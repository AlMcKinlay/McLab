a lot of pokemon news for it being the (2:05 - 2:08)
25th (2:07 - 2:10)

a year of music and we've had a post (2:12 - 2:17)
malone (2:16 - 2:21)
song music takes time (2:17 - 2:23)

nick is pumping out music (2:23 - 2:28)
he gets those jams out every week (2:24 - 2:30)
it's not like the 25th anniversary was a (2:28 - 2:31)
hidden (2:30 - 2:34)
hidden date it's not like it snuck up on (2:31 - 2:35)
them (2:34 - 2:37)
they created a website for it they (2:35 - 2:39)
needed to contact katy perry (2:37 - 2:43)
in at the end of the 20th anniversary (2:39 - 2:44)
and say you have five years to make (2:43 - 2:48)
a pokemon album go uh sure (2:44 - 2:50)
i will i will well let's start off with (2:48 - 2:51)
this pokemon news (2:50 - 2:53)
okay uh things added to the pokemon (2:51 - 2:55)
center this is our new segment (2:53 - 2:57)
because this is this is the thing (2:55 - 2:58)
they've been doing (2:57 - 3:00)
they just keep adding more stuff to (2:58 - 3:04)
pokemon center every week (3:00 - 3:07)
um there was something i wanted what was (3:04 - 3:09)
it so this last week (3:07 - 3:11)
we spent way too long talking about (3:09 - 3:12)
butter dishes (3:11 - 3:14)
and they're sold out we did not talk (3:12 - 3:16)
about it long enough (3:14 - 3:19)
greg we uh that's what i was gonna say (3:16 - 3:21)
controversial we are approaching (3:19 - 3:23)
mayonnaise levels of controversy (3:21 - 3:27)
around here no i we (3:23 - 3:29)
we literally cannot open up that jar i (3:27 - 3:30)
mean yes we can't (3:29 - 3:34)
we can't touch we can't touch that (3:30 - 3:37)
but we're getting there who went (3:34 - 3:39)
after you for saying it's not a topping (3:37 - 3:41)
and ignored the fact that i think butter (3:39 - 3:43)
should be abolished (3:41 - 3:46)
is hilarious that i will (3:43 - 3:48)
i will die on the hill of butter is not (3:46 - 3:49)
a condiment (3:48 - 3:52)
correct i like butter yeah enjoy it all (3:49 - 3:53)
you want (3:52 - 3:57)
you live in the land oh dairy wisconsin (3:53 - 3:59)
yeah clearly enough people liked butter (3:57 - 4:01)
or maybe enough people listen to this (3:59 - 4:02)
podcast because the butter dish is sold (4:01 - 4:03)
out now (4:02 - 4:05)
the the salt and pepper shake is gone i (4:03 - 4:07)
should have bought the butter dish when (4:05 - 4:08)
i had the chance and i (4:07 - 4:11)
didn't i don't really regret (4:08 - 4:15)
not getting it but i feel like now it's (4:11 - 4:16)
a collector's item i feel like i want it (4:15 - 4:18)
more than it sold out (4:16 - 4:20)
well you want things more when they're (4:18 - 4:21)
sold out or a rule (4:20 - 4:24)
that sounds about right yes scarcity is (4:21 - 4:25)
your (4:24 - 4:26)
attractor like i didn't care about the (4:25 - 4:28)
monster hunter collector's edition (4:26 - 4:32)
until i couldn't find it (4:28 - 4:32)
let's not get will started on that bit (4:32 - 4:36)
of business right there this is not a (4:34 - 4:37)
monster hunter podcast but (4:36 - 4:41)
boy oh boy have i got angers (4:37 - 4:44)
the frustrations celebration parade also (4:41 - 4:45)
sold out (4:44 - 4:47)
so don't know what the other ones look (4:45 - 4:48)
like but (4:47 - 4:51)
can't worry about that train nope it's (4:48 - 4:52)
all gone now (4:51 - 4:54)
the new things they added they didn't (4:52 - 4:55)
add a bunch of new stuff they added (4:54 - 4:59)
five new all over (4:55 - 5:02)
t-shirt prints um they added a (4:59 - 5:04)
gigantomax line of eevee (5:02 - 5:07)
snorlax toxtricity pikachu charizard (5:04 - 5:09)
they're 25 bucks they're all over prince (5:07 - 5:11)
which what does that mean what does an (5:09 - 5:12)
all-over print (5:11 - 5:13)
all over is like on the sleeves on the (5:12 - 5:15)
back the design goes wraps all the way (5:13 - 5:16)
around (5:15 - 5:20)
um they're polyester (5:16 - 5:20)
like they kind of seem like the same (5:21 - 5:25)
thing made out of like soccer jerseys (5:23 - 5:27)
yeah they look like jerseys also they (5:25 - 5:28)
did (5:27 - 5:31)
charizard kind of dirty with the face (5:28 - 5:34)
yeah his face is all cranked up i'm (5:31 - 5:35)
sorry the pikachu (5:34 - 5:37)
face if on the wrong body looks kind of (5:35 - 5:39)
like it's melting (5:37 - 5:42)
yes they're not (5:39 - 5:44)
they're okay i think the ev1 is the best (5:42 - 5:45)
if we're (5:44 - 5:48)
talking only looks yeah they're not (5:45 - 5:48)
great (5:48 - 5:53)
i mean they're like the ev1 (5:48 - 5:56)
oh that charizard one is some bad news (5:53 - 5:59)
yeah what a mistake (5:56 - 6:02)
it's yeah they i feel like they made (5:59 - 6:04)
different choices with the eevee one (6:02 - 6:06)
than they made anywhere else i feel like (6:04 - 6:08)
the ev1 was the last one they made after (6:06 - 6:10)
they figured out how to do it they were (6:08 - 6:11)
like oh okay (6:10 - 6:13)
we got it because like charizard wraps (6:11 - 6:15)
around and the face (6:13 - 6:20)
is not on the back the tail is and like (6:15 - 6:23)
you get a weird side view of pikachu on (6:20 - 6:24)
the back and toxicity is all over the (6:23 - 6:26)
place and then yeah how do they mess up (6:24 - 6:26)
pikachu (6:26 - 6:28)
why is it too pikachu like the pikachu (6:26 - 6:30)
it should just be pikachu's back and (6:28 - 6:30)
butt (6:30 - 6:32)
yeah but for evie they said okay we'll (6:30 - 6:34)
do a face on the front and the face in (6:32 - 6:34)
the back (6:34 - 6:38)
yeah which is also kind of weird and (6:34 - 6:40)
also snorlax apparently lives in your (6:38 - 6:41)
armpit (6:40 - 6:44)
it's it's they added uh two play mats as (6:41 - 6:45)
well (6:44 - 6:49)
um and then they added the tcg deck box (6:45 - 6:51)
the tcg sleeves (6:49 - 6:53)
uh i picked up the deck box i'm a sucker (6:51 - 6:55)
for duck boxes their deck boxes are (6:53 - 6:56)
normally pretty nice (6:55 - 6:58)
uh and they have like magnets in them do (6:56 - 7:00)
you have a deck that you're putting into (6:58 - 7:01)
said deck box (7:00 - 7:03)
no but i have enough cards that i can (7:01 - 7:05)
just put garbage cards (7:03 - 7:07)
into the deck box and then they're held (7:05 - 7:09)
for like five years and then i open it (7:07 - 7:12)
and i go oh these cards and then i put (7:09 - 7:14)
them back (7:12 - 7:17)
why why are you keeping garbage cards (7:14 - 7:19)
i don't know because it feels weird to (7:17 - 7:21)
throw them away or (7:19 - 7:24)
no one wants them well well at one point (7:21 - 7:26)
once you get enough garbage cards (7:24 - 7:28)
then you sell them to like troll and (7:26 - 7:30)
toad or cool stuff and then you get like (7:28 - 7:30)
20 (7:30 - 7:32)
bucks don't you have like a local place (7:30 - 7:33)
that you can say i want to unload my (7:32 - 7:34)
commons (7:33 - 7:37)
no i did go to a local place okay let's (7:34 - 7:38)
get into tcg minute (7:37 - 7:40)

one day (7:53 - 7:57)
they put up pokemon tcg sword and shield (7:54 - 7:59)
battle style (7:57 - 8:01)

sleeving yes um they sold out (8:12 - 8:20)
in about 10 minutes which i once again (8:16 - 8:23)
frustrated and angry because i was told (8:20 - 8:26)
by a certain twitch streamer slash (8:23 - 8:27)
podcast host (8:26 - 8:30)
that this set would not sell out because (8:27 - 8:32)
there's no charizard (8:30 - 8:35)
and there's no pikachu there (8:32 - 8:38)
was someone at target that bought 40 (8:35 - 8:42)
boxes or cases or whatever in one fell (8:38 - 8:43)
swoop (8:42 - 8:46)
that's true explain yourself okay i will (8:43 - 8:48)
i will explain (8:46 - 8:50)
i will explain myself in one easy (8:48 - 8:52)
sentence for this pokemon center listing (8:50 - 8:54)

10 cards (9:22 - 9:27)
official listing final sale item (9:23 - 9:30)

limit of 72. well 72 packs it's like two (9:30 - 9:37)
boxes worth (9:35 - 9:39)
what (9:37 - 9:39)
how do you let how you if (9:40 - 9:45)
anyone knows about that maybe they don't (9:43 - 9:47)
know i don't (9:45 - 9:50)
did look according to the pokemon (9:47 - 9:53)
company doesn't have the internet we are (9:50 - 9:53)
in a (9:53 - 9:56)
tcg drought and they're saying the (9:53 - 9:58)
purchase limit is (9:56 - 10:01)
72. that's only two boxes worth that's (9:58 - 10:04)
not that much (10:01 - 10:07)
why is it not 10 well it's like i go to (10:04 - 10:08)
barnes noble (10:07 - 10:10)
i go to barnes noble and they have the (10:08 - 10:11)
tcg cards (10:10 - 10:14)
locked behind the counter in the front (10:11 - 10:17)
area and they have a bunch of booster (10:14 - 10:18)
packs and it's limit two (10:17 - 10:21)
and you're like i don't want to wait in (10:18 - 10:22)
a 45 minute line (10:21 - 10:25)
in a pandemic at a barnes and noble to (10:22 - 10:26)
buy (10:25 - 10:29)
two booster it's not worth my time (10:26 - 10:31)
but it would have been worth your time (10:29 - 10:33)
to buy 72 (10:31 - 10:36)
right off the internet yes off the (10:33 - 10:37)
internet from the official pokemon go (10:36 - 10:41)
or 280 plus tax man that is more than (10:37 - 10:44)
two boxes would it cost you just to buy (10:41 - 10:46)
yeah well like i feel like maybe (10:44 - 10:47)
purchase limit six (10:46 - 10:51)
purchase limit 10 72 though (10:47 - 10:53)
but maybe they know that they're the (10:51 - 10:56)
company and they can just make more (10:53 - 10:59)
but yeah they should have a print to (10:56 - 11:00)
sell like (10:59 - 11:02)
pipeline i mean that is under their (11:00 - 11:04)
control they (11:02 - 11:06)
they now control the market you buy 72 (11:04 - 11:07)
here (11:06 - 11:09)
and then when it's sold out they're like (11:07 - 11:10)
a haha we'll we'll (11:09 - 11:12)
print more and put it on our website (11:10 - 11:14)
unless maybe they were like (11:12 - 11:18)
this is the same website that i (11:14 - 11:20)
was looking at sitting cuties and i was (11:18 - 11:21)
like ah (11:20 - 11:22)
sweet check out this bad monetrix (11:21 - 11:24)
sitting cutie and then it's like you're (11:22 - 11:26)
clicking too fast banned you're a bot (11:24 - 11:28)
can't be here anymore it's like well now (11:26 - 11:29)
i'm banned from pokemon center for 48 (11:28 - 11:31)
hours because i was just trying to check (11:29 - 11:32)
out the zigzagoon butt (11:31 - 11:36)
on on pokemon center (11:32 - 11:39)
i i just look (11:36 - 11:42)
70 okay so they made a choice you don't (11:39 - 11:44)
have to agree with it (11:42 - 11:46)
oh i don't i don't they definitely made (11:44 - 11:48)
a choice to make (11:46 - 11:52)
287 off of a bunch of customers (11:48 - 11:54)
a bunch they probably sold it to like (11:52 - 11:56)
four different people (11:54 - 11:57)
and they were like we're done we're done (11:56 - 11:59)
we're out we did it we only had 500 in (11:57 - 12:00)
stock (11:59 - 12:02)
they did say they were going to make (12:00 - 12:04)
more available yes (12:02 - 12:07)
yeah did they not make more available (12:04 - 12:09)
it's out of stock right now i can't get (12:07 - 12:11)
one (12:09 - 12:14)
so so 72 people (12:11 - 12:16)
could have gotten it one person instead (12:14 - 12:18)
got 72 people's worth (12:16 - 12:22)
done and dusted um so i (12:18 - 12:25)
haven't gone to target in the past week (12:22 - 12:26)
but (12:25 - 12:29)
prior to so we did a charity event for (12:26 - 12:32)
for wwf not the wrestling company (12:29 - 12:33)
wildlife wrestling federation (12:32 - 12:35)
is what i said i thought every time i (12:33 - 12:37)
saw it um (12:35 - 12:38)
we raised six thousand dollars in a (12:37 - 12:40)
weekend for wwe (12:38 - 12:44)
tcg cards yeah and i originally got a (12:40 - 12:45)
booster box from cool stuff inc i (12:44 - 12:47)
pre-ordered it back in january it was (12:45 - 12:49)
120. (12:47 - 12:51)
um i decided to donate the booster box (12:49 - 12:52)
to the charity cause (12:51 - 12:55)
so if somebody donated money i would (12:52 - 12:56)
just mail them a boo (12:55 - 12:57)
i opened the booster pack mail them to (12:56 - 12:59)
the booster pack they didn't have to pay (12:57 - 13:00)
for shipping none of the money went to (12:59 - 13:02)
the booster pack 100 went to charity (13:00 - 13:05)
and then my friend danny phantom who (13:02 - 13:06)
runs a tcg store (13:05 - 13:09)
i used to like that tv show that was a (13:06 - 13:11)
good one that was a very good show (13:09 - 13:13)
uh he donated a booster box to the cause (13:11 - 13:14)
so shout out to danny (13:13 - 13:18)
and so we had two booster boxes um (13:14 - 13:21)
but with that being said we oversold (13:18 - 13:23)
because tiltify like broke for a second (13:21 - 13:25)
so we only had 72 boosters but we sold (13:23 - 13:27)
80 something (13:25 - 13:32)
oh who's the pokemon center now um (13:27 - 13:34)
and uh i did see because i went to my (13:32 - 13:37)
local game store board game barrister (13:34 - 13:39)
and i was like oh i'm you know i haven't (13:37 - 13:40)
bought penny sleeves in a long time but (13:39 - 13:42)
i need penny sleeves and i need like the (13:40 - 13:45)
top loaders and they don't sell top (13:42 - 13:46)
loaders at target (13:45 - 13:48)
i mean they sell like pokemon they sell (13:46 - 13:50)
like binders and sleeves but i need top (13:48 - 13:51)
loaders to ship (13:50 - 13:53)
and they had all that stuff i was like (13:51 - 13:55)
super surprised they had penny sleeves (13:53 - 13:56)
actually had a penny so it was a hundred (13:55 - 13:58)
sleeves for a dollar and then they had (13:56 - 14:00)
um they had top loaders but i found top (13:58 - 14:01)
loaders in my house (14:00 - 14:03)
but they had a bunch of battle styles (14:01 - 14:05)
behind the counter (14:03 - 14:07)
and i was like oh cool like you guys the (14:05 - 14:08)
etbs are up there (14:07 - 14:11)
and the the lunch boxes up there and (14:08 - 14:12)
they had (14:11 - 14:14)
multiple booster boxes up there and i (14:12 - 14:17)
was like oh maybe i'll i'll pick up some (14:14 - 14:20)
i was like just a odd question how much (14:17 - 14:21)
is your etb (14:20 - 14:24)
and they were like oh 75 dollars and i (14:21 - 14:27)
was like (14:24 - 14:30)
well i mean you get that coin (14:27 - 14:30)
an etb is normally forty dollars correct (14:31 - 14:35)
eight booster packs (14:34 - 14:37)
if you do eight times four that's thirty (14:35 - 14:39)
six dollars so you're paying an extra (14:37 - 14:40)
four (14:39 - 14:43)
dollars for like the box and the sleeves (14:40 - 14:45)
and the coins (14:43 - 14:47)
um and the energy cards you get the (14:45 - 14:49)
energy cards you do get uh you do get (14:47 - 14:50)
the energy cards and then i was like oh (14:49 - 14:52)
how much is uh (14:50 - 14:54)
gosh how much is a booster box so (14:52 - 14:56)
booster box msrp (14:54 - 14:59)
is 149 or whatever (14:56 - 15:02)
um which is four dollars a pack and they (14:59 - 15:04)
were like oh it's 169 and i was like uh (15:02 - 15:05)
that's not (15:04 - 15:08)
as bad as as bad (15:05 - 15:11)
but she's 170 it's so weird because like (15:08 - 15:12)
a year ago you're paying (15:11 - 15:13)
a hundred dollars for a booster box (15:12 - 15:15)
you're getting 36 packs and now it's (15:13 - 15:16)
like oh you're paying (15:15 - 15:20)
70 extra dollars for the same amount of (15:16 - 15:21)
cards because of demand (15:20 - 15:23)
but they had it they they had battle (15:21 - 15:25)
styles in stock (15:23 - 15:27)
the barnes noble had battle styles in (15:25 - 15:28)
stock uh i've (15:27 - 15:30)
heard from people in our slack that (15:28 - 15:32)
they've found battle styles at target (15:30 - 15:36)
it's it's been easier to find just not (15:32 - 15:39)
as um (15:36 - 15:41)
yeah just not as easy it's easier to (15:39 - 15:43)
find did you buy the box or not (15:41 - 15:45)
no i didn't buy them yeah the last time (15:43 - 15:47)
i was at target they did not have (15:45 - 15:51)
any any pokemon they only had the bad (15:47 - 15:53)
magic sets i wonder if the target the (15:51 - 15:55)
time forgot has stuff though (15:53 - 15:57)
where's that one uh you know where the (15:55 - 15:58)
micro center is (15:57 - 16:00)
yes there's a target over there that's (15:58 - 16:02)
literally only accessible (16:00 - 16:05)
through crypt like a weird maze and it's (16:02 - 16:06)
by the senior center (16:05 - 16:08)
and nobody goes there whenever i'm (16:06 - 16:10)
looking for something that has sold out (16:08 - 16:12)
i will go to the target the time forgot (16:10 - 16:14)
and they almost always have it wow i'm (16:12 - 16:16)
i'm heading there after we finish (16:14 - 16:17)
recording (16:16 - 16:20)
i got stuff to buy (16:17 - 16:20)
um i don't know so go back to the (16:20 - 16:24)
pokemon center.com (16:23 - 16:26)
i like the tcg boxes just because (16:24 - 16:27)
they're (16:26 - 16:29)
like i think they're more collectible (16:27 - 16:31)
than play mats playmats are just like (16:29 - 16:33)
uh where you're gonna put it you only (16:31 - 16:35)
have so much surface area in your house (16:33 - 16:37)
you roll it up oh yeah i got a stack of (16:35 - 16:40)
like 30 play mats in my closet right (16:37 - 16:42)
a bunch of play mats the sleeve the (16:40 - 16:44)
sleeves like the tcg sleeves will (16:42 - 16:45)
eventually just fall apart (16:44 - 16:48)
yep um true and i already have (16:45 - 16:51)
400 different sleeves from all the etbs (16:48 - 16:52)
i've purchased in the last like six (16:51 - 16:53)
years (16:52 - 16:55)
so i definitely don't need sleeves so i (16:53 - 16:57)
feel like the deck boxes are like a good (16:55 - 16:59)
they're 12.99 it's like a good simple (16:57 - 17:00)
collectible (16:59 - 17:03)
eventually if i decide to play irl i (17:00 - 17:05)
have them i guess (17:03 - 17:08)
yeah i legit haven't opened the deck box (17:05 - 17:10)
i bought at worlds (17:08 - 17:12)
it's still in the plastic that one too (17:10 - 17:14)
that's the uh (17:12 - 17:17)
i have the nashville one as well though (17:14 - 17:20)
playing the little banjo (17:17 - 17:22)
yeah i like those uh the other thing (17:20 - 17:23)
that added to pokemon center before we (17:22 - 17:25)
move off this topic is they added uh (17:23 - 17:26)
they partnered with (17:25 - 17:30)
moleskin and they added did they (17:26 - 17:32)
change the price wait what the heck what (17:30 - 17:33)
do you mean (17:32 - 17:36)
they legit change the price oh i got an (17:33 - 17:39)
easy what are you (17:36 - 17:42)
talking about okay so they added two (17:39 - 17:43)
moleskin notebooks (17:42 - 17:47)
yeah and (17:43 - 17:51)
i bought the smaller one and it is (17:47 - 17:53)
which cover art did you get yeah the (17:51 - 17:55)
smaller one is the all yellow one (17:53 - 17:58)
mostly yellow one yeah and (17:55 - 18:04)
it's 22.99 and i only paid 14.99 for it (17:58 - 18:07)
it increased the price by seven dollars (18:04 - 18:10)
sounds about right it's got a pikachu on (18:07 - 18:11)
it with some flowers it looks very (18:10 - 18:13)
french (18:11 - 18:16)
and then the bigger one is now 33 (18:13 - 18:18)
dollars and it was (18:16 - 18:22)
25 man oh it's got a mimikyu (18:18 - 18:25)
i like it it also has a yamper butt on (18:22 - 18:25)
it (18:25 - 18:30)
yeah it does here's the thing i (18:25 - 18:33)
always think oh i'm going to get this (18:30 - 18:35)
notebook and i'll use it (18:33 - 18:37)
and then i never yeah that's not what i (18:35 - 18:38)
do (18:37 - 18:40)
yeah oh i do a heck ton of notebooks i'm (18:38 - 18:41)
all right (18:40 - 18:45)
i use college ruled 1.99 notebooks from (18:41 - 18:47)
target (18:45 - 18:50)
every time well maybe if you spent 22.99 (18:47 - 18:52)
on a fancy notebook you'll feel (18:50 - 18:53)
compelled (18:52 - 18:55)
absolutely with your fountain pens i (18:53 - 18:57)
feel like i have nothing (18:55 - 19:00)
fancy to put into a fancy notebook and (18:57 - 19:01)
therefore i never use them (19:00 - 19:04)
because putting like d stats into a (19:01 - 19:06)
fancy notebook feels (19:04 - 19:09)
weird yeah i agree writing down i mean (19:06 - 19:11)
it feels weird until you do it enough (19:09 - 19:11)
times (19:11 - 19:14)
[Laughter] (19:11 - 19:16)
and then this is kind of like normal i (19:14 - 19:17)
mean i bought that i bought a moleskine (19:16 - 19:18)
notebook (19:17 - 19:22)
literally to to put free form (19:18 - 19:25)
notes so that i could perform a wedding (19:22 - 19:27)
and i still haven't used the actual (19:25 - 19:29)
notebook itself because i printed out (19:27 - 19:31)
pages and just shoved them in (19:29 - 19:33)
so that i wouldn't ruin the notebook (19:31 - 19:34)
ruin (19:33 - 19:37)
the notebook ruin the device that was (19:34 - 19:38)
specifically made (19:37 - 19:41)
for writing in i feel like i have better (19:38 - 19:43)
thoughts to put into a fancy notebook (19:41 - 19:46)
i feel like greg you would be all about (19:43 - 19:47)
the moleskine (19:46 - 19:50)
i'm all about buying them and then i (19:47 - 19:52)
can't you bring myself to use that what (19:50 - 19:55)
i've always like moleskin is like the (19:52 - 19:56)
the ferrari (19:55 - 20:00)
of notebooks right like heck no (19:56 - 20:00)
toyota corolla ferrari ferrari of which (20:02 - 20:06)
decade because that (20:05 - 20:10)
that brand really changes value from the (20:06 - 20:11)
70s (20:10 - 20:13)
moving past like in the 70s you're (20:11 - 20:15)
talking about ferrari being the greatest (20:13 - 20:17)
thing in the world (20:15 - 20:19)
nowadays does anybody talk about is (20:17 - 20:22)
there even a 2020 (20:19 - 20:25)
yes ferrari oh they still make ferraris (20:22 - 20:26)
don't you worry yes (20:25 - 20:28)
does it look like a shoe the problem (20:26 - 20:30)
greg is that we don't chase cars anymore (20:28 - 20:31)
because it's like (20:30 - 20:33)
shameful you're not driving a fully (20:31 - 20:35)
electric vehicle shame on you (20:33 - 20:37)
right so you can't brag about my (20:35 - 20:39)
beautiful ferrari that you guys i don't (20:37 - 20:40)
talk to you guys i don't show you (20:39 - 20:42)
because you're all gonna be like look at (20:40 - 20:42)
you (20:42 - 20:46)
earth killer yeah with your gas guzzling (20:42 - 20:49)
hyper drive wait what's up what's a (20:46 - 20:50)
better notebook than a moleskin (20:49 - 20:52)
wait we don't know because we can't (20:50 - 20:54)
afford them oh they're better nails (20:52 - 20:55)
better notebooks than most i mean the (20:54 - 20:58)
fact that i can go to m street in dc to (20:55 - 20:59)
the moleskine store (20:58 - 21:01)
and buy a moleskine and walk out of it (20:59 - 21:02)
at (21:01 - 21:03)
that store for under a hundred dollars (21:02 - 21:06)
means it ain't fancy (21:03 - 21:09)
i mean how how fancy you're gonna make (21:06 - 21:14)
paper dude what are you what (21:09 - 21:17)
do you realize you have not used enough (21:14 - 21:19)
paper to know the differences between (21:17 - 21:20)
paper (21:19 - 21:22)
oh i went to graphic design school i (21:20 - 21:25)
know the differences of paper but yeah (21:22 - 21:28)
on a tablet and a wish you've only ever (21:25 - 21:30)
done things in the virtual world you (21:28 - 21:31)
kids (21:30 - 21:33)
you never had to put it in a typewriter (21:31 - 21:34)
and know what weight (21:33 - 21:37)
paper was i know wait you're bleeding (21:34 - 21:39)
now you gotta get that organic (21:37 - 21:44)
single source paper from the forests of (21:39 - 21:45)
untouched (21:44 - 21:48)
unpolluted nepal where it's (21:45 - 21:51)
washed in the tears of the buddhist (21:48 - 21:54)
nuns in their their peace and weeping (21:51 - 21:55)
for the world that's where you get your (21:54 - 21:56)
paper from (21:55 - 21:58)
that is where you get the elegance of (21:56 - 22:00)
writing right there (21:58 - 22:02)
your inks can only be sourced from the (22:00 - 22:06)
finest non-pokemon beetles (22:02 - 22:06)
uh well i'll i'll let you know when my (22:06 - 22:09)
uh (22:09 - 22:13)
15 notebook arrives compared to the now (22:09 - 22:15)
22 dollar price notebook (22:13 - 22:18)
but this was the second time they they (22:15 - 22:18)
messed up (22:18 - 22:20)
it recently because they put those (22:18 - 22:22)
lanyards on (22:20 - 22:25)
those lanyards were like 30 bucks yeah (22:22 - 22:26)
and then (22:25 - 22:27)
like a couple days later they changed it (22:26 - 22:29)
to 12.99 (22:27 - 22:31)
hopefully they refunded people but this (22:29 - 22:33)
isn't the first time pokemon and (22:31 - 22:34)
moleskine have (22:33 - 22:37)
have done a collaboration because when i (22:34 - 22:39)
was at pax east in (22:37 - 22:42)
2019 there was a little (22:39 - 22:44)
moleskine vendor in the shopping mall (22:42 - 22:46)
like a little kiosk and they had a bunch (22:44 - 22:48)
of pokemon (22:46 - 22:50)
yeah yeah i think teens that looked (22:48 - 22:51)
better than this (22:50 - 22:55)
uh mimosa pokemon i feel like if you (22:51 - 22:56)
have a mall (22:55 - 22:59)
kiosk you can't call your brand fancy (22:56 - 23:03)
yes correct true there you go (22:59 - 23:03)
or if you're featured in a mall i don't (23:04 - 23:07)
think it was a moleskine mall (23:06 - 23:10)
kiosk i think it was a fancy notebook (23:07 - 23:11)
they had the inventory (23:10 - 23:15)
and they had moleskines yes (23:11 - 23:15)
we have anything else on pokemon center (23:18 - 23:22)
uh (23:21 - 23:26)
i'm looking i'm looking at then these (23:22 - 23:27)
new releases that are (23:26 - 23:30)
sure to disappoint oh is the magikarp (23:27 - 23:32)
tank back in yet (23:30 - 23:34)

do you think they're going to restock (23:36 - 23:40)
that thing a tank (23:37 - 23:42)
yeah maybe yeah i feel like shirts are (23:40 - 23:44)
easy to make (23:42 - 23:47)
comfy to wear i mean i need to get i (23:44 - 23:48)
need to get in shapes (23:47 - 23:52)
so i can wear said magikarp shirt to the (23:48 - 23:52)
gym (23:52 - 23:54)
and i kind of like that it says doing (23:52 - 23:58)
just fine on it (23:54 - 23:58)
doing just fine not great (24:01 - 24:07)
just fine just fine doing just fine (24:04 - 24:09)
don't worry about it (24:07 - 24:12)
uh this is off pokemon.com hatch clefa (24:09 - 24:14)
igly buff and porygon (24:12 - 24:19)
during the pokemon masters ex egg event (24:14 - 24:22)
march 24th to april 7th (24:19 - 24:24)
um you'll have a chance increased chance (24:22 - 24:25)
of getting eggs from battle (24:24 - 24:28)
um they'll hatch fairy or normal type (24:25 - 24:29)
pokemon (24:28 - 24:32)
uh making their day they the debut in (24:29 - 24:33)
eggs (24:32 - 24:36)
are clefa igle buff and porygon so all (24:33 - 24:37)
three are brand new (24:36 - 24:38)
there's a chance you can hatch a shiny (24:37 - 24:40)
clefa shiny igloo buff shiny poor gun (24:38 - 24:40)
too (24:40 - 24:43)
if that's not enough incentive to hatch (24:40 - 24:44)
lots of eggs (24:43 - 24:47)
greg you'll find that sink pairs you (24:44 - 24:49)
face off against during the egg event (24:47 - 24:50)
will be weak (24:49 - 24:53)
to fairy and normal type except we all (24:50 - 24:54)
got xerneas (24:53 - 24:58)
so i don't know (24:54 - 25:00)
why i need a poor substitute in a (24:58 - 25:02)
hatched egg that i have to (25:00 - 25:05)
try to raise up did you just say weak to (25:02 - 25:07)
normal type (25:05 - 25:11)
uh that's what it says yes this doesn't (25:07 - 25:14)
exist this doesn't this is not (25:11 - 25:16)
our universe there is nothing that is (25:14 - 25:19)
weak to normal type (25:16 - 25:19)
don't think about it because there's (25:22 - 25:25)
nothing that is normal (25:23 - 25:28)
things on the island run a bit (25:25 - 25:29)
differently than you would (25:28 - 25:32)
predict so is this uh passio is that the (25:29 - 25:33)
casio (25:32 - 25:37)
yeah remind me not to visit there (25:33 - 25:40)
uh i can't even remember um (25:37 - 25:42)
isn't like most pokemon or like all (25:40 - 25:43)
pokemon masters they're only weak to one (25:42 - 25:44)
thing right (25:43 - 25:45)
yeah they're only weak to one thing so (25:44 - 25:47)
like if you're if you're fighting a vile (25:45 - 25:47)
plume (25:47 - 25:50)
yeah vileplume will only be weak to like (25:47 - 25:52)
fire even though technically violent (25:50 - 25:53)
would be weak to like (25:52 - 25:55)
flying psychic as well or psychic yeah (25:53 - 25:56)
but (25:55 - 25:59)
only fire would do super effectively and (25:56 - 26:01)
sometimes the thing they choose you're (25:59 - 26:02)
like (26:01 - 26:06)
huh okay sure (26:02 - 26:06)
there's one that's four times that you (26:07 - 26:11)
would assume the four times weak thing (26:09 - 26:12)
is the one they'd picked but they didn't (26:11 - 26:15)
so okay i mean they got to keep the game (26:12 - 26:16)
balanced (26:15 - 26:19)
obviously yeah i mean that's why they (26:16 - 26:20)
put (26:19 - 26:23)
support got an eggs (26:20 - 26:23)
look i i i don't mind hatching eggs i (26:24 - 26:29)
i don't mind it i just don't see the (26:27 - 26:31)
point like nothing (26:29 - 26:34)
great comes out of them i actually have (26:31 - 26:34)
to go (26:34 - 26:37)
out of my way to hunt for eggs when i (26:34 - 26:39)
can just use my ten (26:37 - 26:41)
in a day to get my thousand coins on the (26:39 - 26:42)
iris (26:41 - 26:45)
thing to do my random pull it reminds me (26:42 - 26:48)
of purified pokemon and go (26:45 - 26:49)
like they just don't know what to do (26:48 - 26:51)
with it and they're like scared (26:49 - 26:55)
to make any major changes (26:51 - 26:56)
i mean you purify your pokemon because (26:55 - 26:58)
you want to make sure that their hearts (26:56 - 26:58)
are (26:58 - 26:59)
clear and that you're you're that (26:58 - 27:02)
they're your friend and leaving them as (26:59 - 27:03)
a shadow pokemon (27:02 - 27:05)
is actually causing them physical and (27:03 - 27:07)
emotional harm so if you leave your (27:05 - 27:08)
shadow pokemon (27:07 - 27:10)
a shadow pokemon and pokemon go (27:08 - 27:12)
understand that you (27:10 - 27:16)
are the monster of pocket monsters yes (27:12 - 27:18)
okay that's fine with me yeah because (27:16 - 27:20)
much like (27:18 - 27:23)
an unopened pack of pokemon trading card (27:20 - 27:26)
game cards a shiny (27:23 - 27:30)
unpurified monster in pokemon go is (27:26 - 27:30)
worth (27:30 - 27:32)
so much more it's worth nothing (27:30 - 27:33)
[Laughter] (27:32 - 27:36)
nothing and people will look at it and (27:33 - 27:38)
go oh you don't care about people (27:36 - 27:41)
it is a future investment i also take my (27:38 - 27:43)
shopping cart and just put it (27:41 - 27:45)
in the parking spot next to where i (27:43 - 27:46)
parked my car and leave it there and (27:45 - 27:47)
drive away (27:46 - 27:51)
yes that is me i am the darkest (27:47 - 27:54)
of evils you are dark and evil it should (27:51 - 27:56)
not be allowed to continue your (27:54 - 27:57)
existence (27:56 - 28:00)
cart i actually go around the parking (27:57 - 28:01)
lot and i get (28:00 - 28:03)
one shopping cart and put it in each (28:01 - 28:06)
empty space i can find (28:03 - 28:10)
this is how i derive pleasure in life (28:06 - 28:13)
did i ever tell you about the uh (28:10 - 28:16)
the paragraphs long (28:13 - 28:19)
complaint people had that my local (28:16 - 28:20)
target built a row (28:19 - 28:24)
of electric car charging stations (28:20 - 28:26)
at le they're literally the furthest (28:24 - 28:28)
parking spot away from (28:26 - 28:31)
the entrance they are the last row and (28:28 - 28:32)
there was (28:31 - 28:37)
pages days long complaints that they are (28:32 - 28:40)
wasting parking spaces the spaces that (28:37 - 28:43)
nobody parks in that are never full to (28:40 - 28:44)
convert them (28:43 - 28:46)
to electrical charging stations people (28:44 - 28:47)
were (28:46 - 28:50)
outraged so go fill those up with (28:47 - 28:55)
carts i mean i do that too (28:50 - 28:55)
they're never used ever (28:56 - 29:00)
um the anthem comes out in a couple days (29:01 - 29:08)
i've been saving my coins give me (29:04 - 29:10)
because i have not pulled on any banners (29:08 - 29:13)
and i'm finally up to 12 000 coins (29:10 - 29:17)
to pull to get the best (29:13 - 29:20)
champion in existence (29:17 - 29:22)
diana (29:20 - 29:22)
she had her opportunity to stop lysander (29:23 - 29:26)
and she (29:26 - 29:30)
didn't she had a career (29:26 - 29:31)
look he's not gonna have a career when (29:30 - 29:34)
he knows what blows up the world (29:31 - 29:36)
exactly everybody knows that it was (29:34 - 29:38)
sycamore's job to take care of his (29:36 - 29:39)
boyfriend (29:38 - 29:42)
and he didn't do it really he didn't he (29:39 - 29:44)
he even admits after that whole thing (29:42 - 29:45)
and you go to the other town he's like (29:44 - 29:46)
yeah my bad (29:45 - 29:48)
i should have taken care of my boyfriend (29:46 - 29:51)
but i did i was too busy trying to (29:48 - 29:54)
unbutton the top part of my shirt uh (29:51 - 29:57)
so thanks for taking care of my of my (29:54 - 29:59)
dirty laundry for me (29:57 - 30:00)
oh did he almost destroy the world (29:59 - 30:02)
whoops let's have a battle i'll give you (30:00 - 30:04)
a pokemon format (30:02 - 30:07)
doesn't uh didn't lysander make the uh (30:04 - 30:08)
facetime (30:07 - 30:10)
in that game yes uh the holocaust yeah (30:08 - 30:11)
yeah yes (30:10 - 30:13)
yeah yeah he did yeah he did one good (30:11 - 30:15)
thing as i on (30:13 - 30:17)
one of the past few nights they've all (30:15 - 30:18)
grown into a blur (30:17 - 30:22)
watched the complete pokemon generation (30:18 - 30:25)
series every single cartoon in order (30:22 - 30:28)
wow from the first one to the last (30:25 - 30:31)
uh missing (30:28 - 30:34)
one of the x and y ones was featuring (30:31 - 30:35)
how lasander (30:34 - 30:37)
made the hollow caster i realized i (30:35 - 30:39)
never finished the alola (30:37 - 30:42)
series because i have famous journeys (30:39 - 30:43)
now (30:42 - 30:45)
yeah in the anime and they reference (30:43 - 30:47)
things that happened in alola and that's (30:45 - 30:48)
how i remembered like (30:47 - 30:51)
oh i never saw the end of that none of (30:48 - 30:53)
this makes sense (30:51 - 30:55)
um i don't know where i left off in (30:53 - 30:57)
journeys (30:55 - 30:58)
oh i remember there's like an episode (30:57 - 31:00)
with milotech (30:58 - 31:03)
and phi bass and i was like i'm so mad i (31:00 - 31:04)
watch this episode because it was all (31:03 - 31:06)
filler (31:04 - 31:08)
it happened yeah there's a lot of filler (31:06 - 31:10)
the weird thing that you've done with (31:08 - 31:10)
this series is (31:10 - 31:13)
sometimes they do two 15-minute episodes (31:10 - 31:14)
like they admit (31:13 - 31:17)
we did i'm cool with that that's fine (31:14 - 31:20)
like the man the milotic one should have (31:17 - 31:21)
been 15 minutes (31:20 - 31:24)
the most recent one of team rocket where (31:21 - 31:25)
they actually reference team rocket (31:24 - 31:27)
being aware that they're stuck in (31:25 - 31:29)
only a 15-minute episode is actually (31:27 - 31:30)
quite funny but it's (31:29 - 31:33)
strange cause i'm like you know when i (31:30 - 31:35)
was a young adult (31:33 - 31:37)
i used to have to sit through 30 minutes (31:35 - 31:38)
of this garbage (31:37 - 31:40)
not 15 minutes when you were a young (31:38 - 31:41)
adult (31:40 - 31:43)
this didn't even come out until you were (31:41 - 31:45)
26. you're an adult adult (31:43 - 31:49)
that's a young adult comparison to where (31:45 - 31:49)
i (31:49 - 31:54)
am now there there's only been like (31:49 - 31:57)
maybe three filler episodes in 20 some (31:54 - 31:58)
episodes i've seen (31:57 - 32:00)
but the my problem with the milotic (31:58 - 32:02)
episode is they've just done it before (32:00 - 32:05)
it's just like girl is (32:02 - 32:07)
made fo like my like everyone thinks (32:05 - 32:08)
feedback is a garbage pokemon (32:07 - 32:10)
they're not wrong and then like it (32:08 - 32:12)
evolves and then everyone's like oh my (32:10 - 32:13)
gosh this is the most beautiful pokemon (32:12 - 32:14)
ever you (32:13 - 32:16)
you worked hard to make this happen yes (32:14 - 32:18)
the story that they've (32:16 - 32:19)
literally been telling since the ugly (32:18 - 32:22)
duckling a tried and true fairy tale (32:19 - 32:23)
they told it again (32:22 - 32:25)
wait till you hear that romeo and juliet (32:23 - 32:28)
was copied into west side story (32:25 - 32:31)
amongst many other other other shows (32:28 - 32:33)
it's just shocking they took an entire (32:31 - 32:35)
episode to be like (32:33 - 32:37)
look guess the feedback is going to (32:35 - 32:38)
evolve if if (32:37 - 32:40)
if you don't see the growth did they (32:38 - 32:42)
even grow (32:40 - 32:44)
yeah i think journeys is awesome i just (32:42 - 32:45)
think that's actually (32:44 - 32:46)
really good except for the fact that it (32:45 - 32:48)
makes the world feel really super (32:46 - 32:49)
weirdly small (32:48 - 32:52)
i think they don't they don't they don't (32:49 - 32:54)
they don't they just lean into harder in (32:52 - 32:55)
the most recent section i'm like all (32:54 - 32:56)
right (32:55 - 32:58)
it's fine i mean we know they have (32:56 - 33:00)
wormholes in the pokemon universe (32:58 - 33:03)
so i mean to be fair in the game you can (33:00 - 33:04)
fly from one place to the other (33:03 - 33:06)
instantly (33:04 - 33:08)
you don't know if it's instant or not (33:06 - 33:10)
they just you don't see the passage of (33:08 - 33:12)
time (33:10 - 33:12)
speaking of the passage of time let's (33:14 - 33:18)
take a break (33:16 - 33:21)
and that's a good transition i think wow (33:18 - 33:21)

all players must require to register (37:43 - 37:47)

battlefly (37:49 - 37:53)
account to participate i've never heard (37:50 - 37:54)
of battlefly (37:53 - 37:56)
battlefly is what the players cup has (37:54 - 37:58)
been running through already (37:56 - 38:02)
it's just like a laddering system (37:58 - 38:02)
and other games use it too like league (38:02 - 38:05)
of legends and (38:04 - 38:08)
fortnite and stuff it's it's pretty well (38:05 - 38:10)
supported (38:08 - 38:13)
but yeah players cup three we haven't (38:10 - 38:13)
even seen (38:13 - 38:15)
who wins i think they're still like (38:13 - 38:17)
doing the top (38:15 - 38:19)
i think they got down to top 16 for each (38:17 - 38:20)
region (38:19 - 38:24)
but we don't have any we don't (38:20 - 38:26)
that tournament's not over but this the (38:24 - 38:28)
qualifying (38:26 - 38:33)
stuff for this is in like two weeks so (38:28 - 38:35)
and it is even though we're going back (38:33 - 38:36)
to series seven (38:35 - 38:40)
for vgc stuff which is like no legends (38:36 - 38:42)
this will be series eight so it'll still (38:40 - 38:44)
be your (38:42 - 38:46)
one legend probably they're going to be (38:44 - 38:48)
zashi and or groudon or kyogre or (38:46 - 38:53)
evital iveltal however you say that one (38:48 - 38:56)
evil tall groupon kroger (38:53 - 38:59)
kroger uh are they gonna do like the (38:56 - 39:02)
whole like we ban the top 10 that were (38:59 - 39:03)
used in the previous tournament (39:02 - 39:05)
that kind of thing or is it just no (39:03 - 39:07)
legends or only one legend or blah blah (39:05 - 39:08)
blah it is (39:07 - 39:10)
just the same rule set as before the (39:08 - 39:16)
legend rule set no bands or anything (39:10 - 39:19)
did i not sh maybe i (39:16 - 39:21)
i maybe they've always wanted to do (39:19 - 39:22)
money maybe it was like (39:21 - 39:24)
legally hard to do in the past and they (39:22 - 39:26)
got to it or maybe (39:24 - 39:28)
so i feel like there's like maybe two (39:26 - 39:29)
reasons (39:28 - 39:31)
they wanted to do it all along but it (39:29 - 39:33)
took a while to get to this point (39:31 - 39:35)
and or maybe participation wasn't as (39:33 - 39:36)
good as they wanted it to be (39:35 - 39:38)
and players go up three so they decided (39:36 - 39:40)
to add money to have more people (39:38 - 39:42)
participate (39:40 - 39:43)
a combination of the two are you (39:42 - 39:45)
planning on participating (39:43 - 39:48)
yeah uh i don't love series eight (39:45 - 39:52)
i don't love the zashian (39:48 - 39:55)
kroger meta that exists (39:52 - 39:58)
but i mean it's a weekend of you know (39:55 - 40:00)
doing matches so it's it's pretty low a (39:58 - 40:01)
bar of entry (40:00 - 40:05)
but you enjoy playing pokemon vgc uh (40:01 - 40:09)
yeah that was not the qualified (40:05 - 40:12)
yes that was like a ring endorsement (40:09 - 40:12)
here (40:12 - 40:16)
and what we get was uh if i have to (40:12 - 40:18)
i was i i was super bummed i didn't (40:16 - 40:20)
qualify for players cup three because (40:18 - 40:21)
literally (40:20 - 40:23)
if i would have won one extra match i (40:21 - 40:24)
would have (40:23 - 40:27)
been good and i messed up and that was (40:24 - 40:27)
my bad (40:27 - 40:30)
it's for me it's it's it's funny because (40:27 - 40:33)
i i've had coaching for vgc and my coach (40:30 - 40:34)
is always like i don't (40:33 - 40:36)
know how you can stream and (40:34 - 40:40)
competitively battle at the same time (40:36 - 40:42)
lack of focus thing you mean yeah no i'm (40:40 - 40:44)
very focused but it's still very (40:42 - 40:47)
nerve-wracking with your chat i don't (40:44 - 40:49)
think you're that focused (40:47 - 40:52)
i mean to be fair i've been on those (40:49 - 40:53)
streams when (40:52 - 40:56)
he's actually focusing and he does not (40:53 - 40:57)
interact with chat (40:56 - 41:01)
they are an in-between match distraction (40:57 - 41:03)
because everything is on time delay and (41:01 - 41:05)
you can't actually see what he's doing (41:03 - 41:06)
because he's covered up in case there's (41:05 - 41:07)
snipers (41:06 - 41:11)
and he's got this look on his face (41:07 - 41:11)
what do i do here what's the play here (41:11 - 41:18)
what do i do here why are you recreating (41:15 - 41:20)
my stream right now people have that (41:18 - 41:23)
you're setting expectations you know (41:20 - 41:26)
if it's not the same weekend i'd be (41:23 - 41:27)
willing to (41:26 - 41:32)
uh take a crack at the tcg stuff (41:27 - 41:35)
because there is a cramer ant deck (41:32 - 41:38)
what does cameron do is it v max cramer (41:35 - 41:39)
and v max (41:38 - 41:41)
there there is a cramaran and a (41:39 - 41:43)
cremerant v (41:41 - 41:47)
um so the deck so kramer is a colorless (41:43 - 41:50)
pokemon i mean that's appropriate birds (41:47 - 41:52)
flying flying type is colorless yes (41:50 - 41:54)
because remember greg all the birds used (41:52 - 41:56)
to be normal flying so that (41:54 - 41:58)
that fighting would have half a chance (41:56 - 41:59)
so (41:58 - 42:03)
uh kramer ant has a three (41:59 - 42:06)
colorless move called spit shot and you (42:03 - 42:07)
discard all the energy from this pokemon (42:06 - 42:10)
and this attack does 160 damage to (42:07 - 42:12)
any one of your opponent's pokemon so (42:10 - 42:13)
you can (42:12 - 42:17)
active something on the bench yeah nice (42:13 - 42:21)
and then the v-max is (42:17 - 42:24)
uh three colorless max jet flip a coin (42:21 - 42:25)
for (42:24 - 42:27)
uh each energy attached to this pokemon (42:25 - 42:30)
this attack does 80 damage for each (42:27 - 42:31)
heads (42:30 - 42:35)
so you can do one small 80 160 240. (42:31 - 42:38)
not the greatest move but (42:35 - 42:40)
the reason you play cramerant is because (42:38 - 42:42)
there's a porygon z (42:40 - 42:44)
and porygon z's ability is you can (42:42 - 42:48)
attach any amount of colorless energy (42:44 - 42:50)
to any of your pokemon in any way you (42:48 - 42:52)
want (42:50 - 42:53)
so there's so you don't play any normal (42:52 - 42:55)
energy you just play all different (42:53 - 42:58)
like the recycle energy the special (42:55 - 42:59)
energies (42:58 - 43:02)
you play all different special energies (42:59 - 43:04)
and then the porygon lets you attach (43:02 - 43:06)
them all (43:04 - 43:08)
so it's pretty cool and i think it won a (43:06 - 43:10)
korean tournament (43:08 - 43:13)
uh recently it could happen (43:10 - 43:17)
but i like playing with i think (43:13 - 43:18)
will feels the same way i like playing (43:17 - 43:20)
decks with pokemon you actually enjoy (43:18 - 43:21)
using (43:20 - 43:25)
or you like i mean i did have a victini (43:21 - 43:26)
deck that was literally for (43:25 - 43:29)
victini and a couple of energies and a (43:26 - 43:30)
bunch of junk (43:29 - 43:33)
so yes you are correct (43:30 - 43:36)
um and this deck this deck uh (43:33 - 43:38)
fits my although like the dominant deck (43:36 - 43:41)
is adp like i think out of that korean (43:38 - 43:43)
tournament if you looked at the top 16 (43:41 - 43:44)
i'm pretty sure (43:43 - 43:47)
11 of the 16 were adp can you put adp (43:44 - 43:51)
in your camera rant deck uh some adp's (43:47 - 43:51)
run (43:51 - 43:53)
one cramarat because they run they want (43:51 - 43:55)
that they want that snipe shot because i (43:53 - 43:56)
think de dene (43:55 - 43:59)
um gx is exactly 160. yeah anything that (43:56 - 44:01)
can do direct damage to the bench (43:59 - 44:06)
is worth looking at definitely (44:01 - 44:06)
um anyways players cup is coming (44:06 - 44:12)
uh we'll see how active people are for (44:09 - 44:14)
that (44:12 - 44:14)
okay we have um last bit of sword shield (44:15 - 44:19)
news already over by the time this (44:18 - 44:22)
podcast comes up they did a floral event (44:19 - 44:24)
uh this is their first event what was (44:22 - 44:25)
the last event was (44:24 - 44:28)
pikachu for 25 (44:25 - 44:32)
um maybe i don't i think no it wasn't (44:28 - 44:35)
they did the cramer ant event they did (44:32 - 44:36)
the pikachu event i'm trying to think of (44:35 - 44:38)
all the events they did this year alone (44:36 - 44:39)
they did pikachu (44:38 - 44:42)
they did cram (44:39 - 44:42)
they did this one so this one was uh (44:44 - 44:49)
didn't they do a machamp one (44:46 - 44:52)
no this was (44:49 - 44:56)
um shiny liliganth in max raid battles (44:52 - 44:56)
for (44:56 - 45:00)
friday night saturday and then sunday (44:56 - 45:02)
nothing too special here i guess the (45:00 - 45:04)
difference is the little gamp was (45:02 - 45:08)
easier to find i guess it was liligant (45:04 - 45:11)
and the other one uh mantis (45:08 - 45:14)
uh florence romantis (45:11 - 45:19)
laureatis lorantas (45:14 - 45:19)
the last event was okay so i have it (45:21 - 45:24)
here february (45:23 - 45:27)
26-28 was shiny pikachu (45:24 - 45:31)
the problem with the pikachu event (45:27 - 45:35)
was it was a hundred percent all five so (45:31 - 45:36)
i'm just gonna explain how this works (45:35 - 45:38)
because there are some people who (45:36 - 45:41)
are new to the show maybe and (45:38 - 45:43)
every time i do this for stream people (45:41 - 45:45)
are like what's happening what's going (45:43 - 45:46)
on how do you find these (45:45 - 45:50)
just gonna sum it up so they do these (45:46 - 45:51)
events over the weekend (45:50 - 45:54)
they give us zero heads up they turn one (45:51 - 45:55)
pokemon (45:54 - 45:57)
shiny and they give it a certain (45:55 - 45:58)
percentage (45:57 - 46:01)
um that's how the game works so in in (45:58 - 46:03)
the pikachu event last time (46:01 - 46:07)
all five star pikachus all five star (46:03 - 46:08)
raids promoted (46:07 - 46:11)
could be pikachu but there was a two (46:08 - 46:13)
percent chance for pikachu (46:11 - 46:16)
but a hundred percent of the five stars (46:13 - 46:17)
were pikachu (46:16 - 46:20)
which means two divided by (46:17 - 46:24)
um a hundred is one out of fifty (46:20 - 46:26)
so your odds were one out of fifty in (46:24 - 46:27)
this case (46:26 - 46:32)
it was um (46:27 - 46:34)
all five star rates could either be (46:32 - 46:36)
little against vileplume (46:34 - 46:39)
cherum lorentis and comfey but because (46:36 - 46:40)
laurentis was (46:39 - 46:42)
sorry because liliganth was the only one (46:40 - 46:43)
that was (46:42 - 46:46)
the shiny (46:43 - 46:46)
liligant was a 22 percent chance to (46:47 - 46:51)
spawn in five star raids (46:49 - 46:52)
the shiny little against was a two (46:51 - 46:56)
percent so two divided by 22 (46:52 - 47:00)
is 1 in 11. so there's a huge difference (46:56 - 47:02)
between i have a 1 in 11 chance of (47:00 - 47:02)
finding (47:02 - 47:04)
shiny oligarch first i have a 1 in 50 (47:02 - 47:05)
chance (47:04 - 47:08)
of finding shiny pikachu (47:05 - 47:11)
so it was a little bit easier to get a (47:08 - 47:12)
shiny little again (47:11 - 47:15)
this time around but i didn't very few (47:12 - 47:17)
people appreciate the beauty that is (47:15 - 47:19)
little again (47:17 - 47:20)
and pedaling this is a great pokemon it (47:19 - 47:23)
is a fantastic pokemon (47:20 - 47:27)
it's uh very good so and then i think (47:23 - 47:28)
the one before the (47:27 - 47:31)
pikachu was kramer (47:28 - 47:35)
i'm almost positive yes yeah (47:31 - 47:35)
no it wasn't it was a mystery and then (47:35 - 47:40)
it was cramer (47:38 - 47:44)
i forgot about the mystery one yeah (47:40 - 47:45)
which i think i only got one from that (47:44 - 47:47)
one i got one from that one i got no (47:45 - 47:48)
little gant but (47:47 - 47:52)
here's the thing i had to spend like (47:48 - 47:54)
find it my own and then find it shiny to (47:52 - 47:55)
guarantee that i could get a (47:54 - 47:57)
luxury ball and if i was in somebody (47:55 - 47:59)
else's it wasn't guaranteed and at that (47:57 - 47:59)
point (47:59 - 48:02)
i'm just gonna breed a little can shiny (47:59 - 48:04)
in the ball that i want with moves that (48:02 - 48:05)
i want (48:04 - 48:09)
yeah like i feel like the ones where (48:05 - 48:12)
it's something that i can breed myself (48:09 - 48:16)
i tend not to be so oh i'm gonna spend (48:12 - 48:18)
the weekend trying to find one yeah (48:16 - 48:20)
it's really unless it's in my own game (48:18 - 48:21)
i'm not going to get it in the ball that (48:20 - 48:22)
i want (48:21 - 48:25)
uh so i think i did it on friday with (48:22 - 48:26)
y'all (48:25 - 48:29)
like i was on friday night and then my (48:26 - 48:33)
uh switch battery was like i need (48:29 - 48:35)
and then charging happened on screen you (48:33 - 48:36)
got the shiny one (48:35 - 48:39)
i did yeah i got the shiny one i feel (48:36 - 48:40)
like uh sword shield's a little (48:39 - 48:42)
getting a little long in the tooth now (48:40 - 48:44)
it is it really is (48:42 - 48:47)
so like this event was like oh cool like (48:44 - 48:49)
i have something to i have a target to (48:47 - 48:51)
go to right yeah (48:49 - 48:54)
um i mean i played i played with it for (48:51 - 48:55)
a while like right now i'm still (48:54 - 48:57)
breeding for my shiny solo (48:55 - 49:00)
so that i can move all my rejects into (48:57 - 49:01)
home (49:00 - 49:04)
so that i can trade all my rejected (49:01 - 49:06)
solosis for the shiny rosalia that (49:04 - 49:07)
everybody (49:06 - 49:11)
solosis solosis solo no (49:07 - 49:15)
yes it's not a cereal it is it could be (49:11 - 49:18)
it should be a great cereal (49:15 - 49:18)
so i'm still doing that but i don't know (49:18 - 49:22)
i feel like (49:21 - 49:25)
i'm at the point where i think do i want (49:22 - 49:28)
to restart a game of sword and shield (49:25 - 49:31)
like do i want to play through it again (49:28 - 49:33)
because i feel like this is where my (49:31 - 49:34)
third game (49:33 - 49:36)
itch comes in that the one has been out (49:34 - 49:38)
for so long and now i'm like (49:36 - 49:41)
i do want to play from the beginning but (49:38 - 49:43)
i would like it to be slightly different (49:41 - 49:45)
and i guess the two dlcs would be (49:43 - 49:47)
slightly different if i've already (49:45 - 49:48)
played them (49:47 - 49:52)
i don't know yeah i'm feeling is feeling (49:48 - 49:55)
it's feeling like i want to remake a lot (49:52 - 49:59)
sooner than we're gonna get the rebate (49:55 - 50:01)
uh since i'm not that excited over snap (49:59 - 50:02)
although (50:01 - 50:06)
i did watch a preview video of snap (50:02 - 50:09)
and i'm a little bit more sold on it (50:06 - 50:12)
what's getting you in (50:09 - 50:15)
uh so they mentioned like even on the (50:12 - 50:16)
first (50:15 - 50:19)
on the first map there were two possible (50:16 - 50:20)
branching (50:19 - 50:23)
uh paths so uh (50:20 - 50:25)
that at least adds feels like there's (50:23 - 50:26)
replayability the (50:25 - 50:29)
night day cycle uh seemed to have a (50:26 - 50:30)
little bit more (50:29 - 50:32)
playability there like things more (50:30 - 50:34)
things to do it just felt like from that (50:32 - 50:35)
preview (50:34 - 50:39)
they seem to have more things to do than (50:35 - 50:41)
the original snap (50:39 - 50:43)
um well the original snaps like a 45 (50:41 - 50:44)
minute game correct (50:43 - 50:48)
uh so i i'm a little bit more sold on it (50:44 - 50:50)
but i'm still probably just gonna watch (50:48 - 50:51)
somebody play it for a while and (50:50 - 50:55)
see if that's yeah what i wanted yeah (50:51 - 50:57)
will steve be streaming snap on the (50:55 - 50:58)
stream (50:57 - 51:00)
yes yeah okay then that's enough snap (50:58 - 51:02)
for me right there (51:00 - 51:04)
i mean the the the dilemma i have is (51:02 - 51:06)
like (51:04 - 51:08)
probably want to start it during the day (51:06 - 51:09)
and try to play through as fast as (51:08 - 51:10)
possible (51:09 - 51:13)
so when it gets to the evening then you (51:10 - 51:14)
play through at night (51:13 - 51:18)
and then you see everything that changes (51:14 - 51:20)
or you set your clock so that it (51:18 - 51:22)
transitions from day to night in the (51:20 - 51:24)
middle of your streaming (51:22 - 51:26)
that's true get the best of both worlds (51:24 - 51:28)
well we don't know what if (51:26 - 51:30)
the day or night cycle is going to be (51:28 - 51:31)
real time right (51:30 - 51:34)
like we don't know (51:31 - 51:34)
i'm sure it'll just be the switch's (51:34 - 51:38)
clock (51:36 - 51:41)
well don't be so sure it could be like (51:38 - 51:43)
you go on different missions that are (51:41 - 51:45)
different times of the day i mean oh oh (51:43 - 51:47)
i see you so (51:45 - 51:48)
you could just switch day and night yeah (51:47 - 51:52)
i didn't think about that (51:48 - 51:54)
i'm sure we'll get uh one more trailer (51:52 - 51:56)
and probably another info drop (51:54 - 51:58)
i mean the game's a month away now so (51:56 - 52:00)
i'm sure we'll get one more final push (51:58 - 52:03)
of like hey and yet this has been a no (52:00 - 52:06)
news 25th anniversary i'm on their 25 (52:03 - 52:08)
website right now (52:06 - 52:10)

catch stardust (52:30 - 52:35)
uh snivy will have frenzy plant (52:32 - 52:39)

research (52:45 - 52:48)
i think people are happy people like (52:50 - 52:53)
starters (52:52 - 52:58)
true love snivy snivy is cool (52:53 - 52:59)
i've never assumed maybe later this year (52:58 - 53:01)
would then be tepig and oshawa (52:59 - 53:03)
maybe not so close since they're still (53:01 - 53:07)
spacing it out i am still (53:03 - 53:08)
comic-con just announced that they're (53:07 - 53:12)
doing comic-con this year (53:08 - 53:16)
uh which is wild to me what how (53:12 - 53:17)
what they're doing it in november (53:16 - 53:21)
they're doing it over thanksgiving (53:17 - 53:21)
how how did they make that con (53:21 - 53:29)
even worse by putting it on a holiday (53:24 - 53:32)
like you already take (53:29 - 53:34)
literally what i've seen like the like (53:32 - 53:36)
the experience i hate the most which is (53:34 - 53:39)
sitting in line to go to a panel (53:36 - 53:41)
and then you're putting it over a (53:39 - 53:43)
holiday weekend (53:41 - 53:45)
maybe the 200 iq play is preventing (53:43 - 53:48)
these people from spending money (53:45 - 53:51)
at target (53:48 - 53:51)
because they'll spend it all with like (53:51 - 53:55)
mom and pop shops that already charge (53:54 - 53:56)
way too much (53:55 - 53:57)
for the products they bring to a (53:56 - 54:00)
convention valid (53:57 - 54:04)
uh snivy so with with (54:00 - 54:06)
with a better community today i think (54:04 - 54:08)
everyone would agree (54:06 - 54:10)
there has been you know complaints that (54:08 - 54:11)
we've got these you know (54:10 - 54:13)
people complaining about rosalia being (54:11 - 54:15)
recycled which was the best community (54:13 - 54:16)
today and they will hear (54:15 - 54:19)
nothing else sure i'm not disagreeing (54:16 - 54:20)
with you i'm just (54:19 - 54:23)
the other shoe over here (54:20 - 54:23)
what what is the other shoe that is an (54:23 - 54:28)
expression i'm just (54:27 - 54:32)
um yeah i'm just big (54:28 - 54:36)
the other shoe no stop is this from (54:32 - 54:38)
waiting for the other shoe to drop or (54:36 - 54:40)
the shoe is on the other foot (54:38 - 54:44)
which one were you going for (54:40 - 54:44)
walk a mile in somebody else's shoes (54:44 - 54:48)
whichever one fits the best (54:47 - 54:54)
for the analogy no you can't do that (54:48 - 54:57)
so yes i am the other shoe (54:54 - 54:59)
some people were very upset that you (54:57 - 55:01)
know community days have been a bit (54:59 - 55:02)
lackluster but (55:01 - 55:06)
i was in the position of we'll make a (55:02 - 55:08)
blackluster because we can't leave our (55:06 - 55:09)
houses (55:08 - 55:11)
rosalia day was the best community today (55:09 - 55:13)
we had quite a good time doing that (55:11 - 55:16)
incredibly great time with one of the (55:13 - 55:17)
best pokemon (55:16 - 55:19)
out there save the good community days (55:17 - 55:21)
for when it gets nicer and things are a (55:19 - 55:24)
little bit safer outside (55:21 - 55:27)
and so we got styvy i still think any (55:24 - 55:29)

deny that reality you can deny it all (56:29 - 56:33)
you want (56:32 - 56:37)
someday i will be a texan (56:33 - 56:40)
no you will never be a texan (56:37 - 56:42)
not with that attitude no exactly that (56:40 - 56:43)
is the attitude that i (56:42 - 56:47)
am keeping speaking of niantic (56:43 - 56:50)
some non-pokemon go news i feel like we (56:47 - 56:51)
have to talk about this even though it's (56:50 - 56:53)
not pokemon related because niantic is (56:51 - 56:53)
so big (56:53 - 56:56)
niantic and nintendo are teaming up to (56:53 - 56:58)
create a mobile application featuring (56:56 - 57:00)
pikmin (56:58 - 57:03)
uh this is off nintendo dot co dot jp (57:00 - 57:07)
um the first in a series of apps (57:03 - 57:09)
the two companies will develop together (57:07 - 57:10)
i feel like a lot of people miss this (57:09 - 57:11)
point (57:10 - 57:14)
uh the title is so i'm (57:11 - 57:16)
assuming they signed a contract to make (57:14 - 57:18)
multiple games together (57:16 - 57:20)
uh the title is designed to make walking (57:18 - 57:22)
more fun (57:20 - 57:24)
ar technology company niantic (57:22 - 57:26)
headquarters in san francisco (57:24 - 57:29)
ceo john hanke and nintendo headquarters (57:26 - 57:30)
in kyoto (57:29 - 57:37)
uh president uh furuyu (57:30 - 57:40)
kawa firakwa i said that wrong sorry (57:37 - 57:43)
spelled (57:40 - 57:43)
f-u-r-u-k-a-w-a (57:43 - 57:48)
furukawa yeah furukawa that was way (57:45 - 57:50)
better than i did (57:48 - 57:52)
they are partnering together to jointly (57:50 - 57:53)
develop apps (57:52 - 57:56)
with an s that combined diantics real (57:53 - 57:58)
world ar technology with nintendo's (57:56 - 57:59)
beloved characters (57:58 - 58:02)
the first title the two companies are (57:59 - 58:03)
developing (58:02 - 58:05)
are based on the pikmin franchise with (58:03 - 58:06)
gameplay and (58:05 - 58:09)
activities designed to encourage walking (58:06 - 58:10)
and making (58:09 - 58:12)
that activity more enjoyable there's (58:10 - 58:14)
nothing enjoyable about walking (58:12 - 58:17)
would you say i love walking the the app (58:14 - 58:17)
is scheduled (58:17 - 58:21)
to launch later in 2021 niantic is the (58:17 - 58:24)
publisher the title will be the first (58:21 - 58:28)
title created by niantic's tokyo studio (58:24 - 58:31)
niantic developed this studio in april (58:28 - 58:33)
of 2018. (58:31 - 58:35)
i did not know niantic out of tokyo (58:33 - 58:37)
studio they snuck it in there (58:35 - 58:40)
did anybody tell japan they still don't (58:37 - 58:41)
know (58:40 - 58:44)
they apparently didn't i i haven't you (58:41 - 58:45)
know i saw this news all week i didn't (58:44 - 58:46)
see (58:45 - 58:47)
anyone talk about like this is game (58:46 - 58:49)
number one they're making (58:47 - 58:52)
and there will be more games uh i think (58:49 - 58:54)
ever though the whole narrative was like (58:52 - 58:59)
pikmin go i mean (58:54 - 59:01)
i guess i've never played pikmin so i'm (58:59 - 59:02)
not certain (59:01 - 59:05)
what that functionality is oh okay let (59:02 - 59:06)
me just finish the press release and i (59:05 - 59:08)
can tell you what you do (59:06 - 59:11)
this is a quote as we continue to expand (59:08 - 59:12)
our game portfolio (59:11 - 59:14)
it was a natural step to team up with (59:12 - 59:17)
nintendo said john hanke ceo of niantic (59:14 - 59:18)
we are looking forward to shaping the (59:17 - 59:20)
future ar together (59:18 - 59:22)
bringing nintendo's beloved characters (59:20 - 59:23)
to life for a mobile (59:22 - 59:25)
game for players around the world (59:23 - 59:27)
niantic's ar (59:25 - 59:29)
technology had made it possible for (59:27 - 59:30)
experience the world as if pikmin are (59:29 - 59:32)
secretly living around us said (59:30 - 59:35)
miyamoto the resident representative (59:32 - 59:36)
director (59:35 - 59:39)
fellow nintendo based on the theme of (59:36 - 59:41)
making walking fun (59:39 - 59:43)
our mission is to provide people a new (59:41 - 59:44)
experience that is different from (59:43 - 59:46)
traditional games that's what nintendo (59:44 - 59:47)
always says (59:46 - 59:49)
we hope that pikmin and this app will (59:47 - 59:51)
become a partner (59:49 - 59:53)
in your life (59:51 - 59:53)
and the other thing i will mention is a (59:54 - 60:00)
developer working on the game (59:57 - 60:02)
tweeted that they are they've been (60:00 - 60:03)
working on this for a long time (60:02 - 60:04)
they're very excited and they (60:03 - 60:06)
specifically said in their tweet (60:04 - 60:09)
this is nothing like pokemon go so wow (60:06 - 60:12)
[Music] (60:09 - 60:15)
100 true (60:12 - 60:18)
okay so pikmin there's three of the (60:15 - 60:19)
games (60:18 - 60:21)
pikmin 1 pikmin 2 pikmin 3. pikmin 3 (60:19 - 60:22)
came out on wii u (60:21 - 60:25)
no one bought it or played it that is (60:22 - 60:26)
not true (60:25 - 60:28)
then they remade it for the switch that (60:26 - 60:30)
is still pikmin 3. (60:28 - 60:31)
miyamoto did say that they're working on (60:30 - 60:33)
pikmin 4 (60:31 - 60:36)
for whatever that's worth uh pikmin are (60:33 - 60:38)
these little creatures that flower (60:36 - 60:38)
creatures (60:38 - 60:41)
you the the general story of the game is (60:38 - 60:42)
the same your (60:41 - 60:45)
your spaceship crashes on a pikmin world (60:42 - 60:47)
it broke breaks apart and then you (60:45 - 60:49)
befriend the pikmin (60:47 - 60:51)
and then the pikmin help bring your ship (60:49 - 60:53)
parts back together (60:51 - 60:57)
and then fight boss monsters right (60:53 - 60:58)
usually monsters are protecting ship (60:57 - 61:01)
parts and then you build your ship and (60:58 - 61:01)
then you (61:01 - 61:03)
save you cry because you're leaving the (61:01 - 61:05)
pikmin and then you fly away that's the (61:03 - 61:06)
whole game (61:05 - 61:09)
that doesn't have a lot of replayability (61:06 - 61:12)
um no not really because (61:09 - 61:14)
it's like a puzzle game right like yeah (61:12 - 61:16)
uh how do i get this duracell battery (61:14 - 61:16)
it's (61:16 - 61:18)
actually a duracell battery you know (61:16 - 61:20)
it's like a lemmings (61:18 - 61:23)
thing you know your people are somewhat (61:20 - 61:24)
expendable (61:23 - 61:26)
that's that's kind of like where i i (61:24 - 61:28)
have been confused because i thought it (61:26 - 61:30)
was like lemmings and boy oh boy was i a (61:28 - 61:32)
huge lemmings fanboy (61:30 - 61:34)
when that game was available yeah it's (61:32 - 61:37)
got a lemmings quality to it although (61:34 - 61:39)
uh to be fair lemmings don't do that (61:37 - 61:40)
that was disney literally driving them (61:39 - 61:41)
off a cliff for (61:40 - 61:44)
film footage livingston oh that was yes (61:41 - 61:47)
just fyi fact or fiction but we were (61:44 - 61:47)
talking about the (61:47 - 61:50)
video the game fleming's no relationship (61:47 - 61:54)
to real lemmings there are probably at (61:50 - 61:54)
least (61:54 - 61:59)
two ways to get your items um (61:54 - 62:01)
but most of it is just like i'm just (61:59 - 62:03)
gonna throw six pikmin at this battery (62:01 - 62:04)
and then they're gonna carry the (62:03 - 62:06)
battery back and that's it yep and there (62:04 - 62:08)
there might be a different way to get (62:06 - 62:09)
the battery but i'm like why would you (62:08 - 62:12)
just not do the basic of like (62:09 - 62:13)
i'm just gonna throw these over and (62:12 - 62:15)
there we go (62:13 - 62:18)
so i would yeah they're cute i don't i'm (62:15 - 62:20)
sure they're (62:18 - 62:21)
there's a hardcore pikmin fan listening (62:20 - 62:23)
being like no there's a million (62:21 - 62:24)
different ways (62:23 - 62:26)
i'm sure there is probably unlock the (62:24 - 62:28)
easter eggs that get you the mega (62:26 - 62:29)
spaceship (62:28 - 62:32)
i love the pikmin series i played all of (62:29 - 62:33)
them i think they're great (62:32 - 62:37)
i played one and two i didn't play three (62:33 - 62:42)
uh so i'm excited for this (62:37 - 62:46)
i i mean instead of like instead of (62:42 - 62:47)
catching pikmin you're just going to (62:46 - 62:49)
walk across and pluck them out of the (62:47 - 62:50)
ground (62:49 - 62:54)
and then stops are going to be (62:50 - 62:55)
parts that you have to pick up and throw (62:54 - 62:57)
hey hey hey this is nothing like pokemon (62:55 - 62:58)
go (62:57 - 63:01)
pokemon go just like ingress is nothing (62:58 - 63:04)
like pokemon go (63:01 - 63:04)
wink i think nah ingress is pretty (63:04 - 63:08)
different (63:07 - 63:09)
i mean harry potter is also pretty (63:08 - 63:12)
different (63:09 - 63:12)
yes in a way in the way it's the same (63:14 - 63:22)
uh i i i'm (63:19 - 63:25)
curious if the the thought process (63:22 - 63:28)
for nintendo is pikmin 4 isn't going to (63:25 - 63:31)
sell well but if we put out a mobile (63:28 - 63:33)
game for pikmin (63:31 - 63:35)
that gets pikmin more on the radar (63:33 - 63:38)
because i do i do think that pocket camp (63:35 - 63:42)
helped for the switch version (63:38 - 63:45)
but why wouldn't pikmin 4 (63:42 - 63:48)
sell well because pikmin games don't (63:45 - 63:49)
super sell well (63:48 - 63:50)
why are they making them stop making (63:49 - 63:52)
games that don't sell (63:50 - 63:54)
put your resources towards making the (63:52 - 63:55)
trees in pokemon this is why there's not (63:54 - 63:58)
enough zero because there's a bunch of (63:55 - 64:00)
but f zero doesn't sell that well (63:58 - 64:02)
neither does metroid (64:00 - 64:05)
really i've made a lot more metroid fans (64:02 - 64:08)
that's because metroid fans are like (64:05 - 64:09)
crossfit fans they gotta let you know (64:08 - 64:11)
that they like metroid (64:09 - 64:13)
they're very adamant about super metroid (64:11 - 64:14)
and (64:13 - 64:17)
the mother brain and stuff (64:14 - 64:17)
but like metroid and pikmin are in (64:18 - 64:22)
f-zero they're not even (64:21 - 64:25)
close to the level of zelda (64:22 - 64:30)
and mario from eurogamer.net (64:25 - 64:32)
i'm familiar with that deluxe sales grow (64:30 - 64:33)
to series (64:32 - 64:37)
best in japan garden of hope (64:33 - 64:39)
pikmin 3 deluxe has finally become the (64:37 - 64:41)
series best-selling game in japan in (64:39 - 64:42)
terms of physical copies sold (64:41 - 64:45)
they've sold three nintendo's garden (64:42 - 64:47)
strategy three qual (64:45 - 64:49)
i hate this three equal is a bad word (64:47 - 64:52)
yes it is has now shifted (64:49 - 64:55)
how many box copies guess (64:52 - 64:59)
steve i'm gonna go i'm gonna say 1.5 (64:55 - 65:00)
million (64:59 - 65:04)
okay well this is boxes on (65:00 - 65:07)
shelves yep boxed copies oh that's like (65:04 - 65:08)
18 because everybody does (65:07 - 65:11)
digital downloads nowadays uh there's (65:08 - 65:12)
now (65:11 - 65:16)
shifted 513k boxed copies (65:12 - 65:18)
that's not even a million enough to beat (65:16 - 65:20)
the original gamecube's (65:18 - 65:23)
pikmin's lifetime sales it also more (65:20 - 65:25)
than doubled pikmin 3's original sales (65:23 - 65:28)
for when it launched on the wii u that's (65:25 - 65:31)
about the population of wisconsin (65:28 - 65:33)
every single person in wisconsin bought (65:31 - 65:35)
a copy of pikmin (65:33 - 65:37)
here's another great line sure half a (65:35 - 65:39)
million copies sold does not (65:37 - 65:41)
rival mario and zelda's numbers but it's (65:39 - 65:44)
still not bad for a re-release of a (65:41 - 65:44)
third game after (65:44 - 65:48)
oh yeah yeah yeah franchise (65:44 - 65:50)
this is like going back to pokemon where (65:48 - 65:51)
people like like the worst selling (65:50 - 65:53)
pokemon game of all time is crystal (65:51 - 65:55)
and then the second worst selling (65:53 - 65:57)
pokemon game of all time is black 2y2 or (65:55 - 65:58)
whatever (65:57 - 66:01)
right but both those games sold a (65:58 - 66:01)
minimum (66:01 - 66:04)
of 6 million copies (66:01 - 66:06)
[Laughter] (66:04 - 66:08)
and people are like terrible (66:06 - 66:10)
disappointments (66:08 - 66:12)
i know how could they only sell six (66:10 - 66:13)
million pikmin (66:12 - 66:15)
can't even sell a million look and i (66:13 - 66:17)
love pikmin (66:15 - 66:19)
i do i really like pikmin i think (66:17 - 66:20)
they're great (66:19 - 66:22)
it's at dragging a lake on twitter for (66:20 - 66:25)
your pikmin hot takes please send them (66:22 - 66:26)
to (66:25 - 66:29)
at dragging a lake i will definitely be (66:26 - 66:31)
playing the niantic (66:29 - 66:34)
pikmin game of course for one day (66:31 - 66:36)
i'll play it as long as i played the (66:34 - 66:38)
harry potter thing which i need to get (66:36 - 66:39)
off my phone because they keep sending (66:38 - 66:42)
me updates and i don't care (66:39 - 66:43)
um i played the harry potter game for (66:42 - 66:45)
about five days (66:43 - 66:46)
and then felt like i think i got a week (66:45 - 66:48)
out of it before i was like no (66:46 - 66:50)
i think i would want a simpler game than (66:48 - 66:51)
pokemon go (66:50 - 66:53)
for pikmin so i could manage both (66:51 - 66:55)
because if it's more complicated which (66:53 - 66:56)
it doesn't seem (66:55 - 66:59)
i don't know if it's based on walking i (66:56 - 66:59)
don't (66:59 - 67:02)
like like harry potter was more (66:59 - 67:04)
complicated than go (67:02 - 67:06)
and that's why i feel like i fell off (67:04 - 67:08)
hard because i was like this game wants (67:06 - 67:10)
way too much of me right now (67:08 - 67:14)
um i mean pokemon go wants way too much (67:10 - 67:14)
of me right (67:14 - 67:17)
now so pikmin had better be real basic (67:14 - 67:20)
like jump in jump out i so my (67:17 - 67:22)
imagination is taking me to something (67:20 - 67:25)
along the lines of adventure sync where (67:22 - 67:26)
it will (67:25 - 67:29)
just track your number of steps and (67:26 - 67:32)
you know maybe you can recruit pikmin (67:29 - 67:35)
and then you like say like as i'm (67:32 - 67:37)
walking i'm deploying these particular (67:35 - 67:38)
pikmin types (67:37 - 67:41)
and it's a cookie clicker yeah not like (67:38 - 67:43)
a cookie clicking oh i mean (67:41 - 67:44)
everything is a cookie clicker and (67:43 - 67:46)
everything is not a cookie clip (67:44 - 67:50)
like a tower defense (67:46 - 67:50)
so either way it tracks where you walk (67:50 - 67:54)
and then it says because you had these (67:53 - 67:56)
pikmin in your party these are the (67:54 - 67:58)
resources that you acquired did you get (67:56 - 67:59)
the record (67:58 - 68:02)
resources that you need bring back (67:59 - 68:06)
trips trips never went anywhere dude (68:02 - 68:08)
bring back trips to your own life you (68:06 - 68:10)
have that choice (68:08 - 68:13)
you can bring trims back if you wished (68:10 - 68:13)
nobody else (68:13 - 68:17)
can credit to uh vincent and our slack (68:13 - 68:18)
for the (68:17 - 68:21)
uh players cup news types of pikmin are (68:18 - 68:22)

uh bobby says if you could (69:13 - 69:18)
take a specific video game replace all (69:17 - 69:20)
characters with pokemon which game would (69:18 - 69:23)
it be and why (69:20 - 69:26)
all characters like it's just a world of (69:23 - 69:27)
pokemon (69:26 - 69:29)
yeah because i mean we've tried that (69:27 - 69:30)
with mystery dungeon and seen what an (69:29 - 69:32)
abject failure that piece of hot trash (69:30 - 69:34)
garbage was or maybe are we (69:32 - 69:37)
thinking rumble blast a specific (69:34 - 69:39)
video game isn't the default just animal (69:37 - 69:40)
crossing (69:39 - 69:43)
i mean yeah but let's make it (69:40 - 69:48)
fun let's make it good let's make it uh (69:43 - 69:50)
no i got it what's the one in raccoon (69:48 - 69:52)
city (69:50 - 69:54)
resident evil resident resident evil (69:52 - 69:55)
except (69:54 - 69:58)
everything is pokemon (69:55 - 69:58)
how you get some jump scares i want to (69:58 - 70:02)
say like (70:00 - 70:03)
world of warcraft because i want a (70:02 - 70:06)
pokemon mmo but i don't want a world of (70:03 - 70:07)
warcraft style (70:06 - 70:09)
game they did yokai watching final (70:07 - 70:12)
fantasy they did it keeps coming back i (70:09 - 70:13)
got all the new weapons (70:12 - 70:18)
and they're really good um (70:13 - 70:18)
i would like an actual pokemon card (70:18 - 70:22)
racer like a mario kart (70:21 - 70:27)
but um the pokemon that you put (70:22 - 70:29)
into the cart actually like that does (70:27 - 70:30)
impact on (70:29 - 70:33)
how well the cart like performs pikachu (70:30 - 70:35)
it does like a little electric shock (70:33 - 70:36)
that revs the motor so it goes a little (70:35 - 70:38)
faster (70:36 - 70:40)
uh if you do like an abra you could (70:38 - 70:41)
teleport past (70:40 - 70:45)
jumps so you don't miss the jump (70:41 - 70:47)
uh what other things have we got if you (70:45 - 70:50)
got a drugs (70:47 - 70:50)
it's just heavy and hugs the road better (70:52 - 71:01)
uh venusaur no no no no no grass types (70:56 - 71:04)
throw up obstacles okay so it's like you (71:01 - 71:06)
can throw up a mushroom in front of your (71:04 - 71:07)
opponent (71:06 - 71:09)
or have tropius drop a neck banana (71:07 - 71:11)
poison types cause (71:09 - 71:14)
your opponents to uh the their like fuel (71:11 - 71:15)
gauge (71:14 - 71:17)
drops we're giving out a game to a (71:15 - 71:18)
company for free (71:17 - 71:22)
tmt have you have you met my life (71:18 - 71:26)
no my mario kart (71:22 - 71:28)
is a money-making machine they'll never (71:26 - 71:30)
stick anything else on that (71:28 - 71:32)
i try to think of anything else other (71:30 - 71:34)
games that i (71:32 - 71:37)
am actively playing (71:34 - 71:37)
well i don't want i don't know apex (71:38 - 71:42)
legends but with pokemon i mean loop (71:40 - 71:45)
hero but with pokemon absolutely (71:42 - 71:48)
love shrimps but with pokemon no because (71:45 - 71:50)
shrimps is bad (71:48 - 71:52)
no trims is good you stop playing tramps (71:50 - 71:54)
you can't say trips is good because you (71:52 - 71:55)
have (71:54 - 71:56)
no i stopped playing trips because i (71:55 - 71:59)
lost all my trims data (71:56 - 72:02)
yeah it started over (71:59 - 72:03)
the game and it has so much (72:02 - 72:06)
replayability you can start over that's (72:03 - 72:08)
legit with cookie clicker where my hard (72:06 - 72:09)
drive died (72:08 - 72:11)
and i lost all my cookies and actually i (72:09 - 72:13)
found my trims (72:11 - 72:16)
saved data on my work computer the other (72:13 - 72:18)
day because i had to go through and look (72:16 - 72:20)
in my old folders to make sure it was (72:18 - 72:21)
clean and didn't have personal (72:20 - 72:23)
information i had this thing marked trim (72:21 - 72:24)
so i'm like (72:23 - 72:27)
oh yeah that game i have actually (72:24 - 72:31)
recently started implementing (72:27 - 72:32)
this is gonna sound like it's my idea (72:31 - 72:35)
it's somebody else's idea but it's a (72:32 - 72:36)
cryptocurrency that kind of (72:35 - 72:39)
operates like trips so that's (72:36 - 72:41)
my current trip is that not just like (72:39 - 72:43)
dogecoin or something (72:41 - 72:46)
dogecoin is a cryptocurrency what if we (72:43 - 72:48)
it's like how you generate your (72:46 - 72:50)
cryptocurrency is this is very trump's (72:48 - 72:51)
like (72:50 - 72:54)
what if we took bejeweled but replaced (72:51 - 72:55)
all the jewels with pogba isn't that (72:54 - 72:57)
just pokemon shuffle would you stop (72:55 - 73:01)
could you stop this is a brilliant idea (72:57 - 73:05)
we'll call it pokemon shuffle 2. (73:01 - 73:05)
was bad compared to shuffle shuffle was (73:12 - 73:17)
significantly better (73:14 - 73:20)
the art style of trouser was outstanding (73:17 - 73:23)
what about a puzzle quest (73:20 - 73:25)
oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah (73:23 - 73:27)
puzzle quest (73:25 - 73:30)
so good yes that would be amazing (73:27 - 73:33)
i would like to see a battle puzzle (73:30 - 73:33)
quest (73:33 - 73:37)
pokemon game sold well get on it (73:33 - 73:41)
i'm i'm what about program (73:37 - 73:43)
what are these games programs is it c is (73:41 - 73:44)
it java (73:43 - 73:47)
it's apple apple is not a programming (73:44 - 73:49)
language (73:47 - 73:52)
is it apple's programming language no no (73:49 - 73:53)
that's (73:52 - 73:55)
not that's not real that's not real (73:53 - 73:57)
swift swift oh yeah they (73:55 - 73:59)
did have quota though they moved to (73:57 - 74:01)
swift look (73:59 - 74:03)
nobody's making any pokemon games in (74:01 - 74:05)
apple swift okay (74:03 - 74:07)
not that attitude you don't know what's (74:05 - 74:10)
happening at the niantic studio in japan (74:07 - 74:11)
we didn't even know it existed until 20 (74:10 - 74:15)
minutes ago true uh (74:11 - 74:18)
i mean animal crossing solid i'm trying (74:15 - 74:19)
to look at my phone if there's anything (74:18 - 74:21)
that i'm actively playing that isn't (74:19 - 74:24)
already pokemon related and there isn't (74:21 - 74:26)
what about a pokemon gotcha game where (74:24 - 74:28)
instead of pulling pokemon you pull the (74:26 - 74:29)
trainers (74:28 - 74:33)
off and they come with a pokemon awful (74:29 - 74:35)
the balance alone would be difficult for (74:33 - 74:36)
them to get right plus (74:35 - 74:38)
what i'm sure they would do too many (74:36 - 74:41)
banners and make it really confusing (74:38 - 74:44)
and they would just match trainers up (74:41 - 74:46)
with pokemon that aren't really theirs (74:44 - 74:47)
it would just be strange (74:46 - 74:51)
great willy nilly yep what about (74:47 - 74:54)
a pokemon hear me out okay (74:51 - 74:57)
clash royale (74:54 - 75:00)
i mean you know we'd play it yeah oh (74:57 - 75:01)
gosh (75:00 - 75:04)
clash royale i miss it i do you (75:01 - 75:07)
do you remember how bad that was towards (75:04 - 75:09)
the end there do you remember (75:07 - 75:12)
i've never wanted to throw my phone at a (75:09 - 75:13)
wall (75:12 - 75:16)
until i played clash royale wait i've (75:13 - 75:17)
got a really great idea (75:16 - 75:19)
because we've been focusing too much on (75:17 - 75:20)
video games unless the question (75:19 - 75:22)
specifically said video games or did it (75:20 - 75:25)
say gaming it did it (75:22 - 75:25)
so what about a version of magic the (75:25 - 75:30)
gathering (75:29 - 75:34)
yes except you use pokemon yeah instead (75:30 - 75:36)
of horrible satanic imagery (75:34 - 75:39)
yes i'm in okay i'm into that provided i (75:36 - 75:40)
can (75:39 - 75:43)
do a commander style pokemon game and (75:40 - 75:43)
not (75:43 - 75:47)
just rotate every s i mean but this (75:43 - 75:49)
this concept of mine is so genius good (75:47 - 75:52)
luck finding packs in stores because (75:49 - 75:53)
those cards are gonna (75:52 - 75:55)
sell once they once we get into the (75:53 - 75:57)
stores they will just not be around (75:55 - 75:59)
anymore (75:57 - 76:02)
uh i still want an mmo (75:59 - 76:05)
like still hardcore want an mmo (76:02 - 76:08)
uh pokemon go is there for you it's not (76:05 - 76:10)
there for me (76:08 - 76:12)
that is the bad implementation of an mmo (76:10 - 76:13)
and you know it (76:12 - 76:16)
you can customize your character you can (76:13 - 76:17)
drop money into it (76:16 - 76:19)
i love how the pokemon go battle league (76:17 - 76:22)
is literally the only pokemon battling (76:19 - 76:24)
system that nobody ever wants to do (76:22 - 76:27)
no those like those yeah well you're (76:24 - 76:28)
right those people (76:27 - 76:30)
literally are people out there we're (76:28 - 76:32)
having a competition it's a million (76:30 - 76:33)
dollar prize for the top (76:32 - 76:35)
pokemon go battle league player and it's (76:33 - 76:37)
like no one would ever win that prize (76:35 - 76:38)
because even if you entered the (76:37 - 76:39)
competition you'd like (76:38 - 76:41)
you'd hate the experience so much that (76:39 - 76:43)
you'd quit before you finished (76:41 - 76:45)
what about a street fighter style game (76:43 - 76:48)
but the fighters were pokemon (76:45 - 76:50)
but what if it wasn't street fighter and (76:48 - 76:52)
it was like tekken (76:50 - 76:54)
well i mean tekken's pretty good i mean (76:52 - 76:55)
they're one of the originals (76:54 - 76:58)
i could i could see it (76:55 - 76:58)
what about (76:59 - 77:05)
a balder's gate 3 style game but it's (77:02 - 77:07)
all pokemon (77:05 - 77:09)
and you actually have the story that you (77:07 - 77:10)
follow through and so it's a (77:09 - 77:12)
role-playing game but along the way you (77:10 - 77:13)
collect (77:12 - 77:17)
pokemon and you can use them in battles (77:13 - 77:19)
and you can what the [ __ ] am i now first (77:17 - 77:21)
boss was like a skarmory and at that (77:19 - 77:23)
point it still wasn't super enjoyable so (77:21 - 77:25)
you never beat the skarmory because (77:23 - 77:26)
you're like (77:25 - 77:31)
no thanks (77:26 - 77:35)
well what is our pokemon of the week i (77:31 - 77:38)
who knows i apologize in the (77:35 - 77:41)
in advance for this entire pokemon of (77:38 - 77:42)
the week segment (77:41 - 77:45)
because all i could think of in this (77:42 - 77:46)
transition was a (77:45 - 77:48)
pokemon first person shooter in the most (77:46 - 77:49)
evil way possible (77:48 - 77:52)
well duke nukem forever pokemon 94. (77:49 - 77:54)
there you go (77:52 - 77:56)
all right so greg already knew the (77:54 - 77:57)
answers to this because (77:56 - 78:00)
he looks at my snapchat story every (77:57 - 78:01)
single day (78:00 - 78:04)
yes people still using snapchat yeah you (78:01 - 78:06)
say that every time i mention the fact (78:04 - 78:08)
that i do shiny hunting (78:06 - 78:10)
in the most obscure method possible (78:08 - 78:12)
using snapchat (78:10 - 78:15)
and i watch it if you if you're if you (78:12 - 78:16)
if you're too (78:15 - 78:18)
cool for shiny hunts on twitch or (78:16 - 78:19)
youtube (78:18 - 78:22)
tv or whatever or folks are doing there (78:19 - 78:23)
are these ticky talks (78:22 - 78:26)
or snappy chat caffeine have you seen (78:23 - 78:28)
caffeine streaming service you can only (78:26 - 78:30)
do that on a phone it's real (78:28 - 78:33)
interesting if you're too cool for all (78:30 - 78:34)
those (78:33 - 78:36)
methods that all the kids are actually (78:34 - 78:38)
watching get up on my snapchat and watch (78:36 - 78:39)
me shiny hunt (78:38 - 78:42)
and have conversations with my buddy (78:39 - 78:44)
about (78:42 - 78:46)
anything and everything just i try to (78:44 - 78:47)
keep it clean because i know my niece is (78:46 - 78:50)
on there either way (78:47 - 78:54)
uh has to do with i because they (78:50 - 78:54)
announced (78:54 - 78:56)
brilliant diamond and shining pearl and (78:54 - 78:58)
i was like i'm gonna do (78:56 - 79:02)
a shiny sinnoh pokedex but i'm gonna use (78:58 - 79:05)
that same ditto i've been using for (79:02 - 79:05)
almost (79:05 - 79:10)
10 years because it's from japan (79:05 - 79:12)
and that gives me that masuda method for (79:10 - 79:14)
shiny odds and i was like what's the (79:12 - 79:15)
first (79:14 - 79:19)
sinnoh pokemon that i (79:15 - 79:22)
so no pokedex pokemon that i can breed (79:19 - 79:26)
in galler and (79:22 - 79:29)
it is only possible to be this one after (79:26 - 79:31)
june 17 2020 (79:29 - 79:33)
uh otherwise the first sinnoh pokemon (79:31 - 79:35)
that would be available in gallery would (79:33 - 79:37)
have been magikarp (79:35 - 79:40)
what's the answer (79:37 - 79:40)
skarmory (79:43 - 79:46)
i don't think skarmory is even available (79:47 - 79:51)
in cinno (79:49 - 79:54)
[ __ ] axe well yeah well i'm sure it (79:51 - 79:55)
is it's not a fire pokemon so they (79:54 - 79:57)
probably included it (79:55 - 80:01)
it shanks shanks correct (79:57 - 80:03)
shinx was introduced in the isle of (80:01 - 80:04)
armor (80:03 - 80:08)
to the gala region and therefore became (80:04 - 80:12)
the first sinnoh regional pokedex (80:08 - 80:13)
pokemon (80:12 - 80:16)
that you could actually shiny hunt in (80:13 - 80:21)
galer i don't like it shuffle icon (80:16 - 80:21)
shanks is weird because it's got like (80:22 - 80:26)
this like emo (80:24 - 80:29)
kid like neckband it's wearing the black (80:26 - 80:30)
pants (80:29 - 80:33)
and it's like i'm i'm dark times and (80:30 - 80:34)
it's like but i'm actually electric (80:33 - 80:37)
yeah i also don't like this uh clockwork (80:34 - 80:38)
orange (80:37 - 80:41)
form in pokemon go listed here on (80:38 - 80:42)
bulbapedia (80:41 - 80:46)
not a fan it's got a great shiny though (80:42 - 80:48)
i have no idea what the shiny looks like (80:46 - 80:51)
because i still haven't gotten it (80:48 - 80:54)
it will all gold (80:51 - 80:56)
spoiler alert what if we wanted to (80:54 - 80:58)
discover that (80:56 - 81:00)
i don't need another joltik situation (80:58 - 81:02)
where i breed like six shinies and don't (81:00 - 81:03)
realize it because the only difference (81:02 - 81:04)
is that it has (81:03 - 81:06)
purple eyes (81:04 - 81:06)
[Music] (81:08 - 81:12)
uh yeah shakes is cool i mean it's like (81:10 - 81:14)
a little (81:12 - 81:16)
it's weird when people call shanks a dog (81:14 - 81:18)
because it's definitely (81:16 - 81:21)
like a lion yeah yeah (81:18 - 81:23)
well it's like the one thing i've (81:21 - 81:24)
learned (81:23 - 81:26)
one thing i've learned in pokemon is (81:24 - 81:28)
people don't know the difference between (81:26 - 81:29)
dogs and cats (81:28 - 81:32)
that's correct this is very true (81:29 - 81:34)
i mean it's based off of the mythical (81:32 - 81:35)
sphinx (81:34 - 81:38)
so well but the thing is right you you (81:35 - 81:39)
don't get the one (81:38 - 81:42)
key difference between dogs and cats in (81:39 - 81:43)
pokemon games (81:42 - 81:45)
if they would just reveal this then we'd (81:43 - 81:47)
have the answer (81:45 - 81:50)
dogs poop outside cats poop inside (81:47 - 81:54)
yes also i feel like the cat pokemon (81:50 - 81:56)
should just randomly throw things out of (81:54 - 81:57)
your bag (81:56 - 82:00)
oh then yeah isn't there um i'm pretty (81:57 - 82:00)
sure (82:00 - 82:02)
i have to look this up if you look at (82:00 - 82:04)
all the sprites (82:02 - 82:07)
of back in like gen 5 they're all facing (82:04 - 82:08)
i think right (82:07 - 82:11)
but skitty is the only sprite facing (82:08 - 82:12)
left i think (82:11 - 82:14)
sounds about right yeah sounds about (82:12 - 82:16)
right all right hold on what is this gen (82:14 - 82:20)
five uh yeah i think i think so (82:16 - 82:22)
this is bad this is bad podcasting (82:20 - 82:23)
content (82:22 - 82:26)
we're video now (82:23 - 82:26)
uh as greg is looking this up will give (82:31 - 82:35)
us all right let me (82:34 - 82:38)
okay so so all right here we go and this (82:35 - 82:40)
is why i was apologizing in advance (82:38 - 82:41)
because i don't know where i was when i (82:40 - 82:43)
actually wrote this (82:41 - 82:46)
uh literally unfortunately with a (82:43 - 82:48)
cursory review of my records i have (82:46 - 82:49)
pretty much covered (82:48 - 82:52)
every pokemon newly introduced in the (82:49 - 82:53)
sinnoh region (82:52 - 82:55)
over the years of composing pokemon of (82:53 - 82:56)
the week (82:55 - 82:59)
while i could rehash the pocket monsters (82:56 - 83:02)
that were introduced in 2006 weekly (82:59 - 83:04)
until the new versions are released i (83:02 - 83:06)
don't think our listeners would enjoy (83:04 - 83:07)
that (83:06 - 83:10)
did you know that there were four years (83:07 - 83:12)
between pokemon diamond and pearl games (83:10 - 83:14)
and the pokemon black and white games (83:12 - 83:17)
that was a four year wait for fully (83:14 - 83:19)
original content to arrive (83:17 - 83:22)
march 6 was the 10 year anniversary of (83:19 - 83:24)
the north american release of pokemon (83:22 - 83:25)
black and pokemon white (83:24 - 83:28)
which was not noted with any fanfare 10 (83:25 - 83:30)
years of the greatest pokemon games ever (83:28 - 83:31)
made (83:30 - 83:33)
i watched every episode of pokemon (83:31 - 83:35)
generations on friday night (83:33 - 83:38)
this week's pokemon was not featured in (83:35 - 83:39)
that program (83:38 - 83:41)
if you squid your eyes and look at this (83:39 - 83:43)
week's pokemon you should notice (83:41 - 83:45)
that the ends of its arms look like (83:43 - 83:47)
upper fangs while its knees and lower (83:45 - 83:50)
thorax look like lower teeth (83:47 - 83:52)
the majority of its throat and upper (83:50 - 83:55)
thorax look like a tongue or gaping maw (83:52 - 83:58)
in some ways it looks like this pokemon (83:55 - 84:01)
could be a pre-evolution to guzzlord (83:58 - 84:04)
this week's pokemon can only be found in (84:01 - 84:06)
nature not evolved into on victory road (84:04 - 84:08)
and sinnoh sometimes (84:06 - 84:12)
in a dragon friend safari remember those (84:08 - 84:14)
and in the haina desert through an sos (84:12 - 84:16)
battle (84:14 - 84:18)
you cannot find this week's pokemon in (84:16 - 84:20)
pokemon masters (84:18 - 84:22)
as it appears only the final evolution (84:20 - 84:24)
form was introduced around (84:22 - 84:27)
january 2020. (84:24 - 84:29)
yeah i don't know where i was going with (84:27 - 84:31)

of things that can explode in victory (86:03 - 86:06)
road i'm not (86:04 - 86:09)
very very scary they don't have bombs in (86:06 - 86:10)
pokemon games (86:09 - 86:12)
they do it's called electrode and (86:10 - 86:14)
voltorb ngo dude (86:12 - 86:17)
and graveler true true that's why you (86:14 - 86:18)
just have to have a ghost (86:17 - 86:22)
up front but wait doesn't explode only (86:18 - 86:22)
do (86:22 - 86:26)
as much damage as the hp of the pokemon (86:22 - 86:28)
that explodes (86:26 - 86:32)
no it's worse it's 250 i believe (86:28 - 86:36)
oh okay okay okay but uh a lot of people (86:32 - 86:38)
forgot because i they tell me all the (86:36 - 86:39)
time (86:38 - 86:40)
uh they're like oh don't worry it has (86:39 - 86:42)
sturdy or hey how did you get past 30. (86:40 - 86:44)
sturdy is (86:42 - 86:47)
awfully broken in gen 4. uh sturdy only (86:44 - 86:49)
protects against four moves (86:47 - 86:52)
guillotine horn drill fissure and (86:49 - 86:55)
ooh fissure the other one shielded (86:52 - 86:58)
shear cold sheer cold so you can still (86:55 - 87:00)
one shot a onyx (86:58 - 87:03)
even a fast 30 with a giga drain or (87:00 - 87:05)
whatever (87:03 - 87:07)
um it's a double sword because if you (87:05 - 87:08)
have sturdy (87:07 - 87:10)
you now have a useless ability unless (87:08 - 87:12)
the computer spams like fissure but i (87:10 - 87:13)
don't think the elite four does spam (87:12 - 87:15)
fisher (87:13 - 87:15)
i don't think so i mean fissure only (87:16 - 87:20)
hits (87:19 - 87:24)
