what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:29)
548th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:27 - 0:32)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:29 - 0:36)
with me is Greg hello hello hello (0:32 - 0:38)
uh guess what (0:36 - 0:41)
going to the Asia mall tonight we're (0:38 - 0:45)
gonna go visit all of Asia in Mall form (0:41 - 0:46)
hopefully they'll have more things open (0:45 - 0:48)
when I went (0:46 - 0:50)
uh I heard a couple things have opened (0:48 - 0:53)
so I think (0:50 - 0:54)
I don't know it's a Sunday it's a weird (0:53 - 0:56)
day to go (0:54 - 0:59)
but it was not my choice (0:56 - 1:02)
I went like after a snowstorm so half (0:59 - 1:04)
their parking lot was like well holding (1:02 - 1:07)
snow so there was no spaces to park (1:04 - 1:10)
um speaking of snow Bobby doesn't get (1:07 - 1:11)
any (1:10 - 1:14)
none none at all are you flooded (1:11 - 1:19)
uh no not down here but it is we've been (1:14 - 1:20)
getting a lot of rain well a lot of rain (1:19 - 1:25)
for like California obviously but no no (1:20 - 1:27)
snow no flooding (1:25 - 1:28)
um just (1:27 - 1:29)
just rain (1:28 - 1:32)
just living the good life over here (1:29 - 1:34)
yeah it's like 60 degrees or something (1:32 - 1:36)
right now I don't know 65 degrees that's (1:34 - 1:40)
nice it's good good living (1:36 - 1:43)
all right so for today's episode we have (1:40 - 1:46)
um Pokemon Go stuff we have the scarlet (1:43 - 1:48)
and violet TCG stuff details got (1:46 - 1:50)
announced there and then we have some (1:48 - 1:52)
upcoming scarlet and violet raids on top (1:50 - 1:56)
of they did the 1008 Pokemon video I'm (1:52 - 2:00)
suspecting we all watch that (1:56 - 2:03)
uh so let's uh because that all that (2:00 - 2:05)
stuff is Scarlet Violet let's do the (2:03 - 2:07)
only non-scarlet and violet stuff which (2:05 - 2:10)
is Pokemon go which to me is still (2:07 - 2:11)
always (2:10 - 2:14)
weird that Niantic is on there like (2:11 - 2:17)
we're do if we're celebrating hoen (2:14 - 2:20)
they're a little behind when they got (2:17 - 2:22)
started late (2:20 - 2:24)
I get it but at the same time like there (2:22 - 2:26)
are no rules they could have skipped (2:24 - 2:29)
they could have jumped so early (2:26 - 2:31)
that everything else is celebrating like (2:29 - 2:35)
gen 9 and tonight it's like cheaper guys (2:31 - 2:37)
remember like low test (2:35 - 2:40)
Niantic has their own rules and they (2:37 - 2:41)
will not (2:40 - 2:45)
not not be deterred from them yeah they (2:41 - 2:48)
Atlantic is the Internet Explorer of the (2:45 - 2:51)
Pokemon Universe man I can't wait till (2:48 - 2:55)
they adopt Pokemon go edge (2:51 - 2:55)
oh well uh you know we all thought like (2:56 - 3:05)
uh gen 3 Pokemon was coming and uh (3:01 - 3:09)
everyone wrong I guess because Noibat is (3:05 - 3:13)
is the next Community Day (3:09 - 3:13)
it's a great Community today but they (3:13 - 3:18)
are all over the place (3:16 - 3:18)
um I I think the shocking thing here is (3:19 - 3:25)
how fast they did Noibat like I thought (3:22 - 3:27)
they were gonna milk Noibat for another (3:25 - 3:30)
year uh because it was one of the dragon (3:27 - 3:34)
egg maybe can spawn in the Wild event (3:30 - 3:36)
for the twinkling Disney Channel event (3:34 - 3:39)
that was happening (3:36 - 3:40)
um (3:39 - 3:43)
and it was it was pretty sought after uh (3:40 - 3:44)
there was like another thing where (3:43 - 3:45)
people were like oh I want to grind (3:44 - 3:47)
Noibat eggs or whatever (3:45 - 3:49)
yeah last there was an event a couple (3:47 - 3:51)
months ago yeah where there were no bad (3:49 - 3:53)
eggs because I definitely spent (3:51 - 3:56)
too much money on incubators and trying (3:53 - 3:58)
to hatch a shining like that but like (3:56 - 4:00)
unlike unlike it's a lot of people I'm (3:58 - 4:03)
not mad that there's now a noise (4:00 - 4:06)
and guess what they'll ask you in raids (4:03 - 4:07)
right now and for all you people who are (4:06 - 4:09)
rating and trying to pay for a shiny (4:07 - 4:12)
Axew that will also be a community at (4:09 - 4:15)
some point in the future so (4:12 - 4:16)
yeah (4:15 - 4:19)
axi would be (4:16 - 4:23)
this community this year's Community Day (4:19 - 4:25)
raid (4:23 - 4:27)
yeah not right this year's Community Day (4:25 - 4:30)
because they were in raids for go Fest (4:27 - 4:34)
in 2022. yeah I'm thinking Axew in (4:30 - 4:36)
somewhere between June and August it (4:34 - 4:38)
will be the community day that's my (4:36 - 4:40)
guess just based on how they do that and (4:38 - 4:43)
then Gumi would be like here's your (4:40 - 4:45)
dollar easy like we're gonna milk all (4:43 - 4:48)
these suckers for Goomy things and then (4:45 - 4:49)
all those people are going to be the (4:48 - 4:50)
same people that complain next year when (4:49 - 4:52)
Gumi is a community day because no one (4:50 - 4:55)
has ever learned that this past right (4:52 - 4:57)
look at the calendar look at the (4:55 - 4:59)
patterns look at the patterns what we (4:57 - 5:01)
need is we just needed Bobby you need to (4:59 - 5:03)
create a big murder board (5:01 - 5:06)
with strings and dates and then you can (5:03 - 5:08)
just point to it you can go live on (5:06 - 5:10)
Instagram and say look (5:08 - 5:14)
here's the pattern (5:10 - 5:15)
it's true (5:14 - 5:17)
yeah I don't understand this like idea (5:15 - 5:19)
that (5:17 - 5:21)
um you're just gonna get a shiny and (5:19 - 5:23)
it's gonna be exclusive forever you know (5:21 - 5:25)
it's like no of course not like it's (5:23 - 5:29)
you're paying to get it first right like (5:25 - 5:31)
eventually all of them will be available (5:29 - 5:34)
to everybody in some in some way (5:31 - 5:36)
I mean I guess you could get it to be a (5:34 - 5:39)
lucky shiny a year before anybody else (5:36 - 5:42)
could sure without luck there you go I (5:39 - 5:43)
mean to be fair when I see people (5:42 - 5:46)
walking with the the gallerian birds I'm (5:43 - 5:48)
like oh gosh I wish I could get this and (5:46 - 5:49)
then it's like but then I have to do the (5:48 - 5:52)
15-minute incense and then I gotta walk (5:49 - 5:53)
and then I'm just gonna appear and then (5:52 - 5:55)
I'm not gonna catch it yeah yeah more (5:53 - 5:58)
mad that I didn't catch it look I'm not (5:55 - 5:59)
walking (5:58 - 6:04)
until I am not going to slide down the (5:59 - 6:06)
hill outside my house straight into the (6:04 - 6:08)
river because it is pure ice out there (6:06 - 6:09)
still (6:08 - 6:11)
and half the people are like it's good (6:09 - 6:13)
enough like it's not good enough it's (6:11 - 6:17)
not good enough it's a death strap (6:13 - 6:17)
yeah just just not not Southern (6:17 - 6:23)
California problems I was gonna say like (6:20 - 6:25)
I've been walking every day now just (6:23 - 6:27)
like since the new year and then doing (6:25 - 6:30)
those daily incense and before so I (6:27 - 6:31)
don't know if they've changed like the (6:30 - 6:33)
spawn rate of the gallerian birds but (6:31 - 6:37)
before New Year's I had seen two in the (6:33 - 6:39)
entire time and I've done it like fairly (6:37 - 6:41)
like consistently every day I think two (6:39 - 6:45)
and then since New Year's I've seen (6:41 - 6:49)
three I think so it seems weird that but (6:45 - 6:52)
I could just be a chance (6:49 - 6:55)
they're impossible to catch but (6:52 - 6:57)
these are showing up (6:55 - 6:58)
uh so yeah I know about Community Day uh (6:57 - 7:02)
Noibat does take 400 candy to evolve (6:58 - 7:03)
um (7:02 - 7:06)
uh it's on a Sunday FYI (7:03 - 7:10)
it is Sunday February 5th from two to (7:06 - 7:13)
five they'll have their dollar research (7:10 - 7:16)
three times the Stardust (7:13 - 7:20)
um two times the catch candy two times (7:16 - 7:21)
the chance for (7:20 - 7:25)
uh receiving Excel candy if you're level (7:21 - 7:27)
31 and above (7:25 - 7:31)
um extra special trade 50 less Stardust (7:27 - 7:33)
uh lure will last for three hours (7:31 - 7:35)
incense will last for three hours (7:33 - 7:37)
snapshot (7:35 - 7:40)
uh and why did they still bother saying (7:37 - 7:41)
take a few snapshots during Community (7:40 - 7:44)
for a surprise we know what the surprise (7:41 - 7:47)
is it's not a surprise anymore (7:44 - 7:49)
we know it's going to happen you don't (7:47 - 7:51)
know what cool pose like that is gonna (7:49 - 7:55)
do it's gonna be in this fancy (7:51 - 7:57)
that's it (7:55 - 8:00)
everyone (7:57 - 8:00)
no that's great I am I am excited (8:01 - 8:05)
four-star raids after so you can like (8:03 - 8:07)
extend it because there's no middle (8:05 - 8:08)
Evolution so they're just gonna do (8:07 - 8:09)
Noibat (8:08 - 8:11)
oh really it's not I missed that I (8:09 - 8:13)
thought it's not going to be Noivern no (8:11 - 8:16)
it will still be nice yeah yeah okay (8:13 - 8:19)
that would have been like evolved really (8:16 - 8:21)
bad anyways for four thousand eight (8:19 - 8:24)
million what what wait what how many (8:21 - 8:27)
candies to evolve noise yeah okay four (8:24 - 8:30)
thousand you know that would have been a (8:27 - 8:33)
cool Halloween Pokemon I don't know a (8:30 - 8:37)
very spooky in February I guess (8:33 - 8:39)
who was October's Community today (8:37 - 8:42)
wow it was Litwick sir right yeah it was (8:39 - 8:44)
Litwick it was Litwick yeah so at least (8:42 - 8:46)
it was Halloween themed this year at (8:44 - 8:47)
least there was a Halloween theme and (8:46 - 8:50)
then Rock and Rollo was September I (8:47 - 8:50)
think (8:50 - 8:51)
because yeah that would have been right (8:50 - 8:53)
because the tournament test codes came (8:51 - 8:55)
out yeah (8:53 - 8:58)
um yeah you know 2023 at least starting (8:55 - 9:00)
off strong with two good comedy days (8:58 - 9:03)
Chespin and well I I would argue that (9:00 - 9:05)
they were good you know Everyone likes (9:03 - 9:07)
starters especially a fresh brand new (9:05 - 9:12)
shiny and Noibat very sought after so (9:07 - 9:12)
um (9:12 - 9:16)
yeah uh sure I I guess we'll sure maybe (9:12 - 9:19)
March will disappoint us who knows I (9:16 - 9:20)
will (9:19 - 9:23)
uh last bit of Pokemon good well uh two (9:20 - 9:24)
two more bits uh there's gonna be a new (9:23 - 9:26)
event celebrate the Lunar New Year in (9:24 - 9:29)
Pokemon goes 2023 Lunar New Year event (9:26 - 9:31)
they do this like every year (9:29 - 9:32)
um (9:31 - 9:35)
uh I think this event is kind of bad (9:32 - 9:38)
um but uh Pokemon like Bunnelby and (9:35 - 9:40)
binary will appear more frequently in (9:38 - 9:42)
eggs and in the wild because it's the (9:40 - 9:44)
year of the rabbit wild encounters are (9:42 - 9:46)
going to be Ponyta Magmar Magikarp (9:44 - 9:51)
Slugma numble numo uh Combi binary (9:46 - 9:53)
Fennekin Bunnelby and then if you're (9:51 - 9:57)
some trainers might encounter Flareon or (9:53 - 10:00)
darmaca you'll have an increased chance (9:57 - 10:02)
to get shiny darmaco (10:00 - 10:05)
um so that's cool uh increased chance (10:02 - 10:06)
for Lucky trades (10:05 - 10:08)
uh increased chance to become lucky (10:06 - 10:10)
friends twice the Stardust from opening (10:08 - 10:12)
gifts one additional special trade each (10:10 - 10:15)
day for a maximum of two per day and (10:12 - 10:18)
then uh Traders can choose several (10:15 - 10:20)
reward bonuses during limited research I (10:18 - 10:21)
think this was already (10:20 - 10:23)
data mined or leaked or something where (10:21 - 10:26)
you can choose for more XP or more (10:23 - 10:29)
Stardust no they they and it's on the (10:26 - 10:31)
press release (10:29 - 10:34)
it's like it's a catching one a (10:31 - 10:36)
it's like the branching I thought I (10:34 - 10:37)
remember seeing that on like on the (10:36 - 10:39)
Pokemon Go website where they're like oh (10:37 - 10:41)
no it's not on this website (10:39 - 10:43)
um (10:41 - 10:43)
never mind then I don't know what I I (10:45 - 10:50)
don't know what I saw it (10:47 - 10:50)
I know what data mining website I saw (10:51 - 10:56)
it (10:54 - 11:00)
cheating let's see there there will be (10:56 - 11:01)
um (11:00 - 11:04)
oh wait you were right yeah it does say (11:01 - 11:06)
this okay so it says trainers will be (11:04 - 11:08)
able to access trained time to research (11:06 - 11:11)
this isn't very small text (11:08 - 11:12)
um they will grant wishes for their next (11:11 - 11:14)
one so hatching eggs (11:12 - 11:18)
um for the duration uh of daily (11:14 - 11:19)
they will either revolve around either (11:18 - 11:22)
hatching eggs the duration of daily (11:19 - 11:24)
Adventure incense or collecting Stardust (11:22 - 11:27)
those are the paths you can choose (11:24 - 11:29)
okay well then I definitely read it on (11:27 - 11:31)
some other website because that's not (11:29 - 11:33)
the (11:31 - 11:33)
but it yeah same idea no matter what you (11:34 - 11:39)
pick all trainers will who will be able (11:38 - 11:41)
to complete research will receive a (11:39 - 11:44)
lucky egg and other items they will also (11:41 - 11:45)
have the opportunity to encounter (11:44 - 11:48)
Magikarp azumerel Combusken Darumaka (11:45 - 11:51)
galerian dharamaka and Bunnelby (11:48 - 11:53)
um 7K eggs will have Chingling ryolu (11:51 - 11:57)

three star raids will have Flareon (12:10 - 12:15)
Shuckle Blaziken drodigan Diggersby who (12:11 - 12:16)
in their right mind is gonna be that (12:15 - 12:18)
diggers (12:16 - 12:21)
I am paying a dollar to get them all (12:18 - 12:24)
baby yeah they need they always need to (12:21 - 12:26)
do one there needs to be one three star (12:24 - 12:27)
raid remember when three star raids (12:26 - 12:30)
never had Shiny Pokemon and it was like (12:27 - 12:33)
no one wants to do three star raids (12:30 - 12:38)
there's no reason to do three star right (12:33 - 12:40)
yeah I don't have a shiny dread again I (12:38 - 12:43)
guess yeah whatever that Regice is my (12:40 - 12:45)
favorite rabbit Pokemon I don't know why (12:43 - 12:47)
that's being featured as the five-star (12:45 - 12:50)
life uh if you turn it upside down those (12:47 - 12:53)
legs become rabbit ears it's obvious I (12:50 - 12:55)
can't believe you didn't even see that (12:53 - 12:58)
uh what I hate most about this is that (12:55 - 13:00)
I'm 40 Regis deep without getting a (12:58 - 13:03)
shiny one yet and (13:00 - 13:05)
it just means I'm gonna have to do a few (13:03 - 13:08)
more Regis raids you don't have to there (13:05 - 13:12)
will be in 2050 when we're out (13:08 - 13:17)
crawling around red dice Community Day (13:12 - 13:17)
low punny will make its return also (13:18 - 13:23)
there will be a new backpack in the shop (13:21 - 13:24)
that you can buy it looks like a little (13:23 - 13:26)
Lantern (13:24 - 13:29)
oh that's kind of cute this event is (13:26 - 13:31)
it's like four days right (13:29 - 13:33)
um it is Thursday January 19th to Monday (13:31 - 13:36)
January 23rd so it's not a terribly long (13:33 - 13:37)
event (13:36 - 13:40)
um if you are going to the Hoenn go (13:37 - 13:45)
tour in Vegas uh I guess try to get (13:40 - 13:46)
lucky friends with people if you're (13:45 - 13:48)
gonna see them there (13:46 - 13:50)
um or whatever (13:48 - 13:52)
it's (13:50 - 13:55)
hard don't or don't I don't know I don't (13:52 - 13:57)
know we don't live your life do what you (13:55 - 14:00)
want or don't I don't know (13:57 - 14:02)
um (14:00 - 14:02)
the tour let's not go faster it's just (14:03 - 14:08)
called the Hoenn tour Las Vegas it's (14:06 - 14:12)
sold out as of uh I think this morning (14:08 - 14:15)
uh it will be Las Vegas Nevada February (14:12 - 14:18)
18th to 19th uh you were able to add an (14:15 - 14:19)
extra ticket (14:18 - 14:22)
uh if you wanted to although a little (14:19 - 14:25)
bit of some at some point last week both (14:22 - 14:27)
days were still available but you (14:25 - 14:30)
couldn't buy both days uh so you could (14:27 - 14:32)
buy Sunday or you could buy Saturday but (14:30 - 14:34)
you couldn't like add them together (14:32 - 14:36)
so they were probably (14:34 - 14:38)
I I don't know what's happening on the (14:36 - 14:39)
back end right they probably turned that (14:38 - 14:41)
off and then I think Saturday sold out (14:39 - 14:44)
first because of course it would and (14:41 - 14:46)
then Sunday just sold out this morning (14:44 - 14:49)
the the morning we're recording this so (14:46 - 14:52)
that event is completely sold out now (14:49 - 14:52)
um (14:52 - 14:54)
they didn't say how many people were (14:52 - 14:56)
there I will I will try to ask because (14:54 - 14:58)
Niantic usually doesn't tell me for the (14:56 - 15:00)
record of how many people attend but (14:58 - 15:02)
usually you can find like a security (15:00 - 15:03)
guard or one of those event people that (15:02 - 15:05)
are like because they know because (15:03 - 15:07)
they're told by their event organizers (15:05 - 15:09)
how many people are there so I'll just (15:07 - 15:11)
find a security guard and figure out how (15:09 - 15:13)
many people (15:11 - 15:13)
the way to do it (15:13 - 15:17)
um (15:16 - 15:21)
no clue uh but it I I don't know it's (15:17 - 15:23)
sold out it seems (15:21 - 15:25)
we can only hope that it will be good I (15:23 - 15:27)
don't think Vegas ever gets rain right (15:25 - 15:29)
so at least it won't be rained out right (15:27 - 15:31)
you should be fine (15:29 - 15:36)
yeah it it's a desert it's a yeah yeah (15:31 - 15:38)
I've I've been in Vegas when it's rained (15:36 - 15:40)
before but it once maybe and I've been (15:38 - 15:43)
to Vegas yeah it's not so it's not that (15:40 - 15:45)
common yeah not common there for sure (15:43 - 15:48)
plus look they want you inside at the (15:45 - 15:50)
casinos anyways so if it rains they're (15:48 - 15:52)
just gonna throw your doors open and let (15:50 - 15:54)
you go inside for a while I'm excited to (15:52 - 15:56)
walk around the casinos I have no desire (15:54 - 15:58)
to gamble but I would like I want to see (15:56 - 16:00)
I want to see the uh I want to see the (15:58 - 16:01)
energy (16:00 - 16:03)
um Steve says he has no desire to gamble (16:01 - 16:07)
as he's playing Pokemon go correct yes (16:03 - 16:07)
and they raise because I ain't giving (16:07 - 16:12)
Niantic that dollar (16:09 - 16:12)
I want the description I will click the (16:12 - 16:17)
wild spawns thank you very much I (16:15 - 16:19)
knowing you you will like the energy of (16:17 - 16:23)
Vegas for approximately 20 minutes and (16:19 - 16:26)
then the noise of the casinos because (16:23 - 16:28)
they are loud (16:26 - 16:33)
will send you fleeing for the hills yeah (16:28 - 16:35)
well such a thing for your ear pose (16:33 - 16:36)
because you'll definitely put your (16:35 - 16:39)
earpods to be like nope I'm out well no (16:36 - 16:41)
it's the yeah it's the combo of the (16:39 - 16:43)
Bells and everything going off along (16:41 - 16:45)
with the stale cigarette smell that you (16:43 - 16:50)
will have going through this yeah yeah (16:45 - 16:50)
it's definitely changed but yeah they (16:51 - 16:55)
want to keep everybody (16:53 - 16:57)
here's the thing as much as possible (16:55 - 16:59)
here's the secret here's the secret if (16:57 - 17:00)
you want free drinks at a casino in (16:59 - 17:02)
Vegas (17:00 - 17:05)
take a dollar worth of quarters sit down (17:02 - 17:08)
at a slot machine and play Slowly at (17:05 - 17:11)
some point they will come up to you and (17:08 - 17:13)
ask you if you want to drink because (17:11 - 17:15)
their goal is to give you free drinks to (17:13 - 17:17)
keep you gambling so if you do not want (17:15 - 17:20)
to buy a drink but you want a drink just (17:17 - 17:23)
sit at a slot machine and play slowly (17:20 - 17:26)
and they'll come up and be like okay get (17:23 - 17:27)
you something hun and you're like yeah (17:26 - 17:29)
I'll have a whatever and they'll run off (17:27 - 17:31)
and then you're stuck there because they (17:29 - 17:33)
are doing that for everybody so you're (17:31 - 17:34)
probably stuck there for about half an (17:33 - 17:35)
hour before they get back to you but (17:34 - 17:37)
they will come back to you with a free (17:35 - 17:39)
drink I also heard like the cigarette (17:37 - 17:41)
thing that some don't even do that (17:39 - 17:43)
anymore (17:41 - 17:43)
yeah there are non-smoking casinos now (17:43 - 17:47)
has definitely changed over the years (17:46 - 17:50)
but there are definitely still casinos (17:47 - 17:53)
where you are a lot of smoke (17:50 - 17:55)
um oh yeah and I always love the (17:53 - 17:56)
non-smoking sections of those casinos (17:55 - 17:58)
because it's like (17:56 - 18:00)
still all wafting over there it's not (17:58 - 18:02)
look it's not like that was set up in (18:00 - 18:04)
the 70s I don't know it used to be and (18:02 - 18:06)
we're not straying from it so I mean the (18:04 - 18:08)
higher end the nicer ones the ones that (18:06 - 18:09)
are leading way more into (18:08 - 18:11)
family-friendly stuff and weigh into (18:09 - 18:12)
more being a mall than the casino now (18:11 - 18:15)
they have a lot stricter reels around (18:12 - 18:18)
smoking but believe you me some of them (18:15 - 18:21)
casinos you're like boy this carpet's (18:18 - 18:22)
never been cleaned that's what I was (18:21 - 18:23)
gonna say yeah it's like they could be (18:22 - 18:25)
non-smoking but the just the (18:23 - 18:29)
the sinking in stench of cigarettes from (18:25 - 18:31)
Decades of allowing them will stay (18:29 - 18:35)
decades on decades in the air (18:31 - 18:35)
Let's uh shift gears over here to the (18:37 - 18:46)
TCG stuff so on pokemoncenter.com the (18:41 - 18:48)
scarlet and violet stuff went up for (18:46 - 18:51)
pre-order uh so you could get a booster (18:48 - 18:53)
box which I still don't know who's (18:51 - 18:54)
buying (18:53 - 18:56)
booster boxes from pokemoncenter.com at (18:54 - 18:59)
full MSRP when you there's various sites (18:56 - 19:00)
out there that will sell them to you for (18:59 - 19:01)
like (19:00 - 19:05)
significantly under MSRP but um (19:01 - 19:07)
the one thing on on Pokemon center.com (19:05 - 19:09)
that I think some people gravitate to (19:07 - 19:12)
myself included is the (19:09 - 19:16)
um the elite trainer boxes the Pokemon (19:12 - 19:18)
Center exclusive Elite Trainer boxes (19:16 - 19:20)
which usually just come with two more (19:18 - 19:21)
booster packs and like (19:20 - 19:24)
I don't know one extra thing normally in (19:21 - 19:27)
them but if for whatever reason if you (19:24 - 19:31)
decide to to pre-order that you get a uh (19:27 - 19:33)
Le chunk (19:31 - 19:36)
a promo card (19:33 - 19:38)
you're a limit you're able to uh (19:36 - 19:42)
purchase four of each I did purchase one (19:38 - 19:45)
of each so I did it does give you Tula (19:42 - 19:47)
Chunk on checkout they're not sold out (19:45 - 19:48)
yet they went up for pre-order I think (19:47 - 19:50)
three or four days ago (19:48 - 19:52)
um so I I think (19:50 - 19:54)
I think either two things can happen (19:52 - 19:58)
either or they could be related number (19:54 - 20:02)
one is uh they have they are printing (19:58 - 20:04)
much much many more cards (20:02 - 20:06)
and number two is (20:04 - 20:08)
scalpers don't want to buy these anymore (20:06 - 20:10)
which could be related because they keep (20:08 - 20:14)
just printing more and more cards uh (20:10 - 20:17)
because in the past (20:14 - 20:18)
these Elite Trainer boxes would have (20:17 - 20:21)
crashed the website and would have been (20:18 - 20:22)
sold out in (20:21 - 20:24)
less than five minutes (20:22 - 20:25)
yep (20:24 - 20:30)
but even with a purchase limit of four (20:25 - 20:30)
they're still up there (20:30 - 20:35)
um you also get a so with the Pokemon (20:32 - 20:37)
Center exclusive (20:35 - 20:41)
ETB you also get a second (20:37 - 20:43)
so so the way that they're doing it for (20:41 - 20:45)
scarlet and violet right is (20:43 - 20:47)
um every Elite Trainer block now comes (20:45 - 20:50)
with a promo card inside so like in this (20:47 - 20:52)
in these you can either get the Scarlet (20:50 - 20:54)
box or the Violet box you get um car (20:52 - 20:56)
ride on or ride on like as a promo card (20:54 - 20:58)
inside of it if you get the Pokemon (20:56 - 21:00)
Center exclusive one they give you a (20:58 - 21:01)
second (21:00 - 21:04)
card that looks exactly like the other (21:01 - 21:06)
one except it has a Pokemon Center stamp (21:04 - 21:08)
on the card (21:06 - 21:11)
so if you get an Elite Trainer Box from (21:08 - 21:13)
Target or Walmart or somewhere else (21:11 - 21:15)
it'll you'll get one promo card in the (21:13 - 21:17)
box and if you get the Pokemon Center (21:15 - 21:19)
exclusive one you'll get two and the (21:17 - 21:21)
only difference is one has a Pokemon (21:19 - 21:22)
Center stamp and the other one does not (21:21 - 21:25)
so got it I forgot that we covered the (21:22 - 21:27)
news that like (21:25 - 21:30)
the TCG cards are going up like they the (21:27 - 21:31)
booster packs I think went up like 50 (21:30 - 21:33)
cents and then the etbs went up like (21:31 - 21:35)
five dollars or something like that but (21:33 - 21:36)
they're like we're putting more booster (21:35 - 21:38)
packs in the etvs and we're giving you a (21:36 - 21:42)
guaranteed it's I I don't know yeah it's (21:38 - 21:43)
getting weird with eggs right now where (21:42 - 21:46)
eggs are like nine dollars I guess yes (21:43 - 21:49)
well that's because (21:46 - 21:50)
a lot of bad things have been happening (21:49 - 21:53)
to chickens lately (21:50 - 21:55)
unfortunately chickens aren't chickens (21:53 - 21:57)
aren't doing so good so if you see a (21:55 - 21:59)
chicken out take a moment respect their (21:57 - 22:01)
space they're having a rough time right (21:59 - 22:02)
now all right chicken's having a rough (22:01 - 22:04)
time got it (22:02 - 22:07)
um so Pokey Beach here has a a list of (22:04 - 22:10)
things that were revealed as this is (22:07 - 22:13)
January 13th off pokebeach.com they said (22:10 - 22:16)
that there was the reveal in Japan and (22:13 - 22:18)
this leads to more details for the (22:16 - 22:20)
English scarlet and violet set (22:18 - 22:22)
so they are saying the set will feature (22:20 - 22:27)
12 double rare Pokemon EX including two (22:22 - 22:30)
Terra Pokemon EX this means one Pokemon (22:27 - 22:33)
EX will be cut the Japanese sets and (22:30 - 22:35)
theme decks feature Gardevoir great Tusk (22:33 - 22:39)
Gardevoir ex great Tex ex just assume (22:35 - 22:41)
I'm saying ex after all these Corydon (22:39 - 22:45)
spy dots my voice Vita I really I the (22:41 - 22:48)
the TC if you have not seen the spydops (22:45 - 22:51)
TCG cards I feel like they've finally do (22:48 - 22:55)
spite Ops Justice they're so good they (22:51 - 22:56)
finally do it's been three months since (22:55 - 22:59)
we've even seen this thing exist (22:56 - 23:04)
he's just as served for spite UPS (22:59 - 23:07)
where did you see this (23:04 - 23:08)
uh they should be on Pokemon they should (23:07 - 23:10)
be the article before this one where (23:08 - 23:13)
they have the the cards okay it's very (23:10 - 23:16)
good I will say it is very good I'll be (23:13 - 23:19)
the judge of that meridon baynet why do (23:16 - 23:22)
they keep making Bay Net cards (23:19 - 23:22)
not like a bit that's fine they just (23:23 - 23:28)
like they make a lot of bay night cards (23:26 - 23:32)
um Iron Treads oinklage Lucario see (23:28 - 23:33)
Lucario at least make sense to me (23:32 - 23:37)
Ampharos and mimikyu ex so those are all (23:33 - 23:41)
the exes uh Gyarados ex and Arcanine ex (23:37 - 23:44)
will be the two Terra Pokemon (23:41 - 23:48)
gen 1 strikes again 12 ultra rare (23:44 - 23:51)
Pokemon EX and eight ultra rare (23:48 - 23:53)
supporter cards (23:51 - 23:55)
uh are being reported here these are (23:53 - 23:57)
probably the full arts we know elsewhere (23:55 - 23:59)
the Pokemon company scarlet and violet (23:57 - 24:01)
will feature full art etched cards (23:59 - 24:03)
showcasing Pokemon with simple poses (24:01 - 24:05)
bright colors (24:03 - 24:07)
um the eight Ultra supporters are (24:05 - 24:08)
probably gonna be the full art (24:07 - 24:10)
supporters (24:08 - 24:13)
um 24 illustration rare Pokemon these (24:10 - 24:15)
are called Art rares in Japan we're (24:13 - 24:17)
calling them an English illustration (24:15 - 24:18)
rares (24:17 - 24:21)
10 special illustration rares and rare (24:18 - 24:24)
Pokemon and then supporter cards these (24:21 - 24:26)
are called the special art rares in (24:24 - 24:27)
Japan we are calling them special (24:26 - 24:29)
illustration rares (24:27 - 24:31)
if you notice the Pokemon company will (24:29 - 24:33)
say 10 special illustration rare Pokemon (24:31 - 24:36)
and supporter cards unless we're (24:33 - 24:39)
misunderstanding we we as in Pokey Beach (24:36 - 24:41)
uh it seems that the Pokemon company is (24:39 - 24:43)
saying there might be special (24:41 - 24:46)
illustration rare supporters (24:43 - 24:48)
if so they have not revealed them in (24:46 - 24:50)
Japan yet all of Japan's secret rares (24:48 - 24:52)
will be revealed by next week (24:50 - 24:54)
the Pokemon company is also (24:52 - 24:55)
International is also saying (24:54 - 24:56)
illustration rares and special (24:55 - 24:58)
illustration rare Pokemon will showcase (24:56 - 25:02)
Pokemon in their natural environment and (24:58 - 25:03)
offer a closer look at their unique (25:02 - 25:05)
personalities (25:03 - 25:09)
six hyper rare gold etched cards which (25:05 - 25:11)
include Pokemon EX trainers and energy (25:09 - 25:13)
these are probably the gold cards we've (25:11 - 25:15)
already seen before we've seen this with (25:13 - 25:17)
like Zama zenta zashi and eternitus all (25:15 - 25:18)
that stuff (25:17 - 25:19)
um (25:18 - 25:21)
and then finally this is probably the (25:19 - 25:23)
biggest takeaway from this news is (25:21 - 25:26)
there's no mention of rainbow rares at (25:23 - 25:30)
all in the Japanese set which means that (25:26 - 25:32)
the Rainbow Cards might be (25:30 - 25:35)
done for (25:32 - 25:35)
which I don't know some people like I I (25:35 - 25:39)
liked the rainbow rare some people (25:38 - 25:41)
didn't some people like the older (25:39 - 25:42)
rainbow rares but not the newer rainbow (25:41 - 25:45)
rares uh I liked them all (25:42 - 25:47)
um they're saying the set for English (25:45 - 25:51)
will be over 190 cards (25:47 - 25:53)
and the elite trainer booster boxes on (25:51 - 25:56)
pokemoncenter.com are sixty dollars I (25:53 - 25:59)
think they used to be 55. they were uh (25:56 - 26:02)
no so they used to be so (25:59 - 26:05)
uh well they used to be 50. Pokemon oh (26:02 - 26:06)
yeah Pokemon's under exclusive ones they (26:05 - 26:08)
used to be 50. yeah and the ones that (26:06 - 26:11)
Target used to be 40. but those are (26:08 - 26:14)
going up to 50. and then the Pokemon (26:11 - 26:17)
centers went up from 50 to 60. (26:14 - 26:19)
yeah there was a five dollar increase in (26:17 - 26:20)
there at one point within the last like (26:19 - 26:22)
six months I will say at like Target (26:20 - 26:24)
they were 45 like they had they were (26:22 - 26:26)
creeping up already but yeah now it's (26:24 - 26:29)
gonna be 50 for a non Pokemon Center (26:26 - 26:32)
exclusive ETB and then 60 for the (26:29 - 26:34)
Pokemon Center exclusive ones in us I (26:32 - 26:36)
know in like Canada all these prices are (26:34 - 26:41)
like way higher but uh in the US yeah (26:36 - 26:41)
great what you think of that spider Ops (26:42 - 26:45)
nah nope what it's so good what are you (26:45 - 26:52)
talking about hard pass (26:49 - 26:55)
part one of the hardest paths I can give (26:52 - 26:59)
it no be gone (26:55 - 26:59)
he's whipping the like String Shot (26:59 - 27:06)
it's good (27:03 - 27:06)
that's good it's good it's good that's (27:06 - 27:10)
good (27:08 - 27:13)
um I I think they're really leaning into (27:10 - 27:15)
which I am a fan of but they're really (27:13 - 27:18)
leaning into I guess (27:15 - 27:19)
I assume like the special illustration (27:18 - 27:22)
rares would be like the alt Arts right (27:19 - 27:24)
what we were calling alternate art cards (27:22 - 27:26)
before (27:24 - 27:26)
um (27:26 - 27:29)
but it's cool to see them really lean (27:26 - 27:30)
into that (27:29 - 27:32)
although it will make it a lot harder to (27:30 - 27:33)
collect like if you're trying to get an (27:32 - 27:36)
entire Set uh yeah definitely make it (27:33 - 27:37)
looks like (27:36 - 27:41)
I think my problem with the TCG stuff in (27:37 - 27:44)
the last couple years and I I wanted (27:41 - 27:47)
when when sword and shield came around I (27:44 - 27:50)
wanted to like complete every set (27:47 - 27:53)
um which which ends up being pretty hard (27:50 - 27:54)
because (27:53 - 27:57)
the rainbow rares and the gold rares are (27:54 - 28:00)
are significant like you're lucky if you (27:57 - 28:01)
pull like (28:00 - 28:04)
two or three per 100 booster box right (28:01 - 28:07)
at a certain point (28:04 - 28:11)
like Pokemon go uh TCG definitely (28:07 - 28:14)
benefits from the area you are in so if (28:11 - 28:16)
you're if your friends are collecting (28:14 - 28:19)
TCG or you're going to TCG meetups or (28:16 - 28:21)
like leagues and you have a bunch of (28:19 - 28:24)
extra exes or V cards you could probably (28:21 - 28:26)
trade for the ones you're missing right (28:24 - 28:28)
but if if you if you're collecting by (28:26 - 28:30)
yourself (28:28 - 28:33)
and your only options are to continue to (28:30 - 28:35)
pay more money and to continue to open (28:33 - 28:36)
packs and there's nothing wrong with (28:35 - 28:39)
opening packs opening packs are very fun (28:36 - 28:42)
um or the the smarter option is just to (28:39 - 28:45)
go to like eBay or TCG player and (28:42 - 28:46)
literally just buy like the specific (28:45 - 28:48)
cards you are missing because the (28:46 - 28:50)
likelihood of you buying another 100 (28:48 - 28:53)
booster box and pulling that is probably (28:50 - 28:56)
very slim but (28:53 - 28:57)
um (28:56 - 29:00)
I would maybe assume that the joy of (28:57 - 29:02)
collecting Pokemon cards is like the (29:00 - 29:03)
randomness and the opening the booster (29:02 - 29:04)
packs and like going through the (29:03 - 29:06)
excitement and stuff and not (29:04 - 29:08)
specifically just going to eBay and (29:06 - 29:11)
adding add to cards that that's exciting (29:08 - 29:12)
to me (29:11 - 29:15)
if I enjoy Pig other people for their (29:12 - 29:17)
work and me having to do none of it yeah (29:15 - 29:18)
yeah (29:17 - 29:22)
so um but like also the other problem I (29:18 - 29:25)
so I so if I I guess we'll help it back (29:22 - 29:27)
but back up the first problem I have are (29:25 - 29:30)
these sets are ginormous and the rare (29:27 - 29:32)
cards are pretty rare the second problem (29:30 - 29:35)
I had was like every card could be a (29:32 - 29:39)
reverse Holo including rares so you (29:35 - 29:41)
could get like a hollow rare cramerant (29:39 - 29:44)
right not a full art Cramer Ranch it's (29:41 - 29:45)
like a hollow rare cramerant but you (29:44 - 29:48)
could also get a reverse (29:45 - 29:52)
Hollow crameran but the but like why do (29:48 - 29:54)
I really want both (29:52 - 29:57)
like I I the reverse rare stuff never (29:54 - 29:59)
existed in Japan the reverse rare stuff (29:57 - 30:02)
was only like American and like Italian (29:59 - 30:05)
and German and stuff (30:02 - 30:08)
so are did they get rid of reverse rare (30:05 - 30:11)
is that gone and violet I'm gonna say it (30:08 - 30:14)
the other way around because when they (30:11 - 30:15)
talked about the price increase going to (30:14 - 30:19)
450 a pack there are now for one there (30:15 - 30:22)
are no more non-hollow rares right they (30:19 - 30:24)
said that they got rid of the non-hollow (30:22 - 30:27)
rare so everywhere yeah you could get (30:24 - 30:29)
non-hollow rare Hollow rare or reverse (30:27 - 30:30)
Hollow rare yeah yeah that was the thing (30:29 - 30:33)
too yeah so there are no more non-hollow (30:30 - 30:36)
rares they said there are three Hollow (30:33 - 30:38)
cards a pack now and so technically if (30:36 - 30:41)
you think about it now if there was (30:38 - 30:42)
let's take like Champions path where (30:41 - 30:44)
there are no non-hollow rares right it's (30:42 - 30:46)
all Hollow rares (30:44 - 30:48)
um you'd get two because you get a (30:46 - 30:50)
reverse Hollow and then you get a hollow (30:48 - 30:53)
rare in those packs so I'm assuming (30:50 - 30:56)
there'll be one extra Hollow and will (30:53 - 30:58)
that be a comment like will it be rare (30:56 - 31:00)
will it be common uncommon who knows but (30:58 - 31:01)
it sounds like you're getting three (31:00 - 31:03)
Hollow cards a pack now (31:01 - 31:08)
at least uh because of the or they said (31:03 - 31:09)
like with in conjunction with the price (31:08 - 31:10)
raise (31:09 - 31:13)
so that may even be a bigger problem it (31:10 - 31:15)
might make it might make me uh (31:13 - 31:16)
collecting like a master set even harder (31:15 - 31:18)
I think (31:16 - 31:20)
um Greg you get into this PCG this time (31:18 - 31:22)
around nope (31:20 - 31:26)
well it convince you to get into it (31:22 - 31:26)
I don't see I don't want to collect it (31:29 - 31:35)
right like collecting I have (31:31 - 31:37)
so much (31:35 - 31:39)
that I don't want to collect it like I (31:37 - 31:42)
already have like I meant to keep my (31:39 - 31:44)
magic collection in control and it's not (31:42 - 31:46)
and I have to redo it I had to buy I had (31:44 - 31:49)
to buy (31:46 - 31:49)
this big but this (31:50 - 31:55)
to start collect holding on to stupid (31:52 - 31:59)
magic cards and magic cards I can play (31:55 - 32:01)
commander and they don't Commander means (31:59 - 32:03)
they're always good they don't rotate it (32:01 - 32:05)
the thing that I hate about standard (32:03 - 32:08)
formats is ever like if I have a deck (32:05 - 32:10)
that I really like playing (32:08 - 32:13)
it will quickly become not usable except (32:10 - 32:16)
in very specific (32:13 - 32:18)
formats right like amongst my friends (32:16 - 32:20)
but of course if my friends keep up and (32:18 - 32:22)
get the news Grace because every card (32:20 - 32:25)
game has huge amounts of scope creep and (32:22 - 32:29)
power creep like that is just not (32:25 - 32:33)
fun for me it's not fun to try to keep (32:29 - 32:36)
up now I will say having a deck to go do (32:33 - 32:38)
like the boss battle stuff at (32:36 - 32:41)
conventions getting stuff where the (32:38 - 32:44)
you still have to have a current deck to (32:41 - 32:47)
some extent but like anything goes that (32:44 - 32:50)
appeals to me like I do have my grass (32:47 - 32:52)
deck behind me that I had a lot of fun (32:50 - 32:54)
at Gen Con doing the boss battles with (32:52 - 32:56)
um but (32:54 - 33:00)
I I just don't like the I I understand (32:56 - 33:03)
the necessity for it but I don't like (33:00 - 33:06)
the money investment of a rotating (33:03 - 33:08)
format (33:06 - 33:11)
yeah I like the rotating rotating format (33:08 - 33:13)
because (33:11 - 33:13)
I like playing with new cards and new (33:13 - 33:17)
mechanics and stuff like that and like (33:15 - 33:19)
obviously (33:17 - 33:21)
changing your deck is really fun or it (33:19 - 33:23)
was fun for me to be like oh I can add (33:21 - 33:26)
these cards to my deck or (33:23 - 33:27)
um (33:26 - 33:28)
there were formats where I was like oh (33:27 - 33:30)
I'm not like super into like this format (33:28 - 33:32)
so I'm okay with taking a break and then (33:30 - 33:34)
like you know those certain cards rotate (33:32 - 33:35)
out and you're like oh those cards are (33:34 - 33:37)
gone I'm coming back in so like there (33:35 - 33:40)
there's like an ebb and flow to that (33:37 - 33:41)
um (33:40 - 33:45)
but I think I think for me it's it's the (33:41 - 33:47)
frustration is (33:45 - 33:49)
um (33:47 - 33:52)
cost is let's say cost wasn't a thing (33:49 - 33:55)
the frustration for me is just like how (33:52 - 33:57)
big these sets are and then like trying (33:55 - 33:59)
to put them together in binder binders (33:57 - 34:01)
and then like sorting through just like (33:59 - 34:03)
hundreds of cards and then being like (34:01 - 34:05)
what am I going to do with these extra (34:03 - 34:07)
cards it's it almost feels like if you (34:05 - 34:08)
want (34:07 - 34:10)
to complete (34:08 - 34:13)
these sets it almost feels like a (34:10 - 34:15)
full-time job like I can't do anything (34:13 - 34:18)
else Pokemon related because the TCG (34:15 - 34:22)
itself is like 90 organization and then (34:18 - 34:25)
like 10 percent (34:22 - 34:30)
well that's what so what I was only I (34:25 - 34:31)
wasn't collecting for a bunch of years I (34:30 - 34:32)
was collecting when I was a kid and then (34:31 - 34:35)
I started again and then I was happy you (34:32 - 34:37)
know I was happy with life and then (34:35 - 34:40)
Steve kept talking about the TCG and (34:37 - 34:43)
talking about you know opening cards and (34:40 - 34:45)
things and I was like you know why don't (34:43 - 34:47)
I just dip in and just you know buy some (34:45 - 34:51)
packs and see if I pull a Charizard or (34:47 - 34:53)
something and now I have a binder for (34:51 - 34:55)
every set and that thing behind me right (34:53 - 34:58)
here is full of those boxes that Greg (34:55 - 35:00)
was just talking about and I've got (34:58 - 35:02)
cards in every room of the house my kids (35:00 - 35:05)
have cards everybody's got cards (35:02 - 35:08)
people do send me cute things oh wow (35:05 - 35:10)
nice and I like having cute things well (35:08 - 35:12)
there you go but like I don't want to (35:10 - 35:14)
but it's I don't want to play the game (35:12 - 35:16)
I'll have the cute things like give me (35:14 - 35:18)
the cute things yes I tried to get back (35:16 - 35:21)
in the game too but I it's it's it's (35:18 - 35:23)
been tough for the audio people I'm (35:21 - 35:25)
holding a special delivery Charizard see (35:23 - 35:27)
so I have like two special delivery (35:25 - 35:28)
Charizards on my desk right they're in (35:27 - 35:32)
the the cellophane wrapper nice and I (35:28 - 35:33)
don't want to take them out of the (35:32 - 35:35)
cellophane (35:33 - 35:37)
but they're not in a binder but I feel (35:35 - 35:39)
like they should be in a binder but I (35:37 - 35:40)
don't know where the binder to put them (35:39 - 35:44)
I guess I put them in seven this is (35:40 - 35:46)
promo 75 apparently (35:44 - 35:49)
yeah I I don't know where that binder is (35:46 - 35:52)
right now somewhere (35:49 - 35:52)
I mean I have so like I have this drawer (35:54 - 35:59)
in the Next Room over and like now what (35:56 - 36:00)
happens is every time a set comes out I (35:59 - 36:03)
just buy a binder and then I try to just (36:00 - 36:06)
organize this like I open you know I I (36:03 - 36:08)
don't know how other people collect I (36:06 - 36:09)
typically buy more stuff at the (36:08 - 36:11)
beginning of the set coming out yeah to (36:09 - 36:13)
open and then try to like get everything (36:11 - 36:15)
filled at that point use like an uh an (36:13 - 36:17)
app on my phone to kind of organize (36:15 - 36:21)
everything and then um and then after a (36:17 - 36:22)
little while then I'm like buying more (36:21 - 36:24)
random stuff buying older stuff and then (36:22 - 36:25)
what happens is the thing like (36:24 - 36:29)
everything starts to pile up and then um (36:25 - 36:33)
I have crossed the age and patience (36:29 - 36:37)
barrier where it is why do I have all of (36:33 - 36:40)
this this stopped being interesting (36:37 - 36:43)
years ago nobody cares about it except (36:40 - 36:47)
for me and my interest is waning why do (36:43 - 36:49)
I want more like that's sort of the (36:47 - 36:51)
weird thing about collecting is at some (36:49 - 36:52)
point (36:51 - 36:55)
my brain just went (36:52 - 36:58)
I don't want to move this into another (36:55 - 37:00)
room I just want to move it to the trash (36:58 - 37:03)
and never have to deal with it again (37:00 - 37:07)
well I I can't I have so much bulk but I (37:03 - 37:10)
can't get rid of it because I haven't (37:07 - 37:12)
finished sorting it (37:10 - 37:14)
and like I know there are a bunch of (37:12 - 37:17)
rares in that bulk that need to go into (37:14 - 37:19)
their respective places in the folder (37:17 - 37:22)
but I haven't done that organization yet (37:19 - 37:25)
so therefore the bulk has to sit do you (37:22 - 37:27)
yeah you got to do it right away with (37:25 - 37:29)
the set because what I do now is like I (37:27 - 37:31)
buy packs like last night I bought some (37:29 - 37:33)
packs and I pretty much have all the (37:31 - 37:36)
comments and the uncommons from the like (37:33 - 37:38)
newest set right it's the rares and the (37:36 - 37:39)
ultra rares and all that stuff that I'm (37:38 - 37:41)
missing so I'll usually go through them (37:39 - 37:43)
and then at the end of like opening a (37:41 - 37:44)
bunch of packs I just take all the (37:43 - 37:46)
uncommons and Commons and either just (37:44 - 37:49)
toss them in a box or like give them to (37:46 - 37:50)
my kids or something and then I just (37:49 - 37:52)
have like the rares and then there's (37:50 - 37:53)
only like (37:52 - 37:55)
20 cards to worry about instead of like (37:53 - 37:57)
200 cards to worry about you know but (37:55 - 37:59)
you have to get to that place where like (37:57 - 38:02)
you get that all organized first and (37:59 - 38:04)
then you can you know then it's a little (38:02 - 38:06)
bit easier to like and enjoy (38:04 - 38:10)
organization which is (38:06 - 38:13)
not me (38:10 - 38:16)
uh okay well let's uh organize ourselves (38:13 - 38:17)
into a break (38:16 - 38:20)
uh and when we come back we will talk (38:17 - 38:22)
about some scarlet and violet events and (38:20 - 38:27)
upcoming news so we will be right back (38:22 - 38:31)
and we are back from our break uh let's (38:27 - 38:34)
let's talk about some scarlet and violet (38:31 - 38:37)
so there was the announcement we I think (38:34 - 38:39)
I think I said this last week that Sarah (38:37 - 38:41)
B said there was some announcement (38:39 - 38:42)
coming (38:41 - 38:46)
there was it was the 1008 video yep (38:42 - 38:48)
although I would say we'll talk about (38:46 - 38:50)
that video in a second there were (38:48 - 38:51)
announcements that came after that video (38:50 - 38:54)
I will say that 1008 video very good I (38:51 - 38:57)
put my reaction I watched it fresh put (38:54 - 38:58)
it up on YouTube (38:57 - 39:00)
I thought it was really great we'll (38:58 - 39:01)
Circle back to that I would say though (39:00 - 39:03)
that that was not worth waking up at six (39:01 - 39:07)
a.m for and I did not wake up at 6am I (39:03 - 39:09)
didn't either I woke up I remember I was (39:07 - 39:11)
at work for a couple of hours then I (39:09 - 39:13)
went oh yeah there's a video (39:11 - 39:15)
I should maybe watch that and then I (39:13 - 39:18)
angered everybody on the internet (39:15 - 39:20)
well because because you don't like (39:18 - 39:23)
golden go correct (39:20 - 39:27)
yeah I mean it's fine it's fine (39:23 - 39:30)
it is fine how did that feel that that (39:27 - 39:33)
was fine though so uh so some of the the (39:30 - 39:35)
announcements that came from that was (39:33 - 39:38)
that there's a Valentine's Day event (39:35 - 39:41)
um which will feature tandemouse not (39:38 - 39:45)
Mouse hold uh they did not say how hard (39:41 - 39:48)
this will be although it is tandemous it (39:45 - 39:50)
is not Mouse hold so I can't imagine it (39:48 - 39:52)
would be a seven star or a six star raid (39:50 - 39:54)
I mean this is gonna be like the one to (39:52 - 39:56)
five star thing right yes yeah this has (39:54 - 39:59)
to be like Delhi Bird yeah uh they did (39:56 - 40:02)
say it will focus on fairy type (39:59 - 40:03)
um where the deli bird was technically (40:02 - 40:04)
everything (40:03 - 40:06)
so (40:04 - 40:07)
I (40:06 - 40:09)
I don't want to say I'm speculating it (40:07 - 40:10)
would be very cool if this was like (40:09 - 40:13)
their first shiny event because again it (40:10 - 40:15)
is it is not Mouse hold (40:13 - 40:18)
um and we do know that you in order to (40:15 - 40:21)
get the family of three it's a one in a (40:18 - 40:24)
hundred chance otherwise it's a 99 in (40:21 - 40:26)
100 chance of getting a family of four (40:24 - 40:28)
now before anyone says well I see family (40:26 - 40:30)
of three all the time family of three (40:28 - 40:34)
does exist in raids you can find a (40:30 - 40:37)
family of three in raids naturally it's (40:34 - 40:40)
just when you evolve tandemouse there's (40:37 - 40:42)
a one in a hundred chance of it becoming (40:40 - 40:45)
a family of three (40:42 - 40:46)
um (40:45 - 40:49)
so maybe that's the case here (40:46 - 40:50)
um I don't want to give anyone's hopes (40:49 - 40:52)
up it could just be like the deli bird (40:50 - 40:53)
event you just get fairy shards nothing (40:52 - 40:57)
big deal but if they were to do a shiny (40:53 - 40:59)
um it'd be it's funny because this would (40:57 - 41:02)
be a very bad shiny to do in raids (40:59 - 41:03)
because you probably wouldn't be able to (41:02 - 41:06)
see the colors of it yeah because of the (41:03 - 41:07)
lens flare in right so you wouldn't (41:06 - 41:09)
actually know until after you caught it (41:07 - 41:11)
whether it be shy (41:09 - 41:14)
but they haven't done anything but yeah (41:11 - 41:16)
in raids doesn't it do the sparkle one (41:14 - 41:18)
that at first (41:16 - 41:20)
it doesn't Sparkle I didn't know that it (41:18 - 41:22)
doesn't Sparkle and rage when it's sunny (41:20 - 41:25)
from the from the two like videos I've (41:22 - 41:26)
seen on Twitter it does not Sparkle in (41:25 - 41:30)
raids uh it you do see it in raids (41:26 - 41:32)
though right you see it as a shiny it (41:30 - 41:33)
has shiny it's just but not really a (41:32 - 41:35)
tandem Mouse it'd be very hard it's (41:33 - 41:36)
already hard to tell without like (41:35 - 41:39)
crystallization over it right right but (41:36 - 41:41)
does so this goes back to just like (41:39 - 41:43)
shinies and raids at all does everyone (41:41 - 41:46)
see it as shiny is it like that raid is (41:43 - 41:51)
shiny like it was yeah everyone (41:46 - 41:53)
um you do you would see it as shiny in (41:51 - 41:54)
the raid (41:53 - 41:55)
um (41:54 - 41:57)
I heard it doesn't Sparkle but I don't (41:55 - 41:59)
know maybe YouTube comments will correct (41:57 - 42:01)
me I do know that shiny charm doesn't (41:59 - 42:02)
work (42:01 - 42:06)
um so it is one in 4096 for for raids (42:02 - 42:08)
um ideally I guess like if you went into (42:06 - 42:10)
a raid you saw it with shiny (42:08 - 42:13)
you could back out invite your friends (42:10 - 42:16)
catch rate is 100 for everyone (42:13 - 42:16)
um (42:16 - 42:21)
but yeah if I I have not seen a shiny (42:17 - 42:23)
raid personally so I I guess I can only (42:21 - 42:25)
give my I've seen this video on Twitter (42:23 - 42:27)
maybe it was fake yeah I don't know yeah (42:25 - 42:29)
I found a shiny in a raid let me know if (42:27 - 42:31)
it Sparkles or not (42:29 - 42:32)
I have an important (42:31 - 42:35)
question (42:32 - 42:38)
why doesn't every Mouse get a hat (42:35 - 42:39)
that's a good question (42:38 - 42:42)
it bothers me it bothers me that every (42:39 - 42:43)
Mouse doesn't have a hat that only one (42:42 - 42:45)
person gets a hat that is that is (42:43 - 42:47)
difficult for me to get past right now (42:45 - 42:49)
Greg with the hard-hitting questions of (42:47 - 42:52)
the day (42:49 - 42:52)
competitive (42:53 - 42:56)
it was like one of those Grassroots (42:54 - 42:58)
battles so like not official like ladder (42:56 - 43:00)
stuff right it was just like a (42:58 - 43:02)
tournament and somebody had a Sandy (43:00 - 43:05)
shocks and they fairy typed their Sandy (43:02 - 43:08)
shocks and the hat was spinning in a (43:05 - 43:09)
circle (43:08 - 43:11)
um the Sandy shark's head and I couldn't (43:09 - 43:14)
tell if I have no clue if that's (43:11 - 43:15)
supposed to be intentional or not (43:14 - 43:18)
because of Sandy shocks I was like I (43:15 - 43:20)
don't know Santa tracks is a wild (43:18 - 43:22)
Pokemon maybe the hat does rotate I've (43:20 - 43:25)
never seen Sandy Shuck's trash less I (43:22 - 43:26)
couldn't tell if it was a glitch or if (43:25 - 43:28)
it was the game or if it was supposed to (43:26 - 43:30)
happen or specifically with Sandy shocks (43:28 - 43:32)
the heart just spins in a circle on his (43:30 - 43:36)
head timeline so much I'm very into this (43:32 - 43:39)
this game is incredibly broken (43:36 - 43:42)
laughs (43:39 - 43:42)
there are people that come into my (43:43 - 43:48)
twitch streams and they're like why do (43:45 - 43:49)
you guys say this game's so buggy I've (43:48 - 43:53)
never experienced a bug and I'm like (43:49 - 43:56)
different definitions of what bugs are (43:53 - 43:58)
yeah this is holy cow like it's like (43:56 - 44:00)
every 10 minutes something wild is (43:58 - 44:02)
happening in this game where they're (44:00 - 44:03)
like I'm falling through the floor or (44:02 - 44:06)
like Pokemon or hiding in walls or like (44:03 - 44:08)
there's one point in a cinderace raid (44:06 - 44:09)
where I just watched a measurado (44:08 - 44:11)
biaskarata by the way that somebody (44:09 - 44:13)
brought to a cinder x-ray just like (44:11 - 44:15)
double slap in front of cinderes and (44:13 - 44:17)
then cinderace just disappeared from The (44:15 - 44:21)
Raid pedal it was like this (44:17 - 44:24)
this is wild (44:21 - 44:24)
laughs (44:25 - 44:30)
everything about something again I don't (44:27 - 44:32)
know if candy talk says Tara is supposed (44:30 - 44:35)
to have different head spin around him (44:32 - 44:38)
but it was tight it was awesome anyways (44:35 - 44:40)
now he's coming to Reigns the (44:38 - 44:43)
interesting thing about this is it's (44:40 - 44:45)
starting on a Monday and it's ending on (44:43 - 44:46)
like a Thursday (44:45 - 44:49)
so normally The Raid events are (44:46 - 44:51)
um like Thursday to Sunday but this one (44:49 - 44:53)
is starting when a different rate is (44:51 - 44:56)
ending and then it does go over (44:53 - 44:58)
Valentine's Day so that makes sense (44:56 - 44:59)
um (44:58 - 45:01)
everybody have to catch one for me (44:59 - 45:03)
because I will not I will not be playing (45:01 - 45:06)
this game during this time period (45:03 - 45:08)
um yeah I I don't know if it's great or (45:06 - 45:11)
not my camera's freaking out I'm sorry I (45:08 - 45:12)
got (45:11 - 45:13)
this is not good (45:12 - 45:15)
just one second just fix that camera (45:13 - 45:18)
yeah all right Bobby's fixing this (45:15 - 45:20)
camera for YouTube (45:18 - 45:21)
um (45:20 - 45:24)
the next bit of news here is they (45:21 - 45:27)
announced another set of raids that they (45:24 - 45:29)
they said the next seven star raid is (45:27 - 45:31)
coming (45:29 - 45:33)
um which is a little bit earlier than (45:31 - 45:34)
expected I thought they were going to do (45:33 - 45:37)
one seven star raid per month but this (45:34 - 45:39)
one is sneaking into January (45:37 - 45:41)
um so I don't know maybe it's one seven (45:39 - 45:43)
star raid every (45:41 - 45:47)
four weeks exactly no matter what (45:43 - 45:49)
uh I don't know what I don't know what (45:47 - 45:51)
the schedule is but they didn't reveal (45:49 - 45:52)
what the Pokemon was they just said it (45:51 - 45:55)
will be a seven star poison type Terror (45:52 - 45:59)
raid and it will go from January 27th to (45:55 - 46:02)
January 29th and then it will return on (45:59 - 46:05)
February 10th through February 12th (46:02 - 46:08)
um so I will have the mightiest mark it (46:05 - 46:10)
will be Seven Stars if you didn't know (46:08 - 46:12)
this by now seven star raid Pokemon our (46:10 - 46:13)
level 100 (46:12 - 46:16)
um don't bring your level 75 Gengar to (46:13 - 46:19)
ascend race please it it it it will not (46:16 - 46:24)
survive I have visual proof If a kangar (46:19 - 46:26)
is the best (46:24 - 46:29)
um so there there is speculation here of (46:26 - 46:31)
what it could be (46:29 - 46:33)
um not to go too deep into things but (46:31 - 46:35)
just like in sword and shield I think (46:33 - 46:36)
we've talked about this before just like (46:35 - 46:37)
in sword and shield there were some (46:36 - 46:39)
Pokemon in sword and shield in the game (46:37 - 46:42)
code like Mel metal that were not (46:39 - 46:44)
available until a certain point in the (46:42 - 46:45)
game Snorlax is another good example (46:44 - 46:48)
right gigantomax Snorlax was in the game (46:45 - 46:51)
code for about a month but you couldn't (46:48 - 46:54)
get it until they they said you could (46:51 - 46:56)
um we Charizard was in the game code (46:54 - 46:59)
before scarlet and violet released but (46:56 - 47:01)
you couldn't get Charizard until (46:59 - 47:04)
the The Raid event so (47:01 - 47:08)
we do know that Blastoise and Venusaur (47:04 - 47:10)
are nowhere to be found they're not in (47:08 - 47:11)
the game code Charizard is this was (47:10 - 47:14)
exactly the same for sword and shield (47:11 - 47:15)
um that being said it could be exactly (47:14 - 47:16)
the same for sword and shield where (47:15 - 47:18)
Blastoise and Venusaur show up for (47:16 - 47:20)
future DLC right I don't think they're (47:18 - 47:23)
going to be forgotten or left behind (47:20 - 47:25)
um starter-wise (47:23 - 47:28)
that the Gen 8 starters are in the game (47:25 - 47:32)
code cinderace rilla boom in Italian are (47:28 - 47:34)
in the game code we all we obviously (47:32 - 47:36)
just got sent a race we know the hisuian (47:34 - 47:38)
starters are in the game code this makes (47:36 - 47:40)
the most sense because obviously they (47:38 - 47:42)
would want you to use his sui and (47:40 - 47:44)
Typhlosion (47:42 - 47:48)
decidueye and then hisuian Samurai (47:44 - 47:50)
in those games (47:48 - 47:52)
um and then the other set of starters (47:50 - 47:55)
that are in the game code are the Gen 6 (47:52 - 47:57)
starters so that would be Greninja Del (47:55 - 48:01)
Fox and the Abomination that is just not (47:57 - 48:03)
um (48:01 - 48:06)
so if if we're going thematically uh (48:03 - 48:08)
which we have two Pokemon whether that's (48:06 - 48:10)
a pattern or not who knows but (48:08 - 48:13)
thematically yeah (48:10 - 48:15)
it can't be a pattern two it cannot be a (48:13 - 48:17)
pattern yeah it can't be a pattern (48:15 - 48:19)
thematically Charizard being a dragon (48:17 - 48:22)
type makes sense right like (48:19 - 48:24)
I I don't think anyone would be like wow (48:22 - 48:26)
why would they make Charizard a dragon (48:24 - 48:28)
type Tara like I think everyone's in (48:26 - 48:30)
agreement that that made sense (48:28 - 48:33)
being a fire fighting I think makes (48:30 - 48:36)
sense if you look at like the history of (48:33 - 48:37)
Pokemon fans complaining about (48:36 - 48:39)
firefighting right like there was I mean (48:37 - 48:41)
there are so many worries that cine race (48:39 - 48:43)
was going to be firefighting just (48:41 - 48:45)
looking at him (48:43 - 48:47)
um it also leans into the soccer (48:45 - 48:49)
hooligan and I'm looking at you UK you (48:47 - 48:51)
know you're a bunch of hooligans and you (48:49 - 48:52)
beat people up when soccer games happen (48:51 - 48:54)
so (48:52 - 48:56)
so I think I think if we just go (48:54 - 48:59)
thematically here of a poison type Terra (48:56 - 49:02)
Greninja does fit thematically because (48:59 - 49:04)
ninjas poison (49:02 - 49:06)
um don't despise it could be in Italian (49:04 - 49:09)
it could be Italian that's right uh it (49:06 - 49:11)
could also just be his sui and (49:09 - 49:12)
Typhlosion right there are no rules yeah (49:11 - 49:14)
there's no rules (49:12 - 49:16)
it'd be Delphox it doesn't actually (49:14 - 49:18)
um so thematically though I think (49:16 - 49:20)
Greninja makes the most sense (49:18 - 49:20)
um (49:20 - 49:24)
on a technical level competitively or I (49:20 - 49:25)
don't know I don't know what to call it (49:24 - 49:27)
like in a raid like strategically it (49:25 - 49:29)
makes the most sense because (49:27 - 49:33)
poison is weak to psychic Greninja (49:29 - 49:35)
counters that by naturally being a dark (49:33 - 49:38)
type poison is also weak to ground (49:35 - 49:40)
Greninja counters that naturally to (49:38 - 49:45)
being a water type so I think that does (49:40 - 49:48)
both thematically and strategically both (49:45 - 49:50)
make sense now again it could just be (49:48 - 49:52)
tissuing Typhlosion it could be it could (49:50 - 49:55)
be Hisui and Samurai like who who knows (49:52 - 49:56)
who knows (49:55 - 49:58)
um I guess technically if it was his (49:56 - 50:01)
suing Samurai I think for the most part (49:58 - 50:03)
the same counters were correct because (50:01 - 50:07)
they're both hot or dark (50:03 - 50:07)
uh but who knows I mean I mean by maybe (50:07 - 50:12)
by the time this podcast goes up we know (50:10 - 50:14)
exactly what that will be (50:12 - 50:16)
um I I will build raid counters you know (50:14 - 50:18)
based off that (50:16 - 50:20)
um if it if it is (50:18 - 50:22)
you know Greninja we would at least know (50:20 - 50:24)
for sure would have water shuriken right (50:22 - 50:25)
there's no way they would ever release (50:24 - 50:27)
like like the same reason they would (50:25 - 50:29)
never really generates without pyro ball (50:27 - 50:31)
they're never gonna release Greninja (50:29 - 50:32)
without water shuriken that's a (50:31 - 50:35)
signature move (50:32 - 50:35)
um Greninja can be a mixed attacker (50:36 - 50:40)
though (50:39 - 50:42)
um which is interesting because I think (50:40 - 50:44)
light screen and reflect are pretty uh (50:42 - 50:46)
important to raids unless your name is (50:44 - 50:48)
celebro and you're just very selfish and (50:46 - 50:49)
you just iron defend yourself and ignore (50:48 - 50:54)
you I need nobody but me (50:49 - 50:59)
let them cook uh but (50:54 - 51:03)
uh Greninja does no brick break so I (50:59 - 51:04)
don't know if that's 800 IQ if they do (51:03 - 51:06)
maker ninja mixed attacker and you set (51:04 - 51:08)
light screen and you start reflect and (51:06 - 51:10)
it knows brick break who knows (51:08 - 51:12)
um I don't think we should be too (51:10 - 51:13)
concerned until we actually finally know (51:12 - 51:15)
what the Pokemon ends up being but (51:13 - 51:19)
correct you know even even if (51:15 - 51:21)
we're surprised by greninja's moveset (51:19 - 51:24)
day one there's the whole weekend plus a (51:21 - 51:27)
whole other weekend after it assuming it (51:24 - 51:31)
is Greninja but I I do kind of like the (51:27 - 51:33)
here's the terror type (51:31 - 51:35)
what do you guys think it is I do think (51:33 - 51:36)
that was like interesting marketing from (51:35 - 51:39)
the Pokemon company I think it's fun (51:36 - 51:39)
are there dates I'm sorry I missed it (51:40 - 51:44)
yeah you were fixing your camera uh (51:42 - 51:48)
January 27th through 29th so (51:44 - 51:49)
oh okay so it isn't oh yeah yeah yeah (51:48 - 51:53)
and then February 10th through 12th (51:49 - 51:55)
um got it (51:53 - 51:58)
so we'll we'll maybe game freak will (51:55 - 52:00)
throw us a curveball would be poison (51:58 - 52:01)
Charizard (52:00 - 52:05)
welcome to poison Charizard (52:01 - 52:08)
very interesting I think the other thing (52:05 - 52:10)
I'm curious and we we don't have enough (52:08 - 52:12)
raid battles under our belt to to know (52:10 - 52:15)
is uh I think Charizard did have Terra (52:12 - 52:16)
Blast but it didn't really matter (52:15 - 52:17)
because Charizard (52:16 - 52:22)
had learns Dragon type moves right and (52:17 - 52:23)
um cinderace didn't have terror blast (52:22 - 52:26)
but Greninja (52:23 - 52:28)
using grinning as an example Greninja (52:26 - 52:29)
Only Knows two poison type moves one is (52:28 - 52:32)
toxic spikes which is completely useless (52:29 - 52:35)
yeah and then the other one is gunshot (52:32 - 52:38)
which is a physical move (52:35 - 52:41)
um but water sugar cane is special (52:38 - 52:43)
so it could take advantage of Terra (52:41 - 52:44)
Blast (52:43 - 52:47)
but I it would be weird for them to I (52:44 - 52:48)
don't think it would be weird it's just (52:47 - 52:51)
interesting that like a lot of five and (52:48 - 52:54)
six star raid Pokemon don't rely on (52:51 - 52:56)
Terra Blast so for example like (52:54 - 52:57)
corvanite (52:56 - 53:00)
um if it's a water type corvinite or a a (52:57 - 53:03)
fire type corvonite or a bug type of (53:00 - 53:04)
Carbonite none of that matters because (53:03 - 53:06)
Corva Knight doesn't learn those moves (53:04 - 53:07)
and it doesn't have Terra Blast it will (53:06 - 53:11)
always no Drill Pack Iron Head bulk up (53:07 - 53:12)
um I think it knows like (53:11 - 53:15)
Tailwind so like when you look at corvo (53:12 - 53:17)
Knight and you're like oh it's fire like (53:15 - 53:18)
you just know it doesn't have a fire (53:17 - 53:21)
type move so I'm curious if when they're (53:18 - 53:23)
picking for seven star (53:21 - 53:27)
raid Pokemon if their natural moveset (53:23 - 53:30)
plays a part of that so again the only (53:27 - 53:33)
one it knows is gunshot but it they (53:30 - 53:34)
could give a terablast to make up for (53:33 - 53:38)
that would toxic spikes go off if you're (53:34 - 53:40)
Pokemon fainted because you are sent (53:38 - 53:44)
back in oh I don't know (53:40 - 53:46)
I don't know that I've ever seen it I (53:44 - 53:48)
would imagine it would go off unless you (53:46 - 53:50)
had something that ate up the toxic (53:48 - 53:53)
spikes yeah I don't know I will say (53:50 - 53:55)
after doing (53:53 - 53:58)
um so I did enough Cinder ice array this (53:55 - 53:59)
is how I can tell how many Cinder ice (53:58 - 54:01)
raids I did I did so many Center Ice (53:59 - 54:03)
raids that I maxed out on fighting tarot (54:01 - 54:07)
shards oh boy whoa uh (54:03 - 54:09)
so I did more Center Ice raids than I (54:07 - 54:11)
did Charizard raids and I did a lot of (54:09 - 54:13)
Charizard raids too (54:11 - 54:17)
like literally I I just all all my shiny (54:13 - 54:18)
Pokemon are level 100 at this point (54:17 - 54:20)
because I just was like I I need to dump (54:18 - 54:24)
these candies into something because you (54:20 - 54:27)
can't have more than 999 large candies (54:24 - 54:29)
or whatever right I think Charizard gave (54:27 - 54:31)
more xl's (54:29 - 54:35)
um then Center is dead but uh I did a (54:31 - 54:36)
lot of cinderase and I I think my two (54:35 - 54:40)
takeaways besides look I could spend an (54:36 - 54:41)
hour complaining about stored power (54:40 - 54:42)
Slowbro (54:41 - 54:46)
um I I don't think I need to uh but (54:42 - 54:48)
I think my two takeaways are I I really (54:46 - 54:51)
don't think leftovers or black sludge (54:48 - 54:55)
are worth it in raids at all and the (54:51 - 54:57)
reason I think that is because every (54:55 - 55:01)
turn the game has to say that leftovers (54:57 - 55:04)
goes off and your clock is still ticking (55:01 - 55:08)
when that happens right and the amount (55:04 - 55:10)
of times where there's only like five to (55:08 - 55:12)
ten seconds left (55:10 - 55:15)
if if like leftovers throughout the (55:12 - 55:18)
entire raid is like a minute of your (55:15 - 55:21)
entire timer just going off and I was (55:18 - 55:23)
calculating like the HP you get back and (55:21 - 55:25)
like I was using a toxipex (55:23 - 55:27)
and I was like I'm only getting like 11 (55:25 - 55:30)
to 15 HP back every turn like this (55:27 - 55:32)
doesn't matter at all like even in two (55:30 - 55:35)
turns it's like 30 like yeah there are (55:32 - 55:36)
some turns where you survive with like (55:35 - 55:38)
one HP of like oh I got but there are (55:36 - 55:40)
also turns where it's like oh I got full (55:38 - 55:41)
health and (55:40 - 55:43)
he cripped me even though he was like (55:41 - 55:45)
before like it didn't really matter here (55:43 - 55:47)
like there's so much RNG it was like (55:45 - 55:51)
does that does having a little bit of (55:47 - 55:54)
extra HP matter yes 100 never not going (55:51 - 55:56)
to debate that does having a little bit (55:54 - 55:58)
of HP to (55:56 - 56:01)
Whittle down your timer because of the (55:58 - 56:03)
message popping up for everyone worth it (56:01 - 56:06)
that's what I don't think is really (56:03 - 56:08)
worth it like there might be like I (56:06 - 56:09)
switched (56:08 - 56:13)
black sludge on toxipex to mirror herb (56:09 - 56:16)
so when cinderase bulks up turn one I (56:13 - 56:19)
get the defense boost turn one and that (56:16 - 56:22)
did a million times better for not only (56:19 - 56:24)
waiting every turn to be like leftovers (56:22 - 56:26)
it says repeat like I just had that like (56:24 - 56:29)
bulkier set right away (56:26 - 56:31)
um obviously he clears it at some point (56:29 - 56:34)
but so yeah the more I do raids the more (56:31 - 56:36)
I'm like (56:34 - 56:38)
yeah I don't think these which is which (56:36 - 56:39)
is totally nice like right like I think (56:38 - 56:41)
there are there are (56:39 - 56:43)
um moves (56:41 - 56:45)
that are so good for raids that you (56:43 - 56:46)
would probably never see in a story (56:45 - 56:48)
playthrough (56:46 - 56:49)
um or you would really never see (56:48 - 56:52)
competitively like you know I've (56:49 - 56:53)
did three years of competitive and sword (56:52 - 56:55)
and shield I don't think I ever saw a (56:53 - 56:57)
Pokemon acid spray once in sword and (56:55 - 57:00)
shield but acid spray is so good in (56:57 - 57:01)
raids (57:00 - 57:03)
um and then (57:01 - 57:05)
uh (57:03 - 57:08)
I think there are there are held items (57:05 - 57:10)
that you see all the time competitively (57:08 - 57:11)
but you would you wouldn't really see in (57:10 - 57:12)
raids and vice versa which I think is (57:11 - 57:14)
great I think that's absolutely (57:12 - 57:16)
fantastic that like you know I had some (57:14 - 57:17)
people ask like oh I love your raid (57:16 - 57:19)
Pokemon that you built on like Instagram (57:17 - 57:21)
can I use these in competitive and I was (57:19 - 57:26)
like oh no no no no no no you could but (57:21 - 57:28)
like no they're they're specifically (57:26 - 57:30)
designed for for raids (57:28 - 57:32)
um the other thing is any move with (57:30 - 57:35)
recoil I think is completely terrible (57:32 - 57:37)
for raids so uh example would be like (57:35 - 57:40)
Brave Bird and the reason that they're (57:37 - 57:42)
bad for raids is because I believe Brave (57:40 - 57:45)
Bird off the top of my head you get one (57:42 - 57:47)
third the damage (57:45 - 57:50)
recoiled back to you so for example if (57:47 - 57:52)
you're doing 300 damage you take a (57:50 - 57:55)
hundred damage and so there would be (57:52 - 57:57)
situations where I would bulk up twice (57:55 - 57:59)
and then they would be weak against (57:57 - 58:02)
flying and then I would Brave Bird and (57:59 - 58:03)
because I was doing so much damage and (58:02 - 58:05)
because the health the boss's health is (58:03 - 58:07)
way past like (58:05 - 58:10)
400 right like the like the boss will (58:07 - 58:11)
have like 10 000 HP or something like (58:10 - 58:13)
that you just can't see it I would do so (58:11 - 58:15)
much damage that I would recoil myself (58:13 - 58:18)
400 damage which means I was probably (58:15 - 58:20)
doing like 1200 damage right and then I (58:18 - 58:23)
would instant kill myself because I was (58:20 - 58:25)
doing so much damage so I think any move (58:23 - 58:27)
with recoil isn't really worth it in (58:25 - 58:28)
raids (58:27 - 58:30)
um and if you're survive if you're (58:28 - 58:32)
surviving your recoil (58:30 - 58:34)
you're probably not doing as much damage (58:32 - 58:37)
as you think of yourself (58:34 - 58:37)
um (58:37 - 58:42)
uh so anyways (58:39 - 58:44)
um (58:42 - 58:44)
I I I like cinderace I do think it was (58:45 - 58:50)
harder than Charizard and I think it was (58:47 - 58:52)
harder because (58:50 - 58:55)
the same reason some six star raids are (58:52 - 58:57)
hard for people they have no way to (58:55 - 58:58)
control (58:57 - 59:01)
the snowball that can happen with bulk (58:58 - 59:05)
up or like a Swords Dance or like um (59:01 - 59:08)
uh some some red Pokemon have Moxie so (59:05 - 59:10)
every time you faint that Pokemon gets (59:08 - 59:12)
stronger because that's how Moxie works (59:10 - 59:14)
so I I there there was a way to control (59:12 - 59:16)
obviously Cinder Aces bulk up you could (59:14 - 59:18)
either taunt it or you could just (59:16 - 59:19)
chilling Waters literally one Pokemon (59:18 - 59:21)
with chilling water completely controls (59:19 - 59:22)
that (59:21 - 59:25)
um but I've noticed in raids where that (59:22 - 59:27)
didn't happen (59:25 - 59:29)
um it was like oh this makes sense like (59:27 - 59:31)
I I totally understand why more people (59:29 - 59:32)
would fail this than that because (59:31 - 59:34)
Charizard didn't have a way to control (59:32 - 59:36)
like Charizard never got stronger or (59:34 - 59:38)
weaker (59:36 - 59:38)
um (59:38 - 59:40)
well I guess technically you could argue (59:38 - 59:41)
you got stronger when the sun was up (59:40 - 59:46)
with yeah a little stronger uh (59:41 - 59:46)
but the the like the bulk up control I (59:46 - 59:51)
think was (59:49 - 59:53)
I I don't think it was bad I think it (59:51 - 59:55)
was like now now people who don't know (59:53 - 59:57)
what book of did I think they now did (59:55 - 59:58)
them now (59:57 - 60:02)
well so I was talking to Greg earlier um (59:58 - 60:05)
I don't have cinderes yet like I've done (60:02 - 60:07)
some cinderase raids with a couple (60:05 - 60:11)
people in slack and I have a slow bro (60:07 - 60:14)
like I have a raid ready slow bro (60:11 - 60:17)
um but we couldn't beat it like it was (60:14 - 60:19)
there was there was three of us and we (60:17 - 60:21)
tried uh we tried like four or five (60:19 - 60:22)
times (60:21 - 60:23)
um I don't know it was like three (60:22 - 60:25)
o'clock in the morning my time yeah (60:23 - 60:28)
there's a rough time yeah (60:25 - 60:30)
um so I don't have it yet so I was (60:28 - 60:31)
thinking like I was like okay I have (60:30 - 60:35)
until uh four o'clock my time today to (60:31 - 60:38)
try to get one but um I think it was (60:35 - 60:40)
definitely harder than uh Charizard but (60:38 - 60:42)
at the same time (60:40 - 60:44)
I don't know we didn't have a perfectly (60:42 - 60:46)
ready team (60:44 - 60:49)
for it like I did I had my slow bro but (60:46 - 60:51)
I I know that there was like and we only (60:49 - 60:53)
had three people as well so we didn't (60:51 - 60:54)
have that we had didn't have that fourth (60:53 - 60:57)
person in there helping out but it's (60:54 - 60:57)
definitely I think it was definitely (60:57 - 61:01)
harder than Charizard for sure (60:57 - 61:01)
like wild to me that the whole reason (61:02 - 61:06)
this is the one thing I will say about (61:04 - 61:08)
this stored power slow bro it's still (61:06 - 61:09)
wild to me that the whole reason the (61:08 - 61:13)
stored power slow bro became like (61:09 - 61:17)
ideally became popular is because people (61:13 - 61:18)
didn't want to play online with other (61:17 - 61:21)
people and so the whole point of the (61:18 - 61:23)
stored power Slowbro was like I hate (61:21 - 61:25)
playing online with other people because (61:23 - 61:27)
they don't know what they're doing so (61:25 - 61:29)
with this Slowbro build of iron defense (61:27 - 61:33)
and stored power I can do it myself with (61:29 - 61:36)
NPCs that was the entire point of why it (61:33 - 61:37)
existed (61:36 - 61:40)
but I like I said I have maxed out my (61:37 - 61:43)
fighting Tara I have done so many (61:40 - 61:47)
cinderes and when I was I I did this new (61:43 - 61:48)
like thing on Twitch where I was like (61:47 - 61:50)
let's go into random raids because I (61:48 - 61:51)
helped everyone in my twitch channel (61:50 - 61:53)
right I was like okay who who doesn't (61:51 - 61:54)
have a cinder it's cool we got Cinder is (61:53 - 61:56)
great great you got Cinder race you got (61:54 - 61:58)
send race great cool I want to see what (61:56 - 61:59)
people are using online because you guys (61:58 - 62:00)
are all using great stuff you're all (61:59 - 62:03)
using armor rouges and slowbros like (62:00 - 62:04)
slowbros and toxic packs and like (62:03 - 62:07)
whatever was uh recommended (62:04 - 62:08)
um (62:07 - 62:13)
and there was never a single Slowbro in (62:08 - 62:15)
the countless amounts of like let's just (62:13 - 62:17)
jump online okay Azuma roll iron hands (62:15 - 62:19)
like the iron like the things you would (62:17 - 62:21)
see like I don't think sylvian's a good (62:19 - 62:22)
choice but we'll see if yours will be on (62:21 - 62:24)
no I can't (62:22 - 62:26)
um there wasn't a single Slowbro that (62:24 - 62:27)
didn't (62:26 - 62:30)
iron defense turn one iron defense turn (62:27 - 62:33)
two now like and it's just like this is (62:30 - 62:35)
so crazy to me because the whole point (62:33 - 62:37)
of the slow Pro was so you didn't do it (62:35 - 62:40)
online because people were complaining (62:37 - 62:42)
that no one online knew what they were (62:40 - 62:43)
doing (62:42 - 62:45)
so why are you here I don't understand (62:43 - 62:48)
why why are you here I mean what that (62:45 - 62:50)
that's the thing of a person looking up (62:48 - 62:51)
a build (62:50 - 62:54)
finding a build but not reading (62:51 - 62:57)
anything around it right yeah no context (62:54 - 63:00)
just to find a lot of people just look (62:57 - 63:02)
at builds online and don't read the (63:00 - 63:05)
context like how you should use this (63:02 - 63:07)
like oh I know how to play Pokemon I (63:05 - 63:09)
just need a good move set done out done (63:07 - 63:12)
and dusted I got it it'll be great (63:09 - 63:15)
that was like my Jonathan example last (63:12 - 63:17)
week when I was like oh the this person (63:15 - 63:19)
named Jonathan joined my RAID and I was (63:17 - 63:20)
streaming on Twitch so the only way they (63:19 - 63:22)
could have joined my RAID was by (63:20 - 63:23)
watching my stream because the code (63:22 - 63:25)
would have been on the stream in real (63:23 - 63:26)
time (63:25 - 63:28)
and then they were using the armorers I (63:26 - 63:30)
built but they weren't using the other (63:28 - 63:31)
three moves they were just using (63:30 - 63:34)
expanding Force like they like yeah yeah (63:31 - 63:38)
like you got the build right but you're (63:34 - 63:39)
just spamming the attack when it was (63:38 - 63:41)
like oh no expanding forces like use (63:39 - 63:43)
that like like turn four or five like (63:41 - 63:45)
you use that after you use the other (63:43 - 63:50)
three moves but the armor Rouge has (63:45 - 63:52)
um so yeah that was like it was just (63:50 - 63:55)
show like I couldn't help but like laugh (63:52 - 63:59)
every raid of like oh you just you're (63:55 - 64:01)
just hitting the like the things you (63:59 - 64:04)
were told to hit and like uh you cannot (64:01 - 64:07)
stray from that stray like like no (64:04 - 64:08)
cheers for anyone else like doesn't (64:07 - 64:10)
matter if everyone else is dying I'm (64:08 - 64:12)
gonna hit I'm never gonna help anyone (64:10 - 64:14)
else I'm just gonna hit the moves that (64:12 - 64:17)
like I was told to hit and then it (64:14 - 64:18)
doesn't work (64:17 - 64:20)
I don't know it's just wild to me like (64:18 - 64:22)
the psychology of like (64:20 - 64:24)
what are you what's going through your (64:22 - 64:27)
mind right now well yeah I I mean yes (64:24 - 64:30)
absolutely but if you don't want it to (64:27 - 64:31)
be a team-based game then why are you (64:30 - 64:34)
why are you here you're like you can do (64:31 - 64:36)
this fine offline like it works the (64:34 - 64:38)
whole point is to work offline right (64:36 - 64:41)
right although like for for me like I (64:38 - 64:43)
don't have seven star rates so like I (64:41 - 64:45)
don't have I haven't done all the things (64:43 - 64:47)
post game to get the Seven Star raids to (64:45 - 64:49)
show up so I can see like I can see (64:47 - 64:51)
people who are like I want to get a (64:49 - 64:55)
cinder Ace I'm gonna join a raid and I'm (64:51 - 64:57)
gonna win and I'm gonna spam a move (64:55 - 65:01)
because in the normal game I just Spam a (64:57 - 65:03)
move right like I just Spam a move and (65:01 - 65:05)
we win right and like not understanding (65:03 - 65:08)
that these raids I mean this is the (65:05 - 65:10)
first game ever where you actually have (65:08 - 65:12)
to have a decent amount of strategy it's (65:10 - 65:14)
only the second game that has raids but (65:12 - 65:16)
it's the you know first one ever where (65:14 - 65:17)
there has to be a decent amount of (65:16 - 65:20)
strategy in what you're doing during (65:17 - 65:22)
these rates for these Seven Star ones (65:20 - 65:24)
specifically and maybe in the six star (65:22 - 65:26)
ones as well but (65:24 - 65:28)
um so I can see p I can definitely see (65:26 - 65:30)
people who have only played Pokemon one (65:28 - 65:33)
way for however long and are like well (65:30 - 65:34)
I'll just do this in the raids right (65:33 - 65:36)
like seven star raids and uh you know (65:34 - 65:38)
here's a build that I found online and (65:36 - 65:39)
no here's here's a streamer who he's (65:38 - 65:41)
been winning all these raids or he knows (65:39 - 65:42)
how to win these raids (65:41 - 65:44)
um they'll carry me I'm just gonna this (65:42 - 65:47)
is you know spam this thing and uh and (65:44 - 65:50)
clearly that does not work in uh yes I (65:47 - 65:52)
feel like (65:50 - 65:54)
again I've done a lot of raids I and I I (65:52 - 65:57)
feel like if I see somebody come in and (65:54 - 65:59)
the first thing they do is just Spam an (65:57 - 66:01)
attack (65:59 - 66:02)
that tells me that they they don't (66:01 - 66:04)
understand the mechanics yeah because (66:02 - 66:06)
there's zero reason why you should ever (66:04 - 66:08)
go into a raid and just be like high (66:06 - 66:11)
horsepower like if anything you should (66:08 - 66:12)
hit attack boost and then hit High (66:11 - 66:14)
horsepower because your high horsepower (66:12 - 66:15)
is going to do more damage but also (66:14 - 66:17)
everyone sitting next to you their High (66:15 - 66:18)
horsepowers are going to do more damage (66:17 - 66:20)
right like there's no reason to ever hit (66:18 - 66:24)
an attack turn one unless that attack is (66:20 - 66:25)
something like acid spray where it's (66:24 - 66:28)
lowering the special defense of (66:25 - 66:30)
cinderase so that like that tells me (66:28 - 66:34)
right away what's happening I also (66:30 - 66:37)
uh you know I like I teased Greg on (66:34 - 66:39)
stream like last night because I was (66:37 - 66:41)
like oh like Greg was like oh I think (66:39 - 66:43)
people are succeeding these raids but (66:41 - 66:45)
the amount of people or I think Rick (66:43 - 66:46)
said something like I think more people (66:45 - 66:48)
are succeeding than failing but the (66:46 - 66:51)
amount of people that I've just like I I (66:48 - 66:52)
see them get one shot in the raid and (66:51 - 66:53)
then I go over I don't know if you guys (66:52 - 66:54)
know this but you can like go over and (66:53 - 66:56)
like click on their Pokemon and you can (66:54 - 66:58)
see what level they are but you can't (66:56 - 67:00)
see that before the ride starts you have (66:58 - 67:02)
to be in the raid and then you have to (67:00 - 67:04)
like fight the menu of like locking up (67:02 - 67:06)
before it like so I would like click on (67:04 - 67:09)
this Pokemon and be like you're 75 (67:06 - 67:11)
you're 80. you're you're 60. you're (67:09 - 67:14)
you're you're you're 97 why are you 97 (67:11 - 67:15)
you don't have three rare candies like (67:14 - 67:18)
it's just like the amount of people that (67:15 - 67:21)
were just and I I don't want to put the (67:18 - 67:23)
complete blame on them because nowhere (67:21 - 67:25)
does it tell you Cinder is level (67:23 - 67:28)
although you could easily look it up (67:25 - 67:30)
um and again you know a lot of these (67:28 - 67:31)
players probably went through this story (67:30 - 67:33)
and was like this was relatively easy (67:31 - 67:35)
you know ideally you know most (67:33 - 67:37)
Pokemon games are easy because they just (67:35 - 67:38)
want you to get to credits so you can (67:37 - 67:39)
unlock everything (67:38 - 67:42)
but like I just think about this one (67:39 - 67:44)
like the Gengar for example like it was (67:42 - 67:46)
like a level 75 Gengar it was the (67:44 - 67:47)
standard move set because I could look (67:46 - 67:49)
at all of it and it was like oh you just (67:47 - 67:52)
did a promoted Gengar raid you caught it (67:49 - 67:54)
because it's level 75 when you catch it (67:52 - 67:56)
it has all the moves and then you you (67:54 - 67:58)
didn't EV train it you didn't IV train (67:56 - 68:00)
it although it probably has decent IVs (67:58 - 68:01)
you didn't put a health item on it and (68:00 - 68:03)
now you brought it here and now it's (68:01 - 68:04)
getting one shot I literally used (68:03 - 68:07)
chilling water six times on cinderase he (68:04 - 68:09)
was negative six attack (68:07 - 68:12)
he was still one-shotting back in car (68:09 - 68:16)
and I just thought like you Mr Gengar (68:12 - 68:20)
player you will any raid you join you (68:16 - 68:22)
are instantly losing it for the three (68:20 - 68:24)
other people and it's because the game (68:22 - 68:26)
has no communication of like (68:24 - 68:29)
even even if it showed the levels before (68:26 - 68:31)
you joined I think that would be so (68:29 - 68:33)
helpful yeah because it would alert the (68:31 - 68:35)
other players like oh I'm backing out (68:33 - 68:38)
because we can't win we literally can't (68:35 - 68:40)
with the level 75 Gengar I mean maybe (68:38 - 68:43)
some maybe like three very coordinated (68:40 - 68:47)
people could carry that level 75 Gengar (68:43 - 68:49)
I'm sure but not three random people not (68:47 - 68:53)
even knowing that the Gengar is 75 until (68:49 - 68:55)
after the battle has already started and (68:53 - 68:56)
after the battle started it's like oh (68:55 - 68:59)
we're done for it it's too late it's too (68:56 - 69:01)
late and I don't want to hear the (68:59 - 69:03)
argument I saw this last week on like (69:01 - 69:05)
one of the YouTube comments of like oh (69:03 - 69:07)
it's just a bunch of kids I I do not (69:05 - 69:09)
want to hear that argument there are so (69:07 - 69:11)
many tear and again but Greg can agree (69:09 - 69:13)
with me 100 because he's played Final (69:11 - 69:15)
Fantasy which is more of an adult based (69:13 - 69:17)
game than Pokemon I will say this I will (69:15 - 69:21)
say like an MMO is normally more an (69:17 - 69:23)
older audience because it requires a (69:21 - 69:26)
monthly subscription and the topics are (69:23 - 69:29)
are definitely 13 plus (69:26 - 69:33)
um but hey so Greg playing Final Fantasy (69:29 - 69:35)
14 me playing Destiny there are so many (69:33 - 69:38)
adults that are just dog water at video (69:35 - 69:39)
games and that's fine it's okay to be (69:38 - 69:41)
bad at video games but it's it's the (69:39 - 69:44)
people that like don't listen to like (69:41 - 69:46)
feedback like if I'm in a destiny rate (69:44 - 69:47)
and somebody keeps dying over and over (69:46 - 69:50)
and I'm like hey man like maybe try a (69:47 - 69:52)
different gun or hey maybe you should (69:50 - 69:54)
like do this first and they're like no (69:52 - 69:56)
no I'm good and it's like are you (69:54 - 69:57)
because you've died more than everyone (69:56 - 69:59)
else and we're gonna sit here for (69:57 - 70:00)
another two hours unless you just make (69:59 - 70:04)
this small minor tweak like hear me out (70:00 - 70:08)
man that's a break first like (70:04 - 70:10)
well that's what I was gonna say like I (70:08 - 70:13)
think kids are actually more likely to (70:10 - 70:16)
try to figure out how to win the raid (70:13 - 70:19)
than adults are like (70:16 - 70:23)
in in a way of I feel like there are a (70:19 - 70:24)
lot of (70:23 - 70:26)
adults who they'll come into they might (70:24 - 70:28)
come into a raid or and they'll just (70:26 - 70:31)
I've seen this in like Pokemon go right (70:28 - 70:33)
and I know that's different than this (70:31 - 70:37)
but there are a lot of adults who will (70:33 - 70:38)
come into a raid or something and (70:37 - 70:39)
they'll be like oh I got this like I (70:38 - 70:41)
know what I'm doing or like you know (70:39 - 70:43)
I've done this before whatever and then (70:41 - 70:45)
you see them pull a Pokemon out that's (70:43 - 70:47)
like oh that Pokemon is not gonna do (70:45 - 70:48)
well here like I'm not really sure why (70:47 - 70:50)
they brought that Pokemon but okay you (70:48 - 70:53)
know I'm not one to be like hey you're (70:50 - 70:54)
not using the right like for a Pokemon (70:53 - 70:56)
go raid right I'm not gonna step over to (70:54 - 70:58)
the person and be like you need to yeah (70:56 - 71:01)
yeah you know (70:58 - 71:04)
um but I have seen that and then those (71:01 - 71:06)
people will just be like we if we lose (71:04 - 71:08)
they're like oh okay and they'll like (71:06 - 71:10)
walk away or something like that I tried (71:08 - 71:14)
not where uh where like an adult will (71:10 - 71:15)
walk away from a five-star raid after (71:14 - 71:18)
like failing it once yeah and they're (71:15 - 71:20)
like yeah okay but yeah the thing is is (71:18 - 71:22)
adults have very different needs as far (71:20 - 71:25)
as how you need to coach them and they (71:22 - 71:27)
have very different needs as far as (71:25 - 71:29)
their time yeah so no I'm not saying (71:27 - 71:31)
it's a I'm just saying like I can see (71:29 - 71:33)
that happening it does happen one thing (71:31 - 71:35)
that I I don't ever want to get into is (71:33 - 71:38)
taking like we can draw some conclusions (71:35 - 71:40)
off of anecdotal what we see but we (71:38 - 71:42)
don't know the whole story like we saw a (71:40 - 71:45)
person bring a 75 Gengar (71:42 - 71:47)
not understanding what the raid was (71:45 - 71:50)
losing we don't know what they did after (71:47 - 71:52)
that right we have no way to speculate (71:50 - 71:53)
if they went and learned (71:52 - 71:56)
jelly sandwich they probably took a bath (71:53 - 71:57)
yeah they may have taken a break they (71:56 - 71:58)
may have said I'm going to come back (71:57 - 72:02)
here who knows what what actually (71:58 - 72:05)
happens right like (72:02 - 72:08)
you can watch like I this is the new (72:05 - 72:11)
patch week for Final Fantasy (72:08 - 72:14)
14 right we have one new dungeon we have (72:11 - 72:16)
a completely new raid all of it's brand (72:14 - 72:19)
new and between Tuesday when it first (72:16 - 72:21)
came out which was (72:19 - 72:24)
rough to Thursday when it was like what (72:21 - 72:26)
we're sailing through just easy not a (72:24 - 72:29)
problem like these are people that (72:26 - 72:32)
they do learn but you you have to (72:29 - 72:37)
approach especially adults in a way that (72:32 - 72:40)
doesn't make them angry and where (72:37 - 72:42)
they're open to feedback (72:40 - 72:46)
because adults shut down I'm a trainer (72:42 - 72:48)
for my I am a traitor we have to deal (72:46 - 72:50)
with this all the time adults will shut (72:48 - 72:53)
down learning within the first two (72:50 - 72:55)
minutes if you don't approach them (72:53 - 72:56)
correctly because they're like no you (72:55 - 72:58)
don't tell me I'm an adult I know what's (72:56 - 73:00)
going on you don't you have nothing to (72:58 - 73:02)
teach me so you have to approach them in (73:00 - 73:04)
a very different way than kids who are (73:02 - 73:06)
like I'm set in front of a teacher and (73:04 - 73:08)
told what to do every day and I have (73:06 - 73:11)
zero level of autonomy like what I'm (73:08 - 73:12)
used to and Greg you're talking about (73:11 - 73:15)
how you're a trainer and what you do if (73:12 - 73:16)
you're training people on something I'm (73:15 - 73:17)
assuming you're talking like work (73:16 - 73:19)
related yeah and what you do for work (73:17 - 73:20)
that can sometimes be more of a (73:19 - 73:22)
necessity for that person's life at that (73:20 - 73:24)
moment if it has to do with some way of (73:22 - 73:27)
their communication and things like that (73:24 - 73:29)
then even like they'll shut you down (73:27 - 73:31)
right it's frustrating is I have to (73:29 - 73:36)
spend we as trainers have to spend (73:31 - 73:38)
an extraordinary amount of time (73:36 - 73:41)
explaining to them why this is worth (73:38 - 73:42)
their time (73:41 - 73:46)
to get them to buy into what we're doing (73:42 - 73:50)
like that is a vital part of how we have (73:46 - 73:53)
to train adults is you have to convince (73:50 - 73:53)
them (73:53 - 73:57)
why this is worth it and telling them (73:53 - 73:59)
because it's your job (73:57 - 74:02)
doesn't cut it you can't tell adults (73:59 - 74:06)
well this this is your job you have to (74:02 - 74:09)
do this they they don't care they're (74:06 - 74:12)
like okay I I my job is fine the way it (74:09 - 74:14)
is I don't need this new information (74:12 - 74:16)
it's (74:14 - 74:19)
teaching adults like I sometimes wish I (74:16 - 74:22)
could teach kids because at least you (74:19 - 74:24)
have a minor amount of authority over (74:22 - 74:28)
kids adults are wild (74:24 - 74:32)
wild so frustrating dealing with adults (74:28 - 74:36)
sometimes that is very true I had I had (74:32 - 74:36)
um (74:36 - 74:41)
I I had the thing that uh (74:36 - 74:43)
you know I kind of suggested where where (74:41 - 74:46)
people were scared to ask for help right (74:43 - 74:47)
like I had somebody come to my screen (74:46 - 74:48)
and they were like hey I was one of (74:47 - 74:49)
those people you were talking on the (74:48 - 74:51)
podcast like I'm I'm here to ask for (74:49 - 74:52)
help can you help me if not no big deal (74:51 - 74:54)
and I was like for sure can help you (74:52 - 74:55)
what do you got they're like I only got (74:54 - 74:58)
a level 100 corre ride on I was like oof (74:55 - 74:59)
okay (74:58 - 75:02)
but I was like all right let me let me (74:59 - 75:04)
grab some people in in my community like (75:02 - 75:06)
in twitch chat that I I know that will (75:04 - 75:08)
help and we we did it right we did it (75:06 - 75:10)
first try they had a cried on I like I (75:08 - 75:12)
was like Hey to be honest you're (75:10 - 75:13)
probably not going to attack because (75:12 - 75:14)
you're not gonna do that much damage I (75:13 - 75:16)
was like defense cheer turn one and then (75:14 - 75:17)
just (75:16 - 75:19)
the heel chair turned two and three and (75:17 - 75:20)
by that that time we should be pretty (75:19 - 75:22)
set up to knock it out and we did and (75:20 - 75:23)
they were really happy and that was (75:22 - 75:24)
great that was like a great feeling they (75:23 - 75:26)
got Cinder Ace they were bummed that (75:24 - 75:28)
they missed Charizard uh like an amazing (75:26 - 75:30)
experience love those experiences right (75:28 - 75:31)
like it's the reason why I ran King's (75:30 - 75:33)
fall a million times I was like I'm not (75:31 - 75:34)
getting any rewards because I only get (75:33 - 75:36)
rewards once a week but like here we are (75:34 - 75:37)
like just helping somebody else complete (75:36 - 75:39)
King's fall again (75:37 - 75:41)
um in Destiny so and then there was (75:39 - 75:43)
another person that was like Hey first (75:41 - 75:44)
time doing raid I have a stored Powers (75:43 - 75:47)
Slowbro I I saw it was good don't know (75:44 - 75:48)
how to do it I was like great I was like (75:47 - 75:50)
you're not gonna do what you heard I'm (75:48 - 75:51)
gonna you're gonna you're gonna iron (75:50 - 75:53)
defense once you're gonna nasty plot (75:51 - 75:54)
twice and then you're gonna hit stored (75:53 - 75:55)
power I was like this is very different (75:54 - 75:57)
from probably what you read and they're (75:55 - 75:59)
like okay and they did it and we one (75:57 - 76:00)
shot it and the reason we went shot it (75:59 - 76:01)
is because I used acid spray three times (76:00 - 76:03)
and then somebody else attack cheered (76:01 - 76:05)
and like I knew the damage calculations (76:03 - 76:06)
would be more than enough so you didn't (76:05 - 76:09)
have to waste three turns iron defensing (76:06 - 76:11)
three turn store powering or iron master (76:09 - 76:13)
plotting and they were like oh my gosh (76:11 - 76:14)
like that worked great and then (76:13 - 76:16)
afterwards they were like I don't really (76:14 - 76:17)
know what stored power does can you (76:16 - 76:19)
explain it and I was like yeah right (76:17 - 76:21)
perfect yeah exactly it's crazy to me (76:19 - 76:23)
because like I explained stored power (76:21 - 76:25)
and like let maybe less than two minutes (76:23 - 76:29)
and it's like it like that's very hard (76:25 - 76:31)
to do in like an infographic and I make (76:29 - 76:33)
infographics for like Instagram and (76:31 - 76:35)
stuff but I was like man I feel like if (76:33 - 76:37)
there are YouTubers or video content or (76:35 - 76:39)
like why would you not explain that like (76:37 - 76:41)
it's relatively easy to explain and I (76:39 - 76:43)
think it's important to explain like (76:41 - 76:45)
what it's doing but it doesn't surprise (76:43 - 76:47)
me that people are like oh I was just (76:45 - 76:49)
told to do these two then these three (76:47 - 76:52)
moves then this move and it's like oh (76:49 - 76:54)
man you can cut a lot of that out if you (76:52 - 76:56)
kind of realize the (76:54 - 76:59)
uh uh what's happening around you (76:56 - 77:04)
this is my eternal struggle as a (76:59 - 77:06)
professional trainer because everybody (77:04 - 77:09)
wants what's now called micro training (77:06 - 77:12)
which is give me the most Vital (77:09 - 77:15)
Information in a couple of minutes I (77:12 - 77:20)
know the rest and my entire career at (77:15 - 77:22)
this point is trying to convince (77:20 - 77:26)
everybody you don't know the rest you (77:22 - 77:27)
don't know like (77:26 - 77:31)
yeah I can look up to at say where's the (77:27 - 77:34)
bathroom in Spanish I don't know how to (77:31 - 77:35)
speak Spanish (77:34 - 77:39)
right like I know how to build this slow (77:35 - 77:41)
Pro I don't know how to play the rest of (77:39 - 77:43)
the game right and a lot of people focus (77:41 - 77:46)
on short bite content and it's very (77:43 - 77:48)
popular and it works really well but (77:46 - 77:51)
your audience you don't know that your (77:48 - 77:54)
audience knows the context upon which (77:51 - 77:57)
short bite video fits and there's just (77:54 - 77:59)
not a lot of content creators or a lot (77:57 - 78:01)
of trainers out there that are like I'm (77:59 - 78:03)
gonna build videos around the context (78:01 - 78:05)
because context doesn't isn't as Snappy (78:03 - 78:07)
and doesn't do as well it's also though (78:05 - 78:09)
based on like the person who is (78:07 - 78:11)
receiving that information's time right (78:09 - 78:14)
like you were just saying like time that (78:11 - 78:16)
person may have seen one video or read (78:14 - 78:18)
one article that said like here's a (78:16 - 78:20)
build or something you know something (78:18 - 78:21)
along those lines and they didn't look (78:20 - 78:23)
any further right our IGN has like yeah (78:21 - 78:25)
this is the best build first interview (78:23 - 78:27)
right and then they came in they're like (78:25 - 78:29)
hey I gotta do the cinderius raid I've (78:27 - 78:31)
got you know the next 20 minutes or 15 (78:29 - 78:33)
minutes where I'm free to do this thing (78:31 - 78:35)
that's only here this weekend hey help (78:33 - 78:36)
me do this thing and it's like okay well (78:35 - 78:39)
well you gotta build because you saw (78:36 - 78:40)
that you know you read that article on (78:39 - 78:43)
polygon or whatever IGN or some content (78:40 - 78:44)
creator (78:43 - 78:46)
um and now you're here (78:44 - 78:48)
and it's like okay but (78:46 - 78:50)
a few more minutes of research you would (78:48 - 78:52)
have seen how this works but it's like (78:50 - 78:53)
at that point they're like well I didn't (78:52 - 78:54)
have a few more minutes I just saw this (78:53 - 78:56)
article about this thing and then you (78:54 - 78:59)
know came in and did this and so (78:56 - 79:01)
I think it's kind of tough (78:59 - 79:02)
it's tough it's tough when you don't (79:01 - 79:04)
have context on the receiving end and (79:02 - 79:05)
it's also tough when you don't have (79:04 - 79:06)
context of what you're what you like (79:05 - 79:09)
you're walking into right also Google (79:06 - 79:10)
likes to do that thing where it will (79:09 - 79:11)
show just the build in the middle window (79:10 - 79:13)
and cut out the rest of the context (79:11 - 79:15)
you're like sure yeah yeah or when it (79:13 - 79:18)
says don't use this build is those two (79:15 - 79:20)
sentences above it but they're just (79:18 - 79:22)
seeing the build you're like yeah only (79:20 - 79:25)
use this build this way and then but (79:22 - 79:26)
they don't show that they're just like (79:25 - 79:27)
here's the build (79:26 - 79:28)
now there were there were a ton of (79:27 - 79:30)
trainers (79:28 - 79:31)
um this weekend that I played with that (79:30 - 79:33)
they were like my only level 100 is (79:31 - 79:35)
skeleturge or My Level only 100 is (79:33 - 79:38)
mimikyu or my only level 100 is uh (79:35 - 79:42)
whatever insert Pokemon here and we were (79:38 - 79:43)
able to get all of those people through (79:42 - 79:45)
sin race because the other three Pokemon (79:43 - 79:48)
had strategy and the person who was like (79:45 - 79:50)
this is the only thing I had they were (79:48 - 79:52)
like willing to listen and they were (79:50 - 79:54)
like excited that they were like okay I (79:52 - 79:55)
know what my role is my role is going to (79:54 - 79:58)
be like defense cheer heel cheer if I (79:55 - 80:01)
have leer or Screech or whatever like (79:58 - 80:03)
I'm going to use that like and that's (80:01 - 80:05)
great like that's the kind of like (80:03 - 80:07)
person you want to play with right like (80:05 - 80:09)
somebody who's like open to being like (80:07 - 80:12)
cool I'm like very I'm like ready to do (80:09 - 80:15)
this with you guys yeah well and I'll (80:12 - 80:17)
tell you like if you take (80:15 - 80:20)
um just a random Pokemon player who's (80:17 - 80:22)
gonna jump into these raids and let's (80:20 - 80:24)
say they got a level 100 something that (80:22 - 80:26)
doesn't help right something where the (80:24 - 80:28)
attacks aren't gonna help help and (80:26 - 80:31)
you're expecting them to know to cheer (80:28 - 80:34)
like they won't right like because when (80:31 - 80:36)
are you ever doing that other than in (80:34 - 80:39)
raids right you see you the menu pops up (80:36 - 80:41)
you know I have four attacks you go to (80:39 - 80:43)
the attacks you don't even click down to (80:41 - 80:44)
see what is the cheer one right it's (80:43 - 80:46)
just I'm gonna go into my attacks I'm (80:44 - 80:48)
going to attack well so three years of (80:46 - 80:51)
sword and shield where cheery happened (80:48 - 80:53)
when you were dead yeah right right (80:51 - 80:55)
exactly and it was and it was forced (80:53 - 80:57)
right it was you it was the only thing (80:55 - 81:00)
you could do when you had fainted so now (80:57 - 81:02)
it's like it's an option and (81:00 - 81:06)
I guarantee you anyone who hasn't taken (81:02 - 81:08)
the time for good or bad reason I mean (81:06 - 81:10)
like not blaming them but anybody who (81:08 - 81:12)
hasn't looked into it very much is (81:10 - 81:13)
probably just going to go straight to (81:12 - 81:14)
attacks and then do one of their four (81:13 - 81:18)
attacks they're not going to go to cheer (81:14 - 81:18)
uh last bit of news was the uh 1008 (81:18 - 81:25)
trailer yeah (81:22 - 81:29)
um they also so in in the in the in the (81:25 - 81:31)
announcing the having that it was like (81:29 - 81:33)
eight minutes I think that trailer was (81:31 - 81:35)
eight minutes which felt like 30 seconds (81:33 - 81:38)
when you were watching it if yeah bye (81:35 - 81:39)
well I guess it probably (81:38 - 81:41)
shows how great that video was since it (81:39 - 81:43)
went by so fast (81:41 - 81:45)
um they announced the tan the mouse they (81:43 - 81:46)
announced the Seven Star poison they (81:45 - 81:49)
also said a scarlet and violet (81:46 - 81:52)
update will come at the end late (81:49 - 81:55)
February I think were their words 1.2 so (81:52 - 81:58)
assuming that (81:55 - 82:01)
when when Scarlet lost it was (81:58 - 82:05)
1.0.1 that only added online play and (82:01 - 82:07)
then there was 1.1 (82:05 - 82:08)
which (82:07 - 82:13)
was when they added Charizard and (82:08 - 82:16)
they fixed the cloning glitch (82:13 - 82:19)
and then they fixed the Elite Four music (82:16 - 82:21)
thing and then they fixed the RNG thing (82:19 - 82:23)
in competitive so they did do a quite (82:21 - 82:26)
quite a couple of fixes for the stuff (82:23 - 82:27)
they're still a lot broken with this (82:26 - 82:28)
game (82:27 - 82:31)
uh if if there was one thing on my wish (82:28 - 82:35)
list of what they could fix I I would (82:31 - 82:36)
love to say frame rate because the frame (82:35 - 82:38)
rate's so bad but I think my number one (82:36 - 82:40)
thing would be the PC (82:38 - 82:44)
and how terribly slow it loads and how (82:40 - 82:45)
you can't like (82:44 - 82:48)
drag and drop Pokemon from different (82:45 - 82:50)
boxes like you used to in the old game (82:48 - 82:52)
and the only way to equip or look at (82:50 - 82:54)
ribbons is by removing them from your PC (82:52 - 82:56)
and putting them in your party by the (82:54 - 82:58)
way there's a bunch of people I saw that (82:56 - 83:00)
um on my tick tocks other people's tick (82:58 - 83:02)
tocks Instagram that are like my (83:00 - 83:05)
cinderace didn't have a mark it does but (83:02 - 83:08)
because the PC is so terribly broken you (83:05 - 83:10)
have to move the cinderace to your party (83:08 - 83:12)
or the Charizard and then turn the mark (83:10 - 83:15)
on and then move it back to the PC (83:12 - 83:18)
um I don't know if 1.2 will fix the PC (83:15 - 83:21)
uh uh but my my number one wish list (83:18 - 83:25)
would be the PC uh my maybe my number (83:21 - 83:27)
two would be frame rate I don't know I (83:25 - 83:30)
number two is getting stuck in the cheer (83:27 - 83:33)
menu in raids where you can't actually (83:30 - 83:35)
hit the button you wanted to cheer you (83:33 - 83:37)
can't back out you're just stuck there (83:35 - 83:40)
for okay so I have this one percent of (83:37 - 83:43)
the time Greg it's it's either it works (83:40 - 83:44)
or it doesn't it's like finding a shiny (83:43 - 83:46)
you either find it or you don't uh if (83:44 - 83:48)
you hit the home button and go back out (83:46 - 83:50)
to the menu (83:48 - 83:53)
if you hit the home button and then you (83:50 - 83:56)
go back in that's fixed it for me and (83:53 - 83:59)
then I got unstuck try that no no no no (83:56 - 84:01)
no no no (83:59 - 84:03)
bad you also might just disconnect from (84:01 - 84:06)
the rain yeah correct bad who this is (84:03 - 84:10)
bad stop fix it (84:06 - 84:12)
who knows (84:10 - 84:15)
um My worry is that the 1.2 update only (84:12 - 84:18)
adds Pokemon (84:15 - 84:21)
nothing else yeah that's my expect I (84:18 - 84:23)
would I would hold your expectations of (84:21 - 84:26)
that at the moment yeah who knows (84:23 - 84:27)
um (84:26 - 84:30)
the video is good the 1008 video was (84:27 - 84:31)
good (84:30 - 84:34)
um obviously they made a big deal about (84:31 - 84:36)
goldango still don't know how to say its (84:34 - 84:38)
name golden gold golden go being the a (84:36 - 84:40)
thousandth Pokemon by the way I don't (84:38 - 84:42)
care which one it is pronounced I just (84:40 - 84:43)
don't know which one it is I don't know (84:42 - 84:46)
which it is yeah uh it's the 1000 (84:43 - 84:48)
Pokemon (84:46 - 84:49)
um (84:48 - 84:51)
yeah I don't know I like the trailer I (84:49 - 84:52)
don't know if you guys had any extra (84:51 - 84:54)
thoughts on it (84:52 - 84:56)
trailer I don't know what to call it (84:54 - 85:00)
video presentation no preview 25-year (84:56 - 85:04)
recap or 27 year recap (85:00 - 85:04)
it was cute it was fun (85:05 - 85:08)
um (85:07 - 85:13)
it was entertaining uh I (85:08 - 85:15)
I felt a little towards the end when (85:13 - 85:16)
they were going through each one and (85:15 - 85:18)
Counting doing the numbers I'm like okay (85:16 - 85:20)
you could you could have put a bunch of (85:18 - 85:21)
these on the screen at the same time and (85:20 - 85:23)
sped this whole thing up I thought they (85:21 - 85:25)
were gonna do one by one the entire I (85:23 - 85:28)
was happy I was like I was like oh all (85:25 - 85:30)
the starters that makes sense and then I (85:28 - 85:32)
was like oh we're doing like 20 grand (85:30 - 85:34)
like root one Pokemon at once yeah well (85:32 - 85:35)
we're burning through this but it was (85:34 - 85:38)
still eight minutes long like yeah (85:35 - 85:40)
I liked the grouping I like the way they (85:38 - 85:41)
did the grouping right and then they had (85:40 - 85:43)
like the baby Pokemon at one point and (85:41 - 85:45)
then just kind of seeing the different (85:43 - 85:48)
groups and and thinking like oh that's (85:45 - 85:50)
kind of cool to to you know see how (85:48 - 85:52)
those were grouped together or see you (85:50 - 85:53)
know or kind of try to figure out why (85:52 - 85:55)
they were grouped together to see why (85:53 - 85:57)
why and how they grouped certain ones (85:55 - 86:00)
together yeah yeah totally (85:57 - 86:02)
I didn't realize I I guess like we've (86:00 - 86:03)
talked about it before I know we've (86:02 - 86:05)
talked about it before but then I didn't (86:03 - 86:06)
put two and two together until they did (86:05 - 86:08)
the Pokedex where they showed the (86:06 - 86:11)
Paradox Pokemon and then they showed um (86:08 - 86:13)
the four (86:11 - 86:16)
ruin the treasure ruins like the four (86:13 - 86:18)
legendary Pokemon and then they showed (86:16 - 86:22)
um roaring Moon and iron (86:18 - 86:25)
Valiant Valiant yeah and I was like oh (86:22 - 86:26)
wait why are those two not with the (86:25 - 86:29)
first set of paradox and then I realized (86:26 - 86:30)
both of those Pokemon were based off (86:29 - 86:32)
Megas (86:30 - 86:34)
but also like (86:32 - 86:36)
it would mess up the golden go thing (86:34 - 86:38)
yeah but it's still like those those two (86:36 - 86:40)
Pokemon are respectively based off mega (86:38 - 86:43)
forms and they're not with the initial (86:40 - 86:45)
pairing that were the I just thought I (86:43 - 86:47)
don't think it means like I don't think (86:45 - 86:49)
well it was better than that I was (86:47 - 86:50)
confused about that as well because (86:49 - 86:54)
after because okay so when they started (86:50 - 86:56)
doing the paldayin Pokemon those were (86:54 - 86:59)
all what their National (86:56 - 87:01)
um Dex number is right like that was (86:59 - 87:03)
kind of where that started yeah that's (87:01 - 87:04)
how they got to the obviously the golden (87:03 - 87:06)
go being a thousand but (87:04 - 87:09)
I just thought it was weird that they (87:06 - 87:11)
unless I was watching that incorrectly (87:09 - 87:13)
but I thought it was weird that they cut (87:11 - 87:15)
they did separate out the (87:13 - 87:18)
uh Paradox Pokemon (87:15 - 87:21)
like from each other rated outwards I (87:18 - 87:22)
just thought that that was weird that (87:21 - 87:24)
they even separated them up from from (87:22 - 87:26)
each other yeah (87:24 - 87:27)
um (87:26 - 87:29)
because the last eight weren't yeah what (87:27 - 87:31)
was one through four one through four (87:29 - 87:33)
was the the four (87:31 - 87:36)
um yeah one thousand one was uh the slug (87:33 - 87:41)
1002 was the scoliosis leopard 1003 was (87:36 - 87:45)
the ashtray and then 1004 was the the (87:41 - 87:48)
the fish the Cutie right so then five (87:45 - 87:51)
six seven and eight were four of the (87:48 - 87:56)
five and six were mega salamance roar (87:51 - 87:58)
AKA roaring Moon and then Gallade and (87:56 - 88:01)
Gardevoir iron Valiant and then seven (87:58 - 88:04)
was chloridon and then eight was me (88:01 - 88:07)
right on yeah oh right right okay okay (88:04 - 88:08)
so I guess it wasn't as different as I (88:07 - 88:09)
thought but (88:08 - 88:11)
I still thought it was weird that I (88:09 - 88:12)
separated them out (88:11 - 88:14)
um from each other but I guess if (88:12 - 88:16)
they're based on the megas that that (88:14 - 88:18)
makes more sense (88:16 - 88:21)
the one thing I wish they had not done (88:18 - 88:24)
is ended that with the catch em all (88:21 - 88:27)
motto again that that thing needed to be (88:24 - 88:31)
stay buried and never come back that (88:27 - 88:33)
dude why why would you why would you (88:31 - 88:35)
talk about that at this point why would (88:33 - 88:36)
you bring that up why would why even (88:35 - 88:39)
mention it I mean okay they said they (88:36 - 88:41)
weren't gonna do a national decks and (88:39 - 88:43)
where how many main Series games deep (88:41 - 88:45)
now five main serious games deep on the (88:43 - 88:47)
switch and there's no national decks in (88:45 - 88:48)
any of them (88:47 - 88:51)
just just leave it just leave it just (88:48 - 88:53)
you did you didn't have to bring company (88:51 - 88:56)
done fighting type for cinderius they (88:53 - 88:57)
know what they're doing they know what (88:56 - 89:00)
buttons they're pushing (88:57 - 89:00)
I mean this just they're just trolling (89:00 - 89:05)
people at that point oh yeah yeah I'm (89:03 - 89:07)
I'm not here for it here for game free (89:05 - 89:12)
trolling their fan base at this point (89:07 - 89:12)
they're probably like this is the only (89:12 - 89:16)
video game keeping the lights on (89:14 - 89:19)
look at this (89:16 - 89:19)
uh okay well that's that's our that's (89:20 - 89:24)
our episode for today (89:22 - 89:26)
um (89:24 - 89:29)
uh a bunch of stuff on YouTube like I (89:26 - 89:30)
said if you want to see my reaction to (89:29 - 89:33)
the 8 1008 that's on YouTube I did a (89:30 - 89:36)
huge video it took me two days to edit (89:33 - 89:39)
it and cut it and all that stuff (89:36 - 89:40)
um (89:39 - 89:43)
uh about what is actually happening in a (89:40 - 89:45)
Raid Battle (89:43 - 89:47)
um I had to do that Raid Battle like (89:45 - 89:50)
solo to show (89:47 - 89:52)
to like break it down and like slow it (89:50 - 89:53)
down (89:52 - 89:56)
um it works for both like solo and Co-op (89:53 - 89:59)
it is me fighting send race that just (89:56 - 90:00)
because cinderace is gone doesn't mean (89:59 - 90:02)
like that video is irrelevant it's to (90:00 - 90:04)
show you mechanics of the battle not (90:02 - 90:06)
specifically this is how you defeat (90:04 - 90:07)
cinderace (90:06 - 90:09)
um so you can take what you learned (90:07 - 90:10)
there (90:09 - 90:11)
um I've heard a bunch of feedback that (90:10 - 90:13)
it was really helpful and I didn't know (90:11 - 90:15)
this uh people didn't know how Critical (90:13 - 90:17)
Hits worked (90:15 - 90:19)
um like people were very shocked that (90:17 - 90:22)
Critical Hits ignore stat changes so (90:19 - 90:24)
like if your cinderace is like negative (90:22 - 90:27)
any Pokemon I'm just using cinderes for (90:24 - 90:28)
example if your cinderius is negative (90:27 - 90:31)
four the critical hit ignores that and (90:28 - 90:34)
then boosts the damage or if you're like (90:31 - 90:35)
really bulky like if you're a Slowbro (90:34 - 90:38)
with six six plus six or three iron (90:35 - 90:42)
defenses critical hit ignores that like (90:38 - 90:43)
that's the whole point of critical hit (90:42 - 90:45)
and why it's like so (90:43 - 90:47)
um (90:45 - 90:48)
[Music] (90:47 - 90:51)
in a battle (90:48 - 90:53)
so uh yeah there's a bunch of like maybe (90:51 - 90:54)
little stuff that you don't know it (90:53 - 90:56)
explains how the raid Shield works and (90:54 - 90:58)
stuff and why you're you feel like (90:56 - 90:59)
you're not doing that much damage when a (90:58 - 91:01)
raid Shield goes up (90:59 - 91:03)
um so a bunch of tips and tricks for (91:01 - 91:04)
that (91:03 - 91:07)
um uh cinderius fight it's on YouTube (91:04 - 91:09)
it's the video with the armor Rouge in (91:07 - 91:10)
the thumbnail if that makes it easy for (91:09 - 91:12)
you (91:10 - 91:15)
um yeah uh and some non-pokemon news if (91:12 - 91:17)
