[Music] (0:17 - 0:22)
what's up everyone welcome to the fifth (0:23 - 0:30)
episode of the super picnic Club I am (0:27 - 0:32)
your host Steve we'll get through this (0:30 - 0:37)
show eventually uh with me is Greg (0:32 - 0:37)
oh I want to be the best (0:37 - 0:42)
like no one ever no one was before (0:41 - 0:45)
except for apparently (0:42 - 0:47)
there are always people who were before (0:45 - 0:50)
there's always a champion there's always (0:47 - 0:52)
am I going to be the best when there's (0:50 - 0:54)
already people like that where like Noah (0:52 - 0:56)
was before what am I doing differently (0:54 - 0:58)
nothing is the question is the answer (0:56 - 1:00)
because there's nothing different about (0:58 - 1:03)
this gym progression (1:00 - 1:06)
uh we got the best from Scotland we got (1:03 - 1:07)
Al (1:06 - 1:11)
that's quite a claim (1:07 - 1:11)
look when the sample size is one maybe (1:11 - 1:18)
two whatever I'll take best best host on (1:14 - 1:20)
this podcast sure I'll take that okay (1:18 - 1:22)
all right from Scotland from from (1:20 - 1:25)
Scotland obviously but uh no I don't I (1:22 - 1:26)
think there's there's still five million (1:25 - 1:28)
people in Scotland it's not like there's (1:26 - 1:32)
no one here gosh that's so tiny it's (1:28 - 1:34)
it's bigger than the multiple of your (1:32 - 1:36)
U.S states all right how are there so (1:34 - 1:39)
few people there yeah but I think is it (1:36 - 1:42)
it's a country thousand (1:39 - 1:42)
we had a thing Greg that was called the (1:43 - 1:49)
hailing clearances and you know half of (1:45 - 1:51)
the people went away to America so (1:49 - 1:55)
that's weird and rightfully so (1:51 - 1:57)
oh yeah so okay here's the thing (1:55 - 1:59)
Minneapolis metro area because we have (1:57 - 2:01)
we have to include media playing because (1:59 - 2:03)
they're so close plus the metro area is (2:01 - 2:05)
roughly 4 million people (2:03 - 2:09)
oh my word that's insane it's like so (2:05 - 2:10)
many point seven something like that (2:09 - 2:14)
million people okay so today's uh show (2:10 - 2:17)
is going to be the was it the the (2:14 - 2:18)
Champions path I think they call it (2:17 - 2:20)
Champions path the path to Victory the (2:18 - 2:23)
path Victory Road Victory Life oh (2:20 - 2:25)
Victory Road uh so for spoilers purposes (2:23 - 2:27)
we're talking about all (2:25 - 2:29)
um eight gym leaders spoiler there's (2:27 - 2:31)
eight we're gonna talk about all four (2:29 - 2:34)
elite four members that's why it says (2:31 - 2:37)
elite four one of these times they're (2:34 - 2:38)
gonna have (2:37 - 2:40)
I would argue actually I'm gonna make (2:38 - 2:41)
the argument this is actually the elite (2:40 - 2:44)
three (2:41 - 2:44)
what I refuse to acknowledge one of (2:44 - 2:50)
those members okay completely they are I (2:47 - 2:53)
refuse this is the elite three for me uh (2:50 - 2:54)
and then and then we have the the (2:53 - 2:56)
champion and then there's another battle (2:54 - 2:57)
after the champion that we'll talk about (2:56 - 2:59)
that's our that's our goal for this (2:57 - 3:00)
episode (2:59 - 3:01)
um (3:00 - 3:03)
you know I thought we could spend (3:01 - 3:05)
another episode talking about level (3:03 - 3:07)
progression and open world and scale (3:05 - 3:10)
drive to your home (3:07 - 3:13)
and end your existence (3:10 - 3:15)
I know where you live I know how to get (3:13 - 3:18)
there and it will I will do it on camera (3:15 - 3:21)
okay clicks I think I think some of (3:18 - 3:24)
these gym leaders are forgettable (3:21 - 3:26)
um that's every region that's not (3:24 - 3:28)
specific here I'll I'll read all the gym (3:26 - 3:30)
leaders maybe you guys tell me your (3:28 - 3:31)
favorite I'm going to tell you I don't (3:30 - 3:33)
remember most of their names except for (3:31 - 3:36)
one yeah okay I don't know why I (3:33 - 3:37)
remember Katie's name maybe because it's (3:36 - 3:39)
just Katie I I can never remember I'm (3:37 - 3:41)
looking at the names now I can't I can (3:39 - 3:42)
never remember tulip I can't remember (3:41 - 3:45)
kofu okay so here here's the uh here's (3:42 - 3:47)
the order (3:45 - 3:48)
um we're not having a conversation about (3:47 - 3:51)
order here's the order though uh we have (3:48 - 3:54)
Katie who is uh from you know what's (3:51 - 3:57)
worse than the names the cities holy cow (3:54 - 3:58)
I can't remember a single City in this (3:57 - 3:59)
game (3:58 - 4:03)
so Katie is from uh corn court and I'm (3:59 - 4:05)
gonna say I'm all wrong by the way (4:03 - 4:08)
cortando she is bug then we have (4:05 - 4:11)
brassius from artesan who is grass we (4:08 - 4:14)
have Iona uh from lavencia who is (4:11 - 4:15)
electric (4:14 - 4:17)
uh (4:15 - 4:20)
we have kofu from (4:17 - 4:22)
Hit Me with the garage (4:20 - 4:26)
okay uh he's watching Rafa (4:22 - 4:31)
uh we have Larry from uh medalli yeah (4:26 - 4:34)
medalli madali they don't stand so is (4:31 - 4:39)
normal we have rhyme from montevera I (4:34 - 4:41)
think I got that one right ghost uh we (4:39 - 4:42)
have tulip (4:41 - 4:46)
from uh alfaranda (4:42 - 4:49)
I don't know um El for nada (4:46 - 4:51)
uh psychic and then we have grusha from (4:49 - 4:55)
glassedo Glass clacido Mountain (4:51 - 4:58)
glaciato oh that sounds fancy like (4:55 - 5:01)
Desperado yeah no nothing like that oh (4:58 - 5:02)
okay (5:01 - 5:05)
all right (5:02 - 5:06)
okay (5:05 - 5:08)
we need to (5:06 - 5:10)
because we'll we'll get to the elite (5:08 - 5:13)
four but if there was a generation (5:10 - 5:16)
that needed to break the gender binary (5:13 - 5:19)
it's this one there are a number of (5:16 - 5:22)
people in the Elite Four and in the gyms (5:19 - 5:25)
that would highly benefit from being (5:22 - 5:27)
able to call themselves them it's all (5:25 - 5:28)
I'm going to say (5:27 - 5:31)
they really really needed to break the (5:28 - 5:34)
gender binary in this one (5:31 - 5:34)
um (5:35 - 5:38)
yeah I think I think maybe uh so the (5:36 - 5:40)
thing I heard is a lot of people just (5:38 - 5:42)
missed Katie and did Katie last yeah (5:40 - 5:46)
well which is which is you know fine I (5:42 - 5:48)
mean like it doesn't here's here was my (5:46 - 5:49)
problem (5:48 - 5:52)
I trusted my twitch chat never trust (5:49 - 5:55)
twitch chat they said that so I was like (5:52 - 5:57)
oh (5:55 - 6:00)
uh who who says it was it was it nimona (5:57 - 6:02)
who is like oh Jim challenge starts (6:00 - 6:06)
starts to the East and then starts to (6:02 - 6:09)
the west west height and starts to the (6:06 - 6:13)
east yeah and I was like oh there's a (6:09 - 6:15)
different I kind of figured there was a (6:13 - 6:17)
different gym before barossius if you (6:15 - 6:18)
were to go back and listen to my like (6:17 - 6:20)
Nintendo preview or even read the (6:18 - 6:21)
comments on that YouTube video people (6:20 - 6:22)
are like why why are you just not (6:21 - 6:24)
calling brassius first and I was like oh (6:22 - 6:26)
cause like Nintendo made it very clear (6:24 - 6:28)
that brassius isn't (6:26 - 6:30)
they didn't say brassius was at first (6:28 - 6:32)
but they were like they never used that (6:30 - 6:34)
word but they didn't tell me that there (6:32 - 6:36)
was somebody before so when I hovered (6:34 - 6:37)
over the map and I was like oh okay cool (6:36 - 6:41)
Katie bug makes sense first uh I just (6:37 - 6:44)
like went there and went in because I (6:41 - 6:45)
assumed (6:44 - 6:48)
that she would be like level 11 and 12 (6:45 - 6:50)
because that's like every single Pokemon (6:48 - 6:52)
she's like 15. (6:50 - 6:55)
um but I I only went in with uh (6:52 - 6:57)
like two I was doing a water type (6:55 - 6:58)
Pokemon playthrough so I only had like (6:57 - 7:00)
two water Pokemon at the time one being (6:58 - 7:02)
my starter she just like roasted me she (7:00 - 7:04)
just like ran through me because I was (7:02 - 7:06)
five levels under and I only had two (7:04 - 7:08)
Pokemon and she had three (7:06 - 7:08)
um (7:08 - 7:11)
but I think maybe that's why she was (7:08 - 7:15)
memorable for me is because I lost it (7:11 - 7:15)
fine for like a first pet gym leader (7:17 - 7:24)
she's like fine yeah the okay (7:20 - 7:24)
none of the puzzles before the gyms are (7:24 - 7:30)
any good oh I think we're stretching (7:27 - 7:32)
we're stretching to call them puzzles (7:30 - 7:35)
puzzles uh there's there's two that I (7:32 - 7:37)
would consider puzzles like this one was (7:35 - 7:39)
like uh dexterity challenge (7:37 - 7:42)
but whatever kick a ball through a (7:39 - 7:45)
course uh it's an olive right pick a (7:42 - 7:49)
ball through a course where there are (7:45 - 7:52)
no real obstacles and nobody like at (7:49 - 7:54)
least when I had to herd sheep there was (7:52 - 7:55)
a dog that came and barked things away (7:54 - 7:59)
this was just oh I just have to get it (7:55 - 8:01)
over this slightly small ramp a couple (7:59 - 8:03)
of times yeah this is I thought there (8:01 - 8:05)
would be somebody in there I thought (8:03 - 8:07)
somebody would stop me to battle I (8:05 - 8:09)
thought there would be like things (8:07 - 8:11)
popping up out of the ground to send it (8:09 - 8:14)
flying away from me did you become the (8:11 - 8:15)
olive though because I heard some (8:14 - 8:17)
people's games glitched out where they (8:15 - 8:20)
became the uh I I did for a moment and I (8:17 - 8:21)
restarted them like I don't think that's (8:20 - 8:22)
supposed to happen so I'm gonna restart (8:21 - 8:24)
this (8:22 - 8:26)
uh but I'm like that's that's it this is (8:24 - 8:29)
it and that's gonna set the tone for (8:26 - 8:32)
pretty much every other one (8:29 - 8:36)
I think some of them are good uh this (8:32 - 8:38)
one is okay I would not consider this (8:36 - 8:39)
one bad (8:38 - 8:42)
but there are ones I would consider bad (8:39 - 8:44)
they're not bad I don't they're just not (8:42 - 8:45)
interesting (8:44 - 8:47)
yeah I don't think this one felt kind of (8:45 - 8:49)
you know pointless like it didn't feel (8:47 - 8:51)
like oh there was there was there was (8:49 - 8:54)
some challenge to it it was very limited (8:51 - 8:56)
but like you have to kind of vaguely be (8:54 - 8:59)
able to use a controller yeah you know (8:56 - 9:01)
like it's it's not like you just go and (8:59 - 9:03)
battle them right like there's always (9:01 - 9:05)
something to it which was legally (9:03 - 9:08)
interesting my guess to defend why this (9:05 - 9:11)
exists is to teach you how to use the (9:08 - 9:13)
camera if you've never played an open (9:11 - 9:14)
world game (9:13 - 9:16)
because you have to pan the camera a lot (9:14 - 9:21)
to aim The Olive in a direction like you (9:16 - 9:24)
can't I'm sure you could you can I did (9:21 - 9:26)
it you could just never move the camera (9:24 - 9:29)
and just hit it like if you want that (9:26 - 9:33)
like to like get it it's like an S (9:29 - 9:35)
um yeah I'd also be surprised if you (9:33 - 9:36)
hadn't done it by that point like yeah (9:35 - 9:38)
you have to Traverse quite a lot of the (9:36 - 9:40)
world to get to that point now maybe I'm (9:38 - 9:41)
just maybe I'm biased because I'm (9:40 - 9:43)
currently playing through uh Professor (9:41 - 9:45)
Oak challenge of the other game so I'm (9:43 - 9:47)
spending a lot of time in each small (9:45 - 9:50)
area but um like I feel like you you use (9:47 - 9:53)
it quite a bit by that point surely like (9:50 - 9:55)
I'd be surprised if someone managed to (9:53 - 9:57)
get there and not use it at all I mean (9:55 - 9:59)
up until this point you've been playing (9:57 - 10:02)
the game for 14 hours (9:59 - 10:04)
so if you didn't know how to use the (10:02 - 10:06)
camera in those 14 hours I don't know I (10:04 - 10:08)
don't know why Suddenly at the place (10:06 - 10:10)
I mean but half of it is you know (10:08 - 10:13)
cutscenes well (10:10 - 10:15)
they do cut scene heavy the start of the (10:13 - 10:17)
game and then they kind of let off very (10:15 - 10:22)
cinnamon uh she she has a Nimble uh I (10:17 - 10:23)
don't know how to say this Pokemon's (10:22 - 10:25)
name Tara tarantula (10:23 - 10:27)
most tarantula right it's like a (10:25 - 10:29)
tarantula but it's round to round (10:27 - 10:33)
Chiller oh oh I see it now I see it I (10:29 - 10:35)
get it do not have this discussion four (10:33 - 10:38)
episodes ago I don't remember uh and (10:35 - 10:42)
then she she has a Teddy Ursa at the end (10:38 - 10:43)
this um (10:42 - 10:45)
this is my biggest issue with these Gym (10:43 - 10:46)
Battles right okay (10:45 - 10:48)
I feel like they could have done so for (10:46 - 10:50)
the first one right fine whatever you're (10:48 - 10:51)
going to do a random Pokemon that's not (10:50 - 10:54)
the same type so it has (10:51 - 10:55)
so you're you're kind of like a little (10:54 - 10:57)
bit surprised by it right and then they (10:55 - 10:58)
make it the Terror type which is the (10:57 - 11:02)
same type as the other ones but why in (10:58 - 11:04)
the future ones do they not make them (11:02 - 11:07)
more in more interesting types to make (11:04 - 11:10)
it the challenge a little bit more right (11:07 - 11:12)
that's not weak to your Pokemon and then (11:10 - 11:14)
we're gonna make it weak to your Pokemon (11:12 - 11:18)
it's no no Czar no because because I I (11:14 - 11:20)
literally had asked so many people this (11:18 - 11:23)
and people fell for it every single time (11:20 - 11:25)
like (11:23 - 11:27)
when I went into the teddy Ursa right (11:25 - 11:30)
the second time because I got smoked the (11:27 - 11:31)
first time (11:30 - 11:35)
you're bad at that point my my quaxley (11:31 - 11:38)
new low kick (11:35 - 11:40)
and so the teddy Ursa came out and I was (11:38 - 11:43)
like oh low kicks is super effective and (11:40 - 11:44)
then I was like oh wait it's going to (11:43 - 11:46)
tracelize the bug right and so I didn't (11:44 - 11:50)
low kick and I instead Wing attacked and (11:46 - 11:53)
I won right like it was really easy (11:50 - 11:55)
because wing attack like one shot it but (11:53 - 11:57)
the amount of people who fell for it (11:55 - 12:00)
every time I think is way higher than (11:57 - 12:02)
the people who are sitting here sitting (12:00 - 12:05)
like like oh I know it's going to be bug (12:02 - 12:07)
oh I know it's going to be grass oh (12:05 - 12:09)
there are people who come into five-star (12:07 - 12:14)
Terror rates yes yes yes like you had to (12:09 - 12:17)
go through at least eight gyms with this (12:14 - 12:19)
gimmick and you still don't understand (12:17 - 12:23)
it because you I'm like it's electric (12:19 - 12:25)
sure it's normal type (12:23 - 12:26)
is fire (12:25 - 12:28)
but it is now Electric (12:26 - 12:30)
[Laughter] (12:28 - 12:32)
you need to compensate for that stop (12:30 - 12:34)
bringing in things that are water (12:32 - 12:37)
because it may have an electric move pay (12:34 - 12:40)
attention so I I don't disagree with Al (12:37 - 12:42)
of like (12:40 - 12:44)
for for for maybe the hardcore people (12:42 - 12:46)
it's like well where's the well we know (12:44 - 12:48)
what it's going to do right like the (12:46 - 12:49)
grass is going to be grass the electric (12:48 - 12:52)
it's not even just that it just it feels (12:49 - 12:53)
Less Fun it feels like it would have (12:52 - 12:54)
been fun I don't really care about the (12:53 - 12:55)
challenge right I'm not one of these (12:54 - 12:57)
people oh I need my Pokemon go hard (12:55 - 12:59)
right I'm very much like you can make it (12:57 - 13:01)
as hard as you want right but it feels (12:59 - 13:02)
it feels like they missed a trick it (13:01 - 13:04)
feels like it could have been fun to do (13:02 - 13:09)
that makes perfect sense but yes I'll (13:04 - 13:11)
agree with that one 100 so I think I (13:09 - 13:12)
think I think some make a lot of sense (13:11 - 13:15)
and some are really good I think hers is (13:12 - 13:18)
good because like thematically I can go (13:15 - 13:20)
like oh like Teddy Ursa and bugs are (13:18 - 13:22)
like pretty similar right like bears eat (13:20 - 13:25)
honey Honeys are bees like I get the (13:22 - 13:27)
theme there and she's a baker so she (13:25 - 13:29)
would use honey a lot so having a Teddy (13:27 - 13:32)
Ursa like I do think Teddy Ursa fits (13:29 - 13:34)
here (13:32 - 13:37)
um and I like that uh (13:34 - 13:39)
uh I will say this is one of the one of (13:37 - 13:42)
the few times that I wish they had not (13:39 - 13:45)
given away the gym leader gimmick in the (13:42 - 13:46)
trailer (13:45 - 13:50)
I think it would have been more fun to (13:46 - 13:54)
me if if them territory pterosalizing (13:50 - 13:56)
into the type of their gym had not been (13:54 - 13:58)
shown in the trailers because I think it (13:56 - 13:59)
would have been a little bit more of a (13:58 - 14:01)
surprise not like I was surprised in the (13:59 - 14:04)
trailer but then I went into this gym (14:01 - 14:07)
knowing well if one of them does it (14:04 - 14:09)
all of them are gonna do it and it's (14:07 - 14:13)
always going to be the type of their gym (14:09 - 14:15)
and Katie confirmed it (14:13 - 14:18)
I didn't I didn't assume that going into (14:15 - 14:19)
them that that would be the case because (14:18 - 14:22)
like I think the with brassius and his (14:19 - 14:25)
pseudo Widow turning grass like I think (14:22 - 14:28)
that that can be a unique thing right (14:25 - 14:29)
that doesn't mean that they're all going (14:28 - 14:31)
to do the same thing because that was (14:29 - 14:33)
the whole joke about sudowood when it (14:31 - 14:35)
was first introduced (14:33 - 14:37)
um right I'm just saying that once I'd (14:35 - 14:40)
saw that and then when I did Katie and (14:37 - 14:42)
she did it too I'm like okay confirmed (14:40 - 14:45)
right confirmed that this is yeah sure (14:42 - 14:46)
sure like (14:45 - 14:49)
she she as being the first gym leader (14:46 - 14:51)
and brassius being technically the (14:49 - 14:53)
second cut like confirmed this is the (14:51 - 14:54)
pattern (14:53 - 14:56)
and I just need to know that going (14:54 - 14:59)
forward for every gym I wish they hadn't (14:56 - 15:00)
shown that (14:59 - 15:03)
in the trailer so that you had to do a (15:00 - 15:05)
couple to get to verify that that was (15:03 - 15:06)
the pattern (15:05 - 15:09)
uh yeah I mean like I see what they're (15:06 - 15:11)
they're doing here um again there there (15:09 - 15:13)
are the there are the the set of people (15:11 - 15:15)
who fell for it right like oh I went to (15:13 - 15:17)
low kick the teddy Ursa it's now bug I (15:15 - 15:20)
think bug resists fighting (15:17 - 15:23)
um or something of the sort right uh and (15:20 - 15:25)
then when you get to brassius who's the (15:23 - 15:27)
second gym leader we have petal small of (15:25 - 15:32)
pseudowoodo and I think the like (15:27 - 15:35)
I I obviously you know gym leaders are (15:32 - 15:38)
easier or hard air quoting for the audio (15:35 - 15:40)
podcasts depending on your team right (15:38 - 15:43)
like if you went into brassius and you (15:40 - 15:45)
picked way Coco I don't see how you (15:43 - 15:47)
possibly lose like right brassius is (15:45 - 15:48)
probably going to be the easiest one for (15:47 - 15:50)
you here at the beginning (15:48 - 15:54)
um but the like the weird thing is that (15:50 - 15:56)
the I don't even know if the AI would be (15:54 - 15:58)
smart enough or they could program the (15:56 - 16:00)
AI smart enough but you you have a (15:58 - 16:01)
pseudo Widow sitting in front of a Foy (16:00 - 16:04)
Coco and pseudo Widow has the advantage (16:01 - 16:06)
and there's no situation where the (16:04 - 16:08)
computer just the CPU just doesn't (16:06 - 16:12)
terasolize and become instantly weaker (16:08 - 16:14)
um like it still has rock throw which is (16:12 - 16:15)
great (16:14 - 16:19)
uh but I (16:15 - 16:21)
but you have to one shot you otherwise (16:19 - 16:23)
there's one shot in it realistically (16:21 - 16:25)
right and I don't think pseudo would (16:23 - 16:28)
have out speeds at all right like it has (16:25 - 16:31)
sturdy so I guess it does it does (16:28 - 16:32)
survive (16:31 - 16:33)
um (16:32 - 16:35)
and like the like again I think (16:33 - 16:37)
thematically this is really great like (16:35 - 16:39)
everyone at least uh you know people who (16:37 - 16:42)
played gold and silver I think Sudowoodo (16:39 - 16:45)
did trick a lot of people as as kids or (16:42 - 16:47)
even maybe adults of being like well (16:45 - 16:50)
this is obviously a plant and (16:47 - 16:50)
um (16:50 - 16:53)
why why are my fire type moves not (16:50 - 16:54)
working and then it's like oh it's (16:53 - 16:57)
actually a fake it's a rock so like this (16:54 - 16:58)
whole theme at least for brassy is (16:57 - 16:59)
having pseudo and turning into grass (16:58 - 17:02)
like again cool very happy with like the (16:59 - 17:05)
Pokemon Choice here even though like I I (17:02 - 17:07)
think brassius is probably by far the (17:05 - 17:08)
easiest (17:07 - 17:10)
um gym yeah (17:08 - 17:13)
uh I've Katie I believe I blew through (17:10 - 17:16)
all of them there's one that gave me a (17:13 - 17:18)
moment's pause but I blew through all of (17:16 - 17:21)
these like (17:18 - 17:21)
easier but that was purely because I (17:22 - 17:28)
mucked up my ordering uh in how I want (17:24 - 17:29)
to do things I'm not saying there's a (17:28 - 17:32)
specific order thank you very much (17:29 - 17:35)
uh yeah so I went to Katie second and of (17:32 - 17:37)
course because I defeated you know I (17:35 - 17:39)
started with free cocoa so yeah yeah (17:37 - 17:41)
they were both going to be easy anyway (17:39 - 17:44)
and the fact that I had beaten bracia's (17:41 - 17:46)
first meant that there was no way I was (17:44 - 17:49)
getting uh yeah well I think I think (17:46 - 17:52)
brassius and Katie are are so (17:49 - 17:55)
easy for fuego and um quaxley because (17:52 - 17:57)
quaxley gets wing attack really early as (17:55 - 18:00)
well and wing attack destroys both of (17:57 - 18:02)
these people too so I I don't know maybe (18:00 - 18:04)
maybe the Cat Players out there (18:02 - 18:07)
struggled a little yeah I mean there's a (18:04 - 18:10)
lot but there's a lot of fire types yeah (18:07 - 18:15)
no like I found uh uh Char Cadet on my (18:10 - 18:16)
Trek to the Water Gym that ultimately (18:15 - 18:19)
did not pay out dividends so I just had (18:16 - 18:22)
I had a fire type that was also like (18:19 - 18:24)
cool let's just wreck this place (18:22 - 18:28)
uh okay so third would be iono uh I (18:24 - 18:28)
think (18:28 - 18:30)
uh obviously this is the one that gave (18:28 - 18:33)
me the most trouble as somebody who is (18:30 - 18:35)
only running water type Pokemon (18:33 - 18:38)
um I think I lost to her four times uh (18:35 - 18:40)
before I figured it out I didn't I (18:38 - 18:43)
didn't um I didn't go and level up or or (18:40 - 18:45)
oh I actually this is a question I want (18:43 - 18:46)
to ask you guys (18:45 - 18:50)
I never so I did change my team quite a (18:46 - 18:51)
bit we talked about that (18:50 - 18:53)
um I added new water Pokemon when they (18:51 - 18:55)
came I dropped water Pokemon that like I (18:53 - 18:58)
replaced with others I never used candy (18:55 - 19:01)
or anything (18:58 - 19:03)
um I I thought that there was enough to (19:01 - 19:05)
do whether that was trainers or just you (19:03 - 19:06)
know spending 10 minutes to catch a (19:05 - 19:08)
couple Pokemon like not like catching (19:06 - 19:09)
the same Pokemon just like oh I need to (19:08 - 19:12)
add these five Pokemon to my decks and I (19:09 - 19:13)
should probably grab like one or two (19:12 - 19:15)
levels along the way so two birds one (19:13 - 19:19)
stone like I I never felt (19:15 - 19:23)
under leveled going into something (19:19 - 19:26)
um that wasn't like intentional I mean (19:23 - 19:28)
Katie the obviously I said I was like (19:26 - 19:30)
five under but like you know when I got (19:28 - 19:32)
to Yono I was like oh I'm like the same (19:30 - 19:34)
level as her cool (19:32 - 19:36)
I definitely was under leveled for a (19:34 - 19:38)
significant part of the game but that (19:36 - 19:39)
was purely because of how I was playing (19:38 - 19:42)
the first time right the way that I (19:39 - 19:43)
played like the fact that I played both (19:42 - 19:46)
of these games very early on is kind of (19:43 - 19:48)
weird and unique to only a few people (19:46 - 19:51)
and the first the first time I do I just (19:48 - 19:52)
rushed through it as quickly as possible (19:51 - 19:55)
to get everything done and then go on to (19:52 - 19:57)
the second one so yeah I was I wasn't (19:55 - 19:59)
defeating any trailer that I didn't need (19:57 - 20:02)
to I wasn't you know leveling up more (19:59 - 20:05)
than I needed to the first time (20:02 - 20:10)
uh I was on par until (20:05 - 20:10)
I want to say until the ice gym (20:12 - 20:18)
I I think towards the end where I got (20:15 - 20:20)
tired of hunting down trainers (20:18 - 20:22)
and I was just like I don't want to (20:20 - 20:25)
catch anything more I'm just tired I'm (20:22 - 20:27)
tired of fighting I just (20:25 - 20:29)
just want to get through this game (20:27 - 20:32)
uh so I think the last I want to say (20:29 - 20:37)
like the last two gyms and (20:32 - 20:40)
the last team star I was (20:37 - 20:44)
under level then I had to grind a bit (20:40 - 20:44)
um she has the uh waterell (20:45 - 20:51)
uh watch roll on my watch roll watch (20:48 - 20:54)
roll yeah uh belly bolt Luxio and Miss (20:51 - 20:56)
magius (20:54 - 20:56)
um (20:56 - 20:58)
I think (20:56 - 21:03)
that she has the best strategy this (20:58 - 21:04)
isn't just because I was using a water (21:03 - 21:06)
Pokemon I do because I watch other (21:04 - 21:09)
people play against her (21:06 - 21:11)
um and I try to do that like I tried to (21:09 - 21:12)
see (21:11 - 21:16)
uh I think I think sometimes and uh not (21:12 - 21:18)
discrediting anyone's experience but (21:16 - 21:20)
like you you could you could do a gym (21:18 - 21:21)
and be like well that was super easy (21:20 - 21:24)
like this game is easy right like it was (21:21 - 21:25)
easy but but watching other people play (21:24 - 21:27)
with other teams and seeing their (21:25 - 21:30)
strategy sometimes it like (21:27 - 21:32)
you kind of see what the gym was (21:30 - 21:33)
supposed to do right like I blew through (21:32 - 21:36)
brassius and then I watched somebody do (21:33 - 21:39)
brassius and they they had the cat right (21:36 - 21:40)
they they didn't have a fire type (21:39 - 21:42)
Pokemon they didn't have a flying type (21:40 - 21:45)
and I was like oh if you don't like one (21:42 - 21:48)
shot brassiest Pokemon his default is to (21:45 - 21:50)
like put you to sleep and then he (21:48 - 21:51)
attacks and as soon as you wake up he (21:50 - 21:54)
tries to put you to sleep again and I (21:51 - 21:56)
watch them struggle with it their (21:54 - 21:58)
Pokemon were well over leveled they just (21:56 - 21:59)
couldn't they just didn't want (21:58 - 22:02)
shopracias so he could like set up his (21:59 - 22:04)
strategy I think iono out of all the gym (22:02 - 22:06)
leaders I actually think she has the (22:04 - 22:08)
best strategy right like (22:06 - 22:11)
uh belly bolt is going to return a bunch (22:08 - 22:13)
of damage to you if you if you don't one (22:11 - 22:16)
shot it Luxio is going to intimidate you (22:13 - 22:17)
right before her star comes out (22:16 - 22:20)
watchroll has that like thing where if (22:17 - 22:22)
you like the wind power ability which is (22:20 - 22:23)
like really great to like show you that (22:22 - 22:25)
that ability if you try to slow it down (22:23 - 22:27)
but then the Miss Maggie is having (22:25 - 22:30)
levitate and then turning into an (22:27 - 22:32)
electric type so therefore having no (22:30 - 22:35)
weakness I think is just fantastic now (22:32 - 22:37)
of course somebody's be like well I (22:35 - 22:38)
didn't see any of that like yeah if you (22:37 - 22:41)
had Claude sire you probably didn't see (22:38 - 22:43)
a single move she did right like Cloud (22:41 - 22:47)
sire cleans this team up easily uh but (22:43 - 22:50)
for those that didn't have like a uh an (22:47 - 22:53)
electric type Pokemon even like not so (22:50 - 22:54)
you can't hit Miss Maggie is super (22:53 - 22:57)
effective and then she's charge beaming (22:54 - 23:00)
and she's like powering up every single (22:57 - 23:03)
time so there there's (23:00 - 23:05)
not really I I I don't know me unless (23:03 - 23:06)
you're really over leveled I don't know (23:05 - 23:08)
what move would one shot this miss (23:06 - 23:10)
magius you almost always have to two (23:08 - 23:11)
shot her (23:10 - 23:14)
um so yeah I think I two shot I I mean I (23:11 - 23:16)
used my grass my grass normal that was (23:14 - 23:19)
just like we good we're gonna Siege (23:16 - 23:21)
y'all and then I'm just gonna drink your (23:19 - 23:24)
life out of your soul but I I think I (23:21 - 23:26)
think as a team like I felt like there (23:24 - 23:28)
was a lot of thought put into this but (23:26 - 23:29)
again like I said if you had like a (23:28 - 23:31)
cloud side or something you'll never see (23:29 - 23:32)
that (23:31 - 23:35)
the Miss medius is certainly better in (23:32 - 23:37)
terms of like the Pokemon that to (23:35 - 23:39)
rationalizes than most of them actually (23:37 - 23:41)
yes yeah as you say there's actually an (23:39 - 23:44)
advantage to it in this case unlike the (23:41 - 23:45)
previous ones which is just oh no we're (23:44 - 23:48)
still weak to what you had before (23:45 - 23:50)
um whereas in this case it's not right (23:48 - 23:53)
so yeah I also think we need to talk (23:50 - 23:55)
about (23:53 - 23:57)
it is clear paldea does not pay their (23:55 - 24:00)
gym leaders (23:57 - 24:00)
to be Gym Leaders these people all have (24:00 - 24:05)
careers yeah that are way more exciting (24:02 - 24:09)
to them than being a gym leader (24:05 - 24:11)
well I think it's I think it's maybe (24:09 - 24:13)
that disconnect from like how (24:11 - 24:16)
in Galler being a gym leader was very (24:13 - 24:19)
prestigious and people tried to be Gym (24:16 - 24:21)
Leaders where like you you know that was (24:19 - 24:24)
the rumor of the 16 gyms of like yeah (24:21 - 24:26)
people want to be a part of the gym (24:24 - 24:27)
challenge but they have to earn their (24:26 - 24:29)
way here in this it just seems like the (24:27 - 24:30)
gym leaders and which is fine by the way (24:29 - 24:33)
in this it just seems like we're Gym (24:30 - 24:35)
Leaders because the school system needs (24:33 - 24:38)
roses a couple bones to like humor the (24:35 - 24:40)
kids when they come on through (24:38 - 24:43)
I I will say (24:40 - 24:46)
having had just replayed sword and (24:43 - 24:49)
shield before this (24:46 - 24:52)
the excitement of walking into that (24:49 - 24:53)
screaming Stadium (24:52 - 24:56)
that was so great in sword and shield I (24:53 - 24:57)
was just like (24:56 - 24:59)
oh (24:57 - 25:02)
yeah I do this doesn't feel as exciting (24:59 - 25:05)
I felt the same and I felt it was a bit (25:02 - 25:08)
weird because they use almost identical (25:05 - 25:10)
music yeah and so you feel like you (25:08 - 25:12)
should be as hype as you were in that (25:10 - 25:14)
Stadium (25:12 - 25:15)
but you're like there's like four people (25:14 - 25:17)
watching us right yeah there's like more (25:15 - 25:18)
people are doing this except in one (25:17 - 25:21)
congestion yeah and sometimes just the (25:18 - 25:23)
Clapping is out of sync so they do this (25:21 - 25:25)
and then three seconds later you hear (25:23 - 25:27)
this odd clap in the middle of nowhere (25:25 - 25:29)
like what is happening (25:27 - 25:30)
I think this is why you you kind of when (25:29 - 25:33)
you do other things like the for you (25:30 - 25:36)
know in uh sun and moon when they had (25:33 - 25:38)
the the totems like they they're so (25:36 - 25:40)
different that you're not really (25:38 - 25:42)
comparing it to other things and being (25:40 - 25:43)
like Oh it's disappointing because it's (25:42 - 25:45)
just it's a different thing whereas and (25:43 - 25:47)
I'm not necessarily saying they should (25:45 - 25:48)
always do something different like I (25:47 - 25:51)
think it's it's it's fine to just do (25:48 - 25:53)
gyms if that's if that's not what you (25:51 - 25:54)
want to experiment with that's not what (25:53 - 25:56)
they were wanting to experiment with in (25:54 - 25:58)
this game that's fine (25:56 - 25:59)
um but it does give you that Advantage (25:58 - 26:00)
if you do something completely different (25:59 - 26:02)
that you're not going oh it's just not (26:00 - 26:04)
as good as the last one because that was (26:02 - 26:06)
really really good inside shield and the (26:04 - 26:09)
other thing I want to say overall about (26:06 - 26:10)
the gym (26:09 - 26:12)
the other sort of disappointing thing (26:10 - 26:15)
about gyms didn't feel that special (26:12 - 26:19)
but also the plot line that was about my (26:15 - 26:20)
character (26:19 - 26:23)
felt very flat like this is my story (26:20 - 26:24)
like (26:23 - 26:28)
path of Titans is Arpin story path of (26:24 - 26:31)
star is cassiopeia's story this is my (26:28 - 26:34)
story and it it is uh pretty much a (26:31 - 26:37)
straight boring line to the end like I (26:34 - 26:39)
meet some interesting people along the (26:37 - 26:42)
way but I did that in everyone I just (26:39 - 26:45)
felt like at some point I want them to (26:42 - 26:48)
incorporate a much deeper story into why (26:45 - 26:51)
I'm doing the gyms than this is just the (26:48 - 26:53)
gym challenge (26:51 - 26:53)
I mean I guess we talk about this next (26:54 - 26:59)
episode but I was very refreshed that (26:56 - 27:01)
there wasn't this like sense of like hey (26:59 - 27:03)
while you're doing the gym challenge (27:01 - 27:04)
just let you know the world is about to (27:03 - 27:07)
end there's a huge flower cannon um yeah (27:04 - 27:09)
but you know you go battle Pitbull real (27:07 - 27:10)
quick and then you know get get that (27:09 - 27:12)
Avila guy out of the way but when you (27:10 - 27:14)
would come back uh we got this that was (27:12 - 27:16)
to me that was like so refreshing and (27:14 - 27:18)
maybe it made it a little bit more (27:16 - 27:22)
boring but I I was like I was glad there (27:18 - 27:24)
wasn't this like (27:22 - 27:27)
Doom and Gloom like in the corner that I (27:24 - 27:29)
eventually I had to deal with I just (27:27 - 27:30)
felt like (27:29 - 27:32)
again I I understand what you're saying (27:30 - 27:34)
Greg like it comes across a little (27:32 - 27:36)
boring or a little stale but like to me (27:34 - 27:38)
it was like I can go at my I'm doing the (27:36 - 27:40)
gym leaders at my own pace I'm catching (27:38 - 27:42)
at my own pace I'm going over here I (27:40 - 27:44)
know that I gotta battle this person but (27:42 - 27:46)
I'll do that like tomorrow like it just (27:44 - 27:51)
felt so nice but like it it was nice I (27:46 - 27:52)
wanted the boring nice though right like (27:51 - 27:54)
I wanted the boring knife yeah it was (27:52 - 27:58)
it's nice to have them separate like I (27:54 - 28:00)
think that's fine (27:58 - 28:03)
but I wish I felt that as much thought (28:00 - 28:05)
was put into my journey the one that's (28:03 - 28:07)
about my character (28:05 - 28:09)
that was put into everybody else's and I (28:07 - 28:11)
think like (28:09 - 28:13)
I always reminds me like you complain (28:11 - 28:15)
about black and white being end stories (28:13 - 28:18)
yes like the one that's my story is as (28:15 - 28:21)
boring because I am not centered in this (28:18 - 28:23)
story much at all as a matter of fact a (28:21 - 28:25)
lot of my options are to be like I don't (28:23 - 28:27)
really know why I'm doing this like you (28:25 - 28:29)
can say I don't know is this what I want (28:27 - 28:32)
to be doing I don't know and that it (28:29 - 28:34)
felt that's just game free collecting (28:32 - 28:36)
feedback at that point but yeah it is (28:34 - 28:38)
but I felt like (28:36 - 28:42)
for once I want (28:38 - 28:47)
as much thought put into my choices as (28:42 - 28:50)
they put into NPC's choices I would like (28:47 - 28:53)
a thing where me taking on the gyms is (28:50 - 28:56)
affecting the world in a way that the (28:53 - 28:57)
other two plot lines were affecting the (28:56 - 28:59)
world instead it felt like a checklist (28:57 - 29:02)
to me and it's fine it's a nice break (28:59 - 29:04)
but I without the excitement of the (29:02 - 29:07)
stadiums and without sort of an (29:04 - 29:09)
additional character that was growing (29:07 - 29:11)
along with me because pneumonia is a (29:09 - 29:13)
great character but she's (29:11 - 29:15)
a straight line she's she's already (29:13 - 29:17)
there though that's the weird she's (29:15 - 29:18)
already there she did it she did it (29:17 - 29:21)
she's great she she's Unapologetic (29:18 - 29:24)
Unapologetic about who she is but (29:21 - 29:26)
there's no sense of growth for her and (29:24 - 29:28)
there's no sense of growth for me (29:26 - 29:31)
and that is my biggest sort of take away (29:28 - 29:36)
from the gym line is like I wish it was (29:31 - 29:39)
more about me and had a bigger effect on (29:36 - 29:41)
the world (29:39 - 29:43)
I think that's totally fair and this is (29:41 - 29:45)
not justifying it um because I think (29:43 - 29:46)
you're right I think that there does (29:45 - 29:48)
need to be more into it but I I suspect (29:46 - 29:50)
the reasoning this is happening is (29:48 - 29:53)
because they are still very much in the (29:50 - 29:54)
mindset of this as a role-playing game (29:53 - 29:57)
you are playing uh but you're from your (29:54 - 29:59)
point of view right they've always had (29:57 - 30:01)
they've always been of the you are (29:59 - 30:04)
playing you and we're not going to put a (30:01 - 30:07)
story on you you are going to create (30:04 - 30:09)
your own adventure through this and (30:07 - 30:11)
there are stories that other people have (30:09 - 30:14)
and like you are helping through their (30:11 - 30:15)
stories and through the world stories (30:14 - 30:19)
but they've never really had like a (30:15 - 30:21)
story for the main character except (30:19 - 30:25)
maybe in the like the red in gold and (30:21 - 30:27)
silver storyline which is a little bit (30:25 - 30:29)
odd in it in and of itself (30:27 - 30:31)
um but other than that they've never (30:29 - 30:33)
really gone like there is a story for (30:31 - 30:34)
the main character because it's you and (30:33 - 30:36)
you are making the story (30:34 - 30:37)
um and I suspect they're kind of still (30:36 - 30:39)
stuck in that but they're trying to do (30:37 - 30:41)
more around other things and so because (30:39 - 30:44)
they've kind of elevated that in the (30:41 - 30:47)
other areas of the stories you're you're (30:44 - 30:50)
almost you're seeing the lack of story (30:47 - 30:54)
more for the main character yeah I I (30:50 - 30:56)
think (30:54 - 31:00)
I do think there is a fine line of (30:56 - 31:02)
this is your character and these are the (31:00 - 31:05)
choices that you make and (31:02 - 31:07)
if other series hadn't already tackled (31:05 - 31:09)
that sort of branching decision choices (31:07 - 31:14)
particularly well 10 15 years ago I (31:09 - 31:16)
could I could give it a little bit more (31:14 - 31:17)
leeway and I give it a little bit more (31:16 - 31:20)
because they are very conservative (31:17 - 31:22)
company right they take the absolute (31:20 - 31:25)
babyest of baby steps at every chance (31:22 - 31:28)
they can I'm just saying we have seen (31:25 - 31:31)
this happen very well in other things (31:28 - 31:33)
they did the other story lines pretty (31:31 - 31:36)
well in this one it's just that when it (31:33 - 31:39)
came to me and my character my my my (31:36 - 31:42)
options were enthusiastically into this (31:39 - 31:45)
or enthusiastically not into this gym (31:42 - 31:47)
challenge these are my branches and no (31:45 - 31:49)
matter what I picked the ending was (31:47 - 31:50)
becoming the same (31:49 - 31:52)
and I think that's a bit of a disservice (31:50 - 31:56)
to me as the player and my story (31:52 - 31:59)
I think I think the way I think Alice (31:56 - 32:00)
right (31:59 - 32:03)
um this might be the the yeah it took us (32:00 - 32:05)
four podcasts I'll start to agree with (32:03 - 32:06)
each other (32:05 - 32:09)
um I think I think Alice correct I I (32:06 - 32:11)
wonder if and and I see that point right (32:09 - 32:13)
you see that in other games uh like you (32:11 - 32:16)
know as much as uh here where where we (32:13 - 32:17)
didn't we didn't hit our breath of the (32:16 - 32:19)
wild quota 32 minutes in breath of the (32:17 - 32:22)
wild right like every every Zelda game (32:19 - 32:24)
like link doesn't have a voice right and (32:22 - 32:25)
Nintendo has came out and said like the (32:24 - 32:27)
reason link doesn't have a voice is is (32:25 - 32:28)
it's supposed to be you and it's (32:27 - 32:29)
supposed to be your journey right that's (32:28 - 32:32)
why we don't give link a voice (32:29 - 32:34)
um and you could apply the same thing to (32:32 - 32:35)
a lot of video games (32:34 - 32:37)
in this case Pokemon like your character (32:35 - 32:39)
doesn't really speak and it's your (32:37 - 32:41)
journey and you're supposed to do it I I (32:39 - 32:44)
wonder if they you know the questions (32:41 - 32:46)
that they have you answer and I think (32:44 - 32:48)
the question stuff really started in in (32:46 - 32:50)
like X and Y where they started asking a (32:48 - 32:52)
couple questions and then in Sun and (32:50 - 32:54)
Moon they are asking you more questions (32:52 - 32:55)
and then Galler they were asking you (32:54 - 32:57)
more questions and like Greg said none (32:55 - 32:59)
of those questions matter except they (32:57 - 33:01)
probably do like game freak knows how (32:59 - 33:02)
many people are picking you know what (33:01 - 33:04)
questions (33:02 - 33:07)
um it would almost be nice and that if (33:04 - 33:10)
if depending on your performance (33:07 - 33:13)
uh you know what you're doing eight gyms (33:10 - 33:15)
you're doing four that that would at (33:13 - 33:18)
least change your experience to make it (33:15 - 33:20)
feel slightly different yeah um and I (33:18 - 33:21)
think maybe that's why some people have (33:20 - 33:25)
a problem with a gita's team is because (33:21 - 33:28)
if you moved one Pokemon on gita's team (33:25 - 33:32)
around her whole strategy becomes so (33:28 - 33:35)
dramatically different and better and if (33:32 - 33:38)
they use that information to like (33:35 - 33:40)
literally make one get like one choice (33:38 - 33:42)
at the end you would have a different (33:40 - 33:44)
Champion battle and it would have (33:42 - 33:46)
probably been (33:44 - 33:49)
at it harder or at least different and (33:46 - 33:51)
the other thing is I think (33:49 - 33:54)
they they laid the ground a little bit (33:51 - 33:56)
in this one and they I think they still (33:54 - 33:58)
did it better than sword and shield that (33:56 - 34:00)
as you went through each gym more and (33:58 - 34:03)
more of the NPCs began to know who you (34:00 - 34:07)
were yeah and they had that a tiny bit (34:03 - 34:09)
in this one but again it felt diminished (34:07 - 34:12)
from what they did in the last game it (34:09 - 34:14)
felt like a step back to me and I'm like (34:12 - 34:17)
no I'm I'm doing this I'm I am this (34:14 - 34:20)
person that you all talk about I am (34:17 - 34:23)
easily as good as she is like and only (34:20 - 34:27)
the people in this path care and that I (34:23 - 34:29)
think also is another weird thing is (34:27 - 34:31)
like only people who are following this (34:29 - 34:32)
track seem to care (34:31 - 34:35)
like and that's fine but again this is (34:32 - 34:38)
my story and it felt diminished in the (34:35 - 34:39)
world (34:38 - 34:40)
it also doesn't help that you're so (34:39 - 34:42)
generic as a character right right and I (34:40 - 34:44)
can't just like a model like you have (34:42 - 34:46)
the exact same clothes as everyone else (34:44 - 34:49)
oh great you can wear a different hat (34:46 - 34:51)
there there was one part in the game (34:49 - 34:52)
where I was like oh maybe they're doing (34:51 - 34:54)
something different uh which is (34:52 - 34:57)
um like like I I said I ran through the (34:54 - 34:58)
tutorial as fast as possible so when I (34:57 - 35:02)
got to the the gate to fight nimona (34:58 - 35:04)
pneumonia (35:02 - 35:07)
um I only had quaxley and then you know (35:04 - 35:08)
she had three Pokemon and then she (35:07 - 35:10)
teracolizes and then she like smoked me (35:08 - 35:12)
and I was like oh okay cool you know (35:10 - 35:14)
I'll just catch two Pokemon and like you (35:12 - 35:15)
know I'll just finish up this battle (35:14 - 35:17)
real quick but she doesn't actually (35:15 - 35:19)
battle you there's no rematch if you (35:17 - 35:22)
lose you lose and I and it's kind of (35:19 - 35:23)
weird that like (35:22 - 35:26)
there's very few instances of that (35:23 - 35:30)
throughout the 26 years of Pokemon (35:26 - 35:32)
um which which I think is really weird (35:30 - 35:36)
because like that could that that's just (35:32 - 35:39)
an easy story beat to incorporate in (35:36 - 35:42)
your game like of like if you lose here (35:39 - 35:46)
uh also I I guess I didn't know this (35:42 - 35:47)
until I asked the question to a bunch of (35:46 - 35:49)
people apparently people still like turn (35:47 - 35:51)
their game off when they lose like and (35:49 - 35:53)
they like reset which is like oh that (35:51 - 35:55)
really yeah I did it's like that I was (35:53 - 35:57)
like this is just a battle that she can (35:55 - 35:59)
do a thing that I can't (35:57 - 36:02)
I mean I ultimately won but I was like (35:59 - 36:03)
oh (36:02 - 36:07)
interesting like like why would I I (36:03 - 36:09)
often didn't change when I lost against (36:07 - 36:12)
the Rival and Professor Oaks (36:09 - 36:14)
thing either because it's like (36:12 - 36:16)
I am low level and I don't have (36:14 - 36:18)
everything yet (36:16 - 36:21)
and it's random chance at that point (36:18 - 36:23)
really do I have a good match up and hit (36:21 - 36:27)
the level enough like it I I was like oh (36:23 - 36:28)
this is the first battle before the game (36:27 - 36:30)
really starts and I didn't think about (36:28 - 36:32)
restarting (36:30 - 36:35)
I would restart and so I restart if I (36:32 - 36:38)
have like got through two or three (36:35 - 36:39)
members of the Elite Four I'll save at (36:38 - 36:41)
that point and if I lose the next one (36:39 - 36:42)
I'll restart because I'm like I know I (36:41 - 36:44)
can defeat the other ones I don't really (36:42 - 36:46)
care Oh unless I'm like severely under (36:44 - 36:50)
leveled right but but yeah but like you (36:46 - 36:51)
lose a little bit of money when you lose (36:50 - 36:54)
but you also gain the experience (36:51 - 36:54)
why would you why would you reset for (36:54 - 36:58)
all those other ones it's weird that the (36:57 - 37:00)
the punishment is still like lose money (36:58 - 37:03)
because if you're losing don't you need (37:00 - 37:05)
that money to like buy like a revive or (37:03 - 37:08)
a potion it it's such a weird (37:05 - 37:10)
that's how the gym leaders make their (37:08 - 37:13)
money by doing it it's not paying them (37:10 - 37:17)
uh okay so brassius's challenge was find (37:13 - 37:20)
the sunfloras which I think was I like (37:17 - 37:21)
that one probably the most well for me (37:20 - 37:23)
it was fine the robots (37:21 - 37:27)
because oh yeah it moved so janky and (37:23 - 37:30)
the more I added the worse it got and (37:27 - 37:33)
I'm like I I had to look up (37:30 - 37:35)
to be able to move forward so that I was (37:33 - 37:37)
not looking at a sea of janky moving (37:35 - 37:40)
sunflora who were sprinting up behind me (37:37 - 37:42)
pretty smooth but I I do I'm aware that (37:40 - 37:45)
everyone else is ran oh it was so bad (37:42 - 37:48)
and I was so frustrated you just have to (37:45 - 37:50)
wait till it doesn't rain in the town (37:48 - 37:53)
and then you start it because once it (37:50 - 37:55)
starts raining it's all downhill I like (37:53 - 37:57)
the sunflower thing (37:55 - 38:00)
um and then iona's uh was the uh like (37:57 - 38:04)
where's Waldo thing yep and I liked in (38:00 - 38:06)
that situation like she pops up on the (38:04 - 38:08)
screen like like a streamer in the (38:06 - 38:11)
corner yeah yeah and hers again I think (38:08 - 38:14)
out of all the gym leaders whoever was (38:11 - 38:16)
in charge of her I felt like put so much (38:14 - 38:20)
love and care into her entire gym thing (38:16 - 38:23)
like hers just stands out you get to (38:20 - 38:26)
Russia and you're like did they not care (38:23 - 38:29)
and then here it's just like from from (38:26 - 38:31)
the Pokemon she uses from her strategy (38:29 - 38:33)
from her Tara from her gym challenge it (38:31 - 38:35)
just seemed like (38:33 - 38:38)
they cared for her yeah and they didn't (38:35 - 38:40)
apply that to some other ones (38:38 - 38:42)
it felt like the most in character (38:40 - 38:43)
certainly (38:42 - 38:44)
um and it wasn't particularly (38:43 - 38:46)
challenging you know especially as if (38:44 - 38:48)
you don't get it really quickly it (38:46 - 38:51)
basically tells you how to solve it (38:48 - 38:53)
um but it was certainly it was it was (38:51 - 38:56)
fun certainly I I I (38:53 - 38:59)
see I don't identify with I don't know (38:56 - 39:00)
at all because she just came across as (38:59 - 39:02)
super super young and super super (39:00 - 39:05)
annoying and I'm like oh you're just (39:02 - 39:07)
you're well also I watch a lot of anime (39:05 - 39:09)
and I'm like I am so tired of this (39:07 - 39:13)
character type I get off my screen get (39:09 - 39:15)
away from me I am done I know what your (39:13 - 39:17)
voice is I can hear it in my head it's (39:15 - 39:19)
annoying and I'm done dealing with you (39:17 - 39:21)
yeah I mean that was that was the (39:19 - 39:22)
trailer you know some people really (39:21 - 39:23)
connected with her right away and some (39:22 - 39:25)
people were like I don't want I do not (39:23 - 39:29)
want but soon they would remedy my lack (39:25 - 39:31)
of representation in the entire Pokemon (39:29 - 39:37)
world so after Yono would be kofu yep (39:31 - 39:42)
um which uh he has a uh uh valuza this (39:37 - 39:44)
thing is how you say it wug Trio and a (39:42 - 39:48)
krabam crabominable I can never say this (39:44 - 39:51)
one it's been like six years (39:48 - 39:51)
um which (39:52 - 39:57)
the this is where like I was like ah (39:54 - 40:00)
yeah the terror type's like okay I mean (39:57 - 40:02)
you have a crap so the the the the (40:00 - 40:06)
reason why his Aces is the crab is so it (40:02 - 40:08)
finally it's it's fighting ice it (40:06 - 40:10)
finally gets water type and then it can (40:08 - 40:14)
take advantage of crab Hammer as a stab (40:10 - 40:15)
which would do an immense amount of (40:14 - 40:18)
damage so like (40:15 - 40:21)
yeah okay so like fine thematically you (40:18 - 40:22)
you hit the check you hit that little (40:21 - 40:24)
check box uh (40:22 - 40:25)
um (40:24 - 40:27)
this assuming you don't one shot it (40:25 - 40:30)
because it's very slowly meet my olive (40:27 - 40:31)
tree (40:30 - 40:33)
drink drink drink (40:31 - 40:35)
this this is the point where I kicked my (40:33 - 40:38)
wug tree off the team uh because it's (40:35 - 40:40)
just what trio I try to make him work (40:38 - 40:42)
this is not great (40:40 - 40:44)
um (40:42 - 40:47)
I liked him I I heard from a lot of (40:44 - 40:49)
people they they they liked him more the (40:47 - 40:51)
I felt like you know if Larry didn't (40:49 - 40:54)
exist you know kofu would maybe be like (40:51 - 40:56)
a top two for people uh he was okay uh (40:54 - 40:58)
like he's like what what was his gimmick (40:56 - 41:02)
he was like also a cook yeah (40:58 - 41:02)
um like the wallet thing was like okay (41:03 - 41:06)
that was like that was the challenge (41:05 - 41:08)
right it's just like they turned as well (41:06 - 41:10)
and the challenge was do our dumb (41:08 - 41:12)
auction system (41:10 - 41:15)
oh yeah hold on hold on hold on you (41:12 - 41:16)
don't like the auction system no I don't (41:15 - 41:18)
I think I think it is one of the best (41:16 - 41:20)
things they put in the entire game I (41:18 - 41:22)
absolutely adore the auction system I (41:20 - 41:24)
think it's so fun I look forward to it (41:22 - 41:26)
every day I mean I just it's just a it's (41:24 - 41:28)
just another randomized thing that (41:26 - 41:30)
digging paw and digging mom was and like (41:28 - 41:32)
the Isle of armor where wait is this a (41:30 - 41:34)
thing that you can get elsewhere like (41:32 - 41:36)
this isn't just a one-off thing no the (41:34 - 41:38)
options that's like multiple times a day (41:36 - 41:39)
yeah there's three auctions and I think (41:38 - 41:42)
it resets like every like in-game days (41:39 - 41:44)
it like resets that's how you get love (41:42 - 41:48)
ball to Moon ball like it gives you a (41:44 - 41:49)
reason to like save your money because (41:48 - 41:52)
when a dream ball shows up in there like (41:49 - 41:54)
the other characters also care about it (41:52 - 41:55)
so like a dream ball or a moon ball like (41:54 - 41:59)
they'll go for like 200k so like like (41:55 - 42:00)
you kind of have a reason to like (41:59 - 42:03)
stockpile money and put the money (42:00 - 42:04)
somewhere (42:03 - 42:06)
um so like again it gives you a reason (42:04 - 42:08)
to check it because it's like oh a rare (42:06 - 42:10)
ball could be here and I could bid on it (42:08 - 42:11)
because I get a certain point like (42:10 - 42:13)
you're not gonna really need to bid on (42:11 - 42:17)
like carbos or or pokeballs or like Lepa (42:13 - 42:18)
berries right at a certain point you're (42:17 - 42:20)
going to have so many of those or just (42:18 - 42:21)
not need those so the fact that the (42:20 - 42:24)
auction runs like the rare balls every (42:21 - 42:27)
now and then is like holy cow like I'm I (42:24 - 42:29)
I'm I will throw as much money as (42:27 - 42:32)
possible to get a dream ball as a luxury (42:29 - 42:34)
Ball Trainer only (42:32 - 42:37)
I will not bid over what market price (42:34 - 42:40)
would be for those balls so as we (42:37 - 42:42)
approach market price if it's about to (42:40 - 42:45)
go over have it I'm not paying for this (42:42 - 42:48)
I I live in the lap of luxury with (42:45 - 42:50)
luxury balls these are just nice (42:48 - 42:54)
souvenirs I do not need any of this this (42:50 - 42:56)
system one of my first auctions was like (42:54 - 42:59)
90 Premiere balls and I was like this is (42:56 - 43:01)
fantastic because I don't have to buy (42:59 - 43:02)
Pokeballs to get from your balls and (43:01 - 43:04)
then sell them back and I got them I'm (43:02 - 43:07)
definitely under price too (43:04 - 43:09)
yeah I'm definitely Premier Ball and so (43:07 - 43:11)
yeah constantly spending ridiculous (43:09 - 43:13)
amounts of money to buy hundreds of (43:11 - 43:15)
balls and then sell them all again yeah (43:13 - 43:16)
yeah so when you when you log into (43:15 - 43:18)
scarlet and violet like most people I (43:16 - 43:19)
think probably check their outbreaks or (43:18 - 43:21)
check what like six star raids are (43:19 - 43:23)
happening but yeah you should check the (43:21 - 43:25)
auction like before I will try that I (43:23 - 43:27)
just assumed it was a random just just (43:25 - 43:29)
this challenge like all the other ones (43:27 - 43:31)
you know there are there are some other (43:29 - 43:34)
things there but I I just (43:31 - 43:37)
it's like okay I don't really need any (43:34 - 43:38)
of this so (43:37 - 43:40)
foreign (43:38 - 43:44)
the next gym leader would be Larry the (43:40 - 43:46)
greatest gym leader that has ever (43:44 - 43:48)
existed (43:46 - 43:51)
Larry and I (43:48 - 43:54)
are soul mates Larry and I understand (43:51 - 43:57)
each other on a deep personal level I (43:54 - 43:59)
too am exhausted (43:57 - 44:02)
and can only do things on my lunch break (43:59 - 44:04)
including fighting other trainers I (44:02 - 44:09)
understand and I appreciate Larry deeply (44:04 - 44:09)
um (44:09 - 44:11)
I think his gym challenge was pretty (44:09 - 44:13)
thought out yeah like you could you (44:11 - 44:15)
could hard you could just Brute Force (44:13 - 44:17)
hard guess it right (44:15 - 44:19)
um which I know some people did I mean (44:17 - 44:20)
what is it like I would take quite a (44:19 - 44:22)
while (44:20 - 44:25)
it's like three questions of three and (44:22 - 44:28)
then a question of two and he he gives (44:25 - 44:29)
you the final answer right like he says (44:28 - 44:31)
Dash he's the one that gives you like (44:29 - 44:33)
dash of lemon yep um (44:31 - 44:35)
here's the other thing here's the other (44:33 - 44:37)
thing (44:35 - 44:39)
clearly people are eating in that dining (44:37 - 44:40)
room (44:39 - 44:43)
where do they go oh they suddenly they (44:40 - 44:45)
died right like yeah they all they all (44:43 - 44:47)
got dumped into the acid pit below the (44:45 - 44:48)
whole thing twisted and they were like (44:47 - 44:52)
see ya thanks for your money Chumps get (44:48 - 44:53)
into the dungeon (44:52 - 44:55)
I find the challenge in the gym (44:53 - 44:57)
memorable for this one but I had (44:55 - 44:59)
completely forgotten it was Larry when I (44:57 - 45:01)
was looking at this list in preparation (44:59 - 45:02)
for this episode I was like oh (45:01 - 45:04)
oh (45:02 - 45:06)
he was not gym leader okay Larry is the (45:04 - 45:07)
best (45:06 - 45:09)
I talk about Larry to a lot of people I (45:07 - 45:12)
love Larry so so Larry has a Kamala uh (45:09 - 45:16)
the Dunsparce and a star Raptor (45:12 - 45:18)
um (45:16 - 45:23)
this Terror type normal star Raptor like (45:18 - 45:26)
I it's no longer weak to Electric I I (45:23 - 45:29)
guess yeah but it's it's it's now weak (45:26 - 45:31)
to fighting which is what you already (45:29 - 45:35)
had right and it was like oh stupid (45:31 - 45:38)
example yeah Larry Lara is probably the (45:35 - 45:41)
worst Tara but like also he comes across (45:38 - 45:43)
as like he doesn't care right like he (45:41 - 45:45)
doesn't care this is just Larry's Tara (45:43 - 45:47)
was the greatest because also (45:45 - 45:50)
you're like oh right (45:47 - 45:54)
he has a he has a flying move (45:50 - 45:56)
oh that's right all right I just need to (45:54 - 45:58)
change this up just just a quick second (45:56 - 46:00)
that was the only one that was like oh (45:58 - 46:02)
yeah my Fighter's out there and it's (46:00 - 46:04)
been slowed down (46:02 - 46:06)
sometimes I do this I I don't remember (46:04 - 46:08)
when I started doing this (46:06 - 46:10)
um it might have been black and white (46:08 - 46:13)
but they'll give certain Pokemon only (46:10 - 46:14)
like two or three moves they even though (46:13 - 46:16)
like Star Raptor at this point level 36 (46:14 - 46:20)
should could easily have four moves they (46:16 - 46:22)
they specifically give (46:20 - 46:25)
the star Raptor and this isn't exclusive (46:22 - 46:28)
to Larry this is for a bunch of Pokemon (46:25 - 46:32)
um so Raptor only has uh uh facade and (46:28 - 46:33)
air release (46:32 - 46:36)
so if you burn it or paralyze it it's (46:33 - 46:38)
gonna do double damage and then (46:36 - 46:39)
aerialace (46:38 - 46:43)
so you would think that having uh two (46:39 - 46:45)
moves would be a disadvantage but it (46:43 - 46:46)
actually (46:45 - 46:49)
it's less (46:46 - 46:52)
mistakes the AI could randomly like pick (46:49 - 46:54)
right (46:52 - 46:55)
uh (46:54 - 46:58)
which ends up you know if if area laces (46:55 - 47:03)
never misses and this has stab and (46:58 - 47:04)
I think is what base 60 or something (47:03 - 47:05)
maybe High chance for credit I can't (47:04 - 47:08)
remember I realize just knows a Miss (47:05 - 47:10)
um him spamming that over and over is is (47:08 - 47:11)
effective especially if you're using (47:10 - 47:14)
fighting Pokemon (47:11 - 47:16)
uh but yeah no like (47:14 - 47:18)
I don't think I've I I don't think I've (47:16 - 47:20)
met a person who doesn't like Larry and (47:18 - 47:21)
if they don't I would be very (47:20 - 47:23)
questionable of like (47:21 - 47:26)
just a minute you don't like your dad (47:23 - 47:29)
I mean I don't like my dad that's true (47:26 - 47:32)
but I like Larry yeah I mean if you (47:29 - 47:33)
don't like Larry you don't like your dad (47:32 - 47:35)
that is the thing go to a therapist (47:33 - 47:37)
yeah I mean when I when I said that I'd (47:35 - 47:38)
forgotten it was lied for the record (47:37 - 47:40)
that's not me saying I dislike Larry (47:38 - 47:42)
that's just I'd forgotten because of (47:40 - 47:45)
what happens later with Larry oh sure (47:42 - 47:46)
sure (47:45 - 47:48)
uh yeah don't Larry Larry is really (47:46 - 47:49)
great (47:48 - 47:52)
uh so next after this we're supposed to (47:49 - 47:54)
have rhyme although I think the end of (47:52 - 47:55)
this game people get things out of order (47:54 - 47:58)
or whatever dude whatever you want but (47:55 - 48:00)
like rhyme is literally five steps away (47:58 - 48:02)
from Russia correct (48:00 - 48:05)
look they're right next to each other uh (48:02 - 48:07)
rhyme is a double battle (48:05 - 48:07)
yes (48:08 - 48:14)
Prime that this is not voice acted yeah (48:10 - 48:17)
oh yeah yeah this is disappears second (48:14 - 48:19)
crime okay crime that this is way (48:17 - 48:22)
targeted when they gave Roxy a song (48:19 - 48:25)
in black and white too (48:22 - 48:27)
yeah they don't have one here second (48:25 - 48:29)
crime is the fact that her full name is (48:27 - 48:31)
Rhyme Time and I will never forgive that (48:29 - 48:34)
ever (48:31 - 48:36)
I don't wait why (48:34 - 48:39)
it's bad prime time I get out of here (48:36 - 48:44)
this was cringe to me not because she's (48:39 - 48:46)
a rapper like cool like (48:44 - 48:51)
that's it I I just don't like the (48:46 - 48:55)
hey do a rap off with me why like like I (48:51 - 48:56)
I like (48:55 - 48:59)
I'm just here to battle you like the (48:56 - 49:01)
whole like do you want a rap do you want (48:59 - 49:04)
to hang out like hear my sick beats like (49:01 - 49:06)
we're not in performance mode anymore (49:04 - 49:08)
you did that I just want to battle you (49:06 - 49:12)
like I think the writing and like (49:08 - 49:14)
everything is good I think her as a (49:12 - 49:16)
character is good it's just like when (49:14 - 49:18)
I'm putting myself in that situation (49:16 - 49:20)
it's kind of like when I go by the way I (49:18 - 49:21)
got a haircut for the the audio people (49:20 - 49:23)
it's like when when I go get a haircut (49:21 - 49:26)
and they just want to talk to you it's (49:23 - 49:28)
like I'm I'm here for one thing just cut (49:26 - 49:29)
my hair (49:28 - 49:32)
I'm sure some other people are here for (49:29 - 49:35)
the conversation I'm not yeah people (49:32 - 49:37)
people who like talking to people and (49:35 - 49:39)
don't treat people like the help (49:37 - 49:41)
uh are generally is viewed as nice (49:39 - 49:43)
people but when you go in and like do (49:41 - 49:46)
not speak to me peasant do my hair thing (49:43 - 49:49)
it never speak to me again (49:46 - 49:52)
how dare you speak to me your king am I (49:49 - 49:57)
not paying you to be quiet I have begged (49:52 - 50:00)
you to be quiet I will tip more if you (49:57 - 50:03)
don't have this awkward cover just cut (50:00 - 50:05)
my hair so when I got it right at the (50:03 - 50:07)
annals people (50:05 - 50:10)
cannot be bothered to talk to the little (50:07 - 50:13)
people who are doing him a service (50:10 - 50:15)
hey hairdressers (50:13 - 50:17)
you know what to do with his hair going (50:15 - 50:18)
forward (50:17 - 50:20)
so when I got to rhyme I was just like (50:18 - 50:24)
just battle me I don't need this huge (50:20 - 50:27)
rap battle uh but I think I think to (50:24 - 50:29)
what Greg said like (50:27 - 50:32)
not without without any voice acting (50:29 - 50:34)
you're just like this comes off even (50:32 - 50:37)
more Awkward than it should yeah it felt (50:34 - 50:39)
really awkward without like voice acting (50:37 - 50:42)
I'm like oh (50:39 - 50:44)
hmm (50:42 - 50:48)
uh she's a double battle uh ghost (50:44 - 50:49)
um this is literally like the only (50:48 - 50:52)
double battle in the entire game I can't (50:49 - 50:53)
think of another one I don't think (50:52 - 50:55)
there's another one which is like weird (50:53 - 50:59)
that like not even trainers on a route I (50:55 - 51:02)
don't I don't know it's so it's not even (50:59 - 51:04)
like I want more double battles I don't (51:02 - 51:07)
really care right like I I I feel like I (51:04 - 51:08)
can't (51:07 - 51:10)
uh and we we haven't talked about this (51:08 - 51:12)
but I feel like the trainers on the (51:10 - 51:14)
routes are the weakest part of the game (51:12 - 51:17)
right so like the trainers having double (51:14 - 51:18)
battles wouldn't have saved that that's (51:17 - 51:19)
not the solution that doesn't make it (51:18 - 51:21)
better having more gym leaders have (51:19 - 51:23)
double battles I don't think also like (51:21 - 51:26)
fix is the issue it's I think the the (51:23 - 51:28)
conversation maybe we'll have for a (51:26 - 51:30)
future show is like (51:28 - 51:32)
when when game freak introduced double (51:30 - 51:35)
battles in Ruby and Sapphire they (51:32 - 51:38)
they're everywhere they're they're on so (51:35 - 51:39)
many routes there's at least like one (51:38 - 51:41)
double battle (51:39 - 51:43)
um and obviously they did the gym and (51:41 - 51:46)
then it seemed like since then they just (51:43 - 51:48)
cut back and cut back and cut back to (51:46 - 51:50)
the point where in this game (51:48 - 51:51)
I think she's like the only double (51:50 - 51:53)
battle and I think the weird thing is (51:51 - 51:56)
like it's not weird double battles make (51:53 - 51:57)
sense for competitive just because (51:56 - 51:59)
they're more interesting to watch and (51:57 - 52:01)
there's way more things that can happen (51:59 - 52:04)
um and it's not a 45 minute rapid spin (52:01 - 52:06)
Stealth Rock Fest that is single battles (52:04 - 52:08)
uh (52:06 - 52:11)
I don't there's nowhere in post game to (52:08 - 52:13)
like do double battles right like that's (52:11 - 52:16)
kind of the weird thing is yeah I don't (52:13 - 52:19)
remember any so anyways I I wonder what (52:16 - 52:21)
I wonder if they haven't figured out a (52:19 - 52:23)
better way to incorporate that because (52:21 - 52:26)
there is no battle tower in this game so (52:23 - 52:28)
at least in like they'll come in the DLC (52:26 - 52:29)
I'm sure yeah at least in sword and (52:28 - 52:31)
shield or sun and moon you could double (52:29 - 52:34)
battle in the The Towers (52:31 - 52:38)
um but uh her teams are fine like like (52:34 - 52:41)
I I don't know if anyone I I would (52:38 - 52:43)
assume that the difficulty isn't from (52:41 - 52:45)
her Pokemon Choice it's from like not (52:43 - 52:47)
understanding double battles right like (52:45 - 52:49)
that's that's pretty much it yeah I I (52:47 - 52:52)
blew through it (52:49 - 52:54)
yeah it wasn't particularly difficult um (52:52 - 52:58)
I think the the you I get your issues (52:54 - 52:59)
with the theming Steve but I think in (52:58 - 53:01)
general the theming was quite fun (52:59 - 53:04)
especially like you know at the end of (53:01 - 53:06)
the battle all the hiding Stone jump out (53:04 - 53:09)
of the ground yeah yeah no no (53:06 - 53:12)
she has the coolest town right like no (53:09 - 53:14)
no no debate like her town is the most (53:12 - 53:17)
memorable yeah her town is great the (53:14 - 53:18)
only memorable one I mean I still don't (53:17 - 53:20)
remember his name but (53:18 - 53:23)
yeah uh we have a tulip might actually (53:20 - 53:26)
be second best town because like tulip (53:23 - 53:29)
has that huge stadium in her or in her (53:26 - 53:32)
City also oh uh her her challenge was (53:29 - 53:33)
just like battle three people right like (53:32 - 53:35)
that was her yeah it was it wasn't like (53:33 - 53:37)
they like and this is where they start (53:35 - 53:38)
running out of like things today it was (53:37 - 53:40)
warm up the crowd by battle like these (53:38 - 53:44)
three people yeah okay uh so tulip (53:40 - 53:46)
um she has like the old Pokemon Sprites (53:44 - 53:48)
on her skin and her town is like (53:46 - 53:50)
actually really cool it's like on the (53:48 - 53:51)
mountain (53:50 - 53:53)
um it was great tulip (53:51 - 53:56)
tulip and I are besties and we go out to (53:53 - 53:58)
lunch all the time we have brunch we (53:56 - 54:00)
talk about how everybody else's are bad (53:58 - 54:03)
we talk about Steve how he treats uh the (54:00 - 54:06)
help the hair salon yeah and anybody he (54:03 - 54:08)
runs into apparently uh clearly just (54:06 - 54:11)
chat about that for like (54:08 - 54:13)
the here's the the most interesting (54:11 - 54:15)
thing about tulip is she tells you that (54:13 - 54:17)
she doesn't like Gita but doesn't tell (54:15 - 54:20)
you why yeah yeah which which I think is (54:17 - 54:22)
like (54:20 - 54:22)
Pokemon has stereotypes for their Gym (54:22 - 54:27)
Leaders they have like this is the (54:25 - 54:29)
musical gym leader this is the like (54:27 - 54:31)
artist gym leader and then they have (54:29 - 54:33)
like this is like the hot model (54:31 - 54:35)
fashionista gym leader tulip obviously (54:33 - 54:37)
falls under that (54:35 - 54:40)
um uh by the way her gym challenge is a (54:37 - 54:42)
complete scam you don't have to actually (54:40 - 54:46)
do it I I tested this so it's it's like (54:42 - 54:48)
a it's like a Simon says whatever yeah (54:46 - 54:51)
or like uh the world's slowest Simon (54:48 - 54:54)
says too I I purposely pressed the (54:51 - 54:56)
opposite button so if it's like blue (54:54 - 54:58)
I'll press green if it was red I'll (54:56 - 54:59)
press blue I did it and I pressed it (54:58 - 55:01)
over and over where you get like the (54:59 - 55:03)
failing sound I did it the entire (55:01 - 55:05)
Challenge and I still passed of course (55:03 - 55:08)
you cannot fail it it doesn't matter you (55:05 - 55:11)
could you could not press any button (55:08 - 55:13)
um which I don't whatever right like (55:11 - 55:16)
like I don't think I don't think there's (55:13 - 55:17)
a single person out there that was like (55:16 - 55:19)
oh I really struggled that moving that (55:17 - 55:21)
Olive like I I really wanted to battle (55:19 - 55:23)
Katie but the olive really like yeah I (55:21 - 55:24)
couldn't get the yellow part here's the (55:23 - 55:27)
thing it's ESP so they knew what you're (55:24 - 55:29)
really using (55:27 - 55:31)
um your choices don't matter because (55:29 - 55:35)
Free Will is an illusion yeah I mean (55:31 - 55:37)
like (55:35 - 55:37)
my my guess was they couldn't program it (55:38 - 55:45)
right so it doesn't matter what you do (55:41 - 55:47)
but there's my SAS Queen and we are (55:45 - 55:48)
going to go out to brunch and we're (55:47 - 55:50)
gonna talk about why we why we all don't (55:48 - 55:54)
like Rita oh sorry there's a lot there (55:50 - 55:58)
yeah I uh just just to point out uh (55:54 - 56:00)
Rhymes Pokemon were bayonet mimikyu (55:58 - 56:02)
houndstone toxicity (56:00 - 56:04)
um and then the toxicity turned to ghost (56:02 - 56:07)
uh (56:04 - 56:07)
uh the toxicity makes sense like I guess (56:07 - 56:12)
theming wise the toxicity makes sense (56:10 - 56:15)
because it's a music Pokemon I get it (56:12 - 56:17)
um battle-wise I'm not sure what it's (56:15 - 56:19)
specifically doing because it has hex (56:17 - 56:22)
and none of its Pokemon none of the (56:19 - 56:25)
Pokemon before it (56:22 - 56:29)
could set a status condition (56:25 - 56:32)
um and it has discharge and none of the (56:29 - 56:34)
Pokemon near it (56:32 - 56:37)
can absorb a electric type move so (56:34 - 56:39)
thematically I understand the toxicity (56:37 - 56:42)
uh in the battle (56:39 - 56:44)
there was there's no Synergy there and (56:42 - 56:47)
it loses its stab for (56:44 - 56:50)
the discharge (56:47 - 56:54)
uh okay so uh tulip has photograph (56:50 - 56:57)
Gardevoir uh spartha (56:54 - 56:59)
how do we say this (56:57 - 57:04)
isra and then a floor just (56:59 - 57:04)
I mean (57:05 - 57:09)
the the floor just is there thematically (57:06 - 57:13)
for like Beauty right yeah (57:09 - 57:17)
slide themes are great like I'm more (57:13 - 57:19)
into themes than I am for much of what (57:17 - 57:21)
they do with Gym Battles give me a solid (57:19 - 57:23)
theme and I'm there I mean her name is (57:21 - 57:26)
tulip and she ends with the flower so (57:23 - 57:27)
yeah (57:26 - 57:28)
um (57:27 - 57:30)
I mean that's an interesting spot they (57:28 - 57:33)
have done this in every game (57:30 - 57:35)
up till now and including this one is (57:33 - 57:38)
that the gyms are based around types (57:35 - 57:40)
um I I wonder whether that's something (57:38 - 57:43)
the like they feel wedded to that right (57:40 - 57:45)
like that feels like the starter types (57:43 - 57:47)
like they're never going to change that (57:45 - 57:50)
right right yeah right (57:47 - 57:52)
I think they never will change the (57:50 - 57:54)
starter types because no one knows how (57:52 - 57:57)
raids work it says fairy in the corner (57:54 - 58:01)
why are we bringing car ride on why (57:57 - 58:04)
because I love that Pokemon (58:01 - 58:04)
quit quit mocking my life choices uh (58:05 - 58:10)
okay and then finally we are ending with (58:09 - 58:14)
grusha who has a frost moth a bear tic (58:10 - 58:18)
acid Titan and an Altaria (58:14 - 58:22)
um Altaria losing dragon flying for ice (58:18 - 58:24)
um also presumably it's there just (58:22 - 58:26)
because it's white I don't know yeah I (58:24 - 58:28)
I'm not (58:26 - 58:30)
is it because like it's like like the (58:28 - 58:31)
altario is supposed to be like fluffy (58:30 - 58:33)
like snow yeah it's a big fluffy Cloud (58:31 - 58:36)
it's a cloud up in the mountains (58:33 - 58:38)
um like snow clouds don't tend to be (58:36 - 58:41)
white though this is the thing (58:38 - 58:43)
so we tend to do more gray (58:41 - 58:46)
the the complaints on top of a mountain (58:43 - 58:49)
in (58:46 - 58:51)
cover (58:49 - 58:54)
it's all white this is that's all it is (58:51 - 58:56)
just because Scotland has gray clouds (58:54 - 58:58)
doesn't mean the rest of the world does (58:56 - 59:00)
yeah no it's like the snow clouds are (58:58 - 59:02)
very they look very different (59:00 - 59:06)
they're not standard white fluffy (59:02 - 59:08)
Cloud you get lots of different types of (59:06 - 59:10)
clouds great they're not all the same I (59:08 - 59:13)
know okay okay so the complaint in sword (59:10 - 59:16)
and shield was Pierce's city correct I (59:13 - 59:19)
think everyone's in agreement yeah can I (59:16 - 59:21)
introduce you to crushers (59:19 - 59:23)
yeah what city (59:21 - 59:26)
nobody said it was a town it's it is a (59:23 - 59:29)
it is a ski resort that's the whole (59:26 - 59:32)
there's no resort yeah (59:29 - 59:37)
it's his it's his gym it is where is he (59:32 - 59:40)
is he living in the tower where you do (59:37 - 59:42)
the gym challenge yeah that thing is (59:40 - 59:44)
huge there's multiple levels and you (59:42 - 59:47)
don't even do anything in the building (59:44 - 59:49)
of course he's living on the upper (59:47 - 59:51)
levels (59:49 - 59:53)
yeah I guess (59:51 - 59:55)
it's literally (59:53 - 59:55)
just and there is cyclosaur everywhere (59:58 - 60:02)
I don't even think (60:01 - 60:06)
yeah okay uh (60:02 - 60:07)
I don't know if they can ever make an (60:06 - 60:11)
ice type gym hard because ice it just (60:07 - 60:14)
doesn't resist anything like ice is just (60:11 - 60:18)
so fresh like like I like ice Pokemon (60:14 - 60:19)
don't get me wrong there's a lot of (60:18 - 60:21)
Grace a great ice Pokemon out there but (60:19 - 60:22)
ice is (60:21 - 60:26)
one of the worst types ever probably on (60:22 - 60:27)
par with bug (60:26 - 60:30)
as just bad types now in this game they (60:27 - 60:32)
did change (60:30 - 60:32)
um how hail works it's now snow (60:33 - 60:39)
um but I don't even think (60:37 - 60:43)
does it default snow in the battle (60:39 - 60:46)
because none of his Pokemon set up snow (60:43 - 60:48)
yeah I believe it's snowing when you go (60:46 - 60:49)
into the battle (60:48 - 60:52)
so it's so snow should be up I don't (60:49 - 60:54)
even remember that if it if it was up I (60:52 - 60:56)
I didn't notice (60:54 - 60:59)
think it was the thing is is like the (60:56 - 61:01)
weird thing is (60:59 - 61:04)
like a lot of people bring fire type and (61:01 - 61:06)
there is a Pokemon that can deal with (61:04 - 61:08)
that is an ice type there's an ice (61:06 - 61:11)
dragon that that does have an ability to (61:08 - 61:15)
deal with fire and it's not on his team (61:11 - 61:15)
yeah I mean like if you're bringing fire (61:15 - 61:19)
type you have like the bear tick with (61:17 - 61:22)
AquaJet bear tick with earthquake (61:19 - 61:26)
um so Titan has liquidation (61:22 - 61:26)
um (61:27 - 61:29)
yeah I I mean I like Russia as a (61:29 - 61:32)
character (61:31 - 61:35)
yeah but they they do the thing that (61:32 - 61:37)
they do with most of the 8th gym leaders (61:35 - 61:39)
which is like (61:37 - 61:40)
all right you defeated me uh to the (61:39 - 61:45)
Elite Four you go like go go move on (61:40 - 61:45)
um (61:47 - 61:51)
yeah I I guess I I wanted more out of (61:48 - 61:52)
his (61:51 - 61:55)
uh yeah I mean like I I don't know as an (61:52 - 61:56)
eighth gym leader to have like nothing (61:55 - 61:59)
in their town and I get it it's like you (61:56 - 62:00)
know up on the top of the mountain and (61:59 - 62:03)
stuff it just kind of felt very like (62:00 - 62:05)
even if I wanted to distract myself (62:03 - 62:07)
there's nothing here it's just you walk (62:05 - 62:10)
in you walk out like that's it there's a (62:07 - 62:11)
ski slope (62:10 - 62:13)
also his gym challenge is the worst one (62:11 - 62:16)
right like (62:13 - 62:19)
it like it's so bad it's like you you (62:16 - 62:22)
take your karate on every ride on down (62:19 - 62:23)
the hill (62:22 - 62:26)
I thought it was fun oh I hated it I (62:23 - 62:29)
loved it it was fun I got to ski I'm a (62:26 - 62:32)
skier see this and this is my issue is I (62:29 - 62:34)
ran at like three frames a second all (62:32 - 62:36)
the way down like you might have had a (62:34 - 62:38)
bad experience with your sunflora Greg (62:36 - 62:41)
but this this is my bad experience was (62:38 - 62:43)
really smooth for me yeah no this was (62:41 - 62:46)
like this (62:43 - 62:46)
this is like the slowest Avalanche in (62:48 - 62:53)
the entire world as I went down this (62:51 - 62:56)
mountain (62:53 - 62:56)
in a sense honestly (62:57 - 63:00)
you know overall (63:02 - 63:05)
I like all the gym leaders I don't think (63:05 - 63:11)
this game provides the strongest eight (63:08 - 63:14)
gym leaders out there but I by no means (63:11 - 63:17)
think it's the weakest eight no um that (63:14 - 63:19)
they've that they've ever done (63:17 - 63:21)
I think I think the weakness is in their (63:19 - 63:23)
the way they always do with gym leaders (63:21 - 63:25)
where there's not a huge amount extra (63:23 - 63:27)
around them right once you're finished (63:25 - 63:28)
with them you're finished with them (63:27 - 63:30)
there's there's very few cases in in (63:28 - 63:33)
Pokemon where you have anything to do (63:30 - 63:34)
with the gym leaders after you've (63:33 - 63:36)
defeated them uh and that's that's the (63:34 - 63:38)
weak point which is just them continuing (63:36 - 63:40)
what they've done right decades now I I (63:38 - 63:42)
just really wish there was more around (63:40 - 63:46)
the gym stories I like (63:42 - 63:48)
at least in black and white the gym (63:46 - 63:50)
leaders would show up everyone's around (63:48 - 63:53)
the outside world and again here like a (63:50 - 63:55)
lot of them they are just locked into (63:53 - 63:57)
their one little part and you never see (63:55 - 63:59)
them again hey to be fair kofu ran to a (63:57 - 64:01)
different town (63:59 - 64:04)
once you chase him back he's like well I (64:01 - 64:06)
guess I live here forever again bye I (64:04 - 64:07)
mean black black and white I think is (64:06 - 64:09)
the is the exception because they also (64:07 - 64:12)
have you know at the end of the story (64:09 - 64:14)
they all come and help you out as well (64:12 - 64:16)
you know whereas I don't think they do (64:14 - 64:18)
anything like that in any other game (64:16 - 64:19)
nope (64:18 - 64:22)
uh Elite Four so they do the thing (64:19 - 64:23)
throughout the same thing (64:22 - 64:26)
that I do like uh which is sprinkle in (64:23 - 64:27)
the Elite Four (64:26 - 64:30)
and I want to say that like X and Y (64:27 - 64:32)
didn't do that at all (64:30 - 64:35)
um and I don't think black and white did (64:32 - 64:38)
either like you never see Marshall early (64:35 - 64:40)
you never see Grimsley early you never (64:38 - 64:41)
see (64:40 - 64:44)
Chantel early (64:41 - 64:45)
um (64:44 - 64:47)
to let's go Pikachu Let's uh to be fair (64:45 - 64:49)
you know in red and blue they didn't do (64:47 - 64:51)
that as well but in let's go Pikachu (64:49 - 64:54)
let's go Eevee they sprinkle Lorelei in (64:51 - 64:56)
that journey and I thought that was such (64:54 - 64:58)
a great (64:56 - 65:00)
upgrade to that story was to like (64:58 - 65:02)
sprinkler in (65:00 - 65:03)
um I wish they did with the other ones (65:02 - 65:06)
but they they do this with Rika and (65:03 - 65:08)
Poppy and (65:06 - 65:11)
um hassle you see hassle very early on (65:08 - 65:14)
at the school you see Rika I think two (65:11 - 65:16)
to three times and then you see Poppy (65:14 - 65:20)
one to two times I believe at least once (65:16 - 65:24)
poppy oh poppy yeah I don't know I don't (65:20 - 65:26)
know what that is (65:24 - 65:27)
um (65:26 - 65:31)
so the Elite Four has uh like a test to (65:27 - 65:32)
get into (65:31 - 65:35)
and this was so weird this was so crazy (65:32 - 65:40)
this is so weird I like the test except (65:35 - 65:42)
I felt like it was like okay so I've (65:40 - 65:44)
told the story a million times but do (65:42 - 65:45)
you guys remember playing gold and (65:44 - 65:48)
silver and like silver breaks in right (65:45 - 65:50)
and steals a Pokemon and when when you (65:48 - 65:52)
see it his name is question mark (65:50 - 65:53)
question mark question mark and then he (65:52 - 65:55)
runs away and then the police come and (65:53 - 65:57)
they're like did you catch his name and (65:55 - 65:58)
I was like yeah it was question mark (65:57 - 66:00)
question mark question mark like I (65:58 - 66:02)
caught it and I thought like (66:00 - 66:04)
I I thought I did like I thought I got (66:02 - 66:06)
it right right like you know I was I was (66:04 - 66:08)
11 years old gold and silver came out (66:06 - 66:11)
and so so when I played through gold and (66:08 - 66:13)
silver every time I encountered silver (66:11 - 66:14)
his name was question mark question mark (66:13 - 66:17)
question mark and I thought when I got (66:14 - 66:19)
to the Elite Four that they were going (66:17 - 66:21)
to actually reveal what his name was I (66:19 - 66:23)
was like this entire time I don't know (66:21 - 66:25)
what his name is and then the final (66:23 - 66:27)
battle right because there's no twist at (66:25 - 66:29)
the end right you already played red and (66:27 - 66:30)
blue you know the twist is like you're (66:29 - 66:32)
gonna battle your rival it's question (66:30 - 66:34)
mark question mark question mark So Okay (66:32 - 66:37)
okay so in this game at the beginning (66:34 - 66:40)
you're asked what you want to do this (66:37 - 66:41)
was one of the questions it'll say like (66:40 - 66:43)
why what do you want to do and one of (66:41 - 66:45)
the one of the questions one of the (66:43 - 66:47)
answers is like I want to complete my (66:45 - 66:49)
Pokedex and then the other answer is (66:47 - 66:51)
like I want to become Champion so I (66:49 - 66:54)
picked I wanted to complete my Pokedex I (66:51 - 66:55)
didn't care about being Champion I (66:54 - 66:57)
wanted to play my Pokedex so one of the (66:55 - 67:01)
questions Rika asks you is why are you (66:57 - 67:04)
here and it was to complete your Pokedex (67:01 - 67:07)
or to become Champion so I thought that (67:04 - 67:10)
she was asking based on what I would (67:07 - 67:12)
what was asked to me at the beginning of (67:10 - 67:14)
the game but if you pick that answer you (67:12 - 67:16)
automatically fail you have to say I'm (67:14 - 67:19)
here to be Champion which is like (67:16 - 67:21)
it gave me that gold and silver Vibes (67:19 - 67:25)
all over again like it's almost like you (67:21 - 67:26)
you're you're giving me a trick question (67:25 - 67:29)
of like what what did you say what did (67:26 - 67:32)
you say 70 hours ago can you remember (67:29 - 67:35)
what you used the goal you set yourself (67:32 - 67:38)
yeah I remember the goal (67:35 - 67:38)
[Laughter] (67:38 - 67:42)
the girl's funny but like I like the (67:43 - 67:46)
little like interview quiz she did it (67:45 - 67:49)
did have a good sense of like I don't (67:46 - 67:51)
know stress (67:49 - 67:53)
I just I find it weird because it was (67:51 - 67:55)
like well first of all if you get it (67:53 - 67:57)
wrong you have no idea what you've done (67:55 - 67:59)
wrong right you're like oh right just no (67:57 - 68:01)
sorry you failed you're like oh (67:59 - 68:04)
okay and you're like well okay well so I (68:01 - 68:06)
got it wrong the first time so I looked (68:04 - 68:07)
up the answers because I was like I'm (68:06 - 68:08)
not I'm not going through this right I'm (68:07 - 68:10)
not doing this this is not this is not (68:08 - 68:11)
fun (68:10 - 68:14)
experience right there yeah (68:11 - 68:16)
it was just like I can't even remember (68:14 - 68:19)
what the one that I got wrong was but it (68:16 - 68:21)
was oh I think it was the stuff around (68:19 - 68:23)
the gym so that was fair like I couldn't (68:21 - 68:25)
remember (68:23 - 68:25)
um (68:25 - 68:28)
the I I couldn't remember the gym (68:25 - 68:30)
leaders names so I completely failed on (68:28 - 68:32)
that one but yeah (68:30 - 68:34)
I was just like you know some of them (68:32 - 68:35)
have correct answers and some of them (68:34 - 68:38)
don't so it's like I don't understand (68:35 - 68:39)
what (68:38 - 68:41)
I don't understand what they're trying (68:39 - 68:43)
to do here I didn't find it fun I felt (68:41 - 68:45)
it was weird and cringy and I'm just (68:43 - 68:48)
like why do I have to do this when I've (68:45 - 68:50)
already got the badges right the point (68:48 - 68:52)
of the badges is to to be able to battle (68:50 - 68:53)
the Elite Four why have I now got some (68:52 - 68:56)
random other challenge could they just (68:53 - 68:57)
not be bothered having an actual Victory (68:56 - 68:59)
Road in this one like what's the point (68:57 - 69:01)
I'm I'm totally okay with no more (68:59 - 69:04)
Victory Road for the record I was very (69:01 - 69:05)
happy that Galler had no Victory (69:04 - 69:07)
Gallagher had like three trainers and (69:05 - 69:09)
like a stretch of straight away or (69:07 - 69:11)
whatever I think thematically they're (69:09 - 69:12)
going for like the school stuff right (69:11 - 69:14)
yeah (69:12 - 69:17)
um and like two videos you can take that (69:14 - 69:19)
quiz anytime like you can you can go (69:17 - 69:21)
there with no Badges and take that whole (69:19 - 69:22)
quiz and at the end even if you got (69:21 - 69:24)
everything right Rico will say like (69:22 - 69:26)
she'll be like oh you don't have the (69:24 - 69:27)
badges so (69:26 - 69:29)
like you Pat you you failed because (69:27 - 69:33)
you're missing that part of the exam (69:29 - 69:34)
I do like yeah I get it's the school (69:33 - 69:36)
thing but the elite Ford is not the (69:34 - 69:38)
school and I know they have connections (69:36 - 69:39)
with the school but it's not the same (69:38 - 69:42)
thing do you have to go to the school (69:39 - 69:45)
to to to defeat the Elite Four like it (69:42 - 69:48)
just feels like this is the one kind of (69:45 - 69:50)
thing that they decided to do in this (69:48 - 69:52)
game and they went all in on it (69:50 - 69:55)
all the school is all powerful you must (69:52 - 69:58)
go to the school great did you like the (69:55 - 70:00)
quiz or are you the same I was just like (69:58 - 70:02)
what why (70:00 - 70:06)
first of all why what I mean (70:02 - 70:08)
hey do you remember what we called your (70:06 - 70:11)
school I'm forced to wear your uniform (70:08 - 70:14)
yeah hey do you remember who your first (70:11 - 70:15)
starter was (70:14 - 70:17)
yeah (70:15 - 70:22)
I do why are you asking me it's like (70:17 - 70:24)
when a teacher is bored it's like we're (70:22 - 70:26)
having a pop quiz what did I eat for (70:24 - 70:30)
lunch I don't care you're just toning it (70:26 - 70:33)
in aren't you I think I think again this (70:30 - 70:36)
is the part of the game where they're (70:33 - 70:38)
asking you all these questions and we (70:36 - 70:39)
all know game freak is taking data right (70:38 - 70:41)
how many people said they wanted to (70:39 - 70:42)
complete their Pokedex versus how many (70:41 - 70:44)
people said they wanted a complete (70:42 - 70:45)
Champion we don't know those answers (70:44 - 70:47)
we'll never know those answers game (70:45 - 70:49)
freak does it might be like 60 of people (70:47 - 70:51)
want to complete their Pokedex forty (70:49 - 70:52)
percent of people want to be championed (70:51 - 70:56)
but it's but like there there was a (70:52 - 70:59)
there was somebody in my twitch chat and (70:56 - 71:01)
they were like I was so excited to watch (70:59 - 71:03)
you stream because (71:01 - 71:06)
I told Rika my hardest battle was Larry (71:03 - 71:09)
and then Larry came out of the door and (71:06 - 71:11)
I said my hardest battle was Yono and (71:09 - 71:15)
they expected iono to come out the door (71:11 - 71:17)
which actually would have been really (71:15 - 71:19)
good it would have made that part (71:17 - 71:21)
interesting so like they're asking you (71:19 - 71:23)
all these questions of like what is your (71:21 - 71:26)
school what is your starter like who (71:23 - 71:28)
gave you the most trouble who should we (71:26 - 71:30)
fire which I think is a question that I (71:28 - 71:32)
actually asked like later on (71:30 - 71:34)
but like none of them none of the (71:32 - 71:37)
questions matter nothing matters and (71:34 - 71:40)
it's like there it's like they built the (71:37 - 71:43)
framework for those questions to change (71:40 - 71:45)
the game but they just don't change the (71:43 - 71:48)
game yet like they're so close to like (71:45 - 71:51)
what Greg said at the beginning and I (71:48 - 71:53)
agree with although I again I'm very (71:51 - 71:54)
okay with the don't save the world very (71:53 - 71:57)
boring I'm very okay with boring what (71:54 - 71:59)
are you doing for Christmas that's what (71:57 - 72:00)
my hair stylist asked me I was like (71:59 - 72:02)
literally nothing and I'm excited to do (72:00 - 72:05)
nothing I'm very very into doing nothing (72:02 - 72:07)
um but like (72:05 - 72:09)
when somebody was like oh I expected (72:07 - 72:11)
Yono to walk out the door because you (72:09 - 72:13)
picked Diono and I picked Larry I was (72:11 - 72:14)
like wow that sounds way cooler than (72:13 - 72:16)
what just happened here although Larry (72:14 - 72:18)
walking out is very cool Larry is very (72:16 - 72:19)
cool (72:18 - 72:21)
um here's the other thing is like even (72:19 - 72:24)
from a data collection standpoint (72:21 - 72:27)
you don't know why people chose these (72:24 - 72:28)
answers some of them chose it because (72:27 - 72:30)
they were their honest answers some of (72:28 - 72:31)
them chose it because I wanted to see (72:30 - 72:33)
what happened like (72:31 - 72:37)
from a data collection standpoint you (72:33 - 72:40)
don't know the actual authentic (72:37 - 72:43)
authenticity behind the answers so it (72:40 - 72:45)
makes your data useless (72:43 - 72:48)
yeah I mean you you calculate like you (72:45 - 72:50)
know 10 of people aren't going to answer (72:48 - 72:52)
honestly or ten percent of people you're (72:50 - 72:53)
guessing (72:52 - 72:56)
how many people answer those like you're (72:53 - 72:58)
guessing that there aren't answers I (72:56 - 72:59)
think some of the questions like like (72:58 - 73:01)
the beginning question is probably as (72:59 - 73:03)
accurate as you can get right right what (73:01 - 73:04)
do you want to do do you want to (73:03 - 73:05)
complete your Pokedex you want to be a (73:04 - 73:07)
gym challenge but like when you when (73:05 - 73:11)
when you're getting quizzed by ryrica (73:07 - 73:14)
like you're like what Al said Al's (73:11 - 73:16)
trying to answer optimally just to get (73:14 - 73:17)
through the quiz right because we like (73:16 - 73:19)
we don't know what you actually want us (73:17 - 73:21)
to say right and so when you have a (73:19 - 73:23)
thing that has only right answers (73:21 - 73:26)
your data (73:23 - 73:29)
is it useful for data collection I I (73:26 - 73:30)
mean the other thing about this quiz is (73:29 - 73:32)
I don't understand why these questions (73:30 - 73:35)
have any relevance to me being a good (73:32 - 73:38)
Bachelor like why does it matter that I (73:35 - 73:41)
remember what type one of the random gym (73:38 - 73:43)
leaders that I chose has right like I (73:41 - 73:46)
don't that that shouldn't matter right (73:43 - 73:47)
like I shouldn't have to care about (73:46 - 73:49)
these people to come and defeat the rest (73:47 - 73:51)
of you I want just one to ground you all (73:49 - 73:54)
into dust because I don't care about you (73:51 - 73:58)
exactly like oh my words I don't want to (73:54 - 74:00)
have a conversation about Christmas I (73:58 - 74:03)
just want to battle okay exactly uh Rika (74:00 - 74:05)
is fantastic I think her character (74:03 - 74:08)
design is great I think her dialogue (74:05 - 74:10)
throughout the game is great (74:08 - 74:11)
um like (74:10 - 74:14)
just they if we're talking like I feel (74:11 - 74:16)
like Rika gets a little overshadowed by (74:14 - 74:18)
Larry throughout this game but it's (74:16 - 74:22)
Larry so if Larry didn't exist I don't (74:18 - 74:24)
know who would who again I don't think (74:22 - 74:25)
I've met a person who doesn't like Rika (74:24 - 74:29)
she is Rika is this attention Cynthia (74:25 - 74:31)
yeah except better than Cynthia in every (74:29 - 74:33)
way (74:31 - 74:33)
I mean does Cynthia use clothes hire I (74:34 - 74:39)
don't think so so uhurika uh Cynthia (74:36 - 74:41)
uses Rose raid so you can take that (74:39 - 74:43)
entire conversation and put it with your (74:41 - 74:46)
hairdresser uh that's true my my (74:43 - 74:47)
hairdresser doesn't know what Pokemon is (74:46 - 74:49)
uh so she she has a wish cache a camera (74:47 - 74:53)
up a dawn fan a Dugtrio and a cloud sire (74:49 - 74:55)
um the this this was a good (74:53 - 74:57)
terrestrializing this one because it (74:55 - 75:01)
removes obviously weakness to to ground (74:57 - 75:02)
um (75:01 - 75:04)
well the the ability no matter what (75:02 - 75:06)
can't get hit by water because it has (75:04 - 75:10)
water absorb yeah yeah no I mean because (75:06 - 75:12)
um the poison because Poison's weak to (75:10 - 75:14)
ground it mean it would mean that she's (75:12 - 75:15)
now (75:14 - 75:19)
resisting ground got it gotta got it um (75:15 - 75:20)
yeah maybe I'm the only person that (75:19 - 75:22)
actually tried to attack it with ground (75:20 - 75:26)
I don't know well I I had this this is (75:22 - 75:29)
I had mold breaker the entire time and (75:26 - 75:30)
haven't really had a chance to use it so (75:29 - 75:33)
in this situation I could break the mold (75:30 - 75:36)
and her water absorb didn't matter and I (75:33 - 75:38)
could hit it with a watertight move so (75:36 - 75:39)
it like (75:38 - 75:42)
I finally was it was 70 hours later I (75:39 - 75:44)
could break the mold (75:42 - 75:47)
um so the I think the most interesting (75:44 - 75:49)
thing about this entire Elite Four and (75:47 - 75:51)
you don't realize it until poppy comes (75:49 - 75:55)
out is you're not moving rooms like Rika (75:51 - 75:57)
moves over and stands there and watches (75:55 - 76:00)
you as poppy comes out (75:57 - 76:01)
otherwise they'd have to design another (76:00 - 76:04)
room in the hallway we know that they (76:01 - 76:05)
don't like designing rooms in this game (76:04 - 76:09)
well we went from we went from uh I (76:05 - 76:11)
believe it's black and white where you (76:09 - 76:13)
could choose the order of the gym (76:11 - 76:14)
leaders right was that black black or (76:13 - 76:15)
white or black or white I think black (76:14 - 76:17)
and white did it first and they made a (76:15 - 76:18)
big deal about that they were like you (76:17 - 76:20)
can choose the order (76:18 - 76:21)
um (76:20 - 76:23)
there's no right or wrong order right (76:21 - 76:28)
but like for me I would go clockwise (76:23 - 76:31)
who's following a circle now yeah I went (76:28 - 76:33)
left right as well uh and then in sudden (76:31 - 76:35)
Moon they did the same thing right and (76:33 - 76:37)
in X and Y they did the same thing and X (76:35 - 76:39)
and Y you walk into like that church or (76:37 - 76:40)
that Cathedral and they have the four (76:39 - 76:43)
rooms um I always do wither Shins (76:40 - 76:45)
what (76:43 - 76:48)
what is that uh and then (76:45 - 76:51)
in Galler they take that away (76:48 - 76:54)
because it's a tournament right makes (76:51 - 76:56)
sense (76:54 - 76:57)
um (76:56 - 76:59)
and then in this game they they I I (76:57 - 77:01)
think taking it away is fine I don't (76:59 - 77:06)
like I I I don't think the I've I again (77:01 - 77:08)
I I don't know how other people are (77:06 - 77:10)
playing 100 of the time but like (77:08 - 77:12)
even in Sun and Moon (77:10 - 77:15)
I think I I think I did like (77:12 - 77:17)
Olivia first because I was like oh (77:15 - 77:19)
Olivia's gonna be the easiest because I (77:17 - 77:21)
she is all rock and I had like two water (77:19 - 77:22)
when I played through Sunday moon but I (77:21 - 77:25)
I saved kahili for last because the and (77:22 - 77:26)
the reason I saved kahili for last (77:25 - 77:28)
wasn't because she was all the way on (77:26 - 77:30)
the right hand side it was because she (77:28 - 77:31)
was the only one up there I've never (77:30 - 77:35)
battled before so it was like exciting (77:31 - 77:38)
um yeah and in X and Y it's like well (77:35 - 77:39)
you can pick the order here are the (77:38 - 77:42)
types but like they never tell you the (77:39 - 77:43)
elite four members so you have no clue (77:42 - 77:47)
who you're really facing or looking at (77:43 - 77:49)
um so you're really you're only off like (77:47 - 77:51)
so yeah in that game it was like well I (77:49 - 77:53)
guess I'll just go left to right because (77:51 - 77:56)
I don't know who is who like I have to (77:53 - 77:58)
fight them eventually (77:56 - 77:59)
um (77:58 - 78:02)
I liked this thematically I guess you (77:59 - 78:04)
could easily say like oh there's only (78:02 - 78:05)
one room so they'd have to design more (78:04 - 78:07)
rooms but like (78:05 - 78:09)
there was something very cool about like (78:07 - 78:10)
battling and seeing Rika and seeing (78:09 - 78:12)
Poppy and seeing them like standing (78:10 - 78:14)
there watching you like it it did kind (78:12 - 78:17)
of (78:14 - 78:17)
feel to me like I'm not in this empty (78:17 - 78:22)
room battling this Elite Four member in (78:20 - 78:25)
front of nobody I gave me a small sense (78:22 - 78:28)
of Galler where like there's an audience (78:25 - 78:31)
yeah a little bit (78:28 - 78:31)
yeah I think yeah yeah I mean I was (78:32 - 78:36)
mostly joking about the rooms like we (78:34 - 78:38)
know I mean I've only just realized that (78:36 - 78:39)
none of the gym battles are actually (78:38 - 78:41)
inside they're all outside (78:39 - 78:45)
um which is quite funny yep um but I (78:41 - 78:48)
yeah I mean I personally it does feel a (78:45 - 78:51)
little bit weird that the the mo the (78:48 - 78:52)
game that gives you the most Choice (78:51 - 78:54)
gives you the least choice in the Elite (78:52 - 78:57)
Four I find it a little bit weird yeah I (78:54 - 78:59)
don't particularly care because (78:57 - 79:01)
you have to battle all four of them (78:59 - 79:04)
anyway before you finish and it's not (79:01 - 79:07)
like it's you know it's not sure you (79:04 - 79:08)
need to defeat all the eight gems before (79:07 - 79:10)
you get to it but you can do so many (79:08 - 79:12)
other things in between whereas here you (79:10 - 79:14)
have to defeat all four of them in one (79:12 - 79:16)
go and I don't really care about (79:14 - 79:17)
choosing the order but I can understand (79:16 - 79:19)
why people might be frustrated about (79:17 - 79:22)
that in the game with most choice (79:19 - 79:24)
yeah but like that's that's the point (79:22 - 79:27)
like you you don't get a break you have (79:24 - 79:29)
to do all four in a row (79:27 - 79:31)
um and they do give you time the other (79:29 - 79:33)
not weird like it's weird but it's like (79:31 - 79:35)
also not weird again it depends on what (79:33 - 79:37)
side of the fence (79:35 - 79:39)
um like (79:37 - 79:43)
you like every Elite Four (79:39 - 79:45)
and unless you're doing unless you're (79:43 - 79:47)
doing some self-imposed rules slash (79:45 - 79:49)
challenge mode I don't know who is going (79:47 - 79:51)
to into the Elite Four that isn't (79:49 - 79:56)
healing in between every battle like (79:51 - 79:59)
yeah um so well I wasn't the first time (79:56 - 80:01)
because I I didn't realize I was really (79:59 - 80:04)
low on revives (80:01 - 80:06)
like (80:04 - 80:06)
I will say that this is the first (80:07 - 80:10)
Pokemon game ever (80:08 - 80:14)
in 26 years that I have played that I (80:10 - 80:16)
have never purchased (80:14 - 80:20)
a potion a super potion a revive I I I I (80:16 - 80:23)
seriously in my 70 hours I didn't buy a (80:20 - 80:27)
single one of those items (80:23 - 80:29)
um and (80:27 - 80:31)
I used them that was the first time I (80:29 - 80:33)
used those items because after I (80:31 - 80:36)
defeated uh Rika I was like okay well (80:33 - 80:38)
these two people these two Pokemon need (80:36 - 80:40)
hyper potions this one needs a revive (80:38 - 80:42)
okay I'm ready for round two (80:40 - 80:44)
um and I know people were upset that (80:42 - 80:46)
like (80:44 - 80:49)
uh Galler they heal you in between they (80:46 - 80:51)
Auto heal you (80:49 - 80:52)
and I was like yeah I understand for (80:51 - 80:54)
like challenge mode like you know if (80:52 - 80:55)
you're doing a Nuzlocke and two Pokemon (80:54 - 80:56)
faint you know you're supposed to keep (80:55 - 80:58)
those fainted because you know you're (80:56 - 80:59)
doing your Nuzlocke very very (80:58 - 81:02)
understandable but at the same time like (80:59 - 81:04)
I would assume that most people are just (81:02 - 81:05)
healing in between doing the next one (81:04 - 81:07)
healing in between doing the next one (81:05 - 81:08)
because (81:07 - 81:10)
you know Pokemon isn't making these (81:08 - 81:11)
games (81:10 - 81:13)
in mind of like what about those (81:11 - 81:15)
nuzlockers like they're you know they're (81:13 - 81:16)
just trying to make the best game they (81:15 - 81:17)
can (81:16 - 81:18)
um (81:17 - 81:21)
when the other thing I wanted to just (81:18 - 81:22)
point out is that this is the first (81:21 - 81:24)
Pokemon game I think ever (81:22 - 81:26)
where the Elite Four and the gym leaders (81:24 - 81:29)
do not use potions themselves (81:26 - 81:33)
uh so Cynthia specifically uses three (81:29 - 81:35)
hyper potions and all the elite four (81:33 - 81:38)
members before her use two and in black (81:35 - 81:40)
and white I think Iris uses four Heights (81:38 - 81:42)
she can use up the four hyper potions (81:40 - 81:43)
and I think everyone before them you can (81:42 - 81:47)
use up to three uh there is a set Mount (81:43 - 81:49)
um and I think this is fine (81:47 - 81:53)
because like if I surf (81:49 - 81:55)
um (81:53 - 81:57)
Cynthia's Spirit tomb and I bring it (81:55 - 81:59)
down to red (81:57 - 82:02)
she's going to hyper potion because it's (81:59 - 82:03)
in red (82:02 - 82:07)
and I'm just going to hit surf again (82:03 - 82:09)
and if it goes back to Red she's just (82:07 - 82:11)
going to hyper potion and I'm just going (82:09 - 82:14)
to hit surf again why would I not hit (82:11 - 82:18)
surf again right and you can in those (82:14 - 82:21)
older games you can actually (82:18 - 82:23)
force them to use hyper potions early (82:21 - 82:27)
which act well I guess I guess now like (82:23 - 82:28)
I'm explaining it now I'm thinking of (82:27 - 82:29)
like how it can be harder for people (82:28 - 82:31)
because like I know when they're going (82:29 - 82:33)
to use the potion because I've played so (82:31 - 82:36)
many Pokemon games so like I know that (82:33 - 82:39)
they're going to use it here (82:36 - 82:41)
versus like maybe them using it as (82:39 - 82:44)
optimal but in these the point being is (82:41 - 82:45)
in these games none of the champion (82:44 - 82:48)
champion Gym Leaders Elite Four they (82:45 - 82:51)
don't use any potions or any items (82:48 - 82:54)
I I I agree with you I think it can it (82:51 - 82:56)
can definitely make it more difficult (82:54 - 82:58)
for some people if you're not like aware (82:56 - 82:59)
of these things and not sure of the best (82:58 - 83:04)
way to deal with it but uh I (82:59 - 83:07)
it's not fun difficult it's annoying (83:04 - 83:08)
difficult yes (83:07 - 83:10)
so it's like oh I've worked all this (83:08 - 83:12)
hard to get this Pokemon down really (83:10 - 83:14)
hard really low and then oh never have (83:12 - 83:17)
to just do all that again yeah like this (83:14 - 83:20)
or or like you say if you're if you're (83:17 - 83:22)
if you're nearly one-shotting it then (83:20 - 83:24)
it's like oh I just do it again it (83:22 - 83:26)
doesn't it doesn't add challenge in that (83:24 - 83:28)
circumstance it's just annoying so I'm (83:26 - 83:29)
totally fine with them not having that (83:28 - 83:32)
yeah I think I I when I was expecting (83:29 - 83:33)
that I was like I don't get how that (83:32 - 83:35)
makes it harder but I also think of like (83:33 - 83:37)
oh I want to I want to I want to get (83:35 - 83:40)
them to like I want to do 60 damage (83:37 - 83:42)
right and then I want to do another 60 (83:40 - 83:45)
because if I do 80 I know they're going (83:42 - 83:46)
to potion (83:45 - 83:48)
so but I now now that I say that out (83:46 - 83:50)
loud I'm thinking of like I can now see (83:48 - 83:53)
how why using like two potions for the (83:50 - 83:55)
Cynthia would be harder I get it now (83:53 - 83:57)
um I I guess I just don't think they'll (83:55 - 83:59)
I had to talk that out I had to talk (83:57 - 84:00)
that out yeah (83:59 - 84:03)
but yeah they no one's no one's using (84:00 - 84:05)
any potions in this which (84:03 - 84:08)
again I think is is probably fine (84:05 - 84:09)
um (84:08 - 84:13)
uh so poppy comes out I was convinced (84:09 - 84:15)
poppy was like (84:13 - 84:17)
dead and that she was gonna be like a (84:15 - 84:19)
ghost type person she gave me very big (84:17 - 84:21)
like Ace roll-up Vibes (84:19 - 84:25)
what poppy is a haunted doll yeah I (84:21 - 84:27)
thought she was like I thought there was (84:25 - 84:29)
like a like a spiritual twist here if (84:27 - 84:33)
poppy was a haunted doll I would be in (84:29 - 84:36)
the poppy as it stands be gone toddler (84:33 - 84:38)
you have no place here (84:36 - 84:43)
I one shot each of her Pokemon just to (84:38 - 84:45)
get out of there as fast as I could and (84:43 - 84:47)
never have to look at this person again (84:45 - 84:50)
get out I hate you you are awful (84:47 - 84:53)
you know the the most jarring thing (84:50 - 84:56)
about poppy is they make such a big deal (84:53 - 84:59)
in sword and shield that Alistar is like (84:56 - 85:01)
the youngest gym leader (84:59 - 85:03)
to be fair she's not a gym leader but (85:01 - 85:05)
they made such a big deal that his (85:03 - 85:07)
characteristic trait is like he's like (85:05 - 85:10)
this boy who is stronger than these (85:07 - 85:12)
adults and then they're like here's an (85:10 - 85:14)
actual toddler who's an elite four (85:12 - 85:16)
member like (85:14 - 85:18)
it's just it's fine like I don't think (85:16 - 85:21)
Poppy's a bad character it's very cute (85:18 - 85:23)
uh very surprising she was steel I think (85:21 - 85:25)
that was like a decent twist that like (85:23 - 85:27)
she wasn't like fairy or something (85:25 - 85:30)
should have been porcelain doll ghost (85:27 - 85:33)
make her interesting as it was be gone (85:30 - 85:37)
toddler you have no place here (85:33 - 85:40)
um and I do I it's I do find it fun that (85:37 - 85:43)
she has both tinkerton and Carbonite uh (85:40 - 85:46)
yes with their with their uh lore they (85:43 - 85:48)
should have a battle and there's those (85:46 - 85:50)
two fought each other I would have been (85:48 - 85:52)
into that she has the caparaja Magnuson (85:50 - 85:56)
Bronx on corbinite tinkerton uh I think (85:52 - 85:58)
I think her Pokemon matches the (85:56 - 85:59)
personality (85:58 - 86:03)
she has uh I think though that (85:59 - 86:06)
is significantly worse when you remove (86:03 - 86:08)
the fairy type from it and you just make (86:06 - 86:10)
it steal (86:08 - 86:11)
yeah yeah because there was weak (86:10 - 86:13)
defeating as well which is probably what (86:11 - 86:14)
you've been using for most of it except (86:13 - 86:17)
Carver night I guess right but uh and (86:14 - 86:20)
then Larry comes out number three on (86:17 - 86:24)
Brunswick uh and my entire time I am I'm (86:20 - 86:26)
sweating because I'm like if there's an (86:24 - 86:28)
elite four member that has a uh that has (86:26 - 86:30)
electric I'm done for if there's an (86:28 - 86:32)
elite four member that's grass I'm (86:30 - 86:34)
probably done for here so Larry comes (86:32 - 86:36)
out and I'm like he's gonna please Larry (86:34 - 86:39)
I I first off I'm excited Larry's here (86:36 - 86:42)
Larry's here Larry also is proving that (86:39 - 86:44)
they can't even people don't even want (86:42 - 86:46)
to join the League before it pays so bad (86:44 - 86:49)
they're making this poor guy do overtime (86:46 - 86:52)
after his office job to come into the (86:49 - 86:53)
Elite Four and they won't even let him (86:52 - 86:56)
use his real friends (86:53 - 86:59)
Larry is a yes man he's gonna get the (86:56 - 87:00)
job done I mean they should get the job (86:59 - 87:03)
done for sure so (87:00 - 87:06)
and so I'm like I'm like okay there's no (87:03 - 87:08)
way they're gonna make you do your same (87:06 - 87:09)
team right and he says that he's like my (87:08 - 87:11)
boss made me change types and I'm like (87:09 - 87:13)
okay cool please don't be electric (87:11 - 87:15)
please don't be the grass and then I (87:13 - 87:17)
think he says he's going to use flying I (87:15 - 87:19)
think he says like yeah which is like (87:17 - 87:21)
really funny how like my first thought (87:19 - 87:23)
is like holy cow are you gonna use (87:21 - 87:26)
mostly the same team because there are (87:23 - 87:29)
so many normal flying Pokemon and you're (87:26 - 87:31)
that's your loophole to get around this (87:29 - 87:32)
now he does have a Pokemon that's (87:31 - 87:34)
exactly the same he brings star Raptor (87:32 - 87:36)
so star Raptors both on his (87:34 - 87:42)
um uh gym team and his his uh Elite Four (87:36 - 87:43)
team (87:42 - 87:45)
thinking back I do think it would be (87:43 - 87:48)
really funny if his three Pokemon in his (87:45 - 87:50)
gym challenge were normal flying Pokemon (87:48 - 87:52)
and then he extended it here I think (87:50 - 87:55)
that would be like a better long con (87:52 - 87:58)
joke although it would it would would (87:55 - 88:01)
add less variety I suppose but (87:58 - 88:04)
uh he has a Tropius an oracorea which (88:01 - 88:06)
electric and grass starting off so this (88:04 - 88:08)
is not great for me (88:06 - 88:11)
and then Altaria his staraptor and then (88:08 - 88:13)
flamigo (88:11 - 88:16)
um was here or cardio electric yeah it's (88:13 - 88:19)
electric for everyone (88:16 - 88:19)
he only gets electric I think I thought (88:19 - 88:24)
mine was fire (88:22 - 88:26)
there's another person that has fire (88:24 - 88:29)
somewhere I think the person right (88:26 - 88:31)
before the Elite Four on that route the (88:29 - 88:33)
two people on that route I think they (88:31 - 88:35)
have a fire one (88:33 - 88:37)
huh (88:35 - 88:39)
but yeah there are there is a person out (88:37 - 88:40)
there you fight with fire not like a gym (88:39 - 88:43)
leader (88:40 - 88:43)
um (88:43 - 88:45)
yeah I don't did was it electric for you (88:46 - 88:49)
Al (88:48 - 88:52)
yeah what was your starter no it's (88:49 - 88:54)
electric for everyone he has he has no (88:52 - 88:56)
he there's no variety here in the Elite (88:54 - 88:57)
Four (88:56 - 88:59)
they gave you a variety up to this point (88:57 - 89:00)
Greg you get no variety when you get the (88:59 - 89:02)
lead for your choices are done they're (89:00 - 89:05)
static now (89:02 - 89:05)
although him having oricorius based on (89:06 - 89:10)
your starter would be an interesting (89:08 - 89:15)
choice yeah they don't do that ah (89:10 - 89:15)
um and then there's much more to say (89:20 - 89:23)
about Larry Ray but he's no I do like (89:21 - 89:24)
heavy he literally complains about it (89:23 - 89:27)
though here's a cute little Easter egg (89:24 - 89:30)
uh when you battle Larry in the um when (89:27 - 89:32)
you battle Larry anytime his his tie (89:30 - 89:34)
have little clouds on it so they kind of (89:32 - 89:36)
foreshadows that he'll have flying (89:34 - 89:38)
Pokemon when you battle him the first (89:36 - 89:39)
time (89:38 - 89:41)
um no Larry's great I don't know if (89:39 - 89:42)
there's anything else to say well we (89:41 - 89:44)
finally get hassle here (89:42 - 89:46)
um (89:44 - 89:48)
uh which is Dragon finally what we've (89:46 - 89:52)
all been waiting for so excited yeah I'm (89:48 - 89:57)
not like what is uh hassle is (89:52 - 89:57)
not interesting to me in a lot of ways (89:57 - 90:03)
and I don't know what they were trying (90:00 - 90:05)
to do with the again very I'm a huge fan (90:03 - 90:07)
of them all standing there in the Elite (90:05 - 90:09)
Four right like I like that they're all (90:07 - 90:12)
standing there together but like the (90:09 - 90:15)
shouting that like hassles like a deaf (90:12 - 90:19)
old man who can't he like what what like (90:15 - 90:22)
because you you get none of that and (90:19 - 90:24)
you're talking to him originally I (90:22 - 90:27)
didn't think that Hassell couldn't hear (90:24 - 90:27)
him (90:27 - 90:30)
my understanding was that Larry talks in (90:27 - 90:32)
such a quiet monotone (90:30 - 90:34)
all the time (90:32 - 90:36)
that when he was saying yes it's your (90:34 - 90:37)
time (90:36 - 90:39)
again voice acting would have helped (90:37 - 90:41)
with this joke a lot I understood it as (90:39 - 90:44)
Larry just never speaks up (90:41 - 90:48)
Larry never is above a a small mutter (90:44 - 90:50)
and they're like no you have to call (90:48 - 90:52)
he's like all right hassle it's your (90:50 - 90:54)
turn and like you're never raising it (90:52 - 90:56)
until they finally convince them like no (90:54 - 90:58)
you have to scream and then he does it (90:56 - 90:59)
has nothing to do with hassle it's about (90:58 - 91:02)
how lackluster and beaten down Larry is (90:59 - 91:04)
again voice acting would have helped (91:02 - 91:07)
that a lot (91:04 - 91:07)
yeah I I think hassle is a great Dragon (91:07 - 91:14)
team for the record I think you know (91:10 - 91:16)
um there have been other Dragon elite (91:14 - 91:18)
four members in the past uh I think I (91:16 - 91:20)
think Castle has a really good variety (91:18 - 91:23)
here we have a neuburn a Haxorus uh (91:20 - 91:27)
dragon a flappel and a back Excalibur (91:23 - 91:30)
um max caliber is like one of those (91:27 - 91:31)
Pokemon (91:30 - 91:33)
where (91:31 - 91:35)
well in my case I had all water Pokemon (91:33 - 91:38)
but if you don't know what it does and (91:35 - 91:40)
you don't know what Glade Rush does it (91:38 - 91:42)
can really mess you up (91:40 - 91:44)
um because I had no when it used Glade (91:42 - 91:46)
rush I was like okay is this like Hyper (91:44 - 91:48)
Beam do I like do I get a turn where he (91:46 - 91:51)
can't do anything now or (91:48 - 91:54)
um like it does a lot of damage really (91:51 - 91:57)
quickly and it hits very hard so for (91:54 - 91:59)
those that don't know what glaive (91:57 - 92:01)
Rush does (91:59 - 92:04)
um it's 100 accurate it does 120 power (92:01 - 92:07)
uh the user throws its entire body into (92:04 - 92:10)
a reckless charge attacks from opposing (92:07 - 92:13)
Pokemon during the next turn cannot miss (92:10 - 92:18)
and will inflict double damage (92:13 - 92:23)
um which is if you survive yeah you (92:18 - 92:26)
survive it's really good for you to use (92:23 - 92:29)
like a 80 accurate move because you're (92:26 - 92:31)
gonna do so much damage yourself and (92:29 - 92:33)
you're not going to miss (92:31 - 92:35)
um so literally the only reason I ended (92:33 - 92:38)
up winning is because he knocked out my (92:35 - 92:40)
Pokemon with Glade rush and my next (92:38 - 92:45)
Pokemon if my damage wasn't doubled it (92:40 - 92:47)
wouldn't have knocked him out and I (92:45 - 92:50)
needed that little bit of extra damage (92:47 - 92:53)
because he was close to dying I think it (92:50 - 92:54)
was jet punch because I was like oh I (92:53 - 92:56)
don't outspeed you and I was like I (92:54 - 92:57)
don't think jet punch knocks out but (92:56 - 92:59)
because he just Glade rushed my jet (92:57 - 93:00)
punch did a little more damage and I was (92:59 - 93:02)
able to win the the question I have (93:00 - 93:04)
about that move is if you glaive rush (93:02 - 93:07)
and then protect the next turn (93:04 - 93:09)
does your move not (93:07 - 93:10)
is your move not affected by the person (93:09 - 93:12)
I think I think that is the strategy I (93:10 - 93:14)
think that is what you're supposed to do (93:12 - 93:15)
with Clay okay yeah that's what I (93:14 - 93:18)
thought I'm like yeah I I haven't I (93:15 - 93:20)
haven't tried it so I was like I don't (93:18 - 93:21)
know I mean there is I guess there's the (93:20 - 93:24)
chance where like (93:21 - 93:26)
you Glade rush because you're faster and (93:24 - 93:29)
then they go next but if they go (93:26 - 93:31)
and then you Glade rush and then you (93:29 - 93:32)
protect you're in a pretty good spot (93:31 - 93:35)
yeah (93:32 - 93:36)
um (93:35 - 93:39)
or in the case where yeah like he knocks (93:36 - 93:40)
you out (93:39 - 93:42)
and then use you use that term to switch (93:40 - 93:45)
and then he just protects (93:42 - 93:47)
um (93:45 - 93:50)
and then finally we have Gita (93:47 - 93:50)
who (93:50 - 93:55)
uh has espartha (93:52 - 93:59)
Go goat espathra sorry aspathra go go uh (93:55 - 94:05)
Volusia avalug King Gambit and glamora (93:59 - 94:08)
um I will say like I think her team is (94:05 - 94:10)
like really good like there's a good (94:08 - 94:12)
variety here yeah (94:10 - 94:13)
um I I don't think I don't think the (94:12 - 94:16)
only thing that like I guess annoys me (94:13 - 94:17)
is like (94:16 - 94:20)
the glamora yeah you're you're using (94:17 - 94:22)
you're well that annoys me too but (94:20 - 94:23)
you're using Pokemon that your gym (94:22 - 94:24)
leaders have used and there's so many (94:23 - 94:27)
new Pokemon in here it's like a little (94:24 - 94:30)
a little like uh where's the variety I (94:27 - 94:32)
guess (94:30 - 94:36)
like uh tulip uses espathra and then um (94:32 - 94:39)
kobu uses Volusia (94:36 - 94:41)
so it's like ah it'd be nice if those (94:39 - 94:44)
were maybe like different oh I see what (94:41 - 94:46)
you're saying (94:44 - 94:48)
but new Pokemon that hadn't been used (94:46 - 94:50)
but right right right right right I got (94:48 - 94:52)
it I'm like no those are all the one (94:50 - 94:54)
that's not new is off a look no go go oh (94:52 - 94:57)
well go go well go go it's everywhere (94:54 - 94:57)
um (94:57 - 94:59)
yeah I mean like not the end of the (94:57 - 95:01)
world because I think I think her team (94:59 - 95:03)
really works here okay so the the (95:01 - 95:07)
complaint is that her Ace which is (95:03 - 95:10)
glamora should have been it's a setup (95:07 - 95:13)
Pokemon it's its ability is if you hit (95:10 - 95:15)
it it sets up toxic and if you hit it (95:13 - 95:17)
twice it sets up well it sets a poison (95:15 - 95:20)
and then if you hit it twice it sets up (95:17 - 95:21)
toxic (95:20 - 95:25)
so even if you one shot it you're still (95:21 - 95:27)
setting up spikes for the remaining of (95:25 - 95:30)
the fight yeah (95:27 - 95:30)
um I get that it's our Ace and some (95:31 - 95:34)
people argue that King Gambit should be (95:32 - 95:37)
a race I I also agree like both of those (95:34 - 95:41)
Pokemon are reflective of her hair (95:37 - 95:43)
um King Gambit has really long hair and (95:41 - 95:45)
glamora kinda looks like her hair so (95:43 - 95:47)
they they fit there thematically at the (95:45 - 95:51)
end uh I I I'm not that's it not that (95:47 - 95:52)
her whole team is based off her hair but (95:51 - 95:54)
you know (95:52 - 95:57)
that's that is a that is a theme stretch (95:54 - 95:59)
you don't think that glamora (95:57 - 96:02)
is her Ace because of her hair like I (95:59 - 96:06)
think the two are kind of (96:02 - 96:09)
what (96:06 - 96:09)
why did why else do you think Jesus in (96:09 - 96:14)
glamora it's a flower it's also it's (96:11 - 96:17)
also part of the underground like yeah (96:14 - 96:20)
part of the whole history tied into the (96:17 - 96:23)
into the what happened at (96:20 - 96:25)
the town the whole thing and the cavern (96:23 - 96:27)
that happens in area zero like well even (96:25 - 96:30)
even if you look at Diantha like it's (96:27 - 96:32)
obvious that Mega gardevoirs are Ace (96:30 - 96:36)
because of how Diantha looks like they (96:32 - 96:39)
base Pokemon off people's appearance all (96:36 - 96:40)
the time (96:39 - 96:42)
I mean I can think of our kind of a king (96:40 - 96:44)
Gambit (96:42 - 96:46)
King Emmett's sitting on his long hair (96:44 - 96:47)
that's the cool part about King Gambit (96:46 - 96:49)
are you sitting on a rock no he's (96:47 - 96:51)
sitting on his hair (96:49 - 96:53)
his hair comes down and he's sitting on (96:51 - 96:54)
it that's what made that I thought it (96:53 - 96:56)
was a rock too but no he's legit sitting (96:54 - 96:59)
on his hair (96:56 - 96:59)
his hair is like so hard to steal that (97:01 - 97:06)
it comes around it comes down so when (97:04 - 97:10)
when he dies you'll see it unfold (97:06 - 97:11)
um (97:10 - 97:16)
and uh but but anyways I think her team (97:11 - 97:18)
is great (97:16 - 97:20)
structurally wise again somebody might (97:18 - 97:22)
be listening to have been like oh I one (97:20 - 97:23)
shot all our Pokemon yeah I'm sure you (97:22 - 97:26)
did I I applaud you I'm not being (97:23 - 97:29)
sarcastic there are plenty of people (97:26 - 97:30)
that have no problem with any Champions (97:29 - 97:32)
any four members any Gym Leaders you're (97:30 - 97:33)
good at Pokemon you're listening to a (97:32 - 97:36)
Pokemon podcast (97:33 - 97:36)
um (97:37 - 97:41)
if they literally move glamora to the (97:38 - 97:43)
front I think this battle becomes so (97:41 - 97:46)
hard for a casual player again not (97:43 - 97:48)
somebody who has played every single (97:46 - 97:50)
Pokemon game I think for a casual player (97:48 - 97:52)
if you're switching in Pokemon (97:50 - 97:55)
constantly and they're getting toxic not (97:52 - 97:57)
poisoned but toxic (97:55 - 97:59)
I bet you struggle with this super hard (97:57 - 98:02)
yeah and I think I wonder if they tried (97:59 - 98:05)
that and they realized it was too hard (98:02 - 98:06)
for people and they put it in the back (98:05 - 98:08)
instead (98:06 - 98:10)
because it really doesn't make sense (98:08 - 98:12)
it's in the back (98:10 - 98:14)
at all (98:12 - 98:17)
like again King Gambit could have easily (98:14 - 98:19)
been her Ace (98:17 - 98:21)
they made the game they made the (98:19 - 98:23)
character they can justify it yeah but (98:21 - 98:26)
the fact that glamora is in the back as (98:23 - 98:28)
a setup Pokemon I feel like tells me (98:26 - 98:29)
that they tried to put in the front and (98:28 - 98:31)
it made the battle too hard for people (98:29 - 98:33)
now this is the point of the game where (98:31 - 98:35)
if they were using the choices you made (98:33 - 98:38)
and the decisions you made it would it (98:35 - 98:39)
would have been interesting to be like (98:38 - 98:41)
this player hasn't lost any battles (98:39 - 98:43)
they've gone through the test really (98:41 - 98:45)
easy for your playthrough we're putting (98:43 - 98:47)
glamora in the front this person has (98:45 - 98:50)
struggled maybe not I don't know it (98:47 - 98:51)
would be interesting I don't know if it (98:50 - 98:53)
makes the game significantly better but (98:51 - 98:54)
like (98:53 - 98:56)
I mean can I mean to back up your point (98:54 - 98:59)
in King Gambit's um ability makes more (98:56 - 99:01)
sense if it's the last one as well (98:59 - 99:03)
um because it's it's a attack and (99:01 - 99:05)
special attack increase (99:03 - 99:08)
for each of its allies that have already (99:05 - 99:10)
been defeated so if you put it in that (99:08 - 99:12)
one slot here earlier it's it's less (99:10 - 99:15)
that it's increasing mm-hmm (99:12 - 99:16)
I think they changed her team last (99:15 - 99:18)
minute because they realized it was too (99:16 - 99:18)
hard (99:18 - 99:21)
I could buy that probably yeah (99:18 - 99:24)
um now I did see I I did see a tick tock (99:21 - 99:27)
saying that Gita was the worst Champion (99:24 - 99:28)
ever (99:27 - 99:29)
I am not going to sit here and defend (99:28 - 99:32)
that she's the best Champion but let let (99:29 - 99:34)
us not forget that Lance was Champion (99:32 - 99:37)
with three dragon knight (99:34 - 99:41)
Charizard and like a Gyarados she is by (99:37 - 99:44)
far not the worst Champion like I I (99:41 - 99:48)
think I think I think her fight is fun (99:44 - 99:50)
um I think her Pokemon choice is great I (99:48 - 99:52)
don't think she's terribly difficult but (99:50 - 99:53)
like (99:52 - 99:56)
I it was a fun fight and if their goal (99:53 - 99:58)
was you know to play a video game to (99:56 - 100:00)
have fun I think I think it was very fun (99:58 - 100:03)
to like fight her (100:00 - 100:05)
um and her little dialogue clips and (100:03 - 100:06)
everything (100:05 - 100:09)
um I think the Elite Four uh as a whole (100:06 - 100:12)
not the best elite four but by far not (100:09 - 100:15)
the worst to lead for oh they're not the (100:12 - 100:16)
worst yeah and there's only three of (100:15 - 100:18)
them so (100:16 - 100:21)
yeah budget cuts budget cuts (100:18 - 100:23)
they just can't pay people in paldea (100:21 - 100:26)
it's the true lesson (100:23 - 100:27)
uh okay (100:26 - 100:31)
and then finally we have the battle with (100:27 - 100:35)
nimona nimona (100:31 - 100:35)
uh which is like so during your battle (100:35 - 100:41)
with Gita she says like oh like nimona (100:38 - 100:44)
had to hold back like uh like I gave her (100:41 - 100:47)
my full power and uh you know didn't (100:44 - 100:48)
didn't work (100:47 - 100:52)
yeah so (100:48 - 100:52)
how did we feel about this fight (100:54 - 100:59)
I had beaten her every time and that was (100:57 - 101:02)
a repeat of the same (100:59 - 101:06)
okay but but like (101:02 - 101:06)
sure (101:06 - 101:08)
I mean I I had to I had to rematch her (101:11 - 101:17)
once um I wasn't particularly difficult (101:14 - 101:21)
it was just uh I had just just not as (101:17 - 101:23)
good coverage as I'd wanted to and I was (101:21 - 101:26)
not leveled up as much but that was my (101:23 - 101:28)
problem with many things right like it's (101:26 - 101:32)
not a huge jump from Gita to nimona but (101:28 - 101:35)
five levels can be you know can be a (101:32 - 101:38)
significant difference especially if you (101:35 - 101:39)
weren't over leveled because I wasn't (101:38 - 101:41)
over levered for Gita right I was at (101:39 - 101:43)
slightly under level for guitar and so (101:41 - 101:45)
then for the the five level jump I had (101:43 - 101:47)
to go and and do a little bit of (101:45 - 101:49)
training for that but yeah I mean once (101:47 - 101:50)
you get up to similar levels it wasn't (101:49 - 101:52)
particularly difficult (101:50 - 101:54)
yeah I think that's like the maybe the (101:52 - 101:56)
most interesting part is this Elite so I (101:54 - 101:59)
think um I think Cynthia is the highest (101:56 - 102:01)
level Elite Four member (101:59 - 102:04)
uh I think she's (102:01 - 102:06)
65 although like I'm trying to remember (102:04 - 102:08)
Leon's Charizard as Leon's Charizard (102:06 - 102:11)
also 65. (102:08 - 102:12)
um (102:11 - 102:14)
but when you get to Gita her levels are (102:12 - 102:19)
61 61 61 61 61 62 and then what Al said (102:14 - 102:23)
is when you get to nimona she's 65 65 65 (102:19 - 102:27)
65 65 66. so there's a jump like if you (102:23 - 102:29)
are if you are if you are pushing 60s at (102:27 - 102:31)
the Elite Four which I was I think I (102:29 - 102:34)
think my highest was 60 and then the (102:31 - 102:36)
rest of my Pokemon were 58 (102:34 - 102:37)
and I came out of the Elite Four like (102:36 - 102:42)
you know 60 to 61. (102:37 - 102:44)
I could see why pneumonia like and you (102:42 - 102:46)
can challenge nimona right away like (102:44 - 102:48)
right as soon as you get out and you get (102:46 - 102:50)
like the you know the dialogue and the (102:48 - 102:52)
like we're all happy congrats on being (102:50 - 102:54)
Champion you can go to her right away it (102:52 - 102:57)
is possible that like she literally just (102:54 - 102:59)
overpowers you like four levels can be a (102:57 - 103:01)
lot uh especially for all of your (102:59 - 103:02)
Pokemon (103:01 - 103:06)
um she has lycanroc gudra de Dunsparce (103:02 - 103:08)
oathworm which I think is like the (103:06 - 103:10)
newest member of her team there at that (103:08 - 103:11)
point (103:10 - 103:14)
um Paul Mott and then either miascarata (103:11 - 103:19)
uh quakavel or uh Skelly dirge (103:14 - 103:19)
um (103:19 - 103:22)
so yeah I guess I don't know what the (103:20 - 103:24)
game wants I'm trying to think of (103:22 - 103:25)
somebody who was like under level of (103:24 - 103:26)
like where does what does the game want (103:25 - 103:28)
you to do at that point I mean just do a (103:26 - 103:29)
couple raids I guess and and catch some (103:28 - 103:31)
Pokemon (103:29 - 103:33)
I mean yeah well I don't think it's I (103:31 - 103:34)
don't think it's coincidence that all (103:33 - 103:37)
three of the like final battles are the (103:34 - 103:39)
I think the same levels or their same (103:37 - 103:41)
difficulty no matter what the rest of (103:39 - 103:43)
the (103:41 - 103:44)
um (103:43 - 103:45)
what's the word I'm looking for the the (103:44 - 103:49)
rest of those lines where well I don't (103:45 - 103:52)
mean penny a penny wasn't but the clavel (103:49 - 103:54)
was (103:52 - 103:57)
um I think cliffel was double check (103:54 - 104:00)
55. was he that low (103:57 - 104:03)
yeah so I think Arvin is at the same (104:00 - 104:07)
level that Gita is Arvin is pushing 60 I (104:03 - 104:09)
believe yeah (104:07 - 104:11)
so what I had done is I had gotten (104:09 - 104:15)
everybody up to the final (104:11 - 104:17)
I I know that this like I have to battle (104:15 - 104:20)
Arvin I have to battle (104:17 - 104:23)
nimona and I have to battle (104:20 - 104:23)
um (104:24 - 104:27)
Penny Cassiopeia penny (104:25 - 104:30)
and so after I completed the Elite Four (104:27 - 104:33)
I went in the order of the storyline (104:30 - 104:36)
that I had done so I did Arvin I did (104:33 - 104:40)
yeah a Cavill and Penny and then I did (104:36 - 104:42)
nimona and that progression (104:40 - 104:44)
was like okay I'm at the right level and (104:42 - 104:46)
then as I'm getting experience I'm at (104:44 - 104:48)
the right level for her too (104:46 - 104:52)
right like I didn't com I had held them (104:48 - 104:54)
off so when I did them they were they (104:52 - 104:56)
were Stepping Stones up and she was oh I (104:54 - 104:58)
see what you're saying already at her (104:56 - 104:59)
level (104:58 - 105:01)
even though I wasn't when I took on Gita (104:59 - 105:03)
when I did the other ones I stepped up (105:01 - 105:05)
to that and then that was the end it did (105:03 - 105:08)
seem like they wanted you to do like (105:05 - 105:10)
wanted you to do like if if the game (105:08 - 105:13)
gave you an order I think they would (105:10 - 105:15)
have said do Gita first (105:13 - 105:19)
then do team star (105:15 - 105:22)
then go back and do nimona (105:19 - 105:26)
nimona yeah I I guess so I feel like my (105:22 - 105:27)
point has got a bit muddled like they're (105:26 - 105:29)
not exactly the same but I just I double (105:27 - 105:32)
checked so Arvin is is highest is 63 (105:29 - 105:35)
pennies yeah 63 and (105:32 - 105:40)
um nimonas is 66. so no 63 oh her final (105:35 - 105:44)
one is 63. yeah oh yeah yeah yeah so (105:40 - 105:45)
there's there's a three level difference (105:44 - 105:47)
but that's not a humongous amount my (105:45 - 105:50)
point was just like so the the like (105:47 - 105:52)
final Titan battle is like 50 or (105:50 - 105:54)
something like that right whereas Arvin (105:52 - 105:57)
is like a big jump yeah whereas Arvin is (105:54 - 106:01)
almost the same as nimona and Penny and (105:57 - 106:04)
um you know the none of the the team (106:01 - 106:06)
star anywhere near that level but then (106:04 - 106:10)
clavel is 61 and Penny 63. like my point (106:06 - 106:12)
is just like I don't think it's (106:10 - 106:14)
coincidence that (106:12 - 106:16)
you can do these in any sort of order (106:14 - 106:18)
but there can it it feels like they want (106:16 - 106:20)
you to do the final battles for each of (106:18 - 106:23)
them roughly the same time yeah and and (106:20 - 106:25)
that's what I did and that's why they (106:23 - 106:27)
feel this similar difficulty it's almost (106:25 - 106:29)
like I know they gave you the the choice (106:27 - 106:31)
but like (106:29 - 106:34)
as as somebody who did the Titan thing (106:31 - 106:36)
first like like I said I was like oh I'm (106:34 - 106:38)
just gonna I'm just gonna skip (106:36 - 106:40)
everything and I'm just gonna knock out (106:38 - 106:42)
these last two Titans even though I'm 20 (106:40 - 106:43)
levels under because I I know I can do (106:42 - 106:45)
it (106:43 - 106:48)
um there just felt like when Arvin was (106:45 - 106:50)
like okay let's go meet my dad (106:48 - 106:53)
it felt like oh this is I like this does (106:50 - 106:57)
not feel right to do right now and if I (106:53 - 107:00)
would have went there because I beat (106:57 - 107:04)
the final Titan I was level 34. (107:00 - 107:06)
like (107:04 - 107:09)
Arvin would have smoked to me right like (107:06 - 107:12)
yeah that's because that's what I did as (107:09 - 107:14)
well because I I was similar with with (107:12 - 107:17)
the Titans and yeah he he is very (107:14 - 107:18)
difficult to be on that little level (107:17 - 107:21)
right right I mean like (107:18 - 107:25)
you I I wonder who I wonder if there was (107:21 - 107:26)
a person that did that I'm sure there (107:25 - 107:27)
was right like there was a person that (107:26 - 107:29)
just I'm gonna do all the Titans first (107:27 - 107:30)
and then they did all the Titans and (107:29 - 107:32)
then Arvin was like okay come to this (107:30 - 107:33)
Lighthouse and they go to the lighthouse (107:32 - 107:35)
and they get absolutely destroyed like (107:33 - 107:37)
at that point you know you know that (107:35 - 107:40)
Arvin is 62 63 or whatever he is and you (107:37 - 107:42)
can come back later right like this is (107:40 - 107:43)
what I mean what I said a couple (107:42 - 107:45)
episodes ago there's like the you lose (107:43 - 107:46)
money not that big of a deal it's so (107:45 - 107:48)
easy to get money in the game but like (107:46 - 107:50)
you don't yeah I mean you maybe gained (107:48 - 107:51)
one or two levels for knocking out one (107:50 - 107:52)
or two Pokemon but like again not the (107:51 - 107:54)
end of the world you just come back (107:52 - 107:55)
um (107:54 - 107:58)
but it like (107:55 - 107:58)
if you did (107:59 - 108:04)
it just seems like so much to do at the (108:01 - 108:07)
same time like (108:04 - 108:10)
like battle Arvin battle penny Battle of (108:07 - 108:11)
the Elite Four now do this other battle (108:10 - 108:13)
with nimona it's all it's all like there (108:11 - 108:15)
at the end which is like is that the (108:13 - 108:17)
whatever it's like not the worst thing (108:15 - 108:19)
but it's like (108:17 - 108:20)
it's a lot to do but that feels that (108:19 - 108:22)
feels right for the for coming to the (108:20 - 108:24)
climax of yeah a Pokemon story right (108:22 - 108:26)
like (108:24 - 108:28)
especially when all of those three (108:26 - 108:31)
stories have all been about battling (108:28 - 108:32)
um they're all climaxing at the same (108:31 - 108:35)
time or the end of them roughly the same (108:32 - 108:38)
time leading into the the final bit (108:35 - 108:41)
yeah I I don't know if I felt like (108:38 - 108:44)
nimona was harder than Gita like (108:41 - 108:45)
obviously you could blow through both (108:44 - 108:47)
but like when I try to like separate (108:45 - 108:49)
like blowing through both of them or (108:47 - 108:50)
like you know Gita didn't really give me (108:49 - 108:52)
a challenge but like I was like did did (108:50 - 108:55)
neoma feet like it's it's not (108:52 - 108:56)
necessarily like (108:55 - 108:58)
like Greg said like oh I blew through (108:56 - 109:00)
her like yeah I get it like Greg knows (108:58 - 109:02)
how to battle but like I think the point (109:00 - 109:04)
is like they they gave you that image (109:02 - 109:08)
that she beat Gita so easily like even (109:04 - 109:09)
though it's like oh yeah I beat her and (109:08 - 109:11)
I had like three Pokemon left over did I (109:09 - 109:14)
feel that she was harder than Gita I (109:11 - 109:17)
don't I think so like I don't feel like (109:14 - 109:19)
she was easier but like I didn't feel (109:17 - 109:21)
like she like when Gita was like oh yeah (109:19 - 109:24)
she was holding back and she crushed me (109:21 - 109:27)
and I was like I I kind of wish I got (109:24 - 109:28)
that because that's what they were (109:27 - 109:31)
hyping up like it was a fine battle I (109:28 - 109:33)
like she sets up Stealth Rock right away (109:31 - 109:36)
for everyone like I don't (109:33 - 109:38)
I see what you're saying but also like (109:36 - 109:41)
just because nimona can destroy Gita (109:38 - 109:42)
doesn't mean that she can be a challenge (109:41 - 109:44)
for you like there's there's different (109:42 - 109:48)
levels of like uh skill that would mean (109:44 - 109:50)
different things uh I don't know if I'm (109:48 - 109:53)
explaining this properly but like the uh (109:50 - 109:56)
strategy that would defeat Gita really (109:53 - 109:58)
easily (109:56 - 110:00)
wouldn't necessarily be a strategy that (109:58 - 110:03)
would even be difficult for you to (110:00 - 110:06)
overcome because different people (110:03 - 110:08)
battle in different ways and have (110:06 - 110:10)
different (110:08 - 110:14)
teams you know sure sure I I get what (110:10 - 110:15)
you're saying though I I understand but (110:14 - 110:17)
like I I don't think it would be that (110:15 - 110:19)
odd for some one person to defeat one (110:17 - 110:21)
person I'll really easily and then a (110:19 - 110:24)
third person to find them both roughly (110:21 - 110:27)
equal difficulty yeah yeah no I see what (110:24 - 110:30)
you're saying yeah and I think like (110:27 - 110:33)
it's also funny because the pneumonia (110:30 - 110:35)
talks about how a couple times how she (110:33 - 110:38)
establishes her team based off of what (110:35 - 110:39)
she's going to face (110:38 - 110:42)
so like (110:39 - 110:44)
she hints that like the hint is that she (110:42 - 110:46)
did that for Gita like she came in with (110:44 - 110:49)
the perfect team to blow her away and I (110:46 - 110:52)
do agree I sort of wish that (110:49 - 110:55)
it could have read what my team was and (110:52 - 110:57)
had like had her prepared the exact same (110:55 - 111:00)
way but instead she kept the starter (110:57 - 111:02)
that's weak to mine yeah that didn't (111:00 - 111:05)
really change much so I felt like again (111:02 - 111:08)
this is a harder thing to do but it (111:05 - 111:11)
would have been nice if that promise of (111:08 - 111:14)
her creating a team specifically to face (111:11 - 111:17)
a challenge would have also applied to (111:14 - 111:18)
me (111:17 - 111:20)
yeah I think I think the reason that (111:18 - 111:22)
they they that she chooses the start of (111:20 - 111:25)
this week to use because she's trying to (111:22 - 111:27)
make it more difficult for her as you go (111:25 - 111:28)
through the story yeah she makes that (111:27 - 111:30)
very clear to you but like automatically (111:28 - 111:32)
that makes sense (111:30 - 111:32)
yeah (111:32 - 111:37)
but from her own personality in (111:32 - 111:39)
in when you're facing the other gym (111:37 - 111:41)
leaders like I'm specifically building a (111:39 - 111:43)
team to deal with this (111:41 - 111:46)
yeah like she also says that and you (111:43 - 111:49)
have beaten her every time until now (111:46 - 111:52)
yeah yeah it'd be like okay I now know (111:49 - 111:54)
what your team is I am going to (111:52 - 111:56)
specifically build a team like I've done (111:54 - 111:58)
for everybody else to deal with you yeah (111:56 - 111:59)
and she doesn't (111:58 - 112:01)
yeah I mean that can be that can be that (111:59 - 112:03)
that seems almost impossible game (112:01 - 112:06)
building I know I I I I understand like (112:03 - 112:08)
from a gaming programming perspective (112:06 - 112:12)
that is a lot to ask it's just I wish (112:08 - 112:14)
that could happen (112:12 - 112:16)
yeah they could have easily done (112:14 - 112:18)
something where like you know why why (112:16 - 112:21)
does clavel need to keep this like could (112:18 - 112:23)
she go back and and get the starter (112:21 - 112:24)
that's stronger to yours it wouldn't be (112:23 - 112:26)
the most difficult thing ever but it (112:24 - 112:28)
would would increase that level and then (112:26 - 112:30)
you'd be surprised by that right you'd (112:28 - 112:32)
go into that final battle and oh she has (112:30 - 112:34)
the third one as well right sort of (112:32 - 112:35)
thing but no they give that to clavel (112:34 - 112:38)
instead which no fine sure makes some (112:35 - 112:40)
sort of sense but I mean I I do get the (112:38 - 112:44)
theme of like she's she wants a (112:40 - 112:45)
challenge so she makes it challenging (112:44 - 112:47)
for I mean I did the same thing right I (112:45 - 112:49)
picked all water Pokemon you know things (112:47 - 112:50)
some gyms were harder than others (112:49 - 112:52)
because of the choices I made yeah she's (112:50 - 112:53)
making a choice to pick the starter week (112:52 - 112:56)
to yours so it's harder for her so she (112:53 - 112:56)
can (112:56 - 112:59)
truly feel the sense of battle (112:56 - 113:02)
um right but like (112:59 - 113:04)
yeah I mean if she's supposed to be (113:02 - 113:07)
building a team to challenge you and you (113:04 - 113:08)
look at like (113:07 - 113:10)
there is no changes to anyone's team (113:08 - 113:12)
right like she's using always losing (113:10 - 113:13)
like and rock she's always using good or (113:12 - 113:15)
she's uh these are good Pokemon and (113:13 - 113:19)
they're fine it's just uh again not the (113:15 - 113:21)
end of the world I just (113:19 - 113:24)
I expected a bigger jump from Gita to (113:21 - 113:26)
her I think both battles are fun I think (113:24 - 113:30)
both battles had decent strategies (113:26 - 113:32)
um I just kind of like (113:30 - 113:35)
you you crush her so many times I was (113:32 - 113:37)
just hoping that that final battle (113:35 - 113:39)
there'd be like almost like a Twist or (113:37 - 113:41)
something yeah there's no room no it's a (113:39 - 113:43)
straight line (113:41 - 113:47)
um and it's fine it's fine uh like I (113:43 - 113:49)
think I think to close off this episode (113:47 - 113:51)
um (113:49 - 113:54)
our 30 minute episode I I Hannah said (113:51 - 113:56)
these for 30 minutes I think the whole (113:54 - 114:01)
gym experience here is safer than it (113:56 - 114:05)
needs to be but from going from Sun and (114:01 - 114:06)
Moon (114:05 - 114:08)
to ultra sun and moon (114:06 - 114:12)
to uh sword and shield (114:08 - 114:14)
I kind of think that's what they were (114:12 - 114:16)
going for like we need to bring back (114:14 - 114:18)
this traditional experience and it was (114:16 - 114:21)
exactly kind of what it was right like (114:18 - 114:23)
there there's not there's not anything (114:21 - 114:26)
that's (114:23 - 114:26)
like oh you refresh the gym experience (114:26 - 114:30)
but I I don't think they were going for (114:28 - 114:32)
that because I and the reason I say I (114:30 - 114:33)
don't think they were going for that is (114:32 - 114:34)
because they have Titans and they have (114:33 - 114:36)
Team star and they did new things there (114:34 - 114:39)
and this felt very traditional and yeah (114:36 - 114:41)
which is totally okay and I just hope (114:39 - 114:43)
that like next game (114:41 - 114:45)
I would love to see and I ate gems I (114:43 - 114:47)
would love to see an Elite Four I don't (114:45 - 114:48)
have problems with those structures but (114:47 - 114:50)
I would love to see (114:48 - 114:53)
some steps forward (114:50 - 114:53)
yeah (114:54 - 114:57)
because this was nice it was nice to (114:56 - 114:59)
revisit but also like been there done (114:57 - 115:02)
that yep (114:59 - 115:02)
yeah I didn't I didn't expect to be (115:03 - 115:07)
slightly disappointed by it but like (115:04 - 115:10)
just the standard gym but yeah I mean I (115:07 - 115:12)
can't I can't like Greg I can't get over (115:10 - 115:14)
how exciting the sword and shield (115:12 - 115:16)
battles were (115:14 - 115:19)
like there aren't there is there's well (115:16 - 115:20)
I think it is partly to do with the (115:19 - 115:21)
music and partly to do with it because (115:20 - 115:24)
like I I generally don't have sound on (115:21 - 115:26)
during games (115:24 - 115:29)
um obviously I had it on during uh (115:26 - 115:31)
Legends Arceus because I need to make (115:29 - 115:33)
sure I don't miss a shiny (115:31 - 115:35)
um but I don't generally have it on but (115:33 - 115:37)
I did have it on when I went into Gym (115:35 - 115:39)
Battles and Sergeant Shield every single (115:37 - 115:43)
time every time because it's so good (115:39 - 115:45)
yeah (115:43 - 115:48)
I mean it's so hard like they they kind (115:45 - 115:50)
of work themselves in a corner the the (115:48 - 115:53)
sword and shield Muse gym music is so (115:50 - 115:55)
top tier this is why they won't release (115:53 - 115:57)
the soundtrack they can't put that out (115:55 - 116:01)
into the world and and like (115:57 - 116:03)
there are the music in this game is (116:01 - 116:05)
incredible yeah it is and if the sword (116:03 - 116:07)
and shield gym music didn't exist I (116:05 - 116:09)
would I would say like oh the gym (116:07 - 116:10)
music's really good it's just not good (116:09 - 116:12)
because of the sword and shield music (116:10 - 116:14)
but it's like not a bad song it's fine (116:12 - 116:19)
it's just it's so overshadowed by that (116:14 - 116:20)
one song (116:19 - 116:21)
um (116:20 - 116:24)
which is like it's there's only I think (116:21 - 116:27)
there's only one bad song in this game (116:24 - 116:29)
and it's the like the the final (116:27 - 116:31)
tournament stuff that you do post game (116:29 - 116:33)
like that song is off oh I haven't (116:31 - 116:34)
actually done that one yet I I would I (116:33 - 116:36)
argue that the westerny theme I hate (116:34 - 116:40)
that thing so much I hate it to my very (116:36 - 116:42)
core people weren't happy that we hadn't (116:40 - 116:45)
we didn't discuss Penny's music and uh (116:42 - 116:48)
oh Penny's business (116:45 - 116:48)
I mean like when I was talking about it (116:48 - 116:53)
is amazing like they did a really great (116:50 - 116:56)
job with the soundtrack like it can (116:53 - 116:59)
I need to take a break we cannot dissect (116:56 - 117:00)
the entire soundtrack yeah yeah yeah (116:59 - 117:01)
yeah (117:00 - 117:04)
um so that next next episode will be (117:01 - 117:06)
area zero and I will last thing I want (117:04 - 117:09)
to say in in 10 seconds is for the team (117:06 - 117:10)
star stuff I didn't talk about how I (117:09 - 117:12)
like their clothing they all had (117:10 - 117:14)
specific pokeballs I love their music (117:12 - 117:15)
like there were a lot more things (117:14 - 117:18)
besides the story that helped pull me in (117:15 - 117:19)
that we didn't talk about I think I (117:18 - 117:21)
commented to somebody like these are the (117:19 - 117:22)
other things I didn't get to mention (117:21 - 117:25)
again there's a lot I liked about team (117:22 - 117:28)
SAR like there are many things I liked (117:25 - 117:30)
about them (117:28 - 117:32)
I also didn't like a big section of it (117:30 - 117:35)
so like (117:32 - 117:35)
you could you you already added me all (117:35 - 117:40)
