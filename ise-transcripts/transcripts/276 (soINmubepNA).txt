[Music] (0:02 - 0:24)
what's up everyone welcome to the 276 (0:20 - 0:27)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:24 - 0:31)
super effective I am your host SBJ and (0:27 - 0:34)
with me today I have will yes it was (0:31 - 0:36)
very exciting day yesterday one of my (0:34 - 0:39)
co-workers had a baby yesterday and that (0:36 - 0:40)
is the most important thing that (0:39 - 0:44)
happened yesterday Oh interesting yes (0:40 - 0:49)
okay all right we also have Travis here (0:44 - 0:52)
you know getting to listen to the (0:49 - 0:56)
Pokemon go-fast episode as an outsider (0:52 - 0:58)
looking in has really made me (0:56 - 1:00)
disappointed and unless I missed (0:58 - 1:03)
something I think all of the listeners (1:00 - 1:06)
were dying to hear whether or not you (1:03 - 1:09)
did in fact used the museum bathroom Oh (1:06 - 1:12)
III think you didn't miss something cuz (1:09 - 1:14)
I did mention that he didn't get the (1:12 - 1:16)
pass oh but it was like a real quick (1:14 - 1:19)
deal II but but can you explain yourself (1:16 - 1:24)
yeah I I used so bathroom update on (1:19 - 1:25)
Pokemon go (1:24 - 1:29)
I used the port-a-potty or you know just (1:25 - 1:32)
your basic necessity standing only for (1:29 - 1:35)
men before the park opened so I was (1:32 - 1:39)
clear in the fact that no one has used (1:35 - 1:43)
these yet and then later on in the day I (1:39 - 1:45)
found a hidden bathroom (1:43 - 1:48)
in the parking garage structure which (1:45 - 1:52)
was not as clean as I preferred but it (1:48 - 1:55)
was very private and it the the toilet (1:52 - 1:57)
the job done the toilet there flushed (1:55 - 1:59)
and that's what's important in that (1:57 - 2:02)
situation but but what did that bathroom (1:59 - 2:06)
lack well the you said you said the door (2:02 - 2:08)
was broken because you also found the (2:06 - 2:10)
bathroom and while I read the doors it's (2:08 - 2:12)
like a it's like a hidden Zelda thing (2:10 - 2:14)
that you have to do a couple of tricks (2:12 - 2:16)
to get to you found the bathroom I found (2:14 - 2:19)
the bathroom and I used my car keys to (2:16 - 2:21)
lock the door yes (2:19 - 2:24)
sorry had to manipulate the lock on the (2:21 - 2:28)
on the little swinging door so that it (2:24 - 2:32)
would stay stay lost for you I also do (2:28 - 2:33)
that okay so you know how in the back (2:32 - 2:36)
through like the stalls never go to the (2:33 - 2:38)
floor and then you're supposed to (2:36 - 2:42)
ideally like look under the stall to see (2:38 - 2:44)
if somebody's feet are there as far as I (2:42 - 2:46)
understand it depends on the country (2:44 - 2:49)
apparently the u.s. is kind of odd and (2:46 - 2:50)
having that style of stall where the (2:49 - 2:52)
stall wall does not go all the way down (2:50 - 2:54)
to the floor yeah I think I think it's (2:52 - 2:55)
weird overall I like I get it (2:54 - 2:57)
because if maybe you got stuck in it you (2:55 - 3:00)
can curl under is that really where your (2:57 - 3:03)
mind goes of getting stuck in a bathroom (3:00 - 3:08)
stall yes no no I I mean I've thought (3:03 - 3:10)
about that situation of like oh if I get (3:08 - 3:12)
stuck in here I can just crawl (3:10 - 3:15)
underneath as I'm sure we all have as we (3:12 - 3:18)
all do some days but I'm thinking oh (3:15 - 3:21)
this is so I can look at the stall and (3:18 - 3:23)
see somebody's feet and call like okay (3:21 - 3:24)
cool (3:23 - 3:27)
somebody's in there me as a paranoid (3:24 - 3:30)
public bathroom user not really paranoid (3:27 - 3:34)
but I've been in situations where I was (3:30 - 3:36)
very young in like a public school (3:34 - 3:39)
possibly or not possibly MPs where (3:36 - 3:42)
people just push open the stall and (3:39 - 3:45)
normally that the lock on those stalls (3:42 - 3:47)
aren't strong enough to stop somebody (3:45 - 3:50)
from pushing it so ever since a child (3:47 - 3:53)
what I do is I take my jacket or hoodie (3:50 - 3:58)
or sweater and I throw it over the stall (3:53 - 4:00)
door the so for the people who don't (3:58 - 4:02)
take the two seconds to look for feet (4:00 - 4:05)
they will see a a garment of clothing (4:02 - 4:09)
hanging over the stall signifying that (4:05 - 4:12)
it is occupied that's how your clothes (4:09 - 4:15)
get stolen it's true I'm the most (4:12 - 4:17)
defenseless in the bathroom so somebody (4:15 - 4:20)
could easily steal my hoodie also don't (4:17 - 4:22)
you wear like $600 jeans or something (4:20 - 4:26)
yeah yeah hopefully he's not throwing (4:22 - 4:31)
those over didn't think that through if (4:26 - 4:33)
I'm throwing jeans over the door that (4:31 - 4:35)
means I'm taking my shoes off and then (4:33 - 4:38)
we now we have a whole nother can this (4:35 - 4:42)
is a Pokemon pie yes to everyone we got (4:38 - 4:44)

well at least according to Wikipedia (8:30 - 8:36)
they're in the level of least concern in (8:34 - 8:38)
terms of conservation status so it (8:36 - 8:41)
shouldn't be too sad Pokemon go update (8:38 - 8:44)
here in regards to Milwaukee parks we've (8:41 - 8:47)
been following this story very hard (8:44 - 8:49)
since it started since I'm from (8:47 - 8:52)
Milwaukee but this is off the BBC I (8:49 - 8:53)
suppose I could have found another (8:52 - 8:56)
source but hey while AB is the BBC is so (8:53 - 9:01)
incredibly unreliable as since it (8:56 - 9:03)
started right up there with the Drudge (9:01 - 9:09)
Report rules designed to stop pokemon (9:03 - 9:12)
hunters over running parks in Milwaukee (9:09 - 9:14)
County has been suspended (9:12 - 9:18)
following a legal change Milwaukee parks (9:14 - 9:20)
appeared in Pokemon go as pokey stops (9:18 - 9:22)
real-world location players visit (9:20 - 9:25)
together in games items but officials (9:22 - 9:27)
said the volume of players had (9:25 - 9:29)
unintended consequences and ordered game (9:27 - 9:33)
makers to apply for permits including to (9:29 - 9:35)
include parks in their apps the order (9:33 - 9:38)
will be suspended while legal change is (9:35 - 9:41)
considered now this is mostly regard to (9:38 - 9:46)
Lake Park where there was 21 polka stops (9:41 - 9:49)
there the complaints happened nante (9:46 - 9:52)
didn't respond it went to a couple what (9:49 - 9:54)
do they call those like hearings where (9:52 - 9:57)
people could show up and plead if they (9:54 - 10:00)
public hearings yeah they wanted poke I (9:57 - 10:03)
kicked myself all the time for not going (10:00 - 10:05)
to those because it sounded like it was (10:03 - 10:07)
pretty close but it pretty much was (10:05 - 10:09)
people coming and saying that this were (10:07 - 10:11)
ruining the parts parks and then other (10:09 - 10:13)
people coming and saying that no this is (10:11 - 10:16)
really good for the parks anyways it (10:13 - 10:19)
went from 21 Park 21 stops at Lake Park (10:16 - 10:22)
to about nine stops after the removal (10:19 - 10:25)
happened from the antic which I still (10:22 - 10:27)
don't think they commented on anyways (10:25 - 10:30)
BBC goes on and says several landmarks (10:27 - 10:32)
in the in Milwaukee parks were included (10:30 - 10:35)
as points of interest in Pokemon go when (10:32 - 10:38)
it launched in 2016 the Milwaukee County (10:35 - 10:40)
Park Service said a number of players (10:38 - 10:42)
had increased littering in the park (10:40 - 10:45)
overwhelmed toilet facilities and it all (10:42 - 10:48)
resulted in trampled grass game (10:45 - 10:51)
companies must detail on how they will (10:48 - 10:53)
deal with security waste collection and (10:51 - 10:56)
toilet provision as well as part of the (10:53 - 11:00)
application process critics said the (10:56 - 11:03)
requirement might stifle the development (11:00 - 11:05)
of mixed reality games which companies (11:03 - 11:07)
such as Microsoft and Apple are (11:05 - 11:10)
investing in in April a legal challenge (11:07 - 11:13)
was brought by a company called candy (11:10 - 11:16)
lab the company does not make Pokemon go (11:13 - 11:18)
but it is a developer of a poker app (11:16 - 11:20)
that encourages players to visit (11:18 - 11:23)
real-world locations it said video games (11:20 - 11:24)
that were protected under the First (11:23 - 11:27)
Amendment right to freedom of speech and (11:24 - 11:28)
claimed the park (11:27 - 11:30)
ordiance violated that right a (11:28 - 11:34)
preliminary injunction was granted on (11:30 - 11:36)
Thursday so the permit required can no (11:34 - 11:37)
longer be enforced until the case is (11:36 - 11:40)
heard and there you go there's your (11:37 - 11:44)
Milwaukee this isn't adding stops back (11:40 - 11:46)
to the park though which at this point I (11:44 - 11:48)
don't know what you guys think but in (11:46 - 11:50)
the antique hasn't said anything antic (11:48 - 11:52)
went ahead and remove some stops this (11:50 - 11:55)
other company comes in says that it's a (11:52 - 11:57)
First Amendment right permit is no (11:55 - 11:59)
longer enforced but I don't think me (11:57 - 12:02)
antics are gonna add those twelve stops (11:59 - 12:04)
back all of a sudden no soon I think (12:02 - 12:06)
they've got yeah I was gonna say you can (12:04 - 12:08)
you can look at it legally now that (12:06 - 12:11)
Milwaukee's first action had a chilling (12:08 - 12:14)
effect and it will dampen future (12:11 - 12:16)
investment in such opportunities in (12:14 - 12:19)
Milwaukee yeah that that's that's a good (12:16 - 12:21)
point you could certainly see it that (12:19 - 12:22)
way that people will say like well why (12:21 - 12:25)
would I want to work with Milwaukee if (12:22 - 12:30)
they're so hostile to this type of thing (12:25 - 12:34)
I think y'all would probably agree with (12:30 - 12:36)
me when I say Danny antic probably has (12:34 - 12:39)
more important things on the docket than (12:36 - 12:41)
worrying about adding stops back to Lake (12:39 - 12:46)
Park in Milwaukee Wisconsin it just (12:41 - 12:49)
seems like it to them like I don't see (12:46 - 12:52)
them caring too much about it not (12:49 - 12:54)
because like they don't care about users (12:52 - 12:56)
but just because it's such a small (12:54 - 12:58)
percentage of users who would be (12:56 - 13:01)
impacted by that yeah and at this point (12:58 - 13:04)
hardcore poke [ __ ] players in Milwaukee (13:01 - 13:06)
have found other places some more (13:04 - 13:08)
Pokemon news here all right well we'll (13:06 - 13:12)
do this one first so this is July 25th (13:08 - 13:16)
three days after Pokemon go fest ended (13:12 - 13:19)
this is an update specifically from John (13:16 - 13:23)
Hanke the CEO so there's some news in (13:19 - 13:25)
regards here but they wanted to write a (13:23 - 13:28)
letter about the about how the fest went (13:25 - 13:32)
and before before I read this Travis you (13:28 - 13:33)
weren't there and you said you listened (13:32 - 13:36)
to the episode what did what for for (13:33 - 13:38)
somebody not going to fess and then (13:36 - 13:40)
hearing that episode what what was your (13:38 - 13:42)
thoughts or takeaways from that (13:40 - 13:44)
I mean sounds like it was a bust like (13:42 - 13:47)
yeah at the end of the episode y'all (13:44 - 13:48)
were saying stuff like you know at in (13:47 - 13:52)
the end I had a good time overall and in (13:48 - 13:54)
the end it felt worth it just to hang (13:52 - 13:56)
out with people and and some of the (13:54 - 13:59)
stuff near the end was executed better (13:56 - 14:02)
but to me hearing that like that just (13:59 - 14:07)
sounds like a PR disaster for the game (14:02 - 14:11)
just in my last job I put on a lot of or (14:07 - 14:14)
not put on myself but part of my job was (14:11 - 14:15)
helping put on these public if I publish (14:14 - 14:18)
offends not quite like this at all but (14:15 - 14:22)
it certainly did give me um a lot of (14:18 - 14:25)
like vicarious stress for that for the (14:22 - 14:27)
people who end up with this event on and (14:25 - 14:28)
just hearing all the things that went (14:27 - 14:31)
wrong was cool boy I don't envy those (14:28 - 14:34)
the Niantic folks I don't envy the folks (14:31 - 14:36)
who spent a lot of money on a plane (14:34 - 14:38)
ticket to get there that it just seems (14:36 - 14:40)
like a rough situation all around (14:38 - 14:42)
I'm sure Niantic thought there would be (14:40 - 14:44)
issues but I don't think they thought (14:42 - 14:46)
that they would be down for the entire (14:44 - 14:51)
day well it's like six all right so this (14:46 - 14:54)
is again from John Hanke during Pokemon (14:51 - 14:57)
go fest 2017 in Chicago we encountered (14:54 - 14:59)
software and network problems that (14:57 - 15:01)
prevented many people from being able to (14:59 - 15:02)
connect to the game players were (15:01 - 15:04)
disappointed with their experiences that (15:02 - 15:06)
morning and we heard boos and shouts (15:04 - 15:08)
from the crowd we'd like to update you (15:06 - 15:11)
on what caused these issues while our (15:08 - 15:13)
technical team worked diligently with (15:11 - 15:16)
our event vendor and telecommunication (15:13 - 15:18)
companies to attempt to resolve the (15:16 - 15:20)
issues I spent nearly the entire day (15:18 - 15:23)
talking face to face with into attendees (15:20 - 15:25)
so did much of the team of the Niantic (15:23 - 15:28)
staff who came to Chicago to support the (15:25 - 15:30)
event during the hours I spent talking (15:28 - 15:32)
to n attendees I passed on the (15:30 - 15:35)
information we had communicated of our (15:32 - 15:38)
policy and refunds and game credits once (15:35 - 15:40)
we had them but mostly I listened to (15:38 - 15:42)
what players had to say certainly many (15:40 - 15:44)
were upset and I did my best to listen (15:42 - 15:47)
and offer any assistance I could some (15:44 - 15:49)
were able to play normally more on that (15:47 - 15:52)
later and more than a few unknown (15:49 - 15:55)
pokemon were captured by those gathering (15:52 - 15:56)
around to (15:55 - 15:59)
Hauk among those who came up to me many (15:56 - 16:01)
shared stories of how important the game (15:59 - 16:03)
was to them some talked about losing (16:01 - 16:05)
weight others talked about a path to (16:03 - 16:07)
recovery after a serious illness and (16:05 - 16:10)
some talked about repaired relationships (16:07 - 16:13)
with children siblings and parents many (16:10 - 16:15)
friends many groups of friends who had (16:13 - 16:17)
traveled together to talked about how (16:15 - 16:19)
the shared bond the game created for (16:17 - 16:21)
them for those stories I am grateful (16:19 - 16:23)
because it was obviously incredibly (16:21 - 16:25)
stressful and disappointing day for all (16:23 - 16:29)
of us both I personally and then and all (16:25 - 16:30)
of Niantic apologize for the (16:29 - 16:33)
inconvenience and frustration what (16:30 - 16:34)
happened (16:33 - 16:36)
technical issues with our game software (16:34 - 16:38)
caused the client to crash and (16:36 - 16:40)
interfered with the gameplay for some (16:38 - 16:40)
users (16:40 - 16:42)
the gameplay issues were resolved with a (16:40 - 16:45)
server configuration changed and the (16:42 - 16:47)
crashes were also addressed for many but (16:45 - 16:50)
not all users a more protracted problem (16:47 - 16:54)
was caused by over saturation of mobile (16:50 - 16:56)
data networks and some network providers (16:54 - 16:58)
this caused many attendees to be unable (16:56 - 17:01)
to access pokemon go or other Internet (16:58 - 17:04)
services network congestion also led to (17:01 - 17:08)
a login issue which affected some users (17:04 - 17:10)
being able to access the Internet this (17:08 - 17:13)
laitanan this latency related login (17:10 - 17:15)
issue was addressed with a second (17:13 - 17:18)
Niantic configuration change well I (17:15 - 17:19)
don't know if you got this (17:18 - 17:22)
I remember the not being able to login (17:19 - 17:25)
that only lasted like 25 minutes a half (17:22 - 17:29)
hour maybe yeah yeah that that was not (17:25 - 17:31)
the the length of the day it was really (17:29 - 17:33)
like after you were logged in either (17:31 - 17:37)
getting kicked out or just like pokey (17:33 - 17:40)
stops not loading or you're trying to (17:37 - 17:42)
capture Pokemon and you throw the ball (17:40 - 17:45)
and it just like crashes at that point (17:42 - 17:47)
so people were in they just couldn't do (17:45 - 17:49)
stuff once they were in it was almost I (17:47 - 17:51)
think it was what they said here after (17:49 - 17:53)
the first update it went smoothly and (17:51 - 17:54)
then all of a sudden no one could even (17:53 - 17:57)
log in and that lasted for about 25 (17:54 - 17:59)
minutes and then people could log in but (17:57 - 18:01)
then it was back to the the first issue (17:59 - 18:04)
of nothing actually loading continuing (18:01 - 18:07)
this on the peer network access issue we (18:04 - 18:09)
provided details estimates on attendance (18:07 - 18:09)
and (18:09 - 18:12)
acquired data throughout per-user to our (18:09 - 18:15)
event partner who worked with the major (18:12 - 18:17)
carriers to allow them to plan for (18:15 - 18:21)
adequate coverage some carriers deployed (18:17 - 18:24)
cellular on wheels cows to extend their (18:21 - 18:27)
capacity in other cases the providers (18:24 - 18:29)
deemed them unnecessary based on their (18:27 - 18:31)
other inference truck infrastructure (18:29 - 18:34)
already in place on the site users (18:31 - 18:36)
reported different levels of success on (18:34 - 18:39)
these providers Wi-Fi was enabled by one (18:36 - 18:41)
provider as a solution which helped some (18:39 - 18:45)
users but not all sprint was an on-site (18:41 - 18:47)
official partner deployed a cow and (18:45 - 18:50)
their network was busy but held up well (18:47 - 18:52)
although many players were able to play (18:50 - 18:54)
normally for the majority of the day (18:52 - 18:58)
many were not and based on that we had a (18:54 - 19:01)
number of adjustments to the event plan (18:58 - 19:03)
okay so let's break down in this (19:01 - 19:04)
paragraph because I think this is the (19:03 - 19:08)
first bit of new information hanky says (19:04 - 19:10)
that some some cellular networks (19:08 - 19:13)
provided cows I'm pretty sure we only (19:10 - 19:15)
know that one did which was sprint they (19:13 - 19:18)
provided one cellular on wheels (19:15 - 19:21)
and they did talk about how one provider (19:18 - 19:24)
provided Wi-Fi we know who that was for (19:21 - 19:28)
sure that was 18 t yeah definitely where (19:24 - 19:30)
you could pick it up which yeah 18 t (19:28 - 19:33)
provider Wi-Fi 8 worked pretty much for (19:30 - 19:35)
me flawlessly throughout the event (19:33 - 19:38)
except for the 25 minutes with a no (19:35 - 19:41)
login issue but if I was on 18 T Wi-Fi I (19:38 - 19:43)
had no problem playing the game for the (19:41 - 19:45)
most of the day but that Wi-Fi only (19:43 - 19:49)
covered maybe 1/8 of the park yeah if (19:45 - 19:53)
even that much yeah but I yeah I didn't (19:49 - 19:55)
see any other cells on wheels so unless (19:53 - 19:58)
they had them outside the big gates like (19:55 - 20:00)
and didn't bring them on the inside (19:58 - 20:02)
because I don't know what they look like (20:00 - 20:05)
well it looks like do you know what a (20:02 - 20:10)
cell tower looks like like radio tower (20:05 - 20:12)
do you know have you ever seen like a (20:10 - 20:16)
cherry picker yeah yeah a cherry picker (20:12 - 20:18)
alright so it's smaller than that but (20:16 - 20:20)
similar in that it kind of like extends (20:18 - 20:23)
up like that but here's the trick (20:20 - 20:25)
there's usually cables coming out of it (20:23 - 20:29)
that hard link into a you know the wired (20:25 - 20:32)
internet like it doesn't it's not (20:29 - 20:35)
freestanding you have to have white you (20:32 - 20:36)
know cables coming out of it that go to (20:35 - 20:39)
the carriers actual physical (20:36 - 20:42)
infrastructure so that's how you notice (20:39 - 20:44)
them because you see those cables going (20:42 - 20:46)
out and being like they're really really (20:44 - 20:48)
thick cables and they go off to either (20:46 - 20:50)
like a manhole so they can go (20:48 - 20:52)
underground to where like the fiber (20:50 - 20:55)
networks and what are the little things (20:52 - 20:57)
call that the phone companies have Wow (20:55 - 21:00)
my terminal in my head no no no no no (20:57 - 21:03)
it's it's the stations where all the (21:00 - 21:05)
telephones get together into one place (21:03 - 21:09)
well there's a term for phone con 2016 (21:05 - 21:15)
yeah exactly the hub it's not a hub it's (21:09 - 21:17)
got a really it like these called like (21:15 - 21:19)
this central exchange or the central off (21:17 - 21:20)
I think it's just called the central (21:19 - 21:21)
office there's one of them up the street (21:20 - 21:23)
for me when you come visit me I'll point (21:21 - 21:26)
it out to you but they've got a hook (21:23 - 21:28)
into the wired infrastructure somehow (21:26 - 21:30)
and then that tower can then augment (21:28 - 21:33)
cellular but but you know still (21:30 - 21:35)
transporting it into the wired so not (21:33 - 21:38)
seeing any towers with cables thick (21:35 - 21:40)
cables coming out of them and going into (21:38 - 21:43)
hidden secret underground chambers to me (21:40 - 21:45)
means they weren't there unless they (21:43 - 21:47)
were outside of the park because you (21:45 - 21:49)
know we were inside that gated area of (21:47 - 21:51)
the park which I never mentioned was (21:49 - 21:53)
truly impressive to me that they can (21:51 - 21:57)
throw up an ad-hoc fence around that (21:53 - 21:59)
entire size of that park unit like that (21:57 - 22:02)
fence is removable yeah yeah it's pretty (21:59 - 22:05)
amazing to me going back on the peer (22:02 - 22:07)
network access issue we provided (22:05 - 22:09)
detailed estimates on attendance and (22:07 - 22:13)
required data throughout per user to our (22:09 - 22:15)
event partner who worked with the (22:13 - 22:17)
majority characters to allow them to a (22:15 - 22:20)
plan for adequate coverage is the event (22:17 - 22:23)
partner Grant Park is that that is that (22:20 - 22:26)
the situation there no I think it's (22:23 - 22:28)
whatever company did actual event (22:26 - 22:30)
production because obviously Atlantic is (22:28 - 22:32)
not a specialist in event production so (22:30 - 22:34)
it's whatever that company was there (22:32 - 22:36)
there are people who actually specialize (22:34 - 22:37)
in even (22:36 - 22:38)
management and putting these kinds of (22:37 - 22:41)
things on well clearly not after this oh (22:38 - 22:43)
and the words that you were going for (22:41 - 22:46)
their throughput and carrier yeah that's (22:43 - 22:47)
what I said (22:46 - 22:50)
there you go it's just frustrating and (22:47 - 22:52)
I'm sure it's even more frustrating for (22:50 - 22:55)
nee antic to say hey we're gonna have a (22:52 - 22:59)
lot of people here twenty thousand to be (22:55 - 23:02)
to be accurate because even even when we (22:59 - 23:04)
were talking to the producer will (23:02 - 23:07)
somebody another reporter was like how (23:04 - 23:09)
many people are here and the producer (23:07 - 23:12)
was like less than twenty thousand and (23:09 - 23:14)
she's like can I get an exact number and (23:12 - 23:17)
he's like our permit allowed for up to (23:14 - 23:19)
twenty thousand people there were no (23:17 - 23:21)
more than twenty thousand people in this (23:19 - 23:23)
part and that and then he also said that (23:21 - 23:26)
includes staff Oh interesting cuz they (23:23 - 23:29)
probably had about probably 200 minimum (23:26 - 23:32)
but still that's nineteen thousand eight (23:29 - 23:36)
hundred people players I just submit (23:32 - 23:38)
there was a horrible miscommunication (23:36 - 23:42)
somewhere or somebody like did the very (23:38 - 23:45)
arbitrary oh this really isn't that (23:42 - 23:47)
important decision and it turns out to (23:45 - 23:49)
the that was the most important of all (23:47 - 23:52)
the decision but even if you're in the (23:49 - 23:54)
antic and they come back i none of us (23:52 - 23:57)
had verizon here but I'm pretty sure (23:54 - 24:00)
Verizon had the most issues because (23:57 - 24:01)
Irene was on Sprint and Irene was (24:00 - 24:05)
playing more than most of us were like I (24:01 - 24:06)
said the eighteen t wife I work for me (24:05 - 24:09)
if you're in the antic and Verizon comes (24:06 - 24:12)
back and tells the event partner now we (24:09 - 24:13)
don't need to bring out a cow and the (24:12 - 24:16)
event partner tells the antic hey we're (24:13 - 24:18)
not like Verizon's not bringing out a (24:16 - 24:21)
cow orange don't you as the antic push (24:18 - 24:25)
back and say we don't we'll pay for the (24:21 - 24:28)
cow just bring the cow out anyways like (24:25 - 24:30)
who's lying and I'm Verizon for the USA (24:28 - 24:33)
I mean typically you don't have to pay (24:30 - 24:34)
for them because the carrier's want (24:33 - 24:36)
their network to work where people are (24:34 - 24:38)
but the response from Verizon is going (24:36 - 24:40)
to be don't have a cow man (24:38 - 24:46)
my guess I imagine is the situation of (24:40 - 24:49)
that probably happened and that carriers (24:46 - 24:50)
still said (24:49 - 24:54)
though I mean you could see why from (24:50 - 24:58)
Verizon or AT&T or probably not sprint (24:54 - 25:00)
but the other twos perspectives like (24:58 - 25:02)
this probably doesn't seem that (25:00 - 25:06)
important to them you know like I don't (25:02 - 25:08)
yeah maybe that's just me as I say or (25:06 - 25:09)
they just didn't really believe that (25:08 - 25:11)
20,000 people were gonna play out yes (25:09 - 25:13)
show up to play Pokemon early in the (25:11 - 25:15)
afternoon we inform players that we (25:13 - 25:17)
could that we would refund tickets to (25:15 - 25:19)
those who wanted it and we would grant (25:17 - 25:22)
$100 USD and pokey coins to all (25:19 - 25:24)
attendees due to their inconvenience we (25:22 - 25:26)
also released the unique Pokemon (25:24 - 25:29)
spawning at the event to their (25:26 - 25:30)
surrounding neighborhoods to give people (25:29 - 25:32)
a way to catch them where their mobile (25:30 - 25:35)
network was stronger doesn't say here (25:32 - 25:37)
but they extended that radius to miles (25:35 - 25:40)
around Grant Park later in the afternoon (25:37 - 25:42)
we announced the winner of the challenge (25:40 - 25:44)
and let players know that all attendees (25:42 - 25:47)
would receive a legendary Pokemon in (25:44 - 25:50)
their accounts that was lugia in the (25:47 - 25:52)
early evening as part of planned (25:50 - 25:55)
gameplay update for all trainers (25:52 - 25:57)
globally we released legendary pokémon (25:55 - 25:59)
Articuno and lugia to spawn in the (25:57 - 26:03)
border area around downtown Chicago and (25:59 - 26:04)
around the world (26:03 - 26:06)
that's when Pokemon go trainers did (26:04 - 26:09)
something awesome as people filed out of (26:06 - 26:11)
the event into the surrounding areas (26:09 - 26:12)
where cellular network was less (26:11 - 26:15)
overburdened they were able to play (26:12 - 26:17)
together and capture legendary Pokemon (26:15 - 26:19)
in the wild it was inspiring to watch (26:17 - 26:21)
trainers band together with their (26:19 - 26:23)
friends to enjoy the beautiful the (26:21 - 26:25)
beautiful evening together despite the (26:23 - 26:27)
struggles of the day that spirit (26:25 - 26:29)
extended well into the night and resumed (26:27 - 26:31)
again the next day with clusters of (26:29 - 26:33)
Pokemon trainers roaming the city (26:31 - 26:36)
battling legendary Pokemon throughout (26:33 - 26:38)
the day on Sunday together from late (26:36 - 26:40)
Saturday to Sunday trainers in downtown (26:38 - 26:44)
Chicago participated in more than 69,000 (26:40 - 26:47)
raid battles and captured more than 7.7 (26:44 - 26:52)
million Pokemon including more than (26:47 - 26:55)
440,000 legendary Pokemon it was an (26:52 - 26:57)
amazing sight to behold and it is a (26:55 - 26:59)
testament to the love of the game and (26:57 - 27:01)
the bonds these trainers share with each (26:59 - 27:04)
other trainers from the world joined (27:01 - 27:04)
around as well (27:04 - 27:06)
during the same time period they (27:04 - 27:09)
participated in more than 4.6 million (27:06 - 27:12)
raid battles and caught more than 500 (27:09 - 27:15)
million pokemon including more than one (27:12 - 27:17)
point nine million legendary Pokemon at (27:15 - 27:20)
the same time we were struggling in (27:17 - 27:23)
Chicago an amazing event was unfolding (27:20 - 27:26)
in Chester UK organized by a partner big (27:23 - 27:30)
heritage more than 17,000 people visited (27:26 - 27:32)
that event over two days in one of (27:30 - 27:34)
England's oldest and most historic (27:32 - 27:36)
settings the combination of history and (27:34 - 27:39)
family orientated Pokemon go play was a (27:36 - 27:42)
hit we will be incorporating all our (27:39 - 27:44)
learnings into Pokemon go events planned (27:42 - 27:46)
for later the summer in Yokohama Japan (27:44 - 27:49)
and across Europe as these events unfold (27:46 - 27:52)
trainers a lot around the world will (27:49 - 27:54)
have a chance to capture even more (27:52 - 27:56)
legendary Pokemon based on the efforts (27:54 - 27:59)
Saturday at Pokemon go-fast lugia loot (27:56 - 28:02)
lugia lugia and Articuno were unlocked (27:59 - 28:04)
in the weeks ahead they will be joined (28:02 - 28:08)
by Moltres and Zapdos Articuno will be (28:04 - 28:11)
will be available from January 22nd to (28:08 - 28:13)
July 31st (28:11 - 28:17)
Moltres July 31st to August 7th and (28:13 - 28:21)
Zapdos on August 7th through August 14th (28:17 - 28:24)
finally last paragraph here real-world (28:21 - 28:26)
events are the core to the Niantic (28:24 - 28:29)
mission of exploration exercise and (28:26 - 28:31)
social interaction we've been doing this (28:29 - 28:35)
since the early days of ingress in 2012 (28:31 - 28:38)
those events group progressively larger (28:35 - 28:40)
over time starting with a few dozen in (28:38 - 28:43)
attendance growing to over 10,000 in (28:40 - 28:45)
Tokyo last summer and each stage of (28:43 - 28:47)
growth we've encountered challenges and (28:45 - 28:50)
each time we've overcame them we gained (28:47 - 28:52)
new skills and pioneered new techniques (28:50 - 28:55)
for building real world experiences that (28:52 - 28:57)
support our mission last Saturday was (28:55 - 28:59)
not a happy day for us but we are (28:57 - 29:01)
committed to listening to that feedback (28:59 - 29:04)
however harsh to improve that we can (29:01 - 29:06)
continue to build experiences and bring (29:04 - 29:09)
people together technology in the real (29:06 - 29:13)
world in innovative ways John Hanke so (29:09 - 29:15)
incredibly well written I think (29:13 - 29:18)
incredibly well said I think needed to (29:15 - 29:18)
be (29:18 - 29:21)
but will where your thoughts overall (29:18 - 29:24)
from this message from the antic I mean (29:21 - 29:26)
he's still expressing optimism and the (29:24 - 29:28)
fact that they're still committed to (29:26 - 29:30)
providing this game you know they're not (29:28 - 29:31)
throwing in the towel because everybody (29:30 - 29:33)
because it didn't work on that one (29:31 - 29:36)
Saturday they're actually planning you (29:33 - 29:38)
know I'm continuing having events and (29:36 - 29:40)
hopefully that those future events will (29:38 - 29:43)
be successful so yeah I mean I think (29:40 - 29:45)
it's it is well-written I think it's a (29:43 - 29:49)
good explanation but obviously you know (29:45 - 29:51)
when he says they invite whatever (29:49 - 29:55)
criticism ever harsh they're gonna get (29:51 - 30:00)
it and because trolls patrols and yeah I (29:55 - 30:02)
mean there's other news items I'm sure (30:00 - 30:04)
that are going to address that portion (30:02 - 30:06)
of it I don't know last week how much (30:04 - 30:08)
time he spent on it once the legendary (30:06 - 30:11)
so the legend the lugia was supposed to (30:08 - 30:13)
start at 6 p.m. and then the surprise (30:11 - 30:15)
was our takuna because team mystic one (30:13 - 30:18)
was also supposed to appear and that (30:15 - 30:21)
whole mystery event was from 6 p.m. to 7 (30:18 - 30:25)
p.m. and then the the fest was over at (30:21 - 30:27)
7:05 p.m. that's when the first (30:25 - 30:29)
legendary raid showed up which was lujah (30:27 - 30:32)
which was above the fountain near grant (30:29 - 30:35)
near Grant Park not in Grant Park what (30:32 - 30:39)
was said here in the blog post which I (30:35 - 30:42)
feel like if you're reading a Pokemon go (30:39 - 30:47)
article on on polygon or the verge or (30:42 - 30:51)
CNN or I know who everyone reported on (30:47 - 30:53)
this so whether wherever you're reading (30:51 - 30:55)
this article you're seeing Pokemon go (30:53 - 31:00)
fest in a negative light and for fair (30:55 - 31:04)
reasons with that whole weekend starting (31:00 - 31:07)
at 7:00 p.m. going into Sunday was just (31:04 - 31:10)
incredible and we'll you were there (31:07 - 31:13)
Saturday night but even like before we (31:10 - 31:13)
got to dinner (31:13 - 31:16)
even after dinner we played a ton of (31:13 - 31:19)
Pokemon go fest any Pokemon go and it (31:16 - 31:21)
was really good and really fun yeah you (31:19 - 31:23)
kept me there Saturday night that is (31:21 - 31:27)
true it was a good time like you call it (31:23 - 31:30)
fun I mean I gotta get before anybody (31:27 - 31:32)
else yeah before you got to the (31:30 - 31:34)
you walked in with a lujah and what like (31:32 - 31:36)
to Articuno her - no i walked in with (31:34 - 31:39)
two loogie as i still don't have an idea (31:36 - 31:43)
- Articuno zand swagger all the all the (31:39 - 31:46)
unknowns Irina and I went back to (31:43 - 31:49)
Chicago after we record so we recorded (31:46 - 31:53)
that podcast on Sunday morning we were (31:49 - 31:55)
we were recording for like three hours (31:53 - 31:56)
and we ended up with a two-hour episode (31:55 - 32:02)
and then we went to will myself I read (31:56 - 32:04)
mica we went to lunch (32:02 - 32:09)
got some good thin crust pizza oh oh I (32:04 - 32:11)
mean it was tasty but saying that it's (32:09 - 32:14)
good is really a put-down to other kinds (32:11 - 32:15)
of pizza in the world (32:14 - 32:18)
we then stopped at Mayfair Mall to see (32:15 - 32:20)
if there were raids there's an article (32:18 - 32:24)
and lugia there we learned firsthand how (32:20 - 32:26)
uncooperative Milwaukee people are when (32:24 - 32:29)
it comes to raids correct we quickly (32:26 - 32:32)
left that and then Myka took will to the (32:29 - 32:35)
airport Irene and I went back to Chicago (32:32 - 32:37)
so that's a it was about an hour and (32:35 - 32:40)
fifteen minute drive for me and because (32:37 - 32:42)
we went down during rush hour we parked (32:40 - 32:47)
and it was Sunday rush hour every day (32:42 - 32:50)
every hour of Chicago is rush hour and (32:47 - 32:52)
we did Pokemon go again we walked up to (32:50 - 32:55)
the giant Maleny millennium beam and (32:52 - 32:57)
there was a lugia there like right when (32:55 - 32:59)
we got out of the car we caught that we (32:57 - 33:00)
walked down the street there was another (32:59 - 33:02)
ray we caught that we walked over to the (33:00 - 33:04)
amphitheater there was a Charizard there (33:02 - 33:06)
were people doing that we caught that we (33:04 - 33:11)
were there from about 6 p.m. to about (33:06 - 33:15)
midnight so six hours and it was just (33:11 - 33:19)
incredible I can't even put into words (33:15 - 33:22)
how much fun I had you people could say (33:19 - 33:25)
well Pokemon go fast was a bust but (33:22 - 33:28)
that's Sunday would have never happened (33:25 - 33:30)
if Pokemon go Fest was successful (33:28 - 33:32)
because one of the things they change on (33:30 - 33:35)
the fly and again props Niantic for (33:32 - 33:37)
doing this is not only did they extend (33:35 - 33:41)
the event out to miles around Chicago (33:37 - 33:44)
they extended it to Monday night so (33:41 - 33:46)
Sunday would have never really (33:44 - 33:48)
without the failure of the event and (33:46 - 33:51)
Sunday was easily one of the best days (33:48 - 33:53)
of Pokemon Goa that I've added that I've (33:51 - 33:55)
ever had playing the game alright and (33:53 - 33:57)
now we fade in every rose has its thorn (33:55 - 34:03)
yes yeah I agree I wish I could have (33:57 - 34:05)
stayed until Monday because I would have (34:03 - 34:06)
gone back down to Chicago with you guys (34:05 - 34:09)
I I I think we said this last week I (34:06 - 34:11)
assume at one point because they the (34:09 - 34:13)
anti kind of threw in the towel around (34:11 - 34:16)
4:30 legendary raids went up at about (34:13 - 34:19)
7:00 7:05 I am sure like halfway through (34:16 - 34:21)
the day they were like we need to get (34:19 - 34:23)
legendary raids working as soon as (34:21 - 34:25)
possible and it's possible that while (34:23 - 34:27)
yeah we are going to miss our 6 o'clock (34:25 - 34:29)
deadline we can probably get it tonight (34:27 - 34:34)
that was the right call we know all (34:29 - 34:35)
these Chicago people are still going to (34:34 - 34:38)
be in town whether they came I'm sure (34:35 - 34:39)
I'm sure some people throughout that (34:38 - 34:41)
night but for the people who didn't (34:39 - 34:43)
which my guess would be most of the (34:41 - 34:45)
people they were still in Chicago and (34:43 - 34:49)
then they they were primed to experience (34:45 - 34:53)
the legendary raids like what like what (34:49 - 34:55)
was talked about here in the blog post (34:53 - 34:56)
and the final thing I want to say on (34:55 - 34:58)
this before we move to our next article (34:56 - 35:01)
is even with all this bad press and (34:58 - 35:04)
Pokemon go fest being a flop at least (35:01 - 35:09)
during baby during the time that it was (35:04 - 35:14)
scheduled Pokemon go the app in iOS made (35:09 - 35:17)
it to number one in the App Store and as (35:14 - 35:19)
of we're recording this it's number two (35:17 - 35:22)
so that's a whole week after the fest (35:19 - 35:24)
has been over like it seems like this is (35:22 - 35:27)
gonna be talked about for a while but it (35:24 - 35:28)
doesn't seem like this is going to put a (35:27 - 35:33)
dent in that core fan base no I agree (35:28 - 35:34)
I've actually been playing Pokemon go a (35:33 - 35:36)
tremendous amount more ever since that (35:34 - 35:38)
Saturday and I've been catching all (35:36 - 35:40)
kinds of Pokemon yeah I agree to some (35:38 - 35:42)
extent I think a lot of the fan base (35:40 - 35:45)
will be angry for a while but I you know (35:42 - 35:47)
you go to the root of their anger it's (35:45 - 35:50)
because they were really excited to have (35:47 - 35:51)
a cool event with the game they like (35:50 - 35:55)
it's like it it probably will still like (35:51 - 35:56)
the game they'll just probably be a (35:55 - 35:58)
little angry about it for a while this (35:56 - 36:00)
probably won't be talked about (35:58 - 36:01)
that much and you know four or five (36:00 - 36:03)
months but the next time the antic does (36:01 - 36:05)
an event I think the only difference (36:03 - 36:10)
there is the people that did go might (36:05 - 36:13)
second-guess buying a ticket but overall (36:10 - 36:16)
I don't think that matters because there (36:13 - 36:18)
were plenty of people that didn't get (36:16 - 36:21)
tickets that would probably buy those (36:18 - 36:23)
tickets as quickly as they can the next (36:21 - 36:25)
time they do this speaking of the next (36:23 - 36:27)
time they do this they're planning on it (36:25 - 36:30)
in Europe but they have delayed some of (36:27 - 36:31)
the European events this is off the (36:30 - 36:34)
verge calm the antique lab through a big (36:31 - 36:36)
event in Chicago last weekend to (36:34 - 36:37)
celebrate the first year of Pokemon go (36:36 - 36:39)
only to run into cellular data (36:37 - 36:41)
congestion and server issues that made (36:39 - 36:43)
the game unplayable for many attendees (36:41 - 36:46)
now the company has announced that it is (36:43 - 36:48)
delaying several of the planned European (36:46 - 36:50)
events to ensure trainers will be able (36:48 - 36:53)
to play the game in a blog post Natick (36:50 - 36:55)
said that two of the events planned for (36:53 - 36:59)
Copenhagen and Prague on August 5th and (36:55 - 37:01)
Stockholm and Amsterdam on August 12th (36:59 - 37:04)
will be delayed until later this fall (37:01 - 37:06)
several of the other planned events for (37:04 - 37:09)
Japan August 14th and France Spain and (37:06 - 37:11)
Germany September 16th are moving (37:09 - 37:14)
forward as scheduled the delay comes (37:11 - 37:16)
after Chicago's Pokemon go Fest got off (37:14 - 37:19)
to a disastrous start last week cellular (37:16 - 37:21)
service was spotty the server issues (37:19 - 37:22)
prevented players from logging into the (37:21 - 37:25)
game when the antic CEO John Hanke took (37:22 - 37:27)
sage for his opening remarks players (37:25 - 37:29)
booed him and the company ultimately (37:27 - 37:31)
ended up offering refunds and $100 worth (37:29 - 37:33)
of pokey coins to players last week (37:31 - 37:36)
nearly two dozen attendees launched a (37:33 - 37:39)
class action lawsuit against Niantic (37:36 - 37:42)
aiming to recoup travel expenses to make (37:39 - 37:45)
up for the delay of its European events (37:42 - 37:47)
the antics said that players in certain (37:45 - 37:49)
European cities should keep their eyes (37:47 - 37:51)
out for Pokemon that are rarely seen in (37:49 - 37:55)
Europe Ghengis case can and promised (37:51 - 37:58)
further updates once the new dates were (37:55 - 38:01)
locked down not terribly big news with (37:58 - 38:03)
the delays I think that's I think that's (38:01 - 38:06)
fine instead of the event ending on (38:03 - 38:08)
September 16th in France Spain and (38:06 - 38:09)
Germany that's when the event is going (38:08 - 38:12)
to be kicking off other events later (38:09 - 38:13)
this fall I think that's (38:12 - 38:15)
let's talk about this two dozen (38:13 - 38:17)
attendees launching a class-action (38:15 - 38:19)
lawsuit I'm sir I'm sure all 24 are from (38:17 - 38:21)
California because they are a lawsuit (38:19 - 38:25)
happy in that state well but just to (38:21 - 38:27)
make it clear that once it becomes if (38:25 - 38:31)
they are granted a class-action lawsuit (38:27 - 38:32)
that means that all attendees of the (38:31 - 38:35)
mango Fest become the class so it's not (38:32 - 38:38)
limited to just those 24 people I'm no (38:35 - 38:40)
longer a class because I bet when I (38:38 - 38:43)
applied for that refund it probably said (38:40 - 38:44)
you can't sue us (38:43 - 38:47)
now you can't you can't give away your (38:44 - 38:49)
legal rights you can't sign away leak (38:47 - 38:52)
certain legal rights so ya know you (38:49 - 38:54)
you're a member of the class you (38:52 - 38:56)
actually I don't want to be a part of (38:54 - 38:57)
the class just like I didn't want to be (38:56 - 39:00)
part of my high school graduate class (38:57 - 39:03)
you you you will be given an the option (39:00 - 39:05)
to remove yourself from the class right (39:03 - 39:07)
like you have probably seen things that (39:05 - 39:09)
come to you in the mail that say like (39:07 - 39:12)
are our records show that you know it (39:09 - 39:13)
like a lot of the times it happens with (39:12 - 39:15)
like vehicles like our records show that (39:13 - 39:18)
you're an owner of a whatever a year (39:15 - 39:22)
Ford or Chevy or whatever whatever and (39:18 - 39:24)
there's a class-action lawsuit so if you (39:22 - 39:28)
want to opt out reply with yada yada so (39:24 - 39:30)
it'll probably be away for if you don't (39:28 - 39:32)
want to be involved there will probably (39:30 - 39:34)
be a specific way for you to opt out of (39:32 - 39:37)
the class do you guys think that a (39:34 - 39:40)
lawsuit is needed for the people who are (39:37 - 39:44)
complaining about travel expenses that's (39:40 - 39:48)
a leading question do you think it's not (39:44 - 39:50)
do you think these complainers are (39:48 - 39:53)
acting in a necessary fashion yeah I (39:50 - 39:55)
think the more more or less the question (39:53 - 39:58)
so Travis not being at the event I think (39:55 - 40:01)
your opinion is very valuable but let's (39:58 - 40:03)
say you drove you you would've drove (40:01 - 40:06)
farther than I would that's for sure I (40:03 - 40:07)
think your drive would have been five (40:06 - 40:12)
hours to Chicago yeah no like two two (40:07 - 40:14)
and a half two and a half okay so let's (40:12 - 40:16)
say let's just say you drove three hours (40:14 - 40:18)
there you didn't want to drive the three (40:16 - 40:20)
hours back so you get a you know you get (40:18 - 40:22)
a hotel room for one night you drive (40:20 - 40:24)
three hours back that's not terribly (40:22 - 40:25)
expensive (40:24 - 40:27)
after the disaster that was the day (40:25 - 40:29)
Yantic is giving you $100 in your game (40:27 - 40:32)
which is I personally was very happy (40:29 - 40:34)
with that and they're refunding your (40:32 - 40:35)
ticket (40:34 - 40:37)
so you're the refunding you $30 well I (40:35 - 40:39)
just do you think that what do you think (40:37 - 40:40)
that was good enough for the people who (40:39 - 40:42)
attended and we're not gonna we're not (40:40 - 40:43)
talking about travel expenses yet we're (40:42 - 40:45)
just talking about those two things I'm (40:43 - 40:47)
having difficulty understanding what (40:45 - 40:48)
question you asked are you asking if (40:47 - 40:53)
you're asking do I think the refund plus (40:48 - 40:58)
the pokey coin credit was suitable from (40:53 - 41:00)
like a like an ethical standpoint like (40:58 - 41:02)
like if you're asking do I think that (41:00 - 41:07)
that was substantial enough to be an (41:02 - 41:10)
example of Niantic doing the right thing (41:07 - 41:14)
if that's your question I think I say (41:10 - 41:18)
yes if you're asking is that enough to (41:14 - 41:23)
make a lawsuit unnecessary my answer (41:18 - 41:25)
would be I don't think those two things (41:23 - 41:29)
are very related at all I mean like I (41:25 - 41:33)
think on the question of a lawsuit I (41:29 - 41:35)
wouldn't know where to start because to (41:33 - 41:40)
me it a lawsuit seems kind of outrageous (41:35 - 41:43)
in this instance like e to sue someone (41:40 - 41:46)
because I paid to go see a thing and (41:43 - 41:49)
then like like I wouldn't go to like the (41:46 - 41:51)
only thing I can think of to compare it (41:49 - 41:52)
that like would be a thing I would go to (41:51 - 41:57)
is like if I went to see a band like (41:52 - 41:59)
play a concert and I thought their set (41:57 - 42:01)
was terrible like I wouldn't sue them (41:59 - 42:04)
like that seems outrageous and to me it (42:01 - 42:06)
I don't really see it as being that much (42:04 - 42:10)
different like it Pokemon go promised an (42:06 - 42:12)
event at Niantic promised an event and (42:10 - 42:16)
it didn't go well but like that's to me (42:12 - 42:18)
that just always that's that's always an (42:16 - 42:20)
option in the back of you know that's (42:18 - 42:22)
always a possibility so I a lawsuit (42:20 - 42:23)
seems strange to me and I don't (42:22 - 42:26)
necessarily think the absence or (42:23 - 42:29)
presence of a refund afterwards really (42:26 - 42:32)
would really effects whether a lawsuit (42:29 - 42:34)
is necessary does that make sense (42:32 - 42:37)
yes no you you answered it exactly how I (42:34 - 42:40)
wanted it you too and I worded that (42:37 - 42:41)
poorly and you still (42:40 - 42:45)
understood it so it just shows the the (42:41 - 42:47)
dedication you have four years of - (42:45 - 42:49)
really good (42:47 - 42:51)
will your thoughts on this lawsuit and (42:49 - 42:55)
if it was if you deem it necessary um so (42:51 - 42:57)
you know I'm not a lawyer but just (42:55 - 42:59)
trying to break it apart in a somewhat (42:57 - 43:03)
legalistic point of view the question is (42:59 - 43:08)
like did not occur until to spend extra (43:03 - 43:11)
amounts of money on airfare and hotel to (43:08 - 43:14)
come to Chicago and you know and then (43:11 - 43:15)
there therefore they are liable for (43:14 - 43:18)
those expenses because if they hadn't (43:15 - 43:21)
have put on their event then people (43:18 - 43:22)
wouldn't have spent the money right and (43:21 - 43:24)
then so they're therefore they have (43:22 - 43:25)
harmed the people that spent the money (43:24 - 43:28)
I just I don't see that as carrying (43:25 - 43:32)
through coherently because you know (43:28 - 43:36)
let's imagine that like some really (43:32 - 43:38)
great band that doesn't play a lot of (43:36 - 43:41)
shows like my favorite band Fall Chen (43:38 - 43:44)
we're gonna do a concert in Central Park (43:41 - 43:46)
in New York right and they're like we're (43:44 - 43:48)
doing one concert it's the first time (43:46 - 43:50)
we've done the concert in a decade and (43:48 - 43:51)
we're not going to do another concert (43:50 - 43:53)
for another decade and this is the one (43:51 - 43:57)
right if people bought plane tickets and (43:53 - 43:59)
hotels in New York City to go see that (43:57 - 44:01)
concert and then fall Cham was like oh (43:59 - 44:04)
we just all got measles so concerts (44:01 - 44:06)
cancelled and we're not rescheduling and (44:04 - 44:08)
you know we'll refund all your tickets (44:06 - 44:10)
there's no lawsuit (44:08 - 44:13)
no one would have a lawsuit saying well (44:10 - 44:16)
we're suing them because we paid all (44:13 - 44:17)
this money so it's really falls into (44:16 - 44:19)
that same category and I'm actually (44:17 - 44:23)
surprised that there are well I want to (44:19 - 44:25)
say that I'm surprised that there are (44:23 - 44:27)
lawyers that took this case thinking (44:25 - 44:30)
that they could actually win but I guess (44:27 - 44:31)
there's lawyers that'll take any case (44:30 - 44:34)
out there wait what you both said I (44:31 - 44:37)
think are good analogies what I was (44:34 - 44:39)
thinking is like my trip I'm going to (44:37 - 44:42)
pax West to talk about Pokemon like I do (44:39 - 44:47)
I just booked Irene and my plane ticket (44:42 - 44:51)
for that and it was $1,100 the hotel I (44:47 - 44:55)
booked was $1,200 so we're at a (44:51 - 44:59)
$2,000 travel expense to go to Seattle (44:55 - 45:03)
for four days and my wallet hurts a lot (44:59 - 45:07)
from that and I'm I am confident that (45:03 - 45:10)
there are there were plenty of people (45:07 - 45:12)
that traveled outside of Chicago that (45:10 - 45:17)
probably paid more than $2,000 to get to (45:12 - 45:20)
Chicago to get a hotel to get ready for (45:17 - 45:24)
Pokemon go fest but who maybe I have the (45:20 - 45:27)
answer the who is the people suing who (45:24 - 45:31)
goes to a new city or just a city for (45:27 - 45:35)
one event and nothing else like when I (45:31 - 45:37)
when I'm going to go to Seattle I'm (45:35 - 45:40)
going to go to the Space Needle I'm (45:37 - 45:43)
going to go to a museum I'm going to (45:40 - 45:44)
walk it down I'm gonna walk around the (45:43 - 45:46)
wharf is that what it's called the wharf (45:44 - 45:50)
I never been to Seattle but rocks this (45:46 - 45:53)
distorter the boat area I'm gonna walk (45:50 - 45:56)
around the boat area I'm gonna do a (45:53 - 45:58)
hundred things because I'm in a new city (45:56 - 46:02)
I'm on a vacation just because the event (45:58 - 46:06)
I went to didn't work a hundred percent (46:02 - 46:10)
it did work some percent and it (46:06 - 46:13)
continued and it worked really well if (46:10 - 46:15)
you walked two blocks away from the (46:13 - 46:19)
event which they extended at what did (46:15 - 46:21)
they extend it will at like 3 p.m. they (46:19 - 46:22)
extended it to get out at that time (46:21 - 46:26)
where they said hey leave the park go (46:22 - 46:28)
catch unknown go catch heracross go get (46:26 - 46:32)
your two kegs one block away just go out (46:28 - 46:34)
and play outside the park it'll work we (46:32 - 46:36)
made it work outside the park and you (46:34 - 46:38)
know what it'll work the rest of the (46:36 - 46:40)
night and I'll work the next day and it (46:38 - 46:42)
will work Monday everything that you can (46:40 - 46:45)
experience here now works just leave the (46:42 - 46:47)
park but going back to my original (46:45 - 46:49)
statement who goes to an event just for (46:47 - 46:52)
one thing like I cannot imagine the (46:49 - 46:53)
people that are suing that flew to (46:52 - 46:56)
Chicago didn't do other stuff in the (46:53 - 46:59)
city there's so much to do in Chicago I (46:56 - 47:01)
don't know that's debatable I mean it is (46:59 - 47:04)
Chicago what are you gonna do you're (47:01 - 47:08)
gonna eat you can irrigate your Chicago (47:04 - 47:11)
you're gonna have a hot dog you see what (47:08 - 47:14)
I'm saying though yeah of course (47:11 - 47:17)
$2,000 is very nice where IAM is very (47:14 - 47:19)
cool I'll I don't agree with the (47:17 - 47:21)
planetarium that was very disappointing (47:19 - 47:27)
now the Chicago the Chicago science and (47:21 - 47:31)
magic those two words don't go together (47:27 - 47:34)
the science of magic industry yeah that (47:31 - 47:37)
museums legit that that is a very good (47:34 - 47:39)
museum I could never imagine going to (47:37 - 47:42)
anis a city for a Pokemon event only (47:39 - 47:44)
doing that Pokemon event and then not (47:42 - 47:45)
doing anything else (47:44 - 47:48)
I mean I'm on the side of the fence (47:45 - 47:50)
where I don't agree with this lawsuit I (47:48 - 47:52)
hope these people Oh honestly it has no (47:50 - 47:55)
legal merit I mean if you just look at (47:52 - 48:00)
any kind of historical precedent there (47:55 - 48:04)
if just legaly large there's no but just (48:00 - 48:05)
look at any large concert that ever got (48:04 - 48:07)
canceled and see if people ever got (48:05 - 48:10)
there travel and hotel paid for and (48:07 - 48:13)
going back to PACs like bungee is going (48:10 - 48:16)
to have their own area at PAX West this (48:13 - 48:18)
year and I'm very excited for that and I (48:16 - 48:20)
booked my tickets before they announced (48:18 - 48:22)
that they were gonna have before they (48:20 - 48:23)
announced that destiny too was going to (48:22 - 48:25)
be there before they announced that they (48:23 - 48:27)
were gonna have their own area if I get (48:25 - 48:29)
there and Bungie goes up well you know (48:27 - 48:31)
that building burned down to a week ago (48:29 - 48:32)
and we don't have a spot to host our (48:31 - 48:35)
event you know what I do instead because (48:32 - 48:37)
most of my most of my time there at PAX (48:35 - 48:39)
will probably be in that Bungie area (48:37 - 48:42)
because I love I love destiny if for (48:39 - 48:43)
some reason that doesn't exist when I (48:42 - 48:45)
get there I'm not gonna say hey I want (48:43 - 48:47)
my two thousand dollars back because I (48:45 - 48:49)
paid to go to pax west and this specific (48:47 - 48:51)
thing at pax west didn't work slash (48:49 - 48:53)
wasn't there slash you know what I do I (48:51 - 48:56)
do other stuff and in the case of (48:53 - 48:58)
Pokemon go yeah it didn't work for most (48:56 - 49:00)
of the day but they made it work in a (48:58 - 49:02)
different situation you just had to (49:00 - 49:04)
listen to what they had to say which was (49:02 - 49:08)
leave our Park and go play elsewhere and (49:04 - 49:09)
it will work we made it work don't worry (49:08 - 49:12)
guys it works and it did work it's it's (49:09 - 49:14)
frustrating what will will will keep (49:12 - 49:17)
covering it as it goes on travel is (49:14 - 49:19)
expensive but no one's no one's forcing (49:17 - 49:21)
you to do it (49:19 - 49:23)
one more bit of news but what we'll do (49:21 - 49:25)
is we'll take a break we got some rumors (49:23 - 49:27)
regarding Ultra Sun and ultramoon (49:25 - 49:29)
probably fake like I said before but (49:27 - 49:31)
we'll talk about it right when we get (49:29 - 49:33)
back from our break which we're taking (49:31 - 50:09)
right now and we are back from our break (49:33 - 50:12)
let's talk about this ultra Sun (50:09 - 50:16)
ultramoon fake rumors wow this is a (50:12 - 50:20)
4chan by the way so you know oh wow it's (50:16 - 50:23)
the latest very finest of information (50:20 - 50:24)
all right (50:23 - 50:27)
so according to this rumor the second (50:24 - 50:28)
trailer for Ultra Sun and ultra moon is (50:27 - 50:32)
supposed to come on August 6 the trailer (50:28 - 50:34)
will start off showing some major (50:32 - 50:37)
character changes Lilly is your rival (50:34 - 50:40)
glady on will take care of nebby and how (50:37 - 50:43)
will be the first trial captain using (50:40 - 50:46)
psychic type of Pokemon already I'm not (50:43 - 50:48)
buying this but psychic type for how (50:46 - 50:51)
that's not just my despit they will then (50:48 - 50:54)
reveal new forms of familiar a lowland (50:51 - 50:57)
Pokemon there will be a mimic you horror (50:54 - 51:00)
form after the disguise activates on (50:57 - 51:02)
certain mimic you their sheets will fall (51:00 - 51:04)
off and show a dark creature with a (51:02 - 51:08)
round head no 8 piercing red eyes and (51:04 - 51:12)
eight of its claws and eight of its (51:08 - 51:14)
claws holding it up along with a (51:12 - 51:17)
drooling matte mouth no and this is (51:14 - 51:19)
wrong right here because we've already (51:17 - 51:20)
seen what mimic you looks like out of (51:19 - 51:24)
its disguise in the Pokemon anime where (51:20 - 51:27)
it's like a floating like an orb all of (51:24 - 51:31)
ya floating or gaseous orb when it (51:27 - 51:33)
undergoes this change it will become (51:31 - 51:35)
ghost / dark (51:33 - 51:38)
and its opponent lardo flinches the turn (51:35 - 51:41)
it is revealed it is much faster and (51:38 - 51:43)
stronger and has higher Special Attack (51:41 - 51:46)
than physical now though its physical (51:43 - 51:48)
attack is still higher than normal mimic (51:46 - 51:51)
you and it's abysmal defend but it will (51:48 - 51:53)
have a Bismil defense and special (51:51 - 51:53)
defense (51:53 - 51:56)
so there's your mimic you change yeah I (51:53 - 51:59)
also agree with Travis even in the anime (51:56 - 52:01)
it shows that it has two eyes underneath (51:59 - 52:02)
its cloak when it's in the water (52:01 - 52:08)
swimming yep yep okay so to bury this (52:02 - 52:11)
room or even more it the trailer will (52:08 - 52:15)
then show aces Azal gangster form it (52:11 - 52:19)
will always be male and it can only it (52:15 - 52:22)
can only become male by leveling up and (52:19 - 52:25)
knowing the move thief I think you've (52:22 - 52:26)
said something wrong there because you (52:25 - 52:29)
said it can only become male you mean it (52:26 - 52:31)
can only only go else can become (52:29 - 52:32)
gangster form yes I'm sorry (52:31 - 52:35)
correct this is the worst thing I've (52:32 - 52:37)
ever heard it's a bill of its ability is (52:35 - 52:41)
prankster and it's poison / dark types (52:37 - 52:43)
slightly higher attack through its (52:41 - 52:46)
attack stat and it's barely uh which is (52:43 - 52:49)
barely unusable higher speed higher a (52:46 - 52:50)
slightly higher defense much lower (52:49 - 52:53)
special attack and special defense it (52:50 - 52:56)
has a mask on like sandal sandal the (52:53 - 53:00)
sandal it sandlot soul and it yep with a (52:56 - 53:03)
cape the cape with no tail it even has (53:00 - 53:05)
more of a slim body next it will show (53:03 - 53:08)
some brand new all Olin forms a lowland (53:05 - 53:11)
qwilfish will be shown with a steel (53:08 - 53:15)
poison tight typing has a new ability (53:11 - 53:17)
iron gar guard which is immune to all (53:15 - 53:20)
statuses including minor statuses like (53:17 - 53:23)
confusion and infatuation it almost (53:20 - 53:25)
always goes last even with a priority (53:23 - 53:27)
move and the opponent using a - priority (53:25 - 53:29)
move that doesn't make any sense and (53:27 - 53:33)
destroys the writer even more it is more (53:29 - 53:35)
like that unless the a theoretical new (53:33 - 53:40)
ability also included that which is it's (53:35 - 53:42)
more metallic looking darker green parts (53:40 - 53:45)
are silver having longer shaped quills (53:42 - 53:48)
also has a ball and chain at (53:45 - 53:50)
matched a lowland snubbull and grand (53:48 - 53:53)
bull ground for snubbull ground fighting (53:50 - 53:57)
for grand bull ability is imitate on (53:53 - 54:00)
stub snubbull knock back for Grandville (53:57 - 54:03)
contact moves have a 20% chance to (54:00 - 54:06)
switch the Pokemon out their color (54:03 - 54:09)
scheme is out of an actual bulldog more (54:06 - 54:12)
muscular both stand on all four more (54:09 - 54:17)
coming below a lowland slugma is ice (54:12 - 54:21)
ability ability is freezing pressure (54:17 - 54:24)
makes water type moves used on it sent (54:21 - 54:27)
back at 1.5 power of an ice type move (54:24 - 54:30)
however fire type moves even the ones (54:27 - 54:32)
that don't do it have a hundred percent (54:30 - 54:34)
chance of burn when you use on slugma (54:32 - 54:38)
woo these abilities are real complicated (54:34 - 54:40)
for a rumor yeah and the fact that all (54:38 - 54:42)
of them almost and all of them are like (54:40 - 54:43)
unique abilities with the exception of (54:42 - 54:45)
prankster which is a huge like fan (54:43 - 54:48)
favorite ability like hmm it's almost (54:45 - 54:51)
like this is just uh these are just some (54:48 - 54:54)
ones you know fantasies about what a (54:51 - 54:57)
cool Pokemon would be a final thing (54:54 - 54:59)
shown in the trailer is a twist is what (54:57 - 55:02)
the twisting cling was shown in trailer (54:59 - 55:06)
one is it's a Z it's called a Z ability (55:02 - 55:09)
one Pokemon per battle has its ability (55:06 - 55:13)
buff overgrown blaze or and torment for (55:09 - 55:15)
example I'll do the same thing with full (55:13 - 55:19)
HP their stats besides HP are basically (55:15 - 55:21)
half of what they're supposed to do but (55:19 - 55:23)
the more damage the Pokemon takes the (55:21 - 55:27)
more powerful the move gets at 1/8 HP or (55:23 - 55:29)
lower their base stats are doubled only (55:27 - 55:31)
Pokemon with exclusive Z crystals can (55:29 - 55:35)
have AZ ability and acts as a Z move in (55:31 - 55:38)
single battle its Z move or Z ability (55:35 - 55:42)
one or another first comment is sounds (55:38 - 55:43)
plausible (55:42 - 55:46)
[Laughter] (55:43 - 55:48)
does it the problem I have with this (55:46 - 55:51)
rumor is how complicated the abilities (55:48 - 55:54)
are like the whole yeah hey you're (55:51 - 55:57)
you're if you're a lowland Slugma you're (55:54 - 55:59)
getting burned by any fire type move (55:57 - 56:02)
even if the fire type move doesn't burn (55:59 - 56:05)
you what ability has ever been that (56:02 - 56:08)
complicated arguably the most (56:05 - 56:11)
complicated ability or maybe it just (56:08 - 56:12)
seems the most complicated because it's (56:11 - 56:15)
new and complicated but arguably the (56:12 - 56:18)
most complicated ability is water bubble (56:15 - 56:24)
which is the ability that arachnid I (56:18 - 56:28)
recommend yeah yeah has because it has (56:24 - 56:32)
like multiple effects so first it cuts (56:28 - 56:34)
the damage from fire type moves in half (56:32 - 56:39)
and it but it also doubles the power of (56:34 - 56:43)
water type moves you use but it also (56:39 - 56:48)
also prevents you from being burned and (56:43 - 56:50)
like there's all these stipulate and (56:48 - 56:54)
like that is such an exception to the (56:50 - 56:58)
rule and like every and and stands out (56:54 - 57:00)
for how strange it is and how many (56:58 - 57:02)
effects it has like as I was listening (57:00 - 57:04)
them I had already forgotten some of the (57:02 - 57:06)
earlier effects that I had already said (57:04 - 57:09)
and pretty much all of the abilities (57:06 - 57:11)
that were listed there are like on that (57:09 - 57:15)
level of complication and like water (57:11 - 57:16)
bubble already stands out so much of (57:15 - 57:19)
being strange and overly complicated I (57:16 - 57:22)
really doubt that they're like let's (57:19 - 57:26)
just have a bunch of those also soul as (57:22 - 57:30)
a mean dude now even though even going (57:26 - 57:32)
back to the first sentence lily is your (57:30 - 57:34)
rival glady and will take care of Nabi I (57:32 - 57:37)
have zero zero clue how that works on a (57:34 - 57:40)
story in a story sentence and how was (57:37 - 57:43)
the first trial captain I think we were (57:40 - 57:44)
all in agreement that this was more like (57:43 - 57:46)
a platinum or an emerald than a black (57:44 - 57:48)
and white - correct and what they're (57:46 - 57:50)
laying out seems more like a black and (57:48 - 57:53)
white - of yeah the whole mimic you (57:50 - 57:55)
thing I don't think it's plausible at (57:53 - 57:58)
all it's not like the animes (57:55 - 58:02)
things and it's got blood and it's got (57:58 - 58:06)
death and it's really not all I could (58:02 - 58:11)
see mimic you having its own form I (58:06 - 58:12)
could totally see that (58:11 - 58:16)
I also understand the basic concept of (58:12 - 58:19)
if you're going to have a Pokemon hiding (58:16 - 58:22)
under a disguise you probably never (58:19 - 58:24)
actually show what's under there because (58:22 - 58:28)
that's just like a trope that you use to (58:24 - 58:31)
get people interested in it this that (58:28 - 58:34)
make sense like why it's like in Harry (58:31 - 58:37)
Potter you never see the true form of (58:34 - 58:39)
the bog art or whatever that you never (58:37 - 58:42)
see that and that's the point and I feel (58:39 - 58:44)
like that's the point of mimic you you (58:42 - 58:46)
don't know what's under to the disguise (58:44 - 58:50)
and once you know it defined of deflates (58:46 - 58:54)
the importance of that Pokemon once you (58:50 - 58:58)
know yep I I could see a male like a (58:54 - 59:01)
gangster form obviously isn't what it (58:58 - 59:02)
would actually be called I could totally (59:01 - 59:05)
see a male selasa but I think that takes (59:02 - 59:08)
away the specialness of finding a female (59:05 - 59:11)
so Zazzle sandal it sandal sandal sandal (59:08 - 59:18)
the same a lot soul and it yeah yeah the (59:11 - 59:21)
quill like via lowland qwilfish sounds (59:18 - 59:23)
plausible except for the ridiculous (59:21 - 59:26)
ability that yeah like if your ability (59:23 - 59:28)
of quote-unquote Iron Guard which I (59:26 - 59:30)
think they said that it's not an Iron (59:28 - 59:32)
Guard sounds like an ability that exists (59:30 - 59:34)
but apparently they're saying it's a new (59:32 - 59:35)
ability but that's that's fine for an (59:34 - 59:38)
ability to go hey we're you're immune to (59:35 - 59:41)
every single status condition including (59:38 - 59:43)
confusion and infatuation which okay (59:41 - 59:47)
that's fine cool but also if you use (59:43 - 59:52)
quick attack and they use protect wait (59:47 - 59:53)
now protect his highest priority what's (59:52 - 59:56)
a move that example yeah or as a counter (59:53 - 59:58)
counter goes second right count-o toner (59:56 - 60:00)
is a good example but well may be a bad (59:58 - 60:04)
example but pursuit pursuit yeah pursued (60:00 - 60:07)
always go second doesn't it we're very (60:04 - 60:10)
we're Pokemon experts here anyways (60:07 - 60:12)
qwilfish has Aquajet which I'm pretty (60:10 - 60:15)
sure a normal cool fish can learn which (60:12 - 60:18)
is prior to +1 well fish uses Aquajet (60:15 - 60:22)
and they use just a base zero move and (60:18 - 60:25)
they're slower so let's say there what's (60:22 - 60:28)
this what's a slow pokemon snorlax I (60:25 - 60:30)
think qwilfish is faster than Snorlax to (60:28 - 60:34)
tell me that the ability also makes them (60:30 - 60:36)
go last using a plus one priority that (60:34 - 60:38)
that doesn't make any sense (60:36 - 60:42)
- priority so the lowest priority move (60:38 - 60:45)
in generation seven at least in this (60:42 - 60:46)
chart that I'm looking at right here is (60:45 - 60:49)
trick room okay (60:46 - 60:52)
trick room would go before a Aquajet (60:49 - 60:55)
yeah that doesn't seem right or (60:52 - 60:58)
something I don't know hmm and then the (60:55 - 60:59)
real question is how does any of that (60:58 - 61:02)
work once trick room goes up I don't (60:59 - 61:06)
want to think about it yeah and I would (61:02 - 61:08)
even I would even go to the extent of (61:06 - 61:12)
saying none of this sounds that great (61:08 - 61:16)
like a low one qwilfish cool I could I (61:12 - 61:18)
could buy into that cuz qwilfish is a (61:16 - 61:21)
pretty okay Pokemon everything listed (61:18 - 61:26)
just sounds a little too edgy you know (61:21 - 61:28)
okay there aren't there aren't any (61:26 - 61:30)
little cute pokémon in this description (61:28 - 61:34)
true where's the toga Don Mario yeah I (61:30 - 61:36)
don't know I also like if they're (61:34 - 61:38)
showing all Lolan forms for Generation - (61:36 - 61:42)
I don't think slugma and qwilfish are (61:38 - 61:46)
your staple Pokemon show feel like you (61:42 - 61:49)
have other who remembers gentie Pokemon (61:46 - 61:53)

evolution so that's not as cool as it (61:57 - 62:03)
mammoth I like Mamoswine a lot Mamoswine (62:00 - 62:06)
is fine but it's too big for pokey hugs (62:03 - 62:08)
I already went over this okay I (62:06 - 62:10)
understand (62:08 - 62:13)
let's do some evals (62:10 - 62:15)
first email we have if you have any (62:13 - 62:17)
questions comments or concerns you can (62:15 - 62:23)
send us emails over at SB j at pkmn cast (62:17 - 62:27)
comm or go over to pokemon podcast comm (62:23 - 62:30)
hit that contact button first email here (62:27 - 62:33)
is from Stefan says that in the first (62:30 - 62:35)
sentence hi my name is Stefan pronounced (62:33 - 62:39)
Stef Finn I was thinking about this (62:35 - 62:41)
after listening to broke man no fast (62:39 - 62:44)
podcast again sorry to hear that will (62:41 - 62:46)
didn't get any golden birthday booty (62:44 - 62:49)
just one question how did you all meet (62:46 - 62:50)
I've been listening to the podcast for (62:49 - 62:52)
over a year now I love it I haven't (62:50 - 62:54)
thought about it into listening to you (62:52 - 62:56)
all in the same room with each other (62:54 - 63:00)
Stefan I definitely sent in well a is it (62:56 - 63:04)
I was a big fan of the show for I (63:00 - 63:06)
listened in the show's early days and I (63:04 - 63:08)
was a huge fan of it to the extent where (63:06 - 63:10)
when I was in high school I would be (63:08 - 63:15)
sitting in class that I always it was (63:10 - 63:17)
there wasn't enough work to do in that (63:15 - 63:19)
class and it was a computer class (63:17 - 63:21)
so I ended up just sitting on the (63:19 - 63:23)
Pokemon podcast on the it's super (63:21 - 63:25)
effective website and refreshing waiting (63:23 - 63:27)
for new articles to appear because (63:25 - 63:29)
that's when there was a lot of written (63:27 - 63:31)
content on the website and I'll just sit (63:29 - 63:33)
there like come on I need I need some (63:31 - 63:35)
content right now I'm sitting you're (63:33 - 63:38)
bored in class and so and so in that (63:35 - 63:40)
those days I did write I wrote in (63:38 - 63:43)
occasionally as you are listener Stefan (63:40 - 63:49)
and then later around episode like well (63:43 - 63:52)
so episode 31 was my first but so a (63:49 - 63:54)
little bit before that I think you (63:52 - 63:56)
tweeted out something along the lines of (63:54 - 63:59)
would anyone be interested in being on (63:56 - 64:02)
the show or something and I already had (63:59 - 64:05)
some experience podcasting because a (64:02 - 64:07)
predecessor of one of my shows now a (64:05 - 64:09)
predecessor to the arbitrary archive (64:07 - 64:12)
that show I was already doing at that (64:09 - 64:13)
point when I was still in high school (64:12 - 64:15)
with my brother so I already had a (64:13 - 64:19)
microphone I knew how it went so I said (64:15 - 64:21)
hey I know things about Pokemon and I (64:19 - 64:23)
really liked your show so I can do it (64:21 - 64:26)
and then he said okay and (64:23 - 64:28)
me and Kenny hopped in a Skype call and (64:26 - 64:32)
we recorded episode 31 revamp that is (64:28 - 64:34)
accurate will I don't remember the (64:32 - 64:36)
initial conversation but I remember I (64:34 - 64:39)
was in a I was living in a house at the (64:36 - 64:40)
time I was sharing a house with two (64:39 - 64:43)
other people I already met Irene at this (64:40 - 64:47)
point and we talked a little bit I'm (64:43 - 64:49)
pretty sure it was over email and then I (64:47 - 64:51)
found out you worked at Georgetown and (64:49 - 64:53)
you wanted to do content for the site (64:51 - 64:58)
and you had a degree in African Studies (64:53 - 65:01)
if I recall well I mean that's part of (64:58 - 65:03)
it sure I remember all that at once and (65:01 - 65:05)
then being very excited and going to (65:03 - 65:07)
work about just like meeting you but I (65:05 - 65:09)
don't remember why you initially emailed (65:07 - 65:12)
in or was like hey I'm reaching up to (65:09 - 65:14)
you oh I remember our very first very (65:12 - 65:16)
very first interaction of all (65:14 - 65:19)
interactions you tweeted something from (65:16 - 65:21)
the show account about the number of (65:19 - 65:25)
hours you had put into Pokemon black and (65:21 - 65:27)
white and I responded and said don't (65:25 - 65:31)
worry it caps out after 999 because I (65:27 - 65:32)
had already hit that number (65:31 - 65:37)
oh man that it stops counting once you (65:32 - 65:40)
get to 9-under didn't I did not now I (65:37 - 65:43)
put a lot of time in the black/white no (65:40 - 65:48)
I think I can't remember why but Dave (65:43 - 65:52)
Thomas was like not doing Pokemon of the (65:48 - 65:54)
week articles anymore so and you were (65:52 - 65:56)
like revamping the site and you were (65:54 - 65:58)
like oh I need people to provide content (65:56 - 66:00)
for the site and I was like well I got (65:58 - 66:02)
nothing better to do with my life let me (66:00 - 66:03)
see if I can write articles and then (66:02 - 66:04)
you're like well give me a sample (66:03 - 66:06)
article and then I did and then you're (66:04 - 66:08)
like well that sounds good you can write (66:06 - 66:09)
Pokemon of the week and then I started (66:08 - 66:12)
writing Pokemon of the week February (66:09 - 66:17)
14th 2012 I think yeah it was really (66:12 - 66:21)
2012 what oh yeah that what that's right (66:17 - 66:23)
because yeah that sounds right my first (66:21 - 66:28)
article was Totodile not terribly (66:23 - 66:31)
exciting stories but stories nonetheless (66:28 - 66:34)
this message is from Scott (66:31 - 66:37)
hey SBJ and squad no favorites here you (66:34 - 66:40)
are all great this is Scott from Phoenix (66:37 - 66:42)
Arizona at Scott and slack I've been (66:40 - 66:44)
listening since the black and white days (66:42 - 66:47)
I haven't sent in an email to the show (66:44 - 66:49)
for awhile and I have a question that's (66:47 - 66:50)
been on my mind since Sun and Moon (66:49 - 66:52)
launched are you planning on doing Ana (66:50 - 66:54)
Lola top 10 ranking like you did for (66:52 - 66:57)
Kalos I love the Kalos top 10 and I (66:54 - 66:59)
would really enjoy getting your opinions (66:57 - 67:01)
on the top oh Lola Pokemon now with the (66:59 - 67:02)
games now that the games have been out (67:01 - 67:05)
for a while I was also a big fan of the (67:02 - 67:07)
Kickstarter episode and I thought it (67:05 - 67:08)
would be even better if you could all (67:07 - 67:11)
record the list creation just a thought (67:08 - 67:14)
thanks for all you do Scott so this is (67:11 - 67:16)
just a person who likes ranking things (67:14 - 67:20)
hmm love the rank I remember talking (67:16 - 67:24)
about did we we talked about the Kayla (67:20 - 67:26)
or not the Kayla see a lowland Pokemon (67:24 - 67:28)
when we did the Kickstarter episode and (67:26 - 67:32)
the consensus at that time was you all (67:28 - 67:35)
really wanted mimic you know I think the (67:32 - 67:38)
consensus was that like not all of them (67:35 - 67:39)
had even been announced at that point (67:38 - 67:43)
right yeah was it (67:39 - 67:46)
or the games came out I remember a lot (67:43 - 67:48)
of you wanted to put mimic you on the (67:46 - 67:51)
list and I finally said hey we're not (67:48 - 67:53)
going yeah with this remember it being (67:51 - 67:55)
that way I don't remember being that way (67:53 - 67:57)
at all I think it was just like mimic (67:55 - 67:58)
you had just been announced and me and (67:57 - 68:00)
Mike I thought mimic you was funny and (67:58 - 68:04)
like would jokingly said if a lowland (68:00 - 68:05)
Pokemon were allowed it would just be (68:04 - 68:08)
all mimic you all town okay as a joke (68:05 - 68:10)
because I don't think all of the yellow (68:08 - 68:12)
and Pokemon had even that announced yet (68:10 - 68:14)
I think you're right but we was like no (68:12 - 68:16)
let's let's not worry about a Lola and (68:14 - 68:19)
we did the list as it was and now I (68:16 - 68:21)
think we're so close to ultra sentient (68:19 - 68:24)
ultramoon it would be a shame if we did (68:21 - 68:25)
it now and then all of a sudden they (68:24 - 68:30)
show you know a Lowen Ursaring and we (68:25 - 68:31)
would have to adjust the list (68:30 - 68:33)
accordingly so I think it's something we (68:31 - 68:37)
would do but probably after ultra Sun (68:33 - 68:39)
and ultra moon and I think that's okay (68:37 - 68:40)
because it's still like the same (68:39 - 68:44)
generation I think that works give me (68:40 - 68:46)
and give me a quick quick take named (68:44 - 68:48)
three Pokemon you that you'd consider (68:46 - 68:51)
for that list robot and I'll probably (68:48 - 68:54)
have the same exact ones ya rabbim be (68:51 - 68:57)
right out of thank you mmm it's hard to (68:54 - 69:01)
narrow down a third like dual Lolan (68:57 - 69:03)
forms count yeah that's the other (69:01 - 69:06)
question if they do then probably I (69:03 - 69:10)
think maybe like a lowland exeggutor I'm (69:06 - 69:13)
a huge Rabanne B fan that just by very (69:10 - 69:17)
good it's it's just a very special (69:13 - 69:22)
little guy that that you got to have it (69:17 - 69:28)
also can like kill dragons so I mean (69:22 - 69:30)
they make use an easy call because that (69:28 - 69:32)
is such a really cool although I'm using (69:30 - 69:35)
mimic you in my Pokemon Sun playthrough (69:32 - 69:37)
right now so basically I hatched it from (69:35 - 69:40)
an egg and it's not that strong in the (69:37 - 69:46)
lower levels it's really useful it it is (69:40 - 69:47)
useful to have in a single-player (69:46 - 69:50)
playthrough though because once you have (69:47 - 69:53)
leveled it up to an extent where your (69:50 - 69:55)
higher level than all of the wild (69:53 - 69:56)
Pokemon (69:55 - 69:58)
it's really nice to be able to have a (69:56 - 70:02)
Pokemon that can take a hit and no HP is (69:58 - 70:03)
lost because you just always yell with (70:02 - 70:06)
it in the front and it's disguised as (70:03 - 70:07)
dead but you up but you can pretty much (70:06 - 70:09)
guarantee two hits and then you'd like (70:07 - 70:11)
never lose HP and you don't lose that (70:09 - 70:14)
sort of war of attrition that is walking (70:11 - 70:17)
through a route to the next pokey Center (70:14 - 70:20)
yeah the really hard thing is though it (70:17 - 70:22)
doesn't learn play rough until level 46 (70:20 - 70:26)
oof so that's the long wait before you (70:22 - 70:29)
get that really strong fairy-type move (70:26 - 70:34)
well though it's cute um my third mm I (70:29 - 70:38)
don't know but it's a tough call I mean (70:34 - 70:41)
there's so many that I like I love all (70:38 - 70:45)
the Pokemon I mean Iraq wa need is the (70:41 - 70:48)
one that was my like workhorse for most (70:45 - 70:52)
of my Pokemon moon playthrough so I have (70:48 - 70:54)
to go with that I would probably go with (70:52 - 70:59)
two cannon Lytton and a low infernal cat (70:54 - 71:04)
Inferno cat those are terrible picks oh (70:59 - 71:05)
man (71:04 - 71:08)
- Kaelyn city garbage Pokemon what is (71:05 - 71:11)
the third one what did you see oh oh oh (71:08 - 71:14)
and muck I like a little and muck a lot (71:11 - 71:16)
it's it's it's my little pride flag (71:14 - 71:21)
Pokemon it on it will do will do one (71:16 - 71:24)
more email for this episode this one is (71:21 - 71:26)
from AC Boston (71:24 - 71:29)
hey everyone big shout out to mcbird (71:26 - 71:31)
Burgess dye say that right Burgas (71:29 - 71:34)
Burgess urges Burgess for all the (71:31 - 71:36)
awesome music that he's been making for (71:34 - 71:38)
the show the bumps are now one of the (71:36 - 71:40)
elements I look forward to most each (71:38 - 71:44)
week on new is see an episode 273 Steve (71:40 - 71:48)
tackled the issue of how although we've (71:44 - 71:49)
gotten mega evolutions in regional (71:48 - 71:51)
variants we haven't seen many (71:49 - 71:54)
straightforward evolutions of classic so (71:51 - 71:57)
now Jen 1 - Jen for I guess Pokemon that (71:54 - 72:00)
we did with Jen 2 and Jen for a long (71:57 - 72:03)
time ago that got me thinking what if (72:00 - 72:05)
assuming that Pokemon continues to (72:03 - 72:07)
introduce regional variants and (72:05 - 72:09)
pre-existing species they introduced (72:07 - 72:11)
new regional form of an old Pokemon and (72:09 - 72:14)
give it that regional form its own (72:11 - 72:17)
unique evolution although sand the sands (72:14 - 72:20)
slot / is the end of the line when it (72:17 - 72:22)
comes to Sandshrew traditional evolution (72:20 - 72:25)
what if a lowland sand / could evolve (72:22 - 72:27)
further into a stage - Pokemon we've (72:25 - 72:28)
never seen before (72:27 - 72:32)
because can Tony insane / cannot evolve (72:28 - 72:35)
any further but a lowland sand / can (72:32 - 72:38)
this could give some stage 1 pokémon (72:35 - 72:40)
without mega evolutions an extra buff (72:38 - 72:42)
such as dong Don fan (72:40 - 72:46)
Ursaring or mark cargo pants it's a (72:42 - 72:48)
weird thought and I don't know how I (72:46 - 72:50)
feel about it so I figured I'd run it by (72:48 - 72:51)
you keep up the good work (72:50 - 72:54)
AC where do I put this garbage in my (72:51 - 72:57)
pokedex yeah what what what pokedex (72:54 - 72:59)
number does it get you you the math does (72:57 - 73:02)
not work yeah the Pokedex number would (72:59 - 73:05)
be a little weird although I mean it's (73:02 - 73:07)
already toured with haunch crow and like (73:05 - 73:10)
politoed and stuff fine the math does (73:07 - 73:13)
work I mean I like the idea thick they (73:10 - 73:16)
can do whatever they want and it is it (73:13 - 73:18)
is a nice idea where they can sort of (73:16 - 73:21)
just expand on our currently enjoyed (73:18 - 73:22)
pokemons (73:21 - 73:24)
well except that the problem is that (73:22 - 73:26)
they haven't revealed them yet right and (73:24 - 73:28)
I don't want them one of the biggest (73:26 - 73:30)
mice biggest criticisms of black - white (73:28 - 73:33)
- was it's like oh it's five years later (73:30 - 73:37)
and wow we've had this huge surge of (73:33 - 73:40)
foreign pokemons all over you Nova now (73:37 - 73:42)
that we didn't have five years ago and (73:40 - 73:45)
I'm like oh this is the lifecycle of (73:42 - 73:46)
Pokemon really five years that they (73:45 - 73:50)
could have this many up here from out of (73:46 - 73:52)
nowhere a cargo plane just flew overhead (73:50 - 73:56)
and open attached and you know dropped a (73:52 - 73:59)
bunch of Chimchar s and stuff that's not (73:56 - 74:03)
warrant any chairs laid on 0.5 yeah the (73:59 - 74:07)
story the cargo gained but you know yeah (74:03 - 74:09)
that's so that's my what a my concerns (74:07 - 74:10)
with Ultra Sun and ultra moon and (74:09 - 74:14)
introducing new Pokemon that just they (74:10 - 74:15)
weren't there but they just happen to be (74:14 - 74:19)
there now that that would I would not (74:15 - 74:21)
enjoy that I would that would take away (74:19 - 74:22)
from the games (74:21 - 74:25)
for me so but even if they didn't do (74:22 - 74:27)
this an ultra son an ultra moon but they (74:25 - 74:29)
did in a future game it would still be (74:27 - 74:31)
interesting (74:29 - 74:34)
I suppose I my guess is they wouldn't do (74:31 - 74:38)
it just because I doubt they would want (74:34 - 74:44)
to introduce two versions of the same (74:38 - 74:46)
evolutionary line where one is strictly (74:44 - 74:49)
better than the other and I don't think (74:46 - 74:51)
they would be willing to put in the (74:49 - 74:54)
design effort to craft an evolution in (74:51 - 74:58)
the theoretical version of the (74:54 - 75:01)
evolutionary line that has an additional (74:58 - 75:03)
stage I doubt they would want to put in (75:01 - 75:05)
all the design effort to make it not (75:03 - 75:07)
seem strictly better than the (75:05 - 75:09)
evolutionary line that doesn't get the (75:07 - 75:11)
evolution is what I'm saying does that (75:09 - 75:14)
make sense yeah so just for your (75:11 - 75:15)
clarification purposes maybe this is a (75:14 - 75:18)
dumb question and I am pretty confident (75:15 - 75:20)
I know the answer but I'm just gonna ask (75:18 - 75:24)
it anyways you can only get a lowland (75:20 - 75:29)
Rattata in sun and moon right correct (75:24 - 75:33)
and what if I take a regular read attack (75:29 - 75:39)
from X&Y move it to Pokemon bank and (75:33 - 75:43)
then move it to Sun and Moon it stays as (75:39 - 75:46)
a regular read attack correct if you (75:43 - 75:48)
breed it however that was my next (75:46 - 75:49)
question (75:48 - 75:53)
it will be born as in a lowland form (75:49 - 75:59)
okay but what if I breed - Rattata from (75:53 - 76:04)
X&Y is it then a lowland because you're (75:59 - 76:07)
in Sun and Moon yes to my knowledge (76:04 - 76:09)
I can look it up and confirm but that (76:07 - 76:10)
was my understanding (76:09 - 76:14)
so a regular muck and a ditto (76:10 - 76:17)
e'en Sun and Moon will produce an Aloha (76:14 - 76:21)
and Grimer even though it shouldn't I (76:17 - 76:24)
don't know I feel like it shouldn't if I (76:21 - 76:27)
mean influence of the islands so okay (76:24 - 76:29)
but it's but mom amok has no rainbow (76:27 - 76:33)
going through her okay genetics has no (76:29 - 76:36)
application to the Pokemon world even if (76:33 - 76:38)
they did try to imply that through (76:36 - 76:43)
Pokemon X&Y eggs appear by magic na (76:38 - 76:46)
psychology well not with that attitude (76:43 - 76:48)
no comment (76:46 - 76:51)
I guess my other question and we (76:48 - 76:54)
probably don't know the answer is I can (76:51 - 76:57)
have a lowland rata and regular rata sit (76:54 - 77:00)
and Pokemon bank together and the (76:57 - 77:04)
assumption would be whenever a new game (77:00 - 77:07)
comes out that isn't a low and related (77:04 - 77:10)
so let's say you know gen 8 is on (77:07 - 77:14)
Australia and I move a low and riot at (77:10 - 77:16)
and a lowland a lowland rats head (77:14 - 77:19)
regular riot at into a daycare I would (77:16 - 77:22)
assume that maybe if the mom is a (77:19 - 77:22)
lowland (77:22 - 77:24)
it produced well that doesn't make sense (77:22 - 77:26)
because going with your original (77:24 - 77:29)
statement if it's the region that is (77:26 - 77:31)
generating these riots hats it'll be (77:29 - 77:36)
dark then on a different Island they (77:31 - 77:38)
would just become normal again even (77:36 - 77:41)
though one might be a lowland and one (77:38 - 77:42)
wouldn't be alone (77:41 - 77:45)
one of the appearance has to hold a (77:42 - 77:48)
lowland in sense and then it has an a (77:45 - 77:51)
lowland child that's not that's not a (77:48 - 77:55)
real thing now it's not I was so in that (77:51 - 77:57)
as you're asking that question I was (77:55 - 77:59)
looking up to see if my previous answer (77:57 - 78:02)
was correct and it was to a point to a (77:59 - 78:04)
back pad a little but the question was (78:02 - 78:10)
due to Kanto form Pokemon so like - (78:04 - 78:15)
Kanto form Rattata if they breed do they (78:10 - 78:18)
form a lowland or Kanto form Ratatat if (78:15 - 78:22)
bred in sun and moon and the answer is (78:18 - 78:25)
that they will for manilow 'ln Ratatat (78:22 - 78:28)
unless they are given a verse tones to (78:25 - 78:31)
hold at which point they will breed a (78:28 - 78:37)
Kanto Revathy okay they both have to (78:31 - 78:39)
have ever stones the only example I (78:37 - 78:41)
could find on the internet was was with (78:39 - 78:44)
a Ditto so I'm not sure it might be just (78:41 - 78:45)
the mother or just the father I would (78:44 - 78:48)
imagine just the mother interesting (78:45 - 78:50)
that's good to know it's a good question (78:48 - 78:54)
- from AC well I think that'll wrap up (78:50 - 78:57)
emails if you have any emails and if if (78:54 - 78:58)
you set them first off if you sent an (78:57 - 79:00)
email I haven't gotten to it don't worry (78:58 - 79:04)
I there flagged to read if it's been (79:00 - 79:06)
it's been more like a month and I (79:04 - 79:08)
haven't gotten to it maybe Ari email but (79:06 - 79:10)
anyways if you want to send in any (79:08 - 79:15)
emails SP j at pkmn cast calm or pokemon (79:10 - 79:17)
podcast calm and hit that contact button (79:15 - 79:20)
and send us your emails we love reading (79:17 - 79:26)
them let's do our pokemon of the week so (79:20 - 79:29)
we switched it up the week before (79:26 - 79:33)
because Travis is here what it's going (79:29 - 79:36)
to be is will is going to start off (79:33 - 79:40)
Pokemon of the week with the violet (79:36 - 79:43)
what's it called biology biology yep and (79:40 - 79:47)
then Travis will give us a move set for (79:43 - 79:50)
that and then I'll do a quick Pokemon go (79:47 - 79:52)
move set and then we'll do trivia and (79:50 - 79:53)
then we'll wrap it up so that's the (79:52 - 79:55)
first time we're trying it with Travis (79:53 - 79:56)
because (79:55 - 79:58)
they were not here when we originally (79:56 - 80:00)
switched this UPS right take it away (79:58 - 80:02)
will did we say our Pokemon the week was (80:00 - 80:05)
Kabutops did I say that no no and you're (80:02 - 80:06)
supposed to say it at the beginning of (80:05 - 80:08)
the program oh yeah where's little kid (80:06 - 80:10)
went to sleep and net we'll never know (80:08 - 80:13)
hopefully the week was hopefully he read (80:10 - 80:18)
the notes with a body closely resembling (80:13 - 80:21)
a living skeleton Kabutops has a (80:18 - 80:23)
Halfmoon disc shaped head (80:21 - 80:26)
with two small forward-facing eyes its (80:23 - 80:28)
body has a light gray chest plate with a (80:26 - 80:30)
brown shell resembling a visible (80:28 - 80:32)
backbone containing three ribs per (80:30 - 80:35)
turning on each side and a thick pointed (80:32 - 80:38)
tail it does not have hands but large (80:35 - 80:41)
sharp gray size its legs are brown and (80:38 - 80:44)
thin leading into small feet with two (80:41 - 80:47)
large grey claws Kabutops can tuck in (80:44 - 80:49)
its shell to help it swim extremely fast (80:47 - 80:51)
in its ocean home where it can catch (80:49 - 80:55)
prey it uses its sharp size to cut (80:51 - 80:57)
enemies and drink their internal fluids (80:55 - 80:59)
before it went extinct it was in the (80:57 - 81:01)
process of evolving into a land dweller (80:59 - 81:03)
in order to catch prey that had already (81:01 - 81:05)
evolved into land dwelling species as (81:03 - 81:08)
seen in the anime Kabutops greatly (81:05 - 81:10)
prefer to live in seclusion and will (81:08 - 81:13)
become very hostile when provoked well (81:10 - 81:15)
we get to see some of that hostility on (81:13 - 81:19)
the Pokemon battlefield and for that the (81:15 - 81:23)
submission from Kevin a frequent Pokemon (81:19 - 81:25)
week contributor in the Pokemon of the (81:23 - 81:28)
week slack channel because Kabutops has (81:25 - 81:31)
access to a very strong ability in Swift (81:28 - 81:35)
swim this is going to be a move set (81:31 - 81:37)
designed to be paired with something (81:35 - 81:40)
that said that sets up rain most likely (81:37 - 81:42)
pelipper which I believe is a book about (81:40 - 81:44)
of the week maybe a month ago so (81:42 - 81:46)
pelipper will set up rain with the (81:44 - 81:49)
ability drizzle and then Kabutops will (81:46 - 81:51)
be paired with it because the Swift swim (81:49 - 81:53)
ability I mentioned earlier doubles the (81:51 - 81:55)
speed of a given Pokemon when under the (81:53 - 81:59)
effects of rain which is very handy to (81:55 - 82:02)
be able to go first more often so it's (81:59 - 82:03)
going to be Kabutops with a life orb to (82:02 - 82:05)
maximize the amount of damage output (82:03 - 82:08)
we're having given that Swift swim gears (82:05 - 82:10)
you towards a very often so (82:08 - 82:13)
set with adamant nature to maximize the (82:10 - 82:14)
amount of damage you're outputting (82:13 - 82:18)
and then 250 two V's in attack speed and (82:14 - 82:22)
then four and HP your moves are going to (82:18 - 82:24)
be waterfall and stone edge for same (82:22 - 82:26)
type attack bonus also waterfall is (82:24 - 82:27)
going to be boosted in their reign (82:26 - 82:29)
anyway so that's going to hit very hard (82:27 - 82:33)
stone edge because that's the secondary (82:29 - 82:36)
ability of Kabutops Swords Dance if you (82:33 - 82:41)
is in there because it you're already (82:36 - 82:43)
dealing a lot of damage but sometimes if (82:41 - 82:45)
you're up against something like maybe a (82:43 - 82:46)
cèlle Stila (82:45 - 82:50)
that's been that's been granted a boost (82:46 - 82:54)
to its defenses from like ultra boost is (82:50 - 82:56)
that what that ability is called you can (82:54 - 82:58)
I think it's a beast boost beast boost (82:56 - 83:02)
there we go you can increase your attack (82:58 - 83:04)
by two stages to be able to break (83:02 - 83:06)
through walls like that and then the (83:04 - 83:09)
last move Kevin recommends either (83:06 - 83:12)
Aquajet for priority super power for (83:09 - 83:15)
more coverage or protect because protect (83:12 - 83:17)
is always quite good if you want to take (83:15 - 83:20)
that move set to the real world (83:17 - 83:23)
battlefield my transition was not as (83:20 - 83:26)
good as Jeff's system yeah each ride in (83:23 - 83:29)
Pokemon go the best move set you can (83:26 - 83:32)
have 4 good boo tops is fury cutter and (83:29 - 83:34)
stone edge now one of the reasons I (83:32 - 83:36)
picked Kabutops was because we are (83:34 - 83:38)
getting Moltres next as our legendary (83:36 - 83:41)
Pokemon in the wild while Kabutops isn't (83:38 - 83:43)
the best choice for Maul trees it is (83:41 - 83:45)
still a pretty good Pokemon to use (83:43 - 83:48)
because of the rock and water typing the (83:45 - 83:51)
unfortunate thing here is while fury (83:48 - 83:54)
cutter is one of the better fast type (83:51 - 83:57)
attacks for Kabutops rock smash is also (83:54 - 84:00)
decent but you're not you're not getting (83:57 - 84:03)
a stab on any of these mud shot is your (84:00 - 84:06)
third best move so the fast moves are (84:03 - 84:08)
either fury cutter rock smash or mud (84:06 - 84:11)
shot fury cutter being the best mud shot (84:08 - 84:13)
being the worst because none of the none (84:11 - 84:15)
of those get stabbed which is (84:13 - 84:17)
unfortunate and if you're unfamiliar of (84:15 - 84:19)
what stab is it's the same type attacked (84:17 - 84:22)
bonus so for googoo tops it would be any (84:19 - 84:24)
rock type moves and (84:22 - 84:26)
water-type moves and those three fast (84:24 - 84:28)
attacks i've read off neither our rock (84:26 - 84:31)
or water stone edge is going to be your (84:28 - 84:32)
best charge tight move which would do (84:31 - 84:36)
which should work mult Reese pretty well (84:32 - 84:38)
water pulse is going to be the second (84:36 - 84:41)
best move again going to do some hard (84:38 - 84:44)
work on multis ancient power is going to (84:41 - 84:46)
be the worst charge type move but again (84:44 - 84:48)
in this situation still pretty good form (84:46 - 84:51)
all trees Kabutops is not as good as (84:48 - 84:54)
probably what would be omastar to use (84:51 - 84:56)
again small trees which is best move set (84:54 - 84:58)
is rock throwed and hydro pump both are (84:56 - 85:01)
stab type moves both are super effective (84:58 - 85:04)
against small trees but again if you're (85:01 - 85:05)
going in battle against this legendary (85:04 - 85:07)
Pokemon you're going to have the (85:05 - 85:09)
resistance against love the flying-type (85:07 - 85:11)
that mouthpiece is doing and you're (85:09 - 85:13)
going to have the resistance against the (85:11 - 85:17)
fire type so personally Kabutops not a (85:13 - 85:19)
terrible choice for this week's (85:17 - 85:22)
legendary Pokemon if if you happen to (85:19 - 85:24)
find a mole trees and more importantly (85:22 - 85:27)
if you happen to find a group to do both (85:24 - 85:29)
there a mole trees with in battle I've (85:27 - 85:31)
got a lot of response that people like (85:29 - 85:33)
to the Pokemon go move set so there you (85:31 - 85:37)
go if you enjoyed both the Travis move (85:33 - 85:39)
set for Sun and Moon and the Pokemon (85:37 - 85:43)
goes like heaven move said please let us (85:39 - 85:46)
know via Twitter or slack or whatever (85:43 - 85:49)
some trivia real quick in Pokemon Red (85:46 - 85:51)
and Blue beta Kabutops was really was (85:49 - 85:55)
originally known as lantus de la deliver (85:51 - 85:58)
drives derived from the word Atlantis (85:55 - 86:02)
Kabutops has a scientific name Kabutops (85:58 - 86:06)
Maximus which is stated in fossil-fuel (86:02 - 86:10)
fools is this spell Ron Fool's fossil I (86:06 - 86:12)
think is it's a anime episode title and (86:10 - 86:16)
they're all puns so fossil fossil fuels (86:12 - 86:22)
got it in the other Pokemon known with a (86:16 - 86:26)
scientific name is oddish with audio (86:22 - 86:30)
wonderous the name Kabutops maximus does (86:26 - 86:32)
have a row meaning when it's translated (86:30 - 86:35)
it means the largest Kabuto face (86:32 - 86:37)
referring to the size and shape of could (86:35 - 86:38)
boot (86:37 - 86:40)
copses head Kabutops and its pre (86:38 - 86:42)
evolution share the same category name (86:40 - 86:45)
with Blastoise they are all known as the (86:42 - 86:49)
shellfish Pokemon hmm and Blastoise (86:45 - 86:53)
isn't a fish at all it's the turtle (86:49 - 86:57)

weird (86:57 - 87:00)
well it has a shell that has it that (86:57 - 87:01)
going for it (87:00 - 87:05)
