pretty much it (2:33 - 2:37)

good void of both Pokemon and non (2:43 - 2:47)
Pokemon related questions that you guys (2:46 - 2:51)

saying that it is my favorite Zelda of (4:36 - 4:42)
all time bar not time-barred none if you (4:38 - 4:45)

you see it would you say it a breath new (4:45 - 4:51)
life into the French hi yes I was really (4:48 - 4:56)
I would use the word breath it was very (4:51 - 4:59)
very good I think I'm Landon saying that (4:56 - 5:02)
anything hours and topped it for me (4:59 - 5:04)

what about winwaker winwaker is pretty (5:04 - 5:09)
good it was good but it doesn't do all (5:07 - 5:10)
of the amazing things that breadth of (5:09 - 5:12)
the wild does you're right it breath a (5:10 - 5:14)
while doesn't have a great boat that (5:12 - 5:17)

on a boat and then handle it yourself (5:17 - 5:22)
like say the job yeah you can pretend (5:19 - 5:25)
it's talking to you ah they should have (5:22 - 5:27)

rice happen for eyes yeah I'll never (5:35 - 5:41)
stop trying to make boat race happen (5:40 - 5:44)
Travis are you still playing pokemon (5:41 - 5:47)
duel oh no you've asked me that before (5:44 - 5:50)
and my answer was no like three weeks (5:47 - 5:52)
you know I wasn't sure c'mon evil isn't (5:50 - 5:54)
even on my phone anymore you why you (5:52 - 5:58)
come on doors yeah you're right you were (5:54 - 6:00)
so into Pokemon duel and then I I think (5:58 - 6:03)
I convinced you to switch to fire emblem (6:00 - 6:05)
and so are you still playing fire of (6:03 - 6:09)
them yeah I might I mean I don't want to (6:05 - 6:14)
be painted as like the number one that (6:09 - 6:16)
at any point I was like the number one (6:14 - 6:18)
Pokemon tool player on the world or (6:16 - 6:20)
anything I just thought it was a decent (6:18 - 6:25)
game too don't lie man I saw your (6:20 - 6:28)
Pokemon duel youtube channel yeah your (6:25 - 6:29)
Pokemon hey everybody here this is a (6:28 - 6:32)
dual master 69 69 coming in here with (6:29 - 6:34)
some hot tips you're gonna want to make (6:32 - 6:37)
sure you have the pieces with at least (6:34 - 6:40)
one or two pieces with three movement (6:37 - 6:41)
points you know moving point is actually (6:40 - 6:44)
the strongest stat in the game and if (6:41 - 6:46)
you're looking at a Pokemon with only (6:44 - 6:49)
one movement point I mean maybe put one (6:46 - 6:51)
of those on your team but you know I (6:49 - 6:53)
know you think like tyranitar oh it's so (6:51 - 6:54)
cool but like you really got to make (6:53 - 6:55)
sure you pay attention to movement (6:54 - 6:57)
points you need at least two or three (6:55 - 7:00)
and maybe one with one and the rest are (6:57 - 7:02)
our two but even then that (7:00 - 7:03)
with one is really gonna be hindering (7:02 - 7:05)
you because the movement point is the (7:03 - 7:07)
most important thing I'll just stop I'm (7:05 - 7:10)
sorry that was actually not Travis (7:07 - 7:12)
recording that that was actually a clip (7:10 - 7:15)
that we just played back from travis's (7:12 - 7:19)
Pokemon duel youtube channel I feel like (7:15 - 7:22)
you have the the the speed down of how (7:19 - 7:26)
fast youtubers talk I and yet time you (7:22 - 7:28)
have hey whats up guys that's the (7:26 - 7:30)
important part hey what's going on (7:28 - 7:34)
Gaia's because apparently no one other (7:30 - 7:37)
than men watches YouTube according to (7:34 - 7:39)
anyone who makes YouTube channels it so (7:37 - 7:40)
you know what's up hey guys it's your (7:39 - 7:45)
boy yeah uh and with regard to the speed (7:40 - 7:47)
of speaking I think I've talked it on (7:45 - 7:51)
the show about how I for a while was an (7:47 - 7:54)
assistant coach of a debate team the (7:51 - 7:57)
type of debate that I coached encouraged (7:54 - 8:00)
the rules of that type of debate sort of (7:57 - 8:02)
tacit Lee encouraged speaking as quickly (8:00 - 8:05)
as humanly possible is that is there a (8:02 - 8:07)
benefit there is there like six strategy (8:05 - 8:10)
there like that immunity if a strategic (8:07 - 8:13)
choice because at that type of debate (8:10 - 8:15)
which is called policy debate isn't (8:13 - 8:16)
necessarily about who is the most (8:15 - 8:19)
persuasive speaker but it's more about (8:16 - 8:23)
whose point is proved more by the facts (8:19 - 8:25)
that are presented in the round so (8:23 - 8:28)
because of that you're you have an (8:25 - 8:32)
incentive to just put out as many claims (8:28 - 8:34)
and warrants to those claims as is (8:32 - 8:37)
physically possible with your mouth and (8:34 - 8:39)
your vocal folds so that when your (8:37 - 8:43)
opponent goes up to speak they don't (8:39 - 8:45)
have enough time in there eight minute (8:43 - 8:47)
speech to make a response to all the (8:45 - 8:49)
things you said so you just end up (8:47 - 8:51)
winning because you said more things so (8:49 - 8:53)
it ends up being sort of a weird race to (8:51 - 8:57)
the bottom that sounds awful if you want (8:53 - 8:58)
if you want to have a good time good (8:57 - 9:00)
just go on youtube and search policy (8:58 - 9:02)
debate spreading spreading is the term (9:00 - 9:07)
they use it's quite a sight or quite an (9:02 - 9:09)
audible experience well speaking of (9:07 - 9:12)
spreading let's spread some Pokemon news (9:09 - 9:15)
out on the table here that was a much (9:12 - 9:15)
better (9:15 - 9:18)
segue Thank You Alan take it wit wasn't (9:15 - 9:21)
great but it definitely a B effort you (9:18 - 9:23)
know that they call me you they don't (9:21 - 9:26)
call me SB effort J for anything for (9:23 - 9:30)
nothing I call you a space cowboy shiny (9:26 - 9:33)
top Coco to be distributed in South (9:30 - 9:36)
Korea haven't had some South Korea news (9:33 - 9:38)
in a while but the Korean league spring (9:36 - 9:41)
tournament will get these shiny top of (9:38 - 9:44)
cocoa the Korean League tournament is (9:41 - 9:46)
held between 12pm to 5pm on april eighth (9:44 - 9:49)
and ninth at the Topaz hall on the 10th (9:46 - 9:52)
floor of the pangoro hyundai department (9:49 - 9:54)
store the taboo cocoa will be (9:52 - 9:58)
distributed via infrared for pokemon sun (9:54 - 10:01)
and moon during the tournament the taboo (9:58 - 10:03)
cocoa will be level 60 have the ability (10:01 - 10:06)
electric surge hold an electric seed and (10:03 - 10:08)
even though those were a thing I know (10:06 - 10:11)
the moves nature madness discharge (10:08 - 10:15)
agility and electro ball it's a regional (10:11 - 10:16)
trainer is something in Korean that I (10:15 - 10:18)
cannot say but it will be found in a (10:16 - 10:22)
cherish ball while top of cocoa in the (10:18 - 10:25)
game cannot be shiny making the Japanese (10:22 - 10:27)
distribution the only way to obtain it (10:25 - 10:30)
at pres is this true you can I get taboo (10:27 - 10:32)
Coco's taboo anything as shiny you can't (10:30 - 10:35)
soft reset for these I don't believe so (10:32 - 10:38)
huh happy nothing that's I I would be a (10:35 - 10:40)
fan of that just kind of gets rid of the (10:38 - 10:42)
whole software is set anything that gets (10:40 - 10:44)
off resetting it doesn't really good (10:42 - 10:46)
because then you need to starts off (10:44 - 10:49)
resetting for free and IVs and and stuff (10:46 - 10:52)
good to know that what was the munchies (10:49 - 10:54)
that you hadn't heard of maybe a couple (10:52 - 10:56)
extras with need electric seed yes so (10:54 - 10:58)
that's a is that new of Sun and Moon (10:56 - 11:03)
yeah it's a new held item what happens (10:58 - 11:05)
is it's a one-time use item so after you (11:03 - 11:08)
use it it's consumed although you can (11:05 - 11:10)
all of those sort of one-time use items (11:08 - 11:12)
if you use them in a competitive match (11:10 - 11:15)
over like a Wi-Fi battle than those (11:12 - 11:18)
items come back but if you use it like (11:15 - 11:20)
just in single-player it's one time use (11:18 - 11:22)
but anyway electric seat is an item that (11:20 - 11:28)
will raise the defense of a Pokemon when (11:22 - 11:29)
electric terrain (11:28 - 11:32)
is activated so because taboo cocoa (11:29 - 11:34)
causes a like electric terrain to (11:32 - 11:39)
activate just by its ability electric (11:34 - 11:42)
surge then it basically guarantees that (11:39 - 11:45)
electric seed will pop off increasing (11:42 - 11:48)
its defense by a stage so you get a free (11:45 - 11:50)
defense increase just right off the bat (11:48 - 11:53)
not a lot of people use it use like (11:50 - 11:54)
taboo cocoa with electric seed (11:53 - 11:55)
competitively because there are a lot (11:54 - 11:59)
better items you could use you know like (11:55 - 12:00)
focus ash gets a lot of use and I think (11:59 - 12:03)
life orb is the life orb and focus sash (12:00 - 12:06)
I think of the items that get use but I (12:03 - 12:08)
mean electric seat is there and it's an (12:06 - 12:11)
item cool good no Pokemon goes latest (12:08 - 12:14)
event is making everyone a Magikarp fan (12:11 - 12:16)
this article is off polygon I had just a (12:14 - 12:19)
the standard Pokemon go press release up (12:16 - 12:21)
but really what it says is that there (12:19 - 12:25)
are now more water pokemon for the link (12:21 - 12:29)
was water yeah water festival is what (12:25 - 12:31)
it's called it will have more water (12:29 - 12:33)
pokemon including Magikarp squirtle (12:31 - 12:35)
totodile another water pokemon more (12:33 - 12:37)
accessible that means if you don't live (12:35 - 12:39)
close to water and had difficulties (12:37 - 12:42)
encountering the set pokemon spending (12:39 - 12:44)
more ink in game time over the next week (12:42 - 12:47)
will increase your chances this will end (12:44 - 12:50)
on march 29th at four pm eastern time (12:47 - 12:52)
that was what i was looking for the end (12:50 - 12:56)
date but just like the last couple (12:52 - 12:58)
special events well well there's the (12:56 - 13:00)
holiday event which gave you the pikachu (12:58 - 13:04)
with the santa claus hat and then they (13:00 - 13:08)
gave their was the event to celebrate (13:04 - 13:12)
the 21st birthday of pokemon which gave (13:08 - 13:14)
you the pichu with the party hat looks (13:12 - 13:17)
like this event will give you a shiny (13:14 - 13:19)
magikarp if you are lucky enough and of (13:17 - 13:21)
course evolving that shiny magikarp will (13:19 - 13:24)
evolve into a shiny gyarados this is the (13:21 - 13:27)
first time we've seen a shiny in in (13:24 - 13:31)
pokemon go legally / officially i don't (13:27 - 13:33)
know what what other people are doing (13:31 - 13:36)
but legally first time we're getting (13:33 - 13:38)
shiny pokemon somebody in slacked a (13:36 - 13:41)
quick quick side story so there there (13:38 - 13:43)
ditto in the game (13:41 - 13:46)
then somebody found a shiny magikarp and (13:43 - 13:49)
they went to catch it and it turned into (13:46 - 13:53)
a ditto no way which is a real i would (13:49 - 13:56)
probably quit her mom go forever ah (13:53 - 13:59)
there's also an in celebration of (13:56 - 14:01)
Pokemon go water festival there is a (13:59 - 14:04)
all-new Magikarp at that is free that (14:01 - 14:06)
you can add to your wardrobe I don't (14:04 - 14:09)
know if the Hat yours alone it's great i (14:06 - 14:11)
don't know if the hat goes away I March (14:09 - 14:13)
twenty ninth and we don't know if if the (14:11 - 14:16)
the shiny magikarp also goes away on (14:13 - 14:19)
march 29th I'm assuming it does just (14:16 - 14:21)
because Pikachu party hat and peachy (14:19 - 14:24)
Santa hat went away so we'll see and I (14:21 - 14:25)
and I keep forgetting talk about this (14:24 - 14:27)
week after week but I've been playing a (14:25 - 14:30)
lot of Pokemon go ever since the johto (14:27 - 14:32)
pokemon got introduced I don't know if (14:30 - 14:34)
you two have been ailing it but I had (14:32 - 14:36)
like one actually strangely i actually (14:34 - 14:37)
have and mostly just because it's been (14:36 - 14:39)
really rainy around here it's gotten (14:37 - 14:41)
warmer but it's just been so rainy that (14:39 - 14:43)
i don't really have any yeah i've done I (14:41 - 14:45)
mean it's the same in Wisconsin right (14:43 - 14:47)
it's really cold so it's kind of hard to (14:45 - 14:49)
walk around but they added a bunch of (14:47 - 14:52)
new polka stops in the park near my work (14:49 - 14:55)
mica mica knows what park i'm talking (14:52 - 14:57)
about but that park originally only had (14:55 - 15:01)
like three polka stops like a year ago (14:57 - 15:03)
and they added by the way I don't work (15:01 - 15:05)
in Milwaukee I work in the middle of (15:03 - 15:08)
nowhere yeah there's still all that news (15:05 - 15:09)
about Milwaukee freaking out about (15:08 - 15:11)
Pokemon go and stuff and we'll probably (15:09 - 15:13)
have I'm waiting for more information (15:11 - 15:14)
but there is a there would have been a (15:13 - 15:16)
news article about that but anyways they (15:14 - 15:17)
pretty much doubled the amount of polka (15:16 - 15:20)
stops so from at least my desk I can see (15:17 - 15:22)
which pokémon are over in the park so my (15:20 - 15:24)
lunch I'll walk drive through the park (15:22 - 15:26)
because this because with the parking (15:24 - 15:29)
lot in the park touches like for polka (15:26 - 15:30)
stop so i'll drive into the park park (15:29 - 15:34)
spin catch and then go go actually get (15:30 - 15:35)
my lunch and then return to work so (15:34 - 15:38)
that's like I don't know it's it's like (15:35 - 15:41)
10 minutes out of my day but I get at (15:38 - 15:43)
least one or two new pokemon that I (15:41 - 15:45)
haven't had before and yet that streak (15:43 - 15:47)
hey yeah you gotta hit that streak you (15:45 - 15:51)
got a new streak I have such I have so (15:47 - 15:52)
much trouble hitting that seven-day (15:51 - 15:54)
street because of weekends because I (15:52 - 15:57)
I'll usually go out on like a Saturday (15:54 - 16:00)
or sunday but I try not to go out one of (15:57 - 16:01)
those two days like just just the whole (16:00 - 16:03)
like well if I don't drive anywhere I (16:01 - 16:05)
can't spend any money right so I tried (16:03 - 16:07)
to do that once a week like I'm not (16:05 - 16:09)
going anywhere today just gonna stay at (16:07 - 16:11)
home and there's no poker stops near me (16:09 - 16:13)
unless I walk there and then that goes (16:11 - 16:14)
back to the whole thing of like it's (16:13 - 16:17)
really cool Wisconsin right now well the (16:14 - 16:19)
only solution is to move to a building (16:17 - 16:21)
that is either on top of a right next to (16:19 - 16:24)
a polka star yeah yeah is when I plan on (16:21 - 16:28)
buying a house the buck stops near it (16:24 - 16:31)
will will play a big role but you see (16:28 - 16:34)
that's dating bettering the housing (16:31 - 16:37)
market right yes so Mike a year you're (16:34 - 16:40)
playing pokemon go again I am yeah I've (16:37 - 16:42)
been playing it since jodoh too and I (16:40 - 16:45)
played it I hit like a really big spike (16:42 - 16:48)
right when joto launched and I've (16:45 - 16:50)
tapered off a little bit now but I'm (16:48 - 16:52)
still playing it pretty consistently and (16:50 - 16:57)
I have never really noticed before just (16:52 - 17:00)
because of my I guess activity level in (16:57 - 17:02)
the game the increased spawns when (17:00 - 17:03)
they've done increased bonds before but (17:02 - 17:05)
I am definitely noticing the increased (17:03 - 17:07)
waters bones like it's significant I'm (17:05 - 17:10)
happy that it's significant because I've (17:07 - 17:13)
always felt like oh it's increased bonds (17:10 - 17:15)
and it's I can see that like oh maybe (17:13 - 17:16)
I'm seeing some of that like when they (17:15 - 17:18)
did the increase bonds for the starters (17:16 - 17:20)
like I didn't really see that many I (17:18 - 17:23)
think other people probably did but I (17:20 - 17:25)
didn't so this time it's nice to be able (17:23 - 17:28)
to actually see increased bonds for (17:25 - 17:30)
water stuff I have yet to find a shiny (17:28 - 17:33)
magikarp uh but I have found it yeah I (17:30 - 17:36)
haven't found a shiny magikarp either (17:33 - 17:38)
now like I'm kind of stressing out (17:36 - 17:40)
because the the the end date is coming (17:38 - 17:43)
up and I yet have both the special (17:40 - 17:45)
Pikachu's so like I will be really (17:43 - 17:47)
bummed i think if i don't don't get a (17:45 - 17:49)
shiny the same position like I see (17:47 - 17:52)
plenty of regular Magikarp just not (17:49 - 17:55)

first episode it hits japanese theaters (19:22 - 19:29)
on July fifteenth is it a new animation (19:24 - 19:33)

movie animation yeah the upcoming in see (19:43 - 19:51)
the trailer no I didn't ah is it good (19:47 - 19:52)
trailer it looks remember we talked (19:51 - 19:54)
about this last time it doesn't said (19:52 - 19:56)
that I never watched I didn't watch it (19:54 - 19:57)
yeah it doesn't look like I stole them (19:56 - 20:00)
it doesn't look like the sun and moon (19:57 - 20:03)
anime it just looks like the last movie (20:00 - 20:07)
animation that's kind of I mean you know (20:03 - 20:08)
whatever it's a little disappointing (20:07 - 20:10)
because I really like the animation and (20:08 - 20:12)
cinnamon but I think the sunday moon (20:10 - 20:17)
cartoon anime Hana may I think it's I (20:12 - 20:20)
think I think it's all right I don't (20:17 - 20:21)
know if there's more than two episodes (20:20 - 20:23)
yet I haven't recorded on my my (20:21 - 20:24)
playstation view but I don't (20:23 - 20:27)
they've shown episode three yet what's a (20:24 - 20:29)
Playstation of you that's a new 1i (20:27 - 20:34)
PlayStation view is internet TV so for (20:29 - 20:39)
29 bucks a month it gets you like 35 (20:34 - 20:44)
channel 35 channel more than that maybe (20:39 - 20:47)
drop in thirty dollars 39 it's it's (20:44 - 20:50)
basically like cable but you're paying (20:47 - 20:51)
less for cable and you get pretty much (20:50 - 20:53)
everything you need for cable yeah it (20:51 - 20:55)
gives me it you get all of the channels (20:53 - 20:58)
that it that like cable would get you (20:55 - 21:00)
yeah like hgtv and Cartoon Network and (20:58 - 21:03)
whatever yeah so you watch it on your TV (21:00 - 21:05)
or your PlayStation I think Apple TV (21:03 - 21:08)
also has an app or chromecast but you (21:05 - 21:09)
get the Food Network you get food (21:08 - 21:11)
network yeah you get a bunch of chain (21:09 - 21:13)
might be where it might be worth it for (21:11 - 21:15)
thirty bucks worth it what's really cool (21:13 - 21:17)
so first off it gives you USA Today he (21:15 - 21:19)
gives us a which is how I watch my (21:17 - 21:21)
wrestling not USA Today right now you (21:19 - 21:25)
see that rested ah I guess you it gives (21:21 - 21:27)
you disney XD which lets you do all your (21:25 - 21:30)
Pokemon now mmm you Cartoon Network (21:27 - 21:33)
which used to do pokemon and I don't I (21:30 - 21:34)
don't think they're all they're not (21:33 - 21:37)
allowed to show reruns gives you TBS if (21:34 - 21:40)
you if you need your Seinfeld kick but (21:37 - 21:41)
what's really cool is it has like this (21:40 - 21:44)
DVR feature where you can say like hey (21:41 - 21:47)
record every episode of Pokemon and it (21:44 - 21:49)
doesn't care what channel it's on it'll (21:47 - 21:52)
just find that show and record it and it (21:49 - 21:54)
doesn't take up any storage on your (21:52 - 21:56)
device cuz everything this is starting (21:54 - 21:59)
to sound like that parable about the (21:56 - 22:01)
terrifying AI that goes and unselfish (21:59 - 22:03)
drawing the whole work because like you (22:01 - 22:07)
tell the AI like make make and store (22:03 - 22:09)
food for me and then the AI is like okay (22:07 - 22:12)
and that it ends up thinking well I can (22:09 - 22:15)
turn people into food and then destroys (22:12 - 22:18)
like everybody to make it sounds like if (22:15 - 22:20)
you're saying like record all episodes (22:18 - 22:23)
of Pokemon then it'll start like being (22:20 - 22:24)
like well this could theoretically be (22:23 - 22:28)
Pokemon so I should survey all of (22:24 - 22:30)
everything honest joke isn't really as (22:28 - 22:32)
funny as i thought it was ahead well (22:30 - 22:33)
that's the thing though right cuz its (22:32 - 22:36)
top model pokemon was I'm cartoonnetwork (22:33 - 22:38)
what so when I said hey record all poke (22:36 - 22:40)
mine when it made the jump to Disney (22:38 - 22:42)
that's cool I don't have to like retell (22:40 - 22:45)
it and then like like seinfeld is more (22:42 - 22:48)
just also it's like not all exclusively (22:45 - 22:52)
TBS so if there are other versions of it (22:48 - 22:53)
it will find those and record them and (22:52 - 22:55)
so then when you go to your like my (22:53 - 22:57)
shows if it found two of the same (22:55 - 22:59)
episode like hey we found Monday Night (22:57 - 23:02)
Raw on USA and sci-fi or whatever I (22:59 - 23:04)
don't think it's on self I it'll say (23:02 - 23:06)
which version do you want to watch now I (23:04 - 23:09)
know yeah PlayStation you know also (23:06 - 23:12)
actively so like you can set things to (23:09 - 23:15)
record to actually record or you can (23:12 - 23:17)
just select something as my show and (23:15 - 23:19)
then it will compile it and save it to (23:17 - 23:21)
like I don't know it just it's it's just (23:19 - 23:23)
like an available for on demand for (23:21 - 23:26)
anybody that saved it as their show so (23:23 - 23:27)
then there's two versions of that too (23:26 - 23:29)
like you can pick either the on-demand (23:27 - 23:33)
version or the version that you DVR'd as (23:29 - 23:36)
a whole new world of possibilities yeah (23:33 - 23:38)
I don't know if any of this is new for (23:36 - 23:41)
like as far as DVR goes but it's new to (23:38 - 23:44)
me cuz i've never had DVR before yeah i (23:41 - 23:46)
mean i don't use like i'll use the DVR (23:44 - 23:48)
feature to watch like reruns of shows or (23:46 - 23:50)
something but for the most part like my (23:48 - 23:52)
playstation view comes down to me using (23:50 - 23:54)
it every monday night for wrestling and (23:52 - 23:56)
then right what about those pokemon hats (23:54 - 23:59)
sorry I didn't mean it before anything (23:56 - 24:01)
sit down at the place a I feel I feel (23:59 - 24:03)
guilty for bringing things under the (24:01 - 24:04)
PlayStation view tangent just because I (24:03 - 24:06)
thought PlayStation view was a funny (24:04 - 24:08)
buzzword sounding branding term and now (24:06 - 24:10)
he spent like actually 20 minutes (24:08 - 24:11)
talking let the PlayStation to you and I (24:10 - 24:14)
feel bad so by 12 is leave a window that (24:11 - 24:17)
you through and it shows you can land a (24:14 - 24:22)
ship you a window to your house yes and (24:17 - 24:25)
in one pane that says play and then the (24:22 - 24:28)
other plane it says station and then (24:25 - 24:30)
when you're when you're sitting in front (24:28 - 24:35)
of it that is the view of the citation (24:30 - 24:37)
view it's a 24 it's a two pane window (24:35 - 24:39)

have easy solution think you were both (26:48 - 26:54)
on similar pages Chris rights in kind I (26:50 - 26:57)
just want to make sure that that that we (26:54 - 26:59)
weren't forming some sort of singularity (26:57 - 27:01)
where we end up with some like will and (26:59 - 27:04)
Travis Oversoul that just has all of the (27:01 - 27:07)
attributes of both of us and then both (27:04 - 27:09)
of us become obsolete you know like I (27:07 - 27:11)
want to make sure I'd or I am the one (27:09 - 27:13)
the hands Elda that's the one that's the (27:11 - 27:15)
one thing I have I don't know it sounds (27:13 - 27:17)
like a pretty good plot for the podcast (27:15 - 27:20)
if Travis and will becomes too similar (27:17 - 27:22)
then I just have to cut one right but (27:20 - 27:27)
how will you know which one is which so (27:22 - 27:30)
I'm going to ship you a window and in (27:27 - 27:31)
one pain it's gonna say flashing (27:30 - 27:34)
something only the real PlayStation of (27:31 - 27:39)
you will know this emails from chris (27:34 - 27:42)
from Indianapolis hey SBJ will and (27:39 - 27:46)
Travis it was a Chris been a while since (27:42 - 27:49)
I've seen or talked to you guys i just (27:46 - 27:51)
wanted to respond to Travis about (27:49 - 27:53)
Pokemon go and the antics methods for (27:51 - 27:54)
catching (27:53 - 27:57)
Legendary's there is a gym rework going (27:54 - 27:58)
on right now according to multiple (27:57 - 28:00)
reports and comments from developers (27:58 - 28:02)
that could be released sometime between (28:00 - 28:05)
april through june they are working on (28:02 - 28:06)
making the experience more teamwork (28:05 - 28:09)
focused and rewarding when people get (28:06 - 28:11)
involved so this leads me to believe (28:09 - 28:12)
that the possibility of catching a (28:11 - 28:15)
mewtwo like the trailer depicts may not (28:12 - 28:17)
be as far off as we think of course (28:15 - 28:19)
we'll see what they end up doing in the (28:17 - 28:21)
long term and hope for the best keep up (28:19 - 28:23)
the good work and Travis if you want (28:21 - 28:26)
mall Chinese again I still live here and (28:23 - 28:28)
we'll plan on going to Nationals if you (28:26 - 28:31)
guys make it to any oh I didn't realize (28:28 - 28:32)
I didn't realize we were talking that it (28:31 - 28:35)
was this chris cool awesome sincerely (28:32 - 28:37)
the original Chris yes the one you're (28:35 - 28:40)
thinking of from any probably idiot from (28:37 - 28:43)
you Chris probably the I mean the only (28:40 - 28:45)
Chris in all of India I'm assuming the (28:43 - 28:48)
only one that I know and care about so (28:45 - 28:50)
yeah they're there I have also heard (28:48 - 28:52)
this I've seen many things about this (28:50 - 28:55)
Jim rework I did I did speaking of (28:52 - 28:57)
Pokemon go I did my first gym battle (28:55 - 29:01)
since the first week it came out I was (28:57 - 29:06)
at a gym parked in my car and it was a (29:01 - 29:08)
mystic gym and I am mystic so I think it (29:06 - 29:10)
does something where like powers up the (29:08 - 29:13)
gym I wasn't completely sure what I got (29:10 - 29:15)
a bunch of experience when I was done (29:13 - 29:18)
but yeah man your buff in the gym okay (29:15 - 29:20)
well if I didn't it didn't give me an (29:18 - 29:21)
option to leave my pokemon even though I (29:20 - 29:24)
did the work it may not so it so you can (29:21 - 29:26)
leave Pokemon there at certain levels (29:24 - 29:29)
there's certain amounts that you can (29:26 - 29:32)
leave per level of the gym so it could (29:29 - 29:34)
be that you just didn't level it up so (29:32 - 29:35)
that there was more room for you to (29:34 - 29:37)
leave a Pokemon yeah I think that was a (29:35 - 29:39)
edit yeah there's a certain number at (29:37 - 29:42)
which another tier of another Pokemon (29:39 - 29:43)
slot would have been unlocked at which (29:42 - 29:45)
point you could have put a Pokemon there (29:43 - 29:47)
or I could have already been level 10 at (29:45 - 29:49)
which point no naughty yeah she's (29:47 - 29:51)
already smelled up it was it was in (29:49 - 29:53)
level 4 or 5 I don't have like my (29:51 - 29:56)
highest CP is like 13 90 or something so (29:53 - 29:59)
what I don't have stellar perfect IV (29:56 - 30:03)
pokemon i had what a casual so what you (29:59 - 30:05)
do then is you put something easy in (30:03 - 30:08)
there to make it easy for other (30:05 - 30:09)
what team what trash team are you on (30:08 - 30:13)
mystic mystic Oh gross so it had (30:09 - 30:15)
something easy in there so that other (30:13 - 30:17)
mystics have an easier time training the (30:15 - 30:20)
gym so you just drop like a Caterpie or (30:17 - 30:21)
something well i would i would assume if (30:20 - 30:24)
somebody rolled up with like CP 1600 (30:21 - 30:26)
they would have no problem because i (30:24 - 30:28)
thought they would blast it out of there (30:26 - 30:30)
for sure yeah cuz i think the max that (30:28 - 30:33)
at level 4 that I was seeing was was (30:30 - 30:35)
like 1500 so I was I was a I was a (30:33 - 30:37)
hundred to two hundred below that CP but (30:35 - 30:40)
I was still able to get through it right (30:37 - 30:44)
it nautical nautical strategy fun though (30:40 - 30:46)
like battling it in there in Pokemon go (30:44 - 30:50)
is not enjoyable no it's really not you (30:46 - 30:52)
just tap the screen a bunch time and (30:50 - 30:55)
then occasionally hold it but get in (30:52 - 30:57)
there and put some put some caterpie's (30:55 - 31:00)
on the gyms help out your teammates and (30:57 - 31:02)
then work it but you can't put don't (31:00 - 31:04)
have an easily to put you gotta put the (31:02 - 31:06)
caterpie's and work it up well yeah of (31:04 - 31:08)
course otherwise someone's gonna roll on (31:06 - 31:10)

her I mean they're kind of both on the (36:08 - 36:14)
same plane of interest as far as I'm (36:12 - 36:19)
concerned I attempted to shiny hunt for (36:14 - 36:23)
an execute and I did it for about five (36:19 - 36:27)

watering I decided to write in after (39:17 - 39:22)
listening to the whole wet burrito (39:20 - 39:25)
debate as I have a comment on what i (39:22 - 39:27)
believed is based on here in New Mexico (39:25 - 39:30)
we're getting that like raw cold hard (39:27 - 39:32)
facts here we I'm mexico's finest is (39:30 - 39:35)
written in here not cold and hard (39:32 - 39:38)
burritos that sounds gross here in (39:35 - 39:43)
Mexico the state of Jalisco to be (39:38 - 39:46)
precise uh we have a typical dish called (39:43 - 39:50)
the torterra agraja da which is the (39:46 - 39:53)
literal translation of drownded torta (39:50 - 39:56)
torta that consists in a toilet i wish i (39:53 - 40:00)
could see that habit or two yellow r T 0 (39:56 - 40:05)
r T 0 r TN torta that's what I said yeah (40:00 - 40:10)
well I mean that's kind of what you said (40:05 - 40:13)
it's good what is a torta is it just (40:10 - 40:16)
like a like a softshell taco I thought (40:13 - 40:18)
I'm probably way wrong in this but I (40:16 - 40:20)
thought tortas were like sandwiches oh (40:18 - 40:22)
actually it says here in the next (40:20 - 40:25)
sentence that consists in a torta a kind (40:22 - 40:27)
of sandwich made with a different bread (40:25 - 40:32)
called a bolio or Berto a burro brot (40:27 - 40:35)

how to pronounce it but hey i pronounce (40:36 - 40:41)
torture right he has requested me about (40:38 - 40:43)
it i said it right a filled with pork I (40:41 - 40:44)
didn't say anything about your total (40:43 - 40:47)
pronunciation and covered in tomato (40:44 - 40:50)
sauce with some red onion on it and you (40:47 - 40:52)
get to choose how spice you usually want (40:50 - 40:54)
it usually it is eaten when you are (40:52 - 40:56)
hungover and it's very tasty that's (40:54 - 40:58)
pretty much it so now I have questions (40:56 - 41:00)
for you to that are completely non (40:58 - 41:02)
Pokemon that are completely that are not (41:00 - 41:05)
completely pokeman related number one do (41:02 - 41:07)
you miss game Manuel's being physical (41:05 - 41:10)
included with every game I liked I loved (41:07 - 41:12)
reading those and the Pokemon ones were (41:10 - 41:15)
particularly awesome as long as they (41:12 - 41:16)
were long (41:15 - 41:18)
have so many illustrations and notes (41:16 - 41:20)
number two who is your favorite (41:18 - 41:22)
superhero that's it for my email I hope (41:20 - 41:24)
he gets right on the show keep being the (41:22 - 41:26)
best Pokemon podcast out there and we (41:24 - 41:29)
will keep making sure of keeping them (41:26 - 41:34)
dogs clean this 2017 glad to hear it (41:29 - 41:36)
let's do a superhero question question (41:34 - 41:38)
one first because I can tell you right (41:36 - 41:39)
now I don't have a favorite superhero (41:38 - 41:43)
I'm not big on superheroes or comics or (41:39 - 41:46)
anything like that oh I guess I'll I'll (41:43 - 41:52)
go my answer used to be green lantern (41:46 - 41:56)
because I like the idea of a superhero (41:52 - 41:59)
that wasn't just I mean you get this in (41:56 - 42:02)
tons of different superheroes whether (41:59 - 42:04)
you're talking DC or marvel where (42:02 - 42:07)
multiple people have inhabited the same (42:04 - 42:11)
role the same the same name but Green (42:07 - 42:13)
Lantern was always interesting to me (42:11 - 42:16)
that the green lantern for this sector (42:13 - 42:19)
in in space was just like one person out (42:16 - 42:21)
of tons that were assigned to all of the (42:19 - 42:23)
sectors of space i thought that was (42:21 - 42:25)
interesting that like in the cosmic (42:23 - 42:27)
scope of things this person who seems (42:25 - 42:30)
like immensely powerful from our tiny (42:27 - 42:33)
earth perspective is just one of a ton (42:30 - 42:35)
that that are in that green lantern (42:33 - 42:36)
corps i found that idea interesting um (42:35 - 42:38)
and then I actually like red green (42:36 - 42:40)
lantern comics and they're they're (42:38 - 42:44)
boring and really and spend way too much (42:40 - 42:46)
time talking about how different (42:44 - 42:48)
emotions are like different colors and (42:46 - 42:50)
I'm in a lot it was it different what (42:48 - 42:53)
the different like colored rings do and (42:50 - 42:58)
that ended up boring me um I I like I (42:53 - 43:00)
haven't I don't know if I could pick one (42:58 - 43:02)
of them but in terms of like comic (43:00 - 43:04)
series I'm kind of interested in the (43:02 - 43:06)
x-men right now maybe it's just because (43:04 - 43:08)
I really enjoyed Logan so I'm going back (43:06 - 43:10)
and looking at some old x-men stories (43:08 - 43:12)
but I there have been some interesting (43:10 - 43:13)
x-men stories and I think a lot of the (43:12 - 43:16)
characters are have interesting (43:13 - 43:18)
analogues to real life and like real (43:16 - 43:21)
life experiences so that's cool real (43:18 - 43:22)
quick before I answer can I get a hot (43:21 - 43:25)
take and Logan did you like it oh yeah I (43:22 - 43:27)
thought it was really good I think it's (43:25 - 43:29)
laudable for being (43:27 - 43:33)
movie that said that for being a comic (43:29 - 43:35)
book movie that dares to actually say a (43:33 - 43:37)
thing in a world where everyone is (43:35 - 43:40)
falling head over heels over a Deadpool (43:37 - 43:42)
which is a movie that's purely pessimism (43:40 - 43:44)
and deconstruction for the sake of (43:42 - 43:46)
nothingness that even the same studio (43:44 - 43:49)
decided well we can actually maybe say (43:46 - 43:51)
something this time and they did and (43:49 - 43:54)
it's good i'm excited to see it i I (43:51 - 43:56)
that's because I'm also kind of going (43:54 - 43:58)
back and before I see it I guess I want (43:56 - 44:01)
to see some of the source material and (43:58 - 44:03)
I'm going through some House of M stuff (44:01 - 44:07)
that apparently is partially tied to it (44:03 - 44:08)
and then going through some Logan I know (44:07 - 44:10)
I don't really necessary I don't (44:08 - 44:12)
necessarily think you really need to (44:10 - 44:14)
read the source material material it's (44:12 - 44:16)
mostly like the old man Logan stuff that (44:14 - 44:20)
is based on I yes but I mean it's less (44:16 - 44:24)
of a x-men movie and more of just a road (44:20 - 44:26)
picture that happens to have Wolverine (44:24 - 44:29)
and a lot of people's faces being (44:26 - 44:32)
brutally ripped apart by metal claws oh (44:29 - 44:34)
okay yeah I don't really have a favorite (44:32 - 44:36)
superhero either but I have a lot of (44:34 - 44:39)
favorite like story arcs throughout yeah (44:36 - 44:43)
the history of Marvel Comics not so much (44:39 - 44:46)
TC I'm not that big of a I've never (44:43 - 44:49)
really been big into DC comics but um I (44:46 - 44:50)
don't know like the original Civil War (44:49 - 44:53)
ark was really interesting to me and the (44:50 - 44:57)
split sides and lives like unmasking (44:53 - 45:00)
superheroes and big reveals and stuff (44:57 - 45:01)
like that was really cool to me other (45:00 - 45:03)
than that I don't think anybody has ever (45:01 - 45:05)
really like stuck out to me when I was (45:03 - 45:07)
young I really liked gambit because he (45:05 - 45:09)
was a babe other than I don't think of (45:07 - 45:13)
did you watch the x-men cartoon I did (45:09 - 45:18)
yes man lady nee nee nee nee nee nee nee (45:13 - 45:24)
nee nee ah such a good opener frog he's (45:18 - 45:26)
a babe in that too (45:24 - 45:26)
bonini an excuse me steve is dreading (45:28 - 45:40)
editing this right yeah I deem as far (45:36 - 45:42)
away from my microphone it's fine do you (45:40 - 45:45)
miss gay man he was being physically (45:42 - 45:47)
included with every game was the other (45:45 - 45:50)
question from Jose did any of the when (45:47 - 45:52)
did they stop including gay manuals and (45:50 - 45:54)
pokemon games I don't know I bought the (45:52 - 45:58)
last two digitally yeah I did I mean I (45:54 - 46:00)
did too I like bought physical ones (45:58 - 46:02)
button open them they're kind of like (46:00 - 46:05)
just for collection sake but hacen (46:02 - 46:07)
everyone why they were looting manual (46:05 - 46:11)
Jill had a menu whoa no I won't be able (46:07 - 46:13)
to confirm this I because I never have (46:11 - 46:15)
really cared that much about manuals I (46:13 - 46:17)
started playing video games before i (46:15 - 46:19)
could read so the manual was never (46:17 - 46:22)
really that important of i couldn't read (46:19 - 46:24)
the manual so it wasn't ever that an (46:22 - 46:27)
important part has started to care about (46:24 - 46:31)
manuals for collections purpose for (46:27 - 46:34)
collection purposes like collecting (46:31 - 46:35)
complete versions of games and things (46:34 - 46:38)
like that but i guess that i mean i just (46:35 - 46:39)
kind of stopped doing that I guess I (46:38 - 46:40)
didn't realize that they stopped (46:39 - 46:44)
including manuals of a lot of nintendo (46:40 - 46:45)
stuff specifically because i feel like (46:44 - 46:48)
that was still when other companies had (46:45 - 46:50)
dropped off of carrying man you're (46:48 - 46:53)
putting manuals in Game cases Nintendo (46:50 - 46:55)
was still doing that IRA I mean I (46:53 - 46:57)
remember the red and blue manuals and (46:55 - 46:58)
like going through those as a kid (46:57 - 47:00)
several times and how it looked like a (46:58 - 47:02)
little like field guide kind of book (47:00 - 47:06)
that manual just stood out to me and (47:02 - 47:08)
still does stand out to me but for the (47:06 - 47:11)
most part I don't know I I manuals (47:08 - 47:13)
probably for me to do the same effect of (47:11 - 47:16)
art books and like I have destiny art (47:13 - 47:18)
books in final fantasy 14 art books and (47:16 - 47:21)
you know other art books just sitting on (47:18 - 47:23)
a shelf and I think I've maybe page (47:21 - 47:26)
through them once and it was like a (47:23 - 47:28)
quick page 3 of like oh yeah this is (47:26 - 47:30)
good paper quality this art school and (47:28 - 47:33)
then it just collects dust on my shelf (47:30 - 47:35)
and I think for me manuals would do the (47:33 - 47:38)
same acceptance of collecting dust on my (47:35 - 47:40)
shelf it would just remain in the game (47:38 - 47:41)
case (47:40 - 47:44)
yeah I think I mean as far as having the (47:41 - 47:46)
actual manuals I think it's more just (47:44 - 47:48)
like it's nice to have it then it is (47:46 - 47:51)
something out of tangible right more (47:48 - 47:53)
than it has any actual practical use (47:51 - 47:56)
like I'm not I I'm not like lost without (47:53 - 48:00)
a manual you know yeah I don't i think (47:56 - 48:01)
it was much more needed in times where (48:00 - 48:05)
games weren't super clear on how to play (48:01 - 48:07)
certain parts of it like they didn't (48:05 - 48:11)
have hand like like walk walking hand (48:07 - 48:13)
holding tutorials at the beginning of (48:11 - 48:16)
the game and stuff like that next email (48:13 - 48:20)
here is actually some physical mail (48:16 - 48:24)
unfold this here some snail mail as they (48:20 - 48:27)

you'd want to see or expanded upon or (50:45 - 50:49)
anything like that well real quick I'd (50:47 - 50:51)
like to see more mimic you plushies (50:49 - 50:54)
because I recently went to find them (50:51 - 50:56)
outside of Pokemon Center calm because (50:54 - 50:57)
they haven't restocked and they're on (50:56 - 50:59)
ebay for like eighty dollars so you're (50:57 - 51:02)
saying I should sell my plush yes i'll (50:59 - 51:04)
sell it to you for 70 how's that well (51:02 - 51:08)
I'm out not not interested in dollars (51:04 - 51:11)
less than ebay it's a deal of the (51:08 - 51:13)
century right there that I mean you're (51:11 - 51:16)
not wrong but don't don't do this to me (51:13 - 51:18)
I'm real desperate for a mimic you plush (51:16 - 51:21)
and I can't be I can't be spending (51:18 - 51:25)
seventy dollars on plush I'm trying to (51:21 - 51:29)
think of what I would want to see (51:25 - 51:31)
there's a lot of pokemon stuff i have my (51:29 - 51:33)
house I've Pokemon blankets Pokemon (51:31 - 51:37)

back around I can subscribe to this you (51:57 - 52:01)

decent Pokemon hoodies not the ones they (52:01 - 52:07)
sell on Pokemon Center that are that are (52:05 - 52:09)
60 to 70 dollars because that is a (52:07 - 52:11)
ridiculous price for a hoodie you could (52:09 - 52:14)
get a plush for that you can mimic you (52:11 - 52:15)
plush for that i'm selling one right now (52:14 - 52:19)
70 bucks but they're also what is called (52:15 - 52:21)
like the quote unquote classic fit and (52:19 - 52:24)
i'm not i'm done buying classic fit (52:21 - 52:25)
stuff i need that slim fit stuff in my (52:24 - 52:27)
life whether that's a t-shirt or a (52:25 - 52:30)
hoodie I just want things that fit a (52:27 - 52:32)
little tighter to my body and classic (52:30 - 52:34)
fit doesn't fit the bill so I want I (52:32 - 52:37)
want more more of that I want like a (52:34 - 52:41)
good hoodie that I can that I can drown (52:37 - 52:45)
myself in tailored hoodies yeah then the (52:41 - 52:48)
painless I'm also gonna say clothing (52:45 - 52:52)
because I'm not I'm not much of a stuff (52:48 - 52:56)
person I don't I don't do a lot like if (52:52 - 52:59)
I get a blush it just kind of sits there (52:56 - 53:04)
I don't do a lot with things but clothes (52:59 - 53:06)
I don't have to have anyway so I mean I (53:04 - 53:08)
had the pocket pikachu too if that is (53:06 - 53:09)
what I was calling this what it was (53:08 - 53:12)
called and it was an incredible device (53:09 - 53:14)
that I spent a lot of time on playing I (53:12 - 53:16)
spent a lot of time playing the double (53:14 - 53:17)
or nothing game that was in there where (53:16 - 53:20)
you would bet wats whether or no I guess (53:17 - 53:22)
it was sort of double or nothing but you (53:20 - 53:24)
would bet wats Double or Nothing whether (53:22 - 53:26)
or not the next card Pikachu would draw (53:24 - 53:28)
from a deck of playing cards would be (53:26 - 53:30)
higher or lower than the previous one (53:28 - 53:32)
you remember a lot of time on that is if (53:30 - 53:34)
that were actually a fun game yeah it's (53:32 - 53:36)
not fun i remember it again but yeah i (53:34 - 53:38)
bet those wats you remember way more (53:36 - 53:40)
about this than I do well there was (53:38 - 53:41)
there is there's a lot of time with it (53:40 - 53:43)
there's pocket p and retelling it is (53:41 - 53:46)
making me even more excited for new ones (53:43 - 53:48)
well there was pocket you which was the (53:46 - 53:50)
the yellow one and then it was pocket I (53:48 - 53:53)
did not have I only had pocket pikachu (53:50 - 53:55)
too yeah there's pocket Pikachu to which (53:53 - 53:57)
worked with the infrared scanner on the (53:55 - 54:01)
game boy color and I had the GS logo yes (53:57 - 54:04)
for going someone yeah I so yeah I would (54:01 - 54:06)
also go in more clothing cuz I wouldn't (54:04 - 54:09)
do anything with a vanilluxe plushie but (54:06 - 54:10)
I'd where'd a phenolic skirt or (54:09 - 54:12)
something you know like I like because (54:10 - 54:14)
I'm gonna have to wear clothes anyway (54:12 - 54:17)
I'm not gonna have to have a blushy with (54:14 - 54:20)
me anyway I'm bad at buying things for (54:17 - 54:21)
myself that I don't (54:20 - 54:26)
need yeah I don't know so yeah and so I (54:21 - 54:27)
can even though i don't need more (54:26 - 54:29)
clothes i can at least justify i can (54:27 - 54:31)
justify the purchase of clothing to (54:29 - 54:33)
myself yeah i mean you could just carry (54:31 - 54:35)
a plush with you every way yeah i was (54:33 - 54:37)
putting bag just pull it out when we be (54:35 - 54:41)
a good look a lot of the stuff on (54:37 - 54:44)
pokemon center com like it's fine and i (54:41 - 54:46)
would probably buy it if it was more (54:44 - 54:49)
tailored to pokemon i like where's like (54:46 - 54:51)
there's no like lotad pin right but i (54:49 - 54:54)
would probably buy a lotad pin and for (54:51 - 54:57)
ya i could maybe see pins my issue with (54:54 - 54:59)
clothing is that like I just don't and (54:57 - 55:02)
Steve knows this better than Travis's (54:59 - 55:04)
but I don't wear things with like (55:02 - 55:07)
graphic stuff on him really eager house (55:04 - 55:09)
really i just never wear clothes I mean (55:07 - 55:11)
I work from home so that's actually (55:09 - 55:15)
pretty true haha uh what I am wearing (55:11 - 55:18)
clothes usually it's I mean I don't wear (55:15 - 55:20)
things that are like really branded I (55:18 - 55:23)
like graphic tees really don't do it for (55:20 - 55:26)
me that much so look having new graphic (55:23 - 55:30)
tees never really excites me it's got to (55:26 - 55:33)
really be something that that is like (55:30 - 55:36)
unique or piques my interest but I don't (55:33 - 55:38)
think I've ever looked at pokemon center (55:36 - 55:40)
com at anything clothing and been like (55:38 - 55:44)
yeah I could wear that well then yeah I (55:40 - 55:45)
guess I should say it has to be like (55:44 - 55:48)
cool and good that's the thing about me (55:45 - 55:49)
and like graphic tees is because I (55:48 - 55:53)
always have a hoodie on so 0 people ever (55:49 - 55:56)
see what is under that hoodie yeah i'm (55:53 - 55:58)
like like i love that Pokemon Center is (55:56 - 56:01)
like still putting out stuff but there's (55:58 - 56:02)
a certain point where you're just like I (56:01 - 56:07)
have no room for these plushies I only (56:02 - 56:11)
have one plush I feel terrible for not (56:07 - 56:12)
having more pleasures or maybe that's (56:11 - 56:14)
good I don't know yeah I think I think (56:12 - 56:15)
we're in reality it's good but if you (56:14 - 56:19)
want to make you posh uni I got one (56:15 - 56:22)
Steven rights in revenue dollars from (56:19 - 56:25)
Alaska my favorite host is travis they (56:22 - 56:27)
are awesome they are an awesome meme (56:25 - 56:30)
Lord also if you guys could fuse to put (56:27 - 56:35)
together who would they be as the ho (56:30 - 56:37)
who would they be hope to hear on here (56:35 - 56:39)
this on the show have a fantastic day (56:37 - 56:42)
Stephen if I could fuse two Pokemon it (56:39 - 56:44)
would be Travis and will create a (56:42 - 56:48)
singularity haha two points funny cuz (56:44 - 56:50)
that's the thing we said before I would (56:48 - 56:56)
today probably I think I mean this has (56:50 - 56:58)
kind of already been done by a lot of (56:56 - 56:59)
people right because there is that meme (56:58 - 57:01)
that I think is really cool speaking of (56:59 - 57:02)
meme Lord my me milord status there's (57:01 - 57:04)
that thing going on those really cool (57:02 - 57:06)
where artist would draw alternate (57:04 - 57:09)
versions of a Pokemon species based on (57:06 - 57:12)
the other Pokemon in its AG group so (57:09 - 57:13)
they would look through like what (57:12 - 57:15)
pokemon that Pokemon could theoretically (57:13 - 57:18)
breed with and then draw depictions of (57:15 - 57:19)
what it would actually look like to have (57:18 - 57:22)
a crossbreed between those two Pokemon (57:19 - 57:24)
artists have been really cool stuff with (57:22 - 57:27)
that and upset that I can't think of (57:24 - 57:30)
anything talking about that' that site (57:27 - 57:33)
where it would like no I'm not talking (57:30 - 57:35)
about them I'm not talking about the (57:33 - 57:37)
joke site Garbutt I mean that thing was (57:35 - 57:40)
very funny and cuz that's what I take (57:37 - 57:43)
screenshot though is that yeah yeah like (57:40 - 57:45)
really good art based off of those (57:43 - 57:46)
people definitely did that and that was (57:45 - 57:49)
really cool and really funny but no i'm (57:46 - 57:50)
talking about it was older than that (57:49 - 57:53)
there is a thing where so like for (57:50 - 57:56)
instance uh let me just pick up a random (57:53 - 57:58)
pokemon so i can give hope a good (57:56 - 58:01)
example yeah sure let me pull up vulpix (57:58 - 58:04)
and see what breeding group it's in so (58:01 - 58:10)
vulpix is in the field AG group so for (58:04 - 58:13)
instance it could breed with a Meowth (58:10 - 58:16)
primate growlithe other pokemon in that (58:13 - 58:19)
group so then the artist would make (58:16 - 58:22)
sketches of the what they would envision (58:19 - 58:25)
a crossbreed between those species would (58:22 - 58:27)
look like if it were like real life (58:25 - 58:30)
where it you know don't keep plus horse (58:27 - 58:32)
makes a mule instead of in pokemon where (58:30 - 58:34)
it just looks identical to whatever the (58:32 - 58:35)
mother is mud brand some pretty cool (58:34 - 58:41)
things with that mmm good job did it uh (58:35 - 58:44)
i guess i would probably want to combine (58:41 - 58:46)
like Sableye with something and ink (58:44 - 58:48)
stabilized really cool so (58:46 - 58:52)
and it may be like you know what Saban a (58:48 - 58:55)
Sableye vanilluxe it's in my mind so (58:52 - 58:56)
let's just do it I feel like you could (58:55 - 58:58)
get away with combining a lot of pokemon (58:56 - 59:01)
with rapidash just because you would (58:58 - 59:05)
have that flame main going on just (59:01 - 59:06)
because rabadash is like really boring (59:05 - 59:08)
and it acts for a really good blank (59:06 - 59:10)
slate about you gonna slap anything else (59:08 - 59:13)
on got him so I would say like rapidash (59:10 - 59:15)
and like Gollum cuz then you would have (59:13 - 59:18)
like a ball of fire like a meteor an (59:15 - 59:21)
asteroid that is cool I'll give you that (59:18 - 59:25)
much I don't know name it name your two (59:21 - 59:29)
favorite Pokemon I mean currently may be (59:25 - 59:31)
queuing gengar so I don't really know (59:29 - 59:33)
what I mean you would have like a mini q (59:31 - 59:37)
really anger alkylation even more (59:33 - 59:41)
ghostly poison even ghosts fairy Tommy (59:37 - 59:44)
Wright's in from Columbus dear IC crew (59:41 - 59:47)
and fan base I am NOT a plant I just (59:44 - 59:52)
like Travis's and djs podcast love Tommy (59:47 - 59:55)
wow I think I might have been like two (59:52 - 59:57)
weeks old but yeah I mean a few weeks (59:55 - 60:00)
ago the person wrote in with an email (59:57 - 60:02)
just saying how good my other podcast (60:00 - 60:04)
arbitrary archive is and I don't (60:02 - 60:06)
necessarily agree i don't think it's (60:04 - 60:09)
that great and then come tommy was (60:06 - 60:12)
accused of being a plant or some sort of (60:09 - 60:16)
shill for the arbitrary archive what are (60:12 - 60:17)
we talking about last week on the show (60:16 - 60:21)
it was um yeah i remember it was good i (60:17 - 60:25)
remember we did a week ago uh uh would (60:21 - 60:27)
you like two more emails here Tyler (60:25 - 60:31)
Wright said hi guys my name is pig menq (60:27 - 60:34)
must be like a twitter / username and (60:31 - 60:36)
I've been listening to you guys for the (60:34 - 60:38)
past year and loving it I was wondering (60:36 - 60:40)
what your guys's favorite episode you've (60:38 - 60:42)
ever done is also my favorite person is (60:40 - 60:45)
SBJ and we'll as we are the same person (60:42 - 60:48)
but when will there be a new mythical (60:45 - 60:52)
hmm so we got like two questions here (60:48 - 60:54)
first one is favorite episode you've (60:52 - 60:57)
done there's their show that stands out (60:54 - 60:59)
to you too I mean is this include (60:57 - 61:01)
mythical because there's a lot of (60:59 - 61:02)
mythical (61:01 - 61:03)
stuff that we've done that I really (61:02 - 61:07)
liked yeah I suppose I could that could (61:03 - 61:10)
extend a mythical then something (61:07 - 61:12)
mythical I can't I don't think I can say (61:10 - 61:15)
it talk about it so that's something I (61:12 - 61:18)
love whenever mythical comes up at from (61:15 - 61:22)
an email writer then everyone bought SBJ (61:18 - 61:23)
just gets a little passive-aggressive (61:22 - 61:26)
about the things that were upset that (61:23 - 61:28)
we're not allowed to talk about yet when (61:26 - 61:30)
mythical and we're like well my favorite (61:28 - 61:31)
thing is the thing that Steve won't let (61:30 - 61:36)
me talk about I mean you you you could (61:31 - 61:39)
say that's your favorite Micah but have (61:36 - 61:43)
you recently like no I got no I guess i (61:39 - 61:45)
guess like that it could be a terrible (61:43 - 61:47)
like as somebody who edits podcast (61:45 - 61:49)
there's I don't know if Travis can (61:47 - 61:51)
relate to that or anyone else but (61:49 - 61:53)
there's that feeling of like when you're (61:51 - 61:55)
going through a podcast you're like yeah (61:53 - 61:56)
this sounds like it's gonna be really (61:55 - 61:59)
good and then when you get when you let (61:56 - 62:00)
it sit for an hour and then you go to (61:59 - 62:01)
edit it and you're going through and (62:00 - 62:04)
you're like I guess this wasn't as funny (62:01 - 62:05)
as i thought it was this like an hour (62:04 - 62:11)
ago I know what you're talking about and (62:05 - 62:13)
I hope you're cutting out like ninety (62:11 - 62:15)
percent of the first like our of that (62:13 - 62:18)
because it's just rolling dice but but (62:15 - 62:19)
in general though like that that that (62:18 - 62:21)
feeling does exist i doona ya like it (62:19 - 62:23)
like even when I finished interviews (62:21 - 62:25)
during the interview could be like yeah (62:23 - 62:27)
this is going great and then you listen (62:25 - 62:29)
to it afterwards and you're like why did (62:27 - 62:34)
I ask such a dumb question I yeah I (62:29 - 62:37)
think a lot of it has to do with that (62:34 - 62:39)
experience it for me is at least like I (62:37 - 62:42)
think I'm saying something really cool (62:39 - 62:44)
or funny and in the moment and then I (62:42 - 62:46)
realized later as i'm editing whatever (62:44 - 62:47)
i'm doing that the joke was like way too (62:46 - 62:49)
in my head or I didn't explain a thing (62:47 - 62:52)
right or I misspoke and that's just (62:49 - 62:54)
generally it's always usually my fault (62:52 - 62:56)
and the realization is like immediately (62:54 - 62:58)
after I say it just like in my normal (62:56 - 63:02)
life i guess i don't know i mean i guess (62:58 - 63:04)
i really liked mostly because of the (63:02 - 63:07)
actual experience that was tied with it (63:04 - 63:09)
but the genka the mythical gencon (63:07 - 63:11)
special was really fun oh yeah yeah that (63:09 - 63:12)
was good recording it and being in the (63:11 - 63:13)
room (63:12 - 63:15)
you know all the excitement surrounding (63:13 - 63:18)
gencon that was good ah probably the fit (63:15 - 63:20)
my favorite thing that I've been on I (63:18 - 63:22)
have a couple episodes I like a lot I (63:20 - 63:25)
really liked the episode with Xavier (63:22 - 63:28)
woods that was also the week that like (63:25 - 63:30)
Pokemon go launch so I just feel like (63:28 - 63:33)
that episode had so much excitement from (63:30 - 63:35)
start to finish and they're like pee (63:33 - 63:37)
back off like what mica said like that (63:35 - 63:39)
episode has just so many like vivid (63:37 - 63:42)
memories for me of like recording it and (63:39 - 63:45)
like I remember the Pokemon go stuff and (63:42 - 63:47)
I remember the look traveling to meet (63:45 - 63:49)
Xavier and I remember like being in his (63:47 - 63:51)
house and recording and then like (63:49 - 63:53)
playing pokemon go for the first time in (63:51 - 63:54)
Atlanta with my friend Alex like that (63:53 - 63:56)
was such a like that whole episode is (63:54 - 64:00)
just very reminiscent of that time for (63:56 - 64:02)
me and then I think another episode that (64:00 - 64:04)
i really liked a lot was the kickstarter (64:02 - 64:06)
episode that we did shout out to alex (64:04 - 64:11)
nasty boys 2017 yeah i think the (64:06 - 64:13)
kickstarter episode was really good i (64:11 - 64:16)
went into that oh episode episode really (64:13 - 64:19)
hoping that there would be debate and (64:16 - 64:22)
frustration as weird as that sounds and (64:19 - 64:24)
there was and i think it was good and it (64:22 - 64:27)
panned out I mean like and went argued (64:24 - 64:30)
for four hours yeah yeah and and that's (64:27 - 64:32)
kind of what I wanted but I pas this (64:30 - 64:34)
podcast would be really boring if all (64:32 - 64:35)
three of us agreed on everything (64:34 - 64:37)
together right so if we were at (64:35 - 64:39)
Kickstarter if we went into that (64:37 - 64:42)
Kickstarter episode all being like okay (64:39 - 64:44)
like sure I get you put me out on why (64:42 - 64:46)
not and instead of like not like instead (64:44 - 64:49)
of instead we talked about that and that (64:46 - 64:51)
got heated at some points and then I (64:49 - 64:55)
think that really translated well to the (64:51 - 64:57)
audience and they responded in in terms (64:55 - 65:00)
and they were very upset about the list (64:57 - 65:01)
too because when it comes down to it (65:00 - 65:03)
everyone has their favorite Pokemon so (65:01 - 65:04)
it was going to be impossible for us to (65:03 - 65:07)
not make a top ten list without people (65:04 - 65:10)
feeling like they got shafted in some (65:07 - 65:12)
way can you do that one we could just (65:10 - 65:14)
have a one-off where the stipulation (65:12 - 65:16)
that you all have to agree on everything (65:14 - 65:20)
you're talking enough that a pan out for (65:16 - 65:25)
being interesting it's hard for me to be (65:20 - 65:26)
able to think of any episode that was (65:25 - 65:27)
cooler to do then (65:26 - 65:30)
the PAX East panel we'd just did I joked (65:27 - 65:32)
the week after about how nervous I was (65:30 - 65:36)
and I certainly was but being able to do (65:32 - 65:39)
our ridiculous jokes about you know like (65:36 - 65:41)
answering the question the ridiculous (65:39 - 65:44)
questions about duck-sized horses and (65:41 - 65:47)
all that and such in front of 100 people (65:44 - 65:50)
I I don't know it was really fun it's (65:47 - 65:53)
cool to be able to hear that you know (65:50 - 65:55)
hear people laugh instantaneously as (65:53 - 65:57)
opposed to wake waiting like two days (65:55 - 65:59)
and then having someone say on twitter (65:57 - 66:02)
that they liked my joke so yeah it was a (65:59 - 66:05)
lot of fun to do that even though I it's (66:02 - 66:08)
already been established that I didn't (66:05 - 66:10)
really like pax itself it took me about (66:08 - 66:11)
a week to listen to that episode I (66:10 - 66:13)
finally last week listen to it and that (66:11 - 66:16)
the energy of the episode was so good (66:13 - 66:19)
Thank very like live episode well paced (66:16 - 66:21)
thanks Lee a live episodes don't really (66:19 - 66:23)
pan out well I think it's like when (66:21 - 66:24)
people download it they realize it's (66:23 - 66:27)
live and I'm guilty of this too for some (66:24 - 66:28)
of the podcast I was into it's just like (66:27 - 66:31)
I don't like the way this audio sounds (66:28 - 66:34)
and so live episodes don't get as many (66:31 - 66:37)
downloads as normal episodes but I am (66:34 - 66:39)
trying to come up with different (66:37 - 66:43)
solutions to make live episodes sound as (66:39 - 66:47)
normal as possible to real episodes we (66:43 - 66:49)
could do is just craft a room that you (66:47 - 66:52)
bring in that's just windows and (66:49 - 66:54)
everybody can watch you from the outside (66:52 - 66:55)
bell and said well that's what the (66:54 - 66:57)
PlayStation view is yeah yeah yeah you (66:55 - 66:59)
take delicious it's a PlayStation (66:57 - 67:02)
podcast that's only live and you not (66:59 - 67:04)
watch them and you can't hear them (67:02 - 67:07)
you're just viewing them fewer we get (67:04 - 67:08)
this question a lot when the middle of a (67:07 - 67:10)
new mythical content all I'm going to (67:08 - 67:14)
say this episode is watch our Twitter at (67:10 - 67:16)
pokemon podcast and there might be (67:14 - 67:18)
something there that gives you an answer (67:16 - 67:21)
and that will probably be every day (67:18 - 67:23)
until that answer is revealed so it's (67:21 - 67:24)
pretty obvious if you follow us on (67:23 - 67:26)
twitter but i would i would stay tuned (67:24 - 67:30)
to watch that and final question will do (67:26 - 67:33)
for the day even though we have a bunch (67:30 - 67:37)
here is from Carla from Brooklyn New (67:33 - 67:39)
York hey Pokemon (67:37 - 67:42)
casters thank you for providing such a (67:39 - 67:45)
quality show week after week I figured (67:42 - 67:47)
out you and other listeners might have (67:45 - 67:48)
some good feedback to the simple (67:47 - 67:50)
question what do you think is the best (67:48 - 67:53)
way to organize a living pokedex my (67:50 - 67:56)
national dex through pokemon bank is (67:53 - 67:58)
almost complete I am only missing (67:56 - 68:01)
dancing and volcanium but it's hard to (67:58 - 68:02)
figure out which Pokemon i still need (68:01 - 68:04)
especially when pc boxes are so cramped (68:02 - 68:07)
pokemon bank does not have that space (68:04 - 68:10)
issue but it also doesn't have an easy (68:07 - 68:12)
way to search for specific Pokemon (68:10 - 68:14)
making it harder to organize I'm sure (68:12 - 68:15)
there's a simple solution but it is (68:14 - 68:18)
annoying when I am just finally when I'm (68:15 - 68:20)
just trying to finally complete a living (68:18 - 68:23)
decks for almost two decades of playing (68:20 - 68:25)
the main game thanks for reading (68:23 - 68:26)
especially if you read on the podcast (68:25 - 68:29)
and I think everyone is great but if I (68:26 - 68:30)
have to pick my favorite it might be (68:29 - 68:33)
Irene thanks again Carla I think by (68:30 - 68:38)
color is the obvious i just recently did (68:33 - 68:41)
this and i can give you some tinder i (68:38 - 68:45)
organized national dex are living i have (68:41 - 68:47)
started my national dex and i have a (68:45 - 68:50)
good chunk of it okay uh what i did was (68:47 - 68:53)
i pulled up a list of all of the pokémon (68:50 - 68:56)
for by number in the national dex and I (68:53 - 69:00)
I grabbed my little journal and I wrote (68:56 - 69:02)
all of them which took a really long (69:00 - 69:05)
time sorry why did you just print the (69:02 - 69:07)
list cuz it's not i don't i don't know (69:05 - 69:10)
way all right you're talking every (69:07 - 69:13)
pokemon i did and i draw a line through (69:10 - 69:16)
them in my journal I keep my journal in (69:13 - 69:18)
my DS with me wherever I'm going or it (69:16 - 69:20)
did when i was still actively doing this (69:18 - 69:23)
and i would draw a line through them as (69:20 - 69:26)
I finished them but in the pokemon bank (69:23 - 69:29)
what I did was the first thing i did was (69:26 - 69:33)
i labeled all of the boxes 0 to 6 30 and (69:29 - 69:36)
31 to 60 at whatever and then so i think (69:33 - 69:38)
the point of confusion here is micah (69:36 - 69:39)
when you say you're gonna give a tip (69:38 - 69:41)
usually you're supposed to be giving (69:39 - 69:44)
good idea it's the best idea it's the (69:41 - 69:47)
only way that if you're the idea of (69:44 - 69:50)
losing the name of the boxes then (69:47 - 69:52)
boxes to the different numbers is (69:50 - 69:54)
actually a good idea yeah that's the (69:52 - 69:56)
easiest way the Writing Center was not (69:54 - 69:59)
extra like no it's really gonna list (69:56 - 70:02)
brother I did it because I like doing it (69:59 - 70:06)
control p on PC commands he on Mac I (70:02 - 70:08)
don't feel accomplished when I do that (70:06 - 70:11)
boo listen I got a journal for a reason (70:08 - 70:14)
okay I want that I want that achievement (70:11 - 70:16)
in my journal it's such a good feeling (70:14 - 70:20)
to just like with a sit down right over (70:16 - 70:23)
a dress ok my name is slide through a (70:20 - 70:26)
name with ease and try right move it for (70:23 - 70:28)
the list scratch everything mica said (70:26 - 70:30)
really though naming your boxes is the (70:28 - 70:33)
best way to do arranged pokemon x color (70:30 - 70:36)
and call it a day or that i agree (70:33 - 70:38)
where's all my blue pokémon these are (70:36 - 70:43)
the garbage way yeah i think actually (70:38 - 70:45)
naming boxes the numbers is a really (70:43 - 70:50)
smart way I have like my boxes are such (70:45 - 70:53)
a mess in bank I have a box of all like (70:50 - 70:56)
event Pokemon which is already full and (70:53 - 70:58)
now i need to make another box of event (70:56 - 71:00)
pokemon and then i have a box of pokemon (70:58 - 71:02)
given to me for competition so when i (71:00 - 71:04)
played black and white competitively i (71:02 - 71:09)
had a bunch of nice folks make me Ivy EV (71:04 - 71:11)
perfect Pokemon so I have them in a (71:09 - 71:13)
separate box like oh these are (71:11 - 71:15)
competition right you really at any time (71:13 - 71:17)
I guess unless the meta changes but I (71:15 - 71:20)
never I didn't have metal Pokemon to (71:17 - 71:23)
begin with and then I have a box of and (71:20 - 71:25)
then I have like a box of a bunch of v's (71:23 - 71:27)
and then I have a box lunch did oohs and (71:25 - 71:28)
then everything else is a mess after (71:27 - 71:30)
that so we're joe game 0 organizing (71:28 - 71:32)
pokemon x color but have you heard of (71:30 - 71:34)
monochromatic tournaments like where you (71:32 - 71:36)
only battle with green pokemon yeah so (71:34 - 71:40)
there's a the all pokemon are actually (71:36 - 71:43)
given a pokedex an official color in the (71:40 - 71:46)
pokédex and like I still have the vole (71:43 - 71:47)
pex page open from when we're using that (71:46 - 71:49)
as an example earlier and vulpix is (71:47 - 71:52)
officially brown and so sometimes people (71:49 - 71:54)
have made just little for fun (71:52 - 71:56)
tournaments where you can choose any (71:54 - 71:59)
color you want but all of the pokemon in (71:56 - 72:02)
it need to have be officially labeled in (71:59 - 72:04)
the pokédex as being (72:02 - 72:06)
the same color at least interesting (72:04 - 72:09)
things were like some colors are better (72:06 - 72:11)
like you like some colors are better (72:09 - 72:14)
suited for different strategies than (72:11 - 72:17)
others just based on what pokemon are (72:14 - 72:19)
purple or whatever so that's something (72:17 - 72:22)
like one yeah we should be really one (72:19 - 72:26)
ascetically pleasing yeah yeah it sounds (72:22 - 72:28)
like a you know magic the gathering a (72:26 - 72:30)

thank you to everyone who does support (74:22 - 74:28)
us speaking of support Travis support us (74:24 - 74:31)
through our pokemon of the week ah man I (74:28 - 74:33)
thought you were like actually gonna do (74:31 - 74:36)
this I was gonna be really impressed by (74:33 - 74:41)
your transition because I thought you're (74:36 - 74:43)
gonna be like support because they're (74:41 - 74:45)
poking on the week is hunched crow and (74:43 - 74:46)
it can learn tailwind which is support (74:45 - 74:49)
move you're like gonna know the things i (74:46 - 74:52)
forgot what second water pokemon of the (74:49 - 74:56)
week was condos Association and actually (74:52 - 74:58)
we get us a mission for both haunch crow (74:56 - 75:01)
and murkrow because as Brandon weisner (74:58 - 75:02)
points out in the Pokemon of the week (75:01 - 75:05)
slack channel neither of these Pokemon (75:02 - 75:07)
are really getting a lot of use but (75:05 - 75:10)
murkrow actually it's marginally more (75:07 - 75:12)
use than does ponch probe because (75:10 - 75:15)
murkrow loses the prankster ability when (75:12 - 75:19)
it volves evolves into hunch crow and (75:15 - 75:21)
prankster is an incredibly powerful (75:19 - 75:24)
ability so these two sets are going to (75:21 - 75:25)
be pretty wildly different from each (75:24 - 75:27)
other because they're doing quite (75:25 - 75:30)
different things so first we'll do the (75:27 - 75:32)
haunch crow set because that is (75:30 - 75:33)
officially the program the week this (75:32 - 75:36)
comes to us from Kevin Soria give me an (75:33 - 75:38)
adamant nature with 250 2 v's and attack (75:36 - 75:42)
and speed for nhp with life orb and (75:38 - 75:47)
moxie the moves are the moves are foul (75:42 - 75:49)
play he's very difficult to transition (75:47 - 75:53)
from our to foul blue anyway the moves (75:49 - 75:56)
our foul play tailwind brave bird and (75:53 - 75:58)
sucker punch Kevin also recommends (75:56 - 76:00)
instead of tailwind you could also run (75:58 - 76:03)
roost or protect kevin says it's pretty (76:00 - 76:06)
basic it's a pretty basic sweeper for (76:03 - 76:08)
the most part you might consider using (76:06 - 76:11)
fly MZ for the item so that you can get (76:08 - 76:14)
the flying z move and then mentions that (76:11 - 76:17)
a tailwind weather set up by the hajj (76:14 - 76:20)
crow itself or by another Pokemon if (76:17 - 76:21)
you're not running tail and on it I (76:20 - 76:23)
would help punch crow a lot this the (76:21 - 76:24)
speed is the thing that's sort of (76:23 - 76:27)
lacking with hunch crow has decent (76:24 - 76:30)
attack stat so it can deal a lot of (76:27 - 76:31)
damage (76:30 - 76:35)
but a quick look at that don't do that (76:31 - 76:37)
this is speed status kind of hindering (76:35 - 76:40)
it before we move on to the murkrow sad (76:37 - 76:41)
I want to throw something out there (76:40 - 76:42)
that's not necessarily good but I (76:41 - 76:44)
thought it was fun when I was messing (76:42 - 76:49)
around with it so a lowland marowak is (76:44 - 76:51)
not as dominant as it was when the (76:49 - 76:53)
people were first messing around with (76:51 - 76:55)
the format I think it's like I'm not (76:53 - 76:56)
sure if it's even in the top ten most (76:55 - 76:58)
used Pokemon right now but there's a (76:56 - 77:00)
point where it definitely was and it was (76:58 - 77:02)
everywhere and I had a I was just (77:00 - 77:04)
messing around with different pokemon (77:02 - 77:07)
and had a sort of gimmicky admittedly (77:04 - 77:10)
team and one of the holes that it it had (77:07 - 77:11)
a hard time dealing with a low and (77:10 - 77:13)
marowak and I wanted something that (77:11 - 77:15)
could just guarantee out speed it and (77:13 - 77:19)
kill it in one hit and strangely enough (77:15 - 77:23)
the the one I decided to try out was was (77:19 - 77:26)
haunch crow with a with the ability (77:23 - 77:31)
super luck and a scope lens because then (77:26 - 77:34)
if you use super Lux Copeland's and (77:31 - 77:37)
night / all three of those so night / (77:34 - 77:40)
has an increased priority scope lens (77:37 - 77:41)
increases the likelihood of critical (77:40 - 77:44)
hits by one or sorry night / has (77:41 - 77:46)
increased critical hit ratio I said (77:44 - 77:48)
increased priority it has increased (77:46 - 77:51)
critical hit ratio scope lens increases (77:48 - 77:53)
the critical hit ratio of all your moves (77:51 - 77:56)
by one and super luck increases the (77:53 - 77:58)
critical hit ratio of all your moves by (77:56 - 78:00)
one so that means night / ends up being (77:58 - 78:02)
a guaranteed critical hit which ended up (78:00 - 78:05)
being a guaranteed one at ko on most of (78:02 - 78:06)
the EV spreads that people were using (78:05 - 78:09)
for marowak it's really gimmicky but it (78:06 - 78:13)
was really fun and it also has the side (78:09 - 78:15)
benefit of you know that having a (78:13 - 78:16)
critical hit is not just good because it (78:15 - 78:18)
gives you more damage but it can also (78:16 - 78:21)
shoot through people who like set up (78:18 - 78:24)
defense increases and stuff like that I (78:21 - 78:26)
should reiterate it wasn't good but it's (78:24 - 78:28)
a funny thing that you can do and then (78:26 - 78:30)
people on pokemon showdown get really (78:28 - 78:32)
angry at you because how did you get (78:30 - 78:34)
three critical hits in a row then you (78:32 - 78:35)
have to explain to them that you did (78:34 - 78:37)
this really inadvisable thing that makes (78:35 - 78:39)
it a one hundred percent chance to do (78:37 - 78:41)
that anyway our last set is going to be (78:39 - 78:45)
for murkrow from brandon weisner this is (78:41 - 78:45)
going to be (78:45 - 78:47)
murkrow with EVO light AV light as an (78:45 - 78:48)
item that increases the defense of (78:47 - 78:50)
special defense of a Pokemon that has (78:48 - 78:52)
the capability to evolve so murkrow (78:50 - 78:54)
account for this the ability as I (78:52 - 78:56)
mentioned before is prankster that's an (78:54 - 78:58)
ability that causes moves that don't (78:56 - 79:00)
deal damage to have increased priority (78:58 - 79:02)
so that they are more likely to go first (79:00 - 79:06)
your EV spread is going to be 252 in HP (79:02 - 79:08)
under 48 and defense and 108 in special (79:06 - 79:12)
defense with a careful nature this is as (79:08 - 79:16)
you can gather from the EV spread and (79:12 - 79:18)
the ability this is more a support (79:16 - 79:21)
oriented set and moves are going to be (79:18 - 79:24)
tailwind foul play squash and taunt (79:21 - 79:26)
taunt and tail wind on are in there (79:24 - 79:27)
because they're just incredible support (79:26 - 79:29)
moves taught for shutting down other (79:27 - 79:31)
Pokemon that are dealing nondamaging (79:29 - 79:34)
moves and then tail went to increase the (79:31 - 79:38)
speed of your team temporarily quash is (79:34 - 79:41)
a really interesting move that you're (79:38 - 79:45)
really you might not know if you don't (79:41 - 79:48)
play a lot of doubles and even then it's (79:45 - 79:52)
it's really only seen on these sort of (79:48 - 79:56)
marginally used like murkrow sets so (79:52 - 79:59)
quash is a dark-type move that makes it (79:56 - 80:03)
so that the target will move last this (79:59 - 80:07)
turn ignoring all like priority so as (80:03 - 80:10)
long as it has enacted already so the (80:07 - 80:11)
reason quash doesn't really see use (80:10 - 80:14)
generally is because if whatever is (80:11 - 80:16)
using a move is going to be faster than (80:14 - 80:20)
you anyway then quash has no effect but (80:16 - 80:23)
because murkuro has prankster you're (80:20 - 80:25)
going to go first with quash unless they (80:23 - 80:27)
use a move with increased priority as (80:25 - 80:30)
well and you can force a Pokemon to move (80:27 - 80:32)
last and then hopefully kill that (80:30 - 80:34)
Pokemon before it's even able to get (80:32 - 80:36)
that move off so you can make a Pokemon (80:34 - 80:37)
that would normally be really fast and (80:36 - 80:39)
be able to KO one in your Pokemon (80:37 - 80:41)
actually the slowest Pokemon in the (80:39 - 80:42)
round and take it out before it's able (80:41 - 80:44)
to act and that can be really cool and (80:42 - 80:46)
then foul play is in there because (80:44 - 80:49)
sometimes you need your support Pokemon (80:46 - 80:51)
to deal damage and foul play is a way to (80:49 - 80:53)
do that without having to invest any in (80:51 - 80:57)
attack because foul play determines its (80:53 - 80:58)
damage by the targets (80:57 - 81:01)
taxed at instead of your own no I think (80:58 - 81:04)
that's that's it yeah well that make (81:01 - 81:08)
sense yes it did your shiny hunch crow (81:04 - 81:12)
will be a bright and pink and that's a (81:08 - 81:13)
really good shine it's really good shiny (81:12 - 81:16)
instead of like the dark blue that it (81:13 - 81:19)
normally is some trivia here ponch crows (81:16 - 81:21)
English name used to be a Japanese word (81:19 - 81:25)
origin word in its name honcho delivered (81:21 - 81:28)
from honcho hard to say that because (81:25 - 81:30)
it's like they're literally the same (81:28 - 81:32)
words while the Japanese name uses the (81:30 - 81:36)
western origin word in its name Don is (81:32 - 81:38)
delivered from the Italian Don or Latin (81:36 - 81:41)
for dominant Adamas both our leader like (81:38 - 81:44)
names and used some and sometimes are (81:41 - 81:48)
used for leaders of shady organizations (81:44 - 81:51)
conch crow comes after mismagius in the (81:48 - 81:53)
sinnoh pokedex but honch crows pre (81:51 - 81:56)
evolution murkrow comes before mismagius (81:53 - 81:59)
is pre evolution misdreavus in the Johto (81:56 - 82:02)
pokedex there you go Hotch Crow is based (81:59 - 82:05)
on a crow or raven with its bulkier more (82:02 - 82:07)
powerful appearance hounds crow looks (82:05 - 82:09)
more much more like a raven than its pre (82:07 - 82:11)
evolution does but its coloration (82:09 - 82:13)
resembles that Ivy hooded crow while (82:11 - 82:16)
murkrow appears to be based on witches (82:13 - 82:18)
of Western folklore haunch crows (82:16 - 82:21)
appearance is reminiscent of a crime (82:18 - 82:24)
boss given a new interpretation to (82:21 - 82:26)
murkrow as a game gang member under (82:24 - 82:30)
hunch crow its crest looks like a wide (82:26 - 82:33)
brimmed fedora hat an article clothing (82:30 - 82:36)
often associated with mom mobsters or (82:33 - 82:40)
neck beards however hansgrohe still (82:36 - 82:43)
actually save it to Justin Hodge gross (82:40 - 82:48)
till does represent fesem broom which (82:43 - 82:50)
has a long connect who has been long (82:48 - 82:52)
connected with witchcraft and its hat (82:50 - 82:54)
and beard like feathers also give the (82:52 - 82:58)
impersonation impression of a sorcerer (82:54 - 83:00)
or wizard people that have listened to (82:58 - 83:02)
the Kickstarter episode know that I (83:00 - 83:05)
really love haunch crow that makes me (83:02 - 83:08)
really nostalgic for playing pokemon (83:05 - 83:10)
with my brother and rolling with the (83:08 - 83:12)
hunch that's so cool (83:10 - 83:15)
ponch grows so cool the big boss Pokemon (83:12 - 83:20)
is hungry Idol that's so cool and good (83:15 - 83:24)
big boss is really good well I think (83:20 - 83:26)
think that wraps up our show for you (83:24 - 83:29)
