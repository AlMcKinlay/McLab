the European Union so they got right in (3:27 - 3:31)

even craving start off this week from an (4:06 - 4:13)
article from Newsweek which not (4:10 - 4:14)
trustworthy (4:13 - 4:15)
apparently is not trustworthy anymore (4:14 - 4:18)
but titled Pokemon sword and shield (4:15 - 4:21)
leaker revealed oh yeah via Nintendo (4:18 - 4:24)
lawsuit hopefully this was the best (4:21 - 4:27)
article here I like to pull articles (4:24 - 4:29)
that have updated that's like a that's (4:27 - 4:31)
like what drags me it's because there's (4:29 - 4:34)
one thing to post news but when you come (4:31 - 4:35)
back and you go oh we got an update on (4:34 - 4:38)
this news I'm all in games I sit there (4:35 - 4:40)
on top of it and they're Google or went (4:38 - 4:42)
off Google Alerts (4:40 - 4:45)
yeah even work anymore sure I think it (4:42 - 4:47)
does I think that's what Joe from peers (4:45 - 4:51)
is like you they have like hot words key (4:47 - 4:52)
words when breaking that's why they're (4:51 - 4:53)
so fascinating (4:52 - 4:55)
okay so if you--if you guys do not (4:53 - 4:57)
recall it's been three months since (4:55 - 4:58)
sword and shield have released before (4:57 - 5:00)
the release of Pokemon sword and shield (4:58 - 5:02)
November information was leaked showing (5:00 - 5:05)
new Pokemon forms and more the flood of (5:02 - 5:08)
unofficial information became so (5:05 - 5:10)
pervasive that Nintendo and the Pokemon (5:08 - 5:12)
company felt it was necessary to file a (5:10 - 5:15)
lawsuit against said leaker or (5:12 - 5:19)
irreparable injury irreparable (5:15 - 5:22)
irreparable is okay irreparable is also (5:19 - 5:27)
okay okay I'm not a lawyer so I don't (5:22 - 5:30)
dumb it down is that they're saying like (5:27 - 5:34)
we're suing you for things that have (5:30 - 5:37)
hurt our reputation is what I uh it's (5:34 - 5:40)
it's not reputation it's just the issues (5:37 - 5:42)
have done damage to me and there's (5:40 - 5:44)
nothing you can ready to reverse that (5:42 - 5:46)
damage so you have to pay a penalty (5:44 - 5:48)
right like there's no weight like (5:46 - 5:52)
there's no way to undo the leaks you did (5:48 - 5:54)
and there's no way to take that (5:52 - 5:57)
knowledge back so you can't repair the (5:54 - 6:00)
situation you guys damaged us in a way (5:57 - 6:02)
that cannot be fixed so somebody out (6:00 - 6:04)
there is going to determine what the (6:02 - 6:06)
financial impact of the leaks were and (6:04 - 6:08)
then you have to pay us that much (6:06 - 6:10)
because that's the financial equivalent (6:08 - 6:13)
of the damage that you caused us Tuesday (6:10 - 6:15)
actually when the article came out so (6:13 - 6:16)
this came out like a week go so this (6:15 - 6:18)
would be last Tuesday Tuesday both (6:16 - 6:21)
companies went to the website to I went (6:18 - 6:23)
to look at the bad people app Tuesday (6:21 - 6:24)
both companies released a joint (6:23 - 6:27)
statement revealing they identified an (6:24 - 6:29)
outlet that broke embargo by posting (6:27 - 6:31)
images and information online leading up (6:29 - 6:35)
to the game's release f Nintendo yeah a (6:31 - 6:42)
Portuguese giving website Nintendo was (6:35 - 6:45)
the identifying outlet and such Nintendo (6:42 - 6:48)
discovered to sever all ties with them (6:45 - 6:52)
so the F in F Nintendo is supposed to (6:48 - 6:54)
stand for forum so it's like a Nintendo (6:52 - 6:57)
forum but I guess now that has a more (6:54 - 6:59)
literal meaning yep it should be noted (6:57 - 7:00)
that the lawsuit was filed against the (6:59 - 7:03)
parties who used the strategy guide to (7:00 - 7:04)
release information and this new (7:03 - 7:06)
development will likely not affect it (7:04 - 7:07)
they have reached out to the Pokemon (7:06 - 7:09)
opening for clarification here's the (7:07 - 7:11)
full statement from Nintendo and the (7:09 - 7:14)
Pokemon company an early in early (7:11 - 7:16)
November so sorry sorry so this is the (7:14 - 7:19)
statement quote in early wait do I have (7:16 - 7:21)
a Nintendo voice no I don't yeah (7:19 - 7:23)
in early November Nintendo identified a (7:21 - 7:26)
number of photographs taken from the (7:23 - 7:28)
gameplay that revealed multiple new and (7:26 - 7:30)
unannounced Pokemon from Pokemon sword (7:28 - 7:32)
and Pokemon shield these photographs (7:30 - 7:33)
have been posted online and Nintendo (7:32 - 7:35)
together with the Pokemon company (7:33 - 7:37)
quickly identified the person (7:35 - 7:38)
responsible for these leaks and (7:37 - 7:41)
immediately took action these Pokemon (7:38 - 7:42)
were released by a reviewer of a (7:41 - 7:44)
Portuguese website named death Nintendo (7:42 - 7:46)
who had received an early copy of the (7:44 - 7:48)
game for review purposes both he and F (7:46 - 7:50)
Nintendo failed to handle confidential (7:48 - 7:52)
matter resulting in a clear breach of (7:50 - 7:54)
confidentiality agreement between (7:52 - 7:57)
Nintendo and a media outlet as a result (7:54 - 7:59)
in attend alonger work with F Nintendo (7:57 - 8:01)
Nintendo will always protect its (7:59 - 8:04)
intellectual properties and brands leaks (8:01 - 8:06)
hurt not Nintendo but thousands of (8:04 - 8:07)
employees who work hard to bring these (8:06 - 8:09)
games to market and millions of fans (8:07 - 8:10)
around the world who look forward to (8:09 - 8:13)
news and surprises to surprise and (8:10 - 8:14)
delight players throughout news (8:13 - 8:16)
experience is a shared passion for (8:14 - 8:18)
Nintendo and the Pokemon company we will (8:16 - 8:20)
always pursue all avenues preserve (8:18 - 8:23)
surprises for players of future Pokemon (8:20 - 8:26)
titles so f Nintendo posted a statement (8:23 - 8:29)
on the matter and they said to our (8:26 - 8:32)
readers in early November of 2019 a (8:29 - 8:34)
series of photographs of screens (8:32 - 8:36)
displaying images of several Pokemon at (8:34 - 8:38)
the time not yet announced from Pokemon (8:36 - 8:40)
sword and shield games were shared (8:38 - 8:43)
online we take the opportunity to openly (8:40 - 8:44)
admit to our readers that F Nintendo was (8:43 - 8:48)
responsible for the online discernment (8:44 - 8:51)
ation of these photos boy I hope I said (8:48 - 8:52)
that right the first time (8:51 - 8:54)
dissemination there was no R in there (8:52 - 8:57)
this is summation dissemination Nintendo (8:54 - 9:00)
offered us a copy of the game for (8:57 - 9:02)
analyst purpose with clear embargo (9:00 - 9:04)
guidelines which we agreed that copy was (9:02 - 9:06)
sent to one of our collaborators who (9:04 - 9:09)
improperly shared photos mentioned after (9:06 - 9:11)
the investigation F M Tendo ended its (9:09 - 9:13)
relationship with that employee our (9:11 - 9:15)
relationship with Nintendo Portugal goes (9:13 - 9:19)
back 11 years but our part in this undo (9:15 - 9:21)
sharing is clear violation (9:19 - 9:23)
the confidential agreement between us (9:21 - 9:26)
and as a result a total breach of trust (9:23 - 9:27)
with Nintendo (9:26 - 9:30)
we recognize that it's inadmissible to (9:27 - 9:33)
violate the embargo guidelines and that (9:30 - 9:35)
we have not handled the materials for (9:33 - 9:37)
analysis with due care we fully respect (9:35 - 9:38)
Nintendo's decision to cancel the (9:37 - 9:41)
confidential confidential agreement (9:38 - 9:43)
between our companies as a result of (9:41 - 9:45)
this breach of trust and we accept that (9:43 - 9:47)
we will no longer receive nintendo (9:45 - 9:49)
products or be invited to participate in (9:47 - 9:53)
events that monka we apologize to (9:49 - 9:54)
Nintendo and the Li Pokemon company as (9:53 - 9:56)
well as our readers for disappointing (9:54 - 10:01)
them and in fire months F Nintendo will (9:56 - 10:04)
be shutting down yeah when you're who I (10:01 - 10:06)
I don't know too much about F no Tendo (10:04 - 10:08)
their actual website was down the day (10:06 - 10:11)
this broke just because so many people (10:08 - 10:13)
were trying to like go to their website (10:11 - 10:16)
and see when you're when you're the main (10:13 - 10:18)
gist of your website is to focus on (10:16 - 10:21)
nintendo stuff and you had an eleven (10:18 - 10:23)
year partnership with nintendo (10:21 - 10:27)
full disclosure to our listeners i have (10:23 - 10:28)
a partnership with Nintendo (10:27 - 10:30)
they only send me games here and there (10:28 - 10:34)
it's not it's not probably anything the (10:30 - 10:38)
extent of like a giant bomb or a game (10:34 - 10:40)
informer or Eurogamer but I mean they (10:38 - 10:42)
can still review games they can still (10:40 - 10:44)
give their inputs they just don't they (10:42 - 10:45)
just won't be able to you know get (10:44 - 10:48)
things early or get things compensated (10:45 - 10:50)
by Nintendo as well as going to advance (10:48 - 10:53)
which I mean they're gonna be behind ya (10:50 - 10:56)
constantly like this is what ultimately (10:53 - 10:59)
kills a website I mean if you can't be (10:56 - 11:02)
on top of it either your content has to (10:59 - 11:04)
be brilliant and from what I understand (11:02 - 11:08)
the content and portugal is lacking (11:04 - 11:10)
almost completely like they were one of (11:08 - 11:12)
the only sites and now they're cut out (11:10 - 11:15)
from it so i i'm assuming they're just (11:12 - 11:20)
done like this was AB male in the coffin (11:15 - 11:22)
yeah they're coming back from there (11:20 - 11:24)
because Portuguese speakers can go to (11:22 - 11:27)
Brazilian sites for their Nintendo news (11:24 - 11:31)
yeah I'm not sure how big they were they (11:27 - 11:34)
they had about 500 followers on Twitter (11:31 - 11:35)
about (11:34 - 11:39)
500 Facebook Likes if that's how you (11:35 - 11:42)
measure our website probably not but it (11:39 - 11:45)
would make sense for if if that was the (11:42 - 11:48)
biggest you know Portugal website it (11:45 - 11:49)
would make sense for a Nintendo to be (11:48 - 11:52)
like okay well we we've still respect (11:49 - 11:53)
and we still want to do something for (11:52 - 11:57)
our Portugal audience so let's work with (11:53 - 11:59)
this website and if they've been working (11:57 - 12:00)
with that website for 11 years it (11:59 - 12:02)
wouldn't make sense to break off that (12:00 - 12:04)
tie if the relationships were always (12:02 - 12:06)
good if the relationship between them (12:04 - 12:08)
were always good now it's not for the (12:06 - 12:11)
record and it send to Portugal the (12:08 - 12:13)
official Nintendo Portuguese Twitter has (12:11 - 12:17)
15,000 followers so very tiny but again (12:13 - 12:20)
not to say that audience isn't still (12:17 - 12:22)
important to Nintendo I guess case (12:20 - 12:24)
closed I know they said we acted as (12:22 - 12:27)
quickly as possible it was it took three (12:24 - 12:30)
months but all legal matter is that's (12:27 - 12:33)
three months pad yes three months for (12:30 - 12:36)
legal stuff is actually really fast (12:33 - 12:39)
let's move over since we're in lawsuit (12:36 - 12:46)
town let's move over to the antic here I (12:39 - 12:48)
first saw this on the Silk Road that (12:46 - 12:50)
people were complaining that knee antic (12:48 - 12:53)
said that tickets were I think 18 pounds (12:50 - 12:56)
18 euros I'm not sure which one it is (12:53 - 13:00)
well that is an important thing yeah (12:56 - 13:03)
they're different again so I first saw (13:00 - 13:05)
myself Road they were saying that the a (13:03 - 13:07)

Pokemon go safaris an event ok (13:45 - 13:50)
so let's let's jump let's jump down to (13:48 - 13:52)
the original story here this was at (13:50 - 13:54)
10:30 a.m. on Valentine's Day Pokemon go (13:52 - 13:57)
fans found their tickets to the UK's (13:54 - 13:59)
first Safari Zone to cost more than (13:57 - 14:01)
expected due to the addition of (13:59 - 14:03)
previously unmentioned tax and fees (14:01 - 14:06)
before checkout liverpool safari zone (14:03 - 14:08)
tickets went on sale at 8 a.m. UK time (14:06 - 14:11)
up until the ticket buying process they (14:08 - 14:15)
were listed for either 12 pounds I think (14:11 - 14:17)
it's pounds cuz it's the like if it (14:15 - 14:19)
looks like an L with the line through it (14:17 - 14:21)
that's a pound yes okay yep twelve (14:19 - 14:24)
pounds per standard ticket or 18 pounds (14:21 - 14:27)
for early access this price is also (14:24 - 14:30)
advertised by nanny antic in its blog (14:27 - 14:33)
post of announcing the event and the (14:30 - 14:35)
in-game news post which does not mention (14:33 - 14:39)
any taxes or fees but reaching the later (14:35 - 14:42)
stages of the tickets in the selection (14:39 - 14:46)
process a three-pound / 4.20 pound (14:42 - 14:51)
charge for tax and a further $3.00 a (14:46 - 14:54)
three pound flat charge for fees then (14:51 - 14:57)
applied this makes the 12 pound standard (14:54 - 15:00)
ticket jump to 18 pounds and the 18 (14:57 - 15:03)
pound early access ticket actually cost (15:00 - 15:06)
25.20 pounds that's all without the (15:03 - 15:08)
additional city explorer pass which (15:06 - 15:11)
bumps the tax category even higher the (15:08 - 15:13)
4.6 pounds a stainer ticket and 5.8 (15:11 - 15:18)
pounds or 1 with early access now fans (15:13 - 15:20)
have said they are contacting the UK's (15:18 - 15:23)
Advertising Standards Authority the a sa (15:20 - 15:24)
to state that any antics should have (15:23 - 15:26)
disclosed that they need to pay tax on (15:24 - 15:28)
top of the ticket prices listed this is (15:26 - 15:30)
not the case for the u.s. wearing antic (15:28 - 15:32)
is based but in the UK the si si (15:30 - 15:36)
guidelines on this appear Perce clears (15:32 - 15:39)
exactly rule point three one eight of (15:36 - 15:42)
the CA P code states that quote prices (15:39 - 15:45)
must include non optional taxes duties (15:42 - 15:48)
and fees that charges and charges that (15:45 - 15:52)
apply to most to all or most buyers and (15:48 - 15:55)
quote with the only exception would be (15:52 - 15:57)
for cost of taxpayers who would normally (15:55 - 16:00)
recover v VAT or to those who pay none (15:57 - 16:02)
in the first place neither cat (16:00 - 16:05)
applies to most ticket buyers your gamer (16:02 - 16:07)
has contacted me in the antic and the (16:05 - 16:10)
aasa' we wait for the response (16:07 - 16:15)
fast-forward six hours later moving (16:10 - 16:18)
really fast here the UK advertising (16:15 - 16:20)
standard Authority the a si has (16:18 - 16:22)
confirmed a Eurogamer so far that it (16:20 - 16:24)
received more than 180 complaints about (16:22 - 16:26)
Pokemon goes Liverpool event pricing (16:24 - 16:28)
since the tickets went on sale at 8 a.m. (16:26 - 16:30)
this morning as reported this morning (16:28 - 16:32)
below developer Niantic advertised (16:30 - 16:35)
ticket prices do not include taxes and (16:32 - 16:37)
fees which fans were surprised to find (16:35 - 16:39)
out before they added a check out it (16:37 - 16:41)
doesn't say here in the article but I'm (16:39 - 16:43)
sure all those fans continued to (16:41 - 16:45)
purchase their tickets even though they (16:43 - 16:48)
were upset about the false advertising (16:45 - 16:50)
as we know Pokemon go fans (16:48 - 16:55)
they'll pay $30 for incubators just (16:50 - 16:58)
hopefully hatched one shiny riolu in a (16:55 - 17:00)
statement to Eurogamer the aasa' branded (16:58 - 17:02)
knee antics advertising as misleading (17:00 - 17:05)
and confirmed it's now in contact with (17:02 - 17:07)
the developer quotes we are in the (17:05 - 17:09)
process of contacting the advertiser so (17:07 - 17:11)
we can instruct them to amend their (17:09 - 17:13)
misleading advertisement your gamer has (17:11 - 17:15)
yet to hear back from the antic three (17:13 - 17:19)
hours later Wow knee antic has now (17:15 - 17:21)
updated their ticket pricing for (17:19 - 17:22)
Liverpool's (17:21 - 17:24)
safari zone event quote previous (17:22 - 17:26)
advertising for Pokemon goes safari zone (17:24 - 17:28)
Liverpool tickets did not include the (17:26 - 17:30)
service fees in fact costs in the antic (17:28 - 17:33)
spokesperson told Eurogamer this evening (17:30 - 17:35)
we are updating all the listings today (17:33 - 17:38)
quote the ticket price is now listed as (17:35 - 17:40)
twenty one point six pounds for early (17:38 - 17:42)
access and fourteen point four pounds (17:40 - 17:44)
for general admission a 3.6 pounds (17:42 - 17:46)
service fee has been added to each order (17:44 - 17:49)
up to four per ticket the Exedy Explorer (17:46 - 17:52)
pass add-on is nine point six pounds and (17:49 - 17:55)
all prices are inclusive of that on (17:52 - 17:57)
Twitter antics support account (17:55 - 18:00)
apologized or described a apologize (17:57 - 18:03)
describing the situation as an error I (18:00 - 18:05)
don't know if there's like an a s a (18:03 - 18:07)
penalty I don't know if like Nanta has (18:05 - 18:10)
to pay like a fine for I'm sure they do (18:07 - 18:11)
but it's probably a drop in the bucket (18:10 - 18:14)
when you're making two million dollars a (18:11 - 18:16)
day right it's like (18:14 - 18:19)
probably say like oh you it's $100,000 (18:16 - 18:22)
fine or whatever and they'll be like (18:19 - 18:27)
okay here ever $100,000 dollar pound (18:22 - 18:29)
euro whatever fine that's like one hour (18:27 - 18:30)
of a lucky tongue event a hundred (18:29 - 18:34)
thousand that's gonna be like not a lot (18:30 - 18:37)
it's why a lot of companies do these (18:34 - 18:40)
things because the penalties are nothing (18:37 - 18:40)
to them (18:40 - 18:45)
penalties aside is it is it smarter for (18:40 - 18:47)
them to advertise a lower price when (18:45 - 18:50)
they know they're like fan base is gonna (18:47 - 18:52)
buy tickets I mean no matter how many (18:50 - 18:54)
that that thing that in this case I (18:52 - 18:56)
would believe that they just made a (18:54 - 19:00)
mistake oh this is 100% like a clerical (18:56 - 19:02)
slash we didn't understand that that was (19:00 - 19:06)
the law over there error because in the (19:02 - 19:08)
United States uh nobody has to tell us (19:06 - 19:10)
service charges taxes up front we just (19:08 - 19:14)
expect them Ticketmaster correct we've (19:10 - 19:17)
been trained over years and years of (19:14 - 19:19)
Ticketmaster yeah Ticketmaster is not (19:17 - 19:21)
great is it they're only like isn't (19:19 - 19:24)
they're only like two ticket places in (19:21 - 19:25)
the unites it's like taking master on a (19:24 - 19:28)
live nation it depends on how you define (19:25 - 19:31)
ticket yeah I guess I mean because you (19:28 - 19:33)
can sell tickets through Eventbrite oh (19:31 - 19:38)
yeah I had to help I read by BTS tickets (19:33 - 19:40)
and that was the first time I've used (19:38 - 19:43)
Ticketmaster in like six or seven years (19:40 - 19:48)
it's rough it's pain it is rough I have (19:43 - 19:50)
so much more respect for Niantic for (19:48 - 19:53)
doing the lottery system because even if (19:50 - 19:55)
you're sitting there for like four hours (19:53 - 19:56)
waiting for Ticketmaster to open its (19:55 - 19:58)
queue and it's like telling you not to (19:56 - 20:02)
refresh it's like still a lottery like (19:58 - 20:04)
it's am I going to connect before the (20:02 - 20:05)
other a million people trying to order (20:04 - 20:08)
these tickets like just give me a (20:05 - 20:10)
lottery say that like you won the (20:08 - 20:12)
lottery your time to buy is between 3:00 (20:10 - 20:14)
and 4:00 p.m. there's only a hundred (20:12 - 20:16)
other people that will be buying so the (20:14 - 20:17)
server's aren't going to be slammed (20:16 - 20:19)
here's your secret code to get in listen (20:17 - 20:24)
millennial back in my day free internet (20:19 - 20:26)
if you wanted to get tickets that were (20:24 - 20:29)
sold by Ticketmaster you had to know (20:26 - 20:30)
which (20:29 - 20:32)
doors were the Ticketmaster outlets and (20:30 - 20:37)
arbitrarily lined up in the cold hours (20:32 - 20:41)
before the store opened hoping because (20:37 - 20:44)
once again no lottery that you were in (20:41 - 20:46)
line in your store went fast enough that (20:44 - 20:49)
you could get tickets yep that's how it (20:46 - 20:51)
that's how I got second row for Tori (20:49 - 20:53)

Ticketmaster location we got there two (20:55 - 21:01)
hours ahead of their opening we were the (20:58 - 21:03)
third person in line and the two people (21:01 - 21:06)
in front of us wanted different concerts (21:03 - 21:11)
didn't want Tori Amos no no go work it (21:06 - 21:12)
is what it is (21:11 - 21:16)
Mantic apologized and I'm sure holidays (21:12 - 21:19)
pay your slap on the wrist fee three bar (21:16 - 21:23)
do it again no one will remember no one (21:19 - 21:25)
the internet will remember believe me (21:23 - 21:27)
the next time an event comes up it'll be (21:25 - 21:29)
the antic didn't tell Japan about (21:27 - 21:32)
service cherry I'm sure all right is (21:29 - 21:36)
this are the GPO boys going to going to (21:32 - 21:40)

use it transferring was incredibly easy (31:45 - 31:51)
well so let me ask you my first question (31:48 - 31:56)
I when I saw that people started having (31:51 - 31:58)
access to it I went to the App Store on (31:56 - 32:00)
my iPhone and typed Pokemon home and (31:58 - 32:04)
nothing came up what was I doing wrong (32:00 - 32:07)
nothing nothing um so that this has (32:04 - 32:09)
nothing to do with Game Freak or (32:07 - 32:11)
Nintendo it just has to do with how the (32:09 - 32:15)
App Store has to index actual search (32:11 - 32:18)
results on your devices and how there's (32:15 - 32:20)
like a slow rollout of apps for people (32:18 - 32:23)
so sometimes somebody can get an update (32:20 - 32:25)
to an app before somebody else gets an (32:23 - 32:27)
update because they don't push it to all (32:25 - 32:30)
devices at once they push it in in (32:27 - 32:33)
groups so what's the wait just other (32:30 - 32:35)
people was in other people's app stores (32:33 - 32:38)
before it was in my App Store yes yes (32:35 - 32:40)
there is a trick there is a trick to (32:38 - 32:44)
this for anyone who ever wants to find (32:40 - 32:46)
an app early so for example if somebody (32:44 - 32:47)
is like hey Pokemon I'll just use (32:46 - 32:49)
Pokemon apps for example if somebody (32:47 - 32:51)
says hey Pokemon go has an update and (32:49 - 32:53)
you check the update tab and there's no (32:51 - 32:55)
update it's probably because your device (32:53 - 32:57)
hasn't indexed that yet but if you were (32:55 - 32:59)
to like search for Pokemon go and go to (32:57 - 33:02)
the actual app you'll probably see the (32:59 - 33:05)
update button there because it is posted (33:02 - 33:06)
it's just that your device hasn't (33:05 - 33:09)
received that yep that's an update that (33:06 - 33:11)
a software title I needed the software (33:09 - 33:14)
title so when new software gets added (33:11 - 33:16)
what you can do is if you know the (33:14 - 33:19)
developers name because again it's so (33:16 - 33:21)
the app is there it's just the search (33:19 - 33:23)
engine the search engine in your app (33:21 - 33:25)
store has an indexed it yet so what I (33:23 - 33:27)
was telling people to do is if you (33:25 - 33:29)
search for Magikarp jump (33:27 - 33:31)
which is indexed and you click on (33:29 - 33:33)
Magikarp jump and then you click on the (33:31 - 33:35)
developer which is the Pokemon company (33:33 - 33:36)
international you can see all the apps (33:35 - 33:38)
that they've published and one of them (33:36 - 33:40)
was Pokemon home so you was you were (33:38 - 33:44)
able to get it before your search engine (33:40 - 33:46)
indexed it so that was how people were (33:44 - 33:47)
getting it a little bit quicker than (33:46 - 33:50)
other people well hi there way left a (33:47 - 33:53)
bad taste in my mouth (33:50 - 33:53)
classic well did you did you use it (33:54 - 33:59)
we'll have you downloaded it did you pay (33:57 - 34:04)
the $60 okay I have downloaded it both (33:59 - 34:06)
to my phone after Gregg so kindly sent (34:04 - 34:09)
me the link to the application I (34:06 - 34:11)
downloaded onto my switch I have paid (34:09 - 34:16)
the 16 dollars I spent probably 10 (34:11 - 34:18)
minutes on my switch looking for where I (34:16 - 34:21)
could do friend codes because I kept (34:18 - 34:22)
getting friend codes from all these (34:21 - 34:25)
other people couldn't find them got (34:22 - 34:29)
frustrated stopped for a while realized (34:25 - 34:30)
that you could only do the friend codes (34:29 - 34:33)
on the phone yup because that's stupid (34:30 - 34:38)
and so and I sent out a few friend codes (34:33 - 34:41)
to people and they said are you having a (34:38 - 34:43)
seizure why are you typing all these (34:41 - 34:44)
letters because it doesn't give you any (34:43 - 34:47)
other information other than blurt (34:44 - 34:49)
here's a bunch of letters (34:47 - 34:52)
and (34:49 - 34:52)
this is where it ends I went on my (34:52 - 35:01)
switch and I said I'm going to connect (34:57 - 35:06)
to Pokemon bank I'm gonna select which (35:01 - 35:09)
of my Pokemon and Pokemon bank I'm gonna (35:06 - 35:12)
upload because I'm like this this is (35:09 - 35:15)
Will Anderson SWAT process I was like it (35:12 - 35:18)
knows who I am obviously there's a whole (35:15 - 35:20)
part of the switch that says here's your (35:18 - 35:23)
friends from your 3ds so make them your (35:20 - 35:25)
friends on your switch so it's like it (35:23 - 35:30)
knows who I am so then I go in and and (35:25 - 35:34)
it's like get the move key from the bank (35:30 - 35:37)
to say to connect in the move with the (35:34 - 35:40)
things and then I'm like okay okay then (35:37 - 35:42)
they went to my 3ds and I open Pokemon (35:40 - 35:44)
back it's like you've got a software (35:42 - 35:46)
update that's gonna take about 45 (35:44 - 35:48)
minutes to download and install and I (35:46 - 35:50)
was like whatever you know what I'll (35:48 - 35:52)
just do a living Dex and Pokemon sword (35:50 - 35:54)
and shield and eventually I'll get back (35:52 - 35:57)
around to this where I am right now (35:54 - 36:00)
actually that's conversation heaven with (35:57 - 36:08)
you they just hurdle after hurdle after (36:00 - 36:10)
hurdle in my way (36:08 - 36:13)
I mean today I can't be easy to be fair (36:10 - 36:16)
I'm sure if you were to like update your (36:13 - 36:18)
Pokemon transport or your Pokemon bank (36:16 - 36:20)
right now if it would probably be (36:18 - 36:23)
instantaneous because not a million (36:20 - 36:25)
people are trying to do it on the day (36:23 - 36:28)
that they released it all so I turned it (36:25 - 36:32)
on on the switch and some freaky looking (36:28 - 36:35)
hippie and with future like the guy is (36:32 - 36:37)
like the doctor from Back to the Future (36:35 - 36:38)
who I thought was the weakest part of (36:37 - 36:43)
that entire movie sunglasses on assaults (36:38 - 36:45)
me and then it leaves me in the hands of (36:43 - 36:48)
pokeball boy whatever his name is (36:45 - 36:51)
pokey boy here's the secret of pokey boy (36:48 - 36:53)
he gives you all the information about (36:51 - 36:55)
the things that you don't need (36:53 - 36:57)
information and it gives you no (36:55 - 37:00)
information about the things that you do (36:57 - 37:02)
need information about that is accurate (37:00 - 37:05)
pokey boy is definitely designed by (37:02 - 37:06)
James Turner right (37:05 - 37:09)
like if you ever follow far sure James (37:06 - 37:11)
Turner on Instagram or Twitter it is a (37:09 - 37:14)
million percent his his style (37:11 - 37:16)
I think the Professor Oak is called (37:14 - 37:20)
Grand Oak is that correct and oak yeah (37:16 - 37:22)
which is which is really calls into (37:20 - 37:26)
question where he fits in the oak family (37:22 - 37:28)
tree there's actually like a kind of a I (37:26 - 37:30)
can maybe answer that question for you (37:28 - 37:33)
are you are you are you saying that you (37:30 - 37:37)
are not happy with with Pokemon um well (37:33 - 37:41)
I can't tell yet cuz I really haven't (37:37 - 37:43)
been able to use it sounds like you have (37:41 - 37:48)
some complaints I do oh and also talking (37:43 - 37:49)
to Greg scared me off the whole thing (37:48 - 37:51)
Greg convinced I was sat there for (37:49 - 37:53)
fifteen minutes as they screamed at me (37:51 - 37:55)
about how awful it was I was like oh no (37:53 - 37:58)
I'm really not touching this they made a (37:55 - 38:05)
lot of weird choices that I was like why (37:58 - 38:08)
why are you doing this why why did you (38:05 - 38:11)
do it this way like the mobile version (38:08 - 38:14)
has the Pokemon goal box interface which (38:11 - 38:18)
I absolutely hate Pokemon box whoo and (38:14 - 38:20)
go it doesn't have no boxes correct oh (38:18 - 38:24)
you don't like that there's boxes I why (38:20 - 38:26)
I like that there's boxes I like knowing (38:24 - 38:27)
where I put things when they go into (38:26 - 38:30)
home is just a giant list of everything (38:27 - 38:33)
that I've put in whatever order is (38:30 - 38:35)
decided the fact that there are labels (38:33 - 38:38)
that it auto creates for itself that the (38:35 - 38:41)
game doesn't tell you hey these are (38:38 - 38:42)
labels that you can work and use with (38:41 - 38:44)
and what they do they're just hidden (38:42 - 38:46)
here yeah the label stuff once you (38:44 - 38:48)
discover the label stuff it's it's it's (38:46 - 38:51)
awesome but they but they don't do (38:48 - 38:53)
anything to tell you about it don't (38:51 - 38:57)
worry of it like pokey boy is just a boy (38:53 - 38:57)
weenie pokeyman pokeyman how how to (38:58 - 39:06)
actually make a usable product that is (39:03 - 39:10)
fun and human okay it's easy rant it is (39:06 - 39:11)
easy to figure out labels on your own (39:10 - 39:13)
and once you figure out labels you're (39:11 - 39:15)
like this is a better system than what (39:13 - 39:18)
Pokemon bank had if you get there yeah (39:15 - 39:20)
it's not easy to get there (39:18 - 39:22)
and like there isn't there is nothing (39:20 - 39:24)
except for a challenge that says hey (39:22 - 39:26)
you've created a label I'm like I did (39:24 - 39:30)
where where is this label I created and (39:26 - 39:33)
if I click on the challenge it don't (39:30 - 39:35)
tell me where that is or what it what it (39:33 - 39:38)
is or where to find it I have to not (39:35 - 39:41)
only do you have to find it yourself but (39:38 - 39:43)
you have to have pressed on the right (39:41 - 39:46)
area for three seconds or longer for it (39:43 - 39:49)
to launch there are so many maddening (39:46 - 39:52)
things that they've just put in the way (39:49 - 39:55)
of making their ease of use functions (39:52 - 40:00)
actually easy to use as then look pretty (39:55 - 40:03)
boy spoke a boy had one job he failed he (40:00 - 40:08)
failed F and correct me if I'm wrong but (40:03 - 40:11)
a friend trade is only local haven't (40:08 - 40:13)
tried trading so I don't know (40:11 - 40:14)
I have only gotten it to work locally (40:13 - 40:16)
and I don't know if that's a server (40:14 - 40:19)
issue or if that's just the way it works (40:16 - 40:22)
which makes friend codes and friend (40:19 - 40:25)
trading useless and since they didn't (40:22 - 40:29)
put any additional blocks or any sort of (40:25 - 40:32)
additional filters on the GTS or wonder (40:29 - 40:35)
boxing well those are essentially as (40:32 - 40:40)
useless as they always have been GTS is (40:35 - 40:42)
always pretty useless like unless you (40:40 - 40:44)
were like I really just nice in a / ugly (40:42 - 40:47)
can somebody out there willing to trade (40:44 - 40:49)
apparently oh you want Mewtwo for / ugly (40:47 - 40:50)
all right well eventually I'll find (40:49 - 40:52)
somebody who's wanting like a Bellsprout (40:50 - 40:54)
for ugly all right done got the pearly (40:52 - 40:56)
that's like the best that GTS can offer (40:54 - 40:58)
you because otherwise it's like I'm (40:56 - 41:03)
looking for new crows MA but I'm only (40:58 - 41:07)
willing to trade weepin yeah I mean (41:03 - 41:10)
there are some bad trades on GTS well I (41:07 - 41:12)
know but GTS is like terribly broken (41:10 - 41:14)
right now because you can't trade so I (41:12 - 41:15)
don't know if this is intentional but (41:14 - 41:16)
you can't trade mythical Pokemon B of (41:15 - 41:19)
the GTRs so like melt an Mel medal like (41:16 - 41:20)
Cal do your you can't trade those (41:19 - 41:23)
Pokemon but when you do the the (41:20 - 41:25)
legendary mythical filter Pokemon that (41:23 - 41:28)
are still legendary like taboo cocoa (41:25 - 41:30)
taboo Leela a type null sieve allied (41:28 - 41:33)
they still appear (41:30 - 41:35)
in the results even if you have that (41:33 - 41:38)
filter off so I don't know what happened (41:35 - 41:40)
there but everything in regards to the (41:38 - 41:44)
GTS we can we could spend 20 minutes (41:40 - 41:45)
talking about how it's broken out how it (41:44 - 41:47)
doesn't work or we can just say (41:45 - 41:50)
currently as of this podcast it's broken (41:47 - 41:52)
and it doesn't work correct (41:50 - 41:54)
but so that's my thing right like at (41:52 - 41:56)
this point the one thing that does work (41:54 - 41:59)
is is an expanded Bank on the switch (41:56 - 42:02)
that's the part that works that ain't (41:59 - 42:05)
worth 16 bucks I can't say in good faith (42:02 - 42:07)
that all the other features that it was (42:05 - 42:08)
supposed to bring and I'm disappointed (42:07 - 42:12)
that it brought nothing more than what (42:08 - 42:13)
was on their website there's nothing (42:12 - 42:14)
hidden (42:13 - 42:16)
there's nothing additional it is exactly (42:14 - 42:18)
what's offered and what's offered is (42:16 - 42:21)
poorly implemented that's not worth $16 (42:18 - 42:25)
to me maybe in the future but right now (42:21 - 42:29)
nah you needed to go lower if you were (42:25 - 42:31)
gonna have this many problems at the (42:29 - 42:33)
start but things that just didn't work (42:31 - 42:35)
hold on it's only been like it's not (42:33 - 42:38)
even been a week no true has not even (42:35 - 42:40)
been a full week and I would assume that (42:38 - 42:42)
the GTS part is the hardest part I get (42:40 - 42:46)
right what happens when we assume no no (42:42 - 42:48)
that's fine I'm sure okay so there's a (42:46 - 42:49)
couple of things that I think are really (42:48 - 42:53)
important here but stupid program I know (42:49 - 42:55)
but I think that's the hardest thing to (42:53 - 42:57)
get right because of how many people (42:55 - 42:59)
will be putting things on and off that (42:57 - 43:01)
you can put up to 10 things on the GTS (42:59 - 43:03)
if you're paying right the GTS is (43:01 - 43:07)
existed for 10 years now what how long (43:03 - 43:10)
do they need to get it right it's been (43:07 - 43:17)
10 years I agree the GTS is hot garbage (43:10 - 43:20)
they know what's legal they would know (43:17 - 43:25)
that a level-one Venusaur (43:20 - 43:28)
isn't a thing that can be asked for like (43:25 - 43:34)
uh you know a male Salah so the system (43:28 - 43:36)
at this point ten years into this (43:34 - 43:38)
process should not allow a person to (43:36 - 43:41)
select that yeah it should be able to (43:38 - 43:44)
say hey that is not a valid trade that (43:41 - 43:47)
is not something you can look for yep (43:44 - 43:49)
and you're just you're just clogging up (43:47 - 43:52)
our servers with a bunch of garbage that (43:49 - 43:54)
is something that they should prioritize (43:52 - 43:57)
ten years into this process and when (43:54 - 44:00)
it's a major part of your program when (43:57 - 44:02)
you're saying pay for three extra slots (44:00 - 44:05)
to gain access to the GTS by the way (44:02 - 44:08)
we've done nothing to it it is still hot (44:05 - 44:10)
garbage full of hot garbage we've (44:08 - 44:12)
improved it in no way and not only that (44:10 - 44:14)
you can't trains with your friends (44:12 - 44:16)
across the country or across the world (44:14 - 44:22)
give us your 16 bucks excuse me (44:16 - 44:24)
so you can't trade with your friends (44:22 - 44:26)
across the world you just have to (44:24 - 44:30)
enhance it you have to use room trade so (44:26 - 44:32)
I know that for sure works I don't know (44:30 - 44:33)
what about the first part I can't speak (44:32 - 44:35)
to that room trade random like you get a (44:33 - 44:37)
random you think you can room trade with (44:35 - 44:39)
just one other person so you both join (44:37 - 44:41)
the room trade because room trade you (44:39 - 44:42)
have to give out a code so like if I (44:41 - 44:45)
start a room trade for you I can give (44:42 - 44:46)
you a code you can join it and then we (44:45 - 44:48)
both pick Pokemon in that trade works I (44:46 - 44:50)
know for sure that roads will be the (44:48 - 44:53)
death of us seriously well bit is no (44:50 - 44:55)
better than trading in I mean how long (44:53 - 44:58)
is the code I please say it's better (44:55 - 45:00)
that I have not room traded yet I just (44:58 - 45:02)
know that as if it's for we're in the (45:00 - 45:04)
same problem that sword and shields in (45:02 - 45:08)
like come on I don't know I don't know I (45:04 - 45:10)
hundred percent agree with you that it's (45:08 - 45:11)
been ten years of the GTS and they can't (45:10 - 45:13)
figure out basic things that are clearly (45:11 - 45:15)
issues level wooden Venus or shiny (45:13 - 45:17)
Victini shiny Victini is like a good (45:15 - 45:19)
example of a pokemon that has never ever (45:17 - 45:22)
been released and yet multiple people (45:19 - 45:24)
have gotten shiny victini's wonder (45:22 - 45:26)
traded to them there is a simple and (45:24 - 45:27)
basic check that needs to exist for that (45:26 - 45:30)
and they haven't implemented it same (45:27 - 45:32)
with level one venusaur although I think (45:30 - 45:34)
like level 15 Dragon Knight is (45:32 - 45:35)
technically illegal because I think you (45:34 - 45:37)
could have caught a level 15 Dragon (45:35 - 45:38)
Knight in altars (45:37 - 45:41)
Ultra moon in like a 1% SOS encounter (45:38 - 45:43)
but yes may also landed so there's (45:41 - 45:45)
already like that that is a huge problem (45:43 - 45:48)
that some people don't care about and (45:45 - 45:50)
that's always pushed me away from the (45:48 - 45:54)
GTS I like obviously be be hacked I am (45:50 - 45:55)
sure it exists but I don't think there's (45:54 - 45:57)
ever been a situation where meloetta has (45:55 - 46:00)
not been in a cherish ball or marsh (45:57 - 46:03)
shadow has not been in cherish ball and (46:00 - 46:04)
I'm sure that I'm sure there are more (46:03 - 46:07)
shadows in moon balls or meloetta Zin (46:04 - 46:09)
luxury balls that are existing and all (46:07 - 46:10)
of those Pokemon are obviously faked (46:09 - 46:14)
fake Pokemon yeah I do they do they not (46:10 - 46:18)
care are they unaware is it just broken (46:14 - 46:21)
because to me my complaint was this GTS (46:18 - 46:24)
feels like it's just no pun intended (46:21 - 46:26)
over the last couple episodes they just (46:24 - 46:29)
copy and pasted it from Mexico High and (46:26 - 46:33)
plopped it into here and like the (46:29 - 46:35)
legendary filters can't even figure out (46:33 - 46:38)
if type nul qualifies as a legendary or (46:35 - 46:40)
not it does by the way it just the (46:38 - 46:42)
filters doesn't roof like that so yes I (46:40 - 46:44)
do agree with you there I will say (46:42 - 46:46)
though I have a lick of cough I have a (46:44 - 46:50)
little bit of confidence because Pokemon (46:46 - 46:52)
homes shipped with one point zero point (46:50 - 46:55)
two and within the not even five days of (46:52 - 46:56)
it being out it's already at one point (46:55 - 46:58)
zero point four so they have pushed two (46:56 - 47:01)
updates as we're recording it it's the (46:58 - 47:01)
weekend (47:01 - 47:05)
I doubt any developer or anyone working (47:01 - 47:07)
on Pokemon home worked on it this (47:05 - 47:09)
weekend they probably shipped one point (47:07 - 47:11)
zero point four said it's stable enough (47:09 - 47:13)
where it's working we'll come back on (47:11 - 47:14)
Monday and we'll start implementing (47:13 - 47:17)
stuff oh you better get me on in on that (47:14 - 47:19)
person's performance admission no time (47:17 - 47:21)
off for failures buddy (47:19 - 47:26)
heck no if we don't get time off for an (47:21 - 47:29)
iPhone watch y'all don't get it for home (47:26 - 47:31)
what weekends are for people who give us (47:29 - 47:34)
a functional wonder trades weekends (47:31 - 47:37)
aren't for you bud I have faith I (47:34 - 47:40)
believe that Pokemon bank had like three (47:37 - 47:44)
updates in the seven years that existed (47:40 - 47:47)
but how what kind of a testament to it (47:44 - 47:50)
is to the quality of Pokemon home is it (47:47 - 47:51)
that they've had to have four (47:50 - 47:53)
updates in one week it's like we (47:51 - 47:56)
released without actually thinking or (47:53 - 48:00)
Terran I don't have to be fair for $16 (47:56 - 48:02)
yeah but like app development is (48:00 - 48:05)
extremely hard and there are not only (48:02 - 48:07)
iOS devices but there's Android devices (48:05 - 48:10)
but not only are people running those on (48:07 - 48:13)
iOS 13 but probably thirteen point one (48:10 - 48:15)
probably twelve point four probably (48:13 - 48:16)
eleven point nine I think as long as (48:15 - 48:18)
you're running iOS 9 and higher you're (48:16 - 48:20)
allowed to use Pokemon home on top of (48:18 - 48:22)
like the different processors and then (48:20 - 48:24)
you go over to Android I'm sure somebody (48:22 - 48:26)
who's like I made an app it's not that (48:24 - 48:28)
complicated but it is okay that's fine (48:26 - 48:31)
but they have tons of money and they are (48:28 - 48:33)
already withholding features that they (48:31 - 48:34)
know that they don't have ready there is (48:33 - 48:37)
no integration with Pokemon go alright (48:34 - 48:39)
leave out the wonder trade until you can (48:37 - 48:42)
make it a not garbage wonder trade right (48:39 - 48:45)
and still like take my 16 dollars and (48:42 - 48:46)
say in two months you can have wonder (48:45 - 48:48)
trade you know what actually I'll hold (48:46 - 48:49)
off on my 16 dollars until you give me (48:48 - 48:51)
the good wonder trade and Greg can (48:49 - 48:54)
verify for me it's like there's no (48:51 - 48:57)
excuse for a company of this level with (48:54 - 49:00)
this much money to release a product (48:57 - 49:03)
that's so crummy and with just like so (49:00 - 49:07)
poorly documented and just fundamentally (49:03 - 49:10)
for me and this is really what I got (49:07 - 49:12)
from the conversation with Greg (49:10 - 49:17)
previously was hey why can't it be one (49:12 - 49:20)
application why does it literally have (49:17 - 49:22)
to be something completely different (49:20 - 49:25)
between the switch and the phone why do (49:22 - 49:27)
I need to learn two applications to do (49:25 - 49:31)
one thing manage my cloud stored Pokemon (49:27 - 49:36)
why it's just it makes no sense and like (49:31 - 49:39)
finding out that you can zoom in and (49:36 - 49:43)
zoom out oh it's like an it's it's like (49:39 - 49:45)
old style programs where it's like the (49:43 - 49:46)
developers put it out didn't tell you (49:45 - 49:48)
how to use it and you are literally (49:46 - 49:49)
relying and your friends and other (49:48 - 49:51)
people on the internet say hey did you (49:49 - 49:54)
know you could do this no I didn't that (49:51 - 49:56)
would make this so much better oh thank (49:54 - 49:58)
you person they're telling me this is (49:56 - 50:00)
they bought into the snapchat mentality (49:58 - 50:02)
we're not going to explain anything to (50:00 - 50:04)
anybody so that the people who (50:02 - 50:06)
figure it out can be the cool kids oh (50:04 - 50:08)
that's not what I needed from my Pokemon (50:06 - 50:12)
home is more like the Pokemon homeless (50:08 - 50:12)
so besides GTS and trading being a mess (50:14 - 50:22)
my Pokemon list like Pokemon go on in (50:18 - 50:24)
the home app being a nightmare yes I see (50:22 - 50:27)
I don't think that's like an issue I do (50:24 - 50:31)
it's so easy to filter though it should (50:27 - 50:33)
also be easy to have them in the order (50:31 - 50:34)
that I put them in an easily (50:33 - 50:36)
recognizable on the main switch so that (50:34 - 50:38)
when I go to the home app I'm not (50:36 - 50:40)
confronted with a completely different (50:38 - 50:43)
UI that I have to now learn well my (50:40 - 50:46)
complaint was how the like why button is (50:43 - 50:48)
like inverse and the X button is inverse (50:46 - 50:50)
on the switch version compared to sword (50:48 - 50:53)
and shield cuz they're like hit the X is (50:50 - 50:55)
it like you hit the X button and certain (50:53 - 50:58)
shields like toggle between yes select (50:55 - 51:01)
all select one or like swap but in the (50:58 - 51:03)
switch for in the home version you hit (51:01 - 51:07)
like the Ellen R button you hit the it's (51:03 - 51:10)
the other is it's not the Ln R it's the (51:07 - 51:12)
ones below it's the no no Ellen R is how (51:10 - 51:16)
you filter between the ones Y like swap (51:12 - 51:17)
button is like Y instead of like (51:16 - 51:20)
exercising if something that many ways (51:17 - 51:21)
the to you guys don't match each other (51:20 - 51:23)
and that's extremely frustrating cuz (51:21 - 51:25)
your realize that don't match each other (51:23 - 51:27)
cuz there's the one in sword and shield (51:25 - 51:29)
there's the home switch and there's the (51:27 - 51:31)
home app on the mobile yes (51:29 - 51:35)
and none of a match which is like really (51:31 - 51:38)
none of these are gonna work the same (51:35 - 51:40)
also you're gonna give me a list of (51:38 - 51:41)
challenges but not tell me what I'm (51:40 - 51:43)
working for I just have to randomly (51:41 - 51:45)
stumble on to them and one of your (51:43 - 51:47)
challenges whatever challenges is using (51:45 - 51:50)
the wonder box the wonder box that is (51:47 - 51:53)
deeply problematic which I don't want to (51:50 - 51:56)
touch it it's too scary yeah I don't (51:53 - 51:58)
touch it either but that's it that is (51:56 - 51:59)
one of the things that's one of the (51:58 - 52:02)
challenges and I've done it I've used it (51:59 - 52:03)
I mean I've had successful wonder trades (52:02 - 52:07)
but it's just like also it took 10-15 (52:03 - 52:10)
hours for my wonder box trades to go (52:07 - 52:11)
through (52:10 - 52:14)
what's you know I think what's really (52:11 - 52:16)
frustrating too is we had so much hope (52:14 - 52:20)
for what this was going to be and just (52:16 - 52:25)
just for it to be so not that is a huge (52:20 - 52:28)
disappointment for sixteen dollars and (52:25 - 52:33)
has been said that you know once I've (52:28 - 52:34)
bought the sixteen dollars and brought (52:33 - 52:36)
everything over and I'm over the thirty (52:34 - 52:38)
I'm locked into sixteen dollars for the (52:36 - 52:41)
life of this the life of this program if (52:38 - 52:42)
I ever want to get them out again (52:41 - 52:45)
because we don't know what happens if (52:42 - 52:47)
you stop paying what thirty do you get (52:45 - 52:49)
Harry say they they specifically say on (52:47 - 52:51)
their website so that's so that's not (52:49 - 52:53)
what sort of you get access to if you (52:51 - 52:54)
stop plant if you stop paying your (52:53 - 52:56)
Pokemon do not get deleted you just (52:54 - 53:00)
cannot withdraw or put in so any of them (52:56 - 53:03)
any of them so you don't even get the (53:00 - 53:04)
box of thirty anymore (53:03 - 53:06)
it's just they'll get the box of 30 (53:04 - 53:08)
although I'm not completely sure which (53:06 - 53:10)
Pokemon are sitting in the initial box (53:08 - 53:13)
actually I'm assuming the initial box on (53:10 - 53:15)
that one is it the first thirty that you (53:13 - 53:17)
have on home is it which first thirty (53:15 - 53:20)
eight it is it like that's another thing (53:17 - 53:22)
that they don't explain like you don't (53:20 - 53:24)
get access to the other own grant fine (53:22 - 53:27)
so I've got ones that are locked away (53:24 - 53:29)
which you I is telling me which thirty I (53:27 - 53:34)
get well ask pokey boy hey long since (53:29 - 53:36)
it's all he's saying is hey look at (53:34 - 53:37)
these challenges you don't want to do (53:36 - 53:40)
the thing is I will say this the thing (53:37 - 53:42)
is I I have been using a lot of home I (53:40 - 53:44)
really want to like it (53:42 - 53:48)
I really want to be able to use it I (53:44 - 53:51)
want it to be more than what it is but (53:48 - 53:53)
I'm already confronted with a bunch of (53:51 - 53:55)
just decisions that don't make sense (53:53 - 53:59)
that are actually very frustrating to (53:55 - 54:02)
use and I'm only sticking with it (53:59 - 54:06)
because I'm a huge fan and I have so (54:02 - 54:08)
many Pokemon that I want to bring up and (54:06 - 54:11)
yeah it was absolutely cool to bring the (54:08 - 54:13)
Rosalia that I bred an emerald that I (54:11 - 54:16)
created there I have now brought it all (54:13 - 54:17)
the way up to home that is that was a (54:16 - 54:21)
great moment for me but it's a nightmare (54:17 - 54:25)
to get there and so many people who (54:21 - 54:29)
are less into this system (54:25 - 54:33)
are just it's just a turn-off it's just (54:29 - 54:36)
like this could be something and it's (54:33 - 54:40)
not it is a barely better version of (54:36 - 54:43)
Bank at this point and that's really (54:40 - 54:46)
frustrating it's better than Bank it is (54:43 - 54:49)
there's undeniably that it's better than (54:46 - 54:51)
Bank but it's not that much better I (54:49 - 54:55)
have confidence because this is the same (54:51 - 54:57)
conversation more or less that we had (54:55 - 55:00)
when Pokemon go came out and Pokemon go (54:57 - 55:04)
has added a million new features since (55:00 - 55:07)
the three plus years it's been around it (55:04 - 55:10)
had prot it had a way worse start than (55:07 - 55:13)
this did when we couldn't even get into (55:10 - 55:16)
it well I mean people couldn't download (55:13 - 55:20)
it for 48 hours so let's like and if you (55:16 - 55:21)
had if you had a trainer club account (55:20 - 55:23)
you couldn't get into it at all and it (55:21 - 55:26)
was you linked it so you can't you can't (55:23 - 55:28)
change anymore and and then if and all (55:26 - 55:30)
the people with the Google accounts they (55:28 - 55:33)
were having the time of their life no (55:30 - 55:34)
release is perfect and that's not even (55:33 - 55:37)
the main thing is that even if this (55:34 - 55:39)
release was perfect the product that (55:37 - 55:42)
they're presenting is below expectation (55:39 - 55:46)
below my expectation I will say that (55:42 - 55:47)
like other people have I'm sure loved it (55:46 - 55:49)
and they're like oh what it was a place (55:47 - 55:51)
to store 50,000 Pokemon I don't care if (55:49 - 55:53)
they're act right things that you were (55:51 - 55:55)
specifically complaining about the GTS (55:53 - 55:56)
the Wonder trade the friend thing like (55:55 - 55:59)
that was something that was not on my (55:56 - 56:01)
radar specifically just because I never (55:59 - 56:03)
planned on using those features although (56:01 - 56:05)
I do a completely acknowledge that the (56:03 - 56:07)
fact that basic checks like shiny (56:05 - 56:09)
Victini mail still landed it that's (56:07 - 56:11)
unacceptable for them to not even have (56:09 - 56:13)
those basic checks but the core feature (56:11 - 56:16)
that I was paying for which is getting (56:13 - 56:18)
all the Pokemon in one place seeing it (56:16 - 56:22)
on my iphone to me is worth the sixteen (56:18 - 56:25)
dollars and I do love the label system I (56:22 - 56:27)
was able to import all of Irene's (56:25 - 56:30)
Pokemon because I'm a thief and I stole (56:27 - 56:33)
all her Pokemon yep from her copy of (56:30 - 56:38)
moon and then her copy of ultra moon (56:33 - 56:38)
and then because they were - they were (56:38 - 56:42)
both named Irene but they have different (56:40 - 56:44)
player IDs I was able to highlight all (56:42 - 56:46)
those Pokemon and assign on Irene label (56:44 - 56:49)
to it so now just by filtering through (56:46 - 56:53)
labels I can instantly see all of (56:49 - 56:57)
Irene's Pokemon quickly I can then also (56:53 - 57:00)
label all the ultra beasts as ultra (56:57 - 57:01)
beasts so I can quickly find them no (57:00 - 57:03)
matter where they are and I think that's (57:01 - 57:04)
more important that's why I'm not (57:03 - 57:06)
hanging on to that box thing as you are (57:04 - 57:08)
Greg it's just different types of (57:06 - 57:10)
organization some people might like (57:08 - 57:11)
wooden hangers some people might like (57:10 - 57:14)
plastic hangers as long as there's no (57:11 - 57:17)
wire hanging up never listen here (57:14 - 57:19)
Christina we're gonna get this floor (57:17 - 57:21)
clean if we're gonna organize these (57:19 - 57:25)
pokemon Christina but the the labeling (57:21 - 57:28)
system on top of how I've already used (57:25 - 57:31)
markings is is is like the best like I (57:28 - 57:34)
love the overall Pokemon go like look (57:31 - 57:35)
that there are no boxes I can just (57:34 - 57:37)
scroll through it I actually do prefer (57:35 - 57:41)
that it's weird so that makes me just I (57:37 - 57:43)
stare at it and I'm like I don't want to (57:41 - 57:45)
be here I want to leave the switch (57:43 - 57:46)
version kind of has both it has the (57:45 - 57:48)
boxes but then if you hit like the Y (57:46 - 57:51)
button you have the entire list view (57:48 - 57:53)
which is ultimately like that Pokemon go (57:51 - 57:58)
view I love how I was actually really (57:53 - 57:59)
curious how how they were gonna show the (57:58 - 58:04)
Pokemon but like the little flat 2d 3d (57:59 - 58:05)
models that they have I think look (58:04 - 58:08)
really great and I love that you can see (58:05 - 58:09)
the difference between if they are shiny (58:08 - 58:11)
or if they're not shiny like right on (58:09 - 58:13)
your device yeah you can search by shiny (58:11 - 58:16)
which was you know something I didn't (58:13 - 58:18)
think was going to happen on both (58:16 - 58:21)
devices you can certain you can favorite (58:18 - 58:24)
Pokemon which is great that was (58:21 - 58:26)
something that came from Pokemon go that (58:24 - 58:28)
I really wanted you can search by pokey (58:26 - 58:30)
ruse which is something that was not (58:28 - 58:32)
advertised that we didn't think like oh (58:30 - 58:34)
is it does it have pokey wrists is it a (58:32 - 58:37)
cured pokey wrist so that's an awesome (58:34 - 58:39)
search feature there is no search for (58:37 - 58:41)
what was the other thing that would have (58:39 - 58:43)
been obvious there's no search for like (58:41 - 58:44)
does this Pokemon have a ribbon which is (58:43 - 58:45)
a bit of a bummer but I've already (58:44 - 58:48)
marked all my ribbons with like this (58:45 - 58:51)
search by IVs you can't I you can (58:48 - 58:55)
ah no I don't think so hmm you can (58:51 - 58:58)
search by game so you can search by like (58:55 - 59:00)
what game did it touch last did it touch (58:58 - 59:03)
pokemon home last a touch (59:00 - 59:05)
let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee you can (59:03 - 59:08)
search by how these Pokemon move to a (59:05 - 59:09)
game like can can I search by all (59:08 - 59:11)
Pokemon that can be available in Pokemon (59:09 - 59:16)
shield which is great so there is so (59:11 - 59:18)
with all the complaints aside there is (59:16 - 59:20)
some really powerful things you can do (59:18 - 59:23)
searching marking and labeling wise that (59:20 - 59:27)
I think like if there was no GTS if (59:23 - 59:30)
there was no wonder trade like the (59:27 - 59:33)
searching alone to me is worth it like (59:30 - 59:36)
I'm already up to 3200 Pokemon and I (59:33 - 59:38)
haven't even moved any Pokemon over from (59:36 - 59:41)
my copies of black black to her cold (59:38 - 59:43)
soul silver platinum because I'm trying (59:41 - 59:45)
to get a living Dex in black too before (59:43 - 59:49)
I move those 500 plus Pokemon over but (59:45 - 59:50)
these these are other Pokemon that came (59:49 - 59:53)
from my like XY Sun Moon Omega Ruby (59:50 - 59:56)
copies so I'm like super super happy (59:53 - 59:59)
with that and they'll again going back (59:56 - 60:01)
to like the label things with something (59:59 - 60:02)
I didn't think I wanted but man it makes (60:01 - 60:06)
it so great in combination with like the (60:02 - 60:08)
other ways I specifically search (60:06 - 60:11)
although labels not being so you can see (60:08 - 60:13)
a label marking on the switch but you (60:11 - 60:15)
can't mark labels on the switch which is (60:13 - 60:18)
really weird mm-hmm the box (60:15 - 60:20)
organizational features of Pokemon home (60:18 - 60:24)
I am super satisfied with and the the (60:20 - 60:26)
the one thing that is really cool also (60:24 - 60:31)
is how you can on switch because they (60:26 - 60:33)
use boxes you can move an entire box (60:31 - 60:36)
normally you would press like the LR to (60:33 - 60:37)
switch it to the green the green is like (60:36 - 60:40)
to select all but if you you can (60:37 - 60:41)
actually pick up an entire box and you (60:40 - 60:42)
can move it (60:41 - 60:46)
instead of having so this is this is (60:42 - 60:47)
like hard to explain visually so let's (60:46 - 60:49)
say like in sort and shield you have (60:47 - 60:51)
like box one box two box three box 4 box (60:49 - 60:54)
5 etc up to 32 and you might have (60:51 - 60:56)
renamed those boxes to like shiny one (60:54 - 61:00)
like shiny box one GMAX box one GMAX box (60:56 - 61:03)
two and so ideally if you were to select (61:00 - 61:05)
all the pokemon and the GMAX (61:03 - 61:07)
and move it over into home you would (61:05 - 61:08)
then have to go into home and then (61:07 - 61:10)
rename that home box like GMAX box one (61:08 - 61:13)
but instead a cool feature is you can (61:10 - 61:16)
literally lift up the entire box so if (61:13 - 61:20)
you named G box G max box 1 G max box 2 (61:16 - 61:22)
G max box 3 and pokemon sword and shield (61:20 - 61:24)
you can picked up pick up all three of (61:22 - 61:26)
those boxes name included background (61:24 - 61:29)
included and move them into home and it (61:26 - 61:31)
keeps everything there which is really (61:29 - 61:34)
great because you can start organizing (61:31 - 61:37)
and arranging no matter where you are (61:34 - 61:40)
and not have to be like oh well I have (61:37 - 61:42)
to rename 14 boxes in home and I have to (61:40 - 61:44)
rename 14 boxes and sword and shield (61:42 - 61:46)
because that's it takes 14 boxes to (61:44 - 61:48)
complete my living decks you can just (61:46 - 61:51)
literally lift the whole box up which is (61:48 - 61:54)
really great umm I think I think the (61:51 - 61:57)
interface on the eye I think the go (61:54 - 62:00)
interface on iOS I like it I guess Greg (61:57 - 62:03)
doesn't but I think it's garbage I love (62:00 - 62:05)
it I love the like the zoom in I love (62:03 - 62:07)
that I can see my shiny Machamp right (62:05 - 62:08)
next to my other Machamp right next to (62:07 - 62:11)
all my machop's I love being able to (62:08 - 62:12)
click on it and then tap the little I (62:11 - 62:15)
can look at the Eevee's I can tap it (62:12 - 62:18)
again to see the the judge stuff I can (62:15 - 62:20)
see that it has pokey wrist I can scroll (62:18 - 62:21)
down Oh beaut (62:20 - 62:24)
Bob I can see all my ribbons here on (62:21 - 62:26)
this Machamp that I transferred up from (62:24 - 62:28)
Crystal but wait what would be the point (62:26 - 62:30)
to my accepting your friend request (62:28 - 62:33)
there's nothing we can do (62:30 - 62:37)
I can see if you're a gen 1 or not by (62:33 - 62:41)
what icon if not I can i okay the (62:37 - 62:43)
sticker stuff is really to reel-to-reel (62:41 - 62:47)
the icons you can be a real set yeah (62:43 - 62:48)
it's pretty limited there's only like 8 (62:47 - 62:50)
choices I can see the cool sticker (62:48 - 62:53)
things you have (62:50 - 62:55)
I have no stickers hit question answered (62:53 - 62:58)
yeah oh that interface is also super (62:55 - 63:00)
frustrating like how do I get to my room (62:58 - 63:03)
to put on stickers oh I have to click on (63:00 - 63:05)
my name there's nothing that says my (63:03 - 63:08)
room all right I also feel about (63:05 - 63:09)
stickers the same way I figure feel (63:08 - 63:13)
about Funko pops alright I had this (63:09 - 63:16)
question I'm looking at the the fa Q's (63:13 - 63:18)
here I had this question can I access (63:16 - 63:20)
Pokemon home on multiple smart devices (63:18 - 63:21)
or Nintendo switch consoles wasn't (63:20 - 63:23)
linked to a Nintendo account you can (63:21 - 63:25)
access your Pokemon home from one smart (63:23 - 63:28)
device and multiple Nintendo switch (63:25 - 63:28)
consoles (63:28 - 63:32)
yeah and how ridiculous is that so I (63:28 - 63:34)
can't use Pokemon home on my iPhone and (63:32 - 63:37)
my iPad yeah it's I I haven't I haven't (63:34 - 63:39)
even downloaded the iPad version I don't (63:37 - 63:44)
even know if it's a fourth interface I I (63:39 - 63:47)
doubt it I just hope it's not the tiny (63:44 - 63:50)
iPhone interface on an iPad screen which (63:47 - 63:52)
they used to do back in the day each (63:50 - 63:54)
Pokemon home account is limited to one (63:52 - 63:56)
smart device at a time linking your (63:54 - 63:58)
Nintendo accounts your Pokemon home on a (63:56 - 64:00)
new smart device will transfer your (63:58 - 64:02)
information to the new device okay so (64:00 - 64:03)
the coolest thing that we didn't talk (64:02 - 64:05)
about as we're waiting for this link (64:03 - 64:09)
trade is coolest it is really cool I (64:05 - 64:12)

on the switch it'll say like move from (66:25 - 66:32)
Pokemon bank and it will say like do you (66:28 - 66:35)
have your 3ds yes or no and if you say (66:32 - 66:40)
no it will read your Nintendo ID the (66:35 - 66:42)
email you used and since obviously on (66:40 - 66:45)
the switch and on my 3ds I used the same (66:42 - 66:47)
Nintendo ID which is my personal email (66:45 - 66:51)
address it then saw that it saw my I (66:47 - 66:53)
have two Pokemon banks I have one (66:51 - 66:55)
Pokemon bank on my original DS that I (66:53 - 66:57)
used everyday and then I had another (66:55 - 67:00)
Pokemon Bank which was tied to a Disney (66:57 - 67:03)
female because that other 3ds was the (67:00 - 67:05)
3ds that has a capture card in it that I (67:03 - 67:09)
used to stream and so I said I was like (67:05 - 67:10)
let me just test this I'm gonna say no (67:09 - 67:13)
that I don't have my 3ds but I did it (67:10 - 67:15)
was just wasn't on and it was able to (67:13 - 67:16)
read that original Pokemon bank which (67:15 - 67:18)
only had like 30 Pokemon in and (67:16 - 67:21)
instantly transfer them all over because (67:18 - 67:24)
that 3ds downloaded Pokemon home with (67:21 - 67:27)
the same email address which was tied to (67:24 - 67:29)
my Nintendo ID that my switches which is (67:27 - 67:30)
awesome for anyone who (67:29 - 67:33)
did sell theirs they sell their 3ds or (67:30 - 67:36)
traded in or do whatever they did with (67:33 - 67:36)
it (67:36 - 67:39)
oh it's trading the far fetch there it (67:36 - 67:40)
goes (67:39 - 67:42)
oh this information is really sweet yeah (67:40 - 67:45)
there any animations good also like (67:42 - 67:47)
Captain Planet just like destroyed that (67:45 - 67:51)
pokeball yeah oh nice boring polka ball (67:47 - 67:52)
you sent me I think that was a far (67:51 - 67:55)
fetched in let's go I give you (67:52 - 67:58)
personally cared for inbred trades and (67:55 - 68:01)
you give me some random stranger you (67:58 - 68:06)
picked up on the streets of Kanto so if (68:01 - 68:07)
we go to continue trading it puts us (68:06 - 68:09)
back in the same room which is pretty (68:07 - 68:11)
cool I'm out okay well there you go now (68:09 - 68:13)
we know how to trade two people (68:11 - 68:15)
specifically two people specifically in (68:13 - 68:18)
the most convoluted a hundred and eighty (68:15 - 68:21)
second way each time so that that saved (68:18 - 68:24)
a bunch of people who that's a weird (68:21 - 68:25)
thing to me I guess like if I cared (68:24 - 68:27)
about Pokemon and I cared about Pokemon (68:25 - 68:30)
pink I don't think I would sell my only (68:27 - 68:32)
3ds with access to Pokemon bank on it (68:30 - 68:34)
that's just me but I guess those people (68:32 - 68:36)
existed because I talked to all of those (68:34 - 68:38)
people yep so then the other way you can (68:36 - 68:41)
do it is yes I have my 3ds and then (68:38 - 68:43)
you're inside the 3ds it'll say like (68:41 - 68:45)
because the the Pokemon bank had an (68:43 - 68:47)
update it'll say like generate a QR code (68:45 - 68:49)
and then you type that code in or you (68:47 - 68:51)
type that like 16 to 12 digit code into (68:49 - 68:54)
your switch and then it initiate the (68:51 - 68:57)
transfer and and that's really cool it's (68:54 - 68:59)
like that it worked really well it was (68:57 - 69:01)
very convenient for people who no longer (68:59 - 69:03)
had access to their 3ds whether they (69:01 - 69:05)
sold it whether they broke it whether (69:03 - 69:07)
it's somewhere in their house and they (69:05 - 69:10)
just can't find it that is a really (69:07 - 69:11)
really cool feature that worked (69:10 - 69:14)
extremely well and probably saved a (69:11 - 69:17)
bunch of people's pokémon well it's (69:14 - 69:19)
gonna save paintings Pokemon can other (69:17 - 69:21)
players online do tend to switch console (69:19 - 69:22)
access my Pokemon when using Pokemon (69:21 - 69:24)
home players can choose to deposit and (69:22 - 69:26)
withdraw Pokemon to and from compatible (69:24 - 69:28)
services on their Nintendo switch this (69:26 - 69:30)
means other players with Pokemon home (69:28 - 69:32)
can access Pokemon from your games (69:30 - 69:34)
unattended switch be careful not to (69:32 - 69:36)
transfer all their players Pokemon on (69:34 - 69:38)
your console without permission (69:36 - 69:40)
I guess that still doesn't answer my (69:38 - 69:41)
question like if I have two accounts on (69:40 - 69:43)
my switch do they still see the both the (69:41 - 69:44)
same home (69:43 - 69:48)
hmm I thought I had to indicate who I (69:44 - 69:49)
was playing as when I opened Pokemon (69:48 - 69:54)
home so Oh interests a B how can I trade (69:49 - 69:56)
pokémon with other players in Pokemon (69:54 - 69:58)
home there are four ways to trade Greg (69:56 - 70:01)
using Pokemon and Pokemon home wonder (69:58 - 70:06)
box GTS room trade and friend trade can (70:01 - 70:08)
I trade with specific friends players (70:06 - 70:11)
ages 16 and older can use the trip (70:08 - 70:13)
friend trade feature to trade pokémon (70:11 - 70:15)
with other users you become friends with (70:13 - 70:18)
on a smart device you can add friends in (70:15 - 70:20)
the add friend feature be friends listen (70:18 - 70:22)
Pokemon home is not connected to your (70:20 - 70:24)
friends list yet we already know that (70:22 - 70:26)
Pokemon can only be traded with the (70:24 - 70:27)
mobile version of home switch does not (70:26 - 70:30)
support trade feature (70:27 - 70:32)
we knew that so (70:30 - 70:34)
then there's a couple things so when you (70:32 - 70:37)
when you sign up for Pokemon home you (70:34 - 70:42)
get the Pikachu which I uh I heard some (70:37 - 70:44)
people got an English Pikachu some (70:42 - 70:46)
people got a Japanese Pikachu I got a (70:44 - 70:47)
Japanese Pikachu (70:46 - 70:50)
I got a Japanese Pikachu the one that (70:47 - 70:53)
they gave me for free yeah yeah I don't (70:50 - 70:56)
know look at it (70:53 - 70:58)
I have to find it (70:56 - 70:59)
because I only have my mobile phone up (70:58 - 71:02)
here so I know what box it is in but can (70:59 - 71:04)
I find it here I got there's four pika - (71:02 - 71:07)
how many Pikachu's you got I have like (71:04 - 71:10)
been playing this game for 200 years (71:07 - 71:12)
he's got a thousand Pikachu's I just (71:10 - 71:15)
like 80 and hats (71:12 - 71:17)
the one thing they give you doesn't have (71:15 - 71:21)
a hat okay you can't search on hat vs. (71:17 - 71:24)
no hat that's sure there's no excessive (71:21 - 71:28)
research if you okay so it's all I have (71:24 - 71:29)
witnesses seem to have a fateful (71:28 - 71:32)
encounter in Pokemon home it is just (71:29 - 71:36)
named Pikachu and it's English Oh weird (71:32 - 71:39)
you got an English one when did I get a (71:36 - 71:41)
shiny Pikachu in was it the one from (71:39 - 71:43)
sorowitsch ball it wasn't long from (71:41 - 71:47)
Target I bet oh that's it (71:43 - 71:51)
look at all these lame hats if you used (71:47 - 71:53)
one label for the first time it gives (71:51 - 71:55)
you a Pichu (71:53 - 71:57)
also when you install the mobile version (71:55 - 71:59)
it gives you a choice between Charmander (71:57 - 72:01)
squirtle and Bulbasaur think you have to (71:59 - 72:04)
transfer from Pokemon bank to make that (72:01 - 72:08)
appear and then you can you can pick (72:04 - 72:09)
either Charmander Bulbasaur squirtle and (72:08 - 72:11)
then the specific starter will have the (72:09 - 72:14)
hidden ability yep I went with squirtle (72:11 - 72:17)
which is cool because then you can breed (72:14 - 72:21)
that and trade those two to your friends (72:17 - 72:24)
and then I've heard so this this is (72:21 - 72:25)
there's there's a couple issues with it (72:24 - 72:26)
some people weren't getting their (72:25 - 72:28)
Pikachu right away some people weren't (72:26 - 72:29)
getting their Pichu I think this has to (72:28 - 72:32)
do with servers and how it detects if (72:29 - 72:34)
you complete your national dex which is (72:32 - 72:37)
at this point of recording 890 Pokemon (72:34 - 72:39)
you will get the original form McGee (72:37 - 72:42)
erna which is supposed to be the McGee (72:39 - 72:45)
erna in the that looks like the pokeball (72:42 - 72:48)
colors the McGee Erna that you get in (72:45 - 72:50)
Sun and Moon or ultra Sun alternate I (72:48 - 72:51)
should say the QR code which you can (72:50 - 72:52)
still do by the way if you're missing (72:51 - 72:55)
McGee Rinna you can go to Pokemon (72:52 - 72:57)
official website find the QR code scan (72:55 - 73:00)
it transfer it up that's like the all (72:57 - 73:02)
silver one which is like the non (73:00 - 73:05)
original because it was like old and (73:02 - 73:07)
rusted or whatever but some people (73:05 - 73:09)
haven't gotten Miggy Rinna some people (73:07 - 73:11)
I've heard that's real hit or miss some (73:09 - 73:14)
people got McGee Rena original form some (73:11 - 73:15)
people got the McGee R now which is the (73:14 - 73:18)
not regional form so I think that'll be (73:15 - 73:21)
resolved because also some people didn't (73:18 - 73:22)
get Pikachu right away when they (73:21 - 73:23)
download the app but then like a day (73:22 - 73:27)
later the Pikachu showed up so I'm not a (73:23 - 73:28)
hundred percent sure what's happening (73:27 - 73:30)
there (73:28 - 73:32)
did I never put any of my my gear in it (73:30 - 73:35)
into this game apparently not (73:32 - 73:38)
how could you well there it is (73:35 - 73:41)
found it there is mass transfer in (73:38 - 73:45)
Pokemon home so you can select up to 100 (73:41 - 73:48)
Pokemon and throw them away which people (73:45 - 73:50)
were very excited about if you were (73:48 - 73:51)
breeding and sword and shield you take (73:50 - 73:53)
all three of those boxes move them to (73:51 - 73:56)
home and throw them all away at once or (73:53 - 73:59)
wonder trade them into non-existence (73:56 - 74:00)
because who knows where they're going (73:59 - 74:03)
and wonder trade if you transfer from (74:00 - 74:06)
Pokemon home I believe you get 3000 home (74:03 - 74:08)
points which translates into a hundred (74:06 - 74:10)
battle points trying to think of like (74:08 - 74:12)
other things you know in the home point (74:10 - 74:15)
do yet they just turn into battle points (74:12 - 74:18)
they're just a substitute for whatever I (74:15 - 74:21)
think Pokemon bank called them pokey (74:18 - 74:23)
miles and then pokey miles turned into (74:21 - 74:26)
battle points it's the same does I mean (74:23 - 74:28)
I have like three thousand but I don't (74:26 - 74:30)
know how to make them do anything on the (74:28 - 74:32)
switch version you can cash them in cuz (74:30 - 74:34)
then you will pick either sword or (74:32 - 74:38)
shield to send them to ah so you know (74:34 - 74:39)
this difference between the UI is again (74:38 - 74:44)
such great break good great there you go (74:39 - 74:44)
search for the GTS to see what people (74:46 - 74:50)

you already have because then they can (75:48 - 75:54)
Masuda but there's no character you're (75:51 - 75:57)
gonna get a foreign language (75:54 - 76:02)
oh oh here's a Turkish for manaphy (75:57 - 76:03)
that's a good trait I should get on that (76:02 - 76:04)
one (76:03 - 76:06)
ah there there and so going back to the (76:04 - 76:11)
sticker stuff the it it does I don't (76:06 - 76:13)
know it's like spark a at least for me (76:11 - 76:14)
and everyone's different but it does (76:13 - 76:18)
spark a collecting threshold not (76:14 - 76:20)
threshold it does I guess it just makes (76:18 - 76:23)
me want to you elect you want to so you (76:20 - 76:24)
want to do complete the challenges (76:23 - 76:28)
because I want home right so you will (76:24 - 76:30)
have to wonder box trade no that's not (76:28 - 76:33)
true well it's one of the challenger (76:30 - 76:34)
boards you get a sticker for it okay yes (76:33 - 76:36)
I will have to wonder trade sure and I (76:34 - 76:38)
will just throw out everything I don't (76:36 - 76:41)
wonder trade you need it do it 25 times (76:38 - 76:44)
that's fine what okay we have to ruin (76:41 - 76:46)
truly after rune trade five more times (76:44 - 76:48)
all right well well do I get the star (76:46 - 76:50)
sticker so for example you get a unique (76:48 - 76:53)
sticker if you or like background (76:50 - 76:55)
sticker I guess if you have all the (76:53 - 76:58)
unknown in your Pokemon home which I did (76:55 - 76:59)
I was one of those people that in (76:58 - 77:02)
firered/leafgreen I caught all the (76:59 - 77:03)
unknown and then I transferred them all (77:02 - 77:05)
the way up and then you get like a (77:03 - 77:07)
unique sticker if you get all the (77:05 - 77:11)
different forms forms of mini or which I (77:07 - 77:13)
don't have and now I want to go back to (77:11 - 77:16)
Sun and Moon and catch the other how (77:13 - 77:18)
many are there eight and then you get (77:16 - 77:21)
like a sticker if you have all the forms (77:18 - 77:24)
of out crummy Pokemon home on the switch (77:21 - 77:27)
and on the mobile version actually shows (77:24 - 77:29)
you the differences between the (77:27 - 77:31)
pumpkaboo is you have and the gorg Isis (77:29 - 77:32)
you have because they have different (77:31 - 77:34)
sizes and I'm assuming once you have all (77:32 - 77:36)
the sizes I think there are five sizes (77:34 - 77:39)
of each you get a sticker there too (77:36 - 77:42)
going back to Minear they did change (77:39 - 77:45)
mini or shiny so many are now has a new (77:42 - 77:46)
shiny that you can see in Pokemon home (77:45 - 77:49)
in Pokemon on the switch and on the (77:46 - 77:51)
mobile version and they did change you (77:49 - 77:54)
have all the mini are colors yes (77:51 - 77:57)
including the shiny I don't know if you (77:54 - 77:59)
need the shiny or not I don't think you (77:57 - 78:00)
need the shiny because the one person I (77:59 - 78:02)
saw that has the minier background I (78:00 - 78:05)
don't think has a shiny is there's a (78:02 - 78:06)
background or is it a stick it's like (78:05 - 78:08)
the background sticker because if you (78:06 - 78:08)
look at my eye (78:08 - 78:11)
yeah the wallpapers sorry (78:08 - 78:13)
okay cuz I thought I moved on my mini (78:11 - 78:15)
are up here but apparently have it you (78:13 - 78:18)
might be missing a color excuse me don't (78:15 - 78:20)
think you need the shiny but that's a (78:18 - 78:22)
good question I may not have movement (78:20 - 78:24)
Munir up in here I know I have to check (78:22 - 78:26)
that should be really easy right should (78:24 - 78:30)
be not so it does make me want like oh I (78:26 - 78:32)
can visually see now in Pokemon home (78:30 - 78:34)
that I can see the pumpkaboo sizes it is (78:32 - 78:37)
they did pay I guess somebody on that (78:34 - 78:39)
team was like hey you know what we (78:37 - 78:40)
should really update mini or shiny cuz (78:39 - 78:42)
we have a bigger color palette than the (78:40 - 78:44)
3ds offered they went out of their way (78:42 - 78:47)
and they updated Castform shiny so prior (78:44 - 78:51)
to this coming out Castform had just a (78:47 - 78:53)
pink shiny and then when the weather (78:51 - 78:56)
changed I think everyone should anyone (78:53 - 78:57)
who played Pokemon go probably is very (78:56 - 78:59)
sick of Castform and it shiny because it (78:57 - 79:03)
spawned a lot on that lotad day but when (78:59 - 79:04)
Castform (79:03 - 79:07)
evolved in past games or not evolved but (79:04 - 79:09)
changed due to the weather into sunny (79:07 - 79:13)
day Castform or or rainy day Castform (79:09 - 79:15)
you could no longer tell it was shiny (79:13 - 79:18)
because the forms didn't have Chinese (79:15 - 79:21)
but now the forms actually have Chinese (79:18 - 79:24)
so they went out of their way to change (79:21 - 79:26)
those which is like great I mean they've (79:24 - 79:27)
changed Pokemon Chinese in the past (79:26 - 79:28)
they've changed (79:27 - 79:29)
Charizard shiny they've changed (79:28 - 79:31)
Typhlosion shiny (79:29 - 79:34)
I think they've changed ponyta shiny (79:31 - 79:37)
they've changed Gliscor shiny a million (79:34 - 79:41)
times for whatever reason so they have (79:37 - 79:42)
changed shinies before so those were (79:41 - 79:46)
some notable changes the GTS does have a (79:42 - 79:47)
cool feature of showing you how many (79:46 - 79:50)
Pokemon have been traded so as of this (79:47 - 79:54)
recording 1.7 million Pokemon have been (79:50 - 79:56)
wondered traded since the game has come (79:54 - 79:59)
out with the number one beings a.cian (79:56 - 80:01)
knows amazon tow is actually number one (79:59 - 80:04)
right now well that's Josh Ian got moved (80:01 - 80:09)
to number two so yeah for me it is (80:04 - 80:11)
triggering that like I want to collect (80:09 - 80:14)
all the forms but I'm sure some people (80:11 - 80:17)
don't care I did notice on the switch (80:14 - 80:19)
version if a Pokemon has gender (80:17 - 80:22)
differences so you can I think hit the (80:19 - 80:24)
start the plus button on the switch to (80:22 - 80:25)
like (80:24 - 80:26)
well if it's shiny or not so if you like (80:25 - 80:27)
hover over wheedle and you hit the start (80:26 - 80:29)
button it goes from shiny to not shiny (80:27 - 80:33)
but on a pokemon like Pikachu if you I (80:29 - 80:35)
can't see shiny male Pikachu because I (80:33 - 80:37)
don't have a shiny male Pikachu (80:35 - 80:38)
registered but if I toggle over to (80:37 - 80:40)
female Pikachu and then I hit the plus (80:38 - 80:43)
button I can flip between shiny male or (80:40 - 80:45)
shiny female and regular female Pikachu (80:43 - 80:49)
so there are attentions to detail with (80:45 - 80:49)
that kind of stuff (80:49 - 80:53)
but of course no attention to detail if (80:49 - 80:56)
shiny victini's getting wonder traded I (80:53 - 80:58)
don't know if that's like two different (80:56 - 81:02)
teams I don't know if they if (80:58 - 81:05)
something's just broken GTS wise uh it (81:02 - 81:08)
seems like there's there's the there (81:05 - 81:10)
seems to be a lot of attention to detail (81:08 - 81:16)
in the searching stuff in the search by (81:10 - 81:18)
move search by ot search by markings (81:16 - 81:20)
shiny form favorite recent game games (81:18 - 81:23)
that can go to pokey wrists the label (81:20 - 81:26)
stuff but then there's other stuff where (81:23 - 81:31)
it just doesn't seem to care I'd I don't (81:26 - 81:34)
think it's perfect I'd say I can solidly (81:31 - 81:38)
say it's not perfect but it is having (81:34 - 81:41)
Pokemon onto my my phone is definitely (81:38 - 81:42)
what I wanted and so I'm satisfied in (81:41 - 81:44)
that department I just hope that the (81:42 - 81:47)
other things get better and so they've (81:44 - 81:50)
met the the minimum criteria yeah it (81:47 - 81:52)
made it okay so and and seeing them (81:50 - 81:55)
update the game twice already is a good (81:52 - 81:56)
sign (81:55 - 81:59)
so hopefully we see another update and (81:56 - 82:01)
hopefully next time we talk we can (81:59 - 82:03)
update you on the maguey earnest (82:01 - 82:07)
situation for whatever that's worth (82:03 - 82:10)
okay we'll take a break we just got some (82:07 - 82:12)
Pokemon masters after the break our (82:10 - 82:14)
pokemon of the week and our question of (82:12 - 82:18)
the week so we will be right back I (82:14 - 82:18)
watched the anime on The WB wow I feel w (82:18 - 82:48)
[Music] (82:53 - 82:56)
we're back (82:54 - 82:58)
just a couple updates real quick I want (82:56 - 82:59)
to dwell any more time on this (82:58 - 83:02)
everything I found is room trade is (82:59 - 83:05)
local only so I don't know for a friend (83:02 - 83:07)
trader circle only various nuff friend (83:05 - 83:10)
trade is local only because the day's at (83:07 - 83:12)
just waste like four hours of this (83:10 - 83:15)
podcast trying to room trade Frank we do (83:12 - 83:17)
yeah we did room trade because friend (83:15 - 83:19)
trade is based off the GPS that's why (83:17 - 83:20)
when you go into fur and trade it says (83:19 - 83:23)
checking GPS there's nowhere I can find (83:20 - 83:27)
the reason why that is but seems to be (83:23 - 83:30)
what it is the other thing is I'm on (83:27 - 83:34)
pokemons FAQ page and they've literally (83:30 - 83:36)
been updating it as we've been doing (83:34 - 83:38)

I had to ask them to change my legal (84:50 - 84:54)
name and they were able to do it within (84:52 - 84:57)
24 hours it was actually impressive oh (84:54 - 85:00)

partnering with them and I still have (85:07 - 85:13)
yet to open the game so this is off this (85:09 - 85:16)
is off their website this is 12 13 20 21 (85:13 - 85:19)
up to the six month celebration on their (85:16 - 85:20)
way so we still don't know what the six (85:19 - 85:23)
month celebration will be we don't know (85:20 - 85:25)
what it's supposed to be at least this (85:23 - 85:28)
is just the run-up to in Pokemon masters (85:25 - 85:30)
is coming up to the six months of launch (85:28 - 85:32)
thanks to the support of all you (85:30 - 85:34)
trainers out there that's you listener (85:32 - 85:36)
driving in your car right now are (85:34 - 85:39)
washing the dishes to support we were (85:36 - 85:41)
holding various rallies a part of our (85:39 - 85:43)
six month celebration the first one is (85:41 - 85:47)
between now and February 27th which is (85:43 - 85:51)
Pokemon Day which is actually makes me (85:47 - 85:54)
curious if the new event will be the day (85:51 - 85:57)
after Pokemon Day and they will probably (85:54 - 85:58)
announce it on Pokemon Day would be my (85:57 - 86:01)
guess so the Pokemon Center will be (85:58 - 86:02)
decorated to commemorate the six-month (86:01 - 86:05)
celebration period from now until March (86:02 - 86:10)
15th and you will be able to get 300 (86:05 - 86:12)
gems which is one character poll every (86:10 - 86:14)
single day you login except on the fifth (86:12 - 86:16)
day you will get five evolution' charged (86:14 - 86:17)
the tenth day you will get five (86:16 - 86:20)
evolution shards and then the thirteenth (86:17 - 86:22)
day you will get three evolution (86:20 - 86:24)
crystals I'm assuming those are more (86:22 - 86:26)
rare than gems I have not used any of (86:24 - 86:29)
those yet personally I'm assuming that (86:26 - 86:30)
would help you evolve Pokemon though (86:29 - 86:31)
since they're called evolution shards (86:30 - 86:33)
and evolution crystals so if you're not (86:31 - 86:36)
playing masters and you're still (86:33 - 86:38)
debating about it 300 gems is a whole (86:36 - 86:40)
lot of gems that you get for free just (86:38 - 86:42)

before that Mewtwo no yes okay leo was (88:13 - 88:19)
before that and Mewtwo too had special (88:17 - 88:21)
missions but this this doesn't have (88:19 - 88:23)
special missions in the way people think (88:21 - 88:27)
it has special missions yes I I have not (88:23 - 88:27)
gotten there yet (88:27 - 88:30)
there isn't a storyline for professor (88:27 - 88:33)
oak there isn't an event that you go and (88:30 - 88:34)
click through that doesn't exist for (88:33 - 88:35)
Professor Oak I thought there was (88:34 - 88:37)
because they show him with like a (88:35 - 88:39)
knitter II know at one point there may (88:37 - 88:41)
be that there's somewhere that I haven't (88:39 - 88:43)
unlocked it but I've been playing with (88:41 - 88:46)
Professor Oak and I'm in my events and I (88:43 - 88:49)
do that see any special event (88:46 - 88:50)
specifically for Professor Oak it may (88:49 - 88:52)
happen when you get everything so (88:50 - 88:54)
according to the website it says you in (88:52 - 88:56)
order to get Professor Oak and Mew you (88:54 - 88:58)
have to complete chapter 1 to take on (88:56 - 88:59)
the special missions you have to (88:58 - 89:01)
complete chapter 2 Professor Oak and (88:59 - 89:02)
mucus (89:01 - 89:04)
in using custom items that can be (89:02 - 89:05)
attained by completing special missions (89:04 - 89:07)
which I don't know where those are yet (89:05 - 89:10)
all mission completion rewards are must (89:07 - 89:12)
be claimed within three days in order to (89:10 - 89:14)
claim them that's I don't know why you (89:12 - 89:16)
wouldn't claim your rewards once you (89:14 - 89:18)
complete it but I may be somebody forgot (89:16 - 89:21)
to a lock it's real easy to forget and (89:18 - 89:23)
they really hide where those rewards are (89:21 - 89:26)
on one screen and the there's no present (89:23 - 89:32)
no darou those are the event missions (89:26 - 89:34)
with a little bright ribbon the little (89:32 - 89:36)
ribbons that are hidden and then not in (89:34 - 89:38)
your face so unless you remember I have (89:36 - 89:40)
to go and specifically spend them and (89:38 - 89:42)
you have to go into the shop and then (89:40 - 89:43)
click to get to the right banner to (89:42 - 89:46)
spend them there it's really easy to (89:43 - 89:48)
forget that they have is it or how many (89:46 - 89:52)
you have it is not well advertised it's (89:48 - 89:54)
not in your face so it's very easy to (89:52 - 89:56)
not know how many you have or think I've (89:54 - 89:58)
spent surely I have spent them all I (89:56 - 90:00)
have not spent them all wait did the (89:58 - 90:02)
daily vouchers you get every day do they (90:00 - 90:03)
expire yep (90:02 - 90:05)
oh I should probably be using them then (90:03 - 90:09)
okay well the the event ones do as far (90:05 - 90:10)
as know the daily ones the ones that you (90:09 - 90:13)
get to power up yourself don't oh okay (90:10 - 90:13)
okay okay (90:13 - 90:15)
but like the me event ones will expire (90:13 - 90:18)
when this event is over three days after (90:15 - 90:19)
this event is over which is what March (90:18 - 90:21)
3rd that what they said something like (90:19 - 90:24)
that oh yeah because it says I have um I (90:21 - 90:30)
have 60 66 in stock and I'm pretty sure (90:24 - 90:33)
that oak knee Torino thing is from his (90:30 - 90:36)
sync story which isn't everybody gets a (90:33 - 90:39)
sync sorry it's not oh I got it it's in (90:36 - 90:42)
his sync sorry I believe ok I haven't (90:39 - 90:45)
done a sync story yet so to unlock the (90:42 - 90:46)
sync grid feature you must complete the (90:45 - 90:50)
main story of chapter 11:2 event the (90:46 - 90:52)
event to team up with mr. oak and me you (90:50 - 90:54)
may be held again in the future I would (90:52 - 90:56)
hope so I missed out on me too the (90:54 - 90:59)
special event mission to strengthen oak (90:56 - 91:01)
may be held again in the future to (90:59 - 91:03)
acquire professor oak and Mew through (91:01 - 91:06)
exchange items out you can power them up (91:03 - 91:09)
by exchanging items yeah so you can only (91:06 - 91:14)
power up oak and mu through completing (91:09 - 91:15)
missions (91:14 - 91:19)
and how come you don't use your regular (91:15 - 91:22)
supply of powerup items they use (91:19 - 91:24)
specific Professor Oak (91:22 - 91:27)
items that you can only get during this (91:24 - 91:29)
event which if you've done for old stuff (91:27 - 91:31)
like like rayquaza right you could only (91:29 - 91:34)
get dragon tickets or whatever if you go (91:31 - 91:36)
in to your move sync up and you're like (91:34 - 91:41)
well I have you know 50 you know horns (91:36 - 91:43)
and a hundred million sodas I can surely (91:41 - 91:47)
upgrade you can't because it requires (91:43 - 91:51)
special oak sodas and special Oh corns (91:47 - 91:56)
the old oak color yeah I so like you (91:51 - 91:58)
have to complete the events to power it (91:56 - 92:01)
up you can't use your existing stock and (91:58 - 92:02)
you you were saying that you weren't (92:01 - 92:05)
enjoying the oak and Mew event is it (92:02 - 92:08)
again I haven't done it but I did do the (92:05 - 92:10)
I did do a little bit of the rayquaza (92:08 - 92:12)
and a little bit of the so gaily oh I (92:10 - 92:14)
didn't find them super grindy but I also (92:12 - 92:17)
didn't power them up nearly the I was at (92:14 - 92:19)
20 out of 20 I think oh yeah (92:17 - 92:23)
2 or 3 out of 20 so there's a couple of (92:19 - 92:25)
things the first time you play with oak (92:23 - 92:28)
gets fun the 100th time you're playing (92:25 - 92:32)
with oak and mu it's less fun the issue (92:28 - 92:34)
is is how they built oak which is (92:32 - 92:36)
exciting the first couple of times you (92:34 - 92:38)
play with it but then it's like so one (92:36 - 92:40)
of the special abilities you unlock is (92:38 - 92:44)
it will randomly lower our targets one (92:40 - 92:47)
of their stats when you successfully hit (92:44 - 92:50)
and so sometimes it's very beneficial (92:47 - 92:54)
sometimes it's very much not so there's (92:50 - 92:56)
a huge amount of Swing and playing with (92:54 - 93:00)
oak and Moo when you do the sync move (92:56 - 93:03)
the first time you lose access to your (93:00 - 93:05)
moves and they're replaced with (93:03 - 93:08)
different moves so the first time you do (93:05 - 93:10)
that if you weren't planning for that to (93:08 - 93:12)
happen suddenly like if you're like I (93:10 - 93:14)
was gonna use my X beat a couple you (93:12 - 93:15)
know one more time but I'll do that (93:14 - 93:19)
after my sync you lose access to EXPEED (93:15 - 93:20)
when you do that you also lose access to (93:19 - 93:22)
the other ability it has a world of (93:20 - 93:25)
dreams they disappear and are replaced (93:22 - 93:28)
by different moves so it's cool the (93:25 - 93:29)
first time but also (93:28 - 93:33)
like oh I really should have used all (93:29 - 93:36)
those things before I got here (93:33 - 93:38)
oh sorry did it didn't warn me that I (93:36 - 93:39)
was suddenly gonna be faced with (93:38 - 93:41)
completely different moves and none of (93:39 - 93:43)
them are buffing moves they're all (93:41 - 93:45)
attack moves then depending on who (93:43 - 93:47)
you're fighting month at many of them (93:45 - 93:50)
aren't gonna be worth it it's I was (93:47 - 93:51)
surprised that oak started as a three (93:50 - 93:56)
star it seems underwhelming to have it (93:51 - 93:58)
be the lowest level (93:56 - 94:01)
of stars like oh okay (93:58 - 94:04)
and then I have to use items that I've (94:01 - 94:06)
gotten only through summoning or by (94:04 - 94:09)
spending my other event tickets in very (94:06 - 94:13)
specific ways to be able to power up to (94:09 - 94:15)
four stars and then I have to do all (94:13 - 94:17)
that again to try to get oak to five (94:15 - 94:19)
stars I think all the star stuff is so (94:17 - 94:23)
weird and misleading like there's no (94:19 - 94:25)
water two stars and it's light you can (94:23 - 94:27)
get a three star to be a five star but (94:25 - 94:30)
people only care about five stars (94:27 - 94:31)
yeah well because the five stars have (94:30 - 94:34)
frankly just better stats like there's (94:31 - 94:36)
no denying that if you're gonna use oak (94:34 - 94:38)
you want to get it to five stars to get (94:36 - 94:43)
access to it being a powerhouse the sort (94:38 - 94:47)
of issue is that so where I am in the (94:43 - 94:51)
game having to go back and do level one (94:47 - 94:55)
normal level courses things that when I (94:51 - 94:57)
pop in there it says you need a power (94:55 - 94:59)
level of two thousand and my team is (94:57 - 95:03)
twenty thousand I still have to go (94:59 - 95:05)
through the two minutes of running this (95:03 - 95:08)
battle because that's the mission that I (95:05 - 95:10)
have to complete and I have to complete (95:08 - 95:13)
that five times and there's no challenge (95:10 - 95:15)
it's just me literally saying click here (95:13 - 95:17)
and then I set down my phone for two (95:15 - 95:20)
minutes and then come back and it's done (95:17 - 95:24)
and I have to do that a lot of times on (95:20 - 95:27)
each level and ultimately I just started (95:24 - 95:29)
going back and saying who do I have it (95:27 - 95:31)
like level ten that I don't care about (95:29 - 95:33)
that I'm just gonna throw in there so (95:31 - 95:34)
that I have something to do to make this (95:33 - 95:36)
interesting that I'm not just (95:34 - 95:38)
steamrolling this content because I'm (95:36 - 95:41)
not allowed to skip it I have to do it (95:38 - 95:44)
to power up oak and Moo because there's (95:41 - 95:46)
no way I can't use any of my other items (95:44 - 95:50)
I can't use my regular stuff to power up (95:46 - 95:53)
mu I have to do these I know I have to (95:50 - 95:56)
do these missions and the missions that (95:53 - 95:59)
I have to do the first 40 of them were (95:56 - 96:00)
no challenge at all it was just me (95:59 - 96:04)
literally reading my email and then when (96:00 - 96:05)
I saw that the animations finished (96:04 - 96:08)
hitting battle again hit Auto because (96:05 - 96:10)
there was no way I could possibly lose I (96:08 - 96:12)
was so over power (96:10 - 96:15)
but then you realize way down in the (96:12 - 96:17)
list that you have to attack with muse (96:15 - 96:20)
psychic 70 times to get one of the (96:17 - 96:24)
things and it's like okay so I have to (96:20 - 96:28)
find one that allows me to survive use (96:24 - 96:32)
muse psychic 70 times use muse synch (96:28 - 96:34)
move like think like 20 times I found (96:32 - 96:39)
right there drag and so the challenge is (96:34 - 96:42)
surviving the grind and that's a real (96:39 - 96:44)
tough challenge to be honest because (96:42 - 96:48)
it's not it's not particularly fun to do (96:44 - 96:50)
that like I'm not getting a new story (96:48 - 96:52)
I'm not like when I was doing the grass (96:50 - 96:55)
event and when I was doing the the (96:52 - 96:57)
zinnia event like there was a storyline (96:55 - 96:59)
to do that and like I was moving up (96:57 - 97:00)
through things and I was inform things (96:59 - 97:02)
professor oak just shows up and it's (97:00 - 97:05)
like do all your old content but now (97:02 - 97:08)
with professor oak and mu and it's like (97:05 - 97:09)
this is content that I've been playing (97:08 - 97:14)
ever since this game has come out I have (97:09 - 97:16)
done all of these hundreds of hundreds (97:14 - 97:18)
and times and now I have to do them (97:16 - 97:21)
again in this short window to be able to (97:18 - 97:24)
use this character effectively and to (97:21 - 97:28)
their max potential it's not bad the (97:24 - 97:30)
first ten times I did it but like I'm on (97:28 - 97:35)
I think I have to do very hard levels (97:30 - 97:38)
forty times after you the same thing (97:35 - 97:41)
forty times in a row to max it out and (97:38 - 97:44)
there's no challenge there I will blow (97:41 - 97:46)
through it I have done this very hard (97:44 - 97:49)
level already 50 times I just now have (97:46 - 97:52)
to sit and actually interface with the (97:49 - 97:54)
game because I can't trust Auto at those (97:52 - 97:57)
levels to do it well and I have to do it (97:54 - 97:59)
40 (97:57 - 98:05)
times and it's just it's hard for me who (97:59 - 98:09)
have who know that grinding isn't good (98:05 - 98:11)
content grinding is just extending time (98:09 - 98:13)
that I have to interact with your game (98:11 - 98:17)
and it's not more fun more grind isn't (98:13 - 98:20)
more fun for me it's just a grunt so my (98:17 - 98:22)
question is this is definitely different (98:20 - 98:25)
than the last (98:22 - 98:27)
the Rayquaza stuff absolutely it's (98:25 - 98:29)
completely different yet (98:27 - 98:30)
alright bar you saying you like the rick (98:29 - 98:33)
ways and stuff more i know they're both (98:30 - 98:36)
rindy like that's obvious but there was (98:33 - 98:38)
like a progression with the Rayquaza (98:36 - 98:40)
stuff and then you hit a similar grind (98:38 - 98:42)
and I think that's the biggest problem (98:40 - 98:44)
with the game because towards the end of (98:42 - 98:48)
the require event I had to do clear team (98:44 - 98:52)
break option through or whatever yeah 20 (98:48 - 98:54)
times to get past the first bingo and (98:52 - 98:57)
I'm like I don't enjoy this fight enough (98:54 - 98:59)
I did it ten times and at the end of the (98:57 - 99:02)
ten times I'm like I'm so tired of doing (98:59 - 99:06)
this and Rick ways it isn't worth it (99:02 - 99:08)
like this is not a good sync pair it's (99:06 - 99:11)
an oak casing pair but it's not good by (99:08 - 99:14)
any means why am I doing this and it's (99:11 - 99:17)
really early to tell if mu will be worth (99:14 - 99:21)
it the randomness that mu adds is (99:17 - 99:25)
interesting I can't tell if that is (99:21 - 99:27)
going to be good for the game going (99:25 - 99:30)
forward since you have very little (99:27 - 99:32)
control over what happens yeah (99:30 - 99:35)
it's sort of like do I take this risk (99:32 - 99:38)
and hope it works out in our favor or do (99:35 - 99:41)
I go with Olivia who gives a constant (99:38 - 99:46)
steady predictable ramping element that (99:41 - 99:48)
is trustworthy I don't know the answer (99:46 - 99:51)
that we're still very into it but um (99:48 - 99:53)
like it was fun to see like I haven't (99:51 - 99:54)
done the sync stories all their sync (99:53 - 99:56)
stories are charming so that'll be fine (99:54 - 99:58)
yeah that's like the best part of (99:56 - 99:59)
masters is like the characters (99:58 - 100:02)
interacting the Steven stone in Wallis (99:59 - 100:03)
event which is super fun and it's fun to (100:02 - 100:05)
see them interact is sort of like this (100:03 - 100:07)
weird (100:05 - 100:11)
story while Miu is there and it's sort (100:07 - 100:12)
of like hey here's the musing that you (100:11 - 100:15)
want but you're getting no story here's (100:12 - 100:17)
this even stone and Wallis story that's (100:15 - 100:19)
really fun to read and their (100:17 - 100:22)
interactions are great but you have to (100:19 - 100:24)
randomly hopefully get Steven stone in (100:22 - 100:26)
one of your poles oh and Barrett berry (100:24 - 100:30)
knows yeah I love the like reference of (100:26 - 100:34)
like oh those two are yep they're (100:30 - 100:36)
definitely a couple they're definitely a (100:34 - 100:39)
couple it was very cool like we out we (100:36 - 100:41)
for some reason every time we come up (100:39 - 100:42)
bring up masters we always talk about (100:41 - 100:44)
this huge crime and we never talk about (100:42 - 100:46)
like the nice good things that it's (100:44 - 100:48)
doing which is like I will say that like (100:46 - 100:50)
the story moments are fantastic like I (100:48 - 100:53)
loved the Steven stone sorry you got to (100:50 - 100:55)
use Steven stone even if you don't have (100:53 - 100:57)
him in your party the interactions are (100:55 - 101:01)
charming Steven stone asking slightly (100:57 - 101:04)
sketchy questions about the stones in (101:01 - 101:07)
the rock leaders gym what is his name (101:04 - 101:10)
clay yeah (101:07 - 101:12)
like that part was real weird like who (101:10 - 101:14)
tell me about the stoats in your hair at (101:12 - 101:16)
least he didn't ask to touch his hair (101:14 - 101:18)
play you're talking about the guy from (101:16 - 101:22)
X&Y the rock farmer got away name I have (101:18 - 101:24)
died don't remember what his name is you (101:22 - 101:25)
love X&Y (101:24 - 101:28)
I do that doesn't mean I remember the (101:25 - 101:31)
name of every gym leader oh man I have (101:28 - 101:33)
to look it up because it's gonna pick (101:31 - 101:35)
cliff I feel like it's grant grant it's (101:33 - 101:38)
grant rights grant that's a little like (101:35 - 101:42)
ooh don't don't ask don't ask one of the (101:38 - 101:46)
few person of colors NPC about well how (101:42 - 101:48)
they do their hair white boy like please (101:46 - 101:56)
don't yeah those things are fun like the (101:48 - 101:58)
thing that's deceptive about masters is (101:56 - 102:02)
the introduction is fun like it's fun to (101:58 - 102:04)
see them it's fun to hear them they do (102:02 - 102:05)
voice great voice acting when they (102:04 - 102:07)
create a story the story is fun when the (102:05 - 102:10)
sync pair off stuff is fun that's all (102:07 - 102:12)
fun and then you get to the end of it (102:10 - 102:14)
and it's like well we don't have (102:12 - 102:16)
something coming up for awhile so just (102:14 - 102:19)
grind I mean I've had meetings with DNA (102:16 - 102:23)
and I think I'm not speaking for DNA but (102:19 - 102:24)
I think they're still trying to figure (102:23 - 102:27)
out right that balance and you can see (102:24 - 102:29)
them in the game like you don't have to (102:27 - 102:32)
talk to DNA to like realize like every (102:29 - 102:33)
time they've done this event first it (102:32 - 102:35)
was Mewtwo and then they came out and (102:33 - 102:36)
they apologized that Mewtwo was to (102:35 - 102:38)
grindy and they said they would make it (102:36 - 102:40)
easier and for the most part the soul (102:38 - 102:42)
gaia'leo event which I think was the (102:40 - 102:44)
second one people were like this is way (102:42 - 102:46)
better yes but not perfect and then (102:44 - 102:49)
Rayquaza event they added the bingo (102:46 - 102:52)
stuff yeah so they listened and they (102:49 - 102:54)
they tried something different and now (102:52 - 102:57)
this new event well I haven't done it (102:54 - 102:59)
yet what Gregg explained made sense of (102:57 - 103:02)
like okay now this is different yeah so (102:59 - 103:04)
they're they've they they didn't they (103:02 - 103:05)
haven't done the same thing every - (103:04 - 103:07)
they're trying right they're trying and (103:05 - 103:09)
I think they will eventually get there (103:07 - 103:11)
the problem is that they really are (103:09 - 103:14)
relying on a lot of things grinding so (103:11 - 103:17)
like I'll explain this so at the same (103:14 - 103:19)
time that this is happening there is a (103:17 - 103:22)
Master Hunter event happening in their (103:19 - 103:23)
direct competitor (103:22 - 103:26)
gah Gilles sorry Alice listeners and (103:23 - 103:30)
both to do the end content to do the (103:26 - 103:32)
high end raids you don't get to skip (103:30 - 103:35)
that you have to do them so I will (103:32 - 103:39)
freely admit there is a grind in regalia (103:35 - 103:44)
lost to do the high end content but only (103:39 - 103:49)
the high end content so I can't skip the (103:44 - 103:53)
expert level of the what's the big (103:49 - 103:56)
dragons wrangles breathless like I don't (103:53 - 104:00)
get to skip that great but I also don't (103:56 - 104:03)
have to go back to the lower levels and (104:00 - 104:06)
completely place through those levels to (104:03 - 104:07)
get the ability to power up the (104:06 - 104:10)
characters that they introduced to this (104:07 - 104:13)
event so when I pulled that person I (104:10 - 104:16)
then didn't have to go back and say I (104:13 - 104:19)
have to run the leveling up thing I got (104:16 - 104:22)
to skip that I got to say I just need (104:19 - 104:24)
things to get this person to a place (104:22 - 104:26)
where I can play with them and I think (104:24 - 104:30)
that's the difference like if I had the (104:26 - 104:32)
ability to skip the lower levels of the (104:30 - 104:34)
mute ickett part and only have to do the (104:32 - 104:37)
high levels it wouldn't feel so bad yeah (104:34 - 104:40)
but the fact that I have to go so far (104:37 - 104:43)
back and I don't have a way to just say (104:40 - 104:45)
I've done this let me pass this part I (104:43 - 104:48)
don't mind having to do the tough part (104:45 - 104:50)
on my own I don't mind having to do the (104:48 - 104:52)
co-op stuff that is just a given that (104:50 - 104:54)
you shouldn't be able to skip past the (104:52 - 104:55)
hard content (104:54 - 104:59)
let me get past the easy content don't (104:55 - 105:03)
make me do easy things because it's it's (104:59 - 105:04)
not hiding the fact that it's just (105:03 - 105:06)
filler (105:04 - 105:08)
because I've done that and people who (105:06 - 105:10)
are leveling up have to do that great (105:08 - 105:12)
they don't have they don't get to skip (105:10 - 105:14)
because that is the highest level (105:12 - 105:16)
content that they have to do and I think (105:14 - 105:18)
that's the difference between the two (105:16 - 105:21)
games why I don't hate doing the grind (105:18 - 105:24)
replaying the Rathalos fight and the (105:21 - 105:26)
other rare super extra dragon to be on (105:24 - 105:29)
that fight because the rest of the game (105:26 - 105:32)
I get to just say I've done this and I'm (105:29 - 105:33)
past it and I can focus on the thing (105:32 - 105:36)
that I want to do the new hard content (105:33 - 105:39)
and with masters not only do I not have (105:36 - 105:42)
do it not just have to focus on the hard (105:39 - 105:44)
content but I have to do all of the easy (105:42 - 105:49)
content as well and I have to spend a (105:44 - 105:52)
lot of time in there like doing easy (105:49 - 105:54)
raid five times sounds like well that's (105:52 - 105:56)
nothing that's only ten minutes if I (105:54 - 105:58)
only had ten minutes to play a mobile (105:56 - 106:01)
game like that's a lot of time for a (105:58 - 106:04)
mobile game to eat up my time like I (106:01 - 106:06)
have to date it and that's just step one (106:04 - 106:09)
I think that is where some of my (106:06 - 106:11)
discomfort with masters comes in because (106:09 - 106:14)
they at this point they do a lot of (106:11 - 106:16)
things right like we're getting enough (106:14 - 106:18)
gems that when you pull up when you have (106:16 - 106:20)
a bad poll it's not as soul-crushing (106:18 - 106:22)
anymore because you're getting gems on a (106:20 - 106:24)
more regular basis I still think they (106:22 - 106:26)
should guarantee a four star if you're (106:24 - 106:28)
doing a ten poll but that's splitting (106:26 - 106:31)
hairs the characters that they put in (106:28 - 106:33)
are all charming they all make sense the (106:31 - 106:36)
voice work is amazing it's a charming (106:33 - 106:39)
game that's dragged down by their (106:36 - 106:42)
inability to give up this idea that the (106:39 - 106:44)
only way to interact with their game is (106:42 - 106:47)
to grind everything else is great and it (106:44 - 106:50)
could be such a top-tier game if they (106:47 - 106:52)
could just let that go (106:50 - 106:55)
yeah I'm not sure if that's like we have (106:52 - 106:58)
to rework something in the backend or I (106:55 - 107:00)
mean it probably is and I'm not saying (106:58 - 107:02)
it's an easy fix but it is when I when I (107:00 - 107:04)
sit down in my morning break and I'm (107:02 - 107:06)
reading my email at work and I think I (107:04 - 107:09)
have to got two games in front of me (107:06 - 107:12)
which I want to go my immediate reaction (107:09 - 107:15)
when I look at masters is I just can't (107:12 - 107:17)
handle that grind right now I'm gonna go (107:15 - 107:20)
to the other one and (107:17 - 107:23)
I have such a stronger attachment to (107:20 - 107:25)
Pokemon my instincts are to play that (107:23 - 107:27)
one because I love that universe I love (107:25 - 107:29)
those characters I love the way it's (107:27 - 107:35)
presented but I just know that half of (107:29 - 107:37)
my experience isn't going to be fun (107:35 - 107:40)
whereas I can go to drag a Yost and I (107:37 - 107:41)
have no attachment to this characters (107:40 - 107:43)
they're all new to me and there's ones (107:41 - 107:47)
that I love and I know I can spend the (107:43 - 107:49)
exact same ten minutes between the two (107:47 - 107:51)
games and I will get a hundred percent (107:49 - 107:54)
more out of the one that I will the (107:51 - 107:56)
other and that's just a problem in that (107:54 - 107:58)
marketplace (107:56 - 108:01)
but I will say this they are definitely (107:58 - 108:02)
trying to prove the game that's what (108:01 - 108:04)
keeps me coming back I know they are (108:02 - 108:06)
working hard like I can already tell (108:04 - 108:09)
that they have made a lot of changes and (108:06 - 108:11)
a lot of those changes are good like I (108:09 - 108:13)
am no longer in the camp of saying don't (108:11 - 108:16)
play Pokemon masters I am in the camp of (108:13 - 108:18)
play it but it's not gonna be your (108:16 - 108:20)
number one game because once you've (108:18 - 108:22)
completed all the fun stuff then that (108:20 - 108:25)
fun stuff starts but it is a better game (108:22 - 108:28)
than it was when it started and I think (108:25 - 108:31)
I think they are getting to a a good (108:28 - 108:33)
place with it I just think there are (108:31 - 108:36)
some there are some design things that I (108:33 - 108:39)
don't agree with and I don't know I (108:36 - 108:42)
don't know their thinking behind it so (108:39 - 108:44)
these are just my my thoughts about yeah (108:42 - 108:46)
like and and professor oka me is fun (108:44 - 108:49)
like I like using them and they're like (108:46 - 108:51)
that all their interactions are cute but (108:49 - 108:54)
it's still like okay here we go (108:51 - 108:57)
how you gonna sit down like I really (108:54 - 108:59)
tried to burn through it on when it (108:57 - 109:00)
first came out and I was like two hours (108:59 - 109:02)
in and I was nowhere near completing (109:00 - 109:04)
everything I'm like I gotta be done this (109:02 - 109:06)
is this is makin oh this is this is (109:04 - 109:11)
rough well you can finish the me stuff (109:06 - 109:13)
just by spending money Greg true which (109:11 - 109:17)
will never happen no III have I like (109:13 - 109:20)
masters but I am I'm definitely like I (109:17 - 109:24)
do my dailies and that's kind of it and (109:20 - 109:25)
I have a good time with that I'm just (109:24 - 109:28)
like okay cuz every day the what is it (109:25 - 109:31)
the daily Scout things switch yep yeah (109:28 - 109:33)
and that's pretty much all i do i do my (109:31 - 109:36)
dailies I get my new characters and I (109:33 - 109:38)
move on but I know some people are they (109:36 - 109:40)
want to get all their characters up to (109:38 - 109:43)
120 they want the every move unlocked (109:40 - 109:45)
which is totally fair way to play it's (109:43 - 109:50)
just I I'm not that hardcore yeah we (109:45 - 109:51)
need to get back (109:50 - 109:54)
we need to resuscitate will back into (109:51 - 109:57)
into life is I've been listening to this (109:54 - 109:59)
whole thing and I'm keep evaluating (109:57 - 110:00)
whether I'm gonna start playing this (109:59 - 110:02)
game or not you don't have to start well (110:00 - 110:03)
you just have to log in every day to get (110:02 - 110:05)
your gems and then if you decide to (110:03 - 110:07)
start playing you'll be like wow I have (110:05 - 110:10)
30,000 gems I can pull to my heart's (110:07 - 110:12)
content right I have (110:10 - 110:14)
34,000 gems right now because the last (110:12 - 110:19)
time I pulled was Cynthia and I was able (110:14 - 110:21)
to get Cynthia very easily so sometimes (110:19 - 110:23)
as we know I'm so mad and I find that I (110:21 - 110:27)
really just got Karen so sometimes I (110:23 - 110:28)
don't think I have Karen so sometimes (110:27 - 110:29)
this week I'm gonna try to pull for (110:28 - 110:33)
first Steven stone and his gayness (110:29 - 110:35)
really comes out in this game which I (110:33 - 110:35)
love (110:35 - 110:38)
yeah I love it also a lot of people are (110:35 - 110:40)
like I'm gonna wait for the six month (110:38 - 110:43)
because if red and whatever else is (110:40 - 110:46)
coming as a poll that's sort of that (110:43 - 110:47)
sort of a thing that people are talking (110:46 - 110:49)
about like I don't want to pull for (110:47 - 110:52)
Steven stone because we know the big (110:49 - 110:54)
thing is coming oh yeah but if I do get (110:52 - 110:56)
Steven stone in one poll then you save (110:54 - 110:58)
your gems for red yeah I haven't I (110:56 - 111:03)
didn't I didn't even get Cynthia so bite (110:58 - 111:05)
me (111:03 - 111:05)
okay okay okay uh question of the week (111:06 - 111:14)
Greg all right are you ready I'm ready (111:10 - 111:17)
is this be topical okay when I think of (111:14 - 111:20)
home I think of a place where there are (111:17 - 111:24)
Pokemon overflowing I'll put this one (111:20 - 111:27)
there I'll send that one someplace well (111:24 - 111:32)
I have no way of knowing is this worth (111:27 - 111:36)
the money that I'm paying is this all (111:32 - 111:39)
worse than people are saying surprise (111:36 - 111:44)
trades are still bleak let's just hear (111:39 - 111:52)
the question of the week there's an (111:44 - 111:54)
effort put into this one I mean there's (111:52 - 111:56)
that for denial except for yeah (111:54 - 112:02)
that's rude go Brandon says do you have (111:56 - 112:05)
any stories or really cool of a really (112:02 - 112:07)
cool or memorable Pokemon that you (112:05 - 112:09)
forgotten about with home releasing I (112:07 - 112:15)
found three shiny volcanic son game when (112:09 - 112:17)
I saw them I left and I remembered I got (112:15 - 112:19)
them from buying a copy of son on eBay (112:17 - 112:22)
and realized they were a hacked that's (112:19 - 112:25)
actually a really good story I mean yes (112:22 - 112:29)
I just went into a copy of X that I (112:25 - 112:33)
found that I had hidden in one of I had (112:29 - 112:36)
put it in my ultramoon case and I (112:33 - 112:37)
realized that there was a person (112:36 - 112:39)
standing at the counter when I went in (112:37 - 112:41)
there like oh I've never collected any (112:39 - 112:44)
of these mystery gifts so he'd spent 10 (112:41 - 112:46)
minutes clicking you like your party's (112:44 - 112:48)
full all right drop them all and come (112:46 - 112:50)

oh I mean I forgot because I have two (112:53 - 113:00)
copies of X I forgot I had two copies of (112:56 - 113:05)
X because I clearly had 102 copies of X (113:00 - 113:10)
I wanted to do a Nuzlocke and I didn't (113:05 - 113:14)
want to reset X and I think target was (113:10 - 113:17)
having a sale like buy one get one free (113:14 - 113:19)
so I had a different game that I bought (113:17 - 113:22)
I'm like well just pick up X for free (113:19 - 113:25)
and so I did and like I'll just run this (113:22 - 113:26)
and then I promptly forgot that I did (113:25 - 113:29)
that and put it into a case hmm so I've (113:26 - 113:32)
been fine it was a Steve move cuz you (113:29 - 113:33)

people just don't wanna play pokemon go (115:21 - 115:25)
and it's funny cuz people because it's (115:22 - 115:26)
like you can open a melt an box every (115:25 - 115:28)
three days and right now it's double (115:26 - 115:30)
candy by the time this podcast goes up (115:28 - 115:32)
it's still double candy if you're (115:30 - 115:33)
listening to it on Monday morning and (115:32 - 115:36)
that ends at 10:00 p.m. so you can (115:33 - 115:39)
catch 18 melt hands with double candy (115:36 - 115:43)
and and pin at berries and get close I (115:39 - 115:45)
have like four or five Mel medals I'm (115:43 - 115:47)
not missing any any mythical z-- but (115:45 - 115:49)
that's a fair trip that's actually a (115:47 - 115:51)
fair trade like hey I will trade you up (115:49 - 115:55)
Victini for a ML medal I do have a shiny (115:51 - 115:59)
male medal so that's a special ooh the (115:55 - 116:01)
the thing that I guess stands out for me (115:59 - 116:05)
is I spent a lot of time shiny hunting (116:01 - 116:09)
and ultrason all Turman and at one point (116:05 - 116:13)
I have cared about ribbons which there's (116:09 - 116:16)
now a ribbon guide on YouTube that I put (116:13 - 116:18)
up unfortunately it got damaged so it (116:16 - 116:20)
only uploaded a 480 version so I'm real (116:18 - 116:23)
upset about that but people are still (116:20 - 116:25)
happy with it but there's a guide on (116:23 - 116:27)
YouTube of how I specifically mark stuff (116:25 - 116:29)
which revolves around ribbons and (116:27 - 116:31)
Chinese and Eevee training and IV (116:29 - 116:35)
training but I was able to get about 30 (116:31 - 116:37)
shinies that I really cared about in (116:35 - 116:39)
ultrasone all tremendous many ribbons on (116:37 - 116:42)
them as I could and move them into (116:39 - 116:44)
Pokemon home and now almost all those (116:42 - 116:47)
Pokemon can go into a sword and shield (116:44 - 116:50)
so I can get the I think there are six (116:47 - 116:51)
or seven ribbons and sword and shield (116:50 - 116:53)
that I can now put on those Pokemon (116:51 - 116:57)
which I'm excited to do so and then of (116:53 - 117:00)
course my scraggy from the 2011 World (116:57 - 117:02)
Championships crafty sorry that I really (117:00 - 117:04)
really care about is is safe and sound (117:02 - 117:08)
in Pokemon home gay so that's now if you (117:04 - 117:10)
could only find it no I know where it is (117:08 - 117:15)
I know it is a real quick before we (117:10 - 117:18)
moved to Pokemon of the week in regards (117:15 - 117:20)
to Grand Oak this is actually a quote (117:18 - 117:22)
from Game Informer I'm not sure how long (117:20 - 117:24)
ago but (117:22 - 117:27)
Game Informer asked what's the deal with (117:24 - 117:29)
the Pokemon timeline and Masuda said it (117:27 - 117:31)
starts to get a little complicated if (117:29 - 117:33)
you pay too much attention to timelines (117:31 - 117:35)
like there might be a professor that (117:33 - 117:37)
appears and it wouldn't make sense at (117:35 - 117:39)
all if we applied it to some kind of (117:37 - 117:42)
timeline logic so we not we try not to (117:39 - 117:44)
apply it to regular rigorously maybe (117:42 - 117:47)
like one hint is that a character is (117:44 - 117:49)
appearing with Professor Oak they're (117:47 - 117:50)
living in the same (117:49 - 117:52)
error rather than some series where it (117:50 - 117:54)
makes sense to have a time line progress (117:52 - 117:56)
as you go and the story evolve the (117:54 - 117:59)
approach that Pokemon takes is an expand (117:56 - 118:01)
is expanding the world like what regions (117:59 - 118:03)
are and making it richer as we go rather (118:01 - 118:05)
than a time line it's more of a physical (118:03 - 118:08)
space thing that's like a non-answer (118:05 - 118:12)
yeah no I mean they did the thing where (118:08 - 118:14)
Zelda should have done and say like hey (118:12 - 118:16)
maybe the time line doesn't matter too (118:14 - 118:19)
much but Zelda fans were like no it must (118:16 - 118:21)
matter and it's like did better (118:19 - 118:24)
yeah I don't know they really messed up (118:21 - 118:26)
like it kind of the Pokemon timeline (118:24 - 118:28)
kind of made sense until Omega Ruby (118:26 - 118:30)
alpha sapphire and they were like ah (118:28 - 118:32)
well now all of a sudden Wallace has a (118:30 - 118:34)
mega and we're gonna wreak on his (118:32 - 118:36)
pokemon from Gardevoir to make a goal a (118:34 - 118:41)
heat it's fine though they gave guard (118:36 - 118:43)
ported (118:41 - 118:45)

I've been seeing him in raids (123:01 - 123:07)
floatin now I don't pay attention to (123:04 - 123:09)
raids (123:07 - 123:09)
our point of the week it's almost a (123:09 - 123:12)
three-hour show I got to figure out how (123:11 - 123:18)
to cut an hour from this there has (123:12 - 123:20)
recently recently been a lot of talk in (123:18 - 123:23)
the Pokemon go communities about trade (123:20 - 123:25)
evolutions these are pokemons that only (123:23 - 123:28)
evolve when they are traded this concept (123:25 - 123:30)
has existed since the very first Pokemon (123:28 - 123:33)
games but it has also taken on varying (123:30 - 123:36)
forms the Pokemon that currently benefit (123:33 - 123:39)
from trade evolution in Pokemon go are (123:36 - 123:43)
Kadabra Machoke gravel ER hunter bull (123:39 - 123:46)
door girder kara blast and shell mitt (123:43 - 123:48)
most of these represent the standard (123:46 - 123:51)
trade evolution just trade them and when (123:48 - 123:52)
they appear on the other side they begin (123:51 - 123:55)
to evolve in the Pokemon video games (123:52 - 123:58)
Kara blastin shellman would only evolve (123:55 - 124:00)
if you traded one for the other a unique (123:58 - 124:03)
situation there are other types of trade (124:00 - 124:05)
evolutions though that are not currently (124:03 - 124:07)
available in Pokemon go and that have (124:05 - 124:09)
recently been brought to mind by my (124:07 - 124:12)
experiences using Invisalign how much (124:09 - 124:14)
happier I would be if I could just get (124:12 - 124:16)
my teeth to evolve to the final straight (124:14 - 124:19)
form some examples of varying trade (124:16 - 124:22)
evolutions include onyx to steelix which (124:19 - 124:25)
evolves when traded with a metal coat or (124:22 - 124:27)
right on to our IP riyer which evolves (124:25 - 124:29)
when holding a protector (124:27 - 124:31)
this week's Pokemon is a result of this (124:29 - 124:34)
type of trade evolution as I mentioned (124:31 - 124:36)
my experiences with Invisalign had me (124:34 - 124:38)
thinking of the deep-sea tooth an item (124:36 - 124:41)
that when held by Clamperl allows it to (124:38 - 124:43)
evolve into one of its two final forms (124:41 - 124:45)
if you choose to have Clamperl hold the (124:43 - 124:47)
deep-sea tooth before evolving it will (124:45 - 124:51)
double Clamperl special attack you may (124:47 - 124:53)
or may not be aware that Pokemon have (124:51 - 124:55)
various leveling rates plant pearl and (124:53 - 124:57)
it's evolutions all follow the erratic (124:55 - 125:00)
leveling rate this rate allows pokémon (124:57 - 125:02)
to evolve the fastest of all leveling (125:00 - 125:05)
rates there you go little easy one this (125:02 - 125:08)
