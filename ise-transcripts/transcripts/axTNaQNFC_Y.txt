[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the Wyss my voice so raspy what's up everyone welcome to be 396 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host s BJ we were just talking for like 20 minutes and my voice just suddenly became super raspy Gregg is here hello it is I from the frozen north surviving sub sub-zero temperatures to bring you the the latest pokemon news everyone's favorite pokemon trainer will is awesome I forgot who I introduced well I guess I'm at the southern part of the frozen north because this winter has been incredibly disappointing I was looking for negative 60s out here and the worst that we've got is negative 10 well wind chills now 31 bear we have had a mild we have a mild winter we all made the agreement they make it a mild winter for your first winter so that you wouldn't get scared off and you wouldn't go outside and be like oh let me find you frozen in a snowbank we did this to be nice to you well this is the thanks we get it's backfiring because now I'm bored and I'm gonna move someplace colder Winnipeg I'm on my way moved in Medicine Hat before I moved to Winnipeg you got that right even in Winnipeg Ian's we got a we got a we got a heck of a show for you guys you probably can figure out by the title of this episode but pokemon home is now available I mean I'm in love with it but it is there's there's a couple problems not the price because well the price is fine there's the project is not fine the price is fine for me Greg rich for you it is not a fine price don't you know once you get into podcasting you're just living in mansions with Mike Wayne nice for that light to go off in my wife since since will and I have never seen our is a paycheck come through yeah you are living in a mansion off of our sweat equity oh yeah well well let's LSU know when we upgrade the mansion oh yeah I mean I've been to the I've been to the fake mansion aka your home boy okay so we got Pokemon Pokemon home stuff we have a new more Funko nice more fun canoes we have some Pokemon masters news we have Pokemon Go news but in an update it's not actually a Pokemon go event its knee antic got caught false advertising in the UK which i think is really interesting that's against the law in Europe yeah well it's against the law in the European Union so they got right in that loophole yeah Briggs it's gonna bite you in the butt UK look at this topical humor we have a we we forgot to cover this last week so hold on forget Pokemon go put one home Eevee and friends Pokemon masters we are going to start off today's show with some good stuff Oh also we got the new mythical Pokemon coming but we already talked about that we have a silhouette Wolverine Wolverine is coming but we're gonna come in we're gonna start the x-men masters crossover even craving start off this week from an article from Newsweek which not trustworthy apparently is not trustworthy anymore but titled Pokemon sword and shield leaker revealed oh yeah via Nintendo lawsuit hopefully this was the best article here I like to pull articles that have updated that's like a that's like what drags me it's because there's one thing to post news but when you come back and you go oh we got an update on this news I'm all in games I sit there on top of it and they're Google or went off Google Alerts yeah even work anymore sure I think it does I think that's what Joe from peers is like you they have like hot words key words when breaking that's why they're so fascinating okay so if you--if you guys do not recall it's been three months since sword and shield have released before the release of Pokemon sword and shield November information was leaked showing new Pokemon forms and more the flood of unofficial information became so pervasive that Nintendo and the Pokemon company felt it was necessary to file a lawsuit against said leaker or irreparable injury irreparable irreparable is okay irreparable is also okay okay I'm not a lawyer so I don't dumb it down is that they're saying like we're suing you for things that have hurt our reputation is what I uh it's it's not reputation it's just the issues have done damage to me and there's nothing you can ready to reverse that damage so you have to pay a penalty right like there's no weight like there's no way to undo the leaks you did and there's no way to take that knowledge back so you can't repair the situation you guys damaged us in a way that cannot be fixed so somebody out there is going to determine what the financial impact of the leaks were and then you have to pay us that much because that's the financial equivalent of the damage that you caused us Tuesday actually when the article came out so this came out like a week go so this would be last Tuesday Tuesday both companies went to the website to I went to look at the bad people app Tuesday both companies released a joint statement revealing they identified an outlet that broke embargo by posting images and information online leading up to the game's release f Nintendo yeah a Portuguese giving website Nintendo was the identifying outlet and such Nintendo discovered to sever all ties with them so the F in F Nintendo is supposed to stand for forum so it's like a Nintendo forum but I guess now that has a more literal meaning yep it should be noted that the lawsuit was filed against the parties who used the strategy guide to release information and this new development will likely not affect it they have reached out to the Pokemon opening for clarification here's the full statement from Nintendo and the Pokemon company an early in early November so sorry sorry so this is the statement quote in early wait do I have a Nintendo voice no I don't yeah in early November Nintendo identified a number of photographs taken from the gameplay that revealed multiple new and unannounced Pokemon from Pokemon sword and Pokemon shield these photographs have been posted online and Nintendo together with the Pokemon company quickly identified the person responsible for these leaks and immediately took action these Pokemon were released by a reviewer of a Portuguese website named death Nintendo who had received an early copy of the game for review purposes both he and F Nintendo failed to handle confidential matter resulting in a clear breach of confidentiality agreement between Nintendo and a media outlet as a result in attend alonger work with F Nintendo Nintendo will always protect its intellectual properties and brands leaks hurt not Nintendo but thousands of employees who work hard to bring these games to market and millions of fans around the world who look forward to news and surprises to surprise and delight players throughout news experience is a shared passion for Nintendo and the Pokemon company we will always pursue all avenues preserve surprises for players of future Pokemon titles so f Nintendo posted a statement on the matter and they said to our readers in early November of 2019 a series of photographs of screens displaying images of several Pokemon at the time not yet announced from Pokemon sword and shield games were shared online we take the opportunity to openly admit to our readers that F Nintendo was responsible for the online discernment ation of these photos boy I hope I said that right the first time dissemination there was no R in there this is summation dissemination Nintendo offered us a copy of the game for analyst purpose with clear embargo guidelines which we agreed that copy was sent to one of our collaborators who improperly shared photos mentioned after the investigation F M Tendo ended its relationship with that employee our relationship with Nintendo Portugal goes back 11 years but our part in this undo sharing is clear violation the confidential agreement between us and as a result a total breach of trust with Nintendo we recognize that it's inadmissible to violate the embargo guidelines and that we have not handled the materials for analysis with due care we fully respect Nintendo's decision to cancel the confidential confidential agreement between our companies as a result of this breach of trust and we accept that we will no longer receive nintendo products or be invited to participate in events that monka we apologize to Nintendo and the Li Pokemon company as well as our readers for disappointing them and in fire months F Nintendo will be shutting down yeah when you're who I I don't know too much about F no Tendo their actual website was down the day this broke just because so many people were trying to like go to their website and see when you're when you're the main gist of your website is to focus on nintendo stuff and you had an eleven year partnership with nintendo full disclosure to our listeners i have a partnership with Nintendo they only send me games here and there it's not it's not probably anything the extent of like a giant bomb or a game informer or Eurogamer but I mean they can still review games they can still give their inputs they just don't they just won't be able to you know get things early or get things compensated by Nintendo as well as going to advance which I mean they're gonna be behind ya constantly like this is what ultimately kills a website I mean if you can't be on top of it either your content has to be brilliant and from what I understand the content and portugal is lacking almost completely like they were one of the only sites and now they're cut out from it so i i'm assuming they're just done like this was AB male in the coffin yeah they're coming back from there because Portuguese speakers can go to Brazilian sites for their Nintendo news yeah I'm not sure how big they were they they had about 500 followers on Twitter about 500 Facebook Likes if that's how you measure our website probably not but it would make sense for if if that was the biggest you know Portugal website it would make sense for a Nintendo to be like okay well we we've still respect and we still want to do something for our Portugal audience so let's work with this website and if they've been working with that website for 11 years it wouldn't make sense to break off that tie if the relationships were always good if the relationship between them were always good now it's not for the record and it send to Portugal the official Nintendo Portuguese Twitter has 15,000 followers so very tiny but again not to say that audience isn't still important to Nintendo I guess case closed I know they said we acted as quickly as possible it was it took three months but all legal matter is that's three months pad yes three months for legal stuff is actually really fast let's move over since we're in lawsuit town let's move over to the antic here I first saw this on the Silk Road that people were complaining that knee antic said that tickets were I think 18 pounds 18 euros I'm not sure which one it is well that is an important thing yeah they're different again so I first saw myself Road they were saying that the a si is gonna get involved and then lo and behold the next morning this news broke so happy Valentine's Day this is off Eurogamer February 14th Tom Phillips your news editor here who wrote this article our Tom Pokemon go fans contact a si over Liverpool ticket prices price advertizing update and Nintendo apologizes and updates the price knee antic nut Nintendo oh sorry maybe Nintendo sector potatoes like whatever dant ik you're out to dry on this one so as of 6:45 p.m. knee antic did update the pricing for Liverpool's Pokemon go safaris an event ok so let's let's jump let's jump down to the original story here this was at 10:30 a.m. on Valentine's Day Pokemon go fans found their tickets to the UK's first Safari Zone to cost more than expected due to the addition of previously unmentioned tax and fees before checkout liverpool safari zone tickets went on sale at 8 a.m. UK time up until the ticket buying process they were listed for either 12 pounds I think it's pounds cuz it's the like if it looks like an L with the line through it that's a pound yes okay yep twelve pounds per standard ticket or 18 pounds for early access this price is also advertised by nanny antic in its blog post of announcing the event and the in-game news post which does not mention any taxes or fees but reaching the later stages of the tickets in the selection process a three-pound / 4.20 pound charge for tax and a further $3.00 a three pound flat charge for fees then applied this makes the 12 pound standard ticket jump to 18 pounds and the 18 pound early access ticket actually cost 25.20 pounds that's all without the additional city explorer pass which bumps the tax category even higher the 4.6 pounds a stainer ticket and 5.8 pounds or 1 with early access now fans have said they are contacting the UK's Advertising Standards Authority the a sa to state that any antics should have disclosed that they need to pay tax on top of the ticket prices listed this is not the case for the u.s. wearing antic is based but in the UK the si si guidelines on this appear Perce clears exactly rule point three one eight of the CA P code states that quote prices must include non optional taxes duties and fees that charges and charges that apply to most to all or most buyers and quote with the only exception would be for cost of taxpayers who would normally recover v VAT or to those who pay none in the first place neither cat applies to most ticket buyers your gamer has contacted me in the antic and the aasa' we wait for the response fast-forward six hours later moving really fast here the UK advertising standard Authority the a si has confirmed a Eurogamer so far that it received more than 180 complaints about Pokemon goes Liverpool event pricing since the tickets went on sale at 8 a.m. this morning as reported this morning below developer Niantic advertised ticket prices do not include taxes and fees which fans were surprised to find out before they added a check out it doesn't say here in the article but I'm sure all those fans continued to purchase their tickets even though they were upset about the false advertising as we know Pokemon go fans they'll pay $30 for incubators just hopefully hatched one shiny riolu in a statement to Eurogamer the aasa' branded knee antics advertising as misleading and confirmed it's now in contact with the developer quotes we are in the process of contacting the advertiser so we can instruct them to amend their misleading advertisement your gamer has yet to hear back from the antic three hours later Wow knee antic has now updated their ticket pricing for Liverpool's safari zone event quote previous advertising for Pokemon goes safari zone Liverpool tickets did not include the service fees in fact costs in the antic spokesperson told Eurogamer this evening we are updating all the listings today quote the ticket price is now listed as twenty one point six pounds for early access and fourteen point four pounds for general admission a 3.6 pounds service fee has been added to each order up to four per ticket the Exedy Explorer pass add-on is nine point six pounds and all prices are inclusive of that on Twitter antics support account apologized or described a apologize describing the situation as an error I don't know if there's like an a s a penalty I don't know if like Nanta has to pay like a fine for I'm sure they do but it's probably a drop in the bucket when you're making two million dollars a day right it's like probably say like oh you it's $100,000 fine or whatever and they'll be like okay here ever $100,000 dollar pound euro whatever fine that's like one hour of a lucky tongue event a hundred thousand that's gonna be like not a lot it's why a lot of companies do these things because the penalties are nothing to them penalties aside is it is it smarter for them to advertise a lower price when they know they're like fan base is gonna buy tickets I mean no matter how many that that thing that in this case I would believe that they just made a mistake oh this is 100% like a clerical slash we didn't understand that that was the law over there error because in the United States uh nobody has to tell us service charges taxes up front we just expect them Ticketmaster correct we've been trained over years and years of Ticketmaster yeah Ticketmaster is not great is it they're only like isn't they're only like two ticket places in the unites it's like taking master on a live nation it depends on how you define ticket yeah I guess I mean because you can sell tickets through Eventbrite oh yeah I had to help I read by BTS tickets and that was the first time I've used Ticketmaster in like six or seven years it's rough it's pain it is rough I have so much more respect for Niantic for doing the lottery system because even if you're sitting there for like four hours waiting for Ticketmaster to open its queue and it's like telling you not to refresh it's like still a lottery like it's am I going to connect before the other a million people trying to order these tickets like just give me a lottery say that like you won the lottery your time to buy is between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. there's only a hundred other people that will be buying so the server's aren't going to be slammed here's your secret code to get in listen millennial back in my day free internet if you wanted to get tickets that were sold by Ticketmaster you had to know which doors were the Ticketmaster outlets and arbitrarily lined up in the cold hours before the store opened hoping because once again no lottery that you were in line in your store went fast enough that you could get tickets yep that's how it that's how I got second row for Tori Amos is that we went to out of the way we drove to an out-of-the-way Ticketmaster location we got there two hours ahead of their opening we were the third person in line and the two people in front of us wanted different concerts didn't want Tori Amos no no go work it is what it is Mantic apologized and I'm sure holidays pay your slap on the wrist fee three bar do it again no one will remember no one the internet will remember believe me the next time an event comes up it'll be the antic didn't tell Japan about service cherry I'm sure all right is this are the GPO boys going to going to UK's this event sold out defense we're the G field boys by the way just two of us oh yeah well refuses Saturday sold up a Friday and Sunday are available Greg okay so how much taking part of take part of your mentioned money get me a ticket across the sea you gotta you gotta bring a better shipper no Aussie I bet will has an updated passport i sir not yeah i have a passport greg has my application and he keeps conveniently forgetting to bring it to whatever we get together cuz he doesn't want me to leave the country correct if I could stop you from leaving the state I would oh my gosh once you're here you're in my web it you could mail how supposed to go - Pikachu outbreak if you boys don't have your passports ready look it would take me like two seconds to get a passport when is it I picked you outbreak I think is usually an August yeah I can get a passport by August alright alright I mean I won't have my real ID but then cuz Minnesota so far I have to do that next week and I they haven't cleared through october yet she's bad let's take a break we got pokemon home poke my masters Funko and some other stuff got all the legal stuff out of the way what a great way to open up this show I'll probably I'll try to shuffle and find something about Milwaukee's Lake Park for next week for the next 5 minutes you'll hear all the legal stuff that we have to say about our show all right we will be right back [Music] [Music] you guys like Funko fakirs Funko figures are my favorite if that hasn't been clearly expressed sarcastically in the past okay alright no neither of you collected any of the day with Pikachu stuff right no no and I'm not gonna start collecting this new one which is an afternoon with easy and fresh I like it pokemon and Funko collaborate on a new Pokemon Center figure collection the Pokemon company international in collaboration with Funko has announced a full lineup of the afternoon with Evie and Friends collection of Pokemon figures for Pokemon Center the premiere destination for official high quality Pokemon merchandise in the u.s. yeah the new series of nine figures celebrates fan favorites of Pokemon Eevee and its evolution the line up the line comes with on the heels of the incredibly popular a day with Pikachu figure collection from the Pokemon company international and Funko which depicted the iconic character Pikachu enjoying various seasons and holidays similar to a day with Pikachu fans will be able to pick up a new figure from an afternoon with Evie and friends each month starting on February 18th with the first product showcasing Eevee and then in March we will get Mayport on April sylveon May Glacia that makes yes yes put Glaceon the ice pokemon in May okay the one that no one will buy flareon in June Espeon in July Jolteon in august Leafeon in September and Umbreon in October I can't I can't I can't do this again yeah i R I did it in the first time yes no neither and then if the sylveon is really cute and the Glaceon is really I mean that and then they have to be really cute I might but like I already have a flair yen figure that I don't like in my house that's why your problem your problem started with the F and ends with the e on why do i why do you have a flareon so back in the day when there was a whole bunch of Pokemon figures that were put out it wasn't a kid of other things that I actually wanted it's his hair like the Redford stepchild that is just there as I go you know flaring what was the one that I wanted that's the one did I mention to you that my I got a coupon skull for Christmas like not an official one I would assume no way golf anthe yeah 3d printed cubone skull it's so cute super disturbing is more like it you're just jealous a little bit so I did the math these were $15 apiece the Pikachu ones twelve of them that came to $180 I mean I'm on the website Nintendo light that says if you do all of them will cost you three a one hundred and thirty four dollars and 91 cents is that with tax and service charge yeah yeah no way without without tax and service charges also the amount of times where I was like well if I just get my car 250 I don't have to pay for shipping which is a big big selling point I don't like Evie enough I just don't I really like sylveon a lot I'm but I'm an all-or-nothing kind of guy I mean you can break that you can just get the things you want and be happy with the ones that you actually want that's true you can say there there was only I only have friendship with sylveon and that's the only one I got or you could recognize that possessions possess you not the other way around and live life free from Erica Greco look look around my place you know I'm no Marie Kondo but I don't paint this lien by figurines that literally do not not since I was seven years old and I went to the windward Center Mall in Kaneohe Hawaii and got a smurf figurine of like sporty Smurfs playing basketball that's the last one I bought so it has been thirty nine years since I bought my last figurine and I have since from since then recognized that wow what a waste of money that is so what I'm hearing for your birthday you want Smurfs I don't have birthdays anymore and no you do the Smurfs don't exist anymore oh they do laughs Murph's exist in Germany the Smurfs last time I was at Will's house I saw the cynical flush that I got you for your birthday like five years ago still in the box well if you take it out it's not worth anything brightly that's very true it's on my shelf of stuffed animals that you can live on that shelf friends go no further maybe the real secret is you as soon as I if you know I'm coming you you pull up like you have a clown's ability you have a closet of gifts that people have gotten you and then when you know your closet you rest you rotate out the gifts not discovered my secret you know this to be true search your feelings let's talk about Pokemon home this is it's slightly better than bank slightly okay also shout out to shout out to James from our attic channel for sending us the fun code news so this is off this is just the press release that the Pokemon company sent me the Pokemon company international announced international announced today that Pokemon home a cloud service designed as a place to gather all your Pokemon is now available on the Nintendo switch system the App Store and Google Play Pokemon home enables trainers to take Pokemon from my firm linked Pokemon series games deposit them in boxes in the cloud and move them around to other linked and compatible games also by linking the same Nintendo account on both to both versions of home the Nintendo switch version and the mobile version fans can access the same Pokemon boxes from both hardware platforms the Nintendo's switch version of Pokemon home supports connectivity to Nintendo switch games such as Pokemon sword Pokemon shield Pokemon let's go Pikachu and Pokemon let's go Eevee both then intend to switch versions of Pokemon home and the mobile device versions of Pokemon home support connectivity to the Nintendo 3ds software pokemon bank to commemorate the release of Pokemon home Pokemon bank and Pokemon transporter will be at no cost from Wednesday February 12th to Thursday March 12th trainers will be able to gather Pokemon from various Pokemon Series games using Pokemon bank and transporter once they have their Pokemon in Pokemon Bank trainers will then be able to move those Pokemon from Pokemon home if they have a paid premium plan in Pokemon home and that's what the press releases and then it directs me to the website which has no new information that it had before but let's talk about it for the most part at least for me it was pretty smooth to download install use it transferring was incredibly easy well so let me ask you my first question I when I saw that people started having access to it I went to the App Store on my iPhone and typed Pokemon home and nothing came up what was I doing wrong nothing nothing um so that this has nothing to do with Game Freak or Nintendo it just has to do with how the App Store has to index actual search results on your devices and how there's like a slow rollout of apps for people so sometimes somebody can get an update to an app before somebody else gets an update because they don't push it to all devices at once they push it in in groups so what's the wait just other people was in other people's app stores before it was in my App Store yes yes there is a trick there is a trick to this for anyone who ever wants to find an app early so for example if somebody is like hey Pokemon I'll just use Pokemon apps for example if somebody says hey Pokemon go has an update and you check the update tab and there's no update it's probably because your device hasn't indexed that yet but if you were to like search for Pokemon go and go to the actual app you'll probably see the update button there because it is posted it's just that your device hasn't received that yep that's an update that a software title I needed the software title so when new software gets added what you can do is if you know the developers name because again it's so the app is there it's just the search engine the search engine in your app store has an indexed it yet so what I was telling people to do is if you search for Magikarp jump which is indexed and you click on Magikarp jump and then you click on the developer which is the Pokemon company international you can see all the apps that they've published and one of them was Pokemon home so you was you were able to get it before your search engine indexed it so that was how people were getting it a little bit quicker than other people well hi there way left a bad taste in my mouth classic well did you did you use it we'll have you downloaded it did you pay the $60 okay I have downloaded it both to my phone after Gregg so kindly sent me the link to the application I downloaded onto my switch I have paid the 16 dollars I spent probably 10 minutes on my switch looking for where I could do friend codes because I kept getting friend codes from all these other people couldn't find them got frustrated stopped for a while realized that you could only do the friend codes on the phone yup because that's stupid and so and I sent out a few friend codes to people and they said are you having a seizure why are you typing all these letters because it doesn't give you any other information other than blurt here's a bunch of letters and this is where it ends I went on my switch and I said I'm going to connect to Pokemon bank I'm gonna select which of my Pokemon and Pokemon bank I'm gonna upload because I'm like this this is Will Anderson SWAT process I was like it knows who I am obviously there's a whole part of the switch that says here's your friends from your 3ds so make them your friends on your switch so it's like it knows who I am so then I go in and and it's like get the move key from the bank to say to connect in the move with the things and then I'm like okay okay then they went to my 3ds and I open Pokemon back it's like you've got a software update that's gonna take about 45 minutes to download and install and I was like whatever you know what I'll just do a living Dex and Pokemon sword and shield and eventually I'll get back around to this where I am right now actually that's conversation heaven with you they just hurdle after hurdle after hurdle in my way I mean today I can't be easy to be fair I'm sure if you were to like update your Pokemon transport or your Pokemon bank right now if it would probably be instantaneous because not a million people are trying to do it on the day that they released it all so I turned it on on the switch and some freaky looking hippie and with future like the guy is like the doctor from Back to the Future who I thought was the weakest part of that entire movie sunglasses on assaults me and then it leaves me in the hands of pokeball boy whatever his name is pokey boy here's the secret of pokey boy he gives you all the information about the things that you don't need information and it gives you no information about the things that you do need information about that is accurate pokey boy is definitely designed by James Turner right like if you ever follow far sure James Turner on Instagram or Twitter it is a million percent his his style I think the Professor Oak is called Grand Oak is that correct and oak yeah which is which is really calls into question where he fits in the oak family tree there's actually like a kind of a I can maybe answer that question for you are you are you are you saying that you are not happy with with Pokemon um well I can't tell yet cuz I really haven't been able to use it sounds like you have some complaints I do oh and also talking to Greg scared me off the whole thing Greg convinced I was sat there for fifteen minutes as they screamed at me about how awful it was I was like oh no I'm really not touching this they made a lot of weird choices that I was like why why are you doing this why why did you do it this way like the mobile version has the Pokemon goal box interface which I absolutely hate Pokemon box whoo and go it doesn't have no boxes correct oh you don't like that there's boxes I why I like that there's boxes I like knowing where I put things when they go into home is just a giant list of everything that I've put in whatever order is decided the fact that there are labels that it auto creates for itself that the game doesn't tell you hey these are labels that you can work and use with and what they do they're just hidden here yeah the label stuff once you discover the label stuff it's it's it's awesome but they but they don't do anything to tell you about it don't worry of it like pokey boy is just a boy weenie pokeyman pokeyman how how to actually make a usable product that is fun and human okay it's easy rant it is easy to figure out labels on your own and once you figure out labels you're like this is a better system than what Pokemon bank had if you get there yeah it's not easy to get there and like there isn't there is nothing except for a challenge that says hey you've created a label I'm like I did where where is this label I created and if I click on the challenge it don't tell me where that is or what it what it is or where to find it I have to not only do you have to find it yourself but you have to have pressed on the right area for three seconds or longer for it to launch there are so many maddening things that they've just put in the way of making their ease of use functions actually easy to use as then look pretty boy spoke a boy had one job he failed he failed F and correct me if I'm wrong but a friend trade is only local haven't tried trading so I don't know I have only gotten it to work locally and I don't know if that's a server issue or if that's just the way it works which makes friend codes and friend trading useless and since they didn't put any additional blocks or any sort of additional filters on the GTS or wonder boxing well those are essentially as useless as they always have been GTS is always pretty useless like unless you were like I really just nice in a / ugly can somebody out there willing to trade apparently oh you want Mewtwo for / ugly all right well eventually I'll find somebody who's wanting like a Bellsprout for ugly all right done got the pearly that's like the best that GTS can offer you because otherwise it's like I'm looking for new crows MA but I'm only willing to trade weepin yeah I mean there are some bad trades on GTS well I know but GTS is like terribly broken right now because you can't trade so I don't know if this is intentional but you can't trade mythical Pokemon B of the GTRs so like melt an Mel medal like Cal do your you can't trade those Pokemon but when you do the the legendary mythical filter Pokemon that are still legendary like taboo cocoa taboo Leela a type null sieve allied they still appear in the results even if you have that filter off so I don't know what happened there but everything in regards to the GTS we can we could spend 20 minutes talking about how it's broken out how it doesn't work or we can just say currently as of this podcast it's broken and it doesn't work correct but so that's my thing right like at this point the one thing that does work is is an expanded Bank on the switch that's the part that works that ain't worth 16 bucks I can't say in good faith that all the other features that it was supposed to bring and I'm disappointed that it brought nothing more than what was on their website there's nothing hidden there's nothing additional it is exactly what's offered and what's offered is poorly implemented that's not worth $16 to me maybe in the future but right now nah you needed to go lower if you were gonna have this many problems at the start but things that just didn't work hold on it's only been like it's not even been a week no true has not even been a full week and I would assume that the GTS part is the hardest part I get right what happens when we assume no no that's fine I'm sure okay so there's a couple of things that I think are really important here but stupid program I know but I think that's the hardest thing to get right because of how many people will be putting things on and off that you can put up to 10 things on the GTS if you're paying right the GTS is existed for 10 years now what how long do they need to get it right it's been 10 years I agree the GTS is hot garbage they know what's legal they would know that a level-one Venusaur isn't a thing that can be asked for like uh you know a male Salah so the system at this point ten years into this process should not allow a person to select that yeah it should be able to say hey that is not a valid trade that is not something you can look for yep and you're just you're just clogging up our servers with a bunch of garbage that is something that they should prioritize ten years into this process and when it's a major part of your program when you're saying pay for three extra slots to gain access to the GTS by the way we've done nothing to it it is still hot garbage full of hot garbage we've improved it in no way and not only that you can't trains with your friends across the country or across the world give us your 16 bucks excuse me so you can't trade with your friends across the world you just have to enhance it you have to use room trade so I know that for sure works I don't know what about the first part I can't speak to that room trade random like you get a random you think you can room trade with just one other person so you both join the room trade because room trade you have to give out a code so like if I start a room trade for you I can give you a code you can join it and then we both pick Pokemon in that trade works I know for sure that roads will be the death of us seriously well bit is no better than trading in I mean how long is the code I please say it's better that I have not room traded yet I just know that as if it's for we're in the same problem that sword and shields in like come on I don't know I don't know I hundred percent agree with you that it's been ten years of the GTS and they can't figure out basic things that are clearly issues level wooden Venus or shiny Victini shiny Victini is like a good example of a pokemon that has never ever been released and yet multiple people have gotten shiny victini's wonder traded to them there is a simple and basic check that needs to exist for that and they haven't implemented it same with level one venusaur although I think like level 15 Dragon Knight is technically illegal because I think you could have caught a level 15 Dragon Knight in altars Ultra moon in like a 1% SOS encounter but yes may also landed so there's already like that that is a huge problem that some people don't care about and that's always pushed me away from the GTS I like obviously be be hacked I am sure it exists but I don't think there's ever been a situation where meloetta has not been in a cherish ball or marsh shadow has not been in cherish ball and I'm sure that I'm sure there are more shadows in moon balls or meloetta Zin luxury balls that are existing and all of those Pokemon are obviously faked fake Pokemon yeah I do they do they not care are they unaware is it just broken because to me my complaint was this GTS feels like it's just no pun intended over the last couple episodes they just copy and pasted it from Mexico High and plopped it into here and like the legendary filters can't even figure out if type nul qualifies as a legendary or not it does by the way it just the filters doesn't roof like that so yes I do agree with you there I will say though I have a lick of cough I have a little bit of confidence because Pokemon homes shipped with one point zero point two and within the not even five days of it being out it's already at one point zero point four so they have pushed two updates as we're recording it it's the weekend I doubt any developer or anyone working on Pokemon home worked on it this weekend they probably shipped one point zero point four said it's stable enough where it's working we'll come back on Monday and we'll start implementing stuff oh you better get me on in on that person's performance admission no time off for failures buddy heck no if we don't get time off for an iPhone watch y'all don't get it for home what weekends are for people who give us a functional wonder trades weekends aren't for you bud I have faith I believe that Pokemon bank had like three updates in the seven years that existed but how what kind of a testament to it is to the quality of Pokemon home is it that they've had to have four updates in one week it's like we released without actually thinking or Terran I don't have to be fair for $16 yeah but like app development is extremely hard and there are not only iOS devices but there's Android devices but not only are people running those on iOS 13 but probably thirteen point one probably twelve point four probably eleven point nine I think as long as you're running iOS 9 and higher you're allowed to use Pokemon home on top of like the different processors and then you go over to Android I'm sure somebody who's like I made an app it's not that complicated but it is okay that's fine but they have tons of money and they are already withholding features that they know that they don't have ready there is no integration with Pokemon go alright leave out the wonder trade until you can make it a not garbage wonder trade right and still like take my 16 dollars and say in two months you can have wonder trade you know what actually I'll hold off on my 16 dollars until you give me the good wonder trade and Greg can verify for me it's like there's no excuse for a company of this level with this much money to release a product that's so crummy and with just like so poorly documented and just fundamentally for me and this is really what I got from the conversation with Greg previously was hey why can't it be one application why does it literally have to be something completely different between the switch and the phone why do I need to learn two applications to do one thing manage my cloud stored Pokemon why it's just it makes no sense and like finding out that you can zoom in and zoom out oh it's like an it's it's like old style programs where it's like the developers put it out didn't tell you how to use it and you are literally relying and your friends and other people on the internet say hey did you know you could do this no I didn't that would make this so much better oh thank you person they're telling me this is they bought into the snapchat mentality we're not going to explain anything to anybody so that the people who figure it out can be the cool kids oh that's not what I needed from my Pokemon home is more like the Pokemon homeless so besides GTS and trading being a mess my Pokemon list like Pokemon go on in the home app being a nightmare yes I see I don't think that's like an issue I do it's so easy to filter though it should also be easy to have them in the order that I put them in an easily recognizable on the main switch so that when I go to the home app I'm not confronted with a completely different UI that I have to now learn well my complaint was how the like why button is like inverse and the X button is inverse on the switch version compared to sword and shield cuz they're like hit the X is it like you hit the X button and certain shields like toggle between yes select all select one or like swap but in the switch for in the home version you hit like the Ellen R button you hit the it's the other is it's not the Ln R it's the ones below it's the no no Ellen R is how you filter between the ones Y like swap button is like Y instead of like exercising if something that many ways the to you guys don't match each other and that's extremely frustrating cuz your realize that don't match each other cuz there's the one in sword and shield there's the home switch and there's the home app on the mobile yes and none of a match which is like really none of these are gonna work the same also you're gonna give me a list of challenges but not tell me what I'm working for I just have to randomly stumble on to them and one of your challenges whatever challenges is using the wonder box the wonder box that is deeply problematic which I don't want to touch it it's too scary yeah I don't touch it either but that's it that is one of the things that's one of the challenges and I've done it I've used it I mean I've had successful wonder trades but it's just like also it took 10-15 hours for my wonder box trades to go through what's you know I think what's really frustrating too is we had so much hope for what this was going to be and just just for it to be so not that is a huge disappointment for sixteen dollars and has been said that you know once I've bought the sixteen dollars and brought everything over and I'm over the thirty I'm locked into sixteen dollars for the life of this the life of this program if I ever want to get them out again because we don't know what happens if you stop paying what thirty do you get Harry say they they specifically say on their website so that's so that's not what sort of you get access to if you stop plant if you stop paying your Pokemon do not get deleted you just cannot withdraw or put in so any of them any of them so you don't even get the box of thirty anymore it's just they'll get the box of 30 although I'm not completely sure which Pokemon are sitting in the initial box actually I'm assuming the initial box on that one is it the first thirty that you have on home is it which first thirty eight it is it like that's another thing that they don't explain like you don't get access to the other own grant fine so I've got ones that are locked away which you I is telling me which thirty I get well ask pokey boy hey long since it's all he's saying is hey look at these challenges you don't want to do the thing is I will say this the thing is I I have been using a lot of home I really want to like it I really want to be able to use it I want it to be more than what it is but I'm already confronted with a bunch of just decisions that don't make sense that are actually very frustrating to use and I'm only sticking with it because I'm a huge fan and I have so many Pokemon that I want to bring up and yeah it was absolutely cool to bring the Rosalia that I bred an emerald that I created there I have now brought it all the way up to home that is that was a great moment for me but it's a nightmare to get there and so many people who are less into this system are just it's just a turn-off it's just like this could be something and it's not it is a barely better version of Bank at this point and that's really frustrating it's better than Bank it is there's undeniably that it's better than Bank but it's not that much better I have confidence because this is the same conversation more or less that we had when Pokemon go came out and Pokemon go has added a million new features since the three plus years it's been around it had prot it had a way worse start than this did when we couldn't even get into it well I mean people couldn't download it for 48 hours so let's like and if you had if you had a trainer club account you couldn't get into it at all and it was you linked it so you can't you can't change anymore and and then if and all the people with the Google accounts they were having the time of their life no release is perfect and that's not even the main thing is that even if this release was perfect the product that they're presenting is below expectation below my expectation I will say that like other people have I'm sure loved it and they're like oh what it was a place to store 50,000 Pokemon I don't care if they're act right things that you were specifically complaining about the GTS the Wonder trade the friend thing like that was something that was not on my radar specifically just because I never planned on using those features although I do a completely acknowledge that the fact that basic checks like shiny Victini mail still landed it that's unacceptable for them to not even have those basic checks but the core feature that I was paying for which is getting all the Pokemon in one place seeing it on my iphone to me is worth the sixteen dollars and I do love the label system I was able to import all of Irene's Pokemon because I'm a thief and I stole all her Pokemon yep from her copy of moon and then her copy of ultra moon and then because they were - they were both named Irene but they have different player IDs I was able to highlight all those Pokemon and assign on Irene label to it so now just by filtering through labels I can instantly see all of Irene's Pokemon quickly I can then also label all the ultra beasts as ultra beasts so I can quickly find them no matter where they are and I think that's more important that's why I'm not hanging on to that box thing as you are Greg it's just different types of organization some people might like wooden hangers some people might like plastic hangers as long as there's no wire hanging up never listen here Christina we're gonna get this floor clean if we're gonna organize these pokemon Christina but the the labeling system on top of how I've already used markings is is is like the best like I love the overall Pokemon go like look that there are no boxes I can just scroll through it I actually do prefer that it's weird so that makes me just I stare at it and I'm like I don't want to be here I want to leave the switch version kind of has both it has the boxes but then if you hit like the Y button you have the entire list view which is ultimately like that Pokemon go view I love how I was actually really curious how how they were gonna show the Pokemon but like the little flat 2d 3d models that they have I think look really great and I love that you can see the difference between if they are shiny or if they're not shiny like right on your device yeah you can search by shiny which was you know something I didn't think was going to happen on both devices you can certain you can favorite Pokemon which is great that was something that came from Pokemon go that I really wanted you can search by pokey ruse which is something that was not advertised that we didn't think like oh is it does it have pokey wrists is it a cured pokey wrist so that's an awesome search feature there is no search for what was the other thing that would have been obvious there's no search for like does this Pokemon have a ribbon which is a bit of a bummer but I've already marked all my ribbons with like this search by IVs you can't I you can ah no I don't think so hmm you can search by game so you can search by like what game did it touch last did it touch pokemon home last a touch let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee you can search by how these Pokemon move to a game like can can I search by all Pokemon that can be available in Pokemon shield which is great so there is so with all the complaints aside there is some really powerful things you can do searching marking and labeling wise that I think like if there was no GTS if there was no wonder trade like the searching alone to me is worth it like I'm already up to 3200 Pokemon and I haven't even moved any Pokemon over from my copies of black black to her cold soul silver platinum because I'm trying to get a living Dex in black too before I move those 500 plus Pokemon over but these these are other Pokemon that came from my like XY Sun Moon Omega Ruby copies so I'm like super super happy with that and they'll again going back to like the label things with something I didn't think I wanted but man it makes it so great in combination with like the other ways I specifically search although labels not being so you can see a label marking on the switch but you can't mark labels on the switch which is really weird mm-hmm the box organizational features of Pokemon home I am super satisfied with and the the the one thing that is really cool also is how you can on switch because they use boxes you can move an entire box normally you would press like the LR to switch it to the green the green is like to select all but if you you can actually pick up an entire box and you can move it instead of having so this is this is like hard to explain visually so let's say like in sort and shield you have like box one box two box three box 4 box 5 etc up to 32 and you might have renamed those boxes to like shiny one like shiny box one GMAX box one GMAX box two and so ideally if you were to select all the pokemon and the GMAX and move it over into home you would then have to go into home and then rename that home box like GMAX box one but instead a cool feature is you can literally lift up the entire box so if you named G box G max box 1 G max box 2 G max box 3 and pokemon sword and shield you can picked up pick up all three of those boxes name included background included and move them into home and it keeps everything there which is really great because you can start organizing and arranging no matter where you are and not have to be like oh well I have to rename 14 boxes in home and I have to rename 14 boxes and sword and shield because that's it takes 14 boxes to complete my living decks you can just literally lift the whole box up which is really great umm I think I think the interface on the eye I think the go interface on iOS I like it I guess Greg doesn't but I think it's garbage I love it I love the like the zoom in I love that I can see my shiny Machamp right next to my other Machamp right next to all my machop's I love being able to click on it and then tap the little I can look at the Eevee's I can tap it again to see the the judge stuff I can see that it has pokey wrist I can scroll down Oh beaut Bob I can see all my ribbons here on this Machamp that I transferred up from Crystal but wait what would be the point to my accepting your friend request there's nothing we can do I can see if you're a gen 1 or not by what icon if not I can i okay the sticker stuff is really to reel-to-reel the icons you can be a real set yeah it's pretty limited there's only like 8 choices I can see the cool sticker things you have I have no stickers hit question answered yeah oh that interface is also super frustrating like how do I get to my room to put on stickers oh I have to click on my name there's nothing that says my room all right I also feel about stickers the same way I figure feel about Funko pops alright I had this question I'm looking at the the fa Q's here I had this question can I access Pokemon home on multiple smart devices or Nintendo switch consoles wasn't linked to a Nintendo account you can access your Pokemon home from one smart device and multiple Nintendo switch consoles yeah and how ridiculous is that so I can't use Pokemon home on my iPhone and my iPad yeah it's I I haven't I haven't even downloaded the iPad version I don't even know if it's a fourth interface I I doubt it I just hope it's not the tiny iPhone interface on an iPad screen which they used to do back in the day each Pokemon home account is limited to one smart device at a time linking your Nintendo accounts your Pokemon home on a new smart device will transfer your information to the new device okay so the coolest thing that we didn't talk about as we're waiting for this link trade is coolest it is really cool I think and it's like the one thing that out of this whole launch of this product that they did right so you're you're coming to my side of the what universe alright at some point you're the the 3ds recognized your Nintendo account and recognized that you downloaded Pokemon bank and I knew tons of people at least a dozen plus just because I stream on Twitch that came into my stream like for the last couple months and asked hey I no longer have my 3ds I sold it how can I get this Pokemon in Pokemon bank into Pokemon home and I was like I've lost cause buddy I don't know wait hold on a second it Payton if you're listening this is the part you need to listen to okay public service announcement right there so section Steve do something oh it's so much Pokemon okay it worked okay I'm gonna select I'm gonna select no I'm not going to tell you oh you can see it this is actually really cool I'm very happy with this this is pretty cool oh wait you can emot-- look at I am Oded that's cuz I'm happy that we're trading dang that's actually really cute will is still trying to pick a Pokemon wait can I pick a different one I'm like yeah I think you can select a mote I can't do anything I'm not gonna trade one of the two Pokemon I have in Pokemon home I picked a different Pokemon and then ie moded wait what - Pokemon you have at home the two that they give you for free oh just leave yeah yes they don't worry you know and what happens at the little door button I there is no door button lower we'll get out of the Pokemon selection.i how okay pick a Pokemon and then hit and then hit the door okay so we see the Pikachu and then there should be the red door okay now you're gone yes so the trade I guess we have to wait till the trade number is complete oh my god thanks for all the help okie boy okay so coolest thing came in okay so pump your twitch numbers is mighty else when you download it on the on the switch it'll say like move from Pokemon bank and it will say like do you have your 3ds yes or no and if you say no it will read your Nintendo ID the email you used and since obviously on the switch and on my 3ds I used the same Nintendo ID which is my personal email address it then saw that it saw my I have two Pokemon banks I have one Pokemon bank on my original DS that I used everyday and then I had another Pokemon Bank which was tied to a Disney female because that other 3ds was the 3ds that has a capture card in it that I used to stream and so I said I was like let me just test this I'm gonna say no that I don't have my 3ds but I did it was just wasn't on and it was able to read that original Pokemon bank which only had like 30 Pokemon in and instantly transfer them all over because that 3ds downloaded Pokemon home with the same email address which was tied to my Nintendo ID that my switches which is awesome for anyone who did sell theirs they sell their 3ds or traded in or do whatever they did with it oh it's trading the far fetch there it goes oh this information is really sweet yeah there any animations good also like Captain Planet just like destroyed that pokeball yeah oh nice boring polka ball you sent me I think that was a far fetched in let's go I give you personally cared for inbred trades and you give me some random stranger you picked up on the streets of Kanto so if we go to continue trading it puts us back in the same room which is pretty cool I'm out okay well there you go now we know how to trade two people specifically two people specifically in the most convoluted a hundred and eighty second way each time so that that saved a bunch of people who that's a weird thing to me I guess like if I cared about Pokemon and I cared about Pokemon pink I don't think I would sell my only 3ds with access to Pokemon bank on it that's just me but I guess those people existed because I talked to all of those people yep so then the other way you can do it is yes I have my 3ds and then you're inside the 3ds it'll say like because the the Pokemon bank had an update it'll say like generate a QR code and then you type that code in or you type that like 16 to 12 digit code into your switch and then it initiate the transfer and and that's really cool it's like that it worked really well it was very convenient for people who no longer had access to their 3ds whether they sold it whether they broke it whether it's somewhere in their house and they just can't find it that is a really really cool feature that worked extremely well and probably saved a bunch of people's pokémon well it's gonna save paintings Pokemon can other players online do tend to switch console access my Pokemon when using Pokemon home players can choose to deposit and withdraw Pokemon to and from compatible services on their Nintendo switch this means other players with Pokemon home can access Pokemon from your games unattended switch be careful not to transfer all their players Pokemon on your console without permission I guess that still doesn't answer my question like if I have two accounts on my switch do they still see the both the same home hmm I thought I had to indicate who I was playing as when I opened Pokemon home so Oh interests a B how can I trade pokémon with other players in Pokemon home there are four ways to trade Greg using Pokemon and Pokemon home wonder box GTS room trade and friend trade can I trade with specific friends players ages 16 and older can use the trip friend trade feature to trade pokémon with other users you become friends with on a smart device you can add friends in the add friend feature be friends listen Pokemon home is not connected to your friends list yet we already know that Pokemon can only be traded with the mobile version of home switch does not support trade feature we knew that so then there's a couple things so when you when you sign up for Pokemon home you get the Pikachu which I uh I heard some people got an English Pikachu some people got a Japanese Pikachu I got a Japanese Pikachu I got a Japanese Pikachu the one that they gave me for free yeah yeah I don't know look at it I have to find it because I only have my mobile phone up here so I know what box it is in but can I find it here I got there's four pika - how many Pikachu's you got I have like been playing this game for 200 years he's got a thousand Pikachu's I just like 80 and hats the one thing they give you doesn't have a hat okay you can't search on hat vs. no hat that's sure there's no excessive research if you okay so it's all I have witnesses seem to have a fateful encounter in Pokemon home it is just named Pikachu and it's English Oh weird you got an English one when did I get a shiny Pikachu in was it the one from sorowitsch ball it wasn't long from Target I bet oh that's it look at all these lame hats if you used one label for the first time it gives you a Pichu also when you install the mobile version it gives you a choice between Charmander squirtle and Bulbasaur think you have to transfer from Pokemon bank to make that appear and then you can you can pick either Charmander Bulbasaur squirtle and then the specific starter will have the hidden ability yep I went with squirtle which is cool because then you can breed that and trade those two to your friends and then I've heard so this this is there's there's a couple issues with it some people weren't getting their Pikachu right away some people weren't getting their Pichu I think this has to do with servers and how it detects if you complete your national dex which is at this point of recording 890 Pokemon you will get the original form McGee erna which is supposed to be the McGee erna in the that looks like the pokeball colors the McGee Erna that you get in Sun and Moon or ultra Sun alternate I should say the QR code which you can still do by the way if you're missing McGee Rinna you can go to Pokemon official website find the QR code scan it transfer it up that's like the all silver one which is like the non original because it was like old and rusted or whatever but some people haven't gotten Miggy Rinna some people I've heard that's real hit or miss some people got McGee Rena original form some people got the McGee R now which is the not regional form so I think that'll be resolved because also some people didn't get Pikachu right away when they download the app but then like a day later the Pikachu showed up so I'm not a hundred percent sure what's happening there did I never put any of my my gear in it into this game apparently not how could you well there it is found it there is mass transfer in Pokemon home so you can select up to 100 Pokemon and throw them away which people were very excited about if you were breeding and sword and shield you take all three of those boxes move them to home and throw them all away at once or wonder trade them into non-existence because who knows where they're going and wonder trade if you transfer from Pokemon home I believe you get 3000 home points which translates into a hundred battle points trying to think of like other things you know in the home point do yet they just turn into battle points they're just a substitute for whatever I think Pokemon bank called them pokey miles and then pokey miles turned into battle points it's the same does I mean I have like three thousand but I don't know how to make them do anything on the switch version you can cash them in cuz then you will pick either sword or shield to send them to ah so you know this difference between the UI is again such great break good great there you go search for the GTS to see what people are asking for quick give me a Pokemon search for rubbish I can get a level eleventh rubbish Spanish trubbish if I give a kirim of any kind oh nice oh here I can get a level fifteen trubbish in a luxury ball okay and why do people do this for za magenta it's I mean it's the same on P TCG oh you'll be like oh I'm looking for full art Cynthia and they're like we want we want 700 packs of sword and shield and we want the deed to your house for this full art Cynthia card and it's well no I mean this is worse I don't know pretty bad wait wait wait oh wait look I can get a Japanese trubbish in a dusk ball and you know what they want back at rubbish hey there you go I'm getting Italian rubbish for art rubbish why are you asking for something you already have because then they can Masuda but there's no character you're gonna get a foreign language oh oh here's a Turkish for manaphy that's a good trait I should get on that one ah there there and so going back to the sticker stuff the it it does I don't know it's like spark a at least for me and everyone's different but it does spark a collecting threshold not threshold it does I guess it just makes me want to you elect you want to so you want to do complete the challenges because I want home right so you will have to wonder box trade no that's not true well it's one of the challenger boards you get a sticker for it okay yes I will have to wonder trade sure and I will just throw out everything I don't wonder trade you need it do it 25 times that's fine what okay we have to ruin truly after rune trade five more times all right well well do I get the star sticker so for example you get a unique sticker if you or like background sticker I guess if you have all the unknown in your Pokemon home which I did I was one of those people that in firered/leafgreen I caught all the unknown and then I transferred them all the way up and then you get like a unique sticker if you get all the different forms forms of mini or which I don't have and now I want to go back to Sun and Moon and catch the other how many are there eight and then you get like a sticker if you have all the forms of out crummy Pokemon home on the switch and on the mobile version actually shows you the differences between the pumpkaboo is you have and the gorg Isis you have because they have different sizes and I'm assuming once you have all the sizes I think there are five sizes of each you get a sticker there too going back to Minear they did change mini or shiny so many are now has a new shiny that you can see in Pokemon home in Pokemon on the switch and on the mobile version and they did change you have all the mini are colors yes including the shiny I don't know if you need the shiny or not I don't think you need the shiny because the one person I saw that has the minier background I don't think has a shiny is there's a background or is it a stick it's like the background sticker because if you look at my eye yeah the wallpapers sorry okay cuz I thought I moved on my mini are up here but apparently have it you might be missing a color excuse me don't think you need the shiny but that's a good question I may not have movement Munir up in here I know I have to check that should be really easy right should be not so it does make me want like oh I can visually see now in Pokemon home that I can see the pumpkaboo sizes it is they did pay I guess somebody on that team was like hey you know what we should really update mini or shiny cuz we have a bigger color palette than the 3ds offered they went out of their way and they updated Castform shiny so prior to this coming out Castform had just a pink shiny and then when the weather changed I think everyone should anyone who played Pokemon go probably is very sick of Castform and it shiny because it spawned a lot on that lotad day but when Castform evolved in past games or not evolved but changed due to the weather into sunny day Castform or or rainy day Castform you could no longer tell it was shiny because the forms didn't have Chinese but now the forms actually have Chinese so they went out of their way to change those which is like great I mean they've changed Pokemon Chinese in the past they've changed Charizard shiny they've changed Typhlosion shiny I think they've changed ponyta shiny they've changed Gliscor shiny a million times for whatever reason so they have changed shinies before so those were some notable changes the GTS does have a cool feature of showing you how many Pokemon have been traded so as of this recording 1.7 million Pokemon have been wondered traded since the game has come out with the number one beings a.cian knows amazon tow is actually number one right now well that's Josh Ian got moved to number two so yeah for me it is triggering that like I want to collect all the forms but I'm sure some people don't care I did notice on the switch version if a Pokemon has gender differences so you can I think hit the start the plus button on the switch to like well if it's shiny or not so if you like hover over wheedle and you hit the start button it goes from shiny to not shiny but on a pokemon like Pikachu if you I can't see shiny male Pikachu because I don't have a shiny male Pikachu registered but if I toggle over to female Pikachu and then I hit the plus button I can flip between shiny male or shiny female and regular female Pikachu so there are attentions to detail with that kind of stuff but of course no attention to detail if shiny victini's getting wonder traded I don't know if that's like two different teams I don't know if they if something's just broken GTS wise uh it seems like there's there's the there seems to be a lot of attention to detail in the searching stuff in the search by move search by ot search by markings shiny form favorite recent game games that can go to pokey wrists the label stuff but then there's other stuff where it just doesn't seem to care I'd I don't think it's perfect I'd say I can solidly say it's not perfect but it is having Pokemon onto my my phone is definitely what I wanted and so I'm satisfied in that department I just hope that the other things get better and so they've met the the minimum criteria yeah it made it okay so and and seeing them update the game twice already is a good sign so hopefully we see another update and hopefully next time we talk we can update you on the maguey earnest situation for whatever that's worth okay we'll take a break we just got some Pokemon masters after the break our pokemon of the week and our question of the week so we will be right back I watched the anime on The WB wow I feel w [Music] we're back just a couple updates real quick I want to dwell any more time on this everything I found is room trade is local only so I don't know for a friend trader circle only various nuff friend trade is local only because the day's at just waste like four hours of this podcast trying to room trade Frank we do yeah we did room trade because friend trade is based off the GPS that's why when you go into fur and trade it says checking GPS there's nowhere I can find the reason why that is but seems to be what it is the other thing is I'm on pokemons FAQ page and they've literally been updating it as we've been doing this podcast so mystery gift was updated 20 minutes ago home requirements was updated two hours ago troubleshooting Pokemon home on your mobile device is updated three minutes ago if I deposit 31 or more Pokemon in Pokemon home and my premium plant expires what happens to my Pokemon so this is one hour ago and Pokemon support if you deposit 31 or more Pokemon Pokemon home while you have the premium plan and then your plan changes to the no-cost basic plan you will not be able to view or withdraw any Pokemon beyond the 30th you deposited by Rhian rolling by re-enrolling in the premium plan you will be able to view all the information about additional Pokemon as well as move them out of Pokemon home so it doesn't say they delete your Pokemon no but so is going off of the first 30 that are in the box on the switch if you cannot find what you're looking for Greg click here to submit a surface request oh boy that's going to get answered in six months I don't want you to lose your partnership so we're good I'm not partnered with the Pokemon company oh it's an Intendant everybody yeah this is off support not pokemon.com is what I'm really okay I um I did actually use Pokemon support I had to ask them to change my legal name and they were able to do it within 24 hours it was actually impressive oh nice speaking of partnerships I am partnered with DNA full disclosure there Greg is not partnered with DNA I'm gonna read the news I'm not saying not partnering with them and I still have yet to open the game so this is off this is off their website this is 12 13 20 21 up to the six month celebration on their way so we still don't know what the six month celebration will be we don't know what it's supposed to be at least this is just the run-up to in Pokemon masters is coming up to the six months of launch thanks to the support of all you trainers out there that's you listener driving in your car right now are washing the dishes to support we were holding various rallies a part of our six month celebration the first one is between now and February 27th which is Pokemon Day which is actually makes me curious if the new event will be the day after Pokemon Day and they will probably announce it on Pokemon Day would be my guess so the Pokemon Center will be decorated to commemorate the six-month celebration period from now until March 15th and you will be able to get 300 gems which is one character poll every single day you login except on the fifth day you will get five evolution' charged the tenth day you will get five evolution shards and then the thirteenth day you will get three evolution crystals I'm assuming those are more rare than gems I have not used any of those yet personally I'm assuming that would help you evolve Pokemon though since they're called evolution shards and evolution crystals so if you're not playing masters and you're still debating about it 300 gems is a whole lot of gems that you get for free just by opening the app once a day there are also gem specials which are gems at a reduced price on sale for a limited time there are different packs there's just special pack one special pack two special pack three and you can buy those anytime between now and February 27th and there will be more content later there will be more content at the end of February according to the website and then chapters 22 through 24 have been added to will be added to the main story the date for those chapters will be February 24th at 10 p.m. they will be added new evolution sync pairs are gonna be added again on February 24th and then they just have some special updates for hey you can only log in once a day login bonuses are reset every day at 10:00 p.m. we hope you enjoy playing and then the other news which I guess is gonna be more exciting is from now until March 13th Professor Oak and Mew have been added to special missions by logging in during this time you will be able to team up with Professor Oak and mu and have their sync grid expanded there's also a special admission underway to power them up during this event Professor Oak will appear in the Pokemon Center with the sync pair mu it will team up there will also be sync pairs story detail and Professor Oak's journey to his to regain his passion as a trainer there will be the special missions like they did for Rayquaza and what was the other one before that Mewtwo no yes okay leo was before that and Mewtwo too had special missions but this this doesn't have special missions in the way people think it has special missions yes I I have not gotten there yet there isn't a storyline for professor oak there isn't an event that you go and click through that doesn't exist for Professor Oak I thought there was because they show him with like a knitter II know at one point there may be that there's somewhere that I haven't unlocked it but I've been playing with Professor Oak and I'm in my events and I do that see any special event specifically for Professor Oak it may happen when you get everything so according to the website it says you in order to get Professor Oak and Mew you have to complete chapter 1 to take on the special missions you have to complete chapter 2 Professor Oak and mucus in using custom items that can be attained by completing special missions which I don't know where those are yet all mission completion rewards are must be claimed within three days in order to claim them that's I don't know why you wouldn't claim your rewards once you complete it but I may be somebody forgot to a lock it's real easy to forget and they really hide where those rewards are on one screen and the there's no present no darou those are the event missions with a little bright ribbon the little ribbons that are hidden and then not in your face so unless you remember I have to go and specifically spend them and you have to go into the shop and then click to get to the right banner to spend them there it's really easy to forget that they have is it or how many you have it is not well advertised it's not in your face so it's very easy to not know how many you have or think I've spent surely I have spent them all I have not spent them all wait did the daily vouchers you get every day do they expire yep oh I should probably be using them then okay well the the event ones do as far as know the daily ones the ones that you get to power up yourself don't oh okay okay okay but like the me event ones will expire when this event is over three days after this event is over which is what March 3rd that what they said something like that oh yeah because it says I have um I have 60 66 in stock and I'm pretty sure that oak knee Torino thing is from his sync story which isn't everybody gets a sync sorry it's not oh I got it it's in his sync sorry I believe ok I haven't done a sync story yet so to unlock the sync grid feature you must complete the main story of chapter 11:2 event the event to team up with mr. oak and me you may be held again in the future I would hope so I missed out on me too the special event mission to strengthen oak may be held again in the future to acquire professor oak and Mew through exchange items out you can power them up by exchanging items yeah so you can only power up oak and mu through completing missions and how come you don't use your regular supply of powerup items they use specific Professor Oak items that you can only get during this event which if you've done for old stuff like like rayquaza right you could only get dragon tickets or whatever if you go in to your move sync up and you're like well I have you know 50 you know horns and a hundred million sodas I can surely upgrade you can't because it requires special oak sodas and special Oh corns the old oak color yeah I so like you have to complete the events to power it up you can't use your existing stock and you you were saying that you weren't enjoying the oak and Mew event is it again I haven't done it but I did do the I did do a little bit of the rayquaza and a little bit of the so gaily oh I didn't find them super grindy but I also didn't power them up nearly the I was at 20 out of 20 I think oh yeah 2 or 3 out of 20 so there's a couple of things the first time you play with oak gets fun the 100th time you're playing with oak and mu it's less fun the issue is is how they built oak which is exciting the first couple of times you play with it but then it's like so one of the special abilities you unlock is it will randomly lower our targets one of their stats when you successfully hit and so sometimes it's very beneficial sometimes it's very much not so there's a huge amount of Swing and playing with oak and Moo when you do the sync move the first time you lose access to your moves and they're replaced with different moves so the first time you do that if you weren't planning for that to happen suddenly like if you're like I was gonna use my X beat a couple you know one more time but I'll do that after my sync you lose access to EXPEED when you do that you also lose access to the other ability it has a world of dreams they disappear and are replaced by different moves so it's cool the first time but also like oh I really should have used all those things before I got here oh sorry did it didn't warn me that I was suddenly gonna be faced with completely different moves and none of them are buffing moves they're all attack moves then depending on who you're fighting month at many of them aren't gonna be worth it it's I was surprised that oak started as a three star it seems underwhelming to have it be the lowest level of stars like oh okay and then I have to use items that I've gotten only through summoning or by spending my other event tickets in very specific ways to be able to power up to four stars and then I have to do all that again to try to get oak to five stars I think all the star stuff is so weird and misleading like there's no water two stars and it's light you can get a three star to be a five star but people only care about five stars yeah well because the five stars have frankly just better stats like there's no denying that if you're gonna use oak you want to get it to five stars to get access to it being a powerhouse the sort of issue is that so where I am in the game having to go back and do level one normal level courses things that when I pop in there it says you need a power level of two thousand and my team is twenty thousand I still have to go through the two minutes of running this battle because that's the mission that I have to complete and I have to complete that five times and there's no challenge it's just me literally saying click here and then I set down my phone for two minutes and then come back and it's done and I have to do that a lot of times on each level and ultimately I just started going back and saying who do I have it like level ten that I don't care about that I'm just gonna throw in there so that I have something to do to make this interesting that I'm not just steamrolling this content because I'm not allowed to skip it I have to do it to power up oak and Moo because there's no way I can't use any of my other items I can't use my regular stuff to power up mu I have to do these I know I have to do these missions and the missions that I have to do the first 40 of them were no challenge at all it was just me literally reading my email and then when I saw that the animations finished hitting battle again hit Auto because there was no way I could possibly lose I was so over power but then you realize way down in the list that you have to attack with muse psychic 70 times to get one of the things and it's like okay so I have to find one that allows me to survive use muse psychic 70 times use muse synch move like think like 20 times I found right there drag and so the challenge is surviving the grind and that's a real tough challenge to be honest because it's not it's not particularly fun to do that like I'm not getting a new story I'm not like when I was doing the grass event and when I was doing the the zinnia event like there was a storyline to do that and like I was moving up through things and I was inform things professor oak just shows up and it's like do all your old content but now with professor oak and mu and it's like this is content that I've been playing ever since this game has come out I have done all of these hundreds of hundreds and times and now I have to do them again in this short window to be able to use this character effectively and to their max potential it's not bad the first ten times I did it but like I'm on I think I have to do very hard levels forty times after you the same thing forty times in a row to max it out and there's no challenge there I will blow through it I have done this very hard level already 50 times I just now have to sit and actually interface with the game because I can't trust Auto at those levels to do it well and I have to do it 40 times and it's just it's hard for me who have who know that grinding isn't good content grinding is just extending time that I have to interact with your game and it's not more fun more grind isn't more fun for me it's just a grunt so my question is this is definitely different than the last the Rayquaza stuff absolutely it's completely different yet alright bar you saying you like the rick ways and stuff more i know they're both rindy like that's obvious but there was like a progression with the Rayquaza stuff and then you hit a similar grind and I think that's the biggest problem with the game because towards the end of the require event I had to do clear team break option through or whatever yeah 20 times to get past the first bingo and I'm like I don't enjoy this fight enough I did it ten times and at the end of the ten times I'm like I'm so tired of doing this and Rick ways it isn't worth it like this is not a good sync pair it's an oak casing pair but it's not good by any means why am I doing this and it's really early to tell if mu will be worth it the randomness that mu adds is interesting I can't tell if that is going to be good for the game going forward since you have very little control over what happens yeah it's sort of like do I take this risk and hope it works out in our favor or do I go with Olivia who gives a constant steady predictable ramping element that is trustworthy I don't know the answer that we're still very into it but um like it was fun to see like I haven't done the sync stories all their sync stories are charming so that'll be fine yeah that's like the best part of masters is like the characters interacting the Steven stone in Wallis event which is super fun and it's fun to see them interact is sort of like this weird story while Miu is there and it's sort of like hey here's the musing that you want but you're getting no story here's this even stone and Wallis story that's really fun to read and their interactions are great but you have to randomly hopefully get Steven stone in one of your poles oh and Barrett berry knows yeah I love the like reference of like oh those two are yep they're definitely a couple they're definitely a couple it was very cool like we out we for some reason every time we come up bring up masters we always talk about this huge crime and we never talk about like the nice good things that it's doing which is like I will say that like the story moments are fantastic like I loved the Steven stone sorry you got to use Steven stone even if you don't have him in your party the interactions are charming Steven stone asking slightly sketchy questions about the stones in the rock leaders gym what is his name clay yeah like that part was real weird like who tell me about the stoats in your hair at least he didn't ask to touch his hair play you're talking about the guy from X&Y the rock farmer got away name I have died don't remember what his name is you love X&Y I do that doesn't mean I remember the name of every gym leader oh man I have to look it up because it's gonna pick cliff I feel like it's grant grant it's grant rights grant that's a little like ooh don't don't ask don't ask one of the few person of colors NPC about well how they do their hair white boy like please don't yeah those things are fun like the thing that's deceptive about masters is the introduction is fun like it's fun to see them it's fun to hear them they do voice great voice acting when they create a story the story is fun when the sync pair off stuff is fun that's all fun and then you get to the end of it and it's like well we don't have something coming up for awhile so just grind I mean I've had meetings with DNA and I think I'm not speaking for DNA but I think they're still trying to figure out right that balance and you can see them in the game like you don't have to talk to DNA to like realize like every time they've done this event first it was Mewtwo and then they came out and they apologized that Mewtwo was to grindy and they said they would make it easier and for the most part the soul gaia'leo event which I think was the second one people were like this is way better yes but not perfect and then Rayquaza event they added the bingo stuff yeah so they listened and they they tried something different and now this new event well I haven't done it yet what Gregg explained made sense of like okay now this is different yeah so they're they've they they didn't they haven't done the same thing every - they're trying right they're trying and I think they will eventually get there the problem is that they really are relying on a lot of things grinding so like I'll explain this so at the same time that this is happening there is a Master Hunter event happening in their direct competitor gah Gilles sorry Alice listeners and both to do the end content to do the high end raids you don't get to skip that you have to do them so I will freely admit there is a grind in regalia lost to do the high end content but only the high end content so I can't skip the expert level of the what's the big dragons wrangles breathless like I don't get to skip that great but I also don't have to go back to the lower levels and completely place through those levels to get the ability to power up the characters that they introduced to this event so when I pulled that person I then didn't have to go back and say I have to run the leveling up thing I got to skip that I got to say I just need things to get this person to a place where I can play with them and I think that's the difference like if I had the ability to skip the lower levels of the mute ickett part and only have to do the high levels it wouldn't feel so bad yeah but the fact that I have to go so far back and I don't have a way to just say I've done this let me pass this part I don't mind having to do the tough part on my own I don't mind having to do the co-op stuff that is just a given that you shouldn't be able to skip past the hard content let me get past the easy content don't make me do easy things because it's it's not hiding the fact that it's just filler because I've done that and people who are leveling up have to do that great they don't have they don't get to skip because that is the highest level content that they have to do and I think that's the difference between the two games why I don't hate doing the grind replaying the Rathalos fight and the other rare super extra dragon to be on that fight because the rest of the game I get to just say I've done this and I'm past it and I can focus on the thing that I want to do the new hard content and with masters not only do I not have do it not just have to focus on the hard content but I have to do all of the easy content as well and I have to spend a lot of time in there like doing easy raid five times sounds like well that's nothing that's only ten minutes if I only had ten minutes to play a mobile game like that's a lot of time for a mobile game to eat up my time like I have to date it and that's just step one I think that is where some of my discomfort with masters comes in because they at this point they do a lot of things right like we're getting enough gems that when you pull up when you have a bad poll it's not as soul-crushing anymore because you're getting gems on a more regular basis I still think they should guarantee a four star if you're doing a ten poll but that's splitting hairs the characters that they put in are all charming they all make sense the voice work is amazing it's a charming game that's dragged down by their inability to give up this idea that the only way to interact with their game is to grind everything else is great and it could be such a top-tier game if they could just let that go yeah I'm not sure if that's like we have to rework something in the backend or I mean it probably is and I'm not saying it's an easy fix but it is when I when I sit down in my morning break and I'm reading my email at work and I think I have to got two games in front of me which I want to go my immediate reaction when I look at masters is I just can't handle that grind right now I'm gonna go to the other one and I have such a stronger attachment to Pokemon my instincts are to play that one because I love that universe I love those characters I love the way it's presented but I just know that half of my experience isn't going to be fun whereas I can go to drag a Yost and I have no attachment to this characters they're all new to me and there's ones that I love and I know I can spend the exact same ten minutes between the two games and I will get a hundred percent more out of the one that I will the other and that's just a problem in that marketplace but I will say this they are definitely trying to prove the game that's what keeps me coming back I know they are working hard like I can already tell that they have made a lot of changes and a lot of those changes are good like I am no longer in the camp of saying don't play Pokemon masters I am in the camp of play it but it's not gonna be your number one game because once you've completed all the fun stuff then that fun stuff starts but it is a better game than it was when it started and I think I think they are getting to a a good place with it I just think there are some there are some design things that I don't agree with and I don't know I don't know their thinking behind it so these are just my my thoughts about yeah like and and professor oka me is fun like I like using them and they're like that all their interactions are cute but it's still like okay here we go how you gonna sit down like I really tried to burn through it on when it first came out and I was like two hours in and I was nowhere near completing everything I'm like I gotta be done this is this is makin oh this is this is rough well you can finish the me stuff just by spending money Greg true which will never happen no III have I like masters but I am I'm definitely like I do my dailies and that's kind of it and I have a good time with that I'm just like okay cuz every day the what is it the daily Scout things switch yep yeah and that's pretty much all i do i do my dailies I get my new characters and I move on but I know some people are they want to get all their characters up to 120 they want the every move unlocked which is totally fair way to play it's just I I'm not that hardcore yeah we need to get back we need to resuscitate will back into into life is I've been listening to this whole thing and I'm keep evaluating whether I'm gonna start playing this game or not you don't have to start well you just have to log in every day to get your gems and then if you decide to start playing you'll be like wow I have 30,000 gems I can pull to my heart's content right I have 34,000 gems right now because the last time I pulled was Cynthia and I was able to get Cynthia very easily so sometimes as we know I'm so mad and I find that I really just got Karen so sometimes I don't think I have Karen so sometimes this week I'm gonna try to pull for first Steven stone and his gayness really comes out in this game which I love yeah I love it also a lot of people are like I'm gonna wait for the six month because if red and whatever else is coming as a poll that's sort of that sort of a thing that people are talking about like I don't want to pull for Steven stone because we know the big thing is coming oh yeah but if I do get Steven stone in one poll then you save your gems for red yeah I haven't I didn't I didn't even get Cynthia so bite me okay okay okay uh question of the week Greg all right are you ready I'm ready is this be topical okay when I think of home I think of a place where there are Pokemon overflowing I'll put this one there I'll send that one someplace well I have no way of knowing is this worth the money that I'm paying is this all worse than people are saying surprise trades are still bleak let's just hear the question of the week there's an effort put into this one I mean there's that for denial except for yeah that's rude go Brandon says do you have any stories or really cool of a really cool or memorable Pokemon that you forgotten about with home releasing I found three shiny volcanic son game when I saw them I left and I remembered I got them from buying a copy of son on eBay and realized they were a hacked that's actually a really good story I mean yes I just went into a copy of X that I found that I had hidden in one of I had put it in my ultramoon case and I realized that there was a person standing at the counter when I went in there like oh I've never collected any of these mystery gifts so he'd spent 10 minutes clicking you like your party's full all right drop them all and come back keep going here's your meloetta it's been sitting here for five years oh I mean I forgot because I have two copies of X I forgot I had two copies of X because I clearly had 102 copies of X I wanted to do a Nuzlocke and I didn't want to reset X and I think target was having a sale like buy one get one free so I had a different game that I bought I'm like well just pick up X for free and so I did and like I'll just run this and then I promptly forgot that I did that and put it into a case hmm so I've been fine it was a Steve move cuz you did that too I have yeah I've done that too so I've been finding all of these mythical x' oh and the other thing is uh brent was like okay this is a huge outside this four sword and shield breaks is still playing sword and shield which is amazing amazing to me but like he saw I sent him to list of things that could be transferred over now and I'm like are they any that you want because I want Ike have access to everything it's like who I really want Marsh shadow and I'm like I think I have two and I did so I traded him one of my martial so that's like sweet of you yeah it's just like those things of finding those in me later you're a pet he's like what do you want my just give me that's a fair GTS trade right there Marsh shadow frittata but like those things being able to do those things are real that there are a lot of fun like I've been enjoying that I've been going through all my old games and seeing which mythical zyv left behind I found Chinese that I'd left behind that I'm like I should bring sums up so I've been having a bunch of my shiny Rosalia's in there now so no I mean when I put stuff in Pokemon bank I I did a lot of cleanup and I didn't leave anything behind on any cartridges ah that's cool so I mean no I mean I I have my living decks that you know I'll be happy to move over but I mean eventually I would like to get mail metal if up in there sand Melton so I could have my real living decks but that's about it Mel metals are the real popular thing on the dts by the way yep or just like if you're missing if you're missing marsh shadow or you're missing meloetta or you're missing Victini people will trade those for a mell metal a lot of those people just don't wanna play pokemon go and it's funny cuz people because it's like you can open a melt an box every three days and right now it's double candy by the time this podcast goes up it's still double candy if you're listening to it on Monday morning and that ends at 10:00 p.m. so you can catch 18 melt hands with double candy and and pin at berries and get close I have like four or five Mel medals I'm not missing any any mythical z-- but that's a fair trip that's actually a fair trade like hey I will trade you up Victini for a ML medal I do have a shiny male medal so that's a special ooh the the thing that I guess stands out for me is I spent a lot of time shiny hunting and ultrason all Turman and at one point I have cared about ribbons which there's now a ribbon guide on YouTube that I put up unfortunately it got damaged so it only uploaded a 480 version so I'm real upset about that but people are still happy with it but there's a guide on YouTube of how I specifically mark stuff which revolves around ribbons and Chinese and Eevee training and IV training but I was able to get about 30 shinies that I really cared about in ultrasone all tremendous many ribbons on them as I could and move them into Pokemon home and now almost all those Pokemon can go into a sword and shield so I can get the I think there are six or seven ribbons and sword and shield that I can now put on those Pokemon which I'm excited to do so and then of course my scraggy from the 2011 World Championships crafty sorry that I really really care about is is safe and sound in Pokemon home gay so that's now if you could only find it no I know where it is I know it is a real quick before we moved to Pokemon of the week in regards to Grand Oak this is actually a quote from Game Informer I'm not sure how long ago but Game Informer asked what's the deal with the Pokemon timeline and Masuda said it starts to get a little complicated if you pay too much attention to timelines like there might be a professor that appears and it wouldn't make sense at all if we applied it to some kind of timeline logic so we not we try not to apply it to regular rigorously maybe like one hint is that a character is appearing with Professor Oak they're living in the same error rather than some series where it makes sense to have a time line progress as you go and the story evolve the approach that Pokemon takes is an expand is expanding the world like what regions are and making it richer as we go rather than a time line it's more of a physical space thing that's like a non-answer yeah no I mean they did the thing where Zelda should have done and say like hey maybe the time line doesn't matter too much but Zelda fans were like no it must matter and it's like did better yeah I don't know they really messed up like it kind of the Pokemon timeline kind of made sense until Omega Ruby alpha sapphire and they were like ah well now all of a sudden Wallace has a mega and we're gonna wreak on his pokemon from Gardevoir to make a goal a heat it's fine though they gave guard ported d antha or whatever her name is diantha correct it is together diantha well pokemon of the week alright last week's Pokemon it was a listicle and I'll just give you the highlights number 10 signature abilities

a lowland right you lowland bright you I'm so glad that you cover these things up because I lost my notes it was like I was texting people friends of ours are like do you have the dose because I write them down and I can't buy my notes so I came in prepared I had to ask run cuz I lost my notepad but I got it you should have just had it immediately from last week it was just so obvious and I wrote it down and then I promptly forgot about it because I forget everything that I write down and then when I went to go look at Lee right she's like the only pancake Pokemon out there well stunfisk looks like a pancake it looks like a pancake but it doesn't enjoy eating pink well we don't know that sir the CB can learn surf mean San Jose muddy water yeah I denied it look psychic tape she's got a real

right she's cool I like a low low not you a lot I do too that's one of the is one of the good designs it's just underused yeah out there somewhere I've been seeing him in raids floatin now I don't pay attention to raids our point of the week it's almost a three-hour show I got to figure out how to cut an hour from this there has recently recently been a lot of talk in the Pokemon go communities about trade evolutions these are pokemons that only evolve when they are traded this concept has existed since the very first Pokemon games but it has also taken on varying forms the Pokemon that currently benefit from trade evolution in Pokemon go are Kadabra Machoke gravel ER hunter bull door girder kara blast and shell mitt most of these represent the standard trade evolution just trade them and when they appear on the other side they begin to evolve in the Pokemon video games Kara blastin shellman would only evolve if you traded one for the other a unique situation there are other types of trade evolutions though that are not currently available in Pokemon go and that have recently been brought to mind by my experiences using Invisalign how much happier I would be if I could just get my teeth to evolve to the final straight form some examples of varying trade evolutions include onyx to steelix which evolves when traded with a metal coat or right on to our IP riyer which evolves when holding a protector this week's Pokemon is a result of this type of trade evolution as I mentioned my experiences with Invisalign had me thinking of the deep-sea tooth an item that when held by Clamperl allows it to evolve into one of its two final forms if you choose to have Clamperl hold the deep-sea tooth before evolving it will double Clamperl special attack you may or may not be aware that Pokemon have various leveling rates plant pearl and it's evolutions all follow the erratic leveling rate this rate allows pokémon to evolve the fastest of all leveling rates there you go
