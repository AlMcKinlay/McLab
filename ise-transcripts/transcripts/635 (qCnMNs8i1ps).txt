oh right I am recording B yeah I am also (0:01 - 0:08)
recording B sorry that&#39;s what I was (0:05 - 0:10)
waiting (0:08 - 0:10)
for what&#39;s up everyone welcome to the (0:20 - 0:26)
635th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:23 - 0:28)
it&#39;s super effective I&#39;m your host Steve (0:26 - 0:32)
with me is Hannah I&#39;m here I&#39;m in a new (0:28 - 0:34)
place again (0:32 - 0:37)
hello I do love this recurring theme of (0:34 - 0:39)
you just always being in a different (0:37 - 0:41)
place it&#39;s (0:39 - 0:44)
not (0:41 - 0:47)
easy it&#39;s fine it is what it (0:44 - 0:52)
is uh Bobby also here okay I have an (0:47 - 0:55)
idea for a web series and if the Pokemon (0:52 - 0:57)
company is listening they should really (0:55 - 0:59)
take note of this hear me out it&#39;s (0:57 - 1:01)
lechon and wulu (0:59 - 1:03)
and the web series is called farming and (1:01 - 1:05)
the chunk and wulu are left to run a (1:03 - 1:07)
farm after the owner of the farm leaves (1:05 - 1:10)
for vacation and then all hij Jinks (1:07 - 1:13)
ensue and it just is like a wild time (1:10 - 1:17)
did you just read Animal Farm (1:13 - 1:17)
res no but it could absolutely happen (1:18 - 1:26)
Eight Episodes maybe six and it would be (1:21 - 1:28)
great it&#39; be wonderful I could see it (1:26 - 1:30)
being one of those one-off shorts that (1:28 - 1:31)
they some sometimes just put up randomly (1:30 - 1:35)
there was a Wu btime story that they put (1:31 - 1:39)
up recently for Pokemon sleep I (1:35 - 1:42)
think one of those it&#39;s perfect with (1:39 - 1:45)
Galler coming back to go and Pala still (1:42 - 1:46)
being a (1:45 - 1:52)
thing it works out perfectly yeah sure (1:46 - 1:55)
guess okay so uh the next two episode (1:52 - 1:57)
this episode and next week&#39;s episode (1:55 - 2:00)
going to be a little weird uh and we&#39;re (1:57 - 2:02)
kind of recording both at the same time (2:00 - 2:03)
so if you&#39;re watching this episode and (2:02 - 2:06)
then you watch 636 we might be in the (2:03 - 2:07)
same close that&#39;s cuz we&#39;ve recorded (2:06 - 2:11)
them the same day but um we&#39;re also (2:07 - 2:13)
supposed to have a special guest either (2:11 - 2:15)
this episode or next episode depending (2:13 - 2:18)
on how fast I can edit and record uh so (2:15 - 2:20)
there might be a special guest after the (2:18 - 2:22)
break and if there&#39;s not it&#39;ll probably (2:20 - 2:24)
be next week but I think it&#39;s gon to be (2:22 - 2:26)
this (2:24 - 2:29)
week but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll figure that out uh (2:26 - 2:30)
for those that don&#39;t know I just wanted (2:29 - 2:33)
to do my disclosure here uh I am (2:30 - 2:36)
traveling to Indonesia specifically (2:33 - 2:41)
Jakarta this week which is a 30ish hour (2:36 - 2:44)
flight including like a 15h hour layover (2:41 - 2:48)
so I&#39;m pretty much two hours not two (2:44 - 2:51)
hours two days of my life will be to get (2:48 - 2:55)
to Jakarta um I get like a layover in (2:51 - 2:58)
Japan for like 15 hours so that&#39;s like (2:55 - 2:59)
not it&#39;s like not the worst layover (2:58 - 3:02)
that&#39;s not bad airport in Japan uh Hana (2:59 - 3:05)
or Han hanada Hana yeah I think it&#39;s (3:02 - 3:08)
close enough yeah it&#39;s one of though (3:05 - 3:09)
it&#39;s in between one of those (3:08 - 3:11)
pronunciations uh (3:09 - 3:14)
somewhere some syllable needs to be (3:11 - 3:16)
adjusted on my you&#39;re close enough (3:14 - 3:18)
you&#39;re (3:16 - 3:20)
good I think it gives me enough time to (3:18 - 3:22)
go to like one or two stores and get (3:20 - 3:26)
pepper lunch I think that&#39;s the exent of (3:22 - 3:28)
my Japan experience yes that&#39;s what you (3:26 - 3:32)
do so I will say that that (3:28 - 3:36)
uh Niantic is paying for my flight there (3:32 - 3:40)
and my flight and my hotel they&#39;re kind (3:36 - 3:42)
of paying for my flight back that gets a (3:40 - 3:44)
little complicated because I&#39;m going to (3:42 - 3:47)
Korea afterwards and there are different (3:44 - 3:49)
Departments of Niantic that you have to (3:47 - 3:51)
deal with and they all have different (3:49 - 3:53)
budgets the American people have a (3:51 - 3:55)
different budget than the apack people (3:53 - 3:57)
that have a different budget it&#39;s me (3:55 - 3:59)
it&#39;s messy so that&#39;s just the disclosure (3:57 - 4:03)
there um for and why these episodes are (3:59 - 4:05)
a little messy uh but that being (4:03 - 4:08)
said I&#39;ll be streaming ideally if my (4:05 - 4:10)
internet&#39;s working so if you want to see (4:08 - 4:13)
what an event in Jakarta is like or you (4:10 - 4:15)
just want to see Jakarta because you can (4:13 - 4:18)
get a four-star hotel for like $40 USD a (4:15 - 4:21)
night there and that&#39;s crazy uh so if (4:18 - 4:23)
you want to see what Jakarta looks (4:21 - 4:25)
like I&#39;ll be streaming it and you can (4:23 - 4:27)
come in you can ask questions the dollar (4:25 - 4:29)
is very very if you think the dollar is (4:27 - 4:30)
strong in Japan (4:29 - 4:33)
the dollar is real strong in Indonesia (4:30 - 4:34)
holy (4:33 - 4:39)
cow uh so that&#39;s the next two weeks for (4:34 - 4:41)
twitch if you&#39;re this this upcoming (4:39 - 4:43)
weekend will be Jakarta and then the (4:41 - 4:45)
following weekend will be Korea so if (4:43 - 4:47)
you want to see Pokemon go live in those (4:45 - 4:49)
two countries there you go (4:47 - 4:51)
okay with that being said we got some (4:49 - 4:53)
Pokemon news for you starting off with (4:51 - 4:56)
the first bit of Pokemon news which is (4:53 - 4:59)
good sleep day now you might think (4:56 - 5:01)
there&#39;s always a good sleep day because (4:59 - 5:03)
there&#39;s always a full (5:01 - 5:06)
moon yep that&#39;s how it (5:03 - 5:09)
goes crazy that that Moon just it&#39;s just (5:06 - 5:12)
always there (5:09 - 5:12)
yep real good game mechanic uh they are (5:13 - 5:17)
saying this time though for this (5:15 - 5:19)
specific good sleep day which is uh the (5:17 - 5:22)
full moon is Wednesday September 18th if (5:19 - 5:23)
you&#39;re listening to this on a Monday or (5:22 - 5:26)
a Tuesday they are saying that uh the (5:23 - 5:28)
night of the full moon there&#39;s going to (5:26 - 5:30)
be a much greater appearance of Clefairy (5:28 - 5:32)
clefable and (5:30 - 5:35)
cleffa and there will be a great (5:32 - 5:37)
appearance on the 17th and 19th so much (5:35 - 5:40)
greater or just (5:37 - 5:42)
greater (5:40 - 5:47)
uh all right cool I I I I&#39;m looking at (5:42 - 5:51)
Pokemon sleep.now (5:47 - 5:51)
did (6:00 - 6:04)
for these three (6:02 - 6:07)
days and it doesn&#39;t say you need to go (6:04 - 6:10)
to green grass it is saying all areas so (6:07 - 6:12)
if you decide to go to topalo just (6:10 - 6:14)
because you like the music of topalo you (6:12 - 6:17)
should getair there the best music hands (6:14 - 6:20)
down I (6:17 - 6:20)
agree so there there&#39;s (6:20 - 6:26)
your there&#39;s your event I would we have (6:23 - 6:29)
no events after suun so I would (6:26 - 6:31)
assume in the next couple days there (6:29 - 6:33)
should be an event even if it&#39;s like one (6:31 - 6:36)
of those growth weeks yep real growth (6:33 - 6:38)
week (6:36 - 6:42)
yeah um is so Clefairy where does (6:38 - 6:45)
Clefairy usually spawn I would imagine (6:42 - 6:47)
topollo I think (6:45 - 6:51)
so I can&#39;t remember it made its debut (6:47 - 6:53)
somewhere there was probably green grass (6:51 - 6:54)
that made its debut but I don&#39;t think (6:53 - 6:56)
I&#39;ve ever seen a Clefairy or Clea or (6:54 - 6:57)
anything in the (6:56 - 7:00)
game I do kind of like I I don&#39;t think (6:57 - 7:01)
this is a mechanic but I do kind of like (7:00 - 7:05)
the concept of like certain Pokemon (7:01 - 7:08)
being missing until there&#39;s like a full (7:05 - 7:09)
moon because you can at least guarantee (7:08 - 7:11)
there&#39;s going to be a full moon every (7:09 - 7:14)
month and then those Pokemon come back (7:11 - 7:18)
yeah um because I don&#39;t they can keep (7:14 - 7:21)
adding new islands which they&#39;ve only (7:18 - 7:24)
added one since the game has come out (7:21 - 7:26)
they could keep adding new islands but (7:24 - 7:28)
they could also keep adding new Pokemon (7:26 - 7:31)
but (7:28 - 7:31)
like it&#39;s almost like a Pokemon go thing (7:33 - 7:36)
where they feels like they almost have (7:35 - 7:40)
to like rotate Pokemon out or I kind of (7:36 - 7:42)
wish they would rotate Pokemon out (7:40 - 7:44)
because I&#39;m kind of tired of seeing (7:42 - 7:46)
ekins yeah it&#39;s just everywhere since (7:44 - 7:48)
since you like only see so many a day (7:46 - 7:51)
like you can only see so many a day so (7:48 - 7:54)
it it as they add more and more and more (7:51 - 7:56)
it could become a bit of a problem if (7:54 - 7:58)
there aren&#39;t like certain times when (7:56 - 8:00)
they&#39;ve rotated certain ones out if (7:58 - 8:01)
they&#39;re not adding like to your point if (8:00 - 8:03)
they&#39;re not adding more Islands (8:01 - 8:05)
eventually they probably will though I (8:03 - 8:07)
don&#39;t necessarily want them to do it in (8:05 - 8:08)
the same way that Pokemon go has I&#39;m (8:07 - 8:11)
still kind of dissatisfied by the way (8:08 - 8:13)
Pokemon go does (8:11 - 8:15)
that like if you&#39;re working on like the (8:13 - 8:18)
r the rata metal and then there&#39;s like (8:15 - 8:21)
no rata for the next six months yeah (8:18 - 8:22)
sometimes you just can&#39;t come across a (8:21 - 8:25)
Pokemon that you want to find (8:22 - 8:29)
yeah um so I&#39;m sorry just looking this (8:25 - 8:31)
up and I don&#39;t know how I just didn&#39;t (8:29 - 8:32)
never remember this apparently I&#39;ve (8:31 - 8:35)
studied nine Clea I have all four sleep (8:32 - 8:39)
Styles but I never caught any of them so (8:35 - 8:42)
I guess I have seen Clea in the people (8:39 - 8:45)
really metronome as an (8:42 - 8:47)
ability probably yeah it would make (8:45 - 8:49)
sense it&#39;s just like fun for them to (8:47 - 8:51)
have something different every time I (8:49 - 8:53)
like metronom I like using it with like (8:51 - 8:55)
just throwing a toap in there from time (8:53 - 8:58)
to time and met metronome is a fun (8:55 - 9:02)
mechanic uh how was your how was your (8:58 - 9:04)
suun week (9:02 - 9:09)
Hannah I was moving so the first week I (9:04 - 9:13)
didn&#39;t really play um the second week I (9:09 - 9:16)
did the bare minimum and that was at (9:13 - 9:18)
first on accident and then I kind of (9:16 - 9:20)
decided I kind of want to see if I can (9:18 - 9:23)
still get a suun while doing the bare (9:20 - 9:25)
minimum now what I consider the bare (9:23 - 9:28)
minimum is recording the sleep each (9:25 - 9:31)
night and beating Snorlax at least once (9:28 - 9:34)
a day okay that&#39;s it doesn&#39;t mean (9:31 - 9:36)
tapping on any of my Pokemon doesn&#39;t (9:34 - 9:38)
mean Gathering any berries or any (9:36 - 9:41)
ingredients or any of that just sleep (9:38 - 9:43)
and at least one meal and I did get a (9:41 - 9:46)
suun and I did get the skill seed and I (9:43 - 9:48)
was able to get a good number of the (9:46 - 9:52)
candies and oh and checking in with (9:48 - 9:54)
friends and all of that so that&#39;s that&#39;s (9:52 - 9:56)
also bare because I was getting some (9:54 - 9:59)
sweet [ __ ] man that way so (9:56 - 10:03)
I did get only one suun but I was (9:59 - 10:05)
playing the bare minimum through the (10:03 - 10:07)
second week and didn&#39;t play at all the (10:05 - 10:10)
first week and I still got a suun so I&#39;m (10:07 - 10:14)
pretty happy with that yeah yeah that&#39;s (10:10 - 10:17)
great I&#39;m starting to settle a little (10:14 - 10:20)
bit more to clarify you didn&#39;t use a (10:17 - 10:22)
Master biscuit on the suun right no I (10:20 - 10:26)
had to use two incense because the first (10:22 - 10:28)
time it showed up I got it almost all (10:26 - 10:30)
the way but it still needed one more H (10:28 - 10:33)
biscuit got it got (10:30 - 10:39)
it uh yeah my week has been fine I went (10:33 - 10:44)
I went to Beach and uh I just used one (10:39 - 10:47)
more incense to spawn a suun just to see (10:44 - 10:49)
if it would be I was just GNA if it was (10:47 - 10:51)
going to if it was hungry or like (10:49 - 10:53)
somehow was shiny that I was going to (10:51 - 10:55)
then try to like catch a second one but (10:53 - 10:58)
it was not so um I did get all the other (10:55 - 11:00)
stuff though from (10:58 - 11:01)
all the main I collected so I got the (11:00 - 11:04)
skill seed the stone the water stone all (11:01 - 11:08)
the handy candy all the water candy uh (11:04 - 11:10)
and I think I&#39;ll probably get one more (11:08 - 11:12)
incense just to hold on to for some (11:10 - 11:16)
future potential suun spawn for some (11:12 - 11:21)
reason I uh I went to lapis oh how was (11:16 - 11:24)
that miserable oh (11:21 - 11:26)
no did you get your Ralts any Ralts by (11:24 - 11:29)
chance I got one Ralts all week okay (11:26 - 11:33)
okay good no it was not it was main main (11:29 - 11:37)
main skill down no um I also got one den (11:33 - 11:40)
all week okay but I think get triny (11:37 - 11:42)
Dratini also bad (11:40 - 11:45)
W but (11:42 - 11:48)
um I this is the highest I&#39;ve been at (11:45 - 11:51)
lapis which uh as of this morning I&#39;m La (11:48 - 11:56)
I&#39;m Master ranked 10 uh on lapis which I (11:51 - 11:59)
don&#39;t feel like like I don&#39;t feel like (11:56 - 12:02)
I&#39;m seeing new Pokemon at master rank n (11:59 - 12:04)
7 8 n at all that I like there&#39;s there&#39;s (12:02 - 12:07)
nothing new I&#39;ve gotten um I wish I saw (12:04 - 12:09)
more to den I wish I saw more roals I (12:07 - 12:13)
don&#39;t know if like the Pala Pokemon are (12:09 - 12:14)
somehow boosted but I feel like I&#39;ve (12:13 - 12:17)
just seen so many quackley and quaw well (12:14 - 12:20)
all week I guess they&#39;re water but like (12:17 - 12:22)
there&#39;s other water Pokemon but I just (12:20 - 12:24)
feel like the the Pala Pokemon still (12:22 - 12:27)
kind of like dominate lapis interesting (12:24 - 12:29)
in a way (12:27 - 12:32)
uh which isn&#39;t like the worst but also I (12:29 - 12:34)
haven&#39;t gotten a good quackley yet (12:32 - 12:38)
either oh yeah that&#39;s a I got a quackley (12:34 - 12:41)
with helping bonus and Berry finding s (12:38 - 12:43)
and I was like you&#39;re not a berry man (12:41 - 12:44)
your (12:43 - 12:48)
ingredients oh that&#39;s a bummer uh (12:44 - 12:51)
but (12:48 - 12:53)
I I think I think I could have gotten (12:51 - 12:58)
higher on lapis if I had a better meal (12:53 - 13:00)
uh I had dessert BS which originally (12:58 - 13:02)
when I got to lapis I had Curry and I&#39;m (13:00 - 13:05)
like this is my fifth week of (13:02 - 13:07)
Curry and I should have probably tried (13:05 - 13:09)
to roll for salads but I rolled once and (13:07 - 13:11)
I got desserts and the two other berries (13:09 - 13:13)
that came with the water Berry were just (13:11 - 13:16)
I I I I just couldn&#39;t match them um at (13:13 - 13:20)
all so that was hurtful I again I I (13:16 - 13:22)
think I said this last week but I barely (13:20 - 13:25)
ran like the the water Pokemon I ran for (13:22 - 13:28)
both weeks were just Blastoise (13:25 - 13:32)
and like Whooper not Whooper Quagsire (13:28 - 13:36)
mhm and that was kind of it yeah cuz I&#39;m (13:32 - 13:39)
like using other Pokemon to like fill in (13:36 - 13:43)
the the ingredient holes yep exactly (13:39 - 13:45)
that was me too like my only water (13:43 - 13:47)
Pokemon I was mostly using well I did (13:45 - 13:50)
put suun on the team but I was using (13:47 - 13:52)
quaw and (13:50 - 13:55)
then I would use some like from time to (13:52 - 13:58)
time I was putting in like Blastoise uh (13:55 - 14:00)
or you know (13:58 - 14:02)
I was or maybe for alligator from time (14:00 - 14:03)
to time but like for the most part I was (14:02 - 14:05)
using I was using other stuff just (14:03 - 14:06)
because I was trying to get the (14:05 - 14:08)
ingredients because I&#39;m I have salads (14:06 - 14:11)
this week and so just trying to level up (14:08 - 14:13)
like ninja salad you know so it&#39;s like (14:11 - 14:15)
okay well I need all these ingredients (14:13 - 14:18)
and they don&#39;t have them on water (14:15 - 14:20)
Pokemon you know like they have leak (14:18 - 14:22)
they have large leak on quaw well so I&#39;m (14:20 - 14:24)
like that&#39;s great that&#39;s keeping me (14:22 - 14:25)
using that but like otherwise I need (14:24 - 14:27)
other Pokemon that aren&#39;t water Pokemon (14:25 - 14:30)
so I can make these meals which which is (14:27 - 14:32)
a little frustrating yeah my my quag (14:30 - 14:34)
zire is triple mushroom which is (14:32 - 14:37)
fantastic but not for desserts because (14:34 - 14:38)
like literally one dessert that uses (14:37 - 14:41)
mushroom and it&#39;s like that tea really (14:38 - 14:42)
should have rerolled I should have (14:41 - 14:44)
rerolled yeah I thought I thought though (14:42 - 14:47)
like because I I had so because (14:44 - 14:48)
sometimes I rotated slow King in and (14:47 - 14:51)
slow King was like Slowpoke tail cacao (14:48 - 14:53)
and Blastoise is like all milk and like (14:51 - 14:56)
like milk is mostly used in dessert so I (14:53 - 14:58)
was like maybe desserts will be fine it (14:56 - 15:00)
was not fine but that&#39;s okay I feel like (14:58 - 15:03)
milk isn&#39;t used in any of the higher (15:00 - 15:07)
Point desserts though yes yeah yeah (15:03 - 15:08)
because it&#39;s one of those starter (15:07 - 15:11)
ingredients from the very beginning and (15:08 - 15:13)
for alligator was like sausage and it&#39;s (15:11 - 15:15)
like literally no desserts use (15:13 - 15:17)
sausage yeah you really you should have (15:15 - 15:19)
just kept curries if because like if you (15:17 - 15:21)
were rolling through five weeks of Curry (15:19 - 15:22)
you probably have a bunch of stuff (15:21 - 15:24)
leveled up already so like I did but I (15:22 - 15:26)
wanted I wanted to work on my desserts (15:24 - 15:30)
as well I don&#39;t know that&#39;s fair I (15:26 - 15:32)
continuing to use my good Vaporeon that (15:30 - 15:35)
I have a pretty solid Vaporeon and (15:32 - 15:38)
through this week I mean I said I hadn&#39;t (15:35 - 15:40)
necessarily been tapping on Pokemon when (15:38 - 15:42)
I did Vaporeon would just double skill (15:40 - 15:44)
trigger and fill my ingredients bag (15:42 - 15:46)
right on back up and it was great I (15:44 - 15:49)
forgot VOR I forgot eeve is a skills (15:46 - 15:50)
Pokemon I need to get a Vaporeon (15:49 - 15:53)
immediately I did not even think about (15:50 - 15:55)
that that it&#39;s skills Pokemon oh Jee (15:53 - 15:59)
it&#39;s so good um the other thing is I I (15:55 - 16:01)
got like I got two suun I could probably (15:59 - 16:03)
get a third suun tonight if I wanted to (16:01 - 16:05)
but I might just do incense and hold on (16:03 - 16:07)
to it and then I got the main skill seed (16:05 - 16:10)
I got the other thing I got the extra (16:07 - 16:12)
biscuits and then I thought to myself I (16:10 - 16:13)
was like (16:12 - 16:16)
man I thought I could buy a lot more (16:13 - 16:19)
compared to the past events did I did I (16:16 - 16:21)
really play this poorly and then I (16:19 - 16:23)
realized last night I never went into (16:21 - 16:26)
the reward screen and redeemed all of (16:23 - 16:27)
the (16:26 - 16:29)
main and I feel like there was more Main (16:27 - 16:31)
in these rewards than in the past yeah (16:29 - 16:34)
yeah cuz I went from like 300 last night (16:31 - 16:36)
to be like man I I just thought I would (16:34 - 16:38)
have more Main and then I redeemed it (16:36 - 16:39)
all and now I&#39;m up to like (16:38 - 16:43)
700 like I could buy so much wait you (16:39 - 16:45)
never redeemed the you mean you&#39;re like (16:43 - 16:47)
your missions yeah I never did the (16:45 - 16:50)
missions all week I just cuz I&#39;m that (16:47 - 16:53)
player that like doesn&#39;t tap on the um (16:50 - 16:54)
you know when you get the points every (16:53 - 16:57)
night and it&#39;s like plus 200 Points Plus (16:54 - 16:59)
like I&#39;ll just let it sit all week oh my (16:57 - 17:02)
God get up to9 plus yeah yeah yeah cuz (16:59 - 17:05)
that animation take so long it just you (17:02 - 17:06)
have it&#39;s like oh you&#39;re someone who (17:05 - 17:09)
just leaves the red bubble on your phone (17:06 - 17:12)
aren&#39;t you like you don&#39;t red bubbles (17:09 - 17:13)
cuz that&#39;s the that thing is what that&#39;s (17:12 - 17:15)
what gets me is like I have to get rid (17:13 - 17:17)
of anything that&#39;s like a notification (17:15 - 17:20)
oh I see bubble in any way I&#39;ve gotten (17:17 - 17:22)
to the point where I can leave the (17:20 - 17:24)
notification thing on the catch on the (17:22 - 17:28)
caught Pokemon one because that&#39;s just (17:24 - 17:30)
that&#39;s pretty much always been there MH (17:28 - 17:32)
but the animation that you can&#39;t stand (17:30 - 17:34)
Steve is actually the one that I don&#39;t (17:32 - 17:36)
have a problem with that&#39;s a very (17:34 - 17:39)
satisfying animation to me and so I&#39;m (17:36 - 17:41)
happy to click on that button the point (17:39 - 17:44)
animation so if you don&#39;t click on the (17:41 - 17:47)
point animation and it just builds every (17:44 - 17:48)
day and then eventually when it gets to (17:47 - 17:51)
999 plus so when you click on it does it (17:48 - 17:53)
actually show you all like does it (17:51 - 17:55)
actually increase by all of the points (17:53 - 17:56)
that you&#39;ve been missing out on oh (17:55 - 17:57)
that&#39;s that&#39;s a good feeling too though (17:56 - 18:01)
that&#39;s like yeah yeah the go so much no (17:57 - 18:03)
the number goes up it&#39;s satisfying I (18:01 - 18:05)
think that&#39;s still my biggest complaint (18:03 - 18:07)
with Pokemon sleep is the game itself (18:05 - 18:11)
the menus itself just feels slow still I (18:07 - 18:12)
know they I know they&#39;ve increased it (18:11 - 18:15)
since release where it&#39;s gotten a little (18:12 - 18:16)
bit better (18:15 - 18:17)
but (18:16 - 18:20)
um uh yeah it&#39;s just the game itself (18:17 - 18:22)
just feels a little slow still there I (18:20 - 18:24)
still do not want to go through the (18:22 - 18:26)
menus to click on my friends and open up (18:24 - 18:27)
and get those friends bonuses even (18:26 - 18:30)
though it&#39;s such a big bonus and such a (18:27 - 18:33)
big help going through the two clicks (18:30 - 18:36)
that it takes to get there takes so long (18:33 - 18:38)
it does it does take a while and then (18:36 - 18:39)
with the main near it because then you (18:38 - 18:43)
have the extra like where it like go (18:39 - 18:44)
switches over to like oh and you also (18:43 - 18:46)
got all this main from everybody takes (18:44 - 18:49)
like an extra bit of time there&#39;s one (18:46 - 18:53)
menu in Pokemon sleep that is very quick (18:49 - 18:55)
is it maybe opening up Pokemon like (18:53 - 18:57)
opening up the like going from like (18:55 - 19:01)
looking at Snorlax to clicking I think (18:57 - 19:04)
it&#39;s like the Pokemon storage not going (19:01 - 19:06)
into the Pokemon storage just the like (19:04 - 19:09)
going from looking at Snorlax to I don&#39;t (19:06 - 19:11)
think so I think the one I&#39;ve found (19:09 - 19:13)
that&#39;s quick is going to the shop when (19:11 - 19:15)
you&#39;re interacting with Pokemon in the (19:13 - 19:18)
morning yeah the store definitely loads (19:15 - 19:20)
quickly yeah yeah right I mean (19:18 - 19:22)
especially in in the morning when you (19:20 - 19:24)
are doing your research the store loads (19:22 - 19:26)
especially quickly and so I always (19:24 - 19:28)
actually intentionally try to claim my (19:26 - 19:30)
daily free free gift while I am doing my (19:28 - 19:33)
morning research because it takes less (19:30 - 19:37)
time to get free gift every morning yeah (19:33 - 19:39)
yeah I do that as well okay it&#39;s the (19:37 - 19:41)
main it&#39;s actually just the main menu so (19:39 - 19:43)
when you&#39;re Snorlax to clicking main (19:41 - 19:47)
menu That&#39;s immediate that is no load or (19:43 - 19:48)
anything but then when you click on (19:47 - 19:50)
anything in there you have the loading (19:48 - 19:52)
screen that takes a few seconds for (19:50 - 19:54)
everything right and it&#39;s like sometimes (19:52 - 19:55)
you click the wrong thing and you&#39;re (19:54 - 19:57)
like no no and you got to go back and (19:55 - 19:59)
then that&#39;s another loading screen it&#39;s (19:57 - 20:02)
just too many loading screens so I will (19:59 - 20:04)
say like that is the thing about Pokemon (20:02 - 20:06)
go that is great is that when you click (20:04 - 20:09)
anywhere it&#39;s so quick like compared to (20:06 - 20:12)
something like Pokemon sleep where it (20:09 - 20:14)
takes to Pokemon unite yeah I don&#39;t (20:12 - 20:16)
think nian gets enough credit well (20:14 - 20:18)
Niantic doesn&#39;t get a lot a lot of (20:16 - 20:19)
credit for anything but when Niantic did (20:18 - 20:23)
that huge like frame rate boost up that (20:19 - 20:26)
was huge when they did that and they (20:23 - 20:29)
just did it know yep I mean it kills (20:26 - 20:33)
your battery life but it feels amazing (20:29 - 20:35)
you do you do what you (20:33 - 20:38)
do I&#39;ve gone back to people who have not (20:35 - 20:39)
done the update to like help them catch (20:38 - 20:42)
a Pokemon or something and I&#39;m just like (20:39 - 20:45)
it&#39;s like a night and day different game (20:42 - 20:48)
and if Pokemon sleep ever gets an update (20:45 - 20:49)
like (20:48 - 20:51)
that I feel like they already have some (20:49 - 20:53)
frame rate settings in Pokemon sleep (20:51 - 20:56)
just doesn&#39;t help that much they do yeah (20:53 - 20:57)
I think (20:56 - 21:01)
so um okay to switch gears a little bit (20:57 - 21:04)
uh this was this was announced just like (21:01 - 21:06)
a day or two ago but there&#39;s going to be (21:04 - 21:09)
an exclusive Pokemon popup store in (21:06 - 21:11)
South Korea uh that&#39;s going to start (21:09 - 21:15)
this is off the official Pokemon Korean (21:11 - 21:17)
Twitter but also we have a bubble pedia (21:15 - 21:20)
article about it here but um it&#39;s going (21:17 - 21:22)
to start Monday September 23rd and run (21:20 - 21:26)
until Thursday October 10th if you don&#39;t (21:22 - 21:28)
know like Pokemon is super big in Korea (21:26 - 21:30)
and they have their own (21:28 - 21:33)
like Pokemon Korea is its own thing (21:30 - 21:34)
compared to like Pokemon Japan or (21:33 - 21:36)
Pokemon EU or the Pokemon company (21:34 - 21:38)
International which (21:36 - 21:45)
is US mostly MH uh but it will be (21:38 - 21:47)
opening up later this month at Starfield (21:45 - 21:49)
suan Shopping Center in South Korea (21:47 - 21:50)
featuring merchandise from traditional (21:49 - 21:53)
items from Korea culture themed after (21:50 - 21:56)
Eevee&#39;s Evolutions in Pikachu uh the (21:53 - 21:58)
products available will include a goblet (21:56 - 22:00)
a notebook a pen phone grips a metal (21:58 - 22:03)
stand a key ring folding (22:00 - 22:07)
screen like a almost like a dndd screen (22:03 - 22:09)
that&#39;s the best way I can explain (22:07 - 22:11)
it uh and then the pop-up store will be (22:09 - 22:13)
located on level one of tower atrium of (22:11 - 22:16)
Starfield suan and it will open from (22:13 - 22:19)
10:00 a.m. to 1000 p.m. daily between (22:16 - 22:23)
September 23rd and October 10th they are (22:19 - 22:25)
saying on the Twitter post that it is (22:23 - 22:27)
purchase limit three per person I don&#39;t (22:25 - 22:30)
know if that&#39;s like three goblets per (22:27 - 22:32)
person or like (22:30 - 22:34)
three of one of each item per person (22:32 - 22:38)
they&#39;re not very clear there uh (22:34 - 22:43)
I&#39;m assuming that the timing here is (22:38 - 22:43)
because the Safari Zone is also (22:44 - 22:52)
happening that time frame uh but looking (22:48 - 22:54)
this up on a map which is kind of hard (22:52 - 22:56)
because Google Maps is not very (22:54 - 22:59)
intuitive for South Korea (22:56 - 23:02)
uh it is about a 90minut train ride from (22:59 - 23:05)
inchon where the Pokemon go event is (23:02 - 23:06)
happening (23:05 - 23:10)
to um this (23:06 - 23:11)
mall (23:10 - 23:13)
so uh convenient for me because I&#39;m (23:11 - 23:15)
getting to Korea a couple days before (23:13 - 23:17)
the event so I&#39;m going to try to go down (23:15 - 23:21)
there but if you want to look at these (23:17 - 23:24)
items uh and they&#39;re beautiful items MH (23:21 - 23:26)
they really (23:24 - 23:29)
are yeah I can&#39;t I can&#39;t tell if that go (23:26 - 23:33)
is ceramic or plastic right yeah I was (23:29 - 23:35)
going to say either way I think it&#39;s (23:33 - 23:38)
neat it looks the reflections on it and (23:35 - 23:41)
kind of the rim looks like ceramic mhm (23:38 - 23:44)
yes (23:41 - 23:46)
yeah the notebook looks awesome (23:44 - 23:48)
everything looks great uh but if you (23:46 - 23:49)
want to see what these items look like (23:48 - 23:51)
we&#39;ll put it in the we&#39;ll put in the (23:49 - 23:54)
show notes um is there a reason that (23:51 - 23:57)
they are doing the Safari Zone and like (23:54 - 23:59)
maybe and adding in this pop-up store at (23:57 - 24:01)
this time isn&#39;t there like is there a (23:59 - 24:02)
holiday or something or like some kind (24:01 - 24:05)
of it&#39;s like Korean I think it&#39;s Korean (24:02 - 24:08)
Thanksgiving okay I don&#39;t know when I (24:05 - 24:10)
when I say Thanksgiving I don&#39;t know (24:08 - 24:11)
what that entails compared to an (24:10 - 24:15)
American Thanksgiving but it&#39;s it&#39;s why (24:11 - 24:17)
flights go up in price around this (24:15 - 24:23)
time and this is the technically the (24:17 - 24:27)
third Pokemon well I think Korea&#39;s had (24:23 - 24:29)
four Pokémon go events cuz they had they (24:27 - 24:33)
had goang which I went to um then they (24:29 - 24:34)
last year they had (24:33 - 24:36)
Soul uh which I also went to and then (24:34 - 24:39)
this year&#39;s inchon and then I think it (24:36 - 24:41)
was La it was last year and it was like (24:39 - 24:43)
a week before the World Championships (24:41 - 24:45)
they had the Korean event on jju which (24:43 - 24:48)
is like an island a little south of (24:45 - 24:50)
Korea okay (24:48 - 24:54)
um and they had like exclusive Pikachus (24:50 - 24:56)
that you could only get on Juju Island (24:54 - 25:00)
and they kind of did up that Island (24:56 - 25:00)
so Niantic does like Kore like there is (25:00 - 25:04)
a (25:03 - 25:07)
big Korea loves Pokemon like there&#39;s no (25:04 - 25:10)
doubt here like it&#39;s like there are no (25:07 - 25:13)
Pokemon centers in Korea which is really (25:10 - 25:15)
weird because there is one in Taiwan (25:13 - 25:16)
there is one in Singapore those are the (25:15 - 25:19)
two non-japanese Pokemon centers that (25:16 - 25:20)
exist the one in Singapore is in the (25:19 - 25:22)
airport so if you ever have a layover in (25:20 - 25:24)
Singapore there is a Pokemon Center (25:22 - 25:26)
there uh the one in Taiwan opened almost (25:24 - 25:29)
a year ago in December (25:26 - 25:33)
um i i e easy prediction for anyone I (25:29 - 25:34)
would imagine that there will be a (25:33 - 25:37)
Pokemon Center somewhere in South Korea (25:34 - 25:39)
probably in the next like three or four (25:37 - 25:42)
years easy there&#39;s like no way yeah that (25:39 - 25:46)
would South Korea um they they still (25:42 - 25:48)
have Toys R Us in South Korea which is (25:46 - 25:51)
kind of funny so in Soul there&#39;s a huge (25:48 - 25:56)
Toys R Us and in the Toys R Us uh is (25:51 - 25:59)
what is called a Pokemon Zone so it&#39;s (25:56 - 26:02)
kind of like a mini Pokemon Center um (25:59 - 26:04)
that&#39;s cool I actually streamed it last (26:02 - 26:07)
year but like it&#39;s a ton of like a ton (26:04 - 26:11)
of Pokemon stuff inside a Toys R Us (26:07 - 26:14)
inside a huge Mall in the center of Soul (26:11 - 26:17)
uh it&#39;s they had like pretty much every (26:14 - 26:21)
set of cards like that was when um 151 (26:17 - 26:23)
got released so I have a bunch of (26:21 - 26:27)
unopened Korean 151 they had every set (26:23 - 26:30)
before that uh has their own Pokemon (26:27 - 26:31)
exclusive merchandise that you can&#39;t (26:30 - 26:33)
really get anywhere else (26:31 - 26:37)
so I think I think there&#39;s (26:33 - 26:37)
like like it&#39;s one of the ways like (26:37 - 26:41)
Japan and Korea are like trying to (26:40 - 26:43)
repair their relationship because (26:41 - 26:44)
there&#39;s like a lot of bad history there (26:43 - 26:47)
but like (26:44 - 26:50)
uh I do feel like the Pokemon company (26:47 - 26:52)
gives Pokemon Korea a lot (26:50 - 26:58)
of attention like good yeah I I feel (26:52 - 27:01)
like in the TCG as well Korean Pokemon (26:58 - 27:04)
cards are it&#39;s like you have Japanese (27:01 - 27:05)
Pokemon cards you have like (27:04 - 27:07)
International Pokemon cards I feel like (27:05 - 27:09)
Korean Pokemon cards they get like (27:07 - 27:11)
special sets sometimes for like special (27:09 - 27:13)
stuff as well that&#39;s a little bit (27:11 - 27:16)
different um it&#39;s almost almost like (27:13 - 27:18)
treated in a way that&#39;s a little bit (27:16 - 27:21)
more um I want say special but it&#39;s like (27:18 - 27:22)
different than like the international (27:21 - 27:24)
stuff as well they get like extra stuff (27:22 - 27:27)
with Korean cards sometimes yeah and (27:24 - 27:30)
we&#39;ve we&#39;ve talked about this before of (27:27 - 27:31)
switching Switching gears over to like (27:30 - 27:34)
Niantic and Pokémon (27:31 - 27:37)
go if your country or your city if we&#39;re (27:34 - 27:39)
talking about the United States really (27:37 - 27:43)
wants tourism then you have to bid for (27:39 - 27:45)
those events right you have to bid for (27:43 - 27:48)
F1 to come to Vegas you have to bid for (27:45 - 27:50)
I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been told that (27:48 - 27:53)
Anaheim desperately wants San Diego&#39;s (27:50 - 27:56)
Comic-Con and they they keep trying to (27:53 - 27:58)
bid to get San Diego&#39;s Comic-Con to move (27:56 - 28:01)
to an time yeah and eventually you offer (27:58 - 28:03)
enough money where you make that happen (28:01 - 28:07)
so I do think there is a lot of like we (28:03 - 28:10)
know Pokemon brings people to our (28:07 - 28:13)
country to boost tourism to promote (28:10 - 28:15)
tourism so I think I think Korea just (28:13 - 28:17)
keeps bidding and Niantic is good with (28:15 - 28:21)
the money Korea is (28:17 - 28:21)
paying um so yeah we&#39;ll see that&#39;s why I (28:22 - 28:29)
that&#39;s why I think like (28:26 - 28:30)
next year&#39;s go Fest is probably going to (28:29 - 28:32)
be New York I I do think that they (28:30 - 28:35)
signed a multi-year deal to bring that (28:32 - 28:38)
tourism to Randall&#39;s Island and stuff (28:35 - 28:42)
like that but yeah that&#39;s (28:38 - 28:46)
understandable um but yeah uh I (28:42 - 28:48)
will I&#39;m going to take a 90-minute trick (28:46 - 28:50)
out to this mall and hope that things (28:48 - 28:52)
aren&#39;t completely sold out and it&#39;s not (28:50 - 28:55)
a nightmare and yeah maybe you will get (28:52 - 28:57)
to experience the people climbing over (28:55 - 28:59)
each other for these special exclusive (28:57 - 29:02)
Pokemon Goods hopefully (28:59 - 29:05)
yeah I yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what (29:02 - 29:09)
that looks like um but uh all right (29:05 - 29:11)

Jakarta so trying to get are you guys (30:49 - 30:54)

Jakarta you&#39;re very close to Jakarta I (30:59 - 31:04)
am not it&#39;s the closest one for me but (31:01 - 31:06)
it&#39;s still like a seven and a bit hour (31:04 - 31:08)
flight but yes it&#39;s (31:06 - 31:12)
close CL as in seven hours (31:08 - 31:15)
yeah um so yeah I&#39;m trying to get as (31:12 - 31:17)
much as many things done as possible (31:15 - 31:20)
before Jakarta because that&#39;s a very far (31:17 - 31:23)
for me yes yes yeah true Minnesota to (31:20 - 31:24)
that&#39;s probably one of your longer ones (31:23 - 31:28)
right it&#39;s the longest I&#39;ve ever so wow (31:24 - 31:30)
13 hours to Japan and then I&#39;m in Japan (31:28 - 31:34)
for a night um and (31:30 - 31:37)
then to break it up yeah yeah and then (31:34 - 31:39)
another I think eight hours from Japan (31:37 - 31:40)
to (31:39 - 31:42)
Jakarta you can do it if you got the you (31:40 - 31:44)
got the break in between the Happy Days (31:42 - 31:46)
like I think I think the break is going (31:44 - 31:49)
to make it much easier to a (31:46 - 31:49)
th% I&#39;m very okay with just getting one (31:50 - 31:54)
night to start giving you like all the (31:52 - 31:56)
tips of like what to do and then you&#39;re (31:54 - 31:57)
like I stay for a night I&#39;m like oh okay (31:56 - 31:59)
he&#39;s fine he&#39;s fine (31:57 - 32:01)
perfect um yeah it&#39;s a long enough (31:59 - 32:04)
layover where it&#39;s like hotel is okay (32:01 - 32:08)
yeah yeah that&#39;s good um okay so uh (32:04 - 32:11)
we&#39;ve had we&#39;re here because Pokemon Go (32:08 - 32:13)
released a very big feature I think it&#39;s (32:11 - 32:16)
very big uh I agree Niantic talked about (32:13 - 32:18)
how it was very big and they&#39;ve spent (32:16 - 32:19)
however long working on it and they&#39;re (32:18 - 32:22)
very proud of it um which take that for (32:19 - 32:24)
what it&#39;s worth I think I think there (32:22 - 32:26)
are things that nitic should be proud of (32:24 - 32:28)
um but they definitely said they&#39;re very (32:26 - 32:30)
proud of this so I wanted to talk to you (32:28 - 32:33)
about this new feature cuz I think after (32:30 - 32:35)
the first week of actually doing it not (32:33 - 32:38)
the like prame week they (32:35 - 32:42)
did the warm up yeah the warm-up week uh (32:38 - 32:45)
I actually think it does lay a (32:42 - 32:48)
foundation to the future of Pokemon go (32:45 - 32:52)
um as a as like a feature yeah I I I&#39;d (32:48 - 32:56)
agree with that like I feel I feel like (32:52 - 32:58)
it was it was kind of funny in a way (32:56 - 33:02)
where it&#39;s like I seeing all the people (32:58 - 33:03)
commenting online like before the (33:02 - 33:05)
feature was even out giving a judgment (33:03 - 33:07)
and I&#39;m like it&#39;s not even out yet like (33:05 - 33:09)
sort of thing like oh this is this is (33:07 - 33:10)
feature is going to suck and blah blah (33:09 - 33:11)
blah blah I&#39;m like we don&#39;t even know (33:10 - 33:14)
the game play like Lop yet my guy like I (33:11 - 33:16)
don&#39;t even know yet like let&#39;s just wait (33:14 - 33:20)
and see um but yeah it&#39;s kind of like (33:16 - 33:22)
it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting I&#39;m very curious (33:20 - 33:23)
like for the (33:22 - 33:27)
long-term goal of it in a way um because (33:23 - 33:29)
I guess it is in and that you can only (33:27 - 33:32)
use your Dynamax stuff to do Dynamax (33:29 - 33:35)
stuff uh it&#39;s kind of a new Grind (33:32 - 33:37)
potentially if you want new things to (33:35 - 33:39)
work towards EMP power up it feeds into (33:37 - 33:42)
the daily Loop gameplay pretty well as (33:39 - 33:45)
well um (33:42 - 33:48)
yeah it&#39;s I I don&#39;t hate it like I don&#39;t (33:45 - 33:51)
I don&#39;t dislike it I&#39;m just curious to (33:48 - 33:54)
see where it goes for sure raging review (33:51 - 33:56)
I don&#39;t hate it yeah I don&#39;t hate Zoe (33:54 - 33:58)
doesn&#39;t hate I don&#39;t hate a lot of (33:56 - 33:59)
things honestly I think you have to like (33:58 - 34:02)
really try which you know sometimes they (33:59 - 34:06)
they sure do but um I yeah I feel like (34:02 - 34:10)
it&#39;s still I don&#39;t know what do you have (34:06 - 34:11)
you have you guessing you probably like (34:10 - 34:13)
discussed like the functionality already (34:11 - 34:15)
on the podcast like people know how it (34:13 - 34:18)
works or uh no no we we we discuss I (34:15 - 34:20)
guess we would have been discussing the (34:18 - 34:22)
functionality this week uh because last (34:20 - 34:24)
last week was still the pregame week uh (34:22 - 34:27)
and I think I think all of us last week (34:24 - 34:30)
were really excited for the potential uh (34:27 - 34:31)
but we we had the questions of like how (34:30 - 34:33)
much does it cost how many raids can we (34:31 - 34:35)
do what&#39;s the what&#39;s the actual flow of (34:33 - 34:39)
it um but I was excited in itself of (34:35 - 34:43)
just seeing after eight years a new POI (34:39 - 34:44)
on the map and (34:43 - 34:48)
yes yes 1,000% like there&#39;s been so many (34:44 - 34:50)
like especially early days when we (34:48 - 34:52)
didn&#39;t fully know the whole like has to (34:50 - 34:55)
be in its own S2 cell and 20 M away from (34:52 - 34:57)
an existing POI and whatever I had like (34:55 - 35:00)
suggest a bunch of Poké stops that never (34:57 - 35:02)
got put in because they were like a (35:00 - 35:03)
meter too close to an existing one and (35:02 - 35:05)
it&#39;s like now they&#39;re actually in the (35:03 - 35:07)
game and functional as a as a raid Den (35:05 - 35:09)
sort of thing I&#39;m like Oh yay at least (35:07 - 35:13)
my my hard efforts didn&#39;t go to waste um (35:09 - 35:15)
but also then like even if you didn&#39;t if (35:13 - 35:16)
you had never been someone who had (35:15 - 35:19)
submitted a POI um I&#39;ve definitely (35:16 - 35:21)
noticed like so many more of these I (35:19 - 35:24)
keep calling them dens the power spots I (35:21 - 35:25)
keep seeing so many more of the dens in (35:24 - 35:28)
like residential is areas because (35:25 - 35:30)
feeding from like Google businesses and (35:28 - 35:32)
stuff and people have you know (35:30 - 35:35)
businesses in regular residential areas (35:32 - 35:37)
that have never been a POI it&#39;s like (35:35 - 35:39)
giving something to do in like a (35:37 - 35:41)
suburban area where usually there was (35:39 - 35:44)
nothing which is kind of nice as well um (35:41 - 35:45)
that&#39;s refreshing for me at least where (35:44 - 35:47)
I&#39;m like oh I mean I guess I could go (35:45 - 35:49)
for a little walk and interact with that (35:47 - 35:51)
that never used to exist there that POI (35:49 - 35:54)
didn&#39;t exist in the game so yeah that&#39;s (35:51 - 35:56)
refreshing for me it was like uh I I was (35:54 - 35:58)
saying on the podcast that (35:56 - 36:00)
I don&#39;t like releasing starters or (35:58 - 36:03)
releasing two extra Pokemon like this (36:00 - 36:04)
drip feed that they started doing with (36:03 - 36:07)
like gen 3 Gen 4 gen five like it&#39;s just (36:04 - 36:09)
not enough to get me out of the house (36:07 - 36:12)
like I I can I can just pinap the groy I (36:09 - 36:14)
can just pinap the sore bunny there will (36:12 - 36:16)
eventually be a groi and score bunny (36:14 - 36:17)
Community Day so it&#39;s not like that big (36:16 - 36:20)
of a rush to like evolve them um and I&#39;m (36:17 - 36:22)
sure for some people they were like (36:20 - 36:24)
score Cinder is my favorite Pokemon I&#39;m (36:22 - 36:25)
going to go out there I&#39;m going to get (36:24 - 36:28)
as many score bunnies as possible I will (36:25 - 36:30)
do the same thing when karant gets added (36:28 - 36:31)
to the game I will go out and get as (36:30 - 36:34)
many as possible (36:31 - 36:36)
but for the first time in a long time (36:34 - 36:38)
with Pokemon go just seeing new points (36:36 - 36:40)
of interest on the map and just being (36:38 - 36:42)
like I don&#39;t know what that does yet I (36:40 - 36:43)
want to walk to it I want to spin it (36:42 - 36:45)
okay I collected something oh there&#39;s (36:43 - 36:46)
another one I want to walk to that I (36:45 - 36:49)
want to spin it yeah that in itself was (36:46 - 36:52)
just like so exciting and it did make me (36:49 - 36:54)
go down I&#39;ve lived in the same (36:52 - 36:56)
neighborhood for two years it made me go (36:54 - 36:58)
down streets I&#39;ve never gone down yeah (36:56 - 36:59)
oh I didn&#39;t know there was like a (36:58 - 37:00)
community garden over here I didn&#39;t know (36:59 - 37:03)
there was like a a workshop over here I (37:00 - 37:04)
didn&#39;t know there was like a tech store (37:03 - 37:07)
over here um and I think us that example (37:04 - 37:08)
so many times as well cuz like when the (37:07 - 37:10)
game first dropped like that community (37:08 - 37:11)
garden thing was my first thing that I (37:10 - 37:13)
could see on my nearby was like I didn&#39;t (37:11 - 37:16)
know we had a community garden like and (37:13 - 37:17)
it made me go and explore and check it (37:16 - 37:19)
out like when the game first dropped so (37:17 - 37:21)
I feel like it&#39;s very similar in that (37:19 - 37:24)
way of yeah hey you didn&#39;t know this was (37:21 - 37:26)
here go and check it out sort of thing (37:24 - 37:29)
it&#39;s it&#39;s very incentive vising to (37:26 - 37:33)
explore yeah and I think um I think uh (37:29 - 37:36)
we were both at the the soul uh Pokemon (37:33 - 37:39)
City Safari and the way they laid that (37:36 - 37:41)
out with like the flowers and the Poké (37:39 - 37:45)
stops was like exactly how a tourist (37:41 - 37:47)
should explore Soul like oh it&#39;s taking (37:45 - 37:49)
me to all the places that like these (37:47 - 37:51)
websites or these Tik toks would (37:49 - 37:53)
recommend like whoever laid that out (37:51 - 37:55)
just fantastic but I do think like (37:53 - 37:57)
here&#39;s a bunch of pois and now like you (37:55 - 37:59)
have reason to (37:57 - 38:01)
explore maybe your same are I don&#39;t know (37:59 - 38:03)
maybe you live in like a city of a (38:01 - 38:04)
thousand people and you&#39;re like I&#39;ve (38:03 - 38:05)
definitely been (38:04 - 38:07)
everywhere I mean there&#39;s definitely (38:05 - 38:09)
businesses I didn&#39;t know about for sure (38:07 - 38:10)
cuz like again again because like the (38:09 - 38:12)
data is half I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s half (38:10 - 38:14)
half or what the qualifies actually are (38:12 - 38:16)
but it seems to be feeding from Google (38:14 - 38:20)
Business info plus uh pois that are just (38:16 - 38:24)
slightly too close to existing ones um (38:20 - 38:26)
I&#39;m I&#39;m assuming if there&#39;s no business (38:24 - 38:28)
data they just flipped and Ed the pii (38:26 - 38:29)
one maybe it&#39;s just random I have no (38:28 - 38:32)
clue um but yeah there&#39;s definitely (38:29 - 38:34)
still surprising ones for me where I&#39;m (38:32 - 38:40)
like oh like I I Newcastle is like big (38:34 - 38:42)
but it&#39;s very spread out so it&#39;s like (38:40 - 38:45)
where I am um is like one of the quieter (38:42 - 38:48)
bits so I yeah I&#39;ve seen most of my town (38:45 - 38:52)
but like there&#39;s still definitely um (38:48 - 38:54)
plenty that I haven&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t have (38:52 - 38:57)
known about sort of thing um yeah it&#39;s (38:54 - 39:01)
still it&#39;s still definit definitely gets (38:57 - 39:03)
me I&#39;m curious if it&#39;ll keep getting me (39:01 - 39:06)
out of the house but it&#39;s like it is (39:03 - 39:09)
more more points of incentive when (39:06 - 39:13)
there&#39;s more of it you know um like I (39:09 - 39:16)
even I said back in the day like when uh (39:13 - 39:18)
the the daily incense and that sort of (39:16 - 39:19)
thing came out I&#39;m like if you tell (39:18 - 39:22)
people that you can get a legendary on (39:19 - 39:23)
an incense people will go out and use it (39:22 - 39:26)
it&#39;s unfortunate that the birds are so (39:23 - 39:28)
rare half the time (39:26 - 39:30)
um that that is then counteractive and a (39:28 - 39:34)
bit demotivating I think but um you know (39:30 - 39:35)
I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s probably a (39:34 - 39:38)
nice balance point for all of that to (39:35 - 39:39)
get people out and exploring and playing (39:38 - 39:43)
the game for any feature yeah I I feel (39:39 - 39:46)
like with now that we&#39;ve done the raids (39:43 - 39:49)
the Dynamax raids um and I know you&#39;re (39:46 - 39:51)
not a huge raid person you&#39;re not you&#39;re (39:49 - 39:53)
not a player that&#39;s like I&#39;m doing 10 (39:51 - 39:55)
remote raids a day and now they nerfed (39:53 - 39:57)
it to five and now I&#39;m doing all five a (39:55 - 39:59)
day um and I&#39;m the same way like I when (39:57 - 40:03)
I&#39;m at an event uh I&#39;ll do raids or if (39:59 - 40:05)
it&#39;s a Wednesday night at six o&#39;clock (40:03 - 40:07)
yeah I&#39;ll do raids for sure because it (40:05 - 40:08)
gets like people together and it&#39;s much (40:07 - 40:11)
easier but I was never the I did it for (40:08 - 40:13)
one Pokemon which was Deoxys I sat there (40:11 - 40:16)
and I I hold the lever every time for to (40:13 - 40:19)
remote into Deo yeah of all the ones it (40:16 - 40:21)
was Deoxys but I was never I was never (40:19 - 40:24)
the remote raid like I&#39;m going to do as (40:21 - 40:27)
many as possible um but I do feel with (40:24 - 40:29)
like the Dynamax raids it almost feels (40:27 - 40:32)
like a a soft (40:29 - 40:36)
restart on the raid system and it&#39;s (40:32 - 40:39)
like it almost feels like to compare it (40:36 - 40:41)
like your current raid system that (40:39 - 40:43)
exists with the remote raid passes and (40:41 - 40:45)
everything that feels like World of (40:43 - 40:47)
Warcraft leg like the old World of (40:45 - 40:50)
Warcraft system and then this feels like (40:47 - 40:52)
a newer it&#39;s like the rebooted the the (40:50 - 40:55)
refresh the 2.0 sort of thing right cuz (40:52 - 40:58)
you&#39;re ultimately starting over you have (40:55 - 40:59)
to first do your mission and get your (40:58 - 41:02)
wulu and then once cuz I I actually (40:59 - 41:03)
played with people in New York over the (41:02 - 41:05)
weekend and I was like oh there&#39;s four (41:03 - 41:06)
of us this is perfect let&#39;s do this (41:05 - 41:09)
Squirtle and then two of them didn&#39;t (41:06 - 41:10)
ever do their mission to get their wulu (41:09 - 41:12)
and it was just blocked they couldn&#39;t (41:10 - 41:15)
join ah yeah okay and it was like okay (41:12 - 41:16)
you have to do the intro Mission you got (41:15 - 41:18)
to get the wulu then you can participate (41:16 - 41:22)
with us but it is like Niantic and we (41:18 - 41:25)
said you have to kind of start over your (41:22 - 41:28)
Kyogre is or your zer your Asians cannot (41:25 - 41:32)
go into these raids yeah it&#39;s kind of (41:28 - 41:34)
like a cool like blank slate in a way (41:32 - 41:36)
where it&#39;s it no one can kind of get (41:34 - 41:39)
left behind um if you&#39;re starting you (41:36 - 41:41)
know starting fresh it&#39;s starting easy (41:39 - 41:43)
it&#39;s just the start of Pokemon like (41:41 - 41:44)
they&#39;re not too difficult yes you can (41:43 - 41:47)
solo them but it&#39;s (41:44 - 41:50)
it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s going to be another I (41:47 - 41:52)
guess a new Grind a new like kicking off (41:50 - 41:55)
point to to build a new set of Pokémon (41:52 - 41:57)
in a way um yeah cuz you know you can (41:55 - 41:58)
still use use your Kyogre and whatever (41:57 - 42:01)
else for regular raids for for gyms (41:58 - 42:03)
whatever else (42:01 - 42:09)
um yeah I&#39;m just I&#39;m I&#39;m so curious what (42:03 - 42:11)
the (42:09 - 42:15)
like I I feel like it&#39;s going to be (42:11 - 42:18)
self-contained for a long long time and (42:15 - 42:20)
I feel like myself included it&#39;s like I (42:18 - 42:23)
kind of wish I could damax you know one (42:20 - 42:25)
of my existing Pokémon but then that (42:23 - 42:27)
would defeat the purpose of the new (42:25 - 42:29)
system in a way if you could just do it (42:27 - 42:33)
to the ones you already have right um (42:29 - 42:36)
like maybe in in years down the road I (42:33 - 42:40)
can get some Max soup for my for my uh (42:36 - 42:43)
my Pokemon but yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it is (42:40 - 42:45)
refreshing though like I I haven&#39;t had a (42:43 - 42:48)
chance to to do um the Dynamax battles (42:45 - 42:51)
with like a a large group of people yet (42:48 - 42:53)
um to see have you have you been able to (42:51 - 42:54)
do I guess you said on the weekend you (42:53 - 42:58)
have work with people um yeah (42:54 - 43:00)
doing battles yeah yeah I was only able (42:58 - 43:01)
to do it with one other person but none (43:00 - 43:04)
of the raids I I have been difficult (43:01 - 43:05)
enough (43:04 - 43:08)
to like I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve never gotten to (43:05 - 43:09)
like the second or third Pokemon in my (43:08 - 43:12)
party yeah yeah yeah I&#39;m kind of curious (43:09 - 43:14)
like I was like I this like the social (43:12 - 43:16)
aspect like if it is getting people out (43:14 - 43:18)
in groups again or if it&#39;s more because (43:16 - 43:21)
it&#39;s a bit more passive and it&#39;s not as (43:18 - 43:24)
difficult yet that until we see (43:21 - 43:26)
something like gigantamax Lapras bring (43:24 - 43:29)
all your bulbasaurus everyone like hope (43:26 - 43:31)
you powered them up like until we see (43:29 - 43:33)
something more challenging maybe it will (43:31 - 43:37)
just be a bit um not not Solo solo but a (43:33 - 43:40)
bit more lowkey until that (43:37 - 43:43)
point um yeah um I think like speaking (43:40 - 43:46)
of solo I think the leaving a Pokemon (43:43 - 43:50)
behind to help other people is really (43:46 - 43:54)
clever and I think that helps solve the (43:50 - 43:56)
I live in the middle of nowhere and (43:54 - 43:58)
there might be other Pokemon players but (43:56 - 44:00)
I haven&#39;t seen them but you would see (43:58 - 44:01)
them well you would see them I guess if (44:00 - 44:05)
they&#39;re taking your gym but but like at (44:01 - 44:06)
least the cordinating together to be (44:05 - 44:08)
like I don&#39;t know how to get these (44:06 - 44:11)
people here yeah um at least then you (44:08 - 44:13)
know there are people like especially if (44:11 - 44:15)
you&#39;re like if you didn&#39;t know or people (44:13 - 44:17)
don&#39;t bother with gyms in your area and (44:15 - 44:19)
suddenly you&#39;re like hey there&#39;s five (44:17 - 44:22)
people that have left a Wu in this you (44:19 - 44:23)
know this (44:22 - 44:26)
Den all right maybe we uh you know try (44:23 - 44:28)
and try (44:26 - 44:31)
and find them and then you can do do (44:28 - 44:32)
raids together and do like you know have (44:31 - 44:33)
a community sort of thing have a (44:32 - 44:36)
community day with people that you (44:33 - 44:38)
didn&#39;t even know you know lived around (44:36 - 44:40)
the corner from you sort of thing yeah (44:38 - 44:44)
yeah like um I went to Mall of (44:40 - 44:47)
America uh for Ponyta Community Day and (44:44 - 44:49)
that was the first time I&#39;ve gone to (44:47 - 44:52)
Mall of America since the new points of (44:49 - 44:56)
interest were added and it (44:52 - 44:59)
was there was was like seven Max I&#39;m (44:56 - 45:01)
going to say raid dens cuz like they&#39;re (44:59 - 45:03)
raid dens power (45:01 - 45:07)
spots and it was crazy to see how like (45:03 - 45:09)
almost all of them would have one person (45:07 - 45:10)
and then they disappear and then all of (45:09 - 45:12)
a sudden one person they would disappear (45:10 - 45:13)
like people were just going in and doing (45:12 - 45:17)
them constantly um and obviously these (45:13 - 45:19)
raids currently are easy enough to do it (45:17 - 45:22)
but it was cool to see like oh we&#39;re (45:19 - 45:25)
like sneaking raids in between Pony to (45:22 - 45:27)
community and we&#39;re still doing the the (45:25 - 45:30)
legendary raid or whatever the three (45:27 - 45:32)
star raids that were there um yeah so it (45:30 - 45:34)
felt really natural but at the same (45:32 - 45:37)
time it was like oh I can just ignore (45:34 - 45:39)
this I can just do community (45:37 - 45:44)
day I&#39;m not worried about Dynamax so I I (45:39 - 45:45)
I am a fan of video games that will (45:44 - 45:49)
introduce new features but then not (45:45 - 45:51)
force you to do (45:49 - 45:54)
them yeah yeah it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not (45:51 - 45:56)
going to be Game ending if you don&#39;t (45:54 - 45:59)
participate (45:56 - 46:01)
I for now at least I guess for yeah for (45:59 - 46:05)
now yes I so I suppose if you wanted (46:01 - 46:07)
like gigantamax Lapras or gigantamax (46:05 - 46:09)
Venusaur you would have to start (46:07 - 46:11)
participating or probably what everyone (46:09 - 46:14)
assumes like eternus no but remember in (46:11 - 46:16)
that in that bit of the there was that (46:14 - 46:18)
promotional video that said uh if all (46:16 - 46:20)
your Pokemon faint you can just cheer (46:18 - 46:21)
for your friends so you can still just (46:20 - 46:23)
be a filthy casual and get your three (46:21 - 46:25)
other friends to carry you hopefully you (46:23 - 46:29)
know hopefully three is enough (46:25 - 46:32)
to take on you know whatever big baddies (46:29 - 46:34)
they bring out at some (46:32 - 46:38)
point yeah I I like the fact (46:34 - 46:42)
that you can do multiple of these raids (46:38 - 46:45)
for free so our current yeah our current (46:42 - 46:47)
structure with raids is you get one free (46:45 - 46:51)
raid pass and for me I would try to save (46:47 - 46:54)
that free raid pass for a five-star raid (46:51 - 46:55)
yeah because that&#39;s a more rare Pokemon (46:54 - 46:57)
you get better rewards you get more (46:55 - 46:59)
experience all that stuff so I always (46:57 - 47:02)
felt like a disconnect between like why (46:59 - 47:05)
would I spend a dollar on a onear raid (47:02 - 47:07)
when I could spend a dollar on a fstar (47:05 - 47:10)
raid and get significantly more rewards (47:07 - 47:12)
and I feel the same about remote raids (47:10 - 47:14)
I&#39;m never going to remote raid into a (47:12 - 47:18)
one star Pikachu I I and I unless it was (47:14 - 47:20)
something where it&#39;s like an event (47:18 - 47:21)
exclusive and I can&#39;t be there and I&#39;m (47:20 - 47:23)
like okay I&#39;ll get the one that&#39;s from (47:21 - 47:26)
that loc maybe but I&#39;m like I I I refuse (47:23 - 47:28)
to even a remote if in my own country (47:26 - 47:30)
I&#39;m like that&#39;s still too close for me I (47:28 - 47:32)
can&#39;t like you know it&#39;s like I I feel (47:30 - 47:35)
like it has to be yeah a decent raid (47:32 - 47:37)
like overseas so I get the trade (47:35 - 47:40)
distance as well like all of these (47:37 - 47:41)
factors to make a remote raid worth it (47:40 - 47:44)
for me where I&#39;m like I&#39;m not I&#39;m (47:41 - 47:47)
probably not going to remote raid like a (47:44 - 47:49)
yeah a one star something that&#39;s down (47:47 - 47:51)
the road I&#39;m like no thank you thanks (47:49 - 47:52)
for (47:51 - 47:55)
no yeah I I agree though it&#39;s like (47:52 - 47:57)
because you can just do multiple of (47:55 - 47:58)
these in a day and then plus if you&#39;ve (47:57 - 48:00)
stashed all of your your I keep calling (47:58 - 48:03)
them Orbeez if you stashed your I like (48:00 - 48:05)
Orbeez stashing the Orbeez yeah if (48:03 - 48:07)
you&#39;ve tested your Orbeez from the day (48:05 - 48:09)
before you could oh from the week you (48:07 - 48:12)
know if you&#39;ve had you got the 4,000 you (48:09 - 48:15)
could go out smash out a b bunch of (48:12 - 48:18)
these um max battles and then keep (48:15 - 48:20)
earning your MP through the day and go (48:18 - 48:22)
do some more if you wanted to like it&#39;s (48:20 - 48:25)
it&#39;s almost like a self-governing raid (48:22 - 48:28)
train in a way like back back in my day (48:25 - 48:30)
back in the day like for raid weekends (48:28 - 48:32)
and stuff we would genuinely like get (48:30 - 48:33)
the squad together get everyone in like (48:32 - 48:35)
two sets of cars and like go around and (48:33 - 48:38)
do um big raid days because you knew (48:35 - 48:40)
that every gym was going to have you (48:38 - 48:41)
know raids popping every hour or (48:40 - 48:45)
whatever else um so kind of it kind of (48:41 - 48:46)
feels reminiscent of that where it&#39;s (48:45 - 48:48)
like hey go and do a bunch plus it&#39;s (48:46 - 48:51)
free like hell yeah I&#39;ll do that yeah no (48:48 - 48:53)
it (48:51 - 48:55)
feels I was worried with the like the (48:53 - 48:58)
the pregaming week that oh I guess I (48:55 - 49:00)
guess my one complaint and I think I saw (48:58 - 49:02)
this complaint a lot I&#39;m curious what (49:00 - 49:04)
your thought is is like the limit of a (49:02 - 49:09)
thousand it feels a little tight yeah I (49:04 - 49:11)
feel like it&#39;s it&#39;s just a little it&#39;s (49:09 - 49:14)
just a little bit like a little bit too (49:11 - 49:18)
little like in in my mind I can kind of (49:14 - 49:20)
see it where it&#39;s like well because it&#39;s (49:18 - 49:22)
little you have to do something with it (49:20 - 49:24)
where it&#39;s kind of like if you want to (49:22 - 49:26)
go out and do a bunch of them tomorrow (49:24 - 49:28)
but you can&#39;t pick up up more I think (49:26 - 49:29)
it&#39;s that frustration of like when you (49:28 - 49:30)
have something there to claim but you (49:29 - 49:33)
can&#39;t like that&#39;s really annoying um or (49:30 - 49:34)
if you&#39;re at a stop and it&#39;s like you (49:33 - 49:37)
can&#39;t claim it like that sort of (49:34 - 49:40)
rejection like is really irritating it&#39;s (49:37 - 49:41)
like you can&#39;t clear a notification or (49:40 - 49:43)
something it&#39;s like I think it&#39;s just (49:41 - 49:45)
bothersome but I&#39;m I&#39;ve been trying to (49:43 - 49:46)
look at it in a way where I&#39;m like why (49:45 - 49:48)
would you make it that limit and it&#39;s (49:46 - 49:50)
kind of like well if that limit then (49:48 - 49:53)
forces you to actually use the resource (49:50 - 49:56)
like give your best one a better move or (49:53 - 49:59)
unlock another move or power up the move (49:56 - 50:01)
or whatever else like you&#39;re probably (49:59 - 50:02)
actually going to have to do it like (50:01 - 50:05)
I&#39;ve actually used some MP to I got (50:02 - 50:06)
lucky lucky traded one with Allan and it (50:05 - 50:08)
went like 98 and I was like hell yeah (50:06 - 50:10)
it&#39;s a good Blastoise anyway it&#39;s 98 (50:08 - 50:12)
it&#39;s going to be probably my best (50:10 - 50:14)
Dynamax Pokemon for the next 100 years (50:12 - 50:16)
um because I&#39;m so unlucky with these (50:14 - 50:18)
things uh sure I&#39;ll give it the extra (50:16 - 50:21)
move I&#39;ll power it up a bit because I (50:18 - 50:24)
can&#39;t collect any more today and I have (50:21 - 50:26)
stuff that I can still collect before (50:24 - 50:28)
I&#39;m capped so it&#39;s made me use it I&#39;ve (50:26 - 50:32)
still never spent a single XL rare candy (50:28 - 50:33)
just have 200 of them sitting there cuz (50:32 - 50:35)
I don&#39;t know what I want to do with it I (50:33 - 50:38)
have no there&#39;s nothing forcing me to do (50:35 - 50:41)
it there&#39;s no part of like well I can do (50:38 - 50:43)
raids with friends and it&#39;s not if only (50:41 - 50:47)
I had that maxed out insert Pokemon here (50:43 - 50:50)
or you know it&#39;s just sitting there (50:47 - 50:51)
until I decide what to do with it I (50:50 - 50:54)
guess whereas the MP sort of situation (50:51 - 50:57)
it&#39;s like you need to do something with (50:54 - 51:00)
it otherwise you can&#39;t get more in a way (50:57 - 51:02)
um that&#39;s the only way that I can think (51:00 - 51:04)
of it being so limiting is that it&#39;s (51:02 - 51:05)
going to make (51:04 - 51:10)
you use it I guess um yeah yeah yeah I I (51:05 - 51:13)
I think once the pregame week was over (51:10 - 51:16)
and you could spend it on raids or more (51:13 - 51:18)
raids or powering up it was like okay (51:16 - 51:21)
cool I can I can do like four raids and (51:18 - 51:22)
then I can spin eight stops and now I&#39;m (51:21 - 51:23)
refreshed and I can do that same thing (51:22 - 51:27)
tomorrow yeah um I think like (51:23 - 51:29)
I don&#39;t mind the I think it&#39;s you can do (51:27 - 51:32)
eight stops before it starts it&#39;s weird (51:29 - 51:34)
because there&#39;s like multiple limits and (51:32 - 51:35)
I think that&#39;s the frustrating so you (51:34 - 51:36)
have the a th000 limit and then you have (51:35 - 51:39)
the spin eight limit so it&#39;s like it&#39;s (51:36 - 51:44)
it&#39;s a th000 limit but then 800 per day (51:39 - 51:47)
cap but technically you can get more (51:44 - 51:50)
than 800 per day if you like interact (51:47 - 51:53)
with X number of the of the dens and (51:50 - 51:55)
then claim your walking bonus on top of (51:53 - 51:57)
so basically I get get up to 00 and (51:55 - 52:00)
something then claim you&#39;re walking (51:57 - 52:01)
which is 300 and that&#39;ll push you (52:00 - 52:03)
straight to the thousand in a day yeah (52:01 - 52:05)
but say if you had already spun the (52:03 - 52:08)
eight stops and then tried to claim (52:05 - 52:10)
you&#39;re walking it&#39;s like no sorry so (52:08 - 52:12)
then you have the 800 so it&#39;s kind of (52:10 - 52:14)
like because there&#39;s all these different (52:12 - 52:16)
technicalities it&#39;s I think still a bit (52:14 - 52:19)
confusing um and yeah the two different (52:16 - 52:22)
limits are a bit weird (52:19 - 52:25)
yeah yeah so I I I feel like one of (52:22 - 52:27)
those limits needs to be like slightly (52:25 - 52:31)
looser or at least let my walking yes (52:27 - 52:33)
push it over no matter what cuz I think (52:31 - 52:34)
the walking one is really clever like if (52:33 - 52:36)
you don&#39;t have a lot of pois in your (52:34 - 52:39)
area you just go for your adventure (52:36 - 52:41)
incense yep do your adventure incense (52:39 - 52:44)
get your 300 from walking and that&#39;s (52:41 - 52:47)
like I don&#39;t know I I I&#39;m just I&#39;m (52:44 - 52:48)
thinking of like everyone complaining (52:47 - 52:51)
about this feature before it rolling out (52:48 - 52:55)
and then me being like am Am I Wrong Am (52:51 - 52:57)
I the one wrong (52:55 - 52:58)
cuz I feel like everything they thought (52:57 - 53:03)
of is actually kind of decent in actual (52:58 - 53:05)
like like the battles came out that made (53:03 - 53:08)
it a lot less cuz it&#39;s very easy then to (53:05 - 53:11)
just spend 250 of the MP and it&#39;s like (53:08 - 53:13)
cool problem solved like you&#39;re spending (53:11 - 53:14)
a large chunk of it to actually (53:13 - 53:16)
participate in the in the battles I (53:14 - 53:19)
think that I don&#39;t know I feel like that (53:16 - 53:20)
alleviated some of the frustration (53:19 - 53:23)
hopefully mhm um I agree with you I (53:20 - 53:25)
think if you had like at least that one (53:23 - 53:27)
walking you could just claim to push (53:25 - 53:28)
over because then you&#39;d be working (53:27 - 53:30)
towards the next one for tomorrow sort (53:28 - 53:34)
of thing um that sort of incentive there (53:30 - 53:36)
but I (53:34 - 53:38)
I I I&#39;m curious how it&#39;s going to work (53:36 - 53:41)
once it gets to like the bigger like the (53:38 - 53:44)
higher level battles um because then (53:41 - 53:46)
it&#39;s like well how much do we need like (53:44 - 53:48)
what the Beldum ones are going to be (53:46 - 53:50)
tier three right three star yes which I (53:48 - 53:54)
think is like what 500 points instead of (53:50 - 53:58)
250 yeah or 400 four 400 or something (53:54 - 54:00)
yeah not can&#39;t remember 100% but um it&#39;s (53:58 - 54:02)
more but I&#39;m curious how that&#39;s thing (54:00 - 54:04)
going to factor and if it&#39;s going to be (54:02 - 54:06)
like okay now the 1,000 is frustrating (54:04 - 54:08)
because now I really don&#39;t have enough (54:06 - 54:13)
to participate plus you know spend on (54:08 - 54:18)
powering up or whatever else yeah so as (54:13 - 54:20)
a as a person (54:18 - 54:25)
who is not huge on raids um because (54:20 - 54:27)
these raids are pretty (54:25 - 54:29)
different are you leaning into these (54:27 - 54:31)
more of like oh these (54:29 - 54:33)
are because they&#39;re different because (54:31 - 54:35)
they have this Loop I&#39;m more interested (54:33 - 54:36)
in doing (54:35 - 54:39)
them um not I guess because they&#39;re new (54:36 - 54:42)
yes but (54:39 - 54:47)
like ye yes but I I can&#39;t quite put my (54:42 - 54:49)
finger on why I guess I don&#39;t know if (54:47 - 54:52)
it&#39;s just because of habit or like it&#39;s (54:49 - 54:58)
ingrained to to do it I I think it&#39;s (54:52 - 55:00)
cuz like if I had a onear raid down the (54:58 - 55:02)
road right now in the exact same spot as (55:00 - 55:05)
a as a as a power spot I probably (55:02 - 55:07)
wouldn&#39;t be motivated to go walk down (55:05 - 55:10)
and do it but for the power spot thing (55:07 - 55:13)
I&#39;m like oh you know I keep getting (55:10 - 55:14)
atrocious Charmander so far like if I (55:13 - 55:17)
see a Charmander like maybe I would (55:14 - 55:20)
because in my mind it&#39;s like well I&#39;m (55:17 - 55:22)
probably going to need this in the (55:20 - 55:24)
future to have a decent one sort of (55:22 - 55:26)
things I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just because (55:24 - 55:28)
it&#39;s something that I I think that I (55:26 - 55:30)
need (55:28 - 55:33)
um I don&#39;t know I I guess cuz there (55:30 - 55:34)
there&#39;s a lot more of them and they can (55:33 - 55:37)
be a lot closer like again like from me (55:34 - 55:40)
walking to the shops or something like I (55:37 - 55:43)
could do three or four of these things (55:40 - 55:45)
not just like my one free raid pass I (55:43 - 55:47)
guess so in that way it&#39;s like maybe (55:45 - 55:50)
more more value for your time um you can (55:47 - 55:55)
do quite a few of them but um do do you (55:50 - 55:58)
feel like almost starting over I mean I (55:55 - 55:59)
guess it is starting over do you feel (55:58 - 56:01)
like that&#39;s a negative I mean you did (55:59 - 56:04)
mention that like I wish I could Dynamax (56:01 - 56:06)
something I already had yeah I think (56:04 - 56:08)
there&#39;s just that fomo of like I would (56:06 - 56:11)
love to see you know one of my existing (56:08 - 56:12)
Pokemon like oh look at it like it&#39;s a (56:11 - 56:14)
gigant like yeah cool that&#39;s my guy that (56:12 - 56:16)
I caught back here like that&#39;s more the (56:14 - 56:19)
sentimentality of it but um in terms of (56:16 - 56:21)
like functionality or whatever I&#39;m not (56:19 - 56:25)
mad that I can&#39;t you know Dynamax my (56:21 - 56:27)
current Lapras that&#39;s fine I I can live (56:25 - 56:30)
with that um I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad in a (56:27 - 56:34)
way I think it&#39;s almost like a a another (56:30 - 56:36)
Milestone or not M like another um (56:34 - 56:40)
objective in a way like for me I loved (56:36 - 56:42)
when level 50 came out because I&#39;m like (56:40 - 56:44)
I have a checklist let&#39;s go baby I got (56:42 - 56:47)
quests like but I already had all of the (56:44 - 56:51)
XP I needed so for me I I hit Level 50 (56:47 - 56:52)
crazy quickly even though I was trying (56:51 - 56:56)
not to um and then I was like no when (56:52 - 56:58)
now I don&#39;t have a little checklist to (56:56 - 57:01)
to go off like and every now and then (56:58 - 57:02)
I&#39;ll remember that like oh yeah Platinum (57:01 - 57:04)
metal Metals exist maybe I&#39;ll try and (57:02 - 57:07)
work towards those or whatever else um (57:04 - 57:09)
but I feel like in terms of endgame and (57:07 - 57:12)
long term there&#39;s not a crazy lot to do (57:09 - 57:13)
unless you&#39;re into PVP and you want to (57:12 - 57:16)
build up like your ideal team or get a (57:13 - 57:18)
bunch of hundos for master League or (57:16 - 57:22)
something um there&#39;s depending what you (57:18 - 57:25)
like and enjoy there might not be um you (57:22 - 57:27)
know an objetive (57:25 - 57:30)
for some players whereas I feel like you (57:27 - 57:32)
know (57:30 - 57:34)
starting depending how difficult it gets (57:32 - 57:35)
you know you could treat it like a (57:34 - 57:38)
Prestige system in a way where it&#39;s like (57:35 - 57:40)
you have to get you&#39;re starting from (57:38 - 57:42)
level one again choose your starter (57:40 - 57:44)
trainer like here&#39;s your Charmander and (57:42 - 57:46)
you know go and walk and get your MP and (57:44 - 57:48)
go and get your Dynamax Charmander like (57:46 - 57:51)
cuz you are you&#39;re starting from from (57:48 - 57:53)
you know the bottom level here and if (57:51 - 57:55)
the end goal is you know aerus or (57:53 - 57:58)
something like you&#39;re going to have to (57:55 - 58:00)
you&#39;re going to have to you know grind (57:58 - 58:02)
again which I don&#39;t think is necessarily (58:00 - 58:04)
bad like maybe there&#39;s people that don&#39;t (58:02 - 58:06)
like those sorts of systems that would (58:04 - 58:08)
be frustrated by it and that&#39;s totally (58:06 - 58:10)
valid as well but um I don&#39;t know I feel (58:08 - 58:13)
like having a new something to work (58:10 - 58:15)
towards I enjoy and if this like my (58:13 - 58:18)
little rat brain likes nice little tasks (58:15 - 58:19)
and nice little lists and things I&#39;m (58:18 - 58:23)
like I think yeah I I think there&#39;s like (58:19 - 58:26)
so many players that they just they they (58:23 - 58:28)
they want to fill their Pokedex or they (58:26 - 58:30)
they they want to catch as many shinies (58:28 - 58:32)
as possible and fill that Shiny Pokedex (58:30 - 58:35)
or they want there&#39;s players that want (58:32 - 58:36)
hundreds they want they want those (58:35 - 58:38)
perfect Pokemon and then there&#39;s those (58:36 - 58:40)
hardcore players that want shiny perfect (58:38 - 58:42)
100s where they&#39;ll keep on doing molt (58:40 - 58:45)
race until it&#39;s shiny and it&#39;s 100 yeah (58:42 - 58:48)
um and there are levels where like I (58:45 - 58:49)
kind of care about that like I (58:48 - 58:50)
definitely care about completing my (58:49 - 58:52)
shiny decks do I care if that shiny is (58:50 - 58:55)
good no like for me it&#39;s like I got the (58:52 - 58:57)
shiny I&#39;ll move (58:55 - 59:00)
um there&#39;s there&#39;s players that about (58:57 - 59:03)
like there&#39;s that the nund (59:00 - 59:06)
the um there&#39;s people that just do AR (59:03 - 59:07)
photography like there&#39;s people that (59:06 - 59:09)
have so many different things in the (59:07 - 59:12)
game where it&#39;s like you know they don&#39;t (59:09 - 59:13)
want the regional to complete the (59:12 - 59:15)
Pokedex they want it to take a picture (59:13 - 59:17)
of it at this cool location that they (59:15 - 59:20)
think it would look really sick in like (59:17 - 59:22)
yeah there&#39;s so many different there&#39;s (59:20 - 59:24)
so many different goals and objectives (59:22 - 59:27)
for so many different players (59:24 - 59:29)
like yeah I don&#39;t know what do you what (59:27 - 59:32)
do you feel about it in that way like I (59:29 - 59:34)
I do feel like I mean I think the the (59:32 - 59:36)
the overarching question is like how (59:34 - 59:39)
does Pokemon go another five six seven (59:36 - 59:42)
eight years especially since we&#39;re like (59:39 - 59:43)
almost done with the (59:42 - 59:45)
Pokedex (59:43 - 59:49)
yeah quick and I think this is a way (59:45 - 59:51)
whether you want to call it padding or (59:49 - 59:53)
not um but I think it is a way to (59:51 - 59:56)
collect Pokemon again you&#39;re just (59:53 - 59:58)
collecting them in Dynamax or gigantamax (59:56 - 60:00)
form and I guess somebody could roll (59:58 - 60:03)
their eyes at that but that&#39;s that&#39;s (60:00 - 60:05)
what I&#39;ve been doing for 28 years like I (60:03 - 60:06)
I bought sword and shield I caught all (60:05 - 60:09)
400 Pokemon the DLC came out I caught (60:06 - 60:11)
all 250 of those Pokemon and then (60:09 - 60:14)
scarlet and violet came out and I could (60:11 - 60:17)
have waited I guess for Pokemon home but (60:14 - 60:18)
I was like I want I like catching these (60:17 - 60:19)
Pokemon so I&#39;m going to catch them all (60:18 - 60:21)
over again I probably caught like good (60:19 - 60:23)
point in a way it&#39;s like we&#39;ve been (60:21 - 60:25)
doing this for almost 30 years where (60:23 - 60:27)
it&#39;s like oh is just starting from (60:25 - 60:29)
scratch again and it&#39;s like my guy if (60:27 - 60:30)
you&#39;ve played Pokémon Yellow you&#39;ve been (60:29 - 60:33)
starting from scratch every 5 years like (60:30 - 60:36)
right right yeah yeah true yeah like you (60:33 - 60:38)
could you could refuse to catch as you (60:36 - 60:40)
go through and just transfer what you&#39;ve (60:38 - 60:42)
caught before minus the Game Boy to Game (60:40 - 60:44)
Boy Advance thing where you couldn&#39;t do (60:42 - 60:45)
that (60:44 - 60:48)
but um but I like genuinely like (60:45 - 60:50)
collecting the Pokedex even though I (60:48 - 60:52)
remember I I I completed all of Pokemon (60:50 - 60:54)
Violet caught all the Pokemon and then I (60:52 - 60:57)
had to do scarlet and I had so many (60:54 - 60:58)
people in my twitch chat be like I can (60:57 - 61:00)
just trade you I can it&#39;s like brother I (60:58 - 61:02)
have them all yeah but I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m (61:00 - 61:04)
catching them again because I genuinely (61:02 - 61:08)
I want to do it yeah yeah yeah yeah like (61:04 - 61:09)
yeah sword and shield was the first time (61:08 - 61:11)
I ever like completed a pokedex and I (61:09 - 61:13)
was like I felt very motivated to do it (61:11 - 61:15)
like like never that had never been my (61:13 - 61:18)
objective in previous games but I was (61:15 - 61:20)
like super Mo I can&#39;t remember I guess (61:18 - 61:23)
why but I don&#39;t know yeah it&#39;s like (61:20 - 61:25)
maybe since Pokémon go as well where (61:23 - 61:26)
it&#39;s kind of like that very much get (61:25 - 61:29)
your little checklist and you know color (61:26 - 61:31)
in that little gray silhouette sort of (61:29 - 61:33)
thing (61:31 - 61:35)
um yeah true we&#39;ve been doing it since (61:33 - 61:38)
day one been doing the same it&#39;s still (61:35 - 61:41)
fun though I guess yeah it&#39;s like oh my (61:38 - 61:42)
God what&#39;s the definition of insanity (61:41 - 61:43)
but it&#39;s like but we&#39;re having a good (61:42 - 61:46)
time so you know yeah I also think of (61:43 - 61:50)
like how I I I also think about like new (61:46 - 61:53)
players right of you know you have this (61:50 - 61:55)
raid system that has existed for seven (61:53 - 61:57)
years cuz there was no raids the first (61:55 - 61:59)
year of the game but like how do you (61:57 - 62:01)
jump into this to be like well you have (61:59 - 62:05)
a 4,000 CP Kyogre and the best thing I (62:01 - 62:10)
got is like a400 War tle yeah um and to (62:05 - 62:11)
have that like okay we&#39;re all kind of (62:10 - 62:13)
starting over but like your your old (62:11 - 62:15)
stuff is not invalidated your old stuff (62:13 - 62:18)
can still be used for the things to me (62:15 - 62:21)
that feels good it feels like do I think (62:18 - 62:23)
the system is perfect no do I think (62:21 - 62:24)
Niantic has always made the best (62:23 - 62:27)
decisions of course not but like (62:24 - 62:31)
I&#39;m trying to see like the negatives of (62:27 - 62:33)
this new system which isn&#39;t just people (62:31 - 62:34)
complaining for the sake of complaining (62:33 - 62:36)
like I I genuinely (62:34 - 62:38)
think this (62:36 - 62:42)
is like a good foundation for the next (62:38 - 62:44)
at least year yeah because it&#39;s kind of (62:42 - 62:46)
like I I don&#39;t see any outright (62:44 - 62:47)
negatives to it because you could just (62:46 - 62:49)
ignore the feature (62:47 - 62:52)
altogether and then assumably like even (62:49 - 62:54)
if you ignored it all the way up until (62:52 - 62:56)
potentially aerus you can probably just (62:54 - 62:58)
trade that bad boy at the end of the day (62:56 - 63:01)
if you really didn&#39;t like Dynamax and (62:58 - 63:04)
Max battles that much that like you just (63:01 - 63:07)
abstained from the entire life cycle of (63:04 - 63:09)
it at the end of the day you could (63:07 - 63:11)
probably just trade for the things that (63:09 - 63:14)
you missed like yeah really unless (63:11 - 63:16)
there&#39;s some sort of like there (63:14 - 63:17)
shouldn&#39;t be like there&#39;s only really (63:16 - 63:18)
mythicals and things that you can&#39;t (63:17 - 63:21)
trade as far as I&#39;m aware and shadows (63:18 - 63:24)
but like you know unless there was some (63:21 - 63:26)
sort of weird (63:24 - 63:29)
new trade rule thing you could just (63:26 - 63:31)
avoid the whole system if you hated it (63:29 - 63:33)
that much if it somehow just bothered (63:31 - 63:35)
you that much but I don&#39;t see an (63:33 - 63:40)
outright negative in it (63:35 - 63:44)
like as just as a feature (63:40 - 63:44)
Kitty like it&#39;s (63:45 - 63:51)
it&#39;s yeah I I I don&#39;t really have (63:48 - 63:53)
any it&#39;s like I don&#39;t really have any (63:51 - 63:55)
hard feelings about it either way cuz (63:53 - 63:57)
it&#39;s kind of just like I mean yeah and (63:55 - 63:58)
here here&#39;s how you used me and it&#39;s (63:57 - 64:01)
it&#39;s kind of pretty easily fitted into a (63:58 - 64:03)
daily gameplay Loop so have fun and I&#39;m (64:01 - 64:06)
like oh all right it functions and it it (64:03 - 64:09)
does what it says on the tin and it&#39;s (64:06 - 64:11)
fun like it&#39;s like a cool it&#39;s like a (64:09 - 64:14)
different little raid kind of style and (64:11 - 64:15)
I&#39;m I&#39;m more curious to see when it is (64:14 - 64:16)
something a bit more difficult because (64:15 - 64:18)
it&#39;s they&#39;re so quick at the moment (64:16 - 64:20)
being to level ones it&#39;s like almost you (64:18 - 64:21)
just sit there and not do anything and (64:20 - 64:24)
it&#39;s done um so I&#39;m definitely curious (64:21 - 64:25)
to see like how the strategy plays in (64:24 - 64:27)
when I gets a bit harder I think that (64:25 - 64:29)
will be interesting to actually have to (64:27 - 64:31)
have a bit of strategy or communicate (64:29 - 64:33)
I&#39;m going to heal and you do Shields and (64:31 - 64:36)
then Steve you attack like I don&#39;t know (64:33 - 64:40)
that&#39;ll be fun I hope (64:36 - 64:42)
um but yeah I I I guess the one thing I (64:40 - 64:45)
will say that is like uh the the coins (64:42 - 64:48)
to like upgrade your rewards oh like (64:45 - 64:51)
sure if you want to make that a thing (64:48 - 64:52)
whatever maybe there&#39;s someone who cares (64:51 - 64:54)
about it move that button somewhere else (64:52 - 64:57)
that is Dodge that that placement and (64:54 - 64:59)
the fact that coloring it&#39;s like dark (64:57 - 65:01)
pattern there yeah yeah there are like (64:59 - 65:03)
full on there&#39;s certain countries where (65:01 - 65:05)
that&#39;s actually illegal um you can&#39;t (65:03 - 65:08)
make a purchase button the same color as (65:05 - 65:11)
like if you already have an established (65:08 - 65:13)
like game language where the green (65:11 - 65:16)
button means like progress to the next (65:13 - 65:18)
mission or whatever and you suddenly (65:16 - 65:21)
make the purchase button the same color (65:18 - 65:24)
in the same placement like game games (65:21 - 65:26)
have been forced to change it move it (65:24 - 65:28)
before because it&#39;s considered like (65:26 - 65:30)
predatory in a lot of um and illegal in (65:28 - 65:33)
a lot of places uh that for me I&#39;m just (65:30 - 65:34)
like that button is dodgy move it (65:33 - 65:36)
somewhere else and make it like red (65:34 - 65:38)
because or you know magenta match the (65:36 - 65:41)
match the theme of the dens or something (65:38 - 65:43)
uh that to me is (65:41 - 65:47)
like that&#39;s no no no no no it is and I (65:43 - 65:49)
I&#39;ve lined up the screenshots it it (65:47 - 65:51)
overlaps with where like the go to bonus (65:49 - 65:53)
challenge button is on raids regular so (65:51 - 65:55)
if you&#39;re from your muscle memory just (65:53 - 65:58)
pressing that same placement I guarantee (65:55 - 65:59)
you someone has accidentally like fat (65:58 - 66:02)
fingered the uh the upgrade by accident (65:59 - 66:04)
I&#39;ve never pressed it is there do you (66:02 - 66:05)
know if there&#39;s like a confirm (66:04 - 66:07)
afterwards I don&#39;t know cuz I don&#39;t want (66:05 - 66:09)
to be the one I&#39;m like I like in a way (66:07 - 66:10)
I&#39;m like maybe I should test it because (66:09 - 66:13)
it&#39;s like as the Creator I&#39;ll take I&#39;ll (66:10 - 66:15)
take the take the fall but like I don&#39;t (66:13 - 66:18)
want to spend my coins I you know I (66:15 - 66:19)
threw myself in gyms for those coins (66:18 - 66:22)
thank you very much like yeah yeah but (66:19 - 66:24)
um I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a confirmed (66:22 - 66:26)
button (66:24 - 66:27)
I I feel like they should move it to the (66:26 - 66:28)
top of the screen where you have to (66:27 - 66:31)
actually like phones are so phones are (66:28 - 66:34)
so big now that you&#39;d have to like reach (66:31 - 66:35)
yes it has to be like a conscious (66:34 - 66:38)
thought yeah yeah that&#39;s my my one (66:35 - 66:40)
negative about the the feature no that&#39;s (66:38 - 66:42)
a good negative like I I definitely saw (66:40 - 66:43)
that and I was like oh people are going (66:42 - 66:44)
to complain about this rightfully so but (66:43 - 66:46)
in my brain of like my mobile brain is (66:44 - 66:48)
like oh this is I just ignore it because (66:46 - 66:50)
it&#39;s like I&#39;m so used to I&#39;m so used to (66:48 - 66:52)
other games asking to upgrade it&#39;s like (66:50 - 66:55)
like I don&#39;t care that it exists like (66:52 - 66:57)
yeah the fact that it exist again Mobile (66:55 - 66:59)
gaming and stuff it&#39;s like it&#39;s become (66:57 - 67:00)
part and parcel of do you want to (66:59 - 67:01)
upgrade your thing do you want an extra (67:00 - 67:04)
life whatever else like that I might (67:01 - 67:06)
sure whatever yeah it&#39;s purely the (67:04 - 67:10)
placement and the color for me that I&#39;m (67:06 - 67:10)
like Wags (67:11 - 67:14)
finger no uh but yeah I guess maybe (67:14 - 67:19)
there is a conversation in there as well (67:18 - 67:21)
about like the fact that it exists is (67:19 - 67:23)
that like you (67:21 - 67:25)
know you know but at the same time it&#39;s (67:23 - 67:28)
kind of of like it&#39;s always technically (67:25 - 67:30)
been a free to-play game there&#39;s still (67:28 - 67:32)
people that I know that are fully free (67:30 - 67:35)
to play um have been since day one sort (67:32 - 67:39)
of thing and they&#39;re you know level 50 (67:35 - 67:43)
um and like you know there&#39;s no could (67:39 - 67:45)
you imagine if it was like watch this ad (67:43 - 67:48)
to hatch your egg faster or like come (67:45 - 67:51)
back in whatever hours to like see if (67:48 - 67:53)
you got a lucky egg like that would be (67:51 - 67:55)
like so disgusting like that would I (67:53 - 67:57)
would hate (67:55 - 67:59)
if if go had those sorts of like mobile (67:57 - 68:02)
game things in it oh yeah so in a way (67:59 - 68:03)
like sure if someone wants to upgrade (68:02 - 68:06)
their their rewards and choose to spend (68:03 - 68:08)
their coins that way whatever more power (68:06 - 68:11)
to them I probably won&#39;t but yeah I (68:08 - 68:13)
probably I probably wouldn&#39;t either (68:11 - 68:15)
unless they are like some phenomenal (68:13 - 68:18)
like unless you know gigantamax raids (68:15 - 68:20)
are giving you some crazy rewards where (68:18 - 68:21)
I&#39;m like (68:20 - 68:26)
oh maybe like but at this stage God know (68:21 - 68:28)
like I&#39;m not putting 200 coins into a (68:26 - 68:31)
raspberry thank you very (68:28 - 68:35)
much with um so like the Dynamax raids (68:31 - 68:37)
rolled out uh but there there&#39;s like the (68:35 - 68:39)
whole season how do you feel about the (68:37 - 68:41)
whole max out season so far we have the (68:39 - 68:44)
oranguru piman research day there was (68:41 - 68:47)
the failinks day there&#39;s the psychic (68:44 - 68:51)
spectacular like as a season how how how (68:47 - 68:53)
are you feeling (68:51 - 68:57)
um I guess like (68:53 - 68:59)
I I hope that there&#39;s a few more like (68:57 - 69:00)
little interesting things throughout the (68:59 - 69:02)
season like (69:00 - 69:04)
sorry like I (69:02 - 69:08)
I I hope that they kind of lean into (69:04 - 69:09)
like the flavor for Halloween and stuff (69:08 - 69:11)
where it&#39;s kind of like have some kind (69:09 - 69:15)
of fun Dynamax things built around that (69:11 - 69:17)
I I hope that we see at least one (69:15 - 69:20)
gigantamax before the season ends sort (69:17 - 69:23)
of thing um otherwise I think it will be (69:20 - 69:26)
a bit of a like yeah it was fine (69:23 - 69:29)
um because it&#39;s it&#39;s a cool feature I (69:26 - 69:31)
feel (69:29 - 69:34)
um and then the I missed the failings (69:31 - 69:37)
right day sadly uh the psychic (69:34 - 69:39)
spectacular awesome you know it&#39;s kind (69:37 - 69:42)
of like new Dynamax Pokemon plus a new (69:39 - 69:45)
new Pokemon as it is like hatan and (69:42 - 69:48)
stuff um cool I like them something new (69:45 - 69:51)
to catch (69:48 - 69:51)
uh I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m ciously optimistic for (69:52 - 70:02)
this for it being like a good season uh (69:57 - 70:06)
I plus I guess for for me like sometimes (70:02 - 70:07)
sometimes (70:06 - 70:10)
the I mean it&#39;s been getting better over (70:07 - 70:11)
the last few years but like sometimes it (70:10 - 70:13)
would be like you know the end of year (70:11 - 70:15)
sort of stuff would get a bit quieter (70:13 - 70:16)
because you know it&#39;s winter for you (70:15 - 70:18)
guys in the Northern Hemisphere and like (70:16 - 70:19)
southern hemisphere is like sick we get (70:18 - 70:21)
like no good raid bosses and like (70:19 - 70:22)
everything&#39;s a bit dull like when we can (70:21 - 70:25)
go outside but sure we have to go out in (70:22 - 70:26)
the cold weather and (70:25 - 70:29)
um so I I guess it&#39;s it&#39;s looking good (70:26 - 70:31)
especially for like going outside and (70:29 - 70:36)
playing sort of stuff um (70:31 - 70:39)
I there&#39;s no like I don&#39;t know it&#39;s kind (70:36 - 70:40)
of like there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s making me (70:39 - 70:42)
like oh my God like I want to run out (70:40 - 70:45)
and pump my fists in the air and like (70:42 - 70:47)
crazy celebrate but at the same time I&#39;m (70:45 - 70:49)
not just like skip you know which I have (70:47 - 70:50)
I have been some Seasons where I&#39;m just (70:49 - 70:53)
like nah dog I&#39;ll see you next month (70:50 - 70:57)
like I&#39;m not you know so at least I I (70:53 - 70:59)
feel (70:57 - 71:02)
like uh I feel bothered to do it I feel (70:59 - 71:04)
like there&#39;s things that I like oh yeah (71:02 - 71:08)
I&#39;ll get out I&#39;ll get and check that out (71:04 - 71:10)
um I I feel like that I I feel like (71:08 - 71:13)
there really needs to be like a gmax or (71:10 - 71:15)
something or like something more tricky (71:13 - 71:18)
early on to really get people to be like (71:15 - 71:19)
all right Champions you&#39;ve had a couple (71:18 - 71:23)
of weeks to get your foundation like go (71:19 - 71:26)
and see your friends again like and play (71:23 - 71:29)
in a group again sort of thing yeah cuz (71:26 - 71:30)
I (71:29 - 71:32)
I I feel like (71:30 - 71:34)
it&#39;s we have those massive Peaks where (71:32 - 71:37)
it&#39;s you know the go Fest events and you (71:34 - 71:39)
know we had 200 people at my one of our (71:37 - 71:41)
local parks I was like whoa everyone&#39;s (71:39 - 71:44)
back like this is crazy like you know I (71:41 - 71:46)
haven&#39;t seen all these people in one (71:44 - 71:48)
spot in so long and then it&#39;s like all (71:46 - 71:51)
right bye you know kind of dries back (71:48 - 71:55)
off so if it if it does Foster those (71:51 - 71:56)
communities again I think that&#39;s going (71:55 - 71:59)
to be like add to the the fun of the (71:56 - 72:01)
Season what about you what are you (71:59 - 72:03)
feeling season (72:01 - 72:09)
wise um I feel like it is a good season (72:03 - 72:11)
uh and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s like a good (72:09 - 72:13)
season because there&#39;s a whole new (72:11 - 72:17)
mechanic uh but it&#39;s I think like what (72:13 - 72:19)
like the hatching event specifically (72:17 - 72:20)
it&#39;s like okay we&#39;re introducing a new (72:19 - 72:23)
Pokemon but we&#39;re also introducing a new (72:20 - 72:26)
Dynamax Pokemon and that just feels like (72:23 - 72:30)
there&#39;s more to do especially where like (72:26 - 72:31)
I have all the megas so anytime they&#39;re (72:30 - 72:33)
like we&#39;re bringing back this Mega it&#39;s (72:31 - 72:35)
like okay skip like I got I got so much (72:33 - 72:37)
candy of that I&#39;m sure some people have (72:35 - 72:39)
missed it or at any point where they&#39;re (72:37 - 72:41)
like we&#39;re bringing back Articuno or (72:39 - 72:45)
Lugia or Kyogre like skip like I I I did (72:41 - 72:49)
all that too so um I guess my excitement (72:45 - 72:51)
with the Dynamax and why I&#39;m positive on (72:49 - 72:53)
it is because it feels like when there&#39;s (72:51 - 72:54)
an event now there will also be new (72:53 - 72:56)
Dynamax stuff and it&#39;s like cool that&#39;s (72:54 - 72:59)
what I care about and other people might (72:56 - 73:01)
be like Oh I&#39;m I I&#39;m going to wait till (72:59 - 73:04)
they bring back uh I don&#39;t know coal (73:01 - 73:07)
calian or something where for me that&#39;s (73:04 - 73:09)
like skip when&#39;s Lugia coming back you (73:07 - 73:10)
know it&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve had a (73:09 - 73:12)
Lugia (73:10 - 73:15)
right the emergency I need some (73:12 - 73:20)
candy um yeah yeah I (73:15 - 73:23)
and I guess the like local only of (73:20 - 73:27)
Dynamax doesn&#39;t buy bother me because (73:23 - 73:29)
one I&#39;m in a big city so that&#39;s never (73:27 - 73:31)
been like a super big problem I totally (73:29 - 73:34)
understand people in not big cities with (73:31 - 73:36)
no one to play I get that I&#39;ve always (73:34 - 73:38)
said Pokemon go is like an incredibly (73:36 - 73:42)
unfair game um just based on where you (73:38 - 73:44)
live like I&#39;ve been to the middle of (73:42 - 73:46)
nowhere for an entire week and I&#39;m if I (73:44 - 73:47)
was like if I lived here I would never (73:46 - 73:50)
play this game um but it&#39;s the same time (73:47 - 73:51)
though it&#39;s like if (73:50 - 73:54)
you it&#39;s it&#39;s very unfair yes for Rural (73:51 - 73:55)
players but at the same time I&#39;m like to (73:54 - 73:57)
your friends like if your friends don&#39;t (73:55 - 74:00)
play Pokémon go just like hey Timmy come (73:57 - 74:02)
and play Pokémon go with me I don&#39;t want (74:00 - 74:05)
to play that it&#39;s like well I I do you (74:02 - 74:07)
know come and play and then we&#39;ll go do (74:05 - 74:08)
something you want to do sort of thing (74:07 - 74:12)
like I don&#39;t know um at a certain point (74:08 - 74:14)
like unless you&#39;re that rural that you (74:12 - 74:16)
literally are on like you don&#39;t even see (74:14 - 74:19)
your neighbors for a month at a time (74:16 - 74:21)
there&#39;s probably going to be someone (74:19 - 74:24)
else in the in in the town and if not (74:21 - 74:26)
like talk to people like like hey you (74:24 - 74:28)
heard about this game it&#39;s pretty fun (74:26 - 74:32)
like I do you have a mom ask your mom to (74:28 - 74:34)
play with you like so many people have (74:32 - 74:37)
like had really good um relationships (74:34 - 74:39)
and friendships and like family (74:37 - 74:40)
connections like get way stronger (74:39 - 74:42)
because of the game being like and some (74:40 - 74:44)
parents like oh watch this silly guy oh (74:42 - 74:45)
what do you want me to do this for and (74:44 - 74:47)
it&#39;s like come on Mom just like come for (74:45 - 74:50)
a walk and you know catch these (74:47 - 74:52)
creatures and then it&#39;s like something (74:50 - 74:54)
they do every week then and it&#39;s like a (74:52 - 74:56)
really nice a nice little little habit (74:54 - 74:57)
or like nice little ritual sort of thing (74:56 - 74:59)
but yeah yeah it could be that maybe I (74:57 - 75:01)
don&#39;t have like social anxiety but I (74:59 - 75:03)
like remember games outside of Pokémon (75:01 - 75:05)
go where you needed like Destiny is the (75:03 - 75:06)
example I always bring up like there was (75:05 - 75:10)
no in-game way to form a group in that (75:06 - 75:11)
game so you had to go to like a (75:10 - 75:13)
subreddit or go to a fan-made website (75:11 - 75:15)
yeah and post that like you&#39;re looking (75:13 - 75:20)
for other people um and then you just (75:15 - 75:21)
with strangers you just like you got the (75:20 - 75:23)
thing done and it would take an hour (75:21 - 75:25)
hour and a half and you would do that I (75:23 - 75:27)
would do that three four times a week (75:25 - 75:31)
and um but I yeah I get like if if if (75:27 - 75:33)
you don&#39;t want to be the person to start (75:31 - 75:36)
something or to say hi I get it but I (75:33 - 75:40)
stand as well uh I I you know it&#39;s been (75:36 - 75:42)
so long since the remote raid price (75:40 - 75:44)
increase and I think niantic&#39;s not (75:42 - 75:47)
really wavering on the local aspects of (75:44 - 75:51)
these games no I don&#39;t think so it&#39;s (75:47 - 75:53)
kind of like yeah I mean I guess through (75:51 - 75:55)
the through their actions and stuff (75:53 - 75:56)
that&#39;s like theyve they&#39;ve shown that (75:55 - 75:59)
they&#39;re not I I don&#39;t see them changing (75:56 - 76:02)
that anytime soon but I don&#39;t want to (75:59 - 76:05)
say like this feature is bad because (76:02 - 76:08)
it&#39;s local only because no no I I don&#39;t (76:05 - 76:10)
think so there still there&#39;s probably (76:08 - 76:11)
still going to be enough legs in it to (76:10 - 76:13)
do like I&#39;m curious to see like when (76:11 - 76:16)
Beldum comes out what this week um you (76:13 - 76:19)
know can you do it solo I I want to test (76:16 - 76:21)
out doing it solo with one that&#39;s not (76:19 - 76:23)
powered like my Charmander three (76:21 - 76:24)
Charmander they haven&#39;t even given a (76:23 - 76:27)
special move to can you do it with your (76:24 - 76:29)
you know one Charizard that you&#39;ve not (76:27 - 76:31)
powered up its moves with like you know (76:29 - 76:33)
can at what point can you kind of still (76:31 - 76:35)
if you were that one person in the (76:33 - 76:37)
middle of nowhere with you don&#39;t have (76:35 - 76:38)
your mom to come and play with you (76:37 - 76:41)
either like you are that guy could you (76:38 - 76:44)
still participate sort of thing so I am (76:41 - 76:45)
curious to see how far you can push it (76:44 - 76:48)
if you&#39;re willing to you know do the (76:45 - 76:52)
solo play side of it um like um and (76:48 - 76:54)
difference like what&#39;s the difference (76:52 - 76:56)
between (76:54 - 76:58)
doing the raid with uh like let&#39;s just (76:56 - 77:00)
say Beldum and you&#39;re solo doing the (76:58 - 77:03)
raid with a Charmander solo with no (77:00 - 77:06)
people that left any behind Charmander (77:03 - 77:08)
solo with five people who have left (77:06 - 77:11)
something behind and then Charizard no (77:08 - 77:13)
people Charizard with five people yeah (77:11 - 77:17)
like I think the the adding (77:13 - 77:19)
people should (77:17 - 77:23)
matter yeah it says it does it it (77:19 - 77:26)
alleges it alleges to yeah and like how (77:23 - 77:28)
strong is Charmander at 1500 CP versus (77:26 - 77:31)
3,000 CP versus Char like there&#39;s just (77:28 - 77:33)
so many factors that I think like that&#39;s (77:31 - 77:35)
what makes me excited for like that leg (77:33 - 77:36)
work because even though I&#39;m in a big (77:35 - 77:38)
I&#39;m like I&#39;m in the I played this (77:36 - 77:39)
feature in the biggest city in the (77:38 - 77:41)
United States New York I was in New York (77:39 - 77:43)
yeah every every gym had five Pokemon in (77:41 - 77:46)
it or power spot had five Pokemon in it (77:43 - 77:48)
so did you see like have you seen like (77:46 - 77:50)
what the maximum is I don&#39;t even know (77:48 - 77:51)
what the maximum is I think it&#39;s either (77:50 - 77:54)
five or six I&#39;ve seen ones with 15 like (77:51 - 77:58)
left in them defend really yeah (77:54 - 78:00)
yeah my the biggest I saw I get up to in (77:58 - 78:02)
my area I haven&#39;t checked in a few days (78:00 - 78:05)
um was I think 16 and I just forgot to (78:02 - 78:07)
check before it ended that night but I&#39;m (78:05 - 78:10)
like I don&#39;t live in a crazy busy City (78:07 - 78:12)
like I want to see like Tokyo or New (78:10 - 78:14)
York or whatever else maybe there&#39;s (78:12 - 78:16)
someone&#39;s maybe someone&#39;s posted it by (78:14 - 78:18)
now like what the actual Max is yeah in (78:16 - 78:19)
New York it wouldn&#39;t let me leave any (78:18 - 78:21)
Pokemon behind it was just like full (78:19 - 78:24)
full full full um so maybe there was (78:21 - 78:26)
maybe there was I think the default view (78:24 - 78:27)
is you can see five standing in front (78:26 - 78:29)
but then the top corner where the trophy (78:27 - 78:31)
like where the little trophy is in the (78:29 - 78:33)
corner will have a number next to it and (78:31 - 78:34)
that&#39;s like how many people are in there (78:33 - 78:36)
yeah got it got it okay yeah because I (78:34 - 78:39)
always saw like five people um yeah uh (78:36 - 78:41)
so yeah I&#39;m curious how many you could (78:39 - 78:44)
leave but I like the leaving the Pokemon (78:41 - 78:47)
to get candy helping other people uh I (78:44 - 78:48)
just (78:47 - 78:51)
like it was like maybe I don&#39;t know I (78:48 - 78:52)
would love to be in a meeting with (78:51 - 78:54)
Niantic but it would be like H we have (78:52 - 78:57)
this current raid system how do we make (78:54 - 78:59)
it better and I feel like they they they (78:57 - 79:03)
did yeah uh with at the cost of like (78:59 - 79:04)
okay everyone&#39;s going to start on this (79:03 - 79:06)
at at everyone&#39;s going to start in the (79:04 - 79:08)
same (79:06 - 79:10)
place I think I think they can still (79:08 - 79:13)
live (79:10 - 79:15)
sorry I feel like both systems can still (79:13 - 79:17)
like live Co coexist sort of thing like (79:15 - 79:18)
I don&#39;t think everyone&#39;s going to like (79:17 - 79:21)
suddenly maybe I&#39;m wrong but (79:18 - 79:23)
um I don&#39;t think everyone&#39;s going to (79:21 - 79:25)
suddenly like quit doing raids because (79:23 - 79:27)
oh sure Dynamax battles are here like I (79:25 - 79:29)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s all over sort of thing (79:27 - 79:30)
but (79:29 - 79:33)
um I I imagine there&#39;ll be like a bit of (79:30 - 79:34)
a a pivot where it&#39;s kind of like (79:33 - 79:38)
Dynamax will be the The Golden Child for (79:34 - 79:40)
everyone&#39;s like oh this is the fun sorry (79:38 - 79:42)
this is the fun you thing let&#39;s do this (79:40 - 79:44)
for a bit um and then maybe it&#39;ll like (79:42 - 79:47)
balance out a bit more yeah I I think (79:44 - 79:49)
it&#39;s it&#39;s (79:47 - 79:51)
a it&#39;s (79:49 - 79:54)
fun it&#39;s fun she says tentatively like (79:51 - 79:56)
hoping that nothing bad happens and they (79:54 - 80:00)
just change it in like as of this date (79:56 - 80:03)
and time I think it&#39;s a I think it&#39;s fun (80:00 - 80:07)
yeah yeah I hope is fun yeah I was told (80:03 - 80:10)
to ask you about AR and they&#39;ve made (80:07 - 80:13)
some changes and I know you&#39;re into the (80:10 - 80:15)
AR stuff so how do you feel with the (80:13 - 80:17)
current changes of AR I know that wasn&#39;t (80:15 - 80:19)
like recent recent but I was like (80:17 - 80:21)
something&#39;s changed (80:19 - 80:24)
once uh which one which which changes (80:21 - 80:26)
like the the AR (80:24 - 80:28)
yeah and then they they added like the (80:26 - 80:30)
three Pokemon which was I think oh yeah (80:28 - 80:33)
yeah sorry like the the refresh yes um (80:30 - 80:34)
the clippy aty thing that was a bit (80:33 - 80:36)
before I think that still looks a bit a (80:34 - 80:38)
bit Jank depending what phone you&#39;re on (80:36 - 80:40)
um but the the (80:38 - 80:43)
new in a way I&#39;m kind of sad that the (80:40 - 80:45)
taking a photo with your friend thing is (80:43 - 80:48)
gone like I get it it was a pain in the (80:45 - 80:49)
butt to get it to work correctly a lot (80:48 - 80:54)
of the time but it was still nice like (80:49 - 80:55)
the sentiment was still nice I hope that (80:54 - 80:57)
they bring back something like that even (80:55 - 80:59)
in this new system in the future cuz (80:57 - 81:02)
that is like quite sweet the fact that (80:59 - 81:03)
you can just take like three of your own (81:02 - 81:06)
Pokémon in position them the rotation (81:03 - 81:09)
feature thing is so much better like it (81:06 - 81:12)
is so much smoother I think depending on (81:09 - 81:14)
phone and even even for me still and (81:12 - 81:17)
this has been a thing before the update (81:14 - 81:19)
uh my a will perform differently if I&#39;m (81:17 - 81:21)
using the Google Store version or the (81:19 - 81:24)
Samsung the Galaxy store version of the (81:21 - 81:27)
app the is so different I think they (81:24 - 81:28)
need to sort that out like that it is (81:27 - 81:32)
and even iPhone for AR is like smooth as (81:28 - 81:34)
um it&#39;s really annoying that there&#39;s so (81:32 - 81:36)
much discrepancy between like I&#39;m still (81:34 - 81:39)
on this it&#39;s the same phone but just (81:36 - 81:41)
swapping between the versions of the app (81:39 - 81:44)
it is different uh to the point where (81:41 - 81:45)
like sometimes I can&#39;t even place a (81:44 - 81:48)
Pokemon on the Google Store version (81:45 - 81:49)
because it just won&#39;t find the floor and (81:48 - 81:51)
I&#39;m like pleaseed for the love of God (81:49 - 81:53)
just like it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a wooden (81:51 - 81:56)
floor like it&#39;s not that it&#39;s flat it&#39;s (81:53 - 81:59)
not that difficult um and then you open (81:56 - 82:01)
it up the exact same spot on the other (81:59 - 82:04)
app and it&#39;s like places perfectly um (82:01 - 82:07)
but yeah I think it works a lot a lot (82:04 - 82:09)
simpler like the fact that you can kind (82:07 - 82:11)
like drag and drop to place them where (82:09 - 82:13)
you want them to be is a lot better um (82:11 - 82:15)
you can control like flying Pokemon and (82:13 - 82:17)
being up in the air versus standing on (82:15 - 82:22)
the ground um big fan big thumbs up like (82:17 - 82:24)
uh I think overall like a massive (82:22 - 82:26)
quality you Improvement now they just (82:24 - 82:27)
need to make it so that the photo (82:26 - 82:30)
quality is actually photo quality and (82:27 - 82:31)
not like screenshot quality that would (82:30 - 82:35)
be Aces I swear like the first year of (82:31 - 82:37)
photo stuff it was wasn&#39;t it it was it (82:35 - 82:39)
was photo quality the first like year (82:37 - 82:41)
and a half I think uh and then at some (82:39 - 82:44)
point it was just like we&#39;ve changed it (82:41 - 82:46)
screenshot yeah to us a screenshot and (82:44 - 82:49)
I&#39;m like why though (82:46 - 82:52)
like I don&#39;t know that that like that (82:49 - 82:53)
that bothers me still to this day and (82:52 - 82:56)
even yeah it&#39;s a yeah (82:53 - 82:59)
it&#39;s I get big mad cuz I&#39;m like I want a (82:56 - 83:01)
nice quality photo like I want to be (82:59 - 83:03)
able to like post it it doesn&#39;t look (83:01 - 83:08)
like crunchy yeah yeah know yeah but um (83:03 - 83:10)
yeah big thumbs up overall uh for the (83:08 - 83:13)
update I think cool a lot (83:10 - 83:16)
easier uh last question so we don&#39;t run (83:13 - 83:19)
super super Far Over uh (83:16 - 83:21)
if I think this this I guess I thought (83:19 - 83:23)
of this question when I saw people upset (83:21 - 83:27)
about Dynamax because I feel like they (83:23 - 83:28)
might be upset because one they don&#39;t (83:27 - 83:30)
care about it but two they maybe think (83:28 - 83:33)
that like Niantic could be working on (83:30 - 83:37)
anything else instead of this so if you (83:33 - 83:39)
were to a if you were able to convince (83:37 - 83:41)
Niantic of anything and I know Niantic (83:39 - 83:43)
does listen to Listen to content (83:41 - 83:45)
creators is maybe a stretch they do hear (83:43 - 83:48)
us I don&#39;t know if they yeah my message (83:45 - 83:51)
has been seen you know two SE they at (83:48 - 83:53)
least see the messages whether or not (83:51 - 83:57)
they listen so if if Niantic was to (83:53 - 83:59)
listen what would you tell them that (83:57 - 84:01)
needs to be fixed or worked on or what (83:59 - 84:03)
changed in Pokemon go like if if you (84:01 - 84:06)
could convince them to do I this isn&#39;t (84:03 - 84:08)
going to be like a fun one but I I feel (84:06 - 84:10)
like I&#39;ve been saying for ages I&#39;m like (84:08 - 84:11)
can we just take a month off and you (84:10 - 84:15)
just fix the Jank like for the love of (84:11 - 84:18)
my battery depletes at an alarming level (84:15 - 84:21)
these days like I I playing playing (84:18 - 84:23)
Pokémon go now with all of these (84:21 - 84:24)
features if my phone is plugged into a (84:23 - 84:27)
power pack and playing Pokémon go (84:24 - 84:31)
simultaneously I do not gain charge it (84:27 - 84:33)
will hold the line it&#39;ll do these ones (84:31 - 84:37)
like like it&#39;s holding that like 50% for (84:33 - 84:39)
dear life but it will not gain charge (84:37 - 84:41)
and I&#39;m like this is not an old phone (84:39 - 84:45)
like this is this is insane like the (84:41 - 84:46)
what is going on with the optimization (84:45 - 84:49)
in the app the amount of lag that I get (84:46 - 84:51)
now is getting really (84:49 - 84:56)
frustrating um just overall polish like (84:51 - 84:59)
that&#39;s that&#39;s for me I&#39;m like if I give (84:56 - 85:01)
me a month of like give me a month of (84:59 - 85:04)
Lugia raids you know if it means that I (85:01 - 85:09)
love Lugia uh if it means that the um (85:04 - 85:11)
just the overall game state was a little (85:09 - 85:13)
bit more functional like there&#39;s still a (85:11 - 85:15)
bunch of issues with GBL that have been (85:13 - 85:18)
going on for forever and like I I really (85:15 - 85:23)
just want it to be like a a tightly (85:18 - 85:26)
performing as little laggy frustrating (85:23 - 85:27)
things as possible because there&#39;s just (85:26 - 85:29)
so many things piling up at the moment (85:27 - 85:31)
where I&#39;m just like it&#39;s getting (85:29 - 85:33)
annoying and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t want to be (85:31 - 85:35)
annoyed just playing the game day-to-day (85:33 - 85:37)
regularly like if I&#39;m getting frustrated (85:35 - 85:39)
it&#39;s just like sick I can&#39;t even go for (85:37 - 85:41)
a walk without having to carry a power (85:39 - 85:42)
pack these days like (85:41 - 85:46)
that&#39;s insane yeah um but if I was gonna (85:42 - 85:47)
I don&#39;t know if I was G to (85:46 - 85:49)
make if I was going to answer the (85:47 - 85:51)
question in a fun (85:49 - 85:53)
way (85:51 - 85:56)
um ah (85:53 - 85:58)
are we saying like I could change (85:56 - 86:00)
anything in the past as well (85:58 - 86:03)
like or we thinking like new features I (86:00 - 86:06)
feel like I mean if we Chang things in (86:03 - 86:07)
the past everyone&#39;s going to be big mad (86:06 - 86:09)
if I didn&#39;t just say like raid remote (86:07 - 86:11)
raids um but you&#39;re not a big Raider so (86:09 - 86:12)
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s like a fair (86:11 - 86:15)
answer huh I said but you&#39;re not like a (86:12 - 86:16)
big Raider yourself so I don&#39;t know if (86:15 - 86:18)
that&#39;s a fair answer but i&#39; be like I&#39;d (86:16 - 86:19)
take one for the team if if it was (86:18 - 86:22)
guaranteed you know and Zoe had the (86:19 - 86:25)
chance to had to make a wish wish to (86:22 - 86:27)
make anything happen and she didn&#39;t it (86:25 - 86:31)
REM be so annoyed to me um I know let&#39;s (86:27 - 86:32)
let&#39;s just say okay I&#39;m not going to (86:31 - 86:33)
change anything in the past because (86:32 - 86:36)
they&#39;re probably not um (86:33 - 86:40)
yeah give Australian event uh I I feel (86:36 - 86:42)
like there&#39;s a lot of (86:40 - 86:45)
other really cool potential features to (86:42 - 86:48)
be explored like the gyms need a rework (86:45 - 86:49)
in terms of like what&#39;s going on with (86:48 - 86:50)
gyms or do they I don&#39;t know maybe they (86:49 - 86:53)
can just stay how they&#39;ve always been um (86:50 - 86:54)
I&#39;ve always been curious of how they (86:53 - 86:56)
Implement you know breeding in the game (86:54 - 86:59)
where it&#39;s kind of like you know hey dpy (86:56 - 87:01)
just came out do you want to guarantee (86:59 - 87:05)
dpy egg go and go and see Steve down in (87:01 - 87:07)
the park and make your Pokemon high five (87:05 - 87:09)
and then you know you both get a dpy egg (87:07 - 87:11)
you have to walk a bit longer because (87:09 - 87:14)
it&#39;s a guaranteed you know it&#39;s a insert (87:11 - 87:17)
obscene amount of kilometers here um I (87:14 - 87:19)
don&#39;t want to give them ideas I&#39;m not (87:17 - 87:20)
going to say too many kilometers but (87:19 - 87:23)
like you know you both get a drapy egg (87:20 - 87:24)
and you can only do that once per week (87:23 - 87:26)
but it&#39;s guarant to be guaranteed to be (87:24 - 87:28)
you know a dpy then go and meet up again (87:26 - 87:30)
the next week you know you got that (87:28 - 87:32)
in-person social interaction you got (87:30 - 87:34)
outdoor exploration you have to go out (87:32 - 87:36)
and find them in real life you&#39;re going (87:34 - 87:38)
to have to walk longer to hatch the egg (87:36 - 87:40)
you know I think there&#39;s a lot of other (87:38 - 87:43)
fun cool mechanics that could be (87:40 - 87:44)
introduced that aren&#39;t (87:43 - 87:49)
just go to POI and battle big one oh (87:44 - 87:51)
sure yeah yeah because it&#39;s still fun (87:49 - 87:53)
like again the the max battles and stuff (87:51 - 87:55)
still fun but I feel like there&#39;s (87:53 - 87:57)
definitely room for (87:55 - 88:01)
more creative ways to still have all of (87:57 - 88:03)
those things they want with the social (88:01 - 88:04)
the exploration the like physical (88:03 - 88:09)
activity mhm um and not just (88:04 - 88:12)
be go to gym and battle go to gym and do (88:09 - 88:16)
raid go to Pink gym and do raid (88:12 - 88:19)
essentially yeah sure um yeah I&#39;d be (88:16 - 88:21)
cuur I&#39;d be curious to see them expore (88:19 - 88:24)
something like that but please just fix (88:21 - 88:25)
the the lag for (88:24 - 88:28)
the that&#39;s my (88:25 - 88:30)
request yeah I always thought it would (88:28 - 88:33)
be cool uh with specifically with (88:30 - 88:35)
Legends archus I don&#39;t know how much of (88:33 - 88:38)
that you played so too much criminal (88:35 - 88:41)
amount um but like Niantic knows where (88:38 - 88:44)
parks are because that&#39;s where nests are (88:41 - 88:46)
uh so they they they know instantly what (88:44 - 88:48)
is a park what is a mall what is a (88:46 - 88:52)
parking lot (88:48 - 88:52)
yeah uh thought it would always be cool (88:53 - 88:58)
to like you said instead of just going (88:55 - 89:00)
to spot battle and then you&#39;re done (88:58 - 89:02)
which is pretty much all the pois at (89:00 - 89:04)
this point um it would be cool if you (89:02 - 89:07)
could do the uh what was that Dome that (89:04 - 89:11)
would appear the oh yeah uh the (89:07 - 89:12)
Distortion oh surely they&#39;re going to (89:11 - 89:14)
have to do something like that now oh my (89:12 - 89:17)
God it would be cool if a park could (89:14 - 89:19)
have a distortion yeah uh even if it was (89:17 - 89:21)
like once a day for 5 10 minutes and you (89:19 - 89:23)
could see that oh a distortion is going (89:21 - 89:25)
to start in like 2 hours in the distance (89:23 - 89:27)
dude that&#39;d be sick and then that would (89:25 - 89:29)
encourage players in the neighborhood to (89:27 - 89:31)
be like oh my gosh a distortion at 3:00 (89:29 - 89:33)
let&#39;s walk to the park inside the (89:31 - 89:34)
Distortion is Pokemon that don&#39;t (89:33 - 89:37)
normally spawn for 10 minutes and then (89:34 - 89:39)
all of a sudden you have forced people (89:37 - 89:41)
to come over that isn&#39;t a raid that (89:39 - 89:43)
isn&#39;t a battle Bigg area it&#39;s like a (89:41 - 89:45)
wild catch area (89:43 - 89:49)
like Steve give sign this man&#39;s check (89:45 - 89:51)
like let&#39;s go pay them in we got ideas (89:49 - 89:55)
for days over here yeah yeah and I&#39;m uh (89:51 - 89:57)
surprised there wasn&#39;t anything around (89:55 - 89:59)
like well I mean when we went to c tour (89:57 - 90:01)
it was like 15 minutes of this 15 (89:59 - 90:03)
minutes of that that was (90:01 - 90:05)
like kind of doing it because the sky (90:03 - 90:08)
would at least change color yeah but I&#39;d (90:05 - 90:10)
be yeah the sky thing was cool i&#39;&#39;d be (90:08 - 90:11)
I&#39;d be cool I think that would be (90:10 - 90:13)
excellent like distortions as well cuz (90:11 - 90:14)
again it&#39;s like a visual on the map you (90:13 - 90:16)
could see it&#39;s an incentive to go over (90:14 - 90:18)
and walk to do it right other people are (90:16 - 90:19)
going to be there because everyone&#39;s (90:18 - 90:21)

future if we didn&#39;t get you know the the (90:23 - 90:27)
month&#39;s notice that it was going to (90:25 - 90:28)
happen like could you imagine opening up (90:27 - 90:31)

go event specifically this is Pokémon go (96:26 - 96:30)
but also sports related I&#39;m just going (96:28 - 96:34)
to read what mlb.com says here how MLB (96:30 - 96:36)
is advertising this I (96:34 - 96:38)
guess it says whether you&#39;re a team (96:36 - 96:41)
Instinct Mystic or Valor we&#39;re inviting (96:38 - 96:43)
you to our first ever Pokemon go night (96:41 - 96:46)

obviously just happened but they&#39;re (96:46 - 96:51)
saying first ever which means more are (96:47 - 96:53)
coming check out the details before (96:51 - 96:55)
below with exclusive tickets uh so (96:53 - 96:58)
here&#39;s here&#39;s the details join in with (96:55 - 97:00)
other trainers in a one-of-a-kind raid (96:58 - 97:03)

surprise with a guaranteed location (97:03 - 97:08)
background take part in exclusive timed (97:05 - 97:10)
research granted to fans within the (97:08 - 97:13)
ballpark after 7:10 p.m. explore the (97:10 - 97:17)
ballpark in a new allnew official route (97:13 - 97:19)
I would assume the route is just to go (97:17 - 97:22)
around the outside of the stadium right (97:19 - 97:25)
most stadiums stadiums are circles (97:22 - 97:30)
yeah rectangles maybe ovals ovals yeah (97:25 - 97:33)
score a Mariners themed Pokémon go (97:30 - 97:36)
t-shirt that represents your team colors (97:33 - 97:38)
plus stick around after the game for a (97:36 - 97:42)
dance firework show featuring playlists (97:38 - 97:46)
curated by world famous DJ Diplo uh and (97:42 - 97:49)
then all the Niantic copyright Pokemon (97:46 - 97:53)
copyright etc etc uh your purchase so (97:49 - 97:56)
for specially paired $42 for main level (97:53 - 97:57)
or (97:56 - 98:02)
$26 for view level to the Friday (97:57 - 98:04)
September 13th game your choice of (98:02 - 98:07)
mariners themed Pokémon go t-shirt uh (98:04 - 98:10)
please note t-shirts must be selected at (98:07 - 98:15)
time of purchase uh (98:10 - 98:18)
so so for $42 you&#39;re getting main level (98:15 - 98:21)
view of the baseball game and you&#39;re (98:18 - 98:23)
getting a T-shirt and then for $26 (98:21 - 98:25)
you&#39;re getting a worse view but you&#39;re (98:23 - 98:28)
still also getting a t-shirt yes so the (98:25 - 98:30)
way that this typically okay so a couple (98:28 - 98:32)
things first off this is specific to the (98:30 - 98:36)
Seattle Mariners so this was not like (98:32 - 98:38)
every baseball stadium right there are (98:36 - 98:41)
30 30 team 30ish teams I don&#39;t know if (98:38 - 98:43)
it&#39;s 30 32 I forget where the the (98:41 - 98:46)
expansion uh put it at but so this is (98:43 - 98:49)
specific to the Seattle Mariners uh a (98:46 - 98:51)
lot of times when they do these event (98:49 - 98:54)
nights so Steve saying that like we&#39;re (98:51 - 98:56)
not Sports Experts okay I grew up with (98:54 - 98:58)
Padres season tickets so I went to a lot (98:56 - 99:01)
of baseball games growing up you know (98:58 - 99:05)
what so uh when they have these special (99:01 - 99:08)
nights there&#39;s usually a giveaway of (99:05 - 99:12)
sorts and that comes with whatever (99:08 - 99:14)
you&#39;ve purchased right so you typically (99:12 - 99:16)
purchase a ticket to the game and then (99:14 - 99:18)
you get some giveaway maybe a hat maybe (99:16 - 99:22)
a shirt so uh in this case it does sort (99:18 - 99:25)
of look like there&#39;s only two there were (99:22 - 99:27)
only two prices like the main level and (99:25 - 99:29)
the view level I&#39;m sure there are many (99:27 - 99:31)
other tickets you can purchase for (99:29 - 99:33)
different different places in the (99:31 - 99:36)
stadium um but it is weird like I don&#39;t (99:33 - 99:37)
know if you had to purchase one of these (99:36 - 99:40)
two specific tickets to get the the (99:37 - 99:43)
shirt as well like if you bought the (99:40 - 99:46)
right behind the home plate like $500 (99:43 - 99:48)
ticket did you not get a Pokemon go (99:46 - 99:51)
T-shirt with your purchase uh that night (99:48 - 99:54)
I don&#39;t know but um but yeah typically (99:51 - 99:57)
like this kind of giveaway shirt or (99:54 - 99:58)
whatever it comes with when you purchase (99:57 - 100:00)
a ticket when the when there&#39;s like a (99:58 - 100:05)
theme night for for the the game um and (100:00 - 100:07)
the price seems really good these seem (100:05 - 100:09)
like prices you could usually just get a (100:07 - 100:12)
shirt only for those prices with the (100:09 - 100:15)
Pokemon tax yeah that is true I do (100:12 - 100:16)
wonder what (100:15 - 100:19)
the quality of the shirt is so sometimes (100:16 - 100:22)
it&#39;s not they&#39;re (100:19 - 100:27)
not uh they looked okay I think but so (100:22 - 100:29)
my question is uh and Hannah maybe you (100:27 - 100:32)
can ex expand on this but uh the first (100:29 - 100:35)
line here says uh join him with trainers (100:32 - 100:37)
uh in one of aind raid battles featuring (100:35 - 100:41)
Pikachu and a special surprise with a (100:37 - 100:43)
guaranteed location background like is (100:41 - 100:45)
the special surprise the guaranteed (100:43 - 100:46)
location background and they gave it all (100:45 - 100:49)
away in one sentence or was there like a (100:46 - 100:52)
a third thing here it seems like it was (100:49 - 100:55)
just the location card so full (100:52 - 100:57)
disclosure half my family went to this (100:55 - 101:00)
event I did not uh but they drove over (100:57 - 101:03)
to Seattle to go see the Mariners play (101:00 - 101:04)
is it because of the Pikachu or is it (101:03 - 101:06)
because of the (101:04 - 101:08)
Mariners because of the Pikachu I think (101:06 - 101:12)
my family plays Pokemon go nice and you (101:08 - 101:17)
didn&#39;t go I I was moving moving (101:12 - 101:20)
yeah that&#39;s important that&#39;s important (101:17 - 101:22)
if you weren&#39;t moving Hannah would you (101:20 - 101:24)
have gone to this (101:22 - 101:27)
probably not I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to be (101:24 - 101:29)
at a sports game until 1:00 (101:27 - 101:31)
a.m. that&#39;s true because you got to (101:29 - 101:33)
drive back after three hours away yeah (101:31 - 101:35)
that&#39;s tough that&#39;s (101:33 - 101:38)
tough um but my family went so I got (101:35 - 101:40)
pictures I got some descriptions I have (101:38 - 101:45)
some firsthand uh news on what happened (101:40 - 101:47)
there nice um I do think that it was (101:45 - 101:51)
mostly just the location card Pikachu (101:47 - 101:53)
which is neat and I&#39;m going to get one (101:51 - 101:55)
of those so so I&#39;m excited it was a (101:53 - 101:58)
Pikachu with the baseball field as the (101:55 - 102:00)
location card and it actually looks (101:58 - 102:02)
pretty neat there yeah and it has the (102:00 - 102:05)
Seattle Mariners logo on the field and (102:02 - 102:07)
all of that so you can tell exactly (102:05 - 102:10)
which game it was from I was told that (102:07 - 102:12)
the home team won which meant that The (102:10 - 102:15)
Vibes were really really good the whole (102:12 - 102:17)
time okay like they said for the event (102:15 - 102:19)
there was the fireworks thing afterwards (102:17 - 102:21)
that means that after the game everybody (102:19 - 102:24)
was still happy for that got (102:21 - 102:28)
it um I was told that there was a really (102:24 - 102:30)
long line to get the t-shirts but it was (102:28 - 102:32)
handled really quickly okay that there (102:30 - 102:34)
was somebody dressed up in a Pokeball (102:32 - 102:36)
costume that was making sure everybody (102:34 - 102:39)
was in the right place I did ask if it (102:36 - 102:41)
was a ball guy costume I sent a photo to (102:39 - 102:44)
make sure it was not it was just (102:41 - 102:48)
somebody wearing a giant (102:44 - 102:48)
Pokeball when you saw the photo is it (102:51 - 102:58)
like Pokemon pokeball or this person (102:55 - 102:59)
just kind of made it themselves kind of (102:58 - 103:02)
thing like official think uh not (102:59 - 103:06)
official like a Party City Halloween (103:02 - 103:09)
yeah spirit Spirit Halloween Pokeball (103:06 - 103:10)
Halloween costume are we sure this (103:09 - 103:12)
person was actually associated in any (103:10 - 103:14)
way with this or did they just show up (103:12 - 103:16)
in a Pokeball costume they were checking (103:14 - 103:18)
to make sure everybody had the right (103:16 - 103:21)
ticket to get the right shirt so I would (103:18 - 103:22)
do that too if I showed up in a Pokéball (103:21 - 103:25)
costume (103:22 - 103:25)
no guarantees but it sounds official got (103:26 - 103:31)
it uh I don&#39;t know if you can answer (103:29 - 103:34)
this question Hannah was there only one (103:31 - 103:36)
raid or were there multiple raids so a (103:34 - 103:39)
person could get multiple Pikachu I know (103:36 - 103:40)
that you could get multiple but I don&#39;t (103:39 - 103:43)
know how many oh okay but I know my (103:40 - 103:45)
family members got more than one okay (103:43 - 103:48)
okay okay so I I would assume that maybe (103:45 - 103:50)
they were popping like a Pikachu raid (103:48 - 103:51)
maybe at the start of every hour maybe (103:50 - 103:55)
once every hour yeah okay right so did (103:51 - 103:58)
any of your family members get a shiny (103:55 - 104:01)
Pikachu no I don&#39;t think so maybe they (103:58 - 104:03)
would have told me maybe the surprise (104:01 - 104:06)
was it was shiny boosted ah that was (104:03 - 104:08)
probably it because I do know some (104:06 - 104:10)
people got shinies okay which is going (104:08 - 104:13)
to be one of the rarest Shiny Pikachu (104:10 - 104:17)
out there seriously yeah (104:13 - 104:20)
yeah uh but yeah there it seems like it (104:17 - 104:22)
was a good event there were event there (104:20 - 104:24)
were uh items (104:22 - 104:26)
with the routes and all of that um it (104:24 - 104:28)
seemed like it was really good vibes (104:26 - 104:30)
everybody was kind of working together (104:28 - 104:33)
as you do at an in-person Pokemon event (104:30 - 104:37)
um and then during the special things (104:33 - 104:39)
they have during normal baseball games I (104:37 - 104:43)
guess like they had a thing where it&#39;s (104:39 - 104:45)
called hot dogs from heaven where they (104:43 - 104:47)
throw hot dogs with little parachutes (104:45 - 104:49)
into the crowd they had somebody in a (104:47 - 104:51)
Pikachu why am I not going to baseball (104:49 - 104:55)
games this sounds awesome never to said (104:51 - 104:57)
I&#39;ve grown up with seon tickets I never (104:55 - 104:59)
experienced hot dogs on par with (104:57 - 105:02)
parachutes I can get exclusive Pokemon (104:59 - 105:06)
and hot dogs raining from the sky for (105:02 - 105:06)
$42 subscription yeah especially because (105:07 - 105:12)
hot dogs at baseball stadiums are like (105:10 - 105:16)
$12 each so well apparently it was a (105:12 - 105:18)
Pikachu throwing the hot dogs from the (105:16 - 105:22)
sky so this sounds (105:18 - 105:25)
incredible so wait going back to the (105:22 - 105:27)
Pikachu I know we talk about like the (105:25 - 105:30)
Rarity of Pokemon and Pokemon go like (105:27 - 105:32)
like I don&#39;t think that black hat (105:30 - 105:34)
Pikachu is ever coming back that was (105:32 - 105:36)
like part of like fragment or whatever (105:34 - 105:37)
that like design collaboration you could (105:36 - 105:39)
maybe argue that the Luffy Pikachu from (105:37 - 105:42)
One Piece maybe probably not coming back (105:39 - 105:44)
MH although I think more likely to come (105:42 - 105:46)
back maybe than some other stuff (105:44 - 105:48)
especially if like I could see like the (105:46 - 105:50)
vinyl one piece or Whatever Whenever one (105:48 - 105:53)
piece is done like they could do years (105:50 - 105:56)
yeah in like another 50 years (105:53 - 106:03)
um do it&#39;s almost like is this Mariners (105:56 - 106:07)
Pikachu going to be like statistically (106:03 - 106:09)
is it more rare than black hat Pikachu (106:07 - 106:11)
because black hat Pikachu was at least (106:09 - 106:14)
worldwide yes this was I how many people (106:11 - 106:16)
go to a baseball game I don&#39;t actually (106:14 - 106:17)
know (106:16 - 106:20)
I I told that there were probably at (106:17 - 106:22)
least 300 people in the line for the (106:20 - 106:24)
T-shirt (106:22 - 106:25)
but as long as you&#39;re in the stadium you (106:24 - 106:29)
could have done the raid I think so yeah (106:25 - 106:30)
so I don&#39;t know how many people the (106:29 - 106:35)
Mariners Stadium could hold but um (106:30 - 106:37)
assuming because presumably not (106:35 - 106:40)
everybody yeah okay so T-Mobile Park is (106:37 - 106:43)
where the Mariners play baseball uh this (106:40 - 106:44)
Stadium holds (106:43 - 106:51)
47,9 29 people so if 20,000 people which (106:44 - 106:53)
I think is still really high 20,000 (106:51 - 106:57)
people did those raids that&#39;s not a (106:53 - 106:59)
worldwide event right so like does this (106:57 - 107:00)
make this (106:59 - 107:03)
Pikachu and assuming also that that (107:00 - 107:06)
location card doesn&#39;t come back like if (107:03 - 107:08)
they do you know night two because they (107:06 - 107:09)
said the first time ever they&#39;re doing (107:08 - 107:11)
this is the location card going to be (107:09 - 107:13)
different the next (107:11 - 107:16)
time yeah considering that blog post was (107:13 - 107:20)
by MLB and not specifically the team I (107:16 - 107:22)
could imagine this happening with (107:20 - 107:24)
multiple teams kind of going around for (107:22 - 107:29)
maybe a full baseball season well so (107:24 - 107:30)
okay so the way that the like the way (107:29 - 107:33)
that the websites work for these sport (107:30 - 107:36)
at least for like M MLB NBA NFL they&#39;re (107:33 - 107:39)
it&#39;s mlb.com but it&#39;s the Mariners (107:36 - 107:41)
specific MLB page so if you&#39;re actually (107:39 - 107:43)
looking at the page that has this (107:41 - 107:45)
announcement on it it&#39;s a Mariners (107:43 - 107:46)
specific page you can buy tickets for (107:45 - 107:48)
Mariners games it gives you the schedule (107:46 - 107:50)
for the Mariners yeah so it&#39;s like (107:48 - 107:53)
mariners.com basically it&#39;s like their (107:50 - 107:56)
specific MLB page that is talking about (107:53 - 107:59)
this event not the MLB maybe maybe it (107:56 - 108:02)
will become less rare over time if this (107:59 - 108:05)
keeps being a Mariners specific thing (108:02 - 108:07)
and I was wondering if because the (108:05 - 108:11)
Pokemon company has a headquarters in (108:07 - 108:13)
near Seattle that that&#39;s why this was (108:11 - 108:16)
happening with the with the Mariners (108:13 - 108:19)
specifically doesn&#39;t like Nintendo own (108:16 - 108:21)
part of the Mariners isn&#39;t that like (108:19 - 108:24)
part of the thing d they I wouldn&#39;t be (108:21 - 108:26)
surprised I do not know the answer to (108:24 - 108:28)
that (108:26 - 108:28)
one (108:30 - 108:34)
um that would be a that would be very (108:32 - 108:37)
interesting if uh Nintendo of America oh (108:34 - 108:39)
they sold the sells the majority of its (108:37 - 108:41)
interest in the Seattle Mariners to the (108:39 - 108:44)
current owner group they did at some (108:41 - 108:46)
point so I wonder if Nintendo still (108:44 - 108:49)
retains 10% ownership of the team there (108:46 - 108:53)
you go after the sale was completed in a (108:49 - 108:55)
August of 2026 I could be completely (108:53 - 108:59)
wrong wait was yes August of 2026 has (108:55 - 109:02)
not happened when s is 2016 sorry okay (108:59 - 109:05)
oh okay okay I was like Nintendo so (109:02 - 109:07)
Nintendo still owns 10% ownership of the (109:05 - 109:10)
team so I think that&#39;s probably part of (109:07 - 109:13)
it part of the reason why this is happen (109:10 - 109:16)
either way I think uh what a cool (109:13 - 109:17)
collaboration to (109:16 - 109:20)
get like the only time I&#39;ve ever gone to (109:17 - 109:22)
a baseball game I&#39;ve probably been to (109:20 - 109:25)
like maybe five baseball games in the 36 (109:22 - 109:28)
years I&#39;ve been on this Earth uh I think (109:25 - 109:29)
every time I&#39;ve gone it&#39;s just cuz I I (109:28 - 109:31)
got free tickets like somebody was like (109:29 - 109:32)
here&#39;s do you want tickets to the game (109:31 - 109:35)
and I&#39;m like sure and then I go and then (109:32 - 109:37)
I I have a pretty decent time for (109:35 - 109:39)
somebody who like doesn&#39;t watch (109:37 - 109:42)
sports uh and also like the hot dogs are (109:39 - 109:45)
always like good but like I don&#39;t think (109:42 - 109:46)
I&#39;ve ever stayed for a full baseball (109:45 - 109:48)
game but I I&#39;ve never regretted going (109:46 - 109:49)
with my free (109:48 - 109:52)
tickets um and just like it&#39;s something (109:49 - 109:53)
to do and it&#39;s (109:52 - 109:55)
it&#39;s stadiums are pretty (109:53 - 109:57)
cool like I think the other time you (109:55 - 109:58)
ever go to a stadium is like for a (109:57 - 110:00)
concert but like stadiums are they&#39;re (109:58 - 110:03)
like malls really like there&#39;s (110:00 - 110:08)
just yeah depends on depends on the yeah (110:03 - 110:09)
you&#39;re not wrong yeah I mean the (110:08 - 110:11)
atmosphere at a baseball game or or (110:09 - 110:13)
really any live sporting event is is (110:11 - 110:14)
pretty fun especially if you&#39;re going (110:13 - 110:18)
with people that you enjoy being with uh (110:14 - 110:21)
it makes it more fun obviously right um (110:18 - 110:23)
you know a lot of baseball games the (110:21 - 110:26)
baseball games I went to uh some of them (110:23 - 110:27)
were spent watching the game some of (110:26 - 110:29)
them were spent hanging out with friends (110:27 - 110:30)
and not really paying as much attention (110:29 - 110:33)
to the games uh as as just hanging out (110:30 - 110:36)
with friends and and stuff but uh it is (110:33 - 110:38)
definitely a fun time I think if you (110:36 - 110:40)
have the opportunity to go to a baseball (110:38 - 110:42)
game it can be a fun time and you don&#39;t (110:40 - 110:44)
some of them I mean at least here in San (110:42 - 110:47)
Diego like we have the stadium which is (110:44 - 110:48)
has all the seats and everything but you (110:47 - 110:51)
there&#39;s also an area of our stadium that (110:48 - 110:54)
is another Park it&#39;s a park within the (110:51 - 110:56)
baseball park and you can actually for (110:54 - 110:58)
like five bucks you can just get into (110:56 - 111:01)
that area still be at the baseball game (110:58 - 111:03)
still explore the stadium still go get (111:01 - 111:04)
food do all these things you just don&#39;t (111:03 - 111:06)
have a seat in the stadium you have this (111:04 - 111:09)
like area right outside basically it&#39;s (111:06 - 111:11)
right outside the Outfield where you can (111:09 - 111:13)
still watch the game um but you&#39;re like (111:11 - 111:16)
in the Outfield and there is this little (111:13 - 111:18)
like outdoor park that&#39;s right on the (111:16 - 111:20)
other side of it which is really nice so (111:18 - 111:22)
it&#39;s very cheap to be able to go you (111:20 - 111:24)
know five bucks and you can get in and (111:22 - 111:26)
you can watch a baseball game and it&#39;s (111:24 - 111:28)
not like a big um investment and you (111:26 - 111:30)
don&#39;t have to go sit with a bunch of (111:28 - 111:31)
like a giant crowd of people you can (111:30 - 111:33)
kind of just hang out but still watch (111:31 - 111:36)
the game which is fun (111:33 - 111:36)
nice uh speaking (111:37 - 111:44)
of competitions and gamings and I was (111:40 - 111:46)
trying to make a transition (111:44 - 111:48)
from it&#39;s a bad transition well it (111:46 - 111:50)
sounds like the the baseball thing is is (111:48 - 111:53)
good and if people if it s again it (111:50 - 111:55)
sounds like it&#39;s a good thing overall (111:53 - 111:57)
and you could end up with a very very (111:55 - 112:00)
rare Pikachu yeah that sounds great (111:57 - 112:03)
that&#39;s cool um I&#39;m gonna have to become (112:00 - 112:05)
friends with Hannah&#39;s family to also get (112:03 - 112:07)
a (112:05 - 112:07)
Pikachu uh this is off pokemon.com make (112:07 - 112:13)
friends and evolve your skills with (112:11 - 112:17)
local Pokemon go events in South Africa (112:13 - 112:19)
there&#39;s a couple regions in the world we (112:17 - 112:21)
talk about how like Korea&#39;s like always (112:19 - 112:23)
gets all like the Pokemon events there&#39;s (112:21 - 112:24)
a couple regions in the world that don&#39;t (112:23 - 112:28)
get any Pokemon events um but this is (112:24 - 112:30)
off pokemon.com players can participate (112:28 - 112:32)
in official Pokemon go events including (112:30 - 112:34)
League challenges and League cups (112:32 - 112:36)
players in South America can now take (112:34 - 112:40)
part in local play Pokemon retail South (112:36 - 112:43)
Africa South Africa what did I say South (112:40 - 112:45)
America oh my bad South am very (112:43 - 112:46)
different place a very different part of (112:45 - 112:49)
the world it&#39;s true I have that Brazil (112:46 - 112:51)
event on my mind right (112:49 - 112:56)
now uh uh the Pokemon trading card games (112:51 - 112:58)
game events already take place in these (112:56 - 113:00)
locations but Pokemon go events offer (112:58 - 113:02)
players opportunity to meet other (113:00 - 113:04)
members of the community develop skills (113:02 - 113:07)
win prizes Pokemon go League challenges (113:04 - 113:10)
are competitions held regularly at game (113:07 - 113:13)
stores that host play Pokemon events (113:10 - 113:15)
there a small entrylevel tournament on (113:13 - 113:17)
the local scale to provide a great way (113:15 - 113:18)
of understanding the fundamentals of (113:17 - 113:20)
Pokémon go while testing your skills (113:18 - 113:23)
against other Pokémon go players and so (113:20 - 113:26)
this is in conjunct conjunction with the (113:23 - 113:28)
launch of Pokémon go League activities (113:26 - 113:30)
in South Africa the top five players (113:28 - 113:32)
from the Middle East and South Africa (113:30 - 113:35)
region who have entered who have earned (113:32 - 113:37)
the most championship points will also (113:35 - 113:39)
now receive invitations to the Pokemon (113:37 - 113:42)
world championship so that&#39;s pretty big (113:39 - 113:45)
um and we have talked about on the show (113:42 - 113:46)
very quickly because I think that (113:45 - 113:49)
episode was running two hours long how (113:46 - 113:51)
they changed the point structure of the (113:49 - 113:53)
World Championships but there&#39;s saying (113:51 - 113:55)
top five players from South Africa and (113:53 - 113:59)
the Middle East will now get invites (113:55 - 114:01)
to this current well the season just (113:59 - 114:03)
started uh Baltimore regionals are (114:01 - 114:07)
happening as we record this but to the (114:03 - 114:10)
Anaheim World Championships I guess we (114:07 - 114:12)
don&#39;t have a whole lot of details here (114:10 - 114:15)
other than this but you know the Middle (114:12 - 114:19)
East and South Africa are (114:15 - 114:23)
not that close to each other and so I (114:19 - 114:26)
was wondering about that is it five each (114:23 - 114:28)
five from that total and then what (114:26 - 114:30)
happens to the part of Africa that&#39;s in (114:28 - 114:32)
between South Africa and the Middle East (114:30 - 114:34)
because there&#39;s a lot of it sounds like (114:32 - 114:36)
there just aren&#39;t any sanctioned events (114:34 - 114:38)
right they just get for that&#39;s it they (114:36 - 114:41)
just get that Egyptian furu that&#39;s allop (114:38 - 114:44)
Sig and sigth oh yeah and and we talked (114:41 - 114:46)
about this last week with Sig like (114:44 - 114:49)
Africa getting Sig and and tropus oh (114:46 - 114:50)
that&#39;s right they do get they also get (114:49 - 114:52)
tropus be happy with your version (114:50 - 114:53)
exclusive (114:52 - 114:59)
no absolutely not um yeah I don&#39;t know I (114:53 - 115:02)
don&#39;t know what it takes to expand to (114:59 - 115:04)
that (115:02 - 115:07)
um uh anytime we bring up the Middle (115:04 - 115:09)
East we always talk about like the one (115:07 - 115:10)
time there was supposed to be that (115:09 - 115:12)
Pokemon go event in the Middle East and (115:10 - 115:16)
then it got cancelled right um so n (115:12 - 115:19)
Antics at least tried um but I (115:16 - 115:21)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t know who oversees that (115:19 - 115:23)
like like I said earlier (115:21 - 115:25)
mhm you know there is a Korean specific (115:23 - 115:28)
rep there is an Indonesia specific rep (115:25 - 115:32)
obviously Japan is Japan and then (115:28 - 115:37)
um Europe is there is that European over (115:32 - 115:39)
overview but I I don&#39;t know who would be (115:37 - 115:43)
in charge of the Middle East or right (115:39 - 115:46)
Africa um and I do know Pokemon is (115:43 - 115:48)
trying to make an impact in South (115:46 - 115:51)
America we do have like a South America (115:48 - 115:53)
Internationals this time around (115:51 - 115:56)
yeah right I don&#39;t know where in Brazil (115:53 - 115:57)
that is I can&#39;t think of it off the top (115:56 - 116:00)
of my head but (115:57 - 116:02)
um I guess the takeaway is like this is (116:00 - 116:04)
a start they&#39;re taking five people at (116:02 - 116:06)
least from that region and giving them (116:04 - 116:09)
invites so maybe this is the start and (116:06 - 116:11)
then next year we come back around and (116:09 - 116:13)
we talk about how okay now they&#39;re doing (116:11 - 116:15)
10 and now there&#39;s more events in Egypt (116:13 - 116:18)
or KY or whatever else is over there (116:15 - 116:20)
that I can&#39;t think of off the top of my (116:18 - 116:21)
head because now I&#39;m very bad at (116:20 - 116:24)
geography um (116:21 - 116:27)
yeah I and it is you know this is the (116:24 - 116:29)
they this is they&#39;re talking about play (116:27 - 116:31)
Pokemon here right which is (116:29 - 116:34)
not Niantic I mean obviously it&#39;s (116:31 - 116:36)
Pokemon go so Niantic is involved in (116:34 - 116:38)
that way but like this is also talking (116:36 - 116:40)
about play Pokemon which is more (116:38 - 116:42)
associated with like the Pokemon company (116:40 - 116:44)
and obviously sending people to the (116:42 - 116:46)
World Championships is is more related (116:44 - 116:48)
to the Pokemon company as well so that (116:46 - 116:50)
is good to to see that it&#39;s it&#39;s not (116:48 - 116:53)
just you know not just dianic just not (116:50 - 116:55)
one company affiliated it&#39;s like the (116:53 - 116:58)
whole Pokemon company is going this (116:55 - 117:00)
route so maybe that does you know that (116:58 - 117:05)
is a a positive step in the in the right (117:00 - 117:05)
direction um to kind of keep on talking (117:05 - 117:10)
about competitive stuff there is the (117:08 - 117:14)
2025 Grand Challenge one online (117:10 - 117:17)
competition that also got announced uh (117:14 - 117:19)
the time has come for you to earn (117:17 - 117:21)
rewards and test your skills uh against (117:19 - 117:24)
trainers from the championship Point (117:21 - 117:26)
earning Regional regions in scarlet and (117:24 - 117:30)
violet uh we announced recently in (117:26 - 117:31)
addition to the global challenge events (117:30 - 117:33)
happening this season we are also (117:31 - 117:36)
introducing Grand Challenge events these (117:33 - 117:38)
events will uh function similarly to (117:36 - 117:41)
Global challenge but uh are limited to (117:38 - 117:43)
players in the championship Point (117:41 - 117:44)
earning (117:43 - 117:47)
regions you can sign up from September (117:44 - 117:49)
11th through September 19th competition (117:47 - 117:51)
will begin on September 19th and run (117:49 - 117:54)
until September second the competition (117:51 - 117:56)
is comprised of double battles using (117:54 - 117:58)
Pokemon appearing in scarlet and violet (117:56 - 118:01)
and the DLC the current twist they&#39;re (117:58 - 118:03)
saying it&#39;s a Twist uh legendary Pokemon (118:01 - 118:06)
and Paradox Pokemon may not be used and (118:03 - 118:07)
uh they are currently using the (118:06 - 118:11)
regulation H uh rule set small (118:07 - 118:13)
correction from last week I think I said (118:11 - 118:16)
regulation H last three months (118:13 - 118:18)
regulation H actually lasts four months (118:16 - 118:20)
so thank you to the YouTube comments for (118:18 - 118:23)
that all the sets prior have lasted 3 (118:20 - 118:26)
months but this one is lasting four (118:23 - 118:30)
um you can sign up uh you can earn (118:26 - 118:32)
Championship points if you&#39;ve linked (118:30 - 118:33)
your Nintendo account to your trainer (118:32 - 118:36)
Club account before you register for the (118:33 - 118:37)
online (118:36 - 118:41)
competition uh so if you are serious (118:37 - 118:42)
about this and you want to earn points (118:41 - 118:45)
make sure like if you&#39;ve already locked (118:42 - 118:47)
in and signed up and then afterwards (118:45 - 118:49)
you&#39;ve linked it that doesn&#39;t that (118:47 - 118:50)
doesn&#39;t count you have to have it linked (118:49 - 118:52)
before you submit your team and lock it (118:50 - 118:53)
in (118:52 - 118:56)
um now you might be listening to this (118:53 - 118:58)
podcast and not care about competitive (118:56 - 119:02)
at all uh but I I I would encourage you (118:58 - 119:05)
to not maybe skip these parts of the (119:02 - 119:07)
podcast in the future or at least keep (119:05 - 119:10)
your eyes on this because these events (119:07 - 119:13)
have usually led to those Shiny Pokemon (119:10 - 119:15)
that have happened in the past so that (119:13 - 119:18)
was like shiny zaptos shiny Articuno (119:15 - 119:21)
shiny molr from Galler uh were tied to (119:18 - 119:24)
these competitions (119:21 - 119:27)
or something like this competition uh (119:24 - 119:29)
and usually in the past you would just (119:27 - 119:31)
have to do three matches win or lose but (119:29 - 119:33)
you had to like properly register you (119:31 - 119:34)
had to get your team together even if (119:33 - 119:36)
your team was like L chunk small live (119:34 - 119:40)
charge a buug like you do have to (119:36 - 119:41)
participate but then you would get the (119:40 - 119:43)
shiny Pokemon once the competition (119:41 - 119:45)
finalized and finished and results were (119:43 - 119:48)
happen so very worthwhile oh yeah takes (119:45 - 119:49)
a little bit of effort if you&#39;re not (119:48 - 119:51)
used to signing up for the competitions (119:49 - 119:55)
but very worth while yeah so um if you (119:51 - 119:57)
have nothing to do and you&#39;re just (119:55 - 119:59)
curious about the process of this maybe (119:57 - 120:01)
just register sign up you don&#39;t have to (119:59 - 120:03)
really like do anything but it at least (120:01 - 120:06)
gets you in the mindset of like when and (120:03 - 120:08)
if they do like the (120:06 - 120:11)
shiny Rune Treasure of runes which might (120:08 - 120:16)
be maybe similar to the legendary birds (120:11 - 120:18)
I&#39;m not sure they do have good (120:16 - 120:20)
shinies they what they do have good (120:18 - 120:25)
shinies uh Chow has yeah wonderful shiny (120:20 - 120:28)
so good um so I&#39;m just saying keep your (120:25 - 120:32)
eyes on it because uh it was about (120:28 - 120:34)
December January February where they (120:32 - 120:38)
started doing the shiny Galler Birds um (120:34 - 120:40)
and I just remember all the people who (120:38 - 120:42)
are like I missed it I missed the sign (120:40 - 120:43)
up period because like once the (120:42 - 120:45)
competition starts you can no longer (120:43 - 120:49)
sign up so um no rewards this time (120:45 - 120:53)
around besides points if you care about (120:49 - 120:55)
points uh but I think there will be (120:53 - 120:57)
rewards in the future (120:55 - 121:00)
especially as we get (120:57 - 121:02)
to Anaheim (121:00 - 121:09)
worlds uh which is its own thing (121:02 - 121:13)
so um yeah I think I think that&#39;s all we (121:09 - 121:16)
have for news this (121:13 - 121:19)
week uh oh also for the you do get (121:16 - 121:21)
rewards if you do three or more matches (121:19 - 121:24)
you get a 100,000 leak points a gold (121:21 - 121:26)
bottle cap and an ability patch so there (121:24 - 121:28)
are some rewards even (121:26 - 121:31)
if um yeah you lose all three matches (121:28 - 121:33)
you still get a 100,000 leak points gold (121:31 - 121:37)
bottle capability patch it&#39;s it&#39;s better (121:33 - 121:39)
than nothing but yeah they not nothing (121:37 - 121:41)
they&#39;ve tied Pokemon to it they&#39;ve tied (121:39 - 121:43)
backpacks to it I remember the the the (121:41 - 121:46)
backpacks so yes yes the (121:43 - 121:51)
backpacks what a time what a time to be (121:46 - 121:54)
alive and believe regulation H ends (121:51 - 121:59)
January 5th and then we probably should (121:54 - 122:05)
get Paradox Legends back um and then if (121:59 - 122:08)
that&#39;s four months that takes us into (122:05 - 122:09)
what like (122:08 - 122:12)
April and then if the final that would (122:09 - 122:15)
be regulation I and then regulation (122:12 - 122:18)
J would be am I doing my alphabet right (122:15 - 122:21)
that would probably be two two box (122:18 - 122:23)
Legends (122:21 - 122:26)
than going into the world championship (122:23 - 122:29)
so yeah that makes sense and and when&#39;s (122:26 - 122:34)
that Legend Z release date just (122:29 - 122:34)
kidding well it is from Z to A so we&#39;re (122:35 - 122:43)
going backwards i h i j k oh no it&#39;s all (122:38 - 122:46)
making sense now I understand a is it&#39;s (122:43 - 122:48)
Regulation (122:46 - 122:51)
Z five years of we&#39;re not through the (122:48 - 122:54)
alphab yet (122:51 - 122:54)
Bobby um I&#39;m just going to say this in (122:56 - 123:01)
case I forget uh if you have not (122:59 - 123:03)
redeemed Leos (123:01 - 123:07)
spatio uh that ends on September 30th uh (123:03 - 123:09)
that&#39;s through like the mystery gift (123:07 - 123:11)
with Pokemon (123:09 - 123:13)
Horizons um so if you have not redeemed (123:11 - 123:18)
that now is you&#39;re running out of time (123:13 - 123:21)
uh the quackle is in November and then I (123:18 - 123:25)
think Roy F Coco is uh like January or (123:21 - 123:26)
something so you have plenty of time for (123:25 - 123:31)
that but spto is ending sooner so yeah (123:26 - 123:34)
that&#39;s I twist to this is that I (123:31 - 123:36)
actually have already redeemed them oh (123:34 - 123:38)
so usually I&#39;m the one that&#39;s redeeming (123:36 - 123:43)
it on September 29th but not this time I (123:38 - 123:46)
I did it early (123:43 - 123:49)
good uh all right that&#39;s our episode for (123:46 - 123:52)
you guys uh hopefully this episod (123:49 - 123:53)
episode was in a structure that made (123:52 - 123:55)
sense uh if you are listening early in (123:53 - 123:57)
the week like I said I will be streaming (123:55 - 123:59)
live in as long as everything is working (123:57 - 124:02)
Tech wise in Indonesia this upcoming (123:59 - 124:04)
weekend and then I will be streaming in (124:02 - 124:07)
South Korea the following weekend so if (124:04 - 124:10)
you&#39;re European I think those are very (124:07 - 124:12)
stream friendly times for you and if (124:10 - 124:15)
you&#39;re American and you&#39;re a night owl (124:12 - 124:17)
then that is also stream friendly times (124:15 - 124:18)
for you I suppose if you woke up at like (124:17 - 124:21)
6:00 a.m. for work I realistically (124:18 - 124:22)
should be live because I think that (124:21 - 124:24)
would would be like 6 p.m is for me so I (124:22 - 124:27)
don&#39;t know um you should come by you (124:24 - 124:29)
should you should see what Pokemon (124:27 - 124:31)
events are like in different regions (124:29 - 124:32)
because I think they&#39;re (124:31 - 124:35)

episode uh thank you Hannah thank you (124:35 - 124:40)
