episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:31 - 0:35)
super effective i'm your host sbj (0:32 - 0:38)
with me is greg (0:35 - 0:42)
hello friends it is good to see you (0:38 - 0:45)
i am on vacation (0:42 - 0:47)
for the holidays (0:45 - 0:50)
i've done exactly no shopping for any of (0:47 - 0:53)
my holiday requirements it's going to be (0:50 - 0:55)
exciting week (0:53 - 0:58)
of me fighting the crowds and variants (0:55 - 0:59)
to get (0:58 - 1:01)
i don't even know what i have to buy (0:59 - 1:03)
something for my niece and we usually (1:01 - 1:05)
put up lists she's put (1:03 - 1:06)
nothing (1:05 - 1:08)
on the list so (1:06 - 1:11)
i am just (1:08 - 1:11)
flying free (1:11 - 1:16)
i can do whatever i want handcrafted (1:14 - 1:17)
cocktails (1:16 - 1:19)
i mean (1:17 - 1:20)
wait how old is your niece i think she's (1:19 - 1:22)
old enough to drink now i think she's (1:20 - 1:24)
21. so yeah yeah yeah (1:22 - 1:28)
so my suggestion of a lol surprise doll (1:24 - 1:31)
would not be appropriate (1:28 - 1:33)
i don't know what kind of booze she even (1:31 - 1:35)
likes (1:33 - 1:37)
because it's not been a thing until this (1:35 - 1:39)
year because of course (1:37 - 1:41)
she's a very good person and would not (1:39 - 1:42)
drink underage (1:41 - 1:44)
speaking of good people will is here (1:42 - 1:46)
and i uh would like to take this (1:44 - 1:49)
opportunity um since this is our last (1:46 - 1:52)
recording before it occurs to hope that (1:49 - 1:56)
everyone can enjoy a restful time of uh (1:52 - 1:59)
peace and recovery at the end of our (1:56 - 2:02)
uh solar year (1:59 - 2:03)
right (2:02 - 2:05)
so we're gonna we're gonna turn the (2:03 - 2:07)
saltes solstice we're gonna get the (2:05 - 2:10)
longer days now yes (2:07 - 2:12)
as i did um (2:10 - 2:14)
message my work group this morning and (2:12 - 2:15)
say i don't think it's fair that i (2:14 - 2:17)
should have to start work before the (2:15 - 2:19)
sunrise it's the sun doesn't rise for 20 (2:17 - 2:21)
minutes i see you guys later in 20 (2:19 - 2:24)
minutes (2:21 - 2:24)
i forget how short the days actually get (2:24 - 2:28)
until we're here and it's like oh yeah (2:27 - 2:30)
it's dark at like two m in the afternoon (2:28 - 2:32)
it's not morning until 10. (2:30 - 2:34)
it's very short (2:32 - 2:37)
uh well we might have a very short show (2:34 - 2:39)
because there is not a lot of pokemon (2:37 - 2:42)
news this week there's a raid (2:39 - 2:45)
that would have come and gone (2:42 - 2:47)
i know the the deliberate raid is (2:45 - 2:49)
actually a little bit longer oh cool uh (2:47 - 2:51)
so we can talk about that um we didn't (2:49 - 2:54)
talk about voltorb last week (2:51 - 2:55)
uh (2:54 - 2:58)
because it wasn't officially on the us (2:55 - 3:01)
pokemon website which is not (2:58 - 3:02)
that doesn't like prevent us from (3:01 - 3:03)
talking about stuff because we've done (3:02 - 3:05)
that before but i just figured once it (3:03 - 3:06)
went up to u.s maybe there would be (3:05 - 3:09)
something more there wasn't it was fine (3:06 - 3:11)
we had enough to talk about last week (3:09 - 3:13)
anyways (3:11 - 3:14)
so (3:13 - 3:16)
i guess let's start there with our (3:14 - 3:18)
pokemon news let's start with uh there (3:16 - 3:22)
was a new trailer um and there was a the (3:18 - 3:25)
voltorb announcement so this was on (3:22 - 3:28)
december 10th so just a week ago we're (3:25 - 3:30)
actually recording this early (3:28 - 3:31)
we're recording this on friday afternoon (3:30 - 3:33)
we normally record on sunday but (3:31 - 3:36)
um the day is almost over so i doubt (3:33 - 3:38)
there will be pokemon news but you never (3:36 - 3:39)
know (3:38 - 3:43)
uh hissuin voltorb was shown (3:39 - 3:43)
with a wood grain like makeup of its (3:44 - 3:49)
body and surface and a hole on the top (3:46 - 3:51)
of its head it looks very similar to the (3:49 - 3:54)
pokeballs of the hisooi region these (3:51 - 3:56)
seem to be countless seeds packed and (3:54 - 3:58)
there seems to be countless seeds packed (3:56 - 4:01)
inside of his suing voltorb occasionally (3:58 - 4:02)
it will sprout these seeds out of the (4:01 - 4:04)
hole of its head however no one knows (4:02 - 4:06)
exactly what the inside of the pokemon (4:04 - 4:09)
body because uh because (4:06 - 4:10)
inside (4:09 - 4:12)
the pokemon body because inside the hole (4:10 - 4:14)
it is pitch dark (4:12 - 4:17)
it is the sphere pokemon it is electric (4:14 - 4:19)
grass (4:17 - 4:21)
uh before anyone says is this our first (4:19 - 4:24)
electric grass no rotometer (4:21 - 4:24)
noobs (4:25 - 4:28)
uh and i guess (4:29 - 4:32)
the interesting thing is there's a (4:33 - 4:37)
screenshot from the trailer where there (4:35 - 4:42)
are different sizes of these voltorb (4:37 - 4:42)
so i don't know if that's intentional or (4:43 - 4:48)
that was just like (4:45 - 4:49)
they they've they've clearly thought (4:48 - 4:52)
about size before in video games because (4:49 - 4:54)
in let's go pikachu let's go eevee it (4:52 - 4:57)
would be like it's tiny it's huge yeah (4:54 - 5:00)
that's this is not anything new they (4:57 - 5:02)
pokemon come in different sizes (5:00 - 5:03)
all of the (5:02 - 5:05)
uh um (5:03 - 5:07)
lantern the jacket the airline's calling (5:05 - 5:10)
me back are pumpkaboos pumpkins are (5:07 - 5:13)
different sizes i said that they've done (5:10 - 5:14)
that before (5:13 - 5:16)
with the one pokemon that i can't (5:14 - 5:18)
remember which was pumpkaboo pumpkaboo (5:16 - 5:22)
which we got there we got there together (5:18 - 5:22)
teamwork is dreamworks everybody it's (5:23 - 5:28)
evolution also has yes it's horseshit (5:25 - 5:29)
gorgeous (5:28 - 5:31)
gorgeous (5:29 - 5:34)
i know what it is is um (5:31 - 5:36)
that was like actually a bummer for (5:34 - 5:40)
let's go because it would have been cool (5:36 - 5:42)
if they were different sizes right they (5:40 - 5:44)
just said it in the description right (5:42 - 5:45)
they didn't actually like they weren't (5:44 - 5:46)
like (5:45 - 5:49)
no visual cue there wasn't visual cues (5:46 - 5:51)
they like have visual cues and go either (5:49 - 5:52)
you just look at the thing and it says (5:51 - 5:53)
xl and i'm like it doesn't look any (5:52 - 5:54)
bigger (5:53 - 5:56)
yeah yeah i know that's like a gimmick (5:54 - 5:58)
of pumpkaboo but it would be nice if my (5:56 - 6:00)
dragonite was like slightly taller or (5:58 - 6:02)
slightly shorter than an average sized (6:00 - 6:04)
dragonite can't well you can do that (6:02 - 6:06)
with copy it copy and paste you just set (6:04 - 6:07)
the ratios yeah yeah (6:06 - 6:08)
right (6:07 - 6:11)
we've learned from brilliant diamonds (6:08 - 6:13)
that the entire pokemon company very (6:11 - 6:16)
good at copy and pasting (6:13 - 6:16)
is (6:16 - 6:22)
so so if voltorb has the size variance i (6:18 - 6:25)
think that's cool i mean i'm into that i (6:22 - 6:27)
would like to see that apply to all (6:25 - 6:28)
pokemon although i understand that might (6:27 - 6:31)
be difficult (6:28 - 6:31)
but (6:31 - 6:34)
they they did so make them different (6:31 - 6:35)
sizes (6:34 - 6:37)
is that do we know for sure that that is (6:35 - 6:39)
actual gameplay or is that like cut (6:37 - 6:41)
scene movie yeah that was that was from (6:39 - 6:43)
game play that was not from movie okay (6:41 - 6:45)
because there was no um (6:43 - 6:48)
like claymation thing (6:45 - 6:49)
but (6:48 - 6:51)
still but it could have been a cut scene (6:49 - 6:53)
right do we know if it was cut scene (6:51 - 6:57)
from the game or it was actual gameplay (6:53 - 6:57)
footage is not final (6:58 - 7:02)
you see the female character surrounded (7:00 - 7:05)
by by multiple multiple evolve (7:02 - 7:08)
so i'm just curious if (7:05 - 7:09)
that was a cut scene and they're not (7:08 - 7:11)
really going to be different sizes in (7:09 - 7:13)
the real world or if it's going to be (7:11 - 7:14)
different size in the real world and (7:13 - 7:16)
that was like oh we just had this person (7:14 - 7:18)
have a party of six (7:16 - 7:20)
both hope to show off (7:18 - 7:22)
that they're all different sizes like (7:20 - 7:24)
i'm i don't i don't know what that is (7:22 - 7:26)
i feel like we don't know a lot about (7:24 - 7:29)
this game we don't know we don't i don't (7:26 - 7:31)
still have no clue what year this game (7:29 - 7:35)
is said well there's a two rival clans (7:31 - 7:35)
uh we will get there (7:35 - 7:39)
do we do we think that the voltorb is (7:37 - 7:41)
going to evolve into electrode because (7:39 - 7:43)
i'm gonna say (7:41 - 7:47)
no why not (7:43 - 7:47)
because it's just (7:48 - 7:54)
man-made that's why it's just electric (7:50 - 7:56)
no (7:54 - 7:56)
and then this seems to be or this is (7:57 - 8:01)
organic right that's where the grass (7:59 - 8:03)
comes from and the seeds and it's like (8:01 - 8:04)
made out of seeds (8:03 - 8:05)
but why (8:04 - 8:08)
but voltorb's not man-made it's not a (8:05 - 8:10)
man-made pokemon i think it is yeah it's (8:08 - 8:12)
like porygon i'm pretty sure it's (8:10 - 8:13)
man-made (8:12 - 8:15)
no (8:13 - 8:15)
i have i have the the (8:17 - 8:20)
the source of all knowledge open here in (8:19 - 8:24)
front of me here vol (8:20 - 8:27)
uh all right pokedex entries (8:24 - 8:30)
let's go here (8:27 - 8:32)
usually found in power plants is said to (8:30 - 8:35)
be camouflage itself as a pokeball (8:32 - 8:37)
usually found in power plants it rolls (8:35 - 8:40)
to move it was discovered when pokeballs (8:37 - 8:41)
were introduced it is said that there is (8:40 - 8:45)
some connection yeah it's not made (8:41 - 8:48)
well what if you make the pokeballs (8:45 - 8:51)
that that's that they said that there's (8:48 - 8:53)
there's a suspicion there's a connection (8:51 - 8:55)
i'm pretty sure man there's like a (8:53 - 8:57)
bulbapedia (8:55 - 9:01)
man made pokemon (8:57 - 9:02)
i think this is an article artificial (9:01 - 9:06)
pokemon bulbapedia (9:02 - 9:06)
voltorb and electrode first appeared (9:06 - 9:12)
in several pokedex entries at the (9:09 - 9:13)
company where modern pokeballs were (9:12 - 9:14)
developed it is rumored that it was (9:13 - 9:17)
first created when a pokeball was (9:14 - 9:20)
exposed to a pulse of energy (9:17 - 9:22)
the theory supported further by the fact (9:20 - 9:24)
that internal components are not a (9:22 - 9:26)
natural occurrence (9:24 - 9:28)
um (9:26 - 9:28)
i mean i would say that this (9:30 - 9:38)
new form throws a wrench into that yes (9:32 - 9:38)
so what's the question do you think it's (9:39 - 9:43)
not going to evolve into an electrode (9:40 - 9:46)
yeah i like how yeah mask evolves into (9:43 - 9:48)
roon regis and not oh you think it (9:46 - 9:50)
evolves into something that is not going (9:48 - 9:52)
to be his suit and voltor electro to be (9:50 - 9:54)
something completely yeah (9:52 - 9:57)
oh okay i thought you i thought you were (9:54 - 9:59)
saying it doesn't evolve (9:57 - 10:01)
and like it does (9:59 - 10:03)
make any sense no you're thinking more (10:01 - 10:05)
like a plant's gonna grow out the top of (10:03 - 10:07)
it or something like that (10:05 - 10:09)
i am yeah oh it's gonna be like a big (10:07 - 10:11)
it's me like because when i think of (10:09 - 10:14)
like oh uh when i think of the life or (10:11 - 10:17)
marowak or a lowland sandslash or (10:14 - 10:19)
lowland nine tails they look (10:17 - 10:21)
you know somewhat (10:19 - 10:23)
similar to their counterparts (10:21 - 10:25)
and when i'm looking at voltorb while (10:23 - 10:27)
voltorb does obviously look similar (10:25 - 10:29)
except it's made out of wood and there's (10:27 - 10:32)
seeds on the inside (10:29 - 10:34)
it would not be disappointing but it (10:32 - 10:37)
feels like this is the possibility of (10:34 - 10:39)
going into something new (10:37 - 10:43)
like yeah mask into rodriguez or (10:39 - 10:44)
there's another one i can't remember (10:43 - 10:48)
what the other one is but (10:44 - 10:48)
fatally jig dancy dude (10:49 - 10:54)
mr mime (10:52 - 10:54)
mr rhymed (10:55 - 10:58)
um fiddly dig (10:58 - 11:03)
i love the diddly dude that that is an (11:01 - 11:06)
excellent mr fezzy wig is what it is (11:03 - 11:09)
yes it's mr fuzzy wig the mime (11:06 - 11:11)
fun fact cast form was created by (11:09 - 11:12)
scientists this is on the man-made (11:11 - 11:14)
pokemon well we knew that because you go (11:12 - 11:16)
to the weather station and it's like hey (11:14 - 11:17)
we made this pokemon (11:16 - 11:20)
people paid attention to the dialogue in (11:17 - 11:22)
the hoenn games (11:20 - 11:24)
i did (11:22 - 11:25)
not everybody (11:24 - 11:28)
just skips over story like exactly hey i (11:25 - 11:33)
i hung on to every word and said in that (11:28 - 11:35)
fairest wheel (11:33 - 11:37)
once because you're on a date and you're (11:35 - 11:38)
hoping for something more out of that (11:37 - 11:39)
date (11:38 - 11:42)
as as we were watching you on twitch the (11:39 - 11:43)
other night (11:42 - 11:45)
and you mentioned something about (11:43 - 11:46)
story (11:45 - 11:48)
oh it was about buck (11:46 - 11:50)
and my husband said (11:48 - 11:52)
what is he even talking about he doesn't (11:50 - 11:54)
even pay attention to any story ever no (11:52 - 11:56)
i do pay attention i said don't yell at (11:54 - 11:57)
the tv (11:56 - 11:58)
we'll talk about that later the whole (11:57 - 12:00)
buck (11:58 - 12:02)
i haven't done the whole buck situation (12:00 - 12:03)
i remember buckingham hasn't changed in (12:02 - 12:06)
15 years and i don't i'm not i'm not (12:03 - 12:11)
mentally prepared for the new buck (12:06 - 12:11)
yeah i would say this is the chance for (12:11 - 12:16)
it to evolve into something different (12:14 - 12:17)
just like uh (12:16 - 12:20)
right suing growlithe could not evolve (12:17 - 12:21)
into arcanine and evolve into something (12:20 - 12:25)
different i would like it to i don't (12:21 - 12:26)
think (12:25 - 12:28)
they're going to do that i think it will (12:26 - 12:30)
evolve into (12:28 - 12:31)
an electrode (12:30 - 12:32)
of some sort (12:31 - 12:34)
i could see that just because then you (12:32 - 12:35)
would be like well this is what the (12:34 - 12:37)
electrode was based off of back in the (12:35 - 12:40)
day (12:37 - 12:40)
it's still weird that (12:41 - 12:45)
the timeline is getting real murky (12:45 - 12:50)
that's all i'm saying stop i'm not (12:48 - 12:54)
liking it stop looking for accuracy (12:50 - 12:54)
greg (12:55 - 12:58)
hoopa (12:56 - 13:00)
do not i'm not listening to your garbage (12:58 - 13:03)
explanation about hoopas anymore (13:00 - 13:06)
it is a it is a bad plot device it is (13:03 - 13:09)
always hoopa it's never hoopa (13:06 - 13:12)
there's there was a new trailer (13:09 - 13:15)
yes uh (13:12 - 13:15)
the jesui (13:15 - 13:19)
obviously you can't watch the trailer on (13:17 - 13:21)
a visual podcast so i will read you the (13:19 - 13:23)
notes here off the press release uh the (13:21 - 13:26)
hisui region has two clans the diamond (13:23 - 13:28)
clan and the pearl clan (13:26 - 13:30)
in addition to being home to the galaxy (13:28 - 13:32)
expedition team two other groups reside (13:30 - 13:35)
in the hazue region (13:32 - 13:36)
uh which are the diamond clan in the (13:35 - 13:38)
proclaim uh the people of the diamond (13:36 - 13:39)
clan (13:38 - 13:42)
often speak about the import importance (13:39 - 13:44)
of cherishing the present and living in (13:42 - 13:46)
the moment with one's allies on the (13:44 - 13:48)
other hand the pearl clan frequently (13:46 - 13:51)
advocates the importance of valuing vast (13:48 - 13:54)
spacious land shared with others (13:51 - 13:55)
although the diamond clan and the pearl (13:54 - 13:57)
clan may disagree on their beliefs they (13:55 - 14:00)
seem to never nevertheless share as many (13:57 - 14:02)
similarities both clans don clothing (14:00 - 14:04)
designing the resemblance of certain (14:02 - 14:06)
pokemon both pay respects to special (14:04 - 14:09)
pokemons they call lords and ladies or (14:06 - 14:11)
collectively noble pokemon (14:09 - 14:14)
moreover both clans have wardens who (14:11 - 14:17)
serve these special pokemon (14:14 - 14:19)
aida man serves as the leader of the (14:17 - 14:21)
diamond clan and his leafeon as his (14:19 - 14:24)
adamant pokemon admin (14:21 - 14:29)
because it's based off of what class (14:24 - 14:33)
i i don't know the adamant orb (14:29 - 14:33)
which is (14:33 - 14:39)
the special thing the special orb for (14:35 - 14:42)
dialga and you can see that he has the (14:39 - 14:43)
orb (14:42 - 14:47)
in around his neck (14:43 - 14:47)
oh the old mega stone gotta like wear it (14:47 - 14:52)
in something well it's not a mega stone (14:50 - 14:54)
it's probably the orb no no i i'm just (14:52 - 14:56)
saying that the gym haters always like (14:54 - 14:58)
wore the mega stones in like some like (14:56 - 15:01)
earring or necklace or staff or (14:58 - 15:02)
shoe (15:01 - 15:04)
i don't know where korean or wore hers i (15:02 - 15:06)
don't remember i don't know (15:04 - 15:08)
in one of the rollerblades or something (15:06 - 15:10)
uh (15:08 - 15:12)
this daring young man hates to see time (15:10 - 15:14)
go to waste and likes to rush forward (15:12 - 15:15)
without worrying too much about (15:14 - 15:17)
particulars (15:15 - 15:19)
uh irida urida (15:17 - 15:21)
air it up because it's based off of what (15:19 - 15:23)
class (15:21 - 15:27)
the irritated orb iridescent which is (15:23 - 15:29)
another word for lustrus (15:27 - 15:31)
which is the lustrous orb because they (15:29 - 15:34)
couldn't call a main character luster (15:31 - 15:36)
i mean they've called her lustra they (15:34 - 15:38)
could have called her lust (15:36 - 15:40)
no no that's already a character in full (15:38 - 15:42)
metal alchemist yeah (15:40 - 15:45)
so iridescent adira (15:42 - 15:46)
lustrous orb (15:45 - 15:49)
the one that is hold by pelican and she (15:46 - 15:52)
is also wearing the iridescent orb in (15:49 - 15:53)
her artwork (15:52 - 15:55)
uh she's the leader of the pearl clan (15:53 - 15:58)
her partner pokemon is glacion as a (15:55 - 16:00)
leader she feels it's important to uh (15:58 - 16:02)
have the courage to face the vast jesui (16:00 - 16:04)
region though she is suspicious when (16:02 - 16:05)
first meeting people she will close (16:04 - 16:07)
slowly come around to trust the player (16:05 - 16:10)
to help them as they provide in quelling (16:07 - 16:12)
the noble pokemon (16:10 - 16:14)
there's also a merchant (16:12 - 16:17)
a group of merchants knows as the ginkgo (16:14 - 16:18)
guild (16:17 - 16:20)
also operates in the hasuhi region not (16:18 - 16:23)
native to sui members of the ginkgo (16:20 - 16:24)
guild that travel around to various (16:23 - 16:27)
locations selling the wave the wares (16:24 - 16:29)
they have gathered somebody at game (16:27 - 16:30)
freak must have played (16:29 - 16:32)
skyrim recently (16:30 - 16:34)
to have like hey we need a traveling (16:32 - 16:35)
merchant as well (16:34 - 16:37)
i mean traveling merchants are part of (16:35 - 16:40)
all semi-open world games yep (16:37 - 16:42)
add the mythical pokemon dar cry to your (16:40 - 16:45)
team players with play records from (16:42 - 16:47)
brilliant diamond or shining pearl games (16:45 - 16:48)
will be able to take on the research (16:47 - 16:51)
request in pokemon legends arceus that (16:48 - 16:52)
will lead to an encounter with the (16:51 - 16:55)
mythical pokemon darkrai they will also (16:52 - 16:56)
be able to claim the modern team (16:55 - 17:00)
galactic set which is just an outfit (16:56 - 17:00)
and yeah that is it uh it seems we're (17:00 - 17:06)
not talking about the most important (17:04 - 17:09)
part i just read the press release about (17:06 - 17:12)
that entire trailer hit me with it i (17:09 - 17:13)
don't know what greg thinks it might be (17:12 - 17:16)
different i think that instead of saying (17:13 - 17:19)
arceus they pray to the almighty sinnoh (17:16 - 17:21)
greg you and i think the same exact (17:19 - 17:24)
thing i i was like what's that [ __ ] (17:21 - 17:25)
what is that (17:24 - 17:28)
what is going on almighty sinnoh that's (17:25 - 17:31)
the reason i was playing (17:28 - 17:34)
pokemon what what is what is the (17:31 - 17:37)
solution behind that wild statement (17:34 - 17:39)
friends (17:37 - 17:41)
is this just going to be like dialga and (17:39 - 17:44)
palkiel merging together (17:41 - 17:46)
no no (17:44 - 17:49)
that's that that's sakuram and resharam (17:46 - 17:52)
and hear them and cure them that's their (17:49 - 17:55)
deal that's their deal like (17:52 - 17:57)
are they going to come here (17:55 - 17:59)
oh my gosh (17:57 - 18:01)
what do you have a theory about this (17:59 - 18:04)
almighty sinnoh so (18:01 - 18:05)
my (18:04 - 18:06)
so (18:05 - 18:07)
um (18:06 - 18:10)
there's like an overarching (18:07 - 18:13)
alternate universe theory (18:10 - 18:16)
that okay hoopa (18:13 - 18:17)
no no (18:16 - 18:18)
that (18:17 - 18:20)
team galactic (18:18 - 18:23)
did create their other world (18:20 - 18:24)
uh and this is the other world that they (18:23 - 18:26)
created (18:24 - 18:29)
uh and so it's got the mixture of that (18:26 - 18:31)
all the time is mixed up and (18:29 - 18:34)
uh the way to get out of it would be (18:31 - 18:37)
uh getting a hold of giritina and arceus (18:34 - 18:39)
to undo this universe and set things (18:37 - 18:40)
back right which is why they don't know (18:39 - 18:43)
about arceus and said they know they (18:40 - 18:44)
call it sinnoh because the that's the (18:43 - 18:46)
region that they came from and they (18:44 - 18:49)
believe that is the (18:46 - 18:51)
powerful pokemon in charge and they are (18:49 - 18:52)
wrong (18:51 - 18:54)
interesting (18:52 - 18:56)
where did you find that one (18:54 - 18:58)
on reddit (18:56 - 19:00)
it's it's in my brain because i sit here (18:58 - 19:02)
and ponder how could everything be so (19:00 - 19:05)
weird and disjointed how could they have (19:02 - 19:07)
a cell phone how could they have a cell (19:05 - 19:09)
phone and yet i'm still (19:07 - 19:11)
car whittling pokeballs that come to (19:09 - 19:12)
life (19:11 - 19:14)
yeah because all i was thinking was that (19:12 - 19:17)
they just like misnamed arceus and named (19:14 - 19:19)
it sinnoh (19:17 - 19:19)
that's what i know (19:20 - 19:25)
i have never seen the internet be so (19:22 - 19:26)
happy (19:25 - 19:28)
about just two character designs (19:26 - 19:30)
it actually kind of reminded me of uh (19:28 - 19:32)
when like they showed marnie and nessa (19:30 - 19:34)
people were pretty happy but i felt like (19:32 - 19:35)
people were really happy about these (19:34 - 19:39)
designs they're very good designs (19:35 - 19:41)
i mean they're very interesting and (19:39 - 19:43)
unique designs that give that give a (19:41 - 19:47)
very strong strong feel to them like (19:43 - 19:48)
when you look at them (19:47 - 19:50)
you can get their personalities really (19:48 - 19:53)
well that's like uh (19:50 - 19:55)
this is the sign of a well-designed (19:53 - 19:58)
character right (19:55 - 19:58)
and they sort of fit with (19:58 - 20:04)
their theming a little bit you know like (20:02 - 20:07)
you can kind of see the um (20:04 - 20:09)
pelcia and the all good designs in their (20:07 - 20:10)
clothing (20:09 - 20:14)
like they're very evocative (20:10 - 20:14)
they're really good and they're both (20:14 - 20:17)
they feel like (20:15 - 20:21)
they feel interesting (20:17 - 20:23)
characters like without having really (20:21 - 20:27)
said much they just feel very intriguing (20:23 - 20:27)
i mean i found them to be (20:30 - 20:34)
rather unremarkable but i don't go on (20:32 - 20:35)
the internet to find other people's (20:34 - 20:38)
opinions (20:35 - 20:39)
hey look when there's a positive opinion (20:38 - 20:41)
there's a positive opinion (20:39 - 20:43)
uh also just a side note here the modern (20:41 - 20:45)
team galactic set which includes the (20:43 - 20:46)
modern jacket monitored trousers modern (20:45 - 20:48)
shoes (20:46 - 20:49)
for whatever reason just i want to point (20:48 - 20:51)
that out that can seems to confirm that (20:49 - 20:53)
you'll be able to change those three (20:51 - 20:54)
things (20:53 - 20:56)
um so that's good (20:54 - 20:58)
uh unlike diamond pro where it's all or (20:56 - 20:59)
nothing (20:58 - 21:00)
just you know uh you know let's go (20:59 - 21:03)
pikachu also had the ability to change (21:00 - 21:04)
different things i just want to put that (21:03 - 21:06)
out there too you know (21:04 - 21:08)
copy and paste uh players will be able (21:06 - 21:11)
to claim the bonuses uh when they launch (21:08 - 21:12)
the game with user play records from (21:11 - 21:14)
brilliant diamond shining pro the (21:12 - 21:16)
request allows players to encounter (21:14 - 21:19)
darkrai which they can accept that quest (21:16 - 21:21)
in jubalife city after viewing the (21:19 - 21:23)
game's end credits (21:21 - 21:24)
players can claim the modern team (21:23 - 21:27)
galactic set by speaking to the clother (21:24 - 21:29)
after joining the galaxy expedition team (21:27 - 21:31)
it takes about one hour of play time to (21:29 - 21:34)
reach that point in the game (21:31 - 21:35)
also i'll point out another thing about (21:34 - 21:37)
adamant indira (21:35 - 21:39)
he's adamant as a young man that he's (21:37 - 21:43)
seen that hates to see time go to waste (21:39 - 21:47)
nadira wants her space (21:43 - 21:47)
you know they match up with their (21:48 - 21:53)
it is still (21:51 - 21:55)
weird to me (21:53 - 21:56)
that we don't know what year this is set (21:55 - 21:59)
in absolutely yes it is still weird to (21:56 - 22:00)
me that there's not two versions of this (21:59 - 22:03)
game (22:00 - 22:03)
this is the platinum dude this is the (22:03 - 22:07)
place yeah this is this is the platinum (22:05 - 22:08)
remake (22:07 - 22:12)
this company has been milking us for 25 (22:08 - 22:13)
years (22:12 - 22:16)
ultra sun ultra moon was probably the (22:13 - 22:18)
biggest milk job they needed a whole (22:16 - 22:21)
truck of milk for this one (22:18 - 22:22)
they could have just done the platinum (22:21 - 22:24)
or the crystal or the emerald but they (22:22 - 22:26)
were like nah two games the only (22:24 - 22:29)
difference one has blacephalon one has (22:26 - 22:32)
stockataka pay up and you're like well (22:29 - 22:35)
i'm a sucker so yep here we go (22:32 - 22:36)
it's weird to me that there's just not (22:35 - 22:39)
two games i expect to be scammed by this (22:36 - 22:41)
company i'm ready to give them sixty (22:39 - 22:44)
dollars twice and then be upset about it (22:41 - 22:46)
yeah but maybe they don't want to do (22:44 - 22:49)
that yeah exactly but why (22:46 - 22:51)
they they would be able to put like hey (22:49 - 22:52)
they're worried (22:51 - 22:54)
there weren't two versions of pokemon (22:52 - 22:56)
snap right (22:54 - 22:58)
there's only one snap but also there's (22:56 - 22:58)
no (22:58 - 23:00)
there's no (22:58 - 23:01)
competition in this right like there's (23:00 - 23:03)
no competitive (23:01 - 23:05)
that's true but there's only there's (23:03 - 23:07)
there's only trading there's only (23:05 - 23:08)
trading yes they already said there's no (23:07 - 23:10)
multiplayer there's no like (23:08 - 23:12)
walking the overworld with somebody else (23:10 - 23:16)
i'm but in my head i'm thinking like (23:12 - 23:18)
ruby and sapphire (23:16 - 23:22)
in ruby you deal with the team magma (23:18 - 23:24)
storyline sapphire (23:22 - 23:26)
deal with the team magma they could have (23:24 - 23:26)
put (23:26 - 23:29)
hot guy number one (23:26 - 23:31)
on one cover and then hot girl number (23:29 - 23:34)
two on the other like that and yeah i (23:31 - 23:35)
mean (23:34 - 23:37)
they maybe just (23:35 - 23:39)
didn't have that type of story in mind (23:37 - 23:41)
yeah exactly we we don't know what (23:39 - 23:44)
what the story of the game is right (23:41 - 23:46)
that's true we have no clue (23:44 - 23:47)
what's going on or why we're in this (23:46 - 23:49)
region or what's happening (23:47 - 23:52)
and (23:49 - 23:53)
i'm not going to say this is a sign that (23:52 - 23:55)
they'll never make two versions but i (23:53 - 23:57)
think it's a sign that they at least (23:55 - 24:00)
acknowledge that (23:57 - 24:02)
for certain games yeah they could maybe (24:00 - 24:05)
make two but they just want one (24:02 - 24:07)
universal experience for everybody to (24:05 - 24:08)
have (24:07 - 24:11)
like i imagine this spells (24:08 - 24:14)
doom for having a large pokedex right (24:11 - 24:15)
like it's not going to be a ton of (24:14 - 24:17)
pokemon (24:15 - 24:19)
because one of the things is you have a (24:17 - 24:21)
ton of unique so people are encouraged (24:19 - 24:25)
to trade i mean i just don't think (24:21 - 24:25)
that i mean that like i (24:25 - 24:29)
beside like each (24:27 - 24:31)
pokemon game has exclusives (24:29 - 24:33)
you know back in red and one head growl (24:31 - 24:35)
with one head vulpix right so you can (24:33 - 24:36)
always (24:35 - 24:38)
turn a pokemon game into two by cutting (24:36 - 24:40)
the pokedex (24:38 - 24:41)
yes (24:40 - 24:42)
yeah i just think this pokedex is (24:41 - 24:44)
probably very small (24:42 - 24:45)
yeah maybe it's just when they showed (24:44 - 24:48)
these characters it felt like oh it felt (24:45 - 24:50)
like the team magma team aqua like you (24:48 - 24:53)
now have another reason to cut the game (24:50 - 24:54)
because (24:53 - 24:56)
also have they (24:54 - 24:58)
even said that there's trading (24:56 - 25:00)
yeah they did yes they did they said (24:58 - 25:01)
they specifically said there's no (25:00 - 25:04)
battling the only multiplayer (25:01 - 25:07)
communication is trading okay (25:04 - 25:09)
i didn't get i i didn't get that this (25:07 - 25:12)
was two (25:09 - 25:12)
clans that were at odds like yeah or (25:12 - 25:19)
has a similar somewhat overlapping but (25:16 - 25:21)
different ends they have different (25:19 - 25:23)
police but they are doing the same thing (25:21 - 25:25)
on the island they have wardens that are (25:23 - 25:27)
protecting certain pokemon i didn't get (25:25 - 25:30)
a conflict vibe this seemed like a a far (25:27 - 25:32)
cry thing to me though like (25:30 - 25:34)
if you in far cry they always have near (25:32 - 25:36)
the beginning of the game of like here (25:34 - 25:38)
are three clans pick which one you want (25:36 - 25:40)
to join and it changes your story (25:38 - 25:41)
slightly and then it adds replay value (25:40 - 25:43)
if you want to start again well but we (25:41 - 25:45)
are in a clan it's called the galactic (25:43 - 25:49)
research exposition (25:45 - 25:49)
i don't think we get to join these two (25:50 - 25:54)
clans (25:51 - 25:55)
i think we'd interact with them on (25:54 - 25:57)
behalf of team galactic who's trying to (25:55 - 25:59)
keep their universe together why are you (25:57 - 26:00)
trying to encourage them to make two (25:59 - 26:02)
games so that we have to spend more (26:00 - 26:04)
money (26:02 - 26:05)
loudly (26:04 - 26:05)
don't (26:05 - 26:08)
to to quote you can't do that on (26:05 - 26:09)
television (26:08 - 26:12)
don't encourage them yeah (26:09 - 26:15)
wow that show is good (26:12 - 26:15)
i'm happy there's only one game i mean i (26:18 - 26:22)
am i am happy there's only one game too (26:20 - 26:25)
i feel like a bunch of like let's go (26:22 - 26:27)
eevee let's go pikachu though the (26:25 - 26:29)
because it was also a small pokedex it (26:27 - 26:32)
felt really weird to have it split (26:29 - 26:34)
like there wasn't a lot of reason to (26:32 - 26:37)
split that game in half right well like (26:34 - 26:39)
there's not a lot of reason to split (26:37 - 26:42)
mystery dungeon in half so i i'm happy (26:39 - 26:44)
that they're just like you know what we (26:42 - 26:46)
don't have a strong formula to split (26:44 - 26:48)
this game in half (26:46 - 26:50)
look i'm not defending saying they need (26:48 - 26:51)
to speak you are you're just like this (26:50 - 26:54)
show i just i just think it's based on (26:51 - 26:57)
their past behavior it's weird oh so now (26:54 - 26:58)
you're into patterns (26:57 - 27:00)
no no no (26:58 - 27:03)
in gold and silver and diamond and pearl (27:00 - 27:06)
there was no reas like your bad guy (27:03 - 27:08)
story line (27:06 - 27:09)
was the same (27:08 - 27:12)
and ruby and sapphire that's one thing (27:09 - 27:14)
they did differently of like at least it (27:12 - 27:16)
like oh i want to see what t-mobile does (27:14 - 27:16)
i mean (27:16 - 27:19)
spoiler it's real it's like the same (27:16 - 27:21)
it's roughly the same (27:19 - 27:22)
it's pretty much the same they (27:21 - 27:24)
they they have the same goals just (27:22 - 27:26)
different elements right it's like one (27:24 - 27:28)
is land one is water so when i saw these (27:26 - 27:30)
two characters i was like oh i mean (27:28 - 27:32)
they're not bad guys but it seems like (27:30 - 27:34)
hey i have this is what i'm doing in the (27:32 - 27:36)
world versus what she's like this is (27:34 - 27:38)
what i'm doing in the world but (27:36 - 27:41)
it's whatever i i just don't think that (27:38 - 27:43)
i just don't think (27:41 - 27:45)
i think this is telling us that the (27:43 - 27:47)
their plot line isn't thick enough to (27:45 - 27:49)
deserve it being split like there's just (27:47 - 27:52)
not gonna be a lot there (27:49 - 27:54)
i am so curious what this game is gonna (27:52 - 27:56)
look like i (27:54 - 27:57)
every time they release something i'm (27:56 - 27:58)
like (27:57 - 28:02)
this game gets more and more confusing (27:58 - 28:04)
which is doing (28:02 - 28:07)
a good job of actually keeping my hype (28:04 - 28:08)
down because every time i see it i'm (28:07 - 28:12)
like this game feels like a hot mess no (28:08 - 28:14)
no i'm the opposite i'm like i'm ready (28:12 - 28:16)
to find out all this mystery i'm (28:14 - 28:18)
actually i'm thankful for it i'm (28:16 - 28:20)
excited to see what the mystery is but (28:18 - 28:23)
my hype is is in control because i think (28:20 - 28:26)
this could easily just be a hot mess (28:23 - 28:29)
yeah i this this is what i think as well (28:26 - 28:31)
i think this is either going to be (28:29 - 28:33)
incredibly refreshing and a great (28:31 - 28:36)
experience or it's just going to be bad (28:33 - 28:40)
or a hot hot mess like it's it's (28:36 - 28:43)
i know i know some people (28:40 - 28:46)
love the mystery dungeon series yep (28:43 - 28:49)
like i and i'm no discredit to you i get (28:46 - 28:51)
why you like it i understand but when i (28:49 - 28:54)
go to mystery dungeon and i like okay (28:51 - 28:55)
i'm gonna get into it i've done this (28:54 - 28:57)
like four times and people are always (28:55 - 28:59)
like well not that game you have to do (28:57 - 29:01)
this game no not that i get it (28:59 - 29:03)
i'm like clear mind (29:01 - 29:06)
good expectations i go in and then it's (29:03 - 29:09)
just the actual playing mystery dungeon (29:06 - 29:12)
is not enjoyable to me it just doesn't (29:09 - 29:14)
feel fun (29:12 - 29:16)
but i like the theme like i like that (29:14 - 29:18)
the pokemon talk i like that it's (29:16 - 29:20)
pokemon i like the like adding to the (29:18 - 29:21)
team and (29:20 - 29:24)
i like the concept of that (29:21 - 29:26)
and that's what i'm worried about here (29:24 - 29:28)
is like yeah this looks great you're (29:26 - 29:29)
walking around in this world you can (29:28 - 29:31)
walk up to pokemon you got little wooden (29:29 - 29:33)
pokeballs (29:31 - 29:34)
conceptually (29:33 - 29:36)
seems like what everyone would want (29:34 - 29:39)
i just i'm worried that like (29:36 - 29:43)
oh gameplay-wise this is not fun (29:39 - 29:45)
i mean it could it could be (29:43 - 29:49)
i have no clue no clue um and (29:45 - 29:52)
in at least also i think what we can (29:49 - 29:54)
take away from (29:52 - 29:56)
it not being two games is they also (29:54 - 29:58)
wanted to focus on on it (29:56 - 30:00)
very specifically without sort of having (29:58 - 30:01)
to be like (30:00 - 30:04)
okay let's also add a layer of dividing (30:01 - 30:06)
things out to make it worthwhile having (30:04 - 30:08)
two games or splitting your story up or (30:06 - 30:09)
trying to (30:08 - 30:10)
develop (30:09 - 30:12)
you know diamond versus pearl storyline (30:10 - 30:15)
i feel like they knew (30:12 - 30:17)
hopeful fingers crossed what they wanted (30:15 - 30:20)
to tell with the story of this game and (30:17 - 30:23)
they just said let's just make this game (30:20 - 30:25)
one version of it the best we can make (30:23 - 30:27)
it and i'm i i have hope that that's (30:25 - 30:29)
what's happening with this game (30:27 - 30:32)
because everything they keep introducing (30:29 - 30:33)
just (30:32 - 30:35)
weirds me out and i'm like i can't get (30:33 - 30:38)
too excited because i'm worried that (30:35 - 30:40)
they just throw a bunch of spaghetti at (30:38 - 30:43)
the wall and again if they needed more (30:40 - 30:45)
time (30:43 - 30:47)
why why is this game so close to diamond (30:45 - 30:48)
pearl (30:47 - 30:50)
well we now know having played diamond (30:48 - 30:51)
in pearl (30:50 - 30:53)
different companies though different (30:51 - 30:55)
companies (30:53 - 30:56)
sure but (30:55 - 30:58)
they could have definitely gotten away (30:56 - 31:00)
with (30:58 - 31:02)
there's there's not a doubt in my mind (31:00 - 31:03)
there's no there's not something for (31:02 - 31:05)
next fall they're not february i don't (31:03 - 31:07)
know what it is though february is not (31:05 - 31:09)
going to show up and they're going to be (31:07 - 31:11)
like we got nothing for the year there's (31:09 - 31:14)
no way they're going to do that we have (31:11 - 31:15)
because (31:14 - 31:17)
people that don't know end of february (31:15 - 31:18)
is like pokemon day where they (31:17 - 31:22)
usually 27th isn't it yeah (31:18 - 31:22)
i there's no way they just un like (31:28 - 31:32)
there's no way arceus comes out and then (31:31 - 31:34)
a month later they're like we got (31:32 - 31:37)
nothing for the year maybe they could (31:34 - 31:39)
maybe the something is like hey here's (31:37 - 31:42)
the 20 platinum dlc we added (31:39 - 31:45)
two buttons on your poke catch (31:42 - 31:49)
that doesn't work for some people at all (31:45 - 31:49)
uh yeah i i am still not in the gen 9 is (31:49 - 31:56)
coming out next year for fall as a lot (31:54 - 31:58)
of people are like oh we're getting gen (31:56 - 32:01)
nine next year (31:58 - 32:03)
it'll be something else (32:01 - 32:05)
i think (32:03 - 32:07)
pokemon shuffle on switch (32:05 - 32:09)
um yeah i haven't (32:07 - 32:11)
i don't know where they are in journeys (32:09 - 32:13)
but that doesn't seem like they're going (32:11 - 32:15)
to be able to wrap up this year (32:13 - 32:17)
no (32:15 - 32:17)
maybe i don't know i have i i i just (32:18 - 32:24)
don't i i think something (32:22 - 32:27)
something else surprising most likely (32:24 - 32:31)
kanto related is coming out next year (32:27 - 32:31)
the the thing that the realistic thing i (32:33 - 32:36)
think is like (32:35 - 32:39)
this game gets dlc and (32:36 - 32:41)
diamond pro get dlc and that's our year (32:39 - 32:43)
i feel like that's true yes and there (32:41 - 32:46)
may be another sword and shield dlc (32:43 - 32:49)
i don't know about that but well well (32:46 - 32:50)
maybe (32:49 - 32:51)
their competitive is still there they (32:50 - 32:55)
have these new forms coming in (32:51 - 32:55)
there may be a change to sword and (32:55 - 32:59)
shield since competitive is staying (32:57 - 33:01)
there that with these two games coming (32:59 - 33:03)
out they're going to add something to (33:01 - 33:05)
sword and shield to bring them in (33:03 - 33:08)
and maybe do a little bit more with this (33:05 - 33:08)
like i (33:08 - 33:10)
i i have a feeling they will do (33:08 - 33:11)
something to sword and shield to (33:10 - 33:13)
compensate for these two games (33:11 - 33:16)
particularly arses with new forms (33:13 - 33:17)
uh well speaking of sword shield there (33:16 - 33:19)
is a raid event this weekend but we're (33:17 - 33:21)
going to take a quick break (33:19 - 33:22)
when we come back we will talk about (33:21 - 33:25)
that and the rest of the news so we will (33:22 - 33:27)
be right back (33:25 - 33:31)
and we are back (33:27 - 33:31)
then from our break there's some sword (33:32 - 33:35)
and shield news here celebrate the (33:34 - 33:37)
season in pokemon sword and shield you (33:35 - 33:40)

some would say it's the year of (33:52 - 33:54)
triagonal (33:53 - 33:56)
more frequently in raid dens very rarely (33:54 - 33:58)
during the event you may find a shiny (33:56 - 34:00)
deli bird (33:58 - 34:01)
for an opportunity to encounter these (34:00 - 34:03)
you'll need to connect your nintendo (34:01 - 34:05)
switch to the internet through the y-com (34:03 - 34:08)
by selecting mystery gift in the x menu (34:05 - 34:11)
and then going to get wild area news (34:08 - 34:13)

which (39:34 - 39:38)
they've done a pogo event at the taiwan (39:36 - 39:40)
lantern festival before (39:38 - 39:42)

monterey (39:45 - 39:47)
nice (39:46 - 39:51)

see we practiced last night on our (39:51 - 39:56)
twitch streams monterey (39:53 - 39:58)
mexico at the (39:56 - 39:59)
park (39:58 - 40:02)
parque (39:59 - 40:04)
funny dora (40:02 - 40:06)

wait what's the ah (40:20 - 40:24)
of course i don't know where monterey (40:22 - 40:26)
mexico actually is i think it's on the (40:24 - 40:28)
west coast (40:26 - 40:30)
like what are we talking about on the (40:28 - 40:32)
pacific coast oh it's going to be (40:30 - 40:34)
expensive (40:32 - 40:34)
yeah (40:34 - 40:36)
i would assume anytime you leave the (40:34 - 40:38)
country it's expensive it's going to be (40:36 - 40:39)
expensive (40:38 - 40:43)
where i'm pulling way out uh it is on (40:39 - 40:46)
it's more east oh is it not on the west (40:43 - 40:49)

normally go in mexico cancun all over (40:49 - 40:53)
wonderful country (40:51 - 40:56)
uh city is amazing (40:53 - 41:00)
it's pretty close to the border of texas (40:56 - 41:00)
[Music] (41:00 - 41:04)

what are you talking about not that (41:04 - 41:07)
close (41:05 - 41:11)
it's probably like a two-hour drive (41:07 - 41:11)
so we could fly to brownsville and drive (41:15 - 41:19)
to monitor i don't have a passport i (41:17 - 41:21)

real life photo opportunities lounge (42:40 - 42:45)
areas exclusive merchandise at select (42:42 - 42:48)
locations (42:45 - 42:48)
it is um (42:50 - 42:54)
cool (42:52 - 42:56)
that they've picked some new locations (42:54 - 42:58)
here i think taiwan is the only location (42:56 - 43:00)
that is not new (42:58 - 43:02)
although since they keep going back it (43:00 - 43:04)
must be very successful for them to do (43:02 - 43:06)
that there (43:04 - 43:06)
i've heard there was concerns with some (43:10 - 43:16)
stuff with the uh abu dhabi but i don't (43:13 - 43:19)
know too much about that (43:16 - 43:21)
what's what what (43:19 - 43:24)
concerns (43:21 - 43:24)
i (43:25 - 43:28)
is it the same concerns with uh wwe (43:28 - 43:34)
taking money from (43:31 - 43:34)
the (43:34 - 43:39)
what is it saudi prince well i mean (43:35 - 43:42)
okay yes bad politics left and right all (43:39 - 43:44)
over the world (43:42 - 43:48)
uh we can get a round-trip flight (43:44 - 43:52)
that to a place that's 53 miles away for (43:48 - 43:54)
uh 600 more importantly is this the (43:52 - 43:58)
first event in the middle east (43:54 - 44:00)
none of us are experts at talking about (43:58 - 44:02)
politics on the show but (44:00 - 44:05)
uh but this but politics aside this is (44:02 - 44:09)
the first pogo event in the middle east (44:05 - 44:11)
i believe so yeah it could be (44:09 - 44:13)
i i can't say for certain i think they (44:11 - 44:15)
may have had in the uae (44:13 - 44:17)
something previously but (44:15 - 44:20)
i can't say for sure (44:17 - 44:20)
i can't even think of like an event that (44:22 - 44:25)
would be in like africa though either i (44:23 - 44:27)
know not like i'm trying to think of (44:25 - 44:29)
like continents that like (44:27 - 44:30)
africa hasn't had one i don't think the (44:29 - 44:32)
middle i don't think india has had an (44:30 - 44:34)
event (44:32 - 44:37)
um (44:34 - 44:37)
this may be the first brazil got an (44:44 - 44:48)
event but i don't think anyone doesn't (44:46 - 44:50)
think south america has got an event (44:48 - 44:52)
just brazil (44:50 - 44:54)
yeah yeah brazil did get an event and (44:52 - 44:58)
then singapore got an event (44:54 - 44:58)
no event in china i don't think no event (45:01 - 45:07)
in russia (45:04 - 45:07)
well google doesn't operate in china so (45:08 - 45:14)
that would be an issue (45:11 - 45:14)
canada did get an event canada got that (45:17 - 45:23)
event a lot before the pandemic (45:20 - 45:23)
the the actual shocking thing here is (45:26 - 45:30)
japan didn't have an event (45:28 - 45:32)
they're trying to spread the wealth man (45:30 - 45:35)
japan can't have everything (45:32 - 45:37)
everything's gonna get its own event (45:35 - 45:39)
later they can yeah probably yeah it's (45:37 - 45:41)
to me it's kind of sucks that there's (45:39 - 45:44)
only three locations so my i just feel (45:41 - 45:46)
like there's going to be (45:44 - 45:47)
more (45:46 - 45:49)
in-person special events in different (45:47 - 45:51)
and they're just like sprinkling them (45:49 - 45:54)
throughout the year in different places (45:51 - 45:57)
yeah i just think like if this is a (45:54 - 45:58)
kanto event you would think that you (45:57 - 46:01)
would want it in japan (45:58 - 46:03)
you know where kanto is based off of oh (46:01 - 46:05)
well (46:03 - 46:05)
um (46:06 - 46:08)
who knows how long ago this was even (46:10 - 46:14)
planned to begin with too right and (46:12 - 46:16)
maybe maybe they were trying to get like (46:14 - 46:20)
u.s locations but no one wanted to (46:16 - 46:20)
confirm anything um (46:20 - 46:24)
or get anything down (46:22 - 46:25)
who knows (46:24 - 46:27)
uh i don't think we're going to you know (46:25 - 46:30)
if i was to pick and money was unlimited (46:27 - 46:32)
i would like to go to taiwan the lantern (46:30 - 46:34)
festival seems very cool hmm yeah i (46:32 - 46:38)
would go to that (46:34 - 46:38)
uh last bit of news here speaking about (46:46 - 46:53)
international stuff is uh the uk (46:48 - 46:56)
now has their own pokemon center (46:53 - 46:59)
congrats open your wallets (46:56 - 47:01)

so canada us and uk now sorry i'll sorry (47:01 - 47:06)
to anyone in perth you're still on the (47:05 - 47:08)
waiting list look australia doesn't get (47:06 - 47:09)

stuck in customs for 18 months i have a (47:15 - 47:20)
very long time i have ways around (47:18 - 47:22)
customs i think australia still has like (47:20 - 47:26)
the strictest customs right now (47:22 - 47:26)
should we move on question of the week (47:35 - 47:38)
we did not get to it last week we can (47:37 - 47:42)
get to it now yes yeah (47:38 - 47:43)
ready (47:42 - 47:46)
what is the question of the week i would (47:43 - 47:49)
really like to know (47:46 - 47:49)
are you (47:50 - 47:53)
referencing the (47:51 - 47:55)
peon to the oligarchy rudolph the (47:53 - 47:57)
red-nosed reindeer (47:55 - 48:00)
perhaps your only value as a worker is (47:57 - 48:03)
when you can conform to provide value to (48:00 - 48:05)
the oligarch (48:03 - 48:06)
yes okay perhaps thank you this is a (48:05 - 48:08)
this is a dumb question (48:06 - 48:11)
it's it's the uk pokemon center but if (48:08 - 48:13)
you're in france you can't like order (48:11 - 48:15)
from it that's i was gonna say it's too (48:13 - 48:19)
bad the uk is not in the eu anymore yeah (48:15 - 48:20)
because (48:19 - 48:23)
no (48:20 - 48:23)
again this is complicated politics that (48:23 - 48:27)
we don't have time for on your show we (48:25 - 48:29)
don't (48:27 - 48:30)
who knew this show would devolve into (48:29 - 48:32)
political i mean everything devolves (48:30 - 48:34)
into political everything but we are but (48:32 - 48:36)

real quick (50:08 - 50:10)
no cause you're gonna complain about (50:09 - 50:11)
buck (50:10 - 50:15)
yeah man that storyline sucks (50:11 - 50:15)
i told you it wasn't great back in the (50:18 - 50:22)
day it's not great now okay there's well (50:20 - 50:24)
there's one part i'm uh (50:22 - 50:26)
it's been three weeks we're gonna i'm (50:24 - 50:28)
gonna talk about one situation post game (50:26 - 50:30)
it's not even story related when you get (50:28 - 50:32)
to the town that buck lives in (50:30 - 50:34)
i don't remember what it's called (50:32 - 50:36)
it's like above the it's like the battle (50:34 - 50:38)
resort it's like above (50:36 - 50:39)
that when you get to the island there's (50:38 - 50:41)
four places to fly right the first place (50:39 - 50:43)
where you get there right second place (50:41 - 50:45)
is where the ribbon syndicate person is (50:43 - 50:49)
yep the third place is uh like north of (50:45 - 50:50)
that and then the fourth place is where (50:49 - 50:53)
buck lives and it's like a square (50:50 - 50:55)
okay yes (50:53 - 50:57)
and when you get to that town there's (50:55 - 50:59)
like a pokemon center a pokemart two (50:57 - 51:00)
houses (50:59 - 51:02)
three houses one is bucks and then (51:00 - 51:04)
that's it and then if you go a little to (51:02 - 51:06)
the right there's like a area where you (51:04 - 51:08)
can rock climb (51:06 - 51:10)
so you rock climb up there and then you (51:08 - 51:12)
gotta rock climb again and then all (51:10 - 51:14)
that's up here there's no grass there's (51:12 - 51:17)
no wild encounters there's just a house (51:14 - 51:18)
and when you go into that house there's (51:17 - 51:19)
a hiker (51:18 - 51:21)
and he goes (51:19 - 51:24)
he literally says i'm sorry you came all (51:21 - 51:26)
the way up here for nothing (51:24 - 51:29)
it's a sad day (51:26 - 51:32)
and that's it yes it's a very zen moment (51:29 - 51:32)
yes (51:32 - 51:35)
and i'm like you have just (51:32 - 51:37)
explained you have just summed up my (51:35 - 51:39)
feelings about the diamond and pearl (51:37 - 51:42)
remakes my man i just i'm so tired of (51:39 - 51:44)
hearing these yeah (51:42 - 51:47)
okay so in platinum they fix this guy in (51:44 - 51:52)
platinum he is a move tutor he gives you (51:47 - 51:55)
like mud shot and gunk shot and (51:52 - 51:57)
uh psychic shot he gives you like the (51:55 - 51:59)
moves (51:57 - 51:59)
like he (52:00 - 52:04)
he is the essence (52:02 - 52:05)
of what (52:04 - 52:08)
the the what the game is lacking you (52:05 - 52:11)
like they've faithfully specially (52:08 - 52:13)
become i'm losing my mind (52:11 - 52:17)
vanguard player that's yours they have (52:13 - 52:20)
faithfully picked and she (52:17 - 52:23)
chose what they wanted to bring back (52:20 - 52:25)
and they showed the question on the (52:23 - 52:29)
table sir i know but they chose (52:25 - 52:31)
to rebuild (52:29 - 52:35)
a useless part of the game (52:31 - 52:35)
it's like they chose to put one button (52:35 - 52:39)
on the poke etch (52:37 - 52:41)
they could just put both (52:39 - 52:43)
just (52:41 - 52:45)
put a little (52:43 - 52:48)
cut the button in half up and down (52:45 - 52:49)
they didn't (52:48 - 52:51)
that would have ruined your immersion (52:49 - 52:54)
like the thing about diamond and pearl (52:51 - 52:56)
is they're not great games (52:54 - 52:59)
they they they didn't run well (52:56 - 53:01)
they were very sluggish there was a lot (52:59 - 53:02)
of issues with them they were the first (53:01 - 53:04)
games in the ds they were obviously (53:02 - 53:06)
clearly rushed like most video games are (53:04 - 53:08)
and the nice thing about like a crystal (53:06 - 53:10)
or an emerald or an ultra sun ultra moon (53:08 - 53:13)
is they're able to go back and be like (53:10 - 53:14)
this is what we didn't get to finish (53:13 - 53:16)
this is what we got like (53:14 - 53:18)
that whole island (53:16 - 53:21)
is really not finished at all in diamond (53:18 - 53:24)
and pearl it's really bad like your post (53:21 - 53:26)
game in diamond and pearl (53:24 - 53:28)
is kind of is actually it's not kind of (53:26 - 53:29)
bad it is bad (53:28 - 53:32)
and that's fine i understand you you had (53:29 - 53:34)
to get the game out it was the first (53:32 - 53:35)
game on diamond and pearl there's tons (53:34 - 53:38)
of articles on how they struggled to (53:35 - 53:41)
move from the game boy to the ds totally (53:38 - 53:43)
understand (53:41 - 53:45)
i don't think it's acceptable to be like (53:43 - 53:48)
let's ignore the progress we made in (53:45 - 53:52)
platinum to make this post game good and (53:48 - 53:54)
to like have this island and just ignore (53:52 - 53:57)
that existed to put back in (53:54 - 54:00)
the bad post game (53:57 - 54:01)
that (54:00 - 54:03)
you knew that was like you knew you (54:01 - 54:06)
didn't finish like we all know like when (54:03 - 54:08)
i built websites for a living i knew (54:06 - 54:11)
what was broken on that website i knew (54:08 - 54:13)
what i had to go back to to fix and i (54:11 - 54:16)
also knew this is a priority this is not (54:13 - 54:19)
but i'm like i know that it's broken and (54:16 - 54:21)
it needs to be fixed (54:19 - 54:24)
it's just it's frustrating my answer is (54:21 - 54:26)
i don't think i've ever gotten any (54:24 - 54:28)
pokemon christmas gift except unless (54:26 - 54:30)
steve gave me something and that would (54:28 - 54:32)
probably be the only pokemon christmas (54:30 - 54:35)
gift i ever got (54:32 - 54:37)
i got you a really uh i got you a (54:35 - 54:39)
crochet book i think last year you got (54:37 - 54:42)
me a book of titans knitting stitches (54:39 - 54:44)
yes that is not pokemon related i know i (54:42 - 54:49)
just hey look i got you a gift i (54:44 - 54:49)
i also cannot think of anybody who's (54:51 - 54:56)
given me a pokemon gift off the top of (54:54 - 54:58)
my head (54:56 - 54:58)
oh wait no no i take that back (54:58 - 55:03)
last (55:01 - 55:06)
last year (55:03 - 55:06)
no (55:06 - 55:09)
you also have to remember that i the (55:07 - 55:11)
kind of person where like if christmas (55:09 - 55:14)
didn't exist it wouldn't bother me i i (55:11 - 55:16)
don't get excited for or enjoy christmas (55:14 - 55:20)
so i got the grookie jersey (55:16 - 55:22)
from pokemon center for christmas (55:20 - 55:25)
i love that thing hmm (55:22 - 55:27)
i don't know if i have like a memorable (55:25 - 55:29)
like i got pokemon red and blue for (55:27 - 55:31)
christmas (55:29 - 55:35)
and then i got pokemon (55:31 - 55:36)
i think every other pokemon game i got (55:35 - 55:39)
on like release day or we're very close (55:36 - 55:42)
to um yeah so pokemon red and blue i got (55:39 - 55:44)
specifically on christmas with the game (55:42 - 55:46)
boy pocket (55:44 - 55:47)
uh (55:46 - 55:49)
i do remember (55:47 - 55:51)
we it's not favorite it's just (55:49 - 55:54)
we had like secret santas and my brother (55:51 - 55:56)
pulled me because when you get that (55:54 - 55:57)
certain age you don't want to buy all (55:56 - 55:58)
your siblings if you put them in the hat (55:57 - 56:00)
you pull one of your siblings (55:58 - 56:03)
and i think our our spend limit was like (56:00 - 56:06)
30 or 35 or whatever not expensive (56:03 - 56:09)
and he got me just like a mug from (56:06 - 56:12)
pokemon center and it was like 15 bucks (56:09 - 56:14)
i look i know every price on pokemon (56:12 - 56:17)
center because you look at it a lot i do (56:14 - 56:19)
and i opened it and it was a pokemon it (56:17 - 56:21)
was the pokemon mug (56:19 - 56:23)
and he just looks at me with this like (56:21 - 56:25)
big smile on his face and he was like (56:23 - 56:29)
it's a pretty good gift isn't it (56:25 - 56:31)
and i'm like yeah yeah i mean i mean you (56:29 - 56:34)

person said yes it's great and wonderful (56:54 - 57:00)

knowing the one thing that i'm into and (57:00 - 57:04)
finding a thing that i would appreciate (57:02 - 57:06)
and be able to use (57:04 - 57:08)
thank you dear sweet brother (57:06 - 57:11)
i appreciate you and the joy you bring (57:08 - 57:15)

anything rude i was just like guarantee (57:18 - 57:23)
you did i maybe maybe (57:20 - 57:25)
who (57:23 - 57:28)
knows can even recall i mean i can i (57:25 - 57:30)
clearly remember he didn't hit the speed (57:28 - 57:33)
is the spend limit my (57:30 - 57:35)
so the best thing that i ever purchased (57:33 - 57:40)
for myself was back in 99 (57:35 - 57:40)
target had all these pokemon (57:40 - 57:46)
specific target only ornaments (57:43 - 57:49)
they're big chunky things and i'm (57:46 - 57:50)
to this day (57:49 - 57:52)
happy that i purchased those they're on (57:50 - 57:55)
my tree every year nobody else i know (57:52 - 57:57)
has them (57:55 - 57:59)
love them love them love and love them i (57:57 - 58:02)
got i got the original form (57:59 - 58:04)
pikachu which is now a gigantic max (58:02 - 58:07)
pikachu on my tree i got the gengar i (58:04 - 58:10)
got the squirtle i got the charmander i (58:07 - 58:12)
got the psyduck (58:10 - 58:14)
what's weird is they did squirtle and (58:12 - 58:16)
charmander they absolutely did not do (58:14 - 58:17)
bubble sore (58:16 - 58:20)
the choices they made for that ornament (58:17 - 58:21)
series (58:20 - 58:25)
pikachu given charmander given squirtle (58:21 - 58:27)
given (58:25 - 58:29)
psyduck (58:27 - 58:31)
and gengar psyduck is very popular from (58:29 - 58:33)
the anime yeah so (58:31 - 58:35)
they are also popular (58:33 - 58:37)
no charizard though (58:35 - 58:40)
no charizard no bulbasaur not all the (58:37 - 58:41)
starters (58:40 - 58:44)
[Laughter] (58:41 - 58:46)
look bulbasaur didn't get his moment (58:44 - 58:47)
until very very very very long (58:46 - 58:50)
afterwards very late yes (58:47 - 58:52)
uh this is from youtube if you're (58:50 - 58:54)
watching on youtube feel free to like (58:52 - 58:56)
comment all that stuff uh this is uh (58:54 - 58:57)
from zach (58:56 - 59:00)
which pokemon had the best glow up from (58:57 - 59:04)
the other original sprites (59:00 - 59:04)
probably mew mew's original sprite was (59:07 - 59:11)
so bad (59:10 - 59:16)
so are we talking about like going from (59:11 - 59:16)
pixel sprites to 3d models yeah that's (59:17 - 59:22)
what i've interpreted the question yeah (59:20 - 59:23)
okay yeah uh (59:22 - 59:25)
yeah mu (59:23 - 59:29)
mu's originals are not great no (59:25 - 59:29)
um (59:29 - 59:33)
bravery looks better 3d than in sprite (59:30 - 59:35)
form (59:33 - 59:35)
i mean any of the birds (59:36 - 59:39)
i would say electros looked better in (59:39 - 59:45)
sprite than in 3d (59:41 - 59:45)
i don't know why electros's sprite just (59:48 - 59:51)
stands out to me in black and white (59:50 - 59:54)
that's like so good (59:51 - 59:54)
um i want to say (59:54 - 59:58)
[Music] (59:56 - 59:59)
hmm (59:58 - 60:02)
i think (59:59 - 60:02)
i think suicune looks better (60:04 - 60:07)
green (60:06 - 60:09)
that's a good one you know i was going (60:07 - 60:11)
to say articuno i think any of the (60:09 - 60:12)
quadrupeds (60:11 - 60:14)
i see articuno still has some very good (60:12 - 60:16)
things to do with the wings and stuff so (60:14 - 60:17)
the sprites are really good but i feel (60:16 - 60:18)
like (60:17 - 60:21)
the complicated design for suicune with (60:18 - 60:22)
the ribbons on the side like the ribbons (60:21 - 60:25)
get really lost in the old sprites like (60:22 - 60:26)
sylveon yeah (60:25 - 60:30)
and the 3d versions you can really pick (60:26 - 60:32)
them out (60:30 - 60:33)
better they really sort of stand they (60:32 - 60:35)
have their own movement (60:33 - 60:36)
they (60:35 - 60:38)
they could make them fit with the theme (60:36 - 60:39)
of the body more because they didn't (60:38 - 60:41)
really have to change the white because (60:39 - 60:42)
they could move i think (60:41 - 60:44)
for me it's going to be tweaking so we (60:42 - 60:47)
can get a real good glow up from (60:44 - 60:50)
from sprite form (60:47 - 60:50)
yeah suicune is a good one (60:50 - 60:54)
i should remember like the red and blue (60:52 - 60:57)
articuno being very like plump (60:54 - 60:59)
and like kind of sitting down with its (60:57 - 61:00)
tail in the front (60:59 - 61:03)
maybe i'm misremembering that well you (61:00 - 61:05)
can look at him on bulba garden (61:03 - 61:07)
let me go there (61:05 - 61:10)
i like to imagine things i well (61:07 - 61:12)
you imagine them wrong (61:10 - 61:17)
most of the time so let's go look (61:12 - 61:17)
so (61:19 - 61:25)
in the glow up articuno got feet (61:20 - 61:27)
hey look feet are hard that helps that (61:25 - 61:28)
helps (61:27 - 61:30)
um i (61:28 - 61:33)
i do think it looks better (61:30 - 61:34)
again because they have more movement in (61:33 - 61:36)
the tail and then the gen 1 sprite (61:34 - 61:38)
literally the tail is covering the feet (61:36 - 61:39)
and it looks like it's sitting on its (61:38 - 61:41)
tail (61:39 - 61:44)
here's a weird one hoot hoot (61:41 - 61:45)
i think he just looks better like as a (61:44 - 61:48)
brown boy like you get the the roundness (61:45 - 61:52)
yeah the 3d model (61:48 - 61:52)
let's look at let's look (61:52 - 61:55)
honestly any of the first generation (61:59 - 62:04)
ones any of the kanto ones because those (62:01 - 62:06)
i don't know (62:04 - 62:09)
looks pretty round and cute in the old (62:06 - 62:10)
sprites (62:09 - 62:10)
i (62:10 - 62:13)
i i reject that one into the bin with (62:10 - 62:15)
that one (62:13 - 62:15)
teddy ursa as well teddy ursula looks (62:19 - 62:22)
good in 3d (62:21 - 62:24)
teddy actually does look good in 3d (62:22 - 62:26)
teddy or says cutie (62:24 - 62:27)
uh (62:26 - 62:30)
is which one does (62:27 - 62:32)
which one do which of the eevees do i (62:30 - 62:34)
not like their (62:32 - 62:35)
sprite is it jolttown that i didn't like (62:34 - 62:37)
their originals yeah flareon had a bad (62:35 - 62:39)
one too i would say the first three (62:37 - 62:42)
evolutions were not great in judd one or (62:39 - 62:43)
two (62:42 - 62:45)
yeah i really do think it's jolteon the (62:43 - 62:47)
one that i really just don't like (62:45 - 62:49)
let me get down there (62:47 - 62:54)
oh god these old ones have such long (62:49 - 62:54)
yeah the yellow one is awful (62:54 - 63:00)
the yellow sprite is just not good isn't (62:57 - 63:01)
it bad (63:00 - 63:03)
uh (63:01 - 63:06)
well pokemon of the week okay uh i may (63:03 - 63:09)
have aired in the way that i wrote (63:06 - 63:12)
uh last week's pokemon of the week but (63:09 - 63:14)
some people got it right so i don't feel (63:12 - 63:18)
too badly i probably left out a sentence (63:14 - 63:20)
or two that i should have (63:18 - 63:24)
put in there but i made uh basically (63:20 - 63:26)
proposed at the beginning of the (63:24 - 63:27)
clue (63:26 - 63:30)
that all pokemon were normal type until (63:27 - 63:32)
people started to classify them with (63:30 - 63:34)
other types and then i asked the (63:32 - 63:37)
question which is the first in pokedex (63:34 - 63:39)
order pokemon to have its type changed (63:37 - 63:40)
through the addition of a newly (63:39 - 63:42)
discovered type and not through the (63:40 - 63:45)
addition of a regional variant (63:42 - 63:47)
and the answer is (63:45 - 63:50)
it's (63:47 - 63:50)
jigglypuff (63:50 - 63:53)
no (63:54 - 63:56)
no (63:55 - 63:58)
it's (63:56 - 63:59)
fairy (63:58 - 64:02)
don't that was close (63:59 - 64:03)
it was just remembering who came in the (64:02 - 64:04)
pokedex first (64:03 - 64:07)
pokemons (64:04 - 64:08)
although sort of like i was thinking (64:07 - 64:11)
about that i'm like (64:08 - 64:11)
five (64:13 - 64:18)
yeah and jb is like 40 something (64:14 - 64:20)
39. (64:18 - 64:20)
well it was just a matter of which one (64:20 - 64:24)
came first yeah (64:22 - 64:27)
the whole point (64:24 - 64:27)
so my first guess was magnemite because (64:27 - 64:32)
they were the first to get the (64:31 - 64:35)
additional steel type added yes (64:32 - 64:37)
in johto before they did fairy type yes (64:35 - 64:39)
which i know i think it confused a bunch (64:37 - 64:40)
of people thinking but then if you (64:39 - 64:43)
thought about like okay but (64:40 - 64:45)
post all of the changes clefairy comes (64:43 - 64:47)
first which is how i got so that's just (64:45 - 64:50)
the first in pokedex order right and if (64:47 - 64:51)
i had not said (64:50 - 64:52)
not through the addition of a regional (64:51 - 64:55)
variant then it's frittata because (64:52 - 64:57)
that guy right dark type (64:55 - 64:58)
um (64:57 - 65:02)
fyi the gen 1 flareon sprite is (64:58 - 65:04)
so bad (65:02 - 65:07)
i think mu is still the worst though (65:04 - 65:09)
probably i clefairy is one of my (65:07 - 65:11)
favorites and i'm mad that it didn't (65:09 - 65:12)
become the (65:11 - 65:16)
mascot to this day (65:12 - 65:16)
all right i love cofery this week's (65:17 - 65:20)
pokemon i did not have a lot of time to (65:18 - 65:22)
prepare so (65:20 - 65:24)
we have no do we have any trivia about (65:22 - 65:27)

moon stone an item that doesn't exist in (65:57 - 66:01)
brilliant diamond shining pearl (65:59 - 66:03)

years in a cave (66:03 - 66:08)
