I was watching it right before I started (1:00 - 1:05)
coming up here and setting up I was like (1:03 - 1:06)
y'all aren't awake so I'm going to watch (1:05 - 1:11)
me some Pokemon anime I was awake yeah (1:06 - 1:16)
I I finished Horizons so um that will be (1:11 - 1:17)
a big part of the show oh there there (1:16 - 1:20)
will be no spoilers for the the anime (1:17 - 1:21)
that we only got 12 episodes of that (1:20 - 1:24)
Japan has 45 episodes of there will be (1:21 - 1:25)
no (1:24 - 1:27)
spoilers the episodes that have been out (1:25 - 1:29)
there for a full year in other parts of (1:27 - 1:32)
the world yeah but we will I think there (1:29 - 1:36)
are 22 English episodes if you were to (1:32 - 1:38)
like switch to the UK (1:36 - 1:41)
broadcast anyways because I there's no (1:38 - 1:43)
difference between the UK and the (1:41 - 1:46)
American from they didn't get new voice (1:43 - 1:48)
actors for those (1:46 - 1:50)
two I think there's only two sets of (1:48 - 1:53)
voice actors Japanese and then (1:50 - 1:55)
English it lists a bunch of other (1:53 - 1:58)
languages I promise I (1:55 - 1:58)
checked cuz I was I was well okay hold (1:59 - 2:03)
on before we talk about the anime cuz (2:02 - 2:05)
it's the first part of this the show uh (2:03 - 2:08)
we got Anime we got uh raids we got (2:05 - 2:11)
Toyota makes a motorcycle about maridon (2:08 - 2:13)
and then we have Pokemon go Fest that's (2:11 - 2:17)
that's that's the episode for you (2:13 - 2:21)
guys um okay so uh Pokemon Horizons I (2:17 - 2:25)
get I thought I was I i' misremembered I (2:21 - 2:28)
I was wrong I thought that Veron sorry (2:25 - 2:30)
not Veronica Taylor I thought that Sarah (2:28 - 2:33)
atach chenny was Roy I thought that (2:30 - 2:36)
was I thought that was talked about like (2:33 - 2:40)
from last year's San Diego Comic Con (2:36 - 2:42)
that people were excited that Sarah was (2:40 - 2:46)
in it Sarah is in it just not as Roy but (2:42 - 2:49)
not as Roy but Roy if if you didn't know (2:46 - 2:51)
any better or if somebody said hey Sarah (2:49 - 2:53)
is Roy you could probably be like oh (2:51 - 2:56)
yeah that sounds like Sarah but it's not (2:53 - 2:59)
her yeah the new the voice actor of Roy (2:56 - 3:01)
under (2:59 - 3:06)
Kun uh they that was last name that was (3:01 - 3:08)
definitely I listened to a couple of (3:06 - 3:09)
interviews to try to make sure I got it (3:08 - 3:12)
right um they sound very similar to (3:09 - 3:14)
Sarah so I also had to look it up just (3:12 - 3:17)
to make sure that Ash didn't just turn (3:14 - 3:18)
into (3:17 - 3:23)
Roy yeah yeah I was again I I I I just (3:18 - 3:25)
remember and I'm it's probably just me (3:23 - 3:27)
misremembering I just remember that they (3:25 - 3:29)
showed that what like First 12 minutes (3:27 - 3:31)
of the Pokemon an May over a year ago at (3:29 - 3:35)
San Diego ComicCon and the big news was (3:31 - 3:36)
like Sarah was (3:35 - 3:39)
back and then people were talking about (3:36 - 3:41)
Roy so I guess in my head I was like oh (3:39 - 3:43)
Sarah must be Roy but Sarah is just the (3:41 - 3:47)
very first girl that says like who is (3:43 - 3:51)
that girl referring to Leo and some of (3:47 - 3:54)
the Pokemon I think yeah (3:51 - 3:56)
yeah I thought they would have given her (3:54 - 3:58)
a bigger (3:56 - 4:01)
role I mean I'm I'm sure she'll be like (3:58 - 4:05)
multiple random girls or boys returning (4:01 - 4:09)
characters but yeah in my head I was (4:05 - 4:11)
just like oh they just she's not she's (4:09 - 4:13)
just she's going to be Roy that makes (4:11 - 4:16)
sense because Ash is a boy she plays (4:13 - 4:19)
young it's very common for women to play (4:16 - 4:23)
young boy characters um but no uh and (4:19 - 4:25)
the more I saw Roy I was like oh okay (4:23 - 4:27)
this is like if you saw like 10 minutes (4:25 - 4:28)
of Roy you'd be like ah this sounds like (4:27 - 4:30)
Sarah but the now that Roy is like (4:28 - 4:33)
fleshed out like okay Roy is definitely (4:30 - 4:36)
his own (4:33 - 4:36)
person so um (4:39 - 4:45)
okay (4:42 - 4:49)
the the the TW there's 12 episodes on (4:45 - 4:52)
Netflix (4:49 - 4:55)
MH there there's nothing here on (4:52 - 4:57)
pokemon.com that would add anything new (4:55 - 5:00)
here follow Leo and Roy (4:57 - 5:02)
um I do have something that refers to an (5:00 - 5:04)
interview with Ash but before we get to (5:02 - 5:08)
that kind of stuff um Hannah how far are (5:04 - 5:11)
you in Horizons I am halfway through so (5:08 - 5:13)
I have met Leo and I have met Roy and I (5:11 - 5:17)
have seen their partner Pokemon and (5:13 - 5:20)
those beginnings of interactions and I'm (5:17 - 5:23)
really enjoying all of it honestly I (5:20 - 5:25)
like it as much as I expected I like it (5:23 - 5:28)
better than the anime with Ash that was (5:25 - 5:30)
kind of getting (5:28 - 5:32)
repetitive I know they continued to (5:30 - 5:35)
improve on it but this feels like it's (5:32 - 5:40)
an actual Story 25 years more (5:35 - 5:40)
repetitive I mean I I liked the old (5:40 - 5:44)
anime I grew up with the old anime but I (5:42 - 5:46)
don't know whether it's because I just (5:44 - 5:49)
like Leo or because I like the fact that (5:46 - 5:52)
this feels like a brand new story (5:49 - 5:54)
completely unlike what we have had (5:52 - 5:56)
before in a lot of ways I'm really (5:54 - 5:59)
enjoying it Leo is kind of introverted (5:56 - 6:02)
and overthinks a whole lot and there are (5:59 - 6:04)
some points where it's kind of hard to (6:02 - 6:06)
tell whether she's talking out loud or (6:04 - 6:08)
just thinking to herself and the (6:06 - 6:12)
animation isn't as good as it used to be (6:08 - 6:15)
so that makes it even harder to tell (6:12 - 6:18)
sometimes but I still really like (6:15 - 6:23)
characters plus they B Bud on that last (6:18 - 6:23)
season we have a bunch of adult Pokemon (6:24 - 6:30)
trainers as main characters in this new (6:27 - 6:35)
series or at least as as primary Side (6:30 - 6:37)
characters yeah it's kind of they don't (6:35 - 6:39)
even say Leo's (6:37 - 6:45)
age at all no if it's if it's like Pala (6:39 - 6:48)
that she should be closer like 14 yeah (6:45 - 6:51)
which also I feel like makes sense cuz I (6:48 - 6:52)
I feel (6:51 - 6:56)
like as a 10-year-old I wasn't in my (6:52 - 6:58)
head as much as I (6:56 - 7:03)
was as like a what what grade are you in (6:58 - 7:05)
in for 14 like high (7:03 - 7:07)
school probably freshman depends (7:05 - 7:09)
freshman last freshman in high school (7:07 - 7:11)
yeah that's been high high school was (7:09 - 7:12)
set (7:11 - 7:15)
up because yeah that's true when I (7:12 - 7:19)
started junior high junior high was (7:15 - 7:22)
789th and then I switched schools and (7:19 - 7:24)
their junior high was only 78 and their (7:22 - 7:27)
high school was 9 10 11 12 yeah my high (7:24 - 7:30)
school was 9 10 11 12 it that that (7:27 - 7:33)
varies but yeah you're around the ninth (7:30 - 7:36)
ninth (7:33 - 7:36)
grade yeah she I don't know it does come (7:36 - 7:41)
across I'm pretty sure in pal your (7:39 - 7:43)
characters are supposed to be like 14 in (7:41 - 7:44)
sudden of moon I think your characters (7:43 - 7:45)
are supposed to be like 12 I don't know (7:44 - 7:48)
they've like slowly aged up is it just (7:45 - 7:50)
me or does Leo come across as a little (7:48 - 7:52)
bit older than (7:50 - 7:58)
Roy no she does okay that I mean I mean (7:52 - 7:59)
it's hard to tell it's hard to tell (7:58 - 8:03)
because Roy is (7:59 - 8:06)
excitable and we equate excitability (8:03 - 8:09)
with immaturity so he reads younger (8:06 - 8:11)
where they may be the exact same age (8:09 - 8:13)
yeah that's absolutely Fair there was (8:11 - 8:15)
also a height difference that had me (8:13 - 8:18)
thinking that at one point (8:15 - 8:18)
to oh I kind of I guess I didn't think (8:18 - 8:25)
about Roy's age as much as Leo (8:21 - 8:31)
verse uh emio verse freed (8:25 - 8:33)
because I can't tell how old emio is (8:31 - 8:36)
compared to like fre Fred is adult right (8:33 - 8:39)
obviously freed freed is in his 20s (8:36 - 8:41)
probably I guess there will be minor (8:39 - 8:44)
spoilers least minor so M minor minor (8:41 - 8:46)
spoilers they they it's like (8:44 - 8:50)
episode three they say that freed is a (8:46 - 8:54)
professor um that's an episode six I can (8:50 - 8:56)
yeah yep I just they definitely they (8:54 - 8:58)
definitely they definitely say it before (8:56 - 8:59)
the first four episodes cuz I knew that (8:58 - 9:02)
well I knew that in New York they say it (8:59 - 9:05)
really quickly um and then they they (9:02 - 9:08)
they flesh it out more in episode (9:05 - 9:12)
6 that he is a professor no they say (9:08 - 9:14)
exactly in episode four because that's (9:12 - 9:16)
when you meet (9:14 - 9:19)
Roy um that Fred is Professor yeah (9:16 - 9:21)
because the old grandpa guy calls him (9:19 - 9:25)
professor and he says don't yeah that (9:21 - 9:28)
was maybe episode five it was 100% in (9:25 - 9:30)
the first four episodes cuz that's all I (9:28 - 9:32)
saw in New York and I knew New (9:30 - 9:36)
York I don't know I'm just in episode (9:32 - 9:40)
six I don't know I'm halfway through I (9:36 - 9:41)
don't pay attention because I just let (9:40 - 9:43)
them run so I'm like I don't know what (9:41 - 9:45)
episode this is when it's done it's done (9:43 - 9:49)
I'll look when I have to start up (9:45 - 9:53)
again um so Professor being is (9:49 - 9:56)
definitely an adult yes and so then that (9:53 - 10:00)
like I have no clue in what age range (9:56 - 10:02)
atho (10:00 - 10:05)
is like also adult because it looks like (10:02 - 10:08)
he because he has a (10:05 - 10:12)
job he's clearly employed I don't know (10:08 - 10:14)
you don't have to be an adult to be (10:12 - 10:17)
employed sure sure sure but like he's (10:14 - 10:19)
not reporting to school or at least (10:17 - 10:21)
we're not seeing him reporting to school (10:19 - 10:23)
I mean he feels like a teenager he feels (10:21 - 10:26)
like a Zuko character yeah slightly (10:23 - 10:29)
older than the main characters he feels (10:26 - 10:33)
in the 1 18 19 range yeah maybe maybe (10:29 - 10:37)
even I would say 16 17 17 kind of you (10:33 - 10:40)
know in that four years (10:37 - 10:43)
where you (10:40 - 10:43)
know he's people's bosses but he also (10:43 - 10:49)
has a boss yeah I mean he's but there's (10:47 - 10:51)
clearly some nepotism going on there (10:49 - 10:54)
yeah it's clearly people's bosses sort (10:51 - 10:56)
of kind (10:54 - 10:59)
of I mean this is an evil organization (10:56 - 11:01)
we don't don't know what their power (10:59 - 11:03)
structure is (11:01 - 11:05)
yet uh Greg how far are you do you know (11:03 - 11:07)
I'm about halfway I think I don't know (11:05 - 11:08)
what episodes I'm because I don't pay (11:07 - 11:10)
attention oh okay (11:08 - 11:15)
uh I'm in an episode after everybody is (11:10 - 11:19)
finally on the Airship the Airship so (11:15 - 11:22)
everybody no more like these are the (11:19 - 11:25)
main character introduction stuff like (11:22 - 11:27)
everybody is now together and they're (11:25 - 11:31)
all frustrating me because again they (11:27 - 11:33)
write them where like who could this (11:31 - 11:36)
character be and I'm like if you pay any (11:33 - 11:39)
attention you know this character is but (11:36 - 11:41)
fine (11:39 - 11:43)
whatever it's supposed to be a mystery (11:41 - 11:46)
who some of these people are and I'm (11:43 - 11:49)
like um is it (11:46 - 11:49)
though yeah I think it's fine I mean (11:49 - 11:55)
like again I think it's probably less (11:52 - 11:57)
obvious I don't know if the thing didn't (11:55 - 11:59)
exist for the last year and you would (11:57 - 12:02)
like see like random (11:59 - 12:04)
screenshots and you're like ah they got (12:02 - 12:06)
to put they got to put two and two (12:04 - 12:10)
together eventually um oh so uh just (12:06 - 12:12)
some disclosure here the Pokemon company (12:10 - 12:15)
paid for me to go out to New York uh (12:12 - 12:17)
they paid for my flight in hotel I went (12:15 - 12:19)
to a red carpet there was actually a red (12:17 - 12:20)
carpet it was very tiny though I went to (12:19 - 12:24)
a red carpet preview of Pokemon Horizons (12:20 - 12:26)
uh I took a bunch of video that I was (12:24 - 12:27)
like I don't know what I'm going to do (12:26 - 12:31)
with because it's just just a venue that (12:27 - 12:33)
had like popcorn and and stuff and (12:31 - 12:35)
obviously you couldn't film the screen (12:33 - 12:37)
that would be (12:35 - 12:39)
weird uh but I did see the first four (12:37 - 12:43)
episodes um they brought they invited (12:39 - 12:44)
like a hundred people out I don't know (12:43 - 12:47)
how I was told like 30% were content (12:44 - 12:50)
creators 70% were like people of media (12:47 - 12:54)
so like I IGN Gamespot people who report (12:50 - 12:57)
on news um game the G people were (12:54 - 12:59)
allowed to bring like plus ones and and (12:57 - 13:01)
their kids their kids counted for plus (12:59 - 13:03)
one so you saw a lot of games media (13:01 - 13:04)
bring their (13:03 - 13:06)
kids uh so I would say there was (13:04 - 13:09)
probably like 20% if if you imagine a (13:06 - 13:12)
100 people imagine like 80 adults and (13:09 - 13:15)
then 20 kids which is not still not a (13:12 - 13:17)
good ratio that's still too many kids (13:15 - 13:19)
but uh they had a good time they had (13:17 - 13:21)
like they they had their like coloring (13:19 - 13:23)
station Pokemon loves coloring stations (13:21 - 13:25)
like you go to like a worlds or n (13:23 - 13:28)
Nationals or regionals any of these (13:25 - 13:30)
events they got coloring (13:28 - 13:32)
uh I met Captain Pikachu we got a (13:30 - 13:34)
picture with Captain Pikachu he was real (13:32 - 13:38)
great they had like a bar but the bar (13:34 - 13:40)
was all non-alcoholic drinks so you (13:38 - 13:42)
could get like a Pokeball fruit punch (13:40 - 13:46)
that sounds great did did it have white (13:42 - 13:49)
liquid and a red liquid on top there no (13:46 - 13:54)
it's just just it had like the salt on (13:49 - 13:56)
the (13:54 - 13:59)
rim but then it was just fruit punch so (13:56 - 14:00)
like a (13:59 - 14:03)
margarita without the (14:00 - 14:07)
alcohol just Fruit Punch Yeah so like a (14:03 - 14:10)
margarita without the alcohol but how is (14:07 - 14:12)
it Pokeball then like they should have (14:10 - 14:15)
like done that the cup the cup the cup (14:12 - 14:17)
had like the Pokeball like the top half (14:15 - 14:20)
of the cup was like frosted Boo or the (14:17 - 14:23)
bottom half yeah bottom half cuz the top (14:20 - 14:24)
because that would have been more white (14:23 - 14:27)
and then the fruit punch turned the top (14:24 - 14:27)
red look (14:27 - 14:34)
sure it was the the theme that (14:30 - 14:36)
counted they (14:34 - 14:40)
did this drove me insane again thank you (14:36 - 14:44)
Pokemon for inviting me they had a but (14:40 - 14:47)
but they had a they had free tote bags (14:44 - 14:50)
and then they would embroider embroider (14:47 - 14:52)
your initials on the tote bag which is (14:50 - 14:55)
very cool and they had three tote bags (14:52 - 14:57)
you could pick from the first one was (14:55 - 15:01)
spatio the second was Fu Coco and the (14:57 - 15:04)
third was my favorite starter Captain (15:01 - 15:09)
Pikachu there was no (15:04 - 15:12)
quackley they had three tote bags two of (15:09 - 15:15)
the Stars Captain Pikachu (15:12 - 15:17)
unacceptable they've definitely decided (15:15 - 15:20)
which are the popular ones they and I (15:17 - 15:21)
was like where's the they're like (15:20 - 15:23)
where's the quaxi and they're like I (15:21 - 15:25)
know we're upset too and I was (15:23 - 15:29)
like when you watch the anime it at (15:25 - 15:31)
least the first four episodes you (15:29 - 15:33)
understand maybe why they don't do a (15:31 - 15:35)
quackley (15:33 - 15:39)
bag but quax ley's in it yeah I meanley (15:35 - 15:42)
quackley is also a starter of the region (15:39 - 15:44)
that's been out for two years for your (15:42 - 15:47)
anime (15:44 - 15:47)
hit they it's it's very much (15:47 - 15:53)
uh for the quaxi thing it's very much (15:51 - 15:55)
like (15:53 - 15:59)
uh gosh what what sword and shield where (15:55 - 16:02)
it took forever for ash to get um no sun (15:59 - 16:04)
and moon it took forever for papulo to (16:02 - 16:07)
show up in Sun and Moon (16:04 - 16:10)
forever and at least quax is like there (16:07 - 16:11)
on the Airship and like no one (16:10 - 16:15)
acknowledges them until later (16:11 - 16:19)
but there is a qule present it's in the (16:15 - 16:21)
it's in the end Theme at least maybe (16:19 - 16:24)
even the entry theme he's in the entry (16:21 - 16:28)
theme yeah quy's there qule is all over (16:24 - 16:31)
the place y'all are just haters yes I I (16:28 - 16:34)
there's the the the YouTuber the (16:31 - 16:35)
YouTuber has a quackle and there's a (16:34 - 16:37)
quackle on the Airship there's there's (16:35 - 16:40)
two quax leys and you could also put two (16:37 - 16:42)
and two together eventually but you know (16:40 - 16:45)
yep you sure could you (16:42 - 16:48)
could oh you know it could be like it (16:45 - 16:49)
could be like another Squirtle Squad (16:48 - 16:51)
maybe there's just many quackle walking (16:49 - 16:54)
around this world and they will all meet (16:51 - 16:57)
up put out fires one of them will have (16:54 - 17:00)
glasses (16:57 - 17:00)
uh (17:03 - 17:08)
I really really enjoyed all 12 episodes (17:04 - 17:10)
I think there was like out of the 12 I (17:08 - 17:13)
watched this is how I always gauge anime (17:10 - 17:15)
or just like any form of TV this is why (17:13 - 17:17)
like when people are like Steve you like (17:15 - 17:20)
wrestling you watch wrestling watch is a (17:17 - 17:23)
really strong word to use when I'm refer (17:20 - 17:27)
like like wrestling is on something else (17:23 - 17:30)
is taking like it it's it's there (17:27 - 17:32)
somewhere behind my computer screen as (17:30 - 17:34)
I'm like working on something so I (17:32 - 17:37)
always gauge how I like TV based off of (17:34 - 17:40)
like how often am I picking up my phone (17:37 - 17:44)
how often am I checking Twitter or uh (17:40 - 17:46)
maybe not paying attention uh like the (17:44 - 17:48)
the one piece live action I was very (17:46 - 17:50)
much (17:48 - 17:52)
like I I can't look I need to know I (17:50 - 17:54)
can't look away this is very good I (17:52 - 17:56)
enjoyed that a lot uh there's like only (17:54 - 17:58)
like one or two parts in the 12 episodes (17:56 - 18:01)
where I was like okay come on let's (17:58 - 18:04)
let's get a move on here but I think I (18:01 - 18:07)
think the pacing is is is really (18:04 - 18:09)
good (18:07 - 18:11)
um and obviously I watched with a bunch (18:09 - 18:13)
of people in New York and then I was (18:11 - 18:16)
like I was like I'll start over on my on (18:13 - 18:18)
my couch um just in case there was (18:16 - 18:21)
anything cut I guess I don't know like I (18:18 - 18:23)
was like there was no who's that Pokemon (18:21 - 18:26)
in New York oh yeah and I was like maybe (18:23 - 18:28)
they cut that so I was like let me watch (18:26 - 18:31)
the first episode again I was like oh no (18:28 - 18:32)
they just there we're just done with (18:31 - 18:34)
who's that Pokemon I guess well there's (18:32 - 18:38)
no like there's no noiss there's no (18:34 - 18:39)
intermission they're even pretending (18:38 - 18:42)
anymore that this is on a TV station (18:39 - 18:44)
that has to run ads they're like nope (18:42 - 18:45)
you're already paying what ads would (18:44 - 18:47)
take care of so but it is it is on like (18:45 - 18:52)
Tokyo TV and it's on Canadian TV I think (18:47 - 18:54)
I think it's on their normal TV in (18:52 - 18:59)
Canada um it's on somebody's regular TV (18:54 - 19:00)
so I (18:59 - 19:03)
don't I it kind of weird that there's (19:00 - 19:05)
not who's that Pokemon or something of (19:03 - 19:06)
this (19:05 - 19:10)
sort I don't know (19:06 - 19:10)
um for me this anime felt like an (19:11 - 19:19)
anime yes exactly and I I I don't know (19:15 - 19:21)
how to I don't know how to describe that (19:19 - 19:24)
that needs actual explanation from both (19:21 - 19:25)
of (19:24 - 19:28)
you all right hold on Hannah hold your (19:25 - 19:30)
thoughts or you form a better thought (19:28 - 19:34)
than I am about to form you do (19:30 - 19:37)
that I would say old here and I think (19:34 - 19:39)
Greg can relate to this I don't think (19:37 - 19:42)
old Pokemon ever felt like an anime I (19:39 - 19:46)
felt like old Pokemon felt like (19:42 - 19:46)
scoobydoo Scooby-Doo was Monster bad guy (19:48 - 19:55)
of the week Pokemon was very much like (19:52 - 19:57)
which Pokemon are we going to find this (19:55 - 20:00)
week and help solve that problem and you (19:57 - 20:02)
could pick any episode of Scooby-Doo you (20:00 - 20:05)
could pick any episode of Pokemon and (20:02 - 20:07)
understand the gist of it just be (20:05 - 20:10)
completely okay with like okay this week (20:07 - 20:14)
There's a Heracross it got stuck it (20:10 - 20:16)
sucked the nectar out of a Bulbasaur (20:14 - 20:18)
problem solved we'll move on to next (20:16 - 20:22)
week this okay this week There's a Wim (20:18 - 20:25)
pod he's scared we solved his he's no (20:22 - 20:28)
longer scared he he got over his fears (20:25 - 20:30)
and now he's a scary golisopod episode (20:28 - 20:33)
done you're good there are of course (20:30 - 20:34)
some episodes of the Pokemon anime where (20:33 - 20:37)
they do leave a cliffhanger and stuff (20:34 - 20:39)
but every episode of Horizons is (20:37 - 20:41)
literally like an anime Cliffhanger of (20:39 - 20:43)
like there's like two episodes I think (20:41 - 20:45)
like that kind of end like okay we could (20:43 - 20:48)
stop here this is well let's say so (20:45 - 20:51)
far we so (20:48 - 20:54)
far what's a long series of filler and (20:51 - 20:55)
if there's anything we want to talk (20:54 - 20:57)
about with anime is they love their (20:55 - 20:59)
Filler episodes (20:57 - 21:01)
I understand that you're saying it has (20:59 - 21:05)
the First episodes have lean into the (21:01 - 21:09)
overarching storyline more than a lot of (21:05 - 21:13)
the first seasons of Pokemon ever did (21:09 - 21:17)
because the it was like okay well if we (21:13 - 21:20)
just did eight gyms and the elite four (21:17 - 21:24)
that's a 12 that's just 12 episodes and (21:20 - 21:27)
we need to get 42 out of this so we're (21:24 - 21:30)
gonna have to pack it in but like if you (21:27 - 21:36)
go into later and like later parts of (21:30 - 21:38)
Pokemon the anime where they do have an (21:36 - 21:41)
overarching thing they do sometimes do (21:38 - 21:43)
that I think this is leaning a little (21:41 - 21:49)
bit more that way um but it's that's I (21:43 - 21:52)
think it's real early to it is kind of (21:49 - 21:54)
early to say it's a little (21:52 - 21:56)
early but I do think that it's helped by (21:54 - 21:58)
the fact that a lot of people are (21:56 - 22:00)
streaming this and that a lot of people (21:58 - 22:02)
aren't watching it on live TV that (22:00 - 22:05)
they're more maybe more open to doing (22:02 - 22:08)
something that is an actual storyline (22:05 - 22:10)
than just doing a monster of the week (22:08 - 22:13)
type of thing which some anime are (22:10 - 22:16)
monster of the week that's never quite (22:13 - 22:19)
been my thing um so Star Trek was very (22:16 - 22:21)
much monster of the week at a certain (22:19 - 22:24)
point back in the day a lot a lot of TV (22:21 - 22:27)
shows when you have to fill 24 episodes (22:24 - 22:28)
you're going to be like well we a plot (22:27 - 22:31)
line that'll last four what else are we (22:28 - 22:34)
going to do and when it's on a TV once a (22:31 - 22:36)
week every week and somebody new could (22:34 - 22:37)
be picking it up every week you kind of (22:36 - 22:39)
have to have the basics of every (22:37 - 22:42)
character in every episode yeah but with (22:39 - 22:44)
streaming you don't have to do that (22:42 - 22:46)
quite as much anymore that's one of the (22:44 - 22:49)
reasons I think that we're getting more (22:46 - 22:51)
story here I mean TV watching has (22:49 - 22:52)
changed (22:51 - 22:55)
drastically um (22:52 - 22:59)
and how things are approved for TV have (22:55 - 23:01)
trained drastically I I don't say (22:59 - 23:05)
necessarily that Pokemon has this (23:01 - 23:06)
problem where they have to prove (23:05 - 23:08)
themselves in only 13 episodes to see if (23:06 - 23:10)
they're getting picked up like Pokemon (23:08 - 23:13)
is going to last forever long as they we (23:10 - 23:14)
going to get 12 more episodes of (23:13 - 23:17)
Horizons I don't know yeah I don't know (23:14 - 23:19)
but I think they have to match what is (23:17 - 23:23)
happening currently in how entertainment (23:19 - 23:27)
is run so most shows where they used to (23:23 - 23:30)
get 26 episodes are now almost always (23:27 - 23:33)
only ever approved for 13 and they have (23:30 - 23:36)
to pce their plot in those 13 episodes (23:33 - 23:40)
to get enough interest to maybe get (23:36 - 23:42)
continued and that is how we are used to (23:40 - 23:46)
watching TV shows now whether it's on TV (23:42 - 23:50)
itself or in streaming because if you (23:46 - 23:51)
watch things on Hulu that are week by (23:50 - 23:54)
week it does the same structure right (23:51 - 23:57)
like this is just how media has changed (23:54 - 24:01)
to me whatever they've decided demand is (23:57 - 24:02)
so I (24:01 - 24:05)
don't I don't know that this path is (24:02 - 24:08)
going to last I don't know that we are (24:05 - 24:10)
going to have a fullon drive every (24:08 - 24:12)
episode driving towards this one (24:10 - 24:14)
plotline because they do have a much (24:12 - 24:18)
longer Arc that already exists but they (24:14 - 24:24)
can't sort of ignore how media Works (24:18 - 24:24)
currently I I'm not sure I would agree (24:24 - 24:29)
with all of that even the show that are (24:27 - 24:32)
week by week on Hulu or or even Netflix (24:29 - 24:34)
or anything like that you can still go (24:32 - 24:37)
and binge watch all the episodes that (24:34 - 24:38)
come before that and so that means that (24:37 - 24:40)
they're not really episodic in the same (24:38 - 24:42)
way that they used to be and I would say (24:40 - 24:45)
that even today the trend is more (24:42 - 24:48)
towards six to eight episodes than 12 or (24:45 - 24:51)
13 and I'm really glad that I'm really (24:48 - 24:53)
glad that Horizons isn't yeah I mean (24:51 - 24:55)
they they've dropped it again which is (24:53 - 24:57)
unfortunate I don't like the six to (24:55 - 25:00)
eight episodes feels too short for it (24:57 - 25:02)
almost any season of show I mean they (25:00 - 25:04)
just they keep chopping it down which is (25:02 - 25:07)
a bad Trend in television (25:04 - 25:10)
creation uh as a bad Trend in general (25:07 - 25:12)
entertainment creation where they just (25:10 - 25:14)
keep chopping down how much you get (25:12 - 25:17)
before you're approved again um and I (25:14 - 25:19)
could go off about why they do that and (25:17 - 25:22)
the money that they quote unquote save (25:19 - 25:23)
but (25:22 - 25:27)
um I (25:23 - 25:29)
think (25:27 - 25:32)
I don't see how (25:29 - 25:38)
given sort of the the general deepness (25:32 - 25:40)
of what these what the central mystery (25:38 - 25:42)
is that there aren't going to have to be (25:40 - 25:45)
Filler episodes I mean there already are (25:42 - 25:47)
Filler episodes like they're going to (25:45 - 25:49)
have to start filling some stuff in (25:47 - 25:51)
because otherwise they (25:49 - 25:53)
can (25:51 - 25:56)
filler uh there are parts of the (25:53 - 25:59)
episodes that feel like filler less than (25:56 - 26:02)
just geared towards the story 100% of (25:59 - 26:03)
the time there's always going to be (26:02 - 26:05)
straying off the path (26:03 - 26:08)
some that's not a bad thing I guess I (26:05 - 26:09)
guess you guys didn't finish but like (26:08 - 26:11)
there there are there are two at the end (26:09 - 26:14)
of 12 episodes there are two plot points (26:11 - 26:17)
not one they they they they add like two (26:14 - 26:20)
missions like Leo has her Mission and (26:17 - 26:22)
then Roy has his mission and they they (26:20 - 26:24)
really like lay that out at the end of (26:22 - 26:27)
the 12 episodes and like they do a good (26:24 - 26:29)
job at saying like (26:27 - 26:32)
here your 12 episodes are done now you (26:29 - 26:33)
kind of know what's going forward for (26:32 - 26:37)
the next 12 which again has been out in (26:33 - 26:40)
Japan for a while yeah so H and I'm (26:37 - 26:43)
assuming because there are some things (26:40 - 26:46)
in the first 12 that they don't answer (26:43 - 26:48)
which I thought like oh okay like this (26:46 - 26:50)
door is going to open and we're going to (26:48 - 26:52)
get answers here and that door never (26:50 - 26:55)
opens um and so I'm assuming once that (26:52 - 26:56)
door (26:55 - 26:58)
opens that could be literally or fig (26:56 - 27:01)
figuratively once that door opens there (26:58 - 27:04)
there there is a there's probably a (27:01 - 27:08)
third overarching task SLG goal that (27:04 - 27:11)
needs to happen I am curious in the long (27:08 - 27:13)
term of things because I've I've tried (27:11 - 27:16)
my best in the last year to avoid (27:13 - 27:20)
spoilers and like to not look at uh (27:16 - 27:23)
anime Twitter or or anime threads or or (27:20 - 27:24)
like cuz people get really excited about (27:23 - 27:26)
the Pokemon I get it people get super (27:24 - 27:28)
excited they post they're like oh my God (27:26 - 27:30)
Pok introduced this trainer is here this (27:28 - 27:32)
gym leader is here totally get the (27:30 - 27:34)
excitement around it very hard as (27:32 - 27:36)
somebody who reports on Pokemon news to (27:34 - 27:39)
avoid all of that for the last year but (27:36 - 27:41)
I I guess the question that pops in my (27:39 - 27:44)
head is like does Leo and Roy and (27:41 - 27:46)
whoever else decides to join them (27:44 - 27:50)
there's no way this is a 25 year old 25y (27:46 - 27:52)
old story like is this going to last a (27:50 - 27:54)
year is this going to last two years are (27:52 - 27:58)
they going to new characters um is are (27:54 - 28:01)
they doing a thing where like Horizons (27:58 - 28:04)
is going to represent three years of (28:01 - 28:06)
scarlet and VI yeah scarlet and violet I (28:04 - 28:07)
was like what game are we (28:06 - 28:10)
on and then are they going to switch (28:07 - 28:11)
other characters like there there's so (28:10 - 28:15)
many questions cuz we we were used to (28:11 - 28:18)
just ash being this filler not like (28:15 - 28:21)
literal filler but like ash was always (28:18 - 28:23)
there he was just always it was always (28:21 - 28:25)
Ash it was yeah right so like there was (28:23 - 28:28)
there was never any questions it was and (28:25 - 28:29)
way are coming out cool Ash is going to (28:28 - 28:31)
Unova X and Y is coming out cool Ash is (28:29 - 28:35)
going to Kow like there was never any (28:31 - 28:37)
doubt in people's mind that this was (28:35 - 28:39)
just like what was going to happen with (28:37 - 28:42)
the anime yeah because like is I think (28:39 - 28:44)
Diamond and Pearl was (28:42 - 28:48)
four I think it was Four Seasons before (28:44 - 28:51)
Ash went to a different region because I (28:48 - 28:53)
just had to rewatch (28:51 - 28:56)
those kanta (28:53 - 28:58)
was it feels like l cuz like the first (28:56 - 29:02)
episode of can was like 78,000 (28:58 - 29:05)
episodes also if we were doing the (29:02 - 29:09)
pacing of indigo League (29:05 - 29:13)
right uh because they go from Kanto in (29:09 - 29:16)
in Horizons they go from Kanto to Pala (29:13 - 29:19)
in less than 12 episodes if this was if (29:16 - 29:20)
this was Indigo League that would have (29:19 - 29:24)
been like 48 episodes it takes Ash so (29:20 - 29:27)
long to get from one gym to the other (29:24 - 29:28)
and I get they're on an Airship they're (29:27 - 29:32)
not walking Ash was walking but but also (29:28 - 29:35)
like if I think about (29:32 - 29:38)
Journeys that almost felt like (29:35 - 29:41)
unrealistic pacing like you would start (29:38 - 29:43)
the episode and Ash and go would be like (29:41 - 29:47)
we're going to hoen today and like their (29:43 - 29:49)
Bas is out of well okay the hen was a (29:47 - 29:51)
bad example be like we're going to alola (29:49 - 29:54)
today and their bases out of Kanto and (29:51 - 29:55)
then they would just be there and at the (29:54 - 29:58)
end of the episode they would be back (29:55 - 30:00)
they're jet Setters they're just all (29:58 - 30:02)
over the place all over the time one (30:00 - 30:05)
complaint about Journeys is how small (30:02 - 30:08)
they made the world (30:05 - 30:11)
feel um but joury also to me felt very (30:08 - 30:14)
Scooby-Doo of like we went to this area (30:11 - 30:15)
and now we're back at home at the very (30:14 - 30:19)
end yeah I mean that it was very much uh (30:15 - 30:24)
tells single stories in the entire world (30:19 - 30:29)
uh instead of like one overarching plot (30:24 - 30:32)
go kind of had an overarching plot but (30:29 - 30:35)
they hit on it so rarely it was like (30:32 - 30:37)
every fourth episode it was like oh go (30:35 - 30:39)
remember you're doing that thing once (30:37 - 30:41)
every 10 episodes even yeah hey but he (30:39 - 30:44)
caught a lot of Pokemon he did every (30:41 - 30:46)
episode he just whipped pokeballs left (30:44 - 30:49)
and right how many seasons was Journeys (30:46 - 30:51)
was that also (30:49 - 30:56)
four uh it was three plus the 10 episode (30:51 - 30:58)
goodbye thing so (30:56 - 31:01)
Tech yeah technically four I was looking (30:58 - 31:03)
at this last night cuz I was like What (31:01 - 31:05)
if I just cuz I still never watched the (31:03 - 31:07)
like 10 good bu episodes for what you (31:05 - 31:09)
haven't even watched the sui in snow yet (31:07 - 31:12)
either and that's even easier to watch I (31:09 - 31:14)
watched all 12 episodes of Horizon's (31:12 - 31:17)
last night in preparation I liked it I (31:14 - 31:19)
liked it a (31:17 - 31:22)
lot I I liked it so much that I'm like (31:19 - 31:24)
what if I try to find the other English (31:22 - 31:26)
episodes that exist I was like n I'll (31:24 - 31:28)
just wait but we don't just wait just (31:26 - 31:30)
wait till next year when it finally (31:28 - 31:31)
comes out on Netflix again but they (31:30 - 31:33)
didn't even say what the schedule is (31:31 - 31:35)
like we're just assuming it's every 3 (31:33 - 31:36)
months because that's what they did with (31:35 - 31:38)
Journeys but we have no clue what the (31:36 - 31:41)
schedule's oh also again I was I was at (31:38 - 31:44)
New York I did ask I was like (31:41 - 31:47)
hey why did this get pushed back why did (31:44 - 31:49)
this wait so long (31:47 - 31:52)
and my the answer I was given was a (31:49 - 31:54)
little generic but it was (31:52 - 31:56)
like (31:54 - 31:59)
Netflix (31:56 - 31:59)
uh (31:59 - 32:03)
Netflix sounds about right yeah (31:59 - 32:10)
so um yeah I take that for what it's (32:03 - 32:10)
worth I'm not saying it wasn't (32:10 - 32:14)
completely the Pokemon company's fault (32:12 - 32:15)
but it sounded (32:14 - 32:18)
like yeah you know Netflix kind of (32:15 - 32:20)
pushed some things (32:18 - 32:24)
around so I don't know okay uh before we (32:20 - 32:29)
go to break uh this was off um (32:24 - 32:31)
this was pulled from this is off anime (32:29 - 32:33)
Mojo but it was pulled from variety but (32:31 - 32:35)
it was pulled from tunando it doesn't (32:33 - 32:38)
matter we're just doing the quote here (32:35 - 32:40)
uh there was an interview with Pokemon (32:38 - 32:42)
company International Executives Andy (32:40 - 32:45)
ghost Andy goose who is the senior (32:42 - 32:49)
director of media production and Tao uh (32:45 - 32:52)
coru I can't say their last name (32:49 - 32:56)
Hannah uh looking for it in the (32:52 - 32:59)
article it's between between all the ads (32:56 - 33:01)
between all the ads there are a lot of (32:59 - 33:05)
ads there are a lot of ads EXA (33:01 - 33:07)
exactly it's like right before the (33:05 - 33:09)
bolded part there are also a lot of (33:07 - 33:16)
bolded Parts uh ah ta OK okuda Oka yeah (33:09 - 33:17)
that's why we have hand on the show uh (33:16 - 33:19)
they are the vice president of marketing (33:17 - 33:23)
for Pokemon and the first quote is Ash (33:19 - 33:25)
and Pikachu have had a fantastic run (33:23 - 33:27)
they're so iconic and they've been been (33:25 - 33:30)
an entry point for so many folks into (33:27 - 33:32)
the brand over the years we've gotten (33:30 - 33:34)
the multi-generational effect where (33:32 - 33:35)
folks have grown up with them and (33:34 - 33:36)
they're sharing with their kids nephews (33:35 - 33:39)
and nieces end (33:36 - 33:42)
quote uh new quote here is we've grown (33:39 - 33:44)
up with them and it feels like there's (33:42 - 33:45)
more to the world and more characters to (33:44 - 33:50)
explore so in so 28 years in it feels (33:45 - 33:51)
like why not meet some new folks in the (33:50 - 33:53)
world and experience the ventures of (33:51 - 33:56)
Pokemon through a different (33:53 - 33:58)
lens and then (33:56 - 34:02)
and so that was from senior director of (33:58 - 34:04)
media production for the Pokemon company (34:02 - 34:08)
and then Tio quotes Pokemon kind of has (34:04 - 34:10)
a mandate we evolve I'm personally (34:08 - 34:12)
passionate about Ash and Pikachu but (34:10 - 34:14)
that being said after 28 years of (34:12 - 34:16)
Pokemon has been evolving in multiple (34:14 - 34:18)
forms including the video game trading (34:16 - 34:20)
card game and other games now there will (34:18 - 34:23)
be a possib possible opportunity for the (34:20 - 34:24)
animation field to evolve we're very (34:23 - 34:26)
excited to have the introduction of new (34:24 - 34:30)
protagonist especially a female (34:26 - 34:30)
pagonis um and then they went back to (34:31 - 34:36)
ghost (34:33 - 34:39)
Goose uh and then he says quote we said (34:36 - 34:42)
farewell uh Ash is still in the world (34:39 - 34:44)
anything is possible I suppose in the (34:42 - 34:45)
world of Pokemon there are so many (34:44 - 34:47)
possibilities end (34:45 - 34:50)
quote um and then finally the final (34:47 - 34:53)
quote here (34:50 - 34:53)
from (34:54 - 34:59)
uh yes uh (34:55 - 35:02)
is we hope Ash and Pikachu continue (34:59 - 35:04)
their Journey their journey is going (35:02 - 35:05)
somewhere in the world of Pokemon it's (35:04 - 35:07)
totally up to fans imaginations for the (35:05 - 35:09)
time being we would love to focus on the (35:07 - 35:12)
new story of Leo and Roy uh Horizons (35:09 - 35:14)
invites A New (35:12 - 35:17)
Beginning until so I to reup that (35:14 - 35:19)
copyright and then ashle comes screaming (35:17 - 35:22)
back until anything as possible and Ash (35:19 - 35:23)
shows up for an (35:22 - 35:26)
episode oh there's no doubt he will yeah (35:23 - 35:28)
for sure (35:26 - 35:31)
I I there was gosh on this show on on (35:28 - 35:33)
social media of people thinking for a (35:31 - 35:35)
very long time that Ash would be like (35:33 - 35:38)
Leo's dad or something of the sort you (35:35 - 35:41)
do meet Leo's dad for the record and (35:38 - 35:43)
it's not Ash it's not Ash are we sure (35:41 - 35:46)
it's that Ash in (35:43 - 35:50)
Disguise I think like I don't know why (35:46 - 35:53)
people were so upset that Ash never aged (35:50 - 35:55)
because there's lots of TV shows where (35:53 - 35:58)
characters don't age (35:55 - 36:00)
um and then there are TV shows where (35:58 - 36:02)
they do Age characters and then it it (36:00 - 36:04)
it's not any (36:02 - 36:06)
better (36:04 - 36:11)
but we we we do meet gym leaders like uh (36:06 - 36:13)
like there was a big announcement that (36:11 - 36:15)
eono would eventually be in the anime I (36:13 - 36:17)
think she is in the anime for Japan (36:15 - 36:19)
already I don't know how many episodes (36:17 - 36:21)
it takes for iono to show up they made a (36:19 - 36:22)
big deal about that very hard to avoid (36:21 - 36:24)
that so we know iono is in the anime at (36:22 - 36:26)
some point she's not in the first 12 (36:24 - 36:28)
episodes so sorry to anyone hoping that (36:26 - 36:31)
she would appear um but I think there's (36:28 - 36:33)
like an older gym (36:31 - 36:35)
leader and I feel like I know who that (36:33 - 36:37)
is I don't want to spoil it for anyone (36:35 - 36:39)
they go they do see an older gym leader (36:37 - 36:42)
so it would be very weird where if in (36:39 - 36:45)
your mind you're like well maybe Ash is (36:42 - 36:48)
now 20 instead of 10 and Leo is (36:45 - 36:51)
14 if you were to age Ash you have to (36:48 - 36:53)
age all these gym leaders and then all (36:51 - 36:54)
of a (36:53 - 36:57)
sudden like I get that that they're (36:54 - 36:58)
definitely like flashbacks like we've (36:57 - 37:00)
seen Professor Oak when he was like 10 (36:58 - 37:02)
years old in like the celab movie like I (37:00 - 37:04)
totally get that but like in your in (37:02 - 37:06)
your Pokemon (37:04 - 37:09)
world you're everyone's kind of just the (37:06 - 37:11)
same because they all just exist and (37:09 - 37:12)
they keep adding more characters Pokemon (37:11 - 37:14)
Masters would probably be like yes give (37:12 - 37:19)
us older older yeah we need more polls (37:14 - 37:21)
for these (37:19 - 37:24)
characters like I guess technically like (37:21 - 37:26)
everything in uh somebody's going to I (37:24 - 37:29)
know I already can see the comments like (37:26 - 37:31)
technically gold and silver are two (37:29 - 37:34)
years in the future and like technically (37:31 - 37:36)
like red and blue appear at the end of (37:34 - 37:37)
sun and moon and they're like slightly (37:36 - 37:41)
older as well but also like all of that (37:37 - 37:42)
got thrown out the window with Omega (37:41 - 37:44)
Ruby Alpha Sapphire because they're like (37:42 - 37:46)
ah (37:44 - 37:50)
multiverses yeah multiverses (37:46 - 37:50)
exist so there are some that are direct (37:50 - 37:56)
sequels like we know Johto happens after (37:53 - 37:59)
Kanto we know Black and White 2 happen (37:56 - 38:01)
after black and white cuz time wait hold (37:59 - 38:03)
on Black and White 2 happens after black (38:01 - 38:07)
and white yeah it does happen to we know (38:03 - 38:10)
that Omega Ruby Alpha sappur happens (38:07 - 38:12)
before X and (38:10 - 38:15)
Y I guess we know that technically the (38:12 - 38:17)
sun and moon anime happens before the (38:15 - 38:20)
games because they're not trial leaders (38:17 - 38:23)
yet like there there is like some leeway (38:20 - 38:25)
they have they have a wild timeline that (38:23 - 38:27)
I don't think anybody's paying any (38:25 - 38:28)
attention (38:27 - 38:31)
to some people are paying attention to (38:28 - 38:32)
it (38:31 - 38:38)
D really throws off a lot (38:32 - 38:38)
yeah (38:39 - 38:44)
um I yeah I I totally get why they (38:41 - 38:46)
wouldn't also bring Ash back in like the (38:44 - 38:48)
first year or two because they don't (38:46 - 38:50)
want to take away from these new (38:48 - 38:53)
characters this is a 30th Anniversary (38:50 - 38:57)
thing like let's like as there's no way (38:53 - 38:59)
Ash is not making any appearance in the (38:57 - 39:01)
30th anniversary (38:59 - 39:05)
year that is like the most easily (39:01 - 39:08)
predictable thing I think we can make on (39:05 - 39:10)
this show is that the 30th Anniversary (39:08 - 39:12)
Ash and Pikachu are coming back they're (39:10 - 39:14)
going to be a banner and Masters again (39:12 - 39:15)
so you have to wait a number of years (39:14 - 39:17)
for that they're going to show up at a (39:15 - 39:19)
bunch of different games like ash is (39:17 - 39:22)
coming back for the 30th let's be real (39:19 - 39:24)
uh speaking of Pikachu I know we said we (39:22 - 39:25)
were going to take a break we didn't (39:24 - 39:27)
talk about fre and Pikachu at all (39:25 - 39:29)
which I I think are my two favorite (39:27 - 39:31)
characters and I think they did a really (39:29 - 39:34)
really good job at making captain (39:31 - 39:38)
Pikachu different than Ash's Pikachu (39:34 - 39:40)
yeah he punches totally different (39:38 - 39:44)
characters he punches instead of bolts (39:40 - 39:47)
what what else that's it he punches (39:44 - 39:49)
instead of bolts there's there there's (39:47 - 39:52)
just something about Captain Pikachu (39:49 - 39:55)
that they just did such a good job (39:52 - 39:57)
obviously Pikachu can only say Pikachu (39:55 - 39:59)
but even different (39:57 - 40:02)
voice with his limited (39:59 - 40:04)
vocabulary they there's just something (40:02 - 40:07)
about him like the confidence the the (40:04 - 40:10)
the the captain of Captain Pikachu that (40:07 - 40:13)
they did such a a good job (40:10 - 40:16)
with um I can't get over how he's just (40:13 - 40:19)
called CAP all the time as someone who (40:16 - 40:21)
did watch a bunch of Marvel movies and (40:19 - 40:24)
my only my only mental image of anything (40:21 - 40:27)
being called CAP is Captain America (40:24 - 40:28)
now it's (40:27 - 40:32)
Pikachu there you go move over Marvel (40:28 - 40:37)
yeah there's a new sheriff in (40:32 - 40:37)
town boat captain in town um okay so (40:38 - 40:45)
hopefully hopefully (40:43 - 40:47)
we I don't know I feel like it I feel (40:45 - 40:49)
like either people started Horizons (40:47 - 40:50)
because they were excited this past (40:49 - 40:53)
weekend or they just don't care maybe if (40:50 - 40:55)
you didn't care the last 40 minutes (40:53 - 40:57)
maybe convinced you to start I think (40:55 - 40:57)
it's (40:57 - 40:59)
cool (40:57 - 41:04)
um but I don't know I I liked it a lot (40:59 - 41:06)
so uh we'll take a break when we come (41:04 - 41:10)
back we got some more Pokemon news so we (41:06 - 41:13)
will be right back and we are back from (41:10 - 41:15)
our (41:13 - 41:18)
break uh if you're listening to this (41:15 - 41:22)
right now uh the on Monday the Seven (41:18 - 41:25)
Star Blastoise are still active until (41:22 - 41:27)
Tuesday (41:25 - 41:30)
evening afternoon I don't know does it (41:27 - 41:31)
go forward or backwards with Daylight (41:30 - 41:34)
Savings Time how does this forward (41:31 - 41:37)
fallback we sprung forward hopefully for (41:34 - 41:39)
the last time ever please just end this (41:37 - 41:42)
Daylight Savings Time nightmare it is (41:39 - 41:45)
the worst and it it never made sense it (41:42 - 41:48)
doesn't make sense now it's just (41:45 - 41:53)
dumb so blasto should leave at 7 p.m. (41:48 - 41:55)
then central (41:53 - 41:59)
time if if if Venusaur left at 6 I think (41:55 - 42:02)
so because that's what it was before the (41:59 - 42:04)
time change yeah if you are confused (42:02 - 42:05)
about time change right now and you have (42:04 - 42:08)
not done Blastoise pull over in your car (42:05 - 42:11)
connect your phone to fire up to your (42:08 - 42:15)
switch make a hot spot and do Blastoise (42:11 - 42:17)
as soon as possible uh I did make a (42:15 - 42:19)
guide on (42:17 - 42:21)
Blastoise uh and there's Pokemon that (42:19 - 42:23)
you can use for Blastoise if you need (42:21 - 42:25)
help uh the Discord can help you the (42:23 - 42:27)
slack can help you if you're either of (42:25 - 42:29)
those um but then Charizard will go in (42:27 - 42:32)
rotation on Tuesday evening and that (42:29 - 42:34)
will only last till Sunday so Charizard (42:32 - 42:38)
will not be a full week it will it will (42:34 - 42:39)
five days I think Tuesday to Sunday is (42:38 - 42:42)
five days this is the first time they're (42:39 - 42:45)
repeating a seven star raid um we have (42:42 - 42:48)
no clue if Charizard is going to be (42:45 - 42:50)
exactly the same I think the the website (42:48 - 42:52)
kind of says it's going to be the same (42:50 - 42:54)
but they could activate the shield a (42:52 - 42:57)
little bit earlier because they wouldn't (42:54 - 43:00)
they wouldn't say that anyways (42:57 - 43:04)
yeah um so if you're basing it off the (43:00 - 43:07)
the same like move set and stuff uh I'm (43:04 - 43:09)
going to actually have like I think four (43:07 - 43:11)
or five new Pokemon I'm not sure if this (43:09 - 43:13)
video goes up if the my Charizard guide (43:11 - 43:15)
will be out but there's better poke (43:13 - 43:17)
better Pokemon have exist exist now like (43:15 - 43:20)
there are still some good ones but like (43:17 - 43:22)
we know the power of acid spray we have (43:20 - 43:24)
a Pokemon uh called elemy who is very (43:22 - 43:26)
good here that can decorate and just (43:24 - 43:29)
make the raids go much much faster if it (43:26 - 43:31)
is exactly the same so uh I'll have (43:29 - 43:33)
those Pokemon put up and if you miss (43:31 - 43:35)
Charizard for the first time which I (43:33 - 43:37)
think is a lot of people remember you (43:35 - 43:39)
had to like you had to beat the game you (43:37 - 43:42)
had to unlock six-star raids you had to (43:39 - 43:45)
do a lot in what like two weeks of that (43:42 - 43:46)
game coming out in order to like (43:45 - 43:48)
challenge (43:46 - 43:51)
Charizard uh and that was all before (43:48 - 43:54)
Christmas and we've had two Christmases (43:51 - 43:58)
with this game now so I think a lot of (43:54 - 43:59)
people because it came out in November (43:58 - 44:02)
that was Christmas then the DLC that was (43:59 - 44:06)
Christmas yes so a lot of people get (44:02 - 44:07)
games for (44:06 - 44:09)
Christmas I'm assuming a lot of people (44:07 - 44:11)
Miss (44:09 - 44:11)
Charizard so (44:12 - 44:17)
uh and even though they said the rate is (44:15 - 44:20)
going to be exactly the same is it going (44:17 - 44:22)
to drop Urban mystica because that's not (44:20 - 44:23)
exactly the (44:22 - 44:26)
same yeah like CH changing the entire (44:23 - 44:28)
loot table is is not the same so that's (44:26 - 44:30)
why I'm like it'll probably be mostly (44:28 - 44:32)
the same but I can see them changing the (44:30 - 44:34)
loot table and maybe how the shield (44:32 - 44:37)
works and maybe they they they remove (44:34 - 44:38)
because he has (44:37 - 44:42)
like Terra Blast and dragon pulse and (44:38 - 44:44)
they literally do the same damage they (44:42 - 44:46)
do the same thing there's no reason for (44:44 - 44:48)
him to have both (44:46 - 44:50)
like Charizard is one of the very few (44:48 - 44:52)
Pokemon that had eight moves but it (44:50 - 44:54)
didn't really benefit he has also like (44:52 - 44:55)
three fire moves I think he has like (44:54 - 44:58)
Inferno over heat and flamethrower and (44:55 - 45:00)
they kind of stopped like doing (44:58 - 45:02)
that you could tell over the the last (45:00 - 45:06)
year they've like gotten better gotten (45:02 - 45:08)
better at like how to build the (45:06 - 45:10)
sevenstar Pokemon Charizard they're like (45:08 - 45:12)
let's just give them as many moves as (45:10 - 45:15)
possible we'll figure it (45:12 - 45:18)
out so um I'll be helping with Charizard (45:15 - 45:20)
if you need Charizard if you've already (45:18 - 45:22)
caught a Charizard you cannot catch (45:20 - 45:24)
another but if it again if it's the (45:22 - 45:27)
urban mystica thing and (45:24 - 45:29)
everyone's using fairy Pokemon Charizard (45:27 - 45:33)
might be the best way to get herb (45:29 - 45:35)
mystica uh because Venusaur did the (45:33 - 45:36)
really annoying thing of increasing its (45:35 - 45:39)
special defense Blastoise did the very (45:36 - 45:41)
annoying thing of decreas increasing its (45:39 - 45:43)
physical defense and Charizard didn't (45:41 - 45:46)
have well Charizard increases its attack (45:43 - 45:49)
with sunny day because of its ability (45:46 - 45:52)
solar power so that can be annoying for (45:49 - 45:55)
sure Charizard why I did the dash (45:52 - 45:58)
Bund yes a lot of people did dashb and (45:55 - 46:00)
that was like everyone put ability (45:58 - 46:01)
shields on their Pokemon cuz they (46:00 - 46:03)
thought that mattered but it only (46:01 - 46:06)
matters for one (46:03 - 46:08)
turn you could just heal cheer or (46:06 - 46:10)
defense cheer that turn and you'd be (46:08 - 46:13)
fine um we've learned a lot from Seven (46:10 - 46:15)
Star raids in the in the (46:13 - 46:19)
past year and four (46:15 - 46:21)
months um so yeah Charizard should be (46:19 - 46:24)
Tuesday night your this is just your (46:21 - 46:26)
warning call to do your Blastoise cuz we (46:24 - 46:28)
have no clue when Blastoise and Venusaur (46:26 - 46:31)
if they are ever going to come back (46:28 - 46:36)
so some more scarlet and violet news (46:31 - 46:38)
Toyota it's a real small Japanese (46:36 - 46:41)
company (46:38 - 46:41)
uh hey they made a real life maridon (46:42 - 46:48)
motorcycle (46:46 - 46:52)
yeah I'm willing to risk my life in a (46:48 - 46:55)
vehicle that has a 100% accident rate (46:52 - 46:58)
just to be (46:55 - 46:58)
cool members of the Toyota engineering (46:58 - 47:03)
Society an organization of Toyota (47:01 - 47:06)
employees created to enhance their (47:03 - 47:08)
technical skills and talents of its (47:06 - 47:10)
members decided to take on the crazy (47:08 - 47:13)
task of bringing a ridable maridon into (47:10 - 47:15)
the real world as you can see of these (47:13 - 47:18)
images we'll have this in our show notes (47:15 - 47:20)
um this is off go Nintendo uh they've (47:18 - 47:24)
already cooked up a pretty impressive (47:20 - 47:26)
prototype uh obviously this is not (47:24 - 47:29)
production that Toyota will Mass produce (47:26 - 47:31)
it is a project for the to Toyota in (47:29 - 47:35)
engineering Society (47:31 - 47:37)
uh (47:35 - 47:41)
and it it's it's definitely a real life (47:37 - 47:45)
maridon motorcycle it looks neat I don't (47:41 - 47:48)
really understand how the wheels work (47:45 - 47:51)
but it looks (47:48 - 47:54)
cool yeah I I I don't know how the (47:51 - 47:56)
wheels are structured either I I think (47:54 - 47:58)
it would be more impressive when we saw (47:56 - 48:00)
it driving but we've only just seen it (47:58 - 48:02)
yeah we only seen the Ste shots of it (48:00 - 48:05)
yeah the eyes light up though MH yeah it (48:02 - 48:08)
looks cool hopefully we get more of this (48:05 - 48:10)
because I just think this is really neat (48:08 - 48:12)
also like they don't say nor could I (48:10 - 48:15)
find like how much involvement the (48:12 - 48:19)

permission obviously to just they're not (48:28 - 48:32)
sell something right CU they're not (48:31 - 48:34)
selling it (48:32 - 48:36)

X is 10 so Super Bowl 60 yeah yep 60 (50:10 - 50:17)
yeah anytime I think of like the numbers (50:15 - 50:18)
I think WrestleMania because that's the (50:17 - 50:19)
thing I actually watch and I think (50:18 - 50:22)
WrestleMania is like at (50:19 - 50:25)
40 Super Bowl's at like 60 that's a lot (50:22 - 50:27)
anyways it's a lot (50:25 - 50:29)
um there's a lot to unpack here number (50:27 - 50:32)
one I don't think the Pokemon company's (50:29 - 50:35)
very happy about them revealing the 2026 (50:32 - 50:39)
venue yeah that's crazy nope that's (50:35 - 50:43)
absolutely insane that just like some (50:39 - 50:45)
casual conversation with a reporter of (50:43 - 50:47)
like hey which events are you hosting (50:45 - 50:49)
and they're like oh boy we got that (50:47 - 50:51)
Pokemon thing coming in (50:49 - 50:54)
2026 I don't think that was supposed to (50:51 - 50:56)
happen I (50:54 - 50:58)
the Pokemon company has said nothing (50:56 - 51:02)
about this which is probably like any (50:58 - 51:05)
sort of like yeah it's probably true (51:02 - 51:06)
like why also why would they lie about (51:05 - 51:09)
that why would (51:06 - 51:12)
conven I mean well also we know how far (51:09 - 51:15)
in advance they make these (51:12 - 51:17)
contracts yeah that's okay that's the (51:15 - 51:19)
news I wanted to talk about because I I (51:17 - 51:20)
totally understand why people are mad (51:19 - 51:23)
about Hawaii totally get it 100% we (51:20 - 51:24)
don't need to have this conversation for (51:23 - 51:26)
the fifth time but they would have had (51:24 - 51:30)
to book Hawaii two plus years before (51:26 - 51:33)
they announced it and it just happened (51:30 - 51:34)
like there were there was fires and (51:33 - 51:36)
everything and that's very unfortunate (51:34 - 51:38)
but (51:36 - 51:41)
like I I I think the everyday normal I (51:38 - 51:43)
want the complaint on Twitter person (51:41 - 51:46)
does not realize you just don't like (51:43 - 51:48)
casually walk into a venue and be like (51:46 - 51:51)
hey you guys free in six months it (51:48 - 51:56)
doesn't happen can you can you host this (51:51 - 52:00)
I mean if you've ever planned a (51:56 - 52:04)
wedding you know that for that you at (52:00 - 52:07)
least almost always a year out and this (52:04 - 52:10)
is a lot bigger than a wedding like you (52:07 - 52:13)
can sometimes do a (52:10 - 52:16)
wedding in a shorter amount of time but (52:13 - 52:20)
generally like standard wedding venues (52:16 - 52:23)
book up a year in advance so there's no (52:20 - 52:26)
way you're doing an enti (52:23 - 52:29)
convention yeah I mean the the fires (52:26 - 52:30)
aren't the only thing to talk about with (52:29 - 52:33)
them hosting an event in Hawaii but (52:30 - 52:35)
there's a lot clearly they plan this (52:33 - 52:38)
stuff out ahead of time yeah yeah (52:35 - 52:41)
yeah um the the Hawaii conversation is a (52:38 - 52:43)
very big conversation but it was not (52:41 - 52:46)
like the last one ended and they quickly (52:43 - 52:49)
spun around and said Hawaii gets it (52:46 - 52:50)
right right right right yeah that that (52:49 - 52:51)
that's just the point we're making it's (52:50 - 52:53)
not like they got up on stage and was (52:51 - 52:57)
like uh Hawai we picked (52:53 - 52:57)
Hawaii I mean it big events take a lot (52:58 - 53:05)
of planning I mean the Olympics the 30th (53:02 - 53:08)
Anniversary world (53:05 - 53:10)
yeah that's what we're talking about (53:08 - 53:14)
here so the other news from (53:10 - 53:17)
this is if if they're coming to San (53:14 - 53:19)
Francisco in (53:17 - 53:21)
2026 (53:19 - 53:24)
which I wasn't excited about (53:21 - 53:27)
Hawaii I'm als so not excited about San (53:24 - 53:30)
Francisco let me just be very clear (53:27 - 53:30)
here they they they picked a place for (53:31 - 53:38)
2025 but we have no clue where it is so (53:35 - 53:41)
is it going to be America three years in (53:38 - 53:44)
a row although like unfortunately (53:41 - 53:47)
for say what you will about (53:44 - 53:50)
Hawaii it's all out there but it's also (53:47 - 53:53)
just not convenient for most Americans (53:50 - 53:54)
to go (53:53 - 53:57)
to like I feel like in a scale of like I (53:54 - 54:00)
don't know it cost me like $400 to fly (53:57 - 54:03)
to uh Florida it cost me $300 to fly to (54:00 - 54:07)
New York cost me $500 to fly to La (54:03 - 54:10)
Hawaii is just expensive it's it's just (54:07 - 54:12)
more unless you got like a killer deal (54:10 - 54:14)
like Hawaii is always I feel like closer (54:12 - 54:16)
to $ thousand dollar to fly to which is (54:14 - 54:20)
oh yeah uh outside of budgets for (54:16 - 54:22)
people (54:20 - 54:24)
um (54:22 - 54:26)
and (54:24 - 54:28)
I I'm just (54:26 - 54:31)
like when you say like l or when you say (54:28 - 54:35)
San Francisco 2026 I'm like I bet 2025 (54:31 - 54:37)
is going to be really good it's probably (54:35 - 54:40)
not going to be United States (54:37 - 54:42)
but cool like what country are you (54:40 - 54:44)
picking like are you going to go back to (54:42 - 54:46)
Japan Pro probably not are you going to (54:44 - 54:49)
go to Spain because they solved their (54:46 - 54:50)
issues with Spain there was like a there (54:49 - 54:53)
was a long time where like they didn't (54:50 - 54:54)
want to go to Spain because they had (54:53 - 54:56)
some weird rules about about prizes that (54:54 - 54:59)
was that was the big hold Spain Spain (54:56 - 55:00)
has really weird rules when it comes to (54:59 - 55:02)
tournament prizing but I think they (55:00 - 55:03)
sorted that all out since there was (55:02 - 55:06)
obviously a tournament in Spain um also (55:03 - 55:10)
leads into our Pokemon Go News (55:06 - 55:13)
where they they picking Spain again for (55:10 - 55:15)
something uh so we'll get to that in a (55:13 - 55:17)
second (55:15 - 55:22)
but here here's my big problem with San (55:17 - 55:24)
Francisco uh and this this can happen in (55:22 - 55:28)
most cities but but like the the recent (55:24 - 55:29)
I and again I don't know how bad it is (55:28 - 55:32)
it could be that the media has like (55:29 - 55:35)
overblown the the problem is the the (55:32 - 55:38)
smash and grabs in San Francisco is like (55:35 - 55:40)
much higher than any other city so what (55:38 - 55:42)
happens is you fly in and if you get a (55:40 - 55:45)
rental car and you're like slowly (55:42 - 55:47)
leaving out and you like stop to get gas (55:45 - 55:49)
or stop to get snacks or or whatnot like (55:47 - 55:51)
people will smash the back of your (55:49 - 55:52)
window and pull your luggage because (55:51 - 55:54)
they know you're coming just from the (55:52 - 55:56)
airport (55:54 - 56:00)
um and the advice is always like when (55:56 - 56:02)
you get out of San Francisco directly go (56:00 - 56:04)
directly to your hotel before you make (56:02 - 56:07)
any stop any errand drop off your stuff (56:04 - 56:10)
and this is not like this can happen in (56:07 - 56:13)
any City maybe any American city I (56:10 - 56:14)
should (56:13 - 56:16)
say (56:14 - 56:20)
but but the the side note of like a (56:16 - 56:22)
Pokemon tournament is every time I go to (56:20 - 56:24)
a worlds or anytime I go to this big a (56:22 - 56:27)
big event big Pokemon event you we (56:24 - 56:30)
always report on somebody's binder was (56:27 - 56:33)
stolen and if I just think of thousands (56:30 - 56:35)
of Pokemon fans flying into San (56:33 - 56:38)
Francisco even if the media is (56:35 - 56:41)
overblowing the smash and grab stuff (56:38 - 56:43)
there will for sure be somebody's (56:41 - 56:45)
Pokemon cards getting (56:43 - 56:48)
stolen while they leave the airport (56:45 - 56:51)
hands down that's that that's going to (56:48 - 56:54)
happen and unlike stealing a bunch of (56:51 - 56:56)
somebody's (56:54 - 56:59)
clothes from the back of their (56:56 - 57:03)
trunk Pokemon cards are worth a lot (56:59 - 57:05)
they're they're a lot harder to replace (57:03 - 57:08)
than hey you just stole five shirts five (57:05 - 57:10)
pairs of pants in my underwear like that (57:08 - 57:13)
would that sucks that 100% sucks but (57:10 - 57:16)
that's much much easier to replace than (57:13 - 57:19)
like five binders of cards or your your (57:16 - 57:21)
deck for a tournament or what you plan (57:19 - 57:24)
to trade or buy or sell (57:21 - 57:28)
like so I (57:24 - 57:31)
mean they spiked Smash and grab (57:28 - 57:32)
incidents in San Francisco has been (57:31 - 57:35)
dropping uh they put in a bunch of stuff (57:32 - 57:38)
it's dropped significantly over 2023 it (57:35 - 57:40)
is expected to continue to drop as they (57:38 - 57:45)
put more into that there are there are (57:40 - 57:47)
other issues around I mean I like San (57:45 - 57:48)
Francisco as a city I'm probably going (57:47 - 57:50)
to go simply because I have a ton of (57:48 - 57:52)
friends there but San Francisco is (57:50 - 57:55)
really also expensive for an American (57:52 - 58:00)
amican City it is a limited place like a (57:55 - 58:03)
lot of San Francisco was just built to (58:00 - 58:06)
try to make more land uh which is why (58:03 - 58:08)
earthquakes are really bad there um it's (58:06 - 58:10)
very (58:08 - 58:12)
expensive the one good thing I will say (58:10 - 58:14)
about San Francisco is you don't really (58:12 - 58:16)
need a car their public transportation (58:14 - 58:18)
system is really great the cable car (58:16 - 58:21)
system is really great um it's a (58:18 - 58:25)
beautiful city uh it has like a lot lot (58:21 - 58:29)
of California areas a large homeless (58:25 - 58:32)
problem um so there's a lot of positives (58:29 - 58:35)
and negatives around San Francisco I (58:32 - 58:37)
think one of the biggest concerns that (58:35 - 58:39)
people should think about is San (58:37 - 58:40)
Francisco is (58:39 - 58:42)
expensive it is one of the more (58:40 - 58:44)
expensive (58:42 - 58:47)
cities in the United States everything (58:44 - 58:51)
costs a lot there (58:47 - 58:54)
um that said I finally have a reason to (58:51 - 58:55)
go back to San Francisco to visit all my (58:54 - 58:59)
friends so uh I am excited for San (58:55 - 59:01)
Francisco because it gives me a good (58:59 - 59:04)
reason to just take a trip there uh (59:01 - 59:05)
since I used to have family there and (59:04 - 59:08)
they are no longer (59:05 - 59:11)
there speaking of taking trips (59:08 - 59:15)
Greg I was (59:11 - 59:18)
shocked that you booked a trip to New (59:15 - 59:21)
York for Pokemon go Fest (59:18 - 59:24)
why because you don't like Pokemon go (59:21 - 59:26)
yeah but I like New (59:24 - 59:29)
York I'm still deciding if I'm going to (59:26 - 59:31)
buy a ticket to go see a show because (59:29 - 59:33)
I'm in New York and I'm going to I want (59:31 - 59:36)
to see a show for (59:33 - 59:38)
sure but you you bought did you you (59:36 - 59:40)
bought your go ticket though I bought my (59:38 - 59:42)
go ticket I bought I found a hotel that (59:40 - 59:45)
that is in an area that I like that was (59:42 - 59:47)
a decent price so I got a hotel room (59:45 - 59:49)
wait are you going to stay in (59:47 - 59:54)
Midtown um yeah it's close to Empire (59:49 - 59:55)
State (59:54 - 59:58)
in that area it's on one of the central (59:55 - 60:01)
lines (59:58 - 60:04)
um yeah I would want anything off green (60:01 - 60:05)
because I think green gets you closest (60:04 - 60:07)
to Randall yeah I think I'm on the green (60:05 - 60:12)
line I think also I have to like I have (60:07 - 60:17)
to a lot of my initial New York (60:12 - 60:17)
neighborhood thoughts are from when I (60:17 - 60:22)
went there in the 80s and it's a very (60:19 - 60:24)
very different city I went back in 2010 (60:22 - 60:27)
so I but my friends lived in Brooklyn (60:24 - 60:28)
then so we spent a lot of time in (60:27 - 60:31)
Brooklyn and not in the city proper um (60:28 - 60:33)
so I looked at Aras like I don't think (60:31 - 60:37)
my memories of the 80s apply to this (60:33 - 60:39)
probably not uh it's a very different (60:37 - 60:41)
city but yes I have that I haven't (60:39 - 60:44)
bought a flight yet because it's way (60:41 - 60:47)
early for flights for me I'm giving it (60:44 - 60:49)
time because I looked at a lot of the (60:47 - 60:52)
flights and like even half half of the (60:49 - 60:53)
airlines that I know fly to New York (60:52 - 60:58)
haven't even posted flights yet so but I (60:53 - 61:00)
did buy a ticket I did buy a ticket to (60:58 - 61:03)
go to the park Friday morning uh and (61:00 - 61:07)
then I added City day on Saturday and (61:03 - 61:11)
then I have a bunch of people I know in (61:07 - 61:13)
New York so I didn't want to pay for (61:11 - 61:16)
Sunday and be like well I'm seeing all (61:13 - 61:20)
these people so yeah I never going to (61:16 - 61:22)
use this thing so I just and also I can (61:20 - 61:24)
guarantee you by the end of Saturday I (61:22 - 61:29)
will be over over over it will be (61:24 - 61:29)
done uh okay so they they announced (61:31 - 61:37)
Pokemon go (61:35 - 61:41)
Fest they announced four three locations (61:37 - 61:42)
the first one well I guess we'll work (61:41 - 61:45)
backwards New York City again this was (61:42 - 61:48)
like not a surprise when the mayor of (61:45 - 61:50)
New York City like sat there and like (61:48 - 61:52)
raved about this in like a press (61:50 - 61:54)
conference and was like we can't wait to (61:52 - 61:58)
have them back it was like oh okay got (61:54 - 62:03)
it word yeah got it you you definitely (61:58 - 62:06)
want this to happen again (62:03 - 62:10)
perfect so that will be July 5th through (62:06 - 62:13)
7th the 7th is technically the (62:10 - 62:17)
anniversary right I think right July 7th (62:13 - 62:19)
is the (62:17 - 62:19)
anniversary this is the I I'm just going (62:21 - 62:25)
to get this out of the way (62:23 - 62:27)
I out of the one big the biggest (62:25 - 62:30)
complaint I saw out of every the biggest (62:27 - 62:32)
announcement here was like why did they (62:30 - 62:34)
pick Fourth of July weekend and I I can (62:32 - 62:37)
answer this very easily you pick the (62:34 - 62:40)
weekend the city gives you that's it I (62:37 - 62:42)
talked to Niantic a bunch of times about (62:40 - 62:44)
this because like that was a big concern (62:42 - 62:46)
last year of like why is London and (62:44 - 62:50)
Osaka the same weekend and dian's answer (62:46 - 62:53)
was that was the weekend we were allowed (62:50 - 62:56)
to do it I even remember being in Osaka (62:53 - 62:58)
and it was (62:56 - 63:02)
111° Fahrenheit Freedom Units it was hot (62:58 - 63:05)
I I have never seen beads of sweat leave (63:02 - 63:08)
my watch band I was like I've never myi (63:05 - 63:10)
my wrist is sweating right now that's (63:08 - 63:13)
never happened before it is so hot out (63:10 - 63:15)
and there were people in my twitch chat (63:13 - 63:16)
being like they should just delay it (63:15 - 63:19)
till next week (63:16 - 63:22)
what what does that mean you think the (63:19 - 63:25)
you think the 76 Expo Center just has (63:22 - 63:27)
nothing going on next weekend and (63:25 - 63:29)
niantic's like hey everyone we've paid (63:27 - 63:31)
this weekend we're going to pay you (63:29 - 63:32)
again to come back next weekend in an (63:31 - 63:34)
empty Park that clearly has no that's (63:32 - 63:36)
just not how it works yeah just fly on (63:34 - 63:39)
back here yeah just it'll only take a (63:36 - 63:43)
week just keep everything up ignore the (63:39 - 63:46)
next week of events this is not how the (63:43 - 63:48)
world works so like I get it it's a (63:46 - 63:51)
holiday weekend that that's it that's (63:48 - 63:53)
what it comes down to is like randle's (63:51 - 63:55)
Park was like this is the weekend you (63:53 - 63:57)
can do and ntic was like okay that's how (63:55 - 64:00)
these that's how these things work it (63:57 - 64:02)
sucks (64:00 - 64:04)
um sometimes though traveling on a (64:02 - 64:07)
holiday is cheaper MH uh my fourth of (64:04 - 64:11)
July price was way cheaper than my July (64:07 - 64:16)
3 price and my July 5th price so oh yeah (64:11 - 64:19)
uh just check that um I don't know I (64:16 - 64:23)
feel like maybe because I'm old (64:19 - 64:26)
or you don't it's okay if you miss a (64:23 - 64:30)
Fourth of July barbecue it's (64:26 - 64:30)
fine it's okay to miss your fourth of (64:30 - 64:35)
July barbecue I (64:33 - 64:37)
promise well and you know if that's (64:35 - 64:39)
important to (64:37 - 64:39)
you then miss go Fest go to one of the (64:40 - 64:46)
other go Fest yeah um June 14th through (64:42 - 64:48)
June 16th is in Madrid (64:46 - 64:52)
Spain is Madrid a dangerous city what's (64:48 - 64:54)
what's the bad Spain City isn't Spain (64:52 - 64:56)
the pickpocketing country is that what (64:54 - 64:59)
the what media telling me you need (64:56 - 65:02)
tocket you need to not listen to a weird (64:59 - 65:05)
Media stuff yeah get off get off Reddit (65:02 - 65:08)
no no I okay I for sure I I for sure (65:05 - 65:10)
know that like there's cev there's (65:08 - 65:13)
Madrid there's Barcelona these are all (65:10 - 65:16)
Spain and one of them is better than the (65:13 - 65:19)
other I mean as far as I (65:16 - 65:22)
know Madrid is fine it's no different (65:19 - 65:25)
than any other (65:22 - 65:28)
I have not heard anything like you'll (65:25 - 65:31)
die in Madrid any of (65:28 - 65:35)
those it was fine oh you've been Hannah (65:31 - 65:40)
for a day yes oh okay in 2019 it was not (65:35 - 65:43)
very much time spent there mostly that (65:40 - 65:46)
was a few days in Spain where the most (65:43 - 65:48)
eventful thing was my family going to (65:46 - 65:50)
the southern tip of Spain to get trop us (65:48 - 65:52)
madri the capital of Spain right yeah (65:50 - 65:55)
yeah yeah it is it is I just remember (65:52 - 65:56)
when I was booking for (65:55 - 66:00)
cevi people were like oh it sucks that (65:56 - 66:02)
it's like not near Barcelona or Madrid (66:00 - 66:05)
and I was like oh I the I mean those are (66:02 - 66:07)
bigger cities for sure than (66:05 - 66:09)
cev but I can't (66:07 - 66:13)
remember um I have to like I I (66:09 - 66:15)
booked Niantic did not pay for me just (66:13 - 66:17)
disclosure maybe they will I hopefully (66:15 - 66:20)
they will actually please (66:17 - 66:22)
Niantic pay for one of them if you want (66:20 - 66:25)
to pay for my trip to New York I'm into (66:22 - 66:28)
it yeah I'll try to get everyone in um I (66:25 - 66:31)
did pay for my flight for Madrid and I (66:28 - 66:33)
did pay for my flight for New York and (66:31 - 66:34)
and (66:33 - 66:38)
Japan um but I want I I don't want to do (66:34 - 66:39)
the American thing of not knowing (66:38 - 66:40)
anything because I've Never Been to (66:39 - 66:42)
Spain so I have to look that up I have (66:40 - 66:43)
to like look up cultures and stuff but (66:42 - 66:45)
I'm pretty sure like in Spain like their (66:43 - 66:47)
dinner is like super (66:45 - 66:50)
late and everything and like they're not (66:47 - 66:52)
like big breakfast people so like (66:50 - 66:53)
nothing's open really (66:52 - 66:56)
early so I gotta do that research kind (66:53 - 66:59)
of thing (66:56 - 66:59)
yeah I I want to be be educated before I (66:59 - 67:05)
go they they are aware that tourists (67:02 - 67:09)
come to the capital of Spain so there (67:05 - 67:11)
there will be things to deal with (67:09 - 67:13)
tourists because they do know other (67:11 - 67:15)
worlds people in the world exist and (67:13 - 67:18)
come to the capital of Spain every once (67:15 - 67:21)
in a while but also the late night Vibes (67:18 - 67:23)
are kind of nice there so it's funy easy (67:21 - 67:26)
to us that sounds awesome that's what (67:23 - 67:28)
I'm very into is late night (67:26 - 67:31)
Vibes um and then they announced Sendai (67:28 - 67:34)
uh Japan which is May 30th through June (67:31 - 67:38)
2nd so all of these events are (67:34 - 67:41)
dramatically earlier than last go Fest (67:38 - 67:44)
yeah they are and very spread out and (67:41 - 67:46)
spread out which is nice which is (67:44 - 67:47)
probably also nice for an itics team (67:46 - 67:49)
because again going back to like why is (67:47 - 67:51)
o Saka and London the same weekend and (67:49 - 67:53)
the answer was the these are the (67:51 - 67:55)
weekends we were allow owed to do that (67:53 - 67:56)
probably really sucked for them to be (67:55 - 67:58)
like okay half our team needs to be in (67:56 - 68:00)
London and half our team needs to be in (67:58 - 68:02)
Japan and we need to like hopefully have (68:00 - 68:05)
no problems on either end which I think (68:02 - 68:07)
both of those events went actually (68:05 - 68:08)
relatively (68:07 - 68:13)
smoothly um Cai is Northern Japan so I (68:08 - 68:16)
believe it's an hour north of Tokyo (68:13 - 68:18)
Sendai does have an airport I'm going to (68:16 - 68:20)
tell you right now don't fly into that (68:18 - 68:24)
airport one uh from MSP to Sendai they (68:20 - 68:27)
had one flight every 3 weeks to Sendai (68:24 - 68:29)
and it was twice as expensive of flying (68:27 - 68:32)
into Tokyo um so you're probably going (68:29 - 68:35)
to end up flying into Tokyo's airports (68:32 - 68:38)
if you're going um and you will have to (68:35 - 68:43)
take the Shen Consin up to (68:38 - 68:46)
that um which that those prices also (68:43 - 68:48)
went up recently which is unfortunate (68:46 - 68:51)
yeah um the Jr pass isn't as worth it (68:48 - 68:55)
anymore yeah uh (68:51 - 68:57)
um so you'll have to make a trip up (68:55 - 68:59)
there I'm pretty sure Sendai just had (68:57 - 69:03)
like a big earthquake like two years ago (68:59 - 69:06)
or three years ago I can't (69:03 - 69:09)
remember um but I've been told it's very (69:06 - 69:13)
nice up there and it is close to the (69:09 - 69:15)
chancy Pokey (69:13 - 69:18)
lids and Sendai Pokemon is Lapras so (69:15 - 69:20)
that makes sense why Lapras is one of (69:18 - 69:23)
the featured Pokemon there yeah is that (69:20 - 69:26)
the region with the chansy Pokemon park (69:23 - 69:28)
with the giant chy yes I think the (69:26 - 69:30)
chansy Pokemon park is near (69:28 - 69:33)
Cai it looks like there might actually (69:30 - 69:35)
be four of them so yeah those are all in (69:33 - 69:39)
Fukushima all pretty close by to Sendai (69:35 - 69:42)
nice uh Cai also has four days instead (69:39 - 69:44)
of three days which is Madrid and New (69:42 - 69:47)
York also the pre-sale is done for Japan (69:44 - 69:49)
they sold out all four days uh they sold (69:47 - 69:52)
out y Saturday sold out within the first (69:49 - 69:55)
hour of the announcement that's why I (69:52 - 69:56)
was suggesting that people get the (69:55 - 69:59)
ticket even if they're not 100% sure (69:56 - 70:01)
because that's the part that's going to (69:59 - 70:05)
sell out yeah Japan will 100% oh yeah (70:01 - 70:08)
sell up for f um but they should there (70:05 - 70:09)
should be more tickets this was just (70:08 - 70:13)
technically pre-sale so but you know if (70:09 - 70:16)
pre-sale sold out in an (70:13 - 70:19)
hour you're in (70:16 - 70:19)
trouble um then there will be a two-day (70:19 - 70:25)
online event for train around the world (70:23 - 70:27)
you can buy the global ticket now um the (70:25 - 70:31)
worldwide would be July 13th through the (70:27 - 70:35)
14th and that is (70:31 - 70:35)
$15 and the Pokemon they are featuring (70:35 - 70:43)
is marshadow which okay that was why was (70:38 - 70:45)
like I'm definitely marshadow is my (70:43 - 70:47)
favorite so I was like this (70:45 - 70:50)
is th this is all more reason why I'm (70:47 - 70:55)
going to go do this I love Mar Shadow a (70:50 - 71:00)
lot so I was like 1,000% yeah I'm (70:55 - 71:00)
in uh trainers will only encounter (71:00 - 71:04)
marshadow once no matter how many (71:03 - 71:07)
Pokemon go Fest they go to that is (71:04 - 71:09)
unfortunate (71:07 - 71:11)
uh so if you are going (71:09 - 71:16)
to like I I think that that's not look (71:11 - 71:17)
I'm I I get it I'm insane I'm going to (71:16 - 71:20)
all three um but I think like if you (71:17 - 71:22)
were spending the money to go to like (71:20 - 71:24)
New York and then you were like oh (71:22 - 71:26)
should I get the $15 ticket like you (71:24 - 71:28)
wouldn't get another marshadow so you (71:26 - 71:30)
could maybe slip skip the (71:28 - 71:33)
global except the Global's the one with (71:30 - 71:34)
the shiny (71:33 - 71:36)
jangmo don't fall for it Hannah don't (71:34 - 71:38)
fall for it that's a community day (71:36 - 71:43)
Pokemon you skip it it's good (71:38 - 71:47)
shiny do not fall for the jangma O (71:43 - 71:51)
bait don't do it don't don't do it don't (71:47 - 71:54)
do it the only reason I got got a shiny (71:51 - 71:57)
gomy last year which Goomy should be a (71:54 - 71:59)
Community Day this year should be right (71:57 - 72:01)
like that should be the June community (71:59 - 72:03)
day or whatever the only reason I got (72:01 - 72:05)
one is just because I I just happened to (72:03 - 72:06)
hatch one that was it I wasn't trying (72:05 - 72:10)
for it I I hatched like 10 eggs that day (72:06 - 72:12)
one happened to be gy but I didn't do a (72:10 - 72:16)
single gy raid I didn't fall for (72:12 - 72:19)
that um they've been pulling that trick (72:16 - 72:21)
for like four years (72:19 - 72:25)
now they have been yeah (72:21 - 72:28)
uh there are there will be a jang moo (72:25 - 72:30)
Community Day there will be next yeah (72:28 - 72:33)
next and you'll get 14 in one day and (72:30 - 72:36)
you'll be like this is enough what am I (72:33 - 72:38)
going to do with them all I will be (72:36 - 72:40)
happy to have all the shiny (72:38 - 72:44)
Jingo I in scarlet and violet so I'm I'm (72:40 - 72:45)
I'm (72:44 - 72:47)
solid so I want to be very clear here (72:45 - 72:50)
because this this go Fest is Sun and (72:47 - 72:52)
Moon themed with the marsh Shadow with (72:50 - 72:54)
the Pikachu wearing the Sun crown or (72:52 - 72:57)
Pikachu wearing the moon crown that that (72:54 - 73:00)
means we're getting Ultra Sun 2 ultra (72:57 - 73:02)
Moon 2 (73:00 - 73:04)
confirmed that's what il's been working (73:02 - 73:09)
on look at these patterns clear as day (73:04 - 73:11)
you all thought jotto y all thought you (73:09 - 73:14)
NOA this was the sign right here that (73:11 - 73:19)
they're skipping it all Pokemon Legends (73:14 - 73:21)
[Music] (73:19 - 73:25)
seal by Ila (73:21 - 73:25)
all the way down every part of that's a (73:27 - 73:32)
win um okay so they are doing uh two new (73:29 - 73:34)
Pikachus one with a sun Crown one with a (73:32 - 73:37)
moon Crown they're doing Eevees as well (73:34 - 73:39)
uh Eevee with a moon Crown Eevee with a (73:37 - 73:41)
sun Crown I think the Eevees are only (73:39 - 73:43)
for the (73:41 - 73:45)
inperson go Fest I don't think they're (73:43 - 73:48)
for worldwide um each goest will have a (73:45 - 73:52)
featured Pokemon uh so Sendai will (73:48 - 73:57)
have not crawler or Ducklett off the top (73:52 - 73:58)
of my (73:57 - 74:01)
head uh I can't remember which Pokemon (73:58 - 74:03)
Cai it has but uh Spain will have (74:01 - 74:06)
krawler as their featured shiny and then (74:03 - 74:09)
New York will have Ducket as its (74:06 - 74:12)
featured shiny and then the regional (74:09 - 74:14)
Pokemon that will appear at all three (74:12 - 74:15)
will be (74:14 - 74:16)
kfy (74:15 - 74:19)
which sorry to anyone who had a layover (74:16 - 74:22)
in France your kfy value has gone down (74:19 - 74:25)
has plummeted good for me though good (74:22 - 74:27)
for me though because I stocked up on (74:25 - 74:30)
the balant and bouffalant economy is (74:27 - 74:34)
still good so when I go to Japan I will (74:30 - 74:38)
be the Talk of the Town balant still (74:34 - 74:40)
very good (74:38 - 74:43)
um Hawlucha is still good Hawlucha is (74:40 - 74:44)
still very (74:43 - 74:49)
good uh for that uh sigil I think it's (74:44 - 74:50)
sigil is still pretty good except for (74:49 - 74:52)
not for Sig is slightly less because it (74:50 - 74:54)
was in the events last year year but (74:52 - 74:57)
hucha and K I think are still two of the (74:54 - 74:59)
very rare ones right but if you're going (74:57 - 75:01)
to worlds in Hawaii you don't have to (74:59 - 75:03)
worry about come (75:01 - 75:06)
true uh (75:03 - 75:08)
and yeah there there's there's a lot of (75:06 - 75:12)
news here um they announced this earlier (75:08 - 75:14)
they announced dates they did their (75:12 - 75:15)
announcement for the announcement but (75:14 - 75:17)
that was only like what 48 hours ahead (75:15 - 75:21)
of time this was great like I feel like (75:17 - 75:24)
Niantic in the last couple months have (75:21 - 75:27)
been I don't know what changed there but (75:24 - 75:28)
they they've been pushing all these (75:27 - 75:30)
quality of life (75:28 - 75:32)
improvements um they're announcing (75:30 - 75:34)
things (75:32 - 75:37)
earlier that things are spread (75:34 - 75:41)
out it's as if they had a massive PR (75:37 - 75:44)
problem where they let 253 people go and (75:41 - 75:45)
everybody was mad so now they're going (75:44 - 75:47)
to flood it with the things that they (75:45 - 75:48)
would normally dripped out to make the (75:47 - 75:50)
life seem longer to make everybody (75:48 - 75:55)
forget that they laid off 253 people (75:50 - 75:55)
[Laughter] (75:57 - 76:01)
we're going to keep pulling them out for (76:00 - 76:03)
that but also the quality of life (76:01 - 76:06)
updates are really nice yeah they are (76:03 - 76:08)
good yeah every I think everyone has the (76:06 - 76:11)
heel all now right yeah I have I got (76:08 - 76:14)
that I think I got revive all yep those (76:11 - 76:16)
came out at the same time everybody also (76:14 - 76:18)
has the little button that shows up when (76:16 - 76:19)
you're friendship leveling up with (76:18 - 76:22)
someone asking if you want to turn on a (76:19 - 76:24)
lucky egg to get the (76:22 - 76:27)
oh yeah yeah yeah that absolutely (76:24 - 76:30)
fantastic who did I (76:27 - 76:32)
send (76:30 - 76:35)
um yeah there's the I guess as I guess (76:32 - 76:39)
as we get closer to the global go Fest (76:35 - 76:39)
we (76:39 - 76:42)
can uh there will be more details and (76:39 - 76:46)
stuff out there um if you are on the (76:42 - 76:48)
fence of (76:46 - 76:50)
going uh I (76:48 - 76:54)
believe I'm 100 I'm I'm like 98% % sure (76:50 - 76:56)
of this if you buy your ticket you can (76:54 - 76:58)
do the add-ons later I know when they (76:56 - 77:00)
first did you couldn't do the add-ons (76:58 - 77:02)
later so if you're listening to this (77:00 - 77:03)
podcast if you're thinking about going (77:02 - 77:06)
to New York or Sendai or (77:03 - 77:09)
Madrid by your by the day you would (77:06 - 77:12)
prefer to play uh I my suggestion is (77:09 - 77:14)
always buy morning because morning is (77:12 - 77:16)
much cooler than (77:14 - 77:18)
afternoons (77:16 - 77:21)
um (77:18 - 77:24)
and uh people are more energetic (77:21 - 77:25)
the employees are more energetic because (77:24 - 77:28)
they haven't been there all day yet yeah (77:25 - 77:32)
uh I I would I think most of our our (77:28 - 77:34)
communities are doing New York either (77:32 - 77:36)
Friday or Saturday morning I think (77:34 - 77:37)
they're split it was really I mean (77:36 - 77:39)
there's just split because you know some (77:37 - 77:41)
people still have like jobs they can't (77:39 - 77:45)
do Friday um so if you're picking (77:41 - 77:46)
between those two Friday morning or (77:45 - 77:48)
Saturday morning if you want to play (77:46 - 77:48)
with (77:48 - 77:51)
people but again if you're on the fence (77:48 - 77:52)
if you haven't booked a hotel if you (77:51 - 77:54)
haven't booked uh a flight just buy your (77:52 - 77:56)
ticket just just buy like just buy like (77:54 - 77:58)
Saturday morning for whatever it is like (77:56 - 78:00)
20 bucks if you can't go that sucks but (77:58 - 78:03)
it's it's way better than like so many (78:00 - 78:06)
people in La were like I was going to (78:03 - 78:07)
buy a ticket and it sold out and like (78:06 - 78:09)
they lived in (78:07 - 78:12)
La couldn't go I don't know if I'm going (78:09 - 78:14)
to be able to make the flight work I I'm (78:12 - 78:18)
not completely settled on even housing (78:14 - 78:20)
stuff just trying to figure that out but (78:18 - 78:22)
I got my ticket for Saturday morning and (78:20 - 78:25)
we'll see and last year I bought the (78:22 - 78:27)
add-ons day of like the event had (78:25 - 78:30)
already started for that day and I (78:27 - 78:32)
bought the city pass for that day and it (78:30 - 78:34)
was fine so the only thing would be the (78:32 - 78:38)
T-shirt you can add things (78:34 - 78:38)
on hotel and flights fluctuate a lot (78:38 - 78:47)
also they drip feed information so they (78:42 - 78:49)
will most likely have more announcements (78:47 - 78:51)
of the things that are happening at the (78:49 - 78:53)
event as we get closer to the the event (78:51 - 78:56)
they all generally announce new things (78:53 - 78:58)
or special things so if you're like I (78:56 - 79:02)
don't know if that's a value we we also (78:58 - 79:04)
they haven't told us everything yet so (79:02 - 79:05)
we also haven't seen the shirt we don't (79:04 - 79:08)
know what that (79:05 - 79:10)
is could be anything but they did text (79:08 - 79:14)
me that I could pre-order it PRT this (79:10 - 79:17)
morning uh um because it is Sun and Moon (79:14 - 79:20)
themed um with marshadow with the (79:17 - 79:23)
hats it it's it's probably safe to say (79:20 - 79:27)
that they will do something so soo (79:23 - 79:29)
soo I don't remember how the anime says (79:27 - 79:31)
it (79:29 - 79:35)
um and lunala related yeah although (79:31 - 79:38)
those Pokemon aren't out yet so like is (79:35 - 79:41)
that even exciting if they're not shiny (79:38 - 79:43)
and they just appear we don't know (79:41 - 79:45)
anything about (79:43 - 79:49)
necros and necrozma can merge with so (79:45 - 79:54)
Soo and lunala so is that like I think (79:49 - 79:58)
Dawn Dawn wings necros necrozma and dusk (79:54 - 79:59)
M (79:58 - 80:02)
necrozma are just going to be separated (79:59 - 80:03)
like they're just going to be their own (80:02 - 80:08)
raids like yeah yeah gutina or Deoxys (80:03 - 80:10)
they tried to introduce a form changing (80:08 - 80:15)
feature and used it for two Pokemon and (80:10 - 80:18)
stopped what's two Pokemon were that uh (80:15 - 80:23)
hoopa and and and the dog perfu yeah (80:18 - 80:25)
yeah yeah I was like I I was like you're (80:23 - 80:27)
right Hoopa does have it you have to (80:25 - 80:29)
like spend like what like 25 to change (80:27 - 80:31)
it I think so yeah it's not (80:29 - 80:33)
great really dropped the ball they could (80:31 - 80:36)
have just gave us two (80:33 - 80:36)
hopas they they messed up um so like are (80:36 - 80:43)
those going to be in raids uh there's (80:41 - 80:46)
also a bunch of like this season started (80:43 - 80:49)
off with piple as an ultra Beast pole (80:46 - 80:51)
can't evolve yet it can't it will (80:49 - 80:54)
eventually evolve into nag adal I have (80:51 - 80:55)
not seen a single person say that name (80:54 - 80:57)
correctly so none of them watch the sun (80:55 - 81:00)
and moon anime it's Naga Nal a lot of (80:57 - 81:01)
people didn't watch the sun and moon (81:00 - 81:04)
anime to be fair Shaman can also change (81:01 - 81:10)
form yeah three po oh Shaman can okay um (81:04 - 81:12)
so is there going to be a bunch of alra (81:10 - 81:14)
beasts at this like we we just don't (81:12 - 81:18)
know like or they just do a sun and moon (81:14 - 81:20)
theme and like like I I guess what I'm (81:18 - 81:22)
saying is like the raid situation is (81:20 - 81:24)
also what kind of tends to convince (81:22 - 81:27)
people um and we don't know anything (81:24 - 81:31)
about that so we could have the necma (81:27 - 81:34)
all of those forms with special (81:31 - 81:36)
Adventure effects honestly I could see (81:34 - 81:37)
that (81:36 - 81:41)
happening oh yeah like necrozma has its (81:37 - 81:44)
own adventure effect or something yeah (81:41 - 81:48)
or necros also has Ultra (81:44 - 81:50)
necrozma which don't know how that would (81:48 - 81:52)
work (81:50 - 81:55)
either uh there yeah there's there's a (81:52 - 81:57)
lot there that maybe they'll figure it (81:55 - 81:58)
out this (81:57 - 82:01)
year they could just do like all four (81:58 - 82:05)
tapoos are the raids oh (82:01 - 82:08)
true and they could be shiny like (82:05 - 82:10)
there's a lot of raid Pokemon in Sun and (82:08 - 82:12)
Moon there's how many Ultra beasts like (82:10 - 82:15)
12 there's the four tapoos there's all (82:12 - 82:18)
the forms of necrozma there's just a lot (82:15 - 82:22)
they could put into raids um some are (82:18 - 82:25)
definitely more exciting than (82:22 - 82:27)
others uh (82:25 - 82:30)
but (82:27 - 82:33)
yeah my my my goal of going to all of (82:30 - 82:35)
these is to like live stream them and to (82:33 - 82:37)
invite people to raids and to show (82:35 - 82:38)
people the cities they can't go to and (82:37 - 82:40)
stuff and it's nice that they're (82:38 - 82:43)
slightly spread out (82:40 - 82:45)
um (82:43 - 82:48)
and also nice that like they're not (82:45 - 82:51)
overlapping with worlds either because I (82:48 - 82:53)
did feel like (82:51 - 82:55)
that being so (82:53 - 82:58)
close yeah was also like a travel mess (82:55 - 83:01)
for for people to be like assuming (82:58 - 83:02)
though we don't have the dates for (83:01 - 83:06)
worlds yet right oh yeah I guess I guess (83:02 - 83:09)
it's never not been August (83:06 - 83:11)
yeah there's probably a year where it (83:09 - 83:15)
was like maybe not August but yeah H (83:11 - 83:18)
final my final Point here is before we (83:15 - 83:21)
end the show did Niantic (83:18 - 83:24)
learn we could stop there that could (83:21 - 83:26)
just be a that's the end thanks for (83:24 - 83:29)
coming super effective didn't I antic (83:26 - 83:33)
learn that maybe having these events in (83:29 - 83:37)
August led to like heat stroke for a lot (83:33 - 83:39)
of (83:37 - 83:39)
people like June is still (83:41 - 83:46)
hot but not as (83:44 - 83:49)
hot yeah well it depends on where you (83:46 - 83:54)
are in the country but yeah uh (83:49 - 83:54)
I have a feeling they want to spread (83:56 - 84:00)
them out just from a business (83:58 - 84:02)
perspective you want things spread out (84:00 - 84:04)
simply because it's easier to get your (84:02 - 84:08)
employees around and to prepare uh so I (84:04 - 84:10)
always have a feeling that they want to (84:08 - 84:12)
try to pick things that are spread out (84:10 - 84:14)
over the summer months when it's a (84:12 - 84:15)
little bit more (84:14 - 84:19)
temperate um but August tends to be the (84:15 - 84:23)
hottest month everywhere uh in the (84:19 - 84:26)
northern hemisphere that is uh it's not (84:23 - 84:29)
the same in the southern hemisphere (84:26 - 84:32)
but (84:29 - 84:32)
uh again I don't know that they have a (84:32 - 84:37)
lot of choice in what dates they get I (84:34 - 84:39)
think they always want them spread out (84:37 - 84:40)
and then they just go with well this is (84:39 - 84:42)
what we got and you're going to deal (84:40 - 84:43)
with it well they have to be also (84:42 - 84:45)
planning like two years in the future (84:43 - 84:49)
too yeah yeah (84:45 - 84:49)
absolutely uh I didn't even see how much (84:51 - 85:00)
tickets were here looks like Madrid is (84:54 - 85:00)
27 um what what was what was New York 25 (85:00 - 85:07)
New York was uh I think it was 25 but (85:04 - 85:09)
when all the taxes and processing fees (85:07 - 85:11)
were added it was about 30 yeah oh okay (85:09 - 85:14)
yeah it does say early bird special 25 (85:11 - 85:16)
plus taxes and (85:14 - 85:19)
fees (85:16 - 85:21)
um yeah it it looks cool it looks like (85:19 - 85:24)
uh (85:21 - 85:24)
uh it looks like they're they're a (85:27 - 85:32)
little little more ready this year maybe (85:29 - 85:33)
or at least they're presenting (85:32 - 85:36)
themselves more ready this (85:33 - 85:36)
year uh and then um Linton commun day (85:36 - 85:42)
will be this upcoming weekend if I'm not (85:39 - 85:44)
mistaken this podcast comes out on the (85:42 - 85:46)
11th linten commun day will be Saturday (85:44 - 85:47)
March (85:46 - 85:52)
16th um and then the only a little the (85:47 - 85:56)
starter they got left is poo (85:52 - 85:59)
so um I do expect a lot of Gen 5 commun (85:56 - 86:01)
days though this year if we're assuming (85:59 - 86:05)
that Unova tour will be in (86:01 - 86:09)
February and they gota knock out what (86:05 - 86:13)
else is not shining G five which is like (86:09 - 86:15)
swaddle probably something else I can't (86:13 - 86:18)
think of I was going to say Ducket (86:15 - 86:21)
but the the Ducket issue is (86:18 - 86:24)
solved (86:21 - 86:24)
all right well I think that's our (86:26 - 86:30)
show go watch Horizons if you haven't (86:28 - 86:33)
it's pretty all (86:30 - 86:33)
right I think Horizons is worth one (86:33 - 86:38)
month of (86:36 - 86:38)
Netflix it's gonna be an individual (86:40 - 86:46)
calculation it's a good story so far (86:43 - 86:49)
it's a good show so (86:46 - 86:53)
far uh thank you Greg (86:49 - 86:55)
thank you Hannah gosh there was one oh (86:53 - 86:56)
oh yeah I was like there was one thing I (86:55 - 86:59)
want to talk about I was on the Nintendo (86:56 - 87:02)
podcast this week uh so that should be (86:59 - 87:05)
up on their YouTube that should be in (87:02 - 87:09)
their podcast feeds um it is a uh is an (87:05 - 87:12)
all it's it's a gaming podcast with a (87:09 - 87:15)
Nintendo Focus I was on this week uh (87:12 - 87:17)
they lost (87:15 - 87:20)
their normal co-host so they changed (87:17 - 87:22)
their structure to have like a rotating (87:20 - 87:25)
co-host every week so I was I was the (87:22 - 87:27)
the co-host this week so if you want to (87:25 - 87:28)
check that out if you want to hear more (87:27 - 87:32)
of me there's a video version of that as (87:28 - 87:35)
well on on like their YouTube and stuff (87:32 - 87:38)
um so that was fun it was fun you know (87:35 - 87:40)
what my my takeaway of (87:38 - 87:44)
that is I do I do I do I've done this (87:40 - 87:46)
show for 14 (87:44 - 87:50)
years I've I stream on Twitch (87:46 - 87:53)
fulltime and and sometimes I (87:50 - 87:55)
forget even talking to like a hardcore (87:53 - 87:59)
gamer like wood who plays a lot of (87:55 - 88:01)
Nintendo games like through and through (87:59 - 88:03)
makes a lot of Nintendo videos I always (88:01 - 88:05)
forget how you can be such a hardcore (88:03 - 88:08)
video gamer and like your Pokemon (88:05 - 88:11)
knowledge is just not there like like (88:08 - 88:13)
and that that's that sounds bad like I'm (88:11 - 88:15)
not like that's no one's fault but like (88:13 - 88:17)
my own of like being so deep in this (88:15 - 88:19)
franchise but like when I was explaining (88:17 - 88:21)
one of the issues that I had with (88:19 - 88:24)
Legends which was like surf doesn't do (88:21 - 88:25)
what it does in old games and that's (88:24 - 88:27)
frustrating as like a player like if if (88:25 - 88:29)
I have four zubats in front of me and I (88:27 - 88:31)
hit the surf button I can only target (88:29 - 88:33)
one Zubat and at that point that's (88:31 - 88:35)
annoying just make it like water pulse (88:33 - 88:36)
or something don't give me the option to (88:35 - 88:37)
Surf that's just not how it worked in (88:36 - 88:40)
old games and his response was like I (88:37 - 88:42)
didn't even I didn't even think of that (88:40 - 88:43)
like that wasn't even like anything that (88:42 - 88:46)
came up to me and it was like that hit (88:43 - 88:49)
me with a realization of (88:46 - 88:52)
like you're not like an average player (88:49 - 88:53)
you're not (88:52 - 88:57)
like somebody who just like buys a video (88:53 - 88:59)
game here or there like you're a (88:57 - 89:03)
hardcore video game player and like you (88:59 - 89:05)
didn't realize (89:03 - 89:09)
that and I was like what am I doing in (89:05 - 89:12)
life you're a Pokemon master or at least (89:09 - 89:16)
you know a whole lot whatever that is is (89:12 - 89:20)
so um so it's kind of funny sometimes (89:16 - 89:22)
that we all of us on the show or like (89:20 - 89:24)
people in our communities or discords or (89:22 - 89:27)
slacks like like we are (89:24 - 89:30)
like For Better or For Worse in our own (89:27 - 89:32)
bubble of like these advancements in (89:30 - 89:36)
Pokemon that like we pick up on but like (89:32 - 89:37)
a lot of people don't they like don't (89:36 - 89:41)
care there's a lot to know about Pokemon (89:37 - 89:43)
right right yeah like there's probably (89:41 - 89:45)
somebody who absolutely loves Legends (89:43 - 89:47)
and they didn't they don't even notice (89:45 - 89:50)
or see any of the things that I think of (89:47 - 89:52)
when I play Legends and it's that's fine (89:50 - 89:53)
like that there's nothing wrong with (89:52 - 89:56)
that it's just a different level of of (89:53 - 89:59)
knowledge or personal preference or (89:56 - 90:03)
whatnot everybody's got their own Roman (89:59 - 90:03)
Empire finally that question has been (90:04 - 90:09)
answered for me I pokem this entire (90:06 - 90:14)
time using the move Swords Dance or uh (90:09 - 90:16)
Stealth Rock in Legends just keeps me up (90:14 - 90:17)
at night because it just doesn't do what (90:16 - 90:20)
it does in other doesn't do what it (90:17 - 90:22)
did uh but that was a it was a really (90:20 - 90:24)
good conversation I felt like I had good (90:22 - 90:26)
chemistry with wood so if you if you (90:24 - 90:29)
want to hear more of me I'll uh I'll (90:26 - 90:31)
link that podcast in the show notes as (90:29 - 90:34)
