[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 457th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj happy 25th anniversary we are got a loaded show for you there's so much news that i brought in greg yeah i'm excited to finally talk about something 25th anniversary pokemon related that's not shiny cards not you flexing not you ratting me out and spoiling my good name to twitch you'd how dare you i show you overpriced houses i show you aspirational living oh what did he do oh he spent an entire twitch stream dragging my good name through the mud what he did and then he said i could never live with him or you and he said he could never live with you either he just dragged us through the muscles true it's quite the opposite i could never live with him and i was going to say like i i feel like we should have a uh ceremony of honor because this is probably the last time i am recording in this particular recording studio and it is being retired for all time until wow i mean put the curtains up at the end cover the pictures yes uh that was a joke there's not a lot of pokemon news this week [Music] well but i don't understand what what is the issue with uh i mean i can understand you shouldn't live with anybody because you have un natural expectations and standards for what the concept of living in a home that's true it is yeah you're you're 100 right because when i live in my home i live here it is my place to relax and just be a human being not a museum for the nobody you allow into your house to come through and peer at your dustless uh shelving etc so what was the issue no no no there was no issue [Laughter] what did he say he said that hey greg like wrote down everything i am a too messy which is not true because i've been to his house and i have i've been to his house on messy days but of course you know that's not him that's the other person that lives of course he likes to sell everybody else so that it's everybody else's problem forgetting that i have stayed in a hotel with his messy butt hmm on both sides that is absolutely true i bring my own laundry basket i'm very structured yeah this is a hotel room in chicago yeah i saw that and seattle with your when you have your throughout the room uh instagram photo ops this is unacceptable i'll tell you why you're also too messy we're also too messy i didn't say well it was too messy you did too uh i'll take a picture of my side of the bed and i'll take a picture of irene's side of the bed and then apply that to the whole house suss yeah okay probably taking your word for it that that those those things are are each other's sides that's true uh we do have some pokemon news there was a six minute pokemon snap trailer i don't know if you guys saw that i had about four minutes in i was like bored yeah it's it's kind of boring it felt very well we'll get to it uh there's some pokemon go news uh and then we have the chilling rains which we kind of touched on last week but we should talk about chilling rains and then we have the pokemon primer stuff which we didn't talk about which we should and that's pretty much all we have for the episode wait they made a remake of that time travel movie including pokemon yeah pokemon primers very it's very hard to understand and i've seen graphs and stuff but wait i've got pre news free news okay this is what's pretty i yesterday i had to go to the target in edina which is now the town that i live next to i'm i'm next to fancy oh way to dox yourself they must have had 200 of single packs of battle styles out on the shelf where anybody could have gotten them did you get any no i don't want no pokemon cards the the thing i think that most targets are doing although i don't know if it applies to all targets is that if it's if it's a pokemon item more than twenty dollars which is a lot of pokemon items uh you can only get them on fridays at like three o'clock at like the counter and if it's under twenty dollars they will put it on the shelf so booster packs or free game but did your target have a limit of three booster packs i mean it was edina no yeah because i because the one in richfield which has no pokemon on the shelf has a sign that says you're limited to three but the one in edina rules don't apply to them i don't know if we've said on the show obviously the pokemon card debacle is you know i did that video on youtube and then we talk about it all the time on twitch but it's not specific like when you go to target it's not specifically pokemon cards it's the baseball cards are yeah baseball cards are gone they're real hot right now although but last time went to matching a lot of the magic was gone too like their whole area was pretty empty magic has been good in milwaukee i can i can i can find rows and rows of magic well get me my magic school super box for half price that's that's next week buddy i know what is magic school super box now we're skipping that stuff okay all right we are now skipping that set there's some good things in that section yeah i bought four singles and i'm done um let's talk about pokemon snap okay we got two things in regards to pokemon snap uh there was an ign article that actually just came out uh this week and then there was that six minute trailer which i put my reaction of that and i kind of talked over that trailer and gave my impressions on the trailer on youtube if you want to check that out youtube.com pkmencast but uh boy was that trailer kind of corporate e oh it was it was a heavy duty sales pitch but not in a good way yeah not like a fun it was just yeah and at lent hall will be night sometimes oh was it like come on beautiful lentil and take pictures of the many varieties of pokemon and it's like here we have the gentle the magikarp use your scan function to find alternate paths you can sometimes see pokemon from behind or other angles this viper is arguing with this artillery what will possibly happen i tried like i swear i did get minute four before my brain went why why are you doing the stairs it's weird because they've been so good at like the video game industry has been so good at doing like 60 second trailers showing you stuff in a very fast pace and getting you excited but there's like a point in the trailer that is kind of cool um it shows how like alternate paths work um which we knew there was going to be alternate paths for replayability uh although i'm very worried if there's only one alternate path per level that's not that's not a lot that's not a lot but we'll see if there's like three or four or five or if there's alternate paths in alternate paths that would be cool but there's like one point where they're underwater so that's cool in itself you're you're in the what's what's it called the z1 the rove one you're in the vehicle you're the photographer canopy you're all underwater which you know that didn't exist in the first pokemons now i guess you were in space though at one point so that's kind of cool uh so you're all underwater and then they get to a point where i think there's like a not a crawler a clawlitzer and then there's like a tentacruel and then there's like an the game actually pauses and it asks you which way you want to go um so that that didn't happen uh in the first one there there was kind of hints at alternate paths in the first one uh like how you're in the cave and then you throw the pester ball and the electrode explodes and then your cart kind of goes off and it's like it feels like an alternate path but it's just opening up another level yeah um so that was that was cool to see that you know you you had that choice and they showed the apples and they they showed like the pokey flute and although they didn't call it pokey flute and the apples are called fruit fruit fluff i think fluff or fluff fruit no it's fluff fruit i still don't understand this illuminati illuminati thing the illuminati is real because they start off the trailer saying like they're so rare and then later in the trailer they're like they're like here's these balls that turn them illuminati so there are aluminum balls that will light up the pokemon in new and unusual ways but then there are pokemon who are just naturally filled with this toxic substance it's aluminum energy it is not toxic substance they have been mutated to be different and glowing we all know that glowing from the 80s anything that glows is bad that was the 80s it's 20 21 greg glowing is good feel the happiness in your heart and let it shine through you this is a role reversal [Laughter] yeah so apparently at night or sometime you'll trigger giant illuminated pokemon that haven't been hit by the ball it's very confusing uh they could probably make sense once the game comes out i mean they had to they had to discover illumina before they could make balls to trigger illumina come on now it's science there are also those flowers that you throw the aluminum ball in to light them up to get things to happen these are pokey flowers yeah i'm sure uh i don't the problem i think i have with the trailer is boring this is this is coming from somebody who is very excited for this game is i don't think that trailer sold anyone who is on the fence i will agree actually it pushed so there was a short trailer or there was a short one from ign that had pushed me towards the side of getting it uh and then i literally watched this i said uh nah no oh dang yeah it uh it unsold me on it because i was just like this is not uh any excitement i had for this game so lawson which is a japanese convenience store in japan i felt i don't know why i felt like i had to finish that sentence um so there there are a couple japanese convenience stores there's family mart there's 7-eleven there's lawson those are probably the biggest three uh sorry if you're in japan and i missed one please feel free to let me okay no they're missing out so i uh irene and i went to lawson quite a few times i i think we picked up our um gosh we got tickets to something and we picked him up at lawson but uh sometimes 7-eleven or lawsons or family mart's they have like these vending machines in them and they're specifically only they look like atms but they're only for tickets so like movie tickets or concerts or wrestling events and i don't think any of them had english options and or at least some of the events we want some events were weird because they were like you you could go to the machine and get tickets but some events like wrestling we went to see new japan pro you had to go to a website buy it then it would send it to the machine and then you go to the machine to pick it up but you couldn't just buy it was i'm i'm almost positive that like that's how they do all the movies so like if you wanted to get see um uh what's this a rude movie i can't remember what's called secret coco if you want to see coco you go to that machine and then it prints out your like free cocoa or your freezer rude on the receipt that's how people were getting you know codes for zurud so lawson is partnering with uh the pokemon company and they will be offering printed photos from pokemon snap at their machines oh it's just like blockbuster yes i'm not sure if it's a unique machine yet or if it's one of just the ticket machines or if they already have photo machines but you could just buy a color printer or you could just in america just take your switch photos move them to your computer and then send them to like walgreens how do i do that what how do i take my switch photos and move them to my computer my switch and my computer don't talk to each other yeah you do the design where you do the qr code you ever do that qr code thing what are you talking about so so you know how the switch has like uh the eshop at the bottom and it has settings and then it has the photo button where are you all you see all your screenshots yeah yeah okay yeah sure so you click on the photos and you see all your screenshots and then you can either you can see you can send some to twitter that's yeah or facebook i've done that yeah so they added a third button instead of sending the instead of sending to twitter or facebook you can send to qr code and then you open up your phone and then you use your phone's camera and scan the qr code and then a link pops up and then you tap the link and then it it connects to a local connection and then you got to go back and hit okay and then it's on the same wi-fi as my switch no the switch makes its own local wi-fi that your phone then connects to it's really weird how is this so complicated i'm already exhausted it works i tried it it's okay it does it does what it needs to do i mean i will say this there are about 50 accidental photos of me playing ring fit that are on my switch that i need to go and delete it's like it's like when you're playing pokemon go and you just have like 30 photos of like a p dub because you're just trying to get them just trying to clear it out and delete delete delete delete so this wasn't a reality as a kid though well i was a kid you guys were adults but like color printers were not a thing in like well they were a thing in in like 1990 printer in the 80s absolutely a thing not like a color photo printer they were like 500 in the 90s i mean they were expensive but they existed so that's why you had to go to blockbuster but blockbuster was printing out they weren't printing out photos no right they were printing out stickers i don't remember because i never did that because why wouldn't i do the original pokemon snap so look my i would cry i'd be the kid on the floor kicking my legs wailing my arms because i wanted stickers of my pokemon at blockbuster i'm almost positive they were stickers okay and i'm looking up the pokemon stab station look it up and look up how much it costs because that my parents were very they were like no it's too expensive i'm sure it was like 4.99 or something for a sticker sheet that's expensive all right what a sheet because i'm pretty sure it printed 30 stickers they are printed stickers yes they had a small do they say what the size of the stickers were uh i mean they're not big they're pretty pictures they're just tiny they're probably maybe probably like an inch by 2.2 inch yeah uh but you had to bring your you had to bring your memory card or your cartridge um there was an instant memory card inside so you had to look let me blow up this picture jeez but i think that would be cool to like take your switch photos get some good ones send them to uh walgreens print them and then go childhood and then never probably do it again hey childhood okay i'm quick scanning to see if they have a price listed in here maybe i will decorate my new office with uh pokemon snap photos in frames slot your cartridge into the machine it was the cartridge yep because some 64 games would like very few 64 games saved to the cart but a lot of them needed a memory card yeah yeah i don't yeah snap did not need a memory card and you would put the memory card into the controller wait did you or was it yeah no the front the front was that expansion pack for donkey kong or whatever uh there's no price listed in this article all right well if you find the price let us know uh the the article i have here from ign is new pokemon snap this is the title new party that's a sheet three dollars that's not that bad no your parents were three dollars and two thousand is like 45 dollars in 2021 so new pokemon snap was given to bandai namco because of pokken tournament what what there's a stage in poke well namco nam ko bandai namco made both they make uh katamari damasi greatest video game of all time yes continue uh there's a stage in pokey tournament called neos city where if you take your eyes off the fighting game action for a moment you will see a larger pokemon the larger pokemon world beyond the arena pokemon and humans walk side by side down the street there are shops signs vehicles billboards hint at pokemon living together alongside humans in another stage a magikarp festival is in full swing and in another pokemon in humans lays about in an old city square there's a serene wobba fett laying on the on the bench in the background uh and then they kind of talk about how you know pokemon in the background you know seamless detective pikachu pokemon go that kind of stuff and the quote here is pokken tournament utilized band bandai namco studio strengths and it made pokemon appealing in new ways he said ahi being the sorry the snap director suzuki because of this we had another great opportunity to do something together again this led to the development of new pokemon snap we were able to talk with the original developers of the game and we started the project that's the project started with the involvement of many people suzuki also affirms that my theory about making pokemon a seamless part of the world is correct the original pokemon snap did this um they're the author is talking about themselves but there was limited technology back 22 years ago new pokemon snap can make pokemon look better suzuki says the main focus was to build a world where pokemon actually live in the game to do this we first set out to create an exciting world by thinking about environments in which pokemon live creating the scenery detail using the switch's hardware capabilities the fullest uh while doing so we tried to make pokemon the star of the game by making them move naturally and making them feel the presence that is so fun to watch and is even more fun to take pictures suzuki said another key focus of the team in creating the sequel was increasing the number of pokemon that's not a it's a hard thing to do the original snap only had 63 of 151 pokemon some trivia here if you they meant to have 64 pokemon because it was the nintendo 64 but atkins wasn't working so they had to cut atkins last minute that's why they're 63. there's your trivia um now somewhere over uh we the author says there's over 800 pokemon miss rebecca there's 898 pokemon right now that's over 800 pokemon what did you expect just type 8.98 no i would just say there's two less than 900 pokemon right now that would be a better thing accuracy we are just shy of 900 pokemon uh the number new pokemons uh new pokemon snap has the opportunity to feature more uh over 200 in fact suzuki told game informer which is what probably means what 202. yeah 202. 203 tops 298. obviously that's what over 200 means 898 it's over 200. after years of silence uh but for the quiet release of original pokemon snap on the wii u virtual console in 2017 new pokemon snap received a wave of social media new pokemon snap was received with a wave of social media excitement upon its announcement last year especially from fans fond of the original suzuki suggests ban bandai namco was well aware of global fan interest in pokemon snap and points to the capabilities of the switch was a key reason why now was a good time to make an entry but he also notes that the ideal of photography has changed so much in the last 20 years indicating that these shifts were also a significant motive motivator in bringing pokemon snap back though he didn't elaborate on this point it is already at least somewhat visible in the photo editing mode we've seen prior to pokemon snap previews as well as the shift of printing out photos at blockbuster kiosks to share them to social media via the switch's built-in image features another key change from the original pokemon snap that fans have maybe picked up on is the lack of pester balls which were little balls that exploded purple gas when thrown at pokemon irritating them the more subtle ship from apples to fluff fruit uh an item that was thrown to entice pokemon and in our preview i was told that fluff fruit explicitly explicitly doesn't hurt the pokemon if it's thrown at them yeah it's fluffy it's not hard like that oh that makes sense i get it now because getting a hit with an apple would hurt it hurts uh put simply there's a bit more emphasis on treating pokemon like well actual living creatures who don't deserve to have obnoxious irritating gas or painful solid objects lobbed at them when they're just vibing in their natural habitat they just deserve to be captured and fight each other suzuki didn't put that quite bluntly but there are there was a humane angle to these changes i'm sure peta will still be very upset with this they will be uh of course we of course we also thought about some modern changes that would need to be made the pester ball was an important element to bring out pokemon's reactions in the nintendo 64 version of pokemon snap so we decided to add the role of the pester ball to the fur fruit in new pokemon snap even though fur fruit doesn't hurt when it hits a pokemon it makes sense that some sorry fluff fruit some pokemon don't like being hit by fluff fruit so we designed the item to leave it up to the players whether they want to place it near the pokemon or throw it at the pokemon um and then the last article the last paragraph here is it it seems there are far more changes to what fans of pokemon snap might expect than are immediately apparent on the service in our preview we saw the introduction of branching pathways in the aforementioned game informer article the development revealed that the player's research level will increase oh we didn't talk about that in the trailer there's like a research level um new pokemon might appear in areas not previously seen new exhibits of behavior weren't available from before and with all the pokemon in existence to choose from uh new pokemon snap could be ripe for dlc and yeah any any video game could be right for dlc unfortunately for dlc photo decks unfortunately suzuki did respond to my question about this by simply telling me they had nothing to share on the topic at this time so there's your dlc whatever spoiler is that like that's like a common thing in like every interview like new game coming out is there gonna be dlc this time company if the game does really well heck yeah if the game doesn't happen um the thing i'm confused about though is i what i hear a lot is people will like hack games and then they'll be like oh i can see all of this stuff that's going to be dlc because it's in the code for the main game does it have to be there or can they do dlc that's like ha ha surprise you weren't right they can do that second kind because that's what they did with um mario kart when they did the two extra things there and then that's what they do for smash brothers well with um sword and shield there was only a couple pokemon that were available in the game hidden which was like the gigantomax smell metal for example um but the isle of armor and crown tundra were not in the the game code until like a week before so so nobody could see oh they're going to add these pokemon in correct okay okay okay yeah yeah and then once the crown tundra sorry once the isle of armor got added the crown tundra was there it was just hidden and you could see you could see all the pokemon being planned for crown tundra uh when the data mine happened but they scrubbed out they just had holders for the horses so they people knew that there were going to be two new legendary pokemon but they didn't know what they were going to be yeah okay i i am never on that like bandwagon of i need dlc before a game even comes out because i don't know if the game is going to be good like so i guess i guess i guess we'll see we'll see uh i'm excited for snap though i think it looks cool i'm probably gonna get it yeah i don't think it's gonna be somebody came in my twitch stream and they're like are you gonna play snap until diamond pearl came out and i kind of laughed i was like oh boy i don't think i'll be lucky if i'm playing snap after a week yeah it's not gonna be that much content uh the release date falls after the 19th and that is past the time that i can purchase things from myself you weren't going to get anyways greg i mean that didn't help it looks like a wish list y'all could buy it for me for my birthday if you really wanted me to play it but when i say like a game like i i don't expect to play the game after a week one i hope i'm wrong on that i hope there's like so much replayability that there's things to do but two that's not like a bad thing like i picked up an uncharted two one two three and four and they were all sixty dollars and i played them over the course of three or four days and i enjoyed them and then i never touched them again i didn't feel like i got ripped off it was just like i played through the game i liked the gameplay i liked the story it was good but i have no desire to replay uncharted 4 again like i know what happens but i don't think i wasted the 60 so i think i i think for sure i will get huge enjoyment out of pokemons now i think i'll get my 60 worth easy but yeah i don't expect to be playing it every day for the next two months yeah i'm just hoping it redeems my initial when i rented pokemon snap from potomac video in washington dc and i played it for two days and i was like i i can't i don't understand this game and i don't know this is not fun and i brought it back in i mean i'm gonna be watching people play it so i just i i hope that there's not i know what's going to happen there's leaderboards in this game so somebody's going to figure out the optimal way oh yeah to get max points on a picture and then it's going to be like the top 100 people are going to have 999 999 the same photo yeah yeah it's gonna be the same thing about this shiny charizard that's hidden in the game no shiny illuminati i'm excited okay let's take a break and then when we come back we got some pogo we got some primers we got some the other stuff oh chilling rains chilling rains uh we will rain again the the coldest of rain is coming we will be right back [Applause] this is the year [Applause] some could argue that 2019 is the year of practice [Music] this we are back from our break and uh before we get to the news uh two things i don't know if i mentioned this last week or not but uh pod chaser which is like uh it's like

episodes you could particular episode of drive check a card five fingers i guess it's your favorite possibly the one where my cat attacked my dog in the middle of the program go ahead leave a review on that one perfect uh the other thing i wanted to mention is that for so ise has been a thing for almost 11 years it'll be 11 years this january uh and i have july boy i'm just time i should be talking i should not be talking for a living i don't know how i got into this field but i'm very bad at it well the thing is you're better at talking than you are at reading so if that was your choice i would have done the right i wasn't reading anything when i said that uh so in the last couple weeks i've been talking to different advertising companies there's a lot of you normally if you listen to a podcast there's ads at the front middle and um and i have denied a lot of advertising companies over the years because i didn't like the ads they wanted to put onto the show even though they offered me money because i care about the show and so i would rather just make no money instead of having you guys suffer to make some money um but over the weekend i think i've found a company and the only reason i'm being bringing this up is just being transparent because if you start hearing ads that would be the thing but um maybe you know nothing works out maybe maybe there is nothing but i do get that question every now and then especially on twitch or in the slack where people are like why doesn't your show run ads and i've talked about that at length of you know deals that they wanted to but i didn't like the ads they wanted to i didn't have a choice in the ads they wanted to run and when i saw the ads i was like oh no um so if that's the thing so the other reason i bring that up is only because uh starting in may we're gonna revamp the patreon i think we have seven tiers of rewards we're probably going to bring it down to four and then one of the the base tier would be an ad-free version of the show so if we do decide to go with ads and you don't want ads the patreon will have like a five dollar a month get the show ad free you get to support it you get to join the slack pretty much the same thing but i want the i want the we haven't revamped the rewards in patreon in like two years and i want to revamp them to make them feel more fulfilling because like right now if you if you do like the two dollars you get to join the slack but if you don't care about the slack you're not really getting anything whereas in this case for like five dollars you get to join the slack or you get and or you get ad-free maybe you don't care about either maybe you just want to give me five dollars a month that's possible probably not not possible but um yeah so we're gonna be revamping that kind of stuff uh greg those appleton plushies don't buy themselves that's true i mean look at the wasteful spending i don't know if i'd call that waste that's a pretty i i don't like stuffed animals but that appleton is just calling to me i was telling i was telling uh twitch chat the other day will that you only have like one pokemon plush and it's a cyndaquil that i got you that is incorrect oh i have a uh sableye and i have a flabebe so you're up to three now and i have a victini oh you're up to four this is where it starts i mean if that's four over ten years now you're gonna you then you're gonna have a huge shelf of it and then you're gonna have a basket well in in the new recording studio that is being set up right now my shelf of stuffed animals and other memorabilia will be visible as i record in the current layout plan so you will not only see my uh pokemon stuffed animals you will also see my monster hunter stuffed animals my uh georgetown memorabilia for having been a university employee for longer than most of our listeners have been alive uh nice and my uh xerneas and evel tall uh figures of resin figure things that i never took out of the box they're just dusty so anyways nothing to be alarmed about for the the future of the show but uh i'll probably send a uh thingy a thingy an email to anyone's just listening out my my the revamp and what to expect also if you're already a patron and we change rewards every reward will be grandfathered in so like if you're already a producer and we changed the producer from 45 or 46 i'm not gonna be like i need that extra dollar from you it'll all be this is my time to finally stop giving you money finally i think all three of us i give him the most yes i don't know how we got in the situation we're going to end it now lawsuit will change everything this is the piggyback off the pokemon snap news this is off pokemon go live.com april 14th i don't know why i felt obligated to read the date pokemon go celebrates the release of new pokemon snap with a special event uh in new pokemon snap you'll travel to islands a variety of pokemon to celebrate the game's release you can enjoy

yeah i don't have i one i have not seen an anime episode with it two my pokedex app only goes up to gen five so i don't know how to play any gen six pokemon but ferrara seed is definitely in that there will be event exclusive research and a free t-shirt will be available in the shop uh there is also the ability to unlock more rewards if you can work out [Music] you can work alongside players of niantic games to unlock special tiered in-game rewards by participating by in the niantic sustainability campaign in the real world those rewards will be from april 25th uh from 10 a.m to 8 p.m and the tier one which is 2500 activations will unlock five-star raids appearing more often a tier two which is five thousand activations a free bundle of three remote raid passes in the shop and a tier three which is ten thousand activations will be two times the catch bonus and all the rewards from tier one and tier two i don't know what that means what do you mean like an activation is like you actually picking up real life garbage right yeah so looking at their thing is based on social sharing and the impactful actions taken by individuals will unlock in-game tier rewards so you have to show yourself doing this on social media i guess but 2500 seems kind of low like 2 500 people picking up trash would they want more people to pick up trash uh i mean that's a lot more people than pick up trash on an average day [Laughter] i mean i'm gonna say that the um the sharing part of it is the part that they probably will have a tough time uh getting people to do post pictures of themselves on on a social media like i'm sure the social media team only wants to scroll through so many things trying to find examples of people doing this plus they want they want it to be easy tears so they can have a big hype that you know they're taking care of the planet despite you know being on phones that are conceivably terrible for the planet there's like uh tick tock or um reddit live reddit live is like a thing where people pick up trash and they stream it remember you've never been on reddit where they have first of all i don't know that's correct i've never been on reddit okay so if you're on like read it live if you're on like bad if you're on like mobile reddit it'll show you all your normal posts like i subscribe to like r slash destiny or r monster hunter and then so those get filtered in i heard you're not supposed to go on normal reddit you're supposed to go on like artillery the reddit client or something i don't have artillery but if the app existed i would download it uh look i got reddit gold so i got like eight years of reddit gold because i used to be on some other app that reddit bought and then read it was like here's eight years anyways when you go through it will show you it will like randomly put in live so it looks like a normal reddit post but it says live and then you tap on it and then it's like live video like in the shape of instagram or tic toc okay okay and there's it's almost all people like playing guitar playing piano it's like mostly music people but there's always a couple people that stick their phone at the end of like a claw and then they're walking around their city picking up trash so you're like just this yeah i was like this is this this is weird and then i just found myself watching it and it was like yeah it's the asmr dudes it's the asmr people property brothers for fun but it was like all so inspiring of like this dude's picking up trash in his neighborhood that's so cool also i kind of want to pick up trash in my neighborhood oh hey if you are inspired to pick up trash i will give you my home address because the people who were there before left all kinds of chick-fil-a wrappers and all kinds of stuff that i want on my lawn it was it was very inspiring but it's just like a nice thing to do pick up trash and then you can upload it and so the thing on reddit live is like because reddit has their little awards like you give people reddit go gold or reddit silver or reddit hugs don't you have to pay for that stuff you do see this is a scheme but when you give them like reddit gold they get more air time and they're featured longer on the app and it's very it's it's weird yes yes this is very weird look i didn't live through ten years of a crying native american to go out and pick up trash correct you had no idea how much trash it was in the seventies television community the world you live in is so clean oh man it's just like you don't have native americans standing in your corner crying anymore i was so validated when some random woman said to me just confirmed she's like you know i she said the same thing that i always think i was like i lived through the 70s be happy i just didn't throw the wrapper on the ground i just like that is what we were taught yeah there were no there's no outside garbage cans the outside was the garbage can exactly be happy i don't check it out of the car anymore oh man well wisconsin right now we have all the snow melted so now all the like the trash is coming in yeah it's just you need a good windstorm and it all blows to everyone's house that put up a room it all into lake michigan exactly gosh i i we have we i've told this i think i've said this before we i have like low income apartments behind my house and the landlord like didn't shovel in front of the garbage cans so the the trash guys they like wouldn't take the garbage because they didn't want to try to dig the garbage cans out of the snow so for six weeks they never picked up the trash and so the people behind the apartments i mean to be fair it wasn't their responsibility to like shovel it out they could have i mean it's their technically home um technically the landlords so they would just throw the trash bags behind the trash cans because you couldn't put it in the trash can and the only reason that that eventually got cleaned up is because the snow eventually melted it was like the long con but i am one of the very few houses in my neighborhood that doesn't have a fence so when wind blows my yard is the res my yard is the uh where the some of the trash ends up so i have this internal debate of do i pick up the trash or do i check the weather app of whether it's going to be windy again and is it going to then blow up somebody else's problem well here film yourself picking up the trash in your backyard there you go and get freeze captain messi my backyard doesn't have any trash in it hey i picked up all the trash yesterday in my yard because i had to mow the lawn and my yard it's april look uh my lawn looks better than everyone else's lawn right now oh yeah greg when do i have to borrow your lawnmower what what month is that do i have may june you guys should probably get through mate depends on how cold may is but like nothing's growing right now because it's we keep going i got i got rabbits in my yard things i gotta wrap it in my yard dogs keep chasing them so the rabbits don't stay for long if you got rabbits in your yard you're mowing the grass way more often why because they're pooping and the pooping is making the grass grow i don't think that's how that works that is 100 true because they they poop in circles and then you have circles that grow this is a true thing what don't give me these looks this is an audio podcast but if you're watching on youtube hit that like and subscribe button leave a comment below about how rabbits poop in circles i need you to link to the rabbit poop article please skittles last week rabbits pooping this week welcome to the show leave us a five-star review man i am doing a google search rabbits poop in circles i see nothing i see that their poop is perfectly round they have round poop it looks like kibble and the dogs try to eat it but i'm not seeing circles of rabbit poop i will take pictures of my yard look whatever whatever chemical treatment you're doing to your rabbits is not part of reality we we know you do weird things when you're bored you you stream from home you don't leave you go out there you convince rabbits to poop in circles as he's trained them exactly he's trained them to do that they used to be called crop circles now that's not what they're called anymore but i will say i will take advantage of this opportunity that if any of i i have not lived in a house in probably 30 years um if any of our listeners have hot lawn care tips please send them my way because i i'm i am out of my head i have no idea what i'm supposed to be doing although all they say is i'm responsible for the lawn what that means i've had a look at there's a lot of rocks i'm not sure what to do about the rocks like as in the grass or just rocks in the grass it's like it's almost like a prehistoric civilization tried to make a paving stone rock patio i need you to take a picture of your front yard and send it to me the front yard is not the problem it's the expensive to rake it up you rake it up you stick it in the bag and you send the bag by your garbage and then it goes away speaking of i am not thrilled with my search engine right now the pokemon

2012 pikachu really i didn't think pikachu press was all around for almost 10 years well what do you think the squirtle book yeah came from i think that was them i thought that was a third party because people can buy licensing to the pokemon company i mean do i need to go look at my squirtle book uh i don't think that was p i don't think that was 2012 though wasn't that like that early 2000s um pikachu press is publishing imprint from the pokemon company international delivers exciting titles of formats such as activity books sticker books pop-up books that are perfect for children and young pokemon fans um yeah no i think these are really great uh i'm really happy that they did that i mean i don't have kids but i mean my wife and i would eventually want to have kids so i will put these in a tote and they will live in the tote for several years and then when we have kids i don't know what's the record what when do you start teaching your kids abcs when they're like one years old two years old i know i mean our friend patrick's baby boy is what two months old yep i believe he's already got copies of these books yeah yeah and then so uh like gumi is right here and it says goomy but in the lower case it has capital g-o-o hyphen m-e-e gu meme oh is there a nickel in there uh i don't know if there's a bi there's a komala um oh we're on the beach look this is for kids they're not putting binocular in here jeez uh we know we passed the beach scene these these books are actually super adorable they're very very cute i'm super happy with them um these are these these were sold out on pokemon center but they were in stock at amazon and i'm sure i'm assuming they're at barnes noble yeah whatever books are sold the next time i go to that barnes and noble in burnsville uh barnes and noble in burnsville yeah right across from the mall i will go in and see if they have actually i think there's still a barnes noble in roseville probably probably for the for reference i don't think these books are going to be worth like i don't think you're supposed to put these books next to your ancient mew you could try you could try they have pikachu and charizard in that yeah you know let them let them appreciate and value next to those burger king gold coins uh i i don't think you're gold coins i don't i i legit don't think they're they got scalps from pokemon center i think just if there was a demand for this like there are so many people have had babies in the past three to four months and it's like a lot of those people are pokemon fans and said well now that i've got a baby i've got to accessorize yep and i might as well keep it in the franchise that i love isn't that already like a super hot industry anyways like if you make stuff for kids you are just yeah like that like that it has a lot of money in it just in general i mean people keep having kids although less than they have i make trebuchets for kids and i have not sold a single one i told you the marketing plan on those are not good we need to develop a better slogan fling your kid doesn't sell them i mean kids like to be flung i've seen that on the internet chilling rain speaking of things that will probably sell out new pokemon trading good i think it will be better than battle styles if that is your question uh and what spelling of rain what is the effect yeah the spelling of it it's the iha rain that's for the listener who's not watching you shake your hands like you're cheering on a barbecue pit [Laughter] r-e-i-g-n rain wait r-e-i-g-n is not the lane that is the king reign that is the king ring what's the thing that goes around its neck r-e-i-n r-e-i-n rain oh wait really yeah that's why i was been asking you when you keep saying it's me i'm like i'm seeing it not be the yeehaw one and i'm pretty sure reigns don't go they kind of go attached to the ladies in the mouth and why is english the worst language ever because it rains from multiple languages that's the problem so you got rain from the sky you got the eha rain you got the king rain yes this is all bad the problem is english is like the garbodor of languages it's just like anything it can grab onto and suck in it just does it and it's like hey did you know that knife has a silent k at the front so does knight yes my pikachu primer books don't teach me about the reigns what is it the roman reigns what does it have for the letter k oh boy uh k it has komala jigglypuff loves to j i don't think i'm allowed to read this per uh uh common creative rights or whatever yeah so i've seen the official sword and shield and it looks to be an official logo and it's rain as in ruling over a kingdom oh yeah i thought it was the yeehaw because you you put it it goes in the mouth not around the neck if you put it around the neck you choke the horse the horse fights are look i don't have the abc primers bum horse i'm teaching a guy hiding a horse in your life i have never ridden a horse in my life of course i rode a horse when i was like four years old i've ripped i've i've rode a horse myself no i watched the episode of full house with mary kate and ashley olsen and they they rode the horse and then one of them fell off and then they hurt their head and i was traumatized from horses ever since do we not remember this episode i first i never watched that trash show second if you're riding a horse wear a helmet yeah well she was wearing a helmet she got concussion it was a storyline yeah if you're watching on youtube leave a comment below of whether you like mary kittery which one was it which was it mary kate or ashley i don't know what you could never tell you can never tell that age so chilling rulership continue um today this was march 31st the pokemon company international unveiled the next expansion for the best-selling pokemon for the best-selling pokemon trading card game sword and shield chilling rain launching wait what what is this sentence send me the link and i'll tell you it's it's you're dividing it up in the wrong place today best selling pokemon trading card game next concept sword and shield chilling rain comma launching around the world june 18th comma 2021 yes the best-selling part only applies to pokemon trading card game not sword and shield but what is it what is best what is it best selling in regards to what card fight vanguard uh a ton about yugioh uh universal universities what did they just say what did they just say though that's the pokemon the pokemon company unveiled the next expansion for the best card game because they're comparing again for their very super popular card game yes inspired by the crown tundra expansion and the pokemon sword and shield video games sword and shield chilling rain induces introduces 70 new battle styles trainer cars battle style cards and trainers to improve their single strike and rapid strike decks cali rex will make its pokemon tcg debut as a pokemon v and a pokemon v-max in both ice rider and shadow rider forms allowing players to bolster their decks or create new ones centered around this powerful pokemon that will deliver exciting gameplay strategies in addition trainers can look forward to many new pokemon v and vmax including uh and featuring galerion articuno galerion zapdos and gallerian multrace available in booster packs special collections and two versions of elite trainer boxes it took them a real long to get to this point but they have now mastered putting out two different elite trainer boxes you would think they've been doing this since day one we put out a red we put out a blue we put out a gold we put out a silver now with battle styles we put out a red one with an hershey food and a blue one with a nerd shifu we got two more elite trainer boxes one with ice rider one with shadow rider it will include eight condom eight v-max pokemon 15 v pokemon 26 full art v 28 trainers 13 supporters 13 full art supporter cards three new special energy did i say how many cards in total i don't think they have nine 70 new battle style cards but that's not all of the cards well my hot takes last prediction is either neither caloric's card will be any good at all or one of them will be really really good and they're gonna be really bad i think there are scans of them because they're they come out in japan at the end of the month i mean i'll link what i found and you tell me because i don't understand oh it depends on the decks you you can't just look at a card on its own and like look at it and say hey this is a good attacker hey yeah you can you can i have them here okay so um we'll start with ice rider calorics first off the art is very good dart is incredible um it's a water type we're looking at vmax here would be better if it didn't have calorics on it but sure so two colorless emperors ride 10 damage plus this attack does 30 more damage for each of your opponent's bench pokemon so that is 30 60 90 120 150 plus 10 so 160 damage for two energy violates one of will anderson's fundamental rules of evaluating a trading card is if it depends on a decision your opponent made it's not good because all they have to do is not bench pokemon and all of a sudden this card's not doing nothing this attack isn't doing anything you're right but in this format currently benches are being fold because of de dene because of crobat because of gossip floor um benches are benches are stacked in this current format okay so if this is forcing people not to play that would be hurting current decks which is the goal um so for two water energies it's max lance 10 damage plus you may discard up to two energy cards from this pokemon if you do this attack does 120 more damage for each energy card discarded in this way so you are doing 250 damage for two energy and discarding which is in my opinion incredibly good but if you have um yeah you can't discard three you may discard up to two so it caps at 250. but you could just do 130 for one energy discarding well yeah don't overdo and then so i i think that's good it's weak to metal pokemon um which isn't a super dominant type right now well there's mel metal is probably the the main metal deck shadow rider calorics uh has an ability called uh hell gate real weird that they're gonna go with that but we'll see how it's actually translated yeah exactly but that's what it is in japan uh i'm sure the pokemon company international doesn't want to go with that once during your turn you may attach one psychic energy uh from your hand to one of your benched psychic pokemon then draw two cards so that's good that's real nice any ability that lets you attach a free energy is good on top of also letting you draw cards very good um and then for three colorless so any energy you want max dice 10 plus damage this attack is 30 more damage for each psychic energy attached to your pokemon in play so this is a very common mechanic that they use so if you have three psychic energy on calorics three psychic energy on a gore geist on your bench that's 90 90 80 that's 190 damage between so i think both of these pokemon are good i think the shadow rider's better if you can slot it into a deck right they yeah they seem good they seem powerful yeah and also shadow writer's main attack is all colorless so it's more flexible than ice rider which has to have those water type energies well psychic is doing pretty good right now in the tcg because of mewbox which is mewtwo and mewtwo and mew tag team they can there's always there's not always but there's usually a mechanic that um that psychic pokemon sometimes have where they can take advantage of moves of pokemon in the discard pile so mew and mewtwo are the cardless formats so if you discard like a blaziken mewtwo's immusability is like look at that blazing card as long as you have the energy for it you can use that move yourself so the what why it's called the mewtwo or mew box is because you're taking a bunch of pokemon that don't matter with the intention of discarding them just so you can use their moves for your mewtwo and mew i don't remember the pokemon before mewtwo and mew it might have just been mew itself it might have been mu box before but now it's mewtwo view anyways these cards seem good that set comes out in june although japan gets this set in a week i think yeah that sounds good that's all the news we got that's it um question of the week greg okay what is the question of the week question of the week this week i don't know what that was i don't think it was dozier cat i don't i've never listened to joshua cat so i wouldn't know you probably have and didn't realize it that is possible can we bring back the uh the post malone concert that was really good yeah it's on youtube every night if that's what you want and then it keeps suggesting that i said watch it and i have to tell youtube i already watched this youtube's algorithm is noticeable it's so bad it's really bad it really is like i've watched post malone walk around singing his songs and the one song that's vaguely related to the 25th anniversary uh this is from chris do you think we will see apricorn balls and pokemon go and how would they be used which chris christie then the answer is no [Music] obviously they had their opportunity to do it when they did johto i mean like why why would they do that now i think apricorn balls add a level of complexity into pokemon go that they don't want i could see them adding apricorn balls and making them extremely extremely rare i mean they're pretty rare and sword shield um for what purpose what would they add them for like what is that going to do for the game you catch a weasel in a love ball and then you transfer it to pokemon home and now you put it into the weasel's not uncertain shield but if it was you put in a sword and chill now you can breed weasel in a live ball i mean that's like a super niche thing yeah it is not that's not like a selling point like a few people want to have more apricot balls for breeding is not a reason to add it to pokemon go like in the games they all did different things and those different things that they did were a broken because it was gen 2 a lot of the times yeah they didn't work don't don't really apply to how pokemon go works now yeah like i could maybe see an apricorn ball that would work more on an extra large or extra small except you don't get to see that until after they're caught so there's no way to make that determination before throwing it so it'd be decorative only and since you can only get premier balls through raids there would need to be a very specific reason to add these in and i don't think there's ever going to be a reason to add them in um well i would assume that like so pokemon go is eventually going to catch up with all the pokemon right eventually yeah so we're we're pretty much done with j well the the difference now compared to early pokemon go is gen 3 had 130 some pokemon gen 4 had 100 some pokemon gen 5 had 150 pokemon but now we're like now we're like in the 70s and 80s yeah it's like very very slim so we're almost done with gen 6. gen 7 is probably going to be end of this year or early next year because they've been doing uh and then and then we're at gen eight but we've already seen some gen eight stuff uh sir fetch ponyta that kind of stuff so they will probably be caught up by the time gen 9 comes out and then finally they can do gen 9 in go and in video game form at the same time that would be my guess right sure uh maybe we get gen nine next year but i don't maybe like 2022 yeah yeah but maybe 2023 like a pokemon game doesn't always have to come out in fall right true like we got black and white in spring yes um and we're getting arceus legends and technically winter i guess but january january february march oh i'm so excited for that q1 whatever that means you won so march um but like the the more interesting question isn't like the apricorn balls the more interesting question is how do they get players to keep playing after they're caught up because they're not going to just end the game the game makes too much money and there's more things you can do so do you add different pokeballs just to keep those players engaged uh like how do you turn this into like they probably have a five-year plan but they probably also have a 10-year plan probably yeah so i could already i could they're just flying by the seat of their pants i can see them adding pokeball like different pokeballs just to add variety or just to have something to chase yeah i think probably maybe as rewards for research tasks yeah so like like in sword and shield if you care about apricorn balls they're rare but you can grind them out yeah you can like hit up all the trees every day hit up all the trees every day if you're impatient move your clock forward a day hit up all the trees and then just grind out the crown i mean cheat okay yeah um and you can get apricorn balls and i think the pokemon company is really smart in realizing people like these and that they've artificially made them rarer because in doing making and making them rare they give a they give another reason to chase it and they give another reason to breed and then they give another reason to trade like i only have two love balls i'm gonna use mine on a weasel and i'm going to use mine on a zubat greg is going to use his own roselia and spinorac and now we're going i'm going to trade one of my weasels for your spinner rack and now instead of having two pokemon love balls i have four and you have four i know greg desperately loves spinarak i feel like you don't know me anymore i feel like we've reached the point in a relationship where you're just making things up about me i know that greg likes spinner rack more than he likes probopass oh yeah everything before bro exactly that's like more than 800 right there but you don't get that apricorn thing and go like if i caught a weasel and a love ball and go i could move it to sword and shield but i can't like breed it in sort of [ __ ] here is the money-making opportunity and niantic if you do this i you have to write me a check you can change the pokeball you get pokeballs apricorn balls in pokemon go and then you can change the ball that a pokemon is right but only in pokemon go greg you want it i do want it okay wait what changing the pokeballs yeah so i caught the pokemon in an ultra ball but i want it to be in uh i don't know what's one of the apricorn balls love balls i love balls that's the easiest one then i just take it to the professor and i say professor swap this pokemon into a love ball and he says you've got five footballs that'll be 4.99 yep yep niantic write me that check thank you i'm i i'm not rich but i do like money they could do raids where it's like valentine's day any instead of getting premier balls for your raid catching you get love balls they could do that yeah but again that's just like cosmetic but people care about cosmetics and pokemon go because i do because i don't want to catch my shinies in a great ball because they look bad and the pokeball are alterable no yeah no great balls are for throwing away yeah no use you keep the ultra balls for the things you're too lazy to catch you keep the pokeballs for the pokemon go plus that's it ultra balls are for hand catching pokeballs are for pokeball plus exactly great balls are for thrown away the question is the other question not mentioned here is do you think they ever introduced the master ball um but how would they do that and why would you use it pay ten dollars get a master ball because if you find like a shiny shiny if you find like a shiny hitmonchan i feel like golden razz ultra ball you're fine yet you'd be surprised that that one ran away from me [Laughter] yeah or uh you can use it um after a raid and just say i i want guaranteed catch of whatever this raid pokemon is but shiny in a raid is guaranteed well okay maybe i want the non-shiny that's true like i only want to do one landorus don't want to worry about catching it don't want to say they gave me 18 balls but how many can take too much time have i done that i didn't catch a kyogre mm-hmm because kyogre was too far back [Laughter] oh did we even end up going into the denny's or did we just have the denny's fiasco and never showed up oh we ended up going to the wrong denny's and went inside to the wrong tennis yeah but it was good i think the waitress called me hun i so don't remember good that is good service when you get the help right out of my head i love the han you are s pokemon else of the week all right is that your you know what when i rebooted the computer i closed out the the pokemon of the week apple generating application it no so the song do you know the name of the song that it was based on uh i did and then i've forgotten again the name of the song is this must be the place post malone by the talking heads okay the first clue was that the name of the band was talking heads and then we talked about honeycombs and bees and there was some flying stuff in there and uh reference to salandit which is a pokemon um and also a reference for a red spot on the head all right a lot of people got this one right yeah it was you made them too easy who is it it's chat there's no red spots on chat combi it is comb b and if you thought it was vespa quinn then why was i heads vespiquin has one head yeah that was that's why you made it too easy chat it's a of course it's got a great shuffle because this is the entire pokemon i mean it's not a hard pokemon to just throw the whole thing up in there the shiny is decent reminds me of honeycomb cereal full of skittles which you know what i have to apologize that i threw honeycomb under the bust last week when i honestly meant golden grahams honeycomb is a good cereal golden grahams garbage okay so this is the thing i was at the grocery store today and i saw a golden graham's box and it said now honey is back where did it go that's the only selling point of golden grahams for years is the sweet taste of honey what did you do what did you put on golden grams and then you took it off and put a honey back honey why did honey leave so i went cause you know the popcorn stores in my neighborhood yes and they had a s'mores popcorn which yes sounds like it should be tasty and delicious they made it using golden grahams i'm out as they mix in and why would you dad it was why would you not good there was no s'mores do we have trivia on combi dessert no that we don't have any that's why we were talking about s'mores because of boring pokemon no combi is a fantastic pokemon um all right this week's pokemon for your consideration we're going back to a more traditional style of the quiz but still please uh continue to listen to all of the words last line only matters since april 13th 2021 we have been enjoying rivals week in pokemon go while some of the featured rivals are obvious xangoose viper are well known from hawaiian lore others don't come across as clearly this week's pokemon is actually being newly introduced to pokemon go as part of this event along with three others from the kalos region it can be obtained through wild encounters although i have heard this is quite rare in one star raids and as a reward for completing a win a raid research task of the four new halos pokemon introduced as part of this event three share one of their types but only two are monotype our pokemon this week is actually not a good swimmer but instead uses a jet like method for propulsion back in the days when mega evolution was the main competitive thing i ran a team that centered around mega blastoise it has an ability shared with this week's pokemon that boosts pulse moves by 50 percent of their power i was surprised to discover at that time that aurasphere is actually a pulse move this week's pokemon can learn four of the seven known pulse moves excluding dark pulse heel pulse and origin pulse another of the new pokemon introduced to go for rivals week can learn six of the seven which is even more than mega blastoise could learn that is enough information to figure out this week's pokemon there you go and the last
