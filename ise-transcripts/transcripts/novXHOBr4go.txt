[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 400 47th 70th 7-0 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective the half a year until we get to 500. uh i'm your i'm your host sbj uh we were recording this before go fest but i'm sure uh i wow that makeup day they announced for go fest sounds real great the giant error that happened on go fest i can't believe niantic was so unprofessional to allow insert error here to happen i'm outraged i demand insert treats here uh do it too late will's here so the error that has now launched this campaign of disaster that will tumble through the entire weekend is that steve believes that 30 is half of 52. uh you just said half a year until we get to episode 500 half a year is 26 weeks not 30. i was rounding up rounding up you know the other is it is well established on this show that steve rounds it's quick there's no seven so therefore you round past seven [Laughter] i have now switched to a higher definition recording device so you can see in great detail what a mess we've got going on beautiful beautiful beautiful eyes no thank you see you can't do that with mike because if i take my glasses off i can't see a thing but you're so shakespearean i'm like how if i'm not rounding up or down if you would share the outline and let us know what narratives we're supposed to be pushing it would help instead of letting us be free-wheeling free agents just running around the internet making stuff up we got a show for you guys today we're not going to keep it very long uh because i have to record edit i say that i say that we are on a timer today i need food i need food i need food so recording on thursday night i had this great suspicion that there was going to be something announced in regards to unite and that happened yes and i broke it first what does that mean no you didn't i i i saw it i sent you the information first none of you sent it because i sent it to the group first already checked the recipe i've seen something everybody else has seen it i'm the last to know my name ain't joe cereby i don't have google alerts set up for this i've read a podcast if people need breaking news they're not waiting till monday thank you yeah uh yeah so they announced pokemon unite the date uh we'll get to that in a little bit we have some just some other pokemon news to cover pokemon unite stuff question of the week pokemon of the week and then we're done uh this will come out on monday like always uh and then over the weekend greg will and i will be we have already hopefully assuming that the recording doesn't break uh we'll record our thoughts about go fast day one go fest day two um those would have been live in the discord because we have a discord partnership uh hashtag ad and then um if you're on our premium feed you can listen to those and if you weren't on the premium feed you would have to listen live blah blah but if you want the thoughts patreon.com pkmencast uh assuming that somebody's not the recording goes well i'm sure it will it's fine we've never messed that stuff up before never we know exactly what we're doing because we are podcast professionals wait what haven't we done before i what because i've done pretty much everything in my brain i thought we were all going to be in one place also and the plan of us not being in one place came as a shock to me oh yeah because i don't know how to pipe three people into one discord call that seems messy um true with like the stages and stuff i'd also i will be very tired of both of you by the time that's true see we're gonna we're gonna be walking in the hot sun for eight hours and then we go home and then we shower and then we record and then once the recording's over will goes to bed and then greg complains about pokemon go and then i stay up till 3 a.m complaining that i'm too tired uh greg is going to play final fantasy 14. i'm sure he's already got a raid booked for the evening it's pride weekend if anything i'm taking y'all out to the bars at 10 when it starts getting hopping nope no it will out of the market speaking of being on the market let's start off with our first bit of pokemon news which is off screen rant.com a pokemon version of classic labyrinth board game coming this year 25th anniversary saved ravensberg is releasing a pokemon edition of the classic labyrinth board game where players need to collect the most pokemon to win i'm sure greg has played labyrinth i don't know what that is i've never even heard of it you know labyrinth labyrinth is like the behind the

we gotta play that on stream bill anderson does not play role-playing games i know you're not invited well okay getting your replacement i was talking to uh irene about unite because unite got a release date and she goes oh you will and greg are gonna team up right you need two more people and i was like i don't think will does competitive stuff i don't think that's happening i mean i might play unite once just yeah i did it you'll get addicted you'll be like give me that the real issue is how will is not addicted to cafe mix but addicted to gardenscapes and the other one okay no and that's not right but the other one oh was it like house hunters or whatever the one where you're like building a house that's no that's greg no i'm not house i'm probably taking home escapes you're taking houses playing project makeover but a literal conversation i had with my supervisor today i said boy this has been a tough day because i keep getting these little requests that take like half an hour to research and they have to have an immediate result and it's just like it keeps interrupting me and i don't have time for deep thought and he said well you could always work in your free time and i said what free time if i'm not working i'm at the gym and if i'm not at the gym i'm recording something if i'm not recording something i'm asleep my free time is there left there is no free time so yes when am i getting this pokemon unite time in i can tell you uh this was announced this morning today the well this morning as in thursday the day we're recording this yes uh pokemon announces nintendo switch launch date for pokemon unite today the pokemon company international and timmy time i i think it's time i uh studio group announced pokemon unite to release on july 21st for the nintendo switch systems of course there's no time and date we don't know if that's midnight we don't know if that's 10 a.m we don't know if that's worldwide that's a wednesday too so it's a wednesday to celebrate players who log into the nintendo switch i don't know i say nintendo's the nintendo switch version of pokemon unite by august 31st they will receive a unite license for zara aura which will allow players to use this pokemon in battle xero aura can close the distance between itself and its opponents in a blink of an eye just like lightning and deal massive massive amounts of damage all at once its unite move plasma gale sends out a powerful electric electric blast that will create a zone of plasma around the area where the blast hits pokemon unite is the first pokemon strategic team battle game where players will face off in five on five team battles during these battles players will cooperate with their teammates to defend wild pokemon and level up their own pokemon they will need to defeat their opponents pokemon while trying to earn more points than the opposing team within the allotted time pokemon unite will be free to start with optional in-game purchases and unite will become available in september of 2021 on mobile devices and it will include language support across both mobile and nintendo switch for french italian spanish hola and german gutentag for more information uh uh bonjour for french just forget we're going down this rabbit hole wait what's uh what's hello in italian uh i mean usually just give him a chow yeah wow why does that say why is japanese not listed here it's not available in japanese yeah maybe they didn't tell japanese there you go well this is a good day this is tpci press release so that's probably the pokemon company probably has their own press release for japan uh to receive the unite license for zero aura after the end of this promotional campaign players will need to complete a special mission scheduled to be implemented at a future date so that's what it says for um the zera aura stuff so this kind of permission will be you have to do enough things that it's eventually it's going to cost you money to get time so yeah they have to uh they announced a new character they announced a release date uh i who are we taking bets on this game being broken on wednesday right like yeah broken like the series the servers will be broken yeah the server the servers will be boinked do we know who's who who's hosting them did they we don't know i would assume it's whatever time i host their other so i will i will tell you if they're hosting with microsoft 100 there will be problems if they're hosting with amazon things will be smooth as silk well there's there's charlie's company are they using yes everybody uses aws or microsoft yeah there's no others there's no like 10 cent no dedicated server out there maybe they're using google compute but that's a real like if they're a chinese company doubtful yeah that's not my check china does not like google no you know the there's not much to really say here uh they just they have a brand new trailer the trailer was very zero aura focused they've been tweeting pretty much every day the like official pokemon unite twitter account has been tweeting like little 45 second clips of characters so you can kind of see them in action um the thing i did i did want to bring up and i think we touched on it before but like the amount of positivity around this game is so high people are are so excited for this and it was like you would have thought that the pokemon company was ending and and that everything blew up and we're writing off poke like if you saw how mad people were a year ago compared to now like everyone seems hyped for this game and it looks good it looks really fun i mean it's been enough time that the people who just complained about everything got tired and went away and there's only people who are excited about the game who are paying attention to the news but some people have had hands-on experience with it yeah yeah i mean you could have uh switched your switch to the japanese region and download the open beta and i think most people really most people that did that i think ended up enjoying it i didn't really hear anyone walk away i've heard people say like oh i've played mobas mobos aren't for me totally fair uh and i've seen people who played it and they were like wow i really liked it i can't wait till i can read it in english until i know what's happening uh but yeah people seem really really positive i think the only maybe outstanding negative thing that you that no one can control is you know 10 cent has their hands in this and people don't like 10 cent i think it's ironic when people complain on discord or reddit about 10 cent when tencent has huge investments in both reddit and discord but you know i'm not here to def i'm not defending 10 cent i'm just kidding no i'm not i'm just saying it's ironic if you complain about 10 cent on reddit about 10 cent being like i'm not going to play unite because 10 but it's like you're using reddit like they put a huge investment into reddit like two years ago but what you're arguing is that people are uh inconsistent and ill-informed correct which is a known issue yeah but no no one likes tencent no one likes amazon nobody likes amazon no one likes tencent no one likes microsoft nobody just had a change in leadership we're re-evaluating our relationship with that company we also have a huge change in their corporate philosophy they need to drop their horrible commercials from google before even consider joining in if i have to watch one more youtube where a person's telling me that their pay is awesome i'm out oh i mean look papa john's had very mediocre pizza and then we couldn't eat at papa john's anymore because that guy was out of control and then they kicked papa john's off the team and then you went back to papa john's because you were like he's out papa john's is good again and then you ate their pizza and you're like nah never mind went back to papa john's it's like saying i went back to little caesars oh no you always going back never go back these little caesars you get exactly what you're paying for five dollars pizza that is bad i cannot listen to you talk about you you hot box like her oh incredible oh you people are terrible you had a little caesars deep dish because it's genuinely good i i the fact that you have to qualify it to a very specific product to be genuinely good every little caesars i have ever had has been absolutely wonderful and delicious i will caveat that the only time i have little caesars is typically when i've been driving for six hours straight and haven't eaten anything during that entire time but it's still fantastic hunger is the best spice true i heard that at a convention one time what what about their breadsticks their breadsticks are look you're the breadsticks dude as i since okay you fall in the same category as my husband i tell my husband he is no longer allowed to comment on spicy things because his taste buds have been ruined by spice you are no longer allowed to talk about bread things because all you eat is bread you no longer can differentiate bread you've eaten too much bread i love bread i'm gonna get we gotta get steve into uh into an ethiopian restaurant that'll destroy his love of bread right there right here's the question here's the question here's the question yes here's the answer here's the answer unites the unites dropping on uh wednesday yep are we putting money into it no no oh okay rewind it back it up back okay when pokemon pokemon go came out five years ago happy five year anniversary go fest was incredible boy that made it i couldn't believe that was so i caught the i caught the the thing i wanted and ah the uh wow when pokemon go came out what was what was your thought process of the money there do you remember because i remember i remember the like when it came out the hype was high there wasn't there's a lot of things to buy in the store now but there you know there wasn't a lot initially there were some clothes there was storage there was bag space um there was pokeballs of course uh but did you guys drop money right away on that no over my dead body was how i approached all mobile spending over my dead body and i have literally no white knuckled paid for the things that i paid for and go i think the only thing like that i first ever paid for ingo and i will remind you not emmett just ingo uh that i wouldn't even pick a team correct pokemon go correct all right until i was absolutely forced to yes i did not buy anything in pokemon go until niantic sent me a apology credit oh yeah i then used to buy extra storage space i'm dying on this hill that first go fest was one incredible two we all walked away with a hundred dollars in game of currency which you could also give the other half of that statement in that we got free passes and we still got the hundred dollar credit as an apology yeah we did we did i i put i did the i think i think the first week of pokemon go i put 20 in because i wanted to like buy some clothes i wanted to you know report on it properly because we did like we did like six or seven episodes of go when it came out and then i think yeah before before greg was on and then i think i ended up liking it so much that first week then i did the 100 purchase and i think that's all i spent like almost all the way to the like go fest which was like a year later um and the reason i did the hundred was because i did the math of like max poke storage max bag space was already like what sixty dollars if you wanted to max the two of those or something like that uh so i don't know what the currency situation i have no clue how much a costume costs in unite i don't think they revealed that yet um but we know they're gonna launch with the three costume sets the the pirates dad garchomp the like news boy talonflame and whatever the other the pirate is a pirate they've got my money i'm buying the talonflame out no i'm not super into pirates but i think i do want to and we don't even know what they're charging for like character customization because the character custom mission looks really good in the game um but i don't mind i've never had a problem buying like cosmetic cosmetics and stuff especially for a game that's free and especially if i'm sinking time into it i've never had a problem with that i'm just very curious what the you like in a packs i never have purchased a character with real money because i played so much apex that i had the currency to just unlock the characters which i'm assuming unite will have you either pay it up front or you just grind it out for a week and then you unlock it um i'd i'd wager to bet like cramer is probably gonna be either pay or grind out the currency um i'm as good because i'm gonna assume all the characters they showed are just not all free and cramarant is an expert character not like an easy or a beginner character so i'm just saying that cramer is locked but who knows uh i don't i don't mind giving like 20 bucks up front if i get a week's worth of enjoyment then i decide i don't like the game i've spent money on worse things everything behind me proves that i don't know i i don't like don't like i don't like the free-to-play model and i i i need to be like really invest like cosmetics world of warcraft killed my bi cosmetic things uh because it just it all became like when i left the game i'm like well nobody really cared what it looked like except for me yeah and i was just spending money on me for no good reason so why am i doing this uh i mean unite might be a little different because i'd be playing with other people who might want to make sure that i'm the right alolan nine tails and not somebody else's but i it they would it has to be very very very very very good for me to think oh i'm going to put money into this i think it's going to go i was going to say i think it's going to go one of two ways for me either i'm going to hate it and walk away and not play it me trevor chase marshall and chris are going to have a team i'm going to buy the battle pass i'm going to be all in every friday night's going to be unite night and we're just going to grind you see how he cut us out of that i did i want good players excuse me okay greg which moba do you play weekly unite i mean currently none exactly and steve i qualified for players cup too that's not a moba you don't know that this mobile will be like any of the others i it doesn't matter it's the fundamental concepts that my boys have the fundamental concepts down and this is just an adaptation to what they already know this is you know this is the story you don't even know who the jungler is i don't even know what that was exactly all right so steve and i are going to form our other team and then it's gonna be the underdog story when we crush will's dreams and hopes finally it'll be the greatest moment of my life the good luck i've got a documentary you can watch it's a dota documentary but called how i crushed it his teammate dumped him and went for another team and he came back around and won the world championships congrats i have given niantic this feedback i think that myself and maybe a vast amount of other players would probably buy more cosmetics in pokemon go if the characters didn't look so bad and in at least in the 45 second one minute trailer or whatever they showed today the characters customization in unite looks awesome it looks like the characters have like depth it doesn't look like the clothes are are p and g's like doesn't look like the clothes are clipping through each other um and and i hope that you uh niantic i mean there's other things niantic probably should fix like i i know there would probably be players very happy if the character customization and go was like better but there are probably other things they should fix first we all know your number one feedback to niantic was people would buy more customizations for the characters if they could wear socks yep oh yeah i mean we're still we're five years out zero size zero socks zero socks for the men i have such a hard time buying cosmetics any because i barely look at other players like the amount of time that i interact with that opening gift screen is a half a second i like looking at other players i like how my character looks and i tend to notice stuff yeah but yeah it's kind of like the owl in uh in monster hunter like you can buy outfits for your owl and nobody else is ever going to see you yeah but i have that cool robot owl and i spent like a dollar on it good you know what that's a dollar that you don't have for a cup of coffee yeah that's true all right well um when when our when we come back uh the following week we will have our impressions on unite so that'll be exciting true uh we'll take a quick break and when we come back we have just a couple more news articles and we'll do our pokemon of the week and our question of the week and we will uh wrap up the show so we will be right back [Music] this is the year of miraculous [Music] some could argue that 2019 is the year of practice [Music] and we are back from our break you guys like pikachu yeah actually pokemon not in my top 50 that's my top ten i do like when pikachu goes uh pikachu [Music] i like that i like ketchup when people catch again that's the only thing uh this was off pokemon.com this is an older press release i think we covered it before but we finally got to see some of the cards this week um posted across social media but the pokemon celebrations collection is coming out later this year uh the celebrations collection will showcase beloved characters from the pokemon franchise as well as popular card artwork and gameplay mechanics spanning the history of the pokemon trading card game uh celebrations will come with four uniquely designed cards with all foil treatment with the each celebrations would come with four uniquely designed cards with the 25th anniversary logo will feature characters from all over the regions of the pokemon universe from pikachu to zamasunta from professor oak to other familiar faces to [Music] celebrations will introduce a special subset of 25 cards that are close to re uh close remakes of iconic cards from the pokemon tcg including base at charizard umbreon star and tapu lele gx and there's a lot of different sets coming out so there will be a celebrations collection dragapult prime which will be october 8th there will be celebrations collections lance's charizard v and dark sylveon v also october 8th there will be celebrations deluxe pin collection on october 8th there will be the celebrations elite trainer box on october 8th there will also be the celebrations mini tins those are a scam on october 8th there will be the celebration special collection pikachu v union which will be of october 8th there will be the celebrations premium figure collection pikachu v-max which we finally saw a picture of that'll be october 22nd the ultra premium collection october 22nd and then the celebration collector's chest that's usually the little lunch box um those are also a scam uh and that just says october that doesn't actually happen so that's everything that's coming and then kotaku write an article here that says new pokemon cards show 25 pikachu drawn by 25 different artists and that's the v union card so we talked about v union i want to say two or three weeks ago and we talked about how it kind of seems it's it's just like an updated legends legends there was two halves you needed like top half of ho oh top bottom half of oh no one like they were kind of competitive but not really like they you could make them work but they were just better decks instead and these are four cards and the thought process is like man if you're a kid or even adult getting into pokemon cards and you're like i just got like mewtwo's thigh what am i doing with this like that's not super exciting but they did say that the v union cards will come in special sets yeah so you're not going to like pull mewtwo's left thigh from a booster pack you're gonna have to buy a specific set together you're gonna have to buy mewtwo's love ice yeah typically off trolling toad so the v union pikachu cards are part of this generations collection and the four p four cards making up 25 pikachus is really really cool i think it's just like um it's hard to explain it but it's just different art styles of pikachu and like there are a lot of different pikachu but what is missing is derpychoo look in the lower left-hand card right in the center that's pretty derpy we have a very specific derpy chew that i'm looking for straight from japan and it's not in there uh there will also be uh there'll also be flying pikachu surfing pikachu and an updated version of the very first pikachu by the original artist of uh missouri hero r got there i think i got there and true let me know hey you didn't man mitsuhiro arita yes that's how i said i said arita you said mitsurito oh i'm sorry i was more focused than the last night transcribed the s and the u there mitsuhiro uh what we're gonna say well uh just that it's a little disappointing because i know some people in the pokemon celebrations were really excited for the like oh they're bringing back this old funky mechanic from like the heart gold soul silver era and stuff like but like the the dragon pulp prime it literally says on the card not cannot be used in official tournaments yeah that's really disappointing yeah the cool thing about the flying and surfing pikachu i mean if you for whatever reason if no one knows the history of like the flying and surfing pikachu that was like from the original pokemon yellow and in let's go pikachu let's go eevee they turned those into like the hm's which is really cool um but the cool thing about these flying and surfing pikachus is if you look at the artwork the boat on the surfing pikachu and the plane on the flying pikachu are the same boat and plane in giganta max garbodor stuck in his body [Music] so classic game free copying and pasting they can't even come up with that boat design oh my gosh find the unite haters bring them back time to burn it all down burn it down it's really really cool it's i i i like it they become copy paste and when does something become an easter egg when it's good it's an easter egg okay when it's bad it's cocky we'll know in five years when they do a new pokemon game and they'll take the same tree texture and sword and shield and they'll reuse it remember these throwback trees why does that tree look so bad it's an easter egg it's an easter egg wow i remember how bad these look these trees look back in my day now they aged like fine wine uh there will be a reissue of the first charizard card as well uh they've yeah great let's ruin the market again yeah yeah that i'm a little worried a little bit more we'll see anyways this set looks really great uh but we we have until october before it comes out yeah we got a while final bit of news is off the silf road their website not their subreddit their website yeah the silfroad.com um so they have figured out it only took them five years science greg science science experimentation so they'd last week we had jay witz with 5 000 twitter participants this week we cannot cover your fruitlessness again go to actual potential science this week we have over 6 500 throws to test this theory uh theory uh hypothesis thesis okay i'll just there's a lot of math here and there's an audio podcast we're gonna skip past that math we're gonna go right to the results researchers i like how they call themselves researchers uh researchers like like that's a title that you get bestowed upon no until you get this white lab coat you shall not call myself a researcher they i they had you know for all six thousand throws i've heard they had to do it in the lab coat in order for them otherwise it doesn't count right right you have to control for every variable clothing could affect the outcome clothing could affect how you throw your premier ball make sure the lab coat is out get in the lab coat or quit now fraud researchers threw premier balls at raid bosses and recording everything that is known to affect the catch rate see back see thing above we're skipping that and whether the boss was captured or not missed throws were were also recorded a final hidden multiplier was left as a free parameter and we optimized it as optimize its value such as the expected catches from the formula equal the number of catches our researchers actually reported a hidden multiplier value of 1 would indicate that the catch rate formula is accurately predicting the catch results while a value greater than one would indicate that the encounters are easier to catch than the formula predicts we split the data into a first ball thrown second ball thrown third ball thrown etc and found that it best fit the multiplier for each subset optimized multiplier values with a 95 confidence interval and they are shown below so with that being said they're the hidden multiplier okay so i'll explain this for audio people there's you know how there's a graph like imagine stocks i like how he says i'll explain that for the audio people and then he starts using his hands yeah good job good job x and y axis okay and then zygarde shows up no this is okay these are actual terms there's a chart term there's an x and y axis so there's a hidden multiplier of one two three and then there's number of throws your first ball your second ball your third ball and two three is on the x-axis one through ten is on the y-axis okay i'll accept i'll accept and what it's what it's pretty much saying is your third fourth fifth and sixth ball have an increased catch rate compared to your first two throws and then it for whatever reason dips down so your seventh ball is less effective than the fifth and six but then it jumps back up on your eighth ball so your eighth ball will be likely more successful than your seventh ball and then it jumps way up for the ninth ball where the ninth ball thrown seems to be your best catch rate ever and then it dips back down at your tenth ball and people speculated this for a long time because at least i've noticed this although this could be uh specious reasoning but i've always noticed that i caught a lot of legendary pokemon on my last ball i think almost every single one of my mewtwos i either caught like i i remember catching almost all of them in the very last ball but that would line up with this 6500 tests that they did that there is something to say that the more balls that are thrown the higher chance you have to catch well it's it's a curve there is a defined curve of success rate depending on which ball number you are tossing which does not explain why i have never caught any legendary ever no matter how many balls i threw at it there were 36 different people who helped research this but 14 of them really provided the most data kind of where's the control group so i mean so basically what they're saying is you're more likely to catch the raid boss on the tenth encounter the tenth row ninth ball but that's what the they say in their own thing in bold you are more likely to cast the raid boss on the tenth throw of the encounter than the first that's not the stats that steve just read to us i know so like they have it on the ninth but the thing says the tenth no you're a lot more likely to catch it on the tenth throw compared to the first throw oh okay but still ninth is your best of them all yes ninth is your highest chance right but you know what they also suggest like i don't know i shouldn't say this although i'm going to say it i don't know who only has like three golden raspberries in their bag but this is coming from somebody who has like 200 uh same but i suppose if you only had like three golden raspberries you would ideally want to save it for the last like if you only have three and you have 10 balls then you're better off saving your golden razz for eight nine and ten than using them on one two three um that's actually the probably the good information for people who uh you know don't have a lot of resources right compared to you know me i'm just to use a golden raspberry every time no you got to alternate between nana bees and golden houses alternatives settle down and then there you go previously we were very limited in the amount of balls that you would get and now it's i think it's not that uncommon that i end up with like 16 to 18 chances do we think this continues at this relative rate past the 10th or do we think they just say at the 10th it's the same or it goes down like they don't touch on now that we get a lot more throws because of time bonuses and other bonuses yeah they'll have to redo the study well i mean we need another research institution to replicate the study we need somebody else we need competition of the self-road is that where it's not competition it's not competition it's verification the research needs to be replicable to be valid and we need a non-affiliated party to take on the research task i nominate what's somebody we don't like nine out of ten ten dentists agree it's easier to catch nine out of ten dentists agree did uh i think we talked about this either but i think it's it's it's been pretty solidified also by the self road that i i know like two years ago or maybe three years ago we talked about how like the shiny rate in pogo is like one in 450 or around there um i the sulfur road has kind of moved it to it's just one in 512 which makes sense because that's literally like one of the main numbers they have used in the main series game all the time but they they're more confident now that it's not one in 450 that it's actually one in 512 which is the same as masuda yeah which might make sense keep them all the same line them all up well it also is in line with uh how memory is numbered in computers right like one gigabyte is 1024. it's not 1000. so 512 is half of 1024. so i thought that was interesting uh fun to talk about they are 95 sure i think when they released the like one in 450 i think they were i think they were only 90 sure on that number but now they are like closer to yeah it just seems like it's one in five twelve for more research is required yeah replicate the study sorry i'm sure we'll find out why it's always changing i'm sure we'll find out in five more years that it's only taken five years to get to this point we need a double-blind research study yeah replicable etc pokemon of the week no question of the week no questions i'm sorry question but also bobby sent in the uh silf road research al sent in the unite stuff although come on out were we gonna miss the unite stuff come on amateur hour over here uh now question of the week question of the week what is our question this is uh from catherine what non-grass type pokemon would make a good chia pet okay so this is saying all grash types are off can i sidetrack you real quick greg yeah the gays love the chia pets right what what get out of here what is that hideous stereotype of his ally ship strip above everything what is where does that come from i don't know i feel like you seem like a chia pet kind of me greg has zero chia pets stereotyping correct he's left the room wow do you think brent has a geo vet no brent is like me how dare you and the answer is cynthiquil oh that's a good girl would make a good cheap well we also have to not include bonslight or sudowoodo because that's kind of like no i think those count because they're rocks so yeah they would count as good ones well you've never had a chia pet heck no i hate plants i never had a chia pet in my life do you know do you know our friend steven who just adores plants especially house plants but loves plants yes right you've met him yeah i'm sure you've met him he's i send him pictures of the glorious lilies hydrangeas whatever that purple crap is that's growing outside your house and i say stephen how do i kill this i don't want this in front of my house i hate plants no i've never had a chia pet i kind of want to be a plant person but i can't even take care of my front lawn wait dirt you are like the most like you you you couldn't hand because the the plants bring you two gifts in life dirt in your house and homes for insects yeah yeah see i went to nick uh who does all the music for the show good friend very talented he i went to his uh very nice place in boston before the pandemic and there's wonderful crochet work by his wife all over crochet work endorsed does not bring dirt does not bring bugs when you walk into his apartment or sorry well duplex whatever his home you're like wow i just stepped back in the 80s because they're very like like he doesn't even have a tv they're very uh he has a tv because he's got an atari 2600 sitting right in his front living room nick nick and his significant other very retro and you're like how did i get here what life which actually is the song that's playing by the talking heads yeah but their dining room had all these plants like hanging and draped off near the window and it looked very nice and i was like i want that that looks like i feel like sometimes plants bring the living room together it's like a good drill rug but then i gotta think about like i gotta take care of these and i'm just not committed to that my husband has become a plant person oh i was wrong i was like brent yeah when you walked away i was like i wonder if brent ever had a chia pet no brain has never had a chip it but he did buy me a lemon tree oh that's right he did a picture where it was like a bunch of his little micro plants like a real tree like in the simpsons yeah or like in life trees trees i am okay and i will actually to counteract my earlier screed against plants i want because i very rarely do personal endorsements on this program i want our listening community to know that if you have a yard and you want either shrubbery or trees to put in your yard and like i don't know what to get i don't want to spend a lot of money the national arbor day foundation will sell you extremely inexpensive trees and shrubs that are native to where you live in the country and you will be doing a good thing for the world and the environment by reforesting and re-shrubberizing your community yeah you should get them on the podcast we should uh because you don't you know arbor day is the only holiday that i number one enjoy number two celebrate yeah true what were your what were your chia pet pics uh i got so deep on my back we said bond sly i took cyndaquil utah i would say alolan geodude or oh the line the line yeah because they got the hair and they got the air and for that by the way [Laughter] you know what that is that is ageism that is ageism i don't know i've never been to your house greg i don't know if you behind that door you secretly have like a hallway full of plants look at my room i always wonder when there's nothing living in this room kind of like a closet i'm like why is greg going back in the closet what's that oh i mean the closet's right that one's looking like that's the closet yeah didn't know that greg played the keyboard that's new how do you feel about uh like fake plants what's the point they're not they are not doing anything for you they're not because you you want you want the green in the room but you don't want the work of watering the green in the room no plastic needs to be dusted and i already hate that's true that's true that's true and all of a sudden you've got a little family of spiders who said why this is just the perfect place for us to set up shop i loved it yeah that was the biggest turn off for for me was like oh this like if you over water you're going to get a bunch of gnats and like yeah yeah you gotta they are real cute plant shop the milwaukee down in the third ward it's called mod gen and i love going in and i'm like wow these all these look cool this will look cute in my nope nope i know they're gonna i'm gonna mess it up there is on minnehaha avenue here in minneapolis minnesota a store that exclusively sells cacti oh yeah it is a fantastic wonderful place to visit do not bring cacti into your home they're evil they they're out to kill you but i will tell you you never had an oddish plan i would give you more reasons why you don't want plants your cat is going to eat the plant and get sick yeah yeah i do i have to get my number two your cat is going to say i wonder what would happen if i knock this oddish planter over and sprew dirt right across that throw rug that brought your room so perfectly together i do have which you can't see because but that is a bubble sort planter right there i got the reason i pulled this question i almost forgot i so the pokemon center released their gardening set yes and i i post on tic tac and i post on instagram if you want to see it it is huge it is like two funko pops tall this is how we're this is how we're scaling things now the planters are the well it's not it's just a thing you put next to your plants there's some that are planters yeah there's some planters none of these you put dirt in their decorations oh they're gardens they're good things yeah i don't know if i don't trust putting it outside because i know some people like decorate their outside garden and then like i think i think the rain like if you had a strong enough rain i feel like the paint would come off it's not the rain it's the teenagers yeah they're designed to withstand being outside though these are designed to withstand they are they are i'll order another one i'll put one outside i'll put it into my security camera so when a kid comes and smashes it at least you have to have it in your backyard in your fenced backyard in your in your zen garden um because it was very you know they don't they don't do my boy justice they don't do enough love to miraculous i ordered the miraculous one it arrived very it's the same people it's in the same box in the same styrofoam as the other resin stuff [Music] but i would say the quality is better because it's bigger and they they don't like miss with the paint why didn't you get a planter one none of them are planters one of them no no no no no they have ones because i saw somebody comment yes like like yes the bulbasaur is a planter or something oh wait really yeah i looked at the bulbasaur and i was like oh you can't put dirt in it you just put it next to a plant but i don't want to buy that because then i got to put dirt in it oh like the charmander and the pikachu they've got big holes but do they have a hole in the inside like do you actually put oh that is a plant oh i didn't realize that oh maybe i will that is really cute statue features a small pot that can hold the plant of your choice plants not included yeah see when i was looking at the pictures i just thought it was like kind of fake because like it's got a little succulent because some of them some of them you just can't even put like the what i got the miraculous is just a miraculous there's no place to put plants some of them are for being put next to your plants some of them like the oddish you don't there's no room for a plant in there man i am looking at this hideous parade fiasco don't can't we don't have time to talk about it what's the youtube question do we have one yeah we do anyway bulbasaur has a pot you could put a plant in the bubble sort of sold out okay but the charmander one isn't yeah i would rather get the squirtle no i would rather get the pikachu but i think the pikachu one was so good before now it is now it is well the oddest one is super cute but they didn't put a plant next to it squirtle squirtle's got a pot yeah alex squirtle uh oddish is just a gardening statue this is honestly just also a statue yeah yeah but i will i will say for 25 bucks i think they're worth it i legit think they're the pokemon they're like if it wasn't pokemon it would probably be like 20 bucks like something you put in your yard like a gnome or a mushroom or something but uh these these are worth it i have a job while guarding them uh citizen 5101 from youtube says uh also if you're watching this on youtube we have a question the week every week feel free to like subscribe all that stuff with the release of monster hunter stories 2 there's been a lot of talk about this is what pokemon is missing or this is what sword and shield should have been not necessarily monster hunter stories 2 but what features of gameplay from another series do you think game freak should plagiarize in order i loved how they were than that in order to improve pokemon in future generations uh now i don't know if greg has played monster hunter stories too i know will plans on it i don't know if will has played i've been playing monster hunter stories too i play it every single day buddy so good it's exciting although i'm i'm grinding right now so i'm kind of i mean so off the story so let's start with greg what you watched me play what are your initial thoughts as a non-monster hunter fan i mean so it's it is basically what it seems to be is it a fairly live action it's turn-based it's 100 turn-based okay ah it doesn't it doesn't look all that impressive to me like it was like okay so i would say like specifically monster hunter stories too one thing that i really enjoy about which is probably one of the things i shouldn't enjoy about monster hunters as a series altogether is the randomization of rewards that you get so that you have to like you're driven to continually keep playing because it's like you want to build this one weapon you want to build this one outfit but you you never get the drop and the game eventually figures out which thing you're trying to go for and then it intentionally makes it harder and less likely to drop so you gotta be real sneaky it's called the desire sensor um so something like that in pokemon i don't know how they would implement it or like maybe like you uh i was like if you can do some sort of tasks you get a chance to battle but we've had that like battle of random pokemon and possibly capture uh a rare pokemon but you have to like keep you know attempting the same thing but there was the guy with the mansion and he kept saying he had pokemon in his backyard and they weren't really there and his butler would come and put it in his backyard so i remember that was like diamond and pearl or something it was diamond pearl the trophy garden yeah i love that i love that place so the thing about monster hunter stories 2 which i think is is is what pokemon is quote unquote missing uh and i guess i'm going to speak from my experience but i feel like you know from me streaming on twitch and talking to a lot of people and uh just having constant conversations about like what people want in pokemon or what people don't want or i would say that the people who watch on twitch are uh more hardcore than the people who you know they go into store they buy the game they play it and then they you know move on to the next game right true because they're going the extra length so waiting to watch somebody else play but i think sergeant shield kind of attempted this but then in retrospect failed and i think monster hunter stories does this better so and i don't know if it's because i've just played so many pokemon games but the general thought process is you start your pokemon game you pick your starter you get to the first route you catch something you get to the second route you catch something you battle the first gym leader and then the next route you catch something and on these routes you can opt to be like well i want to catch everything before i move on um and you or i want to battle everyone before i move on or i want to find like five hidden items on every route before i move on like that that does exist but by the time you get to the end of the game you have six pokemon some are from the earlier route some you might have found late game but i feel like for most players they go to the elite four with with six to maybe eight pokemon that are ready for the elite four and then everything else is just like filler that they caught or dex things that they caught and they moved on and with ma and so that doesn't really it doesn't really keep you on a route um you just kind of you're there and then you move to the next thing and that's fine like that's in in essence that's not bad but with stories and i have to paint the picture for stories monster hunter stories is a turn-based monster hunter game so it's not like the traditional action game and you be you befriend monsters and you have a party of six and you have monsters from the series that are in essence pokemon and they have different stats so a monster could have a rainbow stat would mean it's like really really rare and that's that's really really good or or the same monster one could be um a blue instead of a green and or it could be a red instead of a green and it's there's just the standard like rock paper scissors with the red blue green um so there's a variety of monsters there's a variety of the same monsters but with with stories i spent so much time before the like i'll just say like the second gym like the second boss battle because before the first boss battle before the second boss battle i was like i want to keep finding these eggs and i want to keep hatching these monsters because i want a monster of this with the rainbow gene and you could you could point to pokemon and you could be like oh well you could do that with brilliant pokemon and that brilliant pokemon has three perfect ivs which it does although the game doesn't show you that initially until you beat the game but that loop itself the loop of like i wanna hatch these eggs i know how to get these eggs when i go into this cave it's randomized at the end of the cave i have a chance for an egg and i can re-roll that chance because when you pick up an egg you can do this little gambling thing of like put the egg down and pick up a different egg and if you push to luck if you push it too far a monster will show up and fight you um but that loop of like i want to go out fi find a cave find a rare cave because they have like like gold caves that are like rarer i want to get an egg i want to bring it back i want to hatch it and then is it better than what i have and that like i have cycled through like probably 50 some monsters and i'm not even at the like second gym and pokemon doesn't have that but but the reason that's good in monster hunter is because that loop is so fun like it's not really fun to like look for a brilliant pokemon although maybe a brilliant pokemon is like close to that but i think sword and shield kind of accomplished that with max raid battles where like it was hard for me to leave the wild area once i got there because i was like oh look at this one look at this one oh you have that one so it's like it's like close but i think that's i think that's what pokemon overall is missing is like this this this other loop that you can have um that makes it so good well like other activities you can do rather than at the beginning at the early part of the game rather than just collecting or battling your way through the game yeah you have like collect it you have collect all the pokemon battle all the pokemon push on with the story um but that weird egg slash find the den get the egg go hatch it is it better no it's not no big deal that was fun so i'm gonna do it again they just mastered that loop in stories and it's it's so like i'm 10 i'm 12 hours into stories i've probably gone through 50 different diff monsters not different like a lot of them like oh i got the same answer like eight times but this eighth one is better than the first seven so yeah we did it so i i want to revise my answer now that i've had a chance to think about it um a crafting mechanic would be awesome so we know in pokemon games we go out there especially sword and shield right there's little sparklies on the ground you pick stuff up what if they added in a thing where you could craft your own pokeballs to have like specific capture skills like oh you know because we already have pokeballs that are defined for capture skills let me make my own i want to craft a pokemon a pokeball that is really good at catching water pokemon i want one that's good at catching grass pokemon uh or i can combine the two and i'm like going for grass water pokemon um or you know like you get really real really rare items and it's just like even better than ultra ball catcher rate or something like that but like some sort of crafting mechanic so i can feel like i put in the work to make the pokeball that i wanted that was specific for capturing this particular pokemon another thing pokemon should copy from other jrpgs is the speed up mechanic like bravely default persona 5 monster hunter stories they all have it where you can like just increase the animation speed um so if you were in a situation where you wanted to grind or you just wanted to catch a bunch of crammer ant because you were hunting for a brilliant cramaran or a shining cramer ant it would just be nice to have like bravely like i said bravely default persona 5 monster understories there's probably more but you it just goes like times two or times three or times for the animation um i mean if we're pulling from other jrpgs i would like a job system in pokemon so that like it's not just other trainers but like you could list yourself as a breeder and that would give you an equivalent of an o power or you could be a ace trainer and that would give you a different set or a water type trainer that would give a boost to those things so that like every character isn't exactly the same like you can choose a specific job that you want to do in the pokemon world i think that would be a bonus to that game yeah i think i think sword and shield are great games i really really like them and i think like the co-op raid stuff is really fun yeah i think brilliant pokemon were like a step in the right direction because they do like when they pop up well when they popped up for the first time i was like whoa why is that one glowing like that's cool um like the trainer card keeping track of your stats and you being able to share that was like really cool but also super limited like show me how many eggs i've hatched or how many steps i've taken or how many battles i've done right monster hunter has that they have the guild cards but they've de-prioritized the guild cards which is kind of sad so i think they're getting there um but man stories two is one of the best sequels to any game i've ever played like they just they just learn so much and i would say stories one was a very average game as a huge monster hunter fan it wasn't like it wasn't a bad game but it wasn't like oh you've never played monster hunter you need to go get this it'll really get you into it it was like kind of hard to recommend it because it's like yeah it's it's fine like it's fun it's just not like a like a super stellar game but stories too holy cow that game is yeah the only problem with stories too is the trees man they took those trees straight out of sword and shield yeah just copy and paste and the 45 minute cut scene before you even get to start the game from ultra sun ultra moon the gameplay that i had watched interested me more the thing that needs to interest greg are the disco outfits that you craft when you craft your outfits from the apps oh you're really stylish in that ball disco man bottoms you have to show me the disco outfits to convince me that this is something that i want to do there's some good outfits i was looking like ingo and emmet the other day there you go uh will pokemon of the week uh so unfortunately i deleted the text for last week's pokemon because i had to reboot my computer and i didn't save it but i just remember i was kind of salty because in celebration of uh pokemon go's fifth anniversary they acknowledged the 555 pokemon by making the 554 pokemon appear more frequently in the wild which of course the 555 pokemon has does not appear in the wild not that they couldn't have made it up here either way i said for the pokemon of the week next year if they followed the same trend there you go natural consequences might make you sick to your stomach i remember what it is i know what it is greg all right i will say the bad thing then okay it's spoopa spupa yeah see before i could say the bad thing oh i just say it's avalog and you jumped in without no you mean you wanted to say the wrong answer yeah i want to say the wrong answer avalog i got so excited what are you french with uh there's no trivia here right oh there is there is and its evolutionary relatives are the only bug type introduced in gen 6. spoopa is the only pokemon with the base stat total of 213. uh spoopa and its evolutionaries are the only gen 6 pokemon in the bug egg group spoopa is like fine it's a turtleneck wearing bug you love it yeah you love your turtlenecks did you guys know that it had its own trophy in smash bros ultimate what why not out of all pokemon what trophy for what though returns as a pokemon summon from a pokeball retaining the same behavior as the previous game spoopa appears at a pokeball summon it uses stun spore to temporarily stun a pokemon in his attack but doesn't move otherwise spoopa also appears as a trophy see the real trick is no smash brother player knows what the pokemon do because they turn off all right they turn up items yes get wrecked items uh as a professional mario kart player that turns off all items in mario kart i want the purest racing experience only racing and we always race downtown baby park because it is the closest to a real life race track it's all valid reasons all right this week's pokemon at first i started out and i made it easy and then since i'm so incredibly hungry right now because we've gone on much longer than we said we were going to hey our timing's been okay the hard version unless your teenage will anderson who would just like get this in a heartbeat think of recent events this week's pokemon has less to do with dragons than it has to do with the woman who lent her family name to the sonic youth side project that produced the whitey album on april 5th 1988. that's all that's all you get [Laughter] well thank you for making it to the end thank you for listening if you want to be like greg and buy a chia pet you know uh here we are you are coming into town and i will make your life unbearable where does it already be unbearable it's gonna be like 88 degrees or something oh it's going to be slightly warm i'm going to have to get my extra summer summer jeans well take off the hoodie when i have the stream backpack i never have a hoodie on because that backpack gets 200 degrees a thousand degrees that is your life choices not mine yeah super fast uh hopefully the stream backpack works though this weekend because uh i'm switching modems and they're real slow on switching the providers so i'm just gonna bring both and hope that one of them works thank you for listening thank you for making to the end uh youtube pkmncast if you're watching on youtube feel free to hit like and subscribe really really appreciate it feel free to leave a
