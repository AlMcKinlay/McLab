episode of the Pokemon podcast it&#39;s (0:22 - 0:26)

Hannah uh hi I&#39;m here I&#39;m not in Han (0:27 - 0:35)
Lulu but I am up past my (0:31 - 0:35)
bedtime yeah hi Bobby also here I&#39;m also (0:35 - 0:44)

San (0:44 - 0:48)
Diego because it is past my kids bedtime (0:45 - 0:49)
uh right (0:48 - 0:53)
now and I am in Honolulu as you could (0:49 - 0:55)
tell if you&#39;re watching the YouTube (0:53 - 0:59)
version I&#39;m surrounded by stuff in (0:55 - 1:02)
Honolulu uh (0:59 - 1:02)
I know that the Pokemon company will be (1:02 - 1:06)
listening to this episode they listen to (1:04 - 1:08)
a lot of episodes and they&#39;re like but (1:06 - 1:09)
they&#39;re probably definitely going to be (1:08 - 1:11)
listening to this one uh because it is (1:09 - 1:14)
the the episode after Hawaii so I&#39;m (1:11 - 1:15)
going to get this out of the way just (1:14 - 1:18)
full disclosure uh Pokemon company paid (1:15 - 1:21)
for my flight and hotel to Hawaii uh (1:18 - 1:23)
they gave me some merchandise I&#39;ve (1:21 - 1:25)
disclosed all that and if I did buy (1:23 - 1:27)
merch on my own I think I disclos that (1:25 - 1:29)
as well so um if there is any (1:27 - 1:30)
disclosures I&#39;m always really (1:29 - 1:32)
transparent of like did you buy that or (1:30 - 1:35)
was it gifted to you so um I think (1:32 - 1:37)
that&#39;s all the disclosures we have I (1:35 - 1:39)
obviously I really appreciate it uh (1:37 - 1:42)
there&#39;s a lot that happened in Worlds (1:39 - 1:43)
this year which we&#39;re going to be (1:42 - 1:45)
talking about uh we just we&#39;re literally (1:43 - 1:48)
recording seconds after the the final (1:45 - 1:51)
closing ceremonies so uh not everything (1:48 - 1:53)
will make it into this episode because (1:51 - 1:55)
I&#39;m on a time limit I am in the (1:53 - 1:57)
convention hall still they got me a room (1:55 - 1:59)
to do this because they gave me a hotel (1:57 - 2:01)
room with the worst Wi-Fi imaginable and (1:59 - 2:03)
also they just don&#39;t have ethernet ports (2:01 - 2:05)
uh I could spend the next hour talking (2:03 - 2:07)
about how Hawaii was great but the (2:05 - 2:09)
Internet situation here is not (2:07 - 2:11)
great I don&#39;t know maybe because an (2:09 - 2:13)
island in the middle of the ocean is not (2:11 - 2:16)
connected to anything yeah that seems (2:13 - 2:18)
like a big (2:16 - 2:21)
factor yes I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t want to (2:18 - 2:23)
generalize Hawaii like altogether but (2:21 - 2:25)
yeah maybe I have friends there the (2:23 - 2:28)
internet&#39;s bad okay okay okay got that (2:25 - 2:32)
out of the way one said it not me we are (2:28 - 2:34)
going to talk about what they talked (2:32 - 2:36)
about in order I guess at the (2:34 - 2:40)
announcements starting with Pokemon go (2:36 - 2:43)
which uh they showed off moreco (2:40 - 2:45)
specifically in go battle league and (2:43 - 2:47)
then they showed (2:45 - 2:52)
off uh that gigantamax is coming uh they (2:47 - 2:56)
teased it they teased it yes um so I (2:52 - 2:58)
don&#39;t know any any thoughts before I I (2:56 - 3:00)
ramble (2:58 - 3:05)
um I it&#39;s cool I we kind of f we I think (3:00 - 3:06)
we kind of figured that was it was (3:05 - 3:09)
coming anyways but uh cool to see a (3:06 - 3:11)
teaser um honestly it gave me (3:09 - 3:13)
Cloverfield Vibes with the whole like (3:11 - 3:15)
something big is com coming because it&#39;s (3:13 - 3:19)
like that is you&#39;re a horor movie com um (3:15 - 3:22)
but uh so uh yeah I it was cool I (3:19 - 3:25)
thought that the teaser for the (3:22 - 3:29)
gigantamax was more fun than the whole (3:25 - 3:32)
thing for more sadly I don&#39;t know feel (3:29 - 3:36)
the same way but um I did uh like I&#39;m (3:32 - 3:37)
glad that more PCO coming to be (3:36 - 3:39)
completely honest because been waiting (3:37 - 3:43)
for them to get the last Mouse in the (3:39 - 3:47)
game like the last Pikachu related Mouse (3:43 - 3:50)
last P clone yeah the the moment when we (3:47 - 3:52)
thought that it was just going to be (3:50 - 3:54)
news about morco and nothing else was (3:52 - 3:57)
hilarious yeah yeah yeah (3:54 - 4:00)
yeah and yeah no the gigantamax Dynamax (3:57 - 4:01)
stuff has been in the decks has been in (4:00 - 4:04)
the game we knew that was coming yeah no (4:01 - 4:06)
date or anything about that it&#39;s just (4:04 - 4:08)
sort of (4:06 - 4:11)
confirmation besides the anniversary (4:08 - 4:13)
artwork so a confirmation that it&#39;s (4:11 - 4:15)
actually happening do you think the fact (4:13 - 4:17)
that she was trying to catch a krabby (4:15 - 4:18)
and they were on the beach is like (4:17 - 4:21)
confirmation that Kingler is going to be (4:18 - 4:23)
like one of the first gigantamax Pokemon (4:21 - 4:25)
I thought it was going to be a Kingler I (4:23 - 4:26)
thought we were going to turn around and (4:25 - 4:28)
see a giant Kingler like coming down the (4:26 - 4:31)
beach yeah (4:28 - 4:33)
it was a cool trailer I think the (4:31 - 4:35)
importance of morco and maybe I&#39;m wrong (4:33 - 4:36)
because we&#39;re literally just recording (4:35 - 4:39)
this like seconds after everything ended (4:36 - 4:41)
I I could be wrong but I think the (4:39 - 4:43)
relevance to morco was the fact that it (4:41 - 4:48)
could change form in battle yes um mhm (4:43 - 4:50)
and I think that is what&#39;s the huge part (4:48 - 4:53)
about go battle league and that means (4:50 - 4:55)
that those other Pokemon that have form (4:53 - 4:58)
changes can maybe get (4:55 - 5:02)
reworked but More&#39;s form changes based (4:58 - 5:04)
on battling isn&#39;t it like even in the (5:02 - 5:06)
main Series yeah but like think of think (5:04 - 5:08)
of another Pokemon that changes form (5:06 - 5:10)
that&#39;s not in the game right now EA (5:08 - 5:13)
slash oh sorry I thought you meant ones (5:10 - 5:14)
that were in the game I was going to say (5:13 - 5:16)
this is the first one like that but yeah (5:14 - 5:18)
I mean I could imagine them doing it for (5:16 - 5:20)
a slush I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to (5:18 - 5:23)
be any retconning of previous forms I (5:20 - 5:26)
mean when they they barely do any form (5:23 - 5:28)
changes to begin with in Pokémon go I (5:26 - 5:31)
think we have brought a couple of times (5:28 - 5:33)
before that there are two or three (5:31 - 5:35)
Pokémon that you can actually change (5:33 - 5:37)
forms for even though they made a really (5:35 - 5:39)
big deal about that when it was first (5:37 - 5:44)
announced yeah so H it&#39;s more PCO most (5:39 - 5:47)
of the announcements were pretty battle (5:44 - 5:50)
related which makes sense it&#39;s worlds (5:47 - 5:52)
yes I guess we could we can just get the (5:50 - 5:53)
elephant out of the room right now and (5:52 - 5:57)
there was no Za news uh I have gone on (5:53 - 5:59)
record for quite a while saying that I (5:57 - 6:02)
don&#39;t think Za is is coming I Bobby yeah (5:59 - 6:05)
Bobby and I had an argument about this (6:02 - 6:09)
um and and I I think the reasons are in (6:05 - 6:11)
in hindsight it&#39;s the same reasons I (6:09 - 6:12)
said which is I think they&#39;re focusing (6:11 - 6:14)
on pocket this year which we now have (6:12 - 6:15)
released it we&#39;ll talk about that in a (6:14 - 6:19)
bit and I think that like I think all (6:15 - 6:21)
the announcements today were fantastic (6:19 - 6:23)
and I think they were super good and I (6:21 - 6:25)
think a Za announcement would have been (6:23 - 6:26)
equally as good I think that would have (6:25 - 6:28)
been fun and everyone wants to see it (6:26 - 6:30)
myself included I just think that that (6:28 - 6:33)
announcement would one overshadow what (6:30 - 6:34)
we just got which I think everything we (6:33 - 6:36)
got was pretty good and I think it would (6:34 - 6:39)
overshadow the winners like what they (6:36 - 6:42)
showed with the exception of pocket was (6:39 - 6:46)
all competitive based to a competitive (6:42 - 6:50)
audience um and I think Za doesn&#39;t need (6:46 - 6:52)
worlds it doesn&#39;t need the viewership of (6:50 - 6:54)
Worlds (6:52 - 6:57)
to do well on it own I mean honestly (6:54 - 6:58)
this felt like more announcements than (6:57 - 7:02)
usual for worlds yeah so already this (6:58 - 7:05)
was a good amount of stuff I I think (7:02 - 7:09)
that I was kind of thinking of zaa and (7:05 - 7:11)
world is kind of like if you are an (7:09 - 7:15)
Apple fan you think of like WWDC where (7:11 - 7:16)
you&#39;re getting the developer stuff where (7:15 - 7:18)
it&#39;s you&#39;re getting announcements about (7:16 - 7:21)
one thing it&#39;s not an iPhone event right (7:18 - 7:23)
like Legend Za is like the next big like (7:21 - 7:25)
game that&#39;s coming out that&#39;s going to (7:23 - 7:28)
be own thing they&#39;re not just going to (7:25 - 7:30)
make a small announcement at at the end (7:28 - 7:33)
of something that has to do with (7:30 - 7:34)
something else that they&#39;re talking (7:33 - 7:35)
about entirely which is a lot of it like (7:34 - 7:37)
you said was Battle related because (7:35 - 7:38)
you&#39;re just coming off of the World (7:37 - 7:40)
Championships of all the competitive (7:38 - 7:41)
stuff yeah they&#39;re not just going to be (7:40 - 7:44)
like oh and also like here&#39;s a game like (7:41 - 7:46)
here&#39;s the next main game like (7:44 - 7:48)
information right at the tail (7:46 - 7:51)
end yeah yeah (7:48 - 7:51)
I it&#39;s like I get that people would be (7:52 - 7:57)
upset that there&#39;s no Za (7:55 - 8:01)
but I don&#39;t like it&#39;s I I just want yeah (7:57 - 8:04)
I when it&#39;s ready it&#39;s ready right (8:01 - 8:07)
like whether it&#39;s coming you know July (8:04 - 8:09)
of next year they show a trailer it&#39;s (8:07 - 8:12)
still G to come out in July or February (8:09 - 8:16)
yeah I don&#39;t think so I&#39;m getting more (8:12 - 8:18)
toward that as well by the (8:16 - 8:22)
way more past February yeah yeah yeah at (8:18 - 8:24)
this (8:22 - 8:29)
point um they then moved over to I think (8:24 - 8:32)
unite was second on the list mhm if I&#39;m (8:29 - 8:34)
remembering correctly uh I think those (8:32 - 8:36)
the they showed three brand new (8:34 - 8:39)
characters suru ledge dark cry and (8:36 - 8:42)
Psyduck I think um dark cry and Psyduck (8:39 - 8:44)
were on the public test server just a (8:42 - 8:46)
couple days (8:44 - 8:50)
ago um got it and Psyduck is just like (8:46 - 8:53)
Pikachu where it cannot evolve I think (8:50 - 8:56)
that&#39;s the right choice uh Psyduck is is (8:53 - 9:00)
immen like super super popular Golduck (8:56 - 9:02)
unfortunately (9:00 - 9:03)
not (9:02 - 9:06)
but I mean Golduck is still a pretty (9:03 - 9:07)
popular Pokemon or at least a pretty (9:06 - 9:10)
cool Pokemon I think um but definitely (9:07 - 9:12)
pyu is the one that I am the least (9:10 - 9:15)
excited about of the three (9:12 - 9:17)
personally I I liked Misty and I and (9:15 - 9:20)
Misty&#39;s Psyduck was fun but I like armor (9:17 - 9:23)
Rouge and I am hyped that dark cry is a (9:20 - 9:26)
Speedster yeah I am a Speedster person (9:23 - 9:29)
in these games and so I&#39;m actually very (9:26 - 9:31)
tempted to go in there in October when (9:29 - 9:33)
they are actually releasing a ghost type (9:31 - 9:36)
Pokemon or it&#39;s not (9:33 - 9:39)
ghostly ghoste I understand yeah (9:36 - 9:43)
Halloween Vibe Pokemon in October and (9:39 - 9:47)
that&#39;s that&#39;s exciting yeah I as someone (9:43 - 9:49)
who does not play unite I really like (9:47 - 9:52)
Psyduck animation as it moves that was (9:49 - 9:54)
that was about (9:52 - 9:58)
it I I thought um I thought it was (9:54 - 10:00)
interesting that okay so (9:58 - 10:04)
side tangent but related to unite is at (10:00 - 10:06)
Worlds I had a meeting on my schedule (10:04 - 10:09)
that was like uh new unite mode it was (10:06 - 10:12)
like 600 PM new unite mode I didn&#39;t sign (10:09 - 10:14)
any NDA for it there was nothing it was (10:12 - 10:15)
just like hey do you want to play Unite (10:14 - 10:17)
with other content creators on Friday (10:15 - 10:19)
night it was like the question was posed (10:17 - 10:21)
to me and I was like yeah of course I (10:19 - 10:23)
would like that sounds great I don&#39;t (10:21 - 10:25)
know what it was going to be used for I (10:23 - 10:28)
get there and they they were like okay (10:25 - 10:30)
we got to get you guys here&#39;s some (10:28 - 10:34)
jerseys I was like oh okay cool they (10:30 - 10:36)
gave us you night jerseys and then they (10:34 - 10:38)
said okay we need to go in back and get (10:36 - 10:39)
photos of you because you&#39;re going to be (10:38 - 10:43)
on stage and before before I got there (10:39 - 10:45)
when they said hey meet us at the stage (10:43 - 10:49)
there&#39;s there&#39;s two stages in the in the (10:45 - 10:50)
world championship Arena there&#39;s the (10:49 - 10:52)
main stage that has like all of them (10:50 - 10:54)
broken down with the monitors above and (10:52 - 10:55)
then there&#39;s like a side stage where (10:54 - 10:58)
they were doing other like smaller unite (10:55 - 10:59)
I think they were doing loser bracket (10:58 - 11:01)
matches to get back into the main stage (10:59 - 11:03)
braack so I went to the the side stage (11:01 - 11:05)
and everyone&#39;s messaging me like no you (11:03 - 11:08)
need to go to main stage and I was like (11:05 - 11:11)
okay again I I didn&#39;t know any of this (11:08 - 11:12)
so I I go to main stage they&#39;re like (11:11 - 11:14)
here&#39;s your jersey uh we&#39;re going to (11:12 - 11:16)
take you in back for photos so I see the (11:14 - 11:22)
entire back of um the event it it is a (11:16 - 11:25)
like a nightmare back there in like a (11:22 - 11:28)
production like how is this being (11:25 - 11:30)
managed there&#39;s so many people looking (11:28 - 11:32)
at so many monitors and there&#39;s so many (11:30 - 11:34)
cables running everywhere it was like (11:32 - 11:38)
impressively cool yeah yeah yeah exactly (11:34 - 11:40)
like I think because I&#39;m like a streamer (11:38 - 11:43)
because people are so accustomed to (11:40 - 11:44)
watching like YouTubers or streamers (11:43 - 11:46)
you&#39;re just like oh you&#39;re just at home (11:44 - 11:48)
on your computer you press go live we&#39;re (11:46 - 11:49)
all doing it right now right we&#39;re all (11:48 - 11:50)
just sitting in front of a microphone (11:49 - 11:52)
with a camera and like some of us have (11:50 - 11:54)
little lights and you just hit go live (11:52 - 11:57)
and you&#39;re live this was like I could (11:54 - 12:01)
like 500 different monitors (11:57 - 12:06)
5ti it&#39;s insane it was so cool to see so (12:01 - 12:09)
um they they then tell us at that point (12:06 - 12:10)
after we get our photos taken that we&#39;re (12:09 - 12:11)
going to be going up on stage because (12:10 - 12:13)
they&#39;re announcing a brand new unite (12:11 - 12:15)
mode and we&#39;re going to be playing the (12:13 - 12:16)
brand new unite mode for the first time (12:15 - 12:19)
in front of people now this mode is (12:16 - 12:22)
brand new I guess to everyone but is in (12:19 - 12:24)
there is a public test server in (12:22 - 12:27)
China uh just like how Psyduck and dark (12:24 - 12:29)
cry are in the public test server for um (12:27 - 12:32)
for us now uh but this new game mode is (12:29 - 12:34)
in that public test server in China it&#39;s (12:32 - 12:36)
been there for I think a couple weeks (12:34 - 12:38)
and it is that it was that mode it was (12:36 - 12:40)
the instead of doing 10 minutes and (12:38 - 12:42)
whoever has the most points after 10 (12:40 - 12:44)
minutes wins it is whoever gets to 500 (12:42 - 12:47)
points first wins which is very League (12:44 - 12:49)
of Legends uh if you&#39;re watching on (12:47 - 12:50)
YouTube and you&#39;re a League of Legends (12:49 - 12:52)
player I would love you to comment below (12:50 - 12:56)
and tell me if you like this change but (12:52 - 12:57)
they were saying that ultimately matches (12:56 - 12:59)
could now last five minutes so they (12:57 - 13:01)
could be quicker matches which is great (12:59 - 13:03)
or they could go longer which is also (13:01 - 13:04)
great right like a lot of people are (13:03 - 13:06)
like if I just had another minute or if (13:04 - 13:08)
I just had another like if we just had (13:06 - 13:10)
one more push we&#39;d be able to like win (13:08 - 13:13)
um so they were like 5 to 15 is like the (13:10 - 13:15)
new time with this 500 point mode and (13:13 - 13:17)
they handed us these phones and they (13:15 - 13:20)
said we&#39;re sorry the game&#39;s only in (13:17 - 13:24)
Mandarin uh and here are four Chinese (13:20 - 13:26)
players who only speak Mandarin but (13:24 - 13:28)
that&#39;s okay because this one person will (13:26 - 13:31)
translate for you you so we&#39;re backstage (13:28 - 13:33)
we&#39;re about to go on stage they didn&#39;t (13:31 - 13:34)
tell us any of this they hand us phones (13:33 - 13:36)
in Mandarin and they&#39;re like here are (13:34 - 13:39)
your teammates who uh only speak (13:36 - 13:41)
Mandarin and they were like you&#39;re going (13:39 - 13:43)
up in a 15 (13:41 - 13:46)
minutes the mode incredibly fun uh I (13:43 - 13:48)
want to talk more about it but obviously (13:46 - 13:50)
we&#39;re on a time limit today but I will (13:48 - 13:53)
say I that was the greatest game of (13:50 - 13:56)
unite I&#39;ve ever played only because even (13:53 - 13:59)
though there was a language barrier we I (13:56 - 14:01)
knew EX L the entire time what I needed (13:59 - 14:03)
to do or what they were doing they knew (14:01 - 14:05)
three they knew four English words they (14:03 - 14:10)
knew ugly uh so ugly was like that (14:05 - 14:11)
Pokemon&#39;s bad or like bad so like (14:10 - 14:14)
buzzwell ugly ugly ugly so we always (14:11 - 14:16)
like they didn&#39;t like buzwell at all uh (14:14 - 14:18)
Greninja ugly ugly ugly like no (14:16 - 14:20)
greninjas no greninjas they knew good (14:18 - 14:22)
they knew okay and then they knew (14:20 - 14:24)
beautiful and beautiful was mostly like (14:22 - 14:26)
amazing so like we would like score a (14:24 - 14:27)
goal and they&#39;d be like beautiful (14:26 - 14:29)
beautiful beautiful okay okay okay it (14:27 - 14:33)
was they were so their energy of playing (14:29 - 14:34)
this game with us on stage and never (14:33 - 14:36)
meeting them was so infectious they were (14:34 - 14:40)
so funny uh the entire time like again (14:36 - 14:41)
language barrier and they were (14:40 - 14:43)
definitely speaking Mandarin to each (14:41 - 14:45)
other but like also being like beautiful (14:43 - 14:49)
okay good like we it was so fun and like (14:45 - 14:52)
we just got it just like clicked yeah (14:49 - 14:55)
that&#39;s wild that&#39;s incredible oh my gosh (14:52 - 14:58)
I&#39;m so glad it worked to begin with but (14:55 - 15:03)
also that sounds that sounds so (14:58 - 15:07)
cool and just up on the main stage yeah (15:03 - 15:08)
yeah up on the main stage and when you (15:07 - 15:10)
put those headphones on there&#39;s like a (15:08 - 15:12)
buzzing that happens to like cancel out (15:10 - 15:14)
everything CU you know they don&#39;t want (15:12 - 15:15)
that they don&#39;t want like competitors to (15:14 - 15:17)
hear what the crowd is saying and Steve (15:15 - 15:18)
do you not have noise cancelling (15:17 - 15:21)
headphones I do it was like it I do like (15:18 - 15:26)
but like a huge buzz like like crazy (15:21 - 15:30)
Buzz um that sounds not like not like (15:26 - 15:31)
Apple headphones or like Beats (15:30 - 15:33)
headphones like I&#39;ve had that like noise (15:31 - 15:34)
cancelling it (15:33 - 15:37)
was it was (15:34 - 15:40)
intense I&#39;m confused as to whether the (15:37 - 15:41)
buzz is supposed to be in noise (15:40 - 15:43)
cancelling headphones or not cuz I don&#39;t (15:41 - 15:44)
have any of my noise cancelling (15:43 - 15:48)
headphones um I think you do you might (15:44 - 15:50)
just tune it out there&#39;s there&#39;s a (15:48 - 15:52)
lowlevel buzz in every noise caning (15:50 - 15:57)
headon I&#39;ve ever tried really yeah yeah (15:52 - 15:59)
maybe you have them off on your airpods (15:57 - 16:01)
or everybody&#39;s brains and ears just work (15:59 - 16:04)
differently or you worn them for so long (16:01 - 16:06)
feel like I&#39;ve felt them on older ones (16:04 - 16:07)
but I&#39;ve not like on these ones I&#39;ve (16:06 - 16:09)
never heard a buzz on these when I turn (16:07 - 16:13)
on the noise cancelling mode on them (16:09 - 16:16)
H but these were strong these are these (16:13 - 16:17)
are strong (16:16 - 16:21)
Buzz ugly ugly ugly (16:17 - 16:21)
ugly yeah so we&#39;ll probably have to have (16:22 - 16:25)
Greg on because I want to hear Greg&#39;s (16:24 - 16:27)
thoughts and then we&#39;ll we&#39;ll I have so (16:25 - 16:29)
much to talk about this entire episode (16:27 - 16:31)
could be me going backstage and talking (16:29 - 16:33)
about unite it was a such a cool I guess (16:31 - 16:34)
you don&#39;t have to sign in an NDA when (16:33 - 16:38)
they don&#39;t tell you literally (16:34 - 16:38)
anything and when they&#39;re announcing the (16:38 - 16:44)
mode the next day or two days later uh (16:40 - 16:46)
they announced it literally right before (16:44 - 16:47)
we went on stage so they announced it (16:46 - 16:50)
and then we went on stage yeah (16:47 - 16:52)
immediately so like they&#39;re briefing us (16:50 - 16:53)
as they like we&#39;re about to play the (16:52 - 16:56)
trailer by the way um also like just a (16:53 - 17:00)
side note like the I didn&#39;t even think (16:56 - 17:01)
about like the language when I was (17:00 - 17:03)
actually playing which is kind of like (17:01 - 17:05)
cool of like I played a United they (17:03 - 17:07)
obviously the the new mode has changed (17:05 - 17:08)
and there&#39;s like new abilities and stuff (17:07 - 17:10)
and new held items but like once I was (17:08 - 17:12)
in it it was just like yep you&#39;re just (17:10 - 17:14)
clicking buttons like the the muscle (17:12 - 17:16)
memory just like went on so like the (17:14 - 17:17)
Mandarin wasn&#39;t like that big of a (17:16 - 17:20)
barrier once I was playing but it was a (17:17 - 17:23)
it was a cool experience you have played (17:20 - 17:27)
enough unite that that worked out pretty (17:23 - 17:32)
well yeah yeah um I think unite is (17:27 - 17:36)
really cool and I I hope that this (17:32 - 17:41)
helps get people back in um like unite (17:36 - 17:43)
is such a fun game to watch but I (17:41 - 17:45)
totally understand why people are like I (17:43 - 17:47)
tried it and it wasn&#39;t for me it&#39;s a MOA (17:45 - 17:50)
like uh and if you like League of (17:47 - 17:52)
Legends you like DOTA it&#39;s probably (17:50 - 17:54)
really hard to pry you away from that (17:52 - 17:58)
moob that mooba um but eventually I (17:54 - 18:00)
think they eventually add your favorite (17:58 - 18:03)
Pokemon and that&#39;s their opportunity to (18:00 - 18:05)
like capture you right that&#39;s like their (18:03 - 18:08)
chance for you to try it and like it so (18:05 - 18:11)
I think they said spring of 2025 for (18:08 - 18:12)
that new (18:11 - 18:14)
mode (18:12 - 18:17)
okay thanks yeah I thought it was (18:14 - 18:20)
interesting though that I that seemed (18:17 - 18:21)
like a we&#39;re going to save this till the (18:20 - 18:26)
very end um so but announcing it like (18:21 - 18:28)
midow was kind of cool and then (18:26 - 18:29)
obviously they announced the three (18:28 - 18:31)
characters at the end so yeah lot of (18:29 - 18:34)
unite news um beautiful beautiful (18:31 - 18:36)
beautiful very good very good okay um it (18:34 - 18:39)
was it was fantastic I had so I cannot (18:36 - 18:40)
probably one of my favorite moments of (18:39 - 18:43)
the weekend was just meeting those guys (18:40 - 18:45)
and they were just fantastic people they (18:43 - 18:48)
were so fun to be around um yeah (18:45 - 18:52)
pocket uh I played pocket play is (18:48 - 18:55)
a (18:52 - 18:59)
stretch very very limited demo yes but (18:55 - 19:02)
this morning they they showed a trailer (18:59 - 19:05)
uh during I think the between like what (19:02 - 19:06)
seniors and Masters or something they (19:05 - 19:08)
showed the trailer of or maybe it was (19:06 - 19:09)
right after Masters they were like (19:08 - 19:10)
pockets (19:09 - 19:14)
coming um they showed more of the game (19:10 - 19:15)
and then in the closing ceremonies they (19:14 - 19:17)
showed the same trailer but they they (19:15 - 19:20)
added then the date which now we know is (19:17 - 19:23)
October 30th for (19:20 - 19:25)
that (19:23 - 19:29)
and playing it again stress (19:25 - 19:33)
uh they the demo station here because it (19:29 - 19:35)
was literally open a pack of cards or (19:33 - 19:37)
open two packs of cards cuz it was very (19:35 - 19:39)
quick uh there was no line is probably (19:37 - 19:41)
the only thing at the convention that (19:39 - 19:42)
didn&#39;t have a line like it did have a (19:41 - 19:44)
line but it went so fast right cuz (19:42 - 19:47)
you&#39;re just opening a pack of cards yeah (19:44 - 19:50)
yeah yeah it was it was when I say no (19:47 - 19:51)
line it wasn&#39;t because people weren&#39;t (19:50 - 19:53)
interested it was just a very quick (19:51 - 19:55)
experience there was like no games or (19:53 - 19:58)
anything to play so um they had two big (19:55 - 20:01)
TVs set up they were like touchscreen (19:58 - 20:03)
TVs uh I I did two videos on unite on (20:01 - 20:06)
like Instagram and Tik Tok of like the (20:03 - 20:07)
big TV and then just the phone obviously (20:06 - 20:09)
the phone experience was much better it (20:07 - 20:11)
looked better it ran better the (20:09 - 20:12)
touchcreen was more responsive like it&#39;s (20:11 - 20:14)
just I get why they did the TV it was (20:12 - 20:16)
just like a bigger eye-catching (20:14 - 20:19)
experience to get you in but I did both (20:16 - 20:21)
it was the same experience I will say I (20:19 - 20:23)
think the packs (20:21 - 20:25)
were I don&#39;t think there was a lot of (20:23 - 20:27)
variety in the packs I think there were (20:25 - 20:29)
I think it was like maybe 10 different (20:27 - 20:30)
packs cuz like a lot of people were (20:29 - 20:33)
getting articunos or or or or gardav (20:30 - 20:35)
Wares it&#39;s like oh we&#39;re all kind of (20:33 - 20:37)
getting the same stuff but (20:35 - 20:40)
uhhuh the the little animations were (20:37 - 20:43)
really cool the one thing there was two (20:40 - 20:45)
two things I noticed uh that I didn&#39;t (20:43 - 20:46)
see other people talking about when (20:45 - 20:48)
you&#39;re swiping through which pack you (20:46 - 20:51)
pick um you can also just turn the pack (20:48 - 20:54)
around and then if you uh open it from (20:51 - 20:56)
behind you can actually just look at the (20:54 - 20:58)
rare first and then skip all the other (20:56 - 21:01)
cards these are five card packs so like (20:58 - 21:04)
Japan uh I don&#39;t I think that&#39;s like (21:01 - 21:05)
final right I don&#39;t think we saw in the (21:04 - 21:07)
trailer that it was going to be like a (21:05 - 21:10)
10 card American pack I don&#39;t I think it (21:07 - 21:12)
was supposed to I think five cards seem (21:10 - 21:14)
like it what it was supposed to be like (21:12 - 21:16)
when I saw okay you opening it I thought (21:14 - 21:19)
like that makes sense the five card (21:16 - 21:23)
pack um yeah and so that was like the (21:19 - 21:24)
little trick was like you could you (21:23 - 21:26)
could technically open Faster by (21:24 - 21:28)
spinning it around um you can like move (21:26 - 21:30)
the cards around to like see the (21:28 - 21:33)
reflection which I technically PTC Joe (21:30 - 21:35)
kind of did that where you could like (21:33 - 21:37)
sway them back and forth to see the (21:35 - 21:40)
sparkle uh and then with the like more (21:37 - 21:43)
fancier cards it&#39;s there&#39;s almost like a (21:40 - 21:45)
3d effect when you move it and then with (21:43 - 21:46)
the like Pikachu card that they showed (21:45 - 21:49)
in the first trailer you can Replay that (21:46 - 21:51)
entire animation just by tapping and (21:49 - 21:52)
holding on the card for a second and (21:51 - 21:54)
then it will like go back into it which (21:52 - 21:56)
is really imersive one yeah the (21:54 - 21:59)
immersive cards I think Pikachu was the (21:56 - 22:01)
only immersive card at the show um again (21:59 - 22:03)
I think there was really only like 10 (22:01 - 22:06)
different packs you could technically (22:03 - 22:09)
open yeah they teased the Mewtwo one (22:06 - 22:12)
though yeah they did cool that looked (22:09 - 22:15)
really cool when you open pack is there (22:12 - 22:17)
tactile feedback like does the phone (22:15 - 22:20)
Buzz yeah yeah yeah it does yeah there (22:17 - 22:22)
was a little vibration to it and there (22:20 - 22:27)
were little noises and and CH chirps and (22:22 - 22:29)
yeah I I think I think DNA is really (22:27 - 22:30)
good at that if we&#39;ve played if you&#39;ve (22:29 - 22:32)
ever played Pokemon Masters I think (22:30 - 22:33)
they&#39;re they&#39;ve been pretty good at (22:32 - 22:37)
like the noise effect of a loot (22:33 - 22:39)
box I didn&#39;t notice this until Bobby (22:37 - 22:42)
mentioned it um until Bobby mentioned it (22:39 - 22:45)
like a week or two ago that like I (22:42 - 22:46)
didn&#39;t think about it and then when you (22:45 - 22:47)
said it I was like I noticed it more (22:46 - 22:49)
that there are going to be cards that (22:47 - 22:52)
just exist in that game that don&#39;t exist (22:49 - 22:55)
in real life like that that Pikachu card (22:52 - 22:58)
and that Mewtwo card are not real cards (22:55 - 23:00)
that&#39;s weird to say cannot yeah they (22:58 - 23:02)
cannot exist in real life like they&#39;re (23:00 - 23:05)
like not real physical cards they could (23:02 - 23:08)
just not in the same way they just don&#39;t (23:05 - 23:10)
yet (23:08 - 23:12)
[Laughter] (23:10 - 23:15)
sure yeah um but (23:12 - 23:17)
the it&#39;s interesting because a lot of (23:15 - 23:20)
the cards they&#39;re still illustrated by (23:17 - 23:25)
TCG artists so um if you look on the uh (23:20 - 23:28)
Apple App Store or the Google Play Store (23:25 - 23:29)
right now you can actually pre-order the (23:28 - 23:31)
app so you can go into the App Store you (23:29 - 23:33)
can pre-order it it&#39;ll then notify you (23:31 - 23:35)
when it is available for download but if (23:33 - 23:38)
you look at the preview images um there (23:35 - 23:40)
are a few cards that I didn&#39;t see being (23:38 - 23:42)
opened at Worlds so there&#39;s like an (23:40 - 23:46)
Eevee card that&#39;s in the preview images (23:42 - 23:48)
and you can see that the artist of the (23:46 - 23:53)
card is soo who does many many TCG like (23:48 - 23:55)
real cards so I do wonder if they&#39;re (23:53 - 23:59)
going to have cards if they aren&#39;t (23:55 - 24:01)
physical cards if now they&#39;re going to (23:59 - 24:02)
have TCG artists who are also doing (24:01 - 24:04)
these cards that are only going to be (24:02 - 24:06)
digital as (24:04 - 24:08)
well because that would be I don&#39;t know (24:06 - 24:09)
I just think it&#39;d be kind of interesting (24:08 - 24:11)
since like these artists do physical (24:09 - 24:14)
cards and I mean obviously digital (24:11 - 24:15)
artwork is a thing it&#39;s not like it&#39;s (24:14 - 24:19)
not but yeah is it is it only going like (24:15 - 24:20)
are they going to turn these cards into (24:19 - 24:22)
real cards are there going to be some (24:20 - 24:24)
that are only in Pocket is there going (24:22 - 24:27)
to be a set down the road that is like (24:24 - 24:29)
pocket themed in you know in the real (24:27 - 24:32)
TCG I feel like I could definitely see (24:29 - 24:34)
that happening yeah you know I mean the (24:32 - 24:37)
other thing is is that the cards they&#39;re (24:34 - 24:41)
not like um they&#39;re not like real TCG (24:37 - 24:42)
they&#39;re not like the they don&#39;t have as (24:41 - 24:45)
many moves on them right like they have (24:42 - 24:47)
like one move or they don&#39;t they&#39;re not (24:45 - 24:49)
as uh I don&#39;t want to say they&#39;re not as (24:47 - 24:50)
complex the moves aren&#39;t as complex as (24:49 - 24:53)
the real game but the game is made to be (24:50 - 24:55)
quicker right the game is made to have (24:53 - 24:57)
quicker matches so like they have moves (24:55 - 24:59)
because they need to have moves cuz they (24:57 - 25:01)
there is a actual battle mode which they (24:59 - 25:04)
kind of showed more of mhm and they (25:01 - 25:05)
mentioned that there will be like (25:04 - 25:07)
playmats you can customize or like get (25:05 - 25:11)
new playmats as like a thing um if you (25:07 - 25:13)
looked at the trailer the bench was only (25:11 - 25:15)
three on the bench instead of six on the (25:13 - 25:17)
bench or sorry five on the bench um it (25:15 - 25:20)
is I&#39;ve only like never playing Marvel (25:17 - 25:22)
snap but seeing Marvel snap and then (25:20 - 25:27)
seeing this next to it it&#39;s 100% Marvel (25:22 - 25:31)
snap yeah I mean they saw the success of (25:27 - 25:33)
Marvel snap and they saw that the (25:31 - 25:36)
Pokemon TCG app that they had out at so (25:33 - 25:39)
far was not that so now they&#39;re making (25:36 - 25:41)
one that is that (25:39 - 25:44)
yeah yeah and I think it&#39;ll do quite (25:41 - 25:47)
well honestly yeah no it looks great I&#39;m (25:44 - 25:49)
still a little bit I mean I guess it&#39;s (25:47 - 25:51)
coming out soon they&#39;re really not (25:49 - 25:53)
showing the battles very much at all and (25:51 - 25:56)
the fact that the demo at Worlds was so (25:53 - 25:59)
limited concerns me a little (25:56 - 26:02)
bit that other world&#39;s demos have not (25:59 - 26:05)
been that limited Pokemon Masters demo (26:02 - 26:09)
or Pokemon scarlet and violet sword and (26:05 - 26:11)
shield demo sword and Sh sword and (26:09 - 26:14)
shield they&#39;ve really focused on from (26:11 - 26:16)
the beginning with pocket they&#39;ve really (26:14 - 26:18)
focused on opening packs they&#39;ve really (26:16 - 26:21)
focused on collecting cards and yes (26:18 - 26:23)
there is a battle element to it and I do (26:21 - 26:26)
think that that is going to be important (26:23 - 26:27)
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s just some kind of (26:26 - 26:30)
like side thing but from the beginning (26:27 - 26:33)
the whole you know you open two packs (26:30 - 26:34)
and they even mentioned right when it (26:33 - 26:36)
was like you free to start you can open (26:34 - 26:38)
two packs a day for free or something (26:36 - 26:39)
like that was how the like even got (26:38 - 26:41)
started but from the beginning the (26:39 - 26:44)
messaging has been really focused on (26:41 - 26:48)
opening packs and so I I understand like (26:44 - 26:50)
I&#39;m not as worried about the fact that (26:48 - 26:53)
like the demo wasn&#39;t showing off more of (26:50 - 26:55)
the game because just because from the (26:53 - 26:57)
very beginning the messaging has really (26:55 - 26:59)
been focused on the opening and (26:57 - 27:03)
collecting part of the game I like that (26:59 - 27:04)
Focus because those are my favorite (27:03 - 27:07)
parts of the TCG I don&#39;t play I barely (27:04 - 27:08)
collect I like looking at the art and (27:07 - 27:11)
opening a pack because it&#39;s fun but if (27:08 - 27:12)
they&#39;re trying to compete with Marvel (27:11 - 27:16)
snap they need to have the battles be a (27:12 - 27:17)
pretty big part of it I feel like I mean (27:16 - 27:19)
I haven&#39;t played it but I&#39;ve seen people (27:17 - 27:21)
get very into it and I know collecting (27:19 - 27:24)
is a very large part but so are the (27:21 - 27:27)
matches right yeah I and I hope that the (27:24 - 27:30)
battling is good good I I you know but I (27:27 - 27:32)
just I&#39;m just saying it doesn&#39;t worry me (27:30 - 27:33)
as much that they were focusing on the (27:32 - 27:35)
collecting aspect because of how much (27:33 - 27:37)
they&#39;ve been pushing that in the (27:35 - 27:38)
marketing and everything kind of leading (27:37 - 27:41)
up to this it versus like me thinking oh (27:38 - 27:42)
they not showing it off because it&#39;s not (27:41 - 27:44)
good or like it&#39;s not ready or something (27:42 - 27:46)
like that it just feels like it&#39;s like (27:44 - 27:49)
well this is this was kind of uh what (27:46 - 27:51)
we&#39;ve been talking about and we just (27:49 - 27:52)
kind of want to really show off the (27:51 - 27:54)
cards right you get to see those the (27:52 - 27:56)
immersive Pikachu things like that (27:54 - 27:59)
are when you&#39;re doing a kind of a (27:56 - 28:00)
quicker demo especially when you have (27:59 - 28:02)
lines of people coming through like you (28:00 - 28:05)
said Steve it was quick because lines of (28:02 - 28:07)
people could run through it but it (28:05 - 28:10)
wasn&#39;t like it had to be five or 10 demo (28:07 - 28:12)
so uh I think that just made it you know (28:10 - 28:14)
easier for that as (28:12 - 28:16)
well I wonder if DNA learned their (28:14 - 28:19)
lesson with Masters I mean like Masters (28:16 - 28:21)
at this point there&#39;s tons of people who (28:19 - 28:23)
love to like battle in Masters and stuff (28:21 - 28:26)
but like Masters battling went (28:23 - 28:29)
from really kind of like battle Focus to (28:26 - 28:31)
this like multiplayer thing and then (28:29 - 28:32)
they kind of like rolled back the (28:31 - 28:34)
multiplayer thing and we&#39;ve never really (28:32 - 28:36)
seen it again uh and you know there were (28:34 - 28:37)
I remember there were there were (28:36 - 28:39)
YouTubers and there were other people in (28:37 - 28:40)
the space that were like when are we (28:39 - 28:42)
going to be able to battle each other or (28:40 - 28:43)
battle real humans or like have like (28:42 - 28:46)
this Le and that never happened but I (28:43 - 28:48)
feel like the messaging around Masters (28:46 - 28:51)
was very much like the battle part and (28:48 - 28:53)
then slowly over time it became more and (28:51 - 28:55)
more of a collecting stuff with like the (28:53 - 28:58)
battling still being reworked and like (28:55 - 29:01)
people do genuinely like it now but it (28:58 - 29:03)
it did Swit it did change direction and (29:01 - 29:04)
I wonder if they don&#39;t want to make this (29:03 - 29:06)
same mistake where they don&#39;t want (29:04 - 29:08)
people to be (29:06 - 29:11)
like the battling is important like (29:08 - 29:13)
again not not that it&#39;s going to be like (29:11 - 29:15)
an afterthought but I think they&#39;re (29:13 - 29:17)
saying the collecting here is important (29:15 - 29:19)
like the collecting in Masters because (29:17 - 29:21)
it makes us the most money as well but (29:19 - 29:24)
also because like this is why you should (29:21 - 29:25)
be coming to the game is to get new (29:24 - 29:29)
cards um and if you want to do something (29:25 - 29:34)
else that&#39;s there um I think they&#39;re I (29:29 - 29:35)
think they&#39;re just playing it a little (29:34 - 29:37)
bit safer with the marketing of this and (29:35 - 29:40)
I think marketing wise is good because (29:37 - 29:42)
it&#39;s really easy to get people to be (29:40 - 29:44)
like do you want to collect stuff the (29:42 - 29:50)
number one game right now is Monopoly go (29:44 - 29:53)
and that is just a collecting thing (29:50 - 29:55)
and is there no actual playing of (29:53 - 29:58)
Monopoly all right I don&#39;t really care (29:55 - 30:00)
um (29:58 - 30:03)
uh Monopoly go is you literally just (30:00 - 30:05)
hold a red button and you can actually (30:03 - 30:08)
like just not even pay attention and (30:05 - 30:10)
it&#39;s it&#39;s mostly collecting it&#39;s it&#39;s (30:08 - 30:13)
it&#39;s at its core it&#39;s it&#39;s the fear of (30:10 - 30:16)
missing out incom completing collecting (30:13 - 30:18)
and sets and that&#39;s fine there&#39;s nothing (30:16 - 30:20)
wrong with I don&#39;t want Pokemon pocket (30:18 - 30:23)
to be that right right right right right (30:20 - 30:26)
I&#39;m just saying that like there are a (30:23 - 30:28)
lot of very popular games out there like (30:26 - 30:31)
Marvel snap like Monopoly go that is (30:28 - 30:34)
easy for people to get into the barrier (30:31 - 30:38)
to entry is so incredibly low and then (30:34 - 30:41)
you as and they get in they open packs (30:38 - 30:43)
they feel good about it ideally they (30:41 - 30:46)
spend more money I&#39;m sure there will be (30:43 - 30:49)
packs that are like this this set is (30:46 - 30:51)
only available for the next two weeks oh (30:49 - 30:53)
yeah and then all of a sudden you get 34 (30:51 - 30:56)
out of 35 cards and you&#39;re like do I buy (30:53 - 30:57)
more packs do I try to find somebody to (30:56 - 30:59)
trade (30:57 - 31:01)
um and I think I think that&#39;s cool like (30:59 - 31:03)
I genuinely think that&#39;s cool like I can (31:01 - 31:06)
imagine myself going to Japan and (31:03 - 31:08)
trading a Japanese karant for an English (31:06 - 31:10)
crar and be like now I can start (31:08 - 31:12)
collecting this set we still don&#39;t know (31:10 - 31:13)
if you have to (31:12 - 31:16)
be that&#39;s a well will will you be able (31:13 - 31:18)
to trade like and actually have (31:16 - 31:20)
different language cards traded to each (31:18 - 31:21)
other I think that&#39;s what they showed in (31:20 - 31:22)
the trailer didn&#39;t they they showed (31:21 - 31:25)
different Lang cards but but like if you (31:22 - 31:27)
if my game is in English will I be able (31:25 - 31:29)
to trade for for a Japanese card or a (31:27 - 31:33)
simplified Chinese card or a Korean card (31:29 - 31:36)
uh I want that that&#39;s a really good (31:33 - 31:38)
question that would be really cool (31:36 - 31:40)
growing up with Pokemon cards it was (31:38 - 31:41)
always really cool to have even just one (31:40 - 31:44)
or two cards in any other language mhm (31:41 - 31:46)
absolutely even now I feel like they (31:44 - 31:47)
have to know that right like that has to (31:46 - 31:50)
be a thing especially like I remember (31:47 - 31:54)
being like a 12 year old and my parents (31:50 - 31:56)
getting me a Japanese booster pack from (31:54 - 31:58)
like a friend of a friend and like I (31:56 - 31:59)
thought like even though those cards (31:58 - 32:02)
were like nothing they were just like a (31:59 - 32:04)
coughing or like a Ponyta I thought they (32:02 - 32:07)
were significantly cooler all of my (32:04 - 32:09)
English cards (32:07 - 32:12)
mhm (32:09 - 32:13)
100% that would be I don&#39;t know where (32:12 - 32:16)
those cards had it in pocket but I I (32:13 - 32:17)
don&#39;t (32:16 - 32:20)
think I I don&#39;t see that happening in (32:17 - 32:23)
pocket but it would be really cool yeah (32:20 - 32:25)
so why I don&#39;t see that happening is (32:23 - 32:28)
because of the battling aspect and it it (32:25 - 32:31)
could get a little bit confusing for the (32:28 - 32:34)
battling aspect unless it just trans (32:31 - 32:37)
card good automatic translate thing that (32:34 - 32:40)
you could just tap on it and turn it (32:37 - 32:43)
from Japanese card into an English card (32:40 - 32:46)
and then I feel like we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re (32:43 - 32:48)
like not giving them too much credit (32:46 - 32:50)
we&#39;re like pushing it further further (32:48 - 32:52)
than it&#39;s like it would just be cool it (32:50 - 32:54)
would be very cool I would assume the (32:52 - 32:56)
cards would be like scarlet and violet (32:54 - 32:59)
like if you have FL Bay there&#39;s only one (32:56 - 33:01)
Pokédex entry for a fay but you can go (32:59 - 33:04)
left and right to see the different (33:01 - 33:07)
colors so like you have the karant card (33:04 - 33:09)
it&#39;s the same crar card for everyone but (33:07 - 33:12)
you could go left and right to see the (33:09 - 33:15)
Japanese the Japanese or the Korean or (33:12 - 33:18)
the would be cool yeah yeah that would (33:15 - 33:20)
be that would be cool (33:18 - 33:23)
that would be different than how it is (33:20 - 33:26)
in real like (33:23 - 33:29)
cards that be there is not enough time (33:26 - 33:32)
in the world to talk about how there was (33:29 - 33:38)
a TCG trade room here at Worlds (33:32 - 33:41)
where I&#39;ll give I&#39;ll give people tune in (33:38 - 33:43)
next week where we&#39;ll spend an hour (33:41 - 33:45)
talking about this but uh at every (33:43 - 33:47)
world&#39;s event or every big event like (33:45 - 33:49)
NAIC there are usually people who bring (33:47 - 33:52)
like a suitcase and they will go to the (33:49 - 33:54)
venue and if they can get a spot in the (33:52 - 33:56)
venue or right outside the venue they (33:54 - 33:57)
will sit down they will open the (33:56 - 34:00)
suitcase and will say this is for sale (33:57 - 34:02)
and people will walk by and they will (34:00 - 34:05)
barter or trade it&#39;s a lot of cards um (34:02 - 34:06)
and people come all over the world for (34:05 - 34:08)
this like people here in yoka there were (34:06 - 34:10)
so many English people in Yokohama there (34:08 - 34:13)
were Japanese and and you know Italian (34:10 - 34:15)
people in London that are like these are (34:13 - 34:17)
the cards I have this is my business I&#39;m (34:15 - 34:18)
not here to watch matches I&#39;m not here (34:17 - 34:21)
to play go I am here to sell you Pokemon (34:18 - 34:25)
cards or buy Pokemon cards and last year (34:21 - 34:27)
we talked about on this podcast how at (34:25 - 34:30)
yok there was a big theft that happened (34:27 - 34:32)
on Sunday and the police were called and (34:30 - 34:34)
all those people that sat there all (34:32 - 34:36)
weekend they lined the halls in Yokohama (34:34 - 34:39)
they were gone on Sunday uh and I get it (34:36 - 34:41)
from like a corporation perspective you (34:39 - 34:43)
probably don&#39;t want the police at your (34:41 - 34:46)
event um and also from like a safety (34:43 - 34:47)
perspective you don&#39;t want your (34:46 - 34:51)
attendees to be getting stuff stolen uh (34:47 - 34:56)
at your convention um but at a even if (34:51 - 34:58)
it&#39;s not happening in the convention (34:56 - 35:01)
down the street is not the convention or (34:58 - 35:02)
around the corner is not the convention (35:01 - 35:04)
so you really can&#39;t stop these people (35:02 - 35:08)
from showing up um so I did talk to a (35:04 - 35:10)
guy who had a there so Pokemon set up a (35:08 - 35:11)
dedicated room I think there was a room (35:10 - 35:15)
last year too um but I never saw it also (35:11 - 35:17)
last year was like a million times (35:15 - 35:19)
bigger than this one because one we&#39;re (35:17 - 35:21)
on a very small island and two it&#39;s not (35:19 - 35:23)
Japan (35:21 - 35:27)
but uh they had a room where you could (35:23 - 35:28)
ultimately do the same thing and I asked (35:27 - 35:30)
I was like can you rent the tables here (35:28 - 35:31)
though they&#39;re like the tables are free (35:30 - 35:32)
you just kind of have to like fill out a (35:31 - 35:35)
form and and setup shop but they was no (35:32 - 35:38)
money no venmo no PayPal no actual cash (35:35 - 35:41)
could be exchanged in this room oh so (35:38 - 35:42)
people could walk in the room and say I (35:41 - 35:45)
want this $200 card but now I have to (35:42 - 35:47)
come up with either $200 worth of (35:45 - 35:51)
merchandise or $200 worth of other cards (35:47 - 35:54)
to then initiate that trade in that (35:51 - 35:58)
room that&#39;s and in that room I saw (35:54 - 36:00)
people exchanging cash even though I was (35:58 - 36:02)
told if we see you exchanging cash we (36:00 - 36:04)
will not only kick you from the room we (36:02 - 36:07)
will take your badge away completely and (36:04 - 36:10)
you will not get back in the building so (36:07 - 36:13)
I want to talk more about that um but (36:10 - 36:15)
for as a customer as somebody walking (36:13 - 36:17)
through the room and seeing things I was (36:15 - 36:19)
like oh that car I would like that card (36:17 - 36:21)
it&#39;s priced at like (36:19 - 36:26)
$5 I I don&#39;t have anything to give you I (36:21 - 36:27)
didn&#39;t know that you were going to be (36:26 - 36:30)
here I didn&#39;t bring a binder of cards I (36:27 - 36:32)
I didn&#39;t I I guess I could go into the (36:30 - 36:34)
Pokemon Center and like buy a backpack (36:32 - 36:35)
and then come back and be like if this (36:34 - 36:37)
backpack&#39;s worth (36:35 - 36:41)
more this is why money exists to some (36:37 - 36:43)
extent yeah so and some of the people (36:41 - 36:45)
were like yeah I&#39;m doing today in the (36:43 - 36:48)
hall I&#39;m doing tomorrow outside cuz I&#39;m (36:45 - 36:49)
trying to get more stuff and I&#39;m trying (36:48 - 36:52)
to see if this is working but I feel (36:49 - 36:57)
like the Pokemon company is so close to (36:52 - 37:00)
like making this a better solution but (36:57 - 37:06)
also like a safer solution mhm um yeah (37:00 - 37:08)
and I guess this can kind of transition (37:06 - 37:09)
again we can talk about this next week (37:08 - 37:12)
how Pokemon Center was a disaster not (37:09 - 37:15)
from the Pokemon perspective like you&#39;re (37:12 - 37:17)
never going to have enough merch for (37:15 - 37:18)
everyone you&#39;re never going to be able (37:17 - 37:21)
to satisfy everyone&#39;s needs like they (37:18 - 37:23)
made 750 bar Walker skateboards and they (37:21 - 37:25)
were really popular and really sought (37:23 - 37:28)
after making 1500 I don&#39;t think solves (37:25 - 37:31)
that problem making 3,000 maybe like at (37:28 - 37:32)
that point maybe no one cares because (37:31 - 37:34)
there&#39;s just too many right like I don&#39;t (37:32 - 37:37)
sply demand of items is very weird like (37:34 - 37:38)
I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how you solve this (37:37 - 37:39)
problem (37:38 - 37:42)
but everything around the Pokemon Center (37:39 - 37:45)
wasn&#39;t like the Pokemon company&#39;s fault (37:42 - 37:49)
like people were getting in line 3 to (37:45 - 37:52)
four hours early outside for their time (37:49 - 37:54)
slot and other people would show up for (37:52 - 37:56)
their time slot and get in line behind (37:54 - 37:59)
all of these people that have (37:56 - 38:01)
their appointment&#39;s not happening and (37:59 - 38:02)
these people with the appointment they&#39; (38:01 - 38:04)
get to the front of the line and the (38:02 - 38:05)
people at the front of the line would (38:04 - 38:06)
check say what&#39;s your appointment at (38:05 - 38:09)
they would say oh like 6 o&#39;clock okay (38:06 - 38:11)
it&#39;s 3:00 go to the end of the line like (38:09 - 38:14)
we&#39;re not like no one got in early at (38:11 - 38:17)
all like there was the the security here (38:14 - 38:18)
compared to other worlds was so (38:17 - 38:20)
heightened and I think it was because of (38:18 - 38:22)
some of the issues at Yokohama that we (38:20 - 38:23)
talked about there was a fist fight in (38:22 - 38:25)
the Yokohama Pokémon Center last year (38:23 - 38:27)
over a bear Walker skateboard that (38:25 - 38:28)
happened this year too by the way like (38:27 - 38:30)
there was another there was multiple (38:28 - 38:31)
fights inside the Pokemon Center happens (38:30 - 38:34)
anytime there are big crowds of people (38:31 - 38:36)
anywhere yeah it happens it happens at (38:34 - 38:39)
Comic just a human problem like yeah (38:36 - 38:40)
right that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not I&#39;m (38:39 - 38:42)
not trying to defend the Pokemon company (38:40 - 38:45)
but it&#39;s like that&#39;s a human problem (38:42 - 38:48)
that&#39;s not like their specific problem (38:45 - 38:51)
right so uh yeah and you there were (38:48 - 38:54)
people um going up and down being like (38:51 - 38:55)
what&#39;s your time what&#39;s your time what&#39;s (38:54 - 38:57)
your time if if if your time is like 3 (38:55 - 39:00)
3:30 we&#39;re going to move you over here (38:57 - 39:02)
if your time is 6:00 get to the back (39:00 - 39:06)
like just leave the line um and even (39:02 - 39:08)
when these people were told like just (39:06 - 39:10)
come back at your appointment we will (39:08 - 39:11)
get we will send you up the stairs (39:10 - 39:13)
literally at your appointment time (39:11 - 39:15)
that&#39;s why you have an appointment time (39:13 - 39:18)
they wouldn&#39;t leave the line they just (39:15 - 39:20)
it was it reminded me so much of the (39:18 - 39:23)
very first go Fest where Niantic like (39:20 - 39:25)
nothing worked at the first go Fest and (39:23 - 39:27)
then John hanky got on stage and was (39:25 - 39:28)
like we&#39;re really sorry we&#39;re giving you (39:27 - 39:30)
all $1100 we&#39;re refunding your tickets (39:28 - 39:33)
also we fixed the game just leave the (39:30 - 39:35)
park and there were hundreds and (39:33 - 39:36)
thousands of people in the park I stayed (39:35 - 39:38)
in the park because I was like I was (39:36 - 39:39)
interviewing people and I was shooting (39:38 - 39:41)
footage and I wasn&#39;t like really playing (39:39 - 39:42)
so I was like I&#39;m in the park I&#39;m doing (39:41 - 39:44)
stuff like I&#39;m doing business in the (39:42 - 39:46)
park and all of these people around me (39:44 - 39:47)
were just complaining that the game (39:46 - 39:50)
wasn&#39;t working and they were so scared (39:47 - 39:53)
to leave and when you hear of like the (39:50 - 39:54)
horror stories of the first go Fest it&#39;s (39:53 - 39:56)
these people that just refuse to listen (39:54 - 39:59)
like literally if you one block outside (39:56 - 40:02)
the Park the game will work flawlessly (39:59 - 40:04)
please leave and they said multiple (40:02 - 40:05)
times over the announcements while I was (40:04 - 40:07)
in the park please leave the park please (40:05 - 40:08)
leave the park you&#39;re we promise the (40:07 - 40:10)
game will be better and it&#39;s the same (40:08 - 40:12)
thing here at this Pokemon Center just (40:10 - 40:15)
come back at 4 o&#39;clock you will go right (40:12 - 40:18)
up the stairs at 4 o&#39;clock and all (40:15 - 40:21)
weekend no one would leave the line even (40:18 - 40:23)
though every 10 minutes they were (40:21 - 40:25)
checking time and telling people to (40:23 - 40:28)
leave and moving people away (40:25 - 40:30)
it&#39;s the same people from the first goof (40:28 - 40:35)
Fest they all traveled to this world in (40:30 - 40:35)
Hawaii definitely the same mindset was (40:35 - 40:43)
the line outside also in the sun yeah so (40:38 - 40:46)
there were no no the line was uh in this (40:43 - 40:48)
beautiful like uh shaded area right next (40:46 - 40:52)
to the canal um is at least good yeah (40:48 - 40:54)
and that&#39;s where the um that&#39;s where the (40:52 - 40:57)
suitcases also lined up because it was (40:54 - 40:59)
the front and the end of the Pokemon (40:57 - 41:01)
Center there so you would line up (40:59 - 41:02)
outside for your time when it was (41:01 - 41:05)
exactly your time so I went I will P (41:02 - 41:07)
disclosure I got in on (41:05 - 41:10)
Wednesday the media the press and then (41:07 - 41:13)
Pokemon it was like media press Pokemon (41:10 - 41:16)
staff got to shop on Wednesday morning (41:13 - 41:18)
so I was part of that everything I (41:16 - 41:19)
bought in the Pokemon Center I paid for (41:18 - 41:21)
that YouTube video is up like I bought (41:19 - 41:24)
like $300 worth of stuff um and I got (41:21 - 41:25)
everything I wanted right like I didn&#39;t (41:24 - 41:27)
want the bear Walker skateboard I didn&#39;t (41:25 - 41:28)
really want a lot of clothes I got (41:27 - 41:29)
everything I wanted and then the next (41:28 - 41:34)
day my friend had a um like a 3:00 and (41:29 - 41:36)
we got there at 3:10 and I was like I (41:34 - 41:37)
want to I want to see I want to (41:36 - 41:39)
experience this because I I get (41:37 - 41:41)
unprivileged but and I get like ah Steve (41:39 - 41:43)
gets everything he wants he he was able (41:41 - 41:44)
to do it I was like I want to know what (41:43 - 41:48)
a normal person who bought a ticket a (41:44 - 41:50)
normal person sounds weird I (41:48 - 41:53)
want average attendee I want to know (41:50 - 41:55)
what an average attendee has to go (41:53 - 41:56)
through because I think that&#39;s the fair (41:55 - 41:57)
way to like talk about this on the (41:56 - 41:58)
podcast (41:57 - 41:59)
and we got there like we got there 5 (41:58 - 42:01)
minutes late his appointment was at 3 we (41:59 - 42:04)
got there at 3:5 and right away they (42:01 - 42:05)
were like you skip this whole line (42:04 - 42:08)
3:00&#39;s already went in go up there so we (42:05 - 42:10)
went in we went all up all these stairs (42:08 - 42:12)
and then they put us in a parking garage (42:10 - 42:15)
this sounds really weird uh so the (42:12 - 42:16)
second part of the queue was in a (42:15 - 42:21)
parking garage that they emptied out and (42:16 - 42:23)
in the parking garage they broke it into (42:21 - 42:26)
four sections and that was the second (42:23 - 42:29)
part of the section so it would be like (42:26 - 42:31)
for example section A would be 3:00 SE (42:29 - 42:34)
SE section B would be 3:15 section c (42:31 - 42:37)
would be 3:30 and then section and so it (42:34 - 42:38)
almost kind of felt like we were cattle (42:37 - 42:39)
because there was like Gates they would (42:38 - 42:41)
open and then we would move forward in (42:39 - 42:44)
the next SE section right like 3 3 (42:41 - 42:46)
o&#39;clock went in so 3:30 moves behind it (42:44 - 42:49)
3:15 went in so 345 moves behind it and (42:46 - 42:51)
then they they they stock the back (42:49 - 42:53)
cattle but because it was in a parking (42:51 - 42:55)
garage one kind of smelled like a (42:53 - 42:57)
parking garage and two it was kind of (42:55 - 43:00)
muggy so that like if you walked in you (42:57 - 43:02)
saw like you saw like 40 fans that were (43:00 - 43:05)
clearly purchased from a local Walmart (43:02 - 43:07)
go like Fanning everyone and then they (43:05 - 43:09)
were going up and down giving everyone (43:07 - 43:12)
bottles of water got it so a better (43:09 - 43:15)
experience overall than (43:12 - 43:18)
Yokohama um because I don&#39;t think they (43:15 - 43:20)
were doing water at Yokohama and (43:18 - 43:21)
Yokohama was like you were standing (43:20 - 43:24)
directly in the sun until you got inside (43:21 - 43:25)
where then they moved you into (43:24 - 43:27)
conference rooms and then conference (43:25 - 43:28)
rooms were air conditioning but then (43:27 - 43:29)
they would move you into the Pokemon (43:28 - 43:33)
Center so it was outside parking garage (43:29 - 43:34)
and then the final line that you got (43:33 - 43:36)
into there was another there&#39;s three (43:34 - 43:38)
lines the final line you got into was (43:36 - 43:40)
where it wrapped around and you could (43:38 - 43:42)
see like the Halloween merch and then (43:40 - 43:43)
there was a photo opportunity in the (43:42 - 43:46)
middle of the line where because you&#39;re (43:43 - 43:48)
in a line so when you got slowly moved (43:46 - 43:50)
up you take a photo and then Pikachu and (43:48 - 43:52)
then there would be like Hawaiian (43:50 - 43:53)
dancers at the end of the line so there (43:52 - 43:55)
was like music and there was like (43:53 - 43:56)
Pikachu there and there was like things (43:55 - 43:59)
to see in the final part of the line and (43:56 - 44:01)
then you got into the Pokemon (43:59 - 44:03)
Center and then people were fist (44:01 - 44:05)
fighting each other over at (44:03 - 44:11)
ukulele it&#39;s as you do as as as you (44:05 - 44:11)
would the I don&#39;t know if they added (44:11 - 44:16)
more Security on the inside but there (44:15 - 44:19)
was it was more lines on the inside like (44:16 - 44:20)
lines for specific products like (44:19 - 44:23)
backpacks or or like dice boxes but the (44:20 - 44:25)
people in charge of the lines were like (44:23 - 44:27)
if we see you push anyone if we see you (44:25 - 44:30)
cut a line if we see you be rude to (44:27 - 44:32)
somebody else you will be escorted out (44:30 - 44:34)
of this with no merchandise at all like (44:32 - 44:36)
there was no tolerance for anything on (44:34 - 44:39)
the last day which maybe they have to do (44:36 - 44:42)
that all four days I&#39;m not sure like or (44:39 - 44:44)
maybe it just got worse if there yeah if (44:42 - 44:47)
there are more fights breaking out or (44:44 - 44:49)
just more uh problems happening (44:47 - 44:51)
throughout the weekend then they have to (44:49 - 44:53)
start ramping up the you know the (44:51 - 44:55)
enforcement of the rules that are (44:53 - 44:58)
probably there the whole time but (44:55 - 44:59)
yeah but it&#39;s like the the van go thing (44:58 - 45:02)
again you know like the fact that you (44:59 - 45:05)
have to tell people like don&#39;t run and (45:02 - 45:08)
trample over kids or families just (45:05 - 45:12)
because you want a backpack is like just (45:08 - 45:15)
act like a good person just like be I (45:12 - 45:18)
get that you&#39;re excited or you want this (45:15 - 45:21)
but it sucks that like a couple people (45:18 - 45:22)
have (45:21 - 45:25)
ruined yeah just like an experience for (45:22 - 45:29)
everyone yeah I mean it&#39;s tough when you (45:25 - 45:31)
have these like popup stores right I (45:29 - 45:33)
mean this is not here all the time this (45:31 - 45:35)
is here this weekend and there&#39;s all (45:33 - 45:38)
these people here and yeah you know and (45:35 - 45:40)
they&#39;re doing so much merch so they (45:38 - 45:43)
can&#39;t do what people do it I think (45:40 - 45:45)
concerts I&#39;ve never been to a concert (45:43 - 45:46)
like this but the stands that have all (45:45 - 45:48)
the t-shirts and the sweatshirts and all (45:46 - 45:49)
of that where you just go up and you (45:48 - 45:51)
talk to the person and you you just (45:49 - 45:52)
basically order everything you&#39;re (45:51 - 45:54)
looking for with the Pokemon store (45:52 - 45:56)
there&#39;s just too much yeah you can&#39;t you (45:54 - 45:57)
can&#39;t do that (45:56 - 46:00)
that kind of they had the they had the (45:57 - 46:02)
be Walker skateboards and the ukulele (46:00 - 46:04)
like that situation Hannah you had to (46:02 - 46:05)
walk up to somebody separate right say (46:04 - 46:07)
what you wanted they did really good job (46:05 - 46:10)
with limits like limit one like like (46:07 - 46:11)
that that was the feedback I gave at (46:10 - 46:13)
Yokohama it was the same feedback I gave (46:11 - 46:15)
at London I was like you need limit (46:13 - 46:17)
signs like when I went to London I (46:15 - 46:19)
watched a guy reach in scoop up as many (46:17 - 46:22)
Roselia and Pikachu plushes and then (46:19 - 46:23)
walk to the door when I got there on (46:22 - 46:25)
London it was fully stocked literally (46:23 - 46:28)
that same day completely empty (46:25 - 46:30)
and the first thing I noticed in (46:28 - 46:31)
Yokohama when I walk through is like I&#39;m (46:30 - 46:33)
not seeing limits on anything like these (46:31 - 46:36)
things need limits um and when I walked (46:33 - 46:38)
in there very obvious everything was (46:36 - 46:42)
limit one or limit two uh and that&#39;s how (46:38 - 46:43)
it should be honestly like you should (46:42 - 46:45)
limit everything just to one and then if (46:43 - 46:47)
you have more and more stuff throughout (46:45 - 46:49)
the weekend just then you increase the (46:47 - 46:51)
limit like ah we have too many real lose (46:49 - 46:53)
let&#39;s increase the limit to two or three (46:51 - 46:54)
at this point like because of course (46:53 - 46:56)
they they want to leave this island (46:54 - 46:58)
without they don&#39;t want to take anything (46:56 - 46:59)
back right the goal is to sell (46:58 - 47:01)
everything yeah they need to sell (46:59 - 47:03)
everything that&#39;s yeah point oh they (47:01 - 47:04)
definitely they definitely sold (47:03 - 47:07)
everything that&#39;s that&#39;s sure they I&#39;m (47:04 - 47:08)
sure they did when people think of like (47:07 - 47:11)
the number one media franchise in the (47:08 - 47:14)
world the Pokemon Center is why it&#39;s (47:11 - 47:16)
they they went through everything um I (47:14 - 47:18)
think I think the Pokemon Center is just (47:16 - 47:21)
so cool it&#39;s it&#39;s such a cool experience (47:18 - 47:23)
like the Merch this year was really (47:21 - 47:25)
great everything was like fantastic um (47:23 - 47:27)
it&#39;s just like the only bad thing was (47:25 - 47:31)
the actual people people being (47:27 - 47:34)
people yeah yeah that&#39;s I mean that is (47:31 - 47:36)
unfor they&#39;re trying to work around that (47:34 - 47:40)
as best they can it seems like yeah in (47:36 - 47:42)
in a limited time frame like in there&#39;s (47:40 - 47:44)
so much going on it sounds like they (47:42 - 47:47)
really are doing the best they can but (47:44 - 47:49)
yeah humans are humans and you know (47:47 - 47:51)
those things are going to happen and it (47:49 - 47:53)
I mean if to be honest if you only heard (47:51 - 47:56)
about it happening once it&#39;s not like (47:53 - 47:58)
people were reselling bear Walker (47:56 - 48:00)
skateboards all weekend like you know so (47:58 - 48:02)
it&#39;s like oh there was one that was (48:00 - 48:04)
happening but I mean that&#39;s not what I (48:02 - 48:08)
mean yeah I&#39;m making a point here uh so (48:04 - 48:09)
it you know if you&#39;re saying like one (48:08 - 48:13)
time we heard about this person who sold (48:09 - 48:15)
you know grabbed the board and then sold (48:13 - 48:17)
it resold it in the store right away (48:15 - 48:19)
that&#39;s not an not an unsurprising thing (48:17 - 48:22)
and so if you&#39;re saying like you only (48:19 - 48:24)
you heard about it once like that&#39;s (48:22 - 48:25)
actually in my head I&#39;m thinking like (48:24 - 48:27)
that&#39;s actually pretty good cuz like I (48:25 - 48:29)
could see that happening like every hour (48:27 - 48:31)
yeah no that&#39;s an opportunity for free (48:29 - 48:34)
money right there yeah totally yeah I (48:31 - 48:36)
will say um convention wise before we I (48:34 - 48:37)
think the last thing we have to talk (48:36 - 48:40)
about is the other TCG stuff right we (48:37 - 48:42)
went through pocket unite go and then (48:40 - 48:44)
the final announcement was like the (48:42 - 48:46)
physical TCG stuff I think oh well TCG (48:44 - 48:50)
and then the the the next locations yeah (48:46 - 48:51)
those are important I think like this (48:50 - 48:55)
worlds was pretty flawf free um besides (48:51 - 48:56)
like the Pokemon Center stuff was (48:55 - 48:59)
actually like the biggest like complaint (48:56 - 49:02)
but we just talked about why that was um (48:59 - 49:05)
the venue itself was like smaller and I (49:02 - 49:07)
think you know a year ago when we when I (49:05 - 49:09)
recorded in Yokohama at like 400 a.m. (49:07 - 49:10)
and I don&#39;t even know what time it was (49:09 - 49:12)
for you guys it was like 6:00 a or (49:10 - 49:14)
something I don&#39;t when when we did that (49:12 - 49:19)
recording yeah um I and they announced (49:14 - 49:21)
Hawaii I wasn&#39;t initially excited (49:19 - 49:24)
because um well also bad timing with the (49:21 - 49:27)
the fires as well but uh I wasn&#39;t (49:24 - 49:30)
initially excited because I Hawaii has (49:27 - 49:32)
never seemed like I need to go there (49:30 - 49:34)
kind of place like there&#39;s other places (49:32 - 49:35)
I would like to travel to or other (49:34 - 49:37)
places I would like to return to but (49:35 - 49:39)
also like logistically I was like I (49:37 - 49:42)
don&#39;t know how you make worlds bigger (49:39 - 49:45)
and bigger every year after Japan like (49:42 - 49:51)
all of Yokohama was Pikachu fied um and (49:45 - 49:52)
it seemed like it was pretty big in (49:51 - 49:53)
London (49:52 - 49:57)
too yeah I mean the Excel Center is (49:53 - 49:59)
gigantic and that was first year back (49:57 - 50:02)
right after after two years out yeah so (49:59 - 50:04)
like that was just huge and (50:02 - 50:08)
it&#39;s I think um things to do wise I (50:04 - 50:09)
think there was probably more in Hawaii (50:08 - 50:11)
it was pretty much broken up into two (50:09 - 50:13)
things there was the the like Hilton (50:11 - 50:16)
Hawaiian Village was like one section of (50:13 - 50:18)
Worlds and then there was the Convention (50:16 - 50:19)
Center Park and they did a really good (50:18 - 50:21)
job with like I think they had eight (50:19 - 50:23)
trolleys running between the two which (50:21 - 50:26)
was free for anyone and if you were on (50:23 - 50:28)
the trolley it would take uh I think I (50:26 - 50:29)
timed it it would be about 6 to seven (50:28 - 50:31)
minutes depending on traffic to get (50:29 - 50:33)
between the two and they were running (50:31 - 50:35)
non-stop I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever waited (50:33 - 50:36)
more than five minutes for a trolley to (50:35 - 50:40)
show up and uh if you walked between the (50:36 - 50:44)
two it was about 15 minutes walking uh (50:40 - 50:46)
and that was actually an official route (50:44 - 50:49)
by Niantic to go from the convention to (50:46 - 50:52)
the the Hawaiian um Hilton (50:49 - 50:57)
area and I think like (50:52 - 51:00)
it was definitely like no debate so much (50:57 - 51:02)
smaller than Japan because you could (51:00 - 51:05)
probably do everything if you sp sped (51:02 - 51:06)
run it (51:05 - 51:09)
like maybe not the Pokemon Center but (51:06 - 51:10)
like besides the Pokemon Center you (51:09 - 51:13)
could probably like like do everything (51:10 - 51:15)
within a couple hours where like Japan (51:13 - 51:16)
it felt (51:15 - 51:20)
like Japan it felt like there was so (51:16 - 51:23)
much to do that you couldn&#39;t do it all (51:20 - 51:24)
and then the next day you would be like (51:23 - 51:26)
I didn&#39;t even know that was happening or (51:24 - 51:28)
I didn&#39;t even know was (51:26 - 51:30)
there sounded like you couldn&#39;t get it (51:28 - 51:33)
all into one weekend yeah they had a map (51:30 - 51:35)
this time uh and it was it was super (51:33 - 51:38)
laid out I from what I&#39;ve been told the (51:35 - 51:40)
part of the reasons for this was Japan (51:38 - 51:43)
was run by the Pokemon company and this (51:40 - 51:45)
was run by the Pokemon company (51:43 - 51:47)
International so there is different (51:45 - 51:50)
Logistics in (51:47 - 51:53)
that um the map was really great uh they (51:50 - 51:55)
had plenty of meet and greets they had a (51:53 - 51:57)
drone show every night which was like (51:55 - 51:59)
not every night there was drone show (51:57 - 52:01)
fireworks drone show drone show (51:59 - 52:04)
absolutely fantastic that I for I&#39;ve (52:01 - 52:05)
been told that that they just do (52:04 - 52:07)
fireworks on Friday nights on at that (52:05 - 52:11)
specific Resort got it it&#39;s just every (52:07 - 52:13)
Friday night apparently they do it um (52:11 - 52:18)
they had like a uh an the top 100 (52:13 - 52:22)
illustrator room which is super cool (52:18 - 52:25)
they had a museum room of like old (52:22 - 52:28)
world&#39;s merchandise which was fantastic (52:25 - 52:32)
that&#39;s really cool they had the geni the (52:28 - 52:35)
geni ballroom which was uh Pokemon (52:32 - 52:39)
partnering with Genki uh and their goal (52:35 - 52:42)
was to so I wish I could explain I&#39;m G (52:39 - 52:45)
to not sell this as should as good as I (52:42 - 52:46)
should but ultimately what they do is (52:45 - 52:51)
they take mud uh or trash and they (52:46 - 52:54)
squish it into like a ball uh and then (52:51 - 52:55)
something happens that&#39;s the part I (52:54 - 52:57)
can&#39;t explain but then they throw it (52:55 - 52:58)
into the ocean or they throw it into (52:57 - 53:01)
water and good (52:58 - 53:04)
prootic biotic good bacteria gets (53:01 - 53:06)
released and then (53:04 - 53:09)
cleans the water so you could go in and (53:06 - 53:12)
make a mud ball and they and they had (53:09 - 53:13)
like little shape so you can actually (53:12 - 53:16)
make a Pokeball mud ball um and they (53:13 - 53:21)
made 3,000 of them within 48 hours and (53:16 - 53:24)
then on Saturday evening they had people (53:21 - 53:27)
who wanted to line up the canal and then (53:24 - 53:29)
we all threw the mud balls into the (53:27 - 53:33)
canal to help clean the (53:29 - 53:36)
canal that&#39;s wild okay yeah it was (53:33 - 53:38)
really cool and again I I feel like I&#39;ve (53:36 - 53:40)
explained it poorly but it was a good (53:38 - 53:42)
thing for the environment and the water (53:40 - 53:46)
yeah that that part made sense I still (53:42 - 53:47)
it&#39;s wild it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve seen (53:46 - 53:50)
before but that at least yes if you if (53:47 - 53:52)
you were to like maybe I&#39;ll like I&#39;ll (53:50 - 53:54)
highlight the section of my twitch VOD (53:52 - 53:55)
where they&#39;re like actually explaining (53:54 - 53:57)
it properly cuz I like recorded that (53:55 - 53:59)
then you can see everyone throw it in (53:57 - 54:01)
the water at the same time it was like (53:59 - 54:04)
really really cool um that&#39;s cool when (54:01 - 54:05)
she explained it was very long-winded (54:04 - 54:07)
she was she was very passionate about it (54:05 - 54:08)
but she kept talking and talking and (54:07 - 54:09)
everyone&#39;s like we just want to throw (54:08 - 54:12)
the (54:09 - 54:12)
balls watching like a hundred people (54:13 - 54:17)
throw mud balls at the same time and (54:15 - 54:20)
into the water was very cool it was it (54:17 - 54:22)
was (54:20 - 54:22)
awesome the whole event was good and I I (54:23 - 54:27)
think I probably have to formulate more (54:25 - 54:31)
thoughts about it but um really I was (54:27 - 54:32)
like thinking of like what what like (54:31 - 54:34)
went wrong or what like didn&#39;t feel (54:32 - 54:36)
right I guess you could complain that it (54:34 - 54:39)
was like smaller but I don&#39;t think (54:36 - 54:41)
that&#39;s necessarily a bad thing because (54:39 - 54:44)
at the same time I like bad thing no (54:41 - 54:46)
like I I felt like I did everything and (54:44 - 54:49)
that felt good versus Japan where I felt (54:46 - 54:52)
like gosh I like I wish somebody told me (54:49 - 54:54)
this was happening because like if I (54:52 - 54:55)
knew I would have done it and now I like (54:54 - 54:57)
I feel kind of like (54:55 - 54:59)
I missed out on something cool because (54:57 - 55:03)
like I just didn&#39;t know it existed yeah (54:59 - 55:05)
right we knew that the (55:03 - 55:08)
2026 date was or the location was (55:05 - 55:10)
revealed because (55:08 - 55:14)
some guy just was casually said it some (55:10 - 55:18)
employees said it to reporter uh and so (55:14 - 55:20)
they announced next year&#39;s location so (55:18 - 55:22)
20125 will be in (55:20 - 55:25)
Anaheim and at the same time they were (55:22 - 55:27)
also like you know what we&#39;re going to (55:25 - 55:29)
give you 2026 as well which is San (55:27 - 55:31)
Francisco which we knew which was a (55:29 - 55:34)
crazy good power play by them yeah but (55:31 - 55:36)
then to top it off they gave us dates (55:34 - 55:39)
for both M locations so which is (55:36 - 55:41)
incredible which is awesome they&#39;re both (55:39 - 55:43)
in August do we have the dates available (55:41 - 55:46)
right here the next year is the 15th the (55:43 - 55:49)
a it&#39;s August 15th through the 17th does (55:46 - 55:51)
that does it being in California that&#39;s (55:49 - 55:54)
easy for Bobby super easy for Bobby (55:51 - 55:56)
Hannah does being in California make (55:54 - 55:59)
that easy wonderful uh it&#39;s not (55:56 - 56:01)
particularly close in California (55:59 - 56:05)
California is a big state um it&#39;s still (56:01 - 56:08)
not a super close flight but it&#39;s it&#39;s (56:05 - 56:11)
fine I mean it&#39;s basically Disneyland (56:08 - 56:13)
land as far as I can tell that&#39;s the (56:11 - 56:15)
only reason I ever hear about Anaheim (56:13 - 56:18)
that next year there it&#39;s it&#39;s in Orange (56:15 - 56:20)
County right between Los Angeles and San (56:18 - 56:22)
Diego yeah and it&#39;s Disneyland I mean (56:20 - 56:25)
that&#39;s why everybody goes to Anaheim so (56:22 - 56:27)
sounds busy sounds expensive well it&#39;s (56:25 - 56:30)
can&#39;t be expensive as Hawaii Anaheim is (56:27 - 56:34)
not that expensive compared to Los (56:30 - 56:36)
Angeles okay I&#39;m one of those kids who (56:34 - 56:38)
never went to Disneyland so I don&#39;t know (56:36 - 56:40)
how expensive things are so Disneyland (56:38 - 56:43)
itself is expensive but Anaheim there&#39;s (56:40 - 56:45)
a lot of area around Disneyland that (56:43 - 56:48)
Anaheim encompasses so I mean you you (56:45 - 56:49)
know you there&#39;s plenty of places to (56:48 - 56:51)
stay I don&#39;t remember they didn&#39;t say (56:49 - 56:53)
where in Anaheim it was going to be (56:51 - 56:56)
right they zoomed in I think on the (56:53 - 56:58)
convention center but I didn&#39;t see the (56:56 - 57:01)
name yeah there&#39;s only one conven Center (56:58 - 57:04)
then it&#39;s that right near Disneyland so (57:01 - 57:05)
um yeah you know you would know better (57:04 - 57:07)
than us Bobby I&#39;ve I&#39;ve I don&#39;t think (57:05 - 57:10)
I&#39;ve been you&#39;ve been to Anaheim because (57:07 - 57:12)
you&#39;ve been to downtown Disney this year (57:10 - 57:14)
oh is that where that was yes okay that (57:12 - 57:16)
was the gates of Disneyland we stood out (57:14 - 57:18)
the side of Disneyland and took a (57:16 - 57:20)
picture we did oh yeah right between (57:18 - 57:22)
California Adventure in Disneyland we (57:20 - 57:24)
took a picture just assumed that was (57:22 - 57:26)
like I didn&#39;t know that was Anaheim (57:24 - 57:27)
Anaheim (57:26 - 57:30)
yeah that&#39;s the Anaheim it&#39;s it&#39;s all (57:27 - 57:32)
kind of crammed into one place there I (57:30 - 57:34)
feel like when you look at it on a map (57:32 - 57:36)
yeah when you are not familiar with the (57:34 - 57:38)
area and you&#39;re all zoomed out because (57:36 - 57:40)
it&#39;s a really big area everything&#39;s (57:38 - 57:43)
right next to each other yeah yeah well (57:40 - 57:46)
but yeah you were there Steve (57:43 - 57:50)
so okay um well uh we have we&#39;re very (57:46 - 57:52)
limited on time we&#39;ve we&#39;ve hit our hour (57:50 - 57:54)
threshold uh there was the TCG (57:52 - 57:56)
announcement where they announced um the (57:54 - 57:58)
trainer cards which I think we kind of (57:56 - 58:00)
knew were coming based off some Japanese (57:58 - 58:01)
stuff and then the Team Rocket stuff (58:00 - 58:04)
they kind of hinted at at the very end (58:01 - 58:06)
uh there will probably be actually an (58:04 - 58:07)
official press release the next time we (58:06 - 58:09)
record that we can go through but the (58:07 - 58:11)
Pokemon company got me this room last (58:09 - 58:13)
minute because of the E ethernet (58:11 - 58:15)
Internet situation uh and now they&#39;re (58:13 - 58:17)
trying to shut down the convention so I (58:15 - 58:19)
