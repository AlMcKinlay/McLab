[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 420 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj here recording on a friday not a sunday because porygon days throwing a wrench throwing a 404 into things um that's pretty good was it it was like 404 is not found yeah because i think you want a 403 oh maybe will is here uh we got to speed run this because as i mentioned my cat is at the veterinarian the veterinarian closes at 6 p.m uh i do want do not want to pay pay have to pay for the cat to stay there overnight thank you all right all right well uh greg also here hello i am also here as you have just heard how's your cat non-existent my dog my dogs are good i mean that's your choice it's a good choice although i told you that i changed my office my work office so i'm trying to get the dogs used to that there's a room up here they can come visit me in and it has been a week of chaos now you have a podcasting office and a work office yes how luxurious wow i wish i had two offices i know look what's it like to be rich mr speaker so yeah don't come to minnesota number one oh excuse me this has been the greatest moment of your life no so before after the fantasy i know the last six months living in my high tower alone have been fantastic there's like this tiny room that they quote unquote called a bedroom which it like nobody can sleep in there uh and it was brent's home office for a while and then he moved downstairs and then when this whole situation became more permanent than i wanted it to be i took over that room so i could have a place for my computer offices well i mean if you count the living room and office for brent because he sits in the living room and does his work down there sure i feel every day i learn more about your husband i've learned more about his palace we have we bought a four bedroom house it was way too big for us dang we got some pokemon news uh i don't think anything breaking is going to happen on saturday or sunday before this normally we record but there was news this morning there was new raid stuff oh yeah i guess we'll talk about it but by the time this podcast comes up goes up on monday it'll be over so might as well talk about it still but yeah we have some pretty basic pokemon news for the week and then we'll get out of here and hopefully you guys are well i was gonna say you could listen to this for porygon day but that also happens on sunday the podcast comes out on monday that doesn't really work no i said this at the end of last week's episode i'll say it at the beginning of this

at brunch and to do community day together i just had a wonderful time and i wish we could see each other more often i do too such a lovely day for a porygon day lived in the same city listen steve there's a reason why i was just nice to greg period speaking of your city will we'll get into some pokemon news here this is uh off pokemon center.com also brandon from our slack community sent this in this is for you will they heard they listened bear walker premium skateboards series 2 are coming all right let me know when you're ready for my problem with this particular situation go describe the whole deal go go through the spiel all right all right bear walker is a master craftsman of carved wood skateboards partnering with pokemon center to create a second series of five limited edition 29 inch skateboards uh each skateboard design features one of the world's most popular poke i you know i'm not a fully agreeing with that sentence of the most popular pokemon but maybe that's there's some truth to that that's really all we know we don't know how many uh boards like there are five boards they're not saying there are only one of each board there's some pictures here and it looks like there's yeah the pictures had stacks of boards yeah it looks like shells it looks like there's plenty yeah they did sell out so this is series two series one sold out sold out in less than a day i think uh and you haven't been able to get them since and i want to say they were close to like 180 200 uh aboard most likely all you will okay issue there's a major issue that applies to everyone and a minor issue that applies to will anderson major issue unlike most skateboards you will find out in the world the art the carved pokemon and the the art is lovely beautiful the the rayquaza i think every single person who's looked at it has said wow that's fantastic toxicity debatable world's most popular pokemon either way the art is on the side of the skateboard for the uninformed i will say where you put your feet for your normal skateboarders i will say where you would cover it with grip tape you can't use these skateboards to actually skateboard no matter what they put in the pictures advertising for these skateboards i fundamentally i do not like skateboards that are produced as art pieces and not to be used as actual skateboards even if i am spending 200 for the board so that's that's the one issue the the will anderson issue is i have recently decided to improve as a self-improvement world improvement thing number one meatless mondays i'm trying not to eat any meat on mondays at all how does that apply to skateboards not at all but going hand in hand with that i'm doing no spend tuesdays i don't spend any money on tuesdays and these boards are coming out on a tuesday i mean so what happens on wasted all wednesday there you go if they're still in stock i'll be buying a toxicity skateboard but man the timing of this was just designed to make me unhappy so i i have a a couple things number one it is really weird uh to see umbreon and not espeon i can't why people like umbreon nobody likes nobody likes espeon i can't there's there's not i mean maybe if we go back 18 years or however long um umbreon and espn have been out 19 years they're always together so for umbreon to get aboard and espeon not to get aboard seems a little weird uh spoiler alert for series three maybe yeah remember what was in series one it was gengar charizard pikachu mewtwo and there was another one espeon um there's a toxicity here uh there's a rayquaza there's uh espeon there's mew and then because we they needed the most radical extreme pokemon ever togepi that togepi board is cute yeah it is cute there's nothing on the underside of these boards though well mike's a great exactly right the art is supposed to go on the wheel side and then it's supposed to be relatively plain on the feet side because you're going to cover it with grip tape well i mean there is grip tape on it if you like the well toxicity has little to note if you want the board with the most grip tape you're probably going to go with mu right because though that has if you look closely at it it is like the um dotted i don't know this this art is a ba relief there is that is not grip tape that is texturing sure but that's not made out of that sandpapery stuff that's going to grind the bottom of your shoes off that i need for grip tape oh gyarados scared us yeah gyarados i totally also agree with will these are like art pieces but why why are we putting wheels on and trucks on them just just sell me the board like i have purchased boards for our to hang on to you you are the worst kind of person you are promoting this lifestyle but i but when you buy a board for art you don't need the hardware you just need the board true and the hardware here trucks wheels bearings that's like 80 dollars right there well they don't come with that stuff you you only get the deck right no you get that you get out you get it all you get what is you get the wheels the the the truck you get it all you get it assembled i mean oh it's a different okay all of these people in dress pants seem to be skateboarding just fine in these pictures they look like they're going to work a thing that doesn't happen anymore in their khakis and very clean shots well little secret for you greg which is something i've recently discovered myself is that the actual traditional skateboarding pant is dickies like dickies uh trousers not jeans trousers well i don't know what the word is for i don't want to call them chinos i don't think they're chinos they're definitely not chinos it's dicky slacks yeah they're slacks slacks so that's why they look like that yeah they're just not regular old pants vicky's pants i mean i got them now too because i'm a skateboarder just getting from the website either way i'm excited disappointed saddened by my choice to not spend money on tuesdays all of it these boards are beautiful they go against a lot of my philosophies when it comes to buying skateboards because i feel that people who buy skateboards as art make the boards themselves more expensive girl skateboards at the at the same time that this was announced girls not like what do you think i was saying well people who don't know skateboards might think like why are you doing that you say skateboards for women i said girl skateboards it's a brand of skateboard right my girl is the name of a brand you want to get something for will anderson for christmas if you buy him something from girl skateboards you'll get to put a smile on his face because girl skateboards is my skate company either way i'm currently writing an andrew brophy pop secret girl skateboard they at the same time this announcement about the bear walker pokemon center collaboration literally within minutes announced that they're they're releasing a set of sanrio decks yeah that hurts which are awesome stuff it was also a tuesday i could not get walker the batsmaroo girl skateboard i want it so bad wait what is that real it's sold out already dude it's a girl skateboard sellout like on the same day they they have a they have a karopi they have batsmaroo they have hello kitty they don't have gudetama if they had had gudetama i would have broken my uh is the best isn't it awesome oh man i don't skateboard and i have no desire to but oh you could stick it on your wall like an artist sbj jacking up the prices of skateboards let's talk about some more merchandise here this is off silicon era new pokemon center merchandise featuring popular trainers from sword and shield this is so far only in japan although i i actually assume that this will eventually come to the united states this new set will a feature acrylic standees from rahan nessa piers marnie and leon lineup includes keychains towels okay i don't the towels are not coming to the united states it's dock covers iphone cases backpacks sweater special themed towel again i don't you know out of everything i just named don't think the towels are coming and plush dolls pre-orders for these will begin september 24th merchandise will launch september 26 specifically for the japanese pokemon center and then other characters in this lineup have include vulchner erica n serena may emmett and ingo you don't know who emmett and ingo is i bet will does battle subway e for black and white i know who they are well you don't express week after week that black and white is your favorite games no because uh hoenn games are his favorite games yeah so when there's a hoe and thing i set greg up for success here oh there you go you have never set any of us up for success i just set willa for success there's also um a ray han sweater a kabu towel a marnie backpack [Applause] when you say sweater do you mean hoodie or do you mean sweater that's actually something knit because that's something that drives me up the wall around this part of the car i'm reading from silicona it looks to me as a pull over is what i would call it with a hood no zip so but it's made out of sweatshirt material uh sure i would call that a hoodie why do people in this part of the country call those sweaters they're not sweat sweaters are knit from yarn period who who calls a hoodie a sweater plenty of people i know around here i would call i would say hoodie needs a zipper no you're incorrect a hoodie is a sweatshirt material top that has a hood on it zip or no zip correct i don't like i don't like the no zip i need the zip that's your personal preference that doesn't change the nature of the item is the ryan hoodie legit if there's one thing besides girl skateboards that will anderson loves it's hoodies i got a closet with like literally 20 hoodies i got a hoodie for every day of the month i have just realized that i have more hoodies than i have pairs of underwear what how how what oh it is legit it's pretty good yeah the ryan is pretty good oh it's the dragon yeah nah pass 2k mickey no it is gimmicky it is it's very gimmicky it's it's it's a lot i don't hate it though i like the t-shirts it's a hoodie you would buy at hot topic in the moment mm-hmm you know where like once they were twice and then you'd be like um it's not really comfortable it kind of stands out that's like the hoodie i bought at pokemon worlds and i wore it once and i was like this is actually really ugly which hoodie did you get at worlds the one with all the it's like beige and it's like everybody's like running around looking at fossils it's not a solid color and it's not black yeah and i also think i should have gotten it as an extra large not a large but whatever choices were made poor choices someone will receive that hoodie as a donation someday all right this is off pokemon.com september 16th yeah okay so i had to double check the date uh it was recently this week el cremie v-max dreadnought v-max galerion cursula v and more in pokemon tcg champions path champions path will uh arrive officially september 25th i am more than positive that walmart and target does not care and if they have them in stock they're putting them on shelves so it is possible you could find them early i do expect that this set will be relatively harder to find than other sets so you have and you cannot get this set in pure booster bat pop you cannot get the set in pure booster packs or a booster box you can only get them in like blister packs or um pin collections uh or something or elite trainer boxes so we have a cursor levy we have valcremi v we have el chromie v-max dreadnough v-max whale lord v uh these are all cards that have been in past japanese sets that have already arrived this is a limited set like hidden fates or like um dragons exalted or like shining legends so there will only be about 70 cards in this set to complete and there is from my understanding a shiny charizard in the set as well as the rainbow rare charizard v-max in the set if you want your sets to sell well look they didn't need the charizards for these to sell i don't think but now there's two charizards so i don't know i don't know what the value will end up being for either of these yet because obviously the they're not out yet but they come out soon and it's not a complete release on september 25th i think elite trainer boxes and i think some of the pin collections come out the 25th and then there are a different pin collections that come out in like november um so it's not it's it's not like if you miss out here you won't have an opportunity in the future should be opportunity in future uh we talked about this last week we'll talk about it again here players cup two registration is still open until about thursday afternoon so if you're doing if you if you're doing your raids if you're doing your dailies you're thinking about participating you gotta sign up in where it says sign up under versus under participate in ongoing events you do one match you get 50 battle points uh you have to complete the match uh you could bring squavit rickety wulu lose your match get your 50 battle points when when it's done if you want wait no pokeball t-shirt no no no t-shirt for player's cup 50 battle points that's at least one mint i think yeah you can find those for free now only well if you don't have the expansion you can't there's no mint island in bay bay sword and shield [Laughter] how's your bitterness level for what series five yeah still very high so they haven't made it so that i can practice in game yet nope they haven't responded to my demands nope or lack thereof yeah nope they are still running with series 5 all together i i i heard this from some other people i think the intention was it to be series six as there was in pokemon home said series six and elsewhere said series six and other places then said series five and then they had to tweet saying we apologize for the confusion it's series five but the thing i heard somebody selected the wrong rules because anyone can make a tournament right you can go in people do this all the time like r slash stun fisk or r vgc or people's discords or um youtubers or streamers have made tournaments you can make a tournament and you can set the rules right you can set singles you can set doubles you can set six pokemon four pokemon three pokemon what i'm assuming is whoever at the pokemon company needed to make this tournament didn't download the series six rules and they just started the tournament series five and they probably maybe didn't want to cancel it because then people who signed up there's so the the issue is there's no way to notify people that hey we messed up you need to re-sign up after people have signed up like you can't push a notification in-game and you can't just assume that all your players use twitter check no one checks pokemon.com and you can't assume everyone uses twitter or people use check their emails or stuff so i guess it would be unfair to however many people signed up before they realized oh this should be series six we can't cancel because how are we going to tell these people that we rejected their entry and they have to re-enter again that seems really weak like their in-game news there's email there's messages like yeah i agree they could do it that that just seems like not it's not that hard they have people who like are like double checking before you hit enter or like before it's published and made production to say all right did we do is does all this check off with what we expected and if you went in and you were rejected like there's a million ways to do that like they if if it was unintentional they could fix it right they could fix it and there's no way to say that they would have no way to reach all of them i mean they could definitely send out and do their best efforts to catch most of them yeah but so like how many people are not gonna be able to play at that point like we're not talking like it's the end of the world it's getting 50 battle point it seems that if it was truly a mistake they could go through lengths of fixing it and not have it be that hard um instead of forcing like everybody to be super dissatisfied with the outcome they're not good at communication you're not wrong i mean if i if i was in charge i would say cancel it let's do our best efforts to let people know if they sign up they have to re-sign up through twitter through email through the website yeah i mean that they they notified people that the tournament was happening those same people are going to be paying attention to the same channels but i i don't know what is it like one two three ten people probably in charge of this tournament and i'm assuming one of them says ah it's probably not that big of a deal without realizing like you you also you might think it's not that big of a deal but also we have no way to par we have no way to practice for this without using showdown which they will never acknowledge or want to talk about and even when you go to showdown even when you go to show here's the other problem that we didn't bring up last week even if you go to showdown you're not guaranteed to play against series five teams there's nowhere on showdown that does that like i think there are two there are two ladders and one is like vgc 20 and then the other is like battle spot doubles and i think smogon when this happened said you if you want to practice for series 5 go to vgc 2020 channel and if you want to practice if you want to do practice for series 6 go to battle spot doubles and that's fine but nothing is stopping somebody from go using a series 6 team in a s in when you're trying to practice for series five and i would argue and probably a lot of competitive people would argue that series six teams not they're not not as good but series five teams are better i guess or more competitive than a series six team that's why they were bad right like they took the top pokemon and they banned them and so if i'm playing a team that didn't include the top pokemon i feel like i'm at an advantage and i feel like like me beating the team sure is probably fine but also like i don't need to know how to beat primarina or volcarona like i need to know how to beat togekiss dragopal uh torkel rillaboom so like it almost feels like that battle is kind of a waste of time because it's not what i need to practice against like will suggested last week you practice against friends yeah you can but if they're not if if dragopalt is giving you trouble and you go to showdown and no one's using draggapult because they're like i'm using my series 6 team like that doesn't really help in what you need practice on it's it's dumb choices were made they were all poor yeah i feel like no one really wins well there will be a winner yep it's just in the game that they didn't want to play well let's take a break when we come back we have a little bit more news pokemon of the week uh question of the week and uh we will be right back actually waiting right now as well but it's one of those ones with the zip do you call them who do you call them a city zigzag [Music] oh they also used the wrong word for sweater too have you all heard of the term zippy [Music] we are back from our break sorry will not a lot of time to knit this week my masters news is very light well this week news alert for the crochet along that we're all doing this week was gage swatch week uh you only had to do five rounds everybody in the group that i'm working with has completed their gauge swatch except for maddie maddie on the move has not received her yarn yet so she gets an exception uh so there's not much to do anyways go ahead all right well uh lily and clefairy have been added to spotlight uh guzma and berg have been added to spotlight sabrina and caitlin have been added to spotlight uh gladion is now in spotlight lusamine is still in spotlight uh you can get cigna suit red also still in spotlight hey signified leaf is still in spotlight and sigma suit blue is also in spotlight if you want to give dna your money oh boy have they provided you options the only other masters news is which one is it as off yeah aself as elf aself aself as elf is the legendary battle arena boss i would actually argue that it's pronounced as elf yeah get the thing you and us i'm looking for it i'm looking for it it's usually on my desk i don't see it right now where else would it be you're such a neat freak dude yeah i know but i was i was i was taking instagram pictures and i had a clear oh my it's dead i gotta charge it we'll come back we'll circle back this is the worst you are completely unprepared i was unprepared for how to say as elf's name as we're waiting for that to charge uh move on move on to our next mobile game here did you finish the family storyline i have not started the family storyline yet what i have till the end of the month what i you you wasted your time watching the anime yeah look i i was i was eating b-dubs buffalo wild wings irene irene was like we should watch something and i said well i want to watch can we watch pokemon journeys and she said oh yeah cool let's do that i didn't know what else i wanted to watch so i put up the sun and moon anime as i waited because i couldn't start an episode of journeys without her which is where i learned that uh spoiler for the sun and moon anime from four years ago that lusa means clefable was actually lily's original clefairy and lily was upset that lusamine evolved her clefable without her permission well but how did she get her hands on it you don't just you're like walk away from your pokemon and somebody else snatches it team rocket isn't that all what the last 20 years of pokemon is i mean it's just more bad mom behavior right yeah yeah they do a really well i mean i've only seen like one or two episodes with lucimine but her voice actor is really good and they um they do like a really good job of making her a bad mom but like shh like she's oblivious to it yeah i mean the anime she's a very watered down bad mom like there's a lot of people who rightly so say that the anime was designed to try to redeem lusamine's character because she's definitely not she's definitely portrayed more as i'm an overworked mom and i'm really doing all these things and it's just i'm oblivious to it instead of the games which is like no she's malicious yeah yeah yeah yeah so a lot of people are get upset that the anime really goes out of its way to try to redeem that character for marketing reasons and i think i i get it but yes she's still a bad mom but not the terrible mom she is in the gates it's also different universes so come on folks you can tell different stories in different places yep trust me disney's the little mermaid has minimal reflection of the original hands christian anderson correct imagine multiple spiderman are in one movie that was a good movie man it was so good i need to watch that again i'll come over okay porygon day has come and gone probably already did it uh it was from september 20th to 11 to 5. oregon now greg and i had a great time we had a great got 15 shiny porygons out of my ears get the exclusive move try attack uh there will be a commit there was a community today uh exclusive porygon themed special research or a dollar i don't look if i'm gonna play for more than i would say if i played for more than an hour i feel like the dollar is worth it in my opinion it's only a dollar you're playing i don't know what if you're playing all six one of your entire meals at mcdonald's though like you are saying it's true i am giving up a meal at mcdonald's for a porygon day i mean maybe i'm like super jaded still from like well i'm always jaded i feel like i'm jaded when it comes to the the the free to play pokemon go players that like need to let you know at all costs that they're free to play and they play all three to six hours of a commune day they can't spend that dollar they're free to play you know well how could they if if they pay it's not free anymore is it your time is worth something great wow our time is worth it we're also not free to play players why am i why am i paying them to eat up my time because you're having fun am i because games are fun okay ah all games are fun all games are fun that's not true [Laughter] speaking of fun oh sorry uh mega pidgeot wait that was maybe that transition was playing did we did we hit the goal are we getting mega pidgeot good we hit the goal mega pidgeot as of this as a friday as of an hour ago will and greg uh mega pidgeot is available in raids you should be able to find it it's there yeah another mega pokemon that you can get okay moving on uh this is offpokemon.com this was the breaking news this morning celebrate the seasonal equinox in pokemon sword and pokemon shield with pokemon that evolved with the moonstone and the sunstone i'm not what's an equinox this is a dumb question it is the time of the year when both day and night are of equal length got it i thought it was when the sun the moon goes in front of the sun that is an equivalent that's an eclipse oh okay does that happen actually a lunar solar solar eclipse yeah september's seasonal equinox is up almost upon us trainers this day the day that grants us with oh it says here in the if you think i would read these articles ahead of you i think the day that grants i looked at this article for like three hours this morning making a graphic for it that is true that is true this day that grants us equal parts daylight and darkness is being commemorated in sword and shield with a max raid battle event from thursday september 17th to sunday september 20th you will encounter raids that feature the evolved featuring pokemon that will evolve either using a moonstone or a sunstone during this event be on the lookout for moonstone pokemon like clefable wigglytuff and and sun stone pokemon like blossom whimsicott and liligant and if you're extremely lucky trainers extremely not lucky extremely lucky be clear you might even encounter a shiny clefable fourth month in a row they've done like a weekend raid event yeah is it what was last month last month was pikachu for people right right right right right and then the month before that was whale lord correct oh no this is the third one and then way back in the day they did the magikarp yeah magikarp so this is the fourth one but third in a row and technically the equinox is on the 22nd my still minor complaint is i feel like it just should be one day longer some people might not be able to get to play until sunday night and it ends 5 00 p.m pacific on sunday nights i don't see why going into monday is such a bad thing uh because if people really cared they would put their effort towards the things that are important okay i have to cut it off so that kids can do their homework before school on monday look pokemon company i can't drop everything one not even a full they announced this this morning they didn't even give us a heads up they never give us a heads up on this no they just drop it and go hope you're free this weekend this is a lesson to everybody that sometimes you need to let things go or it's also a lesson on time management if you really want it you'll make time the only thing that bugs me is they keep doing it over community day weekend yep they keep that that's kind of it i'm surprised the players cup two is next week and not this week because they would do that too they'd be like players cup this week and community day and i'm waiting i mean the venn diagram of everybody who wants to do those things is not a circle necessarily if it is i'm like one of the few that are in it well you're in the meaty parts that's true it's a cool uh it's a cool event um cerebe is reporting that it is the same as waylord which is a 1 in 50 chance a 2 so not as generous as pikachu which was i think 8 and i believe magikarp was also 8 although uh people did complain that waylord and pikachu were a little harder to catch i think they were species catch rate um uh and it's magi i'm sure magikarp was actually species catch rate as well except magikarp is like pretty hard not to catch yeah it's super easy to get to magikarp um so uh sarah b did say that it seems that if you are the host of clefable you are a guaranteed catch and if you are the guest of somebody you have a very high increase but not guaranteed which was uh very different than the whale lord also just because we're talking about max raids there was a really good reddit post i want to say i can't remember if it was on our slash pokemon sword and shield or slash pokemon sword shield with no and um and i don't have it in front of me right now but they did i think 170 raids and tested with the dusk ball their data showed that a raid is not considered a cave and so the dust ball was not getting increased odds and what is what's that word where people believe something just because urban legend uh like specious reasoning is that is that what it is sure that sounds like a nice thing because so many people play in the evening the dust ball is boosted when you play in the evening right because it works in caves or it works when it's after like 6 p.m 6 p.m 7 p.m whenever the like and rock thing is over 7 p.m because i think lake and rock thing is yeah six to seven six isn't it five to six five to six yeah so six pm would be night yeah so they their data and i can't really find this anywhere it's just a bunch of data that is that they they did on reddit says that the max raid dens are not considered a cave but a dust ball would be effective if you're in a mass max raid den at night but also just use a repeat ball because it'll ring people or just use a ball that you want because it's just data exactly take that with a grain of salt i didn't do the research i read it though seemed very thorough they did a lot more raids than uh than i would have probably done to try to track down that stuff so that stuff always is always is always cool to see just like people are that are like ah i'm just gonna calculate this maths it's just for calculating how you can catch pokemon it has no other for all kids who said i when they were in school and you're like i have no use for this mathematics you're wasting my time well haven't you been proven wrong you too can see how easy it is to catch the pokemon other bit of news here is off nintendo wire new articles like a week old but new cafe mix i figured i just i was like we should probably talk about cafe mix are getting more events um so the current event going on right now that actually ends i believe on monday uh is the torterra event the what torterra you know the the the pokemon with a tree on its back yeah but that that's too big to fit in that little cafe what it could be on the outside part maybe the cafe is on the torterra oh it's turtles all the way down yeah exactly yes okay got it yeah sure steve has no idea what that is a reference to oh that's perfectly fine [Music] last article here i'm already annoyed by the writer of this article off nintendo life i did post this on our subreddit because i originally found it on reddit and then i shared it to our subreddit r super effective is there an instruction manual for using reddit because all the kids are on there these days i can't figure that thing out step one is you have to love wasting time uh step two is you have to uh be able to see really dumb things get upvoted and then yep uh just accept that they're just these people love being wrong and number three is uh you ever have to not read the comments but that's what i mean that's that's not my so my issue with reddit is it's like i open the reddit app and i'm like i want to see what's the one that's on my phone yep okay and i'm like i want to see what's going on with it's super r slash it's super effective no just super effective no it's well that may be half my problem but it's like i'm like i i search and i look and i'm like i know it exists please take me there you gotta you gotta subscribe to the subreddit right i think i did and then you guys then when you go to the reddit app then you have your like news and then you have your home and then you have your popular the new the home is like your twitter feed it shows you all the posts aggregated from the subreddits you're subscribed to no it shows me a bunch of posts from things i never subscribed to right r science i have no interest in that no then then you're under the news then you're under the no i am on home i understand how an underline works on an iphone screen sir oh oh okay so when you sign up for reddit it auto-subscribes you to a bunch of really bad subreddits like r games which is possibly no that's impossible nothing is worse than our slash pokemon but i would say our slash games or video is it our slash video games or slash games is is probably second worse let me give you the good ones r slash uh hold my juice box that one's good r crappy design also good um r slash well that sucks pretty good r slash what could go wrong also very good but sometimes could be bad because sometimes what could go wrong is somebody getting very seriously injured and i don't want to see that so you just gotta be a little careful with that one r slash gadgets is pretty good our slash legal advice very bad but still fun to read how do i get our slash super effective you go to the search and then you just type in us but i subscribed to it why isn't there just a button for me to say this is the one i subscribed to let me go to that one well you can favorite it you got to go to your communities then which is the like four squares yeah i see that and then there's actually two circles and two squares but sure yep yep and then oh there it is there it is why is there all these other things in there that i never asked for in the first place when you sign up they put they give it's like when you sign up for twitter they're like you want to follow bill gates and you're like i don't know sure but i didn't say yes to anything i don't i don't know look that's just what comes with reddit it's like when you sign up for myspace and you're already friends with tom you didn't ask you didn't ask to be friends with thompson yeah but he was a friendly i thought tom and i were friends i know are you telling me that's not a real relationship possibly not okay okay here's the other thing will when using reddit turn off your brain turn on your anger and go to town i choose not to follow a path of anger thank you well then get off reddit our subreddit's good i'm trying to get it more active well now that i know how to find it i'll go and post all kinds of wacky things look if you want easy karma you take whatever you take the latest youtube video or whatever posted the subreddit easy karma i don't need karma oh you gotta have karma no when the world collapses and all we have to trade on the black market for milk is either going to be shiny pokemon or karma you got to have one or the other karma and the new york times will give me the news of the day and that's about it i'm just holding on to my ancient mew card for when the dark time comes because that's going to be worth millions it's going to be next year bear walker youtube skateboard yep okay i just i'm going to read this article i disagree with and i'm gonna explain why it's gonna be very logical nintendo and creatures and game freak file for a trademark for the legendary pokemon entei i want everyone to stop i know what you're thinking right away i will explain what's about to happen i'm going to read the article though which is going to say what you all are thinking but it's wrong because this person did not do any research i don't know why i pulled this article at the start of the month nintendo creatures and game freak filed for an app trademark application for entei as the name of the legendary fire type pocket monster that appeared in first gold and silver on the game boy color according to poke jungle some fans think the trademark could be a follow-up to the 2018 switch release let's go pikachu let's go eevee here are some speculations from a pokemon subreddit quote pokemon entei sounds a bit like a spin-off but it could have some connection to let's go end quote this is possibly the worst article we've ever read on this podcast wow of course we've read worse it could be anything related to pokemon just wait and see all right i'm not going to call out the author but i'm just disappointed with this article but here's the deal i'm gonna explain what's happening right now this is not this is nothing to do with let's go pikachu let's go eevee now let's start with step one we we know that the pokemon company puts two games out at once why would they just do entei exactly why why is there no ryko why is there no suicune okay so if we can get past that point mentally we go to the second point they've put pokemon on the covers of games before xerneas evil tall suicune venusaur groudon kyogre none of these pokemon have been trademarked in that way okay so again we're moving away from the let's go stuff number three let's talk about pokemon that have been trademarked not a huge list of them but specifically we can look at something if you've listened to the show for a long time you probably know what i'm about to say uh they have to trademark things that that exist in a world where people physically interact with them so this is what coined the term ultra shiny the reason ultra shiny was trademarked is because it was the name of a japanese trading card game set that released in japan it came to the united states they changed the name to hidden fates which was trademarked there have been terms in the pokemon world that have never been trademarked in in the way we're sp in in this form of trademark so that would be like cantonian gallerian alolan shiny has never been trademarked in this way uh mega evolution or mega pokemon not trademarked in that way but there have been pokemon themselves that have been trademarked in a specific way so this would be like meowth this would be the starter pokemon lapras rayquaza um and alolan vulpix have all been trademarked in this way that way would be the all those pokemon i named are mascots of pokemon centers so out of every single alolan pokemon shown only alolan vulpix was trademarked and only out of all those alolan pokemon alolan vulpix is a mascot of the sapar sapporo i believe pokemon center um rayquaza mascot of skytree lapras mascot of the pokemon center that opened in taiwan so in that sense those pokemon have been trademarked so my guess would either be my guess is that entei is going to be a mascot of a pokemon center in japan that is probably near a volcano is actually probably my guess because it is the volcano pokemon um and there would be no reason to trademark a pokemon for a toy or for a game because they've never had to do that before there's a bunch of alolan vulpix merchandise that exists and cards and it's in the anime a lot but the reason they had to trademark it was because it was a mask out of a pokemon center so uh i there's your three parts your we haven't needed a trademark pokemon why are suicune and entei not trademarked point number two we've never had to trademark pokemon that have appeared on the cover of games and then point number three here are the list of pokemon that have been trademarked and they've been related to physical real world products like a pokemon center that you would visit that's all reasonable and it makes sense i'm actually shocked i'm so excited for let's go entei though i really can't wait for monday's announcement i can't i mean it's going to be in the mini showcase of other developers and they're going to sneak it in in the end because because game freak is a is another developer and then it's going to be um diamond in pro remakes confirmed because entei is going to be a new mascot in um ultra platinum shiny uh the only other thing i thought which might be a stretch because again i don't think pokemon needed to be trademarked to be in featured in movies but they did redo the first pokemon movie they did redo the second pokemon movie technically technically on both of those well the first one's not technically they definitely redid the first pokemon movie the second one they just stole the name and put lukie on it for five seconds [Laughter] oh that movie's so bad entei is while it is a fake entei in the third movie it's just an illusion created by the unknown it is in the third movie that would be maybe my other guess they want to do that maybe oddly enough the pokemon now that i'm thinking about that oddly enough the pokemon center also released a bunch of unknown merchandises [Applause] now the pieces are coming together but i don't think you i don't think you need a trademark for movie though because if they did oh we don't know law except for greg's lawyers yeah my doctorate mastery of lawyering that i have but i don't deal i don't deal in movie layering i only deal with podcast lawyering so question of the week question question gotta ask the question everybody's looking for the question of the week this is from franco from our slack community if a po if the pokemon company came knocking what job would each of you want to do there the ceo look they're coming to knocking they're asking me what job i want to be ceo i want to drive i'm going to drive this ship and correct the course i'm going to fix the trees i'm going to cut pokemon left and right we're going to ditch that normal type sorry steven we're going to make so many quality of life improvements we're going to add more rocks because it's going to annoy steve all of it i have a bold vision and then we're gonna start the massive pokemon mmo project and then i will be fired in 2023 but that's fine because i made my mark on the world i would like to work in um story and basically production that way of actually contributing to the actual cohesiveness of an actual good pokemon story just you know i don't have big dreams i'll be happy to work in the background this probably sounds dumb i would want to be the dude that is in charge of making sure every all like all the pieces fit together of like this is how we say the pokemon's name this is this is the pokemons like lore this is how it's connected this is legendary this is mythical this is ultra beast this is baby this is starters why so you want to you want to write the continuity manual yeah continuity like why did they say the red gyarados and the one episode and then like four episodes later they say shiny which happened recently i don't want to spoil it for anyone for the netflix stuff but greg knows what i'm talking about oh yes i mean i kind of get why they said red yeah i mean it was red colored but i um the whole i texted you about this it's spoiled territory all right can we put a spoiler warning for for the first like spoiler spoiler this this spoiler warning for the first 15 episodes of pokemon journeys on netflix all right so in episode 12 you 13 13 no it's 12 and 13 technically because they leave it they leave a cliffhanger right okay because they leave the cliffhanger yeah so 12 and so 12 to 13 is the dreadnaught cliffhanger right yeah and then the introduction of the one character is in 14 right right yep yeah okay so in episode 12 ash and go get tickets to see the world championship yep and that is between lance the dragon type trainer from the uh why am i why am i explaining who lance is everybody knows who lance is the dragon guy that doesn't have enough dragon types correct next against leon side note lance's voice actor i wasn't impressed with leon's voice actor very good yeah are we agree with that okay and so it ended up being charizard obviously from leon vs gyarados which yeah when at first i was like why is this not dragonite and then i was like well that's nice because the reason lance has gyarados is because of like lance appears in the like a rage and helps save the gyarados and like gets rid of all the like it's a really nice nod to you know the con the continuity i don't know the continuation from red and blue to gold and silver and it's a shiny gyarados it's the red one again like a rage and it sparkles kind of like the x and y sparkles when it comes out ash is it either ash or gogo wow a red gyarados yeah i think it's go i guess technically in so in diamond on pearl no i know there's we're not talking about remakes here i know people are like diamond pearls [Music] if you remember the beginning of the game if you went to like the tv i think bef before you like went on your adventure it would say or was it the tv or is the radio one of the two would be like we we heard reports or whatever from like a red gear it specifically says red gyarados yeah it does um and it's like really subtle and if you're not paying attention or you haven't played the beginning of diamond pearl in the last like 15 years you probably don't remember that part because it's so insignificant so that's my only maybe reason why they decided to say red gyarados also gen 4 remakes confirmed yeah but it's going to be called let's go entei right but be placed in gen 4. yep they're they're breaking all the patterns yeah so greg texted me and said have they ever said the word shiny in an anime episode out loud and i cannot remember i couldn't think of one even when not even when knock towel was shiny that entire season they said special they said special or clever little knocktowel um and then i remember lily has shiny spoilers for older episodes of anime lily has a shiny magirna which no one really knew what was shiny until the pokemon home files got released because mcgiron technically didn't have a shiny that we knew of but so everyone was like oh her mcgearn is just a weird color which is not weird for the anime because remember like the pink butterfree from the first season that wasn't shiny so that wasn't inherently weird but they didn't acknowledge it was shiny and then i remember the um what's his name like horror horricopus or whatever the he's like the evil i have no idea he's the evil dude who who appears at the end of the season 20 anime and uh sophocles aesthetic i can't remember his name right now sophie cleveland races his charger bug against him but his charger bug his charge bug is shiny but they never acknowledge it they don't even like acknowledge that he's holding like a pokemon they're just like he just has i'm looking up his name horus horacio horatio horatio is that a real name yes horatio hornblower which will forever not be orca there's not even a c in that he has a shiny charge bug they never say it at least unless he comes back later i explained to you why they never point out that yeah i think this is a one-and-done so okay so in episode 14 it's yeah it's the episode where they go to unova they say it really fast and really aggressive yeah unova you know they're in the unova region and uh ash and golf save oh gosh what is that dude's name his name is like jimmy or something they saved they saved this dude from a cafe regis yes and they say it correctly in the anime people yes coffee grigas who's saying coffee great is wrong at this point oh there is a certain complete pokedex rap that a certain popular internet person did and they say it completely wrong ruining the entire thing i don't know what that is anyways fine there's two there's two coffee grigas and the little the boy pops out and then a blue psyduck pops out a shiny psyduck and i think it's go goes wow a blue psyduck yeah and then uh the boy maybe maybe the maybe just i i can't imagine that go like they know what when he explains what a shiny is he goes oh this is the first my first pokemon i'm pretty sure his exact words are my first pokemon was a shiny pokemon yeah well because they at the quiz him why he because he says he's only going to fill out his pokedex by collecting shiny and he says and he has like he has like 10 pokemon yeah he says when you're first when the first pokemon you encountered was a shiny pokemon it's a sign that you should follow that path or something and that's when i texted steve i'm like what what what they actually said these words do you think there's people out there who like when starters aren't shiny locked their first one that they pick is shiny and they don't even realize it oh maybe 100 yeah well they sell they saw how many like 15 million games one in 8 000 chance at least prior to gen 6 there are tons of people that probably have shinies that have no clue what they are all right i'm pulling up i'm pulling up the episode here his name is there's like a there's like four new characters in this episode yeah there's a lot of characters there's right girl with the meditate there's the there's the dude with the sparkly eyes who's awesome and they don't give him enough time shane his name is shane shane shane seeker his last name is seeker uh okay so um according to bulbapedia here this episode is marks the first appearance of a number of species with long abs absences uh meditate was uh 565 episodes ago cough agrigus was 378 episodes ago yeah mass 300 episodes slack wait there's a slack off in this episode oh cause he's in the pokedex yeah 298 episodes ago woo bat also can we hold on ash got really excited to catch the woof head i know out of all the pokemon so far this up and this is in the series like the first one where he's like very excited for is like oh a woo bat this one's mine what are you doing man uh this episode features the most shiny pokemon in an anime a total of five four of them only appear through images yeah so it doesn't say anything about this is the first time they use the term shiny so if if you know if that you can think of an episode please let us know i can't think of a time in the anime that they specifically said shiny and referred to multiple shinies they've always called them oh that's a blue or that's a red yeah i can't think of until this time but now you know shiny confirmed like official anime i mean i guess it's how people would talk though right like if you don't know what a shiny is and you're playing pokemon go and it sparkles and you're not informed you would probably be like oh i got i got a blue i got a pink whale yeah it's normally blue so i guess that makes sense but like once he started explaining shinies ash and go were like oh yeah we know what those are we know all about that but that like but then who in the world officially dubbed them shiny like there's a we need to explore the deep lore of who who who first named them in the world was it shane did shane go on uh pokemon world reddit and say i am called calling these shiny and did he get upvoted for it oh no [Laughter] is that the only thing that matters in this world is getting up votes yep yeah yeah yeah karma toads well i'm i must not exist in this world because i don't think i've ever gotten an upvote in my entire existence so i'll give you an upvote so shane has uh shiny onyx a shiny swine nub a shiny slack off and a shiny bag gun yep i think it's pretty good yeah he said he just started too yeah and he's like what maybe 12 so he's been running around in circles for a while and then i liked when they were doing the the battle against golurk they're like oh yeah we got a raid battle and he's like ah it's not shiny i'm not yeah yeah i'm out i'm out i don't care i'm out of this one uh it's pretty good also still spoiler territory is go lurk permanently stuck in that transformed was that what we learned at the end no i think he caught it he caught it but when they released it in the park it still didn't have legs oh i haven't gotten that far i don't know how did you not finish the episode oh wait the park oh yeah mean i thought he was just resting yeah he still doesn't have legs though hey look he's still in the non-like form i'm like he couldn't make his legs vanished you don't know what ghosts can and cannot do you don't make the ghost rules we need we need to consult hercopus yeah i'll get orca puss on the phone you can hark up us on the line and find out what what really is also they spell it they spell horatio wrong in the anime because they spell it with the c see i told you to see in there that's why i was trying to say it that way there's still no puss i don't remember i don't know where that part came from but i would i would like going back to the question i was like how did we get here how did we would you like to be in charge of continuity yes i would like to be in charge of continuity when i'm ceo i will put you in charge of continuity i i feel like i feel like at the pokemon company from the outside we probably this is this is how it is for every game right from the outside you're like oh they clearly had an obvious plan but on the inside on the inside it's chaos yeah i'm sure it's all chaos and somebody's on the phone being like how do we say this giant green dragon from the sky which is the right way raymond quasar uh i'm sure what you want to write is you want to write the official pokemon continuity bible the one that everybody has to consult right on anything pokemon related i want perfect these are all the babies these are all the ultra beasts i'm still in the camp that cosmog is not an ultra beast i know people think it is still in the camp i want to also state that one of the arguments used against me was well they say the the professor goes well that that looks like an ultra beast and literally in the same episode like 10 minutes later the the narrator goes we still don't know if cosmog is an ultra beast no one gave me that part of the episode they just gave me the part of the episode where she says i think it's an ultra beast uh i still don't think cosmog is an ultra beast i'm gonna die on that hill you just think it's what it's a legendary pokemon because that's why i was featured in the year of legendary so here here are my here here are my arguments okay okay so aether foundation believes it's the type of ultra beast because it can open ultra hormones yes and your thing is the ultra wormhole is just a weird power that this legendary has is that accurate yes okay i agree with steve because because cosmog evolves into luna or solgaleo which are the legendary pokemon of alola yeah if it was an ultra beast then it wouldn't be in their traditions when they did the year of legendary which was 2000 because the euro mythical was 2016. featured lunala solgaleo type null silvally cosmog cosmoem but no ultra beasts on that list so was there another legendary oh the tapus all the tapus were part of the euro just like your rayquaza your cresselia your articuno zapdos all the legendaries were featured no ultra beasts were featured necrozma was also featured on that list so that's point one on the officialpokemon.com they have no ultra beasts under the year legendary number two is every ultra beast has beast boost cosmo cosmo lunala solgaleo necrozma none of them no beast boos there's not an ultra beast that doesn't know beast boosts and there's an exception here i'll get to the exception's gonna get ya number three is that the beast ball does not increase or work on lunala or solgaleo when you catch it in ultrasound ultra moon after the game because you don't catch it pre in that game and it does not work on necro necrozma either we know that from both games that the beast ball doesn't work on these pokemon okay so number four is in the tcg an official pokemon product all of the ultra beasts in the game have a red gx text and all the non-ultra beasts have black gx text it's very subtle but there is not a single cosmog cosmoam lunala necrozma or so solgaleo card that has the red ultra bees text some of the cards just flat out say ultra beasts on them okay so this gets into the exception the only exception is when necrozma changes form to ultra necrosma that card specifically says ultra beast but there's not a single solgaleo or lunala card that says ultra beast unless okay it's ultra necrosma or unless alt or unless necrozma takes over solgaleo and lunala but that is still necrosma which is the just the general exception to the rule right because when it's dawn wings or dusk mane it is still necrosma in both the games and the tcg and all the stuff right so if anyone is the weird exception it's necrozma it's not sogalia lunala they just they're just the they just open the wormholes yeah so is the idea that alternate crosma becomes an ultra beast because it goes back to that dimension and it wasn't an ultra beast before then yes so necrozma is the absence of light so that's why that's why it comes in sun cache in in ultrasound ultra moon that's what it's looking for it's like going to absorb the sun and all the light in the alola region to get its pure its original form back right yeah but it's not an ultra beast until it goes well that's to the other dimension is that is that what we're saying no because in the in the in the ultra wormhole it also doesn't have its form right in both alola and in the wormholes it's it it's not an ultra form until what happens at the top of the tower when you climb who gives it energy i don't remember what happens i know you fight it but i don't remember how it gets all the energy i don't either here's the secret the real revelatory secret that you all have to know i think steve you have to close your ears because i don't think you can handle this oh yeah [Applause] it's all completely arbitrary and made up and none of it has to be could because you do not work for tpci yet not yet there is no continuity consistency you slap whatever labels you want on it tomorrow they'll change their minds and put a different label on it it's completely arbitrary there is no grand physics of the pokemon universe there's no grand taxonomy today i'm an ultra beast tomorrow i'm a mythical it's you're you're losing money by spending thought power thinking about these things this is all correct necrozma's not this weird exception though right maltan is a mythical pokemon that can evolve manafee is a mythical pokemon that can breed you know there wasn't legendary pokemon that could evolve and then you know we have type null probably something else right type null evolves uh something else evolves i mean cosmog evolves yeah cosbog yeah cosmog evolves so there's definitely exceptions there's all these exceptions it's fine but there ain't no one at least that i know of at the pokemon company trying to put all these together and keep it straight someday that will be your job yep pokemon of the week all right i i'm so disappointed i almost didn't want to give a new pokemon this week just because literally no one was able to guess or at least none of the people that normally write to me to give me their guesses of what the pokemon of the week is i didn't get none of that and i literally could not have made this any easier and i will say before i repeat the clue from last week the thing that i think i've said numerous times forgive me if i have never said this before but i think i have uh you have to listen to all of the words that i say because if you listen to all of the words then you'll get it and this is like and i will throw back to last week which i didn't mention for amara literally the first thing i said was i wanted to write 680 words eight 680 more words for this but here are 18. if you add 680 to 18 you get 698 which is the pokedex number for amora i could not have made that easier for you people anyways this week i thought that tomorrow one was easy i'm so angry this week's clue is one letter of all the pokemon unless i am grievously mistaken there is only one that can in any language let me repeat that part in any language be clearly identified by one letter all right gentlemen give me your guesses it's chat it's not cheddar i don't know this one's unknown to me well it's not unknown [Laughter] all right let me give you a little more uh a little more background um how many languages is pokemon available in 18 12. no it's like six dude we talking tcg or oh we're talking again pokemon is available in japanese french spanish german italian korean cantonese chinese mandarin chinese i guess hindi and thai that's new to me but of all those languages do they all use the latin alphabet the answer is no they don't use the latin alphabet in japanese or chinese or korean but when this particular pokemon's name is written using japanese writing korean writing chinese writing they always use the roman letter z no matter what language you look at porygon z there's always a z in its name and that would be the pokemon of the week and also it's dagnabbit pouring on community day this weekend but it's porygon corrupted too oh okay that's not a letter that's a corrupted two okay okay sure accepting pokemons not porygons [Music] yeah no there was no pokemon xyz no it's zygarde uh it is the first trivia of on bulbapedia porygon z is the only pokemon whose japanese name is spelled with a special character from a foreign alphabet there you go oregon z weighs exactly as much as dawn what it shares similarities with weave oil and alolan marowak these are the important facts that you need to know dubious disc applies implies that porygon z unlike its pre-evolution was not authorized by silphco in pokey park wii pikachu's adventure see this is why they need to hire me this right here this is it in pokey park wii's pikachu adventure porygon z is referred to as a he even though poory got it and porygon is genderless the these are the details i'm there for we gotta make sure they say they not he yes absolutely this is a genderless pokemon there is no heart on its tail there's no there's no heart on its butt not that we know you know maybe in the future in addition to in addition despite never appearing in the anime outside of a brief cameo it did receive an anime voice in an aforementioned game like every other are they talking wait what trip oh wait what this is a sub point to pokey park yeah yeah i don't know that's like the most bizarre trivial trivia ever so in poke in poker park do they say like do they say their name like they do in the anime i don't remember oh they probably i think they do so that's what they're saying is since it was never in the anime where it spoke it does say i'm assuming porygon z porygon z in the game yeah i think that's what that actually says porygon zed um it should be cor porygon 2 2. since no leveling up is required porygon or porygon 2 or porygon z can all be evolved twice at level 1. oregon z is tied with drampa and mega pidgeot look at that timing wheel for the highest base special attack of all normal type pokemon oregon and its pre-evolutions are the only pokemon where all three members can learn both hyper beam and giga impact i like poor gunzi a lot probably one of the better things that came out of gen 4. what's funny is that it's considered to be a corruption when it's actually got better art than the original porygon 2 i don't know oh well i guess maybe because it's like rayman and the parts have all kind of come apart yeah it's clearly broken its eyes are all messed up googly although the shuffle icon is really good it's it's tail is down its arms are up it's it's having some issues but it's got a sweet sweet shiny and how is its uh shuffle icon sweet it's really good you get get that real get that real googly eye let me also express uh additional disappointment in our slack community because one day last week they were literally talking about porygon in the general channel and i put in the statement boy you guys shouldn't this conversation be in pokemon of the week and then like five of them moved over to pokemon of the week and started questioning what could the pokemon of the week be and i was like did you not notice that you were all just talking about porygon wow pay attention you got to be quick around will anderson but not that quick i have high expectations dude i think the slack community was more focused when they were all actually at their jobs avoiding work exactly oh yeah for now that they're at home we feel like the work and they're looking for other distractions well let me give you this week's distraction uh obviously since porygon z was far too hard for everyone uh we're going extra simple this week shut up now we've already done chat out this year while last week's pokemon of the week could be identified by just one letter this week's psychic type pokemon is represented by every latter letter of the latin alphabet including some punctuation you will also note that the gallerian alphabet does not use transcriptions of these pokemon as this pokemon has not yet been found in galler while this pokemon is not particularly popular in the traditional pokemon cartridge games it is quite sought after in pokemon go it has only been released and in restricted quantities to correspond with special events i mean come on now no clue oh yeah mystery what a mystery this is
