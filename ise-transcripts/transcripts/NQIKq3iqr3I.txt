[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 412 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ with me Greg hello I have returned welcome you are back will and back also back happy pride um I have I have a few things to say okay yeah exactly is this gonna be short but Rob it's not it's like two two statements and a question okay my number one statement I have now officially purchased Bioshock for the fifth time what why because I started playing it on my xbox one and then I don't have my xbox one in my house anymore so I went on my ps4 and it had Bioshock for $12 so it's like bugs yeah every time I buy it it costs less sample by the fit by the 18th time they're just giving you money my second statement I just want to say thank you to everybody who has expressed support and concern for me and Greg over the past couple of weeks very greatly appreciate it and my third since this is a Pokemon podcast I have a question for Steve Steve do you know what it means to pull someone's leg from context clues from last week you don't okay I won't be completely transparent with you guys I can't even remember the last like 72 hours more or less more or less the last episode of this podcast because I think al said something and then you said well now you've pulled my leg and you like reveal some additional information I was like no Alden pull your leg at all no no I think it was like like what is it like when you like reveal someone seek like that you know if it was me I'd say you spilled my tea but that's that's like whatever when you pill somebody's leg it means you pull a prank on the yeah I know that not according to accessibility is the better version of straight people spreading gossip will they go oh well twist my arm like Oh make me tell you this yeah yeah we don't have we don't have that guilt let's fill the teeth I'm at the drop of a hat that's what that's what we live for in our genes career yeah I'm pretty good at getting my arm twisted yeah it doesn't take a lot yeah no I'm speaking of which have I got something to tell you oh boy oh boy oh boy well we got a we got a loaded show we there there was the release date for armor

the podcast who doesn't use slack or discord or twitch wanted to throw their name into that hat another expression yes that will that link will be Michelle welcome to expression cast expressions that you may know but Steve probably said wrong correct okay now with all of that out of the way the launch date unveiled for part one of the pokemon sword expansion pass and pokemon shield expansion pass this was on June 2nd today the Pokemon company International and Nintendo announced new details for the pokemon sword and Pokemon shield expansion past downloadable the pokemon sword and pokemon shield video games the first set of content the aisle of armor will launch on June 17th and the second crowned Tundra launches this fall 2020 the expansion patch is purchasable in the Nintendo eShop newly discovered Pokemon new Giganta max forums exclusive moves and more revealed three four minute trailer have this just about yeah about and it showed both the island of armor and Crown tundra okay well what we'll talk about that the isle of armor is the first new adventure unlocked by the expansion pass it will take place on the isle of armor an island of off the gala region many Pokemon make this island their home living freely admitted the lush nature the island is also home to a dojo for Pokemon battles players and their Pokemon will train hard to become stronger under mustard the master of this dojo we got one new Pokemon in this trailer we got DeLorean Slowbro yeah with this pinchy Megaman arm they that's what it is it is Megaman yeah they're a poison psychic pok√©mon which has never been done before right yes I believe this is our first I don't know we got to be careful when we say these things because somebody always finds that one bruh bomb be out there and then like wow before I can't believe I forgot that okay so a shelter by shelter bite set off a chemical reaction with the species inside glarey and slowpokes body causing gallery' and slow bro the gain the poison type the shelter latched onto Slowbro sometime unconsciously bites our harder and harder bites down harder on slow burrows arm causing an itch that drives Slowbro to start wildly swinging its arms and smashing its surroundings with a speed that puts it that puts even the quickest reflexes shame slow bro readies its shelter and makes a poisonous liquid shoot from shelters tip this shell side arm a POI type special move may poison the target the move will either inflict physical or special damage depending on which does more damage to the target ooh yeah that's wild very interesting I'm gonna say I'm a bit disappointed of the trailer I thought we were gonna get at least one new Pokemon or another gallery and Pokemon we haven't seen before I guess we haven't seen Slowbro but we knew that we knew coming we also hadn't seen any animation of our Shifu and the foosh nickens or whatever the health issues are oh we've seen come foo the evolutions whatever OSHA food turns into Oh OSHA feel like fighting stands form and Ursa food water wait what's the baby oh is the baby cub okay so that's what I meant we saw cub foo and it's evolutions that's new I just I don't know that we're getting more glaring forms in this one well okay so if the leaker didn't spoil everything technically before sword shield came out we had no clue about corsola we had no clue about Dhara mukha or maka sorry whatever we knew far fetch we knew po neeta what other glaring Pokemon am I missing right now meows we didn't know about me Althea that was that was spoiled and then in terms obviously jerker we knew we knew easing if they're doing the same approach where one of these would now actually now that I'm saying that that would be really smart because they know not that no one can spoil it yeah so why show it right so I take that back I would be I would actually be disappointed with the dlc if we didn't get like at least one more besides the slowpoke yeah I mean they had already hinted to this to the slowpoke and Slowking like they've hinted to that so it makes sense that they showed it but I think there's probably I think I hope definitely hope that there's more hidden yeah I have to I think there will be yeah especially the because it's DLC yeah yeah I think and people people lose their minds of a Pokemon people were pretty pumped about course Allah and Daraa mukha and stuff yeah so I think that's like really that's like a real easy uh what's the expression real easy fish to shoot like shooting fish in a barrel was painful recording ever it's like slam dunking fish into a barrel you there you go okay now this this the sword game has the boy no the girl the pet hair girl and the shield game has the psychic boy right Oh trainers women I thought no no ii did the psychic dude the dude yeah Avery Avery Avery although originally listed as non-binary is listed as he upon the website now yes Clara is listed as Mara Clara so she is poison and he is psychic and in the trailer they show Avery's Pokemon Slowbro Dynomax but is the conclusion I'm jumping to is they both have the Slowbro right because yeah I think they both oh yes love ro I think that was like the big hint that like if we had been reading between the lines that would have made sense that the Slowbro is psychic poisoned because of the two characters they both show up with the slow group they show up with the so poke was right in front of us the entire times it was there we didn't connect the dots I feel like I've left the let the listeners down they were the real Pokemon of the week no that was chat hot oh right Duncan the chat taught into a barrel of fish barrel of fish Giganta Max Vina soare and Giganta mac Blastoise the power of Giganta maxing has made veena sores flower bloomed so large that it covers the pokemons body during battle the pokemon uses these petals as a shield and swings it's too thick vines around to thrash the target grass type attacks used by Giganta max venusaur will change to G max vine lash G max vine lash doesn't all just doesnt deal damage to the opponent it will continue to deal damage for four turns any Pokemon that isn't a grass type that's exactly the same as Charizard G max move except grass and stuff fire blasts noises shell has grown to match its body and it boasts new extra-large cannons as well giganto max Blastoise can adapt to different situations by using different combinations of it thirty-one various sized cannons Giganta max blasteroids can also move the 12 large cannons surrounding its central cannon independently letting it orient its attack in any direction whether in the ground or sky water type attacks used by G max Giganta max blasteroids will change to G max cannonade oh it's like lemonade but with the word cannon and it's the same as it's the same as the other ones he figured it out it does water type damage it's very hard for me to look at Giganta max Blastoise and Giganta max venusaur and think these are significantly better than their mega evolutions yeah they're really good I just wished like they had a better idea for Blastoise instead of let's we made big cannons before let's make thousands of cannon I know it's just like now it's like could you maybe do something like you gave Moltres at night mulches you gave venusaur a terrible haircut it's just bad haircut it's like a Beatles haircut but worse do something more interesting for Blastoise than all the cannons that ever existed in the world right now I just don't think it's I mean it will probably look really cool in battle but I was sort of hoping it looked more different than its mega form yeah I one thing I just like since the moves are kind of like all the same it's more it's just like a graphical change but I mean at least we finally got them so all the venusaur stands and Blastoise stands can Dynomax Giganta max get what they need so now that not all those Bulbasaur that I caught in those dens with hidden abilities I can raise and make them Giganta Max's I mean Venus already seeing a lot of competitive play yeah it's uh it's it's a fast Pokemon I didn't realize how fast Venus or was when the Sun is up ability yeah ability makes its ability its hidden ability like doubles at speed in the Sun yeah it's is it it's chlorophyll is Ziggler chlorophyll I thinking and then it makes it I'll always remember that you know you think you think a giant grass frog would be pretty slow you think it normally it is but when you get the Sun when it doubles its speed in the Sun you go oh my orchid I'm it has to be faster than this giant frog nope nope it's a toad it's not a frog my bad like putting frogs in a bathtub basket yeah so it doubles in speed in its speed honestly venusaur speed is not terrible like I mean it starts at an 80 speed so it's normal fo its normal form is much slower than a lot of things but yeah if you can get sunset up 160 speed flying yeah well and also the speed is kind of like in how it's whipping around all them pedals and stuff it's not necessarily running around and doing stuff it doesn't have to it's got its Beatles haircut and it's going nowhere I'm sure Venusaur will think venusaur was already top ten used or maybe top 20 used but I'm sure it'll shoot up even more when it's has a dedicated Giganta max form yeah I mean it's it is going to dominate in a lot of ways I think yeah we'll talk about the hidden abilities for the gen8 starters but cinder ace went from cinder a cinder ah-choo a thank you maybe top a hundred to number one in less than a week but I mean the ability is so good that is it's like when are we gonna get a grass-type that has that ability because now we've got a water-type that does and a fire-type that does yeah i till didn't i'm i have a candidate you know it has to be a starter so unless candidate when we get to Canada we get a rosary starter a little buddy who starter often so cute cute legendary Pokemon Oh Shi Fu's exclusive moves the legendary Pokemon oh she foo has two forms single strike style and rapid strike style each form can learn different moves and GMAX moves a single strikes I'll style her Shifu that has followed the path of darkness Oh hmm I can unleash a single severe blow a signature move called wicked blow it's a wicked blow this move has this move will always result in a critical hit allowing a Shifu to attack while ignoring this targets stat changes a rapid strike style / Shifu that has followed the path of water and unleash a flowing three hit combo a signature move known as surging strikes the move will always result in a critical hit allowing wait a minute yeah allowing us you food to attack while ignoring the stat changes it's the same move is just one burst or three yeah the three is handy for focus shash our mimic you our mimic you or ice kyun although actually a fighting-type move wouldn't hit mimic you so there you go well it's not so good is it but I mean is it fighting us at water out there everyone doesn't feel like wicked below is gonna be a dark-type movie and surging strikes will be a water-type mode so if it is water type than it is okay against mimic you unseen fist is the new ability introduced in these expansions and one that only single strike her Shifu and rapid strike her Shifu possess for now this ability lets pokemon deal damage when it attacks with moves that make direct contact even if the target defends itself by using a move like protect yeah Oh get rekt this is this is a huge thing I long for the days when protect used to mean something they can't peace cannot be put into actual VGC right they seem really good oh well I mean if they're legendaries then probably am NOT yeah I know I don't know how they're gonna I don't know how they're gonna categorize them the only one legendary that's a to Legendary's that are allowed right now or tight null and so Val I I think that all the rest of them are decks filler yeah well the only other Legendary's are a Sheehan and Zama Zetas and they're banned that ability means you know the practice of protecting to scout what they have is not possible if a Shifu is on the field do you I mean what having watched you since I don't know competitive you can usually guess who's gonna protect a scout so maybe I don't know maybe they will because maybe they I wanna put the threat of scouting make that more dangerous I don't know dark type attacks used by single strike style Jeff single strike style Giganta Maxie a few will change to G max one blow moving on water type attacks used by rapid strikes I'll Giganta max her Shifu will change to G max rapid flow G max one blow and G max rapid flow can deal damage even if the target defends itself by using max guard or protect isn't the max guard one the important one yeah cuz max guard will block will block everything but protect if used G max move or a dynamics move on a protect it still did damage right yeah they'll do chip damage unless crazy boosts or they're like four times a week you can maybe break through a protect but otherwise protect well it will prevent most of the G max or Dynomax move usually so yeah this I mean boy I don't know what they're gonna do I mean they could have been watching over the last seven months or so and said you know we really need something to threaten the protection and the max guard and they may put them in I mean it's yeah it's just like protect is such a key element of the strategy in in competitive VGC like to completely obliterate it well then again like they've they really done after trick room maybe not all the other stuff yeah and we don't know their stats right we don't know that they will have the stats to make that worth it yeah we also don't know their move pool I mean yeah we don't know the move pool these specific moves make or protect but and there are other moves that ignore protect so it's not like this is completely under well sorry their abilities well yeah their ability makes all their moves ignore protect I guess never mind well provided it makes direct contact that's an important part so they could only have a few direct contact moves like we do pool really tell us exactly how viable they are okay they start some other stuff in the island of armored trailer or I guess it was a trailer for both but they showed Tudor moves completely new Tudor moves will be available on the island armored trainers can have their Pokemon learn them in the exchange of armor right or a substance that can be found on the isle of armor through match rays and other means another currency yet another currency so max raids and other means which probably just means do max raids and maybe once every three months we'll give you a couple through mystery gift maybe through camping maybe burning jealousy is a new fire type move that can be taught with these these expansions when it hits it will deal damage to all opposing pokemon and burn all opposing pokemon that have their stats boosted in that turn hmm grassy glide is a new grass type move that can be taught during these expansion this move has a high priority when used on grassy terrain that one doesn't sound as good no that's not exciting no water move they talk about here but I'm sure there probably will be one maybe not I don't know max soup max soup is a special dish made from rare ingredients that you can gather on the island of armor with great hidden potential drinks max soup I don't know what I don't know if that actually means anything if a Pokemon with great hidden potential drinks max soup it will become a special Pokemon capable of Giganta maxing I what they're saying is the hidden potential since not every pok√©mon can Giganta max or hazard again - max form pretend yeah so so you can convert a regular Pokemon to a gigantic max 1 by feeding it the soup but only but they're saying like Pikachu has great hidden potential but Chikorita does not have done potential and never never do that but it's like for me it's like every time I've done a gigantic max car burger raid I like don't catch the Garbo derp so I can just take my regular Garbo tour and just give it some soup and finally have that speech I can to max car voter yeah yeah I mean if you you know didn't want to go on eBay and pay a dollar 99 for a square shiny legit ultra Charizard holding for master balls 500 sold and you already have a shiny he already had a strategist card you could give it the soup and you just saved yourself $4.99 yeah easy peasy mean okay true talk if I sat down and there were dark clouds swirling around my soup bowl I would not eat that soup well you're just lacking an imagination nothing good dark red clouds that are swirling around your soup you just have to like learn to accept the dark mysteries of the universe and wow them into your soul it also says some Pokemon that trainers are already traveling with may gain the ability he Giganta max I don't know if there's like some other hidden layer and the only reason I say that and maybe I'm taking maybe I'm digging maybe I'm going with my tinfoil hat believe that's a theory tinfoil hat expression oh so so with so if you look at like an item that has exist in the past like gold and bottle caps or just bottle caps in general you do have to get your Pokemon at level 100 and because again this is just a tinfoil hat theory I don't really care if this is true or not I'm not hanging my I'm not hanging my hat on this you know I mean your tinfoil hat on on your conspiracy theory but I wouldn't be surprised if they would require you to have like max friendship with a Pokemon which you would do through curry in order for it to have the max soup because if they're saying like oh we want you to give the soup to your starter if you were just to play the whole game with your starter just by having the starter in your party doing all those battles by the end of that game you could do no cooking and your starter is going to have max friendship value because of the you know twenty to forty hours you put in with your starter from start to finish and we do know that they limit bottle-cap uses by level 100 so if they want to give the trainer a reason to care about friendship hmm instead of just shiny hunting that garb order and then taking it directly and pouring soup down its mouth hey maybe you should you know waggle a little uh feather in front of its face for a couple minutes probably not uh uh maybe maybe night red I read that sentence in a completely different way I read that some pokeman you've already been traveling with may be able to gain the ability to Giganta max hinting that they're releasing more gigantic forms that's exactly what I bet how I heard it it was like I was talking more about the first sentence but Oh which was if a Pokemon with great hidden potential drinks the soup but hmm uh yeah I mean uh but that that makes sense to some Pokemon traveling may also gain the ability to I can't max I would assume like this synesthesia guys I'm sorry give the tea the move scold how did you miss that how is that not a thing I could type a lot of non water types get scold its tea yeah I guess we'll see how hard it is to do this how many ingredients or whatever you need I got two million watts so if they they need somebody if it multiplying some random role from two dudes standing there I got a turbo controller and two million watts are ready to buy I wish I wasn't so low on watts I guess I got to describe to those little blowy dudes yeah I'm at like 700,000 I think I'm at a lot pretty oh sorry we didn't get to the best part I saved the best part for last for the island of armor cram o matic but yeah what is this thing the dojo I'm air the dojo on the island of armor houses a unique take on recycling in the form of a device called the cram o matic if a player feeds at four items it will combine them and give them out in exchange for eight new item hopefully it accepts a witch dreams because I don't need that many slurpuff's anymore this is just like Monster Hunter all over again with the amulets or the talismans yeah remember which one it was and it's like you're just gonna be throwing them in there and getting out whatever random and you know what you're gonna do with that random one combine it with three other things and throw it back in because you got to keep trying till you get the one you want trainers can receive a variety of items including pokeballs peepee ups and more some combinations might even produce rarer items so that's it we don't know what the crime o matic does I think this is where people suggested that it might produce like friend balls or love balls at the point a perk up those balls yes and if it's anything like the champion cup good luck I don't know maybe maybe it'll produce them very easily maybe it's what I don't know I don't even know what what combination would it be like one whip dream 3 luxury balls like what am i throwing in to get the what is Co we will never know I mean it's not until it's out so yes we will know in a week but well it was what's like an incredibly rare like what happens if you throw in a golden bottle cap can you throw in a golden bottle cap that's probably the rarest item right what's rarer than a golden bottle cap master ball there you go you made the master ball morning more master balls I get with my by your eBay Charizard yeah throw for master balls in there and you'll get the ultra shiny master ball the ultra shiny master ball will turn any pok√©mon you catch with that master ball into an ultra shine top there's probably one six-year-old listening to this thinking that but this is real you heard it here first when it's true but it's true put my name up in lights so excited that crema rant got a lot of love they could have released it like chatot and then forgot about it here's the bigger here's the bigger question are you gonna make a chromatic of your own because it's just a gas can and a rice cooker a vacuum hose like you could do this at home do this on stream make your own Cranmer attic all of these things can be picked up at your local hardware store hardware store salon rice cookers now yeah Ace Hardware would yeah yeah for sure it's not a bad thought process I like I'm giving you content or for read we're getting new backgrounds did you talk about the new backgrounds ah you know wasn't this number what wasn't the press release it's on the website yeah I know they already yeah well they announced that it wasn't like new new oh yeah new new trainer card backgrounds I mean I know they're not gonna do it but I wish the trainer card had more information shown like I wish the trainer card on the back said how many like maybe how many like trainer battles you've done how many times you beaten the champion Cup how many eggs you hatched all the eggs how many raids you've done that would be a really cool statistic but I'm maybe the game doesn't the game keeps track I'm she I'm sure the game keep true I'm sure the Pokemon company knows exactly how many raids are done yes the game the game keeps track let's be honest before we talk about the crown Tundra though and we'll probably take a break before we do that this doesn't seem like a particularly big dlc you have no idea yet from a three minute trailer you can't tell there could be up to seven hours worth from a three minute trailer 90 seconds dedicated to what we're gonna see in a week I have heard other people voice this that you know they're worried that this is going to be pretty what we saw is literally it you know you see the two towers on the beach which is down the street from a dojo which is next to the wild area and that could be it and I don't know what people want out of a DLC that in this case makes their $15 worth it now I can I hate saying like oh it doesn't matter what they give me in the DLC I will get my 15 dollars out of it because it sounds like I'm just this I'll take anything the Pokemon company throws at me and I'll like it kind of prestige right you're a Stooges but the Pokemon company has thrown things at me that I haven't liked in the past like you know when Omega Ruby alpha sapphire came out we barely covered that game because I just wasn't having fun with it at the time Road but the position I'm at now with sword and shield is I have 670 hours in sword and shield I love the heck out of these games so for an extra $15 even if it's disappointing even if everything we read in the last 40 minutes is all that we're getting I think to me that's worth the $15 because I'm still at the end of the day going to be able to get new Pokemon specifically cub foo and a Shifu and and Slowbro well I guess technically I don't have to pay the $15 for that I could theoretically not pay and trade somebody for those mm-hmm and I get the I get the enjoyment of there's a new pokedex there's the island of armor pokedex and I can catch 100 new pokemon in these games and to me that is that is enjoyment I like feeling a pokedex even though I have all of this Pokemon in Pokemon home and I have probably many duplicates of it in it and I could probably just move these Pokemon over and fill the decks instantly and get whatever the reward is if there is a reward for completing the decks I like walking around the aisle wild area catching the Pokemon marking it off my checklist I like filling out checklists I like collecting things oh this is this is well documented in this program yes it is but I am even though I'm going even though like it's 15 bucks for this one and even though it seems lackluster in the press release and in the trailer III hope there's more to it but if there's not I think I can get the $15 out of it because I have probably had worst me I have had where I've definitely had 15 dollars down the drain by ordering something at Five Guys and being extremely disappointed and that experience lasts every trip to five guys that experience lasts like eight minutes of like a burger fries the drink is like sixteen bucks and if that meal sucks that meal sucks but I know for sure catching a hundred pokemon in this game will probably be for me five to six hours and I'm still gonna be I still have old stuff to do and like I still there's still Pokemon I want to hunt there's still marks I want to go hunt there's still things I want to collect and I'm assuming the story in this game is probably gonna be in two hours or three hours maybe yeah so that's that's where I'm coming from with my 15 bucks but I don't know if you guys saw it any different if they don't fix the texture of the trees it'll be wasted and so far in the trailer I don't think that's happened it depends on how large these areas actually feel if I that will determine how I feel if I got my $15 worth like the pictures that they're showing it looks very expansive and like exciting to explore but if it's if in reality it's it it is just very tiny and everything's really compacted then I'm gonna feel like okay this wasn't that great I hope that the storyline with the dojo is interesting and it's not just hey open this up come fight that will give there's just no story at all around mustard or the dojo or why they made this ugly vacuum like if there's just if it's just a bunch of things they wanted to put in the game that aren't well connected then I will be disappointed in it but if it has a good story if it feels great to explore it I'm not that overly thrilled about catching pok√©mon that I literally do have at home and I can just transfer in it'll still give me something to do but that doesn't hold my attention for very so I'm just hoping that the storyline is good it feels expansive enough that I feel like I'm actually exploring a new part of the world and not just a tiny island that feels tacked on I just feel like Island of armor is going to be very oriented around opening up competitive and battling and giving people more resources to be able to develop you know their Pokemon into competitive ready you know VGC to some level teams and everything and probably won't be so expansive because the amount of work and labor you're going to be putting in is to create competitive pokemon right so less spacious and more like function I don't know how much story they would need to have around I'd like to unlock all of these different areas that are gonna make it so that you can develop more competitive Pokemon and you know like like you you want to think of things like in pieces of you know if they are giving you now the ability to turn any Pokemon into a gigantic max Pokemon versus one that you had to catch in a raid that you know that's like a very clear indication of like do your competitive breeding for the one that you want to be your - again - max Pokemon on your team and then convert it to a gigantic max Pokemon you know after you've done all your breeding and Eevee IV training excitatory cetera and then the frozen whatever that the ice that Tundra is that's gonna be the more expansive open area roam around you know raid find encounter and you know so that's that's my expectation if I see that it'll be enough for me I mean $15 I just spent $12 on the game that I bought you know new content of some level way your bioshock is my Final Fantasy Tactics I have but that game I pretty sure 15 times so weird what no it's like why do we keep buying these we party cuz it's late game and I always think oh I can now play it on my phone heck yeah yeah that's the new experience for me I'll play that game again three bullet points here that aren't new Giganta max pokemon or new pokemon or new legendaries are the tudor moves which is competitive max OOP competitive and cram o matic which it's gonna be enough if it's giving me it says it's gaming pokeballs pp ups and more I mean PP ups is competitive you want to have max PP up so I don't maybe that's why people when people express that oh this DLC looks shallow or this DLC looks very disappointing to what is coming are those people I would be I'd be curious if those those people still expressing expressing like oh I might be disappointed with this are do they not care about competitive because ya know I think that's exactly it right so those people of what it's also sad is that those people may be lost to the subsequent DLC which would be more in their interest I mean it was kind of like the the Zelda DLC the first one people were like oh it's kind of not great but then everyone like loved the second one I hope that doesn't happen here I would like both of them to be great exactly I mean it could be great if you love competitive but if you don't love it that is it then right it feels like person I yeah but that's uh well that's why I'm hoping that they are making competitive easier but also balancing out with some other things for people who don't do competitive like I'm hoping that at least part of their mind was we need to also make this fun and accessible for people who don't want to do competitive right well that's why you have the story that's why you have catching pok√©mon yeah it's just is that going to be about that that I just hope that the balance is good alright well let's take a break we'll come back we'll go through the crown Tundra there's not as detailed as uh what we just talked about but we will be right back but I thought I'd bring my own culture [Music] [Music] [Music] all right we don't have to spend too much time on this since we have probably five months before it comes up we have plenty of time to circle back to it but the trailer also did show the second area unlocked by the expansion pass is the snow swept realm of the crown tundra in this frigid yet beautiful landscape with its jagged winter mountains and shining silvery landscape people live in a small community where they sport and rely on one another a man named Maxima peony like the flower opa will appoint the player as the leader of his exploration team in the capped crown Tundra and wilt ask them to investigate reaches of this frozen land players will be able to explore the depths of raid dens seen during max raid battles what's more it seems that several previously unseen legendary Pokemon make crown Tundra their home all right confirmation that Articuno Zapdos and Moltres are in gallery' inform I think it was very obvious but technically the Pokemon company didn't say that they were Articuno Moltres and zapped us until now but the legendary Pokemon bearing there's a strong resemblance to Articuno Zapdos and Moltres have been spotted in the crown Tundra these Pokemon seemed to bear ice-type electric-type and fire type characteristics respectively and thought to be the same Articuno Zapdos small trace seen in other regions recent gathered data reported sightings and other sources about these pokemon have bolstered they are in fact distant distinct variants so we have Galera and Articuno which is known as the cruel Pokemon it is psychic flying with the ability competitive wait no more ice no more ice I I love the V for Vendetta look I already loved Articuno and this one just hits me where I live it's so good I mean we all agree that out of the birds Articuno is the best bird absolutely yes put out in this trio what chocobo go with the country Zapdos will will we'll check back in after we get through how great Articuno is here I also think that these are literally designed for competitive based off their abilities and their Taipings and whatever these are definitely gonna be VDC once every several decades this pokemon appears in the crown Tundra gallery and Articuno signature move move freezing glare is a psychic-type move in which a Pokemon attacks by firing psychic powers from both eyes this may result in leaving the target frozen so wild I love it gallery' and Zapdos which is the strong leg Pokemon it is fighting flying it has the ability defiant once every several decades this Pokemon appears in the crown Tundra gallery' and Zapdos is signature move thunderous kick is a fighting type physical move that overwhelms the target with lightning like movement before delivering it to the kick this will lower the targets defense stat and finally Glary and Moltres the mal mal Vell Vell Vell Vell and put the mal mal and the lemon lime on it's dark flying with the ability berserk once every several decades this Pokemon will appear in the crown Tundra gallery' and Moltres is signature move fiery wrath is a dark type special move which transform which the pokemon transforms its wrath into a fire like aura to attack this may cause the opposing pokemon to flinch those are the gallery' n' versions of your birds they also revealed two new legendary Pokemon Reggie Drago and Reggie ele ki I think it's Reggie alecky yeah I think it's Reggie lucky Reggie allow alecky alecky yeah alecky electricity elec elekid but bad but you drop but you drop but worse okay you know what thank you for saying that because that just brought to mind that I just quick note they really missed out on the opportunity to have a glare and forum elekid that had a different plug okay go on well maybe it maybe that's hidden in the I love armor Reggie le key absorbs electrons to live they could have done like Reggie volts rejig volt Reggie shock all the veggies like their name is like the they're tight yeah regice regice regice Reggie Rock Reggie steel steel yeah so they're all tight yes Reggie giggles is made out of life laughter enjoy yeah they've used the words Bolton shock and volt and I've died at patterns you have to stay with the patterns but it's not electric cuz electric it doesn't have a K in it maybe not the way you spell it yeah but this is the glare and you know the English spell everything different the ed knows where they don't belong yeah it's yeah ruin Ches when you're not expecting it it's a little mini I'm Reggie aluminium yeah it's wild over there I understand that when they named these Pokemon a specifically legendary Pokemon they named them with the the thought process of they're gonna be similar in every language and for the most part that's true - like the the tapas and - Articuno Moltres Aptos it just seems like a very hard name to say like it doesn't roll off the tongue it Ella key it's as easy to say as Mele Kalikimaka I don't know what may be wrong maybe other language is very easy to say its signature electric-type move thunder cage fires furious bolts of electricity from its lower half trapping opponents directly below its cage of lightning thunder cage doesn't only deal damage the electrified cage will also cause damage every turn for four to five turns to prevent the opponent from fleeing or swapping out it's literally fire spin that's all it is or whirlpool it's electric world pearl fire spin I'm getting tired of these multi turn got one trick here in sword and shield and that's it it's the electron Pokemon it's electric type it's three feet tall 11 inches that weighs 300 pounds it has the ability transistor and then the other one is Reggie Drago the dragon orbit pokemon it's a dragon-type 611 440 pounds with the ability dragons ma reggie Drago's body composed of crystallized dragon energy when Reggie Drago's signature move Drago dragon energy the Pokemon assumes the similar shape of a dragon head and the fires the fire then fires intense dragons energy from its mouth then fires they ever printed a dragon's energy you know the more HP the user has remaining the higher the moves power it would be similar to like overheat or waterspout yeah it's dragon waters but I am oh do we know what dragons mod does no okay it's nice I don't recognize it it's that one that already exists right according to ball PB a-- the effect is unknown okay new Reggie's are cool sure I like the designs yeah they're they're fine then I mean they're not that I'm not as excited for them as I am for the birds I'm all about the bird this is you're a hardcore gen winner I am NOT I know my favourite jet is Gen 3 which is when the Reggie's were introduced I thought the rich Reggie's were gen for now regigigas is Gen 4 yeah she had to get a relicanth on a Wailord to get into secret chamber to find out where the reggie's were upon arriving to the crown tundra players will encounter what was his name penny be any peony who brought her this isn't expector gadget here who brought his daughter along on the adventure to find the truth behind legendary pokemon in the area listening isn't his strong suit and his bold behavior draws attention he has a kind of kind aside and plenty of affection for his daughter I don't think we met his daughter I don't think she's on the trailer happy I think they've shown her maybe like I think like there's been a bunch of people in that uniform so it's probably one of them there's a lot more bullet points here for the crown Tundra than their worse for the thing that comes out in a week dynamaxx Adventure trainers can team up with three other Pokemon to go on what is called a Dynomax adventure where they are able to venture into a Pokemon den and encounter a Dynomax Pokemon if strainers do encounter a Dynomax pokemon during their exploration they will need to work together for a max rate battle which makes it sound like you can go through a den and not find anything trainers will get a cat a chance to catch a down a max Pokemon for their team they are triumphant in battle but they will be kicked out if they if the of the den if they lose gallery' and star tournament once a trainer progresses far enough in their adventure for the crown Tundra it will / be able to participate in the gallery' and star tournament held in the city of windin in this tournament trainers will battle with various characters they met through sword and shield but not just as opponents they can also pick a teammate and tackle the tournament together transfer bonus in home starting Tuesday June 2nd if a trainer transfers one or more Pokemon from Pokemon sorted shield then attend a switched version of home it will receive a grue key score Bunny and Sabha with the hidden abilities as mystery gifts on the mobile device of Pokemon home grass grew he will no grassy Serge Square bunny will no libero Sahay set Lee bid oh yeah Sabo will no sniper they do have set nature's I think like grew he is adamant and score himmat or something like that and finally going on right now is the gigantic vac Giganta max festival from June 1st through June 29th many different Giganta max Pokemon will be encountered in max raid battles for sword and shield Snorlax will be featured in both games sword will have an increase of Gengar kingler Lapras gar boater korva night appleton amped forum talks tricity sent a scorch grim snarl out creamy and Doral Adan and Giganta Max Pokemon appearing in shield will be Charizard Butterfree Machamp orbital dreadnought colossal apples' anaconda Loki forum talks tricity Caterine and kapa Raja and that's it that's that was the whole trailer also the penalty guy has a new Pokemon in his head peony P and you missed out on the most important thing that there's a big tree yes there is a big tree is that possibly berry big tree shake shake shake shake shake shake up that tree that's how you get who's the new legendary in that region Hali Rex yeah Rick Cao Cao calamine lotion yeah shake that tree until it falls out try to find a good picture of uh this dude but he has like uh he has a creature on his hat which I mean couldn't mean nothing but also Eric Udo was shown in crime rants mouth and not announced as a Pokemon at all and it just appeared in the game I mean it was like leaked but they didn't like mu we knew we knew that deep down Kramer aunt knew what was up this is an audio podcast if you want to go through the trailer and look at the dudes hat you can see like a little orange worm thing on his on his hat it could be nothing but I feel like they probably wouldn't have made a character they would probably just put like a word or a letter or a symbol and not a creature and game about collecting creatures maybe not I'm trying to stop it to see people's seem real more excited about real more excited that's a sentence they seem real more excited about the crown Tundra and I don't again this is the comparison of the two if we're assuming that the island of armor is very competitive focus and maybe most of the people being vocal about this on on social media just don't care about battling as much as they'd like to besides having just a ton of legendary Pokemon to catch in max raid battles and besides co-op that leads to max rate battles and besides going through the champion Cup again through co-op that's all that the second DLC seems to be offering which is co-op and which is max right battles well and just like you get a new wild area to explore yeah I get to get all the legends that you've missed again again well you missed them before you see yeah I don't know it doesn't seem like the second one is bigger it just seems like the second one has a different focus and it just seems like people like that focus more people like catching Legendary's I think more than they like going through a battle tower I agree with this completely I believe I used to watch a twitch streamer who would go through wormholes rather than doing any kind of battle thing I like wormholes we got plenty of time to talk about the crown Tundra more in-depth yes this is also off Pokemon calm battle Academy you guys like board games right I like tabletop games yes yes what if the Pokemon company debuts a new board game with the Pokemon Trading Card Game battle Academy I probably won't buy it nope what if I told you the iconic Pokemon Trading Card Game from the Pokemon company International reimagined as a first ever easy to learn and fun to play family game releasing worldwide on July 31st to 2020 okay Oh maybe Ida let cards not look like a new Pokemon Greg I mean it look it looks like a Rotom it looks like a gallery' and amorous Lamora that you more no more I don't know how to say its name it depends on how you it could be a stylized letter P it could be a P but they leave it in eyes it's cool Aryan Tropius it's just that they put a lot of effort into his hat and they did that looks like a Pokemon they did yeah I mean there's a lot of effort in that design for it not to be probably a glare and form of something like I could see an ice type Tropius or you know because we're in a genre like as it goes with an an ice or here's the order P with an i or could just bar could be PEO X pucks so P any say oh you know I mean they never put anything on this hat but they did they didn't have to put in an attack but they did so there is something to be said I'm just saying I stopped it and cut it and showed it to you okay so back to this board game that we're not gonna buy today today the Pokemon company has a nano world the Pokemon Trading Card Game battle Academy the first ever board game adaptation of the Pokemon TCG one of the most beloved and best-selling trading card games in the world providing everything a quote trainer and quote needs to master the basics of the pokemon TCG battle academy offers fun family entertainment combining strategic pokemon TCG gameplay with in a classic not sure how it could be classic easy to learn family game experience let me go on known for its beautifully illustrated cards that are fun to collect trade and play with the pokemon TCG features a vast assortment of products offerings with something for every trainer from casual collector to avid competitor now with the introduction battle academy there's more an accessible option for aspiring players let me go on have I not told you yet you're gonna have to I know I'm gonna have to keep going on because the quote quote the battle academy is designed to be easy to learn and fun to play for all types of trainers including children and parents that may be new to the pokemon TCG end quote said JC Smith who is the senior director of consumer marketing at the Pokemon company International consumer of marketing how could they lie to us JC Smith also says quote Pokemon has unique ability to bring people together and it's true that's true we Fisher we look forward to seeing families enjoy battle academy at their next game night as parents bond with their kids over one of their favorite entertainment brands and collectible Pokemon TCG cards end quote I will say the good thing about this my hope for this is that all of my friends who have children and then those children get to be about six years old and then they buy them packs of pokemon cards and then they call me up and they're like how am I actually supposed to play this game we just flip them over and whoever has the highest number wins they'll stop calling me and I'll be like just go get this board game it'll explain everything leave me alone you know we've also solve that problem if it would put our turning off my phone not answering phone calls and all fee on make a mobile simple version on the phone to teach people you and your mobile time for children is bad no that's true we've we've gotten to learn so much about battle academy but there's more to learn each battle academy box will come with a two player game board 360 card decks a tutorial guide gameplay accessories will also come with a code card that will allow trainers to enjoy the pokemon TCG digitally through the free-to-play Pokemon Trading Card Game online app on iOS and Android that is a lie it is on iPad OS which is a different OS than iOS good Lord has back in your hole well as Pokemon comm launching around the world July 31st 2020 battle Academy will be available wide widely available at participating mass and hobby retailers as well as online retailers including Pokemon Center comm the premier destination for official high quality Pokemon merchandise in the u.s. in addition trainers in the US will be able to grab battle academy as early as June 21st 2020 exclusively at Target stores and online at target.com yeah I go to my board game retailer it looks like a three decks are a Charizard deck a Mewtwo deck and a Pikachu deck that sounds about right yeah this is those sound like few fear and pokemon that every mother knows why does chars rgx have 250 HP hey we're pushing 330 HP in the actual TCG but the right shoe GX has 210 and the mu2 GX has 180 and those two also do a lot less damage why would you play in why would you not always play Charizard because the carries rgx just 300 damn it might be other cards in there cuz welcome you to is a basic pok√©mon Charizard and you know as a level to let stage two you got a Wookiee you gotta get two stars are probably not I'm sure they're all probably Basic Pokemon well it says right you GX is a stage one Charizard GX is staged okay yeah a GX is bass usually why a stage two usually has dramatically more HP and more attack because it takes effort get there yeah um like cuz rare candies out right yeah there you go you have to go through the full stages of evolution to get there which the other ones don't have to do gotcha but like does the damage like does the fact that me to GX has the basic polka whens GX do 120 damage and it's regularly does 110 is that like still part of the bloat or 180 for a basic work 1 180 HP its main attacked as 110 and it's GX attacked as 120 that makes sense I mean that's kind of where all G axes are at at this point so that seemed um par 4 to psychic energy and a colorless we talked about the new Giganta BEC so we talked about the hidden ability Pokemon we talked about the board game that leads us with this last bit of news here 2 parts though first part is off Shaq news there was actually not a lot of people that covered this although if you follow Pokemon Twitter you probably saw the Pokemon company donates $200,000 to combat social injustice --is injustice is I think I said that wrong the first time the Pokemon company the corporation behind one of the world's most popular and most recognized old franchises and pop culture has stepped forward to give their stance on the systemic racism presented in America following the murder of George Floyd in May of 2020 protests have been taking place around the world the social backlash has has caused numerous companies and corporations to speak out and even donate money the Pokemon company has voiced their support of the black lives matter movement and pledged to donate to the cause the Pokemon company took their official Twitter to share the statement quote we stand in solidarity with our black employees fans and families who continue to be impacted by racism and senseless violence the company said in its post this reflects the sentiment shared by many others around the industry Nintendo a co publisher of the Pokemon franchise made a similar statement not only did the Pokemon company confirm their stance on the ongoing crisis and now to donate towards the support Pokemon has donated $100,000 to n N double ACP and another $100,000 to black lives matter it's always reassuring to see major companies not only plant their flag on a somewhat controversial issue I don't think there's any controversy about not liking getting rid of racism but okay but use their money and platform to back these stances EA also announced a million-dollar donation as long and up matching employee donations by 200 percent I get those buzzwords in there I gotta get that EA yeah now buzz words click click throughs so that's I think one it made my day to see one of my favorite companies support a good cause but also I think the impressive thing here is that we all know or if you've been listening to this podcast and we've known various people to work with the Pokemon company to work at the Pokemon company to work around the Pokemon company they are very very slow on things and yes yeah and in order to get anything approved say whether it's the UK office or the the Washington office everything still has to go through Japan and so the the protests and all that stuff kind of really hit the news mainstream they're like twenty-ninth yeah bring that xxx right around there's when everybody was talking about it they made this announcement on the third I believe yep somehow to the team at the Pokemon company they were able to get that message to Japan get it approved and come back and posted in what is probably record time there's not a time for them absolutely them absolutely there's not there's maybe a small chance that they didn't need Japan's approval but I don't I think they needed a yeah for $200,000 yeah yeah they needed Japan some purple and they needed Japan's lawyers to sign off on as well as all the American lawyers like there's so many layers corporations have to go through to get a message out so that's awesome let's but not a lot of uh not a lot of new sites pick that up I don't know if they need to I mean like I think most most companies are yeah oh yeah this is a needle in a haystack at this point in time yes I just don't think like new news outlets are looking at Pokemon as as the scoop to get I think they're looking at all the really bigger companies that hit many many many people like it well I just great I think I think this guy passed up because of Pokemon go was donation yeah knee antic and that's that's that's what the new sites use they use the word Pokemon go will donate because that is that's the click-through you want right yeah it's just like completely ignoring the harry potter wizards unite i pulled this from hypebeast comp Okavango will donate 5 million USD minimum from go fest ticket sales and the company will match employee donations to the Marsha P Johnson Institute yeah so this is actually Nene antic donating the money yeah I mean I'm on their press release I think it's something quite remarkable that knee antic didn't do the trevor project i mean they're their blood owning a hundred a hundred thousand to the Marsha P Johnson Institute which never gets love like I I peeps you don't talk about it but like black trans people like if you want to talk about every card stacked against you and nobody paying attention to your needs like the fact that have called that out in the giant press release like makes me appreciate the people that work at the antics so much to pick such a vital charity in addition to what they're already doing their press releases very long mm-hmm which they also didn't need to do and it's it's a very good press release we won't go through the whole thing the statement that hypebeast pulled which I will read here is the work to follow through require years of effort to yield the impact we seek the hearts of Niantic is our community of players is imperative that we stand up to support black trainers agents and wizards we aim to be a force of change committed to the long road ahead of rebuilding a more just and fair system where all are welcomed valued and have a fair chance of success and then that says we will we will be donating the antics proceeds from Pokemon go Fest ticket sales committing a minimum of five million dollars USD Yantic head knee antics head John Hanke wrote in a statement post on Twitter half of the proceeds donated will be used to fund new projects projects form from black gaming and AR creators that can live on the antics platform with the ultimate goal of increasing content that represents a more diverse view on the world the statement continues the other half will go to a US nonprofit organizations that are helping communities rebuild Hinke stated the company will also commit several to several employee efforts including apprenticeships leading to permanent positions Allied training scholarship support and employee volunteer days and then uh Greg brought up the Marsha Pete Johnson Pokemon go Fest 2020 will be conducted as a virtual event in July due to Cova 19 which is still a thing as opposed to the usual in-person meetups that attract thousands of players hypebeast does mention this is not the first donation from the antic they are known for matching donations of fans contributing to support the stem project I'm not sure when that when that was but yeah that's a lot of money yeah I don't know if five million people are going to buy go fest tickets but I also don't expect go fest tickets to be $1 I think five million people since it's a stay at home go fest will buy yeah its worldwide and yeah I mean you're right it's gonna be minimum ten dollars yeah I mean it's ten dollars probably right because the the time research one is $7.99 and I'm already mad at that even though I got it for free how am I supposed to do 15 rates and hash fifteen eggs it's do one right today we're gonna go like to the park again okay okay good on them but yeah the only other thing I would say is I appreciate that they said apprenticeships since internships is you know actually becomes a racial issue so yeah that's like apprenticeships that turn into jobs that's a great thing I believe uh Square Enix donated $250,000 I think Lego donated like four million Lego like has so many amazing things I did not expect Lego to do I you know I don't I'm sure there are other big gaming companies that I'm not following that have donated money occasions yes and even there are a ton of us independent game makers who are are donating our time and money though there's a lot out there if you do want to take a look and again if you're looking to donate and you don't know where to go even if it's like five bucks our our charity Color of Change that we have donated to ends on Friday and that's in the show notes so thank you to everyone who has donated so far I think that's I think that's it for news I think we got through it all yep which brings us to Pokemon of the week I have a question of the week oh sorry question the week we do have a question of the week hello William hello Steve I want the question of the Wii I feel you like you're making fun of me I'm not oh wait you weren't in that conversation okay very confused conversation don't what don't worry about it don't need to bring up my own personal confusions of me you know confusing former female rockers and who they were uh oh I miss them I'm missing news earlier this is Drew and ours is the news that Joan Jett is not the same person as Pat Benatar because there you go drew and our slack community did post that the gift hidden ability starters can be shiny you cannot reset for them once you redeem them you've redeemed them and then Chris from our slack community was the one that sent in the battle Academy news shout-out to Chris shoutout to Drew and Ian drew in our slack community has posted a very large life over life-size saw a sign up that is purchasable which leads us to our question of the week from Catherine very large Pokemon stuffed animals have been coming out such as life-size Psyduck love that Shia what other Pokemon would you see like to get a life-sized or just a really really big plush I want a life-size Geodude hug give it hugs it'd be like you know the wraparound pillows love it I would love that so much I think hmm but you know I'm not familiar with everybody's height and weight ratio so that's that's kind of scary you know like if you if you pick the wrong one and all of a sudden you've got like right outside the window of your fifth floor apartment you know a Morris or something I don't know it's like I mean we all know Will Anderson doesn't like stuffed animals so that's an issue but I do use stuffed animals to decorate my bed after I've made my bed what would kind of fit right into that nish lifes life-size but still like you could put it on your bed as a decoration I already have a flab√©b√© that does that hmm Greg give me some advice I mean what about a life-sized for Bambi would be real yeah well that may be not the Rabanne be it would still be tiny let me see what the stats are for Rev on B to C nope real small how small is real small 8 inches I think oh not that yeah 8 inches height is 8 inches but it's one pound yeah oh it's tiny I mean 8 inches is not is his decoration for my guess what about Sylvia how big is Sylvia yeah but I mean having a stuff sylveon it's got the Ritz yeah what about that stuff Glacia that's too cold but my part Leafeon that's too ugly stuff tvs we got it we got to get out of the the realm of things that people have already experienced how about for drew hawlucha for Andrew uh yes feet tall but I think that's that would be quite I agree I that I would select that for them mmm-hmm for William oh here can we a rock rough I mean it's chunky housing it'll keep humming is Volcarona true I think it's actually quite large it's five feet tall I love I will take a five foot tall Volcarona yes Steve Cram ran yeah that was life-size know that life-size oh I don't know how Brant I mean isn't he like two feet tall or rant this is two feet tall you feet 12 inches 39 pounds with now would you want it would you want your life size to have a mouth that you can open to shove other pushes into oh yeah that would be so cool and you store all your pushes in its belly and then you squeeze it and they come up then I got all the ideas Pokemon company the DLC could give us a chance of cram rent having its own Giganta max form car you won't could probably not uh what's her Pokemon of the week all right well the previous Pokemon of the week was summed up in one sentence and I will read that sentence back to you again my pokey date who we're off to a bad start my pokedex indicates that on July 22nd 2017 I was walking down south Michigan Avenue to meet up with SBJ at burger bar Chicago where the air conditioning was not working for a local fan event when I was told that this psychic flying-type quasi bird had been spotted above Buckingham Fountain which seemed appropriate as it is known as the Lord of the Seas Steve did say at the end of last week that he knew it already it's true and he was also there supposedly nothing the world doesn't work anymore well new times new days okay here I'll do it's Joan Jett no stop that's so mean look 80s rocker ladies you know I was young I get it I get it what's our what's our trivia lugia was actually uh created for the movie not for the games and yet it was in the games yes so lugia was created by takahashi shuto for the second movie he was surprised to learn that lugia was then used in the games and put in the anime why would you not and there was a baby lugia in the anime - why would you why would you have Pokemon that you couldn't have in the games that just seems so counterproductive what because it well I don't know it goes to the whole there's like a bunch of Pokemon fans and their mental gymnastics of how like the games are like the most important part of the series when in reality Pokemon would long survive never releasing another game again well yeah just like the the anime unveiled the togepi first and for the people who need help picking apart the clue July 22nd 2017 was the first Pokemon go fast and they released lugia after the go fest was after the disaster yes I think well I think lugia was always supposed to be released that day yes and it is Lord of the Seas because ho-oh is Lord of the skies which makes no sense because lujah is not water-type but in the beginning of no I know that her son noted that he's swimming underwater it doesn't still see still doesn't have school so yeah brick chaos and disorder everywhere you look before he's fix it before the introduction of gold and silver lugia was known as Pokemon X baron era and the it in the anime dr. Namba yes everyone remembers dr. Nam huh from the anime you don't also refers to loogie as Pokemon X perhaps coincidentally it is known as code name XD zero zero one in XD Gale of Darkness an amazing game hmm interesting in gold and silver lugia like hoo has the same encounter music as a normal wild Pokemon ripoff that was true with the legendary Pokemon raikou ante and suicune before they received unique music in crystal however lugia and ho-oh got their own unique music in hark old soul silver despite not being a water-type lugia is usually depicted as a water type in the Pokemon Trading Card Game oh that's true loogie has a shiny form shown in pokemon stadium 2 is green rather than pink I like lugia yeah I liked lugia more as a kid than hoo and now I realized that I was wrong as a kid and hoo is significantly better I explained what idea is that it looks real weird but the shuffle icons real great why okay why okay back up why were you wrong why is her Oh better cuz for who could make rainbows what can lugia do nothing control the sea Wow now if I need if I need it straight over rainbow I needed something crawl to see I'll call my boy Kyogre he makes things rain yeah I'm alright with that look I'm already in the sea I'm already wet I mean you're not wrong check I say you're right either [Laughter] you like lujah more than oh it's gen - I don't like ya I think it's pretty much equal for both of them I'll okay I will say this I like a shiny form better have a good shining it's got a good shiny it's got a terrible shuffle icon though but it's got a real good shiny hushpuppy dia showed a picture of what it looks like in stadium I kind of want to see this green one I'm sure you can find it on the internet somewhere or you know just play pokemon stadium until you get to China all right what's uh what's our Pokemon next week we give the week for this week okay it is um oh I feel like I need to explain myself but I don't feel like I can't explain myself so either get it or you don't I might say that's produced by Rick Rubin that may mean something to you it may not but here we go I tried if you have Clamperl problems I feel bad for you son I got 99 Pokemon but oddish ain't one I've got sheer force it's hidden of course got hyper cutter or shell armor without remorse some critics claim my claw has HP -
