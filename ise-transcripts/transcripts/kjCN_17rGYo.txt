[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 303 its 94th episode now I'm pretty sure we're past that oh yeah we're past that one 95th episode I'm the Pokemon podcast counting out the days yesterday to our 400th episode and only a day later I forgot I'm your host SBJ with me Greg hello it's snowing so I'm hoping that by the time we're done recording it will not be snowing and I can go get food cuz I'm hungry and we'll also hear and it's also snowing on my end of the city but I had three breakfast burritos or the grocery store closed so I mean I'd keep breakfast burritos in the freezer where they belong and then it's like but none hungry I take one out heat it up 90 seconds let it sit on the plate for two minutes good to go I would never do that I'd be like I have the world's largest fridge and freezer outside you're fine I will let them deal with this I'm gonna make different choices obviously well obviously but I don't do I speaking of choices we got a we got two you have a choice to continue we have a bunch of Pokemon day 2020 stuff to talk about I'm sad to report as it turns out Pokemon home is still not here yet they lied to me the Pikachu lie the internet told me that the one screenshot that had the February 7th date was the date it was coming out they updated the wild area we won't let's start there okay we'll start with the Pokemon news this is all Pokemon calm February 7th face Giganta max talks tricity in pokemon sword in pokemon shield max raid battles a new Giganta max pokemon has been discovered and you will be able to encounter in pokemon sword and pokemon shield max raid battles the electric poison-type Giganta max toxicity will be appearing in dens from February 6 to March 8th the electric-type moves used by toxicity will change to G max stun shock which not only deals damage but also poisons or paralyzes all opponents you all may also know that there are two forms of toxicity amp'd form toxicity and Loki form toxicity when you are facing off against tax GMAC stocks tricity will encounter amp amp to form in pokemon sword and Loki form in pokemon shield if you challenge a gigantic stocks tricity in the form you cannot hello if you want to challenge G max toxicity in the form you can't encounter try joining a max rate battle hosted by some other version I wish they told you I have so many Loki forms and I keep jumping into other people's and arrows like Oh ever he's playing sword I keep running into amped form and I've zero amps form I caught one last night but I think it was an amped form yeah yeah I mean they really uh I think we talked about this before the game came out they're really taking advantage of both games here I mean as they should give us some value for having two different games oh that's true that's very that's that's true I mean it's nice that you don't need to have both games you just need to either jump into somebody's raid and or find a friend who it doesn't have the same copy as you we talked about military being promoted right yep we talked last week about how the star and the WoW is my memory emitted ribbons sweets are now available which they weren't previously yes I caught 59 of them I was gonna say 60 but I was using Silve allied to battle them which is taking up one battle spot one box spot I caught 59 of them two too many I never want to catch another one again I have a lot I don't know that I have all the farms but I don't want all the form specific some of the forms don't look good it's all or nothing Greg nope it is in the middle or nothing you have to get them all shiny I haven't seen a shiny one yeah but you don't want to catch them a shiny catching 50 of them doesn't suddenly turn on me so are we gonna do you guys want to talk about how tax tricity is actually the pokemon on the side of the hill is it yeah yeah pokemon at the lighthouse it is the pokemon of the lighthouse yeah cuz the lighthouse has two statues of tax tricity oh yeah yeah but when you first arrive into my lowest town I can't remember what it's called probably first no no what chirst is the first time with the transition yeah mulberry is where nessa is hammerlock is obviously in the middle wind ins no no wind ins final city motor stock also city in middle anyways the city with the the pump caboose and the the rocks and the whoo lose and the mile oh wow and the stone henges and the stoner cut out cardboard cut-out you know when you see the giant hill and that's kind of when you start hearing about the darkest day for the first time you see a Pokemon and that Pokemon is specifically GMAC stalks tricity it's got its tail yeah it has the tail dialer is that like what is that that was so confusing to me it's turf field turf field yeah it's its tail guitar yeah you can so it's so specifically they're sort of things that system well toxicity plays notes with his chest yeah so the eye is exactly the same the spikes down the back and then the tail are the three giveaways I don't know what the little things around toxicities feet are on the hill people getting wrecked I think it's supposed to be just the heat like people yes somebody was like alright smelt and I was like no Milton has one I not - I don't think specifically its it smelt an but like all Pokemon games they do a really bad job at fleshing out a full story and I'm sure the anime will answer these questions probably because let me tell you ultra subtle well let get all games have this but I'll just an ultra moon really bad at telling you all of alternate Crossley's desires and issues and the anime does a pretty okay job summing that up and you're like boy and you have to leave something for the anime yeah that's true I guess oh boy sword and shield has left a lot for the anime they entire ending yes exactly yep hey will you beat sword shield I mean I haven't finished the postgame back up to the credits yes I have I defeated the undefeatable champion story aside what do you think of that fight the battle with Leon yeah uh it was it was it was tough it was it was a pretty good battle I mean I still beat him in one try but yeah I mean you kinda kind of went in knowing that the thing I was really gonna have to contend it with was a big old Charizard so I had a plan for that game so the other dudes were a little bit of fluff that I had to work my way through I think what was the one that gave me the the most difficulty well you opens with aegislash and then he has a Haxorus and he might depending on the version you have he might have seismitoad oh you know what Haxorus was tough for me because it it use Iron Tail on Myra bomby and I was just like wasn't expecting that and I thought ro Bobby was gonna 1-shot it and it well it didn't the music's really good I think that whole fight is one of the most memorable memorable fights in all the Pokemon I mean I don't think I'll remember it um except for it okay here's here's what I really liked about stadium battles and honestly if I could have a lot more Stadium battles in this game I would be thrilled like if there was some way I could just like keep doing stadium battles I believe the competitive sure that when year you faint your opponent's Pokemon the ball guy image in the background does a little faint yeah graphic and then when they Giganta max the ball guy image in the background like gets all big I thought that was fantastic I love that ball guy best guy he could be either male or female that's what his league card said that's true that's very true don't know who who ball guy is under that suit did you have any thoughts about the fight with oleanna just it was it was it funny that like that she has all these like beauty Pokemon and then at the end because I guess she just wanted to win well the girl I don't know if you you I'll wait till you get to her other Li card there's a reason she has the car Broder wait Oh Deanna has a league card why would she have kalique cards every Lenny has ally carda heavily card it might not be her only card it might be chairman roses secondly card which she writes chairman roses Li card which I might have like story about her in it for anyone who doesn't want the spoiler if you beat the game go to the gallery mine's one after you beat Leon and you will find Oleanna and another Li card there I'm just chasing after some weirdos is what I'm doing right now oh the best so many questions I ask you well now that you've been the game how did you feel about the eternities fight I I don't understand okay first Leon says I got this needed all tired out that's where I was a Pokeball doesn't capture and okay so since when did a Pokemon escaping from a pokeball become so violent that the Charizard had to spin around and protect me and my buddy from the explosive action of okay so that was number one Charizard real hero of the game then say of the Wu he saves you who saves hop that's just because Leon did not understand what he was doing did just thought it was a simple easy fight and completely misjudged the situation still I have never had failed to catch a Pokemon in a pokeball and then been gruesomely more mutilated by the explosive power of the Pokemon popping back out of the pokeball that's not yeah it's not how the pokeballs are designed so then number two you don't know that you die you've never thrown 200 pokeballs at a mall trace on the top of the Sevi island you don't know how many of those were shattered in your face I have thrown quite a few pokeballs in my life thank you so then I fight eternities and I defeated it cept it's not to feed it I mean I knocked it out it's the same as in across ma it's literally the same fight you fight regular you fight in the Cosmo who took over so so gaily early Nala and then you got a chase through a wormhole fight it again this time at the begging yeah but that's runaway this one was like it was on the ground like I got you bud but then it turns into some weird spinning snake hand that thing that's the best part of that whole fight gigantic oh the gigantic max version of it but it doesn't it can't Dynomax so not yet yeah I can I chairman Rose has been feeling feeling at candy's for like twenty thousand years I thought the eternities couldn't Dynomax they can't once you caught it and Giganta maxes well okay whatever what is it supposed to represent the darkest day but but no outside of that it's it's like a Hydra wha okay okay so it's you're there it's got the spin ease and it's got this weird hand thing which is like why don't you just grab me and crush me because that'd save us all a whole lot of time mr. weird dragon head hand thing does that it doesn't crush you because the the wolves show up well they got knocked out pretty early in that battle so there's a lot in that battle too yeah that's very true oh yeah it turned to this took those dudes out really [ __ ] they were in the fight by entire time mm-hmm especially zosky n got went real quick so some superhero you were buddy during that battle you see flashes of like images from all around Galler yeah because why what what was that from they don't explain a lot I mean they sort of explain my game would night I mean the little that they do try to explain which you sort of have to really work hard to piece together is it's showing you the places that it's connected it was connected to or still is connected to because those are the places that ever that are hotspots for Dinah maxing so you're supposed to be seeing those spots in those areas why they're showing up no clue doesn't bother to explain it to you why it is bothering to show you that no clue doesn't bother to explain it to it's just that hey because of its impact after the darkest day all these places could Dynomax because of reasons it was the reason that those places got infected powered up don't it's like the all the wishing stars which are pieces of eternities or something but the other there's just so many questions this is it the main thing is I have never and this is a thing I frequently go back to but never so much as at the end of this game have I thought to myself it must make sense in Japanese and they just couldn't translate yeah like this X&Y has a significantly worse story X&Y has a worse story but x and y's story is laid out in a way that makes sense and it's thorough you know exactly why they're doing what they're doing and whether what they're doing makes sense or should be done no but you know it's like they want to accomplish this so these are the steps that they are taking to accomplish this literally in this game it's and and I know that you feel it's like oh the adults were keeping it from the children but still it's like if I was reading a novel and I got to the last five pages of the novel it's like here's the real story that you weren't reading about because we were keeping it from you got my money back friend but the chairman Rose was this dude hanging out in boo shorts at the seafood restaurant and then all of a sudden he's very impatient about bringing about the end of the world wide circle and that's like a standard trope though of what no there's just no there's no explanation behind it like like if they even had said we've been using eternity as the power source for Galler and if we don't let him go he's gonna run out of steam and we've got to rejuvenate and but they never even said that much he does say that there does say that he does say the first time you get to hammer lock hammer lock that they have an energy problem and they need to solve it soon and the energy problem is a turnit as' but although he does say that but what I'm gonna argue that soon meaning we're gonna run out of power in a thousand years yeah that's a wild way to say soon like the thing that's lacking is his motivation to do it now yeah like hand in a very like now unstructured uh I mean you can you can project a lot on to it but that's all projection it's not coming from the actual narrative of the of the tale it's just it's so unsatisfying like even if they had said if chairman Rose had said I provoked this to happen because I want Leon to capture eternities you know so that we can you know rethink the energy structure of galleries say that one phrase but never is that said we're just assuming that he provoked this to happen and and maybe it had to happen before the championship battle cuz he knew Leon was gonna lose and then he was like I don't want you to have a turn it is yeah but Leon would have been easier to manipulate after he lost and was feeling bad about himself well except that he wouldn't run to save the gallery cuz he's not the champion anymore so he's like that's not my champion duty dude you're the winner go good luck I would there's a lot about what chairman Rose and why his time frame is the time frame that they just don't say like I absolutely agree that chairman roses entire reason for doing what he does is left just - speculative it's just like well why like like why we know Lysander is a nutjob who either wants to kill all people or kill all pokemons depending on which game you're playing and the way that he's going to do it is to reignite the three thousand-year-old weapon right we know that because it they make that very clear in the game that's like that's like start and stop the entire thing that Leo Lysander provides that dude has still rode depth getting getting more Ben I got from sword and shield I don't know I would like like I I'm not gonna say that the ending or the I think the ending is fine in sword and shield I think my I've already voiced all those complaints about how they could have said one or two things to clear up chairman rose but chairman roses more interesting from start to finish as a character and I would rather be left with more questions and wanting to see more which I'm sure the expansion will do on that than to be like I know nothing about Lysander and I don't I have no questions about Lysander he's just a rich dude that wears a red suit that wants to blow up the world like he's so he's such a boring character we didn't know nothing about Lysander we knew a lot about him the entire game like constantly yes you never get any of the text bubbles and why he was like they explained my Sanders character you can decide that it's boring because it is a terrible trope but Rose is also a terrible trope that they don't bother explaining I mean Rose has more roses only more interesting because of Oleanna and you know it also kind of also puts a emphasis on this is I have gotten more out of the two weirdos and their motivation then I got about any of roses motivation throughout the entire get is also true yeah the minimum cutscene it's like you know and it's like you were saying like why why did they put up the mural in front of the carving that's in the mountainside right that got destroyed by the Kaaba Raja or whatever and they make that very clear it's like their family put that up to hide what actually happened right right and it's like oh but I know all this just from a few lines of dialog that they put why couldn't they have done the same in like taking us to you a seafood restaurant and having a sit there and having a seat that's just I just feel like like they they cut something out and they didn't need to I don't and you know also this really really underscores is I found that the arcs in the story about like Sonja and bead and Marnie and piers and like all the different human relationships that weren't the the Grand Opera part of the story to be so much more interesting and fun to be part of they are Tori is the best story and it's like you know what take this as your lesson learned Pokemon make the next game just a slice of life anime right we don't need any grant disaster just make it like boy today for a year for almost 10 years I mean I disagree but because I don't need a game where I'm saving the world I don't need that in like that's let me just try it just try it you know you two are always willing to try new stuff try this the new stuff worth it I mean this was really their opportunity to do it because the whole structure of the the gym challenge it's so nice and refreshing and it's just like would integrate so well of like here's the four or five six of us on our journey and it's like how do our different human relationships impact how we do on the journey and learn and grow over time I guess so that that part of it is so good and it's so just like left on the side I mean this was the game where they didn't actually have well they they still had like a bad team but there's no like bad team moment I guess I guess there's that kind of is the only item I was like yeah yeah I wasn't but like that has an old key when they sit basically say hey all these corporations are working against you take that corporate sponsors so that's it I'll continue playing I'll play shield eventually well post expansion Vesta can have your perfect team I don't know if I can wait that long it's only June I know but it's like well I I'm gonna have animal crossing just wait for my critiques of animal crossing and how crummy that store sure there is no story I mean I guess the basic story of the real story that is life like the most boring yeah it's the story of life called a mortgage and a raccoon it's not gonna let you'd be until you pay off that mortgage I'll pull weeds IRL but I'll pull weeds and Animal Crossing I just I don't think I can bring myself to play that game animal crossing yeah Greg yeah I played the other ones so what's the issue this the issue that I have with all of them is that I play them for about a week and then they really begin to resent the game or making me like I can't take a break I have to be there every day people like the things that I want reg life doesn't stop yeah but I can take breaks from life I can I can take breaks I don't fall apart here's the secret you find people who are super Animal Crossing fanatics and they exist out there and then you're like hey dude I'm gonna leave my train station open all day so could you just come over and pick all my weeds for me and lay down some paths and and I have pretty up the place maybe replant some of these trees in the right area so we have groves and these people will be like well I already did all that in my town so yeah I'll just come over - no no you got a I'm not gonna name names but there's a certain person who lives in Canada near Ottawa that I'm sure is enough of a fanatic because they literally reset their own town so that they can keep doing this stuff over and over again I'm sure they're gonna be real happy to just have access to other people's towns like put those things here oh man you got to give up some control no and then just enjoy the experience why by playing the game so that when pavé shows up you can do his little paw favoritos game the worst part about it is I'm gonna be peer pressured into playing Animal Crossing like his peer pressured into playing magic and you love playing magic now I love parts I will say the last animal crossing there was a lake there I I do agree with Greg there was like a social because when wild world came out there was no Twitter at the time maybe they're no they're definitely no there wasn't and then I bought and played the we won but I didn't love it so I only played it for like two days um oh I played the we won the most and then when I had everything in that game new leaf came out I felt like this social pressure of like everyone playing a lot and I wasn't being able to keep like I wasn't keeping up fast enough and then like people would be like oh I got the lighthouse or I got the police station or I got the cafe and it's like I don't have those but they're all orangey you can't you can only do so much to like hopefully get those public work projects to appear so it's like I'm so far behind that person has a cafe that person has like four four fossils completely done and I keep getting this Triceratops booty well and then my favorite animals leave not if you treat them right yeah oh I want mmm I have I have I have spent a ton of time on very specific creatures giving them everything they want doing everything and they're like I'm thinking of leaving and then I'll say like no please don't and they're like oh you're too attached to me me leaving would be good for ya I will say that for this town because my last town literally has what the final message I left for my town was this is now yours don't mess it up I'm gonna go play a fun game it's called Pokemon and then he's perfectly tacked to the to the building Lord of my last out maybe your animals have shared the same personality traits with Chairman rose where they do have a good reason but they just need to leave right now I just have to leave Gregg this is for the best I want that come the ones that come back are awful the ones that move in are like the worst it's not crappy some crabby bunny who's just like ruining the my good works well I have to you have to work to change its attitude by being friendly to it and giving it nice things I'm all right Crossing town we set up a giant flower cannon we face it toward the sky yes and if you leave I'm set it off I will I will say I'm when I start this new Animal Crossing I will do it on my own without anybody else around because I think that was a huge mistake starting the last one because there was just too much conflict over who gets what face and what town layout was the good way out first the bow you weren't there but I don't think I was very either you were and it was even worse because I like had to double by an ace oh don't you there's a quiz and then you show out you get a different face the different is the quiz and the new one I think you just design your characters face that's fine I still don't want to any be around anybody who's gonna say well I wanted that face like I want the face you have probably not not discuss it's discussed about social media and just like play the game on my own and you know ask my expert friends for advice when I need advice but yeah that whole like other people are getting things before you get things it's like it is so strangely disincentivizing to actually play the game and it's like I know that there are things that I greatly value an animal crossing' like getting all the songs and it's like when you find out well somebody else already got all the songs and you missed one week because you're out camping in the northern woods and now you have to wait a whole year until that song but pave furniture just to have a room full of pave furniture is worth the effort in the struggle we need to make real pave furniture in the real world and then you don't have to worry about it oh no too ugly to have an actual house not only good for virtual homes I don't know what pave furniture is we're gonna take a break though I'm a modern furniture kind of guy clean clean lines where are my surfaces that's right all right we'll be right back and they also show a new Pokemon called I don't know how to pronounce this so you asked the correct me john-boy [Music] it seems like just like nog and L not [Music] gaana del I can die second dogs 9 to 5 toys were cannot so what are the toys doing after 5 p.m. look I didn't name their time I even name the website I've seen Toy Story though so I would imagine the toys get up they walk around the Hangout this is from James in our addict Channel Funko pop unveils for count'em for new Pokemon figures are you excited will are you gonna fall ready for the next news article pop your house you know these four figures or this is breaking news for you it's breaking news for me but because I just completely do not understand the point of Funko pops right like I understand action figures and like transformers which I used to love to have when I was younger be the robot close guys yes and they I could set them up and I'm like oh we're having a battle or I could transform them and it's like you're an airplane now or you're a cassette recorder Funko pops just sit there and stare at you you don't get to play with them and they're like plushies they also just sit there they don't transform I play that you notice I also don't have a lot of stuffed animals but but also stuffed animals you can hug or you can put on your well-made bed and you know amongst the pillows as decoration but just a Funko and the other thing that's horrible about Funko pops is it's like if you take them out of the box you've done it wrong yeah like who wants okay just that depending on their level of design once you take them out of the box they may not be able to stay that's sure but but no it's but it's just like I don't I don't understand it's like if I want sculpture I'll go to Greece right I'm not buying mr. Franco's things I mean I have some fun I'm my java so I have a couple Funko's so I have a I have Pokemon Funko's that I've purchased myself as their Pokemon a lot of the non Pokemon Funko's I have were given as gifts which I would argue it a lot of Funko's are probably like the good gift right not in this house brother or sister needs to get other brother or sister gift and we're both 30 years old and we don't know what to get each other but I know my brother really likes Star Wars here's the Han Solo pop figure that I just saw at Target I know you like Star Wars hope you don't have this one you probably don't cuz there's probably 40 different Han Solo pops I'm assuming by package then your old brother just wanted cash probably true I was after after 30 pretty much people just want cash you have to give Funko Credit in in making probably a product with little to no with with high probability you tilla t high profit but they sell it at such a good price that it's that's it's it's hitting that impulse zone for a lot of people what do these things go for they're usually like eleven dollars usually $10.99 to like $12.99 so they're like cheap at impulse price level you are correct they're cheap enough to be like oh man I love the Golden Girls and they have my favorite one Hillary I'm gonna buy that I mean we're not allowed to talk about this but I will say that we do have all four Golden Girls Funko pops and Hillary is not one of them so we're gonna move on I know Betty White is a golden girl bad enough her name is actually Betty White in the show it is no not oh it is not okay pick a different series Harry Potter Harry Potter I wanted pop fitting no one says Hagrid's their favorite pop figure somebody does if somebody likes spin does somebody likes Hagrid yeah maybe so I have speaking so I have all the day with Pikachu Funko pops which are made by funko but they're not pop figures they're the ones with like Pikachu being scared by the Diglett or Pikachu having a snowman they're like actually toys is it Funko just a front for game stop no I don't think that bones Funko I think of anything Funko probably has more money than games up probably some secret chairman rows cabal going on I mean they're Funko holdings LLC but that doesn't anything yeah I'm sure Disney will eventually buy them or something of the sort okay so the four new Funko's are Vulpix regular can Tony invokes mr. mime Pichu and mu to the Mewtwo and the mr. mime look okay I really like all four of these actually I think the Pichu looks really great too yeah sometimes sometimes these figures benefit from these eyes so they definitely don't I think the best looking Pokemon prior to these four was the Bulbasaur I think the mobile sort of looked really good Charmander did not look great though I've been told I have I know a couple very uh in in in very thorough Funko pop collectors they were probably I would imagine they're on the Funko forums they're hitting up the Funko reddit I probably have a Boram is a hundred percent I've never checked it but I'm gonna say yes oh there's a reddit for everything I'm sure they have a secret Funko Twitter where they do swap trades mystery gifting each other Funko's they told me though that in in the skews of unreleased Funko's there's a mu 2 GD Funko listed which is glow-in-the-dark mu 2 hmm I am now on Funko pop reddit just to say how my day is going yeah it's also still snowing so that's telling you a lie yeah I don't know if there's much news here besides they're making more Funko I mean out of all 890 Pokemon they're doing mr. mime so it's it's actually pretty incredible how one movie turned mr. mime into this marketing machine that clearly they people want mr. mime now I guess I mean if that's a prising Salt girl Funko pop I don't know what that means what is this oh it is like the salt girl from like these salts yes from the salt like the salt from the salt from Maureen not to be confused with reddit for a but from the salt you buy and put on food yo who's buying this fine apparently the other is this person's favorite that I found on reddit who's what the battle lemons loves Morton Salt girl according to Reddit and it's their new instant favorite and I'm just I'm just blown away and the fact that people are complaining that they can't find one anywhere in their town I don't well I don't want to live in this world right we need a stop right now we're we are two steps away from us trying to find more consult girl in our towns we are what happened my target cuz I'm already looking and then as soon as we vibe more in salt girl we're gonna be like no one has this we have a rare Funko pop now we need other rare Funko puffs well it's on pre-order in Amazon and Amazon says it won't be released until March 13 2020 so somebody has insider trading maybe all we're cracking the Funko worldwide open we don't know move on I was gonna I had more to say about we're moving on Greg we can't don't tell me any more fun cuz this is how it starts this is how they get sucked in and all of a sudden you've got a wall full of Funko pops and just opposite your wall full of what are those little Nintendo dollies that you put he bows amiibos oh just no well just just take a look at what I just sent you and then we'll move on because I can't there's an icy polar bear Funko you blowing my mind battle in the 2020 international challenge in February this is another Pokemon Day thing it will start gosh I'm gonna be a pax over this weekend yeah we're happy you have the right plane dates hey i double-checked greg double-checked for me i also learned that this airplane cast here I have learned from booking the wrong dates which I have okay I am sure somebody listening to this podcast has also booked wrong flights I'm sure more I'm so confident that I'm I could I could probably guess that two people have booked our flight so I'm not the only person in the world that has ever picked the wrong month but the right days yes but I've learned that even if you booked non-refundable tickets that you have 24 hours to still cancel oh yeah yes definitely and that that was a huge thing to me cuz even if I was like oh man no one's awake at 4:00 a.m. to double-check these dates or prices I could book it wake up at like 2 p.m. the next day and be like oh I still have 12 more hours before I need to verify that these are in fact the right dates so pro tip if you booked flight tickets you have 24 hours to cancel no matter what can I give a super life hack yes gonna save people money alright so let's say you booked a hotel and they basically say you have up until 24 hours to cancel this reservation otherwise we're gonna charge you for the reservation right you've done that with the hotel before right yeah and then it gets to be within 24 hours and you find out like you're not gonna take that trip because I'm your flight got cancelled or something like that right the disaster you're gonna lose money right this is what you do this is the will anderson method you call the hotel and you say I have a reservation for tomorrow but my plans got changed and I need to move the reservation a week and they're like oh well fine well move your reservation you know no extra charge this like because you're not canceling your moving your reservation and then after they've confirmed the reservation has been moved a week be polite hang-up call back into customer service and say what my reservation is a week from now so I need to cancel it and then they don't charge the cleanest pool that is dirty dirty pool you are relying on people in customer service not reading the notes I mean if they took notes yeah dang this is this is my job this is why I yell at my reps take notes some would argue that's like 5d chess right there Wow that's night my one 5d chess play I've ever made in my life yes dimension the fifth dimension is saving money space saving money challenge traders around the world in the 2020 international challenge in February this is the first international challenge using sword and shield top competitors can earn championship championship points towards an invitation invitation to pokemon world championships before you begin you have to link your Nintendo account to your pokemon trainer club account to ensure that champion points are awarded correctly this is the first time I'm pretty sure they're giving actual points in an online competition my wrong I think they've done that before they've done that before Oh cuz the GTS could write because the GTS saw or they're not the GTS the pgl the Global Link was already connected to your trainer club account your trainer ID yeah okay I was like I feel like they've given points before but also I don't remember them asking me to connect an account but now this makes sense got it you can sign up anytime between February 19th to the February 27th to make this very clear this happens every single tournament where people go oh there's a tournament how do I sign up know it already started you can't sign up as soon as it opens as soon as you remember if you're listening to this podcast or if somebody says anything in slack or on Twitter sigh this costs nothing to sign up you just go to the vs. you go to competitions you go to sign up you do not I think a lot of people don't sign up because they think they need a team ready you don't need a team ready you just enroll into the competition and then you can't even submit your team yet once the once the competition opens up on February 27th then it will ask you for your team so you can't sign up yet right it doesn't know it right start until the 19th it doesn't start off 19th but not when you're listening to this now well let's go into this 10 days from now or if it's 2021 you missed it you correct but keep that in mind just whenever these competitions open just sign up you don't there's no this not gonna force you to do anything it's not gonna lock Pokemon it's not gonna ask for Pokemon it's just at it's just because once it starts you can't you can't sign up once you're out you're locked out and you want to sign up for this you want to sign up for this because Eve all you have to do is one match win or lose you could bring in ask woven a rickety and a Pikachu and as long as you do one match you will get an in-game trainer clothing casualty featuring the pokeball guy so you get a shirt in the game I somebody out there set your alarm to remind me to do this because I need that T hi when I was at PAX South I don't think I mentioned this there was somebody cosplaying as pokeball guy and it was amazing that is actually pretty cool and they were they bid they didn't even walk around packed South they just stood they just did against a while yes date did you go did you approach that they gave you a polka ball I was too scared to approach classic okay wet Wednesday February 19th until Thursday February 27th you launch your game you go to the verse menu select battle stadium you select online competitions and then you select search for online competition to register you can earn up top competitors can earn up to 50 championship points but you have to link your Nintendo account to your my trainer account in order to do so it is double battle format four to six Pokemon all Pokemon will be level 40 and 50 in battle you have 4 pokemon eligible pokemon or pokemon in the gallery x1 through 397 which is no za Shion no zama Zenta no Esther notice there are select Giganta max Pokemon you can use pretty much the Giganta max Pokemon that are legal outside of this competition which is Charizard Butterfree Pikachu Meowth Eevee Snorlax korbinite dreadnoughts and Akana and CentOS scorch only pokemon that are caught or hatched from eggs or received as mystery gifts and sword and shield are eligible and you are allowed 15 battles a day 45 battles total I believe they do roll over um so if you missed the first two days you could do 45 bottles on the last day but you're limited to 45 battles I believe because it's three days hmm speaking of the battle format they have so they they didn't allow any Giganta max Pokemon in season one and then in season two they allowed the ones I just listed here and I know Greg and I had an argument about how that was too fast in like allowing new Pokemon to be used season three they're not all season three started they did not allow any new Pokemon so there I guess taking another month so instead of adding more Giganta max Pokemon which was my argument back then Greg was just because they're adding expansion Pokemon doesn't mean they're gonna be legal for competition right away I don't know when what was promoted last time Oh flap al and Al creamy and oh yeah colossal and Lapras would I would imagine that those will probably be ready for season four which would be what March first I think sure I don't know or or not I don't I don't know I don't know if they I don't know what their their plan is competitive wise but I do like I do like these seasons I do like the season stuff I do like you know the thing resets every month which I mean a lot of games do a lot of games your stats reset every month and you climb the ladder and you do the things and it is what it is more Pokemon Day 2020 you can vote for the most popular pokemon in each region and you can do it every day do it every day have been I haven't been but I'm not registered to vote so I need to get on that I think the deadline is February 11th to participate search for a Pokemon vote on Google but this is like a really weird way to do it but okay it's it's not great but yes they they're using Google's logo here in the press release so I'm assuming there's some sort of partnership the vote screen will be displayed on your search results select the category you want to vote from the eight choices select one pokemon from the list sorted by national dex number and click the vote button when you're signed in to the Google account you can cast one vote per category for maximum eight votes daily you can vote once in each category but you can vote each day during but you vote each day during the voting period votes will be counted based on the pokemons national dex even if the Pokemon has multiple forms including regional forums so for example if you wanted to cert if you wanted to vote for gallery' and Ponyta you just have to vote for Ponyta same from Vulpix I can we talk about the controversy around this capsule it's the controversy Melton is listed in the Galler list and not the a low-low list and it's listed as extra yeah so it's Kanto Johto ho and sin oh you know uh also do you guys get this on yours when it when it pulls up you Nova it says like you know the journalists you nema like is that actually you know like is it not you know in every language I'm assuming it must not because why else would they do that yeah I mean it yeah it did strike me as weird and I'm like what what okay cuz it's the only one that does that Kalos a Lola Galler etc let's go Pikachu let's go v is a Gen seven game in the sense that instantly it is different names in different language I guess it's using the gem seven wild in Jen Melton appeared in Pokemon let's go for Pokemon go first so there's another thing that happened there's a there's a video there's a video of like all the Pokemon they show each generation they show like Kalos they show Kanto in the order and stuff and then each when they like say Kanto it has all 151 Pokemon in it and then when they say Johto it has all 100 Pokemon on it and so they do that there's not an English video of it but it's on the Japanese Pokemon YouTube I think there's a Korean one too but it's it's just to get you hyped for Pokemon Day but in that video Melton and Mel metal are both listed among the gen8 Pokemon okay I I saw some discussion of this on Twitter and I immediately thought what does it matter you're right it doesn't matter so much but clearly do in the sense I guess it matters in the sense that like Game Freak and the Pokemon company know their Pokemon better than us ideally you would hope I guess you would think and I don't and I don't think some intern made this video or some intern worked on not saying all interns are incompetent yeah but I'm not like if you were to if you were to like look at the video like Mel Mel medal is behind like preser Kerr and hatena and and Grimm snarl and Melton is like right next to Bolton it's not like it's like these were placed in a way so everyone's face is showing so it's not like oh we don't know where Melton is going I guess we forgot to put it in the ole Ola let's try to squeeze them in together it's like no they somebody placed them here because that's where it's supposed to be my assumption for the etc is the only reason they have that is because somebody could argue well if Melton is gen8 why can't I get it in gen8 yet that would probably be the reason that they have the except for their I mean sure it's just it's weird that they did it that way just make another category because you're limiting that choice like it's Gellar and leftovers well the only leftover is melt mmm oh right yeah there's no other Pokemon sneaking into this trailer we have - coming - coming I count the calories Oh Cal Rex Oh shushing we he'll they're here they could have put them in there and they didn't and the arguments of like oh well it appeared in a gen 7 game so it has to be a gen 7 Pokemon like that's look munchlax was in those bad GameCube games before Diamond and Pearl came out Munchlax was also in Pokemon - before Diamond Pro came out Togepi was in the gen 1 anime before the gen 2 anime what was it Pichu was in the Pikachu short of the first Pokemon movie before they even got to a gen 2 Pokemon movie I mean they've just this is not a like a weird thing where they've introduced different generations of Pokemon the early besides all that I can't wait for everyone to be mad when Charizard wins Kanto oh absolutely if you're not voting Terra's art for Kanto you're not doing it right I was gonna go for oddish I mean I'm voting for Cuba but see this is a problem we have to work together we have to band together as a community and I'll vote for the same Pokemon otherwise farce otherwise you Charizard is going to win no we have to pick a Pokemon that at least has the likelihood to win Greg maybe it's not voting we can serves to win we can't vote third party here yes we got we have let me have a look suck it up and accept a joto is full of hot garbage except for Dunsparce and that's Naruto has qwilfish you know and it is the leader hot guard of the year of qwilfish no it's the year of Dunsparce now vote done sports boat Dunsparce boat den sports both done sports all right who's winning Hoenn Sableye ah yeah save lies gotta win Hoenn I feel like a bunch of legendaries they're gonna wait okay they absolutely are but but see I kids have a short attention span these days so it's up to us adults to vote every day cuz we can put we have tasks calendars we have phone reminders I wish it was only vote once because I am I like if you tell me I can vote every day I'm I'm out you've been voting every day done spark you've asked for too much first you think Piplup wins four okay you know people you people you people we're just telling me about every day is fine for animal crossing but you can't vote every day for the best Pope okay it's hard you know what every day because like you are on your computer more than you are an animal crossing okay I would it's because it's hard to vote for something that you know is going to lose but if you vote every day it's not gonna lose because you have the tenacity to make it happen look a 100 I know how democracy works it's all rigged no you don't you would to Milwaukee Public Schools you have the bare minimum your knowledge of democracy only goes as far as the Civil War it's very true yes a Abraham Lincoln in the Civil War is all you do that's all the bother to cover but those of us who vote every day well out do the 100 children who got access to mom and dad's Google account for two seconds to vote once we can turn the tide okay vote once vote often is my motto isn't it which way it shouldn't be vote once it should be vote vote vote daily vote often well vote once he's healing about once in each category yeah sure okay do it a lot so out of the gen8 pokemon what do you think is the one that could possibly win oh yeah / yeah I keep calling for Bolton but I think I would I would either argue that three P since I haven't seen a tree P and if I haven't seen a DP then probably most people haven't seen a tree P no I'm actually I actually do think 3p horses or Sonam have like the highest if it's a droopy do wondered race because people have been breeding that and sending out the rejects for months now I have so many droopy that I have throw it away from other people I have at least five different foreign 3 P if I ever wanna breed a shiny yeah I have a tree P coming out of my ears yeah 3 P is the one or trade pokémon I'm gonna say that score bunny has ash as a shot I think so too I definitely think Square money out of all the starters have a shot I wouldn't argue that should win but it won't how's the thing that's in race has a shot over all the other starters as well well it's the line right so the line is gonna win that's what their big thing is is if you vote for anything in the line that line wins mmm if all the like chain wallet where's come out and vote for tax tricity I could maybe see that it like you back in the day I get I gave that up I do think though that's Nam has probably one of the height as a shot avoid I do love Sam I'm torn between voting first now I'm and voting for Bolton but I made my choice I'm eight I went with my polka my masters pair I go Bolton you know it's not winning all of the art all of the fossils they have no shot yeah I don't think so speaking of Pokemon masters this is off silicon arrow Pokemon masters Professor Oak trailer teases his debut I'm gonna be full disclosure here I am a partner I'm partnered with DNA to help promote Pokemon masters I want to be very careful about an ounce Deana yeah I don't know there's an e in there though it should be Deana I'll add I'll ask them next time okay okay so I'm gonna cautiously dance around this because there's a lot of rumors out there and there are animal Greg can spec use anything Greg says does not reflect me of my partnership but I'll read it and then I'll so I'll shut up and then Greg can Greg can put their input of what they think the rumor is when February first began Pokemon masters oak appearance was teased now his upcoming role in the game has been confirmed with a trailer rather showing uh rather rather than showing the sync pair in game it's a live action video confirming Professor Oak is on the way so right now there's a Japanese video up I'm assuming that we're gonna get an American video probably by the time this episode goes up but if you haven't seen it it's on the official Japanese Pokemon a YouTube page which that I am allowed to talk about as long as it's officially on dnase twitter or an official Pokemon source that's fair game for me so the Pokemon masters oak sync pair is going to be a free one On February 14th they'll be doled out to users his partner is not confirmed we know about Professor Oak obviously I've watched the trailer multiple times there are rumors of what people think Professor Oak's pokémon is going to be this article here says again this is the article talking at me it could be Bulbasaur Charmander squirtle because technically they're not in the game yet but I will now pass it over to Greg and I'm washing my hands free of what Greg is rumors ah so I saw upon the reddit's because of Steve's influence I know unfortunately sometimes have to go to reddit that people are claiming that there is a shadow of a specific mythical Pokemon related to Mewtwo and they say the shadow is clearly there and I have stared at this photo oh geez for hours and I have no idea what they're talking about however that has not stopped everybody in the world saying they have seen Mew in the shadow and Professor Oak's partner will be mu I I don't know what they're seeing it sure it could be it I it could also be any of the surges except for Charizard because we know red is getting Charizard specifically probably Charizard X yeah I don't know I have gone back and looked and looked and looked I don't see it all of you are free to go stare at this picture as much as I have I have old eyes perhaps young eyes will see the shadow that I do not see but the big rumor right now is professor oak and mu because of this fuzzy shadow trailer is cool like Isaac Tyler is really really cool I was really really impressed with it yeah the trailer is very cool and I don't there's a lot in this trailer like there's a lot of things that point to a lot of things I don't they go past his they go past his table that has all the starters on it so it could just be that but like even in the trailer I'm staring I am staring at this pillar that's supposed to have the shadow on it don't see it don't I don't see it ah well either way uh this comes out in a couple days yeah it'll be here soon ah you know out of all sink Perry I'm still I'm still I've given DNA my feedback I said I want gen8 trainers in Jenny Pokemon but I am I never thought that they would actually do professor oak so the fact that just professor oak is coming I think is really exciting like I think that is a cool sink pair just in general that like oh cool finally in a Pokemon game we can have Professor Oak and they're going to have some sort of Pokemon that's cool and I'm sure he'll probably do like I'm sure there'll be the little voice sample thing which is my favorite mystery yeah the welcome Wow Wow good nice job job I mean Professor Oak already is in the game as Professor Oak strike persona agatha with Gengar so gasps this is this is his alternate form look at the pictures and tell me I'm wrong I'm predict is it the actual lore like they they were rivals like they went on a Pokemon journey together I'm pretty sure that's the actual lore of those two sure that's what they they knew each other but it's just obviously that is the classic Pokemon cut and paste right there it's just like that and paste the character model put a wig on it we're done it is it is cool that when they sent out that newsletter I don't know if you guys get the Pokemon newsletters oh I do oh I think oh I do we'll probably well are you I feel like wills the person that has like 800 unread emails I've got 26,000 done ready there we go that's what I thought when I get the Pokemon newsletter I do look at it and then delete it right quit II pretty rapidly okay perfect so that was sent on February 5th it starts off with the Google Year Pokemon and then it says Pokemon Day so they have they have sort and shield Pokemon go Pokemon Center and they actually have Pokemon masters so that's actually kind of cool to see whether or not you like Pokemon go or you like Pokemon masters or you like buying plushies from the Pokemon set this was a complaint that I've had a year after year that they don't do enough for these days especially because they do they have done stuff for Pokemon go but like last year they could have just gave us a distribution and let's go they could have just been like here is a here's a Machop that has a ribbon on it and they didn't even do that I don't know if we're getting a distribution for sword and shield specifically on that day they have they did recently give a 20 battle point 20 battle point code at the start of season 3 which they've done every season of free 20 battle points they did as of when they released toxicity and GMAX raid they there's a code out there right now that gives you three TRS for host power horse power which is a ground type move toxicity is four times week to ground so stop using earthquake in raids because it hits everyone each you have three Pokemon to teach horse power the the the the big the big brain play here for toxicity is Toby tomorrow with lightning rod toga tomorrow is steel an electric can't get hurt by electric because the lightning rod can't get hurt by poison because it's steel type I teach it Zen headbutt which is super effective you're good to go toga tomorrow is the big big brain play I guess you could bring a mug's Dale but whatever's good with for you i I think toga tomorrow is pretty cute so anyways going back to the email I think it's cool that it seems like they're focusing on multiple things here this year so so I guess I'm excited um but they announced some stuff for Pokemon and go for Pokemon Day if if February didn't have a million Pokemon go events there's another fifty coming so we will cover that when we get back from our break [Music] also Logan's here Logan when was the last time you were on long time ago the problem very lonely why you always making people cry why why are you always making people cry cry [Music] Pokemon go celebrate Pokemon day 2020 with Pokemon go did you know Pokemon Day happens every year on February 27th I did know that did well not it didn't happen in 1992 that's true did you expect that on Pokemon go live.com which is the antics Pokemon go website that they say pokémon Mewtwo strikes back comes out on Netflix on February 27 and to commemorate the movie release armored Mewtwo will be returning a company with clone Pokemon seen in the movie but I already have an armored Mewtwo but how would you note that a Pokemon was cloned I can tell you it's just like a pokey hacks kind of thing no it's not bkx ok from tuesday from tuesday on february 25th to Monday March 2nd some Pokemon are here to party keep a lookout for Pikachu and Eevee wearing party hats then they were doing it from my birthday here in the wild Bulbasaur Charmander and squirtle will be supporting the same festive look but only hatching from 7k eggs there's a chance that these party Pokemon could be shiny duh don't sound so excited well I took the day off from my birthday so I will spend the entire day hunting for a shiny party hat Pokemon does that do that enough excitement for you yes yeah now you have to tell Papa Niantic how many incubators you plot you plan on buying 0 and how much walking you plan on doing a heck of a lot not only is armored Mewtwo in pokémon Mewtwo strikes back evolution it will be returning to raised with special charge attacks I strike remember clone Pokemon question mark no well some are coming to Pokemon go in celebration of Pokemon Day and the launch of pokémon Mewtwo strikes back evolution on Netflix special clone Pokemon including Venus or Charizard and Blastoise will appear in four star raids and if you use the go snapshot feature a clone Pikachu might appear in your photo and you will be able to catch it okay how do you know that a pokemons a clone Pokemon okay so they have they have like the like they have the football lines under their eyes they have like if you watch the movie you're tired yeah kinda if you did you're not watch Mewtwo strikes back I mean I there was a long time ago I don't remember the details of the animation yeah the clone Pokemon just had like marks on them to show that they were clone so these program like camouflage yes yes somebody took like a black stripe and put it across their head and then they like lowered the opacity and the black stripe so it blended in with their skin not a particularly good clone what want me to mate the clones what do you want from him he was just born three days ago it's like y'all were sitting in that warehouse trying to figure out how to get over here I had to do something then there will be some bonuses trainers will be able to do up to two special trades a day raid Pokemon there will be a raid day on Sunday March 1st there will be raids featuring new torino and Gengar wearing hats NIT arena wearing a hats the party hat the party hat ninh arena will be parent wearing party hats in two star raids Gengar will no lick and psychic and wear a party hat in four star raids if you're lucky you may encounter a shining in torino or shiny Gengar wearing a party hat you can receive up to five raid passes for free at no cost by spinning photo discs at gyms you cannot hold more than one of these at once they're not available when the event ends that will be Sunday March 1st from 2 to 5 p.m. local time now I want a party hat Gengar for my birthday and I believe according to Eurogamer when they talked to the antic knee antic did say that the party hat Pikachu uh sorry Pichu party how I think of all this but the party hat Charmander squirtle and Bulbasaur cannot evolve and the party hat Nidorino also cannot evolve and I do not think clone Pikachu can evolve but I don't remember that one for sure I get that people are tired of hats I understand I'm not tired of hatch I'd rather I have hatched in Chinese the big question is can these hat Pokemon be transferred outside of Pokemon go into Pokemon home when Pokemon home I can't even say when Pokemon home arrives because Pokemon go will not work with Pokemon home when it arrives I like hats because it's a another thing to collect so it gets me to go out I want the Pokemon with a hat I get it I am real tired of these 7k eggs they're doing its and like everything is restricted to eggs I feel like hey you want Wurmple with a party hat 7k egg hey you want you want Bulbasaur Charmander squirtle 7 CAG you want any of this like it's a sin Oh event but you want the shiny riolu that we're putting out 7 keg you want RM Darumaka 7 keg I mean I hatched a 7k egg everyday so sometimes too though what's the what's the worry you want I'm in 10k eggs no I just don't want them in eggs [Laughter] do not have I mean to be fair I do not have a 7k egg every day but - like trivialize something as I would love to walk around and find a Bulbasaur and a Charmander and a squirtle and have one of each but then to say like oh you need to walk 7k which is a lot I feel like for a person to get the Bulbasaur of the charmer in the squirtle in a party hat which I will literally do nothing with except say I have a Charmander and I squirt it Charmander Bulbasaur squirtle in a party hat in my image or a funk ocean of the Pokemon world you're saying the photos of the Pokemon world but I have to leave that to random chance and what's going to happen is I'm gonna hatch like 414 Bulbasaur and not have two Charmander or squirtle and I will be pressured because the event ends into buying incubator so I can hatch eggs faster it's a Charmander it's just the mindset - of like okay I'm gonna go out there and hatch a 7k egg but what if I bought an incubator or a couple of incubators and i hatch v 7k eggs at once instead of walking 45 kilometers I only have to walk 7 kilometers and I get the results of five like I understand that this is their money-making tactic but that does it at this point I like it I don't even care what what is what is it all the server the party having to do for me literally another thing like I can trade it or I'll wait till the next party hat event where they put in the while and I put something else with a hat on yeah you're coming to my side yeah yeah there you go yes don't do the community you could maybe argue that like well they're giving you Eevee with a party hat that's in the wild yeah sure I guess but what if they just put more things in the wild then everybody would get them and they wouldn't make money yeah you're right they would make money there has to be a threshold of people who are like me who are very passionate about pokemon go who play a lot of Pokemon go who have no problem giving money to Pokemon go but at a certain point they're going to hit a threshold of these events are too many too often and super money grabby in the sense of you absolutely underestimate people's ability to wear their threshold is I mean I think you've already passed that right like have we allow right to this should I happen now now there are still plenty of people out there where Pokemon go is there one thing and they will pour that no I get that and I'm sure those people read the article and they're like oh man I can get a shiny squirtle in a party hat out of 7k egg you better believe I'm spending $40 on incubator I'm sure that person exists I'm sure they won't stop until they get all three and seven I'm sure they won't stop until they get them all I get it until they get them all with perfect IVs even the amount of people where you fall as very small I think that that I don't care about this anymore line separated a very long time ago oh oh yeah definitely there are the people where they are all in it's Pokemon go they set aside 10% of their income every month for Pokemon go and then there's people like me and Greg who are like well it's a community day and I'd like that you know uncooked cookie dough at the Mall of America and head down there I so I remember the time where they boy so I I specifically remember the Poochie it was it was what two years ago was the year of the dog cuz last year was a year the pig I think the year well I don't sorry I'm really bad thing I'd add they they really I mean shiny Poochyena and I remember that was kind of when they started doing a little bit more Chinese as specifically around these events so they would be like okay I think it was yeah cuz I think that was the time they did shiny party hat Pikachu and I was like oh I really want a shiny party hat Pikachu cuz I was like the first time they did it and I went out every single night with my friend Micah and we would we would go downtown and it was if it was nice out we would gather the car and walk but for the most part you know if it was cold we would just drive to the Pope would stop pull over stop spin check Pikachu okay drive to the next one and it was like 2 a.m. when we were doing this so there was like little to no traffic so it was really easy to park back up go again and that night I got after like four days of doing this every night I got to shiny hat party happy shoes and then when we went out for the Poochyena stuff I got the Poochyena and then I remember when they did another Pikachu and then I went out every night and I got it and then I think the last time I did that was the like the black hat Pikachu where it was in that special black hat and I was really excited and then they started doing him faster of like oh now we're rolling out shiny pokemon faster as content and then I think the one I missed but I did go out every night was like the shiny which hat Pikachu or whatever but that was like the point to me where I was like they're doing shiny they're like treating shine eases new content and they're layer layer they're doing one every week or one every other week because they need a reason for players to go out because there's nothing new to catch which is a big thing in Pokemon go right to catch Pokemon and I just can't keep up with this like it's not fun to go out every single night and check 400-plus Pokemon and then be relieved that like okay cool I got it on Wednesday night so I don't have to go out Thursday and Friday night like I and I get that's like a personal thing of like I need to go out but like I did in genuinely enjoy going out to collect things until it became overwhelming and now I feel like these party hats not only are they restricted with 7k egg stuff I feel like now that is to the point where it's overwhelming to like what I did with Chinese are like you know what I don't really care anymore it's there's so many Chinese available in the game that eventually I'll stumble upon them because I play a game enough and there's other games to get Chinese in like I don't need to go get another shiny poochy and I can just hunt for it and Omega Ruby alpha sapphire but these hats are ridiculous in the sense of in the sense of yes just let me get just like just let me find in the wild and catch it and be like okay I remember 2020 pokémon day I went out I found a Charmander in a party hat I caught it I'm no one no one can no one else cares about this somebody's gonna hatch like eight of them I'm sure and be very salty that they didn't hatch the other one and they're gonna trade the other seven away and they're gonna have one of each they're not they're not competitive they're not really worth anything they'll come around the the next year I'm sure but the fact oh my god I'm just hit let's just let the egg stuff is infuriating I like I don't even care about the rate stuff because like if I spell like I can I can go out charizard blastoise Venus or I'll I'll spend a day looking for a Venus or I'll do that raid with Irene we'll both get a Venus or 4 for free go out the next day get the Charizard got the next K get the Blastoise like I do not mind dedicating 20 to 30 minutes to be like let's find a Venus or raid let's do the Venus or raid heck I'll even spend the dollar if it's right there if a Charizard Venus or next to it heck let me just spend the dollar but I don't mind dedicating that 20 30 minutes to do it to tell me like hey Hach a 7k egg which probably takes I don't know how long does it take to walk 7k like 45 minutes maybe 30 minutes if you're power walking I would probably mean I would probably say get one of those what are those things the two wheel things that people stand on hoverboards I know Segway guess egg way I can't tell that that's not walking I think as long as under 10 miles an hour yeah is it like just called a bike could you just get on a bike that's like way cheaper than a bikes will go faster than 10 miles an hour yeah well but they don't have to I mean if you don't pedal a lot well but yeah cuz I'm this genius of the Segway is you don't have to do anything yeah lean look if leading is hard for you you got bigger problems and hats on Pokemon okay but I'm using my free incubator I when I go to the mall I make it an effort to hatch a 5k egg which is probably anywhere between 30 to 45 minutes of walking maybe I'm I feel like I'm a relatively fast Walker I'm out you always walk in front of everybody you never wait for anybody right I got places to be well it's just frustrating it doesn't you want events to be fun and when I read all of this nothing about this sounds fun it's only frustrating because you care I do care because I want I want to go out and have fun I don't want to be like oh man Wurmple ends in two days and I don't have a Wurmple yet should I just this incubator box is only four dollars but that's exactly what they want you to think have you tried bowling possibly darts bowling is a great way to go out and have fun with your friends Greg let's go bowling sometime thanks oh yeah question of the week now's when we ask it the question of the week from the attic channel in slack that is the second Muppets reference I have listened to you in the past two days what is going on with the universe right now uh Muppets are back maybe Muppets never went away friend I'm pulling a question from last week because we had good questions last week this is from Casey and our attic channel with drag Algy I lost I don't know how to say that I'm sorry drag al Lia dragged alia lost regalia drag all yeah Martin called like bank-account lost I spent ten dollars doing a cross over event with Monster Hunter do you think that Pokemon decorators could do a crossover event like this or does Pokemon doing crossovers with other games like dragon Quilla drag al Lia los dragalge dragon the bad pokemon that's not winning pokémon 25 that is not a bad pokemon is getting all my votes now the reason that regalia loss can do it is because they have their own universe and like you can like you can pull in other monsters and to say hey these monsters are dragons and you can bond with them which is what the Monster Hunter thing is and it's been super fun I think Pokemon has up like especially like masters since it's so focused on specific sync pairs that you can't really pull like just like they could maybe deal with Tim Tim because Tim Tim has the same system there's not a lot that that matches up like masters is specific that this is this person and this is their Pokemon and that doesn't exist now Pokemon could branch out to other like I would luck drug alia lost and Pokemon crossover would be great because you could do that and like it wouldn't affect the regalia lost universe had all but I don't think there's an IP out there that could go into the Pokemon universe that fits that universe has Pokemon ever done any crossovers they've crossed over games beta styles like conquest yeah it's kind of like yeah that's not a crossover though yeah but like it was in the Pokemon universe with Pokemon and not in like what the regular game is to forget what kind questions I feel like the closest thing that masters could do is is like taking a character that like they could do Ashton greninja yeah which would probably be a little bit more outside what they've been doing with main series game characters they could do Martin and Solrock if they really wanted to which I think would be cute and I think fans would appreciate that but they're still pulling from Pokemon Pro right yeah that like there's no like we just left the Megaman event where we all got Megaman intergal a lost because the universe there is wild but like you couldn't do here's Megaman and his pokémon partner rush like it doesn't work ha that mega it's not that the derp Galya lost universe is wild is that sue golly a lost has a agreement with Capcom true they do but like it works in that universe right like they've created a universe that allows for it make it like it's not so tightly encapsulated um are the things that I would like deceit like yeah I would like to see masters branch out and bring other wild games in like there's a lot of games exists out there where you have an animal partner that could come in I think it would just feel incredibly strange given how tight they are with it you know I wouldn't I wouldn't need Matt I wouldn't need other stuff in masters but I would like to see pokémon stuff in other games like I think the yokai watch event in Final Fantasy it was super fun and it was cool as like I don't even I didn't like yokai watch and even after playing you okay watch it didn't really like it but it was cool to get like little yokai to follow you in Final Fantasy or to get monster hunter things to follow you in Final Fantasy because as a final fantasy fan hey guess what I also like other games and I'm able to kind of sport and show that off in in that world which is cool nintendo badge arcade that was a crossover there you go they could the rabbit could come back and then the rabbit could have a crane sync pair yes so look the only people that like the 3ds now are people who can't afford the switch they need to excuse me I love my 3ds I play my 3ds every day you plant across you playing shuffle what do you plan all Troost moon you're not playing ultramoon every day i hatch dairy video proof look you can't talk to me my us you have your curry decks complete I've made you just completed it yeah yeah I saw you like with all your I don't know why this isn't Charizard class I got to did the beary points and I got the other points please if I want to have that much drama I'll do calculus look some of us are trying to figure out things in the game I can't even stir the pot I can't even and the flame Fanning I thought you were supposed to phantom slows he didn't actually put the fire out and you're supposed to phantom fast well you're supposed to fan it fast so it gets big and then you fan it slow cuz you don't want it to get bigger so it burns once again as a real-life chef will I can relate when the cooking of Pokemon certain shield yes please tell me about your extraordinary meal called Mickey Donnell what is this no Warner found Bergere he cooks pizza bites from the freezer true pizza rolls thank you very much pizza rolls mappers and Zippy's are oh no I had a lot of fun completing the career decks I think it's really fun look well when normally do the same it's the closest thing I have to bury farming so when next time we're together I wall bust out my switch and we'll cook locally together we'll cook well well fan will fan a fire that well fan the fire as a group and that's fine with me I don't know what we're talking about game across over so that's what it's gonna be it's their goodness well now it's gonna say they're gonna have curry cooking and poking my Master's but that's not a crossover well as our Pokemon of the week well your clues from last week I referenced the podcast Dewey dudes I talked about applying moisturizers so that you can create a protective bubble around your face and whether you should use SPF in your moisturizer because it has the damage of exposure to the fiery Sun and doubles moisturizing effectiveness for your for your skin and I also reference that there may be an alternative to Botox that is being developed from spider venom and that you should really start with an intensive skin care routine at least before you turn to age 22 that's more than enough clues yep I got it all right you it's Chimchar you're correct Chimchar has a protective bubble around its face it's due Peter Jupiter Jupiter's it is Jupiter it can be seen this is la Volpe dia can be seen as the counter part to sur surskit while the share water bug both have the same base stat total of 269 nice both evolved at the same level both can be found at brooklet Hill and sudden I actually didn't know this trivia I didn't know they they both have the same base tat and evolved at the same level both can be found in brooklet Hill in Pokemon Sun and Moon taking place of each other on time Jupiter do you pie it Jupiter found during the day and surskit at night noise alright you ready for this week's nope but go ahead this week's one it has a title and the title is called number five will shock you already shocked ten a signature ability is an ability that only one pokemon has in a Pokemon game a unique situation has now occurred because of the limited glare and pokedex that pokemon abilities that used to not be signature have become signature for example trace can now only be had by the Gardevoir line and drizzle can only be had by pelipper nine psychic-type pokémon have special attack as their highest sat on average and HP as their lowest stat on average eight pancakes are an incredibly old dish some consider them to be earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies seven the while on a coffeehouse and cocktail lounge a staple restaurant in downtown waikiki closed on september 30th 2018 their breakfast special available 24 hours a day included all the pancakes you could eat two eggs and two strips of bacon if they were still open I would recommend trying their coconut syrup six there is a statue of Duke Kahanamoku on Waikiki Beach he is widely considered the father of modern surfing five the move electric terrain has the following effects a it creates an electric train that lasts for 5 turns B it performs the following actions on Pokemon that are touching the ground 1 they cannot be put to sleep or fall asleep from rest too electric-type moves receive a 30% power boost see one Pokemon species will have its speed doubled due to its signature ability D if holding an electric seed its defense will increase by one stage for some Pokemon only learn one new move when they evolve and do not learn any other new moves after evolving they either must be learned prior to evolving by the move rememberer or through TM hm or TR 3 electric-type pokémon have special attack as their highest stat on average and HP as their lowest stab on average - there are six pokémon species known as the mouse Pokemon one Oh this week's Pokemon will only be available in Galler when Pokemon home comes out there you go it's a listicle all right favorite number five will shock you yeah it was shocked we've been putting the podcast episodes up on YouTube every Monday so if you've made it to the end of this you probably weren't listening and maybe you were listening I need to I don't know but it's just another way for whatever reason if you have a friend who like has never listened to podcasts and it's just easier to share the youtube link there's there you go I've this is this is a real this is a huge I don't know discovery I guess that getting somebody to download a you tot cast app and then subscribe to a podcast there's a lot of work and maybe the YouTube is easy for those new people and then maybe once they like the show and they realize that they want to continue listening then they get the podcast app it's like a stepping stone it's like it's like we're putting training wheels on the show for people who might not just you know know what a podcast is I mean they're out there episodes have been going up on YouTube if that's you know maybe your podcast app is blocked at YouTube at work and you get it use YouTube other YouTube content is going up so I stream pretty much every night on Twitch for like six hours that's a lot of content not sometimes nothing exciting happens in those six hours or it's hard to find the exciting part that's on how many eggs I'm hatching but every Wednesday and every Friday on YouTube there will be new content going up we pretty I have content planned actually for the next three weeks out for YouTube which is awesome so and they're cut they're cut and edited and they're a little bit more produced than just taking ten minutes and plopping it on YouTube so I think they're worth watching I think they're funny I think if you're if you're needing some other stuff YouTube is the same Twitter is the same twitch is the same just PKM and see ast so pretty easy for all that will is that wash in the sink Gregg is that white-winged I'm at dragging a lake I think that's it I think that's all we got YouTube Twitter uh what was the last one twitch I should probably remember my own social medias Instagram Instagram is also P cam and cast yeah that's true I got I got some good Instagram some people were some people were really really happy slash want to know more about the marking stuff that I did like marking shinies the stars marking Evy trained as hearts marking event polka - circles that will actually be the YouTube video for Wednesday it's almost done there will be a graphic with that as well I've been making those graphics I've been putting on Instagram and Twitter so it'll be a graphic of the markings I use personally you can customize it to what you want but and then there's a there will be a video explanation because I did explain on stream and we cut it out to make it a little bit easier to follow with with pictures going along so if you want to get into marking especially with Pokemon homecoming out and you want to be able to find your event Pokemon easier shiny pokemon easier that will be Wednesday's video and then if you missed the last Fri if last Wednesday's video that was my cult story from when I went to Japan and a traded Pokemon with a girl in Pokemon go and then she tried to get me to join her temple so that is all on youtube as well that I normally told during stream but I but yeah it supported look there's not enough time in the day to tell that story on a podcast that would be its entire podcast so if you want to hear the cult story that's on the on the youtube page as well that's all I got it's been uh it's been a heck of the show I think we actually got to 90 minutes this week so we will see you guys next week this has
