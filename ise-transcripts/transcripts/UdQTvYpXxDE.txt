[Music] what's up everyone my name is spj and I'm the host and creator of it's super effective which is a Pokemon podcast and with me I have will and you said podcast like it's a question like we haven't been doing this for six seven how many years six years I don't know anyways I'm just trying to figure out my minimum number of words i have to say before i can lean back and enjoy my free pass and then i also have travis with us today yeah coming to you live from the street pass apocalypse as before we begin I just want to give a big shout out two packs for letting us present this panel and a big shout out to you guys for filling this room I didn't this is incredible so thank you everyone for being here so this whole by the way this is being recorded so it will be our 250 fifth episode that will go live on Monday how this is going to work is you guys wrote a bunch of questions and those questions also vote for a favorite water-type pokemon so we're going to read those questions and then we're going to hopefully tally those boats and if there are ties and whatnot we're going to try to rank them so if anyone is upset please understand that this is your list not mine and we're just doing water pokemon to make it a little bit easier and then if we do future pax's we can do like grass or dark or psychic and stuff um yeah but before we begin I think I already said before we begin but how many of you have actually listened to it's super effective or heard of us all right a couple people out there's don't want to make us feel bad i'm going to switch this slideshow real quick and also just double check that this is recording okay cool all right that's what's going to be up that's where you can find us okay but let's begin all right Nick are you ready to tally if need be okay sweet oh all right Irene is also here shoutouts Irene and neck for doing all this for us they're doing the work first vote is for magic card [Applause] this is working out pretty well hey I mean you gotta start at the beginning right now question is why is pokemon snap the best pokemon game I would just say because it's wonderful no that was good I didn't nail it I didn't nail it we'll do it again no cuz I already failed once no all I know like all I know about pokemon snap is I borrowed it from like a video store one time and kept it overnight and returned it the next day and that was asked you know congratulation was a riveting story I recently played pokemon i think we all like look at pokemon snap and the fact that it was so good back then and i don't know how many of you recently applied it or whatnot but I'm Italy feel great and there's nothing bad about any of it because it's all perfect all the time let me tear it apart right now no no I will not allow view I recently played it with with my girlfriend Irene we streamed it and it was her first time actually playing it and the entire time I couldn't help but think man this game really holds up its really great and there are just a lot of little things that they do and just seeing Pokemon in motion and in that way where you're just not seeing them in combat like in sun and moon is is just really not inspiring but it's like delightful wait so have you done the the picture-taking in sun and moon it's not it's good enough for me oh it's like yeah have you haven't been taking your pictures inside a moon do it it's fine you get likes from imaginary people which I had the weirdest part of me I'll take whatever people i can get and then also those imaginary people sometimes don't like your pictures sometimes they specifically dislike what you take and that is hurtful the second vote for a pokemon is sighed duck good one yeah imma show I'd be like sorry I but I don't do voices yeah we did say that these questions didn't have to be pokemon related this question is do you play stardew valley yes yeah I love how like cheery you guys are great what about the two of you I certainly do what about the two night I do not play farm simulators no aah stardew valley is really great and if you haven't played that you should I know it's coming to nintendo switch which is really exciting yeah I can make who did you marry who did I marry I was it happen Gail abigail was like the gamer the gamer chick yeah I married what's her name Emily the one who likes like crystals and sewing and stuff oh alright you know I mean you picked wrong but that's okay a third vote here is ammonite oh no no interest no wood he's like like squishy a question is would you play a Pokemon d indeed yes and we have is the thing Travis do you want to explain yeah our D&D show you sure that wasn't it was some organic buzz marketing that just happened there well we have a side show called mythical where we play Dungeons and Dragons but in a medieval magical Pokemon setting it's as weird as it sounds but it's a lot of fun yeah it's alright it's alright so if you're in a Pokemon DD what like Travis said we do a show called mythical the cool thing about it is we have three seasons we have season 11 and a half in season two and they're all contained in its own thing so you don't have to start at season one you get to like listen to season two you could start at season two and then go back they're all there contain stories I think of a lot like Game of Thrones in this aspect of like an episode of getting through just as good there's a lot of a lot of murder no in an episode of Game of Thrones you can like they they pan to different people so a whole episode could be focused on Jon Snow and then maybe in you know 3 episode 3 episodes you won't get any job snow and then he comes back so that's kind of we think of mythical and the fact that this story is contained here in this season but if you wanted more of that then you can go back and listen to other seasons Oh supposed to be accessible so you can jump in already the next one then you guys can cool jump in we had a vote for vaporeon put all these gen one Pokemon the question is do you rock out to the album to be a master we all live in a Pokemon world yeah I think it's clear i said i don't remember the next verse oh i don't remember anything from to be a master now i'm being honest that was good out ah yeah sure so i can read a question we have another vote for psyduck good choice and then the question and i'll explain in a bit the question is what do you think of smogon cheering so smogon is a part of the pokemon competitive scene where it's sort of a community for people to battle against each other with the pokemon games competitively and so in order to facilitate that they've ordered Pokemon in two different tier structures so the ones that get used the most get stuck in the uber tier and then there's over used under that under used and it goes down like that to facilitate different formats to play with so that you end up seeing more pokemon in the structures at least that's the that's the hope and I think it worked pretty well I know it's controversial because it you know it's not an official because it's not real VGC because yeah because it's not an officially sanctioned format but I mean I people have fun with it so that's kind of all that matters and I think it does do a good job and facilitate it because you're not going to see like you know you're not going to see a charge a bug and well actually you're not going to see like there are a lot of focalin that you just wouldn't see in the efficacy format Brett yeah you wouldn't see a fur in the official VGC format because it's not allowed well with that attitude I guess my only problem with smogon tiering is when people then come to a VGC competition and don't understand that the smogon rules don't apply anymore so you can put your opponents to sleep and stuff like that but you know you'll learn eventually will you want to read one well I don't I need to call a judge on this because somebody voted for Cabral ER but I thought controller was bitter fighting just fighting so how it swallowed by this very mad what was the question though the question is best generation of Pokemon games generation five all right Steve well yeah I like gin too i would say JJ yeah I it I want to say sun and moon because I love those games a ton but I don't know if they're gonna hold up like gin to definitely held up and heartgold soulsilver is easily like one of the best games yeah to recommend to people yeah i would say whatever's going to follow Sun and Moon will probably be really amazing but then to doesn't have volcarona so it's garbage we gotta vote for squirtle I [Applause] love this question because it says what is the best and then best is scribbled out and then it says what is the worst school typing ooh uh ground water don't stop hating on gaston great um I don't four times a week to grass that is a bad thing to have um probably Oh probably a bomb snows typing right probably I mean I love iced I love ice type Pokemon it's a Christmas tree correct I love Abomasnow and I love ice types but having ice and grass is just asking for trouble your week to virtually everything but i think they determined that it's grass bug is like the worst right paris is like the paris act is the worst yeah that's a bad one too yes weaknesses and you have dry skin as well because so you're even more weak to fight yep because if you didn't just didn't get enough we fire with an essay at it on top yeah alright want me to go yep sidra vote procedure that's the first we've seen that one jeonhwa no gym to know what maybe gen 3 you're fired what do you think draw there you go that's what I was like yeah what do you think about evolution items in Pokemon go yeah the ones you can only get for like seven days in a row and stop yeah I haven't gotten any uh I think yeah evolution I don't understand why like the gimmick to EV is just give it a nickname why is there just not stones for that and well like pollito does Kings rock felix is metal coat right yep so no I think those are fine I guess yeah they're fine ah my problem is the EVC as yeah yeah I think that's a good point the problem is the inconsistency right but they don't all work like that the ones that do require items in the games we go in me next or do not it's a vote for gear dose we had a vote for magic card before so this is what is the worst pokemon we're really negative today folks what is this basis design what is the worst pokemon design yeah the worst pokemon design Mary Ellen everyone's gonna hate me no no the car goes fine bad it's just a bad Pokemon yes that's not bad not not winning a lot of fans with with our responses developed so far ah no but i would say Bascom ones probably one of the poorest design pokeman i got you beat Nick rajma what is that thing it's like I was black in hock Roach laser / airplane I guess stealth bomber maybe yeah if you haven't gotten your Nick rosman at its up in the volcano Mountain place yeah Ken Caryl Harry Hill I used to live in Hawaii I can't even get these things right we gotta vote for Asha wat agreed what was better mega evolution or Z moves I'm gonna actually say Z moves because I think so mega evolutions were cool and they allowed for new Pokemon designs which is great but i think that mega evolution as a mechanic was kind of underwhelming because it was it was never strategic there are very very few instances where it was strategic to not immediately mega evolve right like you're not going to there are very few occasions where it's more advantageous to stay the base Pokemon and not mega evolve where there are a lot of instances where hiding the fact that you have a Z move throughout the match would be advantageous so I think it opens more strategic possibility but I first risk reveals a Z move right because you have to hold the Z stone great I yeah yes it would but I mean it requires that your opponent run a Pokemon with risk now orvis the other one the ability anyways mega Mawile is one of my absolute favorites so I'm gonna go with mega evolution I actually won VGC matches with mega Mawile so go on Alex he moves better I think mega evolutions are cool and I'm glad they kept them I've said this on the show before but mega evolutions was a way to give us more Pokemon without padding that pokedex number right because mega charizard the 17 mega Charizard they made their still under Charizard number so I thought that was a nice way of giving us a quote unquote fourth evolution but also not patting the Polka deck or not increasing the pokédex number I like that what they did that they did it with a lowland forums I like the way that yeah that's another like way of not increasing the next number is it my turn or wills I can't even remember I want to go next oh is this gonna be easy magic card gets another vote aight this is going to cause a lot of your angst your top 10 people but aaron we're gonna have a lot of eggs on the panel for my solution my next question is also negative so we're really packing them in right no but anyways biggie or Tupac so the problem is it's real easy for me I have yeah I lived in Hawaii for a little while but I'm like an East Coast dude so big E all the way but these two are from the midwest they're like right on the line I would probably say biggie mmm I'm gonna keep things neutral Switzerland over here well that means biggie wins yeah we have a vote from Lapras which i think is a good good vote and then the question is what is the most over rated Pokemon I would again pause it Lucario yeah most overrated Pikachu now just thought I knew it by just nick ality Pikachu has earned every place it needs to be Pikachu has grown as a person like I Lucar is probably one of my least favorite pokemon but I totally get why people like Lucario and I connect you want to do and it did things for the franchise that other Pokemon didn't do if it was it's not like a Pikachu but like Lucario i would say falls under the same category that Charizard does of everyone knows it and they definitely tried to put zoroark in that place and zoroark is amazing Noah's Ark fail which is that are cooler than Lucario well they got my shirt and show you my zoroark tattoo no thank you let's go not gonna happen i was gonna get real interesting oh I would say look how are those overrated well what's your answer I mean I said Pikachu I get back what Celebi all right how about salad the onion head nothing on the last popular of an answer we've gotta vote for star you yeah the question is what do you hippos eat they eat little white spheres right hungry hungry hippo hi I believe hippos are herbivores so they eat like underwater reeds are they also like really mean you're Carrie are you gonna like they like varied fatal if you interact with them too yeah yeah not fun now that I've experienced it but I'm going to go again I gotta vote for a magic card we have a front-runner yeah we do real obvious lead here would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse sigh horse-sized duck but why am i fighting the animals I didn't I'm just I'm just reading it the one horse-sized duck hmm I can I don't have any funny jokes about it but that's just the correct answer I don't know you do a lot of kicking yeah you can kick a lot of horses a hundred is a lot and it's not I mean we got 14 hundred people here I'm not going to quite all these boots oh you're the fighting doesn't risk our little I couldn't I can kick pretty hard I don't know what I would do against a huge duck run oh but you know what you could like pie you can roast it after it's dead and like peeking doc is so good like the best Peking Duck you know restaurant in the countries around DC so i could just card it in there it's amazing can I go next yeah a real good one so I gotta vote for Wailord whoo all right real big pokemon and the question is and all I'm gonna answer first who are you people so I'm William Anderson i'm 44 years old i work at Georgetown University and IT support all right I'm Trevor wheeler I work in a movie theater like a I know or any of us really if we think about it I'm waiting for the what makes a chair chair question no nope no hopefully rrisd moderators have not elected to give us that question Travis you want to read one oh yeah sure another vote for lap rest and the question is what is our favorite eeveelution eeveelution I would want I would say vaporeon why you'll be honest my answer oh it sounds good by me for you why no I like water as you can tell from oh I took that down as you can tell about the type so I'm gonna have to go with umbreon excited like and it's got the best design and it's got a really cool shiny I always okay so i'm i'm pretty confident I'm Brianna and SPN are always frontrunners we get a cheer for umbreon all right what about SPM so I can't tell it sounds pretty identical pretty even it's always neck and neck I we gotta vote for greninja decent weight regular greninja or ash no no there's no ash here as there should it be which was the one yr the professor so hot hmm I mean all professors Burt's just gets me good I would rather just not question this great gift were given and every single Pokemon get like why question it and ruin the possibility of not getting another one I have no answer i just sorry I googling images images of Professor Kakui I was distracted by completely all right i got 1 a slow bro gotta vote for so gross ok strangely enough i don't know how to answer this question so I'm gonna have to rely on you guys why doesn't Dunsparce evolve into grandpa it would be perfect yeah I don't Dunsparce isn't a dragon but it could be not with that attitude yeah I think Dunsparce is already like tied to some sort of Japanese yeah fairy creature so but it's normal type not fairy yet so I like the the fact that there are pokemon that look like each other but they're not related you got your bouffalant sand yeah you got your love dis wanna be one your elements yeah I think that's okay I mean it's like if they did it for one Pokemon it be frustrating but they do it to enough that it's like all right and I see where you're going just sort of echoing back yeah ma so the we have a vote for greninja which is what we just got right regular green ninja or a skirt it's nobody vote for ash greninja a ninja and then the question is if you could make a Pokemon what would it look like what would its tight be and what would its signature move to how that's so but give us half an hour I gotta come back I don't think they've done this but what if it was an ice cream cone yeah I'm interested you got my attention really outside the box with that hmm I would want to see an actual kangaroo pokemon that isn't kangaskhan because kangaskhan is no bueno oh but I want to see like a slim and thick kangaroo with boxing gloves okay you're totally cheating because we have been discussing that in our community for like past two weeks k display talkin like is that the one with the kangaroo okay I got confirmation from themselves if that is the Ganga river the chaos in like Oracle of Ages or sometimes Elda yeah that's like the ones Elda I've played yeah and you remember the kangaroo boxing kangaroo would be memorable they could be the next Lucario I'm honey yeah not real hard time with this too hard a question I think I got one good answer out of it maybe what if I what if I question like this we got to vote for Mudkip ah what the question is what pokemon deserves a mega evolution hmm still outstanding mega Victini valley the best what it changes type to just pure fire type cuz it just gets really angry like what is the yeah and it gets like boss okay whoo Steve like what what do you think not evolution mega evolution farfetch Everlast if there's a so imagine that farfetch is leaked turned into like a samurai sword that's all I got I going back let's do mega vanilluxe for ice cream cones of shine all right now we're talking I just there's no question here but there's a vote for seal so shout out to co oh you guys anymore I need more all right let me read a question off of them lol cypher here I got a vote for vaporeon what is your favorite non pokemon game chrono trigger for me Thank You trauma to your fans yeah wait is it like favorite of all time or like favorite of like right now favorite non pokemon game I mean katamari damacy is possibly the most perfect game ever created but I think wills better we love Katamari is no no no no no no no correct and cut Amari Demasi you roll up and you make the mood in the family's all together and you want to talk about about rolling up the entire universe and we love you Taylor yes boy I guess it's like it's for like 3 console generations ago so for right now monster hunter generations play every single day even played it this morning all right I will I heard all of it sharing a hotel room I would probably say destiny yeah too many hours too much money spent not getting moved over to destiny too I gotta vote for Blastoise what do you think is the best offensive dual typing probably more for Travis cuz yeah um I has to be a real one too so I mean I'm for purely talking about often like because ice that's the thing with Isis that it's good to have often silly but not defensively so maybe like ice ice dragon like your um the greatest dragon all the game sure no dragon isn't a good type often simply cuz only super effective against so maybe like ice fairy or something would be pretty good mmm don't know whatever you got double coverage I can't this is too harsh ghost way that goes fighting does sound good yeah all right we gotta vote for weasel this is a question for Travis no no what is considered too much water the Hoenn region hey yeah that's a good answer it's amazing that they could like ruin Hoenn but in a Lola it's all islands but yeah but you know it's just right yeah but you don't have to spend all of it we don't I said I would have a new year's resolution where I wouldn't get angry so I stopped myself mid-sentence we have a vote for gastro Don which we were just will and I were having an argument about gastro done before we started this I like gastrin I'll I think astronaut is a troll VGC Pokemon and please leave this auditorium the question is have you played Fire Emblem yet and then the person says in some ways it's better than Pokemon in some areas um I've only played Fire Emblem heroes the iOS game so I'm not a very good judge of the franchise in my role for any video game that I'll ever play has to have three things it has to be cute has to involve rolling and has to involve collecting things and I this does you gotta collect the heroes what do you roll your your crew down the street have you played fire in one steam I have you I like firing them it's it's a time commitment though I gotta vote for Lapras the question is what is your favorite starter Syndic well of course froakie probably Oshawott really yeah he's beautiful no I mean I'm gonna be started on it's evolutions but although you know I do have a level 100 chespin because I refused to evolve it because I really really like chespin quilladin quilladin is great I know I mean that basically i did but alright i'm surprised this is our first vote for melodic and the question is what is the funniest looking pokemon hmm there's this an ice cream cone anything like food-related that's that's usually a garba doors pretty funny car hoarder yeah yeah oh no spin de-spin yeah it's been doesn't get drunk all the time it's wrong it's time of our time I think I am I vibe goes for oddish cuz like it's funny like cute like a weed like a weed eat we done dude is it my turn I guess it is it's a vote for vaporeon huh and then the question is do you play competitive Pokemon kind of I i use in sorry do you play competitive Pokemon okay i used two more and we talked about it on the show so I'm red up enough on it that I can continue talking about it but I don't play it enough to where I can confidently say yes anymore yeah but you do showdown like from time to time yeah yeah yes yeah I go to VGC regionals I tried to go to one regional year so I'll build one team for whatever the meta is at that time but it's just to have fun at of regionals I don't like try to win I think if Pokemon company store a 44 year old man in their champion yeah they probably cancel the whole thing we're know your yours or maybe not that I couldn't take it all I'll just leave it to the kids who actually might need a scholarship yeah our podcast just be more competitive and it we we shied away from that because there are just better outlets for that there's a lot of youtubers that are really great with competitive and it's easier to show I think then listen to that but we do do a Pokemon of the week every episode and Travis gets one or two move sets that he puts together with with our community and so at least if you are in competitive we talk about you know Louis and / which I think was last week we will give you a move setting and actually tell you why that works I think a lot of times you can read them you can read a move set off like smoke out or something and then that doesn't actually tell you you can find you can find it but right off the bat just reading a move set doesn't tell you how you should use it or what you should pair that with it's like going out to dinner and parents take with a fine wine and something like that we're not that fancy we're like out back when it comes to VG sees no rules just right but i would say anybody who's ever thought about going to a VGC regionals even if you don't have a great team just go and have fun because you're around a bunch of people who just want to play pokemon competitions for a couple of hours you don't have to win to have fun yeah I played the BGC very creditably when gen5 came out and yeah a lot of a lot of fun but it's it's a time commitment and I think that's why a lot of people do like showdown and stuff to lessen that load we had a vote for feraligatr who how many pokemon is too many never never yeah now we haven't hit it yet we got pokemon bank now you can just like put them in the bank and I see more I think the fact that they've done things like mega evolution and then the low in forums shows that the pokemon company is at least aware that there's a certain pace at which they can introduce new Pokemon where it might be too much to continue to be able to remember all of them so introducing these ones that are then related to already released Pokemon at least makes it lightens that memory load as the next game comes outside I think they recognize the sort of inherent inflation of just increasing the number of Pokemon every game I think they've recognized that problem yeah i think the alone in pokemon do such a good job of reminding you what pokemon existed out of the 700 you might have forgotten like think about before sun and moon came out how many people were that excited for executor and then all of a sudden a lull in executor cam and everyone was like oh my god look up to Ellen is ah and if you were to ask me a year ago what I thought of executor I would have been gentle okay it's a tree cool but now you know more than the treehouse legit now it's rolling but yeah I like that treatment of like okay we're going to allow lymph I we're going to Lowell in by this Pokemon in and bring something back to it and obviously we're going to get to a thousand Pokemon eventually right yeah and I feel like that thousands Pokemon is going to be really special and they're gonna give it the lucario push yeah hopefully it's just you know not Lucario junior or something like that you know is it amazing they already have what is riolu it's already that what a gift gen5 was that you could just catch like 150 Pokemon and have your regional decks and you didn't have to worry about all these other like what is it what's the lowest side of the regional deck decks for Lola is it like 300 yeah I don't remember yeah it's too big oh yeah yeah the gen 5 is really good is it my turn to ask a question I don't have any questions left so go ahead so we have a vote for suicune and then yeah it's a good move not like that and then the question is if you could create a new type of Pokemon what would it be mmm sound type oh you're yeah you're like cheating is you're just like giving answers you've already given it that one because I'm so confident in these answers so there are so many set okay so first off you have like hook my clown Loudred and Noah Verne and you could even you could even put like Magnemite and and Magneton and magnetometer that because of how they emit waves but then you have moves like growl snarl a sonic boom name a single pokemon move that would not make a sound come on what is the sound of one Pokemon them call mine is a good answer yeah notice I got the right answer and you just talking about splash water now sound would be a legit the correct answer is don't create a new type it's already confusing enough to remember that bug resists ground or is it the other way around nobody knows nope nobody knows you're out of questions well right yeah i'll get some thumb vote for star me what pokemon do you wish hadn't evolved hmm chespin no no so weird the starter is the only one that doesn't evolve lettin is a good at well it is already don't get me started on live I'm a big fan of it my mom was super disappointed in Layton's evolution she was like I had a cute little cat but what happens oh I don't know your wrestler I'll also go the starter I'll say dar tricks I like better than to said you I why I already look like dart trick so I guess it's just a vanity thing am i up yeah all right vote for pip good book please look better than oshawott the question is what is the best first Pokemon game and maybe we interpreted that is like what is the best pokemon game for someone to start with like what is the best entry into the series I might say black and white are pretty good I you don't want to set them off your disappointment but yours down so good the game is good and it keeps things simple for the same reason that will mentioned before that it's it's all the pokemon are new so you don't have this expectation of like having t'en know things that the other players at the same time didn't and there's only 150 or 151 to worry about until the until the postgame so keeps things simple for a new player indeed more oxygen x and y are also a good answer yeah x and y is good because you can farm berries all day long fantastic and you can cross breed them and you make the mulches oh why did they give it any only person that ever did very farming every day I loved it I was so peaceful alright i would i would say heartgold soulsilver is a good place to start so complicated nah i was nine years old I understood Pokemon back when gold and silver came out a very advanced bah haha okay go yep squirtle is the vote the question is dogs or cats I got one of each and I hate my cat so dogs there we go uh I guess dogs yeah sick cats and lit no spray whole month and the vols into an even greater Pokemon uh Travis oh sure yeah it's a vote for gold doc which this is another good pokemon the question is wait I have to read this again what is oh okay what is the least non-water type water-type pokemon so i guess that means what is the water-type pokemon that seems like it shouldn't deserve water-type shouldn't deserve it don't look like it has water Titus to answer wait am I might confuse volcania on that dudes well yeah that makes and a water waters got no water this fire and water a part of him is water he can do the water through his like Jesse I mean I haven't seen him do anything so now look at hartnell I guess so much he's a steam yeah he's like a tasty buck uh doesn't have the authorized confirmed that's a bit it gasps ferdon that shouldn't be water what no that is a slug I gotta vote for vaporeon which for trainers from all the elite four are the most elite that's my god yeah you think these are ya homework assignment somebody thought instant lance and lance's well he's got another dragonite fun awesome yeah that's a problem of lances injured one he doesn't actually use dragon type Pokemon he has a gyarados he has a narrow dactyl maybe he'd like to Dragon Knights right yeah that's the problem is he he could have been great if they just held it like waited but they were like hey we need a dragon person at the end and we only hate we freaked we messed up guys 150 Pokemon we only have dragonite we drop the ball I would say Agatha is more memorable Agatha school and she's old and awesome like Truffaut laddoos just cut keep that to yourself I think hard to pick for like what's like the hardest elite four person um I'm trying to even think of what game had the most difficult to leap for maybe because I feel like the last few games have been pretty easy as problems are it's really like maybe like gen 3 or 4 might have had them or jen to start even say my problem is like gen 3 4 and 5 I get super blurry on elite four people what do you mean blurry like you don't remember I don't really remember yeah so that like I remember Agatha and I think what also helps was that when they did the short series oh yeah generation i put my generations like I don't know when i watch that egga thought also stood out there to me too yeah well I'm gonna go to one it's only gonna be anything yes elite one can I get a question yet gotta vote for marsh stop so congrats that one that's a real crawl out how would you improve Pokemon go I got an easy answer for this because the only time I get to play pokemon go because I'm one of those 40 hour week job people is when I'm walking my dog and we pretty much just walk the same mile every time so I see the same Pokemon every time the same focus tops if they could like mix it up they do they just don't do it and it's not enough it's not enough to keep me interested so that would help i'm always a fan of making sure all of the mechanics of the game are visible and understandable to the player without really having to dig into it like unless you're parked on the subreddit all the time you're not going to know how like nests work and what a nest rotation is and all this stuff and it for a while nobody really knew how the game worked at first until just word of mouth spread and there's i guess there's some value to that because it feels like you are sort of solving a mystery together but I don't necessarily think that a casual video game should also be a mystery I think it should be clear how the game is played and that all of the mechanics are also why is heracross only available in like South America yeah that's that's my problem is like the Kangas like king of scans only in Australia and I think farfetch is only in Japan Europe Europe now so I mr. my Maharaja your family and there's no trading now yeah yeah yeahs not but names aide said I think they said that training was not a lot of things which which I agree with I think the training should be locally because otherwise somebody's just going to farm Kangaskhan yeah and all right well we have like 10 minutes so again shout out to Nick and I Irene for tallying your votes here so we have a lot of ties so we're going to have to talk this out who figure this out so a tie for fifth place way up high

all right tie for second place I've ordered her applause we have Magikarp tough tough competition uh Blastoise and vaporeon it's like that back side over there is very vaporeon but yeah it's generalized blast vaporeon people got here late i think may pour en lost that I think so Blastoise that one that yeah I guess this big poori on it's like all the people who got left out in the hall I feel bad they were pushed aside by the Unruh and espeon lower yeah hey it could be overlap their magic on zomato listen one more time for magic harp and this is this is between number two here so
