12 (2:47 - 2:50)
pack i've drunk one and i'd like regret (2:47 - 2:52)
everything that in my life that has led (2:50 - 2:53)
up to this (2:52 - 2:57)
moment it is oh my there's no redeeming (2:53 - 2:58)
this (2:57 - 3:01)
awful excuse for a soda (2:58 - 3:05)
well yeah what what about the packaging (3:01 - 3:07)
made you think i want to buy this (3:05 - 3:10)
i uh i mean it looks (3:07 - 3:13)
the packaging looks like chaos so you (3:10 - 3:15)
just know it's gonna be chaos in your (3:13 - 3:16)
mouth (3:15 - 3:20)
i was hungry (3:16 - 3:20)
i normally get diet pepsi and i was like (3:22 - 3:28)
i need a week off from diet pepsi but i (3:25 - 3:30)
need a caffeinated soda i know (3:28 - 3:33)
mountain dew has the most caffeine of (3:30 - 3:34)
any soda but i just (3:33 - 3:36)
i don't like regular mountain dew flavor (3:34 - 3:38)
i was like let me try (3:36 - 3:41)
not only have they branded this major (3:38 - 3:43)
melon in regular (3:41 - 3:46)
sugar full you can get major melon zero (3:43 - 3:49)
sugar i was like this is a calling out (3:46 - 3:50)
to me (3:49 - 3:53)
i didn't i don't want dr pepper no (3:50 - 3:56)
and yet i mean dr pepper is the greatest (3:53 - 3:57)
drink (3:56 - 4:00)
so i don't know why he even said that no (3:57 - 4:02)
mr tube is the greatest drink (4:00 - 4:04)
i would have been better served to buy (4:02 - 4:06)
caffeine pills and crush them into my (4:04 - 4:07)
bubbly (4:06 - 4:09)
that would have been the wiser choice (4:07 - 4:12)
isn't there a caffeinated water (4:09 - 4:13)
yeah it's called water (4:12 - 4:15)
[Music] (4:13 - 4:17)
it's very bitter it's very bitter you (4:15 - 4:18)
can definitely taste the uh (4:17 - 4:21)
the after the caffeine whatever they add (4:18 - 4:23)
to it (4:21 - 4:25)
yeah that's the day after taste did you (4:23 - 4:28)
also purchase this mountain dew (4:25 - 4:31)
super melon wartime (4:28 - 4:34)
better believe i did greg i suspect you (4:31 - 4:36)
purchased this as well because you know (4:34 - 4:39)
that the packaging features a watermelon (4:36 - 4:39)
with an (4:39 - 4:42)
army helmet on it okay well one i had to (4:39 - 4:44)
look it up on the internet because i (4:42 - 4:45)
didn't believe you were actually talking (4:44 - 4:49)
about a real thing (4:45 - 4:49)
two i've never seen this i haven't (4:50 - 4:57)
just came out like uh two weeks ago well (4:54 - 4:59)
look at me early adopter spoiler major (4:57 - 4:59)
melon (4:59 - 5:02)
is a new pokemon in the next game and (4:59 - 5:04)
then i looked at the packaging (5:02 - 5:06)
and literally said nothing about this is (5:04 - 5:08)
selling me on this product (5:06 - 5:10)
you don't know skateboards okay this (5:08 - 5:12)
appeals to the skateboard (5:10 - 5:15)
oh is this your radical uh (5:12 - 5:19)
skateboarding nature the rebels yeah (5:15 - 5:22)
you know wild wild man (5:19 - 5:26)
watermelons with sharp teeth and (5:22 - 5:29)
tongue sticking out who came up with (5:26 - 5:31)
this (5:29 - 5:31)
steve your review of mountain dew major (5:31 - 5:34)
melon (5:34 - 5:37)
uh it's pretty mediocre uh i thought i (5:34 - 5:39)
mean i finished the 12-pack (5:37 - 5:42)
it's it's pretty disgusting it's i it's (5:39 - 5:46)
better oh here's what here's my review (5:42 - 5:46)
it's better than regular mountain dew (5:48 - 5:55)
but that's a love bar because i i think (5:53 - 5:56)
regular mountain dew is pretty (5:55 - 5:58)
pretty not great it's just it's just (5:56 - 6:00)
blind citrus (5:58 - 6:02)
like what's not great about mountain dew (6:00 - 6:04)
it's just literally (6:02 - 6:06)
slightly citrus and mostly caffeine this (6:04 - 6:07)
is bland (6:06 - 6:11)
watermelon i mean i'm not into that (6:07 - 6:12)
because i just bought my whole thing of (6:11 - 6:15)
watermelon bubbly which was on sale (6:12 - 6:16)
which we know i love (6:15 - 6:18)
i am into anything that has new on it (6:16 - 6:20)
though like if i walk down the candy (6:18 - 6:22)
aisle and then it says new on the (6:20 - 6:25)
packaging i'm in you got me (6:22 - 6:29)
so like pokemon snap why are you s (6:25 - 6:33)
such a fool why are you a marketer's (6:29 - 6:36)
absolute dream customer ideally (6:33 - 6:40)
i haven't been alive for uh many many (6:36 - 6:41)
years (6:40 - 6:43)
and you are like i in a world that (6:41 - 6:44)
there's no world of seven (6:43 - 6:47)
like you pretend you are the most (6:44 - 6:48)
sophisticated buyer (6:47 - 6:51)
and yet somebody just has slapped new on (6:48 - 6:52)
something and like i'm (6:51 - 6:54)
in and if they said new and rare you (6:52 - 6:55)
would buy (6:54 - 6:58)
50 of them no i just like 100 a lie (6:55 - 6:59)
because if there was a package that said (6:58 - 7:00)
new lettuce (6:59 - 7:03)
no he'd still walk on by that yeah he's (7:00 - 7:04)
not touching no (7:03 - 7:06)
wet paper this is why i have an (7:04 - 7:08)
appreciation for burger king (7:06 - 7:10)
because they always have new things on (7:08 - 7:12)
their menu and i'm the guy that's like (7:10 - 7:16)
yeah i want to try that burger taco (7:12 - 7:20)
me up except you don't want to try (7:16 - 7:22)
like you want new things in your safe (7:20 - 7:23)
zone (7:22 - 7:26)
yeah 100 so small correct you (7:23 - 7:28)
don't explore out that you're like well (7:26 - 7:29)
it's new but (7:28 - 7:31)
also slightly in my safe zone i guess (7:29 - 7:33)
this is my major (7:31 - 7:36)
new year's resolution i'm going to try a (7:33 - 7:36)
slightly (7:36 - 7:39)
different flavor of mountain new and (7:36 - 7:42)
call it exploring (7:39 - 7:45)
a million percent correct (7:42 - 7:49)
it's like oh new sour patch kids i like (7:45 - 7:52)
sour patch kids (7:49 - 7:54)
i am definitely willing to try a (7:52 - 7:56)
slightly new version (7:54 - 8:00)
of this candy that i'm confident i like (7:56 - 8:02)
what could they even do to make sour (8:00 - 8:04)
patch kids new (8:02 - 8:07)
oh new flavors i don't know but i will (8:04 - 8:08)
hustle for a sour pass (8:07 - 8:12)
patch kid uh sponsorship on this show i (8:08 - 8:13)
mean it's possible (8:12 - 8:17)
like what do we need to do probably let (8:13 - 8:20)
them know we're interested (8:17 - 8:20)
i mean how many more flavors can they (8:20 - 8:25)
come up with for sour patch kids (8:23 - 8:28)
they could go even more sour yeah but i (8:25 - 8:30)
mean more sour (8:28 - 8:34)
isn't new it just improved (8:30 - 8:36)
which is also a phrase that that makes (8:34 - 8:37)
me (8:36 - 8:39)
question humanity new and improved which (8:37 - 8:41)
is it (8:39 - 8:43)
it can't be new if you've improved on (8:41 - 8:44)
something (8:43 - 8:46)
because that thing existed before and (8:44 - 8:48)
you're improving on it (8:46 - 8:49)
speaking of new (8:48 - 8:52)
[Music] (8:49 - 8:54)

we have three different pokemon go (9:26 - 9:30)
things (9:29 - 9:32)
that all apply to money but in very (9:30 - 9:34)
different ways (9:32 - 9:37)
one is a lawsuit that (9:34 - 9:40)
the pokemon that niantic wins one (9:37 - 9:42)
is somebody being fined for playing (9:40 - 9:44)
pokemon go (9:42 - 9:47)
and the last is how much money pokemon (9:44 - 9:48)
go has made (9:47 - 9:51)
in 2020 there's a lot here if you don't (9:48 - 9:52)
play pokemon go (9:51 - 9:54)
i feel like the three articles here are (9:52 - 9:57)

using 96 code global plus plus apps were (15:30 - 15:35)
tweaked versions of niantic's games (15:33 - 15:37)
allowing players (15:35 - 15:40)
the ability to spoof their gps and use (15:37 - 15:42)
auto walk functions among other features (15:40 - 15:44)
as part of the lawsuit global plus plus (15:42 - 15:45)
faced charges (15:44 - 15:47)
including copyright infringement and (15:45 - 15:49)
violation of computer fraud and the (15:47 - 15:50)
abuse act (15:49 - 15:52)
the cheaters were founded to have (15:50 - 15:54)
accessed and copied niantic's map data (15:52 - 15:57)
and have been financially benefiting (15:54 - 15:58)
from its actions (15:57 - 16:00)
selling access to his programs which (15:58 - 16:02)
allowed players to cheat the system (16:00 - 16:04)
as part of the settlement go global plus (16:02 - 16:07)
plus has agreed to pay 5 million in (16:04 - 16:07)
damages (16:07 - 16:09)
it will also stop making these hacks (16:07 - 16:11)
selling using niantic's code and won't (16:09 - 16:13)
interfere with niantic's mobile games (16:11 - 16:16)
or servers again niantic has been been (16:13 - 16:18)
involved in a couple lawsuits over the (16:16 - 16:19)
past few years (16:18 - 16:22)
including a 2019 settlement involving (16:19 - 16:23)
pokemon go (16:22 - 16:26)
and angry home owners good old (16:23 - 16:29)
lake park milwaukee wisconsin (16:26 - 16:32)
it all comes back milwaukee lost that (16:29 - 16:34)
lawsuit by the way (16:32 - 16:37)
uh this year they did the year prior (16:34 - 16:39)
niantic settled a class action lawsuit (16:37 - 16:41)
and agreed to pay attendees of the (16:39 - 16:44)
chicago pokemon go festival their share (16:41 - 16:46)
of a 1.5 million dollar settlement (16:44 - 16:50)
you know i'm curious they said they they (16:46 - 16:52)
agree to the settlement for five million (16:50 - 16:53)
they're gonna stop (16:52 - 16:55)
selling and making these apps but i (16:53 - 16:56)
would assume that (16:55 - 17:00)
global plus plus probably is okay (16:56 - 17:02)
five million is probably a huge hit but (17:00 - 17:04)
they probably they probably made their (17:02 - 17:06)
money over the years well how many years (17:04 - 17:08)
have they been in business (17:06 - 17:12)
um i think they s started with (17:08 - 17:15)
ingress oh well yeah and people are just (17:12 - 17:18)
so comfortable cheating at pokemon go (17:15 - 17:21)
no surprise okay last article here (17:18 - 17:25)
at least regarding pokemon go and money (17:21 - 17:29)
and money this is off uh go nintendo.com (17:25 - 17:31)
a pokemon go pulls in (17:29 - 17:34)
one 1.92 billion (17:31 - 17:37)
in revenue for 2020. last time we heard (17:34 - 17:39)
about pokemon go's revenue was on (17:37 - 17:40)
december 15th of last year (17:39 - 17:42)
at the time we heard the game pulled in (17:40 - 17:43)
roughly 1.2 billion (17:42 - 17:45)
now final numbers have been crunched and (17:43 - 17:48)
the final total for 2020 is considerably (17:45 - 17:48)
higher (17:48 - 17:51)
according to super data niantic and (17:48 - 17:53)
pokemon company had a fantastic year (17:51 - 17:55)
pokemon ago pulled in (17:53 - 17:59)
1.9 1.92 billion dollars in revenue (17:55 - 18:02)
when the year closed out it is unclear (17:59 - 18:03)
if the earlier reporting was a bit off (18:02 - 18:05)
but the game saw a huge boost the last (18:03 - 18:07)
couple weeks of 2020 (18:05 - 18:09)
either way all parties involved must be (18:07 - 18:10)
happy (18:09 - 18:12)
uh with how impressive the game (18:10 - 18:15)
continues to be that's a lot of money (18:12 - 18:17)
this immediately made me open up my (18:15 - 18:19)
robin hood so i can see how much is (18:17 - 18:21)
niantic trading for today (18:19 - 18:24)
why can't i find niantic does niantic (18:21 - 18:26)
not trade on the stock exchange (18:24 - 18:28)
i don't think so are they keeping that (18:26 - 18:30)
one point whatever billion to themselves (18:28 - 18:34)
and not sharing it with me i would (18:30 - 18:35)
assume they would just be sharing with (18:34 - 18:38)
a good old pokemon company first and (18:35 - 18:40)
foremost (18:38 - 18:41)
[Applause] (18:40 - 18:44)
hmm this is sus it says buy or sell (18:41 - 18:46)
niantic stock pre-ipo via (18:44 - 18:50)
an equity zen fund that doesn't make (18:46 - 18:51)
sense (18:50 - 18:54)
uh so the last thing i find was back (18:51 - 18:58)
in 2019 uh (18:54 - 19:00)
they have no plans to go for a public (18:58 - 19:01)

it is the best community day and anybody (28:12 - 28:16)
who says differently (28:14 - 28:18)

actively sought (28:18 - 28:20)
out people on twitter who are (28:19 - 28:23)
complaining about it and posting i think (28:20 - 28:24)
this is wonderful (28:23 - 28:27)
it's a great pokemon as a jerk test to (28:24 - 28:30)
see how they responded (28:27 - 28:32)
i would argue that it's a wonderful (28:30 - 28:33)

the (28:57 - 28:59)
eighth community in a row or something (28:57 - 29:00)

pokemon that are not new shinies i think (29:00 - 29:05)
or something of the sort (29:03 - 29:07)

us by not giving us a new shiny with (29:09 - 29:14)
this community day how dare they i am (29:12 - 29:15)
done with this game (29:14 - 29:19)
um but i guess my argument would be like (29:15 - 29:22)
one not everyone played two to three (29:19 - 29:23)
years ago (29:22 - 29:26)
two why would you why would you not save (29:23 - 29:28)
the good communities until after the (29:26 - 29:29)
pandemic is over (29:28 - 29:33)
this is a good community day (29:29 - 29:33)
well sure this is argument arguably (29:33 - 29:40)
the best community today they have done (29:36 - 29:42)
since the start of pokemon go (29:40 - 29:44)
i don't know even better than the one (29:42 - 29:46)
where they revealed miltan accidentally (29:44 - 29:49)
it wasn't an accident yeah (29:46 - 29:51)
i mean that thing's like i'm just (29:49 - 29:55)
playing into the whole oh okay (29:51 - 29:56)
yeah i think it's fine i mean there (29:55 - 29:59)
there's going to be a point where (29:56 - 30:00)
these events are going to repeat (29:59 - 30:02)
themselves uh and they're just repeating (30:00 - 30:04)
themselves during a time where it's hard (30:02 - 30:06)
to get outside so (30:04 - 30:07)
we're at the point where they're (30:06 - 30:09)
repeating things we were at the point (30:07 - 30:12)
two years ago when they repeated them (30:09 - 30:12)
before (30:12 - 30:15)
like they they do catch up days all the (30:12 - 30:16)
time (30:15 - 30:19)
they do catch up months all of december (30:16 - 30:21)
i'm not a big ketchup fan i prefer (30:19 - 30:23)
mustard or broccoli (30:21 - 30:25)
on ketchup day i just stay home i mean (30:23 - 30:26)
but two (30:25 - 30:29)
exclusive moves bullet seed and weather (30:26 - 30:30)
ball (30:29 - 30:33)
fire look at the great things plus (30:30 - 30:36)
the best shiny in the game (30:33 - 30:36)
uh so whether ball changes according to (30:38 - 30:42)
the weather (30:41 - 30:45)
that's on the field in the regular games (30:42 - 30:49)
so apparently they are giving it a set (30:45 - 30:52)
type in go so they're saying (30:49 - 30:56)
weatherball will always do fire (30:52 - 30:59)
and not change (30:56 - 31:01)
which is kind of weird since they (30:59 - 31:03)
introduced seasons that had weather (31:01 - 31:04)
forever but (31:03 - 31:06)
whatever look they're trying desperately (31:04 - 31:07)
to have (31:06 - 31:09)
all the balance as pos as possible for (31:07 - 31:10)
uh (31:09 - 31:15)
their gbl i am going to be taking (31:10 - 31:17)
many snapshots for my surprises during (31:15 - 31:18)
this game (31:17 - 31:19)
i don't know what the surprises are i'm (31:18 - 31:21)
sure it's just more rosalia (31:19 - 31:24)
in your picture but i'm into that i'm (31:21 - 31:25)
i'm sure it is (31:24 - 31:27)

i was out i had burned out in december (31:29 - 31:33)
trying to get to 40. (31:31 - 31:35)
i was done with this game and they (31:33 - 31:36)

[Music] (35:22 - 35:25)
and we are back from our break (35:27 - 35:34)
it was uh it currently is i suppose as a (35:31 - 35:36)
recording but when this podcast comes (35:34 - 35:36)
out (35:36 - 35:41)
it was players cup three this weekend (35:36 - 35:44)
greg and will how'd you do i did great (35:41 - 35:44)
uh i (35:44 - 35:47)
went zero and zero oh my (35:44 - 35:51)
held my record strong i didn't give (35:47 - 35:52)
anything away (35:51 - 35:55)
it was great i thought this meant that i (35:52 - 35:56)
was just supposed to have coffee out of (35:55 - 35:57)
my play (35:56 - 36:00)
on player coffee cup that was my play as (35:57 - 36:03)
cup (36:00 - 36:03)
you're not wrong well how did you do (36:06 - 36:12)
steve i watched some of it (36:10 - 36:14)
not as good as i wanted i don't think i (36:12 - 36:16)
qualified unfortunately i ended at (36:14 - 36:19)
um 16 11. (36:16 - 36:21)
you don't think you qualified or you (36:19 - 36:22)
know you didn't qualify i know i (36:21 - 36:26)
was too qualified okay the the qualified (36:22 - 36:28)
people came to you and said (36:26 - 36:31)
no no they did they did not come to me (36:28 - 36:35)
and say you did not qualify but i ranked (36:31 - 36:38)
i did my 45 matches you can't do more (36:35 - 36:41)
only allowed i had a ranking of 16 (36:38 - 36:45)
11. um you start at 1 500. uh and then (36:41 - 36:46)
in order to qualify you probably need to (36:45 - 36:49)
be closer to 16.50 which i believe i was (36:46 - 36:52)
1648 last time for players cup 2. (36:49 - 36:55)
uh and i was a thousandth in the world (36:52 - 36:57)
i think a thousand one thousand and (36:55 - 36:58)
eleventh place (36:57 - 37:01)
when i ended which means i mean there's (36:58 - 37:02)
still people (37:01 - 37:03)
participating now so that number could (37:02 - 37:05)
go up or could go down but (37:03 - 37:09)
since they're taking the top 800 players (37:05 - 37:13)
ish 256 from north america 256 from (37:09 - 37:14)
south america (37:13 - 37:17)
128 oceana and then 256 europe (37:14 - 37:19)
pretty sure i'm out of that barrier (37:17 - 37:21)
unless for some (37:19 - 37:24)
reason 500 japanese players qualify (37:21 - 37:27)
or like top credit or placed high (37:24 - 37:28)
because (37:27 - 37:31)
japan can play but they can't qualify i (37:28 - 37:32)
was just gonna say (37:31 - 37:35)
what if there was a whole bunch of (37:32 - 37:38)
disqualifications because of cheating (37:35 - 37:42)
i don't think anyone cheated oh (37:38 - 37:46)
really not that i know of i i i won 27 (37:42 - 37:47)
matches i lost 18. (37:46 - 37:50)
uh i did the math if i would have if i (37:47 - 37:54)
would have not lost (37:50 - 37:56)
what's the right words if i would have (37:54 - 37:57)
won 29 (37:56 - 38:00)
and lost 16 so two losses (37:57 - 38:04)
mattered because normally you get like (38:00 - 38:06)
either lose anywhere between like 10 to (38:04 - 38:07)
20 points (38:06 - 38:10)
per win or loss so if i if i if i got (38:07 - 38:13)
the lowest amount of points per win (38:10 - 38:15)
and those weren't losses i would have (38:13 - 38:17)
saved 20 points and gained 20 points (38:15 - 38:19)
which would have put me at 16.50 (38:17 - 38:21)
i thought my first day on stream was (38:19 - 38:22)
went really well (38:21 - 38:26)
and then i played saturday night and (38:22 - 38:31)
i should have probably taken more breaks (38:26 - 38:33)
in between matches well i know it's hard (38:31 - 38:35)
when you're so excited (38:33 - 38:38)
yeah it's it's like a nerve thing too (38:35 - 38:41)
and i i had the same nerve thing at like (38:38 - 38:42)
uh (38:41 - 38:43)
you know when we played in-game (38:42 - 38:45)
tournaments will where you're just like (38:43 - 38:47)
i just want the match to start (38:45 - 38:48)
instead of just like sitting there (38:47 - 38:50)
waiting i mean i enjoyed sitting there (38:48 - 38:52)
waiting quietly meditating on the (38:50 - 38:54)
pleasure that it is to be alive (38:52 - 38:56)
uh i had a good time i think i performed (38:54 - 38:58)
pretty okay i don't know i don't know i (38:56 - 38:59)
i guess i can't say i'm sure they'll do (38:58 - 39:00)
a player's cup four (38:59 - 39:02)
i don't see why they wouldn't seems to (39:00 - 39:04)
be oh i mean (39:02 - 39:05)
seems to they probably will yeah it (39:04 - 39:07)
seems to be doing really well for them (39:05 - 39:09)
you were a whole bucket of emotions (39:07 - 39:11)
watching when i was watching (39:09 - 39:14)
good emotions or bad emotions yes the (39:11 - 39:15)
okay yeah (39:14 - 39:18)
i mean if i know anything from history (39:15 - 39:21)
you just get too tied up in (39:18 - 39:24)
the whole thing when you when you were (39:21 - 39:24)
winning if (39:24 - 39:27)
you were you were at the highest highs (39:24 - 39:29)
and then i could always tell your silent (39:27 - 39:30)
rage when (39:29 - 39:32)
things are going bad because you get (39:30 - 39:33)
that (39:32 - 39:36)
you get that death look in your eyes (39:33 - 39:36)
that dead (39:36 - 39:40)
seriousness of and turn this around (39:36 - 39:42)
i i'm not a player that likes to do hard (39:40 - 39:44)
reads (39:42 - 39:46)
where it's like you know they have a (39:44 - 39:47)
really boom in front of me (39:46 - 39:50)
and and i have a blastoise out so like (39:47 - 39:52)
there's no reason for them to switch (39:50 - 39:53)
because they have like the (39:52 - 39:55)
obvious advantage there so my best move (39:53 - 39:57)
is to like hail storm into the (39:55 - 40:00)
into the rilaboom but i i could be like (39:57 - 40:00)
well (40:00 - 40:02)
i think they're going to switch to (40:00 - 40:04)
incineroar which (40:02 - 40:07)
would not take damage from the hail (40:04 - 40:08)
storm but also (40:07 - 40:10)
you don't bring an incineroar out in (40:08 - 40:11)
front of a (40:10 - 40:13)
gigantomax blastoise and i think that (40:11 - 40:15)
maybe you don't (40:13 - 40:19)
yeah you're not playing seven chess (40:15 - 40:21)
like really boom still survives the the (40:19 - 40:22)
hailstorm (40:21 - 40:26)
there were a lot of last night (40:22 - 40:27)
saturday night there were like every (40:26 - 40:29)
opponent i played just felt like they (40:27 - 40:31)
were just doing hard reads left and (40:29 - 40:32)
right and it (40:31 - 40:34)
it did get the they did get them the (40:32 - 40:36)
wins i i (40:34 - 40:39)
play more safe but (40:36 - 40:42)
in the best of one sometimes you just (40:39 - 40:44)
need one or two hard reads to (40:42 - 40:46)
yeah get the momentum because you don't (40:44 - 40:47)
have a way to (40:46 - 40:48)
it's not like i'm gonna rematch them (40:47 - 40:49)
right it's not like a best out of three (40:48 - 40:51)
where like it's like okay now i know (40:49 - 40:53)
that this pokemon has (40:51 - 40:55)
right a life orb where i didn't know (40:53 - 40:56)
that before (40:55 - 40:58)
so but overall you enjoyed your (40:56 - 40:59)
experience yeah (40:58 - 41:01)
yeah yeah i wish i had more time with (40:59 - 41:04)
the team uh i played um (41:01 - 41:09)
i played like a salamance porygon (41:04 - 41:12)
team on stream for like the last two (41:09 - 41:13)
months (41:12 - 41:15)
and that was like making changes to the (41:13 - 41:17)
pokemon it was pretty much the same team (41:15 - 41:19)
for two months (41:17 - 41:21)
uh and then last minute i decided to (41:19 - 41:22)
change the team (41:21 - 41:25)
so i only had will knows this where we (41:22 - 41:26)
we would change decks the night before a (41:25 - 41:28)
tournament (41:26 - 41:30)
that's the biggest mistake you can make (41:28 - 41:31)
buddy (41:30 - 41:34)
no i i i think changing the team was the (41:31 - 41:36)
correct decision i i like the team more (41:34 - 41:38)
i had fun playing the team (41:36 - 41:41)
but i switched to a blastoise dragopalt (41:38 - 41:43)
team like two days before and i (41:41 - 41:45)
only had two days of practice but i (41:43 - 41:47)
think i did pretty okay with it just (41:45 - 41:48)
bummed that i (41:47 - 41:49)
that i didn't qualify but that's okay (41:48 - 41:51)
they'll be next time one less thing to (41:49 - 41:54)
put on my linkedin profile (41:51 - 41:56)
and i've been checking i'll have you (41:54 - 41:57)
know (41:56 - 42:00)

biggest names in music (43:43 - 43:47)
from rising stars to award-winning (43:44 - 43:49)
global superstars for his program titled (43:47 - 43:51)
p25 music (43:49 - 43:54)
pop icon katy perry was revealed today (43:51 - 43:55)
as the premier (43:54 - 43:58)
collaborator in the massive year-long (43:55 - 43:58)
music (43:58 - 44:01)
campaign so is this like instead of us (43:58 - 44:02)
getting like a year of mythical (44:01 - 44:05)
or like a year of legendary we're just (44:02 - 44:06)
gonna get like one new (44:05 - 44:08)
song a month no i don't think that this (44:06 - 44:11)
is an instead (44:08 - 44:13)
this is just one of the many features (44:11 - 44:15)
somebody will be providing us (44:13 - 44:17)
it's a it's a puzzle so you have to (44:15 - 44:19)
decode the code in every song (44:17 - 44:21)
but so you can actually put that into (44:19 - 44:22)
your switch (44:21 - 44:24)
and then you will unlock something but (44:22 - 44:27)
if you don't listen and buy the song (44:24 - 44:30)
and then figure out the code you won't (44:27 - 44:31)
get it no one buys (44:30 - 44:34)
songs anymore excuse they just have (44:31 - 44:35)
their (44:34 - 44:38)
apple music or spotify or if what's that (44:35 - 44:39)
other one (44:38 - 44:41)
i believe there's one nick burgess out (44:39 - 44:43)
there that has received cash for me at (44:41 - 44:45)
least twice in the past five years (44:43 - 44:49)
i buy from artists because (44:45 - 44:51)
streaming services don't really pay them (44:49 - 44:53)
and if i really like it (44:51 - 44:55)
i will pay them the money they deserve (44:53 - 44:58)
for the product that they (44:55 - 45:01)
made so i will buy it even though i may (44:58 - 45:04)
listen to it on spotify i will buy their (45:01 - 45:04)
music (45:04 - 45:08)
from them the most direct way that i can (45:04 - 45:09)
because if i'm really enjoying it they (45:08 - 45:12)
should get paid and they should get paid (45:09 - 45:15)
fairly this is the basis of a lawsuit (45:12 - 45:17)
happening right now against you music (45:15 - 45:18)
artists get like (45:17 - 45:21)
a dollar from like a 10 like (45:18 - 45:24)
they don't this is the whole point of (45:21 - 45:25)
umg (45:24 - 45:28)
like what is umg universal music group (45:25 - 45:30)
oh whatever you're i i don't know what (45:28 - 45:31)
you're talking about with that thing the (45:30 - 45:34)
whole issue when it boils down to (45:31 - 45:36)
dollars to doughnuts streaming they get (45:34 - 45:39)
like a tenth of a penny per stream (45:36 - 45:41)
versus if you buy the music then they (45:39 - 45:42)
get like (45:41 - 45:45)
at least 10 of the cost yeah they get (45:42 - 45:48)
like ten pennies instead of one penny (45:45 - 45:49)
ten pennies is still better than they (45:48 - 45:51)
are penny exactly (45:49 - 45:54)
that's how math works ten times more and (45:51 - 45:55)
i'm giving them (45:54 - 45:59)
that on top of the money from streaming (45:55 - 46:00)
the only the only people who wins here (45:59 - 46:02)
are umg (46:00 - 46:05)
universal music group yes okay katy (46:02 - 46:08)
perry has a quote here (46:05 - 46:10)
pokemon has been a constant in my life (46:08 - 46:11)
from playing the original video games on (46:10 - 46:12)
my game boy (46:11 - 46:15)
to trading pokemon tcg cards at lunch to (46:12 - 46:17)
the adventures of catching (46:15 - 46:19)
pokemon on the streets in pokemon go (46:17 - 46:21)
i've even visited the pokemon cafe in (46:19 - 46:23)
japan while on tour it was an honor to (46:21 - 46:24)
be chosen to help (46:23 - 46:26)
celebrate a franchise that has given me (46:24 - 46:27)
much joy (46:26 - 46:30)
in the last 25 years and to be able to (46:27 - 46:31)
watch it all evolve (46:30 - 46:33)
in the ways it has provided a kind of (46:31 - 46:35)
electric joy for (46:33 - 46:37)
kids in my life and around the world (46:35 - 46:38)
said katy perry (46:37 - 46:41)
so one thing i'm happy to kind of get a (46:38 - 46:42)
clarification on is (46:41 - 46:46)
i was concerned that like katy perry was (46:42 - 46:47)
the only (46:46 - 46:50)
musical component of this whole thing (46:47 - 46:52)
and to find out that there will be other (46:50 - 46:54)
artists featured i mean i like i do (46:52 - 46:55)
enjoy the occasional katy perry although (46:54 - 46:57)
you know problematic in (46:55 - 47:01)
certain areas um but yeah just to know (46:57 - 47:01)
that (47:01 - 47:03)
other artists will also be featured that (47:01 - 47:05)
that makes me happy (47:03 - 47:08)
i'm not in the music scene like you two (47:05 - 47:09)
are (47:08 - 47:12)
yeah you don't like music but yeah i i (47:09 - 47:14)
hate everything that brings joy (47:12 - 47:16)
i mean he he bought that lord album (47:14 - 47:18)
seven years ago or eight years ago (47:16 - 47:20)
yeah yeah i saw it on his record player (47:18 - 47:21)
that one time i (47:20 - 47:25)
i do have a record player i do have i do (47:21 - 47:25)
have (47:25 - 47:28)
records of music one being are you a (47:25 - 47:29)
vinyl hipster (47:28 - 47:32)
uh at one point in my life look i wore a (47:29 - 47:33)
chain wallet (47:32 - 47:36)
at one point in my life i have a record (47:33 - 47:37)
player (47:36 - 47:40)
i shopped at uh urbana (47:37 - 47:42)
every once in a while i forget how basic (47:40 - 47:44)
you are and then (47:42 - 47:45)
you come rushing back into the (47:44 - 47:47)
conversation earlier not (47:45 - 47:51)
describe like paint that picture clearly (47:47 - 47:53)
i mean i try to think that i've made (47:51 - 47:55)
better choices with my friends in my (47:53 - 47:55)
life (47:55 - 47:57)
and you're here to prove me wrong i (47:55 - 47:59)
literally had the (47:57 - 48:01)
memory this morning i was like walking i (47:59 - 48:03)
had just gone to target i was walking to (48:01 - 48:05)
the elevator from my car and literally (48:03 - 48:06)
the thought came through (48:05 - 48:08)
my head of i remember when steve used to (48:06 - 48:10)
only wear supras (48:08 - 48:12)
but it's like that was the only shoes (48:10 - 48:15)
that he would buy was supras (48:12 - 48:18)
as so as a music person yes (48:15 - 48:21)
as as an owner of uh katy perry teenage (48:18 - 48:22)
dream on vinyl (48:21 - 48:25)
okay this is this is actually my point (48:22 - 48:27)
if they're saying katy perry is (48:25 - 48:30)
headlining that means no artist bigger (48:27 - 48:30)
than (48:30 - 48:33)
katy perry can be on whatever they're (48:30 - 48:34)
doing this year (48:33 - 48:37)
uh that's open to interpretation they (48:34 - 48:39)
may be saying headlining just because (48:37 - 48:41)
she's the first featured artist (48:39 - 48:43)
okay while other ones will be coming (48:41 - 48:45)
later but like she's the headliner (48:43 - 48:46)
because she's (48:45 - 48:48)
first not because she's greatest and (48:46 - 48:51)
most powerful okay (48:48 - 48:55)
headlining general means they are the (48:51 - 48:55)
main (48:55 - 49:00)
act but that that doesn't mean like (48:55 - 49:02)
that somebody that you would consider (49:00 - 49:04)
more famous than her won't also be (49:02 - 49:05)
included (49:04 - 49:09)
is that she's the main focus of (49:05 - 49:12)
of what they're doing uh and she may (49:09 - 49:14)
have had a big role in selecting the (49:12 - 49:14)
artists (49:14 - 49:18)
that were a part of this collaboration (49:14 - 49:21)
but if it's if it's umg universal music (49:18 - 49:21)
group (49:21 - 49:25)
if remember we are talking international (49:21 - 49:28)
not universal no but it says there it (49:25 - 49:29)
says pokemon is working with (49:28 - 49:32)
umg specifically so does that mean the (49:29 - 49:34)
other artists have to be also signed a (49:32 - 49:36)
umg like katy perry is (49:34 - 49:38)
probably most likely yes yeah so we're (49:36 - 49:42)
not going to see any bts (49:38 - 49:42)
unless they do something (49:42 - 49:48)
like you can sign agreements to out but (49:45 - 49:49)
probably not because they don't want to (49:48 - 49:50)
pay that money (49:49 - 49:53)
but you know there could be a taylor (49:50 - 49:54)
swift (49:53 - 49:57)
a lady gaga on there i'm assuming those (49:54 - 49:58)
are umg (49:57 - 50:02)
yeah a mariah carey could be on there (49:58 - 50:05)
ooh do you think they were for christmas (50:02 - 50:06)
is pokemon do you think they bring back (50:05 - 50:08)
m2m (50:06 - 50:11)
was m2m on uh umg (50:08 - 50:14)
i've never even heard of this group what (50:11 - 50:16)
m2m did the mewtwo (50:14 - 50:20)
movie song well weren't they norwegian (50:16 - 50:23)
were they uh yeah i think they were from (50:20 - 50:26)
somewhere in europe oh they were emi (50:23 - 50:30)
and uh what was the other one (50:26 - 50:34)
emi and atlantic so i don't think so (50:30 - 50:36)
no colin palmer vice president of (50:34 - 50:38)
marketing at pokemon company (50:36 - 50:39)
international says (50:38 - 50:42)
in katy perry we see a kindred spirit to (50:39 - 50:44)
pokemon whose world is bright fun and (50:42 - 50:44)
unlit (50:44 - 50:47)
uh uplifting katy perry is a wonderful (50:44 - 50:48)
ambassador (50:47 - 50:51)
to help us celebrate 25 years of pokemon (50:48 - 50:52)
and we can't wait for music fans (50:51 - 50:54)
everywhere to experience the (50:52 - 50:56)
collaborations we have planned (50:54 - 51:00)
and then lj guu (50:56 - 51:04)
rez general manager of umg (51:00 - 51:07)
according to just as a breaking breaking (51:04 - 51:09)
news i'm looking at wikipedia and i do (51:07 - 51:11)
not know how i accurate this but list of (51:09 - 51:12)
universal music group (51:11 - 51:15)
artists under b (51:12 - 51:19)
is bts south korea well well (51:15 - 51:21)
well interesting i know bts has signed a (51:19 - 51:24)
big hit i believe is their label brain (51:21 - 51:27)
also butthole surfaces are there so i'm (51:24 - 51:28)
looking for their song (51:27 - 51:31)
they haven't been good since 1993. this (51:28 - 51:33)
could be their comeback (51:31 - 51:35)
frankie ghosa hollywood is on this list (51:33 - 51:37)
i'm waiting for that comeback (51:35 - 51:40)
this could be the greatest pokemon album (51:37 - 51:41)
ever but (51:40 - 51:44)
also remember like universal is a (51:41 - 51:47)
is like that the high level i'm (51:44 - 51:49)
i'm gesturing with my hand which you (51:47 - 51:51)
cannot see universals at the top (51:49 - 51:54)
they have many subdivision labels under (51:51 - 51:55)
them (51:54 - 51:58)
so the label that bts is on could be a (51:55 - 51:59)
subdivision of (51:58 - 52:02)
universal music group that's the group (51:59 - 52:03)
part (52:02 - 52:04)
we're honored to celebrate the 25th (52:03 - 52:07)

merchandise i bought the (56:08 - 56:12)
two athletic pikachu tank tops that are (56:09 - 56:13)
available from (56:12 - 56:15)
pokemon center i have worn them both to (56:13 - 56:16)
the gym (56:15 - 56:18)
nobody commented on either one but they (56:16 - 56:19)
were very comfortable (56:18 - 56:22)
i'm gonna buy that the dark one is much (56:19 - 56:23)
more comfortable (56:22 - 56:25)
you think togepi lover would like them (56:23 - 56:26)
oh absolutely (56:25 - 56:29)
oh absolutely more if there was togepi (56:26 - 56:30)
on them but (56:29 - 56:33)
how long do you think it's been how long (56:30 - 56:34)
have we heard since we've heard from (56:33 - 56:37)
togepi lover (56:34 - 56:39)
too long too long i'm concerned for (56:37 - 56:41)
their health uh more celebrations along (56:39 - 56:43)
the way the details are (56:41 - 56:44)
just a glimpse of what the world can (56:43 - 56:47)
expect in 2021 with the 25th anniversary (56:44 - 56:50)
uh activations plan for animation video (56:47 - 56:51)
games (56:50 - 56:54)
mobile games including go and masters e (56:51 - 56:55)
x (56:54 - 56:57)
uh and more big announcements from the (56:55 - 56:59)
franchise fans will have a (56:57 - 57:02)
year full of new journeys ahead (56:59 - 57:04)
maybe we'll talk about this next week (57:02 - 57:07)
but there is somebody broke their nda (57:04 - 57:10)
for pokemon unite there are (57:07 - 57:13)
there's oh yeah there is cinderease in a (57:10 - 57:15)
you know pirate costume there is machamp (57:13 - 57:18)
wearing subspenders there's (57:15 - 57:19)
[Music] (57:18 - 57:23)
nothing surprising for a moba cause like (57:19 - 57:27)
in like dota and like league of legends (57:23 - 57:29)
you buy like hats and stuff (57:27 - 57:30)
like that's very common in those games (57:29 - 57:32)
you buy skins yeah don't (57:30 - 57:35)
buy articles of clothing skins get your (57:32 - 57:35)
wins (57:35 - 57:37)
isn't donut just hats though i thought (57:35 - 57:39)
dota was hats i don't know anything (57:37 - 57:41)
about dota except (57:39 - 57:43)
my friends that play it i don't pay that (57:41 - 57:45)
much attention but i know in league it's (57:43 - 57:46)
all about the skins (57:45 - 57:47)
are you sure you're not thinking of (57:46 - 57:50)
fortnite oh no fortnite is for sure (57:47 - 57:51)
skins (57:50 - 57:54)
i think dota's hats right i'm going to (57:51 - 57:54)
search (57:54 - 57:58)
on the internet is dota hats that is (57:54 - 58:01)
kind of yes okay so (57:58 - 58:03)
now this does make sense because in dota (58:01 - 58:05)
you don't have like specific champions (58:03 - 58:07)
that you own there's a drafting system (58:05 - 58:08)
at the beginning of the competition so (58:07 - 58:10)
then you might want to put your hat (58:08 - 58:12)
on the particular one that you draft (58:10 - 58:14)
that makes sense but wait no no no i've (58:12 - 58:16)
seen skins because (58:14 - 58:18)
that glowing blue ball you can skin it (58:16 - 58:19)
as a (58:18 - 58:23)
companion cube from portal so (58:19 - 58:26)
i think you can only see that though no (58:23 - 58:28)
it was on the world championships oh (58:26 - 58:29)
because i thought (58:28 - 58:32)
dota also had voice packs where oh (58:29 - 58:36)
definitely yes you can hear yes (58:32 - 58:38)
you can i have heard the rick and morty (58:36 - 58:39)
voice pack (58:38 - 58:41)
more times than i've ever wanted to in (58:39 - 58:43)
my entire life (58:41 - 58:47)
but if you watch the whole uh (58:43 - 58:49)
the documentary about the world (58:47 - 58:50)
championships where it was like (58:49 - 58:52)
the one guy was friends with the other (58:50 - 58:54)
guy and they had a team and then (58:52 - 58:56)
the one guy betrayed his friend and (58:54 - 58:57)
formed a new team but didn't invite his (58:56 - 58:59)
friend and then his friend created his (58:57 - 59:00)
own team (58:59 - 59:02)
and then they like recruited all these (59:00 - 59:03)
people who were no (59:02 - 59:05)
like unknowns and then came back and won (59:03 - 59:06)
the whole thing and then like won it for (59:05 - 59:07)
a couple of years that (59:06 - 59:09)
they had a skin on the little blue glowy (59:07 - 59:11)
ball so there you go there's your answer (59:09 - 59:13)
i kind of want to get the skateboard (59:11 - 59:14)
will (59:13 - 59:17)
dude get in line because it's (59:14 - 59:19)
to be there's going to be a rush on (59:17 - 59:20)
those skateboards so (59:19 - 59:22)
well the skateboards have all sold out (59:20 - 59:24)
within like an hour of being posted (59:22 - 59:27)
but if i was an hour buddy within five (59:24 - 59:29)
minutes of being posted if i was to get (59:27 - 59:31)
if i was to get any skateboard i feel (59:29 - 59:33)
like getting the 25th anniversary (59:31 - 59:35)
skateboard is the one to get (59:33 - 59:37)
i that would be fantastic but i don't (59:35 - 59:38)
feel like i mean (59:37 - 59:40)
maybe i'll roll the dice unfortunately (59:38 - 59:42)
it's a tuesday so that's going to be (59:40 - 59:43)
hard to do (59:42 - 59:46)
but i you know i will say (59:43 - 59:49)
when i shipped my toxicity board from (59:46 - 59:51)
south carolina to (59:49 - 59:54)
minnesota that i (59:51 - 59:55)
that when they asked like how much do (59:54 - 59:57)
you want to insure this package for and (59:55 - 59:59)
i looked i was like how much is this (59:57 - 60:01)
silly toxicity board going for on ebay (59:59 - 60:03)
it was 350 dollars (60:01 - 60:06)
wow i buy two skateboards i flip one of (60:03 - 60:08)
them (60:06 - 60:08)
the flipping pays for the initial (60:09 - 60:14)
skateboard (60:13 - 60:17)
if you do that i will buy myself a can (60:14 - 60:19)
of lima beans and end it all (60:17 - 60:22)
right here (60:19 - 60:22)
you will know it's over by me posting (60:24 - 60:27)
that horrible quote (60:26 - 60:31)
alolan vulpix quote picture as our group (60:27 - 60:33)
chat (60:31 - 60:33)
uh i don't think i can budget a 250 i'm (60:33 - 60:38)
assuming it's 250. (60:36 - 60:42)
oh they're 150. are they 150. (60:38 - 60:45)
yeah 150 is a little easier to swallow (60:42 - 60:46)
than 250. (60:45 - 60:49)
it's a hundred dollars just you to (60:46 - 60:51)
swallow (60:49 - 60:55)
okay they also announced (60:51 - 60:57)

has been for a long time (63:21 - 63:27)
i mean must much of english (63:23 - 63:29)

a perfect (63:37 - 63:41)
moment that you may gain a higher score (63:37 - 63:45)
professor muir will evaluate scores (63:41 - 63:47)
pokemon photography is evaluated based (63:45 - 63:48)
on subjects poses (63:47 - 63:51)
how large they appear how directly they (63:48 - 63:52)
are in the camera (63:51 - 63:55)
and if they will fall into frame as (63:52 - 63:56)
players take more photos to fulfill (63:55 - 63:58)
their research they may see pokemon look (63:56 - 64:01)
and behave in entirely new ways (63:58 - 64:04)
pokemon will have two players will have (64:01 - 64:06)
to take many photos to use the highest (64:04 - 64:08)
scores to fill out their photo decks the (64:06 - 64:10)
untouched depths of the lentil region (64:08 - 64:11)
may sound (64:10 - 64:13)
daunting at first but don't worry (64:11 - 64:15)
explorers will hop into the neo1 (64:13 - 64:17)
an auto driving vehicle that will steer (64:15 - 64:19)
them across various paths on each island (64:17 - 64:21)
so they can free up time to focus on (64:19 - 64:23)
snapping the perfect shots (64:21 - 64:24)
throughout your missions you may even (64:23 - 64:26)
get to see pokemon looking and behaving (64:24 - 64:27)
differently than before (64:26 - 64:29)
these special moments are memories to (64:27 - 64:31)
savior so if you're lucky (64:29 - 64:33)
you'll always have your trusty camera on (64:31 - 64:34)
hand to caption capture (64:33 - 64:37)
those pokemon some pokemon and (64:34 - 64:38)
vegetation (64:37 - 64:39)
that players will discover will also (64:38 - 64:41)
have a special glow (64:39 - 64:43)
these strange occurrences are only found (64:41 - 64:44)
in the lentil region and (64:43 - 64:48)
are known as illumina the alumina (64:44 - 64:49)
phenomenon (64:48 - 64:51)
jump into the trusty neo one to uncover (64:49 - 64:54)
the mystery behind the illuminati (64:51 - 64:56)
phenomenon (64:54 - 64:57)
and that's uh that's it that's the press (64:56 - 64:59)
release oh (64:57 - 65:02)
okay there was a lot there but uh i'm (64:59 - 65:03)
assuming you both saw the trailer (65:02 - 65:06)
and i'm assuming you both have thoughts (65:03 - 65:08)
greg you can go on this one (65:06 - 65:09)
i mean i'm excited for it i mean there (65:08 - 65:12)
was nothing i don't think they showed (65:09 - 65:14)
anything (65:12 - 65:17)
apart from the giant light up meganium (65:14 - 65:20)
that felt a lot different than (65:17 - 65:25)
the regular snap like the old timey snap (65:20 - 65:28)
um which is fine i i don't think they (65:25 - 65:29)
gave (65:28 - 65:33)
a whole lot away uh but i liked (65:29 - 65:35)
everything that i saw i'm excited for it (65:33 - 65:38)
so my only issue with i can't say my (65:35 - 65:38)
only issue (65:38 - 65:42)
my issue with pokemon snap (65:38 - 65:44)
is when i played the first one on my (65:42 - 65:46)
nintendo 64 (65:44 - 65:50)
i was not a kid right (65:46 - 65:53)
it just really did not appeal to me at (65:50 - 65:54)
all (65:53 - 65:56)
i i got very little pleasure out of it (65:54 - 65:57)
and (65:56 - 66:00)
so there's like no nostalgia tick for me (65:57 - 66:02)
on this particular game (66:00 - 66:05)
and then just the gameplay i'll have to (66:02 - 66:06)
see it to believe it i'm just i (66:05 - 66:08)
i can't get excited if it's going to be (66:06 - 66:10)
a reflection of what the past pokemon (66:08 - 66:11)
snap was (66:10 - 66:14)
i think there's a lot of nostalgia (66:11 - 66:15)
around pokemon snap (66:14 - 66:18)
people remember it being like for other (66:15 - 66:19)
people yes (66:18 - 66:21)
sure i mean i have nostalgia about i (66:19 - 66:23)
mean i enjoyed the game (66:21 - 66:26)
when i played it but again my you know (66:23 - 66:29)
i was my nostalgia of it like i knew it (66:26 - 66:29)
was (66:29 - 66:32)
not you know it wasn't like this super (66:29 - 66:33)
great game that i played all the time (66:32 - 66:34)
but (66:33 - 66:37)
i mean it was just at the time it was (66:34 - 66:37)
another (66:37 - 66:40)
pokemon product that i wanted to play (66:37 - 66:41)
and (66:40 - 66:43)
i could see that the game was just a (66:41 - 66:45)
very basic (66:43 - 66:47)
loader like you're gonna go along this (66:45 - 66:48)
path and take pictures and then slowly (66:47 - 66:49)
unlock things (66:48 - 66:52)
and it was a very short game and i don't (66:49 - 66:53)
really expect (66:52 - 66:56)
much more out of this game right like it (66:53 - 66:58)
didn't show anything (66:56 - 67:00)
more out of this particular game it was (66:58 - 67:01)
just like okay you're gonna (67:00 - 67:04)
be on the exact same track taking (67:01 - 67:05)
pictures and you'll (67:04 - 67:07)
like you'll have to repeat places (67:05 - 67:08)
because you'll once again like the first (67:07 - 67:09)
one (67:08 - 67:12)
get new items to make them do (67:09 - 67:15)
new things and you still will never (67:12 - 67:15)
understand (67:15 - 67:18)
what criteria it actually uses to give (67:15 - 67:19)
you a good (67:18 - 67:22)
picture oh it's just randomized (67:19 - 67:25)
i'm sure calculations will be better (67:22 - 67:26)
this time (67:25 - 67:29)
the only thing i feel a little (67:26 - 67:32)
uneasy about is is it (67:29 - 67:35)
given how small the first one (67:32 - 67:40)
felt felt like it was pushing the price (67:35 - 67:43)
limit this is 60 dollars (67:40 - 67:46)
that feels a lot for how limited the (67:43 - 67:48)
very first pokemon snap was (67:46 - 67:52)
so i'm very curious how many (67:48 - 67:55)
pokemon are in it how many areas are in (67:52 - 67:58)
it yeah (67:55 - 68:01)
exactly i mean it's a tough sell (67:58 - 68:03)
yeah i mean i'll still buy it i still (68:01 - 68:04)
think i can get enjoyment out of it i (68:03 - 68:08)
i am really questioning (68:04 - 68:11)
the cost that's sort of my my major like (68:08 - 68:13)
is this (68:11 - 68:15)
is it going to look pretty enough to be (68:13 - 68:16)
worth 60 and i (68:15 - 68:19)
i don't have that sense yet i i'm (68:16 - 68:20)
leaning towards (68:19 - 68:23)
no so i i have a lot of thoughts uh they (68:20 - 68:24)
did say (68:23 - 68:28)
on there's newpokemonsnap.pokemon.com (68:24 - 68:30)
is a website yeah they do say there are (68:28 - 68:33)
over 200 pokemon which means (68:30 - 68:36)
uh like 207 right (68:33 - 68:38)
yeah like if there was 250 pokemon they (68:36 - 68:40)
would say over 250 pokemon (68:38 - 68:42)
if there was a even if there was 220 i (68:40 - 68:43)
feel like they would probably say (68:42 - 68:46)
there's over 220 pokemon but it's (68:43 - 68:49)
probably like 205 204 pokemon uh (68:46 - 68:52)
that in itself yeah explore beaches (68:49 - 68:54)
jungles deserts and more as you (68:52 - 68:55)
photograph over 200 pokemon and (68:54 - 68:57)
investigate the mysterious (68:55 - 68:59)
illumina phenomenon in the new pokemons (68:57 - 69:01)
now i think that number is (68:59 - 69:06)
low yep the first game had 63 pokemon (69:01 - 69:09)
it was supposed to have 64 pokemon the (69:06 - 69:10)
pokemon that was cut (69:09 - 69:13)
last minute was ekans uh (69:10 - 69:15)
because i can't remember exactly why it (69:13 - 69:17)
was cut but it was supposed to be (69:15 - 69:20)
nintendo 64. there if you if you (69:17 - 69:23)
are too young to remember nintendo 64 (69:20 - 69:25)
games every game had this (69:23 - 69:29)
ongoing thing of like we have to have (69:25 - 69:33)
a 64 reference somewhere in our game (69:29 - 69:35)
for a pokemon snap it was like well it's (69:33 - 69:37)
64 pokemon that moving (69:35 - 69:39)
around the environment but they had to (69:37 - 69:41)
cut atkins last minute so it was only 63 (69:39 - 69:42)
pokemon (69:41 - 69:45)
uh which at the time that's (69:42 - 69:48)
like over one-third of the pokedex and (69:45 - 69:50)
in this case (69:48 - 69:52)
i guess it's like one-fourth of the (69:50 - 69:54)
pokedex (69:52 - 69:58)
yeah just about just about but i (69:54 - 70:00)
200 pokemon is a good amount don't get (69:58 - 70:01)
me wrong (70:00 - 70:04)
yeah going with what i agree with greg (70:01 - 70:05)
about (70:04 - 70:09)
is a 60 dollar game (70:05 - 70:11)
for 200 pokemon this is this is yeah (70:09 - 70:12)
this is like the (70:11 - 70:15)
the theme of pokemon now is just like (70:12 - 70:15)
how (70:15 - 70:18)
how many pokemon can we cut out and (70:15 - 70:20)
still sell them again (70:18 - 70:22)
like can we get the can we get them to (70:20 - 70:24)
pay 60 for a five pokemon game (70:22 - 70:26)
let's see if we can do it those suckers (70:24 - 70:29)
will buy anything (70:26 - 70:32)
quit now frauds yeah quit now frauds (70:29 - 70:34)
like that i think we argued about this a (70:32 - 70:36)
year ago i think i think (70:34 - 70:38)
uh will didn't believe this was going to (70:36 - 70:40)
be a 60 game and i (70:38 - 70:42)
pretty much said on this podcast the (70:40 - 70:44)
pokemon tax will make it a sixty dollar (70:42 - 70:44)
game (70:44 - 70:46)
because they can get away with sounds (70:44 - 70:48)
like me yeah it sounds like yes (70:46 - 70:50)
um so he's like do you remember original (70:48 - 70:51)
pokemon snap (70:50 - 70:54)
that wasn't a sixty dollar game i think (70:51 - 70:56)
original pokemon snap was the full price (70:54 - 70:58)
of a 16 nintendo 64 game which was (70:56 - 71:00)
yes absolutely forty nine dollars i (70:58 - 71:02)
think right 50 bucks (71:00 - 71:04)
was nintendo 64 games around that very (71:02 - 71:05)
expensive (71:04 - 71:07)
okay so this is this sounds like more (71:05 - 71:09)
than i think they were (71:07 - 71:11)
were they 40 or were they 50 i would say (71:09 - 71:13)
they were 40. (71:11 - 71:15)
they might have been 40. yeah you're (71:13 - 71:16)
right greg they might have been 40 (71:15 - 71:18)
because i think gamecube was when they (71:16 - 71:20)
bumped it to 50. (71:18 - 71:23)
yeah and then we they kept it at 50 and (71:20 - 71:25)
then switch they jumped it to 60. (71:23 - 71:27)
because they made a big deal about that (71:25 - 71:29)
yep again maybe (71:27 - 71:31)
maybe some adults don't remember their (71:29 - 71:33)
pokemon snap days as well as i do (71:31 - 71:35)
i've played pokemon snap probably once a (71:33 - 71:37)
year and i think (71:35 - 71:40)
that game does out of all the nintendo (71:37 - 71:42)
64 games i do think pokemon snap holds (71:40 - 71:42)
up (71:42 - 71:43)
i do think i i do i want to be very (71:42 - 71:46)
clear that i like pokemon snap (71:43 - 71:48)
i think it's i think it is an enjoyable (71:46 - 71:50)
afternoon (71:48 - 71:53)
once a year to sit down with a friend or (71:50 - 71:54)
a nephew (71:53 - 71:56)
or your significant other and to play (71:54 - 71:57)
pokemon snap together (71:56 - 72:00)
i think for what that game is it (71:57 - 72:01)
captures that but (72:00 - 72:04)
but beyond that uh i don't think pokemon (72:01 - 72:05)
snap (72:04 - 72:09)
was the game that was worth the (72:05 - 72:11)
full price back then and i think they (72:09 - 72:12)
knew that (72:11 - 72:15)
and the reason i'm the reason they knew (72:12 - 72:16)
that is because (72:15 - 72:18)
they specifically partnered with best or (72:16 - 72:20)
with blockbuster (72:18 - 72:22)
they put the kiosk in the store because (72:20 - 72:24)
they knew (72:22 - 72:27)
that people would rent this game yep and (72:24 - 72:28)
that this game was (72:27 - 72:32)
perfect for rentals because (72:28 - 72:35)
when you owned it you realized all the (72:32 - 72:37)
flaws (72:35 - 72:39)
yeah absolutely and uh no lie i actually (72:37 - 72:41)
rented this game from a video store not (72:39 - 72:42)
blockbuster but (72:41 - 72:44)
i did i do it as a rental i think i (72:42 - 72:46)
returned it two days later (72:44 - 72:48)
i'm pretty sure i bought it i probably (72:46 - 72:50)
still have it somewhere in this house (72:48 - 72:52)
and so my worry all this time with (72:50 - 72:53)
pokemon snap (72:52 - 72:56)
was they knew back then that this game (72:53 - 72:58)
would be an amazing rental game (72:56 - 73:01)
and for and and it was it was a real (72:58 - 73:02)
like it was (73:01 - 73:04)
the thing that like if my parents were (73:02 - 73:06)
like we gotta run we gotta go to the (73:04 - 73:08)
grocery store and i'm like oh (73:06 - 73:09)
but we're gonna probably stop at (73:08 - 73:10)
blockbuster i was like oh gosh please (73:09 - 73:12)
take me i will suffer through two hours (73:10 - 73:14)
of grocery shopping to get like five (73:12 - 73:15)
minutes of (73:14 - 73:18)
playing the pokemon snap kiosk and maybe (73:15 - 73:19)
convincing you to spend the five dollars (73:18 - 73:21)
so we can rent this for 48 hours (73:19 - 73:24)
um it was the perfect rental game (73:21 - 73:25)
because (73:24 - 73:28)
it wasn't in my opinion a (73:25 - 73:30)
a game that should have been full price (73:28 - 73:33)
compared to other games so now you have (73:30 - 73:36)
a new pokemon snap at full price which (73:33 - 73:37)
is (73:36 - 73:39)
i guess three times the amount of (73:37 - 73:41)
content but (73:39 - 73:44)
64 like once you played through if you (73:41 - 73:46)
own pokemon snap (73:44 - 73:47)
you you were probably one of those (73:46 - 73:49)
players that could beat the entire game (73:47 - 73:50)
start to finish (73:49 - 73:54)
in like two hours yeah and so if this is (73:50 - 73:59)
if this ends up being six to eight hours (73:54 - 73:59)
maybe i guess and i'm not the type of (73:59 - 74:04)
person that's like (74:03 - 74:06)
i need x amount of time from a video (74:04 - 74:08)
game to make it worth it like i played (74:06 - 74:09)
gone home that's like a (74:08 - 74:11)
that's like an hour-long game it's like (74:09 - 74:13)
20 bucks (74:11 - 74:14)
loved it played firewatch that's like a (74:13 - 74:16)
four-hour game 20 bucks (74:14 - 74:19)
loved it you know uncharted one you get (74:16 - 74:21)
through that story like 12 hours 60 (74:19 - 74:22)
bucks (74:21 - 74:25)
loved it so i don't have a problem (74:22 - 74:30)
paying 60 for a short experience if that (74:25 - 74:31)
experience is good (74:30 - 74:34)
pokemon snap looks good but (74:31 - 74:37)
let's not kid ourselves that (74:34 - 74:40)
the original game they knew that it was (74:37 - 74:41)
short (74:40 - 74:44)
and they and it existed in a time (74:41 - 74:47)
where renting was a thing to do and it (74:44 - 74:49)
was a perfect rental game (74:47 - 74:52)
yeah which is my worry here there (74:49 - 74:55)
is a very unique and special shiny (74:52 - 74:57)
pokemon that can only be obtained by (74:55 - 75:00)
completing your pokey's pokemon's photo (74:57 - 75:01)
decks (75:00 - 75:03)
is that worth a sixty dollars what if it (75:01 - 75:06)
is another opportunity to get a shiny (75:03 - 75:06)
mew (75:06 - 75:10)
i mean maybe that knows a special move (75:06 - 75:12)
maybe or has a special hidden ability (75:10 - 75:15)
inability shiny mu if you're if (75:12 - 75:17)
well mythical pokemon don't have hidden (75:15 - 75:19)
abilities yet (75:17 - 75:22)
they will now they will now i (75:19 - 75:25)
don't think they need to attach a (75:22 - 75:26)
pokemon to this like they did (75:25 - 75:29)
ranger or coliseum because they have (75:26 - 75:31)
nostalgia working for them (75:29 - 75:34)
this is 25th anniversary all bets are (75:31 - 75:35)
off the table (75:34 - 75:37)
it's time to go wild they probably would (75:35 - 75:39)
have already said (75:37 - 75:40)
there there are a few people that are (75:39 - 75:42)
like (75:40 - 75:43)
ever since this game got announced there (75:42 - 75:44)
are a few people being like i hope there (75:43 - 75:46)
are shiny pokemon in it (75:44 - 75:48)
it doesn't matter the amount of people (75:46 - 75:49)
that would weigh (75:48 - 75:52)
60 on whether this game has shinies or (75:49 - 75:52)
not (75:52 - 75:55)
like that is that is such a (75:52 - 75:57)
significantly small portion of the (75:55 - 75:59)
audience and i even think (75:57 - 76:01)
if you already thought 60 was too much (75:59 - 76:02)
and they were like well you can maybe (76:01 - 76:04)
see a shiny pokemon i still (76:02 - 76:05)
maybe don't think you pull the trigger (76:04 - 76:06)
there's probably one person listening (76:05 - 76:08)
being like i'm only buying this game if (76:06 - 76:09)
they have shiny pokemon yeah but for (76:08 - 76:11)
like the general audience like (76:09 - 76:14)
ma or dad walking into the store the the (76:11 - 76:15)
the (76:14 - 76:16)
the main reason they're buying it is (76:15 - 76:18)
because it says pokemon uh and if you're (76:16 - 76:19)
an adult (76:18 - 76:22)
like like the three of us are you're (76:19 - 76:23)
either buying it or not whether or not (76:22 - 76:25)
they have shiny pokemon i think shiny (76:23 - 76:26)
pokemon would be okay (76:25 - 76:30)
i think it would add some replay (76:26 - 76:33)
just value to the game you just see the (76:30 - 76:34)
shiny pokemon (76:33 - 76:36)
it's you don't get to catch them they (76:34 - 76:38)
don't go into your pokemon home (76:36 - 76:40)
sure sure but it still adds some replay (76:38 - 76:41)
value but i think that's what the (76:40 - 76:42)
illuminati (76:41 - 76:46)
thing is um the illuminati's got a whole (76:42 - 76:49)
other bent on (76:46 - 76:49)
to talk about how the illuminati have (76:52 - 76:57)
infiltrated the pokemon universe (76:54 - 76:58)
i'm way more into this game now that (76:57 - 77:00)
they're illuminati in it uh (76:58 - 77:02)
it says lentil pokemon and their habits (77:00 - 77:04)
to uncover the truth about the illumina (77:02 - 77:06)
phenomenon so (77:04 - 77:08)
i i i think that like that is the (77:06 - 77:10)
special thing you're looking for you (77:08 - 77:11)
probably want to (77:10 - 77:14)
read i don't think i could be wrong (77:11 - 77:16)
but i don't think every time you go (77:14 - 77:18)
through the forest level (77:16 - 77:22)
you're going to see a shining glowing (77:18 - 77:22)
meganium (77:22 - 77:25)
i think that that is probably a rare (77:22 - 77:26)
occurrence (77:25 - 77:29)
and that is the reason you would replay (77:26 - 77:31)
through those levels (77:29 - 77:36)
oh yeah so do they need illuminati (77:31 - 77:39)
aluminum illumina (77:36 - 77:41)
do they need alumina and do they need (77:39 - 77:42)
shiny (77:41 - 77:45)
probably not because they're probably (77:42 - 77:46)
doing the same thing (77:45 - 77:49)
which is i have a chance to get a (77:46 - 77:52)
quote-unquote rarer picture (77:49 - 77:54)
going through i don't know if 300 (77:52 - 77:56)
pokemon like if they said 300 pokemon i (77:54 - 77:58)
think i would feel better about the 60 (77:56 - 78:00)
if they said 400 pokemon i think i'd (77:58 - 78:02)
feel really good (78:00 - 78:04)
yeah if they said 810 pokemon i'd feel (78:02 - 78:05)
great there (78:04 - 78:09)
there would be no way i mean (78:05 - 78:12)
i just can't help i just it's just so (78:09 - 78:14)
hard for me i'm excited for this game (78:12 - 78:15)
i'm going to play it on day one i'll (78:14 - 78:16)
spend the 60 (78:15 - 78:19)
that's not a problem i just can't help (78:16 - 78:24)
think how does this a game exist in 2021 (78:19 - 78:27)
and not disappoint people when the (78:24 - 78:29)
original game existed in a (78:27 - 78:33)
very specific time zone i mean there's a (78:29 - 78:33)
few (78:33 - 78:35)
like they're definitely relying on (78:33 - 78:37)
nostalgia zone (78:35 - 78:39)
like they're definitely relying on (78:37 - 78:40)
people being like i love (78:39 - 78:42)
this game because it reminds it's it's (78:40 - 78:44)
the game that i wanted back then because (78:42 - 78:46)
it looks so much prettier (78:44 - 78:50)
it's coming at a time quite frankly when (78:46 - 78:54)
a nice relaxing game sounds really good (78:50 - 78:57)
like i think it's it's approaching that (78:54 - 78:57)
sort of (78:57 - 79:00)
animal crossing just a day-to-day thing (78:57 - 79:01)
the thing is (79:00 - 79:03)
the initial buy-in is there because (79:01 - 79:04)
people are looking (79:03 - 79:08)
at it without thinking am i going to get (79:04 - 79:10)
a lot out of this game like you could (79:08 - 79:11)
play animal cross people are still (79:10 - 79:13)
playing animal crossing (79:11 - 79:16)
which also cost sixty dollars which also (79:13 - 79:18)
got six dollars i think i think animal (79:16 - 79:19)
crossing is worth the 60 (79:18 - 79:22)
oh it definitely is i think compared if (79:19 - 79:22)
you do (79:22 - 79:26)
a comparison and say like baseline (79:22 - 79:29)
pokemon's new pokemon snap is a 60 (79:26 - 79:30)
game that would mean that animal (79:29 - 79:33)
crossing is actually a 240 (79:30 - 79:36)
game because it gives you a reason to (79:33 - 79:37)
return (79:36 - 79:40)
every day every month it is constantly (79:37 - 79:40)
evolving (79:40 - 79:44)
it's engaging it's changing it's (79:40 - 79:46)
like like look at the huge difference (79:44 - 79:48)
like you can change your world in (79:46 - 79:51)
animal crossing in pokemon snap you (79:48 - 79:52)
can't change anything you just walk (79:51 - 79:54)
through and take photos (79:52 - 79:56)
i hate taking photos it doesn't it does (79:54 - 79:57)
look like they're (79:56 - 79:58)
there there's a couple things that it (79:57 - 79:59)
does look like there's a day and night (79:58 - 80:00)
cycle (79:59 - 80:03)
yeah we don't know if that's a real time (80:00 - 80:04)
but i didn't even do that in the regular (80:03 - 80:06)
pokemon game so i'm (80:04 - 80:08)
now i'm impressed okay sorry chill has a (80:06 - 80:10)
day a night cycle so i get carried away (80:08 - 80:11)
here when you're when you're done with (80:10 - 80:12)
the game when you're done with the game (80:11 - 80:14)
it doesn't lock (80:12 - 80:16)
it does look like the poke the photo (80:14 - 80:17)
decks (80:16 - 80:19)
sorry i almost said pokedex the photo (80:17 - 80:21)
decks can tell the difference between (80:19 - 80:22)
genders (80:21 - 80:25)
so you might we don't know yet but (80:22 - 80:28)
you might be able to take a picture of a (80:25 - 80:29)
male apom (80:28 - 80:32)
and be like i haven't found the female (80:29 - 80:33)
apom yet (80:32 - 80:35)
so wait so is that what they mean by (80:33 - 80:37)
more than 200 pokemon is it's actually (80:35 - 80:41)
200 pokemon and then variant gender (80:37 - 80:44)
i mean they did show him maybe (80:41 - 80:46)
the second time you go through the (80:44 - 80:48)
desert area you see a male one instead (80:46 - 80:50)
of a female one (80:48 - 80:52)
the thing is is like here's our met if (80:50 - 80:53)
it was a 30 game (80:52 - 80:56)
it would be an absolute home run at like (80:53 - 80:57)
no (80:56 - 81:00)
questions buying it (80:57 - 81:04)
playing the heck out of it as we get (81:00 - 81:07)
further away from that point i feel (81:04 - 81:11)
less i feel less likely that i'm going (81:07 - 81:12)
to actually buy this game (81:11 - 81:16)
like almost every pokemon game for me (81:12 - 81:19)
is i pretty much just buy it period and (81:16 - 81:20)
i'm getting to the point where i have a (81:19 - 81:23)
lot of things competing for my time (81:20 - 81:27)
correct and something that (81:23 - 81:29)
promises the same (81:27 - 81:32)
level and potentially the same shortness (81:29 - 81:33)
of (81:32 - 81:36)
gameplay that the first one did (81:33 - 81:39)
is not my go-to like i will (81:36 - 81:42)
most likely watch people play it and say (81:39 - 81:43)
think (81:42 - 81:46)
do am i getting like if you're streaming (81:43 - 81:49)
it will i get as much enjoyment out of (81:46 - 81:50)
watching you stream it (81:49 - 81:54)
as me playing it i need somebody to (81:50 - 81:58)
travel back in time 25 years (81:54 - 82:01)
and ask them to just like shift it one (81:58 - 82:03)
year forward or one year back and let's (82:01 - 82:04)
not have this (82:03 - 82:05)
in the same year that a new monster (82:04 - 82:07)
hunter game is coming out on switch (82:05 - 82:09)
please i think this is going to be a (82:07 - 82:10)
game where people (82:09 - 82:13)
love it for a week maybe a month and (82:10 - 82:14)
then they're (82:13 - 82:16)
done with it yeah exactly and i think (82:14 - 82:18)
that's fine (82:16 - 82:21)
my worry is just that there is not (82:18 - 82:22)
enough (82:21 - 82:25)
there and maybe if they have uh like (82:22 - 82:29)
online leaderboards where you can see (82:25 - 82:31)
no there will be no online i know there (82:29 - 82:32)
won't i know there won't there won't be (82:31 - 82:34)
any online leaderboards but it would (82:32 - 82:36)
like they did say here on the website (82:34 - 82:38)
there will be a way to share your photos (82:36 - 82:41)
yeah you upload it to twitter you like (82:38 - 82:42)
everything (82:41 - 82:43)
you hit the little photo button on your (82:42 - 82:47)
switch controller exactly yes (82:43 - 82:49)
look this game will be worth 60 dollars (82:47 - 82:50)
to me if there's a level where there's a (82:49 - 82:51)
pyramid (82:50 - 82:54)
with a glowing eye at the top of it and (82:51 - 82:55)
if you can whisper george washington was (82:54 - 82:57)
replaced by a doppelganger and it opens (82:55 - 82:58)
up like a whole new reality (82:57 - 83:01)
then yes the illuminati have won and i'm (82:58 - 83:02)
in (83:01 - 83:06)
i just hope that there's (83:02 - 83:08)
something a little bit more and i think (83:06 - 83:10)
there will be there's usually in pokemon (83:08 - 83:11)
games there's always one or two things (83:10 - 83:13)
they they like hold back (83:11 - 83:17)
it looks great i think it will be fun (83:13 - 83:21)
but 60 bucks 200 pokemon and (83:17 - 83:24)
really really banking on nostalgia is (83:21 - 83:27)
is worrisome not a deal-breaker just (83:24 - 83:28)
worrisome (83:27 - 83:31)
and and i saw a couple people being like (83:28 - 83:33)
again this is just an expectation thing (83:31 - 83:34)
we've had this with sword and shield (83:33 - 83:36)
we have this with other pokemon games (83:34 - 83:38)
but people like well they could just do (83:36 - 83:39)
dlc (83:38 - 83:42)
they could they they could what if they (83:39 - 83:45)
just made a good game to begin with (83:42 - 83:45)
like like yeah they could do dlc but (83:45 - 83:48)
who's to say you're even gonna enjoy (83:47 - 83:51)
what they put out initially (83:48 - 83:54)
uh i just i i can't even think about dlc (83:51 - 83:56)
for a game that isn't even out that i (83:54 - 83:57)
haven't even played (83:56 - 83:58)
it's just why are we thinking so far (83:57 - 84:01)
ahead it's just the same frustration i (83:58 - 84:02)
get when (84:01 - 84:04)
and i've told this story before but the (84:02 - 84:07)
day let's go pikachu let's go eevee came (84:04 - 84:08)
out (84:07 - 84:11)
we're playing it on twitch twitch.tv (84:08 - 84:12)
slash pkm and (84:11 - 84:14)
cast we're having a good time we're (84:12 - 84:16)
catching the weedles we're battling the (84:14 - 84:18)
brocks we're going through mount moon (84:16 - 84:22)
and the not even exaggerating the day (84:18 - 84:24)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee came out (84:22 - 84:27)
over a dozen people came into my twitch (84:24 - 84:28)
chat (84:27 - 84:30)
and said when do you think the next (84:28 - 84:33)
pokemon game is coming out (84:30 - 84:33)
buddy i'm playing it right now it came (84:34 - 84:38)
out six hours ago (84:37 - 84:41)
it wasn't it wasn't enough it wasn't it (84:38 - 84:43)
was diet coke it wasn't (84:41 - 84:46)
it wasn't as (84:43 - 84:48)
people just get so ahead of themselves (84:46 - 84:49)
with with (84:48 - 84:51)
everything in life but specifically with (84:49 - 84:53)
like pokemon and video games it's like (84:51 - 84:55)
what if there's dlc for pokemon snap (84:53 - 84:57)
yeah maybe what if pokemon snap (84:55 - 84:58)
what if we just waiting to see if (84:57 - 85:02)
pokemon snap's a good game first (84:58 - 85:04)
because if you don't like it your dlc (85:02 - 85:06)
argument's going out the window (85:04 - 85:08)
what if there's dlc for mario kart and (85:06 - 85:10)
all my friends have already stopped (85:08 - 85:11)
playing (85:10 - 85:13)
hmm it looks really good i believe the (85:11 - 85:15)
people making pokemon snap were the same (85:13 - 85:18)
people who made pokken tournament right (85:15 - 85:19)
i believe that is the case and the art (85:18 - 85:21)
will be good (85:19 - 85:24)
there you go uh developed by bandai (85:21 - 85:26)
namco yeah which is the same (85:24 - 85:30)
as pokemon they make (85:26 - 85:33)
katamari damasi um maybe you can there's (85:30 - 85:33)
a (85:33 - 85:36)
unlock version where you mess it over (85:33 - 85:39)
roll up all the pokemon this will be (85:36 - 85:41)
featured on uh my podcast (85:39 - 85:44)
sweet they did say over 200 pokemon and (85:41 - 85:46)
in the uh on the website they show three (85:44 - 85:48)
different vivian forms will (85:46 - 85:51)
yeah all the people who have and have (85:48 - 85:53)
not collected multiple video vivion (85:51 - 85:55)
forms i am on the i have not collected (85:53 - 85:58)
anything more than what was handed to me (85:55 - 85:59)
so (85:58 - 86:02)
are they counting like the 18 forms of (85:59 - 86:02)
vivian (86:02 - 86:07)
part of the 200 oh yeah (86:02 - 86:10)
probably worried (86:07 - 86:10)
yeah i i mean i am (86:10 - 86:15)
50 50 on the fence whether i'm buying (86:13 - 86:18)
the game i'm excited for it in (86:15 - 86:21)
in that i really want to watch people (86:18 - 86:22)
play it (86:21 - 86:24)
and if it looks really good then i might (86:22 - 86:27)
want to play it myself (86:24 - 86:30)
um because i actually think this is good (86:27 - 86:33)
content to watch and not what was it it (86:30 - 86:33)
was (86:33 - 86:36)
good content on the nintendo 64 to watch (86:33 - 86:37)
but that was before twitch (86:36 - 86:40)
that was when you go to blockbuster you (86:37 - 86:41)
rent the game for (86:40 - 86:44)
five dollars you go through the beach (86:41 - 86:45)
level (86:44 - 86:46)
it takes you what like five minutes to (86:45 - 86:49)
go through it maybe four minutes (86:46 - 86:51)
and then you get your pictures and then (86:49 - 86:53)
you hand the controller to your (86:51 - 86:56)
your somebody else in the house they do (86:53 - 86:57)
the same level (86:56 - 87:00)
they get two pictures better than you (86:57 - 87:02)
and you now have the option of like do i (87:00 - 87:04)
want to go back through beach because i (87:02 - 87:04)
want my (87:04 - 87:07)
photos to win or do i want to go to cave (87:04 - 87:10)
like that's how you play pokemon snap (87:07 - 87:10)
yeah (87:10 - 87:12)
and that's how you got the longevity out (87:10 - 87:13)
of it (87:12 - 87:15)
for the 48 hours you rented it before (87:13 - 87:17)
you sent it back to blockbuster (87:15 - 87:18)
and then when you rent it from (87:17 - 87:21)
blockbuster two weeks later (87:18 - 87:22)
you're like well it's been two weeks i (87:21 - 87:25)
guess i start off with beach (87:22 - 87:28)
uh and then i go to cave and then i go (87:25 - 87:29)
to river (87:28 - 87:32)
and then i go to uh what was the valley (87:29 - 87:34)
i think was the valley (87:32 - 87:36)
valley i think at the end of the day i (87:34 - 87:37)
will get (87:36 - 87:39)
my 60 out of it i'll play it for a week (87:37 - 87:41)
it'll be good and then i (87:39 - 87:43)
will probably end up with pokemon quest (87:41 - 87:44)
which was (87:43 - 87:47)
i played it for a week i absolutely (87:44 - 87:49)
adored it for the week but (87:47 - 87:52)
i haven't played quest since man i could (87:49 - 87:55)
never defeat the final boss in that game (87:52 - 87:58)
i didn't get very far in quest (87:55 - 88:01)
but also quest was a much cheaper game (87:58 - 88:03)
yeah it was free and if you really liked (88:01 - 88:05)
it you give it 20 bucks (88:03 - 88:08)
yeah i sort of feel like maybe that's (88:05 - 88:09)
the route they should have taken with (88:08 - 88:10)
this (88:09 - 88:11)
i mean maybe they'll put on a demo and (88:10 - 88:13)
i'll play the demo and see if i like it (88:11 - 88:15)
yeah we i mean we can't tell until we (88:13 - 88:16)
touch it yeah i don't know (88:15 - 88:20)
it's very i i it (88:16 - 88:22)
it looks pretty i disagree with a bunch (88:20 - 88:25)
of people who are saying that it doesn't (88:22 - 88:27)
i just don't having played the other (88:25 - 88:28)
game i don't know that there's the same (88:27 - 88:30)
people complaining about the graphics (88:28 - 88:31)
are probably the same people playing (88:30 - 88:32)
minecraft (88:31 - 88:34)
what do they care about graphics they're (88:32 - 88:35)
building (88:34 - 88:38)
eight bit blocks with look nobody's (88:35 - 88:41)
mine minecraft anymore we play roblox (88:38 - 88:42)

really like that i like the fact that (88:52 - 88:55)
they pulled the like the one thing that (88:53 - 88:58)
was introduced whether you liked it or (88:55 - 88:59)
not and each (88:58 - 89:01)
poor unova is there in their musical (88:59 - 89:03)

week's pokemon (89:36 - 89:40)
number one people complain about my (89:38 - 89:42)
accent which i really have little (89:40 - 89:43)
control over (89:42 - 89:46)
people don't complain about it just no i (89:43 - 89:49)
literally got a complaint from someone (89:46 - 89:52)
um related to (89:49 - 89:55)
the what one reference was the pokemon (89:52 - 89:58)
that's related to unova's throw (89:55 - 90:01)
who would that be greg salk soak (89:58 - 90:04)
that's right and then i made a reference (90:01 - 90:05)
to (90:04 - 90:08)
when i uh did the whole thing about (90:05 - 90:11)
um dagnabbit lullaby evolves into where (90:08 - 90:14)
my brain is lost (90:11 - 90:18)
lullaby in into (90:14 - 90:18)
mandibuzz and i had the whole reference (90:19 - 90:23)
to the (90:22 - 90:27)
to the word what is the word mandible (90:23 - 90:30)
buzzer buzzard is buzzard is used to (90:27 - 90:32)
refer to vultures in this country and (90:30 - 90:35)
walks (90:32 - 90:35)
sock is a fighting type hawk is a type (90:37 - 90:40)
of bird (90:39 - 90:43)
and then i also brought up the wrestling (90:40 - 90:46)
team enzo amore and big cass (90:43 - 90:49)
because they're known for saying soft (90:46 - 90:51)
s-a-w-f-t (90:49 - 90:55)
now here we go fighting type a hawk (90:51 - 90:58)
and wrestling what (90:55 - 91:01)
what pokemon does that make you think of (90:58 - 91:03)
it (91:01 - 91:05)
[Music] (91:03 - 91:08)
knocked owl oh what a clever little (91:05 - 91:10)
knock show (91:08 - 91:14)
it's halucha for lucha that's right (91:10 - 91:17)
and i don't want to name names but (91:14 - 91:18)
somebody in my twitter dm (91:17 - 91:21)
said i can't think of a hawk pokemon and (91:18 - 91:22)
i'm like are you (91:21 - 91:24)
serious (91:22 - 91:24)
i hope it's not the person whose (91:25 - 91:29)
favorite pokemon is halucha (91:27 - 91:31)
when i was no no but it's somebody who's (91:29 - 91:33)
a big fan of wrestling (91:31 - 91:37)
when i was doing uh players cup three (91:33 - 91:39)
there was a team i fought that had a (91:37 - 91:41)
zatu (91:39 - 91:44)
oh right i saw that one and i was (91:41 - 91:46)
so worried because i didn't know what (91:44 - 91:47)
zatu did (91:46 - 91:49)
i mean they had a pretty standard team (91:47 - 91:51)
like they had like pokemon i recognized (91:49 - 91:52)
and i was like okay this pokemon does (91:51 - 91:54)
this this pokemon does this this pokemon (91:52 - 91:55)
does this (91:54 - 91:57)
and then they just had a zatu and i was (91:55 - 91:58)
like dude it really wrecks fl (91:57 - 92:01)
fighting types i was like do i do i (91:58 - 92:03)
attack the zatu first do i leave (92:01 - 92:06)
i don't know what the zatu does (92:03 - 92:08)
uh but uh the zatu didn't get to do (92:06 - 92:10)
anything unfortunately i (92:08 - 92:12)
i think i i faked out the zatu and then (92:10 - 92:14)
i attacked its partner and then i (92:12 - 92:16)
attacked the zatu next but (92:14 - 92:18)
the that's the that's the thing with (92:16 - 92:20)
competitive sometimes you're just like (92:18 - 92:23)
oh i've never fought a zod too i don't (92:20 - 92:23)
know (92:23 - 92:26)
i don't even know it's moveset i mean (92:23 - 92:28)
i'm sure it sets up tailwind if (92:26 - 92:30)
zatu has tailwind yeah i don't know (92:28 - 92:32)
[Music] (92:30 - 92:34)
you mean you never did find out what it (92:32 - 92:35)
was supposed to yeah i never i never (92:34 - 92:37)
found out what it's supposed to do (92:35 - 92:40)
uh it's like it's like those uh rogue (92:37 - 92:41)
decks and tcg will where (92:40 - 92:43)
they they pull out a card and you're (92:41 - 92:46)
like can i read that because uh (92:43 - 92:48)
yeah no one's ever actually played that (92:46 - 92:50)
card against me (92:48 - 92:52)
so can i uh can i please read what that (92:50 - 92:53)
card does (92:52 - 92:56)
uh zatu does learn tailwind (92:53 - 92:59)
i feel like we've had halucha be pokemon (92:56 - 93:00)
of the week (92:59 - 93:03)
yes i'm running out of ideas folks (93:00 - 93:07)
maybe next week can be zatu (93:03 - 93:09)
no i've already written next week's and (93:07 - 93:11)
it is definitely not (93:09 - 93:14)
zatu unfortunately it's knocked out (93:11 - 93:16)
what a clever little knock towel all (93:14 - 93:18)
right shuffle icon greg and then let's (93:16 - 93:19)
move forward (93:18 - 93:23)
uh shovel icon for hallucia (93:19 - 93:25)
if i remember correct me back to the (93:23 - 93:27)
page it's good (93:25 - 93:28)
i mean i think it's i think it's one of (93:27 - 93:30)
those it's really good it even had a (93:28 - 93:32)
shiny shuffle icon (93:30 - 93:35)
it's hard it's hard to do a bad hoalucha (93:32 - 93:37)
that is like a general (93:35 - 93:39)
it's missing one thing but generally (93:37 - 93:41)
otherwise it's a pretty good pokemon all (93:39 - 93:42)
around (93:41 - 93:44)
yeah i mean apart from the fact that it (93:42 - 93:45)
always looks mad (93:44 - 93:49)
i like both i like i like (93:45 - 93:51)
the lighter color of the shuffle over (93:49 - 93:52)
the trosie (93:51 - 93:55)
the trojan one's sort of more flat so i (93:52 - 93:56)
like the fact that the shuffle (93:55 - 93:58)
also has a shiny like it's a good (93:56 - 94:00)
shuffle icon it's also a good (93:58 - 94:02)
shiny it is a good shiny it's it's a (94:00 - 94:03)
vibrant (94:02 - 94:06)
change and i'm into that all right this (94:03 - 94:09)
week's pokemon of the week (94:06 - 94:12)
i i thought i was going easy on folks i (94:09 - 94:13)
don't know (94:12 - 94:17)
maybe i have gone easy maybe this is (94:13 - 94:18)
going to be a tough one (94:17 - 94:20)
i i don't live in your head i can't tell (94:18 - 94:22)
you that you're going to respond to this (94:20 - 94:26)
here we go think back to kanto (94:22 - 94:28)
