[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 250 seventh episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i am your host SBJ and with me today i have will and i have rediscovered how comfortable yoga pants can be i put on my yoga pants that i've had for years so they haven't worn in a long time and boy oh boy what have I been missing out on these things are great no one knows it knows disagreeing with you there how many pairs of yoga pants do you have I know I wouldn't say I have yoga pants but I have I don't know what they're called sweat pants jogging islands nah not even sir different yeah i don't know like special are is there a difference between sweat pants and jogging pants or they're the same and no idea that jogging pant is well joggers is a style of pant but um that it's more like a cut vs a material but yoga pants are like very stretchy like tights except that down towards the bottom they're a little more open and not tight but they're just super comfy for lounging around the house speaking of comfy we have Travis here yeah I also made a discovery this last week which is that I don't like packs yeah you said that we we just got back from pax well we could go now but find out kind of joking but I I guess I guess what I realized was was that big conventions aren't really my thing I had a whole bunch of fun doing our panel and talking with everybody involved with the show and meeting up with everybody we met up with but I that the convention itself is is not really my cup of tea my I'm so particular with the video games I even play anymore that it's all a bunch of games that I haven't heard of most of which have already come out and then I wait in line for a very very long time to play these games I hadn't heard of before hand and so I end up skipping them so yeah it was weird to go to the the thing that some people would say is like the coolest part of the year and for me to realize oh this this isn't for me yeah i think steve and i actually ended up playing more tabletop games than video games hex is uh a weird packs because most of the things being shown were things that were already out yeah which is not normally the case I mean like though is that is that not normally because at that that surprised me but I thought oh maybe this is just how it is no no like at PAX west by the way this is a Pokemon podcast and I'll give you a quick rundown for the show we're going to talk about packs for a little bit because we all three of us got back and then we're going to poke my knees we're gonna we're going to answer some emails and then travis has our poke amount of the week and that's going to be our show it might be a little bit of a shorter shorter side of things but going back to pax at PAX West pretty much everything on the show floor was with stuff that was not out yet like you could play Final Fantasy 15 early which which that was obviously before final fantasy 15 came out they had a huge arc booth which is that dinosaur game and I know they were showing their new expansion early and I could be wrong i don't i don't know that i don't know that game that well but from what app from what I understood that was like the first time you could play that I played the the new destiny expansion there before the destiny stuff came out there was more square enix tough and and just like a bunch of stuff that okay this is definitely the first time I'm playing it and and there wasn't really any of that at East like will and i played toejam and earl yeah even you know that giant triple a title the remake of toejam and earl wish I don't even know what that is was it as 0 0 sega genesis game or something yeah yeah like that so like we played that early I guess that was cool that's the heck of a game will tell you that but yeah it was it was like two days in Travis and will and I are walking and Travis just like leans over and goes I don't think I like packs very much well what were your thoughts I was your first packs right yeah I mean I just had fun because I got to hang out with you guys that was also incredibly fun I should I should make sure I mentioned that I had a blast of a time hanging out with you all and at what was a little different too was I feel like like when we go to gencon we actually have a pretty large group and even like when we did our secret winter retreat we had a pretty large group but for this one it was mostly just like the four of us and that was a lot the fourth one being Irene who I mean obviously not here but I think the best part was when Irene and I had had enough of crowds and we kind of just went back and then watched episodes of hey arnold with the slack community need coloring books and did colouring books yeah big shout out to Nick I'm most of our listeners and slack know Nick as as one of the most active people in her slack community but he's from Boston and home and his wife helped us get around the town a lot easier especially with the the subway system and the buses and stuff and so she's a shout out to to those too but sounds like sounds like Travis you're not going to go back to a pax I mean I mean I i will go back to pax if we have another panel there and it's at a time in the year where I can make it but I mean I want to be able to be there when we have panel shows at conventions because that's really cool and a way we can interact face-to-face with our fans that we really can't otherwise because the show's over the Internet it's I guess it's just a shame that that has to come at activity that i don't really like but i'll take the you know i'll take the bitter pill for the really really cool opportunity to be able to tell bad jokes in front of a room of 400 people d definitely I think it's perfectly okay also to like just focus on going to panels and the smaller types of things like the diversity lounge that we went to yeah going into those kinds of things which aren't the huge crowds the huge lines and everything because that's that's where I had the most fun too oh I and of course also meeting up with our listeners that we did see you know who came up and you know some folks drove up from New York like Kelly just to have lunch so that was really cool yeah yeah i think the the panel went went well for what it was if you guys didn't listen to it yet or or if you weren't a pact that is that is up on our podcast feed 250 listen closely you can hear the sweat drops just rolling face was was that the first time you spoke live Travis that in in a pommy a setting I'm sure you've done a excellent stuff for the podcast yeah I mean it wasn't the it wasn't public speaking that made me nervous so much I've done that a lot i coached I assistant coached a debate team for two years and did high school debate for four years before that so public speaking is not new to me at all but trying to tell jokes and trying to make people laugh in a group like that that is pretty new to me because typically it's in at just a more like persuasive setting than a supposed comedy or entertainment setting it was just a different tinge on something that I did have experience with yeah I just wanted to give a shout out to everyone who did come out we we had a room of 400 people we were in the Bobcat theater and we we filled that room and according to the packs enforcers who talked to me after the show they said they had to turn away about 50 or so people just because we were we were full up and I guess those numbers get reported to somebody at pax and thence that goes on a consideration for future rooms and future ex post and stuff like that so yeah I think the next packs coming up is pax Australia which is probably something not doable not only is it like a 26-hour flight but plane ticket style tralee aren't necessarily the cheapest so we might skip on that but i believe packs wes is coming up after that which is usually the first week or so of sep tember and so i'll apply for a panel there i don't i don't know if we'll get it I don't think anything's guaranteed when it comes to pax but I don't see any shaymin in applying especially because according to the packs enforcers at PAX West that even though we didn't fill the room that time we had an extremely great turnout for a Sunday morning which i think is one of the the worst times to be booked for a panel I don't think anyone wants to wake up first thing on a Sunday and go to a Pokemon gotta get your poke a church-going right yeah especially I would assume that saturday is the big the big stay up late night and what not yet did you know that there's like actually like a lot of parties and stuff yeah we completely didn't do why would like I mean I was aware of my watch ideally have gone yeah I told you to follow pack slimes packs official impacts parties and I thought I did but none of them showed up on my Twitter feed so I they were tweeting all week oops yes if there was like a big gay party that you were like oh you could have gone to this and it ended an hour ago and I was like oh great well let me my tasty burger a good night yeah well if it was the tasty burger night that was our I had to nice team at other nights yeah there's a there's an ihub went up that it was the night we saw giant bomb and we got back Travis and you were already sleeping and yeah that was when the the wind became like a giant blade of pain and it has bit of a tornado situation it was like negative 3 Aryan tornadus situation is somebody coming from Wisconsin I'm very used to the cold but there's just something about that Boston win that was just brutal so while will and I were uber in back to the hotel we had I really uper of jazz yeah that guy who that guy was not not a good driver uh we had Irene order us tasty burger I think we ended up having tasty burger like three or three times in that trip I'll my son tasty burger type person I think I had it one more time maybe it was at the airport but again thank you to everyone who came out to pax and saw since that high and had dinner with us or had lunch with us the next day like it was all fantastic and that's that's why we go to those conventions to like see you guys and to like talk to you and to hang out and I know there was like four or five dudes that came up and they were like hey really liked your show listen every week thank you I'm like they kind of walked off after that and was like I almost wanted to like stop them be like but I'm here now talk to me like I'm here for you guys but I get like people are busy and they're trying to see a hundred things like for being there for three days I think I was only on the show floor for like maybe two hours at most and I barely we complained earlier about not I'm not a lot of new things being on the show floor but I'd even have the time to see everything on the show floor just because of how busy we were but yeah pax was a great experience hopefully will do will do a future packs or pax's but yeah I guess with that being said let's jump into some Pokemon news not a not very heavy news week unless I'm just missing some stuff but first bit of news here is legendary Pokemon head to Pokemon go by the end of the year knee antic CEO promises that we'll be able to really catch them all rare pokemon like mew and mewtwo are set to appear in Pokemon go by the end of 2017 according to John Hanke CEO and developer of knee antic in the interview in an interview with the German edition of Wired hankie explains that making legendary Pokemon available to catch in the mobile take of the franchise is a priority for the team this year quote i can say with certainty certainty that we will see them before the end of this year Hankey said when asked about legendary Pokemon player should not expect every rare Pokemon from first and generation to appear though wired specifically just called out five of them mew mew 2 and the 3 legendary birds Articuno Zapdos and Moltres are already included in Pokemon go in an indirect fashion their mascots games three teams the quote the value of Pokemon is that each one is very unique and they have their own stories and characteristics he explained I do want to preserve and if possible enhance the aspect as they are all not the same although he was talking about ditto an uncommon Pokemon who's late introduction to Pokemon go caused a stir late last fall the same philosophy likely applies the legendary Pokemon these one-of-a-kind monsters are hard to find in the main line pokemon games that's not true so it's about no surprise that in the antic intends to make their take view appearances special for the mobile take so basically what they're saying is no Articuno no Moltres know as aptos period at least not for 2017 no they said those three plus mu 2 mu will be available in 2017 oh oh I took that as that they said that because those are the mascots of the three teams that those three wouldn't be in oh they're already included because they're the mascots yeah teams that's what it meant it sounded like but this also means that Mew and Mewtwo are not showing up until December 25th 2017 so don't hold your breath I wonder if its act III doubt it's ever going to be what they originally pitched us which was like 302 flying around Times Square yeah and 300 people all catching it together like I can't imagine that that's that's going to happen we've seen nothing similar to that or even would have to be a completely new mechanic like some sort of maybe like an alert goes out on your phone like miu chi-wah thin one mile and then I'm but it would probably something new like that my guess for the birds is maybe they would introduce something where you know I don't know enough about the back end of that game there are people who know so much more about Pokemon go than I do but my so maybe this isn't possible without major changes but my possible guess is that they might make it so that zapdos Articuno and Moltres are extremely rare spawns near gems that are controlled by that team so an extremely rare this spawn near Mystic Jim might be an Articuno for example or or maybe it's just like it's extremely rare to get a one of the three birds and then whatever the closest gym is it converts it turns into that does that make sense that would be my guess yeah that does make sense I mean what you're trying to say is logically coherent dead don't think it makes sense as an actual tactic to be used in the game but sure I I always assumed going in that we would we would have more promotions or more like sponsorships of like hey there's farfetch at this target on every Sunday and this is the only place to get it and we haven't gotten any of that like the closest thing we got was the starbucks stuff and that was just hey if you go into Starbucks you can order a Pokemon go Frappuccino it has nothing to really do with the game except when you spin the starbucks it's there it reminds you that you could buy this drink can I make a confession goodbye starbucks now when i went to starbucks and i read asked me to get her the pokemon go Frappuccino I didn't even ask them for it yeah I mean it's pretty simple for them to make click two ingredients that was a real busy starbucks I didn't want to deal with that I was of other starbucks that was just like that had turned up the base for some reason when we were in there and it was just a terrible sound system where the base was turned up very nice this was actually a different one because I didn't realize there was a Starbucks around the corner from the hotel so I actually walked a mile to go to a Starbucks good one yup next bit of news here is cap Pikachu pika pika selenium Z to be available in Japan however you say that this month's corocoro comic revealed that Ash's Pikachu will be available via serial code that will be available to customers who pre-order tickets to the 20th Pokemon movie this pikachu will be wearing ashes hat with a special iteration of the hat varying when the code is redeemed the pika she miam z will also be available but with the Pikachu only one code per each ticket each code can only be redeemed once players even if a player redeems multiple codes in the same go it can only obtain one Pikachu Z I gave up on saying that note that other note that the codes may only work in Japanese region games the Hat the Pikachu where's will be determined by the following so it looks like the Hat is determined by dates so like April fifteenth may first will be the original hat may third to May 15th will be the Hoenn hat so depending on on tickets and when you buy them that's what hat you're getting so there are six hats total is it Pikachu neum Z yeah that's probably right I mean I can't see the word so I'm just guessing why whatever episodes me spelling something Pik a sh un I um that sounds like Pikachu neum but also I can I do a public service announcement I have heard people are I've seen people in writing refer to this particular pokemon as the hash hat Pikachu um please come up with that's just far too dangerous on the tongue come up with a different name before that particular just call it the Hat Pikachu the the anniversary that's my anniversary Pikachu the movie Pikachu anything but just avoid calling it the ash hat Pikachu because you may end up saying something that you regret ashes baseball cap pika true there you go that's perfectly fine more Pikachu news here is bestow Pikachu available again as part of a Pokemon with you campaign and River in remembrance of the 2011 Toa Hoku earthquake and tsunami players who donate to be Pokemon with you campaign from March 11th through March 31st will receive a serial code the for a Pikachu that knows bestow the following will the file this follows the distribution of a similar Pikachu last year it looks like this is only for Japanese region games but the Pikachu is level 10 holding a sweetheart has a classic ribbon knows the ability static knows the moves stowe hold hands return and play nice the original trainer is uh something in Japanese but there you go and what is bestow do it gives the item that your Pokemon is holding to the target so it's thematically rather than hmm so if you had like a poison orb you hand that over I mean if you want to be a jerk yikes that's real mean or a flame orb how rude hmm I would just give like my leftover food give my leftovers because yet here I give give like a lucky coin or or you could give a berry to your partner in doubles amulet amulet coin I'm sorry I'm sorry everyone a final bad news is Charizard code available in this month's Cora Cora due to winning the cork or a popularity contest serial number serial codes to obtain Charizard in Pokemon Sun and Moon are available in this month's cork or comic this Charizard will know the moves Dragon Claw dragon rage fly and flare blitz the code can be redeemed March fifteenth through May fourteenth and this will only work with Japanese region games sorry someone Japanese only stuff but hey charizard won a popularity contest who would have guessed yeah and people can still trade you those charred charizard's over the Internet yeah you could read a an bestowed Pikachu no not as exciting as a Charizard yeah but that Charizard doesn't know anything that great hmm what if it's mega Charizard X and it becomes a dragon-type I mean you don't need a popularity contest to get a mega Charizard X you just get one else there are hiding charms our nights behind some competitive wall yeah competitive signup wall

com hit that contact button that'll get you right that'll that'll eat those emails will come into the same place sentences haha first email is from Dominic says hey spj and crew I listened to the podcast at work almost as soon as you put them out thanks for doing what you do also it's hilarious when you can't pronounce things you should probably work on that anyways I was writing to respond about your claim that there is not being a snow cone Pokemon at your PAX East podcast there is a snow cone Pokemon its name is vanilluxe it's as great as you can imagine thanks for the podcast Dominic that was the yeah thanks for running the email that's the that's the joke we were trying to make there is that Steve and I both really really like vanilluxe so and will you like vanilluxe to you right I mean I tolerate it and it's a Pokemon that a lot of people hate so we always bring up that as the like the paragon of Pokemon design so when someone asks us to design a Pokemon from scratch we were like you know I think I think an ice cream cone would be the best Pokemon so we were being a little tongue-in-cheek but I could see how our nervous sarcasm wouldn't really translate very well in communication but yeah a vanilluxe is actually my second favorite Pokemon that was the joke Alex rights in from Thanks for writing in by the way Alex rights in from Salt Lake City Utah tea dear t-dog Little Willie and Stephen oh I think Travis's tdawg yeah I'd rather be tdawg so Travis your Little Willie I I mean I'm fine with being a little Willy I'm writing on up to it I'm writing because I want to know the answer the most important question ever aerial or Helvetica spj strokes me as a Helvetica kind of guy he's well put together professional and quite overall quite attractive I don't know about that but okay thanks for kind words will seems more of an aerial persona very very played back and casual doesn't care if he isn't as fancy looking but also quite attractive Travis is wing-dings cuz you know I thanks for the last Oh Alex I guess Ariel's bad right we all agree that that's a terrible font it's just trying to look like helvetica but it doesn't do it right yeah and i would like to post a correction that I'm Times New Roman oh all the way times remember the little Times New Roman is also bad well then I'm bad because I am Times New Roman so live with it deal with it uh yeah I'm a typo I like helvetica a lot what were you gonna say Travis my favorite typefaces future features okay they have like weird m's weird capital M's I like the I like the things about future that are weird so yeah I like Gotham a lot I like helvetica a lot I like her haveta canoe which is very different than Helvetica and the one that I have been using a lot especially like Pokemon podcast related as baybay I think it's babe a BB I don't know how people say it but it's BBE I like that font a ton and trying to think of anything else that sticks out in my last job I was doing a lot of graphic design style I was doing a lot of design stuff in my last job and I inherited a logo and basically an entire aesthetic that was built around trajan trajan is the definition of a time-tested font but boy is it not fun to work with it's really hard to build things around like you can't like you can rarely put it in something because it's so I don't know you would have a better time describing the phenomena trying to describe you know what I'm saying yeah it's is it yeah I will I will because you put me on the spot I will struggle them as much as you a veneer is another font that I really like oh you know what maybe I'm not Times New Roman can I be Garamond Garamond is a really good fun it's okay I mean I've got it I've got to be serif I've got to be summer not in love with that I also like Adele a lot as a pharmd not the singer the font but there you gather some font chat for you John writes in from Warwick New York I don't know whether where that is war with New York yeah well it is west of East Warwick hi there just wanted to start by saying that I listen to your show during the Sun and Moon special coverage and I really liked what I heard now I'm a subscriber and I'm slowly going for the backlog of earlier episode I recently listen to episode 2 25 anxiety meditation comfy with Dan reichert the title caught my eyes it was scrolling through as I suffer from anxiety the episode was very helpful to me and i bought Dan's book that night I liked that the change of pace a little bit of a serious topic introduced with regular pokemon stuff I'm hoping for more I'm hoping for more of that sprinkled into the norm if topic fits I think anxiety is a topic that a lot of gamers can relate to so thank you for having that special episode I have a question for all of you which combination that has not been used a Pokemon game would you eventually like to see I'd like to see an ice / poison Pokemon thanks again for doing what you do and helping John from Warwick New York so can you read a list of Pokemon combinations that have not been used there's a bubble PD article I'm calling the read that list before yeah as you guys are pulling that up I'll comment on the the Dan article so for maybe newer listeners or those who haven't been listening as long to 25 or is it to 26 to 26 sorry that episode with dan dan reichert is one of the editors over at Giant Bomb and I was able to get him on the show he has written a couple books at to one of them being one of them being on his anxiety and how he deals with that and that was book I picked up in I read and I'm a big fan of giant bomb huh so having him on the show and talking to him about that book was was something that was really important to me and I think that's kind of how I want most of the interviews to be on the show we've had people like Griffin macro Xavier woods Dan Reicher gaijin hunter a whole bunch of other people on the show and they all like this is a Pokemon show right so we always start off asking them a couple Pokemon questions and we end the show asking them with a couple Pokemon questions but really the the middle part of those interviews aren't supposed to be Pokemon focused like it's nice that they like Pokemon there oh that Pokemon has influenced them in some way and that has brought them to our show to talk about that but really it's more to get to know them and to kind of take the step outside of pokemon and and have those kind of conversations and so that's something that's important to me and something that I think that works well with the podcast that we would that we do every now and then I think the to just extend on that I think that the writer of the email was also suggesting that maybe we include more serious content in the non interview portions of the show too just because they didn't mention any specifics of where they would like to see that and I think what's where it gets interesting there is because the rest of the show has fallen into such a I don't want to say routine because now i guess the it's I mean you're getting different you know different takes every week different takes on things but it's you know it's we go through what we've been doing this week then we go through the news than we do and lately we've been doing a lot of emails and then we always do pokemon of the week and I think it's difficult to find serious subject matter every week with those things but I think we have even more recently done a little bit more of that starting I think with the Sun and Moon series but then just going on in like a few episodes that followed it where where this this group as opposed to the sun and moon series group sort of responded to the to the email response to the Sun and Moon series so I think it comes in waves like that right like occasionally something will come up like that like the team skull topic came up in the sun and moon series and then for a couple of episodes we'll talk about that more serious subject matter and then a lot of episodes like this where we're not really talking about something too serious because there's nothing topically relevant that is topically relevant to Pokemon that we would need right now to talk about but I don't think any of us are averse to doing that more if that's what people want to see ya yeah I don't want to say well send in more serious emails and we can address them there but I do say stop asking us about what type comment not kidding I do say at the beginning of the email segment you can send in emails about pokemon or not about Pokemon and we'll we'll address them all and we'll talk about typefaces and whatever whatever floats our way we're not we're not really sure Travis what was the worst day if your see it totally uh glad that that episode though like helped in some way chose a list of type combinations that haven't been used I've figured you'd have it let's hear it well I hold it up that's a long list dude oh we're gonna go for it a normal poison normal Rock normal bug normal ghost normal steel normal ice fighting ground fighting electric fighting fairy poison steel poison electric poison psychic poison ice poison fairy ground fairy Rock ghost bug psychic it's hot are you even able to tell when I'm saying one and then a new one I was and then you like fell out of rid of them for sale oh and we feel it's kind of like you're making up a word it doesn't even sound like a real word it also they doing the thing where they went what are happening it is the list doing the thing where they're considering normal poison to not be a type and then poison normal and to not be in sight because they're they're not counting permutation okay good hominy else I'll start over and normal poison normal Rock normal bug normal ghost normal steel normal ice fighting ground fighting electric that would be mine right there fighting electric I can't believe there's not a fighting electric fighting fairy poison steel poison electric poison psychic poison ice poison fairy ground fairy Rock ghost bug psychic bug ice bug dragon bug dark fire grass fire ice fire fairy electric dark dark fairy and then yet that's the last one that wasn't that many uh well I guess cuz the list i'm looking at had the opposite directions oh yeah yeah everybody comes down to it it sounds like poison is the one that's that's not mixed with a lot of other types and normal and normal still has a lot of its combinations not added in and a lot of normal combinations are unique type combinations like normal ground is only diggersby right and normal psychic is only to rafa reg and normal dragon is only dreamt like there's yeah but my choice would be normal ghost because I just think that that would be too cool can't be hit by normal type moves can't be hit by fighting-type moves can't be hit by ghosts type moves I want to see a bug dragon that'd be cool I Joey rights in from Pennsylvania PA what's that yeah hahaha yes that's pennsylvania i did youre trying to say a town named like what is that welsh town in Pennsylvania that's bala bala cynwyd do something like that I ever heard of it yeah no clue this is for wheel wells don't don't get me wrong you are awesome but in in the packs podcast you said you hated and would not play stardew valley because you don't play farming simulators but then you said you loved farming berries and pokemon games let's dig dip let's dig deep here what's your beef with stardew valley I've never played it but I've watched people on twitch and I'm just curious love the podcast and all three of you guys and Micah and Irene as well considering the Sun and Moon week-long podcast was what introduced me to the show thanks Joey will doesn't like glorifying work under a feudal system well I don't know any I mean I honestly don't know very much about stardew valley at all because once I found out that it was a farming simulator I didn't look at it but somebody got me as a birthday present one year that like the most famous of the farming simulators what is that one harvest moon harvest moon our review d there's a lot of bad harvest moon games there are a lot of bad at harvest moon dams yes one harvest moon 3d is one of the bad ones yeah yeah that was one of the bad ones and when I found out that I couldn't marry a guy and that we could be farmers together I was like why am I wasting my time this this game is boring and awful you can marry a character of the same gender I played as a girl and I married a girl so well some I thought that was one of the ones where you couldn't either way its just oh no I'm talking about I'm talking about in and start gargle yeah that should be on yeah but unfortunately harvest moon may destroyed all future hope of farming simulators for me and honestly me a requirement that for a woman yeah Barry farming in pokemon is not a farming simulation it's a chance to get little lady buzz to show up in your bushes and then you catch them as they are pokemon it's it's it's yeah it's not cord the game like you have to make these crops in order to make money and survive now no I I have a hard enough time surviving in the real world I don't need it to be a struggle in my video games as well I but insert a valley you don't have to grow anything like you can yeah that's the interesting thing about that game is the surprising depth of the other aven't like that well certainly I guess the variety of ways in which you can run your farm right like you can just have it be the honey bee a generator or like like a honey generator or a like a brewery or um or whatever but then even the other avenues you can take like especially mining there's a lot going on there it takes a long time to mine all the way down to the bottom of the mine and even then there's more to do so yeah I guess that so it's the depth of the other activities that really surprised me hows about this other call out to the PAX East panel number one does start a valley involve or require collecting things yes there are none when rare crows you got to collect them all okay a is not you said required though like you don't have to do any like you don't have to like it doesn't stop your progress of the game there's also an achievement if you sell one of every single item in the game so you can count that as collecting to all right I'll give that to you number two does it have cute things in it yeah yeah there's a lot of like cute animals and stuff number three does it involve rolling yeah you know one you can roll with your cows all day long would you stop with your roll with your crew roll with your cows that's a bad joke I'm trying to think I there's got to be something what would try that is out of the desert there's a bunch of gambling games you can play yeah not rolling roll the slots um that's not that is rolling what else would I call it I when you tuck into a ball and roll and roll around like a ball that's the only role that I'm interested in I'm trying to think if you roll any like snowballs in any of the winter holidays Oh like an animal crossing a truly great game where you can roll a little snowman yeah I'm trying to think if there's that and started valley I can't remember ah the rolling stipulation is tough to get around with you why do you play uh why do you play monster hunter because you roll whenever you're on fire to put yourself out and you roll the dodge from the monster why do you does they're like dodge rolling in destiny or something uh there is not but I really don't play that much money mm except that you did a lot how did your patrol the grounds were playing I said again your pegs are all on the ground eggs roll away from you action i'll take a roll away but in real life i think but i think you but I think don't the pigs sometimes no they don't really roll even yeah I don't think I don't think we have roll what about the jelly things in 30 Valley they roll right you can like get a cage of jelly things I don't what they're called climb the their type of locomotion could only arguably be described as rolling I think they more they kind of slurp around what about the minecarts they roll down the mine shaft yeah yeah now sorry pass hard pass I mean at some point you can have kids in that game if you marry if you don't marry same-sex and there's some rolling that happens they don't think it's in the real world why would I want kids in the video saying that is rolling involved you you might want not one to partake but there's oh there's indeed Rome one of the at one of the animations of that of the kids does roll boom it's their got you and it's there it's in it not not for me not gonna happen you try stardew valley it's good do you like one more email here Aaron writes in hey guys hope you're doing well of the show let's get down to life's real tough questions which is better pizza or burgers also will is the best because he lifts also because he house me for a week when I was in DC all the best Aaron from Oklahoma I was only like three days it wasn't a whole week haha dad don't like you as he welcomed if you were there for all know Aaron's cool i like Aaron uh hmm well when it is sugar we thought choice workers I would probably say burgers cuz you get more protein so there you go hmm I feel like it's it's easier to mess up a burger that it is a pizza if it then you just send it back it's really hard because P Pizza usually get there you go where they make you sad burgers yeah also that no no just like okay okay so like you can go to like tasty burger right and you can get a pretty decent burger I I think we all agree those burgers were good hello my guts didn't agree late on Saturday night but sure the flavor was there right but then you can go to like Applebee's and pay double the amount for a burger and that burger is mediocre I really need to go to the tasty burger in DC don't I so you see what I'm saying where where I could get either pizza hut or papa johns or dominoes and all those pizzas are different but at the end of the day it's like ah that was pizza and pizza is good but so well no all I'm gonna say is like you usually don't get delivery burgers so if you get a bad burger it's easy to send it back and say no this burger is bad but you usually get delivery pizza where and then if it's bad you can't really send it back yeah but if you really want a burger and you're stuck at like applebees you're not there's nothing you can do that that's it in that situation to get a good burger no matter how many times you send it back yeah it's never gonna get any better I am gonna say pizza because I'm a socialist and I like the inherent sharing that's almost required by a pizza because very infrequently are you going to eat a whole one by oneself speak for yourself sir there's also a I've done it don't get me wrong but generally a pizza is a thing to be shared and I find that to be an admirable quality there's also the the multiple layers of burger and how like sometimes the meat can be too thick or the buns can be too thin there's like this balance though the meat to bun ratio has to be has to be really right for a burger to hit it spot I mean I would probably say that burgers are better than pizzas I'm just saying that burgers have more opportunity of failure then a pizza does can we talk about colonialism for why because how fascinating is it that we when you think of Italy and even if you were trying to think of like three ingredients right of Italian cuisine that are just like a central to italian cuisine you're in thing of like pasta you're gonna think of cheese maybe and then I mean maybe someone who really knows the talin cuisine would say something different but then at least a layperson would say that the third one is tomato right because like tomato sauce is in a lot of at least Americanized Italian food and I would guess a lot of Italian food generally the tomato is indigenous to North America I think it's interesting that and the pasta is indigenous to China right so so it's interesting that the the cultural identities of even the colonizers are pretty wildly changed by that activity was this have to do with a good burger not that not that Italy was in part whatever I just think it's interesting that you don't get Italian cuisine and you don't get pizza until you get the colonization I'm not saying either way what I think about colonization but i'm sure you can read between the lines I like a good burger I do like burgers but yeah i'm i'm gonna say pizza is my answer alright well i think that should wrap it up wrap it up for emails we still have a bunch in the in the in the hopper the the hopper of emails we'll get to those next week and if you have your own emails that you want to write in you can do so at SBJ at pkmn cast com or pokemon podcast com hit that contact button and that'll let you send an email to the same place otherwise we're gonna switch gears here now throw it over to Travis and they are going to do the Pokemon of the week that's right our pokemon of the week this week is porygon to which gets a lot more use than its evolution porygon z because poori onto is pretty much the best pokemon in the game to use the item evo light ed light is an item that gives a boost to the defense and special defense of a pokemon that has the capability to evolve other pokemon that pen they use at our pokemon like chancy our move set this week and so all of this as we've been doing for quite a while is going to be in VGC doubles our move set for this week i'm going to give you to our first one comes from brandon weisner and brandon is actually giving us the move set from gavin Michaels who won to regionals with this porygon too that's porygon to with EVO light the ability download the EVs are 252 and HP 252 and defense Foreign special attack with a bold nature the moves are ice beam Thunderbolt recover and trick room it also makes note to have zero IVs in attack and speed that's something you see a lot the zero IVs an attack is because you want to have the least amount of damage dealt from whoo boy what's the name of that move how am I forgetting it already the one that deals damage based on the targets attack grass a dark-type move nope that's tongue one based on weight nope it's uh ahaha pursuit no that's the one that snowman no make good guesses um give me at least the dark type moves yeah it's a grass not isn't a dark-type move well uh for ISA dark fowl play foul play that's what it is thank you will the zero attack e Ivy's rather is to prevent damage from foul play and the zero speed Ivy's are so that because Morgan to you isn't going to outspeed anything in general having the zero speed IVs and then the bold nature is going to ensure that you can act as like a counter to trick room if it does get engaged because if you think about it like you're not going to speed anything anyway so you might as well have porygon to be as slow as possible um and like I said the moves are ice beam Thunderbolt recover and trow its trick room so it's also because you're running trick room so nevermind what I just said before but zero speed IVs because you're running trick room um ice beam Thunderbolt recover and trick room he set up trick room so you're slow Pokemon can actually move first recover because this is a bulky Pokemon anyway and it's extremely hard to take out and because you don't have leftovers because you're running evo light you'll need some way to recover HP and then ice beam on Thunderbolt are just incredibly good coverage now the ability is the main point of contention in our slack channel which is which is interesting because pretty much everyone does run download although I I do by the arguments of slack user Elma LH Almeida uh who argues that that trace might be a little bit undervalued um I I would probably say that the common consensus that download is better is correct but I also can buy that trace might have some niche use as well so go into what those two abilities do and why download is probably a little bit better but not but why you might run trace conceivably download is an ability where porygon tues or any Pokemon with download their one of their attack stats is going to increase by a stage when they're set out so either attack or special attack and that is determined by whatever your opponent's lowest defense stat is so if your opponent has a lower defense porygon tues attack will increase and similarly if it has a lower special defense it's special attack will increase and now you're not going to get anything out of an attack stat increase because you're not running any physical attacks having that special attack bonus is huge being able to come in with already boosted up a stage you're going to deal a lot of damage and you didn't have to invest any v's into special attacks so you have a whole bunch of bulk you're dealing decent damage and I'm that's the perfect combination right and because your trick room you're also going first so that's pretty devastating it's worth noting that in a double battle download adds the two opposing Pokemon stats to calculate which of the defense stats is lower for determining a which stat of porygon choose to increase trace on the other hand is an ability that copies the opponent's ability as it goes in so it's a similar ability that takes effect as you're sending in porygon too and people don't typically use it over download because one it's a very unpredictable you don't necessarily know what you're gonna copy to you could conceivably copy something bad that's not really gonna happen a lot because there aren't many abilities that are good enough for people to run them but would be so bad for your porygon to to get that it would actually be a detriment to you um but mainly it's just that the number of abilities that are just okay to mediocre to get are numerous and although the number of abilities that are very very great are used fairly often in VGC so that's what you're really aiming for if you're running trace you want to counter something like excuse me you're looking to counter something like a and intimidate or maybe even competitive to counter intimidate or something like that which can be quite powerful because like we mentioned before on earlier episodes Pokemon of the week segments that intimidate and competitive are both incredibly good abilities in VGT so yeah most people aren't going to be running trace in fact according to pcola decks over ninety percent of people use download just because the the negative result of download is kind of just neutral and the positive outcome is very good um there's some argument to be aid to run trace do you think we've covered things well enough folks sound think so good to me so a shiny porygon is blue instead of the pinkish red that it normally is porygon to is the only official Pokemon with a numeral in its name in generation two games it is impossible to return a nickname porygon to to its species name because the character to is not available as a character for nicknames it is the only pokemon that evolves that both evolves by trading and needs to be traded to evolve again porygon 2 is the only pokemon introduced after the generation of Esprit evolution that is able to evolve again like porygon it is based on a bird possibly an origami crane made with more advanced 3d computer graphics and the first porygon its head looks like a duck it also resembles a resembles a drinking bird especially in the 3d games where it makes the same movement as one the change in its form from pouring onto porygon 2 represents the concept of subdivision in 3d computer graphics so there you go poor don't even understand what that means but sure program to is really cool yep the whole poor guideline is really great there's your poking out of the week a little bit of housecleaning real quick if you haven't done so already and you like the show please leave us a review in itunes it helps other people find the show easier if you take a couple seconds to leave us a review we don't have packs coming up but i will be at both midwest gaming classic m c2e2 I in the next couple weeks I will get you more details as we get closer to those events if you like what you hear and you want to support us you can head over to our patreon page patreon.com/lenguin I us on twitter at the travis w can i plug something else too yeah plug away yeah so three weeks ago now with Logan and Greg who y'all would know from either this podcast or mythical the sideshow to this show and also one of our other friends Lee we all started a new RPG podcast called very random encounters and in some ways it's the complete inverse of what a typical role-playing experience is because a role-playing game is supposed to be this power fantasy where you get to be whoever you want to be well we turn that on its head because every single element of the game is randomly determined so our names our classes are races our ability scores everything and also all of the dungeons all of the monsters everything is randomly determined so the characters have very little control over what happens in their lives and it just becomes a bit of a comedy of errors it's a lot of fun unfortunately my character's name is zeg Milne which is not a real thing very random encounters an iTunes could go play all that awesome check that out will is at wash in the sink on twitter i am at dragging a lake and if you want to stay up to date with the podcast at pokemon podcast on twitter thank you all so much for listening thank you everyone who came out to our pack show and thank you everyone who supports the show it means a lot
