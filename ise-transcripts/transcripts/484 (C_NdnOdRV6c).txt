[Music] (0:22 - 0:28)
what's up everyone welcome to the 484th (0:26 - 0:31)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:28 - 0:33)
super effective i'm your host sbj with (0:31 - 0:38)
me is jive master craig (0:33 - 0:38)
uh grand master jive greg thank you very (0:39 - 0:43)
much (0:42 - 0:47)
also up-and-coming tick-tock star so (0:43 - 0:48)
yep (0:47 - 0:50)
you're all in now i am (0:48 - 0:53)
i am starting my media empire (0:50 - 0:54)
i (0:53 - 0:59)
will soon take over all of the shows (0:54 - 1:00)
please do (0:59 - 1:03)
all of the shows i don't know (1:00 - 1:06)
the the shows uh not to be confused with (1:03 - 1:10)
jive but vibe master will is here well (1:06 - 1:11)
i'm (1:10 - 1:13)
increasingly fading into irrelevance as (1:11 - 1:14)
greg (1:13 - 1:16)
has now mastered tick tock and both of (1:14 - 1:19)
you create your own tick tocks and i (1:16 - 1:21)
do less and less with social media as (1:19 - 1:24)
the days go on (1:21 - 1:26)
i know i can i can appreciate it though (1:24 - 1:28)
i'm gonna have a hard time (1:26 - 1:31)
focusing on the program today because i (1:28 - 1:33)
i'm pondering two very deep questions (1:31 - 1:35)
that i like you know you ever have a (1:33 - 1:37)
question that gets stuck in your head (1:35 - 1:38)
and then you're like (1:37 - 1:41)
i i there's no answer but i can't stop (1:38 - 1:43)
thinking about the question (1:41 - 1:45)
yes that's where i am what is the (1:43 - 1:47)
question well there's two of them but (1:45 - 1:49)
it's one of the questions if i send them (1:47 - 1:50)
out to the listeners then (1:49 - 1:52)
then they're going to get mentally stuck (1:50 - 1:53)
did we not talk about how your (1:52 - 1:56)
superpower is corrupting others (1:53 - 1:58)
all right so the easier one which (1:56 - 2:00)
probably somebody could solve with a (1:58 - 2:01)
little bit of research (2:00 - 2:03)
is (2:01 - 2:05)
do animals (2:03 - 2:07)
in the wild (2:05 - 2:08)
ever (2:07 - 2:12)
die from choking on eating food (2:08 - 2:14)
or is that only a problem that human (2:12 - 2:16)
beings have because of our own personal (2:14 - 2:19)
issues and the way we eat (2:16 - 2:21)
i mean you can google search that i'm (2:19 - 2:24)
not sure i can why (2:21 - 2:26)
and then the more difficult more (2:24 - 2:29)
philosophical question is (2:26 - 2:32)
let me start by saying that every night (2:29 - 2:34)
when i go to bed i listen to calm at the (2:32 - 2:37)
comm app i listen to sleep stories (2:34 - 2:40)
not sponsored not sponsored but (2:37 - 2:44)
i because i spent 70 a year on the com (2:40 - 2:45)
app (2:44 - 2:48)
am i wasting my money because i have not (2:45 - 2:50)
once heard more than the first (2:48 - 2:53)
30 seconds of one of these sleep stories (2:50 - 2:57)
and they always start the same (2:53 - 2:59)
i mean if it's putting you to sleep (2:57 - 3:01)
oh it certainly is but (2:59 - 3:03)
i'm paying for the full story i'm not (3:01 - 3:05)
getting the full story i mean some (3:03 - 3:08)
people (3:05 - 3:10)
this is this is uh a real thing some (3:08 - 3:12)
people fall asleep to different tv shows (3:10 - 3:14)
futurama being a very popular one (3:12 - 3:16)
the simpsons was very popular for a very (3:14 - 3:19)
long time was popular with me (3:16 - 3:22)
uh and hey if it works it works (3:19 - 3:24)
i don't know (3:22 - 3:27)
does it 70 work or can i just call greg (3:24 - 3:29)
and say greg please tell me to get into (3:27 - 3:31)
a comfortable position take a deep (3:29 - 3:33)
breath i could do this for you (3:31 - 3:36)
[Laughter] (3:33 - 3:38)
i mean as long as i'm not in bed because (3:36 - 3:40)
i need (3:38 - 3:41)
nothing (3:40 - 3:44)
to fall asleep i crawl into bed i'm like (3:41 - 3:45)
oh (3:44 - 3:48)
it's cup (3:45 - 3:49)
and i'm out i don't need any of these (3:48 - 3:52)
columns i don't need any of these tv (3:49 - 3:53)
shows (3:52 - 3:56)
i just need to lie down (3:53 - 3:59)
must be nice (3:56 - 4:00)
i fall asleep pretty quick too (3:59 - 4:03)
usually within 20 minutes yeah but the (4:00 - 4:06)
tv stays on all night yeah (4:03 - 4:08)
there's a sleep timer (4:06 - 4:10)
usually like a hotel room (4:08 - 4:11)
well sometimes those hotels don't have (4:10 - 4:14)
the timer correct i've been in those (4:11 - 4:15)
hotel rooms (4:14 - 4:17)
with you (4:15 - 4:20)
i don't understand the issue right now (4:17 - 4:23)
speaking of issues we have pokemon news (4:20 - 4:27)
uh let's start with the (4:23 - 4:28)
i don't know some people are into it (4:27 - 4:30)
some people are not into it let's start (4:28 - 4:31)
with pokemon unite (4:30 - 4:34)
there's a halloween event it's so good (4:31 - 4:37)
halloween brings pumpkins to pokemon (4:34 - 4:39)
unites mere stadium if you forgot the (4:37 - 4:43)
stadium has a name it's mere m-e-r (4:39 - 4:45)
you will find pumpkins apparently poke (4:43 - 4:47)
in pokemon unite with the arrival of the (4:45 - 4:50)
eos islands halloween celebration (4:47 - 4:53)
from october 20th through november 10th (4:50 - 4:55)
the game will feature all sorts of (4:53 - 4:57)
tricks and tricks including a fun new (4:55 - 4:59)
take on mere stadium battles special (4:57 - 5:01)
bonuses that earn you pumpkins and a (4:59 - 5:03)
festive new way to deck out your trainer (5:01 - 5:05)
and pokemon don't be surprised if the (5:03 - 5:09)
game looks a little spookier than usual (5:05 - 5:09)
uh (5:09 - 5:12)
greg what do you think of this pumpkin (5:13 - 5:16)
event (5:15 - 5:18)
i love it (5:16 - 5:19)
it's (5:18 - 5:22)
it makes no sense (5:19 - 5:24)
but it's a lot of fun turning people (5:22 - 5:27)
into pumpkins and then pushing them away (5:24 - 5:29)
or being a pumpkin and ramming into (5:27 - 5:32)
people as a pumpkin (5:29 - 5:34)
are they charging are they how much are (5:32 - 5:35)
they charging for these skins these (5:34 - 5:39)
pagan skins that sounds (5:35 - 5:39)
look it's quick battles so they're only (5:39 - 5:44)
five minutes you fly through them (5:41 - 5:46)
it doesn't affect your rank so (5:44 - 5:50)
nobody's really a try hard (5:46 - 5:53)
people are just like whipping pumpkins (5:50 - 5:54)
charging each other (5:53 - 5:56)
it it's it's fun (5:54 - 5:59)
it is fun um i i like it a lot although (5:56 - 6:00)
i could understand why people get (5:59 - 6:02)
frustrated because they're probably (6:00 - 6:03)
applying the strategies that they use in (6:02 - 6:05)
rank to this and it's not the same yeah (6:03 - 6:09)
no so i learned that like one match in (6:05 - 6:11)
like oh wait there's a pumpkin button (6:09 - 6:12)
what does it do (6:11 - 6:15)
why am i a pumpkin why is all of my orbs (6:12 - 6:17)
spraying out of my body when i'm a (6:15 - 6:20)
pumpkin it also um (6:17 - 6:21)
i guess if you're serious about the (6:20 - 6:23)
pumpkin event uh kind of makes you (6:21 - 6:25)
consider using different items like (6:23 - 6:27)
square shield would probably like if (6:25 - 6:28)
you're like every pokemon should (6:27 - 6:29)
probably be running squareshield for (6:28 - 6:30)
this event (6:29 - 6:33)
um or (6:30 - 6:35)
uh (6:33 - 6:36)
whatever (6:35 - 6:38)
whatever other items that are good for (6:36 - 6:40)
scoring or like maybe goal getter or (6:38 - 6:41)
something (6:40 - 6:43)
uh but more importantly (6:41 - 6:45)
the way you play is different because (6:43 - 6:47)
when you get hit with a pumpkin you drop (6:45 - 6:50)
all your aos orbs (6:47 - 6:53)
gems orbs orbs um (6:50 - 6:56)
so instead of trying to like (6:53 - 6:59)
stop somebody who probably has (6:56 - 7:01)
scoreshield you just throw a pumpkin at (6:59 - 7:04)
them yeah and hope you don't miss (7:01 - 7:07)
yeah and so like instead of like trying (7:04 - 7:10)
to you you just prioritize oh this dude (7:07 - 7:11)
has 40 (7:10 - 7:13)
aoes on him so i'm just gonna pumpkin (7:11 - 7:14)
him (7:13 - 7:15)
and if you think about it that way (7:14 - 7:17)
instead of just trying to play the game (7:15 - 7:19)
normally i feel like you will have (7:17 - 7:21)
a more enjoyable time (7:19 - 7:23)
and if you want to be a good teammate (7:21 - 7:26)
which is impossible to find in pokemon (7:23 - 7:30)
unite and your teammate has 40 aos gems (7:26 - 7:32)
you step in front of them so you take (7:30 - 7:33)
the pumpkin (7:32 - 7:35)
and they don't it's like a very easy (7:33 - 7:38)
like once you understand that this one (7:35 - 7:40)
mechanic they added which apparently no (7:38 - 7:42)
one has understood it and figured it out (7:40 - 7:45)
uh it makes the game really easy to win (7:42 - 7:46)
uh (7:45 - 7:47)
because you're just playing slightly (7:46 - 7:49)
differently (7:47 - 7:51)
uh but it's fun i don't know so there's (7:49 - 7:53)
something about (7:51 - 7:54)
because when you get turned into a (7:53 - 7:56)
pumpkin you can still attack (7:54 - 7:58)
yeah and when you attack you're like (7:56 - 8:00)
throwing the other person across the map (7:58 - 8:01)
so again also (8:00 - 8:03)
good for blocking and defending your (8:01 - 8:05)
goals um (8:03 - 8:06)
but (8:05 - 8:09)
they can toss you too so that's the (8:06 - 8:10)
interesting part is once you pumpkin (8:09 - 8:12)
somebody your button turns into pumpkin (8:10 - 8:15)
toss so if you pumpkin then you can also (8:12 - 8:16)
shoot that pumpkin all the way across (8:15 - 8:19)
the universe not if they shoot you first (8:16 - 8:21)
yeah so it's a showdown it's a quick (8:19 - 8:23)
draw situation (8:21 - 8:24)
uh there was like a situation where i (8:23 - 8:25)
was playing slowbro and i did (8:24 - 8:28)
telekinesis which like picks him up but (8:25 - 8:30)
somebody also pumpkin pushed at the same (8:28 - 8:31)
time (8:30 - 8:32)
so like my telekinesis was still (8:31 - 8:34)
grabbing on and it was just like this (8:32 - 8:37)
huge psychic bar (8:34 - 8:37)
across the map and i was like this is (8:38 - 8:42)
this is perfect this is exactly the (8:40 - 8:44)
touch this is chaos i want this is the (8:42 - 8:47)
most chaotic thing they've added and (8:44 - 8:49)
it's also fun and you can earn greeden (8:47 - 8:51)
who is added (8:49 - 8:54)
yeah big chunky squirrel so i love the (8:51 - 8:57)
way that they redid the map (8:54 - 8:57)
with the (8:57 - 9:00)
yeah the spookiness of the pumpkins i (8:57 - 9:01)
wish they would have applied that to (9:00 - 9:03)
just standard (9:01 - 9:05)
um not the pumpkin stuff but just the (9:03 - 9:06)
look of the map (9:05 - 9:08)
i understand you wouldn't want to do it (9:06 - 9:10)
with ranked because you don't want to (9:08 - 9:12)
mess up those ranked players they can't (9:10 - 9:14)
see a pumpkin get all thrown off (9:12 - 9:15)
but (9:14 - 9:16)
it would have been nice if they applied (9:15 - 9:19)
that to standard there is um (9:16 - 9:22)
new costumes and new rewards and there (9:19 - 9:23)
is like a (9:22 - 9:24)
pumpkin (9:23 - 9:26)
uh what do they call that like mission (9:24 - 9:28)
and so like one of the missions is just (9:26 - 9:30)
log in every day if you log in for two (9:28 - 9:32)
weeks i think i added it up if you log (9:30 - 9:34)
in for two weeks you get like 55 (9:32 - 9:35)
pumpkins (9:34 - 9:37)
and then there's another one which is (9:35 - 9:38)
like (9:37 - 9:40)
play five battles on this map play five (9:38 - 9:43)
battles on this map win three matches (9:40 - 9:45)
win three matches play with a friend (9:43 - 9:46)
play with a friend so i think if you add (9:45 - 9:48)
all those up that's like another like 30 (9:46 - 9:51)
or 40 pumpkins and then you can use (9:48 - 9:54)
those pumpkins to get greedant and green (9:51 - 9:56)
i think is 70 pumpkins and then there's (9:54 - 9:58)
like the witch hat which is like ten and (9:56 - 10:00)
then there's like the um (9:58 - 10:02)
profile banner which is like five so you (10:00 - 10:05)
can use those pumpkins to (10:02 - 10:08)
get a variety of rewards (10:05 - 10:09)
they did tweet that (10:08 - 10:10)
if (10:09 - 10:12)
it's possible for you not to get all the (10:10 - 10:15)
rewards even if you do something because (10:12 - 10:18)
if you just did the login and you just (10:15 - 10:19)
did the missions (10:18 - 10:22)
you will still be i think like 20 (10:19 - 10:24)
pumpkins short of everything (10:22 - 10:26)
so if you don't buy greed you can get (10:24 - 10:27)
everything else (10:26 - 10:29)
if you do buy greet it you can only get (10:27 - 10:31)
like three of the five other items (10:29 - 10:34)
which is probably fine (10:31 - 10:36)
but there are you can this is a really (10:34 - 10:39)
silly thing you can take (10:36 - 10:42)
pumpkins and exchange them for (10:39 - 10:44)
pumpkin boxes (10:42 - 10:46)
and the pumpkin boxes can give you (10:44 - 10:49)
anywhere between one to fifty pumpkins i (10:46 - 10:50)
think it costs two pumpkins for a (10:49 - 10:52)
pumpkin box (10:50 - 10:54)
but there's like a sixty percent chance (10:52 - 10:56)
that the pumpkin box has one pumpkin so (10:54 - 10:58)
yeah there's a 60 chance you're (10:56 - 11:01)
exchanging two pumpkins for one now if (10:58 - 11:03)
you were to open one of those pumpkin (11:01 - 11:05)
boxes and get like the 50 pumpkins (11:03 - 11:07)
you won you have you now have enough to (11:05 - 11:09)
get everything (11:07 - 11:10)
um (11:09 - 11:12)
and they give you two of those pumpkin (11:10 - 11:15)
boxes i think for free (11:12 - 11:17)
i opened my two free ones and i got one (11:15 - 11:19)
pumpkin each (11:17 - 11:20)
which is the (11:19 - 11:23)
the highest thing you can get i ended up (11:20 - 11:24)
with (11:23 - 11:26)
four somehow (11:24 - 11:30)
and i got one two two (11:26 - 11:32)
and a three i think (11:30 - 11:34)
oh okay (11:32 - 11:36)
so you don't know how i got four i know (11:34 - 11:38)
i got two for free and i'm like how did (11:36 - 11:40)
i get two others i think there's two for (11:38 - 11:41)
each map so i only played one of the (11:40 - 11:44)
maps oh okay (11:41 - 11:45)
um (11:44 - 11:47)
so that i mean that's it's cool that (11:45 - 11:49)
they gave a way to get greedant (11:47 - 11:51)
um it's pretty easy to get the 70 (11:49 - 11:52)
pumpkins if you just like play like two (11:51 - 11:55)
matches a day (11:52 - 11:56)
appreciate you can buy it with coins (11:55 - 11:58)
also yeah you can just buy ingredients (11:56 - 12:00)
you can just buy it with coins (11:58 - 12:01)
i mean what else you can do with these (12:00 - 12:03)
pumpkins (12:01 - 12:06)
get everything else (12:03 - 12:09)
save them for next year's event (12:06 - 12:09)
it's it's a it's a cool event i'm glad (12:11 - 12:14)
they did something halloween related uh (12:13 - 12:16)
greeting came out ingredient i was (12:14 - 12:18)
already banned in competitive play (12:16 - 12:21)
there's a bunch of big fan made ranked (12:18 - 12:22)
tournaments or whatever with money on (12:21 - 12:24)
the line and they've already banned (12:22 - 12:26)
greed it from that because there's some (12:24 - 12:27)
bug where (12:26 - 12:28)
i don't know i don't know what it is (12:27 - 12:31)
exactly but it banks (12:28 - 12:33)
incredibly overpowered i just love (12:31 - 12:36)
pokemon fans always the first ones like (12:33 - 12:37)
we're not gonna take the rules that (12:36 - 12:39)
we're given we're gonna make our own (12:37 - 12:41)
rules (12:39 - 12:42)
well i mean (12:41 - 12:44)
in a tournament with money and a brand (12:42 - 12:46)
new character that's been out for (12:44 - 12:48)
five days now (12:46 - 12:49)
there's something wrong with them i (12:48 - 12:50)
don't know what it is there was some (12:49 - 12:53)
weird bug with crustal like a month ago (12:50 - 12:54)
where (12:53 - 12:56)
crustal could take advantage of some (12:54 - 12:59)
jump pad in a way where it would mess up (12:56 - 13:00)
the game (12:59 - 13:03)
and they actually fixed that in i think (13:00 - 13:04)
it they fixed it in less than a week the (13:03 - 13:07)
unite team did but i don't exactly (13:04 - 13:08)
remember what the (13:07 - 13:10)
crystal (13:08 - 13:12)
bug was well kressel is a bug but i (13:10 - 13:13)
don't know what the (13:12 - 13:14)
uh (13:13 - 13:16)
i don't know what people players were (13:14 - 13:18)
doing to take advantage of it (13:16 - 13:20)
i'm sure there's a youtube video about (13:18 - 13:21)
it somewhere of how to do it and how (13:20 - 13:24)
they fixed it (13:21 - 13:24)
i have watched people play greed it i (13:25 - 13:29)
don't understand how that character (13:28 - 13:31)
works he's like throwing berries (13:29 - 13:32)
everywhere he's like shooting some (13:31 - 13:33)
bullet seeds he's like eating the (13:32 - 13:36)
berries blowing berries up (13:33 - 13:40)
there's a whole berry exchange thing (13:36 - 13:40)
yeah seems like a lot of berry (13:42 - 13:47)
management that i'm not into (13:43 - 13:47)
they also released uh like a halloween (13:48 - 13:53)
outfit they released a zera aura outfit (13:50 - 13:56)
which is just like a halloween i don't (13:53 - 13:57)
know vest i don't know what to call it (13:56 - 13:59)
but (13:57 - 14:02)
the it was i think priced at 600 gems (13:59 - 14:03)
and then there's like a strike through (14:02 - 14:05)
it and it's only 60 gems which is a (14:03 - 14:06)
dollar (14:05 - 14:10)
um 60 gems is one dollar usd (14:06 - 14:12)
but that's limited time and then they (14:10 - 14:16)
did the thing again which (14:12 - 14:19)
is not unexpected because i've played (14:16 - 14:20)
other (14:19 - 14:22)
games that do this (14:20 - 14:24)
i'm just gonna mention apex legends (14:22 - 14:26)
where they've charged twenty dollars for (14:24 - 14:29)
a skin for your character and twenty (14:26 - 14:31)
dollars for a gun skin for your (14:29 - 14:32)
character that you might not even see (14:31 - 14:34)
that gun in the match and even if you do (14:32 - 14:35)
pick it up no one else is gonna see that (14:34 - 14:37)
gun skin because you're gonna be dead (14:35 - 14:38)
before you walk up to that person (14:37 - 14:40)
but (14:38 - 14:43)
uh since day one apex legend (14:40 - 14:45)
players have been these prices are too (14:43 - 14:47)
high change these prices it's been over (14:45 - 14:49)
two years they have not changed those (14:47 - 14:51)
prices they have doubled down on those (14:49 - 14:53)
prices respawn has somebody's spending (14:51 - 14:55)
that money somebody's doing it spending (14:53 - 14:57)
that money (14:55 - 15:00)
so pokemon unite released another 40 (14:57 - 15:03)
skin this one is for lucario and let me (15:00 - 15:05)
tell you i have seen a lot of people (15:03 - 15:08)
running around with this 40 lucario skin (15:05 - 15:09)
so (15:08 - 15:11)
i get it i get that some people (15:09 - 15:13)
including myself forty dollars is a lot (15:11 - 15:15)
for a skin if they were to release a (15:13 - 15:17)
cramer ant skin for forty dollars i hate (15:15 - 15:19)
to say i would be that person that would (15:17 - 15:21)
buy it why (15:19 - 15:23)
why that is it's a freaking pokemon i've (15:21 - 15:25)
gotten it's a free game i've gotten more (15:23 - 15:27)
than enough enjoyment out of it to spend (15:25 - 15:30)
40 dollars (15:27 - 15:30)
i've played it for three months now (15:30 - 15:35)
some people love goofy some people love (15:33 - 15:37)
donald duck (15:35 - 15:39)
look i bought some people hate money (15:37 - 15:42)
apparently i bought a 30 dollar moogle (15:39 - 15:44)
mount in final fantasy so i could sit on (15:42 - 15:45)
a (15:44 - 15:47)
bench with somebody else in a movie yeah (15:45 - 15:48)
and you don't even play yeah you're (15:47 - 15:50)
playing play that game anymore but if i (15:48 - 15:52)
did i got that thirty dollar moogle (15:50 - 15:53)
mountain yeah but here's the thing about (15:52 - 15:55)
the 30 rogue mount (15:53 - 15:57)
anybody else in the game a can see it (15:55 - 16:00)
and b also use it with you it is yes (15:57 - 16:02)
you can at least see the you're forced (16:00 - 16:04)
to see that person for 10 minutes you're (16:02 - 16:09)
forced to know that person spent 40. (16:04 - 16:09)
searching them out to destroy them how's (16:10 - 16:14)
that forty dollars now because i'm going (16:12 - 16:16)
to take you off the map for a growing (16:14 - 16:18)
amount of time (16:16 - 16:18)
i don't think they're changing the (16:18 - 16:22)
prices based on how many fancy nine (16:19 - 16:24)
tails i've seen and how many forty (16:22 - 16:26)
dollar lucario's i've seen (16:24 - 16:27)
it they're they're selling it it's (16:26 - 16:30)
working (16:27 - 16:32)
like that it did (16:30 - 16:34)
i don't know i like i don't like it but (16:32 - 16:37)
that's the thing about these games is (16:34 - 16:40)
somebody's gonna buy it (16:37 - 16:43)
like i just think of people who just (16:40 - 16:45)
continue to buy incubators over (16:43 - 16:49)
bobby over and over again and it's they (16:45 - 16:51)
get nothing they i just did a (16:49 - 16:53)
instagram video of hatching like nine (16:51 - 16:57)
eggs literally garbage actually garbage (16:53 - 17:00)
it was all garbage and it's like who (16:57 - 17:03)
kissed continue to buy like at least (17:00 - 17:04)
with the forty dollar skin (17:03 - 17:06)
it's like permanent (17:04 - 17:08)
for is if it's your favorite character (17:06 - 17:11)
in the game well sure or the character (17:08 - 17:13)
you're splurging the forty dollars (17:11 - 17:14)
you're running with that for look i got (17:13 - 17:16)
like 700 games with cramer ant i can do (17:14 - 17:19)
another 700 and i'd be happy to do that (17:16 - 17:21)
by paying another 40 (17:19 - 17:23)
what am i gonna do with a two star (17:21 - 17:25)
larvitar that i'm patched out of a team (17:23 - 17:26)
rocket egg (17:25 - 17:28)
threw it away right away because (17:26 - 17:30)
literally useless but it's it's not even (17:28 - 17:32)
that it's the fact that like i (17:30 - 17:35)
i i am the pokemon go minimalist i play (17:32 - 17:38)
the barest minimum of pokemon go every (17:35 - 17:40)
day to be able to call myself a pokemon (17:38 - 17:42)
go player and i still hatch (17:40 - 17:45)
one egg a day (17:42 - 17:48)
how many eggs do you need to hatch (17:45 - 17:51)
you know i just like what's the rush one (17:48 - 17:54)
egg a day is good that's good (17:51 - 17:56)
oh you got that double hatch candy right (17:54 - 17:58)
now i am proposing and i'm gonna propose (17:56 - 18:00)
a new rule for life for people (17:58 - 18:02)
[Laughter] (18:00 - 18:05)
it is an if then statement that you must (18:02 - 18:07)
apply to your life (18:05 - 18:11)
if you have spent forty dollars on a (18:07 - 18:14)
lucario or alolan nine (18:11 - 18:16)
skin (18:14 - 18:17)
you then (18:16 - 18:20)
you cannot complain about billionaires (18:17 - 18:22)
launching themselves into space and not (18:20 - 18:25)
solving society's issues (18:22 - 18:27)
because you have made (18:25 - 18:31)
in the ratio of income to expenditure (18:27 - 18:33)
the same decision (18:31 - 18:36)
that thirty dollars (18:33 - 18:38)
could have fed someone (18:36 - 18:40)
somewhere (18:38 - 18:44)
for a week okay (18:40 - 18:45)
look i (18:44 - 18:47)
you heard it here lucario skin equals (18:45 - 18:50)
shooting a billionaire into space i have (18:47 - 18:50)
made (18:50 - 18:52)
the correct (18:50 - 18:55)
very clear and understandable uh all (18:52 - 18:58)
i'll inquiries can go to at washington (18:55 - 19:00)
twitter you will only do it once and you (18:58 - 19:03)
will be blocked go ahead (19:00 - 19:06)
go ahead and shoot it off now get it in (19:03 - 19:07)
because he still has to see it to know (19:06 - 19:08)
to block you (19:07 - 19:11)
great so are you're telling me that if (19:08 - 19:13)
they added roselia to the game and they (19:11 - 19:16)
added a 40 roselia skin you wouldn't buy (19:13 - 19:19)
it i would not buy it you would not buy (19:16 - 19:21)
it no (19:19 - 19:24)
40 bucks what if it was a really cute (19:21 - 19:24)
result (19:24 - 19:26)
what if it was good but see because (19:24 - 19:28)
greg's also smart because he he knows (19:26 - 19:30)
i've run out of ideas of things to get (19:28 - 19:32)
him for his birthday and so when his (19:30 - 19:34)
birthday comes around i'll be like here (19:32 - 19:35)
you go (19:34 - 19:37)
kid i feel like if you're asking for the (19:35 - 19:40)
40 skin just so you don't buy it i feel (19:37 - 19:42)
like that's some weird loophole you're (19:40 - 19:43)
getting through here how is that a (19:42 - 19:46)
loophole that is that is the nature of (19:43 - 19:48)
most gifts when you're an adult i don't (19:46 - 19:50)
want to buy this for myself because i'm (19:48 - 19:53)
responsible (19:50 - 19:53)
perfect greg literally has a blackout (19:53 - 19:58)
period where he's not allowed to buy (19:56 - 20:01)
things for himself for his birthday that (19:58 - 20:03)
so that or or before christmas (20:01 - 20:05)
i cannot buy anything for myself (20:03 - 20:08)
starting november 25 and i cannot buy (20:05 - 20:11)
anything of myself starting april 19th (20:08 - 20:13)
these are the laws that's established by (20:11 - 20:15)
my friends and family because i will buy (20:13 - 20:17)
stuff for myself and i'm not allowed to (20:15 - 20:19)
because i'm quote unquote too hard to (20:17 - 20:21)
shop for (20:19 - 20:22)
you've done both battle passes though (20:21 - 20:23)
right (20:22 - 20:26)
yeah okay uh i'm pretty sure i'm not (20:23 - 20:28)
going to be able to finish this (20:26 - 20:32)
second battle pass 17 dead attitude (20:28 - 20:35)
23 of 60 and there's 17 days left i (20:32 - 20:37)
don't think i'm gonna finish (20:35 - 20:38)
so much time recording podcasts when you (20:37 - 20:40)
could be in pokemon united you haven't (20:38 - 20:42)
gotta be moving (20:40 - 20:46)
uh it's fine um (20:42 - 20:46)
it is competing with the mughal tomes (20:46 - 20:51)
that are now in final fantasy 14. (20:48 - 20:52)
there's a lot for me to do and not a lot (20:51 - 20:54)
of time to do it in (20:52 - 20:55)
that's right you got to pick and choose (20:54 - 20:57)
your battles ugh (20:55 - 20:59)
uh we talked about green and being (20:57 - 21:00)
available (20:59 - 21:01)
yep (21:00 - 21:03)
uh which was a rumored character or not (21:01 - 21:06)
a rumored but a quote unquote data mine (21:03 - 21:07)
character a while ago where it was like (21:06 - 21:10)
greed and sylveon and blastoise i think (21:07 - 21:12)
were the three (21:10 - 21:13)
uh i don't think we have any more data (21:12 - 21:15)
mined characters at this point so i (21:13 - 21:17)
guess any new character would actually (21:15 - 21:20)
come at a surprise (21:17 - 21:20)
i (21:21 - 21:23)
would assume they're going to do like a (21:21 - 21:25)
christmas event for (21:23 - 21:27)
yeah yeah the halloween event so i don't (21:25 - 21:28)
see why they wouldn't do a christmas (21:27 - 21:29)
event i don't know about thanksgiving (21:28 - 21:32)
though uh you mean festival of lights (21:29 - 21:35)
thanksgiving is a very (21:32 - 21:38)
specific american thing (21:35 - 21:43)

in in the u.s you have to say the name (41:15 - 41:19)

you and you think you went out of town (42:39 - 42:44)
well theoretically they were bringing it (42:42 - 42:47)
to me but then the pandemic happened (42:44 - 42:49)
so uh before we move out i'm a little (42:47 - 42:51)
confused because (42:49 - 42:53)
these aren't the places that it used to (42:51 - 42:54)
be (42:53 - 42:57)
uh milwaukee these i think these were (42:54 - 42:58)
the places that were theoretically (42:57 - 43:00)
scheduled before salt lake city was (42:58 - 43:02)
always an option i'm not sure about (43:00 - 43:05)
orlando i always thought it was tampa (43:02 - 43:07)
um but (43:05 - 43:09)
milwaukee was so it was madison for (43:07 - 43:11)
several years in wisconsin and then they (43:09 - 43:12)
switched it to milwaukee but then the (43:11 - 43:14)
pandemic happened because i know like (43:12 - 43:16)
the big ones (43:14 - 43:19)
st louis was always a big one fort wayne (43:16 - 43:21)

countries florida milwaukee and canada (44:54 - 45:00)
countries (44:58 - 45:02)
i mean i mean we wish florida was a (45:00 - 45:04)
country so we could literally say nah (45:02 - 45:06)
thanks (45:04 - 45:10)
but we're not that lucky (45:06 - 45:10)
um (45:10 - 45:14)
yeah i mean like i have been playing vgc (45:12 - 45:17)
for over a year and i feel like i'm okay (45:14 - 45:18)
at it (45:17 - 45:20)
so i want to go up on stage and be okay (45:18 - 45:24)
at it yeah and i i feel like i'm um (45:20 - 45:27)
i've i felt like i was okay at the tcg i (45:24 - 45:29)
mean i top cut into regionals before (45:27 - 45:30)
uh (45:29 - 45:32)
i feel like i'm okay at pogo (45:30 - 45:34)
you can see my pogo streams on tuesday (45:32 - 45:36)
night where i dominate little little (45:34 - 45:39)
halloween cup (45:36 - 45:42)

i'm like 20 and 10 right now for (45:42 - 45:46)
halloween (45:44 - 45:47)
it's going to sync up and i'm going to (45:46 - 45:49)
be able to do a live (45:47 - 45:53)
tick tock commentating on you (45:49 - 45:55)
i just need a thousand followers that i (45:53 - 45:57)
could go live i think that i think it's (45:55 - 45:59)
not even about winning at these events i (45:57 - 46:01)
think it's more i want to just go to the (45:59 - 46:02)
events because they're pokemon events (46:01 - 46:05)
and i like i do like competing (46:02 - 46:07)
uh even though i (46:05 - 46:09)
probably won't qualify (46:07 - 46:11)
um not with that attitude come on dude (46:09 - 46:13)
you can do it i believe in you but look (46:11 - 46:15)
i i competed for three years straight (46:13 - 46:17)
with the tcg yeah but that's back when (46:15 - 46:21)
you sucked yeah it was bad uh i did (46:17 - 46:23)
qualify or i did cop cut that regionals (46:21 - 46:25)
um i feel like i'm a much better player (46:23 - 46:26)
now (46:25 - 46:29)
and i feel like (46:26 - 46:30)
that even though that burnt me out (46:29 - 46:32)
competing like every single weekend (46:30 - 46:34)
going to a tournament and trying to (46:32 - 46:36)
qualify and trying to get points and (46:34 - 46:37)
having enough points (46:36 - 46:39)
um (46:37 - 46:41)
i feel like going to two big tournaments (46:39 - 46:43)
a year is way less stressful and (46:41 - 46:47)
probably been way more uh chewable (46:43 - 46:49)
than (46:47 - 46:51)
trying to get every single tournament (46:49 - 46:53)
every week yeah i (46:51 - 46:55)
one of the things that has always super (46:53 - 46:58)
turned me off about competitive pokemon (46:55 - 47:01)
um especially in the tcg is is the the (46:58 - 47:04)
need to grind for points (47:01 - 47:06)
to get invites and everything and i'm (47:04 - 47:07)
like (47:06 - 47:09)
i i have too much (47:07 - 47:12)
life that is not pokemon (47:09 - 47:14)
to be driving around the country share (47:12 - 47:16)
at a hotel room with eight other dudes (47:14 - 47:18)
so that we can all go to some small like (47:16 - 47:20)
shop tournament that's going to give us (47:18 - 47:23)
10 points each or something stupid (47:20 - 47:26)
no but yeah i mean going to regionals is (47:23 - 47:28)
fun you know getting to compete and meet (47:26 - 47:30)
people and everything that's enjoyable (47:28 - 47:33)
but the points grind (47:30 - 47:35)
it's crazy how much time competitive (47:33 - 47:37)
stuff takes (47:35 - 47:38)
yeah um (47:37 - 47:40)
like because it's not only going to the (47:38 - 47:42)
tournaments you got to practice you got (47:40 - 47:44)
to get the all this stuff in your blood (47:42 - 47:45)
you got to know what's coming up what's (47:44 - 47:47)
what to expect you got to study the meta (47:45 - 47:51)
who's got i got a job (47:47 - 47:51)
i just and just knowing information is (47:52 - 47:55)
is just so important like in the in vgc (47:53 - 47:57)
if i see a pokemon i don't know what it (47:55 - 47:58)
does (47:57 - 47:59)
they have an advantage that's the same (47:58 - 48:01)
in the card game too like you know if if (47:59 - 48:03)
you're used to playing against russia (48:01 - 48:05)
ram uh typhlosion (48:03 - 48:08)
or darkrai sableye you're like i know (48:05 - 48:09)
what these decks do i know what their (48:08 - 48:11)
win condition is i know how they set up (48:09 - 48:14)
and all of a sudden if you see (48:11 - 48:16)
an el slogore in front of you and you're (48:14 - 48:19)
like uh can i uh can i read that card (48:16 - 48:21)
uh okay uh that makes sense i don't know (48:19 - 48:22)
what this is doing (48:21 - 48:24)
i'm not sure what i need to prioritize (48:22 - 48:27)
uh so yeah i mean just practicing and (48:24 - 48:28)
stuff like that it's very very time (48:27 - 48:30)
consuming but (48:28 - 48:31)
people like it (48:30 - 48:33)
uh it's cool that they're getting back (48:31 - 48:34)
to live events we did talk about this (48:33 - 48:36)
last week they they do require every one (48:34 - 48:39)
of their competitors to be vaccinated (48:36 - 48:41)
um i don't think there's i don't know (48:39 - 48:43)
how they're going to check that i don't (48:41 - 48:46)
know what the (48:43 - 48:48)
what i'd what the i have not been to an (48:46 - 48:50)
uh a place of business that has asked me (48:48 - 48:52)
for vaccination but i do know that (48:50 - 48:54)
summerfest in milwaukee which was like a (48:52 - 48:56)
seven day festival (48:54 - 48:58)
they were checking (48:56 - 49:00)
but i don't know how i mean i i went to (48:58 - 49:02)
a concert here and i had to bring my (49:00 - 49:04)
card and they did oh and you just had to (49:02 - 49:06)
show them yeah (49:04 - 49:07)
yeah okay (49:06 - 49:10)
that's what it would be here so (49:07 - 49:12)
some places so new york because it's new (49:10 - 49:13)
york (49:12 - 49:15)
set up an app where you can it's like (49:13 - 49:17)
your (49:15 - 49:17)
coven wallet so it's got a bunch of (49:18 - 49:22)
information so you don't have to carry (49:20 - 49:23)
the card with you and i've heard a lot (49:22 - 49:25)
of people just have that all right we (49:23 - 49:27)
don't have that here yeah yeah well i've (49:25 - 49:30)
heard that even locally if you download (49:27 - 49:32)
the new york app and you're doing it (49:30 - 49:33)
they will accept it (49:32 - 49:36)
like it's getting more widely adopted so (49:33 - 49:39)
they may adopt something like that (49:36 - 49:39)
uh i guess the big news of the week (49:43 - 49:48)
is that the so earlier in the (49:45 - 49:50)
earlier last week they showed this like (49:48 - 49:53)
one minute maybe two minute like static (49:50 - 49:56)
vcr trailer (49:53 - 49:59)
and i like skimmed it and this is why i (49:56 - 50:00)
skimmed it i'm gonna i'm gonna lay out (49:59 - 50:02)
right here i believe greg watched it and (50:00 - 50:03)
got very upset about it so great to (50:02 - 50:05)
maybe explain what happened i was on his (50:03 - 50:08)
tick tock i saw that on his tick tock (50:05 - 50:09)
i i (50:08 - 50:11)
upset about upset for entertainment (50:09 - 50:14)
value only let's be real i could not (50:11 - 50:16)
care about it i woke up i saw that there (50:14 - 50:18)
was this this trailer i was like oh (50:16 - 50:21)
maybe maybe i'll i'll watch it on stream (50:18 - 50:23)
or i'll like i can't watch it right now (50:21 - 50:24)
i'm like i don't i don't have the (50:23 - 50:26)
ability to turn the sound on i'm a (50:24 - 50:27)
little busy i'll watch it in a second (50:26 - 50:29)
and then i just you know i saw twitter (50:27 - 50:30)
freaking out about it and then (50:29 - 50:32)
speculating i saw people saying vulpix (50:30 - 50:34)
or arcanine or whatever (50:32 - 50:37)
and then i was like wait (50:34 - 50:39)
i'm not doing this again (50:37 - 50:42)
they have they did this all through (50:39 - 50:44)
sword and shield and it's fine it's like (50:42 - 50:45)
whatever it's like not a bad thing it's (50:44 - 50:46)
just (50:45 - 50:49)
i can't put any brain power towards (50:46 - 50:51)
their like hidden met (50:49 - 50:56)
this company had a 24-hour livestream (50:51 - 50:58)
and throughout that entire live stream (50:56 - 51:00)
ruined alex and katie's wedding because (50:58 - 51:03)
we were all glued to the livestream (51:00 - 51:06)
we could not attend the wedding as a (51:03 - 51:07)
matter of fact as i officiated the (51:06 - 51:10)
wedding i had an earpiece interview yeah (51:07 - 51:12)
that was letting me know live reactions (51:10 - 51:14)
when something happened and i would stop (51:12 - 51:16)
the wedding and look (51:14 - 51:18)
it was horrible (51:16 - 51:20)
it was it was it was lucky they paid you (51:18 - 51:22)
at the end honestly (51:20 - 51:23)
true (51:22 - 51:25)
um (51:23 - 51:25)
the i on paper (51:26 - 51:32)
uh our live stream to reveal a ponyta um (51:28 - 51:33)
i don't know if that sounded good on (51:32 - 51:37)
paper but that's what happened (51:33 - 51:39)
and so when i when i when i was like (51:37 - 51:40)
about to watch this trailer i was like (51:39 - 51:43)
wait a minute (51:40 - 51:44)
i'm just (51:43 - 51:45)
it's no (51:44 - 51:48)
no we're not doing this again (51:45 - 51:50)
they're going to announce what this (51:48 - 51:52)
pokemon is probably within the next (51:50 - 51:53)
month they happen to announce it like (51:52 - 51:55)
three days later i think three or four (51:53 - 51:57)
days later (51:55 - 52:00)
but i i i cannot fall down this rabbit (51:57 - 52:02)
hole of dedicating time towards this (52:00 - 52:06)
obscure piece of marketing material (52:02 - 52:10)
that they haven't obviously revealed for (52:06 - 52:14)
and i'm glad i didn't because (52:10 - 52:14)
i it was like three days later and they (52:14 - 52:19)
announced his suian (52:15 - 52:19)
and they showed the picture of it looks (52:20 - 52:24)
very cool they look awesome they're very (52:22 - 52:25)
yeah (52:24 - 52:27)
i mean zarua zoroark are two of my (52:25 - 52:30)
absolute favorites and then they these (52:27 - 52:34)
new ones look especially good (52:30 - 52:34)
it was like do you remember the (52:35 - 52:37)
far-fetched thing they did (52:36 - 52:39)
yeah like the website was corrupt oh (52:37 - 52:40)
yeah yeah yeah it was far-fetched but it (52:39 - 52:43)
was like turned sideways um (52:40 - 52:47)
i just can't i just don't have time but (52:43 - 52:50)
it's fun it's fun when you have time (52:47 - 52:52)
like i watched this i watched the (52:50 - 52:55)
what timeline are we in video found (52:52 - 52:57)
footage which was all spooky and then (52:55 - 52:58)
you were all like (52:57 - 53:00)
oh they totally killed that guy at the (52:58 - 53:01)
end (53:00 - 53:04)
and then when they revealed the actual (53:01 - 53:05)
footage they're like oh no they (53:04 - 53:07)
confirmed they totally killed the guy at (53:05 - 53:09)
the end of this video that dude's dead (53:07 - 53:12)
no he's not he died no (53:09 - 53:15)
he got his soul eaten by a shadow (53:12 - 53:17)
and then oh (53:15 - 53:18)
you never heard his footsteps running (53:17 - 53:21)
away in the slow he was dead (53:18 - 53:24)
no what i loved about the video actually (53:21 - 53:26)
is if you watch the first one that's all (53:24 - 53:29)
staticky you're like this is a horror (53:26 - 53:32)
this is blair witch this is super scary (53:29 - 53:33)
and then when you watch it and it's all (53:32 - 53:35)
cleared up it's like oh this is a (53:33 - 53:36)
delight he's having a nice (53:35 - 53:39)
walk in the snow until that dude dies at (53:36 - 53:41)
the end when he gets eaten by a shadow (53:39 - 53:44)
would you stop no because the reason why (53:41 - 53:46)
the zorro arc is taking the zuru away (53:44 - 53:48)
it's like that dude's still alive but i (53:46 - 53:50)
don't want you interacting with him so (53:48 - 53:51)
we're gonna walk otherwise they would (53:50 - 53:52)
have chowed down (53:51 - 53:54)
dear child don't do don't go play with (53:52 - 53:56)
that dead body just leave it leave it in (53:54 - 53:59)
the snow that's not how pokemon worked (53:56 - 54:03)
[Laughter] (53:59 - 54:03)
are we going to talk about their typing (54:05 - 54:11)
yeah so these are the first normal ghost (54:08 - 54:14)
type pokemon uh which means they're (54:11 - 54:16)
immune to ghost they're immune to (54:14 - 54:19)
fighting and they're immune to normal (54:16 - 54:21)
normal normal (54:19 - 54:23)
and so their only weakness is actually (54:21 - 54:24)
dark which is interesting because (54:23 - 54:27)
original zuru and zoroark are dark (54:24 - 54:28)
only (54:27 - 54:30)
also (54:28 - 54:33)
i i i like and hate the typing i hate it (54:30 - 54:34)
because (54:33 - 54:36)
normal is still so (54:34 - 54:41)
weirdly undefined as to what normal is (54:36 - 54:41)
and like normal ghosts (54:41 - 54:45)
yeah i (54:44 - 54:48)
i find it interesting i just i i'm never (54:45 - 54:50)
a fan of anything normal because i don't (54:48 - 54:52)
i i don't feel like we've ever really (54:50 - 54:54)
understood what normal stands for i'm (54:52 - 54:56)
sure one of your close friends will now (54:54 - 55:00)
have some strong words oh i know (54:56 - 55:03)
uh yeah it's (55:00 - 55:05)
normal's weird (55:03 - 55:05)
they are such a good design and also (55:06 - 55:11)
how do people draw that well that fast (55:11 - 55:15)
like (55:14 - 55:17)
the thing came up and five minutes later (55:15 - 55:19)
my twitter feed was like (55:17 - 55:22)
artwork that would have taken me (55:19 - 55:24)
50 hours to do and they're like i just (55:22 - 55:25)
whip this together (55:24 - 55:28)
in my morning doodle it is this gorgeous (55:25 - 55:30)
piece of work (55:28 - 55:30)
yeah we all have our gifts i know (55:31 - 55:36)
i'm still looking for mine i'm serious (55:34 - 55:39)
so are we (55:36 - 55:39)
still unsure what mine is here (55:39 - 55:43)
uh they look really cool i mean the (55:41 - 55:45)
typing is cool i i feel like there's (55:43 - 55:48)
there's a point where (55:45 - 55:51)
we have to get every type combination (55:48 - 55:53)
and so normal go (55:51 - 55:55)
yeah someday normal ghost was one of (55:53 - 55:56)
those things i i mean the interesting (55:55 - 55:58)
question is like zoroark's gimmick is (55:56 - 56:01)
its ability to copy (55:58 - 56:04)
uh other pokemon um so i (56:01 - 56:07)
don't is that still the case here (56:04 - 56:10)
um i i would say it's not that they're (56:07 - 56:13)
gonna have a different ability (56:10 - 56:13)
yeah (56:13 - 56:16)
because i feel like that's the signature (56:14 - 56:18)
part yeah them (56:16 - 56:20)
i didn't i was trying to think of what (56:18 - 56:21)
it would be (56:20 - 56:23)
like i can't (56:21 - 56:24)
i don't know if they'd go like the (56:23 - 56:25)
normal (56:24 - 56:27)
levitate ghost part but they were (56:25 - 56:30)
clearly like never levitating in now (56:27 - 56:31)
yeah the trailers are walking in the (56:30 - 56:34)
snow i mean as a ghost you can still (56:31 - 56:36)
intimidate or you can still (56:34 - 56:38)
not intimidate uh imitate (56:36 - 56:41)
yeah (56:38 - 56:41)
hmm (56:43 - 56:46)
interesting that there's (56:46 - 56:50)
i mean they showed an evolution for (56:48 - 56:52)
scyther gen one (56:50 - 56:54)
they showed an evolution for stantler (56:52 - 56:55)
gen two (56:54 - 56:57)
but then the other three pokemon are gen (56:55 - 56:59)
five so you got basket legion you got (56:57 - 57:02)
bravery and then you got zoroark gen (56:59 - 57:04)
five best gen there you go (57:02 - 57:06)
but also sword and shield has a bunch of (57:04 - 57:09)
gen five stuff in it as well (57:06 - 57:10)
like there's (57:09 - 57:12)
like if anything is missing from sword (57:10 - 57:14)
and shield it was it was (57:12 - 57:18)
diamond and pearl pokemon (57:14 - 57:19)
uh (57:18 - 57:21)
well how many how many new pokemon were (57:19 - 57:23)
introduced in gen five (57:21 - 57:25)
156 (57:23 - 57:29)
hmm wait completely new pokemon yeah oh (57:25 - 57:31)
yeah oh and gen fight i thought you said (57:29 - 57:34)
shield yes gen 5 was 156 new pokemon yep (57:31 - 57:35)
they put (57:34 - 57:38)
work in to get us our new pokes (57:35 - 57:40)
yep that's why when you catch a larvae (57:38 - 57:42)
you have to wait to level 732 for it to (57:40 - 57:44)
evolve (57:42 - 57:45)
listen (57:44 - 57:47)
we can stop (57:45 - 57:48)
with the volcarona hate (57:47 - 57:52)
right now (57:48 - 57:52)
the japanese website listed that it was (57:55 - 58:01)
ghost nor or normal ghost yeah but the (57:58 - 58:03)
the (58:01 - 58:05)
legends.pokemon.com the english website (58:03 - 58:07)
is not even updated yeah it's not even (58:05 - 58:10)
updating it which is really weird (58:07 - 58:12)
yeah it like they did a (58:10 - 58:14)
twitter slash youtube campaign (58:12 - 58:15)
with (58:14 - 58:17)
two-part like here's the (58:15 - 58:20)
teaser here's the pokemon (58:17 - 58:22)
why is the website not updated like i (58:20 - 58:24)
don't understand what is the point of (58:22 - 58:26)
your website the last time i checked the (58:24 - 58:30)
japanese website it hasn't been added to (58:26 - 58:32)
their main site it is just listed in the (58:30 - 58:34)
reveal (58:32 - 58:36)
section like they show the video and (58:34 - 58:37)
they talk about it (58:36 - 58:39)
but like i checked yesterday and it (58:37 - 58:41)
wasn't even (58:39 - 58:42)
in (58:41 - 58:44)
their listing of pokemon so i don't know (58:42 - 58:46)
what's going on with the websites (58:44 - 58:48)
cleaver was added i think a day or two (58:46 - 58:50)
after they yeah pretty quickly nobody (58:48 - 58:53)
uses websites anymore (58:50 - 58:54)
so it's like why would you put your (58:53 - 58:56)
energy behind that i mean people could (58:54 - 58:57)
just not listen to the show and just go (58:56 - 58:59)
to pokemon.com and get all their news (58:57 - 59:02)
but nobody but they don't they come to (58:59 - 59:05)
us a week later i mean i would argue we (59:02 - 59:06)
are more entertaining than reading those (59:05 - 59:08)
dry press releases but i would argue the (59:06 - 59:10)
opposite (59:08 - 59:13)
[Laughter] (59:10 - 59:13)
i (59:15 - 59:18)
mean (59:16 - 59:19)
i would assume that they're not done (59:18 - 59:22)
showing pokemon it's only (59:19 - 59:25)
october and we have still some months to (59:22 - 59:26)
go (59:25 - 59:28)
some months we have (59:26 - 59:33)
a month to go (59:28 - 59:33)
good part of january (59:34 - 59:37)
yeah i i it seems exciting i think the (59:42 - 59:46)
zoroark thing is cool (59:44 - 59:49)
so the zuru looks cool as our arc looks (59:46 - 59:50)
cool (59:49 - 59:53)
the little teaser trailer was fine it's (59:50 - 59:56)
i'm sure some people had fun with it (59:53 - 59:57)
oh yeah i mean i had a lot of people who (59:56 - 59:59)
were like oh did you see the times the (59:57 - 60:01)
times gave it away and i'm like (59:59 - 60:03)
yeah because it was like okay (60:01 - 60:07)
it's 706. no wait it's 707. and the only (60:03 - 60:09)
two that you know whatever (60:07 - 60:11)
that led to zero (60:09 - 60:13)
so uh we were like ah we figured out i'm (60:11 - 60:15)
like congrats i didn't pay that much (60:13 - 60:17)
attention i was focused on the poor dude (60:15 - 60:20)
that died did they detective (60:17 - 60:22)
quiz clue from will anderson where he (60:20 - 60:24)
puts the number right in front of you (60:22 - 60:25)
and then (60:24 - 60:26)
choose to ignore it (60:25 - 60:28)
i wrote that actually (60:26 - 60:31)
it was actually will's uh (60:28 - 60:33)
one minute youtube video that they just (60:31 - 60:34)
stole (60:33 - 60:36)
well no i just i wrote the script (60:34 - 60:38)
got it (60:36 - 60:38)
uh yeah i'm like i'm excited i'm glad (60:39 - 60:46)
they're still showing new pokemon (60:43 - 60:49)
we'll we'll see when it uh (60:46 - 60:51)
uh i'm sure we'll get something with the (60:49 - 60:53)
lead up to diamond pearl i'm sure (60:51 - 60:54)
there'll be like one more final trailer (60:53 - 60:56)
for diamond and pearl (60:54 - 60:57)
i (60:56 - 60:59)
don't know if there's any other hidden (60:57 - 61:00)
secrets for diamond and pearl i think (60:59 - 61:02)
they've shown all their cards for that (61:00 - 61:05)
game at this point (61:02 - 61:05)
so (61:05 - 61:09)
yeah i don't i don't know what else (61:07 - 61:11)
they can really (61:09 - 61:13)
do (61:11 - 61:14)
the only other thing that i'd want to (61:13 - 61:17)
hear about diamond and pearl since (61:14 - 61:19)
they haven't announced doing a platinum (61:17 - 61:21)
is are they going to include platinum (61:19 - 61:23)
content (61:21 - 61:25)
in diamond and pearl or (61:23 - 61:27)
are they just going to leave them as (61:25 - 61:28)
they were (61:27 - 61:30)
well i think that was already speculated (61:28 - 61:32)
that it is platinum content because (61:30 - 61:34)
they've (61:32 - 61:36)
um early trailers showed like (61:34 - 61:38)
one or two npcs that were like oh these (61:36 - 61:40)
npcs were only in platinum okay we see (61:38 - 61:42)
them in this trailer it's i mean it (61:40 - 61:46)
seems to be a hybrid like i (61:42 - 61:48)
i i think they're probably gonna steal (61:46 - 61:51)
parts to make like (61:48 - 61:52)
but it's not going to be exactly (61:51 - 61:55)
platinum (61:52 - 61:55)
is it going to be a faithful remake in (61:56 - 62:01)
the sense of they're not going to also (61:58 - 62:03)
include a shiny charm this game i i find (62:01 - 62:05)
it hard to believe that they (62:03 - 62:07)
i mean can we not just throw the (62:05 - 62:09)
faithful out the window as people (62:07 - 62:10)
interpret that (62:09 - 62:11)
there's nothing (62:10 - 62:14)
quote unquote faithful as people were (62:11 - 62:16)
saying it was i think it's just the (62:14 - 62:18)
story yeah yeah it's just faithful to (62:16 - 62:20)
the story (62:18 - 62:23)
not a line-by-line remake with no (62:20 - 62:25)
changes has (62:23 - 62:27)
people flipped it on twitter (62:25 - 62:30)
copy and paste copy and paste ctrl c (62:27 - 62:33)
ctrl v baby speaking of shiny charm uh (62:30 - 62:34)
in case you didn't know the shiny charm (62:33 - 62:38)
was introduced in black to white too (62:34 - 62:41)
that long not black and white (62:38 - 62:44)
and in order to get the shiny charm you (62:41 - 62:45)
would had to complete your entire (62:44 - 62:46)
pokedex (62:45 - 62:50)
which would have required at least (62:46 - 62:50)
diamond pearl platinum (62:51 - 62:55)
you could maybe skip platinum uh (62:53 - 62:57)
definitely heart gold soul silver and i (62:55 - 62:59)
think (62:57 - 63:00)
i think you would still need ruby and (62:59 - 63:03)
sapphire and fire red leaf green there (63:00 - 63:05)
was a chart at one point in time that (63:03 - 63:07)
showed yeah you would have to like all (63:05 - 63:08)
the games you would need to get (63:07 - 63:11)
everything um so in in black 2 white 2 (63:08 - 63:14)
the odds were still at 1 8 000 (63:11 - 63:16)
but it was the first game to get the (63:14 - 63:18)
shiny charm so then your odds would be (63:16 - 63:19)
three and eight thousand which i think (63:18 - 63:22)
brings it down to one in two thousand (63:19 - 63:24)
six hundred if i can do math in my head (63:22 - 63:25)
correctly (63:24 - 63:29)
uh which is pretty good uh for (63:25 - 63:31)
for that game (63:29 - 63:32)
uh (63:31 - 63:34)
i mean if you were hunting in diamond (63:32 - 63:35)
pearl it was one in eight thousand and (63:34 - 63:37)
so one two thousand six hundred and one (63:35 - 63:39)
in eight thousand normal odd game is (63:37 - 63:41)
pretty good and then in x and y they (63:39 - 63:45)
changed it to one in four 000 (63:41 - 63:46)
uh with the shiny charm still being in (63:45 - 63:48)
that game (63:46 - 63:51)
although you could argue (63:48 - 63:53)
that boy getting the shiny charm in x (63:51 - 63:55)
and y and omega ruby alpha sapphire is (63:53 - 63:57)
an absolute nightmare (63:55 - 63:58)
uh (63:57 - 63:59)
because they require all the pokemon for (63:58 - 64:02)
those games too which was up to (63:59 - 64:04)
what was it 682 pokemon or something (64:02 - 64:07)
like that yeah did (64:04 - 64:09)
pokemon (64:07 - 64:12)
what was it it wasn't home (64:09 - 64:14)
what was before bank pokemon bank was (64:12 - 64:17)
that available for x and y or not yet (64:14 - 64:20)
it was not available at launch so yeah (64:17 - 64:22)
xmi i believe came out in october that (64:20 - 64:25)
was a lot of work yeah and pokemon bank (64:22 - 64:27)
came out at the end of the year because (64:25 - 64:29)
that was the (64:27 - 64:32)
forever waiting meme (64:29 - 64:34)
for that because it was pokemon bank was (64:32 - 64:37)
delayed yep (64:34 - 64:37)
so we don't know what the shiny odds are (64:38 - 64:42)
for diamond pearl we don't know if the (64:40 - 64:44)
starters are shiny locked they were (64:42 - 64:45)
locked in let's go pikachu let's go (64:44 - 64:46)
eevee they were locked in sword and (64:45 - 64:50)
shield uh (64:46 - 64:50)
are they gonna go three for three and (64:50 - 64:55)
just lock him lock the starters here (64:52 - 64:57)
probably (64:55 - 65:01)
i don't think it's a coincidence that (64:57 - 65:05)
x and y had a pretty long intro and then (65:01 - 65:07)
they did an even longer intro for sun (65:05 - 65:11)
and moon oh yeah they did uh (65:07 - 65:11)
i for some reason they don't want people (65:12 - 65:15)
to (65:14 - 65:18)
spend 40 or in this case 60 on the game (65:15 - 65:20)
and then turn it on and off over and (65:18 - 65:21)
over (65:20 - 65:22)
hey that's your money if you want to do (65:21 - 65:25)
that cool but (65:22 - 65:26)
clearly they don't want us to do that (65:25 - 65:29)
i mean they're gonna make it as painful (65:26 - 65:31)
as possible (65:29 - 65:33)
i will say though that uh speaking of (65:31 - 65:36)
shiny stuff i did do that youtube video (65:33 - 65:38)
it will be (65:36 - 65:40)
if you just go to youtube.com pkmencast (65:38 - 65:41)
i explain (65:40 - 65:42)
how (65:41 - 65:45)
shiny hunting actually works in sword (65:42 - 65:48)
and shield for two years (65:45 - 65:50)
streaming this game this game on twitch (65:48 - 65:52)
and people being like man i hate shiny (65:50 - 65:54)
hunting and sword and shield it's broken (65:52 - 65:56)
game freak mess it's not broken (65:54 - 65:58)
it works spoiler serubi was wrong for (65:56 - 66:01)
two years as of this recording i went to (65:58 - 66:03)
syraby's website they still have the (66:01 - 66:03)
wrong (66:03 - 66:06)
data on their website and how shiny (66:03 - 66:10)
hunting works i don't think joe cares no (66:06 - 66:10)
uh i don't think he's gonna update it i (66:11 - 66:16)
know the what is it sos is still wrong (66:13 - 66:19)
on cerebe as well (66:16 - 66:22)
it's whatever there's a certain the (66:19 - 66:25)
pokey radar i think is also wrong on (66:22 - 66:26)
cereby (66:25 - 66:28)
joe is not a big shiny hunter and when (66:26 - 66:30)
joe closes something (66:28 - 66:32)
it's closed it's closed he doesn't want (66:30 - 66:34)
to go back to it nah i don't know he (66:32 - 66:38)
will not take other people's he he like (66:34 - 66:40)
he will look at other people's data but (66:38 - 66:41)
until he (66:40 - 66:42)
does it (66:41 - 66:44)
he's not going to update the website (66:42 - 66:45)
right so he would have to look at this (66:44 - 66:48)
new data and then do it so i i'm telling (66:45 - 66:50)
you as of this record this podcast (66:48 - 66:53)
recording sarah b is wrong on the shiny (66:50 - 66:55)
odds in sword and shield and how it (66:53 - 66:57)
works it is not broken i did an 18 (66:55 - 66:59)
minute youtube video on how it works (66:57 - 67:02)
with the hard data to back it up from a (66:59 - 67:05)
twitter user named anubis she (67:02 - 67:07)
has done a lot of work (67:05 - 67:09)
in breaking down how things work in (67:07 - 67:10)
sword and shield she's done this for (67:09 - 67:13)
cynicity she's done this for mark (67:10 - 67:14)
hunting she's done this for chain (67:13 - 67:17)
fishing she did it for like and she has (67:14 - 67:19)
all the data to back up how it is for (67:17 - 67:21)
curry hunting as well and how it (67:19 - 67:23)
actually works (67:21 - 67:25)
whereas if you go to cerebe and you go (67:23 - 67:27)
to the shiny odds page it just gives you (67:25 - 67:29)
information with no source no date on (67:27 - 67:32)
how it works it's just here it is (67:29 - 67:32)
um (67:32 - 67:35)
so there is proof behind this (67:32 - 67:38)
the too long didn't read is brilliant (67:35 - 67:41)
pokemon have an increased shiny chance (67:38 - 67:43)
in sword and shield so (67:41 - 67:45)
knocking out (67:43 - 67:47)
pokemon increases the chance for (67:45 - 67:49)
brilliant knocking out more pokemon (67:47 - 67:52)
increases the chance of shiny (67:49 - 67:54)
those two together (67:52 - 67:56)
increases your chance of finding a shiny (67:54 - 67:57)
pokemon (67:56 - 67:59)
my youtube video explains that if you (67:57 - 68:00)
want to look at it and if you did look (67:59 - 68:02)
at it thank you for spending 18 minutes (68:00 - 68:05)
of how that actually works (68:02 - 68:05)
um and i think that's it i think that's (68:06 - 68:09)
our show so (68:08 - 68:11)
greg (68:09 - 68:13)
give us our questions yes (68:11 - 68:16)
all right (68:13 - 68:16)
let's do the question of the week (68:16 - 68:22)
um (68:21 - 68:24)
i'd say that's appropriate for the time (68:22 - 68:26)
of the year (68:24 - 68:26)
also steve has no idea what that is i (68:27 - 68:32)
don't miles thank you for sending in the (68:30 - 68:34)
zamasunta stuff (68:32 - 68:37)
inferno sending in the (68:34 - 68:41)
bad footage trailer stuff (68:37 - 68:43)
where that guy totally dies (68:41 - 68:46)
um (68:43 - 68:46)
we have (68:46 - 68:49)
this is from nat (68:51 - 68:55)
my calendar is reminding me to renew my (68:53 - 68:57)
pokemon bank membership how long do we (68:55 - 69:00)
think nintendo will keep pokemon bank (68:57 - 69:02)
alive (69:00 - 69:06)
i say we got another two years isn't it (69:02 - 69:06)
i mean how when did they shut off online (69:07 - 69:13)
services for black and white (69:10 - 69:16)
because it took a long time it wasn't (69:13 - 69:18)
game freak that shut it down it was (69:16 - 69:20)
the (69:18 - 69:21)
nintendo that shut it down because they (69:20 - 69:22)
shut down all (69:21 - 69:23)
yeah (69:22 - 69:26)
all things at once yeah but they they (69:23 - 69:28)
have a tendency to keep online services (69:26 - 69:30)
for the games for a certain period of (69:28 - 69:32)
time and then (69:30 - 69:34)
so whatever that timeline is that would (69:32 - 69:35)
probably be the equivalent for pokemon (69:34 - 69:38)
bank i would say we have at least at (69:35 - 69:40)
least two more years of it like they're (69:38 - 69:41)
gonna get as much money out of that (69:40 - 69:43)
before they're like shut down all 3ds (69:41 - 69:46)
everything (69:43 - 69:48)
um well (69:46 - 69:51)
do you so i i guess so 3ds online is (69:48 - 69:53)
free (69:51 - 69:56)
if that completely shut down (69:53 - 69:59)
would bank still work (69:56 - 69:59)
uh yeah it's a separate (69:59 - 70:03)
right it's a separate thing yeah but how (70:01 - 70:06)
would you access it (70:03 - 70:06)
i mean even if they shut down (70:07 - 70:12)
no your 3ds would connect directly to (70:10 - 70:13)
the internet and then it would go to (70:12 - 70:16)
whatever service for the app that it was (70:13 - 70:17)
being used on the 3d it didn't have to (70:16 - 70:21)
go through like 3ds online to then get (70:17 - 70:23)
to pokemon bank (70:21 - 70:26)
um (70:23 - 70:26)
but (70:26 - 70:31)
my my guess would be like (70:27 - 70:33)
they they still know people play old (70:31 - 70:35)
pokemon games right you could take a (70:33 - 70:36)
pokemon (70:35 - 70:40)
from coliseum move it into fire red leaf (70:36 - 70:41)
green move it into heart gold soul (70:40 - 70:43)
silver move it to black and white throw (70:41 - 70:46)
it through bank (70:43 - 70:49)
into directly from bank either into x (70:46 - 70:51)
and y or sun and moon or directly into (70:49 - 70:54)
home from there (70:51 - 70:54)
so that there (70:55 - 71:00)
there's the physical connection and the (70:58 - 71:02)
hardware connection you need (71:00 - 71:05)
for the first part of the games which is (71:02 - 71:07)
on you to own or get (71:05 - 71:08)
but (71:07 - 71:10)
if if they (71:08 - 71:13)
shut down bank they're they're actually (71:10 - 71:16)
cutting off a bridge (71:13 - 71:18)
between four games (71:16 - 71:18)
four (71:18 - 71:20)
more than four (71:18 - 71:22)
between like seven games to the newer (71:20 - 71:24)
stuff (71:22 - 71:27)
i would have assumed that bank was going (71:24 - 71:29)
to last for a year it's been over a year (71:27 - 71:30)
now and they were just going to come up (71:29 - 71:32)
with a qr code system (71:30 - 71:34)
that would be like (71:32 - 71:36)
you move these into bank (71:34 - 71:39)
bank generates you a qr code (71:36 - 71:41)
you scan that with your phone (71:39 - 71:45)
that sends it to your home account (71:41 - 71:45)
and then they (71:47 - 71:51)
they those pokemon disappear from bank (71:48 - 71:55)
and that that that lasts forever i don't (71:51 - 71:58)
know i i don't think so (71:55 - 71:58)
because i cut things off before (71:58 - 72:02)
i can't see them cutting things off and (72:03 - 72:06)
then just cutting that bridge down (72:05 - 72:09)
completely though without a solution (72:06 - 72:13)
well no the solution is like (72:09 - 72:16)
if all of the pokemon are available in a (72:13 - 72:17)
game (72:16 - 72:20)
that can be moved forward (72:17 - 72:21)
through some method (72:20 - 72:24)
then whatever old games also had that (72:21 - 72:27)
pokemon no longer matter they don't care (72:24 - 72:30)
about you having your pokemon from (72:27 - 72:32)
original pearl they just care that you (72:30 - 72:35)
can get that particular pokemon in a (72:32 - 72:38)
relevant game right now (72:35 - 72:38)
i mean i agree that they probably don't (72:41 - 72:45)
care (72:43 - 72:45)
there are probably a handful of people (72:45 - 72:51)
at game freak that do care there's (72:48 - 72:52)
probably the other handful of game freak (72:51 - 72:54)
that are like (72:52 - 72:56)
this is too complicated and not worth it (72:54 - 72:57)
for yeah (72:56 - 73:00)
the overhead the cost overhead (72:57 - 73:02)
just outweighs the actual benefit of the (73:00 - 73:05)
company (73:02 - 73:05)
i don't get why bank and home are just (73:06 - 73:11)
not one membership (73:08 - 73:12)
agree (73:11 - 73:14)
oh yeah i don't (73:12 - 73:17)
i mean because they can double dip (73:14 - 73:19)
and people will pay the double dip costs (73:17 - 73:21)
like why are you still paying for help (73:19 - 73:23)
move your stuff into bank and just pay (73:21 - 73:26)
for bank and be done with it (73:23 - 73:28)
yeah i mean like i i think of that too (73:26 - 73:30)
like i have i have (73:28 - 73:35)
probably a dozen shiny pokemon in pre (73:30 - 73:35)
x and y games (73:36 - 73:41)
so they have to go through bank (73:38 - 73:43)
and i have probably a hundred plus (73:41 - 73:45)
pokemon between (73:43 - 73:47)
x and y (73:45 - 73:48)
and sun and moon games (73:47 - 73:50)
that are still there (73:48 - 73:53)
because my thought process because i'm (73:50 - 73:55)
absolutely insane is i want to get (73:53 - 73:57)
ribbons on these pokemon (73:55 - 73:59)
in those older games because before i (73:57 - 74:02)
move them up (73:59 - 74:02)
and i don't want to move them because i (74:02 - 74:06)
haven't done the work to get those (74:04 - 74:08)
ribbons on them (74:06 - 74:11)
so they're stuck here until i do that (74:08 - 74:13)
but even if i'm to the point where it's (74:11 - 74:15)
like okay i have 50 shiny pokemon (74:13 - 74:18)
ultrasound ultramoon i got the battle (74:15 - 74:20)
ribbon on them i got the footprint (74:18 - 74:21)
ribbon on them i got the battle tree (74:20 - 74:24)
ribbon on them they're ready to move (74:21 - 74:28)
there's still a point where in (74:24 - 74:30)
one or two or three or four years that (74:28 - 74:31)
i'll be like you know what (74:30 - 74:35)
let's play ultrasound ultra moon (74:31 - 74:35)
oh bank doesn't exist anymore how do i (74:36 - 74:40)
get this pokemon out of here yes (74:38 - 74:42)
it's called you waited too long yeah i'm (74:40 - 74:44)
sorry sir (74:42 - 74:45)
well look we know that they're going to (74:44 - 74:48)
remake sun and moon one day they're (74:45 - 74:50)
going to remake every game oh yeah so (74:48 - 74:52)
sun and moon is the game you got to go (74:50 - 74:53)
back to to get your nostalgia because (74:52 - 74:55)
it's the longest period before they (74:53 - 74:57)
remake it (74:55 - 74:58)
no (74:57 - 75:00)
like i might not need to go back to (74:58 - 75:02)
diamond and pearl because we're getting (75:00 - 75:05)
that fix in a month (75:02 - 75:07)
and then when that comes out we just (75:05 - 75:09)
think like oh well black and white remix (75:07 - 75:11)
are around the corner than the next one (75:09 - 75:15)
in line that's so exciting (75:11 - 75:17)
um (75:15 - 75:18)
teams ekrom (75:17 - 75:22)
[Laughter] (75:18 - 75:24)
i don't think they cut it off without (75:22 - 75:27)
providing a new solution (75:24 - 75:30)
i think they will warn everybody (75:27 - 75:32)
you have one year (75:30 - 75:34)
to move your stuff into home because (75:32 - 75:36)
we're shutting down bank and then shut (75:34 - 75:38)
it off (75:36 - 75:39)
i mean they did shut down the dream (75:38 - 75:42)
world yep just shut it off (75:39 - 75:45)
it's done (75:42 - 75:45)
what if i want to get pokemon and dream (75:46 - 75:49)
balls i can't (75:48 - 75:52)
provide the solution it's called pokemon (75:49 - 75:53)
home you can move everything from bank (75:52 - 75:56)
into home the solution is there they (75:53 - 75:58)
don't need to provide another solution (75:56 - 76:00)
they will say it's shutting down in a (75:58 - 76:01)
year (76:00 - 76:03)
move it or lose it and if you don't move (76:01 - 76:05)
it (76:03 - 76:06)
it's done (76:05 - 76:07)
you know (76:06 - 76:10)
another part of me is like well the the (76:07 - 76:12)
the collector and the (76:10 - 76:13)
the (76:12 - 76:15)
me having the al so here's the thing i (76:13 - 76:17)
have all the old games i have all the (76:15 - 76:19)
hardware to play the old games i have (76:17 - 76:21)
the gamecube i have the link cables i (76:19 - 76:23)
have the gamecube to gameboy advanced (76:21 - 76:27)
link cables i got three ds lights i got (76:23 - 76:29)
four 3d i have all the hardware i am the (76:27 - 76:32)
person who can trade with myself because (76:29 - 76:35)
i have four copies of the game as well (76:32 - 76:38)
so in that situation i'm thinking (76:35 - 76:40)
i don't want it never to not work (76:38 - 76:42)
because i have everything that makes it (76:40 - 76:43)
work (76:42 - 76:45)
but i'm also (76:43 - 76:47)
now realizing that there are plenty of (76:45 - 76:49)
pokemon fans out there (76:47 - 76:50)
that (76:49 - 76:51)
they don't have a copy of heart gold (76:50 - 76:53)
soul silver they don't have a ds light (76:51 - 76:55)
they don't have a nintendo gamecube they (76:53 - 76:57)
don't ha even if they did have a (76:55 - 76:58)
nintendo ds light they don't have two (76:57 - 77:01)
nintendo ds lights (76:58 - 77:03)
and (77:01 - 77:06)
retro games are are so (77:03 - 77:08)
frustrating to find and collect (77:06 - 77:11)
at this point that it's kind of almost (77:08 - 77:14)
better to be like this whole system is (77:11 - 77:14)
bad (77:14 - 77:17)
and we can't fix it and it's not going (77:14 - 77:18)
to get any better right there's not (77:17 - 77:20)
going to be some sudden flux of ds (77:18 - 77:23)
lights or gamecubes or or (77:20 - 77:24)
link cables that are just going to (77:23 - 77:27)
suddenly appear it's all bad (77:24 - 77:29)
um (77:27 - 77:33)
and so if the solution is (77:29 - 77:33)
putting red and blue back on the eshop (77:33 - 77:37)
or putting gold and silver on the eshop (77:35 - 77:38)
or putting (77:37 - 77:40)
diamond and pearl remakes on the eshop (77:38 - 77:43)
where you can just instead of trying to (77:40 - 77:45)
find old hardware (77:43 - 77:47)
and trying to find old cartridges (77:45 - 77:48)
you can just go and spend the money and (77:47 - 77:51)
do it the problem with that though is (77:48 - 77:53)
some people like the old stuff i get (77:51 - 77:56)
that but also (77:53 - 77:59)
they as a com well they as the pokemon (77:56 - 78:01)
company but also they as nintendo are (77:59 - 78:04)
still really bad at just giving people (78:01 - 78:09)
an easy solution to play those old games (78:04 - 78:09)
like why (78:09 - 78:14)
did the wii u and the wii have more (78:11 - 78:16)
retro games on it than the nintendo (78:14 - 78:19)
switch that has been out for five years (78:16 - 78:21)
i don't know the nintendo switch has the (78:19 - 78:24)
the nes and super nes emulators i (78:21 - 78:29)
waiting for the n64 emulator but yeah (78:24 - 78:29)
yeah but those but the swi the wii and (78:29 - 78:34)
the wii u had way more to pick from like (78:31 - 78:36)
it's been like the wii had sin and (78:34 - 78:38)
punishment it's been five years and the (78:36 - 78:39)
switch is finally getting sin and (78:38 - 78:41)
punishment you got to panic for 30 (78:39 - 78:42)
dollars (78:41 - 78:44)
it was just an example (78:42 - 78:46)
what is this game why is this an example (78:44 - 78:49)
is this your favorite game no it's just (78:46 - 78:51)
it was a japanese nintendo first party (78:49 - 78:52)
game that never came to the united (78:51 - 78:54)
states and then they released it on the (78:52 - 78:57)
wii u for the wii for the first time (78:54 - 78:59)
and people made a big deal about it (78:57 - 79:01)
and so it was on the wii (78:59 - 79:04)
for over 10 years (79:01 - 79:06)
and it's the switch has been out for (79:04 - 79:08)
five years and now they're finally (79:06 - 79:10)
adding it i mean because nobody wants it (79:08 - 79:12)
because nobody wants it okay this was (79:10 - 79:13)
just the example of the game the point (79:12 - 79:14)
is (79:13 - 79:16)
the switch has been out for five years (79:14 - 79:18)
yeah it doesn't have all of these games (79:16 - 79:20)
that have existed on the wii for 10 plus (79:18 - 79:21)
years they're just double games it's (79:20 - 79:23)
just like (79:21 - 79:25)
the coding the hardware (79:23 - 79:28)
is a little different with upscaling so (79:25 - 79:29)
they're it's not like they could just (79:28 - 79:31)
say shove it in there i know (79:29 - 79:33)
they they would have to find resources (79:31 - 79:35)
and people willing to do it and there (79:33 - 79:37)
may not be people willing to do that (79:35 - 79:39)
work they're like no who wants this (79:37 - 79:41)
weird sin and punishment game it didn't (79:39 - 79:43)
sell well on the wii (79:41 - 79:45)
why would we put it on and then finally (79:43 - 79:46)
somebody said it's my favorite game you (79:45 - 79:49)
are getting up on the fact of sin and (79:46 - 79:51)
punishment literally use any other video (79:49 - 79:53)
game in existence the switch has been (79:51 - 79:55)
out for five years the game offering (79:53 - 79:58)
that they have is pi i am just using it (79:55 - 80:00)
as an example my example applies to all (79:58 - 80:02)
the other games i'm just using cinder (80:00 - 80:03)
punishment because a lot of people on (80:02 - 80:05)
this podcast brought it up it could be (80:03 - 80:08)
any game the same things apply so you're (80:05 - 80:11)
getting hung up on me using your example (80:08 - 80:13)
it could be any example and i'm just (80:11 - 80:15)
using the one that you brought up as an (80:13 - 80:17)
example off of your example why would (80:15 - 80:19)
you sit (80:17 - 80:19)
why would they spend (80:22 - 80:25)
resources (80:24 - 80:27)
getting old games to work on the switch (80:25 - 80:29)
when they could spend those resources (80:27 - 80:32)
making new good games (80:29 - 80:34)
i agree (80:32 - 80:37)
i'm not disagreeing (80:34 - 80:38)
i am saying it sounds like you're just (80:37 - 80:41)
sounds like you're disagreeing (80:38 - 80:43)
the agreement says yes let's move on to (80:41 - 80:45)
the next question they put (80:43 - 80:48)
mystery dungeon explorers of the sky on (80:45 - 80:50)
the wii u (80:48 - 80:55)
not on switch okay it was on the wii u (80:50 - 80:55)
i think this goes into a deeper (80:58 - 81:01)
conversation of people (80:59 - 81:05)
emulating or just finding a way to play (81:01 - 81:08)
old games (81:05 - 81:10)
because nintendo doesn't do a good job (81:08 - 81:12)
of giving people the ability to play (81:10 - 81:14)
this is such a (81:12 - 81:17)
minority of hobbyists (81:14 - 81:20)
that it's just not they're gonna put in (81:17 - 81:21)
the effort to do it and they're gonna (81:20 - 81:23)
download an emulator on their computer (81:21 - 81:25)
and get the roms illegally one way or (81:23 - 81:27)
the other i mean this relies on people (81:25 - 81:30)
deciding not to get paid to make roms (81:27 - 81:31)
and emulators (81:30 - 81:34)
like they usually rely on donations so (81:31 - 81:36)
if you can find somebody who will work (81:34 - 81:38)
for free to emulate on the switch i'm (81:36 - 81:39)
sure nintendo would be thrilled to have (81:38 - 81:42)
you (81:39 - 81:44)
if you want to say yeah i love this game (81:42 - 81:47)
so much i will fix all the problems (81:44 - 81:48)
for free (81:47 - 81:51)
okay as a pokemon fan though (81:48 - 81:53)
let's bring it back to pokemon okay if (81:51 - 81:54)
you wanted to play heart gold soul (81:53 - 81:57)
silver which i don't (81:54 - 81:59)
but if you did yeah (81:57 - 82:02)
you got to find a retro game shop (81:59 - 82:04)
and they're going to be selling it you (82:02 - 82:06)
got to hope that it's real (82:04 - 82:07)
ideally it fits them on paw shop it (82:06 - 82:09)
probably is real because they usually (82:07 - 82:10)
normally check (82:09 - 82:14)
but then you have to pay like at minimum (82:10 - 82:15)
just as as this recording prices could (82:14 - 82:17)
go up and down (82:15 - 82:19)
probably a hundred bucks (82:17 - 82:22)
okay but heart gold soul silver (82:19 - 82:22)
and knowing that like oh heart gold soul (82:24 - 82:28)
silver might not have compatibility in (82:26 - 82:32)
the future if they cut off this bank (82:28 - 82:34)
or (82:32 - 82:34)
they could (82:35 - 82:38)
nintendo slash the pokemon company could (82:36 - 82:41)
put it on an e-shop (82:38 - 82:45)
and make 40 bucks pretty easily (82:41 - 82:46)
or the other option is people get (82:45 - 82:48)
frustrated that they (82:46 - 82:50)
don't have the hardware or they can't (82:48 - 82:52)
find it or when they do find it it's 100 (82:50 - 82:53)
bucks so then they just go emulate it (82:52 - 82:56)
instead i'm sure that they have done the (82:53 - 82:58)
market research to do the cost (82:56 - 83:01)
comparison of what if we e-shopped this (82:58 - 83:04)
versus if we do nothing for the number (83:01 - 83:06)
of hobbyists who actually care about (83:04 - 83:08)
playing this very old (83:06 - 83:09)
15-year (83:08 - 83:11)
old whatever maybe not eleven-year-old (83:09 - 83:13)
game i'm sure they did too actually the (83:11 - 83:15)
assumption that they're never going to (83:13 - 83:18)
remake these games in the upper hardware (83:15 - 83:19)
is a bold like (83:18 - 83:21)
they may not want to bring the old ones (83:19 - 83:22)
up because they're planning on making a (83:21 - 83:24)
new version of it (83:22 - 83:26)
from the 30th anniversary wait for the (83:24 - 83:28)
swoosh to come out and the swish comes (83:26 - 83:30)
out (83:28 - 83:30)
i love the swoosh (83:31 - 83:35)
but i mean even for those games it's (83:33 - 83:36)
still uh it still applies they have to (83:35 - 83:39)
update it to play on this (83:36 - 83:41)
yeah yeah they said it's hard to work (83:39 - 83:43)
yeah they started the work (83:41 - 83:45)
that doesn't come for free (83:43 - 83:47)
emulators often have people doing free (83:45 - 83:50)
labor to get these out illegally (83:47 - 83:51)
so there was a (83:50 - 83:54)
an article for (83:51 - 83:56)
back when xbox live came out and they (83:54 - 83:59)
were doing old games (83:56 - 84:01)
and it actually it pretty much stated (83:59 - 84:03)
that (84:01 - 84:05)
these retro games are not nearly as (84:03 - 84:07)
popular as people think they are yeah (84:05 - 84:08)
like you'll you'll hear like you know (84:07 - 84:10)
you'll go on twitter or read it and (84:08 - 84:11)
somebody will be like oh my gosh sin and (84:10 - 84:13)
punishment is coming back and like it (84:11 - 84:14)
gets upvoted and you're like wow the (84:13 - 84:15)
people really like the sin and (84:14 - 84:17)
punishment game but then you have to (84:15 - 84:19)
think like (84:17 - 84:20)
oh that's not a lot of people it's not a (84:19 - 84:23)
lot of people yeah (84:20 - 84:26)
it's the same thing like (84:23 - 84:28)
there's a i would love i would love and (84:26 - 84:31)
there are websites dedicated to the (84:28 - 84:33)
shining force games and shining force 3 (84:31 - 84:35)
never came to america not all three (84:33 - 84:38)
parts i would love (84:35 - 84:41)
for them to come (84:38 - 84:42)
and there if you look on the internet (84:41 - 84:44)
there's a lot of people who think like (84:42 - 84:46)
me but that's like (84:44 - 84:48)
a thousand people oh (84:46 - 84:49)
i (84:48 - 84:53)
was nothing super fan of the legacy of (84:49 - 84:55)
kane series (84:53 - 84:57)
playstation and (84:55 - 84:59)
i'm never going to see those games ever (84:57 - 85:01)
again (84:59 - 85:02)
nah (85:01 - 85:04)
they're the sin and punishment of they (85:02 - 85:07)
must be that's such a good such a good (85:04 - 85:08)
story (85:07 - 85:12)
good story to play (85:08 - 85:16)
soul reaver you could say oh i'm sorry (85:12 - 85:18)
right (85:16 - 85:18)
let me pull up our youtube question here (85:20 - 85:25)
real quick (85:22 - 85:25)
what do we have (85:27 - 85:31)
oh i don't think i wait here we go (85:32 - 85:35)
uh this is from fudge fox (85:36 - 85:40)
uh my question of the week is for (85:38 - 85:42)
brilliant diamond and shining pearl what (85:40 - 85:44)
if they introduced two new eevee (85:42 - 85:45)
evolutions what would you want them to (85:44 - 85:48)
be and why i they say they would run a (85:45 - 85:51)
flying eevee and a dragon ev um i think (85:48 - 85:53)
it's safe to say that (85:51 - 85:54)
these games are not getting new evs no i (85:53 - 85:56)
don't think so but we can still (85:54 - 85:59)
speculate (85:56 - 85:59)
i was just going to jump do quick that (86:00 - 86:04)
since the last new eevee was fairy type (86:01 - 86:06)
that the two new evs would have to be (86:04 - 86:09)
poison and steel (86:06 - 86:09)
i would want (86:10 - 86:13)
i know i want one to be ghost (86:14 - 86:19)
what would i want the other one to be (86:17 - 86:21)
but to see it's like how do you turn how (86:19 - 86:23)
do you get your eevee to evolve into (86:21 - 86:25)
these things like for the poison type eb (86:23 - 86:28)
feed your eevee poison for the ghost (86:25 - 86:31)
type eevee i have to go in there (86:28 - 86:35)
have your evie knocked out 15 times (86:31 - 86:37)
uh (86:35 - 86:40)
hmm i know i want ghost (86:37 - 86:42)
i would want a flying eevee if it was (86:40 - 86:44)
only pure flying yeah yeah and i'd be (86:42 - 86:46)
super into that (86:44 - 86:48)
well (86:46 - 86:52)
right now is tornadoes yes correct (86:48 - 86:54)
although a dual type eevee would be (86:52 - 86:55)
interesting (86:54 - 86:57)
i would i could i could get behind a (86:55 - 87:00)
ground type ev2 (86:57 - 87:02)
ghost and ground are my choices what's (87:00 - 87:04)
going to happen is (87:02 - 87:07)
in a future generation when we're too (87:04 - 87:09)
old to be reporting on pokemon news any (87:07 - 87:12)
longer they're going to introduce (87:09 - 87:16)
a third eevee evolution that is the dual (87:12 - 87:19)
types oh no (87:16 - 87:21)
it's just a trivia fusion the first (87:19 - 87:23)
triple type no triple types no triple (87:21 - 87:25)
types no we'll get there one day no (87:23 - 87:27)
they're gonna do it (87:25 - 87:29)
no (87:27 - 87:30)
um (87:29 - 87:32)
i would say flying ground yeah you got (87:30 - 87:34)
one in this guy one on the ground pure (87:32 - 87:36)
flying that would be great we i think (87:34 - 87:37)
tornadoes (87:36 - 87:40)
is the only pure flying at this point (87:37 - 87:41)
um (87:40 - 87:43)
there's a probably a couple pure ground (87:41 - 87:45)
i think silicobra is pure ground (87:43 - 87:49)
um i think mudsdale is pure ground (87:45 - 87:49)
but yeah ground is all right (87:49 - 87:52)
will pokemon of the week all right well (87:56 - 88:01)
last week's pokemon uh was a mistake so (87:58 - 88:03)
i'm sure everybody got it right because (88:01 - 88:05)
it's real easy with all the information (88:03 - 88:07)
that i gave you but (88:05 - 88:11)
uh it's one from two months ago (88:07 - 88:13)
and uh i mean it was one sentence this (88:11 - 88:15)
recently featured repeat from two months (88:13 - 88:17)
ago pokemon which steve thinks is so (88:15 - 88:19)
powerful that it warped the rules of a (88:17 - 88:21)
competition also falls in line with the (88:19 - 88:23)
trends started to pokemon ago there you (88:21 - 88:28)
go that's your clue what is it so easy (88:23 - 88:28)
[Music] (88:29 - 88:33)
oh my night (88:30 - 88:33)
it's (88:36 - 88:38)
chat (88:36 - 88:40)
what is wrong with you guys (88:38 - 88:44)
it's munchlax no (88:40 - 88:46)
i thought it was munchlax i started (88:44 - 88:48)
typing that into google (88:46 - 88:50)
don't even type it into google (88:48 - 88:53)
no (88:50 - 88:53)
it has to be a middle evolution (88:53 - 88:57)
it's (88:56 - 89:00)
dust clops dust flops correct (88:57 - 89:03)
dust clops is really good (89:00 - 89:04)
because you were like wow they had to (89:03 - 89:07)
make the spooky cup with only final (89:04 - 89:09)
evolutions because dust clop is too (89:07 - 89:11)
powerful (89:09 - 89:11)
and it was also recently featured in the (89:12 - 89:16)
pokemon go community day and also it is (89:14 - 89:18)
a middle evolution which the previous (89:16 - 89:22)
two pokemon were middle evolutions (89:18 - 89:22)
with that evil light (89:22 - 89:26)
uh was did we do trivia for dusk clubs (89:26 - 89:31)
last year yeah there's not a lot in (89:29 - 89:33)
august yeah (89:31 - 89:33)
hey do you know dust claps may be a (89:35 - 89:42)
combination of dusk and cyclops cyclops (89:37 - 89:42)
i just don't understand like the whole (89:42 - 89:46)
dust skull thing is like it's receiving (89:44 - 89:49)
transmissions from the other side what (89:46 - 89:51)
who's sending radio transmissions to (89:49 - 89:55)

i am not going to have any answers for (93:41 - 93:46)
you until i get to that new house so (93:43 - 93:48)
i appreciate your concern and trying to (93:46 - 93:50)
plan you're gonna have to wait till (93:48 - 93:52)
november for that because it is it is (93:50 - 93:55)
overdrive for me moving to another state (93:52 - 93:57)
um but that's that's happening the (93:55 - 94:00)
november 11th 12th and 13th and then (93:57 - 94:01)
brilliant diamond shining pearls the (94:00 - 94:02)
19th (94:01 - 94:03)

i believe i will also be streaming on (94:03 - 94:08)
thanksgiving day i'm just giving a heads (94:06 - 94:09)
up for that i know some people don't (94:08 - 94:11)
have family or friends to spend with on (94:09 - 94:13)
thanksgiving uh obviously i will be (94:11 - 94:16)
closer to my wife's family but (94:13 - 94:18)
um (94:16 - 94:19)
i don't like eating in front of people (94:18 - 94:21)
and i don't like group family things so (94:19 - 94:23)
i think she's gonna go to thanksgiving (94:21 - 94:25)
and i'm gonna stay at home and stream (94:23 - 94:27)
uh for you guys (94:25 - 94:28)
so if you need somebody to hang out with (94:27 - 94:30)

thursday and probably that friday for (94:30 - 94:33)
that weekend (94:32 - 94:35)
so a lot of a lot happening in the next (94:33 - 94:37)
month just want to lay it all out if (94:35 - 94:39)
you're a patreon subscriber (94:37 - 94:41)
uh you there's been two bonus podcasts (94:39 - 94:42)
this month there should be one more (94:41 - 94:44)
