what's up everyone welcome to the two hundred and fourth episode of the Pokemon podcast i am your host SBJ and with me today i have will yay great I have nothing Wow classics are great oh i just stumbled tripped and fell I was like quick quick think of a meme and then that means no memes to read for constant dialogue that's going in my head all the time is quick quick think of a meme the struggles you have and that other delightful voice you hear is Travis and early reports are coming back from Kalos it looks like Bernie Sanders is not going to get the lead he expected from the Kalos primary you mean Bernice and true Bernice and true and uh Hillary hmm oh ok quick think of me clin the time wait now it's hunting dragonite i don't like it clinton night it's surprisingly difficult to think of a fun of Hillary Clinton with dry I mean you could do like we got an old tiran Trump pretty really quick dilly Clinton yeah that one works that's pretty good that's bad that's yep mmm what's uh will heaven right well how was your week it I mean it's been pretty pretty low-key pretty lame I mean you heard me trying to play cooking mom on Friday night that was that was not going so haha like cooking mama you mean the division that's not the game that I was swearing at I was actually playing god of war and claiming i was playing cookie mama ok that's why i was swearing so much i'm not a fan of the god of war series i was having a good time um and then I've been reading rereading a wrinkle in time which i think i haven't read so i was 12 years old and it is certainly a diff book when you're an adult reading it and is it different good because I also think i read it when i was around 12 oh I'm loving it absolutely but it's like you pick up on things that the iris like totally it didn't even pass my comprehension when I was very young and reading it it's like when you watch movie when you're younger and then you pretty watch it again and you're like oh look at all these sexual references I had never picked up as a kid you know what that's exactly the experience because there's this whole thing right i don't know if anybody remembers or as if they haven't read it recently but you know you always think about alert okay fine 48 like 60 year old book compos now but like where the dad has disappeared and he's been gone for a year and you like the mom is kind of like I'm still young and just sayin but but she know she's not but she's like she has this very very quietly mentioned struggle of I'm still young and I you know I still love my husband but what am I doing with my life he's gone right and you just you don't when you're a kid you don't pick up on that at all well there you go it's it's a really good book it's it's a very interesting story with some very deep concepts and I bought the whole you can buy the whole uh all five books in the series for thirty dollars on your kindle so love my kindle uh you know i have not been a reader in a very long time and ever since i got that kindle I'm like I'm right last night you did not see me on the ps4 because i was reading a book no no one was on ps4 last night's presently i went to bed early to know i checked and because i always creep on you guys you and tyler we're playing final fantasy 14 and you killed odin because you were bragging about it on twitter yes that's true I Tyler wasn't on last night though because he was ps4 it might have been on but i was playing solo pretty much a la all right that's what i was saying Travis anything new with you i I've just been enjoying the weather all of a sudden it's actually more may was like in the 50s Fahrenheit today and yesterday and friday out of nowhere because it's februari in michigan and that's not supposed to happen so I mean everyone and that I've seen around this area is like losing their minds with how warm it is I was actually really concerned about you this morning Travis was as well because the first thing I do in the morning is turn on the news and the first thing that was on the news was about a really horrible thing that happened in Michigan overnight and I was like I don't know if that's anywhere near where Travis lives or not yea I'm guessing it's so horrible that we wouldn't want to talk about it on the show but program that I don't know what you're referring to you should tell me what that is after this I can know if I should watch out for anything if i should like all right well Steve can edit this if he feels like it he yeah I'll probably cut that up you should leave in just yeah I'll probably get that out man uh well let's see what's what's new here because we're not allowed to talk about pokemon for another minute and a half there's a joke in there somewhere so if you're active on the slack community or follow me on Twitter I've gotten pretty into Final Fantasy 14 which is on ps4 ps3 and pc and by the time you're listening to this the mac version should be available and you can cross play with everyone in every council and yeah that's really cool and if you are interested in getting to a getting into a fairly easy MMO our guild the it's super effective guild is recruiting new members and and if anyone knows me and when I get into a game i get i get deep into a game so I don't think with the destiny drought that I used to cling to have moved over to Final Fantasy for now and having a good time with it so you're interested in that and you have questions you can tweet at me or select me and I will fill you in about that otherwise of trying to write ours there are speaking of CAC cars we are on the server k oh wow well then I mean I have no reason not to because characters are like my favorite thing Hector is really cool um yeah photo coblos Coco Bianco's is so much cooler than chocobos yeah although you can feed your chocobos fruit and change the color of their feathers by what kind of fruit you feed them here is an actual conversation I tell my hair works here's how an actual conversation I have with Steve Steve are you writing a chocobo Steve responds no I have a unicorn yeah man I had a unicorn I'm real cool I play a healer and final fantasy 14 I really like its first time I've ever played a healer in an MMO good time oh speaking of MMO and final fantasy 14 this kind of relates to what we're going to be doing in in about a week Travis and I as as well as three other individuals will be doing a Pokemon d and these names cannot be so because they're in the witness protection program I mean I could rattle off names but unless good we're gonna be doing a I so when I say Pokemon DD what I really mean is D&D and I don't know what percentage of Pokemon equals that because you will not be dungeon mastering this game we're correct yes I will not be the DM or that is it diem or GM for Dungeons and Dragons it is DM for every other game because they cannot get because DM i think is a trademarked thing all the other games say GM game master okay but DM is Dungeon Master correct okay so we will be doing a X amount of I don't know how many weeks but it think of it like a TV show for two hours every week we're going to be doing some D&D on Twitch if you cannot see it on Twitch we will be recording the audio version and putting it up as part of a podcast it will probably be a separate podcast not too bogged down the eat super effective feed and the will still be doing our weekly it's super effective but let me pull up a calendar real quick just so i can get you guys dates first episode which will be us creating our characters will be on februari 29th then the next episode will be februari seventh and then every episode after that will be on tuesday so you're going to look at my said 50 or 7th i'm at march 7th so that in March fifteenth March 22nd March 29th we're just doing the first two episodes on Monday and then we're going to switch to tuesday for everyone because that's going to work better in the long run on everyone's schedule if we switch to tuesday first two episodes or monday just so we can start them get them out there and i've never played D&D before Travis is very experienced yeah played a lot of D&D still has no interest but you can at least hang out with us in the twitch chat will will has better things to do hahaha no i mean i'll probably be up in there making rude comments about your ridiculousness what if you have to be there because otherwise you wouldn't know if one of us named just named our character will and was just like the entire time making fun of you that's fine i think most people do that anyways play deity and the other characters will yep indicting then make fun of me the whole time no that's how I operate that's how I live my life in that firm belief that the rest of the world is making fun of me constantly oh that's not true while we're on this subject her for a little we should say that Greg who's gonna DM for us has home-brewed has has customized the game so that pokemon are involved in the world of dungeons and dragon i'ts so yes even I really have no idea what we're getting into but it should be super mystery dungeons and dragon i'ts that's really good that's actually really good what's funny about that is greg was one of the probably so greg was on as one of the kickstarter backers now that i say that were one case I'd her back er still has yet to be on though I just remembered that now but he was one of the most requested to come back just because somehow his rapport was very well liked and so somehow somehow say that like I somehow you upstaged me and people enjoyed his presence uh but uh well I mean there's a certain like misguided portion of our population that thinks Roselia and roserade is a quality Pokemon versus the actual garbage that should be taken out so there you go Greg fans Greg grothe what it would a script play a campaign campaign that's so weird Greg wrote the campaign last last fall so it's been done for a while I know he's put a lot of time and effort into it so I this isn't something that was a rush thing this is actually something we've been planning for a while and most the delays were just on my end so very excited to start it and hopefully you guys enjoy it and like I said earlier it's going to be broken down into think of it like a TV show so it'll come to an end with a season will start a second season if if at all it's popular and it catches on and then in that second season we could introduce maybe a new character maybe Travis gets hit by bus in real life and he can't be there so we we write his character out we had this got real grim and then we bring somebody else in edit that out give us a lot of dark references in this episode Wow total possibilities for other things if if it's popular and that would be up to our listeners if they want to watch or be invest in that and again I'll stress I've never done any of this before if you are not into D&D I am in the same boat as you and maybe that's that's something we can we can learn together if you care to watch oh let's say only all you need to know you're all the dice you move your bikes your mice the mouse's Wow am I the only one mouse trap uh okay I mean I've played mouse trap but there's more to it than that cuz you gotta actually builds a mouse trap that's what is in all of the marketing material it says you roll the dice you move your mice I think it's also referenced in see if i can tonight but I think in Jumanji because someone is saying like why we playing this game i miss mouse trap where you just roll the dice you move your mice it might not be Jumanji it might be a different way we all together but let's go to the phone see if I'm right call our number team go ahead i'm gonna say it's as a thorough oh yeah i forgot i got about g longines waiting which is amazing it's that's the second time we've talked about as if they were on this stupid podcast I mean only just brought it up what is the thorough it's Jim I in space Jumanji and space yes it was like was I on this episode yes what would you say well like six years ago then when we came home I don't know it's just human G except instead of a jungle game with animals it's a space game with robots Oh in 2005 Robin Williams in it oh that's just some kids no uh-uh who's that dude it's gotta dude I in it the good looking guy me uh uh not quite hey josh hutcherson is he like but what else has he been in ah so it gets more and more grim a psycho Hawk he was in The Hunger Games Mockingjay part 2 maybe the thorough stars Josh Hutcherson Yuko I don't know did you just look it up yes that's how you like your networks Dax Shepard dak Shepherd is the one maybe I don't know he's not that good-looking sounds like a mass effect character no the listeners a call in and tell us who the attractive man in Zathura was the prize is nothing a little before go ahead movin on movin kinda news ah we got quite a bit of news we can start with the news that I am NOT going to report on very well because I didn't watch any of it but for my understanding there was some video game comp over the weekend and it ended like an hour ago and somebody won that tho congrats do you mean regionals yes okay there were to regionals Los Angeles in st. Louis Los Angeles regionals is probably still going on do they usually stream regionals well that thing the last year was the first year they experimented with it now they its regional Nationals worlds hmm I did not yeah because I am there I think they're ramping it up more because they have Kyle working for them on the inside now and he goes out and post the streams and and the jwittz mm-hmm both of them team up and provide their commentaries so I think that they're kind of building out that arm of the organization yeah it is yeah it I it is what it is i looked up pokemon com i didn't see any like final results so we'll probably report on the next week if if there's something interesting there the other thing that recently ended is pokémon red burst open blue happened in splatoon as a flat fest and i think it was red and blue in every country except in Japan it was red versus green correct and the results came in this morning pokemon red across worldwide was the more popular team in every what incorrect nope listen and edit your statement listen pokemon red was the more popular team in every country except they lost in every country to pokemon blue and put my green well how does that work because more people picked pokemon red but pokemon blue one more games it's ugly suit shows pokemon blue wow I didn't know splat fest was so complex that it's two stats well did you think splat fest was just that uh that Oh original we channel where you voted on things everyone chill haha do you like Mario or link I used to love that gen of the channels not too good do you like cast her dog gather up on the different things yup and then like he's like bet on him too I wonder if they're gonna put that to me tomo they'll probably be a voting thing in me toma but yeah pokemon pokemon red uh in every country was more popular but pokemon blue and green one every single country so the skilled players were not the charizard pickers but i thought of that listen is that one can say Charizard school but you're just gonna lose that was a cool thing that Nintendo and Pokemon did and hopefully I mean I wish I liked splatoon more it's a very good game very fun it just didn't hold on to me like other game and what else we got so moving from one competitive game to another talk about poking I feel like we haven't talked about it enough we talk about it every week alright alright uh oh I got a couple pokin articles here is it March 21st the release date March 11 markku March 18th March 18th yes over a little little little less than a month away from pokin coming out on wii u uh I got a couple articles here we you Pokemon fighting game poking tournament gets nation wide open challenge anyone can compete compete in this open tournament the events will be held on February's 27th the 20 anniversary of Pokemon winners of each regional event will advance to the 2016 us now national championship that takes place on july first through third in columbus ohio the following game stops will host the qualifying tournaments may I point out that this tournament is well scheduled before the game eva comes out there's a little weird but anyways we have a couple locations you can qualify if you care to be a pokin champion at gamestop where there's one in plano texas I know I know what I said planta like clay clay no play now all right in Plato Texas they played 0 blem it up and Pluto Texas on preston road I want to play with not to eat in chamblee Georgia I'll let it lie all right in I bit i've actually been to the city avern I Verne California can't help you nope irvine irvine hell's going on ok there we go alright this is a tough city is it Orlando Orlando no I know it's Orlando I was that was making a joke orlando florida Chicago Illinois Bellevue Wash o union square new york new york and santa clara california so if you are near any of those cities you can look up more specific locations of what gamestop out of the hundred game stops in chicago would be the one to go to registration opens at ten a.m. local time competitions run from 11-2 five-thirty p.m. and there's a quote from the marketing executive of nintendo saying if you have fighting game skills and love all things pokemon but never had a chance to combine the two the pokin tournament early access competition is your chance to show off your skills i like that that statement conjures the image of someone who's sitting home at home and they have street fighter to ultra mega whatever because i'm not like 20 versions I game it was Street Fighter 2 in their right hand and they have like pokemon crystal in their left why can't I just have these at once well street fighter 5 just came out it did yeah it looks so good it does look so I'm street fighter 5 this may be more excited for pokin because who's your main in Street Fighter II uh well when I played to a lot it was Blanca that the one that's like a deal compra the electric electric chupacabra I also like a Honda a lot but I know he's not in five I actually don't know who is in five but anyways I was I got street fighter four when it first came out when like I feel like Street Fighter was very very hyped up when for came out I was super excited I got it played a couple games I was like looking at the move list going man this is really frustrating like it's very hard to learn learning curve his way up there played some online games completely got demolished never played street fighter four again cuz way too competitive and it sits at a very high skill level and then street fighter 5 came out just like last week and I was like man on street fighter 5 so bad because I like fighting him but I have no one to play with and I remember the disaster that was street fighter 4 and my ego and I don't I just wait for pokin huh so I'm very excited for poking because that's like street fighter has like I want a fighting game and poking is real close so I'll just hold out to that I'm poking looks good shoot we gonna do a poke em tournament I really uh wow what is that word whoa Oh help me I can't which no conventions and any of the conventions were gonna go to oh that was conventions like mgc and stuff yeah actually we could talk about mgc real quick so uh midwest gaming classic is in april in brookfield wisconsin it is a show that I've been going to this will be I could leave my six-year there they offered me a space upstairs normally i'm downstairs in a pretty big room i would say but the last two years we shared that room with nintendo nintendo asked if they could share the space with us we were like yeah definitely and and they were great guys but nintendo has a lot of things to give away and a lot of people want those giveaways and the room filled up extremely quickly and it was very hard to move around and I got very hot and I think we both both us and Nintendo agreed that this worked and would continue working if we got a bigger room but there are no it was a mutual decision right right there were no bigger rooms available so instead we took we both took smaller rooms but separate this is how divorce works oh hey cut that out yeah we'll just cut that up grim grim episode so what we're gonna be upstairs it's really exciting and it's gonna be a smaller room but the organizer was like hey pokin is going to be probably pretty popular this year are you guys going to bring poke into the show and I was like well I know I have a wii u and i know i'm getting pokin but if i want to do a tournament the tournament for no prizes by the way because that is technically against the laws in milwaukee county and that's a whole nother story but i do have a friend that i could borrow with you from i would probably have to go out and purchase another copy of poke in but it would be cool to ethernet to we use and do like a poker tournament over mid whiskey and classic so that is the plan well i don't know the extent of it but well are you coming to midwest um classic where did the dates i make me open my calendar again well then probably not it's i think it is april eighth ninth and tenth oh that's so close I know well silver a month away you get time travel look at this one Gretchen ones gencon gencon is August fourth yeah it's the first week in August we pretty much like just booked hotels for that whole week august 3rd 4th 5th 6th and 7th okay so yeah um and we we can talk about that closer closer to determinate and then well I'll also be at c2e2 doing a live panel that is Sunday March twentieth one 20th or 27th will arch 20 20th parch 20 20th uh in Chicago and we'll get to that we'll talk about that more as we get closer back to pokin though the question was asked is pokin coming to 3ds really and the answer is probably not oh yes that question I game spot okay okay not to be confused with games so a reputable cyl both whole video game company if you were hoping the upcoming pokin tournament would be eventually be released on three dias you better sit down it's not very likely that the fighting game will be making its way to the Nintendo handheld gamespot interviewed a few Japanese people with very complicated names about pokemon tournament and asked if there were any considerations bringing through the S it's definitely a challenge to get it on Wii U with what we were doing right now and it's definitely would be a challenge to have the same graphical experience on 3ds Hodari said that it's less about technology and more about needing the money to do it a programmer doesn't need technology a programmer needs a budget Adara said laughing poking tournament wakes its way to Wii U on March 18th one of the games that did make a leap from wii u 2 3 d s as hi We're warriors blah blah programmer doesn't need technology a programmer needs a budget it's a real good quote isn't it yeah so yeah pretty much was like I feel like it was pretty much like we would do it if they gave us the money too but they're not going to oh yeah mmm let's uh I don't think we've ever run through all the characters and poke and tournament so let's touch on that real quick the game to you got your weird new Mewtwo that isn't the same as normally teach angaar you got your Lucario but uh I'm probably Charizard right oh yeah mV okay so there are 16 playable characters currently added we have your Blaziken oh yeah you have you braixen sounds weird but you go yorkshire cool chandelure that one's weird but I hope Chandler is good because that's the one I want to play the most is it like punch with the yeah like Sanchez with this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we have your Charizard go figure we have your Garchomp I love for Gerta behavior Gardevoir gengar Lucario Machamp mute too Pikachu Pikachu Libre it is a different character hmm Sceptile shadow Mewtwo suicune and a weavile a lot of these pokemons are megas we won it Gengar Lucario Blaziken mega Charizard boykin mega Sceptile can mega i was looking at weavile and I'm like I wish there was a mega weavile that would be awesome wouldn't surprise me if that was coming and there are also 30 non-playable assist Pokemon that can be summoned in battle to aid the player these comes in groups of two pokémon so you have to pick both of them together you have snivy and Lapras Emolga and fennekin frogadier and EV run weird combinations sounds like Travis walked away versus Mike ins making a sandwich and was like yeah those are pretty weird as he's like buttering some toast a channel hold on a second butter jirachi and wednesdays kids out in store wins the sky can't even say it um mismagius and nine tails this is a good combination farfetch and electrode toaster togekiss and Rotom dragonite and Victini that one sounds a little Opie croagunk and sylveon Pachirisu and Magikarp that classic do you get your Q boat and diglett feel like there's a joke there somewhere uh Magneton and Quagsire espeon and Umbreon even tell that makes sense no no that's not even funny at all Nona Eva tell and latios that's a little weird wouldn't be Eva town xerneas well no wait so wat eos isn't represented no I don't think so just another case of the Oscars oh I know it's not that the Oscars have no women and them it's that Oscars are all white continue I did the joke wrong just keep going uh speaking of white rush ram and cresselia but no Zekrom knows that and is that Grumman latios I'll get a team maybe down the line hopefully watch yes ah yeah those are yours those are your 30 assists characters and those are your 16 main characters Daddo Mewtwo is exclusive to people who get the little card to unlock I believe I think you can't unlock him through standard plate that play playing the game but if you want to unlock him instance instantly you need that and I you do just need both card from getting Oh a theme evo card okay p.m. a book do you think there's gonna be more characters that will be added I read an article that there were no more planned characters but I don't have I cannot confirm or deny that because i don't have thee I don't know when or where I read that but i thought i did i would really unhappy i can't play as a sunkern yeah I don't I would imagine that adding a character would be a bit complicated just in terms of balance and my hash for us yeah yeah I hope that it's good i'm excited for it i hope that they do update it if you no charge Charizard has a flamethrower that's just 0 overpowered I hope that there's an update that says like charizard flamethrower has been reduced by point zero five percent to balance the game that'd be really cool just charizard charizard are already calling for Eddie up hashtag nerf chairs how come there's a Blastoise Hey yeah there's no bias toys like it goes mega Blastoise with the UM what is it called the what is your sink mega launcher I'd be so great there's not like hitmonchan Hitmonlee you figured those would be like obvious easy choices there's no primeape yeah probably would be so good a lot of fires I'd Pokemon yeah I we all knew that Pikachu was like a given and stuff it was it is just interesting to see pokemon like suicune and chandler make it in although i can't i can't be upset about Chandler but what will the Chandeleur mains am i right we had three more news articles but let's take a quick break we'll tackle those news articles and then we have a Pokemon of the week when we come back and we are back from our break more news for you the masuda sighed duck will be distributed in Pokemon Center stores in Japan to celebrate the Pokemon 20th anniversary pokemon game director masuda will be holding signing events at several Pokemon centers in Japan masuda psyduck will also be available at each signing session two players of only Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire people will be selected to participate in the signing sessions by lottery the signing sessions will be hold at the following times Pokemon Center mega Tokyo not to be confused with regular Tokyo on march third at 1pm pokémon center hiroshima on march 19 130pm and Pokemon Center pookie Yoko boo qo I think it's fujioka ok I'm March something like that more our resident ship Japanese expert Andrew will be more than happy to help us in the future with the here's the thing andrew is already multiple times told us how to pronounce I guess all of those things but that does not mean that any of the three of us have the memory to do it hey I think I got hiroshima pretty good no yeah it's the emphasis is on the oprah i think the o's are more like AWS so it's more like Hiroshima hmm like that and like Fukuoka will be back next week with proper Japanese cuz anything what I'm saying what I'm saying here is that Andrew has already taken the time to make videos of himself pronouncing these things correctly and I just feel bad that were but he doesn't get anything out of it I mean we're trying trap uh speaking of pronouncing things wrong yeah you sure yes I'm sure uh so the new pokemon mikania ya thank ya got an actual English name which i butchered last week and was corrected I don't have that name in front of you but i believe it's migire nah yes and obviously I and I said last week that I know I'm getting it wrong but and I was explaining to will because I saw mage ma GE and I didn't see gear and I was trying to think of like why did I miss that am i that dumb but then I'm looking at the Japanese name and i can say that very easily magana and then i was like oh ma g meg that's why i saw major 800 the japanese name is Maggie onna oh you know that's enough whatever the weather i say McGee near or ma guiana it still starts with mog that's true can argue with that Marjorie nuh so they really miss my but the butter pokemon it's not but arena so migire na is what were what we're going with right yeah look I would say I mean it is it is weird right how it's spelled mcgeer nuh it is certainly migire now but it's yes it is i'm i am on your side steve and that it is a weirdly it's hard to suss out how to pronounce it unless you think oh it's cuz it has gears yeah i just it's just it's shocking that we've come seven hundred and some pokemon later and we're still getting separate japanese and english names and Victini is a good example of a Pokemon name that is universal so you just look at magee nia or however you said that will well and like that look like an appropriate english name like that seem fine but but we wouldn't really get in English we would because they're all supposed to be puns and we wouldn't really get the pun there yeah that's true I mean it we don't really want Pikachu either but um I mean we get the pika and we get to chew am I missing something what what what pun in English this isn't it just like isn't like true the sound for in Japanese that might make and pika is like shine or something what I might be making it all up but Andrew less Andrew Hiller let us know Travis what are your thoughts of migire nah I think you already talked about it in the last one but it sure looks a lot like diancie but I think it's cool I mean I'm a fan of like clockwork things my d bunkie if they go steampunk fan no I draw the line okay I like I like clockwork robots I am indeed campaign right now centers around a bunch of clockwork robots there's no goggles there's no airships well let me ask you this sir Spacely sprockets or Cogswell cogs who do you pay for either of those things what I feel like they're both from fallout are you guys up wow you just literally killed me i'm dead i'm a ghost my bottom like spirit just jumped out of my body are you serious tumkur okey so grimace Oh grim have you done that out never wait wait wait have you never watched a classic television program called the Jetsons no I've never watched with George Jetson working for Spacely sprockets and their enemy company Cogswell cogs and they have like kids and they're all wearing space stuff got the robot Butler thing I get it it's fine it's not a butler she's a maid Rosie Wow oh my poor animals just woke up and they think something really that is happening cuz I'm dead let's let's rewind better eat oh um rewind a bit here I what was under the impression that this was going to be a pokémon related to Deon say mega dance a breakdancing Dion say but then I remembered by the way diancie had a great profession to the Super Bowl yeah yeah I agree Oh her to her new song is straight fire straight fire a fire it's pretty red but then I remember Pokemon does dumb things like Tauros and bouffalant and Luvdisc and aloha mora alum imola hello no it's a low mamola because it's a palindrome yellow mamola so mole I'm sure they'll have some deep lure explaining how so-and-so Pokemon and probably saw an image of Deeanne say and was like I want to build migire nuh but they will be completely unrelated but that's that'll be the connection because you can't not look at this new Pokemon and go what's what's the like uh game theory TM 10 things you didn't know about pokemon the you strength to move the truck to find Mew isn't there something about that with Jenna sack that gems like people think that genesect is like fossils like Kabhi tops or something oh yeah yeah wait do you want to know what is the pseudo Laura around migire nuh yeah sure that in omega ruby and alpha sapphire one of the evil teams was talking about project Azoth and Azoth is the city that volcania takes ash to in the upcoming movie where migire now will be revealed and you know mahira is a human-made pokemon mm-hmm and the pseudo lore is that AZ from the x and y games was founder of Azoff noticing how his name is repeated in there and he created magana to show his floette that he had regained his ability to love Pokemon it all comes full circle people do you steal what I posted in Slyke about that yes I'm like trying to Travis asked I'm trying to look for it but I lost it yeah but they were under the what will just said under the assumption that it was with a Z and everything like that I've heard worse things like if you look at magee Rinna's legs they look like they could plug into volcania on so that they're kind of like for mud what is it like some robots like one together like the drive like boat know it's like Voltron and then they form a greater Pokemon by the two of them combining together I'm listening that's all I have to said you had me at Voltron oh not massacre there you go dead silence you guys don't know your combo robots there's a joke in there somewhere let's heart let's ask the hard question here you think this is gonna be a new type or not steel fairy it's easy steel fairy hmm well beam it could be a new type yes undeniably steel fairy what new type is that uh well we got to Travis if you weren't paying attention the last 200 up so if we have moon type now how is that a moon good look the bottom part could easily be a moon it could be a pokeball as somewhat have been saying but it's exactly like a pokemon as a circle or okay go back up my theory of impossible i'm gonna know I'm gonna stop you there but moon type so then by those by the fact that it has a circle on it by those standards electrode Voltorb Geodude those are certainly all moon type Pokemon hey right that has no moon it's flatly steel fair is now a move I'm just saying moon Bert a moon bless anyway the real the real type that it could be is going to somebody so I'm still under the impression that there will be at point a sound type or something that revolves around all the moves that are sound based there's already a thing that revolves around a loser sound basis called sound proof they wouldn't know I don't there's no way i am i am the i am the old curmudgeon there's no way they would introduce a sound type when they have an ability sound proof that would just completely shut no now they couldn't make enough disabilities but somebody was suggesting that there could be a techno type yeah like a mecha type which does lean more towards my sound type and making that sound type of reality because when I said love type they introduced fairy and I was kind of close I knew they weren't going to call it love but fairy is pretty much what as close as they're getting with that so if it was a year else lv stands for love catch all these friendliness pellets i have no idea what to tell refer single listener of the show does i bet you every single listen to the show knows that i was referencing undertale about you know that's fantastic cuz i tried to enter a contest to win a free copy and i didn't so i said screw they seem not interested we all can have your memes all day long cuz i'll just mute you on twitter the first messy it is it 9 I don't care don't that there there are tons of people that are just dying and my sayings impression right now it was pretty good it was pretty good sustains or is isn't it's an SAT since Santa Cyrus stains roll back the tape of my son's house me rolling it back thanks type y'all can play your garbage non pokemon games all day long i'll be playing pokemon with the real people techno type could be a thing I agree so somebody second actually I'll kill you for a little bit what other pokemon fit in techno type I think you would have Magneton no sorry yeah no yes maybe Mike Magneton make that family correct that family yeah my resume Magnezone that's what I was thinking they're already steel electric you take other steel you're taking another steal yeah removing steel turning them into mecca's robbing them of see okay okay i said i'll give her you all hear you what else we got will something that's kind of like a robot the reggies all of them you would resume the reg's stop those are golems house are gonna mechanisms oh that is a spit in the face of Jewish mythology to call a golem a mechanical thing no the Golem is brought to life by the very word of God that is written on its forehead we're all familiar with the goal of mythology I don't think you are if you think is gonna be mech I'm saying I'm changing its types of that story no longer applies Oh Voltorb an electrode yeah which-which our pokemon that uses a lot of sound moves like screech and sonic boom what about the ghost robot from Rotom goer I olark is also just a golem try again nice No golurk strike two golurk was man-made made by human hands o our golems the robot well golurk could easily change type to that and maybe your definition of robot is a little too limiting that a golem couldn't be a robot maybe a goal on their original robots and there are things that are not little but obviously you learned too much in your philosophy courses sir and you need to roll it back a little bit let me it's a tune with the real ghost yeah and in my in my philosophy 302 class the anthology of robot well maybe you're a robot Travis Palace let me tell you it does not compute let me tell you the one Pokemon the one Pokemon family that would benefit the most out of a sound order will shock you the most of a sound or techno type that would be the porygon family yeah sure that's fair ah you could also do like star U star me really yeah cuz they're fan yeah cuz they're like space things yeah I agree your definitions of robot is is hey for grasping at wires there is there can be organic robots there can be spiritual robots don't know wait magenta sex genocide can can go with a techno 28 knows a move called techno blast by those standards how is it every Pokemon not a robot every Pokemon is robot that's why you can put them in the computer i will say that will may mom digital i will say that will made a great great point i think two weeks ago saying that they should give get away from normal type but there is no benefit of a normal you're at a disadvantage of using a normal type pokemon one was a really good defensive type though yeah until my map shows up relax is a great defensive pokemon because it's only week a fighting has the immunity to ghosts no it was a great defensive way it isn't a normal week against ground isn't that the thing no no all right Kari always in his week to ground which is weird to me but don't get that one yeah other arguments of well techno would be too close to steal but ground and rock are close but they're very different and water and ice are close but they are very different bug and poison are close but they're very different true so yeah I'm not saying that migire now couldn't be steel fairy it looks steel fairy but that doesn't rule out a new type and techno or technology first folks I am ruling out a new type as of what is this episode going to come out Steve februari 22nd as of februari the 22nd i'm calling it there will be no new type associated with migire nuh but you're not saying no new type altogether well i don't have all the facts you only all i know is i'm seeing this migire nuh and i'm saying that it has that is no way in relation to a new type I can neither confirm nor deny the allegations if there may be a new type in the next game but that theoretical new type will have no relationship to mogera so I ran a Twitter poll asking if people would want a new type fifty-two percent said yes forty-eight percent said no yeah I would love a new type but I would also love more pokemon and pokin tournament I would also like more pokemon games I just want everything so they introduced fairy because dragon-type was perceived to be too strong what would the new type be used to balance what do you think some balance right now Barry I think I think ice is real strong offense lightly ice is really bad defensively though but offensively like everything's using ice be just ice me good not as much anymore now that ferry exists because ice cream is included to combat dragons rockslide is probably the most Opie move ever in doubles yet yeah so rock rock type is too strong I feel like bug Pokemon still are way too weak feel like steel Pokemon our way two weeks to us though besides really sighs or I mean no one's using steelix its gladly you but you have like sighs or you have Heatran you have this is where is four times weak to fire he trained as a like a unique combination though of fire steel you mean getting that anywhere else but so even though steel has like a decent number of weaknesses its resistant to so much that it's pretty good and so many the combinations that it's paired with like what size or and like with you Tran and tell me out what other ones are there um Magneton even even like a magnet own right because one of its primary weaknesses is ground and you can add in like air balloon the fact that there's things like Heatran magnezone that double up on that ground weakness that can be effectively negated with air balloon makes it so that the weaknesses of Steel defensively are not as bad because you can pair it with other types and size or is a case where there's only one weakness wait fire I'll fire mmm wait fire I just said schizos or is four times weak to fire yeah that's all I really want to make it well I don't I want someone to make a parody of at the drive-in song one armed scissor about one arm size or someone someone could do that get back to me they actually had an email about my wrote in saying that they did not want a new type and they had a reason why um I'll look better probably just me it gets complicated enough as it is here we go here goes so we're not we're not going to do emails this week just because we still have one news article to talk about and we still have pokemon of the week but that doesn't mean you cannot send in your emails which would be at SBJ at pkmn casscom or you go to Pokemon podcast calm and hit the contact button you can send in an email but we will read Joseph Kay's email here just because I have it up Oh Joey k the only Joey k in it doesn't stay what date he's from Joseph rights in hey Logan Steve will and/or Travis since I mentioned him first Logan probably won't even be at the show today it's so good owner and the rest o in reply to Steve's comment in the last short episode adding a t-type for migire nuh I was one of the people that voted in the Twitter poll that i do not want it to see any new types for a while this wasn't necessarily because of the under the dark side this wasn't necessarily because b race your hatred of new types because of the long gap between darksteel and fairy or even because i thought it would be it would damage the metagame in some way though i do though i do think it would be a meat weird move in that regard instead i want to point out that rather than the first in a series of pokemon for generations seven which would imply new rules and maybe a new type the announcement of migire nuh seems to be on track and hacking on to the end of a generation 6 sort of artificially expanding the life of the current games in a similar way that Dion say and bikini on were intended to you so though they were leaked way before they were officially introduced that combined with the fact that McGee erna is starting to starring in a movie with volcania and could easily pass for this steel fairy-type makes me suspect suspect that this isn't the beginning of sound type or glass type when never heard that one before or whatever just some more usage of the fairy mechanic thanks for all you guys do and you should don't totally do torterra for pokemon of the week one of these days too bad don't choose another one yeah but we've done torterra in the past have we oh yeah look at that stupid tree thing yes Pokemon of the week written all over it I never heard of class type but that sounds real appealing too fragile also is ice mmm it brings new meaning to the phrase blast cannon I was gonna say glass house people in glass Pokemon shouldn't throw stones or whatever let me okay let's go over the pokemon that could be class type ah the crime magool thing crayon all that could be glass glass ice ah gonna weird he's real weird it's a real awesome Pokemon though what else could be glass nothing I don't think glass is a good tight just ha I can't take it it's haha all right all the one glass Pokemon crow naugle sure oh no oh alright moving on I am a good points good points in the in the email my only rebuttal to that would be why was it migire nut in the code like all these other legendaries were that were discovered early it's gonna be the code of Z of monsey pokemons emerald Pokemon omegas emerald speaking of pokémon Z the anime has debuted Pokemon X Y Z and will has seen the first episode yeah it was on yesterday it was it was pretty good pretty good or highly good now it was only pretty good i have some concerns about the direction they're heading but seeing as it's the first episode of a new season i will does that mean ash gets all his Pokemon reset are we back to square one no no no Newton new season not new series okay what is he sport give us a well I mean he's got his greninja um and the in the opening sequence they actually show ash greninja uh yeah he's got challah he's got man ha lucha such a cool pokemon yeah he's pretty cool um wow they actually had them all come out because they were introducing them to another Pokemon is bug still this is muck there no no Jen water God look just so cool sorry Jen ones living with having monkeys living with Professor Oak so you know I don't you know them at our school yeah no idea boy uh I mean he's got a lot of cool pokemon uh and and there's syrena's got hurt do you have our like harleston no way at that's black white number and dedenne is there looking all cute but here's the main thing and this is really i really think people should watch XYZ just because it has one thing that is very different than any Pokemon cartoon ever has we're in there is a Pokemon in the show that has never been in a Pokemon game and that is the forms of zygarde and they just had the first one show up and it was like what I actually tweeted a lot you as well weird the self they show all three and there's actually two types of cells this is three different ones or is it one that turned into all three it is three I'm not gonna split a rate that but there are actually two types of cells is one is a Rua and the ones that did 0 1 is a core and then one is a cell but um I was excited because for the first time at least as far as I know in whose that pokemon they so anyways right Bonnie who is Clements little sister she named the little zygarde core squishy and then when they did who's that Pokemon it was the zygarde core but when it came back is they came back and said who's that pokemon and it was like squishy because it doesn't exist as a real pokemon yet so they're really doing something interesting like with inverting the appearance of way to spoil I'm is that Pokemon it was squishy okay um hi what are you riding on that I find that very interesting NN at the end of the episode because most people probably if you don't watch it you're not going to watch it they did show along from the mega evolution specials crossing paths with ash and the gang so you know that they're going to have an interaction coming up so point of correction that isn't the first time they've had a Pokemon that hasn't been in a game in the UH all right okay the fight it was actually like a featured and interactive not like hoo in the big Chuck I'm talking about Muriel oh yeah yeah in the Pokemon movie and Pikachu's adventure these vacation yeah you're right okay I I will correct your correction because for as far as how the cartoon is not canon to the true story of Pokemon reality oh yeah yeah worse the movies have nothing to do with their reality of them and I'm glad I'm glad that's the fact i mean i've talked a few weeks ago but how weird it is that in the movie they imply that that ash is like the descendant of Lucario night man that's pretty weird hey once you make out with a pokemon like ash did you can do anything keep bringing that up this is more about you than it says about the moose Travis yeah can you give us an update on super mystery dungeon I haven't really played it all right there's your update pokemon rumble world physical copies coming out at the end of april i believe yes that was part of the news open that will i did have an email asking travis for his status of pokemon super mystery dungeon sorry we get on that they're just not grab you you just didn't have time the as I mentioned when we when we first talked about it there's like hours of gameplay that are still like technically the tutorial and it's just not grabbing me as a good way to put it because it's like if I go back I'm still in like tutorial missions oh it just blows me away yeah I checking last bit of news though that will mention is pokemon rumble world physical retail version set for north american release the physical retail version of the free to start nintendo 3ds eshop title pokemon rumble world has been confirmed for north america release on april 29th the physical game removes all microcurrent microtransactions present in the eShop version the player will immediately start with 3000 pokey diamonds and the pokey Diamond digger which will allow players to collect 40 more pokey diamonds once a day is that a lot of diamonds will 40 yes Wow I usually get like one at most two a day and I play every single day and I need like 50 more just to get another balloon the eShop version was released on April 8 2015 the physical version was released in japan on november nineteenth and in europe on january twenty second and australia I'm january twenty third though we will be we as in America will be getting at last but I wonder if it's the save data is separate from the eShop version like I wonder if you'd have to start over well if you bought the physical yeah I wondered that myself and I need somebody else to find out for me because I have far too much time invested in that game to like start over run the risk how much if you wanted to buy three thousand pokey diamonds though in the in the micro transaction one how much does that run you I think it was like if you spent thirty dollars you just unlocked everything yeah yeah I'm looking at it right now and it's uh 1,000 diamonds for 999 but you don't get the 40 a day yeah but once you buy five thousand diamonds it does something where it's like you never need to buy another diamond ever again okay okay got it all right well that wraps it up for news who'd have thought that was Pokemon news there by the when you're listening to this if you're listening to it the week of februari 22nd which this episode will come out there will be the pokemon 27th anniversary the following the this coming saturday 20th anniversary is that what I said you said 27th anniversary oh sorry I was Italy da button i was in my 50s it was uh it's odd februari 27th mixing up numbers it will be this saturday februari 27th 20th anniversary we do expect a game announcement then at least I expect it I think everyone here also expects something big to happen it's saturday hopefully travis and will and I can come back sunday morning and report and do a podcast of everything that will happen on saturday um so that is that is the plan expect this crew next week with your new glass type and or techno type to be revealed nah it's gonna make a site the Bekaa tech ah let's wrap wrap things up here with Pokemon of the week this week's pokemon of the week I've just been hitting random on bulbapedia and heat more was the first Pokemon that popped up heat more as a cool pokemon he is the ant eater pokemon it's very steampunk not enough years yeah but he's got that was she like coming out his back i like i like pokemon that have rivalries with other pokemon so um keep more in durant and seviper and mongoose pokemon what's his name Zangoose tinker's that's cool the old Mongoose Travis you gotta move set for heat more let's do something weird we're already picking heat more so let's do right kemo look heat mores it's a weird Pokemon it kind of doesn't really even fit with the aesthetic of Gen 5 it's kind of just there you're picking if you're picking he more you want to do something weird anyway so let's let's get weird we're going to do assault vest heat more now if you remember assault vest is an item that makes it so the downside is you can't use any moves that are nondamaging you have to use all damaging moves however assault vest is an item that the downside where you can't use any nondamaging rousseau all of your moves have to be damaging there's no status moves however it increases your special defense by 50% safety yep hang up it's pretty good fifty percent of your special your special defense right right let's get weird let's do assault vest eat more you're going to want flash fire because that's actually a pretty good ability makes you immune to fire attacks and makes your fire attacks more powerful when you aren't hit by a fire tech so you can have something like a size are out and then wow if your team has size or and eat more I have no idea what kind of person you are we're using like the most competitive Pokemon on the planet and eat more anyway you can have something four times a week to fire and then bait out a fire type moves switching to heat more it gets the flash fire bone is making its fire type moves stronger we want that fire-type move and that's going to be Fire Blast we're gonna do giga drain as well because it's kind of cool that it gets giga drain Focus Blast is another special attack move that it can learn um I had a fourth move over now now we already have Fire Blast um bit up no follow yeah that's what we're gonna know uh butter punch know yet any specialist we're going we're going special attack mmm belch oh I think I was just gonna do um I never even knew there was a move called belt but that'll belches Chloe it eats it eats your um your berry and that aura it only works if you've eaten a berry oh you could do a gluttony heat more belch more you could not probably just probably just like a kitten power hidden power whatever strikes your fancy so fire blast giga drain focus blast then hidden power i guess you'd want something good against you very got ground covered you've already got water covered rock you've already got rock coming with gay drain oh yeah dragon a hidden power ice sure give it that assault vest we were talking about give it a whatever the nature is that decreases your physical attack and well no scratch that just do modest that's probably because you're going to want to actually be able to take things out and then you can do 250 2 v's and HP and the special attack call it a day is it going to be good no you pick Tibor okay I like it I like that I heat more has a decent shiny it's like a dark like a rich red and like a darker black opposed to it's very mellow red and more of a brownish and as said earlier heat more as being the natural predator of Durant reflected on their types heat more and Durant share a lot of similarities they share the same a level rate they say share the same catch rate hatch time base experience yield total base stats and gender ratio and if you didn't know eat more is based on an anteater that is why it's the anteater pokémon that's not it it's uh appeared in me anime a couple times sure why not hey wheres pokemon out there now it's pretty cool mega heat more titled it mega hit more hit here we come Keeler's fine but it like so i always the sound of someone saying the new pokemon don't feel like pokemon is nails on the chalkboard to me which i'm sure i don't have to except sure i'd be preaching to the choir if I said why but heat more I think that Curtis isn't at megget i would get i would add matt i would add mecha type to eat more since he's got the tail pipe and the intake filters no but does have a tail pipe i just made me mad now well like I look at heat more in Durant like a lot like Durant would make a good mecha type there you go uh I look at heat more and Durant just like scyther and pincer they were just too cool pokemon that just fit together as a pair the differences Scyther got scizor the next generation and then eventually we got mega pincer you know 17 years later mega pins are so rad but yeah I just I just see those those two as like you can say all he more doesn't really fit like now he definitely fits he just he's just a single pokemon that has a rival and both those pokemon get forgotten together and they shouldn't cuz you're cool during it sweet I ran a really competitive Durant back three years ago and it was it was sweet mm-hmm it worked it worked some work some other Pokemon up and down it's true I was there there's a miraculous involved too Murr actus now that's the cool pokemon well I think that wraps up our show I will give a Pokemon a happy 20th anniversary in advance we will be back the day after their 20th anniversary to report on what has gone down I expect there will be a lot of pokemon stuff this week so check Pokemon podcast com for that I would lure twitter.com / Pokemon podcast yep I will do my judgment cast which is it I poke my podcast on Twitter all the way spelled out I will do my best to get that updated as fast as possible obviously we're not known for reporting a news coverage but if there's solutions were the first sometimes it's better times when like people are trying to like stamp their their watermark out it or whatever yeah but we're just like oh we don't care we don't have it we don't need to expand the brand right yeah I don't need a watermark a PNG that Pokemon has sent me to put on my website they sent it to everyone i will just tweet it out and if i get new PNG's and JPEGs this week you will see them on twitter before anyone else cuz i just tweet them instantly for anyone to use because eventually they will show up on bulbapedia and you will use them anyways uh Travis is at d travis w you got it will is at wash in the sink I am it I am I am at dragging a lake you got it this has been another episode of the Pokemon podcast and we are super super effort values
