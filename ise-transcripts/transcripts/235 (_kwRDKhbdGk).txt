what's up everyone welcome to the (0:21 - 0:27)
235th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:24 - 0:31)
it's super effective I am your host SP J (0:27 - 0:33)
and with me is just it's just the two of (0:31 - 0:38)
us Travis is with me today just the two (0:33 - 0:42)
of us we can make it if we try just the (0:38 - 0:47)
two of us just the two of us didn't (0:42 - 0:50)
quite it's more like just the two I (0:47 - 0:53)
think it's up there um hey how are you (0:50 - 0:56)
good you got a pretty decent singing (0:53 - 0:58)
voice Travis thanks Steve most people (0:56 - 1:00)
just make fun of me no it's good I'm (0:58 - 1:04)
super toned deaf when it comes to (1:00 - 1:04)
anything things are good I didn't want (1:04 - 1:10)
to talk about Destiny but I guess we're (1:07 - 1:12)
I guess we're here I mean you're you're (1:10 - 1:14)
singing you can't say I forced you into (1:12 - 1:16)
doing it because all I did was sing just (1:14 - 1:18)
the two of us you reminded me of that (1:16 - 1:20)
because there is a an achievement in (1:18 - 1:22)
destiny that you have to ring Seven (1:20 - 1:24)
Bells and you need more than one person (1:22 - 1:27)
to do it so me Irene Micah and my friend (1:24 - 1:31)
Tyler are are like there's six spells so (1:27 - 1:33)
we have to like move between them to (1:31 - 1:35)
ring them in a certain order pretty much (1:33 - 1:37)
we have to play the song that the rise (1:35 - 1:41)
of iron song from the new expansion and (1:37 - 1:42)
they were like well as soon as you hear (1:41 - 1:44)
the Bell you know move to the next one (1:42 - 1:46)
and get ready and I was like honestly (1:44 - 1:49)
guys I think all the bells sound exactly (1:46 - 1:52)
the same and I know they don't but you (1:49 - 1:53)
just have to tell me what the Bell's (1:52 - 1:56)
number like don't tell me that it it (1:53 - 1:59)
wrong just give me the number let me (1:56 - 2:00)
know I'll move (1:59 - 2:03)
uh after we played the song I still I (2:00 - 2:06)
didn't hear any song I just heard (2:03 - 2:08)
gongs but we did it we got the (2:06 - 2:11)
achievement I can't hear anything maybe (2:08 - 2:14)
that's good or bad in a talking only (2:11 - 2:17)
podcast well I mean it just goes to show (2:14 - 2:20)
that uh you know you stick with your (2:17 - 2:21)
strengths we're not going to be starting (2:20 - 2:24)
a a musical version of ISC anytime soon (2:21 - 2:27)
not yet not with that attitude (2:24 - 2:30)
Travis what's uh what's new with you (2:27 - 2:32)
still been playing Pokémon go I realize (2:30 - 2:33)
I'm probably the last person on Earth (2:32 - 2:36)
although I'm I'm not the last person on (2:33 - 2:39)
Earth and your's proof my city has and I (2:36 - 2:41)
realize this is true of a lot of places (2:39 - 2:45)
but Grand Rapids is has a very small (2:41 - 2:48)
team Instinct presence if the the gyms (2:45 - 2:52)
are to be uh indicative of the (2:48 - 2:55)
population okay to the to the extent (2:52 - 2:58)
that until today I had never seen an (2:55 - 3:00)
instinct gym that lasted more than than (2:58 - 3:03)
a day I discovered a level six Instinct (3:00 - 3:06)
gym uh kind of by where I live but I was (3:03 - 3:09)
walking aways and there was just a level (3:06 - 3:12)
two Mystic gym pretty close to me it was (3:09 - 3:16)
before that it was pretty high level so (3:12 - 3:19)
I thought oh it's only level two right (3:16 - 3:23)
now I can take it so I went out and I oh (3:19 - 3:25)
no it was Valor it was Valor and so I (3:23 - 3:27)
went out and I and I took over the gym (3:25 - 3:29)
and I kept walking to the next Poké stop (3:27 - 3:34)
and nearest me and I turned around after (3:29 - 3:36)
reaching that Poké stop and it was maybe (3:34 - 3:38)
10 minutes later and there was already (3:36 - 3:41)
some dude parked by that gym taking it (3:38 - 3:44)
back for Valor in the span of like 10 (3:41 - 3:48)
minutes so I still think that situation (3:44 - 3:51)
is weird and I've done it I've been in (3:48 - 3:53)
that situation where I pull my car over (3:51 - 3:56)
on the side of the road to do something (3:53 - 4:00)
in Pokémon go and it obviously cuz you (3:56 - 4:02)
want to be safe and everything but to (4:00 - 4:05)
see somebody on the side of the road (4:02 - 4:07)
looking at their phone and you're (4:05 - 4:09)
playing Pokémon go so you know you know (4:07 - 4:10)
exactly what they're doing it's still (4:09 - 4:15)
like a why this game exists and it's (4:10 - 4:18)
there and it's still weird I think to me (4:15 - 4:20)
at least I don't know well the weirdest (4:18 - 4:24)
thing is that the dude was on call I (4:20 - 4:26)
mean either it was a coincidence that he (4:24 - 4:30)
happened to be driving by right after or (4:26 - 4:32)
or perhaps he lives very close and could (4:30 - 4:37)
see from his house the that the Instinct (4:32 - 4:40)
filth that I am took over his gym and (4:37 - 4:42)
hopped in the car but even still that's (4:40 - 4:45)
a weird action to make to say stop (4:42 - 4:47)
everything I need to go and take back (4:45 - 4:49)
the gym next to the McDonald's that's (4:47 - 4:53)
kind of odd um the best part is that as (4:49 - 4:55)
I walked by cuz I had to you know walk (4:53 - 4:58)
by on my way back to my apartment I saw (4:55 - 4:59)
him in his car and I just gave a little (4:58 - 5:01)
wave (4:59 - 5:03)
like like we're both here for the same (5:01 - 5:06)
reason and I know that the the uh the (5:03 - 5:09)
cruel thing that you just did to my poor (5:06 - 5:13)
the the one of of two Instinct gyms in (5:09 - 5:15)
like 50 square (5:13 - 5:18)
miles uh let's do a healthy living (5:15 - 5:21)
update here so are do you consistently (5:18 - 5:24)
walk are you a walker are you one that (5:21 - 5:27)
moves the legs across the sidewalks I (5:24 - 5:30)
really enjoy walking and and biking (5:27 - 5:35)
I it took Pokemon go for me to get back (5:30 - 5:39)
into walking since I graduated from (5:35 - 5:42)
college I guess I haven't been as good (5:39 - 5:44)
at getting on my bike or going for a (5:42 - 5:46)
walk but when I was in college I went on (5:44 - 5:50)
a lot of bike rides and and walks um and (5:46 - 5:51)
then I kind of let it drop off but (5:50 - 5:53)
Pokemon go has provided the incentive (5:51 - 5:56)
for me to walk again I see what about (5:53 - 5:58)
you still drinking the water and (5:56 - 6:00)
drinking the soilent I I I consider (5:58 - 6:02)
soent Healthy Living because it's my (6:00 - 6:05)
alternative to then sure going to (6:02 - 6:06)
McDonald's right anything has to be (6:05 - 6:09)
better than that yeah I had a listener (6:06 - 6:12)
though right in um after our big Fiji (6:09 - 6:14)
Water debate and they wrote in this (6:12 - 6:16)
pretty long email and they attached a (6:14 - 6:18)
link and my apologies for not having (6:16 - 6:20)
that email up but they pretty much asked (6:18 - 6:24)
me not to buy and drink Fiji Water and (6:20 - 6:25)
they said I should just stick to Smart (6:24 - 6:29)
Water both Waters I enjoy a lot and the (6:25 - 6:30)
water debate (6:29 - 6:33)
of you know the those are more expensive (6:30 - 6:36)
Waters and I think they taste obviously (6:33 - 6:39)
different than tap water and I think a (6:36 - 6:41)
lot of tap water tastes different too I (6:39 - 6:42)
might be toned deaf but I feel like I (6:41 - 6:44)
can taste the difference in a lot of (6:42 - 6:47)
different Waters all of the your ability (6:44 - 6:49)
to differentiate tones has has been (6:47 - 6:51)
channeled into your ability to (6:49 - 6:54)
differentiate taste right I usually only (6:51 - 6:57)
drink smart or Fiji Water or I should (6:54 - 6:59)
say I should only I only buy those (6:57 - 7:02)
different too and when I was at the (6:59 - 7:04)
store I forgot to buy and I was at (7:02 - 7:06)
checkout and I turned around and I was (7:04 - 7:10)
like ah Dan I guess 24 for $4 sure and I (7:06 - 7:13)
just bought that and I know Dan's made (7:10 - 7:16)
by Coke I believe uh I know that it's (7:13 - 7:20)
probably it's probably tap water um but (7:16 - 7:22)
24 bottles of water for (7:20 - 7:25)
$4 uh that is a heck of a deal compared (7:22 - 7:30)
to SmartWater which is like $6 for six (7:25 - 7:33)
right so I think that what do you like (7:30 - 7:35)
what am I I'm like working my way back (7:33 - 7:38)
down to tap water because I'm definitely (7:35 - 7:40)
by step yeah I'm definitely okay with (7:38 - 7:42)
danani now and I and I don't know if I (7:40 - 7:44)
told the the the story to the listeners (7:42 - 7:48)
the reason why I hated water like I was (7:44 - 7:51)
a very like six cans of soda a day kind (7:48 - 7:54)
of guy um when I was trying to get (7:51 - 7:57)
healthier I started with water Joe (7:54 - 8:00)
actually which was water with caffeine (7:57 - 8:02)
which is fine it's it's it's good but (8:00 - 8:04)
that's what I drank in the morning when (8:02 - 8:06)
I like went off soda for 30 days and uh (8:04 - 8:09)
yeah so yeah I'm working my way back (8:06 - 8:10)
down to kind of being okay with any (8:09 - 8:12)
water so I think I'll stick with danani (8:10 - 8:13)
for now unless there's something bad (8:12 - 8:16)
about danani but Coke makes both smart (8:13 - 8:20)
water and so healthy living update we (8:16 - 8:22)
got a show for you guys today 8 minutes (8:20 - 8:25)
in let me lay out the show here we got (8:22 - 8:28)
the third Pokemon generations (8:25 - 8:30)
short we have (8:28 - 8:33)
four new Pokémon to talk about a couple (8:30 - 8:35)
small (8:33 - 8:38)
articles and then if you're new listener (8:35 - 8:39)
or if you're here and you made it past (8:38 - 8:41)
the first8 minutes of Pokémon go and (8:39 - 8:46)
water talk we have an interview with (8:41 - 8:49)
Adam who is also probably known better (8:46 - 8:53)
as gyen Hunter he does the YouTube (8:49 - 8:56)
videos of the weapon tutorials and the (8:53 - 8:59)
item tutorials in Monster Hunter 4 You (8:56 - 9:01)
Monster Hunter Generations monster (8:59 - 9:05)
hross he is an American that moved out (9:01 - 9:07)
to Japan when he was 21 he's been in (9:05 - 9:11)
Japan for 16 years uh he just got up and (9:07 - 9:13)
pretty much went to Japan without (9:11 - 9:16)
knowing much of the language from my (9:13 - 9:17)
understanding he learned it mostly while (9:16 - 9:21)
he was there uh so that if if his (9:17 - 9:24)
Twitter or his his talking about being (9:21 - 9:25)
on the show has brought you here uh that (9:24 - 9:28)
interview is about an hour long and (9:25 - 9:30)
should probably here I don't know like (9:28 - 9:32)
45 minutes to an hour into the show I'm (9:30 - 9:35)
not exactly sure how long Travis and I (9:32 - 9:37)
will ramble about the stuff we have and (9:35 - 9:41)
then after that uh so uh Adam does talk (9:37 - 9:43)
Pokemon go as well as some other Pokemon (9:41 - 9:46)
stuff but we do talk a bit about Monster (9:43 - 9:47)
Hunter and like getting into Monster (9:46 - 9:50)
Hunter people uh First Impressions with (9:47 - 9:52)
monster hunter stuff like that because (9:50 - 9:54)
monster hunter is a super intimidating (9:52 - 9:56)
game but I think there's a lot of (9:54 - 9:57)
overlap between the Monster Hunter (9:56 - 9:59)
community and the Pokemon community and (9:57 - 10:01)
we also talk about that so then he (9:59 - 10:02)
requested the Pokemon of the week which (10:01 - 10:04)
Travis has and he will make a move set (10:02 - 10:07)
for but with that being said let's dive (10:04 - 10:10)
into some (10:07 - 10:15)
news first bit of news here is the 19th (10:10 - 10:20)

front uh I don't know if it comes with (11:24 - 11:28)
anything or if it's just you know eight (11:26 - 11:33)
eight DV s this is weird cuz wasn't the (11:28 - 11:36)
the jodo anime not really even called (11:33 - 11:39)
gold and silver cuz it was Pokemon jto (11:36 - 11:40)

they're calling it I (11:40 - 11:44)
mean yeah exactly yeah I don't know (11:41 - 11:46)
maybe Australia had different naming I (11:44 - 11:48)
just know we have a lot of uh a lot of (11:46 - 11:49)
listeners from Australia so I figured (11:48 - 11:52)
that news was worth covering Gerra (11:49 - 11:55)
wishmaker and Destiny the AIS also (11:52 - 11:57)
coming to (11:55 - 12:00)
Australia and that also so and and (11:57 - 12:02)
Pokemon Forever Cel be the voice of the (12:00 - 12:06)
force Pokemon Heroes Latios and (12:02 - 12:09)
laas some hot ashon Pokemon action in (12:06 - 12:12)
that movie from what I've been told uh (12:09 - 12:14)
those are coming you from what you've (12:12 - 12:16)
been told by you because you perpetually (12:14 - 12:18)
bring that up every time anyone mentions (12:16 - 12:20)
that movie don't act like you weren't (12:18 - 12:22)
the person who brought that topic to (12:20 - 12:25)
this podcast every (12:22 - 12:28)
time you're not wrong that's that's (12:25 - 12:31)
coming I just I just hope at some point (12:28 - 12:34)
we figure out what your fixation with is (12:31 - 12:38)
with Ash kissing latas I hope we can (12:34 - 12:41)
have that psychological Deep dive to (12:38 - 12:43)
figure out why that in (12:41 - 12:47)
particular tickles you so I mean if you (12:43 - 12:49)
were to pick one moment in a movie that (12:47 - 12:52)
is the that's the moment in that (12:49 - 12:56)
movie maybe for some people Steve those (12:52 - 12:58)
are all coming uh in Australia on (12:56 - 12:59)
November (12:58 - 13:03)
9th the Pokemon Forever Pokemon Heroes (12:59 - 13:09)
and Gerra will use a 4.3 aspect ratio uh (13:03 - 13:11)
gross uh Destiny Deoxys will be (13:09 - 13:16)
widescreen 16 to9 I'm sorry Australia (13:11 - 13:18)
that is I'm pretty sure those movies (13:16 - 13:20)
were shot in widecreen I definitely it's (13:18 - 13:22)
full screen you get the you get the full (13:20 - 13:26)
experience right that's how it works oh (13:22 - 13:31)
that's what my mom used to say (13:26 - 13:32)
I don't want to be I don't want to be (13:31 - 13:34)
missing anything with (13:32 - 13:36)
widescreen I (13:34 - 13:39)
think she was always like full screen is (13:36 - 13:40)
the full movie Why screen you get black (13:39 - 13:44)
bars you don't get as much of the (13:40 - 13:47)
movie this is when we had those (13:44 - 13:50)
CRTs I think thankfully most that that (13:47 - 13:53)
misconception has died away can you even (13:50 - 13:56)
buy stand do they call it standard no (13:53 - 13:57)
they call it full screen can you even (13:56 - 14:01)
buy full screen I'm sure like Walmart is (13:57 - 14:05)
nothing but like full screen $5 movies (14:01 - 14:08)
it has to be speaking of my mom uh she (14:05 - 14:11)
didn't have her car on Friday and (14:08 - 14:12)
Saturday so I had to take her take her (14:11 - 14:14)
to work one day and then take her home (14:12 - 14:20)
the next my mom was pretty into Pokemon (14:14 - 14:22)
when it first came out she oh really (14:20 - 14:25)
yeah she really liked uh she played my (14:22 - 14:28)
sister's red so for Christmas my sister (14:25 - 14:31)
got red I got blue cuz obviously blue is (14:28 - 14:34)
a boy's color and red is very like red (14:31 - 14:36)
red is the girls color duh (14:34 - 14:39)
um so my sister not the biggest gamer (14:36 - 14:43)
but we both had game boys and I was 100% (14:39 - 14:46)
completely sucked into blue obviously (14:43 - 14:48)
and my mom and my sister kind of shared (14:46 - 14:50)
a cartridge because uh my sister would (14:48 - 14:52)
have a lot of difficulty with the game (14:50 - 14:53)
even though she was like older than me (14:52 - 14:56)
and and whatnot but uh my mom was a big (14:53 - 14:59)
fan of uh like the Squirtle line and (14:56 - 15:01)
everything and so she yeah she (14:59 - 15:04)
played she played some Pokemon she also (15:01 - 15:06)
loved the mini games in Pokemon Stadium (15:04 - 15:08)
my mom one of the biggest Mario Party (15:06 - 15:11)
fans in the world so when when you take (15:08 - 15:13)
those mini games out and you add Pokemon (15:11 - 15:16)
to them that she was she was 100% in for (15:13 - 15:18)
that just loved the mini games in (15:16 - 15:22)
stadium she loved Pokemon Snap big big (15:18 - 15:24)
who didn't love Pokemon Snap is the (15:22 - 15:28)
better true as as Pokemon progressed um (15:24 - 15:30)
oh she loved Pokemon on pinball as well (15:28 - 15:33)
big pinball fan kind of as I got older (15:30 - 15:35)
and we moved away from the Nintendo 64 (15:33 - 15:37)
and we moved away from the game boys uh (15:35 - 15:39)
she didn't really play Pokemon as much I (15:37 - 15:41)
mean she still played like the newer (15:39 - 15:44)
Mario Karts and stuff like like right (15:41 - 15:45)
now my I would say my mom is the Candy (15:44 - 15:48)
Crush gamer the like little like iPhone (15:45 - 15:51)
slot machine kind of thing um definitely (15:48 - 15:53)
still into Mario Party and stuff but (15:51 - 15:56)
anyway so I'm I'm I'm taking her to work (15:53 - 15:58)
bringing her home and we're just talking (15:56 - 16:00)
about stuff I was telling her about the (15:58 - 16:02)
destiny expansion cuz she was asked why (16:00 - 16:03)
she asked why I was up till like 6:00 (16:02 - 16:05)
a.m. and then she was like oh do you (16:03 - 16:08)
still play Pokémon go and I was like (16:05 - 16:11)
yeah yeah like maybe an hour or so a (16:08 - 16:13)
week nothing religiously and she was she (16:11 - 16:17)
like had things to say about Pokemon go (16:13 - 16:20)
like she has been in in the deep end (16:17 - 16:24)
with Pokemon go and I love how so I (16:20 - 16:26)
butcher Pokemon names all the time I (16:24 - 16:29)
think that's that's both frustrating for (16:26 - 16:31)
people and also enjoyable for people (16:29 - 16:33)
from what I've been told but my mom (16:31 - 16:37)
called Vaporeon she was like my highest (16:33 - 16:38)
my highest Pokemon she always says (16:37 - 16:42)
Pokemon too my she's like what's your (16:38 - 16:43)
highest Pokemon and I was like I don't (16:42 - 16:45)
know mom probably like like 12200 so (16:43 - 16:48)
she's like that's it she's like she's (16:45 - 16:51)
like this is mine she's like this is my (16:48 - 16:54)
my Viper Manon and it I was like excuse (16:51 - 16:56)
me and I looked at the screen I was like (16:54 - 16:59)
Mom that's Vaporeon and you're one to (16:56 - 17:01)
talk though it runs in the family it (16:59 - 17:06)
does it does I was RA I I was raised (17:01 - 17:08)
with both I I did have I had a speech I (17:06 - 17:09)
don't know if I've ever said this I had (17:08 - 17:12)
a really really bad speech problem as a (17:09 - 17:16)
kid uh and I I when I was in elementary (17:12 - 17:19)
school I got pulled out of class uh I (17:16 - 17:21)
was you know you have 32 kids in a class (17:19 - 17:23)
or whatever at least my elementary (17:21 - 17:25)
school did and I was pulled out uh every (17:23 - 17:29)
single day at like 2 p.m. uh for speech (17:25 - 17:32)
and I thought I I was both excited cuz I (17:29 - 17:34)
felt special that I I was like (17:32 - 17:37)
handpicked to like do this extra (17:34 - 17:39)
activity but I also felt a little like (17:37 - 17:41)
disappointing that I felt like I was (17:39 - 17:43)
missing something I don't remember much (17:41 - 17:45)
about elementary school but I remember I (17:43 - 17:49)
couldn't say the word boat and all I was (17:45 - 17:51)
trying to say was like you know as a kid (17:49 - 17:53)
I feel like most kids are very excited (17:51 - 17:56)
about like trucks and right and buses (17:53 - 17:57)
and like trains and everything and I (17:56 - 17:59)
think like for the first time time as (17:57 - 18:01)
like a five or six year-old or however (17:59 - 18:03)
old I was I like saw my first boat and I (18:01 - 18:05)
was trying to explain that to my teacher (18:03 - 18:07)
as my mom was dropping me off and they (18:05 - 18:10)
were both looking at me and I was like (18:07 - 18:11)
like I said I was like five or six and (18:10 - 18:15)
I'm like crying uh because I just wanted (18:11 - 18:17)
to tell them I saw a boat and the word I (18:15 - 18:18)
was (18:17 - 18:20)
saying they just didn't understand they (18:18 - 18:23)
didn't know yeah and so yeah I have a I (18:20 - 18:25)
had a speech problem I clearly obviously (18:23 - 18:27)
still do have a speech problem like I (18:25 - 18:29)
can't say the word volume uh (18:27 - 18:33)
and some other type of words and I get I (18:29 - 18:35)
get a little a little hassle for that on (18:33 - 18:36)
stream or whatnot and that's totally (18:35 - 18:40)
fine I I I I think that people laughing (18:36 - 18:41)
at the fact that I can't say certain (18:40 - 18:45)
words is like slightly like makes me (18:41 - 18:47)
glow on the inside that like just I can (18:45 - 18:49)
make somebody laugh and that's fine and (18:47 - 18:51)
they joke about it but my (18:49 - 18:54)
mom definitely knows Weedle she has no (18:51 - 18:56)
problem saying like expressing her hate (18:54 - 19:00)
for Weedle to me and um (18:56 - 19:04)
uh she she calls Pidgey the bird she (19:00 - 19:07)
calls Atkins the (19:04 - 19:07)
snake she calls Eevee the (19:09 - 19:16)
dog so she's very like very uh very (19:12 - 19:19)
stuck in like why doesn't she call (19:16 - 19:21)
Vaporeon why didn't she call viperm the (19:19 - 19:26)
water dog the water dog right um she her (19:21 - 19:28)
favorite Pokemon is zaptos so she was on (19:26 - 19:31)
team Instinct she was very uh upset with (19:28 - 19:34)
me that I was on on t- Mystic and I was (19:31 - 19:37)
like I just I just liked ticuna more (19:34 - 19:41)
than and than molri and and zaptos um (19:37 - 19:43)
but her favorite thing in Pokemon go (19:41 - 19:45)
which which I thought was interesting (19:43 - 19:47)
her her absolutely favorite thing was (19:45 - 19:52)
hatching eggs mhm uh and and to me I (19:47 - 19:55)
don't yeah they're there but I don't I I (19:52 - 20:00)
just think it's that it's cool cool that (19:55 - 20:03)
Pokémon go is this pretty simple game (20:00 - 20:06)
and for her to be like this is my (20:03 - 20:08)
favorite part is when an EG egg hatches (20:06 - 20:10)
and when I go to a poké stop and I get a (20:08 - 20:11)
new egg and I can get ready for it to (20:10 - 20:13)
hatch and yeah I just I just thought (20:11 - 20:16)
that was interesting I want to secretly (20:13 - 20:19)
I want to like record record a (20:16 - 20:21)
conversation with me and my mom and her (20:19 - 20:24)
telling me her love of Pokémon go and (20:21 - 20:27)

20th so if you have not not been to (21:55 - 22:01)
Pokemon symphonic Evolutions I (21:59 - 22:03)
definitely think that is if you're (22:01 - 22:05)
listening to this podcast you're clearly (22:03 - 22:08)
a Pokemon fan and if you haven't treated (22:05 - 22:10)
yourself to to symphonic Evolutions I (22:08 - 22:13)
think there's two ticket ranges there's (22:10 - 22:15)
the $35 tickets and the $75 tickets just (22:13 - 22:19)
get the $35 tickets go with a friend uh (22:15 - 22:21)
I feel like it's like one of the best (22:19 - 22:23)
and most entertaining two to three hours (22:21 - 22:25)
that you could have as a Pokemon fan I (22:23 - 22:28)
think I have i' I've been to two I think (22:25 - 22:30)
Will's been to two or three just they (22:28 - 22:34)
just seem to be in the the DC area a (22:30 - 22:35)
little more and from my understanding (22:34 - 22:36)
talking with some of the people that (22:35 - 22:39)
work on that show uh they do switch up (22:36 - 22:42)
the songs a bit like I said I think it's (22:39 - 22:44)
definitely worth going um if you want (22:42 - 22:46)
more information for that Pokemon (22:44 - 22:50)
symphony.com uh to check that out uh (22:46 - 22:53)

beam and everyone's favorite (23:45 - 23:54)
Lear that's an odd pick there I have a I (23:50 - 23:58)
I just had a flashback I I don't know I (23:54 - 24:00)
remember what tournament it was for it (23:58 - 24:01)
must have been (24:00 - 24:04)
before (24:01 - 24:04)
Nationals it must have been (24:04 - 24:10)
before H it I mean my memory might be (24:07 - 24:14)
completely incorrect but I remember a an (24:10 - 24:17)
argument that I did not partake in but (24:14 - 24:22)
instead just watched uh in the chat box (24:17 - 24:23)
of I don't know if it would have been (24:22 - 24:26)
Pokemon Showdown or yeah I guess it (24:23 - 24:27)
probably would have been showdown at (24:26 - 24:32)
that point um where CIO had not yet come (24:27 - 24:35)
out and a tournament was around the (24:32 - 24:37)
corner and kelia was supposed to come (24:35 - 24:39)
out before the tournament and people (24:37 - 24:41)
were arguing about whether or not kelia (24:39 - 24:44)
would completely Break The Meta upon its (24:41 - 24:46)
release or not and maybe I'm making all (24:44 - 24:48)
this up but I have a vague memory of (24:46 - 24:50)
seeing that argument happen and if (24:48 - 24:52)
memory serves it did not shake up the (24:50 - 24:54)
Met as much as people thought although (24:52 - 24:56)
it is a very good Pokemon remember in (24:54 - 24:59)
the TCG cellio was was extremely popular (24:56 - 25:02)
with uh a Blastoise deck I heard the (24:59 - 25:04)
movie was bad I have that was one of one (25:02 - 25:06)
of the few movies I have not (25:04 - 25:10)
seen is the Keo movie speaking of (25:06 - 25:14)
animation and movies Pokemon is doing (25:10 - 25:17)
these $4 shorts $4 shorts four minute (25:14 - 25:20)
shorts $4 shorts gets you right in I (25:17 - 25:23)
keep calling them trailers because to me (25:20 - 25:25)
they're it seems like a trailer to a (25:23 - 25:29)
movie but they're short (25:25 - 25:32)
animated it's a short animated series 18 (25:29 - 25:36)
episodes one episode a week we covered (25:32 - 25:39)
episodes one and two last week pretty in (25:36 - 25:41)
depth I was pretty happy with how that (25:39 - 25:45)
coverage turned out um as for our (25:41 - 25:48)
Giovani talk and (25:45 - 25:50)
Giovani giovan's gym being closed and (25:48 - 25:52)
then reopening (25:50 - 25:56)
giving uh Ash and Gary or blue and red (25:52 - 25:59)
um badges a lot of people tweeted or (25:56 - 26:02)
wrote in explaining that there were more (25:59 - 26:05)
than eight gyms in the cantle region and (26:02 - 26:09)
so for example Gary if I'm not mistaken (26:05 - 26:14)
in the anime had 10 badges before he (26:09 - 26:15)
challenged Giovani which would be his (26:14 - 26:21)
11th badge and another person explained (26:15 - 26:24)
that the fighting gym next to Sabrina's (26:21 - 26:27)
gym was closed and that but that used to (26:24 - 26:30)
be a gym I saw that same tweet and so I (26:27 - 26:34)
looked it up and from what the research (26:30 - 26:37)
I did it seems like the fighting Dojo (26:34 - 26:41)
competed with the that's K that's the (26:37 - 26:43)
same t as koga's gym right no the (26:41 - 26:47)
fighting Dojo was in Saffron which was (26:43 - 26:48)
Sabrina's (26:47 - 26:52)
gym yeah yeah you just said that so the (26:48 - 26:57)
what I saw said that the dojo competed (26:52 - 27:01)
with saina's gym to be the the gym for (26:57 - 27:04)
the town but always lost because of the (27:01 - 27:07)
because of the type advantage yeah cuz (27:04 - 27:11)
um was a gym what I said before was like (27:07 - 27:15)
gyms are like the Hub of the city right (27:11 - 27:16)
right so that would it wouldn't make (27:15 - 27:19)
sense for a a city to have two gyms that (27:16 - 27:21)
would be like a city having (27:19 - 27:24)
two uh two shopping malls in one town (27:21 - 27:27)
how outrageous or like two City Halls (27:24 - 27:29)
right right (27:27 - 27:33)
um the other yeah so I I I could I could (27:29 - 27:35)
subscribe to that theory that there are (27:33 - 27:38)
more than eight gyms in a region like I (27:35 - 27:40)
definitely where are they hiding though (27:38 - 27:42)
yeah that's true where where where are (27:40 - 27:45)
they where show them to me the other (27:42 - 27:47)
thing that was that was that I thought (27:45 - 27:49)
was interesting is somebody said that (27:47 - 27:52)
there was an investigator on the SSN in (27:49 - 27:55)
red and blue and that that possibly (27:52 - 27:58)
could have been looker back in the day (27:55 - 28:01)
I don't remember that too well I don't (27:58 - 28:04)
either and I can't it's there's nothing (28:01 - 28:08)
wrong with with saying that was the case (28:04 - 28:10)
it makes it more fun so yeah if it's (28:08 - 28:12)
plausible why not just decide that's (28:10 - 28:16)
what it is sure episode three is called (28:12 - 28:17)
the (28:16 - 28:20)
Challenger and it opens with a panning (28:17 - 28:23)
down to the Elite (28:20 - 28:26)
4 uh they really went overboard with the (28:23 - 28:29)
animation in this trailer I or this see (28:26 - 28:32)
I keep saying it this uh this this short (28:29 - 28:36)
but before before we move on from the (28:32 - 28:38)
the showing of The Elite 4 what are what (28:36 - 28:41)
are your thoughts uh the opening of this (28:38 - 28:44)
Oh I thought it was uh I thought it was (28:41 - 28:47)
probably one of the the Pikachu one the (28:44 - 28:50)
first one was probably the best of these (28:47 - 28:51)
I think that the (28:50 - 28:56)
Pikachu short was likely my favorite (28:51 - 28:58)
although I did like this third one (28:56 - 28:59)
better than I like the second one with (28:58 - 29:03)
looker and Giovani I thought that um I (28:59 - 29:06)
thought the battle animation was pretty (29:03 - 29:08)
although we only saw a tiny tidbit of (29:06 - 29:11)
the battles that blue does with the (29:08 - 29:15)
Elite 4 it again poses (29:11 - 29:18)
a confounding lore question in the same (29:15 - 29:20)
way that almost all of these have where (29:18 - 29:21)
you (29:20 - 29:24)
wonder given that Lance is just a member (29:21 - 29:27)
of the Elite 4 at this point Who was the (29:24 - 29:30)
champion before blue got there was it (29:27 - 29:33)
just no one what does the role of the (29:30 - 29:36)
champion signify if sometimes one of (29:33 - 29:38)
them sitting in a dark room waiting for (29:36 - 29:42)
somebody right and and and so you can (29:38 - 29:45)
kind of so at first when I was watching (29:42 - 29:48)
it with Carly might significant other (29:45 - 29:51)
weird uh she was saying wait did they as (29:48 - 29:53)
we as we were watching it she was saying (29:51 - 29:58)
wait do do they just wait there did they (29:53 - 30:01)
just stand around until someone (29:58 - 30:04)
shows and I I was like no no no no no it (30:01 - 30:08)
must just be when they're notified that (30:04 - 30:13)
someone has eight gym badges right then (30:08 - 30:17)
then they show up to me it was it was (30:13 - 30:20)
going back to like City councils or like (30:17 - 30:23)
cour houses or jurries it was like we (30:20 - 30:28)
are summoned for our duty but correct if (30:23 - 30:30)
I'm wrong but it seemed like at the end (30:28 - 30:34)
when red rolls in into the room where (30:30 - 30:37)
blue into the Champions Halls where blue (30:34 - 30:40)
is sitting that he seems surprised that (30:37 - 30:44)
red is there maybe I'm wrong I thought I (30:40 - 30:48)
thought he seemed to be expecting oh (30:44 - 30:50)
okay so then maybe that explanation is (30:48 - 30:53)
correct yeah so it it opens with all (30:50 - 30:56)
four of their doors opening and them (30:53 - 30:59)
talking about how a Challengers coming (30:56 - 31:01)
and and (30:59 - 31:04)
L'Oreal saying that you know don't worry (31:01 - 31:08)
guys you're you won't get to battle (31:04 - 31:11)
because I will stop him first uh we see (31:08 - 31:15)
L'Oreal Agatha Bruno and Lance Bruno (31:11 - 31:16)
says nothing while we while we're on (31:15 - 31:19)
that subject is did did you Noti it (31:16 - 31:21)
seems like Laura Li (31:19 - 31:26)
was depicted way more male gazy than she (31:21 - 31:29)
is in any other media am I wrong about (31:26 - 31:32)
that what do you mean by male gazy um at (31:29 - 31:34)
the risk at the risk of just putting it (31:32 - 31:36)
in such blunt terms it looked like her (31:34 - 31:38)
breasts were gigantic compared to how (31:36 - 31:42)
they're depicted like in the uh in the (31:38 - 31:46)
art for the games yeah yeah I mean in (31:42 - 31:48)
this if you were if you were to flip the (31:46 - 31:52)
coin they made Agatha real old and they (31:48 - 31:55)
really put some Line work into her face (31:52 - 31:58)
and I also think that Bruno had more ABS (31:55 - 32:01)
than humans do right I think I didn't (31:58 - 32:05)
count but I think he had like more than (32:01 - 32:07)
than a human is supposed to so there was (32:05 - 32:10)
some I think you were 100% all over the (32:07 - 32:12)
place I think you're 100% right but I I (32:10 - 32:15)
would I would I would take that further (32:12 - 32:17)
and say all four of them were definitely (32:15 - 32:19)
pushed in their respective directions to (32:17 - 32:22)
the max no one has I never thought of I (32:19 - 32:25)
never thought of laureli as this sex (32:22 - 32:27)
object so I guess that's why that one (32:25 - 32:30)
surprised me when that one surprised me (32:27 - 32:32)
more than seeing Bruno be a strong man (32:30 - 32:35)
cuz Bruno is already a strong man yeah I (32:32 - 32:37)
think it's hard to get uh a a sexy (32:35 - 32:43)
person across in in 16bit pics or sure (32:37 - 32:45)
yeah so they get together they uh they (32:43 - 32:47)
do their thing I I think it's (32:45 - 32:50)
interesting that so far in these three (32:47 - 32:53)
episodes they never say the words blue (32:50 - 32:57)
or red or Ash or Gary and of course (32:53 - 33:00)
there is is big debate and everyone gets (32:57 - 33:03)
very frustrated if you call Red Ash or (33:00 - 33:06)
if you call Gary blue or cuz clearly (33:03 - 33:08)
they're they're different people if you (33:06 - 33:10)
were to ask me I would say you're (33:08 - 33:13)
thinking too hard about it because blue (33:10 - 33:16)
and Gary literally have Professor Oak as (33:13 - 33:18)
their their grandpa so to me they're (33:16 - 33:20)
pretty much similar people they are also (33:18 - 33:22)
both jerks and they're also both cocky (33:20 - 33:25)
and they're also both very confident um (33:22 - 33:27)
and I would add into the mix the fact (33:25 - 33:29)
that the manga characters are named red (33:27 - 33:32)
and blue and those are technically (33:29 - 33:34)
different iterations and different (33:32 - 33:38)
cannons than the video games which are (33:34 - 33:41)
then different so like just even saying (33:38 - 33:44)
red or blue doesn't narrow it down to a (33:41 - 33:47)
single person anyway so why be pedantic (33:44 - 33:48)
about it they're all the same people (33:47 - 33:52)
right right I I don't know I I would (33:48 - 33:54)
love somebody to point me to the article (33:52 - 33:56)
that says like these are very different (33:54 - 33:58)
people and why it's like different (33:56 - 34:00)
versions of Batman right Batman is still (33:58 - 34:03)
Batman but the Batman you see in the the (34:00 - 34:06)
60s is different than the Batman with (34:03 - 34:08)
heat Ledger which is different than the (34:06 - 34:10)
Batman and Superman but at the end of (34:08 - 34:12)
the day it's still Batman especially (34:10 - 34:17)
considering that satosi and Ash are both (34:12 - 34:19)
alternate names when you start the (34:17 - 34:24)
game in addition to to Red so it's it's (34:19 - 34:27)
just and what is it for uh for blue what (34:24 - 34:30)
are they call is his name uh is the (34:27 - 34:32)
alternate name for blue and is Gary's (34:30 - 34:35)
name in Japanese is it I don't remember (34:32 - 34:38)
what it is I remember there's also like (34:35 - 34:40)
a third name for all of them like I (34:38 - 34:42)
think one I think red was like Allen or (34:40 - 34:45)
something yeah and regardless I (34:42 - 34:47)
understand why people like to (34:45 - 34:49)
differentiate the characters because it (34:47 - 34:51)
lets you talk about what (34:49 - 34:53)
specific (34:51 - 34:55)
character it lets you refer to a (34:53 - 34:57)
specific character and a specific (34:55 - 34:59)
interpretation of that character but to (34:57 - 35:01)
correct someone when you know exactly (34:59 - 35:03)
what they're talking about is is a (35:01 - 35:06)
little ludicrous especially considering (35:03 - 35:08)
that even saying red and blue doesn't (35:06 - 35:11)
narrow it down to manga or video game (35:08 - 35:13)
right I'm pretty sure that they're not (35:11 - 35:15)
going to use the terms red or blue or (35:13 - 35:19)
Ash and Gary just to prevent that that (35:15 - 35:22)
debate or that debacle or maybe maybe (35:19 - 35:24)
they don't care or they don't notice (35:22 - 35:26)
it's not like Pokemon it's not like tcpi (35:24 - 35:28)
came out and said this is specifically (35:26 - 35:30)
this person this is specifically this (35:28 - 35:35)
person but who's to say that that the (35:30 - 35:37)
red character isn't something that's (35:35 - 35:39)
supposed to represent you still I think (35:37 - 35:42)
even if you were to name if I was to go (35:39 - 35:44)
through red and blue and I name myself (35:42 - 35:46)
Steve and I name my rival (35:44 - 35:49)
Travis even if even when I'm playing the (35:46 - 35:52)
Travis character is still cocky is still (35:49 - 35:54)
confident is still just like me in real (35:52 - 35:58)
life and confident I wish wish I was (35:54 - 36:01)
confident so it does still kind of fit (35:58 - 36:03)
this like mold of your rival is this (36:01 - 36:06)
personality which is what uh they show (36:03 - 36:10)
in the The Challenger episode so we get (36:06 - 36:12)
this pan around of all four of them (36:10 - 36:13)
meeting walking together pretty much (36:12 - 36:17)
getting ready we go through eight doors (36:13 - 36:20)
uh and we see we see the Challenger walk (36:17 - 36:21)
up which in this terms I'll just use the (36:20 - 36:25)
word blue because why not uh pushes (36:21 - 36:28)
through the door we see is it laurelai I (36:25 - 36:31)
always thought it was Laur Laur now I (36:28 - 36:32)
can't even remember I think it's (36:31 - 36:35)
laurelai lauriel uh because I was always (36:32 - 36:37)
thinking of the hair (36:35 - 36:40)
shampoo this is the the first battle (36:37 - 36:42)
between the two of them is is probably (36:40 - 36:44)
like the longest and the coolest we see (36:42 - 36:46)
an Alakazam versus a Lapras I think the (36:44 - 36:50)
animation is great I think from we see (36:46 - 36:51)
the first time from like lapis's (36:50 - 36:53)
perspective of like looking around (36:51 - 36:55)
trying to figure out where Alakazam is (36:53 - 36:58)
and then Alakazam sliming Lapras into (36:55 - 37:02)
the ground and uh a lot of showboating (36:58 - 37:06)
and a lot of like I I like the The Jerk (37:02 - 37:11)
rival a lot yeah yeah the animations (37:06 - 37:12)
characterize him better than the (37:11 - 37:14)
dialogue I think right oh yeah the (37:12 - 37:15)
dialogue is super corny I'm like (37:14 - 37:17)
replaying it without the (37:15 - 37:20)
dialogue I think this is this is (37:17 - 37:24)
something you see obviously in in (37:20 - 37:28)
wrestling uh where you see a quote (37:24 - 37:32)
unquote bad guy or a heel and they're (37:28 - 37:35)
just over overly cocky they're (37:32 - 37:38)
showboating they think they're (37:35 - 37:41)
unbeatable they're bad winners and we (37:38 - 37:43)
see that with blue where he pretty much (37:41 - 37:46)
insults them on his way into the next (37:43 - 37:48)
room I think that makes the good guy (37:46 - 37:53)
winning or your character uh just more (37:48 - 37:55)
satisfying and they they definitely set (37:53 - 37:58)
that up in the video games they they're (37:55 - 38:00)
they're showing that experience here in (37:58 - 38:03)
episode 3 that is just just like a Trope (38:00 - 38:06)
they use in other forms of media like (38:03 - 38:09)
like I said wrestling like the if the (38:06 - 38:13)
heel or the bad guy has a title and they (38:09 - 38:16)
keep winning it's more satisfying when (38:13 - 38:19)
you can finally take that away from them (38:16 - 38:21)
right I don't think Bruno says anything (38:19 - 38:25)
the entire time I don't remember he (38:21 - 38:26)
doesn't say anything at the very (38:25 - 38:27)
beginning oh he doesn't does say (38:26 - 38:28)
anything at the beginning but he does he (38:27 - 38:31)
does say something when blue walks in uh (38:28 - 38:34)
we see Machamp verse I'm waiting for him (38:31 - 38:38)
to throw out pidot I'm not a fan of I've (38:34 - 38:41)
never been a fan of in any of the anime (38:38 - 38:44)
or the movies a Pokemon slamming into (38:41 - 38:46)
their trainer slamming into a wall (38:44 - 38:49)
putting a hole in the wall that's where (38:46 - 38:51)
you draw the line yeah why because it's (38:49 - 38:54)
ridiculous or just because it's it's (38:51 - 38:56)
overused why I think a little uh a (38:54 - 38:59)
little little column a little column B (38:56 - 39:03)
sure I mean I can't argue there I I I (38:59 - 39:06)
just I guess I don't have that specific (39:03 - 39:09)
hatred towards that very hyper specific (39:06 - 39:11)
Motif but I guess now that you say it it (39:09 - 39:13)
does happen a lot I think it I think it (39:11 - 39:17)
definitely shows that Bruno is a brick (39:13 - 39:21)
house and didn't Flinch at all when he (39:17 - 39:23)
got slammed into the wall but Machamp (39:21 - 39:24)
went (39:23 - 39:27)
down very quickly this is also the (39:24 - 39:29)
second time we've seen Machamp in three (39:27 - 39:33)
episodes true I also the second time (39:29 - 39:35)
we've seen a Machamp did go through the (39:33 - 39:37)
wall this time or no he didn't go (39:35 - 39:39)
through he just (39:37 - 39:42)
slammed they should exchange notes on uh (39:39 - 39:45)
wall breaking techniques yeah why why is (39:42 - 39:47)
that one in the Elite 4 we we saw some (39:45 - 39:50)
more impressive stuff from the episode (39:47 - 39:51)
TW ma (39:50 - 39:54)
champ I think Bruno needs to set up a (39:51 - 39:57)
trade uh we open with Agatha's Battle of (39:54 - 40:00)
ryhorn being on all four which I think (39:57 - 40:03)
is interesting I think it's I love (40:00 - 40:06)
seeing that perspective of ryhorn on all (40:03 - 40:09)
four because you see you see the (40:06 - 40:12)
salamander in him you see the lizard (40:09 - 40:15)
form of ryhorn except obviously he's all (40:12 - 40:18)
rock and I think that's we don't see (40:15 - 40:20)
that often we see just ryhorn on two (40:18 - 40:24)
legs in its in its standard sprite (40:20 - 40:28)
animation ryhorn taking down an AR (40:24 - 40:33)
Agatha is Agatha is the most interesting (40:28 - 40:36)
character with the same amount of screen (40:33 - 40:40)
time and the same amount of what's the (40:36 - 40:42)
word it's not like they focus on any of (40:40 - 40:44)
the elite for characters more than (40:42 - 40:49)
others MH and I think just with Agatha's (40:44 - 40:51)
Pokemon and Agatha's presence and (40:49 - 40:53)
especially in in this (40:51 - 40:56)
episode you can just tell that Agatha (40:53 - 40:59)
has the most character in low behind her (40:56 - 41:01)
yeah she's she's interesting and just (40:59 - 41:05)
the fact that she's an old woman is (41:01 - 41:08)
cool she has a cane a staff and uh (41:05 - 41:11)
Pokeball is embedded in the top and she (41:08 - 41:14)
opens that up for her last Pokemon and (41:11 - 41:18)
the way that Gengar pours out of it is (41:14 - 41:21)
something I would have never thought in (41:18 - 41:24)
the 20 years of Pokemon to like happen (41:21 - 41:27)
like every Pokeball has been thrown (41:24 - 41:30)
uh thrown and open and then returned and (41:27 - 41:32)
how she nothing new Under the Pokemon (41:30 - 41:36)
Sun version and just seeing Gengar pour (41:32 - 41:39)
out into the Shadow and then morph up is (41:36 - 41:42)
just amazing uh we don't see that battle (41:39 - 41:43)
though we just see Gengar stick his (41:42 - 41:46)
tongue out and then we go on to Lance (41:43 - 41:48)
Lance is your (41:46 - 41:51)
stereotypical uh I'm the leader for no (41:48 - 41:53)
good generic reason except I have dragon (41:51 - 41:56)
Pokemon and there's only Dragonite line (41:53 - 41:58)
is is the only dragons you're going to (41:56 - 42:00)
get hate for that a lot of a lot of (41:58 - 42:01)
people love Lance I'm not one of them (42:00 - 42:03)
but a lot of people a lot of people say (42:01 - 42:07)
Lance is their favorite uh favorite (42:03 - 42:10)
Champion Lance is the champion in the (42:07 - 42:11)
wrong (42:10 - 42:13)
generation he is the champion in a (42:11 - 42:15)
generation where Dragon Knight is the (42:13 - 42:18)
only good Dragon line wa no no no no no (42:15 - 42:22)
he's not champion in gen one blue right (42:18 - 42:24)
he's champion in gen (42:22 - 42:27)
two but doesn't he still get King kingra (42:24 - 42:29)
I guess I think he still has two (42:27 - 42:31)
Dragonites right he still has two (42:29 - 42:33)
Dragonites that's my problem with Lance (42:31 - 42:35)
is let me let me pull up his team just (42:33 - 42:38)
so we're right I'm pretty sure in red (42:35 - 42:41)
and blue he has two (42:38 - 42:45)
Dragonites one Dragon Aire an Aerodactyl (42:41 - 42:48)
and a Gyarados that is what I'm pretty (42:45 - 42:53)
sure he has his team in red and blue is (42:48 - 42:58)
gados Dragon Aire dragonir Aerodactyl (42:53 - 43:00)
Dragonite he he doesn't even have two (42:58 - 43:03)
Dragonites he has two dragon air oh my (43:00 - 43:04)
gosh and then a (43:03 - 43:07)
yellow yellow it's the same so I don't (43:04 - 43:08)
know why they list it twice oh maybe the (43:07 - 43:10)
moves change or something probably yeah (43:08 - 43:12)
they do there's a difference in move set (43:10 - 43:15)
then in Gold Silver and (43:12 - 43:18)
Crystal (43:15 - 43:18)
he so the thing about gold silver and (43:19 - 43:23)
Crystal is that it adds kja right it (43:22 - 43:25)
adds another Dragon for him to play (43:23 - 43:29)
around with except now his team is and (43:25 - 43:31)
this is this is out of order just for (43:29 - 43:33)
the sake of the joke his team is (43:31 - 43:38)
Gyarados Charizard Aerodactyl Dragonite (43:33 - 43:42)
Dragonite Dragonite perfect what a team (43:38 - 43:44)
it's in gold and silver that he has (43:42 - 43:46)
multiple Dragonites and it's (43:44 - 43:49)
three and no (43:46 - 43:52)
kingra correct that that that right (43:49 - 43:55)
there is my core problem with Lance yeah (43:52 - 43:57)
you're not even going (43:55 - 44:00)
apparently it takes till um the rematch (43:57 - 44:03)
in fire rod and leaf green for him to (44:00 - 44:07)
finally get on the KRA train uh the the (44:03 - 44:10)
episode does make Dragonite look a (44:07 - 44:11)
little (44:10 - 44:15)
intimidating blue throws out (44:11 - 44:18)
Blastoise we don't we don't see a battle (44:15 - 44:21)
here I mean we we see two moves go at (44:18 - 44:24)
each other in a bunch of smoke and the (44:21 - 44:28)
rest is up to our imagination (44:24 - 44:32)
the unsatisfying ending happens of Blues (44:28 - 44:35)
sitting in the dark in the champion (44:32 - 44:38)
Arena looking at a Pokeball waiting for (44:35 - 44:45)
ash SL red/ whoever SL you yeah I think (44:38 - 44:48)
the ending does more harm than good in (44:45 - 44:52)
what way it OB it obviously strikes the (44:48 - 44:55)
it strikes the the memory in you of (44:52 - 44:57)
remembering your first time getting to (44:55 - 45:00)
the champion spot at the Elite 4 right (44:57 - 45:02)
of I finally beat the Elite 4 okay (45:00 - 45:05)
there's more there's more there's more (45:02 - 45:07)
and it does it does at least strike with (45:05 - 45:10)
me that that challenge of like I (45:07 - 45:12)
remember the first time I beat Lance (45:10 - 45:15)
after you know countless hours and tries (45:12 - 45:18)
and feeling so good once I beat Lance (45:15 - 45:20)
and then knowing that there was not (45:18 - 45:23)
knowing that there was another fight and (45:20 - 45:25)
that I only had like one Pokemon left at (45:23 - 45:29)
like 2 Hp and then being like broken in (45:25 - 45:33)
half to start over again MH and I think (45:29 - 45:37)
that's what it's hitting at but in the (45:33 - 45:39)
and I think it hits that very (45:37 - 45:43)
well in the aspect of the lore and just (45:39 - 45:47)
the Pokemon Universe I think it fails at (45:43 - 45:50)
accomplishing or providing the viewer (45:47 - 45:53)
what the champion Champion's role is in (45:50 - 45:54)
the Pokemon (45:53 - 45:57)
Universe like we I would would concur (45:54 - 46:00)
like I said it's the fact that there (45:57 - 46:03)
presumably is no champion before Blue (46:00 - 46:06)
Beats the Elite 4 begs the question what (46:03 - 46:08)
is the role of the champion then because (46:06 - 46:10)
we don't see and why isn't Lance just (46:08 - 46:11)
the champion and they get some other (46:10 - 46:13)
chump to be the fourth Elite Four like (46:11 - 46:14)
why couldn't they just do that is it (46:13 - 46:17)
that no one in the Elite 4 can defeat (46:14 - 46:20)
the other three members or or how like (46:17 - 46:23)
how does it it the and it's the same (46:20 - 46:25)
with all of these shorts they beg a lot (46:23 - 46:27)
more questions than they answer and it (46:25 - 46:30)
it just becomes frustrating obvious I I (46:27 - 46:32)
don't ever imagine the Elite 4 just (46:30 - 46:34)
sitting in their rooms waiting for (46:32 - 46:38)
people I would I always imagine that you (46:34 - 46:43)
know somebody goes through the gates to (46:38 - 46:47)
the Elite 4 and they register for a (46:43 - 46:50)
challenging the Elite 4 and then the (46:47 - 46:52)
Elite 4 get together for the challenge (46:50 - 46:54)
they get they get an email they they get (46:52 - 46:56)
a text on their phone like letting them (46:54 - 46:58)
know at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow they got to (46:56 - 47:01)
battle some chump you've got until some (46:58 - 47:03)
Trump makes it through victory road to (47:01 - 47:06)
get your stupid butts up to the Indigo (47:03 - 47:09)
Plateau right right right like that is (47:06 - 47:12)
their job though I am sure besides the (47:09 - 47:15)
four of them battling people who have (47:12 - 47:18)
eight plus gym badges I am sure they do (47:15 - 47:22)
something in the Pokemon world or their (47:18 - 47:25)
region just like how a gym leader is (47:22 - 47:27)
supposed to help run the (47:25 - 47:31)
town so when a champion comes and (47:27 - 47:32)
becomes (47:31 - 47:34)
Champion one would assume they have to (47:32 - 47:37)
defend that (47:34 - 47:40)
Championship then one would assume they (47:37 - 47:43)
have some other (47:40 - 47:48)
Ro I it's just hard to imagine being the (47:43 - 47:50)
best and being (47:48 - 47:55)
champion and then not knowing what that (47:50 - 47:57)
entails but decides (47:55 - 47:59)
defending maybe that's maybe that's (47:57 - 48:00)
enough you're not you're not going to (47:59 - 48:02)
get an answer from me cuz I'm just as (48:00 - 48:04)
confused as you are and I'm sure we'll (48:02 - 48:07)
get and I'll preempt this I'm sure we'll (48:04 - 48:09)
get tweets with people that provide some (48:07 - 48:11)
explanations but regardless of whether (48:09 - 48:13)
or not you can come up with an (48:11 - 48:16)
explanation I think it's fair to say (48:13 - 48:18)
that the EXP in the same way that the (48:16 - 48:21)
explanations we got for so what's going (48:18 - 48:23)
on in vidiian City when giovan is not (48:21 - 48:27)
hanging out that those explanations are (48:23 - 48:29)
referring to very specific events in the (48:27 - 48:32)
anime like seeing Gary have 10 badges (48:29 - 48:33)
that don't that don't really have an (48:32 - 48:36)
explanation that that again answer more (48:33 - 48:37)
or ask more questions than they answer (48:36 - 48:40)
because hey where are those other three (48:37 - 48:42)
towns or (48:40 - 48:44)
whatever that most of the explanations (48:42 - 48:47)
you can find for these things beg a lot (48:44 - 48:50)
more questions and it just proves that (48:47 - 48:52)
while those things are satisfying in the (48:50 - 48:55)
game and to some extent the anime when (48:52 - 48:56)
the (48:55 - 49:00)
actual functioning of the society is (48:56 - 49:04)
secondary to the content it's it seems (49:00 - 49:06)
like these shorts are attempting to (49:04 - 49:11)
flesh out the Pokemon world and and show (49:06 - 49:14)
the the workings of them if the second (49:11 - 49:17)
short is any indication and so it's (49:14 - 49:19)
frustrating to me at least when their (49:17 - 49:23)
attempts to do that just make me more (49:19 - 49:26)
confused I couldn't say it better myself (49:23 - 49:28)
I I I (49:26 - 49:30)
enjoyed while we're being (49:28 - 49:32)
critical that's not to say I didn't (49:30 - 49:35)
enjoy my 5 minutes watching it yeah I (49:32 - 49:38)
thought this one was all right I mean I (49:35 - 49:41)
I think I think you like these you've (49:38 - 49:45)
been liking these more than I have yeah (49:41 - 49:48)
probably yeah no I I I liked him I liked (49:45 - 49:50)
out of all the people in the Pokemon (49:48 - 49:52)
world I think the gym leaders and the (49:50 - 49:55)
Elite 4 are are the most interesting (49:52 - 49:58)
because they they seem to stay stagnant (49:55 - 50:01)
with with the history of the towns they (49:58 - 50:03)
reside in and the regions they reside in (50:01 - 50:05)
I'm more interested in the name (50:03 - 50:10)
Raider what's the name Raider's (50:05 - 50:10)
deal maybe they'll they'll uncover that (50:11 - 50:18)
is that all you do and also how can you (50:14 - 50:20)
tell that I traded a Pokemon away and (50:18 - 50:23)
why does that make or how can you tell (50:20 - 50:25)
that a Pokemon I'm asking you to rate is (50:23 - 50:27)
a traded Pokemon and why does that (50:25 - 50:29)
automatically make its name the greatest (50:27 - 50:31)
on the (50:29 - 50:36)
planet I there's so many questions I uh (50:31 - 50:38)
I'm assuming that next week we won't be (50:36 - 50:41)
talking about the Kanto region anymore I (50:38 - 50:43)
feel like now that we've seen the Kanto (50:41 - 50:46)
Elite 4 it would be weird to go back I (50:43 - 50:48)
bet you're right I'm sure we'll see (50:46 - 50:50)
Johto they have to pretty much cover six (50:48 - 50:54)
Generations in 18 episodes so while (50:50 - 50:56)
there while there will be crossover I'm (50:54 - 50:58)
I'm like like looker for example I'm (50:56 - 51:00)
sure that there are other stories to (50:58 - 51:03)
tell and actually that's more exciting (51:00 - 51:06)
to me because if if anything I feel like (51:03 - 51:09)
I am a pretty big expert on red and blue (51:06 - 51:10)
just (51:09 - 51:14)
because that is probably that was my (51:10 - 51:16)
entire childhood and that's why I (51:14 - 51:18)
remember all the gyms and all the gym (51:16 - 51:23)
leaders and I have the memories of like (51:18 - 51:26)
in like Lavender Town and Cubone and the (51:23 - 51:29)
Elite 4 and discovering Articuno and the (51:26 - 51:31)
first time in the power plant like I (51:29 - 51:35)
remember all those so vividly and yeah (51:31 - 51:37)
so I I'm I'm I'm very curious to see if (51:35 - 51:40)
if the remaining episodes can also (51:37 - 51:44)
trigger uh those memories in me but (51:40 - 51:46)
we're going to trigger a break and when (51:44 - 51:48)
we come back we're going to talk about (51:46 - 51:50)
some new Pokemon we only have uh four to (51:48 - 51:52)

and we are back from our break this last (53:03 - 53:12)
week uh actually on September 20th (53:09 - 53:14)
Pokemon company revealed some new (53:12 - 53:17)
Pokemon because they haven't done that (53:14 - 53:20)
in the past we've barely seen for them (53:17 - 53:23)
any new Pokemon of sun and moon it's not (53:20 - 53:24)
like we're going to have the whole (53:23 - 53:28)
Pokedex shown to us (53:24 - 53:30)
prior uh so these are exclusive Pokemon (53:28 - 53:32)
to each generation to each version (53:30 - 53:36)
rather let's dive in here paman pamine (53:32 - 53:39)
piman piman that sounds right fighting (53:36 - 53:42)
type pokon Simon refers to I'm not an (53:39 - 53:45)
expert on biology but some sort of some (53:42 - 53:49)
sort of uh monkey or ape and then pass (53:45 - 53:54)
is like pass because it's a a a a a (53:49 - 53:54)
sportman uh the teamwork Pokemon how do (53:54 - 54:03)
you say it P I think it's piman p piman (53:58 - 54:06)
attack by throwing berries at their foes (54:03 - 54:08)
they tend to live in troops of 20 to 30 (54:06 - 54:11)
who all follow one leader these tribes (54:08 - 54:14)
and teams work to train and improve (54:11 - 54:16)
their skills this Pokemon has the (54:14 - 54:19)
ability receiver an ability which no (54:16 - 54:23)
previous Pokemon has had receiver uh can (54:19 - 54:27)
inherit an ability of an Ally Who faints (54:23 - 54:29)
in battle this Pokemon will only appear (54:27 - 54:33)
in the sun version uh that's cool I (54:29 - 54:35)
guess right that seems like this Pokemon (54:33 - 54:38)
is set up for doubles clearly it is and (54:35 - 54:41)
I've been trying to think of what (54:38 - 54:44)
situation you would you could really (54:41 - 54:47)
take advantage of but then it's like if (54:44 - 54:49)
you're already getting an extremely if (54:47 - 54:50)
you're already using a Pokemon with an (54:49 - 54:53)
extremely powerful ability just use two (54:50 - 54:56)
Pokemon with that ability I I don't know (54:53 - 54:57)
I mean maybe we'll find out the pmans (54:56 - 54:59)
based stats are very good so you would (54:57 - 55:02)
want to pass on a good ability to it but (54:59 - 55:05)
isn't there a legendary Pokemon that has (55:02 - 55:07)
amazing abilities I can't think there's (55:05 - 55:08)
some there's some legendaries that have (55:07 - 55:10)
good abilities I mean I guess shadja (55:08 - 55:12)
comes to mind with Wonder guard so if if (55:10 - 55:15)
you're if you can get (55:12 - 55:19)
shadja okay okay now I get it so you you (55:15 - 55:23)
put a life orb on shinja shinja uses so (55:19 - 55:27)
shinja is should Shedinja has the (55:23 - 55:30)
ability Wonder guard Wonder Guard works (55:27 - 55:34)
where you only take damage if a move is (55:30 - 55:36)
super effective because of that very (55:34 - 55:38)
very strong ability Shedinja only has (55:36 - 55:42)
one HP typically people run shinja with (55:38 - 55:45)
Focus sash so that it takes Dam super (55:42 - 55:47)
effective damage Focus sash triggers and (55:45 - 55:50)
you get one more chance at being hit (55:47 - 55:52)
before shinja dies but you could run (55:50 - 55:54)
shinja with something that's meant to (55:52 - 55:56)
kill it like a life orb so it deals (55:54 - 55:59)
damage and then life orb triggers so you (55:56 - 56:01)
deal a little bit more damage but then (55:59 - 56:03)
you take the one HP of damage forcing (56:01 - 56:05)
shadin to faint you then (56:03 - 56:09)
transfer that ability to piman which is (56:05 - 56:11)
a Pokemon that has more than one HP and (56:09 - 56:13)
now has Wonder guard and maybe that's (56:11 - 56:17)
cool I guess fighting has a decent (56:13 - 56:18)
amount of weaknesses which piman is (56:17 - 56:21)
fighting type but you know I can think (56:18 - 56:23)
of strange situations like that that are (56:21 - 56:25)
sort of gimmicky but I can't think of (56:23 - 56:27)
any (56:25 - 56:30)
solid foolproof strategies at the moment (56:27 - 56:31)
maybe one will come up though next (56:30 - 56:36)
Pokemon is Aang Guru Aang Guru yeah like (56:31 - 56:38)
Aang Aang and Guru I think you're saying (56:36 - 56:41)
it correctly a normal psychic Pokemon (56:38 - 56:43)
I'm going to try to think of any other (56:41 - 56:45)
normal psychic type Pokemon as I read (56:43 - 56:47)
this but I'm not sure of any off the top (56:45 - 56:50)
of my head the sage Pokemon Oren Guru (56:47 - 56:53)
lives in the solitary deeps of the (56:50 - 56:55)
alolan forest and in fact where once (56:53 - 56:58)
known as the people of the forest (56:55 - 57:02)
oranguru hold a fan-like object made of (56:58 - 57:06)
leaves that are known to be kind to (57:02 - 57:08)
other Pokemon in the forest often giving (57:06 - 57:10)
injured Pokemon medicine or hungry (57:08 - 57:14)
Pokemon food this Pokemon can learn this (57:10 - 57:17)
Pokemon can exclusively learn a new move (57:14 - 57:20)
instruct a move which makes the selected (57:17 - 57:23)
Target use the most recent move (57:20 - 57:26)
immediately again uh this Pokemon only (57:23 - 57:29)
appears in Pokemon Moon I think that is (57:26 - 57:31)
more interesting to me that in that I (57:29 - 57:33)
think instruct is more interesting to me (57:31 - 57:36)
than Pan's (57:33 - 57:38)
ability receiver and I realize that (57:36 - 57:39)
instruct is a move and and receiver is (57:38 - 57:40)
an (57:39 - 57:44)
ability but or whatever Pan's ability is (57:40 - 57:45)
called you're right the interesting (57:44 - 57:47)
thing about (57:45 - 57:52)
instruct is that if on Guru has base (57:47 - 57:55)
stats that and you would think it would (57:52 - 57:58)
given its two given its ability and its (57:55 - 58:00)
signature move the ability telepathy (57:58 - 58:01)
which makes it so that it can't take (58:00 - 58:06)
damage from Partners moves and instruct (58:01 - 58:09)
which is only useful in doubles that (58:06 - 58:12)
hopefully Oran Guru would have the move (58:09 - 58:15)
pool and base stats to be a support (58:12 - 58:18)
Pokemon as sometimes Pokemon like (58:15 - 58:21)
Cresselia act in doubles because helping (58:18 - 58:26)
hand is already a move people use where (58:21 - 58:29)
it increases the base power of your (58:26 - 58:32)
allies move and it has to be adjacent (58:29 - 58:35)
for for triple or for triple battles (58:32 - 58:37)
that's kind of relevant um your adjacent (58:35 - 58:40)
allies move by 50% and that already gets (58:37 - 58:43)
used because it's nice having a a (58:40 - 58:47)
Pokemon that has enough HP and defenses (58:43 - 58:51)
to survive a long time even if it's only (58:47 - 58:53)
outputting half of the damage as its (58:51 - 58:56)
opponent but with inst struck F every (58:53 - 58:57)
turn you're (58:56 - 59:02)
dealing TW your your or Guru or Guru is (58:57 - 59:06)
outputting exactly 100% of the damage (59:02 - 59:09)
output as of its first attack and if (59:06 - 59:11)
people already are using helping hand in (59:09 - 59:14)
doubles which sometimes they Doh that (59:11 - 59:16)
instruct must be pretty dang (59:14 - 59:19)
good assuming Oran Guru has the Bas (59:16 - 59:23)
stats and move pool other than instruct (59:19 - 59:25)
to make it work right like if all orang (59:23 - 59:26)
Guru has other than instruct are (59:25 - 59:28)
damaging moves then that would make it (59:26 - 59:31)
difficult or if it had extremely high (59:28 - 59:33)
offenses which it doesn't seem likely (59:31 - 59:35)
but you know if if either of those two (59:33 - 59:37)
things are true then it doesn't work out (59:35 - 59:39)
but it could be interesting in in a (59:37 - 59:41)
double battle environment if that is (59:39 - 59:44)
true yeah both these Pokemon are clearly (59:41 - 59:46)
set up for double right the previously (59:44 - 59:49)
shown puppy Pokemon rockruff can evolve (59:46 - 59:52)
into a different form def depending (59:49 - 59:53)
whether you're playing Pokemon sun or (59:52 - 59:58)
Pokemon Moon like canrock lyen rock lyen (59:53 - 60:01)
Ro lyen Rock Lykan I don't actually know (59:58 - 60:03)
if it's like Latin or Greek or whatever (60:01 - 60:06)
but it has some relationship it's some (60:03 - 60:08)
word that has a relationship to wolves (60:06 - 60:11)
which is why the often we wolves are (60:08 - 60:13)
referred to as lyans in various media (60:11 - 60:17)
because lyan is a word that refers to (60:13 - 60:19)
wolves and then rock is like rock (60:17 - 60:21)
because it's rock type right it's just (60:19 - 60:24)
no K on that rock right which I believe (60:21 - 60:26)
was I believe this name was different (60:24 - 60:28)
than what we talked about last week I (60:26 - 60:29)
think we got the Japanese name last week (60:28 - 60:31)
because I remember it not being as easy (60:29 - 60:35)
to say the we have midday form and (60:31 - 60:38)
midnight form the first one being in (60:35 - 60:43)
Pokemon Sun rockruff is bath in profuse (60:38 - 60:46)
amounts of solar energy and so galo's (60:43 - 60:48)
influence causes this Pokemon to evolve (60:46 - 60:51)
into lyan rocks midday form this form is (60:48 - 60:54)
known for Speedy movement which can conf (60:51 - 60:57)
confound its opponents it's a very loyal (60:54 - 61:00)
Pokemon lyen Rock's midday form Dodges (60:57 - 61:02)
opponent's strike whilst attacking with (61:00 - 61:05)
sharp rocks on its main lyan Rock's (61:02 - 61:08)
midday form can learn a cell Rock a new (61:05 - 61:11)
move unique to this Pokemon which is (61:08 - 61:13)
guaranteed to strike first damaging its (61:11 - 61:17)
opponent by slaming them very quickly uh (61:13 - 61:20)
this sounds like a Aqua Jet or a sucker (61:17 - 61:25)
punch increased priority yep uh the (61:20 - 61:26)
midnight form here in the world of (61:25 - 61:30)
Pokémon moon rockruff is bathed in an (61:26 - 61:33)
abundance of lunar energy and lunala's (61:30 - 61:35)
influence causes this Pokemon to evolve (61:33 - 61:38)
into lyen Rock's midnight form this (61:35 - 61:41)
Pokemon will sacrifice its own safety to (61:38 - 61:43)
strike down its foes the stronger the (61:41 - 61:47)
opponent is the more excited lyen Rock's (61:43 - 61:49)
midnight form becomes its eyes glowing (61:47 - 61:52)
with the thrill of battle this Pokemon (61:49 - 61:57)
feels a deep lust a deep thrust thrust (61:52 - 62:00)
trust lust thrust this Pokemon deals (61:57 - 62:03)
feels a deep thrust towards a trainer (62:00 - 62:07)
who can draw forth its true power did we (62:03 - 62:10)
say that did we say that the midnight (62:07 - 62:12)
form gets the ability inner Focus which (62:10 - 62:14)
is an ability that prevents flinching (62:12 - 62:18)
and the midday form gets is it sand Rush (62:14 - 62:21)
which is an ability that doubles your (62:18 - 62:24)
speed when under Sandstorm conditions uh (62:21 - 62:26)
no we didn't say that my press my press (62:24 - 62:29)
release here from tcpi does not mention (62:26 - 62:32)
abilities oh well uh that's that's what (62:29 - 62:33)
it (62:32 - 62:37)
gets surprise oh apparently oh the I (62:33 - 62:39)
apparently both can also get Keen ey oh (62:37 - 62:41)
no it doesn't get Inner focus it get (62:39 - 62:43)
vital spirit I was incorrect sorry I'll (62:41 - 62:47)
start that all over again the midday (62:43 - 62:50)
form gets either the abilities Keen ey (62:47 - 62:54)
or sand Rush Keen ey is an ability that (62:50 - 62:58)
prevents loss of accuracy from moves (62:54 - 63:01)
like sand attack or something and then (62:58 - 63:02)
sand (63:01 - 63:08)
Rush is an ability that doubles the (63:02 - 63:12)
speed of um sand Rush is an ability that (63:08 - 63:14)
doubles the speed of a Pokemon when (63:12 - 63:16)
under the effects of (63:14 - 63:20)
Sandstorm and then vital spirit is the (63:16 - 63:23)
so then the midnight form can get two (63:20 - 63:26)
abilities Keen Eye the same as the (63:23 - 63:29)
midday form and then vital Spirit which (63:26 - 63:34)
is an ability that prevents being put to (63:29 - 63:36)
sleep uh two new Pokemon specific Z (63:34 - 63:38)
moves were also shown for some fan (63:36 - 63:40)
favorite Pokemon it says fan favorite in (63:38 - 63:44)
Pro release Pikachu exclusive zmo move (63:40 - 63:47)
named c c (63:44 - 63:51)
catastro Pika catastropika yeah H I got (63:47 - 63:54)
there eventually Pikachu's exclusive Z (63:51 - 63:56)
move is superpowered attack where (63:54 - 63:58)
Pikachu borrows its trainer strength W (63:56 - 64:02)
it wraps itself in high voltage electric (63:58 - 64:04)
power then charges into its opponent (64:02 - 64:07)
this is Pikachu's most powerful attack (64:04 - 64:10)
Eve's exclusive Z move is Extreme Evo (64:07 - 64:14)
boost E's exclusive Z move uh gathers (64:10 - 64:18)
together Sylveon jolon and (64:14 - 64:22)
more jolon watch jolon has been (64:18 - 64:26)
found uh all of the eight Pokemon that (64:22 - 64:29)
Eevee can evolve into will grant Powers (64:26 - 64:32)
Eevee the highly powerful move raises (64:29 - 64:35)
E's attack defense special attack (64:32 - 64:39)
special defense and speed by two Z move (64:35 - 64:42)
aside I think this confirms there are no (64:39 - 64:44)
new EV Evolutions true because there (64:42 - 64:47)
were no other EV Evolutions in the (64:44 - 64:51)
animation I I I wasn't expecting there (64:47 - 64:54)
to be one and as some people pointed out (64:51 - 64:55)
in (64:54 - 64:58)
discussions that included the Pokemon (64:55 - 65:00)
podcast account on Twitter someone point (64:58 - 65:01)
I apologize that I don't have this (65:00 - 65:02)
person's name but someone pointed out (65:01 - 65:05)
that typically you get typically you get (65:02 - 65:07)
new EV (65:05 - 65:09)
Evolutions (65:07 - 65:12)
in odd Generations is that what they (65:09 - 65:16)
said maybe not no no cuz it's even yeah (65:12 - 65:19)
yeah yeah it's gen 7 so you get new e (65:16 - 65:22)
Evolutions in even Generations which I (65:19 - 65:24)
think is true because you got new EVS in (65:22 - 65:29)
gen two gen 4 and gen six that is a (65:24 - 65:31)
great find three more little bullet (65:29 - 65:33)
points here the popular I just want to (65:31 - 65:35)
say I love the animations for both of (65:33 - 65:38)
those Z moves they're really cool and (65:35 - 65:41)
I'm curious if the Pokemon keep their Z (65:38 - 65:44)
move when they evolve because if that's (65:41 - 65:46)
true holy cow Eevee Z move is going to (65:44 - 65:49)
be exceptional on some of its Evolutions (65:46 - 65:53)
because you think how powerful xerus is (65:49 - 65:55)
geomancy is (65:53 - 65:57)
which is a move that does essentially (65:55 - 65:59)
the same thing but takes two turns to do (65:57 - 66:02)
it unless you have uh the right item for (65:59 - 66:04)
it and it doesn't increase all of your (66:02 - 66:05)
stats (66:04 - 66:09)
sharply holy cow that Z move could could (66:05 - 66:13)
do a lot there you go the popular (66:09 - 66:15)
character customization feature makes a (66:13 - 66:17)
return I like how they say popular like (66:15 - 66:20)
they knew what they were dealing with (66:17 - 66:22)
personalize your character's clothing (66:20 - 66:24)
hairstyle eye color as you venture (66:22 - 66:26)
through through the alola region now you (66:24 - 66:28)
can even dye your Fashions to change (66:26 - 66:30)
their color and make sure you pull off (66:28 - 66:34)
your favorite look while out (66:30 - 66:36)
adventuring I think this is I think it's (66:34 - 66:37)
interesting that you can dye your (66:36 - 66:39)
clothes I remember when they showed the (66:37 - 66:42)
first uh trailer of the the character (66:39 - 66:45)
walking and I provided screenshots of uh (66:42 - 66:49)
their pants being the same pants but the (66:45 - 66:51)
pockets being red in one and the pockets (66:49 - 66:53)
being gray in the other and their shirts (66:51 - 66:56)
were different same shirt except one was (66:53 - 66:58)
blue striped I think and one was gray (66:56 - 67:00)
striped and I remember tweeting those (66:58 - 67:01)
from the Pokemon podcast account and (67:00 - 67:04)
them getting uh probably some of the (67:01 - 67:05)
most retweets we've ever (67:04 - 67:08)
done because I at that point was like (67:05 - 67:10)
character this was before they confirmed (67:08 - 67:12)
character customization and I was like (67:10 - 67:15)
this this right here proves character (67:12 - 67:17)
customization and I remember somebody (67:15 - 67:21)
tweeting back and going no they this (67:17 - 67:24)
doesn't confirm it at all like they're (67:21 - 67:28)
they probably just didn't didn't color (67:24 - 67:31)
correct the the the the two different (67:28 - 67:33)
parts in the (67:31 - 67:35)
trailer and I thought to (67:33 - 67:40)
myself these trailers are very specific (67:35 - 67:43)
and designed to show us very specific (67:40 - 67:46)
things they that wasn't they're not put (67:43 - 67:49)
together by an intern which was like (67:46 - 67:51)
let's use the old footage of the trailer (67:49 - 67:54)
of the trainer in the blue shirt and now (67:51 - 67:57)
we have this new footage from our second (67:54 - 68:00)
iteration of the game where he now has a (67:57 - 68:03)
red shirt like that doesn't happen I (68:00 - 68:04)
think if I remember correctly the (68:03 - 68:07)
person's original argument was that (68:04 - 68:10)
perhaps the trainer looked different in (68:07 - 68:12)
the two versions of the game but I would (68:10 - 68:14)
say that's an (68:12 - 68:17)
equally ridiculous option I think it's (68:14 - 68:19)
it it was clear to me as well that you (68:17 - 68:23)
had customization right you don't show (68:19 - 68:26)
off skin color and then show off two (68:23 - 68:29)
different shirts and that's to me that's (68:26 - 68:31)
obvious you're teasing it before you're (68:29 - 68:34)
announcing it uh I think the dying (68:31 - 68:35)
though is awesome cuz there are (68:34 - 68:38)
definitely clothes that I liked in (68:35 - 68:40)
Callos that I just wish were a different (68:38 - 68:44)
color mhm I think that's a an excellent (68:40 - 68:46)
solution did you notice the fact that (68:44 - 68:48)
you don't buy these or at least from (68:46 - 68:50)
what we saw you don't buy these with (68:48 - 68:52)
Pokey dollars you instead have a (68:50 - 68:54)
secondary currency that's coint some (68:52 - 68:57)
sort of coin no I didn't notice that (68:54 - 68:59)
yeah which is which I think is very cool (68:57 - 69:02)
because wow those clothes were expensive (68:59 - 69:04)
in X and (69:02 - 69:07)
Y I think it's cool that it's it seems (69:04 - 69:09)
to be another currency that or they're (69:07 - 69:12)
completely replacing poked dollars (69:09 - 69:13)
whatever with whatever this currency is (69:12 - 69:16)
but I would find that unlikely right (69:13 - 69:18)
right right looks like they got rid of (69:16 - 69:21)
Pokemon am and they're renaming it well (69:18 - 69:22)
they're bringing it back but they're (69:21 - 69:25)
renaming it Pokemon refresh (69:22 - 69:27)
uh a feature that lets you take care uh (69:25 - 69:29)
that lets you care for your Pokemon I'm (69:27 - 69:33)
going to be honest I uh it is raining (69:29 - 69:35)
really hard here all of a sudden I'm (69:33 - 69:36)
going to be honest I never thanks for (69:35 - 69:39)
your honesty uh I'm going to be honest (69:36 - 69:42)
it's it's pouring outside right now I (69:39 - 69:45)
never played Pokemon am me for more than (69:42 - 69:47)
60 seconds I didn't spend a lot of time (69:45 - 69:51)
with it either I I recognized that there (69:47 - 69:53)
were cool things about it but I didn't (69:51 - 69:57)
do much of with it either I can't I (69:53 - 69:59)
couldn't tell you what what this new (69:57 - 70:01)
version is taking out or putting in or (69:59 - 70:03)
keeping there seem to be a lot more (70:01 - 70:07)
grooming options like you can blow dry (70:03 - 70:09)
your Oren guru's hair which you couldn't (70:07 - 70:11)
do before it seems specific to grooming (70:09 - 70:13)
a lot of options that weren't (70:11 - 70:16)
necessarily there before and one me to (70:13 - 70:19)
me the name change screams that people (70:16 - 70:22)
didn't understand exactly what it was I (70:19 - 70:25)
feel like changing AI to refresh is is (70:22 - 70:29)
an an easier way for maybe kids or or (70:25 - 70:31)
just the general who people don't who (70:29 - 70:34)
don't speak (70:31 - 70:36)
French just think it's like hey we need (70:34 - 70:38)
to simplify this name cuz we don't want (70:36 - 70:40)
to get rid of this well and they had to (70:38 - 70:42)
change it because Callos was based on (70:40 - 70:46)
France and yeah Sun and Moon are are not (70:42 - 70:48)
so and alola is not so they had to (70:46 - 70:51)
change it somehow uh what I got here is (70:48 - 70:53)
after a battle Pokemon can sometimes end (70:51 - 70:57)
up rumpled and dirty Pokémon refresh (70:53 - 70:59)
lets you clean them up care for them (70:57 - 71:03)
feed them poke beans and even cure (70:59 - 71:05)
status conditions like poisoning and (71:03 - 71:08)
paralysis oh now you've got my attention (71:05 - 71:12)
inflicted on them in battle Pokemon that (71:08 - 71:14)
have been looked after in Pokemon (71:12 - 71:16)
refresh can grow very affectionate and (71:14 - 71:19)
will battle to the utmost for you this (71:16 - 71:21)
means that sometimes they may avoid (71:19 - 71:24)
attacks from the opposing Pokémon or (71:21 - 71:26)
even hold out when they are willing when (71:24 - 71:28)
they are on the verge of fainting take (71:26 - 71:30)
good care of your Pokemon and Pokemon (71:28 - 71:33)
refresh and they will be great allies on (71:30 - 71:35)
your adventure that's cool that they're (71:33 - 71:38)
adding more I I I remember that there (71:35 - 71:41)
was some added benefit where I think (71:38 - 71:42)
your Pokemon would level up more quickly (71:41 - 71:44)
you would get more experience if you (71:42 - 71:47)
paid attention to them and Pokemon on me (71:44 - 71:49)
but it's cool that they're adding more (71:47 - 71:51)
effects like that with refresh I think (71:49 - 71:54)
that's neat yeah uh finally the last bit (71:51 - 71:56)
of news that came out of here at least (71:54 - 71:58)
in my press release is uh the Nintendo (71:56 - 72:02)
3DS downloadable software Pokemon Bank (71:58 - 72:05)
an application that enables Pokemon and (72:02 - 72:07)
enables players to put Pokemon that (72:05 - 72:09)
they've had on past Adventures into an (72:07 - 72:11)
internet based storage boxes will be (72:09 - 72:13)
receiving an update in January of (72:11 - 72:16)
2017 this update will give Pokemon Bank (72:13 - 72:18)
application compatibility with Pokemon (72:16 - 72:21)
Sun and Pokemon new moon and include a (72:18 - 72:24)
new National Pokedex feature this Fe (72:21 - 72:27)
this Pokedex feature reads save data (72:24 - 72:29)
from any compatible titles you connect (72:27 - 72:31)
to Pokemon bank and collects the (72:29 - 72:32)
information about the Pokemon that you (72:31 - 72:35)
have caught you can then check out all (72:32 - 72:36)
this information on Pokemon Bank (72:35 - 72:38)
application and even see Pokemon that (72:36 - 72:41)
don't natally appear in the alola region (72:38 - 72:44)
Pokemon transporter will be updated to (72:41 - 72:46)
make Virtual Console versions of Pokemon (72:44 - 72:48)
red blue and yellow compatible with (72:46 - 72:50)
Pokémon Bank this means that players (72:48 - 72:52)
this means that Pokémon players caught (72:50 - 72:55)
in the VG original Kanto games will be (72:52 - 72:57)
transferred across into Pokemon Sun and (72:55 - 73:00)
Moon and there you go if I'm (72:57 - 73:02)
understanding that paragraph that I just (73:00 - 73:05)
read correctly it is that once the (73:02 - 73:09)
update hits in January that Pokemon sun (73:05 - 73:11)
and moon will read your Pokemon bank and (73:09 - 73:14)
then fill in the Pokedex appropriately (73:11 - 73:16)
so you don't have to transfer them all (73:14 - 73:18)
to Sun and Moon wait for it to register (73:16 - 73:21)
and then transfer it back sounds like it (73:18 - 73:25)
to me I guess or that Pokemon bank will (73:21 - 73:26)
have its own (73:25 - 73:29)
pokedex in it and will register how many (73:26 - 73:31)
Pokemon you've seen and caught or I (73:29 - 73:34)
guess just you that you have in Pokemon (73:31 - 73:36)
bank I could interpret it either way I'm (73:34 - 73:39)
not exactly sure I would love for it to (73:36 - 73:43)
just link those dexes together not that (73:39 - 73:46)
like transferring them to your your your (73:43 - 73:51)
game is hard but my worry would be my (73:46 - 73:55)
concern is I you know drag and drop all (73:51 - 73:56)
my Pokemon to the (73:55 - 73:59)
boxes in Sun and (73:56 - 74:03)
Moon and then I close Pokemon bank I (73:59 - 74:08)
open sun and moon and the UPS driver you (74:03 - 74:10)
know knocks on my door to drop off my (74:08 - 74:14)
Amazon package and then I turn around (74:10 - 74:17)
because I hear this crash and my cat has (74:14 - 74:20)
picked up my 3DS and ran into the (74:17 - 74:22)
bathroom and dropped it in the (74:20 - 74:26)
toilet and (74:22 - 74:29)
now and now all my Pokemon that were (74:26 - 74:33)
safe on Pokemon Bank were temporarily on (74:29 - 74:36)
my Pokemon Sun digital (74:33 - 74:39)
download which is now at the bottom of a (74:36 - 74:43)
toilet and is hosed and there's no way (74:39 - 74:45)
for me to transfer those back to bank (74:43 - 74:48)
and therefore my bank is now empty and (74:45 - 74:51)
those Pokemon are lost forever I don't (74:48 - 74:53)
know that that's what we're getting (74:51 - 74:56)
given that that would it would be hard (74:53 - 74:58)
to prevent people from duplicating (74:56 - 75:00)
Pokemon in that instance what do you (74:58 - 75:03)
mean duplicating Pokemon because all of (75:00 - 75:09)
those Pokemon so say your 3DS doesn't (75:03 - 75:12)
get dropped in the toilet then (75:09 - 75:14)
you if what you're saying is Pokemon (75:12 - 75:16)
bank is sort of a backup for all of (75:14 - 75:19)
those Pokemon but what if you don't drop (75:16 - 75:20)
your 3DS in the toilet then you could (75:19 - 75:22)
just transfer all of those Pokemon that (75:20 - 75:25)
you backed up to some other game and (75:22 - 75:27)
just do that an infinite amount of times (75:25 - 75:29)
because they're backed up in two places (75:27 - 75:31)
maybe I'm not making sense I don't know (75:29 - 75:32)
no well when you move them to a game (75:31 - 75:34)
they're no longer in bank it's not (75:32 - 75:37)
duplicating them it's just saying that (75:34 - 75:38)
so so what is your what is the situation (75:37 - 75:40)
that you're saying my situation in the (75:38 - 75:42)
toilet my situation is I don't want to (75:40 - 75:44)
transfer all those Pokemon to my game (75:42 - 75:47)
and then have my game be damaged because (75:44 - 75:48)
then there's then my bank is completely (75:47 - 75:51)
empty and I can't right but how would (75:48 - 75:53)
this do anything how unless unless this (75:51 - 75:56)
is filling your bank when the Pokemon (75:53 - 75:57)
are transferred how what does this (75:56 - 75:59)
change this would change this would just (75:57 - 76:01)
say this would just check the Sun and (75:59 - 76:04)
Moon Pokedex with bank so it's just (76:01 - 76:07)
saying you own your poke your Pokedex (76:04 - 76:09)
still right yeah it's not it's not (76:07 - 76:12)
moving Pokemon it's just updating the (76:09 - 76:14)
decks in Sun and Moon to say okay we've (76:12 - 76:17)
checked your bank you do own Victini you (76:14 - 76:19)
do own Gena sect don't worry about (76:17 - 76:22)
transferring them over we know yeah got (76:19 - 76:26)
it but it wouldn't give you those (76:22 - 76:29)
Pokemon check it now we're on the same (76:26 - 76:34)
track um I I'm I I would assume in the (76:29 - 76:36)
all internet world that we will (76:34 - 76:39)
eventually get down to the road of there (76:36 - 76:42)
not being a someone's PC that bank is (76:39 - 76:46)
just that PC for every future game Bill (76:42 - 76:49)
you're getting out (76:46 - 76:51)

we're going to be I'm going to be (79:29 - 79:33)
sitting down with gyen Hunter uh (79:30 - 79:35)
youtube.com/ gyen Hunter if you want to (79:33 - 79:39)
see his monster hunter content but we're (79:35 - 79:40)
going to talk about some Pokemon some (79:39 - 79:43)
Monster Hunter and uh living in Japan so (79:40 - 79:46)
we will be right (79:43 - 79:46)
back (79:52 - 79:55)
he (80:22 - 80:25)
and we are back from our break with our (80:29 - 80:36)
special guest here uh it's weird because (80:34 - 80:38)
we always I always record these first (80:36 - 80:39)
and then edit them in afterward so I (80:38 - 80:41)
probably said earlier in the episode who (80:39 - 80:43)
the guest was but I am here with Adam (80:41 - 80:46)
who is also known as gyen Hunter is that (80:43 - 80:48)
how you say it Gan I'm really bad with (80:46 - 80:50)
words here yes gun Hunter I know some (80:48 - 80:52)
people I hear them gun Hunter and it (80:50 - 80:55)
just kills me but yeah gun (80:52 - 81:00)
Hunter and you are known online you're I (80:55 - 81:02)
feel like you're all your entire online (81:00 - 81:04)
presence is you are the Monster Hunter (81:02 - 81:08)
guy that doesn't work for (81:04 - 81:10)
Capcom I've heard people say that a lot (81:08 - 81:11)
um some people actually think I work for (81:10 - 81:14)
Capcom what I don't I just I just love (81:11 - 81:17)
the game Monster Hunter yeah and uh we (81:14 - 81:19)
here at it super effective love Monster (81:17 - 81:20)
Hunter we usually mention it on the (81:19 - 81:22)
early Parts it's what we've been playing (81:20 - 81:24)
it's we have the slack community of you (81:22 - 81:26)
know 200 plus people and besides and (81:24 - 81:27)
everyone that obviously loves Pokemon (81:26 - 81:29)
they listen to the podcast but the (81:27 - 81:31)
biggest Channel outside of just the (81:29 - 81:33)
normal Pokemon channels is the Monster (81:31 - 81:34)
Hunter Channel which is actually (81:33 - 81:37)
probably the most active Channel and (81:34 - 81:40)
it's great and I a I have a million (81:37 - 81:42)
questions to ask you um but I I want to (81:40 - 81:44)
point out to our listeners and I've said (81:42 - 81:46)
this a million times and I think Adam (81:44 - 81:48)
will agree I feel like the monster (81:46 - 81:51)
hunter Community is the most helpful (81:48 - 81:53)
community of any kind of video game in (81:51 - 81:55)
the world like they are so willing to (81:53 - 81:58)
help other people get into the game (81:55 - 82:00)
absolutely I I I mean there's a lot of (81:58 - 82:01)
reasons I think that contribute to that (82:00 - 82:03)
but like yeah like in general like (82:01 - 82:05)
people go out of their way to help (82:03 - 82:08)
people and make guides and and play with (82:05 - 82:10)
people who are you know lower ranked (82:08 - 82:11)
than them and all that kind of stuff (82:10 - 82:13)
it's it's it's just a really great (82:11 - 82:15)
Cooperative Community yeah yeah well (82:13 - 82:17)
before we get in uh just like all (82:15 - 82:19)
interviews that I've done we've done a (82:17 - 82:22)
lot recently uh if if you're coming into (82:19 - 82:24)
this intervie because of Adam or just (82:22 - 82:26)
because you're love of monar Hunter we (82:24 - 82:28)
did interview recently Dan rer from (82:26 - 82:32)
Giant Bomb we've recently did uh Austin (82:28 - 82:34)
Creed from up up down down AKA Xavier (82:32 - 82:36)
Woods from WWE AKA he probably has a (82:34 - 82:41)
million other names but Adam who are you (82:36 - 82:45)
besides gyen Hunter who am I um I guess (82:41 - 82:46)
the most simple way to just put it is (82:45 - 82:50)
I'm I'm an American guy who lives in (82:46 - 82:52)
Japan and who's obsessed with Monster (82:50 - 82:54)
hunting (82:52 - 82:55)
yeah we were talking about the time (82:54 - 82:57)
difference before before we started (82:55 - 83:00)
recording that it's 700 p.m. here and 8 (82:57 - 83:02)
or 9:00 a.m. your time yes I'm in the (83:00 - 83:05)
future speaking back in time to (83:02 - 83:09)
you so a couple questions about your (83:05 - 83:10)
life you currently live in Japan but (83:09 - 83:13)
you're American uh when did you when did (83:10 - 83:15)
you go over there what what made you (83:13 - 83:19)
make that life choice of moving across (83:15 - 83:20)
the world so I get this question a lot (83:19 - 83:23)
and and it's never an easy one answer so (83:20 - 83:25)
try to give a short answer but like as (83:23 - 83:26)
far as I can remember back in like (83:25 - 83:28)
Elementary I've always been obsessed (83:26 - 83:31)
with everything Japan I have no idea why (83:28 - 83:33)
it actually was before I got introduced (83:31 - 83:35)
to games um but all throughout my life I (83:33 - 83:37)
just I dreamt of living here and coming (83:35 - 83:40)
here and and doing something here so um (83:37 - 83:42)
right right after I turned 21 I (83:40 - 83:44)
literally just quit my job quit (83:42 - 83:46)
everything and moved over here um I just (83:44 - 83:48)
saved up enough money to do like one (83:46 - 83:49)
year of language school so I can learn (83:48 - 83:51)
the language cuz I'm from Cleveland Ohio (83:49 - 83:53)
and in Cleveland you can't they don't (83:51 - 83:55)
exactly have Japanese language courses (83:53 - 83:58)
all over the place right so so I wanted (83:55 - 84:00)
to come here and learn the language so I (83:58 - 84:01)
I quit everything it came over when I (84:00 - 84:05)
was 21 and I've it was make it or SN and (84:01 - 84:07)
I've I've managed to make it okay and uh (84:05 - 84:09)
I've been here now for 14 and 1 12 years (84:07 - 84:12)
it's crazy how time flies that's insane (84:09 - 84:15)
did 21 did you have some college no (84:12 - 84:19)
college no College um I did find before (84:15 - 84:21)
I moved here for about half a year there (84:19 - 84:23)
was um (84:21 - 84:25)
uh it wasn't even a Japanese teacher but (84:23 - 84:26)
a really good teacher at the local (84:25 - 84:28)
Community College who did some basic (84:26 - 84:30)
Japanese so I did take like a very basic (84:28 - 84:32)
course for half a year which was good (84:30 - 84:34)
gives me a little idea of what the (84:32 - 84:36)
grammar is like you know what hiana and (84:34 - 84:40)
Katakana were but um yeah so no I was (84:36 - 84:41)
just really just working full-time since (84:40 - 84:45)
I've been 15 really okay how was that (84:41 - 84:49)
LifeWise though for like for me I I live (84:45 - 84:51)
in Wisconsin I've always wanted to move (84:49 - 84:54)
to a different state I just don't enjoy (84:51 - 84:57)
the Milwaukee area but I I know it's (84:54 - 84:59)
doable but the thing that like sits at (84:57 - 85:01)
the top of my head is okay I got to get (84:59 - 85:02)
a job okay my girlfriend has to get a (85:01 - 85:04)
job okay like I have three cats how do I (85:02 - 85:07)
move them in a car or anywhere else (85:04 - 85:10)
across where did I was I was lucky like (85:07 - 85:12)
when I was 21 I didn't have anything so (85:10 - 85:14)
I didn't have like I didn't have a (85:12 - 85:17)
girlfriend I I'm even to this day I'm (85:14 - 85:20)
not very big into owning stuff or having (85:17 - 85:23)
possessions so I literally had one suit (85:20 - 85:25)
that's all I had when I came here and I (85:23 - 85:26)
just told my parents anything else I (85:25 - 85:27)
have throw away or just give away to (85:26 - 85:29)
somebody I don't care um so yeah just (85:27 - 85:31)
one suitcase come on over and uh it was (85:29 - 85:33)
the right time I think in my life where (85:31 - 85:35)
I had enough freedom to do it and I just (85:33 - 85:37)
did it like now that I'm a family guy I (85:35 - 85:40)
couldn't possibly do a huge move like (85:37 - 85:41)
that it would be much more complicated (85:40 - 85:44)
like you were saying right right um but (85:41 - 85:47)
it was a good time for me I think does (85:44 - 85:48)
how often do you get back out of Japan (85:47 - 85:51)
I'm sure your your your parents uh (85:48 - 85:53)
weren't a fan of that decision of you (85:51 - 85:55)
moving across the world they were total (85:53 - 85:57)
fans they they help support to bring me (85:55 - 85:58)
over because they knew I've been (85:57 - 86:00)
obsessed with the country and they they (85:58 - 86:01)
they just want their children to be (86:00 - 86:04)
happy so they were really supportive um (86:01 - 86:06)
both emotionally and also even (86:04 - 86:08)
financially to start um so they were (86:06 - 86:10)
fine with uh helping me get over here so (86:08 - 86:12)
that was really awesome of them and you (86:10 - 86:13)
know I it breaks their heart that I (86:12 - 86:15)
haven't really come back and I it (86:13 - 86:18)
doesn't look like I'm moving back um but (86:15 - 86:21)
they're happy that I'm happy so uh I try (86:18 - 86:23)
to take that as a parent as well and (86:21 - 86:24)
hope hopefully I can have the same (86:23 - 86:27)
mindset because I I think it's great um (86:24 - 86:28)
but I don't get back a lot you know (86:27 - 86:30)
because it's not (86:28 - 86:32)
even for at first it was kind of like (86:30 - 86:33)
the money right because to fly back cost (86:32 - 86:35)
a lot of money but now that I work (86:33 - 86:37)
full-time here um and I obviously do (86:35 - 86:39)
YouTube on top of that and I'm a family (86:37 - 86:42)
guy I just can't get the time off so I (86:39 - 86:44)
think I've been back to Cleveland though (86:42 - 86:46)
about four times in the last four or (86:44 - 86:49)
five times in the last 15 years almost (86:46 - 86:52)
um about once every 2 3 years um so not (86:49 - 86:53)
not so often not like some people who go (86:52 - 86:55)
back like once a year or anything like (86:53 - 86:58)
that um but hopefully I can convince (86:55 - 87:00)
them to come out (86:58 - 87:00)
here for again I have a million Monster (87:00 - 87:07)
Hunter questions but I kind of want to (87:04 - 87:10)
touch on Japan a little bit more yes yes (87:07 - 87:12)
Japan's great by the way guys like if (87:10 - 87:14)
you you guys want to come here if you're (87:12 - 87:16)
younger and you're think I'd love to (87:14 - 87:18)
work live in Japan one day like it can (87:16 - 87:21)
happen it's awesome place it truly (87:18 - 87:23)
is so I'm spoiled I can't live in a (87:21 - 87:25)
bigger city now that I've lived in Tokyo (87:23 - 87:28)
it's like a it's safer than Cleveland (87:25 - 87:30)
and that was just a suburb right it's (87:28 - 87:32)
good stuff big monster hunter guy you (87:30 - 87:34)
are but I did see you tweeting about (87:32 - 87:36)
Pokémon go playing Pokémon go you were (87:34 - 87:38)
actually recently on the 8 Fourplay (87:36 - 87:41)
podcast talking about your your initial (87:38 - 87:43)
thoughts of Pokemon go is that is this (87:41 - 87:45)
is my Pokemon transition obviously is (87:43 - 87:47)
that is that something you're still (87:45 - 87:48)
playing something you're still (87:47 - 87:51)
interested in or uh where did that fall (87:48 - 87:55)
so I mean I definitely want to be (87:51 - 87:56)
interested in trying things that are (87:55 - 87:58)
becoming really popular because (87:56 - 88:00)
obviously for my day job or or just in (87:58 - 88:01)
general it's good to understand why (88:00 - 88:03)
things are popular and I've never really (88:01 - 88:06)
been a Pokemon guy um however I did play (88:03 - 88:07)
one Pokemon game which I'll get to (88:06 - 88:09)
probably a little bit later but I was (88:07 - 88:11)
really interested to see how it goes so (88:09 - 88:12)
I went ahead and downloaded when it came (88:11 - 88:15)
out and I got hooked like (88:12 - 88:19)
hardcore So within the first um I think (88:15 - 88:22)
two weeks I got up to level 23 which is (88:19 - 88:24)
where I'm still sitting unfortunately I (88:22 - 88:26)
bought like walking shorts like you name (88:24 - 88:28)
it like I went crazy so I've put in over (88:26 - 88:31)
I think I'm I think I'm at about30 km (88:28 - 88:34)
registered on the game um but yeah (88:31 - 88:35)
Pokémon go has been really fun (88:34 - 88:37)
especially in Tokyo like even here I'm (88:35 - 88:39)
in the suburb it's not so good there's (88:37 - 88:41)
not a lot of poke spots but downtown (88:39 - 88:44)
Tokyo where I work you can't even walk (88:41 - 88:46)
like 10 seconds without hitting (88:44 - 88:48)
something like it's just ridiculous so (88:46 - 88:50)
Pokémon go was really fun everybody else (88:48 - 88:53)
was doing it in Japan um I don't really (88:50 - 88:55)
play it as much right now because I (88:53 - 88:57)
don't really like the radar system I (88:55 - 88:59)
don't like the idea that I can leave my (88:57 - 89:01)
house and I know there's something (88:59 - 89:03)
nearby but I don't know if I should go (89:01 - 89:05)
left forward back or right and if I take (89:03 - 89:07)
the wrong direction it'll be gone by (89:05 - 89:09)
time I get back and try another (89:07 - 89:11)
Direction so to me it feels a little too (89:09 - 89:13)
random so I think if they can fix it (89:11 - 89:16)
like I noticed they were doing some uh (89:13 - 89:18)
like some testing in some cities they (89:16 - 89:20)
can bring that to Japan I'll probably be (89:18 - 89:23)
right back in Full full swing it's it's (89:20 - 89:25)
been a little over two months now since (89:23 - 89:27)
Pokemon go came out are you still seeing (89:25 - 89:30)
people playing it in your area obviously (89:27 - 89:31)
Japan (89:30 - 89:34)
is one of the biggest areas for Pokemon (89:31 - 89:36)
but are do you look over somebody's (89:34 - 89:38)
shoulder and and they're playing it on (89:36 - 89:39)
the the train or Subway people are still (89:38 - 89:42)
playing it I thought that you know (89:39 - 89:43)
everyone says oh the initial hype died (89:42 - 89:45)
out or whatever but I'm if you go (89:43 - 89:47)
outside everyone's playing it um I was I (89:45 - 89:50)
just actually on Twitter I was on a boat (89:47 - 89:52)
going towards a certain part in Tokyo (89:50 - 89:54)
and there was like a huge rush of people (89:52 - 89:56)
and it end up becoming like news like (89:54 - 89:57)
some rare Pokémon came out and everyone (89:56 - 89:59)
went crazy but yeah people are still (89:57 - 90:01)
playing it a lot late at night you'll (89:59 - 90:03)
see a lot of couples walking around with (90:01 - 90:05)
their phones um you go through any park (90:03 - 90:07)
and there's usually about a good 200 (90:05 - 90:10)
people just standing there it's really (90:07 - 90:13)
funny unbelievable yeah so I'd say it's (90:10 - 90:14)
still going pretty darn strong here uh I (90:13 - 90:17)
think the the mainstream hype has maybe (90:14 - 90:19)
down died down a little bit and now it's (90:17 - 90:21)
more or less that core audience and a (90:19 - 90:24)
little bit of the light to midcore users (90:21 - 90:26)
um but I think all they need is an (90:24 - 90:27)
update and you'll get a whole bunch of (90:26 - 90:29)
more people in there again right right (90:27 - 90:33)
yeah my my sister who not a Pokemon fan (90:29 - 90:35)
at all I mean she was when she was like (90:33 - 90:37)
eight or nine but she's still hooked I'm (90:35 - 90:40)
actually yeah she's still super hooked (90:37 - 90:42)
on Pokemon go she texts me screenshots (90:40 - 90:44)
of like of like oh I just caught a (90:42 - 90:47)
Scyther today yeah and then I I took my (90:44 - 90:48)
mom home from work cuz she didn't have (90:47 - 90:51)
her car for the weekend and she was just (90:48 - 90:53)
letting me hear G giving me an earful of (90:51 - 90:55)
Pokémon go of like oh I caught that egg (90:53 - 90:57)
Pokemon I caught the the bird I'm sick (90:55 - 91:00)
of the bird Pokemon H I love eggs and I (90:57 - 91:03)
was like M I'm always curious outside of (91:00 - 91:05)
the my bubble I've I've used Pokémon go (91:03 - 91:08)
to get my daughter into Pokemon because (91:05 - 91:11)
she's seven and she anytime I try to get (91:08 - 91:13)
her interested in Pokemon cuz even if (91:11 - 91:14)
I'm not a huge fan at first like I know (91:13 - 91:16)
it's a great game and i' I've had fun (91:14 - 91:17)
with the game that I played so I wanted (91:16 - 91:20)
her to get into it so um I used Pokemon (91:17 - 91:23)
go to do that so like she's hooked like (91:20 - 91:24)
anytime we go out she's like boot up (91:23 - 91:26)
Pokémon (91:24 - 91:29)
go and she's really good she she can she (91:26 - 91:32)
can throw curves better than I can um (91:29 - 91:34)
but she she gets a kick out of uh of (91:32 - 91:36)
catching the Pokemon and and evolving (91:34 - 91:39)
them and so now she's hooked on Pokemon (91:36 - 91:42)
and then now she convinced me she wanted (91:39 - 91:45)
to play X and Y so I I bought uh I think (91:42 - 91:47)
it was X for her so she's playing that (91:45 - 91:49)
right now so it's her first game all in (91:47 - 91:51)
sort of you know since the master plan (91:49 - 91:53)
as a father father of having a second (91:51 - 91:56)
player for Sun and Moon so she she's (91:53 - 91:58)
totally hooked now she loves the Pokemon (91:56 - 92:00)
and she's like yeah I want to I really (91:58 - 92:02)
want Moon I'm like no I want Moon she's (92:00 - 92:04)
like no I want Moon I'm like well if you (92:02 - 92:07)
get moon I have to get sun right fine (92:04 - 92:09)
I'll get sun you get moon I was I was (92:07 - 92:11)
going to ask if you were interested in (92:09 - 92:13)
Sun and Moon because I feel like that's (92:11 - 92:15)
that was like Pokemon's key marketing of (92:13 - 92:18)
like Get go out and now build that hype (92:15 - 92:20)
for Sun and Moon I'm tell you it's (92:18 - 92:22)
working on us I mean because sun and (92:20 - 92:24)
moon I saw the trailers the game looks (92:22 - 92:27)
fantastic um it looks a lot actually (92:24 - 92:28)
like U Monster Hunter stories which is (92:27 - 92:30)
coming out um very soon in a few weeks (92:28 - 92:34)
here um you know same idea 3D turn-based (92:30 - 92:36)
you can ride on your Pokemon your (92:34 - 92:38)
monsters you know fun environments (92:36 - 92:40)
colorful it looks great um but of course (92:38 - 92:43)
Pokemon has such a rich library of of of (92:40 - 92:45)
monsters that you can play around with (92:43 - 92:47)
so I immediately thought that I wanted (92:45 - 92:48)
to play it I don't know how much time I (92:47 - 92:50)
can dedicate to it because monster huner (92:48 - 92:51)
stories is going to take a lot of my (92:50 - 92:55)
time but I knew I was interested so I (92:51 - 92:56)
was going to get it but now that I've (92:55 - 92:58)
got my daughter hyped like it just seals (92:56 - 93:00)
the deal so to say however I may be a (92:58 - 93:02)
little late playing it because again (93:00 - 93:04)
I'll be focusing on masah Hunter and I (93:02 - 93:08)
want to get her a 3DS 2DS actually for (93:04 - 93:10)
Christmas so I might make her wait a (93:08 - 93:12)
little bit before we get it so that she (93:10 - 93:15)
can have her her first game system oh (93:12 - 93:17)
that's super exciting that'll be that'll (93:15 - 93:19)
be good for her I think there seems to (93:17 - 93:23)
be an overlap in Pokemon fans and (93:19 - 93:25)
Monster Hunter Fans here in the in in (93:23 - 93:28)
the west do you see that where you are (93:25 - 93:31)
in Japan honestly I wouldn't say that I (93:28 - 93:33)
necessarily do then again I think (93:31 - 93:35)
there's so many I think by default (93:33 - 93:37)
almost everyone in Japan likes Pokemon (93:35 - 93:40)
so I it's kind of hard for to say okay (93:37 - 93:41)
do you like games yeah do you like (93:40 - 93:43)
Pokemon yeah it's like okay well (93:41 - 93:45)
technically it overlaps with everything (93:43 - 93:47)
at that point um so it's kind of it's so (93:45 - 93:49)
popular here that I think it's almost (93:47 - 93:52)
impossible to distinguish but um I mean (93:49 - 93:54)
I mean I I don't know I haven't really (93:52 - 93:57)
run into most of my interaction of (93:54 - 93:58)
course was with gamers in the west when (93:57 - 94:00)
it comes to Monster Hunters so to be (93:58 - 94:02)
honest I'm not quite sure but I'd assume (94:00 - 94:03)
that there's some overlap I mean it's (94:02 - 94:07)
the same principles right and uh and um (94:03 - 94:09)
the cooperation they working together (94:07 - 94:11)
personal growth monsters that kind of (94:09 - 94:13)
stuff so but then again like Pokemon (94:11 - 94:15)
fans are like Monster Hunter Fans right (94:13 - 94:17)
like you play it religiously all year (94:15 - 94:20)
round so I can imagine it could be a (94:17 - 94:21)
conflict of interest when you have two (94:20 - 94:23)
Hobbies like that you know battling for (94:21 - 94:27)
your time right right totally so you I I (94:23 - 94:29)
imagine that everyone will lean towards (94:27 - 94:31)
one or the other when pushed to give a (94:29 - 94:34)
choice what to play mhm yeah and we both (94:31 - 94:36)
know Monster Hunter is one of the most (94:34 - 94:38)
timec consuming games out there exactly (94:36 - 94:40)
I don't know about I mean I played (94:38 - 94:42)
Pokemon Black that was the only Pokemon (94:40 - 94:44)
I played because the marketing here in (94:42 - 94:47)
Japan was huge for that game on the DS (94:44 - 94:49)
so I went ahead and that was my first (94:47 - 94:51)
Pokemon experience and I got 100% on (94:49 - 94:53)
that game I went crazy (94:51 - 94:55)
and I I have one really one funny story (94:53 - 94:57)
where I'm still upset about the street (94:55 - 94:59)
pass I don't know have you played (94:57 - 95:01)
through black yep yeah so you know how (94:59 - 95:03)
you're in that town it looks like (95:01 - 95:04)
skyscrapers like the old city town and (95:03 - 95:05)
there's a place where they do like (95:04 - 95:09)
Street pass surveys yes that is the main (95:05 - 95:14)
city main city Hub I can't Celia I think (95:09 - 95:16)
I'm probably getting that every day at (95:14 - 95:18)
work and then I'd go to Shinjuku station (95:16 - 95:19)
which is one of the most busiest (95:18 - 95:22)
stations in all of Japan and and I would (95:19 - 95:23)
stand there on the platform for the (95:22 - 95:25)
trains Street passing people for like 2 (95:23 - 95:27)
hours I did this after work like every (95:25 - 95:30)
day for weeks and I got I it was I mean (95:27 - 95:32)
I I can't remember the exact number it (95:30 - 95:34)
was over 10,000 people I Street passed (95:32 - 95:36)
and I completed all the challenges and (95:34 - 95:38)
they give you nothing and I was so upset (95:36 - 95:39)
about (95:38 - 95:42)
that it's one of my bitter memories is (95:39 - 95:43)
that I've completed every single one of (95:42 - 95:45)
the street pass challenges and I got (95:43 - 95:47)
nothing worthwhile for it but uh I had a (95:45 - 95:49)
lot of fun with the game but um I think (95:47 - 95:53)
cuz I overdid it um I I sort of stepped (95:49 - 95:54)
out from the series after that and went (95:53 - 95:56)
back to Monster Hunter but I mean I put (95:54 - 95:58)
a good probably few hundred hours into (95:56 - 96:00)
that but I mean I don't know if Pokemon (95:58 - 96:02)
you can drive a few thousand hours out (96:00 - 96:04)
of it I don't know I'm sure I'm sure (96:02 - 96:07)
some people can the the thing about the (96:04 - 96:08)
thing about Pokemon is there's there's (96:07 - 96:11)
so many so many outlets to go to like (96:08 - 96:12)
some people are really into breeding (96:11 - 96:14)
some people are into battling some (96:12 - 96:15)
people are into collecting and I feel (96:14 - 96:18)
like collecting has its has its end well (96:15 - 96:20)
not really cuz then people go for Shiny (96:18 - 96:22)
Pokemon or oh yeah I forgot everyone (96:20 - 96:24)
talk about the the perfect uh the (96:22 - 96:29)
perfect stats right yep yeah yeah no for (96:24 - 96:32)
so you are best known at least your (96:29 - 96:34)
online presence is best known for (96:32 - 96:37)
Monster Hunter how did you get into that (96:34 - 96:39)
Series this is actually really funny CU (96:37 - 96:41)
you were mentioning 84 play um I (96:39 - 96:43)
actually got into it because of 84 play (96:41 - 96:45)
so I mean I living in Japan I always (96:43 - 96:46)
knew monsterart was a thing right how (96:45 - 96:49)
can you not right and I think it was (96:46 - 96:51)
back on I think mon portable third Maybe (96:49 - 96:53)
maybe when I was here and I was like wow (96:51 - 96:55)
this thing's really popular and I had a (96:53 - 96:56)
PSP I'm like okay I'll give it a shot (96:55 - 96:58)
and I tried it and I think I tried it (96:56 - 97:00)
for like an hour I'm like no not for me (96:58 - 97:02)
and I just completely forgot about the (97:00 - 97:04)
series and discarded it and then monster (97:02 - 97:07)
hun 3G was coming out here I think that (97:04 - 97:09)
was 200 12 or 13 I can't remember I (97:07 - 97:12)
think 12 I could be wrong but I was (97:09 - 97:14)
listening to I became friends with the (97:12 - 97:17)
the guys at 84 you know outside in in (97:14 - 97:19)
real life we met up and you know a lot (97:17 - 97:20)
of people in the industry here in Tokyo (97:19 - 97:23)
make friends so they're all in Japan too (97:20 - 97:25)
yeah yeah so I was listening to their (97:23 - 97:27)
podcast which was 84 play and it was (97:25 - 97:30)
Mark McDonald and John talking about I (97:27 - 97:32)
think it was the Jen Moran fight and (97:30 - 97:34)
Mark was just going like oh my God like (97:32 - 97:35)
it just you know it was one of those (97:34 - 97:37)
moments like that I'll keep with me I (97:35 - 97:39)
was like I was like okay I got to give (97:37 - 97:41)
this a shot so they were doing a really (97:39 - 97:43)
big push for 3G here for the 3DS so I (97:41 - 97:47)
went ahead and bought the like (97:43 - 97:48)
everything I bought like the 3DS the (97:47 - 97:50)
game the entire limited edition said (97:48 - 97:52)
okay I'm giving this an honest shot (97:50 - 97:54)
and literally a week later I thought I (97:52 - 97:57)
was going to sell it cuz I hated (97:54 - 97:59)
it cuz it I didn't get it it didn't (97:57 - 98:01)
click right I went into it thinking it (97:59 - 98:02)
was an action game and I didn't think (98:01 - 98:04)
about it as a hunting game and I just (98:02 - 98:06)
had the wrong idea of what the loop was (98:04 - 98:09)
so after a little coaching from a (98:06 - 98:11)
coworker then going back and giving it (98:09 - 98:14)
another shot it just clicked one night (98:11 - 98:18)
and man it's I was gone ever since like (98:14 - 98:20)
once I clicked uh like I just yeah it (98:18 - 98:23)
went crazy so I've been hardcore into (98:20 - 98:25)
Monster Hunter since you know a month (98:23 - 98:28)
after the release of Monster Hunter 3G (98:25 - 98:30)
and it's never stopped since then okay (98:28 - 98:35)
yeah yeah I got in with 3u on on the Wii (98:30 - 98:37)
U and okay so we're birthed in by the (98:35 - 98:41)
same title so to say yeah and my my side (98:37 - 98:45)
of the the story was I got a Wii U it (98:41 - 98:46)
was collecting dust for months because I (98:45 - 98:48)
got it at launch nothing really came out (98:46 - 98:50)
I mean there was the Mario games and (98:48 - 98:52)
stuff but kind of burn through those (98:50 - 98:55)
really quick and yeah they were (98:52 - 98:59)
promoting the monster hunter 3u demo and (98:55 - 99:02)
so I I downloaded it and it probably sat (98:59 - 99:03)
on my Wii U for two or three weeks (99:02 - 99:06)
before I gave it a shot and the only (99:03 - 99:08)
reason I did was I believe it was Mark (99:06 - 99:10)
McDonald and I think he was on a (99:08 - 99:12)
different I think he was on a different (99:10 - 99:14)
podcast I want to say he was on a (99:12 - 99:18)
podcast right I I think he was on a (99:14 - 99:20)
podcast with Garnet Lee and he was (99:18 - 99:23)
explaining this huge fight in Monster (99:20 - 99:25)
Hunter and it just sounded so epic so (99:23 - 99:28)
awesome so I finally played it and the (99:25 - 99:31)
demo and I was like this is super (99:28 - 99:34)
sluggish this doesn't feel great I can't (99:31 - 99:37)
do any damage to this monster it was the (99:34 - 99:40)
uh the honey bear the Aur oh my gosh wow (99:37 - 99:42)
you you we have identical stories cuz (99:40 - 99:44)
that was the same one it was the arzuros (99:42 - 99:45)
yeah I was like I'm hitting him he's not (99:44 - 99:47)
even reacting I hit him for like 3 (99:45 - 99:49)
minutes he didn't even die like what's (99:47 - 99:51)
up with this and yeah oh my gosh BR this (99:49 - 99:52)
is funny (99:51 - 99:56)
and so I played it I I stepped away I (99:52 - 99:57)
came back like an hour later just (99:56 - 99:59)
because I was like I feel like I'm (99:57 - 100:01)
missing something and I was I was going (99:59 - 100:03)
through the weapons and I actually wait (100:01 - 100:05)
wait can I ask were did you try using (100:03 - 100:07)
dual blades at start yeah uh no I didn't (100:05 - 100:10)
I I tried with the sword and shield and (100:07 - 100:11)
then I went to like a bow gun and I was (100:10 - 100:15)
like this is even worse um and then I (100:11 - 100:17)
think I went to like the long sword and (100:15 - 100:19)
I was like this is terrible I I did end (100:17 - 100:23)
up minutes later timeout what the heck I (100:19 - 100:26)
did go to dual blades then and that's (100:23 - 100:28)
where like the the little click kicked (100:26 - 100:30)
in where I was like okay this feels a (100:28 - 100:33)
little bit better and then I went to the (100:30 - 100:35)
hammer and that's where I was like I I (100:33 - 100:39)
like this this feels good okay and (100:35 - 100:41)
so then I I purchased the game I was (100:39 - 100:44)
playing it it was it no joke it was it (100:41 - 100:46)
has been the only game in the past (100:44 - 100:49)
decade that I've gotten up early on my (100:46 - 100:51)
day off because I couldn't like I (100:49 - 100:53)
couldn't sleep I wanted to wake up early (100:51 - 100:56)
to play it oh nice it got in your head (100:53 - 100:57)
yeah it's one of the things I like to (100:56 - 100:59)
say um when I'm talking about mon hun (100:57 - 101:00)
it's just the way I like to think about (100:59 - 101:03)
it is that my time in Monster Hunter may (101:00 - 101:06)
be you know 3,000 hours but I have more (101:03 - 101:07)
play time outside the game than I have (101:06 - 101:09)
in the game because you're constantly (101:07 - 101:11)
thinking about it you're planning stuff (101:09 - 101:13)
you're researching stuff it's just it it (101:11 - 101:16)
takes over your life yeah and what what (101:13 - 101:18)
really helped is I think two things I (101:16 - 101:22)
think the Wii U to 3DS was like a huge (101:18 - 101:25)
um benefit of okay I can play this great (101:22 - 101:28)
on my TV the game looks gorgeous I could (101:25 - 101:30)
play with the Wii U controller or Wii U (101:28 - 101:33)
Pro controller and then I online too (101:30 - 101:35)
yeah yeah yeah and then I could take (101:33 - 101:37)
this out with me and just play on my 3DS (101:35 - 101:40)
I think that was such a great um feature (101:37 - 101:43)
set yeah and the other thing was my (101:40 - 101:45)
girlfriend was watching me play and she (101:43 - 101:47)
was like I she like this looks really (101:45 - 101:48)
cool and I was like I don't I don't (101:47 - 101:50)
think you'd like it cuz she's not like (101:48 - 101:51)
she's not a hardcore gamer like she (101:50 - 101:53)
plays Pokemon she plays like Tetris and (101:51 - 101:56)
stuff but so I just made a new character (101:53 - 101:57)
kind of set it up and I was like hey (101:56 - 101:59)
maybe you should start with like dual (101:57 - 102:00)
blades and stuff and like right away she (101:59 - 102:02)
was like oh this is really fun and I was (102:00 - 102:06)
like okay uh so she had a 3s we got uh (102:02 - 102:08)
her a copy of Monster Hunter and then it (102:06 - 102:10)
was like for two months straight that's (102:08 - 102:12)
all we did like every time we had free (102:10 - 102:14)
time it was like let's hunt together and (102:12 - 102:17)
that was such an incredible experience (102:14 - 102:20)
um and since then she I'm jealous since (102:17 - 102:22)
then she's kind of off cuz she preferred (102:20 - 102:25)
playing on the TV I see as opposed to (102:22 - 102:27)
the handheld like we got her for you and (102:25 - 102:29)
she just was like I just wish this one (102:27 - 102:32)
was on the TV so her big complaint is (102:29 - 102:34)
she just wants to hold a controller (102:32 - 102:38)
which it's understandable yeah I get it (102:34 - 102:39)
there's there's definitely that (102:38 - 102:40)
preference there but no I'm a little (102:39 - 102:42)
jealous and I say that only because when (102:40 - 102:46)
I got into 3G Japan was at least the at (102:42 - 102:49)
work like the the the people who who (102:46 - 102:51)
generally played Monster Hunter I think (102:49 - 102:53)
3G ended up getting a lot of new players (102:51 - 102:55)
cuz a lot of the people who had played (102:53 - 102:57)
portable 3D or Freedom Unite they were a (102:55 - 102:59)
little burnt out from the franchise so I (102:57 - 103:01)
could find nobody to play with so I (102:59 - 103:04)
actually had to do I I went all the way (103:01 - 103:07)
through G rank solo and that was that (103:04 - 103:10)
tested my patience and uh it made me a (103:07 - 103:11)
good Hunter I mean in HD sight I'm (103:10 - 103:14)
really happy I did it but oh man without (103:11 - 103:15)
playing being able to play with somebody (103:14 - 103:18)
that was rough I I wish I had a similar (103:15 - 103:20)
story to that but I I always fall under (103:18 - 103:23)
the the never hitting G (103:20 - 103:26)
rank I think I put I think I put close (103:23 - 103:28)
to 250 hours which is probably not (103:26 - 103:31)
nearly as much as other people put into (103:28 - 103:34)
monster amount though uh and I hit I hit (103:31 - 103:37)
hun rank8 and the only reason that I (103:34 - 103:40)
never hit G almost there I I know I was (103:37 - 103:41)
almost there the only reason I never hit (103:40 - 103:43)
G is because I kept introducing new (103:41 - 103:46)
people and so I kept starting back over (103:43 - 103:48)
yeah I kept going back and helping and (103:46 - 103:50)
like I have no like I do not feel like (103:48 - 103:52)
my time was wasted to doing that like it (103:50 - 103:54)
was still super enjoyable but I never (103:52 - 103:57)
got the experience of of G and I just (103:54 - 104:01)
hit I think con of rank four or five in (103:57 - 104:04)
generations and I loved I I I have a lot (104:01 - 104:07)
of complaints about Monster Hunter 4u (104:04 - 104:09)
but Generations I feel like fixed a lot (104:07 - 104:11)
of those yeah yeah for for you was (104:09 - 104:14)
really good I think at at at introducing (104:11 - 104:16)
new people to the series I think the way (104:14 - 104:17)
that they set it up and everything the (104:16 - 104:19)
flow is really much better than it was (104:17 - 104:21)
back in the previous games but (104:19 - 104:22)
Generations just assumes that you're a (104:21 - 104:24)
veteran and just throws you in there and (104:22 - 104:26)
and it's great as a hunting tool it's (104:24 - 104:29)
it's fantastic I was going to ask uh (104:26 - 104:32)
what what is your take with the lack of (104:29 - 104:34)
instruction in the game I think we both (104:32 - 104:38)
can relate to to 3u of they don't tell (104:34 - 104:40)
you anything they don't tell you (104:38 - 104:42)
anything and the start is so sluggish (104:40 - 104:44)
and it's even worse cuz they start you (104:42 - 104:45)
off with a weapon that they assume you (104:44 - 104:47)
know you need upgrade before you (104:45 - 104:49)
actually go and Hunt something but (104:47 - 104:50)
there's no one to tell you that so (104:49 - 104:52)
you're like like like you said you're up (104:50 - 104:53)
against this honey bear and you're (104:52 - 104:55)
hitting it and hitting it and hitting it (104:53 - 104:57)
and it's nothing's happening and you're (104:55 - 104:59)
like it's not dying and the game just (104:57 - 105:02)
fails to say hey I just taught you how (104:59 - 105:03)
to gather materials why don't you look (105:02 - 105:05)
at what you need to upgrade your sword (105:03 - 105:07)
and shield and upgrade it once and then (105:05 - 105:09)
you'll be able to kick some butts you (105:07 - 105:11)
know but the game does nothing um so I (105:09 - 105:14)
think foru did a much much better job (105:11 - 105:15)
and I was really happy with that I think (105:14 - 105:18)
that if they you know on like mon 5 or (105:15 - 105:20)
whatever they're working on next they (105:18 - 105:22)
they really if they want to bring in new (105:20 - 105:24)
players they need to do what they didn't (105:22 - 105:27)
for you if not more but Generations is (105:24 - 105:29)
is obviously targeted at just serious (105:27 - 105:31)
veterans who want to experience all the (105:29 - 105:33)
different generations of the game so (105:31 - 105:36)
they completely stripped out a lot of (105:33 - 105:37)
the tuto I mean the tutorial are there (105:36 - 105:40)
but they're kind of buried in like text (105:37 - 105:41)
um and for those who read it they're (105:40 - 105:44)
really good but I think it's back to 3u (105:41 - 105:45)
time where it's a little hard to play (105:44 - 105:47)
but luckily enough they took out all the (105:45 - 105:49)
fluffs so you're not sitting there you (105:47 - 105:50)
know delivering eggs and gather (105:49 - 105:52)
Gathering ferns for you know the first (105:50 - 105:54)
four hours of the game (105:52 - 105:57)
so I think they did a fantastic job in (105:54 - 106:00)
in fixing the pacing um but it does kind (105:57 - 106:03)
of just throw you in there yeah and that (106:00 - 106:07)
kind of comes to so really No Lack no (106:03 - 106:08)
they're not good at telling you what to (106:07 - 106:12)
do but in in my eyes I had to go seek (106:08 - 106:15)
that out on YouTube and that's where I (106:12 - 106:17)
found you in your videos I guess that's (106:15 - 106:19)
it's it's a good thing and a bad thing (106:17 - 106:20)
right I think maybe I think in Japan (106:19 - 106:23)
there's this idea that if a game has a (106:20 - 106:26)
lot of depth then it's more detrimental (106:23 - 106:28)
to try to shove it down people's throats (106:26 - 106:29)
and then they go whoo this game is too (106:28 - 106:32)
complicated for me um and better to just (106:29 - 106:33)
let them play at the surface and if they (106:32 - 106:35)
want to go deep then it breeds the (106:33 - 106:38)
community mentality of Let's help out (106:35 - 106:40)
each other I guess you sort of see that (106:38 - 106:41)
in the west with the souls games right (106:40 - 106:43)
like they don't horribly explain a lot (106:41 - 106:46)
and people just immediately when they're (106:43 - 106:47)
interested to say I want to know a (106:46 - 106:49)
little bit more about this they go (106:47 - 106:50)
online and everybody's talking about (106:49 - 106:52)
everything so um it breeds more (106:50 - 106:55)
communication and and sharing right so (106:52 - 106:56)
it's it's a good thing and it's a bad (106:55 - 106:59)
thing I think they need to do more um (106:56 - 107:01)
however I do love the idea that there's (106:59 - 107:04)
plenty of room to try to help people and (107:01 - 107:06)
and if it helps somebody then that makes (107:04 - 107:09)
my day worth it so what was what was (107:06 - 107:11)
your initial thought or your initial (107:09 - 107:14)
reason of you sitting down and making (107:11 - 107:16)
the videos that you made yeah so this is (107:14 - 107:18)
kind of weird so like I was doing I (107:16 - 107:20)
started doing blogging when I was into (107:18 - 107:22)
3G um and then going to four it wasn't (107:20 - 107:24)
for anybody no one was reading my blog (107:22 - 107:27)
it was literally just me writing to (107:24 - 107:30)
nobody um but I I wanted to say okay I (107:27 - 107:32)
really love this weapon you know there's (107:30 - 107:34)
so many things about it and I think the (107:32 - 107:36)
game producer and me said well how do (107:34 - 107:39)
you take so many complicated Concepts (107:36 - 107:40)
and reorganize it in a way that it (107:39 - 107:42)
sounds like hey I could do that so I (107:40 - 107:45)
started writing text tutorials and I (107:42 - 107:47)
actually got I think like 300 followers (107:45 - 107:50)
on Tumblr um after about a year or so of (107:47 - 107:52)
doing so and I think one of the people (107:50 - 107:53)
was asking me about hey why don't you (107:52 - 107:54)
show us off some of the cool new stuff (107:53 - 107:57)
in M Hunter 4 I was like yeah it's (107:54 - 107:58)
probably pretty good idea so I just (107:57 - 108:01)
grabbed my iPhone and I just recorded a (107:58 - 108:03)
few like really bad I just recorded a (108:01 - 108:04)
few like videos and put them on a (108:03 - 108:07)
YouTube channel um and I I was so (108:04 - 108:09)
excited because I I got like you know 50 (108:07 - 108:11)
likes I was like Wow 50 views on my (108:09 - 108:13)
video and people people enjoyed it they (108:11 - 108:15)
thought it was cool so I was really (108:13 - 108:17)
happy but then it started getting to a (108:15 - 108:20)
point where I I really wanted to help (108:17 - 108:21)
other people (108:20 - 108:23)
um and I knew that my tutorials would be (108:21 - 108:26)
better as videos and then it was just so (108:23 - 108:27)
happened that I you know the investment (108:26 - 108:30)
is huge if you want to do 3DS streaming (108:27 - 108:31)
you've got (108:30 - 108:34)
$250 or more for a capture card MH um (108:31 - 108:36)
and I got really lucky because I was (108:34 - 108:37)
when I was debating making that (108:36 - 108:39)
investment cuz I knew I'd never get that (108:37 - 108:42)
money back there was like a uh what do (108:39 - 108:44)
you call like a Humble Bundle with (108:42 - 108:46)
Camtasia and I was like ooh video (108:44 - 108:47)
editing software I was like okay you (108:46 - 108:49)
know what I got Camtasia for like 10 (108:47 - 108:52)
bucks went ahead and and invested and (108:49 - 108:54)
made the videos and I was right like (108:52 - 108:56)
it's it was the right medium for what I (108:54 - 108:59)
was trying to do um and then you know I (108:56 - 109:01)
just it was kind of funny cuz at first I (108:59 - 109:02)
was a little terrified I was like I'm (109:01 - 109:04)
going to make 12 weapon tutorials and (109:02 - 109:07)
then I'm done because there's you know (109:04 - 109:09)
once you know that what else is there (109:07 - 109:10)
right right right right but lo and (109:09 - 109:12)
behold you know after I finished for 12 (109:10 - 109:14)
there was plenty of room to talk about (109:12 - 109:16)
other stuff um and you know and (109:14 - 109:18)
obviously with the release of for you my (109:16 - 109:21)
channel shot up really fast so (109:18 - 109:23)
being able to interact and help people (109:21 - 109:24)
is (109:23 - 109:26)
is I I mean I suppose when you're in (109:24 - 109:28)
love you want to tell everybody right so (109:26 - 109:30)
I just want to share the love um and I (109:28 - 109:32)
get no greater enjoyment than you know (109:30 - 109:34)
reading the comments and someone saying (109:32 - 109:36)
like I didn't get it but now this clicks (109:34 - 109:37)
I really enjoyed it and I had a lot of (109:36 - 109:40)
fun this weekend like that's awesome (109:37 - 109:42)
because you know that's that's what I (109:40 - 109:44)
enjoy so much about the series really (109:42 - 109:46)
this was your like first attempt at (109:44 - 109:48)
making videos and your first attempt at (109:46 - 109:51)
the YouTube thing yes I mean I mean (109:48 - 109:54)
pretty much um I YouTube again I did (109:51 - 109:55)
probably for a half a year I did some (109:54 - 109:57)
really shoddy just quick little camera (109:55 - 110:00)
videos but I knew that I needed to give (109:57 - 110:03)
it an honest effort so to say so yeah (110:00 - 110:04)
I'm I'm very happy with how it worked (110:03 - 110:07)
out um still growing still trying to (110:04 - 110:09)
figure out how to do it right but um (110:07 - 110:10)
like you said I didn't even voice my my (110:09 - 110:12)
videos at first because I didn't even (110:10 - 110:14)
have a microphone I was terrified to (110:12 - 110:17)
talk I I I you know didn't know what I (110:14 - 110:20)
was doing so um eventually I I broke (110:17 - 110:22)
that fear and and got a little bit more (110:20 - 110:23)
confident and then I had some really (110:22 - 110:25)
horribly God you go back to some of my (110:23 - 110:27)
older videos and the audio is really bad (110:25 - 110:30)
I'm like hi guys this is AD (110:27 - 110:32)
don't and in my head I was being super (110:30 - 110:35)
energetic and I was being I was just (110:32 - 110:37)
trying to talk in a in a tone or a speed (110:35 - 110:39)
that was easier to listen to and of (110:37 - 110:40)
course you don't realize it when you (110:39 - 110:43)
hear yourself but man was it awful you (110:40 - 110:44)
know but eventually I got a little bit (110:43 - 110:45)
better I'm still trying to get better at (110:44 - 110:48)
it but uh oh it's been a it's been so I (110:45 - 110:50)
think I make YouTube videos not only (110:48 - 110:52)
because because they really help people (110:50 - 110:54)
but they also help me as well I feel (110:52 - 110:56)
that I'm growing as a as a hunter and (110:54 - 110:59)
I'm also learning a lot about creating (110:56 - 111:00)
media and that's that's awesome so it's (110:59 - 111:03)
a win-win for every for for everything (111:00 - 111:06)
yeah yeah definitely I mean I've been (111:03 - 111:09)
doing this show for six years and yeah I (111:06 - 111:11)
was going to ask what what what got you (111:09 - 111:13)
started into to wanting to do it this (111:11 - 111:16)
show um mostly I was I was huge into (111:13 - 111:19)
podcast I listened to a ton of them and (111:16 - 111:21)
I was there there was a video game (111:19 - 111:23)
podcast I used to listen to all the time (111:21 - 111:25)
it was called it was called oneup yours (111:23 - 111:26)
and then I think they changed their name (111:25 - 111:30)
to weaken confirmed what up yours um but (111:26 - 111:32)
it was it was the people from 1up.com (111:30 - 111:35)
which was like I think some people from (111:32 - 111:37)
84 play used to work with them if I'm (111:35 - 111:40)
not mistaken it's it's all that old (111:37 - 111:42)
Community is somewhat intermixed yeah (111:40 - 111:44)
yeah I wouldn't doubt it you know every (111:42 - 111:45)
week they cover the games they play and (111:44 - 111:48)
stuff like uh John Davidson gardet Lee (111:45 - 111:51)
all those guys and (111:48 - 111:53)
heart gold soul silver the Pokemon games (111:51 - 111:54)
came out and I was like oh they're going (111:53 - 111:56)
to talk about it I can't wait you know I (111:54 - 111:57)
love Pokemon blah blah blah and they (111:56 - 111:58)
they they skipped it they didn't they (111:57 - 112:00)
didn't cover it at all and it was like (111:58 - 112:01)
oh (112:00 - 112:04)
like like how could they not talk about (112:01 - 112:05)
these games like Pokemon games are best (112:04 - 112:07)
sellers every like the month they come (112:05 - 112:09)
out they're they're number one you're (112:07 - 112:13)
call to duty call to action and uh so I (112:09 - 112:14)
was like well they're probably is a (112:13 - 112:17)
Pokemon specific podcast and there were (112:14 - 112:20)
in iTunes but not most of them were were (112:17 - 112:23)
on Hiatus or haven't recorded or they (112:20 - 112:25)
were sporadic and I like to me I I want (112:23 - 112:28)
something weekly yeah I want that (112:25 - 112:29)
consistency so I was like I just I'll (112:28 - 112:33)
just start it and try it and going going (112:29 - 112:35)
off what you said about listening to (112:33 - 112:36)
older stuff and like oh like you didn't (112:35 - 112:39)
sound energetic like I felt the same way (112:36 - 112:41)
in in my older episodes like I've got (112:39 - 112:42)
here's a like a pro tip for people (112:41 - 112:44)
wanting to create content especially (112:42 - 112:47)
like audio content is like definitely (112:44 - 112:49)
listen to your old (112:47 - 112:53)
stuff and I I I I'm a strong believer of (112:49 - 112:54)
your (112:53 - 112:56)
equipment might not be the most (112:54 - 112:58)
important thing when you're starting but (112:56 - 113:01)
I think that it does matter in in the (112:58 - 113:04)
aspect of confidence it's just like uh (113:01 - 113:07)
true you going to like a formal event (113:04 - 113:09)
you could put on jeans and a shirt and (113:07 - 113:11)
or like you you feel more confident like (113:09 - 113:13)
looking really good I mean I guess (113:11 - 113:14)
that's why people dress up for like (113:13 - 113:15)
really interesting point actually I (113:14 - 113:16)
never thought about that because when I (113:15 - 113:18)
first started doing audio I was (113:16 - 113:19)
literally talking into my iPhone with (113:18 - 113:23)
the with the mic app I had so bad but (113:19 - 113:25)
you're right you if if if you're (113:23 - 113:27)
slouched over and and you and you feel (113:25 - 113:29)
like you're hacking it then it it makes (113:27 - 113:32)
it a little harder to to feel confident (113:29 - 113:35)
and and just blow out the horn so to say (113:32 - 113:37)
yeah yeah and it was funny cuz we were (113:35 - 113:40)
talking about audio software before um (113:37 - 113:42)
and I went through so many different (113:40 - 113:43)
versions of different audio softwares (113:42 - 113:46)
but like the the stuff I use now it's I (113:43 - 113:48)
know it works I it makes my workflow (113:46 - 113:50)
better it's great like I feel like like (113:48 - 113:52)
I'm never like oh I got to use this (113:50 - 113:54)
program and like no one ever wants to (113:52 - 113:56)
feel that when they're trying to make (113:54 - 113:58)
something look yeah I enjoy making (113:56 - 114:00)
content so I'm glad that the software (113:58 - 114:02)
and stuff I use is also like enjoyable (114:00 - 114:04)
to use now if only they made it easier (114:02 - 114:07)
to capture 3DS huh right right yes (114:04 - 114:10)
exactly what motivates you to keep (114:07 - 114:14)
making YouTube content I mean you you (114:10 - 114:17)
have a day job yeah you obviously put a (114:14 - 114:19)
lot of hours into Monster Hunter but I'm (114:17 - 114:22)
sure that you would have even more free (114:19 - 114:26)
time not recording editing voice overing (114:22 - 114:28)
all that stuff it eats a lot of time (114:26 - 114:31)
especially I know the video time I I I (114:28 - 114:32)
I'm this month I'm sort of unofficially (114:31 - 114:35)
taking time off just because it's been (114:32 - 114:36)
really busy on my other job and I'm a (114:35 - 114:38)
little burnt out so I said okay I'm not (114:36 - 114:39)
going to commit to anything this month (114:38 - 114:41)
even though I do find myself making (114:39 - 114:43)
videos I can't step I can't stay away (114:41 - 114:44)
from (114:43 - 114:47)
it but yeah I spend probably a good I (114:44 - 114:49)
would say 20 30 hours a week uh on (114:47 - 114:51)
YouTube whether it's research or making (114:49 - 114:54)
videos or or doing something but uh I (114:51 - 114:57)
guess when it's your hobby it's never (114:54 - 114:59)
really work I guess that's the best way (114:57 - 115:01)
to put it when you really love what you (114:59 - 115:03)
do it it feels like okay well if I (115:01 - 115:05)
wasn't doing it anyways this is what I (115:03 - 115:07)
want to do it's like my hobby so I think (115:05 - 115:10)
playing Monster Hunter I think creating (115:07 - 115:12)
Monster Hunter content has now become an (115:10 - 115:15)
equal hobby for me um it's really (115:12 - 115:18)
enjoyable for me to to realize the holes (115:15 - 115:20)
of my own knowledge you know when I'm (115:18 - 115:22)
covering something I think even I know (115:20 - 115:24)
and then I do the research I'm like oh I (115:22 - 115:26)
didn't know that like I just did a video (115:24 - 115:29)
the other day on an item the the shock (115:26 - 115:31)
the what is it the flashbangs or not the (115:29 - 115:34)
flash the the D Sonic bombs Sonic bomb (115:31 - 115:36)
Sonic bombs and there's a few of them (115:34 - 115:39)
that I sort of knew but I didn't and so (115:36 - 115:41)
the it's not like I just pick up the 3DS (115:39 - 115:43)
record and boom there it is you know (115:41 - 115:44)
like I I have to do research for that (115:43 - 115:46)
stuff and make sure I'm not missing any (115:44 - 115:49)
really big ones and I'm human so I make (115:46 - 115:51)
some mistakes but but um I learn as I (115:49 - 115:53)
make those I was like oh I didn't quite (115:51 - 115:54)
really understood it it went that far (115:53 - 115:57)
that's pretty cool so to me it's it's (115:54 - 115:59)
the same as learning and playing m (115:57 - 116:02)
Hunter as I'm as I'm teaching I guess to (115:59 - 116:04)
to truly learn you have to teach so to (116:02 - 116:06)
say so it's it's an (116:04 - 116:10)
addiction sure uh speaking of teaching (116:06 - 116:13)
sleep right right yes overrated sleep (116:10 - 116:15)
three hours a day you're (116:13 - 116:20)
fine how what advice or at this point in (116:15 - 116:23)
time how would somebody new get into (116:20 - 116:27)
Monster Hunter I feel like even with all (116:23 - 116:29)
the progressions of the game and making (116:27 - 116:32)
it easier and yeah it's still a daunting (116:29 - 116:35)
game it is I mean it's it's horrible to (116:32 - 116:37)
say this at first because some people (116:35 - 116:38)
might be like I don't have that so okay (116:37 - 116:40)
then it's not for me but I would say if (116:38 - 116:42)
ideally the best way to get into monster (116:40 - 116:44)
hunter is with a friend if you have a (116:42 - 116:46)
friend who knows Monster Hunter just (116:44 - 116:47)
getting your hand held and and just (116:46 - 116:50)
being with someone who gets the game for (116:47 - 116:52)
just even a few hours I think is is more (116:50 - 116:54)
than enough to understand the mentality (116:52 - 116:55)
that you go into the game and I think (116:54 - 116:57)
then you can be thrown off on your own (116:55 - 116:59)
and do pretty good um obviously there's (116:57 - 117:01)
a lot of content on the internet not (116:59 - 117:03)
just my videos but a lot of guides and (117:01 - 117:05)
and other very you know passionate (117:03 - 117:08)
videos of of people talking about it and (117:05 - 117:10)
I keep meaning to do it but I it's just (117:08 - 117:11)
it's so daunting to me is I know (117:10 - 117:14)
projared um made an made a really nice (117:11 - 117:17)
attempt to do it as well maybe not an (117:14 - 117:19)
attempt he actually pulled it off um but (117:17 - 117:20)
like sort of like the welcome the master (117:19 - 117:22)
hunter video series like how do how do (117:20 - 117:24)
you play this game but it's like the (117:22 - 117:25)
Holy Grail it's like I don't even know (117:24 - 117:27)
how to approach it but I think yeah (117:25 - 117:30)
ideally going in with another players is (117:27 - 117:33)
great if not then I would say I don't (117:30 - 117:34)
know just watch some videos of people (117:33 - 117:36)
playing um I think I sometimes it gives (117:34 - 117:38)
a good idea of you know monkey see (117:36 - 117:40)
monkey do and you get an idea like oh (117:38 - 117:42)
this isn't Devil May Cry it's not a beat (117:40 - 117:45)
them up game you know it's this is a (117:42 - 117:47)
game about planning and doing this and I (117:45 - 117:49)
guess another piece of advice I would (117:47 - 117:50)
love to give people if they're listening (117:49 - 117:51)
and they're thinking about monster (117:50 - 117:52)
hunter is remembering that like any (117:51 - 117:54)
really good game that has a lot of (117:52 - 117:57)
weapons and classes so to say your (117:54 - 117:58)
experience with the game changes greatly (117:57 - 118:00)
depending on what weapon you're using (117:58 - 118:02)
and I know a lot of people will go into (118:00 - 118:04)
the game and try like the great swword (118:02 - 118:05)
because that's what they sell in (118:04 - 118:07)
marketing material right big ass sword (118:05 - 118:08)
you know I'm sorry I don't even know if (118:07 - 118:10)
I could say that on your podcast it's (118:08 - 118:13)
fine we do like little Pokemon sounds of (118:10 - 118:15)
uh if if you swear so it's people (118:13 - 118:17)
usually actually like it cuz then it's (118:15 - 118:20)
funny but you know and and you you don't (118:17 - 118:22)
like it and then people this game's not (118:20 - 118:23)
for me well that's not true you know (118:22 - 118:25)
it's it's like playing as a mage and (118:23 - 118:27)
then going in as a knight you know it's (118:25 - 118:28)
it changes everything so I'd say give it (118:27 - 118:31)
a shot try everything hopefully (118:28 - 118:32)
hopefully it clicks but you know like (118:31 - 118:34)
any game it's not for everybody um but I (118:32 - 118:36)
definitely think if you like Dark Souls (118:34 - 118:39)
if you like Pokemon if if you could be a (118:36 - 118:41)
little patient and and and love a game (118:39 - 118:43)
that goes deep then I think you know it (118:41 - 118:47)
could be for you yeah we we had uh a lot (118:43 - 118:50)
more people jump on in in (118:47 - 118:53)
the slack community that we have of of (118:50 - 118:56)
generations and the first thing I kind (118:53 - 118:59)
of set up was like before you commit to (118:56 - 119:00)
anything just go through every single (118:59 - 119:03)
weapon and try it out yeah see what (119:00 - 119:05)
feels like it might be fun to use right (119:03 - 119:06)
right and especially because you're (119:05 - 119:08)
going to put all this time into the game (119:06 - 119:10)
you want you probably have a different (119:08 - 119:12)
because you put so many hours in but I (119:10 - 119:14)
feel like a somebody who's maybe like a (119:12 - 119:16)
casual or just I they play Monster (119:14 - 119:17)
Hunter you know once or twice a week (119:16 - 119:18)
they're probably not going to be (119:17 - 119:20)
switching weapons that often they're (119:18 - 119:22)
only going to play one weapon um yeah if (119:20 - 119:24)
if if anything a second one I think (119:22 - 119:25)
that's actually not even just the light (119:24 - 119:27)
I think that's the the M as well most (119:25 - 119:30)
people only play one to two weapons so (119:27 - 119:31)
finding something you like is is (119:30 - 119:34)
critical in in falling in love and I I (119:31 - 119:36)
think that once the game feels like (119:34 - 119:38)
there's not much more to else to do (119:36 - 119:39)
switching up to another weapon is like (119:38 - 119:42)
getting a brand new game it's like here (119:39 - 119:44)
we go here's another 300 hours then you (119:42 - 119:46)
go into the next 11 here's another 300 (119:44 - 119:50)
hours you know so it doesn't quite end (119:46 - 119:53)
for Generations they introduced uh both (119:50 - 119:56)
arts and styles to the game oh yeah uh (119:53 - 119:59)
what are I it gives the game a different (119:56 - 120:01)
feel definitely I'm a little worried if (119:59 - 120:03)
they if they don't include as I know (120:01 - 120:05)
this is technically a spin-off title for (120:03 - 120:08)
Generation it's not a numbered title um (120:05 - 120:10)
it's it's meant to be sort of like a a (120:08 - 120:12)
celebration of all things Monster Hunter (120:10 - 120:14)
um it it kind of I don't know how I'm (120:12 - 120:16)
going to feel if the next big game (120:14 - 120:19)
doesn't have styles I'm so it feels so (120:16 - 120:20)
right (120:19 - 120:22)
than that um I I don't know it would (120:20 - 120:25)
feel really awkward for me so you're a a (120:22 - 120:28)
fan of that change then huge fan yes (120:25 - 120:30)
because I mean from a tutorial (120:28 - 120:31)
perspective it's it get it's kind of (120:30 - 120:33)
weird when you're making a tutorial for (120:31 - 120:34)
a past Monster Hunter game and you (120:33 - 120:36)
realize there's the way to use the (120:34 - 120:39)
weapon and then everybody who Masters (120:36 - 120:41)
the weapon are pretty much all doing the (120:39 - 120:43)
same thing and that's fine and the game (120:41 - 120:46)
is really fun but until we really got to (120:43 - 120:47)
experience Styles and then going into a (120:46 - 120:49)
hunt with other people with the same (120:47 - 120:50)
weapon and see seen that everyone has (120:49 - 120:52)
their own take on it and can play it (120:50 - 120:54)
differently and if you're playing it (120:52 - 120:56)
differently you don't go that guy (120:54 - 120:57)
doesn't know what he's doing it's like (120:56 - 120:59)
no maybe he has a different you know (120:57 - 121:01)
setup maybe he has different style maybe (120:59 - 121:02)
he has different arts and he's going for (121:01 - 121:05)
a different approach and you can do that (121:02 - 121:06)
and I think that's a key thing for the (121:05 - 121:08)
West as well is being able to you know (121:06 - 121:10)
put your own personality into how you (121:08 - 121:13)
hunt and I it just feels so right um and (121:10 - 121:16)
I love the idea of experimentation and (121:13 - 121:18)
and uh not being horribly punished for (121:16 - 121:20)
trying out new things right which yeah (121:18 - 121:22)
the game's a little bit more LAX than (121:20 - 121:24)
for you was in that regard um the (121:22 - 121:26)
difficulty has been toned in a way that (121:24 - 121:28)
you know if you try something new you're (121:26 - 121:29)
not just going to pound it in the ground (121:28 - 121:31)
right away you know so it's fun to (121:29 - 121:33)
experiment so for a new person would you (121:31 - 121:36)
have them start with for you or 3u or (121:33 - 121:39)
Generations or where it's it's that's a (121:36 - 121:41)
tough one cuz I I get asked that a lot (121:39 - 121:43)
Generations is by far the best monster (121:41 - 121:46)
hunter game uh from gameplay wise I I I (121:43 - 121:47)
I can't see how any other game really (121:46 - 121:49)
compares to it except with the Nostalgia (121:47 - 121:52)
factor maybe if you're going into it for (121:49 - 121:54)
story though you're not going to get any (121:52 - 121:56)
so I think people who are interested in (121:54 - 121:57)
story and maybe slowly getting into the (121:56 - 121:59)
game and having a little bit more (121:57 - 122:01)
handheld picking up a cheap copy of for (121:59 - 122:03)
you might be fun and if you really enjoy (122:01 - 122:05)
it then just put it down and get (122:03 - 122:07)
Generations um but Generations if you (122:05 - 122:08)
have a friend you can play with and (122:07 - 122:10)
there's online as well if if you don't (122:08 - 122:13)
mind going in without too much handheld (122:10 - 122:16)
then I think Generations is the best mon (122:13 - 122:19)
experience you're going to get by far (122:16 - 122:22)
I'm going switch switch 180 degrees is (122:19 - 122:24)
there anything in Monster Hunter you (122:22 - 122:25)
don't (122:24 - 122:28)
like lack of voice chat (122:25 - 122:30)
sucks I mean think of it we all do (122:28 - 122:33)
really Creative Solutions we we use um (122:30 - 122:35)
Skype we use Discord everyone is just (122:33 - 122:37)
trying to communicate with each other I (122:35 - 122:38)
mean granted the fact that there's no (122:37 - 122:41)
voice makes it for some really fun like (122:38 - 122:43)
chat experiences and using motions and (122:41 - 122:44)
Gestures but I think everyone would (122:43 - 122:46)
agree that voice chat would be a very (122:44 - 122:48)
welcome addition cuz it's hard to teach (122:46 - 122:50)
also new players if you're in a room and (122:48 - 122:51)
they're like I don't really know what (122:50 - 122:53)
I'm doing if there was voice and you (122:51 - 122:55)
could really help them out and I think (122:53 - 122:57)
the community can Bond even more so that (122:55 - 123:01)
really annoys me I really enjoyed 3u (122:57 - 123:02)
just like you were saying on the Wii U (123:01 - 123:04)
the experience of being able to to go (123:02 - 123:07)
outside on a handheld and then come home (123:04 - 123:08)
and play it on a big screen was really (123:07 - 123:12)
sweet I would love to have that again (123:08 - 123:14)
some in some form I just it's just I'm a (123:12 - 123:16)
Big Apple fan so it bugs me then you you (123:14 - 123:18)
know you come you have all your data on (123:16 - 123:20)
your iPhone or whatever phone it's it's (123:18 - 123:22)
all synced in the cloud like your save (123:20 - 123:24)
data right mhm you come home and I can (123:22 - 123:25)
just sit down on my computer and (123:24 - 123:28)
continue where I left off imagine if mon (123:25 - 123:29)
Turner was that seamless like if they (123:28 - 123:31)
had an NX thing or something that would (123:29 - 123:34)
be oh who knows what NX even even is but (123:31 - 123:36)
right assuming that as a console because (123:34 - 123:37)
that's where the rumors are pointing (123:36 - 123:39)
like wouldn't that be awesome yeah (123:37 - 123:42)
totally I I it's hard for me to sit on (123:39 - 123:44)
my couch and play my 3DS (123:42 - 123:46)
when like I have screen looking at you (123:44 - 123:49)
going wink wink wink win don't you want (123:46 - 123:51)
to play on me I'll be honest though I (123:49 - 123:54)
live in Japan so my thoughts on the 3DS (123:51 - 123:56)
is definitely biased we're always you (123:54 - 123:57)
know commuting on average is like an (123:56 - 124:00)
hour one way for almost everybody here (123:57 - 124:02)
so being able to sit on a train or stand (124:00 - 124:05)
in a train and play on your 3DS is huge (124:02 - 124:07)
so it it does kind of terrify me that if (124:05 - 124:10)
they take it off from handheld that my (124:07 - 124:13)
play time will suffer as a consequence (124:10 - 124:14)
you know being able to plan on lunch and (124:13 - 124:16)
stuff like that is is really I think (124:14 - 124:18)
important for you know salaried workers (124:16 - 124:21)
in Japan so I I don't know how I'd feel (124:18 - 124:23)
if they stepped away from handheld but (124:21 - 124:25)
honestly I don't care what format is it (124:23 - 124:27)
could be any format I'll still play (124:25 - 124:30)
Monster H I'll love it so it's all good (124:27 - 124:32)
is there still uh is there you paint (124:30 - 124:34)
this picture that everyone on the on the (124:32 - 124:36)
train is playing a 3DS is that in (124:34 - 124:39)
reality true no everyone's on their (124:36 - 124:42)
smartphone in in reality you can't argue (124:39 - 124:44)
that the uh smartphone business has has (124:42 - 124:46)
sto has stealed a good amount of people (124:44 - 124:48)
from the 3DS because they just go on the (124:46 - 124:50)
train and you can see it but um I would (124:48 - 124:52)
say I don't know there's just a lot of (124:50 - 124:54)
times when I see people do play in 3DS (124:52 - 124:55)
whether it's waiting in line for (124:54 - 124:57)
something which you do a lot here in (124:55 - 124:59)
Japan or during their lunch break or (124:57 - 125:00)
something like that you do see people (124:59 - 125:03)
playing their 3DS definitely um but (125:00 - 125:05)
right now the smartphone market is sort (125:03 - 125:08)
of taking over people's time quite a bit (125:05 - 125:10)
and of course Pokemon go yeah totally (125:08 - 125:12)
which also has a monopoly on you know (125:10 - 125:15)
your screen time so that also shuts down (125:12 - 125:17)
any other possibilities so we'll see if (125:15 - 125:19)
the uh the plus will are you going to (125:17 - 125:22)
get a plus yeah I I actually got one um (125:19 - 125:24)
about a week ago and how is it it's (125:22 - 125:26)
great it's super great I uh I plan on (125:24 - 125:28)
doing a review but it's it's not what I (125:26 - 125:31)
thought it was just a real short (125:28 - 125:33)
explanation you start a session on it (125:31 - 125:35)
and that session lasts a half hour so (125:33 - 125:37)
you go into the app you click the (125:35 - 125:40)
Pokémon go plus you verify it by (125:37 - 125:42)
clicking the actual device and then it (125:40 - 125:44)
runs in the background on your phone for (125:42 - 125:47)
a half hour so really you you know how (125:44 - 125:50)
when you close an app on iOS you have (125:47 - 125:52)
the blue bar on the top like oh Maps is (125:50 - 125:54)
up here or Skype is up here it does the (125:52 - 125:57)
same thing with Pokémon go and I see so (125:54 - 125:58)
then when you're moving when you're (125:57 - 126:01)
walking around uh it vibrates when a (125:58 - 126:03)
Pokemon's near and you all you do is hit (126:01 - 126:04)
the button and it either catches it or (126:03 - 126:06)
it doesn't and there's different vibrate (126:04 - 126:08)
feelings for that and then when you're (126:06 - 126:10)
at a poké stop you hit the button and (126:08 - 126:13)
then you're good to go you actually you (126:10 - 126:14)
you shouldn't be using the app at all (126:13 - 126:17)
cuz the plus is handling (126:14 - 126:20)
everything um but I I thought it was (126:17 - 126:21)
something that was going to run all the (126:20 - 126:22)
time or something you needed to charge (126:21 - 126:23)
but there's no charging port there's (126:22 - 126:25)
just a battery in it and yeah you just (126:23 - 126:27)
start a half hour session and you go (126:25 - 126:30)
which I think is actually pretty great (126:27 - 126:32)
um especially if you're walking down the (126:30 - 126:34)
street to the store to a park you can (126:32 - 126:36)
start a session and then you can you can (126:34 - 126:38)
like text or you can look up something (126:36 - 126:41)
in Safari and not worry about that CU (126:38 - 126:42)
that was my problem with Pokemon go is (126:41 - 126:45)
like people are texting me and like I (126:42 - 126:46)
want to interact with anything yeah (126:45 - 126:48)
right cuz I need this app up because if (126:46 - 126:49)
the app's not up and I'm not getting my (126:48 - 126:51)
eggs hatched I'm not checking into Poké (126:49 - 126:53)
stops it's kind of weird though if it's (126:51 - 126:55)
running in the background and the GPS is (126:53 - 126:58)
embedded in the iPhone and not the plus (126:55 - 127:00)
then technically they could update the (126:58 - 127:02)
game so that you could at least have (127:00 - 127:05)
walking maybe not capturing or pokus (127:02 - 127:06)
house but they could technically run in (127:05 - 127:07)
the background so you can have your (127:06 - 127:09)
walking for EG hatching I wonder why (127:07 - 127:11)
they haven't yeah I wonder if that's (127:09 - 127:14)
like a battery life issue or something (127:11 - 127:17)
uh I know in the half hour session that (127:14 - 127:19)
I did uh I (127:17 - 127:22)
I lost 10% battery uh and that was not (127:19 - 127:24)
looking at my phone not doing anything (127:22 - 127:26)
it was just simply I want to test what (127:24 - 127:29)
the battery life is is with this let's (127:26 - 127:30)
start the session and let's and it was (127:29 - 127:33)
10% which yeah it's not not the worst uh (127:30 - 127:37)
for 30 30 minutes of Pokemon go 30 (127:33 - 127:38)
minutes that seems a little restricting (127:37 - 127:40)
but I suppose for people who walk around (127:38 - 127:42)
a lot that's just going to be good yeah (127:40 - 127:43)
yeah cuz it lets you know when the (127:42 - 127:45)
session is over so you can start it (127:43 - 127:48)
again if you want that's good I have to (127:45 - 127:50)
debate getting one maybe they're hard to (127:48 - 127:52)
find right now uh at least in the states (127:50 - 127:53)
yeah in Japan you can't get them (127:52 - 127:55)
anywhere they're totally sold out okay (127:53 - 127:58)
yeah I figur it as much you're uh a (127:55 - 128:00)
couple more questions you're known as (127:58 - 128:02)
obviously the Monster Hunter guy I feel (128:00 - 128:04)
like I'm known everywhere as the Pokemon (128:02 - 128:06)
guy but I I am I confident you have (128:04 - 128:09)
other hobbies and interest outside of (128:06 - 128:10)
monster (128:09 - 128:13)
hunter games or in general H you know (128:10 - 128:16)
both uh I'm I'm super into Destiny (128:13 - 128:18)
that's probably like my my number one (128:16 - 128:21)
game of choice that uh isn't Pokemon or (128:18 - 128:24)
Monster Hunter I I'm a big fan of WWE (128:21 - 128:26)
unfortunately and I watch spend too much (128:24 - 128:28)
time watching wrestling and regretting (128:26 - 128:31)
my time but what about you I mean like (128:28 - 128:33)
besides making stuff besides Monster (128:31 - 128:36)
Hunter besides you know family and work (128:33 - 128:40)
yeah oh man um I'm addicted to believe (128:36 - 128:42)
it or not I'm addicted to just learning (128:40 - 128:44)
in general it's just one of my hobbies (128:42 - 128:47)
that I have a role that I try every day (128:44 - 128:49)
actively to learn learn something before (128:47 - 128:51)
I go to bed like I have to I can't wake (128:49 - 128:53)
up tomorrow with the same experience (128:51 - 128:55)
points as I have today is is how I think (128:53 - 128:57)
about it whether it's stupid trivia or (128:55 - 128:59)
something I got to learn something so (128:57 - 129:01)
I'm on iTunes un University watching (128:59 - 129:04)
videos about computer science about math (129:01 - 129:06)
you name it always trying to learn (129:04 - 129:09)
something um I have I have some parody (129:06 - 129:12)
accounts on Twitter so some people know (129:09 - 129:13)
that I'm a huge fan of Neil degrass (129:12 - 129:17)
Tyson Carl sigan Bill NY you know Brian (129:13 - 129:19)
Green those guys so scien is is (129:17 - 129:21)
definitely a huge inter thing for me in (129:19 - 129:23)
watching videos that that teach about (129:21 - 129:25)
engineering or science and then because (129:23 - 129:27)
I can then take that and explain to my (129:25 - 129:28)
daughter and and she loves it as well (129:27 - 129:30)
and understanding the world around you (129:28 - 129:33)
is just is just what I I enjoy I guess (129:30 - 129:36)
um I did build a my first game PC for (129:33 - 129:38)
the first time ever just recently I plan (129:36 - 129:40)
to do some videos to talk about the (129:38 - 129:42)
experience and and the parts and and (129:40 - 129:44)
what I'm feeling but uh that that was (129:42 - 129:46)
fun so I am looking forward to making (129:44 - 129:49)
some time so I can play some PC games (129:46 - 129:51)
um I was just enjoying the Talos (129:49 - 129:52)
principal which I'm almost done with now (129:51 - 129:56)
that was hugely enjoyable for me and (129:52 - 129:57)
then just Tech stuff I like messing (129:56 - 129:58)
around with tech so whether it's (129:57 - 130:01)
installing beta software for you know a (129:58 - 130:03)
new Os or or messing around with stuff I (130:01 - 130:06)
just I love fiddling and and playing (130:03 - 130:08)
around with stuff cool but game game (130:06 - 130:10)
Wise It's Kind of a mixed bag like I try (130:08 - 130:12)
to play most of the big games just to (130:10 - 130:14)
see how they are you know and if I enjoy (130:12 - 130:16)
them or what they're doing right and it (130:14 - 130:18)
helps me you know in my day job making (130:16 - 130:20)
video games know what are good ideas and (130:18 - 130:22)
what are not and you know possible (130:20 - 130:26)
executions but um outside uh Monster (130:22 - 130:28)
Hunter I mean he takes up so much of my (130:26 - 130:30)
time that uh I really haven't played Too (130:28 - 130:33)
Many Games outside of it over the last (130:30 - 130:35)
few years except you know I'm really big (130:33 - 130:36)
into (130:35 - 130:39)
Neo um and that's the new KO techmo game (130:36 - 130:41)
coming out next February it's like Dark (130:39 - 130:45)
Souls meets Oni Musha meets you know uh (130:41 - 130:48)
Ninja giden it's it's ridiculous it's (130:45 - 130:49)
it's really fun they did an alpha and (130:48 - 130:51)
Beta And I do I think I'm going to be (130:49 - 130:53)
covering that quite a bit um I actually (130:51 - 130:55)
spent about a good four or five hours (130:53 - 130:56)
yesterday (130:55 - 130:59)
researching um one particular Japanese (130:56 - 131:02)
demon just so I can do a lore video so I (130:59 - 131:03)
think that's going to be another fun (131:02 - 131:06)
hobby for me um which will hopefully you (131:03 - 131:07)
know will teach me some more things that (131:06 - 131:08)
I can get better at teaching Monster (131:07 - 131:11)
Hunter but uh I'm very excited for that (131:08 - 131:14)
Horizon excites me I'm almost like the (131:11 - 131:16)
handheld user in Japan who just is now (131:14 - 131:17)
discovering (131:16 - 131:19)
console (131:17 - 131:21)
so like Dark Souls 3 I never played Dark (131:19 - 131:23)
Souls I tried two and I didn't like it (131:21 - 131:25)
um three I absolutely adored um so I (131:23 - 131:27)
played that through and blood born I (131:25 - 131:29)
absolutely loved I I suppose I'm I'm (131:27 - 131:30)
into a little bit of everything except (131:29 - 131:33)
for maybe not sports games um or games (131:30 - 131:36)
that require a lot of time like um some (131:33 - 131:39)
of the adventure games that uh with a (131:36 - 131:41)
lot of puzzle solving that just I don't (131:39 - 131:43)
know I get I say I'm easily distracted (131:41 - 131:44)
but yet here I go and sit down for 7 (131:43 - 131:46)
hours farming one monster and Monster (131:44 - 131:49)
Hunter so I suppose it's s (131:46 - 131:52)
objective there's that there's that loot (131:49 - 131:54)
mentality that always oh actually you (131:52 - 131:55)
know what there was a second Pokemon (131:54 - 131:58)
game I played religiously um Pokemon on (131:55 - 132:01)
the 3DS had the Rumble game oh yeah yeah (131:58 - 132:02)
yeah where they're like little robot (132:01 - 132:05)
toys and you collect them that game I (132:02 - 132:09)
100% it I played it to death I went nuts (132:05 - 132:12)
on it um that was really fun so they (132:09 - 132:13)
made another one of those I think I'd be (132:12 - 132:14)
all over it I thought you were going to (132:13 - 132:16)
say Shuffle too bad Nintendo doesn't (132:14 - 132:18)
really want you to make videos on their (132:16 - 132:22)
games right yeah that's unfortunate um (132:18 - 132:22)
yeah I thought you were going to say (132:22 - 132:24)
Pokemon Shuffle I feel like that's kind (132:22 - 132:27)
of the one game that also broke bro (132:24 - 132:29)
Shuffle is the pzz like the puzzle and (132:27 - 132:31)
dragons ones oh okay not that not that (132:29 - 132:34)
yeah uh but no Rumble is the the little (132:31 - 132:36)
mechanical toy ones yeah yeah that g was (132:34 - 132:40)
so fun oh my god do do you and even your (132:36 - 132:42)
daughter now getting into Pokemon do do (132:40 - 132:44)
you guys have a favorite Pokemon um for (132:42 - 132:48)
me I suppose I'm not seasoned enough in (132:44 - 132:49)
the game to really know them well enough (132:48 - 132:51)
I do I'm a huge fan of all the Ghost (132:49 - 132:53)
Pokemon it's like my thing sort of (132:51 - 132:55)
hearkens back to like I was into more (132:53 - 132:57)
goth stuff when I was in high school so (132:55 - 132:58)
to say so I love the ghost I love (132:57 - 133:00)
anything that's I love horror movies you (132:58 - 133:02)
know I mean I had a subscription to (133:00 - 133:04)
fangoria like you know that's that's my (133:02 - 133:06)
thing I love it (133:04 - 133:09)
so Del Toro fan you know so the Ghost (133:06 - 133:12)
Pokemon I love um but the one I if I had (133:09 - 133:14)
a favorite it' probably be Victini I (133:12 - 133:15)
think that's what I mean that's what (133:14 - 133:16)
he's called in Japanese I have no idea (133:15 - 133:18)
what he's called same name (133:16 - 133:21)
okay cuz when I first started Pokemon (133:18 - 133:23)
that was Pokemon Black I couldn't care (133:21 - 133:25)
less about the starting Pokemon they all (133:23 - 133:27)
seemed totally boring to me I know I'm (133:25 - 133:30)
going to get some hate for that one um (133:27 - 133:31)
what's wrong with this guy go back to (133:30 - 133:36)
Monster Hunter my pork chop is (133:31 - 133:36)
awesome but early in the game you get (133:36 - 133:40)
over by I never by the water you you can (133:38 - 133:43)
get Victini yes and that to me was my (133:40 - 133:46)
starting Pokemon and I used Victini for (133:43 - 133:48)
a very long time in that game (133:46 - 133:50)
so to me like that was my starting (133:48 - 133:53)
Pokemon so it it has a special place in (133:50 - 133:56)
my heart Victini um my daughter's (133:53 - 133:58)
playing uh XY and she picked the one (133:56 - 134:01)
with uh it has sort of like the a cute (133:58 - 134:02)
hat and like almost like grass and green (134:01 - 134:04)
on him I have no idea what his name (134:02 - 134:07)
grass and green he's he's he looks like (134:04 - 134:10)
a grass Pokemon or something like that a (134:07 - 134:13)
grass type I'm sorry probably Chespin um (134:10 - 134:15)
I think so yes yeah cuz she was (134:13 - 134:17)
complaining that his evolved his second (134:15 - 134:19)
evolved form he's as cute as his first (134:17 - 134:21)
one yeah he turns asking if there's a (134:19 - 134:23)
way to bring him back he turns into like (134:21 - 134:26)
a little chubby Hedgehog (134:23 - 134:29)
exactly yeah chest but she she really (134:26 - 134:30)
likes him because that's her but she (134:29 - 134:33)
also likes um pudding which is in (134:30 - 134:36)
English Jigglypuff oh okay oh yeah (134:33 - 134:38)
that's like so weird that you guys have (134:36 - 134:40)
slightly different names for certain (134:38 - 134:41)
pokem it's kill me because if I'm (134:40 - 134:44)
playing it in Japanese I'm going to (134:41 - 134:46)
start learning all the names in Japanese (134:44 - 134:47)
and I won't know what the heck they're (134:46 - 134:49)
called in English which is what it where (134:47 - 134:51)
I'm at right now I have no idea yeah (134:49 - 134:53)
some names trans some names are exactly (134:51 - 134:55)
the same like Pikachu and Victini but (134:53 - 134:57)
yeah they don't do that for I'm totally (134:55 - 135:00)
going for the cat for uh for um oh Sun (134:57 - 135:02)

she's going to pick that one as her (135:20 - 135:23)
starter yeah I actually might go with (135:22 - 135:26)
Papo too just because I'm a big cat cat (135:23 - 135:28)
person I have three cats here so lton to (135:26 - 135:31)

wor about L though like I it's cute but (135:31 - 135:34)
I'm a little worried that it's going to (135:33 - 135:37)
turn into some husky non- cute evolved (135:34 - 135:39)
form yeah yeah that's I'm I'm getting (135:37 - 135:41)
worried we're getting close to game (135:39 - 135:42)
release and they haven't shown what they (135:41 - 135:43)
evolve into and I feel like that's going (135:42 - 135:47)
to cement my choice exactly because it's (135:43 - 135:48)
like you're only gonna look at that (135:47 - 135:51)
starting form for so long right right I (135:48 - 135:53)
gota ask Pokemon go which team are you (135:51 - 135:56)
uh I am Mystic Mystic uh oh don't tell (135:53 - 135:58)
my daughter that uh oh what team are you (135:56 - 136:00)
guys we're Team Valor okay it was (135:58 - 136:03)
hilarious cuz we went to a water park as (136:00 - 136:05)
a day trip uh not a day trip but like a (136:03 - 136:07)
weekend trip me and my daughter to go (136:05 - 136:10)
swimming and we were in the hotel and we (136:07 - 136:11)
get into an elevator and there was (136:10 - 136:13)
another father and two of his sons (136:11 - 136:15)
playing Pokémon go she looks and she's (136:13 - 136:17)
she's totally not shy so she'll just (136:15 - 136:19)
talk to anybody so she goes oh are you (136:17 - 136:20)
playing Pokémon go and they're like yeah (136:19 - 136:22)
yeah yeah oh you play as well she's like (136:20 - 136:25)
yeah yeah and she's like what color are (136:22 - 136:27)
you what team are you and then they were (136:25 - 136:29)
saying oh we're we're Team blue we're (136:27 - 136:31)
Team Mystic and then she looked at the (136:29 - 136:32)
screen and you can tell that the gym for (136:31 - 136:35)
that hotel was team Mystic and then she (136:32 - 136:36)
in a very adorable voice in Japanese (136:35 - 136:39)
told them later on tonight we're going (136:36 - 136:41)
to take your (136:39 - 136:41)
gym and sure enough when we got back to (136:41 - 136:45)
the hotel first thing she says is we got (136:44 - 136:48)
to take the gym back I like okay so we (136:45 - 136:51)
we we took it and she was so happy she's (136:48 - 136:52)
like I want to go to sleep knowing that (136:51 - 136:53)
the gym is team Valor I was like good (136:52 - 136:55)
girl she's like there's so many team (136:53 - 136:57)
Mystics here in Japan we we got to (136:55 - 136:58)
represent this team Mystic is huge I (136:57 - 137:00)
don't know about the west but it's huge (136:58 - 137:02)
here in Japan yeah I think it's still (137:00 - 137:05)
the biggest team worldwide (137:02 - 137:08)
um I I don't know people get like the (137:05 - 137:11)
color of blue I think that's what it is (137:08 - 137:13)
I think I I I just liked Articuno out of (137:11 - 137:14)
the three birds we have the cooler (137:13 - 137:18)
leader but uh everybody likes blue for (137:14 - 137:20)
I I just made my choice off with which (137:18 - 137:23)
of the legendary birds I liked the best (137:20 - 137:24)
I also think I I'm almost going to guess (137:23 - 137:26)
that Splatoon has an effect on people (137:24 - 137:28)
here in Japan with the idea of color T (137:26 - 137:31)
fours I think people weren't always very (137:28 - 137:33)
competitive here in Japan as far as I (137:31 - 137:35)
could see but Splatoon has really made (137:33 - 137:38)
competitive fun and um and not (137:35 - 137:40)
aggressive so it's like you know blue (137:38 - 137:42)
versus red and stuff like that so I (137:40 - 137:44)
think it's it's breeding a good (137:42 - 137:46)
mentality in the game industry here for (137:44 - 137:48)
having fun type of turf wars in a cute (137:46 - 137:52)
way yeah yeah good point well I am out (137:48 - 137:55)
of questions I've I've kept you I've (137:52 - 137:56)
kept you for an hour here so I don't (137:55 - 137:59)

just have you back in the future yeah (138:11 - 138:15)
that' be great get me back a monster (138:13 - 138:18)

AE v n KO which is my actual name I've (138:39 - 138:44)

quick break but Adam I want you to (139:02 - 139:06)
request our Pokemon of the week so when (139:05 - 139:08)
we come back we can uh go in depth with (139:06 - 139:10)

people and and give some people some fun (139:10 - 139:14)
facts they might not know about the (139:13 - 139:16)
Pokemon you can't be Victini can't it's (139:14 - 139:18)
it's my favorite so it comes to mind (139:16 - 139:19)
yeah no it can be Victini I don't think (139:18 - 139:22)
we've ever done Victini so yeah I think (139:19 - 139:23)
that works like it's such a it's such a (139:22 - 139:26)
weak beginning Pokemon yeah Victini (139:23 - 139:28)
would probably be the one okay awesome (139:26 - 139:29)
well we will take a quick break thank (139:28 - 139:32)
you so much Adam for hanging out find (139:29 - 139:34)

cast.com and uh hopefully we can do an (141:03 - 141:08)
email show in a week or two here where (141:05 - 141:11)
we do some emails but I'm going to throw (141:08 - 141:14)
it to Travis for Pokemon of the (141:11 - 141:18)
week our Pokemon of the week this week (141:14 - 141:19)
is (141:18 - 141:21)
Victini (141:19 - 141:24)
Victini is an interesting Pokemon (141:21 - 141:28)
because it gets access to the signature (141:24 - 141:32)
moves of Kum zerum and rerum in addition (141:28 - 141:35)
to its own signature move VC create so (141:32 - 141:37)
it has a lot of options in addition to (141:35 - 141:41)
just some good moves aside from those so (141:37 - 141:43)
there are a number of ways you can go (141:41 - 141:47)
with it one of the options is to do (141:43 - 141:49)
something something with Choice band to (141:47 - 141:54)
do a physical set usually you would do a (141:49 - 141:57)
jolly nature Choice band increases the (141:54 - 141:59)
damage of your physical attacking moves (141:57 - 142:02)
but locks you into one you would put (141:59 - 142:05)
your Eves into attack and speed and then (142:02 - 142:09)
do VC create bolt strike U-turn and then (142:05 - 142:12)
trick to swap your choice band under the (142:09 - 142:14)
opponent and get their item and give (142:12 - 142:16)
Choice Banda something that wouldn't get (142:14 - 142:18)
a benefit out of it and would only get (142:16 - 142:20)
the detriment out of it that's not the (142:18 - 142:22)
set that I'm going (142:20 - 142:25)
to modify and make our own but I thought (142:22 - 142:26)
I would throw that one out there cuz (142:25 - 142:28)
that's an option too instead we're going (142:26 - 142:30)
to make a slight modification on one of (142:28 - 142:33)
the common move sets which is a mixed (142:30 - 142:37)
sweeper Victini that's often set up (142:33 - 142:40)
because of the power of V create and (142:37 - 142:44)
bolt strike as well as being a way (142:40 - 142:48)
to take out a lot of defensive Pokemon a (142:44 - 142:49)
lot of walls you would call this like a (142:48 - 142:53)
wall breaker and it's also got some (142:49 - 142:56)
special moves uh typically glaciate and (142:53 - 142:59)
then glaciate or glaciate depending on (142:56 - 143:03)
your pronunciation and energy ball for (142:59 - 143:05)
the two special attacks I'm going to (143:03 - 143:06)
switch that up a little bit we'll see (143:05 - 143:08)
when we get there but we'll start from (143:06 - 143:11)
the top we're going to put most of our (143:08 - 143:14)
EES in special attack because the (143:11 - 143:16)
physical attacking moves we have are (143:14 - 143:18)
already so incredibly power powerful (143:16 - 143:23)
given their base power that we can uh (143:18 - 143:25)
that we can afford to (143:23 - 143:28)
put 160 special attack into special (143:25 - 143:32)
attack and 96 into physical attack with (143:28 - 143:34)
the remaining 252 going to speed we're (143:32 - 143:37)
going to do Hasty nature and give (143:34 - 143:42)
Victini a life orb instead of going so (143:37 - 143:43)
so V create is pretty much an auto (143:42 - 143:46)
include given that it's a same type (143:43 - 143:48)
attack bonus move that Victini has (143:46 - 143:51)
access to that has the ridiculous base (143:48 - 143:53)
power of (143:51 - 143:56)
180 accuracy of 95 although that's (143:53 - 143:59)
bumped up given victini's ability (143:56 - 144:02)
Victory star which increases the (143:59 - 144:04)
accuracy of Victini and also any of its (144:02 - 144:06)
allies if it's a double or triple battle (144:04 - 144:09)
although this set is made for singles so (144:06 - 144:12)
that it increases it by 10% so that 95 (144:09 - 144:16)
essentially becomes a 100 op the V (144:12 - 144:19)
creates downside is that it lowers (144:16 - 144:21)
victini's defense special defense and (144:19 - 144:25)
speed by a stage so typically you use (144:21 - 144:28)
that to either finish off or one hit KO (144:25 - 144:33)
a Pokemon and then maybe get an another (144:28 - 144:36)
attack in because you likely outsped the (144:33 - 144:37)
first turn so if you finish the thing (144:36 - 144:39)
off then you could probably get another (144:37 - 144:42)
attack in either with (144:39 - 144:46)
another V create or bolt strike you know (144:42 - 144:50)
or the other move moves um then you take (144:46 - 144:53)
a hit because likely you'll be outsped (144:50 - 144:55)
this time because your speed is lowered (144:53 - 144:58)
but if you can survive a hit then you (144:55 - 144:59)
then you would switch out after that or (144:58 - 145:01)
switch out after your first VC create if (144:59 - 145:04)
you're getting to a position that isn't (145:01 - 145:06)
advantageous to you second move is Bolt (145:04 - 145:09)
strike which is typically the signature (145:06 - 145:12)
move of zerum Bolt strike is 85% (145:09 - 145:14)
accuracy which gets bumped up from (145:12 - 145:16)
Victory star 130 base power which is (145:14 - 145:19)
also very high and has a 20% chance to (145:16 - 145:20)
paralyze the (145:19 - 145:23)
target which is also nice we're not (145:20 - 145:26)
going to use blue flare which is rushim (145:23 - 145:30)
signature ability even though having a (145:26 - 145:32)
very strong special attacking move would (145:30 - 145:35)
be nice it becomes redundant coverage (145:32 - 145:37)
with V create and we're obviously going (145:35 - 145:40)
to choose V create over it because of (145:37 - 145:42)
just how high that base power is even (145:40 - 145:44)
though it even though blue flare doesn't (145:42 - 145:47)
have a downside the 180 base power of V (145:44 - 145:50)
create is hard to say no to they (145:47 - 145:53)
recommend glaciate here which is [ __ ] (145:50 - 145:55)
and I see here I'm getting this set from (145:53 - 145:58)
smun glaciate is kum's signature ability (145:55 - 146:03)
it's 65 base power 95% accuracy and is (145:58 - 146:04)
guaranteed to lower the target speed by (146:03 - 146:09)
a stage it's a useful utility ice is a (146:04 - 146:12)
good Mo a good type to have coverage for (146:09 - 146:16)
but I know how frustrating it can be (146:12 - 146:18)
when (146:16 - 146:21)
you don't have a when you have a dual (146:18 - 146:23)
type Pokemon and you only have stab for (146:21 - 146:24)
one of those two (146:23 - 146:27)
types especially if it's a type like (146:24 - 146:30)
psychic psychic is such a great type to (146:27 - 146:32)
have with its super Effectiveness (146:30 - 146:34)
against fighting types and and poison (146:32 - 146:39)
types so while there are instances (146:34 - 146:42)
where maybe you would say eh I probably (146:39 - 146:43)
don't (146:42 - 146:47)
need both types to be covered in my move (146:43 - 146:47)
set (146:47 - 146:49)
uh maybe in an instance like if a (146:47 - 146:52)
Pokemon has has poison as its secondary (146:49 - 146:54)
type although that's sort of changed now (146:52 - 146:56)
that it's super effective against fairy (146:54 - 147:00)
and Gen 6 psychic is one that there's so (146:56 - 147:03)
many fighting type Pokemon out there (147:00 - 147:08)
that it's hard for me to give up on that (147:03 - 147:10)
fighting is a very common type given how (147:08 - 147:12)
many steel and and rock types can be in (147:10 - 147:13)
the meta (147:12 - 147:16)
so having psychic to defend against that (147:13 - 147:18)
is (147:16 - 147:20)
a good idea so I would recommend Psych (147:18 - 147:23)
the move psychic over glaciate but I do (147:20 - 147:25)
recognize that glaciate gives a lot of (147:23 - 147:29)
utility against dragons and um can sort (147:25 - 147:31)
of stop sweepers in their tracks by (147:29 - 147:33)
lowering their speed but I thought I (147:31 - 147:36)
would give you my two cents to sort of (147:33 - 147:38)
customize the set a little bit and then (147:36 - 147:39)
I would (147:38 - 147:42)
recommend as they do either energy ball (147:39 - 147:46)
or Grass Knot depending on if you expect (147:42 - 147:48)
to go against lot of heavy Pokemon I (147:46 - 147:50)
would typically just do energy ball (147:48 - 147:52)
because that way that I don't like all (147:50 - 147:55)
those variables cuz grass is a good type (147:52 - 147:57)
to have it's good against ground it's (147:55 - 148:01)
good against Rock um water is a type (147:57 - 148:03)
that you can have a lot of trouble with (148:01 - 148:06)
because it's only weak to electric and (148:03 - 148:08)
grass so having access to that grass (148:06 - 148:12)
move can be helpful I think I think (148:08 - 148:13)
that's it I think I covered everything (148:12 - 148:18)
right yeah that sounds great cool there (148:13 - 148:20)
you go there's some Victini for you if (148:18 - 148:23)
you get a shiny one it's going to be (148:20 - 148:27)
white instead of orange yellow pale (148:23 - 148:29)
orange i''s say it's orange uh so it's (148:27 - 148:32)
going to be white instead pretty cool (148:29 - 148:34)
Victini was first shown in the preview (148:32 - 148:37)
of the 14th Pokémon movie at the end of (148:34 - 148:40)
zorok Masters of Illusion victini's you (148:37 - 148:43)
NOA Pokédex number is 00 making it the (148:40 - 148:45)
first Pokémon to legitimately have the (148:43 - 148:49)
number 00 in in any Pokedex listing (148:45 - 148:51)
Victini is the only Pokemon to be listed (148:49 - 148:54)
before the starter Pokemon of its native (148:51 - 148:56)
region Victini is the only mythical (148:54 - 148:59)
Pokemon or of a later generation to (148:56 - 149:01)
appear next to a mythical Pokemon of an (148:59 - 149:04)
earlier generation man these facts (149:01 - 149:06)
they're just off the (149:04 - 149:11)
chart Victini has a shiny Sprite Pokemon (149:06 - 149:12)
Black and White are programmed so that (149:11 - 149:15)
the shiny Victini cannot be encountered (149:12 - 149:19)
it shares his traits with RAM and zeram (149:15 - 149:21)
according to IGN's interview Victini is (149:19 - 149:25)
muda's favorite generation 5 pokemon (149:21 - 149:28)
vitini was designed by Mana ible and it (149:25 - 149:31)
was most it was meant to appeal more to (149:28 - 149:34)
girls than boys I want to click on this (149:31 - 149:36)
name real quick we shouldn't do this in (149:34 - 149:38)
an audio podcast we go down this train (149:36 - 149:46)
of of of not knowing uh Mana ible is a (149:38 - 149:47)
graphic designer who worked for the (149:46 - 149:49)
Pokemon Trading Card Game and video game (149:47 - 149:52)
series I's first known (149:49 - 149:55)
involvement uh of the Pokemon franchise (149:52 - 149:58)
was in the staff of Pokemon Platinum (149:55 - 150:01)
under special thanks she later (149:58 - 150:04)
Illustrated a card in the AR arus (150:01 - 150:06)
expansion (150:04 - 150:08)
metric in Pokemon Black and White she's (150:06 - 150:12)
listed under Pokemon designer and uh (150:08 - 150:15)
here are the Pokémon she created Victini (150:12 - 150:20)
perier dark aruka D darmanitan eloga (150:15 - 150:25)
frillish galent axu fracture haxus (150:20 - 150:29)
stunfisk and clef key that is those are (150:25 - 150:32)
some those are some great designs that's (150:29 - 150:34)
a she's great I love all those (150:32 - 150:37)
Pokemon yeah those that's that's cool (150:34 - 150:40)
it's it's uh it's weird that she didn't (150:37 - 150:42)
design lilypop (150:40 - 150:46)
or uh stoutland but she did Herdier I (150:42 - 150:50)
think strange that's interesting she uh (150:46 - 150:52)
maybe her ear was designed first and (150:50 - 150:54)
then some other people designed around (150:52 - 150:58)
her deer maybe yeah she was uh Pokemon (150:54 - 150:59)
character design in Black and White 2 (150:58 - 151:01)
black and white and Pokemon character (150:59 - 151:05)
design in X and Y and Pokemon character (151:01 - 151:08)
design and a 3D art director in Omega (151:05 - 151:12)
Ruby Alpha Sapphire so I'm not (151:08 - 151:14)
sure if she designed anything for sun (151:12 - 151:16)
and moon but we'll I guess we'll find (151:14 - 151:17)
out (151:16 - 151:21)
and finally in Black and White 2 if (151:17 - 151:23)
Victini is taken to Liberty Garden it (151:21 - 151:25)
comes out of its Pokeball and dances (151:23 - 151:27)
around (151:25 - 151:30)
happily conceptually it might be drawn (151:27 - 151:34)
from inspiration from Nike Nike the (151:30 - 151:37)
Greek winged goddess of Victory or (151:34 - 151:41)
Victoria the Roman equivalent of Nike is (151:37 - 151:44)
it Nike Nike I I'm not familiar with (151:41 - 151:48)
this deity there you go its theme of V (151:44 - 151:50)
could be linked to somehow somewhat the (151:48 - 151:52)
fifth generation's mascot V being the (151:50 - 151:55)
Roman numeral for five V also derived (151:52 - 151:58)
from the initial uh (151:55 - 152:01)
Victory Victini has a lot going for it (151:58 - 152:04)
it made our list it's a great Pokemon (152:01 - 152:09)
yeah it made the list that uh that wraps (152:04 - 152:12)

doing I definitely enjoy Guan Hunter and (152:39 - 152:43)
the the videos that are put out it's (152:41 - 152:45)
usually the first thing that is linked (152:43 - 152:46)
to in the Monster Hunter Channel and (152:45 - 152:49)
slack so if you guys dig it totally if (152:46 - 152:51)
you uh thinking about getting into a (152:49 - 152:52)
monster hunter if that's another game (152:51 - 152:55)
you want to play there are more than (152:52 - 152:57)
enough people that will be willing to (152:55 - 153:01)
help you out in slack uh myself included (152:57 - 153:05)
but uh Travis is that the Travis W can I (153:01 - 153:07)
jump in and plug something else yeah (153:05 - 153:09)
yeah plug away plug away you ever just (153:07 - 153:11)
make a podcast on a (153:09 - 153:15)
l all the time you ever just think I (153:11 - 153:17)
should make a new podcast today (153:15 - 153:19)
well that was me a few days ago my (153:17 - 153:21)
brother and I used to run a podcast (153:19 - 153:23)
called the real house which was (153:21 - 153:26)
unfortunately named because it included (153:23 - 153:28)
not only a pun that was hard to (153:26 - 153:29)
understand because it was supposed to be (153:28 - 153:31)
wheelhouse like the concept of oh that's (153:29 - 153:34)
in our wheelhouse but real house cuz we (153:31 - 153:35)
talked about movies but that was (153:34 - 153:37)
unfortunate cuz we also talked about (153:35 - 153:39)
music so it didn't really play it was a (153:37 - 153:41)
bad marketing decision to name with that (153:39 - 153:44)
we've made a new podcast and are (153:41 - 153:47)
probably making all of the same mark (153:44 - 153:49)
marketing poor marketing decisions the (153:47 - 153:52)
show is called arbitrary archive my (153:49 - 153:57)
brother and I have recently both gotten (153:52 - 154:00)
jobs Moonlighting at an undisclosed Data (153:57 - 154:02)
Center and on our third day on the job (154:00 - 154:06)
we discovered a self-aware AI buried in (154:02 - 154:09)
a back room the AI introduced itself as (154:06 - 154:12)
Jeff that's J period E Period F period F (154:09 - 154:14)
period as it's an acronym we don't know (154:12 - 154:18)
for what yet and and Jeff instructed us (154:14 - 154:21)
that in some undisclosed time in the (154:18 - 154:23)
future there will be what he calls the (154:21 - 154:25)
flood which will destroy all of human (154:23 - 154:29)
culture and each week Jeff gives us a (154:25 - 154:32)
word um our first episode the word was (154:29 - 154:34)
hot dog so DJ and I had to each pick a (154:32 - 154:37)
piece of media independently that had to (154:34 - 154:39)
do with the word hot dog and review it (154:37 - 154:41)
at the end of the week we got our second (154:39 - 154:44)
word which is beginning so we both have (154:41 - 154:46)
to pick some media whether it be movie (154:44 - 154:50)
TV show video game album that has to do (154:46 - 154:52)
with beginning for our second episode (154:50 - 154:54)
and we'll review it and that's how the (154:52 - 154:56)
show is going to go we have to catalog (154:54 - 154:58)
all of human culture one word at a time (154:56 - 155:02)
and that's at arbitrary archive.com or (154:58 - 155:05)
soundcloud.com arbitrary archive I don't (155:02 - 155:07)
it's it's not in iTunes yet as we're (155:05 - 155:10)
recording this perhaps the RSS feed will (155:07 - 155:13)
be approved by iTunes uh by the time you (155:10 - 155:15)
listen and then at that point I assume (155:13 - 155:17)
you could just search arbit Char archive (155:15 - 155:19)
and find us there too I have not (155:17 - 155:21)
listened to you yet but I cannot wait (155:19 - 155:22)
