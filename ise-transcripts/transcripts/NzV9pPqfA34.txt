[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 404 sewed it's like we're starting over of the Pokemon podcast we are starting on yet another 100 episodes ago for the next milestone I guess I'm your host reboot spj with me is will I'm drinking a delicious pomegranate blueberry sparkling ice I don't know what a pomegranate tastes like so I just didn't the last time I had a pomegranate was like in 1994 when I was in Brazil if you think my taste buds have taste buds have that good memory you're thinking the wrong thing how did you avoid the pomegranate Bonanza that was the early 2000s granted I don't like the shape of those bottles like the palm know I know that bottle is in offense no I usually wearing the hemp necklaces and the what no I wore the little seashells little circle seashells put the show I had a Peter Sellers yeah I think that's whatever you and cool like me so you just gel Greg also here I am also here I feel like I should talk in also big I'm offering you a deluxe voice package I've already invoiced you one hundred and ninety eight thousand dollars you can pay it off whenever you want but you do now owe me one hundred ninety eight thousand dollars Tom Nook is probably the smartest businessman here hey you didn't have to get the house you can live in that musty old tent for as long as you live in the tent but you can't hang things on the tent walls and when you have that right and you got a diner clock you need to hang i got gears what's the name of your town car a tropic rama so bad why even greg what's the name of your town Avalon half a lawn that's so very Arthurian yes it is you don't like the combination of Tropicana and Krammer amp merged together and what a delightful worry that's not a thing what do you mean well what is here town moo-cow neoui oh nice so the town I grew up in in Hawaii though you can't name it after a real town strangely enough I did why can't you I mean I used to name them after my pets but then my pets went you know the way of the dodo and I felt bad about going back to those towns I guess that makes sense I am regretting that I couldn't go with my jocks suggestion of buff burg and I thought of buffer I love swole bill that I have although goose' just piled the biceps yeah all right well I don't think people want to hear too much about animal crossing but everyone is playing animal crossing there's two things that I feel like the Internet has been really good at talking about it is the corona virus and it is an elk crossing so while we do have some Pokemon news related to the corona virus let's put that on the DL for now we do it's off the official pokemon website so okay tackle that top three things in people's lives right now Animal Crossing then coronavirus and then we're gonna hit off the number three thing in people's lives the thing you can do I did plenty Pokemon go this morning I took a walk over to st. Paul I'm back but you can go to st. Paul it's automatically social distance of 15 miles nobody lives there so see this place to be oh man off Pokemon calm complete genesect special research in Pokemon go you can access the special research story event to get the mythical Pokemon genesect which is its Pokemon go debuted in the ticketed special research story event we will encounter the Paleozoic Pokemon itself in addition all trainers will be able to participate in a separate genesect themed event throughout the same weekend whether they have a ticket to the story or not for our I go through this tickets are still available until Thursday March 26 even when this event ends on March 26 you will still be able to start the genesect event as long as you hit the accept event button before you you do it like any event in task in Pokemon go they don't remove it from you it might just be harder to do after the fact with that being said did you guys spend at the $7.99 or equivalent in your local currency to do this story event heck no well since I use saint-paul duckets it's don't live in Saint Paul you're in the border town yeah yeah basically um I'm haven't done it yet but I'm looking at literally looking at the Buy button right now and I'm probably gonna do it I I keep forgetting to play pokemon go so I'm not spending the dollars to forget to do it okay I mean that's fair yeah I might I might drive around this evening and drive to the local park and not get on my card just to check this fun because I I do want to I do want to at least try to make some progress in it I'm still on I'm still I'm not still on step one but if you haven't bought it yet I'll tell you what it's about so the story event is called a drive to investigate I'll take that started on Friday March 20th it will go until Thursday March 26 again as long as you purchase it and start it between that time frame you will be able to continue it after the dates are over it is 799 it will get you a special research line with early access to genesect and it's Jenna sects first time in Pokemon go we're assuming although they don't say that Jenna sites will oh it does say at the end Jenna sites will go to e^x raids come April although because of the current happenstance no e.x raids are being sent out currently so we'll see if Niantic re-evaluates that next month the event will also get you a metal metal if you like to collect metals in Pokemon go get to one of those same as the regigigas one it will give you research objectives that lead you to encounter more bug and steel type Pokemon including pincer Scizor Skarmory kara blasts and shell man as well as other Pokemon that appear in the story that are related to genesect this research will also lead you to encounter a durant a Pokemon only available in the eastern hemisphere if $7.99 is cheaper than I'm playing tape well I don't know plane tickets might be real cheap right now ok real cheap you will get an exclusive genesect themed avatar item you will get a genesect backpack and a genesect hat and then your $7.99 will also get you 5 premium battle passes three super incubators three charged teams three fast teams three incensed three star pieces one puffin 15 rare candy and one glacier ler which does you know equal over eight dollars of items that being said you don't get off all of those right off the bat you get them as you go through the quest line and then you also get encounters with Scyther Skarmory nincada and shield on when you complete some of the research tasks if you miss out you can get genesect and ax raids in the future I don't know if that convinces anyone well I mean I just bought my ticket and I'm giving my side and given my Snivy some manners in addition to the genesect research there are other events happening if you do not get the ticket to drive to investigate there will be 1 to 4 star raids throughout the weekend that will feature various bug in steel type Pokemon normal fire water electric and ice type Pokemon will appear more in the while including Pokemon like jiggly puff Magnemite Merrill Hound hour and snorunt ninja nincada will appear in the wild am hatch and 5k eggs and if you're lucky trainers you may encounter or hatch a shiny nincada or nincada still not sure how to pronounce that karabast I'm looking at my do there it is my dias my name a charge how long I mean it's cicada so I'm assuming yeah I would know with nincada all right well I got charts the DS remind me in like 10 minutes all right you can earn twice you can earn the toys toyz the amount of Stardust in the next in this time period for hatching Pokemon Kara blastin Chelm it will appear in 5k eggs and that's it that's everything so that goes until Thursday March 26 10 p.m. local time so even when you're listening to this podcast on Monday or Tuesday you still do have some time to decide if you want to social distance your way around these raids and Pokemon that are appearing there's a Pidgey in my house I need that for the normal type of catch 25 normal types that's the hardest one in this game for genesect you need 25 to genesect is that wacky professor thinks whatever evidence he found looked like a normal type attack did we talked about this last week where if if you have one pokey coin you can get 30 in cents from these stores on one-time purchase and in sense not they now last an hour and sub 30 minutes for now and they they are literally spawning like one Pokemon a minute so that is Annie antics way of letting people play at home because you're going to get probably 30 30 or so poking spawning in your house without you leaving or moving the only problem with that is because you're not moving you're probably not getting pokeballs so either give yourself a late late night drive through a downtown area to spend a bunch of stops or now is the time to add friends and open their gifts because you're gonna run out of gifts to go somebody will send you gifts yeah I still get plenty of gifts yeah you just gotta open the 20 gifts but like I had to send gifts out yeah I have to go out and get gifts and it's it's a wasteland out there not in Wisconsin or something that I don't think we get the memo here I got the memo I don't think other people did some sort and shield news actually speaking of events maybe you want to stay in your house you want to do some sword and shield maybe you're not on the animal crossing bandwagon I got some news for you March 19th pokemon.com glaring rapidash Clarion Daraa Mook Amanda buzzer fetch and more version exclusive Pokemon might appear in max ray battles take this opportunity to catch pokemon that don't normally appear and you're in the wild in your game version as well as Pokemon that may be hard to find I'm super excited for this especially because I usually do raid some Monday nights and I think Monday night is still during the event time right yeah this will go til Wednesday March 25th so yeah so Greg we're gonna get on it I've been doing it well I didn't crossing my animals okay I crossed animals too but not until Friday I did it Wednesday Thursday and Friday evening I was in there I was getting my fossils I was getting my sir fetched I was getting my tins of beans that are from another game I was getting all that so I've been making like easy graphics for these on my Twitter and Instagram and I have learned since making these helpful graphics that people don't understand how raids work so when I posted this last one which is the rapid - Daraa Makkah when I posted this last one what was the response I got I get a lot of these response so I'll just read a generic on here I've been playing sword and shield I've been playing shield I have gotten literally everything on the screen they don't appear exclusively in one version at least from not what I seen is the comment I got when I made this huh sir fetch will not ever appear in shield but that doesn't mean you can't log into the why comm and see a sir fetch from somebody who is hosting from sword this event is now giving you the opportunity for sir fetch to appear in shield without you resulting on going to the Y comm that is clearly the the misunderstanding that they these people don't have also when I made the Gengar what was it the King gar Machamp Snorlax grass or Alexia so specifically and this is still going on Gengar appears in three and four star raids in both games but only five star raids and in shield and only Machamp appears in five star rates and sword but it will appear in 3 & 4 star raids in both games pretty easy to like think about that right and the amount of comments of life nah-ah I got Gangaram my game and I was like did you not miss the giant part where it said Gangaram a champ up here in both games only in 3 to 4 star raids which probably doesn't matter unless you just you're really looking for a 5 star Gengar for whatever reason and what's weird is I have a sword and have not seen a single Machamp yeah I think they yeah they're not they're not I think in the five stars they're 20% in the four and three stars I think they're only like 10% so ideally you should be seeing more Machamp weather if there are five stars but you have to clear out your raids and refresh and stuff and not with this new thing overlapping it's a little weird so speaking of this new thing it's still on this new thing all players will encounter s Cavalier SL gore and pink urchin which Pinkerton in itself is rare via saw gore and the escapa lear required trading so this is gonna help people out who don't have any friends to trade those two pokemon and sword you will encounter gallery' and rapidash glare and corsola manda buzz or ranga Oran guru Ren guru and then female in didi while in shield you'll be able to encounter Dara Mooka dar maka raver Airy past Simeon sir fetch and Mail indeedy instead which is even if you have these Pokemon it's an opportunity to get because these Pokemon are boosted and promoted whether you have sword or shield or you have friends that have the other version you'll be able to get at least their hidden abilities a little bit easier since they're only available in raids and you need to connect your Nintendo switch to the Internet make sure you update your wild area and then at the end of this it says that Giganta max Machamp hangar and Snorlax will also go until March 25th so on Wednesday evening all of these Pokemon should leave and then we should get a new raid rotation we haven't gotten Garr boater or two raladin dural udon promoted yet there was another Pokemon we didn't get promoted Charizard hasn't been promoted yet I'm missing one okappa Rajah that's the other one yes the one I don't have yeah I'm missing copper Rajah to you you don't have a copper asha at all or you don't have a gigantic there's some raid stuff and sword and shield I'm excited for this especially since you know gym time is severely cut back some Pokemon you gotta get that ring fit so you can exercise in your house please let's not talk of is not for sale any laws never sale anymore yeah I heard switches are also really hard to find right now too well if you're staying at home I got good news for you episode 3 of Twilight wings is out you can catch the third episode of Twilight wings the 7 episode limited animated series I'm Pokemon TV and the official Pokemon Channel first two episodes are available there the previous episode we saw gym leader B get caught up in Herring a herring a harrowing ordeal while training out with her pokemon this time the action follows hop the younger brother of the gallery in' and his adorable Wu Liu turn tune in to see what adventure waits these two partners ok you said it was a waste of time watching B go around neck nothing appeared of watching that woohoo just do nothing oh man I really like them be cute well look I like this episode if you want it boring if you want to hear mine and Irene's thoughts about the 3rd episode that will be for anyone who is $5 or more on patreon that should be coming either Monday or Tuesday I just I'm so behind on on a lot of things this week so I don't want to promise Monday Monday or Tuesday it should be up for you guys on patreon for that and we're still trying to figure out when we can get the Mewtwo one up Irene was extremely busy last week and now she has all the time in the world so we will figure out how to we'll figure out when we can get the me to stuff up for you guys I'm going forward here ok so I I'm gonna do Pokemon masters but that might be a little bit longer so there was a lot of stories this past week of people getting in trouble for being out in a out and playing pokemon go especially in Italy but those stories are that I just told you the gist of it prettiest I made but they're not supposed to be out they are out shame right wow this is coronavirus related I think there's a more interesting story I think everyone is probably maybe purchased a t-shirt from T Fury before or at least maybe heard of T Fury I've heard it I think so do they make my unicorn t-shirts baby there's a lot of tissue there's like yet the Yeti and then there's T fury and then there's a Threadless they're always pumping out t-shirts this is off bleeding cool calm this time people were very upset here with them due to a design that went for sales yesterday one signed and one design known by an artist named capo depicted a Pokemon pokeballs only cook Ovid 19 virus with the caption gotta catch them all yep not good this other also depicted of a virus holding a free sign saying free hugs also not good and people then on Twitter yelled at T fury for these and T fury post a message saying we at T fury recognize that the current situation regarding Co vid 19 is extremely serious and is impacting all members of our community and missed the crisis we've looked to light-hearted humor to keep our spirits lifted we are grateful to the ki fury artist community for what they have done and continue to do to make a smile in this light these two designs that were posted were not well received by our community aka they didn't make any money from them please rest assured that our attention was not to be insensitive or disrespectful in any way both designs have been removed from the site and we sincerely apologize for the mistake it is such a weasel wording cunning these two design the poster were not well-received by our community they're in incredibly poor taste having good shirts and yeah it's like if they had made money or you had a bunch of people defending you you would have just been like no poor keeping up because it's humor it's like it's like it's like when the it's like go in a twelve-year-old comes into like a twitch stream and they say something really dumb and you like get out what and they're like well it's just a joke and you're like no here we have consequences for your actions ban yeah also please be assured that our intention was not to be insensitive or disrespectful actually it was that's the goal of the shirts they are poking fun at a very sensitive situation in an insensitive and disrespectful manner which is supposed to be where the humor comes from but it didn't your intention and the intentions of these shirts was to be an insensitive garbage this should be the last bit of coronavirus stuff I I believe for the episode here so this is a Pokemon calm important update regarding play pokemon events after discussion with event organizers and guidance set 5 the set forth by local regional and national health authorities as well as the world health the World Health Organization all play pokemon sanctioned events through May 14th 2020 in North America Latin America South America Oceania South Africa and Europe have been cancelled this includes all Pokemon regional championships special events leak challenges League Cups premier challenges midseason showdowns and pre-release tournaments no championship points will be awarded during this time while independent of Pokemon organisers of these events should act in the best interest of their events and community including always being mindful of safety of participants we appreciate their cooperation their partnership during this challenge time well we do continue to closely monitor health mandates guidelines and recommendations from appropriate government agencies while availing evaluating all independent and Pokemon organised events on a case-by-case basis everything up to May 14th canceled we don't know if things are gonna be better elsewhere May 14th or after May 14th I know like believe South Korea is the main country that has things semi under control but they also got it back in December worlds is in the UK still for those that haven't been following to play pokemon events too closely so this is the first time that worlds would be out of North America it's been in like Hawaii Florida California it's also been in Canada once so August is a long way away and I believe the Madison sorry they're not in Madison anymore the Milwaukee regionals was scheduled for June 1st so that's still technically scheduled June is pretty far away still but I guess we don't know and I guess once we get closer to May 14th we'll have an update I believe they also tweeted although I don't have the tweet in front of me that they will be reevaluating how many championship points you will need to go to Worlds because I don't think to have it I think unless you're like winning like multiple regionals yeah you still might not even have enough I think you only get like 120 for retraining or regionals and you need 400 to get to Worlds but I don't have that in front of me at this point a lot of events cancelled yep it's a whole new world we live in well for the time being as well the time being not for all eternity now that'd [Laughter] true let's take a quick break we got some Pokemon masters news we have some more sword shield news we still have our questions of the week or Pokemon of the week all that stuff so we will be right back Newsweek look brain assaulted not a lot of people reported on this directly I think I tweeted it but sometimes I don't want to use my own tweet those sources here cite them yeah well you know okay this is OP Newsweek Pokemon sword and shield got a new update that fixes a bug that would crash when a vers trainer received a hacked Pokemon you know if you guys heard about this I did not hear about that yeah well it fixed it so you should be good now while there was a handful of bugs and problems with sword and shields the latest update 1.1.1 fixes a game crashing bug that caused many people to avoid using a popular feature in gen8 games of course they don't list the feature because they're probably not that educated but rude so okay so this is what I was waiting for this is why I couldn't find this the night the update went out this is why I pulled this article because it has the source the citing the source here so you guys don't know anytime something gets updated in Pokemon it's like sore shield or Pokemon home the Japanese support Pokemon website will say what it fixes we've talked about this before but the English website will never say what it fixes because of legal reasons Thank You lawyers so so this so Newsweek is reporting on Pokemon coach JP slash support or whatever it is translated so probably a little bit wrong when receiving a Pokemon that contains falsified data by surprise trade or communication trade we responded to the phenomenon such as game stoppage obviously that's a pretty poor translation ideally if you guys didn't hear about this there was an issue where people were making Pokemon using third-party apps probably something like pkx or whatnot and they were Pokemon that would not that these sort and shield games couldn't read properly when that Pokemon was like selected or highlighted in a player's game it would cause the game to completely crash you wouldn't lose anything but your game would hard reboot so the way to fix it was to either one just never surprise trade because you if you didn't listen to this podcast or follow any of this news you would have no idea that this is happening or to if you did receive it you would have to highlight the Pokemon and delete it not inspect it because inspecting it would cause the game to crash oh no so you have to immediately release it this update the one point one point one fixed that issue so now you're safe to surprise trade again everything's good official changelog also states several issues have been fixed to make the gameplay experience more comfortable but nothing was stated on that what does that mean hmm more comfortable is such a weird they changed the volume levels on the sound effects for steeps ears maybe I you it you know I wish they would the sounds they send him soft skittles so yeah you can you can surprise for it again again if you were surprised writing that's not really my bag I mean I was for a while there but then I stopped because I've been wandering on home oh the old Pokemon home mm-hmm need to look at my achievements on there that whole not to get back into animal crossing but the whole Nuuk miles thing has me like all hooked on a cheese everywhere and pokemons got him they're still mostly busted for me so the people who date of mine the Pokemon games and like post you know shiny ads and stuff they only said that he think that they saw in the code that it fixed the surprise trade they didn't say anything else so I'm not sure what the you know the other update did I don't know what else it did I guess we don't know unless you know the three people in the entire world who data mined Pokemon games decide that they want to look at the code again I feel like they would have probably done it by now since it's been almost a week but they haven't really said it or tweeted anything about it it still stands that you know some people believe that these shiny odds are broken in the overworld the Pokemon company has pushed two updates now and I don't whether it's broken or not I guess we still don't know I mean we're taking the word that some people believe that the data miners say it's broken but the data miners also were the same people that told us we needed to have some sort of chain which then Pokemon comm said we didn't need a chain so believe who you want to believe I guess but that has not been touched I guess that code remains unmodified so and then people still setting their dates forward to manipulate raids like that that still exists too so the update didn't fix either of that although I don't know if those are more complicated issues or the Pokemon company doesn't care about it or Hoonah I don't know that's that's that's hard to say but the thing that would cause your game to crash fixed good to go being a Pokemon home because Greg brought that up this is off the gamer comm Pokemon home catches man I hate this headline Pokemon home catches two point six million in gross revenue during its first month oh c'mon home has been available for a month there is a clear picture of how many people find value in the ability of transferring their stored Pokemon from a broad range of titles in the series since the 8th since the launch the app has brought in 2.6 million worldwide 38 percent of that revenue coming from the United States and about 33 percent coming from Japan downloads were distributed among among a similar matter u.s. claiming about 700 thousand downloads Japan claiming about 500,000 downloads and Great Britain Germany France all have downloads to about one hundred and twenty thousand each that's kind of that's kind of just the news that goes into like thick download numbers but ok a lot of people have downloaded Pokemon home and this right doesn't work yeah the chant every time I get a little badge for the challenge I don't know what challenge I completed I have no clue we're on one point 0.10 so you know we're getting there they did fix the Miggy earnest stuff so now in order to get McGee erna that was fixed server side that didn't need an update you just need a registered living Dex you don't need the Pokemon all to be existing there you don't need to shift boxes you don't need to put them in order as soon as they get as soon as pokemon home recognizes that you at one point had all 890 pokemon in it even if you don't have them anymore it will give you the Miggy Rinna that seems to be working a hundred percent now you know if you're only missing like a Zehra aura and you're standing next to somebody else who has a zero or they can just trade it to you you can try to write back and then it should register for you to get my gear now you don't have to keep it in your pokedex so if you're if you if you have seen otherwise let us know on Twitter but I have seen zero to no complaints about Miggy R not ever since like last week it seems to be seems to be okay glad that's died down now what somebody trade Greg the appropriate vivillon and stop trading him what the one he's trading away I got them all today a very wonderful person traded me all the ones I didn't have so I have my butterfly wallpaper and I'm very so beautiful I know thank you there are good people in this world there are and I have to meet one someday they have eight hidden ability Rosalia that they can do whatever they want with nice alright Pokemon masters let's get this out of the way here this is talk about notifications of things I get so many red exclamation points on the screen I feel like I've got the pox those new working masters full disclosure as always I'm partnered with DNA Greg and will or not I'm gonna read this right off Pokemon masters - game.com here limited time only team up with Sabrina and Alakazam and receive a special bonus present upon teaming up for the first time you will get a bunch of items they fix some stuff here I don't know there's a lot of things the lists yeah it's a lot you if you pull the the the gist of it is if you pull Sabrina through the scouting if you spend your gems and you happen to get Sabrina she will come with a bunch of items to help you level her up or whatever other character you want up no it's probably you do that thing where it's limited to the character oh okay so you I believe you get like the Sabrina cans and the Sabrina for uh Sabrina Soto they did that the first time they did this I think was with red like if you all read you get a bunch of yeah items okay we just had you two we just had mu y another psychic type the psychic types are the most fun but like there's a lot you could be put in the game it we've had three back-to-back psychic tapes with you know what I don't get it I have met I have my only guesses and this is just speculation maybe they had to like shift some things around and then this was already planned so they were just like let's go with it I mean maybe but it just I was like oh another psychic type and I just powered up my mute to the top I'd not gonna do another psychic type I'd like speaking of more characters Greg fan Tina yep man talk about forgettable in Gen 4 what are you insane her whole gym looked like a drift limb and amazing her gym is cool I would say that she was not she's here she's here between March 18th through April 1st till 11 p.m. on April 1st no bonus gifts when you pull her like Sabrina I had the gifts you don't get nothing with her so these are the only two I felt like this is how I feel with masters we went through like so many cool things and so like Stephen read Giovanni coming back Professor Oak Eliza and now it just feels like we have nothing like we have Sabrina and Finn Tina I mean they're more than nothing they're just not the ones you're excited for there's somebody out there their favorite gym leader is fan Tina I don't think they like Harrington yeah I guarantee it yeah I mean they just they're like their banners like okay Amy I had kind of wish that they had combined them into one banner instead of two but you know whoever you want more pull on that one more I guess I've been sort of out of masters for a little bit because these aren't that inspiring I'm like okay like I have a really good ghost type I have a really good psychic type these aren't huge drawers to make me spend my gems on them like there's gonna be another banner of something that I don't have or that there's a hole in my team that I'm just gonna wait so like these are just not that interesting I mean the if you if you Paul Fantine others the ghost of event going on so yeah something from that I guess there's not a lot of air styles what about here's the house I think fantastic fantastic hair all right it's many feet well I think that's that's all the news we have I think we did it yeah we got through all the news surprisingly we lined up episode 400 on a not popular news week and we caught up on news unless there was anything in the attic channel nope just the Brandon with the letting us know to talk about the play pokemon stuff so oh this is the tweet actually I was looking for earlier we are currently evaluating tournament cancellations that may impact the championship qualifications stipends and travel awards so they haven't got well I'm sure we'll have news about that soon of the year which is which is for what how are you gonna get away if world is existing how are you gonna get a world's invite there's just a whole lot of questions PTC Gio I don't like competitions think PTC do at this point is stable enough to host an actual tournament I gotta play that more now that I got my gaming PC I gotta get in there and played me some PTC Gio yeah you get packs I mean I did last year and then I built that blue Cephalon deck and then kind of didn't go back into it it's fun I do like PTC Gio do you yeah do you like the Pokemon Trading Card Game I do I just don't like the people who play it every trading card game oh heck no I use thanked are using magics players better than Pokemon players it depends on where you're playing magic and who you're playing with I mean I get to play magic with Greg so yes you're saying Vanguard players are better than Pokemon players Vanguard players are the most elite best card game players out there Vanguard players are non-existent would you stop that's like the fabled like kind of like the Jedi were in the original first movie and it's like just a whisper of a fabled people that's all they heard of it myth yes exactly amongst us the Vanguard players you cannot see them you will not know them but they're there hidden in the shadows ready to check their drives nincada I don't I disagree I reject agree that's even worse that's yeah neato Reno whose talks like that except for Steve black jr. he's gone forever God and never seen again Greg - the shadow realms Greg you requested the Lewinsky I forgot to put one up alright hold on oh I got a question I figured you did I always do mmm ready yeah there we go so ask us what you want what you really really want ya ask us what you want what you really want you wanna you wanna yeah what what I really really really want the question of the week not have I'm happy I'm smiling but I'm not happy Greg and I feel like I'm in a gay bar in the 90s again great it's a gift that will keep on giving Nick did a real fantastic job with the music of last week's episode of play man I'm so mad this is I'm actually pointing the email from you this is from Jake they write it and say hey guys I'm new the podcast loved the content something I really like is the dynamic you all have you seem like actual friends and it makes a difference it makes me think I'm glad we're pulling that scam off still makes me think of my own friend group one guy in particular is my Pokemon rival I showed how to ivy and Eevee train a couple years ago and now we trade ideals on move sets and team builds and when we when we have the time we also do some ferocious battles these battles are interesting because we have learned that each other's play styles and developing our own meta we also do themed battles like monotype team or Pokemon from only one region my question to you is do you guys battle each other off air or do you have other friends that you battle have you developed your own meta or do you specifically do specialty rules from time to time it could be fun to do a listener tournament or something like that love the show Jake so in slack I believe yes that there are tournaments I I used to participate in them until they named them goofy tournaments and animation with that corporate standing this yes I once also ran a tournament in our slack so if you want alternate rules what did I call it oh it was awful it yes it was awful the max tournament no it was like wills oh it was like four years ago boy and it's like you had to have one like super dumb Pokemon on your team yep no wills quickie quick law tournament you had to have I mean we've done them before and I've done them in the past I haven't done anything recently just because I've been busy yeah I'm an island called new Connie OE that has all these animal type people that rely on my services to keep them going I have tied fruitless time for Pokemon games and battles I came in second in the first slack tournament that's pretty good that's pretty good you never eat that yeah Andrew got the truth Merlyn that's like whenever I did it again so he just held on to that trophy yeah I mean I've done it in the past I do them from time to time I think they're very fun I tend to enjoy making teams but I don't I'm not good at PvP anything it just really accept that clash Royale you're pretty alright at that I was I didn't necessarily like it but I played it hahaha but there's something about the player versus player that stresses me out more than any other content so I enjoy making teams but I don't really enjoy using them I think it's because I get really too invested in winning to enjoy like the experience yeah I will say I like my peak for PvP pokémon battling tournament style stuff was Omega Ruby alpha sapphire just because like though the way that you could breed and you know get your team and do IB Evie training everything just it clicked so well for me during that time and I've kind of like lost track of how to do all the different steps to build your own team and I will say that in the past when I've done competitive of like regionals and stuff like that I've had other people make my teams for me which is enjoyable but I also you know like to build my own teams but just that the time commitment for that and just like I don't have that clique of real understanding of you know all the different steps to take to get the Pokemon that you particularly want to have for your team so that's kind of what's holding me back now I may get there with the Isle of iron iron with it well yeah that's I should have named my if we're gonna complain about Animal Crossing the problem is your town could only be like 10 characters long trust nucleo he doesn't fit either there's no space up in there they should they should have fish that gamefreak work on a Game Freak at least has gotten to 12 characters and their things did they also decide you by putting like like 20 little brown underlines yeah like oh I gonna have the best pound name ever and then you start filling it out it's like well so many dashes that you can't fill it's just cruel it's actually really bad design like like just very bad for yeah I don't - is mean spaces Dash's mean things they used to mean something to answer Jake's question uh I have been trying to actively learn and get better at competitive video game Pokemon and it is both a time-consuming and frustrating and fun experience yeah your voice really sold that one that's all of the above I didn't I do like building a team I think it's it's very obvious on paper just like the the trading card game like like I have a lot of experience with competitive stuff with the trading card game I mean I played a competitively competitively for three years and if you were listening to the podcast during that time we probably talked a lot more TCG than we do now but both the TCG in the video game like things things always look better on paper than they do in execution so you can spend like a week making a team and then it just doesn't work at all in execution and I guess because I all my Pokemon is is is streamed on Twitch I have to also be entertaining and deal with an audience and I think what's more aggravating than losing is your audience being like oh you need to make all these changes when it's the first time you need it and if I've learned anything from like the TCG it's just because you've lost one match doesn't mean you need to change five cards in your deck because consistency is so important in matches whether it's TCG or video game related also I am a very competitive person and I get tilted pretty easy this is the truest words ever out of your mouth and the first step is admitting it I I have gotten better at accepting that you know if you know you have the advantage and all of a sudden you get frozen because of the 10% chance to freeze you know and your heart you would have won but you know that 10% freeze while it is aggravating you at least know in the back of your head that you played correctly up to that point where chance seemed to take over and chance happens a lot in the video game I'll tell you the head yep it's a random number generator Fein oh I wasn't makes it fun I would have won that match if they didn't get five critical zero so I've gotten better at it um I think for me I'm very bad at understanding how they open and so that that puts you at a pretty huge disadvantage where I think I got really good at that in the trading card game of how to open perfectly and how to prepare for things but boy the whole like competitive world is such a time sink on top of the competitive aspect which pushes people away yeah but slack has tournaments all the time to answer your question yeah join slack they're doing all kinds of weird things there there there are self efficient self-sufficient yeah well goes our pokemon of the week well it's brawl discombobulated what was it like two weeks ago yeah three weeks ago who knows I was talking about the fact that you can only play sword and shield during the daytime until the game is over the Sun never sets on Galler I mean technically it does but you're in a hotel does you're forced into a hotel room and you're not allowed to do anything at night not allowed to see those dark dark starry skies and so you couldn't evolve any Pokemon that evolved at night and my question was why are there so many dark types that only evolve at night what's the deal dark types like Weavile and a lowland Radek aid and abs to goon that's how we say it in the midst Midwest Oh obstacle oh yeah you know no no oh yeah the you could find this Pokemon at the lake of outrage if there's a sandstorm going on which is completely irrelevant to anything to do with this Pokemon because it's going to get hurt in a sandstorm and it also shares its ability with its psychic cousin although it's super effective against its a second cousin so well who was the Pokemon last week two weeks ago I'm doing circles camber belated it's Hara blasts our bus has no cousins it has no family it's brie ombre on there you go and I have actually a complete I have a complete collection of eeveelutions that I only caught at the lake of Rage outraged me to not evolve a single Eevee in this game and that's how I got all of them my daily pick up a rock walk wander and get a rock get a rock get an eeveelution gonna rock it get a diva we shoot two to three rocks every day sorry Andy I gotta check on my little sales guy up on Stowe on sight or is that but it's still on side is that where he sells ya items yeah Evie cannot evolve and do s beyond or Umbreon in FireRed and LeafGreen due to their lack of time system in order to obtain them and add them to your pokedex you must trade them from ruby sefar or emerald evolve there and then trade them back or you have to get Colosseum or Yale darkness see that's how they get you to always buy born bye bye bye bye bye and I do according to the diamond in Perl pokedex Umbreon Glaceon and Leafeon have identical footprints Umbreon is the only non psychic pokémon to have the ability synchronize oh I wish I had known that Umbreon was designed by Atsuko nin nin Tschida who designed pikachu and Charmander Charmeleon Charizard fun fact not bad because that Umbreon designs pretty choice is very as a design sylveon as well I'm Brienne is tied with mega Gyarados and Hoopa and bound for the highest special defense of all dark types silviana stop for the highest special defense or tied with sylveon tied with Leafeon for the louis-based special attack of all evil ooh shion's and in the year of Pokemon poll presented by the Pokemon company in 2020 Umbreon was voted the most popular Gen 2 Pokemon and the most popular Eevee evolution receiving 67,000 votes dang take that Umbreon haters who could hate an Umbreon that's soft and fluffy are they soft and fluffy it all looks off wait sealskin to me prize with seal skin is surprisingly soft and fluffy two things see here one thing seals and kittens have in common is they're soft and fluffiness that's true alright do you want another always I was 890 of them everybody you get an additional clue this week because this Pokemon was relevant last week but I get to do it last week so now it's irrelevant but you get what you get cuz I ain't writing more here we go I recently been feeling nostalgic for my 80s R&B jams and added new additions album new addition to my iTunes library in doing so I had begun to wonder whether the biggest single from that album mr. telephone man would even be comprehensible to our younger audience what is a telephone man what is six one one why would an operator say please hang up and place your call again what is a party line there are several other almost incomprehensible references in the song and yet it is still a bop in the same way other once essential pokemon have gone by the wayside need someone to surf nah I have a bike for that fly me from spot to spot no we take air taxis here this week's pokemons made its debut in 2006 and has some viability for about 10 years when it was then made redundant as its particular skills were no longer necessary we can't quite say that it was sent out to pasture but maybe back to the dam instead unlike slowpoke this week's pokemons tale was never eaten in the game unlike its pre evolution it has never been made out of peanut butter in real world Canada though there is a sweet fried dough treat made in the fashion of this pokemons tale you can also eat the real thing though many recipes recommend cooking the tale over high heat and serving it with beans here in Minnesota some trappers would hunt this week's Pokemon for its tail and its fur but unfortunately there are not enough trapped each year to prevent this rodents population from becoming problematic some fascinating facts though its nose and ears seal closed when it goes underwater its nictitating membrane allows it to see underwater without irritation its lips actually close behind its front teeth so that it can hold things in its mouth without drowning there you go that's all your clues that's all you need to know to guess the Pokemon of the week well that's our episode for you guys I don't know how many people are working at home because normally people listen to podcasts on their commuting so maybe the shorter episode is better I guess we'll find out if you guys want to follow us on Twitter Greg is that white-winged is that washing the sink I am at dragging a lake if you need something to watch or just have some background noise in the background that isn't Jerry Springer you can have my twitch stream Jerry Springer is on during the day right I don't know Jerry Springer's on at all anymore Springer is not anymore Judge Joe Brown I think that's on during the day you are in a hole a friend like 3:30 GI Joe and transformers comes on right yeah I think Family Feud still on during the day what about Alan I think Alan still honor Alan is LLL be on for all eternity all right Alan is a national treasure so if you need something on in the background if you're working at home or you're working in an empty office I will be streaming a lot this week on twitch twitch TV slash pkmn cast

rotate out there will be a lot of animal crossing this week so if you want to come by say hi hang out I would appreciate that and if you're looking to exchange fruit also probably a good place to hang
