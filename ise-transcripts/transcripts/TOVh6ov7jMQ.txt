[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 260 eighth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I am your host SBJ and with me today I have will and I have a very sad announcement to make the battery on my original 3ds is weird oh yeah that's right what you can change the battery yeah no yeah we'll anderson cannot change the battery it's like two screws and you pull the pedal up do I look like a screwy kind of person uh we got Travis here today so Magikarp jump is ruining my life have you put money into it no no no I'm not that far it's just like I said like I said last week it's essentially a skinner box and it I don't have fun like it was fun at first because it's very cute it's not fun anymore because I've already seen all of the pretty pictures that can provide but I'm still playing it because I mean there's food that I could have my magic heart beat like I can't just wait I mean that I have three full training points like I gotta spend them I understand I will admit I'm probably the type of person whose brain is more captured by that type of mechanic than most but it just it's just nefarious and I want to escape it it's not even fun and I keep doing it yeah I'm still playing Magikarp jump as well I don't I think we'll probably not I haven't seen you move up in my leaderboard yeah I mean I got to level three and I thought that's a grand accomplishment let's leave it at that where are you right now Steve ranked 41 I think I might be a little higher let me see there was like two days I barely played because of life yeah I'm ranked 46 and I'd be having a luxury yeah I've maxed out the amount of motivation bonus you get to got an exciting show for you guys today we got some Pokemon news regarding Pokemon go and the new Pokemon mobile game that is already out in Japan and then we got some emails there's some vast amount of emails that we need to catch up on so we'll probably do a lot of that and then we have our Pokemon of the week and somewhere in there we'll probably talk about Magikarp jump a little bit more so that's our show for you guys today no no interview had anything this week just just just the three of us that was nice thank you little 11 a.m. singing for you guys 11 a.m. we're post noon here buddy you're the outlier settle down here let's just jump right into spoke bad news first bit of news here is the entire 52 episode first season of the Pokemon anime called Pokemon indigo league is now available on Amazon digitally the season is now available in 4 volumes 13 each Amazon claims these episodes are an quote h.d each of the each of the four volumes cost 21 99s for a total of 87 96 for the entire season due to the way Amazon has configured episodes can be purchased individually for $2.99 each because they are quote HD note that this is a real this release uses standard seasons as seen on Pokemon calm yeah this is off bubble pedia by the way let me break it down for you guess you can just buy the DVDs I know they're DVDs but you can buy the entire first season of Pokemon indigo league for less than $30 on Amazon in DVD format and I gotta agree with that way you don't have to spend 80 something to do it yeah and I gotta agree with Snorlax Snorlax monster we've had him on the show one of the news reporters on boba pedia but there's no way these episodes look better oh it's kind of like me trying to play Pokemon X on my original original original 3ds it certainly doesn't look better I don't know if I don't know if the quotes around HD were added by you or if those quotes were originally in the article but I think it's apt to include them although I have not seen this Amazon feed of them but a lot of the time we refer to 720p as high-definition and I mean DVDs can do that as far as I'm oh I think 720p is just like DVD quality and yet we still call it HD so maybe that's what's going on who knows I haven't seen the hands maybe maybe you get every pore in Brock's beautiful face in this high-definition remaster Wind Waker HD version of the Pokemon dark skin is flawless I mean well do you think that there are people who don't have pores because regardless of the beauty or quality or as you say flawlessness of one skin everyone still has pores his makeup is flawless sure but it covers every single pore smooths everything out so beautiful porcelain all right now misty there is a disaster huh that's a walking trainwreck right there I was watching the southern moon episodes and I'm all caught up now the DVR or whatever PlayStation view uses to play to like realize what show you're watching decided to play it might have been no it was a Johto episode sorry yes cuz I remember the amazing Giotto theme song and Brock is back as well as misty it was the Chikorita episode none of that matters what matters is one the johto theme song is amazing and two the animation is so bad in that season the lines I thought you didn't care about animation I don't yeah I don't like I would I would watch nori man you're right you're absolutely right like I don't know why you're trying to troll me you're absolutely right I'm just saying that I can recognize bad animation just like I could go to an art museum and recognize good and bad art but anyways the animation was so bad I didn't realize how it aged that being said that didn't stop me from watching the episode and realizing that chikorita beat Charizard at some point that chikorita is a real trick Arita I think chikorita also be Pikachu that theme song is real good yeah it's the best of them all it's quite good second button is here is Pokemon movies 1 through 3 go addition to be released in Australia and New Zealand in July these will be to release on DVD and blu-ray on July 5th 2017 this release includes the first three pokemon movies and their corresponding Pikachu shorts this will include the English dub the DVD release will be DVD Region four and the blu-ray release will be blu-ray region B and both are released in PAL while the DVD release will be broadly available the blu-ray release will be exclusive to JB hi-fi pokey collection will be giving will hold giveaways for both in the future although no details have been announced specifically this movie set includes Mewtwo strikes back the power of one and the spell of the unknown and Thai and the Pikachu shorts are Pikachu's vacation Pikachu's rescue adventure and Pikachu and Pichu I didn't realize the second movie was called the power of one I just thought it was called Pokemon the movie 2000 Pokemon the movie 2000 the power of one that is actually the great subtitle deadlock I have no idea go for it now Travis is right yeah I'm never wrong I mean name one time I've ever been wrong on this show it's not like last week when I said you had to tap on all of the corsola and Luvdisc but I was completely wrong because you don't have to do that at all in Magikarp jump I've never been wrong did you find that out just by letting them pass and seeing what happened or didn't know someone in slack corrected me I can for who but someone did yeah we're just the spearhead of a giant internet brain that solves all riddles for us and then we speak out the answer good did you guys have a preferred movie out of those three oh I don't even remember what the third one he said was the anti one it's where I thought and I was Pokemon no Pokemon the movie 2000 is the lugia legendary birds and lugia so proud I mean the third movies kind of it's kind of weird that nth azad ABS oh yeah yep yeah dad daddy ante I mean Indo if I were to pick one to watch like today I would pick the first movie but I will admit that's purely out of nostalgia and know the fact that I know it the but like if I go to a Pokemon movie it's because I like it's sort of like a the first one is a bit of a comfort movie it's not necessarily like fantastic but if I were to pick one of those three where I was like where I wanted to see one that I don't remember very well I would probably pick the Entei one because the only thing I remember about it is the Entei is the little girl's dad and that's weird and I would want to know how that happened because I don't remember it shows up at the end somewhere in that ends a movie yeah I've only ever seen the first one so I would watch either of the other two how have you not seen the other Pokemon movies though those were all in theaters well yeah when I was 27 and I was doing adult things and not being that creepy 27 year old going to the Pokemon movie this is off BGR comm meet pokey land the latest Pokemon app for iOS and Android and the month since I you're gonna say there's gonna be like a pokemon park at Disney World or something and I got all excited yeah now this is uh this is the Pokemon Rumble spin-off and the months since Pokemon goes launch in the App Store and Google Play the Pokemon company has released two other mobile games Pokemon duel and Pokemon Magikarp jump the trend continues on Wednesday when the Pokemon company announced yet another Pokemon app called pokey land in pokey land players will collect toy versions of their favorite Pokemon and battle throughout a series of islands in attempt to reach the top of champion tower all in all this basically sounds like a mobile version of the Pokemon Rumble series which features many of the same elements including the way it looks at least that's my opinion including the way it looks according to the Japanese website pokey land requires an internet connection and links up with your Nintendo account which will allow you to bring your me into the game I believe this is the first Pokemon game that connects via your Nintendo account as you battle your way through the island you will also find gear that will let you strength strengthen your toy Pokemon team starting today Android owners in Japan will have the opportunity to participate in a limited alpha this test will feature six islands fifty two stages 134 different kinds of Pokemon testers will also be able to climb the tower to the fifteenth floor which will be even taller in the final game players who participate in the alpha test won't be able to transfer the progress over to the final game the Alpha ends on June 9th there's no word yet if the game will come to the US that said Pokemon Rumble and Magikarp of the original Pokemon Rumble and Magikarp jump made it over here so pokey land will probably do the same yeah Pokemon Rumble world you were able to have a me but I'm not sure if it was the same me as your Nintendo me if you know what I'm saying oh yeah yeah I think they mean first mobile game because obviously Me's are on 3ds so anybody could access that API and put me into their game so here's the important thing Ken I take my outfits from miitomo which I have a huge selection of outfits of various glory and and use them in this new game I don't predict oh yeah I don't think so what other Nintendo so miitomo obviously accesses your me I'm pretty sure Super Mario run accesses your me you're talking just mobile games yeah just ios and android games v does Fire Emblem access you're me not that I know of I don't think so either unless it unless you can use it as like an avatar but I don't think so but even if it doesn't access hear me when you log into I was gonna say Club Nintendo but it's not called that anymore when you log into nintendo.com and then go to the rewards section there are rewards for both Super Mario run and for Fire Emblem and miitomo I don't even know what they're called but you can get like items in the game by spending your coins Fire Emblem you could get like a fruit like you get five free orbs just by logging into Nintendo calm and then redeeming it and then you could get like another two orbs for like 200 coins or something so if pokey land is also accessing your Nintendo account which no other iOS or Android mobile game does I'm sure there would be some something tied in to Nintendo calm if with your coins my guess is that this game isn't going to be too great I mean was any rumble series game really like that great they were nice I mean that that's kind of what I'm saying because Pokemon Rumble can be fun I think but and there are some of those games that I do like but I think anyone who even anyone who really likes Pokemon Rumble would admit that the gameplay is pretty simple to your general Pokemon Rumble experience and we were taking a concept that's already quite simple like doesn't have a lot of depth to it and then making a mobile version of that it's probably even simpler to the point of my guess would be not it wouldn't be that great but we'll see I mean I I played a heck of a lot of Pokemon Rumble worlds that's good free to start one will on the 3ds yeah well I mean you never had to put money into it but you could play the whole thing without putting money into it but it was just like you could only get so far so fast um but Steve you were my king in that game as I should have been I mean that was fun and uh I mean I can see how it can move that that's an easy move to mobile because like the Pokemon don't do that much so it's easily you know just tapping on the screen is easy enough to translate the moves and stuff into if they maintain the same mechanics here's a question for both of you because you both like Rumble or Rumble to some extent and I will say that my favorite Rumble is the one on Wii U because it had multiplayer and it had the one the wannabe amiibos which I thought were just charming in their own right but that being said question is does it upset you or the opposite of does it were excite you I guess upset or excite you that down set me it does it down set you that they took what has always been a console / handheld choice and now pushed it into mobile I know they've got to make money then yeah I'm pretty diversify folks I'm pretty down set about it aye aye I mean they've done like the fact that they did with that with Fire Emblem and I hadn't played Fire Emblem before makes me want like they did that with Fire Emblem and I had never played it before and now I want to buy the new game when it comes out on switch so like I'm proof that that's a pretty good strategy so I'm very down set about it so so Steve have you ever heard of Willy Sutton no as it sounds like a country music star and incorrect Willy Sutton it was a bank robber in the early 20th century early 1900s and he's particularly famous because he was caught and somebody asked him Willy why do you rob banks and his answer was because that is where the money is so yes I expect T PCI to make mobile games because guess what that is where the money is yeah to make money I think what Steve is saying is like in a perfect world like where like like week we all recognize that there's a lot of money in the mobile app market I don't think anyone's contesting that I think what Steve is saying a lot easy money if if the incentives were or different if you know like if it were an even choice between making a mobile game or making a 3ds game and they made a mobile game would that upset you or DOM is that guy go I've got I've got both I guess I'm down set yeah I mean I have no turtle in this aquarium but I was just I was just curious what you what you both thought that being said clearly the mobile game thing has worked for them and I think that's fine who's buying who's buying the rumble games like I would I would have to imagine out of the games they have sold whether that's pokemon snap or pokemon stadium or pokemon - or poképark i would wager to bet that the pokemon rumble games are probably on the lower end of sales compared to the other spin-off games so when mmm there are some people who really like the rumble games it's because they're more like action II than your typical Pokemon game yeah but actually you mean like you mean spamming the a button yeah like you could probably - do you brother play through that whole game without looking at the screen and just mashing a now you kind of aim you gotta aim the Pokemon - but it has to like walk around and go places I'm only I'm only one person out of you know millions of Pokemon fans but I played one Rumble game and I got the gist of it and they haven't really changed that formula since so it always made it very troubling for me well see formulating or retelling is a well established to pay like thirty nine dollars for the 3ds one which I can't believe that game came out at full price for what it was hey there was a lot of story at net game I think that we I think the Wii U one was which was digital only was twenty and that one that one had to have done the worst just based on the Wii U's install base and then they did the free one on 3ds which probably made them a decent amount of money or maybe not but clearly they made some sort of money to make now this one hey remember Pokemon Conquest yeah what we're talking about they're not that game so good actually I wonder this this is actually what I wondered now is they released Pokemon shuffle on 3ds and then they eventually moved it over to Android and 3ds alright Android and iOS iPhone I wonder if shuffle started making way more money on iOS than it did on 3ds and so they saw that and because both Rumble and shuffle were free on 3ds they were they thought oh let's move it over to I Oh s and Android because that is where people are more likely to spend money than on 3ds I don't know what your what you're telling me is we're gonna get a face Raiders port yes made by the Pokemon only and the only face you see is bass Cohen's you I would I'd play that for a minute I prefer it was like Reggie's face or something speaking of money it was everyone's favorite Pokemon Reggie fils-aime a yep he only says his name this is off the verge calm knee antic earns up to 50 cents per visit to sponsored Pokemon go stops that's a lot of money hot dang hot yeah we're gonna we're gonna get it speaking of money Travis we're gonna we're gonna go deep wowsers I've always said money is no good in the bank the antic is surely proving that point knee antic is making lots of money off sponsor Pokemon go stops and particularly crashed out during the height of the game's popularity last year interviews with Brazil's global paper and TechCrunch knee antic said that it charges anywhere from 15 cents to 50 cents for each visitor that the game draws to a sponsored location there's some uncertainty about the exact cost of a visit but the figures imply that in the antic could be making millions of dollars off players the antics VP of strategic partnerships matthew de fête told global Globo sorry that its partners pay 15 cents for every visitor and the company has already attracted fifty five hundred million visitors around the world every activated McDonald's store in Japan attracts two thousand visitors a day he says when TechCrunch double-checked those numbers with the company in the antics said it was actually a antics said that in actuality sponsorships cost up to fifty percent per unique visit using fee eighths fifteen cent pricing and his five hundred million visitors figure that could translate to seventy five million dollars in revenue at fifty per visit that revenue would jump up to 250 million in December in the antic announced that it was partnering with Starbucks who turned 7800 stores across the u.s. into pokey stops or gyms that deal coincided with the debut of Pokemon go themed Frappuccino which was designed to entice players spirit is also offering a partnership with the antic to turn oh sorry sprint is also offering a partnership with the antique to turn 10,000 stores into gyms and pokey stops it isn't clear how popular the game is following its viral release in the summer stop this article to say that as of last night it was number 19 in the top grossing apps in iOS but still over the past few months Niantic has launched new Pokemon debuted the game on the Apple watch expanded into new markets Pokemon goes publisher the Pokemon company says the following release of game freak's Pokemon Sun and Moon its profits profits rose to one hundred and forty three point three million nearly twenty six times the profit it made the previous year clearly neither in the antic or the Pokemon company are going to let Pokemon go die yet especially if everyone's still profiting big time alright so before you comment on this I have off of second Toto calm Pokemon company's profits they couldn't get they couldn't NAB first todo so they're thinking NAB that that VIP URL that premium URL I don't think so yeah I don't think so so the Pokemon company has 1919 fiscal years in its history so number 19 is the year of Pokemon Sun and Pokemon go and Pokemon moon so we'll just start with their fifteenth fiscal year here they made a sixteen point six million dollars of of net profit right correct because that would be very very small if it were gross yeah net profit their sixteenth year they made ten point six million dollars their 17th fiscal year eighteen point four million dollars their 18th physical year always stressed that this is no game no main series game this year 5.6 million and their 19th year is a hundred and forty three point three million so let me just well well let me just go through this is one time fifteen fifteenth year 16 million sixteenth year 10 million seventeenth year 18 million eighteenth year five million this last year a hundred and forty three million they can finally get those gold-plated toilet seats in the executive bathroom wait not even gold-plated just gold hmm gold and silver no what's a silver toilet seat very cool it's a lot of money is the thing with over a hundred sixty million debt like how is the majority of that boost from Pokemon go or did Pokemon like I don't know that much about financial performance of the of the main series of Pokemon games I just like them and play them a lot did Sun and Moon do considerably better than for example X&Y or is that jump just because Pokemon go came out I can pull up the sales numbers but I do know that the last time I checked Sun and Moon were geared to pass the sales of x and y but were in the same ballpark so it must just that difference must just be Pokemon go then wowsers people really do like that poky bug thing on the phones hokey bug polka bugs you go out poke at your phone you get the polka bugs Oh a Pokemon girl so what do you tat one okay so Sun and Moon came out so there was no game in the no main series game in the year they made 5 million and then the year before that was Omega Ruby alpha sapphire the year before that was X&Y and then the the first fifth the first year I read off the 15 fiscal year was pokemon black and white 2 and then in 2011 there was no game I guess I mean there was but I'm looking at the Japanese dates here so that being said if you look I think I think it's obvious that Pokemon go had probably the biggest impact as well as it being their 20th anniversary so I think we also got poked in this that year we also got Pokemon shuffle on iOS we also got what else did we get sorry we got those monthly Pokemon distributions too like Toys R Us and Game Stop and and everything thus they did the whole twitch thing for two days of all the pokemon movies so they did a lot of things last year and that's that's kind of why I've been a little frustrated recently because I haven't really done anything this year I mean Magikarp jump in Pokemon duel and everything but they haven't done anything big yet which it blows my mind that look at how successful they were last year and they're letting I feel like they're just letting that fall off they're leaving the money on the table so so 2015 weeding any game so is that where is that where Pokemon Z was supposed to be that has to be it right yeah perhaps they're looking at that perhaps that they're looking at that huge jump in profits and saying holy cow holy cow something something changed here that's something being Pokemon go that was a like a bit of an experiment on our parts and it paid off a lot so maybe we should take we should redirect our efforts a little bit to try and create some more projects that are similar to that so maybe this year they're spending more of their efforts like brainstorming not like brainstorming but like launching new projects and stuff so that's why we're not seeing much cut like coming out this year because probably caught them by surprise how much Pokemon go made them and they're like wow okay I think I caught everyone by surprise yeah so I so I guess what I'm saying is it would be conceivable that this strategy is we had no idea how great the strategy would turn out for us let's try to similar project so maybe they're like in the planning stages of similar things I mean that's pure conjecture on my part but it would make sense right yeah no that makes sense so they're seventeen fiscal year is when Omega Ruby alpha sapphire came out that was more or less a worldwide release that was the year they made 18 million and then the year after they made 5.6 million obvious like Nabi not obviously but but obviously another team was working on Pokemon Z or had to be working on something of the sort because as a company if you're guaranteeing so II there were seer which was out of out of these years which was their 16th fiscal year which was the year before that was the year before Omega Ruby alpha sapphire that's when they did Pokemon X&Y they made ten million and I don't know how their years exactly roll over so that doesn't matter too much but even if that was their worst a year at ten million and you look at the 18th fiscal year of no game they could have made 5 million in net profit at least if they would have released Z and yet for some reason they didn't yeah so when I was talking to people in slack Nick kind of made a good point of if they if they missed that deadline of November or whenever they were supposed to release it if they couldn't finish it in time and they missed it and they were gearing up for this 20th anniversary which included Sun and Moon you just can't release Z anymore it's not like you're gonna release Z in March and then all of a sudden release Sun and Moon in November which is what they did because they announced Sun and Moon in March so you're not gonna go oh here's Pokemon Z by the way there's another Pokemon game coming out because people are either going to go do - well you're either you have the people that buy anything Pokemon related like the three of us or you have people that are very content with just one game every now and then whether that's oh I bought black-and-white but I'm not gonna buy black and white - oh I bought X&Y but I'm not going to buy Omega Ruby alpha sapphire oh I guess I'm getting Z so I I don't need Sun and Moon or in Reverse oh set of moons coming out and that's a whole new game and it has all new Pokemon why would I go back to Kalos I just think it's very interesting what you're saying makes sense it does make sense it's just I mean I hope all those people have been fired if their planning was that poor and their ability to deliver on time was that bad that they missed out on an entire game and that's how I got fired by the Pokemon company and Game Freak yeah I'm just so curious of what happened there because it's not like Z would have been a failure it would have netted them five million dollars and I don't think any company's gonna scoff at oh don't worry guys we'll make - yeah we'll be okay with five million dollars this year but hey if we would release that game we would have been at least at least ten billion dollars that's so much more money its net profit that means that was after they paid for everything that's a net profit of five more million dollars not guaranteed you're right it's not guaranteed they safety not guaranteed they could have sold nothing I just think those numbers are very interesting after like yeah you can look at the 146 million go wow that's that's that's that's unbelievable I think that five million dollar numbers way more interesting than the then that 146 million dollar number because we were alive and we were outside and we were in the deep end of the aquarium when Pokemon go hit that's all I got I don't know what any of those words mean so sure I think that was our last news so this is the part where like music comes in and we take a break right yeah yeah I believe so I'm just double-checking here oh sorry I got so carried away one more one more quick bit of news here this is off Pokemon calm sorry 3ds dot Pokemon it's - gl calm yeah I really they really got the good domains here over a pokémon Global Link aa small Pokemon make it big in the tiny tourney there's nothing a little bit to be party laughing there's nothing little about the fun to be had in the tiny tourney online competition build your best team using only Pokemon equal to or less than one meter which is three feet tall then direct them in double battles in Pokemon Sun and Moon participants will receive Gallade ight garbodor ight and lopunny ight mega stones the entire national pokedex is available for you to build your team as long as the Pokemon is under the maximum height requirement plus mythical and some legendary Pokemon will not be permitted but the key word here is some you can use the pokey transporter to transfer Pokemon from earlier games Pokemon can hold items including Z crystals but mega stones will not be allowed check the regulations and complete list of Pokemon and items that are not permitted in the tiny tournament tiny tourney registration begins June 14th competition starts June 23rd competition ends June 25th 15 battles per day you will need a pokémon trainer club account and your own copy of Pokemon Sun and Moon with a party of eligible Pokemon they don't have a list of allowed or not a lot of Pokemon even though it says check the list it says the list will be available when registration starts so after June 14th yeah but they're showing us Andy gasps and a Pachirisu and a mimic you and a munchlax munchlax sorry so those are clearly or not probably none of whom will get used maybe mimic you ah picture issue has the what follow me that's pretty popular no duh so someone on one of the so there's a competitive battling subreddit called stunfisk someone on that subreddit that is user super GST er 17 made a post that is a link to a Google Doc spreadsheet that has all of the pokémon that are under a meter tall organized by all their base stats anyone want to hazard a guess as to what what pokemon has the highest base stat total under a meter is it cortana is it me no music bait using someone mu is also mu is also mythical so it's not included car Tana is very close car Tana is number 4 on the list at 570 and it's unclear whether car Tana will be allowed as an ultra beast and it's also unclear and actually the 4 above it are all unclear for various reasons the three above it are as L Fuchs E and mass prett each at 580 unclear whether that will be allowed because we don't know which legendary Pokemon will be allowed although I believe they will be because I don't think they've been banned and things in the past and then number one is also dubious because it's wishy-washy school form and it really depends on if they count the height of school form or the height of what is though just a lone wishy-washy called I don't remember where she just wishy-washy uno uno wishy-washy is what you have she so I have to figure out if they allow wishy-washy school for him but discounting those by 6 which are all dubious for various reasons the next highest one is porygon Z and number 7 535 based at total wouldn't you would just put porygon 2 there and give it an an Evo light I mean you would but just for pure statistics take say sure that is the yeah why is pouring on to better than poor Ganzi because the ability not just because porygon 2 already has like porygon z when you evolve into porygon z it doesn't really gain much other than offensive capability so considering that you've already got decent bulk on porygon 2 and then slap on an EVO light and that decent book gets even better and it has a great supporting move pool a better supporting move pool honestly than it does offensive although there are some pretty decent things you can do with porygon Z and like singles do well that tournament starts like I said on June 23rd registration starting on June 14th so nine days when this episode goes up and that is our last bit of news so what we'll do is we will take a quick break and we come back we will do emails and Pokemon of the week [Music] [Music] in good condition in 2017 and we are back from our break before we get into emails let me let me spit spit about a new series here spit meaning talk that's what the cool kids are saying I'm glad you've clarified how is the D treating you will I know that kids are still calling Washington DC the D how is the district well yeah it was pleasant until my air conditioning broke and now it's a little roasty-toasty Oh like let me tell you I can't live without air conditioning I hardly believe that so starting this week the week this podcast goes up I am starting a new podcast believe it or not a Pokemon related podcast so I am starting a another Pokemon podcast in all attempts to finally get rid of Travis and will huh yeah it's taking you a while but you've finally done it finally it is going to be a new podcast completely focused on the Pokemon anime and we will be starting we as in it will be a show featuring myself and Irene we're gonna be starting with that's fun and cute that's it that's nice we're gonna be starting with season 20 so Sun and Moon and we're gonna be doing one Episode a week of the Sun and Moon anime the first two weeks you will get bonus episodes as we try to quickly catch up to the current episode which is episode 12 as of this recording so doing a Sun a moon anime so the catch to this podcast is it will be only for patreon backers at the four dollar a month level so if you're donating one dollar a month and you are interested you would have to up that to four dollars a month which is which really just comes down to a dollar a week this has no effect on it's super effective it's super effective we'll still come out every Monday will still always be free all that jazz that I've always talked about this is just some extra work that I'm doing to see if people are interested because I know that a lot of people do like the anime so patreon has a cool feature where it does allow podcasts to go through there so I will be uploading all the podcasts through patreon once you are a gold backer which is four dollars more a month or higher whether that's you know a hundred dollars a month or or six dollars a month it will give you an RSS feed once the first episode is live you after that RSS feed and your iTunes app or your Google Play app or your pod pod stitcher app podcaster pocket cast that's what I was thinking of your pocket cast app and then just like any RSS feed when new episodes come you don't have to worry about anything you don't blog into patreon it's just that initial login gets you that RSS feed and then you're good to go at least that's how I believe it works that's what patreon that's what everything I've read so hopefully that goes very smoothly so yeah that I will send a patreon post I'll post about it but if you're if you're interested in that and you want to upgrade to $4 cool if not if that's not for you also cool you still got it super effective so yeah I think that's all are you talking about the anime ah so with that big said let's uh let's tackle some Pokemon emails some emails here so they any questions comments or concerns you can send those over to SB j @p command cast comm or you can go to poll why don't we call them poke emails Hulk emails hmm that's really good we should do that couldn't you get emails and X&Y know you got like FaceTime calls yeah they were like 3d holographic video calls yep in in well in pokemon mystery dungeon you could attach letters to pokemon and then they would carry them around places for you they didn't have a clever name not the pokemon mystery yeah probably you also got a Pokemon podcast calm and hit contact can't hit the contact button those are those are two ways you can send emails this is from Tom C Rochester New York hi guys I'm a fairly new listener and I really enjoy the podcast I got into the podcast via the Sun and Moon series I recently jumped back into Pokemon with moon after originally playing pokemon blue in 2001 since then I decided to catch up on the games in between I am currently playing through alpha sapphire which leads me to my question for the podcast it's been mentioned on the past few episodes that one sign that Sun and Moon may have also been built for switch is that there can be substantial slow down while playing even on the new Nintendo 3ds the thing is I've also noticed slowdown at times when playing alpha sapphire on the new Nintendo 3ds horde battles three-on-three or even when there is more than one pokemon on the screen that has a quote more active animation what are your thoughts on this since there are slowdowns in both games does this change your opinion of why their slowdown in Sun and Moon are we just under the same spell while we hanker for stars news Tom I think there's more than just that as the reason why an indicator of why it would be having a switch presence I'm not gonna say move to switch but having a switch version of the game because I think they also have taken the the graphics right the image files yeah little models and ported them and they poured out to 1080p quite easily and it's a nice experience yeah the slowdown is just one of many reasons why people including myself think that they built this for a more powerful system other than the 3ds aka the switch yeah well I think for me the biggest thing is how little actually uses how how unimportant the lower screen is in the game I mean the map is very it's cool that there's always a map there but it's not super important to me that's the biggest piece of evidence so yeah your point is good that like it's not new to have framerate drops in the game but but I think I agree with my co-host here that it's worth that alone you I think you would be unequivocally right that this doesn't really point anywhere but it's more of the fact of the other pieces of evidence with which it is packaged that make that make it as well seem like a piece of evidence towards that conclusion yeah I think those are three good points the bottom screen is useless the slowdown and the fact that people have ported them to 1080p and those and don't we already know that Game Freak is working on something for the Nintendo switch yes which that's my that's my no it's not like that it's more like oh you're doing the like what is the sweater it's like the click yeah it's very difficult to do with one's mouth I hear ya ah nice the emails from Christina from Sunland California hey I was trying to send an email and I was having trouble figuring out how to do this so hopefully I did this right and wanted to share a story with you guys so I was so excited when Sun and Moon was released and I was sort of following along with you guys playing then near the end of the game around the sixth gym or so I was not feeling very well so I was not playing as much I would have wanted at one point I was playing and I felt sleepy as you do occasionally when you do not feel well when I set down my DS it slipped off the surface I was trying to place it on and slip into a bowl of dog water couldn't fix it and didn't have the money to replace my DS right away I'm assuming three DS by the way and I had to wait a quite a long time but I no longer really remember quite what I was doing in the middle of the time I stopped I was trying to build a living pokedex and I missed out on a few releases of rare Pokemon time limited limited time releases I've been debating restarting the game after transferring my current pokemon game into Pokemon Bank most likely but it doesn't have the same appeal as it did when I began so then I thought about your slack community but I don't know how to get there or anything about slack I know it's patreon exclusive but even though I don't have a lot of money I'd actually love to support you guys traditional stuff I don't have a favorite though but do you love to hear from Irene identify most with will I love hearing about competitive Pokemon from Travis even though I will probably never compete of course that all works if I haven't gotten anyone confused with anyone else I saw the video podcast I saw a video of the podcast once and I was really thrown for a loop because no one looked the way I imagined everyone did don't worry spj I love you too for everything you do thanks Christina it's a nice email I'm sorry your 3ds fell into dog water it sounds like the game was saved because they talked about transferring to Pokemon pink yeah are you disparaging dog water for some reason because there's nothing wrong with dog water I don't know but just the fact that you have to qualify that it's dog dog waters lying to slightly just no not if you change it every day and I think it's kind of to differentiate from the concept that she might have bowls of water just sitting at her house shall I yeah my LAN movie signs those are cups of water DUP bowls of water cups bowls it's all the same thing to your question about slack it's a it's a buck a month and then Steve will send you a link to join and then you can either download the slack app or use there's just a URL you can direct your browser to and talk in slack there everyone is really nice and fun and groovy and funny it's a fun crowd yeah like Travis said there's there's an app you can download you can download an app on your PC your Mac your iPhone your Android phone and I don't think anyone's using a Windows Phone anymore I think those are gone but also you could just go to a web browser like Internet Explorer Safari or Firefox or Google Chrome and just type in the the web link we give you and then log in so it is pretty easy but if you have more questions or if anyone has more questions about slack and patreon you can just shoot me an email and I'll be more than happy to answer your specific questions because what what we're giving is kind of general information here as for like restarting your game man that's that's tough like I totally know that feeling because I've had that feeling for Fallout 3 actually I got 30 or 40 hours into Fallout 3 and then my friend was playing technically my roommate at the time was also playing on my ps3 and they saved over my save with their save and it was like a fresh save so they were only like one or two hours in and that was like a gut-wrenching feeling of I don't want to start this over like there's a certain enjoyment at a point sometimes not all the time but sometimes like re going through what you've just lost is very hard for that to be enjoyable cuz you you wouldn't have done that like a lot of people restart games but to restart a game because you have to is like a totally different feeling this might be a this shouldn't be a controversial opinion I don't think but it might be given the nature of Pokemon fans if the prospect of playing Pokemon right now it doesn't seem fun don't do it Pokemon is a weird thing where like you know it it's not quite an animal crossing where you are actively punished for not playing every day but it is the type of game that has a certain momentum or inertia to it where if you haven't been playing for a while it's doesn't seem like it would be fun so unless you have like a specific thing motivating you to play like oh I really want to as you say like you feel really motivated to complete a living Dex or you want to breed a team to play competitively or on you've got a friend who you want to battle with a lot like unless you have what like an external motivator getting you back into it I don't necessarily think like forcing yourself to enjoy a thing you're not motivated to do is really gonna work like play another game and it'll probably be fun and then maybe something will come along and that'll be that all make you think oh I should play Pokemon again and actually wanting to play a video game is sort of in my as a prerequisite to having it be a fun experience ya know making sure that it's not work like yeah right I kind of like interspersed my pokemon playing with Monster Hunter playing or after I finished the game I'll play Pokemon when I want to build teams for various competitions and such and that's what keeps my interest but you know if you need to take a break for a little while just to let the story drain out and then you can get back into it again go for it I agree I think my biggest stop to playing Pokemon games is just the 3d s itself stop hitting the 3ds that's like I kind of want to go back and play red blue and yellow but then I think well then I gotta play on 3ds if it was on switch then we'd be talking the switch is really good it is really good it's everything I really want that's why that monster under announcement got me so excited because it's exactly what I want ah so excited okay so this is from Kevin from Atlanta Georgia messaged dear it's surely entertaining huh I happen to recall that in the anime there is a superhero who bases his entire prep presence slash persona on gligar if each of you suddenly became a superhero based on a Pokemon using their powers and abilities who would you pick and what would you call yourself and what would your collective adventures taint team name be sincerely frequent contributor Kevin aka Koopa Prez man I'm just not into superheroes at all this is really weird because this hasn't been announced anywhere but the episode comes out some well I guess probably the day you're listening to this if you're listening to it on Monday June 5th because which i think is when this comes out we're launching season 2 of very random encounters and we're playing the old Marvel Super Heroes uh role-playing game from the 80s so I'm really in a superhero mindset anyway so it's like I I just had to come up with a personality for a superhero that was randomly assigned to me and now I'm being asked to do it again and it's quite intimidating I'll make my own it's a tough one easy I would be hawlucha and have a wrestling persona and all of halogen boobs are wrestling based so it's really boring but that's what you're getting oh I am I answer I think I would do I think I would do like slack off and it would I would like it would look like I was just like a sleep resting somewhere but then all of a sudden I would just like summon all of my it because I had been like the superpower would be like the more I rest the more energy I like consolidate and then could spring upon you and just wreck you in one quick movement and then go right back to sleep that'd be a fun power so I would be high dreamin and I would have high drag on stuff like me and my high dragon would go and wreck stuff and I guess the name would be the human sloth is what I would be yeah and then what's our what's our team name so we have a weird sloth we have a three-headed dragon beast and then a wrestler the Polk Avengers that's so bad I aim at something now the Justice League of Kanto what about assists like the Pokemon move but it's also we assist the people of pokey world but that's better I like I like the concept of it being based off like a move like we could be the seismic toss there's wait screw what we're moving on in gars from Latvia Wrightson bin guard sorry I'm butchering your name I apologize rights and hey I recently started a new job which requires little attention to be put in that's my kinda job and I thought of listening to some podcasts to pass the time so I checked the Play Store for some podcast app downloaded one and reopened it but then I kind of got confused because I did not think of any topics I would actually like to listen about and the first thing that crossed my mind was Pokemon and I found you guys I have listened to your most recent episode and realized that it's really wonderful and I decided to go back to all your episodes from the beginning it's the earliest I found on the podcast app was episode 49 so I started there and I've been listening at work each day for about two to three weeks now I am currently on episode 76 the podcast is getting more and more awesome you have made me fully indulged into Pokemon and I've decided that I want to finish all the main games start with Pokemon go and I'm currently out the last gym battle what I kind of like in listening to your podcast episodes is the feeling that I'm making a journey together with a super effective team currently Sun and Moon has already been out for some while but in my journey with you guys black and white 2 was only about to come out the fields are simply amazing I realized I really like Pokemon the anime is ok but the games are just otherworldly and to be able to experience how it all processed and grew together with your experiences is just amazing well that's all I just wanted message and show some some support and I hope the show will still be running when I'm through the rest of the episodes thank you for that email there's no question them but I will say the reason you only found episode 49 is because most podcast apps including I would probably say the two popular ones Google Play Music and iTunes they can only store 250 RSS feed episodes so since we're well over Episode two fit to fifty and there was many episodes in between like the Sun and Moon series and the X&Y series that's why you don't see episode 1 anymore because we're just so far past that but that doesn't mean that they don't exist if you go to the soundcloud page or you just manually enter the direct RSS feed in your podcast app it will show all of them it's just like iTunes store only shows 250 episodes at a time I mean I joke about how like on I joke about how much I how terrified it makes me that people listen to old episodes with me when I was a little height a literal high school student that weirds me out a lot I mean I I bet if you're a listener you can imagine how strange that would be if you are in my place mainly it's just like it's I don't remember what happens on those episodes and it's still really weird feeling to think that people today are listening to me say things that I don't remember saying from like five years ago it's weird and wild and and I guess kind of flattering and an honoring yeah I've never said anything wrong or bad so enjoy every word that I mean like you were you were already like a like a like a big boy when we started when you started I think I was 17 or 18 as a mere blip in my life so far this message is from coal from New Jersey spj and crew I've I have a few questions for you guys number one if you were a member of the elite four which type

form number two if you could pick one Pokemon from each generation making a team of six leaving generation one out who would you pick my team would be Snorlax that already breaks the rule Oh leaving

oh oh yeah cinto is great too well it's Duke my character on the first season of mythical is from sin I'll do a couple more here I was trying to get through older emails there's all these new email questions Devon writes in hello I have a question regards to Pokemon go has the game changed your opinion about any specific Pokemon I used to overlook Bulava but now I think it's one of the cutest pokemons especially the Polka sorry he said they said Pokemon I added the s that was my fault especially like it's animations furet is also super cute it runs up to the animated app to the screen and scratches with regards to recent events I think the success is really based on the biome you live in I have I live in a desert / Mountain biome so water and grass pokemon water and grass events were pretty awesome the water event really filled up my pokedex and during the grass event we had tons of spawns that we don't ever see however the rock event was a dud it only increased spawns the only increased bombs of Slugma it was quite disappointing I don't think the event success should be based on which Pokemon are spawning go offer such a different experience based on your location it's really hard to judge the success or failure of the event thanks for your awesome podcast signing off lime Rickey no I would say the grass event was a dud because it was only three days compared to the adventure week which was like eight or nine days maybe a week maybe I'm either way the adventure week was twice as long if not longer than the grass week I didn't get grass pokemon I got like right at as and hoot hoots and not twos I got the same exact things I was always getting at my house or my work so that's why I would say that it was a dud adventure adventure week though was very noticeable in spawns we don't get a lot of rock type Pokemon in the Midwest yeah I'm just saying I'm not saying I'm not I wasn't seeing any grass pokemon i've Caterpie we Dalls piggies riot as not to code hoots like none of those regress and I like yeah I still saw those for adventure week but not nearly as often as I saw a slugma or a Geodude I think if I were gonna pick a c'mon that I like more because of Pokemon go I mean I have already always kind of liked ditto but I like how did out functions in Pokemon go that you don't know you're gonna catch it until you do I think that's really cool I agree I kind of do the other night and it was it was a very exciting moment even though I've had I have had dittos and Pokemon go in the past it was a Ratatat that turned into a ditto and it was oh oh yeah this is the thing oh cool yeah ditto ah yeah yeah yeah I just don't think people should be going out in the middle of the night and riding bikes on city streets yeah catching pokemons let me tell you hey here's the thing this is this is like kind of Pokemon go related in the city I'm living in I always say I live near Grand Rapids which is no longer really even true I am in a another town kind of in the area of Grand Rapids Michigan but they had a there's the thing last night or like all day yesterday that was like a pub crawl but you were encouraged to go on a bike from place with alcohol to place with alcohol so imagine all these people who have ingested like a lot of adult beverages that'll Tavor because it's in the sump at right and because it's in the summer they're also playing pokemon go so people on their phones playing pokemon go after imbibing a lot of um of not e-liquid like that's a recipe for disaster and the place i work happens to have like the whole front wall is just like glass windows so there were a ton of people that I saw with like phones in their hands playing Pokemon go that like almost or just did fall on their faces so don't do that I it's very difficult to operate a bike and a phone at the same time yep I've been ever since adventure week I've been very and I talked about this last week I said I was more compelled to finish my pokedex in Pokemon go than I have ever been in the main series games and I don't and I didn't know how to explain why I felt the way it did because that and in spoiler I still don't know why that is but to continue off my adventure week and to continue filling my Pokemon go pokin called up Micah I think this is knowledge but Mike and I live in the same city so I called up Micah and I said hey let's go to the lake park tonight I haven't been there since I haven't been there when it's the stops have been open and I want to catch Pokemon and I want to see how many stops actually got removed I want to know more details because I was at Lake Park for my interview with CBS when they interviewed me about Pokemon go but I didn't have time to like actually besides like the first area of the parking lot didn't have time to walk through the park and see what is there and what's not there I pick them up we head over to Lake Park we get at like park at 904 p.m. the stops are closed confirmation that these stops closed definitely at 9:00 I thought it was ten but it's it's at nine so stops are closed I said hey let's just walk through Lake Park I just want I want to count stops I want to see what's gone and what's not so first pokemon i see when we get to Lake Park is Totodile already excited I'm already extremely satisfied with this trip because I don't have a totodile to catch the Totodile I see that there's also a Grimer at Lake Park I don't have a Grimer I'm looking for the Grimer so we're walking through anyways we count that Lake Park had about seven to eight stops removed out of the entire park and it's not that big of a park there are still stops there it would still be a place that I would would it mind going in the future and then like two miles away I wasn't me maybe a mile away Snorlax appeared and I'd never Snorlax so I hooked it caught that Snorlax extremely satisfied again with the night I also got a cynic will that night too so mica says hey let's go over to Discovery World in the Milwaukee Art Museum let's there's a bunch of stops there let's just go over there so we were probably walking for about an hour an hour hour and a half around lake park so we go over there my concern was all the stops were gonna be closed because on both sides of the our museum and discover your world there are two parks and then Summerfest is over there as well and they weren't closed so we caught some Pokemon and then we saw a bunch of people leave discovery world on bikes I was like oh that's that's weird it's it's like 11 o'clock at night these where these bikers come from so in front of Discovery World there's what's called a bubbler they're one of those rent I don't know Travis or wheel if if you have these in your town but they're just bike rental places where you just pay for the hour yep yeah it's called DC bike share okay so I forget what the one is that's in Grand Rapids but yeah most of them are owned by a company called B cycle be cycle owns bubbler but they also own Madison bikes which is the same thing in Madison so it works universally there's also one stop they also own some in Indiana so I am now a bike member because of this but you can rent bikes in Indiana for example so we walk over and I go hey we should get a bike and Mike is like okay let's do it and I was like I was I wasn't being serious but now I'm curious how much it costs to rent a bike so I went up to the Machine and it's $3 for every half hour or you get unlimited rides for a month for $15 a month but I know that at the time so we rented a bike and I haven't ridden a bike since I was maybe 19 maybe 18 bikes are good and fun I instant like zero struggle I'm getting I know the old saying is like you never forget how to ride a bike but it couldn't be more true I got on that bike I knew how to ride that bike I had a great great time on that bike I biked like three miles that night and that's not I'm not saying that's a lot I'm just saying by 3 miles and we went from discovery world to the Art Museum to the Third Ward of Milwaukee which has just I don't know why people are so upset about Lake Park there is a three block stretch three city blocks so not that big and each there's 12 stops for 812 poor stops per block you can hit that you can walk that whole thing in five six minutes and then turn around and go back up it that what who cares about Lake Park guys I am mad about Lake Park because I don't want the man telling me what I can and can't do and when I can and can't do it so that's true the man can go take his laws and put them where they belong which is not on my body thank you that's true I agree with that but even if Lake Park was still as active and had seven more stops I feel like the Third Ward is really the place to go I love the biking so much because also biking counts for hatching your eggs because you're not going terribly fast well plus you can hatch eggs on a bike in the game so it would be arable if you couldn't yeah you're right well the story bikes are good and fun yeah I like them all I went back the second night and did it again and did six miles on the bike and my legs felt like noodles and all I want to do now is go back at night and bike and play pokemon go it's a real great feeling unfortunately I can't do that cuz I don't have the Apple watch but yeah Pokemon go plus then you would need the app just open in your basket as I mentioned before I do not approve of operating both a smart device and a bye at the same time you don't have to operate it though you just have to have the app open and then put it in your bike best I got you're just you're just talking about to hatch yes yes yeah well also there's a big difference when you're you know riding a bike around downtown Grand Rapids at one o'clock in the morning versus you know evening when people are in cars that's true around inside yeah one of the benefits at 10:01 was in Grand Rapids what one of the reasons why I like the night riding is because there's not that many cars are you a night writer you better believe it and there it's also way cooler new co-hosts I'm super effective kid the sun's not out it's not beating down on your neck well and also you're a vampire yeah that mean though that that's all true ah let's do one more email and then we'll jump over to Pokemon the week hear this message from luke from memphis tennessee deer spj and friends i love the latest episode where you just where you and your discussion about the latest amazing game Magikarp jump when I first started I saved up 600 gems to get Charizard he is amazing but then I listened to the episode to find out what things to buy I am now on my way to getting the whimsicott cushion I love the encounters you get in the game and I always scold Magikarp because you can regain all three training points I agree that's the that's the right thing to do I love it when you see a pokeball and you snag it and it says carp DM throw caution to the wind or something like that it's pretty hilarious and it refuses to jump for the berry it says better safe than sushi I really love this jump there's some good puns i still play pokemon go i have a few questions if you could lead an army of pokemon not Legendary's what would it be i would lead a bunch of toka kiss because Togekiss is my favorite pokemon what pokemon would you choose to be your guardian to protect you from all harm I would choose aegislash keep up the amazing work sincerely Luke can I would have an army of durant because they work well together in big things for me good answer yes that's a really thoughtful answer uh-oh Combee alright alright I'm just I'm just stealing wills answer basically like that I'll do something I'll say like good cuz they already see their D seem like they're soldiers so it's like they're already trained for it hmm I see what you say I'll have to come back on that one ah guardian pokemon to protect you oh I would do like I feel like I should do one where I could like go I could like trying to think if there's a pokemon that has like an orb in its body I can just go in so I'm like completely protected reunify thanks yeah I should just I should just happen to one of the little reunit list jellies and then I'm completely safe and I can bounce around and have a good time but you can't breathe in there I would say no I would say medicham that's a good interested what's your reasoning there they could put up barrier protect light screen it's true well if you want that then I'm picking Wobbuffet Wobbuffet just an expert in all that stuff it doesn't have the screens does it no I mean but it absorbs the damage and then that the air it deals yeah hard it so if I'm doing dual screens I got it you then you got to do something like klefki because it's got prankster and that's better klefki would be the less space in your house I feel like Wobbuffet would give it it's really cute yeah I want to talk about Magikarp splash just or Matt sorry magic carpet jump just a little bit Travis yours you're still playing are you gonna continue playing much to my own chagrin I will continue playing like there's no burnout for you there is I hate it I hate that I'm playing it right now as we speak I just I'm just the type of person where if there's a button to be pressed that gives me a thing it pains me if I'm not actively pressing it it's a terrible thing with how my brain works and I can't stop it and it won't stop until somehow I forget that it exists I mean it gives your finger something to do right I mean there are other mobile games that do that though yeah but not ones that have likes Pokemon yeah and you're not playing Pokemon go I'm playing a tiny bit of Pokemon okay cuz I mean you instead of opening magic carpet jump and I'm not saying you should or not I'm just giving a hypothetical you could open Pokemon go catch one or two Pokemon and then close it that's true I'm still playing Magikarp jump I'm still liking it I have felt a little bit of burnout so taking like two days off or like a day and a half I don't remember exactly was it was nice I would say most the burnout isn't from the game itself it's from these training / gym cutscenes yeah I have never been more frustrated to get though words of wisdom cut screen cuts the cutscene yeah that does nothing for you it does nothing and I looked it up it's a funny joke the first time it happens it's really funny the first time and now it's it's it's it's wasting my time yeah it is nothing but wasting six seconds of my life and it's mr. Resetti but you didn't do anything wrong but mr. Resetti is punishing you for turning off your game Zack that's exactly what I'm saying it's mr. Resetti if you didn't have to do anything wrong to make mr. Resetti show oh yeah yeah like why is that not a one-time joke why continue to tell me that nothing is happening it's so frustrating the other not this isn't frustrating but you know the one where you see the fruit in the water mm-hmm I think it's called the the old rod or the good rod yeah it's called old rod I think there's no bad punishment for that you can lose JP but you don't lose your magic yeah you don't die yeah which was the big worry there I still continue I cannot not open Voltorb I won't do that one if I've got a Pokemon earth a Pokemon if I've got a magic harp of a color where I still have patterns that I need like if I've got a magic harp that's small so it hasn't yet gotten big enough to where I see the full detail of its patterns and it's of a color for which I do not have all of the patterns I won't take it otherwise I will we talked last week about how I hadn't like ever seen it go well for me all of my bad luck must have been front-loaded because I've hardly ever had it explode on me since and the same thing with the pidgeotto one it's so it's been I've had a lot better luck with it lately and since we talked I had really good luck with the Voltorb and then I got I got five to six explosions in a row and then I'm back to the back to the good one did you get to the spoiler there's like a gray Magikarp are you there yet yep okay cuz I'm not that's cuz when you said like you won't take it when you have a pattern you don't already have I have all the current patterns correct right but I know when you beat a certain league at unlocks to new pattern or to new base patterns yeah to new colors yeah each of which has three I think yes patterns within it yes we got some corrections on this but because we said I said I said we didn't look up anything clique last week I think we both didn't know what Charizard it'd do you click on the get button it does tell you yeah it doesn't think that clear though so the reason I didn't click on it is because I had I know how much is popular I think 500 yeah so I had like 300 and some gems so I didn't want to click on slowpoke because I didn't want to accidentally by slowpoke so that's why I didn't know what's and it's also weird because that's not how the other shops and the game work like if you're buying a decoration it has a description with the lower Asian dunce under it yeah but that's not the case for the support Pokemon which is very a very strange choice yeah it's very odd papa leo he's in the water with you that's still frustrating for me like popular was real cute he's my boy I want him out of my way he's every 7 hours though not that big of a deal I think that's really able to say unless you have anything else I made it to level my life while we were recording congratulations why thank you on that slow road to level 46 like you guys yeah 50 once you know it's all about perseverance character and integrity I wish there was a way to auto battle like just take me through the league I get it especially where I am cuz I guess do you mind if I spoil what happens after the luxury league you go through a new league that just you can repeat over and over right right so it's like I'm just seeing the same things over it's not even like I mean not that I wasn't seeing the same things over and over again before but now I really am and I still have to watch it so it's boring to watch the leagues I mean I still like it don't get me wrong I just I feel like we said everything that's good about it and now all that's left is the slowness that exists in the game which I can't help thinking about because the that the slowness of how everything moves whether that's battles or the wasting your time with the words of wisdom like those take up so much more time than the actual fun part of the game that I can't yet hope but just consistently think about it there's like a times girl moles heartedly if the game was like hey we'll speed up everything 50% if you pay $10 I would throw so much money you had it because I just don't don't say that now they are gonna know if they were working on some sort of fast-forward now they are going to charge us for it well like even I thought about like giving more money in cuz right when you when you pay it accelerates the game right but yours but it doesn't accelerate the part of the game that is bad huh like I don't mind eating I don't mind spending my coins I don't mind the training sessions it's just yeah it's just beating a dead horse at this point that poor horse Magikarp jump then stores now digital stores Travis hmm give me give me the Pokemon of the week the Pokemon of the week for this week is a Pokemon that I really like but often forget about but when I'm reminded of it I remember that I liked it and that it is cool that is the Pokemon heliolisk has an interesting typing this one it is normal electric dry skin is an ability where if you are in our sunlight you're gonna lose an eighth of your HP at the end of each turn if you are in rain you gain an eighth of your ability each turn then in addition if you're hit by a water type move you gain a quarter of your HP back and you're immune to that moves effects you gain a weakness minor weakness to fire type attacks it'll deal 25% more damage and then yeah that's it so a lot of weird effects but essentially the most important ones for our purposes are that gain HP when you're hit by a water move and gain HP and rain because I'm picking this set from Daniel and our Pokemon of the week slack channel because it seems to be the set that has the most sort of input from everyone in the channel it seems to be the sort of culmination of everyone's inputs for heliolisk worth noting heliolisk is legal in the tiny Cup tournament so I've asked folks to pick not only moves up for he needs me panic oh yeah tiny tourney but also pick Pokemon paired it with Pokemon that could also be allowed in the tiny tourney so that's what people have done so this move set from Daniel is heliolisk with choice specs that increases the effectiveness of special attacking moves but locks you in to whatever you choose as your first choice to of a move when you send the Pokemon in if you switch it out and back in you can choose a different move however the V's are going to be 156 and HP 252 in special attack and 100 and speed with a modest nature so we are really maxing out the special attack output of heliolisk and then for the move set you're gonna do hyper voice because you are part normal type as I mentioned so that gives you same type attack bonus thunder because you might be pairing this with something that can set up rain because as I mentioned you've got dry skin so you're healing in the rain and then thunder has percent accuracy in the rain that can deal a lot of damage focus blast is there for coverage especially because you're weak to artists re you're not weak but like hyper voice wouldn't be able to hit steel types or or rock types and electrics not gonna be super effective so focus blast covers a lot of that for you and then lastly you're gonna use surf because you can have that boosted by the rain so it's almost like it gets a same type attack bonus even though you're not water type and then this is where the sort of partner Pokemon come in because you can partner at first with either something with drizzle which I'm not sure exists in the tiny tournament roster I don't think there is one but you can but folks in the slack channel recommend klefki with prankster so that you can use rain dance with increased priority thus boosting the damage output of surf but even better you can pair your heliolisk with you know at maybe after rain is set up you can pair it with a Vaporeon which believe it or not is short enough to be played in tiny tourney and you know the Eevee evolutions have some of the highest base stat total zuv any pokemon you can even use in that format and Vaporeon can have water absorb so you're using surf healing your Vaporeon hitting both of your opponents and it's boosted by the rain and you're being healed by the rain so it's just an all-around great situation your dance floor in the writing heliolisk to uh very one that to save everyone the time there are no pokemon that are small enough that have the drizzle ability thank you for that will because there are only three pokémon that have the drizzle ability and they're all over one meter tall thanks will some trivia here heliolisk is the only pokemon with the base stat total of 481 no other pokemon has the same type combination as heliolisk and it's pre evolutions he Louis is the only on grass type of pokémon to evolve with a Sunstone and Helios is the only Pokemon to have more than five Hangul characters in its Korean name I don't know if I said that word right Hangul yes that's close enough all right the generator Pokemon it's kind of cool like Helio I think from Jurassic Park it looks a lot like the thing from Jurassic Park yeah yeah not the Velociraptor but no no the thing that like attacks Newman in the Porta Potty Newman yeah and shoots the like weird acid at his face which apparently I wrote I'm dinosaur on which it's based can't actually do anything close to that I don't know that actor's name I just know him as Newman yeah I don't know it either ah you didn't say the magic word uh uh uh the

mention another thing that really bothers me about Magikarp jump and that's that if you upgrade the most common berry to the extent that it provides more JP than the berry that is then the berry that's one tier stronger than it it will actually start spawning more of that second tier berry because it gives you less I spent that coin hard-earned coin on that first berry because you give me so much of it so of course I'm gonna wanna upgrade that one so you can't swindle me like this Pokemon company and select button stop this just wanted to give a big shout-out to wall-e you can check him
