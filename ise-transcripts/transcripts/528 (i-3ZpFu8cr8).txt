dress up fancy and have people take your (2:24 - 2:28)
picture go someplace private and get (2:26 - 2:31)
that done get out of my way (2:28 - 2:35)
i don't want to see you (2:31 - 2:35)
uh perfect (2:36 - 2:39)
um (2:38 - 2:43)
well we have a pokemon show to do and i (2:39 - 2:45)
was not here last week (2:43 - 2:48)
um i was at the world championships so i (2:45 - 2:49)
guess i can talk about that experience a (2:48 - 2:52)
little bit and we have some pokemon news (2:49 - 2:54)
uh before we get to the world (2:52 - 2:56)
championship stuff just fresh on fresh (2:54 - 3:01)
on my mind uh go fest is officially over (2:56 - 3:02)
it's done (3:01 - 3:04)
we did all three interesting events when (3:02 - 3:06)
i say we (3:04 - 3:08)
as in the world (3:06 - 3:10)
yes (3:08 - 3:10)
uh there were the the three days there (3:10 - 3:15)
was the first two days back in june (3:12 - 3:17)
and then they did uh berlin in germany (3:15 - 3:20)
than they did uh seattle in the united (3:17 - 3:22)
states and then they (3:20 - 3:25)
finished the irl stuff in yokohama (3:22 - 3:27)
in japan wait i thought it was sapporo (3:25 - 3:29)
oh wait no (3:27 - 3:30)
was it (3:29 - 3:32)
where worlds is going yeah yeah yeah (3:30 - 3:33)
yeah i'm sorry (3:32 - 3:36)
they did go fest in yokohama like in (3:33 - 3:38)
2019. (3:36 - 3:41)
my i wish i was reading about earlier uh (3:38 - 3:42)
yes sapparo (3:41 - 3:45)
and then (3:42 - 3:45)
the last day was yesterday august 27th (3:45 - 3:50)
we did it (3:49 - 3:53)
uh it rained so you know we can't blame (3:50 - 3:55)
niantic for that we could (3:53 - 3:57)
do it i am like they had clearly have (3:55 - 4:00)
access to cast form and (3:57 - 4:02)
plenty of the sunny day moves and they (4:00 - 4:04)
used none of them so (4:02 - 4:06)
i mean hello (4:04 - 4:08)
i did think it was kind of strange that (4:06 - 4:10)
i got a bunch of kyogre stickers i don't (4:08 - 4:12)
know if you guys did but i got a bunch (4:10 - 4:15)
of kyogre sticks yeah (4:12 - 4:15)
release the groudon really historical (4:18 - 4:22)
they all have drought (4:20 - 4:24)
um (4:22 - 4:27)
rain aside (4:24 - 4:29)
uh (4:27 - 4:31)
i want to talk about (4:29 - 4:34)
whether or not this go fest felt like a (4:31 - 4:37)
go fest because i'm gonna say it didn't (4:34 - 4:38)
uh but it it didn't feel that way (4:37 - 4:39)
because of the rain or because of the (4:38 - 4:41)
location (4:39 - 4:43)
um and i i don't want to say that it (4:41 - 4:45)
felt that way because of the spawns (4:43 - 4:48)
because i thought that like (4:45 - 4:48)
i don't know i thought the spawns (4:48 - 4:52)
weren't awful but now i'm trying to (4:49 - 4:54)
remember our pros and cons from june and (4:52 - 4:57)
june felt like an eternity ago yeah (4:54 - 4:58)
because i think (4:57 - 5:00)
yeah the first day we played in the art (4:58 - 5:02)
park correct and then the second day we (5:00 - 5:04)
played at como (5:02 - 5:06)
which is a zoo (5:04 - 5:08)
um and i remember the second day being (5:06 - 5:09)
like (5:08 - 5:14)
why is there only niley go to raid yeah (5:09 - 5:14)
i my difficulty with it is i can't (5:16 - 5:23)
parse out if (5:20 - 5:23)
i'm just over it because i was oh i was (5:23 - 5:28)
like (5:26 - 5:31)
not enthused to do yet another (5:28 - 5:33)
go fest thing in the month of august (5:31 - 5:35)
like i was like i'm tired of community (5:33 - 5:39)
days at this point i'm tired of go fest (5:35 - 5:43)
i'm just tired i'm tired like (5:39 - 5:43)
daily incense while great also starts to (5:44 - 5:49)
itch at the i have to do this thing and (5:47 - 5:51)
you're eating up my time (5:49 - 5:53)
the 15 minutes yeah (5:51 - 5:55)
where i'm like (5:53 - 5:59)
i'm getting sort of burnt on (5:55 - 6:01)
go demanding my time and to know that it (5:59 - 6:03)
was eight hours and two hour chunks and (6:01 - 6:06)
they weren't repeating so i had to be (6:03 - 6:07)
there for (6:06 - 6:10)
at least six of the hours to see (6:07 - 6:12)
everything (6:10 - 6:12)
i i i would i i will admit i went to the (6:12 - 6:19)
day already feeling over it and the day (6:16 - 6:22)
did not turn me around on feeling over (6:19 - 6:25)
it i was just tired i'm just like this (6:22 - 6:25)
is (6:25 - 6:29)
it it felt like too much over the summer (6:25 - 6:31)
like it was just asking too much of me (6:29 - 6:33)
this by the time august rolled around (6:31 - 6:34)
and isn't there going to be like two (6:33 - 6:36)
events in september and i already don't (6:34 - 6:39)
want to do either (6:36 - 6:39)
oh i mean there's community day (6:39 - 6:43)
and isn't there a classic day is there a (6:42 - 6:45)
classic in september or was the classic (6:43 - 6:46)
for october (6:45 - 6:48)
but i think it's september i'm like i'm (6:46 - 6:50)
already tired just thinking about it i (6:48 - 6:52)
mean i i agree greg i think the the (6:50 - 6:54)
architecture of the whole thing is what (6:52 - 6:56)
killed it right if they had done (6:54 - 7:02)
the habitats three things in september (6:56 - 7:04)
the third the 11th and the 18th and i'm (7:02 - 7:07)
like i can't with you i can't (7:04 - 7:09)
i can't do this there are some people (7:07 - 7:12)
that only play this game and yeah (7:09 - 7:13)
those people would argue that there's (7:12 - 7:15)
not enough content yeah they're thrilled (7:13 - 7:16)
limited aspects of their life and i (7:15 - 7:19)
cannot assist you with that find other (7:16 - 7:21)
things to do (7:19 - 7:22)
i i think (7:21 - 7:26)
what will you were gonna say that like (7:22 - 7:27)
they have (7:26 - 7:31)
four two hour chunks instead of (7:27 - 7:32)
well they just should have wrote chunks (7:31 - 7:34)
done each habitat for an hour and then (7:32 - 7:35)
rotated them like they've done in the (7:34 - 7:38)
past and then that way if you miss one (7:35 - 7:40)
it'll come back around (7:38 - 7:41)
yes (7:40 - 7:44)
because like um and and again i know (7:41 - 7:45)
this is like a a (7:44 - 7:48)
personal problem for us (7:45 - 7:50)
but we got rained out during buzzwole (7:48 - 7:52)
and (7:50 - 7:54)
i guess if if (7:52 - 7:56)
if i didn't have like a 2 000 computer (7:54 - 7:58)
on my back i probably would have just (7:56 - 7:59)
walked through the rain to my car but i (7:58 - 8:01)
was like i can't really leave the (7:59 - 8:04)
cariboo until the rain leaves (8:01 - 8:05)
but (8:04 - 8:07)
during the buzzwole hour i missed the (8:05 - 8:09)
metal because we the the caribou only (8:07 - 8:11)
had a gym it didn't even have a pokestop (8:09 - 8:13)
so i mean spawns were okay and the (8:11 - 8:15)
incense worked while you were sitting (8:13 - 8:18)
still but i don't know which one pokemon (8:15 - 8:19)
i was missing because by the time that (8:18 - 8:21)
buzzword was over i was like oh my gosh (8:19 - 8:22)
i didn't get it (8:21 - 8:25)
whereas at the past communities in june (8:22 - 8:29)
sorry go fest those rotated every hour (8:25 - 8:30)
and i think of like (8:29 - 8:33)
it's the same argument of you know why (8:30 - 8:36)
isn't community day longer (8:33 - 8:37)
what if you're working in the morning (8:36 - 8:38)
what if you're working in the afternoon (8:37 - 8:42)
what if you have to take your child to a (8:38 - 8:44)
baseball game from one to two (8:42 - 8:45)
like (8:44 - 8:48)
the repeatingness of the event (8:45 - 8:49)
made it so like (8:48 - 8:52)
i'm gonna grind out because i can i (8:49 - 8:53)
can't do the whole event but i'm gonna (8:52 - 8:54)
grind out the morning because my morning (8:53 - 8:56)
is free or like i miss the morning i'm (8:54 - 8:59)
going to grind out the afternoon or i'm (8:56 - 9:01)
going to use this hour of buzzwole to (8:59 - 9:03)
just get lunch and i will wait for (9:01 - 9:05)
buzzwell to come back around in the (9:03 - 9:07)
evening and that we literally did that (9:05 - 9:09)
that first go fest at the art park yeah (9:07 - 9:11)
where i don't even remember what hour it (9:09 - 9:12)
was it was like the ice hour (9:11 - 9:14)
and i was like oh all these pokemon are (9:12 - 9:16)
bad and it's lunchtime (9:14 - 9:18)
i'll just wait for the ice hour to (9:16 - 9:19)
repeat because like (9:18 - 9:21)
this is the best time to eat lunch i (9:19 - 9:23)
think what i noticed (9:21 - 9:26)
when we were doing it live is (9:23 - 9:28)
we were done within the first hour and (9:26 - 9:30)
the second hour of waiting for it to (9:28 - 9:33)
turn over felt like an eternity like (9:30 - 9:35)
you're just wandering around like let's (9:33 - 9:38)
go here let's wander over here i mean at (9:35 - 9:40)
that point i was barely looking at the (9:38 - 9:44)
game because i completed the challenge i (9:40 - 9:46)
had done the allotted raids that i was (9:44 - 9:47)
going to do (9:46 - 9:50)
i had (9:47 - 9:53)
willow out of guzzlord's mouth and put (9:50 - 9:54)
him in a new jacket (9:53 - 9:57)
i had done all the things and they did (9:54 - 9:59)
fix his face though like his face is (9:57 - 10:00)
different (9:59 - 10:01)
yeah because we had to do massive (10:00 - 10:03)
reconstruction after he was mauled by (10:01 - 10:05)
guzzlord are you not listening to the (10:03 - 10:08)
storyline i don't understand (10:05 - 10:10)
the thing is (10:08 - 10:11)
if it had (10:10 - 10:12)
also (10:11 - 10:14)
you had to wait (10:12 - 10:16)
for each (10:14 - 10:16)
reset for the storyline to continue (10:17 - 10:22)
oh man that was the worst because like (10:20 - 10:26)
the the second one was started incense (10:22 - 10:28)
and i was like but i started an incense (10:26 - 10:30)
when i started this this morning and now (10:28 - 10:32)
that's going for three hours there are (10:30 - 10:34)
some people that like you know before (10:32 - 10:36)
the event even starts they turn on eight (10:34 - 10:37)
incense (10:36 - 10:38)
to like (10:37 - 10:40)
start right like the whole day and then (10:38 - 10:41)
they (10:40 - 10:43)
they have to just tack on an extra room (10:41 - 10:45)
because the the quest line is like (10:43 - 10:48)
do an incense (10:45 - 10:48)
i think because (10:48 - 10:51)
i think what hurt it one was already (10:52 - 10:57)
feeling burnt out like i'll admit i'm (10:55 - 10:58)
sure people had a great time i was (10:57 - 11:00)
coming in slightly burnt out but also (10:58 - 11:02)
the fact that (11:00 - 11:06)
it it rotated it rotated on such a long (11:02 - 11:08)
schedule that every time we got to the (11:06 - 11:10)
second (11:08 - 11:12)
half of the two-hour slot i was like (11:10 - 11:15)
there's nothing that i want to do here (11:12 - 11:17)
and i'm just (11:15 - 11:19)
buying time (11:17 - 11:21)
to get the next quest line and the next (11:19 - 11:23)
set of things to do that i know i'm (11:21 - 11:26)
going to complete in an hour (11:23 - 11:28)
and then i'm waiting another hour for (11:26 - 11:30)
the next thing to happen (11:28 - 11:31)
yeah and (11:30 - 11:33)
the argument could be like oh at those (11:31 - 11:34)
times that's when you go take your break (11:33 - 11:36)
because you're done and we did and it (11:34 - 11:39)
still felt like (11:36 - 11:40)
i'm waiting and then you had the thing (11:39 - 11:43)
where you didn't complete your ocd medal (11:40 - 11:45)
and like it would never come back and (11:43 - 11:46)
that's all you could talk about for the (11:45 - 11:49)
rest of the day yeah it did it did bum (11:46 - 11:52)
me out because like (11:49 - 11:54)
every other go fest those events came (11:52 - 11:55)
back around (11:54 - 11:58)
and like and it and you know if you if (11:55 - 11:59)
you got nine if you (11:58 - 12:02)
it's actually i also found it to be more (11:59 - 12:05)
engaging or more exciting right because (12:02 - 12:07)
like i remember (12:05 - 12:09)
in june i i don't remember it was like (12:07 - 12:11)
the grass habitat or whatever and it was (12:09 - 12:13)
like i got nine out of ten and i was (12:11 - 12:16)
like oh i missed the the (12:13 - 12:19)
uh fomantis or whatever and then when it (12:16 - 12:21)
came back around it was like okay i (12:19 - 12:22)
don't care about anything else don't (12:21 - 12:23)
care about chinese don't care about (12:22 - 12:25)
raids i want that fo mantis that's my (12:23 - 12:27)
target as soon as the clock turns over (12:25 - 12:30)
and it made it exciting so to like be (12:27 - 12:34)
like oh i missed mine i missed electric (12:30 - 12:34)
why (12:35 - 12:37)
i guess i don't have that metal and that (12:36 - 12:41)
sucks going into the next hour like (12:37 - 12:41)
i i can't say (12:42 - 12:45)
it it's hard to pinpoint like again it's (12:47 - 12:51)
hard for me to pinpoint what made it not (12:49 - 12:54)
feel great and i think they're just (12:51 - 12:57)
overall there are minor annoyances on (12:54 - 12:59)
top of what felt to be like a long (12:57 - 13:00)
summer (12:59 - 13:02)
where i was just (13:00 - 13:06)
i just couldn't (13:02 - 13:06)
i couldn't get the enthusiasm (13:06 - 13:12)
for the second half and the second half (13:10 - 13:15)
strikes so much that i was just like (13:12 - 13:17)
okay i could just go home like i'm just (13:15 - 13:18)
tired (13:17 - 13:20)
and yeah and then when you got to the (13:18 - 13:22)
last hour and it was like oh we're just (13:20 - 13:24)
going to mash everything in (13:22 - 13:26)
and it was still like (13:24 - 13:28)
do i have to keep doing this (13:26 - 13:30)
well again it's like weird because like (13:28 - 13:32)
it the whole event if you were a (13:30 - 13:36)
completionist or if you wanted to like (13:32 - 13:37)
pl (13:36 - 13:39)
like do everything right even even if (13:37 - 13:41)
you just wanted to do the storyline (13:39 - 13:43)
stuff you literally had to be out for (13:41 - 13:47)
six hours minimum yeah (13:43 - 13:48)
whereas (13:47 - 13:50)
whereas i know plenty of people (13:48 - 13:52)
and they prob they probably don't listen (13:50 - 13:52)
to the show because we got a lot of (13:52 - 13:54)
hardcore people that listen to the show (13:52 - 13:56)
but like when when (13:54 - 13:59)
irene did go fest or (13:56 - 14:00)
uh our (13:59 - 14:03)
our friend alex did go fest and they (14:00 - 14:04)
they rarely do these events but they do (14:03 - 14:05)
the events because they're like looking (14:04 - 14:06)
for something to do and they're like for (14:05 - 14:08)
10 bucks you guys are doing this i'll do (14:06 - 14:11)
it like cool i'll play pokemon go once a (14:08 - 14:13)
month or once every (14:11 - 14:15)
once every weekend (14:13 - 14:18)
they'll only in my experience do the (14:15 - 14:20)
four hours they're like i've experienced (14:18 - 14:23)
every habitat i did what i needed to do (14:20 - 14:25)
i finished the thing i'm going home now (14:23 - 14:27)
and that's fine like they got their (14:25 - 14:29)
money's worth and then there's like the (14:27 - 14:30)
hardcore people that want to do the (14:29 - 14:33)
whole thing which is which is mostly us (14:30 - 14:35)
um (14:33 - 14:35)
but like if if you finish the event (14:35 - 14:41)
in the like like after i realized that (14:38 - 14:44)
miss buzzwell and it was um the electric (14:41 - 14:46)
hour or whatever because uh circuitry (14:44 - 14:48)
was in raids you jumped into circuitry (14:46 - 14:50)
greg and i was like i i don't want to (14:48 - 14:51)
miss the collection challenge again so (14:50 - 14:52)
i'm just going to focus on collection (14:51 - 14:53)
challenge (14:52 - 14:54)
literally did the whole collection (14:53 - 14:57)
challenge in 10 minutes and then i (14:54 - 14:59)
started doing circuitry and then i (14:57 - 15:01)
finished the quest line which was like (14:59 - 15:02)
team rocket stuff (15:01 - 15:04)
finished that all in 30 minutes (15:02 - 15:06)
yeah and it's like (15:04 - 15:08)
there's really nothing else for me to do (15:06 - 15:10)
unless i want to grind xp on circuitry (15:08 - 15:13)
which i guess is like fine it would be (15:10 - 15:14)
nest if they were shiny so i can do two (15:13 - 15:16)
things at once but you know they're not (15:14 - 15:18)
or shiny check so i think about the (15:16 - 15:21)
players that are not the like i want a (15:18 - 15:25)
million chinese i want a million xp like (15:21 - 15:27)
they're just kind of like walking around (15:25 - 15:28)
because they have to wait for the next (15:27 - 15:30)
story to kick in after like another 90 (15:28 - 15:32)
minutes (15:30 - 15:34)
like honestly this is this was easily (15:32 - 15:37)
the worst go fest and we said we said (15:34 - 15:39)
like two months ago the like only nigh (15:37 - 15:42)
lego all day was the worst go fest but (15:39 - 15:43)
like (15:42 - 15:45)
i feel like they learned so much from (15:43 - 15:47)
the three in-person events (15:45 - 15:49)
and like the city experience the habitat (15:47 - 15:51)
experience and giving an hour break and (15:49 - 15:53)
having the rotations and then this one (15:51 - 15:55)
just felt like (15:53 - 15:58)
they planned it six months ago (15:55 - 15:59)
and they didn't take anything they (15:58 - 16:01)
learned and they were like oh yeah we (15:59 - 16:02)
forgot to we forgot we could have made (16:01 - 16:04)
this like slightly better (16:02 - 16:06)
oh well (16:04 - 16:08)
oh yeah it was on the books yeah on the (16:06 - 16:10)
books we're not looking back (16:08 - 16:12)
no let me look forward never look back (16:10 - 16:13)
but i don't think any of the none of the (16:12 - 16:14)
complaints had to do with the shiny (16:13 - 16:17)
rates the shiny rates felt fine like (16:14 - 16:20)
my issue was the pokemon selection felt (16:17 - 16:23)
good the bonuses felt great most of my (16:20 - 16:24)
shinies were things that i had already (16:23 - 16:26)
gotten from community today (16:24 - 16:29)
so it's just like oh i got another (16:26 - 16:31)
community day shiny yeah i needed those (16:29 - 16:35)
shiny machops and geodudes yep thanks we (16:31 - 16:38)
like the so again (16:35 - 16:38)
i think part of i get part of the (16:39 - 16:44)
problem is for me having done all these (16:41 - 16:46)
and having done all the community days (16:44 - 16:49)
the selection felt (16:46 - 16:49)
meh (16:49 - 16:52)
and when i got a shiny that i had that i (16:49 - 16:54)
had literally gotten 10 from a community (16:52 - 16:56)
today this very year it was also like (16:54 - 16:59)
okay cool i got another one of those (16:56 - 17:00)
um (16:59 - 17:01)
and it's not so much that the shiny rate (17:00 - 17:06)
felt off i just feel that (17:01 - 17:06)
there's usually (17:06 - 17:10)
i think like the selection across a lot (17:08 - 17:12)
of the go fest i think i said this (17:10 - 17:14)
before feel like it's a lot of things (17:12 - 17:17)
that have always already been there (17:14 - 17:21)
and here's a couple extras (17:17 - 17:23)
and the extras aren't that exciting (17:21 - 17:24)
this is what i was trying to explain (17:23 - 17:26)
though (17:24 - 17:28)
in june when we had the first two days (17:26 - 17:30)
of go fest because the the narrative (17:28 - 17:32)
around that go fest (17:30 - 17:35)
was they nerfed the shiny raid (17:32 - 17:37)
and i talked to niantic twice and other (17:35 - 17:40)
outlets also talked to niantic i wasn't (17:37 - 17:42)
the only one reporting this (17:40 - 17:44)
and niantic said the shiny rates for the (17:42 - 17:47)
2022 go fest (17:44 - 17:48)
worldwide go fest was exactly the same (17:47 - 17:52)
as the 2021 go fest and then there are (17:48 - 17:53)
there were some people out there that (17:52 - 17:55)
was like well i got 30 shinies last year (17:53 - 17:57)
and i only got 14 this year it was (17:55 - 17:59)
clearly nerfed it's like well no that's (17:57 - 18:03)
not exactly how rng worked no and then (17:59 - 18:05)
bobby and i went through (18:03 - 18:07)
uh with the help of like the self self (18:05 - 18:09)
road and other outlets (18:07 - 18:12)
showing that there were (18:09 - 18:16)
less things that could be shiny (18:12 - 18:17)
so (18:16 - 18:19)
so earlier in (18:17 - 18:22)
june they had the alolan starters and (18:19 - 18:23)
you you couldn't tap on those to be (18:22 - 18:25)
shiny right and then the other problem (18:23 - 18:27)
they had was there was mud kips and (18:25 - 18:28)
there was fields and there was swine (18:27 - 18:31)
nubs and those all had community days (18:28 - 18:33)
so (18:31 - 18:33)
i i don't doubt for a minute that they (18:34 - 18:38)
were exactly the same (18:36 - 18:40)
but when you fill the pool up with (18:38 - 18:42)
pokemon that can't be shiny or pokemon (18:40 - 18:44)
that you're probably not going to tap i (18:42 - 18:46)
don't i normally don't i don't think i (18:44 - 18:48)
tapped a single turrt wig let yesterday (18:46 - 18:51)
because like i have enough tart wig and (18:48 - 18:52)
i just (18:51 - 18:54)
don't need the candy i don't need to (18:52 - 18:55)
check if it's shiny if it's shiny cool (18:54 - 18:58)
but like i'm going to tap on other stuff (18:55 - 18:59)
um (18:58 - 19:02)
this time yesterday (18:59 - 19:04)
everything in the pool (19:02 - 19:07)
for so here fairmosa from 10 to 12 (19:04 - 19:10)
pikachu scyther pincer pseudo hitmontop (19:07 - 19:11)
meditate anarath krikatat wubat (19:10 - 19:14)
careblast everything that two hours (19:11 - 19:17)
could be shiny that's a huge difference (19:14 - 19:20)
yeah from yeah uh the june community day (19:17 - 19:22)
where i think (19:20 - 19:24)
only about like 60 percent of the (19:22 - 19:27)
pokemon in the hour could be shiny (19:24 - 19:29)
and then the the next one buzzwole (19:27 - 19:31)
pikachu machop geodude hitmollie (19:29 - 19:34)
hitmonchan megamar newmal craniados axe (19:31 - 19:36)
you dribbler the only i know i said axe (19:34 - 19:38)
you funny the only thing in that list (19:36 - 19:40)
that couldn't be shiny is drill bird (19:38 - 19:43)
so again almost everything and that that (19:40 - 19:45)
was that was the theme for (19:43 - 19:49)
all of yesterday so i i don't think (19:45 - 19:51)
the problem was like (19:49 - 19:54)
shiny rates or what could or could not (19:51 - 19:56)
be shiny but this is but there is going (19:54 - 20:00)
to be a problem going forward because (19:56 - 20:02)
we're almost done with the pokedex we're (20:00 - 20:05)
almost done like alola's almost done (20:02 - 20:07)
galler's pokedex is pretty small like (20:05 - 20:09)
they're going to continue turning on (20:07 - 20:11)
chinese (20:09 - 20:13)
so like (20:11 - 20:14)
the the (20:13 - 20:17)
the discussion around (20:14 - 20:18)
well (20:17 - 20:19)
there was (20:18 - 20:21)
a lot of repeat chinese or a lot of (20:19 - 20:24)
community chinese or a lot like (20:21 - 20:26)
there's only so many pokemon yeah once (20:24 - 20:27)
niantic turns them on they turn them on (20:26 - 20:29)
so like they have to do this weird (20:27 - 20:31)
mishmash of like well here's some (20:29 - 20:33)
community ones here are some rare ones (20:31 - 20:34)
here are some new ones but they're going (20:33 - 20:36)
to start running out of here the new (20:34 - 20:38)
ones yeah i mean are there any unknown (20:36 - 20:39)
letters left (20:38 - 20:41)
no evidence there are a lot that can be (20:39 - 20:44)
shiny yeah but i think the issue (20:41 - 20:47)
no all the letters are available okay (20:44 - 20:50)
niantic has been relying on (20:47 - 20:52)
that to generate excitement (20:50 - 20:54)
and now that that is (20:52 - 20:56)
waning (20:54 - 20:58)
they don't have a better idea to fill it (20:56 - 21:00)
in (20:58 - 21:00)
yet um new pikachus (21:01 - 21:05)
i think (21:13 - 21:16)
i mean like i think shinies are still (21:14 - 21:18)
fun to get they are i mean i i was happy (21:16 - 21:21)
with all the ones that i got but (21:18 - 21:23)
it is going to it is (21:21 - 21:25)
getting to the point of diminishing (21:23 - 21:27)
returns right like (21:25 - 21:29)
the excitement of (21:27 - 21:30)
my (21:29 - 21:31)
seeing i'm like oh cool i got another (21:30 - 21:34)
totodile and then it's like that is a (21:31 - 21:37)
shorter lived excitement because (21:34 - 21:40)
i had a total community day and i'm (21:37 - 21:42)
still happy that i got it but the hit (21:40 - 21:45)
isn't as big as to when i got the sand (21:42 - 21:48)
cloak burme which like whatever or the (21:45 - 21:50)
electric because i'm like oh i don't (21:48 - 21:52)
have those and i'm not tired of (21:50 - 21:55)
collecting them through this app (21:52 - 21:56)
and that's (21:55 - 22:02)
sort of the the problem that go has is (21:56 - 22:03)
it's always going to be exciting to get (22:02 - 22:05)
chinese like everybody likes getting (22:03 - 22:06)
them (22:05 - 22:07)
but (22:06 - 22:09)
you are starting to bump up against (22:07 - 22:13)
people's memories of those shinies being (22:09 - 22:15)
overwhelming in your app (22:13 - 22:18)
so me getting a shiny randomly in sword (22:15 - 22:20)
and shield is going to feel very (22:18 - 22:21)
different (22:20 - 22:24)
than getting a similar thing in go (22:21 - 22:28)
because go is becoming the shiny factory (22:24 - 22:30)
to some extent (22:28 - 22:32)
where you go get shinies and so they are (22:30 - 22:36)
beginning to run into people associating (22:32 - 22:38)
shiny and shiny collecting (22:36 - 22:41)
with their game (22:38 - 22:42)
and so that's going to start affecting (22:41 - 22:45)
people's perceptions of their tool of (22:42 - 22:48)
what the events are like and so (22:45 - 22:49)
you're going to have people complaining (22:48 - 22:52)
more that the core purpose of playing go (22:49 - 22:55)
which is at some point just becoming to (22:52 - 22:57)
collect shinies (22:55 - 23:00)
being off and i don't know how they are (22:57 - 23:02)
going to solve for that perception (23:00 - 23:04)
problem but i think we are beginning to (23:02 - 23:05)
feel it like (23:04 - 23:07)
yesterday was fun (23:05 - 23:09)
but also felt (23:07 - 23:11)
too long in a lot of ways sort of (23:09 - 23:14)
exhausting and multiple times we all (23:11 - 23:15)
kind of said (23:14 - 23:17)
the selection of pokemon here ain't (23:15 - 23:20)
great we're not wowed by a lot of what (23:17 - 23:23)
we're seeing just it doesn't feel great (23:20 - 23:26)
so now we need tpci to implement higher (23:23 - 23:29)
shine interest rates sh (23:26 - 23:31)
interest rates too (23:29 - 23:36)
to fight inflation shy inflation (23:31 - 23:36)
yeah i i i had fun i don't think it i (23:41 - 23:47)
don't think it was a very strong ending (23:44 - 23:49)
and i the other thing i wanted to (23:47 - 23:51)
mention before i move on is (23:49 - 23:53)
to me it didn't really feel like a go (23:51 - 23:55)
fest (23:53 - 23:55)
because like (23:55 - 23:59)
i felt like there was like no build up (23:57 - 24:00)
to it and i don't know if that was me (23:59 - 24:02)
because i was like traveling and i was i (24:00 - 24:04)
was like preparing for london i was in (24:02 - 24:07)
london i came back i had like (24:04 - 24:09)
i haven't even unpacked my suitcases and (24:07 - 24:11)
then i'm setting up for this stream but (24:09 - 24:13)
they kind of i felt like they made a big (24:11 - 24:14)
deal for the first two and they made a (24:13 - 24:16)
big deal going into each of the live (24:14 - 24:18)
ones and this one was like yeah it's (24:16 - 24:22)
coming this week i i i think (24:18 - 24:25)
the other three being destinations and (24:22 - 24:28)
being very overwhelming and very like (24:25 - 24:31)
these are huge go-to things (24:28 - 24:33)
that (24:31 - 24:35)
this one felt (24:33 - 24:37)
just like oh it's just (24:35 - 24:39)
it's just in your (24:37 - 24:41)
oh it's just here (24:39 - 24:43)
i just need to go do this and i i i (24:41 - 24:46)
think it's i think it it just suffers (24:43 - 24:47)
from being (24:46 - 24:48)
the last (24:47 - 24:50)
piece after (24:48 - 24:53)
three very big highly (24:50 - 24:56)
produced highly (24:53 - 24:59)
advertised destination locations right (24:56 - 25:02)
like there wasn't really anywhere to go (24:59 - 25:04)
and it also suffers from the final (25:02 - 25:07)
destination thing was worlds (25:04 - 25:09)
so like (25:07 - 25:11)
it was just (25:09 - 25:12)
oh i think (25:11 - 25:15)
run up to it was overwhelmed by (25:12 - 25:17)
everything else that's been happening (25:15 - 25:18)
this summer (25:17 - 25:20)
and so i don't think it had any chance (25:18 - 25:21)
of really (25:20 - 25:23)
finding its own light everywhere we went (25:21 - 25:25)
people were playing though (25:23 - 25:27)
right like we saw people playing at (25:25 - 25:30)
every location we went to (25:27 - 25:31)
yeah (25:30 - 25:34)
i mean yeah we did see people out about (25:31 - 25:36)
um (25:34 - 25:36)
i guess that can uh transition into (25:36 - 25:41)
there was a small go event at worlds (25:39 - 25:45)
uh where they had uh the pikachu in the (25:41 - 25:47)
the the london what is it called beep (25:45 - 25:50)
beep eater beefeater thing (25:47 - 25:52)
no it makes me mad they had another beef (25:50 - 25:55)
eater option (25:52 - 25:55)
yeah (25:56 - 25:58)
and it wasn't in raids there was no beef (25:57 - 26:00)
or rose road raids which i would have (25:58 - 26:02)
actually have given them probably fifty (26:00 - 26:05)
thousand dollars to remote into those (26:02 - 26:07)
all weekend like you have no idea how (26:05 - 26:08)
much money they would have actually made (26:07 - 26:09)
for me (26:08 - 26:12)
yeah they had a they had a (26:09 - 26:14)
in person like if you were there and you (26:12 - 26:17)
spun a stop you got like a quest line (26:14 - 26:19)
and then if you were watching the stream (26:17 - 26:20)
there was (26:19 - 26:22)
an ah a code that would last for an hour (26:20 - 26:24)
that would get you a quest line and they (26:22 - 26:26)
they repeated that like once every two (26:24 - 26:27)
hours and they were different codes but (26:26 - 26:29)
all the codes ultimately you couldn't (26:27 - 26:30)
like (26:29 - 26:32)
one code was enough (26:30 - 26:33)
not like if you redeemed four of them (26:32 - 26:34)
you would have got something else it (26:33 - 26:35)
just (26:34 - 26:37)
you got one quest line from it so that (26:35 - 26:38)
was like a (26:37 - 26:39)
i understood what they do that did that (26:38 - 26:41)
right like they wanted people to watch (26:39 - 26:43)
and then feel that like oh i finally got (26:41 - 26:45)
the code yeah (26:43 - 26:46)
um (26:45 - 26:49)
and then all the spawns around that were (26:46 - 26:50)
like (26:49 - 26:53)
for competitive stuff um so any anything (26:50 - 26:55)
that was doing really well competitively (26:53 - 26:57)
and go you could you could stock up on (26:55 - 26:58)
candy (26:57 - 26:59)
and (26:58 - 27:01)
and do that so (26:59 - 27:04)
i i don't think that's so much of a a go (27:01 - 27:05)
thing (27:04 - 27:07)
that i want to focus on is as much as a (27:05 - 27:10)
a thing to do at worlds (27:07 - 27:13)
and they've really like when i was (27:10 - 27:18)
streaming worlds or talking to people (27:13 - 27:18)
the the question came up like i don't (27:18 - 27:23)
really care about competitive (27:21 - 27:25)
is it worth it for me to come out to (27:23 - 27:26)
this event (27:25 - 27:28)
um (27:26 - 27:29)
and (27:28 - 27:31)
i i think this the simple answer for go (27:29 - 27:32)
players is it like if you like playing (27:31 - 27:35)
pokemon go then then yes because there (27:32 - 27:36)
are (27:35 - 27:37)
everything is lured up there's a bunch (27:36 - 27:40)
of gyms like obviously like niantic put (27:37 - 27:42)
a bunch of stops all over the place (27:40 - 27:44)
for that there was there was the (27:42 - 27:45)
exclusive t-shirt if you walked into the (27:44 - 27:47)
venue and you like swiped the the (27:45 - 27:49)
pokestop (27:47 - 27:50)
there was the exclusive field research (27:49 - 27:52)
to get like that pikachu (27:50 - 27:54)
um shiny (27:52 - 27:56)
um so i think (27:54 - 28:00)
worlds is doing a really good job at (27:56 - 28:03)
providing something for everyone (28:00 - 28:05)
and this was (28:03 - 28:08)
i don't know when they started to do (28:05 - 28:10)
that because i i went to the worlds in (28:08 - 28:12)
um it was either 2011 or 2012 it was the (28:10 - 28:15)
first one for black and white (28:12 - 28:18)
and that worlds had (28:15 - 28:19)
um (28:18 - 28:22)
a last chance qualifier for for both tcg (28:19 - 28:23)
and vgc and that that was all they had (28:22 - 28:25)
right like those were the only two games (28:23 - 28:26)
they had (28:25 - 28:29)
and it was that one was in san diego (28:26 - 28:31)
and that the the theme for that i (28:29 - 28:32)
remember was like pikachu on like a (28:31 - 28:34)
skateboard it was like graffiti style (28:32 - 28:36)
um black and white was still new there (28:34 - 28:38)
was a there was a (28:36 - 28:39)
scrafty (28:38 - 28:41)
that you could get a scraggy that you (28:39 - 28:45)
could get from the the download code (28:41 - 28:46)
and (28:45 - 28:48)
um the pokemon center was probably in a (28:46 - 28:51)
room the size of this office i'm sitting (28:48 - 28:51)
in (28:51 - 28:55)
and it's sold out the first day (28:51 - 28:57)
before 10 am (28:55 - 28:59)
because it because the whole event was (28:57 - 29:01)
in a hotel and the pokemon center was in (28:59 - 29:03)
this very tiny room (29:01 - 29:04)
people in the hotel just didn't go to (29:03 - 29:06)
sleep they just walked down four floors (29:04 - 29:09)
and sat in front of the the (29:06 - 29:12)
hotel room door and then waited for it (29:09 - 29:13)
to open and then they they bought (29:12 - 29:14)
everything (29:13 - 29:15)
so (29:14 - 29:18)
that entire event there was no pokemon (29:15 - 29:20)
center for me because i woke up at 10 i (29:18 - 29:22)
walked downstairs and there was like (29:20 - 29:24)
sorry sold out closed like we're not (29:22 - 29:26)
stalking anything like it is done for (29:24 - 29:27)
the weekend we (29:26 - 29:29)
messed up (29:27 - 29:30)
um (29:29 - 29:32)
and then i didn't go to a (29:30 - 29:35)
a worlds for a couple years then i ended (29:32 - 29:38)
up going to the nashville one (29:35 - 29:40)
um and that one started that one had (29:38 - 29:42)
like a pretty (29:40 - 29:43)
pretty huge pokemon center honestly and (29:42 - 29:45)
it had stuff all weekend (29:43 - 29:47)
um and that venue was really great that (29:45 - 29:48)
was where you could play let's go (29:47 - 29:50)
pikachu let's go eevee early (29:48 - 29:54)
uh they had unknown spawns (29:50 - 29:55)
gosh i don't even remember who was in (29:54 - 29:57)
raids at that time (29:55 - 29:59)
um (29:57 - 29:59)
but they had ra they had pokemon go (29:59 - 30:03)
specific stops and then after that was (30:02 - 30:04)
dc (30:03 - 30:06)
and dc had like the special aerodactyl (30:04 - 30:09)
relicanth research so they've definitely (30:06 - 30:12)
made these events more and more (30:09 - 30:14)
what's the word inclusive (30:12 - 30:16)
um yeah (30:14 - 30:17)
but (30:16 - 30:19)
in london not only did they have the (30:17 - 30:20)
pokemon go stuff (30:19 - 30:21)
um (30:20 - 30:24)
they had like a learn to play tcg area (30:21 - 30:25)
which i talked about that like the (30:24 - 30:28)
seattle gofest had they had a huge room (30:25 - 30:29)
for that so you could learn to play the (30:28 - 30:32)
tcg they had the movie debut for the (30:29 - 30:36)
arceus movie which i think um (30:32 - 30:36)
didn't dc have like a detective pikachu (30:36 - 30:39)
showing or something it was like a (30:38 - 30:40)
little bit different they had a little (30:39 - 30:44)
computer theater yeah in the back (30:40 - 30:45)
um (30:44 - 30:47)
so they had the movie showing they had (30:45 - 30:48)
they had what was called the world (30:47 - 30:51)
square which was free to anyone you (30:48 - 30:53)
didn't have to have a ticket a spectator (30:51 - 30:55)
pass at all you just had to get in line (30:53 - 30:57)
but in there you get like a free bandana (30:55 - 30:59)
pictures with pikachu and eevee free (30:57 - 31:01)
boba free cookie (30:59 - 31:02)
um (31:01 - 31:04)
there's like a coloring station (31:02 - 31:05)
um (31:04 - 31:07)
there was like a lot of things to do and (31:05 - 31:09)
that was again completely for free oh (31:07 - 31:12)
they gave you like a free tumbler like a (31:09 - 31:15)
water jug cup bottle water bottle that's (31:12 - 31:16)
the word water bottle they give you a (31:15 - 31:18)
free water bottle (31:16 - 31:20)
so yeah a bunch of free stuff there um (31:18 - 31:21)
the pokemon center was the biggest it's (31:20 - 31:23)
ever been although a lot of the the (31:21 - 31:26)
items that (31:23 - 31:30)
the they they did a really poor job (31:26 - 31:33)
um also full disclosure uh the pokemon (31:30 - 31:36)
company paid for my hotel for london (31:33 - 31:37)
just (31:36 - 31:39)
there was money (31:37 - 31:40)
they paid for the hotel part of it (31:39 - 31:42)
um (31:40 - 31:44)
they did such a poor job at regulating (31:42 - 31:47)
the pokemon center so you did need an (31:44 - 31:49)
appointment ideally (31:47 - 31:51)
to get in although sometimes they were (31:49 - 31:53)
just letting random people in sometimes (31:51 - 31:54)
you could just they you could just line (31:53 - 31:55)
up and they would let you back in (31:54 - 31:57)
sometimes they would be like no you no (31:55 - 31:59)
no one lining up you need appointments (31:57 - 32:00)
so that was like there's no rhyme or (31:59 - 32:02)
reason for that i have no clue what they (32:00 - 32:05)
were doing but (32:02 - 32:06)
um (32:05 - 32:08)
some items had like (32:06 - 32:10)
they had four different dice boxes (32:08 - 32:12)
and the dice box was always kind of a (32:10 - 32:14)
big thing at worlds because there are (32:12 - 32:15)
these little metal dice they're for (32:14 - 32:16)
damage counters and then it comes with (32:15 - 32:17)
like a gx marker and then it comes with (32:16 - 32:18)
a coin (32:17 - 32:20)
and they had four of them this year and (32:18 - 32:23)
it was limit one (32:20 - 32:26)
just one not one of each just one so you (32:23 - 32:29)
pick you you pick one two three four (32:26 - 32:32)
and it was one per (32:29 - 32:32)
person so like irene got a separate bag (32:33 - 32:39)
just to get another one so we would have (32:37 - 32:41)
two of the four (32:39 - 32:42)
and (32:41 - 32:44)
then (32:42 - 32:46)
like the skateboards were like limit (32:44 - 32:48)
four i think (32:46 - 32:51)
um and then the the shirts had no limits (32:48 - 32:52)
the jackets had no limits i don't know (32:51 - 32:55)
if they had pins okay i know they had (32:52 - 32:57)
pins because the pokemon (32:55 - 32:59)
uh the pokemon company gave me a free (32:57 - 33:00)
pin set it was like part of my like (32:59 - 33:03)
welcome package in my hotel room but i (33:00 - 33:05)
went like down there to get more pins (33:03 - 33:06)
because there was a rose rate pin there (33:05 - 33:07)
was like a pikachu in the rosary pin and (33:06 - 33:10)
i was like oh i bet greg would want that (33:07 - 33:12)
they literally didn't exist (33:10 - 33:14)
um so i i don't know if there was a (33:12 - 33:16)
limit on them but if there was they were (33:14 - 33:18)
already gone and then we got to like the (33:16 - 33:19)
big wall of plushes where i had the (33:18 - 33:21)
pikachu plush and the roseride plush and (33:19 - 33:22)
they were like stacked to the ceiling (33:21 - 33:25)
and they said limit five and i was like (33:22 - 33:26)
that seems like a lot because you would (33:25 - 33:28)
see people walk up and put five of each (33:26 - 33:31)
in their bag and then leave (33:28 - 33:33)
um (33:31 - 33:35)
and then (33:33 - 33:35)
lo and behold the the rose raid plush (33:35 - 33:39)
and the pikachu plush were sold out like (33:37 - 33:42)
friday night they had a few on saturday (33:39 - 33:44)
morning but they had nothing on sunday (33:42 - 33:46)
and then on sunday the last day when i (33:44 - 33:49)
walked in it was unlimited for the dice (33:46 - 33:50)
boxes (33:49 - 33:51)
unlimited for the skateboards take as (33:50 - 33:54)
many as you want (33:51 - 33:54)
how much money is he selling the (33:54 - 33:57)
skateboards for (33:55 - 33:59)
they were 200 pounds (33:57 - 34:00)
yeah (33:59 - 34:03)
but no tax because it's built in (34:00 - 34:06)
but also the skateboards there didn't (34:03 - 34:08)
have wheels or trucks it was just the (34:06 - 34:09)
board (34:08 - 34:11)
well what are you going to do with the (34:09 - 34:12)
trucks they're not riding skateboards (34:11 - 34:14)
anyways (34:12 - 34:16)
yeah but if you're paying 250 in america (34:14 - 34:18)
you're getting wheels and trucks um (34:16 - 34:20)
i mean i could get a decent skateboard (34:18 - 34:22)
for less than 250 in america (34:20 - 34:25)
yeah (34:22 - 34:25)
i i think i think they should have been (34:25 - 34:29)
more conservative in the fact that like (34:26 - 34:31)
everything on friday and saturday should (34:29 - 34:33)
have been like limit two (34:31 - 34:34)
and then if they started to realize they (34:33 - 34:36)
had more stuff like they clearly made (34:34 - 34:38)
way too many dice because there's the (34:36 - 34:40)
when when you walk in and they're like (34:38 - 34:42)
one per person not one of each one per (34:40 - 34:43)
person and the last day they're just (34:42 - 34:45)
take as many as you want please we don't (34:43 - 34:47)
want to ship these back (34:45 - 34:50)
that's the gen con sunday yeah special (34:47 - 34:52)
it's gonna happen when they're like we (34:50 - 34:54)
don't want to pay to bring these back (34:52 - 34:56)
please buy our games jenkins do you want (34:54 - 34:58)
a free game (34:56 - 35:00)
with our game (34:58 - 35:02)
but i mean that also sucks for somebody (35:00 - 35:03)
who came out on saturday and they were (35:02 - 35:05)
like oh my gosh like (35:03 - 35:07)
i mean they had (35:05 - 35:10)
they had plenty of stuff they had a lot (35:07 - 35:12)
of stuff it was just like (35:10 - 35:15)
um there was like a switch case that was (35:12 - 35:17)
pretty much gone any pins were gone uh (35:15 - 35:19)
they had a messenger bag that was gone (35:17 - 35:20)
pretty fast the (35:19 - 35:23)
rose raid pikachu plush was gone really (35:20 - 35:24)
fast (35:23 - 35:26)
um (35:24 - 35:28)
if anybody wants to gift me that pin (35:26 - 35:29)
though (35:28 - 35:32)
i'll take it but it but like the the (35:29 - 35:33)
things i felt like (35:32 - 35:35)
if you could get it on pokemoncenter.com (35:33 - 35:37)
it was pretty much there all weekend (35:35 - 35:38)
which makes like sense because yeah that (35:37 - 35:40)
was that was my role walking in i'm not (35:38 - 35:43)
gonna buy anything that i could just (35:40 - 35:44)
go to the website and order and then it (35:43 - 35:46)
will be at my door by the time i get (35:44 - 35:47)
back from london (35:46 - 35:48)
and you don't have to figure out how (35:47 - 35:50)
you're getting at home (35:48 - 35:52)
yeah yeah i think i i toyed with the (35:50 - 35:55)
skateboard but it was like (35:52 - 35:58)
i i'd have to literally ship it (35:55 - 36:02)
and at that point like (35:58 - 36:03)
i'd have to get a box for it because (36:02 - 36:05)
like i don't want to ship it in the box (36:03 - 36:06)
that came in because then that i don't (36:05 - 36:08)
know (36:06 - 36:12)
i ain't fit in the luggage (36:08 - 36:12)
but yeah i i think they did a really (36:13 - 36:16)
good job at worlds to (36:14 - 36:19)
make it where (36:16 - 36:20)
if you lived i i would say if you live (36:19 - 36:22)
within two hours it was probably worth (36:20 - 36:23)
coming down for the day because you (36:22 - 36:25)
would be able to do the world fair you'd (36:23 - 36:27)
be able to play pogo you'd be able to (36:25 - 36:29)
watch battles you'd be able to meet (36:27 - 36:30)
people you'd be able to go to the (36:29 - 36:31)
pokemon center (36:30 - 36:33)
depending on what day (36:31 - 36:34)
because i think they only showed the (36:33 - 36:36)
movie one day (36:34 - 36:38)
um you'd be able to go to the tcg thing (36:36 - 36:40)
there was there's like other stuff you (36:38 - 36:41)
probably could have done that i like (36:40 - 36:44)
didn't do because i was like so busy but (36:41 - 36:47)
they they've done such a good job (36:44 - 36:50)
at making that feel like a pokemon (36:47 - 36:52)
convention versus (36:50 - 36:54)
um i'm going to there to compete and (36:52 - 36:58)
then i am going to leave when i am done (36:54 - 36:59)
uh yeah and there were side events too (36:58 - 37:01)
like you could play (36:59 - 37:04)
you could play in a in in tcg side (37:01 - 37:06)
events or unite side events or (37:04 - 37:07)
the video game side events (37:06 - 37:09)
um because my friend kid was there and (37:07 - 37:12)
he didn't qualify for worlds but (37:09 - 37:14)
he went like six in one in like a side (37:12 - 37:16)
event and i don't know i think they gave (37:14 - 37:17)
him like a booster box or something of (37:16 - 37:20)
cards for winning (37:17 - 37:21)
so (37:20 - 37:22)
yeah there are (37:21 - 37:24)
tons of things to do i think you guys (37:22 - 37:25)
talked about the announcement of it (37:24 - 37:27)
being in yokohama (37:25 - 37:30)
yep um (37:27 - 37:31)
last week and (37:30 - 37:34)
uh (37:31 - 37:34)
you know i would i would love to say (37:36 - 37:39)
like hey (37:37 - 37:42)
go on over enjoy it but like (37:39 - 37:45)
uh uh you know japan well (37:42 - 37:47)
ideally the borders would be open by (37:45 - 37:49)
then because i i did (37:47 - 37:52)
they are i it was in slack that like (37:49 - 37:53)
they're they're getting ready to like (37:52 - 37:56)
loosen it a little bit yeah i mean but (37:53 - 37:57)
it's still an expensive trip right it's (37:56 - 38:01)
an expensive trip also like don't i mean (37:57 - 38:05)
save for it but don't be surprised if (38:01 - 38:07)
next year they are like no we've got (38:05 - 38:09)
borders closed because (38:07 - 38:10)
they are (38:09 - 38:14)
politically in a unique situation and (38:10 - 38:15)
they are (38:14 - 38:17)
dealing with a unique covet situation (38:15 - 38:19)
right now and we have no idea what the (38:17 - 38:21)
world's gonna look like in a year so (38:19 - 38:23)
like block it off and maybe start saving (38:21 - 38:26)
money but also temper your expectations (38:23 - 38:28)
about this trip because they could (38:26 - 38:31)
easily close their borders again and say (38:28 - 38:33)
no we're just not letting anybody in (38:31 - 38:34)
yeah yeah you don't have to worry about (38:33 - 38:37)
like flights or hotels yeah anyways (38:34 - 38:38)
right now like the government's not (38:37 - 38:40)
going to listen to the pokemon company (38:38 - 38:41)
so (38:40 - 38:42)
like in the government's making (38:41 - 38:44)
decisions i mean some governments listen (38:42 - 38:46)
you know florida listens to disney (38:44 - 38:48)
pretty pretty well (38:46 - 38:50)
really excuse me have you not been (38:48 - 38:52)
paying attention to the news at all (38:50 - 38:54)
that one because they're trying to take (38:52 - 38:56)
a lot of things away from exactly (38:54 - 38:58)
against them so (38:56 - 39:00)
uh in a capitalistic society (38:58 - 39:03)
corporations have a bit more sway and (39:00 - 39:06)
japan is in a a unique situation right (39:03 - 39:10)
now but like here's my thing i am (39:06 - 39:13)
contemplating seriously going like i (39:10 - 39:15)
will i'm thinking about putting money (39:13 - 39:16)
aside i'm thinking about like i've got (39:15 - 39:19)
my passport i can make this (39:16 - 39:21)
trip happen but i'm also not counting on (39:19 - 39:22)
it because (39:21 - 39:24)
i don't know what's going to happen in a (39:22 - 39:27)
year (39:24 - 39:27)
yeah i mean like (39:29 - 39:32)
obviously it's funny because (39:32 - 39:37)
it's funny because uh um (39:35 - 39:40)
i i was on the silf road and they were (39:37 - 39:43)
the they they posted about the korea (39:40 - 39:44)
there's going to be a safari zone in (39:43 - 39:46)
south korea (39:44 - 39:48)
um like an hour south of seoul i can't (39:46 - 39:50)
remember the city name (39:48 - 39:51)
um (39:50 - 39:52)
but it (39:51 - 39:54)
like there there was a handful of (39:52 - 39:56)
comments of people being like i'm so (39:54 - 39:58)
sick of niantic doing like why can't all (39:56 - 40:00)
these events be worldwide (39:58 - 40:01)
and (40:00 - 40:03)
i'm i'm thinking to myself like have (40:01 - 40:05)
these people like never heard of like (40:03 - 40:09)
concerts or festivals or like (40:05 - 40:09)
like these like big events that you have (40:10 - 40:14)
to travel for right like (40:11 - 40:16)
like gamescom is exclusive to germany (40:14 - 40:19)
right like lollapalooza is exclusive to (40:16 - 40:21)
chicago well now it is (40:19 - 40:24)
wrestlemania is exclusive to whatever (40:21 - 40:26)
city they decide to pick right like like (40:24 - 40:29)
niantic did not invent the (40:26 - 40:32)
but event per city also and the cities (40:29 - 40:34)
get something from it right like the (40:32 - 40:36)
cities fight for these events because (40:34 - 40:38)
they want to bring in the tourism and so (40:36 - 40:39)
i'm like reading these comments and i'm (40:38 - 40:40)
like (40:39 - 40:43)
man why are people so salty about like (40:40 - 40:45)
these like in-person events because like (40:43 - 40:47)
yeah they could make them worldwide but (40:45 - 40:50)
there's there's still so much value for (40:47 - 40:51)
the city and for the company and for the (40:50 - 40:53)
people (40:51 - 40:56)
also fair to hate to be fair (40:53 - 40:59)
people also complain about things being (40:56 - 41:01)
locked in destination things people have (40:59 - 41:03)
complained about lollapalooza being (41:01 - 41:05)
where it is people complain about (41:03 - 41:07)
artists not coming to their city on (41:05 - 41:10)
tours this is not just a (41:07 - 41:12)
only happens (41:10 - 41:14)
to this people complain about things not (41:12 - 41:17)
coming to their cities all the time (41:14 - 41:19)
of all these other things you just don't (41:17 - 41:23)
care about it yes but also (41:19 - 41:25)
also if you're traveling to korea for (41:23 - 41:27)
pokemon go which is another complaint of (41:25 - 41:29)
like who would spend you know (41:27 - 41:31)
two thousand dollars to go play pokemon (41:29 - 41:33)
go in korea (41:31 - 41:35)
well (41:33 - 41:35)
you're going to do other things right (41:38 - 41:43)
like it is a vacation like like i i have (41:40 - 41:45)
a friend that goes to every wrestlemania (41:43 - 41:47)
and it costs (41:45 - 41:47)
2 (41:47 - 41:50)
dollars he doesn't go (41:47 - 41:52)
watch wrestling and come home he like (41:50 - 41:54)
goes and he explores the city and he has (41:52 - 41:55)
other things booked and like (41:54 - 41:57)
wrestlemania or these two days he does (41:55 - 41:59)
something before or something after (41:57 - 42:00)
meets up with like (41:59 - 42:02)
i think i think the people complaining (42:00 - 42:04)
maybe have just never gone on a vacation (42:02 - 42:06)
before i mean (42:04 - 42:08)
it's hard to vacation these days (42:06 - 42:12)
i've been on a vacation in four years (42:08 - 42:14)
yeah but like like if you were already (42:12 - 42:16)
thinking about going to japan (42:14 - 42:19)
and if you wanted to go to a worlds (42:16 - 42:22)
ideally now's your chance to try to pair (42:19 - 42:24)
those two together (42:22 - 42:26)
and be like well i was planning to go to (42:24 - 42:28)
japan for a week (42:26 - 42:30)
worlds is three to four days i'll get (42:28 - 42:32)
there a little early i'll explore (42:30 - 42:34)
yokohama or you i don't start in tokyo (42:32 - 42:36)
or something like i'll go in tokyo i'll (42:34 - 42:37)
be in tokyo for a couple days i'll go (42:36 - 42:40)
down to yokohama i'll be in yokohama for (42:37 - 42:42)
worlds after that i'll go to kyoto like (42:40 - 42:44)
you could you can make a trip out of it (42:42 - 42:46)
ideally um and you don't even have to go (42:44 - 42:47)
to worlds all four days if you're not (42:46 - 42:50)
competing like i think (42:47 - 42:52)
in the london experience (42:50 - 42:52)
um (42:52 - 42:54)
maybe uh (42:52 - 42:55)
two days of the four days would have (42:54 - 42:58)
been like you could do everything i (42:55 - 42:59)
don't realistically i don't think you (42:58 - 43:01)
could have done everything in london in (42:59 - 43:03)
a day but i think you get it all done in (43:01 - 43:05)
two days (43:03 - 43:07)
so (43:05 - 43:07)
exciting yes (43:07 - 43:12)
uh unknown you know it right now it's in (43:09 - 43:14)
a country that has their borders closed (43:12 - 43:16)
and they've been closed for a long time (43:14 - 43:20)
and there was already a pokemon event (43:16 - 43:22)
sapparo that (43:20 - 43:24)
a lot of people wanted to go to i had (43:22 - 43:27)
money set aside for it like and (43:24 - 43:30)
i couldn't go the borders were closed (43:27 - 43:31)
so (43:30 - 43:32)
i (43:31 - 43:34)
i guess my expectations are that right (43:32 - 43:36)
like i would love to go to (43:34 - 43:37)
worlds again (43:36 - 43:39)
i would love to go back to japan i (43:37 - 43:41)
thought sapporo was gonna be i thought i (43:39 - 43:42)
thought everything was gonna be fine by (43:41 - 43:45)
sapporo and it wasn't (43:42 - 43:48)
and that sucked but (43:45 - 43:48)
uh you know i think there will always be (43:48 - 43:52)
more pokemon events (43:50 - 43:53)
that is true (43:52 - 43:55)
yep (43:53 - 43:58)
all right uh let's take a break we have (43:55 - 44:00)
some more pokemon news there was a mini (43:58 - 44:02)
cooper there was a (44:00 - 44:05)
movie there's some (44:02 - 44:08)
lego masters excitement happening right (44:05 - 44:10)

yeah i am back (44:22 - 44:27)
from the break um (44:23 - 44:27)
some quick news here pokemon the movie (44:28 - 44:33)
secrets of the jungle comes to itunes (44:30 - 44:35)
google play and (44:33 - 44:38)
amazon um this movie was (44:35 - 44:41)
exclusively on netflix (44:38 - 44:43)
but now you can either purchase it or (44:41 - 44:46)
rent it digitally (44:43 - 44:46)
i thought that movie is pretty good (44:47 - 44:54)
i think it is decent it's enjoyable (44:51 - 44:56)
it has a heck of a twist at the end (44:54 - 45:00)
little little riff on tarzan there (44:56 - 45:00)
um there was an event (45:02 - 45:06)
in uh (45:05 - 45:09)
germany i believe it was (45:06 - 45:11)
um (45:09 - 45:11)
mini (45:12 - 45:15)
the the car company mini (45:13 - 45:16)

it's managed by bmw i'm not gonna make (45:19 - 45:26)
any hard stakes about ownership (45:22 - 45:26)

cooper (45:42 - 45:47)
um where they they they decked it out in (45:44 - 45:49)
in pokemon stuff and then they put it in (45:47 - 45:52)
a giant like (45:49 - 45:56)
toy packaging thing (45:52 - 45:58)
so they used a lot of plastic (45:56 - 45:59)
correct (45:58 - 46:02)
it's fantastic (45:59 - 46:03)
and (46:02 - 46:06)
that there there's like uh the pikachu (46:03 - 46:07)
decals on it yeah it was cool it's like (46:06 - 46:09)
kind of a hard to explain in the video (46:07 - 46:11)
um this is just a marketing gimmick (46:09 - 46:13)
they're not like selling this car no (46:11 - 46:15)
they are not (46:13 - 46:18)
but it was like oh yeah you know mini (46:15 - 46:20)

the purse is the purse is 700 is worth a (47:09 - 47:13)
bag (47:12 - 47:15)

new mega pokemon motion pikachu building (48:42 - 48:47)
set assemble this highly detailed model (48:45 - 48:51)
of the popular electric type pokemon (48:47 - 48:54)
however uh that's only half the fun turn (48:51 - 48:57)
the hand activated crank (48:54 - 48:59)
on the side of the model's base to see (48:57 - 49:01)
pikachu animate with an authentic (48:59 - 49:03)
running motion the pokemon's little legs (49:01 - 49:05)
and feet charge forward and its tail (49:03 - 49:07)
springs and its head bobs (49:05 - 49:10)
there are 1095 bricks (49:07 - 49:12)
and pieces in this set and the finished (49:10 - 49:15)
pikachu measures uh nine inches long (49:12 - 49:17)
it is a fun build (49:15 - 49:20)
it's the nature of (49:17 - 49:21)
the mechanics that provide a bit of a (49:20 - 49:22)
challenge the set is recommended for (49:21 - 49:25)
ages 12 and up so younger pokemon fans (49:22 - 49:28)
might need some help assembling it (49:25 - 49:31)
i got to keep track of 1094 (49:28 - 49:33)
pieces (49:31 - 49:33)
i don't know i don't know that's it's (49:33 - 49:38)
more than 10 yes it's a lot (49:35 - 49:40)
for like a lego looking thing (49:38 - 49:42)
i don't follow lego culture i don't know (49:40 - 49:45)
what's a lot what's not a lot (49:42 - 49:47)
like when you know what number culture (49:45 - 49:49)
is a thousand of anything is a lot (49:47 - 49:51)
that's exactly like yeah yeah like (49:49 - 49:52)
numbers are (49:51 - 49:54)
it's not like it's four pieces of head (49:52 - 49:56)
body and legs (49:54 - 49:59)
it's a thousand separate pieces yeah but (49:56 - 50:00)
you know how they have like the death (49:59 - 50:02)
star at like mall of america and it's (50:00 - 50:05)
like that's like a million pieces and i (50:02 - 50:07)
don't know how many pieces it is i just (50:05 - 50:09)
know it's like i just know it's like 800 (50:07 - 50:10)
or something for that and the problem (50:09 - 50:13)
with this one is if you get one of the (50:10 - 50:15)
mechanical pieces in the wrong place (50:13 - 50:17)
pikachu's got a limp (50:15 - 50:20)
it's true it's not going to run right (50:17 - 50:23)
very true oh and if anybody wonders why (50:20 - 50:25)
i said 1094 (50:23 - 50:28)
and not the full 1095. one of the pieces (50:25 - 50:30)
is a nameplate that can either say (50:28 - 50:32)
pikachu or have the japanese letters you (50:30 - 50:35)
pick so you can lose one of them and (50:32 - 50:36)
you're okay (50:35 - 50:39)

fly around and fight battles in the (50:57 - 51:00)
robot what is that song (50:59 - 51:02)
condoms (51:00 - 51:04)

three pieces how much is the death star (51:09 - 51:14)
well this one because it's discontinued (51:12 - 51:15)

um (51:18 - 51:24)
okay here is a 800 (51:20 - 51:24)
imperial star destroyer okay and it is 4 (51:25 - 51:33)
784 pieces no (51:30 - 51:35)
and how much was that (51:33 - 51:36)
uh (51:35 - 51:38)
after taxes everything it'd be close to (51:36 - 51:40)
eight hundred dollars okay so a thousand (51:38 - 51:44)

pikachu uh (53:39 - 53:43)
sickness suit red and pikachu thank you (53:41 - 53:46)
signature red and pikachu these are not (53:43 - 53:47)
bait these are the final three right (53:46 - 53:49)
these are not bait these are the final (53:47 - 53:50)
three (53:49 - 53:52)
ash is here (53:50 - 53:54)
i started my ash pulls (53:52 - 53:57)
with (53:54 - 54:00)
36 000 gems (53:57 - 54:02)
today (54:00 - 54:02)
i have ash (54:04 - 54:10)
and yeah (54:06 - 54:10)
it was look i got a lot of [ __ ] i can't (54:14 - 54:18)
be bad because i got a lot of five stars (54:16 - 54:21)
i finally got aleister and gengar i got (54:18 - 54:22)
a lot of things (54:21 - 54:25)
but i was like i don't really want red (54:22 - 54:26)
and (54:25 - 54:28)
pikachu and i'm okay with cynthia and (54:26 - 54:30)
lucario have extras (54:28 - 54:31)
but yeah i burned through literally on (54:30 - 54:34)
my gems to get ash (54:31 - 54:34)
didn't doesn't isn't korean karina in (54:37 - 54:42)
the game doesn't karina have mega (54:40 - 54:45)
lucario (54:42 - 54:47)
am i misremembering (54:45 - 54:49)
uh (54:47 - 54:49)
yes (54:50 - 54:53)
they are in the game (54:51 - 54:54)
yeah okay so (54:53 - 54:56)
before anyone goes like well charizard's (54:54 - 54:58)
in the game like four times yeah that's (54:56 - 55:00)
true leon has a gigantomax charizard and (54:58 - 55:02)
red has mega charizard and then your (55:00 - 55:05)
character can have a charizard (55:02 - 55:09)
but cynthia and karina both have mega (55:05 - 55:11)
lucario now there's no (55:09 - 55:12)
i i'm sure there's differences in the (55:11 - 55:14)
the attacks but (55:12 - 55:16)
yeah i mean they they do different (55:14 - 55:18)
things (55:16 - 55:19)
it it (55:18 - 55:23)
but like yeah i mean they exist (55:19 - 55:25)
and they're both existing (55:23 - 55:28)
at the same time (55:25 - 55:30)
so you could potentially have a a two (55:28 - 55:34)
lucario team (55:30 - 55:34)
i'm gonna even have a three charizard (55:34 - 55:37)
team too (55:36 - 55:40)
you can and i've done that (55:37 - 55:40)
will is there a single character that (55:42 - 55:48)
masters could add to bring you back nope (55:44 - 55:50)
i i just i hate the gameplay (55:48 - 55:52)
i absolutely hate the game (55:50 - 55:53)
you don't have to play the game though i (55:52 - 55:56)
don't actually play the game (55:53 - 56:00)
even worse okay (55:56 - 56:02)
cause it's like the tcg you can just (56:00 - 56:04)
collect the cards in the tcg you don't (56:02 - 56:05)
actually have to play the game part of (56:04 - 56:08)
it that is i i don't enjoy collecting (56:05 - 56:12)
the cards in the tcg i just (56:08 - 56:14)
okay i guess that's fair (56:12 - 56:17)
um the storyline for ash is (56:14 - 56:20)
uh here's the thing masters does duke (56:17 - 56:24)
fun not particularly deep but fun (56:20 - 56:28)
uh and cute storylines so ash being back (56:24 - 56:31)
and running around paizo is is charming (56:28 - 56:34)
passio please cassio (56:31 - 56:36)
oh ash is a one percent pole he's not a (56:34 - 56:38)
he's not two percent in a one percent (56:36 - 56:41)
but look so he is a master sink pair (56:38 - 56:44)
yeah which is the same as archie and (56:41 - 56:48)
maxie we have been saying since may save (56:44 - 56:50)
your gems for the third anniversary (56:48 - 56:52)
don't get distracted by all of that i (56:50 - 56:54)
told you everybody i got distracted by (56:52 - 56:56)
archie though i wanted that coyote you (56:54 - 56:59)
are a member you are a meme (56:56 - 57:02)
i tried to warn you (56:59 - 57:03)
um (57:02 - 57:05)
are there any other master sings pears (57:03 - 57:09)
or is ash the third one maxie archie (57:05 - 57:10)
um (57:09 - 57:11)
is (57:10 - 57:13)
wasn't there like a stephen that was a (57:11 - 57:15)
master yeah i think there's a stephen (57:13 - 57:18)
that's the master isn't cyrus a master (57:15 - 57:19)
oh i think (57:18 - 57:20)
yes (57:19 - 57:23)
uh there's there's been a number of them (57:20 - 57:25)
so it is cynthia (57:23 - 57:28)
and red gonna be mastering pearson (57:25 - 57:30)
probably (57:28 - 57:32)
i haven't really looked too deeply into (57:30 - 57:32)
the (57:32 - 57:35)
um (57:32 - 57:35)
i mean they're like the the uh (57:37 - 57:42)
i cannot think of the word people (57:42 - 57:46)
like doing research into the data mine (57:44 - 57:48)
the data not the data mine but like now (57:46 - 57:50)
that they're here (57:48 - 57:52)
like people have done research in to (57:50 - 57:54)
find out like what (57:52 - 57:55)
they do (57:54 - 57:56)
and how different they are and what (57:55 - 57:58)
they're considered (57:56 - 58:00)
um but like the website says it's three (57:58 - 58:03)
new master sync pairs so it looks like (58:00 - 58:04)
oh yeah yeah (58:03 - 58:07)
and signature red are all master sync (58:04 - 58:10)
pairs (58:07 - 58:10)
they also changed up (58:10 - 58:16)
they've added people to the bp list (58:13 - 58:18)
so there's new pairs you can get through (58:16 - 58:20)
battle points or whatever bp stands for (58:18 - 58:23)
in this game i forget (58:20 - 58:24)
um (58:23 - 58:27)
so they've added more uh they've added (58:24 - 58:29)
nida and landorus so people don't know (58:27 - 58:33)
who that is you need to look her up (58:29 - 58:33)
she's from the battle amazon uh will (58:34 - 58:39)
they added something called the trainer (58:37 - 58:42)
lounge i heard we talked about that last (58:39 - 58:43)
week (58:42 - 58:45)
and you you can you can form deep (58:43 - 58:47)
friendships with with your favorite (58:45 - 58:50)
trainers (58:47 - 58:50)
because you still have to play the game (58:53 - 58:58)
to get the rewards to put in the lounge (58:55 - 59:00)
no (58:58 - 59:02)
the lounge is really its own separate (59:00 - 59:04)
wheels yeah it's like its own separate (59:02 - 59:06)
it's currency (59:04 - 59:09)
it's a weird little thing they've added (59:06 - 59:11)
to this game and i don't (59:09 - 59:13)
i don't (59:11 - 59:14)
hate it (59:13 - 59:18)
i i like it (59:14 - 59:20)
added (59:18 - 59:23)
what this game didn't need is more items (59:20 - 59:26)
that make no sense and they said (59:23 - 59:29)
how about we add like 20 new items that (59:26 - 59:35)
only work in here and also make no sense (59:29 - 59:35)
yeah i don't know if this is another uh (59:36 - 59:41)
issue that i like i had with emblems and (59:38 - 59:43)
unite where i'm like emblems are dumb (59:41 - 59:44)
and then i like took (59:43 - 59:46)
45 minutes and i was like i'm just gonna (59:44 - 59:48)
figure this out and then i figured it (59:46 - 59:50)
out and i was like okay now i like them (59:48 - 59:52)
because i i put the work in it kind of (59:50 - 59:53)
sucked that i had to put the work in (59:52 - 59:55)
because i can imagine other people would (59:53 - 59:57)
be like this is too complicated and then (59:55 - 59:59)
once i understood how they worked i was (59:57 - 60:00)
like okay these are really cool i i (59:59 - 60:02)
always i'm curious if masters is that (60:00 - 60:04)
way in some instances where there's so (60:02 - 60:06)
many items and i'm just like i i could (60:04 - 60:08)
look this up and figure it out but like (60:06 - 60:11)
i get in i do my polls i have a great (60:08 - 60:14)
time i leave it's fine the issue with (60:11 - 60:17)
the items in the lodge (60:14 - 60:18)
is (60:17 - 60:20)
all the items that happen in the lodge (60:18 - 60:23)
seem to only affect things in the lodge (60:20 - 60:25)
and the only reason that you're doing (60:23 - 60:27)
the lodge is to get the certificates (60:25 - 60:30)
that allow you to raise certain pairs (60:27 - 60:35)
past the current limit of 140. (60:30 - 60:38)
so if you want to go up to the new limit (60:35 - 60:41)
of 150 but only on the select pairs that (60:38 - 60:42)
are allowed in the lodge you have to (60:41 - 60:46)
play the separate lodge game to get the (60:42 - 60:49)
items that are slightly confusing (60:46 - 60:51)
to be able to (60:49 - 60:53)
affect the main game (60:51 - 60:56)
and i barely have things at 140. (60:53 - 60:58)
so (60:56 - 61:01)
this is really one of those (60:58 - 61:03)
situations where if you are heavily (61:01 - 61:06)
invested in masters and you're like i (61:03 - 61:08)
gotta get these think pairs to 150 so (61:06 - 61:11)
that i have the best pairs to do the (61:08 - 61:12)
hardest (61:11 - 61:13)
stuff (61:12 - 61:15)
then i'll then you are spending a lot of (61:13 - 61:17)
time in the lodge and probably have it (61:15 - 61:19)
figured out as a person that's like (61:17 - 61:21)
all right i'll talk to you and we'll (61:19 - 61:24)
have a conversation for a while and then (61:21 - 61:25)
i'm gonna send you out to a volcano to (61:24 - 61:26)
look for stuff (61:25 - 61:28)
and then you're gonna bring me back (61:26 - 61:30)
stuff and i'm like okay what do i do (61:28 - 61:31)
with this stuff that you found at the (61:30 - 61:36)
volcano i don't understand (61:31 - 61:36)
it's it's weird because um (61:37 - 61:42)
so like i i have uh (61:39 - 61:45)
like a an agreement to contract whatever (61:42 - 61:46)
you want to call it with dna right a (61:45 - 61:47)
partnership which is probably the right (61:46 - 61:49)
words (61:47 - 61:51)
right like so when (61:49 - 61:55)
when i work with specific companies (61:51 - 61:57)
um i'll have to sign like paperwork or (61:55 - 61:59)
or contracts right like specifically for (61:57 - 62:01)
go fest with niantic i had to sign a (61:59 - 62:02)
specific contract where they wanted me (62:01 - 62:04)
to like tweet twice about go fest and (62:02 - 62:06)
use these hashtags and like uh talk (62:04 - 62:08)
about it on the podcast and stuff like (62:06 - 62:10)
that right like that was like a very (62:08 - 62:12)
specific contract with (62:10 - 62:13)
dna (62:12 - 62:14)
um (62:13 - 62:16)
you know they they approached me and (62:14 - 62:17)
they were like hey we're trying to put (62:16 - 62:19)
you know some content creators together (62:17 - 62:21)
for for masters and you know the pokemon (62:19 - 62:23)
company actually recommended you um and (62:21 - 62:25)
they you've already worked with niantic (62:23 - 62:28)
and stuff so um the vetting process for (62:25 - 62:30)
that was like pretty pretty seamless (62:28 - 62:33)
um for the for the record like i do have (62:30 - 62:35)
like a one-page contract with nintendo (62:33 - 62:37)
pretty much being like they'll send me (62:35 - 62:39)
like pokemon games (62:37 - 62:41)
every now and then in agreement that i (62:39 - 62:44)
wouldn't like play emulators or or like (62:41 - 62:46)
show people how to like hack right like (62:44 - 62:47)
that's like the one thing they care (62:46 - 62:48)
about the most is like they don't like (62:47 - 62:50)
emulation at all they don't like (62:48 - 62:51)
randomizers they don't like any of that (62:50 - 62:54)
stuff um (62:51 - 62:56)
uh i don't have any paperwork with the (62:54 - 62:58)
pokemon company itself like when they (62:56 - 63:00)
sent me out to worlds (62:58 - 63:03)
um i i didn't even sign anything for (63:00 - 63:04)
that they were just like we have a hotel (63:03 - 63:06)
for you and your name if you come you (63:04 - 63:09)
just say your name and the hotel room is (63:06 - 63:10)
yours like there was no paperwork or (63:09 - 63:12)
anything when they send me like tcg (63:10 - 63:13)
cards (63:12 - 63:15)
um the only thing i i have to say is (63:13 - 63:18)
like i i agree to the embargo (63:15 - 63:20)
you know can't open or talk about these (63:18 - 63:23)
cards until a certain day (63:20 - 63:25)
with with masters though (63:23 - 63:27)
they uh (63:25 - 63:30)
one of the things that they said was hey (63:27 - 63:32)
if you make youtube content the pokemon (63:30 - 63:35)
company doesn't like the word waifu (63:32 - 63:37)
uh and the pokemon company doesn't like (63:35 - 63:39)
the word like hasbano um you know these (63:37 - 63:41)
are just like japanese words for like (63:39 - 63:43)
you know wifey or whatnot right it's (63:41 - 63:46)
very let's say dubiously japanese words (63:43 - 63:49)
they're dubiously japanese (63:46 - 63:52)
very dubious and you know the main (63:49 - 63:54)
reason for that right is because they (63:52 - 63:56)
they don't want (63:54 - 64:00)
their characters to to come across as (63:56 - 64:01)
like (64:00 - 64:04)
dateable i guess is probably the most pg (64:01 - 64:06)
way i can say that (64:04 - 64:07)
which is like totally fair right like (64:06 - 64:09)
they don't want them to be sexualized (64:07 - 64:12)
that is still a pg way of saying that (64:09 - 64:13)
sure they don't want them to be (64:12 - 64:15)
sexualized (64:13 - 64:18)
uh which is totally fair right like (64:15 - 64:20)
if if they're giving you free gems or (64:18 - 64:21)
they're giving you free merchandise they (64:20 - 64:23)
don't want you to make content where (64:21 - 64:24)
it's like (64:23 - 64:28)
pushing boundaries on like their own ip (64:24 - 64:30)
so anytime i like open up master polls (64:28 - 64:33)
on on on twitch i'm like hey chat you (64:30 - 64:35)
know (64:33 - 64:37)
this is going on youtube dna is probably (64:35 - 64:38)
going to look at it and they might (64:37 - 64:40)
reshare it they might retweet it but (64:38 - 64:41)
like if you go out of your way to be (64:40 - 64:44)
like oh my gosh cynthia is so attractive (64:41 - 64:45)
it's like ah (64:44 - 64:47)
that's that that's not great like save (64:45 - 64:49)
it for after (64:47 - 64:51)
or just don't say it at all right like (64:49 - 64:53)
you know keep your fantasies to yourself (64:51 - 64:55)
um (64:53 - 64:57)
but now with this trainer lounge thing (64:55 - 64:59)
sorry that was like a long-winded (64:57 - 65:00)
explanation to get back to this trainer (64:59 - 65:01)
lounge (65:00 - 65:04)
like that is what it is though like yeah (65:01 - 65:07)
the the terminology is like (65:04 - 65:09)
forming deep friendships but you're (65:07 - 65:10)
you're like (65:09 - 65:13)
you're actively to me like flirting with (65:10 - 65:14)
them (65:13 - 65:16)
that is to you i'm having a pleasant (65:14 - 65:18)
conversation yeah the cynthia the (65:16 - 65:21)
champion who i admire (65:18 - 65:23)
and think has a great fighting and (65:21 - 65:25)
battle spirit (65:23 - 65:29)
you however are a pervert (65:25 - 65:31)
so this this is pulled from other games (65:29 - 65:35)
i have n in mine and not once has and (65:31 - 65:37)
asked me out to (65:35 - 65:40)
go to a ferris wheel (65:37 - 65:40)
what do you think happens greg when you (65:40 - 65:43)
get him to like level 10 he's probably (65:42 - 65:45)
gonna ask you finally for that ferris (65:43 - 65:46)
wheel trip (65:45 - 65:48)
i mean the answer is yes (65:46 - 65:49)
okay (65:48 - 65:54)
but this this mechanic i i believe or (65:49 - 65:57)
this mechanic the the the concept of the (65:54 - 65:59)
quote-unquote trainer lounge i'm air (65:57 - 66:01)
quoting for the podcast um (65:59 - 66:03)
is something that's like pulled from the (66:01 - 66:06)
game i think of this fire emblem (66:03 - 66:08)
uh where they have like (66:06 - 66:11)
you can mingle with with your i don't (66:08 - 66:13)
know what they're called in fire emblem (66:11 - 66:14)
your army your (66:13 - 66:17)
troops your troops your characters um (66:14 - 66:19)
and i think gentian impact has something (66:17 - 66:21)
similar to this i i haven't played (66:19 - 66:24)
gentian so i'm not 100 sure (66:21 - 66:26)
but like like the trainer lounge isn't (66:24 - 66:28)
unique to masters that other games have (66:26 - 66:31)
done something similar to that (66:28 - 66:33)
but also like (66:31 - 66:35)
going back to fire emblem (66:33 - 66:37)
like that that is uh that is the thing (66:35 - 66:39)
that people really like about those (66:37 - 66:41)
people really like fire emblem (66:39 - 66:43)
characters (66:41 - 66:45)
um that's why there's so many of them in (66:43 - 66:47)
uh smash brothers (66:45 - 66:49)
yep (66:47 - 66:51)
true (66:49 - 66:51)
um (66:51 - 66:56)
yeah i i'm i'm with greg i don't hate it (66:52 - 67:00)
but i don't know how i feel about it (66:56 - 67:01)
yeah i mean i think that the problem (67:00 - 67:03)
that you're running into is it uses a (67:01 - 67:05)
similar (67:03 - 67:08)
interface and actions that you find on (67:05 - 67:11)
many dating simulation video games (67:08 - 67:13)
correct if you were to play a game such (67:11 - 67:15)
as dream daddy (67:13 - 67:18)
you will have very similar interactions (67:15 - 67:19)
as you're finding in the trainer's (67:18 - 67:21)
lounge (67:19 - 67:23)
so my experience with these interactions (67:21 - 67:26)
or these questions that they ask is my (67:23 - 67:30)
you ever you ever been to like no us a (67:26 - 67:33)
site on the internet why yes you have (67:30 - 67:36)
i mean have you ever been like perusing (67:33 - 67:38)
the internet and you get like these ads (67:36 - 67:40)
for like these dating games (67:38 - 67:42)
and you're like who who is playing these (67:40 - 67:44)
dating games (67:42 - 67:46)
my wife your wife (67:44 - 67:48)
i know who it is (67:46 - 67:51)
my wife is this per for years i'm seeing (67:48 - 67:54)
ads for these these these uh very out (67:51 - 67:56)
there dating games (67:54 - 67:58)

like who is who's clicking these links (67:58 - 68:02)
who's playing these games my wife is she (68:00 - 68:05)
loves dating simulators absolutely loves (68:02 - 68:07)
them she loves the like the the story (68:05 - 68:09)
and like falling in love and who's (68:07 - 68:11)
dating who it's like the it's like the (68:09 - 68:14)
2020 version of those romance novels (68:11 - 68:16)
that (68:14 - 68:19)
you mean romance novels that still exist (68:16 - 68:20)
yeah they are (68:19 - 68:24)
and are make millions they make bank (68:20 - 68:26)
but like like when i watch her like when (68:24 - 68:28)
she's like playing she has there's a lot (68:26 - 68:30)
of these on the switch by the way (68:28 - 68:31)
there's a lot of these dating simulators (68:30 - 68:32)
on the switch and (68:31 - 68:35)
when when she's like playing playing it (68:32 - 68:36)
in the background and i'm like looking (68:35 - 68:39)
up it it is ultimately like the trainer (68:36 - 68:41)
lounge is a very simplified version of (68:39 - 68:44)
that of like oh very simplified uh (68:41 - 68:47)
except for the items that there's a ton (68:44 - 68:49)
of them (68:47 - 68:49)
what is going on why do i have (68:49 - 68:53)
why are we gonna hold my hand all right (68:51 - 68:56)
why do we have four different (68:53 - 69:01)
oddly colored triforces what is going on (68:56 - 69:01)
i i'm i'm glad masters is is (69:02 - 69:09)
experimenting oh yeah (69:07 - 69:13)
um because i think (69:09 - 69:13)
i i i've always gotten the feeling (69:13 - 69:19)
that they they tried very heavily to (69:16 - 69:22)
make a unique bat this is my opinion i i (69:19 - 69:24)
don't i don't you know they they they (69:22 - 69:27)
didn't tell me their opinion but like (69:24 - 69:29)
watching (69:27 - 69:32)
watching masters grow and and working (69:29 - 69:35)
with dna again my opinion (69:32 - 69:38)
it seems like they at the start they (69:35 - 69:40)
tried so hard to like get people into (69:38 - 69:42)
the battle system and to understand the (69:40 - 69:44)
battle system and appreciate the battle (69:42 - 69:45)
system (69:44 - 69:49)
and now and now it feels like (69:45 - 69:51)
they are just doubling down based on the (69:49 - 69:53)
surveys that we all took remember they (69:51 - 69:55)
like listened to us that we took all (69:53 - 69:57)
these surveys and the the thing on the (69:55 - 69:59)
surveys that won was like more (69:57 - 70:00)
characters more seasonals more (69:59 - 70:03)
collectibles and ever since that survey (70:00 - 70:04)
it felt like (70:03 - 70:06)
cut the co-op (70:04 - 70:08)
no one's using it it's too complicated (70:06 - 70:10)
let's not worry about the battle system (70:08 - 70:11)
so much let's just worry about (70:10 - 70:14)
collecting and new characters and all (70:11 - 70:17)
that stuff and now because (70:14 - 70:18)
i feel (70:17 - 70:20)
that there are probably a huge amount of (70:18 - 70:22)
players and masters that care about the (70:20 - 70:24)
collecting aspect i am one of those (70:22 - 70:26)
players i don't actually like do the (70:24 - 70:29)
battle stuff i i just like collecting (70:26 - 70:30)
and i know there are a bunch of people (70:29 - 70:32)
that like the battle stuff that's fine (70:30 - 70:34)
totally cool (70:32 - 70:35)
but it seems like they're like okay (70:34 - 70:37)
we've gotten all these people to collect (70:35 - 70:39)
and to spend gems (70:37 - 70:42)
how can we get them to want to spend and (70:39 - 70:45)
collect more because the battling itself (70:42 - 70:46)
isn't doing it (70:45 - 70:48)
yeah it feels like the trainer lounge is (70:46 - 70:52)
the foundation to try to like (70:48 - 70:52)
get those people to want to do something (70:52 - 70:56)
with their collection which is like (70:54 - 70:58)
totally cool and totally fair (70:56 - 71:00)
but it's it's kind of i feel like (70:58 - 71:02)
there's there's been this slow shift (71:00 - 71:04)
away from the (71:02 - 71:06)
the very focused battle mechanic that (71:04 - 71:08)
they led with (71:06 - 71:10)
now to this (71:08 - 71:14)
collecting aspect of the game (71:10 - 71:14)
they've come a long way from hey we're (71:15 - 71:21)
sorry we bailed the bad game (71:17 - 71:21)
which is where we were when this i don't (71:21 - 71:25)
think the battling stuff is bad i just (71:23 - 71:28)
think it's overly complicated (71:25 - 71:30)
and if you like that that is awesome and (71:28 - 71:33)
i i see (71:30 - 71:35)
and i see the challenge of like (71:33 - 71:37)
okay you have to activate this and then (71:35 - 71:39)
do this and then wait till this and then (71:37 - 71:40)
like put the thing to sleep with (71:39 - 71:42)
hypnosis and then do that like i i (71:40 - 71:44)
unders i like when i watch people do it (71:42 - 71:47)
i'm like wow that's really cool (71:44 - 71:49)
no thank you (71:47 - 71:51)
yeah i mean i think they did a very good (71:49 - 71:52)
thing by building the victory road part (71:51 - 71:55)
that teaches you like this is what we (71:52 - 71:57)
mean by doing all these things and i (71:55 - 71:59)
think (71:57 - 72:00)
like (71:59 - 72:03)
ultimately they also understood like (72:00 - 72:05)
people just like (72:03 - 72:07)
people want these characters to mean (72:05 - 72:09)
something and this is (72:07 - 72:12)
when i realized why i've been enjoying (72:09 - 72:13)
masters more than anything it's what (72:12 - 72:16)
i've always wanted the main games to do (72:13 - 72:18)
with these gym leaders right (72:16 - 72:20)
i want to know them i want to see their (72:18 - 72:22)
story lines i want to see their (72:20 - 72:24)
personalities i want them to be much (72:22 - 72:27)
more than i walked into your gym i (72:24 - 72:30)
stomped you out of existence and i left (72:27 - 72:32)
and masters takes these characters that (72:30 - 72:34)
i have (72:32 - 72:36)
lived within these games and gives them (72:34 - 72:39)
personality and a story (72:36 - 72:41)
and something for me to make them (72:39 - 72:43)
memorable i remember more gym leaders (72:41 - 72:46)
now and elite four members after playing (72:43 - 72:48)
masters than i ever did from the main (72:46 - 72:51)
series games and that is its main credit (72:48 - 72:53)
i think (72:51 - 72:55)
yeah (72:53 - 72:55)
uh speaking of a bunch of items i know (72:55 - 72:59)
you guys went over this last week (72:57 - 73:02)
um although i know that the the three of (72:59 - 73:04)
you aren't exactly the most competitive (73:02 - 73:06)
people uh (73:04 - 73:08)
um so i i just wanted to give my input (73:06 - 73:10)
on on the the new items that i announced (73:08 - 73:11)
in battles (73:10 - 73:13)
uh (73:11 - 73:14)
and i think we i think we even got like (73:13 - 73:16)
a comment of like oh i wish there was (73:14 - 73:19)
more insight on these items (73:16 - 73:20)
um (73:19 - 73:21)
although i don't i don't have the full (73:20 - 73:24)
list here (73:21 - 73:26)
um (73:24 - 73:27)
full insight because we don't know (73:26 - 73:30)
exactly how they're working (73:27 - 73:31)
i'm gonna say like (73:30 - 73:34)
we can guess (73:31 - 73:36)
but like we don't there's always (73:34 - 73:39)
something like oh they are excluding x (73:36 - 73:43)
or y like we are still guessing exactly (73:39 - 73:45)
how they're going to work (73:43 - 73:48)
yeah no i no i feel like because like (73:45 - 73:48)
there's (73:48 - 73:51)
like six new items and i'm on (73:48 - 73:53)
scarlet and violet and i'm only seeing (73:51 - 73:55)
uh (73:53 - 73:56)
they didn't announce six new items they (73:55 - 73:58)
only announced three (73:56 - 74:00)
oh (73:58 - 74:02)
i thought i saw stick somewhere the herb (74:00 - 74:04)
the cloak yeah (74:02 - 74:07)
dice the dice nice (74:04 - 74:08)
is that so like (74:07 - 74:10)
the questions like i had people ask me (74:08 - 74:12)
like okay do you think covert clothe (74:10 - 74:14)
will stop the confusion from things like (74:12 - 74:15)
swagger (74:14 - 74:17)
maybe (74:15 - 74:18)
probably (74:17 - 74:20)
i don't know for sure does swagger do (74:18 - 74:24)
damage no because swagger is so no right (74:20 - 74:26)
it's it's like effects it's secondary (74:24 - 74:29)
effects so is raising their attack (74:26 - 74:32)
secondary effect also causes confusion i (74:29 - 74:35)
don't know how they're going to do that (74:32 - 74:37)
like i don't have that answer because we (74:35 - 74:39)
don't know yet (74:37 - 74:42)
so we are guessing as to how they work (74:39 - 74:44)
and yet it would be very cool if like (74:42 - 74:47)
the swagger confusion part didn't happen (74:44 - 74:49)
because it's considered a secondary (74:47 - 74:51)
effect but they may not consider that a (74:49 - 74:53)
secondary effect (74:51 - 74:57)
i i don't know (74:53 - 74:57)
um correct (74:57 - 75:03)
where was there was a where was it where (75:00 - 75:06)
they had like pictures of the items (75:03 - 75:07)
all right (75:06 - 75:09)
website (75:07 - 75:09)
no i'm there there's no like little (75:10 - 75:14)
pictures of like the covert cloak look (75:11 - 75:16)
like uh (75:14 - 75:18)
something (75:16 - 75:20)
no there there is another item that's (75:18 - 75:21)
what i'm saying like on the website it (75:20 - 75:23)
there's a there's an item where like a (75:21 - 75:26)
pokemon cannot take damage (75:23 - 75:26)
if it if they have like a certain amount (75:27 - 75:31)
of hp (75:29 - 75:32)
that they didn't show in the trailer but (75:31 - 75:34)
they put on the website no no the covert (75:32 - 75:36)
cloak is the one that was not in the (75:34 - 75:37)
trailer but (75:36 - 75:40)
is on the website (75:37 - 75:40)
no they show cover cloak in the trailer (75:43 - 75:46)
because they have the screenshots in the (75:44 - 75:47)
trailer didn't they no it's not in the (75:46 - 75:49)
trailer it is not in the trailer but (75:47 - 75:51)
there's there's an (75:49 - 75:53)
item (75:51 - 75:57)
that uh prevents damage (75:53 - 75:59)
the the covert well the secondary (75:57 - 76:01)
effects i don't know no no no it it's (75:59 - 76:04)
it's it's like hp based (76:01 - 76:06)
and i can't find it i think you've (76:04 - 76:09)
imagined something that's not exactly i (76:06 - 76:12)
don't remember like i saw on (76:09 - 76:15)
i went and like kataku has mere herb (76:12 - 76:17)
covert cloak and loaded dice which we (76:15 - 76:20)
all talked about (76:17 - 76:22)
i don't know where this hp thing is that (76:20 - 76:23)
you (76:22 - 76:25)
am i am i (76:23 - 76:27)
was like did you go into this (76:25 - 76:29)
i opened in lost origin that i just like (76:27 - 76:31)
merged in and thought it was (76:29 - 76:34)
probably (76:31 - 76:34)
loaded dice (76:40 - 76:42)
are you thinking of the um ability that (76:47 - 76:51)
lets him (76:50 - 76:54)
drop his tail (76:51 - 76:54)
now the japanese website only has the (76:55 - 76:58)
three either no i'm not thinking of the (76:56 - 77:01)
ability that has the tail (76:58 - 77:04)
uh okay so so mere herb this uh this (77:01 - 77:06)
herb allows the holder to mirror an (77:04 - 77:08)
opponent's stat increase and boost its (77:06 - 77:11)
own stats but only once (77:08 - 77:13)
um so there's a there's an item in the (77:11 - 77:16)
game that became very popular um near (77:13 - 77:18)
the end of competitive and you probably (77:16 - 77:19)
saw it if you watched the world (77:18 - 77:21)
championships (77:19 - 77:23)
and that item was called white herb (77:21 - 77:24)
um (77:23 - 77:26)
and white white herb became more and (77:24 - 77:29)
more used throughout the series 12 i (77:26 - 77:31)
think we're on (77:29 - 77:33)
um and and it was rarely i shouldn't say (77:31 - 77:35)
rarely (77:33 - 77:36)
no i will say really it was like rarely (77:35 - 77:38)
used in earlier seasons just because (77:36 - 77:41)
there was different items but um (77:38 - 77:43)
white herb prevented (77:41 - 77:45)
uh stat reductions so because of the (77:43 - 77:47)
amount of incineroars that existed um (77:45 - 77:49)
like incineroar would come out it would (77:47 - 77:51)
intimidate you you would be negative one (77:49 - 77:53)
um and then you wouldn't be able to do (77:51 - 77:55)
enough damage to knock out whatever is (77:53 - 77:56)
next to incineroar or incineroar (77:55 - 77:59)
themselves so you would see white herb (77:56 - 78:01)
exist on pokemon like (77:59 - 78:05)
uh ice rider calorics or groudon (78:01 - 78:06)
and i actually think um some of the (78:05 - 78:08)
groudons that made it to the (78:06 - 78:11)
to the like top four were all running (78:08 - 78:13)
white herbs (78:11 - 78:15)
so (78:13 - 78:18)
i think mere herb would see a lot of (78:15 - 78:21)
play uh if if we (78:18 - 78:22)
if we see like a swords dance dragon (78:21 - 78:26)
dance meta which was a very popular meta (78:22 - 78:28)
it's actually how i qualified for (78:26 - 78:31)
players cup 2 is i used indeedy to (78:28 - 78:34)
follow me and then i used dragopalt and (78:31 - 78:36)
i would just dragon dance and if i was (78:34 - 78:37)
in a situation where i was able to (78:36 - 78:39)
dragon dance i would i would be in a (78:37 - 78:42)
pretty good spot to then start to sweep (78:39 - 78:43)
so (78:42 - 78:46)
that that's the only like real situation (78:43 - 78:50)
i would see mere herb in because um (78:46 - 78:50)
i i feel like this would make more sense (78:50 - 78:55)
in a dynamax format where the (78:52 - 78:57)
the holder is to mirror an opponent's (78:55 - 78:59)
stat increase and boost its own stat (78:57 - 79:01)
well the thing about dynamax pokemon is (78:59 - 79:03)
you are boosting your own stats whether (79:01 - 79:06)
that's like through max airstream (79:03 - 79:08)
or max knuckle but i don't think we're (79:06 - 79:09)
getting (79:08 - 79:11)
doesn't look like terrastilizing does (79:09 - 79:12)
that (79:11 - 79:14)
so then the the only other moves you (79:12 - 79:15)
have to like think about would be like (79:14 - 79:18)
swords dance dragon dance um coil (79:15 - 79:20)
belly another one (79:18 - 79:21)
belly drum (79:20 - 79:23)
yeah because that's the show in the (79:21 - 79:25)
trailer (79:23 - 79:27)
uh so i don't know if this sees i don't (79:25 - 79:30)
know if mere herb sees a lot of play (79:27 - 79:33)
unless the meta leans into like (79:30 - 79:34)
so (79:33 - 79:36)
i did you listen to us last week i did (79:34 - 79:38)
not get to that point so here's the (79:36 - 79:39)
thing that we brought up and maybe you (79:38 - 79:41)
can (79:39 - 79:44)
shut so one do we think that like a (79:41 - 79:46)
snorlax could get this herb back through (79:44 - 79:49)
recycle (79:46 - 79:49)
no (79:49 - 79:52)
because you can you not get the herb (79:50 - 79:54)
back there with the thing (79:52 - 79:55)
is back (79:54 - 79:57)
because this is items (79:55 - 80:00)
this this isn't harvest this is harvest (79:57 - 80:03)
this is recycle (80:00 - 80:03)
well typing recycle into google without (80:04 - 80:07)
the word pokemon gets you uh local (80:05 - 80:10)
recycling plants (80:07 - 80:10)
although you're wasting a move (80:14 - 80:18)
uh recycle allows a user to regain a (80:21 - 80:26)
hailed item such as a berry (80:24 - 80:28)
that the user has consumed in battle (80:26 - 80:31)
recycle has failed if the user already (80:28 - 80:33)
has a held item consumed items are not (80:31 - 80:35)
forgotten even if the pokemon is (80:33 - 80:36)
switched out (80:35 - 80:38)
recycle cannot restore items that were (80:36 - 80:40)
transferred to a different pokemon via (80:38 - 80:42)
thief or an item knocked out or or items (80:40 - 80:44)
that were knocked off but can recover (80:42 - 80:47)
items by consumed by bug bite fling (80:44 - 80:49)
natural gift and pluck (80:47 - 80:53)
recycle can recover items consumed (80:49 - 80:55)
that were originally another's pokemon (80:53 - 80:57)
but was transferred to that (80:55 - 81:00)
pokemon during battle however (80:57 - 81:02)
pokemon may only consume one item at a (81:00 - 81:06)
time if a pokemon consumes an item then (81:02 - 81:09)
obtains another i uh obtains another and (81:06 - 81:11)
consumes it the original item cannot be (81:09 - 81:12)
restored (81:11 - 81:14)
even if the second item is restored and (81:12 - 81:16)
transferred to another pokemon this is (81:14 - 81:18)
the most complicated move ever yes (81:16 - 81:20)
if the pokemon that knows recycle (81:18 - 81:22)
obtains an item after consuming one it (81:20 - 81:24)
can still recycle to restore its old (81:22 - 81:26)
item as long as it has no item when (81:24 - 81:28)
using recycle and did not consume (81:26 - 81:31)
another item once consuming the old item (81:28 - 81:33)
once an item is restored it is no longer (81:31 - 81:35)
treated as a consumed item so it cannot (81:33 - 81:36)
be restored again until it's consumed (81:35 - 81:37)
again (81:36 - 81:40)
in generation 5 it says recycle can no (81:37 - 81:43)
longer restore via bug bite and pluck (81:40 - 81:46)
recycle cannot restore a bursted air (81:43 - 81:47)
balloon (81:46 - 81:50)
an item destroyed by incinerate or (81:47 - 81:53)
another item picked up by a pokemon via (81:50 - 81:54)
pickup (81:53 - 81:57)
if powered up by normal oh gosh i can't (81:54 - 82:00)
i forgot about our valley of z (81:57 - 82:02)
so poorly named (82:00 - 82:04)
uh (82:02 - 82:06)
if it if it's powered up by normalian z (82:04 - 82:09)
into z recycle the user speed will (82:06 - 82:10)
increase by two stages then the move (82:09 - 82:13)
itself will fail after obtaining the z (82:10 - 82:15)
move because it's not possible to (82:13 - 82:18)
restore its own z crystal (82:15 - 82:20)
recycle can restore a berry user's berry (82:18 - 82:23)
if it was consumed by tea time what is t (82:20 - 82:27)
time a move (82:23 - 82:27)
it's the signature move of a pulte geist (82:27 - 82:33)
nobody uses it like clearly (82:30 - 82:35)
it causes all pokemon on the field to (82:33 - 82:37)
eat um so (82:35 - 82:40)
would snorlax be able to recycle this (82:37 - 82:43)
yeah i would say yes based on based on (82:40 - 82:45)
that and then the other question that we (82:43 - 82:47)
had that you is (82:45 - 82:49)
but like it (82:47 - 82:52)
the so let's say on both sides of the (82:49 - 82:56)
field both pokemon use a power (82:52 - 82:59)
uh a stat increasing move (82:56 - 83:01)
it will probably be random which one it (82:59 - 83:04)
picks or will it be speed based (83:01 - 83:06)
it would it would be speed based because (83:04 - 83:08)
that's that's how um (83:06 - 83:11)
so like (83:08 - 83:11)
if you're (83:11 - 83:14)
if it let's just say your um (83:15 - 83:20)
your snorlax has a mere herb (83:18 - 83:23)
and then what what's in front of you is (83:20 - 83:25)
um a dragopalt and a guard chomp and (83:23 - 83:28)
when dragon paul uses dragon dance the (83:25 - 83:30)
mirror herb would then activate and then (83:28 - 83:32)
the garchomp would sword stance (83:30 - 83:34)
so i don't think it would be it would (83:32 - 83:35)
there's no way it'd be random it would (83:34 - 83:39)
be like through speed tears (83:35 - 83:39)
i i don't (83:41 - 83:45)
i mean i don't think you would see mere (83:43 - 83:48)
herb on a on a snorlax (83:45 - 83:50)
because you're still you're still better (83:48 - 83:51)
off (83:50 - 83:53)
with like a citrus berry or whatever (83:51 - 83:56)
berry that snorlax particularly runs (83:53 - 83:59)
because you you want to then belly drum (83:56 - 84:00)
and then (83:59 - 84:01)
activate your berry to get your health (84:00 - 84:04)
back yeah but if you have a mental herb (84:01 - 84:05)
and somebody across the way belly drums (84:04 - 84:07)
then hey (84:05 - 84:09)
you're not mentally recycle it and say (84:07 - 84:11)
belly drum again and you got it again (84:09 - 84:12)
you would get that mental herb on like (84:11 - 84:13)
mimikyu (84:12 - 84:15)
um (84:13 - 84:18)
yeah i i (84:15 - 84:18)
i don't think mirror herb is like this (84:18 - 84:22)
this s-tier item (84:20 - 84:24)
um (84:22 - 84:25)
i don't i don't think it's at the same (84:24 - 84:27)
level as like a life orb or an assault (84:25 - 84:32)
vest or a focus sash or (84:27 - 84:32)
those those are probably the top three (84:32 - 84:36)
items i would i would probably (84:34 - 84:37)
say (84:36 - 84:39)
um (84:37 - 84:39)
covert covert cloak is probably an s to (84:41 - 84:49)
your item which is this (84:46 - 84:52)
this cloak can uh conceals the holder (84:49 - 84:54)
protecting it against additional effects (84:52 - 84:56)
of move at moves and the the one that (84:54 - 85:01)
they showed was fake out (84:56 - 85:01)
um so you would still take the damage of (85:01 - 85:05)
the fake out you just wouldn't be (85:03 - 85:07)
flinched (85:05 - 85:09)
uh and i'm assuming what you guys said (85:07 - 85:10)
last week because i didn't get to that (85:09 - 85:12)
part of the episode is like does this (85:10 - 85:13)
work (85:12 - 85:15)
on (85:13 - 85:18)
um like swagger does this work on skald (85:15 - 85:19)
does this work on (85:18 - 85:23)
um dynamic punch does this work on (85:19 - 85:24)
uh (85:23 - 85:27)
like thunderbolts isn't like you can't (85:24 - 85:28)
be like i think thunderbolt has like a (85:27 - 85:32)
10 chance of paralysizing you (85:28 - 85:32)
um (85:32 - 85:36)
and i would i would assume yes like i (85:33 - 85:38)
would (85:36 - 85:40)
i would assume that like (85:38 - 85:43)
it would prevent the burn from scald (85:40 - 85:45)
but you can still be scalded you can (85:43 - 85:47)
still be thunderbolted but you can't get (85:45 - 85:50)
the 10 burn (85:47 - 85:53)
but if the move is specifically (85:50 - 85:55)
like (85:53 - 85:56)
willow wisp (85:55 - 85:59)
willowists yeah you can't the the that (85:56 - 86:01)
is not the secondary effect right so (85:59 - 86:03)
like the question that i think we got in (86:01 - 86:06)
that people got into the weeds again are (86:03 - 86:10)
like swagger the main thing is (86:06 - 86:12)
you increase their (86:10 - 86:13)
attack (86:12 - 86:15)
the secondary effect is they become (86:13 - 86:18)
confused potentially so i think there's (86:15 - 86:21)
just a lot of questions we can't exactly (86:18 - 86:23)
answer until the item is here (86:21 - 86:26)
yeah so a good example of of how that (86:23 - 86:28)
would work without this item existing (86:26 - 86:30)
would be like mudsdale mudsdale's (86:28 - 86:31)
ability is (86:30 - 86:34)
is it like oblivious or something (86:31 - 86:35)
um (86:34 - 86:38)
uh where a very popular thing in season (86:35 - 86:40)
series three (86:38 - 86:43)
was that uh mudsdale would be alongside (86:40 - 86:46)
a grim snarl and grim snarls prankster (86:43 - 86:47)
ability would allow it to use (86:46 - 86:50)
non-damaging attacks first so grim snarl (86:47 - 86:53)
would use swagger on mudsdale give (86:50 - 86:56)
mudsdale a plus two but because mudsdale (86:53 - 86:58)
is ability prevents confusion it would (86:56 - 87:00)
just be a plus two priority (86:58 - 87:04)
sorry it was a own tempo (87:00 - 87:04)
my suspicion is anything that is (87:06 - 87:10)
affected by sheer force ability would (87:08 - 87:14)
also be covert cloak (87:10 - 87:14)
so sheer forces any damaging move that (87:15 - 87:19)
has a secondary effect the power is (87:17 - 87:21)
increased but (87:19 - 87:24)
the secondary effect doesn't go off (87:21 - 87:27)
so if (87:24 - 87:27)
if you're worried about being burned (87:30 - 87:38)
you would probably so so being burned is (87:34 - 87:40)
is a pretty (87:38 - 87:40)
pretty terrible thing to happen to you (87:41 - 87:44)
competitively (87:42 - 87:46)
i mean a terrible thing to happen ever (87:44 - 87:49)
yeah it's just being burned is bad (87:46 - 87:50)
so so if you're if you're burned your (87:49 - 87:52)
damage is your damage attack is is (87:50 - 87:54)
halved um which which in a dynamax (87:52 - 87:58)
format if if you dynamax to (87:54 - 88:00)
is it just your physical attack that's (87:58 - 88:01)
happened it's your physical yeah so if (88:00 - 88:04)
you if you dynamics and then you your (88:01 - 88:06)
your attack is halved it almost feels (88:04 - 88:09)
like you're you you're this huge sitting (88:06 - 88:12)
duck although i felt although (88:09 - 88:13)
they (88:12 - 88:16)
are free to and very may well (88:13 - 88:20)
change all of that in scarlet and violet (88:16 - 88:21)
we do not know (88:20 - 88:25)
yeah we don't know if frostbite from (88:21 - 88:28)
legends is coming over (88:25 - 88:31)
i also felt like (88:28 - 88:33)
instead of a losing attack (88:31 - 88:35)
being on fire should have reduced your (88:33 - 88:36)
accuracy because you're flailing around (88:35 - 88:39)
trying to put those fires those flames (88:36 - 88:42)
out it's your ouchy like a sunburn (88:39 - 88:44)
not your arm you take damage from it (88:42 - 88:48)
every time you are clearly on fire (88:44 - 88:49)
um (88:48 - 88:51)
yeah yeah so (88:49 - 88:53)
uh like (88:51 - 88:56)
lumbery (88:53 - 88:57)
landorus (88:56 - 89:00)
was very popular because (88:57 - 89:02)
you didn't want your landorus to be (89:00 - 89:03)
burned (89:02 - 89:06)
so if you if you dynamax to max (89:03 - 89:08)
airstream to get the speed advantage (89:06 - 89:10)
the way to counter that was like yeah (89:08 - 89:12)
you have the speed but now you're burned (89:10 - 89:14)
um and so they rode around lumbery to (89:12 - 89:15)
then heal the burn (89:14 - 89:17)
so then they can continue their sweep (89:15 - 89:18)
because (89:17 - 89:19)
they (89:18 - 89:21)
now they're now their attack is back to (89:19 - 89:22)
100 (89:21 - 89:24)
and they can continue doing what they (89:22 - 89:25)
were doing (89:24 - 89:27)
so (89:25 - 89:27)
like covert cloak isn't going to replace (89:28 - 89:33)
that right because it's not going to (89:31 - 89:36)
prevent against willow wisp (89:33 - 89:39)
uh but i suppose you you could be (89:36 - 89:41)
scalded and then like i don't want to (89:39 - 89:43)
get burned from the skull but that's (89:41 - 89:45)
that like skull is a 30 (89:43 - 89:47)
so i think lumber is still really good (89:45 - 89:49)
in that situation not this item this (89:47 - 89:51)
item seems specifically very good for (89:49 - 89:53)
fake out (89:51 - 89:54)
uh of like (89:53 - 89:57)
i i need to (89:54 - 89:58)
i need to dragon dance or i need to do (89:57 - 90:02)
something or i need to swords dance (89:58 - 90:04)
and i can't be faked out and the (90:02 - 90:07)
even if you don't need to like (90:04 - 90:08)
or i need to set up tailwind that's like (90:07 - 90:09)
another thing like i don't want to be (90:08 - 90:11)
faked out but i need to set up tailwind (90:09 - 90:13)
probably tailwind is the better example (90:11 - 90:15)
i need to set up tailwind i can't be (90:13 - 90:16)
faked out i don't have any way to (90:15 - 90:18)
prevent fake out that was that that is (90:16 - 90:19)
why (90:18 - 90:22)
max airstream was so good and probably (90:19 - 90:25)
the best max move because when you're (90:22 - 90:29)
dynamaxed you can't be faked out (90:25 - 90:29)
so (90:30 - 90:34)
if you're in a situation where like fake (90:31 - 90:36)
out is very popular and i'll never (90:34 - 90:37)
forget when we were in dc and they (90:36 - 90:39)
showed how like dynamaxx pokemon can't (90:37 - 90:41)
be faked out like the entire room like (90:39 - 90:43)
cheered because fake out is incredibly (90:41 - 90:45)
obnoxious and annoying and very (90:43 - 90:47)
disruptive (90:45 - 90:50)
and that's why incineroar is and really (90:47 - 90:52)
boom or some of these dominant pokemon (90:50 - 90:53)
because you know you fake out and then (90:52 - 90:54)
you switch them out and then you bring (90:53 - 90:56)
them back in and you can fake out again (90:54 - 90:58)
and fake out pressure is very very real (90:56 - 91:02)
but if you're if you're sitting against (90:58 - 91:04)
um you know a (91:02 - 91:07)
dragapaltz and a reggie eleki (91:04 - 91:09)
only one of those pokemon can be faked (91:07 - 91:12)
out the other one cannot (91:09 - 91:15)
and so if that one pokemon that you (91:12 - 91:18)
could fake out has this item all of a (91:15 - 91:21)
sudden you are now facing two incredibly (91:18 - 91:24)
fast pokemon and you cannot do anything (91:21 - 91:26)
to slow down even one of them which (91:24 - 91:27)
would be the eleki because you can't (91:26 - 91:30)
fake out dragonite (91:27 - 91:32)
um so yeah i think that that item will (91:30 - 91:35)
be incredibly popular and and probably (91:32 - 91:38)
the best out of the three here (91:35 - 91:39)
um (91:38 - 91:41)
but i don't know the situation which is (91:39 - 91:43)
going to be like (91:41 - 91:45)
best because you could we know that (91:43 - 91:47)
grimstar was going to be in the game (91:45 - 91:48)
and like you could easily fake out a (91:47 - 91:50)
grim snarl and you probably would want (91:48 - 91:51)
to if you don't want it to set up (91:50 - 91:52)
screens (91:51 - 91:55)
but like is that item best on grim snarl (91:52 - 91:57)
is it that big of a deal they fake out (91:55 - 92:00)
your grim style like versus (91:57 - 92:02)
i want a different item on grimstar (92:00 - 92:03)
which would be better (92:02 - 92:07)
so i i don't know if that's like (92:03 - 92:07)
i don't know if that's like the best (92:07 - 92:11)
item for that pokemon but um (92:08 - 92:12)
i think that that's probably the (92:11 - 92:14)
strongest item they showed the last item (92:12 - 92:16)
was uh what was it called it was like (92:14 - 92:19)
loaded with dice loaded dice yeah (92:16 - 92:23)
i think this is probably the worst item (92:19 - 92:26)
uh and i think this item feels more (92:23 - 92:28)
for single play (92:26 - 92:31)
uh where as as like (92:28 - 92:34)
um (92:31 - 92:35)
though the pokemon i think of when i the (92:34 - 92:37)
pokemon i thought of when they first (92:35 - 92:39)
started this item was like cloister (92:37 - 92:40)
because cloister has like a very (92:39 - 92:43)
specific gimmick where it does uh wha (92:40 - 92:44)
what is it it's not like (92:43 - 92:47)
it's skill link so it does (92:44 - 92:50)
uh it has a bunch of multi hit moves (92:47 - 92:52)
yeah icicle spear (92:50 - 92:55)
um (92:52 - 92:58)
is it is it (92:55 - 92:58)
is what's pokemon it's also like rock (92:58 - 93:03)
blast but ice (93:01 - 93:05)
there's the one pokemon i could think of (93:03 - 93:08)
maybe having loaded dice would be zarina (93:05 - 93:11)
um because arena runs uh what is it (93:08 - 93:13)
called it's like called like (93:11 - 93:17)
triple ice skates or whatever where (93:13 - 93:19)
it gets it (93:17 - 93:21)
if (93:19 - 93:22)
the first one hits does like 20 damage (93:21 - 93:24)
the second one that hits those 40 and (93:22 - 93:26)
then third one that hits does 80 or (93:24 - 93:29)
something like that and if you (93:26 - 93:32)
if you hit all three um it it's it's a (93:29 - 93:33)
it's a ton of damage but there's like a (93:32 - 93:36)
possibility where you you like miss and (93:33 - 93:37)
then you don't even get the opportunity (93:36 - 93:39)
to do the other two (93:37 - 93:42)
gosh what is that move called (93:39 - 93:42)
it's not trap kick (93:45 - 93:50)
no not dropkick is it triple axel triple (93:47 - 93:52)
axel yeah yeah there it is triple ice (93:50 - 93:55)
skates (93:52 - 93:58)
uh yeah i can't think of like a really (93:55 - 94:01)
trip uh triple axel is probably the one (93:58 - 94:03)
move i think of i can't think of another (94:01 - 94:05)
move that's like rapid (94:03 - 94:09)
like want to hit multiple times (94:05 - 94:09)
but there were there was some items that (94:11 - 94:15)
were introduced in sword and shield that (94:13 - 94:17)
saw little to no competitive play and (94:15 - 94:20)
the one that came to mind is room (94:17 - 94:20)
service (94:20 - 94:21)
yeah (94:20 - 94:23)
uh whereas like if (94:21 - 94:25)
if trick room got activated then room (94:23 - 94:27)
service would kick in and room service (94:25 - 94:30)
would then lower your speed by one stage (94:27 - 94:32)
which is not nearly enough (94:30 - 94:33)
um (94:32 - 94:35)
i think if if room service lowered your (94:33 - 94:38)
your speed by two to three stages it (94:35 - 94:39)
would actually be pretty (94:38 - 94:41)
usable (94:39 - 94:42)
um (94:41 - 94:44)
but like (94:42 - 94:44)
i i don't th that was the one item from (94:44 - 94:49)
sword and shield that i was like oh (94:48 - 94:50)
literally (94:49 - 94:51)
like people people thought it was (94:50 - 94:52)
interesting when it was initially (94:51 - 94:54)
announced but then it really didn't see (94:52 - 94:57)
any any play (94:54 - 94:57)
i thought there was a fourth item but uh (94:57 - 95:03)
my mind is still in london i guess if (95:01 - 95:06)
there is i don't know where it is so (95:03 - 95:09)
yeah they just showed the the ability (95:06 - 95:11)
that it allows you to to shed the tail (95:09 - 95:13)
and then they show the move that does (95:11 - 95:14)
the when you (95:13 - 95:17)
terrastilize the move changes its type (95:14 - 95:20)
to match your terrasta type (95:17 - 95:22)
did we (95:20 - 95:24)
did we last (95:22 - 95:26)
think that this uh (95:24 - 95:28)
what is this what is the (95:26 - 95:29)
cycles are (95:28 - 95:32)
cyclazar yeah do we think that this is (95:29 - 95:35)
related to the legends absolutely (95:32 - 95:37)
i mean can i remind you of love disc and (95:35 - 95:40)
alola mola it's a cousin at least yeah i (95:37 - 95:43)
mean you can they came from different (95:40 - 95:45)
games (95:43 - 95:48)
not in the same game (95:45 - 95:48)
love disc and a little molo were (95:48 - 95:52)
introduced in separate games same like (95:50 - 95:54)
blue flight and tauros (95:52 - 95:56)
different games these are in the exact (95:54 - 95:59)
same game showing you doing the exact (95:56 - 96:02)
same thing writing them on their back (95:59 - 96:05)
like they are putting out the the (96:02 - 96:07)
breadcrumbs (96:05 - 96:07)
uh what about carbink and diance they (96:08 - 96:12)
were the same game (96:10 - 96:14)
and they are really (96:12 - 96:17)
well was listed as a legendary (96:14 - 96:19)
uh (96:17 - 96:21)
yeah yeah exactly when they hit the (96:19 - 96:23)
legendary it wasn't car bank and diancie (96:21 - 96:26)
are related and they are related they (96:23 - 96:27)
are related but they do not evolve into (96:26 - 96:29)
each other but no that is not the (96:27 - 96:33)
question you asked (96:29 - 96:33)
i i sorry i'm my mistake and my question (96:33 - 96:38)
is do we think that the little lizard (96:36 - 96:39)
the cyclists are just going to evolve (96:38 - 96:41)
into these legends (96:39 - 96:43)
i do (96:41 - 96:46)
because again carbink and diane say they (96:43 - 96:49)
are related per pokedex lore right yes (96:46 - 96:51)
that that we know for sure they were (96:49 - 96:53)
both introduced in generation six (96:51 - 96:56)
car bank is just a pokemon that that is (96:53 - 96:58)
there and like also part of the lore is (96:56 - 97:00)
like sabol i likes to eat carbink which (96:58 - 97:02)
i think is great um and then diance is (97:00 - 97:04)
this mythical pokemon that just looks (97:02 - 97:06)
like a big carbink (97:04 - 97:09)
but they do not evolve into each other (97:06 - 97:10)
um (97:09 - 97:12)
so like (97:10 - 97:15)
do do i think that the the dragon with a (97:12 - 97:18)
wheel on his (97:15 - 97:18)
chest happens to look like the (97:19 - 97:23)
legendaries with wheels on their chest (97:21 - 97:25)
yes (97:23 - 97:26)
but i don't want to jump to the (97:25 - 97:28)
conclusion that like oh he has to evolve (97:26 - 97:32)
into that i mean just put just put your (97:28 - 97:34)
backbone on the line what's the worst (97:32 - 97:35)
people gonna come and say oh you were (97:34 - 97:37)
wrong let's rock about a million things (97:35 - 97:40)
i i i have stated my case i think (97:37 - 97:43)
one of the storylines is evolving your (97:40 - 97:46)
little cycle into a big old legendary (97:43 - 97:50)
we're gonna find out (97:46 - 97:50)
is this going to be like (97:50 - 97:56)
everyone in this world has these lizards (97:52 - 97:58)
yeah but yours that's the special one (97:56 - 98:01)
yeah they said that it's a very common (97:58 - 98:06)
household pokemon to have yeah (98:01 - 98:06)
you do the research to go backwards or (98:06 - 98:10)
forwards in time and to find its evolve (98:08 - 98:12)
form and you bring back the super time (98:10 - 98:13)
rock (98:12 - 98:16)
i think it transforms entire i think the (98:13 - 98:18)
story line is (98:16 - 98:19)
like (98:18 - 98:21)
you need to evolve yours into the (98:19 - 98:23)
legendary if that if that's what we're (98:21 - 98:25)
thinking because it looks like you get (98:23 - 98:27)
the legendary very early on (98:25 - 98:29)
that would be a very short story or you (98:27 - 98:31)
evolved yours oh yeah that's very very (98:29 - 98:33)
early on through one of the storylines (98:31 - 98:35)
the first storyline in like 30 minutes (98:33 - 98:37)
because you need to get a first trailer (98:35 - 98:41)
was being misleading (98:37 - 98:41)
do we think that there's a middle stage (98:43 - 98:50)
or is just this lizard go right to uh (98:46 - 98:54)
whatever stage feels very nebby to me (98:50 - 98:55)
yeah but (98:54 - 98:56)
i mean they've done it once why not do (98:55 - 98:57)
it again (98:56 - 99:01)
cosmog cosmo (98:57 - 99:01)
yeah but cosmoam could actually (99:02 - 99:06)
literally be erased it's it's kind of a (99:04 - 99:08)
bad pokemon (99:06 - 99:10)
there's a lot of bad pokemon in the (99:08 - 99:12)
world we don't just wish for the (99:10 - 99:13)
re-raising you're gonna say (99:12 - 99:14)
should be racing you're gonna leave (99:13 - 99:16)
magnemite around (99:14 - 99:19)
no no yeah magnolia is fine no cosmo (99:16 - 99:22)
could just go into lunala or so galileo (99:19 - 99:25)
like cosmo just kind of exists or it (99:22 - 99:28)
could just be the nice pokemon that it (99:25 - 99:31)
is (99:28 - 99:31)
okay so cycle (99:31 - 99:35)
cycles are is dragon normal this is the (99:33 - 99:38)
first dragon normal pokemon (99:35 - 99:40)
because grandpa (99:38 - 99:42)
is normal dragon (99:40 - 99:44)
need to chill (99:42 - 99:47)
you need to chill (99:44 - 99:50)
oh the difference the difference oh the (99:47 - 99:52)
difference is so huge oh i can't even (99:50 - 99:54)
stand it (99:52 - 99:56)
that would be on a bar that would be on (99:54 - 99:59)
a bar quiz a million percent if that's (99:56 - 100:02)
in a bar quiz and they get uppity about (99:59 - 100:06)
it leave that bar quits because they are (100:02 - 100:07)
if they were like (100:06 - 100:10)
name name the dragon normal pokemon and (100:07 - 100:12)
people all wrote down drain foot if (100:10 - 100:14)
you're like no no no drama's normal (100:12 - 100:16)
dragon yeah i would be like (100:14 - 100:19)
okay we're out uh drinks are on you (100:16 - 100:21)
because we are all leaving without (100:19 - 100:24)
paying this check okay so if if cycles (100:21 - 100:26)
are is direct and normal is that then (100:24 - 100:29)
confirming that (100:26 - 100:34)
miradon and coreydon are then dragon (100:29 - 100:37)
not only if they're related but also not (100:34 - 100:39)
necessarily (100:37 - 100:39)
i mean (100:41 - 100:44)
apparently behind saying yes like i (100:42 - 100:46)
think they are dragon slash something (100:44 - 100:47)
but (100:46 - 100:49)
that doesn't mean i'm right they (100:47 - 100:51)
certainly look like dragons (100:49 - 100:54)
they do look like dragons (100:51 - 100:55)
there's a there's this like there's this (100:54 - 100:57)
like not popular pokemon i think his (100:55 - 101:00)
name is charizard also looks like (100:57 - 101:02)
who (101:00 - 101:05)
i've never heard of charizard (101:02 - 101:07)
oh yeah yeah he's he's pretty new (101:05 - 101:09)
also i think there's a couple of dragon (101:07 - 101:11)
type leaders that need that you need to (101:09 - 101:12)
talk to them about their use of (101:11 - 101:14)
charizard then (101:12 - 101:15)
um (101:14 - 101:17)
cycles are shares the category with (101:15 - 101:19)
skadoo and gogoat they're all known as (101:17 - 101:20)
the mount pokemon (101:19 - 101:23)
so does that like confirm that we get to (101:20 - 101:25)
ride go goat (101:23 - 101:26)
yeah (101:25 - 101:30)
wait what becomes the legendary pal (101:26 - 101:30)
pal (101:31 - 101:35)
not to be confused with passio (101:32 - 101:39)
um i would also like to take us back to (101:35 - 101:40)
our (101:39 - 101:44)
conversation um about (101:40 - 101:48)
technically at the bar uh and (101:44 - 101:50)
technically (101:48 - 101:52)
mega charizard x (101:50 - 101:55)
is dragon so therefore (101:52 - 101:57)
charizard is a dragon and it looks like (101:55 - 101:59)
a dragon so you're gonna get all of me (101:57 - 102:01)
about your normal dragon type i'm gonna (101:59 - 102:04)
come back to your little trivia quiz and (102:01 - 102:06)
be like okay if your example's charizard (102:04 - 102:09)
charizard can be a dragon (102:06 - 102:13)
can go there how how do we (102:09 - 102:16)
run a trivia night at a bar and have the (102:13 - 102:18)
most obscure (102:16 - 102:21)
questions to make pokemon fans easy we (102:18 - 102:25)
open up a bar okay (102:21 - 102:27)
we say trivia night friday pokemon (102:25 - 102:30)
themed and they will flock to our doors (102:27 - 102:32)
correct all we need to do is come up (102:30 - 102:37)
with the most poindexter bits of trivia (102:32 - 102:37)
how many pokemon does ash actually (102:38 - 102:44)
evolve (102:41 - 102:44)
uh yeah that's a good one (102:44 - 102:50)
uh no no no technically charizard (102:47 - 102:53)
evolves itself (102:50 - 102:53)
he didn't want that to happen (102:54 - 102:58)
there would have to be something out (102:58 - 103:01)
there in there that pokemon the movie (103:00 - 103:03)
three there's not actually an entei in (103:01 - 103:04)
that movie because it's just an illusion (103:03 - 103:07)
created by (103:04 - 103:10)
it's not actually an entity um (103:07 - 103:12)
and another one has to be what are the (103:10 - 103:14)
three legendary dogs (103:12 - 103:16)
uh (103:14 - 103:19)
zashi and zamasanta eternitus (103:16 - 103:24)
my favorite this is not a dog (103:19 - 103:24)
i wish i was smart enough slash had (103:25 - 103:30)
enough time (103:29 - 103:33)
right there yeah this is true podcast (103:30 - 103:34)
over (103:33 - 103:37)
i i don't know i don't even know if if i (103:34 - 103:39)
had the time and energy and the the (103:37 - 103:42)
editing skills on youtube and maybe this (103:39 - 103:44)
already exists but (103:42 - 103:46)
do you remember the amount of rumors (103:44 - 103:48)
that happened before every pokemon game (103:46 - 103:50)
like when i was in japan and you guys (103:48 - 103:52)
were hosting the the show and you guys (103:50 - 103:54)
talked about armored pokemon for sword (103:52 - 103:56)
and shield oh yeah yeah vaguely like do (103:54 - 103:58)
i remember us having that conversation (103:56 - 103:59)
no did we probably have that (103:58 - 104:01)
conversation sure (103:59 - 104:02)
yeah (104:01 - 104:03)
we were looking at the clouds on the (104:02 - 104:05)
region and like what's in the north and (104:03 - 104:08)
what's at the south yeah yeah and then i (104:05 - 104:11)
remembered like this the cmyk (104:08 - 104:13)
conversation of like how like (104:11 - 104:15)
zamasu (104:13 - 104:18)
is magenta and zashi and cyan and that (104:15 - 104:20)
means there must be a third dog and the (104:18 - 104:22)
third dog must be like yellow because (104:20 - 104:23)
that's the (104:22 - 104:27)
that never happened right it did (104:23 - 104:30)
because bolton is yellow the third (104:27 - 104:32)
legendary dog (104:30 - 104:34)
do not argue this point with me because (104:32 - 104:37)
i have an answer (104:34 - 104:39)
so i i think i think that would be like (104:37 - 104:41)
for me that would be a fun youtube video (104:39 - 104:42)
to watch and i don't think it exists but (104:41 - 104:45)
i would love to watch a video of like (104:42 - 104:48)
all of these (104:45 - 104:48)
these these uh theories that like had (104:48 - 104:54)
you know a lot of basis off of it but (104:52 - 104:56)
then none of them came to fruition when (104:54 - 104:58)
the games actually came out same with (104:56 - 105:00)
like lily supposed to be like nylee go (104:58 - 105:02)
and then that doesn't actually happen (105:00 - 105:04)
and then like (105:02 - 105:06)
remember how like people were pairing (105:04 - 105:07)
the characters of sun and moon with (105:06 - 105:09)
ultra beasts and they were like oh these (105:07 - 105:10)
two (105:09 - 105:11)
have to do with but they really didn't (105:10 - 105:13)
have anything to do with it i mean they (105:11 - 105:16)
did wow yeah like her mom was dressing (105:13 - 105:17)
her mother as an illegal i was stressing (105:16 - 105:19)
her ass not illegal because she was (105:17 - 105:20)
obsessed (105:19 - 105:23)
right but like they weren't (105:20 - 105:25)
like they're they were like theories of (105:23 - 105:27)
i always (105:25 - 105:30)
like if like (105:27 - 105:32)
if you're looking for (105:30 - 105:34)
a website of the many many theories (105:32 - 105:36)
people have gotten wrong about pokemon (105:34 - 105:38)
it is a never-ending series because (105:36 - 105:41)
there are always things people say (105:38 - 105:44)
correct that's why i'm like are we (105:41 - 105:46)
people are so confident that cycles are (105:44 - 105:48)
is (105:46 - 105:50)
going to evolve (105:48 - 105:52)
but also people were so (105:50 - 105:54)
confident that (105:52 - 105:57)
there was going to be a third (105:54 - 106:01)
dog not bolton (105:57 - 106:01)
uh there (106:01 - 106:04)
you can argue that point you're wrong (106:02 - 106:06)
because both side exists and bolton's (106:04 - 106:10)
the best dog here's the thing (106:06 - 106:10)
it is i've always said this it is fun to (106:11 - 106:17)
come up with theories it is (106:14 - 106:20)
but do not temper your (106:17 - 106:22)
do not build your expectation and hype (106:20 - 106:24)
around your favorite theory coming true (106:22 - 106:26)
no i don't i don't want the theory video (106:24 - 106:28)
to exist to prove people wrong i think (106:26 - 106:31)
it's just a fun video to be like oh yeah (106:28 - 106:33)
remember when we all talked about that (106:31 - 106:35)
i know you too well you wanted to sue (106:33 - 106:37)
people i've been in your twitch chat (106:35 - 106:39)
you'd be like i'm pointing you to go to (106:37 - 106:43)
minute 42 of my 18-hour opus about how (106:39 - 106:45)
wrong you are (106:43 - 106:49)
no i i think that's a fun like i i wish (106:45 - 106:52)
i remembered all the theories before x (106:49 - 106:53)
and y but we're getting to a point where (106:52 - 106:55)
i don't really remember them that well (106:53 - 106:58)
no i mean somebody out there and i wish (106:55 - 106:59)
i kind of wish they were documented in (106:58 - 107:00)
some sense (106:59 - 107:02)
somebody out there can go through all (107:00 - 107:03)
the backlog (107:02 - 107:06)
and make a wiki (107:03 - 107:08)
and then we'll we'll base off the wiki (107:06 - 107:10)
so do a bunch of work for free (107:08 - 107:14)
and we'll benefit from it (107:10 - 107:14)
one last question before we finish this (107:14 - 107:18)
show because we got to do our last two (107:16 - 107:20)
segments how was your guys's (107:18 - 107:22)
experience (107:20 - 107:25)
watching this trailer and watching (107:22 - 107:27)
worlds in general (107:25 - 107:30)
from home first not being there (107:27 - 107:32)
like did did it feel eventful (107:30 - 107:35)
even though you weren't there i watched (107:32 - 107:37)
the trailer (107:35 - 107:39)
i agree that that is my statement as (107:37 - 107:42)
well i did not watch worlds (107:39 - 107:44)
at all (107:42 - 107:44)
none percent i did not (107:44 - 107:48)
turn to that twitch (107:46 - 107:50)
they're they're right (107:48 - 107:50)
and making people's dreams and their (107:55 - 108:00)
their limited time availability codes (107:58 - 108:03)
did not entice me i didn't even bother (108:00 - 108:05)
is it because is it a serious question (108:03 - 108:07)
well was it because of time zone stuff (108:05 - 108:11)
no i i i don't watch twitch um (108:07 - 108:14)
youtube as well (108:11 - 108:14)
i mean some of it was time zones right (108:15 - 108:20)
like (108:18 - 108:22)
stuff that happened during the day for (108:20 - 108:24)
them (108:22 - 108:27)
i was either asleep or at work (108:24 - 108:28)
like (108:27 - 108:30)
seven o'clock then when the day was over (108:28 - 108:32)
was two o'clock in the afternoon here (108:30 - 108:35)
and i'm solidly in work (108:32 - 108:36)
um (108:35 - 108:38)
but also (108:36 - 108:41)
like there is a part of me that wants to (108:38 - 108:43)
go back and like (108:41 - 108:46)
sit down and actually analyze what (108:43 - 108:48)
happens in the unite matches to like (108:46 - 108:51)
understand people's choices (108:48 - 108:52)
but (108:51 - 108:54)
another part of me also understands that (108:52 - 108:56)
unless i have four other people that are (108:54 - 108:59)
doing the same thing (108:56 - 109:02)
ultimately those don't serve me because (108:59 - 109:05)
when you are doing solo or duo cue (109:02 - 109:07)
you are developing a separate set of (109:05 - 109:11)
skills then a coordinated team does (109:07 - 109:13)
yeah so ultimately watching those unite (109:11 - 109:15)
matches to see what a team of five does (109:13 - 109:17)
is great but only if i have a team of (109:15 - 109:19)
five because that's the only way that (109:17 - 109:21)
those skills transfer (109:19 - 109:23)
i think i think there's a little bit of (109:21 - 109:26)
that where where like i was watching (109:23 - 109:29)
a cramer ant player and the way they (109:26 - 109:31)
were moving (109:29 - 109:33)
was very different from the way i move (109:31 - 109:35)
and i would be curious to watch that (109:33 - 109:38)
player more because (109:35 - 109:40)
it made me think about like i've never (109:38 - 109:42)
thought about like navigating the map (109:40 - 109:44)
this way i've never thought about like (109:42 - 109:46)
positioning (109:44 - 109:47)
right here (109:46 - 109:49)
so i think i think there is some (109:47 - 109:50)
self-improvement if (109:49 - 109:54)
you can find a person that plays your (109:50 - 109:55)
favorite character (109:54 - 109:58)
and they play it in a way where you (109:55 - 110:00)
right can be like oh i i can i can (109:58 - 110:02)
probably do that yeah i mean it's not to (110:00 - 110:03)
say that there aren't skill transfers (110:02 - 110:07)
right but i mean i will also say this i (110:03 - 110:09)
don't enjoy watching competitive sports (110:07 - 110:12)
i don't enjoy watching (110:09 - 110:15)
a lot of spectator things where it's (110:12 - 110:18)
somebody else doing a lot of skills oh i (110:15 - 110:20)
couldn't look away from the united stuff (110:18 - 110:24)
and it just it doesn't (110:20 - 110:28)
it doesn't draw me in right like i i (110:24 - 110:31)
still watch like we watch reality tv (110:28 - 110:32)
night right like we do things like (110:31 - 110:34)
project runway and we do things but a (110:32 - 110:36)
lot of it is just to see (110:34 - 110:39)
what the finished garment looks like not (110:36 - 110:41)
the process of getting there (110:39 - 110:42)
so (110:41 - 110:45)
i am not a person that finds a lot of (110:42 - 110:48)
enjoyment in watch watching spectator (110:45 - 110:53)
events i just it's not for me um so no i (110:48 - 110:55)
just didn't it didn't really ever occur (110:53 - 110:57)
to me to tune in other than i thought (110:55 - 110:58)
well (110:57 - 111:00)
steve's on and i know it's important to (110:58 - 111:02)
have good numbers so i'm going to put it (111:00 - 111:05)
on the background while i do work or (111:02 - 111:07)
whatever else i'm doing so that so that (111:05 - 111:09)
it's registering like (111:07 - 111:11)
you were the draw there not (111:09 - 111:14)
the event for me (111:11 - 111:14)
i i i one of the things that bummed me (111:18 - 111:23)
out the most about worlds was i was so (111:21 - 111:25)
busy i couldn't like just stop and like (111:23 - 111:27)
watch the matches and i couldn't sit in (111:25 - 111:30)
that theater and like feel that energy (111:27 - 111:32)
that like (111:30 - 111:33)
it's got it's almost like the same (111:32 - 111:35)
energy you would get for like going to a (111:33 - 111:36)
concert or (111:35 - 111:38)
definitely yeah oh yeah (111:36 - 111:40)
um (111:38 - 111:41)
you know like i'm not i'm not a sports (111:40 - 111:43)
person at all but i've been to like (111:41 - 111:44)
baseball games because i've gotten free (111:43 - 111:45)
tickets to baseball games and it's like (111:44 - 111:48)
why would we not go like let's just go (111:45 - 111:50)
and hang out and once we get bored we (111:48 - 111:51)
can leave it was free like it's (111:50 - 111:52)
something to do but like even though i'm (111:51 - 111:54)
not into baseball i can feel the energy (111:52 - 111:56)
of other people getting excited when (111:54 - 111:58)
something happens in baseball which is (111:56 - 111:59)
very rare but when something exciting (111:58 - 112:01)
happens you you feel it (111:59 - 112:04)
and it sucked like part of me was like i (112:01 - 112:06)
love watching these announcements and (112:04 - 112:09)
like this stuff with my audience on (112:06 - 112:10)
twitch (112:09 - 112:12)
and like they they're they're very funny (112:10 - 112:14)
they make me laugh i try to make them (112:12 - 112:16)
laugh like that is an experience that (112:14 - 112:18)
like only happens with live content (112:16 - 112:20)
and then but like part of me is like i'm (112:18 - 112:23)
literally in the room above the stadium (112:20 - 112:24)
where everyone else is sitting and (112:23 - 112:26)
they're like seeing it live and i i (112:24 - 112:28)
could literally walk downstairs and be (112:26 - 112:31)
in that but then i can't do this um (112:28 - 112:32)
but (112:31 - 112:34)
it's like (112:32 - 112:36)
irene sat down in that audience and she (112:34 - 112:38)
was like it was incredible like watching (112:36 - 112:40)
those matches and like hearing the crowd (112:38 - 112:42)
like cheer when like something happened (112:40 - 112:43)
and (112:42 - 112:44)
like (112:43 - 112:47)
for and i i just think of watching (112:44 - 112:49)
competitive stuff like watching the (112:47 - 112:51)
final matches (112:49 - 112:53)
of the vgc (112:51 - 112:56)
was really exhilarating and exciting and (112:53 - 112:59)
like they still have so much work to do (112:56 - 113:01)
with the tcg because the tcg is very (112:59 - 113:02)
like i don't know if it almost feels (113:01 - 113:05)
like golf like like no one's really (113:02 - 113:07)
erupting in cheers when things happen (113:05 - 113:09)
and it's really kind of hard to follow (113:07 - 113:10)
because you never really see their full (113:09 - 113:13)
hand there's a lot of shuffling (113:10 - 113:14)
um (113:13 - 113:16)
and like the cards are really tiny where (113:14 - 113:18)
like when you're watching like two (113:16 - 113:20)
dynamax pokemon it's like very even if (113:18 - 113:21)
you don't know anything about pokemon (113:20 - 113:22)
you're like oh well that was a huge (113:21 - 113:24)
water type move that was like a psychic (113:22 - 113:26)
type move that was a like you can kind (113:24 - 113:29)
of grasp it but with like tcg you're (113:26 - 113:31)
like i'm not really sure what's going on (113:29 - 113:33)
like why what what card was that (113:31 - 113:34)
like (113:33 - 113:36)
but then with with unite (113:34 - 113:38)
in pokken (113:36 - 113:40)
like pokken i think again anyone can (113:38 - 113:42)
watch and see like these two the two (113:40 - 113:44)
pokemon on screen they're fighting each (113:42 - 113:45)
other there's health bars at the top i (113:44 - 113:46)
get it (113:45 - 113:48)
and then like unite was just also (113:46 - 113:51)
exhilarating in the sense of like (113:48 - 113:53)
a team sport of like watching five units (113:51 - 113:55)
move across the map and score goals and (113:53 - 113:57)
stuff (113:55 - 113:58)
and it was a bummer that i didn't get to (113:57 - 114:00)
like watch that in person i do want to (113:58 - 114:01)
go back and watch the unite matches and (114:00 - 114:02)
stuff (114:01 - 114:03)
um (114:02 - 114:06)
but i i think that is one advantage (114:03 - 114:08)
that unite (114:06 - 114:09)
has (114:08 - 114:11)
is like i feel like you don't need to (114:09 - 114:12)
know anything about unite but you still (114:11 - 114:15)
understand that like flow of how the (114:12 - 114:17)
match is going like i i like for a long (114:15 - 114:19)
time like i never understood football i (114:17 - 114:21)
just knew like as once the team gets to (114:19 - 114:23)
the other end they score points like i (114:21 - 114:25)
didn't understand about first downs or (114:23 - 114:26)
like (114:25 - 114:28)
safeties or like why they would do (114:26 - 114:29)
certain plays (114:28 - 114:32)
um and you slowly develop those skills (114:29 - 114:34)
like watching football (114:32 - 114:37)
uh and i think the same for unite but (114:34 - 114:38)
uh (114:37 - 114:39)
yeah i don't i don't see i don't see (114:38 - 114:41)
unite going anywhere as a staple of (114:39 - 114:44)
these these world tournaments (114:41 - 114:46)
i mean i will say this like (114:44 - 114:50)
i have been to baseball games i enjoy (114:46 - 114:52)
being a part of the crowd like that that (114:50 - 114:54)
energy is infectious like if i was at (114:52 - 114:56)
worlds i would have been like yeah i (114:54 - 114:58)
loved being in the crowd (114:56 - 115:00)
but (114:58 - 115:00)
if it was me (115:00 - 115:04)
and there was nobody around me and (115:02 - 115:05)
they're like we're going to give you a (115:04 - 115:07)
private room to come watch these matches (115:05 - 115:10)
i'd be like uh (115:07 - 115:12)
can anybody else come in with me because (115:10 - 115:14)
i want to talk to them about it i'm not (115:12 - 115:16)
these things up here (115:14 - 115:18)
don't interest me like i've been to (115:16 - 115:20)
baseball games i don't care what's (115:18 - 115:22)
happening down there that much (115:20 - 115:24)
i care what (115:22 - 115:26)
the excitement around me more than (115:24 - 115:29)
anything else (115:26 - 115:29)
okay let's do one quick question of the (115:37 - 115:40)
week and then pokemon the week and we'll (115:39 - 115:43)
get out of here what is the question of (115:40 - 115:44)
the week (115:43 - 115:47)
sheesh (115:44 - 115:47)
can't sleep (115:51 - 115:54)
uh this is robert from our youtube hey (116:01 - 116:06)
if you're watching on youtube like (116:04 - 116:08)
comment your question of the week uh hit (116:06 - 116:10)
the little bell button all that stuff (116:08 - 116:13)
um robert says uh (116:10 - 116:16)
do do you have any pokemon memories that (116:13 - 116:18)
turned out to be a mandela effect for (116:16 - 116:19)
example for some reason i remember (116:18 - 116:21)
seeing an episode of ash catching a (116:19 - 116:23)
taurus as a kid even though it never (116:21 - 116:26)
aired in the u.s (116:23 - 116:26)
well apparently i thought there was a (116:27 - 116:31)
fourth item um (116:28 - 116:33)
you just had that (116:31 - 116:35)
um (116:33 - 116:35)
i mean here's the thing (116:36 - 116:41)
there are things that i remember (116:38 - 116:43)
that (116:41 - 116:45)
i carry with me that don't apply so it's (116:43 - 116:47)
kind of that way like i still in the (116:45 - 116:50)
because you needed to be in (116:47 - 116:52)
a (116:50 - 116:55)
pokemon center to transfer (116:52 - 116:58)
into gale of darkness and stuff (116:55 - 117:01)
i have never i still have it in my head (116:58 - 117:04)
that to save my game i have to go to a (117:01 - 117:05)
pokemon center (117:04 - 117:08)
so whenever i'm playing a game i have to (117:05 - 117:10)
even though that doesn't apply anymore (117:08 - 117:12)
it's not a thing anymore (117:10 - 117:15)
i still have to go to a pokemon center (117:12 - 117:18)
and put myself in it and then i feel (117:15 - 117:21)
like i can save the game and shut it off (117:18 - 117:21)
so see that just reminds me of where (117:22 - 117:26)
like the bug in x and y were if you guys (117:24 - 117:27)
saved (117:26 - 117:29)
in was it in a pokemon center or the (117:27 - 117:32)
outside of pokemon outside in lumio city (117:29 - 117:34)
yeah in lumiere it would crash it would (117:32 - 117:39)
there was a small chance it would crash (117:34 - 117:39)
um i so i also say like four years (117:39 - 117:44)
because the (117:42 - 117:46)
power up moves didn't work properly in (117:44 - 117:48)
gen one it took me until gen five to (117:46 - 117:53)
finally believe that sword dance worked (117:48 - 117:53)
uh the thing uh here's the thing i for (117:54 - 117:59)
for i still i i thought this throughout (117:56 - 118:02)
various battles in sword and shield that (117:59 - 118:05)
bug type was weak to ice (118:02 - 118:05)
um (118:05 - 118:08)
and i don't know where i (118:07 - 118:10)
i i don't know where i got that from but (118:08 - 118:12)
i anytime i saw like (118:10 - 118:14)
a a bug i'm like oh yeah i can just ice (118:12 - 118:16)
beam this and then it will be super (118:14 - 118:18)
effective and then it never was (118:16 - 118:22)
like it even says another thing now (118:18 - 118:22)
but yeah bug is not weak to ice but i (118:22 - 118:26)
always thought it was there was also (118:25 - 118:28)
that thing well that was just like that (118:26 - 118:29)
was game freak's fault (118:28 - 118:30)
where (118:29 - 118:33)
uh when you fight brock (118:30 - 118:34)
and you're like oh electric type attacks (118:33 - 118:36)
don't work i also as a kid i thought (118:34 - 118:39)
like oh i can't use electric type moves (118:36 - 118:42)
on rock pokemon (118:39 - 118:42)
but because brock is the rock and ground (118:43 - 118:47)
right i didn't like put two and two (118:46 - 118:48)
together until like gen four or (118:47 - 118:51)
something like that (118:48 - 118:53)
but the for some reason i i always (118:51 - 118:55)
thought that like bug was weak to ice (118:53 - 118:56)
but it's not (118:55 - 118:57)
and i was like maybe in gen one it was (118:56 - 118:59)
weak to ice but no i don't think it was (118:57 - 119:01)
maybe it was i think it was maybe it was (118:59 - 119:03)
there's a lot of things that i remember (119:01 - 119:06)
taking a long time to unlearn (119:03 - 119:06)
anything for you will i can't think of (119:10 - 119:15)
anything no (119:12 - 119:18)
kind of just take the games as they are (119:15 - 119:18)
pokemon of the week (119:20 - 119:24)
all right last week's pokemon was pretty (119:21 - 119:26)
short (119:24 - 119:27)
uh (119:26 - 119:29)
this pokemon who probably was not named (119:27 - 119:32)
for don diego vega will at various times (119:29 - 119:34)
not take damage from psychic type or (119:32 - 119:36)
normal type ghost type and fighting type (119:34 - 119:38)
moves at various times it will take (119:36 - 119:40)
double damage from fighting type bug (119:38 - 119:43)
type and fairy type or dark type moves (119:40 - 119:45)
you can or cannot tell just from looking (119:43 - 119:48)
at it so easy (119:45 - 119:48)
it's i don't know it's chad (119:51 - 119:56)
it's (119:55 - 119:58)
skarupi no you got to get it right steve (119:56 - 120:03)
you got it right i don't know what it is (119:58 - 120:03)
let me let me repeat the last question (120:03 - 120:09)
the last sentence you can or cannot tell (120:05 - 120:11)
just from looking at (120:09 - 120:13)
it can i tell what (120:11 - 120:16)
whether it's going to take damage from (120:13 - 120:19)
the different types of moves (120:16 - 120:19)
what pokemon is able to disguise itself (120:21 - 120:29)
it's zoroark and it has it's either dark (120:25 - 120:31)
type or (120:29 - 120:33)
normal ghost so (120:31 - 120:37)
sicilians are there that's no no one (120:33 - 120:38)
pokedex number (120:37 - 120:42)
one pokemon (120:38 - 120:42)
this is the problem with these forms (120:42 - 120:46)
it's making everything worse (120:44 - 120:50)
and uh it is not zarua because don diego (120:46 - 120:52)
vega was (120:50 - 120:52)
zorro ark (120:53 - 120:57)
no well i mean yes but (120:55 - 121:00)
there's only one zorro on the ark that's (120:57 - 121:02)
why (121:00 - 121:02)
wait is it zoroark (121:03 - 121:08)
yeah it is (121:05 - 121:08)
oh boy (121:10 - 121:13)
off the rails i've ruined everything (121:11 - 121:15)
with the sheesh (121:13 - 121:16)
yeah (121:15 - 121:18)
you really threw me off (121:16 - 121:22)
really hard to recover from that (121:18 - 121:22)
uh no other pokemon have the same type (121:24 - 121:28)
combination as he suing zoroark and its (121:26 - 121:30)
pre-evolution hissuian zoroa (121:28 - 121:34)
um his suing zoroark and zarua are the (121:30 - 121:37)
only pokemon immune to both their types (121:34 - 121:39)
zoroark was first revealed by masuda as (121:37 - 121:42)
a silhouette in february (121:39 - 121:44)
7 2010 (121:42 - 121:47)
uh in the addition of pokemon sunday (121:44 - 121:50)
its full image was revealed march of (121:47 - 121:52)
2010 in an issue of coracor alongside (121:50 - 121:56)
its pre-evolution zarua that was so long (121:52 - 121:58)
ago how is that possible (121:56 - 122:01)
due to its debut before generation five (121:58 - 122:03)
in zoroark masters of evolution it can (122:01 - 122:05)
see it can be seen parallels to lucario (122:03 - 122:07)
which debuted in lucario in the mystery (122:05 - 122:09)
of mew prior to its release of (122:07 - 122:11)
generation four unlike lucario however (122:09 - 122:13)
zoroark was really revealed at the same (122:11 - 122:16)
time as its pre-evolution form (122:13 - 122:18)
and unlike (122:16 - 122:19)
the car they've never pushed it as hard (122:18 - 122:21)
as they did lucario (122:19 - 122:23)
yeah i mean it did have its own whole (122:21 - 122:25)
movie so (122:23 - 122:26)
um (122:25 - 122:28)
though evolving from zarua at level 30 (122:26 - 122:30)
pre-release information from corocoro (122:28 - 122:33)
suggested it would evolve from zarua by (122:30 - 122:34)
a method (122:33 - 122:37)
different from known evolution methods (122:34 - 122:39)
uh what method it might have been is (122:37 - 122:42)
still uh if it was true is still unknown (122:39 - 122:43)
they're just saying that like there was (122:42 - 122:45)
supposed to be maybe a gimmick and that (122:43 - 122:48)
gimmick never happened (122:45 - 122:48)
zoroark and its pre-evolutions are the (122:48 - 122:53)
only non-mythical pokemon to have an (122:50 - 122:56)
event exclusive for a time prior to the (122:53 - 122:59)
release of pokemon black 2 and white 2. (122:56 - 123:01)
that was um wasn't that like where you (122:59 - 123:03)
had to (123:01 - 123:05)
show an npc (123:03 - 123:06)
like (123:05 - 123:07)
celebi (123:06 - 123:08)
no (123:07 - 123:11)
you had to take the three legendary (123:08 - 123:14)
beasts to a certain forest in black and (123:11 - 123:15)
white and when they were there they (123:14 - 123:17)
would run off and then you'd get (123:15 - 123:20)
zoroarch (123:17 - 123:20)
because (123:20 - 123:23)
because the movie was about zoroark (123:21 - 123:26)
imitating the legendary beasts yeah yeah (123:23 - 123:29)
but you would get the legendary beast (123:26 - 123:31)
through that gamestop distribution right (123:29 - 123:32)
yeah right before (123:31 - 123:35)
right right before yeah (123:32 - 123:38)
the black and white came out (123:35 - 123:38)
um all right well yeah there's a little (123:40 - 123:44)
bit more trivia but it's not as exciting (123:42 - 123:46)
as what i read (123:44 - 123:46)
all right this week's pokemon uh as many (123:48 - 123:53)
friends of dorothy know this pokemon has (123:51 - 123:55)
the potential to be received from a (123:53 - 123:58)
pokemon professor in eight different (123:55 - 124:02)
pokemon games while we do not know if it (123:58 - 124:04)
will appear in scarlet and violet we do (124:02 - 124:07)
know that competitively it doesn't care (124:04 - 124:10)
about the covert cloak at all its hidden (124:07 - 124:12)
ability adds 30 percent power to moves (124:10 - 124:14)
that would have an additional effect but (124:12 - 124:17)
in itself remove all (124:14 - 124:19)
in itself removes all the additional (124:17 - 124:23)
effects that was hard to say (124:19 - 124:23)
all right we will be back next week (124:24 - 124:27)
