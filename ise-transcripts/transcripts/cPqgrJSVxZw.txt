[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 260 fourth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I am your host SBJ and with me is Micah hello how this is hello this is a hello the disaster of an episode already give me one second I need to put Logan back in his cage well okay yeah no no Logan this week no will this week no Travis this week we're recording this late on a Sunday I was out I was out town all weekend and I've been sick all week still very sick very ill I want to die I'm in so much pain right now we got good show for you though besides my mouth feeling like somebody punched me in the face 100 times we have Pat bear on this episode so if you are a new listener to the Pokemon podcast welcome Pat was outstanding that interview was last week it should be somewhat in the middle of the show if you're just looking for that interview I would check the go check the description of the episode otherwise it will probably appear right after our new segment otherwise our show is pretty straightforward we got spoke my news we have the interview with Pat Baer and then we're just going to do a couple emails this week and our Pokemon of the week just Mike and I holding it down but I think I think we'll be able to manage as the other hosts disappear I feel myself growing stronger good it's like it can consuming their power it's like that Jet Li movie one I was gonna say it's like persona 5 we just saw that take two personas and merge them into one or the way more relevant comparison what did Jet Li one I don't know that don't know persona is way more relevant than a Jet Li movie from like 2000 ok good good for some reason I went straight to 2000 movies though mm-hmm ok alright I'll just jump into Pokemon news I guess cuz maybe I maybe I'm not getting stronger as the other day it's back up everything worse Kyle knew I apologize welcome it's not it's not usually I'm not usually here first bit of news is grass type Pokemon to be more common in Pokemon go this weekend this news will probably long gone by the time this episode is up but a new promotional event in Pokemon go the grass weekend will occur from May 5th to May 8th 2017 during this event grass type Pokemon will be more common additionally during the event lore modules will last 6 hours instead of 30 minutes I saw more spinarak that's not a grass pokemon this bug I saw sunkern 4 yeah I got I got like 4 Sun currents I'm still no closer to some flora yeah what a weekend what an incredible weekend feel I really feel like Pokemon go is come is making a heavy return yep sarcasm I don't get why they just didn't make that a week yeah why like why three days I don't I don't get it but it's cool that they keep doing stuff I just wish it was longer especially since like alright now it's back to normal for however long it was so understated to that like I but by the time I realized it was a thing it was like oh well the weekends pretty much over yeah yep midnight forum like carnac will be available via Serie code for the American region games from May 15th to June 5th so don't rush out right away these codes will be available at Game Stop stores in the United States it will be distributed to promote gardens gardens rising which is will be released in the United States on May 5th thus like on rock will be level 50 have the ability no guard which is hidden ability it will be holding a life orb and will know the moves Stone Edge fire Fang sucker punch and sword stance get you it Game Stop get yourself Game Stop pre-order some games by some booster packs center scribe do a magazine but still thing yeah what was it called Game Informer Game Informer get your powerup rewards get your deals on used games don't find new games before they don't pick out of that I don't know if you I don't want to get too off-topic because again my my mouth is killing me so I feel like the more I talk the more I just endure this pain but I do have a semi good GameStop story when I worked there for about six months which was probably like 12 hours over the six months because gamestop has the worst powers slash policy of how you work ever there were a lot of people that would get the get the magazine subscription for the discount card cuz don't aren't you if you're like a Gamestop member you get like ten percent off used games or something like that I believe that's the only way you get it is you pay like fifteen bucks or whatever it is yeah you get the card and the magazine yes you get twelve months of the magazine so it I mean if you shop at games up a lot and you only buy used games it does it does pay for itself but there were there would be a lot of customers that wouldn't want the magazine at all and and this was like 2006-2007 so Meg this was before this was kinda before like iPads and stuff this was when magazines were still pretty for elevant but one of the dudes that worked there anytime somebody said they didn't want the magazine the the GameStop system still required an address you still had to send the magazine somewhere so he would just put his own address in so every month he would get like 14 to 15 Game Informer's delivered to his house credible it sounds like the the the worst layer of him yeah the worst one just endless endless supply of Game Informer magazines every month I mean if you had a fireplace you really saving on your heating bill I would assume isn't that like with the ink and everything those that is probably really bad for the environment boy it's a report about feeling that I worked at Gamestop too and it's it's it's bad it's it's not good this is off polygon comp oh c'mon stars rumor fly after new merch seems to drop a hint the Japanese Pokemon Center is adding a new line of merchandise inspired by cosmic one of the starring legendary monsters in Pokemon Sun and Moon the look upon the Stars collection is a perfect fit for any starry-eyed Pokemon but many fans also see it as an obvious nod towards the rumor Pokemon Stars the 3d s's follow-up game Pokemon stars first entered the lexicon in that that's a fancy word Lexington in November right around Sun and moons launch Eurogamer reported that a director's cut of the 3ds game by that name would be heading to the Nintendo switch sometime in 2017 we have neither seen nor heard anything more about the rumor projects since then but fans are taking the series of Pokemon inspired items by the stars as a tall tale sign as it does a joke yeah you're about a lot of star puns in this so far yeah I look forward to the rest of them I believe yeah allegra frank wrote that we've had her on the show she's fantastic eurogamer's Tom Phillips helped leak the spectacle charge lifting an eyebrow at I feel like Pokemon knows what they're doing oh absolutely I say that it's either it's definitely something that they're aware of and whether or not they're actually hinting at like ooh Pokemon stars is coming here's some hints in some wordplay or they're doing it because they know that everybody is expecting stars and it's not going to be stars and they're doing it just to mess with everyone I feel like either is is possible they've messed with us before right I feel like oh we have oh yeah they definitely have because they've showed like sylveon was messing with us that was a new type they purposely teased that without saying anything yeah they know what they're doing the worst company ever I would I would out Japan gets a lot of collections that we don't get so if the looking to the stars connection comes to the US Pokemon Center I would probably give that a little more weight yeah but I wish we'll see this really isn't news kind of hard to report on but I don't know if you saw it mica there was a video slash gift going around of uh uh Pikachu getting like mugged offstage did you see this oh no oh okay excuse me at the Pokemon world festival 2017 in South Korea which happened just a couple days ago there is uh there was a bunch of Pikachu's dancing as Pikachu's do in the in the Asian continents that we don't get blessed with here in the United States so there's a for probably 14 Pikachu's dancing and one of the Pikachu's in the front row starts deflating like its head begins to sink into each other and very quickly five people in what looks to be FBI / Secret Service suits come out and quickly drag the Pikachu away as the other 13 Pikachu continue to dance oh that was real there's no news there it's just that something that happened Japan is very on top of making sure that no one sees a deflating Pikachu yeah I mean III would guess it would be really horrifying for children yeah and also like to point out real quick that you you referred to them as the Asian comments I'm gonna give you pass though cuz you're sick the continent of Asia how's that all the continents of Asia yeah I resumed a drop in the ba it's okay I would assume it so that it it's it doesn't give any children nightmares I haven't seen the image but from the description it sounds like maybe also I mean I would assume it's like the same as like a fashion show right if if somebody falls you you address that situations as quickly as possible yeah yes and they're on top of their Pikachu the fact that they had not like one or two people quickly removed the Pikachu it was like five that's some dedication to the art the sounds hilarious this is from see like the voice creek this is from CNBC halo Pokemon Street Fighter added to the video game Hall of Fame well has a lot of emotions in one sense I didn't know where it was going let's get those three away let's talk about the most part one Donkey Kong welcome to the donkey kong cast finally the love of Pokemon Donkey Kong merged together in one news article Donkey Kong released in 1981 was one of the first games directed and designed by sure Goro Mita Miyamoto who went on creating several iconic video game games at Nintendo such a super mario bro and The Legend of Zelda Donkey Kong was an arcade machine featuring the character jump man as he attempted to rescue his girlfriend Pauline from Donkey Kong a large ape who threw barrels at player jump man began inspiration for Nintendo's iconic mascot Mario who has started 200 video games really alright I could imagine that without da key yeah like Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games without Donkey Kong there would be no Super Mario Brothers a member of world video game Hall of Fame John Paul Dyson says but Donkey Kong is much more than one character it's an overarching narrative of love and it's vibrant graphics brought a game to life that few others could in the early 1980s it captures the hearts of a generation none rest in peace hashtag donkey kong channel was well lived in our slack community shout out to shout out to the donkey kong channel you you'll always be missed we tell stories or if you joined slack you hear stories of the the Mayo War or or the Plus+ de Buck Adam uncle which bunka the bunka would buckle debacle there it is which which happened before and/or after the Mayo War but only recently active slack members will remember the donkey kong channel which is one of the happiest moments of my life it was incredible I vote that it comes back at the first sign of a new Donkey Kong game I agree with that the other news here pokemon red and green the original games first released in Japan in 1996 and later released as Pokemon Red and Blue in North America Europe Australia became a cultural phenomenon as well as several games the Pokemon franchise includes toys a trading card game a long-running television series in several films the game required players to capture train fight monsters with a main objective of collecting 151 unique Pokemon a clever element to the game was that a certain monster certain monsters were exclusive to one version of the game meaning players had to meet in real life to trade their monsters with another or on both versions of a game this continued relevance and popularity of the brand was viable last year with the Pokemon go crazy where players would use their phones to walk around real-life locations in order to find and capture monsters but uh yeah so CNBC a bunch of other sites reported on these games getting entered Donkey Kong halo combat Evolved pokemon red and green Street Fighter 2 it looks like just a couple others so others that have already joined in the past with doom Grand Theft Auto 3 Legend of Zelda Oregon Trail pac-man pong The Sims Sonic the Hedgehog Space Invaders Super Mario Bros Tetris and World of Warcraft all of those before Donkey Kong is depressing yeah that's a real shame the fact that Sonic made it in before halos well at least they're correcting the error of their ways that's right that's true so congrats to those games for being entered from CBS 58 here will Pokemon go Rio Marge Milwaukee there's a video to go along with it but I'll go ahead and read the copy poke bongo is the talk of the world last summer Milwaukee had will and had one of the best places to play Lake Park there have been some changes at Lake Park quote everyone running and laughing and having a great time said Steve black jr. from a once bustling Pokemon go spot in Lake Park quote that experience is so contagious that's like an experience I will never forget end quote Milwaukee's residents black jr. is a big Pokemon guy where do they get this information from we had that guy in the show yeah he's no Pat Baer I gotta tell Tom that he's been hosting a pop Pokemon podcast called it's super effective from the brew city for seven years quote honestly I thought it would be big but I didn't think it would be as big as it became unquote said black jr. I can't wait to so that guy changes his last name it was huge dick the CEO of Nittany antic the developer of Pokemon go said in a speech on February that the game has been downloaded 650 million times it crushed Apple Store records in the first weeks Milwaukee's Lake Park was a primo spot for players that played last summer and fall and it kind of went on there's a video Go Go with it but might you've been to Lake Park we've talked about Lake Park in the past it's oh absolutely still exist can I just I everybody should watch that video because it has one of not because there's someone that we know in it but because it has my favorite Pokemon go Pont of all time when the reporter says will Pokemon stay or will Pokemon go and I lost it and I have a screenshot of the graphic that they made for that and I've been circulating it because I think it's hilarious it was funny cuz so that reporter uh we probably talked for like 30 minutes and they ended up using twenty seconds of my audio which that's like classic news reporting right but apparently he said if like the spot got traction on TV they'd cut into a longer segment I don't know either Pokemon go is still a hot topic in Milwaukee or or News has been that slow that they had to come out and find me to report on something but I think it makes sense right now because of its on the cusp of summer games becoming it's the things that were popular last summer becoming relevant again as we get closer to summer yeah I guess that makes sense probably like the same same thing if if its nearing Christmas what toys are you gonna report on so like park I don't know if we talked about this life last week but when I was there there's the waterfall area which we talked about before the big thing there was there was three spots you people would just sit by the waterfall get all three put their lers down and then the the big debunk debunk ille de bazan de bungles the big dip uncle was that removed one of the spots so when I was there with the CBS people the spot was back and so we talked we talked about how like the polka stops now close at like 9 or 10 p.m. it would be really great if Niantic was just slowly adding just returning them and assuming that like the old out-of-touch people who were in charge of passing that law to get them removed in the first place just assuming that they're not paying attention and they're not so they're just returning them one by one I'm assuming that's not the case but well I mean like what if they did remove them back I don't think it's possible for a Pokemon go to be as big as it was last year so I don't know if they would actually notice yeah that's true I'm sure there's some cranky old dude who's like walking through the park once a week going well how many stops are here got to make sure I'm sure there's not if there's somebody Milwaukee that cares that much I would be I would want to interview that person I have very little patience for anything anybody that was involved in that at all I just want to say before you move on I will say I listened to last week's episode and I do agree with you that when it's closed it should be closed like I think that should apply to all parks if you're enforcing that the park is closed you you can't you can't complain about that you can't you can't be upset that you can't be in the park past the time that the park is supposed to be closed to play pokemon go because it's the law just don't do that I don't have my tax dollars paying for a police officer to yell at 21 year olds go home when I think it's a perfect example of like it makes it worse for everybody else when there's a group that's MIT that's just blatantly ignoring the law in that regard and I think that was part of why it got so much heat here maybe I can think it was a dumb response couldn't completely to remove it but I also think that it it was a it made sense that it went in that direction or that it got that much attention because there was so much like blatantly ignoring the law at Lake Park yeah we go on but we'll wait for more like Park nice because I'm sure there will be as I'm sure there will be summer approaches us tune in for the Lake Park saga get in here first off shoes a podcast the only podcast out of it every podcast reporting on Lake Park with zero competition I'm sure son is last bit of news here Sun and Moon Guardian risings expansion is now out the second expansion of the latest Pokemon Trading Card Game series Sun and Moon Guardians rising is now available in stores visit a Lola

spend your money I'm curious to see if if the tapu's are gonna be like I didn't I haven't looked at the cards but if they're gonna like dominate competitive the way they have in the games I'm sure one or two well I'm out of the loop right now but it's pretty much they make they make one of those featured Legendary's really really good weather I don't know but there are always cards that there are always Pokemon that they always make good like dark cry is always good Mewtwo is always good Mew is almost always good usually like the Charizard line or the squirtle line I know I said Charizard and squirtle those are the defining Pokemon in his line those line the ones on the box yeah the rather than one squirty okay usually like a grass line is usually always bad I don't know there's a lot of like smeargle is always good it always like seems like smeargle is good so they're Pokemon that that they really like to push in card form so I would be curious if there are any returners where it's like Oh Garbo again probably going to be good because garburator is usually pretty okay I like smeargle Springer goes almost always always good but I also don't play the TCG's so what we'll do now is we'll take a quick break and when we come back we're going to do our interview with pat bear probably our most Pokemon heavy interview that we've done in a while Pat talks about both Pokemon go poke and both Pokemon Sun and Moon so lots of new thoughts and opinions there and then when we come back we'll just we're just going to do like two or three emails and then we'll do our Pokemon of the week so we will be right back I've done a bug dance a Big Damn dance I've done a Sun Dance a Big Damn dance I've done a Sun Dance a Big Damn dance abundant buttons I've done another dance David's up done bud Damien's I'm done abundant Sun [Music] [Applause] damn it I've done a good film it is abundant Sutton's [Music] done plan [Music] and we are back from our break with our guests our guests II I have mr. Pat bear from are you are you in the bear cave right now uh yeah I'm here in the bear cave there is a microphone and a camera somewhere so we are live from the bear cave awesome that's great to hear you said you were a comedian so is that I want to know a little bit just about you outside of of packs and everything is that your your full-time job is that just the thing you do on the side I know yeah well so my full-time job is I work at I work in perform at The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York I've been performing here for 16 years and working here for 15 I started in the intern program became a tech person and now I'm the head tech of both of our New York venues and I my day-to-day is of being in charge of all the other tech people and then at night I am running lights and sound for shows and that's kind of my day job and then I auditioned for things look for me in Episode one of season three of difficult people that's coming out in on Hulu this year I do a little bit acting not a lot but a little bit and then I do comedy shows at night when I'm not protecting one of the shows that I used to do at UCB is actually the show that I do at pax called form foring it is a comedy panel show that looks at the best parts of the Internet and that's a show that I developed to be done onstage at UCB and then realized oh this is a show that works for anybody I could do this anywhere and pax felt like a good fit for that Pat I've been a a fan of yours for a long time I actually discovered you at PAX yeah mostly through the Giant Bomb guys since you seem to have them incorporated with your stuff yeah I'm a comedian in New York because I work at The Upright Citizens Brigade theater I've been able to kind of mash my comedy life with my video game love life like I'm just a fan of video games and also a fan of people that talk about them and so I became friends with a lot of the Harmonix social media people because they would come to New York and they would come see shows and then I had become friends with some of the Giant Bomb folks and when it came time to start doing panels at PAX it was a natural thing to be like oh well let me invite Ryan Davis to be on my panel because he's very funny and also he has a lot of Twitter followers so people will come to my panel if he tweets about it and then when it was time for legal fields which is what the bear cave references arrant rights and Eric Pope of formerly of Harmonix had decided they were going to do this big wrestling video game panel and I'm a huge wrestling fan and also a performer and someone that's good at producing things so I volunteered to kind of help out with that and now Aaron Aaron still does the brunt of the work but I'm definitely there to help him 2 to 3 times a year with what is up too much work for a panel and it's I appreciate cuz here's the thing so people didn't urban impacts but they've been to conventions they know there's a couple different kinds of panels right there's a informative panels on a very important topic that people are really interested in getting to like how to get into games industry where are we headed and stuff like that or how to speak to this kind of character how to make an RPG and then there's also like here's some people doing a thing we make fun of this thing but no one does it on the scale of league of heals the idea of getting upwards of 30 people together to play an old old video game and have personas and costumes and characters and a five-person camera crew and livestreams and it's just it's really excessive but uh still some people's favorite thing at PAX and that makes me very happy to hear that's awesome I do want to get to that a little bit more yes but let let's back up let's back up a bit this come on podcast right so we should probably talk about Pokemon how did you get into Pokemon where was the discovery of the franchise for you after me it started with the you know cartoon I've been a gamer for a long time but I was never really a portable gamer I was more of a console at home gamer so I I never had an original Gameboy uh I think my first game boy was a gameboy advance so I yeah I never had a gameboy or game break color it just never appealed to me oh yeah I had consoles on a TV so I always just played that so I would get like occasionally I would rent like a Pokemon game that was for the home system that I didn't quite understand like I remember the GameCube games were really weird in a way that I liked yeah but like their Pokemon I don't know there was like dark evil versions of Pokemon or something I think that was Gale of Darkness was the GameCube game yeah there was and I remember liking that but my friends were really into it so when I had a Game Boy Advance I got in one a Pokemon game would come out I mean it maybe it was crystal or emerald somebody somebody gemstones in the Pokemon world yeah both games yeah I all I know is it was it was the third and you know the the like they put out the two and then there was like the third one that comes out and it comes out kind of late and yeah combination of the two games I got one of those I'm just kind of on a whim and then I realized oh this is an RPG that system that I really I I like and again so I was like familiar with the Pokemon cartoon and knew about like the different kinds of Pokemon so when it when I realized like oh I actually like this kind of RPG then I kind of got really obsessed with it did that continue whichever series it was crystal emerald did you then continue getting them as it went on I have gotten a Pokemon games ever since uh yeah and so so be one of the things words like Oh new Pokemon is coming out time to upgrade my system I have to get a GS because there's a new Pokemon game coming out or I have to get a 3ds because there's a new Pokemon game and I haven't gotten that yet um I'll do everything I can in the game that that's my main thing is that like I'm a completionist so I still haven't finished my pokedex for son but I have like a lot of Pokemon and I'm like trading with people for moon and I I'm getting ready to do my trades just a trade back so that they will I'll get some evolutions out of trades and I just like that like oh I'm getting a lot I'm leveling up and and power leveling to power evolve some Pokemon and like I kind of get into that like because I don't love battle tree I don't really love like that kind of game plus yes I should describe my day so my day has a chunk of it dedicated to Pokemon which is a weird thing to say but I think once I explain it your listeners and you'll see you'll understand what I'm talking about um sure sure so I live in New York City and I have a commute that involves both walking and the subway so I walk for a couple minutes get on the subway ride that for like 10 to 15 minutes and then I walk for about 15 to 20 minutes to my job and that's a 5 days a week I do that the subway ride is Pokemon Sun is out and I'm on an island you know with my level 97 Pokemon just beating Pokemon up and then my party is just all Pokemon that are like level 3 to whatever and I'm trying to level them up because I gotta get vanillish so I got a power level it that way and that's that and then when I get off the subway and then it's a 15 to 20 minute walk to work so then I open up Pokemon go and the nice thing about living in New York is there are a lot of polka stops because it's a very populated city yep on my walk from 14th Street to 3rd Street along Avenue a I'm collecting all kinds of stuff I'm getting Pokemon I'm all my eggs are getting closer to hatching I'll collect a few things and my buddies walk in so I'm getting some some candy that way and then I go to work and then I finish work and then I'll do basically the same thing and reverse on the way back you've got a system so it's a system it's a time killer and then I still I'll still like crack open like while I'm not killing time somewhere I'll crack open my 3s and like I don't know do some wonder trading or go to the pail ago and and you know see if there's any Pokemon they want to come be my friends so I can trade them away or whatever or like I've got a little time let me open up Pokemon go and and evolve some Pokemon and let me see what candies I need and should I switch out my buddy but like polka instead of like listening to audiobooks Pokemon is kind of like my commute activity totally that totally makes sense if I if I was to take public transportation that would probably be able to fit more Pokemon in my life but my commute is thirty two minute car ride that yeah I'm driving to and from work so it doesn't really work like that doesn't work like that no yeah so it's beneficial for me it's a thing we're like Pokemon go when it first came out I was like going to neighborhoods I don't normally go to because you'd be like well I hear their charm Anders over there and for whatever reason there's very few Charmander in a fire pokemon are kind of not in New York so it was like okay I got to go there and now it's just like well I'm walking in a park let me take out my phone turn on Pokemon go put in my pocket like I I'm not obsessed with can't catching them all but I'm uh I still would like to sure like I still don't have like all the dragon Pokemon and I don't have like you know there's a bunch of the evolved starters in this kid you know they released more Pokemon as you know I haven't gotten all of them but like I still like doing it it's still like gamifying walking and working out a little bit yeah which which I like I'm into I like that for somebody who who does both Pokemon go and the main series games and I feel like they've been out long enough where some people just kind of gravitate towards one is is there one that you prefer or are so I think that they they serve different purposes and they hit different parts of my brain Pokemon go is I would call Pokemon go a card collecting game more than a Pokemon game right it's just a themed Pokemon game our themed game that happens the theme is collect Pokemon but it could be almost anything like the game that it's based on which I can't remember the name of but it was a Google angrist and so yeah ingress didn't appeal to me because I don't care about taking over bases in a cyberpunk future like that's not a genre that I'm super into and I'm people are and that's awesome so I know a lot of people were really into ingress who aren't into Pokemon go but for me the idea of like there's a Pokemon gym right near my work and they're a friend of mine a co-worker still plays and so and once awhile will be like okay there it's at level seven let's let's take over that gym oh we can do it and like that's appealing to me as a Pokemon fan for for many years like walking around in the city and being like oh oh cool oh there's oh oh wow uh yeah I just got a sand slash awesome like that's fun for me in that but it's not obviously it's not a Pokemon Pokemon game you know and son one of the reasons I really like son is because it's trying to be a different Pokemon game it's not I'm sure this is well-worn territory but like they changed it up yeah they made it different you know you're you're you're sort of fighting an evil corporation but it's not a team skull isn't your like main enemy they're just they're kind of like yeah the idea of of beating that you know the this like instead of gems having it be like islands and challenges and and having to do memorization and I don't know I think the characters are more fun and the stories are interesting the idea of the idea of changing Pokemon types you know like oh you see a Persian you know what a Persian is oh nope not in this game you have to remember it you know it's a different type of Pokemon than it was in last one oh no that science slash is an ice type now it's not a ground type and like it's nothing major it doesn't really change the game but it it felt like somebody was like oh we we could just do x2 and y2 or we could do you know white and black or whatever like but what if we tried to make something a little different I like that a lot I do enjoy it so I guess I guess to answer your question I do lean more towards Sun and Moon and more traditional Pokemon games but I'm not opposed to a Pokemon game that's branded that like Pokemon go not you know I still like it I'm at yeah I'm in the same boat I like me both I I just stopped playing Pokemon shuffle which is just a match three game with Pokemon yeah but shuffle so good to shuffle is really good because it's a match three game with Pokemon you know I don't I don't play a lot of the the the dungeon games uh the puzzle dungeon kind of games because like I don't really enjoy that genre um but head Pokemon like pokemon mystery dungeon I bought because I was like well this is kind of it's kind of fun to walk around with a bunch of Pokemon and like do a different type of battling you know it's that it's like that come that that world provides sort of comfort whereas like ingress could fill the void of Pokemon go but like you said you you have no connection to a cyberpunk future yeah I don't I to me it's like Oh taking over a gym that sounds great taking over this deli because that's really all it is is it just oh this is a deli no this is the deli as a Pokemon gym this is a Starbucks where you can get Pokemon poke balls I'm like yep totally into that it's just it it's a little bit of a layer that is familiar uh in the same way that like for some people like they would never touch a Dynasty Warriors game but it's a dynasty Warriors game with Zelda okay and people will buy that because they love Zelda and they're like I can be linked and beat up a bunch of like a tire screen full of dudes okay I'm into it to touch on Pokemon go just because I haven't been I haven't been to New York in the past year or so or do you see other people playing Pokemon go on the street is it still a thing there if you go to parks you're still going to see people playing Pokemon it's not as big as it was obviously when the gen 2 Pokemon came out there was definitely a bump I live near Park in Brooklyn called McCarren Park and there's a baseball fields and tract and some parks that have there's there's one park that has two polka stops and a gym like right in the same spot of the park and so that used to be a place where you'd see because you could get to polka stops without walking anywhere you'd see like 30 people standing around and then a rare Pokemon what happened like I've been in stampedes I've been in the like Oh a rare Pokemon just showed up and then some people start running and then everyone's running and everyone's got their phones out yep and there's a little kid showing you the Pikachu that they caught and these are really proud and you like tear up just a little bit because it's just like this like cool weird experience that you're having about a thing that like is so multi-generational like there's something amazing about seeing like little kids and and their parents are their Guardians like playing the game together and couples walking around and like uh and then like everybody you know because when I first came out everyone had their like USB chargers their phone chargers in their back pocket because there was so much battery yeah and it's not it's not that as much anymore but I still see people like uh the other day I someone gave me a really dirty look um and uh when I was like walking through the city and then I realized oh they thought I was trying to take over their gym like that's what I figure it out because it was a gym right there and I my phone out and I was tapping on it and they recognized that I was trying to take over the gym that they were defending cuz suddenly there was like a yellow team there and I'll show that's hilarious that's really funny yeah so like there's it's still out there but it's it's not the phenomenon it was you're not gonna if you go to a central park on a Sunday you're still going to see people but you're not going to see all the people you would see there there was like a central park entrance kind of by the Apple Store is a that were also a lot of the Care drive horses are there were like three polka stops right there so you would see a bunch of people standing around like and you know and then you get the gyro all the lures are out and people are trying to get you know people are cracking eggs and trying to get as many Pokemon as they can you don't see that as much these days at least in New York there other big cities there might be more of a Pokemon go scene I guess the other gate switching to the other game Pokemon Sun yeah you seemed pretty happy with the the changes they made and it seems like you are still playing it even after even after the Elite Four and and the champion is that correct so there's there's the big thing about the you know the old extra stuff the noob you know new game+ like so I'm attempting to you know fill up my pokedex without having to ask someone to just trade me the things I need I'm trying to do it the right way through wonder training and through leveling and and through a little bit of the GTS store the thing I really like is being able to go back to the Elite Four though ends like it still doesn't make it distill doesn't make sense but it makes more sense in previous games yeah as you know obviously previous games you win you beat the Elite Four you beat the champion you're the new champion everything's great you go back to lead for it's as if you never went there and the champion still the old champion and you beat them again and like that's fine except now I really prefer the idea that when you go back to the Elite Four they're like oh yeah well one day I'm going to be in that spot champ and then you go and you go sit back to the champion and then you almost immediately someone has beat the Elite Four and is now trying to challenge you and you have to beat them to keep your spot I you know they never really talked about it in the Pokemon anime but I don't feel like the champion every time the champion wants to go hang out in their area they have to be do it for every time I feel like you don't have to do that so that's a little weird I like to think that like in the real Pokemon game you're out doing stuff and so it's just like hey so impede the Elite Four are you around and then you come back and then that person's there yeah but I'll and I love the random guys I just want to get to my chair yeah you're like come on come on ten are sorry taunt golf lady I know I could beat all of your Pokemon it's not that we don't have to do this my Pokemon are stronger than the last time we fought but there's something really I think really interesting about like being the champion at being the crowned known champion and then having people from other games show up or the first trainer you thought you see in the game show up or are your friends come like and be like you know even the professor being like well I don't know what if I was champion that'd be fun I did create the Elite Four so we finally add one I think that's a really fun twist on it and it to me it it makes it feel like the game world still goes on instead of being in a frozen state once you you know save the world or the universe or time itself or whatever and then also then go and beat five people I enjoy that it adds a little bit of like of the world doesn't feel as you know and of course there was all the extra stuff that came out at the end like uh catching all the ultra beasts and catching some of the legendary Pokemon and beating all the Eevee trainers and I think I've done I've done everything except like I haven't gotten far enough in the battle tree to like beat red and blue I haven't gotten that far but I've done just about everything else you can do in the game and I wish I don't know I maybe maybe I wish there was more at the end of the game but I still really enjoyed it would that lead into you wanting a third version of the game whether because there's rumors that it might be on switch or whatnot but switch 3ds the new 2d s they announced what whatever would you want to see a third version of this game yeah III I always liked that I think that um having a battleground salic there's certainly battling there but having a like extra or you know if it's the 3d third dimension one or whatever it is like having some extra stuff maybe finally that maybe there's a safari zone on an island that we didn't reach or you know you have to face the couple people like there's a couple people in the game that I wouldn't mind them flushing out a bit you know like I like to know more about that weird painter a person she gives you a crystal and then later you fight her but like there's nothing like what's going on with that like yeah is there something more to Z moves that they can explore yeah I like the the lady we haven't talked about that much on the show but I kind of forgot about her until you brought her up it seemed like they created her and they were going to use her for something and then they ran out of time and then I just just give them the crystal let's move on we don't have time for this yeah and it kind of makes sense that she's so absent-minded and does it and kind of doesn't want to do this job that she's like here you go but but like okay so if they if they made a sequel then you would need new like you would need new challenged people because those people have moved up to being the Elite Four maybe there's some new leaf or maybe there's some we've seen like a couple characters that are related characters are our old characters there's the there's the there's the big mystery with not the non mystery mystery that they just say but don't really talk about the fact that like Oh clearly the dude on this island that seemingly only you know about is like the dad this missing guy yeah like for some reason land on this island lost his memory and then was just like Pokemon could go in caves and collect stuff for you and I just hang out here here's a bunch of beans yeah here's some beans I'm the bean guy and like that's definitely these people's dad and husband and he's just on this island like okay what about that like there's um there are a few things that you could explore and I bet that's going to be in the in the that'll be in the anime right cuz that's where they can do all that stuff yeah yeah like I feel like they I haven't I haven't watched the anime because I've always watched it dubbed so I have to I decide I'm gonna wait I'm not gonna watch the fansubs because that feels weird to me I agree because I'm just so used to it I also like look it's a minor thing I'm not I'm not name-dropping here but it is a fact that like my friend Sarah is a sh when they move when Pokemon moved to Comedy Central I'm sorry Cartoon Network excite when Pokemon moved to Cartoon Network and they redid the cast my friend Sarah became the voice of Ash and it's very weak it's very weird to like know that yeah that's who ashes to me and like even though they this a it from the look at the anime they like D Age gym and like it's weird and almost like a reboot yeah I don't know yeah they have the first two episodes on Disney XD and I watched them and I really liked them I like the new art style I like the animation I liked all the voices yeah but I've heard just from people who have already watched the Japanese stuff that it's more kid-friendly than ever which I thought was a little bit of a bummer again I haven't seen it but but also that makes sense like the thing with the anime was like it got dark like the movies are dark because you can do that in movies but even the anime itself it's like man the world is being threatened again and like I mean we all remember the fact that there are Pokemon that art poke there aren't from this earth that are aliens that tried to hypnotize everyone and take over the world that was like a Pokemon story arc for a long time and then that was unresolved there's like there's a bunch of being like you know freezing time taking over the world destroying the world odd stuff like ashes save the world so many times and but then still can't win like a Pokemon tournament yep and so I like the idea of kind of restarting it for maybe a younger generation because who knows if the last series you know appeal to people and like the other thing is if you kind of start fresh then you don't have to have like we don't need to have Brock come back we don't need to have like friend like Cynthia doesn't have to show up and then you have to be like a kid who just started watching Pokemon last year and you're like who is this I don't know who this is you know yeah like it I appreciate that they're restarting it a bit I don't know if it's going to be for me but I'm interested in it I like the idea of the kind of playing up the school element instead of just being like in the game where you you went to school for like a day and you beat all the kids at that school and then you beat the principal you're done like okay instead of like ash has to go to Pokemon school with his buddy Pikachu I think that's like a cool idea totally it's kind of like the when they rebooted you yo and it was completely different except it was yu-gi-oh but it was like kids in a weird school I can't understand it's like when they reboot Digimon every single season yes except that every Digimon is the same cannon as far as I can tell like I'm not I'm not hey I'm no Digimon expert but I believe that it's that it's just like a new batch of people but all the old people still have Digimon and they're all there and it's all of one universe I'm pretty sure yeah but you could you could start at season three but you're not arguing you could start - and I think Pokemon became in the same way the game is a bit of a behemoth um which is why I appreciate it like we were talking about some of the changes and I didn't mention one of my favorites which is like telling you on screen a move that is not effective are super effective or effective or no effect once you've done it once you've beaten that Pokemon type like that's idiot it's an incredible change just a quality of life because like I don't remember what beats fairy like I do but you don't I mean like when they added Pokemon type you're like and then some Pokemon or now that type but they were normal but oh we didn't realize they were a fairy type this whole time you're like well that means it different move steel was good now okay I guess I have to have a hookup with Pokemon that of Steel types because they're like art steel moves because there are fairies now or whatever it's it's nice to have that thing we're like oh I don't know what kind of Pokemon this is yet I will say this my biggest criticism of Sun and Moon is that there were too many Pokemon that early on that we already had seen for a while there my uh my main team was mostly Pokemon that I've already played another game and I think that's annoying yeah I was it was a thing I was like oh that's a well it's a bird type or a flying type and it also has water moves water flying type so I guess I'm going to use a Pokemon I would use it forever you know mm-hmm my only my only complaint with Sun and Moon was you know it's only a can when you think about it in the future they hold your hand a ton on that first island and I think that's fine especially because they're actually setting up a story too but I always thought like oh I I completed son love son I have a copy of Moon Man I don't want to do that first island again it was great the first time yeah and that's I mean that's any Pokemon game that's any that's any I mean not any game but that's a lot of RPGs like I have a every couple years I revisit I'll either play the original uh persona 4 or I'll play golden on the Vita and man it's ours you play four hours before you get to do anything like it hit it hold your hand and you can't go out at night you can't do it's like so it's so hard to get over that first hump but I love that it's one of my favorite games of all time so it's like worth getting over the hump but it's really annoying I was playing percentage to you know side track of it I smoked playing persona 5 and I'm not really into it and I miss persona 4 so much that I just watching the anime because I was like I I'm not going to go back to PS I'm not gonna play persona 4 again I played it like less than a year ago so I was like I'll watch cup ups of the anime it's like playing the game try to deal with that but yeah with Pokemon it's like yeah I wouldn't mind restarting this game it would probably hold my hand a little bit but it might be nice to start off with some other Pokemon that I didn't play right away that I kind of let sitting around the realize later it's like oh this is kind of cool but I look at my main six right now and some of them are gen1 pokemon or Gentoo pokemon like right i I don't I did not enjoy that or or if it had been those it should have been the hello a little version of the right but not just hey here's a Magnemite you caught a Magnemite and it's electric steel and you don't have either of those so you're gonna use it but it's a Magnemite and that's boring yeah totally agree yeah so I ended up like switching things out and I'm glad I did because like two cannon is one of my favorite new pokemon i love to canada to me you're just so mad he's just edited i love pokemon that changed personality when they evolved i think that's such a fun thing i wish more more of the pokemon did that so to be like i'm a tiny bird i'm a bigger bird I'm a giant toucan with the attitude it's very fun to me and but like I switched to him because I was like even though I didn't have a strong water type at the time I was I was just like I don't want pelipper or whatever like I don't I don't want this Pokemon that I used in other games uh so I kind of fought on that one instance I forced myself and then like I mean there's some Pokemon that like crab brawler I'm gonna put on my team no matter what yeah even though I think that his uh the he's evolved form when he becomes half fighting half ice I don't think it's as good I don't think he looks as cool but crab brawler is like the best the fact that he always has a black eye and that when you like that he like wants to fight and is just like ready to go he's just and we've also obviously already had a punching fighting crab that's literally like lobster crab like that's not something new in Pokemon but he still just got so much personality that I've totally loved him that's awesome yeah and you know one of the things about Sun Moon is the Pokemon have personality because you're going to you know do your they they figured out how to do face touching in a Pokemon game you know you go and take care of them I love that Snorlax is so big you have to scroll up and is like a sleep when you winning kind of wakes up every time like yeah I love the attitude that some of them have I love that like you know it's like it's like oh this Pokemon is kind of like a tea now ah so he's like real like emo looking and then like kind of doesn't love that your take care of him but he does like it's just like little weird touches that I I think are a really fun in that game and and totally like there's always something about Pokemon that were it's like hey why did you spend so much time on this weird thing which I appreciate no yeah I totally agree let's let's switch gears a little bit okay too much Pokemon no I'm just kidding though that was awesome you're going to be at PAX West yes you are going to be doing your your panel four or foreing it mm-hmm yep four oh four yeah as I mentioned is a it's a comedy on purpose funny a comedy panel that looks at the best size of the internet myself and three guests bring videos and photos and just sometimes we talk about like trending things that are like hey this is a cool thing happening in the internet and sometimes it's just like oh thank god someone on YouTube uploaded this old weird instructional video because I would have never seen it but now it's on YouTube and now we can all look at it that kind of stuff I like to say that my show is on purpose positive and I've been doing it paksas for a number of years I ran a Kickstarter which ended on May 6th for to send me out to Seattle so that go the it will be filmed I have a YouTube channel youtube.com slash Pat bear that has a playlist of all the four or four nights that I've done live so people that want to kind of check out what I do can go and watch those live panels there do you notice at those panels that you have a lot of first-timers or do you have you know a bunch of recurring fans or how does that seem to play out so it is a mix um I have some people that just come because the description sounded interesting to them which is great I have some people that come because oh I'd never heard of your thing but you have a guest like I I try to be broadly of people that look at my pain can see a pattern in which that I often almost always have someone from Giant Bomb and one that's because they're good at being presenters there they're used to it I think that some game devs and some game journalists don't have is you know public speaking skills there it's not their Forte so I find the people that are good at that and giantbomb folks are good at that but also have a huge following and that benefits me because if I'm in a room that seats 900 I'm gonna do everything I can to fill those seats but I also try to pick interesting people that maybe maybe you don't necessarily know but do cool interesting things on the internet now or are just funny fun people so I try to mix the the guests up and I do get a lot of people that are like I follow so-and-so on Twitter and they said that they're gonna be at this panel I had and then they like it generally I think I've IV view they were like oh I don't know anything about you but Mary Kish said she was gonna be here so I came and this is the best uh and so uh I didn't and I have friends who are like I go to packs a night this is one of the things I look forward to and I work my schedule around it I do have people that you know they come to PAX East in Boston and they watch the PAX West one on live or they watch my archive of it later and then vice versa I have people that are like oh I can't go to every packed or I can't go to pax anymore but I still watch your panel and that's I send them yeah like I said there are some people that are just like oh I saw that on the schedule and it looked funny and so here I am or you were at the cards and humanity booth and mentioned that you had a panel or I go i watch league of heals the wrestling show and I I guess some of the people are also on your thing so yeah I'm going to that it's nice when I only did I've done two of the three times that pack South has happened in San Antonio I've gone I didn't go this past year 2017 but I went 15 and 16 and that audience is mostly people who've never been to a pax before because they most of that audience is people that flew in from other parts of Texas because text is so stupid thing so big that it's a convention for them and it's their convention and so I had a bunch people they were just like the first year there was only two rooms added panels so my panel was on Friday at one o'clock and was like a thousand people came and I know that are you sure that that that was me because I was like there's I think that's how I discovered you to because I've you had a Giant Bomb guy it was there was really no panels it was one of the first packs I've ever been to I was like I got an hour to kill let's see this and yeah it was it was super entertaining that one I'm proud of that one that one was really fun my second pax south was good too and that one you know a little bigger a bigger venue our audience the audience had grown a little bit but yeah that first pack south people were just looking for something great and I was happy to give them something and I was so so thrilled that Jeff Gerstmann could be there of Giant Bomb um because I was like Jeff is a great panelist I just had him this year in Boston again he's one of my favorite guests to have but I also was like that's gonna be real good because people will come to see him because if they haven't been to Boston or Seattle they probably haven't seen him do a thing so I'm a producer by Nature and a performer but I you know I try to pick people that I think will be interesting I also it's very small but if you watch like a bunch of my panels you'll see four white dudes in their 20s and 30s and then I slowly branch out as I've met more cool awesome people they happen to be uh not just like me and that has been a nice thing to be able to do that and sometimes those people are very well known in the industry Austin Walker's done my panel a couple times and people will know him very well but then there's some people that I'm like you don't know how awesome this person is they're like an artist on the internet and they're amazing and you should check them out like I've been able to start doing that because I'm not as worried as I used to be about putting butts in the seats because I've I've now done it for like five years so yeah I feel like it it seems like pax kind of guarantees you in at this point you know there's always the chance that one time they'll be like we don't have room for you um I don't see that necessarily happening I have a good relationship with other people that put together from read that kind of put together the programming Jerry knows my name and my face which is nice to have it's not a garret that's not a guarantee of anything but um put the staff especially it read know me and know that I generate an audience and I do a panel that works pretty well on their twitch stream because it's very visual whereas you know some panels just are people talking and they don't they're not as awesome to be live-streamed but I think my panel works pretty well there for for audiences watching at home and we yeah we have a good relationship and then also like I am NOT a hard person to work with I try not to be anyway because well because of my comedy background because I'm the tech director and a tech person like I know what my show I know what for for any needs and so I am a broken record about that but I also know how to get it done and what I need to do to get it done I don't show up and go hey uh we have a PowerPoint on a USB I'm like here's my laptop here's my backup laptop here's here's it on a USB just in case it's on a Google Drive like because my show is a PowerPoint I have I have it on my phone I have it on my iPad Mini I have my lightning to HDMI adapter I've got a VGA adapter for a laptop like I'm not I might be a weird show to produce at PAX but I'm not I know how to get it done yeah yeah in the same thing with league of fuels our wrestling show which we were doing for a few years now yeah talk about that a little bit I know I know some listeners were all their eyes when they when they hear the word wrestling oh yeah so we're going to talk wrestling on a podcast it's not about wrestling at a K every podcast has a little bit of wrestling talk in it so here's the thing the two things I hear from fans of our panel who come to the panel I hear two things one I love wrestling I'm so glad there's some wrestling here and - I hate wrestling this show is so funny uh it I honestly feel because the so they can see it is there two versions of it because it is that um once a year we play royal rumble mode which is 30 players for at a time and you fight until you get knocked out of the ring and then someone takes over and so we get thirty video game journalists and developers and comedians and musicians that are at PAX together and some come up with characters some are you know wrestling characters some are evil witches and and Steve Kim fob washed on Twitter just played like a eSports Korean version he is Korean so you play like an eSports version of himself that was really funny um some people like have personas and some people are just like hey I'm Chris Kohler from formerly of Wired now Kotaku and I'm playing this game and I'm good at video games like there's that kind of thing and so we kind of created this mythos in the story and then also once a year we do a more of a storytelling show where we play different games and it's more about like trash talking and it's called League of heals because almost everyone is a bad guy because it's more fun it's more fun to be an evil character than it is to be a good guy it's so much so that it's very fun when we have a few people that are like oh no the audience loves you you're too nice you have to be a nice character it's it's very fun with the audiences like know your trash talk is adorable sorry and the one of the reasons I love it is because it's unlike anything else at PAX it's incredibly presentational it's a story it's character work it's a huge cast and another nice thing about League of heels is because it started with a lot of there still are a lot of Giant Bomb people in it so we kind of drew from their audience and then built our own people that love the Harmonix social media crew at the time people that loved different game developers that came in early there were early adopters but then their characters that you don't know like one of our best champions with Samantha Coleman who made centrist she's an independent he just joined up with a company I which name I can't remember where she ended up it might have been an Amazon please don't call me on that but she just got a job she's an independent that some people would never have met but because she became our champion a bunch of people were like oh let me check this out we hear that a lot like oh I never played gang beefs but then one of the guys who made gang B's showed up and he seemed so nice that I'm gonna go play that game or I don't know anything about iron galaxy but Dave Lang seems like a crazy person so let me go play some let me go play divekick because that dude seems crazy and cool and it's been a nice little way for us to take a you don't know Kate Welch but you gotta know Kate Welch because Kate Walsh is awesome and now more people will know Kate Welch because she's doing um she's on the C team for Penny arcade's a D&D game inquisitions Inc they just started like a new livestream of that like a weekly show and Kate is on that and so people are gonna fall in love with how cool and awesome Kate Welch is but also they're people were just like she had a Rocketeer mask so that girl rules you know that kind of thing and then the other people just like yeah I don't care about wrestling but I like seeing John Drake wear a suit made out of money so I'm gonna come to this weird show and the people that love wrestling get to yeah they get their fill they get a little bit of wrestling you know they get to see like z WD performer Xavier woods cut a video promo package for us and so they get to have that and there are old school wrestling references and and in jokes that we kind of pepper in for the die-hard fans and then there's people just like I played a lot of that n64 WrestleMania game so Wrestlemania 2000 for the n64 so it's nice to see that terrible game being played awesome so I'm the I'm the person at least everyone is very self-deprecating about Lea heals we say it's terrible we were like oh I can't believe they keep letting us do that all that stuff I'm the guy that doesn't do that because while there are some parts that drag I honestly feel like it's a very cool weird show and the most unique thing at any pax that you're going to see I think it's a spectacle in a way that outside of the musical acts no one is doing spectacle like you know cards against humanity does pranks and stunts and and and I think that they're they're great at that but their panels are still mostly like hey pitch us cards for our game which is really fun but I think League of keels is the only truly weird unique panel at PAX and so you're gonna be at PAX West with or for in it and family meals Niels is returning League of heals I mean look like I said they can always be like we don't want to do this anymore and when it comes to league of fields they have case we had an incident that we had two years ago we had to clear out a hotel room at PAX so a hotel ballroom FX because of legal fields so there is probably justification for them like we shouldn't do this anymore but also all signs point to they're going to keep letting us do it and I'll have another panel pop possibly another comedy panel that's not for flooring it but is similar in nature that one I don't know if it'll be approved so I'm not talking vocally about it other than they say I submitted another idea for a panel and they might accept it got it cool cool well I only have one more question for you pat okay what is your favorite Pokemon you know I did I did some thinking about this because I thought you might ask you know it's a Pokemon podcast yeah yeah I have I have to UM okay and so my first answer for for years and years and years my favorite Pokemon was maka hito me makuhita um because I like Pokemon that looked like humans he's just a big I I like Pokemon like like Snorlax he's a big normal type that can learn a bunch of different moves like I like a Pokemon that can learn earthquake and surf and it looks like a goofy dummy uh so I love Tim Brown um but I will say that my new favorite Pokemon is actually Snorlax I never gave Snorlax a chance I love Snorlax in the anime and there's just something great and in Sun and Moon Sona Lux help me out in so many jams and also saw relaxants like personalized eat ritzy move is polarizing pancake it's so amazing the end like watch it on youtube if you haven't done it I encourage everyone just the from the idea that it's you're standing on a sleeping Snorlax and then he turns to the camera and his eyes light up and then it's just like and then some relax is just amazing and just like fast and jumping really high and like being incredible and to me that's like my favorite thing about thinking about that pokémon its door locks just like Solex is it lazy Snorlax is saving up its energy when you really need Snorlax to save the day uh and I love that sausage is like yeah I could run and jump around or I could just punch a thing once a day like there's something about so excited and it's similar to why I love makuhita uh is just like this like I like those kind of big Brawley uh goofy Pokemon like that sure no totally totally awesome where can our listeners find you and the cool stuff you do so I'm on Twitter my name is pat bear my last name is spelled ba ER I'm Pat bear on just about everything I'm on YouTube as I said and I have my playlist my 404 playlist uh and yeah twitter.com slash Pat bears easiest way to find me um I am just when this comes out I will have finished with my Kickstarter to send my panel to Seattle and so then I will stop talking about a Kickstarter for awhile and my Twitter account will go back to being other promotion but then also like fun stuff and I hey I have a friend of mine told me the other day he said your Twitter account is like cool stuff you're doing your opinions on things I don't know anything about and retweets that are very funny and I was like okay that's a pretty good summing up I just ranted about the differences between persona 4 the persona 4 golden the anime for no one I don't know if anyone appreciated that but I had some thoughts on how weird the persona 4 golden anime is and my favorite part of the Furby persona for anime there which I'm going to say right now okay I'm going to tell you right now episode 13 of the persona 4 animation is my favorite episode of that series because it is uh Nanako is trying to figure out what her big bro you the main character is has been doing at night and during the day because he's been really busy uh and it's really her discovering that he has social links with all those all those random characters from persona that like don't fight with you like the old lady and the nurse and the kid that you tutor and the kid that you babysit all those people like are interacting with you the main character and Nanako is like discovering it and the other characters are coming like wait does does you have a girlfriend who's this girl like it's an it's hilarious it's like really fun it's like a two-part episode 1314 and it's adorable but it's also like world-building in a way that that anime uh it's very good at and I ranted about that and there's like few people that are like oh that sounds awesome and some people are just like what are you talking about ah so that's my twitter account that's awesome yeah cool well thank you so much Pat for being on alright thank you for having me I hope to see you in Seattle I hope my listeners if they are also in Seattle come out and check out your for flooring it panel because you look great yeah thank you it's really great so when we come back here we're going to do some

interview let's jump over to some emails if you have any emails for us any questions comments concerns you can send that over to s bj @ PK m n CA st.com s bj at pkmn cast dot-com or you can go over to pokemon podcast calm and hit the contact button both will get your emails to me person snail mail and snail mail I should I should try to memorize my P o box I don't have to always have to look it up I could memorize it for you and anytime I'm on I'll shut up shout it out because I'm a huge proponent of snail mail Alex writes in from so Kay in Washington hi s PJ and crew on the last episode 263 you guys talked about what Pokemon game games could do instead of the Elite Four and I've always wanted them to do more like the TV series and do a pokemon tournament of the top 16 or 20 trainers and you would face arrival in the finals but an order but the order of other trainers are random I think it would add a lot more fun and replay value to the game would love to hear your thoughts on this love this show and keep up the good job Alex didn't they do something like that black and white with the with the tournament where they brought back all Gym Leaders and people got excited and then no one cared did they do that I thought was black and white - they did something like champion tournament oh maybe it wasn't like structured like he's talking but it was like something of like in Smash Brothers you sounds read up a tournament earlier yeah and I think it Marty can you do that mark our date actually set up a legit tournament uh well the only way that you can get which it depends which one deluxe I thought no I thought that we you on you could o the we won you yeah the we you one you could set up tournaments and then people could join them once you I guess I don't know advertised it around when I say tournament I mean like a bracket tournament yeah yes like Oh not all people I don't think there was was their bracket stuff in March there's bracket stuff definitely Smash Brothers you're talking to like the least competitive play person on the planet uh I don't know if like a bracket at the end of a Pokemon game would be like that's that sounds cooler than it probably is an execution I think it would be cool to be able to do that for on line play for like play with other people as far as like an NPC are they saying like an NPC bracket that you would do yeah like everyone would be random except for you working your way up the bracket right uh yeah I don't I mean I I could see it being really fun and being something that people really enjoy if it's for multiplayer I don't necessarily know about against NPC's if it would be I do like the concept of a tournament though yeah because that is probably some of the best anime episodes as one Ash's in like a eight episode tournament and so you don't have the standard we have an issue with one Pokemon Team Rocket comes tries to steal Pikachu we solve the issue with the one pokémon ash still refuses to catch the Pokemon because he's a terrible trainer and then the episodes over and then also loses the tournament that he's in yeah yeah yeah cuz it's ash but the tournaments don't have that story they just have usually two to three battles right makes it enjoyable to watch I like the concept Alex I just don't know how you would execute that in a game without it feeling so time wasty I guess I don't know I feel like the Pokemon already is so sluggish in everything it executes yeah I like I even have a hard time doing like battle tower and stuff like that just because I don't know I don't see the personally I don't see the return on it I guess I'm not as interested in what I get in in going through it or completing it or whatever so I I could see other people liking that but me personally it's not what I'm not what I'm into Michelle writes in from West Babylon New York hey guys I just wanted to re-emphasize my appreciation for your podcast as two of the three of regular podcasts have ended with ISE being the only one left I love that I can always count on you guys for an amazing show I wonder what other podcasts threw in the towel secondly I want to add that I continue to love how the podcasts more serious subjects last week Steve shared his point of view as a part of an interracial couple and it was so amazing to hear that I am NOT alone my husband is Puerto Rican and we certainly get treated weird even though we live in New York when we show up for dinner reservations for example I definitely get weird looks I the whitest girl ever say my last name is chant Sanchez then continue to get weird looks when my husband comes in from the front parking the car and he's the only Latino in the building besides the Busboys what is sad to me as well is that my husband actually gets treated better by his Latino friends and families as well by his truck as well as by strangers because he is being seen as successful for marrying a white girl but shouldn't be like that in the end we all handle it the same way Steven the same way as Steve and Irene just by laughing it off and finding it funny thank you so much for all you do and please for the love of vanilluxe and all that is frosty please please please don't ever end the podcast Michelle thanks that's really sweet that means a lot wish I had like an incident that that happened to me over the weekend that that I could tell but now just same boring just a boring interracial couple just like just like all couples yeah sometimes things happens though just boring well that's the ayat that's really sweet yeah I appreciate it this is from Toby just wanted to thank everyone for making the podcast a great show this is the best source of Pokemon news and I just love it overall thanks for a great year of Pokemon news and hopefully more to come I started listening about last fab February from Toby thanks man hey welcome this is from Dustin from Flagstaff Arizona a Lola I just had a couple of questions for all of you first off Steve has talked about introducing a sound type for several times of the show so I was wondering which types would be super effective against sound type which would not be very effective secondly I want to tell you guys my all-time favorite Pokemon team and what I would like to hear which of them you like the best my favorite Pokemon is veteran and the other five that I would have on a dream team would be be drill shackle Esper vespiqueen and heat more which of these six type of pokemon do you prefer thanks for your show Dustin sounds like Dustin love some bug Pokemon oh yeah man yeah here's some good choices I really like mega Beedrill but I also like vespiqueen mostly because I like cumbia hot yeah I like combi and vespiqueen just in the concept of the Pokemon heat Mars pretty cool just because heat more has that like ultimate rivalry with the Durant which I find I do love that as well it's like a weird caillou relationship ah but yeah all this although sound great I probably go with Beedrill I mean I like that vespiqueen quite a bit is it queen or court vespiquen isn't it like is it clean with 1e so that's probably skewed in some way vespiquen I don't know did we talk about we can poke my name's do you know Bidoof or Bidoof is what what what I always hear yes but it's actually Bidoof is it really that is what the anime has told me and my whole life is a lie but it makes sense if you think about it because Bidoof is a beaver oh man so why isn't it like be Edie oh oh f I guess that would be like not you've it's funny because when I go to like live shows and stuff and I and probably when people listen to this and I say Pokemon names wrong and they probably are very upset in their car that I'm pronouncing it wrong I have never ever heard a person say Bidoof nope neither and now I am I'm laying it out here I am correct like this is the name and there's going to be those listeners are gonna be like no way I'm just gonna call it Bidoof because that's what I've always called it and that's fine but if you're the ever the listener that is then correcting me when I say you know sunflora now I can't say something wrong it's pretty easy what's it the name I mess up I can best vespiquen vespiquen I don't know what that is it could be vespiqueen it could be a good one a good one that I know Arceus is what I hear a lot but it's not actually Arceus right ah that I know for sure because of the the anime and then the other one that I hear people say wrong Oh sighs are some people say scissor I'm not sure what that one is yet sighs or scissor I don't know I don't know which one it is I've always said size or and I've always said uh Arceus I know that it's wrong I just it's so engrained at this point that it's hard for me to remember to to not say it that way another one is ricotta because requires actual pronunciation is do you know what it is uh no I don't I thought it was request no its Rayquaza requisite yep I'm out of here so at the end of the day I really don't care how people pronounce Pokemon names because if you say Rayquaza or request or size or scissor I still know exactly what Pokemon you're talking about I just think it's like I think it's kind of petty when people correct on that stuff yeah of like oh uh clearly you know past the first 150 Pokemon tuned over a quaza but you said it wrong it's like chill out like we both like Pokemon it's alright just relax so just dumb character names relax buster but it is B dude uh I'm curious why they have never included in the pokedex entries pronunciations why have they never done that I would assume cuz audio files take up way more no no no no not like an audio file like a like a like for it like an enunciation break phonetic that's an kinetics like breakdown of it why don't they include that in the pokedex entry they know that everybody's saying I'm wrong maybe that's why they don't because they like they enjoy listening to everybody say them wrong yeah I mean we've had two or three voice actors from the anime on the show before and every time I've asked them I've asked them all the same question it's how accurate are you guys pronouncing the names and they have always said like they take they make sure that we are saying the right name before we you know do the episode whether that is you know let's say that are introducing I don't know Metapod this episode make sure that they say it the way that Pokemon company wants it to be said if you're listening to this podcast and you are in charge of naming the Pokemon through a through localization I have a lot of questions I want to know more about this I need to understand this process better going back to the the first question what would sound type be strong and weak against I don't know I guess I never really thought that far I thought maybe sound type would be weak to steal alright yeah I can see that steel boar and like a long against steel if is causing separation so steel is only strong against ice and rock and ferry so for steel to have another strength I think you're on to something alright now what about weakness though I would probably say that sound would be weak against electric or weight because the electric could weak to steal but strong to electric know also weak to electric Oh also weak to electric yeah I feel like you have to have two weaknesses okay so electric and steel would be its weakness what's the reasoning for electric because like electric could distort the sound waves is of too much electricity okay or speed maybe speed of light versus speed of sound that's true ah here you put a lot of thought of it I mean we're designing a new type here essentially I would say that sound would probably be strong against bug ear type because you can buy those like sound things to put in your basement to keep bugs out or other critters ooh excuse me like that thing yeah like there are these things you can plug in for I'm sure there's disposable ones that when you plug it in it emits this low-frequency noise that keeps like bugs or rodents away from your basement that's interesting I am probably strong against like flying as well I don't know how unbalanced for balance this is but or maybe flying would be strong and sound yeah this the likes weak to sound is where I'm I'm having issues well if if our listeners have any thoughts please email us well we'll share those probably much better thoughts than we've had in the last well we got two minutes I mean I read that email initially and I thought about it for a second and then I was like I'll think about it again when the podcast comes now that panned up and here we are let's jump over to our pokemon of the week based off of one of Pat's favorite Pokemon we're going to do Snorlax this week Snorlax fun fact eighty eighty seven point five percent male twelve point five percent female one of those nine fifty fifty pokemons that exist in the Pokemon universe get a move set here from Kevin and Brandon in slack looks like they work together a little bit so if you're running a competitive Snorlax in the current format you're going to want to do brave nature with six hundred move not 668 V's in HP 196 and attack 244 in defense the ability gluttony holding a leper a lap a berry a leper lappa lapa Lepanto berry they exit you got it if possible you want the zero IVs and speed with the move set curse return recycle and high horse power that's actually my motto in life first you curse then you return then you recycle and then you just run high horse power all the way home Kevin writes the Snorlax uses curse to build up its attack and defense a heals up with the the la Papa berry and then can reuse it with recycle lapak lapak a berry is great because it restores 50 percent of health while the wreck with the recommended nature gluttony pairs with the with it because Nora likes eats it at 50% health instead of the normal 25% Oh eats it at 50% instead of 25% left return it is your stab move same a type attack bonus high horse powers will get your coverage for partners you're going to want to use this in a trick room team obviously Snorlax being as slow as it is new and like a fine wine you're going to want a person relax with mimic you for type cut yes porygon to is also a good Pokemon pair that with for again type coverage mothers just mimic you so there you go move set their little competitiveness in your life if you get a shiny Snorlax it is a royal blue instead of that greenish blue that you normally get any pokemon stadium series Snorlax opens their eyes when they faint in Pokemon snap Snorlax stands up and dances to them to music when the poké flute is used and HeartGold and SoulSilver if the player interacts with snarl interacts with Snorlax that is walking with them at Mount Silver the the message quote Snorlax is feeling very eager and quote will appear this is due to read who is also at mount silver also or owning a Snorlax while the player arm out Silver's unique message will also appear if the player interacts while walking with a Pikachu or a Charizard Sonic's has the highest base stat total of all pokémon that can hatch from an egg pokemon gold and silver Snorlax is programmed to be able to learn charm through breeding but no other Pokemon in the monster group can legitimately learn it to pass it down as an egg move in those games in generation 3 Snorlax inherit the move from Bulbasaur by chain breeding I'm finally Snorlax is the heaviest normal Pokemon did you say in Stadium it opens its eyes when it gets knocked out yes and then it also says in later 3d 3d games so I don't know if that applies to Sun and Moon I can't recall I don't think I've ever seen that animation I'm sure I've knocked out a snarl accident Sun and Moon but I don't remember it there had to I need to look into this this is blowing my mind right now some investigations a little bit
