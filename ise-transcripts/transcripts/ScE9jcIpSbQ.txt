[Music] (0:01 - 0:28)

episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:28 - 0:33)
super effective I'm your host SBJ (0:30 - 0:37)
episode 405 feel like I did this in the (0:33 - 0:38)
wrong order (0:37 - 0:45)
Greg Here I am Here I I have your back (0:38 - 0:48)
whatever episode this is okay well also (0:45 - 0:55)
here and I will always love you I knew (0:48 - 1:03)
that was coming much music on this show (0:55 - 1:06)
there's not there's not enough music on (1:03 - 1:09)
this show I'm gonna do the Dolly Parton (1:06 - 1:10)
version and Greg is gonna do the Whitney (1:09 - 1:18)
Houston version oh yeah so we've been (1:10 - 1:20)
trying to aim for these shows to be (1:18 - 1:22)
closer to an hour because of how many (1:20 - 1:24)
people are working at home and not (1:22 - 1:26)
commuting myself included my podcast (1:24 - 1:28)
listening has gone dramatically down I (1:26 - 1:30)
think I said this last week but I think (1:28 - 1:32)
I cut it so hopefully this doesn't get (1:30 - 1:33)
cut so you probably noticed that well (1:32 - 1:36)
quit cutting it you have control you're (1:33 - 1:39)
actually like some third it's like some (1:36 - 1:40)
third party when I end of the podcast (1:39 - 1:44)
I'm mostly cutting myself because you (1:40 - 1:47)
cut out the Minnesota weather report on (1:44 - 1:51)
the last one that I listened to so I did (1:47 - 1:54)
I did hey you need that first like five (1:51 - 1:55)
minutes to be strong otherwise people (1:54 - 1:57)
are gonna turn it off this is the strong (1:55 - 2:00)
intro we're offering if we ever had a (1:57 - 2:03)
first five minutes that are strong I was (2:00 - 2:04)
going to say what's not strong about our (2:03 - 2:07)
proud Minnesota folk breathing before (2:04 - 2:09)
winters you start the show every time (2:07 - 2:12)
that is starting on our weakest foot oh (2:09 - 2:13)
wow oh gosh (2:12 - 2:16)
so we have a show for you guys that and (2:13 - 2:18)
that's not so much sort of Shield stuff (2:16 - 2:20)
we have a lot of Pokemon go stuff (2:18 - 2:23)
they're really trying to make it so you (2:20 - 2:26)
can play at home and have a good time (2:23 - 2:28)
we're gonna talk about this I know some (2:26 - 2:29)
people don't care about Pokemon go I (2:28 - 2:30)
know some of you guys do care about (2:29 - 2:33)
Pokemon go it is what it is there's a (2:30 - 2:35)
lot that they're trying actively to do (2:33 - 2:38)
and I feel like we need to talk about (2:35 - 2:39)
that there's some new shirts (2:38 - 2:41)
from original stitch the johto stuff (2:39 - 2:42)
came out we're gonna talk about that and (2:41 - 2:45)
there's a new masters updates probably (2:42 - 2:48)
another two or three things that I can't (2:45 - 2:49)
figure out what we're talking about in (2:48 - 2:50)
what order but that's why we have a (2:49 - 2:55)
break in the show bag you can talk about (2:50 - 2:57)
everything we were supposed to that (2:55 - 3:00)
being said let's talk about the original (2:57 - 3:02)
stitch shirts we've talked about them (3:00 - 3:05)
before we've covered the entire journey (3:02 - 3:08)
of those being japanese-only shirts then (3:05 - 3:10)
during that announcement were they it (3:08 - 3:12)
was I'm pretty sure was the announcement (3:10 - 3:14)
where they said like let's go Pikachu is (3:12 - 3:16)
coming out another game is gonna come (3:14 - 3:17)
out after it we don't have a name for it (3:16 - 3:20)
there's a new Pokemon Center opening up (3:17 - 3:22)
in Shibuya and original shirts will be (3:20 - 3:25)
available in the UK Canada in the US (3:22 - 3:27)
sometime later this year I think that (3:25 - 3:29)
was all the same announcement yeah I (3:27 - 3:32)
think so the original shirts came and (3:29 - 3:35)
kind of went does it I'm sure people did (3:32 - 3:38)
stock up on them they did add them to (3:35 - 3:40)
the added four of the designs - Pokemon (3:38 - 3:42)
go like eight months ago and then they (3:40 - 3:45)
just added another four designs like a (3:42 - 3:48)
month ago which we covered but the Jojo (3:45 - 3:50)
stuff is out it goes from Chikorita is (3:48 - 3:52)
that the first one yes (3:50 - 3:58)
chikorita - oh no Celebi yet and they (3:52 - 4:00)
are available in Japan the United States (3:58 - 4:02)
Hong Kong Taiwan Singapore Malaysia (4:00 - 4:05)
Philippines India Indonesia United (4:02 - 4:06)
Kingdom Spain Germany Italy France (4:05 - 4:09)
Canada Australia and New Zealand those (4:06 - 4:10)
are the only countries that exist (4:09 - 4:12)
there's not another country outside of (4:10 - 4:13)
those apparently nope (4:12 - 4:17)
not anymore but we we have not ordered (4:13 - 4:19)
any of them at least Greg didn't order (4:17 - 4:20)
any without telling me (4:19 - 4:22)
I have not ordered any I have looked at (4:20 - 4:24)
he here's the thing though I'm gonna (4:22 - 4:27)
take a side Trek just a quick moment now (4:24 - 4:29)
that we have Johto if they make it to (4:27 - 4:31)
Hoenn you know I'm buying a Rosalia (4:29 - 4:34)
shirt so do I need two of these shirts (4:31 - 4:37)
is that trade or because you don't like (4:34 - 4:40)
the Dunsparce mundum I don't like the (4:37 - 4:43)
Dunsparce pattern but there's rarely (4:40 - 4:47)
been a Rosalia anything that I haven't (4:43 - 4:51)
liked like dense parse is a unique (4:47 - 4:52)
I have to like something in Gen 2 (4:51 - 4:56)
because it's exist situation and people (4:52 - 4:58)
are like what's your favorite and Gen 2 (4:56 - 5:00)
and so you know you have to pick and so (4:58 - 5:02)
is the closer look like hold on oh no (5:00 - 5:04)
keep talking AHA it's a year qwilfish (5:02 - 5:07)
yeah it's ok I mean it's one of those (5:04 - 5:08)
shirts that are subtle that but it's (5:07 - 5:11)
green so it in what situation do you (5:08 - 5:12)
need to throw on a green shirt with a (5:11 - 5:16)
tie oh man awesome just mmm I'm about to (5:12 - 5:21)
hit by some is really good here's the (5:16 - 5:25)
thing a lot of these bold patterns are (5:21 - 5:28)
Hawaiian shirt material like you are (5:25 - 5:31)
these are more casual shirts a few of (5:28 - 5:32)
them I feel like if you're thinking oh (5:31 - 5:35)
I'm gonna wear pair this with a suit (5:32 - 5:38)
you're gonna have to pick very carefully (5:35 - 5:41)
now I would agree that I would argue (5:38 - 5:44)
that you could pair the qwilfish shirt (5:41 - 5:47)
with a suit a lot easier than the other (5:44 - 5:51)
bolder prints one at least is is more (5:47 - 5:54)
subtle and more accented and so like if (5:51 - 5:56)
you put that under a black suit and have (5:54 - 5:59)
a black tie on it like that shirts your (5:56 - 6:02)
point of interest for your suit makes a (5:59 - 6:04)
very plain suit something much more (6:02 - 6:06)
interesting there's no way you're (6:04 - 6:08)
wearing the bellossom shirt with a suit (6:06 - 6:11)
no I mean unless you're going like beach (6:08 - 6:13)
wedding where it's like you don't have a (6:11 - 6:16)
jacket you got slacks on this shirt and (6:13 - 6:19)
the shirts like half-open no tie I think (6:16 - 6:20)
is the only way you pull that up at a (6:19 - 6:21)
wedding (6:20 - 6:27)
how is Banfi and like porygon to or poor (6:21 - 6:29)
Ganzi already sold out yes I mean this (6:27 - 6:31)
is sold I'm surprised yeah so the (6:29 - 6:34)
unknown one is actually in Pokemon go as (6:31 - 6:38)
a shirt and I saw a lot of people - not (6:34 - 6:40)
a lot I saw a couple people well okay (6:38 - 6:42)
I saw the ratio of people I saw tweeting (6:40 - 6:44)
about the shirts a hundred percent of (6:42 - 6:46)
them were into the unknown shirt let's (6:44 - 6:49)
put it that way but the unknown shirt (6:46 - 6:52)
bothers me so much because it's the same (6:49 - 6:53)
shirt that it is in Pokemon go right (6:52 - 6:56)
they copied the design exactly and it (6:53 - 6:59)
has it unknown our letters obviously and (6:56 - 7:03)
it spells Pokemon except there's no e on (6:59 - 7:04)
the shirt (7:03 - 7:04)
it just says P (7:04 - 7:08)
okay mo n and a lot of people buy a lot (7:04 - 7:10)
of couple the people I saw buying it was (7:08 - 7:11)
like oh I can't wait to see what the (7:10 - 7:14)
back is all ease it's it's the set you (7:11 - 7:16)
can see it in Pokemon go it's it's the (7:14 - 7:19)
same it's all ease no it's just P okay (7:16 - 7:23)
mo N and for me I can't buy that shirt (7:19 - 7:26)
without that what there's no easy (7:23 - 7:31)
you are the e and maybe they I must they (7:26 - 7:33)
had to have done it to be like well (7:31 - 7:35)
there's no accent and technically the (7:33 - 7:38)
word is the accent so we can't we can't (7:35 - 7:40)
put the e on it but put the e on it or (7:38 - 7:42)
just put all the letter just put it put (7:40 - 7:44)
all of the whole alphabet (7:42 - 7:46)
yeah just put all the unknown on it can (7:44 - 7:50)
we take a quick side detour into both (7:46 - 7:53)
the smeargle and the Smoochum shirts (7:50 - 7:55)
real quick just pull pull those up the (7:53 - 7:58)
Smoochum is Saved by the Bell right yes (7:55 - 8:02)
it's like 90 sitcom bonanza yeah it's (7:58 - 8:06)
like the wildest thing it's like early (8:02 - 8:09)
nineties target Seinfeld and Saved by (8:06 - 8:09)
the Bell (8:09 - 8:12)
it's like Rocko's Modern Life cosplay (8:09 - 8:15)
would you say the other one was and then (8:12 - 8:17)
take a look at the eighties disaster (8:15 - 8:20)
that is smeared oh no it's all like the (8:17 - 8:25)
paint stuff but yes 80s it's so 80s I (8:20 - 8:27)
made these shirts in the 80s and early (8:25 - 8:30)
90s pokedex (8:27 - 8:31)
give me a Pokemon it's near it's right (8:30 - 8:34)
above em oh it's right next to Stantler (8:31 - 8:38)
Stantler Stantler the Stantler one is (8:34 - 8:40)
pretty good I will say the Stantler one (8:38 - 8:43)
is is although it's Stantler womp the (8:40 - 8:46)
design is really quite good but it is (8:43 - 8:50)
that smeargle shirt I wore some very (8:46 - 8:53)
very loud shirts in the 80s and the (8:50 - 8:55)
smeargle shirt would would have pushed (8:53 - 8:59)
my style I would say probably my (8:55 - 9:00)
favorite shirt on here that I wouldn't (8:59 - 9:02)
buy because it doesn't work with a tie (9:00 - 9:06)
maybe is like the flappy one oh I would (9:02 - 9:08)
not buy any of these as an actual no (9:06 - 9:10)
formal shirt I would only buy the (9:08 - 9:12)
Hawaiian shirt style and yeah yeah I (9:10 - 9:16)
would only buy formal why when do you (9:12 - 9:18)
ever wear a formal shirt I want to wear (9:16 - 9:18)
more for (9:18 - 9:21)
shirts for what possible job interviews (9:18 - 9:29)
my twitch career fails funerals sure to (9:21 - 9:32)
a funeral thing the fluffy is the ideal (9:29 - 9:35)
Hawaiian shirt okay that's a vacation (9:32 - 9:38)
you could do koala well that's some of (9:35 - 9:39)
these you can do is we talked about that (9:38 - 9:41)
some of these you can do is dress shirt (9:39 - 9:42)
it's koalas dress shirt material yeah (9:41 - 9:45)
and I actually really do like koala is (9:42 - 9:47)
my favorite evolution of the starters of (9:45 - 9:50)
that generation and I am I very very (9:47 - 9:52)
tempted by the Kolob a shirt because (9:50 - 9:54)
it's very understated and it focuses on (9:52 - 9:58)
the parts that I like it's got that sort (9:54 - 10:00)
of Punk edge to it that I love so much (9:58 - 10:03)
Chiquita's actually maybe dress shirt (10:00 - 10:05)
territory as well it's really subtle but (10:03 - 10:11)
really good yeah yeah I could see it let (10:05 - 10:13)
me see yeah I really like the Noctowl (10:11 - 10:14)
shirt although I think it's a little (10:13 - 10:16)
loud for dress shirt material yeah so (10:14 - 10:18)
for a dress shirt you want things that (10:16 - 10:20)
are more like the hoot-hoot which is a (10:18 - 10:24)
very simple repeat mostly white field I (10:20 - 10:26)
think yeah that's true (10:24 - 10:35)
like Picchu you know that looks great I (10:26 - 10:36)
would love to wear that as a Hawaiian (10:35 - 10:39)
shirt absolutely okay but look at it (10:36 - 10:41)
look at it as a dress shirt and just (10:39 - 10:45)
imagine that's coming at you I guess at (10:41 - 10:50)
a wedding or any other retirement event (10:45 - 10:53)
my French cuffs are we are we gonna (10:50 - 10:56)
ignore the Feraligatr nightmare we're (10:53 - 11:01)
just gonna ignore it's the hot crazy (10:56 - 11:04)
wild loud thing that is the front like (11:01 - 11:10)
every primary color every Oh primary all (11:04 - 11:13)
edgy that's like Nazis that - definitely (11:10 - 11:16)
has a theme going on well I didn't check (11:13 - 11:19)
out not to nothing that's definitely (11:16 - 11:21)
like not just a little cultural (11:19 - 11:24)
appropriation for me Nazis like I'm (11:21 - 11:27)
gonna go down to Potawatomi play some (11:24 - 11:31)
bingo I don't know I I think not - is (11:27 - 11:32)
more just like general Tsao (11:31 - 11:36)
West okay yes it's very geometric yeah (11:32 - 11:39)
okay it is like I'm putting that on to (11:36 - 11:43)
take my family out to some tex-mex my (11:39 - 11:45)
family to the O's to the old Corral (11:43 - 11:49)
people the crowd you can also wear the (11:45 - 11:52)
politoed shirt and with a suit easy did (11:49 - 11:54)
you check out the a pom one that is uh (11:52 - 11:58)
something oh my god Togepi is so good (11:54 - 12:02)
oh the a pump oh hey Bob what is (11:58 - 12:04)
something out of this world (12:02 - 12:09)
oh dude what is going on with this shirt (12:04 - 12:13)
it's a spongebob nightmare oh I love it (12:09 - 12:16)
I kind of the more I stare at it the (12:13 - 12:18)
more I like it it's definitely an 80s (12:16 - 12:21)
comedian he's like wanna wocka (12:18 - 12:23)
okay okay oh yeah core slow one I don't (12:21 - 12:26)
know if it's suit worthy I feel like (12:23 - 12:29)
maybe you could pull it off at UH at a (12:26 - 12:31)
more lenient wedding I feel like a lot (12:29 - 12:33)
of these are going out of stock as I'm (12:31 - 12:40)
looking at them more lenient wedding my (12:33 - 12:41)
sister's wedding (12:40 - 12:46)
okay anytime they're like your wedding I (12:41 - 12:47)
would say your wedding was not dress (12:46 - 12:52)
code lenient what what what it was a tie (12:47 - 12:55)
yeah be a mature sure could be any color (12:52 - 13:00)
you wanted no no my wedding was not I (12:55 - 13:01)
didn't want people to show up to my (13:00 - 13:04)
wedding this is my wedding my rules (13:01 - 13:11)
right thank you in any world khakis are (13:04 - 13:16)
good dress wear what and that I reads (13:11 - 13:17)
laughing in the other room at this and (13:16 - 13:23)
so when I khakis are like I I went to (13:17 - 13:23)
Kohl's (13:23 - 13:27)
and I spent 1499 on a pair of clearance (13:23 - 13:29)
khakis and now I'm dressed up no I had (13:27 - 13:33)
slacks minimum dress pants minimum at my (13:29 - 13:36)
wedding and everyone came in with dress (13:33 - 13:39)
pants the only person that had to switch (13:36 - 13:41)
the khakis was my friend Barry who split (13:39 - 13:43)
their pants on the dance floor (13:41 - 13:46)
retainer too hard and then too hard (13:43 - 13:48)
their pants completely split and they (13:46 - 13:52)
they ran upstairs got into khakis and (13:48 - 13:54)
then went the extra mile to ask if they (13:52 - 13:56)
could come back into the wedding because (13:54 - 13:58)
they knew khakis was not allowed at my (13:56 - 14:01)
wedding because I think khakis are tacky (13:58 - 14:05)
geez spend the you can go to Macy's (14:01 - 14:08)
whenever Macy's beautiful Target reopen (14:05 - 14:11)
the same $14 on slacks that you could on (14:08 - 14:15)
khakis and see would be like a okay what (14:11 - 14:18)
was my slacks are khaki colored yeah hmm (14:15 - 14:22)
you so you are you are Beija phobic is (14:18 - 14:24)
what you're saying what I'm saying is if (14:22 - 14:27)
a wedding is allowing you to wear khakis (14:24 - 14:29)
you could probably pull away with it you (14:27 - 14:30)
could probably get away with wearing any (14:29 - 14:34)
of these Pokemon shirts all I'm saying (14:30 - 14:36)
is you could have worn any of these (14:34 - 14:38)
shirts at my wedding and I would have (14:36 - 14:41)
been perfectly fine with it (14:38 - 14:43)
I would have applauded you and welcomed (14:41 - 14:44)
you into the family (14:43 - 14:47)
why is Pikachu surfing on the Gerudo (14:44 - 14:53)
shirt well I don't but went back to (14:47 - 14:55)
Kanto goes looking at other shirts to (14:53 - 14:57)
compare to see if their designs got like (14:55 - 15:00)
reused and I forgot the wildness that is (14:57 - 15:02)
the ekend shirt but that I was like Oh (15:00 - 15:03)
Gary just kind of looks like it could be (15:02 - 15:05)
a dress shirt and then there's a big old (15:03 - 15:06)
surfing Pikachu in it all right (15:05 - 15:08)

fishing seminar (15:08 - 15:20)

that one uh-oh also let me let me open (15:28 - 15:34)
my email original stitch did reach out (15:32 - 15:38)
to me original stitch is the company (15:34 - 15:41)
that makes these shirts in collaboration (15:38 - 15:43)
with the Pokemon company I don't think (15:41 - 15:44)
they're making any of these shirts I (15:43 - 15:45)
think they're just producing these (15:44 - 15:47)
shirts maybe they came up with the (15:45 - 15:49)
designs I'm find that hard to believe (15:47 - 15:52)
that they did okay another quick moment (15:49 - 15:56)

Hawaiian shirt is perfect okay I would (17:11 - 17:20)

pokémon master news of Pokemon comm (18:34 - 18:40)
April 2020 message from Pokemon master (18:36 - 18:42)
producers they're adding some things I'm (18:40 - 18:45)
going to not read off poke my Master's (18:42 - 18:46)
comm because that's way more detailed (18:45 - 18:48)
we'll just read off Pokemon that calm (18:46 - 18:51)
way more way more shorter so masters is (18:48 - 18:53)
doing a couple things number one they're (18:51 - 18:56)
adding eggs to the game Pokemon eggs (18:53 - 18:58)
make their first appearance in possio (18:56 - 19:00)
you'll be able to select your own egg to (18:58 - 19:01)
hatch into Bulbasaur Charmander squirtle (19:00 - 19:03)
and then the Pokemon will become your (19:01 - 19:05)
partner pokemon this is just a start (19:03 - 19:07)
more eggs featuring more Pokemon coming (19:05 - 19:08)
in future updates (19:07 - 19:11)
number two legendary event the next (19:08 - 19:13)
legendary event will feature the mighty (19:11 - 19:16)
ho-oh but will also features will also (19:13 - 19:19)
feature but also new features that will (19:16 - 19:22)
enhance the way you earn rewards the new (19:19 - 19:23)
prize box feature will let you collect (19:22 - 19:25)
prize coins from the event that will (19:23 - 19:27)
allow you to get items and advance the (19:25 - 19:29)
story you will also be able to use an (19:27 - 19:32)
item item called the boost ticket which (19:29 - 19:33)
will let you boost the rewards of (19:32 - 19:35)
battles before it starts previously (19:33 - 19:37)
there was only one boost reward per (19:35 - 19:38)
battle each day but now you can boost (19:37 - 19:40)
the same battle as many times as you (19:38 - 19:42)
want if you have enough tickets I don't (19:40 - 19:44)
know what that means Gregg you can fill (19:42 - 19:46)
me in there will also be a special item (19:44 - 19:47)
available in the event reward during the (19:46 - 19:49)
legendary event this will let you power (19:47 - 19:52)
up a 5 star strike sync pair I dunno (19:49 - 19:54)
what that is and then there will be some (19:52 - 19:57)
sync or adjustments in late April synch (19:54 - 19:59)
orbs will be easier to obtain thanks to (19:57 - 20:00)
a couple adjustments to the game you (19:59 - 20:02)
will be able to get more co-ops in (20:00 - 20:02)
corpse (20:02 - 20:04)
from events there will be opportunities (20:02 - 20:06)
to get sync orbs outside of battles with (20:04 - 20:09)
these changes sync orbs or specific sync (20:06 - 20:11)
pairs will become available in fixed (20:09 - 20:15)
while quantities as rewards so those are (20:11 - 20:17)
the three big updates I don't know if (20:15 - 20:19)
I'm allowed to say but like a couple (20:17 - 20:21)
months ago when I first signed on they (20:19 - 20:22)
said how do you feel about us adding (20:21 - 20:24)
eggs to the game and I was like I've (20:22 - 20:27)
been different but I guess here it is I (20:24 - 20:31)
mean still no skip tickets saw that (20:27 - 20:32)
people on reddit were suggesting that (20:31 - 20:34)
the egg Pokemon wouldn't evolve because (20:32 - 20:36)
then you would have multiple Charizard (20:34 - 20:39)
oh interesting do other Pokemon in the (20:36 - 20:40)
game evolve (20:39 - 20:43)
yeah not all the Pokemon involve a lot (20:40 - 20:46)
of them do now yeah since the change (20:43 - 20:48)
went in almost almost all of them have (20:46 - 20:51)
evolutions now I can't even get multiple (20:48 - 20:54)
Charizard we're eventually gonna get (20:51 - 20:57)
green and well we know that blue is (20:54 - 20:59)
coming with Blastoise and we know greens (20:57 - 21:01)
coming with Venus or I just don't know (20:59 - 21:03)
why they would give us an egg for us to (21:01 - 21:06)
get another Charizard Venus or Blastoise (21:03 - 21:08)
that's like the weird thing about it (21:06 - 21:12)
wait mmm because the egg is probably for (21:08 - 21:14)
your starter character right I'm yeah (21:12 - 21:16)
yeah it has to be I don't think you're (21:14 - 21:17)
getting an egg and then some random (21:16 - 21:19)
person paired with it and poke my (21:17 - 21:21)
Master's website they say more eggs are (21:19 - 21:23)
coming and then they show an egg next to (21:21 - 21:25)
a silhouette of tauros mouth and Scyther (21:23 - 21:30)
oh okay sure oh so did you I know what (21:25 - 21:34)
the boost yeah yeah yeah boost so have (21:30 - 21:37)
you I don't think you've ever like you (21:34 - 21:38)
know done haven't done any the big co-op (21:37 - 21:40)
events right no I have not (21:38 - 21:44)
so at the is most prevalent in the big (21:40 - 21:46)
co-op events but when you when you do (21:44 - 21:50)
that the first time a day you get extra (21:46 - 21:54)
XP and extra rewards so whatever that is (21:50 - 21:58)
giving like tickets or coins or whatever (21:54 - 22:00)
it's giving the first time you battle (21:58 - 22:03)
gives that reward plus extra so what (22:00 - 22:05)
they're saying is you can they'll not be (22:03 - 22:09)
including tickets so you know if you're (22:05 - 22:12)
on the ultra level one you can keep (22:09 - 22:14)
saying hey I want boosted rewards for (22:12 - 22:16)
this battle (22:14 - 22:19)
so I can keep getting the extra on top (22:16 - 22:21)
of my regular because right now you (22:19 - 22:24)
there's no reason to do that content (22:21 - 22:28)
more than once because the boosts are (22:24 - 22:30)
generally so much better than just the (22:28 - 22:32)
regular or rewards okay (22:30 - 22:34)
so good change yeah it's be interesting (22:32 - 22:37)
to say to see how many tickets you get (22:34 - 22:40)
like is it enough to make it worthwhile (22:37 - 22:42)
like how long do you have to save up (22:40 - 22:44)
before you're really feeling like you're (22:42 - 22:46)
gonna get a lot out of it but I think (22:44 - 22:49)
for before like the Mewtwo event or (22:46 - 22:51)
things like that where you need to run (22:49 - 22:53)
those things over and over and over and (22:51 - 22:55)
get to get the tickets to enhance that (22:53 - 22:58)
Pokemon to be able to save up tickets to (22:55 - 23:00)
say while I have to do this I'm gonna (22:58 - 23:03)
also try to get a bunch of extra rewards (23:00 - 23:05)
is is a good incentive to keep doing (23:03 - 23:07)
that content so like in those situations (23:05 - 23:09)
I can see it being pretty good the (23:07 - 23:12)
question is is whether you get enough of (23:09 - 23:13)
them or if you get so many of them it's (23:12 - 23:15)
worth using in other areas other than (23:13 - 23:17)
special events and I'm assuming a ho-oh (23:15 - 23:19)
is probably gonna be like so Galle oh I (23:17 - 23:22)
sure probably I can't imagine that (23:19 - 23:25)
they're gonna pair it with a random (23:22 - 23:27)
trainer like Mew silver would've maybe (23:25 - 23:29)
been the only one knob you and mu and (23:27 - 23:32)
okay I think makes sense make sense in (23:29 - 23:34)
the story that they provide to make it (23:32 - 23:36)
makes it alright that's so I'm not gonna (23:34 - 23:37)
disagree with you that's all that (23:36 - 23:42)
matters I know I refer to read it a lot (23:37 - 23:44)
because the the are slash Pokemon (23:42 - 23:46)
masters subreddit is actually pretty (23:44 - 23:48)
enthusiastic about the game and they (23:46 - 23:54)
haven't become jaded jaded they uh (23:48 - 23:56)
they're pretty positive they were they (23:54 - 23:58)
were thinking that how oh would be (23:56 - 24:00)
paired with silver but I don't think (23:58 - 24:02)
silver ever ahead ho-oh not that I know (24:00 - 24:05)
of at least I guess I think I mean that (24:02 - 24:07)
would maybe like maybe best character (24:05 - 24:08)
for silver because we talked about how (24:07 - 24:10)
Silver's Pokemon evolving taken by other (24:08 - 24:14)
people yeah but yeah I'm guessing ho-oh (24:10 - 24:17)
would probably just be you were just (24:14 - 24:18)
gonna be yours I think they're gonna (24:17 - 24:22)
always keep the big legendaries that (24:18 - 24:24)
aren't you like it made sense that (24:22 - 24:27)
Giovanni had Mewtwo are you still I (24:24 - 24:29)
think they could have given (24:27 - 24:31)
I think they could have given us mu and (24:29 - 24:33)
it'd have been fine but I think a lot of (24:31 - 24:35)
the big Legendary's are gonna make it (24:33 - 24:38)
for your standard character it's just (24:35 - 24:40)
the way they do it for sender character (24:38 - 24:42)
is so weird because it doesn't matter (24:40 - 24:43)
how you've leveled up anything else (24:42 - 24:46)
because you have to start over from (24:43 - 24:48)
scratch with this new partner Pokemon it (24:46 - 24:52)
starts over from level 1 the save up (24:48 - 24:56)
your books Hey look no Guzman my end no (24:52 - 25:01)
Hugh you never get Kuzma never used a (24:56 - 25:02)
book in my entire play of the game (25:01 - 25:05)
either kind of think of what character (25:02 - 25:06)
they would announce I mean for me it (25:05 - 25:08)
would be Hugh that I would I would go (25:06 - 25:11)
all-in and for gems it would for me and (25:08 - 25:11)
well (25:11 - 25:13)
Kuzma also I would go all-in and but (25:11 - 25:17)
then I ran out we add you into that too (25:13 - 25:18)
you're like no I gotta save it for (25:17 - 25:20)
something else or like nothing else I've (25:18 - 25:23)
had so many gems now I got nothing (25:20 - 25:27)
30,000 gems and now you get where I'm at (25:23 - 25:31)
at zero there was like a power I felt (25:27 - 25:34)
Greg having all these DIMMs yeah and now (25:31 - 25:36)
you're lonely like the rest of us I'm (25:34 - 25:40)
back up to 10k gems oh wow really I'm (25:36 - 25:43)
not I'm at I've logged in every day I (25:40 - 25:46)
mean when you're desperate for gems you (25:43 - 25:49)
make sure you log in every day I forget (25:46 - 25:52)
that my phone exists a lot when I'm home (25:49 - 25:55)
Wow if I'm ever two feet away from my (25:52 - 25:58)
phone my skin starts to itch well I mean (25:55 - 26:00)
I know it's in the house is usually on (25:58 - 26:02)
the desk next to me but what am it where (26:00 - 26:04)
it where my gyms where my gyms at I (26:02 - 26:07)
meant 3,000 gems right now are there any (26:04 - 26:11)
good banners no it's just Clement Oh (26:07 - 26:14)
gross oh yeah he's not great news I (26:11 - 26:15)
might I don't know I don't know if he's (26:14 - 26:17)
actually good or not at masters I just (26:15 - 26:21)
think in the TV show I already have (26:17 - 26:24)
three solid electrical types my own (26:21 - 26:28)
partner the Pikachu a lowland Pikachu (26:24 - 26:31)
and how both great (26:28 - 26:33)
and we'll then write you hello and write (26:31 - 26:37)
you and uh Eliza (26:33 - 26:40)
oh yeah I didn't get Rotom I only wrote (26:37 - 26:42)
something there yeah I've uh Eliza is my (26:40 - 26:44)
strongest sync pair so (26:42 - 26:47)
heliolisk would not be a gentleman for (26:44 - 26:50)
me to pull now that's it for the first (26:47 - 26:51)
half of the show we're gonna take a (26:50 - 26:53)
quick break when we come back we got (26:51 - 26:56)
some other news uh the most exciting (26:53 - 26:59)
thing is the at home community day so we (26:56 - 27:03)
will be right back (26:59 - 27:03)
they drop the ball in the word splash (27:04 - 27:07)
there probably could have been like (27:06 - 27:12)
making a zap making them (27:07 - 27:12)
[Music] (27:13 - 27:45)
[Laughter] (27:47 - 27:53)
[Music] (27:51 - 27:57)
before we start with the Pogo news (27:53 - 28:00)
I sent a message patreon I tweeted this (27:57 - 28:02)
but if you missed it because you only (28:00 - 28:05)
listened to the podcast pod a sir which (28:02 - 28:08)
is a podcast service that too long (28:05 - 28:11)
didn't read pod chasers trying to be the (28:08 - 28:15)
IMDB of the podcasting world trying to (28:11 - 28:17)
collect all the podcasts reviews people (28:15 - 28:20)
on it there they're like the IMDB of the (28:17 - 28:22)
podcast world anyways they're doing a (28:20 - 28:24)
really cool thing right now where if you (28:22 - 28:27)
leave a podcast a review from now till (28:24 - 28:29)
the end of the month April 30th they (28:27 - 28:32)
will donate 25 cents to meals-on-wheels (28:29 - 28:35)
and then if you leave a review and then (28:32 - 28:37)
I comment on the review as the podcast (28:35 - 28:39)
owner they will double it to 50 cents (28:37 - 28:42)
two people is a dollar ultimately (28:39 - 28:44)
because I've I've been commenting on (28:42 - 28:46)
everyone that has reviewed so I normally (28:44 - 28:48)
tell you guys to review in iTunes which (28:46 - 28:51)
you can still do if you haven't done (28:48 - 28:54)
that but I'll leave the link to that in (28:51 - 28:57)
the podcast show notes it's also on (28:54 - 28:59)
Twitter also I think pinned in slack but (28:57 - 29:01)
if you want to take a couple seconds (28:59 - 29:03)
leave a review that helps out the show (29:01 - 29:07)
also donates a couple cents to charity (29:03 - 29:10)
then I can also match that by commenting (29:07 - 29:12)
any review saying thank you so something (29:10 - 29:14)
to do something to think about goes to a (29:12 - 29:16)
good cause and that's it pretty easy (29:14 - 29:18)
that'll be in the show notes though (29:16 - 29:22)
let's talk about Community Day that's (29:18 - 29:23)
tomorrow (29:22 - 29:26)
right no that's next week oh wait what (29:23 - 29:28)
tomorrow is (29:26 - 29:33)
incense day hey wise trick (29:28 - 29:35)
we're recording this on Saturday because (29:33 - 29:38)
of the Pogo event tomorrow so tomorrow (29:35 - 29:40)
by the time you listen to this incense (29:38 - 29:41)
day will be over we'll have our thoughts (29:40 - 29:43)
on it I guess next week but pretty much (29:41 - 29:46)
every hour they're rotating out (29:43 - 29:48)
different types so from 11 to 12 will be (29:46 - 29:50)
water 12:00 the one will be by (29:48 - 29:54)
etc etc and rare Pokemon will appear so (29:50 - 29:57)
lit wick is pretty rare during the fired (29:54 - 30:01)
our your hopefully maybe going to see at (29:57 - 30:03)
least one lit wick I would assume yeah I (30:01 - 30:07)
would hope so they're doing that it's a (30:03 - 30:10)
six-hour event on Sunday 11 to 5 local (30:07 - 30:14)
times so I mean I don't have any (30:10 - 30:17)
expectations for this incense will (30:14 - 30:18)
attract more Sentret (30:17 - 30:22)
oh good but you use like I love the way (30:18 - 30:23)
that you say you have no expectations (30:22 - 30:24)
for it but I know you're going to (30:23 - 30:30)
complain about it once it's over I've (30:24 - 30:32)
made you long enough (30:30 - 30:35)
wait about the purloined event I thought (30:32 - 30:37)
that was pretty all right I mean it was (30:35 - 30:38)
poor alone there was really much to do (30:37 - 30:41)
with it but I don't remember a purloined (30:38 - 30:45)
event it was the Tuesday event not well (30:41 - 30:48)
not this week but it's it's though like (30:45 - 30:52)
every Tuesday yes every - so what was (30:48 - 30:54)
his last this last Tuesday was Magnemite (30:52 - 30:55)
I would actually say they messed up the (30:54 - 30:57)
Magnemite event there was not a lot of (30:55 - 30:59)
Magnemite but the purloined were (30:57 - 31:02)
everywhere and I did do the purloined (30:59 - 31:05)
event y'all know I didn't do that (31:02 - 31:08)
Magnemite a bit but you know ever (31:05 - 31:11)
everywhere purloined were everywhere and (31:08 - 31:13)
Magnemite not everywhere so I'm not sure (31:11 - 31:15)
what the difference was for that I think (31:13 - 31:19)
this week is Wobbuffet so we'll see okay (31:15 - 31:21)
that more exciting stuff Abra community (31:19 - 31:24)
today rescheduled Saturday April 25th (31:21 - 31:28)
it'll be six hours long they're calling (31:24 - 31:32)
it this is me antics words we'd like to (31:28 - 31:35)
introduce you to community day play at (31:32 - 31:39)
home edition hmm which i think is (31:35 - 31:42)
important because they're telling me (31:39 - 31:46)
that I'm going to hopefully get thee so (31:42 - 31:48)
for the safari zone event which I did at (31:46 - 31:52)
home for st. Louis I thought it was good (31:48 - 31:54)
I said this I'm sure it was recorded (31:52 - 31:56)
somewhere on some podcast I thought it (31:54 - 31:59)
was good but I did think that (31:56 - 32:01)
because I didn't go out and about like (31:59 - 32:04)
Greg I was at a disadvantage and not (32:01 - 32:07)
seeing stuff my expectations are (32:04 - 32:10)
hopefully this will be better hopefully (32:07 - 32:11)
they've used the events up to this point (32:10 - 32:14)
the purloined the Magnemite the incense (32:11 - 32:16)
days whatever else they've done and (32:14 - 32:20)
hopefully people who are playing at home (32:16 - 32:23)
feel like they did it because that's (32:20 - 32:24)
what you want yeah so that's my (32:23 - 32:27)
expectation what people want is a (32:24 - 32:29)
hundred shiny Abra so as long as they (32:27 - 32:31)
get a hundred shiny amber then they will (32:29 - 32:33)
be happy okay sure (32:31 - 32:37)
that's why I'm going for 100 shiny Abra (32:33 - 32:40)
Saturday April 25th 11:00 to 5:00 local (32:37 - 32:42)
time 6-hour event (32:40 - 32:44)
Abra will appear more frequently in the (32:42 - 32:46)
wild if you're lucky trainers you may (32:44 - 32:48)
encounter shiny Abra (32:46 - 32:50)
you can evolve Abra two hours after the (32:48 - 32:52)
event is over for Alakazam to know the (32:50 - 32:54)
exclusive move it is counter they are (32:52 - 32:58)
introducing in a dollar community day (32:54 - 33:01)
exclusive special research story called (32:58 - 33:04)
investigating illusions for one dollar (33:01 - 33:08)
let me sell you on this for one got it (33:04 - 33:14)
okay you can get 13,000 Stardust ape (33:08 - 33:18)
often a rocket radar and quote other (33:14 - 33:20)
rewards I don't know what those are (33:18 - 33:22)
rocket radar I think is normal 2 bucks (33:20 - 33:24)
puffins is normally $1.00 Stardust (33:22 - 33:26)
doesn't really have a price but you like (33:24 - 33:29)
powering a pokemon that's probably (33:26 - 33:30)
important to you they take it to the (33:29 - 33:33)
special research not refundable and then (33:30 - 33:35)
the antic on their website Pokemon go (33:33 - 33:36)
live calm says we're continuing to (33:35 - 33:38)
prioritize the Pokemon go experience (33:36 - 33:41)
here are some temporary things we were (33:38 - 33:43)
changing for again what they say is (33:41 - 33:47)
community day play at home edition it (33:43 - 33:50)
will run 6 hours and sub-3 there will be (33:47 - 33:53)
a three times sketch Stardust bonus news (33:50 - 33:57)
of the two so I would use your Stardust (33:53 - 34:00)
thing if you have it ler modules will (33:57 - 34:03)
last three hours for the duration of the (34:00 - 34:07)
event you only have to use two to cover (34:03 - 34:08)
the entire event if you're gonna play (34:07 - 34:09)
for six hours straight (34:08 - 34:12)
buddy Pokemon of a buddy level great (34:09 - 34:13)
buddy or high (34:12 - 34:16)
we'll bring you helpful items throughout (34:13 - 34:19)
the event such as pokeballs so if you (34:16 - 34:21)
have a great buddy make sure that you (34:19 - 34:23)
have them equipped not not probably the (34:21 - 34:25)
best time to start a new buddy I think (34:23 - 34:27)
great buddy is two-star which is about (34:25 - 34:29)
seven days with the buddy so get it I'm (34:27 - 34:31)
hopefully by now if you're listening to (34:29 - 34:33)
this you have at least one great buddy (34:31 - 34:36)
there will be a one-time special (34:33 - 34:37)
purchase if you want called the abre (34:36 - 34:41)
community bundle it'll have an elite (34:37 - 34:43)
charge TM 30 ultra balls three super (34:41 - 34:45)
incubators and then three in cents for (34:43 - 34:48)
twelve hundred and eighty pokey coins I (34:45 - 34:49)
got a couple problems with this number (34:48 - 34:51)
one why is it 1280 why just make it (34:49 - 34:53)
twelve number two it's complete ripoff (34:51 - 34:59)
so don't even bother buying it taxes and (34:53 - 35:01)
then they said take a snapshot during (34:59 - 35:03)
community day event for a surprise okay (35:01 - 35:05)
so there's no price on pokeball there's (35:03 - 35:07)
no price on ultra balls super incubators (35:05 - 35:10)
what are they two bucks so if we're (35:07 - 35:12)
assuming that you know super incubators (35:10 - 35:13)
if you're paying for super incubators (35:12 - 35:17)
full price that's six bucks in cents is (35:13 - 35:20)
80 cents if you're paying that full (35:17 - 35:22)
price that's uh which no one is for any (35:20 - 35:25)
of these items that's 240 so for eight (35:22 - 35:28)
dollars it around it and we round it for (35:25 - 35:30)
eight bucks then you're paying four (35:28 - 35:33)
dollars for a item an elite charge TM (35:30 - 35:36)
that lets you change and guarantee a (35:33 - 35:39)
move on a Pokemon including legacy moves (35:36 - 35:43)
it's just it's really it's really pay to (35:39 - 35:45)
win competitive wise maybe it's maybe (35:43 - 35:47)
it's I don't know I mean to get a (35:45 - 35:50)
competitive Pokemon for Pokemon go (35:47 - 35:54)
battle league yeah for example you can't (35:50 - 35:56)
you can't get Shadow Ball on me - but (35:54 - 35:58)
Shadow Ball is the go-to on Mewtwo so (35:56 - 36:03)
are you willing to pay 12 bucks get your (35:58 - 36:05)
super incubators get your incense and (36:03 - 36:07)
then get your shadow ball on your Mewtwo (36:05 - 36:10)
no the answer is No some people users (36:07 - 36:13)
know yeah well you know you want to win (36:10 - 36:15)
I guess yeah I don't (36:13 - 36:17)
mmm sure so (36:15 - 36:20)
I I personally think it's a ripoff I get (36:17 - 36:22)
it if you're in a PvP probably an (36:20 - 36:25)
investment for you but I gave you my (36:22 - 36:27)
thoughts on PvP last week I want to like (36:25 - 36:29)
it I want them to be better I don't (36:27 - 36:30)
think this is the right step (36:29 - 36:33)
but the positive note is I do think that (36:30 - 36:34)
99 cents I do think that's fun I do (36:33 - 36:37)
think that's that's worth it I feel like (36:34 - 36:38)
if you don't pay the dollar you're not (36:37 - 36:39)
missing out if you do pay the dollar (36:38 - 36:40)
it's literally a dollar (36:39 - 36:43)
you do get some bonuses with that I will (36:40 - 36:44)
be buying the dollar (36:43 - 36:47)

some stone in that game but the while (51:02 - 51:08)
the minigames were fun but then you just (51:05 - 51:10)
had the the huge amount of (51:08 - 51:12)
disappointment when you came in first (51:10 - 51:14)
place and they gave you like two coins (51:12 - 51:16)
for first place and then you walk over (51:14 - 51:18)

seconds to name it off the top of your I (51:46 - 51:50)
don't know the names of them what was it (51:47 - 51:52)
based off of you know what sports are oh (51:50 - 51:56)
gosh the the track and field one was (51:52 - 51:58)
pretty good or you had to run and jump (51:56 - 52:01)
there was the one - there was the one (51:58 - 52:03)
where you were jumping off the (52:01 - 52:06)
trampolines I think and collecting stuff (52:03 - 52:08)
that one's pretty alright there was oh (52:06 - 52:10)
they're the coolest one which is also (52:08 - 52:12)
the most frustrating one was like there (52:10 - 52:16)
was it wasn't it wasn't like the brooms (52:12 - 52:18)
and the things moving over but you had (52:16 - 52:22)
to was it what do they call that brooms (52:18 - 52:24)
and then the giant discs that you had to (52:22 - 52:25)
put her away earlier it was kind of like (52:24 - 52:30)
cooling you're talking about there's (52:25 - 52:32)
like a curling esque one that's pretty (52:30 - 52:35)
good you know how hard it is to get into (52:32 - 52:38)
a curling club here in Minneapolis it (52:35 - 52:39)
pours yes (52:38 - 52:43)
they are full you cannot curl if you (52:39 - 52:44)
want desperately need to curl for your (52:43 - 52:48)
life so okay (52:44 - 52:51)
which okay I'm I'm on the page was are (52:48 - 52:54)
you talking about (52:51 - 52:57)
was the trampoline one lamp jump that (52:54 - 53:01)
sounds right okay then the curling one (52:57 - 53:06)
the curling one is is it the no not (53:01 - 53:09)
rigged drop oh it's a it's circle pushed (53:06 - 53:12)
circle push it like that one circle push (53:09 - 53:16)

these names are I just saw these names (53:16 - 53:21)
there okay here's can we go can we go (53:18 - 53:23)
outside the question this is the thing (53:21 - 53:25)
that would be very cool (53:23 - 53:26)
another thing heartgold SoulSilver (53:25 - 53:31)
little gold and silver very unique to (53:26 - 53:33)
the johto region probably somebody's (53:31 - 53:34)
favorite anytime somebody is like oh my (53:33 - 53:36)
favorite game is hard cold still silver (53:34 - 53:37)
my favorite game is gold and silver they (53:36 - 53:39)
never bring this up this is a valid (53:37 - 53:40)
reason though if they were to tell me (53:39 - 53:42)
this is why they're the their games are (53:40 - 53:44)
their favorite the buck caching contest (53:42 - 53:48)
is it rigged yes but yes it's rigged (53:44 - 53:51)
it's like that that would be like those (53:48 - 53:54)
kind of contests especially in a game (53:51 - 53:57)
you know now that not that every video (53:54 - 53:58)
game in the world is like a living game (53:57 - 54:00)
and has these these events and that's (53:58 - 54:01)
literally the only thing to really look (54:00 - 54:03)
forward to now in Animal Crossing is (54:01 - 54:06)
what event is coming up next but if you (54:03 - 54:08)
know yeah cuz you gobbled it up so you (54:06 - 54:11)
got because you got twelve million bells (54:08 - 54:14)
here and sharing it just like Bezos in a (54:11 - 54:16)
you know future Pokemon game if like (54:14 - 54:19)
every Saturday there was a fishing (54:16 - 54:22)
contest or a bug catching contest or a (54:19 - 54:26)
fossil finding contest of like dig a (54:22 - 54:27)
bunch of holes and whoever finds the (54:26 - 54:32)
biggest Nana Ruth wins Vera finds the (54:27 - 54:33)
biggest hole wins (54:32 - 54:36)
I would see ya like it'd be fun to have (54:33 - 54:41)
like weekly events I think it'd be fun (54:36 - 54:43)
to have it in the wild area be like like (54:41 - 54:46)
an alternate form of versus battle where (54:43 - 54:48)
like everybody's connected in the wild (54:46 - 54:49)
there yet but connect to the Internet (54:48 - 54:51)
and then there's like a weird global (54:49 - 54:53)
ranking that would be fun well yeah like (54:51 - 54:55)
you can run up to people and be like our (54:53 - 55:00)
eyes met time to battle and prepare to (54:55 - 55:03)
get pwned (55:00 - 55:05)
my answer for this question of the week (55:03 - 55:09)
is the little minigames in pokemon black (55:05 - 55:11)
and white where you could go and visit (55:09 - 55:14)
while your friend was playing locally (55:11 - 55:15)
you could go and visit their world and (55:14 - 55:18)
you had little tasks that you had to (55:15 - 55:20)
complete in order to gain points that (55:18 - 55:22)
that was fun (55:20 - 55:24)
it was a lot of fun because it would be (55:22 - 55:29)
a thing now you'd go to the the tree in (55:24 - 55:33)
the middle on on tree on tree now in the (55:29 - 55:36)
middle on tree it's also where you would (55:33 - 55:39)
go to collect like if you had caught (55:36 - 55:41)
Pokemon in the dream world you dare to (55:39 - 55:44)
come up but then from the on tree you (55:41 - 55:46)
could basically it was like basically (55:44 - 55:47)
entering the dream world was entering (55:46 - 55:49)
your friends game you would either go (55:47 - 55:51)
over the bridge on the right or over the (55:49 - 55:55)
bridge on the left yeah find your friend (55:51 - 55:57)
in the game and give them an apple and (55:55 - 56:00)
then like that I mean it's just like (55:57 - 56:03)
it's so it was like such fueled my (56:00 - 56:04)
imagination that I was literally (56:03 - 56:07)
visiting their Pokemon world that one (56:04 - 56:09)
was very good I would do that again (56:07 - 56:11)
especially now that we have a much (56:09 - 56:15)
stronger internet braid area that sing (56:11 - 56:18)
that absolutely will you want to wrap it (56:15 - 56:21)

event password Articuno is the last (60:17 - 60:22)
genuine Pokemon to be introduced in the (60:20 - 60:25)
anime and the only one that did not (60:22 - 60:28)
appear in season one if the movies and (60:25 - 60:30)
banned episodes are included mu is the (60:28 - 60:34)

appearance in the movies if the movies (60:34 - 60:38)

alright you ready for this week's pokum (61:25 - 61:28)
I am (61:26 - 61:33)
so this one an extra clue I actually (61:28 - 61:37)
learned it and stole it a little bit (61:33 - 61:40)
little cross-promotion from another (61:37 - 61:45)
podcast that Greg does Greg's gonna get (61:40 - 61:48)
it immediately unless his memory is real (61:45 - 61:52)
bad my memory is all right here we go (61:48 - 61:56)
according to Wikipedia lasats were a (61:52 - 62:00)
humanoid sentient species native to the (61:56 - 62:03)
wild space planet leiris on (62:00 - 62:06)
additionally they had settled the outer (62:03 - 62:10)
rim world of las' on which for quite (62:06 - 62:12)
some time was thought to be the only (62:10 - 62:15)
world they inhabited lasats speak a (62:12 - 62:18)
language called Lizotte of which we (62:15 - 62:21)
currently know four words (62:18 - 62:25)
Ashla meaning the force bogan (62:21 - 62:27)
potentially used to describe annoying (62:25 - 62:31)
creatures ash buh meaning steady or (62:27 - 62:34)
balanced their fourth word is an (62:31 - 62:38)
exclamation used in moments of crisis (62:34 - 62:42)
potentially an expletive it also sounds (62:38 - 62:45)
similar to although not exactly the same (62:42 - 62:49)
as this week's Pokemon while it is not a (62:45 - 62:52)
mechanical Pokemon this week's pokémon (62:49 - 62:55)
requires both electrical stimulation and (62:52 - 62:59)
another pokemons presence to evolve this (62:55 - 63:01)
is most likely why this Pokemon can be (62:59 - 63:05)
found near charged stone cave worldwide (63:01 - 63:07)
this Pokemon was part of a distribution (63:05 - 63:12)
event in 2011 while it was distributed (63:07 - 63:15)
