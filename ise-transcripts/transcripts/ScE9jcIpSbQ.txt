[Music] what's up everyone welcome to another episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ episode 405 feel like I did this in the wrong order Greg Here I am Here I I have your back whatever episode this is okay well also here and I will always love you I knew that was coming much music on this show there's not there's not enough music on this show I'm gonna do the Dolly Parton version and Greg is gonna do the Whitney Houston version oh yeah so we've been trying to aim for these shows to be closer to an hour because of how many people are working at home and not commuting myself included my podcast listening has gone dramatically down I think I said this last week but I think I cut it so hopefully this doesn't get cut so you probably noticed that well quit cutting it you have control you're actually like some third it's like some third party when I end of the podcast I'm mostly cutting myself because you cut out the Minnesota weather report on the last one that I listened to so I did I did hey you need that first like five minutes to be strong otherwise people are gonna turn it off this is the strong intro we're offering if we ever had a first five minutes that are strong I was going to say what's not strong about our proud Minnesota folk breathing before winters you start the show every time that is starting on our weakest foot oh wow oh gosh so we have a show for you guys that and that's not so much sort of Shield stuff we have a lot of Pokemon go stuff they're really trying to make it so you can play at home and have a good time we're gonna talk about this I know some people don't care about Pokemon go I know some of you guys do care about Pokemon go it is what it is there's a lot that they're trying actively to do and I feel like we need to talk about that there's some new shirts from original stitch the johto stuff came out we're gonna talk about that and there's a new masters updates probably another two or three things that I can't figure out what we're talking about in what order but that's why we have a break in the show bag you can talk about everything we were supposed to that being said let's talk about the original stitch shirts we've talked about them before we've covered the entire journey of those being japanese-only shirts then during that announcement were they it was I'm pretty sure was the announcement where they said like let's go Pikachu is coming out another game is gonna come out after it we don't have a name for it there's a new Pokemon Center opening up in Shibuya and original shirts will be available in the UK Canada in the US sometime later this year I think that was all the same announcement yeah I think so the original shirts came and kind of went does it I'm sure people did stock up on them they did add them to the added four of the designs - Pokemon go like eight months ago and then they just added another four designs like a month ago which we covered but the Jojo stuff is out it goes from Chikorita is that the first one yes chikorita - oh no Celebi yet and they are available in Japan the United States Hong Kong Taiwan Singapore Malaysia Philippines India Indonesia United Kingdom Spain Germany Italy France Canada Australia and New Zealand those are the only countries that exist there's not another country outside of those apparently nope not anymore but we we have not ordered any of them at least Greg didn't order any without telling me I have not ordered any I have looked at he here's the thing though I'm gonna take a side Trek just a quick moment now that we have Johto if they make it to Hoenn you know I'm buying a Rosalia shirt so do I need two of these shirts is that trade or because you don't like the Dunsparce mundum I don't like the Dunsparce pattern but there's rarely been a Rosalia anything that I haven't liked like dense parse is a unique I have to like something in Gen 2 because it's exist situation and people are like what's your favorite and Gen 2 and so you know you have to pick and so is the closer look like hold on oh no keep talking AHA it's a year qwilfish yeah it's ok I mean it's one of those shirts that are subtle that but it's green so it in what situation do you need to throw on a green shirt with a tie oh man awesome just mmm I'm about to hit by some is really good here's the thing a lot of these bold patterns are Hawaiian shirt material like you are these are more casual shirts a few of them I feel like if you're thinking oh I'm gonna wear pair this with a suit you're gonna have to pick very carefully now I would agree that I would argue that you could pair the qwilfish shirt with a suit a lot easier than the other bolder prints one at least is is more subtle and more accented and so like if you put that under a black suit and have a black tie on it like that shirts your point of interest for your suit makes a very plain suit something much more interesting there's no way you're wearing the bellossom shirt with a suit no I mean unless you're going like beach wedding where it's like you don't have a jacket you got slacks on this shirt and the shirts like half-open no tie I think is the only way you pull that up at a wedding how is Banfi and like porygon to or poor Ganzi already sold out yes I mean this is sold I'm surprised yeah so the unknown one is actually in Pokemon go as a shirt and I saw a lot of people - not a lot I saw a couple people well okay I saw the ratio of people I saw tweeting about the shirts a hundred percent of them were into the unknown shirt let's put it that way but the unknown shirt bothers me so much because it's the same shirt that it is in Pokemon go right they copied the design exactly and it has it unknown our letters obviously and it spells Pokemon except there's no e on the shirt it just says P okay mo n and a lot of people buy a lot of couple the people I saw buying it was like oh I can't wait to see what the back is all ease it's it's the set you can see it in Pokemon go it's it's the same it's all ease no it's just P okay mo N and for me I can't buy that shirt without that what there's no easy you are the e and maybe they I must they had to have done it to be like well there's no accent and technically the word is the accent so we can't we can't put the e on it but put the e on it or just put all the letter just put it put all of the whole alphabet yeah just put all the unknown on it can we take a quick side detour into both the smeargle and the Smoochum shirts real quick just pull pull those up the Smoochum is Saved by the Bell right yes it's like 90 sitcom bonanza yeah it's like the wildest thing it's like early nineties target Seinfeld and Saved by the Bell it's like Rocko's Modern Life cosplay would you say the other one was and then take a look at the eighties disaster that is smeared oh no it's all like the paint stuff but yes 80s it's so 80s I made these shirts in the 80s and early 90s pokedex give me a Pokemon it's near it's right above em oh it's right next to Stantler Stantler Stantler the Stantler one is pretty good I will say the Stantler one is is although it's Stantler womp the design is really quite good but it is that smeargle shirt I wore some very very loud shirts in the 80s and the smeargle shirt would would have pushed my style I would say probably my favorite shirt on here that I wouldn't buy because it doesn't work with a tie maybe is like the flappy one oh I would not buy any of these as an actual no formal shirt I would only buy the Hawaiian shirt style and yeah yeah I would only buy formal why when do you ever wear a formal shirt I want to wear more for shirts for what possible job interviews my twitch career fails funerals sure to a funeral thing the fluffy is the ideal Hawaiian shirt okay that's a vacation you could do koala well that's some of these you can do is we talked about that some of these you can do is dress shirt it's koalas dress shirt material yeah and I actually really do like koala is my favorite evolution of the starters of that generation and I am I very very tempted by the Kolob a shirt because it's very understated and it focuses on the parts that I like it's got that sort of Punk edge to it that I love so much Chiquita's actually maybe dress shirt territory as well it's really subtle but really good yeah yeah I could see it let me see yeah I really like the Noctowl shirt although I think it's a little loud for dress shirt material yeah so for a dress shirt you want things that are more like the hoot-hoot which is a very simple repeat mostly white field I think yeah that's true like Picchu you know that looks great I would love to wear that as a Hawaiian shirt absolutely okay but look at it look at it as a dress shirt and just imagine that's coming at you I guess at a wedding or any other retirement event my French cuffs are we are we gonna ignore the Feraligatr nightmare we're just gonna ignore it's the hot crazy wild loud thing that is the front like every primary color every Oh primary all edgy that's like Nazis that - definitely has a theme going on well I didn't check out not to nothing that's definitely like not just a little cultural appropriation for me Nazis like I'm gonna go down to Potawatomi play some bingo I don't know I I think not - is more just like general Tsao West okay yes it's very geometric yeah okay it is like I'm putting that on to take my family out to some tex-mex my family to the O's to the old Corral people the crowd you can also wear the politoed shirt and with a suit easy did you check out the a pom one that is uh something oh my god Togepi is so good oh the a pump oh hey Bob what is something out of this world oh dude what is going on with this shirt it's a spongebob nightmare oh I love it I kind of the more I stare at it the more I like it it's definitely an 80s comedian he's like wanna wocka okay okay oh yeah core slow one I don't know if it's suit worthy I feel like maybe you could pull it off at UH at a more lenient wedding I feel like a lot of these are going out of stock as I'm looking at them more lenient wedding my sister's wedding okay anytime they're like your wedding I would say your wedding was not dress code lenient what what what it was a tie yeah be a mature sure could be any color you wanted no no my wedding was not I didn't want people to show up to my wedding this is my wedding my rules right thank you in any world khakis are good dress wear what and that I reads laughing in the other room at this and so when I khakis are like I I went to Kohl's and I spent 1499 on a pair of clearance khakis and now I'm dressed up no I had slacks minimum dress pants minimum at my wedding and everyone came in with dress pants the only person that had to switch the khakis was my friend Barry who split their pants on the dance floor retainer too hard and then too hard their pants completely split and they they ran upstairs got into khakis and then went the extra mile to ask if they could come back into the wedding because they knew khakis was not allowed at my wedding because I think khakis are tacky geez spend the you can go to Macy's whenever Macy's beautiful Target reopen the same $14 on slacks that you could on khakis and see would be like a okay what was my slacks are khaki colored yeah hmm you so you are you are Beija phobic is what you're saying what I'm saying is if a wedding is allowing you to wear khakis you could probably pull away with it you could probably get away with wearing any of these Pokemon shirts all I'm saying is you could have worn any of these shirts at my wedding and I would have been perfectly fine with it I would have applauded you and welcomed you into the family why is Pikachu surfing on the Gerudo shirt well I don't but went back to Kanto goes looking at other shirts to compare to see if their designs got like reused and I forgot the wildness that is the ekend shirt but that I was like Oh Gary just kind of looks like it could be a dress shirt and then there's a big old surfing Pikachu in it all right we'll end with this if you're going to a fishing seminar check out the remoraid shirt has your back that's all I'm saying welcome to fishing 101 okay we're gonna cover rules and regulations and with that one uh-oh also let me let me open my email original stitch did reach out to me original stitch is the company that makes these shirts in collaboration with the Pokemon company I don't think they're making any of these shirts I think they're just producing these shirts maybe they came up with the designs I'm find that hard to believe that they did okay another quick moment why is Vica volt on the heracross shirt oh yeah I don't know it's Vikon vault by the way whatever okay original stitch reached out they said we saw your tweet thank you so much for letting people know about the johto fabric if you want for your community use code pokey master P oke mas ter for any

right now what color buttons do I put why do they have to give me a choice I can't make a choice I do now I think the red possibly is gonna contrast too much but keep it green yeah I think though do you want to be really fancy will I think you do the inside cuffs the lady ba ah no I once again I told you I would not buy any of these as a long-sleeve dress shirt I would only buy the Hawaiian shirt style and especially the blossom princess Hawaiian shirt is perfect okay I would say I'm going I'm looking at rusted wood I was rested wood or marbled black works pretty good can't zoom in on the picture can you know you can't oh you can't change the you can't change its with the Hawaiian that's like one and done yeah with the dress shirt so you got a lot of options here you got a lot more options then I get French cuffs rusted wood or dark gray that those are my choices well we'll find out when this shirt arrives I would actually maybe go with the light natural shoe or their natural

here ed p.m. and KS industries we are committed to bring the most quality of discount codes and sell up material speaking of partnerships full disclosure I'm partnered with DNA this is our pokémon master news of Pokemon comm April 2020 message from Pokemon master producers they're adding some things I'm going to not read off poke my Master's comm because that's way more detailed we'll just read off Pokemon that calm way more way more shorter so masters is doing a couple things number one they're adding eggs to the game Pokemon eggs make their first appearance in possio you'll be able to select your own egg to hatch into Bulbasaur Charmander squirtle and then the Pokemon will become your partner pokemon this is just a start more eggs featuring more Pokemon coming in future updates number two legendary event the next legendary event will feature the mighty ho-oh but will also features will also feature but also new features that will enhance the way you earn rewards the new prize box feature will let you collect prize coins from the event that will allow you to get items and advance the story you will also be able to use an item item called the boost ticket which will let you boost the rewards of battles before it starts previously there was only one boost reward per battle each day but now you can boost the same battle as many times as you want if you have enough tickets I don't know what that means Gregg you can fill me in there will also be a special item available in the event reward during the legendary event this will let you power up a 5 star strike sync pair I dunno what that is and then there will be some sync or adjustments in late April synch orbs will be easier to obtain thanks to a couple adjustments to the game you will be able to get more co-ops in corpse from events there will be opportunities to get sync orbs outside of battles with these changes sync orbs or specific sync pairs will become available in fixed while quantities as rewards so those are the three big updates I don't know if I'm allowed to say but like a couple months ago when I first signed on they said how do you feel about us adding eggs to the game and I was like I've been different but I guess here it is I mean still no skip tickets saw that people on reddit were suggesting that the egg Pokemon wouldn't evolve because then you would have multiple Charizard oh interesting do other Pokemon in the game evolve yeah not all the Pokemon involve a lot of them do now yeah since the change went in almost almost all of them have evolutions now I can't even get multiple Charizard we're eventually gonna get green and well we know that blue is coming with Blastoise and we know greens coming with Venus or I just don't know why they would give us an egg for us to get another Charizard Venus or Blastoise that's like the weird thing about it wait mmm because the egg is probably for your starter character right I'm yeah yeah it has to be I don't think you're getting an egg and then some random person paired with it and poke my Master's website they say more eggs are coming and then they show an egg next to a silhouette of tauros mouth and Scyther oh okay sure oh so did you I know what the boost yeah yeah yeah boost so have you I don't think you've ever like you know done haven't done any the big co-op events right no I have not so at the is most prevalent in the big co-op events but when you when you do that the first time a day you get extra XP and extra rewards so whatever that is giving like tickets or coins or whatever it's giving the first time you battle gives that reward plus extra so what they're saying is you can they'll not be including tickets so you know if you're on the ultra level one you can keep saying hey I want boosted rewards for this battle so I can keep getting the extra on top of my regular because right now you there's no reason to do that content more than once because the boosts are generally so much better than just the regular or rewards okay so good change yeah it's be interesting to say to see how many tickets you get like is it enough to make it worthwhile like how long do you have to save up before you're really feeling like you're gonna get a lot out of it but I think for before like the Mewtwo event or things like that where you need to run those things over and over and over and get to get the tickets to enhance that Pokemon to be able to save up tickets to say while I have to do this I'm gonna also try to get a bunch of extra rewards is is a good incentive to keep doing that content so like in those situations I can see it being pretty good the question is is whether you get enough of them or if you get so many of them it's worth using in other areas other than special events and I'm assuming a ho-oh is probably gonna be like so Galle oh I sure probably I can't imagine that they're gonna pair it with a random trainer like Mew silver would've maybe been the only one knob you and mu and okay I think makes sense make sense in the story that they provide to make it makes it alright that's so I'm not gonna disagree with you that's all that matters I know I refer to read it a lot because the the are slash Pokemon masters subreddit is actually pretty enthusiastic about the game and they haven't become jaded jaded they uh they're pretty positive they were they were thinking that how oh would be paired with silver but I don't think silver ever ahead ho-oh not that I know of at least I guess I think I mean that would maybe like maybe best character for silver because we talked about how Silver's Pokemon evolving taken by other people yeah but yeah I'm guessing ho-oh would probably just be you were just gonna be yours I think they're gonna always keep the big legendaries that aren't you like it made sense that Giovanni had Mewtwo are you still I think they could have given I think they could have given us mu and it'd have been fine but I think a lot of the big Legendary's are gonna make it for your standard character it's just the way they do it for sender character is so weird because it doesn't matter how you've leveled up anything else because you have to start over from scratch with this new partner Pokemon it starts over from level 1 the save up your books Hey look no Guzman my end no Hugh you never get Kuzma never used a book in my entire play of the game either kind of think of what character they would announce I mean for me it would be Hugh that I would I would go all-in and for gems it would for me and well Kuzma also I would go all-in and but then I ran out we add you into that too you're like no I gotta save it for something else or like nothing else I've had so many gems now I got nothing 30,000 gems and now you get where I'm at at zero there was like a power I felt Greg having all these DIMMs yeah and now you're lonely like the rest of us I'm back up to 10k gems oh wow really I'm not I'm at I've logged in every day I mean when you're desperate for gems you make sure you log in every day I forget that my phone exists a lot when I'm home Wow if I'm ever two feet away from my phone my skin starts to itch well I mean I know it's in the house is usually on the desk next to me but what am it where it where my gyms where my gyms at I meant 3,000 gems right now are there any good banners no it's just Clement Oh gross oh yeah he's not great news I might I don't know I don't know if he's actually good or not at masters I just think in the TV show I already have three solid electrical types my own partner the Pikachu a lowland Pikachu and how both great and we'll then write you hello and write you and uh Eliza oh yeah I didn't get Rotom I only wrote something there yeah I've uh Eliza is my strongest sync pair so heliolisk would not be a gentleman for me to pull now that's it for the first half of the show we're gonna take a quick break when we come back we got some other news uh the most exciting thing is the at home community day so we will be right back they drop the ball in the word splash there probably could have been like making a zap making them [Music] [Laughter] [Music] before we start with the Pogo news I sent a message patreon I tweeted this but if you missed it because you only listened to the podcast pod a sir which is a podcast service that too long didn't read pod chasers trying to be the IMDB of the podcasting world trying to collect all the podcasts reviews people on it there they're like the IMDB of the podcast world anyways they're doing a really cool thing right now where if you leave a podcast a review from now till the end of the month April 30th they will donate 25 cents to meals-on-wheels and then if you leave a review and then I comment on the review as the podcast owner they will double it to 50 cents two people is a dollar ultimately because I've I've been commenting on everyone that has reviewed so I normally tell you guys to review in iTunes which you can still do if you haven't done that but I'll leave the link to that in the podcast show notes it's also on Twitter also I think pinned in slack but if you want to take a couple seconds leave a review that helps out the show also donates a couple cents to charity then I can also match that by commenting any review saying thank you so something to do something to think about goes to a good cause and that's it pretty easy that'll be in the show notes though let's talk about Community Day that's tomorrow right no that's next week oh wait what tomorrow is incense day hey wise trick we're recording this on Saturday because of the Pogo event tomorrow so tomorrow by the time you listen to this incense day will be over we'll have our thoughts on it I guess next week but pretty much every hour they're rotating out different types so from 11 to 12 will be water 12:00 the one will be by etc etc and rare Pokemon will appear so lit wick is pretty rare during the fired our your hopefully maybe going to see at least one lit wick I would assume yeah I would hope so they're doing that it's a six-hour event on Sunday 11 to 5 local times so I mean I don't have any expectations for this incense will attract more Sentret oh good but you use like I love the way that you say you have no expectations for it but I know you're going to complain about it once it's over I've made you long enough wait about the purloined event I thought that was pretty all right I mean it was poor alone there was really much to do with it but I don't remember a purloined event it was the Tuesday event not well not this week but it's it's though like every Tuesday yes every - so what was his last this last Tuesday was Magnemite I would actually say they messed up the Magnemite event there was not a lot of Magnemite but the purloined were everywhere and I did do the purloined event y'all know I didn't do that Magnemite a bit but you know ever everywhere purloined were everywhere and Magnemite not everywhere so I'm not sure what the difference was for that I think this week is Wobbuffet so we'll see okay that more exciting stuff Abra community today rescheduled Saturday April 25th it'll be six hours long they're calling it this is me antics words we'd like to introduce you to community day play at home edition hmm which i think is important because they're telling me that I'm going to hopefully get thee so for the safari zone event which I did at home for st. Louis I thought it was good I said this I'm sure it was recorded somewhere on some podcast I thought it was good but I did think that because I didn't go out and about like Greg I was at a disadvantage and not seeing stuff my expectations are hopefully this will be better hopefully they've used the events up to this point the purloined the Magnemite the incense days whatever else they've done and hopefully people who are playing at home feel like they did it because that's what you want yeah so that's my expectation what people want is a hundred shiny Abra so as long as they get a hundred shiny amber then they will be happy okay sure that's why I'm going for 100 shiny Abra Saturday April 25th 11:00 to 5:00 local time 6-hour event Abra will appear more frequently in the wild if you're lucky trainers you may encounter shiny Abra you can evolve Abra two hours after the event is over for Alakazam to know the exclusive move it is counter they are introducing in a dollar community day exclusive special research story called investigating illusions for one dollar let me sell you on this for one got it okay you can get 13,000 Stardust ape often a rocket radar and quote other rewards I don't know what those are rocket radar I think is normal 2 bucks puffins is normally $1.00 Stardust doesn't really have a price but you like powering a pokemon that's probably important to you they take it to the special research not refundable and then the antic on their website Pokemon go live calm says we're continuing to prioritize the Pokemon go experience here are some temporary things we were changing for again what they say is community day play at home edition it will run 6 hours and sub-3 there will be a three times sketch Stardust bonus news of the two so I would use your Stardust thing if you have it ler modules will last three hours for the duration of the event you only have to use two to cover the entire event if you're gonna play for six hours straight buddy Pokemon of a buddy level great buddy or high we'll bring you helpful items throughout the event such as pokeballs so if you have a great buddy make sure that you have them equipped not not probably the best time to start a new buddy I think great buddy is two-star which is about seven days with the buddy so get it I'm hopefully by now if you're listening to this you have at least one great buddy there will be a one-time special purchase if you want called the abre community bundle it'll have an elite charge TM 30 ultra balls three super incubators and then three in cents for twelve hundred and eighty pokey coins I got a couple problems with this number one why is it 1280 why just make it twelve number two it's complete ripoff so don't even bother buying it taxes and then they said take a snapshot during community day event for a surprise okay so there's no price on pokeball there's no price on ultra balls super incubators what are they two bucks so if we're assuming that you know super incubators if you're paying for super incubators full price that's six bucks in cents is 80 cents if you're paying that full price that's uh which no one is for any of these items that's 240 so for eight dollars it around it and we round it for eight bucks then you're paying four dollars for a item an elite charge TM that lets you change and guarantee a move on a Pokemon including legacy moves it's just it's really it's really pay to win competitive wise maybe it's maybe it's I don't know I mean to get a competitive Pokemon for Pokemon go battle league yeah for example you can't you can't get Shadow Ball on me - but Shadow Ball is the go-to on Mewtwo so are you willing to pay 12 bucks get your super incubators get your incense and then get your shadow ball on your Mewtwo no the answer is No some people users know yeah well you know you want to win I guess yeah I don't mmm sure so I I personally think it's a ripoff I get it if you're in a PvP probably an investment for you but I gave you my thoughts on PvP last week I want to like it I want them to be better I don't think this is the right step but the positive note is I do think that 99 cents I do think that's fun I do think that's that's worth it I feel like if you don't pay the dollar you're not missing out if you do pay the dollar it's literally a dollar you do get some bonuses with that I will be buying the dollar I will also be streaming and playing the community day at home in my office for the six hours on Twitch so if you want to also do commute this will be cool for for people who do watch on Twitter people who want to do community with somebody if you haven't watched on Twitch twitch.tv slash P cam and guests will have a bunch of people also doing community together so it'll be fun to see people react and say they got Chinese hopefully I get a shiny just somebody to talk to I mean we all we've kind of expressed over the years of this podcast community is better with people yup you want to join us on Twitch this Saturday I'll be streaming it whole event we'll see if it's good well I hope the antic does good I am very excited yes they getting up at 10:00 so you can do your turnips no turn this is Saturday oh this is a tree so we don't have to worry about the turnip stuff I mean I'm Mac's dad look I think I'm done with turnips I'm twelve million dollars in the bank with Animal Crossing house paid off everything paid off twelve million dollars I will probably maybe just buy one one I had to do five town runs just to sell them all this past week so I think

I'm not getting any gifts off of it I use if in around 10 30 miles an hour no I can't I'm I don't go that fast sure you have adventurous income yeah why wouldn't I if it's been on for years time that oughta turned itself off why why would you do this to play no health kit has to ask every 48 hours whether you're ok with things activating help get I I'm using my pokeball plus and it's not picking up any talk about Plus does not work with adventure sick adventure sick is primarily based off health kit on iOS and Google Google fit on the other thing Android dagnabbit adventure sync was off oh oh I told you I mean as long as it has the checkmark next to it isn't that all you need check mark next to it yeah under vest of interesting a guy who was off yeah I didn't have a check mark next he goes like and I think is I'm not getting gifts to send to people and a pokeball plus should be grabbing gifts for me so the thing is Ramirez oh c'mon from it and didn't remember if yes it possible you know on the poke ball in it number two is if the pokeball plus locks on to a Pokemon it will try to catch that Pokemon and not Auto spin a stop so if you specifically just want to ride your bike and have it spin stops turn off the catch pokemon feature and then it will only focus on stops but you can turn that a wife so once you sync it scroll down into your settings where adventure to I L my life just got a thousand let me find this setting turn off nearby Pokemon woof there you go everybody everybody's getting gifts from bday maka Scott I cannot wait till next week where you say that I fixed all your problems no that's not confessed never I've got more problems than you'll ever be able to tackle buddy we're never gonna get to that one alright last Pokemon go news here is I'm gonna pull this off Pokemon comm battle in raids at home and getting research by test powerup your buddy Pokemon faster the all-new raid remote raid pass you'll be able to join any ray battle that you can see on

faster Pokemon power-ups this update within this update which is live now you'll be able to give Pokemon all the candy and start us you needed for the desired CP level at once all this means is instead of doing one boost at a time you can say I want to boost this pokemon like ten times which is awesome activate multiple items at a time star pieces lucky eggs in sense normally lasts 30 minutes but with this update you'll be able to activate more of these items before before they are worn off allowing you to extend the duration you'll be able able to activate up to 200 of each item at a time Wow for whatever reason it'll disappear from your bag cannot be refunded so be careful don't activate too many so yeah a lot of quality of life changes I mean I can see a lot of gyms and they're saying anything I can tap on anything the light touches is my rate is what we're just I mean ideally I'm able to do a level threes solo up to level 3 level 4 I would probably need another 40 with me and Irene is not 40 and Irene does enough Pokemon but you know if I if I'm seeing a clink or something down the street it would you know pass it on by it would be nice to just do that from the comfort of my bed man I wish I lived back in DC again all them raid gym so maybe they fill my house there's a lot for my house remote ride passes will be able to buy individually at a special discounted price of a hundred coins I don't have a hundred coins I also they increased the storage so instead of two thousand five hundred items you can all you can now hold up to three thousand items for however much that cost to upgrade I think ten dollars a doof fifty for two dollars time's doing that 10 times $20 to upgrade your storage from 2500 to 3000 okay there is a Pokemon home maintenance

hopefully it means something better is coming in the future and they didn't forget that Pokemon home is a service that we're paying or not for $60 a year for I haven't even started really leveraging it yet I haven't finished my pokemon sword pokedex yet I have to like there are so many things I have to move but huh it all seems so hard yeah having a mom agree yeah sixty pokemon away from the gear nah I have so many things and all me other games and I never moved them up the bank and then I think oh I just sit down and do that and then I'm like it's gonna take like three hours and I I don't know I got I got turnips to worry about turnips and all my villagers are trying to leave me and I do nice things for them great question the week oh we're here huh ready hey now what's the question what's the question of the week there's time left in the podcast so let's see what you all ask is that supposed to be an iron ulcer yeah that's opposed to be rude now now now that you said it I can hear it it's ass Craig you're more of a tenor than a bear I am I always have been shout out to Chris or the original stitch stuff posted in the attic channel that we talked about this question is from Casey which of the side games do you like the most and which ones would you like to see come back for example game corners contest Rotom rally or even one's mentioned never explored like Rhyhorn racing oh yeah that was a next time only thing they talked about minigames you mean not side yeah I was like okay Ranger but that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about the games within the game pokey star studios don't you start yeah it's bad liar liar liar liar I I'm not a huge fan of Rotom rally I do like contests contracts or musicals I think I want musicals back hmm hate myself for saying this oh yeah a redeeming feature of heartgold SoulSilver you are not gonna go to the pokey Athlon pokey etholon was not awful so garbage the rewards were garbage some of the garbage oh yeah you have to like cut off your arm and sell it to the hiker in order to get some stone in that game but the while the minigames were fun but then you just had the the huge amount of disappointment when you came in first place and they gave you like two coins for first place and then you walk over to go like I really need a Sunstone and it's like oh it's only 2000 and you're like well I like it I don't know if I like to do this a thousand more times in a row but I really need to involve that sunflora for my pokedex now that what you're saying means nothing to me as I almost have 999 of every berry possible in a Lola so here I gotta put your words to your teeth what was your favorite polka Athlon event go you have three seconds to name it off the top of your I don't know the names of them what was it based off of you know what sports are oh gosh the the track and field one was pretty good or you had to run and jump there was the one - there was the one where you were jumping off the trampolines I think and collecting stuff that one's pretty alright there was oh they're the coolest one which is also the most frustrating one was like there was it wasn't it wasn't like the brooms and the things moving over but you had to was it what do they call that brooms and then the giant discs that you had to put her away earlier it was kind of like cooling you're talking about there's like a curling esque one that's pretty good you know how hard it is to get into a curling club here in Minneapolis it pours yes they are full you cannot curl if you want desperately need to curl for your life so okay which okay I'm I'm on the page was are you talking about was the trampoline one lamp jump that sounds right okay then the curling one the curling one is is it the no not rigged drop oh it's a it's circle pushed circle push it like that one circle push was pretty good goal roll also not bad these names are I just saw these names there okay here's can we go can we go outside the question this is the thing that would be very cool another thing heartgold SoulSilver little gold and silver very unique to the johto region probably somebody's favorite anytime somebody is like oh my favorite game is hard cold still silver my favorite game is gold and silver they never bring this up this is a valid reason though if they were to tell me this is why they're the their games are their favorite the buck caching contest is it rigged yes but yes it's rigged it's like that that would be like those kind of contests especially in a game you know now that not that every video game in the world is like a living game and has these these events and that's literally the only thing to really look forward to now in Animal Crossing is what event is coming up next but if you know yeah cuz you gobbled it up so you got because you got twelve million bells here and sharing it just like Bezos in a you know future Pokemon game if like every Saturday there was a fishing contest or a bug catching contest or a fossil finding contest of like dig a bunch of holes and whoever finds the biggest Nana Ruth wins Vera finds the biggest hole wins I would see ya like it'd be fun to have like weekly events I think it'd be fun to have it in the wild area be like like an alternate form of versus battle where like everybody's connected in the wild there yet but connect to the Internet and then there's like a weird global ranking that would be fun well yeah like you can run up to people and be like our eyes met time to battle and prepare to get pwned my answer for this question of the week is the little minigames in pokemon black and white where you could go and visit while your friend was playing locally you could go and visit their world and you had little tasks that you had to complete in order to gain points that that was fun it was a lot of fun because it would be a thing now you'd go to the the tree in the middle on on tree on tree now in the middle on tree it's also where you would go to collect like if you had caught Pokemon in the dream world you dare to come up but then from the on tree you could basically it was like basically entering the dream world was entering your friends game you would either go over the bridge on the right or over the bridge on the left yeah find your friend in the game and give them an apple and then like that I mean it's just like it's so it was like such fueled my imagination that I was literally visiting their Pokemon world that one was very good I would do that again especially now that we have a much stronger internet braid area that sing that absolutely will you want to wrap it up with the Pokemon of the week I mean do I want to not really will you a hard work for very little reward welcome to America last week's Pokemon it was a poem I'll just repeat the poem for you because it just makes it very clear what the Pokemon is poems title is I do not like that Pokemon I do not like it in the air I do not like it in the snow I do not like that Pokemon whose name is like avocado I do not like the power of one I do not like it under pressure I do not like it with a snow cloak I do not like it's five foot seven measure I will not catch it in seafoam Islands I cannot hatch it from an egg I will not catch it on cliff world I will not catch it if you beg I do not like that Pokemon no matter what you say I will not catch that Pokemon that could be found on Mount sorbet all right Greg I know you know who this is [Music] sandé akanda you are the worst it's Articuno no it's chatot sorry Steve would have been right this week just gone with chatot yes it's Articuno Articuno is found in the seafoam Islands folks it has he soft reset like a thousand times trying to get it I did 7000 in the second episode of the anime there's an engravement in the wall in Viridian city it depicts the legendary birds ash mistakes heart Articuno as the engraving as the ho-oh he saw in episode 1 the blue color of the stones in the case ice type and the wings and crest feathers on those Articuno multiple tails look nothing like Articuno scale being more similar in the appearance of those two how Oh what are you gonna do would love to know if that was like intentional or not like is ash just dumb because he just started his journey and just said like oh that looked like the Pokemon I saw I feel like that's like an easy mistake that anyone would make he doesn't know what he saw now he sees this engraving of a Pokemon that he also doesn't know that's also a bird yes yeah oh and also Greg yes I do like Articuno but earlier on the day that I wrote this I had seen it was a take on green eggs and ham but it was from a Magic the Gathering meme group about Oh ristic study I was like yeah will you pay it [Laughter] that's a little MTG joke for you insiders in red blue yellow as well as firered/leafgreen there are binoculars in the gates separating fuchsia city from route 15 through which Articuno can be seen flying towards the sea it is visible if the binoculars even it is it is still visible in the monoculars even if you've already captured or defeated Articuno in seafoam islands this the other Articuno yeah yeah and i mean it's just like in let's go yeah you can fly around and still catch more legendary birds yeah they're they're everywhere okay I make it the Articuno original stitch shirt terrific in the opening of spring fever Todd points out a tall mountain that is art akunis home this mountain is on the outside the same as ice Island which is art akunis home featured in the power of one also mentioned in my poem mmm-hmm in pokemon mystery dungeon explorers of time and explorers of darkness this is the only one in where the trio cannot be encountered unless the player enters an event password Articuno is the last genuine Pokemon to be introduced in the anime and the only one that did not appear in season one if the movies and banned episodes are included mu is the last to be a mu it is the last of its appearance in the movies if the movies are not counted obviously mu was in the Mewtwo movie Articuno is the only other Pokemon bus then smeargle and Poliwrath that is able to learn an accuracy focusing move and a one-hit ko move learning mine reader and shield sheer cold an article using this combination can be fought in the battle subway black and white strikes again yep you know my best gen like Articuno it's alright I love Articuno until you have to soft reset no I saw force edit any of those birds and let's go I already had them all in Pokemon go so you'd have an opportunity to talk to people it's true still not shiny Mewtwo though gotta work on that alright you ready for this week's pokum I am so this one an extra clue I actually learned it and stole it a little bit little cross-promotion from another podcast that Greg does Greg's gonna get it immediately unless his memory is real bad my memory is all right here we go according to Wikipedia lasats were a humanoid sentient species native to the wild space planet leiris on additionally they had settled the outer rim world of las' on which for quite some time was thought to be the only world they inhabited lasats speak a language called Lizotte of which we currently know four words Ashla meaning the force bogan potentially used to describe annoying creatures ash buh meaning steady or balanced their fourth word is an exclamation used in moments of crisis potentially an expletive it also sounds similar to although not exactly the same as this week's Pokemon while it is not a mechanical Pokemon this week's pokémon requires both electrical stimulation and another pokemons presence to evolve this is most likely why this Pokemon can be found near charged stone cave worldwide this Pokemon was part of a distribution event in 2011 while it was distributed in English it was not distributed in the United States there you go Greg do you know what already I know it already that's our show we will be back next week again if you want to do the leave a review donate 25 cents to Meals on Wheels that'll be in the show notes or you can just go to pot chaser calm and search for its
