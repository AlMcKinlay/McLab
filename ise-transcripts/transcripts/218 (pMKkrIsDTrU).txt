episode of the Pokemon podcast i'm your (0:24 - 0:31)
host SBJ and to my left is Travis I'm (0:27 - 0:33)
cheer left I didn't know there were (0:31 - 0:36)
doing are we doing video I remember to (0:33 - 0:41)
turn on my mother's the video you're (0:36 - 0:43)
getting me off the rails and were like (0:41 - 0:45)
hardly even like two seconds into this (0:43 - 0:48)
we haven't even gotten on the rails no (0:45 - 0:52)
to my right is will well since we're (0:48 - 0:53)
sitting in the dark i'm actually on your (0:52 - 0:56)
left Travis and I switch places without (0:53 - 0:58)
you telling you ah ok so are the rails (0:56 - 1:00)
that's why I was all confused because (0:58 - 1:02)
it's which happened so quick oh you want (1:00 - 1:04)
to talk about confusing talk about well (1:02 - 1:05)
I'm not even to talk about it yet but (1:04 - 1:07)
when Steve talks about it I'm gonna talk (1:05 - 1:09)
about it and we'll talk about confusing (1:07 - 1:12)
and annoying at the same time I don't (1:09 - 1:13)
know what that means or what I'm (1:12 - 1:15)
supposed to be that'll be the mystery of (1:13 - 1:18)
the episode and when people realize what (1:15 - 1:19)
it is I think they're gonna have a light (1:18 - 1:21)
bulb go off and there there my time (1:19 - 1:23)
giving them a story moment I see as a (1:21 - 1:27)
gift this episode feels already really (1:23 - 1:30)
foreign to me because for the last like (1:27 - 1:33)
three weeks we have either recorded on a (1:30 - 1:35)
thursday or we have recorded some (1:33 - 1:37)
version of that live and now we're like (1:35 - 1:40)
back to our sunday schedule at noon (1:37 - 1:43)
central time is that what time it is (1:40 - 1:45)
because i just woke up your nap a (1:43 - 1:48)
hundred my nap yeah that's where it is (1:45 - 1:51)
the tour it is we get some oh we got (1:48 - 1:53)
some Pokemon needs to go through and (1:51 - 1:55)
some other stuff to talk about but (1:53 - 1:57)
before we get to that how was your (1:55 - 2:00)
guys's week well what's what's new in (1:57 - 2:04)
the life of DC it's really really hot um (2:00 - 2:05)
which is probably the same for a lot of (2:04 - 2:08)
places but see him given that like a (2:05 - 2:10)
week ago it was really cold I'm not (2:08 - 2:12)
dealing with this particularly well and (2:10 - 2:16)
I as I was supposed to run seven miles (2:12 - 2:18)
this morning but it was so hot that I (2:16 - 2:20)
only ran six miles and I hate myself now (2:18 - 2:22)
and I'll never forgive myself for (2:20 - 2:25)
missing that one last mile and I tried (2:22 - 2:27)
to build a different vanguard deck from (2:25 - 2:29)
the one I've been using a lot lately and (2:27 - 2:31)
I'm haven't been able to so its failures (2:29 - 2:33)
all around speaking speaking of (2:31 - 2:35)
anger and how's how's your are you say (2:33 - 2:38)
speaking of failures all around Travis (2:35 - 2:42)
haha I don't have that good transitions (2:38 - 2:44)
Travis you giving me too much credit i (2:42 - 2:46)
giveth I was gonna ask well how his (2:44 - 2:49)
other podcast is doing your Vanguard (2:46 - 2:51)
podcast it seems to be doing good we hit (2:49 - 2:53)
episode 10 we had we interviewed a (2:51 - 2:56)
writer for alter reality games on (2:53 - 2:58)
episode 10 which I'm trying to do like (2:56 - 3:02)
some format stuff where every 5 episode (2:58 - 3:06)
is about what does that call what it's (3:02 - 3:08)
like the stories in the background of (3:06 - 3:09)
the cards and things like that not (3:08 - 3:11)
necessarily the case like American water (3:09 - 3:15)
the lower lower larocca so every five (3:11 - 3:17)
episodes of the lore episode every 10 (3:15 - 3:20)
episode is an interview episode so we (3:17 - 3:22)
just did an interview episode so for the (3:20 - 3:24)
first ten episodes I've held to that (3:22 - 3:28)
grand plan and and we do have listeners (3:24 - 3:31)
and we do get the occasional feedback so (3:28 - 3:33)
I'm even listeners who don't play (3:31 - 3:36)
Vanguard which um yeah what thumbs up I (3:33 - 3:41)
appreciate it even though we really only (3:36 - 3:45)

alive we're doing noteworthy in the (4:01 - 4:06)
games section oh yeah such that's your (4:03 - 4:09)
time to advertise we're not advertise (4:06 - 4:11)
but make sure like you're putting your (4:09 - 4:15)
strongest content forward the strongest (4:11 - 4:19)
content debatable the best content we (4:15 - 4:22)
can manage to offer truth okay all right (4:19 - 4:25)
Travis what's new well I'm glad to hear (4:22 - 4:28)
from will but one week I was actually in (4:25 - 4:30)
Washington DC was the week that it was (4:28 - 4:33)
cold and immediately after I left is (4:30 - 4:35)
trying to get warm again that is cold (4:33 - 4:39)
and rainy ha I'm starting to think that (4:35 - 4:43)
I'm not always cold just because I live (4:39 - 4:44)
in Michigan but be (4:43 - 4:48)
cuz my negative attitude about the world (4:44 - 4:51)
around me changes it in a sort of storm (4:48 - 4:55)
like way like that the hip x-man that (4:51 - 4:58)
that's it that's that's hitting theaters (4:55 - 5:01)
she changes and water I just make it (4:58 - 5:06)
gloomy and terrible I was in like last (5:01 - 5:11)
weekend I was in Columbus Ohio for rock (5:06 - 5:15)
on the range was a music festival and (5:11 - 5:17)
between the buried and me and at the (5:15 - 5:20)
drive-in and the sword were all (5:17 - 5:23)
unbelievable and part of me but it's (5:20 - 5:25)
2016 I believe we can use the term X (5:23 - 5:30)
person the movie that is excellent it's (5:25 - 5:32)
against as much as much as I would (5:30 - 5:37)
prefer that the movie were called uh X (5:32 - 5:41)
folks which is like way about her that (5:37 - 5:43)
agree a dogs out of all the word that's (5:41 - 5:45)
the one you're gonna go with folks so (5:43 - 5:48)
hey folks all the time okay all right I (5:45 - 5:51)
am part of a dbag unity called the (5:48 - 5:53)
inclusion society and we have managed to (5:51 - 5:56)
hack a number of AMC and other brand (5:53 - 5:57)
movie theaters so that all their digital (5:56 - 6:00)
displays say X people and if we find a (5:57 - 6:05)
physical display it says x-men we go in (6:00 - 6:06)
the middle of the night and we replace (6:05 - 6:09)
the letters to say X people d is that a (6:06 - 6:12)
is that like a rock do you remember i (6:09 - 6:17)
think it was in like the mid-90s when or (6:12 - 6:20)
maybe it was even before my time it was (6:17 - 6:22)
in the 80s but the what was it called it (6:20 - 6:25)
was like the Barbie liberation squadron (6:22 - 6:27)
or something will you remember this (6:25 - 6:33)
right no oh shoot well I I'm not gonna (6:27 - 6:34)
be able to get you the episode where (6:33 - 6:38)
Lisa Simpson try to design a new version (6:34 - 6:41)
of the doll I'll just assume yeah it's a (6:38 - 6:43)
modern business lady and it didn't work (6:41 - 6:46)
oh but I am a member i am a member of (6:43 - 6:49)
the actual group the crochet Liberation (6:46 - 6:53)
Front so there's there's that as opposed (6:49 - 6:54)
to the inclusion society which doesn't (6:53 - 6:55)
exist and I don't know how to hack (6:54 - 6:58)
anything except like a slice of ham (6:55 - 7:00)
why I tell the Barbie liberation (6:58 - 7:02)
squadron or front or whatever it's (7:00 - 7:04)
called story yes they do did they do (7:02 - 7:08)
let's hear a was some some particular (7:04 - 7:13)
Barbie like many of them where it was (7:08 - 7:15)
very specific like it was it was a (7:13 - 7:18)
talking barbie and it was all like I (7:15 - 7:20)
love to go shopping and cook because (7:18 - 7:22)
those are the only things that women are (7:20 - 7:23)
allowed to do right like he was saying (7:22 - 7:27)
very the gender roles were being (7:23 - 7:30)
reinforced in this Barbie so what this (7:27 - 7:32)
this group did is they went and they (7:30 - 7:34)
would open up the back of the toys there (7:32 - 7:36)
take out the voice box and swap it with (7:34 - 7:40)
the voice voice box of the GI Joe toy (7:36 - 7:42)
that was out at the same time so you (7:40 - 7:44)
would buy the Barbie and it would be (7:42 - 7:47)
like good to the frontline the enemy's a (7:44 - 7:49)
year now and then you would buy the GI (7:47 - 7:52)
Joe it would be like I love shopping and (7:49 - 7:57)
uh moms across all of the Midwest i (7:52 - 7:59)
assume is where it happened because (7:57 - 8:01)
that's where moms get angry moms across (7:59 - 8:04)
all of them it was for furious that (8:01 - 8:06)
their their poor children were being (8:04 - 8:09)
subjected to women who don't like (8:06 - 8:14)
shopping I guess hmm but if it reminds (8:09 - 8:16)
me a lot of that lisa simpson episode (8:14 - 8:19)
that will road up yeah I do remember the (8:16 - 8:21)
Cabbage Patch Kid riots of the 80s but (8:19 - 8:25)
barberia liberation I do not speaking of (8:21 - 8:28)
Barbie liberation i liberated some (8:25 - 8:32)
aliens in a game called stellaris which (8:28 - 8:36)

support their games for super long time (11:41 - 11:45)
so they've already rolled out a couple (11:43 - 11:47)
major update you don't even know what (11:45 - 11:48)
other games they've made and yet you (11:47 - 11:50)
know that they support their games for a (11:48 - 11:53)
long time I could look it up I've played (11:50 - 11:56)
some of their other games and when you (11:53 - 11:58)
read a bunch of stellaris news Travis (11:56 - 12:00)

games for a long time so I just took (12:00 - 12:06)
that and rehashed it here and what (12:02 - 12:08)
podcast but I think that's a classic (12:06 - 12:11)
theme of it's super effective rehashing (12:08 - 12:15)

rehashing other people's news welcome to (12:15 - 12:23)

babies episode a let's talk about (12:23 - 12:29)
inspiration organization was in 1993 um (12:25 - 12:33)
and they replaced 300 to 500 dolls with (12:29 - 12:37)
the voice box of GI Joes we get it all (12:33 - 12:40)
we all facts right in about 10 minutes (12:37 - 12:42)
Travis will bring up what games paradox (12:40 - 12:44)
is made and then we'll make another (12:42 - 12:47)
reference also bring up what elephants (12:44 - 12:49)
do all right good i like i like this (12:47 - 12:52)
format of us mentioning stuff we're not (12:49 - 12:53)
knowledgeable about and then you (12:52 - 12:57)
correcting us several minutes later i'll (12:53 - 12:59)
warn everybody my two pokemon are about (12:57 - 13:02)
to get into a battle and and it's gonna (12:59 - 13:05)
be an auditory nightmare for everyone (13:02 - 13:08)
when it happens I don't know what that (13:05 - 13:11)
means but my cat is on the floor my dog (13:08 - 13:13)
is up on the bed the cat's about to jump (13:11 - 13:14)
up and scratch the dog in some way (13:13 - 13:18)
alright likes to do it's like you have (13:14 - 13:20)
pokemon go in your house right now and (13:18 - 13:24)
us field testing for Pokemon go is now (13:20 - 13:26)
alive (13:24 - 13:30)
you are like the five people they chose (13:26 - 13:33)
in the u.s. to pick all of them Greg's (13:30 - 13:38)
right like a judge or anything poke (13:33 - 13:39)
mango features more than a hundred (13:38 - 13:41)
catchable Pokemon I don't know if you (13:39 - 13:43)
guys knew that but that is a that was (13:41 - 13:45)
recently stated in their last press (13:43 - 13:49)
release number like that's not generally (13:45 - 13:52)
like it's just generation one right from (13:49 - 13:54)
everything I've seen I've only seen (13:52 - 13:56)
Pokemon from generation one that's a (13:54 - 13:58)
grand even the roster I mean like unless (13:56 - 14:04)
by more than 100 they mean 151 probably (13:58 - 14:06)
what they do do we should actually look (14:04 - 14:08)
at early marketing materials for (14:06 - 14:10)
original pokemon and it probably says (14:08 - 14:13)
over 100 catchable Pokemon well I (14:10 - 14:18)
mattress to see well my guess would be (14:13 - 14:22)
it's all 150 minus legendaries and (14:18 - 14:24)
mythical so then it would be weird to (14:22 - 14:27)
say like there's a hundred and thirty (14:24 - 14:29)
catchable Pokemon are you supposed to (14:27 - 14:32)
get the I refuse to make the distinction (14:29 - 14:38)
from legendary mythical are you supposed (14:32 - 14:40)
to find legendaries then I would they (14:38 - 14:42)
would probably roll those out from like (14:40 - 14:46)
a get your get your zapdos at target how (14:42 - 14:48)
would i would assume those were open on (14:46 - 14:50)
the Rock of Gibraltar if you want (14:48 - 14:53)
yourself or regigigas soap oh c'mon Go (14:50 - 14:56)
field testing now live I don't know (14:53 - 14:59)
anyone personally that got access to it (14:56 - 15:02)
will did you say you knew some people no (14:59 - 15:04)
I said that Greg's friends all got (15:02 - 15:08)
access to it gamemaster Greg game (15:04 - 15:11)
dungeon master dungeon master gray well (15:08 - 15:14)
depends technicalities that's true (15:11 - 15:17)
you're not wrong I have feet i I just I (15:14 - 15:19)
just the hashtag searched Pokemon go on (15:17 - 15:24)
on Twitter and found a mostly people (15:19 - 15:26)
mostly people complaining that they (15:24 - 15:28)
didn't have access to Pokemon go but a (15:26 - 15:31)
couple people dating they did I don't I (15:28 - 15:34)
don't know like the the announced the I (15:31 - 15:36)
I can (15:34 - 15:39)
say on one end I'm like slightly (15:36 - 15:42)
disappointed that I didn't get access to (15:39 - 15:44)
the beta and i'm not sure if codes are (15:42 - 15:47)
still going out or not probably not on (15:44 - 15:49)
the other end i burned through mobile (15:47 - 15:51)
games pretty quickly so i don't know if (15:49 - 15:56)
it would be so in depth or so engaging (15:51 - 15:58)
that like i would burn through it and (15:56 - 15:59)
then when it actually comes out i would (15:58 - 16:02)
i would be disappointed and then I'm (15:59 - 16:03)
really doesn't help that you were (16:02 - 16:05)
calling ingress a terrible game on (16:03 - 16:08)
Twitter yeah are you still playing clash (16:05 - 16:10)
Royale uh yeah I am still playing clash (16:08 - 16:14)
Royale but not not as much as when I was (16:10 - 16:16)
on The Clash hi so you are a game (16:14 - 16:19)
cobbler yeah yeah up the element in the (16:16 - 16:23)
game game gobbler the I the other thing (16:19 - 16:25)
that kind of bothers me is I'm not a big (16:23 - 16:27)
fan of betas we're like hey put eight (16:25 - 16:29)
hours into this and now you just lost it (16:27 - 16:30)
all because it's not the official game I (16:29 - 16:33)
mean I get it that's what a beta is but (16:30 - 16:34)
some people like that some people don't (16:33 - 16:38)
I'm I I can usually hold up and wait (16:34 - 16:41)
it's it's hilarious cuz how long ago did (16:38 - 16:44)
Pokemon shuffle come out probably over (16:41 - 16:46)
Pokemon shuffle has been the only (16:44 - 16:48)
pokemon game we've talked about in this (16:46 - 16:50)
pokemon podcast for like missed three (16:48 - 16:53)
years well it hasn't been three years so (16:50 - 16:55)
much shuffle is just over a year old now (16:53 - 16:57)
is it not so yeah so see that's the (16:55 - 17:00)
difference between you and me is I guess (16:57 - 17:02)
it's a little over a year old I only (17:00 - 17:04)
stopped playing shuffle every single day (17:02 - 17:08)
on Monday of last week so I don't burn (17:04 - 17:11)
out on mobile games or any kind of game (17:08 - 17:13)
unless life presents a change that (17:11 - 17:15)
forces me to stop playing it you know I (17:13 - 17:18)
almost turned on Pokemon shuffle the (17:15 - 17:22)
other day and the reason I didn't was (17:18 - 17:24)
because I was a Nintendo badger kid Oh (17:22 - 17:28)
which that's another part of news and I (17:24 - 17:31)
didn't want to close Nintendo badge (17:28 - 17:33)
arcade wait for shuffle to open and then (17:31 - 17:35)
know that later that night i would go (17:33 - 17:38)
back into the Nintendo badger kid so (17:35 - 17:41)
flow shuffle wait for badger kid to open (17:38 - 17:44)
at wow no seriously like that that was (17:41 - 17:48)
my take that long they want to play a (17:44 - 17:50)
game called the Badger (17:48 - 17:55)
they're what's that about there it (17:50 - 17:58)
there's something satisfying about (17:55 - 18:01)
opening your 3ds and the game already (17:58 - 18:05)
being right there with no load like that (18:01 - 18:09)
is what I strive for instance we go (18:05 - 18:13)
c'mon podcast to not play pokemon I mean (18:09 - 18:15)
I I played all kinds of games and I just (18:13 - 18:17)
switch between them like a regular (18:15 - 18:19)
patient person but I'm not a game (18:17 - 18:21)
gobbler as I just proved but you have to (18:19 - 18:24)
wait for the game to close and open and (18:21 - 18:27)
it's like 30 seconds no one is with you (18:24 - 18:31)
alright that's that's very intense (18:27 - 18:34)
Nintendo badger cave there are Pokemon (18:31 - 18:37)
badges in it if any of you have either (18:34 - 18:39)
of you played Nintendo Patrick you don't (18:37 - 18:41)
really play Nintendo fat jerk it let's (18:39 - 18:43)
get out that of the way yeah that's just (18:41 - 18:44)
from what I understand that's just a (18:43 - 18:47)
huge money sock yep we up right there's (18:44 - 18:48)
no point way to play about spending (18:47 - 18:51)
money on it no there's totally a way to (18:48 - 18:53)
play with without spending money i mean (18:51 - 18:56)
they give you one free play every day (18:53 - 18:58)
well sometimes you can get two or three (18:56 - 19:00)
plays but like by default you're always (18:58 - 19:03)
gonna get one free play every day well I (19:00 - 19:06)
can't fuel any more addictions to daily (19:03 - 19:09)
play games so now so far far listeners (19:06 - 19:11)
that might not be familiar Nintendo (19:09 - 19:14)
badger kid came out oh man when did that (19:11 - 19:16)
come out like right before Christmas of (19:14 - 19:18)
last year i think and i think in (19:16 - 19:22)
november and badges it's like our news (19:18 - 19:24)
is going into news well have some news (19:22 - 19:27)
about like badges / pins later on but (19:24 - 19:32)
these are digital badges that all they (19:27 - 19:34)
do is they either sit in your collection (19:32 - 19:37)
in Nintendo badger arcade or what you (19:34 - 19:38)
can do is you can put these badges on (19:37 - 19:41)
your home screen on your 3ds and like (19:38 - 19:42)
arrange them in different ways you can (19:41 - 19:44)
also like if you have a folder you could (19:42 - 19:46)
put the badge on top of the folder so (19:44 - 19:48)
instead of just having a blue folder you (19:46 - 19:50)
can have like an image of like a tran (19:48 - 19:54)
older what's that a megaman folder yeah (19:50 - 19:55)
you could have a megaman folder you can (19:54 - 19:57)
put Isabelle on a folder or something (19:55 - 20:00)
the last thing you can do is some of the (19:57 - 20:04)
icons like look like what was (20:00 - 20:06)
what was that girl that got banned (20:04 - 20:12)
Swapnote girl Nikki what remember (20:06 - 20:14)
Swapnote I'm 3d us that it got like I do (20:12 - 20:16)
you remember Swapnote you got is so (20:14 - 20:19)
salty that it's gone they got banned but (20:16 - 20:21)
like there were Nikki badges and like (20:19 - 20:24)
there was like a wrench in the form of (20:21 - 20:26)
like the nikki art style and so you (20:24 - 20:28)
could make that wrench be your Settings (20:26 - 20:31)
button so those are like your three (20:28 - 20:33)
extents you do nothing with the badges (20:31 - 20:35)
you put them on your home screen or you (20:33 - 20:37)
turn them into like utility things like (20:35 - 20:41)
like a settings folder so when you first (20:37 - 20:42)
get into bed your kid you I think you (20:41 - 20:45)
get like five free plays and it is it is (20:42 - 20:47)
the claw game that's all it is you you (20:45 - 20:50)
the only button you press is a you hold (20:47 - 20:53)
down a to move the claw and then you let (20:50 - 20:55)
go of a and the claw does it's grabbing (20:53 - 20:58)
claw thing picks up a badge sometimes (20:55 - 21:00)
pulls it up most of the time does not (20:58 - 21:03)
pull it up and then if it drops it into (21:00 - 21:07)
the the whole you get the badge and it's (21:03 - 21:10)
your badge forever where the the (21:07 - 21:12)
free-to-play thing comes in is there's a (21:10 - 21:15)
practice catcher where you get you get (21:12 - 21:17)
like seven or eight claw things and (21:15 - 21:20)
you're driving practice badges and (21:17 - 21:22)
and when when the badges like flip over (21:20 - 21:24)
at the end if there's like a free play (21:22 - 21:26)
on the back of the badge that's that's (21:24 - 21:28)
how you get free plays for the real (21:26 - 21:29)
catcher and most of the time you collect (21:28 - 21:31)
like seven badges and it goes oh there's (21:29 - 21:33)
no free plays in the back of these oh (21:31 - 21:35)
well but since you played here's your (21:33 - 21:38)
free play so like always by default you (21:35 - 21:41)
get free play um but the trick is (21:38 - 21:43)
there's a couple tricks so if you just (21:41 - 21:45)
go through all the levels of badges (21:43 - 21:48)
sometimes like by i don't know like (21:45 - 21:50)
going through the machine like it kind (21:48 - 21:52)
of shakes the stage and sometimes a (21:50 - 21:55)
badge will like roll off the edge and (21:52 - 21:57)
you get a free badge just by like seeing (21:55 - 22:00)
what badges are there I think it's just (21:57 - 22:03)
their way of like here's a two percent (22:00 - 22:04)
chance of if you looked at all our play (22:03 - 22:08)
boards you get it but then so the actual (22:04 - 22:11)
price is you get five plays if i'm not (22:08 - 22:15)
mistaken for a dollar and then ten plays (22:11 - 22:17)
for two dollars three plays for fifteen (22:15 - 22:18)
they don't give you like an it like I (22:17 - 22:20)
feel like if you're paying more money (22:18 - 22:22)
you should get more plays but it's it's (22:20 - 22:25)
one play / it's five plays / a dollar (22:22 - 22:27)
and the reason I'm talking about nitendo (22:25 - 22:29)
badger kate is because there's been a (22:27 - 22:32)
bunch of Pokemon badges the last week or (22:29 - 22:35)
two well I was just gonna say you're (22:32 - 22:37)
saying that but aren't there like 300 (22:35 - 22:39)
Pokemon badges oh yeah yeah at least I (22:37 - 22:41)
put I put money in cuz I was like I'll (22:39 - 22:43)
just you know what what is what is ten (22:41 - 22:45)
dollars to get a bunch of Pokemon badges (22:43 - 22:48)
no they keep coming I'm I can't do it (22:45 - 22:50)
anymore there's just too many badges (22:48 - 22:52)
there's way too many badges like if you (22:50 - 22:54)
go to bulbapedia right now and you look (22:52 - 22:58)
at the the badge list there has to be (22:54 - 23:02)
over 200 different pokemon badges (22:58 - 23:05)
already so if out of 5 plays you get one (23:02 - 23:08)
badge that know you'd probably you could (23:05 - 23:11)
you could easily get i would say four (23:08 - 23:14)
badges purva five plays like it so it (23:11 - 23:16)
doesn't sixty dollars yeah it doesn't (23:14 - 23:18)
screw you over that badly and fifty (23:16 - 23:21)
dollars for decorations on my digital (23:18 - 23:23)
screen yep yep it's terrible i think at (23:21 - 23:24)
this point i put eight dollars in the (23:23 - 23:27)
nintendo badger kid but I have many (23:24 - 23:29)
badges how many pokemon badges you have (23:27 - 23:31)
out of those eight dollars out of eight (23:29 - 23:33)
dollars i probably have about forty (23:31 - 23:37)
badges all right 40 or 50 but a better (23:33 - 23:39)
video game player than i am so like it (23:37 - 23:42)
it is it because he has badges though (23:39 - 23:44)
that's right so whatever yes employee I (23:42 - 23:49)
have all the best Stevie down the street (23:44 - 23:53)
has a power glove he's so good at games (23:49 - 23:58)
badger Kade the I have no words for how (23:53 - 24:01)
we broke my friend brandon has an atari (23:58 - 24:06)
lynx it's so cool what what happens when (24:01 - 24:08)
we don't no longer have a 3 this is this (24:06 - 24:10)
is my big question what happens when the (24:08 - 24:14)
3ds goes away because I am sure there (24:10 - 24:19)
are whales people who spend (24:14 - 24:22)
hundreds of dollars and badger kid to (24:19 - 24:24)
make sure they have every single badge (24:22 - 24:28)
hmm what where did they go after the 3ds (24:24 - 24:32)
like they could be like any other 3ds (24:28 - 24:33)
game where it's like this game is tied (24:32 - 24:35)
to this council like animal crossing (24:33 - 24:38)
wild world you know that's your DS game (24:35 - 24:40)
it's not coming forward your progress is (24:38 - 24:44)
staying on the original DS but like (24:40 - 24:45)
Nintendo badger cade seems like (24:44 - 24:47)
something where it's like you're (24:45 - 24:49)
collecting these because it's a game (24:47 - 24:51)
based on collecting and we're letting (24:49 - 24:53)
them we're letting you put them on our (24:51 - 24:56)
home screen so in the other thing is (24:53 - 24:59)
it's so late in the 3ds like lineup like (24:56 - 25:01)
it's not like the 3ds launched with (24:59 - 25:03)
Nintendo badger cave like they released (25:01 - 25:05)
it less than six months ago so what (25:03 - 25:07)
happens when the 3d s is gone do you (25:05 - 25:11)
just lose all like the battle mean (25:07 - 25:12)
they're gonna introduce badge arcade (25:11 - 25:18)
bank obvious okay I don't know it's but (25:12 - 25:21)
it's just a weird thing what about all (25:18 - 25:23)
the custom backgrounds that I paid a (25:21 - 25:25)
dollar each for dollar fifty four I mean (25:23 - 25:27)
yeah you're right cuz like I'm (25:25 - 25:28)
playstation 3 you could have custom (25:27 - 25:30)
backgrounds too and those were just tied (25:28 - 25:33)
to your ps3 you can have custom (25:30 - 25:35)
backgrounds on the ps4 to it's just (25:33 - 25:36)
everybody's learned their lesson and (25:35 - 25:40)
nobody buys them yeah yes that is (25:36 - 25:44)
accurate um yeah so uh there are still (25:40 - 25:46)
as of this recording there should still (25:44 - 25:49)
be some pokemon left and put one badger (25:46 - 25:54)
kid so if you're into that thing go go (25:49 - 25:57)
nuts if you're into badgers go right (25:54 - 25:59)
ahead during the badges that jerk aid (25:57 - 26:02)
did you guys get your xerneas Eva tall (25:59 - 26:06)

there's an article just saying battling (26:15 - 26:21)
can be easy as X Y Z and pokemon calm (26:18 - 26:24)
and it just talks about the what the (26:21 - 26:26)
best use for these three pokémon are if (26:24 - 26:29)
you're interested in that turns out if (26:26 - 26:31)
you have (26:29 - 26:35)
czerny is a vocal and Zygons i guard on (26:31 - 26:40)
your team you'll do pretty well know if (26:35 - 26:41)

your team and you go to a lola there's a (26:41 - 26:45)
special cave that you can go to that (26:43 - 26:46)
will only open if you have all three of (26:45 - 26:48)
them on there and you'll get a manaphy (26:46 - 26:50)
you have a push the truck first though I (26:48 - 26:54)
said cave not well xerneas can gio man (26:50 - 26:56)
see the truck out of the way there you (26:54 - 26:57)
go how did you have to thank you at (26:56 - 27:00)
first you have to evolve your Spiro into (26:57 - 27:04)
a peak of blue it was that it's really (27:00 - 27:06)
pretty reckless or a prerequisite yeah (27:04 - 27:10)
I'll TL DR that article for you xerneas (27:06 - 27:13)
is competitive zygarde is a joke yveltal (27:10 - 27:19)
hmm not so much journey is it ok i love (27:13 - 27:22)
xerneas as a pokemon as a pokemon design (27:19 - 27:28)
but geomancy is such a garbage trash cuz (27:22 - 27:31)
i like that move is so good with (27:28 - 27:34)
whatever urban is that you need to do (27:31 - 27:36)
the thing i think mental herb or a white (27:34 - 27:39)
herb yeah exactly i can't remember which (27:36 - 27:42)
one it is but God mental herb is the one (27:39 - 27:44)
that keeps you from getting true into a (27:42 - 27:50)
truant it Oh wanted good white or gone (27:44 - 27:55)
us journey is so unfair poken tournament (27:50 - 27:58)
is a thing do people still play that (27:55 - 28:00)
game you know that that's my question to (27:58 - 28:03)
thee there's a championship series going (28:00 - 28:07)
on and it will be at other events like (28:03 - 28:09)
the Seattle regionals which I don't (28:07 - 28:11)
believe has come up yet the Wisconsin (28:09 - 28:16)
regionals was just last weekend poking (28:11 - 28:18)
tournament will be at nationals it'll be (28:16 - 28:22)
out world's people play it I guess not (28:18 - 28:26)
me anymore I thought you had again no i (28:22 - 28:28)
did i did i did i play with your son (28:26 - 28:29)

about six or seven weeks oh yeah a (28:29 - 28:36)
little over a month yeah yeah played it (28:34 - 28:38)
every every thursday night and played a (28:36 - 28:40)
couple other nights just practicing but (28:38 - 28:43)
yeah I doesn't (28:40 - 28:46)
didn't have legs for me yeah it is a (28:43 - 28:48)
good game and it's a fun game and I mean (28:46 - 28:50)
like i'm not a huge gamer and i will say (28:48 - 28:52)
it is it is good and fun but it's not (28:50 - 28:54)
one that when you have other games to (28:52 - 28:57)
play you're gonna choose poke and (28:54 - 28:59)
tournament look I set it right over (28:57 - 29:03)
those other games the thing about I mean (28:59 - 29:04)
that's sort of the thing about fighting (29:03 - 29:07)
games right is more so than almost any (29:04 - 29:10)
other genre except maybe like MOBAs if (29:07 - 29:12)
you count that as honor of its own if (29:10 - 29:16)
you don't plan on plant like if your (29:12 - 29:20)
casual trash like we are not with that (29:16 - 29:24)
attitude you play it and it's fun but it (29:20 - 29:28)
gets to a point where to fully enjoy the (29:24 - 29:31)
depth of the game you have to dedicate a (29:28 - 29:32)
lot of time to it that's just how (29:31 - 29:35)
fighting games work and sometimes it's (29:32 - 29:38)
more of an investment but you're going (29:35 - 29:40)
to give it a particular date or time (29:38 - 29:45)
yeah I think where I fell off was I hit (29:40 - 29:49)
my my skill (29:45 - 29:51)
I hit feel like the glass ceiling of my (29:49 - 29:54)
skill where I was like I I am this good (29:51 - 29:57)
and if I wanted to get better like I (29:54 - 30:02)
need to invest this much time and that (29:57 - 30:05)
time is too important to me yeah like I (30:02 - 30:09)
but like if if if will or if you Travis (30:05 - 30:12)
or any other you know I know they like (30:09 - 30:16)
Pokemon person came over to my house and (30:12 - 30:17)
we were just like hanging out for the (30:16 - 30:20)
weekend Poquelin tournament would be one (30:17 - 30:22)
of the things that I would be like let's (30:20 - 30:24)
play this on the couch together and have (30:22 - 30:26)
a great time and it will be it would be (30:24 - 30:29)
a great time but you like continue to (30:26 - 30:32)
play it online and and don't get me (30:29 - 30:34)
wrong like playing with with the Pokemon (30:32 - 30:37)
podcast listener base like playing with (30:34 - 30:39)
them was fantastic was super fun but (30:37 - 30:43)
again like it was just your missing so (30:39 - 30:47)
much of the fighting game experience (30:43 - 30:50)
when it when when they're not sitting (30:47 - 30:55)
next to you yea though I poking (30:50 - 30:57)
tournament still very seems to be doing (30:55 - 31:00)
popular in the fighting game scene but I (30:57 - 31:02)
haven't heard much outside of that which (31:00 - 31:06)
I make is it is it popular in the scene (31:02 - 31:07)
if I to do people like competitive (31:06 - 31:11)
fighting game people because I'm just (31:07 - 31:12)
used to things that are made by a (31:11 - 31:14)
Nintendo that try to do that as being (31:12 - 31:16)
and I realized that the crossover a (31:14 - 31:20)
second but I'm just used to people (31:16 - 31:22)
saying what like well smash brothers (31:20 - 31:25)
isn't a real fighting Gator you know I (31:22 - 31:27)
mean I'm used to that sorry I should do (31:25 - 31:29)
people in who are super into fighting (31:27 - 31:31)
games do a lot of them play it (31:29 - 31:34)
competitively even if they're not huge (31:31 - 31:37)
Pokemon fans I well none of us are those (31:34 - 31:39)
people so right sure just I mean I I (31:37 - 31:44)
when I was playing pokin weekly i was i (31:39 - 31:46)
was on the subreddit just like reading (31:44 - 31:49)
strategies or you know zoning zoning is (31:46 - 31:51)
a big thing in in poking tournament (31:49 - 31:54)
which is real real simply put it's just (31:51 - 31:57)
like knowing what moves you can or (31:54 - 32:01)
cannot do in a certain area mmm ben and (31:57 - 32:03)
i would say (32:01 - 32:05)
the that is one of the biggest things in (32:03 - 32:07)
polk and tournament i'm sure it's very (32:05 - 32:08)
important in other fighting games again (32:07 - 32:11)
i'm not an expert but it seemed like the (32:08 - 32:13)
people who are good at pokin and got (32:11 - 32:16)
behind pokin they're also like the same (32:13 - 32:20)
audience that got behind smash brothers (32:16 - 32:23)
and I don't think those two audiences (32:20 - 32:28)
have gone outside of that wheelhouse and (32:23 - 32:29)
that's not to say like like street (32:28 - 32:31)
fighter people are probably only in (32:29 - 32:34)
super industry fighter and yeah killer (32:31 - 32:37)
instinct again super into that but I (32:34 - 32:40)
don't think pokin attract anyone I don't (32:37 - 32:44)
think pokin stole the the Dead or Alive (32:40 - 32:47)
community yeah so what's really (32:44 - 32:50)
disappointing to me was I kind of I (32:47 - 32:52)
guess subconsciously had thought that (32:50 - 32:55)
Nintendo would have learned from their (32:52 - 32:58)
success with splatoon where when that (32:55 - 33:00)
first came out everybody played it for a (32:58 - 33:01)
little while and they're like jeez it's (33:00 - 33:03)
just like five levels what's what's up (33:01 - 33:05)
with this game and so you know limited (33:03 - 33:07)
and then like every two months they came (33:05 - 33:10)
out with new levels every week hitting (33:07 - 33:12)
it would yeah there were in one stage a (33:10 - 33:15)
week and then they had the splat fests (33:12 - 33:17)
for drawing people in to remind them to (33:15 - 33:19)
play and you know like you know even the (33:17 - 33:21)
stupid ones which was like what like hot (33:19 - 33:24)
dogs vs. they end with hamburgers or (33:21 - 33:27)
something like that yeah yeah no you're (33:24 - 33:29)
right and people will get excited they (33:27 - 33:31)
talk about on social media it's like I'm (33:29 - 33:34)
gonna be team hot dog and um and like (33:31 - 33:36)
there's none of that for pokin and there (33:34 - 33:39)
could be yeah I remember they could do (33:36 - 33:41)
like online tournaments and they could (33:39 - 33:44)
do like even if it was like not new (33:41 - 33:46)
Pokemon if it was just new background (33:44 - 33:48)
stages to play and you can because like (33:46 - 33:50)
that's part of the fun it's like seeing (33:48 - 33:51)
what's going on in the background when (33:50 - 33:54)
you're playing in a different arena and (33:51 - 33:57)
all the clothes and stuff I mean I know (33:54 - 33:59)
you have every color of Santa hat but (33:57 - 34:00)
maybe they could have come out to do (33:59 - 34:03)
clothes I do or things for your trainer (34:00 - 34:06)
and just do done that monthly and (34:03 - 34:08)
everything that would have gone some (34:06 - 34:09)
level kept people interested but it's (34:08 - 34:12)
just like it launched it was what it was (34:09 - 34:14)
and it became stale rather rap (34:12 - 34:17)
I remember being at Midwest gaming (34:14 - 34:19)
classic and the amount we could we had (34:17 - 34:24)
to poke ins and shout out to K listener (34:19 - 34:25)
of the show who brought his his wii u (34:24 - 34:28)
his copy of pokin and and his controller (34:25 - 34:31)
very nice of them but we had to to poke (34:28 - 34:33)
and set up the first day they were just (34:31 - 34:34)
you know face computer the second day we (34:33 - 34:38)
linked him and I couldn't believe how (34:34 - 34:40)
many people came in and was like I can't (34:38 - 34:43)
wait till we get more Pokemon more DLC (34:40 - 34:45)
blah blah blah like they were going on (34:43 - 34:47)
and on about it and another thing you do (34:45 - 34:50)
myself like I'm pretty sure they say (34:47 - 34:54)
that they had zero plans for DLC and (34:50 - 34:59)
updates to this game and it is now four (34:54 - 35:02)
months later yeah probably probably (34:59 - 35:03)
what's hindering it is that it (35:02 - 35:05)
originally came out as an arcade cabinet (35:03 - 35:08)
and from what I understand those arcade (35:05 - 35:12)
cabinets are disappearing like even in (35:08 - 35:14)
the arcades in Japan they're they're not (35:12 - 35:17)
there people aren't using them so (35:14 - 35:20)
they're taking them out I mean that (35:17 - 35:23)
doesn't surprise me but hey think you (35:20 - 35:25)
hit the nail on that a bit ago we're (35:23 - 35:28)
like pokin would have been a game where (35:25 - 35:31)
you say like here's a new stage or here (35:28 - 35:34)
is a ash hat for your Pikachu that you (35:31 - 35:36)
could put on during battle over here is (35:34 - 35:38)
like a sash you could wrap around like (35:36 - 35:42)
something just cosmetic because if you (35:38 - 35:45)
look at games like overwatch like the (35:42 - 35:47)
only the only thing that game has going (35:45 - 35:49)
for it after you drop your forty to (35:47 - 35:53)
sixty dollars is is you can spend more (35:49 - 35:56)
money right like it all it is the skins (35:53 - 35:58)
nothing else skins sprays voice like (35:56 - 36:01)
everything after your initial purchase (35:58 - 36:04)
an overwatch is purely cosmetic what's (36:01 - 36:07)
it say well it's okay so first a spray (36:04 - 36:10)
is the thing where you can have your (36:07 - 36:16)
character spray paint a little oh go (36:10 - 36:20)
onto the wall or whatever but also just (36:16 - 36:23)
in overwatch this case I think I mean (36:20 - 36:24)
they are planning on more game modes I (36:23 - 36:25)
think or does not even like (36:24 - 36:27)
competitive there's not even like a rank (36:25 - 36:32)
q yet so so I think I realize you're (36:27 - 36:34)
just giving that as an example but I (36:32 - 36:35)
think they're planning on doing more (36:34 - 36:38)
with that right you're right well but if (36:35 - 36:40)
you were if you were to go out today and (36:38 - 36:43)
by overwatch for forty dollars or sixty (36:40 - 36:45)
dollars depending on where you get it (36:43 - 36:49)
yeah the everything out of the gate in (36:45 - 36:52)
that game is unlocked all the levels the (36:49 - 36:54)
the I think there's two different game (36:52 - 36:57)
modes and then 20 of 24 characters I (36:54 - 36:59)
think everything is unlocked right away (36:57 - 37:02)
the only thing you're unlocking after (36:59 - 37:06)
that is is skins and sprays and there's (37:02 - 37:09)
like a hundred different layers skins (37:06 - 37:12)
for every character and people are (37:09 - 37:13)
dropping money for that like that is (37:12 - 37:16)
what gets people going like that for me (37:13 - 37:19)
adding I didn't care that much I mean I (37:16 - 37:21)
have a different like loot driven (37:19 - 37:24)
mindset and destiny but like in (37:21 - 37:26)
overwatch that clearly works and it (37:24 - 37:28)
works very well and poking like pokin (37:26 - 37:30)
could have done something as simple as (37:28 - 37:34)
like here is a rainbow Santa hat this (37:30 - 37:36)
week but I think but I think will is (37:34 - 37:39)
right that like you know they weren't (37:36 - 37:44)
even really sold on selling it to the (37:39 - 37:46)
Western market until there was a pretty (37:44 - 37:51)
large call for at least they were and it (37:46 - 37:52)
was unclear whether it was going to come (37:51 - 37:54)
here right and I think will is right (37:52 - 37:57)
that's mainly because it to then its (37:54 - 38:00)
first and foremost an arcade an arcade (37:57 - 38:04)
cabinet and if if you went to them and (38:00 - 38:07)
were like why isn't there there dlc for (38:04 - 38:09)
bokken tournament they're like you mean (38:07 - 38:11)
that our cade cabinet we made right like (38:09 - 38:14)
like the grand strategy for that my (38:11 - 38:17)
thing is that they see it differently (38:14 - 38:20)
than we do because we don't have that (38:17 - 38:23)
aspect of the game you know so when you (38:20 - 38:26)
edit that um Steve can you just have it (38:23 - 38:28)
repeatedly having Travis AI think will (38:26 - 38:31)
is right cuz that's just enough right (38:28 - 38:34)
there if i remember i'll repeat it a (38:31 - 38:35)
couple times will make its unreal good (38:34 - 38:38)
maybe put a little like nice like bump (38:35 - 38:40)
and beat behind it (38:38 - 38:43)
don't ever say bump and beat well you (38:40 - 38:46)
sound like a 60 year old Midwestern I'm (38:43 - 38:48)
getting there I'm getting there guys uh (38:46 - 38:50)

chronic sleeper on Twitter messaged me (40:26 - 40:32)

want to hear your take on this but we'll (40:32 - 40:38)
hear your take on two guys uh this is (40:35 - 40:41)
off a NeoGAF thread now let me preface I (40:38 - 40:44)
don't read me a pic yeah you said old (40:41 - 40:48)
news but you didn't prep me for all this (40:44 - 40:51)
was gonna I was I was surfing the Geo (40:48 - 40:55)
cities and for some reason neogaf is so (40:51 - 40:57)
popular this is actually from exactly (40:55 - 41:00)
about nine days ago here so not that old (40:57 - 41:02)
I'm not gonna read the whole post (41:00 - 41:04)
because most of its somebody's opinion (41:02 - 41:06)
but I'll just get right to the the gist (41:04 - 41:09)
here nugget bridge tweeted 15 of the top (41:06 - 41:11)
50 players were disqualified for (41:09 - 41:14)
cheating in the Japan Cup and the final (41:11 - 41:15)
standings are now being updated on (41:14 - 41:19)
Pokemon global link yeah that heard (41:15 - 41:22)
about that all right if for those (41:19 - 41:25)
unfamiliar the top 50 get a day one (41:22 - 41:27)
invites the Pokemon world championship (41:25 - 41:29)
top 30 to get an invitation at the (41:27 - 41:31)
Japanese national championship to do (41:29 - 41:33)
this they had one weekend to play a (41:31 - 41:36)
maximum of 40 maybe 30 battles on a (41:33 - 41:39)
special in-game ladder and hope they're (41:36 - 41:42)
yellow would be the top 32 of 50 the (41:39 - 41:44)
rest the world plays in an offline (41:42 - 41:47)
circuit like Capcom / oh that's just (41:44 - 41:50)
Japan stuff but there's your there we do (41:47 - 41:52)
this in the United States there's a (41:50 - 41:53)
weekend where tournaments open you play (41:52 - 41:57)
it ranks you elo Pokemon publishes what (41:53 - 42:00)
what pokemon are popular like a month (41:57 - 42:03)
later this is nothing new (42:00 - 42:06)
but in Japan there there's really only (42:03 - 42:09)
this way to get into the national (42:06 - 42:11)
championships the Japanese national (42:09 - 42:14)
championships FYI so there was a rust (42:11 - 42:15)
you have to go to a regionals and you (42:14 - 42:17)
have to be there in person and in Japan (42:15 - 42:18)
you can do it through an online (42:17 - 42:21)
competition that's that's the main (42:18 - 42:23)
difference and the last thing I want to (42:21 - 42:26)
stay here is an FYI there was a (42:23 - 42:28)
follow-up from a Japanese player that (42:26 - 42:30)
was qualified from the 15 that was (42:28 - 42:32)
disqualified using hacks were detected (42:30 - 42:36)
the those that were we're using a save (42:32 - 42:39)
file manipulation to repeatedly lose to (42:36 - 42:41)
other game carts while queuing up in the (42:39 - 42:44)
same time as multiple 3d asses and to (42:41 - 42:47)
try to push themselves into the ranking (42:44 - 42:50)
Japan's qualification system is fully (42:47 - 42:53)
under Georgia turds jurisdiction of the (42:50 - 42:56)
pokemon company so it differs from (42:53 - 42:58)
region to region which are under (42:56 - 43:00)
jurisdiction of the pokemon company (42:58 - 43:02)
international unfortunately japan has (43:00 - 43:05)
used this awful this is where an opinion (43:02 - 43:07)
comes an awful online ladder battle (43:05 - 43:10)
qualification method since 2012 and this (43:07 - 43:13)
is what it leads to but obviously so (43:10 - 43:15)
that that's not what I had heard about (43:13 - 43:19)
this situation I had heard that they (43:15 - 43:22)
were using bots and by using the bots (43:19 - 43:24)
they were recording what teams other (43:22 - 43:26)
people were using so that when they (43:24 - 43:28)
actually in there a competitive game (43:26 - 43:30)
came across them they already knew like (43:28 - 43:33)
what teams and moves the other people (43:30 - 43:37)
were using my that I mean you could be (43:33 - 43:39)
right i was confused by what you were (43:37 - 43:40)
saying because it sounded like what (43:39 - 43:43)
you're saying is they were skirt they're (43:40 - 43:46)
using some sort of they rang so devil (43:43 - 43:48)
they lose a bunch of games in a row it (43:46 - 43:50)
should make a lot of sense to me what (43:48 - 43:52)
alternate competitors and the alternate (43:50 - 43:54)
competitors would automatically lose to (43:52 - 43:57)
them which window ringing right yeah (43:54 - 43:59)
yeah that's the that that situation I (43:57 - 44:01)
explained where like you you you (43:59 - 44:03)
purposely get like a cart that you're (44:01 - 44:04)
going to lose against that's like super (44:03 - 44:06)
popular in clash royale not to bring (44:04 - 44:08)
about much shriya but you you just make (44:06 - 44:10)
an account that account keeps losing (44:08 - 44:12)
until it's useless and then you just (44:10 - 44:14)
delete it and make a new account and (44:12 - 44:16)
then keep meeting that new account until (44:14 - 44:17)
it's useless and (44:16 - 44:19)
just win trading right there um so it's (44:17 - 44:21)
it's similar to what people do in the (44:19 - 44:23)
states where they go to a regional with (44:21 - 44:24)
a bunch of their friends and just agree (44:23 - 44:26)
like if you're competing against me then (44:24 - 44:29)
you're gonna lose yep right so I can win (44:26 - 44:33)
yep there there is you mean that there's (44:29 - 44:35)
there's people in the world that just (44:33 - 44:40)
like lie oh it wasn't that your lesson (44:35 - 44:45)
that you learned with me po and don't (44:40 - 44:46)
cross the streams we can't reference (44:45 - 44:49)
other podcasts on this podcast that (44:46 - 44:53)
there's a lot to unwrap and talk about (44:49 - 44:55)
here and I don't know how deep you guys (44:53 - 44:57)
want to go in but let me start off (44:55 - 45:00)
saying like I know a lot of competitive (44:57 - 45:02)
Pokemon players in the community and (45:00 - 45:06)
they're all great people though the ones (45:02 - 45:09)
i know at least everyone you heard it (45:06 - 45:12)
here first folks everyone anything (45:09 - 45:16)
anyone has done in the pokemon (45:12 - 45:18)
competitive community is officially a (45:16 - 45:22)
okay in the eyes of Steve jr. but (45:18 - 45:28)
welcome on VG sees or egcg or pokin or (45:22 - 45:31)
whatever whatever Avenue you want to go (45:28 - 45:33)
down for your competitive Pokemon (45:31 - 45:36)
battling wants to be taken seriously (45:33 - 45:41)
like this stuff has to stop and the easy (45:36 - 45:46)
argument would be like Oh ray Rizzo two (45:41 - 45:50)
years ago had a dream hacked pokemon (45:46 - 45:54)
which he didn't use but it had an egg (45:50 - 45:56)
move that it could not never learn and (45:54 - 45:58)
he said he got it from a friend and he (45:56 - 46:02)
was your world championship champion (45:58 - 46:04)
three times and he didn't get (46:02 - 46:06)
disqualified he didn't get banned they (46:04 - 46:09)
just acknowledged that he had a Pokemon (46:06 - 46:11)
that was clearly hacked and they moved (46:09 - 46:14)
on if this was league legends and they (46:11 - 46:16)
were this was dota or this was (46:14 - 46:19)
counter-strike not that I'm very (46:16 - 46:21)
familiar with those but i'm pretty sure (46:19 - 46:23)
that stuff wouldn't really pass people (46:21 - 46:26)
you play like competitive league players (46:23 - 46:28)
get like suspended for weeks because (46:26 - 46:30)
they said a naughty (46:28 - 46:34)
word at the lake like they flipped (46:30 - 46:35)
someone off at a tournament or something (46:34 - 46:38)
so they're a little more tricks yeah and (46:35 - 46:40)
I think I think it should be especially (46:38 - 46:42)
like if you want yeah competitive video (46:40 - 46:45)
games to be taken seriously like that (46:42 - 46:49)
stuff just doesn't fly like if if a (46:45 - 46:52)
football player who gave somebody the (46:49 - 46:54)
finger he'd probably be suspended too (46:52 - 46:57)
yeah yeah yeah or find I think that so (46:54 - 47:00)
right there's a very clear problem that (46:57 - 47:03)
exists in competitive Pokemon that (47:00 - 47:07)
exists everywhere and so this is hard (47:03 - 47:09)
for me to say it the right way but like (47:07 - 47:12)
in other sports let's say e sports and (47:09 - 47:15)
sports all together there is an (47:12 - 47:17)
organizational body that takes actions (47:15 - 47:20)
to reprimand people who cheat or play (47:17 - 47:25)
incorrectly and that in some ways is in (47:20 - 47:27)
line to counteract something where they (47:25 - 47:32)
can't regulate which is fanboying right (47:27 - 47:34)
there are a lot of people who are in the (47:32 - 47:36)
competitive pokemon community who are (47:34 - 47:40)
super fans of particular competitive (47:36 - 47:42)
Pokemon players whether it's because (47:40 - 47:44)
they also have YouTube channels or (47:42 - 47:46)
they're just very public or just because (47:44 - 47:50)
they win a lot where it's like I will be (47:46 - 47:52)
happy if i can just contribute to this (47:50 - 47:55)
famous person's success rather than you (47:52 - 47:57)
know i'm here to compete for myself as (47:55 - 47:59)
well alright that exists in all sports (47:57 - 48:02)
like you you even if you're a competitor (47:59 - 48:04)
in basketball baseball or something else (48:02 - 48:05)
and you're a huge fan of another player (48:04 - 48:08)
you might alter your own performance (48:05 - 48:09)
just because you're a fan of that other (48:08 - 48:11)
player I think basketball and baseball (48:09 - 48:14)
are probably bad examples maybe car (48:11 - 48:15)
racing I don't know anything about that (48:14 - 48:18)
but the organizational bodies like try (48:15 - 48:21)
to take regulatory action so that when (48:18 - 48:26)
something is just a very crass display (48:21 - 48:30)
of the poor play sportsmanship let's put (48:26 - 48:32)
that way right poor sportsmanship that (48:30 - 48:34)
they will take action regulatory action (48:32 - 48:35)
against that and that doesn't exist (48:34 - 48:37)
right it's very clear it doesn't exist (48:35 - 48:40)
in competitive Pokemon at all yeah yeah (48:37 - 48:43)
I think you could you could look at you (48:40 - 48:44)
could look at competitive (48:43 - 48:47)
games like poking tournament everyone is (48:44 - 48:49)
going to be at this the same playing (48:47 - 48:51)
field no matter if they put one hour in (48:49 - 48:54)
or they put two thousand hours and not (48:51 - 48:57)
regarding the weird 127 hours in (48:54 - 49:02)
starring whatever James Franco it's (48:57 - 49:04)
embarrassing that I could that I was (49:02 - 49:06)
about to call him Danny Boyle was the (49:04 - 49:09)
director of that maybe say the same (49:06 - 49:12)
could be said for overwatch again (49:09 - 49:14)
everything you you pay for that purchase (49:12 - 49:19)
is is unlocked and ready to go and I'm (49:14 - 49:21)
sure eventually overwatch will get into (49:19 - 49:23)
the competitiveness or the official (49:21 - 49:26)
ranking and stuff then you look at you (49:23 - 49:28)
look at a game like just your standard (49:26 - 49:32)
pokemon x and y you don't start at the (49:28 - 49:34)
same playing field and if you want v's (49:32 - 49:36)
if you want Ivy's if you want specific (49:34 - 49:39)
pokemon that all takes time and so a lot (49:36 - 49:43)
of competitive players they go well like (49:39 - 49:46)
look at a fighting game that you don't (49:43 - 49:51)
have to EV train Ryu or or blanca or (49:46 - 49:54)
chun-li like they're they're just there (49:51 - 49:55)
then the best they can be and now it (49:54 - 49:57)
comes down to the skill of a player so (49:55 - 50:00)
it's not even I'll go beyond that it's (49:57 - 50:03)
about integrity right because because (50:00 - 50:06)
it's clearly known that in order to be (50:03 - 50:08)
successful in competitive Pokemon you (50:06 - 50:10)
have to use hacked pokemon because (50:08 - 50:14)
nobody has the time to do soft resets (50:10 - 50:19)
for a perfect IV shiny groudon right (50:14 - 50:22)
that people with integrity who are like (50:19 - 50:24)
well it's impossible to have these truly (50:22 - 50:26)
competitive Pokemon but the winners are (50:24 - 50:28)
going to have those pokemon so I'm not (50:26 - 50:31)
going to compete at all right right yeah (50:28 - 50:35)
or you're like a lot of like a large (50:31 - 50:38)
portion of the fans of this show get (50:35 - 50:42)
their Pokemon through legit means but (50:38 - 50:45)
that's hundreds of hours that they spent (50:42 - 50:48)
doing that as opposed to learning the (50:45 - 50:50)
meta playing the field right like yeah (50:48 - 50:52)
yeah so Steven if you do like it's not (50:50 - 50:54)
impossible even if you do have the time (50:52 - 50:57)
and do you know dedicate that (50:54 - 51:01)
time you're still in some way you still (50:57 - 51:03)
end up behind because the people who (51:01 - 51:05)
used I don't even know what the kids use (51:03 - 51:08)
these days but like I use whatever (51:05 - 51:10)
software to get whatever the Pokemon (51:08 - 51:12)
they want they've been practicing that (51:10 - 51:15)
whole time yeah and I was I just going (51:12 - 51:16)
to say it's a huge statement about the (51:15 - 51:18)
current state of competitive Pokemon (51:16 - 51:21)
that one of the regionals I don't know (51:18 - 51:22)
if it was Madison or st. Louis there (51:21 - 51:27)
were only like 96 VGC masters in the cop (51:22 - 51:30)
96 I've been to local competitions that (51:27 - 51:32)
had more than 96 people playing but (51:30 - 51:34)
nobody wants to play in this current (51:32 - 51:38)
format yeah I think it speaks volumes to (51:34 - 51:41)
the playerbase of Pokemon and it speaks (51:38 - 51:45)
dude type of game pokemon is if you (51:41 - 51:49)
remove the competitiveness of Pokemon (51:45 - 51:53)
you have a game where you have over 700 (51:49 - 51:57)
creatures that can be very drastically (51:53 - 52:01)
different whether that's v's or Ivy's or (51:57 - 52:04)
abilities or moves every creature can be (52:01 - 52:06)
so different and that's what pokemon (52:04 - 52:09)
originally wanted and I think they still (52:06 - 52:11)
want that and then you look at the (52:09 - 52:14)
competitive scene and players don't want (52:11 - 52:18)
that they want the best pokemon and they (52:14 - 52:22)
want it as fast as possible and there's (52:18 - 52:24)
a yeah but what's important is well (52:22 - 52:26)
there are all these variables to make to (52:24 - 52:28)
make it possible that every single (52:26 - 52:30)
Pokemon is going to be unique there's (52:28 - 52:34)
also by nature of a game being (52:30 - 52:35)
competitive people are going to play it (52:34 - 52:37)
enough to where they find out what the (52:35 - 52:40)
optimal configuration for that thing is (52:37 - 52:41)
that you might change next week when (52:40 - 52:46)
more people are running x pokemon then (52:41 - 52:48)
they were the week before so you end up (52:46 - 52:50)
with a different EV spread for this (52:48 - 52:53)
month but um but generally even though (52:50 - 52:59)
you can you could EV train your um your (52:53 - 53:07)
golem for special attack and a speed but (52:59 - 53:10)
that's not going to work like there is (53:07 - 53:14)
there is there are one or two correct (53:10 - 53:17)
answers for how should I EV train let's (53:14 - 53:20)
Pokemon for almost every Pokemon and I (53:17 - 53:21)
don't mean that in a way of like if you (53:20 - 53:23)
don't do it the way that the meta (53:21 - 53:26)
dictates you're doing it wrong I just (53:23 - 53:28)
mean that even though there are so many (53:26 - 53:31)
variables there's an extent to which (53:28 - 53:34)
there is a version of that Pokemon that (53:31 - 53:36)
performs better than other versions so (53:34 - 53:37)
even though they're all are these (53:36 - 53:40)
variables at tournaments it's going to (53:37 - 53:42)
tend towards a lot of the same type of (53:40 - 53:44)
thing yeah and I'll say two things to (53:42 - 53:46)
follow up on what Steve was saying (53:44 - 53:49)
number one when you have competitive top (53:46 - 53:51)
competitive players saying i only played (53:49 - 53:54)
the latest game until i got the mega (53:51 - 53:56)
stone and because that's all you needed (53:54 - 53:59)
to be part of the current competitive (53:56 - 54:00)
format and i didn't play any further (53:59 - 54:03)
well what does that really say about (54:00 - 54:05)
your love for pokemon that you couldn't (54:03 - 54:07)
even play the story mode all the way (54:05 - 54:10)
through to the end and then another (54:07 - 54:12)
thing that you know i think kind of (54:10 - 54:16)
detracts from really sharp criticism of (54:12 - 54:19)
the VGC format is that so many people (54:16 - 54:22)
are comfortable and happy playing in the (54:19 - 54:26)
smog on tears that they ignore or it (54:22 - 54:28)
takes pressure off of the BGC format for (54:26 - 54:30)
having to be a balanced and yeah (54:28 - 54:32)
inclusive environment because so many (54:30 - 54:34)
people like well i'm not gonna play (54:32 - 54:37)
crummy BGC i'll be happy playing smog on (54:34 - 54:39)
at my local league every week and and (54:37 - 54:42)
that's right that's not what I really (54:39 - 54:44)
that should not be what competitive (54:42 - 54:45)
Pokemon is oriented at they should (54:44 - 54:47)
really be oriented towards developing a (54:45 - 54:50)
BGC environment that's inclusive and (54:47 - 54:52)
exciting for people especially now that (54:50 - 54:55)
it's not even scholarships anymore its (54:52 - 54:59)
actual just a cash money payout yeah you (54:55 - 55:01)
know that should be open to as many (54:59 - 55:04)
people as want to be able to play it and (55:01 - 55:09)
not exclusive you have a you but there's (55:04 - 55:11)
a clear problem there has been for some (55:09 - 55:14)
time where you know we've we've seen it (55:11 - 55:16)
and there's been reports where and you (55:14 - 55:17)
mentioned it earlier where players go (55:16 - 55:19)
and they purposely lose so other players (55:17 - 55:20)
move up (55:19 - 55:22)
yeah and you know you can't stop that (55:20 - 55:24)
that's that's that happens in other (55:22 - 55:26)
games that's not exclusive to pokemon (55:24 - 55:29)
but you we there's a clear divide and it (55:26 - 55:31)
gets bigger and bigger every year of you (55:29 - 55:34)
have players that love and I'm not (55:31 - 55:36)
telling people how to play game if some (55:34 - 55:37)
people want to play only to mega stone (55:36 - 55:39)
and then you know competitive battle (55:37 - 55:41)
that that's there they paid for the game (55:39 - 55:42)
that's their right they can do whatever (55:41 - 55:46)
they want but in an audience sense you (55:42 - 55:48)
have people who who play the game who (55:46 - 55:50)
either love collecting Pokemon they love (55:48 - 55:54)
breeding pokemon they love strategizing (55:50 - 55:56)
and I know a ton of breeders who spend a (55:54 - 55:58)
lot of time to get perfect IV pokémon (55:56 - 56:01)
and then you have this other audience (55:58 - 56:04)
that doesn't care for that at all and (56:01 - 56:07)
I'm not saying they need to but you know (56:04 - 56:09)
they have hacked pokemon they're using (56:07 - 56:13)
hacked pokemon and they're good players (56:09 - 56:17)
I mean whether or not they have certain (56:13 - 56:19)
pokemon they're clearly performing at a (56:17 - 56:21)
level where other players cannot that (56:19 - 56:24)
does like the one audience is is (56:21 - 56:26)
following what pokemon originally (56:24 - 56:27)
intended for to have all these unique (56:26 - 56:30)
creatures that mean something to you and (56:27 - 56:32)
then you have this other audience that (56:30 - 56:35)
is completely destroying that in that (56:32 - 56:38)
mindset because they're so invested in (56:35 - 56:40)
competitiveness and I'm not saying one (56:38 - 56:42)
side is right and one side is wrong but (56:40 - 56:44)
it's a clear disconnect and I think (56:42 - 56:46)
where it comes from me and my personal (56:44 - 56:50)
opinion is I have a lot of Pokemon that (56:46 - 56:52)
that means something to me in a memory (56:50 - 56:55)
sense so for example one pokemon i have (56:52 - 56:58)
is the scraggy that you could get from (56:55 - 57:02)
worlds that happened and I think (56:58 - 57:02)
2009-2010 I can't remember but I would (57:05 - 57:09)
have to be after 2010 because that's (57:08 - 57:11)
when black and white came out yep you're (57:09 - 57:13)
right maybe 2011 so I have this world (57:11 - 57:16)
with a scraggy that was exclusive to (57:13 - 57:19)
people who attended world and it means a (57:16 - 57:20)
lot to me I know exactly where it is my (57:19 - 57:23)
pokemon bank i have us I have a box for (57:20 - 57:27)
like event a specific Pokemon I I (57:23 - 57:29)
haven't done anything with it I haven't (57:27 - 57:30)
ever used in a battle I've never taught (57:29 - 57:33)
her to move it sits in my bank and (57:30 - 57:36)
it makes me happy to see it like I love (57:33 - 57:38)
it because it reminds me of worlds it (57:36 - 57:40)
reminds me of an event I was at this is (57:38 - 57:43)
an exclusive Pokemon no one has it and I (57:40 - 57:45)
can't say no one else has it because (57:43 - 57:49)
anyone who has been hacking Pokemon can (57:45 - 57:51)
look at that specific Pokemon and hacked (57:49 - 57:54)
an exact double right now and they also (57:51 - 57:57)
now have the world scraggy and that (57:54 - 58:01)
takes away so much from like the the (57:57 - 58:03)
charm and the exclusivity that Pokemon (58:01 - 58:06)
is supposed to bring can you hack those (58:03 - 58:08)
little those little ribbons that come (58:06 - 58:12)
with the ah yeah yeah you can yeah I'll (58:08 - 58:14)
teach you how to hack Pokemon after (58:12 - 58:16)
after we're done recording some people (58:14 - 58:22)
just like lie on purpose so I'm again (58:16 - 58:25)
like there is there is no easy answer (58:22 - 58:28)
there's but I think I think the three of (58:25 - 58:32)
us can agree on like if Pokemon wants to (58:28 - 58:34)
be considered seriously like they need (58:32 - 58:39)
they need to pick some some battle here (58:34 - 58:43)
they either need to you know they can't (58:39 - 58:46)
ban 15 people in Japan and then look at (58:43 - 58:48)
the United States world champion who (58:46 - 58:52)
clearly had hacked pokemon and just be (58:48 - 58:54)
okay with that like yeah what what makes (58:52 - 58:56)
this wrong and this right when at the (58:54 - 59:00)
end of the day 115 people got banned for (58:56 - 59:04)
hacked pokemon or in this case cheating (59:00 - 59:06)
and some end and this person didn't and (59:04 - 59:09)
so they need to pick a side they need to (59:06 - 59:12)
say like heck Pokemon are okay we we (59:09 - 59:15)
know that they exist we know that (59:12 - 59:17)
they're there they're just okay or they (59:15 - 59:19)
need to decide like they are not okay (59:17 - 59:22)
and in Pokemon Sun and Moon there's (59:19 - 59:25)
going to be extreme hack checks to make (59:22 - 59:27)
sure whether that's updating more (59:25 - 59:30)
frequently or requiring you to check the (59:27 - 59:31)
internet when you're doing like there (59:30 - 59:33)
has to be some kind of check or they (59:31 - 59:35)
just need to accept that hacked pokemon (59:33 - 59:38)
or the standard or they just add them at (59:35 - 59:42)
a sort of tournament game mode where (59:38 - 59:45)
you can edit Pokemon on the fly like (59:42 - 59:47)
they won't be you won't be able to use (59:45 - 59:48)
them in your single-player experience (59:47 - 59:52)
but you can just set level 100 Pokemon (59:48 - 59:54)
with the move sets you want sure opener (59:52 - 59:57)
for everyone therefore eliminating the (59:54 - 59:59)
need for perhaps like like a Pokemon (59:57 - 60:02)
Stadium only more customizable like (59:59 - 60:05)
pokemon showdown pixel a real thing (60:02 - 60:08)
right right because at this point like (60:05 - 60:11)
neither side is happy you have the the (60:08 - 60:14)
hackers that are saying like everyone (60:11 - 60:15)
else's opinion doesn't matter we're (60:14 - 60:17)
playing on skill and then you have the (60:15 - 60:20)
people who who care about Pokemon and (60:17 - 60:22)
who are spending the time going like (60:20 - 60:24)
this is unfair and this doesn't want me (60:22 - 60:25)
to play the game like you are (60:24 - 60:27)
segregating your audience because of (60:25 - 60:30)
competitive Pokemon battles and there (60:27 - 60:32)
needs to be a solution (60:30 - 60:34)
and I don't know if there will be but I (60:32 - 60:38)
can tell you the the two to three years (60:34 - 60:40)
I played competitive Pokemon it was not (60:38 - 60:43)
an enjoyable time well i still have fun (60:40 - 60:45)
because in our slack community we come (60:43 - 60:48)
up with wacky tournaments and i just (60:45 - 60:50)
enjoy having those wacky tournaments all (60:48 - 60:53)
right like my quick claw tournament but (60:50 - 60:56)
we will we will take a quick break I (60:53 - 60:58)
didn't realize how long that was going (60:56 - 60:59)

here but just just for reference so so (62:19 - 62:27)

to like a disney world they also are in (62:35 - 62:40)
the business of pins well it hasn't (62:37 - 62:42)
disney world always done that yeah yeah (62:40 - 62:46)
i I II III didn't know that though until (62:42 - 62:48)
the people the people who made pacts (62:46 - 62:50)

Pikachu Bulbasaur Charmander and (62:58 - 63:02)
squirtle what do you what do you think (63:00 - 63:04)
the prices on four pins like these are (63:02 - 63:06)
like your your metal your your shiny (63:04 - 63:09)
colored pins (63:06 - 63:11)
there's a word for it it's like that (63:09 - 63:13)
what that why they do the coloring (63:11 - 63:15)
what's the word for that Travis look at (63:13 - 63:22)
what i want to say cloyes own a is (63:15 - 63:24)
something like that if it sounds like (63:22 - 63:27)
even remotely that French I can (63:24 - 63:31)
guarantee you I don't know it um wow (63:27 - 63:33)
these are like they look like you know (63:31 - 63:36)
packs pins or Disney World pins I don't (63:33 - 63:39)
know what specific you know name they (63:36 - 63:40)
have they have like the outlines that (63:39 - 63:43)
are like super shiny but a 4-pack how (63:40 - 63:44)
much do you think that runs you four (63:43 - 63:47)
pins you know take them on your hat dirt (63:44 - 63:51)
ten dollars all right all right Travis (63:47 - 63:52)
what's your bid price is right he should (63:51 - 63:56)
I know it's gonna be like hi or whatever (63:52 - 64:02)
so I'll say I'll say like seven dollars (63:56 - 64:05)
for a four pack (64:02 - 64:05)
so if it was ten dollars or you're doing (64:05 - 64:10)
250 a pin right yeah and if this is (64:08 - 64:12)
seven dollars you're doing like what a (64:10 - 64:15)
dollar fifty up in dollar sixty what if (64:12 - 64:18)
I told you four pins at pokemon center (64:15 - 64:21)
com a Charizard a Bulbasaur squirtle and (64:18 - 64:26)
a Pikachu was 24 99 you'd better get me (64:21 - 64:29)
some free shipping on that you want a (64:26 - 64:31)
2-pack you want just magic-carpet (64:29 - 64:37)
gyarados 1299 that is half the price you (64:31 - 64:39)
want to you want a five pack you get a (64:37 - 64:42)
masterball a great ball a pokeball an (64:39 - 64:44)
ultra ball and a Pikachu special (64:42 - 64:47)
delivery five pins includes a lanyard (64:44 - 64:53)
for you to put the pins on 34 99 oh man (64:47 - 64:55)
but those dragon knight pins look sweet (64:53 - 64:59)
highway robbery the whimsicott pin with (64:55 - 65:01)
the substitute looks swag I'm pretty (64:59 - 65:04)
sure I'm pretty sure packs pins are like (65:01 - 65:07)
499 I think they're five dollars so that (65:04 - 65:12)
this is this is about 650 a pin at this (65:07 - 65:14)
point I don't know how much Disney World (65:12 - 65:16)
charges I'm sure it's in the five to (65:14 - 65:20)
eight dollar range but (65:16 - 65:25)
I can't justify that cost even for the (65:20 - 65:28)
Articuno Zapdos and Moltres oh man I (65:25 - 65:30)
look so good don't get me wrong they (65:28 - 65:33)
look awesome (65:30 - 65:37)
but like force (65:33 - 65:39)
that much for one pin and the (65:37 - 65:42)
possibility of like my my worry is like (65:39 - 65:43)
you put on a lanyard because that's what (65:42 - 65:45)
like they encourage like you go to a (65:43 - 65:47)
convention and you got this lanyard full (65:45 - 65:49)
of pins and look at how cool you are (65:47 - 65:51)
look at this peer pressure you got all (65:49 - 65:52)
these pins you need pens any pins you (65:51 - 65:55)
want to trade pins and like my fear my (65:52 - 65:58)
worry is like your lanyard gets caught (65:55 - 66:00)
on something or like the convention hall (65:58 - 66:02)
is busy and all of a sudden you get (66:00 - 66:05)
through the convention hall you're (66:02 - 66:07)
getting ready to eat your lunch and your (66:05 - 66:10)
master ball pin is missing because it's (66:07 - 66:13)
a pin and they could possibly fall off (66:10 - 66:15)
oh I'll tell you what's worse than that (66:13 - 66:17)
the enamel and that's what I was the (66:15 - 66:20)
word I was looking for enamel pins uh (66:17 - 66:23)
the enamel is gonna chip haha it's just (66:20 - 66:25)
it's just gonna chip because most people (66:23 - 66:27)
actually put these not on lanyards but (66:25 - 66:29)
they on their bags right everybody's (66:27 - 66:32)
been to a Pokemon event and people have (66:29 - 66:34)
bags full of different pins that they've (66:32 - 66:36)
gotten pokemon pins from different areas (66:34 - 66:38)
and stuff like that and chip chip chip (66:36 - 66:41)
that paint is going to go (66:38 - 66:43)
oh man that whimsicott would substitute (66:41 - 66:47)
look so good and I can I read one of the (66:43 - 66:50)

Jolteon because of your being ways this (68:35 - 68:47)
this is what fits do to us this is why (68:44 - 68:50)
we can't have nice things there's a war (68:47 - 68:53)
being waged in the comment search in the (68:50 - 68:55)

and t bleezy from st. Louis Missouri and (68:55 - 69:02)

a product a bad review because you don't (69:20 - 69:25)
like the Pokemon chosen wow this (69:22 - 69:27)
reviewer has never been on the internet (69:25 - 69:32)
before her only pins bring out this type (69:27 - 69:34)
of anger (69:32 - 69:37)
and war between people and the assets (69:34 - 69:38)
that I've been waiting for this for a (69:37 - 69:40)
long time it's just sad that people feel (69:38 - 69:42)
the need to give this exciting product a (69:40 - 69:44)
bad review solely based on their facts (69:42 - 69:46)
their favorite pokemon isn't part of (69:44 - 69:49)
this set I bet ya new to the internet (69:46 - 69:52)
right I did I made uh I made these (69:49 - 69:55)
rubber trainer pins back in the day have (69:52 - 69:59)
one yet cool they uh they were cool they (69:55 - 70:01)
they were probably one of the coolest (69:59 - 70:06)
things I made uh they were also probably (70:01 - 70:10)
they were they probably would have done (70:06 - 70:12)
extremely well on Kickstarter this was a (70:10 - 70:16)
time before Kickstarter easy and I took (70:12 - 70:20)
a risk prehistory back in vintage pkmn (70:16 - 70:23)
cast times I took a risk paid a lot of (70:20 - 70:27)
money i got the pins made and in order (70:23 - 70:30)
to break even i had to charge i believe (70:27 - 70:35)
about seven dollars for a pin mm-hmm and (70:30 - 70:38)
then i had to charge about a dollar (70:35 - 70:41)
ninety to ship it so i was charging (70:38 - 70:46)
people about nine dollars flat to send (70:41 - 70:49)
these pins over the across the world and (70:46 - 70:53)
i think i had 250 of them made and i (70:49 - 70:57)
believe i made probably a profit about a (70:53 - 71:01)
dollar a pin so i mean i sold all the (70:57 - 71:04)
pins so ultimately i made like 200 bucks (71:01 - 71:08)
um uh off of this but (71:04 - 71:13)
too I felt bad I didn't think they would (71:08 - 71:16)
sell at seven dollars a pin I thought (71:13 - 71:18)
that was too much because i didn't think (71:16 - 71:22)
i would like i mean i sold it as as nine (71:18 - 71:24)
dollars for everything free shipping and (71:22 - 71:26)
stuff and you know what what really is (71:24 - 71:28)
the difference between eight and nine (71:26 - 71:30)
dollars yeah not much no one's going to (71:28 - 71:33)
no one's gonna be like you know if was a (71:30 - 71:35)
dollar cheaper I'd get it and that's (71:33 - 71:36)
probably what pokemon thing is thinking (71:35 - 71:38)
here you know they can charge what they (71:36 - 71:40)
want because they obviously know the (71:38 - 71:43)
supply and demand but like that was a (71:40 - 71:46)
rubber pin yeah I was gonna say it's a (71:43 - 71:50)
very difficult area lismore expelled (71:46 - 71:52)
like yeah you're saying the Pokemon (71:50 - 71:54)
Center materials more expensive right oh (71:52 - 71:56)
no I was thinking opposite because (71:54 - 71:58)
you're like your pin had like all of the (71:56 - 72:00)
different colors of rubber that needed (71:58 - 72:03)
to be included do when i went to get (72:00 - 72:05)
design when I away the unrolling when I (72:03 - 72:08)
got when I are quote price quotes they (72:05 - 72:10)
told me that this was the cheapest way (72:08 - 72:13)
to make a pin Oh interesting they they (72:10 - 72:15)
said like these pins that I'm looking at (72:13 - 72:17)
on Pokemon Center were actually some of (72:15 - 72:19)
the more expensive and so of course I (72:17 - 72:21)
went I went the cheap route and I was I (72:19 - 72:22)
was worried that they wouldn't be able (72:21 - 72:25)
to get the the detail and I think the (72:22 - 72:27)
trainer pin was very detailed yeah and (72:25 - 72:31)
and so if you know anything about (72:27 - 72:34)
ordering bulk the more you order the (72:31 - 72:37)
cheaper the product gets I don't have to (72:34 - 72:39)
imagine (72:37 - 72:43)
I just I just think that Pokemon Center (72:39 - 72:48)
is ordering more than 250 pins yeah yeah (72:43 - 72:52)
so they're their profit margins on these (72:48 - 72:55)
have to be through the roof like they (72:52 - 72:59)
have to be making money hand over fist (72:55 - 73:05)
by song a four pack of pins for 2499 hmm (72:59 - 73:10)
have to be anyway before we get into (73:05 - 73:13)
Pokemon a weak Pokemon Center (73:10 - 73:15)
to be at gencon Pokemon has a very big (73:13 - 73:16)
booth at gencon if you're going to (73:15 - 73:18)
gencon (73:16 - 73:20)
if you look at the gencon map Pokemon (73:18 - 73:23)
Center has a Pokemon that there's a (73:20 - 73:25)
square that is bigger than ever most (73:23 - 73:27)
other squares in the vendor hall and it (73:25 - 73:30)
says Pokemon and if you had click on it (73:27 - 73:32)
it takes you to pokemon center com i'm (73:30 - 73:34)
assuming pokemon center com is taking (73:32 - 73:36)
over that booth and they will be selling (73:34 - 73:38)
plushies and pins and all this stuff and (73:36 - 73:39)
they're probably just gonna rake in the (73:38 - 73:42)
money I mean will and I talked about (73:39 - 73:45)
this an episode or two ago but I feel (73:42 - 73:48)
like if I see these pins in person i'm (73:45 - 73:51)
going to buy them (73:48 - 73:51)
not handle how cool they are online boy (73:51 - 73:59)
that being said our pokemon of the week (73:56 - 73:59)
is Persian because this is this has (74:00 - 74:07)
become a if if you're not a cat you're (74:04 - 74:09)
not Pokemon of the week yeah there you (74:07 - 74:13)
go kitty cat cast Travis is a move set (74:09 - 74:16)
but before we do that Persian normally (74:13 - 74:18)
lives in towns and cities although (74:16 - 74:20)
popular for its elegance it is extremely (74:18 - 74:23)
difficult to raise as a pet due to its (74:20 - 74:26)
fickle and temperamental personality it (74:23 - 74:28)
will scratch anyone including its (74:26 - 74:31)
trainer with little or no provoke shin (74:28 - 74:33)
and it has been a vacation my fault (74:31 - 74:35)
provocation and it has been observed (74:33 - 74:38)
ripping its prey apart for no (74:35 - 74:40)
discernible reason however when a (74:38 - 74:43)
Persian is yanked by its whiskers it (74:40 - 74:45)
becomes temporarily dhakal hostile (74:43 - 74:50)
docile due to its unknown reasons I got (74:45 - 74:51)
temperamental right you got to give me (74:50 - 74:53)
some credit there there's a big word (74:51 - 74:57)
guys that an end fickle okay Travis (74:53 - 75:00)
don't you love the Meowth yes is one of (74:57 - 75:02)
my favorite Pokemon yeah Meowth is (75:00 - 75:04)
really cool how does that you missed you (75:02 - 75:05)
okay i was gonna say how does your love (75:04 - 75:08)
for me out transition into persian it (75:05 - 75:11)
does it's a short answer that question i (75:08 - 75:14)
like a boat I like me off a little more (75:11 - 75:18)
but versions cool too I normally look at (75:14 - 75:22)
the top smogon set just to give me an (75:18 - 75:27)
idea if with with these Pokemon that (75:22 - 75:29)
that you're not going to see every day (75:27 - 75:30)
unless you're playing like though some (75:29 - 75:33)
of the lower smogon tears or you're just (75:30 - 75:35)
playing with your friends like you're (75:33 - 75:38)
not likely to see a Persian so you like (75:35 - 75:40)
I tend to look at the smoke on set to (75:38 - 75:42)
see what kind of people have found (75:40 - 75:45)
for that Pokemon and I really don't like (75:42 - 75:47)
I mean it's probably the best thing you (75:45 - 75:49)
can do with a version right but I really (75:47 - 75:52)
don't like it thematically that sudden (75:49 - 75:54)
they recommend is nasty plot with hyper (75:52 - 75:57)
voice in power ghosts and either water (75:54 - 76:00)
pulse or substitute with a life orb and (75:57 - 76:03)
then taking advantage of the technische (76:00 - 76:06)
an ability with 252 and special attack (76:03 - 76:09)
and speed and you can do that but that (76:06 - 76:12)
feels wrong I he look at Persian and it (76:09 - 76:15)
doesn't feel like it should be a Pokemon (76:12 - 76:19)
it's doing special attacks that's just (76:15 - 76:24)
me let's take a slasher yeah yeah so (76:19 - 76:26)
that's what we're going to make instead (76:24 - 76:29)
we're going to do a physically attacking (76:26 - 76:32)
set which is going to be used fake out (76:29 - 76:36)
play rough it has technician so we're (76:32 - 76:39)
going to use bite and then the last move (76:36 - 76:42)
is you turn so what you can do here and (76:39 - 76:45)
then you're going to max out your speed (76:42 - 76:49)
and attack v's put a choice band on (76:45 - 76:51)
there or no not a choice band because I (76:49 - 76:53)
did fake out so in so you're going to (76:51 - 76:55)
put a life for bond there so what you (76:53 - 77:00)
can do is you're going to try to similar (76:55 - 77:03)
to what a pokemon like I gamba pom is (77:00 - 77:06)
the bus comparison where you have a very (77:03 - 77:08)
strong fake out from technician that's (77:06 - 77:10)
going to do more damage than your (77:08 - 77:12)
average fake-out is and then you finish (77:10 - 77:15)
it off with something like a u-turn or (77:12 - 77:19)
the light or the play rough so you're (77:15 - 77:22)
sort of designed for to hit kos as (77:19 - 77:25)
opposed to 18 Kos I didn't take the time (77:22 - 77:28)
to calculate what percentage of the (77:25 - 77:31)
field that you're likely to see would (77:28 - 77:33)
actually be to hit ko'd by such a (77:31 - 77:37)
pokemon but in theory if it shouldn't be (77:33 - 77:40)
too bad of a set and i would recommend (77:37 - 77:41)
that adamant nature since you're already (77:40 - 77:45)
pretty fast at 115 base speed I think (77:41 - 77:50)
I'd I think I'm done but the most (77:45 - 77:52)
important thing here is an Omega Ruby (77:50 - 77:55)
off the sapphire that there is a five (77:52 - 77:58)
percent chance that if you catch a (77:55 - 78:01)
Persian it will have a quick claw on it (77:58 - 78:05)
nice well then why did I say is life for (78:01 - 78:09)
me she's quickly that's not true shiny (78:05 - 78:13)
Persian extremely disappointing (78:09 - 78:15)
yeah even tell that it's shiny the way (78:13 - 78:18)
you can tell is it instead of a tan (78:15 - 78:20)
inside its ear it's it's like a pink (78:18 - 78:23)
inside anger yeah and it's just a little (78:20 - 78:27)
brighter yeah but that's it it's hard to (78:23 - 78:29)
tell even not even on the screen but the (78:27 - 78:33)
pink is what pokemon like this where I (78:29 - 78:35)
just think like who's in charge of (78:33 - 78:39)
making shinies right like like my might (78:35 - 78:41)
the first thing my mind goes to is (78:39 - 78:44)
Persian is naturally like a like a white (78:41 - 78:47)
a beige like an off-white yeah Wow like (78:44 - 78:50)
like why wouldn't you do like a black (78:47 - 78:54)
cat as the shiny yeah like it takes all (78:50 - 78:57)
I'd like granted that's a clever idea (78:54 - 78:59)
Steve but it doesn't take that long to (78:57 - 79:02)
get there I'm sorry shiny Meowth is even (78:59 - 79:05)
worse is it really yeah it's just a (79:02 - 79:07)
little darker there's not even any (79:05 - 79:10)
difference inside of the ears don't (79:07 - 79:12)
but they need to be fired whoever you (79:10 - 79:15)
are which I'm interest that was your job (79:12 - 79:17)
at the pokemon company international (79:15 - 79:19)
like like that is your sole job is I'm (79:17 - 79:21)
the person who like determines what the (79:19 - 79:23)
color differences are for the shinies (79:21 - 79:24)
because it's obviously nothing about the (79:23 - 79:26)
body type or anything it's just the (79:24 - 79:28)
color difference in person who the (79:26 - 79:30)
person who has decided these shiny (79:28 - 79:32)
colors are probably the same person that (79:30 - 79:34)
was like ah we need another water (79:32 - 79:37)
pokemon I'm just asking yeah no no (79:34 - 79:38)
that's just what I'm saying it's like (79:37 - 79:40)
right your job your only job is to (79:38 - 79:43)
determine what the shiny colors are and (79:40 - 79:46)
you're really bad at it and everybody (79:43 - 79:48)
knows it but it's like your uncle owns (79:46 - 79:51)
Pokemon without your only job yeah it is (79:48 - 79:52)
and and their uncle owns Pokemon and (79:51 - 79:53)
that's why they're you're never gonna (79:52 - 79:55)
get fired even though everybody plays (79:53 - 79:57)
out of their office and like they just (79:55 - 79:58)
like put their hand to their mouth I'm (79:57 - 79:59)
like oh my god can you believe what a (79:58 - 80:01)
terrible job this guy continues to do (79:59 - 80:03)
and the only reason he keeps his job is (80:01 - 80:06)
because his uncle's in charge the I can (80:03 - 80:09)
tell you one thing the the person in (80:06 - 80:11)
charge of Chinese is not a cat owner (80:09 - 80:13)
because they would have probably thought (80:11 - 80:15)
of a black cat as a shiny Persian (80:13 - 80:19)
instantly like that as that is your (80:15 - 80:22)
obvious go to for a shiny cat and if (80:19 - 80:26)
some of these are the shinies date back (80:22 - 80:30)
to Gen 2 so I in general the newer (80:26 - 80:33)
shinies if memory serves are a little (80:30 - 80:36)
butter yeah yeah I mean you've at all (80:33 - 80:37)
looks like bacon but you can't win them (80:36 - 80:42)
all yeah shiny unit okay can hardcore (80:37 - 80:47)
bacon um I trivia here Persians crystal (80:42 - 80:51)
sprite is different it's different from (80:47 - 80:54)
that of gold and silver making it one of (80:51 - 80:56)
the few Pokemon that have three (80:54 - 80:59)
distinctively different sprites and (80:56 - 81:02)
generation to (80:59 - 81:05)
uh yeah Jenny Eva tells bacon that's (81:02 - 81:07)
amazing it really is I mean like it (81:05 - 81:09)
looks dumb but at the same time it's (81:07 - 81:13)
also really cool that's that's what we (81:09 - 81:16)
asked for a year you know if you're (81:13 - 81:17)
gonna make it shiny at least make it (81:16 - 81:21)
memorable no one's going to forget that (81:17 - 81:23)
shine Eva tell looks like a slab of (81:21 - 81:28)
bacon and I think that is where we leave (81:23 - 81:29)
off (81:28 - 81:31)

McClure com or mix Laird kamiya /p (83:21 - 83:26)
camicus there will be randomly be (83:24 - 83:27)
playing an old episode of it's super (83:26 - 83:29)
effective there's a chat there so you (83:27 - 83:31)
can chat with people there is an iOS app (83:29 - 83:33)
and Android app you can go right on the (83:31 - 83:37)
website actually this podcast is being (83:33 - 83:41)
live rock cast on mixer right now and (83:37 - 83:43)
we have six people listening I didn't (83:41 - 83:45)
really heavily advertised that I just (83:43 - 83:46)
wanted to see if it worked clearly does (83:45 - 83:49)
work so we can do more of this in the (83:46 - 83:51)
future but yeah and what's really (83:49 - 83:54)
amazing is when the old episodes are (83:51 - 83:56)
playing Steve can actually do a live (83:54 - 83:59)
feed of himself talking over the old (83:56 - 84:02)
episode and sometimes he'll do things (83:59 - 84:05)
where he talks into your left ear and (84:02 - 84:06)
sometimes he'll talk into your right ear (84:05 - 84:09)
and then sometimes he'll talk into the (84:06 - 84:10)
center of your head and you keep telling (84:09 - 84:12)
him you're in the middle of my head and (84:10 - 84:13)
he doesn't understand what that means (84:12 - 84:17)
I'm talking in here is this left ear is (84:13 - 84:21)
this like pokemon podcast ASMR I already (84:17 - 84:23)
made this joke I think so I think so (84:21 - 84:26)
okay I won't do it again well it's a (84:23 - 84:29)
very easier it's very it just think of (84:26 - 84:31)
it like a real radio station like radio (84:29 - 84:33)
DJs can talk over songs or whatever I (84:31 - 84:35)
have the ability to do that so we're (84:33 - 84:36)
gonna try it for a month if it you know (84:35 - 84:38)
if it doesn't catch on if people aren't (84:36 - 84:41)
using it I'll cancel the the monthly fee (84:38 - 84:43)
it costs for me to keep it up and (84:41 - 84:47)
running and but I for me I don't know it (84:43 - 84:50)
what what your guys's listening habits (84:47 - 84:54)
are but like I struggle when a service (84:50 - 84:56)
like Spotify goes tell me what you want (84:54 - 85:00)
to listen to like I I don't know and so (84:56 - 85:03)
I I like services more along the lines (85:00 - 85:05)
of Pandora where I can just say these (85:03 - 85:07)
are the three artists I've been digging (85:05 - 85:10)
give me music like that and and Pandora (85:07 - 85:12)
does that very well and it serves a need (85:10 - 85:13)
and that's why I listen to a lot of (85:12 - 85:16)
beats one because my know for the most (85:13 - 85:18)
part that's current popular music and I (85:16 - 85:20)
and I enjoy that so I just turn it on (85:18 - 85:21)
because i don't i don't want that choice (85:20 - 85:23)
because most the time i'm not even focus (85:21 - 85:26)
listening to it so when it comes to i (85:23 - 85:30)
was i was meeting with with some some (85:26 - 85:33)
podcast people about the show and the (85:30 - 85:34)
stats and everything and they were like (85:33 - 85:37)
you know for your podcast we've noticed (85:34 - 85:39)
that your your older episodes get (85:37 - 85:41)
listened to a lot i'm gonna have us like (85:39 - 85:42)
yeah i don't understand like that (85:41 - 85:44)
pokemon news isn't isn't relevant (85:42 - 85:47)
anymore i don't get why people would be (85:44 - 85:48)
listening to it but yeah they do pretty (85:47 - 85:54)
well and so I think I think that's um (85:48 - 85:56)
think that's it like a wall maybe for (85:54 - 85:57)
some newer listeners they go back and (85:56 - 85:59)
they go well with like 200 and some (85:57 - 86:02)
episodes I don't know where to start (85:59 - 86:03)
where I'd want to listen to and so I (86:02 - 86:07)
think the the mix ler I think the mix (86:03 - 86:09)
Lair is is like hey I don't know what I (86:07 - 86:11)
want to listen to but I want I want I (86:09 - 86:13)
want something Pokemon I'll just turn (86:11 - 86:16)
that on and and see what's playing and (86:13 - 86:19)
yeah I've listened to more I've listened (86:16 - 86:22)
to more episodes of it's super effective (86:19 - 86:23)
in the last three days than I have in (86:22 - 86:25)
like the last 3 years just because like (86:23 - 86:27)
like I'm just sitting there and I was (86:25 - 86:30)
like I wonder I wonder like I make these (86:27 - 86:32)
long playlist to play but you know four (86:30 - 86:34)
hours later I don't know what episode (86:32 - 86:35)
it's going to be honest it's like I (86:34 - 86:36)
wonder what's on the mixer and I turn it (86:35 - 86:38)
on it's like oh like this is the episode (86:36 - 86:41)
where where where Travis makes fun of (86:38 - 86:42)
kid and does a pretty good kid (86:41 - 86:45)
impression I do it really yeah I can't (86:42 - 86:47)
remember I was it was super funny it i (86:45 - 86:50)
don't know if it's sad or if it's (86:47 - 86:51)
something to say about the show we're (86:50 - 86:54)
like I'm laughing at like jokes from two (86:51 - 86:58)
years ago um yeah it Steve seems to find (86:54 - 87:01)
himself very funny i do I absolutely do (86:58 - 87:04)
think I'm hilarious and then he tells me (87:01 - 87:07)
about it yeah yeah and so yep uh yeah I (87:04 - 87:10)
