i'm excited to finally talk about (0:44 - 0:48)
something 25th anniversary pokemon (0:46 - 0:50)
related that's not (0:48 - 0:53)
shiny cards not you flexing (0:50 - 0:57)
not you ratting me out and spoiling my (0:53 - 0:57)
good (0:57 - 1:01)
name to twitch you'd how dare you (0:57 - 1:04)
i show you overpriced houses i show you (1:01 - 1:06)
aspirational (1:04 - 1:09)
living oh what did he do oh he spent an (1:06 - 1:10)
entire twitch stream (1:09 - 1:13)
dragging my good name through the mud (1:10 - 1:14)
what he did (1:13 - 1:17)
and then he said i could never live with (1:14 - 1:17)
him (1:17 - 1:19)
or you and he said he could never live (1:17 - 1:21)
with you either he just dragged us (1:19 - 1:22)
through the muscles (1:21 - 1:24)
true it's quite the opposite i could (1:22 - 1:28)
never live with him (1:24 - 1:28)
and i was going to say like i i feel (1:29 - 1:32)
like we should have (1:31 - 1:35)
a uh ceremony of honor because this (1:32 - 1:37)
is probably the last time i am recording (1:35 - 1:39)
in this particular recording studio and (1:37 - 1:40)
it is (1:39 - 1:44)
being retired for all time (1:40 - 1:47)
until wow i mean put the curtains up at (1:44 - 1:47)
the end (1:47 - 1:52)
cover the pictures yes (1:47 - 1:52)
uh that was a joke there's not a lot of (1:52 - 1:56)
pokemon news this week (1:54 - 1:57)
[Music] (1:56 - 1:59)
well but i don't understand what what is (1:57 - 2:00)
the issue (1:59 - 2:04)
with uh i mean i can understand (2:00 - 2:07)
you shouldn't live with anybody because (2:04 - 2:07)
you (2:07 - 2:11)
have un natural expectations and (2:07 - 2:12)
standards (2:11 - 2:15)
for what the concept of living in a home (2:12 - 2:18)
that's true it is yeah you're you're 100 (2:15 - 2:19)
right (2:18 - 2:21)
because when i live in my home i live (2:19 - 2:23)
here it is my place to relax (2:21 - 2:27)
and just be a human being not a museum (2:23 - 2:30)
for the nobody you allow into your house (2:27 - 2:31)
to come through (2:30 - 2:35)
and peer at your dustless uh shelving (2:31 - 2:39)
etc so what was the issue (2:35 - 2:40)
no no no there was no issue (2:39 - 2:43)
[Laughter] (2:40 - 2:47)
what did he say he said that hey (2:43 - 2:50)
greg like wrote down everything i am a (2:47 - 2:51)
too messy (2:50 - 2:53)
which is not true because i've been to (2:51 - 2:54)
his house (2:53 - 2:56)
and i have i've been to his house on (2:54 - 2:57)
messy days but of course you know that's (2:56 - 2:59)
not him that's the other person that (2:57 - 2:59)
lives (2:59 - 3:01)
of course he likes to sell everybody (2:59 - 3:02)
else so that it's everybody else's (3:01 - 3:03)
problem (3:02 - 3:05)
forgetting that i have stayed in a hotel (3:03 - 3:07)
with his messy butt (3:05 - 3:10)
hmm on both sides that is (3:07 - 3:12)
absolutely true i bring my own laundry (3:10 - 3:15)
basket i'm very (3:12 - 3:17)
structured yeah this is a hotel room in (3:15 - 3:20)
chicago yeah i saw that (3:17 - 3:23)
and seattle with your when you have your (3:20 - 3:27)
throughout the room uh instagram photo (3:23 - 3:29)
ops (3:27 - 3:32)
this is unacceptable i'll tell you why (3:29 - 3:34)
you're also too messy we're also too (3:32 - 3:36)
messy i didn't say well it was too messy (3:34 - 3:37)
you did too (3:36 - 3:39)
uh i'll take a picture of my side of the (3:37 - 3:41)
bed and i'll take a picture of irene's (3:39 - 3:42)
side of the bed and then apply that to (3:41 - 3:44)
the whole house (3:42 - 3:48)
suss yeah okay probably taking your (3:44 - 3:50)
word for it that that those those things (3:48 - 3:51)
are (3:50 - 3:55)
are each other's sides that's true (3:51 - 3:58)
uh we do have some pokemon news there (3:55 - 3:59)
was a six minute (3:58 - 4:01)
pokemon snap trailer i don't know if you (3:59 - 4:03)
guys saw that i had about four minutes (4:01 - 4:05)
in i was like bored (4:03 - 4:08)
yeah it's it's kind of boring it felt (4:05 - 4:08)
very (4:08 - 4:10)
well we'll get to it uh there's some (4:08 - 4:12)
pokemon go news uh (4:10 - 4:14)
and then we have the chilling rains (4:12 - 4:15)
which we kind of touched on last week (4:14 - 4:15)
but (4:15 - 4:17)
we should talk about chilling rains and (4:15 - 4:19)
then we have the pokemon primer stuff (4:17 - 4:21)
which we didn't talk about which we (4:19 - 4:21)
should (4:21 - 4:24)
and that's pretty much all we have for (4:21 - 4:25)
the episode (4:24 - 4:26)
wait they made a remake of that time (4:25 - 4:29)
travel movie including pokemon (4:26 - 4:32)
yeah pokemon primers very it's very hard (4:29 - 4:33)
to understand (4:32 - 4:36)
and i've seen graphs and stuff (4:33 - 4:36)
but wait i've got pre news (4:37 - 4:43)
free news okay this is what's pretty i (4:40 - 4:44)
yesterday (4:43 - 4:48)
i had to go to the target in (4:44 - 4:52)
edina which is now the town that i live (4:48 - 4:52)
next to (4:52 - 4:55)
i'm i'm next to fancy oh way to dox (4:52 - 4:56)
yourself (4:55 - 5:00)
they must have had 200 (4:56 - 5:03)
of single packs of battle styles out on (5:00 - 5:04)
the shelf (5:03 - 5:08)
where anybody could have gotten them (5:04 - 5:08)
did you get any no i don't want no (5:08 - 5:13)
pokemon cards (5:10 - 5:13)
the the thing i think that most targets (5:14 - 5:17)
are doing although i don't know if it (5:16 - 5:19)
applies to all targets (5:17 - 5:22)
is that if it's if it's a pokemon item (5:19 - 5:23)
more than twenty dollars (5:22 - 5:26)
which is a lot of pokemon items uh you (5:23 - 5:28)
can only get them on fridays (5:26 - 5:29)
at like three o'clock at like the (5:28 - 5:31)
counter (5:29 - 5:32)
and if it's under twenty dollars they (5:31 - 5:34)
will put it on the shelf (5:32 - 5:37)
so booster packs or free game but (5:34 - 5:39)
did your target have a limit of three (5:37 - 5:41)
booster packs (5:39 - 5:44)
i mean it was edina no yeah because i (5:41 - 5:46)
because the one in richfield which has (5:44 - 5:47)
no pokemon on the shelf (5:46 - 5:50)
has a sign that says you're limited to (5:47 - 5:53)
three but the one in edina (5:50 - 5:56)
rules don't apply to them i don't know (5:53 - 5:58)
if we've said on the show obviously the (5:56 - 6:00)
pokemon card debacle is (5:58 - 6:02)
you know i did that video on youtube and (6:00 - 6:04)
then we talk about it all the time on (6:02 - 6:06)
twitch but it's not specific like when (6:04 - 6:08)
you go to target it's not specifically (6:06 - 6:09)
pokemon cards it's (6:08 - 6:12)
the baseball cards are yeah baseball (6:09 - 6:13)
cards are gone (6:12 - 6:15)
they're real hot right now although but (6:13 - 6:16)
last time went to matching a lot of the (6:15 - 6:18)
magic was gone too (6:16 - 6:21)
like their whole area was pretty empty (6:18 - 6:23)
magic has been good in milwaukee i can i (6:21 - 6:25)
can i can find rows and rows of magic (6:23 - 6:28)
well get me my magic school super box (6:25 - 6:28)
for half price (6:28 - 6:31)
that's that's next week buddy i know (6:28 - 6:32)
what is magic (6:31 - 6:34)
school super box now we're skipping that (6:32 - 6:35)
stuff okay all right (6:34 - 6:37)
we are now skipping that set there's (6:35 - 6:38)
some good things in that section yeah i (6:37 - 6:41)
bought four singles and i'm done (6:38 - 6:41)
um let's talk about pokemon snap okay (6:41 - 6:47)
we got two things in regards to pokemon (6:45 - 6:48)
snap uh (6:47 - 6:50)
there was an ign article that actually (6:48 - 6:52)
just came out (6:50 - 6:54)
uh this week and then there was that six (6:52 - 6:56)
minute trailer which i put my (6:54 - 6:57)
reaction of that and i kind of talked (6:56 - 6:59)
over that trailer and gave my (6:57 - 7:00)
impressions on the trailer (6:59 - 7:02)
on youtube if you want to check that out (7:00 - 7:04)
youtube.com pkmencast (7:02 - 7:08)
but uh boy was that trailer kind of (7:04 - 7:11)
corporate e oh it was (7:08 - 7:15)
it was a heavy duty sales pitch (7:11 - 7:17)
but not in a good way yeah not like a (7:15 - 7:18)
fun it was just (7:17 - 7:22)
yeah and at lent hall will be (7:18 - 7:25)
night sometimes oh was it like come on (7:22 - 7:26)
beautiful (7:25 - 7:28)
lentil and take pictures of the many (7:26 - 7:32)
varieties of pokemon (7:28 - 7:36)
and it's like here we have the gentle (7:32 - 7:39)
the magikarp use your scan function to (7:36 - 7:39)
find (7:39 - 7:42)
alternate paths you can sometimes see (7:39 - 7:44)
pokemon from behind (7:42 - 7:48)
or other angles this viper (7:44 - 7:51)
is arguing with this artillery what (7:48 - 7:54)
will possibly happen i tried (7:51 - 7:56)
like i swear i did get minute four (7:54 - 7:58)
before my brain went (7:56 - 8:01)
why why are you doing the stairs (7:58 - 8:04)
it's weird because they've been so good (8:01 - 8:05)
at like (8:04 - 8:07)
the video game industry has been so good (8:05 - 8:09)
at doing like 60 second trailers (8:07 - 8:12)
showing you stuff in a very fast pace (8:09 - 8:14)
and getting you excited (8:12 - 8:15)
but there's like a point in the trailer (8:14 - 8:17)
that is kind of cool um it shows how (8:15 - 8:19)
like alternate paths (8:17 - 8:22)
work um which we knew there was going to (8:19 - 8:23)
be alternate paths (8:22 - 8:28)
for replayability uh (8:23 - 8:29)
although i'm very worried if there's (8:28 - 8:32)
only one alternate path per level that's (8:29 - 8:32)
not (8:32 - 8:34)
that's not a lot that's not a lot but (8:32 - 8:36)
we'll see if there's like three or four (8:34 - 8:36)
or five (8:36 - 8:38)
or if there's alternate paths in (8:36 - 8:41)
alternate paths that would be cool (8:38 - 8:42)
but there's like one point where they're (8:41 - 8:44)
underwater so that's cool in itself (8:42 - 8:45)
you're you're in the (8:44 - 8:48)
what's what's it called the z1 the rove (8:45 - 8:49)
one you're in the (8:48 - 8:53)
vehicle you're the photographer canopy (8:49 - 8:55)
you're all underwater which you know (8:53 - 8:56)
that didn't exist in the first pokemons (8:55 - 8:58)
now i guess (8:56 - 8:59)
you were in space though at one point so (8:58 - 9:01)
that's kind of cool uh so you're all (8:59 - 9:02)
underwater and then they get to a point (9:01 - 9:03)
where (9:02 - 9:05)
i think there's like a not a crawler a (9:03 - 9:06)
clawlitzer and then there's like a (9:05 - 9:08)
tentacruel and then there's like an (9:06 - 9:10)
the game actually pauses and it asks you (9:08 - 9:13)
which way you want to go (9:10 - 9:16)
um so that that didn't happen uh in the (9:13 - 9:17)
first one there (9:16 - 9:19)
there was kind of hints at alternate (9:17 - 9:21)
paths in the first one (9:19 - 9:23)
uh like how you're in the cave and then (9:21 - 9:25)
you throw the pester ball and the (9:23 - 9:26)
electrode explodes and then your cart (9:25 - 9:28)
kind of goes off and it's like it feels (9:26 - 9:29)
like an alternate path but it's just (9:28 - 9:31)
opening up another level (9:29 - 9:35)
yeah um so that was that was cool to see (9:31 - 9:39)
that you know you you had that choice (9:35 - 9:42)
and they showed the apples and they they (9:39 - 9:43)
showed like the pokey flute (9:42 - 9:44)
and although they didn't call it pokey (9:43 - 9:46)
flute and the apples are called (9:44 - 9:49)
fruit fruit fluff i think fluff (9:46 - 9:52)
or fluff fruit no it's fluff fruit i (9:49 - 9:54)
still don't understand this illuminati (9:52 - 9:56)
illuminati thing (9:54 - 9:58)
the illuminati is real because they (9:56 - 9:59)
start off the trailer saying like (9:58 - 10:01)
they're so rare and then later in the (9:59 - 10:03)
trailer they're like they're like here's (10:01 - 10:05)
these balls that turn them illuminati (10:03 - 10:09)
so there are aluminum balls (10:05 - 10:11)
that will light up the pokemon in new (10:09 - 10:13)
and unusual ways (10:11 - 10:16)
but then there are pokemon who are just (10:13 - 10:16)
naturally (10:16 - 10:19)
filled with this toxic substance it's (10:16 - 10:20)
aluminum energy (10:19 - 10:23)
it is not toxic substance they have been (10:20 - 10:24)
mutated to (10:23 - 10:27)
be different and glowing we all know (10:24 - 10:29)
that glowing from the 80s anything that (10:27 - 10:30)
glows (10:29 - 10:34)
is bad that was the 80s it's 20 21 greg (10:30 - 10:36)
glowing is good feel the happiness in (10:34 - 10:38)
your heart and let it shine through you (10:36 - 10:41)
this is a role reversal (10:38 - 10:44)
[Laughter] (10:41 - 10:48)
yeah so apparently at night or sometime (10:44 - 10:49)
you'll trigger (10:48 - 10:52)
giant illuminated pokemon that haven't (10:49 - 10:53)
been hit by the ball (10:52 - 10:55)
it's very confusing uh they could (10:53 - 10:57)
probably make sense once the game comes (10:55 - 10:58)
out i mean they had to (10:57 - 11:01)
they had to discover illumina before (10:58 - 11:02)
they could make balls to trigger (11:01 - 11:03)
illumina (11:02 - 11:05)
come on now it's science there are also (11:03 - 11:07)
those flowers that you throw the (11:05 - 11:08)
aluminum ball (11:07 - 11:10)
in to light them up to get things to (11:08 - 11:13)
happen these are pokey flowers (11:10 - 11:16)
yeah i'm sure (11:13 - 11:16)
uh i don't the problem i think i have (11:17 - 11:22)
with the trailer (11:20 - 11:24)
is boring this is this is coming from (11:22 - 11:27)
somebody who is very excited for this (11:24 - 11:28)
game (11:27 - 11:30)
is i don't think that trailer sold (11:28 - 11:32)
anyone who is on the fence (11:30 - 11:35)
i will agree actually it pushed so there (11:32 - 11:36)
was a short (11:35 - 11:38)
trailer or there was a short one from (11:36 - 11:40)
ign that had pushed me (11:38 - 11:43)
towards the side of getting it uh (11:40 - 11:45)
and then i literally watched this i said (11:43 - 11:46)
uh nah (11:45 - 11:50)
no oh dang yeah it uh it unsold me (11:46 - 11:52)
on it because i was just like this is (11:50 - 11:55)
not (11:52 - 11:55)
uh any excitement i had for this game (11:55 - 12:01)
so lawson which is a japanese (11:58 - 12:02)
convenience store (12:01 - 12:04)
in japan i felt i don't know why i felt (12:02 - 12:06)
like i had to finish that sentence (12:04 - 12:08)
um so there there are a couple japanese (12:06 - 12:10)
convenience stores there's family mart (12:08 - 12:12)
there's 7-eleven there's lawson those (12:10 - 12:14)
are probably the biggest three (12:12 - 12:16)
uh sorry if you're in japan and i missed (12:14 - 12:20)
one please feel free to let me okay (12:16 - 12:20)
no they're missing out so i uh irene and (12:20 - 12:25)
i went to lawson (12:24 - 12:28)
quite a few times i i think we picked up (12:25 - 12:28)
our um (12:28 - 12:30)
gosh we got tickets to something and we (12:28 - 12:31)
picked him up at lawson (12:30 - 12:34)
but uh sometimes 7-eleven or lawsons or (12:31 - 12:35)
family mart's (12:34 - 12:37)
they have like these vending machines in (12:35 - 12:39)
them and they're specifically only (12:37 - 12:42)
they look like atms but they're only for (12:39 - 12:43)
tickets (12:42 - 12:45)
so like movie tickets or concerts or (12:43 - 12:47)
wrestling events (12:45 - 12:50)
and i don't think any of them had (12:47 - 12:51)
english options (12:50 - 12:53)
and or at least some of the events we (12:51 - 12:55)
want some events were weird because they (12:53 - 12:56)
were like you (12:55 - 12:57)
you could go to the machine and get (12:56 - 12:59)
tickets (12:57 - 13:01)
but some events like wrestling we went (12:59 - 13:03)
to see new japan pro (13:01 - 13:06)
you had to go to a website buy it then (13:03 - 13:08)
it would send it to the machine (13:06 - 13:10)
and then you go to the machine to pick (13:08 - 13:12)
it up but you couldn't (13:10 - 13:15)
just buy it was i'm i'm almost positive (13:12 - 13:16)
that like that's how they do all the (13:15 - 13:18)
movies so like if you wanted to get see (13:16 - 13:22)
um uh what's this a rude movie i can't (13:18 - 13:24)
remember what's called secret coco (13:22 - 13:25)
if you want to see coco you go to that (13:24 - 13:27)
machine and then it prints out your like (13:25 - 13:29)
free cocoa or your freezer rude on the (13:27 - 13:31)
receipt that's how people were getting (13:29 - 13:34)
you know codes for zurud so lawson is (13:31 - 13:36)
partnering (13:34 - 13:38)
with uh the pokemon company and they (13:36 - 13:39)
will be offering (13:38 - 13:42)
printed photos from pokemon snap (13:39 - 13:45)
at their machines oh it's just like (13:42 - 13:46)
blockbuster (13:45 - 13:48)
yes i'm not sure if it's a unique (13:46 - 13:49)
machine yet (13:48 - 13:51)
or if it's one of just the ticket (13:49 - 13:53)
machines or if they already have photo (13:51 - 13:55)
machines (13:53 - 14:01)
but you could just buy a color printer (13:55 - 14:04)
or you could just in america just (14:01 - 14:06)
take your switch photos move them to (14:04 - 14:08)
your computer and then send them to like (14:06 - 14:08)
walgreens (14:08 - 14:12)
how do i do that what how do i take my (14:08 - 14:13)
switch photos and move them to my (14:12 - 14:14)
computer my (14:13 - 14:15)
switch and my computer don't talk to (14:14 - 14:17)
each other yeah you do the design where (14:15 - 14:18)
you do the qr code (14:17 - 14:21)
you ever do that qr code thing what are (14:18 - 14:24)
you talking about (14:21 - 14:27)
so so you know how the switch has like (14:24 - 14:27)
uh (14:27 - 14:29)
the eshop at the bottom and it has (14:27 - 14:30)
settings and then it has the photo (14:29 - 14:31)
button (14:30 - 14:32)
where are you all you see all your (14:31 - 14:34)
screenshots yeah (14:32 - 14:36)
yeah okay yeah sure so you click on the (14:34 - 14:38)
photos and you see all your screenshots (14:36 - 14:40)
and then you can either you can see you (14:38 - 14:41)
can send some to twitter (14:40 - 14:43)
that's yeah or facebook i've done that (14:41 - 14:45)
yeah so they added a third button (14:43 - 14:47)
instead of sending the instead of (14:45 - 14:49)
sending to twitter or facebook you can (14:47 - 14:51)
send to qr code (14:49 - 14:53)
and then you open up your phone and then (14:51 - 14:55)
you use your phone's camera and scan the (14:53 - 14:57)
qr code and then a link pops up and then (14:55 - 14:59)
you tap the link (14:57 - 15:01)
and then it it connects to a local (14:59 - 15:02)
connection (15:01 - 15:05)
and then you got to go back and hit okay (15:02 - 15:05)
and then it's (15:05 - 15:08)
on the same wi-fi as my switch no the (15:05 - 15:09)
switch makes its own (15:08 - 15:11)
local wi-fi that your phone then (15:09 - 15:13)
connects to it's really weird (15:11 - 15:17)
how is this so complicated (15:13 - 15:21)
i'm already exhausted it works i (15:17 - 15:23)
tried it it's okay it does it does what (15:21 - 15:24)
it needs to do (15:23 - 15:27)
i mean i will say this there are about (15:24 - 15:28)
50 (15:27 - 15:32)
accidental photos of me playing ring fit (15:28 - 15:34)
that are on my switch that i need to go (15:32 - 15:36)
and delete (15:34 - 15:39)
it's like it's like when you're playing (15:36 - 15:40)
pokemon go and you just have like 30 (15:39 - 15:41)
photos of like a p (15:40 - 15:42)
dub because you're just trying to get (15:41 - 15:46)
them just trying to clear it out (15:42 - 15:46)
and delete delete delete delete so this (15:46 - 15:51)
wasn't a reality as a kid though (15:49 - 15:53)
well i was a kid you guys were adults (15:51 - 15:54)
but (15:53 - 15:56)
like color printers were not a thing in (15:54 - 15:58)
like well they were a thing in (15:56 - 16:02)
in like 1990 (15:58 - 16:04)
printer in the 80s absolutely a thing (16:02 - 16:06)
not like a color photo printer they were (16:04 - 16:07)
like 500 (16:06 - 16:10)
in the 90s i mean they were expensive (16:07 - 16:11)
but they existed (16:10 - 16:12)
so that's why you had to go to (16:11 - 16:15)
blockbuster but blockbuster was printing (16:12 - 16:16)
out they weren't printing out (16:15 - 16:21)
photos no right they were printing out (16:16 - 16:21)
stickers (16:21 - 16:25)
i don't remember because i never did (16:23 - 16:26)
that because why wouldn't i do the (16:25 - 16:29)
original pokemon snap so (16:26 - 16:32)
look my i would cry i'd be the kid on (16:29 - 16:33)
the floor (16:32 - 16:36)
kicking my legs wailing my arms because (16:33 - 16:37)
i wanted (16:36 - 16:39)
stickers of my pokemon at blockbuster (16:37 - 16:41)
i'm almost positive they were stickers (16:39 - 16:44)
okay and i'm looking up the pokemon stab (16:41 - 16:45)
station (16:44 - 16:47)
look it up and look up how much it costs (16:45 - 16:48)
because that (16:47 - 16:50)
my parents were very they were like no (16:48 - 16:51)
it's too expensive i'm sure it was like (16:50 - 16:54)
4.99 or something for a sticker sheet (16:51 - 16:57)
that's expensive all right what a sheet (16:54 - 16:58)
because i'm pretty sure it printed 30 (16:57 - 17:01)
stickers they are printed stickers (16:58 - 17:03)
yes they had a small do they say what (17:01 - 17:05)
the size of the stickers were (17:03 - 17:07)
uh i mean they're not big they're pretty (17:05 - 17:08)
pictures (17:07 - 17:11)
they're just tiny they're probably maybe (17:08 - 17:15)
probably like an inch by 2.2 inch yeah (17:11 - 17:15)
uh but you had to bring your you had to (17:16 - 17:21)
bring your (17:20 - 17:24)
memory card or your cartridge um (17:21 - 17:26)
there was an instant memory card inside (17:24 - 17:28)
so you had to look (17:26 - 17:34)
let me blow up this picture jeez (17:28 - 17:34)
but i think that would be cool to like (17:35 - 17:40)
take your switch photos (17:37 - 17:43)
get some good ones send them to uh (17:40 - 17:46)
walgreens print them and then go (17:43 - 17:49)
childhood and then never probably do it (17:46 - 17:49)
again (17:49 - 17:53)
hey childhood okay i'm quick (17:49 - 17:54)
scanning to see if they have a price (17:53 - 17:56)
listed in here (17:54 - 17:58)
maybe i will decorate my new office with (17:56 - 17:59)
uh (17:58 - 18:04)
pokemon snap photos in frames (17:59 - 18:04)
slot your cartridge into the (18:04 - 18:11)
machine it was the cartridge yep (18:08 - 18:14)
because some 64 games would like very (18:11 - 18:15)
few (18:14 - 18:18)
64 games saved to the cart but a lot of (18:15 - 18:20)
them needed a memory card (18:18 - 18:24)
yeah yeah i don't yeah snap did not need (18:20 - 18:26)
a memory card (18:24 - 18:27)
and you would put the memory card into (18:26 - 18:29)
the controller wait did you or was it (18:27 - 18:30)
yeah (18:29 - 18:32)
no the front the front was that (18:30 - 18:34)
expansion pack for donkey kong or (18:32 - 18:36)
whatever (18:34 - 18:36)
uh there's no price listed in this (18:37 - 18:41)
article (18:39 - 18:43)
all right well if you find the price let (18:41 - 18:45)
us know uh the the article i have here (18:43 - 18:47)
from ign is new pokemon snap this is the (18:45 - 18:47)
title (18:47 - 18:50)
new party that's a sheet three dollars (18:47 - 18:51)
that's not that bad (18:50 - 18:54)
no your parents were three dollars and (18:51 - 18:55)
two thousand (18:54 - 18:58)
is like 45 dollars in 2021 (18:55 - 19:04)
so new pokemon snap was given to bandai (18:58 - 19:08)
namco because of pokken tournament (19:04 - 19:08)
what what there's a stage in poke well (19:08 - 19:16)
namco nam ko bandai namco (19:12 - 19:19)
made both they make uh katamari damasi (19:16 - 19:20)
greatest video game of all time (19:19 - 19:23)
yes continue uh there's a stage in pokey (19:20 - 19:24)
tournament (19:23 - 19:26)
called neos city where if you take your (19:24 - 19:28)
eyes off the fighting game (19:26 - 19:29)
action for a moment you will see a (19:28 - 19:31)
larger pokemon the larger pokemon world (19:29 - 19:32)
beyond the (19:31 - 19:34)
arena pokemon and humans walk side by (19:32 - 19:36)
side down the street there are shops (19:34 - 19:38)
signs vehicles billboards (19:36 - 19:39)
hint at pokemon living together (19:38 - 19:41)
alongside humans (19:39 - 19:44)
in another stage a magikarp festival is (19:41 - 19:45)
in full swing (19:44 - 19:47)
and in another pokemon in humans lays (19:45 - 19:48)
about in an old city square (19:47 - 19:51)
there's a serene wobba fett laying on (19:48 - 19:54)
the on the bench in the background (19:51 - 19:56)
uh and then they kind of talk about how (19:54 - 19:57)
you know pokemon (19:56 - 19:59)
in the background you know seamless (19:57 - 20:01)
detective pikachu pokemon go that kind (19:59 - 20:04)
of stuff (20:01 - 20:04)
and the quote here is pokken tournament (20:05 - 20:11)
utilized band bandai namco studio (20:08 - 20:11)
strengths (20:11 - 20:13)
and it made pokemon appealing in new (20:11 - 20:16)
ways he said ahi being the (20:13 - 20:21)
sorry the snap director suzuki (20:16 - 20:23)
because of this we had another great (20:21 - 20:24)
opportunity to do something together (20:23 - 20:26)
again this led to the development of new (20:24 - 20:26)
pokemon snap (20:26 - 20:28)
we were able to talk with the original (20:26 - 20:30)
developers of the game (20:28 - 20:32)
and we started the project that's the (20:30 - 20:34)
project started with the involvement (20:32 - 20:37)
of many people suzuki (20:34 - 20:40)
also affirms that my theory about making (20:37 - 20:42)
pokemon a seamless part of the world is (20:40 - 20:43)
correct the original pokemon snap did (20:42 - 20:44)
this (20:43 - 20:47)
um they're the author is talking about (20:44 - 20:49)
themselves (20:47 - 20:53)
but there was limited technology back 22 (20:49 - 20:54)
years ago (20:53 - 20:55)
new pokemon snap can make pokemon look (20:54 - 20:58)
better (20:55 - 20:58)
suzuki says the main focus was to build (20:58 - 21:02)
a world where pokemon (21:01 - 21:04)
actually live in the game to do this we (21:02 - 21:05)
first set out (21:04 - 21:07)
to create an exciting world by thinking (21:05 - 21:09)
about environments in which pokemon live (21:07 - 21:11)
creating the scenery detail using the (21:09 - 21:13)
switch's hardware capabilities the (21:11 - 21:14)
fullest (21:13 - 21:16)
uh while doing so we tried to make (21:14 - 21:18)
pokemon the star of the game by (21:16 - 21:20)
making them move naturally and making (21:18 - 21:22)
them feel the presence that is so fun to (21:20 - 21:23)
watch (21:22 - 21:27)
and is even more fun to take pictures (21:23 - 21:29)
suzuki said another key focus of the (21:27 - 21:30)
team in creating the sequel was (21:29 - 21:32)
increasing the number of pokemon that's (21:30 - 21:33)
not a (21:32 - 21:36)
it's a hard thing to do the original (21:33 - 21:39)
snap only had 63 of 151 pokemon some (21:36 - 21:40)
trivia here if you (21:39 - 21:43)
they meant to have 64 pokemon because it (21:40 - 21:45)
was the nintendo 64 but atkins (21:43 - 21:47)
wasn't working so they had to cut atkins (21:45 - 21:49)
last minute that's why they're 63. (21:47 - 21:52)
there's your trivia um now somewhere (21:49 - 21:52)
over (21:52 - 21:55)
uh we the author says there's over 800 (21:52 - 21:56)
pokemon (21:55 - 22:00)
miss rebecca there's 898 pokemon right (21:56 - 22:01)
now that's (22:00 - 22:04)
over 800 pokemon what did you expect (22:01 - 22:07)
just type 8.98 no (22:04 - 22:10)
i would just say there's two less than (22:07 - 22:12)
900 pokemon right now that would be a (22:10 - 22:15)
better thing (22:12 - 22:15)
accuracy we are just shy of 900 pokemon (22:15 - 22:21)
uh the number (22:18 - 22:21)
new pokemons uh new pokemon snap has the (22:22 - 22:26)
opportunity to feature more uh (22:24 - 22:29)
over 200 in fact suzuki told game (22:26 - 22:30)
informer (22:29 - 22:34)
which is what probably means what 202. (22:30 - 22:38)
yeah 202. 203 tops 298. obviously that's (22:34 - 22:42)
what over 200 means (22:38 - 22:46)
898 it's over 200. (22:42 - 22:46)
after years of silence uh but for the (22:47 - 22:52)
quiet release of original pokemon snap (22:50 - 22:53)
on the wii (22:52 - 22:56)
u virtual console in 2017 new pokemon (22:53 - 22:58)
snap received a (22:56 - 23:01)
wave of social media new pokemon snap (22:58 - 23:03)
was received with a wave of social media (23:01 - 23:04)
excitement upon its announcement last (23:03 - 23:06)
year especially from fans fond of the (23:04 - 23:07)
original (23:06 - 23:10)
suzuki suggests ban bandai namco was (23:07 - 23:12)
well aware of global fan (23:10 - 23:14)
interest in pokemon snap and points to (23:12 - 23:16)
the capabilities of the switch was a key (23:14 - 23:17)
reason why now was a good time to make (23:16 - 23:19)
an entry (23:17 - 23:21)
but he also notes that the ideal of (23:19 - 23:22)
photography has changed (23:21 - 23:25)
so much in the last 20 years indicating (23:22 - 23:26)
that these shifts were also a (23:25 - 23:27)
significant motive (23:26 - 23:30)
motivator in bringing pokemon snap back (23:27 - 23:32)
though he didn't elaborate on this point (23:30 - 23:34)
it is already at least somewhat visible (23:32 - 23:36)
in the photo editing mode we've seen (23:34 - 23:37)
prior to pokemon snap previews (23:36 - 23:39)
as well as the shift of printing out (23:37 - 23:41)
photos at blockbuster kiosks (23:39 - 23:43)
to share them to social media via the (23:41 - 23:47)
switch's built-in image features (23:43 - 23:47)
another key change from the original (23:48 - 23:52)
pokemon snap that fans have maybe picked (23:50 - 23:53)
up on is the lack of (23:52 - 23:55)
pester balls which were little balls (23:53 - 23:58)
that exploded purple gas when thrown at (23:55 - 23:59)
pokemon irritating them (23:58 - 24:02)
the more subtle ship from apples to (23:59 - 24:03)
fluff fruit (24:02 - 24:06)
uh an item that was thrown to entice (24:03 - 24:06)
pokemon (24:06 - 24:08)
and in our preview i was told that fluff (24:06 - 24:10)
fruit explicitly (24:08 - 24:12)
explicitly doesn't hurt the pokemon if (24:10 - 24:13)
it's thrown at them (24:12 - 24:16)
yeah it's fluffy it's not hard like that (24:13 - 24:18)
oh that makes sense (24:16 - 24:21)
i get it now because getting a hit with (24:18 - 24:22)
an apple would hurt (24:21 - 24:25)
it hurts uh put simply there's a bit (24:22 - 24:27)
more emphasis on treating pokemon like (24:25 - 24:27)
well (24:27 - 24:28)
actual living creatures who don't (24:27 - 24:31)
deserve to have obnoxious irritating gas (24:28 - 24:34)
or painful solid objects lobbed at them (24:31 - 24:34)
when they're just (24:34 - 24:37)
vibing in their natural habitat they (24:34 - 24:40)
just deserve to be captured and (24:37 - 24:43)
fight each other suzuki didn't put that (24:40 - 24:44)
quite bluntly (24:43 - 24:46)
but there are there was a humane angle (24:44 - 24:48)
to these changes (24:46 - 24:50)
i'm sure peta will still be very upset (24:48 - 24:51)
with this they will be (24:50 - 24:54)
uh of course we of course we (24:51 - 24:56)
also thought about some modern changes (24:54 - 24:58)
that would need to be made the pester (24:56 - 24:59)
ball was an important element to bring (24:58 - 25:01)
out pokemon's reactions in the nintendo (24:59 - 25:03)
64 version of pokemon snap (25:01 - 25:05)
so we decided to add the role of the (25:03 - 25:06)
pester ball (25:05 - 25:09)
to the fur fruit in new pokemon snap (25:06 - 25:12)
even though fur fruit doesn't hurt when (25:09 - 25:13)
it hits a pokemon it makes sense that (25:12 - 25:16)
some sorry fluff fruit some pokemon (25:13 - 25:18)
don't like being hit by fluff fruit (25:16 - 25:20)
so we designed the item to leave it up (25:18 - 25:21)
to the players whether they want to (25:20 - 25:24)
place it near the pokemon or throw it (25:21 - 25:28)
at the pokemon um (25:24 - 25:30)
and then the last article the last (25:28 - 25:32)
paragraph here is it it seems there are (25:30 - 25:34)
far more changes (25:32 - 25:36)
to what fans of pokemon snap might (25:34 - 25:37)
expect (25:36 - 25:39)
than are immediately apparent on the (25:37 - 25:41)
service in our preview we saw the (25:39 - 25:43)
introduction of branching pathways (25:41 - 25:46)
in the aforementioned game informer (25:43 - 25:47)
article the development revealed that (25:46 - 25:48)
the player's (25:47 - 25:50)
research level will increase oh we (25:48 - 25:51)
didn't talk about that in the trailer (25:50 - 25:52)
there's like a research level (25:51 - 25:55)
um new pokemon might appear in areas not (25:52 - 25:56)
previously seen (25:55 - 25:58)
new exhibits of behavior weren't (25:56 - 26:00)
available from before (25:58 - 26:02)
and with all the pokemon in existence to (26:00 - 26:04)
choose from uh new pokemon snap could be (26:02 - 26:06)
ripe for dlc (26:04 - 26:08)
and (26:06 - 26:08)
yeah any any video game could be right (26:09 - 26:12)
for dlc unfortunately (26:11 - 26:16)
for dlc photo decks (26:12 - 26:18)
unfortunately suzuki did respond to my (26:16 - 26:20)
question about this by simply telling me (26:18 - 26:22)
they had nothing to share on the topic (26:20 - 26:23)
at this time (26:22 - 26:27)
so there's your dlc whatever (26:23 - 26:30)
spoiler is that like that's like a (26:27 - 26:31)
common thing in like every interview (26:30 - 26:33)
like new game coming out (26:31 - 26:36)
is there gonna be dlc this time company (26:33 - 26:37)
if the game does really well (26:36 - 26:42)
heck yeah if the game doesn't happen (26:37 - 26:42)
um the thing i'm confused about though (26:44 - 26:52)
is i what i hear a lot is (26:49 - 26:55)
people will like hack games and then (26:52 - 26:57)
they'll be like oh i can see all of this (26:55 - 26:58)
stuff that's going to be dlc (26:57 - 27:00)
because it's in the code for the main (26:58 - 27:03)
game does it have to be there (27:00 - 27:05)
or can they do dlc that's like ha ha (27:03 - 27:06)
surprise (27:05 - 27:08)
you weren't right they can do that (27:06 - 27:10)
second kind because that's what they did (27:08 - 27:11)
with um (27:10 - 27:14)
mario kart when they did the two extra (27:11 - 27:16)
things there and then that's what they (27:14 - 27:19)
do for smash brothers (27:16 - 27:22)
well with um sword and shield (27:19 - 27:24)
there was only a couple pokemon that (27:22 - 27:25)
were available (27:24 - 27:27)
in the game hidden which was like the (27:25 - 27:28)
gigantomax (27:27 - 27:32)
smell metal for example um but the isle (27:28 - 27:34)
of armor and crown tundra were not (27:32 - 27:37)
in the the game code until like a week (27:34 - 27:38)
before (27:37 - 27:40)
so so nobody could see oh they're going (27:38 - 27:42)
to add these pokemon in (27:40 - 27:44)
correct okay okay okay yeah yeah and (27:42 - 27:46)
then once the crown tundra (27:44 - 27:48)
sorry once the isle of armor got added (27:46 - 27:49)
the crown tundra was there (27:48 - 27:53)
it was just hidden and you could see (27:49 - 27:54)
you could see all the pokemon being (27:53 - 27:56)
planned for crown tundra (27:54 - 27:59)
uh when the data mine happened but they (27:56 - 28:00)
scrubbed out (27:59 - 28:05)
they just had holders for the horses (28:00 - 28:06)
so they people knew that there were (28:05 - 28:08)
going to be two new legendary pokemon (28:06 - 28:09)
but they didn't know (28:08 - 28:13)
what they were going to be yeah okay (28:09 - 28:13)
i i am never on that like bandwagon of (28:15 - 28:22)
i need dlc before a game even comes out (28:19 - 28:23)
because i don't know if the game is (28:22 - 28:24)
going to be good (28:23 - 28:28)
like so i guess i guess i guess we'll (28:24 - 28:28)
see (28:28 - 28:31)
we'll see uh i'm excited for snap though (28:28 - 28:33)
i think it looks cool (28:31 - 28:35)
i'm probably gonna get it yeah i don't (28:33 - 28:37)
think it's gonna be (28:35 - 28:37)
somebody came in my twitch stream and (28:37 - 28:40)
they're like are you gonna play snap (28:38 - 28:41)
until diamond pearl came out and i kind (28:40 - 28:43)
of laughed i was like oh boy i don't (28:41 - 28:44)
think (28:43 - 28:45)
i'll be lucky if i'm playing snap after (28:44 - 28:48)
a week yeah it's not gonna be that much (28:45 - 28:49)
content (28:48 - 28:52)
uh the release date falls after the 19th (28:49 - 28:55)
and that is past the time that i can (28:52 - 28:58)
purchase things from myself (28:55 - 29:01)
you weren't going to get anyways greg i (28:58 - 29:02)
mean (29:01 - 29:04)
that didn't help (29:02 - 29:04)
it looks like a wish list y'all could (29:06 - 29:09)
buy it for me for my birthday if you (29:08 - 29:11)
really wanted me to play it (29:09 - 29:13)
but when i say like a game like i i (29:11 - 29:14)
don't expect to play the game after a (29:13 - 29:15)
week (29:14 - 29:16)
one i hope i'm wrong on that i hope (29:15 - 29:18)
there's like so much replayability that (29:16 - 29:20)
there's things to do but two that's not (29:18 - 29:21)
like a bad thing like i picked up an (29:20 - 29:24)
uncharted two one two three and four and (29:21 - 29:26)
they were all sixty dollars and i (29:24 - 29:27)
played them over the course of three or (29:26 - 29:30)
four days and i enjoyed them and then i (29:27 - 29:31)
never touched them again (29:30 - 29:32)
i didn't feel like i got ripped off it (29:31 - 29:34)
was just like i played through the game (29:32 - 29:36)
i liked the gameplay i liked the story (29:34 - 29:40)
it was good but i have no desire to (29:36 - 29:42)
replay uncharted 4 again like i know (29:40 - 29:43)
what happens but (29:42 - 29:46)
i don't think i wasted the 60 so i think (29:43 - 29:49)
i i think for sure i will get (29:46 - 29:50)
huge enjoyment out of pokemons now i (29:49 - 29:53)
think i'll get my 60 worth easy (29:50 - 29:56)
but yeah i don't expect to be playing it (29:53 - 29:57)
every day for the next (29:56 - 29:58)
two months yeah i'm just hoping it (29:57 - 30:00)
redeems my initial when i (29:58 - 30:03)
rented pokemon snap from potomac video (30:00 - 30:05)
in washington dc and i played it for two (30:03 - 30:06)
days and i was like (30:05 - 30:09)
i i can't i don't understand this game (30:06 - 30:09)
and i don't (30:09 - 30:12)
know this is not fun and i brought it (30:09 - 30:14)
back in (30:12 - 30:14)
i mean i'm gonna be watching people play (30:17 - 30:20)
it so (30:18 - 30:23)
i just i i hope that there's not i know (30:20 - 30:24)
what's going to happen there's (30:23 - 30:26)
leaderboards in this game so somebody's (30:24 - 30:27)
going to figure out the (30:26 - 30:30)
optimal way oh yeah to (30:27 - 30:32)
get max points on a picture and then (30:30 - 30:33)
it's going to be like (30:32 - 30:36)
the top 100 people are going to have 999 (30:33 - 30:37)
999 (30:36 - 30:39)
the same photo yeah yeah it's gonna be (30:37 - 30:40)

shiny charizard that's hidden in the (30:40 - 30:44)
game (30:42 - 30:44)

middle of the program (34:23 - 34:28)
go ahead leave a review on that one (34:24 - 34:30)
perfect uh the other thing i wanted to (34:28 - 34:31)
mention (34:30 - 34:34)
is that for so ise has been a thing for (34:31 - 34:36)
almost 11 years (34:34 - 34:39)
it'll be 11 years this january uh and i (34:36 - 34:41)
have (34:39 - 34:44)
july boy i'm just time (34:41 - 34:46)
i should be talking i should not be (34:44 - 34:48)
talking for a living i don't know how i (34:46 - 34:48)
got (34:48 - 34:50)
into this field but i'm very bad at it (34:48 - 34:52)
well the thing is you're better at (34:50 - 34:53)
talking than you are at reading (34:52 - 34:56)
so if that was your choice i would have (34:53 - 34:57)
done the right (34:56 - 34:59)
i wasn't reading anything when i said (34:57 - 35:01)
that (34:59 - 35:01)
uh so in the last couple weeks i've been (35:01 - 35:05)
talking to different advertising (35:04 - 35:06)
companies (35:05 - 35:08)
there's a lot of you normally if you (35:06 - 35:09)
listen to a podcast (35:08 - 35:13)
there's ads at the front middle and (35:09 - 35:16)
um and i have denied a lot of (35:13 - 35:18)
advertising companies over the years (35:16 - 35:20)
because i didn't like (35:18 - 35:22)
the ads they wanted to put onto the show (35:20 - 35:23)
even though (35:22 - 35:26)
they offered me money because i care (35:23 - 35:28)
about the show (35:26 - 35:32)
and so i would rather just make no money (35:28 - 35:33)
instead of having you guys suffer to (35:32 - 35:35)
make some money (35:33 - 35:38)
um but over the weekend i think i've (35:35 - 35:38)
found (35:38 - 35:41)
a company and the only reason i'm being (35:38 - 35:42)
bringing this up is just being (35:41 - 35:44)
transparent because if (35:42 - 35:46)
you start hearing ads that would be the (35:44 - 35:48)
thing but (35:46 - 35:51)
um maybe you know (35:48 - 35:54)
nothing works out maybe maybe there is (35:51 - 35:55)
nothing (35:54 - 35:57)
but i do get that question every now and (35:55 - 35:58)
then especially (35:57 - 36:00)
on twitch or in the slack where people (35:58 - 36:03)
are like why doesn't your show run ads (36:00 - 36:05)
and i've talked about that at length of (36:03 - 36:06)
you know (36:05 - 36:10)
deals that they wanted to but i didn't (36:06 - 36:11)
like the ads they (36:10 - 36:13)
wanted to i didn't have a choice in the (36:11 - 36:15)
ads they wanted to run and when i saw (36:13 - 36:16)
the ads i was like oh (36:15 - 36:20)
no um so if that's the thing (36:16 - 36:22)
so the other reason i bring that up is (36:20 - 36:23)
only because (36:22 - 36:25)
uh starting in may we're gonna revamp (36:23 - 36:27)
the patreon (36:25 - 36:29)
i think we have seven tiers of rewards (36:27 - 36:30)
we're probably going to bring it down to (36:29 - 36:31)
four (36:30 - 36:35)
and then one of the the base tier (36:31 - 36:37)
would be an ad-free version of the show (36:35 - 36:39)
so if we do decide to go with ads (36:37 - 36:41)
and you don't want ads the patreon will (36:39 - 36:42)
have like a five dollar a month (36:41 - 36:45)
get the show ad free you get to support (36:42 - 36:46)
it you get to join the slack pretty much (36:45 - 36:47)
the same thing (36:46 - 36:50)
but i want the i want the we haven't (36:47 - 36:52)
revamped the rewards in patreon in like (36:50 - 36:53)
two years (36:52 - 36:55)
and i want to revamp them to make them (36:53 - 36:57)
feel more (36:55 - 37:01)
fulfilling because like right now if you (36:57 - 37:02)
if you do like the two dollars you get (37:01 - 37:04)
to join the slack but if you don't care (37:02 - 37:05)
about the slack you're not really (37:04 - 37:07)
getting anything (37:05 - 37:09)
whereas in this case for like five (37:07 - 37:11)
dollars you get to join the slack (37:09 - 37:14)
or you get and or you get ad-free maybe (37:11 - 37:15)
you don't care about either (37:14 - 37:16)
maybe you just want to give me five (37:15 - 37:19)
dollars a month that's possible (37:16 - 37:23)
probably not not possible but um (37:19 - 37:25)
yeah so we're gonna be revamping that (37:23 - 37:27)
kind of stuff uh greg those appleton (37:25 - 37:28)
plushies don't buy themselves (37:27 - 37:31)
that's true i mean look at the wasteful (37:28 - 37:32)
spending (37:31 - 37:36)
i don't know if i'd call that waste (37:32 - 37:39)
that's a pretty i i don't like stuffed (37:36 - 37:40)
animals but that appleton is just (37:39 - 37:43)
calling to me (37:40 - 37:45)
i was telling i was telling uh twitch (37:43 - 37:47)
chat the other day will that you only (37:45 - 37:48)
have like one pokemon plush and it's a (37:47 - 37:51)
cyndaquil that i got you that is (37:48 - 37:54)
incorrect oh i have a (37:51 - 37:59)
uh sableye and i have a (37:54 - 38:03)
flabebe so you're up to three now and i (37:59 - 38:06)
have a victini oh you're up to four (38:03 - 38:09)
this is where it starts i mean if that's (38:06 - 38:12)
four over ten years now you're gonna you (38:09 - 38:13)
then you're gonna have a huge shelf of (38:12 - 38:14)
it (38:13 - 38:15)
and then you're gonna have a basket well (38:14 - 38:17)
in in the new (38:15 - 38:19)
recording studio that is being set up (38:17 - 38:20)
right now my shelf (38:19 - 38:23)
of stuffed animals and other memorabilia (38:20 - 38:25)
will be visible (38:23 - 38:28)
as i record in the current layout plan (38:25 - 38:29)
so you will not only see (38:28 - 38:32)
my uh pokemon stuffed animals you will (38:29 - 38:34)
also see my monster hunter stuffed (38:32 - 38:36)
animals (38:34 - 38:39)
my uh georgetown memorabilia for (38:36 - 38:41)
having been a university employee for (38:39 - 38:43)
longer than most of our listeners have (38:41 - 38:45)
been alive (38:43 - 38:48)
uh nice and (38:45 - 38:51)
my uh xerneas and evel tall uh (38:48 - 38:54)
figures of resin figure things that i (38:51 - 38:55)
never took out of the box (38:54 - 38:59)
they're just dusty (38:55 - 38:59)
so anyways nothing to be alarmed about (38:59 - 39:02)
for the (39:01 - 39:04)
the future of the show but uh i'll (39:02 - 39:06)
probably send a uh (39:04 - 39:08)
thingy a thingy an email to anyone's (39:06 - 39:09)
just (39:08 - 39:13)
listening out my my (39:09 - 39:13)
the revamp and what to expect also if (39:13 - 39:16)
you're (39:16 - 39:20)
already a patron and we change rewards (39:16 - 39:23)
every reward will be grandfathered in so (39:20 - 39:23)
like (39:23 - 39:25)
if you're already a producer and we (39:23 - 39:26)
changed the producer from (39:25 - 39:29)
45 or 46 i'm not gonna be like i need (39:26 - 39:32)
that extra dollar from you it'll all be (39:29 - 39:34)
this is my time to finally stop giving (39:32 - 39:38)
you money finally (39:34 - 39:38)
i think all three of us i give him the (39:38 - 39:44)
most yes (39:40 - 39:47)
i don't know how we got in the situation (39:44 - 39:49)
we're going to end it now (39:47 - 39:52)
lawsuit will change everything (39:49 - 39:55)

in-game (43:23 - 43:25)

campaign in the real world those rewards (43:27 - 43:32)

uh from 10 a.m to 8 p.m and the tier one (43:32 - 43:39)
which is 2500 activations will unlock (43:36 - 43:41)
five-star raids appearing more often a (43:39 - 43:43)
tier two which is five thousand (43:41 - 43:44)
activations (43:43 - 43:46)
a free bundle of three remote raid (43:44 - 43:48)

two times the catch bonus and all the (43:51 - 43:57)
rewards from tier one and tier two (43:54 - 43:57)
i don't know what (43:57 - 44:04)
that means what do you mean (44:01 - 44:06)
like an activation is like you actually (44:04 - 44:07)
picking up (44:06 - 44:11)
real life garbage right yeah so (44:07 - 44:14)
looking at their thing is based on (44:11 - 44:15)
social sharing (44:14 - 44:17)
and the impactful actions taken by (44:15 - 44:18)
individuals (44:17 - 44:22)
will unlock in-game tier rewards so (44:18 - 44:25)
you have to show yourself doing this (44:22 - 44:28)
on social media i guess (44:25 - 44:32)
but 2500 seems kind of low (44:28 - 44:32)
like 2 500 people picking up trash would (44:33 - 44:39)
they want more people to pick up trash (44:36 - 44:41)
uh i mean that's a lot more people than (44:39 - 44:43)
pick up trash on an average day (44:41 - 44:45)
[Laughter] (44:43 - 44:51)
i mean i'm gonna say that the um (44:45 - 44:53)
the sharing part of it is the part that (44:51 - 44:55)
they probably will have a tough time (44:53 - 44:57)
uh getting people to do post pictures of (44:55 - 44:58)
themselves on (44:57 - 45:00)
on a social media like i'm sure the (44:58 - 45:02)
social media team only wants to scroll (45:00 - 45:04)
through so many things trying to find (45:02 - 45:07)
examples of people doing this (45:04 - 45:09)
plus they want they want it to be easy (45:07 - 45:10)
tears so they can (45:09 - 45:12)
have a big hype that you know they're (45:10 - 45:14)
taking care of the planet (45:12 - 45:17)
despite you know being on phones that (45:14 - 45:21)
are conceivably terrible for the planet (45:17 - 45:24)
there's like uh tick tock or um (45:21 - 45:26)
reddit live reddit live is like a thing (45:24 - 45:28)
where people pick up trash (45:26 - 45:31)
and they stream it remember you've never (45:28 - 45:32)
been on reddit where they have (45:31 - 45:34)
first of all i don't know that's correct (45:32 - 45:35)
i've never been on reddit okay (45:34 - 45:38)
so if you're on like read it live if (45:35 - 45:39)
you're on like (45:38 - 45:42)
bad if you're on like mobile reddit (45:39 - 45:44)
it'll show you all your normal posts (45:42 - 45:47)
like i subscribe to like r slash destiny (45:44 - 45:47)
or r (45:47 - 45:49)
monster hunter and then so those get (45:47 - 45:51)
filtered in i heard you're not supposed (45:49 - 45:52)
to go on normal reddit you're supposed (45:51 - 45:53)
to go on (45:52 - 45:55)
like artillery the reddit client or (45:53 - 45:56)
something (45:55 - 45:58)
i don't have artillery but if the app (45:56 - 46:00)
existed i would download it (45:58 - 46:03)
uh look i got reddit gold so i got like (46:00 - 46:04)
eight years of reddit gold because i (46:03 - 46:06)
used to be on some other app that reddit (46:04 - 46:08)
bought and then read it was like here's (46:06 - 46:10)
eight years anyways when you go through (46:08 - 46:12)
it will show you (46:10 - 46:14)
it will like randomly put in live so it (46:12 - 46:16)
looks like a normal reddit post but it (46:14 - 46:17)
says live (46:16 - 46:18)
and then you tap on it and then it's (46:17 - 46:20)
like live video (46:18 - 46:23)
like in the shape of instagram or (46:20 - 46:26)
tic toc okay okay and there's (46:23 - 46:28)
it's almost all people like playing (46:26 - 46:30)
guitar playing piano (46:28 - 46:32)
it's like mostly music people but (46:30 - 46:33)
there's always a couple people that (46:32 - 46:35)
stick their phone at the end of like a (46:33 - 46:38)
claw and then they're walking around (46:35 - 46:38)
their city (46:38 - 46:41)
picking up trash so you're like just (46:38 - 46:42)
this yeah (46:41 - 46:45)
i was like this is this this is weird (46:42 - 46:46)
and then i (46:45 - 46:47)
just found myself watching it and it was (46:46 - 46:50)
like yeah it's the asmr dudes it's the (46:47 - 46:51)
asmr people (46:50 - 46:53)
property brothers for fun but it was (46:51 - 46:55)
like all so inspiring of like this (46:53 - 46:57)
dude's picking up trash in his (46:55 - 46:58)
neighborhood that's so cool (46:57 - 47:01)
also i kind of want to pick up trash in (46:58 - 47:02)
my neighborhood (47:01 - 47:04)
oh hey if you are inspired to pick up (47:02 - 47:06)
trash i will give you my home address (47:04 - 47:07)
because (47:06 - 47:09)
the people who were there before left (47:07 - 47:10)
all kinds of chick-fil-a wrappers and (47:09 - 47:12)
all kinds of stuff that i want on my (47:10 - 47:14)
lawn (47:12 - 47:17)
it was it was very inspiring but it's (47:14 - 47:19)
just like a nice thing to do pick up (47:17 - 47:21)
trash (47:19 - 47:23)
and then you can upload it and so the (47:21 - 47:24)
thing on reddit live is (47:23 - 47:26)
like because reddit has their little (47:24 - 47:28)
awards (47:26 - 47:30)
like you give people reddit go gold or (47:28 - 47:32)
reddit silver or reddit hugs (47:30 - 47:34)
don't you have to pay for that stuff you (47:32 - 47:35)
do (47:34 - 47:38)
see this is a scheme (47:35 - 47:40)
but when you give them like reddit gold (47:38 - 47:42)
they get more air time (47:40 - 47:46)
and they're featured longer (47:42 - 47:49)
on the app and it's very it's (47:46 - 47:53)
it's weird yes yes this is very weird (47:49 - 47:56)
look i didn't live through ten years of (47:53 - 47:58)
a crying native american (47:56 - 48:01)
to go out and pick up trash correct (47:58 - 48:04)
you had no idea how much trash it was in (48:01 - 48:04)
the seventies (48:04 - 48:08)
television community (48:04 - 48:08)
the world you live in is so clean oh man (48:08 - 48:14)
it's just like you don't have native (48:12 - 48:16)
americans standing in your corner crying (48:14 - 48:16)
anymore (48:16 - 48:19)
i was so validated when some random (48:16 - 48:20)
woman (48:19 - 48:23)
said to me just confirmed she's like you (48:20 - 48:24)
know (48:23 - 48:26)
i she said the same thing that i always (48:24 - 48:27)
think i was like i lived through the 70s (48:26 - 48:29)
be happy i just didn't throw the wrapper (48:27 - 48:30)
on the ground (48:29 - 48:33)
i just like that is what we were taught (48:30 - 48:36)
yeah there were no there's no outside (48:33 - 48:37)
garbage cans (48:36 - 48:42)
the outside was the garbage can exactly (48:37 - 48:42)
be happy i don't check it out of the car (48:43 - 48:46)
anymore (48:45 - 48:49)
oh man (48:46 - 48:51)
well wisconsin right now we have all the (48:49 - 48:53)
snow melted so now all the like the (48:51 - 48:55)
trash is coming in (48:53 - 49:00)
yeah it's just you need a good windstorm (48:55 - 49:02)
and it all blows to everyone's house (49:00 - 49:04)
that put up a room it all into lake (49:02 - 49:05)
michigan (49:04 - 49:09)
exactly gosh i i (49:05 - 49:11)
we have we i've told this i think i've (49:09 - 49:12)
said this before we i have like low (49:11 - 49:14)
income apartments behind (49:12 - 49:19)
my house and the landlord (49:14 - 49:21)
like didn't shovel in front of the (49:19 - 49:23)
garbage cans (49:21 - 49:27)
so the the trash guys (49:23 - 49:29)
they like wouldn't take the garbage (49:27 - 49:30)
because they didn't (49:29 - 49:33)
want to try to dig the garbage cans out (49:30 - 49:34)
of the snow (49:33 - 49:37)
so for six weeks (49:34 - 49:39)
they never picked up the trash and so (49:37 - 49:42)
the people behind the apartments (49:39 - 49:44)
i mean to be fair it wasn't their (49:42 - 49:46)
responsibility to like (49:44 - 49:48)
shovel it out they could have i mean (49:46 - 49:50)
it's their technically home (49:48 - 49:53)
um technically the landlords so they (49:50 - 49:56)
would just throw the trash bags behind (49:53 - 49:58)
the trash cans because you couldn't put (49:56 - 50:00)
it in the trash can (49:58 - 50:02)
and the only reason that that eventually (50:00 - 50:04)
got cleaned up (50:02 - 50:08)
is because the snow eventually melted (50:04 - 50:11)
it was like the long con but i am one of (50:08 - 50:13)
the very few houses in my neighborhood (50:11 - 50:13)
that (50:13 - 50:18)
doesn't have a fence so when wind blows (50:13 - 50:22)
my yard is the res my yard is the uh (50:18 - 50:24)
where the some of the trash ends up so i (50:22 - 50:26)
have this internal debate of (50:24 - 50:29)
do i pick up the trash or do i check the (50:26 - 50:30)
weather app of whether it's going to be (50:29 - 50:33)
windy again and is it going to then (50:30 - 50:36)
blow up somebody else's problem well (50:33 - 50:36)
here (50:36 - 50:38)
film yourself picking up the trash in (50:36 - 50:40)
your backyard there you go and get (50:38 - 50:42)
freeze (50:40 - 50:42)
captain messi my backyard doesn't have (50:42 - 50:46)
any trash in it (50:45 - 50:48)
hey i picked up all the trash yesterday (50:46 - 50:51)
in my yard because i had to mow the lawn (50:48 - 50:54)
and my yard it's april look uh (50:51 - 50:55)
my lawn looks better than everyone (50:54 - 50:57)
else's lawn right now oh yeah greg when (50:55 - 50:59)
do i have to borrow your lawnmower (50:57 - 51:02)
what what month is that do i have may (50:59 - 51:04)
june you guys should probably get (51:02 - 51:05)
through mate depends on how cold may is (51:04 - 51:07)
but like nothing's growing right now (51:05 - 51:09)
because it's we keep going (51:07 - 51:11)
i got i got rabbits in my yard things i (51:09 - 51:14)
gotta wrap it in my yard (51:11 - 51:14)
dogs keep chasing them so the rabbits (51:14 - 51:19)
don't stay for long (51:17 - 51:20)
if you got rabbits in your yard you're (51:19 - 51:23)
mowing the grass way more often why (51:20 - 51:24)
because they're pooping and the pooping (51:23 - 51:26)
is making the grass grow (51:24 - 51:28)
i don't think that's how that works that (51:26 - 51:30)
is 100 true because they they poop in (51:28 - 51:31)
circles (51:30 - 51:33)
and then you have circles that grow this (51:31 - 51:34)
is a true thing (51:33 - 51:36)
what don't give me these looks this is (51:34 - 51:38)

i am doing a google search rabbits poop (51:56 - 52:00)
in circles i see (51:59 - 52:03)
nothing i see that their poop is (52:00 - 52:05)
perfectly round (52:03 - 52:07)
they have round poop it looks like (52:05 - 52:09)
kibble and the dogs try to eat it (52:07 - 52:12)
but i'm not seeing (52:09 - 52:12)
circles of rabbit poop i will take (52:12 - 52:17)
pictures of my yard (52:15 - 52:19)
look whatever whatever chemical (52:17 - 52:21)
treatment you're doing to your rabbits (52:19 - 52:25)
is not part of reality we (52:21 - 52:27)
we know you do weird things when you're (52:25 - 52:29)
bored you you stream from home you don't (52:27 - 52:30)
leave (52:29 - 52:32)
you go out there you convince rabbits to (52:30 - 52:33)
poop in circles (52:32 - 52:35)
as he's trained them exactly he's (52:33 - 52:37)
trained them to do that (52:35 - 52:39)
they used to be called crop circles now (52:37 - 52:40)
that's not what they're called anymore (52:39 - 52:42)
but i will say i will take advantage of (52:40 - 52:44)
this opportunity that if any of (52:42 - 52:46)
i i have not lived in a house in (52:44 - 52:47)
probably (52:46 - 52:50)
30 years um if any (52:47 - 52:55)
of our listeners have hot lawn care tips (52:50 - 52:57)

am out of my head (52:57 - 53:01)
i have no idea what i'm supposed to be (52:59 - 53:02)
doing although all they say is i'm (53:01 - 53:04)
responsible for the lawn (53:02 - 53:07)
what that means i've (53:04 - 53:10)
had a look at there's a lot of rocks (53:07 - 53:13)
i'm not sure what to do about the rocks (53:10 - 53:14)
like as (53:13 - 53:17)
in the grass or just rocks in the grass (53:14 - 53:19)
it's like it's almost like a prehistoric (53:17 - 53:20)
civilization (53:19 - 53:23)

adorable they're very very cute (59:45 - 59:51)
i'm super happy with them um (59:47 - 59:51)
these are these these were sold out on (59:52 - 59:55)
pokemon center (59:53 - 59:58)
but they were in stock at amazon (59:55 - 60:01)

noble in roseville (60:17 - 60:22)
probably probably for the for reference (60:19 - 60:24)
i don't think these books are going to (60:22 - 60:25)
be worth like (60:24 - 60:26)
i don't think you're supposed to put (60:25 - 60:27)
these books next to your ancient mew you (60:26 - 60:29)
could try you could try they have (60:27 - 60:32)
pikachu and charizard in that yeah you (60:29 - 60:34)
know let them let them appreciate and (60:32 - 60:35)
value next to those burger king gold (60:34 - 60:36)
coins (60:35 - 60:39)
uh i i don't think you're gold coins i (60:36 - 60:39)
don't i (60:39 - 60:41)
i legit don't think they're they got (60:39 - 60:44)
scalps from pokemon center i think (60:41 - 60:48)
just if there was a demand for this like (60:44 - 60:52)
there are so many people have had babies (60:48 - 60:55)
in the past three to four months (60:52 - 60:58)
and it's like a lot of those people are (60:55 - 60:59)
pokemon fans (60:58 - 61:02)
and said well now that i've got a baby (60:59 - 61:03)
i've got to accessorize (61:02 - 61:05)
yep and i might as well keep it in the (61:03 - 61:07)
franchise that i love (61:05 - 61:08)
isn't that already like a super hot (61:07 - 61:10)
industry anyways like if you make stuff (61:08 - 61:12)
for kids you are just (61:10 - 61:14)
yeah like that like that it has a lot of (61:12 - 61:16)
money in it just in general (61:14 - 61:18)
i mean people keep having kids although (61:16 - 61:19)
less than they have (61:18 - 61:22)
i make trebuchets for kids and i have (61:19 - 61:25)
not sold a single one (61:22 - 61:27)
i told you the marketing plan on those (61:25 - 61:28)
are not (61:27 - 61:31)
good we need to develop a better slogan (61:28 - 61:34)
fling your kid doesn't sell them (61:31 - 61:36)
i mean kids like to be flung i've seen (61:34 - 61:40)
that on the internet (61:36 - 61:40)
chilling rain speaking of things that (61:42 - 61:47)
will probably sell out (61:45 - 61:50)
new pokemon trading good (61:47 - 61:50)
i think it will be better than battle (61:51 - 61:55)
styles if that is your question (61:53 - 61:58)
uh and what spelling of rain (61:55 - 62:00)
what is the effect yeah the spelling of (61:58 - 62:03)
it it's the iha rain (62:00 - 62:07)
that's for the listener who's not (62:03 - 62:09)
watching you shake your hands like (62:07 - 62:11)
you're cheering on a barbecue pit (62:09 - 62:17)
[Laughter] (62:11 - 62:19)
r-e-i-g-n rain (62:17 - 62:22)
wait r-e-i-g-n is not the lane (62:19 - 62:24)
that is the king reign that is the king (62:22 - 62:26)
ring (62:24 - 62:28)
what's the thing that goes around its (62:26 - 62:30)
neck r-e-i-n (62:28 - 62:33)
r-e-i-n rain oh wait really (62:30 - 62:35)
yeah that's why i was been asking you (62:33 - 62:37)
when you keep saying it's me (62:35 - 62:39)
i'm like i'm seeing it not be the yeehaw (62:37 - 62:41)
one and i'm pretty sure reigns don't go (62:39 - 62:43)
they kind of go attached to the ladies (62:41 - 62:45)
in the mouth and why is (62:43 - 62:48)
english the worst language ever because (62:45 - 62:49)
it rains (62:48 - 62:51)
from multiple languages that's the (62:49 - 62:53)
problem so you got rain from the sky you (62:51 - 62:54)
got the eha (62:53 - 62:56)
rain you got the king rain yes this is (62:54 - 62:57)
all bad (62:56 - 63:00)
the problem is english is like the (62:57 - 63:01)
garbodor of languages (63:00 - 63:04)
it's just like anything it can grab onto (63:01 - 63:05)
and suck in (63:04 - 63:07)
it just does it and it's like hey did (63:05 - 63:08)
you know that knife has a silent k at (63:07 - 63:11)
the front (63:08 - 63:11)
so does knight yes (63:11 - 63:18)
my pikachu primer books don't teach me (63:15 - 63:19)
about (63:18 - 63:21)
the reigns what is it the roman reigns (63:19 - 63:24)
what does it have for the letter k (63:21 - 63:28)

a kingdom oh yeah i thought it was the (63:46 - 63:50)
yeehaw (63:49 - 63:52)
because you you put it it goes in the (63:50 - 63:53)
mouth not around the neck (63:52 - 63:55)

or create new ones (66:32 - 66:36)
centered around this powerful pokemon (66:34 - 66:38)
that will deliver exciting gameplay (66:36 - 66:39)
strategies (66:38 - 66:41)
in addition trainers can look forward to (66:39 - 66:42)
many new pokemon v (66:41 - 66:44)
and vmax including uh and featuring (66:42 - 66:46)
galerion articuno galerion zapdos and (66:44 - 66:48)
gallerian multrace (66:46 - 66:50)
available in booster packs special (66:48 - 66:51)
collections and two (66:50 - 66:53)
versions of elite trainer boxes it took (66:51 - 66:56)
them a real long to get to this point (66:53 - 66:58)
but they have now mastered putting out (66:56 - 67:00)
two different elite trainer boxes (66:58 - 67:01)
you would think they've been doing this (67:00 - 67:03)
since day one we put out a red we put (67:01 - 67:04)
out a blue we put out a gold we put out (67:03 - 67:05)
a silver (67:04 - 67:07)
now with battle styles we put out a red (67:05 - 67:09)
one with an hershey food and a blue one (67:07 - 67:10)
with a nerd shifu (67:09 - 67:12)
we got two more elite trainer boxes one (67:10 - 67:13)
with ice rider (67:12 - 67:16)
one with shadow rider it will include (67:13 - 67:20)
eight condom eight v-max pokemon 15 (67:16 - 67:24)
v pokemon 26 full art v (67:20 - 67:27)
28 trainers 13 supporters 13 full (67:24 - 67:30)
art supporter cards three new special (67:27 - 67:32)
energy (67:30 - 67:32)
did i say how many cards in total i (67:33 - 67:38)
don't think they have nine (67:36 - 67:42)
70 new battle style cards but that's (67:38 - 67:45)
not all of the cards well my (67:42 - 67:50)
hot takes last prediction is either (67:45 - 67:52)
neither caloric's card will be any good (67:50 - 67:53)
at all (67:52 - 67:55)
or one of them will be really really (67:53 - 67:57)
good and they're gonna (67:55 - 68:00)
be really bad i think there are scans of (67:57 - 68:01)
them (68:00 - 68:04)
because they're they come out in japan (68:01 - 68:06)
at the end of the month i mean i'll link (68:04 - 68:08)
what i found and you tell me because i (68:06 - 68:09)
don't understand (68:08 - 68:11)
oh it depends on the decks you you can't (68:09 - 68:13)
just look at a card on its own (68:11 - 68:15)
and like look at it and say hey this is (68:13 - 68:16)
a good attacker hey (68:15 - 68:18)
yeah you can you can i have them here (68:16 - 68:20)
okay so um we'll start with ice rider (68:18 - 68:20)
calorics (68:20 - 68:23)
first off the art is very good dart is (68:20 - 68:24)
incredible um (68:23 - 68:28)
it's a water type we're looking at vmax (68:24 - 68:29)
here would be better if it didn't have (68:28 - 68:31)
calorics on it but sure (68:29 - 68:34)
so two colorless emperors ride (68:31 - 68:37)
10 damage plus this attack does 30 more (68:34 - 68:38)
damage for each of your opponent's bench (68:37 - 68:40)
pokemon (68:38 - 68:44)
so that is 30 60 (68:40 - 68:48)
90 120 150 plus 10 so 160 damage for two (68:44 - 68:50)
energy (68:48 - 68:53)
violates one of will anderson's (68:50 - 68:55)
fundamental rules of evaluating a (68:53 - 68:56)
trading card (68:55 - 68:58)
is if it depends on a decision your (68:56 - 69:00)
opponent made (68:58 - 69:02)
it's not good because all they have to (69:00 - 69:04)
do is not bench pokemon (69:02 - 69:06)
and all of a sudden this card's not (69:04 - 69:08)
doing nothing this attack isn't doing (69:06 - 69:08)
anything (69:08 - 69:12)
you're right but in this format (69:08 - 69:16)
currently benches are being fold (69:12 - 69:18)
because of de dene because of crobat (69:16 - 69:20)
because of gossip floor (69:18 - 69:22)
um benches are benches are stacked in (69:20 - 69:23)
this current format (69:22 - 69:27)
okay so if this is forcing people not to (69:23 - 69:27)
play (69:27 - 69:29)
that would be hurting current decks (69:27 - 69:31)
which is the goal (69:29 - 69:34)
um so for two water energies it's max (69:31 - 69:35)
lance (69:34 - 69:37)
10 damage plus you may discard up to two (69:35 - 69:39)
energy cards from this pokemon if you do (69:37 - 69:41)
this attack does 120 (69:39 - 69:44)
more damage for each energy card (69:41 - 69:44)
discarded (69:44 - 69:49)
in this way so you are doing 250 damage (69:44 - 69:52)
for two energy and discarding which is (69:49 - 69:55)
in my opinion incredibly good (69:52 - 69:55)
but if you have um yeah you can't (69:56 - 70:00)
discard three you may discard (69:59 - 70:03)
up to two so it caps at 250. but you (70:00 - 70:05)
could just do 130 (70:03 - 70:08)
for one energy discarding well yeah (70:05 - 70:10)
don't overdo (70:08 - 70:12)
and then so i i think that's good it's (70:10 - 70:14)
weak to metal pokemon (70:12 - 70:16)
um which isn't a super dominant type (70:14 - 70:17)
right now well (70:16 - 70:19)
there's mel metal is probably the the (70:17 - 70:21)
main metal deck (70:19 - 70:25)
shadow rider calorics uh has an ability (70:21 - 70:28)
called uh hell gate real weird that (70:25 - 70:29)
they're gonna go with that (70:28 - 70:31)
but we'll see how it's actually (70:29 - 70:32)
translated yeah (70:31 - 70:35)
exactly but that's what it is in japan (70:32 - 70:35)
uh (70:35 - 70:36)
i'm sure the pokemon company (70:35 - 70:38)
international doesn't want to go with (70:36 - 70:39)
that (70:38 - 70:41)
once during your turn you may attach one (70:39 - 70:43)
psychic energy (70:41 - 70:46)
uh from your hand to one of your benched (70:43 - 70:47)
psychic (70:46 - 70:50)
pokemon then draw two cards so that's (70:47 - 70:50)
good (70:50 - 70:52)
that's real nice any ability that lets (70:50 - 70:54)
you attach a free energy is good (70:52 - 70:56)
on top of also letting you draw cards (70:54 - 70:57)
very good (70:56 - 71:00)
um and then for three colorless so any (70:57 - 71:01)
energy you want (71:00 - 71:03)
max dice 10 plus damage this attack is (71:01 - 71:05)
30 more damage for each (71:03 - 71:07)
psychic energy attached to your pokemon (71:05 - 71:09)
in play (71:07 - 71:11)
so this is a very common mechanic that (71:09 - 71:12)
they use (71:11 - 71:14)
so if you have three psychic energy on (71:12 - 71:17)
calorics three psychic energy on (71:14 - 71:20)
a gore geist on your bench that's (71:17 - 71:24)
90 90 80 that's 190 damage (71:20 - 71:24)
between so i think both of these pokemon (71:25 - 71:30)
are good (71:27 - 71:30)
i think the shadow rider's better (71:30 - 71:37)
if you can slot it into a deck right (71:34 - 71:37)
they yeah they seem good they seem (71:42 - 71:45)
powerful yeah and also shadow writer's (71:43 - 71:46)
main attack (71:45 - 71:50)
is all colorless so it's more flexible (71:46 - 71:53)
than ice rider which has to have those (71:50 - 71:54)
water type (71:53 - 71:57)
energies well psychic is doing pretty (71:54 - 71:59)
good right now in the tcg because of (71:57 - 72:02)
mewbox which is mewtwo and (71:59 - 72:05)
mewtwo and mew tag team they can (72:02 - 72:07)
there's always there's not always but (72:05 - 72:09)
there's usually a mechanic (72:07 - 72:13)
that um that (72:09 - 72:14)
psychic pokemon sometimes have where (72:13 - 72:16)
they can take advantage of moves of (72:14 - 72:18)
pokemon in the discard pile (72:16 - 72:20)
so mew and mewtwo are the cardless (72:18 - 72:22)
formats so if you discard like a (72:20 - 72:24)
blaziken (72:22 - 72:26)
mewtwo's immusability is like look at (72:24 - 72:28)
that blazing card as long as you have (72:26 - 72:30)
the energy for it you can use that move (72:28 - 72:31)
yourself (72:30 - 72:34)
so the what why it's called the mewtwo (72:31 - 72:35)
or mew box (72:34 - 72:36)
is because you're taking a bunch of (72:35 - 72:38)
pokemon that don't matter with the (72:36 - 72:40)
intention of discarding them just so you (72:38 - 72:42)
can use their moves (72:40 - 72:46)
for your mewtwo and mew i don't remember (72:42 - 72:48)
the pokemon before mewtwo and mew it (72:46 - 72:50)
might have just been mew itself (72:48 - 72:52)
it might have been mu box before but now (72:50 - 72:54)
it's mewtwo view (72:52 - 72:56)
anyways these cards seem good that set (72:54 - 72:58)
comes out in june (72:56 - 73:00)
although japan gets this set in a week i (72:58 - 73:03)
think (73:00 - 73:03)
yeah that sounds good that's all the (73:05 - 73:10)
news we got (73:08 - 73:20)
that's it (73:10 - 73:20)
um question of the week greg (73:22 - 73:29)
okay what is the question of the week (73:25 - 73:33)
question of the week this week (73:29 - 73:35)
i don't know what that was i don't think (73:33 - 73:37)
it was dozier cat (73:35 - 73:39)
i don't i've never listened to joshua (73:37 - 73:41)
cat so i wouldn't know you probably have (73:39 - 73:42)
and didn't realize it (73:41 - 73:45)
that is possible (73:42 - 73:45)
can we bring back the uh (73:46 - 73:51)
the post malone concert that was really (73:49 - 73:53)
good yeah it's on youtube (73:51 - 73:56)
every night if that's what you want (73:53 - 73:59)
and then it keeps suggesting that i said (73:56 - 74:01)
watch it and i have to tell youtube (73:59 - 74:03)
i already watched this youtube's (74:01 - 74:05)
algorithm is noticeable it's so bad (74:03 - 74:08)
it's really bad it really is like i've (74:05 - 74:10)
watched post malone walk around singing (74:08 - 74:12)
his songs and the one song that's (74:10 - 74:16)
vaguely related to the 25th anniversary (74:12 - 74:18)
uh this is from chris do you think we (74:16 - 74:20)
will see apricorn balls and pokemon go (74:18 - 74:22)
and how would they be used (74:20 - 74:26)
which chris christie (74:22 - 74:29)
then the answer is no (74:26 - 74:31)
[Music] (74:29 - 74:33)
obviously they had their opportunity to (74:31 - 74:35)
do it when they (74:33 - 74:39)
did johto i mean like why (74:35 - 74:42)
why would they do that now i think (74:39 - 74:43)
apricorn balls (74:42 - 74:46)
add a level of complexity into pokemon (74:43 - 74:49)
go that they don't want (74:46 - 74:52)
i could see them adding apricorn balls (74:49 - 74:55)
and making them extremely extremely rare (74:52 - 74:56)
i mean they're pretty rare and sword (74:55 - 74:58)
shield (74:56 - 75:00)
um for what purpose what would they add (74:58 - 75:01)
them for (75:00 - 75:02)
like what is that going to do for the (75:01 - 75:05)
game you catch a (75:02 - 75:08)
weasel in a love ball and then you (75:05 - 75:10)
transfer it to pokemon home and now (75:08 - 75:12)
you put it into the weasel's not (75:10 - 75:14)
uncertain shield but if it was you put (75:12 - 75:15)
in a sword and chill now you can breed (75:14 - 75:17)
weasel in a live ball (75:15 - 75:20)
i mean that's like a super niche thing (75:17 - 75:21)
yeah it is (75:20 - 75:24)
not that's not like a selling point like (75:21 - 75:26)
a few people want to have more apricot (75:24 - 75:28)
balls for breeding is not a reason to (75:26 - 75:29)
add it to pokemon go (75:28 - 75:32)
like in the games they all did different (75:29 - 75:33)
things and those different things that (75:32 - 75:35)
they did were (75:33 - 75:37)
a broken because it was gen 2 a lot of (75:35 - 75:39)
the times yeah they didn't work (75:37 - 75:43)
don't don't really apply to how pokemon (75:39 - 75:44)
go (75:43 - 75:47)
works now yeah like (75:44 - 75:50)
i could maybe see an apricorn ball that (75:47 - 75:51)
would work more on an (75:50 - 75:53)
extra large or extra small except you (75:51 - 75:55)
don't get to see that until after (75:53 - 75:56)
they're caught (75:55 - 75:57)
so there's no way to make that (75:56 - 75:59)
determination before (75:57 - 76:02)
throwing it so it'd be decorative only (75:59 - 76:03)
and since you can (76:02 - 76:06)
only get premier balls through raids (76:03 - 76:08)
there would need to be a very specific (76:06 - 76:09)
reason to add these in and i (76:08 - 76:10)
don't think there's ever going to be a (76:09 - 76:12)
reason to add them in (76:10 - 76:16)
um well i would assume that like (76:12 - 76:17)
so pokemon go is eventually going to (76:16 - 76:20)
catch up with all the pokemon (76:17 - 76:22)
right eventually yeah so we're we're (76:20 - 76:23)
pretty much (76:22 - 76:26)
done with j well the the difference now (76:23 - 76:27)
compared to (76:26 - 76:30)
early pokemon go is gen 3 (76:27 - 76:34)
had 130 some pokemon gen 4 (76:30 - 76:37)
had 100 some pokemon gen 5 had 150 (76:34 - 76:38)
pokemon (76:37 - 76:41)
but now we're like now we're like in the (76:38 - 76:42)
70s and 80s (76:41 - 76:45)
yeah it's like very very slim so we're (76:42 - 76:46)
almost done with gen 6. (76:45 - 76:50)
gen 7 is probably going to be (76:46 - 76:54)
end of this year or early next year (76:50 - 76:56)
because they've been doing uh and then (76:54 - 76:57)
and then we're at gen eight but (76:56 - 77:00)
we've already seen some gen eight stuff (76:57 - 77:01)
uh sir fetch (77:00 - 77:05)
ponyta that kind of stuff (77:01 - 77:09)
so they will probably be caught up (77:05 - 77:12)
by the time gen 9 comes out and then (77:09 - 77:13)
finally they can do (77:12 - 77:17)
gen 9 in go and in (77:13 - 77:19)
video game form at the same time that (77:17 - 77:21)
would be my guess right (77:19 - 77:24)
sure uh maybe we get gen (77:21 - 77:28)
nine next year but i don't maybe (77:24 - 77:33)
like 2022 yeah yeah but maybe 2023 (77:28 - 77:35)
like a pokemon game doesn't always have (77:33 - 77:37)
to come out in fall (77:35 - 77:39)
right true like we got black and white (77:37 - 77:41)
in spring (77:39 - 77:45)
yes um and we're getting arceus (77:41 - 77:48)
legends and technically winter i guess (77:45 - 77:48)
but (77:48 - 77:51)
january january february march oh i'm so (77:48 - 77:52)
excited for that (77:51 - 77:57)
q1 whatever that means you won so march (77:52 - 77:57)
um but (77:57 - 78:02)
like the the more interesting question (78:00 - 78:05)
isn't like (78:02 - 78:05)
the apricorn balls the more interesting (78:05 - 78:08)
question is how do they get players to (78:07 - 78:09)
keep playing (78:08 - 78:11)
after they're caught up because they're (78:09 - 78:13)
not going to just end the game the game (78:11 - 78:14)
makes too much money and there's more (78:13 - 78:16)
things you can do (78:14 - 78:19)
so do you add different pokeballs just (78:16 - 78:20)
to keep those players (78:19 - 78:24)
engaged uh (78:20 - 78:26)
like how do you turn this into like they (78:24 - 78:27)
probably have a five-year plan (78:26 - 78:28)
but they probably also have a 10-year (78:27 - 78:32)
plan probably yeah (78:28 - 78:32)
so i could already i could they're just (78:33 - 78:36)
flying by the seat of their pants (78:34 - 78:38)
i can see them adding pokeball like (78:36 - 78:40)
different pokeballs just (78:38 - 78:43)
to add variety or just to have something (78:40 - 78:45)
to chase (78:43 - 78:48)
yeah i think probably maybe (78:45 - 78:52)
as rewards for research tasks (78:48 - 78:54)
yeah so like like in sword and shield if (78:52 - 78:56)
you care about apricorn balls they're (78:54 - 78:57)
rare (78:56 - 79:00)
but you can grind them out yeah you can (78:57 - 79:02)
like hit up all the trees every day (79:00 - 79:03)
hit up all the trees every day if you're (79:02 - 79:05)
impatient move your clock forward a day (79:03 - 79:07)
hit up all the trees and then just grind (79:05 - 79:08)
out the crown i mean cheat (79:07 - 79:10)
okay yeah um and you can get apricorn (79:08 - 79:12)
balls (79:10 - 79:15)
and i think the pokemon company is (79:12 - 79:17)
really smart in realizing people (79:15 - 79:20)
like these and that they've (79:17 - 79:23)
artificially made them rarer (79:20 - 79:25)
because in doing making and making them (79:23 - 79:26)
rare they give a (79:25 - 79:28)
they give another reason to chase it and (79:26 - 79:30)
they give another reason to breed and (79:28 - 79:32)
then they give another reason to trade (79:30 - 79:34)
like i only have two love balls i'm (79:32 - 79:35)
gonna use mine on a weasel (79:34 - 79:37)
and i'm going to use mine on a zubat (79:35 - 79:39)
greg is going to use his own roselia (79:37 - 79:42)
and spinorac and now we're going i'm (79:39 - 79:44)
going to trade one of my weasels for (79:42 - 79:45)
your spinner rack and now (79:44 - 79:47)
instead of having two pokemon love balls (79:45 - 79:49)
i have four and you have four (79:47 - 79:54)
i know greg desperately loves spinarak (79:49 - 79:54)
i feel like you don't know me anymore i (79:56 - 80:01)
feel like we've reached the point in a (79:59 - 80:03)
relationship where you're just making (80:01 - 80:04)
things up about me (80:03 - 80:06)
i know that greg likes spinner rack more (80:04 - 80:08)
than he likes probopass (80:06 - 80:12)
oh yeah everything before bro exactly (80:08 - 80:14)
that's like more than 800 right there (80:12 - 80:16)
but you don't get that apricorn thing (80:14 - 80:17)
and go (80:16 - 80:19)
like if i caught a weasel and a love (80:17 - 80:21)
ball and go i could move it to sword and (80:19 - 80:23)
shield (80:21 - 80:25)
but i can't like breed it in sort of (80:23 - 80:26)
[ __ ] here (80:25 - 80:28)
is the money-making opportunity and (80:26 - 80:30)
niantic if you do this i (80:28 - 80:33)
you have to write me a check (80:30 - 80:36)
you can change the pokeball you get (80:33 - 80:39)
pokeballs apricorn balls in pokemon go (80:36 - 80:40)
and then you can change (80:39 - 80:43)
the ball that a pokemon is right but (80:40 - 80:47)
only in pokemon go (80:43 - 80:52)
greg you want it i do want it (80:47 - 80:52)
okay wait what changing the pokeballs (80:53 - 81:00)
yeah so i caught the pokemon in an ultra (80:57 - 81:03)
ball but i want it to be in uh i don't (81:00 - 81:05)
know what's one of the apricorn balls (81:03 - 81:07)
love balls i love balls that's the (81:05 - 81:08)
easiest one then i just take it to the (81:07 - 81:11)
professor and i say (81:08 - 81:13)
professor swap this pokemon into a love (81:11 - 81:14)
ball and he says (81:13 - 81:16)
you've got five footballs that'll be (81:14 - 81:18)
4.99 (81:16 - 81:22)
yep yep niantic write me that check (81:18 - 81:26)
thank you i'm i i'm not rich but i do (81:22 - 81:28)
like money (81:26 - 81:32)
they could do raids where it's like (81:28 - 81:35)
valentine's day any instead of getting (81:32 - 81:37)
premier balls (81:35 - 81:39)
for your raid catching you get love (81:37 - 81:40)
balls (81:39 - 81:42)
they could do that yeah but again that's (81:40 - 81:44)
just like cosmetic (81:42 - 81:46)
but people care about cosmetics and (81:44 - 81:47)
pokemon go because i do because i don't (81:46 - 81:48)
want to (81:47 - 81:49)
catch my shinies in a great ball because (81:48 - 81:52)
they look bad and the pokeball are (81:49 - 81:54)
alterable (81:52 - 81:54)
no yeah no great balls are for throwing (81:54 - 81:58)
away yeah (81:57 - 82:02)
no use you keep the ultra balls for (81:58 - 82:05)
the things you're too lazy to catch you (82:02 - 82:06)
keep the pokeballs for the pokemon go (82:05 - 82:07)
plus (82:06 - 82:09)
that's it ultra balls are for hand (82:07 - 82:10)
catching (82:09 - 82:13)
pokeballs are for pokeball plus exactly (82:10 - 82:17)
great balls are for thrown away (82:13 - 82:17)
the question is the other question not (82:18 - 82:21)
mentioned here is do you think they ever (82:20 - 82:24)
introduced the master ball (82:21 - 82:28)
um but how would they do that (82:24 - 82:30)
and why would you use it pay ten dollars (82:28 - 82:31)
get a master ball (82:30 - 82:34)
because if you find like a shiny shiny (82:31 - 82:36)
if you find like a shiny (82:34 - 82:38)
hitmonchan i feel like golden razz ultra (82:36 - 82:40)
ball you're fine (82:38 - 82:42)
yet you'd be surprised that that one ran (82:40 - 82:43)
away from me (82:42 - 82:46)
[Laughter] (82:43 - 82:50)
yeah or (82:46 - 82:53)
uh you can use it um after a raid and (82:50 - 82:54)
just say (82:53 - 82:57)
i i want guaranteed catch of whatever (82:54 - 82:58)
this raid pokemon is (82:57 - 83:00)
but shiny in a raid is guaranteed well (82:58 - 83:02)
okay maybe i want the non-shiny (83:00 - 83:05)
that's true like i only want to do one (83:02 - 83:06)
landorus (83:05 - 83:07)
don't want to worry about catching it (83:06 - 83:09)
don't want to say they gave me 18 balls (83:07 - 83:10)
but how many can take too much time (83:09 - 83:14)
have i done that i didn't catch a kyogre (83:10 - 83:15)
mm-hmm (83:14 - 83:17)
because kyogre was too far back (83:15 - 83:20)
[Laughter] (83:17 - 83:20)
oh did we even end up going into the (83:32 - 83:35)
denny's or did we just have the denny's (83:34 - 83:38)
fiasco and never showed up (83:35 - 83:40)
oh we ended up going to the wrong (83:38 - 83:41)
denny's and went inside to the wrong (83:40 - 83:42)
tennis (83:41 - 83:44)
yeah but it was good i think the (83:42 - 83:45)
waitress called me hun (83:44 - 83:48)

post malone by the talking heads okay (84:24 - 84:27)

talking heads (84:30 - 84:35)
and then we talked about honeycombs (84:32 - 84:39)
and bees and there was some flying stuff (84:35 - 84:44)
in there and uh reference to salandit (84:39 - 84:47)
which is a pokemon um (84:44 - 84:51)
and also a reference for a red spot (84:47 - 84:53)
on the head (84:51 - 84:53)

shuffle because this is the entire (85:29 - 85:32)
pokemon (85:30 - 85:34)
i mean it's not a hard pokemon to just (85:32 - 85:36)
throw the whole thing up in there (85:34 - 85:40)
the shiny is decent reminds me of (85:36 - 85:42)
honeycomb cereal (85:40 - 85:44)
full of skittles which you know what i (85:42 - 85:46)
have to apologize (85:44 - 85:48)
that i threw honeycomb under the bust (85:46 - 85:49)
last week when i (85:48 - 85:52)
honestly meant golden grahams (85:49 - 85:54)
honeycomb is a good cereal golden (85:52 - 85:56)
grahams garbage (85:54 - 85:58)
okay so this is the thing i was at the (85:56 - 85:59)
grocery store today (85:58 - 86:02)
and i saw a golden graham's box and it (85:59 - 86:03)
said now (86:02 - 86:06)
honey is back (86:03 - 86:06)
where did it go that's the only selling (86:07 - 86:11)
point of golden grahams for years is the (86:09 - 86:12)
sweet taste of honey (86:11 - 86:15)
what did you do what did you put on (86:12 - 86:17)
golden grams and then you took it off (86:15 - 86:18)
and put a honey back honey (86:17 - 86:21)
why did honey leave so i went cause you (86:18 - 86:22)

stores in my neighborhood yes and they (86:22 - 86:25)
had (86:25 - 86:29)
a s'mores popcorn (86:25 - 86:32)

good there was no s'mores (86:41 - 86:45)
do we have trivia on combi dessert no (86:45 - 86:48)
that we don't have any that's why we (86:47 - 86:50)
were talking about s'mores because (86:48 - 86:52)
of boring pokemon no combi is a (86:50 - 86:55)
fantastic pokemon (86:52 - 86:58)
um all right this week's pokemon for (86:55 - 86:59)
your consideration we're going back to a (86:58 - 87:01)
more traditional style of the quiz (86:59 - 87:04)
but still please uh continue to listen (87:01 - 87:06)
to all of the words (87:04 - 87:09)
last line only matters since april 13th (87:06 - 87:12)
2021 we have been enjoying rivals week (87:09 - 87:14)
in pokemon go (87:12 - 87:16)
while some of the featured rivals are (87:14 - 87:17)
obvious xangoose (87:16 - 87:20)
viper are well known from hawaiian lore (87:17 - 87:23)
others don't come across as clearly (87:20 - 87:25)
this week's pokemon is actually being (87:23 - 87:28)
newly introduced to pokemon go (87:25 - 87:30)
as part of this event along with three (87:28 - 87:33)
others from the kalos region (87:30 - 87:35)
it can be obtained through wild (87:33 - 87:36)
encounters (87:35 - 87:39)
although i have heard this is quite rare (87:36 - 87:41)
in one star raids (87:39 - 87:44)
and as a reward for completing a win a (87:41 - 87:44)
raid (87:44 - 87:48)
research task of the four new halos (87:44 - 87:51)
pokemon introduced as part of this event (87:48 - 87:54)
three share one of their types but only (87:51 - 87:54)
two (87:54 - 87:57)
are monotype our pokemon this week is (87:54 - 87:59)
actually not a good swimmer but (87:57 - 88:01)
instead uses a jet like method for (87:59 - 88:03)
propulsion (88:01 - 88:05)
back in the days when mega evolution was (88:03 - 88:07)
the main competitive thing (88:05 - 88:10)
i ran a team that centered around mega (88:07 - 88:11)
blastoise (88:10 - 88:13)
it has an ability shared with this (88:11 - 88:14)
week's pokemon (88:13 - 88:17)
that boosts pulse moves by 50 percent of (88:14 - 88:19)
their power (88:17 - 88:22)
i was surprised to discover at that time (88:19 - 88:26)
that aurasphere is actually a pulse move (88:22 - 88:28)
this week's pokemon can learn four of (88:26 - 88:29)
the seven known (88:28 - 88:32)
pulse moves excluding dark pulse heel (88:29 - 88:33)
pulse (88:32 - 88:35)
and origin pulse another of the new (88:33 - 88:38)
pokemon introduced to go for rivals week (88:35 - 88:41)
can learn six of the seven which is even (88:38 - 88:41)
more (88:41 - 88:44)
than mega blastoise could learn (88:41 - 88:47)
that is enough information to figure out (88:44 - 88:48)
this week's pokemon (88:47 - 88:50)
