there to prevent that comment from (7:13 - 7:14)
coming (7:14 - 7:17)
i need to once again point out the (7:14 - 7:18)
banner year (7:17 - 7:22)
that was 2012 not an anniversary year (7:18 - 7:24)
that had more pokemon releases (7:22 - 7:27)
this year give me the releases 2012 (7:24 - 7:30)
2012 had black and white two okay (7:27 - 7:34)

uh conquest yes had (7:34 - 7:41)

there you go uh okay you name 2012. (8:08 - 8:12)
those are (8:11 - 8:14)
not a good year but also the reason that (8:12 - 8:16)
all of those came out in 2012 (8:14 - 8:18)
was because of the mayan calendar (8:16 - 8:20)
apocalypse so they (8:18 - 8:21)
needed to get all that content out (8:20 - 8:23)
before the world came to an end i forgot (8:21 - 8:26)
black two white two very good conquest (8:23 - 8:26)
very good (8:26 - 8:28)
the problem with those two games though (8:26 - 8:31)
is the 3ds already existed (8:28 - 8:34)
and that was like end of life cycle uh (8:31 - 8:37)
is the switch not been around for like (8:34 - 8:38)

got a vault this household is a dink (10:19 - 10:23)
household (10:22 - 10:27)
double income no kids yeah so (10:23 - 10:31)
like lastly i also had very bad habits (10:27 - 10:35)
with my credit cards earlier in my life (10:31 - 10:38)
see i did too and then i resorted in (10:35 - 10:40)
selling a lot of the stuff i collected (10:38 - 10:42)
because i wanted to get out of that (10:40 - 10:47)

must gather eos energy by defeating (14:57 - 15:02)
wild and opposing pokemon and then (15:00 - 15:03)
deposit the energy (15:02 - 15:06)
in the opposing team's goal zone (15:03 - 15:09)

learn more moves and evolve (16:14 - 16:17)
when a pokemon reaches higher levels it (16:15 - 16:19)
also learns a unite move (16:17 - 16:21)
a powerful move that can be learned and (16:19 - 16:22)
used in united (16:21 - 16:24)
battles unite moves can change the tide (16:22 - 16:25)

okay where do we want to start we want (19:24 - 19:27)
to start with (19:25 - 19:30)
just the thoughts on the trailer i mean (19:27 - 19:31)
the trailer is (19:30 - 19:32)
cool it was good it was a good trailer (19:31 - 19:34)
it's a good trailer (19:32 - 19:36)
it was very hype um i mean i want to (19:34 - 19:38)
play the game (19:36 - 19:42)
i would say that the i feel like (19:38 - 19:44)
as it's funny because when this podcast (19:42 - 19:46)
started 11 years ago (19:44 - 19:49)
we never really talked about (19:46 - 19:52)
anything of worth worth noting but we (19:49 - 19:53)
never really talked about like (19:52 - 19:57)
the how people felt about things (19:53 - 19:59)
and that's like a very i feel like (19:57 - 20:00)
that's a very common thing now in just (19:59 - 20:03)
social media of like what was the vibe (20:00 - 20:05)
after this happened well there barely (20:03 - 20:07)
was social media you didn't know what (20:05 - 20:08)
the vibe was (20:07 - 20:10)
i didn't care what the vibe was and last (20:08 - 20:11)
year when we were (20:10 - 20:13)
like the vibe for unite was very (20:11 - 20:14)
negative (20:13 - 20:17)
and it was mostly because of 10 cent um (20:14 - 20:20)
yeah and when this trailer came out (20:17 - 20:21)
i didn't really see anyone be like (20:20 - 20:23)
people seemed very excited i don't know (20:21 - 20:24)
if it just (20:23 - 20:26)
needed the time to breathe um or what (20:24 - 20:27)
they showed what (20:26 - 20:29)
was more exciting than what they talked (20:27 - 20:31)
about last year but (20:29 - 20:35)
uh i felt this last week people have (20:31 - 20:36)
been really excited for unite because of (20:35 - 20:38)
this trailer so i guess that's i mean (20:36 - 20:40)
that's good i mean i'm excited for you (20:38 - 20:40)
tonight so it's (20:40 - 20:42)
it's exciting to see other people (20:40 - 20:43)
excited for united i think they were i (20:42 - 20:44)
mean (20:43 - 20:45)
there were a lot of people who were (20:44 - 20:47)
excited for (20:45 - 20:50)
unite when it first came out last time (20:47 - 20:50)
too (20:50 - 20:54)
i think that uh what it what are we (20:50 - 20:56)
nine months later when we get the second (20:54 - 20:58)
trailer the people that were adamantly (20:56 - 20:59)
against it (20:58 - 21:02)
are just like whatever like i don't (20:59 - 21:04)
think (21:02 - 21:06)
well i think they're they've moved on to (21:04 - 21:08)
i hate chibis (21:06 - 21:09)
these are the worst remakes that have (21:08 - 21:11)
ever happened how could they do this to (21:09 - 21:13)
my trees (21:11 - 21:15)
these these time frames are too close (21:13 - 21:17)
like they've they've moved their (21:15 - 21:21)
ire onto other things and i don't think (21:17 - 21:24)
i don't think this game registers like (21:21 - 21:27)
they already wrote it off and so the (21:24 - 21:28)
people who are just like i like all (21:27 - 21:30)
things pokemon are here like yay this (21:28 - 21:31)
looks really cool (21:30 - 21:33)
and the people who are like i hate (21:31 - 21:34)
everything and i want to complain about (21:33 - 21:34)
it (21:34 - 21:37)
have moved on to the the the games they (21:34 - 21:40)
quote unquote see as main games or (21:37 - 21:42)
they care about (21:40 - 21:42)
but i think there's a lot of people who (21:43 - 21:46)
are very excited for it i'm excited for (21:44 - 21:48)
it yeah i i hope i like it (21:46 - 21:50)
as somebody you do too yeah i don't like (21:48 - 21:53)
you i played mobas yeah that's the thing (21:50 - 21:54)
is i never really played any (21:53 - 21:55)
like i've never played league i've never (21:54 - 21:57)
played dota i mean i've watched probably (21:55 - 21:58)
like an hour (21:57 - 22:00)
of league in the last like five years (21:58 - 22:01)
you know ten minutes here (22:00 - 22:03)
five minutes i don't remember which one (22:01 - 22:06)
it was um (22:03 - 22:06)
i mean they look very similar the main (22:07 - 22:10)
difference (22:08 - 22:13)
is so i (22:10 - 22:14)
do we need to get into the technical (22:13 - 22:16)
details of the difference between (22:14 - 22:19)
league and dota no i don't i don't i (22:16 - 22:20)
don't think so i mean what it comes down (22:19 - 22:22)
to is character selection but (22:20 - 22:27)
yeah so i think the trailer was good um (22:22 - 22:30)
they did the closed beta last month in (22:27 - 22:30)
canada (22:30 - 22:33)
which i think we said on the show and i (22:30 - 22:35)
think everyone kind of expected that (22:33 - 22:36)
like (22:35 - 22:38)
oh if they're doing an english-speaking (22:36 - 22:41)
country they must be close to done um (22:38 - 22:42)
yeah either australia or canada they (22:41 - 22:46)
always get the good stuff first (22:42 - 22:46)
and the interesting thing is i saw some (22:46 - 22:51)
people be like wow it's coming to switch (22:49 - 22:51)
first (22:51 - 22:54)
not mobile i think this makes sense i (22:51 - 22:55)
don't know why this is a shocker there (22:54 - 22:57)
are more mobile devices out there than (22:55 - 22:58)
switch (22:57 - 22:59)
so if you want to make sure your server (22:58 - 23:01)
is not overloaded you pick (22:59 - 23:06)
the platform that is smaller um (23:01 - 23:09)
although i feel like if i loved this (23:06 - 23:10)
game (23:09 - 23:11)
i don't know if that's gonna be true or (23:10 - 23:13)
not i would assume (23:11 - 23:17)
that like an ipad or whatever (23:13 - 23:22)
android people use whatever that is (23:17 - 23:26)
more powerful than a switch (23:22 - 23:28)
so if i really love this game i feel (23:26 - 23:29)
like i would get (23:28 - 23:31)
i would use my ipad and then just sync a (23:29 - 23:34)
playstation 4 controller to it (23:31 - 23:35)
and play it that way what do you need (23:34 - 23:37)
the power for (23:35 - 23:39)
because the graphics in this game aren't (23:37 - 23:41)
so great probably just like (23:39 - 23:45)
like frame rate stuff yeah or like lag (23:41 - 23:47)
which i which i don't know how much that (23:45 - 23:48)
matters in a mobile because i've never (23:47 - 23:50)
played it right like when i'm playing (23:48 - 23:50)
like (23:50 - 23:53)
it matters ping matters yes right like (23:50 - 23:56)
definitely matters but (23:53 - 24:00)
what kind of confuses me is like one of (23:56 - 24:00)
the core (24:00 - 24:05)
things of moba play is my right hand (24:00 - 24:06)
i guess maybe left hand if you're (24:05 - 24:09)
left-handed is on the mouse (24:06 - 24:14)
and my other hand is on q-w-e-r (24:09 - 24:16)
right oh okay so you've got what's three (24:14 - 24:19)
attacks (24:16 - 24:19)
um like how (24:21 - 24:27)
how's that do they replicate that on a (24:24 - 24:29)
controller you just joystick to move and (24:27 - 24:29)
then a (24:29 - 24:32)
x b y yeah it's not the same (24:29 - 24:35)
[Laughter] (24:32 - 24:38)
the same are you in in dota and league (24:35 - 24:41)
are you clicking to move like in diablo (24:38 - 24:43)
you you click to where you want to go (24:41 - 24:45)
and your dude just like walks towards (24:43 - 24:46)
the last place (24:45 - 24:49)
because i think diablo 3 (24:46 - 24:52)
on ps4 or (24:49 - 24:54)
switch because it came out on everything (24:52 - 24:55)
i thought because they don't have the (24:54 - 24:57)
click to move anymore they just have the (24:55 - 24:58)
stick (24:57 - 24:59)
and i thought they when they did that (24:58 - 25:02)
change because i played diablo 3 and (24:59 - 25:05)
mac and then when it came to ps4 irene (25:02 - 25:06)
and i got it because we liked playing (25:05 - 25:07)
together and (25:06 - 25:10)
that that change wasn't jarring to me (25:07 - 25:11)
like they (25:10 - 25:14)
blizzard figured it out i i don't know (25:11 - 25:17)
people are very particular about what (25:14 - 25:19)
they use to control their games but yes (25:17 - 25:20)
if you if you ever want (25:19 - 25:23)
like the if if you asmr for clicking (25:20 - 25:24)
noises (25:23 - 25:26)
sit in a room with somebody who's (25:24 - 25:28)
playing either league or dota because (25:26 - 25:28)
like (25:28 - 25:30)
like two of my closest friends one's a (25:28 - 25:32)
league player one's a dota player and (25:30 - 25:33)
it's literally just like click click (25:32 - 25:35)
click click click click click (25:33 - 25:36)
cause they're just constantly clicking (25:35 - 25:39)
around yeah um and i think (25:36 - 25:42)
now folks don't come at me because it's (25:39 - 25:42)
been a very (25:42 - 25:44)
long time since i played league it's (25:42 - 25:45)
like (25:44 - 25:48)
left click is where your character walks (25:45 - 25:49)
towards (25:48 - 25:52)
right click is how you aim your attack (25:49 - 25:55)
but even on so it's coming to like (25:52 - 25:58)
mobile which is iphone android phone (25:55 - 26:01)
tablet ipad (25:58 - 26:01)
is a touch screen experience what you (26:02 - 26:06)
want i guess maybe like an android phone (26:04 - 26:10)
you could probably hook up a mouse right (26:06 - 26:12)
but but you why are you assuming that (26:10 - 26:14)
the switch version isn't going to be (26:12 - 26:15)
touch screen (26:14 - 26:19)
the switch is a touch screen oh i don't (26:15 - 26:19)
think for (26:19 - 26:21)
at all it's going to be touching i mean (26:19 - 26:22)
it would (26:21 - 26:24)
would it not if it's touch screen that (26:22 - 26:27)
would it not project on the tv (26:24 - 26:30)
did they say that it maybe it doesn't (26:27 - 26:31)
maybe it's a hammer (26:30 - 26:33)
i don't know if in the press release it (26:31 - 26:34)
says what (26:33 - 26:36)
like that would be weird as one of the (26:34 - 26:38)
selling points of the switch that (26:36 - 26:41)
it wouldn't i mean it's not (26:38 - 26:43)
out of the question i'll double check (26:41 - 26:45)
the website but technically cafe mix is (26:43 - 26:48)
you touch screen like i don't think you (26:45 - 26:50)
play cafe mix on the switch with (26:48 - 26:54)
controllers a pro controller (26:50 - 26:54)
i don't know if it says on the website (26:57 - 27:02)
the controllers that you can use (26:59 - 27:02)
although we shouldn't overly compare it (27:03 - 27:06)
to league and (27:05 - 27:09)
dota just because yes it's a moba but (27:06 - 27:10)
there (27:09 - 27:12)
i think there are even in what we've (27:10 - 27:14)
been shown (27:12 - 27:17)
significant differences right because (27:14 - 27:19)
you're not attacking towers (27:17 - 27:22)
your goal is not to do them (27:19 - 27:26)
like destroy the enemy's goal zone it's (27:22 - 27:27)
more like (27:26 - 27:30)
soccer and it's like scoring points (27:27 - 27:31)
i don't know if we can ever get away (27:30 - 27:33)
from that though i mean like you make a (27:31 - 27:33)
mo (27:33 - 27:35)
like any moba's gonna get compared to (27:33 - 27:36)
dota and league and yeah (27:35 - 27:38)
battle royale is gonna get compared to (27:36 - 27:39)
apex or fortnite (27:38 - 27:41)
but and yeah but we also we didn't see (27:39 - 27:44)
enough like right so much about dota and (27:41 - 27:45)
league is like (27:44 - 27:49)
top lane mid lane bottom lane jungle (27:45 - 27:51)
and i don't know from what i've read it (27:49 - 27:52)
almost seems like the whole thing is (27:51 - 27:54)
just jungle (27:52 - 27:58)
[Laughter] (27:54 - 27:58)
i don't know who are the creeps who are (27:59 - 28:03)
the minions what are we farming here (28:00 - 28:07)
we we have we have roster (28:03 - 28:09)
i'll just run through the roster i i (28:07 - 28:10)
don't think everyone will be available (28:09 - 28:12)
at the start but this is the (28:10 - 28:13)
of all the ones that have been (28:12 - 28:15)
officially announced pikachu (28:13 - 28:19)
charizard snorlax crustal (28:15 - 28:22)
greninja eldagas talonflame (28:19 - 28:26)
lucario venusaur mr mime (28:22 - 28:29)
slobro apsil machamp (28:26 - 28:33)
wigglytuff alolan ninetales cramerant (28:29 - 28:37)
gengar garchomp and cinderese (28:33 - 28:40)
and thank you what's not on here but (28:37 - 28:41)
they did (28:40 - 28:43)
officially announce is blastoise and (28:41 - 28:45)
gardevoir and a third character (28:43 - 28:49)
are eventually coming um (28:45 - 28:51)
but i can't remember how they worded (28:49 - 28:53)
this like some of these characters will (28:51 - 28:54)
be free (28:53 - 28:57)
and then you have to pay your you when (28:54 - 28:58)
you earn your gosh (28:57 - 29:00)
gems is paid when you earn your like (28:58 - 29:02)
tickets you can use your tickets or your (29:00 - 29:04)
coins to unlock these characters (29:02 - 29:05)
or you can just pay for them outright to (29:04 - 29:08)
unlock them which is a very apex legends (29:05 - 29:10)
thing (29:08 - 29:12)
yeah yeah but i think that's more league (29:10 - 29:14)
than dota (29:12 - 29:16)
but in in apex legends you had like (29:14 - 29:17)
eight characters and then mirage and (29:16 - 29:18)
caustic where the (29:17 - 29:22)
the um you must unlock with currency (29:18 - 29:23)
and you could either play apex for like (29:22 - 29:25)
20 some hours to unlock them for free or (29:23 - 29:27)
you could just buy them up front i think (29:25 - 29:28)
they were nine bucks (29:27 - 29:29)
um and now at this point because you (29:28 - 29:31)
play so much apex when they release a (29:29 - 29:32)
new character you probably have enough (29:31 - 29:34)
of that currency (29:32 - 29:36)
just to unlock them for free i would (29:34 - 29:37)
assume that's going to be the same in (29:36 - 29:39)
unite they add characters but if you've (29:37 - 29:40)
been playing since day one (29:39 - 29:41)
when that character drops you probably (29:40 - 29:44)
have enough of the free currency to (29:41 - 29:46)
unlock it without spending money i have (29:44 - 29:49)
a fundamental question (29:46 - 29:53)
are you on the pokemon unite webpage (29:49 - 29:55)
unite.pokemon.com yeah i'm here are you (29:53 - 29:57)
on the overview page (29:55 - 30:00)
i am on the pokemon page go to the (29:57 - 30:01)
overview page (30:00 - 30:05)
yes i'm here scroll down to rewards (30:01 - 30:05)
uh i see it that dude's got a sable (30:07 - 30:14)
light and i want sableye (30:10 - 30:14)
is a helper (30:14 - 30:17)
there's other pokemon in the game that (30:17 - 30:21)
aren't gameplay pokemon (30:19 - 30:24)
oh that's because he's that seller he's (30:21 - 30:25)
in charge of (30:24 - 30:27)
zerko trading he's the he's the seller (30:25 - 30:29)
he's the clothes seller (30:27 - 30:31)
doesn't matter i want that same lie it's (30:29 - 30:32)
in the game (30:31 - 30:35)
give it to me uh hero style (30:32 - 30:39)
beach style and magician style (30:35 - 30:42)
i want that sable it's so cute i'm so (30:39 - 30:43)
mad (30:42 - 30:46)
uh all right who's your main will (30:43 - 30:48)
because we know who steve's meaning (30:46 - 30:51)
how is this even a question what (30:48 - 30:54)
the oh is obviously a crustal fan he's (30:51 - 30:58)
obviously a lucario guy i'm not support (30:54 - 31:00)
i am a support player well then you (30:58 - 31:02)
ain't playing the cram (31:00 - 31:03)
no that's probably true yeah even though (31:02 - 31:05)
i like the cram i'm i'm usually a (31:03 - 31:06)
support player in (31:05 - 31:10)
in games normally like i play crypto in (31:06 - 31:11)
apex (31:10 - 31:14)
even though so let me will who who (31:11 - 31:16)
have they already been calling to get (31:14 - 31:18)
nerfed because it's op (31:16 - 31:20)
in a game that you can't even play yet (31:18 - 31:21)
charizard (31:20 - 31:25)
no ninja no (31:21 - 31:25)
cinders cinderache no (31:26 - 31:31)
we once again have killed greg greg (31:31 - 31:35)
knows the answer (31:33 - 31:38)
i've been saying this for a year now (31:35 - 31:41)
which pokemon is op in pokemon steve (31:38 - 31:42)
because it's (31:41 - 31:48)
killing me mr mime mr mime (31:42 - 31:48)
i'm trying to think i'm looking i've (31:52 - 31:56)
literally said this since (31:54 - 31:59)
day one can you not remember flame (31:56 - 32:02)
talent (31:59 - 32:02)
you know i i i'm looking at the list (32:06 - 32:10)
here (32:09 - 32:13)
and i am normally a support player and i (32:10 - 32:15)
i will say that slowbro is really (32:13 - 32:17)
standing out to me (32:15 - 32:19)
slowbro got that four out of five stars (32:17 - 32:20)
in support i don't think there's a (32:19 - 32:21)
single pokemon with five stars in (32:20 - 32:22)
support (32:21 - 32:25)
uh except slowpro's not in support (32:22 - 32:29)
slope bro is a defender i feel like a (32:25 - 32:30)
defender is a support role (32:29 - 32:32)
well unfortunately the ones that are (32:30 - 32:34)
literally called support are el degas mr (32:32 - 32:37)
mime and wigglytuff (32:34 - 32:37)
so slow bro is not a healer slow bro has (32:38 - 32:42)
a four (32:41 - 32:44)
i i didn't say specifically healing i (32:42 - 32:45)
said specifically support silver has a (32:44 - 32:46)
four out of five (32:45 - 32:49)
i believe what they mean by defender is (32:46 - 32:50)
i don't know what a defender is in uh (32:49 - 32:53)
in uh moba i think it's tank (32:50 - 32:55)
sucks sucks up damage doesn't do a lot (32:53 - 32:57)
of damage sucks so you mean like the (32:55 - 32:59)
the the guy with the giant shield in (32:57 - 33:01)
overwatch that dude yeah (32:59 - 33:04)
right reinhardt don't ever mention (33:01 - 33:05)
overwatch ever again (33:04 - 33:07)
please yeah i played overwatch for at (33:05 - 33:09)
least a (33:07 - 33:13)
for at weekend five minutes (33:09 - 33:13)
somebody did the calculation of how much (33:13 - 33:17)
those five minutes (33:15 - 33:20)
each minute cost five thousand dollars (33:17 - 33:22)
now because of the life you lost playing (33:20 - 33:22)
it (33:22 - 33:25)
so steve is either cramer ant or slow (33:22 - 33:25)
bro (33:25 - 33:27)
uh i'm not opposed to elder goss or (33:25 - 33:29)
wigglytuff though they said quote (33:27 - 33:32)
you back off i have already claimed my (33:29 - 33:33)
space (33:32 - 33:37)
i've never blamed two one is aldegast (33:33 - 33:39)
and do you know what the other is (33:37 - 33:42)
all the nine tails yes i have claimed (33:39 - 33:42)
them as (33:42 - 33:45)
my space so get out of it until (33:42 - 33:47)
gardevoir shows up and then i make (33:45 - 33:48)
things (33:47 - 33:51)
my space got shut down like 10 years ago (33:48 - 33:52)
it's back my space is back (33:51 - 33:56)
oh but (33:52 - 33:56)
i said how many elder goss plushes you (33:56 - 34:00)
got cause i got at least one (33:58 - 34:04)
uh i'm not a fool with my money i buy (34:00 - 34:06)
dx's and keep them so i can play the (34:04 - 34:08)
games that i like instead of wasting it (34:06 - 34:08)
on plushes (34:08 - 34:10)
that will sit in the background for (34:08 - 34:13)
people to stare at goodness (34:10 - 34:15)
this game looks awesome i mean it looks (34:13 - 34:17)
fun i hope it's fun (34:15 - 34:19)
i mean i i okay there's three of us now (34:17 - 34:20)
we need two more (34:19 - 34:22)
yeah you think bobby and al are good (34:20 - 34:23)
enough or we gotta we gotta what about (34:22 - 34:24)
britney (34:23 - 34:25)
you think brittany probably carries (34:24 - 34:27)
right bev (34:25 - 34:31)
uh bev would would do a couple rounds (34:27 - 34:33)
i took bobby i mean here's the thing (34:31 - 34:36)
bobby we know we'll buy everything (34:33 - 34:38)
so yeah but i feel like bobby would get (34:36 - 34:42)
distracted with like checking pokemon (34:38 - 34:43)
it's like thank god bobby's an (34:42 - 34:45)
accountant because that dude (34:43 - 34:48)
gets pulled into every financial scam (34:45 - 34:49)
that exists (34:48 - 34:51)
also bobby has no patience so he'll have (34:49 - 34:52)
all the characters unlocked (34:51 - 34:54)
right away yeah true yeah that doesn't (34:52 - 34:56)
mean for us (34:54 - 34:58)
wait stephen was a big league of legends (34:56 - 34:59)
player wasn't he (34:58 - 35:03)
oh steve does yeah league absolutely (34:59 - 35:06)
count count on him for sure in the game (35:03 - 35:08)
which which one does he get (35:06 - 35:11)
venusaur done sold (35:08 - 35:15)
oh nick will only provide commentary (35:11 - 35:16)
yeah play video games (35:15 - 35:18)
i think nick would be a very good coach (35:16 - 35:20)
yeah could well (35:18 - 35:21)
that would require nick to know what (35:20 - 35:23)
he's doing no i think it's better when (35:21 - 35:25)
he doesn't know what he's doing okay (35:23 - 35:26)
yeah i think it's that kind of a (35:25 - 35:28)
situation what about maddie (35:26 - 35:32)
or vince ah (35:28 - 35:34)
the problem is maddie and vince are such (35:32 - 35:36)
gentle souls (35:34 - 35:38)
and this game is all about violence (35:36 - 35:42)
you've you've played magic with this (35:38 - 35:44)
there's nothing gentle about what i (35:42 - 35:45)
would say and vince are both rage (35:44 - 35:47)
quitters (35:45 - 35:49)
we can't have that on the team maddie's (35:47 - 35:51)
a rage quitter i've known her for 10 (35:49 - 35:52)
plus years (35:51 - 35:54)
okay that'll give you i don't know that (35:52 - 35:56)
i don't know that vince is a rage (35:54 - 35:57)
quitter (35:56 - 35:59)
all right so the three of us stephen for (35:57 - 36:00)
sure (35:59 - 36:02)
uh we'll see how everything plays with (36:00 - 36:04)
bobby and the bobby will get distracted (36:02 - 36:06)
with a raid and have to go (36:04 - 36:08)
do poke also bobby has kids we can't we (36:06 - 36:09)
can't have players (36:08 - 36:11)
this is this is a competitive team this (36:09 - 36:13)
is this is this is you've got (36:11 - 36:16)
a child you've you've disqualified (36:13 - 36:17)
yourself from competitive (36:16 - 36:19)
yep because we are gonna have to do the (36:17 - 36:21)
circuit we will have to travel the world (36:19 - 36:22)
for the pokemon unite circuit (36:21 - 36:25)
we will get matching uniforms get on (36:22 - 36:28)
that deal with your athletic wear (36:25 - 36:31)

sharing them profits we get our own (36:39 - 36:42)

gonna inform our flavor (36:47 - 36:50)
yeah yeah like and the (36:48 - 36:52)
[Music] (36:50 - 36:55)
slush rush what (36:52 - 36:57)
because slush rush is an ability but it (36:55 - 36:59)
also sounds like a flavor of g (36:57 - 37:02)
fuel but it also is fun to say and it (36:59 - 37:04)
sounds like a sick team (37:02 - 37:07)
the pk men cast slush (37:04 - 37:09)
we're cutting off rush we're cutting out (37:07 - 37:11)
the first part we're just doing slush (37:09 - 37:12)
rush (37:11 - 37:14)
rush we are not giving in to your unique (37:12 - 37:16)
branding we are not here to build up (37:14 - 37:16)
steve (37:16 - 37:18)
we are here to build up the team this is (37:16 - 37:20)
why steve is never a good team he's not (37:18 - 37:21)
a team player (37:20 - 37:23)
not (37:21 - 37:23)
he'll be like i'm slow growing over here (37:24 - 37:27)
look at me and we're out there (37:26 - 37:30)
working hard to get the points to get (37:27 - 37:32)
the wins and (37:30 - 37:35)
we get the wins he takes the glory hmm i (37:32 - 37:38)
yeah i'm pretty bad at video games it's (37:35 - 37:39)
like this podcast (37:38 - 37:44)
we do the work he gets the wins (37:39 - 37:44)
it's why i'm crypto in apex because i i (37:45 - 37:50)
hang back when both teammates die (37:48 - 37:52)
i revive them with my drone and then i'm (37:50 - 37:53)
like (37:52 - 37:54)
well do it again because i'm not good (37:53 - 37:57)
enough the main thing to worry about in (37:54 - 37:58)
team building (37:57 - 38:00)
is you've got to also figure out who's (37:58 - 38:01)
going to be the backup when i get tired (38:00 - 38:02)
of all of you (38:01 - 38:05)
and leave and somebody's gonna have to (38:02 - 38:06)

your mess you were yes oh i was such a (40:59 - 41:07)
gengar man uh this game will have a (41:03 - 41:08)
battle pass (41:07 - 41:10)
uh i don't know if you guys play (41:08 - 41:12)
specifically any games that have a (41:10 - 41:13)
battle pass yourself (41:12 - 41:16)
i mean i have a monthly subscription to (41:13 - 41:17)
final fantasy (41:16 - 41:21)
yeah yep that i pay six months at a time (41:17 - 41:22)
so it's pretty cheap (41:21 - 41:24)
um so (41:22 - 41:24)
i'm just i i wanna i wanna go over the (41:25 - 41:29)
battle passage because (41:27 - 41:31)
this is new to pokemon and i'm sure (41:29 - 41:32)
there are lots of listeners (41:31 - 41:34)
there are probably a handful of (41:32 - 41:36)
listeners that play dota or league or (41:34 - 41:38)
overwatch or whatever there's probably a (41:36 - 41:39)
handful of listeners that listen to the (41:38 - 41:42)
show that haven't done in this at all (41:39 - 41:46)
um so usually a battle pass is (41:42 - 41:49)
a set amount of time uh could be 60 days (41:46 - 41:51)
could be 90 days (41:49 - 41:54)
you pay normally like 10 bucks (41:51 - 41:55)
and then when you level up that battle (41:54 - 41:57)
pass normally uh (41:55 - 41:59)
there could be 30 levels 60 levels 100 (41:57 - 42:00)
levels every time you level it up (41:59 - 42:04)
you earn rewards and there's usually (42:00 - 42:06)
i don't know if this game is going to do (42:04 - 42:08)
it there's usually a free (42:06 - 42:09)
battle pass and then there's a paid (42:08 - 42:11)
battle pass oh greg we played clash (42:09 - 42:12)
royale they had (42:11 - 42:14)
they had the free and paid battle pass (42:12 - 42:15)
their battle pass was five bucks though (42:14 - 42:18)
yeah and their battle pass was you (42:15 - 42:21)
suckered me into that twice and i oh (42:18 - 42:22)
never (42:21 - 42:25)
okay clash royale did such a good job at (42:22 - 42:27)
convincing you to get the battle pass (42:25 - 42:28)
because it would then (42:27 - 42:31)
show so you're right in your clan or (42:28 - 42:32)
your friends list (42:31 - 42:34)
bought the battle pass so when the (42:32 - 42:36)
battle pass came out and you would log (42:34 - 42:37)
into like (42:36 - 42:39)
clash royale had like this like chat (42:37 - 42:40)
built in you would see (42:39 - 42:42)
everyone purchase the battle pass and (42:40 - 42:44)
then you would be like (42:42 - 42:47)
oh i don't like everyone has it but me (42:44 - 42:51)
like it was like this social pressure (42:47 - 42:54)
it was it was very good it was very bad (42:51 - 43:00)
and i got i i got snookered into it (42:54 - 43:02)
and then um so the battle pass usually (43:00 - 43:03)
rewards you with (43:02 - 43:06)
uh well at least so i wanna apex's (43:03 - 43:07)
battle pass is (43:06 - 43:10)
i think it's like 10 bucks you get to (43:07 - 43:11)
110 (43:10 - 43:13)
is their max level you have 90 days to (43:11 - 43:15)
do it and they say (43:13 - 43:17)
that if you can max it out you actually (43:15 - 43:19)
get your 10 back (43:17 - 43:21)
because you get it back in coins (43:19 - 43:23)
[Music] (43:21 - 43:25)
and they have like skins and they have (43:23 - 43:27)
emotes and they have (43:25 - 43:29)
it's mostly skins they have like weapon (43:27 - 43:30)
charms (43:29 - 43:32)
and then they have like the little loot (43:30 - 43:34)
boxes i don't know if they they didn't (43:32 - 43:35)
say in this press release if this game (43:34 - 43:37)
has loot boxes (43:35 - 43:39)
at all which is like a thing in (43:37 - 43:41)
overwatch you know you level up you get (43:39 - 43:42)
a loot box (43:41 - 43:45)
um so they haven't said that (43:42 - 43:45)
but uh i'm curious if this game will (43:47 - 43:53)
have it where (43:50 - 43:55)
there is a free battle pass and if like (43:53 - 43:57)
halfway through the season you decide oh (43:55 - 43:59)
i want to get the battle pass now (43:57 - 43:59)
because i (43:59 - 44:01)
i didn't get to play the first like (43:59 - 44:03)
three weeks but now i'm playing a lot (44:01 - 44:05)
if it remembers that like oh you earned (44:03 - 44:08)
this amount so this is what apex does (44:05 - 44:09)
if you got to like level 50 on the free (44:08 - 44:11)
battle pass and you decide (44:09 - 44:12)
okay i'm gonna pay for the battle pass (44:11 - 44:14)
now it will give you all the retro (44:12 - 44:16)
rewards (44:14 - 44:17)
and then start you at like whatever (44:16 - 44:19)
level you were (44:17 - 44:20)
um and then the other thing is like (44:19 - 44:22)
let's say you're getting i've only done (44:20 - 44:23)
this once (44:22 - 44:25)
if it's like the last day of the season (44:23 - 44:28)
and you're like level 98 (44:25 - 44:30)
and you're like i really want the level (44:28 - 44:31)
100 reward (44:30 - 44:35)
they let you pay money to skip levels (44:31 - 44:38)
so like i was 98 one season and (44:35 - 44:42)
the the season ended in like 12 hours (44:38 - 44:44)
and it was like 4 00 a.m (44:42 - 44:46)
or something and i was like i could keep (44:44 - 44:47)
playing (44:46 - 44:48)
or i could just give them six bucks and (44:47 - 44:51)
i'm gonna go to bed (44:48 - 44:53)
because i wanted the level 100 rewarding (44:51 - 44:54)
that's how they get you (44:53 - 44:56)
yeah that's what they're gonna get there (44:54 - 44:57)
in the morning making poor choices with (44:56 - 44:58)
their life (44:57 - 45:00)
yeah oh i mean that's how i spend 30 on (44:58 - 45:03)
garden escape so i (45:00 - 45:06)
just go can't judge i'm i'm really (45:03 - 45:07)
though like (45:06 - 45:10)
overall i've never been like against (45:07 - 45:11)
battle passes there are (45:10 - 45:12)
definitely some battle passes where i (45:11 - 45:15)
felt like they were pretty lackluster (45:12 - 45:19)
um but i think we're on we're on season (45:15 - 45:21)
eight of apex and i think i've bought (45:19 - 45:22)
seven of the eight battle passes and i (45:21 - 45:24)
think i finished (45:22 - 45:28)
three of them but i never felt like (45:24 - 45:29)
even if i did finish it i never felt (45:28 - 45:32)
like i was like super ripped off (45:29 - 45:33)
i didn't feel like i was ripped off i (45:32 - 45:35)
mean i was gonna play the game anyways (45:33 - 45:37)
so giving 10 bucks every three months (45:35 - 45:38)
for a game i (45:37 - 45:42)
like i never felt like oh they're really (45:38 - 45:45)
pulling a fast one over on me oh clash (45:42 - 45:48)
royale (45:45 - 45:49)
maybe i didn't feel satisfied with that (45:48 - 45:52)
five dollars (45:49 - 45:52)
i did the very first time and the second (45:52 - 45:56)
time i was really regretting it and then (45:54 - 45:59)
we just left the game all together and (45:56 - 46:01)
never came back like how i do drop the (45:59 - 46:02)
bomb and leave (46:01 - 46:04)
yep i would say though if pokemon go had (46:02 - 46:06)
a battle pass i would be i would do it (46:04 - 46:09)
uh a hundred percent i mean you do play (46:06 - 46:11)
a lot of pokemon go i love pokemon go (46:09 - 46:13)
the game has proven itself to you it (46:11 - 46:15)
depends on what i'm getting (46:13 - 46:18)
for the money that i'm spending (46:15 - 46:20)
and if honestly if i can get the same (46:18 - 46:22)
thing for free by putting time in (46:20 - 46:24)
and if i really like the game i'm gonna (46:22 - 46:26)
put the time in (46:24 - 46:28)
do you not feel like the dollar research (46:26 - 46:29)
for communities are worth it though (46:28 - 46:33)
no oh they're fun except (46:29 - 46:34)
i finished them in about five minutes (46:33 - 46:36)
and then it's like (46:34 - 46:38)
once in a while i do them if i really (46:36 - 46:40)
like like i did the rosalia one (46:38 - 46:43)
sure the one aft i did well i got two we (46:40 - 46:44)
got for free (46:43 - 46:46)
because we bought the pass and then the (46:44 - 46:47)
yeah i (46:46 - 46:49)
didn't do the others and i did the (46:47 - 46:52)
garchomp one (46:49 - 46:52)
but i don't think they don't really do (46:53 - 46:57)
it like i it's like the rewards are to (46:54 - 46:58)
get more garchomp (46:57 - 47:00)
which are spawning everywhere a little (46:58 - 47:02)
story (47:00 - 47:04)
yeah you get the story you don't like (47:02 - 47:07)
the little like gibble bit (47:04 - 47:09)
i don't know what this pokemon is please (47:07 - 47:11)
find it oh it's a kibble (47:09 - 47:13)
what does it do it looks like gibble (47:11 - 47:15)
bites did you know gibbles can evolve (47:13 - 47:18)
what do they evolve into look it is a (47:15 - 47:19)
garchomp (47:18 - 47:21)
does this garchomp bite oh it bit me (47:19 - 47:23)
good job (47:21 - 47:28)
that sounds like it's worth 99.99 (47:23 - 47:31)
do you both see yourself buying (47:28 - 47:34)
let's say let's say you you you like (47:31 - 47:37)
unite you like it maybe more than (47:34 - 47:39)
pokemon go for greg because greg is (47:37 - 47:41)
always down on pokemon go (47:39 - 47:42)
i am not done yeah but he'll play (47:41 - 47:45)
pokemon masters that shows you his value (47:42 - 47:46)
system (47:45 - 47:49)
i barely play [ __ ] up my masters (47:46 - 47:51)
let's say out of all the mobile games (47:49 - 47:52)
masters magikarp (47:51 - 47:56)
jump cafe mix pokemon go (47:52 - 47:59)
you like this the most shuffle well you (47:56 - 48:00)
know shuffle is (47:59 - 48:04)
incredible would you see yourself buying (48:00 - 48:07)
cosmetics or buying characters or would (48:04 - 48:08)
you (48:07 - 48:10)
be like no cosmetics i'm not paying real (48:08 - 48:11)
money (48:10 - 48:12)
i'm gonna grind out these characters (48:11 - 48:14)
what's the thought process here (48:12 - 48:17)
so i really like let's let's take this (48:14 - 48:19)
to a real world example of that's (48:17 - 48:20)
happening now i really like final (48:19 - 48:21)
fantasy 14 (48:20 - 48:24)
and i refuse to buy cosmetics in that (48:21 - 48:24)
game (48:24 - 48:26)
you almost got divorced because of final (48:24 - 48:28)
fantasy 14. (48:26 - 48:31)
so yeah that's a real investment i mean (48:28 - 48:32)

out then i'm grinding it out (53:15 - 53:18)
there's no way characters aren't paywall (53:16 - 53:20)
only like the the (53:18 - 53:23)
i can see the cosmetics (53:20 - 53:26)
like hey if you want uh surf dad (53:23 - 53:26)
garchomp (53:26 - 53:31)
you gotta pony up ten bucks but (53:26 - 53:34)
it has to be like other mobas slash (53:31 - 53:35)
games where the character i think they (53:34 - 53:36)
even said i think (53:35 - 53:37)
like you can i think they said (53:36 - 53:39)
characters was paid currency and (53:37 - 53:42)
coins or whatever the other 70 (53:39 - 53:44)
currencies in this game are (53:42 - 53:46)
will would you will you pony up money (53:44 - 53:47)
heck no (53:46 - 53:50)
what for a moba yeah much money you're (53:47 - 53:52)
in garden escapes over here you wouldn't (53:50 - 53:53)
spend (53:52 - 53:55)
five dollars on a t-shirt for your (53:53 - 53:56)
gengar no no (53:55 - 53:59)
i don't do skins i don't know not ever (53:56 - 54:00)
since (53:59 - 54:03)
that day in 2013 (54:00 - 54:07)
when i had a skin for my favorite league (54:03 - 54:11)
character and some other player text (54:07 - 54:13)
messaged me and said why do you have a (54:11 - 54:15)
skin for a character you obviously don't (54:13 - 54:16)
know how to play (54:15 - 54:20)
never again no more skins done (54:16 - 54:22)
steve did you not learn your lesson from (54:20 - 54:23)
destiny one (54:22 - 54:26)
who is your favorite league character (54:23 - 54:27)
i don't know any league character so i (54:26 - 54:29)
guess that doesn't matter yeah i mean (54:27 - 54:32)
how is that gonna help you (54:29 - 54:34)
uh did i learn my lesson from destiny (54:32 - 54:36)
one uh no no i did not (54:34 - 54:40)
i i still i still regret (54:36 - 54:42)
a lot of what happened to destiny 1 in (54:40 - 54:45)
my three years with that game (54:42 - 54:47)
i i spent a fair amount of money in (54:45 - 54:48)
final fantasy though i mean like i've (54:47 - 54:50)
been i've been subbed on and off for (54:48 - 54:52)
three years i bought the like (54:50 - 54:54)
two-person balloon mount thing that was (54:52 - 54:56)
like 20 bucks now i got that on sale (54:54 - 54:58)
that was like 15. (54:56 - 55:01)
um nope i won't do it (54:58 - 55:03)
and for our league playing listeners it (55:01 - 55:04)
was uh sona (55:03 - 55:09)
i learned my lesson in world of warcraft (55:04 - 55:09)
i did spend real money for cosmetic (55:10 - 55:14)
things and then i realized this is the (55:12 - 55:17)
dumbest thing i've spent money on yes (55:14 - 55:19)
yes i'm i don't know i don't necessarily (55:17 - 55:21)
have a problem with (55:19 - 55:23)
buying cosmetics especially if the game (55:21 - 55:25)
is like free (55:23 - 55:27)
uh like pokemon go has never really (55:25 - 55:29)
bothered me in the s like there are some (55:27 - 55:31)
hardcore pokemon go players that have (55:29 - 55:32)
probably put thousands of dollars in the (55:31 - 55:33)
game (55:32 - 55:35)
or people that put twenty dollars a week (55:33 - 55:38)
into just raid passes alone (55:35 - 55:42)
and as much as i love that game (55:38 - 55:45)
i play it in a way where like (55:42 - 55:47)
i feel like i'm pretty hardcore at pogo (55:45 - 55:48)
but i'm not hardcore (55:47 - 55:52)
where i need to get like a hundred iv (55:48 - 55:54)
you know reggie gigas or whatever is (55:52 - 55:56)
being featured this week like (55:54 - 55:58)
i like to get my four to five megas and (55:56 - 56:00)
i try to do those with my free and if (55:58 - 56:01)
somebody invites (56:00 - 56:02)
if somebody invites me i almost never (56:01 - 56:04)
declined because i'm like (56:02 - 56:05)
well you invited me and you probably (56:04 - 56:07)
already have enough people and the (56:05 - 56:08)
conveniences here (56:07 - 56:10)
i may be like i haven't spent any money (56:08 - 56:12)
on pogo this year (56:10 - 56:15)
i spent ninety nine dollars i do the (56:12 - 56:16)
hundred dollars because it's easier for (56:15 - 56:17)
my taxes (56:16 - 56:20)
i do did the 100 purchase i think in (56:17 - 56:21)
october (56:20 - 56:23)
and we're almost to june and i still (56:21 - 56:25)
have money um (56:23 - 56:28)
coins coins and i will probably spend (56:25 - 56:29)
the 100 (56:28 - 56:34)
purchase for go fest which is next month (56:29 - 56:35)
and that will probably last me to the (56:34 - 56:38)
end of the year honestly (56:35 - 56:41)
so a lot of money yes yeah i mean like (56:38 - 56:43)
okay so i i did calculate it i spent two (56:41 - 56:44)
hundred (56:43 - 56:46)
and thirty dollars i think last year in (56:44 - 56:48)
pogo um which comes to (56:46 - 56:52)
what fifteen dollars a month (56:48 - 56:52)
this morning (56:52 - 56:56)
[Laughter] (56:53 - 56:58)
but i like pogo a lot but again i know i (56:56 - 57:00)
i personally know pogo players that (56:58 - 57:00)
spend (57:00 - 57:03)
yeah like 20 a week and that's totally (57:00 - 57:04)
cool (57:03 - 57:08)
in apex legends i (57:04 - 57:08)
i i with my pogo purchase i don't think (57:08 - 57:12)
i ever felt like (57:10 - 57:14)
ugh i i'm so mad that i spent 200 in (57:12 - 57:17)
2020 on pogo i don't think i ever felt (57:14 - 57:17)
that (57:17 - 57:18)
there was only one time in the five (57:17 - 57:20)
years of pogo where i felt actually (57:18 - 57:23)
screwed over and that was that like (57:20 - 57:25)
first egg event they did with like (57:23 - 57:29)
uh it was like kabuto omonite aerodactyl (57:25 - 57:32)
it was like the very first extravaganza (57:29 - 57:33)
and i bought a bunch of incubators and i (57:32 - 57:35)
felt completely ripped off and (57:33 - 57:37)
me and i don't even regret that because (57:35 - 57:39)
i just don't buy incubators anymore (57:37 - 57:42)
i just i think incubators are just not a (57:39 - 57:43)
fun part of the game (57:42 - 57:46)
oh i know an incubator that you'd buy i (57:43 - 57:48)
can see your office right now (57:46 - 57:51)
oh the the so in like apex legends i (57:48 - 57:52)
already said i bought (57:51 - 57:54)
seven of the eight battle passes so (57:52 - 57:56)
that's seventy dollars right (57:54 - 58:00)
and then i think i've only given the (57:56 - 58:01)
game like 50 bucks (58:00 - 58:02)
during their like two year anniversary (58:01 - 58:04)
event and i regretted that purchase i (58:02 - 58:06)
was like (58:04 - 58:07)
i'm just cool with the battle passes (58:06 - 58:09)
like the fifty dollars into ap but apex (58:07 - 58:10)
legends they charge like twenty dollars (58:09 - 58:11)
for a skin (58:10 - 58:13)
and it's like i think it's highway (58:11 - 58:15)
robbery i think like you're charging (58:13 - 58:17)
this much for a skin that (58:15 - 58:18)
like you can't even see because you're (58:17 - 58:20)
in first person and no one else cares (58:18 - 58:21)
because they're gonna kill you in like (58:20 - 58:22)
10 seconds (58:21 - 58:25)
um (58:22 - 58:25)
but uh (58:25 - 58:31)
if the skins were cheaper i would (58:29 - 58:32)
probably actually buy them (58:31 - 58:34)
because i like that game like i would (58:32 - 58:35)
probably buy the skins for the (58:34 - 58:38)
characters that i care about (58:35 - 58:40)
so it depends with unite like if the (58:38 - 58:41)
skins (58:40 - 58:45)
for kramer ant or for el degas or for (58:41 - 58:47)
cinderacci whoever i decide i like in (58:45 - 58:48)
that game if they're like three four (58:47 - 58:49)
dollars (58:48 - 58:51)
i will probably buy them if they're ten (58:49 - 58:52)
fifteen dollars (58:51 - 58:54)
i probably won't that's absolutely much (58:52 - 58:56)
yeah which is like kind of weird because (58:54 - 58:57)
again in apex (58:56 - 59:00)
i i feel like i'm it's such a rip-off (58:57 - 59:03)
but i know people in apex that spend a (59:00 - 59:05)
lot of money on the skins and the loot (59:03 - 59:06)
boxes (59:05 - 59:08)
and it's clearly working i mean respawn (59:06 - 59:09)
has been doing it for two years i (59:08 - 59:11)
haven't lowered the price on skin so (59:09 - 59:13)
somebody is spending 20 (59:11 - 59:14)
on that kind of stuff i just think (59:13 - 59:16)
that's too expensive but i also think (59:14 - 59:18)
rocket radar is and pogo for two bucks (59:16 - 59:19)
for a rocket radar (59:18 - 59:21)
i think that's way too expensive but (59:19 - 59:23)
somebody must be buying them yeah (59:21 - 59:27)
i mean bobby with like buying characters (59:23 - 59:30)
is i don't know if i'm gonna like their (59:27 - 59:32)
playstyle i don't know if i'm gonna like (59:30 - 59:32)
how they play (59:32 - 59:34)
i don't know if i'm gonna like that role (59:32 - 59:36)
so that's why you need to watch youtube (59:34 - 59:36)
greg (59:36 - 59:38)
yeah but that's not me playing yet (59:36 - 59:40)
that's me watching somebody play it (59:38 - 59:42)
so if it's the thing that i have a (59:40 - 59:43)
problem with (59:42 - 59:46)
with characters locked behind things is (59:43 - 59:48)
when i make that purchase (59:46 - 59:52)
and i end up just not liking their (59:48 - 59:55)
play style i definitely feel ripped off (59:52 - 59:55)
or i feel like (59:55 - 59:58)
that was a terrible purchase and so i (59:55 - 59:59)
just definitely don't (59:58 - 60:01)
buy them because i don't know if i'm (59:59 - 60:02)
going to like (60:01 - 60:04)
so i don't like characters or playstyles (60:02 - 60:06)
locked behind a purchase (60:04 - 60:08)
i feel it's like where we're gonna force (60:06 - 60:10)
you to buy this and you (60:08 - 60:11)
probably gonna hate it so we just got (60:10 - 60:13)
your money and i don't (60:11 - 60:16)
i don't like that feeling in me (60:13 - 60:19)
yeah i don't know how yeah i guess we (60:16 - 60:20)
don't know how long you have to like (60:19 - 60:22)
grind out the game to buy a character (60:20 - 60:23)
for free (60:22 - 60:25)
versus well how about you know the (60:23 - 60:26)
characters and pokemon unite (60:25 - 60:30)
at all yeah we know we know skins are an (60:26 - 60:31)
issue (60:30 - 60:32)
but they said characters well you have (60:31 - 60:34)
to unlock them (60:32 - 60:37)
um so yeah (60:34 - 60:39)
i'm pretty sure cramer ansel and unlock (60:37 - 60:40)
like i don't think they give you cram (60:39 - 60:41)
around for free (60:40 - 60:44)
okay i think i think way too good to (60:41 - 60:45)
unlock they're gonna make people pay for (60:44 - 60:46)
that no (60:45 - 60:48)
yeah i think it's it i think it's if (60:46 - 60:50)
we're gonna speculate i think it's an (60:48 - 60:52)
order like those first couple pokemon (60:50 - 60:55)
are the free ones and then like alolan (60:52 - 60:56)
nine tails cramer ant (60:55 - 60:58)
when you get to the end of the list i (60:56 - 61:00)
bet those are the ones that you either (60:58 - 61:01)
have to pay for if you want them (61:00 - 61:02)
instantly (61:01 - 61:04)
or you grind out the currency but again (61:02 - 61:05)
we don't know how like in (61:04 - 61:07)
apex sorry i keep going back to apex but (61:05 - 61:09)
in apex (61:07 - 61:11)
i have so much of that currency the free (61:09 - 61:12)
currency (61:11 - 61:14)
whenever they release a character i can (61:12 - 61:15)
buy them instantly for free (61:14 - 61:18)
because i i just have so much of it so (61:15 - 61:20)
but at the beginning of apex in season (61:18 - 61:21)
one (61:20 - 61:24)
i would have had to play like 30 to 40 (61:21 - 61:27)
hours to get the two characters (61:24 - 61:29)
but since they only do one character (61:27 - 61:30)
every three months (61:29 - 61:33)
like i i have enough i have more than (61:30 - 61:34)
enough when that (61:33 - 61:36)
three months is up in the new character (61:34 - 61:37)
i have enough of that frequency so i've (61:36 - 61:38)
never had to buy a character besides (61:37 - 61:40)
like the very first week the game came (61:38 - 61:42)
out i bought mirage (61:40 - 61:43)
and then i had enough free currency to (61:42 - 61:45)
get caustic and then i've never bought a (61:43 - 61:47)
character since (61:45 - 61:49)
um so i think that's what it will (61:47 - 61:50)
probably be for for this (61:49 - 61:53)
is like you play for a little bit you (61:50 - 61:54)
unlock 2k (61:53 - 61:56)
like there's probably somebody who on (61:54 - 61:58)
day one i guarantee you there's like (61:56 - 61:59)
gonna be a handful of people on day one (61:58 - 62:00)
this game comes out they're just gonna (61:59 - 62:01)
unlock all the characters with paid (62:00 - 62:03)
money they're gonna be like i want it (62:01 - 62:04)
all (62:03 - 62:06)
and that's fine like they probably want (62:04 - 62:08)
to just try them all and feel (62:06 - 62:09)
fill out what they like because the (62:08 - 62:12)
faster you find a character you like (62:09 - 62:13)
the faster you enjoy the game i mean (62:12 - 62:15)
yeah there are people who know (62:13 - 62:16)
themselves sufficiently to know (62:15 - 62:20)
like i love mobas i love pokemon pokemon (62:16 - 62:20)
moba (62:20 - 62:25)
take my money right that's that's not us (62:20 - 62:29)
but those people do exist out there (62:25 - 62:29)
i hope i love this game the problem is (62:30 - 62:35)
you'll love it for like a month and a (62:33 - 62:37)
half it's it's it's gonna ask for too (62:35 - 62:38)
much time from you (62:37 - 62:40)
i think the the other thing it's asking (62:38 - 62:42)
is it's asking for four other people (62:40 - 62:44)
right like the game is probably gonna be (62:42 - 62:46)
more enjoyable when you're playing with (62:44 - 62:47)
certain people especially when those (62:46 - 62:47)
people (62:47 - 62:50)
are people you can have a good time with (62:47 - 62:51)
like i (62:50 - 62:54)
play apex with irene and i play apex (62:51 - 62:56)
with my friend jesse (62:54 - 63:00)
and even though we lose a lot (62:56 - 63:02)
like we still have a super good time and (63:00 - 63:03)
we're never like toxic to each other (63:02 - 63:04)
right i'm never like (63:03 - 63:07)
oh why did you do this that costed us (63:04 - 63:09)
the match like (63:07 - 63:11)
but in apex it's very fast it's a it's a (63:09 - 63:13)
battle royale so if you die right away (63:11 - 63:15)
in the first 10 seconds you just go okay (63:13 - 63:16)
we drop again (63:15 - 63:18)
right like you just get back into it i'm (63:16 - 63:19)
from everything i've heard from mobas (63:18 - 63:20)
it's like (63:19 - 63:23)
oh you play for 45 minutes and then you (63:20 - 63:24)
lose yes (63:23 - 63:27)
yes actually that actually sounds like (63:24 - 63:29)
an awful experience (63:27 - 63:31)
i mean i don't remember the one i don't (63:29 - 63:32)
even remember the one that i played i (63:31 - 63:34)
don't think it ever lasted that long (63:32 - 63:36)
was there was there a world of warcraft (63:34 - 63:38)
one (63:36 - 63:41)
uh i don't think so (63:38 - 63:43)
this is okay what we really need to be (63:41 - 63:44)
are you talking about heroes of the (63:43 - 63:46)
storm (63:44 - 63:48)
yeah here's the storm was the moba for (63:46 - 63:50)
that yeah that was it i played that (63:48 - 63:52)
maybe we need what we need to really be (63:50 - 63:54)
on the lookout for keep our ears to the (63:52 - 63:55)
ground (63:54 - 63:58)
etc which i don't know this you may (63:55 - 64:02)
guys maybe not be familiar with this (63:58 - 64:05)
but the pokemon unite version of auto (64:02 - 64:06)
chess (64:05 - 64:09)
oh i've heard of arlo chess see because (64:06 - 64:11)
that (64:09 - 64:14)
is what i could get into low commitment (64:11 - 64:17)
still access to the same characters okay (64:14 - 64:18)
what is auto chest (64:17 - 64:22)
it's basically you hmm (64:18 - 64:25)
wait i got it because you guys explained (64:22 - 64:26)
to me what advanced (64:25 - 64:30)
wars was imagine advanced wars (64:26 - 64:33)
except you set up a team of pokemon and (64:30 - 64:33)
then (64:33 - 64:36)
say all right go battle the other (64:33 - 64:38)
person's team of pokemon and then you (64:36 - 64:41)
watch what happens (64:38 - 64:42)
yeah that sounds pretty good it's kind (64:41 - 64:44)
of like chess you pick your pieces but (64:42 - 64:45)
it's (64:44 - 64:48)
auto they fight on their own i'm into (64:45 - 64:48)
that (64:48 - 64:50)
that sounds awesome set it and forget it (64:48 - 64:53)
is the life (64:50 - 64:55)
all right let's take uh one more break i (64:53 - 64:57)

we got the peppermint mocha (65:53 - 65:56)
we are back from our break two things (66:00 - 66:04)
number one (66:03 - 66:07)
is uh shout out to everyone who swung by (66:04 - 66:10)
our charity stream this past weekend we (66:07 - 66:11)
raised over (66:10 - 66:14)
four thousand dollars for trans (66:11 - 66:18)
lifeline and that was really exciting uh (66:14 - 66:20)
if you're listening to this podcast that (66:18 - 66:21)
is still (66:20 - 66:25)
opened until the end of monday so if you (66:21 - 66:25)
wanted to (66:25 - 66:27)
donate as well to our cause you're more (66:25 - 66:29)
than welcome to (66:27 - 66:32)
uh and yeah greg and i uh (66:29 - 66:34)
discussed with steve we all think that (66:32 - 66:37)
it is a very valuable organization so (66:34 - 66:40)
definitely 100 support (66:37 - 66:44)
everybody giving what they can yes (66:40 - 66:46)
so yeah we wanted to make sure we did (66:44 - 66:48)
something for pride (66:46 - 66:52)
uh and so we focused on uh a trans (66:48 - 66:54)
charity this this year and uh very happy (66:52 - 66:55)
with that choice (66:54 - 66:58)
yeah it's a good it's a good group you (66:55 - 66:59)
made good money (66:58 - 67:02)
good all around keep going yeah it was a (66:59 - 67:04)
fun stream we ended up going for eight (67:02 - 67:06)
hours we played some pokemon gale of (67:04 - 67:06)
darkness (67:06 - 67:08)
did you finally complete your hundred (67:06 - 67:09)
battles i did and that (67:08 - 67:11)
was the game i can't wait till you do it (67:09 - 67:13)
again for your next set it's gonna go (67:11 - 67:15)
we can then now move to ruby and (67:13 - 67:16)
sapphire and suffer with (67:15 - 67:19)
pokey blocks i think is the thing in (67:16 - 67:20)
that game right (67:19 - 67:23)
i feel like suffer is putting a negative (67:20 - 67:26)
spin on a fun part of the game (67:23 - 67:28)
um wait isn't blocks one of those ones (67:26 - 67:30)
where everybody contributes a little bit (67:28 - 67:32)
and then you can't get something out (67:30 - 67:33)
it's like kind of like the egg spinner (67:32 - 67:36)
and yeah problem with pokey blocks is if (67:33 - 67:38)
you mess it up you can't undo it (67:36 - 67:41)
it's like permanent kind of like a curry (67:38 - 67:43)
um (67:41 - 67:45)
uh the other thing is the other thing is (67:43 - 67:47)
apple podcasts just rolled out their (67:45 - 67:48)
subscription (67:47 - 67:51)
and i do know that 60 of our listeners (67:48 - 67:53)
listen through apple podcast it's (67:51 - 67:54)
actually kind of crazy how high that is (67:53 - 67:56)
but because we've been doing this (67:54 - 67:59)
for 11 years apple podcast was like the (67:56 - 68:00)
dominant thing (67:59 - 68:04)
for the first two um spotify wasn't a (68:00 - 68:04)
podcast (68:04 - 68:07)
provider three months three years ago (68:04 - 68:09)
so a lot of newer podcasts will probably (68:07 - 68:11)
be like heavier on spotify (68:09 - 68:12)
but because we've been around for so (68:11 - 68:14)
long our audience is very heavy on apple (68:12 - 68:15)
podcast (68:14 - 68:19)
and because i know that uh a lot of (68:15 - 68:21)
i know that it's a challenge to get (68:19 - 68:22)
people to go to our patreon page because (68:21 - 68:24)
you're listening to an audio only (68:22 - 68:25)
podcast you're probably running at the (68:24 - 68:25)
gym (68:25 - 68:28)
you're probably driving your car uh but (68:25 - 68:30)
uh we're gonna turn that on that should (68:28 - 68:33)
be on so if you want our premium feed (68:30 - 68:36)
of the two bonus episodes we do a month (68:33 - 68:38)
we've already done two this month will (68:36 - 68:39)
actually be probably a third bonus (68:38 - 68:41)
episode this month (68:39 - 68:44)
but you can get will greg and myself e3 (68:41 - 68:45)
thoughts (68:44 - 68:47)
that podcast is now up in the premium (68:45 - 68:49)
feed for both apple podcast and for the (68:47 - 68:50)
patreon (68:49 - 68:52)
premium feed and then you can get (68:50 - 68:55)
irene's and my thoughts on the first (68:52 - 68:57)
half of the season for pokemon journeys (68:55 - 69:00)
uh that was another hour episode (68:57 - 69:01)
where we talk about our favorite (69:00 - 69:02)
episodes and what we like and don't like (69:01 - 69:03)
about journeys (69:02 - 69:05)
and then you get access to the episodes (69:03 - 69:07)
that came out last month (69:05 - 69:09)
and all the bonus episodes there uh the (69:07 - 69:10)
difference is both are (69:09 - 69:11)
the the same as they're both five (69:10 - 69:13)
dollars if you subscribe an apple (69:11 - 69:15)
podcast or you subscribe on patreon (69:13 - 69:17)
the difference is uh apple doesn't share (69:15 - 69:18)
your email (69:17 - 69:20)
i don't know who you are you don't get (69:18 - 69:21)
access to the slack (69:20 - 69:23)
so if you care about the privacy end of (69:21 - 69:25)
it apple podcast (69:23 - 69:27)
um if you want to join the slack and get (69:25 - 69:29)
the other benefits that slack has to (69:27 - 69:29)
offer (69:29 - 69:31)
or sorry patreon has to offer you can (69:29 - 69:35)
join the patreon patreon.com (69:31 - 69:37)
uh but we're gonna tr where i'm gonna (69:35 - 69:38)
turn on the apple thing if like three (69:37 - 69:39)
people use it (69:38 - 69:42)
i guess that's fifteen more dollars (69:39 - 69:46)
yeah right but uh i wanna try to make it (69:42 - 69:47)
so (69:46 - 69:50)
if you want the premium podcast (69:47 - 69:53)
and you're you're already in the apple (69:50 - 69:55)
ecosystem and you want to support that (69:53 - 69:56)
way (69:55 - 69:57)
there's no reason for me not to turn it (69:56 - 70:00)
on it's just i just have to upload it to (69:57 - 70:01)
there every week so it's a little bit (70:00 - 70:03)
more work for me but (70:01 - 70:05)
if like i said if three people decide (70:03 - 70:06)
that that's where they want to support (70:05 - 70:08)
totally okay with it i'm just gonna turn (70:06 - 70:10)
that option on but if you're already on (70:08 - 70:11)
patreon don't worry about it (70:10 - 70:13)
everything's gonna be the same (70:11 - 70:16)
um so yeah speaking (70:13 - 70:19)
of iphones and mobile uh pokemon go live (70:16 - 70:21)
revamped their entire website the first (70:19 - 70:23)
time in five years their website is (70:21 - 70:24)
completely different it looks better i (70:23 - 70:26)
don't know if it is actually better but (70:24 - 70:28)
visually it looks better (70:26 - 70:31)
uh but there is some pokemon go news (70:28 - 70:33)
here reggie giggis is now in five-star (70:31 - 70:34)
raids because the summer solstice (70:33 - 70:36)
is around i don't know if that's a good (70:34 - 70:37)
enough reason for reggie case to be in (70:36 - 70:40)
raids but that's the reason niantic gave (70:37 - 70:42)

back back on the bad list because (71:55 - 72:00)
he invited me to a remote reggie gigas (71:58 - 72:03)
raid which i used my remote raid pass to (72:00 - 72:04)
do (72:03 - 72:07)
but he only had five people so we failed (72:04 - 72:08)
like literally like it was one of those (72:07 - 72:11)
ones where like you're running (72:08 - 72:13)
ran out the clock yeah reggie giggs had (72:11 - 72:15)
like one sliver of health (72:13 - 72:17)
then dude messages me and he's like oh i (72:15 - 72:19)

okay do it again so i went in on his (72:19 - 72:23)
invite did it again (72:22 - 72:26)
he didn't have more people he lied it (72:23 - 72:27)
was five (72:26 - 72:29)
people literally the same thing happened (72:27 - 72:30)
again (72:29 - 72:33)
we didn't get the reggie giggish who did (72:30 - 72:35)
anyone met go (72:33 - 72:37)

metagross coming i don't know what is (72:44 - 72:48)
mega salamance coming (72:46 - 72:49)
you just asked for the one two of the (72:48 - 72:52)
most popular megas (72:49 - 72:54)
are they not valid questions anyways i (72:52 - 72:56)
have a shiny regular guess and y'all (72:54 - 72:57)
don't and i (72:56 - 73:00)
got it first uh real game player right (72:57 - 73:01)
here i'm amazing (73:00 - 73:03)
true uh pokemon go fest t-shirt will be (73:01 - 73:06)
available it is available (73:03 - 73:09)
uh it is in the store unlike last year (73:06 - 73:11)
they sold out of these shirts (73:09 - 73:14)
in in in like two hours (73:11 - 73:17)
it's because those shirts were good no (73:14 - 73:18)
there's a bad red (73:17 - 73:21)
it wasn't into the am red it was like (73:18 - 73:21)
this (73:21 - 73:25)
bad like these shirts aren't good (73:21 - 73:26)
why do people have a problem with these (73:25 - 73:28)
shirts i think they're great they're (73:26 - 73:31)
too noisy what are you they're they're (73:28 - 73:34)
red blue and white that's it (73:31 - 73:36)
are you not are you blind do you not see (73:34 - 73:37)
the (73:36 - 73:39)
many things that are all over the red (73:37 - 73:42)
blue but it looks like uh (73:39 - 73:44)
like a mountain and a city and then (73:42 - 73:45)
there's this big yellow (73:44 - 73:47)
tower in the middle it's a hot it looks (73:45 - 73:49)
chaotic (73:47 - 73:51)
look you have lost all right to say what (73:49 - 73:53)
is and isn't good based off of your (73:51 - 73:55)
recent purchases (73:53 - 73:56)
i don't know what i've recently (73:55 - 73:59)
purchased myself (73:56 - 74:02)
oh this watch band is incredible (73:59 - 74:05)
oh my gosh i had to return it though i (74:02 - 74:06)
needed a smaller size (74:05 - 74:08)
i thought they measured your wrist with (74:06 - 74:10)
the special wrist measurer (74:08 - 74:12)
did use the special wrist measurer but (74:10 - 74:14)
they didn't say that these eventually (74:12 - 74:15)
like they get a little stretch after the (74:14 - 74:18)
first week (74:15 - 74:18)
they expand a little bit you break them (74:18 - 74:22)
in (74:20 - 74:24)
so then the one i got which fit perfect (74:22 - 74:25)
it expanded (74:24 - 74:27)
and then it was a little loose sounds (74:25 - 74:29)
like an ugly watch band (74:27 - 74:32)
with mechanical problems anyways the (74:29 - 74:34)
shirts are now available in pokemon (74:32 - 74:35)
center (74:34 - 74:37)
the reason that this may be important (74:35 - 74:39)
because this is how you get the (74:37 - 74:40)
professor (74:39 - 74:43)
willow's tcg card (74:40 - 74:45)
which is the collaboration between the (74:43 - 74:48)
tcg and pokemon go (74:45 - 74:49)
it's professor's research it's exactly (74:48 - 74:51)
what all the other professors do discard (74:49 - 74:53)
your hand draw seven cards (74:51 - 74:55)
the card also has a special promo code (74:53 - 74:57)
on it printed (74:55 - 75:00)
and then if you use the code you'll get (74:57 - 75:01)
special research and go (75:00 - 75:03)
where you'll be able to encounter mel (75:01 - 75:05)
tan and earn (75:03 - 75:06)
items on your journey which i get that (75:05 - 75:08)
makes sense you know mel tan is the (75:06 - 75:09)
mythical that came from go (75:08 - 75:13)
i make sense uh (75:09 - 75:15)
if you buy anything on pokemon (75:13 - 75:18)
center.com that's under the pokemon go (75:15 - 75:22)
category shirt egg incubator (75:18 - 75:25)
water bottle team mystic hat water (75:22 - 75:27)
bottles are sold out (75:25 - 75:29)
water bottle don't buy the water bottle (75:27 - 75:31)
can't if you buy any pokemon go things (75:29 - 75:33)
it will come with the card it will auto (75:31 - 75:36)
add it to your cart (75:33 - 75:39)
um water bottles are team mystic hat (75:36 - 75:40)
also (75:39 - 75:42)
sold out but if you want team valor or (75:40 - 75:44)
team instinct those hats are available (75:42 - 75:47)
there's a new go lanyard they added (75:44 - 75:49)
that's kind of cool there's the (75:47 - 75:52)
gengar beanie which is not perfect (75:49 - 75:55)
why would you wear that in the summer (75:52 - 75:59)
why not not summer everywhere true (75:55 - 76:01)
it's yeah it's true it's like winter in (75:59 - 76:02)
australia right yeah (76:01 - 76:05)
it's like they're snowed in because (76:02 - 76:07)
that's what happens (76:05 - 76:10)
i was so into the varsity (76:07 - 76:13)
i got instinct fleece varsity and then (76:10 - 76:16)
it says hoodie and i'm out (76:13 - 76:19)
oh yeah yeah the hoodies it just if it (76:16 - 76:21)
was detachable (76:19 - 76:23)
i wouldn't maybe make the pushes take (76:21 - 76:24)
the hey take the (76:23 - 76:26)
stop stop you're really hate you live in (76:24 - 76:28)
minnesota at some point you're going to (76:26 - 76:30)
be like i better put my hood up (76:28 - 76:33)
it's called a hat yeah but the (76:30 - 76:35)
hat doesn't cover the back of the net (76:33 - 76:36)
true agreed yeah (76:35 - 76:40)
a hood sucks all the cold air in as the (76:36 - 76:41)
wind hits your face and it gets that cat (76:40 - 76:43)
they're not doing it wrong they've got (76:41 - 76:45)
drawstrings buddy yeah (76:43 - 76:47)
then i'm shrinking my face and i look (76:45 - 76:49)
like a south park (76:47 - 76:51)
character it doesn't matter how you look (76:49 - 76:54)
in the winter as long as you're warm (76:51 - 76:57)
yes agreed it always matters how you (76:54 - 76:59)

friends in france (80:30 - 80:35)
uh it takes me to their clothing website (80:33 - 80:36)
but i don't see the pokemon stuff (80:35 - 80:39)
specifically (80:36 - 80:42)
also this website is in french i it's (80:39 - 80:43)
very hard for me to navigate it (80:42 - 80:47)
i found a purse and some earrings (80:43 - 80:48)
they have a big pokeball that you can (80:47 - 80:51)
get inside and lots of pikachu balloons (80:48 - 80:54)
that's true can i type pokemon on their (80:51 - 80:55)
store website (80:54 - 81:01)
oh it did work (80:55 - 81:03)
uh okay so they're selling the levi's (81:01 - 81:04)
stuff (81:03 - 81:06)
they're selling the levi's i mean it's a (81:04 - 81:08)
mall i guess that makes sense (81:06 - 81:11)
oh here's some of it uh there's like a (81:08 - 81:13)
black and white pikachu shirt that's (81:11 - 81:13)
pretty cool (81:13 - 81:15)
oh this one's really cool this audio (81:13 - 81:18)
shows really (81:15 - 81:18)
the problem unfortunately is (81:18 - 81:24)
we don't have a lot of listeners in (81:22 - 81:25)
france because (81:24 - 81:29)
our french is poor to middling at best (81:25 - 81:31)
i mean i'm technically fluent but i (81:29 - 81:33)
haven't used it in a very long time (81:31 - 81:35)
but i have a lot of friends there so (81:33 - 81:36)
this is what i'll say about (81:35 - 81:39)
for for audio listeners is what i will (81:36 - 81:41)
say about their collection (81:39 - 81:42)
it is better than the levi's collection (81:41 - 81:44)
but that is that was a low bar (81:42 - 81:50)
yeah it is levi's collection was very (81:44 - 81:50)
90s in style well then i get back (81:50 - 81:58)
i really like the black t-shirt with the (81:55 - 82:00)
pikachu on the back it is very cute (81:58 - 82:02)
it was like pikachu's butt right yeah (82:00 - 82:03)
yeah i like that one too i like this (82:02 - 82:05)
yellow one with a very cute shirt i (82:03 - 82:05)
would (82:05 - 82:07)
i would take that shirt in a heartbeat (82:05 - 82:08)
the (82:07 - 82:10)
the yellow one with the bunch of pikachu (82:08 - 82:12)
faces in the shoulder that one (82:10 - 82:13)
that one's very cute too yeah i like (82:12 - 82:15)
that one a lot uh the long t-shirt with (82:13 - 82:17)
the pikachu's all over is pretty cute (82:15 - 82:20)

question (82:42 - 82:47)
of the week i want to hear (82:43 - 82:51)
the question question of the week (82:47 - 82:54)
let's have the question (82:51 - 82:58)
[Music] (82:54 - 82:58)
ah i give you so much time and you're (82:58 - 83:03)
just like not (83:02 - 83:05)
ever ready it is i'm ready this this is (83:03 - 83:07)
from kane (83:05 - 83:10)
is that how you say it we don't know (83:07 - 83:11)
what you're looking at (83:10 - 83:13)
i'm looking at the attic channel in our (83:11 - 83:15)
slack i don't go there i don't think i'm (83:13 - 83:16)
invited (83:15 - 83:19)
how is it spelled k (83:16 - 83:22)
a k-a-y-n-e okay yeah i think it's gay (83:19 - 83:27)
kanye so sure how do you spell kanye (83:22 - 83:30)
k-a-n-y-e do you not listen to kanye i (83:27 - 83:32)
even i've heard a kanye song (83:30 - 83:34)
yeah but i don't think i've ever wrote (83:32 - 83:36)
kanye's name or tried to spell it before (83:34 - 83:40)
you haven't read a news article about (83:36 - 83:44)
mr kanye west my education model (83:40 - 83:48)
oh here we go subpar blame it on the (83:44 - 83:48)
i don't think milwaukee public school (83:51 - 83:54)
system (83:54 - 83:57)
covers anything kanye west when you were (83:54 - 83:59)
going to high school or now (83:57 - 84:02)
you'd be surprised (83:59 - 84:04)
they write in and say what is your (84:02 - 84:07)
favorite song slash track from any game (84:04 - 84:10)
or the anime (84:07 - 84:10)
it's not always black and white that was (84:11 - 84:16)
a very easy answer for me because i have (84:14 - 84:17)
one there's one (84:16 - 84:21)
pokemon song from a pokemon game that is (84:17 - 84:21)
on my (84:21 - 84:25)
uh never skip list so if it comes up in (84:21 - 84:26)
the rotation i always listen to the (84:25 - 84:29)
whole thing (84:26 - 84:29)
which is you guys don't know (84:29 - 84:35)
i i hope it's not like ends lullaby or (84:32 - 84:36)
something bad like that (84:35 - 84:40)
wow all of all of n's music (84:36 - 84:43)
low-key terrible all right here's your (84:40 - 84:43)
clue (84:43 - 84:45)
we're do it we'll have an extra pokemon (84:43 - 84:46)
of the week (84:45 - 84:50)
there is one city in pokemon black and (84:46 - 84:52)
white and i believe in black and white (84:50 - 84:52)
too (84:52 - 84:54)
as well i think they continued this (84:52 - 84:56)
particular theme i already know the song (84:54 - 84:57)
i already know (84:56 - 85:01)
where there were people dancing (84:57 - 85:04)
and as part of the dancing they (85:01 - 85:06)
have a song that they all sing together (85:04 - 85:08)
and it's the music for that city (85:06 - 85:10)
yeah i know which city it is i don't (85:08 - 85:11)
know the name of the song but it's it's (85:10 - 85:12)
the it's this (85:11 - 85:14)
it's village bridge it's actually that's (85:12 - 85:17)
what it's called what no (85:14 - 85:20)
no what wrong it's there's no people (85:17 - 85:24)
dancing at village bridge (85:20 - 85:24)
what other song would they be in black (85:24 - 85:27)
and white because in village bridge (85:26 - 85:28)
that's the one where they have like the (85:27 - 85:31)
actual words but you can't understand it (85:28 - 85:33)
no (85:31 - 85:33)
greg (85:35 - 85:37)
oh (85:39 - 85:41)
city at right before you head up the (85:49 - 85:54)
road to dragon spiral tower (85:52 - 85:56)
there's a group of people dancing in a (85:54 - 85:58)
circle and singing a song about the (85:56 - 85:59)
dragons but (85:58 - 86:02)
the music for israel city is my (85:59 - 86:05)
absolute favorite village bridge is (86:02 - 86:07)
pretty good though (86:05 - 86:10)
look you already lost okay village (86:07 - 86:11)
bridge is pretty good (86:10 - 86:15)
um i like all the trumpets in gen 3. oh (86:11 - 86:17)
uh i'm trying to think i have to look at (86:15 - 86:19)
my thing because there's a couple (86:17 - 86:23)
of so like it's it's tough (86:19 - 86:25)
because there's like songs that only (86:23 - 86:27)
appeared in like to be a master that i (86:25 - 86:28)
really really like like (86:27 - 86:30)
i love team rockets rocket and then (86:28 - 86:32)
somebody did the remax of the team (86:30 - 86:34)
rocket song that i really really like (86:32 - 86:37)
uh i i really like i really like the (86:34 - 86:38)
current (86:37 - 86:42)
journeys anime song yeah i like route (86:38 - 86:43)
110 (86:42 - 86:44)
in gen 3 because it's the trumpiest (86:43 - 86:46)
trumpetiest of trumpets (86:44 - 86:48)
i'm trying to think of what is the one (86:46 - 86:49)
song in alola that i really really (86:48 - 86:51)
really while you think about that here's (86:49 - 86:53)
your team rockets rocking story (86:51 - 86:57)
um on when we finish recording (86:53 - 87:00)
drive check on tuesday nights uh i (86:57 - 87:02)
immediately have to give my cat (87:00 - 87:04)
his insulin because i'm already late (87:02 - 87:06)
because that's supposed to happen at 8 (87:04 - 87:06)
pm (87:06 - 87:09)
so as we did that we would start playing (87:06 - 87:12)
team rockets rockin (87:09 - 87:15)
until twitch (87:12 - 87:19)
started muting our video of the day (87:15 - 87:22)
because we were using licensed music (87:19 - 87:24)
how did yeah i was literally just (87:22 - 87:25)
putting my phone down (87:24 - 87:33)
next to the microphone (87:25 - 87:37)
uh i would say usually (87:33 - 87:39)
i'm pretty sure the the museum music is (87:37 - 87:40)
relatively the same (87:39 - 87:42)
between games um they don't change it (87:40 - 87:44)
dramatically they change some i don't i (87:42 - 87:46)
don't know music well enough to know if (87:44 - 87:46)
it's like tempo (87:46 - 87:50)
or beat or whatever but the the ocean (87:46 - 87:51)
museum (87:50 - 87:53)
music in gen 3 which is kind of similar (87:51 - 87:55)
to the museum music in gen 1 but (87:53 - 87:56)
slightly different (87:55 - 87:58)
which is kind of similar to the ssn (87:56 - 87:59)
music anyways (87:58 - 88:01)
that that track very good i like the (87:59 - 88:03)
ocean specifically the gen 3 one (88:01 - 88:06)
the ocean music ocean oceanic music (88:03 - 88:08)
museum or whatever (88:06 - 88:10)

no pokemon stuff no yeah with (92:11 - 92:18)
for me with like (92:15 - 92:18)
now that my job is pokemon i i can be a (92:18 - 92:22)
little more flexible (92:21 - 92:23)
because you can write it all off on your (92:22 - 92:25)
tracks i can write stuff off but i'm (92:23 - 92:27)
still pretty conservative when it comes (92:25 - 92:29)
to like (92:27 - 92:30)
like when i when i go to pokemon center (92:29 - 92:32)
and i'm like do i need 10 more sitting (92:30 - 92:33)
cuties (92:32 - 92:35)
no i don't have any space for them um (92:33 - 92:37)
that's true (92:35 - 92:38)
and then with pokemon cards even though (92:37 - 92:40)
we we i only primarily at this point (92:38 - 92:42)
open pokemon cards on stream (92:40 - 92:44)
uh my thought process behind pokemon (92:42 - 92:46)
cards is i want (92:44 - 92:48)
just one of every elite trainer box i (92:46 - 92:50)
want one of every (92:48 - 92:51)
side box because they usually come with (92:50 - 92:53)
a promo card and then i want one (92:51 - 92:55)
booster box and that's kind of it (92:53 - 92:57)
because i'm collecting (92:55 - 92:58)
but i also because i'm trying to collect (92:57 - 93:00)
sets but i also know like (92:58 - 93:02)
at a certain point you just buy singles (93:00 - 93:04)
it's it's just not financially (93:02 - 93:06)
correct to keep buying booster boxes (93:04 - 93:07)
because you're (93:06 - 93:11)
you're not going to beat the odds um yes (93:07 - 93:12)
i love cracking packs man (93:11 - 93:15)
yeah i do like so i have to draw a line (93:12 - 93:17)
somewhere there i do like to i do (93:15 - 93:20)
tend with my budgeting to put that money (93:17 - 93:22)
towards something that i feel like (93:20 - 93:24)
will be special or more rare in the (93:22 - 93:25)
future (93:24 - 93:29)
like the 100 pokeball things that (93:25 - 93:30)
they don't they don't do anything they (93:29 - 93:32)
just like they have that touch proximity (93:30 - 93:34)
and they have that touch sensing they (93:32 - 93:36)
light up and they're metal (93:34 - 93:37)
i did a youtube video about them just (93:36 - 93:39)
showing like hey they don't really do (93:37 - 93:40)
anything but this is what they do do (93:39 - 93:42)
like if you slightly hover your hand it (93:40 - 93:44)
like lights up because it has that (93:42 - 93:46)
sense and i don't know if like i don't i (93:44 - 93:48)
don't (93:46 - 93:50)
my opinion is that i don't think that (93:48 - 93:52)
convinces anyone to (93:50 - 93:54)
spend a hundred dollars on it but i also (93:52 - 93:55)
don't know how expensive is that (93:54 - 93:57)
technology to justify the hundred (93:55 - 93:59)
dollars that like you're (93:57 - 94:00)
like not touching it but it knows you're (93:59 - 94:01)
not touching it kind of thing i don't (94:00 - 94:04)
know if that's like (94:01 - 94:07)
technology or 99 technology but (94:04 - 94:08)
i knew that that kind of stuff would (94:07 - 94:10)
sell out and that to me was really (94:08 - 94:11)
unique (94:10 - 94:12)
because i can't remember the last time (94:11 - 94:15)
they made metal pokeballs that like (94:12 - 94:16)
light up (94:15 - 94:20)
so i tried to put my money in that (94:16 - 94:24)
you're a sucker for false rarity (94:20 - 94:25)
i mean they're sold out everywhere (94:24 - 94:26)
they're whatever i mean they could (94:25 - 94:28)
always have made more (94:26 - 94:30)
yeah yeah they could have made more but (94:28 - 94:32)
i mean they could have made more of the (94:30 - 94:34)
burger king (94:32 - 94:34)
pokeball things too and at a certain (94:35 - 94:39)
point (94:38 - 94:41)
at a certain point the market runs dry (94:39 - 94:43)
right at a certain point they they go up (94:41 - 94:44)
in price because (94:43 - 94:46)
or they go down in price i mean they (94:44 - 94:47)
they have slightly gone up in price in (94:46 - 94:48)
the last couple of years (94:47 - 94:51)
just because of the resurgence of (94:48 - 94:52)
pokemon for mainstream (94:51 - 94:56)
uh sold by mu should have sold it okay (94:52 - 94:57)
i'm gonna break uh i'm gonna break (94:56 - 95:01)
uh jc's question down here (94:57 - 95:04)
um what do you think this is a lightning (95:01 - 95:04)
round (95:04 - 95:06)
so just like whatever first comes to (95:04 - 95:07)
mind answer (95:06 - 95:10)
the so the the first question they ask (95:07 - 95:11)
like four questions but the first (95:10 - 95:12)
question they ask is really good why do (95:11 - 95:14)
you think there's enormous gulf between (95:12 - 95:15)
the number of people who play pokemon (95:14 - 95:17)
and those who participate in vgc or (95:15 - 95:18)
other competition (95:17 - 95:22)
um uh toxic one uh toxic (95:18 - 95:25)
uh player environment um i i don't find (95:22 - 95:29)
pvp fun it stresses me out (95:25 - 95:32)
is the is it that despite many ways of (95:29 - 95:33)
game freak has sped up and improved the (95:32 - 95:34)
process of making a team there's still a (95:33 - 95:36)
massive time sink in learning the format (95:34 - 95:37)
yes (95:36 - 95:41)
um uh i'm in the opinion that there's no (95:37 - 95:43)
greater difficulty spice in a video game (95:41 - 95:45)
going from the pokemon campaign to (95:43 - 95:46)
multiplayer the game itself doesn't (95:45 - 95:47)
teach you anything about speed control (95:46 - 95:48)
prediction (95:47 - 95:51)
or what is actually useful you largely (95:48 - 95:52)
have to go outside the game (95:51 - 95:54)
to learn that knowledge let alone basic (95:52 - 95:56)
stuff like pokemon abilities and move (95:54 - 95:59)
pools is there a way this could be a pro (95:56 - 96:00)
improved (95:59 - 96:02)
um and then they reference like (96:00 - 96:04)
picolytics (96:02 - 96:07)
uh and then they say would it even make (96:04 - 96:09)
a difference is there just really a cold (96:07 - 96:10)
hard fact when you have an audience as (96:09 - 96:12)
large and as wide as pokemon (96:10 - 96:14)
is it always going to be the minority (96:12 - 96:16)
that gets into it um (96:14 - 96:17)
i will just be shocked if more than five (96:16 - 96:18)
percent of people even dipped in (96:17 - 96:20)
competitive which seems like a pretty (96:18 - 96:22)
dire number can vgc become mainstream or (96:20 - 96:24)
is it doomed to be a niche forever happy (96:22 - 96:26)
pride (96:24 - 96:26)
i think that's the that's true for (96:26 - 96:29)
everything the majority i mean the (96:28 - 96:31)
majority of people out there (96:29 - 96:35)
do not want to do competitive things (96:31 - 96:37)
and well you're not a game can i bring (96:35 - 96:38)
up apex legend again (96:37 - 96:41)
no like like in apex legends like there (96:38 - 96:42)
is a competitive scene right (96:41 - 96:46)
i will never be there yeah but i enjoy (96:42 - 96:48)
dropping in hopefully getting one or two (96:46 - 96:49)
kills (96:48 - 96:52)
i've i've won apex legend i like have (96:49 - 96:53)
one ranked matches of (96:52 - 96:57)
apex legends um but most of the time i (96:53 - 96:59)
don't and it feels good when i win (96:57 - 97:01)
but the barrier to entry for that game (96:59 - 97:04)
is so low you pick a character you (97:01 - 97:05)
eventually hopefully become good at that (97:04 - 97:07)
character and then you play (97:05 - 97:08)
and there's luck right there's luck of (97:07 - 97:10)
like did i pick up the good armor (97:08 - 97:11)
quickly did i pick up (97:10 - 97:14)
my favorite weapon quickly but they (97:11 - 97:18)
jc is correct there is such a huge (97:14 - 97:19)
learning curve with pokemon true i don't (97:18 - 97:22)
know how they do it better i don't (97:19 - 97:25)
i don't think they can and i don't (97:22 - 97:29)
i don't think that's bad (97:25 - 97:33)
right like so that so (97:29 - 97:36)
mmos have a huge it's a huge divide (97:33 - 97:38)
there's pvp and there's pve (97:36 - 97:40)
and you pick the lane that you're happy (97:38 - 97:43)
in and pvp (97:40 - 97:45)
tends to be a smaller lane depending on (97:43 - 97:48)
the game because it requires a very (97:45 - 97:51)
different mindset it's a very different (97:48 - 97:51)
skill set (97:51 - 97:55)
it's a very different experience and (97:51 - 97:59)
the weird thing about pokemon is you go (97:55 - 98:02)
through a pve experience (97:59 - 98:04)
that that is why most people have bought (98:02 - 98:07)
the game is for a pvp experience and (98:04 - 98:07)
then (98:07 - 98:10)
you are faced with the sudden switch to (98:07 - 98:11)
do a pvp (98:10 - 98:15)
experience which is a very daunting (98:11 - 98:18)
and not for what a lot of people signed (98:15 - 98:18)
up for (98:18 - 98:21)
and i will even tell you before you even (98:18 - 98:23)
get that far (98:21 - 98:26)
the number one thing that causes (98:23 - 98:29)
the majority of people who love playing (98:26 - 98:29)
pokemon (98:29 - 98:32)
and buy every pokemon title that comes (98:29 - 98:34)
out to not play competitive (98:32 - 98:38)
is i cannot bring my team (98:34 - 98:41)
of favorite pokemon to playerverse (98:38 - 98:43)
player (98:41 - 98:46)
yes yeah and expect to win i mean or (98:43 - 98:47)
even be competitive i mean pokemon and (98:46 - 98:49)
other things have (98:47 - 98:53)
you know meta the things that good and (98:49 - 98:56)
favorites aren't (98:53 - 98:58)
there like a lot of favorites aren't (98:56 - 98:59)
gonna (98:58 - 99:02)
aren't gonna be there and for a lot of (98:59 - 99:02)
people that (99:02 - 99:06)
isn't the the goal for (99:02 - 99:09)
competitive is to be competitive (99:06 - 99:13)
and a lot of people don't necessarily (99:09 - 99:13)
come (99:13 - 99:17)
to pokemon for that reason like (99:13 - 99:20)
the one thing that i love about pokemon (99:17 - 99:21)
is there's so many (99:20 - 99:24)
different ways to interact with it and (99:21 - 99:26)
it supports all of those ways and i (99:24 - 99:26)
don't (99:26 - 99:29)
think that competitive (99:26 - 99:33)
pvp needs to be (99:29 - 99:33)
easier it does need to be (99:34 - 99:41)
an easier point of entry (99:38 - 99:43)
i think though that like i get why (99:41 - 99:46)
there's like (99:43 - 99:48)
not a focus but why people think about (99:46 - 99:49)
this competitive (99:48 - 99:52)
is because the game the games have (99:49 - 99:54)
always had (99:52 - 99:57)
the the game is the game's always had (99:54 - 99:58)
battles right (99:57 - 99:59)
yeah you go through the whole game (99:58 - 100:01)
battling you battle eight gym leaders (99:59 - 100:03)
yes you battle the champion you you the (100:01 - 100:05)
game tells you you are the best pokemon (100:03 - 100:07)
trainer (100:05 - 100:09)
so the game gives you that confidence of (100:07 - 100:10)
being like (100:09 - 100:13)
well i'm the best pokemon trainer i can (100:10 - 100:15)
beat other trainers (100:13 - 100:18)
and you can't other trainers are better (100:15 - 100:18)
than you (100:18 - 100:21)
um but the game at least gives you that (100:18 - 100:22)
that concept (100:21 - 100:24)
and this this was like very apparent to (100:22 - 100:26)
me when i started the show when i (100:24 - 100:29)
started ise and it was like heart gold (100:26 - 100:30)
soul silver going into black and white (100:29 - 100:33)
i thought i was really good at pokemon (100:30 - 100:35)
um because in my circle of friends i was (100:33 - 100:37)
good at pokemon (100:35 - 100:40)
but in the world of pokemon i am not (100:37 - 100:40)
good (100:40 - 100:43)
uh and i have tried to get better over (100:40 - 100:44)
the years (100:43 - 100:46)
and the pokemon company has tried to (100:44 - 100:47)
make (100:46 - 100:49)
that easier to get into with like (100:47 - 100:50)
ability capsules and (100:49 - 100:52)
the hit the rare ability capsules and (100:50 - 100:53)
the bottle caps (100:52 - 100:56)
and vitamins being easier to purchase (100:53 - 100:57)
and stuff (100:56 - 101:00)
but um it's still (100:57 - 101:03)
so time consuming (101:00 - 101:06)
not only on the playing but prepping a (101:03 - 101:07)
team so like right now i'm in a draft (101:06 - 101:08)
league (101:07 - 101:09)
uh with a bunch of other content (101:08 - 101:12)
creators that's on the youtube channel (101:09 - 101:15)
and i am sure most of those creators (101:12 - 101:19)
are using a discord bot or some sort of (101:15 - 101:22)
third-party software to generate their (101:19 - 101:22)
team (101:22 - 101:26)
to play in this match and whatever (101:22 - 101:28)
i get it because i'm doing it the (101:26 - 101:30)
quote-unquote legit way (101:28 - 101:33)
and it is incredibly time consuming in a (101:30 - 101:34)
week (101:33 - 101:37)
i have to look at their team i have to (101:34 - 101:39)
try to counter their team with the 10 (101:37 - 101:41)
pokemon i have pick six of them (101:39 - 101:43)
figure out how to counter their team (101:41 - 101:44)
come up with spreads (101:43 - 101:46)
specific eevee spreads come up with a (101:44 - 101:48)
move set and then practice that team in (101:46 - 101:49)
a week (101:48 - 101:51)
and because i'm building the team in (101:49 - 101:54)
game no shade to anyone who's not i get (101:51 - 101:56)
why they're not doing it (101:54 - 101:56)
it is so time consuming and resource (101:57 - 102:00)
heavy (102:00 - 102:03)
of like yes i have these 10 pokemon cool (102:00 - 102:04)
i got to spend (102:03 - 102:06)
all i got to spend my resources to reset (102:04 - 102:08)
their stats i got to spend my money to (102:06 - 102:09)
buy more vitamins (102:08 - 102:12)
i got to calculate out the vitamins oh (102:09 - 102:15)
kingdra needs an egg move uh (102:12 - 102:17)
okay does anyone like i am very (102:15 - 102:18)
fortunate i have a discord and a slack i (102:17 - 102:19)
can go (102:18 - 102:20)
hey does anyone have a kingdra with (102:19 - 102:22)
clear smog oh cool you have a horsey (102:20 - 102:23)
with clear smog (102:22 - 102:25)
well guess what it has to be a kingdra (102:23 - 102:26)
because i need to put kingdra and (102:25 - 102:27)
kingdra in (102:26 - 102:28)
i have to delete the move i have to then (102:27 - 102:30)
hope i have to then spin in a circle to (102:28 - 102:31)
that move (102:30 - 102:34)
it is so time like to build my team in (102:31 - 102:35)
game this week (102:34 - 102:39)
took two hours i like it was built in (102:35 - 102:40)
showdown or some third-party thing in (102:39 - 102:43)
seconds i mean obviously tweak and stuff (102:40 - 102:45)
uh but it took two hours to build this (102:43 - 102:46)
team to have (102:45 - 102:49)
a couple matches and now i have to do (102:46 - 102:50)
that again (102:49 - 102:52)
and that like that building team even (102:50 - 102:54)
though it's fast two hours is very fast (102:52 - 102:56)
to build six pokemon (102:54 - 102:59)
um that doesn't include the practicing (102:56 - 103:00)
that doesn't include making sure (102:59 - 103:02)
like i am lucky that i have so much (103:00 - 103:04)
money in sword and shield and i have so (103:02 - 103:04)
many (103:04 - 103:06)
resources and sword shield because i (103:04 - 103:08)
have a thousand hours in sword and (103:06 - 103:09)
shield so like (103:08 - 103:10)
probably at the end of this 11 week (103:09 - 103:13)
tournament i will be out of resources (103:10 - 103:17)
but i can't imagine an actual (103:13 - 103:18)
person who doesn't play pokemon full (103:17 - 103:21)
time that needs to have (103:18 - 103:24)
six fully eevee iv bread pokemon (103:21 - 103:26)
every single week for a tournament like (103:24 - 103:28)
that is unreal expectations (103:26 - 103:32)
and a lot without playing so much of the (103:28 - 103:33)
game (103:32 - 103:38)
i mean again if this is your game (103:33 - 103:40)
and that's what you want then you're (103:38 - 103:43)
going to put in the time just like (103:40 - 103:46)
there are people who all they do is pvp (103:43 - 103:49)
in final fantasy 14 and i've done it (103:46 - 103:50)
literally twice (103:49 - 103:53)
to get a reward that i wanted and then i (103:50 - 103:54)
left it behind (103:53 - 103:57)
because not only is it a completely (103:54 - 103:58)
different game (103:57 - 103:59)
the controls are different like (103:58 - 104:01)
everything about it is different (103:59 - 104:04)
and you have to make that choice and (104:01 - 104:07)
then decide this is what i want to do (104:04 - 104:10)
and that is always going to be a very (104:07 - 104:11)
small amount of people (104:10 - 104:14)
well and there's also a very key (104:11 - 104:16)
psychological thing which (104:14 - 104:17)
i think everybody is susceptible to (104:16 - 104:19)
because i even thinking about this greg (104:17 - 104:20)
and i (104:19 - 104:22)
fell into this earlier in recording (104:20 - 104:24)
today (104:22 - 104:28)
just because and a lot of competitive (104:24 - 104:29)
people think this (104:28 - 104:33)
just because you really enjoy something (104:29 - 104:35)
does not necessarily mean that you're (104:33 - 104:36)
going to convince (104:35 - 104:38)
somebody else that they're going to (104:36 - 104:40)
really enjoy that you know greg and i (104:38 - 104:43)
love to play magic commander we played (104:40 - 104:43)
last night (104:43 - 104:46)
had a great time when steve moves to (104:43 - 104:47)
minneapolis (104:46 - 104:50)
we may want him to play commander with (104:47 - 104:51)
us (104:50 - 104:54)
okay but that does not mean that he will (104:51 - 104:55)
enjoy it (104:54 - 104:56)
he may not but he can at least try it (104:55 - 104:58)
once with yeah (104:56 - 105:01)
okay but but there's also a lower (104:58 - 105:03)
barriers entry there's a lower barrier (105:01 - 105:06)
competitive pokemon shield has done a (105:03 - 105:06)
very (105:06 - 105:07)
so here's the one thing about (105:06 - 105:10)
competitors right sword and shield or (105:07 - 105:11)
past pokemon games have done such a good (105:10 - 105:14)
job and this is just the nature of (105:11 - 105:17)
people playing through a pokemon game if (105:14 - 105:18)
you've played through (105:17 - 105:20)
any pokemon game whether that's red and (105:18 - 105:22)
blue let's go pikachu let's go eevee (105:20 - 105:25)
sun and moon you can watch a battle and (105:22 - 105:26)
understand it (105:25 - 105:28)
i don't have to like i could play little (105:26 - 105:29)
league football and watch nfl and (105:28 - 105:32)
understand (105:29 - 105:34)
okay they get the ball to the other end (105:32 - 105:36)
they're kicking they're throwing like (105:34 - 105:39)
like football soccer baseball (105:36 - 105:42)
you can watch it never play those actual (105:39 - 105:45)
sports irl and understand it and (105:42 - 105:46)
unlike the pokemon trading card game (105:45 - 105:48)
which is very hard to watch (105:46 - 105:51)
uh and follow the it's very easy to (105:48 - 105:52)
watch (105:51 - 105:53)
four pokemon on the field that one's (105:52 - 105:55)
water that one's fire (105:53 - 105:57)
that one's grass this one got real big (105:55 - 105:58)
did their water type move (105:57 - 106:01)
to the fire one the fire one died like (105:58 - 106:02)
it's very easy (106:01 - 106:04)
for somebody to watch and enjoy and (106:02 - 106:06)
understand the competitive battle (106:04 - 106:08)
so if anything the pokemon company has (106:06 - 106:09)
done a really good job (106:08 - 106:12)
at that whether that was intentional or (106:09 - 106:13)
not (106:12 - 106:15)
i think they also added in that you can (106:13 - 106:16)
rent teams (106:15 - 106:19)
like you can can't you still qr code (106:16 - 106:21)
somebody's team and test it out and see (106:19 - 106:22)
if you like it (106:21 - 106:25)
yeah so there is (106:22 - 106:28)
i think at this point up a very low (106:25 - 106:29)
barrier of entry to try (106:28 - 106:31)
if you like vgc like you can find (106:29 - 106:32)
somebody's team that you (106:31 - 106:34)
yes they say is very good and you can (106:32 - 106:37)
try it out that doesn't mean that you (106:34 - 106:37)
are going to (106:37 - 106:42)
like playing against another person (106:37 - 106:44)
because it is vastly different than (106:42 - 106:45)
playing against the computer (106:44 - 106:47)
all right we failed at lightning round (106:45 - 106:49)
here folks yeah (106:47 - 106:51)
so we are so long into this episode (106:49 - 106:53)
let's go to pokemon of the week (106:51 - 106:56)
i just want to say that like two quick (106:53 - 106:57)
things number one (106:56 - 106:59)
is what you guys commented on earlier (106:57 - 107:00)
it's very hard for somebody to get into (106:59 - 107:02)
competitive because they do want to use (107:00 - 107:03)
their favorite pokemon (107:02 - 107:06)
and so what will normally happen is that (107:03 - 107:06)
somebody will (107:06 - 107:08)
will they'll do the research they'll (107:06 - 107:10)
look up the evs they'll look up the best (107:08 - 107:12)
move sets they'll look at the meta they (107:10 - 107:14)
will they will spend (107:12 - 107:17)
weeks or hours or months (107:14 - 107:19)
whatever i should have said hours weeks (107:17 - 107:21)
months building a team of their favorite (107:19 - 107:22)
pokemon (107:21 - 107:24)
and then go into a battle and instantly (107:22 - 107:25)
lose and that makes them (107:24 - 107:28)
feel like the worst ever because of how (107:25 - 107:30)
much time they put in (107:28 - 107:34)
um but not understanding that like (107:30 - 107:36)
just because there's such a big (107:34 - 107:37)
disconnect between like (107:36 - 107:39)
building a team and battling and i have (107:37 - 107:41)
to explain this to people on twitch all (107:39 - 107:43)
the time where they're like (107:41 - 107:47)
uh like just because you built your team (107:43 - 107:48)
doesn't mean you're a good battler and (107:47 - 107:49)
just because you're a good battler (107:48 - 107:51)
doesn't mean you can suddenly build a (107:49 - 107:52)
team right like (107:51 - 107:55)
those are two different skill sets uh (107:52 - 107:57)
completely they just don't they just (107:55 - 107:59)
don't relate to each other at all (107:57 - 108:02)
like you can be the best battler and not (107:59 - 108:03)
know how (108:02 - 108:06)
to build the team or vice versa so (108:03 - 108:07)
that's a problem (108:06 - 108:09)
and the other problem um that i want to (108:07 - 108:11)
mention that like they said that is it (108:09 - 108:13)
reality that's just cold hard fact that (108:11 - 108:14)
you have a large audience is why is (108:13 - 108:15)
pokemon (108:14 - 108:17)
and the minority gets into it we've seen (108:15 - 108:18)
this (108:17 - 108:20)
yes we've seen this like case in point (108:18 - 108:21)
with with (108:20 - 108:24)
like r slash pokemon where when they (108:21 - 108:25)
show dreadnought for the first time in (108:24 - 108:27)
sword and shield i'll never forget this (108:25 - 108:27)
moment (108:27 - 108:28)
they showed dreadnought and they showed (108:27 - 108:30)
dreadnought gigantomaxing and they (108:28 - 108:32)
showed dreadnought's signature move (108:30 - 108:33)
which was stone surge (108:32 - 108:35)
which was a water type move that set up (108:33 - 108:37)
stealth rock and that was (108:35 - 108:39)
the most upvoted post on our slash (108:37 - 108:41)
pokemon for like the week (108:39 - 108:43)
is like game freak doesn't understand (108:41 - 108:45)
competitive because they just gave this (108:43 - 108:48)
pokemon a gigantomax move and it sets up (108:45 - 108:51)
it sets up um stealth rock when in (108:48 - 108:54)
reality the actual competitive people (108:51 - 108:56)
that understand this game in and out (108:54 - 108:57)
went (108:56 - 109:00)
this pokemon is useless uh stealth (108:57 - 109:02)
rockin doubles battles is useless (109:00 - 109:06)
but the vocal majority (109:02 - 109:08)
who doesn't understand competitive but (109:06 - 109:09)
thinks they understand competitive and (109:08 - 109:09)
this was (109:09 - 109:11)
this is what i thought i understood when (109:09 - 109:13)
i started this podcast i thought i would (109:11 - 109:14)
have probably been that person being (109:13 - 109:14)
like (109:14 - 109:17)
oh yeah gigantomax dreadnought is going (109:14 - 109:18)
to ruin the meta (109:17 - 109:20)
no one has ever used dreadnought (109:18 - 109:21)
competitively because it's just a bad (109:20 - 109:23)
pokemon and like (109:21 - 109:26)
the perception of people thinking they (109:23 - 109:27)
know competitive (109:26 - 109:29)
because they've watched stuff or they've (109:27 - 109:30)
played through the game or they've (109:29 - 109:32)
dabbled in battle tower (109:30 - 109:34)
versus the actual reality of making it (109:32 - 109:36)
to a player's cup or (109:34 - 109:38)
playing at a high level there's a huge (109:36 - 109:40)
disconnect and there's like (109:38 - 109:43)
there's like no way of getting those (109:40 - 109:44)
people to realize that until they (109:43 - 109:47)
seriously get into competitive battling (109:44 - 109:48)
and realize like (109:47 - 109:51)
oh yeah stealth rock is kind of bad in (109:48 - 109:52)
doubles (109:51 - 109:55)
yeah yep i mean i will say this (109:52 - 109:58)
i play a lot of pokemon i i build teams (109:55 - 110:00)
because they build them for fun (109:58 - 110:02)
when we even when we did fun tournaments (110:00 - 110:04)
in slack (110:02 - 110:07)
the amount of stress i feel (110:04 - 110:10)
playing against another person (110:07 - 110:14)
makes it not fun for me i get very (110:10 - 110:17)
stressed out about it um (110:14 - 110:20)
and so there are people like me that (110:17 - 110:21)
just (110:20 - 110:24)
playing against another human being is (110:21 - 110:25)
not (110:24 - 110:28)
what i'm in my games for i want it to be (110:25 - 110:29)
cooperative (110:28 - 110:31)
and we're going to play with somebody (110:29 - 110:33)
else (110:31 - 110:33)

uh friendship evolution (111:29 - 111:32)

flying watermelon (111:52 - 111:55)

imagine a flying watermelon that's (111:55 - 111:59)
that's what you're gonna get (111:57 - 112:02)

it is a and they've never brought the (112:27 - 112:32)
tongue back bring back the tongue (112:30 - 112:35)
more well you know the bigger thing than (112:32 - 112:36)
national decks is that (112:35 - 112:40)
bring back is not oriented (112:36 - 112:44)
properly it's like attached (112:40 - 112:45)
it doesn't need to make sense wait there (112:44 - 112:47)
was a tongue in (112:45 - 112:51)
ruby and sapphire (112:47 - 112:53)
in that in that mouth that's not a (112:51 - 112:55)
shadow that's a tongue in there (112:53 - 112:58)
yeah maybe maybe what about next year (112:55 - 113:00)

uh the according to bulbapedia the only (113:10 - 113:15)
core series games to depict its tongue (113:13 - 113:18)
were pokemon red and blue and the last (113:15 - 113:20)
game to ever depict its tongue (113:18 - 113:24)

this week's pokemon for you all we're (113:29 - 113:35)
we're raising the level again i'm trying (113:33 - 113:37)
to have faith in my kids (113:35 - 113:40)
that you'll be able to sort this one out (113:37 - 113:43)
outside of type there are other factors (113:40 - 113:44)
of a pokemon (113:43 - 113:47)
that can impact how a particular pokemon (113:44 - 113:49)
interacts with game mechanics (113:47 - 113:52)
there is only one pokemon because of a (113:49 - 113:53)
certain factor (113:52 - 113:56)
that when attacked by low kick or (113:53 - 113:59)
grass knot the attack's power is (113:56 - 114:03)
80. receive a minus 20 (113:59 - 114:06)
modifier when trying to be caught in a (114:03 - 114:07)
heavy ball (114:06 - 114:10)
are not eligible to compete in the fancy (114:07 - 114:11)
cup (114:10 - 114:14)
