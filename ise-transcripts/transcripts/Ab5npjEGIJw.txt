[Music] so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 400 and episode was that correct that's correct we got there yes of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm i literally looked at our ad copy for the week which said what episode it was ruined it because the premium people aren't even supposed to know that ads exist and now you've let them behind them bummer uh i'm your host spj with me is greg hello i am back from my wildlife rescue morning we found a poor injured baby bunny in our yard last night and we're like oh well we'll do the thing where you leave it overnight because maybe the mom will come mom didn't come so we scooped up bunny and went to the wildlife rehabilitation center this morning and dropped a little bun off to get it get get all fixed forest you live in that was like three months ago you're like i got this rat that we took out to the jesus or something i've got like eight bunny rabbits in my backyard i took i took a rat to jesus that's exactly what happened when i went to my pokemon snap look i i i live in a green city i have a yard and we have bunnies and we're pretty sure that wherever the bunny home was one of the many feral cats in our neighborhood decided to do a midnight raid and they all fleed because our little bun was clearly clearly had been bit by something and pretty sure it wasn't our dogs um because they're they they don't like it when they scream back the animals supposed to just roll over and be cute but it yelled and then they were like what what no well also here i had the pleasure of having dinner last night with not only internet's pokemon favorite greg leatherman but spotify recording artist nicholas burgess indeed and their appropriate spouses as assigned last night i like that nick guy yes we also had brazilian themed ice cream or we did iced a i iced dessert because it wasn't all cream because mine was coconut ice based dessert it was it was presented as ice cream but had more things in it and i had a lemon party in my mouth i was going to say something about late 90s early 2000s internet culture and what greg ate but it is no longer appropriate for this podcast because he gave the name we have coconut madonna or whatever i had a coconut caipirinha caipirinha is a very traditional brazilian drink made with lime and cachaca i waited over an hour for a hot dog i saw that on the internet and no nick burgess will anderson or greg leatherman no no i had the the best part was i had to wait by myself cause irene was like my hair is melting in the sun i'm gonna go wait in the shade and i was like sounds like irene i mean it was hot years we did look all right people if only irene would choose non-butter themed hair styles she wouldn't melt so much i am the number one minnesota tourist i did to her giver not to her wrist tour giver to her guide i did 10 hours of showing the wonders of minnesota to nick i took him shopping we went and saw the marilyn tyler moore house we went and saw the defunct locks on the river i did it all i walked around downtown minnesota and played pokemon go with no tour guide and it was i tried i had to work no no did you see the mary tyler moore statue no i saw um then you've never visited minnesota a lot of construction yeah well and a lot of one ways yeah well downtown is on a grid and the grids are driven by the runways milwaukee has a couple one ways downtown not a lot couple anyways we got way too much talk about the show to talk about traffic ice cream and nick burgess we had to get all the stuff that people are interested in out of the way at the start of the show right so they go oh they're talking about unite skip to the end that's true dessert get the secret word look we got we got slimed we got time stamps i spent a lot of time making sure our time stamps are up today for podcast listeners i'm glad you used those for the two people you gotta do chapters you gotta do chapters uh i don't know how to do chapters get good okay we got unite it came out it's here uh we're gonna talk about whether it's pay to win we're gonna talk about whether it's fun we're gonna talk about whether will already gave up on it when we're gonna talk about uh voice chat look it came up in chat last night well which chat twitter twitch chat they saw that you love people they signed off the slack channel of unite so they're like oh will must be over here but let's get there look at that i want to say he also left the pet channel on i'm pretty sure he's not over pets i mean this one yeah yes i am it just cost me 1800 i'm over it over it okay well let's let's kick off the podcast with a little fun a little summer fun gloria and italian and marnie and grimsnarl are on pokemon masters we didn't talk about this last week because it was uh pre-recorded um the two gala region sick pears are here to see the best restaurant in beachside rival there's a new story event it's called beachside rivalry look none of this matters the only thing that matters is they add my boy grimsnyr all to the game and i love grim snarl uh i don't really needed marnie to be in a swimsuit to have grimstar but in a swimsuit it is a it is a pleasant top and a skirt bottom they're like swimsuit beachy theme do you wear it with a beach theme but i mean i would not swim in that outfit you get dragged under no one's actually swimming when they go to the beach they're laying in the sand you get too hot you know you get rip-tide and then you're gone forever you can't trust that water it pulls you right under and you're gone this spoken by person who can't swim and thus has never swung things like that yeah it's not an ocean but not all oceans have riptides this is not how logic works yeah well there are pokemon who have attacks underneath it they're gonna drag you in take it did you pull on these greg uh i only pulled on marnie cause the two year is coming up so i wanted to save my gems oh that makes sense that makes sense yeah i didn't really spend any gems for most of june and july i was gonna pull on mass royale and then that came and went because yep i've been busy so at least i've been collecting my gems and i was gonna pull on ingo and emmett and that came and went and hey i got i got lots of gems i'm sitting on so sometime this week i'm gonna pull on marnie for sure just marnie i don't really care too much about gloria i just want grim snarl and i do want both look i want both that's the reality the reality is though that the two year anniversary is coming up i haven't saved gems i need to save jim sue uh i did get the grim snarl oh you did yeah first one i said i'm both it's dark first though oh okay i thought masters only has one type no it has the two now because it shows the dark and then the the fairy because it it will count if it's got moves of that type oh okay i missed something then uh there's also a fossil event happening in masters and that ties into other fossil events and other games and we'll circle back to that i want to get the you know i wanted to get the masters news out of the way at first because you questioned my you questioned me and i have to see yeah you can double check uh okay let's talk about pokemon unite uh we'll just get right into it i just wanted to get the masters out of the way this is off uh unite.pokemon.com unite is now available on the nintendo switch uh it says that yeah it's dark fairy uh the game is available for the nintendo e on the nintendo eshop for no cost if you download it by august 31st you will receive zera auras unite license to help on your quest for victory by battling in the first season of unite you will find essential items that will help you achieve success in future battles battling frequently will also raise your battle pass level which they say here but they don't really explain very well in the game uh which is another way to obtain new items when you upgrade your battle pass you will receive additional rare items like a rare hollow ware that would be for cinderella so it's i think it goes up to 90 the battle pass uh unite will be available on mobile this is the question i got the most this week is when's it coming to mobile in september cross play between the nintendo switch and the smartphone this is i'm gonna read this sentence you take for what it's worth cross play between the nintendo switch and smartphone is planned which will allow players on both platforms to battle against each one another additionally if you log in using your nintendo account or your trainer club account you will be see you will be able to see your game data on any device that was another question uh so if you put a bunch of money into the switch version do you have to start over on the ipad version doesn't seem like it uh with this feature you can play on your hall you can play at home using your tv and the nintendo switch on the go using your mobile version or i don't know you just take your switch with you i guess but i guess you would need internet for that and the game is out so before we talk about the money or the battle pass or and that stuff let's talk about the game itself uh this is the first moba i've played although i've watched people play mobas that's not true i played like 10 minutes of heroes of the storm um i've watched people play moba so i always understood the gist of it uh and my biggest concern was would i like imoba i uh 40 hours in i still can't answer that question i think 40 hours in the answer is you like more aspects of mobas than you hate here's i think the answer is yes i love the game and yes i understand why people who play mobas hate their lives i think that is the answer like i now and i understand very quickly the toxicity that exists in mobas and why people are always frustrated i guess you can apply that to like team games in general and i think back in all the raids i did in destiny which was like a six person thing and then one person kept messing up their specific role that person potentially your spouse no yes sometimes but no other times i mean the difference is that when irene was doing bad we would put her in a position where it would minimize impact true true i mean the same thing happens in rating and final fantasy 14 like you need people to know what they're doing if that person is not able to do that i mean you're like get it together well the thing i've noticed too and i would always say it vocally on stream is like oh i bet i lost this mat i i bet i'm the reason this match lost and sometimes you have a bad game sometimes like you know when i'm in top lane and that player is just better than me it's like i'm i'm not i'm not sure what to do like do i move to a different lane like do i just suffer like i don't know that high-end part of being like this person is clearly outclassing me and i'm not good enough to compete with them and now i'm the reason the team lost but i'm at least self-aware that like oh it's my it's my uh it was me maybe it was me i was the reason we lost i mean i'm support so i am where i i support but like if somebody can clearly do better than then you literally switch to supporting them right like you attack the things that are in their way you you switch your mode to being like i am not the scorer here but i am going to help assist and when there's not something that they're actually doing i am going to kill the wild pokemon around me so that when we do do a big push and i assist them to clear the way i can make my tiny score but like a person's way better than you like switch to support but i mean i am a support player like that that is my happy place right now is playing elder goss and healing people and you guys are talking about playing without being able to talk to the other people on your team right yes there's a differentiation there because i've primarily only played with people i was talking to and coordinating with so i wanted so i i play a lot of ranked stuff me too um like i play i play ranked apex legends and the the reason i play ranked over duos or triples sorry is you get penalized if you dropped in rank so what happens normally in like the free play is people have like less of a commitment so like they'll die and instead of like them waiting for you to revive them they just leave the game and move on and it's that's really frustrating so in ranked there's like that commitment of well you can't leave because you'll get a 10 minute penalty and then you can't even play the game for 10 minutes and i personally like even though i know ranked is like more sweaty in most games i like having a visual of how i'm doing like i'm going from silver to bronze to silver to silver to gold and then that's where i usually end up at apex at the end of the season is i don't have a lot of time to play maybe i could push to whatever comes after platinum um but i like knowing where i am and i don't get that feedback in like pickup play or just casuals um and i don't know it kind of feels weird like i guess you can still win but at least in like something like final fantasy 14 or destiny like there's an end point right like you beat the raid yeah you're good to go um or do it again next week because you need yeah or something like destiny with iron banner which wasn't really ranked but it was more like we're doing this to get certain rewards yeah um so when i did ranked and unite i wanted to do it solo because i normally solo apex as well because i i want to know like my skill set and i didn't want to like be carried by because for every time somebody says like oh my team was bad that's why i lost you could ease no and no one ever does this but you could easily make the argument of like oh everyone else was good and i was bad but we won because of them right like even though you get worse people you will get better people yeah uh and i was able to make it to expert which greg also made it to expert um solo queue and i was like really proud of that because it wasn't like oh i'm clearly the worst out of my four friends and like the reason i got to expert was because of them i wanted to be like well the reason i got to expert was because i because me we had good games last night though yeah that was the first time uh i played with a real human on ranked with greg and and twitch got to see my great support skills my clutch plays what was funny is because there's a delay i would do things and have moved past and then i wouldn't hear you talk about that i'm like oh that was five minutes ago focus what are you doing steve focus that was five minutes wait that's because you're delayed [Laughter] uh well what is your overall thoughts on the game i mean i've been playing a lot of it i i tried to look up and see how much time i've put into it but i can't i just it's not enough yet that this week it's like something after like a week it'll show you something yeah uh i mean i enjoy it i originally wanted to main one character and that was not working out for me so i switched to a support character but i pretty much have only played with like my friends who are with either on a discord call or in person so we coordinate that way and uh most of my friends are very experienced in mobas and have a lot so they're kind of like just telling me how to how to go through it and and what to do i mean we're not perfect but uh i've been having a lot of fun i think it's just it's it's fun to sit down because it's ten minutes right yeah like if we have a half an hour to kill we can do three rounds three matches and and walk away i don't like talonflame no i like talonflame i talonflame is not i'm not at a level where i can play talon and flame well as opposed to what i now play which is snorlax which i have been able to get mvp playing snorlax oh we have to we all know that getting mvp is all that matters we need to play together because we so we did a friendly match against steve uh where one of his uh members in chat and i just was snorlax and el degas at the lower lane and nobody could get past us we just we just kept everybody at me and everyone as well seems like i haven't seen craig this entire game i'm like yeah because you're not coming down to death alley where we are murdering or murdering everybody uh because you fools are gonna come and try to take us down and you can't now i think our best combo was uh snorlax and alolan ninetales that is that is an outstanding when i i do play alolan nine tails uh as a more support role and like the reach and slow down of alolan nine tails compared to the i'm not gonna jump in and wreck house that starlax does is an amazing combo um and greg your overall thoughts before you move on to character roster and stuff people think have asked me the question like oh do you like the game and my response is i paid money i gave them money no you did well we have to get to the moment okay wait wait wait wait so i have a quick this this was a discussion i had with one of my friends and i'm pretty certain i can predict the outcome of what how you guys would react so my friend was playing and looked at the roster of pokemon and was like oh geez all of these pokemon are so expensive to earn from points in the game okay and i said well you're gonna be playing this game a lot anyways you love mobas now my prediction is greg will understand what i was saying what i meant and steve will take it as my friend took it so let's go with steve first steve how do you react to well you're going to be playing it a lot you love mobas you're going to be putting a lot of time into this game i would take it as like yeah unlock one character a week it's fine and greg yeah like you're gonna get the okay so you both agree with each other that was i meant you will earn points yeah you will get those he took it as if you're going to love this game so much throw money at it right now because you want to unlock all the books and i was like no no i looked up that looked up at the tv and he's putting his credit card in and i was like i didn't mean spend money i meant you're going to earn the characters yeah you're going to earn the characters over time plus there's like so i will say this the very first day i was playing i'm like oh i'm going to buy a little nine tails and then it looks right it's like no i get a little details for free tomorrow yeah i am not gonna buy this uh overall i do really i really do enjoy the game um i get frustrated that people don't yet understand what they're supposed to do in the game like if i am playing el degas and you all leave me alone i'm not doing my like you've all left there's nobody for me to support i can't i can keep things at bay for a while but they're gonna see that i'm alone and they're gonna swap me and there's nothing i can do about it because i am alone and a support character and so let me explain is that right it came up that i left the pokemon unite channel in slack and there's a very particular reason why i did that that's an overall also response to kind of like the first week of the game um i've been playing with players who play a lot of mobas who understand what the different lanes mean who should be in what lane they've already started doing configurations of this is the best build out for this pokemon for this lane etc etc i also am the kind of person who if i see an unread channel in slack cannot ignore it and and compelled to go in and look and there's just so many folks in there who don't have moba experience and also like overall like people playing unite right now who don't have moba experience that i just got tired of seeing the i don't know what this means i don't know what that means this and like the old repeated explanations and i was like i'll come back at some point when it's just the people who want to talk more key strategy and detail i i don't think that's a bad thing though people like the game did what it was supposed to do which is get people into the series they have played yes uh i mean i i am surprised at like i have been up till 1am since it's come out playing matches because it's always like well just one match and i gotta push their ranks i met great four and then i would get a team where i'm like okay you've knocked me down now i have to now i have to go in because you all left me uh and ultimately like like playing with drew realized like drew drew truly is a nine tails main the things that drew can do with nine tails because drew has a much more aggressive play style and i'm like i like support i like seeing the situation and responding to it not i have to push to get goals so like i'm decided to focus on elder goss because i really a i don't find it stressful like most pvp games i'm always stressed out and that stops me from playing in here one we'll talk about this later but like there's not there's not a voice chat unless i choose to and i'm gonna choose to do it with my friends so that's already gonna be a different experience two i feel like it's just ten minutes worth of time people are still figuring out the game uh my frustration levels are probably with them figuring out how to play the game and not necessarily that they were bad or that i was super bad like it's been five days at most now and i everybody's figuring it out and it it plays in a very different way there are things i don't like about the game like there comes a certain point where you just can't catch up no matter what like also if it's internet and if one person just does like accepts and picks the character but then can't connect and they just sit back in base a four versus five is almost impossible to come back from yeah and there are there are things like the game doesn't register that one person is gone and doesn't like have a way to correct for that yet so that it is just kind of done you can report them yes if a person is gone i don't know how long it is it will replace it with a bot and then you yeah you can tell the bot to be like top lane or bottom line yeah i mean we finally in one game got the bot a minute before the match was over and it's like okay well we have been wrecked this entire time yeah i mean there's there there needs to be a thing like in i think call of duty and apex both do this but if you're in ranked and you drop you should be penalized 10 15 minutes of not being able to play i mean and i do know that they have a good sportsmanship meter in the game i don't fully know what affects that but i didn't expect to like this game as much as i did and especially on the first day well i'm like yep i'm giving this money like i'm already i've already gotten 20 worth of fun out of this game so yeah i'll i'll pay and have gems i'm not buying characters i'm not buying clothes i just bought the extra battle pass there's not um just a heads up there's like not a big downside to buying characters if you bought nine tails and then nine tails like was the free thing it actually gives you like a bunch of coins because it acknowledges that you bought it so it's not like i get it like some people like there's a lot of people that are playing syndras but cinderace is the 14 yeah sorry no sid race is the seven day free pokemon and then greninja is the 14 day free pokemon so like i get it i mean if cinderella is your favorite pokemon and you don't you don't want to wait a full week i and i said this with cram like i was like i'm sure cram is pay paid i'm sure i could you know earn enough currency to unlock him but i i want to play my favorite character my favorite pokemon right away because wait look favorite pokemon don't win games dude yeah you're off the team you're off the team because that's how will not against the world now i mean i guess the the other way is like oh just play it and don't worry about unlocking the character maybe you won't like it but it's like what if i do like it yeah and you missed all that time fomo crammer city for things like crema where the gameplay is really difficult like what kramer ant does is very situational and you really have to understand how to use those like they aren't kidding when it's like expert characters like you have to understand what these things do and why you would use them the other thing i don't like about unite is once you pick your moves if you find out that other people aren't like going that route there's not a way to say like okay we'll switch me over from pollen puff to leaf tornado like i can't undo the choice that i made or at least i don't know how to yeah um because like i'm realizing they aren't playing in a style that supports a pollen puff play style i need leaf tornado to be able to stand on my own but i already made that choice and i can't i don't know how if you can i don't think you can switch it to the other thing so i'm stuck with a sub-optimal choice based off of the situation i'm in i don't have a way to change it yeah the thing that i feel like helps as the character you're playing so like i think i have a pretty good understanding of cram because i've been playing them non-stop and not a lot of people are playing them because they probably use their coins unlike something else or don't have enough coins it's a hard character to play uh but the other thing that i feel like maybe people don't think about and here's maybe a little bit of advice is like understand what your character does against other characters like when the first time i saw mr mime which was like maybe like it was like literally maybe eight hours in until i saw my first mr mime i was like i have no clue what this dude does am i supposed to like rush him am i supposed to like keep my distance like how much health does he have um the same with uh like cinderace like the first time i saw the first couple times i saw cinderella i was just roasting cinderella's like just plumbing through him and then i found like the next day like oh this cinderace person is destroying me yeah so it's like was the first day of cinder race just so bad and then the like second day people figured it out so i feel like playing the character even though you're like i know like when i played when i first started playing cinderella's i was like well i should play it so i understand what they do and i was like okay i get it now but also i don't like playing sid race but it's still a really good understanding when you're going against the cinder ace or any other pokemon to be like okay this is what it does i still don't know what wigglytuff does i've seen like four wiggly tuffs and i know it double slaps and i know it puts you to sleep i don't know what its other moves are but every time it shows up it's real annoying cannot wrap my head around how gengar works when i'm facing what i'm like where did you come from how are you here what am i supposed to do everybody left me please is eating me alive yeah or you see jager come out of nowhere and you're like how are you already level 10 everyone else is level five where did where did you come from can i can i do a psa on this particular thing yes this issue okay so as far as i understand please tell me if i'm completely wrong you level up as you collect eos energy in the field is it time based no it's by knocking out the minions yeah okay okay same thing in my opinion you knock out minions to collect eos energy so oh yeah you just don't have to pick up the energy right okay we we all start at the base together we run out into the field right if you see me go after apom number one you keep going do not steal my apom by because only the person who gets the last hit gets credit for taking out when it comes to leveling up no no you get you you get the energy the last hit gets the energy whoever's attacking it still gets experience yeah do you get enough experience so that i'm not sure of this so you so the person the main person gets i think a little bit more experience and the assist gets less but just like get get your own creeps folks but you don't need to take here's here's the thing i'm using the xp share item so i don't get experience for assisting i have to help you kill things so you level up faster so my xp share item goes off and starts auto leveling me so i'm always falling behind and hitting a couple of things while i'm letting the person i'm following kill things so it frustrates me like steve would run past the thing that we're killing i'm like no you have to kill this i didn't realize you were running xp until i saw like i was literally 40 hours in the game and i never saw a light bulb above somebody's head yeah and then you had the light bulb and i was like am i missing something i've seen out the gas before i've never seen this light bulb yeah so the other thing too though is there are faster characters and slower characters if you are playing a faster character run past the first two apom and get the two go towards the two that are standing like there's two like yeah oh i always do those two because i have a aoe and i hit both of them at the same time well there that's that's fine but you don't like everybody doesn't have to stop at the first a palm right and not with that attitude yeah the team game we're all gonna team up go on your own get into the middle there's all sorts of things in there that you can kill fast and level up 30 hours in i didn't realize there's like a single lilly pup that spawns yeah but it's only worth it i know but i would always run past like i would always run straight up to get those a palms and then somebody was like oh lily pup and i was like there's a little lily pop then you need to go around the wall to get you yeah yeah yeah around the wall does it turn into stoutland i have only seen it turned into hertier i've never seen it evolve i've seen but i've never seen the stoutland i don't know what required what makes that what level has to happen to make them evolve like i don't understand how they level up throughout the game i just time i think it's just time yeah but um let me revise my statement then if you are playing a support character let your dps or your main chara dude who's doing all the work hard fast kill whatever get get the eos energy yeah because you don't need snorlax taking a nap on the other team's goal to pop out some energy it's always really cute uh all right let's take a break when we come back we're going to talk about the battle pass and the money um and the characters because i'm sure there are very few people that have every character unlocked at this point unless you spent a lot of money i didn't so uh we will be right back [Music] [Music] yes [Music] dynamics a dynamax band and we are back from our break all right there's a whole roster of characters i'm just going to run them down real quick just so we don't forget anyone in this conversation we got pikachu slobro charizard absol snorlax machamp crustal wigglytuff greninja alolan ninetales elder goss kramer ant talonflame gengar lucario garchomp venusaur cinderace mr mime and zeraora so there are 20 characters all together we know two more characters are coming blastoise and gardevoir and then a mystery character the game it's not surprising but the game doesn't give you a lot of characters off the bat which yeah was not last maybe it was last week but the week before where i was like i'm pretty sure cram's gonna be paid and i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure a lot of characters are going to be paid but i didn't think they were only going to give you like four out of 20. i mean they're getting like what is it you get you got a one nine tails after three days you're getting crustal after six days you get a little nine tails the second day oh second day it's literally like the next day like if you're gonna stick with this game and you want to see this character like play it for a day and then the alolan night tails blocks um and they do that they do a kind of okay thing where they like give you two characters to pick from it's like i think it's like snorlax or el degas or it's like pikachu and slow bro i think or something like that i i didn't they give you like all five to choose from four no no they only give you four because you can't go into ranked until you have five so you either have to wait to unlock a fifth one which would be the next day with nine tails i thought they gave you five to choose it could be four because i think it was i think it was for me it was pikachu el degas snorlax isn't the same with elder goss and slow bro yeah cause i definitely picked slo-bro oh weird because i saw talonflame i i didn't even notice any of the other ones because i was like obviously i'm picking talent lane uh and then i did the math um so i i based the math off the 40 gem purchase so that's this let's talk about some of the problems of the game okay the first problem is their currency is so obscure to make you not realize how much money you spend and i just want to shout out pokemon go one coin is one penny it is very easy to know like a rocket radar is two bucks a a poffin is a dollar a raid pass a dollar it is nice it is it is it is very simple it's not predatory in any way so in unite it is forty dollars actually let's go up to the fifty dollars because fifty is half of a hundred easy right fifty dollars is three thousand five 500 gems so it's less gems than money which look i'm partnered with dna dna has been very nice to me their gem system also slightly obscure in that sense uh because it's like 99 cents for it's whatever their gem system is no better than this but it makes it it makes it confusing on purpose so you don't know how much money you're spending so there's um so characters end up being at least based on my math about seven dollars and fifty cents uh which is pretty equivalent to apex legends so apex legends has it where you can buy loot boxes they're a dollar they're 99 cents or 100 coins or whatever and then they have their characters so you can either buy it with the in-game current the the you can either buy it with this red currency that you earn just by playing matches or you can just pay real money which is around the seven dollar mark but then apex legends has um skins for guns and then skins for characters and like the premium the good stuff would be like twenty dollars of skin which i have always i've said on the show many times i think that's way too much for our skin i was told by my twitch chat that in fortnite skins are about ten dollars but a yen apex this kids these days have way too much money so the so the the the problem or not the problem but the the cramer ant skin for your character the the raincoat the raincoat is almost 20 because it's like 1300 gems and if you just look at the bonus gem okay so i there's the first time gem bonus that i can't really see anymore so i i've spent 20 in the game i did the first time gem bonus 20 which was 1200 plus 1200. um and once you do that once it's then 1200 plus 130. um and then they they they have first time gem bonus so it's 60 plus 60 99 cents 245 245 4. 490 490 eight dollars and then the the 12 20 12 20 20 so i did the 12 20 plus 12 20. that was how much i gave the game you can just because that was another question you can do all four um first time gem bonuses it's not it's not like if you pick one it locks you out of the other you can do all four but the kramer ant skin was oh yeah the cr here's another okay so they purposely do this it's really manipulat manipulative if let's say the first time bonus didn't exist so a it's 12 20 plus 130 right which is 13.50 for 20. the cramer ant skin is thirteen seventy if that bonus didn't exist and you spent twenty dollars you are twenty gems short of being able to buy the cramer ant skin you would have to either go up or do you have to make another purchase this is you know the uh card fight vanguard gotcha game does something very similar where you can buy gems that you can use to do pulls to get cards in the game but let's say you it's like ten dollars for a thousand gems you put in ten dollars you get 750 of the good gems for pulls and then 250 of the not as good gems and i'm like but i put in 10 of all cash there's a bunch that do like that um i also want to point out like outfits so i always try to compare it to final fantasy 14 so buying a full outfit in final fantasy 14 is 18 oh can we get even like currency complaints if this is our current arena the there is a talonflame outfit with a little pilot goggles and scarf which i absolutely have to have that is available as a reward from the energy canister which of course is only random drops yeah unless you pay for the energy tank yeah i the so the the costumes are different um the i and they don't do they don't do a super good job at like signifying that to a player who maybe hasn't played a cosmetic based game so like in apex i'm sorry apex is gonna be the game i compare to the most um in apex there's there's like blue purple and then gold for like the stuff you can and then there's like gray but gray is like the default so the the the blue you can still pay for you can you can pay real money or you can pay your blue currency that you earn crafting materials to unlock blue outfits and then purple outfits are like better designed i guess and they're more money and they're more currency and then the the gold outfits are like the outfits that like change the whole appearance they look really cool um and those are those are the 20 ones and the talonflame and the cinderace are comparable to the 20 ones because not only do they change the cinderace and the talonflame but they changed the pre-evolution pokemon before that too so like score like um fletching fletching where will have like little goggles on his head and then when he evolves into fletching dirt um the scarf shows up and stuff like each level of that whereas um what is a pokemon machamp machamp has the beach uh floaty around him or whatever and he's got a lay too yeah he has the lay but the machop and the machoke don't have anything at all yeah which i find super frustrating so it is literally the equivalent of like a legendary skin first like an epic skin but they they don't actually signify that besides just like price i don't necessarily have a problem with like like these super rare because like the the talonflame and the cinderace also have like a cutscene i don't know if you've saw that it has like this cutscene that happens um when you like hover over the skin it's really cool if you go into the store and or if you go into just like the character roster and you can flip between skins if you just hover above talonflame and cinderease's skin like you'll see cinderella's like swoop in on a ship and he'll like run around and it's like really awesome it's like a really good piece of animation talonflame has this too but then talonflame incinerates also unlock you a frame that you can like put and this is a thing that apex does too with like their heirlooms which are their super super rare thing i think an heirloom out of a loot box is one in 300 but it's really exciting because it gives your character like um an item they hold in their hand when they're running it doesn't do anything it's just cosmetic and then it gives you the exclusive skin and then it gives you an exclusive banner so unite does this too you get that like pirate banner or you get whatever talonflames flame banner is that you can put around your character itself um but cinderace's uh legendary or whatever skin is at the end of the battle pass and then talonflames is hidden in the loopbox so i would assume that eventually talonflames will move to a battle pass oh probably or there'll be a point where you can just straight up purchase it yeah but it's like it's whatever it's fine it's like a thing you chase i understand it's a reminder these do not change the gameplay experience of the actual character i mean i am foolishly chasing the elder goss coat for my character because i think it is the cutest thing i've ever seen and i want it so much that i did refill i did buy an extra tank to try to get it from the random drops i do i i do want to just disclose i said this on stream the pokemon company did send me a code for unite it came with the 50 gem bonus so 3 500 gems so just full disclosure i have not spent that money i spent my own twenty dollars i bought the crime rate scan about a cramer ant um i have not spent that money but i just want to disclose they did send me have you gotten your name yet uh i didn't i did i didn't respond to them yeah they they held my name they held a bunch of content creators names like cerebe uh had their name held because when i like logged in that night i went to do pkmncass and it said this name is unavailable and then i was like uh did somebody already take it and then i typed in steve and it was like this name is not or this name is already taken and i was like oh well that's a different message yeah yeah i was like am i on some blacklist yes so i got sbj which i thought was like sweet i was like oh three letters sbj so i got that so when they were then the next day they were like oh we held your name and here's some gems that we hope you enjoyed the game i was like oh that's really nice but also i kind of like just having sbj that's pretty sweet my is what is going to always be branding yeah yeah i know always be true look no one's going to play me and unite and be like wow that guy sucks let me check out his podcast i mean i i will say that i have seen people who've played against in other types of games against a streamer who have come in to say hey that's super fun that was a great match i'm gonna hang around and see like i i will not be on board saying that people don't get things off of the branding that they see in a competitive game online my issue is as i was typing in my name and not paying attention i did not notice that there's a 10 character limit and my typical branding is 11 characters so it left off that last character and i locked it in you can pay the however much to change it nope we are washing the sin for our pokemon united which i really actually like i was like oh there it is okay greg you you okay so before we move to how much money greg put in the cramaran outfit is 20 the only other two outfits that exist were the snorlax outfit and the talonflame outfit both are 554 gems which i think is close to ten dollars uh because the cramer was 13.70 um and i don't know why the cramer ant is double the price because it doesn't do anything special instead it's actually kind of a bad outfit as somebody who's paid 20 for this outfit i'm upset it forces your character to be blonde like i have black hair if you're watching the youtube video feel free to like subscribe i have dark hair and the i i think i get why it does the blonde hair because it's supposed to like blend in with the beak yeah and it's supposed to represent the beak i think the crystal cap gives you blue hair yeah it does it does it does but if i'm paying 20 this is the most expensive character outfit and it forces me to be blonde it's really frustrating they're never going to change it i thought so when i saw that and i saw you complain about bob i think the isn't the idea supposed to be like you're in its mouth like you're the fish being spit out like it's supposed to represent its open mouth and you're trapped inside like that's that's the feel i got from it so i'm like oh yeah i can see why they changed the hair color to match so it looks more like you are you have been gulped by the crammer ant and they're about to be spit out but i always get your frustration very weird i don't want blonde hair to be like we're forcing your hair to be different yeah it is a little weird for twenty dollars more options than the the ten dollar options like what uh greg how much money did you spend uh i did the 1999 125 plus 125 bundle the top yeah the 12 1200 plus 1200 yeah yeah yeah uh i did that i paid that i put that money in that's all i've put in so far you were against putting money in last week so uh here's the thing like i put money into dragalia lost because if i feel like the game has ultimately respected my time or or treats me fairly well for the time that i've put in then i'm like okay i will pay money into to to get fluff things to get extra content like things that don't really change the game so it was a really good deal i'm like i'm having i'm i'm definitely having this much amount of fun i feel like i i don't like the caps that they have like i don't like that things cap out during the week but i get why they did it but i felt like the rewards from the battle pass plus were good enough for the price and i'm having enough fun that i'll make a one-time i i'm having enough fun that if i was at target i would have bought this for twenty dollars if i had to buy a code and play it i am having enough fun that i would have walked into target and said give me that for 20 bucks easy easy deal done and obviously you bought the battle pass i bought the battle pass plus whatever the oh never did the battle pass plus and the battle pass plus i did the plus because i liked what the plus items were in the list that it showed me it's the same things you just get yeah 10 levels above faster yeah i used to do for i wanted to get those i wanted to get those faster apex fortnite call of duty they all have battle pass pluses it's just you get a level jump right off the bat it's it's the it's the clash royale thing in unite foreign like i want those things and i want them a little faster and it i think the price was worth it i i think i think that was like the one okay thing they did is you can't even access the battle pass until you get to level five yeah so you would think like well we already talked about how the gem system sucks it's very obscure and you would think they would be they would be like hey get this battle pass right away but they you do i mean it's not long you have to play like an hour to get to level five or something like that um but you can't get the battle pass right away i think the battle pass is like in my opinion of having battle passes in other games clash royale apex etc uh i think it's kind of bad it is full of like cosmetics that i would just it's the same problem apex has they just fill it with a bunch of stuff you you're just never going to use like i'm never going to equip these socks i'm never going to equip these shorts i'm never going to equip this like generic blue shirt like i i gave you twenty dollars for a crammer and outfit i'm gonna wear that i'm never gonna wear any of these other clothes when you get near the end of the battle pass you start getting a pikachu outfit you get like the pikachu now that like the pikachu ears are cool yeah and like the pikachu hoodie is cool and obviously the skinner cinderace special skin or whatever that's cool cinderella but like there's so much filler in that battle pass that it's like not a great first battle pass but we'll see in 60 days huge mistake was making the black t-shirt in black shorts one of the first like free things that i unlocked because i was like set done look i am i am hunting the elder elder glass outfit i want the pants i want i really want the jacket i want the jacket more than anything i kind of want the shoes uh but i really want that jacket and i am i am on the hunt for that jacket and i'm upset that i haven't gotten it yet and when people show up if you show up in that outfit and i don't have it yet you are not getting a good job for me no matter how well you did you you are not getting it i'm mad at you will how much money did you put in zero so no battle pass for you no no i if i'm gonna buy anything it's gonna be the ability to uh acquire the held items and upgrade the held items because that's what actually helps you to win the game yeah but the battle pass has the things you need to upgrade the items well but it has other stuff i don't want so i'm just honestly so my evaluation is yes i very much agree with the philosophy that if you're playing a free-to-play game and you're playing it a lot that throw the people who made the game some money they deserve it because they've made a game if i am sitting down by myself and not with one of my friends who loves to play mobas i play monster hunter stories i'm not going to play unite i play unite because it is literally the thing that brings me and two of my friends who play two different mobas we can play this one together so it hasn't reached the point where i would want to give it money i i enjoy playing it i enjoy playing snorlax i don't need to pay money i already got my float stone upgraded so yeah snoglax is doing fine i realized uh as i was talking to a friend of mine because i it came out and i was playing it on wednesday and they texted me like did you take today off i'm like no i'm literally doing it on conference calls where i don't have to pay attention like i realized after the first day that i am playing this solo i'm going into ranked battles by myself to learn how to play this game this is not my normal experience for these types of games i'm really into this game and therefore i'm going to give it money like i made the decision at the end of the day on wednesday i'm like i've been playing this all day i have been playing this by myself without my friends i have been playing this game i'm mad that i have to stop playing to go do a recording that i agreed to do i i am very into this game and even if after a week that i have i've stopped it and said it's too frustrating for that week and just for those few days i'm like you have definitely impressed me i will definitely give this money speaking of money uh i i did buy one character i bought cramer ant obviously not a lot of people have cramer ant it wasn't one of the free options that you could pick off the bat the characters are different prices so for example absol is ten thousand coins or or or about seven bucks um alolan nine tails is only eight thousand coins or about six dollars charizard is six thousand coins or about five dollars um i did ask people who played league this is or not league um is it it's league league uh yes because league has character rotation so every week in league there's like two characters you can play for free which this game has this week it's like ma chop or sorry yeah machop and um gibbel or sorry garchomp and why can't i machamp i was like why can't i remember machop's evolution uh those are those are free to play for the week and those will rotate which is nice because you get to um you get to see if you even like these characters or not and then they did say in league that some characters are just more money than other characters to unlock i think league has like what like 80 some characters at this point but they they said like older characters will go on sale or or new powerful characters will always be 10 000 coins or whatever the most expensive so that doesn't seem too uncommon in in that regards but like going back to like the buying characters because there is a lot there's just some characters like i don't ever plan on buying like i just didn't enjoy machamp at all to the point where i like i'm just not gonna spend the eight thousand coins on my champ like i if he's free for the week i'll play him it's a good character though but his speedy tasty attacks but that's not my playstyle and like like venusaur was another one where i was like venusaur and cinderellas have the same thing that i just hate in games where they have like this long range thing that you have to aim and if you miss it you you just lose like you you missed your shot and you're done for it and i like crammer ant because cramer ant does camera ant has like a lot of aoes um like the ao the only aoe he doesn't have is dive which i don't run dive i run whirlpool i run surf and hurricane um but even with dive even though that's not an aoe you don't really miss it because he like he goes right to the target um anyways so i don't know maybe because i'm just a bad player and i'm just i don't i can't aim like i can't aim cinderella's blaze kick i can't aim venusaur solar beam mad props to people who can there's there's a practice tutorial for that that you can do my so actually just in a gameplay mechanics thing i have found that playing with the pro controller i can aim with the r stick much easier than if i'm playing with the joy cons oh my only pro controller uh the responsiveness of attacks i find is much faster on the joy cons because the buttons are smaller so it's lower uh press rate i heard somebody say this and i a million percent agree with them i can't tell if the controls are too loose or too tight in what's like i feel like when i'm aiming i'm like do i want this to be like a little slower or do i want this to be a little faster so like here's the question it feels slightly off and i can't tell which way it feels off are you when you aim are you doing process hold down attack button twirl joy-con yeah or are you doing moving with top joy-con holding the r button and then moving bottom joy-con to aim just like in a shooter okay so what you need to get to pro tips is hold the attack button knock the right joy-con in the direction you want to go and release don't don't swirl it to kind of aim it into you've got to know and just knock that thing oh god okay all right i'll try that i knock and release it's like the radial menus in monster hunter right although the what makes those easier is you're holding the other side like you're holding the left trigger and then moving the right joy con to do the radial monster menus in in monster hunter but it's more difficult because both things are on the right side so unless you can reprogram that uh maybe i did the thing so i played i played standard controls eight hours or whatever ten hours the first day and then i did the thing where i changed where like this is one attack and then this is the other attack because initially these are the two attacks yeah sorry that makes it harder to harder to aim because they're both on the right side so yeah hold the attack and knock the knob because your your your hands naturally fall on zr and rz or zr and zl your your your fingers naturally fall in those so that's where i put the two attacks and i had to relearn but it's it's way better because then then this this your right hand is doing so much it spreads it out and it feels like um i don't know it feels like a normal game so i put for support i put the damage move on the zr and i put my heel move on the r because i i don't naturally hit that button so it stops me from accidentally hitting it so i have to be more deliberate on okay i have to move up and hit my heel now and i don't have to think i have to heal and use my other hand it is here and then when i want to i know i have to do the heel i can quickly bump up and i don't have to do a lot of things the things that i'm really not good at is aiming i am terrible at aiming i did switch it so that the a button attacks opponents and the b button attacks wild so that yeah i can do that pretty good now uh i think but yeah it the controls get a little bit and i i am with you i'm terrible at aiming but luckily that even if i don't aim correctly with pollen puff which i usually run i just have to get it into an area where either an enemy is coming from or you're going to and we all get a benefit from it no matter what i think the reason i can't flick i was thinking about this will is like with cinderace and soul and and venusaur you have that like long range move and you flick in that direction but with kramer ant i'm placing a circle where hurricane is going to go oh i'll throw them up in an air so i have to kind of like i i don't need it to go super far like when i'm getting chased i i actually have to put it like right behind my butt because that's where they're going to end up and if i put it too far they've already run past it so i feel like i have to hold that button to like place the circle in the circle to make it a little easier to to hold the button to aim and then use your like put the put it on the left side to do the activate the the attack and then that way you're doing two different hands so you'd use your right hand for targeting your left hand for activating the attack that might make it easier yeah or i just give up that i'm never gonna be good at cramer no i mean i had the same problem with pollen puffs like i have to throw up behind me sometimes and i'm like this isn't going to happen i'm just throwing it on because i get the speed boost there are some settings and i change all the settings where like um one is like so you can like move and then aim and that's like a toggle uh otherwise and then there's like some smart settings where like the game will try to like auto aim for you and sometimes that messes it up um there's there's some weird stuff yeah oh yeah there's nothing like uh having three of your opponents running towards you and your bros and you hit attack and you jump over on it at an audino yeah i hate that okay so some people have this circle on the side that's got the characters yeah pies what is that i i don't know what that um so it's just a toggle in settings i don't remember what toggle it is it's like it's like ripple you know the there's the there's the advanced setting which is you can hit a you can hit a to attack everyone or you can hit a to attack people and b to attack right uh enemies and that's that messed me up so badly because when you're when you spend 10 hours just hitting the a button and then you change that to like oh now i have to hit the b button and then when you're getting attacked by enemies you're at least for me i was like still hitting b button but it they're not enemies they're real people so you're not doing anything but then i realized that oh you can still hit the a button it will do uh and it will do bots but when a person shows up it will default to that yeah and the reason you would want that on is because the game only cares about last hit so you don't want to default attack like roton or yeah rotom because you might want to wait and then get the last hit in so there's a reason to have that on and once you learn it it's it's worth having on but you can continue spamming the a button the other thing i didn't realize is even though b is attacking enemies or bots only when you wanted to bots being like the audit no's and stuff sorry for people who maybe don't know that language um it also cancels your move so i would like hurricane or i would surf but then i would go back to hitting b to like finish attacking the audino and then my hurricane and my surf would never activate and then i was like what is my game broken what's happening but because i was i was hitting the surf button and then hitting b so fast it was literally just canceling out my surf and it took me like four hours to like what am i doing wrong like why is my circuit like so like i turned it off and i was like okay everything's normal again and then i realized oh like even though it's saying b is attacking bots it is still cancelling your other attack well i don't know how fast other pokemon attack but kramer ant there's like a small wind-up for hurricane and four surf um so once you get over all that it's like fine but there's a lot like i guess that's a good thing about the game like you can really customize the controls and you probably should yeah okay uh let's take a break yep so we'll be right back what is a nidoran supposed to be it's a mix of porcupine a rabbit dinosaurs mouse whales jackalope probably a horse and hamster porcupine a rabbit dinosaur is a mountain whales jackalopes probably a horse yeah but then like what then what are [Music] whales jacqueline probably a horse and hamster [Music] and we are back from our break before we talk about the pay to win that is pokemon unite uh it is podcast award season so uh it ends on july 31st if you're listening to us on july 26 you have a few days look you're gonna forget and uh i did a very bad job at promoting this this month so so i need you all look you would have waited last minute anyways it doesn't matter yeah do you have to go to podcastawards.com log in with a new account because apparently the three of us tested this earlier and all the accounts don't exist from last year yep so make a brand new account name email password once you get past that you go to games and hobby you select it's super effective and then you hit vote and that's it you can select other shows for history or best female or best male all that stuff you can do all of that as well but we think of it as a happy eleven years it's super effective there you go we're gonna be 11 years we got nominated last year so thank you to everyone who helped nominate us last year we were in the finals last year we didn't win there's not a lot of competition in games and hobby this year so it probably takes maybe three minutes out of your day podcastawards.com click the button that says nominate make a fresh account i promise your account from last year doesn't exist make a new one we already tested this make a new one and then you just get a bunch of drop downs just drop down games and hobby it's super effective and then if you want to vote for other things feel free to and then hit submit that's it that's all you got to do the more people that do that there will be a second vote in august and so we need as many people to do it this week because when the second vote comes out in august we need you guys to get randomly selected for the second vote which is very weird but the more people that do it the more people that are in our favor for we we've tried to win this for like 11 10 years at this point one day we will i think this is the year as long as everyone does it this week i'll remind you guys on twitch i'll remind you guys in slack i'll remind you of the discord um once you figure out that your email and password from last year doesn't work it's much easier yeah just make sure to hit that check box on when you create your account that says you want to be considered for placing a vote for the final roster i think by default it's checked right nope oh okay yeah well hit that checkbox too you want to be in the second vote you want to have the power to vote um so yeah that would really help us out if you if you do that also it is near the end of the month so i usually bring up the patreon stuff but i'm only bringing it up to save you money so uh we're gonna do to celebrate 11 years i'm going to be sending out these care packages to anyone at the 25 a level 25 tier and higher they're going to include a shirt i'm not going to say what's on the shirt but if you're following my youtube stuff there's a weekly series and there's like a logo i use uh that might be on the shirt um it comes out every sunday night i don't know what it is okay that's fine uh but it'll include a shirt to include a bunch of other goodies it'll be very nicely packaged for anyone at the 25 tier now i'm saying this because don't on don't in july sign up for it yet because you'll be charged 25 this week and then it'll be charged 25 once it turns august 1st uh wait until august 1st that will be a little special limited time thing so if you're if you're like a 10 patron or you're a 5 patron and you want the gift package with the shirt and everything else you can just sign up for august and then once september comes you can just downgrade uh you don't have to you don't have to stay on it if you want to stay at the 25 tier cool because every three months you get a package anyways but this is just a bonus package on top it's kind of like a way to push people towards patreon to be like hey you can get this cool exclusive shirt you'll only be able to get it through patreon um and you get other goodies as well if you want to stay there or maybe you've never gone to patreon.com it's super effective but you want to that'll be the time so that'll go up on august 1st it'll be a two-week limited thing so anyone who signs up for the first two weeks at the 25 will get that package the package probably won't ship until the end of september the end of august though sorry i think i said september the end of august though just because i'm going to get the shirts made locally uh and they they take like three weeks because they gotta approve it and they gotta press it and a lot of stuff so more details will come but um if you did sign up for patreon uh cool i hope you enjoy the slack and all the other stuff that comes with it and the bonus podcast and the that free and all that stuff okay pay to win pokemon unite when when pokemon unite came out i looked through everything and i was like this isn't paid to win because you can't okay so it is pay to win there's there's no sugar coating that but they they set it up in a way where it doesn't look like pay to win uh which is a little yes that's how they do it yes well normally no clash royale was never uh it's just like it's just like illegal drugs have a little taste have a little taste then you'd like you want more well the only way to get more is to throw some money and get these health items from clash royale was never shy about being paid to win no there okay the pay to win thing in this game is called item enhancer and if you if you click on it it is it is 10 uh tickets i don't know what this currency aos tickets there's okay so there's eos gems there's ao eos coins and then there's eos tickets and in comparison if you wanted one of these held items like focus band it is either a thousand coins which is pretty easy to get i was able to get 10 000 coins the first day playing uh or 625 tickets so you cannot with real money by the focus band now when there was a huge article on our like r slash nintendo or something and it got a ton of upvotes and the guy complained that this game was really pay to win and he talked about these items so initially he's wrong right because you can't actually buy these items with money you can buy them with coins and tickets but you can't just put 50 in the game and buy these items but once you get the items they're permanently unlocked and there's only like 15 of them it's like scope lens muscle band wise glasses so far yes it's like a assault vest rocky helmet and you need the item enhancer which is only 10 tickets you can't use coins you can't use gems and you need the item enhancer to upgrade these items so at the surface level these are the these are the two things that equal the the winning right like you can buy characters right like eva in apex legends you could buy mirage you could buy caustic you could buy a rampart but you're not those aren't really paid to win they're just different characters in different play styles i mean i guess you could maybe argue that one character is more powerful than the other um until they get nerfed so if if these items were just unlocked through coins and tickets i think it would be fine but the problem is the item enhancer makes these items better and there's in my opinion a pretty significant difference and i think if you're a casual player you probably would shrug your shoulders and go oh that's not that big of a deal but at these high level plays or in matches when it comes down to like oh he had one hp left like that super matters and i wasn't super convinced the first day i played that these items mattered so much until there was a couple youtube videos that came out so one youtube video showed floatstone floatstone it says here item detail increases movement speed when not in combat so that sounds pretty good right because like when you die you gotta run back to an area and if you can get there faster that's better right like i don't think anyone's disagreeing with that that sounds pretty strong so a a level one float stone so the the youtuber put a level one float stone next to i think it was like a level 20 float stone and they showed the side by side and the character with the level 20 float stone got there like two seconds faster which is a pretty big deal in a 10 minute match in my opinion to get to an area two seconds faster to do what you need to do is a pretty big deal the more concerning thing for me i think it was muscle band which increases attack and i think this was a different youtube video but they put it side by side but they showed uh i think it was a gibble or a machop both with muscle band one had a level one muscle band and one had like a level 20 muscle band and the one with the level one muscle band had to hit the audino three more times before it knocked out and that's a lot a moba like yeah like even you're like oh well that's only one audino and that's only three hits you're probably knocking out 20 some audinos in a 10 minute match i mean i upgraded xp share to level 10 and for my elder gus it gives me like i say it's like 60 or 70 more health and then i have the barrier that i also upgraded so i have like 120 extra health and there are new players who think they can attack me and wear me down and you'll get me down but i can hit my heel because i have a bigger health buffer than you're expecting and it makes a huge difference because i can kite you back to a bunch of people that are gonna murder you because you think oh this aldegast is going to go down soon because i fought other elder glasses and they don't have a lot of health well surprise i have paid i have used the items to increase my health on two items so i have a buffer you are not expecting you're expecting me to fall faster than i am and it affects my shields it affects when i hit things and heal back like it makes a huge difference over the course of a game and the faster you can level them up the bigger advantage you're going to have and that is just a fact it is a pay-to-win game like a lot of other moba games are well but with the caveat that you can throw a million dollars into this game if you're not good at actually manipulating the characters on the screen or understanding this track i mean there are i honestly before putting money into it if you are starting to really enjoy this game you've got to learn what the difference between rotom and dreadna are yeah and who goes for rotom and who goes for dreadnought because that is very meaningful and that's not about the money that you put into the game like you're like i i agree that on some level money isn't going to overcome poor skill level like it's gonna help but if you are just bad or you make bad choices or you don't know how to or where to go like throwing money at the game isn't gonna fix you not knowing how to play the game but you're gonna you're gonna learn how to play the game or you're gonna find people that that teach you how to play the game like there are already a lot of good guides like yep you should be here you should be here this is what this is this is who these are the people you're supposed to support and you can take in that knowledge uh but paying to win are paying to increase these items is going to give you more time to get that skill it buys you a little extra oomph to help refine what you're doing well but also fundamentally if if you and i have equivalent skill levels in the game but i have bought the items and upgraded the items i will win yeah i will beat you yeah yes yes yep now i i was told again i'm i'm i'm just parodying things that i was told by people who played a lot of league of legends um that this did exist in league it was called runes correct and you could equip runes and you could pay to upgrade the runes but league has gotten rid of that system yeah also you can just equip a rune and that's fine uh who knows if matt if unite will go down that route right now whether or not you like it it is a thing that exists in the game uh there there's a couple so so i i i stress that that that our slash nintendo thing was slightly incorrect i mean they did say the game is pay to win that's true but they didn't explain how to do it they pointed out two items well they pointed out the i the the held items and they pointed out the what is the purple thing called it's called um the item enhancer yeah those are two things you can't actually pay money for right so the big question is like how do you get that so the the way around it the actual pay to win which is like really kind of backwards because i feel like if they just wanted to make money they would just let you buy these two with coins i don't know why they didn't order gems sorry i don't know why they just didn't put a gem button next to it because they would have made money um maybe they just didn't want it to be so transparent i think they don't want to be so transparent i think i think the importance of an easy barrier of entry and those things are hidden helps to keep the game from seeing like suffering from moba toxicity right like it doesn't let people who are very familiar with mobas to be like oh immediately this is a toxic game this is a bad pay to win situation um and i think it also gets hidden so that the majority of casual players don't interact with it and don't sort of understand what it is or how to do it and so it sort of starts to separate out the player base to some extent to like people who don't understand it can all have a very casual still fun experience and in ranked battles they're going to start separating themselves out and it makes a weird dual system in the game that i'm not overly fond of but i kind of get their reasoning behind it a little bit very clash royale yeah it is um so so how you pay to win at this point in the game or there's two ways you either use spend 200 gems on the um gotcha mechanic yep so that adds energy back into the gotcha mechanic and when you earn this is a weird mechanic we we haven't even explained this the the worst thing that this game does is there's like 17 menus yeah and they all don't make sense they're all like where where do i go to equipped an item what is this gotcha mechanic what of the three different stores do i have to go to to purchase something what currency am i using out of the six currencies you have even worse the the actual biggest crime that this game has committed is the x menu which is your prime menu for going through and doing stuff you go x to open the menu you select what you want to go into you go into it every human on this planet has the expectation and right i dare to say right to hit b to get back to the x menu that i started from not b to exit it all completely so i have to start from the beginning again shave on you timmy shame playing the game doesn't enrage me as much as that x and b combo because i get so mad when it kicks me out dead and improvement here's a true story i was on wednesday it was upstairs i was playing unite i did that exact combo and i swore very loudly and suddenly my husband is running upstairs going what's wrong did you fall did something fall over and i had to look at him and go it's just this stupid game i got very very mad poor ui okay so there there is a gotcha mechanic in the game we talked about this earlier this is the way to get the talonflame skin it does the game for some of its faults we've talked about the game is transparent in that's gotcha mechanic it is a half a percent a one in 200 chance of getting the talonflame thing out of the gotcha machine but when you complete a match you get like 20 to 30 uh energy and every time you get to 100 energy you can crank the gotcha machine and it pops out a very bland shirt or like coins or something i got a pair of socks better than you pokemon go yeah every every week you get a thousand energy so you get 10 loot boxes a day you can spend 200 gems which is what like four bucks and you can add another thousand to it you can also spend um gems to earn more energy per week or whatever like you can earn the energy faster uh so the pay to win comes in through two options the gotcha machine so putting money into the gacha machine to get the item enhancers or to get tickets to buy item enhancers or by leveling up your battle pass by paying to level up your battle pass and that's not new every right every little literally every game clash royale fortnite call of duty apex they all have an option where you can buy levels in a level battle pass but because you cannot buy these item enhancers outright you either have to pay to upgrade your battle pass or you just pay for the gacha machine and that is where the pay to win comes in so they do obscure it in a way um but but it like like like there's no if anyone's trying to like say like it's not pay to win i don't know what kool-aid they're drinking it is and that's like look it's fine it doesn't matter if somebody's paid a hundred dollars or somebody's paid zero dollars i will still lose it's it's okay it's fine i actually kind of feel better if the you know 100 person beats me because you know they spent money and i didn't that's fine it's okay i i think inherently look if you don't ever want to play a game that has a pay to win advantage i respect that i played greg and i both played clash royale for three years every day it was it was paid it was pay to win day one yeah it was but i still won a majority of my matches i still had a great time i think i ended up putting maybe in the three years of that game i put in like 25 to 30 dollars uh five of it went to a charity thing which i'm like still very happy with and it was fine like i i it's so hard like i get it i get being like this game is pay to win i'm staying away from it but also like you're going to lose yeah whether it's pay to win or not like i you're just going to lose and for me i've just never been like in clash royale when i was like level 8 and you dropped in front of like a level 11 and all their units were maxed out and like you you recognize that right away you go like oh that dude spent like probably 500 bucks to be where he is like i'm not mad that he's going to win it's just like whatever you won cool like yeah the matches are so fast i'm just gonna get into another match and move on like it's totally cool yeah i had a brief heartburn over the rank system when like i lost and it dropped me down a pip and i'm like excuse me i heard that how dare you yeah but then i sort of re-centered and i'm like i i need to focus on less about the rank and more about am i having fun and sort of accepting the fact that i am going to lose every i'm going to lose a number of times and what keeps that from being not a horrible experience is the matches are capped at 10 minutes so i'm like i'm just gonna jump into another one and have a good time and b i don't have an active voice chat screaming toxicity at me i feel like there's this like perception of like gosh i don't even know how to explain it like people are people think that oh the game is pay to win so i lost because they paid money right which which in reality is like i feel like you're just trying to like coat that you lost and just accept that you lose like i mean like it's it's what i said earlier at the beginning of the podcast i can tell in a game that i am the weak link like like it is so self-reflective of like this is why we're losing it's because of me and i think a lot of people just don't want to accept that and don't want to point it out so the first thing they jump to is oh that dude spent more money yeah like i know you just you it's okay you're just bad at the game or you just had or like you just had a bad game it's like yeah like some like i i have dropped in apex legends and i have died right away and it's like am i bad no i just i just dropped in a bad spot that that person just picked up a gun before me uh i i my cat jumped on my lap i have also dropped in apex legends and i've won like three games in a row yeah with with pickup groups like it's whatever it's like you don't get the highs of winning without the lows of losing right it's it's it's like the rng you can get better at things um and i guess the way to circumvent that is just always play with friends yeah that definitely helps but if if you have to just kind of like look the pay to win is bad i'm not defending it it's like it like it's and i dealt with it in clash royale and it was i would say that my clash royale experience was good because i played it for three years if it was bad i would have quit earlier um but the game genuinely was fun yep and it was doing a lot of things that i really liked that no other game was doing and i and there's not a fiber right now in this podcast recording where i i cannot say that pokemon unite is not fun it is incredibly fun it is it is it is a game mechanic or a type of game that i want in my life right now and i will lose matches because i am playing with random people and some people on my team might be good and some people on my team might be bad but that is the same for the other team they might have really good players and really bad players i might have an afk player they might have an afk player i might have a whale on my team who spent a lot of money they might have a whale like there's so many variables going in that i feel like if you're going to just push off the game and be like it's pay to win i'm not playing it that's fine but also i don't think that's your problem right right i think your problem is you're afraid to lose over and over and i get it losing success yeah losing stinks no no no no no you can tell when also when people are coordinated like they're in a chat together because oh yeah they're like oh they're all talking to each other because these things are happening way too fast or you roll up and everyone has very similar names i'm about to get wrecked it's hard in a com it's hard to suppress like the competitive nature that we have in ourselves and if you get super frustrated at losing over and over and over again like it's it's easy to be like i just played an hour i lost every match that i was in uh and that is a disheartening feel but i i think but i also don't think you just dropping a bunch of money is going to fix that no truth but also a person dropping about some money didn't necessarily make that different like you sort of have to figure out what about the game makes you happy and play the game and be like i still find enjoyment of this i don't think pay to i don't think paying somebody paying automatically negates that formula right like there are ways around the pay to win thing like i'm gonna play with my group of friends we're only gonna do friendly matches we're only gonna i'm only gonna do quick matches i'm only going to do the weird three three match that you can like there are uh there are ways to interact with the game where that doesn't become a huge factor i think i think you made a super good point greg like you have to find what brings the enjoyment out of you and i i think i saw that and and i knew this was going to happen like i stream on twitch people always want a backseat like this happens all the time like when i do competitive vgc or one especially if you're ever playing the pokemon trading card game online people are like why'd you play that card why don't you do this why don't you do like like i had somebody go like why are you using that hell dad i'm on cramer ant because i'm using the silly claw the a palm claw thing which lets you um it lets you do more damage to bots oh oh yeah isn't that a fluffy tail one fluffy tail yeah yeah and they were like oh you should be running eject button on cram and it's like or they'll be like why are you running hurricane and not air slash and it's like because i legit have fun with these this moveset and this item yeah so i i am i am sure that air slash or dive is a better combination than surfing and uh hurricane i am sure that this float stone shouldn't be on crameran and shel bell should be um like but the way i set up my cramer ant i love it yup and it is fun for me and it has gotten me to where i am in it and i'm cool with that and yep once i get bored with that or once i feel like i am confident and i want to venture out i will make that move but i think it's really important for people to play something you are super comfortable with and if if somebody wants to give you feedback like if somebody go if i'm like you know i hit my i hit my ceiling with cramer i'm not sure what else i can do and if that choice is removing floatstone and putting on assault vests i'll do that when i get there but like right now i like where i'm at and i'm having fun and i think that's super important is like if you have a different mindset where like you want to come into this game you want to drop some money you want to be the very best i props props to you i'm genuinely having a good time just playing i don't get i i can't say i don't get salty when i lose it is incredibly frustrating when you have a teammate that like wants to give up in the first like two minutes of the match it is frustrating when you have a teammate literally refuse to leave camp and do they just they've just accepted the game as over uh it also feels good when that teammate literally sat and camped for eight minutes and you still win the match yeah that felt great yeah and it also felt great on the winning screen when everyone thumbs up each other but that one dude that didn't do anything and then i reported him for being inactive because he was oh i didn't even know you could thumbs up people yeah you can good job people here's the thing here's the thing here's my life advice for this podcast advice isn't advice unless the person asks for it if you're just giving advice and the person never asked for it you're just spouting your opinion at a person who's like go away yeah advice only becomes advice if somebody says hey can you give me advice on what i'm doing here because they're only then are they receptive to hearing what you have to offer right like if i if i say to my twitch chat i don't know what i did bad in that match like i like look like i i was i was last in the match i kept getting killed by this gengar i don't know how not to get killed by the gengar i don't know should i go somewhere else like and and no one has an answer right and right that's fine because everyone's new at the game like there was one point i was playing guard chomp and like right before i never played guard chomp it was just like the team needed an all-rounder i was like i'll take one for the team i'll search a guard chump i played them like twice and then like i pan i panicked and i added my three best items it was like shell bell it was literally what i planned cram and then somebody in chat was like i don't think shel bell should be on garchomp after i like died and i would thank you yeah i'm gonna go out on a whim and say shell bell is not the reason why i'm losing right now i'm exactly very confident like my held items in the situation do not matter this team has been like stopping the whole like me and everyone else like it's fine like it was clear that our team had no synergy i'm not very good at garchomp they had some sort of coordination whether it was voice chat or not and they they they destroyed us like it wasn't even close um and that's fine like that happens same thing in any other game you can drop in apex legends and just get wiped right away it's not the end of the world it's nice that uh unite matches are only like 10 minutes long and then 10 minutes goes by super fast like longer than the three minutes of clash royale so like it is a bit of a time sync but it can feel long it can definitely feel long when your team gives up like three minutes in uh but if if your team is genuinely trying and it feels like an even fight that 10 minutes goes by yeah i'm so happy i've never had that experience our final battle last night where we were like we were struggling back and forth and we lost but only by a small mark yeah i think we only lost by like 50 points and like it was it was still a lot of fun like i still had a great time we lost and it was a it was not a close game for a for the whole start of the match and then we really cranked it at at the end and we still lost but i felt like everybody got together we did a lot of great things i made some mistakes i know i did i did dumb things whatever um and it's still fun like i think i'm like that was a still a good game there is one thing i wish i could turn off it's the announcer saying you lose at the end yeah i know you do not have to yell this at me this is not a function that needs to be in this game i am aware that i lost i do not need an announcer screaming from my tv that i lost let me turn that off or just get rid of it nobody needs it we know we lost i mean just turn the volume off i mean i try but then it gets really weird so my my key point in all of this that i want to get across is the the reminder that we must frequently make to people like people who play tcgs people who play mobas people who play anything that's player first player games are for fun if you're not having fun and just playing it is making you angry angry angry stop all right because you're gonna go into an anger pit the game's not gonna be fun for you it's just gonna become an obsession yep and you just need to walk away if you can't lose and laugh then you you're playing the wrong game there was a there was a point very early on in clash royale where i was not having fun and i think i stepped away for for two weeks and i think they did some sort of update to the game they did a lot of updates to clash royale a lot of updates but but they genuinely made the game better every time and made it more accessible and made made it more and like they balance characters and stuff and like right now oh we didn't even talk about this like right now it it is definitely frustrating to play against zera aura um i and i would probably maybe say gengar maybe because i don't understand how gengar works yeah i figured out zero's deal like i can usually now usually go toe-to-toe with zero like i i play i also played zero or well so i know what like they do i do not get gengar gengar wrecks me every time i'm like oh no like like no one's going on social media being like mr mime is overpowered or kramer ants overpowered or or like i can't figure out alolan ninetales or anything like that it is it is like primarily zera aura and gengar that have a lot of frustration around and zero or kind of makes sense because like it wasn't in the canadian beta it wasn't in any of the chinese betas it was like specifically just added and i am sure that like other games these characters will be tweaked i don't know if we have to wait till the end of the season for that i don't know if we have to wait a month i don't know if we have to wait two weeks but it does feel like specifically xeror and gengar are just a pain to play against um they're it's not impossible though like like i feel like xerora is on every enemy team i play and like i think i have like a 65 win ratio or something so it's like not impossible i think the i think the case that zero or zero is overpowered is faulty i don't think xero aura is overpowered i think it came out of nowhere i think nobody knew what zera aura did it has a very unique play style and i think people capitalized it on it very early on i don't see zera or a dominance like i did the first day i i i don't think i think it took people time to understand what the attacks are like discharge is going to do this if it hits you and it has a stun effect and that it can combine these things up so like you're learning how to compensate for it i think gengar being a locked character has a similar problem like i i don't run into it often enough and i don't know what it does i don't know what to expect from it but like zero or i expect the minute it shows up it's gonna spark at me it's gonna jump right to my thing so i need to eject to away from where it thinks it's going to be the thing with getting is it poisons you and then hex does a ton of damage yeah there is technically an option in the game which is full heal you could full heal yourself in poison and theoretically gengar shouldn't be able to like one shot you but no one's running full heal like everyone is just running eject button right um and like it's literally like the fourth day of the game and everyone just default and it doesn't help that like youtubers are like eject button is the best button and the best item and it's like yeah it's it's good but also what am i doing against gengar besides getting poisoned and then instantly dying maybe i should run full heal i don't know eject button makes sense for me i need to get out to heal people i need to jump like as elder goss i need that extra movement i need to be able to get to a place where i can heal and survive like i need the boost other people don't need the boost like understand what your character is supposed to be doing helps decide that button the reason doesn't work for everybody the reason i don't run inject button on cram is because i still can't get away from things fast enough even with eject button like like i think pikachu has a little bit too much range because even eject button away from pikachu i still lose that running away like it's whatever electro ball just follows and hones in so well i still like with eject button i still cannot speed gengar i still cannot speed up so i still can't out speed um talon well talonflame is not a problem no one's playing talonflame it's fine i mean some people are yeah there are some good talent players out there but like eject button allows me breathing space to get another heal in and if i can get if i can get the gap for a second and get another heal off i can win that fight i can kite you back to where you're slowed down and then i can really with net fight uh but i don't i i think everyone's like oh just use a check button because it lets you get away like no like that's great for ranged attackers that is not great for other things that's not great for snorlax who needs to stay up there and and wreck house snorlax needs a different item um but again it's early people are still trying to figure a lot of things out um like what's ideal uh i've had people say what are you doing running xp share like you don't get to auto level and i'm like for a million reasons i use xp share like there are other benefits that i get from it yeah it's it's like a very kind it's like a very meta thing of like like i like i've seen i've seen uh i've seen lists where people put venusaur at the bottom yep and like venus venusaur's the worst character don't play venusaur and i was literally in a game where venusaur destroyed everyone yes and i was like i don't know like and i knew i like i knew playing in the game like whoever venusaur is i don't know what you're doing at the two minute mark you're rocking it four minute mark holy cow what are you doing you're so good six minute mark i can just stop playing whoever's playing venusaur they're just winning and like and then the the end results came in and it was like yes venusaur literally dominated the entire match and this is like a character that most people wrote off like right away in four days where like no don't play venusaur he's the worst character and it's like like there's so much that like people play in different styles and people like different things and people have like i don't know maybe if that venus or player moved to a zero or a player they would have got they would have done even better who knows but like the i get why there's a toxicity to mobas or maybe other games of like why aren't you doing this why aren't you using this move why aren't you using this holodom why are you going like calm down calm down like like it was always frustrating for me to play vgc because i work with a coach i work with somebody who won a world championship so people would come into my stream and they would be like why aren't you running light screen on grimsnar why are you only running reflect and not light screen and then they're giving me all these like points about my team as i'm playing which is like fine whatever like i get it all the time but it's like and like like i know it's like really pretentious to say but it's it's like well how many world championships have you won because literally a world champion helped build my team and we practiced it and we went through and there's a reason why we're only running reflect on grimstar and we're not running light screen and like i don't know where i don't know where people come from but they're like why aren't you doing this and it's like i i feel like maybe there's a good intention of like i'm trying to help you out there he is but it's like but see point a advice that's not asked for is just your opinion uh so yeah it's it's it's frustrating people i i people have the best intentions right they want you to do better but how they express their best intentions is sometimes very toxic overall i think united is great i don't think it's perfect i don't think anyone thought that this game was gonna be released and be like this perfect amazing game i think if they keep adding new clothes they keep adding new characters i think if they balance stuff i think that would be great to increase the life of the game um i am sure there will be a in like two weeks pokemon unite is dead even though i'm sure that we'll be still making a lot of money and it will still be really healthy it's just the you know the players who wanted to play it for a week fell off and that's fine um oh i'm sorry one more thing before we we move on i just want to talk about zapdos as a mechanic um zapdos is like the golden snitch of pokemon unite if you've ever watched harry potter most games are won when the person catches the snitch because it's worth so many points uh zapdos is that mechanic it always appears in the center at the eight minute mark it is very frustrating when your team wants to concede before zapdos at the eight minute mark yeah it appears that eight minutes eight minutes in two minutes left two minutes left eight minutes and two minutes left um it's very frustrating when your team is losing and your your your team wants to concede and if i was on voice chat i guarantee you it wouldn't change the conversation because i would be yelling we can still win with zapdos and they would probably be like well i don't care we already lost game over conceived conceit but the amount like i think out of the 60 games i've played zaptos has always won me the game with the exception of two games and and to be fair not every game zapdos was taken like there are they're probably like 10 out of 60 games where no one got zapdos they just ignored it but you can be losing and i know some people have said like they need to change zapdos it's too powerful it's or it changes the game too much but i don't but if you're losing for eight minutes like it is literally the way you can win it's not a guaranteed win but if you change zapdos to the point where like it doesn't matter as much then there's not that weird comeback thing and like if you're winning zapdos is just as important and if you're losing zapdos is everything so i don't know how they fit i i like it i like the snitch mentality of zapdos i think it's weird that you know we're four days in and like if you're losing and your team still doesn't go to zapdos i don't know what's going through their mind i don't know how they think they're going to win if we're at eight minutes and they're not ignoring zapdos like it is the win condition if you're losing um and it is the thing you should still go after if you're winning like i feel like at least to me it feels balanced in the sense of like this is an important match this is an important point of the match for both players still um and it's not a guaranteed win like i said like i've gotten we've gotten zapdos twice and we still lost out of 60 matches but i don't know i don't know how you guys feel about it well i think what people are misunderstanding is they want the game to be only one thing i gather energy i score points on goals and what they're actually doing or timmy tencent is doing is saying eight minutes into the game the game changes it becomes either prevent your opponents from getting zapdos or do everything you can to get zapdos right so that is it's it's a catch-up mechanic there are a ton of catch-up mechanics in this game right because the more you score on your opponent's goal guess what you have fewer goals to get to and it's harder to get to them they they do tons of things but it's like the players who are complaining about zapdos only want to do one thing and they don't want the game to convert at any point during the game and i i've seen other pokemon in the middle so well on like um on like the three verse three map uh they put avalon in the middle yeah and then in like the 4v4 i think they put reggie giggs in the middle yep or sorry i think i flipped those i think reggie goes three first three avalon is four no reggie gigas is the yeah ready gage is the three avalog is the four because avalon's on the snob map and there's one more because there's another map but i i would still argue that the same people who don't understand that the game has to shift once the zapdos appears are the people who completely ignore rotom and completely ignore dreadnaught because they don't understand that those are actually mechanics that you need to or even further ignore ludicolo and ignore bouffalon which are buffs that you somebody should be grabbing yeah the speedster in the middle needs to be grabbing those so that you get buffs like the they're important parts they aren't they aren't necessarily game breaking i like last night the other team got the zapdos and we still held them off long enough to make it an incredibly close game like zapdos is a win condition it is not a for sure condition exactly um but it it is one of the few catch-up mechanics um it won't overcome certain things like if a person is just sitting at base and you're a 4b5 uh it is still going to be hard winning zapdos to get to those goals to score because you still have to get to them and you still have to get the energy into the goal and sometimes that's not possible if somebody has given up but it was one of the few catch-up mechanics that is still very important what's really happening is basically like you've been in a basketball game for eight minutes and then for the last two minutes it's a boxing match or what is it like uh what is it in wrestling when all the wrestlers get in the ring together free-for-all yeah pray for alzheimer's battle royale it's like but but that's the game yeah that's the game that they designed and gave to you you can complain because you only see it from one perspective but try to open your mind to understand that they does the design of the game is basketball for eight minutes two minutes of free-for-all and i don't i don't know like there have been so many games and i think the three games we played greg we we lo we were losing the first eight minutes and it was because like like i feel like if you remove the zapdos mechanic or you make it weaker where it doesn't square as many points i feel like that just makes the first eight minutes more of like well we should just give up right because like even there has been so many games where it's like okay we're losing but we can still win this we're losing but we can still win this we're losing but we can still win this and then we get zapdos and we win this and the games where we're losing we're losing we're losing we need to go to zapdos oh we didn't get zapdos yeah of course we lost because like yeah how like there was no like that is the way we win is zapdos um and there's been games where we've been winning we've been winning we've been winning they got zapdos oh they just won like we why didn't anyone go to protect zapdos why did we ignore it like will is right the game changes at eight minutes and it's an important end of the game and i i think reality like thematically it's exciting too like you are taking you are separating the team of five into three areas for eight minutes and then at the last two minutes those teams have to come together and have synergy i don't i don't think it's terribly broken i just think the game changes and people haven't figured out how to adapt to that yet yeah i will say like i've gotten the habit if somebody says oh i'm voting to surrender i've been going along with it because that person has just given up and stopped playing it at that point fine like i i don't want to give in because like like dude like i feel like that person saying we're surrendering at four minutes have they never one with have they do they know that zapdos appears at eight minutes do they even know there's an end game like have they never won by getting zapdos and feeling like oh we can still win this like what is what i don't know i don't get it i i have a feeling people like i'm just not the slots i want to get in the next game with whatever reason like it is often it is often a healthy person and quite frankly like i have i have voted to stay and have one but more often when that happens and i voted to stay they have refused to play and and then you then you yeah you give everyone else a thumbs up and you rep and you yeah you report that person for idling and they get they get a mark and they i don't know become a better player like i feel like the people that have the mindset of like i'm just gonna throw in the towel this is a loss like i get it like if you lost that zapdos you've been losing the whole game you lost that zapdos there's a minute left sure i guess concede right like save yourself a minute of time but if you have the mindset of like i'm not even going to try to play out the zapdos part and i'm just going to give up now like i feel like your mindset is you're always going to be in great league or you're always going to be in expert league like you're never going to push forward because you're not challenging yourself to come back from situations yeah i mean i agree that it's important but like i i've had a lot of bad experiences of people who just give up and i didn't sort of uh like the report uh the report function isn't obvious like it took me a bit to find it to be like oh this is what we do um i wonder how it works though like because it took me like three days to realize there's a thumbs up button yeah and i i learned the report button in the first day because like you would play like in the first five matches i think we had somebody like just idle and bass um and if you so at the end screen where it shows everyone's score you can like tab over and you can go up to the name and you can hit x and you can hit block so you never play with that person again but you can also hit it'll say report and there's two things you can report for you can report for idling and then you can report for i think like harassment but the harassment doesn't exist yet technically because there while there is a the reason we brought up voice chat earlier is because there is a button for in-game voice chat it's just not they just don't have it on like it just doesn't exist yet i think it might exist through the nintendo app probably but there's no like in-game voice chat in unite as i i'm i think most people probably are with friends in the food discord and that's fine um but yeah you can do harassment or you can do like not playing slash idling and when you hit the not playing idling it says it will give them a 10 point deduction on their account but i like obviously that's not manually looked by at a human it's just taking your word for it uh i've seen them get reversed yep like like somebody lost points and then they get a follow-up message that says we actually restored your points oh really yeah interesting i wonder like i wonder if somebody got reported for idling but then they also got like thumbs up for a good job i wonder if that cancels it out but i didn't realize the thumbs up was a like it's it's like a button right below i think report it'll say like good job but you should like ideally you should be good jobbing like players that are like like it does feel good to get a good job and monster hunter does this and final fantasy does this where at the end instead of just complaining about people you can be like hey even though we lost because ethan over here sat in the base for eight minutes uh that lucario dude was awesome give him a good job like reinforce good behavior yeah yeah yeah yep i agree all right sorry no question of the week we ran long i didn't even prepare a song because i knew this would be like a 17-hour show a whale what is our pokemon of the week all right let's do it quick last week's pokemon think of recent events this week's pokemon has less to do with dragons than it has to do with the woman who lent her family name to the sonic youth side project that produced the whitey album on april 5th 1988. so easy [Music] this came out last week monday [Laughter] i have been playing unite if it's not a character in unite i don't it doesn't exist so the entire previous weekend when i had to spend 40 hours with you people was nothing jeez you people you people it meant a lot in our friendship not towards pokemon of the week what what gracious me did you go to pokemon go fest what did you what did you get at the end of the first day of pokemon go fest four shiny scyther no adino you got meluetta melowetta is based on madonna because she sings and she dances i don't know i feel like i feel like that's britney spears i feel like that's christina aguilera i feel like that's could be shakira definitely shakira oh definitely shakira you heard it here first mellowed up based on shakira now hips don't lie none of these are from new york madonna came from the club scene of new york drew which is unova is based on new york i also referenced dragons which would be zechariah but also recent events being that this was the day after go fest ended which should have been and if you looked up sonic youth's album the whitey album that came out april 5th 1988 they called themselves the chicona youth which is madonna's last name which is chinchino good effort but there were no chinchinos in pokemon go fest not dude uh also what was the other thing it has two forms it sings and dances just like shakira what was that madonna movie dagnabbit now that just came i i just listened to a whole review of it truth or dare if you watch truth or dare you will see madonna sing and or dance it took me like eight years to realize that melody has like a headset on yes what it was like very not obvious at first if you watch zootopia you will see that shakira can sing and dance but shakira is from colombia she is not from new york i think she's from columbia you don't know it's from new york now hips don't lie oh gracious me here we go what do you got to say about mellowetta anything uh it is the lightest fighting type pokemon it was leaked on the poster of kirim vs the swords of justice during the black two white two is it even in that movie how is it lighter than mark shadow who is literally a shadow i don't know the pure the pureet farm is the lightest pirouette pirouette it says that melowetta is the only mythical not to have a starring role in the movie excluding fiona if it is considered one yes bulpita is it is considered one get get stop being a boomer get with the times we already moved past that fione is a mythical pokemon um melowetta is always programmed to have a star piece when encountered in the wild in black and white however mellowetta cannot be found in the wild in those games there's some trivia ah marshada weighs almost 50 pounds i know how it's a shadow it's a habit don't judge but does your shadow weigh 50 pounds to be fair marshado has like a weird coat on like a hoodie true very the thick hoodie the shuffle icon is outstanding both both shuffle icons fyi where are these uh yeah they're pretty good the eyes are a little weird look your eyes are a little weird uh the shiny is good as well stop being so toxic greg i know well if you get into the bottom lane to do your job the unite is already rubbing off i love how greg called it the bottom row okay this week's pokemon yesterday evening i had the delightful opportunity to enjoy an evening meal with the pokemon luminaries greg leatherman and nicholas burgess unfortunately villainy was afoot it was has become clear to me that at some point during the meal possibly when i stepped away to the toire as we were at a japanese restaurant someone tampered with my food and or drink i have become ill almost upon to death today i was clearly being targeted for someone else's choices as i had chosen an innocent tonkatsu donburi for my dinner as far as i know greg and his husband only ate chicken and vegetable dishes so the blame clearly falls upon nicholas burgess and his spouse as assigned i believe they shared a plate of odd delicacies which most likely included the item that caused our table to be targeted while i frequently avoid restaurants that serve pokemon in whole or in part dishes greg is the one who selected yesterday's place there are some pokemon-based foods that can be enjoyed without fainting the pokemon but i still object to the process of harming the pokemon i suspect one of the most notable types of these dishes featuring the tale of a not very intelligent pokemon was featured on the burgess's appetizer plate this particular pokemon features a split evolutionary line one with more intelligence than the other which is further bifurcated based upon which version of the pokemon it started from and what evolution item was used to evolve it only one of this pokemon's final evolutions has features that contribute towards his potential career as a nefarious assassin besides a black cape draped over its shoulders it is the only evolution that features a mask pulled over its face it also has easy access to poison the poison that has brought me to the edge of my grave today without a trainer this pokemon can only learn one poison type move its evolutionary sibling can learn too and i do feel that i have both taken damage and had my defense lowered that zigzagoon he wears a mask yeah like nick the reason there's a rock fossil event in masters is because there is a rock fossil event in go right now and there was a rock fossil event in sword and shield this weekend i think you can chalk it up to dialga going back in time to find these fossils as the alga is the reward but also there is a fossil exhibit happening in japan right now which is probably actually the reason why these events are happening that's so bad um but this is just the uh synergy that we say between the games that they've been doing a very good job at last the last like 12 months in doing there is an eevee community day next month and ironically enough evie here are evolving skies the next set which is very eevee focused is also coming out next month i'm going to chalk that up to synergy as well in my opinion i feel like that's not like they could redo eevee community day at any point but they're deciding to do it the month that a huge evtcg set is going out in america no incorrect i need to get all the eeveelutions in order to get to the next level in pokemon go like level 42 or oh they're doing it because will and i just turned over they got the news i turned over so they finally scheduled that community day makes sense there's been a fly in this room this entire podcast i'm losing my mind sure there is what else what is the fly telling you right now steve i'm a guy gonna bring like three cats in here to take care of this uh not doing anything back here uh thank you guys for listening hopefully you enjoyed the um the unite talk if you have any feedback or or you think we're wrong which we're not you're wrong obviously uh you can comment on the youtube video you can continue the discussion in our discord which is free our slack which is for our patrons um really really would help us out if you go to podcastawards.com make an account select it super effective hit vote it will only take like three minutes out of your day um also i'm having a big birthday stream on thursday on twitch so if you're uh around on thursday uh we'll be pretty much streaming all day we'll probably do unite sword and shield uh if there's talks maybe we do some mario kart with people uh look people love mario kart still number one guys i still love it but i'm like oh god do i remember how to play i don't remember how to play maybe we sneak in some other games i don't know uh barbie horse adventure who knows i already played that we've moved past barbie heart's adventure how about mitopia how about we just get rid of unite we move to league of legends we just commit bite the bullet go all in what's the closest character to kramer and league of legends will i have i don't know the characters the only i only know one character and that's yasuo so i'm a yasuo i mean now you don't you're not toxic enough i'm sorry we promise we'll be more toxic next week when we are all full-time unite professional players we'll have the jerseys made it'll be it'll be good thank you can i design the jerseys oh please thank you for all the yasuo mains out there for why you need to understand that what yasuo you're you're a toxic person it's because yasuo's key phrase that he yells out in the game is hazaki and then i know all of the yasuo mains out there convert that phrase at every chance they have to use it and yell it out so like if somebody has to go to the bathroom they yell out hossapi et cetera that's the and i'm tired of it that is the secret word for today's if i'm walking to the front door of your house you don't have to yell hassaky first off kramer ant and slowpoke the best combo in unite anyways uh we will be back next week greg is at whitewing on twitter will is that washingtonsync i'm at dragging a like if you want to follow the podcast on social it is p k m n c a s t on patreon tiktaar youtube twitch instagram all that stuff we will see you guys
