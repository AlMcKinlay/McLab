into my email at work it was ear 6 a.m. (1:01 - 1:08)
here I had to wake up at 5:50 a.m. it (1:05 - 1:12)
was 8 800 a.m. that is a normal work day (1:08 - 1:15)
also uh blocked off tentatively like (1:12 - 1:17)
okay this be about 20 minutes where I'm (1:15 - 1:20)
not available in teams do not bother me (1:17 - 1:23)
at work I have something to (1:20 - 1:27)
watch I know what it UK it was like 2 p (1:23 - 1:29)
p.m. or something like that my boss (1:27 - 1:31)
listens to the show my boss knews what I (1:29 - 1:33)
was (1:31 - 1:33)
doing like we had the conversation (1:34 - 1:39)
shortly after it was (1:37 - 1:41)
done okay so we're going to talk about (1:39 - 1:44)
the presents today uh and we're just (1:41 - 1:45)
going to go through that I'm sure (1:44 - 1:47)
there's other little bit of Pokemon news (1:45 - 1:49)
that we could be talking about but (1:47 - 1:51)
there's always next week so let's just (1:49 - 1:54)
focus on the presents today and go from (1:51 - 1:55)
there (1:54 - 1:57)
and (1:55 - 1:59)
uh if you haven't watched the presents (1:57 - 2:02)
it's like 13 15 minutes of you I cannot (1:59 - 2:04)
imagine anyone listening to a Pokemon (2:02 - 2:06)
podcast that comes out weekly would not (2:04 - 2:08)
be up to date with the presents maybe (2:06 - 2:09)
you missed it though maybe you missed it (2:08 - 2:10)
and you're just like I'm GNA listen to (2:09 - 2:12)
the show I'm gonna get the news we're (2:10 - 2:13)
going to give you the news we're (2:12 - 2:15)
actually going to start backwards too uh (2:13 - 2:17)
and we're going to talk about the thing (2:15 - 2:19)
that you would think we would have a lot (2:17 - 2:21)
to talk about but we have the least (2:19 - 2:23)
amount of information so we're just (2:21 - 2:25)
going to get Pokemon Legends Za out of (2:23 - 2:27)
the way (2:25 - 2:29)
because let's be frank here they didn't (2:27 - 2:32)
show any gam play they did not (2:29 - 2:35)
definitely not so uh I'll read the press (2:32 - 2:38)
release we'll talk about it you again (2:35 - 2:39)
you would think that we would spend the (2:38 - 2:43)
majority of the episode on this but um (2:39 - 2:45)
it would just be us speculating which (2:43 - 2:46)
I'm sure well we will we will still (2:45 - 2:49)
speculate but uh I have ideas there's (2:46 - 2:52)
literally a paragraph here and that's it (2:49 - 2:54)
it's not even a paragraph it's two (2:52 - 2:59)
sentences uh Pokemon Legends zyphen a I (2:54 - 3:00)
think everyone's just calling it za I (2:59 - 3:02)
don't think we're saying The Hyphen uh (3:00 - 3:05)
ous like pizza yeah Pokemon Pizza is (3:02 - 3:08)
what I'm calling it uh it's an ambitious (3:05 - 3:10)
new entry to the Pokemon video game (3:08 - 3:13)
series will be released worldwide I (3:10 - 3:15)
don't know why they needed to make the (3:13 - 3:17)
every game has been worldwide since X (3:15 - 3:21)
and Y um worldwide on Nintendo switch in (3:17 - 3:24)
2025 an exciting new adventure awaits (3:21 - 3:27)
players within lumos City where an urban (3:24 - 3:29)
Redevelopment plan is underway to shape (3:27 - 3:31)
the city into a place that belongs to (3:29 - 3:34)
both people and Pokemon uh if you want (3:31 - 3:36)
more information and then they have (3:34 - 3:38)
their like little (3:36 - 3:38)
website (3:39 - 3:46)
um so yeah this this was what they ended (3:41 - 3:46)
with the the the zah the zah and it was (3:46 - 3:53)
so exciting yeah let's let's start off (3:51 - 3:55)
with Hannah what what do you got give us (3:53 - 3:57)
give us give us your (3:55 - 3:59)
thoughts I mean I'm just enjoying (3:57 - 4:03)
everybody's enjoyment from it primarily (3:59 - 4:06)
there's a great video up on YouTube of (4:03 - 4:08)
the reaction of everybody who was in (4:06 - 4:12)
Nintendo New York for this announcement (4:08 - 4:13)
and it's (4:12 - 4:16)
just first it shows its game freak then (4:13 - 4:19)
it shows it's not Unova Pokemon it's (4:16 - 4:21)
Callos (4:19 - 4:25)
Pokemon and then you get the Legends and (4:21 - 4:28)
then you get the mega and it's just the (4:25 - 4:30)
and and somewhere in there is 2025 and (4:28 - 4:31)
not (4:30 - 4:34)
2024 yeah and the hype is just growing (4:31 - 4:36)
and growing and growing and the cheers (4:34 - 4:39)
are huge in that video in poke in (4:36 - 4:43)
Nintendo and it's just super exciting (4:39 - 4:46)
I'm very I I need to replay Pokemon X (4:43 - 4:50)
and Y for this is is the hype that game (4:46 - 4:52)
freak came across the screen or is the (4:50 - 4:57)
hype it it didn't say Ila probably the L (4:52 - 5:00)
yes uh they were not chibi (4:57 - 5:03)
yeah well we also don't know what the (5:00 - 5:05)
game is for sure going to look like that (5:03 - 5:09)
was we literally (5:05 - 5:12)
nothing literally there is like here's (5:09 - 5:16)
here's a weird Tron version of the city (5:12 - 5:18)
and we out it was like a blue I wouldn't (5:16 - 5:20)
say Tron I would say like blue blueprint (5:18 - 5:23)
blint no that was clearly they don't (5:20 - 5:25)
have at least as far as I can tell it (5:23 - 5:28)
looks like they don't have a solid art (5:25 - 5:29)
decision on what the game is going to (5:28 - 5:31)
end up looking like yet and so they just (5:29 - 5:34)
didn't want to give any idea Beyond just (5:31 - 5:39)
the like file folder Vibes at the very (5:34 - 5:40)
beginning of the announcement well it (5:39 - 5:43)
says it does say this trailer does not (5:40 - 5:46)
contain actual Gage footage yeah no (5:43 - 5:51)
kidding so we're we're safe there um (5:46 - 5:53)
yeah I I I think the the big question is (5:51 - 5:57)
like we don't know what a Legends game (5:53 - 6:00)
is no because we only got (5:57 - 6:03)
one and so like the first place my head (6:00 - 6:05)
went to (6:03 - 6:10)
was does this have weird pokeballs does (6:05 - 6:11)
it have regular (6:10 - 6:14)
pokeballs are are is it going to do the (6:11 - 6:17)
thing where like these characters like (6:14 - 6:20)
clemont are this is clemont's ancient (6:17 - 6:22)
ancestor or is it going to be like this (6:20 - 6:25)
is clemont's future ancestor right like (6:22 - 6:28)
we don't we don't even know the time (6:25 - 6:30)
zone it's we don't know the time hint at (6:28 - 6:33)
the time zone because lumos this is (6:30 - 6:36)
speculating but it's it's a hint that (6:33 - 6:39)
lead to speculation speculate (6:36 - 6:42)
me the city that that we know that it's (6:39 - 6:46)
going to be based in um lumo city right (6:42 - 6:48)
names are not my strong suit lumio city (6:46 - 6:51)
is based on Paris yes there was a very (6:48 - 6:54)
large significant reconstruction of the (6:51 - 6:57)
City of Paris in the 1800s about the (6:54 - 6:59)
same time frame as what happened in (6:57 - 7:01)
Legends (6:59 - 7:05)
archus is Legends 1800s yep oh in hok (7:01 - 7:07)
though specifically (7:05 - 7:10)
yeah so here's the question I have that (7:07 - 7:14)
hint where in lumio City can we save (7:10 - 7:17)
that won't get our to crash yeah that (7:14 - 7:19)
was my first thought I'm like oh you're (7:17 - 7:21)
really tempting fate with this (7:19 - 7:23)
one (7:21 - 7:25)
so there's a couple of things that I (7:23 - 7:27)
sort of been thinking about what the (7:25 - 7:30)
game could be or what I would be (7:27 - 7:32)
interested in the game based off of the (7:30 - 7:35)
logo so the the fact that it goes Z to A (7:32 - 7:40)
is very specific it suggests going (7:35 - 7:43)
backwards my initial thought of just (7:40 - 7:47)
also looking at the at the logo of the (7:43 - 7:50)
tech in the Z and the plant nature in (7:47 - 7:51)
the (7:50 - 7:54)
a is that there is some aspect of (7:51 - 7:56)
switching between the past and the (7:54 - 7:58)
present where there's a problem in the (7:56 - 8:00)
present and then you're able to go in (7:58 - 8:02)
the past fix it in the past so it's (8:00 - 8:04)
built in a certain way to fix a thing in (8:02 - 8:06)
the present so that the aspect of time (8:04 - 8:10)
travel that exists especially if you are (8:06 - 8:12)
somewhat of a continuation of your (8:10 - 8:16)
character from Legends archus who is (8:12 - 8:18)
from Callos is you're wearing the Callos (8:16 - 8:20)
shirt when you arrive the male character (8:18 - 8:22)
only the male the girls wearing sun and (8:20 - 8:25)
moon so it is possible that there is a (8:22 - 8:26)
connection with that and then you can (8:25 - 8:28)
travel back and forth okay hold on hold (8:26 - 8:29)
on hold on we all thought there was (8:28 - 8:31)
going to be time travel in scarlet and (8:29 - 8:32)
violet that didn't happen that didn't (8:31 - 8:37)
happen no uh this that is just pure like (8:32 - 8:38)
what I would find interesting because (8:37 - 8:40)
you are they have pretty much said it's (8:38 - 8:45)
only within lumo City (8:40 - 8:45)
so what does that look like and what (8:45 - 8:49)
does within mean if it's an urban (8:47 - 8:53)
Redevelopment so keeping that theme I'm (8:49 - 8:56)
like it'd be interesting to me if you (8:53 - 8:59)
were traversing between two time periods (8:56 - 9:02)
to fix (8:59 - 9:02)
problems I like that idea because I want (9:03 - 9:07)
to know more about how they're weaving (9:05 - 9:09)
this (9:07 - 9:11)
Multiverse but I will also point out (9:09 - 9:14)
that the the pattern on the Z in the (9:11 - 9:16)
logo that you were kind of describing as (9:14 - 9:20)
futuristic is zygard SK zygard cells it (9:16 - 9:25)
is is also zygard cell it's just isn't (9:20 - 9:26)
isn't that just a closeup of like the (9:25 - 9:28)
cell the cell form before he gets his (9:26 - 9:33)
scales is it yeah it's it's like squishy (9:28 - 9:35)
I think that's its name in the anime (9:33 - 9:37)
right squishy squishy yeah but there's (9:35 - 9:41)
not a there's no veins inish is the same (9:37 - 9:43)
no squishy is just solid yeah squishy is (9:41 - 9:45)
just solid squishy is (9:43 - 9:48)
solid there there's a lot to think about (9:45 - 9:51)
also so if it is set (9:48 - 9:54)
after so if it's set after the war but (9:51 - 9:57)
before well the war was 3,000 years ago (9:54 - 9:58)
the war was 3,000 years ago so if it's (9:57 - 10:01)
set after the war rebuilding period but (9:58 - 10:03)
before the modern (10:01 - 10:08)
games xerus is a tree and yatel egg they (10:03 - 10:11)
don't come back to life until the things (10:08 - 10:15)
of X and Y they the whole lore of that (10:11 - 10:17)
region is they sacrifice them themselves (10:15 - 10:19)
to be part of the whole stopping the big (10:17 - 10:22)
cannon problem and then they don't you (10:19 - 10:24)
they aren't alive again until you (10:22 - 10:26)
reawaken them in no no no that's not (10:24 - 10:28)
true they're not alive until you run (10:26 - 10:30)
down a hallway battle for four versions (10:28 - 10:33)
of pitbull Mr worldwide and then you (10:30 - 10:35)
awaken them after defeating Lysander (10:33 - 10:38)
wearing a virtual boy for whatever (10:35 - 10:40)
reason because he's (10:38 - 10:44)
cool wearing an apple Vision Pro oh they (10:40 - 10:47)
called it (10:44 - 10:47)
first I I mean some people have been (10:47 - 10:53)
saying that evil tall and xerus are (10:50 - 10:57)
coming back based on the very very very (10:53 - 11:00)
tiny slivers of red and blue that you (10:57 - 11:04)
can see on the hyphen in the logo but I (11:00 - 11:08)
will say Rue is in zygard to zard has (11:04 - 11:09)
red and blue and it's in its final form (11:08 - 11:12)
too there's there's no doubt that zygard (11:09 - 11:15)
and yatel won't be in here (11:12 - 11:17)
somewhere like I I cannot imagine (11:15 - 11:19)
they're GNA make a game without those (11:17 - 11:20)
too (11:19 - 11:23)
yeah what I really want to know is what (11:20 - 11:28)
the the plant pattern in the a is that's (11:23 - 11:31)
my biggest question so I think CU it's (11:28 - 11:32)
not (11:31 - 11:34)
squishy I feel like I remember X and Y (11:32 - 11:36)
pretty well I've played through both of (11:34 - 11:38)
them normally I did a shiny badge quest (11:36 - 11:41)
in one I did an egg lock in the other (11:38 - 11:42)
egg lock is just a nuzlock except people (11:41 - 11:44)
send you eggs like I've played through (11:42 - 11:47)
these games a lot and and relatively (11:44 - 11:49)
recently like I didn't do all of this 10 (11:47 - 11:50)
years ago and then like have these like (11:49 - 11:53)
thick Nostalgia Visions like of like I (11:50 - 11:55)
did I did a lot of this stuff recently (11:53 - 11:57)
and one of the things I do remember is (11:55 - 12:01)
like lumio City in X and Y is also like (11:57 - 12:03)
not fully finished like they're they (12:01 - 12:07)
have like the power outage they like so (12:03 - 12:09)
we need to be able to go into buildings (12:07 - 12:12)
in this game if it's all based in a city (12:09 - 12:14)
there needs to be an inside to the (12:12 - 12:16)
buildings yes there (12:14 - 12:18)
does (12:16 - 12:20)
um I (12:18 - 12:25)
I the one concern I did see on social (12:20 - 12:27)
media and everything is people saying (12:25 - 12:29)
that this might be a small game because (12:27 - 12:32)
it from what the website says and from (12:29 - 12:34)
what the Nintendo Twitter says that the (12:32 - 12:37)
whole game will take place in the city (12:34 - 12:39)
yeah and I don't know why that is a (12:37 - 12:42)
concern for people because a lot of (12:39 - 12:44)
games just focus on one city there's (12:42 - 12:47)
this like really tiny game it got big (12:44 - 12:49)
all of a sudden you you might not have (12:47 - 12:51)
heard of it but it's called Grand Theft (12:49 - 12:53)
Auto and they made a couple of them they (12:51 - 12:56)
made a they made a they made a they made (12:53 - 13:00)
like a Vice City they made a San Andre (12:56 - 13:03)
those games all take place in one city (13:00 - 13:05)
cities are big cities are big they just (13:03 - 13:10)
need to be scaled right um here and like (13:05 - 13:12)
huge like I would love to talk about (13:10 - 13:14)
this in a future episode my my my (13:12 - 13:16)
complaint of like the jotto region and (13:14 - 13:19)
haril silver and golden silver is that (13:16 - 13:22)
jotto is just too small and I feel like (13:19 - 13:24)
it does a disservice to that region and (13:22 - 13:26)
if we were ever to go back to jotto I (13:24 - 13:28)
would like to just I don't want to see (13:26 - 13:30)
Kanto I just want to an expanded fleshed (13:28 - 13:33)
out big Johto so anyways flipping back (13:30 - 13:35)
to (13:33 - 13:38)
Za obviously this game has to be bigger (13:35 - 13:41)
than what you remember just normal lumio (13:38 - 13:44)
City in X and Y lumio City seems to be (13:41 - 13:48)
divided into some very distinct (13:44 - 13:50)
districts uh even in the map there are (13:48 - 13:53)
some pretty distinct lines there are the (13:50 - 13:57)
five plazas that suggests to me at least (13:53 - 14:00)
those will be distinct (13:57 - 14:03)
regions that you are moving into the (14:00 - 14:05)
question is is like is your home based (14:03 - 14:06)
the tower in the center and you're (14:05 - 14:09)
traveling out into them is one of them (14:06 - 14:10)
your home base and then you're traveling (14:09 - 14:12)
to the others like how are they going to (14:10 - 14:14)
use this map but the map is very clearly (14:12 - 14:17)
divided into pizza slices yeah fitting (14:14 - 14:20)
with the zah theme it's got pepperoni on (14:17 - 14:22)
it here's my (14:20 - 14:24)
speculation um that it won't be open (14:22 - 14:28)
world game and it will be like it will (14:24 - 14:30)
be like (14:28 - 14:35)
uh archus where each each pizza slice is (14:30 - 14:37)
what you have to unlock and they can do (14:35 - 14:39)
it very tongue and cheek because when (14:37 - 14:42)
you first get to lumos and you try to go (14:39 - 14:44)
right they're like we have no power over (14:42 - 14:48)
here power over here and so I wonder if (14:44 - 14:51)
you're setting power to each of these (14:48 - 14:54)
regions to then quote unquote open them (14:51 - 14:56)
it could be like it's open world at the (14:54 - 14:58)
very end where like okay you've opened (14:56 - 14:59)
all the pizza slices and now you can go (14:58 - 15:04)
in a complete circle um but I I don't I (14:59 - 15:07)
don't expect you to oh I can go to any (15:04 - 15:09)
pizza slice right off the bat and do it (15:07 - 15:10)
I wonder if (15:09 - 15:14)
it's almost like a clock of opening the (15:10 - 15:15)
the pizza slices one by (15:14 - 15:17)
one because yeah Greg's right it does (15:15 - 15:20)
look very structured (15:17 - 15:20)
off less confusing than lumos (15:20 - 15:28)
was I got I was like I'm just taking a (15:25 - 15:31)
taxi I know the stone store is around (15:28 - 15:35)
here somewhere yeah I'm just G to take a (15:31 - 15:37)
taxi because I cannot be bothered to (15:35 - 15:41)
find it anymore take me to Lysander Cafe (15:37 - 15:46)
I want hot tea and angsty teens please (15:41 - 15:49)
to be fair in games (15:46 - 15:53)
like uh Vice City or in Spider-Man or in (15:49 - 15:54)
inFAMOUS or in any of these games that (15:53 - 15:56)
take place in a city there are parts of (15:54 - 15:58)
the city that are technically blocked (15:56 - 16:01)
off until you complete a mission (15:58 - 16:04)
like some of those games are probably (16:01 - 16:05)
I'm misremembering where you can go (16:04 - 16:07)
there it's just not a lot to do but I I (16:05 - 16:09)
remember specifically in like both (16:07 - 16:11)
Infamous games it's like you have to set (16:09 - 16:13)
it was literally like set power to this (16:11 - 16:16)
part of the city to like open it I (16:13 - 16:18)
forgot Infamous was a game no those (16:16 - 16:19)
games were good they were made by the (16:18 - 16:21)
The Sly Cooper people and those games (16:19 - 16:24)
are also good too The Sly Cooper games I (16:21 - 16:25)
think they's Sly Cooper yeah cuz you can (16:24 - 16:29)
like stand on the the tippy top um (16:25 - 16:32)
the thief the fox Thief that's like (16:29 - 16:34)
Cooper yeah yeah yeah okay that team (16:32 - 16:37)
went on to make Infamous I think they (16:34 - 16:39)
just announced layoffs too unfortunately (16:37 - 16:41)
insomnia I believe is the devil oh yeah (16:39 - 16:43)
yeah yeah yeah yeah they were recently (16:41 - 16:48)
just in the news welcome to layoff (16:43 - 16:50)
land uh (16:48 - 16:53)
2025 that was one of the first things I (16:50 - 16:56)
noticed now I will let's put a little (16:53 - 16:57)
asteris (16:56 - 17:02)
here Ila could be making a (16:57 - 17:02)
game we just know that game freak won't (17:02 - 17:08)
be coming out with a game this year yeah (17:05 - 17:09)
the people are like oh we're skipping (17:08 - 17:14)
over remakes I'm like are we we don't we (17:09 - 17:16)
don't know that for sure because it (17:14 - 17:20)
wasn't announced at this one does not (17:16 - 17:23)
mean it is off it is off the like I I (17:20 - 17:26)
did a huge YouTube video about Pokemon (17:23 - 17:28)
day and how a lot of games aren't (17:26 - 17:30)
actually announced Pokemon (17:28 - 17:32)
yeah sometimes they don't more it feels (17:30 - 17:34)
like they are bringing things into (17:32 - 17:36)
Pokemon day though I will say there was (17:34 - 17:38)
they hyped this up well with a big (17:36 - 17:42)
countdown and they hyped it up and (17:38 - 17:45)
then hit two times speed for the first (17:42 - 17:46)
half of (17:45 - 17:50)
that way too fast I was like when we got (17:46 - 17:52)
to the night part and I'm like there was (17:50 - 17:53)
a (17:52 - 17:57)
coat I I saw it for two seconds I guess (17:53 - 18:00)
I'm going on yeah I will say I did not (17:57 - 18:02)
like the first six minutes of that (18:00 - 18:04)
present every like literally everything (18:02 - 18:06)
they announced could have gotten extra (18:04 - 18:08)
30 seconds to a minute and it would have (18:06 - 18:11)
felt so much better like for Masters (18:08 - 18:14)
they showed silver but barely they (18:11 - 18:16)
showed silver well well they showed (18:14 - 18:19)
silver and uh Tyranitar but like usually (18:16 - 18:21)
for Masters they're like they have a (18:19 - 18:24)
really an good animated cut scene yeah (18:21 - 18:27)
uh and then they'll say like we we did (18:24 - 18:30)
get a a 100 free PE pulls but they never (18:27 - 18:33)
said it in the presents no at all (18:30 - 18:37)
it it was yeah I was just blown away at (18:33 - 18:41)
how super speed that first half was I (18:37 - 18:44)
was just like what is happening right (18:41 - 18:48)
now in in the slack we do uh bingo cards (18:44 - 18:50)
for things like Nintendo directs and (18:48 - 18:52)
Pokemon presents and I had a bingo card (18:50 - 18:54)
in front of me and it was moving way too (18:52 - 18:57)
fast for me to even see if I was hitting (18:54 - 19:00)
any of the squares (18:57 - 19:02)
uh all right let's let's talk about the (19:00 - 19:04)
the elephant in the room here I (19:02 - 19:07)
confidently said for the last couple (19:04 - 19:09)
months that I don't think they would use (19:07 - 19:11)
the word Legends (19:09 - 19:13)
again uh and the reason I said that is (19:11 - 19:14)
because (19:13 - 19:17)
like uh I I thought that like Legends (19:14 - 19:20)
really summed up the CNO region very (19:17 - 19:22)
well because that the everything about (19:20 - 19:25)
so is based around legendary Pokemon and (19:22 - 19:28)
archus uh there's not a whole lot of (19:25 - 19:33)
Legends in in in X and Y but uh I was (19:28 - 19:35)
wrong they're using the word Legends (19:33 - 19:38)
again that being said that begs the (19:35 - 19:40)
question of like what is a Legends game (19:38 - 19:41)
which is what we started off this (19:40 - 19:45)
conversation with I still think that (19:41 - 19:47)
let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee and (19:45 - 19:50)
legends archus are way more similar than (19:47 - 19:53)
people give it credit for and so if we (19:50 - 19:56)
were to carry that over into this game (19:53 - 19:57)
both I think a lot of people forget this (19:56 - 20:00)
but both let's go and both Legends they (19:57 - 20:03)
don't have abilities so are we assuming (20:00 - 20:06)
that Za also doesn't have abilities they (20:03 - 20:09)
don't have held items (20:06 - 20:11)
uh both of those games were focused on (20:09 - 20:14)
catching so are we saying that because (20:11 - 20:16)
this is another Legends game is this (20:14 - 20:19)
also focus on catching and when I say (20:16 - 20:22)
it's in a city yeah uh and when I say (20:19 - 20:23)
focus on (20:22 - 20:26)
catching that like catching is the main (20:23 - 20:29)
goal there are still some battles but (20:26 - 20:31)
very confident that the competitive (20:29 - 20:33)
scene will still stay in scarlet and (20:31 - 20:36)
violet until generation 10 they've (20:33 - 20:38)
already laid pretty good groundwork for (20:36 - 20:39)
why a competitive scene would continue (20:38 - 20:43)
to stay in scarlet and violet um both (20:39 - 20:45)
let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee and and (20:43 - 20:48)
legends archus are new stories placed in (20:45 - 20:50)
places we've already been which is (20:48 - 20:52)
happening right here and then I think a (20:50 - 20:54)
thing that people also forget about (20:52 - 20:56)
those games is both let's go and legends (20:54 - 20:58)
has this weird like level up candy (20:56 - 21:02)
system where you like you put candy to (20:58 - 21:03)
like do (21:02 - 21:06)
EVs and I just like I like never did it (21:03 - 21:07)
in Legends and I remember like my twitch (21:06 - 21:09)
chat being like oh you got to like use (21:07 - 21:11)
the candy before you battle Volo (21:09 - 21:13)
otherwise you're going to lose and like (21:11 - 21:15)
I never put candy into anything in (21:13 - 21:20)
Pikachu or in archus because it was like (21:15 - 21:22)
I'm not struggling and I know putting (21:20 - 21:24)
the candy in would make it easier and (21:22 - 21:26)
that's like that's not a bad thing like (21:24 - 21:27)
I'm sure there are people that are like (21:26 - 21:28)
I don't like battling I just want to go (21:27 - 21:30)
through and like the candy is helping me (21:28 - 21:33)
battle like that's totally cool I just I (21:30 - 21:34)
just remember both of those candy (21:33 - 21:37)
systems being like this is like like I'm (21:34 - 21:39)
glad this is here for some people but (21:37 - 21:40)
like I don't need (21:39 - 21:42)
it um so again is this game going to (21:40 - 21:45)
have like a weird candy (21:42 - 21:48)
system um those are those are a lot of (21:45 - 21:50)
similarities between those games and so (21:48 - 21:52)
it's like are those Sim similari is (21:50 - 21:55)
going to be carried over into this but (21:52 - 21:56)
we don't know because they didn't show (21:55 - 21:58)
any gameplay they just they're just (21:56 - 22:00)
using a word (21:58 - 22:03)
Legends and even so there's not a lot to (22:00 - 22:05)
go (22:03 - 22:09)
off yeah I can't even imagine how we're (22:05 - 22:12)
going to do catching and and training (22:09 - 22:14)
Pokemon in a game that's entirely based (22:12 - 22:18)
in a city we haven't done that (22:14 - 22:22)
before I will say like the city building (22:18 - 22:25)
I don't want to build a building that's (22:22 - 22:27)
it I had like there there's probably (22:25 - 22:29)
other reasons for other people (22:27 - 22:30)
but it's it's the same reason I I don't (22:29 - 22:32)
play fortnite I don't want I don't want (22:30 - 22:35)
to build a tower to like climb up and (22:32 - 22:36)
shoot I just I just don't want to build (22:35 - 22:40)
things and there was crafting in Legends (22:36 - 22:43)
and it was like pretty small it was like (22:40 - 22:45)
you can craft some pokeballs once you (22:43 - 22:47)
got to a certain point you could avoid (22:45 - 22:48)
it completely yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (22:47 - 22:50)
totally and at a certain point I was (22:48 - 22:56)
like I'm done crafting stuff uh but you (22:50 - 22:59)
did technically build a town and legends (22:56 - 23:02)
like like the town got bigger and bigger (22:59 - 23:04)
even though you weren't like collecting (23:02 - 23:07)
20 wood and like 10 Rock like time (23:04 - 23:09)
contributed to the town yeah you (23:07 - 23:12)
contributed but like uh the farm showed (23:09 - 23:14)
up and then the ranch got bigger and (23:12 - 23:17)
then like buildings got and then if what (23:14 - 23:18)
I don't even know how you did it but (23:17 - 23:20)
like the the photography place got more (23:18 - 23:22)
and more like Billboards on it as you (23:20 - 23:27)
went like you did I if if the goal of (23:22 - 23:28)
this game or one of the goals of this (23:27 - 23:31)
game is to like make lumos feel more (23:28 - 23:33)
fleshed out kind of like how you made (23:31 - 23:36)
jubil life feel more fleshed out without (23:33 - 23:39)
saying like go out there and collect 20 (23:36 - 23:43)
wood and 20 Rock and 20 like I think (23:39 - 23:46)
that would be cool but again I don't (23:43 - 23:49)
want to like make my house and then like (23:46 - 23:51)
20 hours in the game like make a bigger (23:49 - 23:55)
house and then like I don't I know (23:51 - 23:58)
that's a popular game style there's a (23:55 - 24:01)
lot of like I know also like survival (23:58 - 24:04)
games are very popular right now but um (24:01 - 24:08)
yeah I'm I'm like even Animal Crossing (24:04 - 24:11)
on the switch was like a little too much (24:08 - 24:15)
crafting and building for me like I can (24:11 - 24:17)
do a little bit until they push a line (24:15 - 24:21)
where it feels yeah like a chore yeah I (24:17 - 24:23)
think that's why there was not as much (24:21 - 24:24)
crafting involved in the happy home (24:23 - 24:26)
designer (24:24 - 24:29)
stuff but I mean I I think we just don't (24:26 - 24:32)
know at this point the weird focus on (24:29 - 24:35)
City development that may or may not be (24:32 - 24:39)
story more than gameplay the fact that (24:35 - 24:42)
it's going to be all in a city and (24:39 - 24:44)
supposedly not out in the wild at all (24:42 - 24:46)
anywhere makes me kind of feel like (24:44 - 24:48)
maybe this will be a totally new and (24:46 - 24:51)
different kind of thing but we don't (24:48 - 24:55)
know yeah I mean (24:51 - 24:55)
it we have not much to base a lot of (24:55 - 25:00)
like we don't even have like gameplay (24:58 - 25:04)
footage to be like we have a weird (25:00 - 25:07)
animated trailer that doesn't even (25:04 - 25:09)
really suggest anything it's like (25:07 - 25:11)
remember this is what lumio city is and (25:09 - 25:15)
there's Pokemon and people in it okay (25:11 - 25:15)
bye yeah it's like um what is the game (25:16 - 25:25)
and it's it is a long way away it is (25:21 - 25:30)
2025 it is this whole year away for them (25:25 - 25:32)
to drip feed what this game actually is (25:30 - 25:32)
I (25:32 - 25:35)
mean am (25:32 - 25:40)
I I'm excited to see what it is um (25:35 - 25:42)
because they are appealing to a game (25:40 - 25:44)
that I really like liked and I thought (25:42 - 25:47)
was a lot of fun which was Legends um so (25:44 - 25:49)
it (25:47 - 25:49)
is exciting in the fact that they are (25:49 - 25:53)
gonna (25:52 - 25:55)
continue that (25:53 - 25:58)
Series in some form because they don't (25:55 - 26:00)
always do that right like they don't (25:58 - 26:02)
always like we've never had another (26:00 - 26:04)
Pokemon Conquest even though I thought (26:02 - 26:06)
that game was great uh we never had (26:04 - 26:10)
another sequel only one game has had a (26:06 - 26:10)
sequel yeah black and white black and (26:10 - 26:18)
white black and white black and white (26:13 - 26:20)
black and white uh like we never got (26:18 - 26:23)
another we got like what two Rangers and (26:20 - 26:25)
then that was done we've had a lot of (26:23 - 26:28)
Mystery Dungeons I don't think any of (26:25 - 26:29)
those count though CU none of those were (26:28 - 26:31)
made by Game Freak (26:29 - 26:34)
true (26:31 - 26:38)
like like the there there was this like (26:34 - 26:40)
group of people online being like wow (26:38 - 26:43)
they broke the pattern like what what (26:40 - 26:44)
have you been living of or a rock like (26:43 - 26:49)
if like like game freak for sure had a (26:44 - 26:52)
pattern up to like gen five and that was (26:49 - 26:54)
the first time they truly broke that (26:52 - 26:56)
pattern which was instead of giving us (26:54 - 26:58)
Pokemon Gray which is when this podcast (26:56 - 27:01)
started and you can go back for $5 and (26:58 - 27:04)
get all 50 episodes on patreon and you (27:01 - 27:07)
can listen to me for for months be like (27:04 - 27:08)
yeah Pokemon Gray is coming because that (27:07 - 27:10)
that was just the thing it was like here (27:08 - 27:12)
are two ver here are two versions here's (27:10 - 27:15)
the third version and they they (27:12 - 27:20)
did black two white two and then we got (27:15 - 27:24)
X and Y and then it was this the same (27:20 - 27:26)
thing for months where Pokemon Z Pokemon (27:24 - 27:28)
Z where's the third version and we just (27:26 - 27:30)
didn't even get anything they just (27:28 - 27:32)
skipped we finally got it they found (27:30 - 27:35)
Pokemon Z they found it underneath the (27:32 - 27:38)
sofa like oh we have to update this and (27:35 - 27:40)
like no one expected us to go to like (27:38 - 27:42)
let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee right (27:40 - 27:44)
like no one expected Legends archus like (27:42 - 27:46)
that I've just named a bunch of so for (27:44 - 27:48)
people to be like they finally broke the (27:46 - 27:51)
pattern they did like 15 years they (27:48 - 27:53)
broke they've broken the pattern for a (27:51 - 27:57)
while I just am happy to see hopefully (27:53 - 28:00)
more in the Legends whatever that like (27:57 - 28:02)
hopefully we'll sort of like be able to (28:00 - 28:04)
establish what a Legends game is when we (28:02 - 28:06)
get to uh of course you need three to be (28:04 - 28:10)
a pattern but uh I'm interested in where (28:06 - 28:13)
they go I feel like for (28:10 - 28:13)
whatever we want to call my rosecolor (28:14 - 28:19)
glasses that they feel they can be more (28:16 - 28:20)
experimental (28:19 - 28:24)
in other out (28:20 - 28:27)
outside the the game like the generation (28:24 - 28:28)
game (28:27 - 28:31)
like I feel like they feel like they can (28:28 - 28:34)
take more risks these the the (28:31 - 28:36)
competition is in outside of the (28:34 - 28:40)
competitive games yeah so excited to see (28:36 - 28:42)
that if you're like split like I don't (28:40 - 28:45)
have a problem with like splitting main (28:42 - 28:48)
series Mario does this already there's (28:45 - 28:51)
there's there's 2D Mario games and there (28:48 - 28:54)
are 3D Mario games and no one I don't (28:51 - 28:55)
know maybe there's some like weird Mario (28:54 - 28:57)
fans that are arguing that one is not (28:55 - 28:58)
main series or they're not but they're (28:57 - 28:59)
they're both main like they're both main (28:58 - 29:03)
series Marios it's just the 2D ones play (28:59 - 29:04)
differently than the 3D ones and some (29:03 - 29:06)
people prefer the 2D ones and some (29:04 - 29:07)
people prefer the 3D ones and then there (29:06 - 29:09)
are Mario fans that will just play (29:07 - 29:12)
everything right so it's not weird to me (29:09 - 29:13)
that (29:12 - 29:16)
like here's a series that may be more (29:13 - 29:19)
focused on catching and more limited in (29:16 - 29:21)
like no breeding also fun fact let's go (29:19 - 29:23)
Pikachu let's goe and legends Aris don't (29:21 - 29:25)
have breeding no breeding like more (29:23 - 29:28)
catching uh like simpler battle system (29:25 - 29:31)
and then over here is a (29:28 - 29:36)
more complicated SL traditional game and (29:31 - 29:38)
like so that that's not weird to me but (29:36 - 29:40)
also at the same time I could see (29:38 - 29:44)
like does generation 10 just kind of (29:40 - 29:46)
change everything cuz it is Generation (29:44 - 29:48)
10 it (29:46 - 29:50)
is (29:48 - 29:53)
like probably going to be their second (29:50 - 29:56)
bestselling like there's as as as long (29:53 - 29:58)
as this game isn't absolute (29:56 - 30:01)
trash and runs at probably more than 15 (29:58 - 30:04)
frames a second I think this sets them (30:01 - 30:08)
up with Goodwill going into a generation (30:04 - 30:10)
10 and kind of erases all of that from (30:08 - 30:14)
scarlet and violet (30:10 - 30:14)
and and the like they nail that (30:15 - 30:21)
Landing the like I was I was wrong about (30:18 - 30:24)
them using the word Legends but I was (30:21 - 30:25)
quot like I guess I'm going to come on (30:24 - 30:27)
here and say like I was right about (30:25 - 30:29)
everything else like I was right as in (30:27 - 30:30)
they were not going to do black and (30:29 - 30:31)
white it was too soon they were not (30:30 - 30:33)
going to do Johto there was not going to (30:31 - 30:35)
be a let's go game I was right that they (30:33 - 30:37)
were going to skip this year and I think (30:35 - 30:38)
that's the most important part they're (30:37 - 30:40)
not skipping this year because like (30:38 - 30:42)
they're scared of like something else (30:40 - 30:44)
they're skipping this year because like (30:42 - 30:47)
gen 10 is still coming yeah and I and if (30:44 - 30:49)
everything they've said everything (30:47 - 30:51)
Nintendo said everything that (30:49 - 30:53)
like has been put out there of like (30:51 - 30:55)
we've heard fans we messed up we don't (30:53 - 30:58)
want to do it again these games feel too (30:55 - 31:02)
rushed so here is they have to put out (30:58 - 31:04)
something before gen 10 to like restore (31:02 - 31:07)
Goodwill yeah so I don't think I for the (31:04 - 31:08)
record I don't think they pivoted I (31:07 - 31:09)
don't think they were like oh man (31:08 - 31:11)
scarlet and violet people are upset (31:09 - 31:13)
quick another Legends game like I'm sure (31:11 - 31:16)
they have their next like five 10 years (31:13 - 31:18)
planned out but they have to do (31:16 - 31:20)
something (31:18 - 31:23)
good but also have enough time to do (31:20 - 31:25)
this and gen 10 which is why they needed (31:23 - 31:27)
to miss a year and this happened to be (31:25 - 31:29)
the year they missed but I mean we' were (31:27 - 31:31)
talking about the fact that if you look (31:29 - 31:32)
at the time (31:31 - 31:37)
frame having gen 10 come out before the (31:32 - 31:40)
30th Anniversary always felt somewhat (31:37 - 31:43)
off right like yeah 10 generation should (31:40 - 31:45)
come out during your big thing so I (31:43 - 31:47)
think we have been talking about and (31:45 - 31:49)
I've been talking about like I've always (31:47 - 31:51)
thought that gen 10 would not be until (31:49 - 31:54)
2026 like that would coincide with their (31:51 - 31:56)
30th anniversary and the question always (31:54 - 31:58)
is what they're G what are they going to (31:56 - 32:00)
fill it with so we have at least one of (31:58 - 32:02)
the one piece of that puzzle this is (32:00 - 32:04)
what they're going to fill it with right (32:02 - 32:06)
they're going to they I think I think it (32:04 - 32:08)
had been a plan for a while to not have (32:06 - 32:11)
gen 10 hit until the 30th Anniversary it (32:08 - 32:15)
is just too good of a lineup to not take (32:11 - 32:19)
advantage of all of that going into the (32:15 - 32:23)
30th so it was Shiny Rayquaza but that (32:19 - 32:25)
dream is still alive Hannah that dream (32:23 - 32:28)
is not going anywhere still exists there (32:25 - 32:33)
is not a a a doubt in my soul that there (32:28 - 32:36)
won't be another legendary 7star raid (32:33 - 32:39)
and that legendary will be Rayquaza they (32:36 - 32:41)
can't do any other Legend well I mean (32:39 - 32:43)
they can they can do a lot of Legends (32:41 - 32:47)
but but Rayquaza is Big Money Rayquaza (32:43 - 32:49)
bringing people back to the game you (32:47 - 32:52)
just we're playing the long Con on that (32:49 - 32:55)
one (32:52 - 32:59)
we but okay so so so so the other thing (32:55 - 33:01)
that I said is like they're not going to (32:59 - 33:04)
have a third DLC and that third DLC is (33:01 - 33:07)
definitely not going to be Callos and I (33:04 - 33:11)
said this for months and the reason I (33:07 - 33:13)
said this is because even because (33:11 - 33:14)
there's two things that maybe three (33:13 - 33:17)
things I would argue with Pokemon but (33:14 - 33:18)
number one (33:17 - 33:23)
is they can sell you Pokemon for $60 (33:18 - 33:26)
simple as that like I know people always (33:23 - 33:27)
joke when like the DLC comes back (33:26 - 33:29)
they're like oh they put Pokemon behind (33:27 - 33:31)
to pay wall the whole game is behind (33:29 - 33:34)
like it's not a free to-play (33:31 - 33:34)
game it's (33:34 - 33:40)
$60 also once the DLC comes out you can (33:37 - 33:41)
just transfer them in from home or you (33:40 - 33:43)
could just trade like they're not held (33:41 - 33:48)
hostage by some like money (33:43 - 33:51)
like you can just trade for them or you (33:48 - 33:53)
can raid for them for free or you can (33:51 - 33:55)
import them from home like it's not a (33:53 - 33:57)
free-to-play game so they can can sell (33:55 - 34:00)
you Pokemon for $60 but they can also (33:57 - 34:03)
sell you a (34:00 - 34:04)
region (34:03 - 34:07)
like I think it's so ironic that like in (34:04 - 34:11)
Pala being very close to Callos which (34:07 - 34:12)
everyone always talks about like that (34:11 - 34:15)
little upper part like are we just also (34:12 - 34:17)
forgetting that Galler is literally like (34:15 - 34:19)
10t away across the ocean like Galler is (34:17 - 34:21)
right there too like it's super close (34:19 - 34:23)
but that being said you're in the Pala (34:21 - 34:25)
region and they take us to Unova and (34:23 - 34:27)
then they take us back to Japan we don't (34:25 - 34:29)
know exactly where in Japan but they do (34:27 - 34:31)
take us to two other regions so if (34:29 - 34:33)
anything if you're if you're raing (34:31 - 34:35)
Pokemon games by how many regions you go (34:33 - 34:37)
to scarland Violet has to be number one (34:35 - 34:39)
it has one more extra region than (34:37 - 34:42)
heartold Soul Silver it has three it's (34:39 - 34:44)
crazy if we're just raking games by (34:42 - 34:47)
regions that's a yeah that's one extra (34:44 - 34:51)
region but even if you were like ah the (34:47 - 34:52)
Callos dream is still alive it's up (34:51 - 34:54)
there in the (34:52 - 34:56)
corner why would they give that to us (34:54 - 34:59)
for $30 and why would you want that for (34:56 - 35:02)
$330 like Kos did kind of get a (34:59 - 35:04)
disservice by not getting a third (35:02 - 35:07)
version 10 years ago so wouldn't you (35:04 - 35:10)
want to go back when they could (35:07 - 35:12)
realistically build it from the ground (35:10 - 35:16)
up and not build it off the whatever the (35:12 - 35:19)
mess of Pala is whatever that engine is (35:16 - 35:22)
that Scarlet Violet is running it ain't (35:19 - 35:26)
good it's not (35:22 - 35:28)
great (35:26 - 35:32)
so I I guess it's like a (35:28 - 35:34)
winwin (35:32 - 35:37)
because we going to getos Callos is (35:34 - 35:38)
going to get redeemed the dream of (35:37 - 35:41)
Callos is still alive and it's not in (35:38 - 35:44)
scarlet and violet and hopefully it's (35:41 - 35:47)
not running at 15 frames a second like (35:44 - 35:49)
that's kind (35:47 - 35:49)
of I know people are like what do you (35:50 - 35:58)
want in Legends Za frame rate frame rate (35:52 - 36:00)
I I want to not fall through the (35:58 - 36:04)
universe it's like please here's here's (36:00 - 36:05)
I think maybe this is the last thing we (36:04 - 36:08)
could talk about before we go to (36:05 - 36:10)
break we don't even know like the (36:08 - 36:13)
starter situation just because Legends (36:10 - 36:15)
picked three starters from other regions (36:13 - 36:18)
which I think was cool does it mean that (36:15 - 36:22)
this game is doing the same it doesn't (36:18 - 36:24)
but I am all here for Mega (36:22 - 36:26)
Superior I've already picked mine I (36:24 - 36:29)
already picked my choices I already I (36:26 - 36:31)
already put my bet down on what I want (36:29 - 36:34)
sniv andos just seems (36:31 - 36:37)
right um none of the X and Y Pokemon are (36:34 - 36:41)
in Legends right (36:37 - 36:43)
rowet (36:41 - 36:46)
aswat and what was the what was the last (36:43 - 36:50)
syil syndic Quil yeah so they didn't (36:46 - 36:53)
even they didn't even like (36:50 - 36:55)
that what's the wording for that it's (36:53 - 36:58)
not like oh (36:55 - 37:00)
the what are the it's not like froi was (36:58 - 37:02)
one of them so be like oh they already (37:00 - 37:03)
used froi and archus so they can't use (37:02 - 37:07)
froi and Za like they didn't use any gen (37:03 - 37:10)
six I like I I just wouldn't be (37:07 - 37:14)
surprised if they're it's just froy (37:10 - 37:17)
fenin (37:14 - 37:21)
Chespin no don't be mean to ches chesin (37:17 - 37:24)
is great and the the in quilin is also (37:21 - 37:27)
great Chestnut chestnut's amazing tiny (37:24 - 37:30)
chestnuts pretty good it's a big armored (37:27 - 37:33)
Paladin there to protect you all right (37:30 - 37:36)
megas we all knew when they would like (37:33 - 37:43)
remake X and Y X2 Y2 XYZ Ultra X Omega y (37:36 - 37:45)
of course they would add new (37:43 - 37:48)
Legends Pokemon Legends archus only had (37:45 - 37:53)
254 Pokemon I think very small Pokedex (37:48 - 37:55)
there's only (37:53 - 37:59)
54 50 six Legends or sorry megas there's (37:55 - 38:03)
not a lot of Megas so 50 some megas out (37:59 - 38:05)
of a thousand (38:03 - 38:08)
Pokemon I would I would I I would be (38:05 - 38:12)
very shocked if they did more than like (38:08 - 38:17)
10 yeah I would not expect very many (38:12 - 38:20)
give me two Pokemon happening give me (38:17 - 38:24)
two Pokemon you want to see get (38:20 - 38:24)
megas I'll start (38:25 - 38:29)
incinerar I'm not Jing possible I think (38:31 - 38:37)
possible I would love a make incin we (38:35 - 38:41)
could finally see incinerar on all fours (38:37 - 38:45)
yeah there we go put a cape on them I'm (38:41 - 38:49)
very into that uh wrestlers love capes (38:45 - 38:53)
um and of course crar an but I don't (38:49 - 38:55)
want the I want the karant to be the (38:53 - 38:58)
same like Kangas scan I just want like (38:55 - 39:01)
whatever's in his mouth to get (38:58 - 39:04)
bigger so like still in his mouth or it (39:01 - 39:06)
pops out like K and fights alongside (39:04 - 39:12)
kraar oh that would be that would be (39:06 - 39:12)
cool (39:13 - 39:18)
um I already said I'm here for Mega (39:15 - 39:21)
Superior I think that would be neat what (39:18 - 39:24)
it do what is just a bigger snake what's (39:21 - 39:26)
happening yeah it's a bigger snake give (39:24 - 39:28)
us a little back it depends on what its (39:26 - 39:29)
second type is going to be cuz they're (39:28 - 39:31)
going to have to give it another type (39:29 - 39:32)
for (39:31 - 39:36)
aega not necessarily have to but but (39:32 - 39:38)
what would you want its second type to (39:36 - 39:42)
be grass what I was convinced by a (39:38 - 39:44)
friend yesterday that grass Ferry would (39:42 - 39:46)
be (39:44 - 39:46)
interesting I don't necessarily see it (39:47 - 39:52)
but I think it would be interesting I (39:50 - 39:54)
mean I want Mega Rose raid where it (39:52 - 39:57)
changes from grass poison to Grass fairy (39:54 - 40:00)
yeah because it is part of the fairy egg (39:57 - 40:02)
group okay hear me out Mega karant but (40:00 - 40:06)
it changes from water to Grass fairy no (40:02 - 40:09)
that destroys the essence of (40:06 - 40:14)
karant how dare you okay what's I you I (40:09 - 40:16)
said two so I got the second one I would (40:14 - 40:18)
like to see is I would like to see Mega (40:16 - 40:22)
Del Fox I like Del Fox's design a lot I (40:18 - 40:25)
would like to see it leap from the sort (40:22 - 40:27)
of magy witchy thing into something (40:25 - 40:30)
bigger beier wi year is it is it not (40:27 - 40:34)
weird I think I no I'm going to say (40:30 - 40:36)
everyone has to be in agreement here (40:34 - 40:39)
it's very weird that the Gen six (40:36 - 40:41)
starters did not get Megas in the game (40:39 - 40:44)
that introduced megas oh yeah no that (40:41 - 40:45)
was like (40:44 - 40:48)
huh and they never got them they never (40:45 - 40:49)
got them and they never will because (40:48 - 40:50)
they're not going to get up in this one (40:49 - 40:52)
either they could I don't know I don't (40:50 - 40:54)
know I feel (40:52 - 40:56)
like I think they stay on the shelf (40:54 - 40:59)
forever has a middle finger to everybody (40:56 - 41:03)
who wants them well okay so like gen 3 (40:59 - 41:08)
has megas MH gen one has megas (41:03 - 41:12)
gen eight has (41:08 - 41:12)
Dynamax gen six has nothing gen two has (41:15 - 41:24)
synic quill in a different (41:20 - 41:27)
Evolution Regional form Regional so gen (41:24 - 41:30)
two Gen (41:27 - 41:34)
5 and gen 7 gen one has everything yeah (41:30 - 41:36)
gen one has everything but Gen 6 has (41:34 - 41:38)
nothing that's what I'm saying gen six (41:36 - 41:40)
has nothing at least gen two has one (41:38 - 41:42)
Pokemon that has one thing the same for (41:40 - 41:45)
Gen five the same for Gen seven but gen (41:42 - 41:47)
six has (41:45 - 41:51)
nothing shut out neither does gen four (41:47 - 41:53)
and and it still doesn't have anything (41:51 - 41:55)
[Music] (41:53 - 41:58)
four (41:55 - 41:58)
yeah no Gigan Max no mega no Regional (41:59 - 42:03)
forms and we just yeah but we got we got (42:01 - 42:06)
enough Gen 4 they got two games in a (42:03 - 42:09)
year we got enough Gen 4 we don't need (42:06 - 42:11)
I'm just saying this argument doesn't (42:09 - 42:13)
necessarily hold even Gen 4 fans are (42:11 - 42:15)
like we got too much 4 I don't want to (42:13 - 42:18)
see another sh in my life not like this (42:15 - 42:22)
please not like this please not like (42:18 - 42:26)

[Laughter] (42:37 - 42:41)
week Hannah what was your last Mega (42:39 - 42:45)
before we break uh first one that pops (42:41 - 42:47)
to mind is Mega pyro because I think it (42:45 - 42:51)
deserves better okay I could see that (42:47 - 42:53)
does it change its (42:51 - 42:56)
normalist like I said it deserves better (42:53 - 42:57)
so prob (42:56 - 43:01)
I mean that's good it can't be hurt by (42:57 - 43:05)
ghosts fair but it could be (43:01 - 43:09)

break and we'll talk about I think (43:21 - 43:28)
pocket the new mobile app they announced (43:25 - 43:29)
is actually the most exciting thing (43:28 - 43:31)
because we actually know what it is and (43:29 - 43:32)
that's why I think it's the most (43:31 - 43:34)
exciting thing so we'll be we'll talk (43:32 - 43:35)
about it the same speed that they didn't (43:34 - 43:37)
in thing so it'll be about two minutes (43:35 - 43:40)

plus that lets you get Gloria in the (45:18 - 45:24)
smooching Lodge so you kind of you get (45:21 - 45:26)
you get more you get more for that one (45:24 - 45:29)
you do with the other ones um there's a (45:26 - 45:32)
new Champion the whole G story line is (45:29 - 45:36)
there's a new story line um which is (45:32 - 45:38)
pretty fun does it have anything to do (45:36 - 45:42)
with Pala nope I (45:38 - 45:45)
mean GA is an interesting character that (45:42 - 45:47)
I think they could have gone into more (45:45 - 45:51)
but if they don't her reason for being (45:47 - 45:54)
there is based off of her position in (45:51 - 45:56)
Pala and they talk about it but it (45:54 - 46:01)
doesn't expand on pdea's anything other (45:56 - 46:03)
than she's like hey I found my way here (46:01 - 46:04)
and by the (46:03 - 46:07)
way I'm better than all of (46:04 - 46:10)
you so that's my (46:07 - 46:12)
deal (46:10 - 46:14)
um they really they really missed an (46:12 - 46:17)
opportunity here with I feel like (46:14 - 46:20)
there's been several Pokemon days where (46:17 - 46:22)
they have this really well animated (46:20 - 46:24)
trailer and then people are like oh my (46:22 - 46:27)
gosh Gen 4 confirmed or gen 3 confirmed (46:24 - 46:29)
and then it's it it just ends up saying (46:27 - 46:32)
Pokemon Masters at the end and I thought (46:29 - 46:35)
because we had the because how how (46:32 - 46:37)
mobile games work that once the update (46:35 - 46:39)
is pushed people are like this is what's (46:37 - 46:41)
coming and so when I saw silver and (46:39 - 46:44)
Tyranitar coming I'm like oh so the the (46:41 - 46:45)
present is going to have like a (46:44 - 46:47)
30-second trailer and then people are (46:45 - 46:49)
going to think that this is like a (46:47 - 46:51)
sequel to jotto and then it's going to (46:49 - 46:54)
say Pokemon Masters at the end but they (46:51 - 46:55)
didn't already thought that because of (46:54 - 46:58)
all the unknown throughout the (46:55 - 47:01)
present that's true I always laugh (46:58 - 47:03)
because they're like unknowns I'm like (47:01 - 47:05)
it's their it's how they spell things (47:03 - 47:07)
it's their alphabet the only thing that (47:05 - 47:10)
is still confusing is what what it meant (47:07 - 47:11)
at the (47:10 - 47:13)
end it was just CU you it was just (47:11 - 47:15)
jumbled up because if you go back to the (47:13 - 47:17)
first one where it says Pokemon presents (47:15 - 47:18)
it was also jumbled it didn't actually (47:17 - 47:21)
spell it properly but I don't know I (47:18 - 47:24)
think unknown just can't spell yeah I (47:21 - 47:26)
think I think that's the real take away (47:24 - 47:28)
from this presents yeah Pokemon don't (47:26 - 47:30)
how to spell words they they use that as (47:28 - 47:33)
their in-game alphabet it gen it doesn't (47:30 - 47:35)
mean anything anymore uh Masters I think (47:33 - 47:37)
Masters there's just a lot to do in (47:35 - 47:39)
Masters right now so if you want to jump (47:37 - 47:40)
back in you're getting a ton of stuff (47:39 - 47:42)
for free there's a lot of story lines (47:40 - 47:45)
happening right now you can get Riley (47:42 - 47:47)
and Lucario for free you can get a bunch (47:45 - 47:51)
of good SN pairs for free plus a lot of (47:47 - 47:53)
polls so if you just want to collect (47:51 - 47:55)
some people and then take pictures of (47:53 - 47:58)
them and their outfits I'm log you can (47:55 - 48:02)
do that now at your at at your leisure (47:58 - 48:06)
there's a lot to do that is just fluff (48:02 - 48:08)
like it's just like okay I get to play (48:06 - 48:10)
with things in this because it still has (48:08 - 48:13)
nothing to do with battling um although (48:10 - 48:15)
that did you get their email that's like (48:13 - 48:17)
if you want a super exciting battling (48:15 - 48:20)
game play Pokemon Masters I don't think (48:17 - 48:23)
I got that e oh I I got I got on both my (48:20 - 48:24)
accounts it was something about (48:23 - 48:27)
strategic if you're looking strategic (48:24 - 48:30)
battle single player experience Pokemon (48:27 - 48:33)
Masters I'm like what is going on I (48:30 - 48:34)
don't know my Pokemon of the day that (48:33 - 48:36)
popped up was electrode (48:34 - 48:40)
so that's that's still (48:36 - 48:40)
happening um Silver's outfit looks (48:41 - 48:46)
incredible looks very very good oh yeah (48:44 - 48:48)
it's his neoch Champion outfit so I (48:46 - 48:50)
guess I guess we didn't talk about this (48:48 - 48:53)
in the like 45 minutes we spent talking (48:50 - 48:56)
about Za uh which is much longer than (48:53 - 49:00)
anything they showed us is that there's (48:56 - 49:02)
like I guess there's two conversations (49:00 - 49:07)
here the first conversation is (49:02 - 49:07)
how every (49:07 - 49:13)
single quote unquote leaker or data (49:09 - 49:16)
Miner or YouTuber who covers leaks and (49:13 - 49:19)
stuff were just wrong and they were all (49:16 - 49:21)
like desperately trying to (49:19 - 49:23)
backpedal on Pokemon day of like no it (49:21 - 49:26)
was Kos all along except they were all (49:23 - 49:28)
saying like third DLCs or let's go jto (49:26 - 49:30)
or black and white 3 right like they (49:28 - 49:32)
were all just wrong and it it is like (49:30 - 49:34)
frustrating (49:32 - 49:37)
as me hosting the (49:34 - 49:44)
show of like trying to like point out (49:37 - 49:47)
that they're wrong a lot of the (49:44 - 49:49)
times like they are there are some (49:47 - 49:51)
things they were right about for sure (49:49 - 49:52)
like (49:51 - 49:55)
like broken clock is right twice a day (49:52 - 49:59)
but the (49:55 - 49:59)
digital yeah you make a good point (49:59 - 50:04)
Greg then it just broken and it's never (50:02 - 50:08)
right because it do work but it it's so (50:04 - 50:11)
it's it's like the amount of people that (50:08 - 50:13)
just believed that this was going to (50:11 - 50:15)
happen because of (50:13 - 50:18)
those megaphones that they have is a (50:15 - 50:20)
little frustrating because then of (50:18 - 50:22)
course they're they're wrong and then (50:20 - 50:24)
they're upset and (50:22 - 50:27)
then it's it's like this weird like (50:24 - 50:30)
social like social like media literacy (50:27 - 50:32)
is already at like an all-time low Y and (50:30 - 50:34)
then you just have people saying like I (50:32 - 50:36)
know for sure I was right about this and (50:34 - 50:38)
then like that stuff doesn't happen so (50:36 - 50:40)
it's like and then the other part of the (50:38 - 50:43)
conversation is like which I think goes (50:40 - 50:45)
really hand inhand with that first part (50:43 - 50:48)
is like look at all of these references (50:45 - 50:51)
so it has to be this and I remember when (50:48 - 50:54)
I when Nintendo flew me out to play the (50:51 - 50:56)
DLC and I actually never talked about (50:54 - 50:58)
this because I (50:56 - 51:01)
I I don't cuz I I I felt like if I if I (50:58 - 51:03)
brought it up like people would like (51:01 - 51:05)
shrug it off but when the Nintendo rep (51:03 - 51:08)
sat me down and she was like she (51:05 - 51:11)
literally said this well for those that (51:08 - 51:12)
maybe missed that (51:11 - 51:15)
episode Nintendo reps like to not give (51:12 - 51:19)
you any answers to anything so when I'm (51:15 - 51:23)
like uh how big is this area compared to (51:19 - 51:25)
kakami and the the answer is like yeah (51:23 - 51:28)
you got to find out on your own or I'll (51:25 - 51:31)
be like how many like new Pokemon are (51:28 - 51:33)
you going to bring back you got to find (51:31 - 51:36)
out on it's always like it's always like (51:33 - 51:39)
wait and see but when I sat down (51:36 - 51:43)
unprompted she said hey there's a lot of (51:39 - 51:46)
references to old games here they're (51:43 - 51:47)
just (51:46 - 51:50)
references and I still think that like (51:47 - 51:52)
Pokemon fans can't get that out of their (51:50 - 51:55)
head where like this entire franchise (51:52 - 51:58)
just plays to Nostalgia so when you go (51:55 - 52:00)
to an area like the blueberry Academy (51:58 - 52:02)
and people are like oh my gosh this like (52:00 - 52:05)
lacy is Clay's (52:02 - 52:08)
daughter yeah you're in yova that why (52:05 - 52:11)
that doesn't mean that gen five remakes (52:08 - 52:15)
are coming like there there were like so (52:11 - 52:17)
many things in like Callos that were (52:15 - 52:18)
just like gen one references like the (52:17 - 52:21)
forest the very first Forest you walk (52:18 - 52:23)
through in Kanto is literally vidiian (52:21 - 52:25)
forests it's just not called vidian (52:23 - 52:27)
course I can't remember what it's called (52:25 - 52:29)
that doesn't mean that (52:27 - 52:32)
like Kanto remakes are around the corner (52:29 - 52:35)
I mean they are we know and this isn't (52:32 - 52:37)
something that just happens in Pokemon (52:35 - 52:40)
when an Easter egg legitimately happens (52:37 - 52:42)
once people are going to look for it (52:40 - 52:45)
forever just like when there was an item (52:42 - 52:48)
in the trash can in one of the games a (52:45 - 52:51)
very very long time ago people are going (52:48 - 52:54)
to check every single trash there's (52:51 - 52:57)
going to be something in there the trash (52:54 - 53:00)
can but like that that goes back to the (52:57 - 53:02)
unknown is like the unknown came on (53:00 - 53:03)
screen so people are like oh my gosh Jen (53:02 - 53:06)
to and it was like that's their alphabet (53:03 - 53:08)
that's how they spell things the the (53:06 - 53:11)
issue is is that companies play with (53:08 - 53:15)
that a lot right like they deliberately (53:11 - 53:18)
put in things that are meaningful and (53:15 - 53:21)
things that aren't and like to use (53:18 - 53:24)
people's speculation and Natural (53:21 - 53:27)
Curiosity for both good and evil right (53:24 - 53:30)
like as long as you're talking about the (53:27 - 53:31)
game they don't (53:30 - 53:34)
care how right or wrong you are how much (53:31 - 53:36)
you read into something or how much you (53:34 - 53:38)
didn't read into something the whole (53:36 - 53:42)
point was to get you talking so (53:38 - 53:45)
when Janine showed up was it Janine who (53:42 - 53:47)
showed up on the beach in one of them (53:45 - 53:49)
and you're like why are you here I think (53:47 - 53:53)
it's in um isn't it in Diamond pearl (53:49 - 53:54)
she's on the beach before you go to (53:53 - 53:57)
Victory Road and you're like why are you (53:54 - 54:00)
here because she exists in the world (53:57 - 54:02)
right like sometimes what they do and I (54:00 - 54:04)
appreciate is they're trying to make the (54:02 - 54:07)
world feel like people move around it (54:04 - 54:10)
and a region locked but also sometimes (54:07 - 54:12)
they're like wink wink did you see we (54:10 - 54:14)
put her that's because we were secretly (54:12 - 54:16)
telling you this and you never know (54:14 - 54:18)
which is which right like like Grim (54:16 - 54:21)
Grimsley is like the surf master in Sun (54:18 - 54:23)
and Moon he's like the best surfer in (54:21 - 54:24)
the entire world which is really funny (54:23 - 54:26)
cuz that man shops at hot top and (54:24 - 54:30)
like gam he gambles all his money away (54:26 - 54:31)
top to bottom and then he's like the (54:30 - 54:33)
surf M but that didn't mean like black (54:31 - 54:35)
and white were also coming like it's not (54:33 - 54:37)
bad I literally just said like Masters (54:35 - 54:39)
usually like trolls us with like showing (54:37 - 54:42)
a character to make everyone think like (54:39 - 54:45)
like I think I think Greg's 100% right (54:42 - 54:48)
where they they they do use (54:45 - 54:50)
references I don't want to say (54:48 - 54:52)
ill-intentioned but they know like oh if (54:50 - 54:53)
we put a if we put something here there (54:52 - 54:55)
people are going to talk about it even (54:53 - 54:56)
though (54:55 - 55:00)
it's just like we're just using our our (54:56 - 55:04)
Archive of nostalgia like what part what (55:00 - 55:05)
part of nostalgia can we sprinkle in (55:04 - 55:08)
this region or what part of nostalgia (55:05 - 55:10)
can we sprinkle at the end of this alley (55:08 - 55:12)
and it's it's again I think it was the (55:10 - 55:15)
combination of like the Nostalgia being (55:12 - 55:17)
sprinkled yeah and then data M or (55:15 - 55:21)
leakers being like I know for sure that (55:17 - 55:24)
yeah jotto is the next game and it does (55:21 - 55:26)
it happens in the Star Wars Community it (55:24 - 55:30)
happens in happens all over the place it (55:26 - 55:32)
happens in the Disney Community people (55:30 - 55:34)
will show up in the background and (55:32 - 55:38)
they're gonna oh blah blah blah (55:34 - 55:40)
like people who make these games also (55:38 - 55:42)
like to have fun and will sometimes put (55:40 - 55:44)
things in there that make them laugh (55:42 - 55:48)
right I wrote an entire book for Simon (55:44 - 55:51)
and Shuster and I have like four Pokemon (55:48 - 55:53)
references hidden in there so if you (55:51 - 55:54)
look for them you will find them they in (55:53 - 55:56)
there because I love the series and I (55:54 - 55:58)
could put them in there it doesn't mean (55:56 - 56:01)
that I'm writing a Pokemon book right (55:58 - 56:04)
but one of the things I think as part of (56:01 - 56:08)
the media literacy commentary (56:04 - 56:11)
is people sort (56:08 - 56:15)
of inability to keep perspective as to (56:11 - 56:19)
what is actually (56:15 - 56:22)
possible and also manage their (56:19 - 56:25)
expectations that they aren't crushed (56:22 - 56:27)
when the thing that they imagined in (56:25 - 56:30)
their brain didn't come true like it's (56:27 - 56:32)
fun to speculate like I can talk about (56:30 - 56:35)
what I want for Z and a but I know full (56:32 - 56:38)
force I have no control over that game (56:35 - 56:40)
these are things that I would (56:38 - 56:43)
like they probably won't happen right (56:40 - 56:46)
like I have to (56:43 - 56:49)
keep I mean but I have to keep my own (56:46 - 56:53)
levels of (56:49 - 56:53)
expectations in check so they don't (56:53 - 57:00)
unfairly judge something against what I (56:56 - 57:03)
thought it was going to be right like (57:00 - 57:06)
things deserve to be judged on the Merit (57:03 - 57:09)
of what they chose to present not what (57:06 - 57:12)
you expected them to (57:09 - 57:12)
present challenge Venus or Charizard and (57:16 - 57:21)
Blastoise and terot (57:19 - 57:23)
raids so I know I thought Greg made a (57:21 - 57:24)
good point I didn't have anything else (57:23 - 57:26)
to add (57:24 - 57:29)
I'm already yapped enough I challenged (57:26 - 57:33)
Venusaur with a big pink dog uh the (57:29 - 57:35)
Pokemon video game series kicked off 28 (57:33 - 57:38)
years ago when red and green were (57:35 - 57:41)
released in Japan on February 27th (57:38 - 57:46)
1996 uh you can celebrate by um by (57:41 - 57:48)
battling Venusaur with the ground type (57:46 - 57:50)
Tera that will run until if you're (57:48 - 57:52)
listening to this on Monday that ends on (57:50 - 57:56)
Tuesday night uh and then Blastoise with (57:52 - 57:58)
the Steel type terara will go for a week (57:56 - 58:00)
and then Charizard with the dragon type (57:58 - 58:01)
Tera will (58:00 - 58:04)
return and will not be a full week I (58:01 - 58:05)
think it's actually only like five days (58:04 - 58:07)
for Charizard but this is our first (58:05 - 58:10)
sevenstar repeat I (58:07 - 58:13)
do I do expect some of these Seven Stars (58:10 - 58:16)
to repeat so if you missed like a deui (58:13 - 58:19)
or Del Fox I do I do expect them to (58:16 - 58:22)
eventually come back (58:19 - 58:24)
it's part of the reason why I was like (58:22 - 58:27)
so confident of like not seeing a game (58:24 - 58:32)
this year was one as we record this (58:27 - 58:36)
podcast the Pala anime is still not out (58:32 - 58:39)
in the United States they are not they (58:36 - 58:42)
haven't they're not done with pal a week (58:39 - 58:44)
there's less than a week until it's out (58:42 - 58:46)
it's March 7th they're still not done (58:44 - 58:49)
with Pala but whether or not you hate (58:46 - 58:51)
scarlet and violet or like scarlet and (58:49 - 58:55)
violet or scarlet and violet has these (58:51 - 58:56)
amount of issues which is all true I'm (58:55 - 58:58)
not going to disagree with anyone they (58:56 - 59:01)
did set up scarlet and violet to be a (58:58 - 59:04)
longterm game like we're going to see (59:01 - 59:06)
every single starter in sevenstar raids (59:04 - 59:08)
and we're probably going to see other (59:06 - 59:12)
non starters like iron bundle or Mewtwo (59:08 - 59:14)
or Pikachu or Eevee like appear in seven (59:12 - 59:17)
star raids they like you you might hate (59:14 - 59:20)
raids but that doesn't mean and which is (59:17 - 59:22)
fine but that doesn't mean they they (59:20 - 59:25)
they are not prepared for the next what (59:22 - 59:27)
the game the game is like 16 months old (59:25 - 59:30)
at this point 15 months old and if this (59:27 - 59:32)
game is to last three years like most (59:30 - 59:34)
main Series games we (59:32 - 59:38)
have another 18 more months to (59:34 - 59:40)
go (59:38 - 59:43)
and I expect all the starters I expect (59:40 - 59:45)
another legendary to show up like I (59:43 - 59:47)
expect them to keep doing that I also (59:45 - 59:48)
expect them to keep doing outbreaks (59:47 - 59:50)
which there was no well they didn't (59:48 - 59:51)
outbreak before Pokemon day which was (59:50 - 59:57)
the Pokeball outbreak um but yeah like (59:51 - 59:57)
who would have guessed that the epilogue (59:57 - 60:03)
the thing that means the ending was (60:00 - 60:06)
actually the (60:03 - 60:06)
ending to that (60:06 - 60:09)
game the epilog was the ending anyways (60:10 - 60:17)
um so I I would expect the lifespan of (60:15 - 60:19)
scarlet and violet to be continued with (60:17 - 60:21)
sevenstar raids and five-star raids (60:19 - 60:24)
continue with the mass outbreaks and (60:21 - 60:26)
continued with like a competitive scene (60:24 - 60:27)
now if you don't (60:26 - 60:30)
like if you don't like outbreaks and you (60:27 - 60:32)
don't like battles and you don't like (60:30 - 60:34)
raids then the game is done for you (60:32 - 60:37)
that's it like the the story is done but (60:34 - 60:38)
I think as (60:37 - 60:44)
like a game with no monthly cost a game (60:38 - 60:47)
with no microtransactions a game that (60:44 - 60:49)
ultimately you buy once plus the DLC you (60:47 - 60:52)
buy once I think that's really healthy (60:49 - 60:54)
and good for a game to like continue to (60:52 - 61:00)
be reported this long after release and (60:54 - 61:02)
I don't think there's anything wrong (61:00 - 61:07)
with not having a game this year when (61:02 - 61:09)
they're continuing to add content (61:07 - 61:10)
literally like every two weeks in this (61:09 - 61:12)
game like it feels like if it's if it's (61:10 - 61:14)
not if it's not a (61:12 - 61:16)
tournament then it's an outbreak if it's (61:14 - 61:20)
not an outbreak it's a sevenstar raid if (61:16 - 61:22)
you've already done the sevenstar raid (61:20 - 61:24)
well cool we're bringing back Blissey (61:22 - 61:25)
the following weeks so you can at least (61:24 - 61:27)
grind candy like I think they've done a (61:25 - 61:30)
really good job at that now this wasn't (61:27 - 61:32)
the Rayquaza I wanted but I still think (61:30 - 61:35)
the Rayquaza is coming come on plus (61:32 - 61:36)
these rids have (61:35 - 61:39)
herba yes I'm curious if Blastoise will (61:36 - 61:41)
also have (61:39 - 61:43)
herba um because I could see them (61:41 - 61:45)
switching it up and being like Blastoise (61:43 - 61:48)
drops bottle caps like more often than (61:45 - 61:50)
not because I don't know bottle caps are (61:48 - 61:53)
like metal it's a Steel type I mean we (61:50 - 61:56)
are at the end sort of so that's when (61:53 - 61:58)
they start loosening up what they give (61:56 - 62:00)
away for free so I'm not surprised that (61:58 - 62:04)
they're be like okay hereba here's some (62:00 - 62:05)
herba so that you can shiny hunt here's (62:04 - 62:08)
stuff to do to fill in the the lengthy (62:05 - 62:12)
time between the next one and it's no we (62:08 - 62:14)
no longer have much of a interest in (62:12 - 62:15)
keeping (62:14 - 62:18)
it so tightly (62:15 - 62:20)
controlled it was funny cuz when I was (62:18 - 62:24)
doing that Pokemon Day video I was was (62:20 - 62:28)
one year for Sun and Moon their like (62:24 - 62:30)
prize to go to GameStop was a single (62:28 - 62:33)
bottle cap not a gold bottle cap just a (62:30 - 62:37)
single bottle cap was like go to (62:33 - 62:39)
GameStop to celebrate Pokemon day and (62:37 - 62:42)
get your one bottle (62:39 - 62:44)
cap and now I'm pretty sure you can just (62:42 - 62:46)
buy bottle caps in scarlet and violet (62:44 - 62:48)
like there's a like I think the deli (62:46 - 62:50)
bird store just sells a bottle cap for (62:48 - 62:52)
$20,000 you can also get them real (62:50 - 62:56)
easily in the item printer yeah yeah (62:52 - 62:58)
but back in Sun and Moon you're like oh (62:56 - 63:02)
man that's so rare I'm gonna go talk to (62:58 - 63:04)
this person to get a bottle cap I need (63:02 - 63:06)
that bottle cap I'm curious if they do (63:04 - 63:08)
anything with Charizard it see it we (63:06 - 63:10)
know for sure you can only catch one per (63:08 - 63:12)
se file that they they did state that (63:10 - 63:14)
but I am curious if Charizard will have (63:12 - 63:17)
the same exact move set or do the same (63:14 - 63:19)
exact thing because I do feel like they (63:17 - 63:20)
they've learned a lot with seven star (63:19 - 63:22)
raids and how players (63:20 - 63:25)
play um also we have like a lot of cool (63:22 - 63:26)
Pokemon (63:25 - 63:29)
that would feel like it would do way (63:26 - 63:31)
better against Charizard that we thought (63:29 - 63:33)
14 months ago like I think Fez andity (63:31 - 63:35)
would be really good against Charizard (63:33 - 63:37)
because it's fairy type and it gets (63:35 - 63:39)
access to acid spray so it just would (63:37 - 63:41)
accelerate that raid way way quicker (63:39 - 63:44)
feend Dippity wasn't a thing 16 months (63:41 - 63:46)
ago it's also (63:44 - 63:49)
cool um so that was that was your that (63:46 - 63:51)
was the scarland Violet news with that (63:49 - 63:54)
um and then Pokemon unite they did a (63:51 - 63:57)
officially announce suru (63:54 - 64:02)
Edge coming at a later date um maridon (63:57 - 64:04)
again this feels like this unite thing (64:02 - 64:07)
could have been like 90 seconds but they (64:04 - 64:09)
were like here is 20 seconds we got to (64:07 - 64:11)
move we got to hustle we got to hustle I (64:09 - 64:12)
was like I don't know why they were (64:11 - 64:14)
hustling so fast and there was a code in (64:12 - 64:17)
there I was like I want that code (64:14 - 64:19)
please it's poke day (64:17 - 64:21)
24 (64:19 - 64:24)
uh also unit's in a bad spot again so (64:21 - 64:28)
the Maron Maron is so good is as bad as (64:24 - 64:32)
expected um (64:28 - 64:37)
just to be clear the ex ban is both (64:32 - 64:39)
seasonal so it will be banned and not (64:37 - 64:42)
banned depending on what they want to do (64:39 - 64:44)
also the band Only kicks in in Masters (64:42 - 64:46)
anyways because you would still run into (64:44 - 64:50)
them all all the way up to there (64:46 - 64:52)
um the question on everybody's there's a (64:50 - 64:54)
couple of things that sort of upset me (64:52 - 64:57)
about I that we're back in Mewtwo and (64:54 - 65:00)
zashi and land again (64:57 - 65:03)
is it's overpowered which means the next (65:00 - 65:05)
two releases are going to be judged (65:03 - 65:08)
against how overpowered maridon is and (65:05 - 65:11)
two very cool looking interesting play (65:08 - 65:14)
styles are going to be trashed because (65:11 - 65:16)
they aren't I'm halfway across the map (65:14 - 65:19)
and I can just blow everybody up with (65:16 - 65:24)
lightning um Maron is way overpowered as (65:19 - 65:26)
as is their want despite them saying (65:24 - 65:27)
they're going to keep it control they (65:26 - 65:29)
never do that at release that's how they (65:27 - 65:31)
that's how they sell those Li that's how (65:29 - 65:32)
they get people back (65:31 - 65:35)
in um it will probably be fixed (65:32 - 65:40)
hopefully on a faster turnaround time (65:35 - 65:40)
but if you find the legendary dominance (65:40 - 65:47)
and always because right now it is very (65:45 - 65:49)
likely that you'll run into a team of (65:47 - 65:53)
Mewtwo zachian and maridon and it is (65:49 - 65:56)
just sounds like Pokemon Showdown yeah I (65:53 - 65:59)
mean it is just it is just a miserable (65:56 - 66:01)
experience right like from top to bottom (65:59 - 66:04)
that that is going to be a miserable (66:01 - 66:07)
time um even if they are bad at playing (66:04 - 66:10)
those characters they are so overpowered (66:07 - 66:13)
if you see a comfy or Blissey Alo Just (66:10 - 66:15)
Surrender at the five minute Mark save (66:13 - 66:19)
yourself some sanity um I'm I again I'm (66:15 - 66:21)
not I don't think unite's in a good (66:19 - 66:23)
place right now um I think it will get (66:21 - 66:27)
back there it maridon (66:23 - 66:31)
is I I don't find the game play (66:27 - 66:36)
that interesting it it just is like a (66:31 - 66:40)
bunch of the other legendaries (66:36 - 66:42)
overpowered it does things that other (66:40 - 66:44)
things can do just souped up to a (66:42 - 66:48)
thousand um I'm hoping that unite will (66:44 - 66:51)
get back in alignment faster but it took (66:48 - 66:52)
at least two months for Mewtwo to get (66:51 - 66:55)
into some form of balance and balance (66:52 - 66:57)
was we're making it ex and it's going to (66:55 - 67:03)
be banned sometimes um so I I cannot say (66:57 - 67:04)
go back to youit I'm still playing it (67:03 - 67:07)
I'm still fighting also the sparkle (67:04 - 67:09)
spray (67:07 - 67:09)
is (67:09 - 67:15)
sparkly I used it I used it once I (67:12 - 67:18)
wanted to see I have weird glitter that (67:15 - 67:20)
makes it look like my camera's doused in (67:18 - 67:23)
Vaseline because it makes other people (67:20 - 67:25)
see your sparkle spray (67:23 - 67:27)
huh when you Sparkle spray do other (67:25 - 67:30)
people see it yeah you see it on the map (67:27 - 67:32)
they see your glistening yeah they see (67:30 - 67:34)
you they see you shining it leaves a (67:32 - 67:37)
little trail behind but (67:34 - 67:41)
ultimately whatever uh it it it's F you (67:37 - 67:44)
get you get five for free and I will at (67:41 - 67:46)
some point maybe use all five and be (67:44 - 67:48)
done and never touch it (67:46 - 67:51)
again uh you can get maridon for free as (67:48 - 67:53)
always you play the dumb board game to (67:51 - 67:56)
collect sandwiches it's sandwiches this (67:53 - 67:59)
time that makes sense uh and then once (67:56 - 68:02)
you get a thousand (67:59 - 68:05)
sandwiches you get [ __ ] for free or you (68:02 - 68:07)
just skip it and buy them or you just (68:05 - 68:09)
skip it and buy them which is what they (68:07 - 68:11)
want you to do because right now you can (68:09 - 68:12)
basically blast your way through every (68:11 - 68:13)
rank with this (68:12 - 68:16)
thing um speaking of a game I'll never (68:13 - 68:18)
touch again Cafe remix uh they added (68:16 - 68:20)
gimme ghoul and golden go to that game (68:18 - 68:23)
sure that that doesn't bring you back (68:20 - 68:25)
your boy your string cheese being served (68:23 - 68:29)
at the cafe I do like my boy um but I (68:25 - 68:32)
just don't like that form of puzzle (68:29 - 68:35)
game I would rather build a building and (68:32 - 68:37)
I already hate doing that here let's (68:35 - 68:40)
talk about the absolutely most exciting (68:37 - 68:42)
announcement of the whole (68:40 - 68:46)
presents Pokemon sleep now we're talking (68:42 - 68:49)
that was the good stuff uh also they (68:46 - 68:51)
announced a bunch of stuff for Pokemon (68:49 - 68:54)
sleep after the presents which could (68:51 - 68:56)
have been included in the presents it (68:54 - 68:58)
was this present was so weird because it (68:56 - 69:01)
was 13 minutes and most presents are (68:58 - 69:05)
like 18 20 24 minutes I'm just naming (69:01 - 69:06)
like the last three presents before this (69:05 - 69:08)
they were like closer to 20 minutes this (69:06 - 69:12)
one was 13 it felt so rushed even though (69:08 - 69:13)
like (69:12 - 69:16)
rush just give unite 30 more seconds (69:13 - 69:18)
give Masters 30 more seconds give (69:16 - 69:20)
Pokemon sleep 30 more seconds (69:18 - 69:23)
like you're you're not it's your it's (69:20 - 69:25)
your YouTube video you're not paying by (69:23 - 69:28)
the yeah they're not paying for it it's (69:25 - 69:32)
not broadcast on like as second yeah it (69:28 - 69:35)
was really bizarre how fast they move (69:32 - 69:37)
through that I was just like what is (69:35 - 69:40)
happening so they they announced that (69:37 - 69:43)
legendary Pokemon are finally coming to (69:40 - 69:44)
Pokemon (69:43 - 69:49)
sleep uh which is raicho ente and (69:44 - 69:52)
suun um Gen 2 remix confirmed let's go (69:49 - 69:56)
jetto yeah let's go jotto confirmed uh (69:52 - 69:58)
but because the presents went so quickly (69:56 - 70:01)
it was very kind of confusing of (69:58 - 70:05)
like how to get those (70:01 - 70:10)
Pokemon I think you have to like collect (70:05 - 70:10)
electric uh or some you have to like (70:11 - 70:16)
collect something to like get them to (70:14 - 70:18)
appear well for first they're starting (70:16 - 70:20)
off with raicho so here I have the I (70:18 - 70:23)
have the Reiko thing it says beginning (70:20 - 70:25)
at the end of March we're holding a (70:23 - 70:27)
raicho research you can exchange samples (70:25 - 70:30)
of raicho main that you collect during (70:27 - 70:32)
the event for a raicho incense and then (70:30 - 70:34)
you will be able to research reo's (70:32 - 70:38)
various sleep types electric type helper (70:34 - 70:40)
Pokemon will be particularly helpful so (70:38 - 70:41)
we recommend you raising your electric (70:40 - 70:43)
type helper Pokemon to get ready (70:41 - 70:45)
electric type helper Pokemon are Pikachu (70:43 - 70:48)
Raichu Jolan Pichu Marie flaffy and (70:45 - 70:51)
afros literally like six hours later (70:48 - 70:53)
they're like we're announcing Den which (70:51 - 70:57)
would also be in this list yeah um (70:53 - 70:59)
so it makes (70:57 - 71:02)
it like do we need the masterball for (70:59 - 71:04)
that (71:02 - 71:08)
then like (71:04 - 71:08)
probably I I guess is it worth Master (71:08 - 71:14)
Ball like it's it's it's very weird they (71:11 - 71:15)
also announced that you'll get 10 Pokey (71:14 - 71:17)
biscuits and a th000 diamonds which is a (71:15 - 71:20)
lot of diamonds for free just by logging (71:17 - 71:23)
in so do that they also announced that (71:20 - 71:25)
there's a new trial bundle which will (71:23 - 71:29)
get you 500 diamonds 10 Pokey biscuits a (71:25 - 71:32)
good camp ticket oh that's it um that'll (71:29 - 71:36)
be $299 a good camp ticket by itself is (71:32 - 71:37)
ultimately (71:36 - 71:40)
$5 um plus you're getting diamonds plus (71:37 - 71:42)
you're getting poke biscuits so if (71:40 - 71:44)
you're the type of person that like (71:42 - 71:47)
normally doesn't give mobile games money (71:44 - 71:49)
unless it's a really good deal that's a (71:47 - 71:51)
really good (71:49 - 71:53)
deal if you don't plan to give it money (71:51 - 71:54)
then (71:53 - 71:56)
if this isn't going to entice (71:54 - 71:59)
you I nothing else will this is a good (71:56 - 72:01)
deal so if if this is not good enough (71:59 - 72:03)
for you then continue not giving it (72:01 - 72:05)
money I support your I support your (72:03 - 72:07)
decision but a much better deal than (72:05 - 72:10)
most of their other bundles that costs (72:07 - 72:11)
20 to (72:10 - 72:15)
$50 uh and then they announc electric (72:11 - 72:18)
type week so much of this was just not (72:15 - 72:20)
in the presents electric type week will (72:18 - 72:23)
be March 11th through March 18th more (72:20 - 72:26)
electric type Pokemon will spawn you (72:23 - 72:28)
will also be able to use the mini candy (72:26 - 72:29)
boost function which doubles the effects (72:28 - 72:31)
of candies but also doubles the effects (72:29 - 72:35)
of or it costs more dream shards to use (72:31 - 72:39)
um more Pokemon will be hungry this (72:35 - 72:43)
week um effects applied separately of (72:39 - 72:45)
incense and good camp (72:43 - 72:48)
ticket um also you can get rewards like (72:45 - 72:51)
den den will make its debut on top of (72:48 - 72:55)
den debuting Den will have a new ability (72:51 - 72:58)
in the game which is called tasty chance (72:55 - 73:01)
small which will increase your chance of (72:58 - 73:04)
getting critical hit when you're cooking (73:01 - 73:05)
if you don't know what that is when you (73:04 - 73:07)
get the little exclamation point above (73:05 - 73:09)
your pot that means you've done a (73:07 - 73:11)
critical hit during Monday through (73:09 - 73:13)
Saturday it's a 10% chance every time (73:11 - 73:15)
you cook on Sunday it's a 30% chance (73:13 - 73:18)
when you cook for those thinking that (73:15 - 73:21)
Pokemon sleep is a very basic and (73:18 - 73:24)
nothingness game you're wrong there's so (73:21 - 73:28)
much to do it's so Advanced I'm so into (73:24 - 73:31)
it and I'm very excited for (73:28 - 73:34)
Den the den actually sounds pretty (73:31 - 73:37)
exciting I get that little bonus maybe (73:34 - 73:41)
once every three weeks so being able to (73:37 - 73:44)
up the chances there sounds pretty (73:41 - 73:48)
great if I keep playing and it sounds (73:44 - 73:51)
like it sounds likeing that in there the (73:48 - 73:53)
the Denis skill will apply until you (73:51 - 73:56)
eventually get it so when a little skill (73:53 - 74:00)
activates um and you don't critical hit (73:56 - 74:02)
that next time it's still technically (74:00 - 74:04)
active it will stay active until you do (74:02 - 74:06)
crit so it's (74:04 - 74:08)
not you're not using the skill for the (74:06 - 74:11)
next cooking well you are but it but you (74:08 - 74:14)
don't have to apply it again every time (74:11 - 74:17)
you cook it will stay active until the (74:14 - 74:20)
crit actually hits so I don't know how (74:17 - 74:24)
that Stacks but it sounds like (74:20 - 74:26)
Den it says on the website that it can (74:24 - 74:29)
stack up to a maximum of (74:26 - 74:31)
70% oh so every time you use it it's (74:29 - 74:33)
going to keep going up and up which is (74:31 - 74:35)
cool I don't know what that means when (74:33 - 74:38)
you have like a seven or six F five Den (74:35 - 74:42)
on your field um but that probably would (74:38 - 74:45)
be inefficient but I would assume that (74:42 - 74:48)
like have a team and two ingredient (74:45 - 74:51)
finders yeah D Den sounds very good (74:48 - 74:54)
regardless of of what what you're doing (74:51 - 74:56)
Den will when when when Den does appear (74:54 - 74:59)
which is March 11th it will only be on (74:56 - 75:02)
Green Grass and it will only be on (74:59 - 75:05)
lapis um and I think on green grass it's (75:02 - 75:06)
not going to start appearing until you (75:05 - 75:08)
get to ultra on lapis it won't start (75:06 - 75:11)
appearing until you get to um (75:08 - 75:13)
great so just keep that in (75:11 - 75:15)
mind (75:13 - 75:18)
um probably a better chance of denan (75:15 - 75:23)
lapis because green grass has a lot of (75:18 - 75:25)
other yeah there's a lot on green grass (75:23 - 75:27)
so I don't know pick your battles I mean (75:25 - 75:28)
I'm on lapis now I'm staying there until (75:27 - 75:30)
I get high (75:28 - 75:33)
ranks is also showing up during the (75:30 - 75:36)
electric type weeks so probably higher (75:33 - 75:38)
chances yeah we would (75:36 - 75:42)
hope we can only hope but yeah I think a (75:38 - 75:45)
lot of lot of Pokemon sleep it was again (75:42 - 75:46)
a bit of a bummer they didn't show any (75:45 - 75:48)
of that during (75:46 - 75:51)
the they had a neat little Raichu (75:48 - 75:53)
animation yeah yeah yeah yeah but I feel (75:51 - 75:55)
feel like announcing electric week is (75:53 - 75:58)
coming and like Den electric week coming (75:55 - 76:01)
raicho that's like 90 seconds yeah it (75:58 - 76:04)
just felt so weirdly abbreviated and (76:01 - 76:07)
also at like lightning fast (76:04 - 76:10)
speed abbreviated as a yeah (76:07 - 76:13)
that's the whole the whole pres just (76:10 - 76:17)
felt very abbreviated um okay let's talk (76:13 - 76:21)
about the very last thing (76:17 - 76:23)
they we could mention they they they (76:21 - 76:26)
brought up the anime it's coming soon (76:23 - 76:27)
it's the the carrot on the stick has (76:26 - 76:29)
been very long for the US folks on this (76:27 - 76:35)
anime thing um so sleep Masters unite (76:29 - 76:36)
Cafe (76:35 - 76:40)
remix new game anime anime based event (76:36 - 76:42)
and go yeah anime based event and go (76:40 - 76:44)
good call where they're bringing Captain (76:42 - 76:46)
Pikachu to go that was a surprise to no (76:44 - 76:48)
one since we saw that Captain Pikachu (76:46 - 76:52)
got added two two three weeks (76:48 - 76:56)
ago and then uh Char Cadet armar Rouge (76:52 - 76:59)
suu Edge coming to go um and then they (76:56 - 77:02)
did like a 24hour 48 (76:59 - 77:05)
hour hat Pokemon in go which was like (77:02 - 77:08)
fun and nice party hats for Pokemon day (77:05 - 77:11)
party hats for Pokemon day and then uh (77:08 - 77:14)
they announced a brand new game mobile (77:11 - 77:16)
well game is well it's a game it is a (77:14 - 77:20)
game it's a new game a game it is a game (77:16 - 77:22)
uh it's called (77:20 - 77:25)
pocket (77:22 - 77:25)
um (77:27 - 77:31)
and it is the the I think the most (77:29 - 77:33)
shocking thing about this is it's being (77:31 - 77:37)
made by DNA which yeah shocking that (77:33 - 77:39)
shocking that DNA is making another game (77:37 - 77:42)
shocking in (77:39 - 77:45)
like good because I think whether or not (77:42 - 77:48)
you like Masters it's really wellmade oh (77:45 - 77:51)
yeah it's it's very well made um and so (77:48 - 77:54)
that is like it it's it's like the (77:51 - 77:57)
opposite feeling of ilka like you see (77:54 - 78:00)
ilka on something and you're like oh but (77:57 - 78:02)
you see DNA and you're like oh they're (78:00 - 78:07)
pretty good yeah I'm in I'm (78:02 - 78:07)
in also kind of makes sense you know (78:07 - 78:12)
we're not going to sugarcoat it Pokemon (78:10 - 78:15)
Masters is a gotcha game this uh pocket (78:12 - 78:18)
seems very very (78:15 - 78:21)
got so it's in collaboration with (78:18 - 78:25)
creatures uh creatures does make the TCG (78:21 - 78:26)
I went to creatures while I was in Japan (78:25 - 78:29)
the Pokemon company invited me I think (78:26 - 78:31)
we've talked about it a little bit on on (78:29 - 78:32)
the podcast obviously I've talked about (78:31 - 78:35)
on the stream I wasn't allowed to like (78:32 - 78:37)
record like any video footage but we (78:35 - 78:38)
asked them like a bunch of questions and (78:37 - 78:40)
stuff the guy you see in the presents (78:38 - 78:43)
was the guy that I interviewed he's the (78:40 - 78:45)
CEO of creatures the guy in like all (78:43 - 78:47)
black fun fact he was also wearing all (78:45 - 78:49)
black when I interviewed him it seems (78:47 - 78:50)
like the guy likes all black his (78:49 - 78:52)
favorite Pokemon is Gengar that was (78:50 - 78:57)
asked um his favorite TCG set was tag (78:52 - 78:58)
team which I think was a super good (78:57 - 79:00)
answer I think tag team was absolutely (78:58 - 79:04)
brilliant when it came to the TCG (79:00 - 79:08)
um uh and another bit of trivia he says (79:04 - 79:10)
that he doesn't take any Pokemon cards (79:08 - 79:11)
home and there are no Pokemon cards (79:10 - 79:15)
allowed in his house so it's a real fun (79:11 - 79:18)
fact about him not one of those people (79:15 - 79:19)
with a Pokemon card displayed on the (79:18 - 79:21)
back of their phone then I guess no I (79:19 - 79:23)
don't think so I think he is I think (79:21 - 79:26)
he's very business I I get I got the (79:23 - 79:30)
energy of like my personal life and my (79:26 - 79:33)
work life are incredibly separate and I (79:30 - 79:36)
like it that way and I understand I can (79:33 - 79:37)
respect (79:36 - 79:40)
that so this is a collaboration with (79:37 - 79:43)
creatures and DNA to make this you're (79:40 - 79:46)
it's it's ultimately a t it's ultimately (79:43 - 79:50)
a collecting app uh which you collect (79:46 - 79:53)
digital cards you get two free pack taxs (79:50 - 79:56)
a day there is trading where you can (79:53 - 79:57)
trade (79:56 - 80:00)
cards and there is a (79:57 - 80:03)
small battle (80:00 - 80:06)
mode so you can like battle other people (80:03 - 80:08)
or actually I don't know if you can (80:06 - 80:10)
battle other people you can do little (80:08 - 80:13)
battle card battles against as far as we (80:10 - 80:14)
know a CPU I'm not actually sure if you (80:13 - 80:17)
can battle other people but you could (80:14 - 80:19)
trade other people that's like the whole (80:17 - 80:21)
the the whole gimmick there and then (80:19 - 80:22)
there's like immers they're called (80:21 - 80:23)
immers (80:22 - 80:26)
cards uh which are cards where you can (80:23 - 80:28)
like dive into the illustration which is (80:26 - 80:30)
really cool (80:28 - 80:33)
um (80:30 - 80:33)
and in (80:34 - 80:39)
retrospect it is shocking it has taken (80:36 - 80:42)
this long for an app like this to (80:39 - 80:44)
exist (80:42 - 80:46)
um they did also come out and say that (80:44 - 80:49)
this is not an nft app I don't know why (80:46 - 80:52)
that joke went (80:49 - 80:52)
around there are there have been plenty (80:52 - 80:58)
of digital collecting cards apps for a (80:55 - 81:01)
decade on IOS and Android well before (80:58 - 81:06)
nfts were even in anyone's mouth yeah is (81:01 - 81:09)
this the Pokemon Marvel Snap I've never (81:06 - 81:11)
played snap yeah I mean a lot of people (81:09 - 81:13)
I know who are excited who play who want (81:11 - 81:16)
it to be similar to Marvel snap like the (81:13 - 81:18)
collecting part I played snap for a (81:16 - 81:20)
little while like the collecting part (81:18 - 81:22)
sounds the same um you get multiple (81:20 - 81:24)
versions of cards and they all have (81:22 - 81:26)
different artart you can swap them in (81:24 - 81:29)
and out uh and I mean in Marvel snap you (81:26 - 81:32)
do fight against other people like (81:29 - 81:36)
that's the thing um and like there's a (81:32 - 81:38)
little the snap thing is like if you (81:36 - 81:40)
think you're gonna win you can snap so (81:38 - 81:42)
that the (81:40 - 81:45)
the pot for winning the points for (81:42 - 81:47)
winning are higher so like if you really (81:45 - 81:48)
think you're going to win you'll snap (81:47 - 81:50)
because it also will force the person to (81:48 - 81:51)
quit because they're like well I don't (81:50 - 81:53)
want to lose that much (81:51 - 81:55)
so kind of also guar there's like (81:53 - 81:57)
there's a lot of psychology in in the (81:55 - 82:00)
Marvel snap Universe about how to get (81:57 - 82:02)
your people to quit or when you snap or (82:00 - 82:05)
when you leave um but yeah I know a few (82:02 - 82:08)
people who are like I hope it's as good (82:05 - 82:11)
as Marvel snap because it sounds a lot (82:08 - 82:15)
like Marvel snap um you know and that (82:11 - 82:17)
would I I would probably try it for a (82:15 - 82:19)
little (82:17 - 82:22)
bit if it's that fast of a gameplay like (82:19 - 82:25)
Marvel plays fast honestly I am kind of (82:22 - 82:27)
looking forward to slightly simplified (82:25 - 82:30)
TCG battles because playing a full round (82:27 - 82:34)
of TCG can take some time and this seems (82:30 - 82:35)
like it's going to be a whole lot (82:34 - 82:38)
quicker and faster and (82:35 - 82:41)
more easy to get into than (82:38 - 82:45)
that yeah I want the immersive cards (82:41 - 82:47)
like I want yeah they're real (82:45 - 82:50)
pretty I I was told (82:47 - 82:53)
by dozens of people that I would love (82:50 - 82:57)
Marvel snap and I believe those people I (82:53 - 82:59)
believe whatever Marvel snap is I would (82:57 - 83:03)
like it the the the barrier to entry on (82:59 - 83:06)
that is I do not care about Marvel at (83:03 - 83:11)
all and I'm sure if I did a little bit I (83:06 - 83:13)
would like Marvel snap it seems very (83:11 - 83:15)
cool from everything people have (83:13 - 83:18)
described to me um another comparison (83:15 - 83:21)
here uh well I guess I guess comparing (83:18 - 83:27)
time pocket is not TCG which TCG Pokemon (83:21 - 83:29)
Trading Card Game Live replaced Pokemon (83:27 - 83:32)
Trading Card Game online ptcgo and so (83:29 - 83:35)
the question I saw frequently is why do (83:32 - 83:37)
both of these exist um and I think the (83:35 - 83:41)
comparison here is probably uh Yu-Gi-Oh (83:37 - 83:42)
Yu-Gi-Oh has something called Master (83:41 - 83:43)
duel and then Yu-Gi-Oh has something (83:42 - 83:46)
called dual links dual links appeals (83:43 - 83:49)
mainly to Casual players and anime fans (83:46 - 83:51)
while master duel is geared more towards (83:49 - 83:53)
competitive gameplay and is ideal for (83:51 - 83:57)
TCG and ocg players uh and that's how (83:53 - 83:59)
Yu-Gi-Oh describes the difference (83:57 - 84:02)
between the two uh I think a really (83:59 - 84:03)
really important thing that people are (84:02 - 84:05)
missing when they ask that question is (84:03 - 84:09)
like why don't they just roll this into (84:05 - 84:12)
TCG or why does TCG exist then if this (84:09 - 84:15)
is coming out TCG is an American product (84:12 - 84:19)
it is not available in Japan ptcgo was (84:15 - 84:22)
never available in available in Japan um (84:19 - 84:25)
neither of those (84:22 - 84:25)
apps like I I I don't know how hard or (84:25 - 84:31)
easy it is for a player in like Germany (84:28 - 84:34)
Australia China South Korea Japan to get (84:31 - 84:37)
ptcg I'm I'm sure in most of those (84:34 - 84:40)
regions it's fine you make an account I (84:37 - 84:41)
mean look we can s make our switches go (84:40 - 84:46)
to Australia to get a game early um but (84:41 - 84:48)
when you buy a booster pack in Japan it (84:46 - 84:50)
comes with five cards it doesn't come (84:48 - 84:52)
with a code card and you buy a booster (84:50 - 84:54)
pack in America it's 10 cards it comes (84:52 - 84:57)
with a code card to pcgl um so they're (84:54 - 84:59)
they're different and also most people (84:57 - 85:03)
playing ptcg are not boot first off that (84:59 - 85:06)
app is not good we'll (85:03 - 85:10)
just it's it's just not a very good app (85:06 - 85:14)
uh sorry bring back direwolf digital (85:10 - 85:18)
they made a decent app to (85:14 - 85:21)
their to the limitations they had put on (85:18 - 85:23)
by the Pokemon company internet National (85:21 - 85:27)
um sorry Dire Wolf digital we miss you (85:23 - 85:29)
uh but they're still making games and go (85:27 - 85:33)
play root the people are logging into (85:29 - 85:36)
TCG to practice for tournaments and to (85:33 - 85:38)
climb the ladder and that's really it (85:36 - 85:39)
that's what they're doing and that's (85:38 - 85:41)
fine and that's what that's that's the (85:39 - 85:44)
service that is offering you there's no (85:41 - 85:48)
trading at all in TCG if you open your (85:44 - 85:50)
fifth Zig zigon it turns into dust (85:48 - 85:52)
you're only allowed to have four Zig (85:50 - 85:54)
zigon cuz you only need four cards in a (85:52 - 85:56)
deck any extra cards you have just turn (85:54 - 85:58)
gets crushed into dust you can use that (85:56 - 86:00)
dust to buy Cards you're missing I am (85:58 - 86:02)
sure there are some people listening to (86:00 - 86:04)
this podcast that are like I want to (86:02 - 86:07)
collect all the cards in TCG you can do (86:04 - 86:10)
that there's not a huge incentive to (86:07 - 86:12)
doing that especially since there's not (86:10 - 86:15)
trading whereas in like ptcgo you could (86:12 - 86:17)
realistically complete a collection and (86:15 - 86:20)
there was like bonuses for completing a (86:17 - 86:22)
collection but that was also easy to do (86:20 - 86:24)
because one there was no like dust to (86:22 - 86:26)
crush into you just kept opening packs (86:24 - 86:28)
and opening packs and then you would (86:26 - 86:32)
have like I have seven Charizard EXs (86:28 - 86:34)
cool I can trade three of them to (86:32 - 86:35)
somebody else on the auction board or (86:34 - 86:38)
just literally do a trade um and TCG (86:35 - 86:40)
doesn't have that and I think that's (86:38 - 86:42)
fine for tcel not to have that but I (86:40 - 86:45)
think separating out these apps they can (86:42 - 86:47)
both exist in the same world and not (86:45 - 86:49)
compete with each other because Master (86:47 - 86:51)
duel and duel links do not compete with (86:49 - 86:53)
each other they're they're different as (86:51 - 86:55)
I described and I think there are (86:53 - 86:58)
players including myself that want to (86:55 - 87:00)
collect Pokemon cards but don't want an (86:58 - 87:03)
entire shelf behind me with a bunch of (87:00 - 87:05)
cards and boxes that I don't know what (87:03 - 87:06)
to do (87:05 - 87:09)
with because one they're expensive two (87:06 - 87:13)
they're heavy three I sorting them is a (87:09 - 87:16)
a a month Affair I would have to quit (87:13 - 87:17)
everything in my life if you have a (87:16 - 87:18)
nine-o-five job I don't know how you're (87:17 - 87:20)
sorting Pokemon cards it's a nightmare (87:18 - 87:23)
it's so so having like a (87:20 - 87:25)
having like a digital app where you can (87:23 - 87:27)
have that feeling of collecting cards (87:25 - 87:29)
where you can like trade where you get (87:27 - 87:30)
free booster packs who knows how (87:29 - 87:32)
microtransaction this is and then to do (87:30 - 87:35)
like quick matches I think is so (87:32 - 87:39)
incredibly smart and so (87:35 - 87:39)
exciting the problem is now I want code (87:41 - 87:47)
cards for for pocket anytime I get (87:43 - 87:49)
actual IRL cards yeah I'm going I'm (87:47 - 87:51)
going to assume those code cards don't (87:49 - 87:54)
work no almost definitely won't but (87:51 - 87:56)
that's what I'd want because I have no (87:54 - 87:59)
interest in the other one pocket looks (87:56 - 88:02)
interesting I I think I think that is I (87:59 - 88:04)
think that's the big thing to think (88:02 - 88:07)
about too is like the only reason you're (88:04 - 88:09)
probably downloading TCG is because (88:07 - 88:12)
you're you want to practice and you want (88:09 - 88:15)
to play more matches which is like it's (88:12 - 88:17)
awesome that that product exists for (88:15 - 88:18)
that to like practice before a (88:17 - 88:21)
tournament to test out a deck to cuz (88:18 - 88:23)
like some cards are expensive right like (88:21 - 88:25)
if you have you know tapu Lele used to (88:23 - 88:27)
be an $80 (88:25 - 88:29)
card and if your deck needed three of (88:27 - 88:31)
them but you weren't sure and you didn't (88:29 - 88:34)
have that you could like test on TCG TCG (88:31 - 88:36)
or TCG and be like okay I I do feel (88:34 - 88:37)
comfortable with three or maybe I (88:36 - 88:41)
actually need two so $160 versus $240 (88:37 - 88:43)
pretty big difference to be like okay (88:41 - 88:45)
I'll only buy two feels feels good with (88:43 - 88:51)
two not three um but man pocket looks so (88:45 - 88:54)
cool it it it's just like I think it's (88:51 - 88:57)
so exciting to me cuz it feels like it's (88:54 - 89:00)
exactly what I want something (88:57 - 89:03)
light something that like like I just (89:00 - 89:05)
think about the concept of Pokemon home (89:03 - 89:08)
or even the concept of Pokemon go and (89:05 - 89:10)
absolutely my favorite thing in Pokemon (89:08 - 89:14)
go is like to trade people like I well I (89:10 - 89:15)
don't know if I scammed a lot of people (89:14 - 89:17)
in LA but a lot of people were very (89:15 - 89:19)
excited to get sigil for me I was (89:17 - 89:21)
swimming in sigil and I could pretty (89:19 - 89:23)
much I could pretty much get anything I (89:21 - 89:26)
want for a Sigil and just like how (89:23 - 89:28)
excited those people were to be like oh (89:26 - 89:30)
my gosh I finally got sigil thank you so (89:28 - 89:34)
much to like like travel to Hawaii for (89:30 - 89:36)
worlds or something and be like oh man (89:34 - 89:38)
I'm just (89:36 - 89:42)
missing Charizard EX and I'm like I have (89:38 - 89:44)
all of these like secret rares or (89:42 - 89:46)
rainbow rares or whatever and like to (89:44 - 89:50)
just trade somebody that is so cool I (89:46 - 89:52)
think to like to me because I feel like (89:50 - 89:55)
trading doesn't exist in the actual (89:52 - 89:58)
current physical TCG and I think the (89:55 - 90:00)
reason it it doesn't exist is because (89:58 - 90:03)
there's so much money behind it like I (90:00 - 90:04)
it's hard for me to walk into a card (90:03 - 90:07)
shop and be like oh man I'm missing I'm (90:04 - 90:11)
missing the Umbreon from evolving Skies (90:07 - 90:12)
like that's the one C spoiler that (90:11 - 90:16)
Umbreon from evolving Skies is (90:12 - 90:18)
$600 that's that's the going price for (90:16 - 90:21)
that Umbreon so to be like I have the in (90:18 - 90:23)
complete collection of evolving Skies (90:21 - 90:25)
but I'm missing the Umbreon and you walk (90:23 - 90:29)
into a card shop and be like what can I (90:25 - 90:31)
like I have to trade you what like 30 (90:29 - 90:33)
cards just for this Umbreon to sit in a (90:31 - 90:36)
binder it sucks like I get that like (90:33 - 90:38)
people enjoy the money aspect of that (90:36 - 90:40)
and that's cool and that's fine but if (90:38 - 90:42)
you're just like trying to complete (90:40 - 90:44)
evolving (90:42 - 90:47)
Skies that's like a like the complete (90:44 - 90:48)
evolving Skies is like two months worth (90:47 - 90:50)
of rent to get all those cards it's just (90:48 - 90:55)
so expensive to do that so to be like in (90:50 - 90:57)
Pocket it kind of (90:55 - 91:00)
dissolves that pricing structure I sure (90:57 - 91:02)
hope it does I don't want any of that to (91:00 - 91:05)
carry over although I will note it does (91:02 - 91:08)
say as expected that it's a free to (91:05 - 91:10)
start game so there is going to be money (91:08 - 91:13)
involved so let's just (91:10 - 91:16)
hope the pricing structures don't carry (91:13 - 91:18)
over from IRL (91:16 - 91:21)
TCG oh I'm sure there'll be somebody on (91:18 - 91:24)
NBA being like I got got an um um umbre (91:21 - 91:26)
from evolving Skies if you PayPal me $20 (91:24 - 91:28)
and trade me a Pidgey I will send you (91:26 - 91:32)
over this card undoubtedly but hopefully (91:28 - 91:35)
not too much (91:32 - 91:37)
yeah but anyways it seems like a fun (91:35 - 91:38)
collecting thing I like to (91:37 - 91:41)
collect (91:38 - 91:45)
so um don't know when that they did say (91:41 - 91:47)
that's coming out this year have no clue (91:45 - 91:49)
when they didn't say summer they didn't (91:47 - 91:52)
say fall so who knows hey remember (91:49 - 91:53)
remember when TCG live got announced and (91:52 - 91:55)
they were like October and then suddenly (91:53 - 91:58)
it was like never (91:55 - 92:01)
mind next (91:58 - 92:04)
year (92:01 - 92:07)
so oh did they say anything else (92:04 - 92:10)
specifically about pocket I don't think (92:07 - 92:12)
they did good trailer though that (92:10 - 92:14)
trailer the the trailer for pocket was (92:12 - 92:17)
longer than everything before it came (92:14 - 92:19)
that's cuz it's a new game they gave (92:17 - 92:23)
time to the new game to both of the new (92:19 - 92:25)
games they said uh players will have the (92:23 - 92:26)
thrill of opening booster packs (92:25 - 92:28)
collecting cards visual effects (92:26 - 92:31)
immersive cards players will get two (92:28 - 92:32)
booster packs a day no (92:31 - 92:36)
cost um in addition players can engage (92:32 - 92:38)
in quick battles with streamlined rules (92:36 - 92:41)
on the classic system in development (92:38 - 92:42)
with (92:41 - 92:45)
DNA and will launch free on IOS and (92:42 - 92:47)
Android so yeah we kind of covered (92:45 - 92:48)
everything good trailer though good (92:47 - 92:50)
trailer it looks like you can trade it (92:48 - 92:51)
it doesn't look like it's Pokémon go (92:50 - 92:53)
where you have to be local to trade (92:51 - 92:58)
somebody was trading on a bus uh so if (92:53 - 93:01)
the trailer is accurate you you two (92:58 - 93:04)
listener can also trade on a bus maybe (93:01 - 93:05)
you're listening to a bus maybe you're (93:04 - 93:09)
on a bus right now listening to this (93:05 - 93:09)
podcast uh (93:10 - 93:17)
overall I think this was a good (93:13 - 93:17)
present it was was too fast that's the (93:20 - 93:26)
only (93:23 - 93:28)
thing you have to watch it three times (93:26 - 93:30)
to real get it to really get everything (93:28 - 93:32)
everything that they announced was great (93:30 - 93:35)
like I think there's the reasons to be (93:32 - 93:37)
excited which is the whole point of a (93:35 - 93:39)
presents right like let's get you (93:37 - 93:43)
excited the thing that (93:39 - 93:43)
I the thing that bothered me about how (93:43 - 93:50)
fast it was is it felt (93:46 - 93:50)
like they were just like let's just get (93:50 - 93:54)
in and out fast before anybody yells at (93:52 - 93:57)
us like it felt like a weird defensive (93:54 - 94:00)
move instead of like let's celebrate (93:57 - 94:02)
Pokemon because it just went so they (94:00 - 94:04)
didn't even Linger on codes they didn't (94:02 - 94:06)
Linger on things they just clip clip (94:04 - 94:08)
clip clip clip let's get in let's let's (94:06 - 94:10)
get out like we just we don't want to (94:08 - 94:13)
take any more heat um which is sort of (94:10 - 94:15)
like when I was watching it live I just (94:13 - 94:19)
kept thinking why are you going you have (94:15 - 94:21)
all the time in the world and a captive (94:19 - 94:24)
audience why are you going so (94:21 - 94:28)
fast it's it's it's crazy cuz like the (94:24 - 94:30)
the the points were so quick and then in (94:28 - 94:32)
the past because I literally watched (94:30 - 94:34)
every Pokemon Day video to make this (94:32 - 94:36)
huge YouTube video that I put out which (94:34 - 94:38)
thank you to anyone who watched it is (94:36 - 94:41)
like they would spend three times as (94:38 - 94:44)
long on like an original Stitch shirt (94:41 - 94:46)
launch it would be like here are some (94:44 - 94:50)
new shirts a bunch of new designs you (94:46 - 94:54)
can get them tailored now kids can do it (94:50 - 94:56)
here's like a video of a business guy (94:54 - 94:57)
getting on a bus and he has like a (94:56 - 94:59)
little Charizard and then somebody (94:57 - 95:01)
acknowledged it and then they like (94:59 - 95:03)
looked each other in the eyes it was (95:01 - 95:04)
like they told a whole story about (95:03 - 95:07)
shirts and we can't even get 30 extra (95:04 - 95:11)
seconds of Pokemon sleep which had a new (95:07 - 95:13)
event that they just announced on (95:11 - 95:15)
Twitter (95:13 - 95:19)
instead like it felt so aggressive of (95:15 - 95:20)
like we got to get through all this (95:19 - 95:21)
stuff otherwise people are going to be (95:20 - 95:23)
mad or like people are going to be bored (95:21 - 95:26)
and it's like don't worry about those (95:23 - 95:28)
people yeah plus I think everybody I (95:26 - 95:32)
mean I haven't seen anybody unhappy (95:28 - 95:36)
with anything I'm sure those people (95:32 - 95:40)
exist but this seems like a generally (95:36 - 95:43)
well I like the 800 people watching me I (95:40 - 95:47)
saw one guy go this (95:43 - 95:47)
sucked I it seemed like a well-received (95:48 - 95:55)
present I I think a lot of PE (95:51 - 95:59)
I they were real like they for all the (95:55 - 96:01)
games that are working well they added (95:59 - 96:04)
things to make it slightly better they (96:01 - 96:06)
announced a nebulous thing there's not a (96:04 - 96:09)
lot that was really offensive in that uh (96:06 - 96:11)
it was just sort of like we're adding (96:09 - 96:12)
all things we're going to go through it (96:11 - 96:14)
quickly (96:12 - 96:17)
like you know even like you know what (96:14 - 96:20)
was also weird is go had a brand new (96:17 - 96:23)
season and they don't yeah I thought (96:20 - 96:24)
that that was going to be detailed in (96:23 - 96:26)
the presents I was telling people the (96:24 - 96:27)
day before that I thought that maybe we (96:26 - 96:30)
were G to get all of the new season (96:27 - 96:32)
announcements in the presents and nope (96:30 - 96:35)
nope which was like like why just talk (96:32 - 96:39)
about your new season and go like what (96:35 - 96:41)
yeah I don't take the (96:39 - 96:44)
time got going on I just expected that (96:41 - 96:46)
trailer to be in the the presents the (96:44 - 96:48)
trailer itself the Go trailer was what (96:46 - 96:52)
like 28 seconds long and like it just (96:48 - 96:53)
seemed like they could have just rolled (96:52 - 96:57)
that into the to the present to be fair (96:53 - 96:59)
Pokemon go isn't making very good (96:57 - 97:00)
trailers these (96:59 - 97:04)
days yeah their quality has gone down I (97:00 - 97:05)
I think the trailer they played was very (97:04 - 97:08)
like safe it was like the trailer they (97:05 - 97:10)
yes yes but if they had to make one for (97:08 - 97:11)
the (97:10 - 97:14)
season I'm not sure I actually already (97:11 - 97:16)
having we're already having the ultra be (97:14 - 97:18)
alra Beast conversation again of whether (97:16 - 97:20)
like soal or lunala or like Ultra beast (97:18 - 97:23)
and like they're (97:20 - 97:25)
not I've already seen that going around (97:23 - 97:29)
and then who knows like I don't I'm like (97:25 - 97:31)
arni they going to put selia and lunala (97:29 - 97:35)
in the ultra Wormhole things instead of (97:31 - 97:37)
the eggs because (97:35 - 97:40)
they like I they do come out of the (97:37 - 97:42)
ultra Wormhole no one is debating that (97:40 - 97:44)
but they are not Ultra (97:42 - 97:48)
[Laughter] (97:44 - 97:49)
Beast I don't want to have this (97:48 - 97:53)
conversation again (97:49 - 97:55)
um yeah uh the other thing they didn't (97:53 - 97:58)
mention at all was Hawaii but (97:55 - 98:02)
I I think that was intentional I I I I (97:58 - 98:04)
think (98:02 - 98:08)
like some people don't care about Hawaii (98:04 - 98:10)
or some people are like over Hawaii or (98:08 - 98:12)
some people just live under a rock and (98:10 - 98:14)
have no clue what's happening in Hawaii (98:12 - 98:16)
or happened in Hawaii I should say I (98:14 - 98:18)
don't think anything's on fire anymore (98:16 - 98:20)
um but like that doesn't mean like (98:18 - 98:21)
damage isn't done that doesn't mean (98:20 - 98:23)
there's not ill will towards like that (98:21 - 98:25)
like whether this was Pokemon or Final (98:23 - 98:27)
Fantasy or Diablo or Blizzard or (98:25 - 98:30)
whatever like there is (98:27 - 98:33)
always frustration of like tourism (98:30 - 98:36)
destroying Hawaii but then there's also (98:33 - 98:37)
the Hawaii government being like this (98:36 - 98:39)
pays our bills uh I just think it was (98:37 - 98:41)
like probably like the safe play to be (98:39 - 98:42)
like hey if we just don't talk about (98:41 - 98:45)
Hawaii we don't have to deal with any of (98:42 - 98:48)
this I think they also took a very long (98:45 - 98:49)
time to announce the dates for last (98:48 - 98:53)
year's worlds too (98:49 - 98:53)
yeah they didn't announce it they just (98:54 - 98:58)
said it was coming in Japan yeah at last (98:55 - 99:00)
year's presents they didn't have the (98:58 - 99:05)
dates so yeah although it's August we (99:00 - 99:08)
just don't know which weekend in August (99:05 - 99:11)
which is not super helpful I mean go (99:08 - 99:14)
does the same thing like just announce (99:11 - 99:15)
just announce all your events for the (99:14 - 99:16)
year (99:15 - 99:19)
like people have to take time off people (99:16 - 99:21)
have to like see if they can budget a (99:19 - 99:24)
flight like at least Pokemon go (99:21 - 99:25)
announces the community days is ahead of (99:24 - 99:27)
time at this point we know which (99:25 - 99:29)
weekends they're going to be most of the (99:27 - 99:33)
time well also we just recently saw the (99:29 - 99:39)
asset file for Pokemon go Fest so soon (99:33 - 99:42)
maybe who (99:39 - 99:44)
knows whoa there's going to be another (99:42 - 99:46)
Pokemon go Fest this year crazy who (99:44 - 99:48)
would have (99:46 - 99:48)
guessed no one saw that one coming (99:49 - 99:56)
uh yeah overall I pretty happy with this (99:52 - 99:58)
presents (99:56 - 100:01)
um I'm I'm I I wasn't worried about not (99:58 - 100:03)
having a game this year like I said I (100:01 - 100:04)
think scarlet and violet has more than (100:03 - 100:09)
enough to keep going um which is fine if (100:04 - 100:11)
ilka is working on something that could (100:09 - 100:15)
be announced later that could (100:11 - 100:17)
be if if they're working on anything (100:15 - 100:19)
maybe it's a better version of Pokemon (100:17 - 100:23)
home please like (100:19 - 100:23)
Pokemon home is what (100:24 - 100:31)
like five years old I think and hasn't (100:26 - 100:34)
had like a substantial update it's had (100:31 - 100:36)
small updates to like add new Pokemon or (100:34 - 100:39)
to like fix things or like (100:36 - 100:42)
but that feels (100:39 - 100:46)
archaic at this point I don't know um (100:42 - 100:48)
yeah good Pokemon (100:46 - 100:53)
day I wish I I wish they (100:48 - 100:53)
I I just wish they communicated more in (100:54 - 100:59)
the in the present instead of like (100:56 - 101:01)
relying well first off pokemon.com (100:59 - 101:03)
barely gets updated I mean it does but (101:01 - 101:04)
like even on pokemon.com you're like (101:03 - 101:07)
missing details and like Pokemon Twitter (101:04 - 101:09)
is like all over the place of like the (101:07 - 101:12)
sleep stuff was on the Sleep Twitter and (101:09 - 101:14)
the competitive stuff was or the the the (101:12 - 101:17)
raid stuff was on play Pokemon (101:14 - 101:20)
Twitter uh it's just like you would (101:17 - 101:22)
think that the presents would have (101:20 - 101:25)
everything for the day and that was a (101:22 - 101:27)
weird choice (101:25 - 101:30)
but um hey if you made it if you made it (101:27 - 101:31)

lot of people are going to say Za uh but (101:41 - 101:45)
