so (1:09 - 1:13)
I don't know why I don't know why either (1:10 - 1:16)
I know I do know why because I got (1:13 - 1:18)
invited to some secret thing that I (1:16 - 1:20)
can't talk about yet it's not that (1:18 - 1:23)
exciting I promise and then Nintendo was (1:20 - 1:24)

well go to both I guess I'll be at Pax (1:35 - 1:40)
you actually have a media pass on the (1:40 - 1:44)
floor or are you just gonna be like (1:43 - 1:47)
lurking around the outside (1:44 - 1:50)
um no I got a media pass uh I did get (1:47 - 1:52)
approved for that and then I got past I (1:50 - 1:54)
got a pass maybe they're giving me a (1:52 - 1:56)
guest pass for the Nintendo live thing I (1:54 - 1:58)
don't know so maybe I I don't even know (1:56 - 2:00)
what the Nintendo live thing is it's the (1:58 - 2:01)
first year that they're doing it (2:00 - 2:04)
and then I got a meeting on Thursday and (2:01 - 2:06)
then I have to run from that meeting to (2:04 - 2:09)
like host metoo raids hey uh first bit (2:06 - 2:11)
of news here oh yeah this is a Pokemon (2:09 - 2:13)
show I'm not gonna lie this is gonna be (2:11 - 2:16)
a very go heavy Pokemon show since uh uh (2:13 - 2:20)
Hannah got back from go Fest New York (2:16 - 2:21)
uh (2:20 - 2:24)
I mean I I talked already about my Osaka (2:21 - 2:27)
experience but go Fest Global was this (2:24 - 2:28)
past weekend (2:27 - 2:32)
and Greg and I dedicated 16 hours to (2:28 - 2:34)
that I think Hannah skipped the second (2:32 - 2:39)
not well the second day yeah we'll we'll (2:34 - 2:40)
get to that (2:39 - 2:42)
um but we'll we'll get through the (2:40 - 2:44)
little bit of news here real quick uh I (2:42 - 2:46)
didn't do up show notes but it's real (2:44 - 2:47)
basic news so first bit of news is (2:46 - 2:50)
Mewtwo is gonna debut in seven star (2:47 - 2:51)
raids (2:50 - 2:53)
this week we don't know what Mewtwo's (2:51 - 2:55)
moveset is (2:53 - 2:57)
um we never know that until five minutes (2:55 - 3:00)
after Mewtwo will appear uh it should (2:57 - 3:02)
for the US people be on Thursday night (3:00 - 3:06)
because these rides do go off UTC time (3:02 - 3:09)
uh that being said (3:06 - 3:13)
Anubis which is somebody who does a lot (3:09 - 3:16)
of data analysis on Pokemon games (3:13 - 3:19)
says that when you bring your Mew to a (3:16 - 3:22)
battle its HP should increase by 50 (3:19 - 3:24)
percent and then it's defense special (3:22 - 3:27)
defense speed attack special attack (3:24 - 3:30)
should increase by 20 if you do bring it (3:27 - 3:35)
against Mewtwo that ultimately makes (3:30 - 3:41)
mu the undeniable choice to bring to me (3:35 - 3:41)
so (3:41 - 3:44)
um (3:43 - 3:45)
I know there are raids for like half (3:44 - 3:48)
marine and Grim's gnarl uh surprise you (3:45 - 3:51)
can do everything those Pokemon can do (3:48 - 3:56)
and uh and more yeah and and they're (3:51 - 3:59)
doing like Blissey raids and like Mew is (3:56 - 4:01)
just a better Blissey in the in (3:59 - 4:03)
literally just because Mewtwo's side (4:01 - 4:05)
strike is so strong against Blissey (4:03 - 4:07)
because sides strike is based off of (4:05 - 4:08)
your (4:07 - 4:11)
defense and Blissey has a super high (4:08 - 4:13)
special defense but blissey's defense is (4:11 - 4:18)
this equivalent to a pidgey's defense (4:13 - 4:20)
um so side strike is really strong (4:18 - 4:22)
against Blissey assuming that me too has (4:20 - 4:25)
high strike which is technically it's (4:22 - 4:27)
signature move I don't know signature (4:25 - 4:29)
moves are weird the like (4:27 - 4:31)
give a Pokemon a signature move and then (4:29 - 4:33)
take it away the Next Generation it's so (4:31 - 4:36)
it's so weird but whatever (4:33 - 4:38)
um bring them you if you don't know what (4:36 - 4:41)
to put on a Mew uh acid spray is really (4:38 - 4:42)
good (4:41 - 4:46)
uh and struggle bug is really good the (4:42 - 4:48)
other two moves (4:46 - 4:50)
if you're a ghost Mew do Shadow Ball if (4:48 - 4:52)
you're a dark meat do Dark Pulse if (4:50 - 4:54)
you're a bug me use pollen Puff (4:52 - 4:58)
if you're none of that I'm considered (4:54 - 5:00)
changing your Terror type Maybe (4:58 - 5:04)
I'm a dark Mew with a dangerous past (5:00 - 5:08)
uh by the time I I should have a a (5:04 - 5:10)
general mu raid build (5:08 - 5:11)
um that should go up on Tuesday if (5:10 - 5:13)
you're listening to the podcast on (5:11 - 5:17)
on Monday but (5:13 - 5:19)
there's a lot of variety (5:17 - 5:20)
um (5:19 - 5:22)
and you'll probably actually want to (5:20 - 5:26)
invest in HP because of the 50 HP boost (5:22 - 5:29)
I did run the numbers and actually HP is (5:26 - 5:32)
better than special defense so (5:29 - 5:36)
um I'll I'll make a whole video for that (5:32 - 5:36)
uh second minute news here and the the (5:37 - 5:41)
best news of the show I love our weekly (5:39 - 5:45)
Pokemon sleep segment version (5:41 - 5:49)
1.0.6 is out good sleep day also on the (5:45 - 5:53)
horizon here that'll be August 30th to (5:49 - 5:57)
celebrate 10 million downloads that's a (5:53 - 5:59)
lot of downloads players will obtain a (5:57 - 6:01)
thousand sleep points a good camp ticket (5:59 - 6:04)
three ingredient ticket and five Pokey (6:01 - 6:06)
biscuits for free you just gotta update (6:04 - 6:08)
the app and then (6:06 - 6:10)
click the little gift button under the (6:08 - 6:12)
main menu and then you'll get your stuff (6:10 - 6:15)
I'm loving all the free stuff the team (6:12 - 6:17)
that makes this is fantastic (6:15 - 6:20)
yeah select button pretty pretty good at (6:17 - 6:22)
mobile games I would have guessed after (6:20 - 6:23)
Magikarp jump they're doing (6:22 - 6:25)
communication well they're doing free (6:23 - 6:27)
gifts well it just feels good to be (6:25 - 6:30)
actively playing this game you know what (6:27 - 6:32)
you do is you see what niantic's doing (6:30 - 6:35)
and then you do the opposite you hire (6:32 - 6:37)
people (6:35 - 6:39)
I don't actually know how many people (6:37 - 6:41)
work as the like button I have no clue (6:39 - 6:43)
how big their team is now I think I had (6:41 - 6:45)
like at one point like a thousand people (6:43 - 6:47)
working for them but they also had like (6:45 - 6:52)
five games going had past tense (6:47 - 6:54)
who does something (6:52 - 6:56)
I think that monster hunter games in (6:54 - 6:57)
beta (6:56 - 6:59)
um (6:57 - 7:00)
we don't have to spend a lot of time on (6:59 - 7:01)
sleep I do want to know though Hannah (7:00 - 7:06)
you are on the uh the premium (7:01 - 7:09)
now that you're on the premium for what (7:06 - 7:11)
almost two weeks now right yep it (7:09 - 7:12)
actually already ended and because they (7:11 - 7:15)
canceled it immediately I didn't roll (7:12 - 7:19)
over okay good job did the two weeks not (7:15 - 7:22)
convince you that it was (7:19 - 7:22)
getting enough sleep points every day (7:24 - 7:29)
because usually I'm getting between 50 (7:27 - 7:34)
and 75 otherwise getting 150 or 175 just (7:29 - 7:35)
felt better (7:34 - 7:38)
but other than that (7:35 - 7:40)
I just played the game the same way I (7:38 - 7:41)
mean (7:40 - 7:43)
I could go way more than the special (7:41 - 7:45)
biscuit every day didn't didn't help (7:43 - 7:48)
either it was fun (7:45 - 7:50)
it was fine it's a fun game I'm enjoying (7:48 - 7:52)
the game with or without the premium (7:50 - 7:55)
honestly (7:52 - 7:55)
yeah I I I still really liked that game (7:55 - 8:01)
a whole a whole bunch (7:59 - 8:05)
have either of you gotten Chinese no (8:01 - 8:07)
okay (8:05 - 8:09)
yep nope me neither (8:07 - 8:13)
people have though yeah yeah I uh (8:09 - 8:16)
you know I've always kinda (8:13 - 8:20)
like like shinies are still (8:16 - 8:24)
not this is like how do I frame this (8:20 - 8:26)
like Chinese shiny seem to like Drive (8:24 - 8:29)
Pokemon go a lot but like a very like (8:26 - 8:32)
hardcore already vocal base of Pokemon (8:29 - 8:34)
go (8:32 - 8:36)
um and I think that's like the same for (8:34 - 8:38)
main Series games where like the most (8:36 - 8:40)
vocal fans (8:38 - 8:43)
also probably dabble in Chinese but (8:40 - 8:45)
overall like shiny Pokemon or people who (8:43 - 8:47)
like to shiny Hunt is still in the (8:45 - 8:50)
minority of like fans (8:47 - 8:51)
like there are plenty of people who go (8:50 - 8:53)
through a game play it never see a shiny (8:51 - 8:55)
but they're like I beat that Pokemon (8:53 - 8:57)
game and then they just put it down and (8:55 - 8:59)
I don't know pick up like Eldon ring or (8:57 - 9:02)
fortnite or something right like (8:59 - 9:04)
yeah like it's an exciting surprise in (9:02 - 9:05)
the morning and sleep and guaranteed (9:04 - 9:08)
catch it is but I don't think the (9:05 - 9:09)
shinies alone is (9:08 - 9:11)
like I I'm always under the impression (9:09 - 9:13)
like just because a Pokemon game has (9:11 - 9:15)
shinies doesn't mean it (9:13 - 9:18)
like that alone is a selling point to (9:15 - 9:22)
drive people to it it is not a feature (9:18 - 9:25)
that sells copies it is just a nice (9:22 - 9:27)
thing in there but it's not bringing (9:25 - 9:29)
people through the door (9:27 - 9:32)
yeah like it might it might (9:29 - 9:34)
bring you through the door and then you (9:32 - 9:36)
go man I don't like this gameplay Loop (9:34 - 9:39)
and then you go right yeah yeah you (9:36 - 9:42)
bring it back out that door (9:39 - 9:42)
yeah I'd be curious if there's somebody (9:43 - 9:46)
that's like I'm only playing this game (9:45 - 9:48)
for shinies and they've been sleeping (9:46 - 9:50)
for like (9:48 - 9:50)
for seven days and I've not gotten a (9:51 - 9:57)
shiny (9:55 - 9:57)
yeah I I like it a lot (9:57 - 10:03)
Sans the shiny I'm I'm still having uh (9:59 - 10:07)
I'm still weird (10:03 - 10:09)
I rolled over at like 3 A.M last night (10:07 - 10:11)
and realized I forgot to turn on Pokemon (10:09 - 10:13)
sleep and I just pressed the button at (10:11 - 10:16)
maybe 2 55 am and didn't get all my (10:13 - 10:18)
sleep recorded but I got some because I (10:16 - 10:20)
remembered it (10:18 - 10:20)
oh she had that premium pass you go back (10:21 - 10:27)
and you can go back and change that for (10:24 - 10:30)
for no benefit (10:27 - 10:30)
um I made like this weird part of sleep (10:32 - 10:37)
where (10:34 - 10:40)
I now have way too much ingredients so I (10:37 - 10:42)
actually spent my I haven't bought any (10:40 - 10:43)
Gems by the way (10:42 - 10:45)
um I've only got the gems you earned for (10:43 - 10:48)
free but I've used my gems to upgrade my (10:45 - 10:51)
ingredient pouch (10:48 - 10:53)
um so instead of holding 100 I hold 140 (10:51 - 10:56)
now and I actually really like it (10:53 - 10:57)
because I feel like I did your pot (10:56 - 10:59)
though (10:57 - 11:02)
no but I have a no the pot is what like (10:59 - 11:04)
15 a day that's why you have too many (11:02 - 11:06)
ingredients (11:04 - 11:09)
because you haven't upgraded your pot (11:06 - 11:12)
what do you mean upgrade my pot (11:09 - 11:14)
I can have it hold more ingredients for (11:12 - 11:17)
me yeah I have a Magneton that will like (11:14 - 11:19)
boost it like one meal a day so I can do (11:17 - 11:22)
like 23. (11:19 - 11:24)
like that's his like that's like his (11:22 - 11:26)
power yeah but it's more than one meal a (11:24 - 11:31)
day I don't know no my magneton's bad (11:26 - 11:31)
like I wish some sometimes he does twice (11:33 - 11:38)
a day are you talking about a permanent (11:36 - 11:41)
pot of grid yeah oh I don't know how to (11:38 - 11:42)
do that well give me the details don't (11:41 - 11:45)
peace you spend sleep points on it you (11:42 - 11:47)
just tap on the pot next to the campsite (11:45 - 11:49)
and I think mine is up to 27 per meal (11:47 - 11:52)
right now what I think it's based on (11:49 - 11:56)
your player level I'm 16. is that is (11:52 - 11:57)
that what we're talking about yeah I (11:56 - 11:59)
think so I'm 15 so you should be able to (11:57 - 12:03)
upgrade it quite a lot what this is why (11:59 - 12:07)
you have too many ingredients (12:03 - 12:07)
I have like 50 milks you can hit the pot (12:07 - 12:16)
so oh I gotta go to like get cooking (12:13 - 12:20)
okay we're oh Max up yeah (12:16 - 12:22)
well that's the thing that happens at (12:20 - 12:23)
the end of the week so that's already (12:22 - 12:26)
kind of going on yeah yeah (12:23 - 12:26)
this is permanent this is 1200 dream (12:28 - 12:34)
shards yes it's kind of expensive is (12:31 - 12:37)
this permanent yeah (12:34 - 12:38)
you can use for each cooking section (12:37 - 12:40)
okay I just did the points and not dream (12:38 - 12:43)
shards funny dream shards are more (12:40 - 12:45)
valuable the higher your level is (12:43 - 12:47)
I don't remember whether I mentioned (12:45 - 12:48)
that before but don't redeem them until (12:47 - 12:50)
you have to (12:48 - 12:52)
oh that's another good tip dang you got (12:50 - 12:56)
any more no there's so much to do in (12:52 - 12:57)
this game (12:56 - 12:59)
oh I'm I'm we're we're we're we're (12:57 - 13:02)
pumping in and now I can do I can do oh (12:59 - 13:03)
you've reached the maximum current no (13:02 - 13:07)
never mind okay I'm off to 27 now yep (13:03 - 13:09)
there we go how you don't need that (13:07 - 13:10)
backspace (13:09 - 13:13)
well you know (13:10 - 13:13)
uh that's good to know (13:16 - 13:21)
uh (13:19 - 13:24)
other bit of news here is (13:21 - 13:27)
my sleep experience thanks oh sorry Greg (13:24 - 13:30)
how's your sleep experience (13:27 - 13:32)
it's fine (13:30 - 13:35)
here's for some reason still I hate (13:32 - 13:37)
playing this game (13:35 - 13:39)
so here's the thing that I realized when (13:37 - 13:41)
somebody pointed out to me I realized (13:39 - 13:43)
what my ultimate dissatisfaction of the (13:41 - 13:45)
game it's a roguelike (13:43 - 13:46)
um (13:45 - 13:49)
that you don't like roguelikes not (13:46 - 13:51)
particularly (13:49 - 13:52)
um I don't sort of like (13:51 - 13:56)
having all of my progress reset to only (13:52 - 13:57)
get a fraction of it at the beginning (13:56 - 13:58)
again (13:57 - 14:03)
I don't like that sort of (13:58 - 14:07)
dismissal of my time (14:03 - 14:07)
not all of your progress you're still (14:07 - 14:11)
leveling up those Pokemon you're still (14:09 - 14:13)
building those things (14:11 - 14:13)
but not as much as what I'd put in (14:14 - 14:17)
during the week like it's like hey (14:16 - 14:19)
thanks for doing all this work by the (14:17 - 14:20)
way you're going to start over again and (14:19 - 14:21)
you're going to get a fraction of what (14:20 - 14:23)
you did that entire week but you got a (14:21 - 14:26)
fraction isn't that enough right that's (14:23 - 14:27)
enough (14:26 - 14:29)
no it's not (14:27 - 14:32)
it's not particularly because I don't (14:29 - 14:34)
particularly enjoy having to restart (14:32 - 14:38)
over from scratch at basic level you (14:34 - 14:40)
know every improving gradually getting (14:38 - 14:42)
it yeah just a little bit better each (14:40 - 14:44)
week each time you just have to wait the (14:42 - 14:47)
full week that stinks it's like the (14:44 - 14:49)
podcast Greg every week we get funnier (14:47 - 14:51)
just by a little bit that has not (14:49 - 14:53)
happened (14:51 - 14:56)
now with that dude and but also it's not (14:53 - 14:57)
like you come in here and erase my (14:56 - 14:59)
memory so I'm starting over then you (14:57 - 15:01)
feed me a bunch of lines like this is (14:59 - 15:03)
how you were funny last week like I get (15:01 - 15:06)
to just continually be funny and improve (15:03 - 15:08)
but I haven't lost what I've been doing (15:06 - 15:10)
before (15:08 - 15:12)
plastic say it again but five percent (15:10 - 15:16)
funnier look I've had (15:12 - 15:19)
my wildest acting (15:16 - 15:23)
note I ever got from it from a director (15:19 - 15:25)
was and I will quote because this is (15:23 - 15:27)
exactly what they said to me I don't (15:25 - 15:30)
need you to act better (15:27 - 15:34)
I need you to act faster (15:30 - 15:34)
he goes right (15:34 - 15:40)
but I don't I don't know what that means (15:36 - 15:43)
theater people know what that means (15:40 - 15:46)
it's fine like I'm still doing it but (15:43 - 15:49)
there is a dissatisfaction of at the end (15:46 - 15:53)
of the week being like Oh and I'm back (15:49 - 15:55)
to basic again and I'm starting and (15:53 - 15:57)
doing all of this again and the way the (15:55 - 15:59)
game is set up I'm going to see a lot of (15:57 - 16:01)
the same things that had already seen (15:59 - 16:03)
and I do have to (16:01 - 16:06)
I do feel the game pressuring me to pay (16:03 - 16:08)
for things to make me get to the thing (16:06 - 16:11)
that I was at just a day ago but you (16:08 - 16:13)
took that away from me (16:11 - 16:14)
for fun (16:13 - 16:17)
it is not like I'm leaving and there's (16:14 - 16:19)
no way I'm taking my go plus plus with (16:17 - 16:21)
me to Atlanta like there's gonna be five (16:19 - 16:24)
days of no recording and I'm completely (16:21 - 16:25)
fine with that you could get different (16:24 - 16:27)
Pokemon though because you could have a (16:25 - 16:30)
different sleep pattern in that new bed (16:27 - 16:32)
but I won't because it's literally AI (16:30 - 16:35)
driven like I look at it and go how did (16:32 - 16:37)
you even decide this I had the exact (16:35 - 16:42)
same sleep you are just making this up (16:37 - 16:42)
your Snorlax will need you (16:44 - 16:50)
Snorlax is fine besides apparently at (16:46 - 16:52)
the end of the week it has this memory (16:50 - 16:53)
erased and shipped off somewhere that (16:52 - 16:55)
I'll never see it again I didn't have to (16:53 - 16:56)
wait a couple of days and it doesn't (16:55 - 16:58)
know who I am he's out looking for a hat (16:56 - 17:01)
so he can appear in Pokemon go look I (16:58 - 17:04)
got both hats and one of them was shiny (17:01 - 17:06)
Yeehaw okay before we get to the Pokemon (17:04 - 17:10)
go uh the soft nintendosoup.com (17:06 - 17:13)
your anniversary I think I said last (17:10 - 17:14)
week that we were on the three year (17:13 - 17:16)
anniversary I don't know what time is (17:14 - 17:20)
apparently we're on four it's four baby (17:16 - 17:23)
uh that will kick off on (17:20 - 17:25)
today the day you're listening to this (17:23 - 17:29)
podcast the 28th it will feature a (17:25 - 17:31)
Prelude Prelude to the finale of the (17:29 - 17:34)
villain Arc as well as introduce Neo (17:31 - 17:37)
Champion sink pairs red leaf and blue (17:34 - 17:39)
and then they had a little trailer for (17:37 - 17:41)
that so yeah it was pretty good (17:39 - 17:44)
uh those characters will have Articuno (17:41 - 17:46)
Moltres Zapdos (17:44 - 17:47)
which (17:46 - 17:49)
you know for the last couple months we (17:47 - 17:51)
were like how are they gonna do this (17:49 - 17:53)
next anniversary (17:51 - 17:54)
oh (17:53 - 17:57)
how how could we be so naive you just (17:54 - 17:59)
stick another red blue and leaf in here (17:57 - 18:02)
and you're printing money (17:59 - 18:04)
let's go back to Kanto let's go back to (18:02 - 18:06)
gen one that's all you need yeah yeah (18:04 - 18:08)
pretty much (18:06 - 18:12)
I mean I want I want red Articuno man (18:08 - 18:15)
they look good they look good I mean I (18:12 - 18:17)
think their costumes are a little dull (18:15 - 18:19)
but (18:17 - 18:19)
I think the costumes for the Galler (18:19 - 18:25)
birds were better but (18:22 - 18:28)
that's true the the gallerian maltre (18:25 - 18:30)
Zapdos Articuno very good those are (18:28 - 18:31)
still mad (18:30 - 18:34)
I missed out on the Jirachi I was like (18:31 - 18:37)
oh I Jirachi ends tomorrow no that was (18:34 - 18:38)
awesome (18:37 - 18:41)
nope I actually ended last week nope (18:38 - 18:44)
denied like you said what is time yeah (18:41 - 18:46)
yeah look it'll come back (18:44 - 18:50)
yeah so blue has Zapdos red has Articuno (18:46 - 18:56)
green has mole Trace cause reasons (18:50 - 18:56)
sure yeah we don't know those reasons (18:56 - 19:02)
yet but they have them for reasons I'm (18:58 - 19:03)
sure the story will be decent yeah the (19:02 - 19:06)
stories are generally fine (19:03 - 19:07)
um it should be pretty good I mean (19:06 - 19:09)
they're sort of hinting that they want (19:07 - 19:11)
these (19:09 - 19:14)
three to take up a bigger roll of (19:11 - 19:17)
showing new trainers how to be good new (19:14 - 19:19)
trainers (19:17 - 19:20)
um (19:19 - 19:25)
red and Articuno are a strike sync pair (19:20 - 19:29)
uh uh leaf and Moltres or Tech sync pair (19:25 - 19:32)
and blue and Zapdos are a support sync (19:29 - 19:35)
pair (19:32 - 19:35)
I mean you think you would put the (19:37 - 19:41)
Articuno with the blue and the Moltres (19:39 - 19:44)
with the red and (19:41 - 19:47)
did they (19:44 - 19:51)
I don't know it's whatever (19:47 - 19:51)
there has to be a reason (19:51 - 19:55)
Maybe (19:54 - 19:58)
there probably will be we'll learn about (19:55 - 20:00)
it they'll give us the whole reasons why (19:58 - 20:02)
or sometimes they don't just like oh I (20:00 - 20:07)
found it and this is who I am now uh (20:02 - 20:07)
but this hurt is weird because they sort (20:07 - 20:11)
of kept them even though they're getting (20:09 - 20:14)
new Pokemon they sort of just kept them (20:11 - 20:17)
in their same sort of roles like (20:14 - 20:21)
red is just a striker (20:17 - 20:24)
blue does do a lot of support in the (20:21 - 20:26)
game and is generally a tank and leaf is (20:24 - 20:30)
also sort of a debuffer so like it's (20:26 - 20:33)
nice that they kept them in their roles (20:30 - 20:34)
so that at least you have an idea when (20:33 - 20:36)
you're getting these sync pairs like (20:34 - 20:38)
what you're getting into (20:36 - 20:40)
um (20:38 - 20:40)
so it's like okay I get it it's it's (20:40 - 20:47)
that's a good part I'm hoping the story (20:44 - 20:48)
at least sort of explains how they got (20:47 - 20:50)
them although they have officially (20:48 - 20:53)
stated that all the legendaries on paizo (20:50 - 20:57)
are unique passio are unique (20:53 - 21:00)
and not like ones and any other reasons (20:57 - 21:04)
like all the tapu that showed up (21:00 - 21:07)
aren't the alolan versions they are a (21:04 - 21:10)
different they are a different set of (21:07 - 21:11)
tattoos so all the legendaries that are (21:10 - 21:14)
here are different for whatever reason (21:11 - 21:16)
have they explained that further no but (21:14 - 21:19)
they are that's how we have so many of (21:16 - 21:20)
them however we have all these (21:19 - 21:22)
legendaries that (21:20 - 21:24)
there's only one back in their own (21:22 - 21:27)
universes but there's a plenty here the (21:24 - 21:28)
only thing that matters is Sophocles and (21:27 - 21:30)
Cyrus are friends they are and that's (21:28 - 21:32)
what's keeping Cyrus from destroying the (21:30 - 21:34)
universe (21:32 - 21:37)
all right well uh (21:34 - 21:39)
let's take a break (21:37 - 21:43)
and when we come back we will go through (21:39 - 21:48)
Global go Fest and I'm curious to hear (21:43 - 21:50)
about New York go Fest (21:48 - 21:53)
so we will do all of that (21:50 - 21:54)
um and we already talked about how the (21:53 - 21:56)
DLC is coming out on the 13th which is a (21:54 - 21:59)
Wednesday which is not weird because I (21:56 - 22:00)
love armor (21:59 - 22:02)
and (22:00 - 22:03)
uh (22:02 - 22:05)
uh came out on a Wednesday I think round (22:03 - 22:08)
Tundra came out on a Thursday (22:05 - 22:09)
but (22:08 - 22:11)
um there's there's your Scotland violent (22:09 - 22:14)
news uh the DLC is soon (22:11 - 22:15)
um we have no time frame of actually (22:14 - 22:17)
when it's coming we don't know if that's (22:15 - 22:20)
UTC who knows (22:17 - 22:23)
um so maybe next time we record we'll (22:20 - 22:26)
have more details but anyways uh we're (22:23 - 22:27)
gonna take a break when we come back (22:26 - 22:29)
we're going to talk about some Pokemon (22:27 - 22:31)
go I want to say Pokemon like my mom (22:29 - 22:34)
some Pokemon go we'll be right back and (22:31 - 22:38)
we are back from our break (22:34 - 22:41)
all right uh multiple go passes have (22:38 - 22:46)
happened Osaka London New York it would (22:41 - 22:48)
be nice to have a uh hello London person (22:46 - 22:51)
on the show but time zones (22:48 - 22:53)
and also I just got back from Japan and (22:51 - 22:55)
also I'm leaving again so (22:53 - 22:59)
it all has offered tone has offered yeah (22:55 - 23:03)
but it's 4 a.m on a Monday for Tony I (22:59 - 23:07)
think that man has a nine-to-five job (23:03 - 23:07)
good (23:07 - 23:11)
I would love to get tone on though it's (23:09 - 23:14)
uh so we can compare all three but you (23:11 - 23:16)
Hannah went to the New York this is your (23:14 - 23:19)
first go Fest yes (23:16 - 23:22)
so I guess the question was first (23:19 - 23:25)
question was was it worth traveling (23:22 - 23:31)
hotel to play Pokemon go in New York (23:25 - 23:33)
I think a hundred percent yes but (23:31 - 23:35)
largely because of the community that I (23:33 - 23:38)
was able to be with there and get to (23:35 - 23:39)
meet (23:38 - 23:40)
I don't know how it would have felt if I (23:39 - 23:44)
had just gone on my own (23:40 - 23:46)
it was amazing (23:44 - 23:49)
um I'm super happy about it uh the city (23:46 - 23:53)
experience was probably the better part (23:49 - 23:55)
in a lot of ways just because we were (23:53 - 23:57)
able to meet up with everybody and (23:55 - 23:59)
because not everybody was able to (23:57 - 24:01)
schedule for the same time slot in the (23:59 - 24:02)
park (24:01 - 24:05)
the park was also kind of out of the way (24:02 - 24:10)
not so much as I think Vegas was but um (24:05 - 24:12)
none of the ways of getting there were (24:10 - 24:15)
particularly great (24:12 - 24:16)
they did have shuttles I think the (24:15 - 24:17)
shuttles were probably the most (24:16 - 24:21)
accessible but I did not check those out (24:17 - 24:23)
um our group walked all the way up from (24:21 - 24:25)
the Nintendo store all the way up (24:23 - 24:27)
through Central Park all the way up to (24:25 - 24:30)
the island so that was a long day (24:27 - 24:32)
of walking (24:30 - 24:35)
I was dehydrated (24:32 - 24:36)
yes (24:35 - 24:37)
yep (24:36 - 24:39)
I mean the walking across the bridge (24:37 - 24:41)
wasn't the worst part Central Park is (24:39 - 24:45)
really big the Central Park is huge (24:41 - 24:47)
it's a big Park I ended up chugging two (24:45 - 24:49)
bottles of Gatorade halfway through (24:47 - 24:52)
because it was very humid and hot there (24:49 - 24:54)
uh can you (24:52 - 24:57)
give well this is maybe a tougher (24:54 - 24:58)
question because you didn't go to any of (24:57 - 24:59)
the other go fests because it's your (24:58 - 25:03)
first go fast uh in person go fast (24:59 - 25:06)
um did I I heard the park was just kind (25:03 - 25:08)
of small (25:06 - 25:09)
um in general the like the park you (25:08 - 25:11)
actually not Central Park the the park (25:09 - 25:14)
where the go Fest was yeah (25:11 - 25:17)
it was different sizes depending on (25:14 - 25:19)
which entrance you came through because (25:17 - 25:21)
we walked over the bridge onto the (25:19 - 25:23)
island and came up through the South (25:21 - 25:26)
entrance I think that it felt bigger (25:23 - 25:29)
but the part that connected the north (25:26 - 25:31)
entrance and the South entrance was (25:29 - 25:33)
really weirdly narrow and weirdly (25:31 - 25:37)
crowded and two of the biomes were in (25:33 - 25:39)
that space Oh (25:37 - 25:41)
so that was not great (25:39 - 25:43)
the park experience also crashed for (25:41 - 25:47)
Verizon users on Saturday and that was (25:43 - 25:50)
pretty bad for a lot of people (25:47 - 25:52)
yeah I heard there was like a three-hour (25:50 - 25:54)
extension for Verizon players after for (25:52 - 25:57)
the city experience yeah but it kind of (25:54 - 25:59)
ruined the park experience for the most (25:57 - 26:01)
part (25:59 - 26:04)
um it was really cool (26:01 - 26:04)
yeah yeah pretty much I mean get your (26:05 - 26:10)
photo ops get your T-shirt get all of (26:08 - 26:12)
the research done that was what our (26:10 - 26:14)
group focused on we had a couple of (26:12 - 26:16)
people who were really good at leading (26:14 - 26:17)
the group and saying okay do you have (26:16 - 26:19)
your research done do we all have our (26:17 - 26:21)
research done have we all caught all of (26:19 - 26:23)
the Pokemon for the collection Challenge (26:21 - 26:25)
and are we ready to move on to the next (26:23 - 26:27)
biome and that was the challenge when (26:25 - 26:29)
going there with a whole group (26:27 - 26:33)
but the park was fine it was (26:29 - 26:35)
uh there was a lot more concrete than I (26:33 - 26:37)
expected which was probably good for (26:35 - 26:40)
accessibility reasons so I appreciated (26:37 - 26:42)
that though it seemed like (26:40 - 26:45)
some parts of it were a little muddy and (26:42 - 26:47)
hard to get through (26:45 - 26:48)
the (26:47 - 26:51)
for me personally the whole game just (26:48 - 26:52)
started crashing as soon as the event (26:51 - 26:54)
started but I don't think anyone else (26:52 - 26:56)
had that issue no that's pretty normal (26:54 - 26:59)
that's pretty normal no it was it was (26:56 - 27:01)
different mine was different this was (26:59 - 27:03)
different I promise (27:01 - 27:06)
one of the first tasks was to send gifts (27:03 - 27:08)
to friends every single time I tried to (27:06 - 27:11)
touch a gift the entire app would crash (27:08 - 27:13)
yep that was my first go Fest experience (27:11 - 27:16)
and I had to de-install and reinstall go (27:13 - 27:19)
fist while walking through the park my (27:16 - 27:20)
very first go Fest yep nope you're (27:19 - 27:22)
uninstall and reinstall the app okay (27:20 - 27:25)
you're you're not that special that does (27:22 - 27:28)
happen nobody nobody else who was there (27:25 - 27:31)
happened I had that happen I was in (27:28 - 27:33)
there refreshing my game data and (27:31 - 27:35)
closing and reopening the app and (27:33 - 27:37)
restarting my phone and ultimately only (27:35 - 27:39)
on installing and reinstalling was the (27:37 - 27:43)
thing that fixed it yep yeah um (27:39 - 27:48)
jetsy who came out to Minneapolis uh to (27:43 - 27:51)
play the global go Fest here in Seattle (27:48 - 27:54)
last year anytime they touched a raid (27:51 - 27:57)
their whole app crashed (27:54 - 27:58)
so like they could play the game (27:57 - 28:00)
normally but when they went to tap on a (27:58 - 28:02)
raid it crashed and tech support was (28:00 - 28:03)
eventually was like I don't install (28:02 - 28:06)
reinstall the Evan fixed it but I don't (28:03 - 28:09)
yeah it just seems like (28:06 - 28:11)
like we say that as like people are (28:09 - 28:13)
probably like oh this is why Niantic (28:11 - 28:14)
sucks is why I would never go to go fast (28:13 - 28:16)
but like when we were doing raids there (28:14 - 28:19)
was like 50 of us and he was the only (28:16 - 28:22)
one with that issue and (28:19 - 28:24)
I I would honestly I would say after (28:22 - 28:25)
like (28:24 - 28:27)
the very first go Fest in the second go (28:25 - 28:30)
Fest and the third go Fest like there's (28:27 - 28:31)
not like a huge line at tech support (28:30 - 28:33)
like usually if somebody's having an (28:31 - 28:36)
issue tech support you're you're talking (28:33 - 28:38)
to a person within like five minutes and (28:36 - 28:40)
you're usually walking out with a (28:38 - 28:42)
solution that solution is probably (28:40 - 28:45)
reinstall the app yeah and it's fine but (28:42 - 28:47)
it's not like (28:45 - 28:49)
hundreds of thousands well in the case (28:47 - 28:51)
of everyone have Verizon that sounds (28:49 - 28:53)
like that was a Verizon issue (28:51 - 28:56)
specifically not a Niantic issue the (28:53 - 28:58)
Verizon issue was was not great there (28:56 - 29:00)
were people connecting to other people's (28:58 - 29:02)
hot spots just so they could play and it (29:00 - 29:04)
went out on for a good long time hey (29:02 - 29:07)
that very first go Fest Sprint people (29:04 - 29:10)
had no problems because Sprint brought (29:07 - 29:13)
the cows yeah bring out the cows so it's (29:10 - 29:16)
always it's still funny that like that (29:13 - 29:17)
was just the issue that was the really (29:16 - 29:19)
the issue of the first go Fest was ATT (29:17 - 29:22)
and Verizon refused to bring cows out (29:19 - 29:24)
even though Niantic asked for it and (29:22 - 29:26)
they said no our network is strong (29:24 - 29:28)
enough (29:26 - 29:30)
and the only company that brought a cow (29:28 - 29:34)
was Sprint and people on Sprint which (29:30 - 29:37)
it's not you know Verizon and ATT are (29:34 - 29:39)
much bigger customers have more (29:37 - 29:42)
customers than Sprint did at the time (29:39 - 29:44)
um they couldn't play and they had to go (29:42 - 29:45)
out in the city (29:44 - 29:47)
but what you said earlier Hannah (29:45 - 29:50)
the you said a lot of people seem to (29:47 - 29:52)
prefer the city experience they started (29:50 - 29:55)
doing that pretty recently (29:52 - 29:56)
um (29:55 - 29:58)
yeah and the experience was totally (29:56 - 30:00)
worth the extra (29:58 - 30:02)
money for the few other days that we (30:00 - 30:05)
played yeah no that was I was going to (30:02 - 30:06)
say is like I've heard that a lot from (30:05 - 30:09)
people that they prefer the city (30:06 - 30:12)
experience so it is kind of (30:09 - 30:14)
nice I guess that the park experience is (30:12 - 30:17)
what like four hours out of one of your (30:14 - 30:21)
days because the park is still cool (30:17 - 30:22)
um (30:21 - 30:25)
but the city experience (30:22 - 30:27)
I feel like isn't going to go away I (30:25 - 30:30)
feel like it is kind of a a crucial part (30:27 - 30:32)
to (30:30 - 30:34)
that go Fest experience and they can get (30:32 - 30:36)
more players in and they can get more (30:34 - 30:38)
people through and then people can you (30:36 - 30:40)
know instead of playing eight hours (30:38 - 30:42)
super hard on one day they can do like (30:40 - 30:45)
six hours four hours six hours and not (30:42 - 30:47)
feel like (30:45 - 30:49)
they got to cram everything in and be (30:47 - 30:52)
exhausted it makes a full trip feel much (30:49 - 30:54)
more worth it than just being able to go (30:52 - 30:57)
to the park on part of one of the days (30:54 - 30:58)
another good thing they did in the park (30:57 - 31:00)
though while they weren't throwing water (30:58 - 31:02)
bottles at us they did have really good (31:00 - 31:05)
Hydration Stations (31:02 - 31:05)
Osaka was passing out water bottles like (31:07 - 31:11)
it was (31:10 - 31:13)
going out of style (31:11 - 31:14)
um (31:13 - 31:16)
yeah I wonder if that's a good Japan (31:14 - 31:18)
thing or maybe they're just that Park (31:16 - 31:19)
didn't have like water stations I'm not (31:18 - 31:21)
100 sure yeah they brought in these (31:19 - 31:23)
giant water trucks and the water was all (31:21 - 31:27)
cooled and everything it was real fancy (31:23 - 31:29)
huh yeah you know for Osaka I kind of (31:27 - 31:32)
regret going to the park every time but (31:29 - 31:34)
because I was like streaming it and (31:32 - 31:35)
because I know like there's different (31:34 - 31:36)
audiences every day I'm streaming it (31:35 - 31:40)
like showing that Park is really cool (31:36 - 31:42)
but I'm pretty sure the Osaka Park was (31:40 - 31:46)
multiple times bigger than Randall's (31:42 - 31:48)
Island in here uh it sounds like well (31:46 - 31:50)
maybe multiple times bigger than the (31:48 - 31:52)
part of Randall's Island that we were (31:50 - 31:53)
allowed to do yeah yeah (31:52 - 31:56)
because it was nowhere near the full (31:53 - 31:57)
island there was a whole lot of other (31:56 - 31:59)
stuff going on on the full island there (31:57 - 32:01)
were people having baseball games there (31:59 - 32:02)
it was (32:01 - 32:05)
kind of wild (32:02 - 32:05)
so um now that you've been to a go Fest (32:06 - 32:11)
is this something that you're penciling (32:09 - 32:15)
in for the future or you know if they (32:11 - 32:20)
decide to do a a Sinnoh tour in person (32:15 - 32:22)
if I had enough money I would go to (32:20 - 32:26)
every Pokemon go event that's the (32:22 - 32:28)
deciding factor there I will probably (32:26 - 32:30)
try to go to go Fest next year though if (32:28 - 32:33)
we can get our community together again (32:30 - 32:36)
because that was a really good time (32:33 - 32:39)
yeah Greg and I were there and yeah we (32:36 - 32:42)
were walking around every single photo (32:39 - 32:44)
opportunity (32:42 - 32:46)
yeah you guys had like a cool rock (32:44 - 32:48)
crystal display or something we didn't (32:46 - 32:49)
have that in Osaka (32:48 - 32:51)
we just had like a really bad blow up (32:49 - 32:52)
Pikachu (32:51 - 32:55)
it was like dirty (32:52 - 32:57)
it sounded like the the photo (32:55 - 32:59)
attractions were better in New York than (32:57 - 33:01)
they were in Osaka but not as good as (32:59 - 33:03)
London's (33:01 - 33:06)
yeah we um I don't know if London or you (33:03 - 33:08)
guys had it but we had like a memory (33:06 - 33:10)
lane which had like every Pogo screen (33:08 - 33:13)
ever yeah we had one of those but oh (33:10 - 33:15)
okay you guys did have that it wasn't (33:13 - 33:18)
labeled super well and I don't think we (33:15 - 33:20)
went back there after the very beginning (33:18 - 33:23)
of the park experience (33:20 - 33:23)
yeah we had the giant Pikachu we had (33:23 - 33:29)
Memory Lane we had the standees (33:25 - 33:33)
we had a Snorlax and a Lucario and the (33:29 - 33:34)
Crystal thing (33:33 - 33:37)
yeah we didn't have any of that (33:34 - 33:37)
we got we have free water bottle and (33:38 - 33:43)
free barley tea that was kind of bad but (33:40 - 33:44)
they were handing that out like candy (33:43 - 33:46)
too they were like please take this tea (33:44 - 33:49)
it was one of the sponsors of the park I (33:46 - 33:51)
like barley tea so do I it was very (33:49 - 33:54)
bitter yes but yeah (33:51 - 33:58)
that's the point here you could take as (33:54 - 33:59)
many bottles as you wanted you would (33:58 - 34:01)
have loved it (33:59 - 34:03)
laughs (34:01 - 34:05)
the merch tent line was ridiculously (34:03 - 34:08)
long yeah it was just for the shirt (34:05 - 34:09)
right (34:08 - 34:12)
uh so there was a separate tent for the (34:09 - 34:14)
shirt (34:12 - 34:14)
yes yes so we were able to go up and (34:14 - 34:19)
grab the shirt by just showing off a QR (34:17 - 34:21)
code in pretty much no time that took (34:19 - 34:22)
less than three minutes to just get (34:21 - 34:23)
through that short line that was a very (34:22 - 34:25)
smart thing that Niantic did though yeah (34:23 - 34:28)
QR code for shirts was was very (34:25 - 34:30)
Cody that I'm assuming pre-ordered the (34:28 - 34:33)
shirt right you pre-order and then the (34:30 - 34:35)
app gives you a QR code and then you (34:33 - 34:37)
just grab it (34:35 - 34:39)
which is great because you don't want to (34:37 - 34:40)
pay (34:39 - 34:43)
70 dollars for a ticket and then wait in (34:40 - 34:45)
line for two hours to pick up the shirt (34:43 - 34:48)
yeah no because the merch line was (34:45 - 34:50)
definitely a one to two hour line for (34:48 - 34:52)
the big merch tent that just had (34:50 - 34:55)
t-shirts and plushies and pins and a (34:52 - 34:57)
couple of hats was it just Pokemon (34:55 - 34:59)
Center uh pretty much yeah I got the (34:57 - 35:01)
shirt that Greg has on (34:59 - 35:04)
because that's right there okay yeah oh (35:01 - 35:07)
so you know when Greg and I went to the (35:04 - 35:10)
the St Louis Safari Zone (35:07 - 35:12)
they had a huge tent in the center they (35:10 - 35:14)
had a bunch of merch right they had the (35:12 - 35:16)
plot the Pikachu with the Fedora the (35:14 - 35:18)
shirt that Greg's wearing which is for (35:16 - 35:20)
the audio only listeners it's just like (35:18 - 35:22)
the tan shirt with mammal swine and and (35:20 - 35:23)
stuff (35:22 - 35:25)
um but the cool thing about that which (35:23 - 35:26)
I'm actually surprised that I haven't (35:25 - 35:28)
really done in the future like kind of (35:26 - 35:30)
only did it at that maybe they did other (35:28 - 35:31)
Safari zones (35:30 - 35:33)
that was weird because that was like (35:31 - 35:34)
when like they started doing Safari (35:33 - 35:35)
zones then Cove had happened and then (35:34 - 35:37)
they all got canceled and then they kind (35:35 - 35:41)
of did them again but then stopped was (35:37 - 35:43)
they had like a huge billboard of (35:41 - 35:45)
everything that was in the store (35:43 - 35:48)
and you could just scan a QR code and (35:45 - 35:50)
then place an order on your phone and (35:48 - 35:52)
then they would text you when it was (35:50 - 35:54)
ready and then instead of waiting in (35:52 - 35:56)
line you got in a different line just to (35:54 - 35:59)
pick it up impressive it was so nice (35:56 - 36:02)
cool and I've never seen it never seen (35:59 - 36:04)
another Pokemon go event didn't do that (36:02 - 36:06)
besides the the St Louis one it was (36:04 - 36:08)
awesome it was great they had a website (36:06 - 36:09)
you could go to where you could look at (36:08 - 36:11)
the things that were supposedly inside (36:09 - 36:13)
the tent but it was not updated (36:11 - 36:16)
oh there was actually I think more in (36:13 - 36:18)
the tent than there was on the website (36:16 - 36:21)
so it was not necessarily a bad thing (36:18 - 36:23)
but if you went in there planning what (36:21 - 36:25)
you were gonna get it was uh not always (36:23 - 36:26)
possible (36:25 - 36:29)
that's so weird Steve you have the right (36:26 - 36:31)
suggestion with uh going to the park in (36:29 - 36:34)
the morning we did not do that (36:31 - 36:36)
it was (36:34 - 36:38)
there was no food left (36:36 - 36:40)
yeah for future anyone listen to this (36:38 - 36:42)
podcast if you're considering going to a (36:40 - 36:45)
go Fest do not pick Park in the (36:42 - 36:48)
afternoon always pick Park in the (36:45 - 36:50)
morning it's cooler (36:48 - 36:54)
it's it's you're you're there first like (36:50 - 36:56)
it (36:54 - 36:59)
just trust me on this one (36:56 - 36:59)
probably shorter if you want to sit in (37:01 - 37:09)
the line for two to three hours but uh (37:04 - 37:11)
there was just no food at all on (37:09 - 37:14)
Saturday afternoon at any of the food (37:11 - 37:15)
trucks and there were a bunch of food (37:14 - 37:18)
trucks also don't pick Saturday pick (37:15 - 37:22)
Friday or pick uh Sunday and Saturday (37:18 - 37:24)
afternoon is the busy one yeah yeah (37:22 - 37:26)
Saturday afternoon is like the the worst (37:24 - 37:29)
slot you can pick but like fry so Friday (37:26 - 37:31)
is like if you have technical issues on (37:29 - 37:33)
Friday you're more likely to get the (37:31 - 37:35)
free day (37:33 - 37:38)
that's why a lot of us chose the (37:35 - 37:40)
Saturday afternoon spot we figured the (37:38 - 37:42)
technical issues would be solved no I (37:40 - 37:43)
don't know (37:42 - 37:46)
free stuff yeah so you game the system (37:43 - 37:48)
you want to have problems so you can (37:46 - 37:49)
complain at them they give you free (37:48 - 37:52)
stuff (37:49 - 37:52)
um (37:53 - 37:58)
speaking of technical issues uh it (37:54 - 38:01)
seemed like the global go Fest was (37:58 - 38:02)
pretty (38:01 - 38:06)
Tech technical issue free like (38:02 - 38:09)
it seemed to really break it all (38:06 - 38:10)
which might be they did a pretty good (38:09 - 38:12)
job with this one a lot of people were (38:10 - 38:15)
really happy yeah I (38:12 - 38:18)
I thought this was a good go Fest yeah I (38:15 - 38:19)
thought I thought this one was really (38:18 - 38:21)
great for Global (38:19 - 38:22)
um (38:21 - 38:25)
and I don't know you know it it's not (38:22 - 38:27)
every time we talk about glow fat go (38:25 - 38:28)
fast (38:27 - 38:30)
it's it's always like this this counter (38:28 - 38:32)
to like (38:30 - 38:34)
not a counter but I I feel like some (38:32 - 38:36)
people are like my go Fest was amazing (38:34 - 38:37)
because I got all these shinies or (38:36 - 38:38)
somebody will be like my girlfriends (38:37 - 38:41)
sucked I only got like two shinies but (38:38 - 38:44)
it's never that for me like (38:41 - 38:45)
um (38:44 - 38:47)
because there's like shinies or whatever (38:45 - 38:49)
um it's it's from the person who got the (38:47 - 38:52)
hundo shiny Goomy and all the Pikachus (38:49 - 38:53)
that's because you gotta complain the (38:52 - 38:55)
entirety yeah I gotta complain from top (38:53 - 38:58)
to bottom and then things will happen (38:55 - 38:59)
yeah (38:58 - 39:00)
um (38:59 - 39:03)
but like (39:00 - 39:03)
I really just enjoyed the I think I (39:04 - 39:09)
think they had good Pokemon selection (39:08 - 39:12)
obviously not every single Pokemon is (39:09 - 39:15)
going to be like a hit right (39:12 - 39:17)
um but I think the Pokemon selection (39:15 - 39:18)
were really good (39:17 - 39:21)
I did actually like (39:18 - 39:24)
I like costume Pikachu I like I like a (39:21 - 39:27)
lot of costume Pokemon so having like a (39:24 - 39:29)
different Pikachu every hour I thought (39:27 - 39:31)
was pretty clever even though even (39:29 - 39:33)
though like give it to somebody else (39:31 - 39:36)
like maybe have I I don't even do like (39:33 - 39:38)
Charmander Squirtle Bulbasaur or Pikachu (39:36 - 39:42)
like a little variety might be nice (39:38 - 39:43)
um (39:42 - 39:45)
it's weird that they brought back (39:43 - 39:48)
Snorlax but at first I was like oh it's (39:45 - 39:49)
weird They're bringing back snorlaxes (39:48 - 39:50)
doesn't everyone have this but like the (39:49 - 39:52)
amount of people that were so excited (39:50 - 39:55)
Snorlax was there everyone had that yeah (39:52 - 39:56)
yeah that was that was pretty wild to (39:55 - 39:58)
see that was like I didn't care about (39:56 - 39:59)
this one last year (39:58 - 40:02)
but so I'm I'm gonna assume maybe if (39:59 - 40:04)
they're gonna do this like one odd (40:02 - 40:06)
costume off they're gonna do Aerodactyl (40:04 - 40:07)
next year because Aerodactyl was only (40:06 - 40:10)
for the in person probably hopefully (40:07 - 40:13)
because it was a hit yeah yeah it seemed (40:10 - 40:15)
about well Snorlax is a very popular (40:13 - 40:18)
Pokemon just in general too so (40:15 - 40:18)
um (40:18 - 40:22)
but Greg and I went to Centennial Lakes (40:18 - 40:26)
which is uh uh a very popular place to (40:22 - 40:28)
play Pokemon go in the Twin City area (40:26 - 40:30)
they do have their own Community they (40:28 - 40:32)
have their own Discord that's pretty (40:30 - 40:33)
active that's where we went for Reggie (40:32 - 40:35)
Drago rajieliki they were one of the (40:33 - 40:38)
most active discords for those two (40:35 - 40:40)
Pokemon (40:38 - 40:44)
and gorgeous Park plenty of stops plenty (40:40 - 40:47)
of gyms plenty of restaurants nearby we (40:44 - 40:50)
had amazing weather it was like high of (40:47 - 40:54)
75 absolutely gorgeous out so (40:50 - 40:56)
um (40:54 - 40:56)
I laid down the most lures I've ever (40:57 - 41:02)
laid down in a day in the seven years of (40:59 - 41:04)
playing this game I was a little (41:02 - 41:06)
disappointed at the turnout like there (41:04 - 41:09)
were still a lot of people playing (41:06 - 41:12)
but not as much as a community day there (41:09 - 41:15)
like a community day there it's popping (41:12 - 41:17)
and I've never had a late on allure in (41:15 - 41:20)
Centennial Parks on a community there (41:17 - 41:24)
I've like I was actively doing lures at (41:20 - 41:26)
least two to three an hour because I (41:24 - 41:29)
think lures lasted an hour yeah (41:26 - 41:31)
um and (41:29 - 41:34)
yeah I also just didn't think the spawn (41:31 - 41:37)
density was as good as a community day (41:34 - 41:39)
it was still very good because it's a (41:37 - 41:41)
pretty popular Park but (41:39 - 41:42)
um (41:41 - 41:44)
if I was really aiming for like (41:42 - 41:47)
maximizing shinies I would have just (41:44 - 41:48)
went to Mall of America (41:47 - 41:51)
because there's just so many like (41:48 - 41:54)
literally if you cannot keep walking and (41:51 - 41:56)
tap everything like there's just so many (41:54 - 41:58)
spawns in Mall of America (41:56 - 42:02)
um but like don't regret the choice (41:58 - 42:06)
um well the thing is they still do (42:02 - 42:10)
they still do phone density right and so (42:06 - 42:13)
because there are so many people at the (42:10 - 42:15)
mall who aren't playing who are just (42:13 - 42:17)
there but they're not playing the game (42:15 - 42:20)
there's just a ton of people it is going (42:17 - 42:21)
to generate more (42:20 - 42:25)
yeah everything whereas like Centennial (42:21 - 42:28)
Lakes was packed with people a lot of (42:25 - 42:31)
people there were playing the game there (42:28 - 42:33)
were people who just generally (42:31 - 42:36)
view the visit the park but I would say (42:33 - 42:39)
that it was a majority of players were (42:36 - 42:42)
there the thing is is that one of the (42:39 - 42:44)
things that I felt is I didn't need to (42:42 - 42:46)
do both sets of hours (42:44 - 42:49)
right and I think a lot of people didn't (42:46 - 42:53)
do they either picked the morning or the (42:49 - 42:56)
afternoon or the Chunk in between so (42:53 - 42:57)
instead of having the concentration of a (42:56 - 42:59)
community day they could spread out (42:57 - 43:02)
which is my preferred method because it (42:59 - 43:05)
didn't feel (43:02 - 43:05)
so overwhelming with people stopping and (43:05 - 43:13)
people just generally being in the way (43:10 - 43:15)
and people feeling really manic at (43:13 - 43:18)
getting things like it felt a bit manic (43:15 - 43:22)
at Mall of America today (43:18 - 43:24)
um which is a less enjoyable experience (43:22 - 43:27)
for me like I enjoyed much more having a (43:24 - 43:30)
leisurely stroll being able to check (43:27 - 43:34)
everything and not feel like (43:30 - 43:36)
I couldn't get to that in time because (43:34 - 43:38)
it despawned or I had to click through (43:36 - 43:40)
four things overlapping to get to the (43:38 - 43:42)
thing that I wanted and I had to waste (43:40 - 43:44)
time catching things to clear things out (43:42 - 43:48)
like that's not my ideal experience so I (43:44 - 43:49)
enjoyed Saturday a lot more because it (43:48 - 43:52)
just felt more relaxed and leisurely (43:49 - 43:53)
like I was having (43:52 - 43:57)
a nice day playing (43:53 - 44:00)
and could sort of just get everything (43:57 - 44:02)
and make sure that my completion (44:00 - 44:04)
challenges were checked off and I knew (44:02 - 44:06)
exactly what I was looking for and I (44:04 - 44:08)
could see it clearly on the map whereas (44:06 - 44:10)
if I had to do that today I would have (44:08 - 44:13)
just been like no this no I'm done I (44:10 - 44:16)
can't this is this is bad yeah the day (44:13 - 44:17)
without the collection challenges is (44:16 - 44:21)
supposed to be the chiller one (44:17 - 44:21)
but not if you go to the busy place (44:21 - 44:26)
what was it wasn't last year like the (44:24 - 44:27)
ultra Beast stuff if I remember (44:26 - 44:31)
correctly and it was just kind of bad (44:27 - 44:34)
like it wasn't it wasn't bad it was just (44:31 - 44:38)
very like you you got to use the the (44:34 - 44:41)
Beast balls though and they kind of did (44:38 - 44:43)
that again (44:41 - 44:45)
wait was that (44:43 - 44:47)
no that was uh (44:45 - 44:50)
not go Fest was it (44:47 - 44:53)
that was no the the beast when you got (44:50 - 44:55)
to use the Beast balls was not go Fest (44:53 - 44:56)
because I remember go fest last year (44:55 - 44:59)
Greg and I went to the Art Park for the (44:56 - 45:02)
first day when I remember that our Park (44:59 - 45:04)
was littered and one of the complaints (45:02 - 45:06)
last year was why are the alolan (45:04 - 45:08)
starters here yep (45:06 - 45:10)
um they can't be shining yeah it was (45:08 - 45:11)
their evolutions (45:10 - 45:16)
yeah it was like and dartrix uh brione (45:11 - 45:19)
and uh tour cat were in raids for (45:16 - 45:22)
whatever reason and then Litton popplio (45:19 - 45:24)
and Rowlett were spawning and then the (45:22 - 45:27)
second day we went to the zoo and the (45:24 - 45:30)
only Pokemon spawning the second day was (45:27 - 45:32)
Nile ego yeah because it was the start (45:30 - 45:35)
of the ultra beast quest line but (45:32 - 45:37)
that was it like (45:35 - 45:41)
mega Rayquaza is a more exciting Pokemon (45:37 - 45:43)
by far like (45:41 - 45:46)
if Mewtwo is the most popular legendary (45:43 - 45:50)
which it is like people love Mewtwo (45:46 - 45:52)
Kanto strikes again (45:50 - 45:54)
um like Rayquaza is probably the second (45:52 - 46:00)
like and I'm so happy for Owen yeah (45:54 - 46:00)
um and the fact that you needed to do (46:00 - 46:04)
multiples to get mega and people love (46:02 - 46:06)
the shiny and then people want the shiny (46:04 - 46:08)
mega and you have the quest line to get (46:06 - 46:10)
the meteorite (46:08 - 46:12)
um like they know like Niantic knows (46:10 - 46:14)
Pokemon company knows that like they (46:12 - 46:15)
bring back Mewtwo ton of money like (46:14 - 46:17)
Shadow Mewtwo did super super well (46:15 - 46:19)
Shadow Articuno was like kind of a dud (46:17 - 46:21)
except for that first week (46:19 - 46:24)
um and (46:21 - 46:27)
Mega rayquazes were were filling (46:24 - 46:30)
and I I had to literally go invisible in (46:27 - 46:33)
Pokemon go I had the first time ever I (46:30 - 46:35)
went from off the little toggle of like (46:33 - 46:36)
if you're online I had to turn it off (46:35 - 46:39)
because people kept sending I I I'm (46:36 - 46:41)
sorry I'm not gonna pay two dollars to (46:39 - 46:44)
join your Rayquaza raid with nine people (46:41 - 46:47)
when I could do it for a dollar in (46:44 - 46:48)
person and have it instantly fill the (46:47 - 46:50)
20. I know I have the privilege of being (46:48 - 46:51)
at Mall of America but there's not a (46:50 - 46:53)
single Rayquaza that Greg and I didn't (46:51 - 46:56)
join that didn't insta-filled to 20. (46:53 - 46:58)
yeah I tried to invite people are like (46:56 - 46:59)
hey could you get me in and I would (46:58 - 47:01)
deliberately wait for it to reset to one (46:59 - 47:03)
person I would hit it I would send the (47:01 - 47:06)
invite I would get out and then it'd be (47:03 - 47:08)
like everybody's ready and the raid's (47:06 - 47:09)
full and I'm like well I hope you (47:08 - 47:10)
clicked it because you literally (47:09 - 47:12)
apparently had two seconds to receive it (47:10 - 47:14)
and click it to get in (47:12 - 47:17)
it is (47:14 - 47:20)
it is a wild experience at Mall of (47:17 - 47:22)
America try like (47:20 - 47:24)
I try to warn people like we're going to (47:22 - 47:26)
the mall the chances I'm going to get (47:24 - 47:29)
you into a remote raid are pretty slim (47:26 - 47:32)
I'm gonna try you go private and then (47:29 - 47:35)
flip it over but even like even when I (47:32 - 47:36)
did that and I was like okay we're at (47:35 - 47:38)
like 60 seconds I'm gonna open it up (47:36 - 47:40)
yeah like as soon as I opened it up it (47:38 - 47:42)
was like 10 seconds left like we're (47:40 - 47:44)
starting and yeah we're starting that's (47:42 - 47:45)
how most of the raids were in New York (47:44 - 47:49)
but that's kind of normal for New York (47:45 - 47:49)
um you the only other go Fest that I (47:50 - 47:54)
think (47:52 - 47:58)
it maybe came close to this like I I (47:54 - 48:00)
think for both days this was an awesome (47:58 - 48:03)
go Fest probably the best the only one (48:00 - 48:07)
that I can remember Global go Fest (48:03 - 48:09)
um the only the only one I can remember (48:07 - 48:13)
I think was two years ago and it was it (48:09 - 48:14)
was the second day where they were like (48:13 - 48:18)
all the Legends are in raids like that (48:14 - 48:20)
was a pretty awesome go for I don't even (48:18 - 48:22)
remember the first day though so the (48:20 - 48:23)
first day probably was kind of bad but (48:22 - 48:25)
the second day when they were like all (48:23 - 48:27)
the Legends are in raids like I remember (48:25 - 48:31)
that one really being awesome (48:27 - 48:33)
um as well but I think both days (48:31 - 48:34)
combined (48:33 - 48:37)
I think this was a really good go Fest (48:34 - 48:40)
uh and I think (48:37 - 48:40)
I think Greg is is is right in the (48:41 - 48:44)
instance (48:43 - 48:46)
sorry I'm backtracking a little bit of (48:44 - 48:49)
like the park not being this overcrowded (48:46 - 48:51)
experience and everyone's (48:49 - 48:52)
um situations are going to vary (48:51 - 48:54)
obviously but (48:52 - 48:57)
because the park is because the well (48:54 - 48:58)
because the first day is an eight-hour (48:57 - 49:00)
experience but it's two four hour (48:58 - 49:03)
experiences repeating it almost kind of (49:00 - 49:05)
reminded me of when communities were six (49:03 - 49:08)
hours because we've had so many years of (49:05 - 49:10)
communities being three hours and then (49:08 - 49:12)
they went to six and then they went back (49:10 - 49:14)
to three and what I noticed personally (49:12 - 49:16)
and this is me not I'm not defending (49:14 - 49:17)
Niantic in any way I'm just I'm just (49:16 - 49:19)
drawing a comparison (49:17 - 49:21)
in the six hours it never felt like (49:19 - 49:23)
there was enough people to do everything (49:21 - 49:26)
and it did feel like I needed to lure it (49:23 - 49:29)
up because people would not spend all (49:26 - 49:31)
six hours there which is like totally (49:29 - 49:32)
fine like some people just want to get (49:31 - 49:34)
three shinies they want to go some (49:32 - 49:35)
people are good with just three hours of (49:34 - 49:38)
go doing it and go but like (49:35 - 49:41)
the eight hours did kind of remind me of (49:38 - 49:44)
those longer communities where like (49:41 - 49:47)
because it's not concentrated (49:44 - 49:49)
there's there's more holes in the day (49:47 - 49:51)
where now that we're back to three hours (49:49 - 49:53)
it's like well we only have three hours (49:51 - 49:56)
so you're pushing everyone together (49:53 - 49:59)
which ultimately I think is (49:56 - 50:01)
niantic's goal right you push all the (49:59 - 50:04)
people together to force a community (50:01 - 50:05)
um (50:04 - 50:08)
because it forces a community that still (50:05 - 50:11)
doesn't really interact with each other (50:08 - 50:13)
like we're just there and you're looking (50:11 - 50:15)
to see is this lured up yes or no do I (50:13 - 50:17)
have to do this and it's it's such a (50:15 - 50:19)
weird it's such a weird commentary to be (50:17 - 50:22)
like well I had to lure all these up to (50:19 - 50:24)
get the most out of my experiences (50:22 - 50:26)
because there weren't other people doing (50:24 - 50:29)
that work for me is a really weird way (50:26 - 50:31)
to look at a community (50:29 - 50:34)
yeah sometimes the community part works (50:31 - 50:37)
and sometimes it doesn't and (50:34 - 50:39)
to be fair there's a lot of stops in (50:37 - 50:42)
Centennial right like and one of the (50:39 - 50:44)
things that I think at go Fest is it (50:42 - 50:47)
brings out people that that don't play a (50:44 - 50:49)
lot so when you have a spreaded (50:47 - 50:50)
experience and you have people who don't (50:49 - 50:54)
have a ton of lures to do it there are (50:50 - 50:56)
going to be natural holes unlike (50:54 - 50:59)
Community Day where yeah you get all the (50:56 - 51:03)
all of the die hards at the same time (50:59 - 51:04)
doing (51:03 - 51:06)
knowing how to set everything up like (51:04 - 51:08)
these are the people that are out here (51:06 - 51:09)
to get the most out of that time frame (51:08 - 51:11)
and of course they're going to lure (51:09 - 51:13)
things up but also they have the lures (51:11 - 51:15)
to do that with and I think that's a (51:13 - 51:18)
it's a weird thing that happens on these (51:15 - 51:21)
much larger larger events where you're (51:18 - 51:24)
getting a lot of people who can because (51:21 - 51:27)
they have a flexible schedule get out to (51:24 - 51:30)
do it when it fits their schedule (51:27 - 51:34)
but they aren't as set up as people who (51:30 - 51:36)
are into it more hardcore and you do (51:34 - 51:39)
kind of feel that if you're sort of (51:36 - 51:41)
looking at how do all the stops look (51:39 - 51:45)
what's the spawn rates looking like (51:41 - 51:47)
um the lows also lasts the full three (51:45 - 51:50)
hours on Community Day yeah these I (51:47 - 51:52)
think these I think only lasted one hour (51:50 - 51:53)
yeah (51:52 - 51:56)
and which was just a money grab from (51:53 - 51:59)
honestly I think it's also interesting (51:56 - 52:01)
to think that last year's go Fest (51:59 - 52:03)
Pikachu (52:01 - 52:07)
wore the same outfit every yes yeah this (52:03 - 52:09)
was the first time they did and this one (52:07 - 52:11)
is different and I think that helped (52:09 - 52:13)
make (52:11 - 52:16)
the event feel more unique in each hour (52:13 - 52:19)
because I'm looking at the at the amount (52:16 - 52:22)
of Pokemon that changed in each section (52:19 - 52:23)
last year and it's like this is pretty (52:22 - 52:25)
much the same amount and whether or not (52:23 - 52:27)
you liked them or didn't like them (52:25 - 52:29)
I think is the fact that there was a (52:27 - 52:34)
constant through of just one the Pikachu (52:29 - 52:36)
was always the same (52:34 - 52:40)
sort of helped blend them in and I think (52:36 - 52:45)
they were really tied weirdly to (52:40 - 52:48)
the theme of the things that spawns (52:45 - 52:50)
match the ultra Beasts for that hour (52:48 - 52:52)
which I think really limited their (52:50 - 52:55)
choices whereas I think this year felt (52:52 - 52:56)
like (52:55 - 53:00)
they picked a more broad theme to make (52:56 - 53:02)
the choices of things that appeared feel (53:00 - 53:05)
more varied so instead of like fermosa (53:02 - 53:07)
hour and you're like I'm sick of seeing (53:05 - 53:08)
bugs (53:07 - 53:12)
like I'm tired of I'm tired of bugs this (53:08 - 53:14)
sort of had a this had a different feel (53:12 - 53:16)
because it it had they had a much (53:14 - 53:19)
broader theme of what appeared and I (53:16 - 53:21)
think that just helped make it feel a (53:19 - 53:23)
little bit better even though like if (53:21 - 53:25)
you look at pure numbers they're pretty (53:23 - 53:30)
identical they just made it feel better (53:25 - 53:30)
I I think the (53:33 - 53:39)
I I'd be curious (53:35 - 53:39)
how people go about planning these (53:39 - 53:44)
events because I think that really does (53:43 - 53:47)
make or break their their overall (53:44 - 53:50)
experience so like when when Greg and I (53:47 - 53:51)
were talking of where we were going to (53:50 - 53:53)
play (53:51 - 53:56)
um obviously mall America is like (53:53 - 53:58)
well if we don't want to think too hard (53:56 - 54:00)
and we want the best spawn density and (53:58 - 54:02)
we want all of this we'll just go to (54:00 - 54:04)
ball America but there's there's also (54:02 - 54:05)
the like (54:04 - 54:08)
well it's only gonna be nice out for a (54:05 - 54:09)
couple more months so maybe we should go (54:08 - 54:11)
outside (54:09 - 54:13)
um (54:11 - 54:16)
but like we we've done (54:13 - 54:19)
we've done Community Days and we've done (54:16 - 54:21)
these bigger events at various places (54:19 - 54:26)
throughout Minneapolis or St Paul and I (54:21 - 54:28)
think we were talking about Downtown (54:26 - 54:30)
Minneapolis at one point and we did (54:28 - 54:32)
recently do a Community Day Downtown (54:30 - 54:33)
Minneapolis (54:32 - 54:36)
and even though the spawn density is (54:33 - 54:38)
really good there and there's plenty of (54:36 - 54:39)
places to go there's plenty of (54:38 - 54:41)
restaurants it's beautiful down there (54:39 - 54:43)
Great Park gold medal (54:41 - 54:44)
um (54:43 - 54:46)
we did Community down there and nothing (54:44 - 54:49)
was lured up we didn't see really anyone (54:46 - 54:50)
playing (54:49 - 54:51)
and (54:50 - 54:56)
would we go down there for a go Fest and (54:51 - 55:00)
have a good time yeah sure but like (54:56 - 55:02)
we just knew that players probably (55:00 - 55:05)
wouldn't be there where they would be at (55:02 - 55:07)
Centennial or some or the Art Park or (55:05 - 55:11)
Mall of America right so I do wonder if (55:07 - 55:14)
players think that out of like where is (55:11 - 55:15)
the best place I can go to play where (55:14 - 55:18)
are the people going to go where they (55:15 - 55:20)
don't I have to pay for parking because (55:18 - 55:22)
you have to pay for parking downtown (55:20 - 55:26)
yeah and we we also went to those two (55:22 - 55:30)
Lakes for the Squirtle classic Community (55:26 - 55:34)
right oh yeah we did uh we did the link (55:30 - 55:36)
of the Isles chains Lake of the Isles we (55:34 - 55:39)
did that for classic same same thing (55:36 - 55:42)
um like beautiful park it was a little (55:39 - 55:44)
hot you know great views of the lake (55:42 - 55:47)
tons of people out running kayaking (55:44 - 55:50)
boating picnics somebody doing a bar (55:47 - 55:53)
mitzvah like but things weren't lured up (55:50 - 55:55)
didn't seem like anyone was really like (55:53 - 55:57)
you know you saw a couple people playing (55:55 - 56:00)
but it didn't really feel (55:57 - 56:02)
like a bunch of zombies walking in (56:00 - 56:04)
circles Playing For Better or For Worse (56:02 - 56:06)
but like that is like the Pokemon go (56:04 - 56:07)
Community it's just everyone's staring (56:06 - 56:10)
at their phone walking in circles like (56:07 - 56:11)
you didn't feel that like you did at a (56:10 - 56:13)
park so (56:11 - 56:14)
um I know Niantic is trying to do that (56:13 - 56:17)
with um like the community ambassador (56:14 - 56:19)
program and we were talking about it in (56:17 - 56:23)
slack of like you can go to (56:19 - 56:25)
Pokemon golive.com community and then (56:23 - 56:27)
type in your zip code and there was one (56:25 - 56:29)
in (56:27 - 56:31)
Minneapolis and Greg and I talked about (56:29 - 56:34)
that too and it's like (56:31 - 56:34)
I know they're there I know the (56:35 - 56:39)
Ambassador is there but I've also played (56:36 - 56:43)
go at that Park and it's a giant loop (56:39 - 56:45)
around a lake and I'm just thinking in (56:43 - 56:48)
in a like structure if a raid pops on (56:45 - 56:50)
the other side of the lake it's gonna (56:48 - 56:53)
take me 25 minutes to walk I have to (56:50 - 56:55)
walk around the lake like (56:53 - 56:57)
unless I'm gonna rent a kayak and just (56:55 - 56:59)
try to cut through it I ain't gonna get (56:57 - 57:01)
there in time so like why would I go (56:59 - 57:04)
there when there are better more (57:01 - 57:06)
condensed parks that I know have that (57:04 - 57:09)
that Pokemon density that stop density (57:06 - 57:11)
that (57:09 - 57:13)
um and again like not every city not (57:11 - 57:17)
every town has a park like this but when (57:13 - 57:18)
I'm thinking of going to these bigger (57:17 - 57:21)
events I do actively think of like (57:18 - 57:24)
what's the almost like the best bang for (57:21 - 57:27)
my buck but in in pokestop and gym ratio (57:24 - 57:28)
yeah like (57:27 - 57:31)
comis and Centennial Lakes like lake (57:28 - 57:34)
comis is bigger (57:31 - 57:36)
um but not not like a ton bigger right (57:34 - 57:38)
like really if you're gonna walk around (57:36 - 57:41)
both Lake nicomas isn't going to take (57:38 - 57:43)
you a lot more the thing is is that (57:41 - 57:46)
Centennial Lakes was (57:43 - 57:46)
um a man-made (57:47 - 57:53)
designed lake so because of that and (57:49 - 57:55)
because there's businesses there are (57:53 - 57:58)
bridges constantly across that so if you (57:55 - 58:01)
see something you don't have to go (57:58 - 58:03)
around the loop of the lake you can cut (58:01 - 58:05)
across a bridge it just (58:03 - 58:09)
makes it easier to (58:05 - 58:14)
do a game in a park that's either (58:09 - 58:16)
smaller like Silver Lake which is the (58:14 - 58:19)
Art Park or that's designed with (58:16 - 58:23)
pedestrian Crossing in mind whereas Lake (58:19 - 58:26)
nakumbes all of the city Lakes they are (58:23 - 58:29)
natural lakes and they are huge Lakes so (58:26 - 58:33)
you can't just Dart they aren't made (58:29 - 58:35)
necessarily for (58:33 - 58:38)
any other activity other than being on (58:35 - 58:41)
the lake or walking or biking around the (58:38 - 58:43)
lake like that's what they're there for (58:41 - 58:46)
and when you're looking at a Pokemon go (58:43 - 58:49)
situation where your needs are different (58:46 - 58:51)
I don't deny that like Nokomis is (58:49 - 58:54)
beautiful and it's full of people but it (58:51 - 58:58)
is a big giant Loop parking is still bad (58:54 - 59:02)
there isn't a great (58:58 - 59:05)
there isn't support for how people play (59:02 - 59:07)
these games there aren't a lot of (59:05 - 59:08)
bathrooms there aren't like if you're (59:07 - 59:10)
hungry you do have to completely leave (59:08 - 59:14)
or go to the one Cabana place or they're (59:10 - 59:16)
one restaurant by the beach or there (59:14 - 59:18)
might be some carts out but also like if (59:16 - 59:21)
you're thirsty you have to like okay (59:18 - 59:24)
well we'll get back around to where the (59:21 - 59:27)
food is in half an hour it's just if I'm (59:24 - 59:31)
going to spend eight hours out there (59:27 - 59:34)
that's not my first thought yeah wait (59:31 - 59:36)
it's a longer event you really have to (59:34 - 59:38)
plan yeah it's like (59:36 - 59:41)
I don't and also like will wanted to (59:38 - 59:43)
leave and go take a nap which valid one (59:41 - 59:45)
thousand percent and the cars are right (59:43 - 59:47)
there I could just leave stuff in my car (59:45 - 59:49)
and be like I will go get it when I need (59:47 - 59:51)
it I don't have to carry it on me (59:49 - 59:53)
because (59:51 - 59:55)
the parking's right there it's like (59:53 - 59:57)
there are five different parts like pick (59:55 - 59:59)
an end there's a parking lot there for (59:57 - 60:04)
you to be in and for a long planned day (59:59 - 60:06)
it just makes more sense did it like (60:04 - 60:10)
would I do a community day at Nokomis (60:06 - 60:13)
sure I could happily go walk around that (60:10 - 60:15)
because a community day has different (60:13 - 60:18)
needs I don't need to complete something (60:15 - 60:22)
yeah the seven years of not making every (60:18 - 60:24)
gym have a raid and like that doesn't (60:22 - 60:26)
exist in community day like I still (60:24 - 60:27)
don't understand why niantic's not doing (60:26 - 60:30)
that just crank that raid slider during (60:27 - 60:32)
Community night and take it's free money (60:30 - 60:34)
yeah and like it's it's interesting (60:32 - 60:37)
because also you can tell there are big (60:34 - 60:40)
communities that do these areas like (60:37 - 60:42)
there I recognize whenever I go to the (60:40 - 60:44)
art Park and do Community Days there I (60:42 - 60:46)
recognize the people that do stuff at (60:44 - 60:48)
the airport I recognize people who are (60:46 - 60:50)
the Centennial Lakes Group I'm sure (60:48 - 60:52)
there are people that are the Nokomis (60:50 - 60:53)
group and that's where they're (60:52 - 60:55)
comfortable playing (60:53 - 60:56)
um (60:55 - 60:59)
it's not to say like these are bad spots (60:56 - 61:03)
they're not bad spots but (60:59 - 61:03)
each spot serves a particular thing (61:04 - 61:08)
better (61:07 - 61:11)
right like it is just if you want to do (61:08 - 61:13)
routes that are beautiful and be on a (61:11 - 61:16)
route that's probably pretty great go do (61:13 - 61:18)
downtown Minneapolis there are things to (61:16 - 61:20)
see and walk along (61:18 - 61:22)
a ton that's not just walking around the (61:20 - 61:24)
lake or as it was in Centennial Lakes (61:22 - 61:28)
the safe 17 people submitted the exact (61:24 - 61:30)
same Loop one that ended in the middle (61:28 - 61:32)
of the lake it was like (61:30 - 61:36)
how did you get disapproved (61:32 - 61:36)
so uh Hannah did you go anywhere (61:38 - 61:44)
specific for your day one I did not I (61:39 - 61:46)
got back from my New York trip and have (61:44 - 61:48)
been a little bit stressed with work (61:46 - 61:50)
stuff so I mostly just had the goal of (61:48 - 61:52)
completing all the collection challenges (61:50 - 61:54)
I live on a couple of pokestops and was (61:52 - 61:57)
also luring them up all day long but I (61:54 - 61:59)
know that people in the slack were (61:57 - 62:02)
really excited about this event and how (61:59 - 62:04)
many shinies there were even if you (62:02 - 62:06)
didn't have a ticket it seemed like yeah (62:04 - 62:08)
I uh I was gonna bring that up that this (62:06 - 62:11)
is like the first Global go Fest I felt (62:08 - 62:14)
like the free people were pretty like (62:11 - 62:15)
happy (62:14 - 62:18)
that like they were free and it seemed (62:15 - 62:20)
like that's usually not the case for a (62:18 - 62:23)
global go Fest it's usually like oh I'm (62:20 - 62:25)
free and Niantic screwed me over it's (62:23 - 62:27)
actually been getting worse but not this (62:25 - 62:29)
time (62:27 - 62:30)
yeah so um (62:29 - 62:32)
you know I think the pay ticket was (62:30 - 62:34)
worth it uh (62:32 - 62:36)
uh I I think you know if you wanted to (62:34 - 62:39)
collect unknowns that was part of the (62:36 - 62:42)
ticket you got eight you got nine raid (62:39 - 62:45)
passes for both days so and the (62:42 - 62:48)
increased catch rate for the legendaries (62:45 - 62:50)
was great (62:48 - 62:53)
yeah yeah let me complain real quick The (62:50 - 62:56)
increased legendaries fantastic that (62:53 - 63:02)
they did that uh why is fungus or moral (62:56 - 63:04)
like the two hardest Pokemon ever to (63:02 - 63:07)
catch like why why is morelo like red (63:04 - 63:10)
circle like you can't be shiny like yeah (63:07 - 63:12)
he gives a little bit of extra Stardust (63:10 - 63:13)
that's why I want to catch him that's (63:12 - 63:14)
why I'm like (63:13 - 63:17)
why why is why is more a little harder (63:14 - 63:19)
to catch than a Rayquaza I have no clue (63:17 - 63:24)
Manchester fomantis was so hard to catch (63:19 - 63:26)
I mean more lull is going to be harder (63:24 - 63:27)
for a lot of people because it's fairy (63:26 - 63:29)
type and most people don't have that (63:27 - 63:31)
Platinum badge yet oh I got I got the (63:29 - 63:34)
item believe that so don't you worry (63:31 - 63:37)
about that that's taken care of like I I (63:34 - 63:41)
caught probably 4 000 Pokemon over this (63:37 - 63:44)
weekend I I went pretty hard especially (63:41 - 63:46)
um the day today the day I wasn't (63:44 - 63:48)
streaming I went a lot harder because (63:46 - 63:50)
like when I'm streaming I'm I'm a little (63:48 - 63:51)
slower because I'm chit chatting and I'm (63:50 - 63:52)
like trying to answer people's questions (63:51 - 63:54)
I'm showing around I didn't catch a (63:52 - 63:57)
single Lapras I tapped laprases but if (63:54 - 63:58)
anyone has ever caught a Lapras (63:57 - 64:00)
listening to the show it is a nightmare (63:58 - 64:03)
situation because Lapras has whatever (64:00 - 64:05)
ridiculous catch rate in the entire (64:03 - 64:07)
world (64:05 - 64:08)
um (64:07 - 64:11)
I I was like no we're not dealing with (64:08 - 64:13)
you you are not purple so I am moving on (64:11 - 64:14)
I would like to catch more a little (64:13 - 64:17)
because I have my because it's the (64:14 - 64:19)
active double Stardust I got a star (64:17 - 64:20)
piece on definitely want to try to catch (64:19 - 64:23)
this moral we're like five Great Balls (64:20 - 64:25)
later you're still not staying in your (64:23 - 64:26)
Pokemon I'm not gonna golden Rez you (64:25 - 64:29)
Marlo like I got I got things to do (64:26 - 64:32)
didn't get frustrated enough I know I (64:29 - 64:33)
have golden rest (64:32 - 64:35)
I'm too frustrated with it popping out (64:33 - 64:37)
of the Pokeball too many times I would (64:35 - 64:38)
golden Razz but I feel like in the last (64:37 - 64:41)
six months Niantic is like slowly nerfed (64:38 - 64:43)
golden raspberries and I don't have as (64:41 - 64:45)
many as I used to (64:43 - 64:46)
um (64:45 - 64:48)
so yeah that's that was kind of like my (64:46 - 64:51)
first complaint is (64:48 - 64:52)
um (64:51 - 64:55)
some of the catch rates just seemed like (64:52 - 64:58)
ridiculously high for no apparent reason (64:55 - 65:01)
but they consciously thought about the (64:58 - 65:03)
legend stuff which was like a great (65:01 - 65:07)
change and I think that I I will get it (65:03 - 65:10)
on my soapbox again I don't want 22 (65:07 - 65:13)
pokeballs to catch a evatel and then if (65:10 - 65:14)
I'm hitting (65:13 - 65:17)
golden Razz great look I can't always (65:14 - 65:20)
get excellent on evatel I'm not (65:17 - 65:22)
maybe I'm not gonna sit there and like (65:20 - 65:24)
hold the circle to constantly get (65:22 - 65:26)
excellent but like (65:24 - 65:28)
after 22 (65:26 - 65:31)
razas and great throws the evatel runs (65:28 - 65:33)
away that is the worst feeling in the (65:31 - 65:35)
world not because I didn't catch it but (65:33 - 65:38)
because I just spent 12 minutes doing (65:35 - 65:42)
that like cut my balls in half like give (65:38 - 65:45)
me only 11 instead of 12 is a weird (65:42 - 65:48)
sentence give me only 11 instead of 22 (65:45 - 65:50)
and make the catch rate like a little (65:48 - 65:52)
bit better that way at least when it (65:50 - 65:54)
flees it's like okay well that was like (65:52 - 65:58)
three minutes not like 15 minutes I (65:54 - 65:59)
and we saw that this weekend with (65:58 - 66:02)
Rayquaza like it felt so good to catch (65:59 - 66:04)
it relatively quickly and I think every (66:02 - 66:07)
Rayquaza had like nine pokeballs yeah I (66:04 - 66:13)
I am officially over catch rates I I it (66:07 - 66:17)
is such a it is such a tired and not fun (66:13 - 66:20)
mechanic it's like the last bit of grind (66:17 - 66:22)
that they've just decided this is an (66:20 - 66:25)
appropriate grind and there is this (66:22 - 66:28)
weird thought process again that if it (66:25 - 66:30)
takes (66:28 - 66:34)
longer it feels like you've accomplished (66:30 - 66:37)
more and that is simply not true anymore (66:34 - 66:41)
it just took longer and if I didn't (66:37 - 66:44)
catch it I'm more angry because I wasted (66:41 - 66:48)
a lot of time and resources for no (66:44 - 66:49)
reason (66:48 - 66:52)
especially in a world of go where like (66:49 - 66:53)
today (66:52 - 66:56)
turn a corner there's a Rayquaza like it (66:53 - 66:58)
like (66:56 - 67:01)
catch rates just don't serve a good (66:58 - 67:03)
purpose anymore it's not even solving an (67:01 - 67:05)
in-game economy anymore because it's (67:03 - 67:07)
Pokeballs that you're giving me for free (67:05 - 67:08)
for spinning (67:07 - 67:11)
like it's just (67:08 - 67:14)
silly at this point get having a Pokemon (67:11 - 67:17)
breakout of an excellent throw (67:14 - 67:21)
like a mortal yeah is is the most (67:17 - 67:23)
infuriating it's a giant middle finger (67:21 - 67:26)
it's just a giant middle finger to you (67:23 - 67:28)
and your time to your children to your (67:26 - 67:30)
ancestors (67:28 - 67:33)
it's just it's just a giant (67:30 - 67:36)
take that you want this mushroom guess (67:33 - 67:38)
again (67:36 - 67:41)
uh maybe this is just me the other like (67:38 - 67:44)
minor complaint I have is like unknown (67:41 - 67:49)
don't feel as exciting anymore (67:44 - 67:50)
like (67:49 - 67:52)
again I think this is just a me problem (67:50 - 67:54)
because I go to the in-person go Fest so (67:52 - 67:56)
like unknown is there but like with the (67:54 - 68:00)
habitats the Sans and the Mac light ore (67:56 - 68:01)
and whatever the other two were called (68:00 - 68:03)
the grassy one and the other the pink (68:01 - 68:06)
one the pink one green blue and yellow (68:03 - 68:07)
ones (68:06 - 68:09)
um the unknown was the most unexciting (68:07 - 68:11)
part like when the Bisharp showed up (68:09 - 68:15)
which was incense or when the (68:11 - 68:16)
um (68:15 - 68:18)
the Gumi was like on incense for like (68:16 - 68:20)
the pink one or whatever the blue one I (68:18 - 68:22)
think like those were significantly more (68:20 - 68:25)
exciting to me than the unknown (68:22 - 68:27)
uh and maybe because like like (68:25 - 68:29)
they like (68:27 - 68:32)
didn't have boosted odds for unknown or (68:29 - 68:35)
whatever but like I don't I don't know I (68:32 - 68:37)
had a certain point I was like I'm not (68:35 - 68:40)
not a not a Pawnee or okay cool like I (68:37 - 68:43)
have been catching unknown at a number (68:40 - 68:46)
of fests at this point where I'm just (68:43 - 68:48)
like yeah but I've seen a lot of these (68:46 - 68:50)
yeah yeah so I think I think probably (68:48 - 68:52)
for (68:50 - 68:54)
other people who are newer or who (68:52 - 68:56)
haven't gone to as many in-person events (68:54 - 68:58)
uh known are still pretty exciting but (68:56 - 69:01)
also when it's tied to incense like that (68:58 - 69:03)
it gets a little bit mundane I think (69:01 - 69:06)
even then greater than the Pikachu off (69:03 - 69:08)
the incense though was (69:06 - 69:09)
awesome (69:08 - 69:12)
like I think last year it was unknown (69:09 - 69:14)
and then Pikachu was on the incense so (69:12 - 69:15)
it was frustrating to be like I don't (69:14 - 69:17)
want the letters anymore I just want (69:15 - 69:19)
Pikachu and I was like I'm only seeing (69:17 - 69:20)
like two or three Pikachus an hour (69:19 - 69:23)
because I keep getting like D's thrown (69:20 - 69:24)
in my face I don't know what the word (69:23 - 69:26)
was last year but there's a the word (69:24 - 69:30)
this year was Diamond I think (69:26 - 69:30)
yeah and maybe it was because I went to (69:31 - 69:35)
the in-person New York go Fest but I was (69:33 - 69:37)
not super impressed by the unknown this (69:35 - 69:40)
year so maybe it's just you've seen them (69:37 - 69:43)
once you've seen them all did uh New (69:40 - 69:46)
York have like the unknown on the hour (69:43 - 69:49)
it did theoretically (69:46 - 69:50)
I don't feel like it worked every time (69:49 - 69:53)
but it worked kind of a little bit (69:50 - 69:56)
sometimes (69:53 - 69:59)
I think that I think the like on the (69:56 - 70:01)
hour stuff and the in person is really (69:59 - 70:03)
good when it works the on the hour stuff (70:01 - 70:05)
is really exciting we would just (70:03 - 70:08)
sometimes have our phones open and (70:05 - 70:10)
everybody would say it's top of the hour (70:08 - 70:12)
and nothing maybe too unknown would show (70:10 - 70:14)
up and that kind of sucks (70:12 - 70:19)
yeah I I noticed this in Osaka where (70:14 - 70:20)
um (70:19 - 70:22)
so what they used to do is the spawns (70:20 - 70:26)
you saw would change into unknown hmm (70:22 - 70:28)
and that that's that that's what (70:26 - 70:30)
happened at Germany that's what happened (70:28 - 70:33)
um at like Seattle and stuff so what (70:30 - 70:35)
some people would do is they would like (70:33 - 70:37)
find a shiny and then they would run (70:35 - 70:39)
from it and then when the hour flipped (70:37 - 70:41)
over they would know that one that (70:39 - 70:43)
whatever unknown replace that Shiny (70:41 - 70:46)
Pokemon that unknown would be shiny (70:43 - 70:48)
um the other thing that would happen is (70:46 - 70:51)
like when when I was like at the Germany (70:48 - 70:53)
go fest last year if you caught all the (70:51 - 70:55)
Pokemon in that area (70:53 - 70:58)
and then the top of the hour hit (70:55 - 71:01)
there was nothing to turn into unknown (70:58 - 71:03)
so you you would once you figured this (71:01 - 71:05)
out and of course that was back in the (71:03 - 71:07)
day where you only had like a one (71:05 - 71:09)
experience right so (71:07 - 71:11)
um or one day (71:09 - 71:11)
um (71:11 - 71:13)
once you figure that out it's like too (71:11 - 71:16)
late this year I think they slightly (71:13 - 71:18)
changed it where if you keep moving new (71:16 - 71:21)
unknown would spawn in but they weren't (71:18 - 71:23)
replacing what was already there which (71:21 - 71:25)
is like both good or bad right yeah so (71:23 - 71:29)
like ultimately when the instead of (71:25 - 71:30)
standing still like you did last year (71:29 - 71:32)
you're supposed to like okay you got two (71:30 - 71:35)
minutes like go go go go go go go that (71:32 - 71:37)
definitely explains it because when (71:35 - 71:38)
everybody noticed it was the top of the (71:37 - 71:40)
hour we would all stand still and open (71:38 - 71:43)
our phones right yes so I I'm pretty (71:40 - 71:45)
sure they actively changed it (71:43 - 71:46)
um (71:45 - 71:49)
but I'm I'm I was distracted every time (71:46 - 71:50)
it was top of the hour in Osaka I was (71:49 - 71:53)
like trying to trade like an old lady (71:50 - 71:55)
like a Pikachu like this five minute (71:53 - 71:58)
trade (71:55 - 71:58)
other thing I would say not really a (71:59 - 72:04)
complaint just a side note (72:02 - 72:08)
I feel like the global go Fest no one (72:04 - 72:11)
trades like no one like like when I feel (72:08 - 72:13)
like when you travel to a New York or a (72:11 - 72:18)
Germany or a a Japan there are people (72:13 - 72:20)
who print out signs they they're like (72:18 - 72:23)
asking for trades there are people who (72:20 - 72:26)
like notice that you are not from this (72:23 - 72:28)
country like I stand out like a sore (72:26 - 72:31)
thumb in Korea or in Japan right like (72:28 - 72:33)
look at that white dude over there he (72:31 - 72:35)
must have boothalant it's true I do have (72:33 - 72:38)
Buffalo they're not wrong by any means (72:35 - 72:40)
um (72:38 - 72:44)
uh but like I don't they're not a single (72:40 - 72:46)
person stop me the two days in (72:44 - 72:49)
Minneapolis to be like would you like to (72:46 - 72:51)
trade (72:49 - 72:52)
when you're just in your local area (72:51 - 72:54)
that's a totally different thing than (72:52 - 72:56)
going to a whole place to get together (72:54 - 72:58)
with a bunch of trainers specifically (72:56 - 73:00)
for the event I mean we're there with (72:58 - 73:02)
locals and I think the general (73:00 - 73:03)
assumption is when you're there with (73:02 - 73:06)
locals what do you what they don't know (73:03 - 73:08)
they don't know where I've been Greg (73:06 - 73:09)
yeah they don't know that I have the (73:08 - 73:12)
Sensei oracorios yeah but you're not (73:09 - 73:15)
also going to think am I going to stop (73:12 - 73:17)
everybody to see if they've traveled out (73:15 - 73:21)
like in post pandemic (73:17 - 73:25)
no money Universe the Assumption isn't (73:21 - 73:28)
going to be that these people have (73:25 - 73:31)
traveled to all of these vast different (73:28 - 73:33)
countries and played Pokemon go there so (73:31 - 73:37)
I like I don't think it's unusual for (73:33 - 73:39)
people locally to not ask for trades (73:37 - 73:42)
because generally good they're going to (73:39 - 73:44)
think you probably have everything that (73:42 - 73:46)
I have because we're in the same area (73:44 - 73:49)
and we get the same spawns whereas when (73:46 - 73:52)
you're going to a different country or a (73:49 - 73:54)
specifically different place that is a (73:52 - 73:56)
destination people are going to assume (73:54 - 73:59)
that you came from somewhere like going (73:56 - 74:02)
to New York for an in-person go Fest (73:59 - 74:05)
people know people came from California (74:02 - 74:08)
or Florida or (74:05 - 74:12)
Puerto Rico or South America who came in (74:08 - 74:15)
for this event so yeah they're going to (74:12 - 74:17)
be more likely like hey (74:15 - 74:20)
there's a better chance you have (74:17 - 74:22)
something I don't have than when you're (74:20 - 74:25)
at yet another (74:22 - 74:27)
in-person event locally with the same (74:25 - 74:29)
people you've been seeing now for seven (74:27 - 74:30)
years (74:29 - 74:33)
if you're in a good local group you get (74:30 - 74:35)
people who offer after they've gone to a (74:33 - 74:37)
on a vacation and come back with some (74:35 - 74:39)
rare Pokemon but other than that yeah (74:37 - 74:41)
although I didn't really get people (74:39 - 74:43)
asking me for trades for the most part (74:41 - 74:45)
at New York City go Fest but I was also (74:43 - 74:46)
a little bit (74:45 - 74:48)
did they have a trading area (74:46 - 74:50)
they didn't (74:48 - 74:52)
at least as far as we could tell it was (74:50 - 74:54)
not on the map and usually it's not in (74:52 - 74:56)
the shade it's usually away from (74:54 - 74:58)
everything directly in the sun no chairs (74:56 - 75:01)
they want you to suffer no that was the (74:58 - 75:04)
battle area this time oh okay (75:01 - 75:06)
battle directly in the sun battle in the (75:04 - 75:09)
sun sitting on a wonderful hay bales (75:06 - 75:12)
that was the one in Chicago (75:09 - 75:13)
no they had this cute little battle area (75:12 - 75:16)
set up and the the line was actually in (75:13 - 75:18)
the shade so that was done well but I (75:16 - 75:19)
don't think there was a particular (75:18 - 75:21)
trading area at all when I went back the (75:19 - 75:23)
second day I went on Sunday morning with (75:21 - 75:27)
tone to try and find uh or to try and (75:23 - 75:30)
get into the merch tent (75:27 - 75:32)
um successfully thankfully we looked (75:30 - 75:34)
around for a trading area and I think (75:32 - 75:36)
there just wasn't a trading area in the (75:34 - 75:38)
park it was just sort of happening all (75:36 - 75:40)
over the place because when you came (75:38 - 75:42)
into the park they would hand you one of (75:40 - 75:43)
those little signs that says I'm looking (75:42 - 75:45)
for this Pokemon I have this Pokemon to (75:43 - 75:47)
trade (75:45 - 75:50)
yeah yeah yeah (75:47 - 75:50)
um I will say that you know I've (75:50 - 75:53)
complained (75:51 - 75:57)
on the show about Community Days (75:53 - 75:58)
um and just defense feeling like they're (75:57 - 76:00)
missing something (75:58 - 76:02)
um specifically you know Community when (76:00 - 76:03)
you're when you've done a community day (76:02 - 76:05)
for like six years (76:03 - 76:07)
kind of the same right you walk around (76:05 - 76:10)
circles you get a bunch of shinies you (76:07 - 76:12)
hope that raids pop (76:10 - 76:17)
raids don't pop rights don't pop (76:12 - 76:20)
um but I will say uh with this Global go (76:17 - 76:23)
Fest for the two days (76:20 - 76:26)
the color the not the collection I (76:23 - 76:28)
always like the collection challenge (76:26 - 76:30)
um the uh what's it called the where you (76:28 - 76:33)
put a Pokemon in the size thing contest (76:30 - 76:36)
showcase showcases the Showcase I think (76:33 - 76:40)
the Showcase is a great addition (76:36 - 76:42)
um and I believe it was on the it was (76:40 - 76:43)
definitely on the Squirtle Community Day (76:42 - 76:47)
Greg and I did three of them uh like (76:43 - 76:48)
that's where we learned they were they (76:47 - 76:50)
messed with us because we yeah (76:48 - 76:53)
yeah that was on a broke (76:50 - 76:56)
um I will say like at the park there was (76:53 - 76:58)
only one showcase (76:56 - 77:00)
and at the Mall of America there was (76:58 - 77:03)
also only one showcase (77:00 - 77:04)
um which was like a little bit of a (77:03 - 77:06)
bummer but uh and I'm sure it's that one (77:04 - 77:11)
showcase top out yeah okay oh the the (77:06 - 77:13)
the one at the park topped out within an (77:11 - 77:15)
hour or two (77:13 - 77:17)
um and then one at mall America topped (77:15 - 77:19)
out in like 10 minutes yeah the ones in (77:17 - 77:21)
New York were completely full the entire (77:19 - 77:23)
time (77:21 - 77:26)
uh and like it was it was cool and I I (77:23 - 77:28)
do (77:26 - 77:31)
think that it is a great addition to the (77:28 - 77:33)
game especially because it gives you a (77:31 - 77:35)
Target in mind so like for the one I'm (77:33 - 77:38)
all America's Pikachu and I I went in at (77:35 - 77:40)
number two felt really good halfway (77:38 - 77:42)
through the day I got bumped down to (77:40 - 77:44)
number three but it on my head in my (77:42 - 77:46)
head I'm like I'm catching every single (77:44 - 77:47)
Pikachu even though I already got the (77:46 - 77:49)
four shinies even though like I got the (77:47 - 77:52)
Pikachu metal like five years ago like (77:49 - 77:53)
I'm just gonna catch every single (77:52 - 77:54)
Pikachu because what if I what if a (77:53 - 77:56)
Pikachu is bigger and it's number one (77:54 - 77:59)
like that would be awesome and then in (77:56 - 78:03)
the day before the Showcase was for (77:59 - 78:04)
what Pokemon was that I think it was (78:03 - 78:10)
Goomy Gumi yeah so you I you know on (78:04 - 78:12)
this show I have said I'm not giving (78:10 - 78:15)
Gumi any money not falling for Niantic (78:12 - 78:18)
scam because Gumi Community Day will (78:15 - 78:21)
happen I'm sure June of next year right (78:18 - 78:24)
uh I got my shiny Gumi just from the (78:21 - 78:26)
research for the record I got it from (78:24 - 78:30)
the research so I got my shiny Goomy in (78:26 - 78:33)
the wild for free that was our chant (78:30 - 78:35)
whenever whenever I found one in the (78:33 - 78:37)
wild I would scream free Gooby because (78:35 - 78:40)
certain members of our party were paying (78:37 - 78:44)
a dollar to go to Gumi raids where I was (78:40 - 78:47)
getting mine for free there were two (78:44 - 78:50)
people with us that gave Niantic at (78:47 - 78:51)
least (78:50 - 78:54)
thirty dollars each for Gumi they did (78:51 - 78:57)
every Goomy they said oh look at Mall of (78:54 - 78:59)
America goomies were fill into 20 (78:57 - 79:02)
instantly every single time it was the (78:59 - 79:04)
biggest scam in the entire world because (79:02 - 79:06)
again (79:04 - 79:06)
oh Goomy Community is coming I I didn't (79:07 - 79:15)
do us I did one Goomy raid and it was (79:11 - 79:19)
only because I was sitting on my butt I (79:15 - 79:23)
was super tired and I I had my my free (79:19 - 79:25)
raid pass or whatever that was the only (79:23 - 79:26)
one I did (79:25 - 79:28)
um but my shiny Gumi I got from the (79:26 - 79:30)
little research and then I caught every (79:28 - 79:32)
Goomy during whatever I think it was (79:30 - 79:35)
like the blue hour goomies appeared (79:32 - 79:38)
um but again for the the Showcase I was (79:35 - 79:41)
like number 63 in the Showcase and I was (79:38 - 79:43)
like hopefully by the end of the six (79:41 - 79:46)
hours I can go up though and I made it (79:43 - 79:48)
up to 32 because I was just I kept (79:46 - 79:50)
catching more goomies and like (79:48 - 79:53)
I think it's great I think showcases are (79:50 - 79:55)
so cool I just kind of wish there was (79:53 - 79:58)
it's it's cool once you get into it (79:55 - 80:01)
but if you don't get into that showcase (79:58 - 80:05)
you feel like (80:01 - 80:07)
you feel like everyone is in like this (80:05 - 80:09)
club that you didn't get invited to it (80:07 - 80:11)
sucks it sucks like that was me in Japan (80:09 - 80:13)
I was like I never got into a Showcase (80:11 - 80:15)
in Japan and I was so salty the entire (80:13 - 80:18)
time I was so mad Japanese people are (80:15 - 80:20)
way too fast they're on top of it (80:18 - 80:22)
they're like scouting it out like there (80:20 - 80:25)
was a showcase outside of my hotel for (80:22 - 80:28)
worlds and I'm like okay cool the (80:25 - 80:30)
Showcase starts at like 10. I like got (80:28 - 80:32)
out of the shower it's like 1004 (80:30 - 80:36)
completely filled 150 people within four (80:32 - 80:38)
minutes filled it wasn't even near the (80:36 - 80:40)
convention center it wasn't the opposite (80:38 - 80:43)
side like they just failed it instantly (80:40 - 80:47)
and then I had to suffer the next eight (80:43 - 80:48)
hours knowing that whatever this (80:47 - 80:50)
showcase was bell sprout or something (80:48 - 80:53)
outside of my hotel was like yep I wish (80:50 - 80:56)
I was in there can't because I'd be (80:53 - 80:58)
catching whatever Pokemon it is all day (80:56 - 81:00)
to make sure I could get number one like (80:58 - 81:02)
showcases are so cool but like the the (81:00 - 81:05)
limit is like I understand the limit (81:02 - 81:07)
if you don't live in a big city I'm sure (81:05 - 81:10)
it's great oh It's gotta be great it's (81:07 - 81:12)
kind of travel 50 miles for this (81:10 - 81:14)
showcase (81:12 - 81:17)
she like in Appleton Wisconsin there's (81:14 - 81:19)
like four people in the Showcase and (81:17 - 81:22)
you're like this is great easy for me to (81:19 - 81:25)
get to number one (81:22 - 81:25)
anyways uh Niantic should do more of (81:26 - 81:31)
that stuff because we can't rely on (81:30 - 81:33)
raids forever the Showcase stuff is I (81:31 - 81:35)
don't know maybe maybe somebody's (81:33 - 81:36)
listening like I hate showcases I think (81:35 - 81:38)
they're awesome I think they're really (81:36 - 81:39)
cool I just think there need to be more (81:38 - 81:41)
of them I still don't see them (81:39 - 81:44)
frequently enough (81:41 - 81:44)
yeah yeah yeah (81:45 - 81:48)
and you could only be in three showcases (81:47 - 81:51)
so even if like (81:48 - 81:53)
there was like six at a park (81:51 - 81:56)
like that would should give more up more (81:53 - 82:00)
opportunities to people to be in them (81:56 - 82:01)
um ideally (82:00 - 82:03)
I don't know how showcases are (82:01 - 82:04)
determined (82:03 - 82:06)
um I guess the last thing (82:04 - 82:09)
would be routes again we talk about how (82:06 - 82:11)
Community days have been the same and (82:09 - 82:12)
how like some of these events have been (82:11 - 82:14)
the same but I guess this is the first (82:12 - 82:16)
Global go fast that was (82:14 - 82:20)
collection challenge uh incense thing (82:16 - 82:26)
raids uh rotating habitats showcases and (82:20 - 82:28)
routes (82:26 - 82:30)
routes are still kind of bad rather bad (82:28 - 82:34)
still very broken they're not bad I I (82:30 - 82:37)
think they it I think it's a good idea I (82:34 - 82:41)
like the idea but they're not paperwork (82:37 - 82:46)
good in execution maybe having maybe (82:41 - 82:48)
having a person (82:46 - 82:50)
walk around the park (82:48 - 82:53)
and then end that route in the middle of (82:50 - 82:57)
the lake where I watched Greg and two (82:53 - 83:00)
other people walk onto a (82:57 - 83:04)
deck walk out on the dock the doc was (83:00 - 83:06)
safe and uh no I thought one of you guys (83:04 - 83:08)
were gonna fall in that doc was super (83:06 - 83:12)
shaky that's what docs are yeah (83:08 - 83:15)
good dogs aren't they key (83:12 - 83:18)
it was shaky and there was no handles (83:15 - 83:20)
there were like little poles coming out (83:18 - 83:23)
of the ground that Greg grabbed onto but (83:20 - 83:25)
there was like no handles I thought Greg (83:23 - 83:27)
was going in no I have lived on a lake (83:25 - 83:30)
my entire life I'm not falling off a (83:27 - 83:32)
dock there was one person in our party (83:30 - 83:34)
that was like they canceled the route (83:32 - 83:35)
they were like I'm not walking on the (83:34 - 83:40)
dock they they they are (83:35 - 83:42)
so there are two types of docs there are (83:40 - 83:44)
the more permanent wood ones that take a (83:42 - 83:46)
lot of (83:44 - 83:48)
time and they have to put in (83:46 - 83:51)
and they aren't particularly movable so (83:48 - 83:53)
if anything goes wrong you're kind of (83:51 - 83:54)
stuck in that position (83:53 - 83:58)
at Centennial Lakes they have wooden (83:54 - 84:01)
planks like that go out and then they (83:58 - 84:02)
attach (84:01 - 84:06)
floating docks so they are anxious in (84:02 - 84:07)
the ground they are big giant plastic (84:06 - 84:09)
cubes they are completely safe they are (84:07 - 84:12)
anchored and they aren't going anywhere (84:09 - 84:17)
but they do move a little bit because (84:12 - 84:19)
they are Giant floating crates that can (84:17 - 84:21)
be moved to meet their needs but they (84:19 - 84:23)
are recklessly seconds of going (84:21 - 84:27)
overboard I was nowhere near close to (84:23 - 84:30)
going overboard I was like Greg it's not (84:27 - 84:33)
worth it for the Zygarde so don't do it (84:30 - 84:36)
yeah that's the thing I've never seen (84:33 - 84:38)
nobody gotta I've never I'm like you (84:36 - 84:39)
know what (84:38 - 84:43)
forget this like at least I I risked (84:39 - 84:46)
life and limb going on a death dock (84:43 - 84:49)
for no good reason (84:46 - 84:53)
it comes towards a metal there are six (84:49 - 84:56)
routes at Mall of America they're all (84:53 - 84:59)
just circles they all start at random (84:56 - 85:03)
places prices and end in a circle it's (84:59 - 85:04)
so dumb (85:03 - 85:07)
like (85:04 - 85:07)
like the routes are so good on like (85:07 - 85:12)
there should only be like one route up (85:10 - 85:15)
all America it should be like start at (85:12 - 85:18)
this point do the route and like the (85:15 - 85:20)
mall America is just a giant circle with (85:18 - 85:22)
a huge amusement park in the middle you (85:20 - 85:23)
can't really get that creative with a (85:22 - 85:25)
route like I would I would think it (85:23 - 85:27)
would be interesting if they did a route (85:25 - 85:30)
through the amusement park and hitting (85:27 - 85:32)
like here's where you find swiper and (85:30 - 85:34)
here's where you find these but routes (85:32 - 85:36)
aren't that complicated you can't set (85:34 - 85:38)
points of interest you can only do start (85:36 - 85:39)
to finish (85:38 - 85:43)
and also it I'm still don't know which (85:39 - 85:45)
is the start flag color and which is the (85:43 - 85:47)
stop flag color because it doesn't tell (85:45 - 85:49)
you and it asks you do you want to (85:47 - 85:51)
reverse it and I'm I don't know because (85:49 - 85:53)
I don't know where the actual start is (85:51 - 85:56)
surely the start can't be in the middle (85:53 - 85:58)
of the lake so I'm assuming that's the (85:56 - 86:01)
end which is also a problem (85:58 - 86:04)
but like the one we did that we tried to (86:01 - 86:07)
do at uh Stone Arch (86:04 - 86:09)
it's like we'll go to the start but (86:07 - 86:11)
you're not telling me which flag is the (86:09 - 86:15)
start like you're not telling me (86:11 - 86:17)
which and you're just saying or do you (86:15 - 86:19)
want to reverse throughout like well I (86:17 - 86:20)
don't know because I don't know what the (86:19 - 86:22)
third is they've added some arrows (86:20 - 86:24)
before you start that yeah the arrows (86:22 - 86:26)
are the arrows help they're always help (86:24 - 86:29)
a little bit I submitted a route after I (86:26 - 86:30)
complained about my first two submitted (86:29 - 86:35)
ones uh not working within two hours (86:30 - 86:35)
if you've gotten approved yeah the (86:36 - 86:40)
errors up if you can find the start (86:38 - 86:43)
because the arrows only extend from the (86:40 - 86:45)
start so far so if you're in the middle (86:43 - 86:47)
of the route and you're looking (86:45 - 86:49)
and you're like (86:47 - 86:52)
okay I'm in the blank area I still don't (86:49 - 86:55)
know which flag I need to to go to to (86:52 - 86:57)
see the arrows and I have to accept the (86:55 - 86:59)
route to see the arrows because your (86:57 - 87:02)
preview doesn't tell me (86:59 - 87:06)
so what am I supposed to do here I am I (87:02 - 87:09)
have no Insider info (87:06 - 87:13)
um but I would assume that the Wayfair (87:09 - 87:15)
program will probably eventually extend (87:13 - 87:19)
to routes and have like a review process (87:15 - 87:22)
because like you can rate a route like I (87:19 - 87:24)
did the Mall of America one and it was a (87:22 - 87:26)
circle (87:24 - 87:29)
and it wasn't even a complete circle it (87:26 - 87:31)
was like 80 percent the circle like just (87:29 - 87:32)
finished the circle it's small America (87:31 - 87:34)
like you start at this entrance just (87:32 - 87:36)
walk all the way around and then stop at (87:34 - 87:38)
the entrance like that would make the (87:36 - 87:39)
most sense (87:38 - 87:42)
um but there were six of them (87:39 - 87:44)
and they they were all just sloppily (87:42 - 87:47)
made like they were like the titles were (87:44 - 87:50)
really bad really vague they (87:47 - 87:52)
weren't (87:50 - 87:54)
the same thing at Centennial likes like (87:52 - 87:56)
you popped it up and there was like (87:54 - 87:57)
eight and people are probably listening (87:56 - 87:58)
to be like you got eight routes at like (87:57 - 88:00)
we got none here (87:58 - 88:03)
yeah I mean yeah we've got eight bad (88:00 - 88:05)
ones like they (88:03 - 88:08)
they're impossible to follow I don't (88:05 - 88:10)
know if the person was using like a (88:08 - 88:13)
Nokia Nokia cell phone from like 1992 to (88:10 - 88:15)
like GPS track this like I don't know (88:13 - 88:18)
how this happens the ones that I put a (88:15 - 88:21)
lot of effort into making and to put a (88:18 - 88:22)
lot of effort into writing the (88:21 - 88:24)
descriptions on just don't get approved (88:22 - 88:27)
so maybe they don't okay I I've made two (88:24 - 88:29)
routes right like I made one at Stone (88:27 - 88:31)
Arch it's still under review to this day (88:29 - 88:35)
and then I made one in Japan I I went to (88:31 - 88:37)
this cat Shrine but it's like an hour (88:35 - 88:39)
and a half outside of Tokyo it's the (88:37 - 88:41)
shrine that has all the little kitty (88:39 - 88:45)
cats like it's a 10 minute walk from (88:41 - 88:46)
this train station when you get off the (88:45 - 88:49)
train you see a giant cat like you can't (88:46 - 88:52)
miss it and then you walk straight for (88:49 - 88:54)
eight minutes you take a left turn you (88:52 - 88:55)
walk another two minutes and you're (88:54 - 88:57)
there you're at The Shrine and I was (88:55 - 88:58)
like you know what this would be a good (88:57 - 89:01)
route for for anyone being like uh is (88:58 - 89:03)
there any Pokemon go out here sure is (89:01 - 89:05)
we'll take you right to the cat Shrine (89:03 - 89:08)
what a good route it's reversible you (89:05 - 89:09)
can either you can go from the the (89:08 - 89:11)
shrine to back to the train station or (89:09 - 89:12)
you go to the train station to the (89:11 - 89:16)
shrine reversible all that but for both (89:12 - 89:19)
routes I thought about the five tags to (89:16 - 89:21)
use like I did dog friendly for the one (89:19 - 89:22)
in Minnesota because there was a lot of (89:21 - 89:24)
dogs on that route did not do dog (89:22 - 89:26)
friendly for the one in Japan not a lot (89:24 - 89:27)
of dogs in Japan (89:26 - 89:29)
um like I thought about all I thought (89:27 - 89:31)
about the tags I like made sure the (89:29 - 89:33)
capitalization was correct in Japan (89:31 - 89:35)
sometimes there's like a lot of hyphens (89:33 - 89:38)
or a lot of like Japanese Pokemon ease (89:35 - 89:40)
it's not a Japanese Pokemon E but you (89:38 - 89:41)
know everyone knows exactly what I'm (89:40 - 89:44)
saying a little accent above the e (89:41 - 89:46)
um so I like made sure I went to Google (89:44 - 89:49)
Maps and like made sure the typing and (89:46 - 89:51)
the lettering was right to name it Rhoda (89:49 - 89:54)
thought about the description every (89:51 - 89:56)
single route in Mall of America or (89:54 - 89:57)
Centennial Lakes (89:56 - 89:59)
who knows what they named it this is (89:57 - 90:03)
like Billy Hank's boat route start in (89:59 - 90:06)
the ocean and over here by this tree no (90:03 - 90:09)
description no tags who's making this (90:06 - 90:12)
stuff (90:09 - 90:12)
right they're all bad it's not great (90:13 - 90:19)
yeah well the problem that we had it was (90:17 - 90:21)
like we were like well it's right on (90:19 - 90:22)
here I'm like it's called Centennial (90:21 - 90:25)
Lakes Loop it was like there are four of (90:22 - 90:26)
these I'm like yeah well I can't tell (90:25 - 90:29)
you which one of those to pick I picked (90:26 - 90:31)
one maybe we're on the same Centennial (90:29 - 90:34)
is also spelled wrong (90:31 - 90:37)
I got a bunch of them also I can't tell (90:34 - 90:39)
you where the start is because I don't (90:37 - 90:41)
know to be fair Centennial is kind of a (90:39 - 90:44)
hard word to spell don't be fair it's (90:41 - 90:47)
not it's not a little tough (90:44 - 90:49)
hahaha (90:47 - 90:49)
it's a long word I made you our spell (90:50 - 90:57)
Checkers on your phone like (90:54 - 91:00)
I would just expect the reviewing to be (90:57 - 91:02)
a little bit more Discerning considering (91:00 - 91:05)
it's not on Wayfarer yet (91:02 - 91:08)
you can give it a one to five star at (91:05 - 91:10)
the end I don't know if that's actually (91:08 - 91:13)
doing anything oh I gave the one that (91:10 - 91:15)
had me end in the middle of like a one (91:13 - 91:17)
star (91:15 - 91:21)
yeah I I gave the the the the the (91:17 - 91:25)
mall America one on one star because I (91:21 - 91:27)
was like this is a bad loop I actually (91:25 - 91:29)
don't remember what it was even called (91:27 - 91:32)
there was no tags it was called bad Loop (91:29 - 91:35)
oh (91:32 - 91:35)
um overall though I think uh I think (91:35 - 91:40)
Louisville golfers was was really good I (91:37 - 91:43)
I had a good time I'm glad they didn't (91:40 - 91:47)
do only Rayquaza for the second day (91:43 - 91:48)
there was still Goomy there were still (91:47 - 91:50)
Pikachu there was still anymore there (91:48 - 91:52)
was only Rayquaza for me (91:50 - 91:55)
um it would have been nice I know I (91:52 - 91:57)
think Groudon and Kyogre were there for (91:55 - 92:02)
the first hour of everyone's day (91:57 - 92:04)
um there it would be nice to have a (92:02 - 92:06)
little variety like maybe like hey (92:04 - 92:09)
Rayquaza takes a break for an hour of (92:06 - 92:11)
these eight hours and Kyogre round on (92:09 - 92:13)
comes back I don't know they're (92:11 - 92:16)
I I I (92:13 - 92:17)
it feels like it gets a free pass (92:16 - 92:20)
compared to Nile Eagle last year (92:17 - 92:23)
because like it's Rayquaza and it could (92:20 - 92:25)
be Mega and it can be shiny but it was (92:23 - 92:26)
like (92:25 - 92:28)
still kind of the same thing as last (92:26 - 92:29)
year when it was like one Pokemon (92:28 - 92:32)
dominating raids and it was like all the (92:29 - 92:35)
Mega Energy though you do you need a lot (92:32 - 92:36)
of energy (92:35 - 92:39)
so like we're crazy again it gets a free (92:36 - 92:41)
pass because everyone likes for like (92:39 - 92:46)
man I I the ultra Beast thing was so (92:41 - 92:48)
disappointing of like it's not an egg (92:46 - 92:52)
it's a wormhole but it's the same thing (92:48 - 92:54)
here's the eight hours of a new Pokemon (92:52 - 92:56)
that can't be shiny and it's not good (92:54 - 93:00)
for anything cool (92:56 - 93:00)
thanks this one was good though and (93:00 - 93:04)
let's see if they can keep that momentum (93:02 - 93:06)
going (93:04 - 93:09)
yeah I um (93:06 - 93:09)
I don't know how they they top it (93:11 - 93:15)
besides bringing back (93:13 - 93:18)
all the legendaries again (93:15 - 93:19)
I don't know if there's like a legendary (93:18 - 93:21)
that's (93:19 - 93:23)
cool enough (93:21 - 93:25)
Mega Mewtwo (93:23 - 93:28)
you know that's that's you get to know (93:25 - 93:30)
you get two of them that's still gotta (93:28 - 93:32)
show up and they're definitely saving it (93:30 - 93:35)
for something that's true Mega Mewtwo (93:32 - 93:36)
would be it would be a good one I think (93:35 - 93:39)
like having a go Fest that's like (93:36 - 93:41)
all the tapus would be like a good (93:39 - 93:44)
variety but they've already turned the (93:41 - 93:46)
tapu shiny and I don't think any of them (93:44 - 93:48)
are particularly good (93:46 - 93:50)
or exciting (93:48 - 93:53)
but (93:50 - 93:55)
like raid wise (93:53 - 93:57)
like I think it's like Ram outclasses (93:55 - 94:00)
Coco I think Cartana outclass is bulu I (93:57 - 94:02)
know I've seen Finney get some use in (94:00 - 94:04)
PvP but that might have been a personal (94:02 - 94:05)
choice (94:04 - 94:07)
yeah (94:05 - 94:10)
like Rayquaza has a lot of utility on (94:07 - 94:12)
top of just being popular (94:10 - 94:16)
especially with its Mega yeah (94:12 - 94:18)
um (94:16 - 94:18)
also I guess we'll end on this note (94:18 - 94:23)
um (94:21 - 94:23)
I feel bad for people who had to do (94:25 - 94:32)
these Mega raids with like six seven or (94:28 - 94:34)
eight people it's doable for sure (94:32 - 94:36)
definitely (94:34 - 94:41)
but man what a slog like even even with (94:36 - 94:46)
Rayquaza or Groudon or Kyogre (94:41 - 94:49)
like I'm still burning through potions (94:46 - 94:53)
and revives because they just hit so (94:49 - 94:55)
hard like I cannot imagine somebody (94:53 - 94:57)
living (94:55 - 95:00)
in Springfield Illinois (94:57 - 95:02)
that was my second City besides Appleton (95:00 - 95:05)
Wisconsin uh that's like every Groudon (95:02 - 95:08)
they do is like seven people and they're (95:05 - 95:10)
just Groudon was the easy one though (95:08 - 95:13)
Groudon is the easier one yeah (95:10 - 95:13)
the first day (95:16 - 95:20)
Saturday like when people were inviting (95:18 - 95:22)
me to Kyogre and I would join remote (95:20 - 95:24)
raid join in I was like oh you got nine (95:22 - 95:27)
people here no thank you I like I know (95:24 - 95:30)
it's doable but uh you're gonna eat (95:27 - 95:32)
about six minutes of my time yeah (95:30 - 95:34)
because I got invited to one Kyogre and (95:32 - 95:37)
I think we had six people maybe seven (95:34 - 95:39)
took all the way through we had 15 (95:37 - 95:41)
seconds left yeah it went all the way (95:39 - 95:43)
through and you probably went through (95:41 - 95:46)
like 12 Pokemon (95:43 - 95:46)
Who's down to my fourth team like yeah (95:46 - 95:52)
they definitely made raids a lot a lot (95:50 - 95:55)
tougher but tougher but you can capture (95:52 - 95:59)
more easily that counts that helps (95:55 - 95:59)
um so yeah I just I hear that's me (96:00 - 96:08)
saying I feel bad for not being in 20. (96:02 - 96:08)
move to the city (96:08 - 96:14)
it's a city game now (96:10 - 96:17)
at least for the big events (96:14 - 96:17)
uh well all right (96:18 - 96:22)
I'm sure we're forgetting some things (96:20 - 96:23)
they not they announced a lot of (96:22 - 96:26)
community days coming up just a new (96:23 - 96:27)
Pokemon (96:26 - 96:29)
's new Pokemon (96:27 - 96:30)
yeah (96:29 - 96:33)
oh the we can talk about that next week (96:30 - 96:36)
I will be here and I love it (96:33 - 96:38)
I also love it (96:36 - 96:38)
husband's favorite Pokemon isynisty and (96:41 - 96:45)
this is Rock shocked my world because I (96:43 - 96:47)
didn't know he changed (96:45 - 96:47)
what was it before Oddish (96:48 - 96:53)
oh I didn't know that (96:51 - 96:55)
I mean he still really likes Oddish but (96:53 - 96:57)
he changed it to Tennessee and he didn't (96:55 - 97:00)
even tell me he didn't even tell me (96:57 - 97:02)
okay we can talk about the new Pokemon I (97:00 - 97:05)
don't like it what really we're done (97:02 - 97:08)
shut the show down we're gone you are (97:05 - 97:11)
the worst your taste is terrible why do (97:08 - 97:14)
you even exist I like sinisty a lot (97:11 - 97:18)
Dynasty is is an amazing Pokemon I (97:14 - 97:19)
absolutely love sinisty I don't really (97:18 - 97:21)
like polti guys though like it's fine I (97:19 - 97:24)
don't I don't have anything wrong with (97:21 - 97:26)
polti guys but (97:24 - 97:27)
uh it's like how you know people love (97:26 - 97:29)
Charizard but they don't care about (97:27 - 97:30)
Charmeleon (97:29 - 97:32)
that's how I feel about synasty but (97:30 - 97:35)
they're likening this new one to sinisty (97:32 - 97:38)
I know it's named Poltergeist (97:35 - 97:42)
yeah it gives me more Poltergeist but (97:38 - 97:44)
it's because it's big you know like (97:42 - 97:46)
polti guys is bigger it's not that big (97:44 - 97:49)
it's not that big bunch of kids tiny (97:46 - 97:54)
it's cute little teacup I I took a class (97:49 - 97:55)
that was a Japanese tea ceremony class (97:54 - 97:57)
in college and so I'm just super happy (97:55 - 97:59)
for this Pokemon it has the little tea (97:57 - 98:02)
scoop it has a little (97:59 - 98:04)
it's wonderful it's adorable and I want (98:02 - 98:06)
to see if it evolves I'm just happy it (98:04 - 98:07)
exists (98:06 - 98:09)
it's it's incredible yeah I think it's a (98:07 - 98:12)
very cool Pokemon (98:09 - 98:12)
I just not just you know not it's like a (98:13 - 98:20)
top 700 Pokemon for me (98:17 - 98:22)
ouch (98:20 - 98:22)
Sinister you probably like a top 20 for (98:22 - 98:27)
me it also does the Japanese (98:25 - 98:31)
crack or the golden artwork which is (98:27 - 98:33)
yeah outstanding (98:31 - 98:37)
it's so deeply steeped in Japanese lore (98:33 - 98:39)
and everything like it's so on point (98:37 - 98:41)
also (98:39 - 98:43)
you know we have another video of a (98:41 - 98:44)
bunch of kids getting murdered by (98:43 - 98:47)
Pokemon and I'm here for you advertising (98:44 - 98:51)
taxes yeah 100 of their murdered (98:47 - 98:54)
we do their life forces is depleted (98:51 - 98:58)
maybe not okay let me let me ask you (98:54 - 99:00)
this question when your life force is (98:58 - 99:01)
depleted (99:00 - 99:07)
what are you very tired Dead Tired (99:01 - 99:10)
depleted means it's gone (99:07 - 99:13)
you're dead (99:10 - 99:13)
they're not sleeping I like how many (99:13 - 99:17)
Hospitality ability I don't know how I (99:15 - 99:20)
how useful it is but I think it's cute (99:17 - 99:25)
and fitting on theme ah it's like (99:20 - 99:26)
generator (99:25 - 99:28)
except (99:26 - 99:31)
you're bringing it in to heal the thing (99:28 - 99:33)
next to you instead of like a Mungus or (99:31 - 99:35)
yeah what's the other Pokemon that has (99:33 - 99:37)
regenerator uh they switch out and they (99:35 - 99:39)
come back in with more health I don't (99:37 - 99:42)
know if that matters so much if (99:39 - 99:44)
it doesn't it doesn't seem like it would (99:42 - 99:46)
be as consistent as nemungus also a (99:44 - 99:47)
Mungus gets the benefit of just like (99:46 - 99:49)
being a very bulky Pokemon on top of (99:47 - 99:50)
that and having like a good type (99:49 - 99:52)
combination (99:50 - 99:55)
um but oh you'd have to see what like (99:52 - 99:57)
its moves are (99:55 - 100:00)
I think the other thing that like (99:57 - 100:00)
it's fine it's okay but like (100:00 - 100:10)
grass ghost or ghost grass is used a lot (100:05 - 100:16)
it's not used a lot there are five (100:10 - 100:16)
with Evolutions yeah (100:16 - 100:20)
they're a fair amount but I'm not (100:19 - 100:23)
unhappy about that then again I'm also (100:20 - 100:25)
someone who likes firefighting so yeah (100:23 - 100:28)
like let's talk about firefighting for a (100:25 - 100:30)
second (100:28 - 100:30)
uh (100:31 - 100:36)
another grass ghost okay (100:32 - 100:36)
like (100:38 - 100:42)
it's a cool looking Pokemon it's very (100:40 - 100:46)
amazing and I it means that there's no (100:42 - 100:48)
matcha allowed in all of kitakami (100:46 - 100:51)
because matcha is a bad Omen because of (100:48 - 100:53)
this Pokemon and I'm not sure how I feel (100:51 - 100:57)
about that but it's at least amusing (100:53 - 100:57)
yeah are we or do we think it's gonna (101:03 - 101:07)
evolve or do we think there's going to (101:05 - 101:09)
be a (101:07 - 101:11)
do you think that this is a final form (101:09 - 101:14)
or do we think it's going to evolve the (101:11 - 101:16)
only thing that makes me think this is (101:14 - 101:19)
its final form is how often they showed (101:16 - 101:24)
a cracked Cup being repaired like in all (101:19 - 101:27)
of the video they kept focusing on a (101:24 - 101:29)
cracked cup (101:27 - 101:31)
and it could be saying that it's similar (101:29 - 101:33)
to sinisty but it's really weird to have (101:31 - 101:36)
done that much focus on a cracked Cup (101:33 - 101:39)
being repaired for that not to exist in (101:36 - 101:41)
the game (101:39 - 101:41)
I've seen some good mock-ups of really (101:44 - 101:49)
neat Evolutions but I don't necessarily (101:46 - 101:51)
think they would be real I want it to (101:49 - 101:52)
evolve (101:51 - 101:54)
okay fine final question (101:52 - 101:56)
do we think there's going to be an (101:54 - 102:00)
authentic and phony versions (101:56 - 102:02)
I think there will be (102:00 - 102:04)
I don't think it's the little dots on (102:02 - 102:05)
its forehead I don't think it's the dots (102:04 - 102:08)
on this part but it is always that was (102:05 - 102:11)
already proven meant to be yeah (102:08 - 102:13)
that was the lighting (102:11 - 102:14)
yeah (102:13 - 102:16)
I don't feel on the bottom (102:14 - 102:19)
maybe it would maybe it would if it is I (102:16 - 102:22)
hope it's easier to see (102:19 - 102:22)
okay (102:27 - 102:30)
it's 11 o'clock I need to go to bed well (102:28 - 102:32)
I need to edit this then I need to go to (102:30 - 102:33)
bed (102:32 - 102:38)
um so I have more to say about the (102:33 - 102:38)
uh but we can do that next week Greg got (102:40 - 102:45)
