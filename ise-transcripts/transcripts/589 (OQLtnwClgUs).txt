transition here uh we have some Pokemon (1:21 - 1:26)
news for we have some cold Pokemon news (1:23 - 1:28)
how's that sound we're bringing a stuff (1:26 - 1:31)
from 97 (1:28 - 1:34)
there is a Halloween event currently (1:31 - 1:36)
happening in Pokemon scarlet and violet (1:34 - 1:37)
by the time this episode goes up there (1:36 - 1:41)
should still be about 24ish hours of (1:37 - 1:43)
that event left but before we get to (1:41 - 1:45)
that Halloween event there is a (1:43 - 1:48)
Halloween event starting in Pokemon (1:45 - 1:52)
sleep but it is also good sleep day (1:48 - 1:56)
today the day we're recording this (1:52 - 2:00)
so um that's exciting I guess but more (1:56 - 2:01)
important importantly if you're playing (2:00 - 2:03)
the Halloween event for Pokemon sleep (2:01 - 2:05)
you'll want to start (2:03 - 2:09)
on uh Grass Island I don't know what (2:05 - 2:11)
it's called we just talked about it and (2:09 - 2:14)
you were frozen I was frozen you were (2:11 - 2:18)
frozen and we already covered (2:14 - 2:21)
it and if you forget to start on green (2:18 - 2:23)
grass you can use a ticket to move to (2:21 - 2:26)
Green Grass they confirmed that on their (2:23 - 2:32)
official sleep it's not Twitter anymore (2:26 - 2:32)
got it it's like 100 points I think (2:32 - 2:39)
which you get like 2,000 points just for (2:35 - 2:42)
logging in three days CU it's 500 1,500 (2:39 - 2:45)
I think it might be a diamonds (2:42 - 2:47)
ticket I don't think you can use sleep (2:45 - 2:50)
points no I think you can cuz I bought (2:47 - 2:53)
it maybe in the premium store yeah no it (2:50 - 2:57)
was store it was in the regular store in (2:53 - 2:59)
Green Grass Island for like the last (2:57 - 3:00)
month (2:59 - 3:03)
yeah I was on the beach for quite a (3:00 - 3:06)
while (3:03 - 3:06)
jeeez no you (3:06 - 3:11)
were I had (3:08 - 3:15)
almost sleep drama last (3:11 - 3:20)
night go on I went to hit my button this (3:15 - 3:24)
morning and the button did (3:20 - 3:27)
nothing was your thing dead because it (3:24 - 3:30)
died at some point in the mid middle of (3:27 - 3:33)
the night so I had to charge it to see (3:30 - 3:37)
at what point did my (3:33 - 3:41)
sleep button die and it died at the 8 (3:37 - 3:44)
hours and 22 minute (3:41 - 3:46)
marker so if it dies it still remers (3:44 - 3:50)
your data yeah up until it died I slept (3:46 - 3:52)
n hours last night and I'm not getting (3:50 - 3:55)
credit for 40 of those minutes when you (3:52 - 3:57)
connect it does it say that it died no (3:55 - 3:58)
it just says there's a problem (3:57 - 4:00)
communicating and then I hit the button (3:58 - 4:03)
and it did absolutely nothing (4:00 - 4:05)
like I think it's (4:03 - 4:08)
dead yeah so the easy travel ticket is (4:05 - 4:11)
100 sleep points but you only get one of (4:08 - 4:12)
them they're at the it's at the very (4:11 - 4:16)
very bottom of the regular Exchange (4:12 - 4:19)
store ah okay you got to scroll all the (4:16 - 4:22)
way down and then you can buy more with (4:19 - 4:24)
diamonds if you need to team never (4:22 - 4:27)
scroll just if it's not obvious you're (4:24 - 4:29)
never going to find it the reason I knew (4:27 - 4:31)
that is because the first time ever I (4:29 - 4:34)
saw those on what was formerly known as (4:31 - 4:37)
Twitter be very positive that a mobile (4:34 - 4:38)
game made (4:37 - 4:41)
a good (4:38 - 4:43)
choice like oh you didn't charge us (4:41 - 4:45)
diamonds you charge us 100 sleep points (4:43 - 4:47)
for an event that is coming up I I don't (4:45 - 4:50)
know how good this holiday event will be (4:47 - 4:52)
in Pokemon sleep uh good sleep days are (4:50 - 4:54)
pretty solid they kind of remind me of (4:52 - 4:56)
Community Days where there's just really (4:54 - 4:58)
no reason to participate they're they're (4:56 - 5:01)
pretty easy to do they're they're pretty (4:58 - 5:03)
no reason to not participate yeah (5:01 - 5:06)
they're they're well received um (5:03 - 5:08)
everyone seems very excited about this (5:06 - 5:11)
Halloween event and the double candy and (5:08 - 5:15)
the the the Hat Pikachu all that stuff (5:11 - 5:18)
um so I guess we'll report back next (5:15 - 5:21)
week but yeah Halloween event this week (5:18 - 5:23)
in Pokemon (5:21 - 5:27)
sleep breaking news though I (5:23 - 5:30)
think breaking news (5:27 - 5:33)
uh I I think I figured out Pokemon sleep (5:30 - 5:36)
I think I figured it out the the the (5:33 - 5:39)
typings the the sub skills the (5:36 - 5:42)
skills I the calculator that we've been (5:39 - 5:44)
talking about that YouTube comments (5:42 - 5:46)
keeps saying what is this calculator you (5:44 - 5:47)
keep talking (5:46 - 5:51)
about you did a deep dive I did a deep (5:47 - 5:52)
dive yeah I actually did this on my (5:51 - 5:54)
stream my plan is to eventually make (5:52 - 5:56)
like a uh like a 10-minute YouTube video (5:54 - 5:59)
of like here's everything in Pokemon (5:56 - 6:02)
sleep for dumb dummies I'm the dummy by (5:59 - 6:04)
the way but I figured it all out um the (6:02 - 6:07)
first thing that maybe isn't obvious is (6:04 - 6:10)
that Pokemon are broken into three (6:07 - 6:12)
categories uh if you didn't read it's (6:10 - 6:15)
pretty obvious nah n it's right at the (6:12 - 6:18)
top yeah but you don't really think they (6:15 - 6:21)
do anything so I think I think this is (6:18 - 6:25)
obvious no not obvious what's the word (6:21 - 6:26)
once you understand that they're broken (6:25 - 6:29)
into three categories then you can (6:26 - 6:32)
understand what skills you want with (6:29 - 6:34)
those three but that's hard to remember (6:32 - 6:37)
CU there's a bunch of skills so somebody (6:34 - 6:40)
made a skill chart of like if your (6:37 - 6:43)
berries you want like these five skills (6:40 - 6:47)
and that makes it so much easier to look (6:43 - 6:48)
at your Pokemon which is I think the pro (6:47 - 6:50)
that's the problem that's this is the (6:48 - 6:53)
problem everyone has is they have like (6:50 - 6:56)
five sduck and they're like well this (6:53 - 6:58)
Psyduck has a couple gold skills this (6:56 - 7:00)
Psyduck has a bad nature (6:58 - 7:02)
but I don't know if the skills are good (7:00 - 7:05)
I don't know if this nature is the best (7:02 - 7:08)
just looking at this chart you can you (7:05 - 7:11)
can quickly realize that okay Psyduck is (7:08 - 7:13)
I don't know what Psyduck is skills or (7:11 - 7:16)
something Psyduck is skills so these are (7:13 - 7:18)
the five top that work with it the other (7:16 - 7:20)
thing that the game doesn't tell you at (7:18 - 7:24)
all is that the level 10 sub skill the (7:20 - 7:27)
very first one you unlock is so much (7:24 - 7:31)
more important than any of the other (7:27 - 7:35)
ones so like Barry finding s which is (7:31 - 7:36)
like one of the best sub skills it's (7:35 - 7:39)
like a gold one if you got it in like (7:36 - 7:42)
the level 10 spot that is that is (7:39 - 7:45)
awesome there's like a there's like a uh (7:42 - 7:48)
un cuz most Pokemon games don't show you (7:45 - 7:50)
actual hard numbers for anything this (7:48 - 7:52)
isn't this is an exclusive to Pokemon (7:50 - 7:54)
sleep it's like every Pokemon games like (7:52 - 7:58)
we love to have hidden information from (7:54 - 7:58)
you (7:58 - 8:03)
uh but (8:01 - 8:06)
the the whatever ends up being in the (8:03 - 8:09)
first level 10 slot is like (8:06 - 8:12)
1.5 more effective and if you had the (8:09 - 8:16)
same skill in the level 100 slot it's (8:12 - 8:20)
five effective so it (8:16 - 8:24)
really rewards that early game and it (8:20 - 8:26)
again it goes back to helping you make (8:24 - 8:29)
decisions quicker this also takes us (8:26 - 8:30)
back to the (8:29 - 8:33)
calculator and why the calculator makes (8:30 - 8:35)
sense or doesn't make sense because if (8:33 - 8:38)
you're if you're assigning those skills (8:35 - 8:40)
to like an absu which I think absu is (8:38 - 8:42)
actually skills and then you switch to a (8:40 - 8:43)
different (8:42 - 8:45)
Pokemon and you're like oh the (8:43 - 8:47)
calculator is giving the same thing it's (8:45 - 8:49)
probably because that other Pokemon is (8:47 - 8:50)
also (8:49 - 8:53)
skills and that's why it doesn't change (8:50 - 8:55)
that much um that's why it doesn't (8:53 - 8:58)
change when you do like Spiel Celio wall (8:55 - 9:00)
rain because they're all just skills and (8:58 - 9:02)
it's calculating that you can also on (9:00 - 9:04)
the calculator I'll include the (9:02 - 9:05)
calculator in the show notes this week (9:04 - 9:06)
on YouTube by the (9:05 - 9:10)
way because now I understand it um uh (9:06 - 9:11)
and then the other thing about the (9:10 - 9:15)
calculator is like if you had like (9:11 - 9:17)
um like (9:15 - 9:20)
inventory size (9:17 - 9:22)
small technically you can upgrade that (9:20 - 9:24)
to inventory size medium and then you (9:22 - 9:25)
can upgrade it again to inventory Skies (9:24 - 9:27)
large you could just do that on the (9:25 - 9:29)
calculator because you can eventually (9:27 - 9:31)
upgrade those skills and you can see (9:29 - 9:33)
like oh you went from B rank to a rank (9:31 - 9:35)
because you upgraded it so like just (9:33 - 9:37)
because you got like a let's say you got (9:35 - 9:38)
like a Shiny Pokemon and you popped it (9:37 - 9:40)
in the calculator and it was D and (9:38 - 9:42)
you're like ah it's a d rank like (9:40 - 9:45)
ideally if you had subskill seeds and (9:42 - 9:47)
you upgraded them you can just like go (9:45 - 9:49)
from small to medium on the calculator (9:47 - 9:50)
cuz it's not going to change it's only (9:49 - 9:52)
going to upgrade and then you can see (9:50 - 9:54)
like oh I went from D to B okay now I (9:52 - 9:56)
feel better leveling this up the whole (9:54 - 10:00)
point of everything I just explained was (9:56 - 10:02)
I promise you probably have really good (10:00 - 10:05)
Pokemon that you don't know about (10:02 - 10:09)
because the game is so hard to (10:05 - 10:12)
understand just by looking at (10:09 - 10:15)
it it's (10:12 - 10:17)
complicated I just put the shinies in (10:15 - 10:20)
cuz they're pretty and they walk around (10:17 - 10:23)
and I touch them and they give me stuff (10:20 - 10:26)
and then sometimes I make (10:23 - 10:28)
food and then I hit a button to go to (10:26 - 10:31)
sleep (10:28 - 10:31)
um yeah (10:34 - 10:39)
yeah the other big tip is that berries (10:37 - 10:41)
are for early game and cooking is for (10:39 - 10:44)
late game what what are we considering (10:41 - 10:48)
late game once you have more evolved (10:44 - 10:50)
Pokemon more pot more space in your (10:48 - 10:52)
cooking (10:50 - 10:55)
pot good (10:52 - 10:58)
Magnemite a lot of ingredients unlocked (10:55 - 11:02)
m I uh yeah what is I'm not sure what (10:58 - 11:04)
other people consider late game but I I (11:02 - 11:06)
get way more of my ingredients through (11:04 - 11:10)
cooking like I am making (11:06 - 11:13)
pretty like I'm making 20 plus recipes (11:10 - 11:15)
and then I'm filling the last like eight (11:13 - 11:18)
or nine with just filler but I'm (11:15 - 11:20)
actually making recipes I think really (11:18 - 11:22)
early (11:20 - 11:25)
on you're making like whatever like (11:22 - 11:29)
seven honey makes like honey Curry and (11:25 - 11:33)
that that is like okay but when you (11:29 - 11:37)
start making the there's like a like (11:33 - 11:38)
again I I don't know the re like there's (11:37 - 11:41)
one recipe that's like plus 800 and then (11:38 - 11:43)
there's another one that's like plus (11:41 - 11:46)
3,000 and when when you consistently (11:43 - 11:48)
making I think based on how many times (11:46 - 11:51)
you've made that recipe and you can't (11:48 - 11:53)
make a lot of the recipes if you don't (11:51 - 11:56)
have enough space in your cooking pot (11:53 - 11:57)
and you can't make some of the better (11:56 - 11:59)
ones if you don't have some of the (11:57 - 12:00)
ingred ingredients that you can only get (11:59 - 12:03)
by leveling up (12:00 - 12:03)
Pokémon (12:04 - 12:09)
yeah but I think early also the other (12:06 - 12:12)
problem with early game I'm air quoting (12:09 - 12:14)
is that you might not have a variety of (12:12 - 12:16)
those ingredients (12:14 - 12:19)
mhm (12:16 - 12:21)
um so (12:19 - 12:24)
it's I don't know I'm like most of my (12:21 - 12:26)
Pokemon are like maybe like level 18 and (12:24 - 12:30)
20 and I feel like I'm going all in on (12:26 - 12:33)
ingredients but if I look back like N9 (12:30 - 12:35)
weeks ago I was just like using like (12:33 - 12:39)
autoc cook because I didn't yep I didn't (12:35 - 12:41)
know what to do so I think that's (12:39 - 12:47)
like uh yeah I mean I just hit day 100 (12:41 - 12:50)
since I think I missed one day in there (12:47 - 12:53)
and I made a dish this morning that was (12:50 - 12:57)
uh 38,000 sleep point or points to my (12:53 - 12:59)
Snorlax that boosted me all the way up (12:57 - 13:01)
from Master One to Master 2 on my (12:59 - 13:03)
Snorlax that's great but I could not (13:01 - 13:06)
have made that without uh leveling up my (13:03 - 13:08)
cooking pot without a Magnemite to boost (13:06 - 13:11)
it even bigger or like a good camp (13:08 - 13:16)
ticket would boost it or that yep yeah I (13:11 - 13:18)
if it would be I I kind of like regret (13:16 - 13:21)
using a good C Camp ticket like week two (13:18 - 13:23)
regrets like it's not that big of a deal (13:21 - 13:26)
cuz I wanted to see what it did but like (13:23 - 13:28)
when you're so early on in the game (13:26 - 13:30)
using a good camp ticket to like double (13:28 - 13:31)
your pot it's like you're doubling it (13:30 - 13:33)
for nothing because you just started the (13:31 - 13:35)
game and you're like you have like two (13:33 - 13:37)
charmanders and they're just getting you (13:35 - 13:39)
nothing but sausage you're like what am (13:37 - 13:42)
I doing with this I have nothing else (13:39 - 13:43)
like I'm still to the there are still (13:42 - 13:46)
ingredients that I don't have like (13:43 - 13:48)
there's like leaks and I think mushrooms (13:46 - 13:51)
and stuff and a Slowpoke tail those are (13:48 - 13:53)
those are more late game cuz you'll see (13:51 - 13:55)
like none of your (13:53 - 13:58)
Pokemon uh can get those ingredients (13:55 - 13:59)
until like you're level 30 I don't think (13:58 - 14:01)
there's a single Pokémon out there that (13:59 - 14:02)
like their first ingredient is like (14:01 - 14:06)
mushroom or Slowpoke tail um so those (14:02 - 14:08)
are even more advanced (14:06 - 14:11)
recipes but uh it's a cool game every (14:08 - 14:13)
time I make a Pokemon sleep post on (14:11 - 14:15)
Instagram there's always people that are (14:13 - 14:18)
like this isn't even a game it's like (14:15 - 14:21)
brother you have no clue how deep this (14:18 - 14:22)
goes (14:21 - 14:25)
you this is I got (14:22 - 14:28)
spreadsheets I got (14:25 - 14:31)
calculators I'm like comparing sixsy (14:28 - 14:33)
duck to figure out which one's going to (14:31 - 14:35)
the grinder and which one I'm leveling (14:33 - 14:38)
up you have no clue this is one of the (14:35 - 14:41)
most advanced games I've ever (14:38 - 14:45)
played I'm sleeping good (14:41 - 14:45)
tonight (14:47 - 14:53)
anyways shifting gears over to Pokemon (14:49 - 14:56)
scarlet and violet there are new mass (14:53 - 14:58)
outbreaks they announced more mass (14:56 - 15:00)
outbreaks this is (14:58 - 15:03)
awesome again I will say it again this (15:00 - 15:04)
is something that should have been in (15:03 - 15:08)
the game 10 months ago uh uh but they (15:04 - 15:10)
are doing so the first mass outbreak we (15:08 - 15:12)
got was the Clefairy event uh they made (15:10 - 15:15)
Clefairy spawn all over Pala and kitami (15:12 - 15:17)
this is great because even if you didn't (15:15 - 15:19)
have the DLC you can hunt this Clefairy (15:17 - 15:22)
event which Clefairy was part of the DLC (15:19 - 15:26)
so you know to the five people out there (15:22 - 15:29)
who are still like they're selling us (15:26 - 15:30)
back (15:29 - 15:33)
Pokemon that brother I got to talk to my (15:30 - 15:35)
brother a lot this episode uh they've (15:33 - 15:38)
been selling you Pokemon for 26 years (15:35 - 15:40)
Pokemon Red and Blue are not (15:38 - 15:43)
free they've been selling you Pokemon (15:40 - 15:45)
for a long time uh but if you didn't (15:43 - 15:47)
want to buy the DLC and you didn't have (15:45 - 15:49)
any friends to trade with for Clefairy (15:47 - 15:51)
that would have been an easy way to be (15:49 - 15:53)
like oh here I can get a Clefairy and I (15:51 - 15:56)
don't need the DLC to do that um they (15:53 - 15:58)
they put it everywhere on the map on the (15:56 - 16:01)
Mass outbreaks I personally feel like (15:58 - 16:04)
those mass outbreaks spawned more than a (16:01 - 16:06)
normal outbreak I just felt like there (16:04 - 16:10)
was more Clefairy than there was like (16:06 - 16:13)
flittle or we the the standard flittle (16:10 - 16:16)
or weezel outbreak um and then they had (16:13 - 16:19)
a 5% chance of having a mark so that was (16:16 - 16:21)
boosted not the shiny odds um you could (16:19 - 16:24)
still obviously make a sandwich have the (16:21 - 16:27)
shiny charm shiny hunt it shiny hunt it (16:24 - 16:29)
with the Mark um (16:27 - 16:32)
the title power didn't stack with the (16:29 - 16:34)
mark so it's still a one in 20 for that (16:32 - 16:37)
Mark for Clefairy it was upbeat for this (16:34 - 16:41)
Halloween event it is Crafty um but you (16:37 - 16:42)
can still get other marks you could (16:41 - 16:46)
still get humongo personality weather um (16:42 - 16:50)
sociable uh or the upbeat Mark and again (16:46 - 16:53)
in this case it's going to be crafty but (16:50 - 16:55)
instead of doing one Pokemon they did (16:53 - 17:01)
four they did uh Phantom drifloon mimiku (16:55 - 17:06)
and gevard so two of those (17:01 - 17:06)
Pokemon wait yeah two of those Pokemon (17:06 - 17:10)
were DLC (17:08 - 17:12)
related wait one of those Pokemon were (17:10 - 17:16)
DLC related trevant or Phantom sorry but (17:12 - 17:20)
the other one drifloon was version (17:16 - 17:23)
exclusive so that was cool so if you (17:20 - 17:25)
were a Scarlet player that's probably (17:23 - 17:27)
not that big of a deal to you but if you (17:25 - 17:28)
were a violet player that was the first (17:27 - 17:30)
time you could Mass outbreak you could (17:28 - 17:31)
outbreak (17:30 - 17:35)
hunt drifloon and then on the flip side (17:31 - 17:39)
in raids they did a five-star Mis megus (17:35 - 17:42)
raid where yes they've done Mis megus (17:39 - 17:44)
before they actually did a Mis megus (17:42 - 17:48)
drift Blum five star Raid event like (17:44 - 17:51)
eight months ago um (17:48 - 17:54)
so Scarlet players could get access to (17:51 - 17:57)
miss megus (17:54 - 18:00)
again but I guess I think Violet players (17:57 - 18:02)
for the first time got the better deal (18:00 - 18:07)
of having drifloon in the wild so may (18:02 - 18:09)
the first W that violot players have (18:07 - 18:12)
gotten because they got they got screwed (18:09 - 18:15)
on everything (18:12 - 18:17)
else you didn't even get the good (18:15 - 18:20)
legendary they didn't even get the good (18:17 - 18:23)
legendary kon's the better legendary (18:20 - 18:26)
unfortunately uh did you guys Mass (18:23 - 18:30)
outbreak heck no not yet (18:26 - 18:30)
there's nothing I find fun about mass (18:30 - 18:35)
outbreaks I'm G to be real honest really (18:32 - 18:37)
here's a question for you Greg did you (18:35 - 18:39)
like SOS did you like horde hunting did (18:37 - 18:41)
you like chain fishing no I don't like (18:39 - 18:44)
any of (18:41 - 18:44)
it not g to g to say you're not a (18:46 - 18:53)
softare setting fan either it's not a (18:48 - 18:56)
huge it's just not a Hu like the thing (18:53 - 19:00)
is SOS felt (18:56 - 19:02)
much more said it than forget it I I (19:00 - 19:05)
really don't (19:02 - 19:08)
like how much I have to (19:05 - 19:12)
like really get on some opera glasses to (19:08 - 19:14)
stare at the tiny Sprites on my screen (19:12 - 19:16)
to see if it's slightly different color (19:14 - 19:18)
in scarlet and violet and there's no (19:16 - 19:21)
sort of outward noise there's no sort of (19:18 - 19:24)
outward indication like in SOS I was in (19:21 - 19:26)
the Battle and I could see (19:24 - 19:30)
it out in the wild I'm like I don't know (19:26 - 19:31)
I don't know what if you're looking for (19:30 - 19:33)
a Mark you wouldn't see it anyways yeah (19:31 - 19:36)
and I'm like this is just not I don't I (19:33 - 19:39)
don't care I I can't do other things (19:36 - 19:41)
while I'm trying to do it I can't just (19:39 - 19:43)
sort of mindlessly be watching a TV show (19:41 - 19:46)
and checking I have to like (19:43 - 19:48)
actually because my (19:46 - 19:53)
are what for outbreaks yeah I think you (19:48 - 19:55)
could I mean my brain is pretty off when (19:53 - 19:57)
I'm (19:55 - 19:59)
doing you also I have a bunch of people (19:57 - 20:01)
in a chat screaming when you've missed (19:59 - 20:04)
something I'm watching TV and paying (20:01 - 20:07)
zero attention in dealing with my dogs (20:04 - 20:09)
and I can't like if it's on the handheld (20:07 - 20:11)
mode I can't see anything I'm like I (20:09 - 20:14)
can't I can't see these it's too small I (20:11 - 20:16)
mean I'm playing on a bigger screen it (20:14 - 20:17)
has to be on the big screen which means (20:16 - 20:20)
I can do nothing else the only time I'm (20:17 - 20:21)
in handheld mode is when I'm sitting on (20:20 - 20:26)
a plane like throwing Pokemon (20:21 - 20:26)
away I use handheld all the time cuz I (20:26 - 20:31)
don't own a TV yeah but at least I have (20:28 - 20:33)
an OLED yeah I don't have an OLED is (20:31 - 20:36)
good looking I just don't have that I (20:33 - 20:38)
don't have that eyesight anymore I don't (20:36 - 20:42)
have the ability to differentiate the (20:38 - 20:43)
Shadows very well a lot of the times (20:42 - 20:45)
like is it in is it a different color (20:43 - 20:47)
because it's in Shadow is it a different (20:45 - 20:50)
color because it's in light I don't know (20:47 - 20:53)
I I don't find massed (20:50 - 20:57)
outbreaks an enjoyable way to spend my (20:53 - 20:59)
time (20:57 - 21:01)
I mean that's fine like not there are (20:59 - 21:03)
some people that just don't even care (21:01 - 21:06)
about shiny hunting at all yeah I I I (21:03 - 21:10)
only like certain shinies anyways I only (21:06 - 21:12)
want specific things to be the slightly (21:10 - 21:15)
different color uh and since they made (21:12 - 21:18)
breeding so much worse in this game like (21:15 - 21:21)
I just I can't even do that like every (21:18 - 21:23)
time I try (21:21 - 21:26)
within one set I'm like this is bad I'm (21:23 - 21:30)
done I'm out I hate this (21:26 - 21:34)
uh did any of you do the Miss magius (21:30 - 21:34)
raids gosh you guys are killing me right (21:34 - 21:44)
now uh I did I I did a handful um again (21:37 - 21:44)
to Instagram you're a bunch of (21:44 - 21:50)
liars (21:48 - 21:53)
I you know most most people in general (21:50 - 21:55)
Liars we we had the whole Animal (21:53 - 21:58)
Crossing debacle where everyone lied (21:55 - 22:00)
about time traveling and then I realized (21:58 - 22:02)
you just can't trust a single person (22:00 - 22:04)
because their definition of time (22:02 - 22:06)
traveling is some weird mental (22:04 - 22:09)
gymnastics of I didn't I only went (22:06 - 22:11)
backwards in time that's not time TR no (22:09 - 22:13)
you time travel that's fine if you (22:11 - 22:15)
changed the time you were time traveling (22:13 - 22:18)
I decided to uh (22:15 - 22:20)
take (22:18 - 22:23)
the advice like you know you know how PE (22:20 - 22:26)
like I I'll post like hey here's here's (22:23 - 22:29)
Miss magius here's its move set um here (22:26 - 22:30)
a couple I like I suggested a couple (22:29 - 22:32)
Pokémon like I didn't do like hard CS (22:30 - 22:35)
but you know I was like huian samur is a (22:32 - 22:37)
really good here because uh the Water (22:35 - 22:40)
resists the mystical fire it's dark type (22:37 - 22:41)
right like there's really nothing that (22:40 - 22:44)
it can do suggesting it in the the (22:41 - 22:45)
possibility of (22:44 - 22:48)
like people are bad at (22:45 - 22:51)
raids people are just bad at like I (22:48 - 22:53)
don't know what to bring I'm just G uh (22:51 - 22:57)
like it's fine when I say that it's like (22:53 - 22:59)
not everyone has the type chart (22:57 - 23:01)
memorized uh not everyone is good at (22:59 - 23:03)
Pokemon not everyone is good at video (23:01 - 23:05)
games it's totally okay here are like (23:03 - 23:06)
five Pokemon so you don't have to think (23:05 - 23:08)
too hard you probably have a grim snarl (23:06 - 23:09)
you probably have like whatever these (23:08 - 23:12)
are these are decent Pokemon and there (23:09 - 23:14)
was a couple comments that were like I (23:12 - 23:16)
use like urshifu and I Swords Dance once (23:14 - 23:19)
and then I I I one shot (23:16 - 23:23)
it you're lying I tested this you are (23:19 - 23:26)
just flat out lying one Swords Dance (23:23 - 23:29)
adamant Max (23:26 - 23:32)
uh attack U with black glasses or even (23:29 - 23:34)
Choice band which does more does not (23:32 - 23:37)
onot I tell it it does you're you're (23:34 - 23:39)
just literally lying in the comments (23:37 - 23:45)
what does work is if uh it (23:39 - 23:47)
was uh if you were plus two which is the (23:45 - 23:49)
same Swords Dance and then somebody else (23:47 - 23:52)
attack cheered you didn't include that (23:49 - 23:56)
that that that like and I get it like I (23:52 - 23:57)
I could sit there and I could Swords (23:56 - 24:00)
Dance twice twice but that's but that's (23:57 - 24:02)
not what you said you didn't say two (24:00 - 24:06)
sword dances you said one sword dance (24:02 - 24:06)
like could have been misinformation they (24:07 - 24:11)
could have not known that someone had (24:09 - 24:14)
attacked cheered that's true or they (24:11 - 24:17)
could have just done one miss magius (24:14 - 24:18)
raid and it just happened that that Miss (24:17 - 24:22)
magius was negative defense nature and (24:18 - 24:25)
it worked once and they did it once and (24:22 - 24:30)
they rolled over the point being is (24:25 - 24:30)
I I test so much and then when I when I (24:31 - 24:37)
put up like actual raid builds of like (24:34 - 24:39)
hey this is what you should use against (24:37 - 24:43)
like a sevenstar tyion or whatever uh (24:39 - 24:44)
that's because like I ran the Cals and (24:43 - 24:48)
like even if tyan in the sun has (24:44 - 24:51)
eruption and it's at 90% Health this (24:48 - 24:55)
Pokemon Will Survive two of those right (24:51 - 24:59)
like um it's fine I just want to call (24:55 - 25:01)
out that you all are liars it's fine (24:59 - 25:02)
except you're all our Liars you (25:01 - 25:04)
shouldn't be trusted don't know how (25:02 - 25:07)
toest and just because you like you did (25:04 - 25:11)
it one time like does it mean that there (25:07 - 25:13)
still isn't 25 different natures and (25:11 - 25:16)
different like it's fine you guys are (25:13 - 25:20)
just a bunch of liars um the missb raids (25:16 - 25:23)
are not as good as the Blissey raids um (25:20 - 25:28)
I X XL candy is better than rare candy (25:23 - 25:31)
until you get to like level 90 and then (25:28 - 25:33)
really if you want to be really (25:31 - 25:34)
Technical and really efficient with your (25:33 - 25:37)
candy you'll like EXL until you get to (25:34 - 25:38)
like level 90 and then you top off with (25:37 - 25:39)
rare (25:38 - 25:43)
candy um because rare candy is better (25:39 - 25:46)
closer to 100 than it is early but (25:43 - 25:49)
overall XL candy is better because you (25:46 - 25:52)
can go from like level like five to 90 (25:49 - 25:55)
with like 30 XL candy and that would (25:52 - 26:02)
take you 90 85 regular rare candy (25:55 - 26:06)
um but uh I think the rewards for that (26:02 - 26:09)
were decent I think it I think overall (26:06 - 26:11)
it is worth losing your Blissey rids for (26:09 - 26:13)
the people who like to like not connect (26:11 - 26:15)
to the internet to keep raids I think it (26:13 - 26:17)
is worth losing it because you do get (26:15 - 26:20)
the outbreaks and the Mis Magus the (26:17 - 26:21)
other thing you can do is you can eat a (26:20 - 26:24)
ghost type sandwich so you get more (26:21 - 26:26)
drops per mmus whereas the Blissey was (26:24 - 26:29)
like well this Blissey electric and this (26:26 - 26:30)
one's fire and this one's fighting and (26:29 - 26:33)
it's like you can't eat one sandwich to (26:30 - 26:35)
like match that but you can eat one (26:33 - 26:38)
ghost sandwich cuz all of the Mis megus (26:35 - 26:40)
are ghost and you can get more raid (26:38 - 26:42)
reward drops there so that's like (26:40 - 26:46)
convenient so (26:42 - 26:49)
um I I I think I think (26:46 - 26:53)
overall having like a pretty easy five (26:49 - 26:55)
for the record like Miss Magus is very (26:53 - 26:57)
easy you don't need to like one sh even (26:55 - 26:59)
if you don't one sh it's very easy raid (26:57 - 27:01)
um that being said I think having a (26:59 - 27:04)
pretty easy five-star raid and an (27:01 - 27:09)
outbreak event is cool uh and it they (27:04 - 27:10)
you know it doesn't end on Sunday it (27:09 - 27:12)
ends on like Tuesday they extend it a (27:10 - 27:16)
little bit more I don't know if I like (27:12 - 27:19)
like four (27:16 - 27:21)
Pokemon yeah that makes it a little less (27:19 - 27:24)
like a Community Day a little harder to (27:21 - 27:26)
kind of show off what you've gotten and (27:24 - 27:28)
compare it to what everybody else (27:26 - 27:29)
getting on social (27:28 - 27:32)
media yeah yeah yeah cuz like everyone (27:29 - 27:35)
was sharing Clefairy and now it's (27:32 - 27:37)
like it feels a little L like that's (27:35 - 27:40)
it's not the worst problem it it does (27:37 - 27:43)
not dilute but it's like ah I only have (27:40 - 27:46)
like four graveyards and like three of (27:43 - 27:48)
them are in kind of like bad spots also (27:46 - 27:51)
like phant up spaming spam spawning on (27:48 - 27:53)
the water no one wants to hunt on the (27:51 - 27:56)
water that's like the (27:53 - 27:59)
worst uh (27:56 - 28:02)
um but like I don't know I always like (27:59 - 28:04)
with the cfair I was like oh they're (28:02 - 28:05)
always going to pick one Pokemon so it (28:04 - 28:08)
was just interesting that they picked (28:05 - 28:10)
four I mean they're going all in for (28:08 - 28:13)
Halloween as they (28:10 - 28:13)
do um yeah so um go get your crafty Mark (28:13 - 28:22)
unless you don't care about it but (28:18 - 28:24)
um the other (28:22 - 28:27)
small nice thing about these events is (28:24 - 28:29)
these Pokémon spawn in places they don't (28:27 - 28:33)
normally spawn so this is like one of (28:29 - 28:37)
the only times you could get a like Gard (28:33 - 28:41)
griver gri griver uh with a sandstorm (28:37 - 28:44)
mark because if it spawned in the (28:41 - 28:47)
desert uh that's the only time you could (28:44 - 28:49)
legitimately get it with a sandstorm (28:47 - 28:51)
Mark which is cool if you care about (28:49 - 28:54)
that kind of stuff um there's like a lot (28:51 - 28:56)
of little things um with these outbreaks (28:54 - 28:58)
that maybe people don't think think of (28:56 - 29:00)
that other people who like I don't (28:58 - 29:01)
really care about chines but I want a (29:00 - 29:03)
gevard with the sandstorm because I want (29:01 - 29:06)
it to be like the sand like just cool (29:03 - 29:09)
stuff if if you care about that I feel (29:06 - 29:10)
like that's a whole lot cooler than the (29:09 - 29:11)
events (29:10 - 29:14)
Mark The Crafty one yeah yeah I do think (29:11 - 29:18)
Sandstorm is cooler than (29:14 - 29:18)
crafty um I had it thunderstorming when (29:19 - 29:24)
I was hunting gri and I was like man I (29:22 - 29:26)
would definitely take a thunder struck (29:24 - 29:28)
Mark over crafty (29:26 - 29:30)
and then all of a sudden stops (29:28 - 29:32)
thunderstorming and I was like no I'll (29:30 - 29:36)
come back set up raining (29:32 - 29:38)
again uh final bit of scarlet and violet (29:36 - 29:41)
news here before we take a break uh Hey (29:38 - 29:42)
if you (29:41 - 29:46)
forgot uh the physical release of the (29:42 - 29:48)
Scarlet and violet Hidden Treasure of (29:46 - 29:51)
Aries zero are is coming out Friday (29:48 - 29:54)
November 3rd this week (29:51 - 29:59)
it's here with only half the DLC because (29:54 - 30:05)
um it it's not it needs to be on shelves (29:59 - 30:09)
yep I'm probably going to take my L here (30:05 - 30:12)
H and I I I said I really think the DLC (30:09 - 30:15)
is going to come out in (30:12 - 30:18)
November um I gu I mean I guess we have (30:15 - 30:22)
what we have two more Fridays for it to (30:18 - 30:24)
come out because it can't come out this (30:22 - 30:27)
weekend cuz they would have already said (30:24 - 30:29)
it (30:27 - 30:31)
uh so we have the 10th and the (30:29 - 30:34)
17th and then the 24th is obviously (30:31 - 30:37)
Thanksgiving um and then after that is (30:34 - 30:41)
technically December so um unless you (30:37 - 30:43)
know in the next like two days they (30:41 - 30:44)
announce like a (30:43 - 30:49)
trailer uh my my expectation for the (30:44 - 30:52)
DLC is probably like maybe maybe I'm (30:49 - 30:54)
going to change in my head I'm going to (30:52 - 30:59)
change to December 8th or 15th (30:54 - 31:02)
um but I did like my whole argument was (30:59 - 31:03)
like there's no way they don't put (31:02 - 31:06)
something out before Black Friday (31:03 - 31:08)
technically they're doing that they're (31:06 - 31:09)
putting something on shelves they're (31:08 - 31:12)
putting on on shelves I didn't think in (31:09 - 31:14)
a million years they would put it out (31:12 - 31:17)
without the other part of the DLC like (31:14 - 31:20)
not on the cartridge like I I I (31:17 - 31:25)
understand it but also like from a (31:20 - 31:28)
preservation slash I don't have internet (31:25 - 31:32)
standpoint that is wild to me like I (31:28 - 31:34)
understand why like fortnite or Apex (31:32 - 31:37)
Legend is on shelves at Target or Best (31:34 - 31:40)
Buy or Walmart because grandma's going (31:37 - 31:42)
to walk in she's going to be like my son (31:40 - 31:44)
likes fortnite wait Grandma's my (31:42 - 31:47)
grandson likes fortnite I'm going to (31:44 - 31:49)
grab it off the shelf I understand that (31:47 - 31:51)
the the the power of something being on (31:49 - 31:54)
the Shelf is very important and (31:51 - 31:56)
obviously there's nothing in the (31:54 - 31:57)
fortnite case besides like like a (31:56 - 32:02)
digital code to redeem I I totally get (31:57 - 32:02)
it but like I would (32:02 - 32:10)
buy a game like detective Pikachu (32:06 - 32:12)
returns physically so when the (32:10 - 32:15)
apocalypse happens and I'm underneath my (32:12 - 32:17)
desk and I have no internet I can think (32:15 - 32:20)
to myself I can play this game I can (32:17 - 32:22)
play this game I don't want to but I (32:20 - 32:25)
could I could I could pop this game in (32:22 - 32:29)
right now and see Goodman's iconic red (32:25 - 32:32)
hoodie which is a line they used in that (32:29 - 32:34)
video G yeah did you finally finish it I (32:32 - 32:36)
did I really actually like the ending (32:34 - 32:39)
the ending is the (32:36 - 32:42)
ending the twist at the end was a it (32:39 - 32:45)
actually got me what (32:42 - 32:49)
twist I I we had we'd have to put a (32:45 - 32:52)
spoiler thing like what what the bad guy (32:49 - 32:56)
was trying to do the entire (32:52 - 32:56)
time (32:56 - 33:00)
can we are we putting a spoiler (32:58 - 33:02)
warning yeah we can talk about this when (33:00 - 33:04)
we on break but I don't I don't think (33:02 - 33:06)
that was a Twist I mean it's already (33:04 - 33:08)
been what three weeks four weeks almost (33:06 - 33:11)
a month me it will take them a month to (33:08 - 33:14)
finish that slow moving game (33:11 - 33:17)
so so let's let's be real some of the (33:14 - 33:18)
people have not finished that game (33:17 - 33:21)
here's a Hu a huge spoiler warning for (33:18 - 33:24)
detective Pikachu here you (33:21 - 33:27)
go I once I got to like the beginning of (33:24 - 33:32)
chapter 5 I was like oh I understand (33:27 - 33:35)
they're he wants to merge with Mewtwo (33:32 - 33:38)
just like in the movie CU that's what (33:35 - 33:40)
happens in the movie he the the bad guy (33:38 - 33:44)
merges with Mewtwo and then becomes (33:40 - 33:47)
Mewtwo and I was like this makes sense (33:44 - 33:49)
because earlier in the game they had the (33:47 - 33:52)
beedrills chasing down Mewtwo so I (33:49 - 33:56)
expected going into that final chamber (33:52 - 33:58)
with Mewtwo being being there and the (33:56 - 34:00)
guy being like I'm plugging myself into (33:58 - 34:03)
Mewtwo and I'm going to become Mewtwo (34:00 - 34:07)
that's what I expected so when the gem (34:03 - 34:10)
turned into Deoxys and Deoxys that's (34:07 - 34:12)
that's where I that's where I get that (34:10 - 34:16)
wasn't a spoiler because they told you a (34:12 - 34:20)
while ago that that gem was a (34:16 - 34:23)
Pokemon from outer (34:20 - 34:28)
space they clearly said the Aurora drop (34:23 - 34:29)
is a (34:28 - 34:32)
Pokemon from outer (34:29 - 34:35)
space I might have missed that they say (34:32 - 34:37)
it was a Pokemon they said it was from (34:35 - 34:40)
outer space yeah I remember them saying (34:37 - 34:41)
it was from outer space that was the (34:40 - 34:43)
whole second chapter they will it will (34:41 - 34:44)
turn into a (34:43 - 34:47)
Pokemon I just thought the gem had the (34:44 - 34:49)
power that he needed to merge with (34:47 - 34:52)
Mewtwo I see so when Deoxys busted out (34:49 - 34:54)
of the thing and me and Deoxys started (34:52 - 34:56)
fighting I was like this game went from (34:54 - 34:59)
like a four out of 10 to like a seven (34:56 - 35:02)
out of 10 oh you're too high that fight (34:59 - 35:05)
scene was so cool okay but tell me how (35:02 - 35:07)
did you feel in chapter 4 when you were (35:05 - 35:09)
switching between the two (35:07 - 35:11)
perspectives (35:09 - 35:16)
um I think that chapter 4 was would (35:11 - 35:18)
probably have been better if it wasn't (35:16 - 35:22)
for chapter 3 mhm and I think overall (35:18 - 35:26)
chapter 4 is the one was like the best (35:22 - 35:28)
storytelling chap chapter but like the (35:26 - 35:34)
worst game chapter like the lore of (35:28 - 35:38)
Harry and Pikachu was good was really (35:34 - 35:42)
good it was super good seeing Pokemon (35:38 - 35:44)
grow up like going back in time and (35:42 - 35:46)
saying oh like you're a you're a bunnel (35:44 - 35:48)
bee but now in the current time you're a (35:46 - 35:51)
diggers be that was super cool like just (35:48 - 35:53)
seeing how Harry and Pikachu met was (35:51 - 35:55)
great like Harry booping Pikachu that (35:53 - 35:58)
alone was like oh my God gosh like this (35:55 - 36:02)
chapter is like worth it um but as (35:58 - 36:05)
like a like as a (36:02 - 36:08)
game part like it felt like they didn't (36:05 - 36:13)
even try yep like the the the Pokemon (36:08 - 36:15)
movie like the the ride Pokemon in (36:13 - 36:18)
chapter 4 was uh Pangoro which was like (36:15 - 36:20)
oh okay you're doing something with (36:18 - 36:22)
Pangoro now but it was like the worst (36:20 - 36:24)
strength puzzles in the entire it didn't (36:22 - 36:27)
even like feel good to control also I (36:24 - 36:29)
kept (36:27 - 36:32)
waiting like a lot of relationships they (36:29 - 36:35)
set up I kept waiting for Pikachu to (36:32 - 36:38)
make the connection that this was the (36:35 - 36:42)
Pancham that you were protecting and (36:38 - 36:44)
they would have a moment of more (36:42 - 36:46)
recognition and that just never happens (36:44 - 36:48)
they're like for all I care you're a (36:46 - 36:50)
completely different one I'm like but (36:48 - 36:52)
that was the origin story like you were (36:50 - 36:55)
there yeah there's no there's nothing (36:52 - 36:57)
there's no payoff there's no connection (36:55 - 36:58)
it's like there's no payoff with the (36:57 - 37:01)
family either I'm like okay so cool the (36:58 - 37:03)
sister could understand Pikachu the (37:01 - 37:05)
entire time (37:03 - 37:08)
and nothing with the divorce nothing (37:05 - 37:09)
with the divorce nothing nothing with (37:08 - 37:12)
the sister nothing I'm like when the (37:09 - 37:14)
sister was like I understood Pikachu (37:12 - 37:16)
again I thought that was a good twist it (37:14 - 37:19)
I mean it it wasn't a Twist I mean or (37:16 - 37:20)
like like a little shock value it was (37:19 - 37:22)
like it was like oh okay (37:20 - 37:25)
confirmed what does that mean what does (37:22 - 37:27)
that do for the game what are you (37:25 - 37:30)
telling us nothing you're telling us (37:27 - 37:32)
nothing okay they got a divorce but he (37:30 - 37:33)
really didn't mean it but I have his (37:32 - 37:37)
ring cool what does that mean what do (37:33 - 37:40)
you and then you're just all a family at (37:37 - 37:44)
the end and like there's no sort of (37:40 - 37:47)
like there's so much wasted potential in (37:44 - 37:49)
that in so many things they set up and (37:47 - 37:52)
we just like and drop and we're going to (37:49 - 37:56)
drop that off to the side like I don't (37:52 - 37:58)
if I I would have spent 50 bucks on it (37:56 - 37:59)
for full disclosure I was sent it for (37:58 - 38:01)
free from Nintendo if I would have spent (37:59 - 38:03)
50 bucks on it I would have still been (38:01 - 38:05)
happy with (38:03 - 38:08)
it um because I I do think the first (38:05 - 38:12)
detective Pikachu is a better game but I (38:08 - 38:16)
was happy with the payoff of the story (38:12 - 38:19)
minus the things they introduced with (38:16 - 38:21)
probably the intention to answer but (38:19 - 38:24)
then didn't like why did you like (38:21 - 38:26)
somebody mentioned that like they do (38:24 - 38:28)
mention your wife in the first game and (38:26 - 38:30)
I was like oh I did okay I believe you I (38:28 - 38:31)
don't I don't remember that but I (38:30 - 38:33)
believe you but like confirm they do not (38:31 - 38:36)
mention that Tim has a sister like uh (38:33 - 38:39)
like so why so they clearly they brought (38:36 - 38:42)
the sister in then they were like okay (38:39 - 38:44)
she understands (38:42 - 38:47)
Pikachu it's like they just R like they (38:44 - 38:50)
were like we we we we we ran out of time (38:47 - 38:52)
this part of the story didn't work how (38:50 - 38:55)
could they brought out a time in 5 (38:52 - 38:57)
years this is this is (38:55 - 39:00)
I the thing is (38:57 - 39:03)
what I again I think the overarching (39:00 - 39:05)
story where you go from start to finish (39:03 - 39:09)
is a very good story yes I I (39:05 - 39:13)
think the problem is is it takes (39:09 - 39:18)
you so long to get there and they drop (39:13 - 39:21)
so many things that they just have no (39:18 - 39:23)
interest in following up on along the (39:21 - 39:25)
way (39:23 - 39:30)
and from chap three on those chapters (39:25 - 39:35)
take so incredibly long to get through (39:30 - 39:38)
and then I had to deal with anime Trope (39:35 - 39:39)
we're staying behind and then we're (39:38 - 39:41)
coming back as villain I'm (39:39 - 39:46)
like stop it just cut cut to the Mewtwo (39:41 - 39:49)
Deoxys fight do the really cool Pikachu (39:46 - 39:52)
super Circle everything blows up and (39:49 - 39:53)
we're (39:52 - 39:57)
out edit edit edit edit edit it took way (39:53 - 39:59)
too long to get here I don't I don't (39:57 - 40:01)
care about finding the 17th code I don't (39:59 - 40:03)
need to find yet another key (40:01 - 40:07)
card what building sets up stairways in (40:03 - 40:11)
the most fire hazard way that has ever (40:07 - 40:14)
existed I'm like okay I found the (40:11 - 40:16)
stairway this will take me straight to (40:14 - 40:20)
five because that's how stairways (40:16 - 40:23)
work one of the coolest things they (40:20 - 40:26)
did is that they had like a Hannah did (40:23 - 40:28)
you finish the game I (40:26 - 40:33)
didn't spoiler Hannah it gets real bad (40:28 - 40:35)
it sounds like it doesn't get that bad (40:33 - 40:37)
uh one of the coolest things they did a (40:35 - 40:41)
million per super cool is you walk into (40:37 - 40:44)
a room with like a dying Whooper Whooper (40:41 - 40:46)
is literally on life support and you (40:44 - 40:49)
have to you you really obvious there's (40:46 - 40:53)
like a little watering um fountain or (40:49 - 40:55)
whatever you have to like go over get a (40:53 - 40:57)
cup of water come back you SA the (40:55 - 40:59)
Whooper and then in the Next Room (40:57 - 41:00)
there's an (40:59 - 41:02)
electrode and I was like you know what (41:00 - 41:04)
would be cool is like you need to bring (41:02 - 41:06)
the Whooper with you so the electrode (41:04 - 41:08)
doesn't explode and then they did that (41:06 - 41:11)
that was the puzzle like Whooper ability (41:08 - 41:14)
is damp so you the electrodes like M (41:11 - 41:15)
like you need to get into the room to (41:14 - 41:17)
get the key card but the electrodes like (41:15 - 41:19)
threatening to explode so once you (41:17 - 41:21)
rescue the Whooper you bring the Whooper (41:19 - 41:22)
in to (41:21 - 41:26)
prevent that is such a cool puzzle you (41:22 - 41:28)
even though it's like really simple cuz (41:26 - 41:32)
it's like but like in a Pokemon world (41:28 - 41:34)
that is the kind of puzzle you want oh (41:32 - 41:38)
yeah like like if they just had like (41:34 - 41:40)
five more of those puzzles like (41:38 - 41:42)
literally two of those puzzles in (41:40 - 41:44)
chapter 3 would have like been (41:42 - 41:47)
significant like cut everything add two (41:44 - 41:50)
Pokemon based puzzles you have a better (41:47 - 41:53)
chapter like chapter understand why (41:50 - 41:56)
Pikachu went to jail in chapter 3 I get (41:53 - 41:59)
it which is when you say that out loud I (41:56 - 42:01)
understand why Pikachu went to jail on (41:59 - 42:04)
paper that sounds awesome you're like a (42:01 - 42:07)
Pikachu is a Harden criminal like every (42:04 - 42:08)
chapter makes sense of what they're (42:07 - 42:10)
trying to (42:08 - 42:13)
say like yep but every chap just felt (42:10 - 42:17)
takes too long too long and was not (42:13 - 42:18)
unique (42:17 - 42:21)
enough so like that was my problem (42:18 - 42:23)
between chapter 3 and chapter 4 is I (42:21 - 42:26)
actually think chapter 4 was completely (42:23 - 42:30)
ruined by chapter 3 cuz they were very (42:26 - 42:32)
similar we need they were the same they (42:30 - 42:33)
were the same gimmick we need to break (42:32 - 42:40)
you apart yeah it was go back gimmick (42:33 - 42:40)
it it sets up the end of the game but (42:40 - 42:51)
not in a way that ultimately is all that (42:46 - 42:52)
interesting like they didn't focus on (42:51 - 42:54)
the more interesting aspect of the two (42:52 - 42:58)
characters meeting uh and then like (42:54 - 43:00)
again you're not arresting somebody at (42:58 - 43:02)
the end right like you don't get to send (43:00 - 43:04)
anybody to jail you're not solving a (43:02 - 43:07)
puzzle you're not (43:04 - 43:11)
really you're doing the thing that (43:07 - 43:14)
like you just expected to be the way the (43:11 - 43:17)
game was ending and again it again it (43:14 - 43:20)
was written in a way like who is this (43:17 - 43:23)
written for like we didn't need to do (43:20 - 43:25)
this deduction scene because you've been (43:23 - 43:30)
spilling it out for almost three hours (43:25 - 43:32)
now yeah (43:30 - 43:36)
I I think like Pikachu struggling with (43:32 - 43:37)
like melling the story was really (43:36 - 43:39)
interesting again I think I think (43:37 - 43:41)
chapter 4 was would have (43:39 - 43:45)
been better if it wasn't for chapter 3 I (43:41 - 43:46)
I (43:45 - 43:50)
just it just needed to happen (43:46 - 43:52)
faster more interestingly and a bunch of (43:50 - 43:55)
the fluff just completely cut cuz they (43:52 - 43:58)
weren't going to do do anything with it (43:55 - 44:01)
anyways um like they just don't do (43:58 - 44:04)
anything with any of the plot lines that (44:01 - 44:06)
are sort of on the sides even even the (44:04 - 44:11)
newspaper stuff is is very brief very (44:06 - 44:13)
sort of fill in the S the story more but (44:11 - 44:17)
they ultimately don't do anything with (44:13 - 44:19)
it and then the game sort of ends and (44:17 - 44:21)
you're (44:19 - 44:24)
like why does Pikachu sniff the ground (44:21 - 44:25)
after (44:24 - 44:28)
credits (44:25 - 44:30)
yeah why I I'm asking you I thought you (44:28 - 44:33)
would know no I had the same I have the (44:30 - 44:35)
same question what what was that weird (44:33 - 44:38)
cut scene at the end he like he he just (44:35 - 44:40)
like sniffs the (44:38 - 44:43)
ground following the (44:40 - 44:47)
trail don't know no it lit it the ending (44:43 - 44:51)
of that thing like everybody walks off (44:47 - 44:54)
screen you focus in on Pikachu Pikachu (44:51 - 44:56)
stiffs the ground and looks at the (44:54 - 44:57)
camera and then you're kind of done and (44:56 - 45:01)
I'm like what did I miss an important (44:57 - 45:05)
step in this is it hinting that he likes (45:01 - 45:08)
coffee still like I don't know what that (45:05 - 45:10)
means yeah I I don't know what that (45:08 - 45:12)
means I was I was the whole reason I (45:10 - 45:13)
wanted to spoil the end of the game is (45:12 - 45:15)
so I could ask you that legit question (45:13 - 45:18)
of why did he sniff the (45:15 - 45:18)
ground okay uh hold on we got we got to (45:18 - 45:24)
finish this news uh the bundle is coming (45:21 - 45:26)
on November 3rd there is a special (45:24 - 45:29)
pre-order bonus of 100 pokeballs this is (45:26 - 45:30)
not new this is something they've been (45:29 - 45:32)
doing since like black and white or (45:30 - 45:34)
whatever where you get 100 pokeballs if (45:32 - 45:38)
you pre-order it (45:34 - 45:38)
um the the Pokemon company is like a (45:39 - 45:44)
company that will (45:42 - 45:47)
like I I think most companies would like (45:44 - 45:50)
not like to admit that their games have (45:47 - 45:52)
gotten delayed or whatnot if they don't (45:50 - 45:55)
have to right so I think for a lot of (45:52 - 45:58)
Nintendo fans in (45:55 - 46:00)
general um they will be like look at (45:58 - 46:03)
Zelda Zelda was delayed what like three (46:00 - 46:07)
times um and that's okay we just want it (46:03 - 46:09)
to be the best game ever but there there (46:07 - 46:12)
are plenty of times where they'll say (46:09 - 46:14)
hey this game is coming out at the end (46:12 - 46:16)
of the year and then we don't know what (46:14 - 46:18)
that is and maybe in their internal (46:16 - 46:21)
system they wanted to get September but (46:18 - 46:22)
it ended up getting pushed to November (46:21 - 46:26)
or December right like we don't know uh (46:22 - 46:28)
I think think it is safe to say looking (46:26 - 46:32)
back that both brilliant diamond and (46:28 - 46:35)
Shining Pearl and legends were delayed (46:32 - 46:38)
but that that was never said like (46:35 - 46:40)
brilliant Diamond shining Pearl was (46:38 - 46:42)
probably supposed to come out on the (46:40 - 46:44)
15th anniversary of diamond and pearl (46:42 - 46:46)
which would have been like what like (46:44 - 46:48)
September 18th or something like that (46:46 - 46:53)
and it was pushed to the November game (46:48 - 46:57)
slot and legends came out in January (46:53 - 47:00)
and Legend should have came out before (46:57 - 47:02)
Thanksgiving mhm like that that was (47:00 - 47:04)
their bigger game and if you look at (47:02 - 47:06)
sales numbers like Legends did not do as (47:04 - 47:08)
good as brilliant Diamond shining Pearl (47:06 - 47:09)
even though (47:08 - 47:12)
like it's it's a better game it's a (47:09 - 47:15)
better it was also only one of it it was (47:12 - 47:17)
it was also only one but I bet if (47:15 - 47:19)
Legends would have came out before Black (47:17 - 47:21)
Friday it would have sold better hands (47:19 - 47:23)
down but before the holiday Before (47:21 - 47:26)
Christmas like if I I think of myself as (47:23 - 47:27)
a (47:26 - 47:28)
like as an adult obviously I'll just buy (47:27 - 47:30)
games whenever but I think of myself as (47:28 - 47:33)
like a even like a 14-year-old or or a (47:30 - 47:37)
15y old like without a job and like if a (47:33 - 47:40)
Pokemon game came out in January I gota (47:37 - 47:42)
wait till my birthday like Christmas is (47:40 - 47:44)
over I missed my I like I don't get it I (47:42 - 47:46)
got games twice a year birthday (47:44 - 47:48)
Christmas that's (47:46 - 47:52)
it until I started working a job (47:48 - 47:55)
um (47:52 - 47:57)
so (47:55 - 48:02)
I wonder if area zero or whatever the (47:57 - 48:04)
what's the second one called um Indigo (48:02 - 48:07)
disc Indigo disc I wonder if their (48:04 - 48:09)
actual game plan was for this game to (48:07 - 48:12)
come out November (48:09 - 48:16)
3rd or even a week sooner but that (48:12 - 48:17)
doesn't make any sense because then (48:16 - 48:19)
stores would be upset that like why are (48:17 - 48:21)
you releasing the DLC and then like no (48:19 - 48:23)
one's going to come in so like the (48:21 - 48:26)
reason I say that is because this go I (48:23 - 48:27)
don't know if we we talked about this on (48:26 - 48:29)
the podcast sometimes I I I rant on my (48:27 - 48:31)
twitch streams about this because (48:29 - 48:33)
there's still that the the longgo (48:31 - 48:34)
argument I'll make it real short the (48:33 - 48:37)
long-going argument of like why am when (48:34 - 48:39)
I get a digital game does it cost the (48:37 - 48:42)
same as the game at the (48:39 - 48:45)
store and how is that an argument well (48:42 - 48:47)
it's like well I'm not buying the case (48:45 - 48:49)
I'm not buying the CD I don't like I (48:47 - 48:51)
don't like I'm not buying the fact that (48:49 - 48:53)
like a bunch of these were packed up and (48:51 - 48:55)
shipped to the distributor but the the (48:53 - 48:57)
main reason they're the same (48:55 - 49:00)
price like both games are $60 is because (48:57 - 49:03)
the second the digital game is cheaper (49:00 - 49:05)
Target Walmart Best Buy they're like we (49:03 - 49:08)
don't want it then if we can't compete (49:05 - 49:10)
with it we don't want to waste the Shelf (49:08 - 49:16)
space yeah so you have to make the (49:10 - 49:20)
stores like willing to carry your game (49:16 - 49:24)
because their space on their floor is (49:20 - 49:27)
more valuable and if they sell the game (49:24 - 49:28)
then they're just wasting space where (49:27 - 49:31)
they could put more socks or ornaments (49:28 - 49:33)
or whatever else they want to put there (49:31 - 49:36)
Halloween candy you're right so that's (49:33 - 49:38)
why digital games and physical games are (49:36 - 49:41)
the same price but also let's be (49:38 - 49:45)
realistic that the case and the (49:41 - 49:49)
cartridge do not cost that much money (49:45 - 49:52)
like we are not talking a plastic case (49:49 - 49:55)
and a plastic hunk that has a circuit (49:52 - 49:57)
board in it are (49:55 - 50:00)
$50,000 at this point in our lives this (49:57 - 50:03)
stuff is cheap it is (50:00 - 50:08)
not they will willingly take the 50 Cent (50:03 - 50:11)
loss on a plastic case to get it in (50:08 - 50:13)
stores and sell it at the same price (50:11 - 50:17)
like this they're not made out of gold (50:13 - 50:20)
it's not that you know they got we got (50:17 - 50:22)
nothing but plastic around us this is (50:20 - 50:24)
not this is not a heartbreak for (50:22 - 50:27)
companies to put out a physical (50:24 - 50:27)
copy (50:30 - 50:37)
so deals like this deals like we're like (50:33 - 50:41)
we're getting our Nintendo Pokemon Sony (50:37 - 50:44)
Bethesda game on the store shelves is (50:41 - 50:47)
not something they just decide a week (50:44 - 50:50)
before right there's a marketing plan (50:47 - 50:53)
usually they have to make all these (50:50 - 50:55)
games they got to store them in a (50:53 - 50:58)
warehouse they got to then ship them on (50:55 - 51:01)
a boat or a plane and then move them (50:58 - 51:05)
into cars and trucks or trains and then (51:01 - 51:07)
they got to sit in another Warehouse to (51:05 - 51:09)
then get moved again to then sit in the (51:07 - 51:12)
back of Target's Warehouse like there's (51:09 - 51:13)
a lot going (51:12 - 51:16)
on that means this game should have been (51:13 - 51:20)
done by now yeah that's what this means (51:16 - 51:22)
so I I don't think anyone listening to (51:20 - 51:26)
this podcast doesn't think that um the (51:22 - 51:28)
Indigo disc wasn't supposed to launch (51:26 - 51:30)
before Black (51:28 - 51:33)
Friday and November 3rd seems like a (51:30 - 51:35)
good date since they're putting out the (51:33 - 51:39)
physical copies of that on November 3rd (51:35 - 51:42)
this weekend uh and it's not here but (51:39 - 51:45)
they never (51:42 - 51:48)
said that the here and this is why this (51:45 - 51:50)
is why I brought up um Diamond and Pearl (51:48 - 51:52)
and legends they never said those games (51:50 - 51:55)
were delayed they were though they never (51:52 - 52:00)
said said that um the teal mask and (51:55 - 52:04)
indigo disc were delayed they were yeah (52:00 - 52:09)
yeah yeah you're telling me a Summer (52:04 - 52:13)
Festival game is coming out in (52:09 - 52:17)
September not (52:13 - 52:17)
summer I mean we could have the argument (52:18 - 52:23)
that it's still technically some that's (52:21 - 52:27)
true that's true they yeah um we could (52:23 - 52:30)
we could have that argument uh we won't (52:27 - 52:32)
we'll leave that for (52:30 - 52:36)
Al um not that the quality got really (52:32 - 52:38)
that much better or at all better by (52:36 - 52:41)
delaying the first part um it's still (52:38 - 52:43)
locks up it's still frame rate they (52:41 - 52:47)
still had glitches obviously um (52:43 - 52:51)
but I don't expect like the graphics to (52:47 - 52:53)
get better when the Indigo disc drops I (52:51 - 52:54)
don't expect the frame rate to get (52:53 - 52:57)
better at this point I I expect it to be (52:54 - 52:59)
done at the Quality that the other two (52:57 - 53:03)
parts have done y that's where I'm at (52:59 - 53:06)
and then you know that's fine it's it's (53:03 - 53:09)
out most of you listening have probably (53:06 - 53:11)
already bought the the DLC for the first (53:09 - 53:14)
part the second part is part of that (53:11 - 53:16)
you're going to play it it's hopefully (53:14 - 53:19)
going to have something that is (53:16 - 53:21)
cool uh I think a lot of people liked (53:19 - 53:22)
Dynamax Adventures I think a lot of (53:21 - 53:25)
people liked hunting old legendaries and (53:22 - 53:28)
having old Pokemon return and we already (53:25 - 53:31)
saw online that people are very excited (53:28 - 53:33)
that a bunch of starter Pokemon are (53:31 - 53:37)
coming back so um there is some things (53:33 - 53:39)
to look forward (53:37 - 53:43)
to uh which is exciting (53:39 - 53:43)
but uh there's story to look forward to (53:44 - 53:50)
I'm excited about the story yeah there (53:47 - 53:52)
there's some story to look forward to (53:50 - 53:55)
the professor is maybe not dead I still (53:52 - 53:59)
think the professor's not dead (53:55 - 53:59)
for wait why why is this like a we (53:59 - 54:04)
weren't all in that boat of the (54:02 - 54:07)
professor not actually being dead nope (54:04 - 54:10)
not in that boat oh (54:07 - 54:13)
okay we'll see (54:10 - 54:13)
me I I can absolutely see (54:16 - 54:23)
them not having done something that (54:20 - 54:25)
drastic like I do think it is the way (54:23 - 54:27)
they left it in the absolute R of (54:25 - 54:31)
possibility that neither they they are (54:27 - 54:33)
as I thought when I first entered that (54:31 - 54:35)
area they aren't dead they are actually (54:33 - 54:38)
trapped I can see them leaning into them (54:35 - 54:40)
still being trapped and part of the (54:38 - 54:43)
thing is getting them out of whatever (54:40 - 54:45)
situation got them trapped in the first (54:43 - 54:47)
place however you want to talk about (54:45 - 54:50)
imagination Dimensions whatever (54:47 - 54:52)
whatever they're going to finally do (54:50 - 54:53)
with area zero fingers crossed that (54:52 - 54:56)
they're actually going to finally (54:53 - 54:58)
answer any of those questions I don't (54:56 - 55:01)
have a lot of hope that they will um but (54:58 - 55:05)
I hope I really hope that they do but uh (55:01 - 55:08)
yeah I mean at this point it is a coin (55:05 - 55:11)
toss whether they stay or pull away like (55:08 - 55:14)
I can see both sides of it that they'll (55:11 - 55:16)
leave them dead or they'll be like nope (55:14 - 55:17)
they were trapped and you saved it and (55:16 - 55:20)
it's a happy ending like both I think (55:17 - 55:22)
are 100% possible for whatever they're (55:20 - 55:24)
going to do with these (55:22 - 55:27)
games Pikachu jumps in front of Kieran (55:24 - 55:31)
sniffs the ground yeah I mean (55:27 - 55:34)
so here's the thing the only reason why (55:31 - 55:38)
they sniff the ground is to suggest that (55:34 - 55:41)
Pikachu is still possibly like I (55:38 - 55:43)
understand how detectiving Works which (55:41 - 55:46)
is like you got that from the flashback (55:43 - 55:48)
so it was like just once again sort of (55:46 - 55:49)
underlying that Pikachu could still be a (55:48 - 55:51)
detective but just can't (55:49 - 55:55)
talk I don't know it's it's an ambiguous (55:51 - 55:58)
way to end that that long game without (55:55 - 56:01)
sort of giving any answers like I think (55:58 - 56:03)
there's a slight I think it is their (56:01 - 56:06)
slight opening to say we'll do a three (56:03 - 56:07)
and please don't do a (56:06 - 56:11)
three do a three only if every episode (56:07 - 56:14)
of Scooby-Doo (56:11 - 56:14)
yes but please don't do a three but what (56:15 - 56:20)
if they introduce like a Pichu and (56:18 - 56:24)
pichu's Scrappy Doo then absolutely (56:20 - 56:26)
don't do a three (56:24 - 56:30)
absolutely do not do a three no no do (56:26 - 56:33)
not cut it I don't know that sounds that (56:30 - 56:34)
sounds (56:33 - 56:36)
better Scrappy D might be the worst (56:34 - 56:39)
cartoon character of all (56:36 - 56:43)
time Fair yall didn't live yall did live (56:39 - 56:45)
through the cousin Oliver end times like (56:43 - 56:48)
we had to (56:45 - 56:52)
um yeah I mean (56:48 - 56:54)
uh I don't know who well I was going to (56:52 - 56:55)
say I don't know who's is picking up a (56:54 - 56:58)
double pack of area zero I do know who (56:55 - 57:01)
parents parents who (56:58 - 57:04)
are parents and or collectors and as (57:01 - 57:06)
somebody who is a collector it this one (57:04 - 57:10)
feels weird because the whole game isn't (57:06 - 57:13)
on there yeah this one's weird this is (57:10 - 57:14)
this one (57:13 - 57:19)
is weird that they aren't including both (57:14 - 57:21)
like it's a choice it's like it's like (57:19 - 57:24)
buying Ultras Sun Ultra moon but it's (57:21 - 57:27)
actually just Moon and you got like (57:24 - 57:29)
update we'll update it (57:27 - 57:32)
after I (57:29 - 57:32)
just like ah I finally added Bev to my (57:33 - 57:41)
game I (57:38 - 57:41)
mean the chances that the Indigo disc (57:41 - 57:46)
are coming out in November I with this (57:44 - 57:49)
release I think are off the table really (57:46 - 57:52)
I do think that is like uh no well again (57:49 - 57:54)
I just think they they they only have (57:52 - 57:55)
two Fridays to pick (57:54 - 57:58)
yeah they have the 10th and the 17th and (57:55 - 58:01)
unless there's a announcement this week (57:58 - 58:04)
I I there could be there could be (58:01 - 58:06)
definitely an announcement this (58:04 - 58:08)
week I mean I wouldn't be surprised if (58:06 - 58:11)
it was January at this point well they (58:08 - 58:15)
do say winter of 2023 so they are the (58:11 - 58:17)
winter it's the 2023 they are going to (58:15 - 58:20)
do at least the last week of December (58:17 - 58:23)
2023 to get it under their promised (58:20 - 58:25)
date that is one thing they are good (58:23 - 58:28)
about is when they announce a year by (58:25 - 58:29)
Heaven they're getting it in on that (58:28 - 58:31)
year yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't I (58:29 - 58:34)
think it's for sure this year um like (58:31 - 58:36)
they didn't (58:34 - 58:39)
say early 20 like when they were spot on (58:36 - 58:41)
with Legends and we questioned that for (58:39 - 58:46)
a long time of like early 2023 what do (58:41 - 58:48)
you oh you're actually doing January (58:46 - 58:50)
that's weird why don't you take like (58:48 - 58:52)
your game looks very muddy why don't you (58:50 - 58:53)
take a little bit more time they were (58:52 - 58:56)
like nope they they stuck to that (58:53 - 58:59)
it (58:56 - 58:59)
it's I'm just thinking about how late (59:00 - 59:05)
the teal mask was probably delayed (59:03 - 59:08)
thinking about it may have tried they (59:05 - 59:10)
may have intended to release it in early (59:08 - 59:12)
summer maybe (59:10 - 59:15)
June and then came July would be my (59:12 - 59:17)
guess I feel like it's a late June early (59:15 - 59:20)
July and then it came out multiple (59:17 - 59:23)
months after that yeah so I mean (59:20 - 59:25)
intended to release it (59:23 - 59:28)
the part two in (59:25 - 59:32)
November or late October or late October (59:28 - 59:33)
because I have a feeling they wanted it (59:32 - 59:36)
to be out a couple weeks before they (59:33 - 59:40)
would have released the double pack to (59:36 - 59:42)
be like get the hype up and then hype it (59:40 - 59:44)
up for when the double pack came out (59:42 - 59:47)
with the too areas on it which means it (59:44 - 59:50)
would have been probably released normal (59:47 - 59:51)
time (59:50 - 59:55)
like last week or maybe this week um and (59:51 - 59:58)
they didn't they didn't hit it so I have (59:55 - 60:01)
a strong feeling this is I have a strong (59:58 - 60:04)
feeling this is now a mid (60:01 - 60:07)
December Before Christmas thing like (60:04 - 60:09)
they want to hit it at the early part of (60:07 - 60:12)
December to build up hype while parents (60:09 - 60:16)
are buying gifts for their (60:12 - 60:16)
kids I yeah I mean I'm just I has there (60:18 - 60:24)
ever has there ever been a Nintendo game (60:22 - 60:25)
that came out (60:24 - 60:28)
on Black Friday I don't think so it's (60:25 - 60:30)
always been the week (60:28 - 60:33)
before um like Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire (60:30 - 60:37)
Super Smash Brothers Wii U like I I (60:33 - 60:39)
remember they came out on the same day (60:37 - 60:42)
but that was that was like a week or two (60:39 - 60:44)
before Black (60:42 - 60:47)
Friday Ultra Sun Ultra moon was also (60:44 - 60:49)
like two weeks before Black Friday let's (60:47 - 60:51)
go Pikachu let's go Eevee was before (60:49 - 60:55)
Black Friday yeah I generally I don't I (60:51 - 60:59)
can't think of any I can't think of any (60:55 - 61:01)
just game that like games that are (60:59 - 61:04)
actually released on Black Friday like I (61:01 - 61:06)
there are deals on Black Friday but I (61:04 - 61:08)
can't think of (61:06 - 61:11)
actual also Friday's not a big release (61:08 - 61:15)
date around the holidays (61:11 - 61:17)
anyways Call of Duty is usually before (61:15 - 61:20)
Black Friday (61:17 - 61:20)
yeah I'm I I cannot I (61:22 - 61:27)
course then again the other problem of (61:25 - 61:30)
releasing a game on Black Friday is your (61:27 - 61:32)
announcement will be swamped by the (61:30 - 61:33)
bargains and (61:32 - 61:37)
Deals so it's not like a great time to (61:33 - 61:39)
do that anyways to be like hey we're (61:37 - 61:41)
releasing this game on Black Friday but (61:39 - 61:42)
you don't care because you're looking at (61:41 - 61:45)
what's on sale right right it's like (61:42 - 61:48)
well these games are $20 this game is 60 (61:45 - 61:50)
yeah like you're just not but the reason (61:48 - 61:53)

um I take it back they're going to (69:13 - 69:18)
release uh the DLC on November 10th (69:15 - 69:20)
because they always put everything on (69:18 - 69:23)
the same (69:20 - 69:23)
weekend (69:23 - 69:26)
uh they didn't say What Pokemon do we (69:26 - 69:31)
know what Pokemon is this raid day I (69:29 - 69:33)
think so lots of things have leaked all (69:31 - 69:36)
the way up through January so I'm (69:33 - 69:37)
starting to get it (69:36 - 69:39)
confused uh okay what what what are what (69:37 - 69:41)
are people saying should I be excited (69:39 - 69:43)
for November 11th should I take that day (69:41 - 69:46)
off is it just Lugia and (69:43 - 69:50)
ho don't remember let's (69:46 - 69:52)
see what in (69:50 - 69:58)
doubt just H honestly yeah um but it (69:52 - 70:00)
looks (69:58 - 70:00)
like raid day I forget whether that (70:01 - 70:08)
might be the Garchomp mega mega Garchomp (70:04 - 70:09)
raid (70:08 - 70:12)
day I guess Gom is popular enough to (70:09 - 70:14)
have its own day also the mega Garchomp (70:12 - 70:18)
is weirdly an amazing shiny yeah Gom on (70:14 - 70:20)
its own is not it's like they did the (70:18 - 70:22)
same thing with Gengar they made Mega (70:20 - 70:25)
Gengar super good (70:22 - 70:27)
but yes that one is coming out in on on (70:25 - 70:29)
a raid day only and I think that might (70:27 - 70:31)
be (70:29 - 70:31)
it uh I guess that would make sense uh I (70:31 - 70:37)
didn't hear that but I guess garum is (70:34 - 70:39)
very (70:37 - 70:42)
popular um (70:39 - 70:46)
so that's that's cool I guess um it's (70:42 - 70:49)
super cool that like India gets (70:46 - 70:51)
something I feel like there's always (70:49 - 70:57)
like Brazil India uh um (70:51 - 70:59)
China well they got their own problems (70:57 - 71:01)
there but (70:59 - 71:04)
yeah usually when like like you think of (71:01 - 71:06)
events it's always like oh all the (71:04 - 71:09)
events are usually in Japan or America (71:06 - 71:12)
they're starting to have others yeah so (71:09 - 71:14)
the Festival of Lights the deali (71:12 - 71:16)
celebration was around before I'm (71:14 - 71:18)
excited that the glowing effect is (71:16 - 71:19)
coming back for Pokemon at night time (71:18 - 71:21)
that was the thing they did I think last (71:19 - 71:23)
year when they introduced it maybe two (71:21 - 71:24)
years ago (71:23 - 71:26)
where some of these Pokémon will (71:24 - 71:29)
actually sort of glow and light up at (71:26 - 71:31)
night time and also right before the (71:29 - 71:33)
Festival of Lights they have the dios (71:31 - 71:35)
event happening again where they're (71:33 - 71:37)
adding more of the flower crowns that I (71:35 - 71:39)
can't pronounce no matter how hard I try (71:37 - 71:41)
to the Cubone (71:39 - 71:43)
line I can pronounce them just fine (71:41 - 71:46)
Hannah come on oh go for it I'm excited (71:43 - 71:49)
how do you pronounce it (71:46 - 71:51)
Steve I don't have them in front of me (71:49 - 71:54)
oh but look them up we got time we're in (71:51 - 71:56)
the second half we can go yeah we got we (71:54 - 72:01)
got play oh here we go here we go uh um (71:56 - 72:06)
uh uh Cubone and Marowak are wearing the (72:01 - 72:07)
uh (72:06 - 72:09)
Shas (72:07 - 72:12)
crowns yeah that was probably (72:09 - 72:14)
spoton (72:12 - 72:15)
[Laughter] (72:14 - 72:18)
[Music] (72:15 - 72:18)
no Japanese and Spanish use the same (72:21 - 72:26)
speak Spanish I speak French Japanese (72:24 - 72:28)
and Spanish use the same vows so it's (72:26 - 72:30)
something like (72:28 - 72:32)
sea but that's probably not right (72:30 - 72:35)
because there's an (72:32 - 72:39)
accented V in there I don't for sure (72:35 - 72:40)
yeah I don't I they didn't teach me that (72:39 - 72:42)
in uh Milwaukee Public Schools they (72:40 - 72:46)
didn't teach me the accent uh (72:42 - 72:50)
U not sure what that's doing (72:46 - 72:53)
um yes that event actually we actually (72:50 - 72:55)
we didn't even talk about that event so (72:53 - 72:58)
the uh that will start with the Cubone (72:55 - 73:00)
and the Marowak with the flower crown (72:58 - 73:01)
that will start um it's only two days (73:00 - 73:05)
it's uh November 1st through November (73:01 - 73:09)
2nd 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. lurs will (73:05 - 73:12)
last 90 minutes uh incense will last 90 (73:09 - 73:16)
minutes Twice The Catch candy additional (73:12 - 73:17)
transfer (73:16 - 73:20)
candy uh and then DUS skull is making (73:17 - 73:22)
its return with the (73:20 - 73:26)
crown uh um Cubone makes its debut with (73:22 - 73:28)
the crown Roselia is featured in this (73:26 - 73:29)
event (73:28 - 73:32)
Greg I it's only one day though so two (73:29 - 73:36)
days it's two days technically two days (73:32 - 73:39)
um do we know (73:36 - 73:42)
if well I'm assuming you'll be able to (73:39 - 73:44)
evolve the DUS skull again because the (73:42 - 73:47)
picture shows dusk Noir but there was (73:44 - 73:49)
like something where the event was over (73:47 - 73:51)
you weren't able to evolve the DUS (73:49 - 73:52)
wearing the flower crown you could only (73:51 - 73:54)
evolve it during the (73:52 - 73:58)
event I don't know if they fixed (73:54 - 74:01)
that n fix something who slow down (73:58 - 74:03)
sometimes they fix things like (74:01 - 74:06)
that well wait a minute and also the (74:03 - 74:09)
additional transfer candy is only for (74:06 - 74:12)
trainers in Latin America and the (74:09 - 74:14)
Caribbean oh yeah you're right you're (74:12 - 74:16)
right you're right it looks like I can (74:14 - 74:18)
evolve those just call now so I'm pretty (74:16 - 74:20)
sure they fixed it okay okay okay okay I (74:18 - 74:22)
mean that's like not the worst thing to (74:20 - 74:24)
be like you can only this during the (74:22 - 74:27)
special event that's like I get it kind (74:24 - 74:28)
of weird (74:27 - 74:30)
but (74:28 - 74:33)
um okay the other thing I wanted to (74:30 - 74:35)
bring up we didn't talk about was the (74:33 - 74:36)
party (74:35 - 74:39)
play did uh did you did you party play (74:36 - 74:42)
Hannah I did with someone who hadn't (74:39 - 74:44)
played Pokemon go in years all right (74:42 - 74:46)
tell us about it tell us about the party (74:44 - 74:48)
play also maybe for people who don't (74:46 - 74:51)
know what party play is yes so party (74:48 - 74:52)
play is a new feature where you can (74:51 - 74:55)
connect with friends in person and you (74:52 - 74:58)
can see them on your map and you can go (74:55 - 75:00)
after different challenges where you are (74:58 - 75:02)
kind of catching a certain number of (75:00 - 75:04)
Pokemon or getting a certain number of (75:02 - 75:06)
great or excellent throws winning a (75:04 - 75:08)
certain number of raids just reaching (75:06 - 75:10)
that goal with the other people in your (75:08 - 75:12)
party you can have up to four people in (75:10 - 75:13)
your (75:12 - 75:16)
party what I really like is that if you (75:13 - 75:18)
both say yes to sharing your location (75:16 - 75:20)
and seeing each other on the map when (75:18 - 75:23)
you walk away the trainer actually walks (75:20 - 75:26)
away from the other person on the map so (75:23 - 75:28)
it's actually the location it's not just (75:26 - 75:30)
everyone gathered around your player in (75:28 - 75:34)
game I had uh this was while my ankle (75:30 - 75:35)
was still healing so I had my friend (75:34 - 75:38)
stay where she was and I walked a block (75:35 - 75:41)
away and it took a minute but eventually (75:38 - 75:42)
the trainers started walking away from (75:41 - 75:44)
each other that was something I wasn't (75:42 - 75:47)
sure it was actually going to do um it's (75:44 - 75:50)
fun there aren't great (75:47 - 75:54)
rewards uh and it takes a long time (75:50 - 75:57)
to finish almost any of the challenges I (75:54 - 76:01)
want to say some of them go quicker but (75:57 - 76:04)
uh if you're trying to finish the (76:01 - 76:06)
research for the challenges and get all (76:04 - 76:10)
the those eveve Luan shirts it's a lot (76:06 - 76:12)
I'm not sure when I'm going to finish (76:10 - 76:15)
that uh Party play challenge the most (76:12 - 76:18)
exciting part of it for me was running (76:15 - 76:20)
up against the clock at the end because (76:18 - 76:22)
you have no idea when the party play is (76:20 - 76:24)
going to end once you get close to the (76:22 - 76:27)
end of the hour because the party only (76:24 - 76:30)
lasts 1 hour it gives you a warning at I (76:27 - 76:32)
think 10 minutes and so you know that (76:30 - 76:35)
you have 10 minutes left you kind of (76:32 - 76:37)
want to finish the challenge you're (76:35 - 76:39)
working on before that 10 minutes my (76:37 - 76:42)
friend and I had chosen the catch 30 (76:39 - 76:44)
different Pokemon (76:42 - 76:48)
in or before the challenge ended and (76:44 - 76:49)
it's the Halloween event so the spawns (76:48 - 76:51)
are pretty (76:49 - 76:55)
limited we were at 20 ate Pokémon I was (76:51 - 76:56)
trying to figure out where the heck we (76:55 - 76:58)
were going to get the last two Pokémon (76:56 - 77:00)
from there was one raid so I could get a (76:58 - 77:03)
Meowth and make that 29 and so while I (77:00 - 77:05)
was working on that one raid I was (77:03 - 77:07)
instructing my friend on how to force (77:05 - 77:08)
spawn a (77:07 - 77:11)
smeargle and catch a smeargle before the (77:08 - 77:17)
end of the hour um so that part was fun (77:11 - 77:18)
it would have been nice if we could have (77:17 - 77:20)
seen the countdown though I'm hoping (77:18 - 77:24)
they actually add a timer or an (77:20 - 77:26)
extension to the time of the Party play (77:24 - 77:29)
because not knowing exactly when the (77:26 - 77:32)
party is going to end makes it hard to (77:29 - 77:33)
do those challenges right at the end of (77:32 - 77:36)
the (77:33 - 77:36)
hour uh yeah I I have like on the (77:36 - 77:46)
Vaporeon shirt which is the second one (77:42 - 77:47)
uh I like Party play I actually think (77:46 - 77:51)
it's a really cool feature I think (77:47 - 77:55)
that if you play Pokemon frequently with (77:51 - 77:59)
somebody it just makes sense oh yeah um (77:55 - 78:02)
and it's just an extra thing that you (77:59 - 78:05)
can do that being said the rewards are (78:02 - 78:07)
terrible they're they're there it's like (78:05 - 78:10)
catch 30 Pokemon with nice throws for (78:07 - 78:13)
like two raspberries mhm so I'm not sure (78:10 - 78:17)
what Niantic is thinking reward wise for (78:13 - 78:18)
that (78:17 - 78:20)
because (78:18 - 78:24)
um the like none of none of the rewards (78:20 - 78:27)
are are good uh even like win two raids (78:24 - 78:30)
hatch three eggs walk 5 kilomet none of (78:27 - 78:31)
none of the rewards for any of that (78:30 - 78:34)
stuff is good I know I saw some people (78:31 - 78:37)
be like (78:34 - 78:40)
um why is it only an (78:37 - 78:42)
hour but my question is why do you want (78:40 - 78:45)
it longer like like if I when when we (78:42 - 78:47)
when I finish a challenge with a friend (78:45 - 78:51)
and it's like get 30 Excellence walk 3 (78:47 - 78:53)
km do two raids uh we're we're (78:51 - 78:55)
disbanding the party and then we're (78:53 - 78:57)
recreating it and we're getting (78:55 - 78:59)
different challenges like we're not (78:57 - 79:02)
doing like I I'm not walking 5 (78:59 - 79:04)
kilometers in Mall of America also there (79:02 - 79:06)
are no raids right now so we can't do (79:04 - 79:09)
that also you're bad at excellent throws (79:06 - 79:11)
so I am not going to sit here and try to (79:09 - 79:13)
30 excellent throws myself we're we're (79:11 - 79:15)
we're (79:13 - 79:19)
like I I don't know why there's an hour (79:15 - 79:22)
time limit it seems like somebody just (79:19 - 79:23)
sat in a room and was like we should put (79:22 - 79:25)
a time limit on this what should it be (79:23 - 79:27)
uh 60 Minutes it feels like the same (79:25 - 79:29)
it's like it's the same time limit when (79:27 - 79:32)
you have to reset your go device like (79:29 - 79:33)
they just picked an hour and they've (79:32 - 79:35)
stuck with an hour an hour like no Rhyme (79:33 - 79:37)
or Reason like hey it's going to be an (79:35 - 79:40)
hour and that's that is our time but (79:37 - 79:44)
there there's no reason to continue it (79:40 - 79:46)
that I guess that's like my push back of (79:44 - 79:47)
like the people that are like well it (79:46 - 79:49)
should be longer than an hour why it (79:47 - 79:51)
doesn't it doesn't give you better (79:49 - 79:53)
rewards the more you do it doesn't it (79:51 - 79:57)
doesn't get harder like if anything like (79:53 - 79:59)
if it did get harder and the rewards got (79:57 - 80:02)
better then yes I understand but like (79:59 - 80:04)
there's no penalty for being like Oh all (80:02 - 80:07)
all these challenges are not good so I'm (80:04 - 80:08)
just going to start I'm just going to (80:07 - 80:11)
quit restart go again cuz like right now (80:08 - 80:14)
the only incentive you have is complete (80:11 - 80:17)
a 100 Party play challenges to get all (80:14 - 80:20)
four shirts that's cool like the if you (80:17 - 80:24)
like Eevee that that's cool (80:20 - 80:26)
um but if you're trying to get through (80:24 - 80:30)
100 as quick as possible walking 5 km is (80:26 - 80:32)
not as quick as possible like catching (80:30 - 80:33)
20 Pokemon with nice throws is (80:32 - 80:35)
significantly easier especially if (80:33 - 80:38)
there's two or three of you so like in (80:35 - 80:41)
my head we're just okay out of these (80:38 - 80:43)
three what is the easiest great okay the (80:41 - 80:45)
next three all of these are bad quit the (80:43 - 80:49)
party restart the party let's go again (80:45 - 80:52)
um and again that doesn't mean like the (80:49 - 80:54)
concept of the feature Fe is bad I think (80:52 - 80:56)
the concept of getting together and (80:54 - 80:58)
having this overall goal while you're (80:56 - 81:01)
playing is really (80:58 - 81:05)
cool but it feels (81:01 - 81:08)
very conservative in the sense of like (81:05 - 81:10)
we want this we don't want this to be (81:08 - 81:12)
too powerful we want this to be safe we (81:10 - 81:14)
don't want people to feel stressed out (81:12 - 81:17)
but the rewards aren't that good like I (81:14 - 81:19)
don't there there is something really (81:17 - 81:23)
cool here and I think Niantic purposely (81:19 - 81:26)
made it very dull because they they're (81:23 - 81:30)
still trying to figure out mhm how I (81:26 - 81:32)
like I I literally think they're testing (81:30 - 81:34)
to see like how fast can people do the (81:32 - 81:36)
challenges which challenges are people (81:34 - 81:38)
doing how long are actually people (81:36 - 81:41)
staying in a session are people quitting (81:38 - 81:44)
the session like me to force new Rolls I (81:41 - 81:46)
think we're literally just beta testing (81:44 - 81:48)
this I don't think Niantic actually (81:46 - 81:53)
knows what the rewards should be which (81:48 - 81:56)
is fine uh like Mega's launched and that (81:53 - 82:00)
was just bad but this like but that was (81:56 - 82:02)
bad because it was asking for money and (82:00 - 82:05)
it was asking for time and this is like (82:02 - 82:06)
you're playing Pokemon like it's not (82:05 - 82:08)
asking you to do something you're not (82:06 - 82:11)
already doing so like (82:08 - 82:13)
they I'm just curious of what this looks (82:11 - 82:15)
like in six months cuz I think the (82:13 - 82:18)
foundation is good (82:15 - 82:21)
mhm I hope they do keep building on it (82:18 - 82:25)
it seems like since uh they gave that (82:21 - 82:27)
interview earlier in the year they have (82:25 - 82:28)
been kind of trying to introduce new (82:27 - 82:30)
feature after new feature after new (82:28 - 82:32)
feature and this is the one that seems (82:30 - 82:35)
the most polished but it still doesn't (82:32 - 82:38)
feel done and it's also still buggy in a (82:35 - 82:39)
couple ways I don't know if those have (82:38 - 82:41)
been fixed there are some people whose (82:39 - 82:44)
battle teams or saved tags have been (82:41 - 82:47)
have been getting completely erased just (82:44 - 82:49)
by being in a party that really scared (82:47 - 82:53)
me when I heard that I used tags a lot (82:49 - 82:56)
but it does feel a lot more (82:53 - 82:58)
polished this feels like a core feature (82:56 - 83:01)
of the game almost it was cool like when (82:58 - 83:04)
I was in a party um seeing each other in (83:01 - 83:06)
the map was really cool and then we (83:04 - 83:07)
decided to like coordinate outfits and (83:06 - 83:10)
that was like cool to see and um I (83:07 - 83:13)
tested how far I could walk away and I (83:10 - 83:15)
got a pretty much like a mile away (83:13 - 83:17)
before it was like you can't do this (83:15 - 83:20)
anymore wow um and then it was like hey (83:17 - 83:21)
you're too far and then it was like (83:20 - 83:23)
we're going to kick you and then I (83:21 - 83:24)
walked a little bit closer and it was (83:23 - 83:26)
like fine and then I was like okay can I (83:24 - 83:28)
push past the mile and it eventually was (83:26 - 83:30)
like you're too far away and kicked I (83:28 - 83:32)
wonder how it would be to gather a group (83:30 - 83:34)
of four friends together just in the (83:32 - 83:37)
middle of kind of a not too busy area (83:34 - 83:39)
but with plenty of Poké stops and just (83:37 - 83:40)
have everybody go in a different (83:39 - 83:44)
direction and see people on the map yeah (83:40 - 83:46)
I I would I'm I'm sure somebody has (83:44 - 83:48)
tried (83:46 - 83:52)
that yeah so I I I think it's I think (83:48 - 83:54)
it's really cool I I would be it would (83:52 - 83:57)
be cool if like on Community Days it (83:54 - 83:58)
they they would have Community Day (83:57 - 84:02)
specific challenges like um let's just (83:58 - 84:04)
say it was like Squirtle and it was like (84:02 - 84:06)
catch 30 Squirtle and then your (84:04 - 84:09)
encounter is the glasses Squirtle and (84:06 - 84:10)
not a regular (84:09 - 84:12)
Squirtle um like stuff like that would (84:10 - 84:14)
be really cool (84:12 - 84:17)
or maybe if the challenges did get (84:14 - 84:19)
harder the longer you were in a session (84:17 - 84:22)
they could start giving incubators or (84:19 - 84:24)
Star pieces or incense or something (84:22 - 84:26)
that's asking a lot from Niantic cuz you (84:24 - 84:28)
know they like to nickel and dime you (84:26 - 84:30)
but there's not again going back to my (84:28 - 84:31)
previous Point there's not a reason to (84:30 - 84:34)
stay the full hour like nothing (84:31 - 84:36)
changes um like your your rewards don't (84:34 - 84:40)
get better there the time liit keep the (84:36 - 84:42)
time limit then making the rewards (84:40 - 84:43)
better as you get further on would make (84:42 - 84:45)
sense (84:43 - 84:48)
mhm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the (84:45 - 84:51)
time limit would only make yeah (84:48 - 84:54)
um (84:51 - 84:57)
but my my I guess my only like the only (84:54 - 84:59)
reason the time limit somewhat makes (84:57 - 85:03)
sense is if you were at a community (84:59 - 85:05)
day (85:03 - 85:08)
and you actually met new people to play (85:05 - 85:12)
with and you partied up and you went (85:08 - 85:15)
separate ways and maybe it was like (85:12 - 85:17)
local so you like lived in the (85:15 - 85:20)
neighborhood of the park and so like you (85:17 - 85:23)
forgot to cuz you can turn your off and (85:20 - 85:24)
put in your pocket and the party still (85:23 - 85:27)
stays mhm um like my when I was walking (85:24 - 85:30)
a mile away like I was technically (85:27 - 85:32)
driving but when I was like driving and (85:30 - 85:33)
I was like a mile away and I like (85:32 - 85:36)
checked my phone I I was like oh are we (85:33 - 85:38)
still connected oh like I'm still (85:36 - 85:41)
connected um the only thing that I think (85:38 - 85:43)
of is it's just like a security (85:41 - 85:45)
precaution of like we're forcing the (85:43 - 85:49)
session so the people you met at (85:45 - 85:51)
Community who didn't forget to (85:49 - 85:52)
disconnect and you didn't forget to (85:51 - 85:54)
disconnect now can look at the map and (85:52 - 85:57)
be like oh they live here yeah that (85:54 - 85:58)
makes (85:57 - 86:00)
sense I think the one other thing I (85:58 - 86:03)
would ask for with this feature is that (86:00 - 86:07)
on the screen you go to to start a party (86:03 - 86:09)
I want to see my previous parties there (86:07 - 86:11)
I want to be able to go and look back (86:09 - 86:15)
and compare how many challenges I (86:11 - 86:18)
completed between the different parties (86:15 - 86:20)
that wouldn't work for you Steve since (86:18 - 86:22)
you are ending a party every time you (86:20 - 86:24)
complete challeng it sounds sometimes if (86:22 - 86:26)
they're easy if they're easy I'll keep (86:24 - 86:29)
going but I want to be able to see I (86:26 - 86:30)
want to be able to compare and I want to (86:29 - 86:33)
be able to think about that but right (86:30 - 86:35)
now it's just kind of the most blank (86:33 - 86:37)
screen you will ever see anywhere in (86:35 - 86:40)
Pokémon go also like I don't know how (86:37 - 86:42)
Niantic did it but like joining a party (86:40 - 86:45)
is like super easy like I feel like yeah (86:42 - 86:48)
this is smooth yeah it like joins like (86:45 - 86:50)
I've never had any problem joining it (86:48 - 86:52)
like and there's no lag when anyone is (86:50 - 86:54)
catching anything thing the challenges (86:52 - 86:57)
just stay up to date (86:54 - 87:01)
immediately yeah um I think there's so (86:57 - 87:04)
much potential here but it's (87:01 - 87:07)
Niantic so I I also wouldn't be (87:04 - 87:10)
surprised if in a year we're just like (87:07 - 87:11)
yeah you walk five kilometers you get (87:10 - 87:16)
two raspberries yeah (87:11 - 87:16)
yeah but like I I I I think I think this (87:16 - 87:24)
is cool and I I hope hope that whatever (87:20 - 87:26)
data they're grabbing from the last two (87:24 - 87:30)
weeks that's been out they can (87:26 - 87:34)
say here is a new party like here's a 30 (87:30 - 87:36)
minute session here's a on hour session (87:34 - 87:39)
here's a two-hour session the things get (87:36 - 87:41)
harder or the rewards are up there or (87:39 - 87:42)
the two hours is a lot harder than the (87:41 - 87:46)
30 minutes um I I do hope that there's (87:42 - 87:48)
something that they can do with it also (87:46 - 87:51)
we didn't even talk about this being in (87:48 - 87:53)
a party (87:51 - 87:57)
is so worth it for in-person raids ah (87:53 - 88:00)
yeah there is that the the party blast (87:57 - 88:03)
or whatever it's called is so (88:00 - 88:05)
powerful (88:03 - 88:08)
uh Craig's like what are you talking so (88:05 - 88:10)
party (88:08 - 88:13)
I is it actually called party blast or (88:10 - 88:17)
is that a thing that you're no I sure (88:13 - 88:20)
it's called I think it is called party (88:17 - 88:24)
blast um so when you're when you're in a (88:20 - 88:26)
raid um this doesn't work for remote (88:24 - 88:28)
raids so like if you're in a party and (88:26 - 88:30)
your party friend gets invited to a (88:28 - 88:33)
remote raid you don't know that that's (88:30 - 88:36)
happening but if your party friend joins (88:33 - 88:39)
a raid locally it will automatically (88:36 - 88:41)
send you an invite and say like oh so (88:39 - 88:43)
and so is in the raid would you like to (88:41 - 88:46)
join um and then you can join it that (88:43 - 88:48)
doesn't waste your like five invites or (88:46 - 88:51)
whatever so you can still do your five (88:48 - 88:54)
invites so when you're locally in a raid (88:51 - 88:56)
with somebody in a party in the lower (88:54 - 88:58)
leftand corner there's a there's your (88:56 - 89:02)
party blast button it called party power (88:58 - 89:04)
oh party power party blast sounds way (89:02 - 89:06)
cool Niantic I know you listen to the (89:04 - 89:09)
show rename it to party blast that (89:06 - 89:13)
sounds awesome (89:09 - 89:15)
uh Greg is if you're watching the (89:13 - 89:17)
YouTube if you're listening to the audio (89:15 - 89:20)
version Greg's face is very sold on (89:17 - 89:26)
this no blast is a terrible terrible the (89:20 - 89:28)
connotations of that just really think (89:26 - 89:29)
through (89:28 - 89:33)
that just after the show take take some (89:29 - 89:36)
time to just really think about what (89:33 - 89:39)
you've been saying for the last 10 (89:36 - 89:43)
minutes just really take a (89:39 - 89:43)
moment I think it sounds great again I (89:44 - 89:50)
just take some time post show to sit (89:47 - 89:52)
down with those thoughts and examine we (89:50 - 89:54)
got back to the end of the show (89:52 - 89:58)
um I think I know how it works now uh I (89:54 - 90:00)
think it's based off your fast move so (89:58 - 90:02)
if you have a Pokemon with it's it's (90:00 - 90:04)
just like GBL if you just have a Pokemon (90:02 - 90:06)
with a really fast move the party meter (90:04 - 90:08)
fills up way quicker versus a Pokemon (90:06 - 90:11)
that doesn't uh cuz I was like why why (90:08 - 90:13)
is my friend getting their party power (90:11 - 90:16)
way quicker than me um maybe it's (90:13 - 90:17)
because I'm higher level or they're (90:16 - 90:20)
using like lower CP Pokemon uh they were (90:17 - 90:23)
just using Pokemon that had like f moves (90:20 - 90:25)
it fills it up quicker it says on the (90:23 - 90:28)
blog post that more party members means (90:25 - 90:30)
that it charges the party power faster (90:28 - 90:32)
I've only been in a party with one other (90:30 - 90:34)
person yeah but they were getting their (90:32 - 90:36)
party (90:34 - 90:39)
blast way quicker than me like they were (90:36 - 90:42)
able to do it like I was I did it the (90:39 - 90:43)
most (90:42 - 90:46)
during like dark cry I think yeah dark (90:43 - 90:48)
cry so I brought Mega (90:46 - 90:51)
gavor as my lead cuz you know I'm a pro (90:48 - 90:54)
Pokemon go player here bringing my mega (90:51 - 90:56)
Pokemon to boost fairy types no it was (90:54 - 90:59)
guzzlord guzzlord guzzlord um and I (90:56 - 91:01)
never got to hit that button because (90:59 - 91:05)
guzzlord would be dead before my meter (91:01 - 91:07)
would fill and I was just using Mega (91:05 - 91:11)
Gore obviously guz Gord super weak to (91:07 - 91:13)
fery but they were able to use it like (91:11 - 91:15)
two (91:13 - 91:18)
times uh and I was like why are they I (91:15 - 91:21)
want to hit the party button but mine's (91:18 - 91:23)
not filling up (91:21 - 91:25)
and then uh when I was doing dark cry I (91:23 - 91:29)
didn't Mega gavor I think I Mega like La (91:25 - 91:32)
honey or something um and then I was (91:29 - 91:35)
able to hit the button cuz and I noticed (91:32 - 91:37)
it was filling a lot faster so I I I (91:35 - 91:39)
think there is something based off like (91:37 - 91:42)
your fast move uh again I don't know if (91:39 - 91:44)
like if you are lower level it feels (91:42 - 91:45)
faster for you to make it feel like (91:44 - 91:48)
you're doing something um (91:45 - 91:51)
regardless that move does a lot of (91:48 - 91:54)
damage uh uh and it's it's great uh it (91:51 - 91:58)
it does make in-person raids with less (91:54 - 92:03)
people worth doing like I think one of (91:58 - 92:05)
the probably one of the complaints you (92:03 - 92:07)
hear is (92:05 - 92:10)
like oh this raid took the entire time (92:07 - 92:11)
because there was only three of us or (92:10 - 92:14)
four of us and it's just us all staring (92:11 - 92:16)
at each other tapping our screen because (92:14 - 92:18)
there's no other strategy than that so (92:16 - 92:20)
getting through that quicker feels good (92:18 - 92:24)
feels better yeah parties benefit raids (92:20 - 92:26)
in a big way there's also the fact that (92:24 - 92:29)
if someone in your party is invited to a (92:26 - 92:31)
remote raid they can basically share (92:29 - 92:34)
that invite with the whole (92:31 - 92:38)
party MH and anyone can join that remote (92:34 - 92:43)
raid which is new and very (92:38 - 92:43)
cool so uh you know Niantic said their (92:44 - 92:50)
mission was to make inperson more (92:47 - 92:54)
rewarding and (92:50 - 92:54)
better uh being in a party and doing (92:54 - 93:00)
raids is is better it's arguably better (92:57 - 93:01)
it (93:00 - 93:05)
is and it doesn't cost anything uh you (93:01 - 93:09)
just have to connect so I think I I and (93:05 - 93:10)
again I think that goes back to (93:09 - 93:15)
niantic's initiative of trying to help (93:10 - 93:17)
people form a community because if you (93:15 - 93:20)
are at a community (93:17 - 93:23)
day you I know and and there are a bunch (93:20 - 93:26)
of raids which gosh please crank the (93:23 - 93:28)
raid meter up for Community Days I'm (93:26 - 93:31)
begging you I just I I I just want to (93:28 - 93:34)
like break up the monotony of catching (93:31 - 93:35)
with like a couple (93:34 - 93:38)
raids it does encourage you to maybe (93:35 - 93:40)
reach out to people or those people who (93:38 - 93:42)
don't came to community day without any (93:40 - 93:45)
friends to be like maybe I should be in (93:42 - 93:47)
a party like I don't have to actually (93:45 - 93:49)
stand near them I can kind of walk (93:47 - 93:51)
pretty far away and still get the (93:49 - 93:53)
benefits (93:51 - 93:56)
um there's only (93:53 - 94:00)
like so much ni can do to be like we're (93:56 - 94:02)
giving you tools you got to use the (94:00 - 94:05)
tools I get it I mean maybe you don't (94:02 - 94:07)
want to ever talk to anyone ever and you (94:05 - 94:08)
just want to put your headphones in and (94:07 - 94:12)
play Pokemon go by yourself totally cool (94:08 - 94:15)
totally fair normally (94:12 - 94:20)
doable but um yeah (94:15 - 94:20)
uh I like it I just I think everyone (94:20 - 94:28)
just wants better rewards slight changes (94:25 - 94:30)
I also want there to be a medal I was (94:28 - 94:32)
really hoping there would be a medal for (94:30 - 94:35)
however many no there's noal for it oh (94:32 - 94:38)
well call it all off yeah why even (94:35 - 94:40)
bother do it's a bad feature don't even (94:38 - 94:44)
use it never mind no metal no metal No (94:40 - 94:46)
Deal all right well I think that's uh (94:44 - 94:50)
that's our show for today um wow (94:46 - 94:51)
actually said something positive about (94:50 - 94:53)
an Niantic this episode crazy uh we will (94:51 - 94:56)
be back next (94:53 - 94:59)
week uh I'm sure has there been a (94:56 - 95:02)
sevenstar raid recently I'm sure they'll (94:59 - 95:04)
announce a sevenstar raid as soon as I (95:02 - 95:05)
post this (95:04 - 95:08)
episode it'll probably be like tan or (95:05 - 95:10)
samur or something I don't know they did (95:08 - 95:13)
deui they did deui so you would think (95:10 - 95:15)
they would have to do tyan and samur (95:13 - 95:19)
eventually did we not have Samurai yet (95:15 - 95:20)
we had the regular samurai oh had the (95:19 - 95:24)
regular Samurai oh boy tyion makes the (95:20 - 95:27)
most sense cuz spooky season spooky (95:24 - 95:29)
season I guess (95:27 - 95:33)
you samur cuz it's dark I I (95:29 - 95:35)
suppose one's (95:33 - 95:38)
ghost if I was to beted it would be (95:35 - 95:41)
tyion if I was a betting man tyion would (95:38 - 95:44)
be next also maybe they just don't care (95:41 - 95:47)
cuz like they after Halloween yeah it's (95:44 - 95:48)
after Halloween and they already did (95:47 - 95:52)
Miss Magus so but I I'm glad they didn't (95:48 - 95:54)
do a (95:52 - 95:56)
sevenstar and mass outbreaks at the same (95:54 - 95:58)
time yeah so what's happening on the (95:56 - 95:59)
10th because that's when it's going to (95:58 - 96:02)
hit isn't everything happening on the (95:59 - 96:04)
10th that's when it's going to happen (96:02 - 96:05)
yeah yeah yeah a lot of things are (96:04 - 96:07)
happening on the 10th yeah that is AB (96:05 - 96:09)
going to be I was going to say there's (96:07 - 96:11)
no way the DLC could come out the 10th (96:09 - 96:14)
because that's the Latin (96:11 - 96:14)
America Regional Tournament but also (96:15 - 96:22)
also exactly when it's coming out do you (96:19 - 96:24)
remember when let's go Pikachu let's go (96:22 - 96:27)
Eevee came out and the next day was the (96:24 - 96:30)
UK the London Regional Tournament Force (96:27 - 96:35)
Ultra Sun Ultra y y actually I take it (96:30 - 96:38)
all back DLC on the 10th it's going to (96:35 - 96:41)
be on the 10th they just they they just (96:38 - 96:43)
couldn't hold the street date of their (96:41 - 96:46)
cartridges yeah they're lining all up (96:43 - 96:48)
they love to do a huge and of course (96:46 - 96:49)
they would do that to like the Latin (96:48 - 96:52)
America people finally get like a decent (96:49 - 96:56)
Regional and they're like ah no um guess (96:52 - 97:00)
what yeah I I I guess we'll see so (96:56 - 97:03)
um if if if there is a raid event (97:00 - 97:06)
announced I will do some Builds on (97:03 - 97:09)
Monday uh YouTube video ideally (97:06 - 97:11)
hopefully go up on Tuesday and then (97:09 - 97:14)
obviously raids would be Thursday Friday (97:11 - 97:17)
um for that stuff so if there is a (97:14 - 97:20)
RAID um anyways uh if you're watching on (97:17 - 97:23)
YouTube (97:20 - 97:23)
what was the I don't remember what we (97:23 - 97:26)

YouTube question for the break and now I (97:26 - 97:29)

think would be a good 7star raid that (98:06 - 98:12)
isn't like Ty floan or samarat cuz we (98:09 - 98:15)
already know that those are like (98:12 - 98:17)
eventually coming there's no way they (98:15 - 98:20)
would just do deui and then call it (98:17 - 98:25)
quits I we say that and (98:20 - 98:25)
yet uh ho Lugia is the obvious Huga ohia (98:26 - 98:36)
it's it's written in stone when (98:33 - 98:39)
Andia ogre Pond and that doesn't like (98:36 - 98:41)
make a lot of sense they're not going to (98:39 - 98:43)
put like a brand new legendary in Seven (98:41 - 98:45)
Stars it would have to like be like (98:43 - 98:48)

with something like like like what I (98:48 - 98:52)

what moves it would have cuz they made (98:56 - 99:01)
Seven Star Pikachu like kind of hard um (98:57 - 99:02)
