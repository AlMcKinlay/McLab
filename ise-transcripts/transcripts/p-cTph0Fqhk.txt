wrestler from jakarta Jakara takara (1:32 - 1:38)
there we go i don't know why i say it (1:36 - 1:40)
wrong but it's true Cara that is right (1:38 - 1:43)
that is a wrestling promotion like TNA (1:40 - 1:47)
like WWE like ROH just a different (1:43 - 1:49)
wrestling promotion now before you turn (1:47 - 1:50)

huge pok√©mon player and so we talked (1:54 - 1:58)
Pokemon we talked some video game we (1:56 - 2:00)
talked a little bit about just wrestling (1:58 - 2:03)
and how how that works more so net like (2:00 - 2:04)
what's it like to be a wrestler it's (2:03 - 2:07)
more so how do you fit video games in (2:04 - 2:09)
while always being on the road that kind (2:07 - 2:12)
of thing mmm and is his name Ophidian (2:09 - 2:13)
because he likes set trading card game (2:12 - 2:17)
that I play no but his his oh well maybe (2:13 - 2:19)
I don't know his character gimmick is he (2:17 - 2:24)
is a snake from Egypt I'm I'm not doing (2:19 - 2:27)
its service he will he will obviously (2:24 - 2:29)
explain that during the part of that (2:27 - 2:32)
part of the interview and so we're going (2:29 - 2:33)
to talk about news (2:32 - 2:37)

with Pokemon of the week so that's the (2:45 - 2:50)
show for you guys today before we get to (2:47 - 2:52)
that though because we have to of course (2:50 - 2:55)
first steer way off topic then come back (2:52 - 2:57)
otherwise this whole show falls apart (2:55 - 3:01)
but what's new what's good Logan it's (2:57 - 3:03)
been a while since you've been on how (3:01 - 3:05)
have you been yeah I've been really (3:03 - 3:08)
great you know been playing pokemon go (3:05 - 3:11)
until I didn't so much anymore but (3:08 - 3:13)
eagerly awaiting for that to get good (3:11 - 3:15)
again of course I'm I'm getting ahead of (3:13 - 3:16)
myself talk about Pokemon related things (3:15 - 3:20)
I was on the Tuesday night podcast just (3:16 - 3:25)
now we recorded that awesome dungeons (3:20 - 3:27)
and dragon i'ts mini campaign at gencon (3:25 - 3:29)
which I'm really excited about everybody (3:27 - 3:31)
listening to that's and I've been (3:29 - 3:34)
working a lot playing a bunch of a games (3:31 - 3:36)
and stuff finished undertale that was (3:34 - 3:38)
super fun we sort of had our undertale (3:36 - 3:43)
discussion not on the podcast so you (3:38 - 3:45)
really liked it this I did I really (3:43 - 3:46)
liked it a lot like tomorrow more than (3:45 - 3:49)
spj did tell you that I mean I did play (3:46 - 3:51)
all of it and then watched all the (3:49 - 3:54)
alternative stuff some away I'm well (3:51 - 3:58)
versed in the undernet the tales of the (3:54 - 4:01)
tales I don't know I just love love sans (3:58 - 4:03)
that characters great actually all the (4:01 - 4:06)
characters are great and I laughed out (4:03 - 4:08)
loud a lot playing that game and I (4:06 - 4:11)
probably haven't laughed out loud or I (4:08 - 4:13)
haven't left out loud that much at a (4:11 - 4:16)
piece of media in a really long time I (4:13 - 4:17)
can't remember the last time that I've (4:16 - 4:19)
experienced like a anything a book of (4:17 - 4:22)
podcast well I guess the adventure zone (4:19 - 4:23)
is made me laugh out loud quite a bit (4:22 - 4:26)
but um is that you laugh pretty hard (4:23 - 4:28)
during our dungeons and dragon night (4:26 - 4:31)
sessions that's very true but that's (4:28 - 4:32)
like I don't know that feels like a (4:31 - 4:34)
totally separate realm because it's like (4:32 - 4:36)
us it's like real people you know it's (4:34 - 4:38)
not really a it doesn't count as a media (4:36 - 4:41)
thing if I'm currently doing it with all (4:38 - 4:43)
the people live right isn't yeah you're (4:41 - 4:46)
all fake people here yeah when you when (4:43 - 4:47)
you listen to the event (4:46 - 4:49)
his own it's nothing but fake people I (4:47 - 4:51)
you know what I mean I mean like I was (4:49 - 4:56)
in a room what up yeah dying okay but (4:51 - 4:58)
you guys are fake people that's Ritter (4:56 - 5:01)
yes that's true no one's arguing with (4:58 - 5:04)
that well how have you been I am so (5:01 - 5:06)
stressed out right now because you're (5:04 - 5:09)
making this so difficult because like (5:06 - 5:10)
Logan said we literally recorded tuesday (5:09 - 5:13)
night podcast like 15 minutes ago and so (5:10 - 5:15)
this could kind of be like part two of (5:13 - 5:18)
that except that this is going to come (5:15 - 5:20)
out before that so yeah I don't know how (5:18 - 5:22)
to transcend time and space to speak (5:20 - 5:25)
like I haven't spoken already but I will (5:22 - 5:27)
say this and this is the most important (5:25 - 5:30)
thing I this is almost like my 20th year (5:27 - 5:33)
working Georgetown University new (5:30 - 5:35)
student move in New Student Orientation (5:33 - 5:39)
had my 3ds out on the table in front of (5:35 - 5:42)
me for I think a sum total of eighteen (5:39 - 5:46)
hours and received zero street passes (5:42 - 5:48)
what is wrong with Georgetown University (5:46 - 5:52)
that nobody has a 3ds why why do I work (5:48 - 5:56)
this is literally the antithesis of any (5:52 - 5:58)
universe that I should be and I need to (5:56 - 6:00)
work at the University where everybody (5:58 - 6:03)
has a 3ds tell me where that university (6:00 - 6:04)
is I will apply for a job there i will (6:03 - 6:07)
work there these Georgetown kids are so (6:04 - 6:11)
like dude they don't ya feelin all (6:07 - 6:14)
really in there isn't Georgetown like (6:11 - 6:17)
one of the big top ten colleges I maybe (6:14 - 6:20)
I'm completely off I don't at top 25 toc (6:17 - 6:22)
25 top 25 okay in a specific subject (6:20 - 6:25)
matter we might be in first place but in (6:22 - 6:28)
general college pneus top 25 hmm that's (6:25 - 6:30)
like I feel like if you're going to (6:28 - 6:31)
georgetown you're probably bragging that (6:30 - 6:34)
you're going to georgetown well i mean (6:31 - 6:37)
that's what I do yes I did go to die I'm (6:34 - 6:39)
Georgetown graduate so congrats will (6:37 - 6:41)
anderson and i did go to the best school (6:39 - 6:42)
at Georgetown the School of Foreign (6:41 - 6:44)
Service so double congrats Will Anderson (6:42 - 6:49)
but it's just like I I don't I can't (6:44 - 6:52)
relate to these kids they if they I (6:49 - 6:53)
literally posted on to it I'm like if (6:52 - 6:55)
you're coming to Georgetown's new (6:53 - 6:57)
Student Orientation hit me up at the U (6:55 - 6:59)
is table in red square and (6:57 - 7:02)
we can have a pokemon battle and nobody (6:59 - 7:04)
came to have a pokemon battle do you all (7:02 - 7:07)
do you think the the 3ds has like kind (7:04 - 7:10)
of scene it's light on its way out I (7:07 - 7:14)
feel the 3ds yeah I believe we just had (7:10 - 7:16)
a discussion about how the 3ds has (7:14 - 7:18)
doubled sales since july of last year or (7:16 - 7:21)
anything like that you're right you're (7:18 - 7:23)
right but it's still sort of in its and (7:21 - 7:26)
it's like last phases it just has sort (7:23 - 7:29)
of like a rebirth because uh them do (7:26 - 7:31)
monster hunter came out and everybody's (7:29 - 7:33)
psyched about Pokemon yeah I mean what (7:31 - 7:36)
else to say for I just want to be very (7:33 - 7:37)
clear about all the people who are (7:36 - 7:39)
talking about how Nintendo is a dying (7:37 - 7:42)
business or whatever how like Japan (7:39 - 7:46)
specifically used Nintendo concepts and (7:42 - 7:48)
imagery for their announcement for the (7:46 - 7:51)
tokyo olympics yeah because such an (7:48 - 7:52)
irrelevant and going out of business (7:51 - 7:55)
company i love about i'm not saying that (7:52 - 7:59)
like the 3ds is doomed or or its out the (7:55 - 8:01)
window i'm just saying the hardware (7:59 - 8:04)
itself is a bit old and with no the (8:01 - 8:07)
rumor saying and the concepts of the NX (8:04 - 8:09)
coming out and possibly it being like a (8:07 - 8:12)
portable / that would spark more people (8:09 - 8:15)
to carry their devices around I don't go (8:12 - 8:17)
out anymore with my 3ds I used to take (8:15 - 8:19)
it everywhere to and from work and now (8:17 - 8:22)
my 3ds cat assets on my coffee table and (8:19 - 8:23)
like when I go to a convention i bring (8:22 - 8:26)
my 3ds well all I can say to you is be a (8:23 - 8:28)
part of the solution not be a part of (8:26 - 8:30)
the problem I love three days I'm not (8:28 - 8:32)
saying I don't I'm just saying that it's (8:30 - 8:35)
it's the hardware's a little old I need (8:32 - 8:39)
puzzle pieces I need like 200 puzzle (8:35 - 8:41)
pieces all complete at all no I know you (8:39 - 8:42)
do because you never have your 3ds with (8:41 - 8:44)
you see you never get puzzle pieces I i (8:42 - 8:46)
would probably suffer the same issues (8:44 - 8:48)
you're suffering from right now and not (8:46 - 8:50)
a lot of people are straight passing me (8:48 - 8:52)
so then I just stopped ringing the 3ds (8:50 - 8:53)
because if I wasn't getting straight (8:52 - 8:55)
passes what's the point it just it just (8:53 - 8:56)
makes me cry Georgetown students you're (8:55 - 8:58)
18 years old you're not a lawyer yet (8:56 - 9:00)
you're allowed to have some fun break (8:58 - 9:02)

stressed on Wednesday the first day of (9:24 - 9:30)
classes oh um ophidian means a snake or (9:25 - 9:32)
relating to snakes so now I've learned (9:30 - 9:34)
something character as a snake good call (9:32 - 9:37)
back let's jump let's jump into some (9:34 - 9:39)
news and then we can go off the rails (9:37 - 9:41)

a i'm a very nervous flyer and I've (10:41 - 10:49)
never been to Seattle or that area so (10:45 - 10:50)
that's kind of all new to me and (10:49 - 10:52)
everything but I am excited for that (10:50 - 10:55)
other than that I've been playing a lot (10:52 - 10:57)
of monster huntin hunter at night so not (10:55 - 10:59)
a lot like an hour or so if if people (10:57 - 11:01)
are in the slack and they're willing to (10:59 - 11:03)
hunt we have a a lot we've had an (11:01 - 11:05)
increase of people buying monster hunter (11:03 - 11:07)
and in slack and going this is my first (11:05 - 11:10)
monster hunter and so I'm just trying to (11:07 - 11:13)
make time to make sure that they enjoy (11:10 - 11:15)
monster hunter because that (11:13 - 11:17)
is a real intimidating game yeah it's (11:15 - 11:19)
real intimidating but it's real fun I (11:17 - 11:21)
killed two great Macau simultaneously (11:19 - 11:23)
this morning and I know it's just a (11:21 - 11:25)
village quest huh so it's the most (11:23 - 11:27)
wonderful feeling like every time I (11:25 - 11:29)
literate I mean I keep saying this but (11:27 - 11:31)
it's so true I literally do not get out (11:29 - 11:33)
of bed in the morning until I've killed (11:31 - 11:35)
something and it's like I've already (11:33 - 11:37)
done my greatest accomplishment of the (11:35 - 11:39)
day and i'm still in bed yeah it's great (11:37 - 11:42)
i like to kill something before i go to (11:39 - 11:44)
bed yeah that's my that's my jam um (11:42 - 11:46)
that's what I saved my gather quests (11:44 - 11:48)
chill you know get me some mushrooms go (11:46 - 11:51)
to bed I like to go to bed knowing that (11:48 - 11:53)
I've not only killed a creature but I've (11:51 - 11:55)
skinned it and I am now wearing it for (11:53 - 12:00)
the next day haha but that time we (11:55 - 12:02)
killed like six ghormeh galas oh yeah (12:00 - 12:05)
that was good i need to kill more Igor's (12:02 - 12:07)
by the way I'm I'm like three Gore short (12:05 - 12:10)
of a set i'm down to hunt definitely (12:07 - 12:12)
yeah let's do it speaking of down to (12:10 - 12:17)
hunting 10 million people are no longer (12:12 - 12:20)
down to play pokemon go that was really (12:17 - 12:22)
good you should have been like down to (12:20 - 12:24)
hunt pokemon yeah I should've I didn't (12:22 - 12:26)
want to say the word hunt a lot but yeah (12:24 - 12:29)
this article this article's been (12:26 - 12:32)
everywhere this you know 11 new site (12:29 - 12:34)
reports they all report it here Ars (12:32 - 12:36)
Technica is where I've looked here (12:34 - 12:38)
Pokemon go loses luster sheds more than (12:36 - 12:42)
10 million users engagement downloads (12:38 - 12:45)
and time spent in the app are fading (12:42 - 12:49)
fast now I will say that's a large drop (12:45 - 12:53)
in user base is very standard for almost (12:49 - 12:56)
any app so I I do think that a lot of (12:53 - 12:59)
news outlets are running with this in a (12:56 - 13:01)
way that is a little bit more hyperbolic (12:59 - 13:04)
than and perhaps it should be because (13:01 - 13:06)
like every app experience is like a (13:04 - 13:08)
20-percent dip and users after its (13:06 - 13:10)
initially released yeah and and if (13:08 - 13:12)
you're if you're a new listener too it's (13:10 - 13:16)
super effective we I think without a (13:12 - 13:18)
doubt we all loved and enjoyed our time (13:16 - 13:20)
with Pokemon go we might not be playing (13:18 - 13:23)
it every week or every day I mean I'm (13:20 - 13:24)
definitely gonna be playing it when I'm (13:23 - 13:25)
in Seattle because I want to see what (13:24 - 13:27)
their Pokemon look like us and (13:25 - 13:28)
especially because its convention (13:27 - 13:30)
I'm so there are so many lures and (13:28 - 13:32)
everything that are being placed around (13:30 - 13:35)
but but my point was we have been very (13:32 - 13:37)
hard on Pokemon go but we've also been (13:35 - 13:39)
very positive on Pokemon go so I don't (13:37 - 13:40)
know how this again turned out I don't (13:39 - 13:42)
know if this is gonna be as complaining (13:40 - 13:44)
or us being like nah put mine goes so (13:42 - 13:46)
good I'll read the article first it has (13:44 - 13:49)
been almost it had almost 45 million (13:46 - 13:52)
daily users in July but figures appear (13:49 - 13:54)
to have been sunk by almost 12 million (13:52 - 13:57)
since the start of August to just over (13:54 - 14:00)
30 million people now playing pokemon go (13:57 - 14:02)
further decline is expected as downloads (14:00 - 14:04)
engagements and time spent using the app (14:02 - 14:07)
have visibly flopped according to data (14:04 - 14:10)
provided by census sensor tower survey (14:07 - 14:13)
monkey and app topia bloomberg which saw (14:10 - 14:15)
the raw data reported that the other (14:13 - 14:17)
majority apps such as Twitter Facebook (14:15 - 14:20)
and snapchat can breathe a sigh of (14:17 - 14:22)
relief that Pokemon go was finally (14:20 - 14:24)
wobbling as the game's popularity has a (14:22 - 14:27)
bit has apparently been costing them (14:24 - 14:30)
considerable amounts of users given the (14:27 - 14:33)
rapid rise in usage of Pokemon goes apps (14:30 - 14:36)
since the launch in July investors have (14:33 - 14:38)
been concerned that this new user (14:36 - 14:40)
experience has been distracting by time (14:38 - 14:43)
spent on other mobile-focused apps that (14:40 - 14:45)
some analysts from some capital (14:43 - 14:48)
management place developer niantic is (14:45 - 14:51)
preserving the game however is do with a (14:48 - 14:54)
release version for Android and iOS (14:51 - 14:56)
there's a new patch coming out that (14:54 - 14:57)
we're going to talk about next niantic (14:56 - 15:00)
also hinted at upcoming developments and (14:57 - 15:02)
designs to improve the games (15:00 - 15:05)
questionable long tivity they stated (15:02 - 15:08)
this is knee antic quote we are working (15:05 - 15:10)
hard on several new and exciting (15:08 - 15:12)
features come to come in the future of (15:10 - 15:15)
Pokemon go and quote very generic quote (15:12 - 15:18)
I'll give them that but we'll talk about (15:15 - 15:20)
the update here in a second let's talk (15:18 - 15:22)
about this news though Logan you already (15:20 - 15:24)
mentioned that a lot of apps see a (15:22 - 15:27)
decline after the first week or so yeah (15:24 - 15:30)
I think Pokemon go surprised all of us (15:27 - 15:33)
not only from how it blew out of the (15:30 - 15:36)
gate at such a enormous speed of getting (15:33 - 15:38)
new users on but I was more so (15:36 - 15:40)
impressive how those users stayed on for (15:38 - 15:42)
weeks and now we're we're (15:40 - 15:44)
are almost in two months three of this (15:42 - 15:48)
game yeah I mean honestly like I said (15:44 - 15:49)
like the dip that's a very standard (15:48 - 15:53)
percentage dip for you know when a game (15:49 - 15:56)
is very hype brought to the next month (15:53 - 15:58)
or whatever but normally that that (15:56 - 16:01)
occurs over like a week or two you have (15:58 - 16:02)
like a maximum user base and then it (16:01 - 16:05)
trails off quickly the Pokemon had a (16:02 - 16:07)
pretty long pretty long tail for the Hat (16:05 - 16:10)
I mean I I'm still impressed with it and (16:07 - 16:12)
I don't know most of these articles (16:10 - 16:14)
aren't presenting you with like similar (16:12 - 16:17)
statistics for other apps like clash (16:14 - 16:19)
royale or whatever you know like well I (16:17 - 16:21)
think that was probably a very similar (16:19 - 16:22)
trajectory and I don't necessarily think (16:21 - 16:25)
that that means it's suddenly not a (16:22 - 16:28)
success or not making the money you know (16:25 - 16:30)
I yeah I want to see I want to see the (16:28 - 16:33)
comparison to candy crush like right now (16:30 - 16:34)
what's the what's the curve on people (16:33 - 16:37)
dropping off on that or still playing or (16:34 - 16:40)
anything like that we'll use you said (16:37 - 16:42)
that you were around for new student (16:40 - 16:44)
orientation where did you notice Pokemon (16:42 - 16:47)
go players or no did I mention how (16:44 - 16:49)
disappointed I am in Georgetown students (16:47 - 16:52)
no pokemon go players no you didn't see (16:49 - 16:54)
a single phone with Pokemon go on it as (16:52 - 16:56)
you were standing outside other than my (16:54 - 16:59)
own no all right and George and George (16:56 - 17:00)
Sheldon the campus is full of polka (16:59 - 17:03)
stops oh I believe it even some of my (17:00 - 17:04)
co-workers were complaint yeah some of (17:03 - 17:07)
my co-workers were complaining that some (17:04 - 17:08)
of the pokey stops on campus we've (17:07 - 17:10)
changed the names of some of the (17:08 - 17:12)
buildings but the pokey stops are still (17:10 - 17:14)
named the old name of the buildings so I (17:12 - 17:17)
had to explain to them why that is but (17:14 - 17:20)
like it's mostly my co-workers and none (17:17 - 17:22)
of the I did not see any suits then (17:20 - 17:23)
again like all the students like their (17:22 - 17:25)
parents were standing over their (17:23 - 17:27)
shoulders the entire time so the (17:25 - 17:29)
thinking like we paid a lot of money for (17:27 - 17:32)
you to go to this school you best not be (17:29 - 17:35)
playing pokemon exactly you know you (17:32 - 17:37)
know it's funny is um we had free (17:35 - 17:39)
handouts on our table and like all these (17:37 - 17:41)
parents were like like little cell phone (17:39 - 17:43)
pad things and everything and they're (17:41 - 17:45)
like oh can we take this and I literally (17:43 - 17:47)
said to every parent that said that your (17:45 - 17:49)
tuition money paid for that take as many (17:47 - 17:52)
as you ha but yeah they were i guess i (17:49 - 17:54)
will step back a little from criticizing (17:52 - 17:56)
georgetown students that parents are (17:54 - 17:58)
little intense over this weekend and (17:56 - 18:01)
maybe things will chill out a little bit (17:58 - 18:04)
more there is a Pokemon gym at the (18:01 - 18:06)
location the building where our (18:04 - 18:09)
technology service desk is and I know (18:06 - 18:11)
that that has changed over between teams (18:09 - 18:15)
a few times so that there's that level (18:11 - 18:17)
of activity and it's just we're kind of (18:15 - 18:19)
in a weird location in DC where there's (18:17 - 18:22)
not as many people as maybe downtown or (18:19 - 18:25)
where the monuments are so I don't know (18:22 - 18:26)
I there's always going to be plenty of (18:25 - 18:29)
Pokemon go in DC just because of the (18:26 - 18:32)
number of people who travel through here (18:29 - 18:34)
and like just like you when they travel (18:32 - 18:35)
here they're going to want to play (18:34 - 18:37)
pokemon go just because DC is different (18:35 - 18:39)
and especially because we have all the (18:37 - 18:41)
monuments where there will be pokey (18:39 - 18:42)
stops and gyms and things that are worth (18:41 - 18:45)
actually playing against hmm totally (18:42 - 18:47)
totally well there is a new update for (18:45 - 18:50)
Pokemon go this came out I had probably (18:47 - 18:51)
four or five days ago it's a new patch (18:50 - 18:55)
that introduces Pokemon appraisal for (18:51 - 18:58)
Android that's going to be 0.3 5.0 and (18:55 - 19:01)
for iOS that's going to be 1.50 Pokemon (18:58 - 19:04)
appraisal allows players that are on a (19:01 - 19:06)
team that's the important note you have (19:04 - 19:09)
to be on valor mystic or instinct to get (19:06 - 19:11)
appropriate evaluations of their Pokemon (19:09 - 19:13)
IVs similar to stat judge in the core (19:11 - 19:15)
series game pokemon appraisals can be (19:13 - 19:18)
accessed on the menu button Pokemon (19:15 - 19:20)
appraisals is done by that players gym (19:18 - 19:22)
leader specific wording just like the (19:20 - 19:24)
game like all this pok√©mons excellent (19:22 - 19:26)
this pok√©mons good this pok√©mons okay (19:24 - 19:29)
this pok√©mons terrible i'm just (19:26 - 19:30)
generalizing but i believe there are (19:29 - 19:33)
four levels if the Pokemon has a height (19:30 - 19:34)
or weight that differs significantly (19:33 - 19:36)
from the average that will also be (19:34 - 19:38)
commented additionally Pokemon that are (19:36 - 19:40)
ejected from a gym now return fainted (19:38 - 19:43)
instead of at one HP this has been (19:40 - 19:45)
applied server side so it will occur (19:43 - 19:47)
regardless whether or not the patch has (19:45 - 19:49)
been downloaded how do you guys feel (19:47 - 19:52)
about the appraisal feature that that (19:49 - 19:54)
that's added somebody needs to explain (19:52 - 19:56)
to me does the appraisal feature mean (19:54 - 19:58)
that the Pokemon you catch besides the (19:56 - 20:00)
CP that they have that they have IVs (19:58 - 20:02)
that are hidden is that what it's (20:00 - 20:05)
telling yes I know that okay it pretty (20:02 - 20:08)
much comes down to there are your (20:05 - 20:10)
Pokemon falls into excellent (20:08 - 20:14)
great good or bad and the the amount of (20:10 - 20:17)
Stardust's you give to it if it's like (20:14 - 20:19)
if it's great you would want excellent (20:17 - 20:21)
because your Stardust going into an (20:19 - 20:24)
excellent is just worth it more like (20:21 - 20:26)
that Pokemon will hit a higher CP level (20:24 - 20:28)
at the end of the day I'm trying to like (20:26 - 20:30)
break that down to really like simplest (20:28 - 20:33)
yeah it's hard for me since I still (20:30 - 20:34)
haven't joined a team and I can't battle (20:33 - 20:36)
gyms and stuff the whole battling and (20:34 - 20:39)
any part of that has is a mystery to me (20:36 - 20:43)
well so there's three the beyond CP CP (20:39 - 20:46)
is comprised of like your average of the (20:43 - 20:49)
three attributes which are attack HP and (20:46 - 20:54)
oh man the other one defense oh wait I (20:49 - 20:56)
already said that no no you defense yeah (20:54 - 20:58)
that was the last one okay cool alright (20:56 - 21:02)
well and so it's not like regular (20:58 - 21:04)
pokemon where you have to yep you want (21:02 - 21:06)
to get maximum zon six different stats (21:04 - 21:09)
it's much easier to find a perfect oh (21:06 - 21:14)
c'mon but you I can you do you were (21:09 - 21:16)
researching that earlier will like can (21:14 - 21:19)
you still get appraisals if you're not (21:16 - 21:21)
on a team no you can't i cannot get an (21:19 - 21:23)
appraisal you have to talk to your your (21:21 - 21:26)
judge okay your leader well you should (21:23 - 21:30)
join a team what's stopping you ah the (21:26 - 21:32)
acrimony that existed between all the (21:30 - 21:35)
teams at the beginning I I will no no no (21:32 - 21:37)
no multi-party let me ask a different (21:35 - 21:40)
question is this what you would have (21:37 - 21:43)
wanted in an update no I can't believe (21:40 - 21:45)
they spent so much time on this thing (21:43 - 21:50)
that like the the footsteps still are (21:45 - 21:53)
very broken I don't understand why (21:50 - 21:56)
they're not just fixing the pizza well (21:53 - 21:58)
for me all I want it all I want is to (21:56 - 21:59)
track down Pokemon that's the whole (21:58 - 22:03)
thing and for me personally I think the (21:59 - 22:05)
gym system is really weak not a very (22:03 - 22:08)
good combat system it's way easier to (22:05 - 22:10)
take down a gym than it is to train at a (22:08 - 22:12)
gym which doesn't make any sense at all (22:10 - 22:16)
and any gym near me if you take if a (22:12 - 22:17)
team takes it over you can just watch it (22:16 - 22:20)
fall and be rebuilt as a different team (22:17 - 22:22)
every 30 minutes there's nothing nothing (22:20 - 22:24)
stays put so there's no (22:22 - 22:26)
the the resources you have to pour into (22:24 - 22:29)
doing that is not worth it yeah I do I (22:26 - 22:31)
don't so I saw the update and I went (22:29 - 22:36)
okay that is silly great I I can't so if (22:31 - 22:39)
I'm if I'm in somebody's footsteps (22:36 - 22:42)
somebody shoes not their footsteps I'm (22:39 - 22:44)
thinking footsteps because of the foot (22:42 - 22:47)
steps that were taken away yeah if I'm (22:44 - 22:52)
in somebody's shoes and my main appeal (22:47 - 22:54)
my favorite thing about Pokemon go is (22:52 - 22:57)
the battling like am i still even (22:54 - 23:01)
excited that there is now this hidden IV (22:57 - 23:04)
system to say that my Pokemon fits into (23:01 - 23:06)
the one of these four categories and (23:04 - 23:09)
great this Pokemon is excellent and now (23:06 - 23:10)
I train them up and then I sent him to a (23:09 - 23:12)
gym and then in a day that that pokemon (23:10 - 23:14)
comes back to me fainted because Jim's (23:12 - 23:18)
don't last that long ray it how it I (23:14 - 23:19)
would love to talk to somebody where (23:18 - 23:22)
they go like this is the best thing ever (23:19 - 23:25)
because i think the battling system in (23:22 - 23:26)
the gym see a system like you said is (23:25 - 23:29)
the weakest part of the game and adding (23:26 - 23:31)
i like saying that this pokemon this (23:29 - 23:33)
Charizard that you have is slightly (23:31 - 23:36)
better than this Charizard ok cool it (23:33 - 23:39)
doesn't matter either Charizard i put in (23:36 - 23:40)
there is going to come back to me (23:39 - 23:42)
tomorrow right that's exactly my point (23:40 - 23:45)
like there's where in competitive (23:42 - 23:49)
Pokemon like the games for 3ds those (23:45 - 23:52)
those like getting a 31 instead of a 30 (23:49 - 23:54)
in your IV really matters it really it (23:52 - 23:56)
could agree the difference between (23:54 - 23:59)
surviving an attack or not but it's it's (23:56 - 24:00)
a matter of if they're gonna stay in (23:59 - 24:03)
that gym for thirty minutes or 32 (24:00 - 24:08)
minutes no it's just not so i will say (24:03 - 24:09)
the one thing is if you're having a hard (24:08 - 24:11)
time deciding which of your pokemon to (24:09 - 24:13)
be the one that you keep if you're (24:11 - 24:14)
turning all the rest of them into (24:13 - 24:17)
candies I mean it helps you somewhat (24:14 - 24:19)
make that selection yeah I will and (24:17 - 24:22)
that's that's fair but I feel like the (24:19 - 24:25)
CP system sort of does that for you in a (24:22 - 24:27)
general sense like I you can definitely (24:25 - 24:31)
tell oh this Magikarp is 10 CP and this (24:27 - 24:33)
Magikarp is a hundred and twenty so I'll (24:31 - 24:37)
keep 120 IA but you're right you you can (24:33 - 24:37)
if you (24:37 - 24:39)
if you're having trouble distinguishing (24:37 - 24:41)
which one is actually going to be the (24:39 - 24:43)
best one long term than yeah go for it (24:41 - 24:47)
but for me I am waiting until gems make (24:43 - 24:49)
any sense to put any resources into (24:47 - 24:52)
before I even spend the one of those (24:49 - 24:54)
even called not candy but the arbiters (24:52 - 24:57)
sir artist I haven't I haven't spent any (24:54 - 24:59)
Stardust since like day three I was (24:57 - 25:01)
going to say the last time I spent (24:59 - 25:03)
Stardust was like day two because I (25:01 - 25:05)
wanted to report on what it did right (25:03 - 25:08)
yeah and then you're just saving it up (25:05 - 25:11)
for I don't know what yeah cuz I'm in a (25:08 - 25:15)
position where I have no interest in (25:11 - 25:17)
taking over a gym because I know that it (25:15 - 25:20)
will just get taken back so if there is (25:17 - 25:23)
a gym I'll leave a Pokemon there and (25:20 - 25:25)
then collect my ten gold and then (25:23 - 25:28)
tomorrow I'll see that like that Pokemon (25:25 - 25:29)
is no longer at the gym and that's okay (25:28 - 25:32)
like that's cool but I don't know like (25:29 - 25:34)
that that the battling is not (25:32 - 25:37)
interesting to me and i don't i don't (25:34 - 25:40)
see the benefit of the ice IV system (25:37 - 25:42)
because like what you said it what you (25:40 - 25:44)
and I both said is it doesn't but your (25:42 - 25:46)
pokemons going to get objective for that (25:44 - 25:48)
gym no matter what right because the PE (25:46 - 25:51)
defending is always at the disadvantage (25:48 - 25:54)
from attacking but more people asking (25:51 - 25:56)
for this I feel like everyone was just (25:54 - 26:00)
they want footprints and I'm cool right (25:56 - 26:01)
now without the footprints because I (26:00 - 26:04)
play so casually I like when I go to the (26:01 - 26:05)
post office I know others polka stop (26:04 - 26:07)
there I when I go to this store (26:05 - 26:08)
another's focused up there so i will (26:07 - 26:10)
always open my phone before i go into (26:08 - 26:13)
the building get my get my rewards when (26:10 - 26:14)
I come out of the building get my (26:13 - 26:16)
rewards go on my day maybe catch it if (26:14 - 26:17)
there's a Pidgey there because there's a (26:16 - 26:20)
Pidgey everywhere but if I was if I was (26:17 - 26:21)
back to spending three or four hours (26:20 - 26:25)
hunting Pokemon the footsteps would be (26:21 - 26:27)
priority number one but if I'm walking (26:25 - 26:28)
around a convention where there's (26:27 - 26:31)
thousands of stops and everything really (26:28 - 26:33)
my priority number one is making sure I (26:31 - 26:35)
hit all those a thousand stops to stock (26:33 - 26:37)
up on stuff so when I go hunting pokemon (26:35 - 26:41)
i have that exactly I know that none of (26:37 - 26:43)
that was battles this may just be (26:41 - 26:45)
preparation for person on person (26:43 - 26:47)
battling which you know they'll release (26:45 - 26:49)
later so they get you used to the rating (26:47 - 26:50)
system and then (26:49 - 26:52)
person on person battling this will (26:50 - 26:55)
matter more yeah I guess but where was a (26:52 - 26:58)
little bit what's the benefit there but (26:55 - 27:01)
why get them i select the right Pokemon (26:58 - 27:04)
too yeah and i should i should say like (27:01 - 27:05)
there's no benefit of battling your (27:04 - 27:08)
friends in the main series game but the (27:05 - 27:10)
battling system is not for extending the (27:08 - 27:12)
bots of the bonds of friendship yes your (27:10 - 27:15)
Pokemon battles but but the battling (27:12 - 27:18)
system in Pokemon go is just not good so (27:15 - 27:19)
why would I want to do that against (27:18 - 27:22)
friend the current battling system is (27:19 - 27:23)
not good we don't know what the person (27:22 - 27:25)
on person battling system is going to (27:23 - 27:27)
look like who can tap faster I don't (27:25 - 27:29)
know I'm just I'm just joking now but I (27:27 - 27:32)
have one more Pokemon go article this (27:29 - 27:35)
was actually Milwaukee related and so (27:32 - 27:37)
kind of hit home at me hit home with me (27:35 - 27:42)
here I cannot talk but I've talked about (27:37 - 27:44)
this place before Lake Park spent (27:42 - 27:46)
several hours there it was when I saw (27:44 - 27:48)
like the 400 people chased the dragon (27:46 - 27:51)
air or the Dragon Knight I camera can (27:48 - 27:52)
remember i think was dragging it anyways (27:51 - 27:55)
you guys remember that story yeah if you (27:52 - 27:57)
haven't it was like six six or seven (27:55 - 28:00)
episodes ago so this is a letter from (27:57 - 28:04)
the Milwaukee County Park System Tunis (28:00 - 28:08)
antic addressed to the CEO (28:04 - 28:10)

first name I'm gonna read the letter (28:10 - 28:13)
here real quick so again this is for (28:11 - 28:16)
Milwaukee County Parks dear mr. Hankey (28:13 - 28:19)
the Pokemon go phenom phenomenon there (28:16 - 28:21)
we go there we go i said it right the (28:19 - 28:24)
book mango phenomenom it is on full (28:21 - 28:27)
display at milwaukee county parks most (28:24 - 28:31)
notably at its beloved and historic Lake (28:27 - 28:33)
Park National Register of Historic (28:31 - 28:39)
Places number 9 3000 339 indeed this (28:33 - 28:41)
park is a national treasure designed by (28:39 - 28:45)
the renowned Frederick Law Olmsted who (28:41 - 28:47)
once described the park work as a (28:45 - 28:50)
democratic development of the highest (28:47 - 28:53)
significance Lake Park has quickly (28:50 - 28:55)
become known as one of the most active (28:53 - 28:59)
Pokemon go areas in the Midwest I don't (28:55 - 29:02)
know if that's true but anyways the (28:59 - 29:04)
Pokemon go phenomenon has introduced (29:02 - 29:08)
hundreds if not thousands of individuals (29:04 - 29:11)
to our park system and doubtless has (29:08 - 29:14)
resulted in many new positive (29:11 - 29:17)
recreational experiences the Milwaukee (29:14 - 29:19)
County Park System recreation and (29:17 - 29:22)
cultural development applause those (29:19 - 29:25)
outcomes however there have been other (29:22 - 29:28)
unanticipated and negative consequences (29:25 - 29:31)
from Pokemon related activities which (29:28 - 29:34)
have caused significant disruption both (29:31 - 29:37)
within Lake Park and in adjacent (29:34 - 29:40)
neighborhoods these include daily (29:37 - 29:43)
traffic congestion parking issues (29:40 - 29:46)
littering compacted and damaged turf (29:43 - 29:49)
risk too sensitive flora and fauna (29:46 - 29:55)
furama habitat wanna Jana habitats and (29:49 - 29:57)
non-compliance with park system (29:55 - 30:00)

County's parks policy related to virtual (30:04 - 30:10)
geocaches and require you immediate (30:07 - 30:14)
we comply with that policy which (30:10 - 30:16)
includes prior written permission before (30:14 - 30:18)
placement of virtual geocaching in (30:16 - 30:22)
milwaukee county park niantic inc must (30:18 - 30:24)
complete a separate notification (30:22 - 30:28)
placement form for each intended Pokemon (30:24 - 30:30)
go site within the walkie county park (30:28 - 30:32)
system that link can be found here and (30:30 - 30:36)
sent to this address hmm the parks geo (30:32 - 30:38)
get geocaching guidelines link is (30:36 - 30:40)
attached here for your convenience as (30:38 - 30:43)
noted should I antic Inc be granted (30:40 - 30:46)
permission to place Pokemon go sites (30:43 - 30:48)
within any Milwaukee County County Park (30:46 - 30:52)
it will there after be responsibility (30:48 - 30:55)
for regularly monitoring each cash four (30:52 - 30:57)
times per year is recommended and (30:55 - 31:00)
reporting vandalism and debt reiation of (30:57 - 31:05)
property wow so that letter was sent in (31:00 - 31:09)
the antic that was monday that was that (31:05 - 31:11)
was right after 229 came out that letter (31:09 - 31:13)
came out i feel like there's like (31:11 - 31:15)
there's like two possibilities it's (31:13 - 31:19)
either nothing happens with that or knee (31:15 - 31:21)
antic stops supporting those polka stops (31:19 - 31:23)
like they just cut them off yes and (31:21 - 31:26)
that's it I was just gonna say this (31:23 - 31:29)
sounds like such a load of hooey you (31:26 - 31:32)
can't make a law about virtual geocaches (31:29 - 31:34)
that is like the most ridiculous (31:32 - 31:39)
over-reaching non sufficiently specific (31:34 - 31:43)
like what if like a fourth grader does a (31:39 - 31:45)
little map in their free time in their (31:43 - 31:47)
class of Lake Park and they're like oh (31:45 - 31:50)
this is where my imaginary dragons can (31:47 - 31:51)
be found and then like the city of (31:50 - 31:53)
Milwaukee's gonna come crashing you (31:51 - 31:55)
can't have a virtual geocache on your (31:53 - 31:58)
little piece of paper you fourth grader (31:55 - 32:00)
you didn't apply a separate permit for (31:58 - 32:02)
each one and check it four times a year (32:00 - 32:07)
you let a bunch of bunk I will say okay (32:02 - 32:09)
so i have i have milwaukee County's (32:07 - 32:11)
geocaching permit pulled up here i'll (32:09 - 32:15)
talk about that in a second so i saw the (32:11 - 32:18)
post on Reddit and our / milwaukee and (32:15 - 32:21)
then of course people who then i mean (32:18 - 32:24)
this this made it also to the front page (32:21 - 32:26)
I think of are such Pokemon go and so I (32:24 - 32:28)
got some tweets I got some texts about (32:26 - 32:31)
this I said I I saw it thank you for (32:28 - 32:33)
letting me know I plan on talking about (32:31 - 32:35)
it on it's super effective and then (32:33 - 32:37)
later in the day just because I was (32:35 - 32:39)
following it I saw an interview with the (32:37 - 32:41)
gentleman who wrote this the guy in (32:39 - 32:43)
charge of Milwaukee County Parks and the (32:41 - 32:46)
first thing the interviewer asked that (32:43 - 32:48)
guy was do you think knee antics going (32:46 - 32:51)
to respond and he paused roll along then (32:48 - 32:55)
laughed and said I hope so okay she's (32:51 - 32:58)
really good it was really good so uh (32:55 - 33:02)
County Milwaukee gov / I don't know (32:58 - 33:04)
geocaching yep actually it is / (33:02 - 33:08)
geocaching I find that this just kind of (33:04 - 33:11)
punts lays out something find a cache in (33:08 - 33:14)
Milwaukee County Parks geocaching is a (33:11 - 33:16)
popular outdoor scavenger hunt that uses (33:14 - 33:19)
global positioning system aka GPS device (33:16 - 33:21)
and Internet published coordinates to (33:19 - 33:23)
locate virtual or physical cash a (33:21 - 33:26)
virtual cash maybe it may be an amazing (33:23 - 33:28)
view a physical cash maybe a trinket or (33:26 - 33:30)
a log or a book or container hidden (33:28 - 33:33)
under some leaves geocaching is an (33:30 - 33:35)
acceptable activity in parks when (33:33 - 33:38)
following the these guidelines now these (33:35 - 33:40)
are Milwaukee's rules I believe every (33:38 - 33:42)
county state is different types of (33:40 - 33:44)
geocaching allowed in the parts parks (33:42 - 33:46)
virtual preferred method it says in (33:44 - 33:48)
parentheses preferred method coordinates (33:46 - 33:51)
of stationary landmark guides (33:48 - 33:52)
participants to the virtual cache (33:51 - 33:55)
virtual caches are verified by only (33:52 - 33:57)
emailed photos of the cache site (33:55 - 34:01)
physical geocaching participants seek a (33:57 - 34:03)
hidden not buried physical cash a (34:01 - 34:05)
waterproof container storing trade items (34:03 - 34:08)
logbooks for letterbox cash there's (34:05 - 34:09)
usually the logbooks rubber stamps (34:08 - 34:11)
participants may use their own physical (34:09 - 34:13)
log books or their own personal stamps (34:11 - 34:15)
for a micro cash use a smaller container (34:13 - 34:18)
like a film canister to be used based (34:15 - 34:20)
guidelines for geocaching for all (34:18 - 34:22)
participants you must abide by Milwaukee (34:20 - 34:25)
cordie county ordinance you must confirm (34:22 - 34:27)
to leave no trace of outdoor ethic (34:25 - 34:29)
guidelines take nothing but photo pairs (34:27 - 34:31)
leave nothing but footprints for more (34:29 - 34:33)
information of the Leave No Trace (34:31 - 34:35)
principle go here if you discover any (34:33 - 34:37)
illegal or hazardous materials in (34:35 - 34:40)
your cash you must contact Milwaukee (34:37 - 34:41)
County Parks and immediately blah blah (34:40 - 34:44)
blah so that's pretty much it so really (34:41 - 34:47)
the the the whole point to the letter (34:44 - 34:52)
that I understood was knee antic we're (34:47 - 34:55)
cool with this but you need to fill out (34:52 - 34:58)
our form but we know you're not going to (34:55 - 35:02)
so remove these that's like the feeling (34:58 - 35:05)
I got from it that's that's a guy think (35:02 - 35:08)
that's gonna happen and I is that (35:05 - 35:10)
actually what they want do you think you (35:08 - 35:11)
know how to remove the focus on well (35:10 - 35:13)
here's the thing and I don't know if (35:11 - 35:15)
I've ever said this about like Park the (35:13 - 35:18)
lake park looks over Lake Michigan and (35:15 - 35:21)
so below lake park because it is up (35:18 - 35:22)
pretty high and there's like the steep (35:21 - 35:24)
hill that goes down so below lake park (35:22 - 35:27)
is Bradford beach and and lake drive (35:24 - 35:30)
which is just one of the main roads to (35:27 - 35:33)
like get to all these downtown (35:30 - 35:36)
attractions behind lake park if you're (35:33 - 35:38)
if you're looking like Michigan Bradford (35:36 - 35:43)
beach road lake park behind lake park is (35:38 - 35:46)
probably one of the richest (35:43 - 35:50)
neighborhoods in all of Milwaukee ah (35:46 - 35:50)
there you go like no I'm not (35:51 - 35:57)
exaggerating like four million dollar (35:54 - 36:01)
plus houses all along lake park so that (35:57 - 36:03)
Milwaukee which is like a 10 million (36:01 - 36:07)
dollar house anyplace else right yeah 2m (36:03 - 36:10)
that neighborhood he touches like park (36:07 - 36:12)
so lake park is is pretty long it's (36:10 - 36:15)
probably 23 miles long so if you start (36:12 - 36:17)
at one end and Pokemon go and walk to (36:15 - 36:18)
the other end that's probably going to (36:17 - 36:20)
take you in maybe 20 minutes and then (36:18 - 36:22)
you turn around and walk back I have to (36:20 - 36:26)
admit imagine that this is because of (36:22 - 36:28)
that neighborhood for all those people (36:26 - 36:31)
parking on the street for the congestion (36:28 - 36:33)
that it builds because there is there is (36:31 - 36:35)
a parking lot on one side of Lake Park (36:33 - 36:38)
that every time I went to Lake Park was (36:35 - 36:41)
just full and so there's street parking (36:38 - 36:43)
and street parkings you not allow for (36:41 - 36:46)
everyone but that is also filled their (36:43 - 36:49)
the other rumor I heard was there's only (36:46 - 36:51)
one bathroom at Lake Park (36:49 - 36:54)
and it's below a restaurant that also (36:51 - 36:55)
shares with that parking lot it is a (36:54 - 36:58)
public bathroom anyone can use it but it (36:55 - 37:01)
I think it locks at 10 and so since that (36:58 - 37:04)
is the only bathroom for a consistent (37:01 - 37:07)
amount of people just going through with (37:04 - 37:09)
Lake Park that bathroom gets extremely (37:07 - 37:13)
dirty extremely fast II and and if you (37:09 - 37:16)
heard my Pokemon go specials or just (37:13 - 37:19)
normal episodes of its perfective I have (37:16 - 37:21)
talked about you know the police (37:19 - 37:22)
clearing ever would have that 10 because (37:21 - 37:24)
technically technically the park closes (37:22 - 37:27)
at ten and people were prior to that (37:24 - 37:30)
playing very light into the night so (37:27 - 37:33)
I'll just say number one I am a huge (37:30 - 37:35)
believer in the Leave No Trace principle (37:33 - 37:38)
and I think anybody who is enjoying our (37:35 - 37:40)
country's natural resources should (37:38 - 37:42)
familiarize themselves with the tenants (37:40 - 37:44)
of Leave No Trace before entering a (37:42 - 37:46)
national park or any nature preserve (37:44 - 37:49)
area I will make that very clear uh but (37:46 - 37:52)
second I will also say I am a very big (37:49 - 37:55)
fan of something called evidence and I (37:52 - 37:58)
don't think especially governmental (37:55 - 38:00)
bodies should be making claims that any (37:58 - 38:03)
kind of particular damage or occurrence (38:00 - 38:06)
is happening because of a particular (38:03 - 38:09)
well Pokemon go or any other type of (38:06 - 38:11)
thing unless they have evidence showing (38:09 - 38:13)
that each and every person who has (38:11 - 38:15)
damaged a particular location was a (38:13 - 38:18)
Pokemon go player maybe the park is just (38:15 - 38:20)
exceptionally popular this year because (38:18 - 38:21)
a lot of nature lovers have moved to (38:20 - 38:24)
Milwaukee you haven't given me evidence (38:21 - 38:27)
one way or the other you just know that (38:24 - 38:29)
coincidentally and coincidence is not (38:27 - 38:32)
allowable in a court of law Pokemon go (38:29 - 38:34)
has come out at the same time that your (38:32 - 38:37)
reported damage to Milwaukee Parks has (38:34 - 38:39)
occurred now steve has never taken me to (38:37 - 38:41)
lake park because Steve really doesn't (38:39 - 38:45)
like me as a friend but I suspect with (38:41 - 38:49)
my knowledge of Milwaukee first off that (38:45 - 38:50)
park that's over there by the river is (38:49 - 38:52)
going to be much nicer than Lake Park (38:50 - 38:56)
and it's it's it's a public park so yeah (38:52 - 38:59)
so lake park is near beach lake park is (38:56 - 39:01)
also in your marquette which is a very (38:59 - 39:04)
popular university it's also that's (39:01 - 39:06)
party school if I ever heard it it's (39:04 - 39:08)
also another Jesuit University of our (39:06 - 39:11)
country it's also near UWM which is next (39:08 - 39:13)
to the east side which is very close to (39:11 - 39:16)
Lake Park so the the amount of people (39:13 - 39:18)
that go to Lake Park for what you get at (39:16 - 39:22)
Lake Park pocus stop / walking distances (39:18 - 39:24)
Lake Park is the place to go no one's (39:22 - 39:27)
debating that so I get that as popular (39:24 - 39:29)
you they want to fix that you know the (39:27 - 39:32)
simple system the simple way to do it is (39:29 - 39:34)
just remove a couple polka stops there's (39:32 - 39:35)
points in Lake Park where there are four (39:34 - 39:37)
poka poka stops touching each other and (39:35 - 39:39)
people sit there because they don't walk (39:37 - 39:41)
they just hit all four every five (39:39 - 39:44)
minutes absolutely not do not give in to (39:41 - 39:47)
this bullying I'm just saying the park (39:44 - 39:49)
for all kinds of reasons because I like (39:47 - 39:50)
to drink a beer and watch the sunset (39:49 - 39:51)
over the lake even though it's probably (39:50 - 39:53)
facing in the wrong direction I like to (39:51 - 39:54)
drink a beer and watch the sunrise over (39:53 - 39:57)
the lake that's why I go to the park do (39:54 - 39:58)
you know it can you have a beer (39:57 - 40:02)
departmental play I if you cover it in a (39:58 - 40:03)
brown paper bag don't have anything just (40:02 - 40:06)
saying that like if you want to just you (40:03 - 40:07)
know maybe bring down foot traffic (40:06 - 40:10)
traffic you could remove a couple stops (40:07 - 40:11)
but this is going to be a situation (40:10 - 40:12)
where it's all or nothing they're either (40:11 - 40:15)
going to keep all these stops or they're (40:12 - 40:18)
going to remove them all and removing (40:15 - 40:20)
them all is probably the worst option (40:18 - 40:22)
especially because Pokemon go will die (40:20 - 40:25)
down just like everything else does and (40:22 - 40:27)
what happens when it gets super cold out (40:25 - 40:28)
what happened ones one winter comes now (40:27 - 40:31)
this is no longer a problem oh and also (40:28 - 40:34)
yet milwaukee public parks don't come (40:31 - 40:36)
crying to me when you can't get (40:34 - 40:38)
donations and funding for your parts (40:36 - 40:39)
because you can't prove that anybody (40:38 - 40:41)
goes there after you chased everybody (40:39 - 40:43)
away by taking away their polka stops (40:41 - 40:46)
yeah and i'll just say if i sound extra (40:43 - 40:50)
bitter it's because about 14 years ago (40:46 - 40:53)
there was this huge beautiful three day (40:50 - 40:56)
outdoor concert festival like of the (40:53 - 40:58)
european style was one of the first ones (40:56 - 40:59)
that was ever going to happen in the (40:58 - 41:01)
United States there's going to be all (40:59 - 41:02)
the way out on the tip of Long Island (41:01 - 41:05)
man I spent like two hundred dollars on (41:02 - 41:06)
the tickets for that I was going to get (41:05 - 41:09)
a tent camp out everything it was going (41:06 - 41:11)
to be beautiful but you know my morning (41:09 - 41:13)
jacket was going to play all kinds of (41:11 - 41:15)
great bands and everything and they had (41:13 - 41:18)
to cancel the whole thing why because (41:15 - 41:20)
rich person on the end of Long Island (41:18 - 41:22)
said there's a rare bird that nests here (41:20 - 41:24)
and if you have your concert here those (41:22 - 41:25)
rare birds are all going to die and that (41:24 - 41:27)
was a load of baloney so you're just (41:25 - 41:29)
like scratching that itch right there no (41:27 - 41:32)
there's not protecting the natural what (41:29 - 41:34)
natural wildlife of Milwaukee the (41:32 - 41:36)
harley-davidson plant is that your your (41:34 - 41:39)
great preserve because I'll tell you (41:36 - 41:40)
something Michigan's doing a much better (41:39 - 41:42)
job of preserving wildlife with their (41:40 - 41:44)
incredibly boring state than you are (41:42 - 41:46)
Milwaukee I'm not saying Milwaukee's (41:44 - 41:50)
great I'm just giving I'm just giving (41:46 - 41:57)
you the news I'm so angry speaking of (41:50 - 42:00)
news I'll keep you guys updated on the (41:57 - 42:01)
Milwaukee outcome of this I don't know (42:00 - 42:04)
if how soon that will be but speaking of (42:01 - 42:06)
news what we'll do is we'll take a quick (42:04 - 42:08)
break when we come back I want to talk (42:06 - 42:11)
about worlds and the results there and (42:08 - 42:13)
yeah so we'll take a quick break when we (42:11 - 42:14)
come back we'll be talking about some (42:13 - 42:17)
worlds (42:14 - 42:17)
you (42:20 - 42:23)
I (42:23 - 42:25)
and we are back from our break do talk (42:28 - 42:41)
to you about worlds worlds 2016 so I (42:34 - 42:44)
think there was a bit of (42:41 - 42:47)
misunderstanding last week and wanted it (42:44 - 42:51)
I normally don't bring up negative (42:47 - 42:55)
reviews that we have well I have in the (42:51 - 42:58)
past but I wanted to touch on iTunes (42:55 - 43:00)
review here not because it was recent (42:58 - 43:02)
and it was specifically of our last (43:00 - 43:05)
episode before I before I read it or (43:02 - 43:07)
talk about it I do want to say that if (43:05 - 43:10)
you enjoy it's super effective it's (43:07 - 43:11)
something you listen to and you haven't (43:10 - 43:15)
done so already I would highly encourage (43:11 - 43:17)
you to take the time and leave us a (43:15 - 43:19)
review on iTunes even if you don't use (43:17 - 43:22)
itunes itunes is used by most of our (43:19 - 43:25)
listeners and we're trying to get to 700 (43:22 - 43:27)
reviews by the end of the year we're at (43:25 - 43:31)
625 now so you have like five seconds in (43:27 - 43:32)
your day you can either use your (43:31 - 43:34)
computer with itunes on there or if you (43:32 - 43:37)
have an iOS device the podcast app will (43:34 - 43:39)
take you there itunes store or whatever (43:37 - 43:41)
would really really appreciate it (43:39 - 43:43)
because it's free doesn't cost anything (43:41 - 43:46)
and it really helps us out so moist (43:43 - 43:49)
moose left us a review and I I got a (43:46 - 43:52)
first off amazing name yeah super (43:49 - 43:54)
amazing name I want to say that he left (43:52 - 43:57)
us a one-star review and I want to start (43:54 - 44:00)
off saying I appreciate that he took the (43:57 - 44:02)
time and left a reason why he left us (44:00 - 44:04)
one sure review so I wanted to just (44:02 - 44:07)
comment on that and then that'll bring (44:04 - 44:09)
us into our worlds talk because most of (44:07 - 44:13)
it was he or she being upset that we (44:09 - 44:15)
didn't talk about worlds well enough so (44:13 - 44:16)
i'm just going to paraphrase it real (44:15 - 44:19)
quick titled a good podcast ruined by (44:16 - 44:21)
fanboying biased and poor research (44:19 - 44:23)
skills this podcast has a lot of good (44:21 - 44:25)
points but is ruined by the host (44:23 - 44:27)
research fanboying to the point and (44:25 - 44:30)
forgiving every bad mood yet bad move me (44:27 - 44:32)
antic has made and a hundred percent (44:30 - 44:36)
misreporting the state of the 2017 (44:32 - 44:39)
worlds what typing news 2016 but okay (44:36 - 44:40)
because they didn't bother to watch it (44:39 - 44:42)
here are some bullet points compared (44:40 - 44:44)
antic for banning a player for doing (44:42 - 44:46)
well in Pikeville and time gating (44:44 - 44:49)
them and comparing it to weekly resets (44:46 - 44:53)
and MMORPGs to when reporting on the (44:49 - 44:55)
2016 VGC world they said they didn't (44:53 - 44:57)
feel like watching it because it will (44:55 - 44:59)
just be groudon exert eous flash the big (44:57 - 45:03)
six truth is that the core teams that (44:59 - 45:05)
made in stop forward didn't have the big (45:03 - 45:09)
six they it just kind of goes on of what (45:05 - 45:13)
the teams were so the the points I want (45:09 - 45:15)
to make is I thought we were clear and (45:13 - 45:17)
said that we were recording that before (45:15 - 45:20)
the finals so even though the podcast (45:17 - 45:24)
came out after world's ended we didn't (45:20 - 45:27)
know what the final matches were because (45:24 - 45:29)
we recorded it that Sunday morning and I (45:27 - 45:32)
do want to say that I watch every single (45:29 - 45:35)
finals and I've watched them all since (45:32 - 45:39)
2011 so I definitely care about the (45:35 - 45:43)
finals and worlds i will say that I've (45:39 - 45:45)
missed a couple Nationals but I think (45:43 - 45:47)
world is just a bigger deal is more fun (45:45 - 45:49)
to watch but I did watch i watch the (45:47 - 45:52)
opening ceremonies I watched three hours (45:49 - 45:55)
of it after the opening ceremonies I did (45:52 - 45:56)
turn it on saturday watched it for about (45:55 - 45:59)
an hour I'm not going to say that you're (45:56 - 46:01)
wrong I totally didn't feel like (45:59 - 46:03)
watching it there I love a lot of things (46:01 - 46:06)
Pokemon is one of them watching (46:03 - 46:09)
competitive Pokemon all weekend not a (46:06 - 46:13)
love I like it not a love the other (46:09 - 46:15)
thing is we are pretty forgiving of knee (46:13 - 46:17)
antic i think but we are also pretty (46:15 - 46:20)
hard on the antic some episodes are up (46:17 - 46:22)
and some episodes are down but the end (46:20 - 46:24)
of the day it's a free-to-play game so (46:22 - 46:27)
it's hard to hold them to a certain (46:24 - 46:30)
standard when the initial by was zero (46:27 - 46:32)
dollars but I mean I feel like we were (46:30 - 46:35)
we were pretty hard on them today yeah (46:32 - 46:36)
talked about him earlier I think ya (46:35 - 46:39)
think so too I don't play pokemon go (46:36 - 46:41)
that much anymore but like I said I'm (46:39 - 46:44)
going to pee it go into PX going to pax (46:41 - 46:47)
and i PX and i am very excited to place (46:44 - 46:49)
a pokemon go there yeah I think that I (46:47 - 46:52)
think that was the big miss maybe we (46:49 - 46:52)
should made that more clear (46:52 - 46:56)
that we didn't wash the finals prior to (46:52 - 46:57)
recording even though the podcast came (46:56 - 47:01)
out after world was done which was just (46:57 - 47:04)
poor timing but we record every Sunday (47:01 - 47:06)
morning when we were recording you know (47:04 - 47:09)
finals didn't even start for anything I (47:06 - 47:11)
don't think hmm appreciate the review (47:09 - 47:14)
they said they plan on listening to the (47:11 - 47:15)
next episode to see if we addressed his (47:14 - 47:19)
concerns hopefully we did as for being (47:15 - 47:21)
unbiased I mean this is just a podcast (47:19 - 47:24)
of our opinions all this is we all have (47:21 - 47:26)
opinions we all like stuff we all don't (47:24 - 47:28)
like stuff but if you're looking if I (47:26 - 47:30)
and I've said this before I've said this (47:28 - 47:31)
a hundred times if you are looking for (47:30 - 47:33)
competitive information this is not the (47:31 - 47:36)
show for you there are so many awesome (47:33 - 47:40)
youtubers that do that better and I (47:36 - 47:41)
would encourage you to sneak those out (47:40 - 47:42)
if you're looking for competitive stuff (47:41 - 47:44)
if you're looking for soylent (47:42 - 47:47)
information I can really do that the new (47:44 - 47:50)
Soylent bars that came out this is small (47:47 - 47:52)
transition and a healthy living they're (47:50 - 47:54)
very similar to power bars but they (47:52 - 47:56)
taste better they have like the little (47:54 - 47:59)
crisp to them and I like that a lot like (47:56 - 48:01)
a kit kat crisps or rice krispies Chris (47:59 - 48:04)
but not all Chris just a bit of cream (48:01 - 48:06)
what about the new soiling coffee 'used (48:04 - 48:09)
coffee 'used ah I don't like it you know (48:06 - 48:11)
and I don't you not drink coffee that's (48:09 - 48:13)
the thing is I don't drink by a coffee (48:11 - 48:15)
so my friend Alex who only drinks by (48:13 - 48:18)
coffee he said he loved it and I gave it (48:15 - 48:20)
to my friend Tim who he said he only (48:18 - 48:22)
drinks black coffee and tim was super (48:20 - 48:24)
funny because he was very against (48:22 - 48:26)
Soylent he didn't know what it was I was (48:24 - 48:28)
like Ali you know it's def da approves (48:26 - 48:30)
made in the lab you should drink it so I (48:28 - 48:31)
gave him a coffee us cuz he says he (48:30 - 48:33)
drinks black coffee and he told me that (48:31 - 48:35)
he liked it a lot and he was about to (48:33 - 48:37)
order a box and I said hey I got half a (48:35 - 48:40)
box you wanna buy the rest of it don't (48:37 - 48:42)
you keep saying black coffee is it (48:40 - 48:44)
literary black coffee or is it doesn't (48:42 - 48:47)
have like a milk coffee kind of taste to (48:44 - 48:51)
it I don't know if you hit it to me it (48:47 - 48:53)
just tastes like thick black coffee not (48:51 - 48:55)
like super thick I would say like thick (48:53 - 49:00)
like milk like vitamin B or a milk is (48:55 - 49:03)
there a is that right vitamin B now all (49:00 - 49:05)
fortified with vitamin A so there's (49:03 - 49:07)
whole milk (49:05 - 49:11)
no something a little Oh milk two (49:07 - 49:14)
percent one presented live in wisco two (49:11 - 49:19)
per second ABC and D i would so skin is (49:14 - 49:22)
the thinnest milk hole is the thickest (49:19 - 49:26)
milk I would say that Soylent is closer (49:22 - 49:29)
to whole milk and i would say that (49:26 - 49:31)
coffee asst is closer to two percent (49:29 - 49:35)
milk in thickness coffee asst is (49:31 - 49:38)
apparently half coffee half Soylent I (49:35 - 49:41)
don't taste any silent I just taste all (49:38 - 49:44)
black coffee and from what I've read (49:41 - 49:48)
online and from talking to him and alex (49:44 - 49:50)
and another person that only drinks by (49:48 - 49:54)
coffee they loved it and so it's just me (49:50 - 49:55)
I just don't like by coffee and I've (49:54 - 49:57)
tried to like buy coffee and I maybe one (49:55 - 50:00)
day I'll get there but I could drink it (49:57 - 50:01)
I just didn't care I would rat when I (50:00 - 50:03)
was drinking coffee as I was thinking I (50:01 - 50:07)
could just be drinking Soylent because I (50:03 - 50:09)
like so I went better mmm but if you (50:07 - 50:11)
like black coffee and you want a meal in (50:09 - 50:14)
the morning coffee is might be for you (50:11 - 50:16)
except I think they're sold out there (50:14 - 50:20)
you go so yeah but that was your healthy (50:16 - 50:22)
living update let's talk about the world (50:20 - 50:24)
championships so let's just talk about (50:22 - 50:28)
the final match here it was a wolf Glick (50:24 - 50:32)
who has never been world champion but (50:28 - 50:34)
has made it there believe one time (50:32 - 50:36)
before he is national champion three (50:34 - 50:39)
times in a row fun fact I have beaten (50:36 - 50:42)
wolf at the 2011 national championships (50:39 - 50:45)
uh we were waiting in line for some TCG (50:42 - 50:48)
we decided battle I had a drastic real (50:45 - 50:52)
hey what I beat the national champion (50:48 - 50:55)
will with my angle enough with my Durant (50:52 - 50:58)
with my I can't even I can't even (50:55 - 51:00)
remember my whole team I think I had a (50:58 - 51:03)
semi serious i believe i had a bass (51:00 - 51:06)
Glynn I beat wolf we were waiting in (51:03 - 51:08)

my head of bass k'lon I had well this (51:08 - 51:12)
wasn't remember this is only you know of (51:11 - 51:14)
a Pokemon so I was very limited in what (51:12 - 51:17)
I could have bascal and had soaked and (51:14 - 51:20)
my strategy revolved around soaked (51:17 - 51:22)
but I did beat wolf I'm just saying I (51:20 - 51:25)
beat your world champion I guess so (51:22 - 51:30)
Jonathan had a Kyogre and a grout on go (51:25 - 51:34)
figure right Gengar talonflame manectric (51:30 - 51:41)

Kyogre hitmontop ride to bronze on (52:27 - 52:33)
gengar you see I'm reading you guys a (52:30 - 52:36)
pattern like yeah Wolf's Pokemon were (52:33 - 52:39)
not that unique natin and I'm not taking (52:36 - 52:41)
wolf is a great player I'm not taking (52:39 - 52:42)
any credit I'm and Jonathan and that was (52:41 - 52:44)
the first time I've ever seen in battle (52:42 - 52:47)
deemed to make smart decisions another (52:44 - 52:49)
top 8 here cresselia XR Nia's groudon (52:47 - 52:53)
smeargle salamence bronzong infernape (52:49 - 52:56)
sarnia's fungus we've seen fungus almost (52:53 - 52:59)
in every every pop ate here Salim and (52:56 - 53:01)
its its food goes to set him oh I'm (52:59 - 53:04)
sorry Amongus I would be real impressed (53:01 - 53:06)
if he was running to defeat real clutch (53:04 - 53:10)
absolutely I Kyogre bronzong I could (53:06 - 53:12)
just keep going but pretty much all the (53:10 - 53:14)
pokemon on the same after that point did (53:12 - 53:17)
you guys watch the world's match I did (53:14 - 53:20)
not now I missed it I can't remember (53:17 - 53:23)
where oh that's I was in recovery from (53:20 - 53:26)
from running my long run that morning (53:23 - 53:30)
yeah so I miss the final for the VGC but (53:26 - 53:33)
I was I was watching it during (53:30 - 53:35)
I'd it up on my computer at SummerSlam (53:33 - 53:37)
up up my TV it was pre-show SummerSlam (53:35 - 53:39)
so it didn't matter yeah so I watched it (53:37 - 53:42)
and I might get might get a little flack (53:39 - 53:45)
for this but it was probably one of the (53:42 - 53:47)
most boring world's matches I've ever (53:45 - 53:52)
watched hmm and the first game went to (53:47 - 53:55)
time then wolf had more Pokemon though (53:52 - 53:58)
he won and the second game was probably (53:55 - 54:01)
about two minutes less than two minutes (53:58 - 54:04)
i think was a minute 48 when it ended so (54:01 - 54:07)
a minute 48 away from going to time two (54:04 - 54:10)
now I've seen every worlds match since (54:07 - 54:13)
2011 i would say probably the most (54:10 - 54:16)
exciting worlds match for me was 2011 (54:13 - 54:18)
because i was actually there in (54:16 - 54:21)
California at Worlds and that was super (54:18 - 54:25)
exciting when I say that these matches (54:21 - 54:28)
were boring I don't want do you mean (54:25 - 54:31)
that as I'm discrediting these players (54:28 - 54:33)
because they're clearly good players (54:31 - 54:37)
great players excellent players but I (54:33 - 54:41)
think we've all been to a Super Bowl and (54:37 - 54:44)
we've watched a boring super bowl and (54:41 - 54:46)
that doesn't take away from the two (54:44 - 54:50)
teams that made it to a Super Bowl let's (54:46 - 54:51)
not pretend just because it's a super (54:50 - 54:54)
bowl it must be exciting because ah I (54:51 - 54:55)
don't know about you guys the last (54:54 - 54:58)
couple Super Bowls I've watched not that (54:55 - 55:02)
exciting no but I don't get excited (54:58 - 55:05)
about that so I'm not I'm not sports get (55:02 - 55:06)
away at all the only football game I (55:05 - 55:08)
watched a year is the Super Bowl and (55:06 - 55:11)
I've been to some exciting super bowl (55:08 - 55:14)
parties and I've seen people get excited (55:11 - 55:15)
and I think that's the great thing (55:14 - 55:17)
especially when I was with my friend at (55:15 - 55:21)
2011 worlds and a play happened and we (55:17 - 55:23)
saw people cheer he would look at me and (55:21 - 55:26)
go what happened I want I want to know (55:23 - 55:28)
why everyone is cheering and it was such (55:26 - 55:32)
a good experience and a good eye opener (55:28 - 55:36)
to explain why that move was exciting (55:32 - 55:39)
why that move was clutch why that did (55:36 - 55:41)
that why that situation involved (55:39 - 55:45)
cheering and I was watching uh this (55:41 - 55:46)
world (55:45 - 55:48)
and I was in slack we had a channel (55:46 - 55:50)
specifically two worlds and so we're all (55:48 - 55:53)
chatting and I wasn't the only one that (55:50 - 55:55)
was like hey guys is boring and no point (55:53 - 55:57)
in the slacks did somebody go oh my god (55:55 - 56:00)
that move the only part i remember was (55:57 - 56:04)
there was a point where one of one of (56:00 - 56:06)
Jonathan's Pokemon survived a move with (56:04 - 56:09)
like six HP and that was like it was his (56:06 - 56:11)
Ginga i think was his mega kegger if i'm (56:09 - 56:13)
not mistaken and that was like oh yeah I (56:11 - 56:16)
like that was because you want to see (56:13 - 56:18)
well I want to see I want to see them (56:16 - 56:20)
both win a match and I want to see what (56:18 - 56:21)
that final match comes out to ask to me (56:20 - 56:23)
it's always a little disappointing when (56:21 - 56:25)
one person just kind of wipes the other (56:23 - 56:26)
person where it's 2 and 0 like it (56:25 - 56:28)
happened here but that was a moment (56:26 - 56:31)
where like Oh Jonathan's Pokemon (56:28 - 56:33)
survived he can make a comeback and it (56:31 - 56:34)
didn't happen but like that was an (56:33 - 56:36)
exciting moment but over all those (56:34 - 56:38)
matches I was there just okay they were (56:36 - 56:41)
they were Pokemon matches and poke my (56:38 - 56:42)
matches are fun to watch but they they (56:41 - 56:44)
didn't stand out as like wow this was a (56:42 - 56:46)
world's match to remember it was a good (56:44 - 56:51)
match but not not memorable in any way (56:46 - 56:54)
so we get what I would say and then I (56:51 - 56:55)
don't know if I'll be able to express (56:54 - 56:58)
this the right way is the the current (56:55 - 57:01)
meta in the VGC is is what's making it (56:58 - 57:04)
boring just the fact that it really it (57:01 - 57:07)
really is concentrated around a very few (57:04 - 57:09)
Pokemon being the top Pokemon you know (57:07 - 57:11)
and like you know mirroring your (57:09 - 57:13)
experience I was in the room when (57:11 - 57:16)
station Park used pachirisu and one else (57:13 - 57:21)
was so exciting to that was a match that (57:16 - 57:23)
was legendary there was electricity in (57:21 - 57:25)
the room it was absolutely amazing and (57:23 - 57:28)
you know there was that create you know (57:25 - 57:29)
yes that year there was a ton of (57:28 - 57:31)
complaints because it was like genies (57:29 - 57:33)
genies genies everything is genies blah (57:31 - 57:35)
blah blah and you know his small bit of (57:33 - 57:38)
creativity added to the excitement of (57:35 - 57:40)
the match it doesn't take anything away (57:38 - 57:43)
from the players to say that in a boring (57:40 - 57:46)
meta it is really the skilled and (57:43 - 57:48)
advanced players who do well it just (57:46 - 57:50)
doesn't make an enjoyable match to watch (57:48 - 57:53)
it's it almost becomes like watching a (57:50 - 57:57)
chess game if you're not like super (57:53 - 57:59)
knowledgeable about chess history and (57:57 - 58:00)
everything (57:59 - 58:02)
in that case you're just watching yes to (58:00 - 58:04)
really intelligent and skilled people (58:02 - 58:07)
move playing pieces around the board and (58:04 - 58:10)
you're kind of like well sure I'm sure (58:07 - 58:12)
this is great and fantastic but it (58:10 - 58:15)
doesn't light a fire in my heart but (58:12 - 58:18)
when I see like a wide variety of (58:15 - 58:20)
Pokemon and just like really creative (58:18 - 58:22)
tricky things as opposed to people just (58:20 - 58:24)
pushing the meta the way that it is (58:22 - 58:26)
supposed to be pushed and making those (58:24 - 58:29)
right decisions that that becomes a much (58:26 - 58:32)
mix for a much more exciting match let (58:29 - 58:34)
me tell you to any any Pokemon game that (58:32 - 58:37)
goes the time is just slightly (58:34 - 58:40)
disappointing that if there's no out (58:37 - 58:42)
there's no outcome like you won because (58:40 - 58:45)
you had more Pokemon and wolf is a (58:42 - 58:47)
slower player I don't think anyone's (58:45 - 58:49)
going to disagree with that statement (58:47 - 58:51)
like he's a slower player and that's (58:49 - 58:55)
fine that's cool but for a world's match (58:51 - 58:57)
you you always want to kind of see it (58:55 - 58:59)
come down to the wire of like us to (58:57 - 59:03)
verse it's one verse two can can this (58:59 - 59:05)
get turned around or it's 1 verse 1 or (59:03 - 59:08)
it's 2 verse 2 and they're about to do (59:05 - 59:10)
some huge plays and to have that taken (59:08 - 59:12)
away because of time is slightly (59:10 - 59:15)
disappointing absolutely and we've got (59:12 - 59:17)
the bloodlust and we want to see Pokemon (59:15 - 59:21)
faint we want to see blood yeah Annie (59:17 - 59:23)
rated now I'm just kidding uh yeah but (59:21 - 59:26)
that was that was VGC world's congrats (59:23 - 59:29)
to not only masters I also watched the (59:26 - 59:31)
juniors i watch the seniors I'm not (59:29 - 59:32)
gonna lie I thought their matches were (59:31 - 59:36)
more exciting especially this the the (59:32 - 59:40)
seniors if i'm not mistaken uh I'm at (59:36 - 59:44)
it's hard because after like like 12 and (59:40 - 59:45)
under they all look like they're the (59:44 - 59:47)
same age so I can't recall in seniors of (59:45 - 59:51)
the junior but America one and the you (59:47 - 59:52)
could tell that the Japanese kid was (59:51 - 59:54)
just a little bummed out and right away (59:52 - 59:56)
the American kid went over hugged him (59:54 - 59:59)
and shared the spotlight with him and (59:56 - 60:02)
that was just a cool cool moment T of (59:59 - 60:06)
like what a good sport like not throwing (60:02 - 60:10)
in his face like being runner-up two (60:06 - 60:11)
worlds touchin (60:10 - 60:14)
mystic accomplishment and to see like (60:11 - 60:16)
good sportsmanship come out of that (60:14 - 60:18)
especially with such a younger age age (60:16 - 60:21)
division is just very heartwarming to (60:18 - 60:24)
see I don't know if people go back and (60:21 - 60:25)
watch world's I'm sure if you're into (60:24 - 60:26)
the TC if you're into the (60:25 - 60:28)
competitiveness you want to see how (60:26 - 60:31)
those matches unfolded but at the same (60:28 - 60:32)
time the Met is going to change so i'm (60:31 - 60:34)
not sure if there's much of a learning (60:32 - 60:37)
experience from there but i'm sure (60:34 - 60:39)
that's all archived on Twitter YouTube (60:37 - 60:41)
and you can go back and watch it for the (60:39 - 60:45)
for the TCG here talk about the Masters (60:41 - 60:48)
deck the master Division champion who (60:45 - 60:51)
won was shintaro 'i to have lee said (60:48 - 60:54)
that wrong I'm sorry they used a mega (60:51 - 60:59)
mega audino ax deck I'm just I could (60:54 - 61:01)
review the deck list but again the met (60:59 - 61:02)
is going to change its not like making (61:01 - 61:05)
this deck is beneficial to you Shintaro (61:02 - 61:08)
each use mega audino DX deck is the talk (61:05 - 61:10)
of the tournament featuring a mega (61:08 - 61:13)
evolution Pokemon that has garnered very (61:10 - 61:16)
little attention until now mega audino (61:13 - 61:20)
TX magical symphony does 110 damaged (61:16 - 61:22)
enough to take out shame and IX in one (61:20 - 61:25)
attack and most other Pokemon into (61:22 - 61:28)
attacks Pokemon Center lady is important (61:25 - 61:30)
to preventing the same thing from (61:28 - 61:33)
happening to mega audino ax by forcing (61:30 - 61:36)
many pokemon to attack a third time to (61:33 - 61:39)
take it out mega audino IX by the way (61:36 - 61:43)
has 220 HP tantaros innovated deck and (61:39 - 61:45)
masterful play were on full display on (61:43 - 61:48)
his way to his first World Championship (61:45 - 61:53)
so yeah I'm very familiar with j minus x (61:48 - 61:55)
that what that card was still relevant (61:53 - 61:58)
when I was playing I it's a different (61:55 - 62:01)
shame in Dhara when you play this (61:58 - 62:02)
Pokemon from your hand under your bench (62:01 - 62:05)
you may draw up until you have it's kind (62:02 - 62:06)
of similar the old shaymin let you (62:05 - 62:09)
search for pokemon all Shaymin e ex all (62:06 - 62:12)
shaman's have that similar bill ability (62:09 - 62:14)
of like han recycle meant (62:12 - 62:18)
so three mega audino x is for regular (62:14 - 62:24)
Audino exes touche many x's one who px1 (62:18 - 62:28)
migire nuh ex1 cobalion and one appt (62:24 - 62:32)
stone were in his deck and the runner up (62:28 - 62:37)
here greninja doe greninja break (62:32 - 62:40)
greninja two different types of greninja (62:37 - 62:43)
frogadier froakie and for Talan flames (62:40 - 62:45)
not sure how he was getting to talon (62:43 - 62:48)
flames without the other stage ones but (62:45 - 62:50)
i'm sure there's a card for that hey I (62:48 - 62:52)
know I Alan flame has an ability that (62:50 - 62:54)
you don't have to evolve it oh you just (62:52 - 62:59)
play it as a basic the ability of Gale (62:54 - 63:01)
wings if this pokemon is in your hand (62:59 - 63:03)
when you are setting up to play you may (63:01 - 63:07)
put it down as your Active Pokemon there (63:03 - 63:10)
you go Wow and it does 40 damage for one (63:07 - 63:12)
energy and also searches two cards from (63:10 - 63:13)
your deck and puts them into your hand (63:12 - 63:16)
that's super good for one an amazing wow (63:13 - 63:19)
wow that's real good but I guess that (63:16 - 63:20)
also makes your other three useless but (63:19 - 63:22)
the point is to get one of those for in (63:20 - 63:26)
your starting hand yeah but i'm sure the (63:22 - 63:27)
deck has a lot of like discard two cards (63:26 - 63:30)
to do this yeah there you go there's (63:27 - 63:32)
your TCG update there's you or I I (63:30 - 63:34)
didn't catch DZ G's which is is (63:32 - 63:36)
something I would have preferred to (63:34 - 63:38)
watch over i'm i'm a tcgplayer at heart (63:36 - 63:40)
I think that's a more exciting game I (63:38 - 63:43)
have a soft spot for shuffling cards (63:40 - 63:47)
yeah but i didn't i didn't catch those (63:43 - 63:51)
catch those but prior prior to the most (63:47 - 63:55)
of my watching was the TCG after the (63:51 - 63:56)
opening ceremony i flipped it on to the (63:55 - 64:00)
TCG stream and watched about three hours (63:56 - 64:03)
of that so congrats to all those players (64:00 - 64:05)
that one world seniors masters juniors I (64:03 - 64:07)
don't know if you guys have anything (64:05 - 64:09)
else to comment about that not (64:07 - 64:11)
especially now I'm just excited to see (64:09 - 64:12)
what the format is gonna be for next (64:11 - 64:15)
year yeah I really wanted to go back (64:12 - 64:16)
like you guys were talking about the (64:15 - 64:19)
other episode I want it to be just a (64:16 - 64:22)
lowland Pokemon however they want to (64:19 - 64:23)
make that happen but that's the best the (64:22 - 64:25)
time when it's most exciting for me to (64:23 - 64:28)
play when it's just like a small (64:25 - 64:30)
amount of new Pokemon agreed yep (64:28 - 64:33)
speaking of a low in pokemon i know (64:30 - 64:37)
we're running along but Logan we can get (64:33 - 64:39)
your impressions on the lowland pokemon (64:37 - 64:41)
is there just any Pokemon two or three (64:39 - 64:43)
that stood out to you that you're (64:41 - 64:45)
excited for that you're wanting to see (64:43 - 64:47)
more of obviously you're probably very (64:45 - 64:50)
excited for sun and moon oh yeah of (64:47 - 64:53)
course yeah i'm on this podcast ain't I (64:50 - 64:56)
hey um ok so like a little inform (64:53 - 64:59)
exeggutor is super super awesome I'm (64:56 - 65:01)
definitely in that camp of figure that (64:59 - 65:05)
he's amazing I am preternatural II (65:01 - 65:07)
excited about palace and and I also (65:05 - 65:09)
think that it's pronounced palace and (65:07 - 65:10)
because that sounds like the word palace (65:09 - 65:15)
Oh interesting yeah and he's like a big (65:10 - 65:18)
ol castle but I don't know I wait wait (65:15 - 65:19)
wait wait wait step it back I also was (65:18 - 65:22)
thinking that it's kind of palos and (65:19 - 65:24)
because it's also like power which a (65:22 - 65:26)
ghost would have a ghostly pallor oh (65:24 - 65:29)
yeah we're there you go man there's tons (65:26 - 65:31)
of wordplay in here no matter which way (65:29 - 65:34)
you go on that sank hats pokemon but man (65:31 - 65:38)
I hope that I hope that he's good I feel (65:34 - 65:40)
like golurk was really bad and he's got (65:38 - 65:42)
the same typing so it's probably just (65:40 - 65:45)
gonna be the exact same amount bad but I (65:42 - 65:46)
want him to be good I mean he's got (65:45 - 65:48)
stuff where you wear like water can't (65:46 - 65:50)
hurt him right or maybe water can turn (65:48 - 65:54)
right yeah we don't know fully yeah um (65:50 - 65:55)
if you take away that weakness I feel (65:54 - 65:57)
like he'd be competitively viable and (65:55 - 66:02)
all I want is for it just to take a sand (65:57 - 66:04)
castle to a Pokemon a bit that would (66:02 - 66:07)
just be great so mostly I'm excited (66:04 - 66:08)
about palace and so I'm telling you um (66:07 - 66:11)
but I love them all love all the little (66:08 - 66:13)
guys maybe q obviously everybody's fan (66:11 - 66:15)
of that I am too no different than (66:13 - 66:19)
anyone with that mimic you so cute they (66:15 - 66:22)
Oh be where's little baby form below (66:19 - 66:25)
missed an opportunity with we bear I'm (66:22 - 66:27)
telling you man I'm going to play with (66:25 - 66:29)
me on that stuff was a good name and (66:27 - 66:33)
stuff Elizabet ER than beware but we (66:29 - 66:35)
bear would have been the best name so (66:33 - 66:37)
the theory I saw and stuff will and (66:35 - 66:41)
beware is duffels description is that (66:37 - 66:44)
it doesn't want to be hugged or touch (66:41 - 66:46)
mm-hm and when I walls into beware (66:44 - 66:50)
beware is so strong that no it can break (66:46 - 66:54)
trees in half and it can crush things by (66:50 - 66:59)
hugging to it pretty much grows up and (66:54 - 67:01)
since no one has accepted that they (66:59 - 67:05)
shouldn't hug or touch it it has become (67:01 - 67:09)
this vicious machine killing bear with (67:05 - 67:16)
that is beware I like it is another in a (67:09 - 67:19)
line of a long line of Pokemon (67:16 - 67:21)
descriptions where yeah they seem really (67:19 - 67:24)
cute and in the game they're fine but (67:21 - 67:27)
then if you read the description of what (67:24 - 67:29)
they do you're like whoa what is this (67:27 - 67:31)
doing in this children's game this is (67:29 - 67:35)
terrifying they're all I don't know like (67:31 - 67:38)
the like Palace and sucking kids into (67:35 - 67:40)
the into the ocean basically or like it (67:38 - 67:45)
underneath muddy sand just huh there's (67:40 - 67:47)
like a lot of Pokemon that murder (67:45 - 67:56)
children it says there should be uh add (67:47 - 68:02)
them to the list yep well what would (67:56 - 68:05)
have a good transition but what we'll do (68:02 - 68:08)
now is we'll take a break when we come (68:05 - 68:09)

two days ago but i'm pretty sure you (68:40 - 68:43)

the week we'll be back with that give (68:43 - 68:46)

break you guys have probably heard (68:52 - 68:55)
earlier in the episode that we had an (68:53 - 68:58)
interview for you guys so here we are I (68:55 - 69:02)
am sitting down with ophidian I probably (68:58 - 69:04)
said that wrong again I feel bad oh oh (69:02 - 69:06)
don't no worries my friend here I'm (69:04 - 69:07)
gonna give you an even better (69:06 - 69:10)
introduction I am the venomous and vile (69:07 - 69:12)
serpent from the Nile the one and only (69:10 - 69:17)
master ho snake style the Cobra supanova (69:12 - 69:21)
Ophidian it was possibly way better than (69:17 - 69:24)
what I could have done awesome we're (69:21 - 69:26)
glad glad that you were here sitting (69:24 - 69:28)
down we're gonna we're gonna chat a bit (69:26 - 69:31)
about Pokemon about wrestling about a (69:28 - 69:34)
bunch of things before we dive into (69:31 - 69:37)
things you introduced yourself but let's (69:34 - 69:40)
break that down even more you wrestle (69:37 - 69:45)
over at chikara yes sir and you've been (69:40 - 69:49)
doing that since 2007 absolutely I uh I (69:45 - 69:52)
came on board in 2006 and made my (69:49 - 69:56)
professional wrestling debut in 2007 (69:52 - 69:59)
Chikara pro for those that aren't very (69:56 - 70:01)
familiar as I essentially a comic book (69:59 - 70:04)
come to life with the lucha super party (70:01 - 70:08)
everything about our company about (70:04 - 70:10)
chikara is like watching a live action (70:08 - 70:13)
on a book anime cartoon whatever your (70:10 - 70:15)
preference maybe um (70:13 - 70:17)
such colorful and lively characters um (70:15 - 70:20)
take myself for example an (70:17 - 70:23)
anthropomorphic breakdancing ancient (70:20 - 70:27)
Egyptian you can't argue with that I (70:23 - 70:29)
want I have a bunch of wrestling related (70:27 - 70:31)
questions first but i liked i like to (70:29 - 70:33)
open and close with some pokemon stuff (70:31 - 70:35)
just to kind of tie tie everything (70:33 - 70:37)
together and i know you have a pokemon (70:35 - 70:39)
themed promotion that you want to (70:37 - 70:41)
promote and will totally get to that but (70:39 - 70:43)
begin things off do you have a favorite (70:41 - 70:48)
Pokemon well you see uh it's a little (70:43 - 70:49)
difficult right because with each (70:48 - 70:52)
generation that is come and gone you (70:49 - 70:54)
know your favorites tend to change and (70:52 - 70:56)
sometimes you get those updates you know (70:54 - 70:59)
to a Pokemon that uh I kind of makes you (70:56 - 71:02)
change your mind on what you may really (70:59 - 71:06)
like but I've always always always been (71:02 - 71:08)
a huge fan of Hunter there's just (71:06 - 71:10)
something about his look his deviousness (71:08 - 71:14)
that that or that he has that uh I don't (71:10 - 71:17)
think any other Pokemon since has been (71:14 - 71:20)
able to replicate that's awesome and (71:17 - 71:23)
most people jump straight to Ganga but I (71:20 - 71:25)
like that you kept it at hunter hunters (71:23 - 71:27)
often overlooked he's a very cool (71:25 - 71:30)
pokemon hunter has no arms but yet still (71:27 - 71:35)
has hands it's very handy unintended (71:30 - 71:37)
even beyond that I mean even some of the (71:35 - 71:42)
newer generation pokemon you know I'm so (71:37 - 71:44)
psyched that hawlucha exists now and not (71:42 - 71:46)
to say he's my favorite and not by far (71:44 - 71:49)
but look wise it's exciting to see a (71:46 - 71:52)
bird type was a mask thrown on his head (71:49 - 71:54)
yeah hawlucha was one of the pokemon (71:52 - 71:56)
that I definitely got super psyched (71:54 - 71:57)
about and it came like right time right (71:56 - 71:59)
place because that's when I was getting (71:57 - 72:01)
back into wrestling so that was like a (71:59 - 72:03)
double win for me when I encountered (72:01 - 72:06)
that Pokemon wise just before this will (72:03 - 72:09)
kind of tie inch wide try to do some (72:06 - 72:11)
transitions hear you i'm assuming you're (72:09 - 72:14)
on the road a lot yes so pokemon go (72:11 - 72:17)
seems like the game that's best suited (72:14 - 72:19)
to that unless you didn't jump on that (72:17 - 72:22)
bandwagon oh I absolutely did uh I can (72:19 - 72:24)
tell you right now I'm a level 22 (72:22 - 72:29)
trainer and I've seen and call about 95 (72:24 - 72:31)
oh c'mon wow that's awesome it gets a (72:29 - 72:33)
little difficult sometimes because while (72:31 - 72:35)
we do get to travel and we get to see (72:33 - 72:38)
the road um it's hard to catch a Pokemon (72:35 - 72:41)
while you're in a car especially since (72:38 - 72:44)
the updates yeah totally is for being on (72:41 - 72:46)
the road with with other wrestlers and (72:44 - 72:49)
whatnot did they catch that Crais too or (72:46 - 72:52)
is that is that mostly you or has that (72:49 - 72:54)
spread throughout you know the rest of (72:52 - 72:57)
your crew Oh obviously culturally you (72:54 - 72:58)
have a lot of people playing now that (72:57 - 73:01)
aren't traditionally Pokemon fans and I (72:58 - 73:04)
think that's definitely true of the ways (73:01 - 73:07)
infected our locker room you have a lot (73:04 - 73:08)
of people that normally wouldn't play (73:07 - 73:11)
are playing it um just because it is (73:08 - 73:13)
something to do while you're stuck in a (73:11 - 73:15)
car with somebody for six to seven hours (73:13 - 73:19)
at a time or I won't put you on the spot (73:15 - 73:21)
are you are you the Pokemon expert out (73:19 - 73:22)
of the locker room or to somebody (73:21 - 73:25)
surpass you oh so it goes back and forth (73:22 - 73:28)
between myself and worker ant who has (73:25 - 73:30)
been applying to become a Pokemon (73:28 - 73:34)
professor as I he's an avid uh tcgplayer (73:30 - 73:37)
uh-huh that's awesome we both play (73:34 - 73:39)
together although I haven't been able to (73:37 - 73:42)
keep up with the X&Y expansion that has (73:39 - 73:45)
come out um just given the I've been (73:42 - 73:48)
helping my wife board with our business (73:45 - 73:51)
cause a champion we custom-make a (73:48 - 73:54)
professional wrestling gear and that's (73:51 - 73:55)
kind of call to my attention so my (73:54 - 73:58)
ability to play as much hasn't been (73:55 - 74:01)
there but I still do with them out if it (73:58 - 74:03)
was a lot of play against worker ant so (74:01 - 74:05)
yeah I was I was that my listeners know (74:03 - 74:07)

almost three years competitively going (74:07 - 74:11)
to tournaments every single weekend and (74:09 - 74:13)
I can't imagine being on the road like (74:11 - 74:14)

traveling just on Saturdays and Sundays (74:14 - 74:19)

I'm consuming but i will say that you've (74:33 - 74:38)
been able to catch on like release (74:36 - 74:41)

creedon all my own masks um as well as (75:18 - 75:25)
the gear that I wear and she uh creates (75:22 - 75:28)
most of the locker room not all but our (75:25 - 75:30)
say majority about eighty-five percent (75:28 - 75:33)
of the outfits that you might see how (75:30 - 75:36)
much a car show or made by her let me (75:33 - 75:38)
let me back up real quick Cara is your (75:36 - 75:42)
full-time gig yes how many how many days (75:38 - 75:43)
is that is that a five-day-a-week is (75:42 - 75:45)
that a seven day a week is that a (75:43 - 75:47)
two-day week how how much time is that (75:45 - 75:50)
for you so we have a training facility (75:47 - 75:53)
in Northeast Philadelphia called the (75:50 - 75:57)
wrestle factory where I run classes (75:53 - 76:00)
there alongside mike quackenbush who is (75:57 - 76:01)
the head trainer and a few other guys (76:00 - 76:04)
like drew gulak and chuck taylor um (76:01 - 76:07)
Holloway can fire ant and I have classes (76:04 - 76:08)
three to four days a week depending on (76:07 - 76:12)
the week you know if their shows you (76:08 - 76:14)
know big events on the weekend the stuff (76:12 - 76:15)
you know we may have to cancel our class (76:14 - 76:18)
in order to run our offense okay all (76:15 - 76:21)
right so then where does the where does (76:18 - 76:24)
the time fit in for making the outfits (76:21 - 76:28)
is that another day or two a week you're (76:24 - 76:31)
dedicating to that or it so it tends to (76:28 - 76:33)
be where if I teach a class on a monday (76:31 - 76:35)

foremost that is what she does I'm not (76:48 - 76:52)
just with shakarpur but with many other (76:50 - 76:54)
companies that she creates care (76:52 - 76:58)
for anybody from talent and w.e to TNA (76:54 - 77:00)
wearing of honor and around the world (76:58 - 77:03)
and I help out on the days that I can (77:00 - 77:05)
that's really really cool I wanted to (77:03 - 77:07)
kind of stick on the wrestling thing (77:05 - 77:10)
here year you're on the road you're (77:07 - 77:12)
you're making outfits your you teaching (77:10 - 77:15)
new upcoming wrestlers what happens in a (77:12 - 77:19)
situation when you before I asked the (77:15 - 77:21)
question there's no more like hidden (77:19 - 77:23)
side gigs you're doing right those those (77:21 - 77:26)
are here those are album there might be (77:23 - 77:28)
a little side business is slinging (77:26 - 77:30)
pokemon cards on the streets but you (77:28 - 77:31)
know you can't really talk about that a (77:30 - 77:34)
lot the podcast I think understandable I (77:31 - 77:37)
i was i was looking at your your (77:34 - 77:39)
Wikipedia your history your you know (77:37 - 77:41)
your wrestling database you've been hurt (77:39 - 77:42)
before so what happens in a situation (77:41 - 77:46)
when when you're hurt ah man uh it can (77:42 - 77:48)
definitely very I'll give you two (77:46 - 77:50)
examples there was a night in which I (77:48 - 77:54)
broke my jaw and the opening round of a (77:50 - 77:57)
tournament that took place all in one (77:54 - 78:01)
night and I broke my jaw beating my (77:57 - 78:03)
opponent I was doing a 450 off of the (78:01 - 78:05)
top rope and as I was coming down the (78:03 - 78:07)
points of his knees called my jaw and (78:05 - 78:09)
broke it but I still got the three count (78:07 - 78:14)
in that moment huh so visual right there (78:09 - 78:16)
luckily there was enough impact from the (78:14 - 78:18)
rest of my body hitting them that I was (78:16 - 78:21)
able to beat him and I had to go into (78:18 - 78:23)
the second round with a broken jaw kinda (78:21 - 78:26)
just taped up and locked into place and (78:23 - 78:28)
competed in the sacker and I of course (78:26 - 78:31)
lost very quickly but uh you know and (78:28 - 78:34)
there's moments like that where my body (78:31 - 78:36)
can still go despite the fact that I (78:34 - 78:38)
can't really move my mouth whereas in (78:36 - 78:42)
another instance I've torn my MCL and (78:38 - 78:45)
upon Tara my MCL in the ring I dropped (78:42 - 78:46)
immediately I couldn't stand up and (78:45 - 78:49)
luckily that was during a six-man tag (78:46 - 78:52)
where I had two partners to help me out (78:49 - 78:54)
when those moments I roll out of the (78:52 - 78:55)
ring I have to leave immediately I can't (78:54 - 78:58)
even stand I can't get back up and it's (78:55 - 79:01)
it's scary fell was alone in that (78:58 - 79:02)
situation would have been a completely (79:01 - 79:05)
different scenario you know you have to (79:02 - 79:08)
take away something the fans want to see (79:05 - 79:08)
which is (79:08 - 79:11)
you know action in the ring um lucky (79:08 - 79:14)
enough in that moment to have people by (79:11 - 79:15)
my side you know five other participants (79:14 - 79:18)
that go on without me as I rolled out (79:15 - 79:21)
and call up no ball dreading having to (79:18 - 79:23)
find out what was wrong with my leg (79:21 - 79:26)
right right so then recovery time are (79:23 - 79:30)
you just focused on on the recovery or (79:26 - 79:32)
are you still trying to do your other (79:30 - 79:35)
side stuff just do i want to say pay the (79:32 - 79:36)
bills i don't wanna make it seem like (79:35 - 79:39)
dire but i would imagine where that (79:36 - 79:41)
that's the thing you do is wrestle and (79:39 - 79:44)
when you're out you're out absolutely (79:41 - 79:47)
but uh luckily with the way you know (79:44 - 79:51)
social media and uh being a personality (79:47 - 79:54)
has progressed and evolved we can make (79:51 - 79:57)
ends meet beyond professional wrestling (79:54 - 80:00)
right so i have the ability now to (79:57 - 80:02)
garner are following online whether it's (80:00 - 80:04)
through social media you know like a (80:02 - 80:06)
twitter or facebook or things like that (80:04 - 80:09)
or even open up patreon and and create (80:06 - 80:11)
content for something like that and have (80:09 - 80:13)
something that i could provide people (80:11 - 80:16)
well you know willing there want to see (80:13 - 80:20)
it um and of course now as I wasn't (80:16 - 80:22)
always but now the trainer at the (80:20 - 80:26)
wrestle factory um so there's more than (80:22 - 80:28)
for those that are smart enough to thee (80:26 - 80:31)
to the workings and ins and outs of not (80:28 - 80:34)
only being a personality but of (80:31 - 80:35)
professional wrestling there's way more (80:34 - 80:40)
to do and more ways to make ends meet so (80:35 - 80:42)
like for example I have a patreon with (80:40 - 80:43)
with closeted champion which is our (80:42 - 80:46)
company and of course you know being a (80:43 - 80:48)
trainer at the wrestle factory right (80:46 - 80:50)
right you make the mask you wear the (80:48 - 80:52)
mask for our listeners if you haven't (80:50 - 80:55)
checked it out you can well where would (80:52 - 80:57)
be the best place they could see your (80:55 - 80:59)
ring gear and what you look like well of (80:57 - 81:01)
course all my social medias you'll (80:59 - 81:04)
clearly see me on any of it it's all at (81:01 - 81:07)
both fit in Cobra or you can check out (81:04 - 81:09)
closet champion which is at closet (81:07 - 81:11)
champion or closet champion com yeah so (81:09 - 81:14)
take a second because you take a second (81:11 - 81:17)
and look now back to back to you your (81:14 - 81:19)
ring gear is pretty outstanding I would (81:17 - 81:22)
imagine that the mass (81:19 - 81:24)
that you make and or where are probably (81:22 - 81:29)
pretty popular with kids surprisingly my (81:24 - 81:33)
scary face is loved by young children (81:29 - 81:37)
show wise so you do the show you do your (81:33 - 81:40)
matches what is the general response of (81:37 - 81:44)
the fans are are you are you well (81:40 - 81:47)
received are you somebody that kids want (81:44 - 81:48)
to run up to or kids don't want to run (81:47 - 81:51)
up to you how's that play out what I (81:48 - 81:55)
truly love about chikara pro and you (81:51 - 81:56)
know the way the independent wrestling (81:55 - 81:58)
scene works is we're not contracted to (81:56 - 82:00)
any one company so we have the ability (81:58 - 82:02)
to travel and work for other companies (82:00 - 82:03)
and go around the world and perform with (82:02 - 82:04)
whoever wants to hire us we're (82:03 - 82:07)
independent contractors right but you (82:04 - 82:09)
know my home is jakar pro not primarily (82:07 - 82:12)
I work all their events and well now you (82:09 - 82:14)
know you go other places but chakara pro (82:12 - 82:16)
is a family from the environment so we (82:14 - 82:17)
have lots of children have lots of (82:16 - 82:19)
families that come and it's such a (82:17 - 82:22)
positive and great environment and where (82:19 - 82:23)
you have the ability to have kids that (82:22 - 82:25)
feel comfortable and safe enough to come (82:23 - 82:27)
up to you and hang out with you and talk (82:25 - 82:28)
to you I want to see you and take (82:27 - 82:31)
pictures and and um be interactive (82:28 - 82:35)
children like me i would say uh my snake (82:31 - 82:38)
style is very popular amongst all types (82:35 - 82:45)
i want to take that question you know (82:38 - 82:47)
your fans people enjoying you in the (82:45 - 82:49)
ring people coming up buying your stuff (82:47 - 82:53)
i want to flip that 180 and i stalked (82:49 - 82:55)
you twitter and i saw you tweet a lot (82:53 - 82:59)
about SummerSlam I saw you I saw you (82:55 - 83:01)
tweet that you were very excited Dean (82:59 - 83:04)
Ambrose won the WWE Championship it (83:01 - 83:07)
seems like you not only are wrestler but (83:04 - 83:08)
you are a fan of other promotions is (83:07 - 83:13)
that accurate absolutely uh despite what (83:08 - 83:15)
a lot of what I think ends up happening (83:13 - 83:17)
with a lot of not just professional (83:15 - 83:18)
wrestlers but if you're musician if (83:17 - 83:20)
you're an actor if you're if you're (83:18 - 83:22)
moving into your field that you grew up (83:20 - 83:25)
loving and are trying to become active (83:22 - 83:28)
in that scene you tend to become bitter (83:25 - 83:30)
towards what you what you loved about (83:28 - 83:34)
the industry and I've made sure that (83:30 - 83:36)
I've stayed connected and grounded in a (83:34 - 83:39)
way that allows me to still enjoy what (83:36 - 83:41)
others are producing um because without (83:39 - 83:43)
them right without that without being if (83:41 - 83:45)
I can't enjoy the content that others (83:43 - 83:47)
are producing that i myself am not going (83:45 - 83:50)
to produce content that I feel produced (83:47 - 83:52)
content that others will enjoy as well (83:50 - 83:54)
and from if I can't take a step back and (83:52 - 83:56)
look at what's going on and go mad (83:54 - 83:59)
that's fun that's enjoyable that's at (83:56 - 84:01)
the end of the day that's what made me a (83:59 - 84:02)
fan of professional wrestling they're (84:01 - 84:04)
kidding me still loves you know being (84:02 - 84:06)
able to watch SummerSlam or things like (84:04 - 84:09)
that we had we had Xavier woods aka (84:06 - 84:11)
Austin create on about four or five (84:09 - 84:14)
episodes ago and I was I was hesitant to (84:11 - 84:18)
do that interview not because of Austin (84:14 - 84:20)
because i love i love the new day i love (84:18 - 84:22)
Xavier woods and everything I was (84:20 - 84:24)
hesitant because I didn't know how my (84:22 - 84:25)
audience being primarily Pokemon would (84:24 - 84:28)
react to it and it went over super well (84:25 - 84:33)
and I think Austin was very easy-going (84:28 - 84:38)
enough and talked in a way where his (84:33 - 84:41)
main point was sometimes people don't (84:38 - 84:46)
see us us as in wrestlers outside of a (84:41 - 84:47)
box they just go oh you're only a (84:46 - 84:50)
wrestler and they're surprised when that (84:47 - 84:52)
person that could apply to football or (84:50 - 84:54)
sports or musicians i could buy anywhere (84:52 - 84:57)
that oh you only must do this so you (84:54 - 84:59)
only must wrestle and everyone was (84:57 - 85:02)
shocked her like oh austin has like this (84:59 - 85:04)
gaming channel and plays games and he's (85:02 - 85:06)
into pokemon and you obviously clearly (85:04 - 85:08)
into pokemon playing the card game and (85:06 - 85:11)
pokemon go and and knowing hawlucha like (85:08 - 85:13)
that's such a step above all the I mean (85:11 - 85:16)
everyone knows the first 150 foot once (85:13 - 85:18)
you break that that first hundred fifty (85:16 - 85:19)
it's like oh you actually do know (85:18 - 85:22)
something what do you do though outside (85:19 - 85:24)
of wrestling I'm sure there's there's (85:22 - 85:26)
something else where are you well I'm a (85:24 - 85:30)
huge gamer um without a doubt and same (85:26 - 85:33)
in the way that Austin Creed is and I (85:30 - 85:34)
can tell you right now i'm currently (85:33 - 85:37)

I've always been a huge RPG nerd (85:45 - 85:52)

to be able to take stuff like that and (85:52 - 85:56)
take it on the roads we do have a lot of (85:54 - 85:57)
time and a lot of free time even if i'm (85:56 - 85:58)
not saying free time is we don't do (85:57 - 86:01)

to start playing or Final Fantasy 7 um (86:31 - 86:36)
to absolutely love I can't get enough of (86:33 - 86:38)
the Final Fantasy franchise on top of (86:36 - 86:40)
being able to play stuff like like even (86:38 - 86:42)
Pokemon go blub support my poor mom (86:40 - 86:45)
black 2 is currently uh I've take a step (86:42 - 86:49)
back and clear some space on Maya device (86:45 - 86:52)
for it but I will be returning to it (86:49 - 86:54)
once final fantasy 7 is done I would (86:52 - 86:55)
then safely assume you're excited for (86:54 - 87:00)
Final Fantasy 15 yes absolutely I like (86:55 - 87:02)
the open world changes I like the fact (87:00 - 87:05)
that we're going to be able to explore (87:02 - 87:07)
the world in the way that they're (87:05 - 87:09)
presenting to us it's the natural (87:07 - 87:13)
progression for you know the genre we're (87:09 - 87:14)
able to live in the world you know (87:13 - 87:18)
linearly for years but what happens when (87:14 - 87:19)
we don't have that linear path anymore (87:18 - 87:21)
which they completely do you know (87:19 - 87:23)
deviated from one like final fantasy 13 (87:21 - 87:25)
which I was a big fan of but they you (87:23 - 87:27)
know they corrected by final fantasy 13 (87:25 - 87:30)
2 and 13 3 well they allowed you to (87:27 - 87:33)
deviate from that linear path and to (87:30 - 87:35)
have something that feels or looks as if (87:33 - 87:39)
it is completely unlit I'm excited for (87:35 - 87:41)
it give me a role to explore on my own (87:39 - 87:45)
and let me fail miserably speaking of (87:41 - 87:48)
video games and stuff the first time I (87:45 - 87:51)
actually was aware of you and your (87:48 - 87:56)
character was you I might get the the (87:51 - 87:59)
event wrong but I believe it was paxa (87:56 - 88:01)
mania West (87:59 - 88:04)
I'm bomb crew yes that was the first (88:01 - 88:07)
time that I was aware of you and you (88:04 - 88:08)
know they're introducing all the (88:07 - 88:10)
wrestlers and they're all people in the (88:08 - 88:12)
game industry and then you and somebody (88:10 - 88:15)
else came out and you guys started doing (88:12 - 88:18)
backflips and I was like there's no way (88:15 - 88:20)
that's somebody in the game industry (88:18 - 88:21)
like I feel like these guys are real (88:20 - 88:25)
hustlers and and alex navarro of giant (88:21 - 88:27)
bomb we're like these guys are actually (88:25 - 88:30)
real wrestlers what can you lay out that (88:27 - 88:34)
like what how did this happen the packs (88:30 - 88:36)
of mania crew actually this was a pax (88:34 - 88:38)
east was a blast I've never been to a (88:36 - 88:42)
pax event up until that point and I have (88:38 - 88:44)
some connections through kaiju big (88:42 - 88:47)
battel to those guys and cod you big (88:44 - 88:49)
battle is a tokusatsu themed (88:47 - 88:51)
professional wrestling company if you (88:49 - 88:53)
don't remove it took hissatsu is is (88:51 - 88:55)
essentially are the Godzilla Type (88:53 - 88:56)
monsters or if you think of Power (88:55 - 88:58)
Rangers or this you know sentai the (88:56 - 88:59)
villains that exist when they're in (88:58 - 89:01)
their giant forms the monsters in the no (88:59 - 89:05)
suit that's tokusatsu there's a (89:01 - 89:07)
combination of those guys being fans at (89:05 - 89:11)
Saqqara and them also knowing uh some (89:07 - 89:14)
some of the guys from kaiju big battel (89:11 - 89:16)
who were able to get ahold of us for (89:14 - 89:18)
that event as well lucky enough that you (89:16 - 89:21)
know there were fans of Jakara and the (89:18 - 89:23)
right people know how to get ahold of us (89:21 - 89:25)
it was there's a blast and they paid us (89:23 - 89:28)
often out on a battle them in a on stage (89:25 - 89:31)
from the world we walked on stage did I (89:28 - 89:33)
flips and like how about we just give (89:31 - 89:35)
you a lot of cash and you not beat us up (89:33 - 89:38)
all right do you remember that you can (89:35 - 89:40)
uh you can tend to be asking me all you (89:38 - 89:44)
want I'll gladly take your money that (89:40 - 89:47)
event overall though other than you know (89:44 - 89:50)
knowing the the Godzilla like wrestlers (89:47 - 89:53)
were you in connections with the the (89:50 - 89:55)
people from giant bomb or the other (89:53 - 89:56)
people in the gaming industry was that (89:55 - 89:58)
something that you know you hung out (89:56 - 90:00)
with him you talked with them or even to (89:58 - 90:02)
extend that further they wanted you to (90:00 - 90:04)
come back because it seems like this (90:02 - 90:05)
packs of mania thing is never-ending we (90:04 - 90:10)
are uh I hope you know that we're able (90:05 - 90:11)
to come back as they did extend an (90:10 - 90:13)
invitation for (90:11 - 90:16)
as I guess they're getting more involved (90:13 - 90:18)
with packs and are doing something with (90:16 - 90:20)
packs west um but that is not something (90:18 - 90:22)
we're able to do but we're hoping at (90:20 - 90:23)
least when they're back on the East (90:22 - 90:25)
Coast that you know come next year (90:23 - 90:29)
unpacks East habits again that it is a (90:25 - 90:30)
reoccurring thing as they were happy (90:29 - 90:32)
with us they're all I was happy with (90:30 - 90:34)
hanging out with those guys there's my (90:32 - 90:36)
first time meeting all of them and uh as (90:34 - 90:38)
I'm sure you know me to an event like (90:36 - 90:42)
pax's um its massive and uh it's a lot (90:38 - 90:45)
to take in a lot going on around you (90:42 - 90:48)
yeah totally I'd two panels there that (90:45 - 90:50)
day the paxil mania and then the kaiju (90:48 - 90:51)
big battel which is the tokusatsu (90:50 - 90:54)
wrestling company had an event of the (90:51 - 90:57)
day that I helped work as well speaking (90:54 - 90:59)
of events you guys have an event coming (90:57 - 91:01)
up I believe it's called the king of (90:59 - 91:05)
trios yes tell me about this this seems (91:01 - 91:10)
fascinating so king of trios is the (91:05 - 91:12)
largest professional wrestling (91:10 - 91:14)
tournament every single year and I mean (91:12 - 91:16)
largest as in the amount of performers (91:14 - 91:20)
that are on the show sixteen teams of (91:16 - 91:23)
three compete against each other to be (91:20 - 91:25)
called a king of trios and this year (91:23 - 91:28)
maybe even queen of trios as we have our (91:25 - 91:32)
first all-female teams as more than one (91:28 - 91:33)
of multiple female teams in the (91:32 - 91:35)
tournament and their teams from all (91:33 - 91:38)
around the world from Japan from the UK (91:35 - 91:41)
from Mexico from Canada anywhere you can (91:38 - 91:42)
think of that has professional wrestling (91:41 - 91:44)
throughout the years there has been (91:42 - 91:46)
representation in the tournament and (91:44 - 91:49)
that happens over Labor Day weekend this (91:46 - 91:51)
year I'm involved in a tournament as (91:49 - 91:55)
well my trio the Snakepit are battling (91:51 - 91:58)
one of the all-female trios from Japan (91:55 - 92:02)
team j WP I wanted to ask this I forgot (91:58 - 92:04)
a little bit earlier what you just (92:02 - 92:06)
reminded me we look at you can look at a (92:04 - 92:08)
promotion like WWE and they don't women (92:06 - 92:10)
wrestle women men no Russell men but (92:08 - 92:13)
chakara is one of the not the few but is (92:10 - 92:15)
one of the promotions where men can (92:13 - 92:18)
wrestle women or vice versa what are (92:15 - 92:19)
your thoughts on that overall like I've (92:18 - 92:22)
seen you do a couple matches with women (92:19 - 92:23)
competitors and they were they were (92:22 - 92:26)
outstanding but what are your thoughts (92:23 - 92:27)
when when it comes down to that (92:26 - 92:29)
so my experience coming into (92:27 - 92:30)
professional wrestling is a little (92:29 - 92:33)
different from others I was trained (92:30 - 92:36)
originally by lightning mike quackenbush (92:33 - 92:38)
was the founder of Jakara pro claudio (92:36 - 92:41)
castagnoli who is now Cesaro in double (92:38 - 92:45)
w/e and chris hero who is Cassius oh no (92:41 - 92:47)
in NXT if you're familiar with NXT (92:45 - 92:50)
history when some of those guys at a (92:47 - 92:53)
depart sara del rey became one of the (92:50 - 92:55)
other head trainers for the school who (92:53 - 92:58)
is now the assistant head coach or head (92:55 - 93:02)
trainer in NXT so i spent years training (92:58 - 93:06)
with sara del rey and learning a lot of (93:02 - 93:08)
the ins and outs from you know one of (93:06 - 93:11)
the female competitors and in my mind it (93:08 - 93:14)
was never a question as to whether or (93:11 - 93:15)
not you know you can have the (93:14 - 93:17)
inter-gender wrestling or that female (93:15 - 93:20)
competitors are different you know in (93:17 - 93:23)
the ring we're all the same they getting (93:20 - 93:25)
kicked in the face of bore you know (93:23 - 93:27)
punched or slammed around is still the (93:25 - 93:29)
same whether it's a man or woman doing (93:27 - 93:33)
it it still hurts a lot sure and I'm (93:29 - 93:35)
excited to see more and more of it (93:33 - 93:38)
happening around the world it'll never (93:35 - 93:40)
progress farther unless a company like (93:38 - 93:44)
w.e right the big dog unless a day and (93:40 - 93:47)
state it within their I was in their (93:44 - 93:50)
world but it's something that will (93:47 - 93:52)
inevitably happen as companies like (93:50 - 93:55)
chakara the web and international Fowler (93:52 - 93:57)
are known around the world you know (93:55 - 93:58)
we've done towards it UK we've done (93:57 - 94:01)
shows in Japan we've done to a shame in (93:58 - 94:03)
Germany you know as we start to do it (94:01 - 94:04)
and get bigger and bigger and have stuff (94:03 - 94:06)
like king of trios where you have female (94:04 - 94:08)
teams female competitors battling male (94:06 - 94:11)
competitors um it just opens up the (94:08 - 94:13)
possibility for matchups and things that (94:11 - 94:15)
happen that would never exist otherwise (94:13 - 94:18)
you know professional wrestling's all of (94:15 - 94:20)
its at the end of the day it's a (94:18 - 94:23)
performance art right and the more (94:20 - 94:25)
colors we have available to create art (94:23 - 94:28)
with the bigger the picture the better (94:25 - 94:30)
the pictures we may be able to create (94:28 - 94:33)
right so having more competitors having (94:30 - 94:35)
different types of competitors having (94:33 - 94:36)
females of different shapes and sizes (94:35 - 94:39)
and from all different walks of life (94:36 - 94:40)
being able to battle at male competitors (94:39 - 94:42)
as well means that we get to create (94:40 - 94:45)
larger big Ernie maybe even more vibrant (94:42 - 94:49)
art and that's exciting yeah yes that (94:45 - 94:51)
was that was a fantastic explanation (94:49 - 94:54)
going back to king of trios or might (94:51 - 94:56)
there may or may not be a pokemon theme (94:54 - 95:01)
applied to it oh oh yes there is if you (94:56 - 95:03)
out do you want to talk about that (95:01 - 95:06)
before the Pokemon crazy even kicked in (95:03 - 95:07)
Pokemon go I should say it may put one (95:06 - 95:11)
obvious he's always been massive but um (95:07 - 95:13)
earlier in the year you know we slapped (95:11 - 95:16)
a Pokemon seemed to our shows where (95:13 - 95:18)
every time we'd reveal a team we do in (95:16 - 95:20)
the style of the TV show you know who's (95:18 - 95:22)
at Pokemon instead of you who's that (95:20 - 95:25)
trio um and then you'd have it revealed (95:22 - 95:26)
and silip you know silhouette Stalin (95:25 - 95:28)
revealed who the trio's were and we've (95:26 - 95:30)
been doing that for the entire year um (95:28 - 95:33)
as well as doing an event called the (95:30 - 95:36)
Victory Road rally where we're setting (95:33 - 95:39)
up a scavenger hunt at Pokemon gyms (95:36 - 95:44)
around the Easton the city of Easton (95:39 - 95:45)
which is where king of trios is this (95:44 - 95:48)
year to our scavenger hunt with our (95:45 - 95:52)
competitors stationed at these different (95:48 - 95:54)
gyms in order to get the clothes on the (95:52 - 95:56)
one hopes that you battle and take the (95:54 - 95:58)
gym over for whether your valor mystic (95:56 - 96:02)
or instinct go team valor um and that (95:58 - 96:04)

only way you'll know where the gyms are (96:31 - 96:34)
as you'll have to use Pokemon go in (96:33 - 96:37)
order to complete the scavenger hunt to (96:34 - 96:40)
find all seven gyms that we have mapped (96:37 - 96:42)

Pokemon thing why are we doing this or (96:47 - 96:50)
was everyone very cool of like yeah (96:49 - 96:53)
let's do this kind of thing uh it was (96:50 - 96:54)
fun having to a (96:53 - 96:56)
explained as a character on our show (96:54 - 96:58)
named Asher Hatfield who is the (96:56 - 97:02)
old-timey King of Swing he is a an (96:58 - 97:03)
old-timey baseball player like from the (97:02 - 97:07)
early 1900s and despite the fact that it (97:03 - 97:11)
is 2016 the man had no idea I had no (97:07 - 97:15)
concept of Pokemon at all it's great (97:11 - 97:16)
explaining to him how that worked out (97:15 - 97:18)
where guys like myself and worker ant (97:16 - 97:20)
were beyond excited just hoping that we (97:18 - 97:23)
had pokemon theme Pokemon a style (97:20 - 97:24)
t-shirts and I and of course we do I (97:23 - 97:26)
king of trios font this year's in the (97:24 - 97:29)
Pokemon styling mm-hmm and just having (97:26 - 97:30)
all this merchandise now that is a (97:29 - 97:32)
crossover between Shekhar which is (97:30 - 97:34)
obviously what we love is this comic (97:32 - 97:35)
book come to life pro wrestling company (97:34 - 97:37)
and Pokemon you know a video game which (97:35 - 97:39)
is also i know the huge aspect of my (97:37 - 97:41)
life and in work frances while having (97:39 - 97:44)
that crossover just that yeah it warms (97:41 - 97:49)
the cockles of our soul speaking of (97:44 - 97:51)
Pokemon do you have a favorite (97:49 - 97:53)
generation or a favorite game in the (97:51 - 97:56)
series we you said what you said black (97:53 - 97:59)
to earlier as was currently in your D s (97:56 - 98:02)
aya I'm I uh I don't know if this is a (97:59 - 98:04)
touchy subject and I so I'm sorry if it (98:02 - 98:09)
is but I'm a fan of the rom hacks and ok (98:04 - 98:11)
because of this you know emerald and (98:09 - 98:14)
Ruby have a ton of them so flora sky is (98:11 - 98:17)
one of my favorite hacks so I would have (98:14 - 98:20)
to say because uh because of that and I (98:17 - 98:22)
of course like the the the stuff that (98:20 - 98:24)
was introduced and I'm old in ruby (98:22 - 98:27)
sapphire around the gender that (98:24 - 98:29)
generation of Pokemon might have to say (98:27 - 98:31)
that would be it mostly because the (98:29 - 98:33)
hacks that have come out for that those (98:31 - 98:36)
games are been a lot of fun to play ok (98:33 - 98:38)
no that's totally a fair answer I don't (98:36 - 98:41)
sell some some people are not for you (98:38 - 98:45)
know tampering with the og allah der (98:41 - 98:48)
totally is is Pokemon Sun and Moon on (98:45 - 98:49)
your radar have you been following that (98:48 - 98:51)
is is that something you're planning on (98:49 - 98:53)
picking up or maybe you know a little (98:51 - 98:54)
bit later what's what's your stance (98:53 - 98:57)
there I'm absolutely plan on getting it (98:54 - 99:01)
100% as I'm super excited for it I got (98:57 - 99:02)
the play action wise well but not as (99:01 - 99:05)
much as I wanted to because I broke my (99:02 - 99:07)
3d s on the road (99:05 - 99:09)
which is why I'm back to playing pokemon (99:07 - 99:14)
black 2 0 comes full circle sale liquids (99:09 - 99:18)
and uh 3d asses don't get along sure and (99:14 - 99:20)
of course I mean I I just couldn't (99:18 - 99:22)
justify buying another three dias at the (99:20 - 99:24)
time I'm hoping that somebody in my life (99:22 - 99:27)
gets me one without me having to (99:24 - 99:30)
down and get one again but uh I'm super (99:27 - 99:33)
excited for it and come closer to (99:30 - 99:35)
Christmas I'm hoping that another three (99:33 - 99:38)
BS appears in my life yeah that would be (99:35 - 99:41)
that would be quite the gift besides (99:38 - 99:42)
Pokemon you said you were a big gamer (99:41 - 99:45)
what about favorite game just kind of (99:42 - 99:47)
favorite all all-time game is there one (99:45 - 99:49)
that sticks out as a final fantasy 7 is (99:47 - 99:54)
it something else so Allah far classic (99:49 - 99:56)
games go as far as like let's say a pre (99:54 - 100:00)
PlayStation 2 i'm going with a legend of (99:56 - 100:03)
dragoon which is a PlayStation game it (100:00 - 100:06)
was absolutely uh it wasn't a greatest (100:03 - 100:09)
RPG of all time but uh that's no secret (100:06 - 100:11)
that I've got dragon tattoos on my arms (100:09 - 100:17)
uh and also mortal kombat tattoos on my (100:11 - 100:20)
back which is the another story for (100:17 - 100:23)
another time i guess they had legend of (100:20 - 100:25)
dragoon is without a doubt my favorite (100:23 - 100:28)
game from that generation there's just (100:25 - 100:30)
something about it i've been able to go (100:28 - 100:32)
back and replay and the the fighting (100:30 - 100:34)
system they introduced where it was (100:32 - 100:37)
timed attacks where you can run up no (100:34 - 100:38)
attack and if you hit the button at the (100:37 - 100:41)
right time you can combo and keep (100:38 - 100:43)
calling him for an RPG that was and they (100:41 - 100:45)
did they'd massive that technique so (100:43 - 100:46)
well for an RPG to have that (100:45 - 100:48)
interactivity in a time based RPG was (100:46 - 100:50)
mind boggling to it young me I was (100:48 - 100:53)
hooked on in a circle back and play but (100:50 - 100:56)
now currently more combat 10 beat out (100:53 - 100:58)
mass the mass effect franchise by just a (100:56 - 101:01)
little bit um Mortal Kombat ten just so (100:58 - 101:04)
smooth it's got its flaws but I don't (101:01 - 101:08)
care yeah all I can I can do it can be (101:04 - 101:10)
as flawed as it wants to be I don't (101:08 - 101:14)
that's so good that's awesome but before (101:10 - 101:17)
we wrap up break that question down a (101:14 - 101:19)
little bit further is there a favorite (101:17 - 101:21)
console that you have out of (101:19 - 101:24)
all of them who I would probably have to (101:21 - 101:27)
go play station um the original yes um (101:24 - 101:31)
just for the library games and part of (101:27 - 101:33)
its probably nostalgic because of course (101:31 - 101:35)
I mean like gaming has only gotten (101:33 - 101:37)
better over the years but there's just (101:35 - 101:39)
their games from that console that I (101:37 - 101:41)
could still go back and play to this to (101:39 - 101:43)
this day I mean despite I mean I've you (101:41 - 101:45)
know I've had everything from a Nintendo (101:43 - 101:49)

podcast but that's just me both idian (105:44 - 105:49)
picked a lamp it which is the evolution (105:47 - 105:54)
of lit wick also the pre evolution to (105:49 - 105:56)
one of our favorites here Chandelure (105:54 - 106:01)
yeah not right off the bat this lamp it (105:56 - 106:04)
fit into like a little cup or you (106:01 - 106:06)
probably wouldn't use them in a normal (106:04 - 106:08)
tournament but what were you talking (106:06 - 106:10)
about on our break was what if there was (106:08 - 106:12)
like a tournament where you could only (106:10 - 106:15)
use middle stage pokemon some kind of (106:12 - 106:20)
middle cup yeah like Metapod Wartortle (106:15 - 106:24)
Ivysaur lamp it (106:20 - 106:26)
the middle form of her unique list that (106:24 - 106:30)
I can never remember delusion do you Jin (106:26 - 106:33)
duo's in you know that that would (106:30 - 106:35)
actually be a great tournament because (106:33 - 106:39)
like the middle stages get no love on (106:35 - 106:42)
any Pokemon really well you have a (106:39 - 106:44)
little stage that you really really (106:42 - 106:46)
identify with (106:44 - 106:50)
I can't think of one (106:46 - 106:53)
Egypt kadabra sure Pikachu's is (106:50 - 106:57)
technically a middle stage yeah Kadabra (106:53 - 106:59)
I would I could I could feel like I (106:57 - 107:02)
alakazam just way cooler though right (106:59 - 107:05)
yeah there are the most of the time (107:02 - 107:07)
there are awkward teens that's their the (107:05 - 107:10)
honker teen version of pokemon like show (107:07 - 107:13)
keep a joke is okay yeah yeah Mitch's (107:10 - 107:15)
list he looks less awkward than Machamp (107:13 - 107:17)
I'm gonna go ahead the chimp has four (107:15 - 107:20)
arms though how can I you that's that's (107:17 - 107:27)
money what's better than two arms boy ah (107:20 - 107:30)
let me read us a Logan will have a move (107:27 - 107:31)
said here let me read something about (107:30 - 107:35)
lamp it Levitt can sense when somebody (107:31 - 107:39)
is about to die boom it visits and (107:35 - 107:41)
steals the spirits from the person's (107:39 - 107:45)
body through most often found in deep (107:41 - 107:48)
force it wanders through cities and (107:45 - 107:51)
hangs around near hospitals to absorb (107:48 - 107:54)
the spirits of fallen it uses the (107:51 - 107:58)
spirits it absorbs to fuel its fire on (107:54 - 108:00)
occasion it has been known to work with (107:58 - 108:03)
lit wick to lead people to the Ghost (108:00 - 108:08)
World while stealing life energy (108:03 - 108:08)
I don't know why I decided to do that (108:12 - 108:19)
voice but I know dad spooky music in the (108:15 - 108:21)
back i thought about it uh yeah lamp (108:19 - 108:23)
it's terrifying yeah it's another (108:21 - 108:27)
pleasant for children pokemon right also (108:23 - 108:30)
the ghost world I'm assuming that's not (108:27 - 108:33)
the same as the distortion world it is (108:30 - 108:36)
the land of wind and spirits you should (108:33 - 108:39)
be well familiar with that should I (108:36 - 108:41)
mm-hmm have you never seen mr. sparkle (108:39 - 108:46)
ax know that what you are the biggest (108:41 - 108:49)
Simpsons man in the whole world stone (108:46 - 108:52)
mr. sparkle I shall banish you to the (108:49 - 108:58)
land of wind and spirits yeah yeah wow I (108:52 - 109:01)
am familiar with mr. sparkle I am (108:58 - 109:04)
floored no not get that immediately (109:01 - 109:10)
you're very lucky dishes miss you six (109:04 - 109:10)
apart always gets me um lamp it is a (109:10 - 109:20)
Pokemon her alleged yeah yeah ghost (109:15 - 109:23)
pokemon a ghost fire pokemon to be exact (109:20 - 109:26)
Logan what's your move set for the (109:23 - 109:29)
middle cup I feel like we need a better (109:26 - 109:31)
name than middle cup now middle cups (109:29 - 109:33)
good man was like little cup what about (109:31 - 109:37)
the teenage no that's just not better (109:33 - 109:42)
all right you got me there okay so (109:37 - 109:46)
middle cup a lamp it can learn trick (109:42 - 109:49)
room just like Chandelure is a big (109:46 - 109:52)
brother um and probably gonna partly (109:49 - 109:54)
using mana on a trick room team and (109:52 - 109:56)
although he's still got real good stats (109:54 - 110:01)
um I mean I honestly I don't know what (109:56 - 110:04)
the the range is on middle evolutions (110:01 - 110:06)
but I know his grown-up form has really (110:04 - 110:09)
really great special attack and 95 still (110:06 - 110:12)
seems pretty legit for a mil sage we're (110:09 - 110:14)
gonna you can go with a trick room (110:12 - 110:16)
that's fine he also learns will-o-wisp (110:14 - 110:18)
and willow wisp is good and no matter (110:16 - 110:20)
what cup you're in she can get somebody (110:18 - 110:25)
burned we can give him shadow ball (110:20 - 110:27)
yeah you learned that real real nice (110:25 - 110:29)
stabby ghost move that'll take advantage (110:27 - 110:32)
of his special attack um probably the (110:29 - 110:35)
best will it goes move that you can use (110:32 - 110:38)
hundred accuracy 80 damage yeah it's (110:35 - 110:40)
it's a really solid move oh yeah shadow (110:38 - 110:44)
balls real popular mm-hmm um he's you (110:40 - 110:46)
know like you if you don't want to go (110:44 - 110:48)
with substitute he's got you can have (110:46 - 110:51)
like in paradise since you're going with (110:48 - 110:56)
um really like focus our attack a (110:51 - 110:58)
special attacks focused build you (110:56 - 110:59)
probably wanna give him a choice scarf (110:58 - 111:01)
because he pretty speedy but he needs (110:59 - 111:03)
help getting up there actually is he (111:01 - 111:06)
nice 55 speed okay so you if you give (111:03 - 111:09)
them the choice car pure your banking (111:06 - 111:10)
I'm going first if you give him trick (111:09 - 111:11)
room by the way you probably wanna give (111:10 - 111:13)
them a focus sash so you just guaranteed (111:11 - 111:15)
to get trick room off and that means (111:13 - 111:17)
your team is gonna be slow guys which is (111:15 - 111:21)
probably pretty cool for a teenage cup (111:17 - 111:23)
um but I think I definitely go with (111:21 - 111:26)
will-o'-wisp let's go ahead and build (111:23 - 111:29)
the trick room give them Shadow Ball and (111:26 - 111:31)
higher tank movie and now has about heat (111:29 - 111:34)
wave as an egg move heat wave it's you (111:31 - 111:36)
both opponents fire type moves stab it (111:34 - 111:38)
up that's very true it's it's another (111:36 - 111:40)
stab move it can take advantage of his (111:38 - 111:42)
other type so yeah he wave is a good one (111:40 - 111:44)
ten percent chance of burn boom so (111:42 - 111:46)
you're gonna burn them all up with (111:44 - 111:49)
willow wisp in heat wave yeah you Gavin (111:46 - 111:50)
that's a pretty that's a pretty solid (111:49 - 111:52)
build I really want this teenage cup to (111:50 - 111:54)
heaven now you could probably substitute (111:52 - 111:56)
out I mean if you want if you're more of (111:54 - 111:57)
a defensive player you can probably (111:56 - 111:59)
substitute out will-o'-wisp for like (111:57 - 112:01)
protect so you still have your trick (111:59 - 112:02)
room you have your protective and you (112:01 - 112:06)
have either shadow ball or whatever fire (112:02 - 112:08)
type move you want heat wave Fire Blast (112:06 - 112:11)
flamethrower if you're gonna add protect (112:08 - 112:13)
I wouldn't take away will-o-wisp for it (112:11 - 112:15)
because willow is gets even better if (112:13 - 112:18)
you have protect in addition okay let (112:15 - 112:20)
block and get extra damage then maybe (112:18 - 112:22)
take away the fire type move just keep (112:20 - 112:24)
the Shadow Ball yeah I don't know i mean (112:22 - 112:26)
i guess it's it's a how you want to play (112:24 - 112:29)
it yeah it also depends on what's more (112:26 - 112:30)
popular in the meta you know if you're (112:29 - 112:32)
seeing lots of psychic and other ghost (112:30 - 112:33)
types out there then you want the Shadow (112:32 - 112:37)
Ball you're seeing a lot of grass insect (112:33 - 112:38)
insect Wow (112:37 - 112:43)
oh my brain insect I dried grass bug ice (112:38 - 112:45)
if that's something that's big then (112:43 - 112:46)
you're going to want that heat wave I (112:45 - 112:49)
mean honestly keeping both moves is (112:46 - 112:52)
pretty pretty solid so maybe you want (112:49 - 112:55)
either will-o'-wisp or trick room but (112:52 - 112:58)
maybe not both I don't know I don't know (112:55 - 113:00)
if you're doing will Louis you probably (112:58 - 113:03)
don't want to do flame body slam body (113:00 - 113:05)
gives thirty percent pants of burn if (113:03 - 113:08)
they make physical contact with you Ray (113:05 - 113:11)
so you probably want to go with flash (113:08 - 113:13)
fire (113:11 - 113:16)
yeah flash fire yeah definitely (113:13 - 113:16)
traitor I guess could be a thing but (113:16 - 113:22)
oh yeah we're talking about a middles (113:20 - 113:25)
cup which has like no like I don't know (113:22 - 113:26)
what would the threat what the threats (113:25 - 113:31)
would be with like a reflector aura (113:26 - 113:35)
barrier yeah um (113:31 - 113:37)
infiltrator would allow for a willow (113:35 - 113:39)
wisp to burn if somebody's put up a (113:37 - 113:42)
safeguard to prevent status moves yeah (113:39 - 113:45)
interesting if you get a shiny lamp it (113:42 - 113:50)
it has a purple glow instead of a blue (113:45 - 113:54)
glow it also has blue eyes instead of (113:50 - 113:57)
yellow eyes which is a nice touch lamp (113:54 - 114:00)
it represents October and the you Nova (113:57 - 114:03)
horoscope I had no clue there was a you (114:00 - 114:06)
Nova horoscope in generation five lamp (114:03 - 114:08)
it and its evolutionary relatives have (114:06 - 114:11)
shadow tag instead of infiltrator as (114:08 - 114:13)
their hidden ability however they cannot (114:11 - 114:15)
obtain their hidden ability in these (114:13 - 114:20)
games and lamp it is based on an oil (114:15 - 114:22)
street lamp which i think is obvious (114:20 - 114:28)
when you look at them yeah kind of (114:22 - 114:30)
assuming you have that vernacular of (114:28 - 114:32)
what an oil lamp on the street looks (114:30 - 114:34)
like then yeah he looks just like it (114:32 - 114:36)
alright let's talk about horoscope here (114:34 - 114:39)
Logan when were you born what's the (114:36 - 114:44)
