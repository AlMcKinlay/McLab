my luck will never be this good in (2:27 - 2:31)
masters ever stop playing that i'm done (2:28 - 2:33)
where it's like i killed seven with one (2:31 - 2:37)
blow yeah that fairy tale yeah i oh like (2:33 - 2:38)
go to twitter (2:37 - 2:40)
i posted the screenshots because you (2:38 - 2:42)
people were going to believe me (2:40 - 2:44)
in destiny there's like an achievement (2:42 - 2:47)
to get like seven kills no like (2:44 - 2:50)
there is a literal fairy tale about (2:47 - 2:53)
somebody who like swatted seven flies (2:50 - 2:54)
and killed them all at once and was (2:53 - 2:56)
bragging about how he killed seven with (2:54 - 2:58)
one blow and was going off and he's like (2:56 - 3:00)
well i can take down giants now because (2:58 - 3:02)
i killed seven with one blow (3:00 - 3:05)
it's like a hundreds year old story (3:02 - 3:06)
brave little taylor (3:05 - 3:09)
that's the one i think i did a disney (3:06 - 3:11)
interpretation of it or something (3:09 - 3:14)
authentic will is here i there's no (3:11 - 3:16)
authenticity here i (3:14 - 3:18)
you're just praying about authentic (3:16 - 3:20)
because you got it right said possibly (3:18 - 3:21)
the most defensive thing i've ever heard (3:20 - 3:23)
greg say just right before we hit the (3:21 - 3:25)
record button on this program (3:23 - 3:28)
no i've said it like the ford bronco (3:25 - 3:32)
yeah sure that's the part that (3:28 - 3:32)
okay (3:34 - 3:38)
uh but my true lack of authenticity was (3:34 - 3:40)
my realizing (3:38 - 3:43)
living cognitive dissonance of watching (3:40 - 3:45)
tick tocks of people telling me how to (3:43 - 3:47)
live my best life while i'm eating a (3:45 - 3:49)
double bowl of ramen noodles (3:47 - 3:52)
that is your best one (3:49 - 3:54)
you don't need tick tock stars (3:52 - 3:57)
you know what my most hated tik tok ones (3:54 - 3:58)
are (3:57 - 3:59)
which ones (3:58 - 4:02)
the people who stop and say hey (3:59 - 4:04)
oh i just want you to know you're you're (4:02 - 4:06)
great and i'm like you don't i could be (4:04 - 4:07)
hitler (4:06 - 4:10)
i'm out you don't know me you don't know (4:07 - 4:11)
what i'm doing (4:10 - 4:14)
the ones that are like they just stop (4:11 - 4:16)
you to ask you a question i hate those (4:14 - 4:19)
two like those are the worst i don't (4:16 - 4:21)
like as bad as the affirmation ones i (4:19 - 4:23)
hate i definitely don't like prank tic (4:21 - 4:26)
tocs i think they're very like yes using (4:23 - 4:28)
other people in the world to get comedy (4:26 - 4:31)
without their consent is is not great i (4:28 - 4:34)
just don't like the whole like (4:31 - 4:34)
approaching other people just to like (4:35 - 4:41)
the like what are you listening to kind (4:39 - 4:42)
of thing i don't know that stuff just is (4:41 - 4:45)
not interesting to me at all i i don't (4:42 - 4:47)
know what tick tock you guys are on (4:45 - 4:50)
because literally all i get is politics (4:47 - 4:53)
politics politics politics and like (4:50 - 4:55)
everything that i need to be outraged (4:53 - 4:59)
about i i you i used to get a lot of (4:55 - 5:01)
politics and then the two craters that (4:59 - 5:03)
had the dust up i blocked both of them (5:01 - 5:05)
because i'm like i'm out of all of this (5:03 - 5:08)
and my politics stuff has dropped to (5:05 - 5:10)
almost none yeah i have specifically one (5:08 - 5:12)
politics person i have one car person i (5:10 - 5:14)
don't want anyone else's i don't want (5:12 - 5:16)

a bunch of pokemon tick tock (5:24 - 5:30)
and then i get a lot of adhd tick tock (5:27 - 5:31)
which i can only watch (5:30 - 5:33)
so i can understand my husband because (5:31 - 5:35)
i'm like none of this applies to me but (5:33 - 5:37)
i bet this is what brent goes through (5:35 - 5:39)
and then i send it to brent and then he (5:37 - 5:40)
gets mad at me (5:39 - 5:42)
because it's accurate and then he sends (5:40 - 5:45)
me dogs (5:42 - 5:45)
and i send will cat tick tocks but he (5:45 - 5:48)
blocks me (5:47 - 5:51)
yeah correct you're bad for animals i'm (5:48 - 5:54)
on skunks squirrel oh obviously talk is (5:51 - 5:56)
good skunk tick tock and squirrel tick (5:54 - 5:58)
tock are these (5:56 - 6:01)
no i was on frog tik tok for like two (5:58 - 6:03)
seconds (6:01 - 6:04)
and (6:03 - 6:05)
for (6:04 - 6:08)
one hour i was on gay star wars (6:05 - 6:09)
tick-tock and then it disappeared and (6:08 - 6:11)
i've never gotten back there and i'm (6:09 - 6:13)
very sad i was on magic tic-tock for a (6:11 - 6:16)
little bit and then i was on revealing (6:13 - 6:17)
the magic tick tock which was much (6:16 - 6:20)
better than the magic tic-tac (6:17 - 6:21)
mine is magic the gathering not magic (6:20 - 6:23)
the tricks (6:21 - 6:25)
no no i really like the let me break (6:23 - 6:27)
down how this magic trick works that's (6:25 - 6:30)
that's good magic for me was destroyed i (6:27 - 6:33)
saw penn teller in (6:30 - 6:35)
las vegas and they were doing a trick (6:33 - 6:37)
and i literally saw them (6:35 - 6:40)
toss the cell phone that they had (6:37 - 6:43)
i wasn't supposed to see them do it but (6:40 - 6:46)
they threw it up and over the background (6:43 - 6:48)
so that their assistant could manipulate (6:46 - 6:49)
it into whatever location it was (6:48 - 6:50)
supposed to show up and i was like oh (6:49 - 6:51)
well (6:50 - 6:53)
magic's not real (6:51 - 6:55)
magic's not real anyway no magic magic (6:53 - 6:58)
wasn't real as soon as niantic decided (6:55 - 7:00)
harry potter was stunned (6:58 - 7:02)
they killed they went out the real world (7:00 - 7:04)
and killed all magic i will tell you (7:02 - 7:06)
what like i will immediately click on (7:04 - 7:08)
i'm not interested in this ticket i (7:06 - 7:10)
don't think that button works it does it (7:08 - 7:12)
does because every time i see any kind (7:10 - 7:14)
of pokemon anything i'm not interested (7:12 - 7:16)
in this and i i don't get pokemon stuff (7:14 - 7:18)
at all no i have been clicking on i am (7:16 - 7:21)
not interested for lego and lego tick (7:18 - 7:23)
tock for a year now and i'm still (7:21 - 7:25)
getting lego tick-tock i've never gotten (7:23 - 7:29)
lego tick-tock and i follow al (7:25 - 7:31)
i i have never even i know that al has (7:29 - 7:33)
like a one million views yeah like (7:31 - 7:35)
watching attack thing but i was getting (7:33 - 7:37)
lego tick-tock well before that and i'm (7:35 - 7:39)
still not interested not interested i (7:37 - 7:40)
mean i look i (7:39 - 7:44)
like legos as a kid as as everyone does (7:40 - 7:47)
uh my parents were very cheap i never (7:44 - 7:50)
got actual legos i got like the knockoff (7:47 - 7:52)
mega blocks which are not nearly as good (7:50 - 7:54)
as good (7:52 - 7:58)
um and then at a certain point i decided (7:54 - 8:00)
do i want to continue this hobby that is (7:58 - 8:02)
very expensive (8:00 - 8:04)
and i was like (8:02 - 8:06)
17 18 and i was like no i'm gonna put my (8:04 - 8:08)
money more towards video games than (8:06 - 8:11)
legos and here we are yeah (8:08 - 8:12)
i just want to say the millennials (8:11 - 8:15)
ruined like yeah because when greg and i (8:12 - 8:16)
were kids (8:15 - 8:19)
lego meant you got a bucket of random (8:16 - 8:20)
crap (8:19 - 8:22)
and you made stuff out of it and now (8:20 - 8:23)
it's all these like (8:22 - 8:26)
kits like the star wars lego oh yeah (8:23 - 8:28)
yeah yeah i love totally (8:26 - 8:30)
i want a bucket of crap that i can build (8:28 - 8:31)
a house i mean (8:30 - 8:33)
if you take apart all the kits that (8:31 - 8:36)
becomes a bucket of crap i had a friend (8:33 - 8:39)
who dated a professional (8:36 - 8:42)
lego stylist like was hired to go to (8:39 - 8:45)
places to do major in art instead there (8:42 - 8:46)
was a lot of words there that i liked (8:45 - 8:49)
professional lego stylist i think that's (8:46 - 8:51)
what you said yeah (8:49 - 8:53)
well artist i don't know i don't know (8:51 - 8:54)
what the official term was but alex (8:53 - 8:56)
stylist would go (8:54 - 8:57)
like (8:56 - 8:59)
build (8:57 - 9:01)
like the giant like (8:59 - 9:03)
we need a replica of the empire state (9:01 - 9:06)
building he could go do that (9:03 - 9:09)
and wood was hired all over the country (9:06 - 9:11)
look i think the lego store in mall (9:09 - 9:13)
america is cool (9:11 - 9:16)
but there there's there is very little (9:13 - 9:17)
desire (9:16 - 9:20)
for me to ever purchase a lego again (9:17 - 9:24)
i purchased some things every when my (9:20 - 9:27)
when it tickles my fancy (9:24 - 9:27)
speaking of (9:28 - 9:33)
tickling we have some pokemon news today (9:29 - 9:35)

this is like prime mobile (10:21 - 10:24)
serial (10:23 - 10:27)

but they could be making millions off of (10:27 - 10:32)
micro transactions unlock squirtle for a (10:29 - 10:34)
dollar fifty i think they already made (10:32 - 10:37)
those millions off of shuffle (10:34 - 10:40)

i mean i the pinball machine got its (14:45 - 14:49)
mileage it made it to (14:47 - 14:51)
four or five five midwest gaming (14:49 - 14:54)
classics i mean the the wood (14:51 - 14:56)

work of art (15:04 - 15:06)
like all art it must fade into dust yeah (15:08 - 15:13)
yeah yeah (15:11 - 15:15)
um (15:13 - 15:18)
pokemons this is off polygon.com (15:15 - 15:20)
pokemon's life-size spiel plush is my (15:18 - 15:23)
new best friend that's the title of this (15:20 - 15:24)
article look they're making a giant (15:23 - 15:26)
life-sized (15:24 - 15:28)
feel i don't know (15:26 - 15:30)
if it's sadder that we're covering this (15:28 - 15:33)
as a news item or the fact that polygon (15:30 - 15:35)
covered this as a news look polygon (15:33 - 15:39)
needs clicks and spheel gets clicks i (15:35 - 15:41)
guess (15:39 - 15:43)
it's very round (15:41 - 15:45)
the right is very round there was like a (15:43 - 15:47)
point (15:45 - 15:51)
i feel like especially in our podcasting (15:47 - 15:52)
era (15:51 - 15:54)
this is still our podcasting era where (15:52 - 15:57)
we didn't talk about life-size plushes (15:54 - 15:59)
and i remember when a couple of them (15:57 - 16:01)
started coming out it was like oh that's (15:59 - 16:05)
novel like 350 for a huge pikachu and (16:01 - 16:08)
now i feel like one comes out a month (16:05 - 16:11)
like like there is some market (16:08 - 16:16)
of i i look i have i have a big appleton (16:11 - 16:17)
that was like 85 bucks (16:16 - 16:20)
and i was gifted a giant long meowth (16:17 - 16:24)
which i think was like normally 300 (16:20 - 16:26)
uh and you also have the huge leak which (16:24 - 16:28)
doesn't even have a pokemon with it it's (16:26 - 16:30)
just true the leak is only like 35. (16:28 - 16:33)
but there are some people (16:30 - 16:35)
i don't know maybe their name is real (16:33 - 16:39)
breaking nate who has like all of them (16:35 - 16:41)
we're gonna call out a person i love (16:39 - 16:42)
nate um (16:41 - 16:46)
and i know that nate and i'm sure other (16:42 - 16:47)
content creators and i'm sure other just (16:46 - 16:50)
pokemon fans are gonna buy this feel but (16:47 - 16:53)
all i think at a certain point as an (16:50 - 16:55)
owner of a giant meowth plush (16:53 - 16:58)
is there is no enjoyment in these there (16:55 - 17:02)
is just you are paying to make your room (16:58 - 17:06)
that it exists in smaller correct (17:02 - 17:08)
that is the enjoyment you don't own your (17:06 - 17:10)
possessions your possessions own you (17:08 - 17:12)
around a round (17:10 - 17:13)
friend (17:12 - 17:15)
sitting in the corner that you can look (17:13 - 17:17)
at and say (17:15 - 17:20)
at last my decor is here i don't have to (17:17 - 17:22)
worry about that empty space and the (17:20 - 17:24)
demons and gremlins that could inhabit (17:22 - 17:25)
that space (17:24 - 17:27)
i think i've come full circle of will (17:25 - 17:30)
moving me from milwaukee to minneapolis (17:27 - 17:36)
and being like i have too much junk (17:30 - 17:36)

things (18:22 - 18:26)
to buy something that would fit into (18:23 - 18:29)
whatever current standard is because i'm (18:26 - 18:32)
doing one max raid battle event at gen (18:29 - 18:33)

resetting (22:33 - 22:37)
the same day very close to the same day (22:35 - 22:38)
or (22:37 - 22:40)

i mean if you don't care about the (28:49 - 28:51)
serena you don't have to go all the way (28:50 - 28:53)
to 12 but you can you get a free hollow (28:51 - 28:55)
wear at the end of it but you get a lot (28:53 - 28:57)
of good rewards for doing it it can be (28:55 - 28:59)
done in any of the battle types as long (28:57 - 29:01)
as you win (28:59 - 29:04)
and it gets you to try all like because (29:01 - 29:07)
they have a selection of all the types (29:04 - 29:09)
i'm like this is actually kind of very (29:07 - 29:12)
cool (29:09 - 29:12)
yeah i i've always thought (29:13 - 29:17)
like (29:15 - 29:19)
i think (29:17 - 29:21)
a problem for me (29:19 - 29:25)
specifically is that unite is just very (29:21 - 29:27)
time consuming (29:25 - 29:30)
and if and i was i was saying this to my (29:27 - 29:32)
twitch chat because they were like oh (29:30 - 29:34)
you can try to get to master rank before (29:32 - 29:36)
and you have like five days (29:34 - 29:37)
and (29:36 - 29:38)
like (29:37 - 29:40)
this this is my problem with unite and (29:38 - 29:42)
again this is a me problem i have things (29:40 - 29:45)
that i am like trying to do on stream or (29:42 - 29:47)
like try to get done before a certain (29:45 - 29:49)
time and then usually like because i try (29:47 - 29:51)
to plan out my content and i try to plan (29:49 - 29:52)
out what i want to do and like for (29:51 - 29:57)
example like i'm pretty good now in july (29:52 - 29:58)
so that i've gotten everything i need to (29:57 - 30:00)
get done before go fest that i wanted to (29:58 - 30:02)
do on stream (30:00 - 30:04)
um and like i really thought like i i (30:02 - 30:05)
ended up getting chinese dynasty i (30:04 - 30:06)
thought that that was going to take more (30:05 - 30:09)
time it didn't and now like i'm just (30:06 - 30:10)
kind of like okay well go fest is in a (30:09 - 30:12)
couple days (30:10 - 30:15)
so i don't i i have time now for unite (30:12 - 30:17)
but then i like log in and it's like oh (30:15 - 30:19)
the season resets in five days (30:17 - 30:22)
like i don't want to try to like grind (30:19 - 30:23)
when everything's going to get reset (30:22 - 30:25)
anyways i'll just wait the five days and (30:23 - 30:26)
then start but then at that point i'm (30:25 - 30:27)
going to be at gophers i'm going to be (30:26 - 30:29)
busy so the cycle starts over where now (30:27 - 30:31)
i'm busy for like two or three weeks and (30:29 - 30:33)
then it's like well if i just waited a (30:31 - 30:36)
week the season resets there's like this (30:33 - 30:38)
so like i'm confused (30:36 - 30:41)
you can't play unite just to have fun (30:38 - 30:43)
the the it's because like (30:41 - 30:46)
i don't like doing this is this is not a (30:43 - 30:48)
unite issue this is like for destiny or (30:46 - 30:51)
for apex legends i i don't like (30:48 - 30:54)
that (30:51 - 30:54)
there are reward tracks (30:55 - 30:59)
and i want to like complete the reward (30:57 - 31:00)
track (30:59 - 31:02)
like oh i don't want to do i don't even (31:00 - 31:04)
want to do the 12 person challenge (31:02 - 31:06)
even though it's cool because i don't (31:04 - 31:09)
think i can do 12 characters in five (31:06 - 31:10)
days i don't know i think it ends in (31:09 - 31:12)
like four days or three days when this (31:10 - 31:17)
podcast goes i did all 12 in two hours (31:12 - 31:17)
but i don't have i don't even have 12 (31:17 - 31:21)
characters unlocked (31:18 - 31:21)
i have i mean i have enough money to get (31:22 - 31:27)
the what i guarantee i guarantee you (31:24 - 31:28)
have (31:27 - 31:30)
at least six temporary licenses oh (31:28 - 31:34)
you're right i probably do like (31:30 - 31:36)
you can it's easy to do it and if you (31:34 - 31:38)
just say to people which is what i did (31:36 - 31:40)
we all said hey let's try to knock these (31:38 - 31:41)
out tonight (31:40 - 31:43)
let's just do quick battles go through (31:41 - 31:46)
them quick uh and if you have somebody (31:43 - 31:48)
who's done that before who's playing a (31:46 - 31:49)
character that's really that they're (31:48 - 31:52)
good with you can sail through them (31:49 - 31:54)
yeah again this is like a me issue i'm (31:52 - 31:55)
sure some people log in they don't care (31:54 - 31:56)
about the battle pass they don't care (31:55 - 31:58)
about walking the cramer rant that was (31:56 - 31:59)
like the last one i think i completed (31:58 - 32:01)
which was like log in i think you had to (31:59 - 32:04)
log in like 10 days in like a three week (32:01 - 32:06)
period to like walk the cram rant and (32:04 - 32:07)
then like (32:06 - 32:09)
do one battle a day there was like some (32:07 - 32:11)
music note one and i was logging in i (32:09 - 32:12)
think it was to get like the sylveon (32:11 - 32:13)
skin (32:12 - 32:15)
and i was like i'm not actually sure (32:13 - 32:17)
what i'm doing to like get the music (32:15 - 32:19)
notes to like play the piano and i was (32:17 - 32:20)
like i never finished that one (32:19 - 32:22)
oh i finished that one (32:20 - 32:24)
here's what i think (32:22 - 32:26)
again that's not a problem with unite i (32:24 - 32:29)
think really good (32:26 - 32:32)
at like keeping people who log in every (32:29 - 32:33)
day (32:32 - 32:35)
something to do and i think that's (32:33 - 32:36)
fantastic (32:35 - 32:38)
i think there is a slight disconnect for (32:36 - 32:40)
people who don't log in every day and (32:38 - 32:42)
maybe somebody who logs in once a week (32:40 - 32:43)
of like (32:42 - 32:45)
i don't know what's going on like and (32:43 - 32:47)
the things you want me to do require me (32:45 - 32:51)
to log in way more than once a week (32:47 - 32:53)
to get this stuff done (32:51 - 32:55)
and again it's not bad it's just like i (32:53 - 32:58)
disagree with that (32:55 - 33:00)
you can log in once a week and complete (32:58 - 33:02)
a lot of these things because most of (33:00 - 33:04)
them run for three weeks (33:02 - 33:08)
and most of the login rewards are at max (33:04 - 33:11)
log in five times so you may have to log (33:08 - 33:14)
in twice in one week but in that time (33:11 - 33:16)
you'll be able to do the login bonuses (33:14 - 33:18)
not a problem (33:16 - 33:20)
and i will say that one thing that they (33:18 - 33:21)
do do is (33:20 - 33:24)
if you haven't logged in for a while (33:21 - 33:25)
they do everything in their power to (33:24 - 33:27)
catch you up (33:25 - 33:29)
yes they do because like when i logged (33:27 - 33:31)
in it said you haven't logged in in 43 (33:29 - 33:33)
days and i was like that sounds right (33:31 - 33:37)
because 43 days amateur i was 197 (33:33 - 33:39)
days but that that's a hundred percent (33:37 - 33:41)
the thing i was talking about earlier of (33:39 - 33:43)
like when i'm ready to play unite the (33:41 - 33:45)
season is about to end (33:43 - 33:47)
and i think most seasons are like 60 (33:45 - 33:49)
days i if i remember correctly (33:47 - 33:52)
roughly yeah so it's like oh yep this is (33:49 - 33:54)
correct it means the season's about to (33:52 - 33:56)
end i came in at the start of the season (33:54 - 33:58)
i debated whether i wanted to commit i (33:56 - 34:00)
didn't have time to commit now i'm like (33:58 - 34:01)
ready to give it time but the season's (34:00 - 34:03)
about but like (34:01 - 34:08)
it offered me like 4 000 coins to do one (34:03 - 34:11)
match yeah and this is the second or (34:08 - 34:12)
third time where it's like i think i (34:11 - 34:14)
think they are they do this offer if (34:12 - 34:16)
it's been more than a month (34:14 - 34:17)
um (34:16 - 34:20)
and every the all three times they've (34:17 - 34:22)
given me a bot match (34:20 - 34:24)
so i don't know if that's intentional (34:22 - 34:25)
um (34:24 - 34:28)
but like i don't know 4 000. (34:25 - 34:30)
because at the level that you're at it's (34:28 - 34:32)
tough to get a match (34:30 - 34:35)
that's one of the issues of (34:32 - 34:38)
late in the season when you're not in (34:35 - 34:40)
veteran ultra or masters (34:38 - 34:42)
it is tough to find people to get a (34:40 - 34:45)
match to do so you end up doing bot (34:42 - 34:48)
matches more at the lower levels because (34:45 - 34:50)
there just aren't people (34:48 - 34:52)
playing in those levels (34:50 - 34:55)
so it becomes difficult to (34:52 - 34:57)
like there's times at lower levels where (34:55 - 34:58)
it's like (34:57 - 35:00)
you've been waiting a minute we're still (34:58 - 35:02)
trying and we're changing our parameters (35:00 - 35:04)
to try to get more to try to find you a (35:02 - 35:07)
match and generally it will default to a (35:04 - 35:08)
bot match at that point because it's (35:07 - 35:11)
incredibly hard to find people yeah but (35:08 - 35:14)
they offered me 4 000 coins which is (35:11 - 35:17)
like half a unite license yeah (35:14 - 35:19)
it's it's like it's an incredible reward (35:17 - 35:21)
and i a million percent agree with you (35:19 - 35:22)
greg i feel like (35:21 - 35:24)
it sounded like i was complaining but i (35:22 - 35:26)
feel like if you are playing unite every (35:24 - 35:27)
day (35:26 - 35:29)
or you're logging in or you're playing (35:27 - 35:31)
it a lot i feel like they are rewarding (35:29 - 35:34)
you with tons of stuff (35:31 - 35:36)
and i i do feel like if if you're (35:34 - 35:38)
logging in once a week it's it can be (35:36 - 35:41)
like overwhelming or like there's maybe (35:38 - 35:42)
sometimes not enough pull because it's (35:41 - 35:44)
like oh well come back like three more (35:42 - 35:46)
times to like finish this and it's like (35:44 - 35:47)
yeah (35:46 - 35:49)
you're asking a lot but okay um (35:47 - 35:51)
and then that like off centered by like (35:49 - 35:55)
their skins are so incredibly expensive (35:51 - 35:57)
but i also i think that's just like (35:55 - 36:00)
where a lot of games fall like again i i (35:57 - 36:02)
compare it a lot to apex legends because (36:00 - 36:04)
i play it like you get so much for free (36:02 - 36:07)
in apex legends just by playing and then (36:04 - 36:09)
all of a sudden it's like they want 20 (36:07 - 36:10)
for a gun skin for a gun that you might (36:09 - 36:12)
not even pick up in a 20-minute match (36:10 - 36:14)
it's like (36:12 - 36:15)
somebody's out there buying that 20 (36:14 - 36:18)
gaskin it's not me it's definitely not (36:15 - 36:21)
me like there there's one character in (36:18 - 36:23)
apex legends that i will i will spend (36:21 - 36:25)
money on and that's crypto and just (36:23 - 36:27)
because i i love crypto if if there's a (36:25 - 36:29)
20 skin for crypto it usually comes (36:27 - 36:31)
maybe once every six months and like (36:29 - 36:34)
apex is free and i have a good time so (36:31 - 36:36)
here's your 20 for my crypto skin i'll (36:34 - 36:37)
see you in another six months for (36:36 - 36:38)
another 20 (36:37 - 36:41)
and i do feel that way with unite like i (36:38 - 36:44)
was really excited for the cowboy cram (36:41 - 36:46)
what was that like it was like a 40 skin (36:44 - 36:47)
or whatever yeah (36:46 - 36:48)
and i did it (36:47 - 36:50)
and they don't there's no more skins for (36:48 - 36:52)
kramer like i (36:50 - 36:54)
i would probably give them money for (36:52 - 36:56)
more skins and then but i look at other (36:54 - 36:58)
characters like wow that snorlax skin is (36:56 - 36:59)
really cool (36:58 - 37:01)
i don't play snorlax i have no desire to (36:59 - 37:03)
play snorlax maybe i'll play snorlax in (37:01 - 37:05)
a quick play because like i need to but (37:03 - 37:06)
like (37:05 - 37:08)
i i just don't like that playstyle same (37:06 - 37:10)
for cinderella's like it's cool i think (37:08 - 37:12)
cinderella is a cool pokemon i think (37:10 - 37:14)
cinderella is great in the anime i think (37:12 - 37:15)
i like watching other people play (37:14 - 37:17)
cinderella's i don't want to ever play (37:15 - 37:18)
cinderella i just don't like that (37:17 - 37:21)
playstyle um but it's cool that he gets (37:18 - 37:23)
a bunch of skins same for greninja (37:21 - 37:25)
um so even though the skins are super (37:23 - 37:26)
expensive (37:25 - 37:28)
maybe because i'm so picky in my play (37:26 - 37:33)
style like that alone saves me money (37:28 - 37:35)
i think you might like del fox del fox (37:33 - 37:36)
and cramer play similar (37:35 - 37:39)
do they yeah i see i think we're in the (37:36 - 37:41)
water and wins fire (37:39 - 37:44)
i think greninja and cinderella's play (37:41 - 37:46)
similar they have like kind of like the (37:44 - 37:48)
long range narrow (37:46 - 37:51)
shooting things yeah (37:48 - 37:53)
but i like like because i had to play (37:51 - 37:54)
cramer ant (37:53 - 37:57)
i had i had to play cram rant in my 12 (37:54 - 37:59)
challenge how did i play cramer before (37:57 - 38:00)
no (37:59 - 38:03)
why would i oh i don't know oh it's the (38:00 - 38:06)
worst pokemon um (38:03 - 38:09)
and i was surprised like (38:06 - 38:11)
the abilities like the abilities between (38:09 - 38:13)
them do slightly different things but (38:11 - 38:16)
like placing so placing cramarat's pool (38:13 - 38:19)
is pretty much the same as placing (38:16 - 38:21)
fire spin the only difference is that (38:19 - 38:23)
del fox's fire spin will follow (38:21 - 38:26)
them whereas the pool is stationary but (38:23 - 38:28)
the pool does more damage than the fire (38:26 - 38:30)
spin does anyways (38:28 - 38:31)
there's a there's a couple ways that i (38:30 - 38:34)
felt like oh this is a this is similar (38:31 - 38:34)
to (38:34 - 38:37)
how del fox plays (38:34 - 38:38)
yeah (38:37 - 38:39)
and i think that's one of the things (38:38 - 38:41)
about unite is if you try other (38:39 - 38:42)
characters you just like oh this is (38:41 - 38:44)
similar as to this other character that (38:42 - 38:47)
is playing it just had it's just (38:44 - 38:49)
got a different focus (38:47 - 38:50)
yeah (38:49 - 38:53)
like trevident is amazing in that game (38:50 - 38:55)
i am also at the point of unite again (38:53 - 38:56)
this is not a complaint it's just like (38:55 - 38:58)
it's you problem this is a me problem (38:56 - 39:00)
this is but this is maybe a problem for (38:58 - 39:02)
people who are like me they haven't (39:00 - 39:04)
logged in in 43 days (39:02 - 39:06)
we were playing that match (39:04 - 39:08)
i came down to dreadnaught (39:06 - 39:11)
to help out and then trevina i don't (39:08 - 39:12)
know what he did he started pushing and (39:11 - 39:14)
there was a weird glow around him i was (39:12 - 39:16)
like i don't know what he's doing i i (39:14 - 39:18)
don't i don't know what this is because (39:16 - 39:20)
i've only played against one trevenant (39:18 - 39:23)
and then like aegis slash all i hear is (39:20 - 39:24)
though there's some weird sound issues (39:23 - 39:27)
in this game oh yeah h is very loud (39:24 - 39:30)
and eager slash made this huge slashing (39:27 - 39:31)
thing and i was like i don't know i (39:30 - 39:32)
don't know what to do i don't know i (39:31 - 39:33)
don't know where to walk i don't know (39:32 - 39:35)
where to go i like i don't know how (39:33 - 39:36)
people play league of legends there's (39:35 - 39:38)
like seven million characters in that (39:36 - 39:40)
game how do you remember what everyone (39:38 - 39:41)
is doing there's like 40 characters in (39:40 - 39:43)
the united i have no clue what focus on (39:41 - 39:46)
your lane (39:43 - 39:46)
in all things pokemon unite (39:47 - 39:53)
just get out of the way (39:50 - 39:55)
i mean that is it (39:53 - 39:57)
like espeon came in and there was this (39:55 - 39:58)
huge like (39:57 - 40:00)
psychic cloud yeah i was like i'm not i (39:58 - 40:02)
don't know i'm standing in it i don't (40:00 - 40:03)
know what it's doing get out (40:02 - 40:05)
get out so i mean trevenant has so (40:03 - 40:08)
trevor has horn leech which is the push (40:05 - 40:10)
it pushes you and steals (40:08 - 40:13)
health from you which is how treven it (40:10 - 40:16)
survives but the black cloud is curse so (40:13 - 40:18)
what's interesting about trevenant is (40:16 - 40:21)
treven is sacrificing health with curse (40:18 - 40:24)
to slow and kill anybody who's in the (40:21 - 40:26)
cloud and then you horn leech to get (40:24 - 40:28)
your health back so the interesting (40:26 - 40:30)
thing about trevenant's play style is (40:28 - 40:32)
you're constantly playing with your own (40:30 - 40:33)
health (40:32 - 40:34)
to (40:33 - 40:36)
to negatively impact other people so if (40:34 - 40:39)
you can get out of the horn leech (40:36 - 40:41)
traveling treven's in a bad spot because (40:39 - 40:44)
it sacrificed health with the curse to (40:41 - 40:46)
try to line you up for a horn lead so if (40:44 - 40:47)
you can get out like if you can eject (40:46 - 40:49)
away and it doesn't hit you (40:47 - 40:52)
then then it's easier to kill trevenant (40:49 - 40:54)
and those are things you just get from (40:52 - 40:57)
playing right but playing more (40:54 - 41:00)
in all things unite if you see a path if (40:57 - 41:03)
you see a circle get out get away just (41:00 - 41:04)
move away (41:03 - 41:06)
because almost everything is direction (41:04 - 41:09)
based they're coming towards you (41:06 - 41:11)
and you do not want to be in front of it (41:09 - 41:13)
but there are some pokemon you want to (41:11 - 41:14)
close the gap on like cramer ant you (41:13 - 41:16)
want to get close to cram you want to (41:14 - 41:18)
get close to decidueye you want to get (41:16 - 41:19)
close to del fox you want to get close (41:18 - 41:21)
to the attackers (41:19 - 41:23)
because they don't have a lot of health (41:21 - 41:25)
like you want to get away from defenders (41:23 - 41:27)
because they are stealing your health (41:25 - 41:28)
you want to get close to attackers (41:27 - 41:30)
because they're frail (41:28 - 41:32)
what about speedsters (41:30 - 41:34)
speedsters speedsters and all arounders (41:32 - 41:36)
it depends on how they that's the thing (41:34 - 41:39)
you just don't know how they built them (41:36 - 41:41)
so you just are like uh i don't know if (41:39 - 41:43)
i need to get away or if i need to get (41:41 - 41:45)
close like (41:43 - 41:47)
you need to both be close and away from (41:45 - 41:50)
ages (41:47 - 41:50)
i hope the boss rush brings people back (41:52 - 41:59)
i mean it looks like bosh rush is not (41:56 - 42:00)
pvp (41:59 - 42:03)
it's your squad against a boss which i'm (42:00 - 42:05)
very excited for and it has thrilling (42:03 - 42:08)
rewards yes (42:05 - 42:08)
and they're adding and they're adding (42:08 - 42:12)
collectible tokens are you excited for (42:10 - 42:13)
tokens (42:12 - 42:15)
no i i this is the hollow spray issue in (42:13 - 42:19)
apex legends this is just a fill (42:15 - 42:19)
and this is just a waste spots in the (42:20 - 42:24)
loot box (42:22 - 42:24)
do you know how much stuff i have (42:25 - 42:29)
triples of from the loot box (42:26 - 42:31)
yeah boxes are useless (42:29 - 42:35)
right i don't i don't think this is like (42:31 - 42:37)
i was (42:35 - 42:39)
so for not logging in 43 days (42:37 - 42:41)
i i went to like the hoodie section and (42:39 - 42:43)
the pants section and the the sh (42:41 - 42:44)
there's nothing (42:43 - 42:47)
like they'll do like full outfits like (42:44 - 42:49)
here's your gardevoir outfit here's your (42:47 - 42:51)
zarina outfit here's your aegislash (42:49 - 42:52)
outfit (42:51 - 42:55)
but i am actually surprised how slow (42:52 - 42:58)
they are to release (42:55 - 43:00)
just do the hoodie and do it pink and (42:58 - 43:02)
then do the hoodie and do it green and (43:00 - 43:04)
do the hoodie and do a purple and then (43:02 - 43:05)
just (43:04 - 43:07)
dump those into the loot box some of the (43:05 - 43:11)
full outfits are individual (43:07 - 43:12)
pieces that you can mix and match but (43:11 - 43:14)
you have to buy the whole outfit that's (43:12 - 43:18)
sort of like the catch with outfits (43:14 - 43:18)
like the decidueye (43:18 - 43:22)
whole outfit (43:20 - 43:23)
are two separate parts it's the hoodie (43:22 - 43:26)
with green hair and shoes and you can (43:23 - 43:28)
equip them separately but you have to (43:26 - 43:31)
buy them as a set (43:28 - 43:31)
i'm still mad that like the cramer ant (43:31 - 43:37)
forces me to have like blonde hair (43:33 - 43:39)
like it's it's like their clothing and (43:37 - 43:41)
unite is so good and pokemon go could (43:39 - 43:43)
learn a lesson from that (43:41 - 43:45)
yeah because they have socks (43:43 - 43:46)
yeah they do they have lots of socks but (43:45 - 43:48)
then they do weird choices like you (43:46 - 43:50)
can't wear this hat without forcing your (43:48 - 43:52)
hair to be like correct hot pink it's (43:50 - 43:54)
like yeah but (43:52 - 43:55)
let me just wear the hat as the hat like (43:54 - 43:58)
why are we submitting an rfe man (43:55 - 43:59)
i'm sure they've got a place you can (43:58 - 44:02)
submit an rfe (43:59 - 44:02)
uh anyways um very excited for united's (44:03 - 44:08)
first anniversary it looks like it's a (44:06 - 44:10)
lot uh it's a lot i'm excited for it (44:08 - 44:12)
we'll see if it brings people back or (44:10 - 44:15)
gets people excited and um (44:12 - 44:16)

much as i do but i love it (44:16 - 44:20)
some people like it some people don't (44:20 - 44:25)

was in germany (46:48 - 46:51)
what i had did when (46:50 - 46:55)

they they they paid for dinner i got (46:55 - 46:59)
chicken nuggets we talked about this hey (46:57 - 47:00)
but (46:59 - 47:02)

and i did they they talked a lot about (47:07 - 47:12)
vr glasses um (47:09 - 47:15)
and i i sat across from the one of the (47:12 - 47:16)
people one of the main people on (47:15 - 47:19)
campfire and they said campfire is going (47:16 - 47:24)
to be out the day after go fest berlin (47:19 - 47:24)
and i was like cool and they were like (47:24 - 47:28)
you can feel free to show it off on your (47:26 - 47:29)
stream because this was this was (47:28 - 47:31)
saturday night (47:29 - 47:33)
and niantic told us (47:31 - 47:37)
these uh the people who went to berlin (47:33 - 47:41)
don't show off campfire (47:37 - 47:41)
because they gave it to us early i don't (47:41 - 47:46)
even know what campfire is oh okay (47:42 - 47:48)
can we start there (47:46 - 47:51)
sir what is campfire (47:48 - 47:53)
okay we'll do okay so this is off (47:51 - 47:56)
pokemon go live.com this is introducing (47:53 - 47:58)
campfire this is a dev diver remember (47:56 - 48:01)
nine trainers niantic was gonna do dev (47:58 - 48:03)
diaries every two months (48:01 - 48:05)
i ignore them guess (48:03 - 48:08)
sure uh for june's dev diary we (48:05 - 48:11)
interviewed a member of our staff who's (48:08 - 48:13)
worked on the newest social feature that (48:11 - 48:16)
will make coordinating activities in (48:13 - 48:19)
pokemon go easier (48:16 - 48:21)
read mikey's thoughts on how we design (48:19 - 48:23)
these new features how they will enhance (48:21 - 48:26)
in-person gameplay and how campfire will (48:23 - 48:29)
be implemented in pokemon go now and in (48:26 - 48:31)
the future (48:29 - 48:33)
uh so (48:31 - 48:33)
the (48:33 - 48:37)
mikey is a pokemon go product manager (48:33 - 48:38)
they say uh (48:37 - 48:40)
they started playing pokemon go back in (48:38 - 48:42)
the summer of 2016. (48:40 - 48:44)
they've been playing pokemon games for (48:42 - 48:46)
20 years (48:44 - 48:49)
uh and they they are excited to show off (48:46 - 48:52)
campfire i skipped that first paragraph (48:49 - 48:53)
i summed it up for you (48:52 - 48:55)
so (48:53 - 48:57)
they that says campfire will help you (48:55 - 48:59)
meet your local community when we were (48:57 - 49:01)
thinking of making pokemon go better we (48:59 - 49:03)
reflected on what makes pokemon go's (49:01 - 49:05)
experience special (49:03 - 49:07)
themes came up again and again that (49:05 - 49:09)
pokemon go helps trainers befriend (49:07 - 49:11)
people who share common interests and (49:09 - 49:13)
explore the world around them we want to (49:11 - 49:14)
design something that makes those (49:13 - 49:16)
experiences more meaningful and with (49:14 - 49:18)
these new social features we hope we (49:16 - 49:19)
have done that (49:18 - 49:21)
or if you're on vacation somewhere and (49:19 - 49:23)
you want to explore new areas near you (49:21 - 49:25)
using campfire is a fun and unique way (49:23 - 49:27)
to shape your own adventure and meet (49:25 - 49:29)
friends once you met up with trainers (49:27 - 49:31)
you can send them friend requests you (49:29 - 49:32)
can even direct message them to (49:31 - 49:34)
coordinate your next meetup (49:32 - 49:36)
community exploration real world (49:34 - 49:38)
interactions shape the pokemon go (49:36 - 49:40)
experience we hope these new features (49:38 - 49:42)
will make connections even stronger and (49:40 - 49:45)
easier to maintain (49:42 - 49:47)
um (49:45 - 49:50)
and so campfire is a separate app (49:47 - 49:52)
they say here for for us the most (49:50 - 49:53)
important thing when designing these (49:52 - 49:55)
features is how we can enhance the (49:53 - 49:57)
collaborative aspect of trainers in (49:55 - 49:59)
pokemon go's experience with this in (49:57 - 50:01)
mind we made accessing campfire features (49:59 - 50:04)
within pokemon go quick and easy but for (50:01 - 50:06)
more of an involved experience trainers (50:04 - 50:08)
can also use the campfire app itself we (50:06 - 50:10)
know that trainers love taking parts and (50:08 - 50:11)
raids we designed campfire to (50:10 - 50:14)
specifically make the aspects to pokemon (50:11 - 50:16)
go easier to coordinate inside campfire (50:14 - 50:19)
app trainers can share raid locations uh (50:16 - 50:21)
with friends direct messages or in group (50:19 - 50:23)
chats make it easier to team up quickly (50:21 - 50:26)
and efficiently for those who typically (50:23 - 50:27)
play on your own don't worry when you (50:26 - 50:30)
tap a gem on the map you will be see the (50:27 - 50:32)
option to add a flare that will (50:30 - 50:33)
encourage other trainers nearby to come (50:32 - 50:35)
and join you (50:33 - 50:37)
and it says we're still working hard to (50:35 - 50:38)
integrate campfire we hope to roll out (50:37 - 50:41)
more features soon pokemon go special (50:38 - 50:44)
unique blah blah (50:41 - 50:44)
so (50:45 - 50:49)
so niantic gave me campfire (50:45 - 50:52)
and whatever by sure a bunch of other (50:49 - 50:54)
creators like two weeks before campfire (50:52 - 50:56)
was supposed to come out then they told (50:54 - 50:56)
me (50:56 - 50:59)
campfire was supposed to come out (50:56 - 51:00)
thursday (50:59 - 51:03)
the day before go fest berlin which is (51:00 - 51:05)
friday saturday sunday and there was a (51:03 - 51:07)
whole campfire (51:05 - 51:10)
booth that there still was at berlin (51:07 - 51:12)
that was one of the things on the map (51:10 - 51:13)
you could walk there (51:12 - 51:15)
you could learn about campfire they had (51:13 - 51:17)
like three or four employees like (51:15 - 51:18)
niantic employees (51:17 - 51:20)
to show you campfire (51:18 - 51:22)
and then like this is what niantic told (51:20 - 51:25)
me they said they decided to push the (51:22 - 51:28)
release of campfire back until after go (51:25 - 51:30)
fest because they were worried (51:28 - 51:32)
that people in berlin would get confused (51:30 - 51:34)
about campfire (51:32 - 51:35)
and (51:34 - 51:39)
that would like ruin their go experience (51:35 - 51:41)
and honestly that made sense like you're (51:39 - 51:43)
right you're launching a new feature (51:41 - 51:44)
people are traveling to berlin for the (51:43 - 51:46)
first time like they're going to be like (51:44 - 51:48)
what is this flare thing when they're at (51:46 - 51:50)
go fest (51:48 - 51:53)
yeah wait wait three days totally cool (51:50 - 51:55)
understood but you could still go to (51:53 - 51:57)
like the booth and like learn about it (51:55 - 52:00)
and then on saturday and they told us (51:57 - 52:01)
not to show it off because they were (52:00 - 52:03)
like don't don't show it off until we (52:01 - 52:05)
say so because we don't want to confuse (52:03 - 52:06)
people (52:05 - 52:08)
okay totally okay like genuine like we (52:06 - 52:10)
don't want to which it also makes sense (52:08 - 52:11)
to me (52:10 - 52:14)
um i know when we talk about niantic (52:11 - 52:16)
giving this information it's like ah (52:14 - 52:19)
but it made sense of like you don't want (52:16 - 52:20)
to launch a product (52:19 - 52:22)
have people be confused and frustrated (52:20 - 52:24)
and then be like i'm never touching that (52:22 - 52:26)
up again you don't want the will (52:24 - 52:27)
experience correct (52:26 - 52:29)
correct (52:27 - 52:31)
um so it was like just wait three days (52:29 - 52:33)
and then we'll launch it so i'm i'm (52:31 - 52:35)
having dinner with niantic on saturday (52:33 - 52:37)
night and (52:35 - 52:39)
the the guy from campfire i'm not (52:37 - 52:42)
allowed to name any names uh the the (52:39 - 52:45)
person from campfire said hey i give you (52:42 - 52:47)
approval to show up campfire on your (52:45 - 52:48)
stream because they knew i was twitch (52:47 - 52:49)
streaming all weekend they were like (52:48 - 52:51)
we're gonna launch it anyways we're not (52:49 - 52:53)
worried about confusion anymore cause (52:51 - 52:54)
you know (52:53 - 52:57)
whatever feel free to show it off so i i (52:54 - 52:59)
showed it off on stream on sunday and (52:57 - 53:02)
what what happens so it's a separate app (52:59 - 53:04)
you download it you log in with your (53:02 - 53:06)
niantic id and it pulls (53:04 - 53:09)
all of your friends from pokemon go into (53:06 - 53:12)
the app uh it also would do that for (53:09 - 53:14)
ingress it works for ingress as well but (53:12 - 53:16)
not pivot in bloom (53:14 - 53:18)
not picking those people out of here not (53:16 - 53:20)
pikmin bloom i'm sure maybe it worked (53:18 - 53:22)
for harry potter would have worked for (53:20 - 53:25)
harry potter but right away (53:22 - 53:28)
you now go from having zero like i have (53:25 - 53:30)
300 people on my friends list (53:28 - 53:32)
don't know who half of them are (53:30 - 53:33)
but (53:32 - 53:35)
as soon as i download the campfire app i (53:33 - 53:37)
now have an ability to direct message (53:35 - 53:39)
those people on my friends list because (53:37 - 53:41)
campfire pulls that entire thing so this (53:39 - 53:44)
is great in a couple instances (53:41 - 53:45)
you have that one person on your friends (53:44 - 53:48)
list where you're one heart away neither (53:45 - 53:50)
of you refuse to send a gift because you (53:48 - 53:52)
want to coordinate that lucky egg now (53:50 - 53:54)
you have a way to message that person (53:52 - 53:56)
and coordinate that lucky egg great (53:54 - 53:59)
perfect awesome it's a feature that (53:56 - 54:00)
for (53:59 - 54:01)
six years people have been asking for (54:00 - 54:04)
you've made this social game (54:01 - 54:06)
and you have no way to communicate with (54:04 - 54:08)
the people on your friends list (54:06 - 54:11)
now you do um (54:08 - 54:13)
so you can download okay let's back up a (54:11 - 54:16)
second you can download campfire (54:13 - 54:17)
you can (54:16 - 54:19)
and that's it but that's about it if you (54:17 - 54:21)
bought a go fest seattle ticket you will (54:19 - 54:26)
be able to get into the campfire app (54:21 - 54:27)
it's july 16th (54:26 - 54:30)
go fest berlin was july (54:27 - 54:32)
ended july 3rd (54:30 - 54:33)
i was told it was supposed to come out (54:32 - 54:35)
the 4th or the 5th (54:33 - 54:37)
it's not out i (54:35 - 54:39)
it's not here (54:37 - 54:41)
i don't i don't know where it is like (54:39 - 54:43)
they told me that it was supposed to (54:41 - 54:45)
come out the week of the fourth and it (54:43 - 54:48)
was ready and it was ready before gofest (54:45 - 54:50)
berlin it's been like if the app works (54:48 - 54:52)
i've been using it i don't know where it (54:50 - 54:53)
is (54:52 - 54:55)
like i literally (54:53 - 54:57)
sat across from three people who worked (54:55 - 54:58)
on campfire and was like yep it's (54:57 - 55:01)
supposed to be out this week (54:58 - 55:04)
it's suspicious it's not here yet so i'm (55:01 - 55:07)
confused about that (55:04 - 55:10)
uh but i think it's a cool app and they (55:07 - 55:11)
told me at (55:10 - 55:13)
dinner they wanted to make a really (55:11 - 55:15)
lightweight app they didn't want it to (55:13 - 55:16)
do too much (55:15 - 55:19)
and they said they they specifically (55:16 - 55:21)
said we know this app is not perfect and (55:19 - 55:23)
we know that this app has a lot of (55:21 - 55:25)
potential instead of us (55:23 - 55:28)
thinking of what trainers want to do for (55:25 - 55:30)
six months and delaying the app (55:28 - 55:32)
we just want to put it out there and (55:30 - 55:35)
actually see what trainers do with it (55:32 - 55:37)
which (55:35 - 55:40)
i 100 agree with that there are some (55:37 - 55:42)
times where you make something (55:40 - 55:44)
and then you think that your audience is (55:42 - 55:46)
going to interact with it one way and (55:44 - 55:48)
then they do uh they interact with it a (55:46 - 55:50)
totally different way that you didn't (55:48 - 55:53)
plan and then you have to pivot on that (55:50 - 55:54)
so they're like we don't even want the (55:53 - 55:55)
pivot part (55:54 - 55:57)
here's the basic features (55:55 - 55:59)
tell us what else you want (55:57 - 56:01)
we'll we'll we'll go with that instead (55:59 - 56:04)
of sitting on this for six more months (56:01 - 56:06)
and thinking what we think you're going (56:04 - 56:07)
to do with it (56:06 - 56:11)
so i'm in the app store right now (56:07 - 56:13)
yes (56:11 - 56:16)
a niantic campfire is in the app store (56:13 - 56:17)
right now yes yes (56:16 - 56:18)
you can't log in (56:17 - 56:22)
and it has a 2.4 rating (56:18 - 56:24)
because you can't log in because you (56:22 - 56:26)
can't correct because this is what they (56:24 - 56:30)
were trying to prevent yeah (56:26 - 56:30)
why is it in here if you can't you like (56:30 - 56:34)
pull it pull it (56:33 - 56:36)
well it was supposed to um it was (56:34 - 56:38)
supposed to launch the two weeks ago (56:36 - 56:40)
greg (56:38 - 56:43)
i mean it's in there it's got a 2.4 (56:40 - 56:45)
rating it's not doing it any good (56:43 - 56:46)
yeah (56:45 - 56:48)
because they they literally delayed the (56:46 - 56:49)
app because they didn't want to cause (56:48 - 56:51)
confusion well but guess what people are (56:49 - 56:55)
confused yes i know (56:51 - 56:55)
so here's the thing i know there are (56:56 - 57:00)
some people that (56:58 - 57:02)
i see it all the time they they they (57:00 - 57:05)
don't want to play pokemon go as a (57:02 - 57:07)
social game they want to play it solo i (57:05 - 57:10)
i totally get it i think campfire is (57:07 - 57:12)
still great solo (57:10 - 57:14)
because i was telling this in (57:12 - 57:16)
in slack (57:14 - 57:18)
um (57:16 - 57:20)
you can you cannot use any of the social (57:18 - 57:22)
features there's there's like a direct (57:20 - 57:24)
message feature right i could direct (57:22 - 57:25)
message greg in campfire i don't know (57:24 - 57:27)
why i would i would just text greg just (57:25 - 57:31)
text me i could i could make like a a (57:27 - 57:33)
group chat like a slack or like a (57:31 - 57:35)
discord where we could have like 40 (57:33 - 57:39)
people talk about our favorite pasta (57:35 - 57:40)
um (57:39 - 57:41)
and maybe maybe you're listening to this (57:40 - 57:42)
and you're like i don't care about any (57:41 - 57:43)
of that i don't want to direct message (57:42 - 57:44)
anyone i don't want to be any more (57:43 - 57:46)
discords i don't want to be in any more (57:44 - 57:47)
group chats (57:46 - 57:48)
even if you don't care about any of that (57:47 - 57:50)
stuff the great thing that campfire does (57:48 - 57:52)
is it shows you all the raids in the (57:50 - 57:55)
area and what's happening in those raids (57:52 - 57:57)
so if i if i open my app right now and i (57:55 - 57:58)
see (57:57 - 58:00)
i can only if i open pokemon go right (57:58 - 58:02)
now and i spin my character around i can (58:00 - 58:05)
only see so many gyms and raids right (58:02 - 58:08)
i can only see what my character can see (58:05 - 58:11)
so at my house i can see three four five (58:08 - 58:13)
i can see about seven gyms (58:11 - 58:15)
and i can only see what's happening in (58:13 - 58:19)
those seven gyms in campfire i can move (58:15 - 58:21)
the map around like google maps or apple (58:19 - 58:23)
maps and i can go (58:21 - 58:25)
what's at mall of america right now (58:23 - 58:27)
and i can see all the raids at mall (58:25 - 58:28)
america and i can see okay there's a (58:27 - 58:31)
zapdos there's a rock roof there's a (58:28 - 58:33)
pikachu with a cake on its head (58:31 - 58:36)
and i can see that like oh there's a (58:33 - 58:38)
five star raid (58:36 - 58:41)
in like 40 minutes i can get some (58:38 - 58:42)
american 15 (58:41 - 58:46)
so i i i can prep that when i get to (58:42 - 58:47)
mall of america (58:46 - 58:49)
i can then light a flare i can walk up (58:47 - 58:51)
to that five-star rate that's about to (58:49 - 58:53)
hatch i can light a flare and other (58:51 - 58:57)
people looking at campfire can see (58:53 - 58:59)
that i'm at that raid waiting for it to (58:57 - 59:00)
pop (58:59 - 59:03)
and the flare will also (59:00 - 59:05)
provide the option to the people in my (59:03 - 59:06)
community because you can make (59:05 - 59:10)
communities and say like oh steve's (59:06 - 59:11)
i don't have to like text greg that i'm (59:10 - 59:13)
there if greg's in the community active (59:11 - 59:15)
and i light a flare greg's gonna get the (59:13 - 59:16)
push that like oh steve's at mall (59:15 - 59:18)
america about to do this raid in 15 (59:16 - 59:20)
minutes maybe i'll head over or i'm in (59:18 - 59:22)
the area i'll i'll make the 20-minute (59:20 - 59:25)
drive for the 15-minute raid (59:22 - 59:27)
so there there's a bunch of social (59:25 - 59:28)
features that are like really really (59:27 - 59:29)
cool and it's what people have been (59:28 - 59:31)
asking for (59:29 - 59:33)
right like how do i let people know i'm (59:31 - 59:34)
at a raid (59:33 - 59:36)
how do i message the people that i want (59:34 - 59:38)
to open a lucky egg i think it's i think (59:36 - 59:39)
it's really great and it was it was (59:38 - 59:42)
really exciting to like talk to the team (59:39 - 59:44)
and how they're excited about it (59:42 - 59:48)
and i i don't think it's going to (59:44 - 59:50)
like there are there are discords that (59:48 - 59:53)
exist where you just remote raid all day (59:50 - 59:55)
right (59:53 - 59:57)
um like our discord or our slack where (59:55 - 59:59)
people will post a raid and then uh (59:57 - 60:01)
everyone's remoting in like that's the (59:59 - 60:04)
thing the campfire's not designed to (60:01 - 60:06)
get rid of that experience it's a local (60:04 - 60:08)
experience (60:06 - 60:10)
but (60:08 - 60:10)
i think it can also be local in the (60:10 - 60:16)
sense of (60:13 - 60:16)
even if you have an online community i (60:17 - 60:20)
guess this is more specific for me (60:18 - 60:22)
and we know that a bunch of people in (60:20 - 60:25)
our community are going to go fast (60:22 - 60:27)
seattle (60:25 - 60:28)
i think that that campfire would be a (60:27 - 60:32)
great way to be like okay we're all here (60:28 - 60:34)
i want to raid with steve and (60:32 - 60:36)
the other people that are a part of (60:34 - 60:38)
steve's community campfire would be (60:36 - 60:41)
great for that like weekend experience (60:38 - 60:42)
um (60:41 - 60:45)
but yeah it's it is definitely designed (60:42 - 60:47)
for like you know if i'm if i'm popping (60:45 - 60:49)
if i'm if i'm lighting a flare near a (60:47 - 60:52)
zapdos i'm all america it's not gonna (60:49 - 60:54)
benefit anyone who's in my community in (60:52 - 60:56)
like florida right they're not going to (60:54 - 60:59)
be like i'll be there like six hours (60:56 - 61:01)
hold on catch a flight real quick hold (60:59 - 61:03)
up it would be nice to be like oh to (61:01 - 61:05)
invite anybody who's online on your (61:03 - 61:07)
friends list yeah so you don't have to (61:05 - 61:08)
go through and pick and choose and (61:07 - 61:10)
everything but yeah you can't have (61:08 - 61:11)
everything (61:10 - 61:12)
yeah and like (61:11 - 61:14)
their goal was we just want it to be (61:12 - 61:16)
lightweight and simple (61:14 - 61:17)
we want to see what trainers do with it (61:16 - 61:19)
and then we'll want to add the features (61:17 - 61:22)
that are requested so (61:19 - 61:24)
um (61:22 - 61:25)
i don't know what those features are i (61:24 - 61:27)
don't i i don't know what i would (61:25 - 61:29)
specifically want like right now i'm (61:27 - 61:31)
happy with campfire because all i really (61:29 - 61:33)
want the this is the thing (61:31 - 61:35)
that i do as a player when i get to a (61:33 - 61:38)
new area like when i like i go to st (61:35 - 61:39)
louis right (61:38 - 61:41)
get to my hotel never been to this part (61:39 - 61:43)
of st louis (61:41 - 61:44)
i don't know what's around me i don't (61:43 - 61:46)
know should i should i go north should i (61:44 - 61:48)
go south should i walk to the left (61:46 - 61:50)
should i walk to the right it would be (61:48 - 61:51)
nice to open up an app and be like oh (61:50 - 61:54)
there's a ton of gyms over here i'm just (61:51 - 61:55)
going to walk in that direction because (61:54 - 61:56)
like (61:55 - 61:58)
over here there's nothing (61:56 - 62:01)
over here the ocean (61:58 - 62:01)
so (62:01 - 62:04)
so i like that aspect of it i like (62:01 - 62:06)
the you know i like the exploring aspect (62:04 - 62:08)
of pokemon go i like being able to pick (62:06 - 62:10)
a direction walk in it and like see that (62:08 - 62:13)
part of the city the town the whatever (62:10 - 62:14)
um (62:13 - 62:15)
that being said i don't know where (62:14 - 62:17)
campfire is uh i've been in the app (62:15 - 62:19)
store nobody can use it it's got a 2.4 (62:17 - 62:21)
rating you can use it if you bought a (62:19 - 62:25)
ticket to seattle go faster (62:21 - 62:25)
speaking of seattle go fast (62:26 - 62:31)
who i heard there's going to be this (62:29 - 62:33)
steve fella there that nobody's heard of (62:31 - 62:35)
yeah he's going to be at the influencer (62:33 - 62:37)
booth (62:35 - 62:39)
yes what does he influence (62:37 - 62:40)
their their (62:39 - 62:42)
[Laughter] (62:40 - 62:44)
so (62:42 - 62:47)
uh we we ran an ad earlier for pokemon (62:44 - 62:49)
go fest (62:47 - 62:52)
um a full disclosure that niantic did (62:49 - 62:54)
pay me to run that ad (62:52 - 62:55)
they (62:54 - 62:58)
they want people to buy tickets to go (62:55 - 63:01)
fest right if you are in the seattle (62:58 - 63:03)
area are you close to seattle niantic is (63:01 - 63:06)
this is their final push of like hey (63:03 - 63:08)
you should be at go fest (63:06 - 63:10)
um uh my gofundme to get me to seattle (63:08 - 63:13)
failed so i'm not going (63:10 - 63:16)
ah i don't play mute ticket like i don't (63:13 - 63:17)
understand why domestic flights are more (63:16 - 63:19)
expensive than international flights at (63:17 - 63:20)
this point (63:19 - 63:23)
hey but if you're in the seattle area (63:20 - 63:25)

is you don't need a ticket (65:24 - 65:28)
you don't have to get a go fest ticket (65:26 - 65:30)
for this so for example (65:28 - 65:32)
if you bought a gofest ticket for (65:30 - 65:35)
saturday but you're there all weekend (65:32 - 65:37)
you can come to the raid tour on friday (65:35 - 65:40)
and saturday if you want and sunday (65:37 - 65:41)
because (65:40 - 65:44)
niantic cannot restrict spawns in (65:41 - 65:46)
downtown seattle (65:44 - 65:49)
and there's always a catch no and we're (65:46 - 65:51)
doing raids so you can just (65:49 - 65:54)
be a part of our train that getting (65:51 - 65:55)
money off of you doing raids because (65:54 - 65:57)
you're right they are getting coming out (65:55 - 65:58)
of you because of raids that is the (65:57 - 66:00)
catch but you people buy those great (65:58 - 66:03)
prizes and i think it's really i think (66:00 - 66:05)
it's one of the (66:03 - 66:08)
minus niantic making money off you (66:05 - 66:09)
because of raids you would probably be (66:08 - 66:11)
doing raids anyways but like trying to (66:09 - 66:13)
organize like i and i think that's a (66:11 - 66:17)
thing about go fest where i would (66:13 - 66:19)
that argue is a weakness because will (66:17 - 66:21)
and i technically did this back in (66:19 - 66:24)
chicago we played go fest on friday and (66:21 - 66:25)
then on saturday we just explored (66:24 - 66:28)
downtown chicago with friends and we did (66:25 - 66:30)
rights and it was great (66:28 - 66:34)
so niantic kind of like hey you guys are (66:30 - 66:36)
community leaders you probably have (66:34 - 66:38)
people that are are there early and they (66:36 - 66:39)
don't know what they're going to do the (66:38 - 66:42)
day before i think like having us (66:39 - 66:44)
get people together and explore the city (66:42 - 66:47)
together and do raids is is really great (66:44 - 66:49)
so i'm supposed to be doing that monday (66:47 - 66:51)
sorry i keep saying monday friday (66:49 - 66:53)
saturday sunday (66:51 - 66:54)
10 30 (66:53 - 66:57)
to 12 30 the ray tour in the city part (66:54 - 67:00)
of chicago i just don't know the exact (66:57 - 67:01)
meetup location (67:00 - 67:04)
um and then the meet agreed is at four (67:01 - 67:06)
um (67:04 - 67:07)
the (67:06 - 67:10)
if you don't have a ticket though (67:07 - 67:14)
and you walk into the seattle center (67:10 - 67:16)
which is okay so let's say you don't (67:14 - 67:18)
have a ticket you're on the fence (67:16 - 67:20)
you pick which day you want to play you (67:18 - 67:21)
can only play one day friday saturday (67:20 - 67:23)
sunday and then you pick whether you (67:21 - 67:25)
want the city experience in the morning (67:23 - 67:27)
or you want the park experience in the (67:25 - 67:31)
morning and then there's a an hour break (67:27 - 67:33)
and then people flip so if you do the (67:31 - 67:35)
city in the morning you do park in the (67:33 - 67:37)
afternoon if you do park in the morning (67:35 - 67:39)
you do the city in the afternoon city is (67:37 - 67:41)
literally (67:39 - 67:44)
all of seattle like it is like i if if (67:41 - 67:46)
you if you (67:44 - 67:48)
follow pokemon go people on twitter (67:46 - 67:50)
you've probably seen this map (67:48 - 67:52)
their city experience is like all the (67:50 - 67:54)
way down like past seattle's airport (67:52 - 67:56)
which is in i think at that point is in (67:54 - 68:00)
tacoma um like you you have so much (67:56 - 68:02)
range (68:00 - 68:04)
to play in the city (68:02 - 68:05)
you don't have to play like one block (68:04 - 68:08)
away from seattle center (68:05 - 68:11)
but when you're in the seattle center (68:08 - 68:13)
that's not very big (68:11 - 68:15)
the space needle is there the museum is (68:13 - 68:17)
there the monorail is there (68:15 - 68:20)
so the center of seattle not a building (68:17 - 68:22)
called the seattle center seattle center (68:20 - 68:23)
is a park (68:22 - 68:27)
okay seattle's the seattle center (68:23 - 68:29)
park is like the space needle and the (68:27 - 68:32)
park around the space needle okay (68:29 - 68:34)
um so (68:32 - 68:35)
you're there for four hours and then (68:34 - 68:37)
you're in the city for four hours if you (68:35 - 68:39)
have (68:37 - 68:42)
seattle center will have zero spawns (68:39 - 68:43)
there is no point (68:42 - 68:46)
in going into the seattle center when (68:43 - 68:48)
it's not your play time (68:46 - 68:51)
when when it is your four hour play time (68:48 - 68:53)
you will have spawns you will have stops (68:51 - 68:55)
but there but niantic is turning that (68:53 - 68:58)
off and they did this for chicago (68:55 - 69:00)
that the one that will so when they did (68:58 - 69:01)
the lincoln park (69:00 - 69:04)
zoo that was the second go fest (69:01 - 69:06)
there there was no fence so anyone could (69:04 - 69:10)
walk in to the because it's a zoo (69:06 - 69:10)
they can't like restrict the zoo (69:11 - 69:15)
but they they didn't see any pokemon and (69:13 - 69:17)
there was no stops so you could walk (69:15 - 69:19)
through the seattle you could go to the (69:17 - 69:21)
space needle (69:19 - 69:23)
anyone could go to the space needle (69:21 - 69:25)
but you won't be able to see pokemon or (69:23 - 69:27)
stops unless it's your four hour play (69:25 - 69:28)
time (69:27 - 69:29)
there (69:28 - 69:31)
um (69:29 - 69:33)
i don't know how that works for (69:31 - 69:36)
everything else in the seattle (69:33 - 69:37)
center (69:36 - 69:38)
yeah now that you said that greg that's (69:37 - 69:41)
very confusing seattle center is (69:38 - 69:42)
the (69:41 - 69:44)
is the park not to be confused with the (69:42 - 69:48)
center of seattle (69:44 - 69:48)
uh (69:51 - 69:53)
but yeah go fest is happening this (69:52 - 69:57)
weekend i'm excited uh (69:53 - 70:00)
it will probably be a very busy weekend (69:57 - 70:03)
which means we get to take over again (70:00 - 70:05)
yeah are you really we're going to rule (70:03 - 70:06)
the roots (70:05 - 70:07)
another surprise i don't know we'll see (70:06 - 70:09)

weird or like you hide from people do (70:36 - 70:42)
not do not do not play this game i'm a (70:39 - 70:45)
very i'm a social butterfly greg (70:42 - 70:47)
ha when (70:45 - 70:49)
when i get invited to stuff and i'm like (70:47 - 70:51)
can i bring greg and then i bring greg (70:49 - 70:52)
and then you do 90 of the talking and (70:51 - 70:55)
i'm like this is 90 yeah 90 of the (70:52 - 70:57)
talking while you sit on your phone (70:55 - 71:01)
i was i'm not on my phone (70:57 - 71:03)
i just i just shake my head and i'm like (71:01 - 71:06)
yes hello greg do the talking (71:03 - 71:08)
i i don't know where campfire is though (71:06 - 71:11)
but it's in the app store with the 2.4 (71:08 - 71:13)
hey if you buy a ticket to seattle go (71:11 - 71:17)
fest you'll be able to actually log in (71:13 - 71:17)
um i think that's all the news we have (71:18 - 71:23)
uh (71:21 - 71:25)
i guess it's time for question of the (71:23 - 71:29)
week i want the question of the week (71:25 - 71:34)
let's have the question of the week (71:29 - 71:34)
uh (71:41 - 71:44)
let's see (71:42 - 71:44)
oh wait i had the question of the week (71:48 - 71:52)
and then there we go (71:49 - 71:52)
is this (71:53 - 71:56)
this is not the newest question of the (71:55 - 71:58)
week isn't it july 15th i don't know (71:56 - 72:00)
what's going on july 17th is the most (71:58 - 72:02)
recent one in the (72:00 - 72:05)
it's been two years uh well this is this (72:02 - 72:08)
is a more technical question but yeah (72:05 - 72:09)
but should be answered it's been two (72:08 - 72:12)
years since ise hosted a guest interview (72:09 - 72:15)
do we have plans later this year (72:12 - 72:15)
who was the guest interview two years (72:15 - 72:18)
ago (72:17 - 72:22)
um who was the last interview (72:18 - 72:24)
i would you don't invite us to them so (72:22 - 72:25)
it's whatever you do (72:24 - 72:28)
i don't usually invite you guys to them (72:25 - 72:30)
because they're like at the weirdest (72:28 - 72:31)
times in the entire world and they're (72:30 - 72:33)
almost always last minute which is (72:31 - 72:34)
actually the reason why there's not (72:33 - 72:37)
guest interviews is because i will plan (72:34 - 72:40)
them and then they just get cancelled (72:37 - 72:43)
and this is why i'm a good guest because (72:40 - 72:45)
we plan a date i check in a week before (72:43 - 72:47)
i check in the day before i verify (72:45 - 72:50)
everything's on track (72:47 - 72:52)
like i've guessed it on three podcasts (72:50 - 72:55)
since i'm the opposite of june (72:52 - 72:57)
people invite me on their podcast and (72:55 - 72:58)
like i'm like oh yeah that sounds like a (72:57 - 73:00)
good idea and then five weeks later i'm (72:58 - 73:02)
like oh that's right that person asked (73:00 - 73:03)
me to be on their podcast and i (73:02 - 73:04)
completely forgot (73:03 - 73:07)
oops (73:04 - 73:09)
i'm the perfect guest (73:07 - 73:10)
it is (73:09 - 73:12)
it is for (73:10 - 73:13)
for (73:12 - 73:14)
[Music] (73:13 - 73:17)
for me it's always been a nightmare to (73:14 - 73:21)
get we had aaron zhang on one time (73:17 - 73:23)
i remember that (73:21 - 73:26)
great great dude that was a very fun (73:23 - 73:27)
episode (73:26 - 73:28)
it took (73:27 - 73:29)
two (73:28 - 73:33)
years to get him on (73:29 - 73:34)
like (73:33 - 73:36)
when i say two years i messaged him two (73:34 - 73:38)
years prior to that episode was like hey (73:36 - 73:39)
do you want to be on ise and he was like (73:38 - 73:41)
yeah man sure and i was like cool pick a (73:39 - 73:42)
time (73:41 - 73:44)
and then he picked the time and then he (73:42 - 73:46)
canceled (73:44 - 73:47)
and then we (73:46 - 73:50)
he was like i'm really busy my circle (73:47 - 73:51)
back in like three months cool circled (73:50 - 73:53)
back okay didn't hear anything okay i (73:51 - 73:55)
waited another like three months circled (73:53 - 73:56)
back he was like yeah man sorry just (73:55 - 73:58)
been busy all right pick a time he takes (73:56 - 74:01)
the time he cancels like (73:58 - 74:03)
people get busy (74:01 - 74:05)
totally understand (74:03 - 74:07)
the the whole (74:05 - 74:09)
interview thing (74:07 - 74:11)
is very (74:09 - 74:11)
it's is a very time consuming and this (74:11 - 74:16)
is the problem with millennials (74:14 - 74:17)
you can't (74:16 - 74:20)
make a plan and stick to it (74:17 - 74:22)
you tell me when we're going to do the (74:20 - 74:24)
thing i am there (74:22 - 74:26)
i think that's a millennial thing i (74:24 - 74:29)
think that's just a people thing (74:26 - 74:30)
i i (74:29 - 74:32)
i've had tons of people ask me to be on (74:30 - 74:35)
shows and you know if i'm busy like i (74:32 - 74:36)
had somebody ask (74:35 - 74:39)
like a week before arceus came out like (74:36 - 74:41)
you want to be on my podcast (74:39 - 74:44)
would love to but now i can no not now (74:41 - 74:47)
i got to prep for this game launch like (74:44 - 74:49)
i would love to be on hey i want you to (74:47 - 74:52)
message me in like 45 days like give me (74:49 - 74:55)
a full month plus like a week after the (74:52 - 74:56)
game came out to like kind of like catch (74:55 - 74:57)
up (74:56 - 74:59)
but i put that back on you like if you (74:57 - 75:01)
want me to be on i'm you you have to (74:59 - 75:03)
follow back up with me in like 45 days (75:01 - 75:08)
like i i get it too but um (75:03 - 75:08)
it is really hard let's alter this (75:10 - 75:15)
question (75:14 - 75:16)
sure (75:15 - 75:20)
who would you want to be your next guest (75:16 - 75:23)
um well speaking of cybertron we've had (75:20 - 75:26)
cybertron on we've had (75:23 - 75:28)
we've had ray rizzo on so you want wolfy (75:26 - 75:31)
glick on so that you can do your battle (75:28 - 75:33)
no not battle i i think (75:31 - 75:36)
i i think i think wolfe makes great (75:33 - 75:38)
content i think his youtube channel is (75:36 - 75:40)
really great he is one of the best (75:38 - 75:43)
players if not the best player (75:40 - 75:46)
um so (75:43 - 75:48)
having him on would be would be great (75:46 - 75:50)
although like some sometimes the problem (75:48 - 75:53)
with guess interviews is (75:50 - 75:55)
and this is i like i listen to a ton of (75:53 - 75:58)
podcasts myself like i i consume a lot (75:55 - 76:00)
of podcasts a week sometimes when the (75:58 - 76:03)
interviewer is specialized in a topic (76:00 - 76:05)
and i don't care about the topic it's (76:03 - 76:08)
very easy for me to skip that 45 minutes (76:05 - 76:10)
so you would think (76:08 - 76:12)
on a pokemon go podcast (76:10 - 76:14)
that my interview would have talked a (76:12 - 76:16)
lot about pokemon go but i don't think (76:14 - 76:18)
we talked about that game until the last (76:16 - 76:21)
20 minutes (76:18 - 76:23)
so i i would imagine if somebody doesn't (76:21 - 76:24)
care about competitive pokemon and then (76:23 - 76:26)
like wolfy glick is on they'd be like oh (76:24 - 76:29)
you know 45 minutes i skipped that (76:26 - 76:31)
but you know i don't know you don't just (76:29 - 76:33)
talk about it's not like only talk to me (76:31 - 76:36)
about competitive like you talk to the (76:33 - 76:37)
person (76:36 - 76:39)
yeah and their other interests you know (76:37 - 76:40)
sarah (76:39 - 76:43)
joe from serbia mr joe serbi um he said (76:40 - 76:45)
he wanted to be back on but and that was (76:43 - 76:46)
funny because like when we when he asked (76:45 - 76:49)
if he could be back on the episode (76:46 - 76:53)
we were at worlds in dc (76:49 - 76:53)
and then (76:53 - 76:58)
you know games came out and then cove it (76:56 - 77:00)
happened and then other games came out (76:58 - 77:04)
and then he's getting married and then (77:00 - 77:06)
if if we get joe back on it would have (77:04 - 77:08)
to be (77:06 - 77:10)
before scarlet violet because (77:08 - 77:11)
you know everyone's gonna be busy around (77:10 - 77:13)
that time so yeah i would like to get (77:11 - 77:14)
joe back on i would like to get wolfie (77:13 - 77:16)
glycon (77:14 - 77:17)
um (77:16 - 77:20)
well who would you like to interview (77:17 - 77:23)

why they make the decisions that that (78:25 - 78:29)
team makes because i'm like why are you (78:28 - 78:32)
doing this i don't understand (78:29 - 78:34)
when i was in the the twitch rivals and (78:32 - 78:38)
i was playing with indie bear and um (78:34 - 78:41)
like their really good team they would (78:38 - 78:44)
leave you know the a palms that yeah (78:41 - 78:47)
they would leave an apom alive yeah i've (78:44 - 78:49)
seen this and the reason they left an (78:47 - 78:51)
apom alive it took me like a couple (78:49 - 78:53)
games because we played a lot of games (78:51 - 78:54)
together to like try to win that (78:53 - 78:55)
tournament (78:54 - 78:56)
but the reason they would leave that a (78:55 - 79:00)
palm alive is because if they lost (78:56 - 79:02)
the (79:00 - 79:02)
xp battle (79:02 - 79:06)
in their lane (79:04 - 79:09)
the the (79:06 - 79:10)
um (79:09 - 79:11)
jungle (79:10 - 79:14)
could go back and get that apom (79:11 - 79:17)
and then get enough experience to still (79:14 - 79:20)
not be behind because i've seen people (79:17 - 79:23)
skip the last two a pumps to run to try (79:20 - 79:25)
to get to (79:23 - 79:28)
the autonomo before anybody else shows (79:25 - 79:28)
up (79:28 - 79:30)
yeah and i've seen that (79:28 - 79:32)
happen but like i want to know like the (79:30 - 79:34)
ins and outs of why like when do you do (79:32 - 79:35)
that what's your decision making like (79:34 - 79:37)
there's like an i'm good at unite but (79:35 - 79:40)
like there's definitely a next level (79:37 - 79:42)
you play it a lot you really know how to (79:40 - 79:43)
play this game that i'm interested you (79:42 - 79:45)
actually have strategies yeah i don't (79:43 - 79:48)
have strategies i just go in (79:45 - 79:51)
screaming and healing (79:48 - 79:53)
but i think to i think with those (79:51 - 79:54)
strategies though you pretty much always (79:53 - 79:57)
need to be five stacked (79:54 - 79:59)
like you're never going to be able to in (79:57 - 80:02)
a solo game or even a game oh yeah yeah (79:59 - 80:04)
like skip an apom and be like oh if this (80:02 - 80:06)
doesn't work out do it with three right (80:04 - 80:08)
like if you have three people which is (80:06 - 80:09)
like my ideal configuration for playing (80:08 - 80:12)
unite three like as long as you as long (80:09 - 80:14)
as like two of you are in the bottom (80:12 - 80:17)
lane and know this is what we're doing (80:14 - 80:20)
like you can do that yeah but it's (80:17 - 80:22)
easier if you're five yes absolutely (80:20 - 80:24)
yeah yeah (80:22 - 80:24)
uh this is our off uh our youtube if (80:26 - 80:30)
you're watching or listening on youtube (80:28 - 80:31)

says question of the week if you could (80:35 - 80:39)
have any company work with pokemon what (80:37 - 80:41)
would it be (80:39 - 80:43)
ford (80:41 - 80:43)
we're not going back to boxy trucks (80:44 - 80:48)
uh (80:47 - 80:50)
just any sort of (80:48 - 80:52)
any branding or just like video game do (80:50 - 80:54)
we are really (80:52 - 80:55)
or just any company (80:54 - 80:58)
there's a company (80:55 - 80:58)
give me a (81:00 - 81:03)
lion brand yarn (81:01 - 81:07)
series of pokemon themed yarns (81:03 - 81:10)
so that i can knit find pokemon (81:07 - 81:12)
amigurumi and then actually allow lion (81:10 - 81:14)
brand to come out with pokemon amigurumi (81:12 - 81:16)
patterns that are officially licensed (81:14 - 81:18)
so that all the people who start etsy (81:16 - 81:22)
shops with their pokemon umi patterns (81:18 - 81:25)
don't get shut down (81:22 - 81:26)
i would like (81:25 - 81:28)
uh so there's a company that makes (81:26 - 81:31)
cortex plus which is a really great rpg (81:28 - 81:34)
i would like an official pokemon branded (81:31 - 81:35)
rpg (81:34 - 81:37)
that's not made by me because i've made (81:35 - 81:39)
a lot of them but something like (81:37 - 81:41)
official (81:39 - 81:44)
and thought out by a lot of designers (81:41 - 81:47)
that's not me doing all the work (81:44 - 81:47)
i i i've always wished there was like a (81:50 - 81:54)
pokemon event in final fantasy 14 (81:52 - 81:57)
because i love that yoga (81:54 - 81:59)
like and the yokai watch event is it's (81:57 - 82:01)
it's just like a cute event it's just (81:59 - 82:03)
like a mount and a couple minions (82:01 - 82:06)
like it's not like it's it's a lot now (82:03 - 82:08)
it's but that's how it started yeah it's (82:06 - 82:12)
two mounts all the minions and (82:08 - 82:15)
all of the weapons based off of the (82:12 - 82:17)
minions for every class look at the (82:15 - 82:20)
whole thing now it's fun like once (82:17 - 82:21)
you've done it you never have to do it (82:20 - 82:22)
again because you get them all but (82:21 - 82:24)
yeah it's a is a huge (82:22 - 82:27)
thing but oh but also maybe to bring (82:24 - 82:29)
this closer to nintendo like it always (82:27 - 82:31)
kind of bothered me that like animal (82:29 - 82:32)
crossing didn't have pokemon stuff in it (82:31 - 82:35)
but it had like pikmin and zelda and (82:32 - 82:38)
metroid like that always bothered me too (82:35 - 82:38)
like (82:38 - 82:40)
just give me a pikachu statue like it (82:38 - 82:42)
doesn't have to be a lot but it's like (82:40 - 82:44)
literally well i know the mobile animal (82:42 - 82:45)
crossing had some (82:44 - 82:47)
pokemon stuff (82:45 - 82:49)
i think i had a dream the other night (82:47 - 82:51)
about a (82:49 - 82:54)
katamari damasi pokemon cross (82:51 - 82:56)
no that was just an episode you hosted a (82:54 - 82:58)
week ago (82:56 - 83:00)
oh wow that was a dream (82:58 - 83:03)
[Laughter] (83:00 - 83:04)
uh another we'll do one more question (83:03 - 83:07)
off youtube this is from fanny (83:04 - 83:09)
have you guys seen the leaks just a yes (83:07 - 83:12)
or a no no need to go into detail how do (83:09 - 83:14)
you think game freak could prevent leaks (83:12 - 83:16)
in the future thank you (83:14 - 83:20)
uh no and i stated very clearly on (83:16 - 83:22)
twitter and i'll say it on the program (83:20 - 83:25)
do not link me to links (83:22 - 83:26)
if i'm interested i will try to find (83:25 - 83:28)
them out on my own did you not look at (83:26 - 83:30)
the stuff for certain shields (83:28 - 83:31)
no (83:30 - 83:33)
not until we were a month away when it (83:31 - 83:35)
was really (83:33 - 83:37)
pretty final like we're still in the (83:35 - 83:40)
dark area of people making a lot of (83:37 - 83:42)
stuff up oh yeah (83:40 - 83:45)
and i'm not i'm not interested at (83:42 - 83:47)
all in in (83:45 - 83:49)
half the stuff people are posting (83:47 - 83:51)
because it just (83:49 - 83:53)
people get really revved up i've had (83:51 - 83:56)
more direct messages of people like (83:53 - 83:59)
fired up or angry because of something a (83:56 - 84:02)
leak said and my first response is you (83:59 - 84:05)
have no way of knowing if that's true (84:02 - 84:08)
i don't care how much you say you trust (84:05 - 84:10)
that person oh yeah it's like this (84:08 - 84:13)
leaker has like a 97 percent traffic (84:10 - 84:15)
record yeah because they throw a billion (84:13 - 84:17)
things against the wall and hope (84:15 - 84:19)
something stick and we have confirmation (84:17 - 84:22)
bias so when we go back we could say 95 (84:19 - 84:24)
of what they said was right yeah a month (84:22 - 84:26)
before the thing came out (84:24 - 84:28)
all the rest of it was garbage here's (84:26 - 84:29)
what i said on my twitch stream last (84:28 - 84:33)
night i was like look (84:29 - 84:36)
if if you take any animal of spain and (84:33 - 84:39)
you're like what animal does spain make (84:36 - 84:42)
me think of you think of in me i think (84:39 - 84:46)
of a bull and we and so (84:42 - 84:49)
if there was a leak (84:46 - 84:51)
or if there wasn't a leak that said like (84:49 - 84:53)
tauros has an evolution tauros has a (84:51 - 84:55)
regional form (84:53 - 84:58)
like i don't think that would shock (84:55 - 84:59)
anyone (84:58 - 85:01)
right and i and i feel like that is that (84:59 - 85:04)
is like the most common (85:01 - 85:05)
low level (85:04 - 85:07)
like a five-year-old could make this (85:05 - 85:10)
prediction of a pokemon game thing (85:07 - 85:11)
so (85:10 - 85:12)
when i (85:11 - 85:15)
so like if tauros gets a regional or an (85:12 - 85:18)
evolution or whatever you want i would (85:15 - 85:19)
be like (85:18 - 85:20)
dang (85:19 - 85:23)
yup not surprised yeah and if it didn't (85:20 - 85:25)
i would also be like (85:23 - 85:26)
not surprised (85:25 - 85:27)
like (85:26 - 85:30)
but like that but that's how i like look (85:27 - 85:32)
at some of the i did look at the leaks (85:30 - 85:34)
and i was like oh yeah sure whatever (85:32 - 85:36)
like 90 of the stuff probably won't (85:34 - 85:38)
happen but like when you look at it and (85:36 - 85:40)
it's like like (85:38 - 85:40)
i (85:40 - 85:41)
i (85:40 - 85:43)
i'm gonna say this i promise you it's (85:41 - 85:45)
okay one of the leaks was shiny pokemon (85:43 - 85:48)
are returning that was one of the leaks (85:45 - 85:50)
that is what i read is the words shiny (85:48 - 85:53)
pokemon are returning and then you go (85:50 - 85:56)
like oh this dude has a 95 track record (85:53 - 85:58)
yeah (85:56 - 86:01)
i got this like i have a leak for you (85:58 - 86:03)
there's new pokemon being introduced (86:01 - 86:05)
what (86:03 - 86:07)
like (86:05 - 86:07)
like i am not kidding you that was one (86:07 - 86:11)
of the leaks it said shiny pokemon are (86:09 - 86:14)
returning like (86:11 - 86:16)
like if the leak said there's an elite (86:14 - 86:19)
four i'd be like yeah probably sure yeah (86:16 - 86:21)
sure if the leak said there's not elite (86:19 - 86:23)
four i'd be like yep yeah there there's (86:21 - 86:25)
there was a game there was an elite four (86:23 - 86:27)
it was called sword and shield there was (86:25 - 86:30)
a champion cup it was pretty similar but (86:27 - 86:31)
like yeah (86:30 - 86:33)
like it's just (86:31 - 86:36)
greg is right we're at a point where (86:33 - 86:39)
like you could say anything and be like (86:36 - 86:41)
well this person has a great track (86:39 - 86:43)
record but the things they're saying (86:41 - 86:46)
are so like (86:43 - 86:46)
duh (86:46 - 86:49)
[Laughter] (86:46 - 86:51)
like you could say like oh mega (86:49 - 86:52)
evolution is returning and you'd be like (86:51 - 86:54)
yeah sure yeah that's sure yeah it makes (86:52 - 86:56)
sense you'd be like oh mega evolution is (86:54 - 86:58)
not returning you'd be like (86:56 - 86:59)
yeah that makes sense i mean it didn't (86:58 - 87:01)
return in this game like it it's (86:59 - 87:03)
literally 50 like just i i could i could (87:01 - 87:05)
go on twitter and just like write like (87:03 - 87:07)
seven things and be like (87:05 - 87:08)
i'm sure half of those are probably (87:07 - 87:10)
going to be true i don't know but (87:08 - 87:12)
it's wild like (87:10 - 87:14)
like yes there will probably be an (87:12 - 87:16)
evolution of a pokemon from gen 2 yeah (87:14 - 87:17)
sure i (87:16 - 87:18)
i don't know there'll probably be an (87:17 - 87:20)
evolution of (87:18 - 87:22)
the starters are gonna (87:20 - 87:24)
be cool the starters are gonna be lame (87:22 - 87:25)
like just pick pick one you're probably (87:24 - 87:28)
gonna be right yeah the other thing that (87:25 - 87:30)
that bothers me about current league (87:28 - 87:34)
culture is people get so worked up (87:30 - 87:36)
about (87:34 - 87:38)
nothing like there are people who are (87:36 - 87:38)
like (87:38 - 87:41)
angry about leaks and (87:38 - 87:44)
making a determination about a game (87:41 - 87:46)
that hasn't even come out yet about (87:44 - 87:48)
things you don't even know are true (87:46 - 87:52)
and they're like frothing about (87:48 - 87:54)
i like (87:52 - 87:56)
chill out you don't even know (87:54 - 87:58)
you're getting like you are taking on (87:56 - 88:00)
future stress for no good reason (87:58 - 88:05)
that's that's us in 2022. (88:00 - 88:05)
um if we do talk about the leaks sorry i (88:06 - 88:11)
spoiled that shiny pokemon are probably (88:09 - 88:13)
gonna be in the game damn it (88:11 - 88:16)
if we do talk about the leaks we will be (88:13 - 88:19)
we will be very clear about it (88:16 - 88:21)
we will we will lay it out (88:19 - 88:22)
you can bookmark this part of the (88:21 - 88:24)
episode be like steve predicted a tauros (88:22 - 88:26)
evolution yeah everything everyone under (88:24 - 88:28)
the sun did um i don't know if that's (88:26 - 88:30)
true by the way i'm just predicting a (88:28 - 88:32)
rosalia (88:30 - 88:36)
evolution because roses are big in spain (88:32 - 88:37)
perfect great (88:36 - 88:40)
i'm predicting uh (88:37 - 88:41)
kramer ant comes back because he was in (88:40 - 88:43)
the zeroed movie i don't know (88:41 - 88:46)
like (88:43 - 88:48)
give your reasons right (88:46 - 88:49)
um (88:48 - 88:52)
show your work nobody does (88:49 - 88:54)
i as somebody who reads wrestling (88:52 - 88:57)
spoilers or like what is supposed to (88:54 - 88:59)
happen in wrestling like i definitely (88:57 - 89:00)
understand the like (88:59 - 89:03)
the excitement that like leak culture (89:00 - 89:04)
can provide (89:03 - 89:07)
but uh but i also though like (89:04 - 89:09)
there are there are people that get very (89:07 - 89:12)
angry or very upset about things that (89:09 - 89:14)
probably don't happen and i think a (89:12 - 89:17)
really good example of that (89:14 - 89:20)
is when i started covering pokemon news (89:17 - 89:21)
and following it more closely that was (89:20 - 89:25)
the lead up to black and white and (89:21 - 89:27)
black and white too (89:25 - 89:28)
um (89:27 - 89:31)
but in but even prior to black and white (89:28 - 89:34)
there was always this like (89:31 - 89:36)
there was always i'm not rumors talk (89:34 - 89:38)
of like oh they're going to change the (89:36 - 89:40)
starters from fire water grass to (89:38 - 89:41)
something else (89:40 - 89:42)
it's been around for a long time yeah (89:41 - 89:44)
and for black and white (89:42 - 89:46)
from what i remember and it wasn't like (89:44 - 89:48)
you know twitter wasn't super super big (89:46 - 89:49)
around black and white it was getting (89:48 - 89:51)
big at that time it was like oh the (89:49 - 89:53)
starters are going to be dark (89:51 - 89:54)
fighting and psychic because that's it (89:53 - 89:56)
oh i remember that i remember that i (89:54 - 89:58)
remember that rumor and that never (89:56 - 89:59)
happened for black and white and then (89:58 - 90:00)
people were like oh black and white too (89:59 - 90:02)
it's going to happen and that never (90:00 - 90:03)
happened for black and white too and (90:02 - 90:04)
then people are like oh for x and y it's (90:03 - 90:07)
going to happen and it kinda happened in (90:04 - 90:10)
x and y because the final evolutions (90:07 - 90:13)
were that but not the starter (90:10 - 90:13)
like (90:13 - 90:16)
like greninja del fox and chestnut are (90:13 - 90:18)
fire psychic dark (90:16 - 90:19)
um (90:18 - 90:21)
so it did actually (90:19 - 90:24)
technically happen so like the those (90:21 - 90:26)
those leaks of like oh the starters are (90:24 - 90:27)
gonna be (90:26 - 90:29)
like i guess there was some truth to (90:27 - 90:31)
that but like not the (90:29 - 90:33)
not the same right like nah (90:31 - 90:34)
the starters weren't the final (90:33 - 90:36)
evolutions of the starters were that but (90:34 - 90:38)
they were still fire water grass so like (90:36 - 90:39)
again when i read some of these leaks (90:38 - 90:41)
and there was a lot of leaks for sword (90:39 - 90:42)
and shield that are just not true they (90:41 - 90:44)
were just not true no you got when i (90:42 - 90:47)
went to japan (90:44 - 90:49)
you guys did a whole episode and i love (90:47 - 90:51)
when i love when i'm not on the episodes (90:49 - 90:52)
because i i genuinely love listening to (90:51 - 90:54)
will and greg talk it's like my favorite (90:52 - 90:55)
thing ever and then i don't have to hear (90:54 - 90:57)
myself talk but like when you guys do (90:55 - 90:59)
episodes like i absolutely love it (90:57 - 91:01)
because i get to like listen as a fan to (90:59 - 91:02)
you guys talk but you guys did a whole (91:01 - 91:04)
episode when i was in japan about (91:02 - 91:06)
armored pokemon that were that were (91:04 - 91:09)
rumored to be in sword and shield (91:06 - 91:11)
