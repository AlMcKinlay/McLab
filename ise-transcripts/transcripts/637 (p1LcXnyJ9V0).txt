I have an excuse that&#39;s true very (0:52 - 0:59)
true uh sorry for the lighting or (0:56 - 1:01)
whatever is happening here this is the (0:59 - 1:03)
best I have at 9:00 in the morning on (1:01 - 1:06)
Sunday after this I&#39;m going to play day (1:03 - 1:12)
three of Safari Zone in Sean um but I (1:06 - 1:15)
think it&#39;s what 5:00 pm for you (1:12 - 1:19)
too yep on Saturday so as opposed to (1:15 - 1:20)
5:00 P p.m on Friday when you got (1:19 - 1:22)
confused with the days trying to (1:20 - 1:24)
schedule this yeah that was a little I (1:22 - 1:26)
woke up and I it was all solved by the (1:24 - 1:29)
time I like looked at my phone but I was (1:26 - 1:31)
like what is going on why do I have like (1:29 - 1:34)
15 messages from you guys me while I&#39;m (1:31 - 1:35)
like streaming and I&#39;m like why are (1:34 - 1:38)
there 20 messages what the it&#39;s just (1:35 - 1:41)
YouTube talking about (1:38 - 1:41)
something okay so uh I we&#39;ll do the (1:41 - 1:46)
we&#39;ll get the disclosures out of the way (1:45 - 1:51)
real quick um so uh Niantic paid for my (1:46 - 1:55)
flight to Jakarta and my hotel in (1:51 - 1:57)
Jakarta and they paid for my flight out (1:55 - 1:59)
of Jakarta I decided to take that flight (1:57 - 2:04)
out of Jakarta to South Korea um and (1:59 - 2:06)
that&#39;s where that disclosure ends uh (2:04 - 2:11)
flight hotel flight uh for South Korea (2:06 - 2:14)
uh Niantic paid for nothing although (2:11 - 2:16)
keep in mind I said they did pay for me (2:14 - 2:19)
to leave Jakarta I just chose to go to (2:16 - 2:21)
South Korea and not back (2:19 - 2:23)
home so you could say maybe they paid (2:21 - 2:25)
for me to get here so I am responsible (2:23 - 2:28)
for my own flight and hotel in South (2:25 - 2:30)
Korea I just want the disclosure to be (2:28 - 2:33)
there but but the Niantic did put me in (2:30 - 2:36)
touch with the city of in Chon&#39;s tourism (2:33 - 2:39)
department and their tour as tourism (2:36 - 2:44)
Department were giving some money to any (2:39 - 2:45)
it doesn&#39;t have to be like a Pokemon go (2:44 - 2:47)
YouTuber they are just looking for (2:45 - 2:50)
Content creators YouTube celebrities (2:47 - 2:55)
whatever to encourage tourism to inan (2:50 - 2:57)
because inan is the third biggest city (2:55 - 2:59)
in South Korea Soul being number one and (2:57 - 3:00)
they want more people people to come (2:59 - 3:03)
here because everyone lands in Inon (3:00 - 3:06)
airport and then directly go to (3:03 - 3:10)
Soul Soul&#39;s a cool city um so part of (3:06 - 3:14)
the tourism thing is ultimately the (3:10 - 3:15)
whatever the tourism department is (3:14 - 3:18)
paying just pays for my hotel ultimately (3:15 - 3:21)
is what they end up giving me so that&#39;s (3:18 - 3:24)
that&#39;s the disclosure uh and then I I (3:21 - 3:26)
pretty much have to pay my own flight (3:24 - 3:29)
home which isn&#39;t the cheapest but hey I (3:26 - 3:30)
don&#39;t know (3:29 - 3:32)
you got to go to both of these really (3:30 - 3:35)
cool events yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s true (3:32 - 3:38)
so there&#39;s my there&#39;s my disclosures uh (3:35 - 3:42)
before we get to talking about uh sa (3:38 - 3:44)
City Safari in Jakarta and Safari Zone (3:42 - 3:46)
in South Korea because they were very (3:44 - 3:48)
different events uh we got some Pokemon (3:46 - 3:50)
sleep (3:48 - 3:54)
news and the shock (3:50 - 3:58)
shocker and there will be finally a new (3:54 - 4:01)
area added to the game called the old (3:58 - 4:04)
gold power plant and that will debut on (4:01 - 4:06)
that is not very easy to say that will (4:04 - 4:07)
debut (4:06 - 4:12)
on October 2nd at 3 pm so you can use (4:07 - 4:15)
your easy travel ticket if you want to (4:12 - 4:16)
switch to (4:15 - 4:19)
it last time when lapis Lakeside came (4:16 - 4:21)
out there was the app said like (4:19 - 4:24)
different sleep Styles pokemon.com said (4:21 - 4:26)
different sleep Styles sarra be had (4:24 - 4:28)
something different I&#39;m just going to go (4:26 - 4:31)
off Pokemon sleep. net the official (4:28 - 4:33)
Pokemon sleep website they&#39;re saying (4:31 - 4:36)
this time you need 340 sleep styles to (4:33 - 4:41)
unlock old gold power plant makes sense (4:36 - 4:44)
and dozing will give you the grubbing (4:41 - 4:46)
line snoozing will give you the Shinx (4:44 - 4:48)
line and slumbering will give you the (4:46 - 4:51)
Aeron line and snorlax&#39;s favorite (4:48 - 4:53)
berries will be grea which is (4:51 - 4:56)
electric Blu is that how you say it (4:53 - 4:59)
bluck bluck yeah bluck which is Ghost (4:56 - 5:03)
and B bellu which is (4:59 - 5:06)
steel I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s how it&#39;s (5:03 - 5:08)
pronounced for some reason but sure how (5:06 - 5:11)
would how would you say (5:08 - 5:16)
it B kind of like blue but well it is (5:11 - 5:19)
spelled like the city Belle without the (5:16 - 5:23)
V right yeah so maybe you&#39;re right maybe (5:19 - 5:28)
Bell bellu B (5:23 - 5:28)
B sure (5:28 - 5:35)
uh are you well this is weird Hannah and (5:31 - 5:37)
I have been playing since day (5:35 - 5:40)
one um but I I&#39;ve been premium since day (5:37 - 5:42)
one Hannah has been (5:40 - 5:46)
freemium and then Bobby just started (5:42 - 5:49)
playing not even what like six months (5:46 - 5:51)
in it was March it was like two weeks (5:49 - 5:55)
before raicho so I think I have 420 (5:51 - 5:57)
something sleep Styles so I have more (5:55 - 6:01)
than enough for power plant what are you (5:57 - 6:03)
guys sit at I just I don&#39;t know how to (6:01 - 6:05)
check the exact number but I just hit (6:03 - 6:09)
the last goal so probably have enough (6:05 - 6:11)
yeah that&#39;s the last goal was three is (6:09 - 6:14)
340 right that would be my guess or no (6:11 - 6:17)
is it just every 50 because like it it&#39;s (6:14 - 6:18)
like (6:17 - 6:23)
240 was what it took for lapis and then (6:18 - 6:25)
290 is the next goal and I know this cuz (6:23 - 6:28)
I&#39;m at 278 so I&#39;m 12 from the next goal (6:25 - 6:31)
which is 290 and more would be the 340 I (6:28 - 6:33)
would need to get to to the power plant (6:31 - 6:36)
so (6:33 - 6:39)
you just hit oh wait that does not show (6:36 - 6:40)
you I don&#39;t know where you go to see (6:39 - 6:42)
your sleep Styles I think you click on (6:40 - 6:44)
your profile picture doing the math just (6:42 - 6:47)
a second yes you just click on your (6:44 - 6:49)
profile picture it&#39;ll show you I&#39;m at (6:47 - 6:54)
three four 433 out of (6:49 - 6:57)
572 gosh the next the next goal button (6:54 - 6:59)
will just show you how many you have (6:57 - 7:02)
until the next goal not once you have (6:59 - 7:03)
reached all of the goals which is (7:02 - 7:05)
apparently 290 so I am actually pretty (7:03 - 7:09)
far still because I have not been (7:05 - 7:12)
premium and I have been uh (7:09 - 7:15)
not totally keeping up every single (7:12 - 7:17)
night because when I was moving and (7:15 - 7:20)
things were chaotic I lost track and and (7:17 - 7:22)
you&#39;re moving like every two weeks so (7:20 - 7:24)
that&#39;s (7:22 - 7:27)
understandable but maybe less off track (7:24 - 7:31)
now that Apple watch and other Smart (7:27 - 7:35)
Watch devices can y track your sleep (7:31 - 7:37)
that&#39;s new as well right that&#39;s this is (7:35 - 7:40)
now my favorite way to play Pokemon (7:37 - 7:43)
sleep yeah yeah that was um Shadow (7:40 - 7:45)
dropped out of (7:43 - 7:47)
nowhere I mean they did they did (7:45 - 7:50)
announce the 2.0 update which we have no (7:47 - 7:51)
notes Here for but you would think that (7:50 - 7:55)
like Apple watch Fitbit Gala Samsung is (7:51 - 7:57)
it do they call it the Galaxy watch or (7:55 - 8:01)
the Samsung watch um that got added just (7:57 - 8:03)
on a random like (8:01 - 8:07)
Tuesday yeah it was great I saw the (8:03 - 8:09)
announcement and I immediately switched (8:07 - 8:11)
Pokemon sleep back over from my tablet (8:09 - 8:14)
to my phone so that I could use my watch (8:11 - 8:16)
just immedi has been sleeping with no (8:14 - 8:20)
with a 20-inch iPad under her (8:16 - 8:23)
pillow not the big one (8:20 - 8:25)
um (8:23 - 8:30)
but honestly truly using the smartwatch (8:25 - 8:33)
to play this game is far easier for me (8:30 - 8:36)
at least than having to remember to go (8:33 - 8:38)
into the app and press the button or (8:36 - 8:41)
having to remember to find wherever my (8:38 - 8:43)
Plus+ is whether I left it in a bag (8:41 - 8:45)
after going and playing Pokemon go and I (8:43 - 8:47)
don&#39;t want to get out of bed to go get (8:45 - 8:50)
it the Smartwatch is already on my wrist (8:47 - 8:53)
and I already used it for sleep tracking (8:50 - 8:57)
and with the new operating system at (8:53 - 8:59)
least of the Apple watch I think that it (8:57 - 9:00)
should (8:59 - 9:02)
automatically track sleep even without (9:00 - 9:05)
you having to do anything um wait can (9:02 - 9:07)
you know for sure if that&#39;ll (9:05 - 9:12)
work how you what what does the app look (9:07 - 9:14)
like what are you pressing are you (9:12 - 9:16)
pressing something to wake up go to (9:14 - 9:20)
sleep kind of so it is one of the focus (9:16 - 9:24)
modes in iOS in watchos you turn on the (9:20 - 9:27)
Sleep Focus mode and that tells your (9:24 - 9:28)
watch that you are going to go to sleep (9:27 - 9:32)
soon and then it will start sleep (9:28 - 9:35)
tracking that is at least what it says (9:32 - 9:37)
in the instructions for how to use (9:35 - 9:39)
Pokemon sleep now this may be different (9:37 - 9:43)
with the new watch OS update that was (9:39 - 9:44)
just (9:43 - 9:46)
released um and I&#39;m probably going to (9:44 - 9:47)
test that out tonight because they have (9:46 - 9:49)
a new feature where you can track sleep (9:47 - 9:52)
without even having to go into the Sleep (9:49 - 9:53)
Focus (9:52 - 9:56)
mode but yes basically just press a (9:53 - 9:59)
thing on the watch and it tracks sleep (9:56 - 10:01)
all night and you just turn it off again (9:59 - 10:03)
in the morning so you&#39;re not even (10:01 - 10:08)
hitting a Pokemon sleep button M nope (10:03 - 10:10)
not at all no it&#39;s just because so I&#39;ve (10:08 - 10:12)
been doing the same thing I never used a (10:10 - 10:14)
sleep Focus mode before because I do (10:12 - 10:15)
sleep with my watch but it&#39;s for the (10:14 - 10:18)
alarm typically because I like the (10:15 - 10:20)
having like it just vibrates your wrist (10:18 - 10:22)
you know to wake you up to half alarm (10:20 - 10:25)
yeah so I never used the Sleep Focus (10:22 - 10:28)
mode before so I set one of those up and (10:25 - 10:29)
I just set the Bedtime to be like the (10:28 - 10:32)
same time I had my bedtime set in (10:29 - 10:35)
Pokemon sleep and so at that time it (10:32 - 10:38)
just goes into the Sleep Focus mode I (10:35 - 10:39)
might not go to sleep at that time but (10:38 - 10:41)
the Sleep Focus mode like starts up at (10:39 - 10:44)
that time but then it does track when I (10:41 - 10:45)
actually do go to sleep so if I go to (10:44 - 10:48)
sleep 45 minutes later it didn&#39;t it (10:45 - 10:49)
doesn&#39;t start tracking the sleep at my (10:48 - 10:51)
sleep Focus Mode&#39;s time it actually (10:49 - 10:52)
starts tracking the sleep when I&#39;m (10:51 - 10:56)
actually have fallen asleep so and then (10:52 - 10:59)
that just integrates with apple health (10:56 - 11:01)
and then when I open up Pokemon sleep (10:59 - 11:04)
the next morning I do the you know (11:01 - 11:06)
synchronize button except now it&#39;ll say (11:04 - 11:08)
like do you want to synchronize with (11:06 - 11:09)
your go Plus+ or do you want to (11:08 - 11:11)
synchronize with apple health and I can (11:09 - 11:14)
choose and so I could do you can do both (11:11 - 11:16)
of them like I could technically have (11:14 - 11:18)
the go Plus+ set up as well and then in (11:16 - 11:20)
the morning you can just choose which (11:18 - 11:23)
one you want to have it synchronized (11:20 - 11:28)
with um the difference is I can see how (11:23 - 11:31)
much time I&#39;m going to get for sleep in (11:28 - 11:32)
Pokemon sleep before actually (11:31 - 11:33)
synchronizing it cuz you can look at it (11:32 - 11:35)
in apple health and you can see how much (11:33 - 11:38)
sleep it says you&#39;ve tracked for the (11:35 - 11:40)
night so you can you can see it (11:38 - 11:43)
beforehand versus like with the go Plus+ (11:40 - 11:45)
you you can&#39;t see it until you actually (11:43 - 11:47)
synchronize right like that that point (11:45 - 11:49)
is when You&#39; see how much sleep it it (11:47 - 11:53)
tracked for you so um this this morning (11:49 - 11:56)
it was a little weird cuz I got it told (11:53 - 11:59)
me I woke up before I did with my watch (11:56 - 12:00)
like the Apple Health said I woke up (11:59 - 12:04)
like an hour before I did I don&#39;t know I (12:00 - 12:06)
it might have been the fact that my kid (12:04 - 12:10)
came in like was jumping on the bed when (12:06 - 12:12)
I (12:10 - 12:14)
7:45 honestly I think any of the Sleep (12:12 - 12:16)
trackers that work with Pokemon sleep (12:14 - 12:18)
would have counted that as being awake (12:16 - 12:21)
yeah probably so that was uh you know it (12:18 - 12:23)
tracked a an hour less than I actually (12:21 - 12:26)
slept but H yeah I like it I like the I (12:23 - 12:27)
like using the watch though it&#39;s just (12:26 - 12:30)
not having to remember topress (12:27 - 12:32)
if you were to fully disconnect the go (12:30 - 12:35)
Plus+ so only have the option that says (12:32 - 12:38)
sync with Apple watch or apple Health (12:35 - 12:40)
then you would lose the Pikachu he would (12:38 - 12:41)
like go (12:40 - 12:43)
away oh I haven&#39;t even thought about (12:41 - 12:45)
that yes I think that yes that is (12:43 - 12:47)
correct because I haven&#39;t connected my (12:45 - 12:50)
Plus+ in a while so I lost Pikachu a (12:47 - 12:51)
while (12:50 - 12:57)
ago oh want the Pikachu for the old is (12:51 - 13:00)
helpful yes especially for the old Power (12:57 - 13:03)
Plant that&#39;s true so yeah mine&#39;s my go (13:00 - 13:05)
Plus+ is still (13:03 - 13:07)
connected H and now I feel like do I (13:05 - 13:10)
need to every once in a while like I (13:07 - 13:12)
think that as long as it stays connected (13:10 - 13:15)
it should be fine I believe my Pikachu (13:12 - 13:18)
left when I transferred from my phone to (13:15 - 13:23)
my tablet yeah yeah makes sense um so (13:18 - 13:26)
the 2.0 update does say there will be (13:23 - 13:30)
maintenance on October 1st (13:26 - 13:34)
from they&#39;re saying 13:30 to (13:30 - 13:37)
18 please note the time period is (13:34 - 13:38)
different than the previous (13:37 - 13:42)
ones uh so make sure to feed your (13:38 - 13:45)
Pikachu lunch before (13:42 - 13:49)
1:30 uh or whatever time that is wait I (13:45 - 13:51)
think that&#39;s UTC time so that would be (13:49 - 13:56)
it is is that 6:30 or 7:34 like central (13:51 - 14:00)
time it would be um well so it&#39;s I think (13:56 - 14:03)
it&#39;s 11:30 because for West Coast it&#39;s (14:00 - 14:08)
9:30 p.m. oh okay so it would be 11:30 (14:03 - 14:11)
p.m. uh centr okay okay okay yeah okay (14:08 - 14:15)
so it is different but okay that got it (14:11 - 14:17)
so I don&#39;t know okay with that anytime (14:15 - 14:19)
past 6 p.m. because it used to always be (14:17 - 14:22)
for like a while it was 600 p.m. and it (14:19 - 14:24)
was like so West Coast can&#39;t West Coast (14:22 - 14:25)
time it was 600 p.m. yeah and it was (14:24 - 14:27)
like West Coast can&#39;t feed dinner like (14:25 - 14:30)
if you go to bed at like 9 p.m. or like (14:27 - 14:32)
10 p.m. which is not you have to stay up (14:30 - 14:37)
super late to St L dinner you had no I (14:32 - 14:38)
did at least (14:37 - 14:42)
twice exactly so so now like the Alaska (14:38 - 14:45)
time zone (14:42 - 14:48)
is Miss um no actually Hawaii it&#39;s going (14:45 - 14:52)
to be 6:30 in Hawaii when it starts so (14:48 - 14:53)
they can we still got a half hour this (14:52 - 14:56)
was my whole argument was like just make (14:53 - 14:59)
it 15 minutes or 30 minutes later so (14:56 - 15:02)
that you can feed (14:59 - 15:02)
dinner um there will be we already said (15:03 - 15:11)
340 sleep styles to unlock additional (15:07 - 15:15)
two new sleep style Dex goals will be (15:11 - 15:19)
added um preparation for the gold power (15:15 - 15:22)
plant debut this is the 2.0 update A new (15:19 - 15:25)
ingredient is being added the rosing (15:22 - 15:26)
coffee or (15:25 - 15:30)
rousing coffee rousing coffee (15:26 - 15:33)
and then six new recipes probably using (15:30 - 15:34)
said (15:33 - 15:39)
coffee um you can also now use multiple (15:34 - 15:41)
ingredient tickets once this update (15:39 - 15:44)
happens instead of using one at a time (15:41 - 15:46)
uh they&#39;re going to fix the back button (15:44 - 15:48)
so it makes the back button take you (15:46 - 15:50)
directly to the home screen when you (15:48 - 15:53)
press and hold it down and then they&#39;re (15:50 - 15:54)
fixing some text they&#39;re fixing some (15:53 - 15:57)
other small bugs so for like a 2.0 (15:54 - 16:00)
update it doesn&#39;t (15:57 - 16:03)
seem that big you would think like 2.0 (16:00 - 16:05)
would be like a huge like oh my gosh (16:03 - 16:07)
second version of the (16:05 - 16:09)
game but like I felt like they could (16:07 - 16:11)
have just like saved the Apple watch (16:09 - 16:13)
stuff for the 2.0 and that would have (16:11 - 16:15)
been part of it and then I felt like (16:13 - 16:17)
that would have been like so big not not (16:15 - 16:19)
saying that this update is bad but it&#39;s (16:17 - 16:21)
just like you Shadow drop the which is a (16:19 - 16:23)
cool shadow drop to be like here&#39;s yeah (16:21 - 16:26)
watch support and then a week later like (16:23 - 16:29)
2.0 but we&#39;re not really adding anything (16:26 - 16:31)
they&#39;re adding a whole new island yeah (16:29 - 16:33)
but they did that before without it (16:31 - 16:35)
being like a 2.0 update when they added (16:33 - 16:37)
lapis right so I&#39;ll say I appreciate (16:35 - 16:40)
that this company that that select (16:37 - 16:42)
button is doing this in a way that they (16:40 - 16:44)
did Shadow drop the Apple watch thing or (16:42 - 16:46)
the Smartwatch thing and it wasn&#39;t like (16:44 - 16:48)
a big like this is 2.0 they were just (16:46 - 16:50)
like Tuesday you all of a sudden have a (16:48 - 16:52)
new way that you can track sleep because (16:50 - 16:54)
that&#39;s not a benefit for all of the (16:52 - 16:56)
users it&#39;s only a benefit for a subset (16:54 - 16:58)
of the users so I kind of like that it&#39;s (16:56 - 17:03)
not a key focus of the theoretically big (16:58 - 17:06)
2.0 update that&#39;s true I guess the 2.0 (17:03 - 17:10)
update does really help all users except (17:06 - 17:12)
us who don&#39;t have 340 sleep Styles yet (17:10 - 17:14)
so I can&#39;t go to that island but the (17:12 - 17:17)
ingredient the new ingredient and and I (17:14 - 17:23)
believe the spawns of Shinx grubbin and (17:17 - 17:26)
Aeron there will be a point in time (17:23 - 17:28)
where they&#39;re also on other Islands (17:26 - 17:30)
right yep like green grass or something (17:28 - 17:35)
for so uh shins Aon and grubbin will (17:30 - 17:36)
appear on green grass for a two week (17:35 - 17:39)
long event you will get Aeron shins (17:36 - 17:41)
Grubb and incense by completing the (17:39 - 17:44)
missions uh the event will run from (17:41 - 17:48)
Monday October 7th through October 21st (17:44 - 17:50)
same with the missions you will go to (17:48 - 17:53)
either Greengrass aisle or the old Power (17:50 - 17:54)
Plant whichever one you (17:53 - 17:57)
want and (17:54 - 18:00)
then uh slightly greater appearance of (17:57 - 18:03)
Aon Shin grubbin on (18:00 - 18:06)
that I don&#39;t know um you know when when (18:03 - 18:08)
when lapis lapis did the same thing when (18:06 - 18:11)
it debuted and I want to say that the (18:08 - 18:16)
people who went to lapis for the (18:11 - 18:19)
event I want to say they said they (18:16 - 18:21)
regretted it because lapis was so hard (18:19 - 18:23)
they just wished they would have went (18:21 - 18:26)
back to green grass to yes that&#39;s (18:23 - 18:27)
definitely what (18:26 - 18:29)
happened lapis was too hard you weren&#39;t (18:27 - 18:31)
able to get the Sleep Styles you wanted (18:29 - 18:32)
you weren&#39;t able to catch the Pokemon (18:31 - 18:36)
that you wanted to see right right so (18:32 - 18:38)
it&#39;s understandable I could if you&#39;re (18:36 - 18:40)
like a a hardcore player I could see (18:38 - 18:42)
people like myself what I&#39;m I&#39;m probably (18:40 - 18:44)
going to switch to Gold power plant when (18:42 - 18:47)
it comes out to get the 5% for the first (18:44 - 18:50)
week and just to see it and I&#39;ll (18:47 - 18:53)
probably do green grass those two weeks (18:50 - 18:55)
but at the end like on Sunday night I (18:53 - 18:58)
will easy ticket back to Power Plant to (18:55 - 19:01)
then Force the 5% to go (18:58 - 19:05)
there um cuz I know like if you complete (19:01 - 19:09)
green grass it&#39;ll like give 5% to (19:05 - 19:10)
another area but it&#39;s probably going to (19:09 - 19:11)
give it to (19:10 - 19:14)
Tundra cuz my Tundra I never go to (19:11 - 19:17)
Tundra so I would rather have (19:14 - 19:22)
like free 10% to power plant just after (19:17 - 19:24)
the green grass by and I have so many (19:22 - 19:29)
easy travel tickets that it&#39;s it&#39;s fine (19:24 - 19:29)
um okay well that&#39;s this that&#39;s the (19:30 - 19:35)
sleep stuff uh before we get to Jakarta (19:32 - 19:40)
or Inon um TCG Live (19:35 - 19:45)
Pocket is available in Early Access I (19:40 - 19:47)
don&#39;t know what the word they&#39;re using (19:45 - 19:49)
for it um soft launch I think is maybe (19:47 - 19:53)
what they said in New (19:49 - 19:56)
Zealand um Bobby you want to tell us (19:53 - 19:59)
what&#39;s happening there (19:56 - 20:02)
to be clear I&#39;m not I have not played in (19:59 - 20:07)
New Zealand in this game uh but uh I do (20:02 - 20:09)
know that the game is working I mean it (20:07 - 20:13)
is it&#39;s fully working in New Zealand and (20:09 - 20:16)
people are if you are in New Zealand uh (20:13 - 20:19)
you are able to download the game and (20:16 - 20:21)
open packs battle other people do the (20:19 - 20:25)
Wonder pick stuff like the game seems to (20:21 - 20:27)
be in its entirety is working in New (20:25 - 20:29)
Zealand as like um as you said Like An (20:27 - 20:31)
Early Access or I think they&#39;re yeah (20:29 - 20:33)
you&#39;re using the term soft soft launch (20:31 - 20:36)
maybe guess what but yeah comicbook.com (20:33 - 20:39)
and Pokey Beach have used the both the (20:36 - 20:40)
terms soft (20:39 - 20:44)
launch yeah and I do believe that Joe (20:40 - 20:47)
sby or SB Joe whatever we&#39;re whichever (20:44 - 20:48)
yeah he lives in New Zealand now (20:47 - 20:51)
apparently I didn&#39;t knowed the entire (20:48 - 20:52)
game (20:51 - 20:55)
so you know I thought Joe was the first (20:52 - 20:59)
time a proud UK resident I didn&#39;t know (20:55 - 21:02)
he just suddenly moved to New Zealand (20:59 - 21:06)
yeah I mean I will say that the the (21:02 - 21:09)
Pokemon I want to say sleep the Pokemon (21:06 - 21:13)
pocket like Twitter account is kind of (21:09 - 21:17)
like uh egging it on they they did say (21:13 - 21:19)
like welcome you know people in New (21:17 - 21:23)
Zealand and New Zealand like new New (21:19 - 21:25)
Zealand residents or something like that (21:23 - 21:30)
in their tweet so they seem to be (21:25 - 21:32)
egging on people they seem to be happy (21:30 - 21:34)
that people are excited about this game (21:32 - 21:37)
yeah I mean it&#39;s cool that they&#39;re (21:34 - 21:41)
getting it early uh yeah (21:37 - 21:45)
I I this is not because like I&#39;m a (21:41 - 21:50)
Pokemon Creator and I&#39;m like upset that (21:45 - 21:52)
I&#39;m not playing it I think I think you (21:50 - 21:55)
could take it that way cuz like when (21:52 - 21:57)
when like scarlet and violet or sword (21:55 - 21:59)
and shield or Legends came out all of a (21:57 - 22:01)
sudden people are like switching over to (21:59 - 22:03)
their Australian accounts or their (22:01 - 22:05)
Japanese accounts to play the game like (22:03 - 22:08)
14 hours earlier or something like that (22:05 - 22:09)
and (22:08 - 22:12)
there you could debate there&#39;s value in (22:09 - 22:13)
that as a content creator to be like (22:12 - 22:15)
well I can get my content up like 10 (22:13 - 22:17)
hours earlier than everyone else and (22:15 - 22:19)
then maybe My Views will be better or (22:17 - 22:23)
maybe I&#39;ll make more money um the (22:19 - 22:24)
there&#39;s probably it probably does work (22:23 - 22:26)
for some people it doesn&#39;t work for (22:24 - 22:28)
other people right like I&#39;ve seen so (22:26 - 22:30)
many small content creators like switch (22:28 - 22:32)
to Japan to get it early and like it (22:30 - 22:34)
doesn&#39;t matter like it doesn&#39;t like (22:32 - 22:36)
suddenly like explode them into like the (22:34 - 22:38)
next poke man or the next ninja or (22:36 - 22:40)
something just because they like started (22:38 - 22:44)
playing 10 hours early but anyways I (22:40 - 22:46)
just (22:44 - 22:51)
dislike non worldwide releases for games (22:46 - 22:55)
um I just like Destiny or there&#39;s a (22:51 - 22:56)
bunch of games but I&#39;ll use Destiny for (22:55 - 22:59)
example when like Destiny 2 came came (22:56 - 23:03)
out it was like 1:00 a.m. Central Time (22:59 - 23:07)
12:00 p.m. Japan time like 700 a.m. like (23:03 - 23:09)
it was just it came out at the same time (23:07 - 23:10)
for (23:09 - 23:13)
everyone and that&#39;s like a cool feeling (23:10 - 23:16)
like everyone&#39;s playing at the same time (23:13 - 23:20)
versus like oh Japan&#39;s playing archus I (23:16 - 23:22)
have to wait 10 more hours like that&#39;s (23:20 - 23:26)
just kind of sucks yeah you get to be (23:22 - 23:28)
you get to feel like part of this like (23:26 - 23:29)
worldwide community when it&#39;s all (23:28 - 23:31)
happening at the same time and (23:29 - 23:33)
especially with how prominent social (23:31 - 23:35)
media is nowadays you know you get to be (23:33 - 23:37)
a part of that right if we&#39;re all either (23:35 - 23:39)
scrolling on something and watching (23:37 - 23:41)
other people play this game that we have (23:39 - 23:44)
no access to and there&#39;s a little bit of (23:41 - 23:45)
like well I want to be able to do that (23:44 - 23:46)
or like but I I want to be able to be (23:45 - 23:49)
part of the conversation or part of the (23:46 - 23:51)
part of what&#39;s going on right now it (23:49 - 23:52)
helps keep the hype going to keep (23:51 - 23:57)
everyone in sync yeah exactly and I I (23:52 - 23:59)
and again speaking as like a okay so (23:57 - 24:00)
that was my personal opinion but like (23:59 - 24:03)
speaking at as content (24:00 - 24:06)
creator I don&#39;t want to like I think (24:03 - 24:07)
there&#39;s there&#39;s a difference between (24:06 - 24:08)
like posting an early preview right I (24:07 - 24:10)
like played the game early I played it (24:08 - 24:12)
for like two hours I answered as many (24:10 - 24:13)
questions as I could that people had (24:12 - 24:16)
about it and I&#39;m excited I think you (24:13 - 24:18)
know people who listen to the podcast or (24:16 - 24:20)
watch on YouTube they&#39;re excited but if (24:18 - 24:23)
I was like VPN over all of a sudden I (24:20 - 24:25)
live in New Zealand and like I&#39;ve (24:23 - 24:27)
completed the (24:25 - 24:29)
game that other people maybe not (24:27 - 24:32)
techsavvy enough or don&#39;t want to do (24:29 - 24:33)
that (24:32 - 24:36)
or like they&#39;re like I still have to (24:33 - 24:39)
wait this is annoying or like there&#39;s (24:36 - 24:42)
just something about it where it&#39;s like (24:39 - 24:43)
I don&#39;t want to say it doesn&#39;t it (24:42 - 24:46)
doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t want to say it feels (24:43 - 24:52)
unfair but it does feel (24:46 - 24:52)
like uh fragment fra frag like it yeah (24:54 - 25:04)
yeah yeah I no no I I know what you mean (24:59 - 25:07)
and I think part of it is how early it (25:04 - 25:10)
is so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s over I mean I (25:07 - 25:12)
guess as this podcast will be released (25:10 - 25:14)
it is it will be a month um until you (25:12 - 25:17)
know the game is uh released (25:14 - 25:20)
worldwide but even with the releases (25:17 - 25:21)
that (25:20 - 25:24)
happen just on the same day but New (25:21 - 25:27)
Zealand happens to be in my case about (25:24 - 25:29)
17 hours ahead so like when you know (25:27 - 25:32)
Legends came out or when Scarlet Violet (25:29 - 25:34)
came out at 17 hours you know 17 hours (25:32 - 25:37)
ahead of me that&#39;s fine right it&#39;s like (25:34 - 25:39)
that weekend everyone is a part of the (25:37 - 25:41)
conversation by the end of that weekend (25:39 - 25:42)
everyone&#39;s a part of the conversation (25:41 - 25:44)
and you are kind of all on This Global (25:42 - 25:47)
level all playing the game together and (25:44 - 25:51)
that&#39;s fine but this is a month Ahad of (25:47 - 25:54)
time that&#39;s a lot of time between the (25:51 - 25:57)
rest of the world playing a game and one (25:54 - 26:00)
place playing the game (25:57 - 26:03)
and I mean I know there was like Early (26:00 - 26:05)
Access stuff with say like Pokemon go (26:03 - 26:07)
right I mean there was like a beta there (26:05 - 26:08)
was like a whole I remember that before (26:07 - 26:12)
the game came out but I don&#39;t know it (26:08 - 26:13)
part of it makes me (26:12 - 26:16)
think did they like why do they feel (26:13 - 26:18)
like they needed to do an early access a (26:16 - 26:22)
month early for this cuz I mean when (26:18 - 26:24)
let&#39;s say like when TCG live did their (26:22 - 26:27)
Early Access thing right that that was (26:24 - 26:29)
cuz they wanted a lot of feedback (26:27 - 26:33)
and it was necessary as we all saw kind (26:29 - 26:38)
of play out this just based on your (26:33 - 26:40)
review and other creators reviews when (26:38 - 26:43)
they actually did go and kind of play (26:40 - 26:44)
the game and get an idea get First (26:43 - 26:47)
Impressions and everything it didn&#39;t (26:44 - 26:50)
spell out like they would then want to (26:47 - 26:52)
do a monthlong Early Access where I feel (26:50 - 26:53)
like what they&#39;re going to be looking (26:52 - 26:56)
for with this is a lot of feedback on (26:53 - 26:59)
the game that maybe they&#39;re (26:56 - 27:02)
I don&#39;t know it feels like a weird place (26:59 - 27:04)
to have a month-long Early Access to me (27:02 - 27:07)
but maybe I&#39;m I mean a monthl long Early (27:04 - 27:10)
Access feels kind of weird for for a (27:07 - 27:13)
Pokemon mobile game to begin with I feel (27:10 - 27:17)
like they are not usually this long even (27:13 - 27:20)
with Pokemon go releasing new features (27:17 - 27:22)
and things that&#39;s I don&#39;t think it&#39;s (27:20 - 27:24)
usually a month ahead of time I could be (27:22 - 27:27)
wrong again Pokemon go does like some (27:24 - 27:29)
early stuff in New Zealand and it&#39;s (27:27 - 27:31)
necessary we all see the reasons that (27:29 - 27:34)
they do Early Access stuff in New (27:31 - 27:36)
Zealand and I feel bad for New Zealand (27:34 - 27:38)
because they do end up getting hit with (27:36 - 27:41)
a lot of bugs and a lot of missed (27:38 - 27:43)
opportunities and they have to keep (27:41 - 27:45)
getting repeat events over there and (27:43 - 27:47)
things like that with Pokemon go (27:45 - 27:49)
specifically because things get messed (27:47 - 27:52)
up I feel that I feel for that but uh I (27:49 - 27:54)
don&#39;t know whenever I hear that there&#39;s (27:52 - 27:57)
this early access it&#39;s it (27:54 - 28:00)
usually you start to see why there is (27:57 - 28:02)
Early Access and from what I&#39;ve seen so (28:00 - 28:05)
far it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s really (28:02 - 28:07)
any issues with this game it&#39;s just a (28:05 - 28:09)
lot of people saying this is awesome (28:07 - 28:11)
they could wanted to make sure it was (28:09 - 28:14)
stable even with that many new players (28:11 - 28:17)
playing true that&#39;s true and just see (28:14 - 28:20)
how it does with uh however many players (28:17 - 28:22)
there are in New Zealand and however (28:20 - 28:24)
many players there are VPN into New (28:22 - 28:28)
Zealand combined um before releasing it (28:24 - 28:30)
to the rest of the world yeah it kind of (28:28 - 28:34)
reminds me of like preex and Y where you (28:30 - 28:37)
know I was gez we were we were still (28:34 - 28:40)
doing the podcast pre X and Y so you (28:37 - 28:42)
know black and white came out in Japan (28:40 - 28:45)
and then everyone else had to wait eight (28:42 - 28:49)
nine months for it to come out to that (28:45 - 28:51)
and so you&#39;re like looking at these (28:49 - 28:53)
Pokemon and you&#39;re like this looks so (28:51 - 28:54)
cool obviously there was a different (28:53 - 28:56)
time back then social media wasn&#39;t as (28:54 - 28:59)
there was no Tik Tok back then right (28:56 - 28:59)
there (28:59 - 29:04)
was it was barely it it was you it was (28:59 - 29:07)
the norm to be like okay we just got to (29:04 - 29:09)
wait for this game to get localized and (29:07 - 29:10)
come to America and everything and then (29:09 - 29:12)
X and Y like everyone was getting It (29:10 - 29:14)
ultimately the same time I think (29:12 - 29:16)
technically like Australia got it like (29:14 - 29:19)
two days later but like the same time (29:16 - 29:22)
frame and now it&#39;s like what you said (29:19 - 29:25)
earlier Bobby like Mr Joe Cab is done (29:22 - 29:28)
don&#39;t know how much money he spent in (29:25 - 29:31)
the two days to get it done but he is (29:28 - 29:33)
done with the whole game he has all he (29:31 - 29:36)
has all the cards which spoiler I can I (29:33 - 29:38)
without even playing it because I don&#39;t (29:36 - 29:39)
I don&#39;t have it I just said I don&#39;t have (29:38 - 29:42)
it you spend you spend a lot of money to (29:39 - 29:44)
then open all those cards and and get (29:42 - 29:49)
everything right yeah but (29:44 - 29:49)
like there&#39;s no there&#39;s no secrets if (29:49 - 29:54)
you want to go out there you can see all (29:52 - 29:55)
of those cards just like before black (29:54 - 29:57)
and white came to the United States you (29:55 - 30:01)
can see all 156 Pokemon before they come (29:57 - 30:06)
out and I think there is a little bit of (30:01 - 30:07)
I know the comments are going to be like (30:06 - 30:09)
well just don&#39;t look but when you&#39;re (30:07 - 30:10)
scrolling on Tik Tok or Twitter or (30:09 - 30:12)
whatever sometimes that stuff pops up I (30:10 - 30:14)
didn&#39;t know there was like a a Mew card (30:12 - 30:16)
never saw that they didn&#39;t tell us about (30:14 - 30:18)
it there&#39;s a me there&#39;s a me card that&#39;s (30:16 - 30:20)
really cool I (30:18 - 30:22)
don&#39;t now all of you know there&#39;s a me (30:20 - 30:24)
card you don&#39;t I guess I guess you don&#39;t (30:22 - 30:26)
know what it looks (30:24 - 30:28)
like I know what it looks like cuz it (30:26 - 30:29)
just appeared on my Twitter feed and I (30:28 - 30:31)
was like oh I didn&#39;t know this was a (30:29 - 30:33)
thing um exactly and now it&#39;s appeared (30:31 - 30:36)
on my Twitter feed 47 times because I or (30:33 - 30:38)
on threads because this is the way (30:36 - 30:40)
threads work so I clicked on one on (30:38 - 30:42)
probably on accident and now every post (30:40 - 30:45)
is the m card because things I want to (30:42 - 30:48)
see it so it&#39;s (30:45 - 30:51)
it&#39;s it would have been cool if like the (30:48 - 30:53)
everyone would have been able to (30:51 - 30:55)
experience that at the same time of like (30:53 - 30:58)
oh my gosh there&#39;s how almost like you (30:55 - 31:03)
know in in um the DLC like it did feel (30:58 - 31:04)
like there was a full week of people (31:03 - 31:07)
trying to figure out how to get Meloetta (31:04 - 31:09)
to appear and that was like slightly fun (31:07 - 31:11)
to see people be like wellow this is (31:09 - 31:14)
what I tried and that didn&#39;t (31:11 - 31:18)
work yeah and it&#39;s like weird yeah I I (31:14 - 31:19)
feel (31:18 - 31:21)
like how this kind of sounds too is it (31:19 - 31:23)
it almost sounds like we&#39;re sitting here (31:21 - 31:25)
like this I want to be playing it right (31:23 - 31:27)
now right and like the thing is like (31:25 - 31:28)
three of us could absolutely do that (31:27 - 31:32)
like we all have the ability to one set (31:28 - 31:35)
up a New Zealand Apple account two VPN (31:32 - 31:37)
we all know how to do this right like (31:35 - 31:38)
the three of us all know how to do this (31:37 - 31:42)
we literally ran VPN ads on the show at (31:38 - 31:46)
one point so like yes we are aware that (31:42 - 31:48)
we could absolutely do this and play the (31:46 - 31:50)
game but it&#39;s a little bit more than (31:48 - 31:52)
that it&#39;s it&#39;s just the idea that there (31:50 - 31:54)
are a lot of people who one can&#39;t do (31:52 - 31:57)
that two might like won&#39;t do that or (31:54 - 32:01)
just wouldn&#39;t how to do that and I don&#39;t (31:57 - 32:03)
know it&#39;s still something about it that (32:01 - 32:08)
is that is definitely weird to me and (32:03 - 32:10)
like I again I don&#39;t like I&#39;m not I (32:08 - 32:13)
don&#39;t mind seeing the stuff I&#39;m seeing I (32:10 - 32:15)
that&#39;s fine like cool people are playing (32:13 - 32:19)
it great but it just seems weird that it (32:15 - 32:24)
is you know in one spot for an entire (32:19 - 32:27)
month before even even from a marketing (32:24 - 32:29)
standpoint like when I&#39;m it is true (32:27 - 32:31)
you&#39;re getting a lot of hype up before (32:29 - 32:33)
the game comes out but you&#39;ve kind of (32:31 - 32:37)
now lost your like hype of the release (32:33 - 32:39)
when it actually comes out the people (32:37 - 32:40)
who are going to be generating the most (32:39 - 32:43)
hype have already generated all of that (32:40 - 32:46)
hype by the time the game actually comes (32:43 - 32:50)
out not all of the people but clearly a (32:46 - 32:53)
lot of people like Joe have been getting (32:50 - 32:56)
all of their Pokemon pocket stuff out of (32:53 - 32:59)
the way now and what&#39;s going to happen (32:56 - 33:01)
when the game actually comes out for a (32:59 - 33:04)
lot of people you know and I don&#39;t even (33:01 - 33:06)
and even in that way in that sense I (33:04 - 33:09)
don&#39;t like I don&#39;t blame Joe for doing (33:06 - 33:11)
that because to the to his to what he (33:09 - 33:13)
for what he does there is a bunch of (33:11 - 33:15)
people who are playing the game right (33:13 - 33:17)
now and there&#39;s a bunch of people who (33:15 - 33:20)
are going to go to sarabe to to be like (33:17 - 33:23)
Joe may not the best example you know so (33:20 - 33:25)
like he is you know he that&#39;s his that&#39;s (33:23 - 33:28)
his like job and so kind of makes sense (33:25 - 33:30)
that he like got it all together and now (33:28 - 33:32)
there&#39;s a place that people who are (33:30 - 33:35)
playing the game for the next month can (33:32 - 33:37)
go to I don&#39;t know there&#39;s not a whole (33:35 - 33:39)
lot to like research in the same way (33:37 - 33:40)
have like a Pokemon game where you would (33:39 - 33:42)
look for like different you know areas (33:40 - 33:45)
things get you can hope you will get (33:42 - 33:48)
you&#39;ll pull a specific card yeah or just (33:45 - 33:49)
even like see mechanics and things like (33:48 - 33:52)
that that you know you may not be like (33:49 - 33:54)
right up front and explained that easily (33:52 - 33:57)
in the game things like that so I get it (33:54 - 33:59)
like and that&#39;s fine but again it&#39;s just (33:57 - 34:02)
it&#39;s just weird on the side of them (33:59 - 34:06)
releasing it at all a month early uh (34:02 - 34:08)
seems odd just because I don&#39;t feel like (34:06 - 34:11)
it&#39;s typical of Pokemon mobile game like (34:08 - 34:13)
again I don&#39;t like was unite released (34:11 - 34:17)
early was Masters released early was uh (34:13 - 34:20)
think released early like I I don&#39;t (34:17 - 34:22)
think Masters was I&#39;m pretty sure unite (34:20 - 34:24)
did have yeah unite might good extended (34:22 - 34:27)
period yeah they may have I think unite (34:24 - 34:29)
had early in China didn&#39;t it not yeah (34:27 - 34:33)
I&#39;m pretty sure it did okay um I think (34:29 - 34:35)
like that yeah I remember when Pokemon (34:33 - 34:39)
go came out um early the thing about (34:35 - 34:41)
Pokemon go was your account was going to (34:39 - 34:42)
be (34:41 - 34:45)
reset and they were they were resetting (34:42 - 34:48)
accounts almost I I could be wrong but (34:45 - 34:50)
there Pokemon go is eight years old I (34:48 - 34:52)
can barely remember last week but I want (34:50 - 34:54)
to say they they there was multiple (34:52 - 34:56)
reset periods of (34:54 - 34:59)
like uh (34:56 - 35:00)
June 30th we&#39;re resetting everyone&#39;s (34:59 - 35:02)
account uh June 5th we&#39;re resetting (35:00 - 35:04)
everyone&#39;s account again like they they (35:02 - 35:07)
did reset multiple times before (35:04 - 35:12)
release and I I guess (35:07 - 35:16)
like if they turned off the (35:12 - 35:18)
store and they said okay this game&#39;s (35:16 - 35:21)
going to be out for 30 days to test (35:18 - 35:23)
things you can&#39;t spend anything because (35:21 - 35:25)
we are resetting your accounts I think (35:23 - 35:28)
you would see significantly less people (35:25 - 35:30)
make a VPN and switch over because they (35:28 - 35:33)
would be like oh why why would I play my (35:30 - 35:35)
account&#39;s going to get reset but I could (35:33 - 35:37)
see people say like that&#39;s okay I just (35:35 - 35:38)
want to like I just want to play with (35:37 - 35:41)
the game for like an hour yeah and I&#39;m (35:38 - 35:42)
cool with it like (35:41 - 35:45)
resetting it&#39;s just (35:42 - 35:48)
like very weird to be like jump through (35:45 - 35:52)
all of these loopholes to give us (35:48 - 35:55)
$200 and now you&#39;re done with the game (35:52 - 35:56)
and when it comes out on the when it (35:55 - 35:59)
comes out in 30 days (35:56 - 36:00)
there&#39;s nothing for you to do because (35:59 - 36:02)
we&#39;re not adding anything (36:00 - 36:05)
different right right yeah and people (36:02 - 36:07)
are spending money I mean people are (36:05 - 36:09)
spending a lot of money at this point (36:07 - 36:11)
and they can spend money they can buy (36:09 - 36:13)
the premium pass they can do all the (36:11 - 36:14)
things that the (36:13 - 36:17)
game will allow people to do come day (36:14 - 36:22)
one uh so that is happening I I think I (36:17 - 36:24)
I think the one of the reasons why I (36:22 - 36:25)
think it&#39;s weird we talked about a lot (36:24 - 36:30)
of reasons is I I I think I feel for the (36:25 - 36:31)
free-to-play players the most because (36:30 - 36:35)
that&#39;s like 60 free booster packs they (36:31 - 36:38)
could have gotten two a day for 30 days (36:35 - 36:40)
long period of time to miss out while (36:38 - 36:42)
everybody who is playing is building (36:40 - 36:44)
their collection yeah so for somebody (36:42 - 36:48)
who maybe is not techsavvy don&#39;t have (36:44 - 36:51)
the resources they or just doesn&#39;t want (36:48 - 36:53)
to yeah and they they do they&#39;re really (36:51 - 36:56)
excited for this game it&#39;s like well (36:53 - 36:57)
that (36:56 - 36:59)
sucks you just that&#39;s like 60 booster (36:57 - 37:01)
packs you&#39;re not getting compared to (36:59 - 37:04)
somebody else who yeah and no shade to (37:01 - 37:07)
anyone who lives in New Zealand you guys (37:04 - 37:09)
deserve something you you definitely (37:07 - 37:12)
deserve something early for sure the way (37:09 - 37:15)
that nian is treated you I&#39;m glad this (37:12 - 37:18)
other Pokemon game is maybe treating you (37:15 - 37:22)
better that is true that is true uh also (37:18 - 37:25)
on the side of like terms of service and (37:22 - 37:26)
stuff when it comes to like Apple at (37:25 - 37:29)
least I&#39;m just going to say apple cuz I (37:26 - 37:30)
I&#39;m an apple person so I&#39;m going to go (37:29 - 37:32)
with apple when I talk about these (37:30 - 37:34)
things I I don&#39;t know what the terms of (37:32 - 37:37)
service say about setting up an account (37:34 - 37:39)
I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that there would (37:37 - 37:40)
be an issue with that on Apple side but (37:39 - 37:42)
I don&#39;t know like I don&#39;t know what (37:40 - 37:44)
Apple says about setting up an account (37:42 - 37:46)
in another country because you do have (37:44 - 37:48)
to do that and I&#39;ve seen that a lot with (37:46 - 37:49)
a lot of things that aren&#39;t related to (37:48 - 37:52)
games I&#39;ve seen it with apps as well and (37:49 - 37:54)
with other things um but I don&#39;t know (37:52 - 37:56)
what the terms of service say for apple (37:54 - 37:59)
or I guess Google for like setting up an (37:56 - 38:01)
account in another country that you&#39;re (37:59 - 38:05)
not actually a resident of again I&#39;m not (38:01 - 38:06)
saying that there&#39;s anything wrong I (38:05 - 38:09)
have no idea so I would be more (38:06 - 38:11)
interested to know if the pocket terms (38:09 - 38:14)
of service is against it because my (38:11 - 38:17)
guess is they would be considering how (38:14 - 38:19)
you are going to be able to trade cards (38:17 - 38:22)
in different languages but then they (38:19 - 38:24)
shouldn&#39;t be tweeting to like egg people (38:22 - 38:26)
onto doing it don&#39;t expect even if (38:24 - 38:28)
lawyers say (38:26 - 38:30)
I know that this is something people (38:28 - 38:31)
shouldn&#39;t do that doesn&#39;t mean that (38:30 - 38:33)
everybody at the company is going to be (38:31 - 38:36)
right in lock step with the lawyers I (38:33 - 38:38)
know but they&#39;re pretty Pokemon things (38:36 - 38:40)
are pretty locked like when it&#39;s Pokemon (38:38 - 38:41)
related stuff I feel like that&#39;s pretty (38:40 - 38:44)
locked down before they&#39;re making tweets (38:41 - 38:46)
and posts and things about stuff like (38:44 - 38:49)
that I mean like Technically when you (38:46 - 38:51)
play Pokemon go you&#39;re agreeing to only (38:49 - 38:53)
play the game on one device and have one (38:51 - 38:55)
account and (38:53 - 38:58)
I literally on my stream yesterday there (38:55 - 39:00)
a Korean guy I traded with was like I (38:58 - 39:02)
normally play with eight accounts but (39:00 - 39:04)
today I&#39;m only playing with four and he (39:02 - 39:06)
has like three phones and one of the (39:04 - 39:08)
phones had like two accounts stacked on (39:06 - 39:10)
each other I like dang that&#39;s kind of (39:08 - 39:13)
cool actually that&#39;s always cool to see (39:10 - 39:18)
like famous photos of Pokemon go players (39:13 - 39:21)
um I guess my question is somebody who (39:18 - 39:23)
i&#39; I&#39;ve had like an Apple account since (39:21 - 39:25)
I&#39;ve been like 16 or whatever it&#39;s been (39:23 - 39:27)
the same Apple account I could see that (39:25 - 39:30)
I downloaded (39:27 - 39:33)
like like the the beer app when that was (39:30 - 39:35)
like one of the first apps where you (39:33 - 39:37)
like pour it right like I could go back (39:35 - 39:40)
through my Apple history and see the the (39:37 - 39:42)
the lighter app where all it does is (39:40 - 39:44)
like make a little flame on your phone (39:42 - 39:49)
right like I remember this um I don&#39;t so (39:44 - 39:51)
if you make a whole another Apple (39:49 - 39:54)
account a New Zealand Apple account to (39:51 - 39:56)
then get pocket and you&#39;re putting money (39:54 - 39:58)
there (39:56 - 40:01)
are you then stuck to keep putting money (39:58 - 40:03)
there because you can&#39;t transfer it to a (40:01 - 40:07)
different Apple ID no I&#39;m almost 100% (40:03 - 40:09)
sure it&#39;s a new account completely so (40:07 - 40:12)
you&#39;re forever locked into two (40:09 - 40:15)
accounts going forward I don&#39;t know on (40:12 - 40:18)
the Google side but on the Apple side I (40:15 - 40:21)
am fairly certain that&#39;s true you have (40:18 - 40:24)
to because you can&#39;t have an Apple ID in (40:21 - 40:28)
multiple countries um and there&#39;s I (40:24 - 40:30)
don&#39;t know how it works if you move like (40:28 - 40:31)
if I move to Europe I don&#39;t know how (40:30 - 40:35)
that works but uh my understanding is (40:31 - 40:37)
you can&#39;t like switch back and forth (40:35 - 40:39)
between you can&#39;t keep switching back (40:37 - 40:41)
and forth between countries that would (40:39 - 40:43)
that would bother me like all my (40:41 - 40:45)
transactions are under one Apple ID but (40:43 - 40:48)
for a whatever it would be this game a (40:45 - 40:50)
different game a different app to then (40:48 - 40:52)
be (40:50 - 40:52)
like oh I have to like switch Apple ID (40:53 - 40:58)
to then buy a put $100 in to then buy (40:55 - 40:59)
booster packs and then switch back like (40:58 - 41:01)
that just seems annoying transferring (40:59 - 41:05)
game data would work to fix that I&#39;m (41:01 - 41:07)
trying to (41:05 - 41:09)
that&#39;s yeah I don&#39;t know if you could (41:07 - 41:11)
transfer the game data to then get away (41:09 - 41:15)
from that Apple ID (41:11 - 41:17)
yeah you might be able to depending on (41:15 - 41:19)
how it&#39;s set up that&#39;s the YouTube video (41:17 - 41:22)
somebody should be (41:19 - 41:22)
making yeah seriously um because I don&#39;t (41:22 - 41:27)
yeah I don&#39;t know the full answer answer (41:26 - 41:30)
to that I will say even if it is like (41:27 - 41:33)
possible it is not easy it&#39;s a (41:30 - 41:36)
complicated process when you are (41:33 - 41:38)
switching between countries and things (41:36 - 41:40)
like that with your account and I I can (41:38 - 41:42)
imagine because there are apps that are (41:40 - 41:45)
not in other countries and things like (41:42 - 41:46)
that as well (41:45 - 41:49)
so I don&#39;t even if it is Poss if it is (41:46 - 41:52)
possible to do it I imagine it is a (41:49 - 41:56)
complicated process to do it uh I (41:52 - 41:58)
thought you looked into this Bobby I (41:56 - 42:01)
thought you knew step by step I do not (41:58 - 42:03)
know the step by step of switching I was (42:01 - 42:05)
I knew a step by step of setting up a (42:03 - 42:07)
new Apple ID in a different country but (42:05 - 42:09)
I don&#39;t know about like your current one (42:07 - 42:13)
because um I wouldn&#39;t want to try to (42:09 - 42:15)
mess with my current Apple ID because (42:13 - 42:18)
that in itself you start messing with (42:15 - 42:19)
Apple ID and iCloud and everything (42:18 - 42:22)
that&#39;s connected and I don&#39;t want to end (42:19 - 42:24)
up with like yeah my contacts (42:22 - 42:26)
downloading 60 times or whatever like I (42:24 - 42:29)
don&#39;t want to end up in loophole it can (42:26 - 42:31)

from like Korean SIM card we we have a (42:57 - 43:02)
list there&#39;s a I know there&#39;s like a (43:00 - 43:04)
portion of our chat where it&#39;s just (43:02 - 43:05)
Steve join the conversation Steve left (43:04 - 43:10)
the conversation like 25 times in a row (43:05 - 43:12)
it&#39;s like what (43:10 - 43:15)
happened SIM Card issues SIM Card issues (43:12 - 43:19)
happened yep I have a lot of SIM cards (43:15 - 43:22)
traveling okay uh speaking of traveling (43:19 - 43:24)
uh let&#39;s take a break and then when we (43:22 - 43:27)
get back we&#39;ll talk about uh the (43:24 - 43:29)
Indonesia event which I thought was a (43:27 - 43:32)
Pokémon go event but was actually not a (43:29 - 43:36)
Pokémon go event so we will be right (43:32 - 43:39)
back and we are back from our break uh (43:36 - 43:43)
let&#39;s start off with Indonesia uh so the (43:39 - 43:47)
difference here is Indonesia was a city (43:43 - 43:53)
Safari experience and inan is a safari (43:47 - 43:56)
zone experience and they are pretty (43:53 - 43:57)
different (43:56 - 44:01)
I I I&#39;m still shocked (43:57 - 44:03)
that the two (44:01 - 44:07)
exist at the same time yeah at the same (44:03 - 44:11)
time I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been to two I&#39;ve been to (44:07 - 44:13)
three Safari (44:11 - 44:17)
zones I went to the St Louis one I went (44:13 - 44:19)
to goyang which was also in South Korea (44:17 - 44:21)
and then obviously (44:19 - 44:25)
inchon and the things that I I guess I (44:21 - 44:26)
didn&#39;t realize because of the city (44:25 - 44:27)
Safari I&#39;m going to try to L out the (44:26 - 44:30)
differences is (44:27 - 44:34)
the Safari Zone is all in a park that (44:30 - 44:37)
you&#39;re playing in and from what I (44:34 - 44:39)
remember there was there&#39;s no egg (44:37 - 44:43)
bonuses there&#39;s no raid lover (44:39 - 44:48)
bonuses um okay but it is I think I said (44:43 - 44:50)
this for goyang I will probably say this (44:48 - 44:52)
again like two years later it is like a (44:50 - 44:56)
glorified Community Day like thing like (44:52 - 44:59)
shiny odds are increased but not as good (44:56 - 45:02)
as commun day but also not as good as (44:59 - 45:06)
like um a go Fest full go Fest yeah okay (45:02 - 45:09)
and you like a commun day you are (45:06 - 45:12)
probably picking a park to walk in and (45:09 - 45:13)
then do that (45:12 - 45:16)
Park and for Community Day that&#39;s only (45:13 - 45:17)
like 3 (45:16 - 45:19)
hours and some people don&#39;t even play (45:17 - 45:24)
all three hours for this it&#39;s actually 9 (45:19 - 45:27)
hours it&#39;s um I thought it was going to (45:24 - 45:28)
be eight there&#39;s a lot of things I (45:27 - 45:30)
thought that was going to (45:28 - 45:33)
happen um but the difference here (45:30 - 45:36)
compared to goang or compared to St (45:33 - 45:39)
Louis Missouri is they added on the city (45:36 - 45:41)
experience so again you pick one day in (45:39 - 45:43)
the park and then your other two days (45:41 - 45:45)
can be anywhere in inchon and inchon (45:43 - 45:47)
like I said is the third biggest city in (45:45 - 45:49)
South Korea so there&#39;s plenty of places (45:47 - 45:52)
you could go and play I can&#39;t go to Soul (45:49 - 45:54)
which is definitely a bummer for people (45:52 - 45:57)
who have never been to Soul um cuz Sol (45:54 - 46:02)
is not inchon um now the the city (45:57 - 46:04)
experience in (46:02 - 46:10)
Indonesia Safari Pokemon Safari (46:04 - 46:10)
city city Safari City Safari that&#39;s it (46:10 - 46:17)
yeah City Safari is you can play (46:14 - 46:19)
anywhere in (46:17 - 46:21)
Jakarta which now you&#39;re like what (46:19 - 46:22)
didn&#39;t you just say you could play (46:21 - 46:26)
anywhere in inchon yes but there was no (46:22 - 46:30)
designated place to play at all there (46:26 - 46:33)
wasn&#39;t like please go here okay there (46:30 - 46:35)
were there was one in Barcelona there (46:33 - 46:38)
was one in Mexico City there was one in (46:35 - 46:42)
Soul that I went to and I really praised (46:38 - 46:44)
the soul one last year there&#39;s a lot of (46:42 - 46:46)
Korea here there I I praised the soul (46:44 - 46:49)
one last year because I I when I went I (46:46 - 46:50)
was (46:49 - 46:53)
like I I would like to do all the (46:50 - 46:55)
touristy things in Soul that I didn&#39;t do (46:53 - 46:56)
the first time cuz the first time I was (46:55 - 46:58)
in goyang so I had to keep going out to (46:56 - 47:00)
goyang to (46:58 - 47:04)
play and whoever was in charge of (47:00 - 47:05)
whatever Niantic employee was in charge (47:04 - 47:07)
of it which I actually met that guy (47:05 - 47:12)
super nice they laid out the Eevee Poké (47:07 - 47:16)
stops to then like take you through of (47:12 - 47:19)
the things you wanted to see in Soul as (47:16 - 47:22)
like a tourist and so you there was (47:19 - 47:25)
three locations ideally they wanted you (47:22 - 47:26)
to start at you didn&#39;t have to start at (47:25 - 47:31)
those and then you walked the city and (47:26 - 47:33)
were like oh this was on my thing to I (47:31 - 47:35)
wanted to see this I wanted to see this (47:33 - 47:37)
I wanted to see this I was told in like (47:35 - 47:41)
Barcelona and Mexico City that it wasn&#39;t (47:37 - 47:43)
the same treatment whoever was in charge (47:41 - 47:46)
of that just kind of scattered the stops (47:43 - 47:49)
which kind of maybe unveils how Niantic (47:46 - 47:51)
has different people in charge of (47:49 - 47:52)
different regions and maybe some people (47:51 - 47:55)
care about their job a lot more um I did (47:52 - 47:58)
go to Barcelona after after City (47:55 - 48:01)
Safari uh and the eveve stops are still (47:58 - 48:03)
there I don&#39;t know if people know this (48:01 - 48:05)
but like anytime there&#39;s a city (48:03 - 48:08)
Safari the stops will stay up for a full (48:05 - 48:10)
year and so if you travel to Mexico City (48:08 - 48:12)
or Barcelona after the fact you could (48:10 - 48:15)
pay a dollar to do the research and I (48:12 - 48:19)
don&#39;t know why I air quoted that um but (48:15 - 48:21)
you could still see the Eevee stops so (48:19 - 48:23)
when I was in Barcelona the Eevee stops (48:21 - 48:26)
I think were placed pretty well because (48:23 - 48:29)
anytime I to a touristy thing there was (48:26 - 48:31)
an Eevee stop there like if I got (48:29 - 48:33)
somewhere where I was like this seems (48:31 - 48:35)
very touristy I would open Pokemon go (48:33 - 48:37)
and for sure there would be an Eevee (48:35 - 48:39)
stop there so I&#39;ve only been told from (48:37 - 48:41)
people who went to Mexico City that it (48:39 - 48:43)
was just kind of (48:41 - 48:46)
scattered um there was no Eevee stops in (48:43 - 48:50)
inchon because that&#39;s a safari zone not (48:46 - 48:52)
a city Safari so there&#39;s the difference (48:50 - 48:54)
there there&#39;s no Eevee stops that guide (48:52 - 48:57)
you uh so there&#39;s no Safari Eevee (48:54 - 49:03)
sco was at both um uh and then in (48:57 - 49:03)
Jakarta even if the EV stops were placed (49:04 - 49:11)
where you would want to (49:08 - 49:13)
go I don&#39;t (49:11 - 49:18)
I I don&#39;t understand but also (49:13 - 49:21)
understand that I now get it that city (49:18 - 49:24)
is not walkable so you have a like (49:21 - 49:28)
explore the city when there are no (49:24 - 49:30)
sidewalks there&#39;s someone mentioned that (49:28 - 49:33)
didn&#39;t didn&#39;t I I feel somebody did (49:30 - 49:35)
mention that in the slack and I was like (49:33 - 49:38)
this is surprising I was like you&#39;re (49:35 - 49:42)
crazy this can&#39;t be possible and (49:38 - 49:46)
then okay my first night in Jakarta I I (49:42 - 49:49)
I like solo traveling a lot because um I (49:46 - 49:51)
hate bringing like a partner with me and (49:49 - 49:54)
then feeling bad that like I I have to (49:51 - 49:57)
work like I have to I have to get up (49:54 - 49:59)
early I have to put this backpack on I (49:57 - 50:02)
got to go film this content and I don&#39;t (49:59 - 50:04)
want you to feel like a Solo Traveler or (50:02 - 50:06)
like I left you in the hotel or (50:04 - 50:08)
something uh because like I again I like (50:06 - 50:09)
being a Solo Traveler I like being by (50:08 - 50:11)
myself but I don&#39;t want to put that on (50:09 - 50:13)
somebody else but I also like to (50:11 - 50:15)
experience different countries or I like (50:13 - 50:17)
to travel with people too is right to (50:15 - 50:20)
like share those experiences yeah but (50:17 - 50:22)
also it&#39;s nice to have somebody there to (50:20 - 50:25)
be like Let&#39;s Get Lost together it&#39;s not (50:22 - 50:28)
as bad cuz like uhhuh yeah we can figure (50:25 - 50:31)
that out so (50:28 - 50:35)
I I when I couldn&#39;t figure out the train (50:31 - 50:37)
system in when I got to the (50:35 - 50:40)
airport and I was like this just doesn&#39;t (50:37 - 50:42)
make sense every Apple Map Google Map (50:40 - 50:44)
everything is saying it&#39;s going to take (50:42 - 50:46)
two hours to get to my hotel from the (50:44 - 50:49)
train station and the the Uber which (50:46 - 50:50)
they call grab but I&#39;m just going to (50:49 - 50:52)
call it Uber for the sake of this (50:50 - 50:55)
conversation um The Uber was 45 (50:52 - 50:58)
minutes and I was like like 2 hours on (50:55 - 51:01)
the train or 45 minutes and I was like (50:58 - 51:02)
what&#39;s the price difference the train (51:01 - 51:05)
was $6 I was like okay that makes sense (51:02 - 51:06)
for public (51:05 - 51:10)
transportation and the Uber was (51:06 - 51:10)
$12 and I was (51:10 - 51:16)
like this this doesn&#39;t seem in New York (51:13 - 51:21)
to get like 20 minutes from from LGA to (51:16 - 51:25)
my hotel is a $100 in an Uber I know cuz (51:21 - 51:27)
I&#39;ve done it before (51:25 - 51:29)
because the Pokemon it&#39;s usually because (51:27 - 51:31)
the Pokemon company brings me out but (51:29 - 51:32)
they give me like uber vouchers so I (51:31 - 51:35)
never actually pay the (51:32 - 51:37)
$100 so I was like (51:35 - 51:39)
I&#39;ll I would like to just get to my (51:37 - 51:42)
hotel right I&#39;ve been flying for 20 (51:39 - 51:44)
hours I guess I&#39;ll spend the $12 and it (51:42 - 51:46)
worked it wor it was a it was a 45 (51:44 - 51:49)
minute Uber ride it was $12 exactly I (51:46 - 51:52)
got to my hotel I got very lucky they (51:49 - 51:54)
gave me an upgraded room cuz like (51:52 - 51:55)
literally no one booked that hotel I can (51:54 - 51:58)
tell you why because that was the wrong (51:55 - 52:01)
area to book a hotel (51:58 - 52:01)
in that&#39;s (52:02 - 52:08)
cool so I so I purposely booked this (52:05 - 52:11)
hotel near this huge mall and I thought (52:08 - 52:15)
to myself if it&#39;s raining huge Mall (52:11 - 52:18)
great place to play Pokemon go right uh (52:15 - 52:20)
if I need (52:18 - 52:25)
food mall if I need clothes mall right (52:20 - 52:27)
Steve only thinks of the mall of America (52:25 - 52:30)
when he thinks of mul so that&#39;s his (52:27 - 52:32)
that&#39;s what he&#39;s going off your (52:30 - 52:37)
reference when he thinks Maul so yeah so (52:32 - 52:41)
um so I get I get settled in the (52:37 - 52:46)
hotel change I go out and I don&#39;t know (52:41 - 52:48)
how to get out of like the (52:46 - 52:51)
valet like there like you know how you (52:48 - 52:53)
walk to the front of the (52:51 - 52:58)
hotel where cars drop off yeah to to to (52:53 - 53:00)
the the the (52:58 - 53:02)
right there&#39;s just Road there&#39;s no (53:00 - 53:05)
sidewalk it just it just goes out of (53:02 - 53:07)
like of a security gate that only cars (53:05 - 53:09)
can leave out of the security gate and (53:07 - 53:11)
then the left where we came (53:09 - 53:13)
in there was also security gates I don&#39;t (53:11 - 53:15)
know if people know this if when you go (53:13 - 53:18)
to Indonesia uh almost every every hotel (53:15 - 53:23)
in every um Mall from my experience my (53:18 - 53:26)
there there for 4 days they have to (53:23 - 53:29)
secure check every car or every person (53:26 - 53:31)
going into something so like when the (53:29 - 53:33)
car pulled up to drop me off they check (53:31 - 53:34)
the trunk they check the glove box they (53:33 - 53:36)
check the back seat and then they let (53:34 - 53:38)
the car in and then when I got dropped (53:36 - 53:41)
off all my bags had to go through uh (53:38 - 53:43)
x-ray machines and then I could go into (53:41 - 53:44)
the hotel so anytime I went into my (53:43 - 53:46)
hotel I had to get x-rayed anytime I (53:44 - 53:48)
went into any of the malls I had to get (53:46 - 53:52)
x-rayed um it&#39;s just because there was I (53:48 - 53:56)
believe um some terrorism like 10 years (53:52 - 53:57)
ago (53:56 - 53:59)
like that stacked up and so they started (53:57 - 54:01)
putting the security checks in measure (53:59 - 54:03)
to keep people there safe got (54:01 - 54:07)
it that&#39;s cool like Security check weird (54:03 - 54:09)
the first time CU you&#39;re like oh no what (54:07 - 54:11)
did I do wrong why are they checking the (54:09 - 54:13)
trunk you just get used to it so it&#39;s (54:11 - 54:18)
fine so um so I go to the left to like (54:13 - 54:21)
leave the hotel area which you&#39;re like (54:18 - 54:22)
it shouldn&#39;t be that hard to leave this (54:21 - 54:24)
hotel area and there&#39;s there is a (54:22 - 54:26)
sidewalk but Google Maps is telling me (54:24 - 54:28)
to go (54:26 - 54:31)
around and I try to go that way and the (54:28 - 54:33)
one the Sidewalk Ends and there&#39;s just (54:31 - 54:35)
this huge roundabout and when I say huge (54:33 - 54:38)
roundabout imagine like six Lane (54:35 - 54:41)
roundabout of people going around and (54:38 - 54:44)
I&#39;m like I can&#39;t cross there&#39;s nowhere (54:41 - 54:45)
there&#39;s no sidewalk anymore there&#39;s no (54:44 - 54:48)
crosswalk there&#39;s no sign so I have to (54:45 - 54:51)
walk the opposite direction the I want (54:48 - 54:53)
to stress the mall is literally across (54:51 - 54:56)
the street I can see it from my hotel (54:53 - 54:57)
room (54:56 - 55:00)
but the way Google Maps is telling me I (54:57 - 55:01)
can&#39;t go that way because it&#39;s just a (55:00 - 55:04)
huge multi-lane roundabout um and no one (55:01 - 55:07)
is stopping and so I have to walk four (55:04 - 55:10)
blocks down then cross to an (55:07 - 55:12)
intersection where I&#39;m waiting because (55:10 - 55:16)
there&#39;s buses going and then wait and (55:12 - 55:18)
then cross again and then walk three (55:16 - 55:20)
lanes up and then I don&#39;t even know how (55:18 - 55:22)
to get into the mall because the mall is (55:20 - 55:25)
set up like you like it will say no (55:22 - 55:29)
walking only car so like I can see that (55:25 - 55:31)
entrance to the mall but I&#39;m not in a (55:29 - 55:33)
car and I&#39;m not allowed to walk into (55:31 - 55:35)
that even though I can see the door to (55:33 - 55:38)
the mall only cars can go to that door (55:35 - 55:40)
to drop off you can only be dropped off (55:38 - 55:42)
at the door and then enter you cannot (55:40 - 55:43)
walk up to that door you&#39;re not allowed (55:42 - 55:44)
because you need to go through a (55:43 - 55:48)
specific walking only entrance so they (55:44 - 55:51)
can X-Ray Scan you right yeah so I have (55:48 - 55:54)
to walk around almost this entire Mall (55:51 - 55:55)
which is it&#39;s a big it&#39;s it&#39;s the (55:54 - 55:57)
biggest mall in part it&#39;s called the (55:55 - 55:58)
Grand (55:57 - 56:01)
Indonesia and the first night it&#39;s dark (55:58 - 56:03)
I&#39;m I (56:01 - 56:07)
spend several minutes trying to get in (56:03 - 56:09)
and I I just I just go back CU I was (56:07 - 56:11)
like I don&#39;t this entrance is car only (56:09 - 56:13)
this entrance is car (56:11 - 56:17)
only yeah and the next day when and the (56:13 - 56:19)
next day when it&#39;s like sunny and stuff (56:17 - 56:21)
I I just got room service that night (56:19 - 56:23)
which was also regrettable because it (56:21 - 56:25)
was too expensive and bad anyways the (56:23 - 56:28)
reason I&#39;m telling this story is this is (56:25 - 56:30)
all of (56:28 - 56:34)
Indonesia it&#39;s just sidewalks end (56:30 - 56:38)
or you you you you exit an area and (56:34 - 56:39)
you&#39;re (56:38 - 56:42)
like there&#39;s a park L Indonesia that you (56:39 - 56:44)
saw well I all of Jakarta at least oh (56:42 - 56:46)
sorry all of Jakarta yes yeah I was like (56:44 - 56:51)
Indonesia this is all of Jakarta yeah (56:46 - 56:54)
um and so the actual event so so you&#39;re (56:51 - 56:56)
like Steve why did you book this hotel (56:54 - 56:58)
is cuz Niantic put out a map and there (56:56 - 57:02)
are like here are eight places to play M (56:58 - 57:04)
like here are the touristy places so I (57:02 - 57:06)
picked my hotel in between like the (57:04 - 57:09)
three of the touristy places (57:06 - 57:13)
MH um and one of the places was a (57:09 - 57:15)
different Mall which was called Central (57:13 - 57:17)
Park Mall which is funny because the (57:15 - 57:18)
park here (57:17 - 57:22)
in in inchon is also called Central Park (57:18 - 57:23)
but there&#39;s two there&#39;s Central Park 1 (57:22 - 57:25)
and Central Park 2 here in inchon so (57:23 - 57:27)
Central Park Mall was one of the main (57:25 - 57:30)
places to play which again was also very (57:27 - 57:34)
confusing um because even my Uber driver (57:30 - 57:36)
I remember I&#39;m saying Uber not grab (57:34 - 57:38)
couldn&#39;t figure out how to get into the (57:36 - 57:42)
mall this guy lives in Jakarta and he (57:38 - 57:44)
drives Uber for a living and I was like (57:42 - 57:46)
Central Park Mall please and he was like (57:44 - 57:48)
okay and he couldn&#39;t figure out how to (57:46 - 57:51)
get into the mall he just we just drove (57:48 - 57:53)
around the mall until eventually he (57:51 - 57:55)
figured it out and then we dropped us (57:53 - 57:57)
off at the you&#39;re only allowed for cars (57:55 - 58:00)
to drop off here it was crazy (57:57 - 58:02)
but the (58:00 - 58:05)
event ended up being at what call was (58:02 - 58:07)
called the pick and they also built a (58:05 - 58:11)
new place called The pick 2 and that was (58:07 - 58:13)
the northernmost part of if you look at (58:11 - 58:18)
that event map of it so every day I had (58:13 - 58:21)
to take depending on traffic if it was (58:18 - 58:23)
before 9:00 a.m. it was only 30 minutes (58:21 - 58:26)
it was if it was anytime after 9:00 a.m. (58:23 - 58:28)
and and for the rest of the day it took (58:26 - 58:32)
an hour I had to take an Uber to that (58:28 - 58:35)
area because there was there&#39;s no public (58:32 - 58:37)
transportation in this city um I mean (58:35 - 58:39)
there is but it doesn&#39;t go (58:37 - 58:42)
anywhere uh there&#39;s no public (58:39 - 58:44)
transportation in the city and you can&#39;t (58:42 - 58:46)
walk anywhere so you either have to Uber (58:44 - 58:49)
yourself a motorcycle and I&#39;m not bold (58:46 - 58:52)
enough to get on a motorcycle and weave (58:49 - 58:55)
in and out of multi-lane (58:52 - 58:58)
traffic uh or car which is much (58:55 - 59:01)
slower granted like L literally every (58:58 - 59:03)
single Uber ride I took was like $10 (59:01 - 59:05)
just flat like almost all of them were (59:03 - 59:10)
like $10 or $5 or $6 so the (59:05 - 59:14)
pick was another Mall Jakarta Indonesia (59:10 - 59:17)
loves malls another Mall kind of small (59:14 - 59:19)
but it had the store so it had a whole (59:17 - 59:21)
merchandise store with exclusive Jakarta (59:19 - 59:24)
stuff very cool nothing like that in (59:21 - 59:27)
inchon no store at all um (59:24 - 59:30)
it had uh a TCG area where you could (59:27 - 59:33)
learn how to play the TCG they had huge (59:30 - 59:35)
like TCG cards that they had like around (59:33 - 59:37)
like Yokohama for the World (59:35 - 59:40)
Championships they had uh trapos and (59:37 - 59:42)
Pikachu meet and greet I didn&#39;t even (59:40 - 59:44)
know that trapa ghost was like a mascot (59:42 - 59:46)
figure with a person walking around yeah (59:44 - 59:48)
like trapa Ghost came out that was (59:46 - 59:50)
pretty cool uh they had the anime (59:48 - 59:51)
playing so when it wasn&#39;t a meet and (59:50 - 59:53)
greet they just had the anime playing on (59:51 - 59:54)
that (59:53 - 59:56)
screen uh they just had like a a bunch (59:54 - 59:59)
of stuff and then the the that mall the (59:56 - 60:01)
pick had a shuttle bus that would then (59:59 - 60:04)
take you to pick two (60:01 - 60:07)
so imagine it takes me an hour to get to (60:04 - 60:10)
the pick it takes another 30 minutes to (60:07 - 60:14)
get to the pick too the pick (60:10 - 60:20)
two is an outdoor area where they had an (60:14 - 60:22)
outdoor stage and the pick two which was (60:20 - 60:26)
kind of confusing opened at like 2:00 (60:22 - 60:29)
p.m. even though the event started at (60:26 - 60:31)
10: so you could like go there but there (60:29 - 60:34)
was like nothing to do but also as a (60:31 - 60:37)
Pokemon go player it was the worst place (60:34 - 60:41)
ever to play Pokemon go and if you&#39;ve it (60:37 - 60:43)
just if you&#39;ve been following my journey (60:41 - 60:45)
of uber (60:43 - 60:47)
rides if you&#39;re gonna even if you were (60:45 - 60:49)
staying at the pick if you&#39;re gonna put (60:47 - 60:53)
a half hour to get to the pick (60:49 - 60:53)
two you want to do the stuff that there (60:53 - 60:59)
but then you&#39;re like I but I want to (60:56 - 61:00)
play Pokémon go but it was like the (60:59 - 61:02)
worst place to play Pokémon go but if (61:00 - 61:04)
you&#39;re like well I want to leave to a (61:02 - 61:07)
better place to play Pokemon go that&#39;s a (61:04 - 61:10)
half hour yeah and then like but I want (61:07 - 61:12)
to go see something at the pick two so (61:10 - 61:14)
that&#39;s a half hour back so you&#39;re like (61:12 - 61:17)
in this really weird position so the (61:14 - 61:19)
pick two had a huge outdoor (61:17 - 61:22)
stage and at like (61:19 - 61:25)
2:00 was the Pikachu parade so all these (61:22 - 61:27)
Pikachus came out and they like walked (61:25 - 61:29)
across the bridge and then they they (61:27 - 61:30)
they walked to the stage and like that (61:29 - 61:32)
was really cool and then at like (61:30 - 61:35)
2:30 um was like the first performance (61:32 - 61:38)
was which was Pokemon kids it was a (61:35 - 61:40)
Pokemon kids performance so they did (61:38 - 61:44)
like the poked dance song The (61:40 - 61:44)
like it&#39;s it&#39;s like a it was like a Tik (61:44 - 61:50)
Tok Trend okay and then they did like uh (61:46 - 61:52)
if you ever went to like the Pokemon (61:50 - 61:54)
cafe they do like a song there it&#39;s like (61:52 - 61:56)
the Happy and You Know It song so they (61:54 - 61:57)
did the Happy and You Know It song they (61:56 - 62:00)
did the Pokey dance song and then after (61:57 - 62:02)
that this is where it gets (62:00 - 62:04)
cool (62:02 - 62:07)
they brought out well anytime there&#39;s a (62:04 - 62:09)
performance there&#39;s Dan dancing Pikachus (62:07 - 62:11)
to be fair that&#39;s why that started off (62:09 - 62:12)
with the Pikachu parade because the (62:11 - 62:14)
Pikachu parade had to get to the stage (62:12 - 62:16)
so then those Pikachus could (62:14 - 62:20)
perform duh duh that&#39;s how it works as (62:16 - 62:23)
it works yeah uh so after the Pokey (62:20 - 62:24)
dance of the Pikachu&#39;s performing and (62:23 - 62:29)
everything then hatsun Miku C like came (62:24 - 62:31)
out well not really came out because (62:29 - 62:33)
she&#39;s not a real person she&#39;s real to me (62:31 - 62:36)
but she like appeared on (62:33 - 62:38)
screen and then the Pikachu&#39;s came out (62:36 - 62:41)
and then they did um they did like five (62:38 - 62:44)
hatsun Miku songs and I want to (62:41 - 62:47)
apologize to everyone for not covering (62:44 - 62:50)
the hatsun Miku stuff as we didn&#39;t do a (62:47 - 62:51)
very good job at covering it because I (62:50 - 62:53)
didn&#39;t really like care about (62:51 - 62:56)
it I&#39;m a (62:53 - 62:58)
I&#39;m the biggest hatsun Miku fan in the (62:56 - 63:00)
entire world now those I didn&#39;t I&#39;ve (62:58 - 63:02)
never like really listened to those (63:00 - 63:05)
songs they&#39;re so good and when you&#39;re (63:02 - 63:08)
seeing them live with like dancers and (63:05 - 63:11)
Pikachu dancing and like human dancers (63:08 - 63:13)
and like the graphics in the background (63:11 - 63:17)
like it&#39;s like 110 degrees outside and (63:13 - 63:19)
I&#39;m watching a hatsun hatsun Miku (63:17 - 63:22)
concert in Jakarta it was like the (63:19 - 63:23)
coolest thing ever I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t (63:22 - 63:25)
think the album is out yet but I think (63:23 - 63:28)
there are 20 (63:25 - 63:31)
songs that she did so (63:28 - 63:34)
far and I think they&#39;re doing a second (63:31 - 63:38)
album jeez it it was incredible it was (63:34 - 63:42)
so good like the performance of one the (63:38 - 63:44)
dancing the music was super good and (63:42 - 63:47)
then the video to like line up with the (63:44 - 63:50)
dance and the song just like phenomenal (63:47 - 63:54)
cuz like every song was like her being a (63:50 - 63:55)
different charact like her being in team (63:54 - 63:58)
Rock gear for like the Team Rocket song (63:55 - 64:01)
the Pokemon songs these weren&#39;t just (63:58 - 64:05)
random songs okay she performed the the (64:01 - 64:08)
five of her 20 Pokemon songs okay and (64:05 - 64:11)
they are good all of the I have been (64:08 - 64:13)
listening to the music videos and all of (64:11 - 64:15)
that they&#39;re really good music so good (64:13 - 64:17)
and like even if you&#39;ve never listened (64:15 - 64:20)
to hatsu Miku I am telling you to check (64:17 - 64:23)
this stuff out because it is like she&#39;s (64:20 - 64:27)
mixing the like Game Boy sounds or like (64:23 - 64:30)
the red and blue like clicks she&#39;s like (64:27 - 64:33)
probably played the most nostalgic ones (64:30 - 64:36)
they oh yeah I&#39;m be fair whatever they (64:33 - 64:39)
played so when so there was (64:36 - 64:42)
like kind of no one there and then like (64:39 - 64:45)
10 minutes before hatsu Miku came on (64:42 - 64:47)
just all of these fans showed up and it (64:45 - 64:49)
was very obvious they were hatsu Miku (64:47 - 64:51)
fans because they were carrying hatsun (64:49 - 64:53)
Miku plushes they just showed up out of (64:51 - 64:56)
nowhere and every time that she started (64:53 - 64:59)
a new song they would lose their minds (64:56 - 65:02)
they were so excited and that like (64:59 - 65:05)
that&#39;s like infectious right like like (65:02 - 65:06)
they were like I cannot believe she&#39;s (65:05 - 65:08)
playing this song and it was like I (65:06 - 65:10)
don&#39;t know what song this is but it was (65:08 - 65:13)
so (65:10 - 65:13)
good anyways those songs are incredible (65:15 - 65:21)
and you should check them out um they (65:19 - 65:23)
are they are (65:21 - 65:27)
so Pokemon infused that you will (65:23 - 65:30)
definitely like understand it is so much (65:27 - 65:33)
better than the Pokemon 25 (65:30 - 65:33)
soundtrack that wasn&#39;t even really (65:34 - 65:39)
Pokemon the hatsun mik Miku songs (65:37 - 65:41)
absolutely are they are there are (65:39 - 65:45)
definitely I think a wide range of songs (65:41 - 65:46)
because they&#39;ve released a lot of them (65:45 - 65:48)
at this point but some of them really (65:46 - 65:49)
tugg at the heartstrings and some of (65:48 - 65:52)
them are just really (65:49 - 65:55)
cool yeah some of the music videos even (65:52 - 65:58)
have English sub titles so not all (65:55 - 66:00)
of I promise you that I&#39;m telling you (65:58 - 66:02)
all this for this to make sense at the (66:00 - 66:05)
end so then after hold on I want to like (66:02 - 66:07)
hold on sorry I want to back up a little (66:05 - 66:10)
bit because this all started off with (66:07 - 66:14)
like City Safari yes Pokemon go City (66:10 - 66:17)
Safari but like we&#39;ve we&#39;re not we&#39;re (66:14 - 66:19)
not talking City Safari anymore we&#39;re (66:17 - 66:21)
talking Pikachu parades and we&#39;re (66:19 - 66:23)
talking concerts and things we are we (66:21 - 66:27)
are we&#39;ve left Pokémon go (66:23 - 66:29)
and are somewhere else completely and I (66:27 - 66:31)
understand that there&#39;s it was a (66:29 - 66:33)
collaboration because it was at the same (66:31 - 66:36)
time as this Pikachu and Jakarta event (66:33 - 66:38)
Pikachu Indonesian journey is what it&#39;s (66:36 - 66:41)
called right yes so okay I&#39;m just making (66:38 - 66:43)
sure we&#39;re all clear on like what&#39;s (66:41 - 66:45)
going on here like this is not Pokemon (66:43 - 66:47)
go related completely so this is the (66:45 - 66:51)
weirdest part about this event is I I I (66:47 - 66:53)
will admit I was wrong I thought this (66:51 - 66:55)
was like a Niantic Pokemon go thing and (66:53 - 66:57)
like part of that is because like who (66:55 - 66:59)
paid for my trip it wasn&#39;t the Pokemon (66:57 - 67:00)
company right like sometimes the Pokemon (66:59 - 67:03)
company pays for stuff right like I just (67:00 - 67:06)
went out to that TCG preview thing in (67:03 - 67:08)
New York that was paid for by the (67:06 - 67:13)
Pokemon company um and Niantic paid for (67:08 - 67:15)
this so in my mind that I&#39;m going to (67:13 - 67:19)
Jakarta to play Pokemon go and to cover (67:15 - 67:22)
Pokemon go and (67:19 - 67:26)
MH I think the biggest disservice is is (67:22 - 67:29)
that that to an American audience or (67:26 - 67:32)
maybe like not an Indonesian uh audience (67:29 - 67:34)
they advertised this at least in the (67:32 - 67:37)
west as like a Pokemon go event right (67:34 - 67:40)
like everything we saw about this was (67:37 - 67:43)
from Niantic or from the Pokemon go team (67:40 - 67:46)
of like come to Jakarta play Pokémon go (67:43 - 67:48)
it&#39;s a city Safari we&#39;ve had City (67:46 - 67:51)
safaris in Soul and and Mexico City and (67:48 - 67:54)
St Louis and uh it&#39;s an EV right yeah (67:51 - 67:55)
it&#39;s an event on their website on (67:54 - 67:56)
Pokemon go live like it&#39;s the city (67:55 - 67:59)
Safari you pay for the ticket through (67:56 - 68:01)
Pokemon go live like and and and that (67:59 - 68:03)
that event did (68:01 - 68:06)
exist and there were definitely there (68:03 - 68:08)
were definitely stops and like I had (68:06 - 68:11)
like lunch and everything with Niantic (68:08 - 68:15)
but like that was that was such a small (68:11 - 68:18)
part of like this entire event whereas (68:15 - 68:21)
like I didn&#39;t know hatsun Miku was (68:18 - 68:23)
performing I didn&#39;t know DJ Pikachu was (68:21 - 68:25)
performing I didn&#39;t know there was a (68:23 - 68:27)
drone show I didn&#39;t know there was going (68:25 - 68:28)
to be two different merch stores one at (68:27 - 68:31)
pick and one at pick two I didn&#39;t know (68:28 - 68:33)
there was a Pikachu parade I didn&#39;t I (68:31 - 68:35)
knew there was a Pokemon run thing but (68:33 - 68:37)
like that sold out months ago so in my (68:35 - 68:39)
head I was like I I guess I&#39;m not going (68:37 - 68:40)
to do the Pokemon run because it already (68:39 - 68:44)
sold out like there were just so like it (68:40 - 68:49)
was a Pokemon event and it&#39;s like it&#39;s (68:44 - 68:52)
crazy to me that like in the (68:49 - 68:54)
west they were just like yeah it&#39;s a (68:52 - 68:56)
Pokemon go event yeah cuz usually (68:54 - 68:59)
Pokémon go events are just Pokémon go (68:56 - 69:02)
events or there is a Pokemon event like (68:59 - 69:05)
worlds that has all of this stuff but (69:02 - 69:07)
it&#39;s worlds so the Pokemon go event is (69:05 - 69:09)
not the featured part and it&#39;s not a (69:07 - 69:11)
ticketed Pokemon go event or anything (69:09 - 69:14)
like that this is some weird combination (69:11 - 69:17)
of the two yeah yeah and it&#39;s funny (69:14 - 69:19)
because unfortunately like it&#39;s a weird (69:17 - 69:20)
time zone thing so like not as many (69:19 - 69:22)
people who normally watch me are able to (69:20 - 69:23)
watch me because I&#39;m literally streaming (69:22 - 69:26)
at like 4:00 a.m. most people&#39;s time but (69:23 - 69:28)
everyone watching was like why isn&#39;t (69:26 - 69:30)
Pokemon go events like this like why (69:28 - 69:32)
like like like go Fest or something like (69:30 - 69:34)
why isn&#39;t there a concert where we could (69:32 - 69:36)
stop playing for an hour and watch if we (69:34 - 69:38)
wanted to why isn&#39;t there like a run (69:36 - 69:41)
there was a whole 5K and it&#39;s not the (69:38 - 69:42)
first time they&#39;ve done this because (69:41 - 69:44)
like Pikachu&#39;s Indonesian Journey has (69:42 - 69:45)
been going on and off for like the last (69:44 - 69:47)
couple years like they had they&#39;ve had (69:45 - 69:49)
an event in Bali and they&#39;ve done (69:47 - 69:50)
because like in Indonesia is like an (69:49 - 69:52)
emerging market so they&#39;re really trying (69:50 - 69:55)
to push that but when when you say like (69:52 - 69:56)
they&#39;re really trying to (69:55 - 69:59)
push an increase of (69:56 - 70:02)
like ultimately money to this country (69:59 - 70:05)
that involves tourism so why would you (70:02 - 70:07)
advertise it that way right like you (70:05 - 70:09)
could maybe have somebody who&#39;s very (70:07 - 70:12)
casual in Pokemon go and be like ah I (70:09 - 70:14)
like Pokemon go but not enough to fly to (70:12 - 70:15)
a different country but if you if if I (70:14 - 70:17)
was like hey it&#39;s not Al it&#39;s not (70:15 - 70:19)
Pokemon go it&#39;s like a whole exclusive (70:17 - 70:22)
merch store it is a like a whole 5K that (70:19 - 70:24)
you can run it is multiple concerts that (70:22 - 70:26)
are completely free like you don&#39;t have (70:24 - 70:28)
to pay you didn&#39;t have to pay to get (70:26 - 70:32)
into see DJ Pikachu or the Drone show or (70:28 - 70:34)
the Pikachu parade I mean you had to (70:32 - 70:37)
commit like 30 minutes in an Uber to get (70:34 - 70:38)
there but (70:37 - 70:41)
like yeah I mean as a as a Pokemon go (70:38 - 70:43)
player as someone who wasn&#39;t there or (70:41 - 70:45)
planning to go there I would see the (70:43 - 70:46)
event and think oh I know what Pokemon (70:45 - 70:49)
go events are generally like okay that&#39;s (70:46 - 70:53)
fine but this is so much more than that (70:49 - 70:56)
yeah it was yeah (70:53 - 70:57)
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m just looking because I was (70:56 - 70:59)
just I just Googled real quick like (70:57 - 71:02)
Pikachu&#39;s Indonesia J journey to see (70:59 - 71:04)
like what where this would even come up (71:02 - 71:08)
and I will say props to the team that (71:04 - 71:12)
got flying pikachu. comom as a as a (71:08 - 71:16)
domain because flying pikachu. comom (71:12 - 71:17)
takes you basically to Pikachu&#39;s (71:16 - 71:20)
Indonesia journey and it&#39;s this whole (71:17 - 71:24)
thing but it&#39;s not in English so I mean (71:20 - 71:26)
you can translate it to English but it&#39;s (71:24 - 71:27)
just it&#39;s just weird that there&#39;s no (71:26 - 71:30)
connection to that even on like Pokémon (71:27 - 71:33)
Go&#39;s website in any way to say like hey (71:30 - 71:35)
other than the little logo that says (71:33 - 71:36)
like this is a collaboration between (71:35 - 71:37)
these two (71:36 - 71:39)
things that&#39;s so weird to me like there (71:37 - 71:41)
there&#39;s so much to advertise here so (71:39 - 71:45)
much marketing to do here yeah I I I I (71:41 - 71:46)
obviously there&#39;s different teams right (71:45 - 71:47)
there&#39;s different Niantic teams like (71:46 - 71:49)
there&#39;s a Niantic person in charge of (71:47 - 71:50)
Mexico there&#39;s Niantic person in charge (71:49 - 71:53)
of the US right so there same thing for (71:50 - 71:56)
Pokemon like the the people in charge of (71:53 - 71:57)
Pokemon events in Japan are not the same (71:56 - 71:58)
people who are in charge of Pokemon (71:57 - 72:00)
events in the US not the same people who (71:58 - 72:03)
like the person I work with in Pokemon (72:00 - 72:05)
doesn&#39;t work with like Joe caby right (72:03 - 72:09)
because the UK Europe has their own (72:05 - 72:14)
Pokemon yeah manager right um I do wish (72:09 - 72:16)
there was like a little bit better (72:14 - 72:18)
advertising because even as somebody who (72:16 - 72:20)
covers Pokemon news for a living I was (72:18 - 72:23)
like I didn&#39;t know that there would be (72:20 - 72:25)
like multiple concerts that were (72:23 - 72:27)
completely free I just didn&#39;t know they (72:25 - 72:30)
were so cool so then after hatsu Miku DJ (72:27 - 72:32)
Pikachu came on and it says like EDM (72:30 - 72:35)
show I&#39;ve never been to an like I know (72:32 - 72:37)
what an EDM show is I&#39;ve never but like (72:35 - 72:40)
I&#39;ve never been to an EDM show and to (72:37 - 72:42)
have (72:40 - 72:45)
like 20 Pikachus on stage one of them (72:42 - 72:47)
wearing sunglasses to signify that he is (72:45 - 72:51)
the DJ and then having like lights and (72:47 - 72:54)
and and smoke and like actual like EDM (72:51 - 73:00)
Pokemon music happening was just so (72:54 - 73:03)
cool that&#39;s incredible all of this is (73:00 - 73:06)
incredible it is it really is yeah I I (73:03 - 73:09)
if you wanted to see it like I I I (73:06 - 73:11)
streamed the whole thing so I like I (73:09 - 73:13)
just put my camera on my little tripod (73:11 - 73:15)
and I just held it above everyone&#39;s head (73:13 - 73:17)
so twitch chat had like a way better (73:15 - 73:20)
view than I did but like you can see how (73:17 - 73:22)
cool it is I&#39;ll probably eventually move (73:20 - 73:23)
those to (73:22 - 73:26)
YouTube but it was just like a like it (73:23 - 73:29)
was an amazing and incredible and just (73:26 - 73:34)
fantastic Pokemon event it was a bad go (73:29 - 73:36)
event which is funny I&#39;m saying that (73:34 - 73:37)
because people are like you always say (73:36 - 73:38)
the go events are good because Niantic (73:37 - 73:41)
pace for you it was a bad go event like (73:38 - 73:44)
and I think I think like Niantic tried I (73:41 - 73:46)
don&#39;t think like they purposely made it (73:44 - 73:50)
bad I think that it&#39;s just hard like (73:46 - 73:52)
when I say like that that pick two area (73:50 - 73:54)
where all the DJ stuff is and the Drone (73:52 - 73:57)
show is there&#39;s just nothing out there (73:54 - 73:59)
it&#39;s just kind of a big field and they (73:57 - 74:00)
decorated it like really nice not (73:59 - 74:02)
Niantic but the Pokemon Indonesia (74:00 - 74:04)
decorated it super nicely there was like (74:02 - 74:07)
Viv hanging R Island in New York was (74:04 - 74:09)
also just a big field yeah that yeah (74:07 - 74:14)
yeah well but like there was like three (74:09 - 74:18)
gyms there and maybe like 10 Poké stops (74:14 - 74:19)
and they were all Ed up and everything (74:18 - 74:22)
but it was it was in it was in an H like (74:19 - 74:25)
it was like two long strips and then in (74:22 - 74:27)
the center was just the bridge so there (74:25 - 74:30)
wasn&#39;t a good Loop you could do so you (74:27 - 74:31)
could like catch everything and then (74:30 - 74:33)
just kind of wait for things to respawn (74:31 - 74:36)
because you&#39;re it&#39;s not big enough to go (74:33 - 74:38)
far enough away and then you&#39;re like (74:36 - 74:40)
well just go somewhere else there&#39;s (74:38 - 74:43)
nothing around the pick two we like me (74:40 - 74:45)
and I was with Zoe two dos and we had to (74:43 - 74:49)
walk 10 minutes over a bridge against (74:45 - 74:50)
eight Lanes of (74:49 - 74:55)
traffic to then get to another Mall area (74:50 - 74:57)
which is like a brand new mall area (74:55 - 75:00)
which only had one gym and like five (74:57 - 75:02)
Poké stops cuz it was literally just (75:00 - 75:05)
developed and because Pokemon go is (75:02 - 75:06)
based off cell phone (75:05 - 75:09)
traffic people aren&#39;t going there enough (75:06 - 75:12)
to then make more Pokemon generate so it (75:09 - 75:14)
was like okay we we can leave this area (75:12 - 75:17)
and go get lunch but there&#39;s nothing to (75:14 - 75:19)
do over here and then come back well (75:17 - 75:21)
that&#39;s on construction workers for not (75:19 - 75:24)
playing on the job playing pokon on the (75:21 - 75:27)
job it&#39;s weird cuz like that area had so (75:24 - 75:30)
many photo opportunities was super (75:27 - 75:33)
decorated was so nice it had the stages (75:30 - 75:35)
and like there was really only 20 (75:33 - 75:37)
minutes of downtime between performances (75:35 - 75:40)
so you didn&#39;t want to (75:37 - 75:44)
leave but you also wanted to play go but (75:40 - 75:47)
it was a bad place to play (75:44 - 75:47)
go it was I I I know from talking to (75:47 - 75:53)
people that the other areas were not (75:51 - 75:55)
decorated right so on the map (75:53 - 75:57)
M that Niantic setup it was like here (75:55 - 75:59)
are like eight different places you can (75:57 - 76:00)
play and one of them is the pick and the (75:59 - 76:02)
pick two right and those are the only (76:00 - 76:04)
two areas decorated both the pick and (76:02 - 76:06)
the pick two had stores that you could (76:04 - 76:07)
buy stuff it was the same stuff at (76:06 - 76:09)
either store um but if you wanted to go (76:07 - 76:11)
to like Oldtown or you wanted to go to (76:09 - 76:13)
like Grand Central (76:11 - 76:16)
Mall there were definitely players there (76:13 - 76:18)
there were definitely everything was (76:16 - 76:19)
lured up there was definitely stops (76:18 - 76:20)
there were the Eevee stops there were (76:19 - 76:23)
plenty of spawns but it wasn&#39;t (76:20 - 76:26)
decorated like (76:23 - 76:29)
anything else because it was a city (76:26 - 76:33)
experience so so just to clarify um this (76:29 - 76:36)
was the first time that Niantic had done (76:33 - 76:39)
an event a Pokemon go event in Indonesia (76:36 - 76:44)
correct no they they have done they did (76:39 - 76:46)
a a different Jakarta one and I think (76:44 - 76:50)
they did two Bali ones but it was always (76:46 - 76:54)
with Pikachu&#39;s Indonesia Journey oh so (76:50 - 76:56)
this the first time that they&#39;ve done it (76:54 - 76:58)
collaborating with Pikachu&#39;s Indonesia (76:56 - 77:00)
Journey right which is why I&#39;m saying (76:58 - 77:03)
the confusing part is in the west it&#39;s (77:00 - 77:06)
just always advertised as Pokemon go but (77:03 - 77:10)
it&#39;s so much more than that really (77:06 - 77:14)
curious if all of these have been yeah I (77:10 - 77:16)
was gonna say like I I was going to give (77:14 - 77:19)
the benefit of the doubt to okay Niantic (77:16 - 77:21)
is pushing into this other thing that&#39;s (77:19 - 77:25)
already happening and their event just (77:21 - 77:27)
is is n as big as the other event right (77:25 - 77:29)
so they&#39;re just putting this smaller (77:27 - 77:31)
event within this bigger event giving (77:29 - 77:33)
the benefit of the doubt to tried it for (77:31 - 77:36)
the first time and that&#39;s how it worked (77:33 - 77:39)
but this isn&#39;t the first time it&#39;s like (77:36 - 77:41)
there&#39;s multiple chances here I don&#39;t (77:39 - 77:44)
think it&#39;s like specifically niantic&#39;s (77:41 - 77:48)
fault because of how Jakarta is built (77:44 - 77:50)
like right like Pokemon go is pretty (77:48 - 77:51)
unfair we always talk about this like (77:50 - 77:53)
right like if you live in like Green Bay (77:51 - 77:55)
Wisconsin you&#39;re going to have a very (77:53 - 77:56)
different experience than somebody (77:55 - 77:59)
living in San Diego California like you (77:56 - 78:01)
it&#39;s the same game it&#39;s the same country (77:59 - 78:02)
but you&#39;re just going to have very (78:01 - 78:04)
different experiences like if I go to (78:02 - 78:08)
Japan my Pokemon go experience is just (78:04 - 78:11)
infinitely times better because Japan is (78:08 - 78:13)
so on top of each other so can there&#39;s (78:11 - 78:14)
so many people so many stops so many (78:13 - 78:19)
cell phones Jakarta is so there&#39;s a lot (78:14 - 78:20)
of people in Jakarta right there&#39;s a lot (78:19 - 78:24)
of people in Indonesia but if you if you (78:20 - 78:26)
just want to like see it as like I want (78:24 - 78:29)
to see the city yeah and I want to play (78:26 - 78:31)
Pokemon go and different things you&#39;re (78:29 - 78:34)
just like so gridlocked by traffic and (78:31 - 78:36)
no public transportation that you&#39;re (78:34 - 78:38)
like this not niantic&#39;s fault but it is (78:36 - 78:41)
a city experience and I can&#39;t really see (78:38 - 78:44)
the city because I so hard to like do I (78:41 - 78:46)
want to spend 30 minutes to go here (78:44 - 78:48)
where I&#39;ve never been I don&#39;t know if (78:46 - 78:50)
it&#39;s actually going to be as good on (78:48 - 78:55)
paper to play versus where I am sure but (78:50 - 78:58)
Niantic is in control of the Poké stops (78:55 - 78:59)
they&#39;re in control of the gyms they&#39;re (78:58 - 79:01)
in control of adding all of that they (78:59 - 79:03)
can add the spawns they can add they can (79:01 - 79:05)
decorate things they can they can add (79:03 - 79:08)
things to the places that they&#39;re saying (79:05 - 79:10)
hey play here just cuz the new mall (79:08 - 79:12)
isn&#39;t developed or just got developed (79:10 - 79:14)
and so there&#39;s like no stop they can add (79:12 - 79:16)
things in there for events so they can (79:14 - 79:18)
say like we&#39;re giving you this city (79:16 - 79:21)
experience in Jakarta they can add a (79:18 - 79:24)
bunch of stuff there to make it really (79:21 - 79:26)
Lively and playable and they can (79:24 - 79:28)
decorate the areas that they know people (79:26 - 79:31)
are going to be playing in just like the (79:28 - 79:32)
Pokemon company is decorating these (79:31 - 79:36)
areas for Pikachu&#39;s Indonesia Journey (79:32 - 79:38)
they can Niantic can also do that to (79:36 - 79:40)
make that experience its own thing as (79:38 - 79:42)
well that you know they&#39;re not they&#39;re (79:40 - 79:44)
not constricted by when you play in San (79:42 - 79:47)
Diego and you play in Green Bay Niantic (79:44 - 79:50)
isn&#39;t adding anything extra there (79:47 - 79:52)
because it&#39;s just an average Tuesday in (79:50 - 79:54)
San Diego or Green Bay but when there is (79:52 - 79:57)
an event in Jakarta they can do whatever (79:54 - 80:00)
they want to make that event as (79:57 - 80:02)
populated or not populated as they want (80:00 - 80:04)
it to be I know what they can or cannot (80:02 - 80:07)
do but we&#39;ve watched them add stops and (80:04 - 80:09)
add they all the Eevee stops that add (80:07 - 80:11)
they add all those I did watch them add (80:09 - 80:14)
more gyms and stops to Madrid after the (80:11 - 80:16)
first day of seeing people complain that (80:14 - 80:18)
there was not enough in that happen (80:16 - 80:21)
Madrid Y and they can and if they plan (80:18 - 80:23)
these things out and have had multiple (80:21 - 80:25)
times of doing these events in this (80:23 - 80:29)
place I feel like they could have an (80:25 - 80:30)
idea (80:29 - 80:34)
of what to put in different places or I (80:30 - 80:37)
do wonder if the reason so the the pick (80:34 - 80:40)
one the pick is a mall and it&#39;s like (80:37 - 80:43)
four floors and that&#39;s where the TCG (80:40 - 80:46)
stuff was the anime stuff was the the (80:43 - 80:49)
store was the photo opportunities that (80:46 - 80:52)
mall was so small though that you would (80:49 - 80:55)
do a lap of that mall and it does (80:52 - 80:56)
doesn&#39;t matter what floor you&#39;re on cuz (80:55 - 80:58)
that&#39;s not how poke Pokemon doesn&#39;t (80:56 - 80:59)
scale (80:58 - 81:02)
upwards but if you did a whole lap it (80:59 - 81:05)
would not be enough time for things to (81:02 - 81:08)
respawn right like just using Mall of (81:05 - 81:10)
America for an example if I walk around (81:08 - 81:12)
all of Mall of America by the time I get (81:10 - 81:14)
back to where I started it&#39;s been long (81:12 - 81:16)
enough where everything is going to be (81:14 - 81:18)
new again it&#39;s like eight miles wide or (81:16 - 81:21)
something Mall of America right but like (81:18 - 81:23)
if you go I get it I get it like if you (81:21 - 81:26)
if if I went to Central Park in inchon (81:23 - 81:29)
and I walked that Circle it would be (81:26 - 81:31)
different by the time I&#39;m done and I (81:29 - 81:33)
think that&#39;s like where most pokemon go (81:31 - 81:35)
players are looking I&#39;m looking for a (81:33 - 81:38)
loop or I&#39;m looking for something so the (81:35 - 81:40)
pick there&#39;s just no way to do that (81:38 - 81:43)
because once you get there there&#39;s (81:40 - 81:45)
nothing outside the pick that you can (81:43 - 81:49)
walk to there&#39;s just 20 lanes of traffic (81:45 - 81:53)
in front of the pick right that like (81:49 - 81:55)
there&#39;s not even there&#39;s not even on the (81:53 - 81:57)
ground there&#39;s just (81:55 - 82:01)
cars everywhere I mean I I get it I get (81:57 - 82:05)
that it&#39;s constricted by the way the (82:01 - 82:08)
city is but they&#39;re going into the City (82:05 - 82:11)
and making an event so like they can (82:08 - 82:15)
still do things to make the event more (82:11 - 82:17)
event likee like even though the game (82:15 - 82:19)
has these things where you have to have (82:17 - 82:22)
spawn times of I mean some Pokemon spawn (82:19 - 82:24)
every 15 minutes some spawn for 25 some (82:22 - 82:26)
spawn for 4 remember back in the day we (82:24 - 82:28)
had there&#39;s different spawn times for (82:26 - 82:30)
Pokemon that spawn not everything is (82:28 - 82:32)
exactly the same they can add those (82:30 - 82:33)
things they can change those things for (82:32 - 82:37)
an event for a few days when they know (82:33 - 82:38)
they&#39;re doing this especially when the (82:37 - 82:40)
leadup to it is months in advance it&#39;s (82:38 - 82:42)
not like they knew three weeks ago they (82:40 - 82:44)
were going to do an event in Jakarta so (82:42 - 82:47)
they can change these things to make (82:44 - 82:50)
more if for the pick and specifically (82:47 - 82:53)
the pick two where all the performances (82:50 - 82:57)
were if they didn&#39;t want to make it that (82:53 - 83:00)
good of a place to play because there (82:57 - 83:03)
were other things to do like we don&#39;t (83:00 - 83:06)
want all our Pokemon go players to come (83:03 - 83:08)
out to pick (83:06 - 83:12)
two because this is a free event so like (83:08 - 83:14)
you just had to go through security to (83:12 - 83:16)
get in to see these (83:14 - 83:19)
concerts um so I do wonder if part of (83:16 - 83:21)
that is cuz if I when I went to Central (83:19 - 83:23)
Park Mall not to be confused with (83:21 - 83:25)
Central Park Park in in when I went to (83:23 - 83:29)
Central Park Mall in Jakarta there were (83:25 - 83:31)
tons of Pokémon go players it was very (83:29 - 83:33)
obvious they were playing there the (83:31 - 83:35)
reason I didn&#39;t play there that long is (83:33 - 83:36)
because I didn&#39;t really have good (83:35 - 83:39)
reception there and I did meet a bunch (83:36 - 83:41)
of like Indonesian people and they were (83:39 - 83:42)
like yeah my reception kind of sucks (83:41 - 83:44)
today and I was like well gez if you (83:42 - 83:47)
live here and your re reception sucks (83:44 - 83:49)
like that&#39;s not a good sign for me with (83:47 - 83:52)
a eim but it (83:49 - 83:55)
was it was nice cuz it was air (83:52 - 83:56)
conditioning and it&#39;s very hot in (83:55 - 83:59)
Jakarta but even when I like left that (83:56 - 84:01)
mall I actually got yelled at by a (83:59 - 84:03)
security guard cuz I was like trying to (84:01 - 84:05)
get to an Eevee stop and I was like oh (84:03 - 84:07)
okay we we have to go out here there&#39;s (84:05 - 84:08)
like this bridge it looks like it (84:07 - 84:11)
connects to another part of the mall I (84:08 - 84:13)
think it was another part of the mall (84:11 - 84:15)
but there was also apartments above it (84:13 - 84:17)
but he was like oh No cameras No cameras (84:15 - 84:19)
so he wouldn&#39;t let me cross the bridge (84:17 - 84:20)
and I couldn&#39;t get to the E which is (84:19 - 84:24)
like fine like totally cool um like and (84:20 - 84:27)
anytime I&#39;m on somebody else&#39;s property (84:24 - 84:29)
mall or whatever not public property I (84:27 - 84:32)
should say if you got to do what it&#39;s (84:29 - 84:34)
private property right they they they (84:32 - 84:36)
can tell you what to do so I couldn&#39;t so (84:34 - 84:38)
I was like okay that&#39;s fine I can&#39;t (84:36 - 84:39)
cross this bridge to get to this Eevee (84:38 - 84:43)
stop um and again going back to my (84:39 - 84:45)
earlier conversation I couldn&#39;t figure (84:43 - 84:48)
out how to leave this mall to then walk (84:45 - 84:50)
to the eveve there&#39;s just no sidewalks (84:48 - 84:53)
anywhere like I got out there and then I (84:50 - 84:54)
then I started panicking because like (84:53 - 84:55)
there were couple Indonesian people in (84:54 - 84:57)
my chat and they were like you&#39;re really (84:55 - 85:00)
close to other apartments and I was like (84:57 - 85:02)
and they were like somebody might come (85:00 - 85:04)
up to you and yell at you because in (85:02 - 85:07)
they they said in Indonesia they no (85:04 - 85:10)
camcs no no any filming near apartments (85:07 - 85:13)
are really like a human camera yeah I&#39;m (85:10 - 85:15)
literally walking with multiple cameras (85:13 - 85:16)
on (85:15 - 85:18)
me which again makes sense because (85:16 - 85:20)
there&#39;s a lot of Security checks in in (85:18 - 85:22)
yeah in Indonesia so now I&#39;m (85:20 - 85:25)
like like this is an apartment (85:22 - 85:27)
Courtyard I don&#39;t know if I should like (85:25 - 85:29)
go through here but also I don&#39;t even (85:27 - 85:31)
know if there&#39;s a dead end at the end (85:29 - 85:33)
because I&#39;ve been like there were many (85:31 - 85:34)
situations where I would just like start (85:33 - 85:36)
walking it would just be a dead end like (85:34 - 85:41)
yeah no sidewalk all road or just like (85:36 - 85:43)
so like I kind of explored all of Grand (85:41 - 85:45)
Central Mall (85:43 - 85:49)
and I I ended up just like I just want (85:45 - 85:50)
to go back to the pick or I just want to (85:49 - 85:52)
go back to the pick two because one it&#39;s (85:50 - 85:54)
like the pick was air conditioning the (85:52 - 85:56)
pick two was not but like I had such a (85:54 - 85:58)
good time at like the concerts and I was (85:56 - 86:01)
like it&#39;s a good enough Pokémon go (85:58 - 86:03)
experience like I am catching Pokemon I (86:01 - 86:05)
am getting shinies there are Latios (86:03 - 86:08)
latas raids it&#39;s just not (86:05 - 86:12)
like a hardcore Pokemon go experience (86:08 - 86:15)
sure and I think that&#39;s okay so I I know (86:12 - 86:17)
I know I did say like the event was bad (86:15 - 86:20)
I I I do think that if you only came to (86:17 - 86:23)
Jakarta only for Pokemon go I don&#39;t (86:20 - 86:25)
think it would have been a the same (86:23 - 86:30)
experience as a a hoen tour a c tour a (86:25 - 86:33)
go Fest Madrid go Fest New York it&#39;s not (86:30 - 86:36)
the same experience um and I think part (86:33 - 86:38)
of that is just (86:36 - 86:40)
because there were other Pokemon things (86:38 - 86:42)
to do and I&#39;m I do think there was (86:40 - 86:44)
probably a balance of like the pick two (86:42 - 86:46)
and Pokemon go at the same time of like (86:44 - 86:47)
we don&#39;t want all our players to come (86:46 - 86:49)
here please play other places but also (86:47 - 86:51)
Jakarta just (86:49 - 86:54)
being a not walkable city which again I (86:51 - 86:57)
do think it&#39;s niantic&#39;s fault to be like (86:54 - 87:00)
here&#39;s a city but but when I was talking (86:57 - 87:03)
to people who lived in IND in Jakarta (87:00 - 87:05)
they were like we don&#39;t have Parks like (87:03 - 87:09)
even if Niantic wanted to do like a park (87:05 - 87:11)
experience we we don&#39;t have Parks here (87:09 - 87:12)
we have (87:11 - 87:15)
malls and that&#39;s what they said to us (87:12 - 87:16)
like they were (87:15 - 87:18)
like instead you know is there a famous (87:16 - 87:20)
Mall in the Pokémon World they could (87:18 - 87:23)
have done the very first like Mall (87:20 - 87:25)
experience and named it after some wall (87:23 - 87:28)
and done it that way instead but it it (87:25 - 87:31)
would be weird if there was no go (87:28 - 87:33)
experience just like I think it&#39;s weird (87:31 - 87:35)
if like a World&#39;s didn&#39;t have a go (87:33 - 87:38)
experience but the world&#39;s go experience (87:35 - 87:42)
is so not go focused it&#39;s there if (87:38 - 87:45)
you&#39;re there and that&#39;s fine and it&#39;s (87:42 - 87:46)
that&#39;s great and and it&#39;s also (87:45 - 87:48)
everywhere like there there&#39;s very few (87:46 - 87:50)
things that are specific to local when (87:48 - 87:52)
you&#39;re at Worlds yeah in terms of (87:50 - 87:54)
Pokémon go and not even worlds but like (87:52 - 87:56)
are there have been events in the past (87:54 - 87:58)
where there has been an event and then (87:56 - 88:02)
there&#39;s a go aspect to it but it isn&#39;t (87:58 - 88:04)
focused on in the way that they focused (88:02 - 88:08)
on this one at least here with Pokemon (88:04 - 88:09)
go live having all the event information (88:08 - 88:11)
and going through there to buy the (88:09 - 88:12)
tickets and doing all of that like it (88:11 - 88:15)
was very much marketed as this is a go (88:12 - 88:17)
event and hey it&#39;s alongside this other (88:15 - 88:19)
event that&#39;s going on where in reality (88:17 - 88:22)
it was this is this event that&#39;s going (88:19 - 88:24)
this Pokemon event that&#39;s going on and (88:22 - 88:27)
there is a go aspect to it seems more (88:24 - 88:30)
what it was but I okay so I think (88:27 - 88:32)
overall I had a great time a fantastic (88:30 - 88:35)
time honestly uh I think I I was able to (88:32 - 88:38)
do the 5K n Niantic did get me into the (88:35 - 88:41)
5K and I did run a 5k mostly walked it (88:38 - 88:44)
but I I I would never shame like anyone (88:41 - 88:46)
who completes a 5k I would never shame (88:44 - 88:47)
anyone for walking like it&#39;s a huge (88:46 - 88:49)
accomplishment I also it was like a (88:47 - 88:51)
million degrees and I was trying to do (88:49 - 88:54)
it with a giant backpack on but I I had (88:51 - 88:56)
such a fantastic (88:54 - 89:00)
time doing a physical (88:56 - 89:04)
workout it was early too right yeah um (89:00 - 89:06)
it started at 6:00 am so I I woke up at (89:04 - 89:10)
400 a because I I had to plan my wild my (89:06 - 89:13)
45 well you wanted to get it before the (89:10 - 89:14)
heat came out right before the sun (89:13 - 89:18)
actually okay that makes sense um I had (89:14 - 89:20)
a fantastic time with the 5K fantastic (89:18 - 89:22)
time with the show I I genuinely like (89:20 - 89:25)
don&#39;t regret the experience (89:22 - 89:30)
um and I do I would like to see more of (89:25 - 89:33)
this from the Pokemon company of like (89:30 - 89:37)
instead of just going to New York to (89:33 - 89:41)
play Pokemon go for three days um (89:37 - 89:43)
which hardcore people would love to do (89:41 - 89:44)
that right they want to put their head (89:43 - 89:47)
down they want to get as many shinies as (89:44 - 89:49)
possible I&#39;m just not there in life (89:47 - 89:51)
anymore (89:49 - 89:54)
like I I like I love Pokémon go I love (89:51 - 89:56)
going to these events I I don&#39;t need to (89:54 - 90:00)
like grind out 8 hours straight for 3 (89:56 - 90:05)
days in a row um but I do think there is (90:00 - 90:10)
value or possibly a future where us or (90:05 - 90:13)
european or I think kind of already (90:10 - 90:15)
happens in Japan but these events are (90:13 - 90:18)
just more than Pokemon go it would be (90:15 - 90:20)
nice to be like oh there&#39;s going to be a (90:18 - 90:22)
drone show tonight or there&#39;s going to (90:20 - 90:25)
be a concert on Saturday so I can take (90:22 - 90:27)
an hour break from Pokemon go to see (90:25 - 90:28)
this (90:27 - 90:32)
concert um because if we can just (90:28 - 90:34)
compare directly to like Randall&#39;s (90:32 - 90:38)
Island also a hassle to get to also very (90:34 - 90:42)
hot uhhuh when you get there you&#39;re kind (90:38 - 90:43)
of (90:42 - 90:46)
like I&#39;m not leaving cuz it&#39;s such a (90:43 - 90:48)
hassle to get here so I I&#39;m going I&#39;m (90:46 - 90:51)
going to play and then the next day I&#39;m (90:48 - 90:53)
not going back because it was such a (90:51 - 90:55)
hassle to get there that&#39;s kind of how I (90:53 - 90:57)
felt here in Jakarta it&#39;s just like I I (90:55 - 91:00)
don&#39;t know if I should go there it might (90:57 - 91:02)
it might it&#39;s 45 minutes to get there (91:00 - 91:03)
and then I have to get back here that&#39;s (91:02 - 91:06)
another 45 minutes so there are (91:03 - 91:09)
definitely some cities some countries (91:06 - 91:11)
that have good public transportation (91:09 - 91:14)
that is easier to get around Jakarta was (91:11 - 91:18)
not one of them New York City famous for (91:14 - 91:19)
their public (91:18 - 91:21)
transportation they put it on rand&#39;s (91:19 - 91:23)
island it&#39;s a little bit a different (91:21 - 91:25)
specifically (91:23 - 91:27)
worked with the city of New York to say (91:25 - 91:29)
no Uber allowed (91:27 - 91:32)
here and then there was like a bus (91:29 - 91:34)
accident which like messed up that part (91:32 - 91:37)
of it (91:34 - 91:42)
oh anyways fantastic event um I am sure (91:37 - 91:44)
there are Pokemon go players that only (91:42 - 91:46)
came here for Pokemon go and probably (91:44 - 91:49)
had an amazing time I (91:46 - 91:52)
think once I saw there was more Pokemon (91:49 - 91:57)
stuff I gravitated to that more yeah and (91:52 - 91:58)
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s like a bad thing I (91:57 - 92:01)
don&#39;t uh there&#39;s debate whether Niantic (91:58 - 92:03)
did or do did not do the right thing of (92:01 - 92:06)
spawns or not spawns or what they were (92:03 - 92:07)
restricted to with the city there&#39;s also (92:06 - 92:09)
like safety to keep in mind that we (92:07 - 92:12)
didn&#39;t touch on of like maybe we should (92:09 - 92:14)
keep things condensed here so people (92:12 - 92:16)
aren&#39;t trying to walk across eight Lanes (92:14 - 92:20)
of unmarked traffic right well that I (92:16 - 92:21)
guess that goes into what I was saying (92:20 - 92:24)
about so I guess maybe I didn&#39;t really (92:21 - 92:25)
touch it but when you were talking about (92:24 - 92:26)
how there were so many different areas (92:25 - 92:30)
you could go to to play the city Safari (92:26 - 92:32)
it just feels like maybe that wasn&#39;t a (92:30 - 92:34)
good ide like maybe it should have been (92:32 - 92:37)
constricted to like two places maybe it (92:34 - 92:38)
should have been constricted been a (92:37 - 92:41)
safari zone instead of a city Safari (92:38 - 92:42)
yeah or if there aren&#39;t parks there to (92:41 - 92:45)
play in some other type of experience (92:42 - 92:48)
that you know that could have been uh (92:45 - 92:50)
just constricted to like maybe the two (92:48 - 92:52)
malls or something like that or or (92:50 - 92:54)
something in that way maybe make the (92:52 - 92:57)
argument that like well you can play (92:54 - 92:59)
anywhere in Jakarta so you don&#39;t feel (92:57 - 93:01)
like you need to drive 45 minutes (92:59 - 93:03)
somewhere to play you could just play in (93:01 - 93:06)
your neighborhood or something yeah if (93:03 - 93:08)
you&#39;re flying all the way there anyways (93:06 - 93:11)
I 45 minutes to the event like it&#39;s the (93:08 - 93:14)
extra it&#39;s an extra 45 minutes I&#39;m just (93:11 - 93:15)
thinking of like people who live in (93:14 - 93:18)
Indonesia uh I don&#39;t think course this (93:15 - 93:20)
is me speculating I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t (93:18 - 93:23)
think this event from the Pokémon Go (93:20 - 93:25)
Side did very well the reason I&#39;m (93:23 - 93:30)
speculating that is because um Niantic (93:25 - 93:33)
discounted the tickets 30% in the app (93:30 - 93:37)
and I&#39;ve never seen them discount (93:33 - 93:40)
Pokemon go tickets not only that is if (93:37 - 93:43)
you bought five or more tickets I think (93:40 - 93:45)
maybe it was six or more like if you (93:43 - 93:47)
bought like for your family it was (93:45 - 93:48)
discounted (93:47 - 93:51)
50% whoa in the app and they were (93:48 - 93:54)
advertising it at the pick um they had (93:51 - 93:57)
like little like flyers of like the map (93:54 - 93:59)
and like what it was it was not in engl (93:57 - 94:01)
that makes that makes some sense yeah (93:59 - 94:02)
especially at not being in English (94:01 - 94:04)
that&#39;s for people who are there with (94:02 - 94:05)
their families for the rest of the (94:04 - 94:10)
Pokemon event yeah yeah and it (94:05 - 94:12)
like I I I don&#39;t know the economy of (94:10 - 94:14)
Indonesia very well the dollar is (94:12 - 94:18)
incredibly strong in Indonesia um so (94:14 - 94:21)
like for me taking an Uber was (94:18 - 94:23)
incredibly cheap I don&#39;t know for an (94:21 - 94:26)
Indonesian person if how expensive that (94:23 - 94:28)
is like I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what (94:26 - 94:31)
their rupia is the currency like I don&#39;t (94:28 - 94:33)
know what the hourly rupia wages right (94:31 - 94:35)
like (94:33 - 94:38)
so like for for the US I think the (94:35 - 94:41)
ticket was like $12 and so 30% off would (94:38 - 94:46)
be like what like eight or $9 um so like (94:41 - 94:49)
to me $10 for casual Pokémon go for two (94:46 - 94:54)
days super good price um for a family % (94:49 - 94:59)
off I don&#39;t know like I I just don&#39;t (94:54 - 95:01)
know I I I don&#39;t know other people&#39;s (94:59 - 95:05)
budgets but like I&#39;ve never seen another (95:01 - 95:07)
Pokemon go event (95:05 - 95:10)
discounted before so I don&#39;t think it (95:07 - 95:14)
was doing very well to the leadup um but (95:10 - 95:15)
I don&#39;t know that&#39;s like a different (95:14 - 95:17)
conversation I guess yeah I don&#39;t know (95:15 - 95:18)
if (95:17 - 95:21)
that&#39;s because it wasn&#39;t doing well or (95:18 - 95:24)
it&#39;s because of economy stuff right was (95:21 - 95:25)
going say have you been to another (95:24 - 95:27)
Pokemon you haven&#39;t been to one of the (95:25 - 95:28)
other Pokémon go events in Indonesia (95:27 - 95:30)
right this was your first Indonesia one (95:28 - 95:32)
yeah this is the first time in Indonesia (95:30 - 95:34)
could be the just could be the area (95:32 - 95:37)
could be the way that it like um works (95:34 - 95:40)
yeah uh okay so goest go Safar has (95:37 - 95:43)
started here in inchon final (95:40 - 95:45)
day I have a lot of thoughts about this (95:43 - 95:49)
one too uh but we&#39;re running over but it (95:45 - 95:52)
is different it is restricted to a park (95:49 - 95:54)
there is no merch store there is no DJ (95:52 - 95:56)
Pikachu there is no EDM show there is no (95:54 - 96:00)
drone show it is a very traditional (95:56 - 96:02)
Pokemon go experience so we&#39;ll probably (96:00 - 96:05)
talk about that when when I get back (96:02 - 96:07)
City experience though real quick there (96:05 - 96:08)
is a city experience for as well right (96:07 - 96:10)
so you pick one day for the park and (96:08 - 96:13)
then anywhere in inchon just like (96:10 - 96:14)
anywhere in Jakarta you can play the (96:13 - 96:16)
other two day this was a three-day event (96:14 - 96:18)
Jakarta was a two-day event uh I want to (96:16 - 96:21)
end on this I found my new favorite fast (96:18 - 96:24)
food restaurant in the entire world it (96:21 - 96:27)
is called Shake Shake in a tub it is a (96:24 - 96:29)
Singaporean (96:27 - 96:34)
restaurant uh absolutely fantastic so (96:29 - 96:36)
good it&#39;s like uh it&#39;s like chicken and (96:34 - 96:39)
fries that they put in a tub and then (96:36 - 96:42)
they shake like a seasoning on it yes (96:39 - 96:45)
got it and it was sounds great (96:42 - 96:49)
phenomenal um so good I went to it 3 (96:45 - 96:54)
