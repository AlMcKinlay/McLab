pokemon uh diamond pokemon brilliant (1:56 - 2:01)
diamond and shining pearl update (1:59 - 2:03)
1.1.2 (2:01 - 2:05)
the patch notes (2:03 - 2:06)
um (2:05 - 2:08)
so we got an update that's pretty good (2:06 - 2:10)
it took him two weeks to do the first (2:08 - 2:12)
update now they did say there's an (2:10 - 2:14)
update coming to add (2:12 - 2:17)
eight players to the union room (2:14 - 2:19)
right now you can only have (2:17 - 2:21)
one other person in the union room (2:19 - 2:24)
i want to talk about that too uh so the (2:21 - 2:26)
update says here (2:24 - 2:28)
that (2:26 - 2:31)
what the union room oh this all just (2:28 - 2:33)
it never ceases to surprise and delight (2:31 - 2:35)
me with these things that i keep (2:33 - 2:37)
learning about that i had no idea were (2:35 - 2:39)
going on (2:37 - 2:39)
uh so (2:39 - 2:44)
nintendo said it fixed some issues that (2:42 - 2:46)
would prevent the game from progressing (2:44 - 2:48)
under certain circumstances (2:46 - 2:50)
some issues have been fixed for more (2:48 - 2:52)
pleasant gameplay (2:50 - 2:54)
um (2:52 - 2:56)
and the more detailed notes here is (2:54 - 2:58)
there was uh (2:56 - 3:00)
there was a way you could get soft (2:58 - 3:03)
locked before reaching snow point gym if (3:00 - 3:05)
you moved incorrectly you would be stuck (3:03 - 3:07)
unable to complete the gym (3:05 - 3:10)
that happened to people yep uh (3:07 - 3:12)
there was a bug that allowed you to surf (3:10 - 3:15)
on land and that would let you get the (3:12 - 3:18)
mythical pokemon shaman early that has (3:15 - 3:20)
been fixed (3:18 - 3:20)
there was a multiple duplication glitch (3:21 - 3:26)
that allowed you to clone pokemon that (3:24 - 3:27)
has been fixed (3:26 - 3:30)
some also involved menus and some (3:27 - 3:32)
involved the daycare the glitch also (3:30 - 3:36)
allowed you to duplicate many items (3:32 - 3:37)
um (3:36 - 3:38)
and it looks like if you did glitch a (3:37 - 3:40)
bunch of pokemon (3:38 - 3:43)
and you update you will still keep those (3:40 - 3:46)
glitched pokemon according to a (3:43 - 3:49)
subreddit that has tested this (3:46 - 3:49)
so the big thing here was like the menu (3:49 - 3:55)
yeah but here's the question did it i (3:52 - 3:57)
don't mention they if they fix the (3:55 - 4:01)
glitch where you can just bypass it (3:57 - 4:01)
that all had to do with the menu so the (4:10 - 4:12)
menu (4:12 - 4:15)
bug was the reason why people could surf (4:12 - 4:18)
on land or skip cynthia or ultimately (4:15 - 4:21)
skip literally every gym leader (4:18 - 4:22)
uh (4:21 - 4:24)
because you would you would pop the menu (4:22 - 4:26)
up on the menu (4:24 - 4:28)
and then the game would freak out had (4:26 - 4:31)
something to do with opening a door (4:28 - 4:32)
and then not closing the door and then (4:31 - 4:35)
uh like forcing the menu to pop up twice (4:32 - 4:37)
it was it was how speedrunners got to (4:35 - 4:39)
beat the game in like 20 minutes in like (4:37 - 4:41)
a minute and a half (4:39 - 4:42)
like whoop (4:41 - 4:44)
bye (4:42 - 4:44)
so that's that's been those have been (4:44 - 4:49)
patched uh the (4:46 - 4:51)
things that have not been patched uh you (4:49 - 4:53)
still stick to like every wall in the (4:51 - 4:55)
underground it's awful (4:53 - 4:56)
it's like so hard to run through the (4:55 - 4:58)
underground without (4:56 - 5:00)
i have never stuck why are you running (4:58 - 5:03)
you don't need to run enjoy your time (5:00 - 5:05)
do you know how long those hallways are (5:03 - 5:06)
look (5:05 - 5:09)
this game is nothing but hallways (5:06 - 5:11)
hallways hallways (5:09 - 5:13)
every every wild area is just a straight (5:11 - 5:15)
hallway to another wild area and it's (5:13 - 5:18)
awful the glitch is that you guys (5:15 - 5:20)
continue to use the joystick in a game (5:18 - 5:23)
that was clearly made for using the (5:20 - 5:25)
d-pad that's why i have never stuck to a (5:23 - 5:28)
wall anywhere listen here d-pad i use (5:25 - 5:30)
that d-pad plenty (5:28 - 5:32)
how dare you (5:30 - 5:37)
it may be accurate but how dare you (5:32 - 5:37)
you cannot d-pad (5:39 - 5:43)
you can d-pad in the hallways of the (5:41 - 5:45)
underground but not those rooms yeah (5:43 - 5:48)
these rooms have logs and trees and as (5:45 - 5:49)
soon as you get close to them they like (5:48 - 5:52)
magnet to you i d-pad all around him i'm (5:49 - 5:56)
good i'm good with the deep bad (5:52 - 5:56)
cancel the show right now um (5:58 - 6:02)
we still don't yet we still don't have (6:05 - 6:08)
the union room update (6:06 - 6:10)
the union room (6:08 - 6:11)
here's the thing about pokemon people (6:10 - 6:12)
are like (6:11 - 6:15)
oh man predict the pokemon so (6:12 - 6:17)
predictable after black and white we're (6:15 - 6:19)
gonna get pokemon gray after x and y (6:17 - 6:22)
we're gonna get pokemon z after (6:19 - 6:23)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee we're (6:22 - 6:26)
gonna get let's go johto no none of (6:23 - 6:27)
those are true do you know what's true (6:26 - 6:29)
the only thing that is predictable is (6:27 - 6:31)
every time they introduce an online (6:29 - 6:35)
system it gets worse and worse (6:31 - 6:38)
[Music] (6:35 - 6:40)
which is kind of funny because gen 4 was (6:38 - 6:43)
the introduction of online to pokemon (6:40 - 6:46)
games and now it's like we've come full (6:43 - 6:49)
circle they're full spiral (6:46 - 6:52)
toilet back to miserable (6:49 - 6:54)
the what was it the pss (6:52 - 6:56)
and then it was (6:54 - 6:58)
festival plaza yeah and then it was (6:56 - 7:01)
wycombe and now it is whatever this (6:58 - 7:03)
abomination that union room is (7:01 - 7:04)
which at this point they said they're (7:03 - 7:07)
gonna add more people but (7:04 - 7:09)
when you join a union room you have this (7:07 - 7:10)
huge room (7:09 - 7:12)
you can't do (7:10 - 7:14)
anything with the other person (7:12 - 7:16)
and all you could do is press the y (7:14 - 7:18)
button and then hit call (7:16 - 7:20)
and then that's it (7:18 - 7:21)
yeah (7:20 - 7:24)
and then you can trade or battle yep you (7:21 - 7:26)
call out what you want to do and then (7:24 - 7:28)
they will determine if they wish to do (7:26 - 7:30)
that with you (7:28 - 7:33)
and you can't do anything in the room (7:30 - 7:34)
like if you (7:33 - 7:37)
wanted to talk to the nurse person who (7:34 - 7:40)
says hey if you have questions (7:37 - 7:42)
ask me (7:40 - 7:43)
and i'm like but i know how to do these (7:42 - 7:46)
things my question is where is everybody (7:43 - 7:48)
if you want to attach a king's rock to a (7:46 - 7:50)
poliwhirl and then trade that to the (7:48 - 7:54)
only other person in this gigantic room (7:50 - 7:56)
you can't do you have to leave the union (7:54 - 7:57)
room (7:56 - 7:59)
to attach the king's rock and then have (7:57 - 8:01)
your pokemon ready before you walk in (7:59 - 8:02)
the room (8:01 - 8:05)
i'm doing nothing in this room (8:02 - 8:09)
let me do something (8:05 - 8:13)
it's it's really weird (8:09 - 8:16)
faithful remakes i guess is this the (8:13 - 8:17)
bitchiest (8:16 - 8:21)
pokemon game ever i mean i would argue (8:17 - 8:23)
that gen 1 (8:21 - 8:25)
beats it (8:23 - 8:28)
was a nightmare of glitches (8:25 - 8:30)
but i would i'm going to put this (8:28 - 8:33)
in a solid 2. (8:30 - 8:35)
i will because (8:33 - 8:36)
gen 1 was (8:35 - 8:38)
nothing worked in that game nothing (8:36 - 8:39)
worked right (8:38 - 8:42)
and they were there's no way to fix that (8:39 - 8:43)
it just (8:42 - 8:46)
it just was bad (8:43 - 8:47)
this (8:46 - 8:49)
boy this comes in this comes in a hot (8:47 - 8:53)
second also also also for all of you who (8:49 - 8:55)
have dared say (8:53 - 8:58)
following pokemon is so much better in (8:55 - 9:01)
this game than it is in sword and shield (8:58 - 9:04)
pull out of neckins and talk to me i (9:01 - 9:07)
push my poor pacharisu around until he's (9:04 - 9:11)
like i can't expect it anymore (9:07 - 9:11)
he's like i'm tired of you (9:11 - 9:14)
the look ilka they had to (9:15 - 9:19)
they had a lot of work to do they had to (9:18 - 9:22)
make a brand new region they had to you (9:19 - 9:24)
know create a brand new story there was (9:22 - 9:26)
a lot of new pokemon introduced in this (9:24 - 9:29)
game so for it being buggy for you know (9:26 - 9:32)
all the work that they didn't have to (9:29 - 9:34)
copy sarcasm doesn't work on podcasts (9:32 - 9:37)
here's the thing (9:34 - 9:39)
the old saying is it takes a lot more (9:37 - 9:42)
effort to ignore something to just do it (9:39 - 9:45)
and they were they just were ignoring (9:42 - 9:46)
every aspect of platinum that ever (9:45 - 9:48)
existed (9:46 - 9:49)
that's like a that took at least an (9:48 - 9:52)
entire team to ignore any life (9:49 - 9:53)
improvement that came in platinum yeah (9:52 - 9:55)
because you have to have somebody like (9:53 - 9:58)
going around because it's like jury duty (9:55 - 10:01)
where it's like it's impossible (9:58 - 10:05)
to find somebody who hasn't had some (10:01 - 10:07)
exposure to platinum right so they had (10:05 - 10:09)
to have somebody go around and like look (10:07 - 10:10)
over their shoulder it's like oh wait no (10:09 - 10:13)
no no no that's two platinum take you (10:10 - 10:14)
take that out (10:13 - 10:18)
stop no no two buttons two buttons what (10:14 - 10:19)
is this (10:18 - 10:22)
are we are we made of money (10:19 - 10:24)
we can afford one button and one button (10:22 - 10:26)
only (10:24 - 10:28)
look i think some of the stuff like i'm (10:26 - 10:30)
having a great time with the game still (10:28 - 10:33)
i have 70 hours into the game so i (10:30 - 10:35)
absolutely still adore it yes i agree so (10:33 - 10:38)
there are there are a lot of criticisms (10:35 - 10:41)
that really frustrate me about this game (10:38 - 10:42)
and i (10:41 - 10:44)
after spending some time in the (10:42 - 10:45)
underground still a lot of time in the (10:44 - 10:48)
underground i don't think it's good post (10:45 - 10:49)
game (10:48 - 10:50)
and (10:49 - 10:51)
the (10:50 - 10:56)
the wild area stuff in sword and shield (10:51 - 10:57)
they they did have the benefit of like (10:56 - 11:00)
rotating raids like every month we don't (10:57 - 11:02)
know if underground is going to rotate (11:00 - 11:03)
anything (11:02 - 11:05)
what would they rotate (11:03 - 11:07)
what i don't know what they would choose (11:05 - 11:11)
pokemon but but he like i think about (11:07 - 11:12)
so when you're you're you're doing the (11:11 - 11:15)
the farming mini or the mining minigame (11:12 - 11:16)
right (11:15 - 11:17)
so (11:16 - 11:19)
comparing the mining mini game to just (11:17 - 11:20)
doing max ray battles both are pretty (11:19 - 11:23)
simple both are pretty mindless right i (11:20 - 11:25)
mean you go in it's a fire type pokemon (11:23 - 11:27)
you bring a water you hit the water move (11:25 - 11:29)
twice it eventually dies it (11:27 - 11:32)
explodes and then you get your rewards (11:29 - 11:33)
and then you move on to the next one (11:32 - 11:35)
right i'm not (11:33 - 11:36)
when when you dumb it down (11:35 - 11:38)
lots of pokemon games have mindless (11:36 - 11:39)
things at the end (11:38 - 11:42)
but when i'm doing the mining game and (11:39 - 11:44)
i'm getting the statues and i'm getting (11:42 - 11:46)
the spheres and sometimes i'm getting a (11:44 - 11:49)
fossil i can't help but think (11:46 - 11:51)
what does another 20 hours look like (11:49 - 11:53)
what does another 100 hours look like (11:51 - 11:55)
what does another 500 hours look like (11:53 - 11:58)
because at a certain point (11:55 - 12:01)
i will have had all of the pokemon (11:58 - 12:03)
and i will probably have all of these (12:01 - 12:04)
statues (12:03 - 12:06)
and the game is going to continue giving (12:04 - 12:08)
me statues (12:06 - 12:09)
to (12:08 - 12:11)
then attract pokemon (12:09 - 12:12)
that i don't need (12:11 - 12:14)
at a certain point (12:12 - 12:16)
i'm going to have max watch her statues (12:14 - 12:19)
probably in the next 20 hours (12:16 - 12:21)
so what is my next 800 hours in this (12:19 - 12:23)
game looks like look like full shiny (12:21 - 12:27)
living snow pokedex because i can't (12:23 - 12:30)
sell the statues i can only put as (12:27 - 12:32)
x amount of statues in a room right (12:30 - 12:34)
there's a limit and even if you make the (12:32 - 12:37)
room bigger there's still a limit (12:34 - 12:37)
and like does putting i don't know does (12:37 - 12:42)
putting all (12:40 - 12:45)
very color statues like let's say i have (12:42 - 12:46)
nothing but color they're called color (12:45 - 12:49)
statues i don't like that term or i (12:46 - 12:51)
don't like it just doesn't it just (12:49 - 12:53)
very lazy (12:51 - 12:55)
um (12:53 - 12:58)
if having a max room with max color (12:55 - 13:00)
statues and all those statues are like (12:58 - 13:02)
water does that mean like (13:00 - 13:04)
i get nothing but squirtles or laprases (13:02 - 13:06)
or am i still saying barb which is (13:04 - 13:07)
intense curl like what does that look (13:06 - 13:11)
like but even even in that sense (13:07 - 13:13)
i'm going to continue getting statues (13:11 - 13:14)
that i don't need i'm going to get (13:13 - 13:16)
continue getting spheres i don't need at (13:14 - 13:18)
a certain point (13:16 - 13:19)
it's exciting to get like your first (13:18 - 13:21)
omanite (13:19 - 13:22)
not that exciting to get twenty oma (13:21 - 13:25)
nights what am i gonna do like (13:22 - 13:27)
like i mean you get your first five leaf (13:25 - 13:29)
stones what am i gonna do with 20 leaf (13:27 - 13:31)
stones it just doesn't give them to me i (13:29 - 13:33)
got nothing but fire so it's got zero (13:31 - 13:35)
leaf stones over i i believe you've (13:33 - 13:38)
confused this game with animal crossing (13:35 - 13:40)
that's the problem (13:38 - 13:43)
you're not building a museum here is the (13:40 - 13:45)
like the underground is the post game is (13:43 - 13:47)
it not like what else am i supposed to (13:45 - 13:50)
do like i have to go downtown (13:47 - 13:51)
class (13:50 - 13:54)
what the battle tower master class yeah (13:51 - 13:56)
i can do that too but i have to go down (13:54 - 13:59)
there to get all the shows (13:56 - 14:01)
yeah i can do that too yeah yes (13:59 - 14:03)
we just gave you two examples of what (14:01 - 14:04)
you're supposed to do in the post game (14:03 - 14:07)
that's not the underground (14:04 - 14:08)
so (14:07 - 14:11)
stop playing animal crossing you can (14:08 - 14:13)
cook in sword and shield (14:11 - 14:14)
understand you can do the battle tower (14:13 - 14:17)
and sword and shield understand i but (14:14 - 14:18)
like if we're if we're comparing the (14:17 - 14:22)
underground to the wild area (14:18 - 14:24)
well i'm not comparing the underground (14:22 - 14:27)
the mining minigame (14:24 - 14:29)
is going to run flat very quickly for a (14:27 - 14:31)
lot of people has anyone written a guide (14:29 - 14:33)
to the mining mini game (14:31 - 14:34)
what (14:33 - 14:36)
hit the wall hope you hit something (14:34 - 14:38)
what's the what's the guy because that (14:36 - 14:41)
over complicated how do you optimize (14:38 - 14:44)
your taps so that you don't tap out too (14:41 - 14:45)
soon (14:44 - 14:47)
you go in a diagonal pattern because if (14:45 - 14:51)
you hit crosses it opens bigger squares (14:47 - 14:52)
you use the heavy hammer to get through (14:51 - 14:54)
the solid rocks you try to get down to (14:52 - 14:55)
the part and then you chip away what do (14:54 - 14:57)
you mean you go with a friend who's (14:55 - 14:58)
gonna follow you around so that their (14:57 - 15:00)
wax don't count (14:58 - 15:02)
fossils here (15:00 - 15:05)
i found exactly what fossil this entire (15:02 - 15:06)
game (15:05 - 15:07)
and (15:06 - 15:09)
none others (15:07 - 15:11)
you gotta i found more fossils when it's (15:09 - 15:14)
not in diglett time (15:11 - 15:16)
if it's in diglett time i never find (15:14 - 15:18)
fossils i look i don't play with other (15:16 - 15:19)
people (15:18 - 15:23)
i go by myself it's never diglett time (15:19 - 15:25)
it is just me time and i still haven't (15:23 - 15:27)
found a puzzle i think the uh the mini (15:25 - 15:29)
game the uh the digging mini game would (15:27 - 15:32)
be more exciting and more interesting if (15:29 - 15:35)
the items i just named weren't the only (15:32 - 15:36)
items (15:35 - 15:38)
again at a certain point you're not (15:36 - 15:39)
going to need statues you're not going (15:38 - 15:40)
to need fossils you're not going to need (15:39 - 15:42)
those (15:40 - 15:44)
spheres (15:42 - 15:46)
you get everstones you get heart scales (15:44 - 15:47)
you get (15:46 - 15:49)
oh yeah i got all kinds of scales (15:47 - 15:50)
don't matter though because once you get (15:49 - 15:51)
10 (15:50 - 15:53)
that god gives you unlimited you only (15:51 - 15:55)
need the first ten (15:53 - 15:57)
and then he's he then he's like it's (15:55 - 15:59)
unlimited now you don't don't give me (15:57 - 16:01)
any more yeah i don't i found one (15:59 - 16:03)
i still need to find 10 and i can't find (16:01 - 16:04)
a second (16:03 - 16:06)
i think the digging game would be more (16:04 - 16:10)
exciting if i was eight years old (16:06 - 16:12)
and there you go yeah that's part of the (16:10 - 16:14)
problem if the digging forty years too (16:12 - 16:16)
late for ten digging games (16:14 - 16:19)
had nuggets had stardust (16:16 - 16:22)
had um (16:19 - 16:25)
uh the xl candy like why is there no xl (16:22 - 16:26)
candy down here why is there no like (16:25 - 16:28)
little like cookie jar that you can dig (16:26 - 16:30)
up and then when you open the cookie jar (16:28 - 16:31)
there's like oh there's like three xl (16:30 - 16:34)
candy like (16:31 - 16:36)
the rarest thing i have found in the (16:34 - 16:41)
last two weeks is one max revive and (16:36 - 16:42)
i don't need that (16:41 - 16:44)
give me a like i'm just give me a nugget (16:42 - 16:46)
that's at least 5 000 pokey coins or (16:44 - 16:49)
whatever like why are those not in there (16:46 - 16:51)
why can i not (16:49 - 16:53)
talk to one of the useless people down (16:51 - 16:54)
in the underground because there's a (16:53 - 16:55)
bunch of them the only ones that (16:54 - 16:58)
actually do anything are the hikers (16:55 - 17:00)
and say like hey can i go the other ones (16:58 - 17:01)
allow you to talk to them to count (17:00 - 17:05)
towards the secret thing can i change my (17:01 - 17:07)
pickaxe like this pickaxe is more likely (17:05 - 17:10)
to get stardust or pearls or nuggets (17:07 - 17:12)
this package is more likely to get (17:10 - 17:13)
spheres this pickaxe is more likely to (17:12 - 17:15)
get statues this pickaxe is more likely (17:13 - 17:19)
to get fossils like it just seems why (17:15 - 17:22)
would a pickaxe change what's in hidden (17:19 - 17:24)
in the walls why does (17:22 - 17:25)
why does a (17:24 - 17:28)
clam evolve into a fish with a bra we (17:25 - 17:30)
can't answer because on this podcast (17:28 - 17:32)
that is evolution that is literally how (17:30 - 17:36)
evolution works look look up look up (17:32 - 17:37)
look it up (17:36 - 17:38)
how did you go from listening to us (17:37 - 17:40)
that's called you cannot apply the (17:38 - 17:42)
faithful remake to the (17:40 - 17:45)
grand underground which is dramatically (17:42 - 17:49)
different than the original underground (17:45 - 17:52)
you can find some special things (17:49 - 17:53)
for everything you can find in the (17:52 - 17:55)
stupid digging up thing it's just hard (17:53 - 17:57)
for me to believe (17:55 - 17:59)
excited about the grand underground when (17:57 - 18:02)
it's just so (17:59 - 18:04)
one note (18:02 - 18:06)
it's not like they didn't have 24 years (18:04 - 18:08)
of other pokemon games to look at (18:06 - 18:11)
okay here's the special things you can (18:08 - 18:14)
get in the underground revive max revive (18:11 - 18:16)
red shirts are not special shard green (18:14 - 18:18)
shards sunstone moonstone firestone (18:16 - 18:20)
thunderstorm waterstone leaf stone oval (18:18 - 18:23)

read by greg (18:55 - 18:59)
he's a much better list reader than (18:56 - 19:01)
steve i have gotten (18:59 - 19:02)
three (19:01 - 19:05)
smooth rocks do you have an iron ball (19:02 - 19:07)
yet i don't have an iron no one needs (19:05 - 19:10)
three smooth rocks no one even needs one (19:07 - 19:13)
smooth ride i have an all sans (19:10 - 19:15)
sandstream team i need everybody to have (19:13 - 19:19)
rocks to make that last forever (19:15 - 19:19)
also i swear i thought the damp rock i (19:23 - 19:26)
didn't find a damp rock i thought it was (19:25 - 19:28)
covered in ice and i'm like oh it's the (19:26 - 19:30)
ice rock no (19:28 - 19:33)
it's it's covered in solid water which (19:30 - 19:37)
is ice i don't understand (19:33 - 19:39)
you hit the ice rock with a flamethrower (19:37 - 19:41)
and it becomes the damp rock (19:39 - 19:45)
this is just science it's evolution (19:41 - 19:47)
uh here i just wanna (19:45 - 19:50)
hot tip (19:47 - 19:51)
hot (19:50 - 19:55)
tip if you care about contests (19:51 - 19:57)
you have to unfortunately care about (19:55 - 19:59)
poffins (19:57 - 20:00)
here's your hot tip (19:59 - 20:03)
never make your poffins in that old (20:00 - 20:05)
lady's house she's a scam (20:03 - 20:06)
she scams you (20:05 - 20:09)
never go in there (20:06 - 20:09)
yeah she's the one that like tells you (20:09 - 20:13)
about poffins oh oh yeah (20:11 - 20:14)
you can yeah (20:13 - 20:17)
yeah yeah no you have to do that you (20:14 - 20:20)
have to go to the the amity square yeah (20:17 - 20:23)
and you have to bring in the (20:20 - 20:26)
uh border patrol approved pokemon that (20:23 - 20:28)
they allow you (20:26 - 20:30)
because they're very judgey and what you (20:28 - 20:31)
they're very judgy about what cute is (20:30 - 20:33)
and i've had this problem since the game (20:31 - 20:36)
created 15 years ago it's it's it's (20:33 - 20:38)
insane what they they classify cute or (20:36 - 20:40)
not (20:38 - 20:42)
so it doesn't matter if the pokemon (20:40 - 20:44)
you're bringing in are like level one (20:42 - 20:46)
level 10 none if you've never used them (20:44 - 20:49)
before just you need to bring in six (20:46 - 20:52)
approved border list pokemon (20:49 - 20:53)
and (20:52 - 20:55)
the if you bring in all six you're gonna (20:53 - 20:57)
get better poffins i've tested this in (20:55 - 20:59)
the old ladies house i got like a level (20:57 - 21:02)
seven poffin and then i went to the amit (20:59 - 21:05)
uh amity square yep and i brought in one (21:02 - 21:07)
pokemon and it was like a level 20 (21:05 - 21:08)
poffin and then i brought in three (21:07 - 21:12)
pokemon and it was a level 35 poffin and (21:08 - 21:13)
then you bring in six pokemon it's like (21:12 - 21:16)
a level 70 poffin so bring it (21:13 - 21:16)
have to be approved okay correct (21:21 - 21:25)
just do all evie (21:23 - 21:28)
you could yeah the game loves evie just (21:25 - 21:31)
say hey i have 18 million eevee don't (21:28 - 21:33)
you have to go single eevee in this game (21:31 - 21:36)
you get it end game yeah because when (21:33 - 21:38)
you introduce two brand new pokemon you (21:36 - 21:40)
make sure that those players have to (21:38 - 21:42)
suffer through your story in order to (21:40 - 21:45)
see the two new pokemon (21:42 - 21:45)
it sounds like you have issues regarding (21:46 - 21:49)
brilliant diamond shining bro would you (21:48 - 21:51)
like to discuss that first i'm waiting (21:49 - 21:53)
for perfect platinum (21:51 - 21:54)
to come well (21:53 - 21:56)
it already happened it happened (21:54 - 22:01)
14 years ago that game was perfect (21:56 - 22:04)
i'm waiting for the perfect platinum dlc (22:01 - 22:07)
uh (22:04 - 22:07)
like the game has a lot of ribbons i'm (22:07 - 22:10)
into that (22:09 - 22:13)
yeah only you like ribbons you and the (22:10 - 22:14)
fact that you brainwashed your twitch (22:13 - 22:17)
chat to also care about ribbons ribbons (22:14 - 22:18)
are cool (22:17 - 22:20)
i would rather get a million ribbons on (22:18 - 22:23)
a pokemon than my 15th smooth rock (22:20 - 22:24)
but the (22:23 - 22:26)
smooth rock at least does something (22:24 - 22:28)
ribbons do (22:26 - 22:31)
nothing exactly yeah they are they are (22:28 - 22:33)
the epitome of epeen and that was not (22:31 - 22:36)
even interesting in the early 2000s (22:33 - 22:38)
look greg just because you don't love (22:36 - 22:40)
your pokemon like i do oh my pokemon (22:38 - 22:43)
love me and i love my pokemon plenty i (22:40 - 22:46)
do not need somebody's outside approval (22:43 - 22:48)
of our relationship i don't need to go (22:46 - 22:49)
to some (22:48 - 22:50)
judgy (22:49 - 22:52)
footprint person in a cabin who's like (22:50 - 22:54)
oh you haven't walked enough you know (22:52 - 22:57)
what i walked through mount cornett 50 (22:54 - 23:00)
000 times face 5 million geodudes with (22:57 - 23:01)
this person and you're going to sit (23:00 - 23:03)
there and say oh you haven't walked (23:01 - 23:05)
enough with this one i'm not going to do (23:03 - 23:07)
anything for you i don't need your (23:05 - 23:09)
judgments i don't need your commentary (23:07 - 23:12)
on my life this whole game (23:09 - 23:14)
i am so the opposite i should probably (23:12 - 23:16)
talk to my therapist about the fact that (23:14 - 23:19)
whenever uh pokemon gets too close to me (23:16 - 23:21)
i i put it in a box and never talk to me (23:19 - 23:22)
energy root it here eat this bitter (23:21 - 23:24)
stuff (23:22 - 23:26)
no i just like i'm like oh you're you (23:24 - 23:28)
you're max friendship with me please go (23:26 - 23:29)
away please i don't want max friendship (23:28 - 23:31)
with pokemon (23:29 - 23:33)
hop hop (23:31 - 23:35)
it's it's a it's a losing battle on this (23:33 - 23:37)
show we got (23:35 - 23:38)
we we we had (23:37 - 23:41)
a handful of people complain we were too (23:38 - 23:43)
positive about sword and shield and we (23:41 - 23:46)
were only positive because that's how (23:43 - 23:49)
this show doesn't make any money (23:46 - 23:51)
clearly (23:49 - 23:53)
and then (23:51 - 23:54)
now there's like a handful of people (23:53 - 23:57)
that are like you're too negative (23:54 - 23:59)
and there's a bunch of people who are (23:57 - 24:01)
like you're not enough like will (23:59 - 24:03)
be like will will super positive and (24:01 - 24:05)
loves this game i mean i do love this (24:03 - 24:08)
game it's true will also has two gym (24:05 - 24:10)
matches (24:08 - 24:13)
excuse me i have made it to bail stone (24:10 - 24:15)
and turned around to go back to make (24:13 - 24:17)
sure that i finish everything along that (24:15 - 24:19)
route (24:17 - 24:20)
don't worry you'll find (24:19 - 24:23)
17 trainers hiding in the grass (24:20 - 24:26)
i'm very excited for the um rancher and (24:23 - 24:28)
his daughter to battle me (24:26 - 24:31)
[Laughter] (24:28 - 24:33)
five (24:31 - 24:33)
um (24:34 - 24:36)
it i think the frustrating part is the (24:37 - 24:42)
game is like almost there (24:39 - 24:42)
like there are things that are like oh (24:44 - 24:47)
cool and then there are things they're (24:46 - 24:49)
like why did you do this just a few more (24:47 - 24:51)
patches you know just a few more patches (24:49 - 24:54)
and we'll get a pokemon game (24:51 - 24:55)
yeah (24:54 - 24:58)
it is a pokemon game (24:55 - 25:00)
uh speaking (24:58 - 25:03)
of a game that is (25:00 - 25:05)
now there (25:03 - 25:06)
maybe a week ago we would have said (25:05 - 25:09)
almost there but now it's there (25:06 - 25:11)
pokemon go (25:09 - 25:15)
runs much smoother on iphones (25:11 - 25:16)
you can unlock the frame rate in (25:15 - 25:18)
settings (25:16 - 25:21)
with version 1.191.0 (25:18 - 25:21)
very easy to remember (25:22 - 25:26)
if you go to the advanced sec settings (25:23 - 25:29)
section of the app you can uh (25:26 - 25:31)
hit an option that says unlock your (25:29 - 25:34)
device's native refresh rate for higher (25:31 - 25:36)
fps (25:34 - 25:39)
i did this i have an iphone 13 mini by (25:36 - 25:41)
the way i don't have the (25:39 - 25:45)

differences what (28:19 - 28:25)
okay the list came up (28:22 - 28:26)
point one second (28:25 - 28:28)
it's not about speed it's about the (28:26 - 28:31)
beauty of the graphics the smoothness (28:28 - 28:37)

but you can feel it too when you're (29:00 - 29:04)
spinning the ball (29:02 - 29:04)
i i will say the menus are faster (29:05 - 29:11)

brand new and so fresh and fast and (36:50 - 36:54)
smooth oh it's it's it's incredible i (36:52 - 36:58)
don't get how you don't see it we can't (36:54 - 37:00)
spend this whole program (36:58 - 37:01)
with (37:00 - 37:04)
obviously greg's either glaucoma or (37:01 - 37:06)
cataracts that are prevented (37:04 - 37:08)
from seeing how dare (37:06 - 37:10)
[Laughter] (37:08 - 37:12)
just because you all have convinced (37:10 - 37:13)
yourself it's brand new and fresh (37:12 - 37:15)
because you just flipped a toggle and (37:13 - 37:17)
you've got you have to convince yourself (37:15 - 37:19)
that flipping the toggle was worth it oh (37:17 - 37:20)
good (37:19 - 37:22)
i flipped a toggle therefore it must be (37:20 - 37:24)
good it has to be good please (37:22 - 37:28)
yes please brain make it better for me (37:24 - 37:31)
look at how fast this menu is (37:28 - 37:32)
i i (37:31 - 37:35)
i was talking to a friend (37:32 - 37:38)
about pogo not about the toggle (37:35 - 37:40)
and they didn't even know that the game (37:38 - 37:43)
had seasons (37:40 - 37:43)
like i was like oh yeah the season of (37:44 - 37:47)
heritage started and they were like is (37:45 - 37:48)
this the first time they've done seasons (37:47 - 37:50)
and i was like no the last season was (37:48 - 37:52)
the season of mischief and they're like (37:50 - 37:55)
oh did that have to do with hoopa (37:52 - 37:55)
filthy casual to be fair i couldn't (37:59 - 38:02)
remember what the season was called (38:01 - 38:05)
before the season of season of mischief (38:02 - 38:06)
i think it was like this season of (38:05 - 38:08)
discovery maybe (38:06 - 38:10)
the season of legends it might have been (38:08 - 38:12)
the seasons of legends i think it was (38:10 - 38:14)
discovery then legends then (38:12 - 38:17)
mischief now heritage (38:14 - 38:18)
i think this season thing is cool for (38:17 - 38:20)
pogo i don't think it's i think it's i'm (38:18 - 38:22)
glad they're doing seasons it's kind of (38:20 - 38:24)
weird there's no like i would argue that (38:22 - 38:26)
it's not that effective if people could (38:24 - 38:28)
be like their seasons in this game (38:26 - 38:30)
it's it's only the hardcore players who (38:28 - 38:32)
realize it's happening well i think this (38:30 - 38:34)
is the one this is the first time when (38:32 - 38:37)
you go into your menu it says like (38:34 - 38:40)
season of heritage (38:37 - 38:42)
have you seen the season of misuse (38:40 - 38:45)
before it did it yeah now at the very (38:42 - 38:47)
top there's like the actual logo oh yeah (38:45 - 38:48)
no this is the first time that the logo (38:47 - 38:49)
at the top yeah they changed the (38:48 - 38:51)
background to put the logo at the top (38:49 - 38:52)
they did do that and they just looks (38:51 - 38:54)
exactly the same as it did before before (38:52 - 38:57)
i hit this toggle fyi (38:54 - 38:59)
but you could you saw that logo like .3 (38:57 - 39:02)
seconds faster you realize oh (38:59 - 39:02)
they get it in your brain they get it (39:03 - 39:07)
slightly faster slightly faster i can go (39:04 - 39:10)
wow that's annoying me faster this time (39:07 - 39:11)
uh (39:10 - 39:13)
i i am shocked there's no like season (39:11 - 39:17)
pass yet for these seasons (39:13 - 39:17)
like that that is just the thing you do (39:17 - 39:20)
you introduce a new season you charge (39:19 - 39:22)
people 10 bucks they get like (39:20 - 39:24)
here's your free track here's your p i'm (39:22 - 39:25)

don't know if i didn't read the ticket (40:18 - 40:21)
greg i don't know i just bought it i (40:19 - 40:23)
don't know what he does covered this on (40:21 - 40:26)
this program multiple times it just (40:23 - 40:27)
unlocks (40:26 - 40:30)
unbound hoopa i know exactly it's like (40:27 - 40:32)
that's all it does you paid five dollars (40:30 - 40:35)
for a bottle i paid eight dollars for a (40:32 - 40:37)
mr mom (40:35 - 40:40)
yeah because you're a fool and you also (40:37 - 40:41)
believe the game is better now because (40:40 - 40:43)
we need to toggle left you are not a (40:41 - 40:44)
voice (40:43 - 40:46)
we can't take back the game is better (40:44 - 40:49)
because of this update the the 4.99 was (40:46 - 40:51)
a was a rip off those are two separate (40:49 - 40:52)
things greg (40:51 - 40:55)
what about valerian mr mine i cannot (40:52 - 40:57)
believe i still cannot believe you paid (40:55 - 41:00)
money for the mime event i am (40:57 - 41:03)
mind blown that you do these things it's (41:00 - 41:04)
just i (41:03 - 41:07)
i this is bobby's bad influence on you (41:04 - 41:09)
you know actually i cannot i cannot (41:07 - 41:10)
remember full disclosure sometimes (41:09 - 41:13)
niantic gives me tickets to events they (41:10 - 41:15)
gave me two tickets to the st louis (41:13 - 41:16)
event (41:15 - 41:18)
but i gave those tickets away (41:16 - 41:20)
um they did give me tickets to like (41:18 - 41:21)
communities like the last communion day (41:20 - 41:22)
which was shanks they gave me a free (41:21 - 41:24)
ticket to be fair i can't completely (41:22 - 41:27)
remember if the mime was free for me or (41:24 - 41:28)
not (41:27 - 41:29)
but if it wasn't i would have paid the (41:28 - 41:33)
eight dollars just let's just be clear (41:29 - 41:36)
there i but we talked about this at the (41:33 - 41:40)
time i would have used all the items the (41:36 - 41:44)
raid passes the incense the star pieces (41:40 - 41:46)
it was worth it to me in that instance (41:44 - 41:48)
but i understand if you don't use those (41:46 - 41:48)
items (41:48 - 41:51)
not worth it to you the game is faster (41:48 - 41:54)
greg i hit the toggle it feels better it (41:51 - 41:56)
looks better it plays better it feels (41:54 - 41:58)
better organic produce tastes the same (41:56 - 42:01)
as regular produce (41:58 - 42:01)
don't get me started on gmos greg we (42:01 - 42:05)
don't have enough time (42:04 - 42:06)
you don't have (42:05 - 42:09)
the even b basic understanding about (42:06 - 42:11)

but they get nothing as a result of it (43:01 - 43:06)
because nobody's shopping there so why (43:05 - 43:09)
would they send product to a to an empty (43:06 - 43:11)
target if you need your basics you go to (43:09 - 43:13)
my target (43:11 - 43:14)

my recyclables in a plastic bag and they (43:56 - 44:00)

environment no no no beyond that i gotta (44:22 - 44:28)
put paper bags now why but why are you (44:25 - 44:29)
making that effort you could just (44:28 - 44:32)
literally just throw loose garbage in (44:29 - 44:34)
the recycle bin they don't ask you to (44:32 - 44:37)
bind it in any way correct you just (44:34 - 44:39)
shove it the thing it's all one (44:37 - 44:40)
recycling (44:39 - 44:41)
the only thing that paper basically is (44:40 - 44:43)
probably taking the recycling out to the (44:41 - 44:45)
recycling (44:43 - 44:46)
like (44:45 - 44:48)
you put the recycling up to your back (44:46 - 44:50)

the coin one is the pin i see i see i (46:42 - 46:45)

unless they didn't stock them it or (46:51 - 46:54)
they're sold out (46:52 - 46:56)
they're probably sold out you know who (46:54 - 46:58)
probably has my target you know what (46:56 - 47:00)
target does have it's exclusive to (46:58 - 47:01)
target not specifically minnesota (47:00 - 47:03)

can see those squid they're like (47:23 - 47:26)
stretched there's they're like stress (47:24 - 47:28)
ball material whatever that is probably (47:26 - 47:29)
non-recyclable (47:28 - 47:32)
they're definitely not recyclable (47:29 - 47:33)
because why would you recycle your (47:32 - 47:35)
stress (47:33 - 47:38)
uh also for pokemon center they (47:35 - 47:40)
also parted news here they launched some (47:38 - 47:45)

they really dropped the ball here on (48:38 - 48:40)
rose raid (48:39 - 48:42)
rosa raids (48:40 - 48:44)

uncomfortable on this plush (48:44 - 48:51)
it's craig it's a bad plush it's it's (48:48 - 48:53)

they really they really did rosary dirty (48:57 - 49:02)
here i mean (48:59 - 49:02)
it's not great they i mean they (49:04 - 49:10)
i i i would argue they didn't do cranny (49:08 - 49:13)
dose any favors either (49:10 - 49:15)
i would argue that a lot of the gen 4 (49:13 - 49:18)
ones are not (49:15 - 49:20)
good (49:18 - 49:23)
like why is badou (49:20 - 49:26)
as wide as the titanic what is like why (49:23 - 49:28)
what is happening here this thing is (49:26 - 49:32)

that base (49:32 - 49:36)

wait there's (49:36 - 49:38)

pikachu expressions face masks and none (49:38 - 49:43)
of you told me yeah they did do the face (49:40 - 49:46)

face masks like to make my (49:46 - 49:51)
skin better that kind of thing no no (49:47 - 49:52)
breath in (49:51 - 49:55)
oh (49:52 - 49:55)
uh (49:58 - 50:02)
oh (50:00 - 50:04)
i went to new releases and the sitting (50:02 - 50:07)
cuties are really weirdly spread out (50:04 - 50:09)
and not clumped together yeah they've (50:07 - 50:11)
yeah it's it's weird that they didn't (50:09 - 50:13)
put them together uh this is off twitter (50:11 - 50:14)
off (50:13 - 50:16)
at the wand company just in time for the (50:14 - 50:18)
holidays the pokemon premiere ball (50:16 - 50:20)
replica is now available (50:18 - 50:22)
uh and they have a full list of (50:20 - 50:24)
pokeballs on their website here but this (50:22 - 50:28)
is the sixth one i think have you bought (50:24 - 50:31)
every single one (50:28 - 50:31)
yeah (50:31 - 50:34)
oh my god do they have a heel ball (50:32 - 50:36)
do they have a luxury ball because (50:34 - 50:38)
they're not the only one they want (50:36 - 50:39)
heel ball is not available for pre-order (50:38 - 50:41)
yet so they have (50:39 - 50:43)
the pokeball (50:41 - 50:44)
and then they release the master ball (50:43 - 50:46)
which was only limited pokemon center (50:44 - 50:50)
only five thousand made okay um (50:46 - 50:50)
that was 120 (50:51 - 50:56)
20 more and the great ball the ultra (50:52 - 50:58)
ball the dusk ball which you can still (50:56 - 50:59)
pre-order (50:58 - 51:02)
not out yet though (50:59 - 51:04)
i mean i will order the luxury ball like (51:02 - 51:06)
and then this would be real the premiere (51:04 - 51:10)
ball which just went up for pre-order (51:06 - 51:10)
so that's two four (51:11 - 51:15)
six (51:13 - 51:17)
and then the heel ball is eventually (51:15 - 51:20)
coming so there was like a toy show (51:17 - 51:22)
like a month or two ago that's where (51:20 - 51:23)
they first showed off the dust ball and (51:22 - 51:25)
the heel ball (51:23 - 51:27)
we don't know if they're gonna do luxury (51:25 - 51:28)
we don't know if they're doing moon we (51:27 - 51:31)
don't know if anything else is coming (51:28 - 51:33)
no luxury no sail (51:31 - 51:35)
i've been using a lot of heel balls in (51:33 - 51:37)
cino (51:35 - 51:39)
it's a new thing for me i've never used (51:37 - 51:42)
before but i feel motivated to do so now (51:39 - 51:45)
this is this is the the the funko (51:42 - 51:48)
problem they're like here's the (51:45 - 51:49)
every month you get a new pikachu funko (51:48 - 51:50)
and you're like well i've already (51:49 - 51:53)
collected seven there's five more left i (51:50 - 51:55)
might as well finish the collection this (51:53 - 51:58)
is a you problem (51:55 - 52:00)
this is this is uh i i've been told this (51:58 - 52:02)
is a worldwide problem people like (52:00 - 52:04)
collecting things people do like (52:02 - 52:06)
collecting things but people if you have (52:04 - 52:09)
48 of the 50 united states coins would (52:06 - 52:12)
you not want the last two coins no (52:09 - 52:14)
why do i one why do i want the coins to (52:12 - 52:17)
begin with (52:14 - 52:19)
are you not into collecting the coins (52:17 - 52:21)
no quarters quarters might be worth (52:19 - 52:23)
something late later like they will (52:21 - 52:26)
never be worth something later the only (52:23 - 52:27)
ones that are worth something later is (52:26 - 52:30)
when they mess up the printing job and (52:27 - 52:32)
that is like winning the lottery so i (52:30 - 52:34)
might as well just grab one off the (52:32 - 52:36)
street and if it's got a misprint i'm (52:34 - 52:39)
like bonanza i've won otherwise no why (52:36 - 52:42)
do i need that in my house (52:39 - 52:45)
we we inherited a coin collection from (52:42 - 52:48)
brent's grandparents that is literally (52:45 - 52:50)
just sitting in my room because i do not (52:48 - 52:53)
know what to do with it so stephen (52:50 - 52:55)
who where (52:53 - 52:57)
i'm not put i am not letting some weird (52:55 - 52:59)
weirdo on ebay (52:57 - 53:01)
get a hand of my (52:59 - 53:03)
in-law grandparents ancient coin (53:01 - 53:04)
collection i don't know what they're (53:03 - 53:06)
going to do with this store take it to (53:04 - 53:07)
what not just (53:06 - 53:10)
gotta find a new pawn shop (53:07 - 53:12)
pawn shop pawn shop no okay i will look (53:10 - 53:13)
specific (53:12 - 53:16)
the the new noobity doobities are that i (53:13 - 53:17)
will look up (53:16 - 53:18)
at minneapolis and see what pulls up (53:17 - 53:21)
there you go i think the juan company (53:18 - 53:24)
pokeballs (53:21 - 53:26)
i think they're great (53:24 - 53:28)
i think for are they hundred dollars (53:26 - 53:31)
great yeah i i i do mine great (53:28 - 53:35)
what can they catch actual pokemon no (53:31 - 53:37)
they don't work do they here's the thing (53:35 - 53:38)
if somebody broke into your house and (53:37 - 53:40)
you whipped this at their head oh (53:38 - 53:42)
they're going down these things are (53:40 - 53:45)
heavy so we're tick tock now and if (53:42 - 53:46)
somebody broke in your house that's what (53:45 - 53:50)
you would use to defend yourself yeah (53:46 - 53:50)
like these things are like like probably (53:50 - 53:54)
is not that good (53:52 - 53:57)
i i have played pool (53:54 - 54:00)
maybe it's not throwing anything what is (53:57 - 54:03)
pool gotta do with this maybe tw listen (54:00 - 54:05)
i've played pool like twice (54:03 - 54:07)
i would say this is probably heavier (54:05 - 54:09)
than a pool ball (54:07 - 54:11)
and a pool ball is pretty dangerous (54:09 - 54:13)
you don't want to get hit by a pool ball (54:11 - 54:15)
a pool ball is dangerous depending on (54:13 - 54:18)
who throws it well yeah me throwing it (54:15 - 54:21)
one not not hard because it'd be like a (54:18 - 54:25)
light breeze tapping my jacket (54:21 - 54:27)
there's no accuracy here i'm definitely (54:25 - 54:28)
missing (54:27 - 54:30)
i would probably say if you threw this (54:28 - 54:32)
pokeball at the wall you would probably (54:30 - 54:34)
put a hole in your drywall (54:32 - 54:36)
it's not hard to put a hole in drywall (54:34 - 54:37)
yeah (54:36 - 54:41)
drywall is meant to have holes in it (54:37 - 54:41)
i think they're you know they're i think (54:43 - 54:46)
they're worth 99. (54:44 - 54:48)
i mean also the stories you have to tell (54:46 - 54:50)
yourself to make your purchases (54:48 - 54:52)
it's fine like you don't have to justify (54:50 - 54:54)
you don't have to convince us you just (54:52 - 54:57)
have to convince yourself (54:54 - 54:59)
that you've spent 500 (54:57 - 55:00)
on (54:59 - 55:02)
dust collectors (55:00 - 55:05)
and and to maybe get a thousand views on (55:02 - 55:08)
tick tock that other people will steal (55:05 - 55:09)
your (55:08 - 55:10)
we all have things that collect dust in (55:09 - 55:12)
the house yeah i see some plushes behind (55:10 - 55:16)
you i see an alola collection box (55:12 - 55:17)
understand (55:16 - 55:20)
in the sense of like (55:17 - 55:23)
having fun co-pops (55:20 - 55:26)
and what's a funko pop like 15 bucks (55:23 - 55:27)
yeah (55:26 - 55:30)
so having like six fun co-pops or having (55:27 - 55:32)
like one of these (55:30 - 55:34)
i would say one of these like they light (55:32 - 55:35)
up they're cool they're they're they're (55:34 - 55:38)
more interesting (55:35 - 55:39)
um (55:38 - 55:42)
and i i do think in the sense of pokemon (55:39 - 55:44)
items there's been so many plastic (55:42 - 55:46)
pokeballs over the last 25 years oh yeah (55:44 - 55:49)
i can grab one in the other room right (55:46 - 55:52)
now so having like a high quality metal (55:49 - 55:54)
pokeball that like lights up and that (55:52 - 55:57)
like senses your touch and stuff (55:54 - 55:59)
it's like i wouldn't ever tell somebody (55:57 - 56:00)
like oh get the whole set because that's (55:59 - 56:02)
ridiculous but if you're like trying to (56:00 - 56:04)
shop for a pokemon fan (56:02 - 56:06)
i would be like hey this is probably a (56:04 - 56:08)
really cool item that they might not buy (56:06 - 56:10)
themselves pokeball is the (56:08 - 56:12)
heal ball yeah give them that give them (56:10 - 56:14)
that dust no i just give everyone the (56:12 - 56:16)
premier ball that's the one to go no get (56:14 - 56:18)
luxury ball or go home (56:16 - 56:20)
here's the thing funko pops never (56:18 - 56:22)
collect dust because you'd never take (56:20 - 56:24)
them out of the box correct the box (56:22 - 56:26)
collect stuff just stack the boxes up (56:24 - 56:27)
against your wall you make a new wall (56:26 - 56:30)
you make a whole new funko room out of (56:27 - 56:32)
your funko box boxes and you sit in (56:30 - 56:35)
there and think about your choices (56:32 - 56:38)
i have a number of fine co-pops that i (56:35 - 56:42)
regret having in my home (56:38 - 56:42)
greg (56:42 - 56:45)
question of the week we're here (56:43 - 56:47)
we are how do we get here all right (56:45 - 56:49)
what's going on everybody's waiting for (56:47 - 56:51)
the question of the week because it's (56:49 - 56:55)
that time the podcast again (56:51 - 56:55)
i was not in the right channel like (57:03 - 57:09)
where did it go (57:05 - 57:09)
uh this is from james are there quality (57:16 - 57:20)
of life improvements you would like to (57:19 - 57:23)
see rolled back or changed for future (57:20 - 57:25)
generations for me candies solve some of (57:23 - 57:27)
the grinding issues and they were (57:25 - 57:29)
fantastic competitively however they (57:27 - 57:32)
made leveling slash levels arbitrary (57:29 - 57:34)
arbitrary (57:32 - 57:36)
so i when i saw this was there is not a (57:34 - 57:38)
single quality of life thing that i want (57:36 - 57:41)
undone (57:38 - 57:41)
there's one i would want on them (57:43 - 57:49)
which is just the friendship (57:46 - 57:52)
in battle thing (57:49 - 57:54)
i'll wear it like they can shake off (57:52 - 57:56)
illnesses or with stages yeah yeah yeah (57:54 - 57:59)
that would have i love that stuff (57:56 - 58:00)
there's not i can't think of a single (57:59 - 58:02)
quality of life that i'm like no get rid (58:00 - 58:06)
of it keep it all i want him 100 (58:02 - 58:10)
uh against the enforced experience chair (58:06 - 58:10)
what's that forest if you don't want (58:11 - 58:13)
things to get experienced put in your (58:12 - 58:15)
box stop stop with your (58:13 - 58:18)
rationalizations and breakifications (58:15 - 58:20)
friendship isn't forced either feed it (58:18 - 58:21)
bitter roots they'll stop being your (58:20 - 58:23)
friends real quick let them die a (58:21 - 58:24)
thousand times (58:23 - 58:26)
those are all i mean do i think a lot of (58:24 - 58:28)
things should be toggles (58:26 - 58:30)
absolutely (58:28 - 58:32)
do i do i want any of the quality of (58:30 - 58:34)
life improvements like if anything about (58:32 - 58:36)
brilliant diamond and shiny pearl taught (58:34 - 58:40)
me no i like those i like them i really (58:36 - 58:42)
enjoy having them around because going (58:40 - 58:46)
backwards is an awful experience (58:42 - 58:49)
um i don't know how well the bitterroot (58:46 - 58:51)
stuff works (58:49 - 58:53)
oh it it makes your your pokemon hate (58:51 - 58:54)
you it does you can only buy it at one (58:53 - 58:56)
place that's like the problem right you (58:54 - 58:58)
can only buy it at the (58:56 - 59:01)
at the bitterroot store yeah yeah (58:58 - 59:03)
but but also it takes money like that's (59:01 - 59:04)
the other problem is you'd have to have (59:03 - 59:07)
money to buy it to (59:04 - 59:10)
i mean if you're that committed (59:07 - 59:13)
you want your pokemon to hate you (59:10 - 59:14)
yes (59:13 - 59:16)
when the goal of the game is to bond (59:14 - 59:18)
with your pokemon then yeah you're gonna (59:16 - 59:21)
have to spend money to make your pokemon (59:18 - 59:25)
dislike easy cycle you grow berries sell (59:21 - 59:28)
the berries buy bitter roots in exchange (59:25 - 59:32)
for your sweet delicious berries (59:28 - 59:34)
it's called get your pokemon's hopes up (59:32 - 59:36)
that they're going to have something (59:34 - 59:38)
tasty and then give them something nasty (59:36 - 59:40)
instead (59:38 - 59:40)
yeah i'm trying to think of another (59:41 - 59:45)
quality of life improvement (59:43 - 59:47)
like like (59:45 - 59:49)
even the step back and breeding that (59:47 - 59:51)
this game took which really isn't it's (59:49 - 59:52)
just i (59:51 - 59:55)
don't have access to the to my history (59:52 - 59:57)
breeding (59:55 - 59:58)
from (59:57 - 60:01)
step zero again if it wasn't for the (59:58 - 60:04)
quality of life improvements that still (60:01 - 60:06)
exist would be (60:04 - 60:09)
it would be untenable it would (60:06 - 60:12)
it is barely acceptable the way it is (60:09 - 60:14)
plus i still have they confirmed that (60:12 - 60:17)
you can do the egg passing with two (60:14 - 60:18)
parents (60:17 - 60:20)
egg move i haven't seen it confirmed i (60:18 - 60:22)
believe i believe it works exactly like (60:20 - 60:24)
sword and shield yeah (60:22 - 60:25)
because i haven't seen a conversation (60:24 - 60:26)
people are saying we believe but i have (60:25 - 60:28)
not seen it confirmed i believe one (60:26 - 60:30)
person my twitch chat said they did it (60:28 - 60:31)
with uh (60:30 - 60:33)
whatever twitch also said they didn't (60:31 - 60:36)
time travel an animal that's true (60:33 - 60:38)
let's let's put a pin in what your (60:36 - 60:42)
twitch chat says (60:38 - 60:42)
i don't want atms to come back we're mad (60:42 - 60:46)
that they took away (60:44 - 60:48)
tm's being unlimited use they rolled (60:46 - 60:53)
back that that was an awful choice yeah (60:48 - 60:54)
no candy is awful (60:53 - 60:56)
no yeah (60:54 - 60:57)
the grind in this grinding levels in (60:56 - 61:01)
this game is bad it is frustrating to do (60:57 - 61:02)
especially since the experience seems to (61:01 - 61:05)
slow way down once you get past 50. (61:02 - 61:08)
like i cannot think of (61:05 - 61:11)
i mean i would agree that like (61:08 - 61:13)
candies you didn't have to use them you (61:11 - 61:14)
got them it doesn't mean you ever had to (61:13 - 61:17)
use them i i prefer to have quality of (61:14 - 61:19)
life improvements (61:17 - 61:21)
to be choices like let me turn that on (61:19 - 61:24)
or let me do pokemon to me or camping (61:21 - 61:26)
where i make friends with them that way (61:24 - 61:29)
like i i agree that there should be more (61:26 - 61:33)
choices to make but i don't want any of (61:29 - 61:35)
them rolled back because when i went (61:33 - 61:37)
back to play virtual console yellow i (61:35 - 61:40)
didn't finish the game because i (61:37 - 61:42)
couldn't i just couldn't deal with it (61:40 - 61:44)
anymore i'm like i can't (61:42 - 61:47)
they're so bad to play no they're not (61:44 - 61:49)
bad you just have to be in the mood for (61:47 - 61:51)
they have to be in the mood to do it the (61:49 - 61:53)
old (61:51 - 61:55)
to ignore how much better your life (61:53 - 61:58)
could be it's like when you go camping a (61:55 - 62:00)
thing that i hate you have to ignore (61:58 - 62:02)
that there's a much better way to do (62:00 - 62:04)
this and instead be like i'm gonna put a (62:02 - 62:08)
hot pan over fire that i made and get (62:04 - 62:10)
some berries from the woods or they (62:08 - 62:12)
could go to a restaurant and have a (62:10 - 62:15)
professional meal one of those gives you (62:12 - 62:17)
the satisfaction of the effort that you (62:15 - 62:19)
put towards (62:17 - 62:22)
being the the the champion and captain (62:19 - 62:23)
of your own life (62:22 - 62:24)
the restaurant (62:23 - 62:28)
no satisfaction in knocking out 40 (62:24 - 62:30)
gastrodons versus just using (62:28 - 62:35)
10 extra large candies i hate those (62:30 - 62:35)
i can't stand them they're ugly (62:37 - 62:42)
like i yeah i (62:40 - 62:44)
every quality and life improvement is (62:42 - 62:47)
literally has been an improvement (62:44 - 62:49)
and i don't want them to go i don't want (62:47 - 62:53)
them rolled back i just i it (62:49 - 62:55)
when i've been introduced to a better (62:53 - 62:57)
way i don't want to go back to the worst (62:55 - 62:58)
way (62:57 - 63:00)
like i hate the fact that tms are a (62:58 - 63:02)
thing again the one thing i could maybe (63:00 - 63:04)
think of is (63:02 - 63:05)
the (63:04 - 63:08)
the ease of planting berries in (63:05 - 63:10)
ultrasound ultramoon and sun and moon (63:08 - 63:13)
and there was like (63:10 - 63:15)
it was more tedious in x and y but x and (63:13 - 63:17)
y felt like you had more (63:15 - 63:19)
x and y had the best berry experience of (63:17 - 63:21)
any game no that was ultrasound (63:19 - 63:24)
you plant there was a single farm that (63:21 - 63:26)
you went to yeah and x and y and all (63:24 - 63:28)
your berries were there and you took (63:26 - 63:29)
care of them and you cross spread them (63:28 - 63:31)
and you fertilize them and it was a (63:29 - 63:33)
whole thing but you didn't have to go to (63:31 - 63:35)
different places no no i'm saying i i'm (63:33 - 63:39)
not i'm x and y is miles better than (63:35 - 63:41)
every other berry system (63:39 - 63:42)
but (63:41 - 63:44)
ultrasound ultra moon was like we're (63:42 - 63:45)
just going to simplify this and make it (63:44 - 63:48)
easy put 18 berries in we'll see in the (63:45 - 63:50)
morning and that was it yeah x and y you (63:48 - 63:52)
added like walk between and water and (63:50 - 63:54)
like put your fertilizer down yeah do a (63:52 - 63:57)
little berry work so very fast (63:54 - 63:58)
so i'm saying that i wouldn't mind if (63:57 - 64:01)
that came back if it was more advanced (63:58 - 64:03)
in what you can do so like you putting (64:01 - 64:06)
in the work got you more stuff in return (64:03 - 64:08)
versus the simplified (64:06 - 64:10)
nature of ultrasound ultramoon which is (64:08 - 64:11)
just pick (64:10 - 64:13)
18. (64:11 - 64:14)
go to bed (64:13 - 64:17)
like i like that it was very nice but if (64:14 - 64:18)
anything brilliant diamond shining pearl (64:17 - 64:21)
has taught me i don't want to fly to 800 (64:18 - 64:23)
locations i look i know it's on the map (64:21 - 64:24)
i can press the plus button i can see (64:23 - 64:27)
where it still means i have to fly there (64:24 - 64:29)
i have to pick i have to plant i have to (64:27 - 64:31)
water and only water's two at a time for (64:29 - 64:32)
whatever ungodly reason they decided to (64:31 - 64:34)
do that and then i gotta go to the next (64:32 - 64:36)
place at least in x and y it was all in (64:34 - 64:38)
the same place that was great that was (64:36 - 64:40)
cool pelico all in the same place that (64:38 - 64:43)
was that was great that was cool (64:40 - 64:45)
um (64:43 - 64:45)
i missed the x and y stuff (64:46 - 64:50)
but i also missed the ultrasound ultra (64:48 - 64:51)
moon stuff but i missed them for like (64:50 - 64:53)
different (64:51 - 64:56)
reasons also peligo was incredible the (64:53 - 64:59)
fact that pelogo is gone is is is (64:56 - 65:01)
heartbreaking (64:59 - 65:01)
quality of life put a spa next to that (65:05 - 65:10)
dumb daycare let me put like 10 eggs in (65:07 - 65:12)
the spa go to bed wake up in the morning (65:10 - 65:14)
now i can check 10 eggs that would be (65:12 - 65:15)
great (65:14 - 65:17)
shiny hunting that way the other problem (65:15 - 65:20)
with brilliant there are exactly two (65:17 - 65:22)
fire types in the over world and none of (65:20 - 65:23)
them (65:22 - 65:25)
have flame body (65:23 - 65:27)
doesn't it don't you need like hidden (65:25 - 65:28)
ability my cargo right (65:27 - 65:30)
you just need any mccargo (65:28 - 65:32)
both work (65:30 - 65:33)
which i had to go into the underground (65:32 - 65:35)
but it's good it's like okay if i wanted (65:33 - 65:36)
to hatch eggs i would have to find a (65:35 - 65:38)
ponyta and i don't think ponyta has (65:36 - 65:40)
flame body it might let me look at it no (65:38 - 65:41)
i don't think it does (65:40 - 65:43)
oh maybe it does i don't know (65:41 - 65:44)
i don't know i have a ponyta at my party (65:43 - 65:45)
right now (65:44 - 65:48)
let's add an egg and that egg still (65:45 - 65:49)
ain't hatched (65:48 - 65:51)
right away our flash fire its hidden (65:49 - 65:56)
ability is flame body which like again (65:51 - 65:56)
why why why why why brilliant damage i (65:57 - 66:02)
mean bro why (66:00 - 66:04)
uh well pokemon of the week (66:02 - 66:06)
wait i'm checking my did we go to (66:04 - 66:07)
youtube oh we didn't know our youtube (66:06 - 66:09)
money yeah (66:07 - 66:12)
my bad the big cash money youtube see (66:09 - 66:14)
youtube i am watching out for you (66:12 - 66:16)
and none of you appreciate me in the (66:14 - 66:19)
comments (66:16 - 66:19)
um (66:19 - 66:25)
where do i see his ability (66:22 - 66:25)
i see that oh flash fire (66:26 - 66:31)
uh troy said what is one thing that (66:34 - 66:38)
annoys you about (66:36 - 66:39)
what is one thing that knows you about (66:38 - 66:40)
brilliant dive and shutting pro that you (66:39 - 66:41)
can change i think we already talked (66:40 - 66:44)
about that this entire episode (66:41 - 66:44)
uh let's do cardboard they said what is (66:46 - 66:52)
your favorite elite four team (66:48 - 66:52)
elite four like which (66:52 - 66:56)
like (66:55 - 66:58)
the group of elite four or of an elite (66:56 - 67:01)
four members i think we can do both well (66:58 - 67:04)
there's well there's eight elite fours (67:01 - 67:04)
right (67:04 - 67:07)
so pick one of those and then they're (67:04 - 67:10)
paying attention to what's going on (67:07 - 67:12)
and move on (67:10 - 67:14)
but elite four doesn't count champion (67:12 - 67:16)
does it no the champion always changes (67:14 - 67:20)
yeah because i am the champion (67:16 - 67:20)
i would say favorite elite four member (67:22 - 67:27)
is probably for me kahili (67:24 - 67:31)
hmm is keely wait is that the golfer (67:27 - 67:33)
yeah yeah yeah i was thinking the same (67:31 - 67:34)
thing (67:33 - 67:35)
yeah yeah yeah (67:34 - 67:37)
yeah and if you play if you played the (67:35 - 67:39)
sun and moon demo they like talk about (67:37 - 67:41)
her a bunch yeah and then if you (67:39 - 67:42)
actually paid attention in that like (67:41 - 67:46)
rich hotel they like talk about her more (67:42 - 67:48)
um because like her parents own that (67:46 - 67:50)
golf course (67:48 - 67:51)
that's right behind it you can actually (67:50 - 67:53)
see a golf course back there if you like (67:51 - 67:55)
walk along the edge it's like kind of (67:53 - 67:57)
hard to see but you can see it (67:55 - 67:58)
um (67:57 - 68:01)
so i would say overall my favorite elite (67:58 - 68:02)
four (68:01 - 68:05)
group is the kalos elite four (68:02 - 68:08)
i love those peeps (68:05 - 68:12)
is that with marvel like yeah (68:08 - 68:12)
yeah and (68:12 - 68:16)
you could like pick which ones to go to (68:13 - 68:18)
i like that but if i want to go with a (68:16 - 68:20)
team that i would love to have (68:18 - 68:25)
i would probably go with (68:20 - 68:25)
caitlyn's in the running (68:25 - 68:28)
phoebe (68:28 - 68:33)
same ones i'm thinking of (68:30 - 68:34)
that kind of makes you think the lead (68:33 - 68:36)
fours are kind of weak (68:34 - 68:39)
like as a whole ah (68:36 - 68:41)
i would probably go with phoebe's i like (68:39 - 68:44)
phoebe's team a lot (68:41 - 68:44)
a couple of dusk girls couple bay (68:44 - 68:48)
nationals (68:46 - 68:52)
really the strongest elite four for me (68:48 - 68:56)
might be johto's elite four (68:52 - 68:56)
so you start with will (68:56 - 69:01)
will is forgettable except for masters (68:58 - 69:03)
and then you have (69:01 - 69:06)
koga recycled gym leader (69:03 - 69:08)

gen three engine four (69:16 - 69:21)

everybody cares about bertha bertha is (69:21 - 69:27)
agatha's cousin who cares about aaron (69:24 - 69:29)
the only reason you care about flint is (69:27 - 69:30)
because you realize that that dude (69:29 - 69:33)
doesn't know what fire type pokemon are (69:30 - 69:35)

all right pokemon of the week (70:13 - 70:17)
all right i (70:15 - 70:19)
have learned a lot about our listeners (70:17 - 70:21)
from this week's pokemon of the week um (70:19 - 70:23)
i think the important thing is number (70:21 - 70:25)
one they never listen to me when i say (70:23 - 70:28)
listen to every word uh and number two (70:25 - 70:30)
they're the kind of people where when (70:28 - 70:33)
their teacher said to them (70:30 - 70:34)
hey you didn't understand what i was (70:33 - 70:37)
saying they responded no you're just bad (70:34 - 70:39)
at teaching um (70:37 - 70:41)
i mean a lot of teachers were bad at (70:39 - 70:42)
teaching (70:41 - 70:43)
okay fine (70:42 - 70:47)
let me let me re re re do the last (70:43 - 70:49)
week's clue for everyone (70:47 - 70:52)
this pokemon which was the only one of (70:49 - 70:55)
its type introduced in johto that means (70:52 - 70:58)
that no other pokemon introduced in (70:55 - 71:01)
johto had the type that this pokemon has (70:58 - 71:04)
therefore dark there were multiple dark (71:01 - 71:07)
pokemon in johto wrong (71:04 - 71:10)
uh and whose evolution was not seen (71:07 - 71:12)
until sinnoh okay a lot of people (71:10 - 71:14)
figured out things that evolved in (71:12 - 71:16)
sinnoh but (71:14 - 71:17)
uh (71:16 - 71:20)
the two are independent clauses so i'm (71:17 - 71:21)
not (71:20 - 71:22)
whatever (71:21 - 71:24)
appears to have hair that either looks (71:22 - 71:26)
like a brush dipped in paint or frosted (71:24 - 71:28)
tips i i can't help you there kids but (71:26 - 71:29)
here's something (71:28 - 71:32)
look up frosted tips look some of you (71:29 - 71:34)
didn't grow up in the 80s so frosty tips (71:32 - 71:37)
might be lost on you just look it up i (71:34 - 71:39)
didn't write this last sentence because (71:37 - 71:41)
i like words (71:39 - 71:44)
it is equally likely to be male or (71:41 - 71:45)
female although there are no (71:44 - 71:47)
gender-based differences in its (71:45 - 71:48)
appearance (71:47 - 71:51)
that means hmm (71:48 - 71:54)
possibly what looks like it should be (71:51 - 71:57)
like roserade rosarate always looks like (71:54 - 72:01)
a girl sorry to say you know gender (71:57 - 72:04)
normative things it is more feminine (72:01 - 72:06)
presenting there you go that's the good (72:04 - 72:10)
way to put it but (72:06 - 72:13)
rosarite can be male or female (72:10 - 72:14)
so (72:13 - 72:17)
what other pokemon is more feminine (72:14 - 72:20)
presenting (72:17 - 72:21)
well this is an actual problem with (72:20 - 72:23)
gardevoir like people think that (72:21 - 72:26)
gardevoir is 100 female correct (72:23 - 72:28)
and gardevar is more feminine presenting (72:26 - 72:31)
more traditionally skirt wearing (72:28 - 72:34)
feminine ballerina presenting yes (72:31 - 72:36)
so therefore take all those pieces and (72:34 - 72:39)
put them together all right ready (72:36 - 72:40)
it's (72:39 - 72:43)
hoot hoot (72:40 - 72:43)
it's miss drivers (72:44 - 72:51)
drivers was the only ghost type pokemon (72:46 - 72:54)
introduced in johto (72:51 - 72:56)
i'm surprised ghost type (72:54 - 72:58)
they didn't do a ghost type gym leader (72:56 - 73:01)
in johto (72:58 - 73:01)
are you once again coming for cutie (73:06 - 73:11)
morty's throat he's because i will not (73:09 - 73:14)
tolerate your disrespect morty might be (73:11 - 73:16)
worst gym leader (73:14 - 73:19)
you're gonna say that when bugsie exists (73:16 - 73:21)
when falconer exists (73:19 - 73:24)
bugsy has bugsy has a haircross that's (73:21 - 73:24)
cool (73:24 - 73:27)
bugsy's got some weird stuff going on (73:24 - 73:31)
that's cool and fun he's an artist (73:27 - 73:33)
when berg exists well i can't i like (73:31 - 73:36)
berg a lot burke is all right and he has (73:33 - 73:37)
like rainbows in his gym and he's like (73:36 - 73:39)
that cool puzzle that's cool (73:37 - 73:43)
he's an artist and now he's cool (73:39 - 73:44)
morty's (73:43 - 73:45)
excellent (73:44 - 73:47)
oh wait miss revis i gotta pull this up (73:45 - 73:48)
yeah (73:47 - 73:51)
miss drivers has an excellent shiny (73:48 - 73:54)
you're wasting my precious magic (73:51 - 73:57)
internet not looking thing has a (73:54 - 73:58)
wonderful (73:57 - 74:01)
shuffle icon too (73:58 - 74:04)
and has limited trivia (74:01 - 74:06)
oh (74:04 - 74:08)
i probably used it up in saying that it (74:06 - 74:10)
was correct because one of them is (74:08 - 74:11)
the only ghost type pokemon introduced (74:10 - 74:15)
in generation two (74:11 - 74:15)
in pokemon coliseum miss dreyfus was the (74:18 - 74:24)
only ghost type pokemon that could be (74:22 - 74:25)
snagged (74:24 - 74:27)
what does this mean (74:25 - 74:29)
you know snagging it means (74:27 - 74:30)
stolen from the (74:29 - 74:32)
from the bad people who are mistreated (74:30 - 74:36)
[Music] (74:32 - 74:38)

evolution in gen 4 so got something (74:50 - 74:55)
going for it there you go (74:52 - 74:58)
it became a miss mages (74:55 - 75:00)

internet to sprinkle around to do (75:08 - 75:14)

be a total fail (75:14 - 75:19)
this rock ground or rock electric (75:16 - 75:22)
pokemon which is very popular in sinnoh (75:19 - 75:25)
can evolve when it reaches the level (75:22 - 75:28)
that is one-third of its evolutions (75:25 - 75:33)
regional and national pokedex number (75:28 - 75:33)
