[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 454th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host spj with me is greg hello i'm bringing the segment back tomorrow will actually be a nice day we're going to talk a little bit about the weather it's supposed to be 72 tomorrow i may open a window that is that is my weather update i well i accept that i have no i would really like to be out on my bike yeah well you can tomorrow and tomorrow only because then it drops again no uh yeah it's been raining pokemon up related but there's been nothing this is the worst 25th anniversary ever no do your pokemon thing dude uh will is here i i i got nothing but frustration and that nothing about frustration i got a sick pile of frustration to go lounge upon um we're here to talk about pokemon news or maybe the lack of pokemon news with them make our own pokemon news news they're gonna go off about that there are eggs in pokemon masters nobody cares oh that's it's porygon come on now you've probably how does porygon come from eggs if it's a digital look pokemon how does a fish evolve into an octopus these are questions we uh i think tamagotchi told us how poor guns come from eggs all right we do it we do have pokemon news and there is a bit of frustration that there's not a lot of pokemon news for it being the 25th i feel like the 20th was just better so far we were promised a year of music and we've had a post malone song music takes time the problem is they didn't hire nick nick is pumping out music he gets those jams out every week it's not like the 25th anniversary was a hidden hidden date it's not like it snuck up on them they created a website for it they needed to contact katy perry in at the end of the 20th anniversary and say you have five years to make a pokemon album go uh sure i will i will well let's start off with this pokemon news okay uh things added to the pokemon center this is our new segment because this is this is the thing they've been doing they just keep adding more stuff to pokemon center every week um there was something i wanted what was it so this last week we spent way too long talking about butter dishes and they're sold out we did not talk about it long enough greg we uh that's what i was gonna say controversial we are approaching mayonnaise levels of controversy around here no i we we literally cannot open up that jar i mean yes we can't we can't touch we can't touch that but we're getting there who went after you for saying it's not a topping and ignored the fact that i think butter should be abolished is hilarious that i will i will die on the hill of butter is not a condiment correct i like butter yeah enjoy it all you want you live in the land oh dairy wisconsin yeah clearly enough people liked butter or maybe enough people listen to this podcast because the butter dish is sold out now the the salt and pepper shake is gone i should have bought the butter dish when i had the chance and i didn't i don't really regret not getting it but i feel like now it's a collector's item i feel like i want it more than it sold out well you want things more when they're sold out or a rule that sounds about right yes scarcity is your attractor like i didn't care about the monster hunter collector's edition until i couldn't find it let's not get will started on that bit of business right there this is not a monster hunter podcast but boy oh boy have i got angers the frustrations celebration parade also sold out so don't know what the other ones look like but can't worry about that train nope it's all gone now the new things they added they didn't add a bunch of new stuff they added five new all over t-shirt prints um they added a gigantomax line of eevee snorlax toxtricity pikachu charizard they're 25 bucks they're all over prince which what does that mean what does an all-over print all over is like on the sleeves on the back the design goes wraps all the way around um they're polyester like they kind of seem like the same thing made out of like soccer jerseys yeah they look like jerseys also they did charizard kind of dirty with the face yeah his face is all cranked up i'm sorry the pikachu face if on the wrong body looks kind of like it's melting yes they're not they're okay i think the ev1 is the best if we're talking only looks yeah they're not great i mean they're like the ev1 oh that charizard one is some bad news yeah what a mistake it's yeah they i feel like they made different choices with the eevee one than they made anywhere else i feel like the ev1 was the last one they made after they figured out how to do it they were like oh okay we got it because like charizard wraps around and the face is not on the back the tail is and like you get a weird side view of pikachu on the back and toxicity is all over the place and then yeah how do they mess up pikachu why is it too pikachu like the pikachu it should just be pikachu's back and butt yeah but for evie they said okay we'll do a face on the front and the face in the back yeah which is also kind of weird and also snorlax apparently lives in your armpit it's it's they added uh two play mats as well um and then they added the tcg deck box the tcg sleeves uh i picked up the deck box i'm a sucker for duck boxes their deck boxes are normally pretty nice uh and they have like magnets in them do you have a deck that you're putting into said deck box no but i have enough cards that i can just put garbage cards into the deck box and then they're held for like five years and then i open it and i go oh these cards and then i put them back why why are you keeping garbage cards i don't know because it feels weird to throw them away or no one wants them well well at one point once you get enough garbage cards then you sell them to like troll and toad or cool stuff and then you get like 20 bucks don't you have like a local place that you can say i want to unload my commons no i did go to a local place okay let's get into tcg minute no are we done you didn't no no we're we'll come back the tcg minute also part of pokemon center okay okay okay okay because they pokemon center also put up battle style booster packs and i took a screenshot of this because i'm assuming they're gonna pull it down one day they put up pokemon tcg sword and shield battle style sleeved booster packs 10 cards 3.99 that's the normal price of a booster pack four bucks true when they say sleeved it's just the ones you see on shelves at like target it's the the cardboard sleeves sleeving yes um they sold out in about 10 minutes which i once again frustrated and angry because i was told by a certain twitch streamer slash podcast host that this set would not sell out because there's no charizard and there's no pikachu there was someone at target that bought 40 boxes or cases or whatever in one fell swoop that's true explain yourself okay i will i will explain i will explain myself in one easy sentence for this pokemon center listing now this is pokemoncenter.com the official pokemon website and i want to remind everyone that like three weeks ago we read a tweet by play pokemon an official one of the many official pokemon twitter and they said we're really sorry about the tcg issues we're working to make more cards and get them in your hands and this is what it says on their listing for the 10 booster pack or the the booster pack 10 cards official listing final sale item choose your battle style wisely purchase limit of 72. well 72 packs it's like two boxes worth what how do you let how you if anyone knows about that maybe they don't know i don't did look according to the pokemon company doesn't have the internet we are in a tcg drought and they're saying the purchase limit is 72. that's only two boxes worth that's not that much why is it not 10 well it's like i go to barnes noble i go to barnes noble and they have the tcg cards locked behind the counter in the front area and they have a bunch of booster packs and it's limit two and you're like i don't want to wait in a 45 minute line in a pandemic at a barnes and noble to buy two booster it's not worth my time but it would have been worth your time to buy 72 right off the internet yes off the internet from the official pokemon go or 280 plus tax man that is more than two boxes would it cost you just to buy yeah well like i feel like maybe purchase limit six purchase limit 10 72 though but maybe they know that they're the company and they can just make more but yeah they should have a print to sell like pipeline i mean that is under their control they they now control the market you buy 72 here and then when it's sold out they're like a haha we'll we'll print more and put it on our website unless maybe they were like this is the same website that i was looking at sitting cuties and i was like ah sweet check out this bad monetrix sitting cutie and then it's like you're clicking too fast banned you're a bot can't be here anymore it's like well now i'm banned from pokemon center for 48 hours because i was just trying to check out the zigzagoon butt on on pokemon center i i just look 70 okay so they made a choice you don't have to agree with it oh i don't i don't they definitely made a choice to make 287 off of a bunch of customers a bunch they probably sold it to like four different people and they were like we're done we're done we're out we did it we only had 500 in stock they did say they were going to make more available yes yeah did they not make more available it's out of stock right now i can't get one so so 72 people could have gotten it one person instead got 72 people's worth done and dusted um so i haven't gone to target in the past week but prior to so we did a charity event for for wwf not the wrestling company wildlife wrestling federation is what i said i thought every time i saw it um we raised six thousand dollars in a weekend for wwe tcg cards yeah and i originally got a booster box from cool stuff inc i pre-ordered it back in january it was 120. um i decided to donate the booster box to the charity cause so if somebody donated money i would just mail them a boo i opened the booster pack mail them to the booster pack they didn't have to pay for shipping none of the money went to the booster pack 100 went to charity and then my friend danny phantom who runs a tcg store i used to like that tv show that was a good one that was a very good show uh he donated a booster box to the cause so shout out to danny and so we had two booster boxes um but with that being said we oversold because tiltify like broke for a second so we only had 72 boosters but we sold 80 something oh who's the pokemon center now um and uh i did see because i went to my local game store board game barrister and i was like oh i'm you know i haven't bought penny sleeves in a long time but i need penny sleeves and i need like the top loaders and they don't sell top loaders at target i mean they sell like pokemon they sell like binders and sleeves but i need top loaders to ship and they had all that stuff i was like super surprised they had penny sleeves actually had a penny so it was a hundred sleeves for a dollar and then they had um they had top loaders but i found top loaders in my house but they had a bunch of battle styles behind the counter and i was like oh cool like you guys the etbs are up there and the the lunch boxes up there and they had multiple booster boxes up there and i was like oh maybe i'll i'll pick up some i was like just a odd question how much is your etb and they were like oh 75 dollars and i was like well i mean you get that coin an etb is normally forty dollars correct eight booster packs if you do eight times four that's thirty six dollars so you're paying an extra four dollars for like the box and the sleeves and the coins um and the energy cards you get the energy cards you do get uh you do get the energy cards and then i was like oh how much is uh gosh how much is a booster box so booster box msrp is 149 or whatever um which is four dollars a pack and they were like oh it's 169 and i was like uh that's not as bad as as bad but she's 170 it's so weird because like a year ago you're paying a hundred dollars for a booster box you're getting 36 packs and now it's like oh you're paying 70 extra dollars for the same amount of cards because of demand but they had it they they had battle styles in stock the barnes noble had battle styles in stock uh i've heard from people in our slack that they've found battle styles at target it's it's been easier to find just not as um yeah just not as easy it's easier to find did you buy the box or not no i didn't buy them yeah the last time i was at target they did not have any any pokemon they only had the bad magic sets i wonder if the target the time forgot has stuff though where's that one uh you know where the micro center is yes there's a target over there that's literally only accessible through crypt like a weird maze and it's by the senior center and nobody goes there whenever i'm looking for something that has sold out i will go to the target the time forgot and they almost always have it wow i'm i'm heading there after we finish recording i got stuff to buy um i don't know so go back to the pokemon center.com i like the tcg boxes just because they're like i think they're more collectible than play mats playmats are just like uh where you're gonna put it you only have so much surface area in your house you roll it up oh yeah i got a stack of like 30 play mats in my closet right a bunch of play mats the sleeve the sleeves like the tcg sleeves will eventually just fall apart yep um true and i already have 400 different sleeves from all the etbs i've purchased in the last like six years so i definitely don't need sleeves so i feel like the deck boxes are like a good they're 12.99 it's like a good simple collectible eventually if i decide to play irl i have them i guess yeah i legit haven't opened the deck box i bought at worlds it's still in the plastic that one too that's the uh i have the nashville one as well though playing the little banjo yeah i like those uh the other thing that added to pokemon center before we move off this topic is they added uh they partnered with moleskin and they added did they change the price wait what the heck what do you mean they legit change the price oh i got an easy what are you talking about okay so they added two moleskin notebooks yeah and i bought the smaller one and it is which cover art did you get yeah the smaller one is the all yellow one mostly yellow one yeah and it's 22.99 and i only paid 14.99 for it it increased the price by seven dollars sounds about right it's got a pikachu on it with some flowers it looks very french and then the bigger one is now 33 dollars and it was 25 man oh it's got a mimikyu i like it it also has a yamper butt on it yeah it does here's the thing i always think oh i'm going to get this notebook and i'll use it and then i never yeah that's not what i do yeah oh i do a heck ton of notebooks i'm all right i use college ruled 1.99 notebooks from target every time well maybe if you spent 22.99 on a fancy notebook you'll feel compelled absolutely with your fountain pens i feel like i have nothing fancy to put into a fancy notebook and therefore i never use them because putting like d stats into a fancy notebook feels weird yeah i agree writing down i mean it feels weird until you do it enough times [Laughter] and then this is kind of like normal i mean i bought that i bought a moleskine notebook literally to to put free form notes so that i could perform a wedding and i still haven't used the actual notebook itself because i printed out pages and just shoved them in so that i wouldn't ruin the notebook ruin the notebook ruin the device that was specifically made for writing in i feel like i have better thoughts to put into a fancy notebook i feel like greg you would be all about the moleskine i'm all about buying them and then i can't you bring myself to use that what i've always like moleskin is like the the ferrari of notebooks right like heck no toyota corolla ferrari ferrari of which decade because that that brand really changes value from the 70s moving past like in the 70s you're talking about ferrari being the greatest thing in the world nowadays does anybody talk about is there even a 2020 yes ferrari oh they still make ferraris don't you worry yes does it look like a shoe the problem greg is that we don't chase cars anymore because it's like shameful you're not driving a fully electric vehicle shame on you right so you can't brag about my beautiful ferrari that you guys i don't talk to you guys i don't show you because you're all gonna be like look at you earth killer yeah with your gas guzzling hyper drive wait what's up what's a better notebook than a moleskin wait we don't know because we can't afford them oh they're better nails better notebooks than most i mean the fact that i can go to m street in dc to the moleskine store and buy a moleskine and walk out of it at that store for under a hundred dollars means it ain't fancy i mean how how fancy you're gonna make paper dude what are you what do you realize you have not used enough paper to know the differences between paper oh i went to graphic design school i know the differences of paper but yeah on a tablet and a wish you've only ever done things in the virtual world you kids you never had to put it in a typewriter and know what weight paper was i know wait you're bleeding now you gotta get that organic single source paper from the forests of untouched unpolluted nepal where it's washed in the tears of the buddhist nuns in their their peace and weeping for the world that's where you get your paper from that is where you get the elegance of writing right there your inks can only be sourced from the finest non-pokemon beetles uh well i'll i'll let you know when my uh 15 notebook arrives compared to the now 22 dollar price notebook but this was the second time they they messed up it recently because they put those lanyards on those lanyards were like 30 bucks yeah and then like a couple days later they changed it to 12.99 hopefully they refunded people but this isn't the first time pokemon and moleskine have have done a collaboration because when i was at pax east in 2019 there was a little moleskine vendor in the shopping mall like a little kiosk and they had a bunch of pokemon yeah yeah i think teens that looked better than this uh mimosa pokemon i feel like if you have a mall kiosk you can't call your brand fancy yes correct true there you go or if you're featured in a mall i don't think it was a moleskine mall kiosk i think it was a fancy notebook they had the inventory and they had moleskines yes we have anything else on pokemon center uh i'm looking i'm looking at then these new releases that are sure to disappoint oh is the magikarp tank back in yet no the saving cuties seem pretty sold out as well do you think they're going to restock that thing a tank yeah maybe yeah i feel like shirts are easy to make comfy to wear i mean i need to get i need to get in shapes so i can wear said magikarp shirt to the gym and i kind of like that it says doing just fine on it doing just fine not great just fine just fine doing just fine don't worry about it uh this is off pokemon.com hatch clefa igly buff and porygon during the pokemon masters ex egg event march 24th to april 7th um you'll have a chance increased chance of getting eggs from battle um they'll hatch fairy or normal type pokemon uh making their day they the debut in eggs are clefa igle buff and porygon so all three are brand new there's a chance you can hatch a shiny clefa shiny igloo buff shiny poor gun too if that's not enough incentive to hatch lots of eggs greg you'll find that sink pairs you face off against during the egg event will be weak to fairy and normal type except we all got xerneas so i don't know why i need a poor substitute in a hatched egg that i have to try to raise up did you just say weak to normal type uh that's what it says yes this doesn't exist this doesn't this is not our universe there is nothing that is weak to normal type don't think about it because there's nothing that is normal things on the island run a bit differently than you would predict so is this uh passio is that the casio yeah remind me not to visit there uh i can't even remember um isn't like most pokemon or like all pokemon masters they're only weak to one thing right yeah they're only weak to one thing so like if you're if you're fighting a vile plume yeah vileplume will only be weak to like fire even though technically violent would be weak to like flying psychic as well or psychic yeah but only fire would do super effectively and sometimes the thing they choose you're like huh okay sure there's one that's four times that you would assume the four times weak thing is the one they'd picked but they didn't so okay i mean they got to keep the game balanced obviously yeah i mean that's why they put support got an eggs look i i i don't mind hatching eggs i i don't mind it i just don't see the point like nothing great comes out of them i actually have to go out of my way to hunt for eggs when i can just use my ten in a day to get my thousand coins on the iris thing to do my random pull it reminds me of purified pokemon and go like they just don't know what to do with it and they're like scared to make any major changes i mean you purify your pokemon because you want to make sure that their hearts are clear and that you're you're that they're your friend and leaving them as a shadow pokemon is actually causing them physical and emotional harm so if you leave your shadow pokemon a shadow pokemon and pokemon go understand that you are the monster of pocket monsters yes okay that's fine with me yeah because much like an unopened pack of pokemon trading card game cards a shiny unpurified monster in pokemon go is worth so much more it's worth nothing [Laughter] nothing and people will look at it and go oh you don't care about people it is a future investment i also take my shopping cart and just put it in the parking spot next to where i parked my car and leave it there and drive away yes that is me i am the darkest of evils you are dark and evil it should not be allowed to continue your existence cart i actually go around the parking lot and i get one shopping cart and put it in each empty space i can find this is how i derive pleasure in life did i ever tell you about the uh the paragraphs long complaint people had that my local target built a row of electric car charging stations at le they're literally the furthest parking spot away from the entrance they are the last row and there was pages days long complaints that they are wasting parking spaces the spaces that nobody parks in that are never full to convert them to electrical charging stations people were outraged so go fill those up with carts i mean i do that too they're never used ever um the anthem comes out in a couple days i've been saving my coins give me because i have not pulled on any banners and i'm finally up to 12 000 coins to pull to get the best champion in existence diana she had her opportunity to stop lysander and she didn't she had a career look he's not gonna have a career when he knows what blows up the world exactly everybody knows that it was sycamore's job to take care of his boyfriend and he didn't do it really he didn't he he even admits after that whole thing and you go to the other town he's like yeah my bad i should have taken care of my boyfriend but i did i was too busy trying to unbutton the top part of my shirt uh so thanks for taking care of my of my dirty laundry for me oh did he almost destroy the world whoops let's have a battle i'll give you a pokemon format doesn't uh didn't lysander make the uh facetime in that game yes uh the holocaust yeah yeah yes yeah yeah he did yeah he did one good thing as i on one of the past few nights they've all grown into a blur watched the complete pokemon generation series every single cartoon in order wow from the first one to the last uh missing one of the x and y ones was featuring how lasander made the hollow caster i realized i never finished the alola series because i have famous journeys now yeah in the anime and they reference things that happened in alola and that's how i remembered like oh i never saw the end of that none of this makes sense um i don't know where i left off in journeys oh i remember there's like an episode with milotech and phi bass and i was like i'm so mad i watch this episode because it was all filler it happened yeah there's a lot of filler the weird thing that you've done with this series is sometimes they do two 15-minute episodes like they admit we did i'm cool with that that's fine like the man the milotic one should have been 15 minutes the most recent one of team rocket where they actually reference team rocket being aware that they're stuck in only a 15-minute episode is actually quite funny but it's strange cause i'm like you know when i was a young adult i used to have to sit through 30 minutes of this garbage not 15 minutes when you were a young adult this didn't even come out until you were 26. you're an adult adult that's a young adult comparison to where i am now there there's only been like maybe three filler episodes in 20 some episodes i've seen but the my problem with the milotic episode is they've just done it before it's just like girl is made fo like my like everyone thinks feedback is a garbage pokemon they're not wrong and then like it evolves and then everyone's like oh my gosh this is the most beautiful pokemon ever you you worked hard to make this happen yes the story that they've literally been telling since the ugly duckling a tried and true fairy tale they told it again wait till you hear that romeo and juliet was copied into west side story amongst many other other other shows it's just shocking they took an entire episode to be like look guess the feedback is going to evolve if if if you don't see the growth did they even grow yeah i think journeys is awesome i just think that's actually really good except for the fact that it makes the world feel really super weirdly small i think they don't they don't they don't they don't they just lean into harder in the most recent section i'm like all right it's fine i mean we know they have wormholes in the pokemon universe so i mean to be fair in the game you can fly from one place to the other instantly you don't know if it's instant or not they just you don't see the passage of time speaking of the passage of time let's take a break and that's a good transition i think wow and uh we will be back to talk about uh some pokemon go stuff and some players cup and some sword and shield and we will be right back dance dance abundance abundance dance [Music] abundance [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so we are back from our break uh and because the pokemon company loves to announce everything last minute players cup four it's been announced i love some friends who are trying to get in on this one so they're they're something's working uh okay quick quick is there a t-shirt is there a ball is there there's no ball guy there's no i'm gonna play my phone during this whole segment so okay so pokemon players cup 4 begins in april uh and it includes the tcg and the video games uh get the info you need to participate and uh in and watch the pokemon tcg sword and shield pokken dx tournaments online tournament is approaching trainer i'm just off pokemon.com this exciting competition will take place through april through july and it will see some of the best pokemon trainers around the world to square off to win a share of 45 000 in prizes and for cash money cash money they said 45 000 in prizes because that could be like a washing machine [Music] there you go you get battle styles boost your bags and not only this though let me reread the sentence trainers around the world will square off to win 45 000 in prizes and perhaps more importantly greg and will bragging bragging rights one of the top pokemon players in the world participation will open to all master division players and the tournament will be entirely online there will be three separate competitions one will feature the pokemon trading card game one will feature pokemon sword and shield one will feature pokken tournament dx while they're still supporting that one uh eligible competitors can earn their places uh in the region qualifiers through qualifying events to participate you must in all caps m-u-s-t have a trainer club account and a player id before the first phase of the tournament tcg players will need to be logged into tcg online with a player id attached to their players their ptc account between january 16th to april 16th to participate sword and shield players will battle in the qualifier to lock in a spot video game players need to link their player cup account um pokken players the three of you that are listening all players must require to register online before the date and they need both a discord and a battlefly account to participate i've never heard of battlefly battlefly is what the players cup has been running through already it's just like a laddering system and other games use it too like league of legends and fortnite and stuff it's it's pretty well supported but yeah players cup three we haven't even seen who wins i think they're still like doing the top i think they got down to top 16 for each region but we don't have any we don't that tournament's not over but this the qualifying stuff for this is in like two weeks so and it is even though we're going back to series seven for vgc stuff which is like no legends this will be series eight so it'll still be your one legend probably they're going to be zashi and or groudon or kyogre or evital iveltal however you say that one evil tall groupon kroger kroger uh are they gonna do like the whole like we ban the top 10 that were used in the previous tournament that kind of thing or is it just no legends or only one legend or blah blah blah it is just the same rule set as before the legend rule set no bands or anything did i not sh maybe i i maybe they've always wanted to do money maybe it was like legally hard to do in the past and they got to it or maybe so i feel like there's like maybe two reasons they wanted to do it all along but it took a while to get to this point and or maybe participation wasn't as good as they wanted it to be and players go up three so they decided to add money to have more people participate a combination of the two are you planning on participating yeah uh i don't love series eight i don't love the zashian kroger meta that exists but i mean it's a weekend of you know doing matches so it's it's pretty low a bar of entry but you enjoy playing pokemon vgc uh yeah that was not the qualified yes that was like a ring endorsement here and what we get was uh if i have to i was i i was super bummed i didn't qualify for players cup three because literally if i would have won one extra match i would have been good and i messed up and that was my bad it's for me it's it's it's funny because i i've had coaching for vgc and my coach is always like i don't know how you can stream and competitively battle at the same time lack of focus thing you mean yeah no i'm very focused but it's still very nerve-wracking with your chat i don't think you're that focused i mean to be fair i've been on those streams when he's actually focusing and he does not interact with chat they are an in-between match distraction because everything is on time delay and you can't actually see what he's doing because he's covered up in case there's snipers and he's got this look on his face what do i do here what's the play here what do i do here why are you recreating my stream right now people have that you're setting expectations you know if it's not the same weekend i'd be willing to uh take a crack at the tcg stuff because there is a cramer ant deck what does cameron do is it v max cramer and v max there there is a cramaran and a cremerant v um so the deck so kramer is a colorless pokemon i mean that's appropriate birds flying flying type is colorless yes because remember greg all the birds used to be normal flying so that that fighting would have half a chance so uh kramer ant has a three colorless move called spit shot and you discard all the energy from this pokemon and this attack does 160 damage to any one of your opponent's pokemon so you can active something on the bench yeah nice and then the v-max is uh three colorless max jet flip a coin for uh each energy attached to this pokemon this attack does 80 damage for each heads so you can do one small 80 160 240. not the greatest move but the reason you play cramerant is because there's a porygon z and porygon z's ability is you can attach any amount of colorless energy to any of your pokemon in any way you want so there's so you don't play any normal energy you just play all different like the recycle energy the special energies you play all different special energies and then the porygon lets you attach them all so it's pretty cool and i think it won a korean tournament uh recently it could happen but i like playing with i think will feels the same way i like playing decks with pokemon you actually enjoy using or you like i mean i did have a victini deck that was literally for victini and a couple of energies and a bunch of junk so yes you are correct um and this deck this deck uh fits my although like the dominant deck is adp like i think out of that korean tournament if you looked at the top 16 i'm pretty sure 11 of the 16 were adp can you put adp in your camera rant deck uh some adp's run one cramarat because they run they want that they want that snipe shot because i think de dene um gx is exactly 160. yeah anything that can do direct damage to the bench is worth looking at definitely um anyways players cup is coming uh we'll see how active people are for that okay we have um last bit of sword shield news already over by the time this podcast comes up they did a floral event uh this is their first event what was the last event was pikachu for 25 um maybe i don't i think no it wasn't they did the cramer ant event they did the pikachu event i'm trying to think of all the events they did this year alone they did pikachu they did cram they did this one so this one was uh didn't they do a machamp one no this was um shiny liliganth in max raid battles for friday night saturday and then sunday nothing too special here i guess the difference is the little gamp was easier to find i guess it was liligant and the other one uh mantis uh florence romantis laureatis lorantas the last event was okay so i have it here february 26-28 was shiny pikachu the problem with the pikachu event was it was a hundred percent all five so i'm just gonna explain how this works because there are some people who are new to the show maybe and every time i do this for stream people are like what's happening what's going on how do you find these just gonna sum it up so they do these events over the weekend they give us zero heads up they turn one pokemon shiny and they give it a certain percentage um that's how the game works so in in the pikachu event last time all five star pikachus all five star raids promoted could be pikachu but there was a two percent chance for pikachu but a hundred percent of the five stars were pikachu which means two divided by um a hundred is one out of fifty so your odds were one out of fifty in this case it was um all five star rates could either be little against vileplume cherum lorentis and comfey but because laurentis was sorry because liliganth was the only one that was the shiny liligant was a 22 percent chance to spawn in five star raids the shiny little against was a two percent so two divided by 22 is 1 in 11. so there's a huge difference between i have a 1 in 11 chance of finding shiny oligarch first i have a 1 in 50 chance of finding shiny pikachu so it was a little bit easier to get a shiny little again this time around but i didn't very few people appreciate the beauty that is little again and pedaling this is a great pokemon it is a fantastic pokemon it's uh very good so and then i think the one before the pikachu was kramer i'm almost positive yes yeah no it wasn't it was a mystery and then it was cramer i forgot about the mystery one yeah which i think i only got one from that one i got one from that one i got no little gant but here's the thing i had to spend like find it my own and then find it shiny to guarantee that i could get a luxury ball and if i was in somebody else's it wasn't guaranteed and at that point i'm just gonna breed a little can shiny in the ball that i want with moves that i want yeah like i feel like the ones where it's something that i can breed myself i tend not to be so oh i'm gonna spend the weekend trying to find one yeah it's really unless it's in my own game i'm not going to get it in the ball that i want uh so i think i did it on friday with y'all like i was on friday night and then my uh switch battery was like i need and then charging happened on screen you got the shiny one i did yeah i got the shiny one i feel like uh sword shield's a little getting a little long in the tooth now it is it really is so like this event was like oh cool like i have something to i have a target to go to right yeah um i mean i played i played with it for a while like right now i'm still breeding for my shiny solo so that i can move all my rejects into home so that i can trade all my rejected solosis for the shiny rosalia that everybody solosis solosis solo no yes it's not a cereal it is it could be it should be a great cereal so i'm still doing that but i don't know i feel like i'm at the point where i think do i want to restart a game of sword and shield like do i want to play through it again because i feel like this is where my third game itch comes in that the one has been out for so long and now i'm like i do want to play from the beginning but i would like it to be slightly different and i guess the two dlcs would be slightly different if i've already played them i don't know yeah i'm feeling is feeling it's feeling like i want to remake a lot sooner than we're gonna get the rebate uh since i'm not that excited over snap although i did watch a preview video of snap and i'm a little bit more sold on it what's getting you in uh so they mentioned like even on the first on the first map there were two possible branching uh paths so uh that at least adds feels like there's replayability the night day cycle uh seemed to have a little bit more playability there like things more things to do it just felt like from that preview they seem to have more things to do than the original snap um well the original snaps like a 45 minute game correct uh so i i'm a little bit more sold on it but i'm still probably just gonna watch somebody play it for a while and see if that's yeah what i wanted yeah will steve be streaming snap on the stream yes yeah okay then that's enough snap for me right there i mean the the the dilemma i have is like probably want to start it during the day and try to play through as fast as possible so when it gets to the evening then you play through at night and then you see everything that changes or you set your clock so that it transitions from day to night in the middle of your streaming that's true get the best of both worlds well we don't know what if the day or night cycle is going to be real time right like we don't know i'm sure it'll just be the switch's clock well don't be so sure it could be like you go on different missions that are different times of the day i mean oh oh i see you so you could just switch day and night yeah i didn't think about that i'm sure we'll get uh one more trailer and probably another info drop i mean the game's a month away now so i'm sure we'll get one more final push of like hey and yet this has been a no news 25th anniversary i'm on their 25 website right now and it hasn't changed it just says exciting announcements speaking of websites that change pokemon go live snivy community today in april announced sunday april 11th from uh do they know this is on wrestlemania weekend april 11th from 11 to 5. you get three times the catch stardust uh snivy will have frenzy plant the mossy one-time purchase of the scam box for the star pieces and the mossy lure and the elite charge one dollar will get you the special research i think people are happy people like starters true love snivy snivy is cool i've never assumed maybe later this year would then be tepig and oshawa maybe not so close since they're still spacing it out i am still comic-con just announced that they're doing comic-con this year uh which is wild to me what how what they're doing it in november they're doing it over thanksgiving how how did they make that con even worse by putting it on a holiday like you already take literally what i've seen like the like the experience i hate the most which is sitting in line to go to a panel and then you're putting it over a holiday weekend maybe the 200 iq play is preventing these people from spending money at target because they'll spend it all with like mom and pop shops that already charge way too much for the products they bring to a convention valid uh snivy so with with with a better community today i think everyone would agree there has been you know complaints that we've got these you know people complaining about rosalia being recycled which was the best community today and they will hear nothing else sure i'm not disagreeing with you i'm just the other shoe over here what what is the other shoe that is an expression i'm just um yeah i'm just big the other shoe no stop is this from waiting for the other shoe to drop or the shoe is on the other foot which one were you going for walk a mile in somebody else's shoes whichever one fits the best for the analogy no you can't do that so yes i am the other shoe some people were very upset that you know community days have been a bit lackluster but i was in the position of we'll make a blackluster because we can't leave our houses rosalia day was the best community today we had quite a good time doing that incredibly great time with one of the best pokemon out there save the good community days for when it gets nicer and things are a little bit safer outside and so we got styvy i still think any any time now niantic's gonna be like we're doing it here's here's our event schedule um for the year oh yeah oh no no no no no no no no no no no why would they do that what is the benefit of you getting no more than two months no early notice before anything no benefit after this last year of them posting a schedule and then having to break those dates not not a whole schedule but like he's looking forward to pokemon go fast this way we're doing irl events again oh they can't make that call they're not comic-con they don't have lawyer money when everybody waiting in line to go see thor comes home and sues them because they're they don't need lawyer money they just need texas to be like yes of course pick eddie pick all the parks we don't care it's always like yes which is a whole nother thing let's not rag on my future home please it is not your future home i deny that reality you can deny it all you want someday i will be a texan no you will never be a texan not with that attitude no exactly that is the attitude that i am keeping speaking of niantic some non-pokemon go news i feel like we have to talk about this even though it's not pokemon related because niantic is so big niantic and nintendo are teaming up to create a mobile application featuring pikmin uh this is off nintendo dot co dot jp um the first in a series of apps the two companies will develop together i feel like a lot of people miss this point uh the title is so i'm assuming they signed a contract to make multiple games together uh the title is designed to make walking more fun ar technology company niantic headquarters in san francisco ceo john hanke and nintendo headquarters in kyoto uh president uh furuyu kawa firakwa i said that wrong sorry spelled f-u-r-u-k-a-w-a furukawa yeah furukawa that was way better than i did they are partnering together to jointly develop apps with an s that combined diantics real world ar technology with nintendo's beloved characters the first title the two companies are developing are based on the pikmin franchise with gameplay and activities designed to encourage walking and making that activity more enjoyable there's nothing enjoyable about walking would you say i love walking the the app is scheduled to launch later in 2021 niantic is the publisher the title will be the first title created by niantic's tokyo studio niantic developed this studio in april of 2018. i did not know niantic out of tokyo studio they snuck it in there did anybody tell japan they still don't know they apparently didn't i i haven't you know i saw this news all week i didn't see anyone talk about like this is game number one they're making and there will be more games uh i think ever though the whole narrative was like pikmin go i mean i guess i've never played pikmin so i'm not certain what that functionality is oh okay let me just finish the press release and i can tell you what you do this is a quote as we continue to expand our game portfolio it was a natural step to team up with nintendo said john hanke ceo of niantic we are looking forward to shaping the future ar together bringing nintendo's beloved characters to life for a mobile game for players around the world niantic's ar technology had made it possible for experience the world as if pikmin are secretly living around us said miyamoto the resident representative director fellow nintendo based on the theme of making walking fun our mission is to provide people a new experience that is different from traditional games that's what nintendo always says we hope that pikmin and this app will become a partner in your life and the other thing i will mention is a developer working on the game tweeted that they are they've been working on this for a long time they're very excited and they specifically said in their tweet this is nothing like pokemon go so wow [Music] 100 true okay so pikmin there's three of the games pikmin 1 pikmin 2 pikmin 3. pikmin 3 came out on wii u no one bought it or played it that is not true then they remade it for the switch that is still pikmin 3. miyamoto did say that they're working on pikmin 4 for whatever that's worth uh pikmin are these little creatures that flower creatures you the the general story of the game is the same your your spaceship crashes on a pikmin world it broke breaks apart and then you befriend the pikmin and then the pikmin help bring your ship parts back together and then fight boss monsters right usually monsters are protecting ship parts and then you build your ship and then you save you cry because you're leaving the pikmin and then you fly away that's the whole game that doesn't have a lot of replayability um no not really because it's like a puzzle game right like yeah uh how do i get this duracell battery it's actually a duracell battery you know it's like a lemmings thing you know your people are somewhat expendable that's that's kind of like where i i have been confused because i thought it was like lemmings and boy oh boy was i a huge lemmings fanboy when that game was available yeah it's got a lemmings quality to it although uh to be fair lemmings don't do that that was disney literally driving them off a cliff for film footage livingston oh that was yes just fyi fact or fiction but we were talking about the video the game fleming's no relationship to real lemmings there are probably at least two ways to get your items um but most of it is just like i'm just gonna throw six pikmin at this battery and then they're gonna carry the battery back and that's it yep and there there might be a different way to get the battery but i'm like why would you just not do the basic of like i'm just gonna throw these over and there we go so i would yeah they're cute i don't i'm sure they're there's a hardcore pikmin fan listening being like no there's a million different ways i'm sure there is probably unlock the easter eggs that get you the mega spaceship i love the pikmin series i played all of them i think they're great i played one and two i didn't play three uh so i'm excited for this i i mean instead of like instead of catching pikmin you're just going to walk across and pluck them out of the ground and then stops are going to be parts that you have to pick up and throw hey hey hey this is nothing like pokemon go pokemon go just like ingress is nothing like pokemon go wink i think nah ingress is pretty different i mean harry potter is also pretty different yes in a way in the way it's the same uh i i i'm curious if the the thought process for nintendo is pikmin 4 isn't going to sell well but if we put out a mobile game for pikmin that gets pikmin more on the radar because i do i do think that pocket camp helped for the switch version but why wouldn't pikmin 4 sell well because pikmin games don't super sell well why are they making them stop making games that don't sell put your resources towards making the trees in pokemon this is why there's not enough zero because there's a bunch of but f zero doesn't sell that well neither does metroid really i've made a lot more metroid fans that's because metroid fans are like crossfit fans they gotta let you know that they like metroid they're very adamant about super metroid and the mother brain and stuff but like metroid and pikmin are in f-zero they're not even close to the level of zelda and mario from eurogamer.net i'm familiar with that deluxe sales grow to series best in japan garden of hope pikmin 3 deluxe has finally become the series best-selling game in japan in terms of physical copies sold they've sold three nintendo's garden strategy three qual i hate this three equal is a bad word yes it is has now shifted how many box copies guess steve i'm gonna go i'm gonna say 1.5 million okay well this is boxes on shelves yep boxed copies oh that's like 18 because everybody does digital downloads nowadays uh there's now shifted 513k boxed copies that's not even a million enough to beat the original gamecube's pikmin's lifetime sales it also more than doubled pikmin 3's original sales for when it launched on the wii u that's about the population of wisconsin every single person in wisconsin bought a copy of pikmin here's another great line sure half a million copies sold does not rival mario and zelda's numbers but it's still not bad for a re-release of a third game after oh yeah yeah yeah franchise this is like going back to pokemon where people like like the worst selling pokemon game of all time is crystal and then the second worst selling pokemon game of all time is black 2y2 or whatever right but both those games sold a minimum of 6 million copies [Laughter] and people are like terrible disappointments i know how could they only sell six million pikmin can't even sell a million look and i love pikmin i do i really like pikmin i think they're great it's at dragging a lake on twitter for your pikmin hot takes please send them to at dragging a lake i will definitely be playing the niantic pikmin game of course for one day i'll play it as long as i played the harry potter thing which i need to get off my phone because they keep sending me updates and i don't care um i played the harry potter game for about five days and then felt like i think i got a week out of it before i was like no i think i would want a simpler game than pokemon go for pikmin so i could manage both because if it's more complicated which it doesn't seem i don't know if it's based on walking i don't like like harry potter was more complicated than go and that's why i feel like i fell off hard because i was like this game wants way too much of me right now um i mean pokemon go wants way too much of me right now so pikmin had better be real basic like jump in jump out i so my imagination is taking me to something along the lines of adventure sync where it will just track your number of steps and you know maybe you can recruit pikmin and then you like say like as i'm walking i'm deploying these particular pikmin types and it's a cookie clicker yeah not like a cookie clicking oh i mean everything is a cookie clicker and everything is not a cookie clip like a tower defense so either way it tracks where you walk and then it says because you had these pikmin in your party these are the resources that you acquired did you get the record resources that you need bring back trips trips never went anywhere dude bring back trips to your own life you have that choice you can bring trims back if you wished nobody else can credit to uh vincent and our slack for the uh players cup news types of pikmin are there now there's like six of them the only thing i know about pikmin is the 3ds puzzles and there were like three there was a red one a yellow one and a blue one yeah the blue one was very good at water and then the red one's very good at like not being on fire uh shout out to chris for the pikmin news um there's some other news but we're not not worth not worth talking about this week greg speaking of talking about stuff what is our question of the week all right hold on uh ready uh now's the time for the question of the week that was uh bruno mars uh what i like right am i right okay uh bobby says if you could take a specific video game replace all characters with pokemon which game would it be and why all characters like it's just a world of pokemon yeah because i mean we've tried that with mystery dungeon and seen what an abject failure that piece of hot trash garbage was or maybe are we thinking rumble blast a specific video game isn't the default just animal crossing i mean yeah but let's make it fun let's make it good let's make it uh no i got it what's the one in raccoon city resident evil resident resident evil except everything is pokemon how you get some jump scares i want to say like world of warcraft because i want a pokemon mmo but i don't want a world of warcraft style game they did yokai watching final fantasy they did it keeps coming back i got all the new weapons and they're really good um i would like an actual pokemon card racer like a mario kart but um the pokemon that you put into the cart actually like that does impact on how well the cart like performs pikachu it does like a little electric shock that revs the motor so it goes a little faster uh if you do like an abra you could teleport past jumps so you don't miss the jump uh what other things have we got if you got a drugs it's just heavy and hugs the road better uh venusaur no no no no no grass types throw up obstacles okay so it's like you can throw up a mushroom in front of your opponent or have tropius drop a neck banana poison types cause your opponents to uh the their like fuel gauge drops we're giving out a game to a company for free tmt have you have you met my life no my mario kart is a money-making machine they'll never stick anything else on that i try to think of anything else other games that i am actively playing well i don't want i don't know apex legends but with pokemon i mean loop hero but with pokemon absolutely love shrimps but with pokemon no because shrimps is bad no trims is good you stop playing tramps you can't say trips is good because you have no i stopped playing trips because i lost all my trims data yeah it started over the game and it has so much replayability you can start over that's legit with cookie clicker where my hard drive died and i lost all my cookies and actually i found my trims saved data on my work computer the other day because i had to go through and look in my old folders to make sure it was clean and didn't have personal information i had this thing marked trim so i'm like oh yeah that game i have actually recently started implementing this is gonna sound like it's my idea it's somebody else's idea but it's a cryptocurrency that kind of operates like trips so that's my current trip is that not just like dogecoin or something dogecoin is a cryptocurrency what if we it's like how you generate your cryptocurrency is this is very trump's like what if we took bejeweled but replaced all the jewels with pogba isn't that just pokemon shuffle would you stop could you stop this is a brilliant idea we'll call it pokemon shuffle 2. was bad compared to shuffle shuffle was significantly better the art style of trouser was outstanding what about a puzzle quest oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah puzzle quest so good yes that would be amazing i would like to see a battle puzzle quest pokemon game sold well get on it i'm i'm what about program what are these games programs is it c is it java it's apple apple is not a programming language is it apple's programming language no no that's not that's not real that's not real swift swift oh yeah they did have quota though they moved to swift look nobody's making any pokemon games in apple swift okay not that attitude you don't know what's happening at the niantic studio in japan we didn't even know it existed until 20 minutes ago true uh i mean animal crossing solid i'm trying to look at my phone if there's anything that i'm actively playing that isn't already pokemon related and there isn't what about a pokemon gotcha game where instead of pulling pokemon you pull the trainers off and they come with a pokemon awful the balance alone would be difficult for them to get right plus what i'm sure they would do too many banners and make it really confusing and they would just match trainers up with pokemon that aren't really theirs it would just be strange great willy nilly yep what about a pokemon hear me out okay clash royale i mean you know we'd play it yeah oh gosh clash royale i miss it i do you do you remember how bad that was towards the end there do you remember i've never wanted to throw my phone at a wall until i played clash royale wait i've got a really great idea because we've been focusing too much on video games unless the question specifically said video games or did it say gaming it did it so what about a version of magic the gathering yes except you use pokemon yeah instead of horrible satanic imagery yes i'm in okay i'm into that provided i can do a commander style pokemon game and not just rotate every s i mean but this this concept of mine is so genius good luck finding packs in stores because those cards are gonna sell once they once we get into the stores they will just not be around anymore uh i still want an mmo like still hardcore want an mmo uh pokemon go is there for you it's not there for me that is the bad implementation of an mmo and you know it you can customize your character you can drop money into it i love how the pokemon go battle league is literally the only pokemon battling system that nobody ever wants to do no those like those yeah well you're right those people literally are people out there we're having a competition it's a million dollar prize for the top pokemon go battle league player and it's like no one would ever win that prize because even if you entered the competition you'd like you'd hate the experience so much that you'd quit before you finished what about a street fighter style game but the fighters were pokemon but what if it wasn't street fighter and it was like tekken well i mean tekken's pretty good i mean they're one of the originals i could i could see it what about a balder's gate 3 style game but it's all pokemon and you actually have the story that you follow through and so it's a role-playing game but along the way you collect pokemon and you can use them in battles and you can what the [ __ ] am i now first boss was like a skarmory and at that point it still wasn't super enjoyable so you never beat the skarmory because you're like no thanks well what is our pokemon of the week i who knows i apologize in the in advance for this entire pokemon of the week segment because all i could think of in this transition was a pokemon first person shooter in the most evil way possible well duke nukem forever pokemon 94. there you go all right so greg already knew the answers to this because he looks at my snapchat story every single day yes people still using snapchat yeah you say that every time i mention the fact that i do shiny hunting in the most obscure method possible using snapchat and i watch it if you if you're if you if you're too cool for shiny hunts on twitch or youtube tv or whatever or folks are doing there are these ticky talks or snappy chat caffeine have you seen caffeine streaming service you can only do that on a phone it's real interesting if you're too cool for all those methods that all the kids are actually watching get up on my snapchat and watch me shiny hunt and have conversations with my buddy about anything and everything just i try to keep it clean because i know my niece is on there either way uh has to do with i because they announced brilliant diamond and shining pearl and i was like i'm gonna do a shiny sinnoh pokedex but i'm gonna use that same ditto i've been using for almost 10 years because it's from japan and that gives me that masuda method for shiny odds and i was like what's the first sinnoh pokemon that i so no pokedex pokemon that i can breed in galler and it is only possible to be this one after june 17 2020 uh otherwise the first sinnoh pokemon that would be available in gallery would have been magikarp what's the answer skarmory i don't think skarmory is even available in cinno [ __ ] axe well yeah well i'm sure it is it's not a fire pokemon so they probably included it it shanks shanks correct shinx was introduced in the isle of armor to the gala region and therefore became the first sinnoh regional pokedex pokemon that you could actually shiny hunt in galer i don't like it shuffle icon shanks is weird because it's got like this like emo kid like neckband it's wearing the black pants and it's like i'm i'm dark times and it's like but i'm actually electric yeah i also don't like this uh clockwork orange form in pokemon go listed here on bulbapedia not a fan it's got a great shiny though i have no idea what the shiny looks like because i still haven't gotten it it will all gold spoiler alert what if we wanted to discover that i don't need another joltik situation where i breed like six shinies and don't realize it because the only difference is that it has purple eyes [Music] uh yeah shakes is cool i mean it's like a little it's weird when people call shanks a dog because it's definitely like a lion yeah yeah well it's like the one thing i've learned one thing i've learned in pokemon is people don't know the difference between dogs and cats that's correct this is very true i mean it's based off of the mythical sphinx so well but the thing is right you you don't get the one key difference between dogs and cats in pokemon games if they would just reveal this then we'd have the answer dogs poop outside cats poop inside yes also i feel like the cat pokemon should just randomly throw things out of your bag oh then yeah isn't there um i'm pretty sure i have to look this up if you look at all the sprites of back in like gen 5 they're all facing i think right but skitty is the only sprite facing left i think sounds about right yeah sounds about right all right hold on what is this gen five uh yeah i think i think so this is bad this is bad podcasting content we're video now uh as greg is looking this up will give us all right let me okay so so all right here we go and this is why i was apologizing in advance because i don't know where i was when i actually wrote this uh literally unfortunately with a cursory review of my records i have pretty much covered every pokemon newly introduced in the sinnoh region over the years of composing pokemon of the week while i could rehash the pocket monsters that were introduced in 2006 weekly until the new versions are released i don't think our listeners would enjoy that did you know that there were four years between pokemon diamond and pearl games and the pokemon black and white games that was a four year wait for fully original content to arrive march 6 was the 10 year anniversary of the north american release of pokemon black and pokemon white which was not noted with any fanfare 10 years of the greatest pokemon games ever made i watched every episode of pokemon generations on friday night this week's pokemon was not featured in that program if you squid your eyes and look at this week's pokemon you should notice that the ends of its arms look like upper fangs while its knees and lower thorax look like lower teeth the majority of its throat and upper thorax look like a tongue or gaping maw in some ways it looks like this pokemon could be a pre-evolution to guzzlord this week's pokemon can only be found in nature not evolved into on victory road and sinnoh sometimes in a dragon friend safari remember those and in the haina desert through an sos battle you cannot find this week's pokemon in pokemon masters as it appears only the final evolution form was introduced around january 2020. yeah i don't know where i was going with that i'm sure there's a pokemon up in there somewhere but you get what you get i'm i haven't been sleeping so good did you find it greg no i got i did quickly i got into a different rabbit hole i did a quick search i couldn't find it but i'll i'll figure it out it'll make a good tic tac if i do oh wow there you go they'll be like you won't believe stop i don't believe which way this cat is facing stop scrolling i'm gonna blow your mind with some skinny facts and then people are gonna be like who's a skinny uh well that's been our episode uh we will be back next week uh thank you for listening thank you for making it to the end uh if uh if you want to follow us on twitter it is at dragging a lake for myself at white wing for greg at wash in the sink for will at pokemon podcast p-k-m-n-c-a-s-t for twitter youtube tik-tok instagram twitch all that stuff uh if you have been semi-keeping up with our nuzlocke on twitch uh on monday night we will be going through the victory road to get to the elite four and then hopefully on tuesday we'll be able to battle the well i don't know maybe i'll be able to battle you late for on monday but probably on tuesday unless like my party wipes and then i have to retrain then i think i just throw in the towel at that point i mean your party waves isn't that the end yeah yeah yeah uh there's a lot of look there's a lot of things that can explode in victory road i'm not very very scary they don't have bombs in pokemon games they do it's called electrode and voltorb ngo dude and graveler true true that's why you just have to have a ghost up front but wait doesn't explode only do as much damage as the hp of the pokemon that explodes no it's worse it's 250 i believe oh okay okay okay but uh a lot of people forgot because i they tell me all the time uh they're like oh don't worry it has sturdy or hey how did you get past 30. sturdy is awfully broken in gen 4. uh sturdy only protects against four
