I am (0:00 - 0:03)
[Music] (0:04 - 0:16)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:13 - 0:20)
the 615th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:16 - 0:22)
it&#39;s I have show notes it&#39;s super (0:20 - 0:25)
effective I&#39;m your host Steve with me is (0:22 - 0:29)
Hannah I am here I finally finished all (0:25 - 0:32)
the moving stuff this past week so I am (0:29 - 0:35)
exhausted but I&#39;m here I didn&#39;t move at (0:32 - 0:41)
all and I&#39;m exhausted um Fair Bobby also (0:35 - 0:45)
here uh hello (0:41 - 0:49)
um I I am here and actually now I have (0:45 - 0:52)
complaints like Hannah did about these (0:49 - 0:55)
shirts because I now have one they do (0:52 - 0:59)
not fit other they they do not fit like (0:55 - 1:01)
every other Pokemon go Fest shirt has (0:59 - 1:05)
fit in the past which is unfortunate I (1:01 - 1:07)
didn&#39;t know this that&#39;s our first bit of (1:05 - 1:11)
news the Niantic shirts are shipping (1:07 - 1:13)
yeah they are shipping they&#39;re shipping (1:11 - 1:16)
they&#39;re purple and they are a slight bit (1:13 - 1:19)
tighter than the previous years and I (1:16 - 1:21)
could say oh maybe I just like gained a (1:19 - 1:23)
little weight or something but I I (1:21 - 1:25)
actually bought last year shirt at the (1:23 - 1:28)
same time so I tried them both on today (1:25 - 1:30)
last year&#39;s shirt fits fine this your (1:28 - 1:34)
shirt same size is tighter so uh if (1:30 - 1:36)
you&#39;re going to buy maybe that might (1:34 - 1:37)
make you think that it&#39;s definitely (1:36 - 1:39)
smaller than like last year&#39;s shirt the (1:37 - 1:41)
year before that (1:39 - 1:43)
so is the (1:41 - 1:47)
the necros imprint (1:43 - 1:51)
like hard or like how did they print (1:47 - 1:56)
it hard yeah like it all feels the same (1:51 - 1:58)
like it all feels it feels like pass (1:56 - 2:01)
shirts is yes it feels exactly like pass (1:58 - 2:03)
shirts yeah yeah there like a certain (2:01 - 2:04)
printing style I can&#39;t remember what it (2:03 - 2:07)
is it&#39;s like yeah where it&#39;s kind of (2:04 - 2:09)
feels like it&#39;s laminated on there yeah (2:07 - 2:12)
yeah uh I mean it feels like every other (2:09 - 2:14)
go Fest shirt no no different so did you (2:12 - 2:15)
check the tags to see if it was a (2:14 - 2:17)
different (2:15 - 2:20)
brand I didn&#39;t but what from what I (2:17 - 2:22)
could see everything looked pretty much (2:20 - 2:24)
the same I mean I wasn&#39;t analyzing it (2:22 - 2:29)
like line by line but it looked similar (2:24 - 2:31)
to last year (2:29 - 2:34)
okay so yeah this is the breaking news (2:31 - 2:37)
we need on the (2:34 - 2:40)
show um we surprise surprise we have a (2:37 - 2:42)
lot of Pokemon sleep stuff to cover this (2:40 - 2:44)
week uh there&#39;s also some new events in (2:42 - 2:48)
scarlet and violet and uh Pokemon go is (2:44 - 2:52)
still moving forward with their (2:48 - 2:57)
rediscovering Community hate I (2:52 - 3:00)
guess people are uh still not excited (2:57 - 3:04)
about avatars stuff but um actually (3:00 - 3:05)
let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s we&#39;re going to do (3:04 - 3:07)
reverse we&#39;re going to end the show with (3:05 - 3:08)
Pokemon sleep we&#39;re going to start the (3:07 - 3:10)
show with Pokemon go because we were (3:08 - 3:13)
already talking about the Pokemon go (3:10 - 3:17)
shirt uh which apparently is shipping (3:13 - 3:20)
um they rolled out let&#39;s talk about the (3:17 - 3:22)
good stuff in Pokemon go they rolled out (3:20 - 3:26)
the new backgrounds they&#39;re absolutely (3:22 - 3:29)
fantastic they&#39;re super great there&#39;s a (3:26 - 3:32)
lot more than I thought there would (3:29 - 3:37)
be um yes and they&#39;re not I guess like I (3:32 - 3:40)
didn&#39;t really look at the beta stuff or (3:37 - 3:41)
I don&#39;t not beta but whatever Bobby was (3:40 - 3:44)
in the I&#39;m in California so I get Early (3:41 - 3:45)
Access (3:44 - 3:49)
stuff yeah but I thought like oh if you (3:45 - 3:51)
have city background there&#39;s just one (3:49 - 3:53)
city that will appear behind you but (3:51 - 3:57)
it&#39;s it&#39;s like different every time mhm (3:53 - 3:58)
I mean maybe there&#39;s like 10 of them but (3:57 - 4:00)
I I haven&#39;t been able to been like ah (3:58 - 4:03)
this is exactly the same one I saw (4:00 - 4:06)
yesterday yep definitely definitely a (4:03 - 4:08)
lot more than you&#39;d think uh like you (4:06 - 4:10)
said I was part of that whatever little (4:08 - 4:13)
small test group that they did uh which (4:10 - 4:15)
I still think is somewhat like location (4:13 - 4:18)
based because I would go to parts of San (4:15 - 4:21)
Diego any any beach stuff over the last (4:18 - 4:22)
few months I was not getting the new (4:21 - 4:24)
backgrounds so everything would change (4:22 - 4:27)
in my game if I got like on the coast uh (4:24 - 4:30)
it would all change back to the old game (4:27 - 4:33)
uh um but yeah I was surprised at how (4:30 - 4:36)
many different backgrounds there are for (4:33 - 4:39)
each uh for each biome I mean I&#39;ll be in (4:36 - 4:41)
my house if I&#39;m if the Pokemon is in (4:39 - 4:42)
different directions you got different (4:41 - 4:44)
backgrounds you know all in the same (4:42 - 4:48)
place so uh it is cool that they weren&#39;t (4:44 - 4:50)
just like oh let&#39;s do one for each biome (4:48 - 4:52)
like here&#39;s six new backgrounds you know (4:50 - 4:54)
it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely a lot more than (4:52 - 4:56)
that and they look (4:54 - 4:58)
fantastic it almost feels like upgrading (4:56 - 5:01)
to a new game in some ways cuz they (4:58 - 5:03)
changed the overall map too they changed (5:01 - 5:06)
the Overworld map at the same time mhm (5:03 - 5:08)
and you can kind of when you&#39;re looking (5:06 - 5:11)
at the Overworld map you can kind of see (5:08 - 5:14)
where a new location might actually be (5:11 - 5:17)
yeah there&#39;s more distinct lines between (5:14 - 5:19)
some of the different places I mean at (5:17 - 5:22)
least Parks stand out a whole lot more (5:19 - 5:25)
oh yeah yeah yeah I was I was one (5:22 - 5:28)
Wheeling around Lake Nomas which is like (5:25 - 5:31)
a pretty big lake (5:28 - 5:35)
um in the the Minneapolis area and it (5:31 - 5:37)
had (5:35 - 5:41)
the like beach or like not not beach but (5:37 - 5:42)
like (5:41 - 5:45)
Lakeside uh effect which I know there&#39;s (5:42 - 5:47)
a separate one for beach and I&#39;m curious (5:45 - 5:49)
because Lake Nomas has like the world&#39;s (5:47 - 5:52)
smallest Beach it&#39;s like it&#39;s like this (5:49 - 5:54)
like tiny area but I&#39;m curious if I was (5:52 - 5:57)
to go over there if that would change (5:54 - 5:59)
but it was cool seeing the like that was (5:57 - 6:03)
the first time I saw Riverside area um (5:59 - 6:04)
and I was like man this looks so great (6:03 - 6:06)
cuz I didn&#39;t I never saw that one on (6:04 - 6:08)
Twitter or or social media so seeing it (6:06 - 6:10)
the first time was like dang this looks (6:08 - 6:13)
good (6:10 - 6:16)
um yeah that&#39;s one thing I I tried to (6:13 - 6:17)
keep from I mean I started doing it like (6:16 - 6:20)
in the slack and stuff but I when I was (6:17 - 6:22)
screenshotting stuff while I was (6:20 - 6:23)
thinking oh you know maybe I shouldn&#39;t (6:22 - 6:25)
be like posting this so that people get (6:23 - 6:27)
their own first like look and they&#39;re (6:25 - 6:29)
not like I&#39;ve seen all these backgrounds (6:27 - 6:32)
you know and so there was a lot that I (6:29 - 6:34)
didn&#39;t post but then I was again the (6:32 - 6:36)
beach stuff was all brand new to me so I (6:34 - 6:38)
think the first time I saw the beach (6:36 - 6:42)
background was like when Wiglet came out (6:38 - 6:44)
like on was on what that was on Monday (6:42 - 6:46)
right that was on last yeah um when the (6:44 - 6:48)
backgrounds came out so that was the (6:46 - 6:50)
first time I had seen the beach (6:48 - 6:52)
background which is pretty (6:50 - 6:52)
cool yeah they&#39;re they&#39;re super great (6:53 - 7:00)
and I (6:57 - 7:04)
and it&#39;s so weird that I I haven&#39;t seen (7:00 - 7:07)
anyone complain about them or be upset (7:04 - 7:09)
about them I&#39;ve only seen positive (7:07 - 7:11)
things and it&#39;s so weird that (7:09 - 7:16)
like the Avatar stuff was kind of the (7:11 - 7:18)
opposite (7:16 - 7:20)
reaction yeah part of me (7:18 - 7:22)
wonders I guess it worked out how they (7:20 - 7:25)
did it because part of me was like maybe (7:22 - 7:26)
they should have released them like the (7:25 - 7:30)
same day and just cut the like you you (7:26 - 7:32)
know cut it in half so you have like a (7:30 - 7:33)
bunch of complaining but a bunch of (7:32 - 7:36)
positive stuff all at the same time but (7:33 - 7:37)
then obviously they don&#39;t want to (7:36 - 7:39)
release two features at the exact same (7:37 - 7:40)
time to everybody because that probably (7:39 - 7:43)
would have crashed the game knowing just (7:40 - 7:47)
Nan taking the past um so you know maybe (7:43 - 7:49)
it was good to do both I will say the (7:47 - 7:52)
one thing yeah my only complaint is that (7:49 - 7:55)
the Ino snapshot the assets from the (7:52 - 7:58)
encounter background screen are (7:55 - 8:01)
appearing like in the sky so I&#39;ll see (7:58 - 8:04)
rocks or like bushes or trees not not (8:01 - 8:06)
trees it&#39;s like bushes or like Hedges (8:04 - 8:10)
and rocks will just appear in the sky (8:06 - 8:13)
and uh you know you reset the game and (8:10 - 8:16)
it it seems to work again sometimes but (8:13 - 8:19)
then if you click off and go to another (8:16 - 8:23)
Pokemon uh it it kind of like it&#39;s Hit (8:19 - 8:24)
or Miss like it might happen it might (8:23 - 8:26)
not happen and you have to reset the (8:24 - 8:28)
game and then it seems to work so I know (8:26 - 8:30)
obviously they&#39;re doing (8:28 - 8:34)
the um update for go snapshot as well (8:30 - 8:35)
and I know some people in Australia now (8:34 - 8:38)
have that there&#39;s a small test group (8:35 - 8:39)
there that now can place multiple (8:38 - 8:41)
Pokemon and do all of that so maybe it (8:39 - 8:43)
came with that I don&#39;t know it&#39;s (8:41 - 8:44)
something within the last like week and (8:43 - 8:48)
a half though made using go snapshot a (8:44 - 8:49)
lot (8:48 - 8:52)
worse which is not great leading up to (8:49 - 8:55)
them trying to make it better so well we (8:52 - 8:58)
only have about a week until that update (8:55 - 9:00)
I know but as someone who uses it a lot (8:58 - 9:05)
a week feels like a long ways (9:00 - 9:05)
away uh leak duck put out a a poll here (9:07 - 9:16)
with 16,000 votes which is a lot I mean (9:12 - 9:17)
it&#39;s a (9:16 - 9:19)
lot (9:17 - 9:22)
for a quick like how do you feel about (9:19 - 9:24)
this I mean there&#39;s millions of people (9:22 - 9:28)
who play Pokemon go but 16,000 is is a (9:24 - 9:30)
lot of people uh (9:28 - 9:34)
4.9% of people say they love the Avatar (9:30 - 9:36)
update (9:34 - 9:39)
25.4% so 1 14th of people say it&#39;s okay (9:36 - 9:41)
and then (9:39 - 9:44)
69.7% of people say they are not a (9:41 - 9:50)
fan um which I think what maybe Greg (9:44 - 9:52)
mentioned last week is maybe Niantic (9:50 - 9:54)
thought it would be closer to (9:52 - 9:59)
5050 remember this is still on Twitter (9:54 - 9:59)
that factors some things (10:00 - 10:06)
into just to mention that this you know (10:03 - 10:09)
Twitter&#39;s very negative this poll was on (10:06 - 10:11)
a social media platform that not (10:09 - 10:13)
everybody uses anymore not that (10:11 - 10:14)
everybody used it in the first place but (10:13 - 10:17)
a lot of people have stopped for reasons (10:14 - 10:19)
yeah Twitter made up of uh only one in (10:17 - 10:22)
10 adults were actually using Twitter (10:19 - 10:24)
when it was (10:22 - 10:24)
Twitter but yeah having almost 70% of (10:26 - 10:32)
people really hate the new Avatar update (10:30 - 10:35)
is sad yeah I would definitely be in the (10:32 - 10:37)
it&#39;s okay camp and I probably would have (10:35 - 10:39)
been in the love it Camp if I hadn&#39;t (10:37 - 10:44)
been listening to everybody who (10:39 - 10:48)
doesn&#39;t yeah I I will say when again (10:44 - 10:50)
when I got the early test version of (10:48 - 10:53)
this um which by the way of all the (10:50 - 10:54)
three things that they&#39;re coming out (10:53 - 10:56)
with with this ReDiscover campaign like (10:54 - 10:58)
I&#39;m glad like I got the encounter back (10:56 - 11:00)
screen or background earlier that Avatar (10:58 - 11:02)
earlier but I really would have loved (11:00 - 11:03)
the ghost snapshot thing earlier I would (11:02 - 11:05)
have traded that in a heartbeat to get (11:03 - 11:07)
the ghost snapshot thing early but you (11:05 - 11:10)
know that is what it is um anyways uh (11:07 - 11:14)
when I first saw it I thought okay I (11:10 - 11:17)
don&#39;t I&#39;m not a huge fan but maybe (11:14 - 11:19)
that&#39;s just me you know so I didn&#39;t put (11:17 - 11:21)
a whole lot of thought into it I kind of (11:19 - 11:24)
made my avatar look a certain way that I (11:21 - 11:27)
was like okay I&#39;m I&#39;m good with this uh (11:24 - 11:29)
I I again the overall concept great so (11:27 - 11:31)
I&#39;ll just kind of leave it at that and (11:29 - 11:34)
again it&#39;s a it was the small test group (11:31 - 11:35)
so maybe they&#39;re improving it you know (11:34 - 11:38)
like with the backgrounds there was a (11:35 - 11:40)
lot of tweaks that happened over the (11:38 - 11:41)
last three months with those backgrounds (11:40 - 11:45)
it was not just this is it and then it (11:41 - 11:47)
came out with the avatars was the (11:45 - 11:48)
opposite it was that&#39;s it and it came (11:47 - 11:50)
out and it didn&#39;t change anything in (11:48 - 11:54)
that time and so when I when it did come (11:50 - 11:57)
out and I hadn&#39;t even been on social (11:54 - 12:00)
media yet uh on that whatever it was (11:57 - 12:02)
Thursday or Friday that it came (12:00 - 12:04)
out I just heard like I think I got text (12:02 - 12:07)
messages from people that were like uh (12:04 - 12:08)
what did they do with this and then I (12:07 - 12:11)
hopped online and was like oh no one (12:08 - 12:16)
likes this like this is not good um (12:11 - 12:20)
so sounds like they&#39;re looking at taking (12:16 - 12:22)
feedback which is weird because there (12:20 - 12:25)
was a there was feedback before like (12:22 - 12:27)
with the small test group with other PE (12:25 - 12:28)
there was it&#39;s not like this is they (12:27 - 12:31)
didn&#39;t have feedback and then all of a (12:28 - 12:34)
sudden are getting a ton of feedback (12:31 - 12:36)
like they had feedback there was there (12:34 - 12:37)
was it was a month or two that people (12:36 - 12:40)
had that some people had this and they (12:37 - 12:43)
were saying things about it so it feels (12:40 - 12:46)
like they I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not going to (12:43 - 12:48)
take that statement any further but uh (12:46 - 12:50)
it sounds like they are taking feedback (12:48 - 12:52)
now so hopefully there will be some some (12:50 - 12:56)
tweaks done some (12:52 - 12:56)
fixes yeah it only took them over for a (12:56 - 13:05)
year to rework the Mega System after (12:59 - 13:05)
feedback although this doesn&#39;t maybe (13:05 - 13:09)
seem like the mega system was a complete (13:07 - 13:11)
rework from like the ground up and (13:09 - 13:13)
everything that was a whole new system (13:11 - 13:16)
this is just listening to feedback and (13:13 - 13:21)
improving visuals hopefully yeah um and (13:16 - 13:24)
I I said last week I was just so shocked (13:21 - 13:28)
about how many limited hairstyles there (13:24 - 13:30)
was like that (13:28 - 13:34)
was pretty shocking that like I was (13:30 - 13:36)
excited to have a hair I don&#39;t know I (13:34 - 13:38)
guess I think of um the scarlet and (13:36 - 13:40)
violet (13:38 - 13:42)
editor and I don&#39;t think the scarlet and (13:40 - 13:45)
violet character customization thing is (13:42 - 13:49)
that advanced or complicated or but I (13:45 - 13:52)
think it does it well enough where (13:49 - 13:55)
people feel like they can make their (13:52 - 13:58)
face in a very like I would say there&#39;s (13:55 - 14:00)
like a more chibi (13:58 - 14:02)
way in scarlet and violet right not like (14:00 - 14:03)
a (14:02 - 14:05)
realistic not that not that niantic&#39;s (14:03 - 14:08)
characters before were realistic but (14:05 - 14:10)
Scarlet Violet&#39;s definitely more chibi (14:08 - 14:14)
um but not Pokemon Pokemon style where (14:10 - 14:16)
you are a child going out into the (14:14 - 14:19)
Pokemon world yeah very (14:16 - 14:23)
very childlike faces but still it&#39;s not (14:19 - 14:25)
that what like Scarlet Violet feels like (14:23 - 14:27)
it has I don&#39;t actually know but it it (14:25 - 14:30)
has over like 20 haircuts maybe even 30 (14:27 - 14:32)
like there&#39;s a lot of haircuts that you (14:30 - 14:34)
can get yeah um and most of them look (14:32 - 14:38)
good as opposed to the new haircuts in (14:34 - 14:43)
go where most of them don&#39;t well I mean (14:38 - 14:46)
I just you think about like they want to (14:43 - 14:49)
do this so that people can look more (14:46 - 14:50)
like themselves right and i&#39; I&#39;ve also (14:49 - 14:52)
heard the argument where people say you (14:50 - 14:53)
don&#39;t have to look like yourself you can (14:52 - 14:55)
look like whatever you want so just (14:53 - 14:56)
change it to something else and that&#39;s (14:55 - 14:59)
fine but the whole point of adding all (14:56 - 15:01)
these custom a in is to be able to make (14:59 - 15:03)
it look more like yourself or else why (15:01 - 15:04)
do that like you could just have the (15:03 - 15:07)
avatars however you want otherwise right (15:04 - 15:10)
so when they do that and then they&#39;re (15:07 - 15:13)
like and here&#39;s the long hair style (15:10 - 15:15)
choices and it&#39;s literally what the (15:13 - 15:19)
default female one was previously and (15:15 - 15:21)
then they added one (15:19 - 15:25)
more it&#39;s like why even do that like you (15:21 - 15:27)
got to add more choices there you you (15:25 - 15:31)
added one more long hairstyle like it (15:27 - 15:34)
doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t know it just feels (15:31 - 15:36)
like they just there just needs to be (15:34 - 15:39)
more and maybe now that that&#39;s in there (15:36 - 15:41)
this way it might be a little bit easier (15:39 - 15:44)
for them to just add more Styles because (15:41 - 15:46)
yeah buy new haircuts they&#39;ll just be (15:44 - 15:48)
you know $1.99 each oh that&#39;s what it&#39;s (15:46 - 15:50)
going to be isn&#39;t it (15:48 - 15:53)
like you can really ReDiscover yourself (15:50 - 15:56)
and your wallet at the same time you get (15:53 - 15:58)
the Mr you can do the Mr mime research (15:56 - 16:00)
and get a haircut to match or something (15:58 - 16:01)
for (16:00 - 16:03)
$5 I&#39;m fully expecting that for facial (16:01 - 16:07)
hair I will say maybe not for hair a (16:03 - 16:11)
beard for yeah just because that&#39;s how (16:07 - 16:14)
they&#39;ve implemented it so far yeah (16:11 - 16:16)
didn&#39;t even think about that I&#39;m I&#39;m not (16:14 - 16:18)
bald (16:16 - 16:23)
yet maybe eventually um true uh but if (16:18 - 16:26)
you put on like the gutina helmet and (16:23 - 16:28)
you turn your character around your (16:26 - 16:32)
character is is bald like it removes the (16:28 - 16:37)
hair why was there no bald option for (16:32 - 16:38)
the people who (16:37 - 16:41)
are bald whether that&#39;s the choice or (16:38 - 16:43)
not there isn&#39;t even I didn&#39;t even think (16:41 - 16:46)
about the fact there not like a bald (16:43 - 16:47)
there&#39;s no (16:46 - 16:51)
beard um glasses should not cost money (16:47 - 16:52)
that (16:51 - 16:55)
is that is I think the cheapest glasses (16:52 - 16:58)
is like 50 poke coins but like they&#39;ve (16:55 - 17:02)
always had some free glasses I think I (16:58 - 17:04)
thought the glasses were always (17:02 - 17:07)
paid uh I think maybe there were a (17:04 - 17:10)
couple of colors that were (17:07 - 17:14)
free but there&#39;s just like they they (17:10 - 17:17)
just I think the point being you go back (17:14 - 17:20)
to like 5% of people like it 25% of (17:17 - 17:22)
people are okay with it that&#39;s like 30% (17:20 - 17:24)
of people that are like tolerating the (17:22 - 17:27)
update but when I think of like a (17:24 - 17:30)
complete redesign and again we have just (17:27 - 17:32)
literally case in point this week of the (17:30 - 17:35)
backgrounds which everyone loves (17:32 - 17:37)
universally I&#39;m sure there&#39;s one person (17:35 - 17:39)
out there being like I really hate like (17:37 - 17:40)
yeah I&#39;m sure that person exists that (17:39 - 17:43)
they hate it but like they just had this (17:40 - 17:44)
opportunity (17:43 - 17:48)
to have like two wins under their (17:44 - 17:52)
belt and I don&#39;t know who was on the (17:48 - 17:56)
Avatar team or who approved it or if (17:52 - 17:58)
they had more things but it needed to (17:56 - 17:59)
come out the same time as as this (17:58 - 18:01)
background at the same time as this AR (17:59 - 18:03)
because they needed all this stuff to I (18:01 - 18:05)
mean real in the reality this is like (18:03 - 18:06)
all of this was probably planned several (18:05 - 18:08)
months ago and it was like okay we need (18:06 - 18:10)
to ship it because it&#39;s part of our (18:08 - 18:13)
start of summer before go Fest reinvent (18:10 - 18:18)
your self campaign but like just the (18:13 - 18:22)
limiting choices of hairstyles and (18:18 - 18:25)
options and the clothes still clipping (18:22 - 18:26)
and even if you did find a hairstyle you (18:25 - 18:28)
like it doesn&#39;t work with the hat or the (18:26 - 18:32)
hairand you like (18:28 - 18:36)
and I it&#39;s subjective but a a lot of (18:32 - 18:38)
people myself included think the avatars (18:36 - 18:41)
don&#39;t look as good (18:38 - 18:43)
and I don&#39;t have a problem with the (18:41 - 18:47)
faces as much as I do like the shoulders (18:43 - 18:49)
and the (18:47 - 18:53)
hands um the hands that&#39;s very specific (18:49 - 18:56)
yeah like you know the obstagoon pose (18:53 - 18:58)
where they put the hands in front of you (18:56 - 19:00)
literally no one uses that if you see (18:58 - 19:04)
before and after of the obstagoon pose (19:00 - 19:06)
um the hands on the new characters are (19:04 - 19:09)
just so much bigger than the hands on (19:06 - 19:12)
the old character oh yeah yeah I use the (19:09 - 19:14)
pose where it&#39;s like I&#39;m throwing the (19:12 - 19:16)
gift in the air like throwing the gift (19:14 - 19:18)
behind my back and catching it and now (19:16 - 19:19)
that you mention it and it maybe it&#39;s (19:18 - 19:21)
just cuz you just said it but the (19:19 - 19:24)
fingers seem oddly long on me as I&#39;m (19:21 - 19:27)
holding the gift like it it does seem (19:24 - 19:30)
like maybe the hands are hm I have and I (19:27 - 19:32)
had heard a little bit about that online (19:30 - 19:36)
like I had seen scrolling through uh (19:32 - 19:37)
like threads or something and seen (19:36 - 19:41)
people like mention the hands (19:37 - 19:43)
um but I hadn&#39;t put too much thought (19:41 - 19:45)
into that part of it&#39;s way more obvious (19:43 - 19:47)
if you&#39;re using like the obson pose yeah (19:45 - 19:50)
I&#39;m GNA use the obson pose now but I (19:47 - 19:53)
still just think they look I still think (19:50 - 19:55)
it&#39;s just a different style that they (19:53 - 19:58)
just look different I don&#39;t think that (19:55 - 20:01)
it&#39;s bad (19:58 - 20:01)
I don&#39;t know I&#39;m looking at a bunch of (20:01 - 20:04)
different people on my friends list (20:02 - 20:06)
right now and I see what you&#39;re saying (20:04 - 20:07)
that the hands are bigger but that&#39;s (20:06 - 20:10)
just a different art style (20:07 - 20:13)
thing the hands are bigger especially (20:10 - 20:16)
the lsti in post it might be like what (20:13 - 20:19)
what Greg said is like you can adjust (20:16 - 20:22)
your weight and your shoulders and your (20:19 - 20:24)
chest and there&#39;s like one more slider (20:22 - 20:27)
muscle the muscle slider M but like your (20:24 - 20:29)
head doesn&#39;t change or your arm length (20:27 - 20:31)
doesn&#39;t change or you&#39;re so I think I (20:29 - 20:34)
think it&#39;s maybe that I think (20:31 - 20:37)
like because your hands your arms your (20:34 - 20:40)
legs and your head are not moving in any (20:37 - 20:42)
of that (20:40 - 20:45)
[Laughter] (20:42 - 20:48)
situation they&#39;re (20:45 - 20:51)
trying they are trying that is I wish (20:48 - 20:53)
that was one of the leak duck options (20:51 - 20:55)
for that poll they are trying dot dot (20:53 - 20:57)
dot I would have chosen that one 100% (20:55 - 21:00)
I&#39;m still kind of refining my list of (20:57 - 21:01)
the things that I think would have (21:00 - 21:03)
gotten it to be better and it continues (21:01 - 21:07)
to be something like more hairstyles (21:03 - 21:09)
that are better integrated um I think (21:07 - 21:11)
I&#39;ve added facial hair I think that a (21:09 - 21:12)
lot of people would be more comfortable (21:11 - 21:14)
with their characters if they were able (21:12 - 21:15)
to add (21:14 - 21:18)
that um then a waist slider was (21:15 - 21:20)
something a lot of people wanted and (21:18 - 21:22)
being able to have the whole body move (21:20 - 21:24)
proportionally to the weight slider (21:22 - 21:27)
including the head yeah so cuz I was (21:24 - 21:29)
going to I was going to say like I think (21:27 - 21:33)
one thing um is like face shape like you (21:29 - 21:34)
know even if it doesn&#39;t have to be on a (21:33 - 21:37)
slider or anything but just having a few (21:34 - 21:39)
different options for for like head (21:37 - 21:42)
shape or face shape has that too um what (21:39 - 21:44)
does scarlet and violet they have they (21:42 - 21:46)
have like head shape they have I think (21:44 - 21:48)
like six or seven of them yeah I (21:46 - 21:51)
something like that would have been nice (21:48 - 21:53)
also I know I have heard a lot of people (21:51 - 21:56)
talking about the skin colors like they (21:53 - 21:59)
hit on a lot more obviously but then (21:56 - 22:02)
there are just some where it&#39;s like (21:59 - 22:04)
could it just done like a slider or (22:02 - 22:06)
something for like pick one and then (22:04 - 22:09)
kind of two a slider for where to fit (22:06 - 22:11)
within that you know within that skin (22:09 - 22:14)
tone um so I know people have been (22:11 - 22:16)
talking about that as well which I the (22:14 - 22:17)
weird thing about the skin color and I (22:16 - 22:19)
said this last week is it feels like (22:17 - 22:22)
it&#39;s lighting based because the the (22:19 - 22:25)
color you&#39;re picking in the color (22:22 - 22:27)
picking window looks like the color you (22:25 - 22:30)
should be and then when you go out to (22:27 - 22:32)
your character it either looks way (22:30 - 22:34)
brighter or way (22:32 - 22:36)
darker and when I think about like the (22:34 - 22:38)
lighting in the game the thing that (22:36 - 22:42)
surprised me about the new backgrounds (22:38 - 22:44)
is the characters are lit the Pokemon (22:42 - 22:47)
the characters the Pokemon are (22:44 - 22:50)
lit differently whether the moon is out (22:47 - 22:53)
or the sun is out or it&#39;s dusk or if (22:50 - 22:57)
there&#39;s a water behind the Pokemon it&#39;s (22:53 - 22:59)
like reflecting off that (22:57 - 23:02)
like it&#39;s more than just like the new (22:59 - 23:04)
background they did like some sort of (23:02 - 23:06)
lighting system with it and it&#39;s really (23:04 - 23:09)
great where where was the lighting team (23:06 - 23:13)
when the Avatar team was picking (23:09 - 23:13)
colors yeah (23:15 - 23:19)
yeah it (23:17 - 23:23)
is it is kind of surprising how (23:19 - 23:25)
different the reception to these (23:23 - 23:28)
rollouts has been I mean within what it (23:25 - 23:30)
was April 17th when the Avatar one (23:28 - 23:32)
dropped and then it was April 22nd when (23:30 - 23:34)
the encounters and just watching social (23:32 - 23:39)
media just the wave of uh going from oh (23:34 - 23:41)
my gosh we all hate this and then Earth (23:39 - 23:43)
Day comes around and it&#39;s oh my gosh we (23:41 - 23:46)
all love this you just so so weird to (23:43 - 23:50)
see that change happen um so (23:46 - 23:53)
quickly but it worked I guess for to (23:50 - 23:55)
some extent for an (23:53 - 23:58)
Niantic people are still pretty annoyed (23:55 - 24:00)
yes they are but there was a lot there (23:58 - 24:03)
was a considerably less amount of (24:00 - 24:07)
negativity Monday Tuesday with uh the (24:03 - 24:10)
Social Media stuff then uh the prior (24:07 - 24:13)
week when the Avatar stuff came (24:10 - 24:13)
out yeah (24:13 - 24:19)
I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think the camera stuff (24:17 - 24:22)
is going to be like a win for them like (24:19 - 24:24)
I just don&#39;t think enough (24:22 - 24:27)
people you I mean like Bobby&#39;s here (24:24 - 24:30)
obviously but I just it&#39;s small it&#39;s (24:27 - 24:32)
yeah that&#39;s not a big that&#39;s not a huge (24:30 - 24:34)
Feature A lot of people don&#39;t even want (24:32 - 24:37)
to do anything related to a lot of (24:34 - 24:38)
people are like why do they even have (24:37 - 24:40)
anything AR in this game just just give (24:38 - 24:43)
us you know what we do on a regular (24:40 - 24:47)
basis but yeah and and from what I&#39;ve (24:43 - 24:50)
heard it&#39;s it&#39;s from the small test (24:47 - 24:53)
group so far from the little I&#39;ve seen (24:50 - 24:57)
um it&#39;s good but it&#39;s not like (24:53 - 25:00)
gamechanging for go snapshot or anything (24:57 - 25:03)
um I I think it will be a positive but (25:00 - 25:04)
yeah it&#39;ll be a positive for a very (25:03 - 25:07)
small group of people at the end of the (25:04 - 25:09)
day a very small positive for a very (25:07 - 25:13)
small group of people yeah (25:09 - 25:14)
exactly (25:13 - 25:17)
uh if you listen to our podcast every (25:14 - 25:19)
week and I know there are some listeners (25:17 - 25:23)
that do not play Pokemon go uh (25:19 - 25:26)
maybe you might care about Pokémon go (25:23 - 25:29)
here because Dian is returning to (25:26 - 25:30)
Pokémon (25:29 - 25:34)
go which I say that because there&#39;s not (25:30 - 25:37)
a lot of ways to get (25:34 - 25:37)
her they haven&#39;t done a distribution for (25:37 - 25:45)
for Dian in a while uh but there will be (25:41 - 25:48)
a special research story Glitz and Glam (25:45 - 25:51)
available to all trainers on for free (25:48 - 25:53)
for free which is (25:51 - 25:55)
very not a word commonly used in (25:53 - 25:58)
niantic&#39;s vocabulary uh starting on May (25:55 - 26:00)
1 at 10: am trainers who complete the (25:58 - 26:02)
special research will earn an encounter (26:00 - 26:04)
with the mythical Pokemon Dian the (26:02 - 26:07)
special research will not expire um but (26:04 - 26:09)
you have to obviously like log in and (26:07 - 26:11)
claim it and then once you claim it it (26:09 - 26:13)
won&#39;t (26:11 - 26:15)
expire (26:13 - 26:18)
uh and it doesn&#39;t say what you have to (26:15 - 26:21)
do but if if you are missing a diance (26:18 - 26:25)
for your Pokedex or your Pokemon home (26:21 - 26:28)
Pokedex you can log in you can claim it (26:25 - 26:29)
you can do This research at your own (26:28 - 26:32)
pace you can once you get the Dian you (26:29 - 26:35)
can move it to Pokemon home and then (26:32 - 26:36)
won&#39;t have to worry about playing (26:35 - 26:39)
Pokemon go again until your next (26:36 - 26:42)
mythical Pokemon you&#39;re missing you can (26:39 - 26:43)
right you can transfer this one to (26:42 - 26:45)
Pokemon home yeah I (26:43 - 26:49)
I hadn&#39;t seen I know there&#39;s a few (26:45 - 26:53)
that are there any that stop you anymore (26:49 - 26:57)
um used to obviously you cannot (26:53 - 27:01)
move okay and cosmog I don&#39;t think you (26:57 - 27:04)
could have moved (27:01 - 27:06)
initially yeah you couldn&#39;t initially I (27:04 - 27:08)
feel like that&#39;s changed but I (27:06 - 27:11)
definitely haven&#39;t checked it yeah oh (27:08 - 27:12)
the usually the Restriction is around (27:11 - 27:14)
you need to keep this Pokemon to finish (27:12 - 27:17)
some research story and we can&#39;t have (27:14 - 27:18)
you taking (27:17 - 27:20)
it I don&#39;t know there might be people (27:18 - 27:22)
that like roll their eyes and they&#39;re (27:20 - 27:23)
like I&#39;m still not going to play Pokemon (27:22 - 27:25)
go for a mythical Pokemon but then I (27:23 - 27:27)
kind of think of like you (27:25 - 27:30)
have so many people go I don&#39;t want to (27:27 - 27:33)
go to GameStop and get my Dian that (27:30 - 27:36)
doesn&#39;t feel very (27:33 - 27:38)
mythical (27:36 - 27:40)
right like I I feel like there&#39;s no (27:38 - 27:43)
winning with those people sure was there (27:40 - 27:45)
another way so I&#39;m looking right now at (27:43 - 27:48)
like dcy distributions and it looks like (27:45 - 27:49)
unless I&#39;m looking at this incorrectly (27:48 - 27:51)
it looks like the last time it was even (27:49 - 27:54)
distributed um in like main Series games (27:51 - 27:55)
was in (27:54 - 27:58)
2016 yep yeah that&#39;s why I&#39;m bringing (27:55 - 28:01)
this up right and it wasn&#39;t part of the (27:58 - 28:05)
year of mythical giveaways so right it (28:01 - 28:08)
wasn&#39;t a part of that no so it looks (28:05 - 28:11)
like it was like6 so actually 2016 in (28:08 - 28:13)
South Korea but 2015 in the US was the (28:11 - 28:16)
last time that it was distributed here (28:13 - 28:18)
um well I mean besides it also being in (28:16 - 28:20)
Pokemon go prior to this again so sorry (28:18 - 28:22)
I meant just for main series (28:20 - 28:25)
distribution right yeah but um yeah and (28:22 - 28:26)
then it was in Pokemon go I don&#39;t I (28:25 - 28:29)
don&#39;t even remember was it a go f thing (28:26 - 28:33)
it was yeah okay okay yeah um so not a (28:29 - 28:35)
lot of people have it but if you&#39;ve (28:33 - 28:37)
already done that research for the go (28:35 - 28:39)
Fest diany you&#39;re going to get candy (28:37 - 28:40)
instead of a second diany this time (28:39 - 28:42)
around why don&#39;t they want people to (28:40 - 28:44)
have diany what is so special about Dany (28:42 - 28:46)
that they&#39;re really holding back that&#39;s (28:44 - 28:49)
why I was talking to the non-go players (28:46 - 28:50)
this is your (28:49 - 28:51)
chance (28:50 - 28:54)
[Laughter] (28:51 - 28:57)
jeez usually usually for again for the (28:54 - 28:59)
non-go players who might want to die an (28:57 - 29:03)
say or if you didn&#39;t get it from the go (28:59 - 29:05)
Fest one initially CU you didn&#39;t log in (29:03 - 29:06)
that weekend to like claim the go Fest (29:05 - 29:09)
stuff you would obviously be able to (29:06 - 29:12)
have access to this because it&#39;s free um (29:09 - 29:16)
these are usually pretty easy there the (29:12 - 29:19)
the the the difficulty if you even want (29:16 - 29:22)
to consider that is it might have (29:19 - 29:24)
something like spin a poké stop every (29:22 - 29:27)
day for seven days or or 10 days or (29:24 - 29:30)
something mhm so that&#39;s like H I got to (29:27 - 29:32)
go out and walk down the street and spin (29:30 - 29:34)
a stop like that&#39;s usually how difficult (29:32 - 29:36)
they get (29:34 - 29:38)
um it&#39;s not going to be something like (29:36 - 29:42)
get a hundred excellent throws in a r (29:38 - 29:44)
right right well I&#39;m a little surprised (29:42 - 29:48)
that it&#39;s a free event for a mythical (29:44 - 29:50)
right because I mean think about the (29:48 - 29:51)
last mythical that they gave us in (29:50 - 29:54)
Pokemon go with a ticket it was $8 for a (29:51 - 29:57)
zerude and that se Dot and you got a SE (29:54 - 29:59)
dot encounter during that 8 ticket but (29:57 - 30:03)
you know it was $8 for a zerude and I (29:59 - 30:06)
don&#39;t know it&#39;s not typically free for (30:03 - 30:10)
these um random like mythical events in (30:06 - 30:14)
Pokemon go so what I saw is actually (30:10 - 30:18)
every Pokemon go Fest mythical has been (30:14 - 30:22)
free after the fact so since zerude (30:18 - 30:25)
wasn&#39;t go Fest or CIO wasn&#39;t go Fest (30:22 - 30:28)
those were paid the only exception to (30:25 - 30:29)
the (30:28 - 30:31)
you were at go Fest so now you&#39;re free (30:29 - 30:35)
for everyone is celab MHM and that&#39;s I (30:31 - 30:38)
believe because they use celby for the (30:35 - 30:40)
zerude (30:38 - 30:43)
movie um and that one was also shiny as (30:40 - 30:47)
well shiny was Shin for everyone so it (30:43 - 30:50)
is F this isn&#39;t a madeup pattern by (30:47 - 30:53)
Niantic it is this was a Gest Pokemon so (30:50 - 30:56)
it was AO Fest that exclusivity has (30:53 - 30:59)
ended now it&#39;s free for everyone (30:56 - 31:02)
granted you log in and you claim it I (30:59 - 31:05)
guess I didn&#39;t realize that they never (31:02 - 31:08)
did that last year after go Fest because (31:05 - 31:11)
usually like right isn&#39;t usually a (31:08 - 31:12)
research will come out for everybody (31:11 - 31:14)
later in later in the year for the (31:12 - 31:17)
mythical that people did a go Fest and I (31:14 - 31:18)
have to look at a calendar this feels a (31:17 - 31:20)
little bit (31:18 - 31:23)
longer it&#39;s usually like in September of (31:20 - 31:25)
that year that go Fest happened that now (31:23 - 31:26)
everybody has the opportunity like with (31:25 - 31:29)
Victini was a go Fest thing and then in (31:26 - 31:32)
like September it was anybody could get (31:29 - 31:36)
the Victini research and get Victini so (31:32 - 31:38)
as definitely I was thinking maybe along (31:36 - 31:42)
the lines of just the leadup to (31:38 - 31:45)
Legends um Za like just CU it&#39;s Kaos and (31:42 - 31:46)
everything so just like the leadup to (31:45 - 31:49)
that maybe there&#39;ll be some things like (31:46 - 31:51)
that but uh I don&#39;t know I just I just (31:49 - 31:56)
thought it was a very weird um time to (31:51 - 31:57)
throw this event out there but to your (31:56 - 31:58)
point like (31:57 - 32:01)
go get your Dany you know like free (31:58 - 32:04)
opportunity just play some Pokemon go (32:01 - 32:07)
which first time in almost 10 years you (32:04 - 32:09)
can join us and complain about the new (32:07 - 32:13)
avatars together when you finally log (32:09 - 32:13)
in you can do it all well (32:13 - 32:21)
um well let&#39;s take a break uh and when (32:18 - 32:22)
we come back we get some scarlet and (32:21 - 32:24)
violet stuff and then we&#39;ll do our (32:22 - 32:27)
Pokemon sleep stuff and we&#39;ll wrap up (32:24 - 32:30)
the show so we will be right back and we (32:27 - 32:32)
are back from our (32:30 - 32:36)
break uh walking wak and iron leaves (32:32 - 32:39)
returns this (32:36 - 32:42)
is technically the third time but the (32:39 - 32:46)
fourth time because it broke yeah oh (32:42 - 32:48)
right okay but it would have been three (32:46 - 32:52)
but they had to like do a makeup event (32:48 - 32:55)
um uh so I believe the last time walking (32:52 - 32:58)
wake in Iron leaves were in raids was (32:55 - 33:00)
over over (32:58 - 33:04)
Christmas uh or around Christmas (33:00 - 33:08)
which was it that long ago I guess so I (33:04 - 33:10)
think so I had to like scroll through my (33:08 - 33:12)
Instagram to see like when&#39;s the last (33:10 - 33:17)
time I posted about this um (33:12 - 33:19)
so obviously there will be repeat raids (33:17 - 33:21)
we had like a repeat Seven Star (33:19 - 33:22)
Charizard I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get repeats of (33:21 - 33:25)
other sevenstar raids (33:22 - 33:27)
um but a lot of people get the game for (33:25 - 33:29)
Christmas (33:27 - 33:31)
and expecting somebody to like plow (33:29 - 33:33)
through the game in a week to get these (33:31 - 33:37)
before they leave is is asking asking a (33:33 - 33:41)
lot of a player but uh I saw a ton of (33:37 - 33:43)
people excited that these were back (33:41 - 33:46)
because they missed it um also like if (33:43 - 33:50)
you have both scarlet and violet you can (33:46 - 33:52)
get both on each copy so you can get two (33:50 - 33:53)
of each (33:52 - 33:57)
technically so might be helpful since (33:53 - 33:59)
these are limited and they will probably (33:57 - 34:02)
remain limited throughout this like life (33:59 - 34:05)
cycle yeah they feel kind of Trapped in (34:02 - 34:08)
raids limited rates mhm yeah this kind (34:05 - 34:11)
of feels like the pole in Ultra Sun (34:08 - 34:14)
Ultra moon like you can get another pole (34:11 - 34:15)
you just got to play through the entire (34:14 - 34:16)
game (34:15 - 34:19)
again uh and these these other alra (34:16 - 34:21)
beasts you can get as many as you want (34:19 - 34:22)
but this (34:21 - 34:26)
pole one one per copy unless you want to (34:22 - 34:28)
start again Bon and stack at attack I (34:26 - 34:30)
were like that too it was that was yeah (34:28 - 34:32)
they gave you two of each you got two of (34:30 - 34:34)
each with those uh that was that was (34:32 - 34:37)
definitely weird I have both scarlet and (34:34 - 34:39)
violet and I think I think I caught my (34:37 - 34:41)
iron leaves in Violet and then my (34:39 - 34:44)
walking awakens in Scarlet like (34:41 - 34:46)
different times so it&#39;s like okay this (34:44 - 34:48)
time I think I got to go and and get one (34:46 - 34:51)
of other versions yeah yeah these are (34:48 - 34:53)
still pretty high up there on the (34:51 - 34:57)
GTS request for trades uh it ends on May (34:53 - 34:59)
6 (34:57 - 35:02)
so started on Thursday April 25th we&#39;ll (34:59 - 35:05)
go until May 6 (35:02 - 35:07)
obviously you got to connect to the (35:05 - 35:09)
internet to get the opposite one I put a (35:07 - 35:12)
whole YouTube video out on two Pokemon (35:09 - 35:14)
you can use to get these they work in (35:12 - 35:18)
both solo and group situations although (35:14 - 35:21)
obviously I can&#39;t hold your hand I can (35:18 - 35:23)
give you the tools I can tell you how to (35:21 - 35:24)
do (35:23 - 35:29)
it um but also very dependent on the (35:24 - 35:30)
players with you right you could have (35:29 - 35:32)
the best raid build in the world and if (35:30 - 35:36)
you line up with Cindy and Cindy brings (35:32 - 35:38)
a level 20 (35:36 - 35:41)
Chimchar you it&#39;s all to lose no matter (35:38 - 35:42)
how good your Pokemon is it&#39;s it&#39;s all (35:41 - 35:45)
to (35:42 - 35:45)
lose uh but they&#39;re they&#39;re not terribly (35:45 - 35:50)
difficult uh our our our Discord has (35:47 - 35:51)
been doing them our slack has been doing (35:50 - 35:55)
them um if you swing by stream I could (35:51 - 35:57)
probably help you if I&#39;m not stuck in (35:55 - 35:59)
another (35:57 - 36:02)
game but yeah uh if you only have a copy (35:59 - 36:05)
of scarlet for example and you want an (36:02 - 36:08)
extra set of walking wake or iron leaves (36:05 - 36:10)
you can make another new profile on your (36:08 - 36:12)
switch you will have to get through the (36:10 - 36:16)
tutorial um which may take you an hour (36:12 - 36:18)
and a half to two hours and then once (36:16 - 36:21)
you&#39;re there uh you can move a Pokemon (36:18 - 36:23)
from your main game into Pokemon home (36:21 - 36:24)
switch (36:23 - 36:28)
over move that into your side account (36:24 - 36:31)
and then it doesn&#39;t matter how many Gym (36:28 - 36:33)
badges you have a Pokemon in a raid will (36:31 - 36:36)
listen to you no matter what uh so then (36:33 - 36:39)
you can get another walking wakes and (36:36 - 36:41)
iron leaves that&#39;s I&#39;m that&#39;s like two (36:39 - 36:45)
hours of extra work uh but if you really (36:41 - 36:48)
want another one that&#39;s technically a (36:45 - 36:50)
free way to do (36:48 - 36:54)
it uh but yeah they&#39;re back look if you (36:50 - 36:56)
don&#39;t get them this (36:54 - 36:58)
weekend I&#39;m sure in another six months (36:56 - 37:01)
they&#39;ll come (36:58 - 37:01)
back and yeah maybe one day maybe one (37:01 - 37:07)
day they&#39;ll be a distribution or (37:05 - 37:08)
something when the shiny that&#39;s the pole (37:07 - 37:10)
was a distribution eventually when the (37:08 - 37:12)
shiny came out or that&#39;s how you got the (37:10 - 37:13)
that you could get a shiny one I guess (37:12 - 37:15)
it wasn&#39;t when the shiny came out but (37:13 - 37:17)
that is how you get a shiny one How (37:15 - 37:19)
Could You Forget the drive to GameStop (37:17 - 37:21)
to get your shiny pole memorable just (37:19 - 37:23)
the conversation I had with the employee (37:21 - 37:26)
that day to get my shiny pole never (37:23 - 37:28)
forget it uh they also released a brand (37:26 - 37:31)
new event uh which was catch Magikarp (37:28 - 37:34)
Shinx roller V room in scarlet and (37:31 - 37:37)
outbreak scarlet and violet mass (37:34 - 37:39)
outbreaks just I&#39;m just skipping words (37:37 - 37:41)
here trying to get through this show as (37:39 - 37:45)
fast as possible um that will also go (37:41 - 37:47)
that&#39;s Thursday the 25th through Monday (37:45 - 37:50)
May 5th uh both Magikarp and verum and (37:47 - 37:55)
is in Pala shins in kakami and reor in (37:50 - 37:58)
blueberry Academy these do have an (37:55 - 38:00)
increased shiny (37:58 - 38:02)
chance whether you have the shiny charm (38:00 - 38:05)
or not um but only for those four (38:02 - 38:08)
Pokemon I named and the theme Here is I (38:05 - 38:10)
believe it&#39;s gold and weak in Japan so (38:08 - 38:12)
these are the Pokemon that are (38:10 - 38:15)
gold when they are shiny so it&#39;s the (38:12 - 38:17)
same as the there&#39;s been like two or (38:15 - 38:20)
three mass outbreaks that have had (38:17 - 38:21)
increased shiny outs it&#39;s either (38:20 - 38:23)
increase shiny odds or increased (38:21 - 38:26)
marks um and I believe the base odds for (38:23 - 38:29)
that are like about one and (38:26 - 38:32)
200 uh without the shiny charm and then (38:29 - 38:35)
it&#39;s like one in (38:32 - 38:38)
75 with I put the I made a graph on (38:35 - 38:41)
Instagram and Twitter there&#39;s a lot of (38:38 - 38:42)
numbers depending on sandwich or not (38:41 - 38:45)
sandwich or outbreak or not outbreak or (38:42 - 38:47)
Charm or not charm (38:45 - 38:51)
um I mean from what I&#39;ve remember during (38:47 - 38:53)
the uh (38:51 - 38:58)
fbe uh was it fbe Fus and (38:53 - 39:03)
something else I Litwick Litwick right (38:58 - 39:05)
and then there was also the Voltorb one (39:03 - 39:07)
as well at one point Fus and volor was (39:05 - 39:10)
like the same oh that&#39;s right okay yes (39:07 - 39:14)
um so I feel like people were saying (39:10 - 39:17)
that the sandwiches you could do it sure (39:14 - 39:19)
but I mean the odds are really good (39:17 - 39:22)
already so maybe not might not be as (39:19 - 39:25)
worth it to use them on on stuff like (39:22 - 39:26)
this versus like if you&#39;re just going (39:25 - 39:28)
and doing like a regular uh Mass (39:26 - 39:31)
outbreak versus these boosted ones um (39:28 - 39:33)
that&#39;s true buta is easier to come by at (39:31 - 39:36)
this point so true there is that yeah (39:33 - 39:38)
but if you&#39;re if you&#39;re limited on it (39:36 - 39:40)
you know it&#39;s like maybe maybe try it a (39:38 - 39:41)
little bit without a sandwich because (39:40 - 39:43)
it&#39;s you know you do have those higher (39:41 - 39:46)
odds to begin with um so it might be not (39:43 - 39:50)
not as necessary as as usual yeah unless (39:46 - 39:52)
you care about big or small or marks (39:50 - 39:54)
then you kind of have to rely on urbom (39:52 - 39:57)
mystica I need my shinies to be as rare (39:54 - 39:58)
as possible (39:57 - 40:03)
clearly my marked humongo shiny is worth (39:58 - 40:08)
more than your non humongo shiny uhhuh y (40:03 - 40:10)
the my my eBay profile just skyrocketing (40:08 - 40:12)
after this (40:10 - 40:17)
event uh I like the here&#39;s a new event (40:12 - 40:19)
but here&#39;s also a repeat event for (40:17 - 40:20)
people who might have missed it not (40:19 - 40:22)
everyone can do every event every (40:20 - 40:24)
weekend um like I was out of town when (40:22 - 40:27)
the Eevee event happened where it was (40:24 - 40:29)
like mass outbreaks of eeve so I didn&#39;t (40:27 - 40:31)
even get like an opportunity not that I (40:29 - 40:33)
need like shiny Eevee but it was like (40:31 - 40:35)
a just out of town when this event (40:33 - 40:38)
happen so I can&#39;t do it so it it was (40:35 - 40:40)
nice to be (40:38 - 40:43)
like I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not gonna I&#39;m not (40:40 - 40:44)
gonna I&#39;m never going to complain like (40:43 - 40:47)
oh man a repeat walking wake why can&#39;t (40:44 - 40:51)
they give us gouging fire or (40:47 - 40:53)
like I get that not everyone can do (40:51 - 40:55)
every event also this is the same (40:53 - 40:57)
company that likes to put every single (40:55 - 40:59)
event every single weekend like ah (40:57 - 41:02)
there&#39;s a new event here and there&#39;s uh (40:59 - 41:05)
a Pokemon go hatch day and there&#39;s uh a (41:02 - 41:08)
seven star raid and also NAIC is this (41:05 - 41:12)
weekend and like I need some breathing (41:08 - 41:14)
room so I do like here&#39;s a new event (41:12 - 41:16)
here&#39;s new Mass outbreak event here&#39;s (41:14 - 41:17)
also a repeat (41:16 - 41:21)
event I think that&#39;s great and I expect (41:17 - 41:23)
that&#39;s probably how the next year is (41:21 - 41:26)
going to play out and forever after that (41:23 - 41:29)
yeah (41:26 - 41:29)
like I I would be curious if they we (41:30 - 41:35)
record these on a Sunday morning and (41:33 - 41:36)
usually Seven Star raids get announced (41:35 - 41:38)
on a Sunday night I would be curious if (41:36 - 41:42)
they announce a sevenstar raid tonight (41:38 - 41:45)
they might but like these two events are (41:42 - 41:48)
still going into this weekend so that (41:45 - 41:51)
would be another event on top of the two (41:48 - 41:53)
events they already (41:51 - 41:55)
have I think there&#39;s enough content I (41:53 - 41:57)
think (41:55 - 42:00)
if they do it like that&#39;s not surprising (41:57 - 42:02)
they like to stack things but I think (42:00 - 42:05)
that&#39;s enough content I yeah I I mean (42:02 - 42:07)
they could announce something but for (42:05 - 42:09)
like two weeks out maybe if they wanted (42:07 - 42:12)
to I don&#39;t think they would they&#39;ve done (42:09 - 42:14)
heads up before of like it&#39;s next week (42:12 - 42:16)
not this week which would be (42:14 - 42:19)
nice um for you to be able to make the (42:16 - 42:21)
content yeah I think that&#39;s I mean like (42:19 - 42:23)
for me like I have so many resources in (42:21 - 42:25)
the game that I I could I can build a (42:23 - 42:28)
Pokemon in 10 minutes (42:25 - 42:30)
um but I think for like I always think (42:28 - 42:32)
of the average player of like thing gets (42:30 - 42:35)
announced on Sunday the raid starts on (42:32 - 42:38)
Thursday like to be like okay drop (42:35 - 42:39)
everything you got to build a new (42:38 - 42:41)
Pokemon so you can do it on Thursday (42:39 - 42:42)
where everyone&#39;s going to be doing it (42:41 - 42:45)
the most and then Friday and then like (42:42 - 42:47)
you know just like raids and other games (42:45 - 42:48)
it&#39;s like if you&#39;re not doing it right (42:47 - 42:52)
away everyone&#39;s moved on or you&#39;re stuck (42:48 - 42:57)
with Cindy and her level 20 Chimchar (42:52 - 42:57)
you&#39;re done for you can&#39;t do (42:57 - 43:00)
it I like mass outbreaks I think I think (43:01 - 43:06)
they&#39;re I think they&#39;re great I think (43:05 - 43:09)
they&#39;re a fun way to play the game for (43:06 - 43:11)
those that don&#39;t like raids but you know (43:09 - 43:14)
I also like raids yeah I definitely fall (43:11 - 43:17)
into the the mass outbreaks Camp more (43:14 - 43:21)
than raids just I like uh the catching (43:17 - 43:22)
more than battling but also yeah if (43:21 - 43:24)
you&#39;re if you don&#39;t have a whole lot of (43:22 - 43:27)
time right there&#39;s not a huge amount of (43:24 - 43:30)
setup or really any setup um with the (43:27 - 43:32)
mass outbreaks versus what you do have (43:30 - 43:33)
to kind of set up with the with the (43:32 - 43:36)
raids although I feel like enough have (43:33 - 43:38)
been done over time that if you&#39;ve been (43:36 - 43:40)
building things over time then you you (43:38 - 43:42)
probably have a decent collection built (43:40 - 43:45)
up for Stuff U doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going (43:42 - 43:49)
to work every time but uh you know it&#39;s (43:45 - 43:51)
been getting people to get collections (43:49 - 43:54)
of level 100 Pokemon builtup which um (43:51 - 43:56)
past games didn&#39;t do in the same way (43:54 - 43:59)
yeah I mean if you&#39;ve been doing all the (43:56 - 44:00)
raids you&#39;re probably in a position (43:59 - 44:02)
where you can build a Pokemon in 10 15 (44:00 - 44:03)
minutes (44:02 - 44:05)
anyways I&#39;m still kind of surprised (44:03 - 44:07)
they&#39;re not doing more mass outbreaks (44:05 - 44:10)
but I&#39;m always happy to see (44:07 - 44:13)
them yeah it seems like what maybe like (44:10 - 44:16)
one a month maybe maybe a little bit (44:13 - 44:18)
less (44:16 - 44:21)
yeah yeah (44:18 - 44:23)
but (44:21 - 44:29)
uh we got what two three two months to (44:23 - 44:29)
NAIC and then 3ish months to (44:29 - 44:36)
Hawaii (44:36 - 44:40)
so do you think things are going to (44:38 - 44:43)
change after that though really I mean (44:40 - 44:44)
especially with like the fact that they (44:43 - 44:47)
didn&#39;t announce a new game for this year (44:44 - 44:51)
or anything so no I I I think the pacing (44:47 - 44:54)
is still on track to be normal new game (44:51 - 44:58)
or not um like we we now have one (44:54 - 45:00)
restricted Legend and that will go into (44:58 - 45:06)
this worlds right MH and next worlds (45:00 - 45:07)
should still be in the scarlet and (45:06 - 45:08)
violet (45:07 - 45:12)
format so to those listening being like (45:08 - 45:13)
what&#39;s going to happen I&#39;m going to tell (45:12 - 45:14)
you what&#39;s going to happen it&#39;s G to be (45:13 - 45:16)
another year of scarlet and violet (45:14 - 45:17)
they&#39;re going to continue doing Seven (45:16 - 45:18)
Star raids they&#39;re going to continue (45:17 - 45:21)
doing mass outbreaks um they did this at (45:18 - 45:23)
the end of sword and shield like we were (45:21 - 45:24)
getting you know different raid events (45:23 - 45:28)
in sword and shield and world&#39;s next (45:24 - 45:32)
year should be two restricted Pokemon (45:28 - 45:34)
because that&#39;s (45:32 - 45:37)
how the end of sun and moon was that was (45:34 - 45:39)
the end of sword and shield was that (45:37 - 45:40)
should be the end of scarlet and violet (45:39 - 45:42)
should be two restricted Pokemon so I (45:40 - 45:43)
could (45:42 - 45:46)
see what what regul we&#39;re regulation G (45:43 - 45:50)
now I think um so regulation G is one (45:46 - 45:53)
restricted Pokemon so I think the ones (45:50 - 45:54)
that (45:53 - 46:00)
are dominant in testing are Shadow karx (45:54 - 46:04)
trapos and I actually think it&#39;s coridon (46:00 - 46:05)
are like the top (46:04 - 46:09)
three um Scarlet continues to win I (46:05 - 46:12)
surprised I a little (46:09 - 46:12)
surprised uh I thought it was going to (46:12 - 46:16)
be maridon uh yeah that&#39;s where I would (46:14 - 46:20)
have thought too but sun is more (46:16 - 46:23)
dominant than electric (46:20 - 46:27)
terrain and I think kidon deals with KY (46:23 - 46:30)
ogre which has been not like deals (46:27 - 46:32)
directly but like you get to shut down (46:30 - 46:35)
its rain right (46:32 - 46:39)
and like water is at least resisted and (46:35 - 46:41)
weakened in the (46:39 - 46:44)
Sun so weather weather has always been (46:41 - 46:46)
strong um but (46:44 - 46:50)
trapos obviously is like the probably (46:46 - 46:55)
similar to zachian here in the sense (46:50 - 46:55)
of uh it&#39;s unique tralization (46:55 - 47:02)
ability and then Shadow Keller X has (47:00 - 47:04)
always (47:02 - 47:05)
been (47:04 - 47:10)
good it&#39;s been it&#39;s been good so uh (47:05 - 47:11)
those are the top three that I saw going (47:10 - 47:13)
around now obviously that can change (47:11 - 47:16)
once ladder opens and people figure out (47:13 - 47:17)
how to make things (47:16 - 47:19)
work (47:17 - 47:22)
um (47:19 - 47:24)
but yeah it&#39;s one restricted and we&#39;ll (47:22 - 47:26)
see the one restricted at Worlds and (47:24 - 47:29)
then after that will be regulation (47:26 - 47:32)
H who knows what regulation H will be I (47:29 - 47:34)
I don&#39;t think regulation H is going to (47:32 - 47:37)
be the okay now here&#39;s your second (47:34 - 47:40)
restricted but they I could I could see (47:37 - 47:43)
them doing like a ban of like hey for (47:40 - 47:44)
these next three months these 10 Pokemon (47:43 - 47:49)
are banned figure it out right um (47:44 - 47:51)
because they have not done a ban season (47:49 - 47:54)
yet and they did at least one band (47:51 - 47:57)
season for (47:54 - 48:00)
Scarlet sword and (47:57 - 48:03)
shield um and I think for sword and (48:00 - 48:05)
shield if I remember correctly they did (48:03 - 48:07)
a season where or they maybe it wasn&#39;t a (48:05 - 48:09)
season maybe it was just like a a (48:07 - 48:11)
tournament where it was like no Dynamax (48:09 - 48:13)
at (48:11 - 48:13)
all that sounds familiar and so I can (48:13 - 48:18)
definitely see them doing a tournament (48:17 - 48:22)
slash a season of like no terization at (48:18 - 48:25)
all which also changes things like I (48:22 - 48:27)
don&#39;t think trapos would be nearly as (48:25 - 48:28)
good if it could not (48:27 - 48:31)
tralize no right (48:28 - 48:33)
right that&#39;s weird when they do (48:31 - 48:34)
something like that because it&#39;s like (48:33 - 48:37)
here&#39;s the the gimmick of the entire (48:34 - 48:40)
series for this time around and then (48:37 - 48:42)
we&#39;re going to remove it we&#39;re going to (48:40 - 48:44)
remove your ability to do it for I guess (48:42 - 48:46)
it&#39;s only if it&#39;s only for like yeah (48:44 - 48:48)
it&#39;s for a limited T tournament it&#39;s (48:46 - 48:50)
just keeping things interesting yeah (48:48 - 48:52)
yeah it is it is always interesting to (48:50 - 48:57)
see like would a Pokemon like a nyap or (48:52 - 49:01)
uh uh walking wake be good in a format (48:57 - 49:05)
where a tralization doesn&#39;t hard counter (49:01 - 49:08)
it (49:05 - 49:08)
like I don&#39;t know who knows but (49:08 - 49:15)
I I I don&#39;t (49:12 - 49:17)
think I don&#39;t know I I guess I don&#39;t (49:15 - 49:19)
know if like people are listening like (49:17 - 49:22)
being like oh maybe Za comes out (49:19 - 49:25)
in (49:22 - 49:28)
the March and that&#39;s going to be the (49:25 - 49:30)
world&#39;s game for next like I don&#39;t think (49:28 - 49:31)
that I don&#39;t think anyone thinks that (49:30 - 49:34)
like I okay I would be surprised if that (49:31 - 49:36)
game has any sense of competitive right (49:34 - 49:39)
at all that&#39;s my was my thing I do think (49:36 - 49:41)
I&#39;m I&#39;m in the camp of maybe this game (49:39 - 49:44)
comes out in q1 of 2025 similar to how (49:41 - 49:47)
Legends arus came out in q1 of (49:44 - 49:52)
2022 I believe uh so I&#39;m I&#39;m in that (49:47 - 49:54)
camp but I don&#39;t think that it would (49:52 - 49:57)
have any uh (49:54 - 50:00)
competitive part to it I I think that it (49:57 - 50:02)
would be I mean who knows what we&#39;ve (50:00 - 50:04)
seen as what we&#39;ve seen from this so far (50:02 - 50:06)
but I sort of think it won&#39;t I think it (50:04 - 50:09)
will be Scarlet Violet through next year (50:06 - 50:11)
and Legend Za won&#39;t have any effect on (50:09 - 50:13)
the competitive side yeah we&#39;re still (50:11 - 50:16)
figuring out what a Legends game is but (50:13 - 50:19)
it doesn&#39;t seem to be a battle focused (50:16 - 50:21)
thing (50:19 - 50:23)
y you know I just want to point out that (50:21 - 50:25)
both let&#39;s go Pikachu and Eevee and (50:23 - 50:28)
legends archus they both have mass (50:25 - 50:30)
release Here We Go just just want to (50:28 - 50:32)
point that out (50:30 - 50:35)
there uh switching over to (50:32 - 50:38)
Pokemon Pokemon (50:35 - 50:43)
sleep ente is arriving in late May uh (50:38 - 50:45)
you can exchange samples of ente main (50:43 - 50:48)
that you collect for an ente incense in (50:45 - 50:50)
which you can research various sleep (50:48 - 50:53)
Styles it is a fire type helper Pokemon (50:50 - 50:55)
so we recommend raising your fire type (50:53 - 50:57)
Pokemon to get ready (50:55 - 50:59)
there&#39;s not a lot of fire type Pokemon (50:57 - 51:01)
in this game now you might think like oh (50:59 - 51:03)
Hound hour nope that&#39;s considered a dark (51:01 - 51:06)
type that does not count as your fire (51:03 - 51:09)
type uh you have Charmander line you (51:06 - 51:11)
have the growth line you have the syndic (51:09 - 51:13)
Quil line and you have Flareon you have (51:11 - 51:16)
really ultimately four options as fire (51:13 - 51:20)
type Pokemon in this game um and after (51:16 - 51:23)
they announced ente they announced that (51:20 - 51:26)
Vulpix was coming to Pokemon sleep so (51:23 - 51:29)
you gone from four options to five (51:26 - 51:32)
[Laughter] (51:29 - 51:36)
options not a whole lot here (51:32 - 51:40)
um they also said that ente will be (51:36 - 51:43)
coming to Green Grass which is not a (51:40 - 51:45)
surprise uh although a lot of fire type (51:43 - 51:49)
Pokemon come to top Hollow uh I (51:45 - 51:53)
don&#39;t I think I would like to see you (51:49 - 51:55)
have an option of (51:53 - 51:58)
picking to like oh I want to do ente on (51:55 - 52:00)
topalo or I want to do ente on green (51:58 - 52:01)
grass I don&#39;t think that would be bad (52:00 - 52:03)
but I think the reality is this is just (52:01 - 52:05)
probably just going to be green grass (52:03 - 52:08)
yeah just likeo I was thinking like if (52:05 - 52:10)
they do ever open that up to where a (52:08 - 52:13)
legendary would be on multiple in (52:10 - 52:15)
multiple places I think it would be (52:13 - 52:17)
after they finish the beasts so I think (52:15 - 52:19)
ente and suun would both just be green (52:17 - 52:20)
grass and then if they wanted to change (52:19 - 52:22)
it up I think it would be after they do (52:20 - 52:24)
those but I just I didn&#39;t think that (52:22 - 52:28)
like ente or suun would be available in (52:24 - 52:30)
in multiple (52:28 - 52:33)
locations yeah it&#39;s just like the whole (52:30 - 52:35)
point not the whole point but a big (52:33 - 52:37)
selling point to Legends is to bring (52:35 - 52:42)
like new people to your game and if it&#39;s (52:37 - 52:44)
not on the most accessible starting (52:42 - 52:47)
Island then like even if you gave like (52:44 - 52:50)
those people a heads up yeah like that&#39;s (52:47 - 52:52)
still be on both though yeah it could (52:50 - 52:54)
still be on both yeah it could be on (52:52 - 52:56)
both but for this particular event for (52:54 - 52:59)
the one they specifically say that they (52:56 - 53:02)
are preparing some functions and rewards (52:59 - 53:04)
that will allow everyone even Pokemon (53:02 - 53:06)
sleep beginners to research ent&#39;s sleep (53:04 - 53:08)
Styles and befriend it so they are (53:06 - 53:11)
outright directly saying that beginners (53:08 - 53:13)
will be able to get it this time hey (53:11 - 53:16)
they did say that for raicho as well and (53:13 - 53:19)
Bobby got a (53:16 - 53:21)
Reiko I did I did I so I guess the (53:19 - 53:24)
question now is you know the fire type (53:21 - 53:27)
week is going to happen but but it&#39;s not (53:24 - 53:30)
yet so like this coming you know for (53:27 - 53:31)
everyone listening right it&#39;s like the (53:30 - 53:33)
first day of the week (53:31 - 53:38)
so is the move to go to topollo prior to (53:33 - 53:40)
that to get that like I&#39;m newer right so (53:38 - 53:43)
I I don&#39;t have much on anything at this (53:40 - 53:44)
point like I&#39;ve been to Green Grass the (53:43 - 53:46)
only time I&#39;ve been to Greengrass was (53:44 - 53:48)
for raicho it was like the first week I (53:46 - 53:51)
had to be there and then the Reiko event (53:48 - 53:53)
and then since then just been to other (53:51 - 53:54)
places so I haven&#39;t actually even (53:53 - 53:57)
visited Greengrass again since since the (53:54 - 54:01)
raicho event so blessed for me so (53:57 - 54:03)
actually I still don&#39;t know the music of (54:01 - 54:04)
green grass because I wasn&#39;t listening (54:03 - 54:07)
to any of it on the music prior to cion (54:04 - 54:10)
beach um which and the raicho event had (54:07 - 54:13)
different music it did it did yeah never (54:10 - 54:16)
hear that mus again no see this is the (54:13 - 54:18)
thing that I&#39;m learning now so I will (54:16 - 54:21)
say after going back to cyan Beach I (54:18 - 54:24)
really miss the music of topollo like (54:21 - 54:27)
that that music wins out for me uh it&#39;s (54:24 - 54:30)
very good Hannah you were correct it is (54:27 - 54:33)
better than fantastic music it is good (54:30 - 54:37)
is great it is great um but yeah so part (54:33 - 54:38)
of me is like well I should go to green (54:37 - 54:40)
grass so I get the musical experience of (54:38 - 54:43)
green grass since I haven&#39;t had it yet (54:40 - 54:46)
uh but and the other part of me is like (54:43 - 54:48)
but I miss that topalo music they need (54:46 - 54:51)
to just have a soundtrack released so I (54:48 - 54:55)
can do listen to this all the time uh (54:51 - 54:57)
it&#39;s they keep adding in relaxing sleep (54:55 - 54:58)
sounds but what we really want to listen (54:57 - 55:03)
to is the Pokemon sleep music itself yes (54:58 - 55:07)
yes um for for the fire type week that (55:03 - 55:10)
will start well this podcast comes out (55:07 - 55:13)
on the 29th so that will start next week (55:10 - 55:16)
on Monday May (55:13 - 55:19)
6 uh and that was if you would like to (55:16 - 55:21)
prepare for the ente event during the (55:19 - 55:23)
fire type Pokémon fire type Pokemon will (55:21 - 55:25)
be helpful we encourage you to be friend (55:23 - 55:27)
lots of fire type Pokémon dur during (55:25 - 55:28)
this event you&#39;ll be able to meet (55:27 - 55:30)
Pokémon of various sleep types (55:28 - 55:32)
regardless of your own which is helpful (55:30 - 55:33)
cuz a lot of fire type Pokémon are (55:32 - 55:35)
behind like snoozing or something which (55:33 - 55:39)
is like the hardest sleep style to get (55:35 - 55:40)
uh fire type Pokemon will be more likely (55:39 - 55:43)
to appear during this event you&#39;ll be (55:40 - 55:46)
able to get a mini candy boost function (55:43 - 55:48)
which doubles the effects of your candy (55:46 - 55:49)
it&#39;s a great opportunity to raise your (55:48 - 55:52)
fire type Pokemon uh in addition one (55:49 - 55:55)
Pokemon that visits will be hungry for (55:52 - 55:58)
sure this supplies once per day this is (55:55 - 56:00)
a separate effect from for incense or (55:58 - 56:01)
good camp (56:00 - 56:06)
tickets um on top of that uh you will (56:01 - 56:09)
get rewarded a Vulpix incense through (56:06 - 56:11)
limited time (56:09 - 56:15)
missions so they are they are saying (56:11 - 56:17)
that if you go to green grass you will (56:15 - 56:20)
have a higher type appearance of (56:17 - 56:23)
Charmander Charmeleon Vulpix Ninetails (56:20 - 56:26)
scow Flareon syil quava tyion if you go (56:23 - 56:29)
to Canan Beach you will only get (56:26 - 56:32)
Growlithe that&#39;s it nothing (56:29 - 56:35)
else there&#39;s no charmanders there&#39;s no (56:32 - 56:37)
Flareon there&#39;s no Vulpix if for (56:35 - 56:38)
whatever reason you were the one (56:37 - 56:42)
listener being like I need grow s Peach (56:38 - 56:45)
is for you he growth and only (56:42 - 56:48)
growth uh if you go to topalo it&#39;ll be (56:45 - 56:49)
Charmander Charmeleon Charizard Vulpix (56:48 - 56:53)
growth uh Arcanine is added you can get (56:49 - 56:55)
Arcanine on topalo Flareon (56:53 - 56:57)
syndol lava (56:55 - 56:59)
tyion and then they don&#39;t list the other (56:57 - 57:03)
Islands so you have three (56:59 - 57:05)
choices I think for a lot of people the (57:03 - 57:10)
better choice is probably green grass uh (57:05 - 57:12)
because if your top Hollow is like a 0% (57:10 - 57:16)
or a 5% and your green grass is like a (57:12 - 57:18)
45 or a 50 or 55 you probably want to go (57:16 - 57:25)
to green grass to level that up um but I (57:18 - 57:27)
don&#39;t know if I was like Bobby (57:25 - 57:29)
I would start topala this week and see (57:27 - 57:33)
if you like it or at least increase (57:29 - 57:36)
it but there&#39;s such (57:33 - 57:38)
a difficulty difference between green (57:36 - 57:39)
grass and (57:38 - 57:42)
topalo without like that percentage (57:39 - 57:44)
boost behind you but like you said Bobby (57:42 - 57:46)
you don&#39;t have like a huge percentage (57:44 - 57:50)
boost for green grass right that&#39;s the (57:46 - 57:51)
other thing I don&#39;t have a huge (57:50 - 57:52)
percentage of boost for green grass I (57:51 - 57:55)
guess I do a little more because I did (57:52 - 57:59)
do three weeks of green grass right so (57:55 - 58:01)
yeah because of the it was the the first (57:59 - 58:02)
week you have to and then it was two (58:01 - 58:04)
weeks of the raicho event that I was on (58:02 - 58:07)
green grass so I did that initial three (58:04 - 58:09)
weeks there um and then I think I&#39;ve (58:07 - 58:11)
been like one week at Canan beach one (58:09 - 58:13)
week at topalo and now second week at (58:11 - 58:15)
San Beach so (58:13 - 58:20)
um I don&#39;t know figure it out for for uh (58:15 - 58:22)
what to do but I am excited about the (58:20 - 58:25)
fire type week um I do think it&#39;s funny (58:22 - 58:27)
that they like you said they don&#39;t note (58:25 - 58:31)
um uh snow drop or lapis in there but (58:27 - 58:33)
then later in there they literally are (58:31 - 58:36)
telling you like none of the greater (58:33 - 58:38)
appearance Pokemon are going to be at (58:36 - 58:41)
snow drop tundra or lapis like side so (58:38 - 58:43)
like if you want any of them please do (58:41 - 58:46)
not go there for fire a week um but (58:43 - 58:48)
which I don&#39;t even have either of those (58:46 - 58:49)
yet for my sleep because I don&#39;t have (58:48 - 58:53)
enough sleep Styles unlocked but um (58:49 - 58:55)
should be good I was saying this on my (58:53 - 58:56)
twitch stream I think like literally (58:55 - 58:58)
yesterday oh also I&#39;ll be doing a (58:56 - 59:00)
marathon on Twitch starting on Wednesday (58:58 - 59:03)
night and throughout the week so that (59:00 - 59:06)
will involve older Pokemon games and (59:03 - 59:08)
Pokemon sleep and ideally it&#39;s supposed (59:06 - 59:10)
to be a 72-hour Marathon so just a (59:08 - 59:12)
there&#39;s your public service announcement (59:10 - 59:13)
but this is what I was saying the other (59:12 - 59:16)
day I think the problem with the other (59:13 - 59:20)
islands is they&#39;re not unique (59:16 - 59:24)
enough to like green grass like this is (59:20 - 59:26)
a good example they&#39;re like on topal you (59:24 - 59:28)
can get Charmander you get Charmeleon (59:26 - 59:29)
you get Vulpix you get Growlithe you get (59:28 - 59:31)
flare all of those Pokemon are also on (59:29 - 59:34)
green grass like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s (59:31 - 59:35)
because there&#39;s just not enough Pokemon (59:34 - 59:38)
in Pokemon sleep but that&#39;s why it&#39;s (59:35 - 59:41)
it&#39;s like well why do I want to go to (59:38 - 59:43)
topalo well I need (59:41 - 59:45)
like Steelix and (59:43 - 59:48)
Onyx and I need like a syndic Quil but (59:45 - 59:50)
syndic Quil is also hard to get because (59:48 - 59:51)
it&#39;s like behind snoozing I think it&#39;s (59:50 - 59:55)
behind snoozing I could be wrong um but (59:51 - 59:56)
it&#39;s like when I go there it&#39;s like (59:55 - 59:59)
giodude and Crow Gunk and a bunch of (59:56 - 60:01)
other Pokemon that I don&#39;t really need (59:59 - 60:02)
and like I&#39;m on the beach right now you (60:01 - 60:05)
know what I woke up to like three Crow (60:02 - 60:07)
Gunk like I don&#39;t want more Kow gunk in (60:05 - 60:08)
topalo (60:07 - 60:12)
either like I just kind of wish that (60:08 - 60:13)
like I get why green grass has (60:12 - 60:15)
everything it&#39;s like the starter Island (60:13 - 60:18)
it needs a lot of things but I do (60:15 - 60:20)
wish that (60:18 - 60:23)
more and maybe it gets better with time (60:20 - 60:26)
where like the things I see on topalo or (60:23 - 60:28)
the things I see on the beach is just (60:26 - 60:31)
not like everything from green grass in (60:28 - 60:35)
just like a different way right so when (60:31 - 60:38)
new Pokemon come out do they not then go (60:35 - 60:40)
to a specific place after they&#39;re you (60:38 - 60:43)
know so like comy right now it were just (60:40 - 60:45)
released this week right and you can get (60:43 - 60:49)
it on cyan Beach or green grass or lapis (60:45 - 60:52)
or lapis but once the once this comfy (60:49 - 60:55)
event is over will it not just be (60:52 - 60:56)
exclusive to (60:55 - 60:58)
and Lapis or something like that it&#39;ll (60:56 - 61:01)
still be on green (60:58 - 61:01)
grass uh I don&#39;t know if K will (61:01 - 61:07)
permanently be on green grass after I (61:05 - 61:10)
think I thought I saw them say it will (61:07 - 61:12)
only be Beach and (61:10 - 61:14)
Lapis I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll be the first (61:12 - 61:16)
time they&#39;ve done that no they did that (61:14 - 61:21)
for Dratini and Ralts and Stuffle where (61:16 - 61:23)
they were on Green Grass and then they (61:21 - 61:25)
were specifically those three Pokemon (61:23 - 61:27)
are specifically only lapis now right (61:25 - 61:30)
and then Den is Green Grass and (61:27 - 61:32)
Lapis which like sucks as somebody who (61:30 - 61:35)
wants a den and it&#39;s like I was on Beach (61:32 - 61:36)
this week and now I&#39;m going to be on (61:35 - 61:39)
topalo for two some weeks so it&#39;s like (61:36 - 61:41)
literally almost a full month of like (61:39 - 61:44)
I&#39;m just not going to get another Den (61:41 - 61:47)
because I like why would I go to green (61:44 - 61:48)
grass I&#39;m going to have to go to green (61:47 - 61:51)
grass for ente but like I have no reason (61:48 - 61:55)
to go to green grass now right so when (61:51 - 61:57)
you one question I did have when you (61:55 - 62:00)
switch um islands like in in the middle (61:57 - 62:03)
of the week does it also start this it&#39;s (62:00 - 62:05)
like cuz it&#39;s a new Snorlax right so it (62:03 - 62:08)
starts all that over right and people do (62:05 - 62:12)
that like yeah some people I guess must (62:08 - 62:14)
be usually I feel like if you&#39;re using (62:12 - 62:17)
the island switching it&#39;s right at the (62:14 - 62:18)
beginning to (62:17 - 62:23)
roll uh you also you could also Island (62:18 - 62:26)
switch at the end of the week so on like (62:23 - 62:28)
Sunday night you could just accept that (62:26 - 62:31)
like your final spawns are not going to (62:28 - 62:35)
matter mhm and you could swap to like (62:31 - 62:37)
lapis at the end of the week and then (62:35 - 62:39)
you just get basic L lapis spawns on (62:37 - 62:44)
Monday but you get the 5% boost to lapis (62:39 - 62:47)
oh yep wow okay so my lapis is at like (62:44 - 62:50)
30% but it&#39;s cuz I Island swapped like (62:47 - 62:51)
three (62:50 - 62:54)
times at the very end of the week I was (62:51 - 62:55)
like well I&#39;m on Green Grass and my (62:54 - 62:57)
green grass is at 55 so I could either (62:55 - 62:59)
accept like I&#39;m going to wake up to five (62:57 - 63:01)
igly Buffs in five ekin cuz it&#39;s green (62:59 - 63:04)
grass or I can just cut the losses wake (63:01 - 63:07)
up to like four Pokemon on lapis but I (63:04 - 63:10)
end lapis at a 5% boost so then you (63:07 - 63:12)
don&#39;t get the 5 per boost for the first (63:10 - 63:13)
island you were on then right or no it&#39;s (63:12 - 63:15)
only it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s Sunday and Monday is (63:13 - 63:18)
what determines the 5% boost I see I see (63:15 - 63:19)
I see okay got (63:18 - 63:22)
it so trick You&#39; also do that like (63:19 - 63:25)
during the ente thing too is like again (63:22 - 63:27)
my lap my green grass is at 55 so when I (63:25 - 63:30)
end the week there I get no boost so I (63:27 - 63:32)
could just accept (63:30 - 63:34)
like (63:32 - 63:37)
okay I I either I I get some spawns in (63:34 - 63:39)
the morning and don&#39;t get a 5% or I move (63:37 - 63:43)
last minute get whatever garbage spawns (63:39 - 63:47)
on lapis or snow snow drop and and get a (63:43 - 63:49)
5% there but doesn&#39;t it cost money I (63:47 - 63:52)
mean it costs like diamonds or points to (63:49 - 63:55)
do that one cheaper one per month I (63:52 - 63:57)
believe yeah one really inexpensive (63:55 - 64:01)
ticket okay 100 points once per (63:57 - 64:02)
month (64:01 - 64:06)
okay got it just really Min maxing (64:02 - 64:09)
Pokemon sleep here yeah this game is so (64:06 - 64:11)
Good by the (64:09 - 64:11)
way (64:13 - 64:18)
um the mini candy boost if you&#39;ve never (64:15 - 64:19)
done that (64:18 - 64:23)
before that is where your Pokemon will (64:19 - 64:27)
get twice the amount of XP per candy but (64:23 - 64:29)
it will in exchange for four times the (64:27 - 64:31)
amount of dream (64:29 - 64:31)
shards I think this is really good for (64:32 - 64:39)
Pokemon up to maybe like 20 to 25 I (64:35 - 64:42)
think if you have like a level 40 level (64:39 - 64:44)
30 Pokemon I don&#39;t think you should be (64:42 - 64:47)
using your mini candy boost on those (64:44 - 64:51)
Pokemon because dream shards accelerate (64:47 - 64:54)
in such a high way when you get higher (64:51 - 64:57)
and higher so like there&#39;s a huge (64:54 - 64:58)
difference of (64:57 - 65:01)
like this will cost you 200 dream shards (64:58 - 65:03)
to jump five level from like level like (65:01 - 65:06)
five to level 10 like 200 dream shards (65:03 - 65:07)
but because it&#39;s four times that&#39;s 800 (65:06 - 65:09)
dream shards which is like still not (65:07 - 65:13)
that bad versus like level 40 to (65:09 - 65:19)
45 is like 40,000 dream shards times (65:13 - 65:23)
four so I I would use the mini candy (65:19 - 65:26)
boost personally I would use that on (65:23 - 65:29)
like oh I just got a brand new syndic (65:26 - 65:32)
Quil he&#39;s level seven this is the one I (65:29 - 65:34)
want to bring up to a tyan like focus on (65:32 - 65:38)
that don&#39;t focus on your like level 45 (65:34 - 65:40)
wall (65:38 - 65:42)
rain like it&#39;s just G to be too (65:40 - 65:45)
expensive for Mr walin um so that&#39;s how (65:42 - 65:46)
you use the mini candy boost and you can (65:45 - 65:51)
do 50 a day so if you are working on a (65:46 - 65:52)
syndic Quil be like okay I&#39;m going to do (65:51 - 65:54)
my 50 today on the syndic Quil tomorrow (65:52 - 65:56)
I&#39;m going to do my 50 on the syndic Quil (65:54 - 65:58)
than my assuming you have that much (65:56 - 66:00)
squil candy I was gonna say you have to (65:58 - 66:04)
have candy right so keep that in keep (66:00 - 66:06)
that in mind when you&#39;re doing doing (66:04 - 66:09)
that (66:06 - 66:12)
um we don&#39;t know what Vulpix does (66:09 - 66:14)
yet (66:12 - 66:18)
uh I know Flareon increases your pot (66:14 - 66:21)
size Charizard gets you (66:18 - 66:26)
ingredients and Arcanine is helper (66:21 - 66:28)
and then what was the last tyion is (66:26 - 66:31)
Barry finding do they have this is a (66:28 - 66:33)
weird question do they have odish in the (66:31 - 66:37)
game no okay I&#39;m just thinking of like (66:33 - 66:39)
other Pokemon that are kind of (66:37 - 66:41)
associated with so like growth and (66:39 - 66:44)
Vulpix right bell sprout and Oddish um (66:41 - 66:46)
oh I see I was wondering if like those (66:44 - 66:49)
maybe had similar if they had a similar (66:46 - 66:53)
skill or if if it was just completely (66:49 - 66:53)
random um (66:54 - 67:00)
I don&#39;t maybe like energy for everyone (66:57 - 67:02)
for (67:00 - 67:05)
Vulpix that would potentially make sense (67:02 - 67:08)
that would make more sense for Al for (67:05 - 67:10)
alolan Vulpix I feel like but because (67:08 - 67:12)
it&#39;s fairy (67:10 - 67:14)
yeah we already have Fair energy for (67:12 - 67:16)
everyone (67:14 - 67:19)
though it&#39;s what igly buff is Right igly (67:16 - 67:21)
buff is energ I guess we I guess like (67:19 - 67:24)
Sylvan is also fairy energy for everyone (67:21 - 67:27)
yeah yeah it&#39;s not even they&#39;re still (67:24 - 67:30)
figuring this out (67:27 - 67:33)
right I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that Vulpix (67:30 - 67:36)
would be what Den&#39;s ability is I feel (67:33 - 67:39)
like if they were introduced like a torl (67:36 - 67:42)
or a toonator I don&#39;t know for some (67:39 - 67:46)
reason I feel like pot chance percentage (67:42 - 67:48)
they would keep that towards a Pokemon (67:46 - 67:49)
that doesn&#39;t (67:48 - 67:52)
evolve (67:49 - 67:54)
yeah that would make sense to me but (67:52 - 67:57)
also don&#39;t know why Turtles would help (67:54 - 68:01)
increase your pot size (67:57 - 68:04)
um a lot of fire Turtles on the (68:01 - 68:07)
[Laughter] (68:04 - 68:09)
mind is there another Pokemon that has (68:07 - 68:14)
arcanine&#39;s ability of like helping (68:09 - 68:14)
boost I cuz it&#39;s definitely not going to (68:15 - 68:20)
be that then (68:18 - 68:24)
right we can&#39;t assume for sure right but (68:20 - 68:26)
that would just be weird that two (68:24 - 68:28)
Pokemon would have like a helping boost (68:26 - 68:30)
thing when there are so few of them (68:28 - 68:32)
already yeah that&#39;s what that&#39;s what I&#39;m (68:30 - 68:35)
say I guess that&#39;s what I was wondering (68:32 - 68:37)
if they if they&#39;ve done that past (68:35 - 68:39)
because growth and Vulpix are always (68:37 - 68:40)
paired together that they would have (68:39 - 68:42)
like similar abilities cuz they were (68:40 - 68:43)
like the what the red and (68:42 - 68:45)
blue back in the day like the red and (68:43 - 68:47)
blue exclusives right so they always (68:45 - 68:49)
kind of pair them together yeah I feel (68:47 - 68:50)
like I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be (68:49 - 68:53)
like a new ability cuz I think when they (68:50 - 68:54)
were hyping up to (68:53 - 68:57)
den for for (68:54 - 69:00)
raicho they were very much hyping up (68:57 - 69:01)
that Den would have a new (69:00 - 69:04)
ability (69:01 - 69:07)
yeah what&#39;s arcanine&#39;s ability again it (69:04 - 69:09)
you said it&#39;s like it&#39;s like helping (69:07 - 69:11)
times four I think I don&#39;t know what (69:09 - 69:14)
it&#39;s called it&#39;s called extra (69:11 - 69:18)
helpful extra helpful that seems like a (69:14 - 69:22)
pretty good ability yeah or pretty (69:18 - 69:26)
good like raicho was but (69:22 - 69:28)
only for a single Pokemon and any (69:26 - 69:31)
Pokemon oh okay got it got it got it (69:28 - 69:33)
okay it&#39;s it&#39;s hard for the random (69:31 - 69:35)
abilities to be good because they&#39;re (69:33 - 69:38)
random yeah (69:35 - 69:43)
so like they they they buffed slow King (69:38 - 69:46)
and slow bro they like made them get (69:43 - 69:50)
like slow bro got like a (69:46 - 69:50)
1.3 pretty much got like a 30% (69:50 - 69:54)
ingredient boost and then slow King got (69:52 - 69:55)
like a 10% ingredient boost and then (69:54 - 69:57)
they (69:55 - 69:59)
changed that they like work slightly (69:57 - 70:02)
faster uh spoiler slow King is still bad (69:59 - 70:04)
like I I I I will stay I will stand on (70:02 - 70:06)
this soap box and say I have what I (70:04 - 70:08)
think is one of the best possible onp (70:06 - 70:11)
paper slow Kings and it is awful I was (70:08 - 70:13)
on beach all week and I just got rid I (70:11 - 70:15)
just removed him from my team I was like (70:13 - 70:17)
I&#39;m getting more help from like a Gengar (70:15 - 70:18)
who doesn&#39;t even match the beach stuff (70:17 - 70:21)
you like it&#39;s just bad like there is (70:18 - 70:24)
this weird thing where like Pokemon like (70:21 - 70:25)
look good I think people learn this sort (70:24 - 70:28)
of raicho like on like on paper raicho (70:25 - 70:30)
looked like it would be okay and then in (70:28 - 70:33)
execution raicho wasn&#39;t really that good (70:30 - 70:36)
I think on paper like uh Arcanine like (70:33 - 70:40)
looks okay but I I&#39;ve never really seen (70:36 - 70:41)
beneficial like I&#39;ve never really seen (70:40 - 70:43)
like oh man my team killed it this week (70:41 - 70:45)
because I had Arcanine like my team (70:43 - 70:47)
kills it when I have Den it doesn&#39;t (70:45 - 70:50)
matter what island I&#39;m on and my Den is (70:47 - 70:53)
not even good but like Den is so busted (70:50 - 70:55)
good (70:53 - 70:58)
it&#39;s just like and and again I have like (70:55 - 71:01)
this like perfect slow King and he&#39;s (70:58 - 71:03)
absolute garbage and I have this (71:01 - 71:06)
mediocre den and he&#39;s hard caring my (71:03 - 71:08)
team (71:06 - 71:11)
like sometimes like the the the numbers (71:08 - 71:13)
or what like they lay out for you is (71:11 - 71:15)
just (71:13 - 71:18)
not it kind of reminds me of like VGC (71:15 - 71:20)
players who like live in (71:18 - 71:21)
spreadsheets and they&#39;re like I&#39;ve (71:20 - 71:24)
calculated the perfect tinglu build and (71:21 - 71:26)
it&#39;s like okay but have you tried it (71:24 - 71:29)
they&#39;re like well I don&#39;t need to I like (71:26 - 71:31)
no but like go out and like use it I (71:29 - 71:32)
would encou what I&#39;m what I&#39;m saying is (71:31 - 71:35)
I encourage you just like try different (71:32 - 71:37)
things like just because like your (71:35 - 71:39)
calculator said it like the s-rank (71:37 - 71:42)
Pokemon if it just doesn&#39;t fit your team (71:39 - 71:44)
or the way you play Then is it really (71:42 - 71:47)
srank if you&#39;re not using it the way you (71:44 - 71:50)
should be using it I me that&#39;s true and (71:47 - 71:51)
now I want to go to green grass if (71:50 - 71:53)
there&#39;s I mean it&#39;s only like a slight (71:51 - 71:55)
chance of den though right Den is like a (71:53 - 71:56)
rare (71:55 - 71:58)
mhm the D on green grass doesn&#39;t start (71:56 - 72:02)
appearing I think until Ultra one oh (71:58 - 72:03)
okay but that&#39;s my only option right (72:02 - 72:06)
because it&#39;s on lapis yeah yep okay I&#39;ve (72:03 - 72:09)
never seen it on lapis I think on lapis (72:06 - 72:11)
it starts appearing at like great three (72:09 - 72:12)
or great (72:11 - 72:15)
four I&#39;ve never gotten to Pier you go to (72:12 - 72:16)
lapis if you want bell sprout because (72:15 - 72:19)
that&#39;s all that dial is giving me is (72:16 - 72:21)
bell sprout getting his Bells Sprout (72:19 - 72:24)
this week well lapis has more it&#39;s bell (72:21 - 72:26)
sprout and weeping bell every where this (72:24 - 72:29)
week I mean there is an event going on (72:26 - 72:32)
for that that&#39;s true still it&#39;s just (72:29 - 72:35)
like I don&#39;t need you know it&#39;s like it (72:32 - 72:38)
was I think I had you know seven Pokemon (72:35 - 72:40)
appear or something the other day like (72:38 - 72:42)
five of them were bell sprout or weeping (72:40 - 72:45)
Bell just a little (72:42 - 72:47)
variety also why I brought up slow bro (72:45 - 72:51)
and slow King is they slow I think they (72:47 - 72:54)
both have the same ability um maybe it&#39;s (72:51 - 72:56)
slow bro where they&#39;re ability is they (72:54 - 73:00)
will give energy to a random Pokemon (72:56 - 73:02)
which isn&#39;t very helpful but I think (73:00 - 73:05)
they changed it when they buffed them to (73:02 - 73:08)
say it will more likely give energy to (73:05 - 73:12)
the lowest energy Pokemon which is more (73:08 - 73:15)
helpful but that ability would be way (73:12 - 73:18)
better if it was just will give energy (73:15 - 73:20)
to lowest energy Pokemon because there (73:18 - 73:23)
are some Pokemon that just use more (73:20 - 73:25)
energy than others and again you (73:23 - 73:27)
wouldn&#39;t know that unless one you sat in (73:25 - 73:30)
a calculator and you were doing all that (73:27 - 73:31)
and if you were s sitting in a (73:30 - 73:32)
calculator doing all that you wouldn&#39;t (73:31 - 73:34)
be listening to this podcast and having (73:32 - 73:35)
Pokemon sleep questions right like you (73:34 - 73:37)
would be like living in that (73:35 - 73:41)
calculator and and two (73:37 - 73:44)
um it would give you the option to like (73:41 - 73:47)
change your team more being like okay (73:44 - 73:50)
well I have the slow King I Have a (73:47 - 73:53)
Sylveon Sylveon gives energy to everyone (73:50 - 73:56)
slow King will give energy to the (73:53 - 73:59)
lowest energy Pokemon my wall rain just (73:56 - 74:01)
happens to use more energy than anything (73:59 - 74:03)
so the Synergy here makes sense because (74:01 - 74:05)
the slow King&#39;s going to Target the wall (74:03 - 74:07)
rain the sylveon&#39;s going to do it for (74:05 - 74:08)
everyone now everyone&#39;s going to be (74:07 - 74:10)
healthy it&#39;s just that like amount of (74:08 - 74:13)
Randomness doesn&#39;t make it as good is if (74:10 - 74:17)
like slow King gives energy to something (74:13 - 74:18)
that already has full energy right like (74:17 - 74:21)
there are Pokemon like Victory Bell (74:18 - 74:24)
which gives energy to itself and so it (74:21 - 74:25)
stays healthy on its own so like slow (74:24 - 74:28)
King giving energy to Victory Bell is (74:25 - 74:30)
useless (74:28 - 74:33)
um so I don&#39;t think Arcanine would ever (74:30 - 74:37)
be that good because you can&#39;t (74:33 - 74:41)
control where it&#39;s going (74:37 - 74:45)
MH um but I don&#39;t know how to fix (74:41 - 74:48)
that (74:45 - 74:48)
like maybe there just I mean there&#39;s (74:49 - 74:54)
just Pokemon that aren&#39;t as good to use (74:51 - 74:57)
right I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s every right (74:54 - 74:58)
how many Pokemon in Pokemon go did (74:57 - 75:01)
people say uh this just Dex filler this (74:58 - 75:03)
just Dex filler like week after week (75:01 - 75:05)
with all the like legendaries that would (75:03 - 75:06)
come out and things like that and then (75:05 - 75:08)
the game changes in some way and all of (75:06 - 75:12)
a sudden those Dex filler Pokemon are (75:08 - 75:15)
like highly wanted Pokemon right like (75:12 - 75:17)
the Reggie like Reggie steel I feel like (75:15 - 75:19)
was a long time oh Dex filler like when (75:17 - 75:21)
right when it first came out with raids (75:19 - 75:24)
and then all of a sudden it was like PVP (75:21 - 75:26)
and everybody&#39;s like you have a Reggie (75:24 - 75:27)
steel like oh I need to trade you for (75:26 - 75:28)
Reggie steel it&#39;s like Oh I thought this (75:27 - 75:30)
was just Dex filler thought it was just (75:28 - 75:32)
Dex filler huh I feel like depends on (75:30 - 75:34)
updates and what&#39;s going on in the game (75:32 - 75:36)
yep yeah it was the same for wulu like (75:34 - 75:39)
didn&#39;t everyone like transfer their wulu (75:36 - 75:40)
and then all of a sudden like double (75:39 - 75:43)
became like the right move (75:40 - 75:45)
yep and then I&#39;m like looking through my (75:43 - 75:47)
collection I was like I don&#39;t have any I (75:45 - 75:49)
threw them all (75:47 - 75:49)
away uh so yeah I guess (75:54 - 76:00)
like if you need a good syndic Quil your (75:57 - 76:02)
best option is still (76:00 - 76:05)
topalo but if you&#39;re struggling in to (76:02 - 76:08)
topalo wait until May 6 and go to green (76:05 - 76:11)
grass CU they&#39;re boosting fire type (76:08 - 76:13)
there but you guess you can pregame your (76:11 - 76:16)
topalo this week speaking of pregaming (76:13 - 76:19)
holy cow I&#39;m so glad I brought that up I (76:16 - 76:21)
talked about last week how I would (76:19 - 76:24)
pregame my Pokeball (76:21 - 76:26)
Plus+ and then people were like Steve&#39;s (76:24 - 76:30)
cheating no I&#39;m not let me (76:26 - 76:34)
explain let me explain first off nowhere (76:30 - 76:37)
in the the Pokemon sleep contract did I (76:34 - 76:39)
sign that I was I need to press my (76:37 - 76:42)
button at a certain time it&#39;s it&#39;s a (76:39 - 76:46)
game that encourages healthy habits when (76:42 - 76:48)
I get ready for bed I put it on my (76:46 - 76:51)
bedside table I hit the button I go into (76:48 - 76:53)
the bathroom I wash my face I brush my (76:51 - 76:57)
teeth I go downstairs I fill up my water (76:53 - 77:00)
bottle I throw all of Archer&#39;s toys down (76:57 - 77:02)
the stairs because he&#39;s he&#39;s going to (77:00 - 77:03)
spend all night bringing them up into (77:02 - 77:06)
the bed and then I lay in bed and that&#39;s (77:03 - 77:08)
about 10 minutes and then I move the (77:06 - 77:11)
Pokeball plus plus into bed and then (77:08 - 77:14)
whenever I fall asleep that&#39;s what (77:11 - 77:19)
happens and when I do that I get like 95 (77:14 - 77:23)
to 100% every morning every single (77:19 - 77:25)
morning I get my points I&#39;m very happy I (77:23 - 77:29)
get my power powered up Snorlax great (77:25 - 77:31)
encouraging healthy habits but it&#39;s a (77:29 - 77:36)
sleep track it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s tracking it&#39;s (77:31 - 77:41)
okay last night I was so tired that I I (77:36 - 77:44)
skipped all my routines I skipped my (77:41 - 77:46)
healthy habits there was no brushing of (77:44 - 77:48)
I&#39;m I&#39;m ashamed of this there was no (77:46 - 77:49)
brushing the teeth last night there was (77:48 - 77:51)
no washing the face it was I&#39;m (77:49 - 77:53)
immediately getting in bed I&#39;m going to (77:51 - 77:56)
bedot and sleep I get in bed don&#39;t no (77:53 - 77:59)
one judge me I know you all do this uh I (77:56 - 78:04)
get in bed it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s (77:59 - 78:07)
358 and I was I pressed the (78:04 - 78:10)
button and I probably fall asleep within (78:07 - 78:13)
like 5 to 10 minutes I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m out (78:10 - 78:15)
this is why I skipped my (78:13 - 78:18)
routine poke I woke up to a (78:15 - 78:21)
65% even though I slept 9 hours because (78:18 - 78:24)
you know why my cat was making biscuits (78:21 - 78:27)
all night in bed bed and it said that it (78:24 - 78:30)
took me 2 and half hours to fall asleep (78:27 - 78:32)
no it didn&#39;t it took me 10 minutes to (78:30 - 78:35)
fall asleep it not my fault my cat&#39;s (78:32 - 78:37)
over here producing a whole Bakery in (78:35 - 78:39)
the middle of the night and now I didn&#39;t (78:37 - 78:42)
get all my sleep points in the morning (78:39 - 78:47)
but healthy habits pregame your Pokemon (78:42 - 78:50)
sleep uh yeah I will say I&#39;ve been (78:47 - 78:52)
playing this game for six weeks now (78:50 - 78:56)
about six weeks I&#39;ve never had (78:52 - 79:00)
a score of 90 to 100 for my uh for my (78:56 - 79:04)
sleep score um part of that is uh all of (79:00 - 79:06)
that is that I&#39;m still not like I don&#39;t (79:04 - 79:10)
get a ton of sleep every night um but (79:06 - 79:12)
yeah when you said that I didn&#39;t I don&#39;t (79:10 - 79:13)
know I didn&#39;t think there was a problem (79:12 - 79:15)
with that at all like and then I saw (79:13 - 79:17)
everybody talking about throwing out the (79:15 - 79:19)
word cheating and I&#39;m like cheating for (79:17 - 79:22)
what though what is like you can sure (79:19 - 79:24)
sure cheating whatever but like you&#39;re (79:22 - 79:26)
not g gaining anything from it like it&#39;s (79:24 - 79:28)
not like you&#39;re going to win Pokemon (79:26 - 79:30)
sleep now because you do get rewards (79:28 - 79:32)
from having a better sleep score but it (79:30 - 79:34)
doesn&#39;t affect anyone else you&#39;re (79:32 - 79:36)
playing with so it&#39;s like you can call (79:34 - 79:40)
it cheating sure whatever but like I I (79:36 - 79:41)
agree with Steve it&#39;s just better sleep (79:40 - 79:44)
Habits Like I it&#39;s it&#39;s just like it&#39;s (79:41 - 79:47)
just how the Pokeball plus works (79:44 - 79:51)
right well it&#39;s a sleep tracker it&#39;s a (79:47 - 79:54)
bad sleep tracker and that&#39;s the issue (79:51 - 79:55)
that it (79:54 - 79:57)
on average I believe a human takes about (79:55 - 80:00)
14 minutes to fall asleep we don&#39;t fall (79:57 - 80:02)
asleep as soon as we press the button on (80:00 - 80:05)
the Pokémon go Plus+ that&#39;s yeah not how (80:02 - 80:09)
most human brains work um so the fact (80:05 - 80:11)
that there is an amount of time that it (80:09 - 80:13)
wants you to be still before it counts (80:11 - 80:16)
you as being asleep makes sense as a (80:13 - 80:19)
sleep tracker the issue is that it&#39;s bad (80:16 - 80:22)
sleep tracker and it does not track you (80:19 - 80:24)
in isolation it tracks everything around (80:22 - 80:27)
you as well and that&#39;s that&#39;s where (80:24 - 80:29)
you&#39;re kind of making it work for you (80:27 - 80:32)
right so like if if I was going to bed (80:29 - 80:34)
at 3 and this I think I said this last (80:32 - 80:37)
week and I hit the button and I&#39;m still (80:34 - 80:40)
for 10 minutes but uh a partner or (80:37 - 80:44)
significant other or a cat is in the bed (80:40 - 80:45)
and they&#39;re moving every 10 minutes (80:44 - 80:46)
because they&#39;re not sleeping they&#39;re (80:45 - 80:48)
maybe reading a book or watching TV or (80:46 - 80:51)
or Doom (80:48 - 80:51)
scrolling like that&#39;s that&#39;s (80:52 - 80:57)
there&#39;s no way around that and that&#39;s (80:55 - 80:59)
that&#39;s also like you could be like well (80:57 - 81:00)
you&#39;re you&#39;re cheating to tell it you&#39;re (80:59 - 81:02)
going to sleep early but like last night (81:00 - 81:05)
I wasn&#39;t awake for two and a half hours (81:02 - 81:08)
my cat was (81:05 - 81:08)
definitely okay first thing your cat (81:09 - 81:13)
shouldn&#39;t be reading at 3:00 a.m. so (81:11 - 81:15)
yeah that&#39;s true that&#39;s true you know I (81:13 - 81:18)
tell them all the time big fan of (81:15 - 81:21)
Shakespeare but uh so with a with a (81:18 - 81:23)
typical sleep tracker right it&#39;s it&#39;s (81:21 - 81:25)
usually you&#39;re wearing it usually right (81:23 - 81:27)
or I mean I&#39;m not I don&#39;t know sleep (81:25 - 81:31)
trackers at all so R the better ones you (81:27 - 81:33)
wear you&#39;re wearing it right so okay so (81:31 - 81:36)
with with how this game works without (81:33 - 81:39)
the um Plus+ you&#39;re using your phone (81:36 - 81:41)
right your phone has to and correct me (81:39 - 81:42)
if I&#39;m wrong here but the phone has to (81:41 - 81:44)
stay on like the app has to stay open (81:42 - 81:46)
when you&#39;re doing it and so you want to (81:44 - 81:47)
probably have it plugged in right (81:46 - 81:51)
obviously um so how does that work is it (81:47 - 81:52)
the same thing does it wait for you to (81:51 - 81:54)
be still for 10 minutes so your phone is (81:52 - 81:57)
on the bed and it&#39;s almost the same (81:54 - 82:00)
except the phone also uh Records audio I (81:57 - 82:03)
believe yeah where the Plus+ does not (82:00 - 82:06)
right I don&#39;t know if the audio like (82:03 - 82:07)
interrupts or (82:06 - 82:10)
stops like again how the Plus+ works for (82:07 - 82:11)
those that don&#39;t know or how your phone (82:10 - 82:13)
work how Pokemon sleep Works in general (82:11 - 82:17)
is that it needs 10 minutes of nothing (82:13 - 82:20)
and then it starts the sleep session and (82:17 - 82:21)
then (82:20 - 82:26)
technically if you were (82:21 - 82:26)
if you were to like move around like (82:26 - 82:30)
let&#39;s say you slept for like six (82:28 - 82:32)
hours and then there&#39;s a bunch of (82:30 - 82:35)
movement it would consider you (82:32 - 82:37)
awake but if it then goes back to like (82:35 - 82:40)
10 minutes of nothing it will put you (82:37 - 82:41)
back to sleep that&#39;s why when some (82:40 - 82:43)
people press the button in the morning (82:41 - 82:45)
it&#39;ll say like oh you actually woke up (82:43 - 82:47)
like 10 minutes ago is it because it (82:45 - 82:51)
sens that movement so like you could (82:47 - 82:54)
ideally get up at 4:00 a.m. like make a (82:51 - 82:55)
coffee (82:54 - 82:59)
take a shower come back and lay down and (82:55 - 83:00)
if you were to hit it it would be like (82:59 - 83:03)
you&#39;re awake but if you were to be still (83:00 - 83:04)
again it would it would just ignore that (83:03 - 83:06)
and be like okay you&#39;re still sleeping (83:04 - 83:08)
you just you were just rustling around (83:06 - 83:10)
right (83:08 - 83:13)
um what was the point I was making uh (83:10 - 83:14)
but like (83:13 - 83:16)
works I if you if you&#39;re at like the (83:14 - 83:19)
eight minute Mark and your cat jumps on (83:16 - 83:21)
the bed you got to start the 10 minutes (83:19 - 83:26)
over right and that and if your cat is (83:21 - 83:29)
having the Zoomies all night then it&#39;s (83:26 - 83:31)
going to say like oh it took you two and (83:29 - 83:34)
a half hours to fall asleep right but (83:31 - 83:36)
that doesn&#39;t happen like in other nights (83:34 - 83:38)
when my cat has the zoies because he (83:36 - 83:39)
always has the Zoomies every every (83:38 - 83:41)
single night it&#39;s ignoring it&#39;s just (83:39 - 83:44)
it&#39;s just considering that like (83:41 - 83:46)
slumbering or dozing or not slumbering (83:44 - 83:49)
uh dozing or snoozing because it&#39;s it&#39;s (83:46 - 83:51)
committed that 10 that initial 10 (83:49 - 83:54)
minutes of like okay you&#39;re asleep every (83:51 - 83:57)
MO every movement after that is just you (83:54 - 84:02)
tossing and turning right um so is there (83:57 - 84:06)
a a a a lack of movement that will also (84:02 - 84:08)
do something as well I remember hearing (84:06 - 84:10)
about that initially like let&#39;s say (84:08 - 84:12)
instead of putting the Plus+ on your bed (84:10 - 84:15)
you put it on your bedside stand and so (84:12 - 84:16)
it doesn&#39;t have the movement after 10 (84:15 - 84:17)
minutes but then it doesn&#39;t have any (84:16 - 84:20)
movement at all you can do that for up (84:17 - 84:24)
to 6 hours okay right and then it cut (84:20 - 84:26)
mark it say haven&#39;t sensed any movement (84:24 - 84:29)
in 6 hours we&#39;re ending your session now (84:26 - 84:32)
okay got it but if you want if you want (84:29 - 84:35)
guaranteed slumbering for six hours you (84:32 - 84:36)
you could do that but slumbering is like (84:35 - 84:37)
the easiest one to (84:36 - 84:41)
get all depends on how you (84:37 - 84:44)
sleep yeah (84:41 - 84:47)
yeah slumbering is the easiest one to (84:44 - 84:51)
force yes like like if I wanted (84:47 - 84:54)
slumbering for I I don&#39;t even know what (84:51 - 84:55)
is slumbering like I think tot dial is (84:54 - 84:58)
slumbering I could I could technically (84:55 - 85:00)
game the system to get slumbering right (84:58 - 85:01)
I could be like I&#39;m going to put this on (85:00 - 85:03)
here for two hours then I&#39;m going to (85:01 - 85:05)
move it to the bed then when I wake up (85:03 - 85:06)
I&#39;m going to put it back on it like you (85:05 - 85:08)
could force yourself to have (85:06 - 85:10)
slumbering I don&#39;t know how you would (85:08 - 85:12)
force yourself to have like (85:10 - 85:14)
snoozing I don&#39;t know you&#39;re the only (85:12 - 85:15)
one here that games the system according (85:14 - 85:17)
to everybody that&#39;s true I haven&#39;t (85:15 - 85:19)
figured out how to pregame snoozing but (85:17 - 85:20)
like genuinely I don&#39;t know how you (85:19 - 85:23)
would you would get it (85:20 - 85:26)
like like I get that slumbering is like (85:23 - 85:28)
no movement and then there&#39;s dozing and (85:26 - 85:30)
there&#39;s snoozing but I don&#39;t know how (85:28 - 85:33)
it&#39;s determining (85:30 - 85:33)
that like if I was to just like roll (85:33 - 85:38)
over is it consider like while I was (85:36 - 85:41)
sleeping does it consider that like is (85:38 - 85:43)
that a dozing action or is that a (85:41 - 85:45)
snoozing action how much roll I think (85:43 - 85:48)
it&#39;s the percentage of your sleep that (85:45 - 85:51)
is movement versus not movement compared (85:48 - 85:52)
to the percentages from your previous (85:51 - 85:54)
nights I don&#39;t think that&#39;s something (85:52 - 85:59)
you can easily game Beyond (85:54 - 85:59)
slumbering I can&#39;t tell you any of this (86:02 - 86:08)
because I don&#39;t know I I mean this (86:04 - 86:10)
week&#39;s been tough I&#39;ve actually like a (86:08 - 86:12)
couple times I forgot to (86:10 - 86:15)
actually click the the button to get it (86:12 - 86:18)
actually tracking and so I woke up and (86:15 - 86:21)
um or I like fell asleep we had a long (86:18 - 86:23)
week with work with h we had like a work (86:21 - 86:25)
conference thing happening this week so (86:23 - 86:26)
a couple different nights it was just (86:25 - 86:29)
like I fell asleep or something or (86:26 - 86:30)
nodded off on the couch or something and (86:29 - 86:31)
then woke up and it was past 4 am. and I (86:30 - 86:34)
was like no I missed like starting this (86:31 - 86:37)
and uh so then I just recorded it the (86:34 - 86:39)
next day you know just added the Sleep (86:37 - 86:43)
data and didn&#39;t get any um experience (86:39 - 86:45)
points or whatever but I did get you (86:43 - 86:47)
know they do restore the energy for your (86:45 - 86:50)
Pokemon when you do that um then you (86:47 - 86:52)
don&#39;t get any spawns either which is a (86:50 - 86:54)
bummer but that was um there was a (86:52 - 86:56)
comment a couple weeks ago about that (86:54 - 86:59)
because I had done oh I passed 4:00 a.m. (86:56 - 87:01)
but I just did I just did it after 4:00 (86:59 - 87:04)
a.m. and then that became like the first (87:01 - 87:06)
one of the day and then it like screwed (87:04 - 87:09)
things up and so if it&#39;s after 4:00 a. (87:06 - 87:11)
and I notice it or something I just (87:09 - 87:14)
don&#39;t track it now with the Plus+ I just (87:11 - 87:16)
add the data in the morning and and take (87:14 - 87:18)
it that way instead and then you get two (87:16 - 87:20)
if you don&#39;t nap that day you get two um (87:18 - 87:24)
premium biscuits the next day so there (87:20 - 87:26)
are people that (87:24 - 87:30)
don&#39;t record their Monday they&#39;ll (87:26 - 87:32)
manually record their Monday so they&#39;ll (87:30 - 87:35)
miss those spawns but then on Tuesday (87:32 - 87:37)
when their sleep score is better they&#39;ll (87:35 - 87:39)
get two (87:37 - 87:41)
[Music] (87:39 - 87:43)
biscuits but they&#39;re still recording (87:41 - 87:45)
their sleep they&#39;re still recording (87:43 - 87:47)
their sleep they&#39;re just yeah they&#39;re (87:45 - 87:50)
just they&#39;re not opting to get those (87:47 - 87:52)
first five I mean the first five spawns (87:50 - 87:55)
are the same it&#39;s like B sprout (87:52 - 87:58)
cro and like (87:55 - 88:01)
[Laughter] (87:58 - 88:03)
Jigglypuff that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like (88:01 - 88:04)
napping though I don&#39;t like napping (88:03 - 88:07)
because it uses my premium biscuit yeah (88:04 - 88:10)
they made napping almost they&#39;re almost (88:07 - 88:12)
discouraging napping with the way that (88:10 - 88:14)
it works in this (88:12 - 88:17)
game right take your naps they&#39;re also (88:14 - 88:19)
like you&#39;re more likely to get like (88:17 - 88:21)
snoozing if you were to nap cuz like (88:19 - 88:24)
snoozing would be a nap but they&#39;re I (88:21 - 88:27)
don&#39;t know I I don&#39;t like like I woke up (88:24 - 88:29)
with like a 64 this morning and it&#39;s (88:27 - 88:32)
like napping doesn&#39;t fix (88:29 - 88:37)
that because napping goes to that (88:32 - 88:39)
day and then it feels like it ruins my (88:37 - 88:41)
sleep for the night because then I&#39;m (88:39 - 88:43)
going to wake up on Monday not at 100% (88:41 - 88:45)
napping does feel like it feels like a (88:43 - 88:47)
punishment in this game so what is as (88:45 - 88:49)
someone who in this game has never (88:47 - 88:53)
napped like what is the true benefit of (88:49 - 88:55)
in the game what is the true benefit of (88:53 - 88:57)
napping more (88:55 - 88:59)
spawns teally so you do get more spawn (88:57 - 89:01)
you do get are there different spawns (88:59 - 89:03)
when you nap then when you don&#39;t or is (89:01 - 89:05)
it the (89:03 - 89:07)
same it&#39;s drawing from the same spawn (89:05 - 89:10)
pool that you would have that night say (89:07 - 89:11)
Den if you&#39;re on green grass you could (89:10 - 89:13)
or lap you could get you couldn&#39;t get to (89:11 - 89:16)
den because you&#39;re well maybe but like (89:13 - 89:19)
how Pokemon generate in the game are (89:16 - 89:22)
based off snorlax&#39;s power so let&#39;s say (89:19 - 89:24)
like let&#39;s say like Snorlax has I&#39;ll (89:22 - 89:26)
make this really easy let&#39;s say Snorlax (89:24 - 89:29)
has 10,000 power Den would require a (89:26 - 89:34)
base of like 5,000 and then like uh (89:29 - 89:37)
Ivysaur might be like a thousand or or (89:34 - 89:40)
bell sprout might be like 200 (89:37 - 89:44)
so if it determines that like okay we&#39;re (89:40 - 89:45)
going to we&#39;re going to generate all of (89:44 - 89:48)
these Pokemon and now you&#39;re at 4,000 (89:45 - 89:50)
out of you have 4,000 energy left it (89:48 - 89:51)
can&#39;t spawn to den in because it needs (89:50 - 89:53)
that base of (89:51 - 89:56)
5,000 so when you&#39;re because the den (89:53 - 90:00)
requires so much to even spawn in that&#39;s (89:56 - 90:02)
why you&#39;ll probably it&#39;s very rare to (90:00 - 90:04)
like or I wouldn&#39;t say impossible but (90:02 - 90:06)
that&#39;s why you wouldn&#39;t see like two to (90:04 - 90:08)
den because they require so much of (90:06 - 90:13)
snorlax&#39;s power um but if you nap your (90:08 - 90:16)
score isn&#39;t that high because it would (90:13 - 90:20)
be like oh based off of how much how (90:16 - 90:23)
long you slept and then snorlax&#39;s power (90:20 - 90:25)
and then your second sleep s is it can (90:23 - 90:27)
only go up to 100 so if you use 20 for (90:25 - 90:29)
your nap you can only go up to 80 for (90:27 - 90:32)
your actual sleep M so like yes you&#39;re (90:29 - 90:35)
getting more spawns but but you&#39;re (90:32 - 90:38)
limiting those higher potential spawns (90:35 - 90:40)
because you&#39;re cutting snorlax&#39;s power (90:38 - 90:43)
ultimately in half or a fourth or like a (90:40 - 90:47)
quarter depending on what you&#39;re doing (90:43 - 90:49)
so it it it almost feels useless unless (90:47 - 90:51)
you&#39;re just like I need a bunch (90:49 - 90:54)
of bells Sprout candy cuz I need to (90:51 - 90:55)
power Victory Bell so I want to see (90:54 - 90:56)
nothing but Bell I want to see bell (90:55 - 90:59)
sprout twice a day (90:56 - 91:01)
MH so yeah it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s (90:59 - 91:03)
I mean I guess the end of the day the (91:01 - 91:05)
benefit you could nap maybe on like a (91:03 - 91:09)
Sunday because your Snorlax power is so (91:05 - 91:12)
high right that like cutting it into a (91:09 - 91:15)
fourth isn&#39;t going to be that (91:12 - 91:16)
detrimental (91:15 - 91:17)
[Music] (91:16 - 91:19)
mhm but but like (91:17 - 91:22)
who&#39;s but like who realistically is (91:19 - 91:24)
playing like that like if you want to (91:22 - 91:26)
nap on a Tuesday then just take a nap (91:24 - 91:28)
it&#39;s just like that&#39;s where you draw the (91:26 - 91:30)
line napping on a Sunday is where you (91:28 - 91:32)
draw the line that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying (91:30 - 91:34)
well I do like to nap on Sunday but when (91:32 - 91:36)
I do I do I nap almost every Sunday (91:34 - 91:38)
because I like Sundays is like my latest (91:36 - 91:39)
night I&#39;m always up to like 6 a.m. with (91:38 - 91:41)
the podcast and working on (91:39 - 91:45)
it I never turn Pokemon sleep on nap (91:41 - 91:46)
because I feel like it&#39;s a (91:45 - 91:49)
punishment so when you nap that becomes (91:46 - 91:51)
your first sleep of the day right (91:49 - 91:52)
because it&#39;s like recording that day (91:51 - 91:54)
since it&#39;s after 4:00 a.m. so that&#39;s (91:52 - 91:55)
when you&#39;re getting like you said that&#39;s (91:54 - 91:57)
when you&#39;re getting your premium biscuit (91:55 - 91:59)
right yeah and so you&#39;re not getting it (91:57 - 92:00)
when you go to sleep that night and you (91:59 - 92:02)
wake up the next morning you&#39;re not (92:00 - 92:03)
getting the premium biscuit at that (92:02 - 92:08)
point correct okay got it got it yeah (92:03 - 92:11)
that I mean you know take your naps like (92:08 - 92:14)
for your own health and not for a game (92:11 - 92:16)
but yeah that that seems weird I feel (92:14 - 92:18)
like they could maybe do some adjusting (92:16 - 92:20)
to make that a little bit more (92:18 - 92:22)
beneficial for (92:20 - 92:26)
people if naps were like like (92:22 - 92:28)
more I don&#39;t (92:26 - 92:33)
know like if naps were (92:28 - 92:36)
more guaranteed to be like snoozing or (92:33 - 92:38)
dozing cuz I&#39;ve gotten naps where I&#39;ve (92:36 - 92:40)
literally slept 90 minutes and it said I (92:38 - 92:42)
was I was (92:40 - 92:44)
slumbering where it was (92:42 - 92:47)
like like and that&#39;s fine like that&#39;s (92:44 - 92:48)
what it recorded I didn&#39;t move at all (92:47 - 92:49)
for 90 minutes that&#39;s that&#39;s the (92:48 - 92:52)
slumbering (92:49 - 92:52)
cool but (92:52 - 92:56)
but I I I want like I want the snoozing (92:56 - 93:01)
spawns like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want I I (92:59 - 93:03)
don&#39;t want slumbering spawns I want (93:01 - 93:05)
snoozing spawns and you would think like (93:03 - 93:06)
oh a nap would get you maybe more (93:05 - 93:08)
snoozing or dozing and it&#39;s like that (93:06 - 93:11)
doesn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t help right like Den (93:08 - 93:13)
only appears UND (93:11 - 93:17)
dozing and den has such a high (93:13 - 93:21)
requirement to even spawn mhm so like if (93:17 - 93:23)
you wake up after like a good sleep and (93:21 - 93:25)
you&#39;re like okay I&#39;m I&#39;m m 14 on on (93:23 - 93:28)
green grass Den should be able to spawn (93:25 - 93:31)
I woke up oh I have slumbering there&#39;s (93:28 - 93:33)
just no chance that Den&#39;s in that pool I (93:31 - 93:35)
mean this is why the events where (93:33 - 93:37)
Pokemon can spawn regardless of what (93:35 - 93:39)
your sleep style is are so good that&#39;s (93:37 - 93:42)
why they keep doing this yeah yeah yeah (93:39 - 93:46)
yeah y so with this event right not this (93:42 - 93:48)
not this comfy event but the fire week (93:46 - 93:51)
that&#39;s coming up um it did say Pokemon (93:48 - 93:51)
of (93:51 - 93:54)
other like sleep Styles can appear but (93:51 - 93:56)
is it just the ones that are the fire (93:54 - 93:57)
type ones yeah (93:56 - 94:00)
or okay okay so when it says like (93:57 - 94:02)
Pokemon will appear regardless of your (94:00 - 94:04)
sleep style it lists all the fire type (94:02 - 94:05)
Pokemon listed those fire type Pokemon (94:04 - 94:07)
it&#39;s not like a den because that&#39;s not (94:05 - 94:09)
part of this event it&#39;s just for (94:07 - 94:12)
the okay right like right now your (94:09 - 94:15)
options are green grass or topalo and if (94:12 - 94:18)
you wake up with slumbering no chance (94:15 - 94:21)
for Den it has to be dozing right wait (94:18 - 94:23)
green grass or lapis right for den oh (94:21 - 94:26)
yeah la yeah lapis but yeah then it has (94:23 - 94:28)
to be then it has to be dozing that&#39;s (94:26 - 94:30)
yeah that makes it really it&#39;s why (94:28 - 94:31)
people probably (94:30 - 94:35)
feel annoyed I guess like I the the (94:31 - 94:36)
biggest complaint I&#39;ve seen of Pokemon (94:35 - 94:40)
sleep is I wake up and I see the same (94:36 - 94:44)
Pokemon and it&#39;s a very valid complaint (94:40 - 94:47)
and the way that gets fixed is by one (94:44 - 94:49)
continuing to play the game because you (94:47 - 94:51)
need to increase the percentage of your (94:49 - 94:53)
meals you need to increase the (94:51 - 94:55)
percentage of your Island (94:53 - 94:56)
and (94:55 - 94:59)
then two (94:56 - 95:01)
is to like start getting Pokemon that (94:59 - 95:04)
match to then increase your meals and an (95:01 - 95:06)
increase Snorlax because once you do (95:04 - 95:08)
that you do start seeing other Pokemon (95:06 - 95:10)
but there is still that frustration of (95:08 - 95:11)
like I see a lot of bell sprout no (95:10 - 95:13)
matter what and it&#39;s just because that&#39;s (95:11 - 95:15)
how Snorlax (95:13 - 95:18)
generates its power and then breaks it (95:15 - 95:20)
down into certain spawns and certain (95:18 - 95:23)
spawns only appear like if you&#39;re (95:20 - 95:25)
slumbering bell sprout loves slumbering (95:23 - 95:27)
so you&#39;re going to see Bell sprouts and (95:25 - 95:28)
it&#39;s like if if you&#39;re not if you&#39;re (95:27 - 95:30)
looking for syndic Quil and you keep (95:28 - 95:32)
getting slumbering you&#39;re going to see (95:30 - 95:35)
less syil because syil doesn&#39;t like (95:32 - 95:36)
again I should look up what squil is I (95:35 - 95:38)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s (95:36 - 95:41)
snow snoozing um I it&#39;s funny because (95:38 - 95:43)
you know day one day one playing this (95:41 - 95:46)
game why would Hannah ever use a Master (95:43 - 95:47)
biscuit on a (95:46 - 95:49)
den six weeks in I&#39;m like I totally (95:47 - 95:51)
understand why Hannah would (95:49 - 95:53)
wear biscuit that is the best decision (95:51 - 95:56)
I&#39;ve made made in Pokemon sleep so far (95:53 - 95:59)
yeah it makes is still a (95:56 - 96:02)
star the the whole point of this convers (95:59 - 96:07)
conversation is den den is busted (96:02 - 96:07)
good (96:07 - 96:14)
yep who cares about ante (96:10 - 96:18)
D the real legendary Pokemon of Pokemon (96:14 - 96:20)
