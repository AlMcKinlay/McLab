so it's still light out mhm yeah yeah (0:58 - 1:03)
easy for you guys we're recording this (1:01 - 1:05)
on a Saturday night because in in about (1:03 - 1:08)
12 hours I will be on a flight to South (1:05 - 1:11)
Korea which was not planned look I (1:08 - 1:13)
wanted to go to South Korea and Niantic (1:11 - 1:15)
was like ah maybe and then like one week (1:13 - 1:17)
before they're like okay you can go and (1:15 - 1:19)
I was like this is not enough (1:17 - 1:22)

twist my leg okay so full full (1:22 - 1:27)
disclosure going to the Safari Zone in (1:24 - 1:29)
South Korea nitic is paying for flight (1:27 - 1:32)
and 3 days of Hotel just saying that (1:29 - 1:35)
because government requires me to (1:32 - 1:37)
disclose when a company pays for things (1:35 - 1:39)
um I'm going a little bit early though (1:37 - 1:40)
to make sure the stream backpack works (1:39 - 1:44)
and to figure out where I'm going to (1:40 - 1:47)
play since it's a city experience so (1:44 - 1:48)
that's why we're recording on a Saturday (1:47 - 1:50)
night I don't think that there's going (1:48 - 1:53)
to be any breaking news here for Sunday (1:50 - 1:56)
or Monday by the time this episode goes (1:53 - 1:58)
up (1:56 - 2:00)

TCG stuff that's why Bobby's here Bobby (2:00 - 2:04)
was like let me talk about the TCG and I (2:02 - 2:07)
was like I got you mhm mhm it's true (2:04 - 2:10)

that uh good sleep day number two Hannah (2:20 - 2:27)
tell me about your good sleep day I'm I (2:24 - 2:30)
am very much enjoying it I am really (2:27 - 2:32)
kind of surprised they're still giving (2:30 - 2:35)
so many sleep points for (2:32 - 2:37)
free during these events because I feel (2:35 - 2:39)
like I'm never going to run out of sleep (2:37 - 2:42)
points but I got I got I got let me find (2:39 - 2:46)
it hang on hanging hanging I got a shiny (2:42 - 2:49)
rol dang that is actually really cool (2:46 - 2:52)
I'm super happy about (2:49 - 2:55)
it one of the best shinies in the game I (2:52 - 2:59)
think I'm very very happy dang Bobby did (2:55 - 3:01)
you get on your sleep bandwagon or (2:59 - 3:04)
no so here's the thing I know that the (3:01 - 3:06)
last time I was on this show uh I said I (3:04 - 3:08)
was going to try sleep again a Pokemon (3:06 - 3:13)
sleep again um it's not even on my phone (3:08 - 3:15)
anymore so I went the opposite direction (3:13 - 3:16)
on that um okay you know if you don't (3:15 - 3:19)
like it you don't like it yeah I just (3:16 - 3:22)
think uh so we talked about this last (3:19 - 3:24)
time I have a weird way that like when I (3:22 - 3:26)
go to bed I just like am so I always go (3:24 - 3:28)
to bed when I'm like so tired that I (3:26 - 3:31)
just basically roll into bed and I'm (3:28 - 3:32)
never going to be thinking about like (3:31 - 3:34)
turning that go Plus+ on or like (3:32 - 3:37)
whatever you got to do um I've also been (3:34 - 3:39)
like just not having my phone in my room (3:37 - 3:43)
anymore when I go to bed so that has (3:39 - 3:45)
changed a little bit um I am sleeping a (3:43 - 3:47)
little bit more though so that's nice (3:45 - 3:49)
you you don't need an alarm you have (3:47 - 3:55)
kids I no I I do that's true um but the (3:49 - 3:56)
Apple watch I do have the Apple watch on (3:55 - 4:00)
me when I sleep because specifically for (3:56 - 4:02)
the alarm because it won't wake anybody (4:00 - 4:04)
it won't wake anyone else up you know it (4:02 - 4:06)
to just vibrate on my wrist so I do have (4:04 - 4:09)
that but um now I haven't I uninstalled (4:06 - 4:11)
the app and so (4:09 - 4:15)
uh sorry no that's fine that's fine it's (4:11 - 4:20)
not for everybody yeah I uh I I hate (4:15 - 4:22)
coming on the show and and (4:20 - 4:25)
admitting that I gave a mobile game (4:22 - 4:27)
money well that's not true sometimes (4:25 - 4:29)
sometimes I'm like yeah you know I've (4:27 - 4:32)
played $2 going to Korea for a mobile (4:29 - 4:35)
game yeah this what I expect from you (4:32 - 4:37)
your audience expects you to pay Mo pay (4:35 - 4:40)
money for a mobile games true (4:37 - 4:43)
true that's true hey again flight and (4:40 - 4:47)
hotel paid for for that but actually I (4:43 - 4:49)
think I still lose that cuz I got to B (4:47 - 4:51)
pay for my own hotel for like six other (4:49 - 4:54)
days so um yeah that's well look look if (4:51 - 4:56)
you're going 14-hour flight you might as (4:54 - 4:57)
well get the most of it you're already (4:56 - 5:01)
on the other side of the country or (4:57 - 5:03)
world (5:01 - 5:05)
globe uh I fell for the scam I bought (5:03 - 5:07)
the sleep good sleep bundle for (5:05 - 5:13)
$25 that's that's really yeah I why the (5:07 - 5:17)
main reason was uh because of the focus (5:13 - 5:21)
I think it was focus it doubles your um (5:17 - 5:23)
experience points specifically from (5:21 - 5:25)
Snorlax which goes to your main trainer (5:23 - 5:28)
level so you got two of those and then (5:25 - 5:32)
you got two of the (5:28 - 5:35)
um the Pokemon experience so after a (5:32 - 5:37)
really good night you get double of that (5:35 - 5:39)
and I was planning to use them both I (5:37 - 5:41)
was like you know what like this is the (5:39 - 5:44)
day to use it if you're going to min max (5:41 - 5:46)
the gem situation in this game it's like (5:44 - 5:48)
the people who are like okay it's it's (5:46 - 5:52)
it's double experience hour plus I'm (5:48 - 5:53)
going to pop a lucky egg and now I'm (5:52 - 5:54)
going to hit a bunch of pidgeys right (5:53 - 5:57)
you're like maximizing your experience I (5:54 - 6:00)
was like okay so I want all of that I (5:57 - 6:02)
I'm really out of pokeballs I would like (6:00 - 6:04)
some great balls and then I don't even (6:02 - 6:06)
remember the last thing so I was like (6:04 - 6:07)
you know what I'm just going to pull the (6:06 - 6:10)
trigger cuz I did want to see how much (6:07 - 6:12)
experience you got and I was like level (6:10 - 6:16)
23 and a half and I went all the way up (6:12 - 6:20)
to like 25 with the experience so it did (6:16 - 6:23)
it did like blow it was like hot new (6:20 - 6:25)
record high score and then that was of (6:23 - 6:29)
course doubled because of the incense I (6:25 - 6:32)
I didn't opt to use the experience (6:29 - 6:34)
because I was like I don't like any of (6:32 - 6:35)
these Pokemon like these Pokemon are (6:34 - 6:36)
just filler Pokemon until I get better (6:35 - 6:39)
ones so and then I'm saving the other (6:36 - 6:41)
incense for literally I'm just going to (6:39 - 6:42)
save it for a whole month for the next (6:41 - 6:45)
good sleep day cuz why would you not use (6:42 - 6:47)
it I mean you could use it to accelerate (6:45 - 6:50)
but like there are also three days in (6:47 - 6:51)
good sleep date there's still one more (6:50 - 6:53)
night left after we're recording here (6:51 - 6:56)
yeah but it's only 1.5 not times two (6:53 - 6:58)
yeah and I guess you go to sleep after (6:56 - 7:00)
4:00 a.m. so maybe it's not going to be (6:58 - 7:02)
good sleep I'm not confident in (7:00 - 7:04)
tonight's sleep to use (7:02 - 7:06)
it the other thing I've learned is (7:04 - 7:08)
always put the incense on before you go (7:06 - 7:10)
to bed I've definitely like put incense (7:08 - 7:13)
on midday thinking like yeah tonight's (7:10 - 7:14)
going to be the night and then all of a (7:13 - 7:16)
sudden like something happens I didn't (7:14 - 7:19)
get a good night's sleep or I like just (7:16 - 7:22)
put the incense on before you go to bed (7:19 - 7:24)
unless it's going to be a recovery (7:22 - 7:25)
incense cuz you know you're not going to (7:24 - 7:27)
sleep enough because then you can just (7:25 - 7:28)
put that on once you realize you're not (7:27 - 7:31)
going to sleep enough that's my favorite (7:28 - 7:34)
incense yeah so it was it was more of (7:31 - 7:36)
like I'm going to give this game $25 I (7:34 - 7:38)
am enjoying it um this is the first time (7:36 - 7:39)
I've spent money besides the (7:38 - 7:42)
subscription I'm you know I I want to (7:39 - 7:45)
see if I I feel I'm like getting value (7:42 - 7:47)
of some sort but at the end of the day (7:45 - 7:49)
the only thing you're really doing is (7:47 - 7:51)
accelerating that's just like Pokemon go (7:49 - 7:54)
you're just accelerating you're paying (7:51 - 7:56)
to sleep which I think I love the fact (7:54 - 7:58)
that like it's like if there's one time (7:56 - 7:59)
of the day when you're probably not (7:58 - 8:00)
going to spend money it's when you're (7:59 - 8:03)
sleeping no they figured it out like how (8:00 - 8:05)
can we spend money while we're sleeping (8:03 - 8:09)
it's perfect they mastered it it's great (8:05 - 8:11)
I I like the game a lot though it's so (8:09 - 8:14)
deep like there's so (8:11 - 8:16)
many like I don't know if I'd say deep (8:14 - 8:19)
it's very detailed it's very detailed (8:16 - 8:21)
there's so many like skills and like I'm (8:19 - 8:23)
going to pair these Pokemon together and (8:21 - 8:25)
I'm going to like try to focus on this (8:23 - 8:27)
and like these skills line up for a good (8:25 - 8:29)
combination and like right now I'm like (8:27 - 8:31)
catching every Caterpie cuz Butterfree (8:29 - 8:34)
apparently is busted good in this game (8:31 - 8:38)
like I will say that like as someone so (8:34 - 8:39)
obviously I play go all the time and so (8:38 - 8:41)
I don't really I don't really see it (8:39 - 8:43)
from the side of someone who doesn't (8:41 - 8:44)
play the game and now but now with this (8:43 - 8:47)
I am seeing like the side of oh I'm just (8:44 - 8:49)
seeing the social media posts about the (8:47 - 8:52)
game and what I've taken from this is (8:49 - 8:54)
that I think anyone who doesn't play (8:52 - 8:57)
Pokemon and just looks at social media (8:54 - 8:58)
the only thing that anyone seems to care (8:57 - 9:01)
about is Shiny Pokemon on like that's (8:58 - 9:02)
the only thing that ever gets posted is (9:01 - 9:04)
just here's another shiny here's another (9:02 - 9:07)
shiny here's another shiny and so I'm (9:04 - 9:09)
glad to hear that there's more depth to (9:07 - 9:11)
the game because all I ever see on the (9:09 - 9:14)
on threads or on X or whatever is just (9:11 - 9:17)
Shiny Pokemon left and no that's (9:14 - 9:19)
exciting but I for me it's more exciting (9:17 - 9:20)
because I know how skills work so like (9:19 - 9:22)
when you get like a like so you have (9:20 - 9:24)
five skills you get one at 10 25 50 75 (9:22 - 9:26)
100 and when those start turning gold (9:24 - 9:28)
they can be white as basic blue is (9:26 - 9:30)
Advanced and then (9:28 - 9:32)
gold is like the best and you get a (9:30 - 9:34)
Pokemon with like two gold and then the (9:32 - 9:36)
two gold you want that like match up (9:34 - 9:39)
with its main ability you're like oh my (9:36 - 9:41)
this thing's going to be getting me milk (9:39 - 9:43)
all night I'm going to be rolling in (9:41 - 9:45)
milk in the morning or like honey and (9:43 - 9:47)
the the Butterfree gets honey (9:45 - 9:49)
but it is got to hope it doesn't have a (9:47 - 9:52)
bad nature yeah you we got to make sure (9:49 - 9:53)
yeah so you got you got to have skills (9:52 - 9:56)
nature it all adds up this is super this (9:53 - 9:58)
is like way more complicated than like (9:56 - 10:00)
hey you just go to sleep wake up and (9:58 - 10:02)
then like catch a Pokemon which is what (10:00 - 10:04)
it was kind of like marketed as yeah no (10:02 - 10:06)
it's like Pok√©mon go but way more (10:04 - 10:08)
advanced cuz Pok√©mon go they don't have (10:06 - 10:11)
like abilities and if they have moves (10:08 - 10:12)
you can change them but the only thing (10:11 - 10:14)
you're catching you know a bunch of (10:12 - 10:18)
Crawlers for is the IVs mhm you're like (10:14 - 10:19)
I want these IVs and then you're (10:18 - 10:21)
catching up for like the candy and then (10:19 - 10:23)
eventually power them up but you are (10:21 - 10:24)
rolling over and over for different (10:23 - 10:26)
Pokemon with different skills and when (10:24 - 10:28)
you keep catching the same Pokemon (10:26 - 10:31)
you're gu guing or you're you're (10:28 - 10:33)
increasing the likelihood of getting (10:31 - 10:35)
those gold skills um but the gold skills (10:33 - 10:37)
are still randomly rolling in certain (10:35 - 10:40)
situations so look there's a website (10:37 - 10:42)
that's a calculator and you can punch (10:40 - 10:43)
your Pokemon in and then it will grade (10:42 - 10:45)
them for you it'll be like this is a c (10:43 - 10:46)
tier Pokemon you're like I don't want to (10:45 - 10:47)
level up a c tier I'm going to wait till (10:46 - 10:50)
I get like an a tier I need to ask for (10:47 - 10:53)
that website see it's good we're g this (10:50 - 10:56)
was my $25 justification I'm I I want to (10:53 - 11:00)
live in Pokemon go sleep Pokemon going (10:56 - 11:02)
to sleep (11:00 - 11:02)
spreadsheets although I can easily see (11:04 - 11:09)
how if you are a whale you are just (11:06 - 11:11)
throwing money at it to like catch (11:09 - 11:14)
everything to optimize you're just like (11:11 - 11:16)
they like everything in the store is (11:14 - 11:19)
just how can you speed this game up for (11:16 - 11:23)
$2 $5 $10 which speed up to where though (11:19 - 11:25)
like what's the to complete the poex to (11:23 - 11:27)
complete the Sleep decks your sleep (11:25 - 11:29)
research then you just stop sleeping you (11:27 - 11:31)
get to stop sleeping after that you (11:29 - 11:32)
don't have to sleep anymore it's like (11:31 - 11:34)
well the hot oh so I've been playing (11:32 - 11:37)
what the game's been out for six weeks (11:34 - 11:38)
no maybe longer than that because I got (11:37 - 11:41)
two months so 10 weeks I think sounds (11:38 - 11:43)
about right I think I think two months (11:41 - 11:46)
two weeks and the highest I've ever (11:43 - 11:48)
gotten is master rank two and I'm pretty (11:46 - 11:52)
sure goes up to master rank 20 yeah oh (11:48 - 11:54)
and I've only gotten master rank three (11:52 - 11:56)
times and this was the first time this (11:54 - 11:58)
was the first time I got to master rank (11:56 - 12:01)
without using a good good camp ticket is (11:58 - 12:04)
it a weekly thing you and resets every (12:01 - 12:07)

half of October we apologize for any (13:28 - 13:33)
inconvenience caused by these bugs (13:31 - 13:34)

conditions victories against NPC (13:34 - 13:38)
trainers scattered across the game world (13:36 - 13:41)
may not be recorded as a result players (13:38 - 13:44)
uh can earn winnings winning can earn a (13:41 - 13:45)

about this last week where the Game (13:54 - 14:00)
Stops recording after 300 which (13:57 - 14:01)
this Pokemon game has the most trainer (14:00 - 14:03)
battles than any other Pokemon game (14:01 - 14:06)
surprisingly so we have a total on how (14:03 - 14:07)
many trainers I think it's (14:06 - 14:10)
307 that sounds right it's like slightly (14:07 - 14:14)
over 300 wow they just barely hit the (14:10 - 14:18)
ceiling of numbers I think I fought like (14:14 - 14:18)
10 well you got 297 to go Bobby yes so (14:19 - 14:28)
um you know you could make the argument (14:26 - 14:30)
of like (14:28 - 14:33)
that maybe it's been 300 for 10 20 years (14:30 - 14:36)
and they never thought that like they (14:33 - 14:38)
would hit that cap of oh the game just (14:36 - 14:40)
stops recording after 300 cuz we've (14:38 - 14:43)
never had 305 (14:40 - 14:47)
trainers um but maybe you know game (14:43 - 14:49)
freak also doesn't know how many (14:47 - 14:51)
trainers there are because I it's like (14:49 - 14:54)
impossible to find them all like they're (14:51 - 14:57)
just all over the place did you get any (14:54 - 14:59)
comments from last week or people you (14:57 - 15:01)
know messaging to say that they did uh (14:59 - 15:04)
battle all the trainers um I had two (15:01 - 15:06)
people come into my stream and say that (15:04 - 15:07)
they they did battle everything cuz they (15:06 - 15:10)
were completionist which makes sense um (15:07 - 15:12)
you know if the game was like here's a (15:10 - 15:14)
shirt well there's no shirts in the game (15:12 - 15:16)
if the game was like here's a backpack (15:14 - 15:18)
because you battled everyone I would (15:16 - 15:21)
probably do that too cuz I would like to (15:18 - 15:22)
I would have done that but I hate (15:21 - 15:25)
completing something in a game that's (15:22 - 15:27)
tedious that you don't get anything for (15:25 - 15:28)
I'm talking about you cororo seeds and (15:27 - 15:29)
Zelda (15:28 - 15:35)
I ain't falling for that so so uh there (15:29 - 15:38)
there weren't 300 trainers though in (15:35 - 15:40)
just imp Pala right because the whole (15:38 - 15:43)
Pro problem was like getting into kakami (15:40 - 15:45)
then you start to realize if you that (15:43 - 15:47)
you're not getting certain things that (15:45 - 15:48)
was when it was realized right so right (15:47 - 15:50)
because people would people saved the (15:48 - 15:53)
ogre clan for last which makes sense and (15:50 - 15:55)
then I think there's seven ogre clan (15:53 - 15:59)
members or nine or maybe eight I think (15:55 - 16:02)
it's around there yeah it's it's like (15:59 - 16:04)
above five but below 10 and then they (16:02 - 16:07)
realized that they couldn't finish the (16:04 - 16:10)
ogre Clan specifically they already (16:07 - 16:11)
battled everyone they saved ogre clan (16:10 - 16:13)
for last they battled the first couple (16:11 - 16:15)
that was good and then the last couple (16:13 - 16:19)
just they were so there weren't 300 in (16:15 - 16:22)
Scarlet Violet only because of the DLC (16:19 - 16:23)
that it pushed it over 300 so I think (16:22 - 16:26)
the DLC added like 30 trainers total or (16:23 - 16:30)
35 or something um so just so 27 (16:26 - 16:35)
Scarlet that's that's nothing yeah uh (16:30 - 16:39)
the the garbage King has also said (16:35 - 16:42)
here that it is not currently possible (16:39 - 16:45)
to transfer certain special Pokemon to (16:42 - 16:46)
Pokemon scarlet and violet via Pokemon (16:45 - 16:48)
home if those Pokemon were brought into (16:46 - 16:51)
to Pokemon home via Pokemon go even if (16:48 - 16:53)
the Pokemon is the same species already (16:51 - 16:55)
obtained in Scarlet or Violet prior to (16:53 - 16:56)
version (16:55 - 17:00)
1.3.2 um this is is very vague like what (16:56 - 17:02)
is considered a special Pokemon the one (17:00 - 17:03)
that I've been told isn't working right (17:02 - 17:08)
now is Reggie Eli so if you CAU a yeah (17:03 - 17:09)
he's not that special well he's special (17:08 - 17:12)
my heart but uh so if you caught a (17:09 - 17:16)
Reggie eliy and Pogo you move it to home (17:12 - 17:17)
it just cannot go into scarlet and (17:16 - 17:19)
violet right now even though Reggie YY (17:17 - 17:20)
is (17:19 - 17:24)
allowed um I don't know if other like I (17:20 - 17:25)
wish they would just list out which (17:24 - 17:26)
Pokemon I don't know why they say (17:25 - 17:29)
special Pokemon right if this is I'm (17:26 - 17:30)
pretty sure this has been a bug for a (17:29 - 17:34)
while they may have fixed it in general (17:30 - 17:37)
for most of them but maybe it's just a (17:34 - 17:39)
few left over ever since the updates but (17:37 - 17:41)
this has been a problem since you could (17:39 - 17:44)
transfer Pokemon in but couldn't you (17:41 - 17:47)
before I remember this as well but (17:44 - 17:49)
couldn't you wasn't it if you had caught (17:47 - 17:51)
it though in Scarlet Violet then you (17:49 - 17:54)
could transfer it in no that's that's a (17:51 - 17:58)
purposeful lock this is okay this like (17:54 - 18:01)
like like I have Reggie Eli in scarlet (17:58 - 18:04)
and Violet from sword and shield and I (18:01 - 18:06)
still wouldn't be able to move Pokemon (18:04 - 18:09)
go regy in no no I understand but I just (18:06 - 18:11)
meant what you were saying Hannah was (18:09 - 18:13)
that the purposeful walk thing because I (18:11 - 18:15)
remember that issue people not like (18:13 - 18:17)
bringing being able to bring things in (18:15 - 18:20)
and then um I think Steve you had (18:17 - 18:21)
explained it on either the podcast or (18:20 - 18:25)
your stream about how you had to have (18:21 - 18:26)
the Pokemon already in scarlet and (18:25 - 18:29)
violet to bring them in from Pok√©mon go (18:26 - 18:30)
and then once the first one was in then (18:29 - 18:31)
you were good to go or something and (18:30 - 18:34)
then everything else could come in (18:31 - 18:37)
yeah so there's also another bug that's (18:34 - 18:40)
not listed here uh it's a bug I've (18:37 - 18:43)
experienced a lot of them yeah so I (18:40 - 18:45)
experienced this when uh when when the (18:43 - 18:48)
DLC came out they they turned on or (18:45 - 18:50)
fixed the item finder Mark the item (18:48 - 18:51)
finder Mark was in the game since day (18:50 - 18:54)
one um and then it magically started (18:51 - 18:57)
working the day the DLC came out (18:54 - 19:00)
so uh was it broken the entire time yes (18:57 - 19:02)
was it purposely broken cuz they were (19:00 - 19:04)
going to turn it on because of this DLC (19:02 - 19:07)
maybe uh like the destiny Mark was (19:04 - 19:09)
technically in Scarlet or sword and (19:07 - 19:12)
shield the entire time since day one (19:09 - 19:14)
they never turned it (19:12 - 19:17)
on was it supposed to be on we'll never (19:14 - 19:18)
know because they're probably never (19:17 - 19:22)
going to say um it works in scar it (19:18 - 19:24)
works in Scar and violet um so when I (19:22 - 19:26)
was so how the the item fighter Mark (19:24 - 19:28)
works is you just use the let's go (19:26 - 19:29)
feature which is just sending your (19:28 - 19:31)
Pokemon out to pick up items that in (19:29 - 19:32)
itself is already like kind of a (19:31 - 19:34)
miserable experience cuz sometimes it (19:32 - 19:35)
works sometimes it doesn't sometimes (19:34 - 19:36)
your Pokemon just stands there and (19:35 - 19:41)
doesn't pick it up um but uh the bug (19:36 - 19:43)
that I've experienced is you'll send a (19:41 - 19:45)
Pokemon out and it won't do anything (19:43 - 19:47)
it'll just stand there and you can't (19:45 - 19:50)
recall it and you you can't you can't go (19:47 - 19:51)
in you you literally can't do anything (19:50 - 19:53)
it just stands there you can't do (19:51 - 19:54)
anything with it it doesn't move it (19:53 - 19:57)
doesn't pick it up um if you switch it (19:54 - 19:59)
in your party it still stays standing (19:57 - 20:01)
out there so the only fix that I figured (19:59 - 20:04)
out was save the game turn it off turn (20:01 - 20:07)
it back on and it's fine oh wow um I I (20:04 - 20:11)
experienced that problem a lot because I (20:07 - 20:13)
was trying to get the item finder mark (20:11 - 20:16)
on my Pokemon so I I I got it like three (20:13 - 20:19)
times a day almost playing you know (20:16 - 20:22)
eight hours that's a pretty frequent bug (20:19 - 20:26)
yeah and and I I saw somebody reply to (20:22 - 20:29)
Mr Joe caby that like do you know about (20:26 - 20:31)
this bug and it was exactly what I (20:29 - 20:33)
experienced and Joe was like no I never (20:31 - 20:35)
heard of this bug and it was like 2 or 3 (20:33 - 20:37)
days after SV came out and I was like I (20:35 - 20:40)
mess I was like Joe I got the same bug (20:37 - 20:42)
and this is how I this is what I (20:40 - 20:44)
experienced this is how I fixed it and (20:42 - 20:45)
then I saw other people say they also (20:44 - 20:48)
have that bug so I don't know it's not (20:45 - 20:49)
listed on (20:48 - 20:52)
here I maybe it's not as common as this (20:49 - 20:56)
but I was able to not reproduce it but (20:52 - 20:59)
like it happened multiple times yeah (20:56 - 21:00)
video footage of it happening it's (20:59 - 21:02)
because everybody told Joe from cab (21:00 - 21:05)
about it and and not the Pokemon company (21:02 - 21:07)
yeah no one went to the no one told (21:05 - 21:10)
garbage King what's happening over (21:07 - 21:15)
here so I don't I don't know um some (21:10 - 21:16)
other scarlet and violent news before we (21:15 - 21:21)
take a break is uh that they weirdly (21:16 - 21:24)
announced huian deui and then they (21:21 - 21:30)
unannounced huian deui I guess um (21:24 - 21:33)
so I actually knew that this was (21:30 - 21:35)
somewhat coming um because I was I was (21:33 - 21:37)
talking to somebody at the Pokemon (21:35 - 21:39)
company and they were like we we want to (21:37 - 21:41)
get more people into raids and we might (21:39 - 21:44)
do some like sponsored YouTube stuff to (21:41 - 21:45)
get more people into raids and I was (21:44 - 21:46)
like yeah that sounds awesome and (21:45 - 21:48)
they're like hey just don't be offended (21:46 - 21:50)
that we don't offer the deal to you (21:48 - 21:52)
because your community Al already knows (21:50 - 21:53)
how to do raids and I was (21:52 - 21:57)
like yeah it makes sense yeah I I get it (21:53 - 21:59)
I totally get it like you're you're (21:57 - 22:01)
wasting money advertising to people that (21:59 - 22:03)
definitely know about raids like you all (22:01 - 22:04)
listen to the podcast you know about (22:03 - 22:09)
raids um so I get it so anyways um (22:04 - 22:11)
that's just like business 101 I suppose (22:09 - 22:14)
why would you advertise to people it was (22:11 - 22:16)
very nice that they were transparent but (22:14 - 22:19)
they um but they there was a a couple (22:16 - 22:22)
YouTubers um friend of the show Mr real (22:19 - 22:24)
breaking Nate he does some TCG stuff he (22:22 - 22:27)
was one of the people that ran the tiu (22:24 - 22:29)
and deui app (22:27 - 22:31)
um and there was also the Clefairy ad in (22:29 - 22:34)
it so there was uh the Clefairy outbreak (22:31 - 22:36)
stuff which I do want to spend a second (22:34 - 22:38)
talking about so Clefairy outbreak was (22:36 - 22:40)
happening this weekend and then they (22:38 - 22:43)
were like Hing to sigui next weekend and (22:40 - 22:45)
they and that was cool and I was like oh (22:43 - 22:48)
yeah like this this makes sense like (22:45 - 22:50)
this is clearly a paid product placement (22:48 - 22:51)
it says at the top like you know paid (22:50 - 22:52)
product placement says in the (22:51 - 22:54)
description like this segment was paid (22:52 - 22:57)
for by the Pokemon company International (22:54 - 23:00)
awesome uh and then uh another YouTuber (22:57 - 23:01)
had it and then you know people started (23:00 - 23:02)
posting on Twitter so then I made the (23:01 - 23:04)
graphic the only thing I was really (23:02 - 23:06)
waiting for was like what terot type it (23:04 - 23:08)
was and you just look at the picture of (23:06 - 23:11)
toi and you can see that the the leaves (23:08 - 23:12)
are coming like it's grass it's got a (23:11 - 23:14)
hat yeah it has a (23:12 - 23:18)
hat so I was like cool grass thei sweet (23:14 - 23:19)
do some raid builds for it raid builds (23:18 - 23:21)
are already on YouTube right now if you (23:19 - 23:23)
want to see what to build for it um and (23:21 - 23:25)
then they were taken down so if you go (23:23 - 23:26)
back to those same people those same (23:25 - 23:29)
YouTubers that ran the ads the deui is (23:26 - 23:31)
no longer there it's cut so either the (23:29 - 23:33)
whole ad is cut or the half of the ad is (23:31 - 23:34)
cut and it's only the (23:33 - 23:37)
Clefairy which I mean everyone now knows (23:34 - 23:40)
the cgy is coming and it's on SB and you (23:37 - 23:42)
know it's on Twitter and you know all (23:40 - 23:44)
the sites comicbook.com everything (23:42 - 23:46)
reported on (23:44 - 23:48)
it so (23:46 - 23:51)
it's I don't think any YouTuber messed (23:48 - 23:53)
up because all the YouTubers drop their (23:51 - 23:55)
video at the same time on a Tuesday (23:53 - 23:58)
right like hey your embargo is probably (23:55 - 23:59)
like I don't I I don't even remember was (23:58 - 24:01)
it was either 1: p.m. or 2 p.m. on (23:59 - 24:04)
Tuesday your embargo is this time you (24:01 - 24:06)
know you can post the video anytime (24:04 - 24:08)
after that but all these people their (24:06 - 24:10)
videos went live at exactly 2 I checked (24:08 - 24:12)
multiple they all had like this ad deal (24:10 - 24:15)
and then a couple hours later the deui (24:12 - 24:16)
part was cut out (24:15 - 24:18)
so I don't know where that (24:16 - 24:21)
miscommunication is I don't think it was (24:18 - 24:24)
the YouTuber's fault sounds like from (24:21 - 24:26)
the company like either either they had (24:24 - 24:30)
the wrong date which would be a weird (24:26 - 24:34)
mistake to make or they uh or they found (24:30 - 24:36)
something out like right afterwards or (24:34 - 24:37)
figured something out right afterwards (24:36 - 24:39)
and went oh never mind we can't do that (24:37 - 24:40)
or something he's hoping the raids (24:39 - 24:43)
aren't broken again well that's sort of (24:40 - 24:47)
what but like yeah probably not but I (24:43 - 24:50)
guess like weird maybe Sunday night (24:47 - 24:54)
comes around and it's it's hu to CI with (24:50 - 24:56)
the fire terot type maybe they were like (24:54 - 24:57)
the the fire type the terot type's wrong (24:56 - 24:59)
or the the dates are wrong or maybe we (24:57 - 25:01)
actually want to do samuro first it (24:59 - 25:04)
seemed like but also at the same time (25:01 - 25:07)
why why is it such a secret like oh we (25:04 - 25:09)
even if the argument is oh we announced (25:07 - 25:10)
it too (25:09 - 25:12)
early it's already out there at that (25:10 - 25:13)
moment somebody announced it though (25:12 - 25:15)
right officially no they officially (25:13 - 25:17)
announce it but I would say if you're (25:15 - 25:20)
paying for an ad to go live at 2 p.m. on (25:17 - 25:22)
you know five channels or however I I (25:20 - 25:24)
don't know how many channels they put it (25:22 - 25:29)
on um that's a way of announcing it (25:24 - 25:31)
so like even yes (25:29 - 25:33)
yeah but (25:31 - 25:36)
like what does it matter if it's (25:33 - 25:40)
announced on a Tuesday versus a Sunday (25:36 - 25:42)
like what why why are we keeping it such (25:40 - 25:45)
a secret like it still was surprising to (25:42 - 25:47)
people people were still hyped and (25:45 - 25:50)
excited on Tuesday MH um it it was just (25:47 - 25:52)
that that business decision what (25:50 - 25:54)
whoever's fault that was or whatever (25:52 - 25:55)
that (25:54 - 25:58)
that's fine and weird I think it's silly (25:55 - 26:00)
to like tell like you paid for the ad (25:58 - 26:02)
and now you're telling the person to (26:00 - 26:04)
take it out so are you going to pay them (26:02 - 26:05)
for another ad like the I'm sure the (26:04 - 26:07)
YouTubers got their money I will say (26:05 - 26:13)
like side note I think Pokemon paying (26:07 - 26:16)
Pokemon you or video game adjacent (26:13 - 26:19)
YouTubers knowing Their audience (26:16 - 26:22)
are fans of Pokemon is like kind of a (26:19 - 26:24)
win-win for everyone I think everyone is (26:22 - 26:28)
just so sick of like hello fresh or r (26:24 - 26:32)
Shadow Legends or yeah whatever ad like (26:28 - 26:35)
if I'm watching Pokemon TCG I'm going to (26:32 - 26:38)
use real breaking n as example if I love (26:35 - 26:42)
the Pokemon Trading Card Game and I'm (26:38 - 26:43)
I'm watching his content because I love (26:42 - 26:47)
it and then there's a Pokemon ad by Nate (26:43 - 26:50)
for Clefairy and hu deui for scarlet and (26:47 - 26:53)
violet I think that's a really good way (26:50 - 26:55)
to get that information out there (26:53 - 26:57)
because Nate isn't normally just going (26:55 - 26:59)
to make a video being like this is why (26:57 - 27:00)
they didn't do it with me cuz I'm going (26:59 - 27:02)
to make that video cuz Nate's not going (27:00 - 27:03)
to like tell his (27:02 - 27:05)
audience hey cair's this weekend and (27:03 - 27:09)
scarlin violet mhm like I think it's a (27:05 - 27:11)
win-win like those people can make a (27:09 - 27:12)
living they get a little money they work (27:11 - 27:14)
with a brand they obviously like I'm (27:12 - 27:16)
going to go on record here and say I (27:14 - 27:18)
think Nate really likes Pokemon he's (27:16 - 27:19)
been making Pokemon content for like (27:18 - 27:22)
eight plus years um so I just think it's (27:19 - 27:23)
a win-win so it's really cool so if (27:22 - 27:24)
you're listening to Pokemon keep doing (27:23 - 27:26)
that that's really cool I just (27:24 - 27:29)
think why I don't I the pulling it was (27:26 - 27:33)
just really weird yeah why the why take (27:29 - 27:36)
it back and really really hoping raids (27:33 - 27:38)
aren't broken (27:36 - 27:41)
again maybe they wanted to announce it (27:38 - 27:44)
as well like together what I don't know (27:41 - 27:45)
why they would pull it back at this (27:44 - 27:47)
point but like maybe they wanted to (27:45 - 27:48)
announce it together and then didn't so (27:47 - 27:50)
they were like pull it back and then (27:48 - 27:53)
we're going to like reann it to it's (27:50 - 27:55)
just I've never seen poke the Pokemon (27:53 - 27:57)
obviously I've seen Niantic you know (27:55 - 28:00)
release information through YouTubers (27:57 - 28:02)
and not really ever say anything (28:00 - 28:04)
themselves on stuff but the Pokemon (28:02 - 28:07)
company I've never seen them uh release (28:04 - 28:10)
stuff through other sources but not also (28:07 - 28:12)
have their own official thing happening (28:10 - 28:14)
at the same time that would be kind of a (28:12 - 28:17)
first I feel like from directly from the (28:14 - 28:18)
Pokemon (28:17 - 28:21)
company uh I mean I like hosted Pokemon (28:18 - 28:23)
day on the front page of twitch that was (28:21 - 28:26)
kind of like news related yeah but (28:23 - 28:28)
Pokemon day Pokemon day well Pokemon was (28:26 - 28:30)
well announced by the Pokemon company oh (28:28 - 28:32)
right right right right I'm saying like (28:30 - 28:35)
I've never seen it where you announces (28:32 - 28:37)
something for the Pokemon company and (28:35 - 28:39)
the Pokemon company doesn't also have (28:37 - 28:42)
that announcement in their own in their (28:39 - 28:44)
own way on their website or something (28:42 - 28:45)
like that like I've not seen that before (28:44 - 28:48)
this would be a first to my knowledge I (28:45 - 28:50)
feel like there was a UK thing where (28:48 - 28:52)
they partnered with a couple of UK (28:50 - 28:55)
YouTubers to announce like one card in (28:52 - 28:56)
an upcoming set like this person (28:55 - 28:58)
announced the farfetched this person (28:56 - 29:02)
announced the siny yes okay I but I (28:58 - 29:03)
don't but I think they did update the (29:02 - 29:07)
website relatively the same day but even (29:03 - 29:09)
even that even like announcing an (29:07 - 29:11)
English card the Japanese cards had (29:09 - 29:12)
already been out so like I'm talking (29:11 - 29:14)
about a brand new thing that no one (29:12 - 29:16)
knows about like true that that's just (29:14 - 29:17)
I've just never seen that where the (29:16 - 29:19)
Pokemon company didn't also have their (29:17 - 29:21)
own announcement paired with that (29:19 - 29:24)
they're doing a bunch of new things with (29:21 - 29:25)
with creators though there have been all (29:24 - 29:28)
of the Pokemon sleep events and when (29:25 - 29:30)
first DLC dropped there was an event (29:28 - 29:32)
that some creators were able to go go to (29:30 - 29:34)
in person so there are they are working (29:32 - 29:36)
on working with creators in different (29:34 - 29:38)
ways at least from what I can see as (29:36 - 29:41)
someone who is just here yeah they they (29:38 - 29:43)
definitely are working with creators (29:41 - 29:45)
absolutely I just still think it's weird (29:43 - 29:46)
because I even with all of that we all (29:45 - 29:48)
had the we all knew about all of that (29:46 - 29:49)
usually they do announce stuff at the (29:48 - 29:51)
same time yeah there would usually be an (29:49 - 29:53)
announcement of a new thing happening at (29:51 - 29:56)
the same time as creators like creators (29:53 - 29:58)
going to a Pokemon sleep event well (29:56 - 29:59)
Pokemon sleep we knew about Pokemon (29:58 - 30:02)
sleep same with the DLC this is like a (29:59 - 30:05)
new thing huan deu is in raids and it (30:02 - 30:06)
was just weird that they didn't also (30:05 - 30:08)
have their own their own announcement (30:06 - 30:10)
which they may have at the time that the (30:08 - 30:13)
creators were able to release the video (30:10 - 30:14)
they may have already been like oh no (30:13 - 30:16)
hold on we're pulling this (30:14 - 30:18)
back let's tell every like let's tell (30:16 - 30:19)
them all and so that's why the (30:18 - 30:20)
announcement never happened that's why (30:19 - 30:23)
the creators took the stuff back but (30:20 - 30:26)
it's weird it's just weird (30:23 - 30:29)
wow it's it's not it's not a super (30:26 - 30:31)
straightforward situation choking Steve (30:29 - 30:33)
up over there jeez I'm crying it's cuz I (30:31 - 30:35)
didn't get that ad deal bringing tears (30:33 - 30:37)
to my (30:35 - 30:39)
eyes I (30:37 - 30:41)
um but also (30:39 - 30:45)
like if it went live at 2 o'clock for (30:41 - 30:47)
you know everyone (30:45 - 30:50)
everyone at what point were they like oh (30:47 - 30:52)
this is wrong pull it like did they they (30:50 - 30:54)
they knew the ads were going to release (30:52 - 30:58)
at two so no one that morning like (30:54 - 30:59)
it just well there's more (30:58 - 31:01)
miscommunication that's about may they (30:59 - 31:03)
over slept I know yeah yeah maybe they (31:01 - 31:05)
over slept but I think uh I think a lot (31:03 - 31:06)
of the van Go stuff what we'll get to (31:05 - 31:10)
after the break was literally a lot of (31:06 - 31:13)
miscommunication um so real quick before (31:10 - 31:16)
the break though uh this Clefairy event (31:13 - 31:17)
I don't know if you guys have done it it (31:16 - 31:23)
was um clef's not normally found in um (31:17 - 31:25)
outbreaks will be in outbreaks in both (31:23 - 31:28)
kitakami and Pala you don't need the DLC (31:25 - 31:30)
uh they will be like boosted outbreaks (31:28 - 31:32)
and they will be more likely to have the (31:30 - 31:35)
upbeat Mark um which is a personality (31:32 - 31:37)
Mark which normally personality marks (31:35 - 31:38)
are about a one in 100 chance if you're (31:37 - 31:41)
just walking around catching (31:38 - 31:45)
Pokemon and uh it came out uh that 700 P (31:41 - 31:46)
p.m. central Time same time usually (31:45 - 31:49)
raids update which is midnight UTC and (31:46 - 31:53)
there were a lot of Clefairy outbreaks (31:49 - 31:55)
in both kakami and Pala and we found out (31:53 - 31:58)
through sarabe that the Mark itself the (31:55 - 32:01)
upbeat Mark was 5% so instead of 1 in (31:58 - 32:05)
100 it was a 1 in 20 chance to get on a (32:01 - 32:08)
Clefairy so no boosted shiny odds but (32:05 - 32:11)
outbreaks are already one of the best (32:08 - 32:14)
ways to get shiny Pokemon some would (32:11 - 32:18)
argue that it makes it too easy I (32:14 - 32:20)
wouldn't argue it's fine like I we're (32:18 - 32:22)
not here to judge people's different (32:20 - 32:24)
definitions of easy or hard when it (32:22 - 32:27)
comes to shiny hunting but um this (32:24 - 32:28)
should have been in the game since day (32:27 - 32:32)
one this was such a cool and fun event (32:28 - 32:34)
and I know people are like I don't like (32:32 - 32:36)
raids raids are too like they don't (32:34 - 32:37)
interest me they don't bring me back to (32:36 - 32:40)
the game seeing a bunch of Clefairy (32:37 - 32:43)
everywhere and everyone hunting the same (32:40 - 32:46)
Pokemon in the same weekend is (32:43 - 32:49)
awesome and they need to do this like (32:46 - 32:50)
once a month and they should have been (32:49 - 32:53)
doing this once a month where we're all (32:50 - 32:56)
like I don't know what you guys it's (32:53 - 32:58)
it's a much more independent thing in (32:56 - 33:00)
some ways but also a much more social (32:58 - 33:03)
thing in others letting people do things (33:00 - 33:05)
on their own if they want you can also (33:03 - 33:07)
go into someone else's game with the (33:05 - 33:10)
multiplayer but everybody wants to show (33:07 - 33:11)
off when they get the shiny Clif are (33:10 - 33:15)
especially if it has a mark MH this (33:11 - 33:17)
seems like a cool event I also love how (33:15 - 33:19)
they've been consistently doing Clefairy (33:17 - 33:21)
events for the moon festivals and things (33:19 - 33:22)
like that yeah we're GNA be sick of it (33:21 - 33:25)
in five years no it's it's not that (33:22 - 33:28)
frequent so it's nice (33:25 - 33:29)
yeah I uh I think that it's cool that (33:28 - 33:31)
they were boosting something other than (33:29 - 33:34)
a shiny rate also so putting an emphasis (33:31 - 33:38)
somewhere else um is cool just (33:34 - 33:41)
because you know I I think everyone not (33:38 - 33:42)
everyone but I think there's a lot of (33:41 - 33:44)
people that are like uh maybe we could (33:42 - 33:46)
like hunt it there's a different thing (33:44 - 33:48)
to hunt for rather than just hunting for (33:46 - 33:51)
the shiny um and so um having the (33:48 - 33:54)
increase I'm falling apart here I'm (33:51 - 33:56)
Fallen apart in this podcast I mean the (33:54 - 33:59)
increased Mark rate I think is cool um I (33:56 - 34:02)
didn't I didn't uh do anything with it (33:59 - 34:04)
um but it is I've been seeing it (34:02 - 34:08)
flooding uh Instagram Twitter threads (34:04 - 34:12)
all weekend so I that's very cool I um I (34:08 - 34:15)
also like I I do like when Pokemon pairs (34:12 - 34:16)
things together like we're we're (34:15 - 34:18)
introducing Clefairy and Pokemon sleep (34:16 - 34:20)
and we're putting Clefairy everywhere in (34:18 - 34:22)
scarlet and violet I they they do do (34:20 - 34:24)
sometimes with you know Pokemon go and (34:22 - 34:27)
and whatnot so I always do like when (34:24 - 34:29)
that (34:27 - 34:32)
happens um and (34:29 - 34:34)
hopefully and it seems like scarlet and (34:32 - 34:37)
violet is leaning more into marks um (34:34 - 34:39)
which is like an (34:37 - 34:41)
added and going back to whether shinies (34:39 - 34:44)
are easy or hard like I I ended up (34:41 - 34:48)
getting 16 shiny Clefairy it was my 16th (34:44 - 34:49)
one that had the (34:48 - 34:53)
mark so that was exciting that was Al (34:49 - 34:56)
also took like two full evening streams (34:53 - 34:58)
to do that but but I could easily see (34:56 - 35:00)
somebody going in being like I got my (34:58 - 35:02)
first chin Clefairy I'm so happy this is (35:00 - 35:06)
great and then other people being like I (35:02 - 35:07)
want as many as possible and other (35:06 - 35:09)
people want like I want the mark so I'm (35:07 - 35:11)
going to keep doing it so it does add a (35:09 - 35:14)
lot of different layers to playing the (35:11 - 35:17)
game that isn't specifically or or (35:14 - 35:18)
somebody could just go in and catch 20 (35:17 - 35:20)
and be like cool I got one not shiny but (35:18 - 35:23)
it has the mark that's all I wanted uh (35:20 - 35:26)
and that's that's great and like Hannah (35:23 - 35:28)
said you could join somebody else's game (35:26 - 35:29)
although that's a little (35:28 - 35:31)
laggy but if you didn't have the herb (35:29 - 35:34)
mystica you could join somebody's game (35:31 - 35:36)
um make a sandwich together and then (35:34 - 35:39)
leave your game and they can they could (35:36 - 35:40)
provide the herb Mystic for you and you (35:39 - 35:42)
could get the 30 minutes to hunt in your (35:40 - 35:44)
game so I really really hope they do (35:42 - 35:46)
more of this I totally understand if (35:44 - 35:48)
you're not raid focused how raids aren't (35:46 - 35:49)
bringing you back I think this is (35:48 - 35:52)
another cool thing they could do in like (35:49 - 35:55)
my perfect Pokemon weekend world it (35:52 - 35:56)
would be nice (35:55 - 35:59)
for you know like a SE one sevenstar (35:56 - 36:03)
raid a month one like blissy Slither (35:59 - 36:05)
Wings whatever like not that important (36:03 - 36:08)
raids but something new uh and then like (36:05 - 36:12)
one of these outbreaks a month um yeah I (36:08 - 36:15)
I do like that there is less need for (36:12 - 36:17)
preparation for something like this (36:15 - 36:20)
right I mean I I definitely can see and (36:17 - 36:22)
have felt like with a raid being like (36:20 - 36:25)
okay hold on now I got to go and luckily (36:22 - 36:26)
you like we there's people like you who (36:25 - 36:28)
are like here's a raid build and so it's (36:26 - 36:30)
like okay like I can go and at least see (36:28 - 36:33)
what Steve says to build but there still (36:30 - 36:34)
is that preparation of building a (36:33 - 36:36)
Pokemon and if you're not playing that (36:34 - 36:38)
often it might not be as easy to build (36:36 - 36:41)
that Pokemon or or whatever so with (36:38 - 36:42)
something like this it's just another (36:41 - 36:45)
fun event but it doesn't need you know (36:42 - 36:47)
time to prepare something beforehand you (36:45 - 36:49)
can kind of just jump into it and and (36:47 - 36:51)
have a good time yeah and with the huge (36:49 - 36:53)
outbreaks like this it's a little bit (36:51 - 36:56)
different from I mean I already said it (36:53 - 36:58)
but you want want to share the shiny (36:56 - 37:00)
you've caught or you want to share the (36:58 - 37:01)
shiny with the mark when it's this kind (37:00 - 37:04)
of a event and that's super exciting you (37:01 - 37:07)
don't necessarily want to share a raid (37:04 - 37:10)
boss you've caught like you have it you (37:07 - 37:11)
could but you don't need to share a (37:10 - 37:14)
picture of it I think I think though to (37:11 - 37:16)
your point Hannah which is 100% right (37:14 - 37:18)
right I think if you you're on social (37:16 - 37:20)
media in some form and you're seeing (37:18 - 37:23)
like oh so and so got a bombarder Bobby (37:20 - 37:25)
got a cloth like that's just like normal (37:23 - 37:27)
people sharing shinies but if if you're (37:25 - 37:29)
going into a weekend of like everyone's (37:27 - 37:31)
getting shiny Clefairy that is like (37:29 - 37:33)
really good that's like a Community Day (37:31 - 37:35)
right right it it's the closest to a (37:33 - 37:39)
community day mhm that in a main Series (37:35 - 37:43)
game that really like I loved it I I (37:39 - 37:45)
dropped everything what I I didn't I had (37:43 - 37:48)
low expectations as some people should (37:45 - 37:50)
for scarlet Violet but this was (37:48 - 37:53)
genuinely one of the best things they (37:50 - 37:56)
have done in a long time and I you know (37:53 - 37:59)
I love Seven Star raids too and like if (37:56 - 38:01)
it wasn't for seven star raids and it (37:59 - 38:02)
wasn't for some other stuff of scarlet (38:01 - 38:03)
and violet I would have probably stopped (38:02 - 38:07)
playing it but now like I'm hoping that (38:03 - 38:09)
this is like a week U not a weekly well (38:07 - 38:10)
whatever you want to do a weekly that's (38:09 - 38:13)
fine I'm hoping that this is a monthly (38:10 - 38:15)
thing that they do I am (38:13 - 38:20)
also curious with the indigo disc coming (38:15 - 38:23)
um whether the starters will be featured (38:20 - 38:25)
in these outbreaks they did say we could (38:23 - 38:27)
catch the starters but they didn't say (38:25 - 38:30)
how we could catch the (38:27 - 38:30)
starters so if they're doing like this (38:31 - 38:35)
weekend is Charmander outbreak would (38:33 - 38:38)
take so long that would but they it (38:35 - 38:41)
would take so long especially if it's (38:38 - 38:44)
once a month weekly could be weekly (38:41 - 38:48)
could be could be St could we doing (38:44 - 38:50)
charmand this week bu but uh look if (38:48 - 38:51)
there's something that could bring (38:50 - 38:55)
people back Charmander outbreak yeah I (38:51 - 38:57)
mean this really is the closest they (38:55 - 39:00)
have to Community Days mhm mhm and it (38:57 - 39:01)
seems to be (39:00 - 39:04)
working look you want the five Ted Pig (39:01 - 39:06)
fans in the world to buy your video game (39:04 - 39:08)
T Pig outbreak they'll do it in a (39:06 - 39:11)
heartbeat $60 done this is how they're (39:08 - 39:14)
going to sell more um gosh there's so (39:11 - 39:17)
many little things in news finally again (39:14 - 39:19)
before we go to the break there is the (39:17 - 39:22)
scarlet and violet collection with the (39:19 - 39:25)
DLC coming out November 3rd that does (39:22 - 39:28)
not mean the IND go dis is coming out (39:25 - 39:30)
November 3rd I don't know what that (39:28 - 39:32)
means well I do know what that means it (39:30 - 39:34)
means we need to get a physical product (39:32 - 39:36)
on the Shelf before Black Friday which (39:34 - 39:38)
is I think what we said last (39:36 - 39:41)
week they're going to have it yep who (39:38 - 39:43)
knows if it's going to have the second (39:41 - 39:47)
DLC so um I think we know that the (39:43 - 39:49)
second DLC won't actually be on the (39:47 - 39:52)
cartridge so whether the DLC comes out (39:49 - 39:55)
November 3rd or November 1st or November (39:52 - 39:57)
20th it will need to be updated (39:55 - 40:00)
so that's really unfortunate for people (39:57 - 40:03)
who I don't know bought the double pack (40:00 - 40:06)
and live out in the woods and had no (40:03 - 40:07)
intention of connecting to the internet (40:06 - 40:08)
because the only thing on that is the (40:07 - 40:11)
teal mask until you actually connect to (40:08 - 40:14)
the internet when the DLC comes out so I (40:11 - 40:16)
get it though I get it from a (40:14 - 40:19)
manufacturing standpoint of we're making (40:16 - 40:22)
all these carts they need to be out we (40:19 - 40:24)
can only put them on a boat or ship them (40:22 - 40:26)
or put them on a plane to get them to (40:24 - 40:28)
countryes before this day if we have (40:26 - 40:31)
them sitting in a warehouse any longer (40:28 - 40:34)
that's going to cost us x a day and it's (40:31 - 40:37)
just not worth it so we're this is the (40:34 - 40:40)
day we're releasing it to optimize our (40:37 - 40:44)
our Revenue I I get it um you want it (40:40 - 40:45)
before Black (40:44 - 40:49)
Friday but to the people who very few of (40:45 - 40:51)
them have zero internet and have no (40:49 - 40:53)
plans of connecting to the internet uh (40:51 - 40:56)
it does suck buying a quote unquote (40:53 - 40:59)
finalized product that (40:56 - 41:03)
isn't there analyze yeah yeah um did (40:59 - 41:08)
sword and shield have a DLC version of a (41:03 - 41:11)
physical copy that had both and it had (41:08 - 41:13)
both had both on there yeah it came out (41:11 - 41:16)
because the second one came out October (41:13 - 41:18)
22nd of that year I believe right so (41:16 - 41:21)
then if they could so that worked out (41:18 - 41:22)
well because they could still before (41:21 - 41:25)
Black Friday looking at the photos of (41:22 - 41:27)
this one for scarlet but Violet though (41:25 - 41:29)
it does just straight up say additional (41:27 - 41:30)
download (41:29 - 41:33)
required on the box yeah so that's at (41:30 - 41:36)
least helpful I mean yeah they're being (41:33 - 41:38)
upfront about it they're trying to be (41:36 - 41:40)
very clear about it yeah this wouldn't (41:38 - 41:41)
be a problem if they just released the (41:40 - 41:43)
first one in the summer like they were (41:41 - 41:45)
supposed to yeah I think I think it was (41:43 - 41:47)
probably supposed to be summer November (41:45 - 41:48)
uh and we (41:47 - 41:52)
got September maybe still November (41:48 - 41:54)
December I I I still think they'll (41:52 - 41:56)
probably try to aim for the the the (41:54 - 41:57)
November I still think they'll probably (41:56 - 41:59)
try to aim for that week before Black (41:57 - 42:04)
Friday um nobody wants nobody in Japan (41:59 - 42:07)
America Canada Etc wants to be working (42:04 - 42:09)
after Thanksgiving and before the (42:07 - 42:13)
holidays and all of that stuff (42:09 - 42:15)
but (42:13 - 42:18)
um I think the other thing that maybe (42:15 - 42:21)
this confirms I don't know why well I do (42:18 - 42:24)
okay so let's rewind back to sword and (42:21 - 42:27)
shield where people were like can't wait (42:24 - 42:29)
for the third DLC to finish adding the (42:27 - 42:33)
rest of the Pok√©mon and that never (42:29 - 42:35)
happened and they also put out a final (42:33 - 42:38)
version called the DLC double pack with (42:35 - 42:40)
both the (42:38 - 42:42)
dlc's I don't think there's going to be (42:40 - 42:44)
a third version of scarlet and violet I (42:42 - 42:46)
don't think there's going to be in a (42:44 - 42:48)
year well here's another physical (42:46 - 42:52)
version with the third (42:48 - 42:55)
DLC they're gonna finish it up they're (42:52 - 42:57)
going to move past it (42:55 - 43:00)
yeah and even (42:57 - 43:02)
even even if like I don't I don't even (43:00 - 43:05)
want a third version just like even for (43:02 - 43:07)
the people that still believe that (43:05 - 43:09)
Callos is right there we're going to (43:07 - 43:11)
Callos it's right there third version of (43:09 - 43:13)
the DLC going to take us to third (43:11 - 43:15)
version's going to add Mega Pokemon even (43:13 - 43:18)
if you want that I get why you want that (43:15 - 43:21)
I under I feel your Callos Fanboys I'm (43:18 - 43:24)
with you I love everything about X and Y (43:21 - 43:25)
minus the (43:24 - 43:27)
story I would also like to go back to (43:25 - 43:30)
Callos I don't want to go back to Callos (43:27 - 43:32)
at 14 frames a second on the scarlet and (43:30 - 43:34)
violet engine I would like to explore (43:32 - 43:38)
that again maybe at least a solid 30 (43:34 - 43:40)
like it's fine we don't need a third DLC (43:38 - 43:43)
it's okay the callow stream will (43:40 - 43:47)
eventually come in two four six years I (43:43 - 43:50)
don't know maybe who knows black and (43:47 - 43:52)
white probably first six years away (43:50 - 43:54)
probably I would have guess atast (43:52 - 43:58)
like I think it I think you the ship is (43:54 - 44:01)
sailed just finish this (43:58 - 44:05)
DLC do your your outbreaks do your raid (44:01 - 44:07)
events for the next year or (44:05 - 44:11)
two work on gen 10 just start over I (44:07 - 44:14)
don't know like the raid events for the (44:11 - 44:16)
next year or two when you say that I get (44:14 - 44:18)
a little bit like uh that makes me a (44:16 - 44:21)
little tired like I The Raid events in (44:18 - 44:23)
sword and shield worked really well and (44:21 - 44:25)
or like not events but like just the way (44:23 - 44:27)
that the The Raid worked in sword and (44:25 - 44:29)
shield really worked well for (44:27 - 44:33)
repeatability um I'm not like and I mean (44:29 - 44:34)
I'm not like I'm not someone who doesn't (44:33 - 44:36)
typically play Pokemon games or anything (44:34 - 44:38)
but like raing in scarlet and violet is (44:36 - 44:41)
not I don't know it's just not the (44:38 - 44:43)
greatest like I can't I just can't (44:41 - 44:46)
picture myself doing that for two more (44:43 - 44:48)
years I don't know maybe it's me I just (44:46 - 44:52)
don't see a magical 30 FPS patch no no (44:48 - 44:54)
no no no I'm not even saying that I'm (44:52 - 44:55)
just saying I also can't see myself (44:54 - 44:59)
rating as Scarlet viol for two (44:55 - 44:59)
years yeah I mean I hope there's a bunch (45:00 - 45:04)
of stuff to do in the teal mask I hope (45:02 - 45:08)
it's twice three times bigger than oh (45:04 - 45:11)
sorry the Indigo disc than the teal mask (45:08 - 45:14)
um but (45:11 - 45:16)
I I'm I'm okay with them saying like we (45:14 - 45:18)
could either put two more months into (45:16 - 45:19)
scarlet and violet and fix it or we (45:18 - 45:21)
could put those two more months into gen (45:19 - 45:24)
10 or whatever and whatever's coming (45:21 - 45:26)
next I would rather have whatever's (45:24 - 45:28)
coming next I'm I'm okay I would rather (45:26 - 45:31)
have whatever's coming next be better (45:28 - 45:34)
yes yeah that's the important part and (45:31 - 45:36)
you got to say that part if there's a (45:34 - 45:39)
small Silver Lining hopefully that this (45:36 - 45:43)
was the okay we bid off more than we (45:39 - 45:46)
could chew we learned from our mistakes (45:43 - 45:48)
not going to happen again and they' (45:46 - 45:51)
mentioned it and it's still a good game (45:48 - 45:52)
but I am hoping they've learned from (45:51 - 45:56)
some of the feedback they've gotten yeah (45:52 - 45:57)
I mean (45:56 - 46:00)
it I'll give them the benefit of and (45:57 - 46:02)
it's been said before we've said it (46:00 - 46:04)
before but like first open world game (46:02 - 46:07)
that they've done like it's different (46:04 - 46:09)
than what they've done (46:07 - 46:12)
before and it wasn't I heard there the (46:09 - 46:15)
most trainers ever in this game too (46:12 - 46:16)
maybe that's the problem right maybe (46:15 - 46:17)
they were like we're doing open world (46:16 - 46:20)
300 trainers they was like we should (46:17 - 46:21)
have just done one or the other there (46:20 - 46:23)
300 trainers in no open world or open (46:21 - 46:25)
world with no trainers the next update (46:23 - 46:28)
just removes the trainers the frame rate (46:25 - 46:32)
runs better everything is fixed me you (46:28 - 46:34)
don't need them they're not providing (46:32 - 46:37)
anything there were like nine trainers (46:34 - 46:40)
in legends archus that game a lot better (46:37 - 46:42)
love that game so I would take that (46:40 - 46:44)
tradeoff (46:42 - 46:48)
yep can I go into the EOP and pay like (46:44 - 46:51)
$4.99 to turn off trainers but to boost (46:48 - 46:55)
my frame rate I will pay it I pay $25 in (46:51 - 46:58)
sleep I will pay $5 for better frame (46:55 - 47:03)
rate I want less gam playay (46:58 - 47:06)
please uh all right uh let's take a (47:03 - 47:08)
break when come back uh we're going to (47:06 - 47:10)
talk about the van Go stuff which I (47:08 - 47:12)
think is the mo most of the segment so (47:10 - 47:16)
we will be right back and we are back (47:12 - 47:17)
from our (47:16 - 47:19)
break well before we get to the van Go (47:17 - 47:22)
stuff which is sad in its own way we got (47:19 - 47:24)
some sad news which is the Pokemon (47:22 - 47:27)
Trading Card Game (47:24 - 47:29)
Dex is sun (47:27 - 47:33)
setting which if you've listened to the (47:29 - 47:35)
show I couldn't stand this (47:33 - 47:37)
app I think the last time we talked (47:35 - 47:39)
about this app Bobby was on and Bobby (47:37 - 47:41)
had Alternatives but at (47:39 - 47:45)
10 a.m. on September 20th the oh they (47:41 - 47:47)
it's gone (47:45 - 47:51)
uh 10 days ago (47:47 - 47:54)
oops uh they they gave people two they (47:51 - 47:55)
gave people a two we notice not that you (47:54 - 47:57)
could do anything with any of that (47:55 - 47:59)
information um but the trading card game (47:57 - 48:02)
a will app will be removed from the App (47:59 - 48:05)
Store and Google Play Store the TCG card (48:02 - 48:07)
decks allowed players to scan their card (48:05 - 48:09)
to document their (48:07 - 48:12)
collection my problem with this is there (48:09 - 48:15)
was no way to save anything no Cloud (48:12 - 48:20)
save no local save no account save most (48:15 - 48:23)
apps you could heck link your Facebook (48:20 - 48:25)
and Facebook will save your (48:23 - 48:27)
stuff maybe not the the best way to do (48:25 - 48:29)
it but still a way to I think Pok√©mon go (48:27 - 48:31)
still uses Facebook as a possible login (48:29 - 48:37)
it is one L method um so if I was to buy (48:31 - 48:40)
if if I was to bought an iPhone 15 which (48:37 - 48:42)
I did not um and I wanted to move from (48:40 - 48:45)
my 14 to my 15 literally I lose (48:42 - 48:48)
everything there's nothing I could do to (48:45 - 48:51)
remember what I scanned so I don't know (48:48 - 48:53)
why your job would be to scan all of (48:51 - 48:57)
your Pokemon cards again yeah that's (48:53 - 48:59)
awful and they have so many games where (48:57 - 49:01)
you can do that right like how many of (48:59 - 49:05)
their games even okay so I I did buy a (49:01 - 49:08)
new iPhone and I had to transfer uh some (49:05 - 49:13)
stuff from my 14 to the 15 and uh I was (49:08 - 49:16)
able to transfer Pokemon smile data for (49:13 - 49:18)
teeth cleaning because both of my kids (49:16 - 49:21)
play use my phone to play Pokemon smile (49:18 - 49:23)
and I was able to transfer all their (49:21 - 49:24)
Pokemon that they've caught over to the (49:23 - 49:26)
new phone because they just have that (49:24 - 49:29)
like transfer data button gives you the (49:26 - 49:32)
like the code and the um key and then (49:29 - 49:34)
you just put that data into the new into (49:32 - 49:36)
the app on the other phone and it just (49:34 - 49:39)
transfers it right over so I don't know (49:36 - 49:43)
how they didn't just do that for this (49:39 - 49:48)
app the app looked visually good yeah it (49:43 - 49:52)
was a great looking app it just had no (49:48 - 49:57)
settings or anything yeah to remember (49:52 - 49:59)
your collection I don't it's and it (49:57 - 50:02)
wasn't that old right no no it wasn't (49:59 - 50:05)
that old maybe I think it came out end a (50:02 - 50:06)
sun and moon start a sword and shield (50:05 - 50:08)
maybe (50:06 - 50:10)
yeah but if if if your camera is (50:08 - 50:12)
scanning the card and the card is in the (50:10 - 50:15)
database and it's adding the image to (50:12 - 50:18)
your collection how is there just not (50:15 - 50:23)
even a simple export a txt file to (50:18 - 50:26)
generate a code to then like Pokemon (50:23 - 50:29)
smile mhm enter the code to be like yep (50:26 - 50:33)
here is a 2 kilobyte file remembering (50:29 - 50:35)
your collection and popping it back up (50:33 - 50:38)
again yeah who did they hire SL pay who (50:35 - 50:42)
worked on this app why would why why I (50:38 - 50:44)
think that's the problem is no one did (50:42 - 50:45)
work and then every time a set came out (50:44 - 50:47)
they just had to hit like upload new set (50:45 - 50:49)
we're good nobody has to actually work (50:47 - 50:51)
on this app or update it or do anything (50:49 - 50:54)
it visually looked so great (50:51 - 50:58)
yeah yeah that's but why Sunset it make (50:54 - 50:59)
it (50:58 - 51:02)
better when the lack of one feature is (50:59 - 51:05)
what kills the app yeah I mean the (51:02 - 51:08)
alternatives are I mean I do use an (51:05 - 51:10)
alternative app that is very very good (51:08 - 51:12)
and they actually just added a scan (51:10 - 51:13)
feature if you do want to scan your (51:12 - 51:16)
cards but like um and I know a couple (51:13 - 51:19)
other apps that are also very very good (51:16 - 51:21)
so they should just like buy those (51:19 - 51:24)
people's apps or something I don't know (51:21 - 51:25)
do something so that you have your own (51:24 - 51:28)
official app but um the Alternatives (51:25 - 51:31)
that I use like I pay for an app that's (51:28 - 51:32)
how good the app is I actually pay a (51:31 - 51:35)
subscription for this app so that I can (51:32 - 51:37)
um you have to justify here Bobby I just (51:35 - 51:40)
paid $25 Pokemon sleep yeah true we're (51:37 - 51:42)
in a safe place right now I am awake I (51:40 - 51:45)
am awake while I use the majority of the (51:42 - 51:49)
time I use that um but you know like (51:45 - 51:51)
there are good Alternatives and it is (51:49 - 51:54)
unfortunate that they don't have an (51:51 - 51:56)
official app um with that they did but (51:54 - 51:58)
it's unfortunate that that's gone away (51:56 - 52:00)
um and that there was never a way to (51:58 - 52:02)
save anything on it because it's so on (52:00 - 52:03)
every other app they have they have way (52:02 - 52:06)
to save things so even as a very casual (52:03 - 52:08)
collector I was tempted to use that app (52:06 - 52:11)
but without any sort of transfer or save (52:08 - 52:12)
or (52:11 - 52:15)
anything kind of ruined it it kind of (52:12 - 52:18)
killed the whole app yeah I mean as a (52:15 - 52:21)
Card Collector we do a lot of like (52:18 - 52:23)
having to redo things whether that's (52:21 - 52:25)
rearrange a binder or rearrange it so (52:23 - 52:27)
like maybe they were just going with the (52:25 - 52:29)
spirit of like all these people are used (52:27 - 52:30)
to like redoing things all the time (52:29 - 52:33)
anyways so who cares if if somebody (52:30 - 52:35)
internally was like man this app is not (52:33 - 52:37)
getting any downloads let's just Sunset (52:35 - 52:41)
it we all I hope you know why it wasn't (52:37 - 52:43)
getting downloads because it was lacking (52:41 - 52:46)
the most critical feature to adding a (52:43 - 52:48)
collection (52:46 - 52:51)
somewhere like that's it that's all it (52:48 - 52:54)
was missing I (52:51 - 52:59)
I'm jeez you charge people this company (52:54 - 53:01)
charges people to move more than like (52:59 - 53:04)
three shinies from Pok√©mon go to Pokemon (53:01 - 53:05)
home a (53:04 - 53:09)
week you you don't act like you you're (53:05 - 53:10)
high in money and you don't want to (53:09 - 53:12)
charge people to export their card (53:10 - 53:14)
collection just charge me 99 Cents then (53:12 - 53:17)
if you want me to move my card anything (53:14 - 53:19)
please (53:17 - 53:22)
MH like you know your audience will pay (53:19 - 53:24)
for (53:22 - 53:28)
it don't give them that (53:24 - 53:30)
idea yeah maybe they're just going to (53:28 - 53:32)
come back with a sub transfer from phone (53:30 - 53:35)
to phone that's a little different yeah (53:32 - 53:37)
but (53:35 - 53:41)
something $25 a year every six months (53:37 - 53:43)
now to keep your card (53:41 - 53:47)
collection I feel like there must be (53:43 - 53:50)
some internal turmoil happening (53:47 - 53:52)
everything card related at this company (53:50 - 53:55)
TCG shutting down and then going to TCG (53:52 - 53:58)
live is has not been a smooth experience (53:55 - 54:01)
or an enjoyable experience to their (53:58 - 54:03)
customers this getting shut down really (54:01 - 54:06)
not that big of a deal although like it (54:03 - 54:09)
has one of the easiest fixes it would (54:06 - 54:11)
have been a big deal if it had that one (54:09 - 54:14)
feature (54:11 - 54:17)
yeah and then we that takes us to the (54:14 - 54:21)
van Go stuff which uh last week we (54:17 - 54:23)
talked about the (54:21 - 54:27)
$400 um TCG (54:23 - 54:29)
live or sorry (54:27 - 54:33)
TCG classic I think it's called $400 it (54:29 - 54:37)
was at Pokemon Center um I'm assuming (54:33 - 54:39)
scalpers bought it some scalpers bought (54:37 - 54:41)
it because then it went up on eBay and (54:39 - 54:43)
they were like buy it now for $700 but (54:41 - 54:46)
it didn't look like they were moving and (54:43 - 54:47)
I think Bobby can also verify they were (54:46 - 54:49)
not moving because you can find these (54:47 - 54:53)
way cheaper elsewhere yeah I mean I I (54:49 - 54:56)
way cheaper but they are already (54:53 - 54:58)
before even coming out I've seen them (54:56 - 55:03)
for 10% less at smaller retailers and (54:58 - 55:06)
that typically turns into even deeper (55:03 - 55:08)
discounts when the things do come out (55:06 - 55:11)
like that's kind of been the pattern for (55:08 - 55:14)
this era of cards like starting at the (55:11 - 55:16)
beginning of the year with the I'll tell (55:14 - 55:17)
you where it started it started before (55:16 - 55:19)
that it started with that Charizard (55:17 - 55:22)
premium collection yes it did that is (55:19 - 55:26)
what started it all people put bought (55:22 - 55:27)
those Charizard collections put them on (55:26 - 55:30)
eBay for like five times the price they (55:27 - 55:32)
didn't move people were so panicky that (55:30 - 55:34)
they weren't going to get it and then (55:32 - 55:37)
you could walk into a Target and the (55:34 - 55:40)
entire aisle was littered with them at (55:37 - 55:43)
discount and Target normally doesn't (55:40 - 55:46)
discount etbs or boxes they couldn't get (55:43 - 55:48)
rid of these Charizard etbs which on one (55:46 - 55:51)
hand they're still there almost a year (55:48 - 55:54)
later they still can't get rid of all (55:51 - 55:56)
the product of those char Charizard UPC (55:54 - 56:00)
on one hand that is fantastic M for (55:56 - 56:01)
somebody who wants to walk in and get a (56:00 - 56:05)
Charizard and it it screwed over a lot (56:01 - 56:09)
of card shops who expected to move these (56:05 - 56:11)
it it ruined it or not ruined but I'm (56:09 - 56:16)
sure the scalpers ate that cost because (56:11 - 56:19)
they couldn't move them so there's it so (56:16 - 56:20)
even so it actually goes back a little (56:19 - 56:22)
bit further than that because it all (56:20 - 56:24)
actually starts with how hard it was to (56:22 - 56:27)
get the collection box collection box (56:24 - 56:30)
for celebrations the 25th anniversary (56:27 - 56:34)
set because that was so hard to come by (56:30 - 56:37)
everyone thought the next collection box (56:34 - 56:40)
being Charizard related was going to be (56:37 - 56:43)
just as hard as the celebration one was (56:40 - 56:45)
except in that time frame Pokemon was (56:43 - 56:48)
probably like oh we need to make this (56:45 - 56:49)
easier for people to get so we're going (56:48 - 56:51)
to print and make way more of them and (56:49 - 56:53)
so because they don't they don't make (56:51 - 56:55)
anything on the secondary market so they (56:53 - 56:57)
could just get more money by making more (56:55 - 56:59)
exactly well and then so what happened (56:57 - 57:01)
was like you said everyone thought they (56:59 - 57:03)
were going to be hard to get so even (57:01 - 57:05)
those smaller shops started actually (57:03 - 57:08)
pricing them higher on pre-order and (57:05 - 57:10)
customers started buying them from those (57:08 - 57:11)
smaller shops at a higher price so you (57:10 - 57:14)
were seeing people buy a collection box (57:11 - 57:17)
at $250 $200 $250 for something that was (57:14 - 57:20)
$1 120 and then when it when they (57:17 - 57:21)
realized there were so many of them (57:20 - 57:23)
those card shops kind of had to (57:21 - 57:25)
apologize to their customers because it (57:23 - 57:27)
looked like they price gouged them and (57:25 - 57:29)
it's like they they're not like scalp (57:27 - 57:30)
they don't want to be the people because (57:29 - 57:32)
those customers will just walk away and (57:30 - 57:34)
go to Target Best Buy and be like I can (57:32 - 57:35)
just buy this for the normal price or (57:34 - 57:37)
discounted price and so it really kind (57:35 - 57:40)
of hit everyone kind of got affected in (57:37 - 57:43)
some way by those Charizard upcs which (57:40 - 57:45)
again are still available at discounted (57:43 - 57:48)
prices every so before this show Bobby (57:45 - 57:51)
sent me a couple L Links of the TCG (57:48 - 57:55)
classic being 360 at just local places (57:51 - 57:58)
yep like I think you also have a problem (57:55 - 58:00)
with these bigger sets that they just (57:58 - 58:01)
take up a lot of (58:00 - 58:06)
space and like like you're if you're a (58:01 - 58:08)
small card shop or even if you're a (58:06 - 58:12)
Target you don't want a bunch of unsold (58:08 - 58:13)
product just sitting around taking up (58:12 - 58:16)
space m um (58:13 - 58:21)
so that is that is a good sign to a (58:16 - 58:23)
consumer being like I want this but it's (58:21 - 58:25)
too expensive that's a bad B sign for a (58:23 - 58:27)
scalper which is a good sign for (58:25 - 58:29)
everyone else um but it doesn't look (58:27 - 58:31)
like they're moving on (58:29 - 58:34)
eBay um and if they're already (58:31 - 58:36)
discounted a 360 (58:34 - 58:39)
pre-order I still think that's too much (58:36 - 58:44)
mhm I maybe around 200 250 I feel like I (58:39 - 58:45)
would pull the trigger but I'm waiting (58:44 - 58:46)
this one out and if you're listening to (58:45 - 58:49)
the show you should too like obviously (58:46 - 58:52)
400 I think is a lot for people it's (58:49 - 58:54)
your own money spend it your way but um (58:52 - 58:55)
you can find it cheaper lit literally (58:54 - 58:57)
right now you you can find local card (58:55 - 59:00)
shops or um if you're in the slack I'm (58:57 - 59:01)
sure Bobby will give you the link but (59:00 - 59:05)
like you can find them for 360 is plus (59:01 - 59:07)
tax and they'll get lower like that's (59:05 - 59:09)
the thing that's the that's the pattern (59:07 - 59:11)
with all of this is that it starts off (59:09 - 59:15)
at a price and if the local card shops (59:11 - 59:17)
are starting to sell it at a lower (59:15 - 59:19)
price you have to kind of watch it a (59:17 - 59:21)
little bit but like as it gets closer to (59:19 - 59:23)
November if you start to see that kind (59:21 - 59:25)
of just stay at that or a little bit (59:23 - 59:28)
lower then what's going to happen is the (59:25 - 59:31)
big box stores like GameStops and (59:28 - 59:33)
targets and things they have to start to (59:31 - 59:35)
decide whether they want to start (59:33 - 59:36)
discounting because like people start (59:35 - 59:38)
waiting things out and then when people (59:36 - 59:40)
start waiting things out the product is (59:38 - 59:42)
there ready to go but people are now (59:40 - 59:44)
waiting it out so people want to move it (59:42 - 59:45)
and so then the discounts come in a (59:44 - 59:47)
little bit and it just kind of all (59:45 - 59:51)
snowballs um so I would definitely say I (59:47 - 59:54)
mean again I think that the secondary (59:51 - 59:56)
market like eBay seeing no movement on (59:54 - 59:58)
these things for more than 400 shows (59:56 - 60:02)
like people are like uh it's really nice (59:58 - 60:04)
it looks really nice but it's base set (60:02 - 60:08)
again which we've seen nine times and (60:04 - 60:10)
it's not playable cards cards it's you (60:08 - 60:14)
know and um I did like the the (60:10 - 60:16)
comparison to like a really nice chess (60:14 - 60:17)
set last week that you guys were talking (60:16 - 60:19)
about I totally I like I agree with that (60:17 - 60:22)
like idea where it's (60:19 - 60:25)
almost like really nice chess set which (60:22 - 60:26)
I would say people who have a really (60:25 - 60:28)
nice chest set in their home or whatever (60:26 - 60:30)
it can be playable but it's also there (60:28 - 60:32)
for like display purposes and it's more (60:30 - 60:34)
of kind of like you know and I kind of (60:32 - 60:37)
see this as that to some extent I don't (60:34 - 60:41)
know how much TCG collectors in a lot of (60:37 - 60:44)
ways are looking for something like that (60:41 - 60:46)
I think there is a small percentage that (60:44 - 60:48)
might but I think for the most part (60:46 - 60:50)
that's not really where people are (60:48 - 60:52)
trying to go when spending their money (60:50 - 60:56)
on cards um but I I I do think you'll (60:52 - 60:58)
see some people obviously who want that (60:56 - 60:59)
you did I mean it's already sold out in (60:58 - 61:02)
a lot of ways and who knows if that's a (60:59 - 61:04)
lot of scalpers or not but the fact that (61:02 - 61:05)
you're just already seeing it discount (61:04 - 61:07)
at other places is a little bit uh (61:05 - 61:09)
telling for what's maybe to (61:07 - 61:12)
come yeah it was priced as luxury it was (61:09 - 61:15)
introduced as luxury it may not be (61:12 - 61:19)
marketed very well as luxury um but it's (61:15 - 61:20)
definitely not (61:19 - 61:23)
being accepted in the way they wanted it (61:20 - 61:25)
to be I think people aren't play as (61:23 - 61:30)
interested in it as spot on yep I think (61:25 - 61:33)
uh I think this is this this was out of (61:30 - 61:37)
a lot of people's normal Pokemon price (61:33 - 61:40)
range oh yeah they were hoping for the (61:37 - 61:42)
they were hoping for that big three Tac (61:40 - 61:43)
than just people being like Charizard (61:42 - 61:46)
Blastoise Venusaur got to get the set (61:43 - 61:48)
got you know it's the it's the old (61:46 - 61:50)
Charizard Blastoise Venusaur and I don't (61:48 - 61:52)
think it hit in the same way that maybe (61:50 - 61:54)
maybe we're wrong I mean they again they (61:52 - 61:57)
are sold out on Pokemon right like but (61:54 - 61:59)
yeah I mean I think I think if you're if (61:57 - 62:01)
you're uh you know if you're a smaller (61:59 - 62:03)
shop and I remember I remember walking (62:01 - 62:06)
into my local game (62:03 - 62:08)
store card game store and looking up on (62:06 - 62:10)
the wall behind them and they had the (62:08 - 62:14)
Pokemon 25 Anniversary (62:10 - 62:16)
Collection That was supposed to be 120 (62:14 - 62:18)
and they had it priced at (62:16 - 62:23)
460 um and you know I moved I ended up (62:18 - 62:25)
moving out of Milwaukee a month later so (62:23 - 62:27)
I actually don't know it was there a (62:25 - 62:29)
whole month so I don't know if it how (62:27 - 62:30)
when it sold or if they discounted (62:29 - 62:33)
afterwards but the reason that these (62:30 - 62:35)
card shops can sell them for 360 and not (62:33 - 62:38)
400 is because they buy bulk so they (62:35 - 62:41)
might have bought 20 or 40 or 60 of them (62:38 - 62:44)
and they probably bought them at $250 or (62:41 - 62:47)
$300 so they're still making a profit (62:44 - 62:48)
but if they're already discounting them (62:47 - 62:50)
it's it means that no one's pre-ordering (62:48 - 62:52)
them it means that now they they're (62:50 - 62:55)
panicking that they're not moving these (62:52 - 62:57)
units and once they come in and if (62:55 - 62:59)
people aren't picking them up that (62:57 - 63:02)
day they're sitting somewhere probably (62:59 - 63:04)
in the back where you don't want them (63:02 - 63:07)
sitting yeah and I think the problem now (63:04 - 63:10)
especially with the smaller stores is (63:07 - 63:13)
that the regular sets aren't selling for (63:10 - 63:15)
the prices that you know the prices went (63:13 - 63:19)
up in the Scarlet Violet era and MSRP on (63:15 - 63:22)
a booster box is $160 for regular set (63:19 - 63:24)
there is not a smaller shop that I've (63:22 - 63:25)
shopped at that's sells you a booster (63:24 - 63:30)
box for $160 it is 110 is the highest I (63:25 - 63:31)
paid for a booster box from a smaller (63:30 - 63:34)
shop and I know there are some that do (63:31 - 63:36)
still sell them at a higher price but (63:34 - 63:39)
the Distributors increase the prices on (63:36 - 63:41)
these items when the when the MSRP went (63:39 - 63:45)
up so these shops are making less money (63:41 - 63:47)
on their the products that they're (63:45 - 63:48)
selling they're still selling them at (63:47 - 63:50)
the price they were selling these things (63:48 - 63:51)
at last year but they had to pay more (63:50 - 63:54)
for these items M so I think that in (63:51 - 63:56)
itself self is making things tougher and (63:54 - 63:59)
then when you have a a special set like (63:56 - 64:02)
the classic thing coming out and they're (63:59 - 64:03)
going to be like we need to see these (64:02 - 64:06)
moving quickly or you know or we're (64:03 - 64:08)
going to be going to have to discount (64:06 - 64:09)
them a little bit because they don't (64:08 - 64:11)
want to lose money on they don't want to (64:09 - 64:13)
lose money on those on top of what (64:11 - 64:16)
everything else is going (64:13 - 64:16)
through so Pokemon announced a (64:16 - 64:22)
partnership with uh van (64:19 - 64:25)
go with the museum the museum the museum (64:22 - 64:27)
you know they've been working out for (64:25 - 64:29)
170 (64:27 - 64:33)
years the man has they cut off his own (64:29 - 64:34)
ear and he's still putting out artwork (64:33 - 64:37)
he's still making business (64:34 - 64:39)
deals (64:37 - 64:43)
um this was uh I think this was a pretty (64:39 - 64:46)
well-kept secret it kind of just (64:43 - 64:48)
announced and it was like Hey you know (64:46 - 64:49)
you're going to be able to buy tickets (64:48 - 64:50)
to go to this (64:49 - 64:55)
Museum um hear some of the stuff but man (64:50 - 64:57)
the communication around (64:55 - 65:01)
this was insanely (64:57 - 65:04)
bad um (65:01 - 65:08)
so when this promotion went (65:04 - 65:12)
live uh you could they announced it the (65:08 - 65:14)
day before and they said this exhibit is (65:12 - 65:16)
opening in Amsterdam it's only in (65:14 - 65:20)
Amsterdam and it's opening tomorrow (65:16 - 65:23)
ultimately and starting tomorrow (65:20 - 65:26)
starting tonight you can go on to (65:23 - 65:29)
the m what what is the museum called (65:26 - 65:31)
vano Museum oh it is just the vano (65:29 - 65:33)
museum NL or.com or something like that (65:31 - 65:35)
it's it's like their fifth 50th (65:33 - 65:39)
Anniversary so the Pikachu part of this (65:35 - 65:40)
museum is pretty tiny it's like two (65:39 - 65:42)
floors you can already see one of the (65:40 - 65:44)
floors in the pictures that are are (65:42 - 65:46)
shown and then there is like exhibit (65:44 - 65:48)
stuff for like children to like paint (65:46 - 65:50)
and stuff but they do that anyways when (65:48 - 65:52)
it's not Pokemon they just made it (65:50 - 65:55)
Pokemon themed so they said you can buy (65:52 - 65:56)
tickets tonight it will run until (65:55 - 65:58)
January 7th I believe or January 8th (65:56 - 66:02)
something like that and um you will have (65:58 - 66:04)
to do like this little scavenger hunt (66:02 - 66:05)
and when you get do the scavenger hunt (66:04 - 66:07)
you will get this (66:05 - 66:11)
Pikachu painted like the self-portrait (66:07 - 66:13)
with gray felt hat is what it's it's (66:11 - 66:15)
Vincent Van Go's self-portrait with gray (66:13 - 66:17)
hat so you do the little scavenger hunt (66:15 - 66:19)
you get the card there will be some (66:17 - 66:21)
merchandise at the Museum including the (66:19 - 66:24)
plush a tote bag uh what looks to be (66:21 - 66:26)
like a little statue SL bookend and then (66:24 - 66:28)
some (66:26 - 66:29)
posters (66:28 - 66:32)

sorry think the thing I got Yen and Juan (66:46 - 66:51)
on my brain cuz I'm like see those (66:49 - 66:53)
prices I'm like counting Juan right now (66:51 - 66:55)
cuz I'm about to get on a plight to (66:53 - 66:58)
Korea it's it's ultimately like $24 USD (66:55 - 67:00)
to get a ticket to the (66:58 - 67:04)
museum Shez I'm losing my mind this (67:00 - 67:07)
episode (67:04 - 67:11)
so I so th this this to me was very (67:07 - 67:13)
similar to the fossil experience I went (67:11 - 67:16)
to in Japan I I booked a 3our train ride (67:13 - 67:19)
from Tokyo to the middle of nowhere I (67:16 - 67:21)
climbed a half hour mountain and then I (67:19 - 67:23)
went to a museum and it was cool at the (67:21 - 67:24)
very end of the museum that a bunch of (67:23 - 67:27)
Pok√©mon fossils and then they gave you a (67:24 - 67:29)
little ticket and you could cash in the (67:27 - 67:31)
ticket to then purchase the fossil (67:29 - 67:33)
Pikachu plushy there's a bunch of other (67:31 - 67:35)
fossil merchandise but they were really (67:33 - 67:38)
strict one plushy per person but if they (67:35 - 67:40)
had like fossil Pokemon bandanas you can (67:38 - 67:42)
grab as many as you want whatever um and (67:40 - 67:44)
that gift shop was different than the (67:42 - 67:46)
other gift shop there's a long line of (67:44 - 67:47)
people to get in the gift shop everyone (67:46 - 67:49)
of course we were in Japan so they know (67:47 - 67:52)
they love lines in Japan they absolutely (67:49 - 67:54)
love them favorite pastime in Japan is (67:52 - 67:56)
standing in the line very good at it (67:54 - 68:00)
there um so I would assume this would be (67:56 - 68:02)
the same instance uh I've never been to (68:00 - 68:04)
Amsterdam so I heard of this event I was (68:02 - 68:06)
like man I think this would be cool (68:04 - 68:08)
content also I'm addicted to collecting (68:06 - 68:10)
Pikachu plushes also that card looks (68:08 - 68:13)
tight I like van go I think van go is a (68:10 - 68:14)
really cool artist I don't know about (68:13 - 68:16)
you guys I like van Go's stuff I think (68:14 - 68:19)
it's great never been to Amsterdam and I (68:16 - 68:20)
told my twitch chat cuz I was live at (68:19 - 68:22)

$800 back in e credit I'm going to be (68:53 - 68:57)
flying next year anyways I it's not (68:55 - 69:00)
going to go to waste um so I booked it I (68:57 - 69:02)
literally booked a trip to (69:00 - 69:04)
Amsterdam to go to this Museum I was (69:02 - 69:05)
like I want the Pikachu card I want the (69:04 - 69:07)
Pikachu I think I could make a YouTube (69:05 - 69:09)
video out of this maybe recoup some of (69:07 - 69:11)
the $800 cost I'm telling you right now (69:09 - 69:13)
my YouTube videos do not make $800 (69:11 - 69:16)
that's fine um but I thought it would be (69:13 - 69:18)
a cool experience to go to Amsterdam for (69:16 - 69:21)
like four days I go to bed that night (69:18 - 69:24)
wake up oh sorry before going to bed (69:21 - 69:27)
if you went to Van Go's website the van (69:24 - 69:29)
go Museum website it specifically said (69:27 - 69:32)
on the website the card will only be at (69:29 - 69:36)
this Museum the the select mer (69:32 - 69:38)
merchandise will only be at this Museum (69:36 - 69:40)
some select merchandise will be on Van (69:38 - 69:44)
Go's online Museum shop and then some (69:40 - 69:46)
merchandise will be on pokemoncenter.com (69:44 - 69:49)
their website in the yellow and black (69:46 - 69:51)
text that they use said the only place (69:49 - 69:54)
to get the card here and then Joe who (69:51 - 69:56)
did get invited out to the museum early (69:54 - 69:59)
to preview it said they told him that (69:56 - 70:02)
the card would be on pokemoncenter.com (69:59 - 70:07)
um and that was 100% conflicting with (70:02 - 70:09)
the van Go's actual website who are (70:07 - 70:12)
selling tickets to this event well so I (70:09 - 70:15)
so I then found the press release uh and (70:12 - 70:16)
I read through the press release and the (70:15 - 70:18)
press release also said card will be (70:16 - 70:21)
available on pokemon.com with a purchase (70:18 - 70:25)
of a van go item and it said any Van Go (70:21 - 70:28)
item and then Pokemon Center that night (70:25 - 70:30)
pokemoncenter.com that night updated (70:28 - 70:33)
with a van go Banner saying coming soon (70:30 - 70:35)
that was not (70:33 - 70:37)
clickable and I woke up the next so I (70:35 - 70:39)
was like okay well that kind of sucks (70:37 - 70:41)
maybe I don't want to go to Amsterdam (70:39 - 70:42)
because if I can just get the card in (70:41 - 70:44)
the Pikachu plus off Pokemon Center I (70:42 - 70:46)
you know Joe I did talk to Joe that that (70:44 - 70:48)
morning and Joe was like you know it is (70:46 - 70:51)
really tiny but you know he also said (70:48 - 70:53)
that's a good price $800 maybe you (70:51 - 70:56)
should keep it (70:53 - 70:56)
so so I go to bed I wake up (70:56 - 71:03)
and it it was almost like they burned (71:00 - 71:05)
down the museum it was it was like the (71:03 - 71:06)
worst news in the entire world it was (71:05 - 71:09)
people pushing each other Tik Tock (71:06 - 71:13)
videos of of people just grabbing like I (71:09 - 71:15)
don't know how else to describe it it (71:13 - 71:17)
was how else do you paint that this (71:15 - 71:21)
whole first day of the event was a (71:17 - 71:24)
nightmare situation it was like Black (71:21 - 71:27)
Friday in a museum exactly like just (71:24 - 71:28)
think about those videos you've seen (71:27 - 71:31)
where like the extreme videos of the of (71:28 - 71:33)
the day after Thanksgiving shopping (71:31 - 71:37)
stuff it was that in a museum which is (71:33 - 71:39)
just and it was it was pictures of (71:37 - 71:42)
people getting 30 of these cards it was (71:39 - 71:45)
articles about eBay prices already going (71:42 - 71:47)
up it (71:45 - 71:49)
was it was that people weren't even (71:47 - 71:51)
doing the scavenger hunt people were (71:49 - 71:53)
grabbing like the they they had to shut (71:51 - 71:55)
it down (71:53 - 71:56)
and so there's like a couple things (71:55 - 71:59)
going through my mind number (71:56 - 72:03)
one how were they not prepared for this (71:59 - 72:06)
how was there not maybe like museums (72:03 - 72:08)
have security guards if there's any (72:06 - 72:10)
place in the world that has security (72:08 - 72:14)
guards it's a museum and the van go (72:10 - 72:17)
Museum and I know some museums security (72:14 - 72:20)
guards are like 400 years old I (72:17 - 72:22)
understand that that's like a (72:20 - 72:25)
reality (72:22 - 72:25)
but even even in like a Black Friday (72:26 - 72:31)
situation which we've all seen videos of (72:28 - 72:32)
Black Friday that's a really good (72:31 - 72:33)
analogy by the way we' all seen videos (72:32 - 72:34)
of Black Friday of people pushing for (72:33 - 72:37)
like Tickle Me Elmo or Furby or whatever (72:34 - 72:40)
like there is still a controlled there (72:37 - 72:43)
are still some stores not every store in (72:40 - 72:45)
the entire world had those instances of (72:43 - 72:47)
Black Friday right it's not every Best (72:45 - 72:49)
Buy it's not every Target you you still (72:47 - 72:52)
have stores that are like everyone get (72:49 - 72:54)
in a line no one's moving moving forward (72:52 - 72:56)
until we get a line here we're letting (72:54 - 72:57)
three people in the store we're waiting (72:56 - 72:58)
until three people get out we're letting (72:57 - 73:00)
three more people in the store very like (72:58 - 73:03)
orderly fashion right we have enough (73:00 - 73:08)
cards for everyone just get in a line (73:03 - 73:11)
and and I do partially blame the museum (73:08 - 73:13)
for not having some sort of (73:11 - 73:17)
control of like security guards (73:13 - 73:19)
obviously I blame all the people pushing (73:17 - 73:21)
cuz that's gross and outrageous but then (73:19 - 73:24)
I also blame the Pokemon company for (73:21 - 73:27)
there is no way that they've done this (73:24 - 73:29)
so many times again I don't know if it's (73:27 - 73:32)
Japan offices or UK offices or or or or (73:29 - 73:35)
the American offices but anytime they (73:32 - 73:39)
attach a card to something this happens (73:35 - 73:42)
mhm like if they were just like no cards (73:39 - 73:44)
just (73:42 - 73:44)
plushies this wouldn't have happened (73:44 - 73:48)
it's specifically the cards that like (73:46 - 73:50)
Drive these (73:48 - 73:53)
scalpers um or just resellers in general (73:50 - 73:54)
it is (73:53 - 73:56)
but I think for okay for one I really (73:54 - 73:58)
wouldn't I can't really put a whole lot (73:56 - 74:00)
of blame on the museum because I (73:58 - 74:02)
guarantee you in the 50 years that the (74:00 - 74:04)
van go museum has been open there's (74:02 - 74:07)
never been anything to drive this many (74:04 - 74:10)
people at one time to a gift shop to do (74:07 - 74:13)
what happened when your work is 180 (74:10 - 74:16)
years old the Pokemon for not (74:13 - 74:17)
communicating to them that this could (74:16 - 74:19)
happen and yeah you're right more (74:17 - 74:22)
Pokemon blame yes I mean the items in (74:19 - 74:24)
that museum are worth so much more than (74:22 - 74:27)
anything in that gift shop right like it (74:24 - 74:30)
like and so part of me also (74:27 - 74:33)
wonders how long that actually went on (74:30 - 74:34)
right we saw the clips we saw the videos (74:33 - 74:36)
but like did it go on for 5 minutes and (74:34 - 74:38)
then it was kind of cleared up because (74:36 - 74:39)
they were like oh this is actually is (74:38 - 74:41)
not how we want this to go and they did (74:39 - 74:44)
shut it down quickly where was that gift (74:41 - 74:46)
shop in relation to like the rest of the (74:44 - 74:49)
museum like you said with the uh fossil (74:46 - 74:52)
Museum like it was a separate gift shop (74:49 - 74:54)
from like the Museum's regular gift shop (74:52 - 74:55)
right you said it was actually separate (74:54 - 74:58)
so where was this in relation to (74:55 - 74:59)
anything else it wasn't their main gift (74:58 - 75:01)
shop they have now moved the Pokemon (74:59 - 75:03)
gift shop to another location in the (75:01 - 75:06)
museum yeah I mean that makes sense but (75:03 - 75:11)
I mean so again like I I I can't even (75:06 - 75:13)
begin to really blame the museum but the (75:11 - 75:16)
Pokemon company for sure I mean most of (75:13 - 75:19)
all the people that right (75:16 - 75:22)
right I wanted physically throw up (75:19 - 75:25)
watching these videos it was it was so (75:22 - 75:28)
awful and I feel so bad for families or (75:25 - 75:31)
the museum employees or just everyone (75:28 - 75:33)
involved except for the like it just the (75:31 - 75:35)
the people that are like money money (75:33 - 75:36)
money money money I'm only here because (75:35 - 75:40)
I I this is this is my job is to buy (75:36 - 75:41)
this get this free item and then sell it (75:40 - 75:45)
for $400 yeah but also I I've seen a lot (75:41 - 75:47)
of people saying you know the Pokemon (75:45 - 75:50)
Community again and no it's not the (75:47 - 75:51)
Pokemon Community not the Pokemon (75:50 - 75:53)
Community but it's not even it's not (75:51 - 75:56)
even that this is not like just the (75:53 - 76:00)
Pokemon Community like again look at the (75:56 - 76:02)
day after Thanksgiving videos like it's (76:00 - 76:04)
not the same thing but it's the same (76:02 - 76:06)
actions like it is people in general (76:04 - 76:08)
there are people who will act this way (76:06 - 76:10)
and that's a problem and we need to be (76:08 - 76:13)
better than that as a people in general (76:10 - 76:15)
not like as just a Pokemon Community or (76:13 - 76:18)
whatever that said it's also a scalping (76:15 - 76:20)
thing and that is the thing that comes (76:18 - 76:24)
with this hobby with this topic this (76:20 - 76:26)
along with any other cardle anything (76:24 - 76:29)
that really you can collect on and you (76:26 - 76:31)
know it does come with that (76:29 - 76:34)
but it's not I just don't it's not (76:31 - 76:36)
Pokemon Community specific like I don't (76:34 - 76:38)
even know how many people are Pokemon (76:36 - 76:40)
fans it's like not Pokemon fan or (76:38 - 76:43)
Pokemon Community issue this is this is (76:40 - 76:44)
a scalping issue we saw this with (76:43 - 76:48)
amiibos we we saw this with baseball (76:44 - 76:50)
cards baseball cards are still in a (76:48 - 76:51)
terrible position right now like they (76:50 - 76:54)
are still like way worse than Pokemon (76:51 - 76:55)
card like Pokemon cards like what we (76:54 - 76:56)
said with the Charizard collection box (76:55 - 76:59)
earlier in the show like it did die down (76:56 - 77:03)
it's not like it's never going to be (76:59 - 77:04)
solved there will still be products that (77:03 - 77:07)
will be more sought after than others (77:04 - 77:09)
yeah um absolutely I mean we're seeing (77:07 - 77:10)
that right now actually with the 151 (77:09 - 77:12)
can't get it anywhere right now it's (77:10 - 77:13)
finally the first time where this has (77:12 - 77:16)
happened uh probably bad timing for the (77:13 - 77:18)
release of this card at the same where (77:16 - 77:20)
things are you know big what what' you (77:18 - 77:23)
say 151 is not fully released yet like (77:20 - 77:25)
there some boxes that come out next week (77:23 - 77:27)
October 6th yeah but I mean a big chunk (77:25 - 77:30)
of like you know stuff has been released (77:27 - 77:32)
and is unavailable everywhere but (77:30 - 77:35)
anyways um so second to the people being (77:32 - 77:37)
you know like shouldn't act that way (77:35 - 77:41)
yeah the Pokemon company can control (77:37 - 77:43)
certain aspects of this you know be it (77:41 - 77:45)
like how they release it the (77:43 - 77:48)
communication around you know what (77:45 - 77:49)
they're saying and everything especially (77:48 - 77:52)
with what you were saying Steve with uh (77:49 - 77:55)
the van go Museum having information (77:52 - 77:58)
about so there was a point in the day (77:55 - 78:00)
when people figured out that the Pokemon (77:58 - 78:03)
Center would also have the Pikachu card (78:00 - 78:05)
but the wording around what was said (78:03 - 78:08)
earlier then made it seem like oh it (78:05 - 78:11)
sounds like maybe there's a different (78:08 - 78:13)
set of cards at the museum that are (78:11 - 78:15)
going to be exclusive to that and it (78:13 - 78:17)
wasn't like you said it wasn't until (78:15 - 78:19)
saraby where he posted a thing saying (78:17 - 78:22)
hey no it's exactly the same card when (78:19 - 78:23)
that was the first time people got a (78:22 - 78:26)
realization that it's the same card that (78:23 - 78:29)
online as it is at the Museum and this (78:26 - 78:34)
is coming next week and very (78:29 - 78:37)
important yeah so no communication from (78:34 - 78:40)
the Pokemon company on really how any of (78:37 - 78:43)
it was going to work um well this goes (78:40 - 78:45)
back to the dcui thing too how does the (78:43 - 78:49)
museum have a very detailed F FAQ page (78:45 - 78:51)
mhm specifically about this Pok√©mon (78:49 - 78:54)
event that they start selling tickets (78:51 - 78:57)
for that night I cuz I bought my tickets (78:54 - 78:59)
that night mhm and then how does the (78:57 - 79:01)
Pokemon company put out its own press (78:59 - 79:04)
release that goes out to IGN SB I get (79:01 - 79:07)
the press release and it say it's it's (79:04 - 79:09)
complete opposites there will only be (79:07 - 79:11)
cards here there will be cards with the (79:09 - 79:13)
Pokemon Center (79:11 - 79:15)
purchase like there are communication (79:13 - 79:19)
issues yeah that's just they're saying (79:15 - 79:21)
different things to different people mhm (79:19 - 79:26)
so the cards go on eBay and on (79:21 - 79:30)
average I I I I do like roll my eyes at (79:26 - 79:33)
Tik Tock reporting news outlets or or (79:30 - 79:36)
like not I'm going to say Nintendo life (79:33 - 79:37)
but not Nintendo life but like sites (79:36 - 79:39)
like Nintendo life that they're like (79:37 - 79:42)
these cards are selling for $700 no when (79:39 - 79:45)
it says buy it now that doesn't mean (79:42 - 79:47)
that it actually sold that's what they (79:45 - 79:50)
want I we the chariz the the the (79:47 - 79:52)
Gyarados gold skateboard was still (79:50 - 79:55)
$88,000 buy it now it never sold it's (79:52 - 79:58)
been three weeks now no one paid $8,000 (79:55 - 80:00)
for gold Gyarados I'm sorry Gyarados (79:58 - 80:03)
Charizard did sell more than you um we (80:00 - 80:08)
did see listings sell there are websites (80:03 - 80:09)
you can go to that are not eBay that (80:08 - 80:11)
scans eBay and shows you what the Final (80:09 - 80:13)
prices were the average price was (80:11 - 80:16)
between $200 to $400 a lot of$ 250 a lot (80:13 - 80:19)
of 300 there were only two cards I saw (80:16 - 80:21)
that day after about 12 hours that sold (80:19 - 80:24)
for $800 each I don't think those were (80:21 - 80:28)
genuine buyers I think what will happen (80:24 - 80:29)
this is another thing about eBay that (80:28 - 80:30)
maybe you don't know if you don't know (80:29 - 80:32)
eBay and you only just see somebody say (80:30 - 80:33)
like they're going for $800 on eBay and (80:32 - 80:36)
you're like that's crazy is that when a (80:33 - 80:38)
new product comes out like this and (80:36 - 80:39)
there's no (80:38 - 80:42)
actual like what is this going to be (80:39 - 80:43)
ended what what is the price of this (80:42 - 80:45)
like if they announce a new Charizard (80:43 - 80:47)
for three months ago in three months in (80:45 - 80:49)
the future you're like how where's this (80:47 - 80:50)
Charizard going to fall is this a $100 (80:49 - 80:52)
Charizard is this a $800 Charizard is (80:50 - 80:54)
this a $500 Charizard what you will do (80:52 - 80:56)
is you will (80:54 - 80:59)
have people bid on each other's stuff to (80:56 - 81:01)
artificially Drive the price up so when (80:59 - 81:04)
you do look and you go oh this one sold (81:01 - 81:07)
for 700 so I must be getting 400 for a (81:04 - 81:10)
deal but maybe I'm willing to buy 500 (81:07 - 81:12)
because it's still under 700 they are (81:10 - 81:15)
inflating the eBay Market to make it (81:12 - 81:17)
look like these cards should be at the (81:15 - 81:20)
$700 $800 price range but in reality no (81:17 - 81:22)
one was actually buying it at that price (81:20 - 81:24)
sure just set the bar as high as they (81:22 - 81:28)
can right yes yes so when you see two (81:24 - 81:32)
sell for 700 but then you see 20 not (81:28 - 81:33)
even break (81:32 - 81:37)
400 something's off mhm (81:33 - 81:41)
um and so day one of the museum a bunch (81:37 - 81:44)
of these cards go on eBay some of them (81:41 - 81:47)
are selling for up to 400 but mostly (81:44 - 81:48)
like (81:47 - 81:52)
300ish um and then day two of the museum (81:48 - 81:54)
everything is most mostly back to normal (81:52 - 81:56)
now they said that they moved the gift (81:54 - 81:57)
shop you're not getting the card with (81:56 - 81:59)
the scavenger hunt anymore you are (81:57 - 82:01)
getting the card when you leave the (81:59 - 82:03)
museum when you go out the door they (82:01 - 82:06)
will hand you your one card the gift (82:03 - 82:08)
shop now is you can only buy one of each (82:06 - 82:11)
item in the gift shop and from the (82:08 - 82:13)
communication I read this is me with my (82:11 - 82:15)
fingers crossed not canceling my (82:13 - 82:18)
Amsterdam ticket that you should be able (82:15 - 82:20)
to go you should be able to enjoy the (82:18 - 82:22)
museum as of this podcast it's been 2 (82:20 - 82:24)
days since that ENT so everything seems (82:22 - 82:26)
normal you should be able to go into the (82:24 - 82:28)
gift shop buy one poster buy one plush (82:26 - 82:30)
get your card on the way out it should (82:28 - 82:34)
be fine which is perfect that's what it (82:30 - 82:38)
should have been to begin with um and (82:34 - 82:40)
the exhibit's open for three more months (82:38 - 82:44)
yeah yeah they did say in the if I don't (82:40 - 82:45)
know if it was on the van I think it was (82:44 - 82:48)
on the vano website they did say though (82:45 - 82:50)
that the card is only available as long (82:48 - 82:51)
as they're available so like they did (82:50 - 82:54)
not guarantee that if you go in January (82:51 - 82:56)
or December that you would be able to (82:54 - 82:57)
get the promo card cuz they did say (82:56 - 83:00)
those will those will only be available (82:57 - 83:03)
until they're until they're out um which (83:00 - 83:06)
this leads to the second problem which (83:03 - 83:08)
is they said that they were coming soon (83:06 - 83:11)
on Pokemon Center they really stretched (83:08 - 83:13)
the word coming (83:11 - 83:15)
soon because it was coming soon for a (83:13 - 83:16)
long (83:15 - 83:21)
time uh so the the a long time being (83:16 - 83:23)
just a long day (83:21 - 83:25)
right I was G to say it was like 12 it (83:23 - 83:27)
was like 12 hours a long day with much (83:25 - 83:29)
anticipation which turns into a long (83:27 - 83:31)
time it okay because it was two days (83:29 - 83:33)
right like well it was it was it was (83:31 - 83:36)
Wednesday night where the banner went up (83:33 - 83:38)
on Pokemon center.com the vano banner (83:36 - 83:40)
went up on Pokemon center.com and then (83:38 - 83:44)
on Thursday morning I woke up at 10: (83:40 - 83:46)
because usually poke Pokemon things drop (83:44 - 83:49)
at 10:00 nothing dropped I then checked (83:46 - 83:51)
again at 11: nothing dropped nothing (83:49 - 83:53)
happened that all day all day on (83:51 - 83:56)
Thursday and then around 3:00 the banner (83:53 - 84:00)
changed from Van go to Van go coming (83:56 - 84:02)
soon hold on no things did happen on (84:00 - 84:05)
Thursday and it was a mess back door (84:02 - 84:08)
things yeah there was no announcement (84:05 - 84:10)
but there was availability of things on (84:08 - 84:12)
Thursday there was availability that (84:10 - 84:14)
shouldn't happened on Thursday so they (84:12 - 84:16)
were adding stuff to the store I don't (84:14 - 84:18)
know if Pok√©mon Center uses like Shopify (84:16 - 84:20)
or Magento or I don't know what they use (84:18 - 84:22)
on their back end but they were adding (84:20 - 84:24)
product to the store but they were (84:22 - 84:27)
hidden but if you knew the URL you could (84:24 - 84:30)
find it and purchase it and from my (84:27 - 84:31)
understanding those people when they (84:30 - 84:33)
added to the card it was not adding the (84:31 - 84:36)
card so it was two there were two things (84:33 - 84:39)
that happened so it was Thursday morning (84:36 - 84:41)
three of the items did become available (84:39 - 84:44)
the plush and two portraits actually (84:41 - 84:45)
three portraits the sunf Flora portrait (84:44 - 84:48)
also so there were three portraits and (84:45 - 84:50)
the plush were available you could (84:48 - 84:53)
search Van go and see them (84:50 - 84:54)
uh you could also if you had the (84:53 - 84:57)
specific URL to each of those you could (84:54 - 85:00)
get to those pages and you could buy the (84:57 - 85:02)
plush and the portraits the plush sold (85:00 - 85:05)
out very very quickly and people did (85:02 - 85:07)
have a promo card that was attached to (85:05 - 85:09)
those plushes there was no limit or it (85:07 - 85:11)
was a 10 item limit I believe it was a (85:09 - 85:14)
10 item limit yep and people could add (85:11 - 85:15)
those to cart and get the pro the promo (85:14 - 85:19)
card was attached the portraits all of a (85:15 - 85:21)
sudden people started adding the (85:19 - 85:22)
portraits and there was no card attach (85:21 - 85:25)
Ed they started removing the card when (85:22 - 85:27)
they realized I think what was happening (85:25 - 85:29)
and so then people were able to purchase (85:27 - 85:31)
the portraits and did and didn't realize (85:29 - 85:34)
the card wasn't attached and then got (85:31 - 85:35)
their confirmation email and then (85:34 - 85:37)
realized there was no promo card (85:35 - 85:38)
attached and they had bought these (85:37 - 85:39)
portraits and there was no promo card (85:38 - 85:43)
attached and so when that happened then (85:39 - 85:44)
everything went down on the site and the (85:43 - 85:46)
whole site crashed and there was like (85:44 - 85:47)
there was a crash and then there was (85:46 - 85:49)
like the pages were gone and then you (85:47 - 85:52)
couldn't get to any of it anymore and I (85:49 - 85:56)
do believe that there were some reports (85:52 - 86:00)
that some of the plush um uh orders were (85:56 - 86:02)
canceled and then it sounds like there (86:00 - 86:03)
were some of the um portrait orders that (86:02 - 86:05)
didn't have promo cards were also (86:03 - 86:08)
canceled by the Pokemon Center um so (86:05 - 86:10)
there were some reports of orders on (86:08 - 86:12)
Thursday getting canceled but the plush (86:10 - 86:13)
went up first and there were promo cards (86:12 - 86:15)
attached to those and people did get (86:13 - 86:18)
confirmations on those yes now that (86:15 - 86:19)
you're saying that I do remember seeing (86:18 - 86:21)
three items that said unavailable you (86:19 - 86:24)
could do look at them but you can you (86:21 - 86:26)
can do and then Friday is when it (86:24 - 86:28)
actually launched and I believe it (86:26 - 86:30)
launched around 10:00 (86:28 - 86:33)
a.m. I didn't get there till 10:45 (86:30 - 86:37)
almost everything was sold out a lot of (86:33 - 86:40)
things didn't let you add to cart even (86:37 - 86:43)
though it said add to cart I ended up (86:40 - 86:46)
logging in first and then refreshing (86:43 - 86:48)
until it for it asked me if I was a (86:46 - 86:51)
robot I verified I wasn't a robot and (86:48 - 86:53)
then after I verified it it let me add (86:51 - 86:56)
one thing to my cart the card showed up (86:53 - 86:59)
I checked out on checkout I got multiple (86:56 - 87:00)
errors I just kept hitting checkout and (86:59 - 87:03)
then I got it my card got charged and as (87:00 - 87:05)
of recording this I still have not (87:03 - 87:07)
gotten a confirmation email and I still (87:05 - 87:10)
haven't gotten the check your account on (87:07 - 87:12)

plus tax that's okay so I had a similar (87:15 - 87:23)
experience I hopped on the website I was (87:19 - 87:26)
able to get an item I was able to get (87:23 - 87:29)
the card I was able to check out with (87:26 - 87:31)
that item in the card I got the (87:29 - 87:33)
confirmation email and everything from (87:31 - 87:37)
Pokemon Center um maybe 10 minutes later (87:33 - 87:39)

when I went to check out because I was (88:12 - 88:16)
Panic checking out I I put I selected my (88:13 - 88:18)

your order number and everything so I (88:40 - 88:43)
got a confirmation email from Pokemon (88:42 - 88:46)
Center about 10 minutes after um and (88:43 - 88:48)
then the same start things started (88:46 - 88:50)
happening where I was like oh okay I (88:48 - 88:51)
rushed and grabbed one item but there (88:50 - 88:52)
was a couple other things things I want (88:51 - 88:54)
there was like a coffee mug there was a (88:52 - 88:55)
puzzle it was a couple other things I (88:54 - 88:56)
was like oh I'm going to grab these (88:55 - 88:58)
things cool items they're great they're (88:56 - 89:00)
awesome and the same stuff started (88:58 - 89:02)
happening it could add to cart it was (89:00 - 89:05)
showing in stock in the cart and then (89:02 - 89:07)
error messages sorry this isn't working (89:05 - 89:09)
sorry this isn't working you know and (89:07 - 89:11)
then out of stock in stock out of stock (89:09 - 89:13)
in stock and the thing about that is (89:11 - 89:17)
that that was the TCG through like all (89:13 - 89:21)
of 2021 on pokemoncenter.com that's when (89:17 - 89:24)
they implemented system in stock out of (89:21 - 89:26)
stock in stock it was going back and (89:24 - 89:27)
forth you could tell it was like they (89:26 - 89:30)
were releasing things in limited amounts (89:27 - 89:32)
so things would go out of stock and then (89:30 - 89:34)
like an hour later they'd be in stock (89:32 - 89:35)
again for a little bit and then they'd (89:34 - 89:36)
go out of stock and they'd be in stock (89:35 - 89:38)
later that day and that was what was (89:36 - 89:42)
happening with multiple sets during 2021 (89:38 - 89:44)
so when I saw this happening and it was (89:42 - 89:47)
two items per person or it was two not (89:44 - 89:49)
two items per person sorry it was two of (89:47 - 89:51)
each item that you could purchase at (89:49 - 89:53)
most right so yeah they changed it from (89:51 - 89:55)
two puzzles two posters two portraits (89:53 - 89:59)
two plushes whatever it was two um but (89:55 - 90:02)
the other problem was that it wasn't one (89:59 - 90:05)
promo card per purchase it was one promo (90:02 - 90:09)
card per item so if you never done (90:05 - 90:11)
before yeah they've never done that (90:09 - 90:13)
before they have done they have there's (90:11 - 90:15)
there's two promo cards in particular (90:13 - 90:20)
one is delivery Charizard mhm which um (90:15 - 90:21)
you it doesn't matter how much you (90:20 - 90:24)
bought you only one yeah so ideally if (90:21 - 90:27)
you wanted two you would buy $30 or (90:24 - 90:29)
whatever and then check out and then go (90:27 - 90:30)
back in and buy another $30 and check (90:29 - 90:33)
out that was done differently though (90:30 - 90:35)
that was done with a promo code that you (90:33 - 90:37)
had to win essentially earlier to do (90:35 - 90:39)
that which is going to end up I think (90:37 - 90:40)
spoiler alert I think that's going to (90:39 - 90:42)
happen with this at some point and then (90:40 - 90:44)
and then another one was the delivery B (90:42 - 90:47)
doof the Charizard one is interesting (90:44 - 90:49)
because when the delivery Charizard came (90:47 - 90:51)
out on Pokemon Center I'm pretty sure (90:49 - 90:53)
there was two releases and Bobby's (90:51 - 90:54)
talking about the second release the (90:53 - 90:56)
first release you could just add (90:54 - 90:58)
anything to your cart and you would get (90:56 - 91:02)
it cuz that's how I got it I didn't and (90:58 - 91:04)
and so CU I have two delivery Charizards (91:02 - 91:06)
and then they apologize to people right (91:04 - 91:09)
you're right because because I like (91:06 - 91:12)
there was It was supposed to be an email (91:09 - 91:13)
and you were supposed to get the Pokemon (91:12 - 91:14)
Center email that it was available but (91:13 - 91:16)
it came out too early and then it was (91:14 - 91:18)
sold out so like barely anyone got it I (91:16 - 91:20)
just happened to be awake when it showed (91:18 - 91:22)
up I think I bought like cards or (91:20 - 91:24)
something and then it came with it that (91:22 - 91:27)
card originally was $400 to like $600 on (91:24 - 91:29)
eBay the cuz it's Charizard it's (91:27 - 91:31)
delivery Charizard it was like a a 1H (91:29 - 91:34)
hour window and then they sent then they (91:31 - 91:36)
handpicked people or randomized people (91:34 - 91:38)
and then sent them an invite you had to (91:36 - 91:40)
spend $25 enter the code in your email (91:38 - 91:42)
and then it would add delivery Charizard (91:40 - 91:44)
to your card as of this recording (91:42 - 91:47)
delivery Charizard is a $30 card cuz (91:44 - 91:49)
they did it twice yep they printed that (91:47 - 91:52)
card to the moon and then the delivery (91:49 - 91:55)
bedf was like Charizard you had to be (91:52 - 91:57)
like handpicked or like randomized (91:55 - 91:59)
picked in your email you copied it you (91:57 - 92:02)
checked out that card the delivery B (91:59 - 92:04)
doof is about (92:02 - 92:08)
$200 because it they didn't they they (92:04 - 92:11)
printed a lot but it was still Limited (92:08 - 92:13)
in a sense of like you had to win a (92:11 - 92:15)
lottery and it has a Charizard on and it (92:13 - 92:17)
has a Char it's beo fan Charizard come (92:15 - 92:19)
on it's two good Pokemon instead of one (92:17 - 92:21)
good Pokemon so I think this is (92:19 - 92:24)
happening going I think so they they the (92:21 - 92:26)
van Go stuff went up it was a nightmare (92:24 - 92:28)
for whatever reason multiple cards were (92:26 - 92:30)
being added to cart I that that (92:28 - 92:32)
shouldn't have happened even though that (92:30 - 92:34)
was in the wording of being like with (92:32 - 92:36)
every purchase you'll get a card but it (92:34 - 92:39)
only went up to five so people who added (92:36 - 92:42)
eight items only got a Max of five cards (92:39 - 92:46)
cuz yeah which is like yeah that sounds (92:42 - 92:48)
like a mistake somewhere this whole (92:46 - 92:50)
thing has just been non-stop (92:48 - 92:52)
communication mistes because there was (92:50 - 92:56)
wording around um each item gets a promo (92:52 - 92:58)
card there was wording like that does (92:56 - 93:00)
still sound like a miscommunication to (92:58 - 93:03)
me yeah yeah yeah the fact that they (93:00 - 93:06)
said it and it was happening any van go (93:03 - 93:09)
item gets you one pro like each item in (93:06 - 93:12)
the store qualifies for one promo card (93:09 - 93:13)
so it doesn't matter if you get a (93:12 - 93:16)
notebook a pencil a portrait you will (93:13 - 93:20)
get the promo card yeah um that's (93:16 - 93:23)
probably how it should have been worded (93:20 - 93:25)
uh but I think now so they they actually (93:23 - 93:28)
apologized on Twitter and Instagram and (93:25 - 93:30)
all that saying we're going to (93:28 - 93:33)
re-release the van Go stuff soon so if (93:30 - 93:34)
you're listening to this podcast you (93:33 - 93:35)
want the van Go stuff do not purchase (93:34 - 93:38)
from scalpers no uh they're going to (93:35 - 93:39)
re-release it (93:38 - 93:42)
again they're going to I if the one (93:39 - 93:44)
thing you want is the plush I promise (93:42 - 93:45)
you that is probably the thing they (93:44 - 93:46)
print to the Moon they're very good at (93:45 - 93:49)
making plushes they love plushes it's (93:46 - 93:51)
like 60% of this B this company's income (93:49 - 93:53)
they will I'm I don't know about the (93:51 - 93:55)
portraits you know I don't know about (93:53 - 93:56)
the deck boxes but they will definitely (93:55 - 93:59)
print the plushes to the Moon um and I (93:56 - 94:01)
bet they're going to randomize and send (93:59 - 94:04)
out codes to people where if you get the (94:01 - 94:06)
code in your email you you add the plush (94:04 - 94:09)
to cart you enter the code you get I (94:06 - 94:10)
this is that this the only way they can (94:09 - 94:12)
do these things and again this goes back (94:10 - 94:15)
to the start of this conversation how (94:12 - 94:18)
did anyone planned this van go Museum (94:15 - 94:21)
thing and not think a Black Friday (94:18 - 94:25)
incident was going to happen yeah so (94:21 - 94:28)
there is a little uh extra to the to the (94:25 - 94:30)
email or the the apology that they oh (94:28 - 94:33)
and I you have the link here um does (94:30 - 94:35)
specifically say that they want to (94:33 - 94:37)
provide more ways to get the promo card (94:35 - 94:39)
to people as well (94:37 - 94:43)
so that to me says exactly what you said (94:39 - 94:46)
randomize with uh promo code you go and (94:43 - 94:49)
you're able to buy something with that (94:46 - 94:51)
promo code you get the card added to it (94:49 - 94:53)
they'll probably I would imagine there's (94:51 - 94:56)
going to be a lot more of these cards (94:53 - 94:58)
than uh the people selling them now (94:56 - 95:00)
would like well people selling them now (94:58 - 95:01)
are trying to get them out as quick as (95:00 - 95:03)
possible because they know there are (95:01 - 95:05)
going to be so many more of these cards (95:03 - 95:08)
being printed and so as of this (95:05 - 95:10)

$80 um it is only going to go down in (95:26 - 95:32)
price I better put mine up on eBay (95:29 - 95:34)
now not doing that don't do that don't (95:32 - 95:37)
be that person um um yeah like Buy It (95:34 - 95:40)
Now 1119 Buy It Now 129 I mean eBay is a (95:37 - 95:42)
lot of undercutting right like oh you (95:40 - 95:44)
put yours at 119 I'm going to put mine (95:42 - 95:45)
at 115 and mine's going to sell before (95:44 - 95:47)
your Sals because they want because they (95:45 - 95:48)
know especially because they know where (95:47 - 95:50)
it's going where that price is going (95:48 - 95:52)
because this card once everyone had even (95:50 - 95:55)
the people who just ordered who just got (95:52 - 95:57)
through because Pokemon company did (95:55 - 95:59)
specifically say that all the items were (95:57 - 96:02)
sold out so I mean whether that it was (95:59 - 96:04)
real or they just actually like took (96:02 - 96:05)
action to take everything down because (96:04 - 96:08)
it was such a mess of a release they did (96:05 - 96:10)
say in that tweet we sold out of (96:08 - 96:12)
everything like we already sold out of (96:10 - 96:14)
everything which is so sad because they (96:12 - 96:16)
never announced that it was actually up (96:14 - 96:18)
yeah like there was never actually an (96:16 - 96:19)
email that went out nothing went out to (96:18 - 96:22)
say hey this is available now everything (96:19 - 96:25)
was sold out before they could even (96:22 - 96:27)
announce that anything was available to (96:25 - 96:30)
purchase now I will say to your point (96:27 - 96:34)
Steve um if you do want a portrait if (96:30 - 96:36)
you still because I do I want Bobby in (96:34 - 96:38)
his back alley has four of them $400 (96:36 - 96:41)
each if you do want a portrait come on (96:38 - 96:43)
go to my eBay store and no no no if you (96:41 - 96:46)
do want a portrait it it is more (96:43 - 96:47)
expensive than on the Pokemon Center (96:46 - 96:49)
because on the Pokemon Center they had (96:47 - 96:52)
Pikachu and Eevee with the felt hat for (96:49 - 96:54)
$50 for like a canvas portrait think it (96:52 - 96:58)
was 16 by 20 inches y uh you can go to (96:54 - 97:01)
the van go Museum website they actually (96:58 - 97:05)
do print to order on the six pieces that (97:01 - 97:08)
are the six pieces of artwork you can (97:05 - 97:11)
get them ordered on paper Canvas OR and (97:08 - 97:12)
I don't know if I'm pronouncing this (97:11 - 97:14)
work right because I've only ever read (97:12 - 97:16)
it but dibond dbond it's like the (97:14 - 97:18)
aluminum like the aluminum stuff I know (97:16 - 97:19)
what you're talking about I don't know (97:18 - 97:22)
how to say it you can get it printed (97:19 - 97:23)
those three different ways again it's (97:22 - 97:25)
more expensive they do have prices in (97:23 - 97:28)
Euros also in dollars and I did price (97:25 - 97:30)
out um the smeargle one cuz the smeargle (97:28 - 97:33)
one wasn't even on Pokemon Center as a (97:30 - 97:35)
canvas piece but I priced out like the (97:33 - 97:38)
smeargle one like a medium size which I (97:35 - 97:41)
think was somewhere like 20 to 20 x 24 (97:38 - 97:42)
Ines it's all in centimeters because (97:41 - 97:46)
it's European but um was (97:42 - 97:49)
like20 for like the canvas and then it (97:46 - 97:51)
was like $30 for shipping cuz it's (97:49 - 97:53)
coming from I'm assuming because it's (97:51 - 97:56)
com from Amsterdam um but the paper ones (97:53 - 98:00)
you can get the paper ones for like 40 (97:56 - 98:02)
for a print on paper from the museum so (98:00 - 98:04)
anyways and it's print to order so who (98:02 - 98:05)
knows how long they'll be around but (98:04 - 98:07)
they shouldn't sell out because it's (98:05 - 98:09)
print to order yeah it's to order if you (98:07 - 98:11)
uh go to the website go to the web store (98:09 - 98:14)
at the van go Museum there's a Pokemon (98:11 - 98:16)
section and everything else there is (98:14 - 98:17)
like sold out like they do have other (98:16 - 98:19)
things you can buy but it's all sold out (98:17 - 98:22)
except for those prints so (98:19 - 98:23)
definitely do that if you want um (98:22 - 98:25)
especially if you don't want the Pikachu (98:23 - 98:27)
or Eevee they've got the other there's (98:25 - 98:30)
like four other um pieces of art that (98:27 - 98:32)
they have that you can order as well (98:30 - 98:34)
they have a really cool Corvin knite one (98:32 - 98:36)
and I have seen people appreciating the (98:34 - 98:39)
Snorlax and the sun Flora was expected (98:36 - 98:41)
and is wonderful yeah so they're great (98:39 - 98:43)
the pieces are great and they're done (98:41 - 98:45)
and the thing it's cool is that the (98:43 - 98:48)
pieces are done by I don't know about (98:45 - 98:49)
all of them but specifically like the (98:48 - 98:52)
smeargle one is done by to kazuk Kia who (98:49 - 98:55)
is a who's a TCG artist and obviously he (98:52 - 98:57)
does a lot of other stuff but um I think (98:55 - 99:00)
the Pikachu you're saying van go didn't (98:57 - 99:03)
do these Pokemon p no surprisingly they (99:00 - 99:06)
couldn't get van go to do the (99:03 - 99:08)
Pokemon yeah it just wasn't available (99:06 - 99:11)
for some reason um but uh no but it's (99:08 - 99:13)
cool like the fact that it's like TCG (99:11 - 99:15)
artists um or at least for that one the (99:13 - 99:18)
Pikachu one was by uh I believe Soo who (99:15 - 99:22)
does so good so yeah like I don't care (99:18 - 99:25)
if this card is 99 Cents no it's great I (99:22 - 99:27)
think it's a fantastic looking card it's (99:25 - 99:29)
amazing and I think what happened too is (99:27 - 99:32)
a lot of people who were collecting and (99:29 - 99:34)
do remember like the Munch cards the (99:32 - 99:38)
scream cards right pach those super you (99:34 - 99:40)
know mimikyu um they have that they had (99:38 - 99:42)
that kind of like feeling when they saw (99:40 - 99:45)
the Pikachu the van go one because it (99:42 - 99:46)
just kind of called back (99:45 - 99:49)
to you know just that collaboration (99:46 - 99:52)
which is cool I mean any any Pokemon (99:49 - 99:54)
collaboration that does some sort of art (99:52 - 99:57)
that's not just slapping a Pokemon on a (99:54 - 99:59)
shirt is really cool these are (99:57 - 100:01)
wonderfully stylized and I'm really (99:59 - 100:03)
curious what would have happened if they (100:01 - 100:06)
hadn't been tied to a TCG card I feel (100:03 - 100:09)
like they still would have sold out yeah (100:06 - 100:12)
very quickly this is a good collection (100:09 - 100:14)
yeah yeah I I I think there there have (100:12 - 100:15)
been definitely collections in the past (100:14 - 100:19)
that sell out relatively quick um I (100:15 - 100:22)
think the TC anytime a cool TCG card is (100:19 - 100:24)
added to it that obviously increases the (100:22 - 100:27)
eyes of people who want to resell for (100:24 - 100:30)
sure you know like you could resell some (100:27 - 100:33)
plushes but the reselling plushes isn't (100:30 - 100:36)
nearly as efficient as cards one is very (100:33 - 100:38)
big much bigger than the other uh it (100:36 - 100:39)
takes up more space and cost more to (100:38 - 100:43)
ship so like cards are a very (100:39 - 100:47)
easy like high profit uh turnaround (100:43 - 100:49)
thing because you put them in padded (100:47 - 100:51)
envelopes or or or top loaders and stuff (100:49 - 100:55)
versus you know boxes and and packing uh (100:51 - 100:57)
stuff and for collectors high demand but (100:55 - 101:00)
there was also a Pokemon sleep (100:57 - 101:03)
collaboration recently also came out (101:00 - 101:05)
around the same day that was with some (101:03 - 101:08)
Japanese luxury loungewear brand and (101:05 - 101:11)
that also pretty much immediately sold (101:08 - 101:14)
out it was a good collab I mean the even (101:11 - 101:16)
the skateboards we talked about was a (101:14 - 101:19)
cool collab um it wasn't the coolest (101:16 - 101:22)
collab but it was still uh a cool collab (101:19 - 101:23)
and I think it was priced really well I (101:22 - 101:27)
think $109 for $109 for a deck is is a (101:23 - 101:30)
good price um I think Pokemon has a lot (101:27 - 101:34)
to prove with what went wrong because (101:30 - 101:37)
they're still in my eyes responsible for (101:34 - 101:40)
a lot of this yeah and if it sounds like (101:37 - 101:43)
the museum thing is under control now so (101:40 - 101:45)
hopefully next time we report back on (101:43 - 101:48)
this we can be like yep it's good and (101:45 - 101:51)
clear to go to the museum get your card (101:48 - 101:54)
look at the stuff do your activities (101:51 - 101:55)
I've been told that the van go museum is (101:54 - 101:57)
one of the best museums in the in the (101:55 - 102:01)
world to go to I wouldn't be surprised (101:57 - 102:03)
there was a popup and I know it's gone (102:01 - 102:04)
around different places but there was (102:03 - 102:07)
like a pop-up Bango exhibit in San Diego (102:04 - 102:09)
last year that we went been going around (102:07 - 102:12)
everywhere the light show highly (102:09 - 102:15)
advertised light show and then the all (102:12 - 102:17)
stuff but just seeing like just just (102:15 - 102:20)
seeing some like you know it's it's cool (102:17 - 102:22)
he I think I also really like van go I (102:20 - 102:25)
think the artwork is very cool um I (102:22 - 102:27)
think I think you would have a good (102:25 - 102:29)
experience going to the van go Museum I (102:27 - 102:32)
think it's very highly regarded um so (102:29 - 102:33)
and then you get and then you get that (102:32 - 102:34)
Pokemon collaboration on top of it which (102:33 - 102:37)
is very cool yeah so I mean like if the (102:34 - 102:39)
museum thing is sorted out and settled (102:37 - 102:41)
that's awesome it sounds like more merch (102:39 - 102:43)
should be coming to that sounds like (102:41 - 102:45)
people should be getting their card on (102:43 - 102:48)
the way out um the card is way cheaper (102:45 - 102:50)
on eBay now I have heard that the (102:48 - 102:52)
scalpers move to the outside of the (102:50 - 102:54)
museum and they will offer you cash if (102:52 - 102:57)
you walk out with the card which that's (102:54 - 102:59)
fine like that's (102:57 - 103:02)
a I will take that any day (102:59 - 103:06)
over like them pushing for it yeah (103:02 - 103:08)
totally absolutely there are probably (103:06 - 103:10)
some people walking out of the museum (103:08 - 103:12)
with no interest in a Pikachu card so (103:10 - 103:13)
and if someone hands them like if (103:12 - 103:15)
someone like I'll give you 10 bucks 20 (103:13 - 103:16)
bucks for that they're like yeah sure (103:15 - 103:18)
yeah sure whatever I just got my free I (103:16 - 103:20)
just got a free ticket basically to the (103:18 - 103:21)
museum right like I just paid for my (103:20 - 103:27)
museum trip um so uh yeah I but I think (103:21 - 103:29)
they I think they still have a lot to (103:27 - 103:33)
prove with this Pokemon Center eventual (103:29 - 103:36)
reprint whatever that is are are they (103:33 - 103:38)
sticking to their word is are they going (103:36 - 103:40)
to print a bunch of these are they going (103:38 - 103:42)
to produce a bunch of these plushes a (103:40 - 103:43)
bunch of these prints some of these (103:42 - 103:48)
cards for more people to get um and like (103:43 - 103:50)
scarlet and violet like everything else (103:48 - 103:52)
we've been been talking about are they (103:50 - 103:54)
going to learn for this learn from this (103:52 - 103:57)
for future collaborations because I (103:54 - 103:59)
can't imagine this is going to be the (103:57 - 104:02)
last like they did the scream stuff for (103:59 - 104:04)
the Munich things they did the fossil (104:02 - 104:05)
things that was actually only supposed (104:04 - 104:08)
to last for a year but then Co happened (104:05 - 104:09)
but then it was wildly successful so (104:08 - 104:11)
they keep moving the fossil things from (104:09 - 104:13)
Museum to Museum and it still has like (104:11 - 104:15)
another 6 months who knows if that's (104:13 - 104:18)
going to get extended um the whole (104:15 - 104:20)
reason the Pokey Lids in Japan are not (104:18 - 104:25)
in big cities like Tokyo or Osaka or um (104:20 - 104:28)
uh Kyoto is because they purposely want (104:25 - 104:30)
and they knew that it would draw tourism (104:28 - 104:34)
so they put them in non-pop areas to (104:30 - 104:36)
prevent things like this there is (104:34 - 104:38)
somebody at this company that thought (104:36 - 104:41)
very very well very thoughtful about the (104:38 - 104:43)
Pokey liid situation in Japan and they (104:41 - 104:47)
purposely put them in non touristy SP (104:43 - 104:51)
spaces and no one thought that hey maybe (104:47 - 104:53)
this is might be a disaster in Amsterdam (104:51 - 104:55)
unless we have some sort of plan going (104:53 - 104:57)
forward I'm glad they have a plan now it (104:55 - 104:59)
sounds like um and it doesn't sound like (104:57 - 105:02)
anyone got hurt so that's a decent (104:59 - 105:04)
takeaway cuz people can definitely get (105:02 - 105:07)
hurt in that kind of yeah environment (105:04 - 105:08)
especially with what those clips were (105:07 - 105:13)
showing it look like but what a what a a (105:08 - 105:16)
disgusting thing to wake up to and been (105:13 - 105:18)
like oh I guess we're starting our day (105:16 - 105:21)
with this Pokemon news yeah (105:18 - 105:25)
so if you want the vano stuff be patient (105:21 - 105:28)
um it sounds like I'm sure I'm not sure (105:25 - 105:30)
the items are coming back I think it's (105:28 - 105:31)
just the (105:30 - 105:34)
card I I I think they'll I think they'll (105:31 - 105:36)
print the plush in I think if if (105:34 - 105:38)
anything's coming back it's the plush (105:36 - 105:42)
Fair still don't go to eBay even if even (105:38 - 105:44)
even if they don't print or they don't (105:42 - 105:47)
make any more stuff just don't go to (105:44 - 105:49)
eBay because if you want to at some (105:47 - 105:51)
point the price is still will come down (105:49 - 105:53)
a little bit I think they're going to (105:51 - 105:56)
drop so like just don't do anything (105:53 - 105:59)
right now just just hold steady and you (105:56 - 106:00)
got to be a little patient un I feel (105:59 - 106:02)
like this is GameStop stock hold hold (106:00 - 106:06)
the line hold the forts don't (106:02 - 106:10)
buy yep let it crash yeah just uh yeah (106:06 - 106:13)
just just wait I mean I hate like I (106:10 - 106:15)
don't obviously like it's really cool (106:13 - 106:17)
stuff right you want to get it and you (106:15 - 106:20)
want to um you want to have it but I (106:17 - 106:22)
think the best thing is to wait and (106:20 - 106:24)
definitely don't pay those overpriced (106:22 - 106:27)
things on eBay because that just that (106:24 - 106:28)
will just make it continue to happen (106:27 - 106:30)
right I mean it will probably continue (106:28 - 106:33)
to happen anyways unfortunately but and (106:30 - 106:35)
if you have this stuff please don't sell (106:33 - 106:39)
it on eBay way overprice like like I (106:35 - 106:42)
don't know just don't don't do that so (106:39 - 106:45)
yeah well I think that is our show for (106:42 - 106:47)
y'all (106:45 - 106:50)
um got a lot to cover this week uh I'll (106:47 - 106:52)
be recording from South Korea I'm not (106:50 - 106:54)
sure exactly what that situation will be (106:52 - 106:56)
like or what a random Hotel I'll be in (106:54 - 106:58)
but we'll figure it out uh I think that (106:56 - 107:03)
episode will probably be how a soul (106:58 - 107:05)
Safari Zone would look like last time (107:03 - 107:06)
they had it in South Korea it was in y (107:05 - 107:10)
goyang uh it was in their park out there (107:06 - 107:13)
that was the you could only play Safari (107:10 - 107:16)
Zone in that specific Park in goyang um (107:13 - 107:19)
which was a bit outside of soul and this (107:16 - 107:22)
is supposed to be anywhere inso City (107:19 - 107:24)
experience which we have seen Niantic (107:22 - 107:28)
over the last couple months slash year (107:24 - 107:30)
or two lean into that City experience (107:28 - 107:33)
and it sounds like in New York it sounds (107:30 - 107:36)
like in okaka that people just prefer (107:33 - 107:37)
the city experience now there are some (107:36 - 107:42)
downsides to that obviously um but I (107:37 - 107:45)
think there's supposed to (107:42 - 107:47)
be (107:45 - 107:50)
uh not monuments but like uh locations (107:47 - 107:52)
that you can go to for like trading (107:50 - 107:54)
battling hydration even though it's (107:52 - 107:55)
still a city experience I don't know (107:54 - 107:57)
what the word for that is like landmarks (107:55 - 107:58)
or something landmarks yeah points of (107:57 - 108:00)
interest like points of interest that (107:58 - 108:01)
Niantic is putting up I think there (108:00 - 108:03)
should be points of interest in the city (108:01 - 108:06)
but still have the city experience so um (108:03 - 108:07)
if you want to see what that looks like (108:06 - 108:10)
I'll be streaming that on Twitch um uh (108:07 - 108:12)
technically Friday night because Korea (108:10 - 108:14)
is in the future Friday and Saturday (108:12 - 108:18)
