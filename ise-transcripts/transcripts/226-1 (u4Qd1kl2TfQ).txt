[Music] (0:02 - 0:24)
what is up everyone my name is SBJ and (0:20 - 0:27)
this is a special episode of the Pokemon (0:24 - 0:31)
podcast it's super effective before we (0:27 - 0:33)
get to this let's introduce the round (0:31 - 0:36)
table of contestants I don't know what (0:33 - 0:38)
that means uh we have Travis here you (0:36 - 0:41)
started this by saying what's up (0:38 - 0:44)
everybody but but this isn't for (0:41 - 0:46)
everybody this is this is for that that (0:44 - 0:50)
special few who who uh who are willing (0:46 - 0:52)
to uh shook in a little change to hear (0:50 - 0:55)
this episode that's true yes (0:52 - 0:58)
yeah we we'll get to why why it's been (0:55 - 1:00)
delayed too uh we also have (0:58 - 1:04)
regular old uh will (1:00 - 1:07)
here you need to be careful with your (1:04 - 1:10)
words you need to be real careful (1:07 - 1:12)
especially since I'm going to see you in (1:10 - 1:15)
less than two weeks and I stay angry for (1:12 - 1:18)
a long time you hold yeah I uh I get (1:15 - 1:21)
over things real quick will not so much (1:18 - 1:25)
not at all regular and old so brutal my (1:21 - 1:29)
my uh my my motto is never forgive and (1:25 - 1:30)
never forget (1:29 - 1:31)
[Laughter] (1:30 - 1:34)
and we have uh our classic I forget if I (1:31 - 1:36)
forgive or or not I don't remember well (1:34 - 1:38)
we have our classic fourth wheel here we (1:36 - 1:41)
have Micah the bra can I just say how (1:38 - 1:43)
disappointed I am it's not Logan but (1:41 - 1:46)
whatever go (1:43 - 1:46)
on the daggers are out on this episode (1:46 - 1:53)
dude he called us contestants it's time (1:51 - 1:55)
to travel the (1:53 - 1:58)
we I hope the shade continues throughout (1:55 - 2:01)
the whole episode I bet when you guys (1:58 - 2:03)
shelled out money to pay for episodes (2:01 - 2:05)
like this you didn't expect that you'd (2:03 - 2:07)
hear my voice otherwise you probably (2:05 - 2:09)
wouldn't have paid (2:07 - 2:11)
anything oh yeah yeah so if you're (2:09 - 2:14)
listening to this you are either a (2:11 - 2:16)
Kickstarter backer that pledged at the (2:14 - 2:19)
$10 or higher level or you are a patreon (2:16 - 2:22)
backer that pledges at the $10 or higher (2:19 - 2:24)
level now there's not that many patreon (2:22 - 2:27)
backers pledging at the 10 high $10 or (2:24 - 2:29)
higher level but originally this episode (2:27 - 2:33)
was uh starter exclusive and I figured (2:29 - 2:36)
that we have like 15 people on patreon (2:33 - 2:37)
that pledge $10 a month and they've been (2:36 - 2:39)
pledging that for a couple months so I (2:37 - 2:40)
figured we'd give them access to this (2:39 - 2:43)
episode too now like I said before this (2:40 - 2:46)
episode what is designed for Kickstarter (2:43 - 2:49)
only uh that's why you guys are hearing (2:46 - 2:51)
this or hopefully listening to it (2:49 - 2:52)
hopefully you'll enjoy this but the (2:51 - 2:55)
reason it was so late was there was a (2:52 - 2:58)
lot of microphone changing that I have (2:55 - 3:00)
no good excuse I have a lot of little (2:58 - 3:02)
excuses but it doesn't really uh it (3:00 - 3:04)
doesn't really compensate for why it's (3:02 - 3:08)
late I I guess I'm sorry it's late but (3:04 - 3:11)
to be fair we're still earlier than most (3:08 - 3:14)
kickstarters on the delivery so we have (3:11 - 3:16)
that going for us I finally got Travis a (3:14 - 3:18)
microphone that I think that they and I (3:16 - 3:20)
are both satisfied (3:18 - 3:25)
with I like it cool uh will has a (3:20 - 3:28)
microphone that is adequate to his voice (3:25 - 3:30)
and Micah I didn't give anything he (3:28 - 3:32)
bought his own microphone I guess that's (3:30 - 3:35)
why why he's (3:32 - 3:38)
here well Technic you didn't give me (3:35 - 3:41)
anything either I did send you a a (3:38 - 3:43)
couple things one thing oh wait that (3:41 - 3:46)
little yeah that that foam yes yes the (3:43 - 3:48)
phone yes and and there will be there (3:46 - 3:50)
will be more upgrades and everything (3:48 - 3:52)
because of the patreon and obviously the (3:50 - 3:53)
kickstarter helped with that the other (3:52 - 3:55)
reason why the episode was so kind of (3:53 - 3:58)
delayed was because I I never knew a (3:55 - 4:00)
strong enough topic to deliver to you (3:58 - 4:02)
guys Pokémon news comes and goes and (4:00 - 4:04)
there's a lot of Pokemon news some weeks (4:02 - 4:05)
there's not enough other weeks but I (4:04 - 4:07)
didn't want to do like a oh let's do a (4:05 - 4:10)
Safari Zone episode but then it's like (4:07 - 4:11)
that's something we could do for (4:10 - 4:13)
everyone and I wouldn't want everyone to (4:11 - 4:15)
miss out on something like that or let's (4:13 - 4:17)
do like our favorite Gym Leaders but (4:15 - 4:19)
again that's kind of for everyone (4:17 - 4:21)
finding the topic was what took the (4:19 - 4:24)
longest and I think the topic today (4:21 - 4:25)
which will take up the entire episode (4:24 - 4:28)
will be both entertaining and fun for us (4:25 - 4:31)
and fun for you guys what we're doing (4:28 - 4:33)
what this episode is about is before (4:31 - 4:36)
Generation 7 comes out before we get x (4:33 - 4:39)
amount of new Pokemon we are going to do (4:36 - 4:44)
a top 10 of our Four's top 10 Pokemon (4:39 - 4:48)
smashed together and uh the show itself (4:44 - 4:51)
is designed around debate and cutting (4:48 - 4:53)
favorite Pokemon out that we like to (4:51 - 4:56)
really form 10 Pokémon that the four of (4:53 - 4:58)
us can agree on so what's going to (4:56 - 5:00)
happen is what's going to happen is is (4:58 - 5:01)
none of mine are going to make it to the (5:00 - 5:04)
actual final top 10 because no one likes (5:01 - 5:07)
any of the Pokemon I like same so why (5:04 - 5:09)
don't we just cut to the Chase and take (5:07 - 5:13)
Steve and Will's top 10 in wh Whitt down (5:09 - 5:16)
together we're all going to go around (5:13 - 5:18)
and we're we have we have 10 Pokemon (5:16 - 5:20)
each that we've picked prior to the show (5:18 - 5:23)
so our personal top 10 favorite Pokemon (5:20 - 5:25)
and mine always changes I feel so I (5:23 - 5:28)
wrote I wrote my top 10 uh this this (5:25 - 5:30)
past week which will would be different (5:28 - 5:31)
if you give me another week to think (5:30 - 5:33)
about it but we're all going to go (5:31 - 5:37)
around the table and nominate one (5:33 - 5:39)
nominate our Pokémon and then kind of (5:37 - 5:41)
explain why we like that Pokemon then (5:39 - 5:43)
we're going to have a list of 40 or so (5:41 - 5:46)
Pokemon because the out of out of the (5:43 - 5:48)
four of us we might share one or two (5:46 - 5:49)
favorites so maybe we'll have like 38 (5:48 - 5:52)
Pokémon and then once that's done we're (5:49 - 5:55)
going to go round table again and we're (5:52 - 5:57)
going to then pick a Pokemon to (5:55 - 5:59)
eliminate so there's going to be a list (5:57 - 6:00)
of 40 (5:59 - 6:03)
10 of 10 of our our Pokemon each and (6:00 - 6:04)
then like let's start with we maybe (6:03 - 6:06)
start with M and say m out of the 40 you (6:04 - 6:08)
see which one do you think doesn't (6:06 - 6:11)
belong in the list and let's say that (6:08 - 6:13)
Travis picks vanilla spoiler he probably (6:11 - 6:15)
did pick vanilla I'm not sure (6:13 - 6:19)
but uh so Micah goes uh I think vanilla (6:15 - 6:21)
can cut I don't think vanilla is top 10 (6:19 - 6:24)
material Travis has a chance then to (6:21 - 6:27)
defend and keep it on the list but then (6:24 - 6:30)
we know in the future that vanilla is (6:27 - 6:34)
already been you know outed once so at (6:30 - 6:35)
some point there's going to be (6:34 - 6:37)
everyone's going to defend to a point (6:35 - 6:39)
where we're going to have to go around (6:37 - 6:41)
again and then will can go all right (6:39 - 6:43)
Travis like this list is getting thin I (6:41 - 6:45)
still don't think vanilla is top 10 (6:43 - 6:47)
we're going to cut it at that point (6:45 - 6:49)
Travis would have to have a really (6:47 - 6:53)
really strong argument to keep vanilla (6:49 - 6:56)
from getting cut twice and somehow we're (6:53 - 6:58)
going to get it down to 10 Pokemon I (6:56 - 7:00)
don't know how once we we get down to 10 (6:58 - 7:02)
we're going to arrange those 10 into a (7:00 - 7:06)
top 10 and that is going to be your (7:02 - 7:09)
episode a plus so I I think that (7:06 - 7:10)
hopefully it will cause some debate it (7:09 - 7:12)
will cause some laughter it will bring (7:10 - 7:14)
out some personalities that's kind of (7:12 - 7:16)
the big thing I wanted to grab on is (7:14 - 7:18)
just our personalities and how uh Mike (7:16 - 7:20)
and I were talking about this before the (7:18 - 7:22)
show of how like after we made our list (7:20 - 7:23)
we felt like we fit into a certain type (7:22 - 7:25)
of Pokemon personality and I don't want (7:23 - 7:28)
to spoil what that what that is but I (7:25 - 7:29)
learned a lot about myself writing this (7:28 - 7:30)
list (7:29 - 7:33)
that I didn't know before yeah so I (7:30 - 7:34)
think I think this is something we could (7:33 - 7:37)
probably even do after gen 7 comes out (7:34 - 7:39)
or even with another group of people (7:37 - 7:41)
whether like this list would be so (7:39 - 7:43)
drastic If Logan was here or if Irene (7:41 - 7:46)
was here or if anyone else was here to (7:43 - 7:48)
add to that or to subtract to that like (7:46 - 7:50)
we could probably get rid of a lot of (7:48 - 7:52)
flower Pokemon if we cut will out right (7:50 - 7:54)
now but wait what what makes you think I (7:52 - 7:57)
have a single flower Pokemon on my list (7:54 - 7:59)
I feel like you have one flower Pokemon (7:57 - 8:01)
on the Avatar that I'm looking at that (7:59 - 8:03)
is your avatar right now is literally a (8:01 - 8:05)
flower Pokemon (8:03 - 8:07)
[Music] (8:05 - 8:12)
well I don't think it's a flower Pokemon (8:07 - 8:16)
so what we're GNA and I'm also doing I'm (8:12 - 8:18)
also recording my screen in the Google (8:16 - 8:19)
Doc because we need to make we need to (8:18 - 8:23)
keep a list so not only that we know (8:19 - 8:25)
what 40 there are but so we can update (8:23 - 8:27)
you what the list is so if you hear a (8:25 - 8:29)
little bit of typing I know that (8:27 - 8:30)
normally in an episode of it super (8:29 - 8:32)
effective I'm very against like typing (8:30 - 8:34)
or eating or other noises cuz I want the (8:32 - 8:36)
show to sound as good as possible but in (8:34 - 8:37)
this episode there probably will be a (8:36 - 8:39)
little typ in cuz we are I I have not (8:37 - 8:42)
seen anyone else's list so I don't know (8:39 - 8:44)
what they actually picked so I do want (8:42 - 8:45)
to like type and have them add it to the (8:44 - 8:47)
list so we have this ultimate list that (8:45 - 8:49)
we can start whittling down cuz it would (8:47 - 8:53)
be it would be more Awkward or more not (8:49 - 8:54)
pleasant to hear if we're trying to (8:53 - 8:58)
recall the two of Travis's Pokémon um (8:54 - 9:00)
because we didn't write them down (8:58 - 9:02)
uh but yeah that's our intro hopefully (9:00 - 9:05)
you enjoy this I think it's time to get (9:02 - 9:07)
into it does anyone want to start with (9:05 - 9:10)
their first Pokemon and we can kind of (9:07 - 9:12)
Go Round Table here or do you guys how (9:10 - 9:13)
do we go around in a circle when we're (9:12 - 9:16)
over the Internet yeah I I well how (9:13 - 9:19)
about I start I start we'll go to Travis (9:16 - 9:21)
we'll go to Will and then we'll go to (9:19 - 9:25)
Micah that's kind of from first order (9:21 - 9:27)
the order of how important we are to the (9:25 - 9:31)
show Bingo na it yes I was going to say (9:27 - 9:33)
I was going to say the order of when we (9:31 - 9:36)
first appeared on the show but (9:33 - 9:38)
importance one half dozen and the other (9:36 - 9:41)
but the claws are out so this episode's (9:38 - 9:44)
already brutal all right my first pick (9:41 - 9:48)
to go on this list is chandeler I don't (9:44 - 9:50)
know if that's surprising to anyone I (9:48 - 9:52)
think chandelier is one of the best (9:50 - 9:55)
Pokemon of generation 5 Ghost Fire which (9:52 - 9:57)
is a very unique type and he's based off (9:55 - 9:59)
of Chandelier and now when I see (9:57 - 10:02)
chandeliers in public spaces I always (9:59 - 10:04)
accidentally say chandelier so that is (10:02 - 10:07)
why I'm nominating chandelier for my (10:04 - 10:10)
first Pokemon on my list all right so (10:07 - 10:12)
will you makes sense to me now why you (10:10 - 10:14)
say lur I was just going to say the same (10:12 - 10:16)
thing it's like will you ever pronounce (10:14 - 10:17)
it (10:16 - 10:21)
correctly lur no it has two syllables (10:17 - 10:25)
lure lure lure there you go two (10:21 - 10:26)
syllables (10:25 - 10:30)
lure oh my God it's happening (10:26 - 10:32)
it's all downhill (10:30 - 10:35)
chandel maybe that is why I say lure cuz (10:32 - 10:36)
a (10:35 - 10:38)
Chandelure top 10 material right there (10:36 - 10:40)
all right Travis what do you got what do (10:38 - 10:43)
you got so I actually have mine even on (10:40 - 10:46)
my own list ranked 10 to one so my (10:43 - 10:50)
number 10 um I actually had a change of (10:46 - 10:52)
heart in the last few minutes before we (10:50 - 10:54)
started recording this previously this (10:52 - 10:57)
place this number 10 spot was held by (10:54 - 11:00)
celby but I changed my mind because now (10:57 - 11:04)
my top 10 list got an injection of swag (11:00 - 11:08)
from honch Crow honch Crow do I have to (11:04 - 11:10)
type when I say them uh you can you can (11:08 - 11:12)
type it in after or before when somebody (11:10 - 11:14)
else is talking I'm just making the list (11:12 - 11:18)
here okay so the reason I like honchkrow (11:14 - 11:20)
uh so for all these I'll give a personal (11:18 - 11:22)
reason and then an attempt at an (11:20 - 11:24)
objective reason the personal reason for (11:22 - 11:27)
honchkrow uh is Generation 4 is a (11:24 - 11:30)
generation where my brother and and I (11:27 - 11:32)
were quite close where my brother and I (11:30 - 11:35)
played together the most and a running (11:32 - 11:37)
joke grew out of that play through where (11:35 - 11:40)
my brother uh my brother likes honow (11:37 - 11:42)
even more than I do and played through (11:40 - 11:46)
the game his his run through of pearl uh (11:42 - 11:49)
with uh honchkrow and perpetually said (11:46 - 11:52)
that he was rolling with the honch which (11:49 - 11:55)
uh isn't funny but it also really is (11:52 - 11:58)
funny I don't know I laughed instantly (11:55 - 12:01)
so so so that's the personal reason for (11:58 - 12:03)
it um aesthetically I also just think (12:01 - 12:06)
it's it's uh cool and then for the more (12:03 - 12:08)
uh for the less personal reason the (12:06 - 12:11)
design of of sort of like a uh (12:08 - 12:14)
prohibition era gangster in a Pokemon uh (12:11 - 12:19)
and making that concept into a this sort (12:14 - 12:22)
of elegant Crow I think is a beautiful (12:19 - 12:25)
way to craft that uh that concept of of (12:22 - 12:27)
that time period and and that group of (12:25 - 12:29)
people into uh monster design and I (12:27 - 12:31)
think that's awesome so hon Crow is my (12:29 - 12:33)
number 10 awesome you're your column two (12:31 - 12:35)
by the way in the Google Doc okay will (12:33 - 12:38)
what what do you got for us so what what (12:35 - 12:41)
am I going to go with first I don't want (12:38 - 12:45)
to presume any sort of order of (12:41 - 12:48)
favoritism Al did there are clear yes (12:45 - 12:50)
you did you said number 10 was honchkrow (12:48 - 12:52)
so we know that's the first one you (12:50 - 12:55)
don't care about knock out you got to (12:52 - 12:57)
understand strategy brother we know the (12:55 - 13:01)
first cut I don't know yeah like it (12:57 - 13:03)
doesn't matter because I wouldn't care (13:01 - 13:07)
about defending that one as much so dang (13:03 - 13:10)
let me go with the one that everybody (13:07 - 13:13)
knows is absolutely going to be on my (13:10 - 13:17)
list without question always for all (13:13 - 13:19)
time I (13:17 - 13:24)
know don't be so sure be pretty anxious (13:19 - 13:29)
forever but uh Cinda quill would be (13:24 - 13:33)
an easy ad on my list just because (13:29 - 13:34)
that's just my favorite starter of all (13:33 - 13:38)
the starters ever well I maybe that's (13:34 - 13:39)
actually Up For Debate in my own mind (13:38 - 13:42)
but seeing as I have multiple voices in (13:39 - 13:44)
my head they each get to have a favorite (13:42 - 13:46)
but syndic Quil is just a very strong (13:44 - 13:48)
one with a number of the voices in my (13:46 - 13:52)
head for its use of my own name in in (13:48 - 13:55)
the Pokemon name and the fact that it's (13:52 - 13:57)
the cutest starter of well almost the (13:55 - 14:00)
cutest starter of all the starters all (13:57 - 14:01)
right we know we're cutting syndic Quil (14:00 - 14:04)
because Will's going back and (14:01 - 14:06)
forth but I love it it's so cute it's a (14:04 - 14:10)
little fire Mouse and I have and and it (14:06 - 14:13)
just it's cuddly and warm I've i' I know (14:10 - 14:15)
I've gone over this in past episodes of (14:13 - 14:17)
the podcast but it just syndic Quil is (14:15 - 14:21)
just such a sweet nice warm friendly (14:17 - 14:23)
little guy that that's absolutely has to (14:21 - 14:26)
be on my list all right all right you (14:23 - 14:27)
want to add that Micah what do we got (14:26 - 14:29)
what do we got for your first pick all (14:27 - 14:31)
right so when I wrote this list I didn't (14:29 - 14:33)
write it in any real specific order I (14:31 - 14:37)
went accidentally by generation and kind (14:33 - 14:40)
of went through each generation and I (14:37 - 14:43)
wanted to pick things that Pokemon that (14:40 - 14:47)
I liked from each generation and so (14:43 - 14:50)
I for those just listening to the audio (14:47 - 14:56)
will po Emoji into uh M column on (14:50 - 14:59)
our off to a great start be a 7even hour (14:56 - 15:03)
I feel I feel well respected and like my (14:59 - 15:04)
like my points are going to be taken (15:03 - 15:05)
into (15:04 - 15:08)
consideration this is going really great (15:05 - 15:12)
for me so it's my order I guess is by (15:08 - 15:15)
generation okay I have a few from each (15:12 - 15:18)
and I have I wrote like a paragraph for (15:15 - 15:20)
each of these for why I think that they (15:18 - 15:22)
should be on the list but what I'm going (15:20 - 15:24)
to do is I'm going to go with a personal (15:22 - 15:26)
reason initially and then when I need to (15:24 - 15:29)
defend them because I inevitably will I (15:26 - 15:31)
have more reasons all right that are (15:29 - 15:34)
specific to these to these Pokemon so my (15:31 - 15:37)
first Pokemon is Gengar the reason for (15:34 - 15:40)
that is because similar to uh Travis's (15:37 - 15:43)
reason with honchkrow my brother and I (15:40 - 15:47)
both started with generation one and we (15:43 - 15:49)
were both really into it and the Pokemon (15:47 - 15:52)
that we even over time have continued to (15:49 - 15:55)
love the most has been Gengar because (15:52 - 15:59)
he's such a weird and fun Pokemon he's (15:55 - 16:02)
so straight like but my my initial my (15:59 - 16:05)
like first memory of Gengar was watching (16:02 - 16:07)
him on the show when they did the (16:05 - 16:10)
episode where they went into the to the (16:07 - 16:13)
mansion Ash and Pikachu and the other (16:10 - 16:15)
starter Pokemon went into the mansion (16:13 - 16:17)
and Gastly Haunter and Gengar just (16:15 - 16:21)
terrorized them and it was probably one (16:17 - 16:23)
of the most fun episodes in my opinion (16:21 - 16:26)
from the Kanto region I do remember that (16:23 - 16:28)
episode was good MH yeah it's also the (16:26 - 16:31)
episode where his soul left his body and (16:28 - 16:34)
he almost didn't get back into it why so (16:31 - 16:38)
fun uh my second choice is actually a (16:34 - 16:40)
legendary Pokemon oh my mistake it is a (16:38 - 16:45)
mythical Pokemon it will be Gerra from (16:40 - 16:47)
Generation 4 look my favorite Pokemon I (16:45 - 16:49)
don't even one of my favorite Pokemon I (16:47 - 16:50)
don't even know what generation from (16:49 - 16:53)
three I think it's it was like this C of (16:50 - 16:56)
Generation 3 the celby of generation or (16:53 - 16:59)
the Mew of Generation 3 for there you go (16:56 - 17:00)
typical way of (16:59 - 17:03)
articulating of generation five then Gen (17:00 - 17:07)
4 had manafi and fion oh yeah yeah yeah (17:03 - 17:09)
they're not as cool uh yeah I like Gerra (17:07 - 17:12)
a lot I think to me Gerra was never on (17:09 - 17:16)
my radar until I saw Geri wish maker one (17:12 - 17:18)
of the Pokemon movies and just seeing (17:16 - 17:21)
Gerra in motion and actually know like (17:18 - 17:24)
that is the first movie where I noticed (17:21 - 17:28)
jra's eye on its stomach that it opens (17:24 - 17:30)
and it's kind of creepy but at the same (17:28 - 17:32)
time it's really really cool mostly (17:30 - 17:35)
creepy maybe I have a theme H here of (17:32 - 17:37)
Chandelier and Dai both being kind of (17:35 - 17:41)
creepy Pokemon but just I love the anime (17:37 - 17:43)
and the aspect of seeing Pokemon (17:41 - 17:45)
actually having fluid movement and (17:43 - 17:48)
interacting and how they react in the (17:45 - 17:50)
environment I think that's really cool (17:48 - 17:51)
and that's one of my biggest draws the (17:50 - 17:53)
anime and Gerra wishmaker made me a huge (17:51 - 17:57)
fan of just Gerra and that Pokemon so (17:53 - 17:59)
yeah that's my second choice TR (17:57 - 18:02)
since no one else is doing uh 10 to one (17:59 - 18:04)
order I'll stop doing it and go in a (18:02 - 18:06)
random order another Pokemon in my top (18:04 - 18:10)
10 list is meow that's (18:06 - 18:12)
right I mean that comes as no surprise (18:10 - 18:14)
to anyone I think you just said that two (18:12 - 18:16)
weeks ago that was a really good (18:14 - 18:21)
pun oh that too wow I missed that it was (18:16 - 18:23)
really good let that uh let that joke (18:21 - 18:26)
sink before I go in (18:23 - 18:29)
okay Meowth is great to me personally (18:26 - 18:32)
because when I took the Pokemon Mystery (18:29 - 18:36)
Dungeon 2 explorers of Time quiz it told (18:32 - 18:39)
me I was a Meowth because I am sassy (18:36 - 18:41)
that's when I realized how identical (18:39 - 18:46)
Meowth and I are we're both little thing (18:41 - 18:50)
little wimps that can't that basically (18:46 - 18:55)
can't defend ourselves but we talk a big (18:50 - 18:55)
game but I also I also like it uh (18:55 - 19:01)
separated from the characterization of (18:58 - 19:04)
um of the anime I also just uh think the (19:01 - 19:07)
design of the Pokemon is as the uh like (19:04 - 19:10)
a lucky cat that I don't know if it is (19:07 - 19:12)
Japanese or or if generally just East (19:10 - 19:14)
Asian but I think it has Japanese (19:12 - 19:16)
origins of the lucky cat statues that (19:14 - 19:19)
it's based on um I think that's neat um (19:16 - 19:23)
and then obviously the uh Meowth as I (19:19 - 19:25)
don't actually like the Meowth character (19:23 - 19:28)
in the anime as much as a lot of people (19:25 - 19:29)
uh as much as I like the Pokemon (19:28 - 19:32)
generally but I know a lot of people (19:29 - 19:33)
like it so you're not going to strike it (19:32 - 19:36)
down because you like meow so do you (19:33 - 19:40)
know the Fable of nekochan uh no so it (19:36 - 19:44)
does hearken back to Chinese times but (19:40 - 19:45)
there was a nobleman riding a horse (19:44 - 19:48)
close to a Buddhist temple and he was (19:45 - 19:50)
stopping to rest under a tree because he (19:48 - 19:53)
saw a storm coming and he saw a cat at (19:50 - 19:56)
the door of the temple beckoning to him (19:53 - 19:58)
to come forward and as the nobleman (19:56 - 20:00)
entered the temple lightning struck the (19:58 - 20:02)
tree and it fell where he had been on (20:00 - 20:04)
his horse so the beckoning cat saved him (20:02 - 20:07)
from certain disaster and therefore the (20:04 - 20:09)
beckoning cat is seen as lucky sounds (20:07 - 20:12)
like that horse died though I (20:09 - 20:15)
know that horse not so much that horse (20:12 - 20:17)
not lucky he rode his horse into the (20:15 - 20:20)
temple oh okay I see all right cuz it (20:17 - 20:22)
wasn't on alpaca that's why yeah that's (20:20 - 20:24)
right well will what's your what's your (20:22 - 20:26)
Pokemon my next Pokemon is going to be (20:24 - 20:29)
Chespin another wonderful starter that (20:26 - 20:31)
has given me so much happiness I have a (20:29 - 20:36)
Chespin hat I played Chespin on Pokemon (20:31 - 20:39)
Y that was my starter from Pokemon Y and (20:36 - 20:41)
I actually throughout playing that game (20:39 - 20:43)
brought him up to level 100 because I (20:41 - 20:45)
loved him so much I never let him evolve (20:43 - 20:50)
so I do have a level 100 name Chespin um (20:45 - 20:51)
and he's absolutely one of my favorite (20:50 - 20:53)
starters because he's so cute and so (20:51 - 20:57)
sassy uh in the cartoon um and he always (20:53 - 20:58)
falls in love with everybody body and (20:57 - 21:00)
they never return his affections so he's (20:58 - 21:04)
very much like me okay chin peace chesin (21:00 - 21:06)
uh Micah what is your second Pokemon on (21:04 - 21:10)
the list my second Pokemon is Eevee not (21:06 - 21:13)
only because Eevee is super adorable (21:10 - 21:16)
it's like a little puppy cat that you (21:13 - 21:19)
can hold and it's adorable and it's cute (21:16 - 21:21)
that's it that's the only argument who (21:19 - 21:23)
invited the Gen wner to this debate (21:21 - 21:26)
that's the only two gen one (21:23 - 21:30)
Pokemon it's like the Donald Trump (21:26 - 21:35)
American political system now Wow (21:30 - 21:35)
Wow onlyon Let's make Pokemon great (21:35 - 21:40)
again let's go back to gen one yeah (21:38 - 21:43)
that's not the only reason why third (21:40 - 21:46)
Pokemon wait I'm not done no you can (21:43 - 21:48)
hold the EV debate when we eliminate it (21:46 - 21:50)
from the list of the let's let's cut our (21:48 - 21:52)
let's cut our rationale shorter because (21:50 - 21:54)
all these will be argued anyway yeah (21:52 - 21:55)
they're they're all going to be argued (21:54 - 21:57)
anyway in a sec well maybe some of them (21:55 - 21:59)
won't be argued but my third Pokemon is (21:57 - 22:02)
also a generation one Pokemon pretty I (21:59 - 22:04)
think predictable at this point it's (22:02 - 22:06)
going to be farfetched I don't know I (22:04 - 22:08)
don't know the exact reason I like (22:06 - 22:11)
farfetch at the moment I never actually (22:08 - 22:14)
knew why I like bird SL duck Pokemon and (22:11 - 22:17)
so far farfetch was the Pokemon in (22:14 - 22:19)
generation one that I was actually (22:17 - 22:22)
really upset that I couldn't catch in (22:19 - 22:23)
the wild because I hated the only way (22:22 - 22:25)
you could get it was from that trainer (22:23 - 22:27)
guy who trades you and his name is Duck (22:25 - 22:30)
and I hate when I cannot rename Pokemon (22:27 - 22:32)
but that's always stuck with me (22:30 - 22:35)
farfetched Travis what do you got that's (22:32 - 22:37)
one of two guaranteed gen one Pokemon in (22:35 - 22:41)
your list yes I'm going to uh I'm going (22:37 - 22:43)
to do the only it's strange because I (22:41 - 22:45)
love Gen 5 and I love a lot of the Gen 5 (22:43 - 22:47)
designs but I'm only I'm going to do the (22:45 - 22:49)
only Gen 5 pokemon on my list uh which (22:47 - 22:52)
all of you saw coming which is vanilla (22:49 - 22:56)
uh vanilla is great because the main (22:52 - 22:58)
reason is because I loved it instantly (22:56 - 22:59)
just just because because of its (22:58 - 23:01)
aesthetic and cheerfulness when it was (22:59 - 23:03)
announced and I loved that it's ice (23:01 - 23:06)
cream um and then when people started (23:03 - 23:07)
hating it I got really defensive and (23:06 - 23:10)
loved it even more all right all right (23:07 - 23:13)
good choice will third Pokemon uh my (23:10 - 23:17)
third Pokemon is going to be one of my (23:13 - 23:20)
other all-time favorites I think it's my (23:17 - 23:24)
favorite mythical Victini love Victini I (23:20 - 23:25)
would get a tattoo I will get a tattoo (23:24 - 23:28)
of Victini someday um but I just Lov the (23:25 - 23:31)
little you know fire luck Victory (23:28 - 23:33)
Pokemon he assures you're going to win (23:31 - 23:36)
and I played a Victini deck at us (23:33 - 23:38)
Nationals one year uh so he's just (23:36 - 23:40)
always been good to me love my little (23:38 - 23:43)
Victini there you go Micah you're number (23:40 - 23:46)
three get ready to hate it my number (23:43 - 23:50)
three choice will is celby which is not (23:46 - 23:54)
a gen one Pokemon and I like celby a lot (23:50 - 23:59)
because I like a spring onion it's it's (23:54 - 24:01)
an onion poke it's a fairy onion I love (23:59 - 24:05)
it I like celby a lot because it's uh it (24:01 - 24:08)
for some reason when I was younger and (24:05 - 24:10)
getting and really into Pokemon Mew (24:08 - 24:12)
didn't really appeal to me so celby kind (24:10 - 24:15)
of filled that hole as like the the (24:12 - 24:18)
extra mystery Pokemon that to me was a (24:15 - 24:21)
lot cooler than Mew was if these two are (24:18 - 24:24)
going to try to take down celby I'll (24:21 - 24:27)
I'll um I'll tag team with you because (24:24 - 24:30)
Cel is my honorable mentions list (24:27 - 24:32)
honorable I have a list of like seven (24:30 - 24:35)
honorable (24:32 - 24:35)
mentions I don't know what that is (24:35 - 24:40)
supposed to be that's that's the noise (24:38 - 24:42)
celby makes do you think I actually (24:40 - 24:45)
watch those movies theise Cel makes when (24:42 - 24:49)
we cut it from this list uh my next one (24:45 - 24:53)
is lotad says the guy with low get out (24:49 - 24:57)
of town and out of this Skype (24:53 - 25:00)
call look lad is just I wonder what's (24:57 - 25:04)
going to be struck (25:00 - 25:04)
first (25:04 - 25:09)
unforgivable low is incredible I mean (25:06 - 25:12)
platy are C no wait wait I need to hear (25:09 - 25:15)
the reason for that are legit I'm not (25:12 - 25:17)
giving you the reason unless we're (25:15 - 25:19)
getting it unless we're cutting it to (25:17 - 25:21)
Travis You're Number Four I see I see (25:19 - 25:24)
how the strategy is forming not uh not (25:21 - 25:26)
showing any of your defenses unless you (25:24 - 25:27)
need them so I'm going to I'm going to (25:26 - 25:31)
follow suit and I'm simply going to say (25:27 - 25:34)
gorist one of three gen 6 Pokemon on my (25:31 - 25:37)
list all right gorist is the pumpkin (25:34 - 25:40)
Pokemon for those who had to think about (25:37 - 25:42)
that know gorist because gorist is great (25:40 - 25:45)
it comes I'm not going to I was about to (25:42 - 25:47)
just jump into my defenses because you (25:45 - 25:49)
already triggering already triggering (25:47 - 25:52)
that will you're number You're Number (25:49 - 25:55)
Four my number four is also obvious to (25:52 - 25:57)
anybody who's known me for a long time (25:55 - 25:59)
and heard me talk about it but (25:57 - 26:01)
definitely Volcarona has to be on there (25:59 - 26:05)
that is my Allstar fire buug it helps me (26:01 - 26:08)
to hatch eggs quickly it helps me on (26:05 - 26:10)
anytime I do a playthrough I always make (26:08 - 26:13)
sure that I get a Volcarona up on there (26:10 - 26:14)
and it helps when you need a third fire (26:13 - 26:17)
Pokemon for your (26:14 - 26:21)
list poon what just happened to (26:17 - 26:24)
Will I I I didn't I don't know you guys (26:21 - 26:26)
cut out for a minute there oh you cut (26:24 - 26:28)
out for us it just said Bri you new (26:26 - 26:31)
fighter (26:28 - 26:31)
Pokemon I was going to have you repeat (26:31 - 26:36)
it and Cut N in that but no that's gold (26:33 - 26:38)
the reason you have so many fire type (26:36 - 26:41)
Pokemon is because you're possessed by a (26:38 - 26:43)
by a fiend from the underworld who's (26:41 - 26:46)
like burn burn it all reason I have so (26:43 - 26:48)
many fire Pokemon is because I am (26:46 - 26:52)
straight fire so whatever will is Micah (26:48 - 26:55)
your fourth Pokemon all right number (26:52 - 26:58)
four is Tyranitar which is a Sho in for (26:55 - 27:00)
any top 10 list purely because it's (26:58 - 27:03)
pretty much the Godzilla Pokemon that's (27:00 - 27:04)
it all right that's actually a real good (27:03 - 27:05)
defense off the (27:04 - 27:10)
bat uh my fifth Pokemon is (27:05 - 27:13)
Ducket no no response from anyone (27:10 - 27:15)
duckett's cool I guess all right all (27:13 - 27:18)
right all right I I no I used to know a (27:15 - 27:21)
kid at um League who used to like (27:18 - 27:23)
collect every Ducket card he's like (27:21 - 27:26)
obsessed with Ducket so Travis you're (27:23 - 27:29)
number your fifth Pokemon my favorite (27:26 - 27:31)
Pokemon of all time um and I don't think (27:29 - 27:34)
anyone's any unless something drastic (27:31 - 27:35)
changes in future gens which I don't (27:34 - 27:38)
think uh I I bet this will forever be my (27:35 - 27:41)
favorite Pokemon nothing will Dethrone (27:38 - 27:44)
uh it's Beauty And Glory pile of swine (27:41 - 27:46)
it's not pronounced pillow swine if you (27:44 - 27:47)
say pillow (27:46 - 27:51)
SW because pyos the prefix pyos (27:47 - 27:52)
indicates hairy so if any of you out (27:51 - 27:54)
there have ever said pillow swine cuz (27:52 - 27:56)
it's like a pillow cuz it's soft you (27:54 - 27:59)
should you can just (27:56 - 28:01)
is rivaling Will's list right now (27:59 - 28:03)

very icy doesn't it hm it's the second (28:03 - 28:09)
of two ice type Pokemon I mean hcro is (28:06 - 28:13)
pretty ice cuz he's straight Gangsta so (28:09 - 28:14)
I don't see that connection but all (28:13 - 28:15)
right all right don't see the connection (28:14 - 28:18)
between gangster and ice but go ahead (28:15 - 28:20)
it's like they yeah ice cold or they get (28:18 - 28:22)

Golduck (29:52 - 29:58)

cuts are coming but Golduck is my number (30:06 - 30:10)
six next we're going to go with the (30:08 - 30:14)
Pokemon that turned around my opinion on (30:10 - 30:17)

the necessity of a new type but made me (30:17 - 30:22)

leers no not on your list I certainly do (32:21 - 32:29)
not identify with a little floating (32:26 - 32:32)
flower baby as my heart and soul and (32:29 - 32:35)
spirit no that would be kierum the ice (32:32 - 32:38)
dragon oh wow that went in a different (32:35 - 32:40)
direction dude there is literally an (32:38 - 32:43)
emoji in our slack community of kierum (32:40 - 32:45)
just so I can express my (32:43 - 32:49)
opinion I forgot I made that emoji so (32:45 - 32:51)
that's why you put a cier on everything (32:49 - 32:54)
I say yes I've never noticed that really (32:51 - 32:56)
quick Micah what is your number eight (32:54 - 32:59)
seven seven uh keeping with Edge lord (32:56 - 33:04)
Pokemon uh my number seven is gutina and (32:59 - 33:08)
one of very few legendaries on here my (33:04 - 33:11)
number eight is going to be esper I'm a (33:08 - 33:14)
big cat person I feel like out of all (33:11 - 33:17)
the cat Pokemon we have I feel esper is (33:14 - 33:20)
the strongest that identifies with me (33:17 - 33:23)
and my love with for cats okay so I was (33:20 - 33:25)
just realizing that um honchkrow is (33:23 - 33:27)
definitely a cut eventually cuz I didn't (33:25 - 33:30)
even know how to spell it right hold (33:27 - 33:30)
on real good Perfect all right now that (33:31 - 33:36)
that has been rectified we're going to (33:34 - 33:38)
go with the second and last gen one (33:36 - 33:41)
Pokemon on my list and that is uh the (33:38 - 33:42)
pre-evolution of a Pokemon that's (33:41 - 33:44)
already on this list (33:42 - 33:47)
Psyduck all right so here's another (33:44 - 33:49)
Pokemon that I've used in actual (33:47 - 33:52)
competitions and I have used three times (33:49 - 33:55)
I have bred or had bred for me three (33:52 - 33:58)
different of these for competive play (33:55 - 34:01)
and that would be hydron we we have like (33:58 - 34:04)
every pseudo legendary dragon on this (34:01 - 34:06)
list Micah what do we got let's add (34:04 - 34:08)
another Pudo Legendary Dragon to this (34:06 - 34:11)
list well this is officially I think the (34:08 - 34:16)
first duplicate and my next pick is (34:11 - 34:18)
Chandelure oh okay uh we should do (34:16 - 34:20)
something in the in the why don't you (34:18 - 34:22)
add that to your list and then what I'll (34:20 - 34:25)
do is I'll add a like a tag to it yeah I (34:22 - 34:27)
have some very intense arguments for (34:25 - 34:31)
Chandelure so I feel like well maybe I (34:27 - 34:32)
have some very intense Arguments for (34:31 - 34:36)
Chandelure too good good cool we have a (34:32 - 34:38)
we have our first one's going to stay we (34:36 - 34:40)
have our first double that's cool my (34:38 - 34:43)
turn my ninth Pokemon on the list is (34:40 - 34:46)
going to be poly toad gen two I think (34:43 - 34:49)
might maybe my only generation 2 Pokemon (34:46 - 34:52)
uh I think poly toad I think was really (34:49 - 34:54)
cool because it's an extended family of (34:52 - 34:57)
the poly po worldl line and I think (34:54 - 34:59)
that's really cool that it has a split (34:57 - 35:01)
Evolution I want I would love more (34:59 - 35:04)
Pokemon to have a split Evolution but (35:01 - 35:07)
poo just is super unique and is actually (35:04 - 35:09)
one of the cooler frog Pokemon in the (35:07 - 35:13)
game I got nothing against froi I just (35:09 - 35:14)
when I think of frogs poly toad is the (35:13 - 35:16)
first that comes to mind uh too bad it's (35:14 - 35:16)
a (35:16 - 35:19)
[Laughter] (35:16 - 35:19)
toad all right Fair (35:20 - 35:25)
argument what's your ninth Pokemon (35:22 - 35:26)
Travis this is a Pokemon that meant a (35:25 - 35:30)
lot to me when I was a younger person (35:26 - 35:33)
Heracross will You're Number Nine uh one (35:30 - 35:36)
of the first Pokemon that I fell in love (35:33 - 35:39)
with from gen five and H my absolute (35:36 - 35:42)
favorite psychic type that's not Victini (35:39 - 35:44)
because Victini is psychic fire (35:42 - 35:46)
Reuniclus Reuniclus is also in my (35:44 - 35:49)
honorable mentions Micah your number (35:46 - 35:53)

some it's going to be omite our Lord and (36:17 - 36:22)
savior Lord (36:20 - 36:26)
Helix yes the meme Pokemon omite is my (36:22 - 36:28)
number Pokedex that's what its uh (36:26 - 36:31)

list drift (36:42 - 36:46)
blim (36:44 - 36:48)
interesting and now that you've seen my (36:46 - 36:50)
full list you can see that my list is (36:48 - 36:52)
superior than all the other lists I'll (36:50 - 36:54)
I'll read the I'll read the entire list (36:52 - 36:57)
before we start the cuts uh will your (36:54 - 37:01)
last Pokemon my last Pokemon boy that's (36:57 - 37:05)
a hard slot to fill but I think we're (37:01 - 37:09)
going to go with FL bab the cutest (37:05 - 37:12)
little fairy on a flower you ever (37:09 - 37:15)
saw and it just floats around on its (37:12 - 37:20)
flower and it's like FL FL it's so (37:15 - 37:23)
cute that one all (37:20 - 37:25)
right I really wish your mic would have (37:23 - 37:27)
cut out and done that like death fire (37:25 - 37:29)
talk you had (37:27 - 37:30)
before (37:29 - 37:32)
[Music] (37:30 - 37:33)
baby (37:32 - 37:36)
bab M your your final Pokemon on the (37:33 - 37:39)
list my final Pokemon I wrote twice as (37:36 - 37:42)
much about than everything else on my (37:39 - 37:46)
list and that final Pokemon is AIS slash (37:42 - 37:47)
are you realize we're supposed to be (37:46 - 37:49)
doing the top 10 Pokemon we like not (37:47 - 37:54)
just uh the Smogon top OU tier list (37:49 - 37:57)
right let me tell you that uh I (37:54 - 38:00)
I am terrible at competitive Pokemon so (37:57 - 38:02)
I also don't think people use AIS slash (38:00 - 38:04)
anymore but uh I've SE I think it's like (38:02 - 38:07)
the Bastion of Pokemon competitive play (38:04 - 38:09)
bash I've seen it unit used in doubles (38:07 - 38:11)
still yeah I think it's used in doubles (38:09 - 38:13)
I didn't know we were supposed to write (38:11 - 38:15)
paragraphs ahead of time I'm doing I (38:13 - 38:17)
certainly did not I mean I just prepared (38:15 - 38:20)
counterarguments that's all oh so I see (38:17 - 38:24)
Micah the teacher's pet got additional (38:20 - 38:28)
help okay I knew com into this that my (38:24 - 38:31)
list would be the most targeted so I (38:28 - 38:33)
prepared properly it's they call (38:31 - 38:34)
strategy it's interesting that they call (38:33 - 38:36)
you mic of the Brave uh when you're (38:34 - 38:38)
showing a lot of cowardice right now (38:36 - 38:40)

true um have a little confidence I'm (38:40 - 38:46)
ready let me let me read the list here (38:43 - 38:47)
we'll read the list then we'll take a (38:46 - 38:48)
break and then when we come back we'll (38:47 - 38:51)
start the cutting start the the brutal (38:48 - 38:52)
this podcast has already been pretty (38:51 - 38:54)
brutal but uh I'll start with my list (38:52 - 38:58)
here chandeler Gerra farfetch lotad (38:54 - 39:03)
Ducket gold duck Garbo esper poto and (38:58 - 39:08)
omite Travis is sporting hon Crow Meowth (39:03 - 39:14)

backed behind a syndic Quil a Chespin a (39:18 - 39:28)
Victini Buona cenf flame Zoroark cuum (39:22 - 39:32)
hydreon Reuniclus and flbe and finally (39:28 - 39:35)
Micah bringing up the rear here with (39:32 - 39:40)
Gengar Eevee celby Tyranitar shinja (39:35 - 39:45)
Garchomp gutina duplicate Chandelier (39:40 - 39:48)
hucha and AIS (39:45 - 39:51)
slash and uh so that is our list there's (39:48 - 39:53)
a video version you'll be able to see (39:51 - 39:54)
that I'm not sure if I'm going to do (39:53 - 39:57)
that or not still screen recording here (39:54 - 39:58)
but what we're going to do is we're (39:57 - 39:59)
going to take a quick break when we come (39:58 - 40:01)
back we will start cutting and defending (39:59 - 40:04)
Pokemon to whittle this list down to 10 (40:01 - 40:06)
and we're going to start backwards so (40:04 - 40:09)
Michael will begin the cuts will Travis (40:06 - 40:11)
then me and we'll full circle again (40:09 - 40:13)
until we get somewhat of a list we will (40:11 - 40:16)
be right (40:13 - 40:16)
back (40:25 - 40:28)
[Applause] (40:34 - 40:46)
[Music] (40:36 - 40:50)
[Applause] (40:46 - 40:50)
and we are back from our break to talk (40:52 - 40:58)
to start cutting Pokémon from this list (40:56 - 41:02)
we have 39 unique Pokemon chandelier is (40:58 - 41:04)
the only double on the list here between (41:02 - 41:07)
Micah and myself sharing that Pokemon (41:04 - 41:10)
we're going to start cutting and what's (41:07 - 41:11)
going to happen is we're going to start (41:10 - 41:13)
with Micah move to Will and Travis then (41:11 - 41:16)
myself Micah out of out of these Pokemon (41:13 - 41:17)
are going to nominate a Pokemon to get (41:16 - 41:19)
cut he's going he's going to give a (41:17 - 41:22)
reason why it should be cut or why it (41:19 - 41:24)
probably wouldn't make it to the top 10 (41:22 - 41:27)
that person if it's Travis for example (41:24 - 41:28)
and if it's vanilla I'm only using this (41:27 - 41:30)
example because that's what I used (41:28 - 41:34)
earlier Travis would attempt to defend (41:30 - 41:36)
and keep it on the list if the rest of (41:34 - 41:37)
us agree that it was a pretty good (41:36 - 41:40)
defense that Pokemon will become (41:37 - 41:42)
italicized again if this is an audio (41:40 - 41:43)
version we're just italicizing it for (41:42 - 41:47)
our benefit if Travis believes that okay (41:43 - 41:49)
I can defend it but even if I do defend (41:47 - 41:51)
it and keep on the list a little longer (41:49 - 41:53)
it's probably still not going to make it (41:51 - 41:54)
to the top 10 we're going to strike it (41:53 - 41:56)
out which means it's eliminated from the (41:54 - 41:59)
conversation moving forward we're going (41:56 - 42:01)
to try to whittle down these 39 Pokemon (41:59 - 42:03)
to get to a top 10 list to get to 10 (42:01 - 42:06)
Pokemon to form a top 10 list does that (42:03 - 42:09)
make sense how do we determine if (42:06 - 42:11)
someone's defense has been sufficient (42:09 - 42:13)
enough to prevent it from being stricken (42:11 - 42:16)
from the record I think one other so one (42:13 - 42:18)
other person that's there's four of us (42:16 - 42:21)
so if it was Micah asking for vanilla to (42:18 - 42:22)
get cut you defending it you would just (42:21 - 42:26)
need will or myself to agree with you to (42:22 - 42:27)
keep it (42:26 - 42:29)
and what if I want to upvote somebody (42:27 - 42:32)
else's rather than attacking somebody (42:29 - 42:35)
else's that's what we call cooperation (42:32 - 42:37)
and friendliness and that is not (42:35 - 42:40)
accepted in this Arena a if uh if there (42:37 - 42:44)
is a situation where both will and Micah (42:40 - 42:47)
feel strongly about cutting vanilla well (42:44 - 42:49)
if it's three verse one on a topic I (42:47 - 42:50)
don't think there's going to be a (42:49 - 42:52)
defense that's going to save it I think (42:50 - 42:54)
is that fair to everyone yeah yes unless (42:52 - 42:56)
it's a super good fence unless it's like (42:54 - 42:58)
the best defense we'll still hear the (42:56 - 43:00)
defense but it's probably not going to (42:58 - 43:02)
like if you hear the defense and then (43:00 - 43:03)
you and you might be able to change (43:02 - 43:06)
someone's mind so correct yeah and if (43:03 - 43:09)
it's a if it's the 2v2 we can italicize (43:06 - 43:11)
it but that's also sounding like it's (43:09 - 43:13)
probably not going to make it to the the (43:11 - 43:14)
final 10 I just don't want anyone to be (43:13 - 43:17)
like well everyone's gaining up on my (43:14 - 43:18)
Pokemon so that's why the italicize (43:17 - 43:20)
exists of like no let's keep it on the (43:18 - 43:22)
list a little longer cuz yeah what what (43:20 - 43:24)
Travis said is there's there's the (43:22 - 43:26)
possibility to change so right now we're (43:24 - 43:29)
trying to just trim the fat here um and (43:26 - 43:31)
yeah let's let's let's discuss things (43:29 - 43:34)
let's hash things out Micah you get the (43:31 - 43:37)
pleasure of the first cut which Pokemon (43:34 - 43:41)
do you think is Not Top 10 material on (43:37 - 43:44)
this list I'm going straight for (43:41 - 43:44)
lowed I don't see any redeemable (43:45 - 43:51)
qualities for this Pokemon other than (43:48 - 43:54)
that it is so ironically (43:51 - 43:57)
terrible terrible (43:54 - 43:59)
you know what I would even add to that (43:57 - 44:02)
that the the worst thing or yeah the (43:59 - 44:05)
worst thing about lotad is it's not even (44:02 - 44:07)
Ludicolo like Ludicolo would have a (44:05 - 44:10)
chance chance out there lad you didn't (44:07 - 44:14)
even go for the best of that tree Luda (44:10 - 44:17)
Colo is great let me let me get a (44:14 - 44:20)
defense here I I need to pull up a (44:17 - 44:22)
picture of those hands no I understand (44:20 - 44:24)
Luda Cola I knew what I was doing when I (44:22 - 44:27)
made this list lotad is is like a little (44:24 - 44:29)
duck head he has like this little beak (44:27 - 44:32)
he's real cute looking it's too yeah and (44:29 - 44:33)
and there just aren't any other ducks on (44:32 - 44:36)
your list so you needed some (44:33 - 44:38)
representation and he's Even's he's more (44:36 - 44:40)
like a platypus he's not even a duck can (44:38 - 44:43)
there a duck type platypuses are under (44:40 - 44:46)
the duck family puses are not under (44:43 - 44:50)
theck family they're mons they're very (44:46 - 44:52)
notably not (44:50 - 44:56)
Ducks they're noted they're noted for uh (44:52 - 44:59)
being mammals that like lay eggs or (44:56 - 45:03)
something lay EGS and they venom and (44:59 - 45:07)
poison yeah um and uh they're not Ducks (45:03 - 45:10)
those are the things they're known (45:07 - 45:14)
for L dad can like hide in the water (45:10 - 45:16)
because it looks like a lily pad but (45:14 - 45:18)
he's actually underneath it he's like (45:16 - 45:21)
the crocodile of cuteness all right and (45:18 - 45:24)
I'll even take a step back from that (45:21 - 45:26)
because he's more of a Lotus also the (45:24 - 45:30)
crocodile of cuteness is Sandile q e d I (45:26 - 45:32)
don't actually know what QED stands for (45:30 - 45:34)
and I have a Philosophy degree and I (45:32 - 45:38)
think it's actually QED the crocodile of (45:34 - 45:40)
cuteness is Sandile because it means (45:38 - 45:43)
like the result is got it I will I have (45:40 - 45:45)
I I will take the defeat of lowed I have (45:43 - 45:48)
struck him out him or her depending on (45:45 - 45:50)
your your gender of Pokemon rest in (45:48 - 45:53)
peace lowed LED's really cute the the (45:50 - 45:57)
first Tombstone LED's great also mic I'm (45:53 - 45:58)
going straight for your throat when it's (45:57 - 46:02)
my turn (45:58 - 46:02)
dang uh will what would you like to cut (46:02 - 46:09)
oh this is hard I mean there's there's a (46:06 - 46:11)
lot of good choices out here a lot of (46:09 - 46:16)
things and I a a multi- Pokemon (46:11 - 46:16)
affectionateness got to go that you know (46:25 - 46:31)
he's just was the worst of the starters (46:28 - 46:34)
from Gen 6 uh he's the only starter I (46:31 - 46:37)
didn't use in my two playthroughs of the (46:34 - 46:41)
game and he's just a pile of garbage and (46:37 - 46:43)
needs to go you uh you're talking about (46:41 - 46:47)
Garbodor right no cro croaky and he's (46:43 - 46:48)
right next to Garbodor you notice how (46:47 - 46:51)
convenient that is on the list see goes (46:48 - 46:55)
garbage J Garbodor (46:51 - 46:57)
kroi my defense for Froakie is that he (46:55 - 47:00)
fits into a category of Pokemon that I (46:57 - 47:02)
very much like which is the type of (47:00 - 47:04)
Pokemon that that is cute because it (47:02 - 47:08)
seems sort of oblivious in a way and the (47:04 - 47:11)
Gen 6 starters um and and starters (47:08 - 47:13)
generally I think desperately needed a (47:11 - 47:15)
Pokemon that was cute in that way (47:13 - 47:18)
generally starters are just cute things (47:15 - 47:20)
especially the first evolution of them (47:18 - 47:22)
uh they're they're traditionally cute (47:20 - 47:24)
they don't have weird shapes in them (47:22 - 47:26)
they're they're nice little circles (47:24 - 47:28)
generally or their sort of like bip (47:26 - 47:29)
pedal creatures that are cute in their (47:28 - 47:31)
own way uh froak is one of the first (47:29 - 47:34)
that you mean like ches pin oh yeah uh (47:31 - 47:35)
yeah chespin's cute but not as good as (47:34 - 47:38)
Froakie um Froakie is good because (47:35 - 47:40)
because of those um because its eyes (47:38 - 47:42)
that sort of pop out make a very strong (47:40 - 47:45)
silhouette yeah it's out and it gurgles (47:42 - 47:47)
bubbles from its mouth and like wears (47:45 - 47:48)
them as (47:47 - 47:50)
ornamentation I would use that I would (47:48 - 47:52)
use that as evidence that this is a (47:50 - 47:54)
great Pokemon because that that detail (47:52 - 47:56)
sticks in your brain it's not it it so (47:54 - 47:59)
it is whether you think that detail is (47:56 - 48:01)
interesting or not the fact that that (47:59 - 48:03)
detail is still relevant to you means (48:01 - 48:04)
that this Pokemon is still relevant to (48:03 - 48:05)
the list the fact that that detail is (48:04 - 48:07)
still relevant to me you is because I'm (48:05 - 48:09)
the only person here that watches the (48:07 - 48:12)
cartoon every week and that is (48:09 - 48:14)
compounded in my brain because i' see (48:12 - 48:17)
froi and his Evolution every week you (48:14 - 48:19)
know because the company chose him to be (48:17 - 48:22)
Ash's best buddy whatever let me let me (48:19 - 48:25)
step in between you two real quick here (48:22 - 48:28)
will you do watch the anime A Lot what (48:25 - 48:30)
what kind of charact I and I want I want (48:28 - 48:32)
I just want to see where my alliance (48:30 - 48:33)
goes between the two what kind of (48:32 - 48:36)
character was Froakie in the anime was (48:33 - 48:39)
was he like a side duck is he like a (48:36 - 48:42)
Charizard I'm just referencing Ash's (48:39 - 48:44)
strongest Pokemon personality types like (48:42 - 48:47)
or misties where does like where does he (48:44 - 48:50)
fit is he clumsy is he no no no just so (48:47 - 48:53)
you can understand the path of the (48:50 - 48:56)
croaky arc in the cartoon he is (48:53 - 49:01)
literally a Pokemon that um Professor (48:56 - 49:05)
Sycamore gave to numerous people as (49:01 - 49:08)
their starter Pokemon and then he was (49:05 - 49:12)
like oh you're not good enough for me so (49:08 - 49:14)
I'm leaving I'm walking away from my (49:12 - 49:16)
trainer and I'm going to go back to (49:14 - 49:18)
Professor Sycamore and then finally like (49:16 - 49:20)
ash is the one that he was like oh I (49:18 - 49:22)
guess you'll be cool and you can be my (49:20 - 49:24)
trainer because of course you're the (49:22 - 49:28)
chosen one whatever um so he's kind of (49:24 - 49:29)
not nice he's kind of like a really (49:28 - 49:32)
condensed Pikachu story aric so it (49:29 - 49:34)
sounds like it so it sounds like it does (49:32 - 49:35)
have an interesting Arc to it in that (49:34 - 49:37)
this is a Pokemon that started out (49:35 - 49:41)
stubborn and had to be um taught how to (49:37 - 49:45)
Love by by meeting uh Ace human being he (49:41 - 49:47)
didn't have to he just decided because (49:45 - 49:50)
he saw Ash's actions but he was mean to (49:47 - 49:52)
all those previous children who didn't (49:50 - 49:53)
live up to his standards because you (49:52 - 49:55)
know he learned from but then he learned (49:53 - 49:58)
from Ash Ash's enthusiasm his ability to (49:55 - 50:01)
execute what he wants and his uh (49:58 - 50:04)
constant cheerfulness that um that some (50:01 - 50:06)
people aren't bad so it's an interesting (50:04 - 50:08)
character AR and what that tells me wait (50:06 - 50:10)
wait wait wait wait and caki is so (50:08 - 50:13)
fantastic that he's like one of the (50:10 - 50:15)
three of Ash's Pokemon that was ever (50:13 - 50:17)
allowed to fully evolve to its final (50:15 - 50:20)
form yeah that's how great croi is (50:17 - 50:22)
you're argu sounds like the charm he (50:20 - 50:23)
sounds like Charmander yeah I'm I'm I'm (50:22 - 50:24)
arguing for (50:23 - 50:26)
Greninja (50:24 - 50:28)
I mean what you're telling me is that (50:26 - 50:32)
Froakie had enough insight to realize (50:28 - 50:33)
how terrible all those other children (50:32 - 50:36)
were we can't argue this much for each (50:33 - 50:40)
for each one where uh Micah and Steve (50:36 - 50:42)
where do you stand I can see him staying (50:40 - 50:45)
on the list for now I'm on either side (50:42 - 50:47)
of the fence honestly I have there's at (50:45 - 50:48)
least there's at least one person (50:47 - 50:51)
defending me so he only gets an italic (50:48 - 50:52)
all right he's italicize he's still on (50:51 - 50:55)
the list our only cut is low Tad Travis (50:52 - 50:57)
who are you you uh cutting who are you (50:55 - 50:58)
nominating this might not be a fan (50:57 - 51:00)
favorite call out um but I'm going to (50:58 - 51:04)
call for a strike on Eevee the reason (51:00 - 51:07)
here Eevee is a cute Pokemon sure the (51:04 - 51:10)
reason we like Eevee though is not (51:07 - 51:12)
because of what Eevee is but it's (51:10 - 51:14)
because of what Eevee has the potential (51:12 - 51:18)
to be Eevee in and of itself is nothing (51:14 - 51:20)
right so when we isolate Eevee from its (51:18 - 51:21)
evolutions and we're trying to pick a (51:20 - 51:23)
Pokemon that fits on a top 10 list Eevee (51:21 - 51:25)
doesn't make sense because Eevee is only (51:23 - 51:27)
interesting because you as the owner of (51:25 - 51:29)
Eevee have the choice to turn it into (51:27 - 51:32)
what is it that are there 10 now utions (51:29 - 51:34)
so when we're talking (51:32 - 51:37)
about yeah I was just gonna say so the (51:34 - 51:40)
interesting thing about Eevee is that it (51:37 - 51:42)
is part of this larger system that is (51:40 - 51:45)
the eveve lution system and when we're (51:42 - 51:46)
just talking about finding the best (51:45 - 51:49)
Pokemon taking one part of that system (51:46 - 51:53)
out and and saying it is the best uh (51:49 - 51:54)
separates it from what actually makes it (51:53 - 51:56)
interesting and it's no longer are (51:54 - 51:58)
interesting I would argue not only for (51:56 - 52:01)
Eevee to stay on this list but also in (51:58 - 52:05)
favor of Eevee being a starter Pokemon (52:01 - 52:08)
that that's what makes it so great (52:05 - 52:11)
because it's essentially the epitome of (52:08 - 52:14)
new beginnings which is when you're (52:11 - 52:16)
starting your Pokemon Journey that's (52:14 - 52:18)
exactly what you're looking for that's (52:16 - 52:21)
the epitome of the Pokemon Journey there (52:18 - 52:23)
are many paths in front of you with an (52:21 - 52:25)
Eevee and you get to choose your own and (52:23 - 52:27)
that's the whole point of the series and (52:25 - 52:29)
I think that's what makes Eevee so great (52:27 - 52:32)
and I would argue that Boop Eevee needs (52:29 - 52:34)
to go if you had put Umbreon you'd have (52:32 - 52:37)
my vote but Eevee no bueno but that's (52:34 - 52:40)
what's about Eevee is that we can all (52:37 - 52:42)
make our own decisions about what we (52:40 - 52:45)
want our Eevees to be in addition to (52:42 - 52:49)
that is just adorable eeve is adorable (52:45 - 52:52)
yeah but Eevee no one none of us want (52:49 - 52:55)
Eevee we want a specific Eevee evolution (52:52 - 52:57)
my point EX exactly and this is a list (52:55 - 52:58)
of people who have made decisions not (52:57 - 53:00)
people who are anticipating future (52:58 - 53:03)
decisions to be made but the only way (53:00 - 53:05)
that you can get that future Pokemon is (53:03 - 53:08)
with an Eevee and the only way that you (53:05 - 53:11)
can end your Pokemon journey is by (53:08 - 53:14)
beginning it look if read I've read too (53:11 - 53:16)
much St Thomas aquinus to have any (53:14 - 53:17)
respect for (53:16 - 53:19)
potentiality and uh I think we've got (53:17 - 53:21)
enough votes against Eevee to put that (53:19 - 53:23)
big old slash through the E the E the V (53:21 - 53:26)
the E and the e i I mean if this was buz (53:23 - 53:28)
a buzzfeed list it would be Charizard (53:26 - 53:32)
rapid Dash ditto Eevee Etc because they (53:28 - 53:33)
would use the argument that Eevee could (53:32 - 53:36)
be anything you want and I think that's (53:33 - 53:39)
cool but I also have a list of a lot of (53:36 - 53:41)
like I have esper I have lotad I have (53:39 - 53:43)
Ducket I have Pokemon that don't evolve (53:41 - 53:45)
and like in duckett's case Ducket is a (53:43 - 53:47)
Pokemon I do not want to evolve because (53:45 - 53:49)
it is dramatically different and I like (53:47 - 53:52)
that but but that that's what makes (53:49 - 53:53)
Ducket more special to me when I look at (53:52 - 53:56)
Eevee it's when can I get Eevee to (53:53 - 53:57)
evolve and what can I get Eevee to (53:56 - 54:00)
involve into it's it's just what Travis (53:57 - 54:02)
said it's just and what BuzzFeed would (54:00 - 54:03)
say look at everything Eevee could (54:02 - 54:05)
evolve into because you don't want it (54:03 - 54:07)
and you know what Eevee can't evolve (54:05 - 54:09)
into a ghost type so it can't evolve (54:07 - 54:12)
into what I want it to evolve into if (54:09 - 54:14)
you look at my list literally half of (54:12 - 54:16)
them are ghost Pokemon and yet Eevee is (54:14 - 54:19)
not so well it is now cuz that's three (54:16 - 54:22)
verse one on cutting looks like my Eevee (54:19 - 54:26)
evolved into a coup thanks guys who can (54:22 - 54:27)
we just get rid of all of Micah's (54:26 - 54:30)
Pokemon who who made that cut was that (54:27 - 54:33)
Travis nominated Eevee yes (54:30 - 54:38)
okay this list is rough I am going to (54:33 - 54:41)
opt to cut (54:38 - 54:45)
Reuniclus what I I think re Reuniclus is (54:41 - 54:48)
a cool Pokemon the design is outstanding (54:45 - 54:51)
it's really cool to me it strikes me a (54:48 - 54:54)
lot it it's too similar this is my (54:51 - 54:55)
complaint it's too similar ilar to (54:54 - 54:58)
Alakazam where and I could be wrong I'm (54:55 - 55:00)
not the biggest competitive battler but (54:58 - 55:02)
it it strikes me as a glass Cannon could (55:00 - 55:04)
be wrong that hurts me so much it's (55:02 - 55:06)
incorrect Reuniclus is bulky is it super (55:04 - 55:09)
bulky that's why it's got that coding (55:06 - 55:11)
around it yeah I thought you had to (55:09 - 55:13)
breed it specifically for that nah like (55:11 - 55:15)
you had to breed it more specifically to (55:13 - 55:18)
be bulky let me pull up its base stats (55:15 - 55:22)
uh just we'll get the can we (55:18 - 55:25)
compare can we compare it to alexam real (55:22 - 55:26)
quick (55:25 - 55:28)
110 HP (55:26 - 55:33)
125 special attack uh sorry 110 HP 75 (55:28 - 55:35)
defense 85 special defense so not as (55:33 - 55:37)
bulky as I thought but the 110 HP is a (55:35 - 55:39)
lot of bulk compared to an I'll Alakazam (55:37 - 55:41)
in a second feel like alakazam's in the (55:39 - 55:43)
70 and 80s to for defenses but as Travis (55:41 - 55:46)
is looking that up when you I was super (55:43 - 55:48)
actually surprised you added reun to the (55:46 - 55:51)
list not that well I like really unicist (55:48 - 55:52)
not enough for my top 10 but I've never (55:51 - 55:56)
heard you talk about really unicist or (55:52 - 55:58)
is on every one of my playthroughs ever (55:56 - 56:01)
since Reuniclus came out I guess out of (55:58 - 56:02)
all out of all the Pokemon you were (56:01 - 56:05)
vocal about Reuniclus is the one you are (56:02 - 56:08)
least vocal about on the list and your (56:05 - 56:11)
our list can't be your top 10 Pokemon so (56:08 - 56:12)
it could be if you would stop going (56:11 - 56:14)
after my Pokemon could it could be but I (56:12 - 56:17)
think you would agree out of your 10 (56:14 - 56:19)
Reuniclus is the is probably the lowest (56:17 - 56:22)
on your list or at least to me the one (56:19 - 56:25)
you rarely mention and you mention a (56:22 - 56:27)
couple of these Pokemon quite frequently (56:25 - 56:28)
if that is your (56:27 - 56:31)
Criterion I would agree with you there (56:28 - 56:33)
Alakazam and runic share the same (56:31 - 56:38)
special defense um but Alakazam only has (56:33 - 56:42)
uh 55 HP to reun is 110 and and reic has (56:38 - 56:44)
more defense as well if that's the only (56:42 - 56:46)
of the arguments I would side with Will (56:44 - 56:50)
here the you know Steve you list that (56:46 - 56:52)
the design is great and I agree um you (56:50 - 56:54)
list that it's a cool Pokemon and I (56:52 - 56:55)
agree if if you're only only real (56:54 - 56:58)
argument is that it's not talked about (56:55 - 57:00)
that often or will specifically doesn't (56:58 - 57:01)
talk about it that often I don't find (57:00 - 57:04)
that argument particular particularly (57:01 - 57:05)
compelling for why it should be taken (57:04 - 57:07)
off the list especially since I think (57:05 - 57:09)
all of us agree uh that the design is (57:07 - 57:11)
great and the um evolutionary line it's (57:09 - 57:14)
a part of is is a cool design as well I (57:11 - 57:16)
agree it's a cool design but that (57:14 - 57:18)
doesn't I think all the Pok are cool (57:16 - 57:20)
wait wait wait for you for your gen five (57:18 - 57:22)
psychic type do you want Reuniclus or do (57:20 - 57:24)
you want gothorita Reuniclus is better (57:22 - 57:27)
but like all these Pokemon are good like (57:24 - 57:29)
I could I could speak to how they all (57:27 - 57:32)
are designed I'm sorry I I couldn't hear (57:29 - 57:34)
anything after you just said Reuniclus (57:32 - 57:36)
is better okay absolutely like Reuniclus (57:34 - 57:38)
vot of confidence thank you then (57:36 - 57:41)
gothorita but that's not saying anything (57:38 - 57:43)
right that's like saying what do you (57:41 - 57:44)
want Reuniclus or huntail like (57:43 - 57:46)
everyone's going to pick Reuniclus no (57:44 - 57:48)
one's going to pick huntail I mean what (57:46 - 57:49)
would you rather have this ice cream (57:48 - 57:52)
cone full of trash or this ice cream (57:49 - 57:56)
cone full of uh a pile of Flesh all I (57:52 - 57:57)
heard just now was everyone's going to (57:56 - 57:59)
pick Ray unicas so I just keep getting (57:57 - 58:01)
these votes in my favor I don't even (57:59 - 58:03)
understand what this debate think that (58:01 - 58:05)
Reuniclus and its its line are (58:03 - 58:08)
interesting designs I do not consider it (58:05 - 58:11)
to be anywhere near notable enough to (58:08 - 58:14)
place it on a top 10 list of all the (58:11 - 58:16)
Poke available Pokemon especially in (58:14 - 58:18)
comparison to a lot of the stuff on this (58:16 - 58:20)
list technically it's a top 10 list of (58:18 - 58:23)
these 40 that's true but these 40 were (58:20 - 58:26)
already pre-cut prior to this I can see (58:23 - 58:28)
Travis's argument with Froakie I (58:26 - 58:30)
understand how important Froakie is to (58:28 - 58:32)
Travis if you want to like you can't (58:30 - 58:35)
live and die on every single Pokemon (58:32 - 58:38)
your on your list oh yes I can yeah but (58:35 - 58:40)
we we would be here for a long long time (58:38 - 58:41)
and I don't want to be here that long (58:40 - 58:44)
like I nothing better to do I enjoy I've (58:41 - 58:45)
enjoyed what we've talked about up to (58:44 - 58:48)
this point I could have lived and died (58:45 - 58:50)
on low Tad Travis will probably live and (58:48 - 58:53)
die on Froakie I picked re unicus (58:50 - 58:54)
because I feel it is the weakest on your (58:53 - 58:56)
list and if you want if you still want (58:54 - 58:59)
to stand by that okay we can italicize (58:56 - 59:02)
it but like I feel like you have better (58:59 - 59:04)
Arguments for other Pokemon on your list (59:02 - 59:08)
I think that Travis and I both have a (59:04 - 59:11)
good feeling towards Reuniclus and it (59:08 - 59:13)
needs to stay all right and you can just (59:11 - 59:15)
remove Froakie right now in its place (59:13 - 59:16)
thank (59:15 - 59:22)
you all right Micah you're go oh (59:16 - 59:25)
good uh (59:22 - 59:28)
I'm gonna go for I'm gonna go for honch (59:25 - 59:32)
Crow H the honch can take it the H can (59:28 - 59:35)
take it it's it's a neat looking Pokemon (59:32 - 59:38)
and I agree with your argument that the (59:35 - 59:42)
gangster the like 20s gangster style (59:38 - 59:45)
Pokemon needed to be represented in some (59:42 - 59:47)
fashion and honk is a great example of (59:45 - 59:50)
that however I don't think that there (59:47 - 59:52)
are any more redeeming qualities other (59:50 - 59:55)
than what it's Loosely based on (59:52 - 59:59)
and I would I would go in uh before (59:55 - 60:02)
Travis gets a chance to defend um in the (59:59 - 60:04)
realm of this type of Pokemon I'd rather (60:02 - 60:07)
go with a Mis Maus than a honchkrow not (60:04 - 60:09)
even the whole list no I know that's (60:07 - 60:12)
what I'm saying a Pokemon that's notely (60:09 - 60:14)
speaking yes is is even better than this (60:12 - 60:17)
one okay so I in in (60:14 - 60:21)
defense in defense of honchkrow I will (60:17 - 60:23)
you know maintain what you've already (60:21 - 60:25)
conceded that um (60:23 - 60:29)
that its design and and basis are great (60:25 - 60:32)
um I'll concede also that its design is (60:29 - 60:34)
cool as you say but I'll also add you (60:32 - 60:36)
say your your main argument then is that (60:34 - 60:39)
um Beyond its coolness there's not a lot (60:36 - 60:41)
uh for honra to go on and I'll present (60:39 - 60:45)
uh just one I think honro adds a lot to (60:41 - 60:47)
our understanding of the dark type at (60:45 - 60:49)
least in the west because uh in in (60:47 - 60:52)
Japanese the dark type translates it (60:49 - 60:54)
like it the the translation of dark type (60:52 - 60:55)
to English as far as I understand from (60:54 - 60:58)
what I understand in Japan the dark type (60:55 - 61:00)
has more connotations of like trickery (60:58 - 61:03)
or um Mischief at least that's my (61:00 - 61:05)
understanding of it um and I feel like (61:03 - 61:07)
honro is one of the Pokemon and I feel (61:05 - 61:09)
like that gets translated to us I think (61:07 - 61:12)
I think we get that between weile as (61:09 - 61:15)
another example but I think honro even (61:12 - 61:17)
more shows that that dark doesn't (61:15 - 61:18)
necessarily mean evil which I think (61:17 - 61:20)
weile can kind of show in a lot of the (61:18 - 61:22)
other dark type Pokemon you would just (61:20 - 61:24)
assume that there's more complexity to (61:22 - 61:26)
the dark type that it means more things (61:24 - 61:29)
and because honro is only a dark type (61:26 - 61:31)
Pokemon because it's based on a it's (61:29 - 61:33)
based on crime and it's based on on that (61:31 - 61:35)
crime culture that it that it shows us a (61:33 - 61:38)
lot more it makes the dark Ty its (61:35 - 61:40)
presence makes the dark type more (61:38 - 61:43)
interesting that's a fantastic argument (61:40 - 61:46)
but it it doesn't help me feel better (61:43 - 61:49)
about how trash honk is that's fine (61:46 - 61:50)
strike (61:49 - 61:52)
it I mean if you that was a really great (61:50 - 61:54)
argument yeah yeah it was a super good (61:52 - 61:56)
argument it was better than Reuniclus is (61:54 - 61:57)
argument but there are a lot of dark (61:56 - 62:00)
type Pokemon I feel like that still do (61:57 - 62:02)
communicate that without honchkrow being (62:00 - 62:04)
like the crutch that they all stand on (62:02 - 62:06)
hey I had to do (62:04 - 62:08)
something I had to say something I mean (62:06 - 62:10)
no you're you're it's pretty great for (62:08 - 62:12)
like off the cuff if you didn't say (62:10 - 62:15)
earlier that a honchkrow is your number (62:12 - 62:17)
10 and would probably be cut earlier I (62:15 - 62:20)
wouldn't have like struck out HC right (62:17 - 62:22)
now but like your argument was good well (62:20 - 62:25)
thank you will who are you picking oh I (62:22 - 62:27)
got to pick again (62:25 - 62:29)
um (62:27 - 62:33)
boy this is a tough choice cuz they a (62:29 - 62:36)
lot of good Pokemon on (62:33 - 62:36)
here I think well I don't want to be too (62:37 - 62:45)
harmful um I think vanill is incredibly (62:41 - 62:49)
idiosyncratic to Travis's enjoyment of (62:45 - 62:52)
ice types and I think if you have to (62:49 - 62:55)
pick one ice type from this list curum (62:52 - 62:57)
is obviously the superior (62:55 - 63:00)
choice so I I just think I can (62:57 - 63:03)
understand that you know Travis enjoys (63:00 - 63:04)
Velux and even you know in my (63:03 - 63:08)
playthrough of uh Pokemon Y I bought the (63:04 - 63:10)
vanillite shirt for my character so that (63:08 - 63:11)
he could wear that around and I thought (63:10 - 63:15)
that was cute but cute does not win (63:11 - 63:17)
battles and uh and and actually you know (63:15 - 63:19)
I do have a fondness for for vanilla as (63:17 - 63:22)
well because if the uh the Pokemon (63:19 - 63:24)
podcast playmat that I still use when I (63:22 - 63:25)
play TCG (63:24 - 63:28)
but that still ain't going to do it got (63:25 - 63:31)
to go you just activated my trap (63:28 - 63:34)
card before Tris I feel like this is the (63:31 - 63:36)
really first the first really personal (63:34 - 63:39)
Thro gra before Travis defends I will (63:36 - 63:43)
say that I can see vanilla being a final (63:39 - 63:45)
top 10 out of all these Pokemon and (63:43 - 63:48)
that's just me really yes I have two I (63:45 - 63:51)
have two main defenses for vanillo first (63:48 - 63:53)
vanillo is great because it's an it's (63:51 - 63:55)
one of I believe (63:53 - 63:58)
seven or or or 10 or something um if (63:55 - 64:01)
you're counting different Pokemon within (63:58 - 64:03)
the same uh evolutionary line I think (64:01 - 64:07)
it's 10 uh Pokemon designed by Oh shoot (64:03 - 64:08)
what was his name I don't remember his (64:07 - 64:10)
name uh but he's the first Western he's (64:08 - 64:12)
a he's a British fellow uh the first (64:10 - 64:15)
Westerner to design uh to to do the (64:12 - 64:19)
official design for Pokemon um all all (64:15 - 64:21)
of those were in all of his first work (64:19 - 64:23)
and the first work of westerners were in (64:21 - 64:26)
gen five uh his other work was like uh (64:23 - 64:28)
Garbodor which is also on this list and (64:26 - 64:31)
I feel like uh because of that vanilla (64:28 - 64:37)
represents um the Pokemon's move towards (64:31 - 64:38)
it where it is now with a sort of (64:37 - 64:41)
international Focus um it I think that (64:38 - 64:43)
culminated in Gen 6 with the different (64:41 - 64:47)
languages with uh vivalon or vivon um (64:43 - 64:49)
the different forms of vivon depending (64:47 - 64:51)
on region and I think vanilla is where (64:49 - 64:53)
that starts because you get designs from (64:51 - 64:57)
westerners and um because it it opens up (64:53 - 65:01)
the design space to uh to ideas from (64:57 - 65:03)
other cultures whether or not you can I (65:01 - 65:05)
don't you know myself I don't know the (65:03 - 65:07)
origins of ice cream um but I feel like (65:05 - 65:09)
vanilla is part of a larger group of (65:07 - 65:12)
Pokemon um that opens up the design (65:09 - 65:14)
space to not just Japanese culture (65:12 - 65:16)
things like the beckoning lucky cat but (65:14 - 65:19)
also um cultural ideas from uh from all (65:16 - 65:22)
across the globe for people who live in (65:19 - 65:24)
those cultures to be able to have their (65:22 - 65:27)
own Pokemon represented in them the (65:24 - 65:28)
second defense and I think is the (65:27 - 65:30)
stronger defense as if the first one (65:28 - 65:32)
wasn't already good enough already uh is (65:30 - 65:37)
that vilu represents everything that (65:32 - 65:41)
that is good that we defend from the you (65:37 - 65:44)
know the the Gen warer criticism right (65:41 - 65:47)
the Gen oners say that after gen one um (65:44 - 65:51)
Pokemon had no good ideas anymore that (65:47 - 65:54)
that after gen one Pokemon are just (65:51 - 65:56)
based on they're not based on animals (65:54 - 65:58)
anymore so vanilla flies in the face of (65:56 - 66:01)
that by doing just that it's not based (65:58 - 66:03)
on an animal um it's based on a (66:01 - 66:05)
completely different kind of object it's (66:03 - 66:07)
it's bold in the fact that it is a food (66:05 - 66:11)
Pokemon uh and it's also a cheerful um (66:07 - 66:13)
happy beautiful beautifully designed I (66:11 - 66:16)
think Pokemon that says you know I don't (66:13 - 66:19)
I don't care if your argument is that uh (66:16 - 66:21)
gen one was better because everything (66:19 - 66:25)
was uh darker or scarier Villa (66:21 - 66:27)
represents the move towards aiming it (66:25 - 66:30)
says this game is for children vanilla (66:27 - 66:32)
is a Pokemon that kids would love it's (66:30 - 66:34)
happy it's smiling it's got the whole (66:32 - 66:36)
weird two- fa thing that's a little (66:34 - 66:38)
interesting so I feel like villax is one (66:36 - 66:40)
of the Pokemon that's not necessarily (66:38 - 66:42)
for people our AG vanilla is one of the (66:40 - 66:46)
Pokemon uh wherein game freak is saying (66:42 - 66:50)
this is for kids the the sort of harsh (66:46 - 66:52)
critics of of gen one aren't the target (66:50 - 66:53)
audience and you shouldn't be entitled (66:52 - 66:55)
to think so I think that's also what (66:53 - 66:57)
venox represents that was my first (66:55 - 67:00)
immediate thought when thinking about (66:57 - 67:02)
whether or not to support or defend (67:00 - 67:05)
velix is that that argument specifically (67:02 - 67:08)
and I think it was either on Twitter or (67:05 - 67:12)
in an episode of the podcast when they (67:08 - 67:15)
had announced Velux or whatever it was (67:12 - 67:18)
you I I saw or I listened to or read you (67:15 - 67:22)
arguing that point and it was a really (67:18 - 67:25)
good point to me not just because is it (67:22 - 67:28)
flies in the face of on its own what PE (67:25 - 67:31)
what gen oners say about Pokemon past (67:28 - 67:34)
gen one but also because it draws a lot (67:31 - 67:37)
of attention to the fact that gen one a (67:34 - 67:39)
lot of it was exactly what they were (67:37 - 67:42)
arguing the rest of the series is about (67:39 - 67:44)
and what the designs come from because (67:42 - 67:47)
if you look at gen one a lot of it is (67:44 - 67:50)
exactly that it's just it's like J Dude (67:47 - 67:53)
is a rock with arms and I mean there's (67:50 - 67:54)
plenty of Pokemon in general one that (67:53 - 67:58)
are literally just things that they gave (67:54 - 68:01)
some kind of character to and then it (67:58 - 68:03)
was a Pokemon and I think that vanilla (68:01 - 68:06)
did a really good job of presenting that (68:03 - 68:09)
argument and also kind of shutting it (68:06 - 68:11)
down I mean I I don't know what will has (68:09 - 68:12)
to say because he was the one that (68:11 - 68:14)
nominated this but I would be willing to (68:12 - 68:17)
bold vanilla right now and move that (68:14 - 68:20)
Pokemon into the top the final top 10 (68:17 - 68:22)
you guys have so completely bored me to (68:20 - 68:25)
death with your argumentation I'm (68:22 - 68:28)
whatever it's a it's a very it's very (68:25 - 68:31)
close to Travis this is important I mean (68:28 - 68:33)
if vilux is down there on the top 10 (68:31 - 68:35)
don't expect me to sign this declaration (68:33 - 68:38)
of independence I mean I mean look we we (68:35 - 68:41)
have spent 31 minutes arguing five (68:38 - 68:44)
Pokemon so like you have to make (68:41 - 68:46)
sacrifices to make this list work if (68:44 - 68:48)
you're going to defend like I took I I (68:46 - 68:51)
cross out lotad pretty quickly and just (68:48 - 68:53)
just make it clear right it's on the (68:51 - 68:55)
record that I did not support vanilla (68:53 - 68:56)
but three dudes (68:55 - 68:58)
did there are going to be plenty of (68:56 - 69:00)
Pokemon on the final list that I don't (68:58 - 69:03)
care about right like yeah if you look (69:00 - 69:05)
at the progress bar on your podcast (69:03 - 69:08)
listening app it probably says that (69:05 - 69:11)
we're only a third of the way no one one (69:08 - 69:13)
quarter one I mean I'm I'm looking at my (69:11 - 69:16)
list and I'm looking at like I'm looking (69:13 - 69:19)
at three I'm looking at two to three (69:16 - 69:21)
that I want to make sure gets to that (69:19 - 69:23)
list and I look at other people's lists (69:21 - 69:25)
and I and I look at vanilla and I go (69:23 - 69:29)
vanilla is a Pokemon that I 100% support (69:25 - 69:31)
to go on that final list my my argument (69:29 - 69:35)
with re earlier is like I think you will (69:31 - 69:36)
should be looking at two to three (69:35 - 69:40)
Pokemon that you think that you will hey (69:36 - 69:42)
hey hey hey hey I I'm just saying this (69:40 - 69:45)
is not your board game buddy don't tell (69:42 - 69:48)
me my strategy I know how I I know my (69:45 - 69:50)
win condition you don't have to tell me (69:48 - 69:52)
how I'm going to win I'm need to save (69:50 - 69:54)
some of this intensity for Gen Con you (69:52 - 69:56)
you can save all of your justifications (69:54 - 69:59)
move the villu down I've issued my (69:56 - 70:01)
protest my black card is on the table we (69:59 - 70:03)
can move forward vanilla can I make it (70:01 - 70:06)
can I make a challenge it is my turn (70:03 - 70:09)
right uh it is it is your turn yes at at (70:06 - 70:11)
the risk of uh Fanning the Flames even (70:09 - 70:15)
more I'm going to challenge kierum [ __ ] (70:11 - 70:16)
oh (70:15 - 70:19)
boy wait a minute I would argue that (70:16 - 70:22)
kierum is the U Mirror Image to what (70:19 - 70:26)
makes vanilla great because kierum while (70:22 - 70:31)
vanilla is uh evidence against gen wers (70:26 - 70:34)
right kierum said or sorry vanilla says (70:31 - 70:36)
we can make great Pokemon that aren't (70:34 - 70:39)
based on animals it says we can make (70:36 - 70:41)
great Pokemon and aren't in gen one I (70:39 - 70:44)
think kurum represents some of the valid (70:41 - 70:46)
validity within gen one argumentation (70:44 - 70:49)
namely uh that as the games went on (70:46 - 70:50)
Pokemon got too complicated that that's (70:49 - 70:53)
an argument that I uh that I buy I think (70:50 - 70:55)
it makes it worse for kids the main (70:53 - 70:56)
target audience the fact that you (70:55 - 70:59)
combine these these two Pokemon with a (70:56 - 71:02)
DNA splicer and you end up with uh two (70:59 - 71:04)
different forms of kierum or three if (71:02 - 71:06)
you count its base form that doesn't (71:04 - 71:10)
feel like uh the spirit of of the game (71:06 - 71:11)
that feels like a that feels like a (71:10 - 71:13)
different franchise altogether uh kurum (71:11 - 71:16)
additionally I feel like is is not even (71:13 - 71:17)
the best of it it's I would argue is the (71:16 - 71:20)
worst of its Trio I think I think raram (71:17 - 71:22)
and zum have a sort of um Majesty to (71:20 - 71:24)
them a sort of Elegance to them the [ __ ] (71:22 - 71:27)
completely lacks partially I would I (71:24 - 71:28)
would suppose because it's it's it's (71:27 - 71:30)
literally supposed to be a husk um but I (71:28 - 71:32)
think that's even more evidence that (71:30 - 71:35)
this Pokemon is uninspired incorrect (71:32 - 71:38)
curum is a strange and beautiful (71:35 - 71:41)
creature there was once a unified dragon (71:38 - 71:43)
that crashed to Earth and in the (71:41 - 71:46)
crashing split into two creatures curum (71:43 - 71:49)
is the void The Emptiness between the (71:46 - 71:52)
husk that's left over the not the (71:49 - 71:55)
external shell but the in yeah I wasn't (71:52 - 71:58)
saying husk literally I understand (71:55 - 72:00)
strangely that's the word you used which (71:58 - 72:04)
was husk and [ __ ] represents void The (72:00 - 72:07)
Emptiness and what is a husk empty void (72:04 - 72:11)
no husk how I know how the Pokemon works (72:07 - 72:14)
I think the story of kierum is beautiful (72:11 - 72:17)
it is intriguing it is unresolved and it (72:14 - 72:19)
just presents a mystery in the Pokemon (72:17 - 72:21)
Universe that you know still has not (72:19 - 72:24)
been uh answered probably never will be (72:21 - 72:26)
and it's something to ponder and and (72:24 - 72:29)
think about and and is wonderful for the (72:26 - 72:30)
sake of time I'll just let my argents (72:29 - 72:32)
speak forsel my opinion on kierum is (72:30 - 72:36)
that I initially was very against it (72:32 - 72:39)
because I black and white and black two (72:36 - 72:41)
and white two are easily my least (72:39 - 72:44)
favorite of the series I agree however I (72:41 - 72:47)
do really I I didn't know enough about (72:44 - 72:50)
kierum and I still don't because I never (72:47 - 72:53)
completed black two and white two and I (72:50 - 72:55)
do actually really like that story (72:53 - 72:57)
however that's not enough for me to (72:55 - 73:00)
argue for it so I'm kind of on like a I (72:57 - 73:02)
can't say one way or another kierum is (73:00 - 73:04)
really cool because it's asymmetrical (73:02 - 73:07)
it's not a uniform Pokemon like others (73:04 - 73:10)
but even kierum could not save my (73:07 - 73:15)
boredom that was black and white too (73:10 - 73:18)
oh and I think that's three verse one (73:15 - 73:21)
against kierum which is two two and a (73:18 - 73:23)
half but whatever and a sit out and an (73:21 - 73:25)
abstain (73:23 - 73:27)
you can't abstain from everything Micah (73:25 - 73:29)
if I got no opinion on it one way or (73:27 - 73:31)
another that's well he doesn't even (73:29 - 73:32)
understand the story of [ __ ] so he's (73:31 - 73:35)
uneducated vote I'd rather not even have (73:32 - 73:37)
give him the slice slice it out we're (73:35 - 73:39)
cutting I said that I thought it was (73:37 - 73:41)
interesting I like it I like your (73:39 - 73:43)
version of the story and it actually me (73:41 - 73:44)
interested to learn more about it cut (73:43 - 73:46)
give it the cut he doesn't know enough I (73:44 - 73:49)
don't want an uninformed voter making (73:46 - 73:51)
decisions for our (73:49 - 73:53)
populace all right Travis you voted for (73:51 - 73:57)
procure him right correct I will I'm I'm (73:53 - 74:00)
not meaning to attack you Micah but it's (73:57 - 74:04)
fine come at me cby really sucks oh my (74:00 - 74:06)
God I'm gonna say right now you have to (74:04 - 74:07)
have a very good argument because I love (74:06 - 74:11)
celby oh my God all right celby has (74:07 - 74:15)
first off one of the weakest movies out (74:11 - 74:17)
of the 200 plus Pokemon movies that (74:15 - 74:19)
exist I will agree with that right off (74:17 - 74:22)
the bat before you continue and I had (74:19 - 74:26)
not seen it until this last last summer (74:22 - 74:28)
or whenever it was that they did the uh (74:26 - 74:29)
twitch watches Pokemon and they aired (74:28 - 74:32)
like a bunch of movies and it was really (74:29 - 74:34)
difficult for me to sit through that (74:32 - 74:37)
however I have pretty much no knowledge (74:34 - 74:41)
of the show Beyond Kanto and so that did (74:37 - 74:43)
not factor into my argument for celby at (74:41 - 74:46)
all all right all right we have three (74:43 - 74:48)
mythical Pokemon on this list we have (74:46 - 74:50)
Gerra we have Victini we have celby (74:48 - 74:53)
we're only missing Mew and manife and (74:50 - 74:56)
and those four Pokemon are all better (74:53 - 75:00)
than celby in every way and and how (74:56 - 75:03)
because I disagree like it give me it (75:00 - 75:05)
like other than the movie is bad tell me (75:03 - 75:08)
why celby isn't good like celby is okay (75:05 - 75:10)
celab is the time travel Pokemon it can (75:08 - 75:13)
go back and forth through time we've (75:10 - 75:16)
seen that that is not that is its unique (75:13 - 75:18)
ability but we also see that other (75:16 - 75:20)
Pokemon have the ability to do that (75:18 - 75:24)
gutina palia Daga daaga can never say (75:20 - 75:26)
that dragon's name but you know what I'm (75:24 - 75:28)
talking about they all have the (75:26 - 75:30)
abilities to go through time in some (75:28 - 75:33)
extent maybe not as quickly as celby but (75:30 - 75:36)
they all have time travel like Victini (75:33 - 75:39)
has however how well Victini however (75:36 - 75:42)
though has a lot (75:39 - 75:45)
going celby has the ability to not only (75:42 - 75:49)
time travel but to exist at any given (75:45 - 75:51)
point in time that it travels to (75:49 - 75:54)
therefore celby is literally its own (75:51 - 75:57)
time Paradox which is amazing to me (75:54 - 75:59)
because it takes this Pokemon that's (75:57 - 76:00)
cute and adorable and it's supposed to (75:59 - 76:03)
be uh something that kids just are (76:00 - 76:06)
really excited about and then it has (76:03 - 76:09)
this way deeper story that lets adults (76:06 - 76:12)
enjoy it just as much but would you like (76:09 - 76:14)
if you were in the Pokemon Universe and (76:12 - 76:16)
you this is this argument's getting real (76:14 - 76:19)
weird and you see a celby the celby can (76:16 - 76:21)
do the time Paradox thing is that (76:19 - 76:23)
exciting to you knowing it can do its (76:21 - 76:26)
own thing that probably will or will not (76:23 - 76:29)
involve you or when you see a Victini (76:26 - 76:31)
you know that a Victini brings both (76:29 - 76:34)
Victory and luck and that directly (76:31 - 76:36)
affects you now if you look at Gerra you (76:34 - 76:40)
know ger Geri grants wishes so if I was (76:36 - 76:42)
a little kid and Pokemon were real celab (76:40 - 76:44)
is the last mythical Pokemon I want to (76:42 - 76:47)
see because celby is selfish Victini (76:44 - 76:50)
were vitini and Gerra both work for the (76:47 - 76:53)
kids celby is far from selfish because (76:50 - 76:56)
C's main goal is to show up and bring (76:53 - 76:59)
peace and to revitalize the world for (76:56 - 77:01)
everyone yeah and you've seen every one (76:59 - 77:03)
of those Pokemon movies everything bad (77:01 - 77:06)
happens where's celby nowhere except the (77:03 - 77:09)
fourth movie and maybe another movie (77:06 - 77:12)
only shows up when peace is present it (77:09 - 77:15)
didn't save ash from crying in every (77:12 - 77:18)
single movie good I would argue that (77:15 - 77:20)
that's a benefit to (77:18 - 77:23)
Cel I think I'm I don't know I don't (77:20 - 77:24)
know where will stand but I think I'm (77:23 - 77:26)
okay with with striking it because of (77:24 - 77:29)
this this idea of comparing it to the (77:26 - 77:31)
other mythicals not in terms of its it's (77:29 - 77:33)
design I still would say that celby I (77:31 - 77:36)
think is the best designed uh visually I (77:33 - 77:37)
think it's the most aesthetically (77:36 - 77:40)
interesting of the uh mythicals but this (77:37 - 77:42)
argument that you know what makes the I (77:40 - 77:44)
don't think that the well it's I (77:42 - 77:46)
shouldn't say mythical because other (77:44 - 77:48)
Pokemon would qualify in that sense I (77:46 - 77:51)
think of the Mew analogues all of those (77:48 - 77:54)
are valued based on (77:51 - 77:55)
you know what's interesting about them (77:54 - 77:58)
is is what they can is what they bring (77:55 - 78:00)
with them they're sort of these strange (77:58 - 78:02)
uh Pixie like creatures that appear in (78:00 - 78:05)
and out of your existence and and and (78:02 - 78:08)
May and have like a profound effect when (78:05 - 78:11)
they get there and time travel is a sort (78:08 - 78:14)
of doesn't fit with that and thus is (78:11 - 78:16)
sort of the least successful in that (78:14 - 78:18)
endeavor so even though I like cobby I'm (78:16 - 78:20)
I'm not I (78:18 - 78:24)
will on on (78:20 - 78:27)
one specific thing that I immediately (78:24 - 78:30)
rebut by removing Gerra from the list (78:27 - 78:32)
wait wait wait before you do that we (78:30 - 78:34)
haven't had will like if if Will's not (78:32 - 78:36)
defending celby celab is just getting (78:34 - 78:40)
cut I enjoy celby as the forest guardian (78:36 - 78:44)
and certainly in the generation 2 games (78:40 - 78:47)
and the generation 4 games being a more (78:44 - 78:50)
accessible mythical Pokemon to (78:47 - 78:53)
understand as part of the game but (78:50 - 78:56)
not enough to keep him on the list gotta (78:53 - 78:59)
go that's three vers as much as I argued (78:56 - 79:02)
for it I am not heartbroken over celby I (78:59 - 79:05)
love celby but you make good points it (79:02 - 79:08)
is it is your vote though it is your (79:05 - 79:10)
choice for elimination and are you going (79:08 - 79:13)
straight for Gerra I am going straight (79:10 - 79:16)
for Gerra only because I find Gerra to (79:13 - 79:19)
be the least interesting of the mythical (79:16 - 79:22)
Pokemon I find it to be not only the (79:19 - 79:24)
least interesting but also the most (79:22 - 79:27)
cliche that it is a Pokemon that grants (79:24 - 79:29)
wishes (79:27 - 79:32)
can incredibly idealist and not (79:29 - 79:35)
reasonable and I hate it can we tag team (79:32 - 79:37)
on this go right ahead let's do yeah you (79:35 - 79:39)
can start Travis if you have ever played (79:37 - 79:41)
against a Gerra competitively you know (79:39 - 79:44)
that Gerra is the most annoying little (79:41 - 79:47)
piece of garbage that has ever been in (79:44 - 79:49)
any Pokemon game Serene Grace and Iron (79:47 - 79:53)
Head should not be allow let so it is it (79:49 - 79:56)
is somehow more annoying than Togekiss (79:53 - 79:57)
even though they have the exact same (79:56 - 80:01)
strategy the Thunder Wave Serene Grace (79:57 - 80:02)
Iron Head you're never going to get your (80:01 - 80:04)
move off because you're always going to (80:02 - 80:06)
Flinch in Thunder Wave Geri represents (80:04 - 80:08)
all the bad things about competitive (80:06 - 80:11)
Pokemon uh all of these luck based uh (80:08 - 80:13)
checks the you know the only thing worse (80:11 - 80:15)
was is is if it somehow got Critical (80:13 - 80:18)
Hits more it it represent so many of the (80:15 - 80:19)
things that are wrong with competitive (80:18 - 80:22)
Pokemon I couldn't I it would be very (80:19 - 80:23)
difficult for me to put it on on a top (80:22 - 80:26)
10 list when it when I uphor how it (80:23 - 80:27)
actually plays in the actual game which (80:26 - 80:30)
I would argue um is an important factor (80:27 - 80:33)
for for making a top 10 list like this I (80:30 - 80:35)
have no fondness one way or the other (80:33 - 80:37)
when it comes to dirra but I will (80:35 - 80:39)
mention that there are frequently (80:37 - 80:42)
special Gerra distributions in Japan to (80:39 - 80:45)
celebrate specific events because Gerra (80:42 - 80:47)
is very reflective of something in (80:45 - 80:50)
Japanese culture tied to meteor showers (80:47 - 80:53)
that we do not have in our English (80:50 - 80:56)
speaking culture um and it has been (80:53 - 80:58)
extremely difficult for people to get a (80:56 - 81:01)
Gerra in in you know especially newer (80:58 - 81:04)
players and therefore I find Gerra to be (81:01 - 81:07)
incredibly uninteresting and he can (81:04 - 81:09)
go when Travis said Steve hasn't given a (81:07 - 81:11)
defense let's tag team this he kind of (81:09 - 81:13)
just threw Gerra under the bus instead (81:11 - 81:16)
of like defending Gerra that's what I (81:13 - 81:17)
was saying I'm (81:16 - 81:21)
tag yeah with M oh I see I there are (81:17 - 81:24)
other Pokemon I would rather fight for (81:21 - 81:28)
but I think if in the Pokemon lure lure (81:24 - 81:31)
lore uh in the Pokemon lore I think (81:28 - 81:34)
Gerra really stands out as a Pokemon (81:31 - 81:37)
that you would actually want to see and (81:34 - 81:38)
experience there are a lot of I would (81:37 - 81:40)
want to see and experience literally (81:38 - 81:42)
every Pokemon I want every Pokemon to be (81:40 - 81:46)
real my dream would be actually if Gerra (81:42 - 81:47)
is pointless because my only wish that (81:46 - 81:49)
would ever matter to me is I wish (81:47 - 81:51)
Pokemon were real and if da were there (81:49 - 81:52)
it would kind of be pointless because my (81:51 - 81:54)
wishes already been granted and and you (81:52 - 81:56)
know what's unfortunate cuz I know this (81:54 - 81:57)
is going to fall on deaf ears in this (81:56 - 81:59)
particular crowd but if anybody has (81:57 - 82:03)
watched has watched uh Moka you would (81:59 - 82:05)
understand that Gerra is actually CU and (82:03 - 82:08)
is the villain of the story okay well (82:05 - 82:10)
let me I already said I'm cutting D let (82:08 - 82:13)
me just give some defense for this poor (82:10 - 82:16)
Pokemon that's about to get (82:13 - 82:21)
cut if if if Pokemon go was real if (82:16 - 82:23)
Pokemon was real in the lore if you can (82:21 - 82:26)
be around all these Pokemon and we bring (82:23 - 82:29)
that down to mythical and legendary (82:26 - 82:32)
Pokemon and you see something like a (82:29 - 82:35)
rasham or a zeram or a Raichu or an anti (82:32 - 82:39)
in the wild yes that is a that should be (82:35 - 82:42)
a rare and one in the in a lifetime (82:39 - 82:44)
experience but those Pokemon don't (82:42 - 82:47)
really do anything for you if you were (82:44 - 82:50)
to see a Gerra or even a victi Victini (82:47 - 82:53)
in the wild you would get some sort of (82:50 - 82:56)
benefit besides just experiencing a one (82:53 - 83:00)
in a lifetime happening so if you were (82:56 - 83:02)
in a competition if you were competing (83:00 - 83:04)
if you were doing something that needed (83:02 - 83:07)
luck SL Victory and you saw a Victini in (83:04 - 83:09)
the falling asleep in the lore like that (83:07 - 83:11)
would be the best thing you could (83:09 - 83:13)
possibly experience yeah sure getting (83:11 - 83:17)
wishes granted is cool like great not (83:13 - 83:20)
realistic none of this is realistic it's (83:17 - 83:21)
Pokemon there (83:20 - 83:23)
also (83:21 - 83:25)
of me if I had a in front of me and (83:23 - 83:27)
asked me to give it a wish my wish would (83:25 - 83:30)
be for Cel but we can't have everything (83:27 - 83:32)
we (83:30 - 83:35)
want you can't say that that's not (83:32 - 83:37)
realistic what that's what the Pokemon (83:35 - 83:40)
this is a stup conversation about (83:37 - 83:41)
Pokemon I'm just being a pessimist all (83:40 - 83:43)
right I'm just not really taken by the (83:41 - 83:46)
argument that like it's granting wishes (83:43 - 83:49)
makes it like I don't really think that (83:46 - 83:52)
this is a list of top 10 Pokémon we want (83:49 - 83:54)
to meet in real life life this is like (83:52 - 83:58)
top 10 Pokémon that within the franchise (83:54 - 83:59)
and I I think those are two different (83:58 - 84:03)
lists and I me my argument would be like (83:59 - 84:05)
da definitely stands out out of 700 (84:03 - 84:08)
Pokemon but that's because of points I (84:05 - 84:10)
made but that's fine I've already (84:08 - 84:12)
crossed them out Will's turn just (84:10 - 84:14)
following on from your argument about (84:12 - 84:16)
standing out in (84:14 - 84:21)
722 Pokemon I think uh Slurpuff while it (84:16 - 84:25)
is cute and it is is sort of iconic (84:21 - 84:28)
within Generation 6 representing you (84:25 - 84:30)
know the the food and the Poke Puffs and (84:28 - 84:32)
everything it's not even notable as a (84:30 - 84:35)
Fairy Type there are other fairy types (84:32 - 84:37)
that are much more uh that you can (84:35 - 84:39)
identify much more clearly with being (84:37 - 84:42)
representative of the type and um I just (84:39 - 84:45)
think Slurpuff while it's cute and nice (84:42 - 84:48)
uh does not quite Merit being on this (84:45 - 84:52)
list I think Slurpuff uh does a is I'll (84:48 - 84:54)
start that sense in a different way I (84:52 - 84:57)
think there are certain Pokemon that go (84:54 - 85:00)
very far in terms of defining the (84:57 - 85:02)
aesthetic of a given generation I think (85:00 - 85:05)
uh lately I don't think it's necessarily (85:02 - 85:07)
the case with the first two generations (85:05 - 85:09)
but I think Generation 3 onward um (85:07 - 85:13)
there's a um subtle but consistent (85:09 - 85:16)
design theme around all of the Pokemon (85:13 - 85:18)
within a generation I feel like (85:16 - 85:23)
generation five is a very uh Sunny round (85:18 - 85:25)
generation in terms of its Pokemon and I (85:23 - 85:27)
feel like Slurpuff is one of those (85:25 - 85:30)
Pokemon for Gen 6 Gen 6 is a very (85:27 - 85:32)
colorful it's it's it's vibrant it's (85:30 - 85:35)
bouncy it's it's um because it's the (85:32 - 85:38)
first Pokemon in 3D uh it has a lot of (85:35 - 85:41)
depth and it and it benefits from uh not (85:38 - 85:42)
having Sprites and I feel like all of (85:41 - 85:45)
those uh traits also apply to Slurpuff (85:42 - 85:47)
very well so in that sense I think (85:45 - 85:49)
Slurpuff represents a lot of what is (85:47 - 85:52)
good and consistent about Generation 6 (85:49 - 85:54)
um what else was I was I going to say (85:52 - 85:57)
and the idea that it's not notable as a (85:54 - 85:59)
Fairy Type I would I would take issue (85:57 - 86:01)
with I don't I don't you didn't really (85:59 - 86:04)
provide a lot of um warrants behind that (86:01 - 86:07)
claim you just said it's not notable I I (86:04 - 86:09)
would argue it is notable it's it's it's (86:07 - 86:11)
one of the few Pokemon actually (86:09 - 86:14)
introduced as a Fairy Type along with uh (86:11 - 86:18)
stuff like Aroma and and uh fl's line (86:14 - 86:20)
like Flor just and stuff um it's one of (86:18 - 86:23)
the few introduced fairy type pokemon (86:20 - 86:26)
makes itable if you line up Slurpuff (86:23 - 86:31)
spritzy Floris Sylveon in a row and ask (86:26 - 86:33)
anyone can you point out which is the (86:31 - 86:35)
most fairy type Slurpuff is going to end (86:33 - 86:38)
up BL on that list uh I mean I don't (86:35 - 86:42)
know if that's a strong argument but I I (86:38 - 86:44)
like slurp puff but I don't see slurp (86:42 - 86:46)
puff making it to the top 10 we've (86:44 - 86:48)
already got one food Pokémon on the top (86:46 - 86:51)
10 how many delicious (86:48 - 86:54)
meals I like slur a lot but I can't when (86:51 - 86:57)
we're done with this list you can use it (86:54 - 86:59)
to make a meal for your significant (86:57 - 87:02)
other or for yourself and then uh take (86:59 - 87:05)
pictures of it and post it does that (87:02 - 87:06)
mean you don't like it either Micah for (87:05 - 87:10)
the top 10 I am this is what I'm going (87:06 - 87:12)
to do going forward if I am no two ways (87:10 - 87:14)
about a specific Pokemon I'm going to (87:12 - 87:16)
count it as a strike I generally don't (87:14 - 87:18)
have an interest in Slurpuff it's neat (87:16 - 87:21)
and it's cute but I agree with Steve (87:18 - 87:23)
that I don't see it making the top 10 (87:21 - 87:26)
because it's just not as interesting to (87:23 - 87:28)
me as a lot of the stuff on this list (87:26 - 87:31)
strike it it's been strike struck it's (87:28 - 87:34)
been struck what what we'll do here is (87:31 - 87:36)
we have uh we're going to take a break (87:34 - 87:40)
before the break here Geri lotad (87:36 - 87:44)
honchkrow Slurpuff herum Eevee and celby (87:40 - 87:47)
have all been cut vanilla is the only (87:44 - 87:49)
Pokemon that's made it to the top 10 we (87:47 - 87:51)
probably have to accelerate this in some (87:49 - 87:54)
aspect we have 32 remaining we have 32 (87:51 - 87:56)
remaining so we we'll probably have to (87:54 - 87:58)
do something to accelerate this a bit (87:56 - 88:01)
but we'll figure that out after our (87:58 - 88:04)
break and hopefully we can wrap this up (88:01 - 88:07)
in another less than an hour (88:04 - 88:11)
hopefully so we will be right (88:07 - 88:11)
[Music] (88:12 - 88:20)
back (88:21 - 88:24)
[Music] (88:26 - 88:39)
and we are back from our break we are (88:33 - 88:41)
still cutting and editing Pokemon I (88:39 - 88:43)
can't remember who nominated last I (88:41 - 88:47)
think will did right nominated puff we (88:43 - 88:50)
oh it's me then huh yeah it's Travis we (88:47 - 88:53)
could switch it up maybe well let's go (88:50 - 88:56)
through Travis's and I cuts and let's do (88:53 - 89:00)
a round of Pokemon we want to see on the (88:56 - 89:03)
top 10 list without picking our own does (89:00 - 89:04)
that make sense so am I picking one to (89:03 - 89:06)
cut or am I picking one that I want on (89:04 - 89:10)
the top 10 uh we'll do cut and me cut (89:06 - 89:12)
okay so that's fair for cuts and then (89:10 - 89:14)
we'll do Micah and Micah would nominate (89:12 - 89:16)
a Pokemon he'd want to see on the top 10 (89:14 - 89:18)
but he can't pick from his own list so (89:16 - 89:20)
we'll we'll try that route just to kind (89:18 - 89:23)
of differenti create the list a little (89:20 - 89:26)
bit and accelerate this process all (89:23 - 89:28)
right Will's list is looking the (89:26 - 89:30)
healthiest so I'll I'll Attack will I (89:28 - 89:32)
feel like that's all I've done but I'll (89:30 - 89:34)
I'll hit will again uh we're going for (89:32 - 89:38)
zor Arch what are you serious I'm 100% (89:34 - 89:42)
on board with this I'm very serious (89:38 - 89:46)
zark is notable for only two reasons (89:42 - 89:49)
reason one it has a unique ability um (89:46 - 89:51)
that's that's very tricky and makes for (89:49 - 89:53)
interesting games game play I'll concede (89:51 - 89:56)
that it's notable second because it is (89:53 - 90:00)
the Lucario of its generation Lucario is (89:56 - 90:02)
the worst Pokemon (90:00 - 90:06)
Baron if this is trying to be Lucario (90:02 - 90:08)
then it's then it's and the fact that (90:06 - 90:11)
it's it's it's it's trying to achieve (90:08 - 90:15)
complete garbage trash and not making it (90:11 - 90:17)
means it's probably the worst Pokemon of (90:15 - 90:20)
all the 40 on this list I have NOA why (90:17 - 90:22)
says it's the Lucario of it generation I (90:20 - 90:24)
don't even know what that means I I (90:22 - 90:27)
think what I I have to agree with Travis (90:24 - 90:29)
I think Pokemon companies saw the (90:27 - 90:32)
success in Lucario and they tried to (90:29 - 90:35)
apply that same marketing strategy to (90:32 - 90:37)
Zoroark and it didn't really work what (90:35 - 90:39)
did I miss in the marketing strategy (90:37 - 90:41)
because all I know is yes it has an (90:39 - 90:44)
extremely unique ability that no other (90:41 - 90:48)
Pokemon has ever replicated ever and in (90:44 - 90:50)
the first black and white games which (90:48 - 90:52)
you guys may not have realized the only (90:50 - 90:56)
way to get Zoroark was to have the (90:52 - 91:00)
distribution um legendary dogs and if (90:56 - 91:01)
you didn't have them you didn't get no (91:00 - 91:03)
Zoroark unless you had a friend who (91:01 - 91:05)
could get one breed it and give one to (91:03 - 91:08)
you Zoro is extremely special and it's (91:05 - 91:10)
just an amazing and beautiful creature I (91:08 - 91:12)
don't think that's true didn't you get a (91:10 - 91:14)
zarua through the through the game (91:12 - 91:17)
didn't like an NPC give you a zarua nope (91:14 - 91:19)
not until black and white too I mean (91:17 - 91:22)
Lucario was the first non Legend non- (91:19 - 91:25)
mythical Pokemon to be featured on a (91:22 - 91:27)
cover if I'm not mistaken of a movie and (91:25 - 91:30)
Zoroark was the second I mean that's (91:27 - 91:32)
fine all three of you hate on Zoroark (91:30 - 91:34)
you can take it from the list but I just (91:32 - 91:36)
think that that's really you're you're (91:34 - 91:38)
really missing out I think I think I (91:36 - 91:40)
think what what I think Steve said (91:38 - 91:42)
something that resonates with with why I (91:40 - 91:44)
don't like Zar that much and that it it (91:42 - 91:47)
feels more like a marketing Ploy than it (91:44 - 91:49)
feels like a Pokemon because Lucario was (91:47 - 91:50)
extremely successful and they tried for (91:49 - 91:55)
a similarly Edge and yet not evil design (91:50 - 91:57)
that's a two-stage Evolution that starts (91:55 - 91:58)
with something small and cute and (91:57 - 92:00)
evolves into something that seems (91:58 - 92:03)
threatening but also sort of agile (92:00 - 92:08)
and anro and an anthromorphic brooding (92:03 - 92:10)
animal um (92:08 - 92:14)
it feels exactly like a like a marketing (92:10 - 92:16)
strategy unless like a Pokemon I I don't (92:14 - 92:17)
understand why you're visiting your hate (92:16 - 92:20)
for some other Pokémon on poor Zoroark (92:17 - 92:22)
who is a glorious and wonderful creature (92:20 - 92:25)
that I a shadow of an even worse Pokemon (92:22 - 92:27)
I mean look all all these Pokemon are (92:25 - 92:30)
great but we got to get we got to be cut (92:27 - 92:32)
throat to uh take it you guys it's three (92:30 - 92:35)
against one take it to get luio and (92:32 - 92:38)
zoric are the Hot Topic of Pokemon you I (92:35 - 92:41)
will chop out your tongue and make you (92:38 - 92:46)
swallow it Gen Con two weeks away (92:41 - 92:49)
um let's go there's a lot of Pokemon on (92:46 - 92:51)
Micah's list that I don't really like (92:49 - 92:56)
but I don't thanks I don't see driam (92:51 - 92:59)
making the top 10 I think driam is (92:56 - 93:02)
really cool obviously not based on an (92:59 - 93:04)
animal but based on a balloon I think (93:02 - 93:07)
the lore behind driam is really cool and (93:04 - 93:09)
creepy and I'm all for creepy Pokemon (93:07 - 93:11)
just look at chandelier but I just don't (93:09 - 93:15)
see top 10 material in drif drif blo I'd (93:11 - 93:17)
be curious what your counterargument is (93:15 - 93:19)
but I don't think it would convince me (93:17 - 93:22)
to keep it on this list I think that (93:19 - 93:26)
with Ghost types um what draws us to (93:22 - 93:29)
them uh is the fact that they are sort (93:26 - 93:32)
of these strange siren calls that they (93:29 - 93:35)
are gorgeous to look at uh but deadly to (93:32 - 93:37)
interact with uh drift blim is a great (93:35 - 93:40)
example of that it it is probably the (93:37 - 93:43)
most friendly looking ghost type Pokemon (93:40 - 93:45)
and that makes me and I would assume (93:43 - 93:48)
other people love it at first sight and (93:45 - 93:51)
then the fact that you learn that um (93:48 - 93:55)
that it it finds people and and lifts (93:51 - 93:58)
them to and the fact that it it only (93:55 - 94:01)
Rises and and never uh sinks once it (93:58 - 94:03)
grabs people that um presumably it drops (94:01 - 94:08)
them to their death um that the jux toos (94:03 - 94:12)
of Allure and um mortality that we love (94:08 - 94:15)
in Ghost type Pokemon is perhaps best (94:12 - 94:18)
exemplified in drift blim uh I love (94:15 - 94:20)
drift blim quite a bit I love having a (94:18 - 94:22)
drift blim with ominous wind but but I (94:20 - 94:24)
don't think drif flim needs to make the (94:22 - 94:27)
cut you would cut it or I I would cut it (94:24 - 94:31)
oh okay Micah I agree okay I I was (94:27 - 94:33)
really interested in drifblim when you (94:31 - 94:35)
first encounter it but I'm not it's (94:33 - 94:38)
nothing that really stands out to me as (94:35 - 94:41)
a top 10 quality Pokemon uh okay drift (94:38 - 94:44)
Blum is cut Micah is there a Pokemon on (94:41 - 94:46)
the list that you would like to see go (94:44 - 94:48)
into the top (94:46 - 94:50)
10 I guess if there's not enough votes (94:48 - 94:53)
from everyone else it would have to be (94:50 - 94:55)
we would use let's use underline to (94:53 - 94:59)
signify the almost everyone agrees I (94:55 - 95:03)
would argue almost AR okay this is going (94:59 - 95:05)
to be tough for me CU I hate to hand (95:03 - 95:06)
this to you but I know that this is (95:05 - 95:08)
going to be a discussion anyways so we (95:06 - 95:11)
might as well have it now I feel like I (95:08 - 95:13)
would be okay with gold duck making the (95:11 - 95:17)
list uh I 100% agree Golduck is Iconic (95:13 - 95:19)
for all of the work that we do and I (95:17 - 95:21)
feel that Golduck should be on the list (95:19 - 95:23)
I feel like it's a flagship for the (95:21 - 95:27)
podcast and that gives it that lends (95:23 - 95:29)
some quality to it to be on the top 10 (95:27 - 95:31)
list in addition to that my opinion of (95:29 - 95:33)
gold duck has changed significantly (95:31 - 95:36)
since I've hung out with you and uh (95:33 - 95:39)
experienced Pokemon with you even in so (95:36 - 95:42)
that when I found a wild Golduck playing (95:39 - 95:44)
Pokémon go I got really excited and then (95:42 - 95:46)
I was like why am I excited it's a gold (95:44 - 95:48)
duck and I was like oh yeah Pokemon (95:46 - 95:50)
podcast that's awesome so I would be (95:48 - 95:52)
okay with it making the list Travis (95:50 - 95:55)
I I the only argument I would have (95:52 - 95:58)
against it is that um I think Psyduck is (95:55 - 96:02)
cuter um but that means a lot less than (95:58 - 96:06)
the the story that not only you shared (96:02 - 96:10)
on the show but also the the lore that (96:06 - 96:12)
that builds around our show and around (96:10 - 96:14)
the Pokemon in in my eyes so I think all (96:12 - 96:17)
of us agree I think you guys sold (96:14 - 96:19)
Golduck better than I (96:17 - 96:23)
could uh Golduck is on the list all (96:19 - 96:25)
right cross off Psyduck while we're at (96:23 - 96:26)
it cuz we're not going to put both of (96:25 - 96:28)
them on there okay will is there Pokemon (96:26 - 96:31)
on this uh that's not on your list that (96:28 - 96:33)
you would like to nominate to the top 10 (96:31 - 96:36)
uh I would put Chandelure because I (96:33 - 96:38)
should have had Chandelure on my list I (96:36 - 96:40)
forgot just when I saw you guys put it (96:38 - 96:42)
there I remembered not only that (96:40 - 96:45)
beautiful painting that you did for 649 (96:42 - 96:47)
Monsters of Chandelure thank you but my (96:45 - 96:51)
great pleasure in um uh using Chandelure (96:47 - 96:54)
in poking tournament and how much I (96:51 - 96:57)
enjoy uh the the way that he drags (96:54 - 97:00)
people into that alternate Dimension (96:57 - 97:02)
with the candles and then he Giggles as (97:00 - 97:04)
they well not people but you know the (97:02 - 97:06)
other Pokemon and then he Giggles as (97:04 - 97:07)
they are tormented in that alternate (97:06 - 97:09)
hell Dimension and I love that about (97:07 - 97:11)
Chandelure and it just gives him so much (97:09 - 97:14)
more uh credit and he's so unique in his (97:11 - 97:17)
fire ghost typing um and he can be very (97:14 - 97:20)
difficult to handle in a VGC competition (97:17 - 97:23)
as well I love I love me some chandelier (97:20 - 97:25)
obviously on Michel's list uh Travis (97:23 - 97:27)
where do you stand I like chandelier I (97:25 - 97:29)
don't love it as much as all of you but (97:27 - 97:31)
um (97:29 - 97:33)
it's you know in order to not have it be (97:31 - 97:36)
on the top 10 I would have to argue that (97:33 - 97:39)
one of you change your mind and I don't (97:36 - 97:41)
think that's going to happen and I also (97:39 - 97:42)
don't dislike chandelier to the extent (97:41 - 97:44)
that I would really be able to come up (97:42 - 97:46)
with a lot of things to say about it all (97:44 - 97:47)
right I like chandeler as a Pokemon I (97:46 - 97:51)
just it's yeah put it up chandel is on (97:47 - 97:54)
got three the list on the list Travis (97:51 - 97:57)
progress what are you nominating not on (97:54 - 97:58)
your list (97:57 - 98:02)
um I'm between two right now um I'm GNA (97:58 - 98:05)
go with Tyranitar sandstream (98:02 - 98:09)
Tyranitar I don't care I don't care what (98:05 - 98:12)
it's better than unnerve so overused I (98:09 - 98:16)
would I would argue against tanid so (98:12 - 98:17)
here's here so here's my here's my (98:16 - 98:20)
argument for it generation 2 is (98:17 - 98:23)
extremely important to those of us who (98:20 - 98:27)
have stuck with the game through (98:23 - 98:31)
its um through its entirety right (98:27 - 98:35)
generation 2 is what (98:31 - 98:38)
separates people who just played (98:35 - 98:40)
generation one were happy with that and (98:38 - 98:42)
and and didn't like what followed those (98:40 - 98:44)
of us who continued to play who played (98:42 - 98:49)
generation 2 and loved it are what the a (98:44 - 98:51)
lot of the fan base a lot of the adult (98:49 - 98:54)
adult fan what comprises a large portion (98:51 - 98:57)
of the adult fan base of this of this um (98:54 - 99:01)
fandom I guess of this franchise um (98:57 - 99:03)
there's you know we're getting to the (99:01 - 99:06)
point where people who were in like (99:03 - 99:08)
Elementary School when Gen 3 came out (99:06 - 99:10)
are now like adults and that's (99:08 - 99:13)
terrifying to me um but I think it's (99:10 - 99:14)
still safe to say that the majority of (99:13 - 99:18)
the adult fan base of Pokemon had Gen 2 (99:14 - 99:20)
as its sort of uh Turning Point going (99:18 - 99:22)
from what was inter to you as a kid to (99:20 - 99:25)
what was interesting to you as you grew (99:22 - 99:29)
up and Tyranitar I think um not only (99:25 - 99:31)
appears in the generation that is in (99:29 - 99:35)
that transition period but it also um (99:31 - 99:37)
balances (99:35 - 99:40)
to it being one of the sort of cool (99:37 - 99:42)
pseudo legendary Pokemon that's that's (99:40 - 99:45)
good in in competitive play makes it (99:42 - 99:48)
appeal both to kids because it's this (99:45 - 99:50)
hard to achieve Pokemon that I I know (99:48 - 99:51)
when I was a kid I liked those pseudo (99:50 - 99:53)
legendaries that were hard to evolve (99:51 - 99:55)
into because it felt like you had to be (99:53 - 99:56)
dedicated to this thing and that was a (99:55 - 99:58)
new experience to me to level up a (99:56 - 100:00)
Pokemon that far and I think it appeals (99:58 - 100:05)
to as you grow older the um and I mean (100:00 - 100:07)
some of that to me has has faded off as (100:05 - 100:09)
I'm an actual adult and I no longer find (100:07 - 100:12)
like Edge lord Pokemon that interesting (100:09 - 100:14)
but in that transition period when I was (100:12 - 100:15)
in in middle and high school I thought (100:14 - 100:20)
the the the cool um strong Pokemon were (100:15 - 100:22)
very interesting in Tyran AR exemplifies (100:20 - 100:24)
that a lot I think will what's what's (100:22 - 100:27)
your stance on Tyranitar uh I just just (100:24 - 100:31)
think that it's like so overused so out (100:27 - 100:35)
there just it's become kind of bland (100:31 - 100:38)
yeah that you know I agree like I mean (100:35 - 100:41)
in a competitive yeah but even world (100:38 - 100:43)
even like Tyranitar's Mega Evolution (100:41 - 100:47)
like doesn't really benefited in any way (100:43 - 100:49)
it's kind of cool but at the same time (100:47 - 100:52)
it didn't it wasn't imp actul like low (100:49 - 100:56)
PES Mega Evolution my main argument for (100:52 - 100:59)
Tyranitar and why it's an important (100:56 - 101:02)
Pokemon to me is because I have for the (100:59 - 101:04)
longest time since I was a kid been a (101:02 - 101:05)
huge fan of (101:04 - 101:08)
Godzilla uh excluding of course Godzilla (101:05 - 101:11)
2000 which is by far the worst pile of (101:08 - 101:13)
cinematic trash that has is that the one (101:11 - 101:15)
Matthew bradick or whatever it is yep (101:13 - 101:17)
it's the one where Godzilla is (101:15 - 101:20)
essentially just a T-Rex and that's it (101:17 - 101:23)
but Tyranitar is like a i it's it's like (101:20 - 101:26)
the closest Pokemon to (101:23 - 101:29)
Godzilla uh that exists and to me when I (101:26 - 101:32)
when you know growing up with Gen one (101:29 - 101:34)
and gen two and everything really (101:32 - 101:36)
resonated with me because I was so into (101:34 - 101:39)
Godzilla and the Mega Evolution for (101:36 - 101:41)
Tyranitar is even more awesome to me (101:39 - 101:45)
because it it borrows a lot from the (101:41 - 101:48)
construction of Mecca Godzilla which is (101:45 - 101:52)
also an important part of that franchise (101:48 - 101:53)
um on top of that there's all kinds of (101:52 - 101:55)
really cool things about what it does (101:53 - 101:58)
and it's you know biology and things (101:55 - 102:01)
like that like it destroys mountains and (101:58 - 102:04)
lives in them and stuff like that that I (102:01 - 102:09)
think helps build that Godzilla like (102:04 - 102:11)
image for Tyranitar and I think makes it (102:09 - 102:13)
a really awesome Pokemon well we got two (102:11 - 102:17)
against unless will change his mind um (102:13 - 102:21)
two against two four so unless I'm not (102:17 - 102:24)
changing my mind on kitur so that (102:21 - 102:26)
basically means it's struck right (102:24 - 102:29)
like majority it's I feel like it's not (102:26 - 102:31)
going to come back to you don't think so (102:29 - 102:35)
to it to I I don't see anybody coming (102:31 - 102:37)
back to it to argue anything further (102:35 - 102:39)
than what we've already argued all right (102:37 - 102:41)
well we will strike it then I mean tanar (102:39 - 102:43)
is cool it breaks my heart but I will (102:41 - 102:45)
accept I mean I look at most Pokemon (102:43 - 102:49)
where like Mega Evolution is like the (102:45 - 102:51)
here is here is (102:49 - 102:55)
your promotion here is for people to (102:51 - 102:57)
remember you and when they did that tan (102:55 - 103:01)
Tyranitar I was just like okay it sure (102:57 - 103:04)
of course you got it good for you but (103:01 - 103:07)
that's just me who nominated that (103:04 - 103:09)
me how sad is it that he went to promote (103:07 - 103:11)
it and it got (103:09 - 103:14)
destroyed no that's all right feel my (103:11 - 103:16)
argument was pretty good yeah I think so (103:14 - 103:20)
too good I appreciate the effort I will (103:16 - 103:24)
nominate hucha actually as a Pokemon (103:20 - 103:28)
that could make it to the top 10 I yes (103:24 - 103:31)
even before I got into wrestling which (103:28 - 103:35)
was about two years ago now when I (103:31 - 103:38)
played Generation 6 no joke no (103:35 - 103:40)
exaggeration because I didn't look at (103:38 - 103:43)
the Pokemon early when I encountered (103:40 - 103:46)
Hawlucha outside of the second gym if (103:43 - 103:49)
I'm not mistaken on my way to the third (103:46 - 103:51)
gym somebody's going to correct me and (103:49 - 103:53)
go well actually route 7even was over (103:51 - 103:55)
here so you would have had three badges (103:53 - 103:58)
um but anyways when I encountered (103:55 - 104:02)
Hawlucha it it was it brought back A (103:58 - 104:04)
Rush of memories of Generation 1 and (104:02 - 104:07)
generation 2 before the internet before (104:04 - 104:11)
we saw all the Pokemon and it was almost (104:07 - 104:13)
like that I don't want to like that Rush (104:11 - 104:16)
of Golduck of I have no clue what this (104:13 - 104:17)
is I don't know if it's super rare I (104:16 - 104:20)
don't know if it's common like Pidgey I (104:17 - 104:22)
just want want it that feeling of (104:20 - 104:25)
Hawlucha is something I hope that I get (104:22 - 104:29)
in Generation 7 uh and it's looking like (104:25 - 104:30)
I might not get that feeling because (104:29 - 104:32)
Pokemon loves to show every single (104:30 - 104:33)
Pokemon they created before the game (104:32 - 104:37)
comes out but now that I love wrestling (104:33 - 104:42)
that kind of solidifies that foundation (104:37 - 104:44)
for my love of Hawlucha and I actually (104:42 - 104:46)
can't believe I forgot it on my list but (104:44 - 104:48)
yeah I like Hawlucha I would also be in (104:46 - 104:49)
favor of Hawlucha I think it is a (104:48 - 104:51)
beautiful and glorious and unique (104:49 - 104:54)
creature that deserves respect and (104:51 - 104:58)
understanding I don't really love hucha (104:54 - 105:01)
um so an argument that I can't make but (104:58 - 105:03)
I'll at least bring up I'm white so it (105:01 - 105:05)
doesn't matter really what I say in (105:03 - 105:07)
reference to this but the fact that it's (105:05 - 105:09)
just like cultural appropriation the (105:07 - 105:10)
Pokemon in the sense that it's like a (105:09 - 105:13)
Luchador and like some Japanese person (105:10 - 105:16)
is like hey this thing that uh people (105:13 - 105:18)
make fun of all the time that's (105:16 - 105:22)
important to people in uh in Mexico (105:18 - 105:24)
let's just profit off of it is kind of (105:22 - 105:26)
weird um but then again it doesn't (105:24 - 105:28)
matter because I'm a white person so if (105:26 - 105:30)
my perspective on that really doesn't (105:28 - 105:33)
matter but it's actually there are a lot (105:30 - 105:35)
of elements to it that it was inspired (105:33 - 105:38)
by Aztec culture and and I would also (105:35 - 105:41)
argue that you do have a bit of a (105:38 - 105:43)
misunderstanding of Luchador culture (105:41 - 105:46)
because maybe the people you know make (105:43 - 105:48)
fun of luchadors but there are a lot of (105:46 - 105:50)
people that hold them in tremendous (105:48 - 105:51)
respect (105:50 - 105:53)
that's what that's what I'm that's what (105:51 - 105:55)
I'm no I'm not I'm not saying I'm not (105:53 - 105:57)
saying only people in Mexico I'm saying (105:55 - 105:58)
you know there are a lot of people in (105:57 - 106:01)
this country who love luchadors and love (105:58 - 106:04)
the the Lucha style of fighting (106:01 - 106:06)
regardless that's not my my main (106:04 - 106:08)
argument my main argument is that um (106:06 - 106:10)
while it is a very enticing Pokemon as (106:08 - 106:12)
Steve says that when you when you (106:10 - 106:15)
encounter it it is um it feels like a (106:12 - 106:17)
Pokemon you want to have but it does not (106:15 - 106:19)
deliver on that promise the only (106:17 - 106:21)
interesting thing is that it learns (106:19 - 106:22)
press which is a confusing move that is (106:21 - 106:24)
both flying and fighting type at the (106:22 - 106:27)
same time it's extremely underwhelming (106:24 - 106:29)
when you actually have it on your team (106:27 - 106:33)
and it and it and it uh it feels like (106:29 - 106:36)
it's purely just a combination of flying (106:33 - 106:41)
and fighting and like it doesn't have a (106:36 - 106:43)
it doesn't have a personality behind its (106:41 - 106:46)
concept of of being a wrestling Pokemon (106:43 - 106:48)
like I I feel like it doesn't transcend (106:46 - 106:51)
out of that sort of mashup that it is (106:48 - 106:53)
I would argue that it does though (106:51 - 106:57)
because luchadors typically in build (106:53 - 106:59)
aside from very small amount of (106:57 - 107:02)
luchadors that are really ripped and (106:59 - 107:04)
very large luchadors are pretty small (107:02 - 107:07)
and quick and that's kind of their thing (107:04 - 107:10)
is that they that's kind of that that (107:07 - 107:14)
you know Luchador training is to be fast (107:10 - 107:18)
and agile and hucha is I mean it's it's (107:14 - 107:21)
pretty quick and (107:18 - 107:23)
fine put it on the list I just needed to (107:21 - 107:24)
to show my descent cuz I don't really (107:23 - 107:27)
like the Pokemon that much no that's (107:24 - 107:29)
fine I I mean I don't I'm probably not (107:27 - 107:30)
going to agree with every Pokemon on the (107:29 - 107:32)
list either but oh I just saw you tried (107:30 - 107:33)
to put Golduck (107:32 - 107:37)
twice double gold double well we're if (107:33 - 107:39)
we're putting only Birds on this list (107:37 - 107:42)
then um let's that actually worked (107:39 - 107:44)
really well for acceleration purposes (107:42 - 107:46)
can we would you guys be cool if we each (107:44 - 107:50)
cut one Pokemon from our own list okay (107:46 - 107:51)
yeah yeah I could do that (107:50 - 107:54)
uh we'll start with Micah I guess and go (107:51 - 107:55)
through there I'm just going to cut (107:54 - 107:57)
Garchomp cuz I know that's an uphill (107:55 - 107:59)
battle and it's not worth (107:57 - 108:02)
it I was gonna fight really hard against (107:59 - 108:07)
G as cool as it is as a missile faced (108:02 - 108:10)
Shark Dragon it's not worth the fight (108:07 - 108:13)
will Pokemon you'd cut uh I can let fbe (108:10 - 108:15)
go I know it is beautiful and special to (108:13 - 108:17)
me but it's not beautiful and special to (108:15 - 108:19)
a lot of other people really what an (108:17 - 108:21)
upset yeah crazy (108:19 - 108:23)
I was I thought you would fight real (108:21 - 108:25)
hard for that no I'm honest I'm honest I (108:23 - 108:27)
know that it's not the strongest thing (108:25 - 108:30)
out there okay Travis I'm G to cut (108:27 - 108:32)
gorist even though it's like my third (108:30 - 108:37)
favorite Pokemon I have no defense for (108:32 - 108:41)
why it's cool other than it has multiple (108:37 - 108:44)
forms and uh it's really cute like I (108:41 - 108:47)
like I I it's purely aesthetic and (108:44 - 108:49)
personal reasons that makes me like it (108:47 - 108:51)
so I can't I wouldn't be able to defend (108:49 - 108:55)
it okay I am going to cut poly toad I (108:51 - 108:58)
like poly toad a lot but I couldn't (108:55 - 109:01)
defend why I could defend poto just (108:58 - 109:02)
because of the split Evolution thing but (109:01 - 109:04)
that's the only thing I have going for (109:02 - 109:06)
it and no one here seems shocked that (109:04 - 109:09)
I'm cutting it though I thought you (109:06 - 109:12)
gonna cut omite because it's just a meme (109:09 - 109:14)
I will I will probably defend omite (109:12 - 109:17)
pretty hard actually but uh do you what (109:14 - 109:19)
you guys want to do one round of uh (109:17 - 109:21)
threatening other people Pokémon yeah (109:19 - 109:24)
let's get the knives back out all right (109:21 - 109:26)
we we were all too friendly and calm (109:24 - 109:29)
that section so Micah going with you any (109:26 - 109:32)
Pokemon you'd (109:29 - 109:35)
cut as much as I like (109:32 - 109:38)
froy I feel like we've already addressed (109:35 - 109:42)
Froakie as a possible cut and I don't (109:38 - 109:45)
feel like there's anything that we can (109:42 - 109:49)
say that's going to bring it back to a (109:45 - 109:51)
positive and put it on the list list as (109:49 - 109:54)
much as of those three starters froi is (109:51 - 109:57)
my favorite of the three I don't see it (109:54 - 110:00)
going on the list purely because (109:57 - 110:03)
it's already (110:00 - 110:04)
controversial yeah I don't think you're (110:03 - 110:06)
going to be able to convince will for (110:04 - 110:09)
that oh no oh no no (110:06 - 110:12)
no I would say that first you have to (110:09 - 110:14)
think of the consequences of of striking (110:12 - 110:18)
Froakie because I think we need a (110:14 - 110:20)
starter on the list to represent one of (110:18 - 110:22)
the most important things about the (110:20 - 110:24)
games which is that you you play through (110:22 - 110:26)
the game and you grow with your starter (110:24 - 110:28)
Pokemon and you already said that of the (110:26 - 110:31)
three froy of the three remaining that (110:28 - 110:33)
syndic Quil Chespin Froakie that Froakie (110:31 - 110:35)
is your favorite of those three oh I (110:33 - 110:39)
meant the three of X and Y well Froakie (110:35 - 110:41)
is still the best of those three (110:39 - 110:45)
regardless um and if you if you cut froy (110:41 - 110:48)
you're compromising to um to starters (110:45 - 110:51)
that are less interesting I turn to my (110:48 - 110:55)
point that um froi does very well what I (110:51 - 110:57)
think make for some of the best Pokemon (110:55 - 111:01)
designs namely Pokemon's particular (110:57 - 111:05)
brand of cute where well Pokemon does (111:01 - 111:08)
have things that are um traditionally (111:05 - 111:10)
adorable that a lot of the Pokemon that (111:08 - 111:12)
come to be known as as cute are the ones (111:10 - 111:14)
that have something a little off about (111:12 - 111:17)
them that maybe don't uh in froakie's (111:14 - 111:19)
case has sort of like a blank expression (111:17 - 111:22)
or a oblivious expression we're not (111:19 - 111:24)
including gen 7 Pokémon in this but as a (111:22 - 111:26)
reference I would say rowlet is a (111:24 - 111:28)
Pokémon that I and a lot of people (111:26 - 111:29)
completely love when it was announced (111:28 - 111:32)
and I feel like um froy (111:29 - 111:36)
represents that same um type of (111:32 - 111:39)
Adoration of a of a Pokemon that seem or (111:36 - 111:42)
mimic you as well a Pokemon that um you (111:39 - 111:44)
feel like you are defending it in your (111:42 - 111:47)
adoration because it seems like it has (111:44 - 111:49)
the world against it and you its trainer (111:47 - 111:51)
are going to train it and show the world (111:49 - 111:53)
that it's actually the greatest Pokemon (111:51 - 111:56)
of all um to show that the underdog has (111:53 - 111:58)
the ability to change the world and (111:56 - 111:59)
that's uh one of the things that Pokemon (111:58 - 112:02)
is all about now let's get not get crazy (111:59 - 112:04)
here comparing any one Pokemon on this (112:02 - 112:07)
list to mimikyu yeah Noe nope nope Noe (112:04 - 112:09)
nothing compares to the beauty of that (112:07 - 112:12)
strange beautiful creature I uh totally (112:09 - 112:16)
get how much you like froy Travis but I (112:12 - 112:18)
I am probably the only person here (112:16 - 112:20)
without a starter on my list I don't (112:18 - 112:22)
starters just don't do it for me I don't (112:20 - 112:26)
I don't know why you have Eevee which (112:22 - 112:29)
yeah I mean that's I feel like I'm just (112:26 - 112:32)
dishing out these like awesome defenses (112:29 - 112:35)
I'm just being cut down left I would say (112:32 - 112:37)
that you have one critical very critical (112:35 - 112:39)
error in your defense there is no (112:37 - 112:41)
requirement that there be a starter on (112:39 - 112:43)
the final list there's no requirement (112:41 - 112:44)
but I think we would all I think we (112:43 - 112:47)
would all be I think our list would be (112:44 - 112:48)
there would be a (112:47 - 112:51)
conspicuous whole in our list if we did (112:48 - 112:53)
not include a starter and I (112:51 - 112:56)
think starters are an important thing I (112:53 - 112:59)
uh I me I recall a a a rather famous (112:56 - 113:01)
other list of 10 Pokemon called I (112:59 - 113:04)
believe the Kaos 10 that had no starters (113:01 - 113:06)
on it that's that's I mean if you're (113:04 - 113:08)
going to make if you are adamant for a (113:06 - 113:10)
starter on the list I would I would put (113:08 - 113:13)
Chespin on it I think and I would (113:10 - 113:16)
probably pick syndic Quil I I think (113:13 - 113:19)
Greninja is the coolest out of the final (113:16 - 113:22)
evolution but this isn't a this isn't a (113:19 - 113:25)
fine knock froak off just keep bleeding (113:22 - 113:27)
every time one of you makes me defend a (113:25 - 113:30)
Pokemon and I give the best like uh (113:27 - 113:33)
Underdog defense I can and nobody nobody (113:30 - 113:36)
cares it's (113:33 - 113:39)
fine I mean I had a pretty good reason (113:36 - 113:41)
for Hawlucha and it wasn't even my my (113:39 - 113:44)
Pokemon yeah I'm not saying I'm the only (113:41 - 113:46)
one we're all giving good defenses but (113:44 - 113:50)
it hurts yeah uh who uh will who would (113:46 - 113:54)
cut uh I'd say that Ducklett has to go (113:50 - 113:57)
um I know gen five is my favorite gen (113:54 - 113:59)
and pretty much every Pokemon in Gen 5 (113:57 - 114:01)
except probably gothorita and its line (113:59 - 114:05)
are absolute wonders to me but Ducklett (114:01 - 114:09)
is you know it's it's like the goofy yes (114:05 - 114:11)
the ugly duckling turns into the swan (114:09 - 114:14)
but it just doesn't do much for me so (114:11 - 114:16)
yeah it can go it it's not even an ugly (114:14 - 114:18)
duckling though that's the problem I (114:16 - 114:20)
know it's a cutie duckling cute duck (114:18 - 114:23)
yeah I like ducks a lot as of gold (114:20 - 114:26)
duck somewh I really like birds but (114:23 - 114:29)
that's why I farfetch is also on the (114:26 - 114:31)
list uh I can I can see duck lick going (114:29 - 114:33)
but I just thought the whole ugly (114:31 - 114:35)
duckling Swan thing was really cool and (114:33 - 114:39)
I think that that Evolution line while (114:35 - 114:41)
it's so drastically different like if (114:39 - 114:44)
you look at Chespin and chesnot and that (114:41 - 114:46)
all makes sense when you look at that (114:44 - 114:48)
evolutionary line when if you were to (114:46 - 114:49)
separate and show somebody Ducklett and (114:48 - 114:50)
Swan (114:49 - 114:52)
they probably wouldn't see why it would (114:50 - 114:55)
evolve but at the same time even though (114:52 - 114:56)
they're so drastically different that (114:55 - 115:00)
Evolution line still makes 100% sense (114:56 - 115:02)
and I think that's cool even though I (115:00 - 115:04)
don't like swana at all but duckett's (115:02 - 115:06)
really cool so I will cut the duck yeah (115:04 - 115:08)
I think there are a lot of other Pokemon (115:06 - 115:10)
in the this list that can make the same (115:08 - 115:11)
point like I think Meowth can make the (115:10 - 115:14)
same point I would Evolution meow and (115:11 - 115:17)
Persian kind of still look very similar (115:14 - 115:18)
but yeah but I think they make a similar (115:17 - 115:21)
Point yeah uh Travis who would you cut (115:18 - 115:23)
I'm going to ask the question um that (115:21 - 115:25)
I'm sure all the listeners are asking (115:23 - 115:28)
why is Talon flame still in the (115:25 - 115:32)
running Talon flame is (115:28 - 115:35)
awesome not only is Talon flame one of (115:32 - 115:37)
the most part of the archetype that's (115:35 - 115:39)
one of the most boring archetypes in all (115:37 - 115:41)
of uh Pokemon design namely the (115:39 - 115:44)
throwaway bird that you run into uh at (115:41 - 115:47)
the beginning of the game U but it also (115:44 - 115:50)
is an extremely uninspired design that's (115:47 - 115:52)
it's just like a bird that's kind of on (115:50 - 115:57)
fire um if Talonflame didn't have the uh (115:52 - 116:00)
Gail Wing's ability um no one would (115:57 - 116:02)
remember this Pokemon at all okay okay (116:00 - 116:04)
but let me just point out that Talon (116:02 - 116:07)
flame does have the gaale wings ability (116:04 - 116:10)
and the fact that it is a major (116:07 - 116:12)
competitive uh Pokemon that you can use (116:10 - 116:16)
that is a beautiful fire phoenix in the (116:12 - 116:18)
sky but that anybody can get right that (116:16 - 116:21)
is its Glory that anybody can get a (116:18 - 116:23)
little Fletchling and grow it up into a (116:21 - 116:25)
beautiful beautiful flaming Talon Flame (116:23 - 116:27)
or you know in the end go to somebody's (116:25 - 116:29)
Friend Safari and get the one with the (116:27 - 116:31)
hidden ability so you can have Gail (116:29 - 116:33)
wings or have will breed you a Gail (116:31 - 116:35)
Wings Talent flame yeah that is the that (116:33 - 116:37)
is the critical error in your (116:35 - 116:39)
argumentation because if it were the if (116:37 - 116:42)
it were the first if it were a uh (116:39 - 116:44)
primary ability I would be totally with (116:42 - 116:45)
you but it's not it's a hidden ability (116:44 - 116:49)
you have to work for it so it's it it it (116:45 - 116:50)
it could have been the the Pokemon that (116:49 - 116:53)
is an accept an accessible Pokemon that (116:50 - 116:55)
anyone can get but it's not right (116:53 - 116:57)
because uh you have to have the Friend (116:55 - 116:59)
Safari version that has the hidden (116:57 - 117:03)
ability and although I although I agree (116:59 - 117:05)
that the competitive aspect of a Pokemon (117:03 - 117:09)
is is important for how we uh determine (117:05 - 117:11)
certain Pokemon being on the list I (117:09 - 117:14)
think tailon flame is an example of a (117:11 - 117:17)
Pokemon that divorced from its (117:14 - 117:19)
competitive viability has no absolutely (117:17 - 117:22)
no leg to stand on and you need at least (117:19 - 117:25)
um in my eyes there has have to be at (117:22 - 117:27)
least two rationales for why a Pokemon (117:25 - 117:29)
should be on the list this only has one (117:27 - 117:31)
beautiful and a flame body Talon flame (117:29 - 117:32)
will help you hatch (117:31 - 117:36)
eggs Micah Steve I would rather take (117:32 - 117:38)
pidot over Talon flame if I'm if I'm (117:36 - 117:41)
talking straight Birds also P gen also (117:38 - 117:43)
pidot has the sweet one of the sweetest (117:41 - 117:44)
Mega Evolutions that gets forgotten (117:43 - 117:46)
about yeah wait till Talon flame gets a (117:44 - 117:50)
Mega Evolution and it's pure fire you (117:46 - 117:52)
can like gen one Pokemon without being a (117:50 - 117:56)
gen warer I disagree (117:52 - 118:00)
that's no I love Oddish I can't lie yeah (117:56 - 118:02)
you have no gen one Pokemon on your list (118:00 - 118:06)
that's amazing are you a gen fer yes I (118:02 - 118:09)
am uh so we're cutting Talon flame I (118:06 - 118:12)
have no real opinion about it so that's (118:09 - 118:16)
a strike for me who oh oh my cut I'm (118:12 - 118:18)
sorry I was doing this highlighting for (118:16 - 118:20)
our just our eye (118:18 - 118:24)
to make that easier um if I was to cut a (118:20 - 118:27)
Pokemon will has a lot of Pokemon on (118:24 - 118:28)
this (118:27 - 118:32)
list I have like so few left yeah you (118:28 - 118:37)
have one on you you have one on yeah um (118:32 - 118:40)
I would Pro why is hydreon here he's (118:37 - 118:44)
because he's so cool he's a dark dragon (118:40 - 118:47)
all right the first of his kind I I I (118:44 - 118:49)
would not argue against hyd Dragon at (118:47 - 118:52)
this point if we just cut Reuniclus now (118:49 - 118:56)
I can let re I can let though (118:52 - 118:59)
wow I mean if if that's the choice (118:56 - 119:00)
Reuniclus can go into the Flames (118:59 - 119:04)
hydrogen is a thousand Reuniclus the (119:00 - 119:06)
Flames of all of your remaining fire (119:04 - 119:09)
Pokemon Micah let's do one more round of (119:06 - 119:13)
cuts Micah here go oh (119:09 - 119:13)
boy (119:14 - 119:20)
um all right Garbodor really (119:17 - 119:21)
come (119:20 - 119:24)
on are we really is this a conversation (119:21 - 119:28)
we even need to have yes it's a cool (119:24 - 119:30)
design and when I saw it I was like yo (119:28 - 119:32)
they made a Pokemon out of garbage (119:30 - 119:34)
that's awesome I think beyond that (119:32 - 119:37)
initial excitement there's nothing else (119:34 - 119:40)
about it that I care about it's it's a (119:37 - 119:42)
call back to things like muck and grimer (119:40 - 119:44)
I yes it's (119:42 - 119:47)
pandering and that's pretty much it I (119:44 - 119:52)
think Garbodor Garb odor sorry does a (119:47 - 119:55)
lot of things for Pokemon I think one is (119:52 - 119:59)
it shows that people think Pokemon is a (119:55 - 120:02)
joke in a way and this might sound (119:59 - 120:04)
really ironic but let me hear Let me (120:02 - 120:06)
hear me out here a lot of people outside (120:04 - 120:08)
of the Pokemon world would go oh (120:06 - 120:10)
Pokemon's not creative anymore anything (120:08 - 120:13)
after the one first 151 are not original (120:10 - 120:15)
what are they going to make a trash (120:13 - 120:18)
Pokemon next and it's and yes Garbodor (120:15 - 120:20)
has existed for several years and but we (120:18 - 120:23)
already made that argument for vanilla (120:20 - 120:27)
yep but Garbodor is literal trash you're (120:23 - 120:31)
right you're absolutely right get it off (120:27 - 120:33)
the (120:31 - 120:33)
list I would have been I would have been (120:35 - 120:41)
with you until because I don't feel (120:37 - 120:44)
like I don't feel like (120:41 - 120:46)
saying uh yeah I would have been with (120:44 - 120:48)
you until Mah made the point that we've (120:46 - 120:50)
already we are already have the Pokemon (120:48 - 120:53)
that represents that namely vanilla um (120:50 - 120:54)
see Steve you shouldn't have let that (120:53 - 120:58)
slide so I yeah if if all that it's has (120:54 - 121:00)
going for it is is eclipsed by the (120:58 - 121:02)
greatness of vanilla then take it off (121:00 - 121:06)
I'll take it off but Garbodor is I love (121:02 - 121:09)
Garbodor is like Muk but just better in (121:06 - 121:12)
every way and M Muk was already it's (121:09 - 121:14)
better than one Pokemon yeah Muk was (121:12 - 121:17)
already pretty cool I I like garer a lot (121:14 - 121:19)
but I wouldn't put I don't think it I (121:17 - 121:22)
was in favor in the top I was in favor (121:19 - 121:24)
of garbot because uh it's the only (121:22 - 121:26)
secret rare I ever pulled oh that's not (121:24 - 121:27)
true it was the second secret rare I (121:26 - 121:29)
ever pulled and it was a beautiful (121:27 - 121:30)
glorious (121:29 - 121:34)
card will your cut oh boy what do I have (121:30 - 121:38)
left there's hard things to touch (121:34 - 121:42)
here and well there's nothing on Micah's (121:38 - 121:44)
list that I want to take out (121:42 - 121:47)
anymore (121:44 - 121:47)
um I think esper is over glorified for (121:48 - 121:57)
derpiness and nah that can go Micah (121:52 - 122:00)
what's your stand on esper I I like (121:57 - 122:04)
esper I think it's the like blank stair (122:00 - 122:07)
is pretty cute but I don't like it (122:04 - 122:08)
enough to (122:07 - 122:12)
argue in its favor I guess (122:08 - 122:18)
Travis I liked esper kind of when it was (122:12 - 122:20)
announced (122:18 - 122:22)
um and then when everyone fell (122:20 - 122:25)
completely in love with it I was just (122:22 - 122:28)
kind of confused I thought it was a fine (122:25 - 122:31)
Pokemon to begin with and I but I just (122:28 - 122:34)
don't get it I don't get what's so cool (122:31 - 122:38)
about it I think up to up to this point (122:34 - 122:43)
Meowth Persian perugi Del caty Skitty I (122:38 - 122:47)
think they were all very weak designed (122:43 - 122:51)
cat Pokémon and OB obviously cats are (122:47 - 122:53)
the life of certain parts of the (122:51 - 122:56)
internet and I think esper was what (122:53 - 122:58)
everyone wanted and I think meow stick (122:56 - 123:01)
es esper is the perfect internet cat but (122:58 - 123:03)
to me that's a very shallow thing yeah (123:01 - 123:06)
and I think esper actually compared to (123:03 - 123:08)
other cat Pokemon barely looks like a (123:06 - 123:11)
cat agreed compared compared to like (123:08 - 123:16)
perin come on yeah and per I I get like (123:11 - 123:20)
perin and perugi are strong cat Pokemon (123:16 - 123:24)
but not the cat Pokemon I want just like (123:20 - 123:28)
rockruff is the dog Pokemon I want and I (123:24 - 123:31)
would say that rockruff and esper are (123:28 - 123:35)
the two actual pets that I would want (123:31 - 123:38)
that being said I'm okay with cutting (123:35 - 123:42)
esper because the I I would rather argue (123:38 - 123:44)
for the rest of the Pokemon surviving on (123:42 - 123:48)
my list who made that cut will me okay (123:44 - 123:52)
Travis I'm I'm going to cut (123:48 - 123:58)
shenja hard no hard no no no shinja has (123:52 - 124:00)
to stay you didn't even let me get my (123:58 - 124:02)
argument oh make your argument hard no (124:00 - 124:05)
hard no the only thing that makes shinja (124:02 - 124:06)
interesting is that it's a gimmick (124:05 - 124:09)
there's no place for gimmick on our top (124:06 - 124:11)
10 list it's interesting how it evolves (124:09 - 124:13)
in a complicated way where you need an (124:11 - 124:15)
extra slot open and you need depending (124:13 - 124:17)
on the generation you need an extra (124:15 - 124:19)
Pokeball I didn't even know that um it's (124:17 - 124:22)
interesting that it has one HP and it (124:19 - 124:25)
has Wonder guard so it only takes damage (124:22 - 124:29)
if it's s if a move is super effective (124:25 - 124:32)
against it you can't pile gimmick a top (124:29 - 124:33)
gimmick a top gimmick and make an (124:32 - 124:36)
interesting Pokemon I mean you can and (124:33 - 124:38)
that and that is kind of successful here (124:36 - 124:40)
but I but I don't think you can pile (124:38 - 124:42)
gimmick upon gimmick upon gimmick and (124:40 - 124:44)
get a an iconic Pokemon and our list (124:42 - 124:47)
isn't supposed to be cool Pokemon that (124:44 - 124:48)
we kind of like these are supposed to be (124:47 - 124:51)
the top 10 and I don't think that I (124:48 - 124:53)
don't think that clever makes for a top (124:51 - 124:57)
10 Pokemon I would argue that shinja is (124:53 - 124:59)
not a Pokemon that I kind of like it is (124:57 - 125:01)
in my top three favorite Pokemon of all (124:59 - 125:04)
time because there is literally no (125:01 - 125:06)
Pokemon like it there is no Pokemon that (125:04 - 125:10)
does that has the path that it (125:06 - 125:13)
has and I think that makes it really (125:10 - 125:16)
interesting I would like to see more (125:13 - 125:20)
Pokemon have interesting ways of of (125:16 - 125:23)
entering your journey because right now (125:20 - 125:25)
everything pretty much everything is (125:23 - 125:27)
just you level it to a certain point you (125:25 - 125:29)
trade it you use a stone I yeah but (125:27 - 125:31)
that's manufactured interest I think I (125:29 - 125:34)
think that interest that comes um from (125:31 - 125:36)
just the interaction with the Pokemon (125:34 - 125:38)
with its aesthetic and with and with its (125:36 - 125:41)
design is a lot uh deeper of an interest (125:38 - 125:42)
it's a lot more meaningful of an (125:41 - 125:45)
interest than something that's that's (125:42 - 125:47)
produced mechanically I think that's (125:45 - 125:50)
sort of artificial and um (125:47 - 125:53)
uh Hollow and I would say in support of (125:50 - 125:56)
Micah if I had had more than 24 hours to (125:53 - 125:58)
think about my list Singa shinja would (125:56 - 126:00)
probably be on it I I think shinja is an (125:58 - 126:03)
amazing Pokemon I think we italicize it (126:00 - 126:06)
for now because I'm on Travis's side and (126:03 - 126:07)
that's two verse two I don't know why (126:06 - 126:10)
hydren got italicized I sacrific Ray (126:07 - 126:12)
unich just because we talked about him I (126:10 - 126:14)
just italicize is not what we talked (126:12 - 126:19)
about I I am uh a huge fan of shinja (126:14 - 126:23)
for several reasons so um okay we'll (126:19 - 126:25)
come back to that while I have conceded (126:23 - 126:26)
to a lot of them shinja is one that I (126:25 - 126:29)
will not ConEd to but if you want to (126:26 - 126:31)
argue against it further well I mean we (126:29 - 126:33)
can spend more time on chinja or we can (126:31 - 126:35)
just Whittle down the list even more (126:33 - 126:38)
right cuz yeah we could just cut four (126:35 - 126:39)
more and then all of a sudden like Chen (126:38 - 126:42)
ninjas a Chee in but like we can come (126:39 - 126:45)
back um Travis was that your cut Shen (126:42 - 126:52)
ninja yeah yes my cut would probably (126:45 - 126:52)
be synic Quil and that's really ironic (126:52 - 127:00)
cuz I got will a syndic Quil plush for (126:57 - 127:03)
his birthday so I know how much will (127:00 - 127:07)
likes syndic Quil but I out of your list (127:03 - 127:10)
will I would take take Chespin over (127:07 - 127:15)
syndic Quil in any kind of starter sense (127:10 - 127:17)
yeah I'll give you that syndic Quil is (127:15 - 127:18)
another one that's special to me but (127:17 - 127:20)
doesn't have to be special to everybody (127:18 - 127:24)
so I can let it go I like squil so much (127:20 - 127:27)
more than Chespin but all right I I'll (127:24 - 127:29)
I'll fall in (127:27 - 127:33)
line the the the the authoritarian March (127:29 - 127:37)
of chesman rolls over another another (127:33 - 127:41)
innocent bystander was that one round of (127:37 - 127:44)
cuts or two rounds of cuts n that was (127:41 - 127:46)
two all right Micah anyone on somebody (127:44 - 127:48)
else's list that you would want to see (127:46 - 127:50)
go into into the top 10 actually before (127:48 - 127:52)
you do that let's talk about the Pokemon (127:50 - 127:55)
still up here so we have farfetch and (127:52 - 127:59)
omite on my list we have Meowth pil (127:55 - 128:01)
including chandeler and Golduck that are (127:59 - 128:03)
already on the top 10 yeah yeah so top (128:01 - 128:07)
10 so far vanilla Golduck chandeler and (128:03 - 128:10)
hucha on my list I have far-fetched and (128:07 - 128:13)
amonite Travis has Meowth pilis swine (128:10 - 128:16)
and Heracross will has Chespin Victini (128:13 - 128:20)
Volcarona and hydragon and Micah has (128:16 - 128:24)
Gengar Shen ninja gutina and AIS (128:20 - 128:26)
[Music] (128:24 - 128:29)
slash will or so sorry Micah anyone you (128:26 - 128:32)
want to see go on I would (128:29 - 128:36)
actually go for in response to the (128:32 - 128:38)
elimination of esper I would actually go (128:36 - 128:41)
for Meowth I think that Meowth is Iconic (128:38 - 128:46)
enough of a Pokemon I think that it is (128:41 - 128:49)
uh as much of a staple to the franchise (128:46 - 128:52)
as Pikachu is and I think that it's a (128:49 - 128:55)
pretty cool cat Pokemon I like the the (128:52 - 128:58)
lore behind it and I think it it (128:55 - 129:01)
deserves a spot I was going to argue (128:58 - 129:03)
against Meowth and say that Meowth is (129:01 - 129:06)
special to Travis and yeah it's cute in (129:03 - 129:11)
the cartoon but n as a Pokemon nah it's (129:06 - 129:13)
more of a marketing tool I think Meowth (129:11 - 129:16)
is real great and cleverly used in (129:13 - 129:20)
Pokemon Shuffle I think payday is (129:16 - 129:23)
something that for existing for 20 years (129:20 - 129:27)
is still unique and special to meow and (129:23 - 129:29)
I like that a lot and so I could yeah I (129:27 - 129:33)
could see Meowth going to the top 10 in (129:29 - 129:37)
will to um to change your mind to show (129:33 - 129:40)
you that Meowth is more than a Pokemon (129:37 - 129:43)
that's special to me and interesting on (129:40 - 129:45)
the show I'll argue that it it has (129:43 - 129:49)
merits uh divorced from its anime and (129:45 - 129:52)
and film portrayals it's an important (129:49 - 129:56)
Pokemon to uh an aspect of of gen one (129:52 - 129:58)
that I think a lot of people like which (129:56 - 130:01)
is this (129:58 - 130:03)
um the fact that gen one can quickly (130:01 - 130:07)
switch between this um feeling of you're (130:03 - 130:10)
sort of in a prairie with Pokemon like (130:07 - 130:13)
uh Pidgey uh to now you're in a city and (130:10 - 130:15)
you're encountering uh you're (130:13 - 130:17)
encountering mck and you're encountering (130:15 - 130:19)
Magnemite but I think most important (130:17 - 130:20)
you're encountering Meowth because (130:19 - 130:24)
Meowth is uh the Pokemon that um that (130:20 - 130:26)
steals your money this is a Pokemon that (130:24 - 130:30)
has that has adapted to uh human life (130:26 - 130:32)
and I feel like that atmosphere is very (130:30 - 130:35)
important I think that atmosphere is (130:32 - 130:36)
very different without Meowth and I (130:35 - 130:38)
think Meowth is important for that (130:36 - 130:40)
reason um again Meowth is extremely (130:38 - 130:43)
important in the anime uh to a lot of (130:40 - 130:45)
people and Meowth is really cute so (130:43 - 130:47)
there opinion not change but whatever (130:45 - 130:50)
three to one move it on (130:47 - 130:55)
on I will move it on who is who made (130:50 - 130:57)
that uh will who would you nominate for (130:55 - 131:01)
going forward yeah not on your (130:57 - 131:01)
list that's so hard um muwa Gengar I'll (131:03 - 131:13)
go with Gengar once again uh he's he's (131:10 - 131:16)
he's real cool uh he's got like strange (131:13 - 131:19)
typing that a lot of people easily (131:16 - 131:22)
forget that g what Gengar is uh his Mega (131:19 - 131:25)
Evolution is super awesome and he's (131:22 - 131:27)
another one in pokon tournament that I (131:25 - 131:29)
love to play because his ultimate or (131:27 - 131:32)
whatever you want to call it his burst (131:29 - 131:34)
basically takes you to a bizarre Gengar (131:32 - 131:36)
Dimension where he picks you up and (131:34 - 131:38)
drops him in his M drops you in his (131:36 - 131:41)
mouth and swallows you so I love Gengar (131:38 - 131:43)
and the Gengar painting in 649 monsters (131:41 - 131:45)
was possibly one of the best there (131:43 - 131:47)
Travis how do you feel about Gengar I (131:45 - 131:49)
like Gengar (131:47 - 131:53)
um I like it a lot I wouldn't be opposed (131:49 - 131:56)
to it being in the top 10 um if you had (131:53 - 131:58)
a great argument against it I'd hear it (131:56 - 132:02)
I don't have an argument against it I (131:58 - 132:05)
don't know why I'm not jumping on the (132:02 - 132:07)
let's put Gengar because we it's because (132:05 - 132:09)
we already have two gen one Pokemon and (132:07 - 132:11)
it seems strange to to load up the list (132:09 - 132:14)
like that but and also like I'm also (132:11 - 132:15)
stranged out because like my last two (132:14 - 132:18)
Pokemon are gen one Pokemon and I (132:15 - 132:19)
neither of them are making the list and (132:18 - 132:22)
we all know (132:19 - 132:22)
that uh W we'll get to those I guess uh (132:24 - 132:32)
Gengar was the original cover of the (132:29 - 132:35)
Pokemon podcast art and the purple from (132:32 - 132:37)
Gengar was important to me cuz purple (132:35 - 132:40)
was one of the primary colors I I guess (132:37 - 132:42)
we move them on I just don't feel (132:40 - 132:45)
confident about that as I felt with the (132:42 - 132:49)
first five let omite onto the top 10 (132:45 - 132:52)
I think I have I will I will have failed (132:49 - 132:55)
I think I have a really good argument (132:52 - 132:57)
for ran KN I'm sure you I'm sure you do (132:55 - 132:59)
and I'm not going to let it happen I (132:57 - 133:01)
think out I think out of all the Pokemon (132:59 - 133:04)
on my list I have the strongest argument (133:01 - 133:06)
for omite we'll get to omite when we get (133:04 - 133:09)
to omite or do we want to move Gengar (133:06 - 133:11)
onto the list yes I would I would move (133:09 - 133:13)
him down yep you haven't given me a (133:11 - 133:16)
reason to to not dingar moves down uh (133:13 - 133:18)
Travis you get a pick I'm going to (133:16 - 133:21)
nominate VII I think Victini is the (133:18 - 133:24)
point at which um the Pokemon company (133:21 - 133:26)
and game freak I I imagine Pokemon (133:24 - 133:28)
company does most of the sort of (133:26 - 133:31)
promotional distributions more than game (133:28 - 133:32)
freak I think that's where they figured (133:31 - 133:35)
out how to best distribute that type of (133:32 - 133:36)
Pokemon I know that sounds like a weird (133:35 - 133:39)
reason to say it's the top 10 um but I (133:36 - 133:40)
think Victini (133:39 - 133:43)
represents one of the coolest things (133:40 - 133:45)
about Pokemon which is that you can have (133:43 - 133:47)
something that is (133:45 - 133:50)
simultaneously um possessed by a ton of (133:47 - 133:52)
people and yet it still feels rare and (133:50 - 133:55)
special and unique even though everyone (133:52 - 133:58)
has the same thing um the the the way (133:55 - 134:00)
that Pokemon are designed the way that (133:58 - 134:02)
they're obtained um makes them feel (134:00 - 134:04)
unique to you even if that's not (134:02 - 134:06)
necessarily the case and I think Victini (134:04 - 134:09)
with its being uh distributed initially (134:06 - 134:12)
as um limited to to those people who (134:09 - 134:14)
bought it who bought the game when it (134:12 - 134:16)
came out which sounds like something (134:14 - 134:18)
that's very limiting when in reality is (134:16 - 134:21)
virtually everyone who gets the game um (134:18 - 134:24)
makes it perfect in uh communicating one (134:21 - 134:26)
of the most important experiences of a (134:24 - 134:28)
Pokemon which is making you feel like (134:26 - 134:30)
these Pokemon are yours and they're (134:28 - 134:33)
special um it's also really cute so I (134:30 - 134:35)
like it and and also just so for people (134:33 - 134:37)
who haven't played original black and (134:35 - 134:41)
white to explain beyond the fact that (134:37 - 134:42)
you know it was a limited distribution (134:41 - 134:44)
to the people who first bought black and (134:42 - 134:46)
white you didn't it wasn't a (134:44 - 134:48)
distribution just like oh you download (134:46 - 134:51)
Vic onto your cartridge what you got was (134:48 - 134:53)
a ticket for a special boat that took (134:51 - 134:56)
you to a lighthouse Island where you had (134:53 - 134:59)
to first um defeat Team Plasma who were (134:56 - 135:02)
trying to get into the lighthouse Island (134:59 - 135:04)
and then discover that the lighthous (135:02 - 135:06)
keeper had trapped Victini in his (135:04 - 135:10)
basement um to keep him safe and you (135:06 - 135:12)
actually had to battle Victini to (135:10 - 135:14)
convince him that you were good and (135:12 - 135:16)
wanted to help him and then he would (135:14 - 135:18)
become part of your team so it wasn't (135:16 - 135:20)
just a simple distribution but you (135:18 - 135:22)
actually had to earn your Victini and (135:20 - 135:23)
there's just like everything about (135:22 - 135:25)
Victini Is So Glorious because he's so (135:23 - 135:27)
cute and whatever but then you get him (135:25 - 135:29)
angry and he does a VC create at you and (135:27 - 135:32)
you understand what punishment means and (135:29 - 135:34)
I would and I would argue that I think I (135:32 - 135:36)
would I just want to get one more thing (135:34 - 135:39)
and I would also argue make a similar (135:36 - 135:41)
argument to what I said about Slurpuff (135:39 - 135:44)
that Victini I think represents a lot of (135:41 - 135:46)
the design philosophy of generation 5 (135:44 - 135:48)
generally at least in terms of its (135:46 - 135:51)
Aesthetics um so I think it's that's (135:48 - 135:53)
another reason for which it's notable (135:51 - 135:55)
because it has that um the sort of (135:53 - 135:58)
sunshiny aspect to it Micah what do you (135:55 - 136:01)
feel about Victini I am less interested (135:58 - 136:04)
in Victini than I am in celby but more (136:01 - 136:05)
interested than (136:04 - 136:09)
Gerra and in that respect I feel like (136:05 - 136:12)
it's a win I if Travis didn't nominate (136:09 - 136:16)
Victini I would have I think Victini was (136:12 - 136:20)
one of the strongest promotional Pokemon (136:16 - 136:24)
before a game came out and did nothing (136:20 - 136:27)
but good before that series dropped and (136:24 - 136:29)
has done nothing but good since well and (136:27 - 136:31)
I really like the introduction to (136:29 - 136:35)
Victini mostly because it hearkened back (136:31 - 136:40)
to a lot of the uh the event like the (136:35 - 136:42)
location based event stuff that they did (136:40 - 136:46)
in previous generations that we didn't (136:42 - 136:48)
it was either really convoluted for us (136:46 - 136:50)
or we didn't get and it was kind of cool (136:48 - 136:54)
to get that like right off the bat uh we (136:50 - 136:57)
have seven Pokemon on the top 10 vanilla (136:54 - 137:01)
gold du chandelier hucha Meowth Gengar (136:57 - 137:03)
Victini moving along there's a lot of (137:01 - 137:06)
gen one Pokemon here there's only three (137:03 - 137:09)
yeah I guess and I would say that gen (137:06 - 137:12)
one has a renewed interest with Pokémon (137:09 - 137:15)
go so I feel like yeah we have up for (137:12 - 137:18)
debate farfetch amonite (137:15 - 137:20)
pile of swine Heracross Chespin (137:18 - 137:24)
Volcarona Hy Dragon Shen ninja gutina (137:20 - 137:27)
and a of Slash I guess before we move to (137:24 - 137:31)
back to Cutthroat I have to nominate a (137:27 - 137:33)
Pokemon I (137:31 - 137:37)
don't out of this list I guess I would (137:33 - 137:43)
give you guys Shen ninja yeah yes oh (137:37 - 137:46)
really yes and I'm only saying that (137:43 - 137:49)
maybe CU you guys are so adamant about (137:46 - 137:51)
it and hopefully in the future you hear (137:49 - 137:53)
me out about the one last Pokemon I want (137:51 - 137:55)
to get on the list but well your hopes (137:53 - 137:57)
are dashed but one more thing I would (137:55 - 138:00)
say in favor of Shedinja I think part of (137:57 - 138:04)
Travis's argument against Shedinja is (138:00 - 138:08)
informed by his existing knowledge of (138:04 - 138:11)
how shinja comes about but can you (138:08 - 138:15)
imagine being a kid and you evolve your (138:11 - 138:18)
ninjas and you know all of a sudden hey (138:15 - 138:20)
wait there's this extra Pokemon on my (138:18 - 138:22)
team what happened and then you find out (138:20 - 138:24)
there's this cool shinja Pokemon there (138:22 - 138:26)
and how like wonderful and what a (138:24 - 138:28)
wondrous moment that creates for people (138:26 - 138:31)
who are unaware of how that that's how (138:28 - 138:33)
you get a Shedinja and it just (138:31 - 138:36)
appears fine put it on a list of top 10 (138:33 - 138:38)
smoke and mirrors love (138:36 - 138:42)
it top 10 magic tricks top 10 uh top 10 (138:38 - 138:44)
Vape tricks Pokemon edition love it (138:42 - 138:49)
great put it on uh I guess now we have 1 (138:44 - 138:53)
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine Pokemon nin probably (138:49 - 138:55)
would (138:53 - 138:59)
Vape uh you know there's whatever we (138:55 - 139:03)
have Lucario I'm not all right zor AR (138:59 - 139:05)
and Lucario would be Vapors way before (139:03 - 139:06)
sh ined wood let's be clear about that (139:05 - 139:08)
probably true all right we have we have (139:06 - 139:11)
two spots left if my math is correct and (139:08 - 139:15)
we have nine Pokemon left on this list I (139:11 - 139:17)
feel like whatever we've been doing for (139:15 - 139:20)
the last hour ramped up really quick (139:17 - 139:23)
yeah I I think I like every Pokemon on (139:20 - 139:25)
this list is great so hopefully our (139:23 - 139:27)
listeners don't think we're just like (139:25 - 139:30)
crapping on Pokemon because because we (139:27 - 139:32)
dislike them I mean oh I'm about to crap (139:30 - 139:35)
on omite because I dislike my night all (139:32 - 139:37)
right let's hear it I would say just as (139:35 - 139:39)
a disclaimer there (139:37 - 139:44)
are no Pokemon on this list of 40 or 39 (139:39 - 139:49)
whatever that I legitimately don't like (139:44 - 139:53)
me you you sliced lotad real quick I (139:49 - 139:55)
mean it's the one that I like the least (139:53 - 139:58)
of these there are a few Pokemon that I (139:55 - 140:00)
like actually hate of all of them that (139:58 - 140:01)
exist none of them are on this list (140:00 - 140:04)
you're saying I think that there's Merit (140:01 - 140:06)
in the majority of these but we got to (140:04 - 140:08)
get down to 10 do we want to have the (140:06 - 140:11)
omite conversation now I feel like we're (140:08 - 140:14)
gonna I mean like we could keep going is (140:11 - 140:16)
getting real real hot about we could (140:14 - 140:18)
keep going in circles but we have we (140:16 - 140:21)
have nine Pokémon left in two spots so I (140:18 - 140:25)
Omen what H Pokemon's 20 years old and (140:21 - 140:27)
Oman knite is one of the Pokemon one of (140:25 - 140:31)
the first 150 Pokemon that fit under the (140:27 - 140:35)
20year Merit it is almost old enough to (140:31 - 140:38)
rent a car a lot of Pokemon get (140:35 - 140:42)
forgotten about I would say that L Poney (140:38 - 140:44)
is one Pokemon that got completely (140:42 - 140:46)
forgotten about and I'm sure there's (140:44 - 140:48)
three listeners that are are like no i' (140:46 - 140:50)
I never forgot about low Poney but (140:48 - 140:52)
huntail is like another Pokemon that (140:50 - 140:54)
gets completely forgotten about all the (140:52 - 140:57)
time and I would argue that omite fit (140:54 - 141:00)
that fit that bill especially when it (140:57 - 141:03)
was compared to a Pokemon like Kabuto (141:00 - 141:05)
which evolves into kabo tops which is (141:03 - 141:08)
cooler than Omar I'm not arguing Omar (141:05 - 141:11)
here I'm just arguing omite Oman knite (141:08 - 141:14)
while it became this meme thing of Lord (141:11 - 141:17)
Helix Oman I didn't get any special (141:14 - 141:19)
treatment from the Pokémon company it (141:17 - 141:21)
didn't get a Mega Evolution it didn't (141:19 - 141:24)
get any promotional or advertising like (141:21 - 141:26)
Zoroark like Lucario it didn't get a (141:24 - 141:29)
Mega Evolution like Tyranitar or guard (141:26 - 141:33)
chomp Oman Knight survived 20 years and (141:29 - 141:36)
because of the community because of (141:33 - 141:38)
Twitch Plays Pokemon and other things (141:36 - 141:42)
omite became its own star it proved that (141:38 - 141:46)
after 20 years that a Pokemon that was (141:42 - 141:48)
forgotten about 20 years ago and was (141:46 - 141:51)
forgotten about for 20 years could (141:48 - 141:55)
become popular and could actually have (141:51 - 141:58)
fans be excited when they encounter in (141:55 - 142:00)
the future there is no other Pokemon (141:58 - 142:03)
that really fit that at all up to this (142:00 - 142:06)
point I think that's a fair defense but (142:03 - 142:07)
I don't think it's sufficient to make it (142:06 - 142:12)
a top 10 Pokemon and my reasons why (142:07 - 142:14)
first the fact that it was forgotten (142:12 - 142:18)
despite being um a Pokemon kind of like (142:14 - 142:21)
in a lot of ways like Shedinja it has a (142:18 - 142:24)
lot sort of special things going for the (142:21 - 142:26)
fact that it's a fossil type uh fossil (142:24 - 142:28)
type the fact that it's a fossil Pokemon (142:26 - 142:30)
that you get your choice of one of the (142:28 - 142:33)
other means that it it should have been (142:30 - 142:35)
one of the most memorable Pokemon and (142:33 - 142:38)
yet it's it's so Bland it's so (142:35 - 142:41)
unappealing uh aesthetically that it (142:38 - 142:42)
still managed to be forgotten about (142:41 - 142:44)
despite being uh one of the most (142:42 - 142:46)
mechanically interesting Pokemon at (142:44 - 142:47)
least in terms of how you get it is (142:46 - 142:49)
telling about how poor the design of the (142:47 - 142:53)
Pokemon is second I would argue that um (142:49 - 142:55)
your point about that its popularity was (142:53 - 143:00)
revived is has it has a fatal flaw in (142:55 - 143:03)
that the the the thing that was that was (143:00 - 143:05)
funny and and and cool about the meme (143:03 - 143:07)
wasn't about the Pokemon Omen I it was (143:05 - 143:10)
about the fossil before it no one thinks (143:07 - 143:12)
no one thinks praise omite they think (143:10 - 143:14)
praise Helix right like like that's the (143:12 - 143:16)
thing that's been revived that's the (143:14 - 143:20)
Obscure thing um about gen one that was (143:16 - 143:22)
revived through Twitch Plays Pokemon not (143:20 - 143:25)
omite in and of itself I think you would (143:22 - 143:28)
find most people if you ask a lot of (143:25 - 143:31)
people what does a lot I would say that (143:28 - 143:32)
the fact that there are people out there (143:31 - 143:35)
who know the Helix Fossil but can't (143:32 - 143:37)
remember the name of the Pokemon that it (143:35 - 143:39)
it it develops into which I mean I can't (143:37 - 143:41)
prove to you that those people exist but (143:39 - 143:44)
they probably do um the fact that they (143:41 - 143:46)
might exist I think is also telling (143:44 - 143:48)
about the insignificance of romanite and (143:46 - 143:51)
then I would argue that even if I'm (143:48 - 143:53)
willing to concede that a the fact that (143:51 - 143:56)
it fell out of existence um originally (143:53 - 143:58)
isn't enough to show that it doesn't (143:56 - 144:00)
deserve to be on this list and B that (143:58 - 144:02)
it's not even the most um Salient thing (144:00 - 144:05)
about that Meme about its Revival even (144:02 - 144:07)
if you're even if you if somehow both of (144:05 - 144:10)
those arguments are are are taken down I (144:07 - 144:13)
would say that if Grant even if I grant (144:10 - 144:15)
your complete story that that it's (144:13 - 144:16)
beautiful that this PO Pokemon was (144:15 - 144:18)
revived in terms of the public (144:16 - 144:20)
Consciousness that says next to nothing (144:18 - 144:23)
about the Pokemon itself um it says more (144:20 - 144:25)
about the community of Pokemon it says (144:23 - 144:26)
more about the fan base that developed (144:25 - 144:29)
around this sort of um auxiliary twitch (144:26 - 144:32)
BLS Pokemon fandom um than it does about (144:29 - 144:34)
the Pokemon itself and none of those (144:32 - 144:37)
people are liking omite for omite they (144:34 - 144:39)
like omite because of the strange Ludo (144:37 - 144:40)
narrative that's built around it which I (144:39 - 144:42)
don't think really says anything about (144:40 - 144:44)
the Pokémon I don't think even all of (144:42 - 144:46)
this attention gives om any sort of (144:44 - 144:48)
personality (144:46 - 144:50)
despite all of the people trying to (144:48 - 144:53)
apply a personality to it all I will add (144:50 - 144:56)
to Travis's fantastic arguments are you (144:53 - 144:57)
would have had more luck with bur Jesus (144:56 - 145:01)
brother I agree I think I think no I (144:57 - 145:04)
mean you look at I I would argue that (145:01 - 145:07)
all the all six Pokemon in Twitch Plays (145:04 - 145:10)
Pokemon matters there are a ton of (145:07 - 145:12)
people that would say Twitch Plays (145:10 - 145:14)
Pokemon was stupid it was just a fad it (145:12 - 145:17)
didn't matter but it did like Twitch (145:14 - 145:20)
Plays Pokemon is just as important as (145:17 - 145:23)
Pokémon go just as important as any (145:20 - 145:25)
other Pokemon event there were a lot of (145:23 - 145:27)
people that were super against Twitch (145:25 - 145:30)
Plays Pokemon like Kenny he hated it and (145:27 - 145:32)
that's fine I'm not saying that you (145:30 - 145:35)
needed to like Twitch Plays Pokemon but (145:32 - 145:37)
Twitch Plays Pokemon was one of the most (145:35 - 145:41)
important things that mattered for (145:37 - 145:44)
Pokemon and the Pokemon community that (145:41 - 145:46)
being said those out of those six (145:44 - 145:49)
Pokemon that lasted to the end a lot of (145:46 - 145:51)
Pokemon got released and a lot of (145:49 - 145:56)
accidents happened but the Helix Fossil (145:51 - 145:58)
was there from the beginning well since (145:56 - 146:01)
Mount Moon and made it all the way to (145:58 - 146:04)
the end they were able to take it to the (146:01 - 146:07)
research Factory actually evolve it get (146:04 - 146:11)
it train it take it to the Elite 4 and I (146:07 - 146:14)
could maybe make that argument for bird (146:11 - 146:19)
Jesus or neoc King or any or Lapras or (146:14 - 146:21)
any of the other Pokémon but those (146:19 - 146:23)
Pokemon already had a pretty good (146:21 - 146:25)
following like a lot of people know (146:23 - 146:28)
pidot a lot of people know Lapras and (146:25 - 146:31)
omite was forgotten about and a lot of (146:28 - 146:34)
Pokemon there's 700 now a lot of Pokemon (146:31 - 146:37)
are forgotten about and Mega Evolutions (146:34 - 146:39)
and certain promotions help those (146:37 - 146:43)
Pokemon stand out and amanite if it (146:39 - 146:45)
wasn't for Twitch Plays Pokemon amonite (146:43 - 146:48)
would still be the hunt of gen one it (146:45 - 146:51)
would still be forgotten and now you see (146:48 - 146:53)
that like even in Pokemon center.com (146:51 - 146:56)
amanite has its own pin you don't see a (146:53 - 146:59)
pin for huntail you don't see a pin for (146:56 - 147:02)
Loney and Loney got the mega treatment (146:59 - 147:06)
and it's still like not as vital as (147:02 - 147:08)
omite has become I would argue that (147:06 - 147:10)
omite is no longer vital that that (147:08 - 147:12)
anyone who that at one point it was (147:10 - 147:14)
vital and but that the type of (147:12 - 147:16)
resurgence that Twitch Plays Pokemon (147:14 - 147:18)
gave it was more a flash in the pan than (147:16 - 147:22)
a than a rur than than an enduring uh (147:18 - 147:25)
Vitality that that I mean when I think (147:22 - 147:27)
of omen I mean I wasn't the hugest fan (147:25 - 147:28)
of trules Pokemon I liked it I thought (147:27 - 147:30)
it was interesting um but I wasn't as (147:28 - 147:33)
big of a fan as you for example but when (147:30 - 147:35)
I think of omite I think of a stale meme (147:33 - 147:36)
I don't even think about the Pokemon (147:35 - 147:39)
anymore I think twitch BLS Pokemon did (147:36 - 147:41)
more detriment to omite as a Pokemon (147:39 - 147:43)
than it did uh benefit and I think it (147:41 - 147:46)
leaves the Pokemon um worse than (147:43 - 147:48)
forgotten and it's it's annoying to (147:46 - 147:50)
think about for me and I think of a lot (147:48 - 147:52)
of other people because it just was this (147:50 - 147:54)
this meme that was repeated so often um (147:52 - 147:58)
and became uh grading to hear and if (147:54 - 148:00)
anybody loves memes it's me and (147:58 - 148:02)
Travis if we don't like this meme that (148:00 - 148:04)
says a lot that's a bad meeme I mean (148:02 - 148:07)
most of my I personally my my reaction (148:04 - 148:10)
to that is immediately that I feel like (148:07 - 148:13)
labeling something a meme has become a (148:10 - 148:16)
meme in itself as a rebuttal to (148:13 - 148:17)
something that a of people have an (148:16 - 148:19)
interest in but a small group of people (148:17 - 148:22)
don't and I feel like the amount of (148:19 - 148:24)
interest that is put into omite through (148:22 - 148:25)
through the course of the interest that (148:24 - 148:28)
was gained in Twitch Plays Pokemon (148:25 - 148:30)
regardless of what you want to call it (148:28 - 148:32)
it was interest nonetheless and it was (148:30 - 148:35)
interest that a lot of people had yeah (148:32 - 148:36)
but you're using past tense and I think (148:35 - 148:39)
that's telling that that that interest (148:36 - 148:42)
is gone with Pokemon go now I I mean (148:39 - 148:44)
I've been out I've been out with Micah (148:42 - 148:46)
there there were 400 people in one place (148:44 - 148:48)
of Milwaukee playing Pokémon go and I (148:46 - 148:52)
can tell you that 90% of them have had (148:48 - 148:54)
zero interest in Pokemon before Pokémon (148:52 - 148:56)
go but I can tell you one thing I (148:54 - 148:58)
guarantee you that the 90% of those (148:56 - 149:01)
people know omite just like they know (148:58 - 149:03)
Charmander just like they know Squirtle (149:01 - 149:05)
just like they know Bulbasaur you know (149:03 - 149:07)
what they probably don't know farfetch (149:05 - 149:09)
and farfetch is one of my favorite (149:07 - 149:12)
Pokemon but I think that farfetch in (149:09 - 149:14)
itself like I would cut farfetch right (149:12 - 149:16)
now and just keep omite and a lot of (149:14 - 149:18)
people they know that farfetch is one of (149:16 - 149:20)
my top favorite Pokemon that's why it (149:18 - 149:23)
was in D and D but that goes to my (149:20 - 149:26)
original point of like farfetch hasn't (149:23 - 149:29)
gotten any special treatment it's it (149:26 - 149:30)
probably never will get special (149:29 - 149:32)
treatment it will never get a Mega (149:30 - 149:35)
Evolution and Omar will probably never (149:32 - 149:37)
get a Mega Evolution that's fine but (149:35 - 149:41)
amanite did that on its own 20 years (149:37 - 149:43)
later it didn't do it on its own it had (149:41 - 149:44)
a it had a (149:43 - 149:48)
huge artificial Boost from from this um (149:44 - 149:49)
from this Twitch Plays Pokemon (149:48 - 149:51)
phenomenon that yeah from the community (149:49 - 149:53)
and like everything about Pokemon is (149:51 - 149:56)
community like Pokémon go is a terrible (149:53 - 149:57)
game if you're just playing it by (149:56 - 149:59)
yourself the best part about Pokemon go (149:57 - 150:01)
is going to Lake Park in Milwaukee and (149:59 - 150:04)
seeing 400 other people play Pokemon go (150:01 - 150:06)
like no one in Twitch Plays Pokemon (150:04 - 150:08)
started that game and went we need to (150:06 - 150:11)
get the Helix Fossil like that is the (150:08 - 150:13)
preferred foxel it was an accident and (150:11 - 150:16)
everyone accepted that and omite went on (150:13 - 150:20)
that journey and became a became a meme (150:16 - 150:22)
yeah but like what Pokemon isn't a meme (150:20 - 150:24)
at this point I think it's a beautiful (150:22 - 150:27)
story I think it is I think it it's it's (150:24 - 150:29)
uh I think you're correct that it that (150:27 - 150:31)
the community is extremely important to (150:29 - 150:34)
Pokemon I don't think that that is the (150:31 - 150:36)
Pokemon Community I think that it that (150:34 - 150:39)
the that Twitch Plays Pokemon was was (150:36 - 150:43)
wildly popular but uh it was not even (150:39 - 150:45)
close to the overall community of (150:43 - 150:47)
Pokemon which is much much larger than (150:45 - 150:49)
it and if we're going to pick something (150:47 - 150:51)
that highlights the Pokémon Community we (150:49 - 150:53)
don't pick something that that's that's (150:51 - 150:55)
a highlight of a strange subset of it (150:53 - 150:57)
that that not (150:55 - 150:59)
everyone even enjoyed like like if we're (150:57 - 151:03)
going to to pick a Pokemon that was an (150:59 - 151:06)
underdog that the the community rallied (151:03 - 151:07)
around and really liked then we wouldn't (151:06 - 151:09)
have knocked out esper we've already (151:07 - 151:13)
knocked out esper and uh an omite is is (151:09 - 151:16)
an example of a smaller strange Niche (151:13 - 151:17)
that doesn't represent the overall (151:16 - 151:19)
Pokémon community and I think putting it (151:17 - 151:22)
on the list would frankly be not a uh (151:19 - 151:24)
glorification of the Pokemon community (151:22 - 151:27)
and what Pokemon can do to revitalize (151:24 - 151:31)
interest but but just a a glorification (151:27 - 151:34)
of a phenomenon that was at best (151:31 - 151:36)
tangential to Pokemon and what it means (151:34 - 151:40)
I not still not ready to cut it cut it (151:36 - 151:42)
omite has to go (151:40 - 151:46)
Micah I have I'm having a really hard (151:42 - 151:47)
time agreeing (151:46 - 151:50)
with the opposing arguments and I feel (151:47 - 151:54)
like I'm still in support of omite all (151:50 - 151:57)
right I mean we can keep debating omite (151:54 - 151:59)
but let's there's two it's two verse two (151:57 - 152:01)
let's move on to another (151:59 - 152:03)
Pokemon thought yeah there would be such (152:01 - 152:07)
a hot debate for omite my goodness yeah (152:03 - 152:08)
exactly because it's terrible and it (152:07 - 152:09)
shouldn't be on this list the fact that (152:08 - 152:11)
you think the fact that you're surprised (152:09 - 152:12)
that there was a hot debate about it (152:11 - 152:13)
means that you already can see that it's (152:12 - 152:15)
that it has no place I mean there's (152:13 - 152:17)
there's three on the final list that I (152:15 - 152:19)
would be I would go back and cut I would (152:17 - 152:21)
cut shinja I would cut Gengar I would (152:19 - 152:24)
cut Meowth I'm just I'm just saying like (152:21 - 152:26)
we don't all have to how did sh how did (152:24 - 152:29)
shinja get on the list didn't we cuz I (152:26 - 152:31)
had to pick one part of I had to pick (152:29 - 152:33)
one that wasn't my other Pokemon so I (152:31 - 152:35)
picked Shen (152:33 - 152:35)
ninja what we what are we doing what (152:39 - 152:44)
well that was omite was open discussion (152:42 - 152:46)
so let's openly discuss another Pokemon (152:44 - 152:49)
I I guess I I I'll start it Heracross (152:46 - 152:54)
can go yeah Heracross is uh hot garbage (152:49 - 152:56)
in the trash everybody knows Piner is (152:54 - 153:00)
better Pinsir is better in every (152:56 - 153:00)
way I want to (153:00 - 153:05)
hear I mean I I'll say off the bat that (153:02 - 153:07)
I don't have like a great supporting (153:05 - 153:10)
argument for it but I do have uh fond (153:07 - 153:13)
memory of Heracross or just fond (153:10 - 153:15)
memories in general of when they were (153:13 - 153:17)
debuting (153:15 - 153:19)
Gen 2 and a lot of it was coming out (153:17 - 153:21)
through other means like the show and (153:19 - 153:24)
things like that before we actually got (153:21 - 153:26)
them in the game or that before we (153:24 - 153:28)
actually got the games at least in the (153:26 - 153:32)
US and that was one of the few first gen (153:28 - 153:34)
2 Pokemon that I (153:32 - 153:36)
saw uh without actually seeing them in (153:34 - 153:39)
the game and it was pretty exciting but (153:36 - 153:41)
aside from that I don't have any like (153:39 - 153:44)
real love loss for Heracross it'd be an (153:41 - 153:47)
uphill battle and Heracross is was like (153:44 - 153:49)
number nine on my list or something I'm (153:47 - 153:52)
fine with taking it off all right are we (153:49 - 153:54)
just at this point just argue like yeah (153:52 - 153:56)
we're just it's all open discussion (153:54 - 153:59)
gutina can go gutina is (153:56 - 154:02)
just old school you know I think of (153:59 - 154:06)
gutina and I think oh my God that thing (154:02 - 154:08)
is going to be so annoying to knock out (154:06 - 154:09)
like that is the first thing I think (154:08 - 154:12)
about gutina about how annoying it is to (154:09 - 154:15)
deal with battling and the fact that I (154:12 - 154:18)
think about battles before I think about (154:15 - 154:19)
anything else about the Pokémon despite (154:18 - 154:21)
all they try to do with the Distortion (154:19 - 154:24)
world and all of the you know it's it's (154:21 - 154:28)
about like um void and and like and (154:24 - 154:30)
other dimensions and yet I don't even (154:28 - 154:31)
think about those things and I just (154:30 - 154:34)
think that it's ugly and um annoying to (154:31 - 154:36)
deal with means that it it's a failure (154:34 - 154:39)
in my opinion and it's the Pokemon devil (154:36 - 154:43)
so go it's it to me it's there's a lot (154:39 - 154:46)
of uh personal interest that I have in (154:43 - 154:50)
it mostly because it it is inspired by a (154:46 - 154:54)
lot of the things that I like you know (154:50 - 154:57)
things in pop culture that I've been a (154:54 - 155:01)
big fan of um yeah it representing the (154:57 - 155:03)
other world or the upside down or you (155:01 - 155:06)
know and and I like it a lot for that (155:03 - 155:07)
specifically but for other things as (155:06 - 155:12)
well like the you know its abilities to (155:07 - 155:14)
go through the other world through (155:12 - 155:17)
Reflections and things like that and I I (155:14 - 155:19)
if it's not clear from my list I like (155:17 - 155:22)
Ghost Pokemon a lot which I didn't (155:19 - 155:24)
really realize until I was writing this (155:22 - 155:28)
list but I do like that it's uh it's a (155:24 - 155:30)
ghost dragon like that's that's pretty (155:28 - 155:33)
cool to me but I it's not something that (155:30 - 155:35)
I'm I feel like I could really defend (155:33 - 155:38)
enough yeah I would not be heartbroken (155:35 - 155:40)
if it didn't make it I think gutina was (155:38 - 155:44)
the opposite of rcus and didn't do a (155:40 - 155:46)
good enough job being the opposite I (155:44 - 155:48)
would argue though and this is probably (155:46 - 155:50)
going to start a different debate which (155:48 - 155:52)
we can maybe have at a different time (155:50 - 155:57)
that gutina of the uh front of thee box (155:52 - 156:00)
Pokemon is probably one of the coolest (155:57 - 156:05)
oh no FR and we don't have time for this (156:00 - 156:09)
debate and are cooler ho and ho and (156:05 - 156:11)
Lugia are (156:09 - 156:16)
cooler e is cool xerus is cooler this is (156:11 - 156:16)
the wor (156:16 - 156:20)
I think we cut Chespin the no other (156:16 - 156:23)
starter has made the list I don't get (156:20 - 156:26)
why Chespin Chespin can go just I I I (156:23 - 156:28)
think Chespin is a great representation (156:26 - 156:31)
of what you want in a starter Pokemon (156:28 - 156:33)
because it is very clearly like your (156:31 - 156:35)
friend and (156:33 - 156:38)
companion and you know it's not a pet (156:35 - 156:40)
it's you know it's bip pedal it it's (156:38 - 156:42)
just like a cute little buddy to have (156:40 - 156:44)
with you and I think that's why a lot of (156:42 - 156:46)
people love Chespin but I'm okay to let (156:44 - 156:48)
go in comparison to other things here (156:46 - 156:51)
all right we got Farfesh amonite pilos (156:48 - 156:54)
swine Volcarona Hy Dragon AIS slash (156:51 - 156:56)
Travis seli on Piloswine I'm surprised (156:54 - 156:59)
it's still it was never argued I'm (156:56 - 157:02)
surprised it still hadn't been brought (156:59 - 157:05)
up um pilot swne is my favorite Pokemon (157:02 - 157:10)
for a few reasons um one I think it is a (157:05 - 157:14)
uh great example of how you can build a (157:10 - 157:17)
Pokemon around its typing that you can (157:14 - 157:19)
take ice and ground these things that (157:17 - 157:22)
that don't seem to fit together in any (157:19 - 157:24)
way and then think well uh Willie (157:22 - 157:27)
Mammoth or or or those types of of (157:24 - 157:31)
creatures are sort of evocative of both (157:27 - 157:32)
ground and Ice the fact that they were (157:31 - 157:34)
alive in the Ice Age um and the these (157:32 - 157:38)
sort of uh Brown Mamon hulking things (157:34 - 157:40)
and yet you know you take these two (157:38 - 157:42)
concepts you mash them together uh and (157:40 - 157:45)
then you figure out how to build the (157:42 - 157:46)
design out of that and I feel like (157:45 - 157:49)
that's uh what a lot of Pokemon are and (157:46 - 157:52)
Piloswine um is a great example um and I (157:49 - 157:54)
would say one of the coolest Piloswine (157:52 - 157:58)
is also one of the best uh second stage (157:54 - 157:59)
in my opinion one of the coolest second (157:58 - 158:02)
stage evolution Pokemon um a stage that (157:59 - 158:05)
often gets forgotten because the second (158:02 - 158:09)
stage is so often um something that is (158:05 - 158:12)
purely a transitional period And the (158:09 - 158:14)
fact that pilos swine was originally the (158:12 - 158:16)
final evolution until Gen 4 introduced (158:14 - 158:18)
Mamoswine means that the whole swin up (158:16 - 158:20)
to Manos swine with Piloswine in the (158:18 - 158:22)
middle line um each of them has its (158:20 - 158:25)
distinct personality uh with pile of (158:22 - 158:28)
swine being very different from its um (158:25 - 158:31)
predecessor and um and what and and (158:28 - 158:36)
mamos Swine um in that it has the the (158:31 - 158:42)
type of uh appeal of a Pokemon that um (158:36 - 158:43)
that doesn't seem that it's not outward (158:42 - 158:46)
facing it's not like a it's not like a (158:43 - 158:48)
uh cute Pokémon that's like looking out (158:46 - 158:51)
and it's like its design is not meant to (158:48 - 158:53)
make you think it's cute its design is (158:51 - 158:56)
in the world it it feels like an animal (158:53 - 158:58)
that that is indifferent to you and the (158:56 - 159:00)
fact that it's one a few Pokemon that (158:58 - 159:03)
feels like that is very cool um and I (159:00 - 159:05)
feel like it's a Pokemon that you can (159:03 - 159:08)
learn to love a lot I certainly have and (159:05 - 159:09)
I feel like that's a lot of what makes a (159:08 - 159:11)
Pokemon good is that you learn to love (159:09 - 159:13)
it over time pilot swine's a perfect (159:11 - 159:15)
example of that because it doesn't try (159:13 - 159:17)
to make you like it from the beginning (159:15 - 159:18)
yeah still think it's very idios (159:17 - 159:22)
syncratic to Travis Micah I have never (159:18 - 159:25)
had any real interest in P wi I knew I (159:22 - 159:27)
wasn't winning that one but I had it's (159:25 - 159:29)
my favorite Pokemon it was a great (159:27 - 159:32)
defense it was a really solid I still (159:29 - 159:34)
I'm not on the pile of swine bandwagon (159:32 - 159:37)
but a fun story for our listeners is (159:34 - 159:39)
when Travis initially emailed me he (159:37 - 159:41)
spelled pile of swine wrong yeah and (159:39 - 159:43)
it's really (159:41 - 159:45)
embarrassing I spelled it as pillow (159:43 - 159:46)
swine (159:45 - 159:48)
which is the which is the cardinal sin (159:46 - 159:53)
no that that email that you sent is like (159:48 - 159:56)
one of the most adorable things in the (159:53 - 159:57)
world yeah we'll have to read it on the (159:56 - 159:59)
show and I'll be embarrassed or whatever (159:57 - 160:02)
it's super adorable it was it's like I (159:59 - 160:05)
was like 17 or something 16 17 yeah you (160:02 - 160:07)
were pretty young I mean I was young too (160:05 - 160:09)
and I was I was I was dumb I'm still (160:07 - 160:14)
dumb but it it it's such a good moment (160:09 - 160:17)
in history of how much this show has (160:14 - 160:20)
grown yeah I was a super fan of this (160:17 - 160:24)
show and look where you are now debating (160:20 - 160:27)
amit's existed getting furious at you (160:24 - 160:29)
you think amanite is one of the 10 best (160:27 - 160:31)
Pokemon of all time or that it (160:29 - 160:33)
represents the Pokemon community that is (160:31 - 160:36)
insulting to me strangely enough I've (160:33 - 160:39)
never enjoyed this program at all wow uh (160:36 - 160:42)
my favorite was when I was on an episode (160:39 - 160:44)
for the first time and I asked will if (160:42 - 160:46)
he had heard it and I asked his opinion (160:44 - 160:48)
and he said I don't listen to any (160:46 - 160:50)
episode that I'm not (160:48 - 160:52)
on (160:50 - 160:54)
lie uh I think you should all listen to (160:52 - 160:56)
the episodes you're on because it makes (160:54 - 160:59)
you better podcasters or at least I hope (160:56 - 161:01)
that I have become a better (160:59 - 161:05)
podcaster let's talk about age of Slash (161:01 - 161:08)
why why is this Pokemon still here well (161:05 - 161:10)
I I feel age of Slash is transformative (161:08 - 161:12)
I think it's it's just an incredible (161:10 - 161:14)
well besides the fact that it actually (161:12 - 161:16)
literally does transform between its (161:14 - 161:18)
attack form and its Defense form during (161:16 - 161:20)
battle based on the type of move that (161:18 - 161:22)
you're about to use or that you've just (161:20 - 161:26)
used uh I I just think that unique and (161:22 - 161:31)
special uh aspect to it um is a real (161:26 - 161:34)
sort of setting stone for what can be (161:31 - 161:38)
done to keep Pokemon interesting and to (161:34 - 161:40)
sort of set a foundation for what can (161:38 - 161:41)
happen in the future if they keep up (161:40 - 161:43)
with that type of creativity so it's (161:41 - 161:46)
both an enjoyable uh and beautiful (161:43 - 161:49)
Pokemon to have on your team but also (161:46 - 161:52)
you know it it it works in competitive (161:49 - 161:54)
you know that it it actually you know (161:52 - 161:56)
you can have it on a competitive team (161:54 - 161:59)
and survive and do good work with an (161:56 - 162:01)
Maes slash they're they're really hard (161:59 - 162:02)
to work against unless you really know (162:01 - 162:06)
what you're doing um so I would uh I I (162:02 - 162:09)
yeah I really like AIS slash a lot but I (162:06 - 162:11)
also have a a pension for Ghost Pokemon (162:09 - 162:15)
as does MGA I don't like AIS slash as I (162:11 - 162:17)
mean I like slash but I don't feel like (162:15 - 162:19)
it fits in the top 10 first because (162:17 - 162:21)
aesthetically I think it it's a very (162:19 - 162:24)
busy design um there's so many loops and (162:21 - 162:28)
circles that it's um uh that it that it (162:24 - 162:31)
hurts the eyes a little bit second I (162:28 - 162:34)
think I think that while there is some (162:31 - 162:36)
validity to Will's argument in favor of (162:34 - 162:39)
it that um the uniqueness of how it (162:36 - 162:43)
operates is um a potential for where the (162:39 - 162:46)
game can evolve in the future I don't (162:43 - 162:51)
necessarily think that it is a while it (162:46 - 162:53)
is a possibility of where to go I don't (162:51 - 162:54)
think it's a I don't think it's a great (162:53 - 162:56)
choice to do that I don't think making (162:54 - 162:59)
the game more complicated uh I think it (162:56 - 163:02)
is I think that's rarely a good choice (162:59 - 163:04)
uh especially if it's just making the (163:02 - 163:07)
game more complicated for one Pokemon's (163:04 - 163:12)
sake because it it purely becomes a if (163:07 - 163:14)
you as a player remember how this (163:12 - 163:17)
Pokemon operates then you will be more (163:14 - 163:19)
successful as opposed to introducing a (163:17 - 163:21)
mechanic that makes playing the game (163:19 - 163:23)
more fun it doesn't make playing the (163:21 - 163:26)
game more fun unless you are in one of (163:23 - 163:27)
the few circumstances where you're (163:26 - 163:30)
playing with or against an AES slash and (163:27 - 163:32)
I think that's um a worthless (163:30 - 163:34)
complication to something that has (163:32 - 163:36)
little to no impact overall if you want (163:34 - 163:38)
to make the game more interesting going (163:36 - 163:41)
down the line you make larger changes to (163:38 - 163:44)
to the game play or or or or larger (163:41 - 163:46)
streamlined (163:44 - 163:48)
streamlining to the gameplay to make it (163:46 - 163:52)
more elegant um or to um to make it a (163:48 - 163:53)
better experience and I don't think (163:52 - 163:56)
making one complicated Pokemon uh is at (163:53 - 163:58)
all a great step forward in making the (163:56 - 164:01)
game better I think I think that the (163:58 - 164:05)
it's it's it's like a like a low low (164:01 - 164:08)
like a softer form of presenting (164:05 - 164:12)
different forms in a situation like (164:08 - 164:16)
combat where nothing else really (164:12 - 164:20)
has that kind of mechanic where it it (164:16 - 164:22)
actively changes in combat based on what (164:20 - 164:27)
it's doing and I think that that like (164:22 - 164:31)
will is saying is potential for making (164:27 - 164:34)
battle more interesting rather than just (164:31 - 164:36)
look like visually interesting rather (164:34 - 164:38)
than just looking at some static (164:36 - 164:40)
creatures staring at each other until (164:38 - 164:42)
one of them does something even beyond (164:40 - 164:46)
that there are lots of things about AG (164:42 - 164:49)
of Slash that I personally in love with (164:46 - 164:53)
it next to Gengar is my favorite Pokemon (164:49 - 164:56)
and the reason for that is because it's (164:53 - 164:59)
it's just it's the perfect storm for me (164:56 - 165:04)
of what it's based on and what it does (164:59 - 165:08)
that it's so far up my alley that it's (165:04 - 165:11)
it's parked in the driveway it's just (165:08 - 165:13)
such a like the the idea that it's based (165:11 - 165:16)
a lot on Xcalibur and Sword and the (165:13 - 165:19)
stone and that it has this ability to (165:16 - 165:22)
determine who is destined to be king (165:19 - 165:24)
based on their qualities and things like (165:22 - 165:27)
that I am a very big fan of fantasy low (165:24 - 165:29)
and high fantasy and Aran Legends and (165:27 - 165:31)
stuff like that if anybody who's if (165:29 - 165:34)
anybody's seen my twitch Channel then (165:31 - 165:37)
they know 100% that that's the case I (165:34 - 165:38)
grew up with a lot of Dungeons and (165:37 - 165:40)
Dragons and Magic the Gathering and like (165:38 - 165:42)
high fantasy stuff and I've grown to (165:40 - 165:44)
love a lot of low fantasy stuff too and (165:42 - 165:47)
I really like that this (165:44 - 165:51)
combines that those interests with a (165:47 - 165:54)
pre-existing interest in Pokemon and on (165:51 - 165:57)
top of that it's a ghost type it's uh (165:54 - 165:59)
you know it does really interesting (165:57 - 166:02)
things in battle I think just generally (165:59 - 166:04)
I I'm in love with it before your (166:02 - 166:07)
argument I would have been a hard no on (166:04 - 166:09)
AG of Slash but your argument was really (166:07 - 166:13)
good and strong first think that somehow (166:09 - 166:17)
you have gotten the most pokemon on the (166:13 - 166:20)
list from your picks if I mean I wasn't (166:17 - 166:23)
going to say anything if we minus our (166:20 - 166:26)
our tie of chandelier you have three (166:23 - 166:30)
will and I have one Travis has two uh (166:26 - 166:33)
that being said I think a of Slash is a (166:30 - 166:35)
complicated design I think it's (166:33 - 166:38)
complicated in battle I think honed is a (166:35 - 166:41)
stronger representation of that line uh (166:38 - 166:45)
dualblade is garbage but your argument (166:41 - 166:47)
your argument for AIS slash is super (166:45 - 166:50)
good and I respect that and I want to (166:47 - 166:52)
agree with you but at the same time I (166:50 - 166:56)
feel like you and will also agreed on (166:52 - 166:59)
Shen ninja and Travis and I were against (166:56 - 167:01)
Chen ninja and you and will agreed on a (166:59 - 167:04)
of Slash and I think the AG of Slash (167:01 - 167:06)
argument and technically Travis and I (167:04 - 167:08)
are against a of Slash I think the AG of (167:06 - 167:11)
Slash argument far surpasses any (167:08 - 167:13)
argument you had for shinja and I feel (167:11 - 167:15)
like Shen ninja should be removed and a (167:13 - 167:17)
slash should be replaced with it if (167:15 - 167:20)
that's the motion I will I would be if (167:17 - 167:22)
if that's if that's what happens I'd be (167:20 - 167:24)
fine with removing shinja in favor of (167:22 - 167:26)
AIS slash I think AIS slash is better (167:24 - 167:29)
than shinja I'm okay with that will I'm (167:26 - 167:31)
not okay with that but uh that's three (167:29 - 167:35)
against one so the upset AE of Slash (167:31 - 167:37)
makes it the (167:35 - 167:39)
upset (167:37 - 167:42)
uh what a turnaround all right so pretty (167:39 - 167:46)
much Micah has rest in peace one gimmick (167:42 - 167:48)
Pokemon at least be the cooler one (167:46 - 167:51)
they're all gimmicks they're all (167:48 - 167:53)
gimmicks all right we have have one (167:51 - 167:54)
mechanical gimmick Pokemon at least that (167:53 - 167:56)
would be the cooler one four we still (167:54 - 167:58)
have eight we have four Pokemon left (167:56 - 168:02)
farfetch amanite vona Hy Dragon I'm (167:58 - 168:04)
willing to cut farfetched to make omite (168:02 - 168:07)
work no farfetched is your better choice (168:04 - 168:09)
uh a farfetched is your better choice (168:07 - 168:12)
omite never be on this list I would (168:09 - 168:14)
argue that too as much as I argued in (168:12 - 168:15)
favor of omite I would argue that (168:14 - 168:18)
farfetched is a better choice for this (168:15 - 168:21)
list Oma Knight especially because it (168:18 - 168:26)
has significance to the show yes totally (168:21 - 168:27)
and I would love both to be on the list (168:26 - 168:29)
but I know Wills will fight very hard (168:27 - 168:32)
for either Volcarona or Hy dragon that (168:29 - 168:36)
being said even if you ignored the (168:32 - 168:38)
success that omite got from Twitch Plays (168:36 - 168:40)
Pokemon and just look at (168:38 - 168:42)
amanite (168:40 - 168:45)
being relevant again that's you can't (168:42 - 168:47)
you can't ignore what made it relevant (168:45 - 168:50)
and focus that it's no the focus on it (168:47 - 168:52)
as being relevant that doesn't make any (168:50 - 168:53)
sense you can't divorce the point I'm (168:52 - 168:56)
making is that (168:53 - 169:02)
omite proves that a Pokemon can become (168:56 - 169:06)
popular even after so many years and (169:02 - 169:09)
Pokemon not giving it special treatment (169:06 - 169:11)
but it it's the fact that it's popular (169:09 - 169:13)
among people that probably haven't (169:11 - 169:15)
played against a group of people that as (169:13 - 169:17)
a whole probably haven't played more (169:15 - 169:19)
than the first set of games a group of (169:17 - 169:20)
people that probably (169:19 - 169:23)
are I mean Mah M and I are hardcore (169:20 - 169:25)
Pokemon fans and we watched Twitch Plays (169:23 - 169:27)
Pokemon from start to finish I think a (169:25 - 169:29)
lot I I did I mean I did too but but I (169:27 - 169:32)
think that I think that that I think (169:29 - 169:34)
what you're arguing is that the majority (169:32 - 169:36)
of the people who watched it were not (169:34 - 169:38)
people that our fans like Steve and I (169:36 - 169:41)
are right and I think and I think that (169:38 - 169:43)
majority looks down upon those of us who (169:41 - 169:46)
actually uh play through the rest of the (169:43 - 169:50)
game and and and a lot of them are the (169:46 - 169:53)
the like the Gen one or type that that (169:50 - 169:56)
are sort of not open-minded to the fact (169:53 - 169:58)
that the game has improved over time and (169:56 - 170:00)
I think if we're going to say omite is (169:58 - 170:01)
one of the best Pokemon you're (170:00 - 170:04)
validating at uh if your argument is (170:01 - 170:06)
that omite is an example of how the (170:04 - 170:09)
community can build a Pokemon up from (170:06 - 170:12)
obscurity that is not the Pokemon fan (170:09 - 170:14)
Community that's that's a a separate (170:12 - 170:16)
entity Al together (170:14 - 170:18)
I farfetch is a better Pokemon I think (170:16 - 170:21)
that that that does speak for something (170:18 - 170:23)
like Po like Pokemon go wouldn't be as (170:21 - 170:26)
successful with just hardcore Pokemon (170:23 - 170:30)
players I think that the community know (170:26 - 170:32)
that our listeners know that I love (170:30 - 170:34)
farfetch and farfetch is a great Pokemon (170:32 - 170:36)
and hopefully one day farfetch would get (170:34 - 170:39)
a Mega Evolution to you know build and (170:36 - 170:40)
give it that relevance again but at the (170:39 - 170:43)
same time besides being a duck with a (170:40 - 170:46)
leak I can't tell you why farfetch is (170:43 - 170:49)
good farfetch besides being a Pokemon (170:46 - 170:50)
that wasn't relevant and then was (170:49 - 170:52)
there's nothing about omite itself that (170:50 - 170:55)
makes it good but omite is like it was (170:52 - 170:58)
definitely of its at it of its time it (170:55 - 171:01)
was unique in that it was one of very (170:58 - 171:04)
few Pokemon that had fossil evolutions (171:01 - 171:06)
and it was something that you got early (171:04 - 171:09)
on as a as a choice that you had to (171:06 - 171:11)
make and I think a lot of people would (171:09 - 171:13)
agree that it's the lesser of those two (171:11 - 171:16)
choices right that I don't know that I (171:13 - 171:18)
can those three choices rather if you (171:16 - 171:20)
count aerod or not aerod yeah yeah (171:18 - 171:23)
Aerodactyl look what other (171:20 - 171:27)
Pokemon was a loser and just not a good (171:23 - 171:30)
Pokemon then that became something more (171:27 - 171:32)
than that like what other Nuzleaf (171:30 - 171:36)
Nuzleaf because of nuzlock challenge yes (171:32 - 171:39)
um but it's not on the list yeah yeah (171:36 - 171:41)
yeah yeah but but I'm saying that that (171:39 - 171:43)
the the fact that other Pokemon like (171:41 - 171:45)
that exist means that this isn't a (171:43 - 171:48)
unique situation and I don't think (171:45 - 171:51)
you and I don't think that it is the (171:48 - 171:54)
most representational one of of the (171:51 - 171:55)
story you're trying to argue deserves a (171:54 - 171:58)
spot because this is a group of people (171:55 - 172:01)
that that that are not the Pokemon (171:58 - 172:03)
Community as a as a whole I still think (172:01 - 172:05)
that Twitch Plays Pokemon is the Pokemon (172:03 - 172:07)
Community I think that Twitch Plays (172:05 - 172:10)
Pokemon was an important role for poke (172:07 - 172:12)
it was an important thing for Pokemon (172:10 - 172:15)
and I think that I'm of the mind that (172:12 - 172:17)
anything that brings a lot of attention (172:15 - 172:20)
a lot of positive attention to something (172:17 - 172:24)
that I'm a fan of is generally a (172:20 - 172:27)
positive experience as long as it's not (172:24 - 172:30)
brought about in like malicious means (172:27 - 172:34)
it's it's a good thing I think that (172:30 - 172:36)
Twitch Plays Pokemon was a great (172:34 - 172:38)
experience for a lot of people people (172:36 - 172:40)
that weren't necessarily interested in (172:38 - 172:42)
Pokemon people that weren't that were (172:40 - 172:45)
gen oners quote unquote and people that (172:42 - 172:51)
have been fans the entire time and (172:45 - 172:53)
regardless it was something that brought (172:51 - 172:56)
everybody an interest or or a renewed (172:53 - 172:58)
interest in the (172:56 - 173:01)
franchise through very unconventional (172:58 - 173:05)
means and I think that that is an (173:01 - 173:07)
important thing to have for this (173:05 - 173:10)
franchise especially for a franchise (173:07 - 173:13)
that has slowly over time grown a little (173:10 - 173:15)
bit staler for people who were big fans (173:13 - 173:21)
of it early on and I think that a lot of (173:15 - 173:23)
the you know the gimmicks and the jokes (173:21 - 173:26)
and whatever that came out of Pokemon (173:23 - 173:28)
Twitch Plays Pokemon were good (173:26 - 173:31)
experiences for everybody who who were (173:28 - 173:32)
experiencing them they weren't just (173:31 - 173:34)
memes they weren't just gimmicks they (173:32 - 173:37)
were shared experiences that everybody (173:34 - 173:40)
got to celebrate over and omite was the (173:37 - 173:43)
epitome of those shared experiences and (173:40 - 173:46)
celebration that being said I've already (173:43 - 173:48)
said that I feel like farfetched is a (173:46 - 173:51)
better choice of the two I mean I I (173:48 - 173:53)
don't want people to look at the list (173:51 - 173:55)
and go oh farfetched is on there because (173:53 - 173:57)
it's one of Steve's favorite Pokemon I (173:55 - 173:59)
think a ton of people like farfetched I (173:57 - 174:03)
like everyone I know loves farfetch so (173:59 - 174:05)
it's a pretty great Pokemon I I would (174:03 - 174:06)
want I would rather have people look at (174:05 - 174:08)
the list and go amanite is on there (174:06 - 174:10)
because of twitch play Pokemon and that (174:08 - 174:15)
Twitch Plays Pokemon had was so incredi (174:10 - 174:18)
important to just the Pokémon community (174:15 - 174:20)
in a whole like it was one of the most (174:18 - 174:21)
important things that happen to the (174:20 - 174:24)
Pokemon community so I would like to (174:21 - 174:28)
propose it was I would like (174:24 - 174:30)
compromise given that we've been going (174:28 - 174:33)
for like five hours (174:30 - 174:36)
um I feel the amount of discussion that (174:33 - 174:38)
we've had over (174:36 - 174:41)
omite gives it some amount of Merit in (174:38 - 174:42)
that it is a hotly (174:41 - 174:46)
contested concept amongst ourselves um (174:42 - 174:48)
and you know recognizing that Twitch (174:46 - 174:50)
Plays Pokemon was a huge event during (174:48 - 174:55)
its time and omite is emblematic of of (174:50 - 174:58)
that period of time and also in my own (174:55 - 175:00)
personal interest I would really like to (174:58 - 175:03)
see farfetched on the final list I'd be (175:00 - 175:06)
willing to sacrifice my final two and (175:03 - 175:09)
allow those two to be on the list sure (175:06 - 175:12)
Pokemon is is is an important part part (175:09 - 175:14)
of Pokemon is that it's embroiled in (175:12 - 175:16)
cont rsy completely so if we didn't have (175:14 - 175:18)
a controversial pick then what would we (175:16 - 175:20)
be doing sure put it on the list I hate (175:18 - 175:22)
it and I think it's gross and disgusting (175:20 - 175:25)
that that our attempt to show that the (175:22 - 175:27)
the effect the Pokemon Community has on (175:25 - 175:29)
a thing is a small subsection of it but (175:27 - 175:32)
whatever put it on but Will's right the (175:29 - 175:35)
fact that we're so divided on it makes (175:32 - 175:39)
it a pretty important (175:35 - 175:39)
thing Pokemon on this it's not just (175:39 - 175:46)
omite itself either it's the the entire (175:42 - 175:48)
idea of Twitch Plays Pokemon and events (175:46 - 175:50)
like Twitch Plays Pokemon and the effect (175:48 - 175:52)
that they have on the franchise and the (175:50 - 175:55)
community I mean I I could I could have (175:52 - 175:58)
picked Lapras or neok king or zaptos or (175:55 - 176:01)
Pidgeot but those were all pretty well (175:58 - 176:03)
known compared to omite and that was (176:01 - 176:05)
kind of the point I was trying to drive (176:03 - 176:07)
to you've already you've already much (176:05 - 176:10)
like early on divided on your choice (176:07 - 176:12)
between an omite or a (176:10 - 176:16)
Kabuto huh uh I mean I would rather see (176:12 - 176:19)
hydreon on the list than farfetched but (176:16 - 176:21)
I like I said I would rather see (176:19 - 176:24)
farfetched farfetched is cooler Micah (176:21 - 176:26)
and and you were the one that made the (176:24 - 176:29)
original attack on hydrogen so yeah I (176:26 - 176:31)
didn't want to really attack vona (176:29 - 176:32)
because I didn't have a good argument of (176:31 - 176:35)
why but like I would I like hydrogen way (176:32 - 176:37)
more than Volcarona I like hydrogen (176:35 - 176:39)
because of the trading card game I like (176:37 - 176:42)
hydren because it has three heads I like (176:39 - 176:44)
hydren because of its German naming (176:42 - 176:46)
scheme like hydrogen has a lot of things (176:44 - 176:48)
going for it I think hydrogen is a (176:46 - 176:50)
better pseudo legendary than Tyranitar I (176:48 - 176:51)
think it's a better pseudo legendary (176:50 - 176:57)
than um Garchomp I I have a lot of I (176:51 - 176:59)
mean there are things about hydrogen (176:57 - 177:01)
that on the surface I don't really care (176:59 - 177:04)
that much about it one way or another (177:01 - 177:07)
but I do also like a lot of what it's (177:04 - 177:09)
based on and what it's inspired by in (177:07 - 177:11)
the same way that I like what a lot of (177:09 - 177:15)
AIS slash is based on but if it's a (177:11 - 177:16)
debate between either hydrogen or (177:15 - 177:18)
farfetched I feel like far-fetched is (177:16 - 177:21)
more deserving of a top 10 slot not just (177:18 - 177:25)
because it it's something that is your (177:21 - 177:26)
it's not a Pokemon that's your favorite (177:25 - 177:28)
Pokemon or one of your favorite Pokemon (177:26 - 177:31)
but because of the impact that it's had (177:28 - 177:34)
on the podcast the interest that has (177:31 - 177:36)
grown in it from people who are (177:34 - 177:39)
followers of the podcast and because the (177:36 - 177:41)
majority of people who are familiar with (177:39 - 177:43)
farfetch generally like it yeah I think (177:41 - 177:46)
farfetch is a is a Pokemon that tons and (177:43 - 177:48)
tons of people love I think if you would (177:46 - 177:49)
have just stopped and said I think (177:48 - 177:51)
farfetch is a Pokemon that would have (177:49 - 177:54)
been really (177:51 - 177:54)
good yeah farfetch is a Pokemon will (177:54 - 178:00)
your call you want farfetch or do you (177:58 - 178:02)
want one of yours oh I already know I (178:00 - 178:04)
already voted for farfetch all right I (178:02 - 178:07)
sacrific my children to the (178:04 - 178:09)
Flames I want to point out that Will was (178:07 - 178:14)
so adamant about his list yet at this (178:09 - 178:18)
point he only got one on rest in peace (178:14 - 178:21)
fire types is there any one on the list (178:18 - 178:24)
that we want to bring off besides (178:21 - 178:26)
obviously amonite could be debated for (178:24 - 178:29)
hours more or are we satisfied with the (178:26 - 178:32)
10 we have I think that these uh the (178:29 - 178:33)
ones on the list have been through the (178:32 - 178:36)
ringer of debate and discussion and (178:33 - 178:39)
deserve their place I agree all right we (178:36 - 178:42)
have for our listeners I'll just write a (178:39 - 178:45)
long Scalia style dissenting opinion (178:42 - 178:48)
for our listeners in no particular order (178:45 - 178:50)
we have I'll say something about jiggery (178:48 - 178:54)
pokery we have vanilla Golduck (178:50 - 178:59)
chandelier hucha Meowth Gengar Victini (178:54 - 179:02)
AIS slash omite and (178:59 - 179:04)
farfetch the last part of this podcast (179:02 - 179:08)
is arranging them into a top 10 oh no (179:04 - 179:10)
are we aren't we already oh God we've (179:08 - 179:13)
been here so long we can't do this omite (179:10 - 179:15)
must be number one (179:13 - 179:17)
I'm supposed to I honorable mention (179:15 - 179:20)
shinja I just want to shout that out (179:17 - 179:23)
real quick before rest in peace I think (179:20 - 179:26)
I think organizing them will only take (179:23 - 179:28)
10 to 15 minutes I think that's actually (179:26 - 179:31)
pretty easy what is your proposed (179:28 - 179:33)
organization uh what do you guys think (179:31 - 179:35)
is number one I guess and we go from (179:33 - 179:39)
there chandelier I think that the fact (179:35 - 179:41)
that chandeler is on here twice is (179:39 - 179:44)
enough to put it in the in the top slot (179:41 - 179:47)
I would have said Gengar but sure no (179:44 - 179:48)
Gengar is twoo really you would put (179:47 - 179:52)
Gengar that high yes oh yeah what I (179:48 - 179:55)
don't agree to that um well I mean I (179:52 - 179:57)
would obviously want vanilla to be (179:55 - 179:59)
number one but I know that I I would put (179:57 - 180:02)
vanilla way higher than (179:59 - 180:06)
Gengar I would too I I mean I think (180:02 - 180:09)
because chandeler was on the list twice (180:06 - 180:12)
and that will was Will said that he (180:09 - 180:14)
forgot to put on his list I would say (180:12 - 180:18)
that's number one sure yep but I would I (180:14 - 180:22)
don't know I don't I I still am not (180:18 - 180:24)
adamant on Gengar oh I wasn't adamant (180:22 - 180:27)
about it either but I but I thought that (180:24 - 180:29)
that was going to be the softball that (180:27 - 180:31)
we would all agree upon and I turned out (180:29 - 180:33)
to be wrong I would put like I thought (180:31 - 180:34)
it was going to be a safe pick but (180:33 - 180:38)
apparently not I mean I can argue my why (180:34 - 180:40)
it's my favorite Pokemon but I don't (180:38 - 180:41)
think that we I pretty much already did (180:40 - 180:43)
that I I I would I don't think that's (180:41 - 180:45)
going to (180:43 - 180:47)
benefit any of us in any way I would I (180:45 - 180:49)
would put Hawlucha I would put vanilla I (180:47 - 180:54)
would put Victini I would put omite I (180:49 - 180:56)
would put Golduck I will recede Gengar (180:54 - 180:58)
to the third slot if villax makes it to (180:56 - 181:00)
the second spot second slot I would love (180:58 - 181:02)
for vanilla to be number two that would (181:00 - 181:04)
make my a that would that would make (181:02 - 181:07)
stay up until past my bedtime worth it I (181:04 - 181:09)
think I mean vanilla was the first (181:07 - 181:12)
Pokemon we bed deserves right and the (181:09 - 181:14)
reason that it deserves a slot is (181:12 - 181:16)
because of a lot of the arguments that (181:14 - 181:21)
we made in in defense of the it's it's (181:16 - 181:23)
ironic too because a lot of the (181:21 - 181:26)
arguments that we made for vinix vanilla (181:23 - 181:27)
were (181:26 - 181:30)
in uh opposition to the like gen one (181:27 - 181:33)
arguments but we wound up with like half (181:30 - 181:35)
of the list is Gen one (181:33 - 181:37)
Pokemon yep will you go with vanilla (181:35 - 181:40)
being number two yeah that's fine not (181:37 - 181:41)
not like I'm going to be able to win any (181:40 - 181:45)
debates on that one uh I think I don't (181:41 - 181:46)
know I'm just talking out loud here to (181:45 - 181:49)
move this conversation along number I (181:46 - 181:52)
like Victini or no I think Gengar didn't (181:49 - 181:54)
Mah you said you you were gonna do that (181:52 - 181:58)
to to re Gengar number three second slot (181:54 - 182:01)
to give Gengar third slot I guess ah (181:58 - 182:05)
yeah yeah Gengar absolutely Victini (182:01 - 182:08)
number four I think I like Victini at (182:05 - 182:11)
number four was Will's only pick Mike (182:08 - 182:14)
you good with Victini at four yeah I can (182:11 - 182:16)
agree with (182:14 - 182:18)
that ah (182:16 - 182:21)
I I think Golduck was an easy pick for (182:18 - 182:24)
everyone I think yeah golduck's good (182:21 - 182:27)
Hawlucha I think so too Golduck I I (182:24 - 182:32)
would hucha yeah right uh what we have (182:27 - 182:35)
left here we have Meowth we have we have (182:32 - 182:38)
AIS slash we have omite we have farfetch (182:35 - 182:41)
what have farfetch next yeah you guys (182:38 - 182:45)
want farfetch that high I'm going to (182:41 - 182:47)
I'm in Breaking order I'm going to say (182:45 - 182:51)
that we put omite at 10 just because it (182:47 - 182:53)
was such a controversial controversial (182:51 - 182:58)
pick I agree with that yep and farfetch (182:53 - 182:59)
after (182:58 - 183:02)
Hawlucha yeah I think birds in a row I (182:59 - 183:05)
think that AIS slash yeah Meowth and AIS (183:02 - 183:07)
slash because AIS slash barely made the (183:05 - 183:11)
cut I would agree with that all right we (183:07 - 183:13)
have our list so for our listeners (183:11 - 183:14)
follow (183:13 - 183:16)
along who would have guessed this (183:14 - 183:21)
podcast would be almost 4 hours long (183:16 - 183:25)
gosh we have very heated from number 10 (183:21 - 183:27)
up (183:25 - 183:33)
omite AIS slash meow farfetch hucha (183:27 - 183:36)
Golduck you have three birds in a row (183:33 - 183:42)
here Victini Gengar vanilla and (183:36 - 183:47)
Chandelure is its super effective top 10 (183:42 - 183:49)
Pokemon from Generations 1 through (183:47 - 183:52)
Generation 6 and none of this will (183:49 - 183:55)
matter when Generation 7 comes out (183:52 - 183:59)
because all 10 of them will be mimik (183:55 - 183:59)
you what an episode the fact that the (184:00 - 184:04)
fact that I'm happy about seven out of (184:02 - 184:07)
10 of them is a good sign I think yeah I (184:04 - 184:08)
think I'm I'm pretty happy with this (184:07 - 184:10)
list what about you guys I feel good (184:08 - 184:13)
about it I mean I I I there are a couple (184:10 - 184:17)
that I don't really care about that much (184:13 - 184:21)
but on the whole I like what wound up on (184:17 - 184:24)
here I mean really aside from Victini I (184:21 - 184:26)
guess the the everything else I I have (184:24 - 184:29)
an interest in all right well that's (184:26 - 184:32)
that will you feeling good nope all (184:29 - 184:35)
right good completely disagree with (184:32 - 184:38)
everything that's exactly what we exp (184:35 - 184:41)
down you oh perfect this is gone exactly (184:38 - 184:43)
as planned Travis where can our list (184:41 - 184:47)
listeners find you uh twitter.com (184:43 - 184:52)
thraw will uh wash in the sink Micah you (184:47 - 184:53)
can find me on Twitter at Mike of the (184:52 - 184:55)
brave and you can find me on Twitch at (184:53 - 184:58)
twitch.tv the brave which I canceled (184:55 - 185:01)
tonight so that we could do well I told (184:58 - 185:04)
you we'd be done by 8 it is now (185:01 - 185:07)
10:00 I had the foresight to cancel it (185:04 - 185:09)
in advance because I figured it would go (185:07 - 185:11)
a lot longer than 8:00 I really didn't (185:09 - 185:13)
think it'd go this long you can follow (185:11 - 185:16)
me on T at dragging a lake you can also (185:13 - 185:18)
follow the podcast on Twitter at poemon (185:16 - 185:21)
podcast if Kickstarter backers are okay (185:18 - 185:24)
with this going out to more people I (185:21 - 185:26)
will make it happen but technically this (185:24 - 185:28)
is only exclusive for their (185:26 - 185:30)
ears and uh we'll probably do something (185:28 - 185:31)
like this in the future maybe we'll just (185:30 - 185:33)
stick to one generation or something I (185:31 - 185:35)
don't know we'll find out I had a lot of (185:33 - 185:38)
fun doing this though same a good time (185:35 - 185:41)
it was really cool to actually be angry (185:38 - 185:43)
over the omite thing for a very long (185:41 - 185:45)
time learned a lot about each other and (185:43 - 185:48)
I I think it's I think it was cool that (185:45 - 185:53)
we could properly defend Pokemon in a (185:48 - 185:55)
great conversation like it wasn't just (185:53 - 185:58)
because oh golduck's cool cuz he's blue (185:55 - 186:01)
it was because of this which I think is (185:58 - 186:02)
really cool I would just like to point (186:01 - 186:05)
out on a closing note that everybody (186:02 - 186:07)
doubted my picks immediately going in (186:05 - 186:10)
