much thanks what's up everyone welcome to a special episode of the Pokemon podcast it is super effective it's super effective stuff like that I'm your host SBJ and i am here solo like i said it is a special episode i will consider this episode 208 since it is pokemon relevant very pokemon relevant in fact that i will be reviewing pokin tournament now I say that with a question mark in my voice because I don't review stuff ever an oar has pokemon podcast calm or it's super effective the podcasts ever been focused or geared around reviews that's just not what we do we're just a bunch of guys that have been talking about what we like and don't like about pokemon for several years but I did get a review copy of poking tournament from Nintendo I got it almost a little over a week ago about 10 days ago here pretty much two weeks from the release date of poking tournament which is March 18th if I'm not mistaken the non-disclosure form dates I cannot post anything until nine a-m on March fifteenth which I'm recording this March 14th so by the time you're listening to this it's all good so I'm going to share my thoughts and give you my opinion about poking tournament that's pretty much the gist of this episode I have some notes I have some questions from Twitter I have the roster up I will probably forget some stuff now before I begin assessing my thoughts on poking tournament if you are a hardcore fighting game fan if you go to evo if you're super high amazing rank in street fighter 4 and or five if you play Mortal Kombat ten four hours you're probably not going to like what I have to say cus I'm not good at fighting games never have been probably never will I'm getting too old to be quick enough for anything in life just keep that in mind if you're super hardcore in the fighting games you're gonna have to get somebody else's opinion who is very good at fighting games because i don't think i could speak to that caliber second statement / bullet points i note asterisk thing a little like gift aight is it that no matter if i get something wrong I apologize I again I'm not an expert at fighting games I'm not somebody who reviews things so this is really my opinion and a lot of people want to know if they should buy it especially people who don't like fighting games so let us begin with my thoughts on poking tournament and my art he'll review of poking tournament alright we will start with the initial impressions the game itself is gorgeous it runs on wii u if you haven't figured it out it is a one to two player fighting game there is no minigames there is no 4 player mode it is 122 multiplet 122 player multiplayer fighting game you're single player you converse computers in a story mode or in just single battles which doesn't really do anything mate I mean it could be for practice but there is also a practice mode there is local so you can play with a fright on the couch and I will get to that in a second and then of course there is online play where there is three different types of ranked although I think they're similar in some aspect and i'll get to that too and then there is friendly online play now not knowing anyone personally that has the game i could not test friendly but before i even dive into that i know i'm just like i keep backing up on myself backing up on myself let's talk about the whole menu real quick so we have the fairest league i believe thats there fareham lee sorry my autocorrect corrected it to Ferris fareham league which is your story mode and you have a an assistant or like a coach or what like a friend who is encouraging you to go through this league she has a camera modern dance like Nicole or near something with a net but she has a weavile so she's always like my weave Isles cheering for you Bob so there is that and I only did a bit of the story mode we'd be honest sitting on the couch playing and fighting him by herself against computers gets real old real fast and it was very hard to hold my attention but I went through some of the story you want you unlock through the story mode you probably will eventually unlock mu 2 and shadow Mewtwo those are the only two characters I did not play and I'm assuming one if not both of them are the bosses at the end of the story mode but when you go through story mode you'll be able to unlock new hats or hairstyles or shirts or little title badges I mean it is there's no story to it you're just kind of going through the ranks getting harder and harder opponents I mentioned there a single battle I mentioned there's practice there is also the local battle which is another option and online battle the main thing is called my town which is in the center of this map and that will let you adjust your trainer there's something called titles so a title is something you put under your name so I believe when you start you start with something called newbie trainer and if you win five it matches in a row whether it's computers or real people you unlock a title that says unbeatable trainer you spend a lot of money you or you earn a lot of money I think you get a title of like millionaire there's a ton of titles i want to say there's over 100 there's a there's just a bunch and then you also get a comment setting so that is like a little catchphrase your character says so that could be like good luck or pleased to meet you just something generic and there's a bunch of those two probably about a hundred of those to mine my comment says I'm freezing here because I'm always cold so I thought that was funny oh it was funny to me insert maybe a laugh track or something and then there's your trainer customization so there are you when you set up your trainer you can give him a name him or her name and you can assign skin color and that's about it I think you can assign one other thing but I was at first I was like what I can't adjust my hair or my hair color that's all unlocked so if you want a like black hair in shaggy you have done like that if you want blonde long hair you have done like that if you unlocked black hair shaggy you still have to unlock blonde hair shaggy so there is a lot of unlocks now you can use the money you earn you earn pokey coins or whatever when you complete a battle and story ode you don't earn any in practice or single you do earn an online you don't earn in locals a lot of ways you can earn and a lot of playing where you don't earn anything which okay maybe you come if you want to save up and buy a shirt I mean it only took me like four or five matches to make enough money to buy a shirt and I would say the shirts are a little more expensive than everything else there so trainer customization almost everything there needs to be unlocked whether that's just randomly you will get random unlocks after so you will get random unlocks sometimes when you complete a battle whether you win or lose it says like lucky bonus and then you get the unlock or you can just spend the money for it from what I've noticed in trainer because customization just to run off everything most are unlocks they seem to have 12 different hats they're all just different color hats and that hat seems to be a fedora or furry fedora like there are no beards or moustaches like I said about hair if you want a certain hairstyle there's like eight different colors of a hairstyle that you need to unlock there's like little headsets you can lock there is glasses there's little band-aids that go under your eyes or maybe it's over your nose but those are like the only facial features there's only one feature for freckles there is a couple shirts probably i would say about 20 shirts there are three different backgrounds like you could have flames behind your trainer or hearts behind your trainer and I think electricity behind your trainer there's only three of those but you're going to get there that the customization there i don't know about females i didn't try to make a girl at all there's enough customers customization in your character and your title and your comment to definitely stand out i don't know how much again because i'll get to what i've done online let's talk about pokemon there are every pokemon is unlocked except for Mewtwo and shadow Mewtwo of for my understanding you need the card to unlock shadow Mewtwo or they did say if I read correctly you who can unlock him if you go through the whole game that's why I'm assuming he is one of the end bosses oh I played all the characters except those two so let me run down what I've played I'll just run down the characters first Blaziken Brax Ian chandelure Charizard Garchomp guard of war Gengar Lucario Machamp mu tou Pikachu Pikachu Libre which is a girl Pikachu Libre by the way little heart on the tail Sceptile shadow Mewtwo suicune and we've I'll obviously being a big chandelure fan I went with my boyish and allure and Chandler is considered a heavy other heavies would be Garchomp Machamp Charizard and I think that's it Machamp Charizard Garchomp chandelier believe those are all the heavies I would i would say that chandelure and Garchomp are by far some of the slowest Garchomp has a lot of moves that can propel him forward and machamp is also pretty slow he's a little quicker on his feet and movement and he does have a couple moves that propel him forward but Garchomp has just just walking speed i would say that Garchomp and Chandler are the slowest mu2 and charizard seem a little faster just walking that's not like jumping forward or anything now again I want to preference that I could be mistaken I did play all of them i didn't i didn't set up a timer at in time and i'm just going off of i played almost every character three to four matches in computers and local and some online so i was really trying to get a feel of everything with that being said I do like Chandelure the chandeleur while being slow has a lot of ranged attacks I feel like Chandler has not good HP compared to others and now that's a big thing that I want to touch on all Pokemon have different HP levels something like a Pikachu or a Pikachu Libre or a weavile will not have as much HP as a machamp or a Charizard with that being said everyone's burst attack which is like they're super all the births attacks do different damage and from from what I was playing because I I did play with everyone I did try to land everyone I did successful and everyone's burst I did try to calculate numbers gangers seems to have the most powerful burst at doing almost fifty percent damage on hit with that being said Pokemon earn their burst at different times so Pikachu Libre will earn its burst a lot faster than like a pokemon like Chandelure and that again has to do on how well you're doing the match if you're picking up the burst things on the field okay so let me just run down the line Blaziken Blaziken is a real weird Pokemon he's like a giant chicken I think we all know that I actually like playing as Blaziken he's pretty quick he's I believe he's a normal normal so you have normal technical power and speed those are how your Pokemon break down before you pick them Blaziken very good average very good starting place does a lot of kicks that's pretty much the the primary thing that blazing and does pretty quick a couple moves that propel him forward all around you know not not low HP not high HP hits pretty decently blaziken's a good choice moving on to brac seein break braixen braixen didn't like I thought I was going to like so this is actually a female Pokemon there's just it's just noticeable and I like that Pokemon company did go I Pikachu Libre and breaks in our female Chandler might be female 2 it's just hard to tell the gender preference of a ghost bandolier um I didn't like breaks in I did battle breaks in it online and it has a lot of ranged attacks a lot of fireballs a lot of fire bursts and it was good it also rides on his broomstick but I just wasn't a fan I felt like he didn't hit hard enough I felt like it was it is considered believe an average Pokemon just didn't feel good to me and I played it a couple times and I just didn't enjoy it going on the Chandeleur shamblers probably when I played the most but not the one I like the most I really tried to get down its moves and it has a giant I don't I should have the move list actually tells you which Pokemon moves there are like night / or sucker punch or low kick your Thunderbolt or you get it Chandler shoots out a giant beam and it's it's very similar to suicune has a giant beam and Mewtwo has a giant beam they'll send out and if you time it right you can kind of spam it over and over so like if you time it right when they get up you can beam them again if they're not quick enough to block which is a little again I'm not good at the game so maybe I'm just bad and I get hit by it every time but it is like then like in all fighting games I feel like you're like in Street Fighter you can spam a fireball over and over and and whatnot Charizard I feel secretly feel like Charizard on balance I feel like Charizard now charizard is a power Pokemon I feel like it has a lot of health and it hits really hard and it has really I I just feel like it's is unbalanced just because it's Charizard but with that being said Charizard has a lot of cool moves its burst turns it into mega Charizard and it's a giant Fire Blast I was indifferent if I was to pick up our pokemon I'll get to the one I like the most Garchomp I'm not a big Garchomp fan I know a lot of people like Garchomp Garchomp has a lot of like i said earlier allah moves that propel Garchomp forward which makes up for how slow it is on its feet Garchomp can also dig and i also like no sand attack which is ironically super funny because i was a very old it's super effective joke but it's the Garchomp it is what you expect Garchomp to be but Gardevoir was probably one the one I played the least I had the same feel of Gardevoir like i did with brac braixen braixen I just didn't like it girl it felt very floaty a lot of the moves seemed not close up but not far away it's almost like you had to be in a sweet spot of which kind of makes sense for how it played but yeah very floating to me kind of slow for being at the leave Gardevoir was is a technical fighter so yeah I wasn't I just wasn't a fan moving on to gengar I think gengar probably one of the Pokemon you've seen the most online of people using gengar is considered a technical fighter it does have a lot of teleportation so ganger can teleport quickly find you a lot of its moves like teleport like there's like shadow sneak or sucker punch that just kind of show up behind you and punch in the back of the head gang guard for my from my playing has the best burst of sucking you into a giant gengar mouth and it looks awesome and terrifying at the same time that being said I thought I'd like anger a lot and I just didn't really get into a gengar was for being a technical fighter I felt like he was kind of sluggish now moving around the arena felt fine felt normal but it almost felt like Halen when I say it felt fine felt normal felt faster than most power characters but also still had a little sluggishness to him like obviously gang are could teleport really quickly to move him around the arena quicker than anyone but when you're not doing that it's almost like you feel like a slug Lucario you guys all know I don't like Lucario he panders to a certain audience which is if you like Lucario fine he has a nice blue fur I'll give you that in poking tournament he to me feels the same void as Blaziken in similarity is very good for a starting player not not too slow not too fast not too weak not too strong very average if I was to pick one of those two I just like blaziken's moveset a lot better I just like how the combos flow and I'll get to how combos flow surprise hit to me and my actual favorite was Machamp for the actually the first four to five hours Machamp was the only pokemon I didn't play and when I finally played it I like Machamp a lot a lot a lot a lot now I'm a champ is a power character and he every Pokemon has the same grab tight move now how it gets executors of course up to that poke button and how much damage it does depends on the pokemon but I believe I'm trying to think of the controller it's B and X so if you press B and X at the same time you grab your opponent and that is the most successful when your opponent is blocking with the shield if your opponent has a shield up and you do a grab you will automatically successfully land that grab all those pokemon have that Machamp though has another grab i believe it's double-a and machamp will do a sprint I say spurn it's not that fast but he will sprint towards the Pokemon and grab it and do a different grab from my playing through all these Pokemon without Mewtwo and shadow Mewtwo Machamp is the only pokemon with multiple grabs besides the standard xB grab like I said double tapping a in the direction of your opponent will force my champ to do a run and a different type of graph which does a lot of damage if you can land it I like my champ a lot I think his moves that's really cool again a lot of grabs he also to me feels like one of the quicker heavies on top of that he does a lot of damage and he has a lot of health the biggest disadvantage though and I ran and ran into this online against sceptile and breaks ian is Machamp almost gets destroyed by anything with good range if you can keep Machamp away it's very hard for Machamp that closed that distance because of his speed and because of his moveset now he does have a couple moves that propel forward but not enough to avoid constant fireballs I'm and I've said this before probably not the best player so I don't know how to counter it but it was frustrating if you are playing against somebody who is aggressive somebody who just jumps in somebody who doesn't really black Oh machamp is killer so killer in his moveset in his counters in his grabs um I like him a lot but against somebody with a range attack I feel like that's where Machamp falls apart and that makes sense also Machamp having multiple throws makes sense he has forearms he also does a sweet dropkick if if you pull off a combo right mewtwo I didn't play I played against somebody with him you too and like i said earlier has a very long range beam attack um and i got destroyed by me too I feel like maybe me too has the charger treatment now this is could all be my head but Mewtwo maybe has a little too strong a little too much health little too quick I haven't played me too though so i can't speak on that Pikachu and Pikachu Libre I'll throw them both together they are considered speed Pokemon they do have different moves and different burst but some other moves are slightly similar it's Pikachu he can do with Thunderbolts he can do a quick attack he can do a double team I can't remember Pikachu's burst I think he just turns into a giant Thunderball no he does this weird like uppercut punch to you he punches you with his electric fist which is really weird Pikachu Libre has a really cool burst he throws you into a wrestling ring and stands on the corner and like does a body slam off it's real cool I didn't like Pikachu a war Pikachu Libre they don't have as much health as the other Pokemon they are extremely fast but they don't hit very hard which probably why they fall under the speed character Sceptile i can't i'm pretty sure subtitles a technical fighter has a lot of range attacks Sceptile from my playthrough is the only pokemon that can get health back with a Giga Drain and leech seed I think the two moves are so to touch on playing online I played five matches before I recorded this online because when i try to do online the other night I didn't get matched with anyone I got matched up with shady penguin twice both using sceptile and i was using Machamp and because of sept-iles ranged attacks i couldn't really get close enough now I did win one round um because once you kind of breakthrough and you get up there close to the champ you can do some damage as long as you keep that distance a minimum but it's very hard to at least I had a problem trying to close that distance initially and like I said sceptile does get health back depending on certain moves it does that being said when i played sceptile i just wasn't very good at it and I yeah I date sept-iles like a crit he's a lame Christmas tree Allen I don't know like them shadow me too i didn't plays sweet kun feels awkward maybe cuz it's one of the few pokemon and like four legs it's fine i feel like a lot of his moves are very similar to Schindler it has a lot of it has that giant ice beam which is very similar to channelers beam it has a an aurora beam which is similar to a different move that Chandler does it shoots out like ice like icy wind which is similar to Chandlers little flayers that it sends out it has a lot of similar like they are different but they are very similar suicune a bit faster i think suicune is also a technical fighter I didn't play suicune a lot compared to the other ones it was it was fine I heard that suicune is the broken Pokemon in the game and what I mean by that is that it is for people who are serious or competitive they are focusing on suicune I didn't see why I've never watched good people use suicune but when I was playing against it it just it has a lot of beams and it has a lot of distance move so maybe that's why and the last pokemon which was my favorite until machamp is weavile weavile has one of the best moves in the game I'm not joking the combo is mash why repeatedly actually about five times it does just a / / / a different / a different / and then a big / and you can do that pretty easily by mashing lie and I'll get to the move sent in a different we vials considered speed poke money's very fast he doesn't do a lot of damage his burst attack does about twenty-five percent of your opponent's health and in retrospect gang gars does about 50 other Pokemon range between 30 and 40 so I would say that we vials is on the lower end I'm sure there's gonna be like a YouTube video like next week of exactly how much damage everything does and you guys can tell me I'm wrong but whatever I like we buy a lot he's very fast if I was to pick any speed Pokemon it'd be weavile I just like its moves better than Pikachu's I he can close the distance really fast he has like night / and like a quick attack and he's a cool pokemon very cool one of my favorites it would be a toss-up between Machamp and weavile and then I would probably just do Chandler just because I like shandler so much but like i said i really like Blaziken a lot too I would love to spend more time with other Pokemon I just haven't I haven't had enough time to spend with everything I was trying to get everything for you guys alright so movesets how does the game play you ask it plays so if i do the spectrum of Fighters let's just say the most hardcore fighter i could say right now would be street fighter four or five just pick one street fighter and i would say one of the most i'm gonna get a lot heat for this a lot of hate one of the moat on the other end of the spectrum i would say super smash brothers is at the bottom end and why i say that is because smash brothers moveset is very simple a whole day four day down a up a repeat that with be down be up be hold B whereas street fighter is a lot of memorization of combos quarter circle a quarter circle back be i'm not i'm not trying to do a disservice to smash brothers although i don't consider smash brothers are real fighting game but i would just say that memorizing its moves are very simple street fighter you have to put a lot of time'n i would say pokin is way closer to smash brothers and moves when i said earlier that one of we vials moves in the move list says repeatedly tap why I was not joking that is what it says I think the most complicated move i saw was bored B comma B its moves are very simple when you're in the modes now there's two foot there's two I can't remember what they're called there is the when you're fighting and poking you are started in a 3d environment and your moves are slightly different compared to a 2d environment and the way it's which is just how you hit and interact with the other pokemon I'm sure there is a more exact science to that but the moves you do in 3d are different than the ones you do in 2d so there is memorization of okay I can do this move but now if I'm in 2d I can't but with that being said when most of the moves are Ford a mash why repeatedly hold x and y at the same time hold X and be at the same time like that is the extent of your moves getting more into the burst moves where you do your finisher or your super or whatever you want to call it you're going to press l r2 activate that and then you're on a time limit and your moves are you move faster your moves are more powerful but to actually activate your super again because you go into burst mode and then to actually activate your burst you all you do is head L&R again and you hopefully connect if they're blocking they block it but that's that's the extent i know in mortal combat it's a little more difficult to pull off your finisher you have to memorize a couple more buttons than just ellen are at the same time so i could probably go on but right now this is what i will say if I'm gonna get this out the way you're listening to this podcast because you like Pokemon clearly we are Pokemon base podcast so if you're listening we already have that other way I already know you like Pokemon you've made it 30 minutes in so because you like Pokemon the question is should you buy poke in this Friday March 18th when it comes out if you like smash brothers heck if you if you love smash brothers but if he even if you like smash brothers and you're listening to this podcast which tells me you like pokemon then yes you should absolutely a poke in even if you're a casual smash brothers fan that would be my answer if you do not like smash brothers that tells me that you probably don't really like fighting games then my answer is no don't get pokin it's not going to convince you to like a fighting game at the end of the day it is a two-player fighting game whether you're going to play online or you're going to play against a computer or you're going to play with somebody on your couch and there is dis advantages to playing with somebody on your couch and I will get to that but that that that is the best review I could possibly give do you like smash brothers yes or no do you like Pokemon obviously you're listening to the show if you like smash brothers you should go out and buy pokin no matter what it will be to your standards I believe it is a more of a fighting game than puck and smash brothers is gets made from that but that would be my that would be my review so take that make your decisions now but I have about eight Twitter questions to get to let me talk about online real quick I played five matches tonight before I got on line the other night I tried to connect I waited I don't know four or five minutes and it couldn't find me a single match so what happens when you connect on line is you get a 10 second timer and if the game cannot find an opponent within 10 seconds it will match you against a computer and what kind of sucks is you can beat that computer or not get any fight money your rewards for doing so but once the game finds an opponent it will interrupt you and pull you out of your computer match to match with that opponent so I played five matches online i won one of them I lost for two were against shady penguin the longest I went was to full CPU matches before I was partnered with somebody again I did play another guy back to back twice he actually had a bracket and lost him the first time and beat him the second time um very tough with machan Braxton has a lot of distance keeping me away fire moves so yeah it was this is where I get critical the online play was atrocious it was so bad leg wise and I didn't mean I don't mean like leggy as in skipping frames the game would just stop completely and like a full second would go through and then it would pick up where it left off it was frustrating and I mean I can I can't blame it on the servers being slammed because there aren't that many people playing that's why i keep getting matched with the same people which is also frustrating when you go in in your record is 00 and you get matched with somebody with eighty six matches 60 of them being wins you're just kind of like well i'm probably gonna lose which happened to me four times actually ah but yeah all games were extremely laggy except for one and even in that one there was still legs so I don't know if they're gonna fix that but um not fun in a fighting game with leg otherwise what else do I have here so oh yeah online battle there are four different modes that are ranked match there's friendly match theirs point ranking and there is win ranking so for my understanding I didn't go into all of these i did a ranked match and I believe ranked match is supposed to pair you with somebody against a ranked of course me being 00 right away they paired me with somebody who was 5630 friendly match it does keep records of that but I don't know if it shows that ahead of time point ranking is when you win a match only 11 you get a certain amount of points I'm assuming when you lose you also lose those points so I would my guess would be that it would rent it would match you with opponents based on the point and then win ranking I'm assuming it matches based on wins because points your viewpoints in your your winds could be a different number and rank i would assume would be all of that combined the other things just to touch on real quick before we can't imagine i've been talking this long hopefully you guys like it is when you're going through story mode and when you're going through just online battles you level up your pokemon i don't know what the max level is I got Chandler up to eight and we'll ask you to assign points into power defense your assists and then your burst and you can reassign those at any time if you go back to my town and then you go into your character you can you know you can put everything in the power you can put everything into defense mix and match I don't know how that actually translates into online or local over that store I don't know how that works I don't know if a chandelier with no base stats would be easily outmatched by Chandelure with a bunch of points into like power defense I don't know I haven't played the game long enough I haven't seen I not sitting there with a notepad writing down numbers I just don't know as four assists characters you start with three sets you start with sniping mattress a Mogan fennigan and frogadier and EV as you play through the match your assist fills up you can hit l1 to bring it bring it out and then it does something for example snivy chases after them and does a leaf storm Lapras does a surf over them a moga will reduce their speed and their defense I believe fennekin is more of like a defensive attack so if you need to get somebody away from you that's where fennekin would be better than like a sniper a Lapras what Lapras pushes away too frogadier has like a ranged attack and Evie restores your health I haven't unlocked the other ones I saw other people did like I saw somebody use a cube own against me and they used it twice in the same round that match round and so obviously I would assume cubone regens its assist a lot faster because it was crazy fast and I'm assuming you unlock those through story because I played a lot of stuff that wasn't story and I didn't unlock any so I was disappointed that I did not unlock farfetch and electrode yet I feel like that would might be my dream combo all right let's get to some Twitter questions real quick see what we got here so wrong song hugs on Twitter impressions of online as well as other fighters is offensive focused or is it blocking / countering better so there is a rock-paper-scissors mechanic to the game if somebody is blocking a grab will break that if somebody is grabbing a counter will break that and if somebody is just attacking that will break a counter i sorry i don't have the triangle in front of me but pretty much if somebody puts up a shield and they're not letting down you grab them you're instantly going to break that shield and you're going to go through somebody puts up a shield and you counter it's not going to do anything because their shields up if somebody counters and the new counter second their counter is going to get absorbed into yours and you're going to counter back and all pokemon have same counter buttons I think it's XNA and all poke might have the same grab buttons which is B and why I'm trying to think of the controller they're all the same for all the pokemon so that's nice but you have so if somebody's non stop attacking you you would want to break it with a counter and if somebody's trying to counter your counter kind of counter you you counted them there's a hierarchy there but it all makes sense it's very if somebody is not defensive you want to stay if somebody's not using their she a lot if they're not defense if you want to stay away from grabs because they're going to break through your grab pretty much every time if somebody is very defensive you want to use more grabs because you're just going to have the advantage of breaking that defense the shield the protect is kind of similar to how it works in Smash Brothers where it can eventually be broken the differences in Smash Brothers it kind of dwindles now and it gets like that bubble gets smaller in pokin it you can keep it up as long as you want but it will eventually break if you attack it enough and you do have to attack it a lot to break it in all the games I played somebody only broke my shield my protect probably twice and that was just because I was over protecting because I didn't know how to close the distance so yeah great question Logan rights tweets in tweets in you've mentioned all the pokes seem different with fighting style can you go into some difference more I think I did that earlier but yeah the unique ones that kind of stand out i think char's arts pretty unique Garchomp Gardevoir is unique Pikachu and Pikachu Libre pretty similar sept-iles definitely unique suicune and chandelier seem very similar to me Lucario Blaziken seemed very similar to me Gengar is pretty unique they all are pretty different except how to like execute their moves are all pretty much the same it's probably going to be some combination of forward a or 4b is actually the jump ford why back why ducking why the weave out combo of Smashing why I didn't see that translate to other pokemon but most Pokemon have at least a three-set punch based off why so why why why I will so do something it just seems like we've Isles is five of them instead of three logan also says also will you play with me a hundred for a hundred consecutive hours when it comes out i will definitely be playing with fans I'm bad I don't know how how much I can tolerate losing in a row losing is that fun I mean unless I'm getting better I was playing with Micah earlier and just trying out local play so the game runs at 60 frames a second and playing locally I didn't actually talk about this I'm surprised I made this so far playing locally it brings the number 30 I'm honestly surprised how it doesn't feel different what I mean by that is in mario cart when you're playing two people on the same screen it's running at 60 even online and it feels great you know if you're playing that a lot and you add two more if you had one or two more people in which brings it to the four player local you can tell you can tell instantly the difference between the 60 it was running out to the 30 it goes to so I played a lot of poking and then I had my could play with me and I couldn't tell a difference I'm sure there is a difference I'm my skills as a player just it didn't affect me like I didn't feel like I was it I didn't feel like it was less fun I didn't feel like it was like slower I felt like everything I was doing earlier by myself translated a hundred percent over and like I said I'm sure there's a difference but as a casual player it felt just as smooth as 60 with that being said and that goes tough bunny 13 rights in it goes is is the player one the person that has to use the gamepad and player 2 can use the hoary rumor true what's your favorite fighter so if you are playing locally player 1 has to use the Wii U gamepad player 2 can use whatever they want they can use the Wii U pro controller they can use the hoary fighting controller they can use a wii remote with a nunchuck they can use the Wii the Wii classic controller plugged into a Wii Remote player 1 has to use the gamepad there's no way around that so that's why i said earlier local play could not be as fun as other fighters if one person is stuck to the gamepad one they're not looking at that big screen they're looking at a 7-inch Wii U game screen and to the deeper l and r i don't know if they're l2 and r2 they don't do anything you have to use the upper the the basic l1 and r1 to do the block to do the assistant to do the burst which to me i have small hands so doing the wii u gamepad for our long local play sections is uncomfortable to me that's just a personal preference if you like playing on the wii u gamepad awesome but you will not be able to do to people with the Horry special edition controllers from my from my understanding that i don't have them but I couldn't set up to Wii U pro controller 'he's i had to be forced as player 1 on the gamepad now my favorite fighter at this moment it has been champ except i just lost 100 times with Machamp online cuz i'm not good but i do like we've I'll a lot to do Megaman champion tweets in similar with other fighting games are there alternative costume skin cones skin tones for duplicate oakmont in place mu mu taneously there are no unlocks for the Pokemon you cannot put a birthday hat on Pikachu you cannot give Charizard a bib you cannot put a you cannot put cowboy boots on we've I'll there's none of that and I didn't see any locks for it there was no custom options there's no way to change your pokemons color now if it is Lucario verse Lucario one will be a different tone but you don't get to pick that that is decided by the game when you go in and if if it does exist I have not seen it and I've put 10 to 15 hours in I just it doesn't exist from what I've investigated there are alternative skin tones for your trainer that you only see at the beginning of the battle Jeff jje two tweets in have you had the opportunity do you play with a special controller which is the Horry I have not I do not have that yet Nintendo sent me a digital copy of the game which means i also don't have the shadow Mewtwo card I do have two horizon-- which I don't know what I'm gonna do with the second one because I can't use two on the same we use so i might return it or might do a giveaway for it i'm not sure yeah i would a the hoary controller seems like one of the best ways to play I've been mostly playing on the wii u gamepad because I because you can play the game without needing the TV it's one of those games where the Wii U gamepad pretty much recreates everything unless you're playing local my one complaint local is so when I was playing with Micah he was like oh let me pull up my move list because he was playing his gang gar and so it pulls it up on the TV and on my screen and if just kind of sucks that like I can't look at my move list when he's looking at his because it mimics both screens which is weird because obviously when you're fighting it doesn't mimic it's just a minor complaint it's not the end of the world bronzong hugs rights in how big are the burger king grilled dogs they only seem as big as a couple bites now Burger King started selling hot dogs they are a dollar ninety-nine for a normal hot dog with relish and a hot dog a chili dog I don't do I don't want extra meat I'm a hot dog on that harm % beef a dollar ninety-nine hot dog you are right does not fill you up you need to so expect to spend four dollars on hot dogs they are good they are they are probably the best hot dog I've ever had at a fast food place besides / tillis portillos has some real good hot dogs but Burger King has a good bun and they got a good dog and I like a good dog it's simple the dollar ninety-nine it's really good that was a great question up no that's all of them last thing i want to touch on is there is a meebo a sport it support it does not matter which amoebas you use you can touch anomie bow to the gamepad a different to me about five different amoebas a day and it unlocks title set let titles and character stuff I didn't I haven't seen a meebo unlike anything else but if you have five different of evos you can touch those to the gamepad every day and unlock stuff and that's the extent of the meebo sport I've used a pikachu i used a luigi i use animal crossing villager it didn't care if it was pokemon or not i think that's it i think that is the review i can't believe i talked for almost an hour about this I honestly thought this was going to be 10 minutes hopefully you guys enjoyed it to reiterate it's good pokin is good it has scratched the itch I had for fighting games i'm glad i waited for this and not and didn't buy Street Fighter 5 because I know that I would be even worse than street fighter than I am at pokin it's really fun it's really easy to get into as a fighting game if you do not like fighting games poking is not going to be the one that could is you unless you honestly love pokemon that much that you want to give it a shot I will go back to my my smash brothers check do you like super smash brothers if that answer is a yes that answer is yeah I would play it then you would probably enjoy poking if you don't like smash brothers don't like anything about smash brothers you're not gonna like poking I think that's that I think that's as fair as I can be I'm having a great time with pokin I am not having a great time losing I don't have a great time playing against computers so it's kind of a slug to go through the story but I had a heck of a time playing on the couch with two of my friends I don't know how well that will translate we're playing with people online like people I know online I just don't know this has been the podcast this has been the episode hopefully you enjoyed
