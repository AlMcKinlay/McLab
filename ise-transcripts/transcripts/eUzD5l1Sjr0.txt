Oh what's up everyone welcome to the 220 a--the episode of the Pokemon podcast I'm your hostess bj and with me is you know this whole mix lair thing is is really ruining my normal rhythm normally I make some joke that normally we all make a lot of jokes that we would never make in front of other people and even though you told me hey we're going on mix alert now I forgot about that no I'm still a little shaken by the by the middle school joke I made about two minutes ago I always like to imagine that you know travis has been on since like 31 so we're 220 now minus 30 episodes you've been on for about give or take a hundred ninety episode and that was like waiting for the one where I were i crack what I break I'm tired I think you just cracked and broke oh you certainly destroyed that church boy image will anderson also here who is bad well when did you start like episode 80 80 yeah right around there okay no here we all are wherever this is like the third week we've done live on McLaren Sunday um for some reason I feel like the last couple episodes have been strong that probably has to be in part that we we did like a three week stint of being live on twitch and I don't know I feel like that just kind of threw off our rhythm or something but i like i like just the recording and not seeing your guys's faces i agree if there's so anything I don't want to see it's stephen Travis yeah yeah you know we're mixing it up and we're doing we're only dude that makes their thing I mean you could say that the mix leurs thing could be as distracting as the twitch thing but not nearly as much because I don't have to worry about how my hair looks when we're doing it on Mike slur that's true also like mixer costs money and twitch doesnt so I want to make sure we're at least getting something out of mix l'heure speaking of a mix ler I've been listening to a lot of old it's super effective because that's the primary use if if you if you don't know what to listen to if you're just bored if you're maybe new or do it's super effective and you're like I don't know what to I don't know where to start with the older stuff you just turn on the mixer and something's going to be playing and I have to say after listening to some mixer stuff I it was like the 160 to 180 episode range I always sound like I'm tired like there's no oomph behind my voice and like oh that that doesn't sound like good kuka was an observation I observe what era of episodes was there what was six sixty to eighty that was that was after our hiatus that was what we came back from our Kickstarter we had a hiatus yeah he had a hiatus no yeah we did it was a hundred and fifty is when we had Joe from Sarah beyond yeah and then wasn't there for that one by remember that you know you know you sometimes you have to cut the fat when you're well given that terrible thing I said just like 10 minutes ago I would probably end up saying that to the webmaster of therapy and then we took was that I was probably in like august or something and then we the Kickstarter went live i think in September and then we didn't come back until like novemberish I want to say hmm i don't think it was that long i thought i was just like a month i think it was two months I just remember I could take like those really nice Sunday afternoon naps and not have to set an alarm to wake up in time to court I could just sleep and sleep and recover from my adorable so hard to be up at one p.m. on a sunday dude you don't even know I you know I ran over seven miles today in 90-degree heat so I need a little bit of slack better than I did which was nothing yeah but you it's not like anyone's forcing you to run you're doing that of your free will the Marines are forcing me to because all our tober 30th these are going to hold me to task what on earth could you possibly be talking about the marine corps marathon right yeah but you don't like have to do that oh dude i paid like a hundred and forty dollars to be in that race that's no refunds that's the bribe you must do it this is the problem with races is you have to pay to do them so like once you pay you don't get that money back and it's either I run and make get my money money's worth or I don't run and that money is now down the drain but you know what those medals that they give out for the marine corps marathon are sweet oh there's some of the nicest metals you can get do you have to come in like top 100 to get a medal or Oh everybody gets a medal okay cuz I did the color run and the only thing i got was like blue hair dye in my hair yeah but that's only like three miles right yes it was yeah okay I think yeah that's 3.1 or something I've never done a 5k well I think you'd be able to do a 5k pretty easily I mean I'm imagine since i did over two of them this dress is important yeah um i don't i don't i'm not a fast runner i'm more of a tank than a dps when it comes to running okay I understand so I'm slow and continuous and I like just hold out to the end as opposed to somebody who does a lot of damage right up front but you know if it you're in for the long haul they don't they don't last so more of a road hog and then a tracer now a tank I'm more of a more of a healer when I run I like to stay in the back and drink as much water as possible you you're the dude at the at the refreshment stand handing out the glasses of gatorade right right when i did the Color Run which was several years ago there was only two water stands and I was this Owen wonderful place support it happens every game why would why would you have a water stand at all and I use when you're runnin drinking I didn't drink any water at all this morning did not take any water with me is that isn't that that sounds bad yeah like the opposite of what you should do you have to weigh the balance so for me if it's under 10 miles I don't want to have to carry the weight of water because you have to carry that with you the entire time once I hit over 10 miles then I will take water with me but under 10 miles I don't want to have to have that extra weight that's why you need to have like the kiosk set up so you can stop grab the cup of water drink and keep going well unfortunately there's no charitable kiosks hanging out there should be we should start a Kickstarter for just realer kiosks populated popular trails running routes yeah we're kiosks are set up well yeah I wasn't even doing for most of my run today I wasn't even doing a trail I was going down lo borro which is around by the Mexican ambassador's residence and the and the reservoir so that wasn't yeah I wouldn't have come across a kiosk anyways well I hope we know we'll still running sounds like Travis is still playing overwatch uh yeah yeah all right seriously I'm not getting any better is there a lady character that eats a lot of Doritos in that game with headphones on kind of yes and no there is a character in that game who's a the full Baberaham yeah that the character is supposed to be a professional gamer and she like operates a Mac in the game and so because she's a pro gamer the fan base in their artwork of her often depict her guzzling Mountain Dew and eating a lot of Doritos so yes and no there is that character but it's really stereotypical but it's also kind of funny don't buy that game Steve I've played enough of that game did you read box it no I I was in the beta I was in the early beta before they gave beta access to everyone so I probably put about 20 hours in Oh intriguing and the betas it was the full game there they didn't change anything when they release the game presides like reset your stats how'd you get in on that you just pre-ordered it on amazon and then they they gave it to you i think on like monday and then they gave everyone else access on thursday and then they extended it like an extra couple days so i play the entire time paid so high you you got it you pre-ordered on amazon you played the beta uh-huh and then you said this game is not for me and you cancelled your order you're a hundred percent right wow it's almost like stealing if the game would be for me if it was twenty bucks but it's sixty dollars on ps4 and there's just not enough content there's not enough game there yeah even though I like it a lot i've put about 30 ish hours 30 35 hours into it and everyone has said this and has already said it more eloquently than I have but even on PC $40 seems like a strange price to pay for a game with two game modes for just play the game or play the game with little wacky rules thoroughness I think more zone control like those are your only two modes they do every week they hadn't they they don't add they rotate out different game modes like the one that was I don't remember what the one is like right now with the one last week was mystery hero so every time you died it would resurrect you as a different here you hero that you couldn't switch out up so they have like little they call them brawls similar to how hearthstone has the tavern brawl that's what out every week but but just like that and then the normal quick play seems like a little sparse it doesn't really matter to me just because I find it to be a good game to play after a day of doing whatever it's a good game don't wind down for me so I don't really care but if I were not already inclined towards that type of game I would be a little weirded out by the price tag especially on consoles well somebody should do like a research project because I think you can pretty easily say nowadays that if something is a triple a game it's going to be sixty dollars period right triple-a has to be sixty dollars even if it's going to come with expansions later those expansions cost more money but it didn't always used to be that way like games were really priced more towards like what the projected demand was going to be and there was a lot of variation in the pricing of games but now it's like it doesn't matter if you're a five-hour game or a hundred our game if you're a triple a game then you're sixty dollars so somebody figure out what day and date that occurred and what was the what is it it was the release of the eyetoy for the playstation 2 everything just went downhill from there I mean I'm I don't really care how much a game pause / content there and that sounds hypocritical from what I just said earlier but like I played paid twenty dollars for fire watch and fire watch a very short experience and not much changes in it and then you know I complained because overwatch was sixty dollars and the only difference between the sixty dollars on ps4 and the forty dollars on PC was there was a think six or eight exclusive skins and tomorrow at tornado alley yeah that's that's not worth like give me the forty dollar option on ps4 I probably but it would have been more likely to buy it also as will elegantly put it earlier in episode I am a game gobbler i gobbled my 20 to 25 hours in the beta knowing that if i paid forty more or 60 more dollars i would get exactly what I just consumed and I felt good at like I felt was like I got what I wanted to in the beta like yes I could continue paying I could continue to play this but i don't want to pay that much money to continue to play this like if it was in front of me yeah I'd play it I'd have fun it's the shooter great cool but like I have other stuff to play and i am one that i appreciate the the search like the grind the I want that carrot on a stick and there's none of that in overwatch you don't get you don't get that rush when you get a loop box and level up in here I don't like the costumes are cool but they don't do it like it's not the same as a new gun destiny where the perks are different and it's like I have four auto rifles but this auto rifle has this perk which may or may not be better but it's still something that I could shuffle through no idea what yeah and sarcastic but i mean like steve is a sucker for like they just pours his money into the most ridiculous things because right Travis you don't pay attention to destiny so you don't know this but they've announced like they're returning one of the most popular rocket launchers to destiny gallop horn um but like if you have a pre-order or something special it's like you can get the black gala Warren ok everybody else can't and steve is like I've already written my check cuz I've got to have the black oh it's packaged I've already it's pretty ordered Steve I was actually looking at destiny on the Xbox one just the other day and guess how much all current destiny content everything even with the special pre-order upgrades and everything I think it's our sale this week because of their announcement it's like a thirty dollars for everything at thirty dollars for everything and then how much for all the add-ons the special class items and set etc oh I don't know those are probably another like 20-40 so it comes to 40 for everything yeah and how much did you pay to get everything Oh easily you know a hundred I probably put like five hundred dollars into destiny because of Albany all the dances um yeah I mean I've put a ton of money into destiny because I you know got the ps4 for it and the Vita for it but I've also I've also approached 1600 hours into destiny so the dollar to our ratio i think is is was worth my wild there are other games with dollar to our wishing if you're if it really is five hundred dollars that you spent in 1600 hours they put in that's still three dollars 3.2 dollars an hour which that's an expensive arcade cabinet Wow but the memories Travis the the mem Pokemon is a thing how much of that how much her there how much of that bring these conversations just gonna get cut I thought it was good spending like 40 minutes talking about how much money we spend on video game it was about 15 minutes I was looking at the timer because we had three minutes of you slip it up before we went into sound right three minutes of dreams a bell hottie mouse there's only like there's only like 15 of our 15 listeners that heard it and we have quite a bit of listeners so that's a very small very small market alright let's start off with some pokemon news we will start off with the zorro of pork pokemon zygarde wait now is our darkest deserve Pokemon does Zorich drawers ease on things when it shoots off its it does I don't think it does with one move you just don't know Zoroark as well as I do now zygarde is the Zorro the mast I don't even know what Zorro's catchphrases the masked Avenger he says hey I've got a sword hey guess what you're gonna get cut up there uh there was a YouTube was at the YouTube video it was a premiered at the Taiwan national championships which they had that's what I was confused were they Ansel no that was the giant that was the Hong Kong video footage of zygarde ten percent form and zygarde complete form in Pokemon Sun and Moon has been revealed originally aired at the 2016 Taiwan Pokemon video game national championships which has been uploaded the official Japanese youtube channel Pokemon youtube channel the official japanese youtube channel all I think it's on the English Channel now too okay zygarde ten percent form was shown using moves thousand waves and thousand arrows these moves exist in the code in generation six but they are currently unobtainable when at low HP zygarde ten percent form which one is tempers is that the dog the doggy okay ten percent form ability swarm chain when at low HP zygarde ten percent forms ability swarm change activates changing it into complete form and restoring HP zygarde complete form was shown using a new move called core enforcer this move has a long animation which like our raises into the air prepares energy orbs at his chest and then shoots down Abby and draws AZ shape on top of the target which then burst into fire while the type has not been revealed it was a super effective damage to a Garchomp oh so it's obviously ice haha bar is flying good against ground no it'd be there ice or dragon it's it's probably a dragon-type move honestly probably yeah where or if we're doing really it could be one of the I mean we've seen with jen 6 we saw moves like freeze dry and flying press that are a bit of a strange take on how super effective works or even how move typing work so could even be something like that is ten percent form the the one that stayed or that ten percent complete form that's like the robot one yeah got it we'd like the snake head as its chest yep yeah fifty fifty percent is the one that we know and love from x and y oh yeah it's like a salamander when with a strange pad dress um ten percent cobra the are baka my toes I was gonna yeah you're right I can I'll just leave that is now be ten percent of the dog cell there is like a little yeah and there's core zygarde which is like another amoeba like an one and then complete is the Robo guys not actually a robot but it is it a Vox it evokes like Max yeah and if anybody hasn't watched the footage from the Taiwan national championships i recommend it just because it's obviously the first reveal of that ability that converts ten percent warm into complete form and the hype in that room was so real there's someone young like no no no no the whole the whole broom like you so you can hear like hundreds of people who are like shocked that this is happening in front of it it's amazing it's like infectious tubes and you get all hype for like super zygarde and then you start you shed a little tear because i guard never got got his game well we only really have these two articles the zygarde one in the one I'm about to talk about so light on news except the two news articles we have our kind of important things i guard still important tiger it's still relevant still relevant yeah there will be after we finish this podcast III will be starting i believe it starts at three p.m. central time and I opens up with EA and then I think ubisoft is later tonight and then tomorrow of course it being Microsoft Tony and then on Tuesday Nintendo yeah and tender will have their treehouse of horror yep so we'll probably get more Pokemon news i am i confident we'll get a new trailer for sun and moon i'm also I'm also confident that they're gonna say Pokemon go beta for everyone starting like this week I feel like they're gonna do that especially was a chance that they don't even mention Pokemon go because they don't want to confuse people you get people confused between Sun and Moon and Pokemon go maybe but like Pokemon go has to come out before sun and moon right like that yet that is the that is the hype train for the summer leading people to go like oh yeah pokemons cool again let's get under 3ds and also who got invited to this beta it wasn't me well Travis wasn't will well I don't have any phone that can play that game so I feel like no one got invited clearly people got invited a lot of people i knows friends got invited to it yeah the way I heard it I got a friend who got invited but I didn't yeah i was talking to Ellen from my other podcast i do the tuesday my podcast and he was like how's the Pokemon go beta and I was like I didn't I didn't get in he's look what do you mean you didn't get in and I was like I signed up like everyone else and I didn't get in and he's like oh my my friend so-and-so got in and I was like that's all I ever hear is my friend got in i think a lot of people are claiming they got in but it's not true yeah I mean it's at the end of the world I just think it's ed I just think it's funny because there were a lot of people very excited to get in and the the ratio to people who got into people who wanted to get in is very off that's how bad is work oh yeah unless you're over watch then you pay up front for the beta and then you can select you get um alright the big news here Cora Cora it's this little magazine in Japan I love I'm sure that coro coro has a purpose other than show a showing Pokemon things when a new game is coming out but it's weird that in the unless unless it does reveals for other games that I don't know about it's weird to me that in the West it's only known as that magazine that will occasionally show Pokemon things because I don't even know what that magazine is about is it a visit a video game magazine or is it just a magazine about something else that occasionally talks about pokemon pokemon I think it's one of those like it's kind of like um I'm probably gonna say this the wrong way they put magazine Nickelodeon money baby I was gonna say like teen beat or Tiger Beat where it's like some of it is fan service for video games not that kind of a beat it's more like a news reporters beat sir and reportedly met the have like manga you think you're funny Oh were hilarious the thing I know they'll have like some manga episodes because you know a lot of manga is delivered episodic Lee and then like shonen jump right that has like mango snippets so I think it's that kind of a thing because like you know I cuz I'm I'm also familiar with Cairo Cairo a switch does a lot of the reveals of the Buescher road and the bushy road cardfight vanguard I know the mangas sewed say it again is that the sequel aussie road now Crossy Road so good no stop this is Pokemon time um did you know did you know that boo she wrote Owens new japan pro wrestling that I didn't know what I my vote was they barely know and a guard I only know bushy road because of gencon well they own new japan pro wrestling anyways back to magazines I think there are several magazines in Japan that are kind of like corporate mouthpieces or have exclusive contracts to reveal information for various corporate entities ok alright in this manner yet I have two thoughts on Cora Cora one is we only see two to four pages of Cora Cora every month i wiii am very curious what the rest of that magazine looks like maybe even like the cover of it i have no clue what is there look I have somebody in Japan says mail you a copy yeah I should I should ask I should ask Andrew to this point to is the initial person only one person in Japan has a daisy camera on their cell phone and they kind of take bad pictures every month I don't know who you know corocoro photographer is that sends these over to bulbapedia and savvy and you know all these other internet outlets yourself a DSLR dude but wyd why does it why is it only one picture why do we only have one picture of the page why is this person not taking two or three pictures get us some different angles get us some good lighting maybe outside by the pond and maybe maybe invest in a scanner yeah I just I don't understand what's going on here what why are we living in this year two thousand of taking pictures of magazines I don't understand I just don't get it it's the it's the modern equivalent to the camcorder let's play it just like reminds me of like somebody's sitting in a movie theater with a camcorder just recording the movie like they're all digital now just no s the guy who's making 750 an hour if you can get the flash drive oh now dude the projector people's union the union of projectionists ah they make a money not the big I'm not not you know sixteen-year-old 750 and our guy that's flip and turn on when that dude is not running the projector I guarantee it all right trust me I find yourself somebody who runs a projector for movie theaters you'll find out what a scam that is yeah rejection let's make more money than like the person cleaning popcorn or whatever okay learning something new here all right more importantly back to coro coro if we were planning about this for a reason this month's Cora Cora really filled two new pokemon these I these have to be Japanese names these cannot be the English names because they're not punny enough to the animals they represent the first one is Nick Aurora and I winco I nwankwo doesn't it doesn't even matter how they're gonna change neca wallah there's no L in neck Aurora I saw an L in there oh it's any kk o AR a oh well I think because in in Japanese they don't have the L sound so there's no distinction between the r and Elsa yeah I see alright so air so it would almost like that cuz isn't it more of like a oh the strip is the r / l sounded like the strange love child of our L&D so it'd be like Nicole Audra so probably something along those lines very similar to the to the short are in portuguese i met i think all right we broke Steve yeah and then the other one's a dog cool yeah i'll forget a koala one is the good one I've already forgotten these names I will I can't even remember what the starters names in Japan were that art is now popular Lytton and rowlett I don't even know what the original deppen oh yeah those were like really long and difficult to understand so the DA let's start with the DA the quote let's start with the Koala the good one the good one the koala is a normal type of Pokemon it has the ability sure sleeper too cool ability the new one Travis will explain what it does in a second here nah it is known for dreaming it is known as The Dreaming Pokemon it appears to be based on the koala it's one foot eight inches American height it weighs 20 American pounds it's oh and Travis will let you know what the ability yeah if i remember right I'll look it up and correct myself later if i'm wrong but if I remember it correctly the only status effect that can affect it is sleep so it's immune to poison paralysis burn freeze it's it's just it's so sleepy guy and I thought that it's like it was considered to be perpetually asleep so actually even the sleep status concession wouldn't affect it because it's considered to already be asleep no I think I sins go to sleep yeah I can go to sleep it just can't be paralyzed or poisoned or yeah the ability sure sleeper prevents it from being afflicted by status conditions other than sleep haha yep and then the dog is a rock-type pokemon this is the little dog that we saw in the second trailer of Sun and Moon the one that was right outside the house when the trainer left the house mmm I don't know of a second trailer but yeah well it was a special coro coro tree I was a special cork or trailer wasn't like this second English paler it has the ability keen eye and vital spirit abilities keen eye and vital spirit it is known as the puppy Pokemon it appears to be based on a dog it is one foot four inches tall weighs 44 pounds the pokemon and previously yeah it appeared in the other trailer Kenai what is that you can't say an attack doesn't work yeah you your accuracy cannot be lowered and then vital spirit prevents um sleep inmate you can't fall asleep that's the opposite of shore sleep in a way yeah I I'm assuming these are your two Pokemon that appear early on I guess you have liked to that well then there they'll need to add in a bird but right yeah but yeah I mean when they showed fletching and whatever other Pokemon it was like those were the two you saw early on watch hog and what pat rad i should say and Trat lilla pop and who's the bird of pidove hey remember remember this old it's super effective mean a lollipop lollipop Ali I remember that sorry don't remember remember last week when I said I bet these new legendary pokémon will have alternative forms well so gay leo has a ton of form known as rising phase in which it is described being like the Sun in this phase and that is run here the bag that is the pokemon that's supposed to be the Sun is described as being like the Sun in a different form or the fact that a Pokemon that is that or the fact that like the Bulba news or whatever you're reading off of article described the new dog Pokemon which is listed as the puppy pokemon as being a dog like an appearance well because it's rock type so yeah it's cool that maybe it's like a bonsly or something I feel like this is bones Lee this this puppy is going to turn into like a diggersby of like whoa I didn't expect that did you just say what is it bones Lee yeah what is that it's the thing that's the pre evolution of sudowoodo but that's bonsly ice bonsly bonsly it's all the same Oh Lord it doesn't have an e it's not like it's not like a rejected undertale character how do you how do you say the name of the the band of the guy he's things by himself and he's from wisconsin and uses a french name for his band boney there yes that's because he's French you don't call it Bonnie but yep no he's not French he's American he's what whatever the name is French I don't know it's a good winner or whatever because apparently people like winter which is absurd it's the worst season agreed so gaily Oh have you know internalized therefore known as the rising phase I don't think that is an alternative form in this phase it appears more radiant and its color colored accents become more yellow so Gallio is seen in this phase during the animation for its signature move sunstrike this informations off bulbapedia bulbapedia by the way loon allah has a alternative form known as the full moon phase in which it said in which it said to Paul the moon in this phase its wings glow white highlighted with the skeletal structure loon Allah is seen in this phase during the animation for signature moon move moon guys to beam I don't think that's a form-change like we think of form-change where it actually changes the stats of the Pokemon I think it's just a cosmetic change to their parents as they're about to perform a certain attack or something you're probably right but like at this point with curium form and jamin form and which all changed the stats of Amelia genesect forms and Deena's form and beyond or their precedent for a Pokemon with a form-change that's purely cosmetic I don't think so ah I don't know I but out these things have to have alternative forms like what main series legendary Pokemon have we gotten that haven't gone down this road right but all of them zygarde xerneas like or just like 17 forms not yet xerneas and yveltal don't have alternate forms ah do they not they do not one looks like a shiny bacon though that's i'm so tired of your making fun of my bird of district destruction bacon of destruction mcgarin migire now that's a Pokemon that still exists here has a new ability called soul heart which can raise its special attacks that the trigger is not currently known it can learn a new move called flee or cannon floral blur blur or cannon there's somebody remember in my hair Harry Potter how there is the french girl fleur de liquor yeah yes clear and then finally a special pokemon gail a disc will include a QR code to obtain migire nuh in Pokemon Sun and Moon this migire now will be level 50 have the ability so heart know the moves fleer of floor canon flash cannon lucky chant and helping hand I'm gonna continue my trend in the last few episodes of interrupting you to correct a thing I said a little earlier keldeo is a pokemon that's two forms that are purely cosmetic in their differences wait Aleutian no resolution form changes the stats I don't believe it does Oh disturb let me get on the internet to dispute this yeah oh yeah like Landorus and them have different forms yeah but those are the first also have your stats I know I just like every legendary mythical Pokemon has a million forms it's fine it's whatever it's just it gets confusing at some point because those because these forms like they're day they don't follow a certain pattern right I don't think there's any difference between resolute form and whatever you would call the normal and what's the point of having resolute form because it's cool that if you get the right move on it it changes its appearance and it's a little yeah that's that's make restored it's like a little like ooh the big question here is what's the point does it change its ability nope I mean I could be wrong but I but I pretty sure if memory serves I haven't it's been a while since I've had any competitive team that had a Calvillo on it and a dozen as you if you're playing against a Cal do I don't remember having to remember any difference when if it is in resolute or the ordinary form when fighting against it so on the TCG Cal do can Russian yes I guess it's uh it's just uh it learns it gets the move secret sword it's just so whatever mmm yeah keldeo had like the worst pokemon movie of all so there you go that mean it makes sense it makes sense you know what else makes sense that we're done with news and we should take break when we come back we have I got three emails pulled up i have um I have some pin debacle that we can talk about and then our pokemon of the week you and we are back sometimes it broke so long sometimes they are not now let's do some emails here if you want to send us an email you can do so SBJ at pkmn cast calm you can also go to Pokemon podcast calm hit that contact button two ways to email whichever way is easier for you will read any and all emails eventually let's go through our emails this one is from Chris see hi spj will Travis and anyone else that could be on at this moment I'm a young listener as in the seventh grade I listen to your show as often as I can I have been interested in Pokemon since I was two when I first saw it on TV all I remember is that since then I've been saving up all my allowance for cars toys and games the latter was kind of difficult until I got a my Nintendo 2ds in Pokemon y which i still play I have one question that i would appreciate you being answered on the show I was wondering which type you think has the most Pokemon without looking it up online thanks for reading Chris from Michigan hmm it's either water or normal I know the answer and I didn't look it up i'm gonna guess water yeah it is water i actually don't know what the second most i think the second most might be normal flying has to be up there too yes most lying types are normal so right you all right there's a lot of normal pokemon that like Jigglypuff well Jaclyn well they're also normal fairy but she have wreck your piggies your raddatz has your Bidoof your Stoutland Lily pups Patrat are you just gonna list all Pokemon ago cuz we can we'll be here awhile that would be quite the episode are we correct before we move on we better actually make sure that we're right that water is the most populous tight oh it actually might be normal Oh No then we'll wins I'm on this bulbapedia article so I don't know the abundance of Pokemon type combinations it says Wow this doesn't seem right because they're separating it out by this normal has 60 but normal flying has 23 so just straight if we're looking at a straight single type Pokemon normal as the most in 64 look at straight water-type pokemon it's number two with 58 and then straight grass-type pokémon as 33 but then that's not taking in account like flying bug there are 14 flying bugs 20 you're fighting 23 normal flying with a very detailed chart its scientific yeah 26 straight electric 15 straight fairy three dragon dark to ice Dark One ice dragon what's the one ice dragon psyche curium kiram yes 0 electric psychic i think the zeros are more exciting zero electric dark0 electric psychic zero fire fairy zero fire grass well that would be cool grass fire yeah you could be like a Savannah Pokemon zero steel ice zero gonna wear a wire in grass has to do with a city in Georgia no bug fairy no bug dark no bug dragon no bug ice no bugs psychic wow that's a lot of types that could be done no rock electric no rock ghost really no rock no ghostly right there's a ghost ground before oh oh yeah that's what I was thinking of no ground fairy no poison fairy poison fire nope poison steel nope fighting fairy nope fighting ghosts nope normal ice normal dragon normal dark that's all I know normal Rock normal bug normal ghost also know there's a lot of types there's no dark fairy type Pokemon so we're not going to get the pokemon equivalent to the neopets video game on the playstation 2 the darkest faerie no fire ice I don't know how that would work but I mean we have fire water yeah that would make sense cuz it's like steam yeah steam it's like Obama snow like grass ice that makes sense cuz it's like a tree like a winter tree well you got me there well kiram w couldn't been fire ice but they decided not to do that right yeah what a good question though I'm amazed at how many types don't have don't exist like fighting Fairy and I'm glad that for a seventh grader we can provide a level of appropriate humor coming from Travis you're never gonna let me live that joke down yeah we'll probably will probably forget by next week but Luke be wrightson in all caps hey the Shaymin guarantee no movie is so good sorry for that I am Luke by the way you guys are my favorite Pokemon podcasts to listen to by far much better than insert bad Pokemon podcast here I'm not making that that's what it says so you guys can mean that then this thing the thing about that shows you'd expect them to at least come up with a title will is my favorite co-host not saying I don't like Travis or Logan now I get it question is fair question do any of you play pokin or smash and will be willing to play I know what plays destiny I know you will play destiny with the PS hashtag ps4 or less I started listening you guys around episode 160 and you got me to play pokemon and you all got me to play pokemon shuffle yet i never got into it and quit the day and quit one day in in my opinion pokemon ranger is one of the most underrated spin-off games in the Pokemon universe or should I say the multiverse the game is so good if you haven't played it in my opinion it's one of the best games isn't there like four Ranger games yeah your shadows of Almia you got your guardian signs you got your original pokemon ranger which I don't think had a subtitle and I and that does the only ones i remember in my opinion it is the best because of so many features and it's extremely fun back in has extremely fun back in time and make it so much more fun that you should try it thanks for reading one last thing keep up the good work so the pokemon ranger we were talking about this on twitter but the pokemon ranger games have gotten re released for the wii u virtual console i know they have been in Europe but I don't know if they have been in the States I wouldn't be surprised if they were announced week that would be sweet accept no special missions so you can't get the manaphy egg I've know them up and find a way to edit or fix that because they definitely did that for red and blue and yellow but I I don't I guess what what's the point because you can download manaphy right now yes exactly there's there's really no point to it right alright last question here is from uh tanta bus dude it's in front of you I have no idea what I'm going with it sounds like a word my apologies if I slaughtered your name they write in you wake up with a pounding headache after a night of drinking an unhealthy amount of pokey potions you don't know where you are and you are approached by for Pokemon a gardevoir a jinx a lopunny any breaks and each of them carrying an egg they all claim to have bread with your ditto this is getting weird anyways I just sounds like a typical Saturday morning you may choose one egg to raise as your own which one do you choose and which one do you send to the distorted dimension may Arceus have mercy on their souls what what were my options again Gardevoir jinx lopunny and bricks and breaks and why would i send any of them to the distortion world when you can only pick one that means the other ones you know you don't know what happened to why can I only pick one I have a sufficient income and I'm a responsible adult hey I I didn't write the team of six yeah travis you go first because I'm completely emotionally wrecked by this question Gardevoir is a cool pokemon and it does lead to a lot of options right because you could that egg could turn into a guarded dude um what's his name Mike it's like I'm having a brain freeze Gallade guillod could turn into a god I remember our man and gar woman my two favorite pokemon i said gardna dude there's i was listening to the mix ler we've come full circle and that was it i think it was like episode 112 / 113 it was when we first started talking about fairy type or maybe even prior to that and I remember Travis being slightly upset because Gardevoir would become a fairy type yeah but I think if I like it now I've I I've come around very cool fairies a really really cool type one of my favorites not I mean it's no ice type but it's good I just don't remember things well I'm supposed to remember new type effectiveness effective knees I mean I'm with you mostly about the million different forms pokemon can have no if I was to pick one of these eggs they'd probably be the Braxtons because I like delphox and I like fennekin a lot now I go for probably lopunny because megan lopunny is real cool yeah it is yeah oh we didn't answer the fighting type yep yo the previous email asked if we played smash or pokin how we okay i completely forgot about that yeah i mean if enough people wanted to get together and play pokin one night I'd be all for that but i don't i don't play pokin just nightly I don't have a wii u I've gotta come to terms with I've reached my quota and how good I could be at pokin and it's not very good I'm really bad I just button mash in that game I don't even try give me gengar and and that's all I go for go to town with that ooh but I actually did pretty well with Chandelure tune to Simmons yeah Gendler school you can't can't complain with that book 1 alright let's jump over to pokemon center com start about spoke might an item of the week we have my mother if there was a scandal is not really a scandal not not a lot of these pins have reviews but the team rocket logo zubat Rattata pokémon pin it is a three pack for 1899 they have some reviews you going to give us the link so i can read it in a funny voice yeah yeah i'll send it over where is where there it is we have so many versions of this chat open get a lot of technical difficulties before the show still jolteon watch still no doubt jolteon 10 in the store i will i will read the first review here lovely pins by Ariel n quotation meu from California just got these today and I love them they are pretty nice size and the pica shaped pin holder is a nice touch to the only thing I can complain about is the lack of me out in this set since it's the Team Rocket Pokemon still awesome pins and I'm surely buying another set to five out of five pokeballs I'm just jay i'm just spoiled by how good that review was last week yeah yeah we got I've been great I don't think we're gonna top it but Travis do you want to read the other review here yeah I'll read the name last because that's the only funny part this is a 4 out of 5 pokeballs review one out of three people found it helpful these are great pin collections I just wished that with the team rocket logo they included the Pokemon from the show coughing in Atkins otherwise these are awesome and that's by dunk master three the pokey master it's weird that a okay I want to like these pins but when you're selling me three pins for $19 boo and one of them is just an R that's it says hard to swallow it doesn't even have multiple colors it's just like a pinkish are will do under great the bullet points and how they're trying to sell you this are you down with Team Rocket grab this awesome Pokemon pin 3 pack featuring the team rocket logo and two of Team Rocket's favorite Pokemon number one team rocket team pack with team logo in the Pokemon zubat and ratata number two official Pokemon pins hungry number three Pokemon Center original recommended age six years in op country of origin made in China material type zinc alloy hard enamel item weight point one American pounds item dimensions point two five American inches seven American inches height 3.8 American inches length I really really doubt these are seven American inches tall probably the box look really something choking hazard small parts not for children under three years functional sharp shiny points and contains functional sharp points not for children who or seven months out now it's not for children under four years looks like at three you can show at three you know like I shouldn't swallow a thing that's gonna kill me but you don't know I shouldn't poke a thing into me that wolf I shouldn't hurt so it says functional sharp points not for children then above it says recommended age six years and up would you I I think just because of the mature themes yes those five year olds are in the gray zone I I know a lot of two-year-olds and three-year-olds I can't I don't know I haven't been around a six-year-old a while and clearly in two to three years I will be around a six-year-old because kids spoiler they their age gets older with time but would would you give up into spoiled the ending of kids all right would you give up into a six-year-old I feel like that's still kind of dangerous calm pins are pretty sharp okay so the issue isn't the kids themselves it's it's the parents and there are a lot of really dumb parents out there because it does not take any kind of education to have a baby but it actually raised one properly takes a little bit of intelligence so that's yeah accra see we know that that he knows narrative that gap is where people are using the team rocket pins to hold the diaper together um so mmm that's what you got to watch out for I also don't think like a six-year-old would be that enthralled with a pin like yeah you could put on their bag and they probably would leave it alone but I feel like they're short attention span would be okay I got the pin now I don't care moving on to the next toy in line also why is that you can i plug it into my Skylanders nevitt bite why is it a zoo bed in a rattata why is it not a coughing urine Ekans well okay okay okay I have a little bone to pick with that particular argument because team rocket changes out there like the pokemon that they use as the generations go on so honestly if you really wanted the core pokemon that they truly love and feel are part of their team you'd want to boba fett enemy out because well the fat keeps coming back I don't think the team rocket from the anime I think it's supposed to be team rocket from generations 12 and they would often use Rattata and zoo bet there's also that you are correct yeah but aren't you going for mass appeal now apparently not clearly not all right Pokemon the week this week's pokémon of the week is stoutland the normal type pokemon pokemon the big hard animal type Pokemon the big-hearted pokemon as the pokedex claims involves from her tier which evolves from Lily pup it is well Lily pop I feel like is the original puppy Pokemon I agree but now getting passed up from this new generation 7 the hot stuffs coming in and push and Lily pup and stout went off to the side and it was my first shiny lillybot no well I yeah I caught it as a little pup but I evolved it into a stoutland interesting southland is a canine Pokemon with a talent for rescuing people lost at sea what wait a second install and learn surf uh possible I I think it connect again yeah I just scroll down alright fair enough let's continue reading solid as a canine Pokemon with the talent for rescuing people lost at sea or in the mountains on its face and as a cream it has cream colored fur that forms a volume asst white-tipped plumes and a three-point crest the plumes are so long that they run the length of its body and bunch close to it it has a toughy it has Tuffy pointed ears with blue insides a black nose surrounded by the short black whiskers and small eyes that are nearly hidden behind its facial fur his body is covered with shaggy fur that is dark blue along the back and grayish blue towards the legs this first thick enough to protect itself against freezing temperatures its face and paws our light brown and each paw has three toes with white claws blue paw pads can be seen on each paw in the pokédex 3d pro app product placement there fifty percent male fifty percent female travis has moveset Stalin is really cool pokemon specifically because it gets access to sand rush which is an ability that makes it so that well first you're immune to the effects of sandstorm you're immune to the damaging effects of stand storm but more importantly your speed is doubled under sandstorm we can do is run stoutland in a sand team with a choice band so your speed goes from the normal 80 which isn't that great to 160 when you're under sandstorm which is a lot and your attack is already 110 which is quite good so slap a choice band on there and you're not only going to be out speeding a lot of Pokemon but you're going to be one heck a owing a lot of them even a lot of walls too because you're just dishing out so much damage for v's as you say you're going to do an adamant nature with 250 2 v's and attack and speed for in HP or defense or something and in terms of moves you want return just for the highest base attack normal move you can get your hands on crunch so I guess in going into crunch and the other moves the other ones will just give you better type coverage and since we're doing choice band we just basically want for attacking moves so we're gonna do return crunch super power and shoot what's the electric move its wild wild charge yeah wild charge so you're so so its return crunch super power and wild charge it gives you a pretty good type coverage and I mean just a normal type on its own gives you good type coverage with the exception of steel and rock and although and both of those you you cover with superpowers you've got a lot of your types cover oh and and ghost you don't have but you can get that with with crunch so you've got a lot of types covered and you're doing a lot of damage with a pretty regal looking dog did you said sand rush as the ability yeah yeah because otherwise like I think in so so Stoutland actually got some play in VGC 2011 when the rules stipulated that you could only use you know a Pokemon if I remember correctly it was the used the intimidate ability because I don't think I think we saw whether that very much that year because there we didn't have access to Pokemon that would set it up yeah immediately Tyrannis r is your typical sand streamer right right which we didn't have access to and I don't think there any you know a Pokemon that did I mean it's like again that was five years ago so my memory is a little hazy but I think in that version they ran the and they ran it with intimidate because that ability is just so great in doubles because it hits both the opponent's and if I remember right that was a pretty physically heavy meta that year so I think there is a stoutland maybe even on the winning team that sort of caught people by surprise but other than that you're typically going to see it with sand rush because that's going to cover the weakness of the only 80 speed tiny stoutland is definitely shiny it's more of a green than a blue and is its face whiskers which are normally like a cream color they're like a gold which is really cool will has one yes are you said are you satisfied with the shininess of your shiny um I I think I'm very happy with it I can't remember if I gave that one away or not but the golden many pokeballs out of 5 would you give it I'd say a 4 4 out of 5 yeah because that golden mane is like what makes it yeah uh not that much trivia here southland was based on the comp finish combination of a shi zhu zhu zhu and a Maltese with some characteristics of a yorkshire's and as Scottish terrier it's talented wish every kind of dog right its talent for rescuing humans and mountains is similar to the st. Bernard I don't know dogs that well so it doesn't mean much to me st. Bernard is the one that has the Cask of like brandy around its neck mmm wow that just shows our age difference of guys that used to be in all the cartoons oh we we we should just jump back a little bit and talk about our thoughts with the koala and dog we didn't actually do that oh the koalas cool alright good we gonna bility it's it's hugging a little stumped which is funny cuz wall is hang onto trees it's cute are there where are their koalas in Hawaii there are no koalas all right there are booked months so unreal what are the stomach pouch mammals called kozue peels marsupials so marsupials are only in Australia and koalas are marsupials all right what I was going to say is every year at the pokemon company international there is a contest to determine who will design the pokemon that can sell the most plushies who will sell the most stuffed animals and obviously these are two top contenders because people are going to buy neck o Allah merchandise until the end of days because it's going to be everybody's favorite one to have as a stuffed animal do you think the Koala is going to go down the same path as what is it pangoro as it going to turn dark or just like uh no like a slack King where they're just like that so easy I think it's gonna be like a slack off vigorous lacking kind of deal where it's gonna like have a middle evolution that's like has what is it well vital spirits one of them but there's another one where it can't ever fall asleep insomnia and Sonia is that what worry seed gives you yeah I gives you the ability but I think there might even be a third one that that's the same effect I just like then we already had a level ooh she will be more like super bulky and super sleepy also I looked it up and there are marsupials in the American continent possums yeah something like that but it just says on the wikipedia page it says there are a 100 species of marsupials found in the Americas particularly in South America but 13 in Central America and one lonely species in North America in the north of Mexico which is what possum oh I guess this is north of Mexico so maybe now because there's no possums in mex Mexico possums are up here oh yeah there I don't we've already seen like that sleeping lazy Pokemon in like slacking and Snorlax it is that the main we've already seen doug pokemon or yet another one why you've always be another way kokum we're getting a rock dog that's a little different but it's i think i mean its ability is the main quality of a co-op to sleep no but they're super cute yeah but aren't they also like super dangerous don't like more people die from koalas than they do I don't think that's true but i do believe or koala attacks in shark attacks he heard it here first I believe that koalas are more violent than people expect them to be I would be okay with like I don't know like a very attack heavy mobile evolution of the sleepy koala instead of going down like the oh it's just like another Snorlax I was gonna say if your entire diet consisted of one kind of leaf you'd be in pretty bad mood as well what about what about the daughter dinner today Oh eucalyptus again yo ever exact pan Reza that life is it know Nana's and koalas just eat eucalyptus Oh pandas eat bamboo dude oh yeah a bamboo it up all right rock dog I'm showing my ignorance all right so I immediately got angry texts and and otherwise about what makes this dog rock and to that I would answer with the question what makes a gogoat grass what makes a chair a jar look I'm out of college those days about those days of philosophizing of the essence of a chair behind me I would rather keep it that way is a hot dog a sandwich would you stop stop this we do not need to lower the intelligence quality of this book podcast any lower than it has already fallen it's I mean I did just say that pandas only eucalyptus and and somehow you managed to make it more done than that um so it has a stone collar that's what makes it a rock-type mystery solved also i can matt i can imagine why you know how dogs when they're wet they do they like to shake off they like shake off the waters I don't know what the technical term of that it's called a perfect yeah so I can imagine with my imagination when you go with the rock dog shakes but instead of water coming off like little pebbles come out of it oh that's one dirty dog you know it you know it i like my dog's dirty is that gonna be the new tagline of it's super effective it's super effective what a dirty dog but I think I think that's good to lay out a Pokemon and say this is its this is a this what it does and for you to like imagine that like oh yeah I could I could imagine that Pokemon being real sure it's I mean the only pokemon I imagine not being real is Basque alone but we can move on from that I mean n board is normal type or not I'm bore a pyro laura's normal type for some reason so as it is not normal fire yeah it's a weird one yeah Rock doggy wow that's cool I'm happy with both these Pokemon drapion is dark type for some reason drapion it that looks poison bug real cool drapion is a very cool welcome on but it doesn't make sense why it's dark while loops because it's or evil and it is buggy so the evil / fight dirty it's a it's a it's a it's a dirty pokémon trip it's super effective what a Dorito patreon if you want to support the dirtiest of dogs patreon.com/scishow perfective we might do a mini podcast sometime this week depending on the Sun and Moon news we may or may not get depending on the phase of the moon so we're on

get a room and my my request was a little bit later than it should have been but Jen Khan came back and they said well we can give you a room with AV equipment microphone speakers but it can only hold 60 people and that would cost money because the AV stuff or we can give you a room that holds a hundred people with no AV stuff for free so I took the room with no AV stuff because I would rather have it hold more people and I'll figure something out I have my own speakers i have i had i can make something work so i don't even know what's in this room I don't know if there's aI don't know if there's tables there's clearly not a microphone or speakers which don't I have a solution for but it's very last minute there are tickets if you go to gencon calm if you are going to gencon just
