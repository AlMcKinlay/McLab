Oh (0:12 - 0:14)
what's up everyone welcome to the 220 (0:20 - 0:27)
a--the episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:24 - 0:34)
I'm your hostess bj and with me is you (0:27 - 0:38)
know this whole mix lair thing is is (0:34 - 0:41)
really ruining my normal rhythm normally (0:38 - 0:45)
I make some joke that normally we all (0:41 - 0:46)
make a lot of jokes that we would never (0:45 - 0:49)
make in front of other people and even (0:46 - 0:51)
though you told me hey we're going on (0:49 - 0:56)
mix alert now I forgot about that no I'm (0:51 - 1:00)
still a little shaken by the by the (0:56 - 1:03)
middle school joke I made about two (1:00 - 1:05)
minutes ago I always like to imagine (1:03 - 1:07)
that you know travis has been on since (1:05 - 1:11)
like 31 so we're 220 now minus 30 (1:07 - 1:13)
episodes you've been on for about give (1:11 - 1:15)
or take a hundred ninety episode and (1:13 - 1:17)
that was like waiting for the one where (1:15 - 1:21)
I were i crack what I break I'm tired I (1:17 - 1:24)
think you just cracked and broke oh you (1:21 - 1:26)
certainly destroyed that church boy (1:24 - 1:31)
image will anderson also here who is bad (1:26 - 1:34)
well when did you start like episode 80 (1:31 - 1:38)
80 yeah right around there okay no here (1:34 - 1:41)
we all are wherever this is like the (1:38 - 1:43)
third week we've done live on McLaren (1:41 - 1:46)
Sunday um for some reason I feel like (1:43 - 1:48)
the last couple episodes have been (1:46 - 1:51)
strong that probably has to be in part (1:48 - 1:55)
that we we did like a three week stint (1:51 - 1:59)
of being live on twitch and I don't know (1:55 - 2:01)
I feel like that just kind of threw off (1:59 - 2:03)
our rhythm or something but i like i (2:01 - 2:05)
like just the recording and not seeing (2:03 - 2:09)
your guys's faces i agree if there's so (2:05 - 2:10)
anything I don't want to see it's (2:09 - 2:12)
stephen Travis yeah yeah you know we're (2:10 - 2:13)
mixing it up and we're doing we're only (2:12 - 2:15)
dude that makes their thing I mean you (2:13 - 2:16)
could say that the mix leurs thing could (2:15 - 2:19)
be as distracting as the twitch thing (2:16 - 2:21)
but not nearly as much because I don't (2:19 - 2:22)
have to worry about how my hair looks (2:21 - 2:24)
when we're doing it on Mike slur that's (2:22 - 2:26)
true also like mixer costs money and (2:24 - 2:28)
twitch doesnt so I want to make sure (2:26 - 2:30)
we're at least getting something out of (2:28 - 2:33)
mix l'heure speaking of a mix ler (2:30 - 2:35)
I've been listening to a lot of old it's (2:33 - 2:37)
super effective because that's the (2:35 - 2:39)
primary use if if you if you don't know (2:37 - 2:40)
what to listen to if you're just bored (2:39 - 2:43)
if you're maybe new or do it's super (2:40 - 2:44)
effective and you're like I don't know (2:43 - 2:46)
what to I don't know where to start with (2:44 - 2:48)
the older stuff you just turn on the (2:46 - 2:50)
mixer and something's going to be (2:48 - 2:51)
playing and I have to say after (2:50 - 2:55)
listening to some mixer stuff I it was (2:51 - 2:58)
like the 160 to 180 episode range I (2:55 - 3:00)
always sound like I'm tired like there's (2:58 - 3:04)
no oomph behind my voice and like oh (3:00 - 3:08)
that that doesn't sound like good kuka (3:04 - 3:13)
was an observation I observe what era of (3:08 - 3:15)
episodes was there what was six sixty to (3:13 - 3:17)
eighty that was that was after our (3:15 - 3:19)
hiatus that was what we came back from (3:17 - 3:23)
our Kickstarter we had a hiatus yeah he (3:19 - 3:27)
had a hiatus no yeah we did it was a (3:23 - 3:30)
hundred and fifty is when we had Joe (3:27 - 3:34)
from Sarah beyond yeah and then wasn't (3:30 - 3:37)
there for that one by remember that you (3:34 - 3:39)
know you know you sometimes you have to (3:37 - 3:44)
cut the fat when you're well given that (3:39 - 3:46)
terrible thing I said just like 10 (3:44 - 3:48)
minutes ago I would probably end up (3:46 - 3:51)
saying that to the webmaster of therapy (3:48 - 3:55)
and then we took was that I was probably (3:51 - 3:57)
in like august or something and then we (3:55 - 3:59)
the Kickstarter went live i think in (3:57 - 4:00)
September and then we didn't come back (3:59 - 4:03)
until like novemberish I want to say hmm (4:00 - 4:06)
i don't think it was that long i thought (4:03 - 4:08)
i was just like a month i think it was (4:06 - 4:10)
two months I just remember I could take (4:08 - 4:12)
like those really nice Sunday afternoon (4:10 - 4:15)
naps and not have to set an alarm to (4:12 - 4:19)
wake up in time to court I could just (4:15 - 4:22)
sleep and sleep and recover from my (4:19 - 4:26)
adorable so hard to be up at one p.m. on (4:22 - 4:29)
a sunday dude you don't even know I you (4:26 - 4:31)
know I ran over seven miles today in (4:29 - 4:35)
90-degree heat so I need a little bit of (4:31 - 4:37)
slack better than I did which was (4:35 - 4:39)
nothing yeah but you it's not like (4:37 - 4:41)
anyone's forcing you to run you're doing (4:39 - 4:45)
that of your free will the Marines are (4:41 - 4:47)
forcing me to because all our (4:45 - 4:48)
tober 30th these are going to hold me to (4:47 - 4:52)
task what on earth could you possibly be (4:48 - 4:54)
talking about the marine corps marathon (4:52 - 4:58)
right yeah but you don't like have to do (4:54 - 5:00)
that oh dude i paid like a hundred and (4:58 - 5:01)
forty dollars to be in that race that's (5:00 - 5:03)
no refunds that's the bribe you must do (5:01 - 5:05)
it this is the problem with races is you (5:03 - 5:08)
have to pay to do them so like once you (5:05 - 5:10)
pay you don't get that money back and (5:08 - 5:14)
it's either I run and make get my money (5:10 - 5:17)
money's worth or I don't run and that (5:14 - 5:19)
money is now down the drain but you know (5:17 - 5:20)
what those medals that they give out for (5:19 - 5:22)
the marine corps marathon are sweet oh (5:20 - 5:24)
there's some of the nicest metals you (5:22 - 5:26)
can get do you have to come in like top (5:24 - 5:28)
100 to get a medal or Oh everybody gets (5:26 - 5:31)
a medal okay cuz I did the color run and (5:28 - 5:33)
the only thing i got was like blue hair (5:31 - 5:35)
dye in my hair yeah but that's only like (5:33 - 5:38)
three miles right yes it was yeah okay I (5:35 - 5:41)
think yeah that's 3.1 or something I've (5:38 - 5:44)
never done a 5k well I think you'd be (5:41 - 5:47)
able to do a 5k pretty easily I mean I'm (5:44 - 5:50)
imagine since i did over two of them (5:47 - 5:54)
this dress is important yeah um i don't (5:50 - 5:56)
i don't i'm not a fast runner i'm more (5:54 - 5:59)
of a tank than a dps when it comes to (5:56 - 6:01)
running okay I understand so I'm slow (5:59 - 6:03)
and continuous and I like just hold out (6:01 - 6:06)
to the end as opposed to somebody who (6:03 - 6:08)
does a lot of damage right up front but (6:06 - 6:10)
you know if it you're in for the long (6:08 - 6:12)
haul they don't they don't last so more (6:10 - 6:14)
of a road hog and then a tracer now a (6:12 - 6:17)
tank I'm more of a more of a healer when (6:14 - 6:18)
I run I like to stay in the back and (6:17 - 6:21)
drink as much water as possible you (6:18 - 6:23)
you're the dude at the at the (6:21 - 6:24)
refreshment stand handing out the (6:23 - 6:26)
glasses of gatorade right right when i (6:24 - 6:28)
did the Color Run which was several (6:26 - 6:32)
years ago there was only two water (6:28 - 6:34)
stands and I was this Owen wonderful (6:32 - 6:36)
place support it happens every game why (6:34 - 6:38)
would why would you have a water stand (6:36 - 6:42)
at all and I use when you're runnin (6:38 - 6:44)
drinking I didn't drink any water at all (6:42 - 6:46)
this morning did not take any water with (6:44 - 6:47)
me is that isn't that that sounds bad (6:46 - 6:50)
yeah like the opposite of what you (6:47 - 6:52)
should do you have to weigh the balance (6:50 - 6:55)
so for me if it's under 10 miles I don't (6:52 - 6:57)
want to have to carry the weight of (6:55 - 6:58)
water because (6:57 - 7:00)
you have to carry that with you the (6:58 - 7:03)
entire time once I hit over 10 miles (7:00 - 7:05)
then I will take water with me but under (7:03 - 7:07)
10 miles I don't want to have to have (7:05 - 7:09)
that extra weight that's why you need to (7:07 - 7:11)
have like the kiosk set up so you can (7:09 - 7:13)
stop grab the cup of water drink and (7:11 - 7:16)
keep going well unfortunately there's no (7:13 - 7:19)
charitable kiosks hanging out there (7:16 - 7:21)
should be we should start a Kickstarter (7:19 - 7:25)
for just realer kiosks populated popular (7:21 - 7:28)
trails running routes yeah we're kiosks (7:25 - 7:30)
are set up well yeah I wasn't even doing (7:28 - 7:32)
for most of my run today I wasn't even (7:30 - 7:35)
doing a trail I was going down lo borro (7:32 - 7:38)
which is around by the Mexican (7:35 - 7:40)
ambassador's residence and the and the (7:38 - 7:43)
reservoir so that wasn't yeah I wouldn't (7:40 - 7:46)
have come across a kiosk anyways well I (7:43 - 7:48)
hope we know we'll still running sounds (7:46 - 7:49)
like Travis is still playing overwatch (7:48 - 7:55)
uh yeah yeah all right seriously I'm not (7:49 - 7:57)
getting any better is there a lady (7:55 - 7:59)
character that eats a lot of Doritos in (7:57 - 8:02)
that game with headphones on kind of yes (7:59 - 8:05)
and no there is a character in that game (8:02 - 8:09)
who's a the full Baberaham yeah that the (8:05 - 8:10)
character is supposed to be a (8:09 - 8:15)
professional gamer and she like operates (8:10 - 8:18)
a Mac in the game and so because she's a (8:15 - 8:21)
pro gamer the fan base in their artwork (8:18 - 8:23)
of her often depict her guzzling (8:21 - 8:25)
Mountain Dew and eating a lot of Doritos (8:23 - 8:27)
so yes and no there is that character (8:25 - 8:30)
but it's really stereotypical but it's (8:27 - 8:33)
also kind of funny don't buy that game (8:30 - 8:35)
Steve I've played enough of that game (8:33 - 8:38)
did you read box it no I I was in the (8:35 - 8:40)
beta I was in the early beta before they (8:38 - 8:42)
gave beta access to everyone so I (8:40 - 8:46)
probably put about 20 hours in Oh (8:42 - 8:49)
intriguing and the betas it was the full (8:46 - 8:50)
game there they didn't change anything (8:49 - 8:52)
when they release the game presides like (8:50 - 8:55)
reset your stats how'd you get in on (8:52 - 8:57)
that you just pre-ordered it on amazon (8:55 - 8:59)
and then they they gave it to you i (8:57 - 9:01)
think on like monday and then they gave (8:59 - 9:03)
everyone else access on thursday and (9:01 - 9:04)
then they extended it like an extra (9:03 - 9:07)
couple days so i play the entire time (9:04 - 9:11)
paid so high you you got it you (9:07 - 9:12)
pre-ordered on amazon you played the (9:11 - 9:14)
beta uh-huh and then you said this game (9:12 - 9:16)
is not for me and you cancelled your (9:14 - 9:19)
order you're a hundred percent right wow (9:16 - 9:23)
it's almost like stealing if the game (9:19 - 9:25)
would be for me if it was twenty bucks (9:23 - 9:28)
but it's sixty dollars on ps4 and (9:25 - 9:30)
there's just not enough content there's (9:28 - 9:33)
not enough game there yeah even though I (9:30 - 9:38)
like it a lot i've put about 30 ish (9:33 - 9:42)
hours 30 35 hours into it and everyone (9:38 - 9:43)
has said this and has already said it (9:42 - 9:45)
more eloquently than I have but even on (9:43 - 9:48)
PC $40 seems like a strange price to pay (9:45 - 9:52)
for a game with two game modes for just (9:48 - 9:55)
play the game or play the game with (9:52 - 9:58)
little wacky rules thoroughness I think (9:55 - 10:01)
more zone control like those are your (9:58 - 10:04)
only two modes they do every week they (10:01 - 10:07)
hadn't they they don't add they rotate (10:04 - 10:09)
out different game modes like the one (10:07 - 10:10)
that was I don't remember what the one (10:09 - 10:13)
is like right now with the one last week (10:10 - 10:15)
was mystery hero so every time you died (10:13 - 10:18)
it would resurrect you as a different (10:15 - 10:19)
here you hero that you couldn't switch (10:18 - 10:21)
out up so they have like little they (10:19 - 10:22)
call them brawls similar to how (10:21 - 10:25)
hearthstone has the tavern brawl that's (10:22 - 10:26)
what out every week but but just like (10:25 - 10:28)
that and then the normal quick play (10:26 - 10:32)
seems like a little sparse it doesn't (10:28 - 10:34)
really matter to me just because I find (10:32 - 10:39)
it to be a good game to play after a day (10:34 - 10:41)
of doing whatever it's a good game don't (10:39 - 10:43)
wind down for me so I don't really care (10:41 - 10:46)
but if I were not already inclined (10:43 - 10:47)
towards that type of game I would be a (10:46 - 10:50)
little weirded out by the price tag (10:47 - 10:52)
especially on consoles well somebody (10:50 - 10:54)
should do like a research project (10:52 - 10:56)
because I think you can pretty easily (10:54 - 11:00)
say nowadays that if something is a (10:56 - 11:01)
triple a game it's going to be sixty (11:00 - 11:03)
dollars period right triple-a has to be (11:01 - 11:05)
sixty dollars even if it's going to come (11:03 - 11:07)
with expansions later those expansions (11:05 - 11:08)
cost more money but it didn't always (11:07 - 11:11)
used to be that way like games were (11:08 - 11:13)
really priced more towards like what the (11:11 - 11:15)
projected demand was going to be and (11:13 - 11:17)
there was a lot of variation in the (11:15 - 11:19)
pricing of games but now it's like it (11:17 - 11:20)
doesn't matter if you're a five-hour (11:19 - 11:22)
game or a hundred our game if you're a (11:20 - 11:24)
triple a game then you're sixty dollars (11:22 - 11:26)
so somebody figure out what (11:24 - 11:28)
day and date that occurred and what was (11:26 - 11:31)
the what is it it was the release of the (11:28 - 11:34)
eyetoy for the playstation 2 everything (11:31 - 11:36)
just went downhill from there I mean I'm (11:34 - 11:38)
I don't really care how much a game (11:36 - 11:42)
pause / content there and that sounds (11:38 - 11:44)
hypocritical from what I just said (11:42 - 11:46)
earlier but like I played paid twenty (11:44 - 11:48)
dollars for fire watch and fire watch a (11:46 - 11:51)
very short experience and not much (11:48 - 11:54)
changes in it and then you know I (11:51 - 11:57)
complained because overwatch was sixty (11:54 - 11:58)
dollars and the only difference between (11:57 - 12:02)
the sixty dollars on ps4 and the forty (11:58 - 12:06)
dollars on PC was there was a think six (12:02 - 12:09)
or eight exclusive skins and tomorrow at (12:06 - 12:11)
tornado alley yeah that's that's not (12:09 - 12:14)
worth like give me the forty dollar (12:11 - 12:15)
option on ps4 I probably but it would (12:14 - 12:18)
have been more likely to buy it also as (12:15 - 12:22)
will elegantly put it earlier in episode (12:18 - 12:25)
I am a game gobbler i gobbled my 20 to (12:22 - 12:28)
25 hours in the beta knowing that if i (12:25 - 12:31)
paid forty more or 60 more dollars i (12:28 - 12:33)
would get exactly what I just consumed (12:31 - 12:36)
and I felt good at like I felt was like (12:33 - 12:39)
I got what I wanted to in the beta like (12:36 - 12:42)
yes I could continue paying I could (12:39 - 12:45)
continue to play this but i don't want (12:42 - 12:47)
to pay that much money to continue to (12:45 - 12:48)
play this like if it was in front of me (12:47 - 12:50)
yeah I'd play it I'd have fun it's the (12:48 - 12:52)
shooter great cool but like I have other (12:50 - 12:56)
stuff to play and i am one that i (12:52 - 13:00)
appreciate the the search like the grind (12:56 - 13:03)
the I want that carrot on a stick and (13:00 - 13:05)
there's none of that in overwatch you (13:03 - 13:07)
don't get you don't get that rush when (13:05 - 13:10)
you get a loop box and level up in here (13:07 - 13:13)
I don't like the costumes are cool but (13:10 - 13:16)
they don't do it like it's not the same (13:13 - 13:20)
as a new gun destiny where the perks are (13:16 - 13:22)
different and it's like I have four auto (13:20 - 13:24)
rifles but this auto rifle has this perk (13:22 - 13:26)
which may or may not be better but it's (13:24 - 13:29)
still something that I could shuffle (13:26 - 13:31)
through no idea what yeah and sarcastic (13:29 - 13:34)
but i mean like steve is a sucker for (13:31 - 13:37)
like they just pours his money into the (13:34 - 13:39)
most ridiculous things because (13:37 - 13:41)
right Travis you don't pay attention to (13:39 - 13:42)
destiny so you don't know this but (13:41 - 13:45)
they've announced like they're returning (13:42 - 13:48)
one of the most popular rocket launchers (13:45 - 13:50)
to destiny gallop horn um but like if (13:48 - 13:53)
you have a pre-order or something (13:50 - 13:55)
special it's like you can get the black (13:53 - 13:57)
gala Warren ok everybody else can't and (13:55 - 13:59)
steve is like I've already written my (13:57 - 14:01)
check cuz I've got to have the black oh (13:59 - 14:04)
it's packaged I've already it's pretty (14:01 - 14:05)
ordered Steve I was actually looking at (14:04 - 14:08)
destiny on the Xbox one just the other (14:05 - 14:12)
day and guess how much all current (14:08 - 14:14)
destiny content everything even with the (14:12 - 14:16)
special pre-order upgrades and (14:14 - 14:17)
everything I think it's our sale this (14:16 - 14:19)
week because of their announcement it's (14:17 - 14:21)
like a thirty dollars for everything at (14:19 - 14:22)
thirty dollars for everything and then (14:21 - 14:25)
how much for all the add-ons the special (14:22 - 14:28)
class items and set etc oh I don't know (14:25 - 14:30)
those are probably another like 20-40 so (14:28 - 14:33)
it comes to 40 for everything yeah and (14:30 - 14:35)
how much did you pay to get everything (14:33 - 14:39)
Oh easily you know a hundred I probably (14:35 - 14:41)
put like five hundred dollars into (14:39 - 14:45)
destiny because of Albany all the dances (14:41 - 14:48)
um yeah I mean I've put a ton of money (14:45 - 14:51)
into destiny because I you know got the (14:48 - 14:54)
ps4 for it and the Vita for it but I've (14:51 - 14:57)
also I've also approached 1600 hours (14:54 - 15:00)
into destiny so the dollar to our ratio (14:57 - 15:05)
i think is is was worth my wild there (15:00 - 15:07)
are other games with dollar to our (15:05 - 15:10)
wishing if you're if it really is five (15:07 - 15:12)
hundred dollars that you spent in 1600 (15:10 - 15:13)
hours they put in that's still three (15:12 - 15:16)
dollars 3.2 dollars an hour which that's (15:13 - 15:22)
an expensive arcade cabinet Wow but the (15:16 - 15:26)
memories Travis the the mem (15:22 - 15:32)
Pokemon is a thing how much of that how (15:26 - 15:34)
much her there how much of that bring (15:32 - 15:36)
these conversations just gonna get cut I (15:34 - 15:39)
thought it was good spending like 40 (15:36 - 15:40)
minutes talking about how much money we (15:39 - 15:42)
spend on video game it was about 15 (15:40 - 15:43)
minutes I was looking at the timer (15:42 - 15:46)
because we had three minutes of you slip (15:43 - 15:50)
it up before we went into sound right (15:46 - 15:52)
three minutes of dreams a bell hottie (15:50 - 15:54)
mouse there's only like there's only (15:52 - 15:57)
like 15 of our 15 listeners that heard (15:54 - 15:59)
it and we have quite a bit of listeners (15:57 - 16:03)
so that's a very small very small market (15:59 - 16:05)
alright let's start off with some (16:03 - 16:08)
pokemon news we will start off with the (16:05 - 16:12)
zorro of pork pokemon zygarde wait now (16:08 - 16:15)
is our darkest deserve Pokemon does (16:12 - 16:18)
Zorich drawers ease on things when it (16:15 - 16:22)
shoots off its it does I don't think it (16:18 - 16:24)
does with one move you just don't know (16:22 - 16:27)
Zoroark as well as I do now zygarde is (16:24 - 16:30)
the Zorro the mast I don't even know (16:27 - 16:33)
what Zorro's catchphrases the masked (16:30 - 16:40)
Avenger he says hey I've got a sword hey (16:33 - 16:43)
guess what you're gonna get cut up there (16:40 - 16:47)
uh there was a YouTube was at the (16:43 - 16:50)
YouTube video it was a premiered at the (16:47 - 16:53)
Taiwan national championships which they (16:50 - 16:55)
had that's what I was confused were they (16:53 - 16:57)
Ansel no that was the giant that was the (16:55 - 17:02)
Hong Kong video footage of zygarde ten (16:57 - 17:04)
percent form and zygarde complete form (17:02 - 17:05)
in Pokemon Sun and Moon has been (17:04 - 17:07)
revealed originally aired at the 2016 (17:05 - 17:10)
Taiwan Pokemon video game national (17:07 - 17:12)
championships which has been uploaded (17:10 - 17:16)
the official Japanese youtube channel (17:12 - 17:17)
Pokemon youtube channel the official (17:16 - 17:20)
japanese youtube channel all I think (17:17 - 17:22)
it's on the English Channel now too okay (17:20 - 17:24)
zygarde ten percent form was shown using (17:22 - 17:28)
moves thousand waves and thousand arrows (17:24 - 17:30)
these moves exist in the code in (17:28 - 17:33)
generation six but they are currently (17:30 - 17:37)
unobtainable when at low HP zygarde ten (17:33 - 17:38)
percent form (17:37 - 17:40)
which one is tempers is that the dog the (17:38 - 17:44)
doggy okay ten percent form ability (17:40 - 17:48)
swarm chain when at low HP zygarde ten (17:44 - 17:50)
percent forms ability swarm change (17:48 - 17:52)
activates changing it into complete form (17:50 - 17:56)
and restoring HP zygarde complete form (17:52 - 17:59)
was shown using a new move called core (17:56 - 18:02)
enforcer this move has a long animation (17:59 - 18:04)
which like our raises into the air (18:02 - 18:06)
prepares energy orbs at his chest and (18:04 - 18:08)
then shoots down Abby and draws AZ shape (18:06 - 18:11)
on top of the target which then burst (18:08 - 18:13)
into fire while the type has not been (18:11 - 18:16)
revealed it was a super effective damage (18:13 - 18:20)
to a Garchomp oh so it's obviously ice (18:16 - 18:24)
haha bar is flying good against ground (18:20 - 18:28)
no it'd be there ice or dragon it's it's (18:24 - 18:31)
probably a dragon-type move honestly (18:28 - 18:33)
probably yeah where or if we're doing (18:31 - 18:36)
really it could be one of the I mean (18:33 - 18:39)
we've seen with jen 6 we saw moves like (18:36 - 18:42)
freeze dry and flying press that are a (18:39 - 18:46)
bit of a strange take on how super (18:42 - 18:49)
effective works or even how move typing (18:46 - 18:51)
work so could even be something like (18:49 - 18:55)
that is ten percent form the the one (18:51 - 18:56)
that stayed or that ten percent complete (18:55 - 19:00)
form that's like the robot one yeah got (18:56 - 19:02)
it we'd like the snake head as its chest (19:00 - 19:06)
yep yeah fifty fifty percent is the one (19:02 - 19:09)
that we know and love from x and y oh (19:06 - 19:12)
yeah it's like a salamander when with a (19:09 - 19:17)
strange pad dress um ten percent cobra (19:12 - 19:21)
the are baka my toes I was gonna yeah (19:17 - 19:24)
you're right I can I'll just leave that (19:21 - 19:28)
is now be ten percent of the dog cell (19:24 - 19:32)
there is like a little yeah and there's (19:28 - 19:34)
core zygarde which is like another (19:32 - 19:36)
amoeba like an one and then complete is (19:34 - 19:39)
the Robo guys not actually a robot but (19:36 - 19:44)
it is it a Vox it evokes like Max yeah (19:39 - 19:46)
and if anybody hasn't watched the (19:44 - 19:48)
footage from the Taiwan national (19:46 - 19:50)
championships i recommend it just (19:48 - 19:52)
because it's obviously the first (19:50 - 19:54)
reveal of that ability that converts ten (19:52 - 19:58)
percent warm into complete form and the (19:54 - 20:01)
hype in that room was so real there's (19:58 - 20:04)
someone young like no no no no the whole (20:01 - 20:06)
the whole broom like you so you can hear (20:04 - 20:08)
like hundreds of people who are like (20:06 - 20:10)
shocked that this is happening in front (20:08 - 20:13)
of it it's amazing it's like infectious (20:10 - 20:15)
tubes and you get all hype for like (20:13 - 20:17)
super zygarde and then you start you (20:15 - 20:19)
shed a little tear because i guard never (20:17 - 20:22)
got got his game well we only really (20:19 - 20:23)
have these two articles the zygarde one (20:22 - 20:25)
in the one I'm about to talk about so (20:23 - 20:27)
light on news except the two news (20:25 - 20:29)
articles we have our kind of important (20:27 - 20:32)
things i guard still important tiger (20:29 - 20:34)
it's still relevant still relevant yeah (20:32 - 20:38)
there will be after we finish this (20:34 - 20:40)
podcast III will be starting i believe (20:38 - 20:42)
it starts at three p.m. central time and (20:40 - 20:46)
I opens up with EA and then I think (20:42 - 20:47)
ubisoft is later tonight and then (20:46 - 20:50)
tomorrow of course it being Microsoft (20:47 - 20:54)
Tony and then on Tuesday Nintendo yeah (20:50 - 20:55)
and tender will have their treehouse of (20:54 - 20:58)
horror yep so we'll probably get more (20:55 - 21:02)
Pokemon news i am i confident we'll get (20:58 - 21:05)
a new trailer for sun and moon i'm also (21:02 - 21:07)
I'm also confident that they're gonna (21:05 - 21:10)
say Pokemon go beta for everyone (21:07 - 21:13)
starting like this week I feel like (21:10 - 21:15)
they're gonna do that especially was a (21:13 - 21:16)
chance that they don't even mention (21:15 - 21:18)
Pokemon go because they don't want to (21:16 - 21:20)
confuse people you get people confused (21:18 - 21:22)
between Sun and Moon and Pokemon go (21:20 - 21:25)
maybe but like Pokemon go has to come (21:22 - 21:27)
out before sun and moon right like that (21:25 - 21:29)
yet that is the that is the hype train (21:27 - 21:33)
for the summer leading people to go like (21:29 - 21:35)
oh yeah pokemons cool again let's get (21:33 - 21:40)
under 3ds and also who got invited to (21:35 - 21:42)
this beta it wasn't me well Travis (21:40 - 21:45)
wasn't will well I don't have any phone (21:42 - 21:48)
that can play that game so I feel like (21:45 - 21:51)
no one got invited clearly people got (21:48 - 21:54)
invited a lot of people i knows friends (21:51 - 21:57)
got invited to it yeah the way I heard (21:54 - 22:00)
it I got a friend who got invited but I (21:57 - 22:05)
didn't yeah i was talking to Ellen from (22:00 - 22:06)
my other podcast i do the tuesday (22:05 - 22:08)
my podcast and he was like how's the (22:06 - 22:09)
Pokemon go beta and I was like I didn't (22:08 - 22:11)
I didn't get in he's look what do you (22:09 - 22:12)
mean you didn't get in and I was like I (22:11 - 22:14)
signed up like everyone else and I (22:12 - 22:17)
didn't get in and he's like oh my my (22:14 - 22:18)
friend so-and-so got in and I was like (22:17 - 22:21)
that's all I ever hear is my friend got (22:18 - 22:23)
in i think a lot of people are claiming (22:21 - 22:27)
they got in but it's not true yeah I (22:23 - 22:30)
mean it's at the end of the world I just (22:27 - 22:32)
think it's ed I just think it's funny (22:30 - 22:34)
because there were a lot of people very (22:32 - 22:36)
excited to get in and the the ratio to (22:34 - 22:39)
people who got into people who wanted to (22:36 - 22:42)
get in is very off that's how bad is (22:39 - 22:44)
work oh yeah unless you're over watch (22:42 - 22:47)
then you pay up front for the beta and (22:44 - 22:49)
then you can select you get um alright (22:47 - 22:53)
the big news here Cora Cora it's this (22:49 - 22:56)
little magazine in Japan I love I'm sure (22:53 - 23:00)
that coro coro has a purpose other than (22:56 - 23:03)
show a showing Pokemon things when a new (23:00 - 23:06)
game is coming out but it's weird that (23:03 - 23:09)
in the unless unless it does reveals for (23:06 - 23:10)
other games that I don't know about it's (23:09 - 23:12)
weird to me that in the West it's only (23:10 - 23:13)
known as that magazine that will (23:12 - 23:15)
occasionally show Pokemon things because (23:13 - 23:18)
I don't even know what that magazine is (23:15 - 23:20)
about is it a visit a video game (23:18 - 23:22)
magazine or is it just a magazine about (23:20 - 23:23)
something else that occasionally talks (23:22 - 23:26)
about pokemon pokemon I think it's one (23:23 - 23:28)
of those like it's kind of like um I'm (23:26 - 23:30)
probably gonna say this the wrong way (23:28 - 23:33)
they put magazine Nickelodeon money baby (23:30 - 23:36)
I was gonna say like teen beat or Tiger (23:33 - 23:39)
Beat where it's like some of it is fan (23:36 - 23:41)
service for video games not that kind of (23:39 - 23:43)
a beat it's more like a news reporters (23:41 - 23:48)
beat sir and reportedly met the have (23:43 - 23:51)
like manga you think you're funny Oh (23:48 - 23:55)
were hilarious the thing I know they'll (23:51 - 23:57)
have like some manga episodes because (23:55 - 23:59)
you know a lot of manga is delivered (23:57 - 24:01)
episodic Lee and then like shonen jump (23:59 - 24:04)
right that has like mango snippets so I (24:01 - 24:06)
think it's that kind of a thing because (24:04 - 24:08)
like you know I cuz I'm I'm also (24:06 - 24:10)
familiar with Cairo Cairo a switch does (24:08 - 24:12)
a lot of the reveals of the Buescher (24:10 - 24:15)
road and the bushy road cardfight (24:12 - 24:18)
vanguard I know the mangas sewed say it (24:15 - 24:20)
again is that the sequel (24:18 - 24:23)
aussie road now Crossy Road so good no (24:20 - 24:28)
stop this is Pokemon time um did you (24:23 - 24:30)
know did you know that boo she wrote (24:28 - 24:32)
Owens new japan pro wrestling that I (24:30 - 24:34)
didn't know what I my vote was they (24:32 - 24:36)
barely know and a guard I only know (24:34 - 24:38)
bushy road because of gencon well they (24:36 - 24:41)
own new japan pro wrestling anyways back (24:38 - 24:43)
to magazines I think there are several (24:41 - 24:45)
magazines in Japan that are kind of like (24:43 - 24:48)
corporate mouthpieces or have exclusive (24:45 - 24:49)
contracts to reveal information for (24:48 - 24:52)
various corporate entities ok alright in (24:49 - 24:54)
this manner yet I have two thoughts on (24:52 - 24:59)
Cora Cora one is we only see two to four (24:54 - 25:02)
pages of Cora Cora every month i wiii am (24:59 - 25:04)
very curious what the rest of that (25:02 - 25:06)
magazine looks like maybe even like the (25:04 - 25:08)
cover of it i have no clue what is there (25:06 - 25:10)
look I have somebody in Japan says mail (25:08 - 25:13)
you a copy yeah I should I should ask I (25:10 - 25:18)
should ask Andrew to this point to is (25:13 - 25:22)
the initial person only one person in (25:18 - 25:25)
Japan has a daisy camera on their cell (25:22 - 25:28)
phone and they kind of take bad pictures (25:25 - 25:32)
every month I don't know who you know (25:28 - 25:34)
corocoro photographer is that sends (25:32 - 25:37)
these over to bulbapedia and savvy and (25:34 - 25:39)
you know all these other internet (25:37 - 25:44)
outlets yourself a DSLR dude but wyd why (25:39 - 25:45)
does it why is it only one picture why (25:44 - 25:48)
do we only have one picture of the page (25:45 - 25:50)
why is this person not taking two or (25:48 - 25:52)
three pictures get us some different (25:50 - 25:54)
angles get us some good lighting maybe (25:52 - 25:55)
outside by the pond and maybe maybe (25:54 - 25:58)
invest in a scanner yeah I just I don't (25:55 - 26:02)
understand what's going on here what why (25:58 - 26:05)
are we living in this year two thousand (26:02 - 26:08)
of taking pictures of magazines I don't (26:05 - 26:11)
understand I just don't get it it's the (26:08 - 26:12)
it's the modern equivalent to the (26:11 - 26:15)
camcorder let's play it just like (26:12 - 26:17)
reminds me of like somebody's sitting in (26:15 - 26:19)
a movie theater with a camcorder just (26:17 - 26:21)
recording the movie like they're all (26:19 - 26:24)
digital now just no s the guy who's (26:21 - 26:26)
making 750 an hour if you can get the (26:24 - 26:29)
flash drive oh now dude the projector (26:26 - 26:31)
people's union the union of (26:29 - 26:34)
projectionists ah they make a (26:31 - 26:37)
money not the big I'm not not you know (26:34 - 26:40)
sixteen-year-old 750 and our guy that's (26:37 - 26:43)
flip and turn on when that dude is not (26:40 - 26:45)
running the projector I guarantee it all (26:43 - 26:48)
right trust me I find yourself somebody (26:45 - 26:49)
who runs a projector for movie theaters (26:48 - 26:52)
you'll find out what a scam that is yeah (26:49 - 26:53)
rejection let's make more money than (26:52 - 26:55)
like the person cleaning popcorn or (26:53 - 26:57)
whatever okay learning something new (26:55 - 26:59)
here all right more importantly back to (26:57 - 27:01)
coro coro if we were planning about this (26:59 - 27:03)
for a reason this month's Cora Cora (27:01 - 27:06)
really filled two new pokemon these I (27:03 - 27:08)
these have to be Japanese names these (27:06 - 27:10)
cannot be the English names because (27:08 - 27:13)
they're not punny enough to the animals (27:10 - 27:15)
they represent the first one is Nick (27:13 - 27:20)
Aurora and I winco I nwankwo doesn't it (27:15 - 27:23)
doesn't even matter how they're gonna (27:20 - 27:27)
change neca wallah there's no L in neck (27:23 - 27:30)
Aurora I saw an L in there oh it's any (27:27 - 27:35)
kk o AR a oh well I think because in in (27:30 - 27:37)
Japanese they don't have the L sound so (27:35 - 27:39)
there's no distinction between the r and (27:37 - 27:42)
Elsa yeah I see alright so air so it (27:39 - 27:44)
would almost like that cuz isn't it more (27:42 - 27:48)
of like a oh the strip is the r / l (27:44 - 27:50)
sounded like the strange love child of (27:48 - 27:54)
our L&D so it'd be like Nicole Audra so (27:50 - 27:55)
probably something along those lines (27:54 - 27:58)
very similar to the to the short are in (27:55 - 28:01)
portuguese i met i think all right we (27:58 - 28:05)
broke Steve yeah and then the other (28:01 - 28:07)
one's a dog cool yeah i'll forget a (28:05 - 28:09)
koala one is the good one I've already (28:07 - 28:11)
forgotten these names I will I can't (28:09 - 28:13)
even remember what the starters names in (28:11 - 28:16)
Japan were that art is now popular (28:13 - 28:18)
Lytton and rowlett I don't even know (28:16 - 28:20)
what the original deppen oh yeah those (28:18 - 28:22)
were like really long and difficult to (28:20 - 28:25)
understand so the DA let's start with (28:22 - 28:26)
the DA the quote let's start with the (28:25 - 28:29)
Koala the good one the good one the (28:26 - 28:32)
koala is a normal type of Pokemon it has (28:29 - 28:35)
the ability sure sleeper too cool (28:32 - 28:39)
ability the new one Travis will explain (28:35 - 28:41)
what it does in a second here nah it is (28:39 - 28:45)
known for dreaming it is known as The (28:41 - 28:47)
Dreaming Pokemon it appears to be based (28:45 - 28:48)
on the koala (28:47 - 28:51)
it's one foot eight inches American (28:48 - 28:54)
height it weighs 20 American pounds it's (28:51 - 28:56)
oh and Travis will let you know what the (28:54 - 28:59)
ability yeah if i remember right I'll (28:56 - 29:01)
look it up and correct myself later if (28:59 - 29:02)
i'm wrong but if I remember it correctly (29:01 - 29:06)
the only status effect that can affect (29:02 - 29:09)
it is sleep so it's immune to poison (29:06 - 29:13)
paralysis burn freeze it's it's just (29:09 - 29:17)
it's so sleepy guy and I thought that (29:13 - 29:19)
it's like it was considered to be (29:17 - 29:23)
perpetually asleep so actually even the (29:19 - 29:25)
sleep status concession wouldn't affect (29:23 - 29:27)
it because it's considered to already be (29:25 - 29:29)
asleep no I think I sins go to sleep (29:27 - 29:31)
yeah I can go to sleep it just can't be (29:29 - 29:33)
paralyzed or poisoned or yeah the (29:31 - 29:36)
ability sure sleeper prevents it from (29:33 - 29:38)
being afflicted by status conditions (29:36 - 29:43)
other than sleep haha yep and then the (29:38 - 29:47)
dog is a rock-type pokemon this is the (29:43 - 29:50)
little dog that we saw in the second (29:47 - 29:53)
trailer of Sun and Moon the one that was (29:50 - 29:55)
right outside the house when the trainer (29:53 - 29:57)
left the house mmm I don't know of a (29:55 - 29:59)
second trailer but yeah well it was a (29:57 - 30:02)
special coro coro tree I was a special (29:59 - 30:04)
cork or trailer wasn't like this second (30:02 - 30:07)
English paler it has the ability keen (30:04 - 30:10)
eye and vital spirit abilities keen eye (30:07 - 30:12)
and vital spirit it is known as the (30:10 - 30:13)
puppy Pokemon it appears to be based on (30:12 - 30:17)
a dog it is one foot four inches tall (30:13 - 30:20)
weighs 44 pounds the pokemon and (30:17 - 30:22)
previously yeah it appeared in the other (30:20 - 30:24)
trailer Kenai what is that you can't say (30:22 - 30:27)
an attack doesn't work yeah you your (30:24 - 30:31)
accuracy cannot be lowered and then (30:27 - 30:35)
vital spirit prevents um sleep inmate (30:31 - 30:37)
you can't fall asleep that's the (30:35 - 30:40)
opposite of shore sleep in a way yeah I (30:37 - 30:43)
I'm assuming these are your two Pokemon (30:40 - 30:46)
that appear early on I guess you have (30:43 - 30:49)
liked to that well then there they'll (30:46 - 30:52)
need to add in a bird but right yeah but (30:49 - 30:54)
yeah I mean when they showed fletching (30:52 - 30:56)
and whatever other Pokemon it was like (30:54 - 30:57)
those were the two you saw early on (30:56 - 31:01)
watch hog and what pat rad i should say (30:57 - 31:01)
and (31:01 - 31:06)
Trat lilla pop and who's the bird of (31:01 - 31:11)
pidove hey remember remember this old (31:06 - 31:13)
it's super effective mean a lollipop (31:11 - 31:20)
lollipop Ali I remember that sorry don't (31:13 - 31:23)
remember remember last week when I said (31:20 - 31:27)
I bet these new legendary pokémon will (31:23 - 31:30)
have alternative forms well so gay leo (31:27 - 31:33)
has a ton of form known as rising phase (31:30 - 31:36)
in which it is described being like the (31:33 - 31:43)
Sun in this phase and that is run here (31:36 - 31:45)
the bag that is the pokemon that's (31:43 - 31:47)
supposed to be the Sun is described as (31:45 - 31:50)
being like the Sun in a different form (31:47 - 31:54)
or the fact that a Pokemon that is that (31:50 - 31:56)
or the fact that like the Bulba news or (31:54 - 31:59)
whatever you're reading off of article (31:56 - 32:02)
described the new dog Pokemon which is (31:59 - 32:05)
listed as the puppy pokemon as being a (32:02 - 32:08)
dog like an appearance well because it's (32:05 - 32:10)
rock type so yeah it's cool that maybe (32:08 - 32:13)
it's like a bonsly or something I feel (32:10 - 32:17)
like this is bones Lee this this puppy (32:13 - 32:18)
is going to turn into like a diggersby (32:17 - 32:20)
of like whoa I didn't expect that did (32:18 - 32:23)
you just say what is it bones Lee yeah (32:20 - 32:27)
what is that it's the thing that's the (32:23 - 32:30)
pre evolution of sudowoodo but that's (32:27 - 32:34)
bonsly ice bonsly bonsly it's all the (32:30 - 32:38)
same Oh Lord it doesn't have an e it's (32:34 - 32:40)
not like it's not like a rejected (32:38 - 32:42)
undertale character how do you how do (32:40 - 32:47)
you say the name of the the band of the (32:42 - 32:49)
guy he's things by himself and he's from (32:47 - 32:52)
wisconsin and uses a french name for his (32:49 - 32:54)
band boney there yes that's because he's (32:52 - 32:56)
French you don't call it Bonnie but yep (32:54 - 32:58)
no he's not French he's American he's (32:56 - 33:02)
what whatever the name is French I don't (32:58 - 33:03)
know it's a good winner or whatever (33:02 - 33:05)
because apparently people like winter (33:03 - 33:07)
which is absurd it's the worst season (33:05 - 33:10)
agreed so gaily Oh have you know (33:07 - 33:12)
internalized therefore known as the (33:10 - 33:15)
rising phase I don't think that (33:12 - 33:17)
is an alternative form in this phase it (33:15 - 33:19)
appears more radiant and its color (33:17 - 33:22)
colored accents become more yellow so (33:19 - 33:24)
Gallio is seen in this phase during the (33:22 - 33:26)
animation for its signature move (33:24 - 33:28)
sunstrike this informations off (33:26 - 33:31)
bulbapedia bulbapedia by the way loon (33:28 - 33:34)
allah has a alternative form known as (33:31 - 33:36)
the full moon phase in which it said in (33:34 - 33:38)
which it said to Paul the moon in this (33:36 - 33:41)
phase its wings glow white highlighted (33:38 - 33:44)
with the skeletal structure loon Allah (33:41 - 33:46)
is seen in this phase during the (33:44 - 33:48)
animation for signature moon move moon (33:46 - 33:50)
guys to beam I don't think that's a (33:48 - 33:52)
form-change like we think of form-change (33:50 - 33:54)
where it actually changes the stats of (33:52 - 33:57)
the Pokemon I think it's just a cosmetic (33:54 - 33:59)
change to their parents as they're about (33:57 - 34:01)
to perform a certain attack or something (33:59 - 34:03)
you're probably right but like at this (34:01 - 34:06)
point with curium form and jamin form (34:03 - 34:09)
and which all changed the stats of (34:06 - 34:14)
Amelia genesect forms and Deena's form (34:09 - 34:17)
and beyond or their precedent for a (34:14 - 34:19)
Pokemon with a form-change that's purely (34:17 - 34:22)
cosmetic I don't think so ah I don't (34:19 - 34:25)
know I but out these things have to have (34:22 - 34:28)
alternative forms like what main series (34:25 - 34:30)
legendary Pokemon have we gotten that (34:28 - 34:33)
haven't gone down this road right but (34:30 - 34:37)
all of them zygarde xerneas like or just (34:33 - 34:41)
like 17 forms not yet xerneas and (34:37 - 34:45)
yveltal don't have alternate forms ah do (34:41 - 34:47)
they not they do not one looks like a (34:45 - 34:50)
shiny bacon though that's i'm so tired (34:47 - 34:52)
of your making fun of my bird of (34:50 - 34:55)
district destruction bacon of (34:52 - 34:58)
destruction mcgarin migire now that's a (34:55 - 35:00)
Pokemon that still exists here has a new (34:58 - 35:02)
ability called soul heart which can (35:00 - 35:04)
raise its special attacks that the (35:02 - 35:06)
trigger is not currently known it can (35:04 - 35:09)
learn a new move called flee or cannon (35:06 - 35:12)
floral blur blur or cannon there's (35:09 - 35:14)
somebody remember in my hair Harry (35:12 - 35:16)
Potter how there is the french girl (35:14 - 35:20)
fleur de liquor yeah yes clear and then (35:16 - 35:24)
finally a special pokemon gail a disc (35:20 - 35:27)
will include a QR code to obtain migire (35:24 - 35:29)
nuh in Pokemon Sun and Moon (35:27 - 35:31)
this migire now will be level 50 have (35:29 - 35:33)
the ability so heart know the moves (35:31 - 35:36)
fleer of floor canon flash cannon lucky (35:33 - 35:38)
chant and helping hand I'm gonna (35:36 - 35:41)
continue my trend in the last few (35:38 - 35:44)
episodes of interrupting you to correct (35:41 - 35:47)
a thing I said a little earlier keldeo (35:44 - 35:49)
is a pokemon that's two forms that are (35:47 - 35:51)
purely cosmetic in their differences (35:49 - 35:56)
wait Aleutian no resolution form changes (35:51 - 36:00)
the stats I don't believe it does Oh (35:56 - 36:02)
disturb let me get on the internet to (36:00 - 36:05)
dispute this yeah oh yeah like Landorus (36:02 - 36:09)
and them have different forms yeah but (36:05 - 36:10)
those are the first also have your stats (36:09 - 36:13)
I know I just like every legendary (36:10 - 36:16)
mythical Pokemon has a million forms (36:13 - 36:20)
it's fine it's whatever it's just it (36:16 - 36:21)
gets confusing at some point because (36:20 - 36:23)
those because these forms like they're (36:21 - 36:25)
day they don't follow a certain pattern (36:23 - 36:27)
right I don't think there's any (36:25 - 36:29)
difference between resolute form and (36:27 - 36:30)
whatever you would call the normal and (36:29 - 36:32)
what's the point of having resolute form (36:30 - 36:34)
because it's cool that if you get the (36:32 - 36:36)
right move on it it changes its (36:34 - 36:38)
appearance and it's a little yeah that's (36:36 - 36:40)
that's make restored it's like a little (36:38 - 36:42)
like ooh the big question here is what's (36:40 - 36:45)
the point does it change its ability (36:42 - 36:48)
nope I mean I could be wrong but I but I (36:45 - 36:50)
pretty sure if memory serves I haven't (36:48 - 36:53)
it's been a while since I've had any (36:50 - 36:55)
competitive team that had a Calvillo on (36:53 - 36:57)
it and a dozen as you if you're playing (36:55 - 36:59)
against a Cal do I don't remember having (36:57 - 37:02)
to remember any difference when if it is (36:59 - 37:06)
in resolute or the ordinary form when (37:02 - 37:09)
fighting against it so on the TCG Cal do (37:06 - 37:12)
can Russian yes I guess it's uh it's (37:09 - 37:16)
just uh it learns it gets the move (37:12 - 37:19)
secret sword it's just so whatever mmm (37:16 - 37:21)
yeah keldeo had like the worst pokemon (37:19 - 37:24)
movie of all so there you go that mean (37:21 - 37:26)
it makes sense it makes sense you know (37:24 - 37:28)
what else makes sense that we're done (37:26 - 37:30)
with news and we should take break when (37:28 - 37:33)
we come back we have I got three emails (37:30 - 37:37)

from Chris see hi spj will Travis and (38:56 - 39:01)
anyone else that could be on at this (38:59 - 39:04)
moment I'm a young listener as in the (39:01 - 39:05)
seventh grade I listen to your show as (39:04 - 39:07)
often as I can I have been interested in (39:05 - 39:09)
Pokemon since I was two when I first saw (39:07 - 39:12)
it on TV all I remember is that since (39:09 - 39:14)
then I've been saving up all my (39:12 - 39:16)
allowance for cars toys and games the (39:14 - 39:18)
latter was kind of difficult until I got (39:16 - 39:21)
a my Nintendo 2ds in Pokemon y which i (39:18 - 39:22)
still play I have one question that i (39:21 - 39:24)
would appreciate you being answered on (39:22 - 39:26)
the show I was wondering which type you (39:24 - 39:28)
think has the most Pokemon without (39:26 - 39:30)
looking it up online thanks for reading (39:28 - 39:33)
Chris from Michigan hmm it's either (39:30 - 39:36)
water or normal I know the answer and I (39:33 - 39:38)
didn't look it up i'm gonna guess water (39:36 - 39:41)
yeah it is water i actually don't know (39:38 - 39:43)
what the second most i think the second (39:41 - 39:47)
most might be normal flying has to be up (39:43 - 39:51)
there too yes most lying types are (39:47 - 39:54)
normal so right you all right there's a (39:51 - 39:56)
lot of normal pokemon that like (39:54 - 39:58)
Jigglypuff well Jaclyn well they're also (39:56 - 40:01)
normal fairy but she have wreck your (39:58 - 40:03)
piggies your raddatz has your Bidoof (40:01 - 40:10)
your Stoutland Lily pups Patrat are you (40:03 - 40:13)
just gonna list all Pokemon ago cuz we (40:10 - 40:15)
can we'll be here awhile that would be (40:13 - 40:17)
quite the episode are we correct before (40:15 - 40:19)
we move on we better actually make sure (40:17 - 40:21)
that we're right that water is the most (40:19 - 40:23)
populous tight oh it actually might be (40:21 - 40:28)
normal Oh No then we'll wins I'm on this (40:23 - 40:31)
bulbapedia article so I don't know the (40:28 - 40:33)
abundance of Pokemon type combinations (40:31 - 40:35)
it says (40:33 - 40:37)
Wow this doesn't seem right because (40:35 - 40:40)
they're separating it out by this normal (40:37 - 40:44)
has 60 but normal flying has 23 so just (40:40 - 40:45)
straight if we're looking at a straight (40:44 - 40:49)
single type Pokemon normal as the most (40:45 - 40:52)
in 64 look at straight water-type (40:49 - 40:55)
pokemon it's number two with 58 and then (40:52 - 40:59)
straight grass-type pokémon as 33 but (40:55 - 41:02)
then that's not taking in account like (40:59 - 41:06)
flying bug there are 14 flying bugs 20 (41:02 - 41:11)
you're fighting 23 normal flying with a (41:06 - 41:13)
very detailed chart its scientific yeah (41:11 - 41:17)
26 straight electric 15 straight fairy (41:13 - 41:22)
three dragon dark to ice Dark One ice (41:17 - 41:24)
dragon what's the one ice dragon psyche (41:22 - 41:28)
curium kiram yes 0 electric psychic i (41:24 - 41:30)
think the zeros are more exciting zero (41:28 - 41:34)
electric dark0 electric psychic zero (41:30 - 41:39)
fire fairy zero fire grass well that (41:34 - 41:43)
would be cool grass fire yeah you could (41:39 - 41:46)
be like a Savannah Pokemon zero steel (41:43 - 41:50)
ice zero gonna wear a wire in grass has (41:46 - 41:52)
to do with a city in Georgia no bug (41:50 - 41:56)
fairy no bug dark no bug dragon no bug (41:52 - 41:58)
ice no bugs psychic wow that's a lot of (41:56 - 42:02)
types that could be done no rock (41:58 - 42:06)
electric no rock ghost really no rock no (42:02 - 42:08)
ghostly right there's a ghost ground (42:06 - 42:11)
before oh oh yeah that's what I was (42:08 - 42:14)
thinking of no ground fairy no poison (42:11 - 42:18)
fairy poison fire nope poison steel nope (42:14 - 42:22)
fighting fairy nope fighting ghosts nope (42:18 - 42:24)
normal ice normal dragon normal dark (42:22 - 42:28)
that's all I know normal Rock normal bug (42:24 - 42:32)
normal ghost also know there's a lot of (42:28 - 42:35)
types there's no dark fairy type Pokemon (42:32 - 42:37)
so we're not going to get the pokemon (42:35 - 42:39)
equivalent to the neopets video game on (42:37 - 42:42)
the playstation 2 the darkest faerie no (42:39 - 42:45)
fire ice I don't know how that would (42:42 - 42:47)
work but I mean we have fire water (42:45 - 42:50)
yeah that would make sense cuz it's like (42:47 - 42:53)
steam yeah steam it's like Obama snow (42:50 - 42:56)
like grass ice that makes sense cuz it's (42:53 - 43:00)
like a tree like a winter tree well you (42:56 - 43:02)
got me there well kiram w couldn't been (43:00 - 43:05)
fire ice but they decided not to do that (43:02 - 43:08)
right yeah what a good question though (43:05 - 43:12)
I'm amazed at how many types don't have (43:08 - 43:15)
don't exist like fighting Fairy and I'm (43:12 - 43:16)
glad that for a seventh grader we can (43:15 - 43:18)
provide a level of appropriate humor (43:16 - 43:22)
coming from Travis you're never gonna (43:18 - 43:24)
let me live that joke down yeah we'll (43:22 - 43:25)
probably will probably forget by next (43:24 - 43:30)
week but Luke be wrightson in all caps (43:25 - 43:34)
hey the Shaymin guarantee no movie is so (43:30 - 43:36)
good sorry for that I am Luke by the way (43:34 - 43:38)
you guys are my favorite Pokemon (43:36 - 43:42)
podcasts to listen to by far much better (43:38 - 43:46)
than insert bad Pokemon podcast here I'm (43:42 - 43:48)
not making that that's what it says so (43:46 - 43:50)
you guys can mean that then this thing (43:48 - 43:52)
the thing about that shows you'd expect (43:50 - 43:55)
them to at least come up with a title (43:52 - 43:55)
will is my favorite co-host not saying I (43:55 - 44:02)
don't like Travis or Logan now I get it (43:58 - 44:06)
question is fair question do any of you (44:02 - 44:08)
play pokin or smash and will be willing (44:06 - 44:12)
to play I know what plays destiny I know (44:08 - 44:15)
you will play destiny with the PS (44:12 - 44:18)
hashtag ps4 or less I started listening (44:15 - 44:20)
you guys around episode 160 and you got (44:18 - 44:23)
me to play pokemon and you all got me to (44:20 - 44:25)
play pokemon shuffle yet i never got (44:23 - 44:28)
into it and quit the day and quit one (44:25 - 44:30)
day in in my opinion pokemon ranger is (44:28 - 44:32)
one of the most underrated spin-off (44:30 - 44:34)
games in the Pokemon universe or should (44:32 - 44:37)
I say the multiverse the game is so good (44:34 - 44:39)
if you haven't played it in my opinion (44:37 - 44:41)
it's one of the best games isn't there (44:39 - 44:45)
like four Ranger games yeah your shadows (44:41 - 44:48)
of Almia you got your guardian signs you (44:45 - 44:50)
got your original pokemon ranger which I (44:48 - 44:52)
don't think had a subtitle and I and (44:50 - 44:55)
that does the only ones i remember in my (44:52 - 44:56)
opinion it is the best because of so (44:55 - 44:58)
many features and it's extremely fun (44:56 - 45:01)
back in has extremely fun back in time (44:58 - 45:03)
and make it so much more fun that you (45:01 - 45:05)
should try it thanks for reading one (45:03 - 45:07)
last thing keep up the good work so the (45:05 - 45:09)
pokemon ranger we were talking about (45:07 - 45:11)
this on twitter but the pokemon ranger (45:09 - 45:14)
games have gotten re released for the (45:11 - 45:17)
wii u virtual console i know they have (45:14 - 45:19)
been in Europe but I don't know if they (45:17 - 45:23)
have been in the States I wouldn't be (45:19 - 45:25)
surprised if they were announced week (45:23 - 45:28)
that would be sweet accept no special (45:25 - 45:31)
missions so you can't get the manaphy (45:28 - 45:33)
egg I've know them up and find a way to (45:31 - 45:35)
edit or fix that because they definitely (45:33 - 45:39)
did that for red and blue and yellow but (45:35 - 45:41)
I I don't I guess what what's the point (45:39 - 45:43)
because you can download manaphy right (45:41 - 45:45)
now yes exactly there's there's really (45:43 - 45:47)
no point to it right alright last (45:45 - 45:52)
question here is from uh tanta bus dude (45:47 - 45:54)
it's in front of you I have no idea what (45:52 - 45:56)
I'm going with it sounds like a word my (45:54 - 45:58)
apologies if I slaughtered your name (45:56 - 46:00)
they write in you wake up with a (45:58 - 46:02)
pounding headache after a night of (46:00 - 46:05)
drinking an unhealthy amount of pokey (46:02 - 46:07)
potions you don't know where you are and (46:05 - 46:09)
you are approached by for Pokemon a (46:07 - 46:12)
gardevoir a jinx a lopunny any breaks (46:09 - 46:14)
and each of them carrying an egg they (46:12 - 46:17)
all claim to have bread with your ditto (46:14 - 46:19)
this is getting weird anyways I just (46:17 - 46:21)
sounds like a typical Saturday morning (46:19 - 46:24)
you may choose one egg to raise as your (46:21 - 46:25)
own which one do you choose and which (46:24 - 46:27)
one do you send to the distorted (46:25 - 46:30)
dimension may Arceus have mercy on their (46:27 - 46:32)
souls what what were my options again (46:30 - 46:36)
Gardevoir jinx lopunny and bricks and (46:32 - 46:38)
breaks and why would i send any of them (46:36 - 46:40)
to the distortion world when you can (46:38 - 46:42)
only pick one that means the other ones (46:40 - 46:43)
you know you don't know what happened to (46:42 - 46:46)
why can I only pick one I have a (46:43 - 46:48)
sufficient income and I'm a responsible (46:46 - 46:51)
adult hey I I didn't write the team of (46:48 - 46:54)
six yeah travis you go first because I'm (46:51 - 46:56)
completely emotionally wrecked by this (46:54 - 46:59)
question Gardevoir is a cool pokemon and (46:56 - 47:01)
it does lead to a lot of options right (46:59 - 47:04)
because you could that egg could turn (47:01 - 47:10)
into a guarded dude um what's his name (47:04 - 47:13)
Mike it's like I'm having a brain freeze (47:10 - 47:15)
Gallade guillod (47:13 - 47:19)
could turn into a god I remember our man (47:15 - 47:22)
and gar woman my two favorite pokemon i (47:19 - 47:25)
said gardna dude there's i was listening (47:22 - 47:27)
to the mix ler we've come full circle (47:25 - 47:30)
and that was it i think it was like (47:27 - 47:33)
episode 112 / 113 it was when we first (47:30 - 47:36)
started talking about fairy type or (47:33 - 47:38)
maybe even prior to that and I remember (47:36 - 47:42)
Travis being slightly upset because (47:38 - 47:45)
Gardevoir would become a fairy type yeah (47:42 - 47:49)
but I think if I like it now I've I I've (47:45 - 47:53)
come around very cool fairies a really (47:49 - 47:55)
really cool type one of my favorites not (47:53 - 47:58)

number one team rocket team pack with (51:35 - 51:40)
team logo in the Pokemon zubat and (51:38 - 51:43)
ratata number two official Pokemon pins (51:40 - 51:48)
hungry number three Pokemon Center (51:43 - 51:51)
original recommended age six years in op (51:48 - 51:53)
country of origin made in China material (51:51 - 51:56)

dimensions point two five American (51:58 - 52:04)
inches seven American inches height 3.8 (52:00 - 52:07)
American inches length I really really (52:04 - 52:10)
doubt these are seven American inches (52:07 - 52:13)
tall probably the box look really (52:10 - 52:16)
something choking hazard small parts not (52:13 - 52:19)
for children under three years (52:16 - 52:23)
functional sharp shiny points and (52:19 - 52:26)
contains functional sharp points not for (52:23 - 52:28)
children who or seven months out now (52:26 - 52:31)
it's not for children under four years (52:28 - 52:34)
looks like at three you can show at (52:31 - 52:37)
three you know like I shouldn't swallow (52:34 - 52:39)
a thing that's gonna kill me but you (52:37 - 52:42)
don't know I shouldn't poke a thing into (52:39 - 52:45)
me that wolf I shouldn't hurt so it says (52:42 - 52:47)
functional sharp points not for children (52:45 - 52:49)
then above it says recommended age six (52:47 - 52:53)
years and up would you I I think just (52:49 - 52:55)
because of the mature themes yes those (52:53 - 52:57)
five year olds are in the gray zone I I (52:55 - 52:59)
know a lot of two-year-olds and (52:57 - 53:04)
three-year-olds I can't I don't know I (52:59 - 53:05)
haven't been around a six-year-old a (53:04 - 53:08)
while and clearly in two to three years (53:05 - 53:09)
I will be around a six-year-old because (53:08 - 53:13)
kids spoiler they their age gets older (53:09 - 53:20)
with time but would would you give up (53:13 - 53:24)
into spoiled the ending of kids all (53:20 - 53:25)
right would you give up into a (53:24 - 53:27)
six-year-old I feel like that's still (53:25 - 53:29)
kind of dangerous calm pins are pretty (53:27 - 53:32)
sharp okay so the issue isn't the kids (53:29 - 53:36)
themselves it's it's the parents (53:32 - 53:38)
and there are a lot of really dumb (53:36 - 53:41)
parents out there because it does not (53:38 - 53:43)
take any kind of education to have a (53:41 - 53:46)
baby but it actually raised one properly (53:43 - 53:50)
takes a little bit of intelligence so (53:46 - 53:53)
that's yeah accra see we know that that (53:50 - 53:56)
he knows narrative that gap is where (53:53 - 53:58)
people are using the team rocket pins to (53:56 - 54:02)
hold the diaper together um so mmm (53:58 - 54:05)
that's what you got to watch out for I (54:02 - 54:06)
also don't think like a six-year-old (54:05 - 54:11)
would be that enthralled with a pin like (54:06 - 54:13)
yeah you could put on their bag and they (54:11 - 54:15)
probably would leave it alone but I feel (54:13 - 54:17)
like they're short attention span would (54:15 - 54:19)
be okay I got the pin now I don't care (54:17 - 54:24)
moving on to the next toy in line also (54:19 - 54:26)
why is that you can i plug it into my (54:24 - 54:29)
Skylanders nevitt bite why is it a zoo (54:26 - 54:30)
bed in a rattata why is it not a (54:29 - 54:33)
coughing urine Ekans well okay okay okay (54:30 - 54:35)
I have a little bone to pick with that (54:33 - 54:38)
particular argument because team rocket (54:35 - 54:41)
changes out there like the pokemon that (54:38 - 54:45)
they use as the generations go on so (54:41 - 54:47)
honestly if you really wanted the core (54:45 - 54:49)
pokemon that they truly love and feel (54:47 - 54:50)
are part of their team you'd want to (54:49 - 54:52)
boba fett enemy out because well the fat (54:50 - 54:54)
keeps coming back I don't think the team (54:52 - 54:56)
rocket from the anime I think it's (54:54 - 54:57)
supposed to be team rocket from (54:56 - 54:59)
generations 12 and they would often use (54:57 - 55:01)
Rattata and zoo bet there's also that (54:59 - 55:03)
you are correct yeah but aren't you (55:01 - 55:07)
going for mass appeal now apparently not (55:03 - 55:13)
clearly not all right Pokemon the week (55:07 - 55:13)
this week's pokémon of the week is (55:13 - 55:19)
stoutland the normal type pokemon (55:16 - 55:23)
pokemon the big hard animal type Pokemon (55:19 - 55:27)
the big-hearted pokemon as (55:23 - 55:30)
the pokedex claims involves from her (55:27 - 55:33)
tier which evolves from Lily pup it is (55:30 - 55:36)
well Lily pop I feel like is the (55:33 - 55:39)
original puppy Pokemon I agree but now (55:36 - 55:40)
getting passed up from this new (55:39 - 55:44)
generation 7 the hot stuffs coming in (55:40 - 55:46)
and push and Lily pup and stout went off (55:44 - 55:49)
to the side and it was my first shiny (55:46 - 55:53)
lillybot no well I yeah I caught it as a (55:49 - 55:54)
little pup but I evolved it into a (55:53 - 55:57)
stoutland interesting southland is a (55:54 - 55:59)
canine Pokemon with a talent for (55:57 - 56:03)
rescuing people lost at sea what wait a (55:59 - 56:07)
second install and learn surf uh (56:03 - 56:10)
possible I I think it connect again yeah (56:07 - 56:13)
I just scroll down alright fair enough (56:10 - 56:16)
let's continue reading solid as a canine (56:13 - 56:18)
Pokemon with the talent for rescuing (56:16 - 56:20)
people lost at sea or in the mountains (56:18 - 56:23)
on its face and as a cream it has cream (56:20 - 56:26)
colored fur that forms a volume asst (56:23 - 56:29)
white-tipped plumes and a three-point (56:26 - 56:32)
crest the plumes are so long that they (56:29 - 56:34)
run the length of its body and bunch (56:32 - 56:37)
close to it it has a toughy it has Tuffy (56:34 - 56:39)
pointed ears with blue insides a black (56:37 - 56:41)
nose surrounded by the short black (56:39 - 56:43)
whiskers and small eyes that are nearly (56:41 - 56:46)
hidden behind its facial fur his body is (56:43 - 56:49)
covered with shaggy fur that is dark (56:46 - 56:51)
blue along the back and grayish blue (56:49 - 56:54)
towards the legs this first thick enough (56:51 - 56:57)
to protect itself against freezing (56:54 - 56:59)
temperatures its face and paws our light (56:57 - 57:01)
brown and each paw has three toes with (56:59 - 57:05)
white claws blue paw pads can be seen on (57:01 - 57:10)
each paw in the pokédex 3d pro app (57:05 - 57:13)
product placement there fifty percent (57:10 - 57:15)
male fifty percent female travis has (57:13 - 57:18)
moveset Stalin is really cool pokemon (57:15 - 57:20)
specifically because it gets access to (57:18 - 57:24)
sand rush which is an ability that makes (57:20 - 57:27)
it so that well first you're immune to (57:24 - 57:30)
the effects of sandstorm you're immune (57:27 - 57:32)
to the damaging effects of stand storm (57:30 - 57:34)
but more importantly your speed is (57:32 - 57:39)
doubled under sandstorm we can do is run (57:34 - 57:41)
stoutland in a sand (57:39 - 57:45)
team with a choice band so your speed (57:41 - 57:47)
goes from the normal 80 which isn't that (57:45 - 57:52)
great to 160 when you're under sandstorm (57:47 - 57:54)
which is a lot and your attack is (57:52 - 57:56)
already 110 which is quite good so slap (57:54 - 57:58)
a choice band on there and you're not (57:56 - 57:59)
only going to be out speeding a lot of (57:58 - 58:01)
Pokemon but you're going to be one heck (57:59 - 58:04)
a owing a lot of them even a lot of (58:01 - 58:06)
walls too because you're just dishing (58:04 - 58:09)
out so much damage for v's as you say (58:06 - 58:10)
you're going to do an adamant nature (58:09 - 58:14)
with 250 2 v's and attack and speed for (58:10 - 58:17)
in HP or defense or something and in (58:14 - 58:20)
terms of moves you want return just for (58:17 - 58:26)
the highest base attack normal move you (58:20 - 58:29)
can get your hands on crunch so I guess (58:26 - 58:31)
in going into crunch and the other moves (58:29 - 58:33)
the other ones will just give you better (58:31 - 58:35)
type coverage and since we're doing (58:33 - 58:37)
choice band we just basically want for (58:35 - 58:40)
attacking moves so we're gonna do return (58:37 - 58:44)
crunch super power and shoot what's the (58:40 - 58:48)
electric move its wild wild charge yeah (58:44 - 58:51)
wild charge so you're so so its return (58:48 - 58:53)
crunch super power and wild charge it (58:51 - 58:55)
gives you a pretty good type coverage (58:53 - 58:58)
and I mean just a normal type on its own (58:55 - 58:59)
gives you good type coverage with the (58:58 - 59:04)
exception of steel and rock and although (58:59 - 59:07)
and both of those you you cover with (59:04 - 59:09)
superpowers you've got a lot of your (59:07 - 59:12)
types cover oh and and ghost you don't (59:09 - 59:13)
have but you can get that with with (59:12 - 59:15)
crunch so you've got a lot of types (59:13 - 59:17)
covered and you're doing a lot of damage (59:15 - 59:21)
with a pretty regal looking dog did you (59:17 - 59:23)
said sand rush as the ability yeah yeah (59:21 - 59:28)
because otherwise like I think in so so (59:23 - 59:31)
Stoutland actually got some play in VGC (59:28 - 59:33)
2011 when the rules stipulated that you (59:31 - 59:35)
could only use you know a Pokemon if I (59:33 - 59:40)
remember correctly it was the used the (59:35 - 59:44)
intimidate ability because I don't think (59:40 - 59:47)
I think we saw whether that very much (59:44 - 59:50)
that year because there we didn't have (59:47 - 59:53)
access to Pokemon that would set it up (59:50 - 59:55)
yeah immediately Tyrannis (59:53 - 59:56)
r is your typical sand streamer right (59:55 - 59:59)
right which we didn't have access to and (59:56 - 60:01)
I don't think there any you know a (59:59 - 60:03)
Pokemon that did I mean it's like again (60:01 - 60:05)
that was five years ago so my memory is (60:03 - 60:08)
a little hazy but I think in that (60:05 - 60:10)
version they ran the and they ran it (60:08 - 60:12)
with intimidate because that ability is (60:10 - 60:16)
just so great in doubles because it hits (60:12 - 60:19)
both the opponent's and if I remember (60:16 - 60:21)
right that was a pretty physically heavy (60:19 - 60:23)
meta that year so I think there is a (60:21 - 60:26)
stoutland maybe even on the winning team (60:23 - 60:27)
that sort of caught people by surprise (60:26 - 60:29)
but other than that you're typically (60:27 - 60:30)
going to see it with sand rush because (60:29 - 60:33)
that's going to cover the weakness of (60:30 - 60:38)
the only 80 speed tiny stoutland is (60:33 - 60:40)
definitely shiny it's more of a green (60:38 - 60:44)
than a blue and is its face whiskers (60:40 - 60:45)
which are normally like a cream color (60:44 - 60:48)
they're like a gold which is really cool (60:45 - 60:52)
will has one yes are you said are you (60:48 - 60:54)
satisfied with the shininess of your (60:52 - 60:57)
shiny um I I think I'm very happy with (60:54 - 60:59)
it I can't remember if I gave that one (60:57 - 61:01)
away or not but the golden many (60:59 - 61:05)
pokeballs out of 5 would you give it I'd (61:01 - 61:07)
say a 4 4 out of 5 yeah because that (61:05 - 61:10)
golden mane is like what makes it yeah (61:07 - 61:13)
uh not that much trivia here southland (61:10 - 61:14)
was based on the comp finish combination (61:13 - 61:20)
of a shi zhu zhu zhu and a Maltese with (61:14 - 61:22)
some characteristics of a yorkshire's (61:20 - 61:25)
and as Scottish terrier it's talented (61:22 - 61:27)
wish every kind of dog right its talent (61:25 - 61:29)
for rescuing humans and mountains is (61:27 - 61:32)
similar to the st. Bernard I don't know (61:29 - 61:34)
dogs that well so it doesn't mean much (61:32 - 61:36)
to me st. Bernard is the one that has (61:34 - 61:39)
the Cask of like brandy around its neck (61:36 - 61:42)
mmm wow that just shows our age (61:39 - 61:44)
difference of guys that used to be in (61:42 - 61:48)
all the cartoons oh we we we should just (61:44 - 61:51)
jump back a little bit and talk about (61:48 - 61:55)
our thoughts with the koala and dog we (61:51 - 61:57)
didn't actually do that oh the koalas (61:55 - 62:00)
cool alright good we gonna bility it's (61:57 - 62:02)
it's hugging a little stumped which is (62:00 - 62:06)
funny cuz wall is hang onto trees it's (62:02 - 62:08)
cute are there where are their koalas in (62:06 - 62:09)
Hawaii (62:08 - 62:11)
there are no koalas all right there are (62:09 - 62:14)
booked months so unreal what are the (62:11 - 62:18)
stomach pouch mammals called kozue peels (62:14 - 62:21)
marsupials so marsupials are only in (62:18 - 62:24)
Australia and koalas are marsupials all (62:21 - 62:26)
right what I was going to say is every (62:24 - 62:27)
year at the pokemon company (62:26 - 62:30)
international there is a contest to (62:27 - 62:32)
determine who will design the pokemon (62:30 - 62:35)
that can sell the most plushies who will (62:32 - 62:38)
sell the most stuffed animals and (62:35 - 62:40)
obviously these are two top contenders (62:38 - 62:43)
because people are going to buy neck o (62:40 - 62:47)
Allah merchandise until the end of days (62:43 - 62:48)
because it's going to be everybody's (62:47 - 62:51)
favorite one to have as a stuffed animal (62:48 - 62:52)
do you think the Koala is going to go (62:51 - 62:56)
down the same path as what is it pangoro (62:52 - 62:59)
as it going to turn dark or just like uh (62:56 - 63:02)
no like a slack King where they're just (62:59 - 63:05)
like that so easy I think it's gonna be (63:02 - 63:07)
like a slack off vigorous lacking kind (63:05 - 63:10)
of deal where it's gonna like have a (63:07 - 63:13)
middle evolution that's like has what is (63:10 - 63:15)
it well vital spirits one of them but (63:13 - 63:16)
there's another one where it can't ever (63:15 - 63:21)
fall asleep insomnia and Sonia is that (63:16 - 63:23)
what worry seed gives you yeah I gives (63:21 - 63:24)
you the ability but I think there might (63:23 - 63:26)
even be a third one that that's the same (63:24 - 63:28)
effect I just like then we already had a (63:26 - 63:30)
level ooh she will be more like super (63:28 - 63:33)
bulky and super sleepy also I looked it (63:30 - 63:34)
up and there are marsupials in the (63:33 - 63:39)
American continent possums yeah (63:34 - 63:41)
something like that but it just says on (63:39 - 63:43)
the wikipedia page it says there are a (63:41 - 63:46)
100 species of marsupials found in the (63:43 - 63:48)
Americas particularly in South America (63:46 - 63:51)
but 13 in Central America and one lonely (63:48 - 63:54)
species in North America in the north of (63:51 - 63:57)
Mexico which is what possum oh I guess (63:54 - 63:59)
this is north of Mexico so maybe now (63:57 - 64:01)
because there's no possums in mex Mexico (63:59 - 64:03)
possums are up here oh yeah there I (64:01 - 64:06)
don't we've already seen like that (64:03 - 64:09)
sleeping lazy Pokemon in like slacking (64:06 - 64:12)
and Snorlax it is that the main we've (64:09 - 64:14)
already seen doug pokemon or yet another (64:12 - 64:15)
one why you've always be another way (64:14 - 64:17)
kokum we're getting a rock dog that's a (64:15 - 64:19)
little different but it's i think i mean (64:17 - 64:22)
its ability is the main quality of a (64:19 - 64:22)
co-op (64:22 - 64:26)
to sleep no but they're super cute yeah (64:22 - 64:27)
but aren't they also like super (64:26 - 64:29)
dangerous don't like more people die (64:27 - 64:33)
from koalas than they do I don't think (64:29 - 64:36)
that's true but i do believe or koala (64:33 - 64:38)
attacks in shark attacks he heard it (64:36 - 64:40)
here first I believe that koalas are (64:38 - 64:43)
more violent than people expect them to (64:40 - 64:47)
be I would be okay with like I don't (64:43 - 64:50)
know like a very attack heavy mobile (64:47 - 64:53)
evolution of the sleepy koala instead of (64:50 - 64:56)
going down like the oh it's just like (64:53 - 64:58)
another Snorlax I was gonna say if your (64:56 - 65:01)
entire diet consisted of one kind of (64:58 - 65:05)
leaf you'd be in pretty bad mood as well (65:01 - 65:07)
what about what about the daughter (65:05 - 65:11)
dinner today Oh eucalyptus again yo ever (65:07 - 65:13)
exact pan Reza that life is it know (65:11 - 65:16)
Nana's and koalas just eat eucalyptus Oh (65:13 - 65:19)
pandas eat bamboo dude oh yeah a bamboo (65:16 - 65:22)
it up all right rock dog I'm showing my (65:19 - 65:24)
ignorance all right so I immediately got (65:22 - 65:28)
angry texts and and otherwise about what (65:24 - 65:30)
makes this dog rock and to that I would (65:28 - 65:32)
answer with the question what makes a (65:30 - 65:37)
gogoat grass what makes a chair a jar (65:32 - 65:41)
look I'm out of college those days about (65:37 - 65:44)
those days of philosophizing of the (65:41 - 65:46)
essence of a chair behind me I would (65:44 - 65:49)
rather keep it that way is a hot dog a (65:46 - 65:53)
sandwich would you stop stop this we do (65:49 - 65:54)
not need to lower the intelligence (65:53 - 65:56)
quality of this book podcast any lower (65:54 - 65:59)
than it has already fallen it's I mean I (65:56 - 66:02)
did just say that pandas only eucalyptus (65:59 - 66:04)
and and somehow you managed to make it (66:02 - 66:09)
more done than that um so it has a stone (66:04 - 66:13)
collar that's what makes it a rock-type (66:09 - 66:16)
mystery solved also i can matt i can (66:13 - 66:20)
imagine why you know how dogs when (66:16 - 66:21)
they're wet they do they like to shake (66:20 - 66:24)
off they like shake off the waters I (66:21 - 66:26)
don't know what the technical term of (66:24 - 66:30)
that it's called a perfect yeah so I can (66:26 - 66:35)
imagine with my imagination when you go (66:30 - 66:36)
with the (66:35 - 66:38)
rock dog shakes but instead of water (66:36 - 66:40)
coming off like little pebbles come out (66:38 - 66:43)
of it oh that's one dirty dog you know (66:40 - 66:48)

that gonna be the new tagline of it's (66:48 - 66:51)
super effective it's super effective (66:50 - 66:58)
what a dirty dog but I think I think (66:51 - 67:03)
that's good to lay out a Pokemon and say (66:58 - 67:07)
this is its this is a this what it does (67:03 - 67:11)
and for you to like imagine that (67:07 - 67:12)
like oh yeah I could I could imagine (67:11 - 67:16)
that Pokemon being real sure it's I mean (67:12 - 67:18)
the only pokemon I imagine not being (67:16 - 67:20)
real is Basque alone but we can move on (67:18 - 67:22)
from that I mean n board is normal type (67:20 - 67:25)

Rock doggy wow that's cool I'm happy (67:32 - 67:38)
with both these Pokemon drapion is dark (67:35 - 67:40)

looks poison bug real cool drapion is a (67:40 - 67:46)
very cool welcome on but it doesn't make (67:43 - 67:48)
sense why it's dark while loops because (67:46 - 67:51)
it's or evil and it is buggy so the evil (67:48 - 67:53)
/ fight dirty it's a it's a it's a it's (67:51 - 67:57)

said well we can give you a room with AV (69:49 - 69:56)
equipment microphone speakers but it can (69:54 - 69:59)
only hold 60 people and that would cost (69:56 - 70:02)
money because the AV stuff or we can (69:59 - 70:03)
give you a room that holds a hundred (70:02 - 70:08)
people with no AV stuff for free so I (70:03 - 70:11)
took the room with no AV stuff because I (70:08 - 70:13)
