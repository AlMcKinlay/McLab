bits that are life impacting but you (1:22 - 1:29)

Pokemon news we have some Pokemon Go (2:13 - 2:18)
news of course guess we can talk about (2:15 - 2:20)
the Cynthia that arrived in Pokemon (2:18 - 2:22)
masters there was a Pokemon sword and (2:20 - 2:24)
shield event in the last week if you (2:22 - 2:26)
missed it you missed it it's overnight (2:24 - 2:28)
but we can we could talk about it (2:26 - 2:31)
because it was really cool and the new (2:28 - 2:33)
competitive has started in sword and (2:31 - 2:36)
shield and that's it that's that's what (2:33 - 2:37)
we got to talk about today hopefully you (2:36 - 2:39)
all had a happy (2:37 - 2:42)
without further delay let's let's kick (2:39 - 2:44)
off the news with the most exciting news (2:42 - 2:48)
first and then it'll be all downhill (2:44 - 2:52)
this is James from our slack community (2:48 - 2:55)
sent this in off Nintendo live.com your (2:52 - 3:03)
next Pokemon Build A Bear is flareon ooh (2:55 - 3:06)
I know at least two people who love (3:03 - 3:10)
Flareon at least two we can we just say (3:06 - 3:12)
only two I mean I can't say that (3:10 - 3:14)
scientifically other Pokemon No (3:12 - 3:17)
how do those two people feel about (3:14 - 3:20)
always being wrong in life well what was (3:17 - 3:26)
your roommate so how did he feel very (3:20 - 3:28)
wrong in life he's making furniture now (3:26 - 3:30)
so you know he makes him beautiful (3:28 - 3:35)
furniture he died he built a bear is (3:30 - 3:37)
continuing their collaboration with (3:35 - 3:40)
Pokemon which is actually probably the (3:37 - 3:42)
more exciting news here that (3:40 - 3:43)
build-a-bear and Pokemon have this (3:42 - 3:45)
relationship that they haven't gotten (3:43 - 3:49)
divorced yet strong it's very impressive (3:45 - 3:51)
the latest addition to the Pokemon (3:49 - 3:53)
build-a-bear lineup is Flareon an (3:51 - 3:55)
evolution of the already available Eevee (3:53 - 3:57)
it is the first evolution of Eevee we've (3:55 - 3:59)
seen it in build-a-bear form this is (3:57 - 4:02)
purely speculation on our part we can (3:59 - 4:03)
imagine this could mean we could see (4:02 - 4:08)
more EVs in the future you know I'm glad (4:03 - 4:09)
you wrote it that way Nintendo left (4:08 - 4:12)
because that is true we shouldn't assume (4:09 - 4:14)
but what I can I can tell you as (4:12 - 4:16)
somebody who is deep in the Pokemon (4:14 - 4:19)
community whether that is for better or (4:16 - 4:21)
for worse we do joke about flare out (4:19 - 4:23)
being the least popular but it is it is (4:21 - 4:26)
the least popular it's wait it's even (4:23 - 4:28)
less popular in Vaporeon obey programs (4:26 - 4:31)
very popular cards we dig fishy tale (4:28 - 4:35)
thing it's cute no area doesn't even (4:31 - 4:37)
benefit from (4:35 - 4:44)
being good competitive okay we're not (4:37 - 4:47)
all here for your battle amusements (4:44 - 4:50)
Caesar I mean that's what the game is is (4:47 - 4:56)
battle amusements the game so that my (4:50 - 4:59)
tinfoil hat theory this is this is all (4:56 - 5:01)
this is all Tony Tony my tinfoil hat (4:59 - 5:03)
theory is some of the most popular Eevee (5:01 - 5:05)
evolutions I would say top three are (5:03 - 5:07)
probably Umbreon Espeon and sylveon (5:05 - 5:08)
those are probably top three (5:07 - 5:11)
statistically I could agree with you yes (5:08 - 5:14)
I have a sylveon hat and I think because (5:11 - 5:16)
Flareon is the worst my theory is (5:14 - 5:18)
they're starting with the worst so they (5:16 - 5:22)
know baseline what sales should be going (5:18 - 5:23)
forward (5:22 - 5:26)
okay two things number one please don't (5:23 - 5:28)
ever say 2020 for the rest of the year (5:26 - 5:29)
because every time somebody says that (5:28 - 5:31)
now I'm confused whether they're (5:29 - 5:32)
referencing the year or whether they're (5:31 - 5:34)
referencing clear vision so that's a (5:32 - 5:51)
band for this program show that they did (5:34 - 5:53)
what was the first build-a-bear Pokemon (5:51 - 5:56)
they do yeah so was that like the least (5:53 - 5:58)
loved one so they could find out whether (5:56 - 5:59)
it be a successful business venture at (5:58 - 6:00)
that point (5:59 - 6:03)
no they you don't put you don't collab (6:00 - 6:05)
with build-a-bear and expect Pikachu not (6:03 - 6:08)
to sell did you start with like (6:05 - 6:11)
Bulbasaur no no well no bubble stars (6:08 - 6:12)
popular it's number one in the Pokedex (6:11 - 6:14)
it's obviously the most popular Pokemon (6:12 - 6:17)
ah because that's how that was else (6:14 - 6:19)
think that Larry ends face and this (6:17 - 6:21)
picture is really pitched really weird (6:19 - 6:25)
yeah pinchy you can't I mean you could (6:21 - 6:29)
you could just do Umbreon and Espeon but (6:25 - 6:30)
then people that but then you fall into (6:29 - 6:32)
the trap of people demanding the other (6:30 - 6:35)
ones so with Pikachu it's like one and (6:32 - 6:37)
done right we did the Pikachu it sold (6:35 - 6:39)
millions Eevee (6:37 - 6:41)
sold millions all right well we really (6:39 - 6:43)
want to give people sylveon Espeon an (6:41 - 6:45)
Umbreon but we can't give them three of (6:43 - 6:49)
the no a seven eight how many are there (6:45 - 6:51)
we have to eventually give them Flair (6:49 - 6:54)
so it's like it's like the it's like the (6:51 - 6:57)
bandaid on your arm (6:54 - 6:58)
you just gotta rip it off all right (6:57 - 7:00)
here's your flare add quickly get it out (6:58 - 7:03)
the door okay it only sold five all (7:00 - 7:06)
right well at least we know we can tell (7:03 - 7:08)
our build-a-bear stockholders you can (7:06 - 7:11)
fear not this look we've we already knew (7:08 - 7:13)
this was our worst selling Eevee (7:11 - 7:16)
evolution I'm I'm a little confused (7:13 - 7:20)
because the the actual Eevee that they (7:16 - 7:23)
did for build-a-bear is super cute is (7:20 - 7:25)
very cute buzzer is probably the best (7:23 - 7:26)
one they've done (7:25 - 7:31)
does the Flareon play weird Ben trace it (7:26 - 7:35)
looks like a gray from a spaceship (7:31 - 7:37)
that's coming to take me away and (7:35 - 7:39)
perform weird medical experiments on me (7:37 - 7:42)
in their UFO that's the kind of face it (7:39 - 7:46)
has yeah it's and their orbital get it (7:42 - 7:47)
get it (7:46 - 7:50)
give paw Qumran pun and you said the UFO (7:47 - 7:53)
and I changed it to their orbital I (7:50 - 7:56)
don't know what an orbital is yeah (7:53 - 7:57)
that's gonna be a loss of the person (7:56 - 8:04)
that has to I've told you the story of (7:57 - 8:07)
the octillery I just I need a moment (8:04 - 8:10)
well as you take a moment we'll move on (8:07 - 8:12)
to our Pokemon masters news we kind of (8:10 - 8:14)
touched on this last week with my (8:12 - 8:18)
masters Cynthia and Ray or Lance and (8:14 - 8:20)
Cynthia were added but not at the same (8:18 - 8:22)
time even though they both appeared in (8:20 - 8:24)
the I don't know hallway event hall I (8:22 - 8:26)
don't know what that is space is called (8:24 - 8:40)
the big Pokemon Center hallway everybody (8:26 - 8:43)
Cynthia's now available yep I'm older (8:40 - 8:46)
yet I have pulled her the so gaily event (8:43 - 8:51)
is now on yep they what's the team a (8:46 - 8:53)
Pokemon masters they they said don't (8:51 - 8:54)
worry everyone (8:53 - 8:58)
it's easier that view to I was able to (8:54 - 9:02)
do the so gaily event in less than an (8:58 - 9:05)
hour just by hitting the like battle (9:02 - 9:05)
again (9:05 - 9:07)
and over and over and I think I got like (9:05 - 9:09)
10 tickets every time and you need a (9:07 - 9:11)
hundred and then you get so Gallio or so (9:09 - 9:12)
Galia (9:11 - 9:13)
so go Leo I think is how you say okay (9:12 - 9:18)
Leo you get so go Leo and I have it but (9:13 - 9:20)
there's more missions after it I think (9:18 - 9:23)
team Lear know the dude's name is Lear (9:20 - 9:27)
what is the bad team name team ask I (9:23 - 9:29)
don't know they show up (9:27 - 9:33)
no this isn't pokemon dual I can't beat (9:29 - 9:35)
them yet and then I realized so this is (9:33 - 9:38)
my question for you Greg yes when you go (9:35 - 9:39)
to Trisha its (9:38 - 9:42)
F is team break great got it when you go (9:39 - 9:45)
to Trisha she wants a million tickets (9:42 - 9:47)
sure first she wants 400 and then she (9:45 - 9:49)
wants like 600 and then she wants a (9:47 - 9:51)
thousand where am i yeah I was only (9:49 - 9:53)
getting ten ticket submission who is (9:51 - 9:56)
grinding out 4,000 tickets and why like (9:53 - 9:58)
I already have the so Kaleo (9:56 - 10:02)
but okay so the first time you do the (9:58 - 10:05)
first three coops you get boosted (10:02 - 10:07)
tickets what you thought I've wasted (10:05 - 10:12)
like 200 yeah so I think I ended up (10:07 - 10:15)
today with 300 after I ran everything (10:12 - 10:19)
today just from running those three for (10:15 - 10:21)
the coop because it's super I haven't (10:19 - 10:22)
done the fourth one because the fourth (10:21 - 10:25)
one like so in the weird thing is in the (10:22 - 10:27)
Mewtwo event you used to get you get mu (10:25 - 10:29)
2 tickets from the first three but you (10:27 - 10:31)
did get it for the hardest one you got (10:29 - 10:33)
gems maybe it looks like it's the same (10:31 - 10:35)
this way you don't get tickets when you (10:33 - 10:38)
do the fourth event you just get gems so (10:35 - 10:39)
I haven't run the fourth one because (10:38 - 10:42)
it's difficult and running it with (10:39 - 10:45)
strangers where you can't communicate is (10:42 - 10:47)
just frustrating so I've skipped it but (10:45 - 10:51)
every day when you run those co-op ones (10:47 - 10:53)
the first time you get boosted tickets (10:51 - 10:55)
which is the only way to get tickets to (10:53 - 10:59)
power up your pair well you hat well if (10:55 - 11:00)
you have Cynthia I don't think you have (10:59 - 11:01)
to communicate right how are people (11:00 - 11:03)
going in with three Cynthia's yeah (11:01 - 11:06)
except the fourth one generally if you (11:03 - 11:09)
don't do the exact prescribed thing (11:06 - 11:11)
you'll get wiped out this is the way it (11:09 - 11:14)
was from you to like if somebody didn't (11:11 - 11:16)
come in with a way to eliminate their (11:14 - 11:18)
stat increases they one-shot everybody (11:16 - 11:19)
so (11:18 - 11:22)
I haven't done it because I'm not like (11:19 - 11:24)
the mutual and was so frustrating that I (11:22 - 11:27)
decided that I didn't want to be (11:24 - 11:29)
frustrated running this once I've just (11:27 - 11:31)
been doing the first leap but the first (11:29 - 11:33)
the everyday if you run those first (11:31 - 11:36)
three you get extra super extra tickets (11:33 - 11:36)
okay (11:36 - 11:39)
I haven't unlocked the co-op stuff yet (11:36 - 11:42)
oh yeah you need to do I'm on like (11:39 - 11:45)
chapter 9 which I think is I think (11:42 - 11:50)
there's 18 chapters um no I think (11:45 - 11:53)
there's 16 oh okay well I might be 18 I (11:50 - 11:55)
don't know I'm not there I'm making it (11:53 - 11:58)
you didn't beat the story so co-op this (11:55 - 12:00)
is a sub where any story I'm assuming (11:58 - 12:00)
yeah (12:00 - 12:02)
so I would love I have a love-hate (12:00 - 12:03)
relationship with this game because of (12:02 - 12:07)
the play there's 20 chapters oh I have a (12:03 - 12:09)
love/hate relationship with this game (12:07 - 12:12)
mm-hmm I have hit the wall you talked (12:09 - 12:17)
about I need a bunch of red soda yep so (12:12 - 12:19)
I guess I described missions for red (12:17 - 12:20)
soda (12:19 - 12:22)
I suppose yep and this is this is my (12:20 - 12:25)
biggest complaint with the game is that (12:22 - 12:28)
grinding those you can't you can't auto (12:25 - 12:31)
skip it like you can't you have to play (12:28 - 12:33)
the game because they're auto function (12:31 - 12:37)
is still real not great unlike a lot of (12:33 - 12:39)
other Gacha games where you slowly over (12:37 - 12:42)
time build up skip tickets there's no (12:39 - 12:44)
such thing in this game so I can't say (12:42 - 12:49)
well I need 50 more Oh see this is where (12:44 - 12:50)
your knowledge comes in because you play (12:49 - 12:52)
out the gotcha game so they have the (12:50 - 12:54)
same grind but you can just pay to skip (12:52 - 12:56)
it with tickets that you earn that (12:54 - 12:58)
you've earned so like in other games I (12:56 - 13:00)
can just say well I need some more I (12:58 - 13:03)
need some more light orbs I'll go to the (13:00 - 13:04)
light orbs one that have already (13:03 - 13:06)
completed it knows that I've done it and (13:04 - 13:10)
I'll just hit the skip ticket option and (13:06 - 13:12)
it just says okay here's your rewards (13:10 - 13:15)
because you I've already proven to the (13:12 - 13:17)
game that I've done this so what (13:15 - 13:19)
frustrates me and masters is I've proven (13:17 - 13:21)
to the game that I've done this many (13:19 - 13:24)
many many times I should be able to just (13:21 - 13:28)
say please don't waste my time making me (13:24 - 13:30)
do this again let me have it an option (13:28 - 13:33)
to spend a ticket to skip it (13:30 - 13:35)
and then earning those tickets can be (13:33 - 13:39)
difficult or slow but like give me (13:35 - 13:41)
something that allows me to power up (13:39 - 13:44)
quickly so I don't have to feel like all (13:41 - 13:46)
I'm doing is grinding and that's what (13:44 - 13:49)
often turns me off playing masters like (13:46 - 13:51)
right now I'm playing the sole Galia one (13:49 - 13:53)
the co-op stuff is pretty easy for the (13:51 - 13:55)
first three I can breeze through them (13:53 - 13:57)
you know they're kind of fun but like (13:55 - 13:58)
the thought of trying to complete (13:57 - 14:01)
chapter 20 because I have to level up a (13:58 - 14:03)
certain sink pair to be able to do it (14:01 - 14:05)
which means I have to grind and there's (14:03 - 14:07)
no good way of grinding that that's (14:05 - 14:09)
often where I'm like I'm just gonna not (14:07 - 14:11)
play the game for a while because I I'm (14:09 - 14:14)
so frustrated having to grind with no (14:11 - 14:17)
quick way past it I was gonna ask like (14:14 - 14:19)
how how what keeps you going back all (14:17 - 14:21)
the time but if you're gonna be taking a (14:19 - 14:24)
break then that's nice I take a lot of (14:21 - 14:27)
breaks from Pokemon masters that's (14:24 - 14:28)
that's a good question because for me (14:27 - 14:31)
cuz I ignored this game for a couple (14:28 - 14:33)
months besides like logging in and (14:31 - 14:35)
getting gems right there they've been (14:33 - 14:39)
the the Pokemon master DNA the publisher (14:35 - 14:41)
of not publisher the developer of (14:39 - 14:44)
Pokemon masters has definitely given out (14:41 - 14:46)
a lot of gems yes I don't think we're (14:44 - 14:48)
going to not stop talking about Pokemon (14:46 - 14:50)
masters in the foreseeable future since (14:48 - 14:53)
its kind of become this game that (14:50 - 14:54)
updates very frequently like Pokemon go (14:53 - 14:58)
but for for now if you are slight if you (14:54 - 15:01)
are ever ever so slightly interested in (14:58 - 15:04)
Pokemon masters the first three times (15:01 - 15:07)
you log in as of to 2020 sorry well as (15:04 - 15:11)
of this year you can get a thousand gems (15:07 - 15:12)
for the first three days which is three (15:11 - 15:16)
thousand gems which is ten pulls yep (15:12 - 15:18)
which is very generous and I don't know (15:16 - 15:20)
if it counts or if you had to log in on (15:18 - 15:22)
new year's day but then they gave a (15:20 - 15:27)
bonus 2020 gems on new year's day I (15:22 - 15:28)
don't know if that's still available I (15:27 - 15:30)
don't think it is but there there's like (15:28 - 15:33)
a 14-day event right now the first three (15:30 - 15:35)
days are a thousand gems it doesn't (15:33 - 15:36)
matter where in the 14 days you start (15:35 - 15:37)
logging in (15:36 - 15:39)
so again if you're slightly curious and (15:37 - 15:42)
masters 3000 gems a lot for free and you (15:39 - 15:44)
just log in you hit claim reward and (15:42 - 15:46)
then you can go and I did this for (15:44 - 15:47)
several months (15:46 - 15:50)
where they they've had you know 50 gems (15:47 - 15:52)
login 100 gems login you know you've (15:50 - 15:54)
logged in 14 days in a row at the end (15:52 - 15:56)
you get 2,000 gems they've done a lot of (15:54 - 15:57)
these over the last few months so I was (15:56 - 16:00)
able to save about 50,000 gems and I (15:57 - 16:02)
think what finally hooked me is I pulled (16:00 - 16:04)
characters I cared about and the one (16:02 - 16:06)
that like super stuck out for whatever (16:04 - 16:12)
reason is Eliza who is the gym leader in (16:06 - 16:14)
black and white black and white - she's (16:12 - 16:17)
the model fashion model and she's like (16:14 - 16:20)
gym leader yes and she has up strike a (16:17 - 16:23)
and it's the the thing that mug poke my (16:20 - 16:25)
masters are so well and what keeps me (16:23 - 16:28)
coming back will is like once you find a (16:25 - 16:31)
character that you can like hearing them (16:28 - 16:34)
talk seeing actual personality in them (16:31 - 16:36)
which is what masters is like top-tier (16:34 - 16:39)
right now it's just like the little bit (16:36 - 16:42)
of dialogue that prior to like main (16:39 - 16:43)
series Pokemon games being like should (16:42 - 16:45)
they have voice acting in main series (16:43 - 16:47)
Pokemon games I would I would in the (16:45 - 16:49)
past argue like no that's too much time (16:47 - 16:52)
and money they could use in other places (16:49 - 16:54)
it's very hard to localize a game in (16:52 - 16:56)
like 8 different languages especially (16:54 - 16:57)
because Pokemon games now ship worldwide (16:56 - 17:00)
there's a lot of dialogue in Pokemon (16:57 - 17:03)
games and I mean a small but very vocal (17:00 - 17:05)
amount of Pokemon fans already wanted to (17:03 - 17:08)
skip all the cutscenes anyway I don't (17:05 - 17:10)
think anyone even if somebody's never (17:08 - 17:12)
played Pokemon my thought process is who (17:10 - 17:14)
would run out who's like no I don't want (17:12 - 17:16)
a Pokemon game but oh if they added (17:14 - 17:18)
voice acting now I'm in like that's not (17:16 - 17:20)
probably a situation most people who (17:18 - 17:22)
have never touched the series like (17:20 - 17:24)
that's not their main complaint is the (17:22 - 17:25)
lack of voice acting so when I heard (17:24 - 17:27)
masters had like voice acting I was like (17:25 - 17:30)
what but it's not like full voice acting (17:27 - 17:32)
it's just like these little quips yeah (17:30 - 17:34)
but those little quips at so much (17:32 - 17:37)
character to it that otherwise it just (17:34 - 17:41)
go wow that attack was zeb striking no (17:37 - 17:45)
no when you when you pull a character (17:41 - 17:47)
for the first time like if you pull (17:45 - 17:51)
Wulfric or more Marlin or Agatha they (17:47 - 17:53)
will easily never pull Wulfric oh oh I (17:51 - 17:58)
get nonstic and Bugsy I got a lot of (17:53 - 18:01)
Candace's so like when you pull (17:58 - 18:03)
iliza she's like hi I'm Eliza and it's (18:01 - 18:05)
like oh I actually know how to say your (18:03 - 18:09)
name now and then she'll say like one (18:05 - 18:11)
thing about her and then when you're (18:09 - 18:12)
playing with her she'll just have like (18:11 - 18:14)
these little quips of like let's go or (18:12 - 18:18)
you can do this Zeb striking no I don't (18:14 - 18:20)
think she's that person though no and (18:18 - 18:22)
then we never will she's like how am (18:20 - 18:28)
Olga waiting no she did she did so this (18:22 - 18:31)
comes back to Cynthia where I think (18:28 - 18:34)
obviously DNA is not foolish they know (18:31 - 18:37)
they've done their research they know (18:34 - 18:41)
what trainers slash people the audience (18:37 - 18:43)
wants so like holding back Chris for a (18:41 - 18:46)
while holding back Cynthia holding back (18:43 - 18:49)
Lance is smart because people will hoard (18:46 - 18:52)
gems or save gems or in this case I'm (18:49 - 18:53)
sure with Cynthia people they probably (18:52 - 18:57)
saw an uptake in revenue because one not (18:53 - 19:00)
only do people love Cynthia but to (18:57 - 19:04)
Cynthia's is very very good yes in when (19:00 - 19:06)
there aren't any good grounds other than (19:04 - 19:08)
Cynthia like it was a much needed (19:06 - 19:10)
addition I will say a couple of things (19:08 - 19:14)
that they have done so they've mitigated (19:10 - 19:17)
how bad pols feel by letting you pull (19:14 - 19:19)
more often now so that you know when you (19:17 - 19:21)
get your eighth bugsy in the row it (19:19 - 19:23)
doesn't feel like where it did before I (19:21 - 19:25)
have to wait another month before I can (19:23 - 19:28)
pull again because gems are coming much (19:25 - 19:31)
more regularly so it's mitigated how bad (19:28 - 19:34)
summoning used to feel it still doesn't (19:31 - 19:38)
feel great but it's not as bad my other (19:34 - 19:40)
sort of major complaint with the game (19:38 - 19:43)
still is if you're a big Pokemon player (19:40 - 19:47)
they do not play by the same type rules (19:43 - 19:52)
so dark types are not immune to psychic (19:47 - 19:54)
they're you know things that should have (19:52 - 19:57)
double weaknesses only have the weakness (19:54 - 19:59)
that's listed above their head and no (19:57 - 20:02)
others so it's it's a bit frustrating (19:59 - 20:03)
when you're used to playing the other (20:02 - 20:06)
Pokemon games that masters works very (20:03 - 20:08)
differently so when you're planning (20:06 - 20:10)
something you're like why did that (20:08 - 20:14)
happen well you gotta get like the TCG (20:10 - 20:14)
where the (20:14 - 20:18)
grass bug poison right I'll be what (20:14 - 20:22)
energy yeah it's frustrating in that (20:18 - 20:24)
fact it doesn't you have to sort of put (20:22 - 20:27)
masters in its own category like it (20:24 - 20:31)
plays by its own rule now and what you (20:27 - 20:33)
think will work or won't work you have (20:31 - 20:36)
to learn the rules of masters which is a (20:33 - 20:40)
little frustrating it's it's like okay (20:36 - 20:42)
it was particularly frustrating during (20:40 - 20:44)
the me to events because you know you'd (20:42 - 20:45)
have everybody have a team of their dark (20:44 - 20:48)
Pokemon and it was like psychic one shot (20:45 - 20:53)
at it I'm like oh how yeah but pokemon (20:48 - 20:55)
go is the same yes where moose will (20:53 - 20:58)
still do damage when they shouldn't yeah (20:55 - 21:01)
it's just it's you know right when I'm (20:58 - 21:03)
playing the other game and I'm very deep (21:01 - 21:05)
into a great game switching to this (21:03 - 21:07)
where it plays by its own rules is just (21:05 - 21:11)
like all right I see you speaking of the (21:07 - 21:14)
TCG this is all Pokemon calm Pokemon TCG (21:11 - 21:16)

there's the score bunny sob old gookie (21:49 - 21:54)
boxes that are available but I don't (21:52 - 21:56)
think they come with well the all these (21:54 - 21:59)
packs are coming with older cards but if (21:56 - 22:01)
you wanted like a Saba card early like (21:59 - 22:03)
those exist but I don't think we're (22:01 - 22:05)
getting those aren't always bad oh yeah (22:03 - 22:09)
yeah I don't think we're getting Galler (22:05 - 22:11)
stuff until February I'm pretty sure (22:09 - 22:14)
it's February so it's soon it's soon (22:11 - 22:18)
what was it there was um when we were (22:14 - 22:19)
playing well I can't remember (22:18 - 22:21)
specifically what it what what starters (22:19 - 22:24)
there were boat it wasn't was it it was (22:21 - 22:25)
back in Gen 5 I want to say it was maybe (22:24 - 22:27)
like (22:25 - 22:29)
Saru uh where there was a specifically (22:27 - 22:31)
like I'm McDonald's as a rule but that (22:29 - 22:34)
was like slightly better than the others (22:31 - 22:36)
a true is like it had like 10 more HP I (22:34 - 22:38)
think was it zero or was it Dino (22:36 - 22:44)
ah I can't mmm here remember there was (22:38 - 22:46)
something though that like McDonald's (22:44 - 22:49)
would have TOI like Pokemon toys and (22:46 - 22:50)
they would always come with a Pokemon (22:49 - 22:52)
card but something in the McDonald's set (22:50 - 22:53)
had 10 more HP than what you would (22:52 - 22:56)
normally get in like another set and (22:53 - 22:57)
that's like pretty common where it's (22:56 - 22:59)
like there's three different Chikorita (22:57 - 23:01)
z' and one Chikorita has this move and (22:59 - 23:03)
another Chikorita has this move but they (23:01 - 23:05)
both have like one retreat and 60 HP but (23:03 - 23:07)
this mcdonald's Chikorita (23:05 - 23:12)
has worse but it has 70 HP which is good (23:07 - 23:14)
for cuz a lot of bench attacks will do (23:12 - 23:17)
30 so to 30s a 60 knock out but because (23:14 - 23:20)
it had 70 camera what it does anyways I (23:17 - 23:22)
am disturbed that there's actually (23:20 - 23:24)
something there is a rare it not a (23:22 - 23:28)
rarity coat a set code for McDonald's (23:24 - 23:31)
collection there are yes yeah yes (23:28 - 23:34)
they've been in the overall collection (23:31 - 23:39)
thing huh well I mean this is a zero (23:34 - 23:43)
with 50 HP and the McDonald's Collection (23:39 - 23:45)
card boy there are a lot of zero is (23:43 - 23:47)
printed oh you know speaking about weird (23:45 - 23:48)
collection stuff I forgot to bring this (23:47 - 23:51)
up on the show this is TCG related but (23:48 - 23:53)
back when detective Pikachu came out (23:51 - 23:57)
they did they did like exclusive cards (23:53 - 23:59)
at Game Stop and Target and Walmart I (23:57 - 24:01)
think were the three so like the day (23:59 - 24:04)
after detective Pikachu came out for (24:01 - 24:05)
that weekend you were you were like (24:04 - 24:06)
supposed to be able to go in the game (24:05 - 24:09)
stop and then ask for I think Game Stop (24:06 - 24:10)
had like snubbull and say like hey do (24:09 - 24:12)
you have the snubbull card and they gave (24:10 - 24:13)
it they gave me the snubbull card and (24:12 - 24:15)
then I think they had a poster and then (24:13 - 24:17)
it wasn't until like the following week (24:15 - 24:19)
they were available at Target and I (24:17 - 24:20)
think that was the same time the (24:19 - 24:23)
Bulbasaur like Funko pop came out and so (24:20 - 24:25)
when you went to Target they had I want (24:23 - 24:26)
to say like side duck and so these again (24:25 - 24:28)
I just like the McDonald's stuff they're (24:26 - 24:30)
like numbered cards and so of course me (24:28 - 24:31)
being a sucker (24:30 - 24:33)
I bought the giant bubbles her Funko pop (24:31 - 24:36)
I used my Pokemon pass and I scanned (24:33 - 24:39)
inside oh it was also when the shiny (24:36 - 24:41)
peek (24:39 - 24:43)
choo and shiny Eevee were available in (24:41 - 24:46)
Pokemon let's go and then I got my (24:43 - 24:48)
snuggle card and then it wasn't (24:46 - 24:50)
available in two like two weeks later (24:48 - 24:53)
that the Bulbasaur card was available at (24:50 - 24:56)
Walmart so I went to Walmart that (24:53 - 24:58)
weekend they had no clue what I'm (24:56 - 24:59)
talking about so I went to a different (24:58 - 25:02)
Walmart no clue what I'm talking about (24:59 - 25:04)
then we I went all the way out to (25:02 - 25:06)
Waukesha auctions not that far north all (25:04 - 25:09)
the way out to watch I GI had to drive (25:06 - 25:11)
all the way to eat in Prairie oh good (25:09 - 25:16)
gracious and they kind of knew what I (25:11 - 25:17)
was talking about but they were like we (25:16 - 25:21)
don't have any so I wrote the Pokemon (25:17 - 25:25)
company in email I went to support type (25:21 - 25:28)
Pokemon calm opened up a support ticket (25:25 - 25:29)
this was months ago this is one (25:28 - 25:31)
detective Pikachu came out and I said (25:29 - 25:35)
look I'm a little frustrated that you (25:31 - 25:36)
guys are working with Walmart not (25:35 - 25:39)
because specifically you're working with (25:36 - 25:42)
Walmart but specifically no one at (25:39 - 25:45)
Walmart knows these promotions that (25:42 - 25:47)
you're working with like I've been to (25:45 - 25:48)
many of Game Stop promotions (25:47 - 25:51)
you know since heartgold SoulSilver (25:48 - 25:53)
besides them wanting to try to sell me (25:51 - 25:56)
pre-orders Game Stop usually pretty good (25:53 - 25:59)
with Pokemon collaborations I don't (25:56 - 26:00)
think I've ever had like a dramatic (25:59 - 26:03)
issue their target kind of hit mess but (26:00 - 26:05)
nine times out of ten they know what (26:03 - 26:08)
you're talking about and or grab as many (26:05 - 26:09)
code cards as you want on the counter (26:08 - 26:12)
because we don't care yep we we know (26:09 - 26:15)
about it we just don't care and but (26:12 - 26:17)
Walmart had no clue what we were even (26:15 - 26:19)
talking about and so that's what I said (26:17 - 26:21)
in the email I didn't think anything of (26:19 - 26:24)
it and but they they actually got back (26:21 - 26:25)
to me and they said oh we're really (26:24 - 26:28)
sorry we will send you the Bulbasaur (26:25 - 26:30)
card you're missing and I don't know (26:28 - 26:31)
this Bulbasaur card was like three bucks (26:30 - 26:33)
and TCG player so I could've just went (26:31 - 26:37)
to TCG player and bought it yeah but you (26:33 - 26:39)
know I spent the time to go to three (26:37 - 26:41)
different Walmart's (26:39 - 26:43)
and if no one knew what I'm talking (26:41 - 26:47)
about I can't even imagine like how (26:43 - 26:48)
other people felt for the bubble sir (26:47 - 26:50)
because I can't be the only person in (26:48 - 26:52)
the Greater Milwaukee area walking into (26:50 - 26:54)
Walmart asking for a Bulbasaur card like (26:52 - 26:56)
somebody else had to have done this (26:54 - 26:57)
especially if you're going to the other (26:56 - 27:00)
stores and this was the hype of (26:57 - 27:02)
detective Pikachu they sent me two (27:00 - 27:05)
buzzer cards they actually like they (27:02 - 27:08)
sent me a form like a Google Form and (27:05 - 27:10)
they said fill this out so apparently (27:08 - 27:13)
I'm sure they got other emails so I felt (27:10 - 27:15)
up the Google Form and I they sent me (27:13 - 27:18)
two bulbasaur cards which there you go (27:15 - 27:19)
okay (27:18 - 27:21)
support da pokemon.com actually does (27:19 - 27:22)
stuff I guess (27:21 - 27:24)
well quality customer service is what (27:22 - 27:25)
they do and that's what they're known (27:24 - 27:25)

Happy New Year (29:56 - 29:59)
thanks so much I'm with the rest of the (29:57 - 30:07)
episode party with Worple during the (29:59 - 30:11)
adventure sync a hackathon I've got (30:07 - 30:12)
issues with this event (30:11 - 30:17)
do you love Pokemon go will do I love (30:12 - 30:19)
Pokemon go I play pokemon go every (30:17 - 30:21)
single day I'm popping lucky eggs left (30:19 - 30:25)
and right yeah do you love hatching eggs (30:21 - 30:28)
I used all of the special incubators (30:25 - 30:30)
they gave me as a free gift and I use (30:28 - 30:32)
the infinite incubator every single time (30:30 - 30:34)
in egg hatches I'm popping a new one up (30:32 - 30:39)
in there do you love wasted money well I (30:34 - 30:42)
mean I only use the free incubators so (30:39 - 30:50)
no leave it to me antic one listen to (30:42 - 30:53)
their community what a party had on (30:50 - 30:57)
Wurmple and then hide it behind eggs so (30:53 - 31:01)
but do people understand that Wurmple (30:57 - 31:03)
already looks like it's wearing a party (31:01 - 31:05)
hat yeah (31:03 - 31:08)
I know you're just like it's got a spike (31:05 - 31:10)
on top of its head that literally looks (31:08 - 31:14)
like a party hat just paint it you don't (31:10 - 31:16)
even need to go to the store and buy one (31:14 - 31:18)
just get some makeup and put some makeup (31:16 - 31:20)
put some spots on that thing and you got (31:18 - 31:22)
a party like everything in Pokemon I (31:20 - 31:26)
love hate relationship with with Pokemon (31:22 - 31:30)
go niet Tech has listened to the most (31:26 - 31:33)
vocal of fans you know the the gen (31:30 - 31:36)
winners as we call them very obsessed (31:33 - 31:39)
with their childhood and they wanted (31:36 - 31:41)
glasses on squirtle and then they (31:39 - 31:43)
complained that they weren't the right (31:41 - 31:45)
glasses well they weren't the right (31:43 - 31:49)
glasses look they all can't be that (31:45 - 31:52)
squirtle the JED winners who haven't (31:49 - 31:55)
watched a single anime this after maybe (31:52 - 31:57)
I'll give them credit they probably (31:55 - 31:59)
watched the orange islands they probably (31:57 - 32:00)
watched that filler season that was the (31:59 - 32:02)
orange islands but didn't watch a single (32:00 - 32:03)
episode be anime after the orange (32:02 - 32:06)
islands didn't go on the journey with (32:03 - 32:09)
ash and his Treecko who always had a (32:06 - 32:13)
straw in his mouth all the way up (32:09 - 32:14)
treacle (32:13 - 32:18)
Grovyle Sceptile that straw was always (32:14 - 32:22)
there no justice for Treecko there's (32:18 - 32:24)
probably other Pokemon that I could use (32:22 - 32:28)
as examples to know shiny Noctowl but (32:24 - 32:30)
never shine II knocked out for a long (32:28 - 32:31)
time (32:30 - 32:34)
justice for Treecko and then last year (32:31 - 32:38)
they they they did this loading screen (32:34 - 32:40)
and in the loading screen there was a (32:38 - 32:42)
Wurmple wearing a party hat (32:40 - 32:45)
and everyone lost their minds was it (32:42 - 32:47)
2018 or was a 2019 I think was last year (32:45 - 32:51)
in July Janek yeah and they delivered (32:47 - 32:55)
party hat Worple here but only in 2k (32:51 - 32:58)
eggs which to be I you know to be fair (32:55 - 33:00)
this is all this is the problem though (32:58 - 33:02)
2k eggs are fine cuz they're a lot (33:00 - 33:07)
easier to hatch but the game is designed (33:02 - 33:09)
and set up in a way this is this is why (33:07 - 33:15)
I hate to give you more 2k eggs but then (33:09 - 33:18)
you feel like the super incubator that (33:15 - 33:19)
you've purchased (33:18 - 33:22)
you're wasting it because that it like (33:19 - 33:25)
reduces the walk time by like 1/3 which (33:22 - 33:27)
you don't really need the reduction on (33:25 - 33:29)
that so like you're burning through that (33:27 - 33:33)
incubator faster unless a on two K eggs (33:29 - 33:35)
which are easier to hatch but you don't (33:33 - 33:37)
want to be a sucker and buy the other (33:35 - 33:39)
incubator because for 50 more coins you (33:37 - 33:41)
can get the better one this it's like a (33:39 - 33:45)
no-win situation well there's good slow (33:41 - 33:47)
pokemons go right there it's like a no (33:45 - 33:53)
twins you cannot buy them but then what (33:47 - 33:55)
if you don't get the Worple then you (33:53 - 33:56)
don't get the work well it will be back (33:55 - 33:59)
like everything a Pokemon go it will be (33:56 - 34:01)
back you'll get it eventually (33:59 - 34:04)
like if you are the fool that says I (34:01 - 34:07)
have to have this now then you are their (34:04 - 34:08)
demographic that they're making money (34:07 - 34:12)
off of I did not the picture is cute but (34:08 - 34:15)
again like okay it's a Wurmple with a (34:12 - 34:18)
hat on it and then I don't know which (34:15 - 34:20)
evolution I'm getting anyways and the (34:18 - 34:22)
only way I can evolve can evolve well (34:20 - 34:25)
then why because of what we're both okay (34:22 - 34:28)
with it I hate the like where every (34:25 - 34:29)
poker brat is somebody's favorite (34:28 - 34:33)
Pokemon I hate that because that true no (34:29 - 34:35)
one likes cascoon and no one likes (34:33 - 34:39)
silcoon no - I like them both they're (34:35 - 34:43)
awful but they'd be better with a party (34:39 - 34:46)
about yeah yes would be an improvement (34:43 - 34:49)
that would be a significant improvement (34:46 - 34:52)
all right checking for art for party hat (34:49 - 34:56)
silcoon nothing trainers ready those (34:52 - 34:59)
incubators I'm gonna change incubators (34:56 - 35:03)
to the word money ready those monies the (34:59 - 35:06)
adventure thought is back and it's the (35:03 - 35:08)
perfect time to get your leg up on your (35:06 - 35:10)
new year's resolution during the (35:08 - 35:13)

rewarded with extra Stardust rare (35:13 - 35:17)
candies and you nova stones if you walk (35:15 - 35:19)

have a chance of hatching Pichu wearing (35:37 - 35:43)

rare candy I got like 400 of those (36:33 - 36:38)
things they nerfed it they nerfed rare (36:35 - 36:40)
candy in like the last month so you get (36:38 - 36:43)
lesser candy now from raids oh not that (36:40 - 36:44)
it does something different I was like (36:43 - 36:46)
nerfing to me means it does something (36:44 - 36:47)
else I know (36:46 - 36:49)
does it not give the same amount yeah (36:47 - 36:52)
exactly things like this is not two (36:49 - 36:57)

patience is a virtue that should be (37:20 - 37:25)
their tagline yeah uh Heatran is coming (37:22 - 37:28)
back speaking of heat ran high heat ran (37:25 - 37:30)
actually let's share a sentimental (37:28 - 37:31)
moment here boys (37:30 - 37:34)
actually heat ran actually is not a (37:31 - 37:38)
cockroach okay we're having him in the (37:34 - 37:40)
moment what are we sentimentally we all (37:38 - 37:42)
got heat ran right before my wedding (37:40 - 37:45)
together we did me so y'all went to the (37:42 - 37:46)
wrong Denny's (37:45 - 37:48)

don't remember any Denny's oh I do (37:48 - 37:57)
remember you do yeah yes that actually (37:50 - 38:00)
that day of driving around Wisconsin (37:57 - 38:05)
from heat travels kind of fun it was we (38:00 - 38:08)
couldn't find like half the roads at the (38:05 - 38:11)
time cuz there's a lake in the way for (38:08 - 38:13)
for our listeners I got married last (38:11 - 38:15)
year celebrated my one-year anniversary (38:13 - 38:19)
for my bachelor's party will who was in (38:15 - 38:23)
charge of it booked like a house a cabin (38:19 - 38:25)
I don't know what to call Abbott cabin (38:23 - 38:28)
cabin out in the Wisconsin Dells so we (38:25 - 38:30)
were out there for three or four days (38:28 - 38:32)
and it was the weekend where Heatran was (38:30 - 38:34)
promoted so I'm one of the days I think (38:32 - 38:38)
it was maybe Sunday we drove we happened (38:34 - 38:40)
to see a heat ran and there was I think (38:38 - 38:42)
eight of us yeah we took two cars drove (38:40 - 38:44)
to the Heatran (38:42 - 38:46)
Tran because we were in the middle of (38:44 - 38:49)
nowhere because most hotels are also (38:46 - 38:54)
gyms and there's a lot of statues (38:49 - 38:56)
historical things in the Wisconsin Dells (38:54 - 38:57)
there's a lot of gyms but they're just (38:56 - 38:59)
spread out there on all these windy (38:57 - 39:01)
roads that you have to like drive (38:59 - 39:03)
underneath the hotel over this mountain (39:01 - 39:04)
through this tree and then you'll get to (39:03 - 39:06)
the spot there happened to be another (39:04 - 39:08)
heat transfer drove to that one and then (39:06 - 39:09)
there happened to be another heat ransom (39:08 - 39:11)
that one and a certain point we were (39:09 - 39:13)
like why are we doing like we already (39:11 - 39:14)
got one (39:13 - 39:18)
he trans not good but what we should do (39:14 - 39:20)
now is we should all book the Wisconsin (39:18 - 39:21)
Dells last minute now we should go get (39:20 - 39:24)
China he trained I mean it is less (39:21 - 39:27)
expensive in the winter that's right (39:24 - 39:30)
bring board games and I love playing (39:27 - 39:32)
board games yes we had a lot of good (39:30 - 39:33)
board game (39:32 - 39:35)
I'm that weekend too it's true I brought (39:33 - 39:37)
I brought all the good ones I brought (39:35 - 39:39)
one good one he did but it lasted for (39:37 - 39:42)
hours he's a mica (39:39 - 39:45)
[Music] (39:42 - 39:45)
okay so here's my question about this (39:47 - 39:51)
party party hat fiasco (39:48 - 39:54)
yes we've said on the show multiple (39:51 - 39:56)
times and I I think some of the pokemon (39:54 - 39:59)
go audience has finally started (39:56 - 40:02)
realizing this but we've always said (39:59 - 40:04)
this Chinese are not new content yep or (40:02 - 40:06)
air but knee antic treats them as new (40:04 - 40:08)
content yep oh you got to get out this (40:06 - 40:11)
week you can get shiny whoo dude like (40:08 - 40:12)
you gotta go (40:11 - 40:15)
they're all just shiny who do now I will (40:12 - 40:17)
I will say like Redick aid with a party (40:15 - 40:20)
hat Wobbuffet with a party hat that's (40:17 - 40:22)
new content that's another thing to add (40:20 - 40:22)
to your collection (40:22 - 40:24)
another dex entry whether or not you (40:22 - 40:26)
want the shiny I mean that depends on (40:24 - 40:28)
how much money you want to spend because (40:26 - 40:30)
those are those two are raids only but (40:28 - 40:32)
they've done this before (40:30 - 40:33)
and I don't think we've really talked (40:32 - 40:34)
about it but these specifically the (40:33 - 40:38)
adventurous ink reward is pretty good so (40:34 - 40:40)
for 50 kilometers which I rarely ever (40:38 - 40:44)
hit because I work at home unfortunately (40:40 - 40:46)
also a blessing and a curse but here (40:44 - 40:51)
doesn't work at home Greg me oh wow your (40:46 - 40:51)
loss (40:51 - 40:56)
but you get 50 I mean I could 50k start (40:51 - 40:59)
us pretty good 15 where candy guaranteed (40:56 - 41:00)
you Nova stone the thing that people are (40:59 - 41:03)
after the most so if we ignore the (41:00 - 41:07)
adding shine eases new content they're (41:03 - 41:09)
really focusing on you hatching eggs (41:07 - 41:11)
giving you a lot of 2k eggs which you (41:09 - 41:13)
can do with your free incubator if they (41:11 - 41:14)
want you to spend the money for the (41:13 - 41:19)
other eggs which that's up to you but is (41:14 - 41:22)
the adventure sync reward good enough is (41:19 - 41:25)
that like oh I can get this two weeks in (41:22 - 41:29)
a row if I walk a lot does but I guess (41:25 - 41:31)
the question is like does that make (41:29 - 41:33)
somebody who never hits the 50k (41:31 - 41:37)
dedicated to hit that 50k to get those (41:33 - 41:41)
three rewards oh it's not no no nobody's (41:37 - 41:42)
gonna go out of their way the 50k that's (41:41 - 41:45)
a lot of walking now that is a lot of (41:42 - 41:51)
walking I'm at 21 this week so in hours (41:45 - 41:54)
I just got to double that yeah just go (41:51 - 41:56)
running around a mall somewhere for a (41:54 - 41:58)
while that's a lot of it's a lot of (41:56 - 42:00)
walking I feel like (41:58 - 42:04)
they could do at least give like a 25k (42:00 - 42:06)
reward oh hey I walked sixty six point (42:04 - 42:10)
eight kilometers this week what did you (42:06 - 42:15)
go i well not usually on Saturdays I (42:10 - 42:17)
take a six or seven mile walk which I (42:15 - 42:23)
did yesterday miles to kilometers what's (42:17 - 42:26)
what's 50k in miles well a 10k is six (42:23 - 42:29)
miles so it'd be about thirty miles (42:26 - 42:31)
geez that's a lot of walking but yeah I (42:29 - 42:33)
also went to Norway house and the (42:31 - 42:38)
Americans so you're getting your get a (42:33 - 42:40)
number of times what's here once you (42:38 - 42:42)
start uh scout out where right now well (42:40 - 42:44)
where do I cease my star disk I use (42:42 - 42:46)
clearly any Pokemon that you've caught (42:44 - 42:48)
him on there's Pokemon in this game to (42:46 - 42:51)
be exact 50 K is thirty one point zero (42:48 - 42:55)
six eight six miles I have two million (42:51 - 42:57)
nine hundred and thirty two thousand (42:55 - 42:58)
three hundred and eighty eight Stardust (42:57 - 43:01)
so 50k is a drop in the bucket and (42:58 - 43:03)
what's even more astounding to me is I (43:01 - 43:06)
have 1619 EB candy what am I doing with (43:03 - 43:09)
halt oh and how many you Nova stones do (43:06 - 43:10)
you have well you bought the $10 (43:09 - 43:12)
Reggie things so you got one you know if (43:10 - 43:14)
it's done from that how do I find out (43:12 - 43:15)
how many you know put stones I have is (43:14 - 43:17)
it alright that's a new bread probably (43:15 - 43:19)
can go bottom none to right now I think (43:17 - 43:22)
I got one from the research and then I (43:19 - 43:25)
got the I had three total because I used (43:22 - 43:26)
one to evolve Chandeleur so I have two (43:25 - 43:29)
extra now I have one you Nova stone so (43:26 - 43:30)
you're getting another one this week (43:29 - 43:33)
there's pretty great yay (43:30 - 43:33)
yeah I think adventures think needs (43:35 - 43:39)
needs to go up or they need to do (43:37 - 43:42)
something more because if they want (43:39 - 43:43)
actual people like if they want me to (43:42 - 43:48)
get out of my house 50 kids a lot I mean (43:43 - 43:50)
I think the rewards are good but I feel (43:48 - 43:52)
like there should be a reward at 25k - (43:50 - 43:54)
not as good maybe not the guaranteed you (43:52 - 43:56)
know the stone but something I mean (43:54 - 43:58)
there is a reward it's just a reward (43:56 - 44:01)
yeah it's like it's like what 25 (43:58 - 44:03)
pokeballs and like five Great Falls for (44:01 - 44:06)
25k it's not that great Wow that's you (44:03 - 44:08)
know it lets your pokeball pause it's (44:06 - 44:11)
your choice if you walk in 25k you (44:08 - 44:14)
probably don't need the 30 pokeballs (44:11 - 44:16)
popping out you're already you're (44:14 - 44:18)
already pretty dedicated to the game if (44:16 - 44:21)
you're recording 25k being of bragging (44:18 - 44:24)

have been tempted to play the game (49:07 - 49:11)

puzzle game wrapping around two one (50:53 - 50:58)
point five billion dollars I gave up on (50:55 - 51:01)
that game long ago how is that still (50:58 - 51:03)
going so strong because you get to match (51:01 - 51:05)
three things probably because they have (51:03 - 51:08)

addicted to candy crush oh I was - I was (51:16 - 51:21)
- and then I got to a level where it's (51:19 - 51:22)
just like there was nothing I could do (51:21 - 51:23)
without paying money and I was like I'm (51:22 - 51:25)
out and it was like level 1,500 or (51:23 - 51:28)
something my friend and plays still and (51:25 - 51:30)
rents the same thing but takes like time (51:28 - 51:32)

bit and game comeback number for me I (51:34 - 51:41)

Angry Birds league of legends by Riot (51:41 - 51:50)
Games slash ten cent is a MOBA 1.5 (51:45 - 51:54)
billion dollars that makes sense now I'm (51:50 - 51:57)
feeling like garden escapes isn't gonna (51:54 - 51:59)
be on this list at all (51:57 - 52:04)
number three honor of kings by 10 cent (51:59 - 52:09)
also a MOBA 1.6 billion dollars the (52:04 - 52:12)
third time 10 cent is on this list ok (52:09 - 52:15)
number two is dungeon fighter online by (52:12 - 52:18)
Nexon RPG one point six billion dollars (52:15 - 52:21)
and I'm curious about this one is this (52:18 - 52:23)
in my mobile phone dungeon Fighter (52:21 - 52:27)
online as Greg look that up number one (52:23 - 52:31)
for night by epic games it's a shooter (52:27 - 52:36)
that's made 1.8 billion dollars sounds (52:31 - 52:38)
about right yep no dungeon fighter (52:36 - 52:41)
online on my phone so it has to be (52:38 - 52:43)
free-to-play somewhere else Pokemon go (52:41 - 52:45)
really uh (52:43 - 52:45)
falling behind Hey Oh Jenna fighter (52:46 - 52:53)
online is on steam i don't know one so i (52:49 - 52:55)
mean there's a lot of money between one (52:53 - 52:59)
point or in 1.8 billion man that's where (52:55 - 53:01)
forward i being the biggest game in the (52:59 - 53:05)
world and pokemon go to be like slightly (53:01 - 53:09)
below it is still super impressive that (53:05 - 53:11)
mean there's 400 million between it (53:09 - 53:13)
that's how much money there is real big (53:11 - 53:16)
whales in the pokemon go see well i (53:13 - 53:17)
think the thing that's holding pokemon (53:16 - 53:20)
go back is the fact that it's mobile (53:17 - 53:23)
only and we're getting to a point where (53:20 - 53:25)
there is more saturation of mobile (53:23 - 53:29)
phones around yes but we're also getting (53:25 - 53:32)
to a point where the free mobile phones (53:29 - 53:34)
the technology on them is not good (53:32 - 53:37)
enough to run the high-end mobile games (53:34 - 53:40)
any longer so then people are going (53:37 - 53:42)
moving over to steam which is on their (53:40 - 53:44)
pc and they have actually it's a little (53:42 - 53:46)
more affordable to keep your pc up to (53:44 - 53:48)
date with better equipment than it is to (53:46 - 53:50)
keep upgrading your phone which you (53:48 - 53:53)
can't upgrade parts of every year mm-hmm (53:50 - 53:55)
so that's you know the money is shifting (53:53 - 53:57)
away from the mobile phone market and (53:55 - 54:00)
into things like steam and pc gaming (53:57 - 54:02)
where there's it's it's actually (54:00 - 54:04)
becoming more accessible to the (54:02 - 54:06)
marketplace that's your economics talk (54:04 - 54:10)
from william our anderson bongo can't (54:06 - 54:11)
ever get that market because it requires (54:10 - 54:16)
you to be outside yeah well not only (54:11 - 54:18)
that but when your phone gets so old (54:16 - 54:20)
that it's like clunky and I mean Pokemon (54:18 - 54:22)
go has enough technology problems (54:20 - 54:26)
running on a really good phone but yeah (54:22 - 54:28)
well I mean this is just one out of (54:26 - 54:30)
millions of people but my sister is a (54:28 - 54:33)
prime example of that where she stopped (54:30 - 54:35)
playing pokemon go purely because her (54:33 - 54:38)
phone had troubles running it and she (54:35 - 54:40)
was the person that played you know (54:38 - 54:42)
every day and that went from every day (54:40 - 54:44)
to like once a week (54:42 - 54:46)
because i mean according to her words it (54:44 - 54:49)
was just it just doesn't work when she (54:46 - 54:52)
opens it well i mean i i have an iphone (54:49 - 54:54)
i don't know if i'm allowed to call it (54:52 - 54:56)
tan or x or whatever but the first that (54:54 - 54:59)
the one of that series i folks out i (54:56 - 55:00)
phone 10 (54:59 - 55:06)
and right now in this year 20 that we (55:00 - 55:11)
are in if I launched Pokemon go and in (55:06 - 55:13)
announcement that an egg is hatching (55:11 - 55:16)
happens immediately after the launch (55:13 - 55:18)
sequence the game freezes completely and (55:16 - 55:20)
I have to like force quit it and start (55:18 - 55:21)
it over again (55:20 - 55:24)
really I mean look they didn't make that (55:21 - 55:26)
much money this year (55:24 - 55:29)
yes they can't keep it updated who can't (55:26 - 55:32)
make socks can't update the game I mean (55:29 - 55:35)
I feel that there's a couple of things (55:32 - 55:37)
Pokemon go does require a better phone (55:35 - 55:40)
but doesn't require a great phone so (55:37 - 55:41)
there are a lot of options out there but (55:40 - 55:44)
I think one thing that limits them a (55:41 - 55:47)
little bit is they are held back by a (55:44 - 55:50)
larger company like when you're looking (55:47 - 55:51)
at something like fortnight port day is (55:50 - 55:54)
just responsible to themselves they can (55:51 - 55:55)
make whatever they want whenever they (55:54 - 55:59)
want Pokemon go does have a level of (55:55 - 56:02)
oversight and release schedules and (55:59 - 56:04)
stuff that they have to go through (56:02 - 56:06)
because they're working with a brand (56:04 - 56:10)
that isn't theirs so I think some of (56:06 - 56:12)
their growth is limited by the fact that (56:10 - 56:15)
they have to carefully consider a brand (56:12 - 56:20)
that they don't own and respond to those (56:15 - 56:23)
people's needs so there is a level of (56:20 - 56:26)
extra red tape for any sort of massive (56:23 - 56:28)
improvements or changes that they want (56:26 - 56:31)
to do whereas other mobile games can be (56:28 - 56:34)
much more agile in how they switch (56:31 - 56:36)
things around and I think that is a (56:34 - 56:39)
limiting factor as to how much money you (56:36 - 56:41)
can make if people get frustrated with (56:39 - 56:44)
like this is the game play and we're (56:41 - 56:45)
frustrated by it or we're frustrated by (56:44 - 56:48)
what you're presenting to us they have (56:45 - 56:50)
to respond to a larger parent company (56:48 - 56:53)
whereas other people don't I would (56:50 - 56:56)
personally put more money into Pokemon (56:53 - 56:59)
go in the in the places that doesn't (56:56 - 57:02)
feel like I'm getting ripped off so I (56:59 - 57:05)
don't like I don't mind buying storage (57:02 - 57:07)
upgrades even though I think it's kind (57:05 - 57:10)
of expensive like 2 bucks 450 so I've (57:07 - 57:11)
maxed out my storage I've maxed out my (57:10 - 57:13)
bag space because that is something that (57:11 - 57:14)
never goes away so I feel like there's (57:13 - 57:16)
value to that that is something I (57:14 - 57:17)
benefit from every day I play the game (57:16 - 57:20)
and plus I'm a hoarder but for me it's (57:17 - 57:21)
hard to put money in like incubators (57:20 - 57:24)
because they're gone and if I don't (57:21 - 57:25)
hatch what I intended that and so if I (57:24 - 57:28)
like bought you know a $2.00 incubator (57:25 - 57:30)
and I hatch three eggs and none of them (57:28 - 57:32)
were Wurmple I would be like well I (57:30 - 57:34)
don't feel like I got my money's worth (57:32 - 57:36)
because I hatched a soul Rock a soul (57:34 - 57:39)
rock and a Bulbasaur and that didn't (57:36 - 57:40)
feel like $2 worth sum (57:39 - 57:42)
so I personally stay away from that kind (57:40 - 57:44)
of stuff but like right now my big (57:42 - 57:46)
problem is I would like my trainer to (57:44 - 57:49)
look cool and I would like to purchase (57:46 - 57:51)
clothes I have no problem in games I (57:49 - 57:53)
like to purchase cosmetics because (57:51 - 57:55)
they're there and I can show them off (57:53 - 57:58)
and this new shirt makes me feel good (57:55 - 58:01)
inside and so here's your two dollars (57:58 - 58:03)
but the fact that this games made (58:01 - 58:06)
billions of billions of dollars in the (58:03 - 58:09)
last three years and if I put the $2 (58:06 - 58:12)
shirt on top of the one dollar and fifty (58:09 - 58:14)
cent pants and the belt buckle goes (58:12 - 58:18)
through the shirt it looks completely (58:14 - 58:20)
awful it's like what did I just pay for (58:18 - 58:23)
I just paid almost $4 for clothing items (58:20 - 58:25)
that look atrocious on my character (58:23 - 58:29)
without like what am I actually paying (58:25 - 58:31)
for here like that a real problem paying (58:29 - 58:33)
for clothing and stuff I don't see if (58:31 - 58:35)
you're sure because you feel good on the (58:33 - 58:37)
inside you're wearing it the wrong way a (58:35 - 58:38)
shirt supposed to make you feel good on (58:37 - 58:39)
the outs oh my bad (58:38 - 58:44)
yes quit eating your shirt Steve my big (58:39 - 58:48)
problem with specifically Pokemon go is (58:44 - 58:50)
I feel like the money I am putting into (58:48 - 58:53)
it is just like if you're gonna charge (58:50 - 58:55)
somebody two dollars for a shirt at (58:53 - 58:57)
least make it look good on the character (58:55 - 59:00)
you have one model yeah you have well (58:57 - 59:01)
you don't have different body types you (59:00 - 59:04)
don't have different heights yep why is (59:01 - 59:06)
the clothing in this game clipping each (59:04 - 59:09)
other so badly like the Pokemon (59:06 - 59:12)
themselves look great and I get that (59:09 - 59:13)
knee antic doesn't make the Pokemon (59:12 - 59:16)
models but you can't hire a base them (59:13 - 59:18)
you can't hire somebody to like really (59:16 - 59:21)
sit down and I'm sure they would (59:18 - 59:22)
probably maybe that maybe it maybe I'm (59:21 - 59:24)
wrong maybe it doesn't matter how good (59:22 - 59:26)
clothes the clothes look somebody sees (59:24 - 59:28)
that liket Tong shirt they pay the the (59:26 - 59:31)
two bucks for it they put it on it clips (59:28 - 59:33)
through the pants and they go well I (59:31 - 59:34)
already spent the two bucks who cares (59:33 - 59:36)
yep maybe maybe that's actually the core (59:34 - 59:39)
of this but if I know it's not gonna (59:36 - 59:41)
look good then why am i personally why (59:39 - 59:43)
would I pay the two dollars like I (59:41 - 59:45)
really I would I would probably buy all (59:43 - 59:48)
the clothes in the game at some point (59:45 - 59:51)
over at the time maybe buy one shirt a (59:48 - 59:53)
month and eventually catch up and have (59:51 - 59:54)
all the shirts (59:53 - 59:56)
half of them don't even look good oh my (59:54 - 59:58)
gosh it's so frustrating yeah that's (59:56 - 60:00)
true I don't even wear shoes in the game (59:58 - 60:02)
haven't worn them for years and I think (60:00 - 60:04)
my problem is it's just it's a game I (60:02 - 60:07)
play every day whether it's five minutes (60:04 - 60:10)
or an hour and so I've already invested (60:07 - 60:14)
the time so like two dollars in you know (60:10 - 60:16)
300 hours of playing a game I like to (60:14 - 60:20)
play is is really nothing but I feel (60:16 - 60:22)
like there's just such a big disrespect (60:20 - 60:25)
to the player for them to spend money on (60:22 - 60:26)
your clothes and your clothes don't even (60:25 - 60:28)
look good after you you gave me antique (60:26 - 60:32)
the money to look good maybe write a (60:28 - 60:34)
letter to support at Niantic comm so (60:32 - 60:35)
that they can (60:34 - 60:38)
yeah I'm sure I'm free clothes sure (60:35 - 60:40)
they'll answer it in two years all right (60:38 - 60:42)

month of January and check back later (62:28 - 62:34)
for more ranked battle season news so if (62:31 - 62:36)
you were to do the ranked the first (62:34 - 62:37)
ranked battles which took place in (62:36 - 62:39)
December and you were to make it to (62:37 - 62:41)
master ranked it doesn't matter where in (62:39 - 62:43)
master rank you make it you would have (62:41 - 62:47)
gotten 600 battle points and 3 golden (62:43 - 62:50)
bottle caps Wow which I think for me (62:47 - 62:53)
took its a tie I mean it's a time (62:50 - 62:56)
commitment for me it took I want to say (62:53 - 62:59)
about 50 battles to do I think it was (62:56 - 63:01)
like no it would might have been 60 (62:59 - 63:04)
because it was like 35 wins and 25 (63:01 - 63:07)
losses I think is what I ended up with (63:04 - 63:11)
to get to master ring how's it going now (63:07 - 63:11)
102 wins 8 losses I think right now you (63:12 - 63:17)
can you can definitely tell there was a (63:16 - 63:20)
slight shift in meta (63:17 - 63:23)
but I'm also very very bad at battling (63:20 - 63:25)
so I was pretty proud I made its master (63:23 - 63:27)
rank but 600 battle points is very very (63:25 - 63:30)
very very good I was not expecting the (63:27 - 63:31)
three golden bottle caps which is nice (63:30 - 63:34)
they're they're really pushing the (63:31 - 63:37)
competitive it's almost like at e3 they (63:34 - 63:38)
said that they wanted to focus more on (63:37 - 63:41)
competitive and that was one of the (63:38 - 63:43)
reasons for the national dex cut and (63:41 - 63:45)
here we are where almost everyone (63:43 - 63:47)
playing competitive is extremely happy (63:45 - 63:49)
with competitive unless your name is (63:47 - 63:55)
smoked ahead I don't know about nugget (63:49 - 63:56)
bridge but I mean like smoke smoke guns (63:55 - 63:58)
always like smoke gun was never gonna be (63:56 - 64:00)
happy with this because Mogan is (63:58 - 64:03)
designed to make sure everything is as (64:00 - 64:04)
fair as possible (64:03 - 64:07)
yes whereas like the Pokemon company (64:04 - 64:09)
they understand that that doesn't exist (64:07 - 64:11)
yeah yeah exactly (64:09 - 64:13)
and some point I mean if they cared that (64:11 - 64:15)
if they cared everything was fair as (64:13 - 64:17)
possible they wouldn't make Pokemon like (64:15 - 64:20)
far fetch or Chimecho or eglee buff (64:17 - 64:22)
right like these Pokemon will never ever (64:20 - 64:25)
be competitive well I don't know (64:22 - 64:27)
actually I'd but maybe somebody has made (64:25 - 64:29)
Chimecho competitive the Pokemon company (64:27 - 64:31)
wanted things to be as fair as possible (64:29 - 64:34)
they wouldn't have let Landorus run wild (64:31 - 64:39)
for ten years I don't have a ban the (64:34 - 64:40)
gene they don't exist they didn't make (64:39 - 64:42)
it over they didn't get their passport (64:40 - 64:45)
stamp now they've been cancelled yeah I (64:42 - 64:47)
don't know if I have much to say about (64:45 - 64:49)
the competitive stuff I know if you at (64:47 - 64:50)
least participate in one battle in (64:49 - 64:53)
ranked you get 50 battle points whether (64:50 - 64:55)
you win or lose if you want an easy 50 (64:53 - 64:57)
battle points actually a hundred battle (64:55 - 65:01)
points you do one round of ranked one (64:57 - 65:03)
round of sorry one round of ranked (65:01 - 65:05)
doubles one round of ranked singles and (65:03 - 65:08)
then at the end of the season you will (65:05 - 65:10)
get a hundred battle points just for (65:08 - 65:12)
participating in both I am NOT a huge (65:10 - 65:15)
fan of singles personally so I didn't do (65:12 - 65:17)
any singles but I guess in retrospect I (65:15 - 65:18)
probably should have done one match but (65:17 - 65:20)
yeah 600 battle points for getting a (65:18 - 65:23)
master rank pretty good I don't know if (65:20 - 65:24)
that's you know good enough for you guys (65:23 - 65:28)
to participate I know will has will have (65:24 - 65:31)
you beaten the game yet no no I told you (65:28 - 65:32)
I (65:31 - 65:36)
picked it up I was all ready to get back (65:32 - 65:40)
into it and play it through and finish (65:36 - 65:41)
the game especially after my nephew (65:40 - 65:43)
shamed me because my nephews already (65:41 - 65:45)
defeated the game and he was doing (65:43 - 65:47)
battle tower or something I ain't never (65:45 - 65:50)
heard of and I went and I was stepped (65:47 - 65:52)
out onto Route 9 and there was a little (65:50 - 65:54)
I was on the bridge and there was a (65:52 - 65:56)
little bubbly fish the whole thing and I (65:54 - 65:58)
was like well let me fish for something (65:56 - 66:00)
cool and new and I fished and I fished (65:58 - 66:03)
and I fished and the exclamation point (66:00 - 66:05)
came up and out popped in octillery and (66:03 - 66:08)
I said you know what that's why I don't (66:05 - 66:10)
want to play this game and they killed (66:08 - 66:12)
the octillery it walked back to the (66:10 - 66:14)
Pokemon Center and shame and put the (66:12 - 66:18)

Morini is not supposed to be walking (67:04 - 67:07)

very limited time the Magikarp you will (70:02 - 70:06)

being shiny don't miss your opportunity (70:08 - 70:12)
to battle and catch the special Pokemon (70:10 - 70:14)
to take advantage of these better odds (70:12 - 70:16)
and max raid battles you will need to (70:14 - 70:18)
connect to your Nintendo switch system (70:16 - 70:20)
to the internet then you will see a (70:18 - 70:23)
pillar of light shining from a Pokemon (70:20 - 70:25)

you know what friends it's the shiny (70:58 - 71:03)
Magikarp event let's go find some shiny (71:00 - 71:05)
Magikarp because that's a fun thing that (71:03 - 71:09)
we as friends can do together so I hop (71:05 - 71:11)
on I have my switch connected to my big (71:09 - 71:13)
old TV that Steve forced me to buy that (71:11 - 71:15)
cost a million dollars (71:13 - 71:17)
sure ultra-high resolution that just (71:15 - 71:19)
makes Pokemon look really really bad (71:17 - 71:23)
when you ultra shiny TV ultra yep and I (71:19 - 71:26)
like literally the first den that I went (71:23 - 71:29)
to was a Magikarp den and I was like (71:26 - 71:32)
okay friends join me look we'll do local (71:29 - 71:35)
play because neither one of you are (71:32 - 71:38)
subscribers to Nintendo online service (71:35 - 71:40)
this is an this is my boy to me but okay (71:38 - 71:44)
continue and they they started up the (71:40 - 71:45)
game (71:44 - 71:47)
and they're there we're all looking (71:45 - 71:50)
we're on our why menu and it's like well (71:47 - 71:52)
where's the stamp will there's no stamp (71:50 - 71:55)
we can't see the raid and like we tried (71:52 - 71:57)
it and tried it and I'm texting you and (71:55 - 71:59)
Greg and tried it and then like my (71:57 - 72:02)
Trevor started up a den battle and like (71:59 - 72:04)
we all saw that stamp come up we joined (72:02 - 72:07)
in I got a what says spinning dude (72:04 - 72:11)
hitmontop and like Tiffany started up a (72:07 - 72:13)
max raid battle and we all were able but (72:11 - 72:15)
like whenever I tried to do the Magikarp (72:13 - 72:18)
nobody could do it well why because (72:15 - 72:20)
since they're not Nintendo online (72:18 - 72:22)
subscribers they can't see it at all (72:20 - 72:24)
even though I could see it and they were (72:22 - 72:27)
literally in my house with me why (72:24 - 72:28)
couldn't there have been a message up on (72:27 - 72:30)
the screen that said you guys can't join (72:28 - 72:33)
this raid battle rather than me wasting (72:30 - 72:34)
45 minutes of my life (72:33 - 72:36)
not knowing that was the reason why they (72:34 - 72:37)
couldn't see it (72:36 - 72:40)
like one error message error messages (72:37 - 72:41)
like the most popular thing for computer (72:40 - 72:43)
programmers to program they love making (72:41 - 72:45)
error messages all I had to be was like (72:43 - 72:48)
your friends can't join sorry (72:45 - 72:50)
rather than me like having to text you (72:48 - 72:52)
and Greg like and then like two hours (72:50 - 72:54)
later find oh that's the reason why we (72:52 - 72:57)
couldn't see it I don't necessarily (72:54 - 73:03)
think you need Nintendo online or the (72:57 - 73:06)
Magikarp to appear but you do need (73:03 - 73:09)
Nintendo online to play with other (73:06 - 73:13)
people online I think in your instance (73:09 - 73:17)
we were doing local local but they never (73:13 - 73:20)
connected to Nintendo online to then (73:17 - 73:24)
tell the server that these are special (73:20 - 73:27)
raids yeah so the way they would have (73:24 - 73:30)
been able to connect a Nintendo online (73:27 - 73:33)
to get that server push because this is (73:30 - 73:35)
the we're going to talk about the the (73:33 - 73:37)
interesting thing here they would have (73:35 - 73:40)
had to either like update and share (73:37 - 73:43)
their trainer card or even more sent or (73:40 - 73:48)
or go into vs. or even more simply like (73:43 - 73:51)
just go into the wild area news on her (73:48 - 73:53)
mystery gift and by connecting the wild (73:51 - 73:55)
area news it would have pushed the (73:53 - 73:58)
server update even without Nintendo (73:55 - 73:59)
Online correct (73:58 - 74:03)
well I wish I had known that so I think (73:59 - 74:04)
that is the the problem because (74:03 - 74:07)
specifically in the the Pokemon article (74:04 - 74:08)
it doesn't say you need an attendant (74:07 - 74:10)
online but it says to take advantage of (74:08 - 74:11)
these raids you need to connect your (74:10 - 74:13)
Nintendo online system to the internet (74:11 - 74:15)
so by going to mystery gift and then (74:13 - 74:17)
going to wild area news that does (74:15 - 74:19)
temporarily connect you to the Internet (74:17 - 74:21)
which i think is what they needed to do (74:19 - 74:24)
I don't think they specifically needed (74:21 - 74:27)
Nintendo online but also like I said (74:24 - 74:28)
another way you could do that is by like (74:27 - 74:30)
updating your trainer card and then (74:28 - 74:32)
hitting with share button I think that (74:30 - 74:34)
connects you but okay so before we get (74:32 - 74:37)
to the Magikarp stuff it is I feel like (74:34 - 74:40)
if you're committing to a Pokemon game (74:37 - 74:44)
and I I don't know any of everyone I (74:40 - 74:47)
look as a twitch streamer I I could (74:44 - 74:48)
definitely relate to the people's (74:47 - 74:51)
wallets and how sometimes money is tight (74:48 - 74:53)
but I feel like if you're going all-in (74:51 - 74:54)
on a Pokemon game (74:53 - 74:56)
I feel like Nintendo online it's just (74:54 - 74:58)
part of that that that journey you're (74:56 - 75:01)
doing together these folks that aren't (74:58 - 75:03)
going all-in that's that's the thing (75:01 - 75:05)
they only were playing Pokemon because I (75:03 - 75:07)
was playing Pokemon if I hadn't said (75:05 - 75:08)
let's do raid battles together they (75:07 - 75:10)
wouldn't be playing Pokemon did they buy (75:08 - 75:14)
the games themselves yep they played (75:10 - 75:16)
through finish the game and done okay I (75:14 - 75:20)
mean yeah I guess those exist like I (75:16 - 75:21)
just think of it like I just think of (75:20 - 75:25)
like you just think of it like I mean (75:21 - 75:28)
back in the day like yeah it's I guess (75:25 - 75:30)
it sucks that like you have to pay $25 a (75:28 - 75:33)
year but also when you're buying a 16-5 (75:30 - 75:36)
I had like $25 a years I realize it but (75:33 - 75:37)
I also have friends who are like I don't (75:36 - 75:39)
like to do any kind of subscriptions at (75:37 - 75:41)
all they don't they don't want to ever (75:39 - 75:42)
do subscription services no matter what (75:41 - 75:44)
the cost is or any what the benefit they (75:42 - 75:45)
just hate the fact that it's a (75:44 - 75:47)
subscription yeah I just think of red (75:45 - 75:49)
and blue of like that's getting a link (75:47 - 75:51)
cable it's like 15 bucks I mean if it (75:49 - 75:53)
was the Nintendo brand Italy cable I (75:51 - 75:55)
think it was 20 bucks I was like you (75:53 - 75:57)
needed a link cable to trade I mean I (75:55 - 75:58)
hate the argument of like well trading (75:57 - 76:01)
always used to be free no red and blue (75:58 - 76:05)
is not free it was $20 and let me tell (76:01 - 76:07)
you it was very very very hard to (76:05 - 76:09)
convince my mom to spend $20 on a link (76:07 - 76:10)
cable because she was like you're never (76:09 - 76:11)
going to use it (76:10 - 76:13)
she might have been right I might have (76:11 - 76:17)
only traded like twice and yeah I guess (76:13 - 76:19)
your friend could Medellin cable but uh (76:17 - 76:22)
it was never it was never free to trade (76:19 - 76:25)
and it is technically you could trade (76:22 - 76:27)
for free and sword and shield if you are (76:25 - 76:29)
in the same room as somebody else I just (76:27 - 76:34)
it's kind of shocking to me that I guess (76:29 - 76:35)
now that you've explained they beat the (76:34 - 76:36)
Elite Four they're done with the game (76:35 - 76:39)
that is a lot of Pokemon people to do (76:36 - 76:42)
that to just okay I'm done playing the (76:39 - 76:44)
game I'm moving on to different games (76:42 - 76:49)
but I I it seems this is the second (76:44 - 76:51)
promoted of or okay so if we don't count (76:49 - 76:53)
the Giganta back stuff it's ignore all (76:51 - 76:55)
that this is the second promoted event (76:53 - 76:57)
that isn't a gigantic so they did the (76:55 - 76:59)
delibird stuff back around Christmas (76:57 - 77:01)
they made delibird spawn everywhere same (76:59 - 77:04)
same same concept you have to connect to (77:01 - 77:06)
the wild area news get the delibird push (77:04 - 77:10)
delibird gave better rewards I gave a (77:06 - 77:14)
lot of candy yeah give desti knots this (77:10 - 77:18)
Magikarp gave a bunch of nuggets so is (77:14 - 77:21)
so this is like I guess the conversation (77:18 - 77:23)
I want to move to (77:21 - 77:26)
is even if you were like why I don't (77:23 - 77:28)
need magic er I don't want a battle (77:26 - 77:29)
Magikarp I don't need Magikarp if you're (77:28 - 77:32)
still playing the game this is like V (77:29 - 77:35)
this is the best time to money ratio you (77:32 - 77:38)
probably could have gotten of I'm gonna (77:35 - 77:39)
do this magic or parade with friends and (77:38 - 77:41)
even though I don't need the Magikarp (77:39 - 77:44)
the amount of rewards you're getting I (77:41 - 77:48)
feel like is respectful of your time yes (77:44 - 77:50)
I agree even though I ended up leaving (77:48 - 77:54)
this event with nine shiny Magikarp and (77:50 - 77:56)
anyone could have looked at me and said (77:54 - 77:57)
why do you need a knight in shining (77:56 - 78:01)
Magikarp I don't I I I'm not gonna you (77:57 - 78:02)
know apply for a job one day and write (78:01 - 78:04)
down that I got nine tiny Magikarp like (78:02 - 78:06)
it's not beneficial to me at all (78:04 - 78:08)
the rewards that I was doing and the fun (78:06 - 78:10)
I was having was a thousand percent (78:08 - 78:13)
worth it like it was just so fun to keep (78:10 - 78:15)
finding Magikarp with other people and (78:13 - 78:17)
those people getting excited and they're (78:15 - 78:18)
not getting excited and it is always fun (78:17 - 78:21)
to be like oh this one shiny cool but (78:18 - 78:23)
like who can't like it like got to good (78:21 - 78:25)
enough sweet give one one will say as (78:23 - 78:27)
Magikarp one will be Gyarados but man (78:25 - 78:29)
need about the amount of nuggets I got (78:27 - 78:32)
was just like this is awesome I could I (78:29 - 78:35)
could do this forever and granted it was (78:32 - 78:37)
four days but I think that was a good (78:35 - 78:38)
amount of time to I think even two days (78:37 - 78:40)
would have been good I think maybe more (78:38 - 78:42)
than four days might have fell a little (78:40 - 78:43)
bit drawn-out because it does push other (78:42 - 78:46)
raids away if they if they continued to (78:43 - 78:49)
do stuff like this I think it does then (78:46 - 78:51)
add value and maybe your two friends (78:49 - 78:55)
would reconsider of like is the $25 a (78:51 - 78:58)
year worth it to them if once a month (78:55 - 79:01)
they can participate in what seems to be (78:58 - 79:03)
I don't know I don't know the easiest (79:01 - 79:04)
way to compare it to maybe like a (79:03 - 79:07)
community today of hey let's come a we (79:04 - 79:11)
we be delayed for we we saw the credits (79:07 - 79:13)
we're moving on to different games but (79:11 - 79:16)
once a month for three days we can play (79:13 - 79:18)
with our friends come back to Pokemon (79:16 - 79:21)
do these magikarps do these deli birds (79:18 - 79:24)
do whatever else they have planned this (79:21 - 79:25)
games not even two months old and (79:24 - 79:27)
they've already done two promoted non (79:25 - 79:31)
GMAX events and then maybe (79:27 - 79:33)
they decide to get into competitive they (79:31 - 79:35)
decide to finish their pokedex they (79:33 - 79:37)
decide to maybe actually try to explore (79:35 - 79:39)
the wild like I think this is what we've (79:37 - 79:41)
always wanted in Pokemon games and (79:39 - 79:42)
they're actually finally delivering that (79:41 - 79:45)
and I feel like that conversation has (79:42 - 79:47)
been lost to people because they're like (79:45 - 79:49)
oh a shiny Magikarp which is like cool (79:47 - 79:52)
I don't but like the cooler thing is (79:49 - 79:54)
we're seeing these events now in the (79:52 - 79:57)
game I mean I think so but it may be too (79:54 - 79:58)
little too late since people don't (79:57 - 79:59)
expect this kind of stuff they're not (79:58 - 80:01)
looking for it to happen and even though (79:59 - 80:02)
it's happening they're not gonna (80:01 - 80:04)
participate because they just don't (80:02 - 80:06)
expect it you don't think those same (80:04 - 80:08)
friends now that they've seen that (80:06 - 80:09)
there's a shiny Magikarp and (80:08 - 80:10)
unfortunately it doesn't seem like they (80:09 - 80:11)
were able to compete if there was (80:10 - 80:17)
another I don't know animes debuting so (80:11 - 80:21)
SHINee knocked out only only if I was (80:17 - 80:24)
sitting there and said hey there's this (80:21 - 80:25)
shiny event they won't even know about (80:24 - 80:27)
it they won't even know interesting I (80:25 - 80:31)
feel like that's so I know three people (80:27 - 80:33)
who have never played Pokemon heavily (80:31 - 80:38)
before who are very much into sword and (80:33 - 80:40)
shield and the post game and are like (80:38 - 80:41)
still playing it and get very excited (80:40 - 80:42)
for these events (80:41 - 80:45)
I think it's hitting more people than we (80:42 - 80:47)
think because there's something about (80:45 - 80:51)
the switch that has changed things for a (80:47 - 80:54)
lot of people I know but it's just your (80:51 - 80:55)
traditional video game player wants to (80:54 - 80:57)
get to the credits and be done (80:55 - 81:00)
yura and even a lot of people who just (80:57 - 81:01)
picked up sword and shield because they (81:00 - 81:03)
know Pokemon games are generally a good (81:01 - 81:05)
experience they get to the credits and (81:03 - 81:07)
they're not paying attention to the (81:05 - 81:09)
Pokemon news anymore there they do they (81:07 - 81:10)
just don't want to do it anymore (81:09 - 81:12)
and this is this is what Masuda and (81:10 - 81:15)
other higher and game freak people have (81:12 - 81:17)
said this is why I like the battle (81:15 - 81:18)
frontier didn't make it an Omega Ruby (81:17 - 81:22)
alpha sapphire they completely know that (81:18 - 81:24)
most players get to the credits may move (81:22 - 81:27)
on and so it's hard to spend so much (81:24 - 81:32)
time developing a vast postgame that the (81:27 - 81:34)
majority of their audience is not going (81:32 - 81:36)
to play and that they need to promote (81:34 - 81:38)
that post game more like before the game (81:36 - 81:40)
is sold so that people who are these (81:38 - 81:44)
kinds of I think if you went into it (81:40 - 81:46)
I think the mine is I don't think they (81:44 - 81:47)
did this for delibird but I think for (81:46 - 81:49)
specifically for the Magikarp it popped (81:47 - 81:50)
up in the my Nintendo news so they (81:49 - 81:54)
pushed it to all switch owners in the - (81:50 - 81:55)
had no news that there was a Magikarp (81:54 - 81:58)
event goes into my I mean don't you yeah (81:55 - 81:59)
but like I'm how he just shoves up on (81:58 - 82:01)
the side every time I go I'm just saying (81:59 - 82:04)
like how how else do you promote this (82:01 - 82:06)
event I mean they had they tweeted about (82:04 - 82:12)
it it's on Pokemon comm calls from China (82:06 - 82:14)
I might as well get them from Nintendo I (82:12 - 82:16)
also think they did something very (82:14 - 82:17)
different with this game as they (82:16 - 82:21)
introduced what is the postgame early (82:17 - 82:23)
like the wild area is the third thing (82:21 - 82:26)
you hit and so there is there is that (82:23 - 82:28)
breadcrumb because you go back to it a (82:26 - 82:30)
number of times and every time you go (82:28 - 82:34)
back to it new things happen and at the (82:30 - 82:36)
end of postgame be like hey things have (82:34 - 82:38)
changed there and you can go to more (82:36 - 82:40)
places so I think I don't know what more (82:38 - 82:42)
they could do for bread crumbing to get (82:40 - 82:44)
people to go back there to see these (82:42 - 82:47)
events like they did a really good job (82:44 - 82:50)
in promoting this wild area as being the (82:47 - 82:53)
post game throughout the entire game I I (82:50 - 82:55)
don't know what they could do to better (82:53 - 82:56)
promote that they're doing something (82:55 - 83:00)
special like I saw it but I I don't know (82:56 - 83:02)
I think this is the first game where (83:00 - 83:05)
they're actively taking steps to say (83:02 - 83:08)
there is a much bigger post game yeah (83:05 - 83:10)
and it just might take time I think I (83:08 - 83:11)
think we'll you're making excellent (83:10 - 83:14)
points of like if somebody beat the game (83:11 - 83:15)
saw credits they put away the game how (83:14 - 83:17)
do you communicate to them to come back (83:15 - 83:19)
to the game are they following Pokemon (83:17 - 83:20)
on Twitter are they following Pokemon on (83:19 - 83:21)
Facebook (83:20 - 83:23)
do they go to Pokemon comm spoiler for (83:21 - 83:25)
that one no one goes to Pokemon comm (83:23 - 83:27)
they're always have people are always (83:25 - 83:29)
shocked that we weaken to continue to (83:27 - 83:31)
pull news for Pokemon calm every single (83:29 - 83:34)
week they're a really good resource they (83:31 - 83:36)
might not be the fastest resource no (83:34 - 83:38)
Pokemon comm is a really good resource (83:36 - 83:39)
of what's happening in sword and shield (83:38 - 83:42)
right now they pushed it to all switch (83:39 - 83:44)
owners whether or not they check the (83:42 - 83:48)
mine attend no news I don't but I do (83:44 - 83:51)
know it's there so like I don't know how (83:48 - 83:54)
else you communicate to people that an (83:51 - 83:56)
event is going on (83:54 - 83:58)
and while the delibird event might have (83:56 - 84:00)
passed a lot of people in radar I think (83:58 - 84:02)
this event was a little bit more (84:00 - 84:04)
effective but I don't know if it was (84:02 - 84:06)
more effective because they increase the (84:04 - 84:08)
shiny ads for Magikarp I calculated them (84:06 - 84:09)
myself (84:08 - 84:11)
because I happen to stream on Twitch and (84:09 - 84:15)
because uh you know 200 people were (84:11 - 84:16)
watching me and they were also doing (84:15 - 84:17)
these raids (84:16 - 84:19)
I said hey before you leave from the (84:17 - 84:20)
night before you say goodbye let me know (84:19 - 84:21)
how many raids you did let me know how (84:20 - 84:23)
many were shiny collected all that data (84:21 - 84:28)
and I got about 12% of the raids were (84:23 - 84:30)
shiny now obviously there was a flaw in (84:28 - 84:33)
that because it was possible that me and (84:30 - 84:35)
Greg could have done a raid together we (84:33 - 84:36)
both got shiny reaper reported back so I (84:35 - 84:38)
figured that number was a little bit (84:36 - 84:39)
higher I then reached out to Joe to (84:38 - 84:42)
Sarah be talk to Joe and he said that he (84:39 - 84:43)
could actually see it in the code (84:42 - 84:49)
whatever that means I have a I disagreed (84:43 - 84:50)
with Joe on a lot of things but (84:49 - 84:52)
apparently in the code it said that the (84:50 - 84:55)
shiny Magikarp were 8% which does come (84:52 - 84:58)
to a 1 in 12 chance if one in 12.5 (84:55 - 85:02)
chance so one out of 12.5 raids would (84:58 - 85:03)
have gotten you a shiny Magikarp which (85:02 - 85:05)
is higher than community odds which is 1 (85:03 - 85:08)
in 25 I guess raids do technically take (85:05 - 85:11)
longer to do than just tapping on a (85:08 - 85:13)
Magikarp in Pokemon go and running away (85:11 - 85:17)
you can't run away from a raid I think (85:13 - 85:19)
that's a good amount think that's not (85:17 - 85:20)
low enough not high enough I think (85:19 - 85:22)
that's a good amount where people were (85:20 - 85:24)
like oh my gosh is Magikarp assignee and (85:22 - 85:26)
again going back to the first (85:24 - 85:28)
conversation even if it wasn't shiny (85:26 - 85:30)
it's still worth your time because the (85:28 - 85:33)
rewards were so good I got a shiny on my (85:30 - 85:35)
first one so it was worth it enough for (85:33 - 85:37)
me it's awesome and I think I think it (85:35 - 85:40)
does prove well not that it needs to be (85:37 - 85:41)
proven I think like it doesn't matter (85:40 - 85:43)
what shiny odds are it doesn't matter if (85:41 - 85:46)
it's 1 in 8,000 or if it's 1 in 5 I (85:43 - 85:48)
think going into a raid and being like (85:46 - 85:50)
oh my gosh this is shiny is pretty fun (85:48 - 85:51)
every time I think that's why Community (85:50 - 85:53)
Day works who cares if the odds are 1 in (85:51 - 85:55)
25 and they're there they're not as (85:53 - 85:58)
special because the hundreds of (85:55 - 86:00)
thousands of people I played community (85:58 - 86:02)
with in the last three years they're (86:00 - 86:05)
still excited every time that that (86:02 - 86:06)
pokemons a different color and the (86:05 - 86:08)
sparkles appear every single time (86:06 - 86:09)
they're still excited (86:08 - 86:12)
I'm excited because it's like aha one (86:09 - 86:17)
less that I have to care about so the (86:12 - 86:18)
other thing that I think is interesting (86:17 - 86:22)
is that this game is yet to have an (86:18 - 86:25)
update if we look at the history of x (86:22 - 86:27)
and y's Sun and Moon ultra Sun an ultra (86:25 - 86:28)
moon (86:27 - 86:29)
a lots ago Pikachu they all received (86:28 - 86:32)
updates in January whether or not this (86:29 - 86:33)
game will get an update in January (86:32 - 86:36)
unsure there seems to be a lot of things (86:33 - 86:38)
they need to fix yeah I think (86:36 - 86:40)
sucker-punch is broken competitively (86:38 - 86:43)
there's a couple spots in the wild area (86:40 - 86:45)
where no music plays at all I don't know (86:43 - 86:48)
if that's intentional or not the game at (86:45 - 86:50)
least for me has crashed three times in (86:48 - 86:52)
the last two months where I can't think (86:50 - 86:53)
of other Pokemon games that have crashed (86:52 - 86:57)
I mean there there's a couple issues but (86:53 - 87:01)
some people specifically Joe thinks the (86:57 - 87:04)
shiny odds are broken for the the (87:01 - 87:06)
catching slash knocking out method (87:04 - 87:10)
although we don't know because we had (87:06 - 87:12)
this conversation a week ago we only (87:10 - 87:15)
have one person data mining the code and (87:12 - 87:17)
sharing it to Joe and they've been wrong (87:15 - 87:20)
multiple times in the past especially (87:17 - 87:22)
about how people for the first two weeks (87:20 - 87:24)
thought you had to combo and then (87:22 - 87:26)
Pokemon calm said there are no combos (87:24 - 87:29)
except for chain fishing which doesn't (87:26 - 87:31)
lead to shiny pokemon only with some (87:29 - 87:33)
brilliant Pokemon the interesting thing (87:31 - 87:35)
here with the magic carps are they wear (87:33 - 87:38)
all the the square shinies and normally (87:35 - 87:40)
in raids because they're static (87:38 - 87:43)
encounters that raids are the same as (87:40 - 87:46)
Masuda and the same as tree and the same (87:43 - 87:47)
as any static encounter in the game (87:46 - 87:50)
where it's 15 out of 16 chance of being (87:47 - 87:53)
stars 1 out of 16 chances of being (87:50 - 87:57)
squares not only without pushing an (87:53 - 87:58)
update to the game server side they were (87:57 - 88:01)
able to change raids to Magikarp which (87:58 - 88:02)
have them before with Ellie Burton stuff (88:01 - 88:05)
they changed it to Magikarp they changed (88:02 - 88:08)
the rewards they changed the shields (88:05 - 88:09)
which I don't think a lot of people (88:08 - 88:12)
noticed so if you were in a 5-star (88:09 - 88:14)
Magikarp you had a you had a 5-star (88:12 - 88:17)
shield but if it was a 5-star shiny (88:14 - 88:20)
Magikarp it was actually a six it was (88:17 - 88:23)
actually six shields the shiny Magikarp (88:20 - 88:23)
hadn't (88:23 - 88:25)
extra shield in a five star raid which (88:23 - 88:28)
is interesting unless I'm wrong on that (88:25 - 88:30)
but that was something I noticed and (88:28 - 88:32)
then the third thing was they forced all (88:30 - 88:35)
of those magikarps to be squared shinies (88:32 - 88:37)
and not the star shinies for whatever (88:35 - 88:40)
that's worth it's worth nothing spoiler (88:37 - 88:42)
but they they seem to have a lot of (88:40 - 88:44)
control on what they can do when they (88:42 - 88:46)
push it out obviously that makes sense I (88:44 - 88:48)
don't think about like any any of those (88:46 - 88:50)
three things the extra shield the (88:48 - 88:55)
rewards the the type of shiny was an (88:50 - 89:01)
accident okay question of the week this (88:55 - 89:02)
better be good I've seen as musical (89:01 - 89:03)
twice this week (89:02 - 89:08)
I know ready ask me it's so easy to quiz (89:03 - 89:14)
me on my knowledge of all things around (89:08 - 89:20)
Pokemon if you ask me you'll find out (89:14 - 89:29)
what my answer is to the question of the (89:20 - 89:34)
we standing ovation standing of it (89:29 - 89:38)
beautiful not a dry eye in the house I'd (89:34 - 89:45)
even do the key change yet find it make (89:38 - 89:49)
it happen this is from Lance from our (89:45 - 89:51)
attic channel in slack (89:49 - 89:53)
we actually touched on this earlier do (89:51 - 89:55)
you think we'll see voice acting in the (89:53 - 89:57)
series in its life on the switch Fire (89:55 - 89:59)
Emblem got a lot of praise for being (89:57 - 90:01)
fully voice acted which may be (89:59 - 90:03)
influential for a game for a while I'm (90:01 - 90:05)
ok mmm (90:03 - 90:08)
free computers on drum so would you want (90:05 - 90:10)
full voice acting or just minimal (90:08 - 90:12)
character grunts or phrases like masters (90:10 - 90:15)
does I'm trying to think of what game I (90:12 - 90:16)
played that has full voice acting but (90:15 - 90:19)
when you hit a it skips to the next (90:16 - 90:22)
thing like I would like full voice (90:19 - 90:26)
acting as long as there is a way to also (90:22 - 90:29)
like oh Final Fantasy 14 does that where (90:26 - 90:31)
they'll start the speech but if you've (90:29 - 90:33)
read it faster you can hit a and it (90:31 - 90:35)
skips to the next section that's the (90:33 - 90:37)
kind of voice acting I would like (90:35 - 90:39)
but yes I would like voice acting in my (90:37 - 90:42)
games although I do tend to play them (90:39 - 90:43)
with sound off (90:42 - 90:45)
but I didn't this time cuz I had it on (90:43 - 90:47)
the big TV so yeah I'm back to having (90:45 - 90:49)
voice acting I went all around all (90:47 - 90:51)
around the world of I'm back voice (90:49 - 90:53)
acting yes and and I would say I would I (90:51 - 90:56)
would like voice acting but they don't (90:53 - 90:57)
even have enough room to put all the (90:56 - 90:59)
pokemons oh yeah a bunch of audio (90:57 - 91:02)
recordings movie bringing that up who (90:59 - 91:06)
knew that road will turn into a national (91:02 - 91:10)
Dexter over the last because he wants to (91:06 - 91:12)
find things to hate about the game this (91:10 - 91:16)
is Audrina Nicole my heart is a block of (91:12 - 91:18)
ice you got that right well I would like (91:16 - 91:21)
to see more of a master style thing (91:18 - 91:24)
personally (91:21 - 91:24)
I wouldn't I wouldn't hate it if (91:25 - 91:28)
everything was fully voice-acted but I (91:27 - 91:30)
think the I think the Masters stuff is (91:28 - 91:33)
is really effective is it super (91:30 - 91:35)
effective let's not get carried away (91:33 - 91:38)
here will give us our pokemon of the (91:35 - 91:42)
week well the last week's pokemon of the (91:38 - 91:44)
week Oh what were those horrible (91:42 - 91:45)
horrible clues had something to do with (91:44 - 91:48)
me being a kid in Hawaii and Firefox I (91:45 - 91:51)
don't know um well because it was (91:48 - 91:53)
related to you the typing of a fire (91:51 - 91:56)
fireworks Pokemon but it wasn't the (91:53 - 91:59)
fireworks Pokemon because I had already (91:56 - 92:04)
done that one this has the typing of (91:59 - 92:07)
this the week's Pokemon it's pre (92:04 - 92:10)
evolution doesn't have any equal typing (92:07 - 92:12)
to it so it's a completely new set of (92:10 - 92:17)
typing and you could only get it very (92:12 - 92:19)
recently even though I didn't say this (92:17 - 92:21)
but it's pre evolution has been around (92:19 - 92:25)
since the first games but this Pokemon (92:21 - 92:28)
you could only get recently (92:25 - 92:34)
so who's that Pokemon it's chocolate (92:28 - 92:38)
Wow not in generation 1 (92:34 - 92:42)
it's a lowland marowak a lowland marowak (92:38 - 92:47)
you are correct the fire ghosts or ghost (92:42 - 92:48)
fire I don't know which one it was (92:47 - 92:52)
exactly fire ghost it is fire Christian (92:48 - 92:55)
chandelure which I said was its cousin (92:52 - 92:58)
his ghost fire yes so there's the (92:55 - 93:01)
difference and it's also weird that it (92:58 - 93:03)
can learn flame wheel hex and shadow (93:01 - 93:06)
bone before level 28 but it doesn't (93:03 - 93:08)
evolve into a little marowak until level (93:06 - 93:12)
8 so it's like you guess gotta use the (93:08 - 93:14)
Move remember for those ones even though (93:12 - 93:16)
it never learned them in the first place (93:14 - 93:19)
here's some useless trivia a lowland (93:16 - 93:21)
marowak weevil porygon zr the same (93:19 - 93:25)
weight as dawn watch hey bola pedia (93:21 - 93:28)
coming through strong here really how (93:25 - 93:34)
how light is dawn uh 75 pounds okay (93:28 - 93:36)
ten-year-old girl normally weighs 75 (93:34 - 93:37)
pounds (93:36 - 93:40)
I don't know ten-year-old girls come in (93:37 - 93:42)
all shapes and sizes (93:40 - 93:47)
not according to yellow and marowak is (93:42 - 93:50)
the only dual type pokemon that shares (93:47 - 93:53)
no types with its pre evolution Moo (93:50 - 93:56)
fancy though a lowland marowak shares (93:53 - 93:58)
the ability to rock head with hugh bone (93:56 - 94:01)
a cuban with rock head cannot evolve (93:58 - 94:03)
into a lowland marowak with the same (94:01 - 94:06)
ability as rock head is cubans first (94:03 - 94:09)
ability and a lowland marowak's hidden (94:06 - 94:11)
ability (94:09 - 94:14)
huh that Scheffel sprites real good (94:11 - 94:15)
though perfect (94:14 - 94:17)
it is the ads good it's good we need (94:15 - 94:20)
both sprites are good pokemon Lola of a (94:17 - 94:22)
Lola marowak wasn't shuffle yeah yeah (94:20 - 94:27)
everything up to Mar shadow was in (94:22 - 94:29)
shuffle (94:27 - 94:29)
on shuffle too soon we need shuffle too (94:30 - 94:36)
so we can get sprites oh yeah yeah oh (94:32 - 94:40)
come on I need that rammer and shuffle (94:36 - 94:43)
with or without Pikachu all three of you (94:40 - 94:46)
have to have Pikachu Eric Kudo okay you (94:43 - 94:49)
gotta have all of them it make sense (94:46 - 94:53)
what's the next week's Pokemon well you (94:49 - 94:57)
thought that Greg's question of the week (94:53 - 94:59)
song would be your only reference to a (94:57 - 95:03)
particular film but you would be (94:59 - 95:07)
thinking wrong I was also inspired by (95:03 - 95:10)
[Laughter] (95:07 - 95:13)
that particular film for this week's (95:10 - 95:16)
Pokemon of the week so fasten your seat (95:13 - 95:20)
belts kids strapped in if I can do this (95:16 - 95:21)
without laughing (95:20 - 95:24)
that would be a miracle what's your (95:21 - 95:35)
typical choice Jellico Pokemon oh this (95:24 - 95:36)
let me stare at the burger could the (95:35 - 95:39)
beautiful Burger King sign like the moon (95:36 - 95:44)
in the sky the gem in the matter of (95:39 - 95:47)
finding our Pokemon creatures particular (95:44 - 95:50)
aspects we must keep we must reconcile (95:47 - 95:53)
their name their species abilities quite (95:50 - 95:55)
surely but also the route where they (95:53 - 95:59)
domicile nu Nova on 4 and 18 if you're (95:55 - 96:01)
lucky you'll see this week's eating a (95:59 - 96:04)
yeah Papa berry in Kalos in hordes on (96:01 - 96:07)
route 5 there are many practicing to (96:04 - 96:10)
intimidate to appear very scary on our (96:07 - 96:12)
return to Hoenn we travelled quite far (96:10 - 96:15)
to 113 and then we must look very (96:12 - 96:18)
closely this week's Pokemon can only be (96:15 - 96:21)
found if it peeks out its head perhaps (96:18 - 96:24)
to be nosy while visiting a Lola are her (96:21 - 96:26)
first trip no dice (96:24 - 96:29)
yet on our return without too much luck (96:26 - 96:32)
we discovered some boys before the red (96:29 - 96:34)
meadow and some girls near the town with (96:32 - 96:37)
a broken-down truck grand gala with its (96:34 - 96:40)
castles its curries its camps appears to (96:37 - 96:43)
have two routes we can place the mystery (96:40 - 96:44)
pokémon (96:43 - 96:47)
Stoke outskirts is one and Galler mine (96:44 - 96:50)
number two it does grace one last bit of (96:47 - 96:53)
advice if you would be so keen to find a (96:50 - 96:55)
species member with the ability stated (96:53 - 96:58)
travel to the wild area peer into a den (96:55 - 97:01)
it is in a max raid you'll be quite (96:58 - 97:03)
elated (97:01 - 97:04)
actually the last line if if it's in a (97:03 - 97:06)
max raid you'll be quite elated but (97:04 - 97:10)
goodness my microphone got in the way oh (97:06 - 97:10)
so hard to write that five minutes (97:11 - 97:15)
before we started recording I guess I (97:13 - 97:19)
