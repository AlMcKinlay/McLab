[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 390s episode three nine zero of the pokemon podcast it's super effective I am your host SBJ with me I have will and I shout out to all the teens and not teams of the world with braces and everything I am with you my friends for the next year if people think I speak a little funny again or worse more funny than I used to it's because I have started Invisalign and I I'm in that place with you at least for the next 52 weeks you hate it he is a strong word because this is something I wanted for myself certainly challenged a lot of unexpected bits that are life impacting but you know I'll work through it for the next year so that I can learn to smile again potentially that again wouldn't be smiling the first time I mean I smiled when I was like two nolde yeah okay yep sure smile when they fart come on way to start off this year Greg is here hello hello hello I am here bringing all the cheer that will doesn't bring Greg with his perfect teeth and his perfect smile I hey Greg Greg Greg don't look at my bottom row you got some Pokemon news we have some Pokemon Go news of course guess we can talk about the Cynthia that arrived in Pokemon masters there was a Pokemon sword and shield event in the last week if you missed it you missed it it's overnight but we can we could talk about it because it was really cool and the new competitive has started in sword and shield and that's it that's that's what we got to talk about today hopefully you all had a happy without further delay let's let's kick off the news with the most exciting news first and then it'll be all downhill this is James from our slack community sent this in off Nintendo live.com your next Pokemon Build A Bear is flareon ooh I know at least two people who love Flareon at least two we can we just say only two I mean I can't say that scientifically other Pokemon No how do those two people feel about always being wrong in life well what was your roommate so how did he feel very wrong in life he's making furniture now so you know he makes him beautiful furniture he died he built a bear is continuing their collaboration with Pokemon which is actually probably the more exciting news here that build-a-bear and Pokemon have this relationship that they haven't gotten divorced yet strong it's very impressive the latest addition to the Pokemon build-a-bear lineup is Flareon an evolution of the already available Eevee it is the first evolution of Eevee we've seen it in build-a-bear form this is purely speculation on our part we can imagine this could mean we could see more EVs in the future you know I'm glad you wrote it that way Nintendo left because that is true we shouldn't assume but what I can I can tell you as somebody who is deep in the Pokemon community whether that is for better or for worse we do joke about flare out being the least popular but it is it is the least popular it's wait it's even less popular in Vaporeon obey programs very popular cards we dig fishy tale thing it's cute no area doesn't even benefit from being good competitive okay we're not all here for your battle amusements Caesar I mean that's what the game is is battle amusements the game so that my tinfoil hat theory this is this is all this is all Tony Tony my tinfoil hat theory is some of the most popular Eevee evolutions I would say top three are probably Umbreon Espeon and sylveon those are probably top three statistically I could agree with you yes I have a sylveon hat and I think because Flareon is the worst my theory is they're starting with the worst so they know baseline what sales should be going forward okay two things number one please don't ever say 2020 for the rest of the year because every time somebody says that now I'm confused whether they're referencing the year or whether they're referencing clear vision so that's a band for this program show that they did what was the first build-a-bear Pokemon they do yeah so was that like the least loved one so they could find out whether it be a successful business venture at that point no they you don't put you don't collab with build-a-bear and expect Pikachu not to sell did you start with like Bulbasaur no no well no bubble stars popular it's number one in the Pokedex it's obviously the most popular Pokemon ah because that's how that was else think that Larry ends face and this picture is really pitched really weird yeah pinchy you can't I mean you could you could just do Umbreon and Espeon but then people that but then you fall into the trap of people demanding the other ones so with Pikachu it's like one and done right we did the Pikachu it sold millions Eevee sold millions all right well we really want to give people sylveon Espeon an Umbreon but we can't give them three of the no a seven eight how many are there we have to eventually give them Flair so it's like it's like the it's like the bandaid on your arm you just gotta rip it off all right here's your flare add quickly get it out the door okay it only sold five all right well at least we know we can tell our build-a-bear stockholders you can fear not this look we've we already knew this was our worst selling Eevee evolution I'm I'm a little confused because the the actual Eevee that they did for build-a-bear is super cute is very cute buzzer is probably the best one they've done does the Flareon play weird Ben trace it looks like a gray from a spaceship that's coming to take me away and perform weird medical experiments on me in their UFO that's the kind of face it has yeah it's and their orbital get it get it give paw Qumran pun and you said the UFO and I changed it to their orbital I don't know what an orbital is yeah that's gonna be a loss of the person that has to I've told you the story of the octillery I just I need a moment well as you take a moment we'll move on to our Pokemon masters news we kind of touched on this last week with my masters Cynthia and Ray or Lance and Cynthia were added but not at the same time even though they both appeared in the I don't know hallway event hall I don't know what that is space is called the big Pokemon Center hallway everybody Cynthia's now available yep I'm older yet I have pulled her the so gaily event is now on yep they what's the team a Pokemon masters they they said don't worry everyone it's easier that view to I was able to do the so gaily event in less than an hour just by hitting the like battle again and over and over and I think I got like 10 tickets every time and you need a hundred and then you get so Gallio or so Galia so go Leo I think is how you say okay Leo you get so go Leo and I have it but there's more missions after it I think team Lear know the dude's name is Lear what is the bad team name team ask I don't know they show up no this isn't pokemon dual I can't beat them yet and then I realized so this is my question for you Greg yes when you go to Trisha its F is team break great got it when you go to Trisha she wants a million tickets sure first she wants 400 and then she wants like 600 and then she wants a thousand where am i yeah I was only getting ten ticket submission who is grinding out 4,000 tickets and why like I already have the so Kaleo but okay so the first time you do the first three coops you get boosted tickets what you thought I've wasted like 200 yeah so I think I ended up today with 300 after I ran everything today just from running those three for the coop because it's super I haven't done the fourth one because the fourth one like so in the weird thing is in the Mewtwo event you used to get you get mu 2 tickets from the first three but you did get it for the hardest one you got gems maybe it looks like it's the same this way you don't get tickets when you do the fourth event you just get gems so I haven't run the fourth one because it's difficult and running it with strangers where you can't communicate is just frustrating so I've skipped it but every day when you run those co-op ones the first time you get boosted tickets which is the only way to get tickets to power up your pair well you hat well if you have Cynthia I don't think you have to communicate right how are people going in with three Cynthia's yeah except the fourth one generally if you don't do the exact prescribed thing you'll get wiped out this is the way it was from you to like if somebody didn't come in with a way to eliminate their stat increases they one-shot everybody so I haven't done it because I'm not like the mutual and was so frustrating that I decided that I didn't want to be frustrated running this once I've just been doing the first leap but the first the everyday if you run those first three you get extra super extra tickets okay I haven't unlocked the co-op stuff yet oh yeah you need to do I'm on like chapter 9 which I think is I think there's 18 chapters um no I think there's 16 oh okay well I might be 18 I don't know I'm not there I'm making it you didn't beat the story so co-op this is a sub where any story I'm assuming yeah so I would love I have a love-hate relationship with this game because of the play there's 20 chapters oh I have a love/hate relationship with this game mm-hmm I have hit the wall you talked about I need a bunch of red soda yep so I guess I described missions for red soda I suppose yep and this is this is my biggest complaint with the game is that grinding those you can't you can't auto skip it like you can't you have to play the game because they're auto function is still real not great unlike a lot of other Gacha games where you slowly over time build up skip tickets there's no such thing in this game so I can't say well I need 50 more Oh see this is where your knowledge comes in because you play out the gotcha game so they have the same grind but you can just pay to skip it with tickets that you earn that you've earned so like in other games I can just say well I need some more I need some more light orbs I'll go to the light orbs one that have already completed it knows that I've done it and I'll just hit the skip ticket option and it just says okay here's your rewards because you I've already proven to the game that I've done this so what frustrates me and masters is I've proven to the game that I've done this many many many times I should be able to just say please don't waste my time making me do this again let me have it an option to spend a ticket to skip it and then earning those tickets can be difficult or slow but like give me something that allows me to power up quickly so I don't have to feel like all I'm doing is grinding and that's what often turns me off playing masters like right now I'm playing the sole Galia one the co-op stuff is pretty easy for the first three I can breeze through them you know they're kind of fun but like the thought of trying to complete chapter 20 because I have to level up a certain sink pair to be able to do it which means I have to grind and there's no good way of grinding that that's often where I'm like I'm just gonna not play the game for a while because I I'm so frustrated having to grind with no quick way past it I was gonna ask like how how what keeps you going back all the time but if you're gonna be taking a break then that's nice I take a lot of breaks from Pokemon masters that's that's a good question because for me cuz I ignored this game for a couple months besides like logging in and getting gems right there they've been the the Pokemon master DNA the publisher of not publisher the developer of Pokemon masters has definitely given out a lot of gems yes I don't think we're going to not stop talking about Pokemon masters in the foreseeable future since its kind of become this game that updates very frequently like Pokemon go but for for now if you are slight if you are ever ever so slightly interested in Pokemon masters the first three times you log in as of to 2020 sorry well as of this year you can get a thousand gems for the first three days which is three thousand gems which is ten pulls yep which is very generous and I don't know if it counts or if you had to log in on new year's day but then they gave a bonus 2020 gems on new year's day I don't know if that's still available I don't think it is but there there's like a 14-day event right now the first three days are a thousand gems it doesn't matter where in the 14 days you start logging in so again if you're slightly curious and masters 3000 gems a lot for free and you just log in you hit claim reward and then you can go and I did this for several months where they they've had you know 50 gems login 100 gems login you know you've logged in 14 days in a row at the end you get 2,000 gems they've done a lot of these over the last few months so I was able to save about 50,000 gems and I think what finally hooked me is I pulled characters I cared about and the one that like super stuck out for whatever reason is Eliza who is the gym leader in black and white black and white - she's the model fashion model and she's like gym leader yes and she has up strike a and it's the the thing that mug poke my masters are so well and what keeps me coming back will is like once you find a character that you can like hearing them talk seeing actual personality in them which is what masters is like top-tier right now it's just like the little bit of dialogue that prior to like main series Pokemon games being like should they have voice acting in main series Pokemon games I would I would in the past argue like no that's too much time and money they could use in other places it's very hard to localize a game in like 8 different languages especially because Pokemon games now ship worldwide there's a lot of dialogue in Pokemon games and I mean a small but very vocal amount of Pokemon fans already wanted to skip all the cutscenes anyway I don't think anyone even if somebody's never played Pokemon my thought process is who would run out who's like no I don't want a Pokemon game but oh if they added voice acting now I'm in like that's not probably a situation most people who have never touched the series like that's not their main complaint is the lack of voice acting so when I heard masters had like voice acting I was like what but it's not like full voice acting it's just like these little quips yeah but those little quips at so much character to it that otherwise it just go wow that attack was zeb striking no no when you when you pull a character for the first time like if you pull Wulfric or more Marlin or Agatha they will easily never pull Wulfric oh oh I get nonstic and Bugsy I got a lot of Candace's so like when you pull iliza she's like hi I'm Eliza and it's like oh I actually know how to say your name now and then she'll say like one thing about her and then when you're playing with her she'll just have like these little quips of like let's go or you can do this Zeb striking no I don't think she's that person though no and then we never will she's like how am Olga waiting no she did she did so this comes back to Cynthia where I think obviously DNA is not foolish they know they've done their research they know what trainers slash people the audience wants so like holding back Chris for a while holding back Cynthia holding back Lance is smart because people will hoard gems or save gems or in this case I'm sure with Cynthia people they probably saw an uptake in revenue because one not only do people love Cynthia but to Cynthia's is very very good yes in when there aren't any good grounds other than Cynthia like it was a much needed addition I will say a couple of things that they have done so they've mitigated how bad pols feel by letting you pull more often now so that you know when you get your eighth bugsy in the row it doesn't feel like where it did before I have to wait another month before I can pull again because gems are coming much more regularly so it's mitigated how bad summoning used to feel it still doesn't feel great but it's not as bad my other sort of major complaint with the game still is if you're a big Pokemon player they do not play by the same type rules so dark types are not immune to psychic they're you know things that should have double weaknesses only have the weakness that's listed above their head and no others so it's it's a bit frustrating when you're used to playing the other Pokemon games that masters works very differently so when you're planning something you're like why did that happen well you gotta get like the TCG where the grass bug poison right I'll be what energy yeah it's frustrating in that fact it doesn't you have to sort of put masters in its own category like it plays by its own rule now and what you think will work or won't work you have to learn the rules of masters which is a little frustrating it's it's like okay it was particularly frustrating during the me to events because you know you'd have everybody have a team of their dark Pokemon and it was like psychic one shot at it I'm like oh how yeah but pokemon go is the same yes where moose will still do damage when they shouldn't yeah it's just it's you know right when I'm playing the other game and I'm very deep into a great game switching to this where it plays by its own rules is just like all right I see you speaking of the TCG this is all Pokemon calm Pokemon TCG Meowth Vmax special collection is now available this collection includes one promo card featuring Meowth of V one promo card featuring Meowth vmax one oversized foil card featuring Meowth vmax at an impressive size 5 Pokemon like extra long or no it's just the same big card not extra long 5 Pokemon TCG booster packs and a code for the Pokemon Trading Card Game online so I think this is the first vmax card that is on sale I don't I know there's the score bunny sob old gookie boxes that are available but I don't think they come with well the all these packs are coming with older cards but if you wanted like a Saba card early like those exist but I don't think we're getting those aren't always bad oh yeah yeah I don't think we're getting Galler stuff until February I'm pretty sure it's February so it's soon it's soon what was it there was um when we were playing well I can't remember specifically what it what what starters there were boat it wasn't was it it was back in Gen 5 I want to say it was maybe like Saru uh where there was a specifically like I'm McDonald's as a rule but that was like slightly better than the others a true is like it had like 10 more HP I think was it zero or was it Dino ah I can't mmm here remember there was something though that like McDonald's would have TOI like Pokemon toys and they would always come with a Pokemon card but something in the McDonald's set had 10 more HP than what you would normally get in like another set and that's like pretty common where it's like there's three different Chikorita z' and one Chikorita has this move and another Chikorita has this move but they both have like one retreat and 60 HP but this mcdonald's Chikorita has worse but it has 70 HP which is good for cuz a lot of bench attacks will do 30 so to 30s a 60 knock out but because it had 70 camera what it does anyways I am disturbed that there's actually something there is a rare it not a rarity coat a set code for McDonald's collection there are yes yeah yes they've been in the overall collection thing huh well I mean this is a zero with 50 HP and the McDonald's Collection card boy there are a lot of zero is printed oh you know speaking about weird collection stuff I forgot to bring this up on the show this is TCG related but back when detective Pikachu came out they did they did like exclusive cards at Game Stop and Target and Walmart I think were the three so like the day after detective Pikachu came out for that weekend you were you were like supposed to be able to go in the game stop and then ask for I think Game Stop had like snubbull and say like hey do you have the snubbull card and they gave it they gave me the snubbull card and then I think they had a poster and then it wasn't until like the following week they were available at Target and I think that was the same time the Bulbasaur like Funko pop came out and so when you went to Target they had I want to say like side duck and so these again I just like the McDonald's stuff they're like numbered cards and so of course me being a sucker I bought the giant bubbles her Funko pop I used my Pokemon pass and I scanned inside oh it was also when the shiny peek choo and shiny Eevee were available in Pokemon let's go and then I got my snuggle card and then it wasn't available in two like two weeks later that the Bulbasaur card was available at Walmart so I went to Walmart that weekend they had no clue what I'm talking about so I went to a different Walmart no clue what I'm talking about then we I went all the way out to Waukesha auctions not that far north all the way out to watch I GI had to drive all the way to eat in Prairie oh good gracious and they kind of knew what I was talking about but they were like we don't have any so I wrote the Pokemon company in email I went to support type Pokemon calm opened up a support ticket this was months ago this is one detective Pikachu came out and I said look I'm a little frustrated that you guys are working with Walmart not because specifically you're working with Walmart but specifically no one at Walmart knows these promotions that you're working with like I've been to many of Game Stop promotions you know since heartgold SoulSilver besides them wanting to try to sell me pre-orders Game Stop usually pretty good with Pokemon collaborations I don't think I've ever had like a dramatic issue their target kind of hit mess but nine times out of ten they know what you're talking about and or grab as many code cards as you want on the counter because we don't care yep we we know about it we just don't care and but Walmart had no clue what we were even talking about and so that's what I said in the email I didn't think anything of it and but they they actually got back to me and they said oh we're really sorry we will send you the Bulbasaur card you're missing and I don't know this Bulbasaur card was like three bucks and TCG player so I could've just went to TCG player and bought it yeah but you know I spent the time to go to three different Walmart's and if no one knew what I'm talking about I can't even imagine like how other people felt for the bubble sir because I can't be the only person in the Greater Milwaukee area walking into Walmart asking for a Bulbasaur card like somebody else had to have done this especially if you're going to the other stores and this was the hype of detective Pikachu they sent me two buzzer cards they actually like they sent me a form like a Google Form and they said fill this out so apparently I'm sure they got other emails so I felt up the Google Form and I they sent me two bulbasaur cards which there you go okay support da pokemon.com actually does stuff I guess well quality customer service is what they do and that's what they're known for clearly all right we got some sword and shield the news and some Pokemon good news but we're gonna take a

it's super effective or if that's way too long it's in the show notes or if you can remember is C dot cache that's another way to do it thank you so much for listening I hope you enjoy the rest of this episode and I hope you had a Happy New Year thanks so much I'm with the rest of the episode party with Worple during the adventure sync a hackathon I've got issues with this event do you love Pokemon go will do I love Pokemon go I play pokemon go every single day I'm popping lucky eggs left and right yeah do you love hatching eggs I used all of the special incubators they gave me as a free gift and I use the infinite incubator every single time in egg hatches I'm popping a new one up in there do you love wasted money well I mean I only use the free incubators so no leave it to me antic one listen to their community what a party had on Wurmple and then hide it behind eggs so but do people understand that Wurmple already looks like it's wearing a party hat yeah I know you're just like it's got a spike on top of its head that literally looks like a party hat just paint it you don't even need to go to the store and buy one just get some makeup and put some makeup put some spots on that thing and you got a party like everything in Pokemon I love hate relationship with with Pokemon go niet Tech has listened to the most vocal of fans you know the the gen winners as we call them very obsessed with their childhood and they wanted glasses on squirtle and then they complained that they weren't the right glasses well they weren't the right glasses look they all can't be that squirtle the JED winners who haven't watched a single anime this after maybe I'll give them credit they probably watched the orange islands they probably watched that filler season that was the orange islands but didn't watch a single episode be anime after the orange islands didn't go on the journey with ash and his Treecko who always had a straw in his mouth all the way up treacle Grovyle Sceptile that straw was always there no justice for Treecko there's probably other Pokemon that I could use as examples to know shiny Noctowl but never shine II knocked out for a long time justice for Treecko and then last year they they they did this loading screen and in the loading screen there was a Wurmple wearing a party hat and everyone lost their minds was it 2018 or was a 2019 I think was last year in July Janek yeah and they delivered party hat Worple here but only in 2k eggs which to be I you know to be fair this is all this is the problem though 2k eggs are fine cuz they're a lot easier to hatch but the game is designed and set up in a way this is this is why I hate to give you more 2k eggs but then you feel like the super incubator that you've purchased you're wasting it because that it like reduces the walk time by like 1/3 which you don't really need the reduction on that so like you're burning through that incubator faster unless a on two K eggs which are easier to hatch but you don't want to be a sucker and buy the other incubator because for 50 more coins you can get the better one this it's like a no-win situation well there's good slow pokemons go right there it's like a no twins you cannot buy them but then what if you don't get the Worple then you don't get the work well it will be back like everything a Pokemon go it will be back you'll get it eventually like if you are the fool that says I have to have this now then you are their demographic that they're making money off of I did not the picture is cute but again like okay it's a Wurmple with a hat on it and then I don't know which evolution I'm getting anyways and the only way I can evolve can evolve well then why because of what we're both okay with it I hate the like where every poker brat is somebody's favorite Pokemon I hate that because that true no one likes cascoon and no one likes silcoon no - I like them both they're awful but they'd be better with a party about yeah yes would be an improvement that would be a significant improvement all right checking for art for party hat silcoon nothing trainers ready those incubators I'm gonna change incubators to the word money ready those monies the adventure thought is back and it's the perfect time to get your leg up on your new year's resolution during the adventure sink hatch a thon you will be rewarded with extra Stardust rare candies and you nova stones if you walk a certain distance that's if you hit the 50k i think you can find pokemon wearing party hats hatching and eggs and encountering pokemon in the wild - from thursday january 2nd to thursday january 16th you will be able to hatch Pikachu and Wurmple barring a party Picchu and Wurmple wearing a party hat in 2k eggs you will have a chance of hatching Pichu wearing a party hat from 7k eggs in 2 star raids you will have a chance to challenge Radek 8 and Wobbuffet wearing party hats in the wild Pikachu will be wearing party hats which is the same Pikachu party hat that's existed for like 3 years and if you're lucky trainers you may encounter a shinier a decayed Pikachu Pichu Wobbuffet and Wurmple all wearing party hats is the party hat SHINee know know how to say it's the same hat they went to Costco got the same man twice the hatch candy twice the Stardust hatch adventure sink for walking 50 kilometers yes so be a reward for walking 50 kilometers is 50000 start us 15 rare candy guaranteed you know of a stone but there's one thing I don't need it's more rare candy I got like 400 of those things they nerfed it they nerfed rare candy in like the last month so you get lesser candy now from raids oh not that it does something different I was like nerfing to me means it does something else I know does it not give the same amount yeah exactly things like this is not two things I have a 5 star raid in the back of my building in 25 minutes so do I care no it's Virizion still yes get it for me haven't got when you I've missed the first two we're just gonna we're just gonna miss number three because you know what Greg you're right they'll come back you know what probably come back a shiny with sacred sword so you know I'll get all three when they come back because I can't be bothered no patience is a virtue that should be their tagline yeah uh Heatran is coming back speaking of heat ran high heat ran actually let's share a sentimental moment here boys actually heat ran actually is not a cockroach okay we're having him in the moment what are we sentimentally we all got heat ran right before my wedding together we did me so y'all went to the wrong Denny's you know we went to the better Denny's I don't remember any Denny's oh I do remember you do yeah yes that actually that day of driving around Wisconsin from heat travels kind of fun it was we couldn't find like half the roads at the time cuz there's a lake in the way for for our listeners I got married last year celebrated my one-year anniversary for my bachelor's party will who was in charge of it booked like a house a cabin I don't know what to call Abbott cabin cabin out in the Wisconsin Dells so we were out there for three or four days and it was the weekend where Heatran was promoted so I'm one of the days I think it was maybe Sunday we drove we happened to see a heat ran and there was I think eight of us yeah we took two cars drove to the Heatran Tran because we were in the middle of nowhere because most hotels are also gyms and there's a lot of statues historical things in the Wisconsin Dells there's a lot of gyms but they're just spread out there on all these windy roads that you have to like drive underneath the hotel over this mountain through this tree and then you'll get to the spot there happened to be another heat transfer drove to that one and then there happened to be another heat ransom that one and a certain point we were like why are we doing like we already got one he trans not good but what we should do now is we should all book the Wisconsin Dells last minute now we should go get China he trained I mean it is less expensive in the winter that's right bring board games and I love playing board games yes we had a lot of good board game I'm that weekend too it's true I brought I brought all the good ones I brought one good one he did but it lasted for hours he's a mica [Music] okay so here's my question about this party party hat fiasco yes we've said on the show multiple times and I I think some of the pokemon go audience has finally started realizing this but we've always said this Chinese are not new content yep or air but knee antic treats them as new content yep oh you got to get out this week you can get shiny whoo dude like you gotta go they're all just shiny who do now I will I will say like Redick aid with a party hat Wobbuffet with a party hat that's new content that's another thing to add to your collection another dex entry whether or not you want the shiny I mean that depends on how much money you want to spend because those are those two are raids only but they've done this before and I don't think we've really talked about it but these specifically the adventurous ink reward is pretty good so for 50 kilometers which I rarely ever hit because I work at home unfortunately also a blessing and a curse but here doesn't work at home Greg me oh wow your loss but you get 50 I mean I could 50k start us pretty good 15 where candy guaranteed you Nova stone the thing that people are after the most so if we ignore the adding shine eases new content they're really focusing on you hatching eggs giving you a lot of 2k eggs which you can do with your free incubator if they want you to spend the money for the other eggs which that's up to you but is the adventure sync reward good enough is that like oh I can get this two weeks in a row if I walk a lot does but I guess the question is like does that make somebody who never hits the 50k dedicated to hit that 50k to get those three rewards oh it's not no no nobody's gonna go out of their way the 50k that's a lot of walking now that is a lot of walking I'm at 21 this week so in hours I just got to double that yeah just go running around a mall somewhere for a while that's a lot of it's a lot of walking I feel like they could do at least give like a 25k reward oh hey I walked sixty six point eight kilometers this week what did you go i well not usually on Saturdays I take a six or seven mile walk which I did yesterday miles to kilometers what's what's 50k in miles well a 10k is six miles so it'd be about thirty miles geez that's a lot of walking but yeah I also went to Norway house and the Americans so you're getting your get a number of times what's here once you start uh scout out where right now well where do I cease my star disk I use clearly any Pokemon that you've caught him on there's Pokemon in this game to be exact 50 K is thirty one point zero six eight six miles I have two million nine hundred and thirty two thousand three hundred and eighty eight Stardust so 50k is a drop in the bucket and what's even more astounding to me is I have 1619 EB candy what am I doing with halt oh and how many you Nova stones do you have well you bought the $10 Reggie things so you got one you know if it's done from that how do I find out how many you know put stones I have is it alright that's a new bread probably can go bottom none to right now I think I got one from the research and then I got the I had three total because I used one to evolve Chandeleur so I have two extra now I have one you Nova stone so you're getting another one this week there's pretty great yay yeah I think adventures think needs needs to go up or they need to do something more because if they want actual people like if they want me to get out of my house 50 kids a lot I mean I think the rewards are good but I feel like there should be a reward at 25k - not as good maybe not the guaranteed you know the stone but something I mean there is a reward it's just a reward yeah it's like it's like what 25 pokeballs and like five Great Falls for 25k it's not that great Wow that's you know it lets your pokeball pause it's your choice if you walk in 25k you probably don't need the 30 pokeballs popping out you're already you're already pretty dedicated to the game if you're recording 25k being of bragging about how much you've walked we do have a subreddit reddit.com slash are slash super effective and every Monday it does a post of like what was your progress in Pokemon go where you can brag about you walking I'd be curious to know we have a thousand people over our subreddit this sounds like an ad it kind of is but it's free I think there's also some people in slack that share their week in progress in Pokemon go to my weekend progress in Pokemon go was I filled up my Pokemon storage yesterday and I have also maxed out the amount of Pokemon storage I can buy so how do I have so many Pokemon oh I know I because of my rule ABC always be catching come on kids you got to always be catching so I should catch this not two in the house if you're not paying attention to the screen of Pokemon go you need to have your pokeball plus goin and press that button every time you get the buzz buzz buzz you gotta do it before we move on to our next article you guys who's committed to the bloody adventure anyone do we chain Giro % okay what do you mean to the buddy adventure are you are you are you petting your buddy everyday you walk in them you take them to new place every day well again so now that I'm back at work I have been playing with the buddy feature more because a 1/2 space for the buddy to appear and two I can I walk around so I have been taking my Rose rate out and walking a bit but again it's just like okay so I see it on the over screen every once in a while and yep speaking of Pokemon goes we should have started the show with this because this is this is some math for you guys everybody's favorite segment that we should have a match jingle 2019 year and review digital games and interactive me media this is off super data super data research calm if that sounds like a legit website yeah super data research as it were grabbing your data from our own research thanks for use accept our cookie-cookie Clayton website so what China telling us today so the report is super data's 2019 year-in-review focusing on the health of digital games an interactive media market breakout for moments of 2019 and the top trends going into 2020 digital games are up three percent year over there year generating one one hundred and twenty point 1 billion dollars in 2019 with sixty four point four billion in mobile and twenty nine point six billion in PC and fifteen point four billion in gaming consoles there's a bunch of other statistics here but let's look at the games and so you'll probably see a lot of other pokemon go blogs reference these numbers so they're coming strictly from super data that's why I skipped you know polygon or Pokemon go hub because they're just pulling from this website so this is this is the the raw the raw source here let's start with number ten let's go up numbered let me and let me know if you've heard of these uh these these are free to play games and these are their revenue in 2019 so only the money they made in 2019 they are free to play games cost you no money to download mobile I think these are all yeah these are on mobile or can't be mobile I guess well there's some exceptions here so number ten last shelter survival I think I heard of that as a strategy game one has made one point 1 billion dollars in I need to make one of these free to play games I need a pivot of dollars number nine game for piece by ten cent speaking of China it is a shooter it's made one point two billion dollars game for piece game for piece they we know ten cent they make they own the classic company supercell who makes clash royale sorry these are mobile games are just because I'm looking in my ass these are all free-to-play titles in 2019 six of them being mobile games okay because I'm in my app and there is no game for peace number eight is fate Grand order by Aniplex Inc it's an RPG made 1.2 billion dollars and Apple X they make animes and the Pollux is this okay this sounds like a gotcha game fake grand order that is one the the fate/stay series as one of the most favorited favorite people's love anime out there so yeah that's just an intellectual property that's gonna generate cash I have seen the game I have been tempted to play the game I have not jumped into playing the game because it's more than I want out of my mobile phone so but if you watched that anime you'd be playing oh you would be all over it yes yeah absolutely hey it's another gotcha game just so you know number seven is crossfire bye smile gate it's a shooter it's made one point four billion dollars in 2019 crossfire crossfire crossfire crossfire no not that crossfire number six you won't believe number one number six go buy knee antic it's an adventure game or six it's only number six one point four billion dollars in 2019 they can't hire a regular graphic artist oh I'm will not hear this I will not hear this argument again one can be excited for where garden skates is gonna be though or billion dollars cannot we still do not have socks in this game we still can't change our trainers hairstyle I was a little upset that there's not different body types to choose some for the trainer I mean honestly at this point this game has been around for so many years and made so much money can I not have a body type that is more in conformation with my vision of myself please thank you dear dear mr. Pokemon go thank you you're saying all dudes aren't the same height with the nope same structure and the same hair color and the same face yes correct number I there are all ladies number five will candy crush saga by King digital entertainment it's a puzzle game wrapping around two one point five billion dollars I gave up on that game long ago how is that still going so strong because you get to match three things probably because they have dogs they don't have socks in candy crush saga you don't know what they've upgraded to I do I know pursue plays it it done that socks I wonder if I'm up still plays it my mom was pretty addicted to candy crush oh I was - I was - and then I got to a level where it's just like there was nothing I could do without paying money and I was like I'm out and it was like level 1,500 or something my friend and plays still and rents the same thing but takes like time off it's like okay I just I'm stuck in a puzzle I'm gonna give it a rest for a bit and game comeback number for me I got it all right okay go for it Louise Angry Birds league of legends by Riot Games slash ten cent is a MOBA 1.5 billion dollars that makes sense now I'm feeling like garden escapes isn't gonna be on this list at all number three honor of kings by 10 cent also a MOBA 1.6 billion dollars the third time 10 cent is on this list ok number two is dungeon fighter online by Nexon RPG one point six billion dollars and I'm curious about this one is this in my mobile phone dungeon Fighter online as Greg look that up number one for night by epic games it's a shooter that's made 1.8 billion dollars sounds about right yep no dungeon fighter online on my phone so it has to be free-to-play somewhere else Pokemon go really uh falling behind Hey Oh Jenna fighter online is on steam i don't know one so i mean there's a lot of money between one point or in 1.8 billion man that's where forward i being the biggest game in the world and pokemon go to be like slightly below it is still super impressive that mean there's 400 million between it that's how much money there is real big whales in the pokemon go see well i think the thing that's holding pokemon go back is the fact that it's mobile only and we're getting to a point where there is more saturation of mobile phones around yes but we're also getting to a point where the free mobile phones the technology on them is not good enough to run the high-end mobile games any longer so then people are going moving over to steam which is on their pc and they have actually it's a little more affordable to keep your pc up to date with better equipment than it is to keep upgrading your phone which you can't upgrade parts of every year mm-hmm so that's you know the money is shifting away from the mobile phone market and into things like steam and pc gaming where there's it's it's actually becoming more accessible to the marketplace that's your economics talk from william our anderson bongo can't ever get that market because it requires you to be outside yeah well not only that but when your phone gets so old that it's like clunky and I mean Pokemon go has enough technology problems running on a really good phone but yeah well I mean this is just one out of millions of people but my sister is a prime example of that where she stopped playing pokemon go purely because her phone had troubles running it and she was the person that played you know every day and that went from every day to like once a week because i mean according to her words it was just it just doesn't work when she opens it well i mean i i have an iphone i don't know if i'm allowed to call it tan or x or whatever but the first that the one of that series i folks out i phone 10 and right now in this year 20 that we are in if I launched Pokemon go and in announcement that an egg is hatching happens immediately after the launch sequence the game freezes completely and I have to like force quit it and start it over again really I mean look they didn't make that much money this year yes they can't keep it updated who can't make socks can't update the game I mean I feel that there's a couple of things Pokemon go does require a better phone but doesn't require a great phone so there are a lot of options out there but I think one thing that limits them a little bit is they are held back by a larger company like when you're looking at something like fortnight port day is just responsible to themselves they can make whatever they want whenever they want Pokemon go does have a level of oversight and release schedules and stuff that they have to go through because they're working with a brand that isn't theirs so I think some of their growth is limited by the fact that they have to carefully consider a brand that they don't own and respond to those people's needs so there is a level of extra red tape for any sort of massive improvements or changes that they want to do whereas other mobile games can be much more agile in how they switch things around and I think that is a limiting factor as to how much money you can make if people get frustrated with like this is the game play and we're frustrated by it or we're frustrated by what you're presenting to us they have to respond to a larger parent company whereas other people don't I would personally put more money into Pokemon go in the in the places that doesn't feel like I'm getting ripped off so I don't like I don't mind buying storage upgrades even though I think it's kind of expensive like 2 bucks 450 so I've maxed out my storage I've maxed out my bag space because that is something that never goes away so I feel like there's value to that that is something I benefit from every day I play the game and plus I'm a hoarder but for me it's hard to put money in like incubators because they're gone and if I don't hatch what I intended that and so if I like bought you know a $2.00 incubator and I hatch three eggs and none of them were Wurmple I would be like well I don't feel like I got my money's worth because I hatched a soul Rock a soul rock and a Bulbasaur and that didn't feel like $2 worth sum so I personally stay away from that kind of stuff but like right now my big problem is I would like my trainer to look cool and I would like to purchase clothes I have no problem in games I like to purchase cosmetics because they're there and I can show them off and this new shirt makes me feel good inside and so here's your two dollars but the fact that this games made billions of billions of dollars in the last three years and if I put the $2 shirt on top of the one dollar and fifty cent pants and the belt buckle goes through the shirt it looks completely awful it's like what did I just pay for I just paid almost $4 for clothing items that look atrocious on my character without like what am I actually paying for here like that a real problem paying for clothing and stuff I don't see if you're sure because you feel good on the inside you're wearing it the wrong way a shirt supposed to make you feel good on the outs oh my bad yes quit eating your shirt Steve my big problem with specifically Pokemon go is I feel like the money I am putting into it is just like if you're gonna charge somebody two dollars for a shirt at least make it look good on the character you have one model yeah you have well you don't have different body types you don't have different heights yep why is the clothing in this game clipping each other so badly like the Pokemon themselves look great and I get that knee antic doesn't make the Pokemon models but you can't hire a base them you can't hire somebody to like really sit down and I'm sure they would probably maybe that maybe it maybe I'm wrong maybe it doesn't matter how good clothes the clothes look somebody sees that liket Tong shirt they pay the the two bucks for it they put it on it clips through the pants and they go well I already spent the two bucks who cares yep maybe maybe that's actually the core of this but if I know it's not gonna look good then why am i personally why would I pay the two dollars like I really I would I would probably buy all the clothes in the game at some point over at the time maybe buy one shirt a month and eventually catch up and have all the shirts half of them don't even look good oh my gosh it's so frustrating yeah that's true I don't even wear shoes in the game haven't worn them for years and I think my problem is it's just it's a game I play every day whether it's five minutes or an hour and so I've already invested the time so like two dollars in you know 300 hours of playing a game I like to play is is really nothing but I feel like there's just such a big disrespect to the player for them to spend money on your clothes and your clothes don't even look good after you you gave me antique the money to look good maybe write a letter to support at Niantic comm so that they can yeah I'm sure I'm free clothes sure they'll answer it in two years all right let's say one more break and we have our sword and shield news and then our Pokemon the week in the question the week so we will be right back [Music] [Music] flash with Giganta max pokemon for great prizes in ranked battles in January season Giganta max Pikachu dramatic jug into max Snorlax and more powerful

existed the last two months besides Picchu Meowth and Eevee which are very easy to get you will be matched with other players of similar rank to even the competition and the higher you finish in the season the greater the rewards are prizes include battle points ability capsules of mints and even bottle caps including golden bottle caps for top performers try to meet reach master ball rank at the end of the month to earn the best rewards to start ranked battles versus select versus in the x-men you choose battle stadium choose ranked battles press the Y button to see the current rules and regulations there are both single battles and double battles for you to participate in ranked battles in January will run through the month of January and check back later for more ranked battle season news so if you were to do the ranked the first ranked battles which took place in December and you were to make it to master ranked it doesn't matter where in master rank you make it you would have gotten 600 battle points and 3 golden bottle caps Wow which I think for me took its a tie I mean it's a time commitment for me it took I want to say about 50 battles to do I think it was like no it would might have been 60 because it was like 35 wins and 25 losses I think is what I ended up with to get to master ring how's it going now 102 wins 8 losses I think right now you can you can definitely tell there was a slight shift in meta but I'm also very very bad at battling so I was pretty proud I made its master rank but 600 battle points is very very very very good I was not expecting the three golden bottle caps which is nice they're they're really pushing the competitive it's almost like at e3 they said that they wanted to focus more on competitive and that was one of the reasons for the national dex cut and here we are where almost everyone playing competitive is extremely happy with competitive unless your name is smoked ahead I don't know about nugget bridge but I mean like smoke smoke guns always like smoke gun was never gonna be happy with this because Mogan is designed to make sure everything is as fair as possible yes whereas like the Pokemon company they understand that that doesn't exist yeah yeah exactly and some point I mean if they cared that if they cared everything was fair as possible they wouldn't make Pokemon like far fetch or Chimecho or eglee buff right like these Pokemon will never ever be competitive well I don't know actually I'd but maybe somebody has made Chimecho competitive the Pokemon company wanted things to be as fair as possible they wouldn't have let Landorus run wild for ten years I don't have a ban the gene they don't exist they didn't make it over they didn't get their passport stamp now they've been cancelled yeah I don't know if I have much to say about the competitive stuff I know if you at least participate in one battle in ranked you get 50 battle points whether you win or lose if you want an easy 50 battle points actually a hundred battle points you do one round of ranked one round of sorry one round of ranked doubles one round of ranked singles and then at the end of the season you will get a hundred battle points just for participating in both I am NOT a huge fan of singles personally so I didn't do any singles but I guess in retrospect I probably should have done one match but yeah 600 battle points for getting a master rank pretty good I don't know if that's you know good enough for you guys to participate I know will has will have you beaten the game yet no no I told you I picked it up I was all ready to get back into it and play it through and finish the game especially after my nephew shamed me because my nephews already defeated the game and he was doing battle tower or something I ain't never heard of and I went and I was stepped out onto Route 9 and there was a little I was on the bridge and there was a little bubbly fish the whole thing and I was like well let me fish for something cool and new and I fished and I fished and I fished and the exclamation point came up and out popped in octillery and I said you know what that's why I don't want to play this game and they killed the octillery it walked back to the Pokemon Center and shame and put the game away for a couple more weeks you have the weirdest requirements I just want new Pokemon with a grass there's like a ton No ok I walked over to the grass and what was what was there there was a Marini walking around there was a gastro Don working around there's some other water dude and like first off this is an ice route why are there water pokemon walking around on an ice road why is there grass on a nice route whatever well I'll ignore that but then there's Kramer and over there dr.nader Pokemon why are the water pokemon walking around they need to be in the water I was standing on that little riverbank and saw a little man teen or something poked its head up I don't know what they'd said but I could see it in the water they could put the water pokemon in the water Morini is not supposed to be walking around in the grass no I not because it gets dried out and crusty it's right over there the water is right over there if it is take a dip no it's but it's like you ice not to hold it what's gets cold but there aren't really is a Marinis of tropical water pokemon I did did you battle Pierce who's Pierce ok the one that you wanted to grab the one that you wanted to pop up is the oculus is the one that is most common to pull you just got the second most common you didn't you didn't like clappa puss I think I don't have a cob of Puss why do I get because I saw an octillery I didn't see a croctopus' okay forty percent and the second that bride's on the back of the other dragon it's like two dragons the dragon Paul yeah no yeah tiffany has one and we were doing reads and I saw hers and I was like I want one of those right well playing the game then the number one Pokemon used in competitive battles right now well well it's really good it's real fast it's very fast I also want the dragon that looks like dragalge but isn't trig algae and I also want a poltergeist because dragon that looks like drag algae I think it's called a eternalists something like that is that a dragon it is a dragon yeah I thank you honey I mean it's supposed to look like a skeleton of a dragon so yeah yeah why me and dragalge looks kind of go off I mean if you if you can get get to the final city you'll get yourself two eternities yep they exist I will get there eventually someday maybe I'll finish it tomorrow night so any in your in your in your hate of Pokemon sword and Pokemon shield it's not hate its disappointment there was a I guess we'll call it a new year's event even though the Pokemon company really doesn't like to say those Christmas events or Thanksgiving events or New Year's events Pokemon girl is also very good at saying this they will always they will always dance around said event but more shiny more shiny Magikarp briefly appear in Pokemon sword in Pokemon shield in max raid battles this is December 31st off pokemon.com be on the lookout for Pokemon dens in Galler wild area that may contain shiny Magikarp kick off the new year with more Magikarp appearing in Pokemon dens for a limited time the Magikarp you will encounter very limited time the Magikarp you will encounter in max raid battles will also have a much higher chance than normal of being shiny don't miss your opportunity to battle and catch the special Pokemon to take advantage of these better odds and max raid battles you will need to connect to your Nintendo switch system to the internet then you will see a pillar of light shining from a Pokemon den in the wild area you can walk up to a Pokemon den to interact with you max for a battle with a dino max Pokemon your chances of countering more shiny pokemon in Pokemon dens will last from December 31st to January 3rd so grab some friends and head out to the wild area alright can I just a little bit more on my problems with sword and shield sure new year's day I had my friends over for New Year's dinner my mom made a nice little pot roast and afterwards were like well let's do some Pokemon raids together and I was like you know what friends it's the shiny Magikarp event let's go find some shiny Magikarp because that's a fun thing that we as friends can do together so I hop on I have my switch connected to my big old TV that Steve forced me to buy that cost a million dollars sure ultra-high resolution that just makes Pokemon look really really bad when you ultra shiny TV ultra yep and I like literally the first den that I went to was a Magikarp den and I was like okay friends join me look we'll do local play because neither one of you are subscribers to Nintendo online service this is an this is my boy to me but okay continue and they they started up the game and they're there we're all looking we're on our why menu and it's like well where's the stamp will there's no stamp we can't see the raid and like we tried it and tried it and I'm texting you and Greg and tried it and then like my Trevor started up a den battle and like we all saw that stamp come up we joined in I got a what says spinning dude hitmontop and like Tiffany started up a max raid battle and we all were able but like whenever I tried to do the Magikarp nobody could do it well why because since they're not Nintendo online subscribers they can't see it at all even though I could see it and they were literally in my house with me why couldn't there have been a message up on the screen that said you guys can't join this raid battle rather than me wasting 45 minutes of my life not knowing that was the reason why they couldn't see it like one error message error messages like the most popular thing for computer programmers to program they love making error messages all I had to be was like your friends can't join sorry rather than me like having to text you and Greg like and then like two hours later find oh that's the reason why we couldn't see it I don't necessarily think you need Nintendo online or the Magikarp to appear but you do need Nintendo online to play with other people online I think in your instance we were doing local local but they never connected to Nintendo online to then tell the server that these are special raids yeah so the way they would have been able to connect a Nintendo online to get that server push because this is the we're going to talk about the the interesting thing here they would have had to either like update and share their trainer card or even more sent or or go into vs. or even more simply like just go into the wild area news on her mystery gift and by connecting the wild area news it would have pushed the server update even without Nintendo Online correct well I wish I had known that so I think that is the the problem because specifically in the the Pokemon article it doesn't say you need an attendant online but it says to take advantage of these raids you need to connect your Nintendo online system to the internet so by going to mystery gift and then going to wild area news that does temporarily connect you to the Internet which i think is what they needed to do I don't think they specifically needed Nintendo online but also like I said another way you could do that is by like updating your trainer card and then hitting with share button I think that connects you but okay so before we get to the Magikarp stuff it is I feel like if you're committing to a Pokemon game and I I don't know any of everyone I look as a twitch streamer I I could definitely relate to the people's wallets and how sometimes money is tight but I feel like if you're going all-in on a Pokemon game I feel like Nintendo online it's just part of that that that journey you're doing together these folks that aren't going all-in that's that's the thing they only were playing Pokemon because I was playing Pokemon if I hadn't said let's do raid battles together they wouldn't be playing Pokemon did they buy the games themselves yep they played through finish the game and done okay I mean yeah I guess those exist like I just think of it like I just think of like you just think of it like I mean back in the day like yeah it's I guess it sucks that like you have to pay $25 a year but also when you're buying a 16-5 I had like $25 a years I realize it but I also have friends who are like I don't like to do any kind of subscriptions at all they don't they don't want to ever do subscription services no matter what the cost is or any what the benefit they just hate the fact that it's a subscription yeah I just think of red and blue of like that's getting a link cable it's like 15 bucks I mean if it was the Nintendo brand Italy cable I think it was 20 bucks I was like you needed a link cable to trade I mean I hate the argument of like well trading always used to be free no red and blue is not free it was $20 and let me tell you it was very very very hard to convince my mom to spend $20 on a link cable because she was like you're never going to use it she might have been right I might have only traded like twice and yeah I guess your friend could Medellin cable but uh it was never it was never free to trade and it is technically you could trade for free and sword and shield if you are in the same room as somebody else I just it's kind of shocking to me that I guess now that you've explained they beat the Elite Four they're done with the game that is a lot of Pokemon people to do that to just okay I'm done playing the game I'm moving on to different games but I I it seems this is the second promoted of or okay so if we don't count the Giganta back stuff it's ignore all that this is the second promoted event that isn't a gigantic so they did the delibird stuff back around Christmas they made delibird spawn everywhere same same same concept you have to connect to the wild area news get the delibird push delibird gave better rewards I gave a lot of candy yeah give desti knots this Magikarp gave a bunch of nuggets so is so this is like I guess the conversation I want to move to is even if you were like why I don't need magic er I don't want a battle Magikarp I don't need Magikarp if you're still playing the game this is like V this is the best time to money ratio you probably could have gotten of I'm gonna do this magic or parade with friends and even though I don't need the Magikarp the amount of rewards you're getting I feel like is respectful of your time yes I agree even though I ended up leaving this event with nine shiny Magikarp and anyone could have looked at me and said why do you need a knight in shining Magikarp I don't I I I'm not gonna you know apply for a job one day and write down that I got nine tiny Magikarp like it's not beneficial to me at all the rewards that I was doing and the fun I was having was a thousand percent worth it like it was just so fun to keep finding Magikarp with other people and those people getting excited and they're not getting excited and it is always fun to be like oh this one shiny cool but like who can't like it like got to good enough sweet give one one will say as Magikarp one will be Gyarados but man need about the amount of nuggets I got was just like this is awesome I could I could do this forever and granted it was four days but I think that was a good amount of time to I think even two days would have been good I think maybe more than four days might have fell a little bit drawn-out because it does push other raids away if they if they continued to do stuff like this I think it does then add value and maybe your two friends would reconsider of like is the $25 a year worth it to them if once a month they can participate in what seems to be I don't know I don't know the easiest way to compare it to maybe like a community today of hey let's come a we we be delayed for we we saw the credits we're moving on to different games but once a month for three days we can play with our friends come back to Pokemon do these magikarps do these deli birds do whatever else they have planned this games not even two months old and they've already done two promoted non GMAX events and then maybe they decide to get into competitive they decide to finish their pokedex they decide to maybe actually try to explore the wild like I think this is what we've always wanted in Pokemon games and they're actually finally delivering that and I feel like that conversation has been lost to people because they're like oh a shiny Magikarp which is like cool I don't but like the cooler thing is we're seeing these events now in the game I mean I think so but it may be too little too late since people don't expect this kind of stuff they're not looking for it to happen and even though it's happening they're not gonna participate because they just don't expect it you don't think those same friends now that they've seen that there's a shiny Magikarp and unfortunately it doesn't seem like they were able to compete if there was another I don't know animes debuting so SHINee knocked out only only if I was sitting there and said hey there's this shiny event they won't even know about it they won't even know interesting I feel like that's so I know three people who have never played Pokemon heavily before who are very much into sword and shield and the post game and are like still playing it and get very excited for these events I think it's hitting more people than we think because there's something about the switch that has changed things for a lot of people I know but it's just your traditional video game player wants to get to the credits and be done yura and even a lot of people who just picked up sword and shield because they know Pokemon games are generally a good experience they get to the credits and they're not paying attention to the Pokemon news anymore there they do they just don't want to do it anymore and this is this is what Masuda and other higher and game freak people have said this is why I like the battle frontier didn't make it an Omega Ruby alpha sapphire they completely know that most players get to the credits may move on and so it's hard to spend so much time developing a vast postgame that the majority of their audience is not going to play and that they need to promote that post game more like before the game is sold so that people who are these kinds of I think if you went into it I think the mine is I don't think they did this for delibird but I think for specifically for the Magikarp it popped up in the my Nintendo news so they pushed it to all switch owners in the - had no news that there was a Magikarp event goes into my I mean don't you yeah but like I'm how he just shoves up on the side every time I go I'm just saying like how how else do you promote this event I mean they had they tweeted about it it's on Pokemon comm calls from China I might as well get them from Nintendo I also think they did something very different with this game as they introduced what is the postgame early like the wild area is the third thing you hit and so there is there is that breadcrumb because you go back to it a number of times and every time you go back to it new things happen and at the end of postgame be like hey things have changed there and you can go to more places so I think I don't know what more they could do for bread crumbing to get people to go back there to see these events like they did a really good job in promoting this wild area as being the post game throughout the entire game I I don't know what they could do to better promote that they're doing something special like I saw it but I I don't know I think this is the first game where they're actively taking steps to say there is a much bigger post game yeah and it just might take time I think I think we'll you're making excellent points of like if somebody beat the game saw credits they put away the game how do you communicate to them to come back to the game are they following Pokemon on Twitter are they following Pokemon on Facebook do they go to Pokemon comm spoiler for that one no one goes to Pokemon comm they're always have people are always shocked that we weaken to continue to pull news for Pokemon calm every single week they're a really good resource they might not be the fastest resource no Pokemon comm is a really good resource of what's happening in sword and shield right now they pushed it to all switch owners whether or not they check the mine attend no news I don't but I do know it's there so like I don't know how else you communicate to people that an event is going on and while the delibird event might have passed a lot of people in radar I think this event was a little bit more effective but I don't know if it was more effective because they increase the shiny ads for Magikarp I calculated them myself because I happen to stream on Twitch and because uh you know 200 people were watching me and they were also doing these raids I said hey before you leave from the night before you say goodbye let me know how many raids you did let me know how many were shiny collected all that data and I got about 12% of the raids were shiny now obviously there was a flaw in that because it was possible that me and Greg could have done a raid together we both got shiny reaper reported back so I figured that number was a little bit higher I then reached out to Joe to Sarah be talk to Joe and he said that he could actually see it in the code whatever that means I have a I disagreed with Joe on a lot of things but apparently in the code it said that the shiny Magikarp were 8% which does come to a 1 in 12 chance if one in 12.5 chance so one out of 12.5 raids would have gotten you a shiny Magikarp which is higher than community odds which is 1 in 25 I guess raids do technically take longer to do than just tapping on a Magikarp in Pokemon go and running away you can't run away from a raid I think that's a good amount think that's not low enough not high enough I think that's a good amount where people were like oh my gosh is Magikarp assignee and again going back to the first conversation even if it wasn't shiny it's still worth your time because the rewards were so good I got a shiny on my first one so it was worth it enough for me it's awesome and I think I think it does prove well not that it needs to be proven I think like it doesn't matter what shiny odds are it doesn't matter if it's 1 in 8,000 or if it's 1 in 5 I think going into a raid and being like oh my gosh this is shiny is pretty fun every time I think that's why Community Day works who cares if the odds are 1 in 25 and they're there they're not as special because the hundreds of thousands of people I played community with in the last three years they're still excited every time that that pokemons a different color and the sparkles appear every single time they're still excited I'm excited because it's like aha one less that I have to care about so the other thing that I think is interesting is that this game is yet to have an update if we look at the history of x and y's Sun and Moon ultra Sun an ultra moon a lots ago Pikachu they all received updates in January whether or not this game will get an update in January unsure there seems to be a lot of things they need to fix yeah I think sucker-punch is broken competitively there's a couple spots in the wild area where no music plays at all I don't know if that's intentional or not the game at least for me has crashed three times in the last two months where I can't think of other Pokemon games that have crashed I mean there there's a couple issues but some people specifically Joe thinks the shiny odds are broken for the the catching slash knocking out method although we don't know because we had this conversation a week ago we only have one person data mining the code and sharing it to Joe and they've been wrong multiple times in the past especially about how people for the first two weeks thought you had to combo and then Pokemon calm said there are no combos except for chain fishing which doesn't lead to shiny pokemon only with some brilliant Pokemon the interesting thing here with the magic carps are they wear all the the square shinies and normally in raids because they're static encounters that raids are the same as Masuda and the same as tree and the same as any static encounter in the game where it's 15 out of 16 chance of being stars 1 out of 16 chances of being squares not only without pushing an update to the game server side they were able to change raids to Magikarp which have them before with Ellie Burton stuff they changed it to Magikarp they changed the rewards they changed the shields which I don't think a lot of people noticed so if you were in a 5-star Magikarp you had a you had a 5-star shield but if it was a 5-star shiny Magikarp it was actually a six it was actually six shields the shiny Magikarp hadn't extra shield in a five star raid which is interesting unless I'm wrong on that but that was something I noticed and then the third thing was they forced all of those magikarps to be squared shinies and not the star shinies for whatever that's worth it's worth nothing spoiler but they they seem to have a lot of control on what they can do when they push it out obviously that makes sense I don't think about like any any of those three things the extra shield the rewards the the type of shiny was an accident okay question of the week this better be good I've seen as musical twice this week I know ready ask me it's so easy to quiz me on my knowledge of all things around Pokemon if you ask me you'll find out what my answer is to the question of the we standing ovation standing of it beautiful not a dry eye in the house I'd even do the key change yet find it make it happen this is from Lance from our attic channel in slack we actually touched on this earlier do you think we'll see voice acting in the series in its life on the switch Fire Emblem got a lot of praise for being fully voice acted which may be influential for a game for a while I'm ok mmm free computers on drum so would you want full voice acting or just minimal character grunts or phrases like masters does I'm trying to think of what game I played that has full voice acting but when you hit a it skips to the next thing like I would like full voice acting as long as there is a way to also like oh Final Fantasy 14 does that where they'll start the speech but if you've read it faster you can hit a and it skips to the next section that's the kind of voice acting I would like but yes I would like voice acting in my games although I do tend to play them with sound off but I didn't this time cuz I had it on the big TV so yeah I'm back to having voice acting I went all around all around the world of I'm back voice acting yes and and I would say I would I would like voice acting but they don't even have enough room to put all the pokemons oh yeah a bunch of audio recordings movie bringing that up who knew that road will turn into a national Dexter over the last because he wants to find things to hate about the game this is Audrina Nicole my heart is a block of ice you got that right well I would like to see more of a master style thing personally I wouldn't I wouldn't hate it if everything was fully voice-acted but I think the I think the Masters stuff is is really effective is it super effective let's not get carried away here will give us our pokemon of the week well the last week's pokemon of the week Oh what were those horrible horrible clues had something to do with me being a kid in Hawaii and Firefox I don't know um well because it was related to you the typing of a fire fireworks Pokemon but it wasn't the fireworks Pokemon because I had already done that one this has the typing of this the week's Pokemon it's pre evolution doesn't have any equal typing to it so it's a completely new set of typing and you could only get it very recently even though I didn't say this but it's pre evolution has been around since the first games but this Pokemon you could only get recently so who's that Pokemon it's chocolate Wow not in generation 1 it's a lowland marowak a lowland marowak you are correct the fire ghosts or ghost fire I don't know which one it was exactly fire ghost it is fire Christian chandelure which I said was its cousin his ghost fire yes so there's the difference and it's also weird that it can learn flame wheel hex and shadow bone before level 28 but it doesn't evolve into a little marowak until level 8 so it's like you guess gotta use the Move remember for those ones even though it never learned them in the first place here's some useless trivia a lowland marowak weevil porygon zr the same weight as dawn watch hey bola pedia coming through strong here really how how light is dawn uh 75 pounds okay ten-year-old girl normally weighs 75 pounds I don't know ten-year-old girls come in all shapes and sizes not according to yellow and marowak is the only dual type pokemon that shares no types with its pre evolution Moo fancy though a lowland marowak shares the ability to rock head with hugh bone a cuban with rock head cannot evolve into a lowland marowak with the same ability as rock head is cubans first ability and a lowland marowak's hidden ability huh that Scheffel sprites real good though perfect it is the ads good it's good we need both sprites are good pokemon Lola of a Lola marowak wasn't shuffle yeah yeah everything up to Mar shadow was in shuffle on shuffle too soon we need shuffle too so we can get sprites oh yeah yeah oh come on I need that rammer and shuffle with or without Pikachu all three of you have to have Pikachu Eric Kudo okay you gotta have all of them it make sense what's the next week's Pokemon well you thought that Greg's question of the week song would be your only reference to a particular film but you would be thinking wrong I was also inspired by [Laughter] that particular film for this week's Pokemon of the week so fasten your seat belts kids strapped in if I can do this without laughing that would be a miracle what's your typical choice Jellico Pokemon oh this let me stare at the burger could the beautiful Burger King sign like the moon in the sky the gem in the matter of finding our Pokemon creatures particular aspects we must keep we must reconcile their name their species abilities quite surely but also the route where they domicile nu Nova on 4 and 18 if you're lucky you'll see this week's eating a yeah Papa berry in Kalos in hordes on route 5 there are many practicing to intimidate to appear very scary on our return to Hoenn we travelled quite far to 113 and then we must look very closely this week's Pokemon can only be found if it peeks out its head perhaps to be nosy while visiting a Lola are her first trip no dice yet on our return without too much luck we discovered some boys before the red meadow and some girls near the town with a broken-down truck grand gala with its castles its curries its camps appears to have two routes we can place the mystery pokémon Stoke outskirts is one and Galler mine number two it does grace one last bit of advice if you would be so keen to find a species member with the ability stated travel to the wild area peer into a den it is in a max raid you'll be quite elated actually the last line if if it's in a max raid you'll be quite elated but goodness my microphone got in the way oh so hard to write that five minutes before we started recording I guess I was taking a nap there you go alright well we will be back next week of course boo Greg is on Twitter at white-winged I am on Twitter at dragging a lake whale is at wash in the sink I said the reddit earlier reddit.com slash are slash super effective it'll be in the show notes as well yeah I guess well
