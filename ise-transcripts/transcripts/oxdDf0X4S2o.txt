Oh what's up everyone welcome to the 220 fourth episode of the Pokemon podcast I'm your host SBJ and with me is will good afternoon we are in a non-traditional recording time once again once it's it's been a crazy couple weeks I feel although we've been getting the episodes out consistently so that's all that matters that's what's important to you that it is important to me it's important to me to deliver on a weekly basis of Pokemon goodness in people's ears this episode is probably gonna be pretty pokemon go heavy but before we get to that will how's your weekend my weekends barely existed how does mean how's your week how's your light how's your life well I mean they released the Destiny year two moments of triumph and I realized how sorry of a human being I am when I pulled mine up and I only have one out of what is eight or six eight I think yes I only have one out of the eight done so i have to bust myself to get the other seven done that's what i was doing last night oh man I I had the opposite i logged in picked up my book and they were all done strangely enough like the year one moment of triumph was like that for me but year too not so much yeah I think the only thing you had left for your one was skull loss yeah prison of elders dealio yeah and now there's a lot of things about destiny that I don't understand anymore but collecting calcium fragments are good quitted though they're calcified fragments calcified yeah at that I understand because I have an app on my phone that tells me exactly where to go awesome yeah that didn't exist back when I was searching for the moment I watched like 50 individual youtube videos that walked you to each one and yeah that was a pain so how was your week been it's been good it's been super busy super weird it's weird yeah i would say that july is more of a chill month for me is this is this a known app month or our naps allowed in July ah I haven't napped in a while actually I take that back I took a nap last night because I was purposely trying to throw off my sleep schedule and that's why twice I got home did some stuff slept from like 8pm to 10pm and then i stayed up till 5am then i slept through about 11 so I could go to sleep earlier tonight because I have to catch a flight tomorrow which is part of the weirdness of if you were to ask me Thursday what I would have been doing this weekend I would have told you that this is my first weekend in like five weeks that I'm actually going to be home I'm gonna do nothing I did all my yard work early i started cleaning like this was going to be my weekend where i was going to do nothing except ketchup on nothing and thursday dramatically changed and i made some phone calls got some phone calls and now i'm flying out to atlanta on sunday tomorrow hopefully the episode will be live i'm going to cut and edit it and publish it at the same time and then meeting with some people recording some stuff and then flying back on tuesday and that all happened within like a two hour time span of going from am doing nothing this weekend too I'm flying out to Atlanta and I've never been to Atlanta and yeah so it's just a crazy week and then on top of that this can kind of bring us into Pokemon news here I got an email from pax West last night which is who they formerly called pax prime but I think PAX East is bigger than pax prime so they named it packs West at it the one in Seattle the packs in Seattle so I got an email last night that my panel which is just a Pokemon panel got accepted and so I guess on like September second I'm going to be flying out to seattle to speak and yeah that was also super unexpected and i've never been to Atlanta I've never been to Seattle I actually don't fly a lot first time I flown was when I went two worlds I think yeah yeah that was what 2010-2011 2011-2012 I think that was the first time you were ever in an airplane for years ago and look at you now the commitment of day Jet Center yeah so what was funny as earlier in the week I was planning to visit you in DC because Irene is Irene wants the good old white house she wants to do all the she wants to do the deed did the DC tour whatever people go to DC for I'm sure you see where I leave DC yes it would be a good idea to get it in I'm sure there are plenty of tourists in DC I don't know if you can spot them as easily as other normal people but it's it's very easy to spot them because they're not in my neighborhood so typically when you go out of my neighborhood then you say oh look there's a tourist I'm assuming they have the they they're probably they probably look like they're playing pokemon go but instead they're just taking pictures of everything in DC yeah uh yeah so I was trying to plan a DC trip at the end of august so if this all works out well obviously this week I'm working out because I already booked my flight and hotel and I don't think I'm getting that money back so I'm going to atl this week Hotlanta Hotlanta folio yeah I'm staying downtown i already had a fan or two messaged me asking if we could get lunch which is cool then the end of alt and then at the end of july the beginning of august i'm going to gencon meeting meeting up with you and logan and jeff and i think travis said he's coming and Greg and I'm forgetting people and I apologize and then after that I at the end of august i'm supposed to be going to Washington DC and like two days after I get back from DC I'm supposed to now go to Seattle I don't know how I'm gonna stay employed really yeah just work remotely yeah i mean i could I the seattle one works out actually really well because it's it's a friday saturday sunday monday convention and mondays labor day so i can actually go to work on friday fly out saturday morning because my i wouldn't be able to check into hotel until 3pm anyways do the saturday do full day Sunday and then I speak on Monday and then I only actually have to take one day off which is tuesday and then i'll use that day to fly back so that one actually works out pretty well and then the white house where the DC one is weird because that's just dependent on when i'm allowed to do a white house tour whatnot so and i'm staying with you so i don't have to worry about a hotel it's just flexible with the plane you know what's gonna happen is you're gonna stay with me for one night and then you're gonna have to worry about a hotel once you see what my house is all I man when I walk in I hope there's like a vacuum right away ready good to go and let you keep it vacuum by the front door so you're already in luck on that front let's drop the bags off start vacuuming start cleaning no it's really the mold remediation that you need to get involved with I your glove window is back here you have a you have loved window yo has come back to visit you are correct why why why what happened to your windows were they broken did they not install them properly no the original glove window was on the back side of the building the new glove window is on the front side of ok they've rotated the root yes i see i see so yeah i'm going to be at PAX west if you are going I know tickets for packs are already sold out but I would would love to meet up with you guys and there were some people in our site community saying they wanted to go to pax but it was sold out I would love to even you know meet you guys outside of pax whether that's at you know a restaurant or a library or I'd not a library because those are really existing or whatever there is to do in seattle I'll figure it out I'll vigor and hug closer closer to that date if there is a buffalo wild wings in Seattle you'll be fine yeah that would be a great place to meet let's talk about some Pokemon news so as of right now we're recording at about 4pm central time on saturday it looks like the pokemon go servers are down we'll get we'll get more into that I've been doing a side Siri with with just reporting day by day by day and Pokemon go I think the the news that kind of got overshadowed this week was a new Pokemon was revealed that was revealed on Thursday morning which was Sal and it some way to eat something like that I think it's supposed to be like salamander and bandit bandit Oh is Sosa landed yeah there you that I thought about this do you know how harshly I was criticized for my pronunciation of bones Lee bones bonsly bonsly is what somebody told me bouncing I think it is why bond sly cuz i had a bonsai tree ah bones yeah yeah yeah so we'll go whistle and it and make that the official pronunciation immediately alright yeah I'm feeling good about this name so Landon is the first-ever poisoned fire-type pokemon that will invade the Aloha region I got that right as Selanne did is also the first poison-type pokemon revealed for the Aloha region and it is the second fire-type pokemon to be shown besides Lytton it looks like so Landon has a new poison type attack but I don't think that it's hack was named the the special thing about solana though it is it has an ability which lets it poison any type of Pokemon including other poison-type pokemon and steel type pok√©mon I think those are the main two that are immune yeah those are the only two that are immune and yes its ability is corrosion and with that it can it can poison um well yeah it's poison types of Steel types and then the question is if there's something else that's preventing poison damage whether it can also affect those I don't know if there's anything out there that prevents poison oh well yeah what's his name nuttin ko olina koala koala I was going to say the one I when I saw the ability I saw what it did the first thing I thought of was welcome Allah's ability is it can't take any status effect because of its always asleep so how does that work yeah I don't think they showed anything in regards to that they showed cyl and it fighting a zubat and fighting a skarmory and a rock rough still a good name hey but and then also that you know I good oh I'll never get his name right Nicaragua Kamala why is that so hard for me I'm rubbing off on you that's why oh that is such a horrifying thought um but anyways Topo Gigio you know his ability is ready mix the oil I was like what is a topo gigio if that little it's the pikachu no no no the the mystical the guardian of meili meili island tipo kuru kuru tobacker ooh oh you mean the like the Guardian thing yeah okay so his ability creates electric terrain which prevents sleep so does that mean that Kamala can have no status conditions I don't know circumstance are they like pitching this generation is like a status heavy ability heavy i don't know maybe maybe I got a pokedex entry 4 cyl andit cyl and it emits a toxic gas together with flames from the base of its tail the poisonous gas has a sweet smell and anyone who unknowingly breathes it in will become dizzy soul and it is not a very powerful pokemon but its cunning nature allows it to battle fiercely by throwing its opponents off balance i was going to say i will say that there are quite a few geckos in hawaii so this is going to be kind of like a gecko Pokemon there you go yeah yeah I also have saline and females not only release toxic gases they can also emit pheromones that attract males of all species including both humans and Pokemon inhaling these pheromones may cause opponents to be controlled by Selanne its will I like just I have to like take a second to pronounce it because it doesn't roll off the tongue that easy yes so that's the new pokemon that was shown I don't know if that was to not like to not take away news from Pokemon go but to also just remind people when Pokemon go hits that there is new Pokemon and a new game coming here's a here's like a little taste of that oh I just realized his head like it's a darker color and it has it two ears coming out and it's kind of like it's wearing a mask and it's tied in the back oh I love Pokemon was it that it's existed for like a decade and I was like oh that Pokemon has a tail I never noticed that in 10 names like clefairy we got yet we got some news about Pokemon go besides it not working the antic puts Pokemon goal goes international roll out on hold following me much anticipated launch of Pokemon go which was supposed to be a worldwide release for my understanding it was released first in Australia then New Zealand and then the United States Pokemon goes popularity did not come as much of a surprise knee antics servers however took a very heavy hit significant number of fans had connectivity issues as a result along with logging into their pokemon trainer club accounts the company acknowledged the issue they are still working hard to fix the servers speaking of recent events knee antics CEO John Hanke told Business Insider that their team is hard at work and admit the heavy server load the international rollout of Pokemon go four countries including the United Kingdom and the Netherlands among others will temporarily be put on hold until the company feels comfortable in addition to Japan Pokemon go has been confirmed to make its way to South America Canada and Europe I can totally understand and I get the frustration for UK or Canada or South America or wherever poke is not it's frustrating that this game is out and you guys can't get it but at the same time even if they did roll it out at this point you wouldn't be able to log in you would have the same frustrations everyone else is having of trying to log in and try and trying to play the game and adding more people right now was not the proper solution yeah i was able to get in this morning though after because i was able to get in the first morning and then never get in again and then i was able to get in again this morning so they probably have done something to improve the at least the logins if not the account creation stuff yeah yeah and I have a friend in the UK who was able to install it this afternoon so they may have gotten to the point where the UK has now I know those people are probably side loading from what I saw there's normal up there like getting it from the US store or something like that right yeah you can make a u.s. account or you can sideload it I will talk more about put my go in our main topic here put one TV app now available on Apple TV pokemon TV app lets you watch different seasons of the pokemon anime and the selections change every week it is already a vet available in the App Store on iOS it's available on google play android chromecast amazon the fire TV stick and roku channels it is now on the apple TV if if that is your preferred viewing device other Britain news here is shiny gengar codes to be distributed in Japan via 711 codes to obtain shiny gengar will be available at seven spot at 7-eleven stores in Japan from July 9th through the 15th it is based on the gengar used by Jarvis in the

level 50 will hold a gang grenade and it will know though it moves mean look hypnosis cake and hyper beam think that's all the pokemon news yes that's all I've heard about I can't think of anything else come out I can't think Oh jolteon watch there are now jolteon pins in the pok√©mon center store ah finally finally jolteon watch came to a sudden end this past week you can get I think it's jolteon I'm flareon come together in a set for fifteen dollars they added a bunch of new pins let me pull it up here you can get a Magikarp magic harp and Gyarados no they've already had that I'll here are the new ones oh my knight in kabuto jolteon and flareon venusaur Charizard Blastoise IV sir Charmeleon Wartortle or Picchu and togepi the two packs are 1299 the three packs are 1899 and it looks like now we're just missing we have all gen 1 Eevee evolutions in pinpin form for those diehard EV collectors so they'll probably have like an umbreon and espeon soon yeah that's what I would assume I would act i would assume be how they come together do is we'll take a quick break and then when we come back we will go more in depth with Pokemon go and we are back let's talk about some Pokemon go I think I had another news article I have a complied in the news section and you said there's no more news and now you're like there's more news no I mean this is it's it's more of an opinion piece then then news but before we get to that I think I'm sure our listeners I've heard my thoughts so far on Pokemon go but uh let's let's hear your thoughts you you said you played for a bit I mean I've enjoyed it a little i'm not gonna be one of those people like it's like super intense about collecting catching them all and etc and like trying to do everything that's in there but i'll play it like I play most casual games like you know you're right like I still play pokemon pick cross every day right I have put zero dollars into it and all I do is I go in and I do the daily puzzle and get my 11 pick rights out of that and then like if I can pay for something I pay for something using pick rights if I can't pay for something I close it and I like well I'll come back the next day so I'll do the same with Pokemon go because there's I think six pokey stops on the my normal walk that I take my dog every morning I'll just go through pick up my pokeballs from the pokeball pokey stops and if there's any Pokemon along the way I'll try to catch them which is very hard to do when you're walking a dog but I'm getting better at it and yeah i mean III got most excited I was walking down Pennsylvania Avenue and there was an execute and I was able to catch that it was kind of in the middle of the road of pennsylvania avenue but still i was able to get it there seemed even on day one there seemed to be a lot of red team Jim's like already taken which I don't understand how that happened because I'm literally like within hours of of the game being launched there were a lot of red team gems and the gyms I've noticed are in you know DC while you don't know yet but DC has a lot of traffic circles those traffic circles have statues in them so they're in those kinds of spaces and then I noticed the fannie mae headquarters is a gym and my gym where I exercise is a gym which I that seemed really weird to me I have a funeral home near me that the gym at well like how did they pick those but then I look like an American University which is close by to my house relatively doesn't have like any gym on it so I ask away no idea and and I also have like the Sidwell Friends high school across the street from me and that's now I've given up people about people enough information are gonna by how you you could it could it could have been server issues cuz when i got to work and I loaded up I was like why is there no poki stuff and I I work not in the middle of nowhere but it's it's a very small city off off the highway oh no trust me it's the middle of nowhere I seen you on find my friends and I was like why how is her no poki stops or gyms here when i got to work and then later that day when the servers actually came up and i refreshed they did fill in because there's a post office near me and that was a that was a pokey stop and there was actually a park and not a police station and one of those i can't remember which one was it was a gym and maybe maybe you're just having server issues at that time because most public buildings should be something whether it's like a post office or police station like they should be either a gym or a pokey stop and if it's like a statue or a monument those should also be pokey stops so I'm also like confused and somebody can probably let us know on this one so there are a lot of statues in my neighborhood I live in a historic neighborhood and the statues that have been here since it before because it became historic how would you do I don't know whatever there's statues they're all over the place and all of them are pokey stops yes oh that's cool but somebody gave the statues names when they don't have official names they're all like mermaids and somebody like went through and gave them but who gave them names because one of them gave them a name with a question mark because they didn't understand what the statue was supposed to be I don't know where that's coming from because that's all pulling from like a Google database cuz but who went on Google and said I can't tell if this is a statue of a mermaid or the Statue of Liberty ah doesn't look like the Statue of Liberty frere are certain levels of like Google permission where you can like edit and help maps like in ways which is owned by Google that you can be like certain editor levels so you can like layout that like this is the City of Milwaukee but this is milwaukee county and then this is the city of New Berlin like you can map that on Google of maps and like update it for ways or other apps so I'm assuming at some point somebody was going through and like naming them because they had like they had developer access or not developer access but map creation access no one ever went and updated it I'm also assuming that it's pulling the same exact and a lot of data that ingress already laid for I don't know if a lot of people know this but when ingress was made it was it was one of the reasons it got made and one of the reasons behind it was to help map like parks and in other places that cars couldn't go and it says that in the terms and conditions when you sign up it says that it will use your data to make to like flesh out maps more that we're obviously you can't take a Google car through Central Park so you need somebody to walk through Central Park and grab those data points all right so speaking of parks that's another weird thing which is probably coming from the same source and along those lines but it was like really funny to me so I live inside of a national park so like around the edges of where I live it's basically the difference between washington DC owned land and federal government owned land so about every I'd say 20 or 30 feet on that border there's a metal stick in the ground that says a u.s. national territory just so that you know like if you cross this line the DC laws don't apply anymore it's federal laws whatever to keep it whether it's it's the most idiotic thing but somebody turned one of those sticks into app okay stop haha oh it's literally a metal stick in the ground and then they called the pokey stop like national park boundary and like but the whole edge of our neighborhood is our national park boundary obviously we have assuming all those pokey stop points are just points pulled from ingress all right i mean i guess so you ingress folks have some weird cuz i mean we could then have like maybe like 100 puppy stops of each stick was a poke a stop one yeah yeah I always had the the understanding that sometimes people playing ingress they would do things that would break the law whether that's trespassing or you know just stuff like that nothing serious but you know you shouldn't be at a in a park at two in the morning because technically the park is closed in the park is owned by the city and the city put out you know what I mean yeah park closes that dark means park closes at dark do you guys if it's dark out you don't go in there so you know stuff like that so I'm walking around my my neighborhood and you see the grass rustling and like a lot of it is in people's backyards and I'm thinking I'm not know part of me is going to go in somebody's backyard to catch a pokemon or capture a point or whatever but then I'm like this is this is what happened with ingress like people did this and and that trespassing no absolutely I actually found that I don't have to be that close to a Pokemon for it to appear on my screen that you know you can be pretty far from it and as long as you can see the actual pokemon then just touch it and then it's like becomes captura below have to get that up close yeah arsenal for like 40 pokies or polka Jim you have to be close enough for it in it the the animation of that icon on the map will change when you're close enough and for a Pokemon when it pops up as long as you see it on the map you tap it and you go into the catch mode janna kats your screen at that point if you're in catch mode you could go like a mile down the road and you're still in that capture mode where a pokey gym or pokey stop you have to be there for it to register and authenticate to give you your rewards or to do the battle I was a bit surprised on how close you had to be because there's a there's a bar down the street from me literally across the street so like three houses down and then you cross the street and it's right there and that's the nearest pokey stop i have and i couldn't check in on my couch and I was like really how close do you have to be so I walked I walked down the street and I was like okay I'm across the street from it oh I guess I'm not close enough and as soon as I like took like three or four steps into the road obviously one when the walk sign was on when when it was my turn to walk I was I was then close enough but I was I was a little like surprised like okay it this is the closest one to me but it kind of it it's not like I could just check in at my house every five minutes because the pokey stop refreshes in five to ten minutes yeah they turned like purple purple lady yeah they're blue when they're good and then they turned purple when they are inactive and then if somebody puts one of those lures on it it will start like making glitter come out of it like this pink glitter wait so I have a question for you because I missed this one of your mini episodes if the Pokemon doesn't have a green ring on it but it has a different color ring on it how do you make it green because i had a pidgeot like while i was walking iris and i couldn't catch it because i couldn't get thing to change the color uh you cuz i haven't seen any red so it's green yellow red for do this one had a yellow I had a yellow pit pidgeotto I think and it took just three or four balls do capture it pokeballs you just gonna have to wait till the circle gets like the smallest point what you can't change the color to green I think there's a way but I haven't gotten to that point i right I believe there are like berries you can throw or like feed them to calm them for that but I was able to capture a couple yellows yesterday I used my pokemon trainer club account to set up Pokemon go because what I was thinking is well my play pokemon stuff is tied to this and pay for everything else Pokemon related is tied to this this would be this would make the most sense and I played pokemon go for about 10-15 minutes on my couch and then the servers went down for me this was when it launched on Thursday night and first it went out on my iPad then it went out on my iPhone and I thought maybe it was an iPad issue or the servers went down they came back up for me around one a.m. friday morning so about six hours after the game came out i played for a little bit went to bed they were out ever since finally the pokemon trainer club servers came back up last night around 11pm if i'm not mistaken because i saw a bunch of tweets about it so that was the first time in almost two days i was able to log in my pokemon trainer club account in the meantime i made a google account to just capture data and get some stuff but i already put right when i got the game i put ten dollars into it because I wanted to I wanted to buy stuff so I could properly report on it as of this recording I think I think everything is down the servers have gotten better but did you use your trainer club or did you use just a gmail yeah no I use my trainer club okay and it's sort of the same reason as you right I want it to be tied my whole Pokemon experience like even my TCG play points and everything that's part of my trainer club account my VGC competent competitive stuff is in there so I want everything in my Pokemon life to be around my trainer club account not my google stuff which i barely use right yeah so it seemed between the time that pokemon trainer club trainer club accounts were down gmail the google accounts were working on and off more reliable while the ten times more reliable than the trainer club because it was down for almost 48 hours but it's interesting that there are dedicated servers to that and then there's dedicated servers to the google stuff well now it's it's the authentication methodology right because the pokemon trainer club accounts have to be authenticated by TPC I servers and and those are distinctly separate from Google authentication there a Google authentication is going to work ninety-nine percent of the time because they're authenticating email and everything all the time but it's it's really it's it's two separate sets of servers it's not going to the same place to authenticate so I mean if it was going to the same place to authenticate there be you wouldn't have to select from two different buttons when you were selecting to set up your account and everything like that um but yeah it's just I think that I think that they made two mistakes and this is completely assumption on my part there's no no fact in this or you know a no sign research in this but I think number one they were surprised at how many people wanted to play when the game was released in the first case but the real thing that they did not think through would be was the number of people who do not want to use a google account for anything at all and especially for Pokemon go so right the one of the main problems they've had is people haven't even been able to sign up for new player commodity outs because that whole system is so overloaded and the reason for that people don't want to set up google accounts people don't trust Google they think it's stealing their data and its sky any tickets stealing the antics taking your data from Pokemon go and sending it to Google well I know I mean but this is something I actually had to deal with at my job because we use Google services for a lot of stuff and there's really i would not i'm not gonna say unfounded but over sensitive / concern about what Google is doing with your data and I mean I could talk for an hour about the concept of privacy and what people actually believe is being done when they say that a company has access to your data versus what actually happens in reality but people just have this like unreal fear of Google so they're like well there's no way I'm going to use a Google account to sign up for this especially since it's about me walking around and it's got to know where I am on earth and then Skynet's going to send the Terminator after me so you know I'm only going to do this with a pokemon trainer Club a cow and then that's that's overwhelming Pokemon because they were like they were really thinking it's just going to be a very little overflow from the number of people who already have pokemon trainer Club accounts as opposed to a migration away from google into pokemon trainer club does that make any sense and I go yeah no I followed like words here okay yeah I followed you I when the trainer club account came back up last night at eleven I was I was finishing recording the third episode of The Journal report that I've been putting out for Pokemon go and going with my plan of resetting my sleep schedule for this trip I was taking I finally logged in probably 1 30am verified that it was working to cool my pokemon here that I caught on the first day my money is still here that I put into it so I was like okay well you know what I'll just walk to the pokey stop the bar down the street cuz it's 2am so it's still open not that I was going to go inside but you know I I guess I didn't want to be like the weird guy at like 3am walking looking like I'm walking to a closed bar I guess bars in Wisconsin by the way closed at two I too am so I walked over there checked in walked back caught a couple Pokemon and then at that point I hey what am I good at like how am I gonna stay awake and that and I decided I'm just gonna I'm just gonna drive to places where there will probably be pokey stops and pokey gyms and I will drive there i will park my car will get out i will do some stuff i'll get my car continued driving well that's how I ended up doing for two hours wait in Milwaukee yeah um well gee how dangerous that is I went to the more suburbs not downtown Milwaukee I was like more like Brookfield yeah yeah alright like watch oh send stuff so I love Wauwatosa so there there's a there's a target near me and it takes me exactly about 8 to 10 minutes to get to target from my house in a car I ended up taking an hour to get to that target because I pulled over so many times on the side of the road to as it I do not encourage or I do not want to hear about anyone playing pokemon go or driving I'm not I am I'm the friend in a car where if somebody is driving and they pull out their phone I'm like no you put that phone away hey the car is a no phone zone no phone zone because I'm a passenger in this car and I don't feel like dying today if you want to be on your phone the entire time I am more than happy to drive but no driving and texting when I'm in your car what you do on your own time is fine but I don't know yeah I'm just texting and driving not cool what I did last night is I looked at my phone I said this is the nearest pokey stop it was almost always like a church or a public building I'm going to drive directly to that pokey stop and as soon as I got there I would park I would keep my car running I would check in catch like two or three pokemon in the area I would then look for the next pokey stop in my in my map area I would drive to that I would park do the same thing and that's why I took me an hour to drive what was normally eight minutes down the road and it worked really well although like I guess I would rather like go to a busier place and just get out and walk around but I didn't really want to walk around like city blocks at three in the morning so that I just kind of stood in my car but I I ended up going out for two hours because I wanted to gather as much data and at that point I didn't sign up i joined the blue team battled at a gym a couple times i evolved the pokemon i did as much as I could in two hours and I actually started the night with 55 pokeballs I caught about 60 different pokemon in two hours and then I ended the night with 67 pokeballs just because of how many pokey stops I stopped at I wanted as much data as I could to report on it properly because it was I was running out of things to say because I couldn't log into my trainer club and that was the one I actually wanted to advance and you're actually a very creepy person who likes to hang out around funeral homes it was the first gym near me yeah you're a lost little guy it was a gym and a pokey step because I think they considered the statue outside of the funeral home the pokey stop and then the funeral home itself was the gym was there like a ghastly protecting it or a Grimer or what was over there ah again dar think that's where I found an execute yes I haven't found any like rare or unique Pokemon in my area like I have a pijat now that I caught like two or three pidgeotto zand I eventually evolved one of them because I had enough Pidgey candy I kept catching wheedles I evolved it enough to get a Beedrill a lot of paris's yeah there was a Paris right by my house I have found one magic carp so nothing 100 more to go ya know like guess I saw hunt a hunter silhouette on my map but I never found it there's jinx in my area I don't know if you have any chinks in your area I have not seen one mostly ratata mostly I didn't get an Eevee that executes was downtown and then like a piggies yeah nothing but but I'm very low level still I'm not even level five yet so yeah when you get higher up levels you start seeing more put more pokemon with higher combat points yeah yeah that's how I points so yeah um that was that was my night I ended it by going to mcdonalds getting breakfast and then going to bed the article I wanted to talk about here is titled Pokemon go isn't very good but it will be a huge but it will be huge anyways by Austin Walker who is formerly of giant bomb he now works for Vice gaming I'll read a little bit here from the article made by neon taking the pokemon company which is partially owned by nintendo pokemon go simplifies the complex rules of the traditional pokemon series and instead of emphasizing and instead emphasizes exploring your real-life surroundings as you wander around you'll find various pokemon in the world tap on them then you use a simple touch interface will throw a Pokeball at them if you toss it right you manage to any manages to stay connected the server it will add to your collection unfortunately my entire first day with pokemon go was dominated by technical issues the game locks up struggles to connect or stay connected to the servers the GPS fails to automatically update items will vanish or fail as they work it will crash again it's a mess wheres pokemon go might not even be that good of a game without the technical problems as in ingress neon takes previous GPS driven game pokemon go uses local landmarks like murals churches monuments and ingame destination as in game destinations some of these destinations give you items more pokeballs healing items for your Pokemon etc and other gyms where you can battle with rival players every player aligns themselves to one of three teams each trying to take over Jim's while building up their own defenses the early game is more about walking around stumbling into new Pokemon building your collection and it seems be a long term focus and it seems the long-term focus of Pokemon go will be gym battles the battles the bad news is the battles are pretty disappointing imagine a really impress I hunch out or infinity blade you swipe left or right to dodge incoming attacks tap to fire your own or hold down on the screen to launch a special attack I actually didn't know that until I read this article Pokemon does eight does include a familiar elemental resistance system but all the fights I have been in haven't benefited from it it never feels like more than wild get gesturing and hoping that the commands I actually enter sent through to the server all of this leads to a stuttering rhythm of play that goes against everything that made Pokemon so great over the year a good pokemon game entices you to stay awake in bed just so you can get a taste of what the next area holds you slide efforts effortlessly from one battle to another trying out new Pokemon and formulating strategic plans tension peaks at key battles and then smooth out once you're through it Pokemon go doesn't have any flow instead it moves fits in and starts that match it's choppy instead it moves in fits and starts that match it's choppy interface and then it kind of goes on saying how he met up with some people playing pokemon go they were really excited they said they never played a game like this they liked that they got to hang out together and go to weird places they liked that it was Pokemon and they didn't mind the crashing or the poor mechanics or the lackluster battles so I guess his argument would be that Pokemon go has a shelf life of about 1 me tomo ah i mean i agree with them in in a lot of aspects if you take away pokemon from pokemon go i don't think anyone would be playing it go you got that right and I and I think just that statement alone shows that the skeleton is just not very good for this game like Pokemon shuffle is still a good game even if it was not pokemon themed oh definitely true and a picnic Pokemon picross the same thing not Pokemon themed it's still a good game now I've enjoyed my time with Pokemon go and I'm very excited to play more of Pokemon go but I'm pretty excited to get the pokemon gold plus because I've caught probably 20 to 30 wheedles and it's not that exciting to catch wheedles like I definitely got excited when I saw a magic card because it was my first magic harp the other thing I I strongly agree with is is the battling at a gym I you're supposed to swipe left or right to dodge and I probably encountered four or five gym battles last night even I went into them even knowing I would lose cuz I just wanted to make sure I was understanding the mechanics and so I could report on that and I felt like I couldn't ever not get away from their attacks like I stopped attacking and tried just to dodge and I felt like I was still getting hit by everything and then I was like well I'm just gonna just keep attacking because it looks like they just keep attacking and that also didn't work either it just feel it just feels like a hot mess and maybe I'm playing it wrong but I feel like I'm alright at video games I feel like I understand the swipe left to dodge swipe right to dodge tap to attack like those seem like very basic mechanics um and for me it just it just I could no battle I was in it ever felt good or fun it just felt frustrating and now yeah at least the one thing that we should always be sure to say is they that this isn't um it's not set in stone right they can make improvements over time right and actually one thing I was having an argument with somebody online about which turned out I was wrong the release version of pokemon go right now is not a one point 0 version it's a 0.29 version yeah yeah technically it's not even like you know if you're looking at versioning numbers it's not at a a final version state in terms which surprises me cuz I thought apple was pretty strict about not allowing betas in the app store yeah I'm not sure I'm also not sure about the longevity of the game and I guess I would have to look more closely at ingress but I think one of the the pictures going around was there is a pit jot at the White House because the White House is a pokey gym and the pit jots name I think is America yo which is really funny right super funny that pit job from the picture and I could be wrong so this is just a general let's just say it has 500 combat point I've seen pokemon with more than 500 combat points so they go there they beat it let's say that Pokemon that beats it has 600 combat points and then somebody beats it with 700 combat points and then ate like at what point does it does it just come down to people trading like is there a combat point cap ah yeah and then when does it become to your to come down to your skill at battling right and if there is a cap at how does that apply to new players if every pokey gym is capped at a thousand championship points and every gym has three pokemon out a thousand champion or combat points sorry and you have six pokemon with a thousand combat points like how does that all play out or is it never ending is that value getting higher and higher like I'm assuming there's a cap at some point and where I don't know I don't know I am I had to do with teams it might the team building stuff might come in on that so like if you're a lower level player you can contribute your pokemon to would like be stay at the gym as part of your team without having to be a high level pokemon and maybe it levels up or something I do I really don't know the mechanics at all cuz I haven't been able to join a team yeah so I will be very curious of the longevity of the game while I do agree with a lot of Austin Walker's article about how the battling is disappointing the caching is a lackluster and if you take away the Pokemon skin this is probably not a game that people would be download it would probably not be a number one game in the itunes store with all those complaints i am still having a fantastic time with pokemon go when it's working yeah and I'm so really excited to play it so don't don't make that seem like we're really negative we're just being critical and we're just pointing out stuff because we want to see Pokemon go get better that's all those complaints are coming from they're coming from the the reasoning and the the motive of wanting this game to get better because we like it so far we can just see improvements in the future making it more enjoyable yeah can I can i submit my request for improvement to the Niantic company right now the one thing that I would like to see improved I let's hear it so when you're on the walking around map screen and if you set the map to like where the map moves around versus the York character moving around you know what I'm saying like the orientation and stuff so like it it auto Orient's where its showing mostly what's behind you when you're walking versus where what you're heading towards oh and I just want them to flip that I know you can manually like put your finger on it and rewrote it a map to to where you're walking but I kind of wanted to auto do that and be more focused on what I'm walking towards versus what I'm walking away from my one request I think besides them prioritizing fixing servers which is the most important thing to do don't get me wrong i think they said that trading was like the thing coming next to the game and then map fixing I don't know so so yeah I think that that kind of wraps it up those are our thoughts on Pokemon go no Travis they are still either out of country or no I think they said they are at their parents yes and also Travis does not use smart mobile devices so Travis will never have an opinion about Pokemon all right yeah they won't have an opinion on Pokemon go because they have a phone from 2006 it's a feature phone that's all you have to say with that being said we're gonna not do pokemon of the week just because we don't have a move set and I have way too much stuff to do before I get on a flight in less than 13 hours here so I want to get this cut and edit it and get it out for you guys I'm very excited for the next episode if everything goes smoothly from where my flights taking me we'll have a really cool guest on I don't want to say who that is or get anyone hype because if something falls through I don't want to be held to like well you said hopefully everything works out hopefully Pokemon go continues working throughout the weekend especially this upcoming week when I need it the most I don't know if I have anything else do you have anything well I do not have anything to add all right all right if you haven't done so already please take a couple seconds out of your day and review us in itunes we are really really close to 600 reviews and it would be the most amazing thing in the world if you could
