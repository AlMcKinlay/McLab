[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 445th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is greg hello as previously stated i have completed both hoenn challenges oh you got your bag on i got my bag on i did the incense hour thing just now before we started yeah cause i was out yesterday i was getting really crabby yesterday that there wasn't like i drove i specific went up for an hour and a half yesterday driving around no bag on raids no puzzles no mynums which i see a million of none i think the possible minins were discussed on the blog they didn't wanna because people don't want plus on mind and so they just saved it for the sentence day yeah which is probably a better way of doing it yeah well well i mean today is only one coin so you get it was one coin for three incense so i think it was fine yes uh yeah well hold on before we talk about incense day uh will is also here uh i did not get my bag on unless you mean at the supermarket and then i got a paper bag we're all here we don't have uh we covered a lot of news last week uh we saved the united some stuff to talk st of course look 25th anniversary there could be there could be nothing to talk about and we would still feel two hours ago we'd still show up i mean greg and i both bought pokemon themed workout gear that's an hour's worth of conversation right there that shirt is so good should i buy it how do you define good how do you fight no you won't like it how do you define good greg it's so when it's super comfortable it's soft it's lightweight it's very good for working out it fits really well i agree with all of these points it's cute now if i could only have a gym to go to that i wasn't afraid to go to ringfield i bought two i have ring fit adventure i'm level 85 or 87. you there's no point in looking cute for ring fit adventure because nobody's going to see you except your husband then people work out with you nobody's going to watch me stream ring fit adventure with my dogs down in my living room i purchased two workout tank tops from pokemoncenter.com when you know it wasn't down right and yes i can agree material super soft very nice for for working out in the graphic on the pikachu that's more of a cotton tank top which is like yeah it's in between you know it's what do they call it athleisure yeah yeah you can wear it to work out but also you know you could just wear it to hang out if you'd like hanging out in tank tops and showing off your shoulders which is pretty much my only good muscle but not a single handsome gentleman has come up to me in the gym to compliment my pokemon wear so we are calling this a pokey fail 100 i am the only person at the gym wearing pokemon gear so that was their opportunity that they've missed out on i mean i'm tempted to actually buy the tank top now i definitely don't wear tank tops but i am tempted to buy it because i like that shirt so much it is so that i mean the one we're talking about is the one where actually points off because the uh logo is is tiny it's a small tiny like pikachu circle in the upper uh left breast portion of the shirt but the material is just amazingly soft and moisture wicking and it just feels so nice on your skin 100 there speaking of pokemon center being down i guess that will be our first bit of news is what a disaster that skateboard was [Music] [Laughter] because our new uh thing on the show is to look up ebay prices or to search for japanese ice cream to find japanese zeroed cards pokemon skateboard i think is going for 400 to 700 on ebay the pikachu skateboard specifically the 25th anniversary one we should say yes which was uh if you could buy it 250 dollars right i know last week when i was checking it was it was it was close to the high 700s i'm checking right now it looks like there's a lot of buy nows for about 500 um and there's one that's 420 with 14 bids on it another one at 405 with two bids yeah it looks like it looks like it came down a little bit in price the question that i have that it's kind of the moral quandary that i see whenever confronted with these things because my first knee-jerk reaction is anybody who bought the skateboard just because they wanted to resell it for a higher price is evil and they're keeping people who actually want the skateboard to have the skateboard from having the skateboard because they bring down the pokemon center site completely but is this an indication that they're just not charging enough they're not charging the right price for these handcrafted pokemon skateboards and okay that they should actually price them at five to seven hundred dollars and then because that's what people are going to have to end up paying anyways and kind of destroy that secondary market maybe i mean would that destroy the secondary market it would make that secondary market more expensive well i mean there's got to be a limit like nobody's going to spend two thousand dollars for a handcrafted pokemon pikachu skateboard now are they well okay i don't know so what happened was on tuesday they were supposed to go live at i think 11 pacific time to easter the store was down and i got to a point where i could i could hit the add to cart button and then it would it would say like internal server error yeah that's where i got none of this is new this has happened multiple times we probably have covered it for like pokemon go fest early on and every concert that has existed playstation 5s and playstation 4s and wiis and well not wiius no one cared about that one but the other consoles that existed so it's not an issue with pokemon center specifically but if you s if you were able to get it into your cart on tuesday but not check out they sent an email tuesday evening saying like don't worry we didn't sell out of skateboards we'll have more on thursday so i don't know if they i don't know if they saw that the same people were getting through and buying the skateboards and they decided to like shut it down because on tuesday they had it set up where you before you even got or sorry on thursday before you even got to pokemon center you had to go through a capsica and you have to be you had to be like these six blocks or sidewalk and these two blocks or fire hydrant before you got there which i don't know if that completely stops bots like i'm not sure how the buying bots work to resell on ebay but at that point i'd even bother i don't know 250 was already at the high end and i feel for me it's like 250 plus two hours of your time on a website refreshing hoping something goes through is like a lot of dedication to something that you're gonna hang on your wall and be like yeah that's cool like i guess for me it would be that's correct a skateboard that you can't even ride i guess for me if if i could just spend the money get the instant gratification and not worry about refreshing a web page for two hours i'd be more inclined but even on thursday when i was like ah do i want this i was like ah the site is still loading slow and i'm still getting like temporary issues pikachu showing up there's a certain point where it's just not worth it i got the email saying i would that they were opening up on thursday but did i get as rude email no oh i still don't have that one yeah i get all your garbage come by stuff but the one time you're giving me the one thing i want i don't get the email well i especially appreciated also that i got an email saying hey this bear walker pikachu skateboard is now available on the pokemon center at 11 10 a.m that's right 10 minutes after it became available aka it's not available anymore they need to hire me as their official communications guru speaking of stuff not available anymore there was a tauros miltank in bufalant buffalotte boovalant max raid battle promoted event over the weekend which is actually the second one they did for the month this is the first time they did two they did their first ever a lot of first evers here first ever two events in one month and first ever repeat of an event so earlier this month they did the squivet repeat event um shortly after new year's they didn't really say why my suspicion would be well a bunch of people just got the game for christmas so why don't we re-run an event it was slightly different the first time they ran the school of an event you could only get shiny squavit the second time they ran it earlier this month was squivet and greed it could both be shiny i guess it doesn't really matter because you could just catch two squelve it and evolve one but they slightly changed it uh but is it chinese new year is that what it is year of the ox yeah this is about around the time of the year when chinese new year happens yeah to celebrate the year of the ox that's yeah i think that's chinese um yeah oh yeah well yes yes yes that was a chinese zodiac yeah yeah okay zodiac that's what it was i wasn't sure if it was like a constellation or something so it's the year of the ox it's technically february 12th there you go tauros military it's the year of the ox appearing in max raid battles lucky trainers can come across shiny tauros make sure you connect through mystery gift get wild area news you should see pillar of lights you can walk up to the event ends this event does not affect pokemon encounter with it within dynamics adventure anyways it was an okay event uh i found a shiny tauros i only maybe did it for like four hours i burned 250 wishing pieces a lot it is a lot i gotta stock back up now for the next event how many shinies did you get just one nothing too fancy my problem with this is still as always feel like lack of communication it's like the one thing niantic does kind of okay well so niantic can push push and update in the game which is very useful because that's probably where most people would see the news in the game they're playing niantic gives you like a two week heads up at least which is also very nice to know like i mean sometimes sometimes it comes for at least community days they do like we've never had a community day that's where like oh i didn't know comedian day was now tomorrow like their community days are are pretty well established two to three weeks ahead of time we usually know when it's going to be we know the pokemon it's going to be so like at least in the sense of pokemon stuff in sorted shield if they were like hey in two weeks we're celebrating year of the ox for sword and shield it's gonna be shiny tauros you could at least be like okay i'm gonna plan this weekend off because i really like tauros or you could be like okay well i already had plans i'm not going to move them around because i don't care about toros but instead you have this like last minute thing of like oh i didn't know there was a write event this weekend oh okay well i guess it's tauros do i do it do i not do it how am i gonna make time it's it's just i don't like i like surprises in video games i i do but this is not something that should be like a last minute surprise once a month it was nice the first couple times you did it now at this point you've been doing it every month just give us like a week heads up let us know and that way you can tweet it throughout the week because what happens is they put it on a blog post no one checks pokemon.com except this podcast and then they tweet it one time on like their play pokemon twitter account and then time and time again there's just people that are like oh i didn't know there was an event oh like what like people still don't even know this is a thing like i had tons of people come through my twitch stream being like is this new when did they start doing this like how do we know which like they just don't know that much about and i get some people just got the game recently for christmas but there's not even a name for it at least with community you go like oh community day that's the thing niantic does once a month for the like there's no this just encounter tauros miltank buff land but like they don't even have a clever name it's not promoted raids well that's confusing because there's promoted raids every month oh true i wonder if this year they're going to do two uh two a month i wonder if they're going to keep repeating like do one repeat do one new one which would be kind of cool because people missed earlier ones this is true i think that makes good sense to do it that way i mean they're obviously just trying to copy pokemon go and this is their version of a community day badly communicated and just read your news when you turn on your switch i saw it there this morning yeah oh yeah they do post it in the switch news area that is true i'm not sure how many people are reading that i don't get me either sometimes i vaguely acknowledge that there's something there before i just go straight into the game that i want to play like oh no there's a dot now it does have a dot normally okay this is some other uh news that probably no one knew but hey if you are looking for something to do pokemon geratina and the sky warrior is available free to watch on pokemon tv until february 5th i actually have not seen this movie in its entirety i've only seen like the first like 30 minutes well guess what shaman's character doesn't improve throughout the entire film so prepared to be annoyed for the entire thing that's what i kind of liked the first 30 minutes though shaymin was real sassy i do kind of like when giratina splashes down in like the fjord or whatever it was there's an interesting kind of like visual there where would you rank this movie will in the whole pantheon of human cinema or just just in pokemon films i'm trying to remember anything about this movie i have not seen every pokemon film so that's a tough call would it be uh top half of pokemon movies or bottom half so i okay i this is the way i think i would put it it's gonna be at the at the bottom half because it is like do you know did you ever see godfather 3 no all right well godfather 3 shouldn't have been made it's like it's it's a sequel out there and it was like they they wanted to make a sequel but nobody wanted that sequel that's what this movie is it's a sequel that nobody really wanted you know er but what if you like shaman then you should see a professional because shaman is like really bottom tier pokemon out there yeah it's cute and it does some weird transformation from a hedgehog to a deer excuse and the sky forms a deer what with no wings what it's got its ears or wings or whatever oh my ears are wings whatever yeah we'll learn how to fly with them dumbo but it's not even like in the celebi movie the celebi is like oh celebi's so nice i like shaymin is not nice it it wins no points in any area i have to agree that it's in the bottom tier because i know i've seen this film and i remember nothing about it it's pollution and cleaning the pollution and happy environment land it's fern gully pokemon style does ash die uh i don't think ash dies but i i literally think it's the third in the arciest movies and it's like yeah it is serious can we can we be done now let's get through our pokemon go news real quick here can we be done now uh nope uh the pokemon go tour canto celebration is still going uh we have johto come in on tuesday january 26th chicorita cyndaquil totodile murray poppip apam sunkern yanma murkrow glygar stubble slugma miltank and more will be featuring through around somewhere in the wild and if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny mill tank very fitting because we just talked about year of the ox the following i think niantic just got lucky with that one honestly the pokemon yes there's absolutely no planning involved they just threw the dice no i mean i don't think they've like they could have done shiny miltank anytime in the last like three years i don't think they were saving shiny miltank for the year of the x you don't know that maybe like the year of the actual big hidden event it's not a calendar cows are not oxygen well you were talking about a game where a fish evolves into an octopus we you get a little leeway here [Applause] we got a lot of issues following pokemon from 5k eggs pichu klepha iggly buff whooper ty rogue smoochum and larvaetar the following pokemon will appear in raids chikorita syndrome called murip merrell and larvaetar in one star toga tick espeon umbreon skarmory and miltank in three star raids get a little bit better with those three stars put that mill tank in there complete the johto challenge by collecting chikorita cinequilt totodile pseudo wudo sun kern murkrow smeargle miltank and larvatar to get 15 pokeballs 10 ultra balls and an incense get pokemon that no 2018 community event moves the following pokemon will know frenzy plant blast burn dragon paul smackdown which is secretary of cynical marip and larvitar wait what a total dial gets nothing excuse me that's exactly i'm okay with that total delegates nothing entei will appear in raids from tuesday january 26 to the 31st ryko from what this is a real long johto event ryko from sunday january 31st to the 5th to thursday february 4th and sweet from thursday february 4th to tuesday february 9th and that is that is the blog post let me tell you the last couple weeks slash months of pokemon go and me having these shiny legendaries and me not needing to do raids has been very good on my wallet wait what what's your current level in pokemon go 43. so you already did the 30 raids thing yeah because i got to do that and that's that um that's going to be a couple years i'm trying to think of like what like if i have a free raid pass yeah sure i'll do a sweet or i'll do a ryko or whatever i'm i'm curious how other people feel about this because i am not that collector that needs a hundred percent or a really good iv or i don't need like i'm good with a shiny and i'm just good with you know extra sweet coons like okay casual yeah i see where you're at but now that i have now that i have like a shiny reggie steel shiny red shiny reggie rock shiny entei suicune like i have them all so i have real no desire to do them like what am i gonna do with like i mean i have four shiny sweet coons because i got really lucky when we did that in dc well but i what am i well it doesn't matter why would i spend a dollar on something i don't need to do anything with see i mean i guess you need to get to the game you need to get to my level where you think why would i spend a dollar on indian list okay hold on i take it back there's there's two situations i would do it one is if i didn't have it and two if greg was like hey we're trying to do a suicune we only have three people we would really need your help i would spend the dollar to help out greg oh i see how it is [Laughter] but other than that i'm just i'm just curious of the the there are other people like me or similar to me where once they get a shiny of a pokemon in go specifically through raids they probably just don't have the desire to do the raids again but i suppose the whales probably cancel that out i suppose the whales will always cancel everything out yeah very true speaking of the these events did you guys complete your neither of you did the new unova one you didn't do the cinna one did you guys finish the hoenn one i just started the show saying i finished the hoe and one well look that wasn't look right now because there's a possibility i may have oops i have sound on for my go i know this particular program uh owen collection challenge i have zero check marks oh my god zero check marks wait greg why did you complete the hoenn challenge but you didn't complete the sinnoh or the unova because actually likes owen's the best region of course i'm gonna complete the hoenn challenge i will do none of the jodo challenge the worst region out there zero if i ha if the option presents itself to catch one of them i'll be torn on throwing that actual pokeball why is maureep featured in the incense day it's not even a hoe in pokemon oh right now because it can turn into a dragon oh yeah yeah yeah they released the the ampharos yeah mega and ferocious mega ampharos see my problem is at this point in the year let's blame it on the weather and temperatures and etc i'm only catching pokemon that throw themselves at me i'm not going out and looking for them and you know what this morning when i opened up pokemon go it was a drill bird jober is not on that list of hoe and pokemon i caught me a gilbert but that's as far as it went i mean i did go out yesterday for the sole purpose of completing the challenge also because i could not sit but not snow well it was before it started snowing because i knew the snow was coming and we had to go to costco so i went out ahead of time uh and did a bunch of hit all the weird spots that are in my neighborhood because there's a lot of them and it's a really easy driving pattern and then the few flakes started so i went i didn't complete it i completed the rest of it today but then i went home and grabbed brent and then we went to costco because we had to get to costco because i needed my giant uh jug of soy sauce and you're 16 pounds of cream cheese no we didn't do we didn't buy cream cheese there not this time we did buy way why are you buying a jug of soy sauce are you trying to murder me yes no oh i i marinate my weekly lunch your chicken your poisons in the soy sauce i do soy sauce and lime juice to marinate my chicken before i cook it for my lunch for the week plus i love soy sauce like i know not to feed you soy sauce but i love soy sauce it is one of my all-time favorite things me too i love the collection challenges i think they are great i like them a whole lot yeah but that's like your thing catching pokemon like like you like collecting things i do yeah i do really like big collector my issue with it is i've already collected them once it should count yeah i don't need to do this again i've been playing your game since it released yeah this is i have caught these things a million times don't you like getting a new pokemon game like whenever gen 9 comes out and pikachu will be in the grass aren't you like i don't have a pikachu yet no because i have a pikachu but that's awesome but but also it's because that's a new game right pokemon go is not a new game this is a new event i mean some would argue with the uh pokemon go beyond update it is a new game it is not a new game it is the same game my only problem with the collection challenge i okay so i i did see a few people being like collection challenge is bad because i can't find the shadow pokemon but that's what i like they added like difficulty to it last week by you going out and exploring which is like the point of the game which is the point of the game i like and being like oh does this grunt have a cloister or do they have the snover like that is fun and exciting to me like i am the person in sword and shield that's like well there's a one percent drampa here i'm going to keep doing it until the drampa shows up and then when it should thrill of the hunt and then when it shows up i'm going to catch it where i do have like a million drama in my pc i could have just moved it over and then put it in the daycare or like i like rare stuff i like the thrill of the hunt my problem with the collection challenge is why is there only like eight or nine pokemon there are give why is what else isn't hoeing rosalia why was rosalia not on this list i got a lot of and rosetta community is coming up why is makitu not on this list why is carvana on this list i'm looking at them all right right now why are you not on this list like just giving them all no just give me more things to catch i'm seeing them anyways all the time you're giving us a whole week i had the thrill of catching it the first time and i still have that memory there's nothing it's not like ooh i caught this one outside my house unlike the 15 other times i caught it outside my house when i was in japan i was like oh japanese central i need this there's nothing different about it it says it was caught in japan yeah nobody cares no nobody cares exactly i don't care i have a japanese farfetch'd a taiwanese american farfetch i mean i like like if i'm playing the game the very first time like in shield i generally just caught things as i saw them on the route because eventually i'll need to complete that pokedex and they do the thing where they hold access to home or bank until two months after so you can't complete the pokedex anyways that's a very different experience than here's an event in the game where you can still see them in my box i can point to them i can highlight them 100 agree i caught this why do i have to catch this again isn't steve the guy who's always harping about uh like respect my time yes you get this you get rewards for right disrespect my time rewards for it what about the time in the past that i spent getting these dudes yeah that's that now that's disrespecting that past time so only current time deserves respect and all the time in the past i do have you seen my bag and pokemon go i am overflowing with candy there will never be a need for me to have xl candy for a ninketa [Laughter] uh you know i can't disagree with you there there will never ever ever ever ever ever ever be a reason to have any candy for a plusel or a miner never never are you ever gonna do anything but shove them in the box and say look you two cuties why don't you go play together away from me because basically you're useless i got shiny ones i don't have shiny ones all right well let's take a break uh when we come back we're gonna talk about some i don't well we talk about leaks every now and then uh pokemon unite has been in beta in china for quite a bit of time and there are there are some leaks i think it's interesting to talk about i guess if you don't want anything spoiled for this game you can skip that segment but when we come back we're going to be talking about some uh screenshots and some stuff from pokemon unite so we will be right back leg tubes leg tube leg tubes tube leg tubes leg tube leg tubes two warmers socks the phrase like tube might be good right the phrase like a tube might be electric leg tube leg tubes tube leg two leg two with leg tubes two warmers well then they're just like i guess yeah hey short and sweet this week if you are enjoying it's super effective and you want to go an extra level to support you can head over to patreon.com p-k-m-n-c-a-s-t or you can just head over to isc.cash and for two dollars a month you can support our podcast that we do every single week and you can now because patreon lets you sign up for an entire year and that only comes to like 20 dollars and that puts money in our pocket and puts pokemon on the table for us to eat that doesn't that that doesn't work anyways uh you can head over to patreon.com pkmcast if you would like to support the show and that's it i hope you enjoy the rest of this podcast thank you for listening [Music] and we are back uh before we get to the pokemon you night stuff vgc competitive stuff is changing again uh we were on series seven rules ever since november first i think cause crown tundra came out yeah the end of october so yeah series 7 was november 1st through the end of this month so three whole months of series seven which was the main change was they added you could already use legendary pokemon like kobelian and tarakian for example but because the crown tundra added the rest of the legendary pokemon uh you were allowed to use like landorus or thunderous or tornados or cresselia for example so that obviously switched up a lot as well as the introduction of glastrier and spectrier which were two very popular pokemon being used competitively as well but now series 8 rules were announced this is off daily daily esports.gg uh you are allowed to use one restricted legendary pokemon which in the sun and moon series you are allowed to use two but they're saying you're allowed to use one here there's also no blue orb or red orb so you can't get primals which is probably a good thing but uh if you want to know the restrictive legendary pokemon most of these are box pokemon um there's some exceptions here like mewtwo but we have mewtwo lugia kyogre groudon rayquaza dialga palkia giratina reshram zekram kirim xerneas yivital or yveltal zygarde cosmog cosmoam so well no one's using cosmog or cosmo but they're technically restricted so galio lunala necrozma zashian zamazenta eternius eternitus and uh calorex fused with glastrier or spectrier only the fused one unconfused is fine you could use a fused one with an unfused one so you could use this i was going to say yeah they count as two separate pokemon when it's fused it counts as one restricted one it's so you like on my team right now my series seven i have both glass tree or and spectre are on my team i call it dose horses because doses too so i could do glass deer and spectre and calorics riding on one of the two because technically it's not glassy or spectra it's calorics which is weird to think about it's like when necrozma takes over solgaleo and it's dawn wings necrozma but it's not even though it looks like sogalia not don sorry duskman i don't know which legendary is going to be super good here i mean like no no mewtwo is going to be like besides cosmog because mom no one's using me too but okay so like the reason kyogre and groudon were so good is because then one of their abilities um like kyogre has drizzle groudon has the sun one drought so those those are good in itself because of weather but they were also good because of the blue orb and the red orb xerneas has always been good because of geomancy uh yveltal has always been good so gail and elena not so much but i think the necrozma that is lunala as well dawn wings i think is really good because of their ability uh zamasunte is a garbage pokemon as much as i love zamasunta zashina is the better of the two there kazashian has a crazy high attack stat plus it boosts its attack stat once it ends up in battle plus its typing is really good it's very steel or steel fairy so i'm not i'm not sure what happens in a meta game where you can have a calorics and you can have azashian and xerneas is back in form uh so it'll be interesting uh i guess we don't know how long it will last well we do know how long it will last it will go from february 1st to april 30th and then i i don't know may 1st do they allow two legends instead of one uh do they do a ban do they ban pokemon uh we don't know what happens at that point but i feel like they would ban at that point right like okay we played with it for right now let's see what happens when we take them away and then the one after it's like you can have all the legendaries just go crazy well yeah i was gonna say they'll do like the tier thing and they'll do like the top ten get knocked out again like they've done before yeah well top 10 yeah i guess we'll have to see what top 10 is but like top 10 right now is i know top three right now are urshifu tapu finney and incineroar i'm also curious how hershey foo fits in with all these like new pokemon it'll be interesting um but hey good for them for keeping the game fresh i guess speaking of freshness pokemon unite so this is uh this is january 15th off dota dot dot esports i don't know why i said dota dot esports new leaks reportedly show off skins and other details the leaks came from centro pokemon a website known for reliably spreading early information i don't agree with that sentence i would say a website known for spreading early information i would remove the word reliably well no just change what uh what reliably is you can rely on them to spread information whether that information is true or not well okay i agree with the sentence now okay so this is kind of hard because uh this is an audio podcast but they showed some skins that are available i'm going to try to describe them to you i believe this stuff should have been uh nda just like how pokemon go was available in australia like two months early and if you took a screenshot of something it had your trainer id on it so niantic could pinpoint who was the one sharing the information and stuff but we we know a couple things from what's going on here so in the screenshot we have we see a lucario uh score but um cinderace uh greninja mr mime a talonflame and a guard chomp so i'm pretty sure at least as up to what we know mr mime was not a confirmed playable character when they originally showed the trailer so now they are and i think cinderella's was also not shown early but now they are i thought i thought cinderace was oh okay maybe um i don't yeah i don't remember but i thought cinderace was the only one yeah mr mime is the one that i thought oh okay mr bob's in this game [Laughter] the lucario is dressed as zorro i guess is probably my best bet no he's dressed in the outfit that's in that one lucario movie oh zorro yes so zoro the moment they go back in time and he matches his trainer oh the one with uh the like three million year war and stuff yeah i think it's that outfit maybe i get yeah sure i mean it's more of a reference than zorro i mean it's very fitting to lucario i would say here it's not surprising then we have a score bunny in a pirate outfit i think that's probably the best way to describe it yes pirate king score button and then we have a greninja in what i believe to be like a power ranger outfit specifically the green ranger oh sure yeah except no helmet no helmet no helmet but he has like a little he has a kind of like though it was a greninja that's true he has like kind of like the morpher on his belt it looks like well they each have a pokeball featured somewhere as part of the item yeah yeah and then we have a mr mime in circus okay yeah he's a ring master yeah a yellow ring master outfit and then we have like a newspaper delivery talent flame it's newsies talonflame that is so weird he feels like that is not as weird as the next one he has like actually the newspaper cap and then he has like a gray scarf and then finally we have beach dad garchomp it's a garchomp with a hawaiian shirt on with a what are those called pool mask it's a scuba man don't wear that in the pool unless you want to look like a fool you wear goggles instead you're in a pool you don't need to wear anything on your face if there's too much chlorine yes okay the other thing in this screenshot is that i sent y'all pictures from that movie all right i'm looking at them yeah maybe it's the same cape and bag on the side and same hat shape okay yeah okay the bag the bag does line up maybe all right it's pretty it's pretty close okay the other thing to take away from the screenshot is there's some currency as associated with it and i'm not sure what to make of this currency so it's starbursts star pieces it's it's 3 100 star pieces for the lucario 3150 for the score bunny and i don't know maybe because greninja is discounted or it's a sale it's 1260. so i don't know if that's like i don't think it's 31.50 i know i doubt that but i'd be though look pokemon tax yeah i also don't think it's like three maybe it is like three dollars and 15 cents i don't know probably not three dollars how much is an outfit in league of legends or dota who who are you asking one of you neither of us plays league of legends or dota so how much are hats in dota the first thing that came up is dota worth playing yes dota is fun if you enjoy that kind of a game yeah i don't know how much a hat is in dota in this article it says somebody paid 15 for a fancy jacket in battlefield heroes you know i wouldn't actually now that i'm thinking about it how like a skin in apex legend is like 20 dollars what what do the skins have magical powers no it's actually unreal how expensive like if you want a skin for a gun or a skin for a character it's like between 15 to 20 dollars per skin oh heck no no way and it's been that way for almost two years because apex is going on two years and they haven't changed it so it's clearly working right like somebody is buying these i'm not i i think young people who have misguided priorities that's your market right there what if you really like a character then play that character in its regular clothes so the recently released collegiate attire in final fantasy 14 on the mog station is 18 yep that's wait can i get georgetown gear in final fantasy 14 uh maybe i don't know what the georgetown gear looks like well i mean it would be blue and gray well you could probably dye it blue and gray and it would say georgetown on it well what's collegiate about the collegiate gear i don't even know what that word means it means representing your college yeah oh this is bunk this is not even u.s collegiate this is like if you're a fancy british person no pass no dot esports is also reporting that it wasn't shown in this screenshot but there was a machamp wearing swimming trunks and a lay if you go to the tweet you can see it oh i see it i see it i see it uh we also have some new characters that were not shown before so i think we i think they showed snorlax originally yes and i think they showed gardevoir originally yes it looks like there's an absolute being added yeah and a cr crust [Laughter] crossover oh i i know who it is i'm just not sure who uh you know there's like i don't know like 800 some pokemon and somebody decided crustal was a option i guess maybe just to maintain balance man yeah very defensive pokemon i would assume you know we know about alolan nine tails no that one is also new then we have a venusaur charizard blastoise i don't think anyone's surprised about those three you gotta pander appropriately pikachu of course nine tails there's a pikachu in this game whoa whoa slow down a lot nighttime is a cool choice yeah oh so there was another tweet from pokes it looks like that tweet oh i found iphone i was like did it get deleted it shows what looks to be the probably like the switch icon which was like a score bunny and a greninja and then it said pokemon unite in the corner uh and then they also confirmed that kramer ant will be a playable character and they have it next to the crustal in another screenshot so that looks pretty pretty real i guess there was a couple not in this article but there was a couple of screenshots that showed different app icons for the nintendo switch like they were probably testing which i guess i guess you test for that you like put out yeah absolutely what is more when you're like scrolling through like the e-shop or the switch store like what icon grabs people's attention yeah very curious of how much these character skins are gonna actually cost i mean if it's free to play and that's how they're making their money yeah it's not gonna be cheap it's not gonna be cheap the real question is how cheap is the pokemon community that we actually pay for these things how cheap is the community did you not look at should not look at pokemon go sales true it was depends i mean the game had best be fun that people want to pay money so yeah i but also are pokemon go players going to be playing pokemon unite i don't know if there's an overlap with moba players um probably not but i mean if there are moba players that have already sunk in a lot of money and they like pokemon i don't see why they wouldn't sink in a lot of money here true i think pokemon go players are like the hardcore whales of pokemon go i don't think anything's going to pry them away from it no speaking of money this is our our last thing we're gonna cover for the episode uh is it was a tweet user eclipse underscore tt i'm not a hundred percent sure how accurate this is that's interesting though so take this with a grain of salt they're not a verified twitter they're from italy but they said pokemon earnings have leaked they have no source for this i'm not sure how trustworthy they are it seems it seems believable so and it's i don't think it's that harmful to cover here it just says uh the merchandise part of pokemon has made 67 billion dollars the video game part has made 19 billion dollars the card game tcg has made 12 billion dollars the box office movies make 1.7 billion magazines 1.4 the anime 863 million and the manga 72 million dollars how does the cartoon make money oh commercials commercials wait does that exist anymore uh i mean in canada it's on regular tv and i think on the uk it's on regular tv in the united states it's on netflix yeah i mean my world has become so distorted that literally i was i was talking about a very exciting product that i've been using recently that i'm super excited about and she's like oh i saw the tv commercial for that and did you see the tv commercial for that and i was like what's a tv commercial yeah i what i don't even get youtube commercials anymore i only i only occasionally see youtube commercials and the streaming service that we watch uh masterchef australia and other such foreign tv shows is has ads in it but that's the only time i ever see commercials anymore i don't even know when things are on anymore like i don't know when a new episode is supposed to drop i just wait for some to be uh like on twitter to be all excited about it i'm like oh i should go watch that i guess even if this uh tweet is not a hundred percent accurate it's what these numbers are very very close to what lines up on what was reported on wikipedia uh for their earnings which the wikipedia has like different sources of what report where where they're getting those reports from well and it all translates to the same thing no matter what the numbers are and it's that uh pokemon makes a heck ton of money oh yeah huge yeah specifically the merchandise like the amount of it's actually unreal how much of how how many new pokemon merchandise things come out like weekly in japan like stickers pens plushes purses underwear sure like they are just nc producing new things so awesome that is the problem right i i will not i i don't stuffed animals is a no i i don't want those in my house i'm not gonna have a couch full of stuffed animals like some people i know but dad if they had like pokemon themed quality office supplies that my that my office would be that absolutely i would have like little sticky notes with pokemon on them and you know a nice you know my pencils would all be pokemon pencils and but man you just can't get that easily here back to ebay yeah no you know where the kids hang out ebay all right greg question of the week all right let's hear it please ask me the question of the week there's a lot of good ones this week actually yeah it's a good it's a good match we just do a one pokemon answer for this what pokemon would have given up their new year's resolution by now um gulpin [Laughter] yeah trubish absolutely i mean slowpoke is still working on 2010. i feel like tokumar togo tomorrow would have given up tomorrow's resolution it depends what the resolution was hey i think snorlax resolution every year is to sleep more okay this question is from steven uh before you became financially independent were there any pokemon related merchandises you wish your parents relatives friends would have gotten you unfortunately they didn't oh see this is a good question because you guys were already adults when pokemon was already financially independent and i did make a ton of pokemon purchases including pokemon box all for myself is there any merch you regret missing out on greg there are a few uh gba's that were pokemon related that i didn't i've got the torchic one and i think there was a couple more and i really really like the torchic one i really wish i would have bought the other ones it's the only one i can think of that just the special editions of the consoles that i've come and gone that i didn't purchase some i couldn't like the was it the gold one that never came here the gold yes that would that's my answer right there that one yeah the gold 3ds the gold three it had like the beautiful evaltol art on it yeah i don't remember that one because it never came to the u.s it never came to the us we got the like the black 3ds and the blue 3ds there was a gold one that had a beautiful art on it that was beautiful and i wanted that one to come and it didn't come here i i wish that 230 on ebay right now yeah well that that game system has passed so into that i know i still play my 3ds every day no box though only console how about you steve i mean i will say i could go on about all the star wars stuff i wish my parents bought me when i was a kid that they never did uh i think consoles is a good one um i had a couple of the pokemon consoles that i no longer have because at one point i was very poor in my life and i needed to sell some stuff uh there are some cards i wish i never sold but i had like i had tropical beach which i think is a very expensive card now when i bought it it was a hundred and twenty dollars but i think uh i think it's like a four hundred dollar card now not that i would sell it just be cool to have in my collection again yeah i guess yeah there's there i mean there were lots of things my parents didn't buy me pokemon related that i would would have wanted but a lot of that stuff was probably just like cheap homey slash what other what other toy companies were there back in the day uh i can't remember who used to make toys before wicked cool toys took over but i wanted a lot of that stuff hasbro oh you mean pokemon stuff yeah oh yeah yeah i'm very very upset i never got pokemon box but also when pokemon box came out that was like the that was like the short period of time where pokemon was off my radar that would have been when i was middle school like late middle school yeah nothing super super stands out like if i if i was uh if i was swimming in like ninja or pokemane or shroud money you better believe i'd be going to ebay and i'd be buying all these pokemon consoles that i missed out on i will say the one thing that i wish existed and i think that some this is gonna sound so weird i don't know how to put it out the right way my mom has a hello kitty that is literally like all diamonds and precious gems it's like a little hello kitty pendant like if there was like really really nice not somewhat potentially offensive pokemon jewelry out there i'd probably go for that like a really high quality pokemon rolex that's that's what i'd be going for at this point in my life i mean it had the fossil 10th anniversary uh pikachu watch i did buy that and i wore that for a very very long time before it died high enough quality i've made a lot of poor pokemon choices in my life greg you put that pokemon box up on ebay it's going for 810.41 bids why would i get away give away my precious pokemon box i will sell it on my death bed when it's worth five thousand blocks that's true you gotta let it appreciate a little bit more and yes exactly it's so funny because the japanese version of pokemon box is like 50 bucks and i finally found it so you know i found my copy again well put it in your safe deposit box man don't don't let it get lost again yeah i know where it is now i i've i've put it in a safe spot you are like actually at this point better off buying a japanese gamecube buying a japanese copy pokemon box and then being done with it yeah i don't think there's like anything specific that i like super super regret not having because most of that stuff you can find it's just like more expensive or less less expensive i remember like as a kid the burger king gold coins cards like i wanted them so badly and the only reason i think my parents got them wasn't to satisfy me but because they they sincerely thought that they were going to be worth something in the future because that was around the time where everyone in the 90s thought everything was worth something like beanie babies and baseball cards and everything but now like if you were like man i really wish i had those burger king gold coins like they're they're like 50 bucks on ebay that's 50 bucks you don't have though it's true those those will be you know when the economy collapses and we are all trading in pokemon gold coins you'll wish that you had those like i did true very true you got to buy them now put them in your safe deposit box get your kids through college yep oh yeah that was back in the time where they really pushed poliwhirl real hard on things yeah they were really pushing by polly world they pushed pollyworld real hard for a long time yeah it didn't really work out for it yeah because then polly toad came along and there was like get out of here will pokemon of the week oh oh no you guys can't handle this all right last week's pokemon of the week supposed to be easy i think it was easy compared to pokemon evolution lines from kanto if you remember that place and uh one of the clues was that one of the evolution lines kind of does what happens in the real world one doesn't one changes its type combinations for its final evolution one doesn't one it gets a gigantomax one gets a mega evolution one's a version exclusive and that's the one that we were actually looking for and then i said which pokemon has 14 feet a party hat and a clown nose [Laughter] and shows up in pokemon go way too much it's gulpin gulpin doesn't show up in pokemon go at all okay you're good weedle weedle that's right women that's a super cute shuffle icon although i do feel that the shuffle icon skimped on the party hat too much hmm party hat oh you mean it's needle yeah are you telling me that bees don't come from poisonous bugs that go into a cocoon well wasps don't cocoon that's all i can say wasps do not cocoon ah is there any weedle trivia out there oh it's been around forever the original early drawing of weedle that's listed in bulbapedia is wild to me yeah it looks like from some child storybook it looks like a twinkie with a clown's head attached so pokemon platinum weedle was completely incapable of damaging steel-type pokemon outside struggle it could only learn poison sting which steel types were immune to from platinum onward weedle could learn bug bite what a useless piece of trivia and what explains the near extinction of weedle when steel types arrived uh then wheel evolved to finally be able to defend itself at what point in the game are you being like oh man i really my wheel hasn't evolved yet my starter's dead i'm facing a magnemite a lot of things would have to line up for this to happen i don't even know how early on you could even get wheedle and platinum i don't remember it being on one of the early routes because it was like remember yeah b doof and shanks are on early routes starly weedle is the only pokemon that cannot legitimately know any normal type moves that that's a good piece of trivia oh yeah no though i don't know what legitimate means can another can you not even breed it it's weird no tms no hms nothing like that no giovanni had a weedle in the manga it evolved into a bee drill well that's what they do that's the whole nature of the weed is that all you got that's all i got that's it okay not a lot i mean there is but it's all like in this section of the anime in episode 1042 all right here we go this is just a series of questions so be prepared to answer a bunch of questions did you know twitch plays pokemon is still a thing it still exists do you remember that certain people felt that omanite was an important pokemon because of the helix fossil fetishism do you think that they were wrong or right do you remember the other members of the twitch plays pokemon team do you think that there was an accident in the finalization of pokemon red and blue do you feel magikarp should evolve into dragonite and dragonair should evolve into gyarados have you seen similar patterns in other kanto pokemon have you looked into the eyes of one bug type pokemon and wondered why its eyes change when it evolves that its eyes change to look like a different pokemon do you remember the clues to last week's pokemon of the week if they referenced two different pokemon does this week's pokemon complete the triad there you go oh man i love this stuff i don't know if uh you did the twitch plays pokemon because it just celebrated like their anniversary excuse me we don't question the grand wizard of pokemon of the week sir oh my mistake what a time to be alive oh i i take it back from earlier to answer steven's question it's not specifically money things i miss i feel like i missed out on i miss i i regret missing out on just like event pokemon that all you had to do was like connect to the internet and get them i'm trying to remember if there were some because i went to almost all the mall events i'm trying to think if there's anything given out at those that i was able to get because i actually did the pokemon rocks america i took a train to chicago by myself and went to that event pokemon rocks america is the most 90s title of an event ever i mean you're not wrong all right well that's our episode for the week thank you all for listening we will be back next week we're
