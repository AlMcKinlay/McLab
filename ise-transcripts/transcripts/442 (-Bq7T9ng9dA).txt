something a little different (0:57 - 1:00)
look if we're going to do something (0:59 - 1:03)
different we have to plan that like (1:00 - 1:05)
something different on the fly never (1:03 - 1:06)
works (1:05 - 1:10)
but it is 20 21 welcome to 2021. (1:06 - 1:13)
well also here back from uh travis west (1:10 - 1:13)
virginia (1:13 - 1:17)
east virginia and (1:13 - 1:17)
thanks for uh doxing me there (1:17 - 1:24)
i don't know i i honestly feel (1:20 - 1:27)
that 2021 is the year of relicanth i'm (1:24 - 1:27)
not saying (1:27 - 1:31)
i'm not saying no i'm saying no (1:27 - 1:34)
look the main argument (1:31 - 1:37)
i have for why 2021 is the year of (1:34 - 1:38)
relicanth because (1:37 - 1:43)
numerous times doing dynamaxx adventures (1:38 - 1:45)
the new craze that all the kids are into (1:43 - 1:46)
this year (1:45 - 1:49)
from last year carryover carryover you (1:46 - 1:53)
constantly over and over don't sleep (1:49 - 1:56)
on relicanth that thing will carry you (1:53 - 1:57)
through (1:56 - 2:00)
to the end of any dynamax adventure it (1:57 - 2:01)
is strong (2:00 - 2:03)
it'll get you where you need to go i'm (2:01 - 2:04)
i'm (2:03 - 2:08)
for it the tertinator crew (2:04 - 2:12)
pointing out that it's grass (2:08 - 2:14)
water and then it should be a fire type (2:12 - 2:17)
this year has won me a little bit with (2:14 - 2:18)
that argument (2:17 - 2:20)
i still like gear of the sock though (2:18 - 2:21)
like socket to it (2:20 - 2:23)
but the problem is is that number one (2:21 - 2:24)
you're mispronouncing (2:23 - 2:28)
it where she washes out the window (2:24 - 2:28)
the problem is number one you're (2:28 - 2:31)
mispronouncing swalk (2:30 - 2:35)
number two when i say sock you get mad (2:31 - 2:38)
sock has a partner (2:35 - 2:42)
sock has throw right miractus didn't (2:38 - 2:43)
have a buddy (2:42 - 2:47)
quillfish didn't have a buddy (2:43 - 2:50)
uh-huh sock's got a buddy well i can't (2:47 - 2:53)
relicanth has no not only i mean (2:50 - 2:55)
tertinator doesn't have a buddy either (2:53 - 2:58)
the terenator is just i i why would you (2:55 - 2:59)
bring up tertinator when you can bring (2:58 - 3:01)
up torquel (2:59 - 3:05)
i mean i'm fine with torque now but also (3:01 - 3:07)
turtles are gross (3:05 - 3:11)
[Laughter] (3:07 - 3:14)
the thing about relicanth is it is so (3:11 - 3:17)
exclusive that they like banished it to (3:14 - 3:18)
new zealand (3:17 - 3:23)
that's like the rarest of the standalone (3:18 - 3:25)
dude what if it's the year of the soul (3:23 - 3:26)
rock (3:25 - 3:29)
and we are like martin where we just we (3:26 - 3:30)
pretend that we're doing something for (3:29 - 3:33)
2021 but we're really (3:30 - 3:36)
not like 201 is just a big build up for (3:33 - 3:37)
no payoff (3:36 - 3:39)
well that's soul rock in a nutshell (3:37 - 3:42)
isn't it (3:39 - 3:42)
all right we got a show not a lot of (3:45 - 3:50)
pokemon news as (3:48 - 3:54)

brand new games and to yeah that (6:27 - 6:32)
announcement was so great (6:30 - 6:35)
it was it was really fantastic i'm so (6:32 - 6:39)
excited that they're remaking galler (6:35 - 6:39)
to fix the trees this time it's the (6:40 - 6:44)
update (6:43 - 6:48)
and new that i've been waiting for 2020. (6:44 - 6:51)
did either of you watch the uh sunrise (6:48 - 6:55)
nope i woke up (6:51 - 7:00)
and then at 10 o'clock was like oh damn (6:55 - 7:02)
that was today i thought about it two (7:00 - 7:03)
hours late (7:02 - 7:05)
i mean it's on youtube it's like a two (7:03 - 7:06)
hour video you can go back and (7:05 - 7:09)
watch it i the pokemon section of it was (7:06 - 7:10)
about (7:09 - 7:13)
like two minutes it wasn't terribly long (7:10 - 7:15)
maybe it was like four minutes (7:13 - 7:18)
but it was the the astronaut they (7:15 - 7:19)
featured on the (7:18 - 7:22)
kibo.space website i can't remember his (7:19 - 7:23)
name i'm sorry (7:22 - 7:25)
um and then the it was like (7:23 - 7:26)
unfortunately (7:25 - 7:29)
it was not a pikachu plush which it (7:26 - 7:30)
would be really great to see (7:29 - 7:33)
a plush floating around in space it was (7:30 - 7:34)
just a (7:33 - 7:37)
like 3d ar rendered pikachu that said (7:34 - 7:38)
pika (7:37 - 7:42)
a couple times and then (7:38 - 7:46)
a rayquaza showed up because (7:42 - 7:49)
as greg and i discussed last week the (7:46 - 7:51)
alga and palkia do not make sense in (7:49 - 7:53)
space (7:51 - 7:53)
while palkia can control space it's not (7:54 - 8:01)
outer space it is the theory of space (7:57 - 8:04)
um well the dimensions yeah the (8:01 - 8:06)
dimensions that's right (8:04 - 8:08)
pretty much d uh sorry did i say diago (8:06 - 8:09)
palkia (8:08 - 8:11)
palkia is just a giant ruler is really (8:09 - 8:14)
like like a tape measure (8:11 - 8:18)
oh it's more like graph paper (8:14 - 8:20)
yeah yeah that's really good because it (8:18 - 8:21)
does you know (8:20 - 8:24)
well but it also has the the y-axis as (8:21 - 8:25)
well (8:24 - 8:27)
you know it's like a graphing calculator (8:25 - 8:30)
wait which one is ty dial goes time (8:27 - 8:31)
diagonal this time because there's dial (8:30 - 8:33)
in its name so dialga (8:31 - 8:36)
got ripped off because palikia has got (8:33 - 8:37)
the (8:36 - 8:40)
x y and z dimensions yeah pokemon z (8:37 - 8:41)
confirmed (8:40 - 8:44)
and dialga just has the fourth dimension (8:41 - 8:46)
of time (8:44 - 8:49)
so a 3d animated rayquaza showed up for (8:46 - 8:50)
a hot second (8:49 - 8:53)
and when i say hot second i mean like 20 (8:50 - 8:55)
seconds of like screen time (8:53 - 8:57)
they went to the panel of like (8:55 - 8:58)
celebrities or (8:57 - 9:02)
um judges i don't know they think of (8:58 - 9:02)
like (9:02 - 9:05)
i'm so it's so hard to explain this just (9:02 - 9:07)
for the silly thing that they did (9:05 - 9:09)
but imagine like eight people sitting on (9:07 - 9:11)
very high stools (9:09 - 9:13)
like talking in between the space stuff (9:11 - 9:16)
at one point after the pikachu floats by (9:13 - 9:18)
and the rayquaza shows up (9:16 - 9:19)
there's like a guy sitting on one of his (9:18 - 9:22)
high stools and he holds up a nintendo (9:19 - 9:22)
switch (9:22 - 9:24)
with pokemon sword and shield and then (9:22 - 9:27)
he looks down at a piece of paper (9:24 - 9:32)
and then reads like the bullet points (9:27 - 9:34)
of sword and shield and then says (9:32 - 9:36)
there's a pikachu available (9:34 - 9:40)
and that's it like it was exactly what (9:36 - 9:42)
we said it was going to be which is an (9:40 - 9:44)
ad it was an (9:42 - 9:47)
ad for pokemon sorted shield that was in (9:44 - 9:49)
collaboration with the space event (9:47 - 9:52)
and they gave a free pikachu (9:49 - 9:55)
out and to be fair i wasn't expecting (9:52 - 9:57)
anything i was expecting to see a (9:55 - 9:58)
pikachu floating in space (9:57 - 10:01)
i got that i was not expecting a (9:58 - 10:03)
download for a pikachu (10:01 - 10:05)
but of course the internet's not never (10:03 - 10:06)
happy and they were upset that it's not (10:05 - 10:08)
a shiny pikachu i don't know (10:06 - 10:10)
but this is oh you can't use that audio (10:08 - 10:11)
podcast (10:10 - 10:15)
i'm moving my hands i would argue that (10:11 - 10:16)
a special ribbon pikachu is more rare (10:15 - 10:18)
than a shiny because how many special (10:16 - 10:19)
ribbon pikachus do you have (10:18 - 10:21)
i know the answer is zero now you have (10:19 - 10:23)
one speaking of getting ripped off (10:21 - 10:25)
uh this was sent in by kevin from our (10:23 - 10:26)
slack community (10:25 - 10:28)
uh we forgot to cover this last couple (10:26 - 10:30)
weeks it's not really brand new news (10:28 - 10:34)
but there is a giant life-size (10:30 - 10:36)
appleton plush that arrived in japan (10:34 - 10:38)
they are very large (10:36 - 10:40)
not that large like not as large as the (10:38 - 10:42)
zeraora life-size plush or the fur at (10:40 - 10:44)
life-size plush because appleton is not (10:42 - 10:46)
actually that big of a pokemon (10:44 - 10:49)
i had to do a little digging here so on (10:46 - 10:51)
the japanese pokemon center (10:49 - 10:54)
it is 8 500 yen (10:51 - 10:58)
which i think is like 75 usd (10:54 - 11:00)
which isn't too bad uh it's you know (10:58 - 11:01)
it's (11:00 - 11:03)
a lot cheaper than the five hundred (11:01 - 11:05)
dollar mareep plush (11:03 - 11:08)
it's a large boy though very happy (11:05 - 11:11)
appleton's could be ladies as well well (11:08 - 11:13)
i'm buying the boy version (11:11 - 11:15)
so i can put them on my couch next to my (11:13 - 11:18)
cats and go look at those boys (11:15 - 11:21)
you're a fool yeah he's uh they're (11:18 - 11:22)
pretty large (11:21 - 11:24)
and we have no clue if it's coming to (11:22 - 11:26)
the united states i guess the (11:24 - 11:29)
marie plush eventually arrived but the (11:26 - 11:30)
furret plush (11:29 - 11:33)
did not i suppose you could import it (11:30 - 11:35)
you could probably find a (11:33 - 11:37)
somebody in japan to walk to the pokemon (11:35 - 11:39)
center buy it to you and put it in a box (11:37 - 11:40)
and send it but (11:39 - 11:42)
i would suppose that would be very (11:40 - 11:44)
expensive shipping wise (11:42 - 11:46)
because of the size of the box that's (11:44 - 11:48)
real heavy here's the 200 (11:46 - 11:51)
youtube video idea you buy it and then (11:48 - 11:54)
you cut into it like an apple pie (11:51 - 11:55)
it's like buying one of those iphones (11:54 - 11:57)
and smashing it you're just doing it (11:55 - 12:01)
do you know appleton's wait that's the (11:57 - 12:05)
okay that's not flat bowl okay yes (12:01 - 12:07)
appleton's pokedex entry literally says (12:05 - 12:09)
that children would rip off strips of (12:07 - 12:10)
its back (12:09 - 12:13)
yeah to eat as snacks did you know that (12:10 - 12:16)
that's sick yeah it's terrible it's it's (12:13 - 12:18)
a slow poketail thing (12:16 - 12:20)
or the farfetch thing except that it's (12:18 - 12:22)
socially acceptable (12:20 - 12:24)
well it can probably regrow it back i'm (12:22 - 12:25)
assuming (12:24 - 12:28)
okay let me rip off strips of your back (12:25 - 12:29)
as snackers (12:28 - 12:33)
and see probably throw that back (12:29 - 12:36)
i'm not a pie nor a dragon kind of look (12:33 - 12:37)
like a pie to me (12:36 - 12:39)
if i was a pie it would be uh (12:37 - 12:41)
[Laughter] (12:39 - 12:45)
if you were a pie you would be what is (12:41 - 12:46)
like the most (12:45 - 12:49)
boring lemon meringue right there (12:46 - 12:53)
what no one likes lemon meringue (12:49 - 12:55)
it's just hanging favorite pie lemon (12:53 - 12:57)
bread is delicious (12:55 - 13:00)
all right take it back i'll be the lemon (12:57 - 13:01)
meringue (13:00 - 13:04)
no you can't beat lemon meringue pick (13:01 - 13:06)
your own pie (13:04 - 13:09)
i do like apple pie though what yeah (13:06 - 13:10)
what that's appleton (13:09 - 13:13)
yeah that's true can i be like a (13:10 - 13:14)
chocolate pie (13:13 - 13:16)
yeah you can be french silk yeah now (13:14 - 13:17)
we're talking (13:16 - 13:20)
yeah that's not (13:17 - 13:20)
that's a pie i mean theoretically (13:20 - 13:26)
i mean if lemon ranks by french silica (13:24 - 13:27)
pie true (13:26 - 13:29)
we covered this last week but we'll go (13:27 - 13:30)

post i think there's a there's a new (17:07 - 17:10)
raid pokemon coming but (17:09 - 17:13)
i think it's next week i think it's this (17:10 - 17:14)
week (17:13 - 17:16)
and then the cino event starts on (17:14 - 17:18)
tuesday january (17:16 - 17:21)
12th remakes confirmed yeah (17:18 - 17:24)
finally i'm in it finally which remakes (17:21 - 17:27)
they just forgot during the space event (17:24 - 17:28)
do you think they're gonna remake for (17:27 - 17:30)
the 25th anniversary they're gonna (17:28 - 17:31)
remake (17:30 - 17:34)
kanto again i think you're going to make (17:31 - 17:35)
it playable on the switch (17:34 - 17:38)
we can only hope (17:35 - 17:38)
well there there was that rumor that (17:39 - 17:42)
they were doing like the master (17:40 - 17:43)
collection (17:42 - 17:46)
oh right which i'll (17:43 - 17:50)
i'll i'll say it's a pretty weak rumor (17:46 - 17:52)
but i'll i'll maybe we haven't talked (17:50 - 17:53)
about this but (17:52 - 17:57)
uh the concept of the master collection (17:53 - 18:00)
i'm doing air quotes here remember we're (17:57 - 18:00)
in rumor (18:00 - 18:02)
territory was that it was going to be a (18:00 - 18:04)
switch version (18:02 - 18:07)
of red gold (18:04 - 18:11)
and ruby on one cartridge (18:07 - 18:14)
so those three games and then blue (18:11 - 18:15)
silver and (18:14 - 18:18)
sapphire on another cartridge and that (18:15 - 18:19)
it would be (18:18 - 18:22)
gosh i wanted to say it was between 40 (18:19 - 18:23)
and 60 dollars (18:22 - 18:26)
but you would get those three games on a (18:23 - 18:27)
cart (18:26 - 18:29)
and it would be a master collection and (18:27 - 18:30)
that was pretty much (18:29 - 18:34)
the rumor and i guess that's probably (18:30 - 18:37)
fine i guess i don't know what (18:34 - 18:40)
why they just why they should do (18:37 - 18:42)
individual cartridges and make us pay (18:40 - 18:42)
like (18:42 - 18:44)
thirty dollars for each one for each (18:42 - 18:45)
which they (18:44 - 18:48)
they'll package them all together thirty (18:45 - 18:49)
dollars each (18:48 - 18:53)
eighty nine ninety nine four three (18:49 - 18:56)
yeah i i i wouldn't be like upset if it (18:53 - 18:57)
came out (18:56 - 19:00)
as somebody who has recently in the last (18:57 - 19:01)
like (19:00 - 19:04)
year played all of those games (19:01 - 19:06)
i'm definitely not in the market to go (19:04 - 19:08)
back to red and blue anymore (19:06 - 19:10)
not either but that doesn't stop (19:08 - 19:12)
especially when like (19:10 - 19:15)
if you have the means like fire red leaf (19:12 - 19:16)
green i think is like a better version (19:15 - 19:17)
of those games (19:16 - 19:21)
and then if if you are a pokemon fan and (19:17 - 19:22)
you just played let's go pikachu let's (19:21 - 19:23)
go eevee (19:22 - 19:25)
you're probably one of the many people (19:23 - 19:27)
that have gotten your full (19:25 - 19:30)
scoop of kanto i mean i think i've (19:27 - 19:31)
played (19:30 - 19:34)
at least three different versions of (19:31 - 19:36)
kanto at this point i'm trying to think (19:34 - 19:37)
of all the ones because there was (19:36 - 19:41)
the first ones uh fire red and leaf (19:37 - 19:42)
green (19:41 - 19:46)
let's go eevee let's go pikachu (19:42 - 19:48)
i don't i think that's the only options (19:46 - 19:49)
are those it are those the three big (19:48 - 19:50)
remakes (19:49 - 19:53)
of kanto yeah i mean they put i i think (19:50 - 19:55)
the thing that people always bring up (19:53 - 19:56)
too is they put red and blue on the (19:55 - 19:57)
virtual console (19:56 - 19:59)
yeah but they also put yellow on the (19:57 - 20:01)
virtual controller and and (19:59 - 20:04)
golden silver and crystal and they wait (20:01 - 20:04)
they waited (20:04 - 20:08)
they waited until people bought gold and (20:04 - 20:10)
silver to put crystal out at a later (20:08 - 20:11)
date (20:10 - 20:15)
here's how's about this for a (20:11 - 20:18)
underground dark theory they (20:15 - 20:22)
make all no that doesn't work dag (20:18 - 20:25)
nabit i was gonna say they make the uh (20:22 - 20:28)
like game boy and gameboy advance (20:25 - 20:30)
games available on the switch through (20:28 - 20:32)
the nintendo online service virtual (20:30 - 20:33)
console (20:32 - 20:35)
but there's no game boy game boy advance (20:33 - 20:37)
virtual console it's only (20:35 - 20:40)
nintendo and super nintendo yeah there's (20:37 - 20:43)
not even nintendo 64 stuff right (20:40 - 20:46)
no no dagon i wish there was (20:43 - 20:49)
man gen 3 is i know it's your favorite (20:46 - 20:50)
region greg but (20:49 - 20:52)
original gen 3 is real hard to go back (20:50 - 20:54)
to all of them are really hard to go (20:52 - 20:55)
back here i tried to go back to yellow i (20:54 - 20:57)
really loved that game and i got halfway (20:55 - 20:58)
through it before i'm like (20:57 - 21:03)
i can't i can't play this so yesterday (20:58 - 21:05)
it is so frustrating to go so far (21:03 - 21:07)
backwards (21:05 - 21:09)
um and i have since played emerald many (21:07 - 21:10)
times (21:09 - 21:14)
after that and it is what was considered (21:10 - 21:17)
fun gameplay back then (21:14 - 21:20)
because it was your only option does not (21:17 - 21:20)
translate to (21:20 - 21:25)
fun gameplay now you know it's it's the (21:20 - 21:28)
it's the classic wow conundrum like (21:25 - 21:31)
i remember it was fun because i had no (21:28 - 21:33)
other option but the minute something (21:31 - 21:35)
was better i was happy to jump (21:33 - 21:37)
it's the same thing like i having all of (21:35 - 21:40)
those restrictions of those old games (21:37 - 21:42)
trying to play them now it's so (21:40 - 21:43)
frustrating to me because (21:42 - 21:47)
i want to do things faster (21:43 - 21:48)
or in a different way or have the (21:47 - 21:50)
quality of life changes and they just (21:48 - 21:51)
aren't there (21:50 - 21:53)
and it's such a frustrating experience (21:51 - 21:54)
for me (21:53 - 21:56)
i think what's going to happen is when (21:54 - 21:58)
we are (21:56 - 22:01)
eventually in retirement homes and (21:58 - 22:03)
enjoying a slower pace of life we're (22:01 - 22:05)
going to turn to those really (22:03 - 22:09)
slow paced heavy grind (22:05 - 22:12)
games and be like all right now i have (22:09 - 22:12)
the time (22:12 - 22:14)
and patience for this garbage if there (22:12 - 22:16)
was like a reason to go back and (22:14 - 22:21)
play them like the cool thing about (22:16 - 22:24)
crystal like when crystal came out there (22:21 - 22:26)
was really nothing to play pokemon wise (22:24 - 22:30)
because i believe crystal was after (22:26 - 22:33)
ultrasound ultramoon i think i think so (22:30 - 22:36)
so and and you know ultrasound ultramoon (22:33 - 22:36)
was (22:36 - 22:39)
november crystal came out i believe in (22:36 - 22:40)
in (22:39 - 22:43)
february so a lot of casual pokemon (22:40 - 22:44)
players (22:43 - 22:48)
they got their fill of pokemon and then (22:44 - 22:50)
they got different games for christmas (22:48 - 22:51)
where different games came out in (22:50 - 22:52)
january (22:51 - 22:54)
and then crystal came back and people (22:52 - 22:55)
like old pokemon games (22:54 - 22:57)
nothing wrong with that and so they came (22:55 - 22:59)
back for crystal and crystal seemed like (22:57 - 23:00)
a (22:59 - 23:02)
not like a big event but like uh like a (23:00 - 23:04)
little bump of like everyone's talking (23:02 - 23:05)
about pokemon again (23:04 - 23:08)
um and that was cool but at least when (23:05 - 23:09)
you went back to crystal (23:08 - 23:13)
or even the older games you could try (23:09 - 23:14)
one transfer those pokemon to pokemon (23:13 - 23:16)
bank (23:14 - 23:18)
um which i would assume if there was (23:16 - 23:20)
ever if this rumor was remotely true and (23:18 - 23:21)
there was a master collection or (23:20 - 23:22)
something (23:21 - 23:24)
of old games being put on the switch (23:22 - 23:26)
eventually i would assume that would be (23:24 - 23:27)
the case (23:26 - 23:29)
if they can make if they made it work (23:27 - 23:31)
before they can make it work again (23:29 - 23:32)
oh yeah everything goes into pokemon (23:31 - 23:34)
home now (23:32 - 23:35)
yeah but there's no going forward (23:34 - 23:37)
without that connectivity even pokemon (23:35 - 23:39)
shuffle goes into pokemon home (23:37 - 23:41)
at this point yeah but the cool thing (23:39 - 23:42)
about like (23:41 - 23:44)
the older games on the virtual console (23:42 - 23:45)
like crystal and stuff (23:44 - 23:47)
is if you caught a pokemon you would at (23:45 - 23:49)
least know that it would be guaranteed (23:47 - 23:52)
hidden ability and so it was like oh i (23:49 - 23:53)
could go back to another game yeah (23:52 - 23:57)
nostalgia well look at (23:53 - 23:57)
these gym leaders oh jasmine's here (23:57 - 24:02)
but you're like oh at least i caught him (24:00 - 24:04)
a reap and now it's a hidden (24:02 - 24:07)
hidden ability mureep but sword and (24:04 - 24:08)
shield kind of knocked down all those (24:07 - 24:10)
barriers to be like (24:08 - 24:12)
well it's pretty easy to get hidden (24:10 - 24:14)
ability or not hidden ability or (24:12 - 24:18)
timid or jolly or adamant or perfect ivs (24:14 - 24:21)
except they made it too easy yeah too (24:18 - 24:22)
easy (24:21 - 24:25)
so there would have to be another i feel (24:22 - 24:26)
like there would have to be something (24:25 - 24:28)
the other reason to go back to crystal (24:26 - 24:32)
was they put the celebi thing in it (24:28 - 24:34)
which was excluded from the american (24:32 - 24:35)
stuff uh which (24:34 - 24:38)
which i think was pretty smart and they (24:35 - 24:40)
gave you the ability to (24:38 - 24:43)
shiny han celebi if you cared to do so (24:40 - 24:44)
so they they gave you kind of like two (24:43 - 24:46)
reasons to go back to crystal one like (24:44 - 24:49)
easier hidden ability guaranteed pokemon (24:46 - 24:50)
and like that chris (24:49 - 24:51)
that celebi event that you could (24:50 - 24:54)
experience that that doesn't exist in (24:51 - 24:56)
gold and silver (24:54 - 24:59)
that was specifically a crystal event i (24:56 - 25:01)
guess they could put like no the deoxys (24:59 - 25:03)
event was for emerald right it wasn't (25:01 - 25:05)
for ruby and sapphire (25:03 - 25:07)
yeah it was framework they can get away (25:05 - 25:08)
with putting out (25:07 - 25:11)
old games and doing nothing to them (25:08 - 25:11)
maybe (25:11 - 25:13)
maybe i'm just not in the market for (25:11 - 25:14)
them i'm not sure (25:13 - 25:17)
why i would need to go (25:14 - 25:20)
back to emerald as i or not emerald ruby (25:17 - 25:22)
and sapphire as i just played them (25:20 - 25:23)
pretty recently (25:22 - 25:25)
and well that's you you play too much (25:23 - 25:27)
pokemon yeah that's my real problem (25:25 - 25:28)
yeah that's true i should really like (25:27 - 25:30)
start a podcast or something where i (25:28 - 25:32)
talk about how much pokemon i play (25:30 - 25:34)
no see this is the problem you need to (25:32 - 25:36)
do the opposite of that (25:34 - 25:38)
you just need to like take a six month (25:36 - 25:41)
vacation from pokemon play (25:38 - 25:43)
i don't know what's a good alternative (25:41 - 25:45)
to pokemon (25:43 - 25:48)
um you'll come back fresh no would you (25:45 - 25:50)
stop with your yu-gi-oh (25:48 - 25:54)
no not allowed well i i have like the (25:50 - 25:56)
i have i've had some time off of twitch (25:54 - 25:57)
because uh (25:56 - 25:59)
i wanted to spend time with irene and (25:57 - 26:01)
stuff and she was cooking dinner (25:59 - 26:03)
and i thought well like the players cup (26:01 - 26:05)
is coming up uh maybe i should do a (26:03 - 26:06)
couple practice matches (26:05 - 26:08)
so i'm on the couch i think it was the (26:06 - 26:10)
first time ever since sword and shield (26:08 - 26:12)
came out i'm playing pokemon on an (26:10 - 26:13)
actual tv (26:12 - 26:14)
because normally i'm playing it in front (26:13 - 26:17)
of my you know stream setup (26:14 - 26:18)
she's like what are you doing and i was (26:17 - 26:19)
like i'm just practicing for the (26:18 - 26:20)
player's cup and she's like you're (26:19 - 26:22)
working turn this off and i was like (26:20 - 26:27)

we are back from our break before we get (29:40 - 29:45)
to our uh (29:44 - 29:48)
retrospective article before we go to (29:45 - 29:50)
the wayback machine (29:48 - 29:52)
bringing it back any update for you on (29:50 - 29:53)
the masters end (29:52 - 29:56)
greg like how bad my polls have been (29:53 - 29:58)
i mean is that what we want to talk (29:56 - 30:00)
about because they've been awful (29:58 - 30:02)
have you done the uh n event at all i (30:00 - 30:03)
have not started it yet (30:02 - 30:06)
i did the an event up until fighting end (30:03 - 30:06)
because i need (30:06 - 30:10)
to have a 125 team and blah blah blah (30:06 - 30:13)
blah and i'm like nah um it's (30:10 - 30:16)
the storyline is interesting like it's (30:13 - 30:17)
interesting (30:16 - 30:20)
it's an interesting add-on to the end of (30:17 - 30:22)
what happened in those series like a lot (30:20 - 30:23)
of these things are (30:22 - 30:25)
um so there's some cute moments in there (30:23 - 30:26)
uh i (30:25 - 30:30)
i haven't done the new year's eve events (30:26 - 30:33)
um but i i guess there's a a moment (30:30 - 30:34)
where (30:33 - 30:37)
you call lance out on gyarados not being (30:34 - 30:37)
a dragon (30:37 - 30:39)
oh that's cute which makes me laugh (30:37 - 30:42)
because his response is (30:39 - 30:43)
ha ha ha not all dragons are dragging (30:42 - 30:46)
type pokemon this is right (30:43 - 30:50)
i agree i agree i'm with you dude (30:46 - 30:53)
he's not wrong (30:50 - 30:53)
one one of the good things i will say (30:55 - 30:58)
one of the good (30:57 - 31:01)
things they do in masters which is (30:58 - 31:03)
not their pull system not their banner (31:01 - 31:05)
system and not the actual gameplay (31:03 - 31:09)
is who's ever writing their characters (31:05 - 31:13)
for the story lines has these people (31:09 - 31:16)
down like i don't think there's been (31:13 - 31:19)
a storyline that i haven't been (31:16 - 31:20)
interested in (31:19 - 31:24)
found charming or been like wow like the (31:20 - 31:25)
even (31:24 - 31:27)
even the fact that like cyrus is like i (31:25 - 31:29)
still hate people and i still think the (31:27 - 31:30)
world should be destroyed (31:29 - 31:33)
but i guess i'll hang out here at least (31:30 - 31:35)
they should have acknowledged that whole (31:33 - 31:36)
weirdness and just like this is who he (31:35 - 31:37)
is (31:36 - 31:38)
there's there's a number of things i (31:37 - 31:40)
think are really the writing in that (31:38 - 31:41)
game (31:40 - 31:42)
is really good it's probably one of the (31:41 - 31:45)
only things that keeps me coming back (31:42 - 31:48)
is i enjoy what they do with the (31:45 - 31:49)
characters (31:48 - 31:51)
whereas like the game doesn't bring me (31:49 - 31:52)
much in my polls i've (31:51 - 31:56)
i've pulled on every banner every time (31:52 - 31:59)
i have not gotten any any of th i'm so (31:56 - 31:59)
far (31:59 - 32:03)
out of ten polls got two five stars that (31:59 - 32:04)
weren't uh (32:03 - 32:06)
weren't the people on the banner i (32:04 - 32:07)
always post my (32:06 - 32:10)
recaps of what i pull on youtube and my (32:07 - 32:12)
last (32:10 - 32:15)
video i don't think i pulled anything (32:12 - 32:15)
good (32:15 - 32:18)
spoiler my luck has also been bad (32:15 - 32:20)
although they did give 3 000 gems for (32:18 - 32:21)
the new year (32:20 - 32:23)
from logging in yep i think n is (32:21 - 32:24)
available until (32:23 - 32:26)
close to the end of the month and then (32:24 - 32:29)
lance and lily are available (32:26 - 32:31)
until the 13th i don't know that the (32:29 - 32:33)
lily in rabambi (32:31 - 32:35)
is any good i just want that pair yeah (32:33 - 32:36)
they're very cute (32:35 - 32:39)
they're very cute i really want that (32:36 - 32:39)
pair (32:39 - 32:41)
and but i have not gotten that full (32:39 - 32:43)
disclosure i am partnered with dna (32:41 - 32:46)
uh but i will say really now i will say (32:43 - 32:47)
the main reason i come to the game is (32:46 - 32:49)
because i do like to collect the (32:47 - 32:50)
characters (32:49 - 32:52)
but uh i i like getting one of every (32:50 - 32:53)
character (32:52 - 32:56)
and i missed out on erica i never (32:53 - 33:00)
got her now i gotta wait a whole year (32:56 - 33:02)
well assuming she's coming back it could (33:00 - 33:03)
be (33:02 - 33:05)
like regalia lost where they have (33:03 - 33:06)
christmas in july and the christmas (33:05 - 33:08)
events came back in july oh (33:06 - 33:11)
uh interesting there was there was a (33:08 - 33:13)
question i saw (33:11 - 33:14)
floating around the internet i won't say (33:13 - 33:16)
where of (33:14 - 33:19)
whether pokemon masters will even last (33:16 - 33:21)
till next christmas and the only reason (33:19 - 33:23)
that is brought up (33:21 - 33:26)
is because pokemon duel (33:23 - 33:30)
lasted i want to say almost two years (33:26 - 33:33)
and rumble world or whatever it was (33:30 - 33:33)
called (33:33 - 33:36)
only lasted a year (33:33 - 33:39)
magikarp jump was never like a well (33:36 - 33:41)
maybe to some people it was a lifelong (33:39 - 33:42)
game (33:41 - 33:45)
i i am a i'm a jump lifer (33:42 - 33:48)
uh but i still jump every day but i (33:45 - 33:49)
think (33:48 - 33:52)
i think masters is doing or has been (33:49 - 33:53)
doing (33:52 - 33:55)
better than at least well any anything (33:53 - 33:57)
in the entire world was doing better (33:55 - 33:58)
than rumble (33:57 - 34:00)
yeah i think there's still more people (33:58 - 34:02)
playing it i don't think it's as much (34:00 - 34:04)
but that's pretty normal but i think (34:02 - 34:06)
i'll be around for a while (34:04 - 34:09)
i mean yeah i don't see why it would end (34:06 - 34:10)
before (34:09 - 34:12)
its second anniversary especially with (34:10 - 34:14)
this year being the 25th (34:12 - 34:16)
year i think if anything come february (34:14 - 34:17)
they would probably (34:16 - 34:22)
do some sort of event to correspond (34:17 - 34:24)
with the 25th anniversary and to (34:22 - 34:25)
probably (34:24 - 34:27)
that would be their big push of like (34:25 - 34:29)
okay we need to do something (34:27 - 34:31)
because pokemon is on the brain for a (34:29 - 34:32)
lot of people (34:31 - 34:35)
and how do we put butts into masters i (34:32 - 34:37)
mean i think masters is a sufficiently (34:35 - 34:39)
popular game (34:37 - 34:42)
yeah that it's yeah i mean the fact that (34:39 - 34:44)
those other games died out is because (34:42 - 34:45)
nobody was playing them (34:44 - 34:47)
right right people are actually playing (34:45 - 34:48)
masters (34:47 - 34:51)
and spending money on it so i mean yes (34:48 - 34:53)
it's not making as much money as pokemon (34:51 - 34:54)
go (34:53 - 34:57)
but what it is exactly last thing before (34:54 - 34:58)
we move on (34:57 - 35:00)
i don't try i always try to keep our (34:58 - 35:02)
masters talks under 10 minutes otherwise (35:00 - 35:04)
you got 10 minutes to knit or crochet (35:02 - 35:06)
yeah right (35:04 - 35:08)
cross stitch are people get a cross (35:06 - 35:10)
stitch in 2021 is that a thing that's (35:08 - 35:11)
going to come back (35:10 - 35:13)
what do you mean it never went away dude (35:11 - 35:14)
we (35:13 - 35:17)
had people who appeared on this program (35:14 - 35:19)
who are adamant cross you need to be in (35:17 - 35:21)
our crafty scrafty group (35:19 - 35:23)
in the slack community but i'm not (35:21 - 35:24)
crafty or scrafty (35:23 - 35:27)
you can still see everyone's beautiful (35:24 - 35:29)
cross stitch project (35:27 - 35:31)
i'll jump in it'd be one of the many (35:29 - 35:32)
things that i'm like oh (35:31 - 35:34)
i have to read this last question for (35:32 - 35:35)
you greg did you (35:34 - 35:38)
notice the difference between um every (35:35 - 35:40)
four minutes versus every six minutes (35:38 - 35:41)
for the refresh (35:40 - 35:43)
no because i literally play once a day (35:41 - 35:45)
okay so you're probably why is this a (35:43 - 35:46)
question for greg maybe i started (35:45 - 35:48)
playing pokemon masters (35:46 - 35:52)
did you no you could try it though you (35:48 - 35:54)
did try it you didn't like me (35:52 - 35:56)
there's a lot of things i don't like (35:54 - 35:58)
about it the thing is is that (35:56 - 36:01)
i'm over the stamina (35:58 - 36:05)
limit i'm keeping myself at uh 796 so (36:01 - 36:06)
that i feel back up to the top (36:05 - 36:08)
in case something comes along that i (36:06 - 36:10)
really want to do so i (36:08 - 36:13)
i i don't regenerate so i (36:10 - 36:15)
i wouldn't see it that's i used to play (36:13 - 36:17)
that way before (36:15 - 36:20)
they'd stopped giving us the plethora of (36:17 - 36:21)
stamina (36:20 - 36:24)
but now i feel like so i normally play (36:21 - 36:24)
twice a day (36:24 - 36:26)
i normally when i wake up in the morning (36:24 - 36:28)
after i'm done checking my email (36:26 - 36:30)
and if there's still a cat laying on my (36:28 - 36:32)
feet and i can't get out of bed (36:30 - 36:34)
because every morning i log log into (36:32 - 36:36)
masters (36:34 - 36:39)
and then i try not to take the 200 (36:36 - 36:42)
stamina because i don't want it to (36:39 - 36:44)
because i want it to replenish (36:42 - 36:46)
so then i just spend it on something (36:44 - 36:48)
like it literally anything (36:46 - 36:50)
normally it's like oh i don't have time (36:48 - 36:51)
to think i'll just (36:50 - 36:55)
you know do sync orbs or i'll just do (36:51 - 36:58)
soda plus red minus two four (36:55 - 37:01)
six eight whatever the sodas are called (36:58 - 37:02)
and then at night (37:01 - 37:05)
before i go to bed i log in to see how (37:02 - 37:07)
much sam and i have and then to cash in (37:05 - 37:08)
the 200 (37:07 - 37:11)
because that only lasts 24 hours and (37:08 - 37:12)
then try to spend that so then when i (37:11 - 37:14)
wake up in the morning it's (37:12 - 37:16)
refreshed that's how normally i play and (37:14 - 37:17)
i do notice that (37:16 - 37:20)
well obviously i mean you didn't need (37:17 - 37:22)
the game to be out to like calculate (37:20 - 37:24)
how much damage you get versus six (37:22 - 37:26)
months for four minutes (37:24 - 37:30)
it's more full more often (37:26 - 37:33)
yeah yeah i just don't i don't play any (37:30 - 37:34)
of my gadget games (37:33 - 37:37)
like down to down to zero unless there's (37:34 - 37:37)
some (37:37 - 37:40)
some massive event where i have to get (37:37 - 37:42)
to the end to get the reward and then i (37:40 - 37:42)
will (37:42 - 37:44)
but then usually i only play once a day (37:42 - 37:46)
to get (37:44 - 37:48)
to get my login and do stuff i i tend (37:46 - 37:50)
not to think of these games apart from (37:48 - 37:52)
the one time that they forced me to log (37:50 - 37:54)
in probably because i'm paying i i just (37:52 - 37:56)
play too many of them (37:54 - 37:58)
and so i sort of cycle through them and (37:56 - 37:59)
then i'm like okay i need i need to do (37:58 - 38:01)
something else with my life (37:59 - 38:03)
i will say it's a lot harder for me to (38:01 - 38:05)
play more than once when i'm at home and (38:03 - 38:06)
i have more compelling things that i (38:05 - 38:08)
want to play (38:06 - 38:12)
like i could be spending time (38:08 - 38:12)
playing this or i could be playing (38:12 - 38:18)
oxygen not included or sword and shield (38:15 - 38:19)
or (38:18 - 38:23)
final fantasy 14 uh so i just (38:19 - 38:25)
if i was trapped in my office on a (38:23 - 38:27)
conference call that was boring (38:25 - 38:28)
like when i go back to work i might play (38:27 - 38:30)
it more because i might be back on (38:28 - 38:33)
on calls again all right i wanted to uh (38:30 - 38:36)
revisit an old article (38:33 - 38:39)
this is uh from usgamer we did talk (38:36 - 38:40)
about this on the show (38:39 - 38:46)
this was published june 13th 2019 (38:40 - 38:49)
about 18 months ago what is the title of (38:46 - 38:49)
this (38:49 - 38:52)
i don't think that it doesn't look like (38:49 - 38:53)
there is a title (38:52 - 38:55)
[Laughter] (38:53 - 38:57)
the i guess the title is the pokemon (38:55 - 38:59)
sword and shield interview (38:57 - 39:01)
quote we knew at some point we weren't (38:59 - 39:03)
going to be able to keep indefinitely (39:01 - 39:04)
supporting (39:03 - 39:06)
all pokemon end quote we talked to (39:04 - 39:08)
gamefreak about battle potential of (39:06 - 39:09)
dynamics (39:08 - 39:11)
the decision to narrow down the number (39:09 - 39:12)
of available pokemon (39:11 - 39:16)
and to move into a new era um so we (39:12 - 39:18)
won't go over this whole interview but (39:16 - 39:21)
i remember we we covered an old (39:18 - 39:22)
interview (39:21 - 39:25)
a couple months ago and a lot of people (39:22 - 39:26)
came out of the woodwork (39:25 - 39:28)
that's an expression right yes that is (39:26 - 39:29)
the expression (39:28 - 39:33)
used correctly i'm quite impressed 2021 (39:29 - 39:36)
i get we've grown we're beating around (39:33 - 39:37)
the bush (39:36 - 39:41)
once again no we're not we're not (39:37 - 39:41)
like sand through our fingers (39:45 - 39:49)
so i at this point this is this is (39:49 - 39:53)
before sword and shield even came out (39:51 - 39:56)
this is june 13th um this is a couple (39:53 - 39:57)
days (39:56 - 40:00)
after the e3 (39:57 - 40:04)
announcement so before we dive in let's (40:00 - 40:07)
kind of okay before we dive in why are (40:04 - 40:08)
we going back to this (40:07 - 40:12)
why one because it's a slow new suite (40:08 - 40:12)
has anyone told japan that we're (40:14 - 40:18)
revisiting this article (40:16 - 40:20)
good did anyone tell america that they (40:18 - 40:24)
launched pikachu into space (40:20 - 40:27)
did they so there was no plushie shoved (40:24 - 40:29)
out of an airlock nothing no (40:27 - 40:31)
there was nobody said pikachu is sush (40:29 - 40:33)
and ejected him and tossed him (40:31 - 40:37)
pikachu is sus that is (40:33 - 40:40)
the slogan of 2021 pikachu (40:37 - 40:44)
is kinda suss kinda well i i actually (40:40 - 40:46)
dug up this article to argue with (40:44 - 40:47)
somebody on the internet about (40:46 - 40:50)
oh good and you're dragging us into your (40:47 - 40:50)
argument (40:50 - 40:54)
no because i oh no no the answer is (40:50 - 40:57)
yes the argument's irrelevant but when i (40:54 - 40:59)
when i dug up the article because i was (40:57 - 41:00)
like (40:59 - 41:01)
because the article specifically i was (41:00 - 41:03)
looking for the interview where they (41:01 - 41:04)
talked about (41:03 - 41:07)
how max raid battles in sword and shield (41:04 - 41:09)
and max ray battles in pokemon go were (41:07 - 41:11)
developed at the same time (41:09 - 41:13)
which his article does state okay and (41:11 - 41:16)
then i was rereading the article (41:13 - 41:17)
earlier this week and i was like wow (41:16 - 41:20)
there's it's kind of interesting (41:17 - 41:23)
how we had thoughts and (41:20 - 41:25)
our minds went to a bunch of different (41:23 - 41:26)
places and then sword and shield came (41:25 - 41:28)
out and now it feels like (41:26 - 41:30)
this is a brand new article again even (41:28 - 41:31)
though i've read it probably a hundred (41:30 - 41:33)
times before sword and shield came out (41:31 - 41:36)
so i wanted to i wanted to revisit it uh (41:33 - 41:38)
because now we've had two dlcs (41:36 - 41:39)
sword and shield has been out for a year (41:38 - 41:41)
we're a month away from the 25th (41:39 - 41:42)
anniversary (41:41 - 41:46)
and so i thought it would be fun um as i (41:42 - 41:46)
figured (41:46 - 41:49)
this week of news would be terribly (41:46 - 41:53)
short so i'm going to make will (41:49 - 41:56)
be amore here okay (41:53 - 42:00)
and i will a morty i will i will be (41:56 - 42:03)
the interviewer which one are we going (42:00 - 42:03)
with (42:03 - 42:06)
which question uh let's (42:03 - 42:10)
go with the pokemon go one which is (42:06 - 42:14)
second question below the video it goes (42:10 - 42:16)
and for max raids did you look to (42:14 - 42:17)
pokemon (42:16 - 42:19)
go for inspiration for raid battles that (42:17 - 42:21)
are in that (42:19 - 42:23)
and what do you feel you're going to do (42:21 - 42:24)
with sword and shield that will take (42:23 - 42:27)
max raid battles to the next level i (42:24 - 42:28)
think both (42:27 - 42:30)
features were being developed around the (42:28 - 42:31)
same time (42:30 - 42:34)
both the pokemon go raid battles and (42:31 - 42:36)
and max raid battles while we were (42:34 - 42:38)
working on development (42:36 - 42:41)
of the game really with a similar goal (42:38 - 42:43)
of having more ways for players to kind (42:41 - 42:45)
of play with each other (42:43 - 42:47)
specifically what we wanted to do with (42:45 - 42:50)
max raid battles was give a cooperative (42:47 - 42:51)
battle experience (42:50 - 42:54)
you can always battle against friends (42:51 - 42:55)
but that kind of pvp (42:54 - 42:58)
oriented competitive play can be (42:55 - 42:59)
intimidating to some (42:58 - 43:02)
players we wanted to offer an experience (42:59 - 43:04)
where you can easily get a friend and (43:02 - 43:05)
have them join you on something where (43:04 - 43:07)
you can challenge a really strong (43:05 - 43:09)
opponent and have a good time (43:07 - 43:12)
okay so how does that hold up uh having (43:09 - 43:15)
a good time (43:12 - 43:15)
that's i mean i've had some good times (43:16 - 43:20)
i've had a lot of good times with raids (43:19 - 43:22)
i've had a lot of good times like (43:20 - 43:25)
the really challenging part one is is (43:22 - 43:27)
only when they did the mewtwo stuff and (43:25 - 43:30)
some dynamics avengers otherwise (43:27 - 43:33)
it was pretty much for people (43:30 - 43:36)
have you done dynamics adventures though (43:33 - 43:36)
i mean (43:36 - 43:39)
people are bad at pokemon no see that's (43:36 - 43:40)
the thing is (43:39 - 43:42)
right greg you have to take this from (43:40 - 43:43)
the perspective of somebody who doesn't (43:42 - 43:45)
think pokemon (43:43 - 43:48)
all the time every week there are plenty (43:45 - 43:48)
of people (43:48 - 43:51)
who just don't realize how tough and (43:48 - 43:53)
impressive (43:51 - 43:55)
that's relicanth is we go that's true i (43:53 - 43:56)
mean i have no sock (43:55 - 43:58)
this is a this is a small sample of the (43:56 - 44:00)
pokemon world but you know i have (43:58 - 44:02)
a bunch of people watching me play (44:00 - 44:04)
pokemon every day like they're in my (44:02 - 44:05)
twitch chat they're (44:04 - 44:07)
they're chit chatting i'm i'm do i'm (44:05 - 44:08)
playing pokemon every (44:07 - 44:12)
day you know no no shade to them (44:08 - 44:15)
but when i do max raid battles with them (44:12 - 44:18)
there are just basic battle things that (44:15 - 44:18)
they (44:18 - 44:21)
don't know and it's fine there's like (44:18 - 44:22)
800 some (44:21 - 44:26)
moves and there's 600 pokemon available (44:22 - 44:28)
but when they're in a battle and they (44:26 - 44:30)
use something like steel roller (44:28 - 44:32)
and there's no terrain up well like (44:30 - 44:34)
steel roller is going to fail it needs (44:32 - 44:35)
terrain and (44:34 - 44:37)
you wasted a whole move and that move (44:35 - 44:38)
could be (44:37 - 44:41)
like the i have done i (44:38 - 44:45)
i have done landorus look i don't know (44:41 - 44:46)
what is in max raid battles i only know (44:45 - 44:48)
at the end that landorus appears (44:46 - 44:50)
if there are other pokemon that appear (44:48 - 44:52)
at the end of a max raid battle i don't (44:50 - 44:53)
know who they are (44:52 - 44:55)
i only also need to own up to the person (44:53 - 44:57)
who doesn't pay attention and has (44:55 - 44:59)
brought a storm drain (44:57 - 45:01)
pokemon and then complains why so and so (44:59 - 45:02)
isn't using water gun (45:01 - 45:04)
all the time when they are and your (45:02 - 45:06)
pokemon is the one that's eating it up (45:04 - 45:09)
but you need to own your own behavior (45:06 - 45:10)
sbj (45:09 - 45:12)
look if i have an opportunity to pick (45:10 - 45:15)
miraculous i'll pick miractus (45:12 - 45:17)
i know but then you gotta pay attention (45:15 - 45:18)
enough to not complain (45:17 - 45:20)
that people in your chat aren't playing (45:18 - 45:22)
right when you're the one that is (45:20 - 45:24)
ruining the mo (45:22 - 45:27)
i tell people not to use the water move (45:24 - 45:28)
when i get miraculous (45:27 - 45:31)
yeah after you remember i have watched (45:28 - 45:32)
you many times when you're like (45:31 - 45:34)
what why are they using water gun and (45:32 - 45:36)
chad has to say because you brought (45:34 - 45:39)
a storm drain steve hey i started off (45:36 - 45:41)
this conversation saying people were bad (45:39 - 45:42)
at pokemon (45:41 - 45:45)
there's no lies including you no lies (45:42 - 45:46)
have been detected (45:45 - 45:48)
you also started out by saying i play it (45:46 - 45:50)
professionally 24 (45:48 - 45:53)
7. i don't know entertainment pokemon (45:50 - 45:54)
master (45:53 - 45:57)
playing for years (45:54 - 46:00)
but even even like the amount of times (45:57 - 46:01)
i've (46:00 - 46:04)
i've gone to into landorus and i'm like (46:01 - 46:05)
hey we should maybe take the grass path (46:04 - 46:07)
and people are like oh anders is flying (46:05 - 46:09)
ground it's like yet one lander says no (46:07 - 46:11)
any flying type moves trust me i've (46:09 - 46:12)
battled it (46:11 - 46:14)
eight million times two it knows two (46:12 - 46:15)
ground type moves (46:14 - 46:19)
one is bulldoze one is earthquake and (46:15 - 46:23)
grass pokemon resist ground and if you (46:19 - 46:26)
set up grassy terrain not only do (46:23 - 46:28)
grass pokemon resist ground but grassy (46:26 - 46:30)
terrain (46:28 - 46:31)
halves the amount of damage from (46:30 - 46:33)
earthquake and halves the amount of (46:31 - 46:34)
damage from bulldoze (46:33 - 46:36)
for every pokemon in the field it's very (46:34 - 46:38)
very good against landorus (46:36 - 46:41)
and a lot of people don't know that and (46:38 - 46:41)
we've (46:41 - 46:44)
i have failed my fair share of landorus (46:41 - 46:45)
raids (46:44 - 46:48)
i will say i think dynamaxx adventure is (46:45 - 46:48)
a (46:48 - 46:52)
better system than max (46:48 - 46:56)
raid battles in the terms of (46:52 - 46:59)
being a bit more challenging and (46:56 - 47:00)
requiring you to think (46:59 - 47:04)
but i don't think that max (47:00 - 47:08)
raid battles should go away (47:04 - 47:10)
and or should be harder i think there is (47:08 - 47:12)
a good balance between of like (47:10 - 47:14)
this this is a little bit harder this is (47:12 - 47:15)
a little bit easier (47:14 - 47:16)
but they could make it harder like they (47:15 - 47:18)
did with mewtwo (47:16 - 47:23)
um or the five star zera aura (47:18 - 47:25)
that was shiny was like harder right i'm (47:23 - 47:26)
almost positive (47:25 - 47:29)
yes but that was hard to find yeah but (47:26 - 47:30)
those were the two challenges like (47:29 - 47:33)
mewtwo and then like the shiny zero aura (47:30 - 47:34)
and there was really nothing you didn't (47:33 - 47:36)
really get anything from chinese aurora (47:34 - 47:37)
it was just like bragging rights that (47:36 - 47:39)
you were able to beat it but it would (47:37 - 47:42)
feel weird going into a future pokemon (47:39 - 47:43)
game (47:42 - 47:47)
if there wasn't this kind of co-op (47:43 - 47:48)
and i don't want i don't want to be one (47:47 - 47:50)
of those people that hang on to sos (47:48 - 47:52)
forever or horde battles because that's (47:50 - 47:53)
what i always hear is like i wish they (47:52 - 47:55)
would bring back horde battles i wish (47:53 - 47:57)
they would bring back sos (47:55 - 48:00)
those are mechanics that existed for (47:57 - 48:00)
either (48:00 - 48:03)
you know shiny hunting or fast eevee (48:00 - 48:04)
training (48:03 - 48:08)
or hidden abilities but that's totally (48:04 - 48:09)
different than (48:08 - 48:12)
a co-op feature which i think does add a (48:09 - 48:13)
lot of value (48:12 - 48:16)
for this game and for future games if i (48:13 - 48:17)
can say like (48:16 - 48:18)
hey on monday night we're going to get a (48:17 - 48:20)
bunch of people together and we're going (48:18 - 48:20)
to play (48:20 - 48:23)
together you know kind of like an mmo (48:20 - 48:27)
yeah oh you mean like pokemon go yeah (48:23 - 48:32)
but better with a storyline (48:27 - 48:32)
and hey listen in pokemon go you're the (48:32 - 48:38)
storyline (48:35 - 48:38)
it's a pretty bad storyline let's do (48:38 - 48:43)
the question below will what do you (48:41 - 48:45)
envision the end game and single player (48:43 - 48:46)
post game (48:45 - 48:48)
content is going to be like in terms of (48:46 - 48:50)
what people can do after they beat the (48:48 - 48:51)
campaign (48:50 - 48:52)
a lot of people want to play a little (48:51 - 48:55)
bit longer so what do you plan on doing (48:52 - 48:56)
are you looking for additional updates (48:55 - 48:59)
or anything like that i can't really say (48:56 - 49:00)
too much today of course (48:59 - 49:03)
but i do want to say it's not just the (49:00 - 49:04)
story (49:03 - 49:06)
and then you're done with the game we've (49:04 - 49:08)
got a lot of content for players to (49:06 - 49:08)
enjoy (49:08 - 49:11)
after they finish the story also for (49:08 - 49:13)
players who are really big fans of the (49:11 - 49:14)
battle system (49:13 - 49:15)
and the competitive scene there's going (49:14 - 49:18)
to be a lot for them to engage with (49:15 - 49:22)
i think that is a true response yeah (49:18 - 49:25)
they're on season seven series (49:22 - 49:29)
series seven series seven but season (49:25 - 49:32)
twelve of the game so that means the (49:29 - 49:33)
rule (49:32 - 49:36)
so seasons are monthly so every season (49:33 - 49:38)
you can qualify for master rank which (49:36 - 49:40)
gives you 600 battle points three golden (49:38 - 49:42)
bottle caps dynite ore (49:40 - 49:44)
armoritor etc and you can earn up to (49:42 - 49:46)
1200 if you place (49:44 - 49:49)
both single and double battles battle (49:46 - 49:50)
points (49:49 - 49:53)
but series where on series 7 means rule (49:50 - 49:54)
changes (49:53 - 49:58)
so for example series 1 you couldn't use (49:54 - 50:00)
a lot of gmax pokemon (49:58 - 50:03)
um and like gmax lapras i think was (50:00 - 50:04)
introduced in series (50:03 - 50:08)
four and then series six (50:04 - 50:11)
was the ban uh of like incineroar and (50:08 - 50:12)
rillaboom (50:11 - 50:16)
and togekiss and dragapult and series 7 (50:12 - 50:18)
added the crown tundra legendaries which (50:16 - 50:19)
is why (50:18 - 50:22)
landorus is back and so we know that (50:19 - 50:22)
series (50:22 - 50:26)
8 will be february and we don't know the (50:22 - 50:27)
rules for that we don't know if that's (50:26 - 50:28)
going to be (50:27 - 50:29)
another ban we don't know if that's (50:28 - 50:32)
going to be like guess what you can use (50:29 - 50:33)
mewtwo now (50:32 - 50:34)
even though mewtwo's not good people (50:33 - 50:36)
would probably use like kyogre groudon (50:34 - 50:37)
because those are actually pretty decent (50:36 - 50:39)
for players who are really big fans of (50:37 - 50:40)
the battle system and competitive scene (50:39 - 50:41)
there's gonna be a lot to engage with (50:40 - 50:44)
that sentence is is very very true (50:41 - 50:47)
although they probably didn't expect a (50:44 - 50:49)
global pandemic but i think they pivoted (50:47 - 50:50)
pretty well (50:49 - 50:53)
as we're having now the third player cup (50:50 - 50:53)
coming up (50:53 - 50:56)
players cup coming up a lot of content (50:53 - 50:57)
for people to enjoy after the story that (50:56 - 50:59)
could be a reference to the dlc (50:57 - 51:03)
but they have changed raids every month (50:59 - 51:05)
there was the the post game story line (51:03 - 51:06)
with sword (51:05 - 51:09)
burt and shield (51:06 - 51:09)
i think that still counts as just story (51:11 - 51:15)
there is what else can you do after you (51:15 - 51:19)
do the game (51:18 - 51:21)
you can go to the rose tower yeah (51:19 - 51:22)
explore the wild (51:21 - 51:24)
area i guess yeah because after you beat (51:22 - 51:26)
leon technically you open up all the (51:24 - 51:27)
weather conditions for the wild area (51:26 - 51:29)
because you can't (51:27 - 51:31)
i'm almost positive before you beat leon (51:29 - 51:33)
you're not allowed to get fog (51:31 - 51:36)
in the wild area at all no what (51:33 - 51:40)
yeah it's like they're i think fog and (51:36 - 51:41)
then something else (51:40 - 51:42)
doesn't ever happen in the wild area (51:41 - 51:45)
until you beat leon are you making that (51:42 - 51:48)
up no i'm not (51:45 - 51:50)
i mean maybe i'm hallucinating it but i (51:48 - 51:52)
think yeah something along those lines (51:50 - 51:54)
but there there is a couple wild area (51:52 - 51:56)
things that are restricted until after (51:54 - 51:57)
you beat leon (51:56 - 51:58)
there's something else that you can do (51:57 - 52:01)
after you beat the game (51:58 - 52:04)
huh i guess you you can't get fog until (52:01 - 52:05)
you beat the (52:04 - 52:07)
what hey see you know what i've never (52:05 - 52:08)
done i've (52:07 - 52:11)
i have never gone back to pier's gym to (52:08 - 52:12)
battle marnie (52:11 - 52:15)
that's a thing you can do is it really (52:12 - 52:16)
yeah (52:15 - 52:19)
yeah i've never done it me either (52:16 - 52:20)
because i didn't know that that was a (52:19 - 52:21)
thing (52:20 - 52:22)
yeah because she takes over as gym (52:21 - 52:24)
leader right but i don't know what piers (52:22 - 52:26)
does (52:24 - 52:28)
he's a rock star dude he's too early i (52:26 - 52:29)
thought she was just (52:28 - 52:30)
outside and he was still the gym leader (52:29 - 52:32)
am i oh well i haven't done it so i (52:30 - 52:33)
don't know the story (52:32 - 52:37)
i mean i think i've seen her outside man (52:33 - 52:38)
there's a lot that i don't it's been a (52:37 - 52:41)
long it's been i mean i guess (52:38 - 52:43)
catching zashian or zamasu well that's (52:41 - 52:45)
part of the story burt shielberg (52:43 - 52:46)
storyline (52:45 - 52:48)
yeah you have there's a whole thing you (52:46 - 52:51)
have to do to unlock her as a gym (52:48 - 52:53)
battle and i don't think i've done that (52:51 - 52:55)
you can complete your career decks (52:53 - 52:57)
that's another thing still i've never (52:55 - 52:58)
done that oh yeah me (52:57 - 53:01)
i'm so behind in sword and shield stuff (52:58 - 53:02)
but i'm (53:01 - 53:05)
gonna get there someday yeah i mean (53:02 - 53:06)
what's gonna happen is when they (53:05 - 53:08)
announce whatever the next iteration of (53:06 - 53:09)
the (53:08 - 53:13)
console based games greg yes be (53:09 - 53:16)
wary of the words that you speak but (53:13 - 53:18)
whenever they announce the next (53:16 - 53:20)
iteration of whatever the games are (53:18 - 53:22)
going to be for the console games i will (53:20 - 53:23)
get a fire under me (53:22 - 53:25)
to complete everything in sword and (53:23 - 53:27)
shield so that i'll be ready for the (53:25 - 53:28)
next games (53:27 - 53:30)
i mean i spent two years breeding a (53:28 - 53:32)
shiny (53:30 - 53:34)
bug team and i'm like crawling through (53:32 - 53:35)
pokemon (53:34 - 53:37)
shield with it do you see sword and (53:35 - 53:40)
shield being a kind of jumping off point (53:37 - 53:41)
for future poke for the future of the (53:40 - 53:42)
pokemon series (53:41 - 53:44)
because you're not only watching sword (53:42 - 53:46)
and shield but also pokemon home (53:44 - 53:48)
pokemon bank and a lot of things coming (53:46 - 53:49)
up around it does it feel like this is a (53:48 - 53:52)
new era in the pokemon series (53:49 - 53:54)
all right i'm a different guy this time (53:52 - 53:56)
i'm mr janichi (53:54 - 53:58)
or do you want to be masuda greg you be (53:56 - 54:01)
masuda i think it might be fair to say (53:58 - 54:01)
it's not a (54:01 - 54:05)
transition but for example at game freak (54:01 - 54:06)
omori-san is the director for these (54:05 - 54:08)
games who are passing a lot of (54:06 - 54:10)
responsibility to the younger generation (54:08 - 54:12)
to kind of move the franchise forward (54:10 - 54:14)
also being on the nintendo switch allows (54:12 - 54:16)
for new play styles (54:14 - 54:19)
not just handheld but also on the tv (54:16 - 54:20)
screen (54:19 - 54:21)
i think it's definitely going to (54:20 - 54:24)
represent a new chapter for pokemon (54:21 - 54:26)
pokemon game is appealing to like a (54:24 - 54:28)
younger crowd like every pokemon game is (54:26 - 54:30)
eventually somebody's first pokemon game (54:28 - 54:32)
well that's not what they mean by (54:30 - 54:33)
younger generation it just means that mr (54:32 - 54:34)
massoud is (54:33 - 54:37)
ready to retire and hand off the reins (54:34 - 54:39)
onto somebody else (54:37 - 54:40)
i know we've talked about this on the (54:39 - 54:42)
show before but obviously (54:40 - 54:44)
that was probably a long time ago and we (54:42 - 54:45)
brought up masuda (54:44 - 54:47)
and masuda gets a lot of blame if (54:45 - 54:51)
anything in pokemon goes wrong (54:47 - 54:51)
so so amore was the director (54:51 - 54:57)
of sword and shield they were the (54:54 - 54:58)
director (54:57 - 55:02)
of sun and moon and then they were also (54:58 - 55:02)
the director (55:02 - 55:06)
of omega ruby alpha sapphire (55:02 - 55:08)
so those were the three main games they (55:06 - 55:10)
directed they've (55:08 - 55:12)
obviously they were a producer um let's (55:10 - 55:13)
go pikachu let's go eevee they were a (55:12 - 55:14)
producer on (55:13 - 55:17)
ultrasound ultra moon they were a (55:14 - 55:19)
planning director on x and y i don't (55:17 - 55:20)
know the difference between a planning (55:19 - 55:22)
director and a director (55:20 - 55:24)
but whatever whatever that means yeah it (55:22 - 55:26)
doesn't make a difference (55:24 - 55:29)
and then for masuda they were a director (55:26 - 55:32)
on crystal although they weren't (55:29 - 55:34)
completely in charge of crystal they (55:32 - 55:34)
were (55:34 - 55:37)
a director on ruby and sapphire on fire (55:34 - 55:39)
red leaf green (55:37 - 55:43)
on diamond and pearl on black and white (55:39 - 55:47)
on x and y and on let's go pikachu let's (55:43 - 55:48)
go eevee (55:47 - 55:50)
those were the games masuda was the (55:48 - 55:52)
director on (55:50 - 55:54)
and masuda has done a lot more than just (55:52 - 55:56)
direct obviously masuda did a lot of (55:54 - 55:57)
music (55:56 - 55:59)
um they've done scenario plot they've (55:57 - 56:01)
done story plot they've done (55:59 - 56:04)
world design have done they did all the (56:01 - 56:05)
music for sun and moon x and y (56:04 - 56:06)
black two white two black and white (56:05 - 56:08)
heart gold soul silver diamond pearl (56:06 - 56:10)
fire red leaf green ruby sapphire let's (56:08 - 56:11)
go pikachu let's go eevee (56:10 - 56:15)
so they didn't do music for (56:11 - 56:16)
omega ruby f sapphire i'm sure they did (56:15 - 56:18)
some music but they weren't in charge of (56:16 - 56:20)
like the entire soundtrack (56:18 - 56:22)
uh there has been a lot of focus on (56:20 - 56:24)
collaborative play as well i mentioned (56:22 - 56:26)
the ray battles already but it feels (56:24 - 56:26)
like (56:26 - 56:28)
this one is trying to do a lot of (56:26 - 56:30)
multiplayer things was it important (56:28 - 56:33)
that pokemon also be cooperative as well (56:30 - 56:35)
as competitive (56:33 - 56:37)
and how much did you weigh those two (56:35 - 56:38)
sides of pokemon (56:37 - 56:40)
yeah i think it's more of a sense of (56:38 - 56:42)
getting a lot of players to play (56:40 - 56:42)
together (56:42 - 56:44)
maybe not necessarily cooperatively but (56:42 - 56:45)
playing together (56:44 - 56:48)
in a game world a shared kind of space (56:45 - 56:49)
almost (56:48 - 56:51)
one of the cool things about nintendo (56:49 - 56:53)
switch is obviously you can take it with (56:51 - 56:53)
you (56:53 - 56:55)
so you go out and maybe go to a friend's (56:53 - 56:57)
house and you can cooperate together (56:55 - 56:58)
like oh let's do a match (56:57 - 57:00)
now and you take on this really strong (56:58 - 57:02)
pokemon but communication has always (57:00 - 57:04)
been a central theme to pokemon (57:02 - 57:06)
so having more ability to communicate (57:04 - 57:08)
not just through traditional features (57:06 - 57:10)
but also talking to each other while (57:08 - 57:12)
going up against a single opponent (57:10 - 57:13)
that kind of cooperative stuff is (57:12 - 57:15)
definitely the focus (57:13 - 57:19)
then they should fix the wacom oh (57:15 - 57:22)
i mean dynamics adventure is like (57:19 - 57:25)
the better the better way to connect it (57:22 - 57:26)
absolutely is just give me an (57:25 - 57:28)
eight-digit code what's your code (57:26 - 57:30)
all right cool we're together we don't (57:28 - 57:32)
have to worry about friend codes or (57:30 - 57:35)
whether i can see you on a list and also (57:32 - 57:36)
seeing other people (57:35 - 57:39)
in the wild area is not the best (57:36 - 57:40)
experience (57:39 - 57:43)
no no it would be (57:40 - 57:47)
nice if there was a way to find your (57:43 - 57:48)
friends easier (57:47 - 57:51)
oh definitely again whether there was (57:48 - 57:53)
like an eight digit code of like i want (57:51 - 57:54)
to enter this wild (57:53 - 57:57)
area maybe next game even even if there (57:54 - 57:58)
was a way to (57:57 - 58:01)
turn the y com to just friends list (57:58 - 58:04)
only if there's just not everybody in (58:01 - 58:06)
the world but there was a middle thing (58:04 - 58:06)
like (58:06 - 58:09)
only people on my friends list would be (58:06 - 58:09)
nice (58:09 - 58:13)
because trying to like we're all in the (58:09 - 58:14)
same area (58:13 - 58:16)
but it's randomly picking five people (58:14 - 58:17)
from the world to show me instead of the (58:16 - 58:19)
people who are on my friends list (58:17 - 58:20)
it's so frustrating i've definitely (58:19 - 58:22)
found friends in the wild (58:20 - 58:25)
area yeah i have two but (58:22 - 58:25)
by accident not because the game made it (58:26 - 58:29)
easy (58:28 - 58:30)
it was like all right let's go i'll go (58:29 - 58:32)
to the island i'm going to be spinning (58:30 - 58:33)
this is what i'm wearing (58:32 - 58:35)
all right you leave the wild area keep (58:33 - 58:37)
coming back in back and forth all right (58:35 - 58:37)
we found (58:37 - 58:39)
each other back and forth okay the game (58:37 - 58:40)
is finally chosen (58:39 - 58:42)
because it would be fun to be able to do (58:40 - 58:43)
more camping with people (58:42 - 58:45)
like i might complete my curry decks if (58:43 - 58:47)
i did that yeah that was kind of like (58:45 - 58:50)
the main thing is i mean seeing another (58:47 - 58:51)
person is (58:50 - 58:54)
cool but you can't really do anything (58:51 - 58:55)
with them besides like talk to them and (58:54 - 58:57)
get like sausage from them (58:55 - 59:01)
um yeah but they did design something to (58:57 - 59:02)
do with somebody which is (59:01 - 59:06)
the curry i mean to be (59:02 - 59:09)
fair it's easy to do if you're offline (59:06 - 59:11)
and in the same room together (59:09 - 59:14)
that's true that is true that has just (59:11 - 59:15)
not been (59:14 - 59:18)
uh a thing for for a bit but just like (59:15 - 59:20)
every video game it's more fun with (59:18 - 59:22)
people and if i'm sitting there making (59:20 - 59:23)
curry by myself (59:22 - 59:26)
it would be it's just it's just a better (59:23 - 59:27)
experience and (59:26 - 59:30)
um at least for me people that were (59:27 - 59:32)
watching my streams were not interested (59:30 - 59:33)
in curry (59:32 - 59:36)
but until they saw me do it and when we (59:33 - 59:37)
did find people (59:36 - 59:39)
in the area and we were all doing it (59:37 - 59:41)
together other people were like wow this (59:39 - 59:43)
is cool because you guys are doing it (59:41 - 59:44)
together i want to do it together which (59:43 - 59:45)
is probably (59:44 - 59:48)
part of the reason why sword shield is (59:45 - 59:48)
has done (59:48 - 59:51)
very well compared to past pokemon games (59:48 - 59:54)
one in the sense that the switch is (59:51 - 59:56)
incredibly popular (59:54 - 59:59)
um but two is because (59:56 - 60:02)
when you add i feel my opinion when you (59:59 - 60:03)
add co-op (60:02 - 60:06)
stuff to games it is easier to get (60:03 - 60:07)
people to (60:06 - 60:10)
participate and be excited and extend (60:07 - 60:12)
the longevity of that because you're (60:10 - 60:14)
doing something with somebody else (60:12 - 60:18)
like an mmo greg yep yep yep yep (60:14 - 60:22)
that's what i'm waiting for 20 20 25 (60:18 - 60:25)
pokemon world i'm excited for it (60:22 - 60:30)
on the switch pro (60:25 - 60:32)
3x5 last question here is talking about (60:30 - 60:35)
dynmax adventure how do you feel that (60:32 - 60:36)
changes the way players are going to (60:35 - 60:38)
approach pokemon and what sort of (60:36 - 60:40)
opportunities did you add to change the (60:38 - 60:42)
way people play pokemon battles (60:40 - 60:44)
it's going to add a whole new layer a (60:42 - 60:46)
tactical element to the battles (60:44 - 60:49)
we've had power up gameplay features (60:46 - 60:51)
like mega evolution and z moves in the (60:49 - 60:52)
past (60:51 - 60:54)
but dynamaxx is something that can be (60:52 - 60:57)
used with any pokemon in the game (60:54 - 60:59)
so that gives the chance for any pokemon (60:57 - 61:00)
to shine in battle (60:59 - 61:02)
it also kind of creates a situation (61:00 - 61:04)
where you have to read your opponent (61:02 - 61:06)
because you don't know which pokemon (61:04 - 61:09)
they're going to power up in battle (61:06 - 61:09)
so as a competitive player how true (61:09 - 61:15)
is that i mean when you see the list of (61:12 - 61:17)
four pokemon (61:15 - 61:19)
how often are you actually surprised at (61:17 - 61:24)
which one dynamax is (61:19 - 61:27)
it 50 50 is it like 25 (61:24 - 61:29)
of the time it's i didn't expect that (61:27 - 61:31)
like what what's your percentage (61:29 - 61:33)
i think the thing is like you you have (61:31 - 61:35)
multiple pokemon you can dynamax (61:33 - 61:38)
right so if i'm looking at a team and i (61:35 - 61:40)
see they have a grim snarl (61:38 - 61:42)
i i could probably say with confidence (61:40 - 61:44)
99 of the time the grim snarl is (61:42 - 61:48)
not going to dynamics but also like the (61:44 - 61:49)
same with dust clops (61:48 - 61:50)
you know dust collapse is a support (61:49 - 61:52)
pokemon it's normally there to set up (61:50 - 61:53)
trick room (61:52 - 61:55)
it might know willowist it probably (61:53 - 61:57)
knows nightshade it might know a move to (61:55 - 61:59)
activate weakness policy like brick (61:57 - 62:01)
break or bulldoze or shadow sneak (61:59 - 62:04)
but it's not there to do damage (62:01 - 62:07)
but with that being said i've seen top (62:04 - 62:08)
players (62:07 - 62:10)
specifically on the ladder and when i (62:08 - 62:12)
say top players i mean like (62:10 - 62:15)
top 100 in the world i've seen a player (62:12 - 62:18)
dynamax their dust clops because that (62:15 - 62:21)
was their win condition they dynamaxed (62:18 - 62:22)
it they used (62:21 - 62:26)
max phantasm and they were able to win (62:22 - 62:28)
in that situation is it rare yeah (62:26 - 62:31)
totally i would say probably like 99.9 (62:28 - 62:33)
percent of the time you're not going to (62:31 - 62:34)
dynamax desktops but (62:33 - 62:37)
because you have the option to it can (62:34 - 62:37)
still (62:37 - 62:39)
add a variance to the battle and they (62:37 - 62:41)
were they they won (62:39 - 62:43)
um because they dynamax the dusk claps (62:41 - 62:45)
uh but when you see like certain pokemon (62:43 - 62:47)
you can expect those dynomax like (62:45 - 62:50)
gla glass glass trier is a probably (62:47 - 62:51)
going to be (62:50 - 62:54)
the dynamaxxer charizard probably going (62:51 - 62:55)
to be the dynamaxer (62:54 - 63:00)
metagross cortana like (62:55 - 63:00)
these are pokemon that you can look at (63:00 - 63:04)
and go yeah they're probably going to (63:02 - 63:05)
dynamax those (63:04 - 63:06)
or when you look at their team you're (63:05 - 63:08)
like well how does their team beat my (63:06 - 63:09)
team (63:08 - 63:11)
and this is probably the one they're (63:09 - 63:12)
going to dynamax (63:11 - 63:16)
so to compare that to older games which (63:12 - 63:18)
i don't have that (63:16 - 63:20)
level of knowledge for compared to sword (63:18 - 63:21)
and shield (63:20 - 63:24)
uh i mean if you saw kangaskhan on a (63:21 - 63:26)
team in (63:24 - 63:28)
in like x and y or omega ruby or sun and (63:26 - 63:29)
moon you (63:28 - 63:32)
go well there's no way (63:29 - 63:35)
it's not running their mega stone and if (63:32 - 63:36)
you (63:35 - 63:39)
there were certain pokemon like tapacoco (63:36 - 63:40)
where you were (63:39 - 63:42)
very very confident that it was going to (63:40 - 63:43)
have a z (63:42 - 63:45)
move attached to it um because that's (63:43 - 63:47)
just how the meta was (63:45 - 63:50)
at the time there is always going to be (63:47 - 63:54)
some sort of gimmick (63:50 - 63:56)
to pokemon even in black and white i (63:54 - 63:58)
guess the gimmick was (63:56 - 64:01)
um the gems the gem system and that's (63:58 - 64:02)
why (64:01 - 64:05)
tornadoes and thunder or not tornadoes (64:02 - 64:07)
yeah tornadoes and thunderous were (64:05 - 64:09)
pretty good because they would run like (64:07 - 64:10)
one attack and it would be like (64:09 - 64:13)
acrobatics maybe hallucia too (64:10 - 64:15)
and then acrobatics was like stronger if (64:13 - 64:17)
the pokemon wasn't holding a held item i (64:15 - 64:18)
think (64:17 - 64:20)
yeah so you would get the gem boost (64:18 - 64:21)
initially it would consume the gem and (64:20 - 64:23)
then the move would still be just as (64:21 - 64:24)
powerful (64:23 - 64:26)
um so gems were kind of like baby z (64:24 - 64:27)
moves and (64:26 - 64:30)
as much as people still loved mega (64:27 - 64:31)
evolution (64:30 - 64:32)
again i talked about this all the time (64:31 - 64:34)
but there was only like (64:32 - 64:38)
10 pokemon that really took advantage of (64:34 - 64:40)
mega evolution there were a lot more (64:38 - 64:42)
pokemon that took advantage of z moves (64:40 - 64:43)
or could take advantage of z moves you (64:42 - 64:46)
could maybe make the argument that only (64:43 - 64:49)
x amount of pokemon dynamax (64:46 - 64:51)
but i would probably say that's like (64:49 - 64:53)
triple the amount of pokemon that could (64:51 - 64:54)
mega evolve (64:53 - 64:56)
i mean i i have a team right now that (64:54 - 64:58)
has porygon on it (64:56 - 65:00)
and i have probably done close to like (64:58 - 65:02)
150 battles (65:00 - 65:05)
but in the 150 battles i have dynamaxx (65:02 - 65:06)
porygon once (65:05 - 65:08)
and i dynamaxed it in a position in a (65:06 - 65:10)
situation where i won (65:08 - 65:12)
i won because i dynamics porygon and out (65:10 - 65:15)
of 150 battles i only did it once but it (65:12 - 65:16)
worked (65:15 - 65:19)
and i won with it so i don't think (65:16 - 65:21)
dynamaxx is going to last forever though (65:19 - 65:24)
i think there will be another gimmick (65:21 - 65:26)
in future games that they rely on (65:24 - 65:28)
because i think the gimmicks are what (65:26 - 65:30)
sell the game right like the changes (65:28 - 65:31)
yeah (65:30 - 65:33)
people will always remember sword and (65:31 - 65:35)
shield you know in 20 years of that's (65:33 - 65:37)
the game with the big pokemon (65:35 - 65:39)
just like you remember x and y is like (65:37 - 65:41)
that's the game that introduced megas (65:39 - 65:43)
and i guess you go well that's the game (65:41 - 65:45)
that introduced z (65:43 - 65:48)
moves for sun and moon (65:45 - 65:51)
so i i think dynamaxx is (65:48 - 65:54)
is cool for now but i i i expect it's (65:51 - 65:55)
not going to last forever (65:54 - 65:58)
yeah i agree that was our that was our (65:55 - 66:00)
looking back at an old article (65:58 - 66:03)
hopefully it was all right we can move (66:00 - 66:04)
on to question of the week (66:03 - 66:08)
question time let's start off the new (66:04 - 66:09)
year with a great (66:08 - 66:12)
new question (66:09 - 66:14)
welcome to the first question of 2021 (66:12 - 66:17)
make it good steve (66:14 - 66:20)
ah there's a there's there's a lot of (66:17 - 66:22)
good ones here (66:20 - 66:25)
maybe maybe we could speed run these (66:22 - 66:25)
let's do it all right let's go brandon (66:25 - 66:29)
if you were at the pokemon company you (66:28 - 66:31)
could make the event for the 25th (66:29 - 66:33)
anniversary what would it be and how (66:31 - 66:35)
would it work (66:33 - 66:37)
thanks that's a real speed run question (66:35 - 66:39)
sure (66:37 - 66:43)
so like we're talking like not like (66:39 - 66:45)
okay to limit this down in-game event or (66:43 - 66:46)
like up (66:45 - 66:49)
uh buy tickets to go to event (66:46 - 66:52)
which we want i would say you do (66:49 - 66:53)
whatever you want (66:52 - 66:55)
i would say in-game event i've always (66:53 - 66:57)
been so i here i'll go first (66:55 - 67:00)
i've always been a huge fan (66:57 - 67:05)
of in-game events that celebrate (67:00 - 67:07)
the anniversary and pokemon go has been (67:05 - 67:09)
really good at doing that every year (67:07 - 67:11)
because they're like a live game and so (67:09 - 67:13)
in the (67:11 - 67:16)
sun and moon era and before that it just (67:13 - 67:18)
never seemed like they acknowledged (67:16 - 67:20)
those players (67:18 - 67:22)
uh as as easy as it was of like look (67:20 - 67:23)
give us (67:22 - 67:25)
a free decidueye or something give us (67:23 - 67:27)
something that we can download to like (67:25 - 67:27)
signify (67:27 - 67:30)
an anniversary so in the realm of games (67:27 - 67:32)
existing now (67:30 - 67:33)
that would probably be the best they (67:32 - 67:35)
could do in future games it would be (67:33 - 67:37)
cool if they could do what masters does (67:35 - 67:40)
or um which is like update the pokemon (67:37 - 67:41)
center (67:40 - 67:43)
uh yeah and i think that would be a (67:41 - 67:45)
really like not easy thing but that (67:43 - 67:45)
would be (67:45 - 67:48)
really like nice if during events or (67:45 - 67:50)
during holidays (67:48 - 67:51)
you know at least the pokemon centers (67:50 - 67:53)
throughout the region they're all the (67:51 - 67:53)
same (67:53 - 67:56)
uh could be like decorated and stuff for (67:53 - 67:58)
this anniversary (67:56 - 68:00)
i would i don't know i would expect what (67:58 - 68:02)
we're gonna get which is probably (68:00 - 68:04)
release date for detective pikachu (68:02 - 68:06)
release date for pokemon snap (68:04 - 68:08)
probably a trailer for an upcoming (68:06 - 68:09)
switch pokemon game (68:08 - 68:11)
and then like two things that we have no (68:09 - 68:12)
clue what's happening (68:11 - 68:16)
my thing for the 25 year university i (68:12 - 68:18)
so you know how we all voted on the top (68:16 - 68:20)
10 of each region (68:18 - 68:24)
yeah on google yeah that for each month (68:20 - 68:27)
those are all like one like kanto is (68:24 - 68:27)
let's say (68:27 - 68:31)
april so all max raid battles like (68:27 - 68:33)
they pick three from each for amongst (68:31 - 68:34)
the four weeks (68:33 - 68:36)
and those are special max raid battles (68:34 - 68:38)
like they make those super cool and then (68:36 - 68:40)
the next one so they switch to johto and (68:38 - 68:41)
then hoenn and all the way up to (68:40 - 68:44)
to the end of the year so like they take (68:41 - 68:46)
that list and make those (68:44 - 68:50)
uh promoted raid max raid battles (68:46 - 68:54)
uh so you'd have like a region a month (68:50 - 68:58)
i would do a pokemon arg (68:54 - 69:00)
and it just like have it be like there's (68:58 - 69:02)
a hidden clue in (69:00 - 69:04)
whatever announcement for like they do (69:02 - 69:06)
like a poster or something for (69:04 - 69:08)
celebrating 25 years of pokemon and (69:06 - 69:09)
there's a little clue in there (69:08 - 69:12)
and then you follow the clues and you (69:09 - 69:13)
have like a full year (69:12 - 69:16)
to solve the arg and then whoever (69:13 - 69:19)
wins gets to design the next a new (69:16 - 69:20)
pokemon or something (69:19 - 69:24)
there you go args that stuff's real hot (69:20 - 69:25)
right still (69:24 - 69:28)
yeah yep (69:25 - 69:28)
uh next question what this is from mark (69:29 - 69:32)

the week (75:44 - 75:50)
okay the previous (75:47 - 75:52)
oh dagnabbit i had to close it when i (75:50 - 75:55)
restarted my computer (75:52 - 75:59)
the previous week's pokemon of the week (75:55 - 76:03)
was i was in the pokemon trivia contest (75:59 - 76:05)
and i had forgotten that this pokemon (76:03 - 76:07)
existed (76:05 - 76:10)
um even though it's been around for 25 (76:07 - 76:11)
years (76:10 - 76:14)
good clue for you right there uh i (76:11 - 76:17)
always forget that it's name uh and i (76:14 - 76:19)
made a reference to gum shoes there (76:17 - 76:23)
and then uh i also mentioned that its (76:19 - 76:25)
prior evolutions follow a naming (76:23 - 76:26)
convention kind of like (76:25 - 76:29)
gibbel and gabite but instead of like (76:26 - 76:29)
garchomp (76:29 - 76:31)
the one that i'm referring to here (76:29 - 76:34)
doesn't follow the same naming pattern (76:31 - 76:37)
um and then i reference gyarados (76:34 - 76:41)
and then there's a fact that its name (76:37 - 76:42)
refers to (76:41 - 76:45)
a story in (76:42 - 76:48)
i guess the jewish tradition um (76:45 - 76:50)
but that story is actually represented (76:48 - 76:53)
by different pokemon go let and go lurk (76:50 - 76:56)
um and then uh it's i mentioned that (76:53 - 76:57)
it's (76:56 - 76:59)
shiny kind of looks like a nugget but (76:57 - 77:00)
it's not (76:59 - 77:03)
related to golden or gold duck i (77:00 - 77:08)
how much more clue could i get you guys (77:03 - 77:08)
what do you got it's (77:08 - 77:17)
goldeen or golduck no (77:13 - 77:21)
it's golem golem there you go (77:17 - 77:25)
you forgot the gold existed because (77:21 - 77:27)
i because i mean you get like a billion (77:25 - 77:28)
geodudes in life (77:27 - 77:33)

this week's pokemon will be an easy (79:44 - 79:48)
guess for you (79:46 - 79:50)
i was never able to tease her by calling (79:48 - 79:51)
her by this pokemon's name (79:50 - 79:53)
because we were divorced about five (79:51 - 79:55)
years before its debut (79:53 - 79:57)
i frequently think of this pokemon as (79:55 - 79:59)
representing a diurnal cycle (79:57 - 80:01)
and it shares typing with both of the (79:59 - 80:03)
true diurnal pokemon (80:01 - 80:05)
but it is actually representative of a (80:03 - 80:07)
different cycle (80:05 - 80:11)
one that repeats approximately 12.3601 (80:07 - 80:11)
times (80:11 - 80:14)
every calendar year oddly enough with (80:11 - 80:16)
its paired pokemon (80:14 - 80:19)
it does not represent full and new (80:16 - 80:21)
as i have been looking into this pokemon (80:19 - 80:23)
i have found that there are three (80:21 - 80:25)
pokemon that pretty much represent the (80:23 - 80:26)
same thing (80:25 - 80:28)
bonus points if you can figure out all (80:26 - 80:30)
three one is ordinary (80:28 - 80:33)
and two are legendary there you go (80:30 - 80:37)
not not too tough to start out the year (80:33 - 80:41)
