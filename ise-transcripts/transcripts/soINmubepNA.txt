[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 276 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I am your host SBJ and with me today I have will yes it was very exciting day yesterday one of my co-workers had a baby yesterday and that is the most important thing that happened yesterday Oh interesting yes okay all right we also have Travis here you know getting to listen to the Pokemon go-fast episode as an outsider looking in has really made me disappointed and unless I missed something I think all of the listeners were dying to hear whether or not you did in fact used the museum bathroom Oh III think you didn't miss something cuz I did mention that he didn't get the pass oh but it was like a real quick deal II but but can you explain yourself yeah I I used so bathroom update on Pokemon go I used the port-a-potty or you know just your basic necessity standing only for men before the park opened so I was clear in the fact that no one has used these yet and then later on in the day I found a hidden bathroom in the parking garage structure which was not as clean as I preferred but it was very private and it the the toilet the job done the toilet there flushed and that's what's important in that situation but but what did that bathroom lack well the you said you said the door was broken because you also found the bathroom and while I read the doors it's like a it's like a hidden Zelda thing that you have to do a couple of tricks to get to you found the bathroom I found the bathroom and I used my car keys to lock the door yes sorry had to manipulate the lock on the on the little swinging door so that it would stay stay lost for you I also do that okay so you know how in the back through like the stalls never go to the floor and then you're supposed to ideally like look under the stall to see if somebody's feet are there as far as I understand it depends on the country apparently the u.s. is kind of odd and having that style of stall where the stall wall does not go all the way down to the floor yeah I think I think it's weird overall I like I get it because if maybe you got stuck in it you can curl under is that really where your mind goes of getting stuck in a bathroom stall yes no no I I mean I've thought about that situation of like oh if I get stuck in here I can just crawl underneath as I'm sure we all have as we all do some days but I'm thinking oh this is so I can look at the stall and see somebody's feet and call like okay cool somebody's in there me as a paranoid public bathroom user not really paranoid but I've been in situations where I was very young in like a public school possibly or not possibly MPs where people just push open the stall and normally that the lock on those stalls aren't strong enough to stop somebody from pushing it so ever since a child what I do is I take my jacket or hoodie or sweater and I throw it over the stall door the so for the people who don't take the two seconds to look for feet they will see a a garment of clothing hanging over the stall signifying that it is occupied that's how your clothes get stolen it's true I'm the most defenseless in the bathroom so somebody could easily steal my hoodie also don't you wear like $600 jeans or something yeah yeah hopefully he's not throwing those over didn't think that through if I'm throwing jeans over the door that means I'm taking my shoes off and then we now we have a whole nother can this is a Pokemon pie yes to everyone we got an exciting show for you guys today we have some Pokemon Go news of course even though Pokemon go Fest is over we still have some what what do they could fall out to deal with in regards to that we also have some rumors regarding Ultra Sun and ultramoon that are probably fake but I thought it would be fun to read those rumors on air anyways and we have some emails for you guys and our Pokemon of the week so that's our show for you guys I do want to mention real quick we'll probably mention this more in depth and housecleaning but two things I want to mention before we start one is mica will sorry that will mic gun myself will be up this year at least we'll be at the minnesota pokey con on Saturday August 5th in Minnesota if that is enough detail for you to want to go you can look that up that's on our Twitter and our patreon and I in our subreddit August 5th Minnesota pokey con we'll be there all day did I say great was gonna be there myself Micah and Greg who is the DM for mythical we will all be there and then the other thing I want to mention real quick is the following week August 13th which is a Sunday is gonna be our live seven year anniversary show it was actually gonna be next week but because of the poky con we had to delay it one week so that will be live we'll have more details with that within the next week but that will be will Travis and I for that live show and there will be some more stuff later that day it'll be a really exciting show we have some news regarding the show and everything so very exciting day so stay tuned for that with that being said let's jump into some Pokemon news first bit of news here is this is a this is available for all regions but Tyranitar right Obama site man site tight and Agri night whoo I'm never gonna get better night yeah neck tight Menma necktie time never gonna get good at saying these they're all available for Pokemon Sun and Moon using the universal code all capitals s ABL e V o L a n T and this is the first time you will be able to get Agra night prior to anything else the other stones were available in the 2017 international challenge maith but you get all four by entering that code one more time s a B L e V o L a M T sable Volant yeah what is I'm puzzling that one out I can't what does that mean I don't know level int hmm but I keep expecting like both times Steve read it out I kept expecting okay si ble he's spelling Sableye and then he's not well this is sample black or is that bread I don't know what English what isn't sable like it's like a it's a like a little animal and then you can make it into a fur mine yeah it's a black fur a sable sable fur so flying and Volant means flying right so yeah able to fly or glide so it's either a flying black fur thing or a sublevel n't which is the cousin of malevolent hmm stables are cute they're like a little more super cute yeah this takes a lot of them to make a nice fur well at least according to Wikipedia they're in the level of least concern in terms of conservation status so it shouldn't be too sad Pokemon go update here in regards to Milwaukee parks we've been following this story very hard since it started since I'm from Milwaukee but this is off the BBC I suppose I could have found another source but hey while AB is the BBC is so incredibly unreliable as since it started right up there with the Drudge Report rules designed to stop pokemon hunters over running parks in Milwaukee County has been suspended following a legal change Milwaukee parks appeared in Pokemon go as pokey stops real-world location players visit together in games items but officials said the volume of players had unintended consequences and ordered game makers to apply for permits including to include parks in their apps the order will be suspended while legal change is considered now this is mostly regard to Lake Park where there was 21 polka stops there the complaints happened nante didn't respond it went to a couple what do they call those like hearings where people could show up and plead if they public hearings yeah they wanted poke I kicked myself all the time for not going to those because it sounded like it was pretty close but it pretty much was people coming and saying that this were ruining the parts parks and then other people coming and saying that no this is really good for the parks anyways it went from 21 Park 21 stops at Lake Park to about nine stops after the removal happened from the antic which I still don't think they commented on anyways BBC goes on and says several landmarks in the in Milwaukee parks were included as points of interest in Pokemon go when it launched in 2016 the Milwaukee County Park Service said a number of players had increased littering in the park overwhelmed toilet facilities and it all resulted in trampled grass game companies must detail on how they will deal with security waste collection and toilet provision as well as part of the application process critics said the requirement might stifle the development of mixed reality games which companies such as Microsoft and Apple are investing in in April a legal challenge was brought by a company called candy lab the company does not make Pokemon go but it is a developer of a poker app that encourages players to visit real-world locations it said video games that were protected under the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and claimed the park ordiance violated that right a preliminary injunction was granted on Thursday so the permit required can no longer be enforced until the case is heard and there you go there's your Milwaukee this isn't adding stops back to the park though which at this point I don't know what you guys think but in the antique hasn't said anything antic went ahead and remove some stops this other company comes in says that it's a First Amendment right permit is no longer enforced but I don't think me antics are gonna add those twelve stops back all of a sudden no soon I think they've got yeah I was gonna say you can you can look at it legally now that Milwaukee's first action had a chilling effect and it will dampen future investment in such opportunities in Milwaukee yeah that that's that's a good point you could certainly see it that way that people will say like well why would I want to work with Milwaukee if they're so hostile to this type of thing I think y'all would probably agree with me when I say Danny antic probably has more important things on the docket than worrying about adding stops back to Lake Park in Milwaukee Wisconsin it just seems like it to them like I don't see them caring too much about it not because like they don't care about users but just because it's such a small percentage of users who would be impacted by that yeah and at this point hardcore poke [ __ ] players in Milwaukee have found other places some more Pokemon news here all right well we'll do this one first so this is July 25th three days after Pokemon go fest ended this is an update specifically from John Hanke the CEO so there's some news in regards here but they wanted to write a letter about the about how the fest went and before before I read this Travis you weren't there and you said you listened to the episode what did what for for somebody not going to fess and then hearing that episode what what was your thoughts or takeaways from that I mean sounds like it was a bust like yeah at the end of the episode y'all were saying stuff like you know at in the end I had a good time overall and in the end it felt worth it just to hang out with people and and some of the stuff near the end was executed better but to me hearing that like that just sounds like a PR disaster for the game just in my last job I put on a lot of or not put on myself but part of my job was helping put on these public if I publish offends not quite like this at all but it certainly did give me um a lot of like vicarious stress for that for the people who end up with this event on and just hearing all the things that went wrong was cool boy I don't envy those the Niantic folks I don't envy the folks who spent a lot of money on a plane ticket to get there that it just seems like a rough situation all around I'm sure Niantic thought there would be issues but I don't think they thought that they would be down for the entire day well it's like six all right so this is again from John Hanke during Pokemon go fest 2017 in Chicago we encountered software and network problems that prevented many people from being able to connect to the game players were disappointed with their experiences that morning and we heard boos and shouts from the crowd we'd like to update you on what caused these issues while our technical team worked diligently with our event vendor and telecommunication companies to attempt to resolve the issues I spent nearly the entire day talking face to face with into attendees so did much of the team of the Niantic staff who came to Chicago to support the event during the hours I spent talking to n attendees I passed on the information we had communicated of our policy and refunds and game credits once we had them but mostly I listened to what players had to say certainly many were upset and I did my best to listen and offer any assistance I could some were able to play normally more on that later and more than a few unknown pokemon were captured by those gathering around to Hauk among those who came up to me many shared stories of how important the game was to them some talked about losing weight others talked about a path to recovery after a serious illness and some talked about repaired relationships with children siblings and parents many friends many groups of friends who had traveled together to talked about how the shared bond the game created for them for those stories I am grateful because it was obviously incredibly stressful and disappointing day for all of us both I personally and then and all of Niantic apologize for the inconvenience and frustration what happened technical issues with our game software caused the client to crash and interfered with the gameplay for some users the gameplay issues were resolved with a server configuration changed and the crashes were also addressed for many but not all users a more protracted problem was caused by over saturation of mobile data networks and some network providers this caused many attendees to be unable to access pokemon go or other Internet services network congestion also led to a login issue which affected some users being able to access the Internet this laitanan this latency related login issue was addressed with a second Niantic configuration change well I don't know if you got this I remember the not being able to login that only lasted like 25 minutes a half hour maybe yeah yeah that that was not the the length of the day it was really like after you were logged in either getting kicked out or just like pokey stops not loading or you're trying to capture Pokemon and you throw the ball and it just like crashes at that point so people were in they just couldn't do stuff once they were in it was almost I think it was what they said here after the first update it went smoothly and then all of a sudden no one could even log in and that lasted for about 25 minutes and then people could log in but then it was back to the the first issue of nothing actually loading continuing this on the peer network access issue we provided details estimates on attendance and acquired data throughout per-user to our event partner who worked with the major carriers to allow them to plan for adequate coverage some carriers deployed cellular on wheels cows to extend their capacity in other cases the providers deemed them unnecessary based on their other inference truck infrastructure already in place on the site users reported different levels of success on these providers Wi-Fi was enabled by one provider as a solution which helped some users but not all sprint was an on-site official partner deployed a cow and their network was busy but held up well although many players were able to play normally for the majority of the day many were not and based on that we had a number of adjustments to the event plan okay so let's break down in this paragraph because I think this is the first bit of new information hanky says that some some cellular networks provided cows I'm pretty sure we only know that one did which was sprint they provided one cellular on wheels and they did talk about how one provider provided Wi-Fi we know who that was for sure that was 18 t yeah definitely where you could pick it up which yeah 18 t provider Wi-Fi 8 worked pretty much for me flawlessly throughout the event except for the 25 minutes with a no login issue but if I was on 18 T Wi-Fi I had no problem playing the game for the most of the day but that Wi-Fi only covered maybe 1/8 of the park yeah if even that much yeah but I yeah I didn't see any other cells on wheels so unless they had them outside the big gates like and didn't bring them on the inside because I don't know what they look like well it looks like do you know what a cell tower looks like like radio tower do you know have you ever seen like a cherry picker yeah yeah a cherry picker alright so it's smaller than that but similar in that it kind of like extends up like that but here's the trick there's usually cables coming out of it that hard link into a you know the wired internet like it doesn't it's not freestanding you have to have white you know cables coming out of it that go to the carriers actual physical infrastructure so that's how you notice them because you see those cables going out and being like they're really really thick cables and they go off to either like a manhole so they can go underground to where like the fiber networks and what are the little things call that the phone companies have Wow my terminal in my head no no no no no it's it's the stations where all the telephones get together into one place well there's a term for phone con 2016 yeah exactly the hub it's not a hub it's got a really it like these called like this central exchange or the central off I think it's just called the central office there's one of them up the street for me when you come visit me I'll point it out to you but they've got a hook into the wired infrastructure somehow and then that tower can then augment cellular but but you know still transporting it into the wired so not seeing any towers with cables thick cables coming out of them and going into hidden secret underground chambers to me means they weren't there unless they were outside of the park because you know we were inside that gated area of the park which I never mentioned was truly impressive to me that they can throw up an ad-hoc fence around that entire size of that park unit like that fence is removable yeah yeah it's pretty amazing to me going back on the peer network access issue we provided detailed estimates on attendance and required data throughout per user to our event partner who worked with the majority characters to allow them to a plan for adequate coverage is the event partner Grant Park is that that is that the situation there no I think it's whatever company did actual event production because obviously Atlantic is not a specialist in event production so it's whatever that company was there there are people who actually specialize in even management and putting these kinds of things on well clearly not after this oh and the words that you were going for their throughput and carrier yeah that's what I said there you go it's just frustrating and I'm sure it's even more frustrating for nee antic to say hey we're gonna have a lot of people here twenty thousand to be to be accurate because even even when we were talking to the producer will somebody another reporter was like how many people are here and the producer was like less than twenty thousand and she's like can I get an exact number and he's like our permit allowed for up to twenty thousand people there were no more than twenty thousand people in this part and that and then he also said that includes staff Oh interesting cuz they probably had about probably 200 minimum but still that's nineteen thousand eight hundred people players I just submit there was a horrible miscommunication somewhere or somebody like did the very arbitrary oh this really isn't that important decision and it turns out to the that was the most important of all the decision but even if you're in the antic and they come back i none of us had verizon here but I'm pretty sure Verizon had the most issues because Irene was on Sprint and Irene was playing more than most of us were like I said the eighteen t wife I work for me if you're in the antic and Verizon comes back and tells the event partner now we don't need to bring out a cow and the event partner tells the antic hey we're not like Verizon's not bringing out a cow orange don't you as the antic push back and say we don't we'll pay for the cow just bring the cow out anyways like who's lying and I'm Verizon for the USA I mean typically you don't have to pay for them because the carrier's want their network to work where people are but the response from Verizon is going to be don't have a cow man my guess I imagine is the situation of that probably happened and that carriers still said though I mean you could see why from Verizon or AT&T or probably not sprint but the other twos perspectives like this probably doesn't seem that important to them you know like I don't yeah maybe that's just me as I say or they just didn't really believe that 20,000 people were gonna play out yes show up to play Pokemon early in the afternoon we inform players that we could that we would refund tickets to those who wanted it and we would grant $100 USD and pokey coins to all attendees due to their inconvenience we also released the unique Pokemon spawning at the event to their surrounding neighborhoods to give people a way to catch them where their mobile network was stronger doesn't say here but they extended that radius to miles around Grant Park later in the afternoon we announced the winner of the challenge and let players know that all attendees would receive a legendary Pokemon in their accounts that was lugia in the early evening as part of planned gameplay update for all trainers globally we released legendary pokémon Articuno and lugia to spawn in the border area around downtown Chicago and around the world that's when Pokemon go trainers did something awesome as people filed out of the event into the surrounding areas where cellular network was less overburdened they were able to play together and capture legendary Pokemon in the wild it was inspiring to watch trainers band together with their friends to enjoy the beautiful the beautiful evening together despite the struggles of the day that spirit extended well into the night and resumed again the next day with clusters of Pokemon trainers roaming the city battling legendary Pokemon throughout the day on Sunday together from late Saturday to Sunday trainers in downtown Chicago participated in more than 69,000 raid battles and captured more than 7.7 million Pokemon including more than 440,000 legendary Pokemon it was an amazing sight to behold and it is a testament to the love of the game and the bonds these trainers share with each other trainers from the world joined around as well during the same time period they participated in more than 4.6 million raid battles and caught more than 500 million pokemon including more than one point nine million legendary Pokemon at the same time we were struggling in Chicago an amazing event was unfolding in Chester UK organized by a partner big heritage more than 17,000 people visited that event over two days in one of England's oldest and most historic settings the combination of history and family orientated Pokemon go play was a hit we will be incorporating all our learnings into Pokemon go events planned for later the summer in Yokohama Japan and across Europe as these events unfold trainers a lot around the world will have a chance to capture even more legendary Pokemon based on the efforts Saturday at Pokemon go-fast lugia loot lugia lugia and Articuno were unlocked in the weeks ahead they will be joined by Moltres and Zapdos Articuno will be will be available from January 22nd to July 31st Moltres July 31st to August 7th and Zapdos on August 7th through August 14th finally last paragraph here real-world events are the core to the Niantic mission of exploration exercise and social interaction we've been doing this since the early days of ingress in 2012 those events group progressively larger over time starting with a few dozen in attendance growing to over 10,000 in Tokyo last summer and each stage of growth we've encountered challenges and each time we've overcame them we gained new skills and pioneered new techniques for building real world experiences that support our mission last Saturday was not a happy day for us but we are committed to listening to that feedback however harsh to improve that we can continue to build experiences and bring people together technology in the real world in innovative ways John Hanke so incredibly well written I think incredibly well said I think needed to be but will where your thoughts overall from this message from the antic I mean he's still expressing optimism and the fact that they're still committed to providing this game you know they're not throwing in the towel because everybody because it didn't work on that one Saturday they're actually planning you know I'm continuing having events and hopefully that those future events will be successful so yeah I mean I think it's it is well-written I think it's a good explanation but obviously you know when he says they invite whatever criticism ever harsh they're gonna get it and because trolls patrols and yeah I mean there's other news items I'm sure that are going to address that portion of it I don't know last week how much time he spent on it once the legendary so the legend the lugia was supposed to start at 6 p.m. and then the surprise was our takuna because team mystic one was also supposed to appear and that whole mystery event was from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. and then the the fest was over at 7:05 p.m. that's when the first legendary raid showed up which was lujah which was above the fountain near grant near Grant Park not in Grant Park what was said here in the blog post which I feel like if you're reading a Pokemon go article on on polygon or the verge or CNN or I know who everyone reported on this so whether wherever you're reading this article you're seeing Pokemon go fest in a negative light and for fair reasons with that whole weekend starting at 7:00 p.m. going into Sunday was just incredible and we'll you were there Saturday night but even like before we got to dinner even after dinner we played a ton of Pokemon go fest any Pokemon go and it was really good and really fun yeah you kept me there Saturday night that is true it was a good time like you call it fun I mean I gotta get before anybody else yeah before you got to the you walked in with a lujah and what like to Articuno her - no i walked in with two loogie as i still don't have an idea - Articuno zand swagger all the all the unknowns Irina and I went back to Chicago after we record so we recorded that podcast on Sunday morning we were we were recording for like three hours and we ended up with a two-hour episode and then we went to will myself I read mica we went to lunch got some good thin crust pizza oh oh I mean it was tasty but saying that it's good is really a put-down to other kinds of pizza in the world we then stopped at Mayfair Mall to see if there were raids there's an article and lugia there we learned firsthand how uncooperative Milwaukee people are when it comes to raids correct we quickly left that and then Myka took will to the airport Irene and I went back to Chicago so that's a it was about an hour and fifteen minute drive for me and because we went down during rush hour we parked and it was Sunday rush hour every day every hour of Chicago is rush hour and we did Pokemon go again we walked up to the giant Maleny millennium beam and there was a lugia there like right when we got out of the car we caught that we walked down the street there was another ray we caught that we walked over to the amphitheater there was a Charizard there were people doing that we caught that we were there from about 6 p.m. to about midnight so six hours and it was just incredible I can't even put into words how much fun I had you people could say well Pokemon go fast was a bust but that's Sunday would have never happened if Pokemon go Fest was successful because one of the things they change on the fly and again props Niantic for doing this is not only did they extend the event out to miles around Chicago they extended it to Monday night so Sunday would have never really without the failure of the event and Sunday was easily one of the best days of Pokemon Goa that I've added that I've ever had playing the game alright and now we fade in every rose has its thorn yes yeah I agree I wish I could have stayed until Monday because I would have gone back down to Chicago with you guys I I I think we said this last week I assume at one point because they the anti kind of threw in the towel around 4:30 legendary raids went up at about 7:00 7:05 I am sure like halfway through the day they were like we need to get legendary raids working as soon as possible and it's possible that while yeah we are going to miss our 6 o'clock deadline we can probably get it tonight that was the right call we know all these Chicago people are still going to be in town whether they came I'm sure I'm sure some people throughout that night but for the people who didn't which my guess would be most of the people they were still in Chicago and then they they were primed to experience the legendary raids like what like what was talked about here in the blog post and the final thing I want to say on this before we move to our next article is even with all this bad press and Pokemon go fest being a flop at least during baby during the time that it was scheduled Pokemon go the app in iOS made it to number one in the App Store and as of we're recording this it's number two so that's a whole week after the fest has been over like it seems like this is gonna be talked about for a while but it doesn't seem like this is going to put a dent in that core fan base no I agree I've actually been playing Pokemon go a tremendous amount more ever since that Saturday and I've been catching all kinds of Pokemon yeah I agree to some extent I think a lot of the fan base will be angry for a while but I you know you go to the root of their anger it's because they were really excited to have a cool event with the game they like it's like it it probably will still like the game they'll just probably be a little angry about it for a while this probably won't be talked about that much and you know four or five months but the next time the antic does an event I think the only difference there is the people that did go might second-guess buying a ticket but overall I don't think that matters because there were plenty of people that didn't get tickets that would probably buy those tickets as quickly as they can the next time they do this speaking of the next time they do this they're planning on it in Europe but they have delayed some of the European events this is off the verge calm the antique lab through a big event in Chicago last weekend to celebrate the first year of Pokemon go only to run into cellular data congestion and server issues that made the game unplayable for many attendees now the company has announced that it is delaying several of the planned European events to ensure trainers will be able to play the game in a blog post Natick said that two of the events planned for Copenhagen and Prague on August 5th and Stockholm and Amsterdam on August 12th will be delayed until later this fall several of the other planned events for Japan August 14th and France Spain and Germany September 16th are moving forward as scheduled the delay comes after Chicago's Pokemon go Fest got off to a disastrous start last week cellular service was spotty the server issues prevented players from logging into the game when the antic CEO John Hanke took sage for his opening remarks players booed him and the company ultimately ended up offering refunds and $100 worth of pokey coins to players last week nearly two dozen attendees launched a class action lawsuit against Niantic aiming to recoup travel expenses to make up for the delay of its European events the antics said that players in certain European cities should keep their eyes out for Pokemon that are rarely seen in Europe Ghengis case can and promised further updates once the new dates were locked down not terribly big news with the delays I think that's I think that's fine instead of the event ending on September 16th in France Spain and Germany that's when the event is going to be kicking off other events later this fall I think that's let's talk about this two dozen attendees launching a class-action lawsuit I'm sir I'm sure all 24 are from California because they are a lawsuit happy in that state well but just to make it clear that once it becomes if they are granted a class-action lawsuit that means that all attendees of the mango Fest become the class so it's not limited to just those 24 people I'm no longer a class because I bet when I applied for that refund it probably said you can't sue us now you can't you can't give away your legal rights you can't sign away leak certain legal rights so ya know you you're a member of the class you actually I don't want to be a part of the class just like I didn't want to be part of my high school graduate class you you you will be given an the option to remove yourself from the class right like you have probably seen things that come to you in the mail that say like are our records show that you know it like a lot of the times it happens with like vehicles like our records show that you're an owner of a whatever a year Ford or Chevy or whatever whatever and there's a class-action lawsuit so if you want to opt out reply with yada yada so it'll probably be away for if you don't want to be involved there will probably be a specific way for you to opt out of the class do you guys think that a lawsuit is needed for the people who are complaining about travel expenses that's a leading question do you think it's not do you think these complainers are acting in a necessary fashion yeah I think the more more or less the question so Travis not being at the event I think your opinion is very valuable but let's say you drove you you would've drove farther than I would that's for sure I think your drive would have been five hours to Chicago yeah no like two two and a half two and a half okay so let's say let's just say you drove three hours there you didn't want to drive the three hours back so you get a you know you get a hotel room for one night you drive three hours back that's not terribly expensive after the disaster that was the day Yantic is giving you $100 in your game which is I personally was very happy with that and they're refunding your ticket so you're the refunding you $30 well I just do you think that what do you think that was good enough for the people who attended and we're not gonna we're not talking about travel expenses yet we're just talking about those two things I'm having difficulty understanding what question you asked are you asking if you're asking do I think the refund plus the pokey coin credit was suitable from like a like an ethical standpoint like like if you're asking do I think that that was substantial enough to be an example of Niantic doing the right thing if that's your question I think I say yes if you're asking is that enough to make a lawsuit unnecessary my answer would be I don't think those two things are very related at all I mean like I think on the question of a lawsuit I wouldn't know where to start because to me it a lawsuit seems kind of outrageous in this instance like e to sue someone because I paid to go see a thing and then like like I wouldn't go to like the only thing I can think of to compare it that like would be a thing I would go to is like if I went to see a band like play a concert and I thought their set was terrible like I wouldn't sue them like that seems outrageous and to me it I don't really see it as being that much different like it Pokemon go promised an event at Niantic promised an event and it didn't go well but like that's to me that just always that's that's always an option in the back of you know that's always a possibility so I a lawsuit seems strange to me and I don't necessarily think the absence or presence of a refund afterwards really would really effects whether a lawsuit is necessary does that make sense yes no you you answered it exactly how I wanted it you too and I worded that poorly and you still understood it so it just shows the the dedication you have four years of - really good will your thoughts on this lawsuit and if it was if you deem it necessary um so you know I'm not a lawyer but just trying to break it apart in a somewhat legalistic point of view the question is like did not occur until to spend extra amounts of money on airfare and hotel to come to Chicago and you know and then there therefore they are liable for those expenses because if they hadn't have put on their event then people wouldn't have spent the money right and then so they're therefore they have harmed the people that spent the money I just I don't see that as carrying through coherently because you know let's imagine that like some really great band that doesn't play a lot of shows like my favorite band Fall Chen we're gonna do a concert in Central Park in New York right and they're like we're doing one concert it's the first time we've done the concert in a decade and we're not going to do another concert for another decade and this is the one right if people bought plane tickets and hotels in New York City to go see that concert and then fall Cham was like oh we just all got measles so concerts cancelled and we're not rescheduling and you know we'll refund all your tickets there's no lawsuit no one would have a lawsuit saying well we're suing them because we paid all this money so it's really falls into that same category and I'm actually surprised that there are well I want to say that I'm surprised that there are lawyers that took this case thinking that they could actually win but I guess there's lawyers that'll take any case out there wait what you both said I think are good analogies what I was thinking is like my trip I'm going to pax West to talk about Pokemon like I do I just booked Irene and my plane ticket for that and it was $1,100 the hotel I booked was $1,200 so we're at a $2,000 travel expense to go to Seattle for four days and my wallet hurts a lot from that and I'm I am confident that there are there were plenty of people that traveled outside of Chicago that probably paid more than $2,000 to get to Chicago to get a hotel to get ready for Pokemon go fest but who maybe I have the answer the who is the people suing who goes to a new city or just a city for one event and nothing else like when I when I'm going to go to Seattle I'm going to go to the Space Needle I'm going to go to a museum I'm going to walk it down I'm gonna walk around the wharf is that what it's called the wharf I never been to Seattle but rocks this distorter the boat area I'm gonna walk around the boat area I'm gonna do a hundred things because I'm in a new city I'm on a vacation just because the event I went to didn't work a hundred percent it did work some percent and it continued and it worked really well if you walked two blocks away from the event which they extended at what did they extend it will at like 3 p.m. they extended it to get out at that time where they said hey leave the park go catch unknown go catch heracross go get your two kegs one block away just go out and play outside the park it'll work we made it work outside the park and you know what it'll work the rest of the night and I'll work the next day and it will work Monday everything that you can experience here now works just leave the park but going back to my original statement who goes to an event just for one thing like I cannot imagine the people that are suing that flew to Chicago didn't do other stuff in the city there's so much to do in Chicago I don't know that's debatable I mean it is Chicago what are you gonna do you're gonna eat you can irrigate your Chicago you're gonna have a hot dog you see what I'm saying though yeah of course $2,000 is very nice where IAM is very cool I'll I don't agree with the planetarium that was very disappointing now the Chicago the Chicago science and magic those two words don't go together the science of magic industry yeah that museums legit that that is a very good museum I could never imagine going to anis a city for a Pokemon event only doing that Pokemon event and then not doing anything else I mean I'm on the side of the fence where I don't agree with this lawsuit I hope these people Oh honestly it has no legal merit I mean if you just look at any kind of historical precedent there if just legaly large there's no but just look at any large concert that ever got canceled and see if people ever got there travel and hotel paid for and going back to PACs like bungee is going to have their own area at PAX West this year and I'm very excited for that and I booked my tickets before they announced that they were gonna have before they announced that destiny too was going to be there before they announced that they were gonna have their own area if I get there and Bungie goes up well you know that building burned down to a week ago and we don't have a spot to host our event you know what I do instead because most of my most of my time there at PAX will probably be in that Bungie area because I love I love destiny if for some reason that doesn't exist when I get there I'm not gonna say hey I want my two thousand dollars back because I paid to go to pax west and this specific thing at pax west didn't work slash wasn't there slash you know what I do I do other stuff and in the case of Pokemon go yeah it didn't work for most of the day but they made it work in a different situation you just had to listen to what they had to say which was leave our Park and go play elsewhere and it will work we made it work don't worry guys it works and it did work it's it's frustrating what will will will keep covering it as it goes on travel is expensive but no one's no one's forcing you to do it one more bit of news but what we'll do is we'll take a break we got some rumors regarding Ultra Sun and ultramoon probably fake like I said before but we'll talk about it right when we get back from our break which we're taking right now and we are back from our break let's talk about this ultra Sun ultramoon fake rumors wow this is a 4chan by the way so you know oh wow it's the latest very finest of information all right so according to this rumor the second trailer for Ultra Sun and ultra moon is supposed to come on August 6 the trailer will start off showing some major character changes Lilly is your rival glady on will take care of nebby and how will be the first trial captain using psychic type of Pokemon already I'm not buying this but psychic type for how that's not just my despit they will then reveal new forms of familiar a lowland Pokemon there will be a mimic you horror form after the disguise activates on certain mimic you their sheets will fall off and show a dark creature with a round head no 8 piercing red eyes and eight of its claws and eight of its claws holding it up along with a drooling matte mouth no and this is wrong right here because we've already seen what mimic you looks like out of its disguise in the Pokemon anime where it's like a floating like an orb all of ya floating or gaseous orb when it undergoes this change it will become ghost / dark and its opponent lardo flinches the turn it is revealed it is much faster and stronger and has higher Special Attack than physical now though its physical attack is still higher than normal mimic you and it's abysmal defend but it will have a Bismil defense and special defense so there's your mimic you change yeah I also agree with Travis even in the anime it shows that it has two eyes underneath its cloak when it's in the water swimming yep yep okay so to bury this room or even more it the trailer will then show aces Azal gangster form it will always be male and it can only it can only become male by leveling up and knowing the move thief I think you've said something wrong there because you said it can only become male you mean it can only only go else can become gangster form yes I'm sorry correct this is the worst thing I've ever heard it's a bill of its ability is prankster and it's poison / dark types slightly higher attack through its attack stat and it's barely uh which is barely unusable higher speed higher a slightly higher defense much lower special attack and special defense it has a mask on like sandal sandal the sandal it sandlot soul and it yep with a cape the cape with no tail it even has more of a slim body next it will show some brand new all Olin forms a lowland qwilfish will be shown with a steel poison tight typing has a new ability iron gar guard which is immune to all statuses including minor statuses like confusion and infatuation it almost always goes last even with a priority move and the opponent using a - priority move that doesn't make any sense and destroys the writer even more it is more like that unless the a theoretical new ability also included that which is it's more metallic looking darker green parts are silver having longer shaped quills also has a ball and chain at matched a lowland snubbull and grand bull ground for snubbull ground fighting for grand bull ability is imitate on stub snubbull knock back for Grandville contact moves have a 20% chance to switch the Pokemon out their color scheme is out of an actual bulldog more muscular both stand on all four more coming below a lowland slugma is ice ability ability is freezing pressure makes water type moves used on it sent back at 1.5 power of an ice type move however fire type moves even the ones that don't do it have a hundred percent chance of burn when you use on slugma woo these abilities are real complicated for a rumor yeah and the fact that all of them almost and all of them are like unique abilities with the exception of prankster which is a huge like fan favorite ability like hmm it's almost like this is just uh these are just some ones you know fantasies about what a cool Pokemon would be a final thing shown in the trailer is a twist is what the twisting cling was shown in trailer one is it's a Z it's called a Z ability one Pokemon per battle has its ability buff overgrown blaze or and torment for example I'll do the same thing with full HP their stats besides HP are basically half of what they're supposed to do but the more damage the Pokemon takes the more powerful the move gets at 1/8 HP or lower their base stats are doubled only Pokemon with exclusive Z crystals can have AZ ability and acts as a Z move in single battle its Z move or Z ability one or another first comment is sounds plausible [Laughter] does it the problem I have with this rumor is how complicated the abilities are like the whole yeah hey you're you're if you're a lowland Slugma you're getting burned by any fire type move even if the fire type move doesn't burn you what ability has ever been that complicated arguably the most complicated ability or maybe it just seems the most complicated because it's new and complicated but arguably the most complicated ability is water bubble which is the ability that arachnid I recommend yeah yeah has because it has like multiple effects so first it cuts the damage from fire type moves in half and it but it also doubles the power of water type moves you use but it also also prevents you from being burned and like there's all these stipulate and like that is such an exception to the rule and like every and and stands out for how strange it is and how many effects it has like as I was listening them I had already forgotten some of the earlier effects that I had already said and pretty much all of the abilities that were listed there are like on that level of complication and like water bubble already stands out so much of being strange and overly complicated I really doubt that they're like let's just have a bunch of those also soul as a mean dude now even though even going back to the first sentence lily is your rival glady and will take care of Nabi I have zero zero clue how that works on a story in a story sentence and how was the first trial captain I think we were all in agreement that this was more like a platinum or an emerald than a black and white - correct and what they're laying out seems more like a black and white - of yeah the whole mimic you thing I don't think it's plausible at all it's not like the animes things and it's got blood and it's got death and it's really not all I could see mimic you having its own form I could totally see that I also understand the basic concept of if you're going to have a Pokemon hiding under a disguise you probably never actually show what's under there because that's just like a trope that you use to get people interested in it this that make sense like why it's like in Harry Potter you never see the true form of the bog art or whatever that you never see that and that's the point and I feel like that's the point of mimic you you don't know what's under to the disguise and once you know it defined of deflates the importance of that Pokemon once you know yep I I could see a male like a gangster form obviously isn't what it would actually be called I could totally see a male selasa but I think that takes away the specialness of finding a female so Zazzle sandal it sandal sandal sandal the same a lot soul and it yeah yeah the quill like via lowland qwilfish sounds plausible except for the ridiculous ability that yeah like if your ability of quote-unquote Iron Guard which I think they said that it's not an Iron Guard sounds like an ability that exists but apparently they're saying it's a new ability but that's that's fine for an ability to go hey we're you're immune to every single status condition including confusion and infatuation which okay that's fine cool but also if you use quick attack and they use protect wait now protect his highest priority what's a move that example yeah or as a counter counter goes second right count-o toner is a good example but well may be a bad example but pursuit pursuit yeah pursued always go second doesn't it we're very we're Pokemon experts here anyways qwilfish has Aquajet which I'm pretty sure a normal cool fish can learn which is prior to +1 well fish uses Aquajet and they use just a base zero move and they're slower so let's say there what's this what's a slow pokemon snorlax I think qwilfish is faster than Snorlax to tell me that the ability also makes them go last using a plus one priority that that doesn't make any sense - priority so the lowest priority move in generation seven at least in this chart that I'm looking at right here is trick room okay trick room would go before a Aquajet yeah that doesn't seem right or something I don't know hmm and then the real question is how does any of that work once trick room goes up I don't want to think about it yeah and I would even I would even go to the extent of saying none of this sounds that great like a low one qwilfish cool I could I could buy into that cuz qwilfish is a pretty okay Pokemon everything listed just sounds a little too edgy you know okay there aren't there aren't any little cute pokémon in this description true where's the toga Don Mario yeah I don't know I also like if they're showing all Lolan forms for Generation - I don't think slugma and qwilfish are your staple Pokemon show feel like you have other who remembers gentie Pokemon yeah they're go phyllo swine hi love yeah I'll miss it that has a later evolution so that's not as cool as it mammoth I like Mamoswine a lot Mamoswine is fine but it's too big for pokey hugs I already went over this okay I understand let's do some evals first email we have if you have any questions comments or concerns you can send us emails over at SB j at pkmn cast comm or go over to pokemon podcast comm hit that contact button first email here is from Stefan says that in the first sentence hi my name is Stefan pronounced Stef Finn I was thinking about this after listening to broke man no fast podcast again sorry to hear that will didn't get any golden birthday booty just one question how did you all meet I've been listening to the podcast for over a year now I love it I haven't thought about it into listening to you all in the same room with each other Stefan I definitely sent in well a is it I was a big fan of the show for I listened in the show's early days and I was a huge fan of it to the extent where when I was in high school I would be sitting in class that I always it was there wasn't enough work to do in that class and it was a computer class so I ended up just sitting on the Pokemon podcast on the it's super effective website and refreshing waiting for new articles to appear because that's when there was a lot of written content on the website and I'll just sit there like come on I need I need some content right now I'm sitting you're bored in class and so and so in that those days I did write I wrote in occasionally as you are listener Stefan and then later around episode like well so episode 31 was my first but so a little bit before that I think you tweeted out something along the lines of would anyone be interested in being on the show or something and I already had some experience podcasting because a predecessor of one of my shows now a predecessor to the arbitrary archive that show I was already doing at that point when I was still in high school with my brother so I already had a microphone I knew how it went so I said hey I know things about Pokemon and I really liked your show so I can do it and then he said okay and me and Kenny hopped in a Skype call and we recorded episode 31 revamp that is accurate will I don't remember the initial conversation but I remember I was in a I was living in a house at the time I was sharing a house with two other people I already met Irene at this point and we talked a little bit I'm pretty sure it was over email and then I found out you worked at Georgetown and you wanted to do content for the site and you had a degree in African Studies if I recall well I mean that's part of it sure I remember all that at once and then being very excited and going to work about just like meeting you but I don't remember why you initially emailed in or was like hey I'm reaching up to you oh I remember our very first very very first interaction of all interactions you tweeted something from the show account about the number of hours you had put into Pokemon black and white and I responded and said don't worry it caps out after 999 because I had already hit that number oh man that it stops counting once you get to 9-under didn't I did not now I put a lot of time in the black/white no I think I can't remember why but Dave Thomas was like not doing Pokemon of the week articles anymore so and you were like revamping the site and you were like oh I need people to provide content for the site and I was like well I got nothing better to do with my life let me see if I can write articles and then you're like well give me a sample article and then I did and then you're like well that sounds good you can write Pokemon of the week and then I started writing Pokemon of the week February 14th 2012 I think yeah it was really 2012 what oh yeah that what that's right because yeah that sounds right my first article was Totodile not terribly exciting stories but stories nonetheless this message is from Scott hey SBJ and squad no favorites here you are all great this is Scott from Phoenix Arizona at Scott and slack I've been listening since the black and white days I haven't sent in an email to the show for awhile and I have a question that's been on my mind since Sun and Moon launched are you planning on doing Ana Lola top 10 ranking like you did for Kalos I love the Kalos top 10 and I would really enjoy getting your opinions on the top oh Lola Pokemon now with the games now that the games have been out for a while I was also a big fan of the Kickstarter episode and I thought it would be even better if you could all record the list creation just a thought thanks for all you do Scott so this is just a person who likes ranking things hmm love the rank I remember talking about did we we talked about the Kayla or not the Kayla see a lowland Pokemon when we did the Kickstarter episode and the consensus at that time was you all really wanted mimic you know I think the consensus was that like not all of them had even been announced at that point right yeah was it or the games came out I remember a lot of you wanted to put mimic you on the list and I finally said hey we're not going yeah with this remember it being that way I don't remember being that way at all I think it was just like mimic you had just been announced and me and Mike I thought mimic you was funny and like would jokingly said if a lowland Pokemon were allowed it would just be all mimic you all town okay as a joke because I don't think all of the yellow and Pokemon had even that announced yet I think you're right but we was like no let's let's not worry about a Lola and we did the list as it was and now I think we're so close to ultra sentient ultramoon it would be a shame if we did it now and then all of a sudden they show you know a Lowen Ursaring and we would have to adjust the list accordingly so I think it's something we would do but probably after ultra Sun and ultra moon and I think that's okay because it's still like the same generation I think that works give me and give me a quick quick take named three Pokemon you that you'd consider for that list robot and I'll probably have the same exact ones ya rabbim be right out of thank you mmm it's hard to narrow down a third like dual Lolan forms count yeah that's the other question if they do then probably I think maybe like a lowland exeggutor I'm a huge Rabanne B fan that just by very good it's it's just a very special little guy that that you got to have it also can like kill dragons so I mean they make use an easy call because that is such a really cool although I'm using mimic you in my Pokemon Sun playthrough right now so basically I hatched it from an egg and it's not that strong in the lower levels it's really useful it it is useful to have in a single-player playthrough though because once you have leveled it up to an extent where your higher level than all of the wild Pokemon it's really nice to be able to have a Pokemon that can take a hit and no HP is lost because you just always yell with it in the front and it's disguised as dead but you up but you can pretty much guarantee two hits and then you'd like never lose HP and you don't lose that sort of war of attrition that is walking through a route to the next pokey Center yeah the really hard thing is though it doesn't learn play rough until level 46 oof so that's the long wait before you get that really strong fairy-type move well though it's cute um my third mm I don't know but it's a tough call I mean there's so many that I like I love all the Pokemon I mean Iraq wa need is the one that was my like workhorse for most of my Pokemon moon playthrough so I have to go with that I would probably go with two cannon Lytton and a low infernal cat Inferno cat those are terrible picks oh man - Kaelyn city garbage Pokemon what is the third one what did you see oh oh oh and muck I like a little and muck a lot it's it's it's my little pride flag Pokemon it on it will do will do one more email for this episode this one is from AC Boston hey everyone big shout out to mcbird Burgess dye say that right Burgas Burgess urges Burgess for all the awesome music that he's been making for the show the bumps are now one of the elements I look forward to most each week on new is see an episode 273 Steve tackled the issue of how although we've gotten mega evolutions in regional variants we haven't seen many straightforward evolutions of classic so now Jen 1 - Jen for I guess Pokemon that we did with Jen 2 and Jen for a long time ago that got me thinking what if assuming that Pokemon continues to introduce regional variants and pre-existing species they introduced new regional form of an old Pokemon and give it that regional form its own unique evolution although sand the sands slot / is the end of the line when it comes to Sandshrew traditional evolution what if a lowland sand / could evolve further into a stage - Pokemon we've never seen before because can Tony insane / cannot evolve any further but a lowland sand / can this could give some stage 1 pokémon without mega evolutions an extra buff such as dong Don fan Ursaring or mark cargo pants it's a weird thought and I don't know how I feel about it so I figured I'd run it by you keep up the good work AC where do I put this garbage in my pokedex yeah what what what pokedex number does it get you you the math does not work yeah the Pokedex number would be a little weird although I mean it's already toured with haunch crow and like politoed and stuff fine the math does work I mean I like the idea thick they can do whatever they want and it is it is a nice idea where they can sort of just expand on our currently enjoyed pokemons well except that the problem is that they haven't revealed them yet right and I don't want them one of the biggest mice biggest criticisms of black - white - was it's like oh it's five years later and wow we've had this huge surge of foreign pokemons all over you Nova now that we didn't have five years ago and I'm like oh this is the lifecycle of Pokemon really five years that they could have this many up here from out of nowhere a cargo plane just flew overhead and open attached and you know dropped a bunch of Chimchar s and stuff that's not warrant any chairs laid on 0.5 yeah the story the cargo gained but you know yeah that's so that's my what a my concerns with Ultra Sun and ultra moon and introducing new Pokemon that just they weren't there but they just happen to be there now that that would I would not enjoy that I would that would take away from the games for me so but even if they didn't do this an ultra son an ultra moon but they did in a future game it would still be interesting I suppose I my guess is they wouldn't do it just because I doubt they would want to introduce two versions of the same evolutionary line where one is strictly better than the other and I don't think they would be willing to put in the design effort to craft an evolution in the theoretical version of the evolutionary line that has an additional stage I doubt they would want to put in all the design effort to make it not seem strictly better than the evolutionary line that doesn't get the evolution is what I'm saying does that make sense yeah so just for your clarification purposes maybe this is a dumb question and I am pretty confident I know the answer but I'm just gonna ask it anyways you can only get a lowland Rattata in sun and moon right correct and what if I take a regular read attack from X&Y move it to Pokemon bank and then move it to Sun and Moon it stays as a regular read attack correct if you breed it however that was my next question it will be born as in a lowland form okay but what if I breed - Rattata from X&Y is it then a lowland because you're in Sun and Moon yes to my knowledge I can look it up and confirm but that was my understanding so a regular muck and a ditto e'en Sun and Moon will produce an Aloha and Grimer even though it shouldn't I don't know I feel like it shouldn't if I mean influence of the islands so okay but it's but mom amok has no rainbow going through her okay genetics has no application to the Pokemon world even if they did try to imply that through Pokemon X&Y eggs appear by magic na psychology well not with that attitude no comment I guess my other question and we probably don't know the answer is I can have a lowland rata and regular rata sit and Pokemon bank together and the assumption would be whenever a new game comes out that isn't a low and related so let's say you know gen 8 is on Australia and I move a low and riot at and a lowland a lowland rats head regular riot at into a daycare I would assume that maybe if the mom is a lowland it produced well that doesn't make sense because going with your original statement if it's the region that is generating these riots hats it'll be dark then on a different Island they would just become normal again even though one might be a lowland and one wouldn't be alone one of the appearance has to hold a lowland in sense and then it has an a lowland child that's not that's not a real thing now it's not I was so in that as you're asking that question I was looking up to see if my previous answer was correct and it was to a point to a back pad a little but the question was due to Kanto form Pokemon so like - Kanto form Rattata if they breed do they form a lowland or Kanto form Ratatat if bred in sun and moon and the answer is that they will for manilow 'ln Ratatat unless they are given a verse tones to hold at which point they will breed a Kanto Revathy okay they both have to have ever stones the only example I could find on the internet was was with a Ditto so I'm not sure it might be just the mother or just the father I would imagine just the mother interesting that's good to know it's a good question - from AC well I think that'll wrap up emails if you have any emails and if if you set them first off if you sent an email I haven't gotten to it don't worry I there flagged to read if it's been it's been more like a month and I haven't gotten to it maybe Ari email but anyways if you want to send in any emails SP j at pkmn cast calm or pokemon podcast calm and hit that contact button and send us your emails we love reading them let's do our pokemon of the week so we switched it up the week before because Travis is here what it's going to be is will is going to start off Pokemon of the week with the violet what's it called biology biology yep and then Travis will give us a move set for that and then I'll do a quick Pokemon go move set and then we'll do trivia and then we'll wrap it up so that's the first time we're trying it with Travis because they were not here when we originally switched this UPS right take it away will did we say our Pokemon the week was Kabutops did I say that no no and you're supposed to say it at the beginning of the program oh yeah where's little kid went to sleep and net we'll never know hopefully the week was hopefully he read the notes with a body closely resembling a living skeleton Kabutops has a Halfmoon disc shaped head with two small forward-facing eyes its body has a light gray chest plate with a brown shell resembling a visible backbone containing three ribs per turning on each side and a thick pointed tail it does not have hands but large sharp gray size its legs are brown and thin leading into small feet with two large grey claws Kabutops can tuck in its shell to help it swim extremely fast in its ocean home where it can catch prey it uses its sharp size to cut enemies and drink their internal fluids before it went extinct it was in the process of evolving into a land dweller in order to catch prey that had already evolved into land dwelling species as seen in the anime Kabutops greatly prefer to live in seclusion and will become very hostile when provoked well we get to see some of that hostility on the Pokemon battlefield and for that the submission from Kevin a frequent Pokemon week contributor in the Pokemon of the week slack channel because Kabutops has access to a very strong ability in Swift swim this is going to be a move set designed to be paired with something that said that sets up rain most likely pelipper which I believe is a book about of the week maybe a month ago so pelipper will set up rain with the ability drizzle and then Kabutops will be paired with it because the Swift swim ability I mentioned earlier doubles the speed of a given Pokemon when under the effects of rain which is very handy to be able to go first more often so it's going to be Kabutops with a life orb to maximize the amount of damage output we're having given that Swift swim gears you towards a very often so set with adamant nature to maximize the amount of damage you're outputting and then 250 two V's in attack speed and then four and HP your moves are going to be waterfall and stone edge for same type attack bonus also waterfall is going to be boosted in their reign anyway so that's going to hit very hard stone edge because that's the secondary ability of Kabutops Swords Dance if you is in there because it you're already dealing a lot of damage but sometimes if you're up against something like maybe a cèlle Stila that's been that's been granted a boost to its defenses from like ultra boost is that what that ability is called you can I think it's a beast boost beast boost there we go you can increase your attack by two stages to be able to break through walls like that and then the last move Kevin recommends either Aquajet for priority super power for more coverage or protect because protect is always quite good if you want to take that move set to the real world battlefield my transition was not as good as Jeff's system yeah each ride in Pokemon go the best move set you can have 4 good boo tops is fury cutter and stone edge now one of the reasons I picked Kabutops was because we are getting Moltres next as our legendary Pokemon in the wild while Kabutops isn't the best choice for Maul trees it is still a pretty good Pokemon to use because of the rock and water typing the unfortunate thing here is while fury cutter is one of the better fast type attacks for Kabutops rock smash is also decent but you're not you're not getting a stab on any of these mud shot is your third best move so the fast moves are either fury cutter rock smash or mud shot fury cutter being the best mud shot being the worst because none of the none of those get stabbed which is unfortunate and if you're unfamiliar of what stab is it's the same type attacked bonus so for googoo tops it would be any rock type moves and water-type moves and those three fast attacks i've read off neither our rock or water stone edge is going to be your best charge tight move which would do which should work mult Reese pretty well water pulse is going to be the second best move again going to do some hard work on multis ancient power is going to be the worst charge type move but again in this situation still pretty good form all trees Kabutops is not as good as probably what would be omastar to use again small trees which is best move set is rock throwed and hydro pump both are stab type moves both are super effective against small trees but again if you're going in battle against this legendary Pokemon you're going to have the resistance against love the flying-type that mouthpiece is doing and you're going to have the resistance against the fire type so personally Kabutops not a terrible choice for this week's legendary Pokemon if if you happen to find a mole trees and more importantly if you happen to find a group to do both there a mole trees with in battle I've got a lot of response that people like to the Pokemon go move set so there you go if you enjoyed both the Travis move set for Sun and Moon and the Pokemon goes like heaven move said please let us know via Twitter or slack or whatever some trivia real quick in Pokemon Red and Blue
