foreign (0:01 - 0:04)
what's up everyone welcome to the 535th (0:22 - 0:27)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:25 - 0:30)
super effective I'm your host Steve with (0:27 - 0:34)
me is Greg hello I have purchased new (0:30 - 0:37)
clothing out of necessity and (0:34 - 0:40)
I am here to State vanity sizing is the (0:37 - 0:42)
worst thing that's ever happened to (0:40 - 0:44)
buying clothing I was gonna ask if you (0:42 - 0:48)
went back to fjallraven and got the that (0:44 - 0:49)
nice (0:48 - 0:51)
um no (0:49 - 0:55)
it was the uh jacket slash card hoodie (0:51 - 0:57)
without a hood which is my favorite type (0:55 - 0:59)
of Hoodie sweatshirty type thing no I (0:57 - 1:01)
used a hoodie without a hood just a (0:59 - 1:05)
cardigan well no I mean so Cardigans (1:01 - 1:06)
usually have buttons and they have a (1:05 - 1:09)
very specific collar so you have zip up (1:06 - 1:11)
jackets you have zip up Cardigans you (1:09 - 1:13)
have zip up sweatshirts uh they also (1:11 - 1:16)
call them Hood list now hoodless hoodies (1:13 - 1:19)
which is a new fashion terminology we're (1:16 - 1:21)
getting away from the point the vanity (1:19 - 1:23)
sizing is terrible I'm mad at it because (1:21 - 1:26)
I no longer can order online and know if (1:23 - 1:29)
I'm getting my size by size is currently (1:26 - 1:32)
in question depending on who I'm asking (1:29 - 1:36)
according to their size charts but I (1:32 - 1:38)
will say and you all saw this yesterday (1:36 - 1:42)
that the Pokemon centers (1:38 - 1:44)
size chart for jackets is fairly (1:42 - 1:47)
accurate because the jacket did fit me (1:44 - 1:49)
and I look good in it I believe that (1:47 - 1:53)
vanity sizing for men just like started (1:49 - 1:56)
in probably like 1998. yeah so we were (1:53 - 1:59)
like well on the belief that the actual (1:56 - 2:01)
waist size on a pair of pants was the (1:59 - 2:03)
actual waist size on a pair of pants and (2:01 - 2:05)
then they pulled the rug out from us oh (2:03 - 2:08)
yeah I ordered a pair of 32s from Amazon (2:05 - 2:09)
and I'm like (2:08 - 2:15)

dentist when I saw him last week said (2:43 - 2:51)
this is the best set of teeth I've seen (2:46 - 2:51)
we're not going to the same dentist (2:55 - 3:00)
because I finally got I finally got (2:58 - 3:01)

yeah (3:18 - 3:20)
speaking of sponsoring uh we have an (3:21 - 3:26)
episode uh look uh there we we recorded (3:23 - 3:29)
last week before there was Pokemon news (3:26 - 3:30)
that Pokemon news (3:29 - 3:33)
happened (3:30 - 3:35)
um and then there was more Pokemon news (3:33 - 3:37)
uh so we have a bunch of Pokemon news in (3:35 - 3:40)
regards to scarlet and violet so (3:37 - 3:43)
we're going to talk about that (3:40 - 3:44)
um and then there was a little bit of (3:43 - 3:47)
Pokemon go news and then (3:44 - 3:48)
there's one other article that I can't (3:47 - 3:51)
think of I I was doing really good at (3:48 - 3:53)
keeping show notes up to date and we I (3:51 - 3:54)
missed the show notes this week because (3:53 - 3:57)
I I was in San Diego for twitchcon and (3:54 - 4:00)
then I had to go to New York and then I (3:57 - 4:02)
got back uh and (4:00 - 4:05)
it's it's been a long week I'm very (4:02 - 4:08)
happy to not be traveling (4:05 - 4:08)
here I think left I have one more day (4:09 - 4:15)
trip uh but it's not not business (4:13 - 4:18)
related just just (4:15 - 4:18)
a quick day trip and going up to Duluth (4:19 - 4:23)
like Will Anderson I do I do kind of (4:21 - 4:24)
want to go to Duluth but it's too cold (4:23 - 4:28)
now no it's not what is too cold too (4:24 - 4:32)
cold is like a concept too cold is uh if (4:28 - 4:33)
I have to feel like I need to put my (4:32 - 4:37)
hands in my pockets because of the wind (4:33 - 4:37)
is that I feel like that's a good gauge (4:38 - 4:42)
like if I could just walk outside and (4:40 - 4:44)
hold my phone and be comfortable (4:42 - 4:48)
cool if I hundreds of years (4:44 - 4:51)
Humanity has shared well we're split but (4:48 - 4:54)
the concept of a gauge that is numbers (4:51 - 4:58)
that says above this number is too warm (4:54 - 5:02)
below this number is too cold that I can (4:58 - 5:06)
say for me anything below 25 degrees is (5:02 - 5:10)
probably too cold not where my hands are (5:06 - 5:13)
at that moment (5:10 - 5:13)
foreign (5:13 - 5:15)
yeah I don't know well sometimes like a (5:18 - 5:24)
uh you know like a 50 is is (5:20 - 5:28)
warmer than like as 58 that's like (5:24 - 5:30)
really windy yeah you know what that's (5:28 - 5:31)
called (5:30 - 5:34)
windshield windshield that's why we talk (5:31 - 5:37)
about wind chill here a lot yeah I know (5:34 - 5:38)
it's the whole Midwest thing of like wow (5:37 - 5:40)
it'd be really nice if it wasn't for the (5:38 - 5:43)
wind chill (5:40 - 5:43)
all right always cold so we are not I'll (5:43 - 5:50)
I am not allowed to say that it like (5:47 - 5:52)
I nearly died on the Pumpkin Walk (5:50 - 5:54)
because I would just say it was so cold (5:52 - 5:58)
thank heavens for hand warmers (5:54 - 5:58)
yeah I I would like to take my one wheel (5:58 - 6:02)
out but I I feel like it would be too (6:00 - 6:04)
cold don't take your one wheel to the (6:02 - 6:07)
Pumpkin Walk because you'll plow over a (6:04 - 6:10)
bunch of grandmas (6:07 - 6:10)
that makes it seem like I want to go to (6:10 - 6:14)
the pumpkin work okay uh we got uh (6:12 - 6:16)
scarlet and violet news (6:14 - 6:17)
we're gonna start with that we're gonna (6:16 - 6:20)
start with the good stuff uh and then (6:17 - 6:22)
I don't know complain about Niantic for (6:20 - 6:25)
like 20 minutes uh so (6:22 - 6:27)
I guess we'll we'll go in order here (6:25 - 6:31)
wait where's my okay here we go (6:27 - 6:31)
uh this is off the uh this is the press (6:32 - 6:37)
release that uh the old Pokemon company (6:34 - 6:41)
sent my way uh it says October 6 wow (6:37 - 6:43)
that was 10 days ago (6:41 - 6:47)
uh new games new game features and more (6:43 - 6:49)
Pokemon native to the paldea region were (6:47 - 6:52)
announced today in the new trailer on (6:49 - 6:53)
the official Pokemon YouTube channel (6:52 - 6:55)
Pokemon scarlet and violet the newest (6:53 - 6:57)
editions of to the main series of the (6:55 - 6:59)
Pokemon video games will launch November (6:57 - 7:00)
18th exclusively on the Nintendo switch (6:59 - 7:04)
meet uh hold on I can say this (7:00 - 7:08)
far far far rig graph (7:04 - 7:10)
I think I got there (7:08 - 7:13)
sure regret I'll wait for the official (7:10 - 7:15)
pronunciation on the anime before I (7:13 - 7:17)
commit because I'm not going to be (7:15 - 7:20)
caught up in your fervor of saying names (7:17 - 7:23)
I I think I'm saying it wrong I just the (7:20 - 7:25)
the the putting these letters together (7:23 - 7:27)
and coming out of my mouth was the (7:25 - 7:29)
difficult part I I would pronounce that (7:27 - 7:32)
for a giraffe (7:29 - 7:36)
like giraffe rig for richer yeah did you (7:32 - 7:38)
get a more jit in there (7:36 - 7:43)
with the J sound yes yeah uh as a result (7:38 - 7:45)
of its Evolution the head of its main (7:43 - 7:47)
body and the head of its tail have (7:45 - 7:51)
become one both the photograph's brains (7:47 - 7:52)
are connected through thick nerves (7:51 - 7:55)
increasing its psychic energy and it can (7:52 - 7:57)
emit psychic waves from the antenna on (7:55 - 8:01)
its head for rigarath is always mindful (7:57 - 8:04)
of its surroundings I bet it's a Pokemon (8:01 - 8:07)
go player and it can detect danger in an (8:04 - 8:08)
instant there are times where its body (8:07 - 8:11)
cannot react faster than its two brains (8:08 - 8:12)
can think (8:11 - 8:15)
uh it has the ability chud chew which I (8:12 - 8:18)
think is a cam uh a giraffe (8:15 - 8:21)
giraffeine (8:18 - 8:21)
what is a cud is what oh is that like (8:21 - 8:31)
yeah go for it yeah so you know how uh (8:26 - 8:34)
Kyle has multiple stomachs (8:31 - 8:36)
sure uh that's a misconception it has (8:34 - 8:38)
one stomach that's divided into multiple (8:36 - 8:41)
cells like people not as a multi stomach (8:38 - 8:43)
anyways it eats the grass and whatever (8:41 - 8:46)
and it goes into the first stomach and (8:43 - 8:47)
then while that gets worked on by (8:46 - 8:50)
enzymes it will puke that back up to (8:47 - 8:52)
chew on the cut it made (8:50 - 8:54)
for its next stomach and then it keeps (8:52 - 8:56)
doing that process until it's extracted (8:54 - 8:59)
all of the nutrients out (8:56 - 9:01)
uh that's why cows are known as (8:59 - 9:05)
ruminants yes ruminants but you'll see (9:01 - 9:07)
them seeing out Cody has infected both (9:05 - 9:09)
of you this is too much science for the (9:07 - 9:10)
show (9:09 - 9:13)
I live in a farm State you are you are (9:10 - 9:16)
the person that's like cowser at the zoo (9:13 - 9:18)
because they're so weird and I had to go (9:16 - 9:22)
to a stupid card my entire childhood (9:18 - 9:24)
because the one thing you do you go see (9:22 - 9:26)
the locks which they've shut down and (9:24 - 9:28)
you go see somebody working on a farm (9:26 - 9:30)
and they tell you about cows every day (9:28 - 9:33)
of your life as a child (9:30 - 9:35)
there's a lot of cows in Wisconsin oh (9:33 - 9:37)
there's a lot of cows everywhere cud (9:35 - 9:39)
chew is a new ability appearing for the (9:37 - 9:41)
first time when a Pokemon with cud Chu (9:39 - 9:43)
eats a berry it will eat it one more (9:41 - 9:45)
time at the end of its next turn (9:43 - 9:47)
armor tail is another new ability (9:45 - 9:49)
appearing for the first time it makes (9:47 - 9:51)
the opposing Pokemon unable to use (9:49 - 9:54)
priority moves that's pretty much (9:51 - 9:55)
literally the same it's not a new (9:54 - 9:57)
ability it's just Queensland crazy (9:55 - 10:00)
Spanish but in an in arm reform (9:57 - 10:02)
uh (10:00 - 10:06)
a quick hot take I don't like how they (10:02 - 10:08)
do (10:06 - 10:10)
similar abilities and they just rename (10:08 - 10:13)
them like Zekrom and reshiram's ability (10:10 - 10:15)
is just mold breaker yeah but it (10:13 - 10:16)
wouldn't make (10:15 - 10:18)
it makes for for a giraffe to have (10:16 - 10:22)
Queen's Majesty yeah well okay so just (10:18 - 10:24)
rename Queen's Majesty but then that (10:22 - 10:26)
kind of takes away from the specialness (10:24 - 10:29)
yeah I unders I understand it's just (10:26 - 10:32)
like how many abilities do we have (10:29 - 10:35)
I I don't even know two thousand like if (10:32 - 10:37)
we if we have 300 ability I think we (10:35 - 10:38)
have more than three if we have 300 (10:37 - 10:41)
abilities I feel like a hundred of them (10:38 - 10:43)
are overlapping in some way and they're (10:41 - 10:46)
just differently named (10:43 - 10:46)
uh (10:47 - 10:52)
uh then they showed off picnics (10:49 - 10:55)
players can have a picnic almost (10:52 - 10:59)
anywhere while exploring uh the regions (10:55 - 11:01)
of vast Wilderness along with being able (10:59 - 11:03)
to change the design of the tablecloth (11:01 - 11:06)
cups water bottles and other picnic (11:03 - 11:08)
items to create an arrangement for their (11:06 - 11:11)
liking why when Pokemon eat sandwiches (11:08 - 11:14)
not only will there be their HP be (11:11 - 11:17)
restored but the meal May impart some (11:14 - 11:19)
effects that will come handy on (11:17 - 11:20)
adventures (11:19 - 11:22)
all kinds of sandwiches can be made on a (11:20 - 11:23)
picnic (11:22 - 11:25)
before beginning players can choose what (11:23 - 11:27)
fillings and condiments they would use (11:25 - 11:31)
as well as a sandwich pick that will (11:27 - 11:32)
hold it all together (11:31 - 11:34)
once ready players will need to (11:32 - 11:37)
rearrange or need to arrange the (11:34 - 11:39)
ingredients on the bread stacking them (11:37 - 11:42)
carefully if not balanced properly it (11:39 - 11:44)
might accidentally cause the ingredients (11:42 - 11:46)
to topple over and or fall off the bread (11:44 - 11:49)
entirely players can also enjoy picnics (11:46 - 11:50)
with friends while playing together (11:49 - 11:52)
through the union Circle (11:50 - 11:55)
they will they just need to Simply (11:52 - 11:57)
approach the player's picnic while (11:55 - 11:58)
playing together for their friends to (11:57 - 12:00)
join (11:58 - 12:00)
so obviously this is the poffin's curry (12:01 - 12:12)
Pokey block gimmick of the game (12:07 - 12:12)
well they have it's like it's it's what (12:12 - 12:17)
it's like the camping as well right yeah (12:15 - 12:19)
it's kind of goes in with the camping (12:17 - 12:21)
whole thing (12:19 - 12:21)
talk about it (12:23 - 12:27)
in the press release but I'm pretty sure (12:24 - 12:29)
it's in the (12:27 - 12:32)
the video upset (12:29 - 12:32)
you get eggs (12:32 - 12:35)
you can get eggs (12:34 - 12:37)
yeah well let's get through the press (12:35 - 12:38)
release and we'll go back for the (12:37 - 12:39)
details here (12:38 - 12:42)
uh take care of Pokemon by washing them (12:39 - 12:45)
in these titles when a Pokemon walks (12:42 - 12:47)
alongside a player or battles it can get (12:45 - 12:51)
grimy and dirty by watching Pokemon at a (12:47 - 12:53)
picnic not only do they get clean but (12:51 - 12:55)
their HP will be restored and their bond (12:53 - 12:59)
with their trainer will become stronger (12:55 - 13:00)
and then finally (12:59 - 13:03)
introducing the TM machine a handy (13:00 - 13:06)
device that can make TMS a technical (13:03 - 13:10)
machine or a TM for short is a tool that (13:06 - 13:12)
allows Pokemon to learn new moves in (13:10 - 13:13)
these titles there is a piece of (13:12 - 13:15)
equipment installed at every Pokemon (13:13 - 13:17)
Center called the TM machine which (13:15 - 13:18)
allows trainers to make their own TMS (13:17 - 13:22)
TMS can be made using leak points LP for (13:18 - 13:24)
short and materials dropped by wild (13:22 - 13:27)
Pokemon after a battle LPS can be (13:24 - 13:29)
obtained as the player advances the (13:27 - 13:31)
story or by trading materials from a (13:29 - 13:35)
Pokemon the section of TMS available to (13:31 - 13:38)
make grow as a player continues their (13:35 - 13:40)
Adventure a single TM can only be used (13:38 - 13:42)
once but with enough LP and right (13:40 - 13:45)
materials from a Pokemon players can (13:42 - 13:48)
make as many as they'd like (13:45 - 13:48)
uh okay so that that was the first (13:50 - 13:56)
trailer it was 14 minutes long which (13:52 - 13:59)
very long for uh really only showing one (13:56 - 14:02)
new Pokemon saying that TMS are not (13:59 - 14:04)
limited showing picnics and then what (14:02 - 14:07)
was the last thing oh (14:04 - 14:09)
they brought back the thing from X and Y (14:07 - 14:11)
where you wash your Pokemon (14:09 - 14:13)
but uh okay so let's talk about the (14:11 - 14:14)
washing of the Pokemon because I think (14:13 - 14:16)
that's like the least interesting thing (14:14 - 14:18)
here yeah it was it was in X and Y it (14:16 - 14:20)
was in Sun and Moon it was in Ultra sun (14:18 - 14:23)
and moon it was not in sword and shield (14:20 - 14:25)
I guess you could say it was in let's go (14:23 - 14:27)
Pikachu let's go Eevee (14:25 - 14:28)
because you could you could brush them (14:27 - 14:32)
yeah you didn't wash them yeah like the (14:28 - 14:35)
motion of like brushing (14:32 - 14:38)
uh (14:35 - 14:38)
it's what just like the way to increase (14:39 - 14:44)
friendship just like throwing the French (14:42 - 14:48)
ball of Leon yeah and then like you're (14:44 - 14:50)
you're Stone Turner chases it and then (14:48 - 14:52)
that heart goes up yeah (14:50 - 14:54)
this is it it's not this is particularly (14:52 - 14:57)
interesting I mean it's fine right like (14:54 - 14:59)
we know it has to be in there every game (14:57 - 15:01)
now because that's like the focus for (14:59 - 15:02)
some Evolution except for sergeant (15:01 - 15:05)
Shield it was just gone well I mean (15:02 - 15:08)
there has to be a friendship mechanic uh (15:05 - 15:10)
playing mechanic and this is their (15:08 - 15:14)
playing mechanic which is washing them (15:10 - 15:14)
I think I would care about it more (15:14 - 15:20)
if it did something like they're like oh (15:17 - 15:22)
it heals your Pokemon but then also like (15:20 - 15:24)
you have to do it in a picnic and the (15:22 - 15:25)
picnic also there saying heals your (15:24 - 15:26)
Pokemon (15:25 - 15:28)
but isn't it making the sandwich heals (15:26 - 15:30)
your Pokemon not the picnic itself yeah (15:28 - 15:32)
that's true the sandwich wow (15:30 - 15:34)
why are you setting up a picnic if (15:32 - 15:37)
you're not making a sandwich (15:34 - 15:37)
yeah to do all the sandwich makings I'm (15:38 - 15:44)
not hungry yet we just had lunch but I (15:41 - 15:45)
want a record view if you're gonna (15:44 - 15:48)
unpack the table put the tablecloth down (15:45 - 15:49)
you know decorate it you might as well (15:48 - 15:51)
make a sandwich at that point (15:49 - 15:52)
but what if you're not hungry that's (15:51 - 15:54)
just a waste of food and resources (15:52 - 15:56)
let's see you know what if your Pokemon (15:54 - 15:57)
are hungry though it's not about you (15:56 - 16:00)
Greg it's about your Forever rig my my (15:57 - 16:02)
Pokemon are hungry when I say they're (16:00 - 16:05)
hungry and not a second more have you (16:02 - 16:08)
ever tried to feed dogs if you don't (16:05 - 16:09)
control that inflow they're just gonna (16:08 - 16:11)
eat everything and then they're gonna (16:09 - 16:14)
puke it up so no I'm going to make sure (16:11 - 16:16)
that I know the feeding schedule of My (16:14 - 16:18)
Pokemon so they don't have to be like in (16:16 - 16:19)
the middle of battle being like Oh I'm (16:18 - 16:21)
sorry I overfed them I'll just clean up (16:19 - 16:24)
this puke real quick (16:21 - 16:26)
or or it's the opposite where you're (16:24 - 16:28)
making Curry and certain Shields and (16:26 - 16:30)
you're like yo keep on eating this Curry (16:28 - 16:31)
leaves (16:30 - 16:33)
we need we need to increase this (16:31 - 16:35)
happiness eat eat they do have games (16:33 - 16:37)
that you can play at the picnic because (16:35 - 16:40)
they have a football soccer ball (16:37 - 16:43)
with an Eevee yeah oh I must have missed (16:40 - 16:45)
that in the trailer (16:43 - 16:45)
um yeah it's like the the washing thing (16:46 - 16:50)
is like here is a mechanic it just (16:48 - 16:53)
doesn't seem (16:50 - 16:53)
useful in any I haven't found the picnic (16:54 - 16:59)
or anything I did like I didn't find (16:57 - 17:01)
camping fun and laughing I rarely did it (16:59 - 17:04)
except if I had to create friendship and (17:01 - 17:06)
then I was like (17:04 - 17:09)
okay yeah so it's just the uh the the (17:06 - 17:11)
Fulfillment of the prophecy of keeping (17:09 - 17:12)
that dog clean (17:11 - 17:14)
finally correct fine you can keep that (17:12 - 17:18)
dog clean your Fido can be washed so (17:14 - 17:21)
picnics same as like (17:18 - 17:25)
uh Curry same as poffins was there any (17:21 - 17:28)
of these mechanics in past well black (17:25 - 17:29)
and white didn't have any of this right (17:28 - 17:33)
black and white had just like the movies (17:29 - 17:33)
yeah the musicals the music musicals (17:35 - 17:41)
um did you guys like any of these past (17:39 - 17:42)
mechanics I know some people did like (17:41 - 17:44)
Curry some people liked poffin some (17:42 - 17:46)
people were like ah bulky blocks were (17:44 - 17:47)
better (17:46 - 17:51)
I didn't hate puffins (17:47 - 17:54)
I liked polka blocks but only if I was (17:51 - 17:56)
with people and we could do it correctly (17:54 - 17:59)
musicals never lived up to their promise (17:56 - 18:01)
and the movies never lived up to their (17:59 - 18:03)
promise I didn't like making Curry (18:01 - 18:06)
either wait didn't black and white have (18:03 - 18:08)
the egg spinner (18:06 - 18:11)
uh yeah everybody put it in an egg and (18:08 - 18:13)
then you spun it around and then you got (18:11 - 18:15)
a random egg (18:13 - 18:18)
that's like the equivalent of pokeblocks (18:15 - 18:20)
yeah because it's like when you're when (18:18 - 18:22)
you're doing multiplayer and like (18:20 - 18:23)
everybody like puts in an egg and then (18:22 - 18:25)
you don't know what you're gonna get (18:23 - 18:28)
this this is (18:25 - 18:29)
what I'll say (18:28 - 18:33)
I know what's what's always funny is uh (18:29 - 18:34)
sometimes when I think about like (18:33 - 18:36)
features I'm like excited about (18:34 - 18:38)
I'm gonna complain about the Tia Machine (18:36 - 18:40)
by the way just a heads up I don't like (18:38 - 18:43)
it so machine but sometimes when we get (18:40 - 18:45)
reviews we always get like like uh (18:43 - 18:46)
somebody will give us a one star review (18:45 - 18:48)
or two star review and they'll be like (18:46 - 18:50)
the show is so negative and then I like (18:48 - 18:52)
think back and I'm like okay what were (18:50 - 18:53)
we negative about the last episode and (18:52 - 18:55)
was like oh well Niantic would did (18:53 - 18:56)
something dumb I feel like that was (18:55 - 18:59)
valid to be nice and then I'm like oh I (18:56 - 19:01)
I I'm gonna I'm gonna this episode say (18:59 - 19:04)
that I like picnics and then I guess (19:01 - 19:05)
maybe that's not valid at all like (19:04 - 19:08)
awesome Steve likes the picnics but he (19:05 - 19:11)
hates the team like yeah (19:08 - 19:15)
I did enjoy curries uh and I the reason (19:11 - 19:16)
I liked it (19:15 - 19:19)
is because I it was there it was a decks (19:16 - 19:21)
and there was like an end goal to it (19:19 - 19:23)
right (19:21 - 19:27)
and and I as as funny as it was like 151 (19:23 - 19:31)
curries I I like when the I like when (19:27 - 19:34)
video games give me a reward for doing (19:31 - 19:35)
something (19:34 - 19:38)
so golden rails to make more curry yeah (19:35 - 19:40)
so the golden Ladle thing (19:38 - 19:44)
um I liked playing curries with other (19:40 - 19:45)
people but that was almost impossible (19:44 - 19:47)
right I like like you could stand (19:45 - 19:49)
somewhere in the wild area and then have (19:47 - 19:51)
somebody else like go in and out of like (19:49 - 19:54)
the gate to then hopefully be in your (19:51 - 19:56)
game session (19:54 - 19:58)
so you were kind of stuck doing it by (19:56 - 20:03)
yourself to complete your Curry decks (19:58 - 20:05)
yeah a LAN party there were different (20:03 - 20:07)
levels like you could try to charge our (20:05 - 20:09)
class everything or copper Raja class (20:07 - 20:10)
everything that didn't actually matter (20:09 - 20:11)
if you wanted to complete your Curry (20:10 - 20:14)
decks you just needed 151 and I did (20:11 - 20:16)
think it was kind of clever that there (20:14 - 20:17)
was like two or three curries that you (20:16 - 20:19)
needed to like trade for because one (20:17 - 20:21)
game had like Bob's beans and the other (20:19 - 20:23)
games had like Fred's hot dogs and you (20:21 - 20:25)
had to like trade those in order to (20:23 - 20:27)
complete it (20:25 - 20:29)
although the actual mechanic wasn't (20:27 - 20:32)
super great and it was there was there (20:29 - 20:34)
was a frustrating part where some (20:32 - 20:35)
berries were better than other berries (20:34 - 20:37)
but like there was no real way to (20:35 - 20:39)
indicate that and like Serebii didn't (20:37 - 20:41)
report or say that and the the player's (20:39 - 20:44)
guide was like way to go Joe and it (20:41 - 20:46)
wasn't literally until like six months (20:44 - 20:48)
ago like a data Miner was like here's (20:46 - 20:50)
how actual Curry hunting worked and I (20:48 - 20:54)
was like jeez this is so complicated and (20:50 - 20:56)
literally nowhere does it say that so I (20:54 - 20:58)
think I do think that Curry hunting was (20:56 - 21:02)
the best of all of these games (20:58 - 21:05)
um but my issues I just said it seems (21:02 - 21:06)
like picnics fix that it seems like (21:05 - 21:08)
it'll be really easy to do that with (21:06 - 21:10)
other people I would really hope that (21:08 - 21:13)
you know there is a picnic decks where (21:10 - 21:15)
uh you get something when you complete (21:13 - 21:17)
it I hope that there's like something to (21:15 - 21:19)
complete because at a certain point (21:17 - 21:20)
improv you're probably just doing (21:19 - 21:22)
picnics to increase your friendship but (21:20 - 21:23)
then they did the other thing which is (21:22 - 21:26)
there they said they casually dropped (21:23 - 21:27)
this they were like oh if you do a (21:26 - 21:30)
picnic you might get an egg (21:27 - 21:33)
and there were some people I saw that (21:30 - 21:34)
were like oh does that mean there's no (21:33 - 21:36)
breeding (21:34 - 21:40)
I don't think that's true I just think (21:36 - 21:42)
that (21:40 - 21:44)
they're they they were like hey if (21:42 - 21:46)
people are doing this over and over we (21:44 - 21:48)
need to reward them for their time in (21:46 - 21:50)
some way because another thing that I (21:48 - 21:52)
did really really like about Curry (21:50 - 21:54)
hunting is you could attract Pokemon (21:52 - 21:56)
through Curry and it's funny because I (21:54 - 21:58)
made a tick tock about that and people (21:56 - 22:00)
were like I had no clue this feature (21:58 - 22:02)
existed and because the game doesn't (22:00 - 22:04)
tell you (22:02 - 22:06)
you can do that and also it doesn't work (22:04 - 22:08)
in the wild area so if you're only (22:06 - 22:09)
camping in the wild area it's never (22:08 - 22:11)
going to work so the game doesn't tell (22:09 - 22:13)
you that the game doesn't tell you that (22:11 - 22:15)
the better way to attract Curry Pokemon (22:13 - 22:18)
is to have Max friendship in there there (22:15 - 22:20)
were so many rumors or speculation of (22:18 - 22:22)
how that worked of like oh you need a (22:20 - 22:24)
Pokemon that has like a a sociable (22:22 - 22:26)
ribbon on it or you need to only have (22:24 - 22:28)
five Pokemon in your party not six or (22:26 - 22:32)
you need to like none of that was true (22:28 - 22:32)
um but I think that's what it is right I (22:33 - 22:36)
think that (22:35 - 22:39)
instead of a Pokemon being attracted to (22:36 - 22:41)
your party because you made Curry I (22:39 - 22:43)
think they're saying you make a good (22:41 - 22:44)
sandwich you'll randomly find the egg (22:43 - 22:47)
and my suspicion is that egg will (22:44 - 22:51)
probably be a different Terra type (22:47 - 22:54)
and that's how they that's how they like (22:51 - 22:57)
encourage you to do this mechanic I (22:54 - 22:59)
don't know what egg you're getting (22:57 - 23:03)
I I would guess it would be the same (22:59 - 23:06)
like Curry hunting so if you Curry (23:03 - 23:08)
hunted in Glenwood tangle you'd get like (23:06 - 23:12)
Ponyta impedimp uh whatever indeedy so (23:08 - 23:15)
if you Curry hunt by I don't like a a (23:12 - 23:18)
not a spoink what is that pig called (23:15 - 23:21)
let's talk how dare you if you if you (23:18 - 23:24)
Curry hunt near a Le chunk I would (23:21 - 23:25)
assume that you would probably be more (23:24 - 23:28)
likely to get a Le chunk egg (23:25 - 23:30)
and that LE chunk would be like grass (23:28 - 23:31)
instead of (23:30 - 23:35)
the fire or whatever yeah (23:31 - 23:37)
that's a huge guess for sure but like (23:35 - 23:41)
I'm just guessing I don't think the eggs (23:37 - 23:43)
mean that there's no breeding in this (23:41 - 23:45)
game (23:43 - 23:45)
yeah that's just a way to get eggs yeah (23:46 - 23:51)
a lot of people I've seen a lot of (23:50 - 23:52)
people freaking out like this is the (23:51 - 23:54)
breeding mechanic and oh and I'm like we (23:52 - 23:57)
don't know that but also (23:54 - 23:59)
I hope it's not as obtuse as Curry (23:57 - 24:03)
hunting was like I hope it if it if this (23:59 - 24:06)
is the breeding mechanic like and there (24:03 - 24:09)
isn't a daycare somewhere which would be (24:06 - 24:12)
wild to me but if it isn't that it had (24:09 - 24:16)
better be spelled out plainly what you (24:12 - 24:18)
need to do I would find it so hard to (24:16 - 24:19)
believe that they would go from a game (24:18 - 24:22)
that had two daycares that you could (24:19 - 24:25)
mass-produce eggs to a game with no day (24:22 - 24:28)
cares and no way to mass produce it (24:25 - 24:30)
looks we they we never know what they're (24:28 - 24:33)
gonna do snubble wasn't in the English (24:30 - 24:36)
reason so let's let's just admit (24:33 - 24:39)
Everything Is Awesome (24:36 - 24:39)
yeah I (24:44 - 24:48)
like that but that's like a different (24:46 - 24:50)
problem with Pokemon where they have all (24:48 - 24:53)
of these NPCs (24:50 - 24:55)
and none of them tell you anything (24:53 - 24:57)
valuable (24:55 - 24:58)
like do you remember in sun and moon (24:57 - 25:02)
when when you went to uh (24:58 - 25:04)
it was like the second island and there (25:02 - 25:07)
was a laboratory where sycamore's wife (25:04 - 25:09)
lives I can't remember her name (25:07 - 25:12)
sycamore's wife not Sycamore sorry uh (25:09 - 25:15)
wife kakui's wife sorry a lot of hot men (25:12 - 25:19)
in my head yeah there are so you you go (25:15 - 25:21)
you go up that laboratory and there's (25:19 - 25:24)
like a a team skull grunt (25:21 - 25:27)
and he he says I heard that Shiny (25:24 - 25:29)
Pokemon are rare and he's like there's I (25:27 - 25:31)
think he says like there's like a one in (25:29 - 25:34)
four thousand eight hundred and six like (25:31 - 25:36)
he says he he tells you what the shine (25:34 - 25:39)
yeah and he's just a random dude in a (25:36 - 25:42)
hallway and what I I still it's (25:39 - 25:44)
dumbfounds me in Pokemon games that you (25:42 - 25:46)
you have so many NPCs that just say (25:44 - 25:48)
literally nothing (25:46 - 25:51)
like why in sword and shield is there (25:48 - 25:54)
not an NPC that's like hey I heard if (25:51 - 25:57)
your Pokemon party is incredibly happy (25:54 - 26:00)
and you Curry hunt in this Forest you (25:57 - 26:02)
could attract (26:00 - 26:03)
a Pokemon (26:02 - 26:05)
like literally no one's maybe actually (26:03 - 26:07)
maybe somebody does but I I have talked (26:05 - 26:09)
to every person I have two two thousand (26:07 - 26:11)
plus hours in sword and shield I've (26:09 - 26:12)
definitely talked to every person and no (26:11 - 26:14)
one has said anything of value in that (26:12 - 26:16)
case (26:14 - 26:16)
there have been some valuable (26:16 - 26:20)
conversations in that game there is a (26:18 - 26:22)
person that tells you what the weather (26:20 - 26:23)
is (26:22 - 26:27)
yeah that's true but (26:23 - 26:29)
I I I I I don't get it I just don't get (26:27 - 26:31)
why (26:29 - 26:34)
why there's so many complicated (26:31 - 26:37)
mechanics in Pokemon but but you have to (26:34 - 26:39)
either rely on some dude on Twitter to (26:37 - 26:41)
datamine it you have to rely that Joe (26:39 - 26:44)
from Sarah B cares enough to update his (26:41 - 26:46)
website with that information uh or you (26:44 - 26:49)
have to hope that like a streamer or a (26:46 - 26:52)
YouTuber tells you that information like (26:49 - 26:54)
why (26:52 - 26:57)
it's like the whole like Elden ring (26:54 - 26:58)
thing like I'm playing Elden ring and (26:57 - 27:00)
I'm like (26:58 - 27:02)
I get there that you do it on your own (27:00 - 27:04)
no hand-holding that kind of stuff but (27:02 - 27:08)
how am I supposed to know that I need to (27:04 - 27:10)
do this (27:08 - 27:12)
without going to a website and looking (27:10 - 27:13)
it up is that what is that what they (27:12 - 27:16)
want me to do rail of Discovery how am I (27:13 - 27:18)
supposed to know that I need like a one (27:16 - 27:20)
HP yeah mask and I'm supposed to walk (27:18 - 27:22)
under a giant brick thing and then there (27:20 - 27:24)
should be a sandstorm and then it (27:22 - 27:26)
evolves who's supposed to figure this (27:24 - 27:28)
out how do we know how things work in (27:26 - 27:30)
real life (27:28 - 27:30)
and they did the trial and error to (27:33 - 27:38)
figure it out that's how the real world (27:36 - 27:41)
works now I I do agree that Pokemon has (27:38 - 27:42)
this (27:41 - 27:45)
philosophy of some things just should (27:42 - 27:48)
always be hidden and it's (27:45 - 27:53)
fun to figure them out (27:48 - 27:53)
anyone had fun of all the gear masks (27:53 - 27:59)
actually I don't think I actually ever (27:57 - 28:02)
evolved ayad mask to be honest I don't (27:59 - 28:04)
think I did either I think I did a raid (28:02 - 28:06)
for uh I think I did a rate for it it (28:04 - 28:08)
was like I don't care I'm just gonna get (28:06 - 28:10)
the final form I evolved everyone rigas (28:08 - 28:13)
why did you have fun doing it do you (28:10 - 28:15)
enjoy it I can tell by your voice I mean (28:13 - 28:17)
and your posture that you had the best (28:15 - 28:20)
time I got it done and it was over (28:17 - 28:25)
then I moved on with my life I I don't (28:20 - 28:27)
it's like didn't they also sort of (28:25 - 28:29)
basically not say how to evolve Inkay (28:27 - 28:31)
when Inkay first came out you're like (28:29 - 28:35)
what do I do I I think everything is on (28:31 - 28:37)
Twitter how to I think there are guys on (28:35 - 28:39)
Twitter upside down and wasn't the other (28:37 - 28:41)
what's the other one is it Pancham that (28:39 - 28:43)
has to have a dark type (28:41 - 28:44)
yes it has to have a dark type in your (28:43 - 28:47)
party Whispering they love keeping these (28:44 - 28:49)
things a secret because it's supposedly (28:47 - 28:51)
finding the mystery of how Pokemon Works (28:49 - 28:54)
would really when you're not a kid and (28:51 - 28:56)
you don't care and you're like I want to (28:54 - 28:58)
complete my desk and you're old it's (28:56 - 29:01)
just annoying just tell me well okay (28:58 - 29:03)
there was like there was like an article (29:01 - 29:04)
that came out yesterday uh like last (29:03 - 29:06)
week (29:04 - 29:07)
um (29:06 - 29:08)
or maybe it was like a huge tweet thread (29:07 - 29:09)
I don't actually remember it but it (29:08 - 29:11)
comes it comes up every like once a year (29:09 - 29:15)
where where uh somebody who it wasn't (29:11 - 29:17)
masuta from Game Freak (29:15 - 29:20)
uh they were like the the the the the (29:17 - 29:23)
Arceus flute was way too complicated for (29:20 - 29:25)
players so that's why we didn't include (29:23 - 29:26)
it (29:25 - 29:29)
um and then (29:26 - 29:29)
you then they they prior to that they (29:30 - 29:34)
did like the Reggie thing where like (29:32 - 29:35)
they expected their players to like (29:34 - 29:38)
learn Braille and understand like you (29:35 - 29:40)
need to like dig underwater in front of (29:38 - 29:43)
this cave to get to like the Regis it's (29:40 - 29:44)
okay (29:43 - 29:47)
to have (29:44 - 29:50)
harder or more complicated mechanics in (29:47 - 29:52)
your game (29:50 - 29:56)
but why in nowhere in your game does it (29:52 - 29:59)
try to like lead you that way or to give (29:56 - 30:03)
you hints or like you're like well the (29:59 - 30:04)
Reggie stuff was too hard our players (30:03 - 30:06)
were too dumb to figure it out and it's (30:04 - 30:08)
like (30:06 - 30:08)
what what like you you created the (30:09 - 30:16)
mechanic if you think it's too hard then (30:12 - 30:18)
have an NPC standing somewhere being (30:16 - 30:21)
like here's the hint now you're supposed (30:18 - 30:25)
to call the Nintendo helpline helpline (30:21 - 30:28)
for a tip (30:25 - 30:30)
they are lonely and they need people to (30:28 - 30:32)
call (30:30 - 30:33)
and then it's like and then people (30:32 - 30:35)
complain that they dumb down mechanics (30:33 - 30:36)
but then they then they make something (30:35 - 30:38)
like ruin Regis and you're like what do (30:36 - 30:41)
you what are you doing (30:38 - 30:41)
like what is happening over here like (30:44 - 30:50)
this is too hard this is too hard (30:47 - 30:53)
in this game a Pokemon that only evolves (30:50 - 30:55)
by using a specific soap while washing (30:53 - 30:56)
them (30:55 - 30:59)
oh you know you might be out here I'm (30:56 - 31:01)
I'm calling it now (30:59 - 31:05)
you must use a very specific soap a (31:01 - 31:08)
teracelized soap and you have to learn (31:05 - 31:10)
how to make the soap (31:08 - 31:15)
in in the crown Tundra there is uh (31:10 - 31:16)
there's a raid Den that doesn't do (31:15 - 31:18)
anything and there's like five rocks (31:16 - 31:22)
around the raid Den and you need to have (31:18 - 31:24)
uh Regice (31:22 - 31:27)
Reggie Rock Registeel Reggie Drago (31:24 - 31:30)
Reggie ellicky all in your party and (31:27 - 31:33)
then you go to that raid den and then it (31:30 - 31:36)
lights up and Regigigas appears (31:33 - 31:38)
number one I'm sure half the people (31:36 - 31:39)
listening to that was like oh you can (31:38 - 31:41)
catch Reggie gigas in the crown Tundra (31:39 - 31:44)
yes it's like the raid Den above the (31:41 - 31:46)
graveyard with five little rocks around (31:44 - 31:49)
it there's a raid in above the graveyard (31:46 - 31:51)
yeah like there's a hill above the (31:49 - 31:52)
graveyard and when you walk up that (31:51 - 31:54)
there's a raid Den that never lights up (31:52 - 31:56)
and there's five rocks around it I have (31:54 - 31:59)
no idea and again there's there's like (31:56 - 32:01)
what seven NPCs in the crown Tundra and (31:59 - 32:03)
like six of them live in that little (32:01 - 32:04)
town yeah and they're talking about (32:03 - 32:07)
sweaters yeah yeah exactly they're (32:04 - 32:10)

course you do because there's a train (32:51 - 32:55)
coming thanks this is worthless dialogue (32:52 - 32:59)
I was all those NPCs are talking about (32:55 - 33:01)
sweaters why one of them says like hey (32:59 - 33:04)
isn't that rain done with the five rocks (33:01 - 33:07)
around it weird I wonder if that has to (33:04 - 33:09)
do with the temples there I wrote the (33:07 - 33:11)
dialogue for you there it is but just (33:09 - 33:13)
copy and paste this text you can now (33:11 - 33:15)
have voice acting in your game you free (33:13 - 33:17)
use of what I just said applied to that (33:15 - 33:20)
that was bad do it again retake (33:17 - 33:23)
well what's your NPC advice you'd you'd (33:20 - 33:27)
talk about knitting right oh (33:23 - 33:30)
yeah but what's like relevance to my (33:27 - 33:31)
area (33:30 - 33:35)
of of the the region (33:31 - 33:38)
my house is between two Lakes I don't (33:35 - 33:40)
know (33:38 - 33:42)
everybody stops this between two lakes (33:40 - 33:43)
here (33:42 - 33:46)
everything's between two lakes that (33:43 - 33:48)
narrows it down to Nowhere avian (33:46 - 33:51)
includes Wisconsin at that point (33:48 - 33:52)
um (33:51 - 33:55)
I have no I I would just be like the (33:52 - 33:57)
technology is amazing look things up on (33:55 - 33:59)
the internet (33:57 - 34:01)
you can find all kinds of information on (33:59 - 34:03)
the internet these days when I was a kid (34:01 - 34:05)
we just made stuff up because we didn't (34:03 - 34:07)
have the internet (34:05 - 34:12)
uh do we do we like for referig no (34:07 - 34:14)
what (34:12 - 34:14)
I don't mind for efferig (34:15 - 34:20)
did we like giraffarig no (34:17 - 34:23)
okay all right I it didn't start at a (34:20 - 34:25)
place that I enjoyed it like did I say (34:23 - 34:28)
for Rafa rig how dare you look I don't (34:25 - 34:31)
know I'm saying it for a giraffe fridge (34:28 - 34:35)
sorry for a giraffe yeah so I it was (34:31 - 34:38)
never huge on girafford it was fine it (34:35 - 34:39)
was mostly forgettable to me the only (34:38 - 34:40)
thing I know is like the Chinese got a (34:39 - 34:43)
blue tongue like in reality this time (34:41 - 34:45)
when I first saw it blue I literally (34:43 - 34:47)
thought (34:45 - 34:48)
who (34:47 - 34:51)
stuck a space helmet on that poor (34:48 - 34:52)
giraffe (34:51 - 34:54)
why are you doing this because I'm like (34:52 - 34:56)
we're going into space and then I'm like (34:54 - 34:58)
oh why does it I don't like why does it (34:56 - 34:59)
have teeth (34:58 - 35:01)
why does Brock have a rocket ship that's (34:59 - 35:04)
that you said I'd have a rocket ship why (35:01 - 35:08)
what is going on the world (35:04 - 35:11)
here's I will say this I don't like its (35:08 - 35:13)
official artwork but people's drawing is (35:11 - 35:17)
of it on Twitter I do like (35:13 - 35:19)
one of those things where when you see (35:17 - 35:21)
it in game it seems more personable and (35:19 - 35:23)
and but I watched it in the trailer and (35:21 - 35:25)
I'm like no this is weird I don't (35:23 - 35:28)
it looks like a giraffe (35:25 - 35:31)
the the complaint I saw about it wasn't (35:28 - 35:33)
its design uh it was people that were (35:31 - 35:36)
bummed out respectfully so I think for (35:33 - 35:38)
um it's typing it keeps the psychic (35:36 - 35:40)
normal typing (35:38 - 35:42)
um I think I think the the consensus was (35:40 - 35:45)
people wanted to be like psychic dark (35:42 - 35:48)
which isn't that like Malamar I think (35:45 - 35:50)
it's psychic dark yes yeah (35:48 - 35:51)
um (35:50 - 35:54)
you know what bums me out you know what (35:51 - 35:56)
really grinds my gear what what bombs (35:54 - 36:00)
yeah we get of all of all the Gen 2 (35:56 - 36:03)
single ones we have yet to see Dunsparce (36:00 - 36:05)
Love Is there is there a list of Gen 2 (36:03 - 36:07)
Pokemon that have not been touched at (36:05 - 36:09)
this point quill fish got some treatment (36:07 - 36:12)
quill fish got love uh obviously giraffe (36:09 - 36:15)
rig I like the design I think it's I (36:12 - 36:16)
think it's great (36:15 - 36:18)
um I think its name is super clever too (36:16 - 36:20)
for those that don't know giraffe's name (36:18 - 36:21)
is a palindrome which means it's like (36:20 - 36:24)
this the same phone backwards (36:21 - 36:27)
um so for for rigor wraps is is also a (36:24 - 36:29)
palindrome it's the same forward as it (36:27 - 36:31)
is backwards (36:29 - 36:32)
um yeah only one that I think is left (36:31 - 36:36)
that's a single form Gen 2 is Sudowoodo (36:32 - 36:36)
no that like I was talking about (36:37 - 36:42)
Evolution Past but it's got an evolution (36:39 - 36:46)
pre Heracross got a mega uh Yen yanma (36:42 - 36:48)
got Mega yanma (36:46 - 36:50)
what (36:48 - 36:52)
Beyond Mega (36:50 - 36:56)
whatever I was like I don't remember (36:52 - 36:58)
murkrow got haunch Crow yeah misrevius (36:56 - 37:03)
magias Wobbuffet got why not (36:58 - 37:04)
is it literally just done sparse now (37:03 - 37:08)
yeah it is literally just done sparse at (37:04 - 37:10)
this point and it's a fence well chuckle (37:08 - 37:12)
chuckle get anything oh Shuckle didn't (37:10 - 37:14)
get anything all right there are two (37:12 - 37:16)
well check out doesn't check us pads the (37:14 - 37:17)
second doesn't count (37:16 - 37:19)
I like charcoal no (37:17 - 37:21)
I don't know (37:19 - 37:24)
Mantine got it Skarmory Discovery (37:21 - 37:26)
Skarmory did not get anything I mean (37:24 - 37:27)
where you got corbinite just you know (37:26 - 37:29)
they're not related but corvinite is the (37:27 - 37:31)
better that weird ear (37:29 - 37:34)
doesn't have anything I don't think (37:31 - 37:36)
smeargle deserves anything (37:34 - 37:40)
what rude smeargle has its own exclusive (37:36 - 37:42)
move (37:40 - 37:44)
the only other person the Pokemon that (37:42 - 37:46)
can learn sketch I think is Mew (37:44 - 37:49)
I tell the new one the new One's Gonna (37:46 - 37:50)
Get it (37:49 - 37:54)
yeah that's just too problematic uh (37:50 - 37:57)
problematic child uh yeah I think (37:54 - 38:00)
smeargle is good enough where it doesn't (37:57 - 38:02)
like need something to like make it it (38:00 - 38:03)
needs an evolution where it can learn (38:02 - 38:06)
paint 3D paint 3D modeling where it (38:03 - 38:08)
makes how it makes a substitute that (38:06 - 38:10)
looks like itself (38:08 - 38:12)
uh (38:10 - 38:14)
crazy to me that they should a 14 minute (38:12 - 38:16)
trailer and they're like here's one (38:14 - 38:17)
Pokemon but uh whatever (38:16 - 38:20)
uh but was it (38:17 - 38:23)
oh yeah yeah Secrets yeah yeah that's (38:20 - 38:28)
that's true uh that that (38:23 - 38:30)
there you know this company's very bad (38:28 - 38:31)
at copying pasting because in the (38:30 - 38:33)
Japanese trailer they didn't have that (38:31 - 38:34)
stuff on the mini-map in the English (38:33 - 38:36)
trailer they did have that stuff (38:34 - 38:38)
uh we'll talk about that in a second uh (38:36 - 38:40)
we need to complain now so now this is (38:38 - 38:42)
the part of the podcast where you're (38:40 - 38:45)
like oh they do is all right the t t (38:42 - 38:47)
machines machine (38:45 - 38:50)
it is the T the the so the TM stands for (38:47 - 38:52)
Technical Machine but it is called the (38:50 - 38:55)
TM machine so it's the technical machine (38:52 - 38:57)
machine just like people say the ATM (38:55 - 38:59)
machine now come on this has been a (38:57 - 39:00)
problem since the age just like people (38:59 - 39:03)
say chai tea which is how chai is (39:00 - 39:06)
referred to in America it isn't loud I (39:03 - 39:07)
watched a whole Tick Tock about what (39:06 - 39:09)
that means and why it's an appropriate (39:07 - 39:11)
use of language so people are like you (39:09 - 39:14)
should say it twice go to tick tock find (39:11 - 39:15)
the linguist that talks about why that's (39:14 - 39:18)
a valid part of speech and also wait (39:15 - 39:20)
also you can't complain unless you can (39:18 - 39:23)
tell me what the at in ATM stands for (39:20 - 39:26)
which I can guarantee 90 of you have no (39:23 - 39:28)
idea did I ever tell you about the time (39:26 - 39:31)
in my head now (39:28 - 39:35)
the the T is time no no it's not five (39:31 - 39:40)
machines no it is uh okay Steve doesn't (39:35 - 39:43)
know what it is I'm too you were born (39:40 - 39:45)
you were they weren't new you were bored (39:43 - 39:47)
when they were already here (39:45 - 39:50)
will and I had to be introduced to the (39:47 - 39:53)
automated or automatic (39:50 - 39:58)
teller machine I said on ATM yeah you (39:53 - 40:00)
said automatic time machine which is not (39:58 - 40:01)
a thing (40:00 - 40:04)
because in Wisconsin okay here's the (40:01 - 40:07)
thing here's here's the thing (40:04 - 40:08)
bubbler is also a terrible Wisconsin (40:07 - 40:11)
thing but I had finished who came from (40:08 - 40:13)
Wisconsin and the first ATMs were from (40:11 - 40:16)
the time bank so the only ATMs that (40:13 - 40:19)
existed in Wisconsin were labeled time (40:16 - 40:22)
so they came to Minnesota and one day in (40:19 - 40:25)
college turned to me and said where's a (40:22 - 40:28)
time machine to which I said those (40:25 - 40:29)
things aren't real (40:28 - 40:32)
that's science fiction and they said no (40:29 - 40:35)
it's not you get cash from it I said how (40:32 - 40:38)
do you get cash from a time machine its (40:35 - 40:40)
own purpose is to travel through time (40:38 - 40:43)
and they went no not that time time a (40:40 - 40:45)
bank I said I don't even know what that (40:43 - 40:47)
is because we don't have time Banks here (40:45 - 40:49)
I said are you talking about an ATM and (40:47 - 40:51)
they said what's that I said this where (40:49 - 40:53)
you get cash from a machine because it's (40:51 - 40:55)
an automated tailor machine this is the (40:53 - 40:57)
worst Abbott and Costello moment of my (40:55 - 40:59)
life it happened in real time and were (40:57 - 41:03)
surprised that I survived it (40:59 - 41:05)
I'm not going to survive the TM machine (41:03 - 41:09)
it's awesome I hate crafting yeah so I I (41:05 - 41:11)
think I think the actual takeaway from (41:09 - 41:13)
the TM machine I almost said time (41:11 - 41:16)
machine uh is that you can walk up to (41:13 - 41:17)
any of these machines they're in Pokemon (41:16 - 41:19)
centers (41:17 - 41:23)
um and you can uh (41:19 - 41:24)
uh make (41:23 - 41:28)
TMS pretty much stating that TMS are not (41:24 - 41:31)
Unlimited (41:28 - 41:31)
no they're one single use but you can (41:32 - 41:38)
make as many as you want yeah which is (41:35 - 41:41)
the problem (41:38 - 41:46)
so in in older Pokemon games (41:41 - 41:46)
this is how I was as a player and maybe (41:48 - 41:53)
not everyone was the same as a player (41:50 - 41:55)
let me let me give you my gaming (41:53 - 41:57)
experience uh first I'm gonna start with (41:55 - 42:00)
a non-pokemon example I played through (41:57 - 42:02)
all of The Last of Us (42:00 - 42:05)
and in The Last of Us it is a game where (42:02 - 42:08)
uh they make it the some of the (42:05 - 42:09)
difficulty I would say all of the (42:08 - 42:13)
difficulty is like your resources and (42:09 - 42:14)
because you can craft (42:13 - 42:18)
and I went through the Last of Us saving (42:14 - 42:21)
a lot of the best weapons because I was (42:18 - 42:23)
scared to use them in case there was a (42:21 - 42:24)
harder (42:23 - 42:27)
zone or battle right like oh I'm not (42:24 - 42:30)
going to waste my shotgun on these (42:27 - 42:34)
characters because uh what if (42:30 - 42:37)
later on I'm gonna need that shotgun (42:34 - 42:40)
and then because because there was there (42:37 - 42:43)
was ammo that was plentiful like for (42:40 - 42:45)
your handgun and then there was ammo (42:43 - 42:46)
that was more rare I'm just gonna use (42:45 - 42:48)
shotgun for an example (42:46 - 42:50)
um and obviously some guns were better (42:48 - 42:53)
than other guns and so I was like okay (42:50 - 42:55)
great I have I have like a flamethrower (42:53 - 42:57)
I have I have all these really powerful (42:55 - 42:59)
weapons that I'm saving till the end of (42:57 - 43:01)
the game where ideally it will get (42:59 - 43:03)
harder and then I (43:01 - 43:05)
all of a sudden the game the game was (43:03 - 43:07)
over I I was like Oh I thought there was (43:05 - 43:09)
going to be more I didn't know that this (43:07 - 43:12)
was like the final encounters and I (43:09 - 43:15)
I'm done and I never actually use like (43:12 - 43:17)
these three weapons now now that is that (43:15 - 43:20)
is my fault (43:17 - 43:23)
but I was I was scared to use those (43:20 - 43:25)
those weapons because I I didn't know (43:23 - 43:27)
what was coming (43:25 - 43:29)
and I was like well if it gets harder I (43:27 - 43:31)
can switch to those weapons and I've (43:29 - 43:32)
actually had this conversation with (43:31 - 43:33)
other people and there are people that (43:32 - 43:35)
match my playstyle pretty (43:33 - 43:36)
um (43:35 - 43:39)
match my play style of like I don't you (43:36 - 43:40)
know I I didn't use these weapons (43:39 - 43:41)
because I wasn't sure when I was gonna (43:40 - 43:43)
need them and then it turns out the game (43:41 - 43:45)
is over and I didn't end up using them (43:43 - 43:47)
and I felt the same way in early Pokemon (43:45 - 43:51)
games where I only have one earthquake (43:47 - 43:55)
and I I don't know who to teach that to (43:51 - 43:57)
and what if I teach it to this Pokemon (43:55 - 43:58)
but that's not the right thing and now I (43:57 - 44:00)
don't have an earthquake anymore (43:58 - 44:01)
um (44:00 - 44:04)
and that's like super unfortunate and (44:01 - 44:08)
then again and even even when I go back (44:04 - 44:10)
and I play (44:08 - 44:14)
and I Nuzlocke like uh like uh uh I'm a (44:10 - 44:16)
Pokemon Platinum (44:14 - 44:20)
it's like I this is my only (44:16 - 44:22)
this is my only horn drill that's that's (44:20 - 44:24)
a bad example this is my only horn drill (44:22 - 44:26)
and I don't know if I want to teach it (44:24 - 44:27)
to this Pokemon because like (44:26 - 44:30)
what it what if what if they what if (44:27 - 44:32)
they die and then uh and then all of a (44:30 - 44:33)
sudden like I I don't have that Pokemon (44:32 - 44:35)
and I also don't have horn drill and (44:33 - 44:37)
then now the game is is even more hard (44:35 - 44:39)
because I I use my one good Ice Beam is (44:37 - 44:40)
probably a better example although I (44:39 - 44:43)
think I think you buy ice beam and there (44:40 - 44:45)
are some TMS that you could just buy in (44:43 - 44:48)
a store but there are some TMS you can't (44:45 - 44:50)
and then black and white fixed that all (44:48 - 44:53)
black and white was like you want ice (44:50 - 44:58)
beam cool as many as you want (44:53 - 45:01)
and it doesn't (44:58 - 45:04)
it doesn't all of a sudden make the game (45:01 - 45:06)
easier which is the counter argument to (45:04 - 45:08)
that because somebody's gonna be like (45:06 - 45:10)
well you know it made the game harder (45:08 - 45:12)
because you had to strategize who you (45:10 - 45:14)
were going to teach the Ice Beam to and (45:12 - 45:15)
like (45:14 - 45:17)
if if you if you think icebeam is an (45:15 - 45:19)
overpowered move and you think it makes (45:17 - 45:20)
the game easier then just don't teach (45:19 - 45:22)
your Pokemon Ice Beam you have complete (45:20 - 45:25)
control of that situation like if you (45:22 - 45:26)
got (45:25 - 45:29)
ThunderBolt from Lieutenant Serge back (45:26 - 45:32)
in back in uh uh red and blue you could (45:29 - 45:34)
do one of two things you could either (45:32 - 45:35)
wait (45:34 - 45:38)
for Pikachu to get to level 54 and teach (45:35 - 45:40)
it Thunderbolt or (45:38 - 45:43)
you could teach a thunderbolt and not (45:40 - 45:45)
wait or you could save your Thunderbolt (45:43 - 45:46)
for something else but she only still (45:45 - 45:49)
had one Thunderbolt (45:46 - 45:51)
like Thunderbolt I believe is (45:49 - 45:53)
Thunderbolt Thunderbolt (45:51 - 45:55)
um (45:53 - 45:58)
and since black and white they kept (45:55 - 46:00)
unlimited TMS every game afterward (45:58 - 46:03)
unlimited unlimited unlimited and it was (46:00 - 46:07)
fantastic and then sword and shield came (46:03 - 46:09)
around and they were like (46:07 - 46:13)
we still have unlimited TMS but also we (46:09 - 46:15)
have these TRS (46:13 - 46:18)
and tr's I uh three years ago I (46:15 - 46:20)
complained about tiars I was like why (46:18 - 46:22)
are certain moves not unlimited why do (46:20 - 46:26)
we have to you didn't have to like grind (46:22 - 46:28)
for them per se (46:26 - 46:30)
um you didn't have sorry you didn't have (46:28 - 46:34)
to craft them you had to either do a (46:30 - 46:36)
certain raid to get it to drop or you (46:34 - 46:37)
had to have enough watts and you would (46:36 - 46:39)
talk to the guy and the only reason I (46:37 - 46:42)
wasn't completely negative on TRS is (46:39 - 46:45)
because it replaced like the battle tree (46:42 - 46:48)
where you had to like talk to somebody (46:45 - 46:50)
pay like 200 Battle Points to get like (46:48 - 46:51)
waterfall (46:50 - 46:53)
or whatever (46:51 - 46:55)
um and it was like ah I guess this is (46:53 - 46:56)
better than the battle tree because at (46:55 - 46:59)
least you're holding on to the TR and (46:56 - 47:03)
you could trade TRS versus like I would (46:59 - 47:04)
Greg would have to trade me as Pokemon I (47:03 - 47:06)
would have to go to the battle tree (47:04 - 47:08)
teach it the move and then trade it back (47:06 - 47:10)
for for Greg to get that I was like this (47:08 - 47:12)
is like slightly better so I guess it (47:10 - 47:13)
gets a pass (47:12 - 47:15)
and then a a fantastic game everyone (47:13 - 47:18)
loves this 10 out of 10. brilliant (47:15 - 47:20)
Diamond shining Pro came out and they (47:18 - 47:22)
were like this was that was sarcasm by (47:20 - 47:24)
the way they were like unlimited TMS who (47:22 - 47:27)
is she never heard of her no I don't (47:24 - 47:28)
know her (47:27 - 47:31)
uh you you want TMS uh it was a faithful (47:28 - 47:35)
remake true are you not wrong (47:31 - 47:36)
it was faithful (47:35 - 47:40)
and it was actually one of the comp like (47:36 - 47:42)
one of the downfalls to that game that (47:40 - 47:44)
game would be slightly better if they (47:42 - 47:45)
just if cams were just unlimited (47:44 - 47:49)
slightly slightly very slightly (47:45 - 47:52)
and now they're Throwing It All Out The (47:49 - 47:53)
Window okay and then another game came (47:52 - 47:54)
out (47:53 - 47:56)
Arceus (47:54 - 47:59)
where where they were like you could (47:56 - 48:00)
just talk to this person and teach them (47:59 - 48:03)
moves and if you want money and if you (48:00 - 48:05)
wanted to teach them more moves you had (48:03 - 48:07)
to pay a one-time fee to unlock that (48:05 - 48:09)
move but now you can teach them that (48:07 - 48:10)
move forever (48:09 - 48:12)
which (48:10 - 48:15)
I don't know if that's better per se (48:12 - 48:18)
but it's definitely different like we we (48:15 - 48:20)
have one system that's like unlimited (48:18 - 48:23)
not unlimited and one is significantly (48:20 - 48:25)
better than the other at least Legends (48:23 - 48:27)
was this weird gray area where it was (48:25 - 48:27)
like (48:27 - 48:30)
it was unlimited once you paid for it (48:27 - 48:32)
did you say League of Legends did I miss (48:30 - 48:36)
hear that no Pokemon Legends Arceus (48:32 - 48:39)
Legends unlimited not unlimited one is (48:36 - 48:41)
significantly better and then Legends (48:39 - 48:45)
was it's unlimited once you pay for it (48:41 - 48:48)
and I think that was like ah okay I (48:45 - 48:50)
guess I mean there's not really battles (48:48 - 48:52)
in this game so it's not that big of a (48:50 - 48:54)
deal this game is like nothing is (48:52 - 48:57)
unlimited sorry if you want done to bolt (48:54 - 49:00)
I'm assuming you have to like knock out (48:57 - 49:02)
like a bunch of Pikachu for Pikachu to (49:00 - 49:04)
drop like the Pikachu liver and then I'm (49:02 - 49:07)
like I needed seven Pikachu livers gonna (49:04 - 49:09)
carve the Pikachus (49:07 - 49:12)
like seven Pikachu livers to get like (49:09 - 49:15)
two Thunderbolts yeah (49:12 - 49:19)
yeah that doesn't sound (49:15 - 49:19)
great like why is every game have (49:19 - 49:24)
crafted why do I need to craft (49:22 - 49:26)
something that was just unlimited for (49:24 - 49:28)
how how long has been black and white (49:26 - 49:33)
been out like 12 years uh 11 years (49:28 - 49:36)
am I Am I Wrong Am I just like (49:33 - 49:38)
like (49:36 - 49:40)
cannot imagine (49:38 - 49:42)
going to this is a this is a very (49:40 - 49:44)
specific case (49:42 - 49:46)
but I cannot imagine (49:44 - 49:48)
going to like a a Salt Lake City (49:46 - 49:51)
regionals and being like oh you know (49:48 - 49:53)
what I actually want Vault switch (49:51 - 49:57)
instead of Thunderbolt (49:53 - 49:59)
let me go to the the TM machine and get (49:57 - 50:03)
volt switch here oh I need like (49:59 - 50:07)
I need like five belly bolt Hearts I (50:03 - 50:09)
guess uh let me let like let me go find (50:07 - 50:12)
some belly Bolts real quick and like so (50:09 - 50:14)
you didn't plan ahead (50:12 - 50:16)
okay yeah (50:14 - 50:19)
do you well you did a bunch of (50:16 - 50:21)
tournaments you know the you know the (50:19 - 50:22)
morning of you're changing out two cars (50:21 - 50:25)
in your deck dude that is the worst (50:22 - 50:27)
strategy in the world I also have to say (50:25 - 50:30)
that if you are on a hunt with me (50:27 - 50:34)
and you choose to cap instead of kill (50:30 - 50:37)
I will report you (50:34 - 50:37)
and I will report you don't you can't (50:37 - 50:43)
capture okay I need a capture to have (50:41 - 50:45)
friends isn't that the point of the game (50:43 - 50:47)
no you have the option to either capture (50:45 - 50:50)
or kill and I always kill oh we're (50:47 - 50:53)
talking about starter (50:50 - 50:53)
I don't okay (50:53 - 50:58)
okay I find I find a couple of things (50:55 - 51:00)
about this press release (50:58 - 51:02)
problematic one a crafting system I (51:00 - 51:04)
don't like crafting system in these (51:02 - 51:06)
games I it had better not come with an (51:04 - 51:08)
inventory issue problem because if that (51:06 - 51:10)
bag is not unlimited and I can't carry (51:08 - 51:11)
17 (51:10 - 51:14)
fart blossoms then we're gonna have an (51:11 - 51:17)
issue for me to make whatever move it (51:14 - 51:19)
makes two (51:17 - 51:21)
oh (51:19 - 51:23)
the selection of TMS available to make (51:21 - 51:25)
grows as players continue their (51:23 - 51:28)
Adventure which plot line (51:25 - 51:30)
what part of the adventure do I grow do (51:28 - 51:33)
I grow to get more TMS which part I'm I (51:30 - 51:36)
I would have to grow I am assuming it is (51:33 - 51:39)
clearly Gym Leaders some NPC will tell (51:36 - 51:41)
you it has to be Gym Leaders right which (51:39 - 51:43)
means again the only important plot line (51:41 - 51:47)
to to progress into the game which is (51:43 - 51:48)
probably also going to be the important (51:47 - 51:50)
plot line to raise the level of wild (51:48 - 51:54)
Pokemon is the gym challenge (51:50 - 51:57)
yeah I think so too that's it's annoying (51:54 - 51:59)
it's dumb and I hate that they tie (51:57 - 52:01)
things like I also hate that the fact (51:59 - 52:02)
that it's a crafting mechanic I don't (52:01 - 52:06)
they crafting is pointless either it is (52:02 - 52:09)
an unnecessary amount of stress early on (52:06 - 52:11)
in the game or later in the game which (52:09 - 52:13)
has happened in Arceus you are (52:11 - 52:15)
overflowing with stuff and you're like I (52:13 - 52:17)
don't even want to bother I will just go (52:15 - 52:18)
buy it from the guy that sells it (52:17 - 52:21)
because I had to throw away 17 things in (52:18 - 52:23)
my bag and the first thing to go are the (52:21 - 52:25)
useless items that are literally (52:23 - 52:26)
everywhere (52:25 - 52:28)
and I don't need them to make balls (52:26 - 52:31)
anymore because the guy sells them and I (52:28 - 52:35)
have money that is spent on nothing else (52:31 - 52:35)
yeah (52:36 - 52:41)
the crafting idea is bad it is always (52:38 - 52:43)
bad and I've yet to see it implemented (52:41 - 52:45)
in a Pokemon game where I thought well (52:43 - 52:47)
this was fun (52:45 - 52:47)
I don't know if you only have to craft (52:49 - 52:52)
it once and then you just use LPS to (52:50 - 52:54)
purchase future (52:52 - 52:59)
maybe maybe but where do LPS come from (52:54 - 53:00)
um LPS can be obtained as the players (52:59 - 53:01)
Advance the story or by trading (53:00 - 53:04)
materials from Pokemon (53:01 - 53:04)
hate relationship with crafting I think (53:07 - 53:11)
that there are some instances yeah I (53:09 - 53:13)
just have a hate I think there are some (53:11 - 53:16)
instances that crafting is is great (53:13 - 53:17)
um obviously there are a lot of there (53:16 - 53:18)
are a lot of games out there where (53:17 - 53:20)
crafting is is very popular and those (53:18 - 53:22)
games are very popular (53:20 - 53:23)
um I don't think every game needs (53:22 - 53:26)
crafting but I I also like I get the (53:23 - 53:28)
impression that this is like (53:26 - 53:31)
well we need to figure out some sort of (53:28 - 53:33)
loop for our players to do to keep (53:31 - 53:36)
playing the game and we need we need a (53:33 - 53:38)
reason for players to attack or battle (53:36 - 53:40)
wild Pokemon (53:38 - 53:42)
and they're going to battle them to drop (53:40 - 53:44)
items and then you're going to use those (53:42 - 53:48)
items to cash in for TMS but that Loop (53:44 - 53:50)
kind of goes away (53:48 - 53:54)
when you think about like (53:50 - 53:54)
what are you building teams for like if (53:55 - 53:59)
you're if you're if you're an average (53:58 - 54:01)
player and you're going through (53:59 - 54:04)
and you're you're beating the Elite Four (54:01 - 54:08)
and you're battling team star and (54:04 - 54:11)
um you're doing raids like that's that's (54:08 - 54:13)
not (54:11 - 54:15)
I don't think you're gonna need like (54:13 - 54:17)
eight Thunderbolts to do that (54:15 - 54:20)
unless you really like electric Pokemon (54:17 - 54:22)
um (54:20 - 54:25)
like like it seems like to me an average (54:22 - 54:27)
player who maybe puts like (54:25 - 54:30)
200 hours into a game probably only (54:27 - 54:33)
needs one and or two of every TM maybe (54:30 - 54:35)
maybe three or four if there's like a (54:33 - 54:36)
specific if they love Ice Beam or (54:35 - 54:39)
something oh yeah I never use TMs like (54:36 - 54:41)
it would be amazing for me to choose to (54:39 - 54:43)
put a TM on one of my Pokemon (54:41 - 54:48)
but if you're a competitive player or a (54:43 - 54:50)
player that just likes the battle or or (54:48 - 54:52)
or or do ranked and you're you're (54:50 - 54:54)
constantly trying new teams and you're (54:52 - 54:58)
constantly changing team like teams (54:54 - 54:58)
you're asking that player to do a bunch (54:59 - 55:04)
of busy work just so they can do the (55:02 - 55:06)
part of the game that they enjoy (55:04 - 55:08)
and I do think the tournament thing is (55:06 - 55:11)
is a pretty good and real example I was (55:08 - 55:16)
in a uh again this is probably very uh (55:11 - 55:18)
specific to me but just quick story I (55:16 - 55:20)
was in a I was in a uh a YouTuber (55:18 - 55:23)
tournament or whatever there was like 24 (55:20 - 55:25)
YouTubers you're supposed to do eight (55:23 - 55:28)
different battles a week uh or sorry (55:25 - 55:29)
eight battle one battle a week eight (55:28 - 55:31)
weeks every every week you're supposed (55:29 - 55:33)
to have a different team (55:31 - 55:36)
and uh (55:33 - 55:38)
and and to be quite Frank and to be (55:36 - 55:41)
quite honest every single YouTuber just (55:38 - 55:44)
used some sort of Bot or PK hex to make (55:41 - 55:45)
their teams because they could make (55:44 - 55:49)
their teams in seconds to participate in (55:45 - 55:52)
a one-off tournament match (55:49 - 55:54)
and then they were never going to use (55:52 - 55:55)
that team again (55:54 - 55:59)
to be I understand why they did it (55:55 - 56:02)
I didn't I was like people were shocked (55:59 - 56:04)
because they would see me building the (56:02 - 56:05)
team on stream every week and they were (56:04 - 56:08)
like oh you're actually making the teams (56:05 - 56:10)
and I was like yeah I built eight (56:08 - 56:13)
completely different teams six times (56:10 - 56:16)
eight whatever that is where I was (56:13 - 56:18)
changing abilities I was changing moves (56:16 - 56:21)
I was changing IV and Eevee spreads I (56:18 - 56:23)
was changing nature and the only reason (56:21 - 56:27)
I was able to do that was because I had (56:23 - 56:30)
2 000 hours in the game where I would (56:27 - 56:33)
where I would pick up feathers I would I (56:30 - 56:35)
would do so many raids that I would be (56:33 - 56:37)
just swimming in nuggets or pearls or (56:35 - 56:40)
whatever else I could sell (56:37 - 56:43)
um I would try not to use vitamins and I (56:40 - 56:45)
would try just the EV train the (56:43 - 56:46)
old-fashioned way because I was also (56:45 - 56:48)
like two birds one stone we'll lock out (56:46 - 56:51)
rookie D's for Speed EVS but I'll also (56:48 - 56:53)
try to hunt for a shiny rookie D like (56:51 - 56:56)
literally at the end of that eight weeks (56:53 - 56:58)
I had nothing left I had no more (56:56 - 57:01)
vitamins I was I had no more feathers I (56:58 - 57:03)
I had no like I ran out of nuggets and (57:01 - 57:05)
Pearls to cash in (57:03 - 57:08)
and the only reason I was able to do (57:05 - 57:10)
eight different teams in eight different (57:08 - 57:13)
weeks was because I put so many hours (57:10 - 57:16)
prior to that into this game to make (57:13 - 57:17)
that happen (57:16 - 57:19)
and so to introduce (57:17 - 57:22)
a crafting system (57:19 - 57:25)
for a (57:22 - 57:28)
set of items that should ultimately be a (57:25 - 57:30)
lower barrier of entry for people who (57:28 - 57:32)
want to like the people who are going to (57:30 - 57:34)
change their TMS or the people that are (57:32 - 57:36)
like they just want to get into battles (57:34 - 57:37)
and do that like they don't want to (57:36 - 57:39)
knock out wiglets for two hours and hope (57:37 - 57:41)
they have enough materials to get like (57:39 - 57:43)
Earth I don't know if Wiggly gets (57:41 - 57:45)
earthquake but (57:43 - 57:48)
like it's almost like we need to put we (57:45 - 57:51)
need crafting where are we gonna put it (57:48 - 57:55)
not here put it somewhere else why why (57:51 - 57:57)
isn't crafting for pokeballs (57:55 - 57:59)
but don't don't don't don't don't don't (57:57 - 58:02)
don't start us there (57:59 - 58:04)
I also feel like the crafting came (58:02 - 58:06)
because they wanted to have some extra (58:04 - 58:09)
thing for when you sent your Pokemon on (58:06 - 58:12)
it's let's go Journey that it was coming (58:09 - 58:14)
back with things that you wanted and (58:12 - 58:15)
they're like well it has to come back (58:14 - 58:17)
with something other than experience and (58:15 - 58:18)
what are we going to do with those (58:17 - 58:21)
things oh let's have them make TMS (58:18 - 58:23)
like you'll be over here sniffing this (58:21 - 58:27)
flower and your Pokemon's battling its (58:23 - 58:29)
heart out Gathering materials for you it (58:27 - 58:31)
just feels (58:29 - 58:34)
it feels like the idea for the mechanic (58:31 - 58:35)
came first and then they just tried to (58:34 - 58:39)
wedge it in somehow which is also why I (58:35 - 58:40)
don't particularly like I mean it was (58:39 - 58:42)
either going to be TMS or sandwiches (58:40 - 58:45)
yeah so take your pick take your pick I (58:42 - 58:46)
guess (58:45 - 58:48)
I I don't know I just the fact that they (58:46 - 58:49)
flaunted this as like a brand new (58:48 - 58:51)
feature it was like this is like three (58:49 - 58:53)
steps backwards like this is not a new (58:51 - 58:56)
feature this is we had this great thing (58:53 - 58:58)
that we're now applying busy work to and (58:56 - 59:01)
you know maybe when it comes out it's (58:58 - 59:06)
not that bad (59:01 - 59:06)
but if if somebody wants to (59:06 - 59:12)
like boot up the game and just play (59:09 - 59:15)
competitive Pokemon and make and I I do (59:12 - 59:15)
know a lot of competitive Pokemon (59:15 - 59:17)
players that they they do play through (59:15 - 59:18)
the story (59:17 - 59:20)
because they want to see it out and then (59:18 - 59:22)
they're done they don't want a shiny (59:20 - 59:24)
hunt they don't want to make sandwiches (59:22 - 59:25)
they don't want to complete the Pokedex (59:24 - 59:28)
they do want to experience the story and (59:25 - 59:30)
then they want to battle their hearts (59:28 - 59:32)
out and that's a very valid way to play (59:30 - 59:33)
look if you don't care about battling (59:32 - 59:35)
you don't care about stories but you (59:33 - 59:36)
just want to make sandwiches for the (59:35 - 59:38)
rest of your life also a valid way to (59:36 - 59:40)
play if if you want to just complete the (59:38 - 59:44)
Pokedex the shiny hunt valid way to play (59:40 - 59:44)
um (59:44 - 59:49)
but if if I want to just battle my heart (59:45 - 59:51)
out why do I have to do like three hours (59:49 - 59:53)
of Wiglet battling in order to get (59:51 - 59:56)
everything I need to do (59:53 - 60:00)
uh maybe I don't know it just it just (59:56 - 60:02)
seems (60:00 - 60:05)
just seems very backwards (60:02 - 60:05)
break though uh because there's another (60:06 - 60:10)
trailer (60:08 - 60:11)
um (60:10 - 60:13)
and Greg can be negative because (60:11 - 60:14)
apparently he doesn't like that Pokemon (60:13 - 60:17)
but I I think (60:14 - 60:17)
we're ready I think he's great we will (60:18 - 60:23)
be right back (60:21 - 60:27)
and we are back (60:23 - 60:30)
uh so there was another announcement (60:27 - 60:33)
well this is a little confusing there (60:30 - 60:34)
was an announcement (60:33 - 60:37)
for an announcement (60:34 - 60:39)
and that announcement made another (60:37 - 60:41)
announcement (60:39 - 60:41)
and there was there was a lot happening (60:42 - 60:45)
there (60:44 - 60:47)
I mean there were three videos that you (60:45 - 60:49)
could watch is what that translates to (60:47 - 60:53)
Yes uh so uh this is off the press (60:49 - 60:54)
release the Pokemon company (60:53 - 60:56)
International and Nintendo have revealed (60:54 - 60:59)
a shocking new trainer and Pokemon Duo (60:56 - 61:02)
gym leader iono and partner belly bolt (60:59 - 61:04)
found in the paldero region of Pokemon (61:02 - 61:07)
scarlet and Pokemon Violet video games (61:04 - 61:12)
uh I'm gonna say I own iono because the (61:07 - 61:16)
i in Japanese makes the e sound (61:12 - 61:20)
and she is a Japanese character like she (61:16 - 61:22)
she speaks Japanese in the English like (61:20 - 61:25)
that she's just I'm that's just what she (61:22 - 61:28)
like is right like (61:25 - 61:28)
I mean in Japanese there's no Japan in (61:28 - 61:37)
the Pokemon world so (61:34 - 61:40)
she's from another region that speaks (61:37 - 61:41)
Japanese maybe (61:40 - 61:44)
yeah I mean like Lieutenant Serge is (61:41 - 61:49)
American in Santa which I think they've (61:44 - 61:52)
backed off on yeah well you know what's (61:49 - 61:53)
weird exists I don't know if we talked (61:52 - 61:55)
about this on the podcast but when when (61:53 - 61:56)
they showed wigglet (61:55 - 62:00)
they had like a whole website and like (61:56 - 62:02)
trailer for that that they never showed (62:00 - 62:04)
anywhere outside of Japan (62:02 - 62:07)
right it was just it was a website it (62:04 - 62:09)
was a website you could go to (62:07 - 62:12)
and it was a fake Zoom call and there (62:09 - 62:14)
were view the the zoom call was like a (62:12 - 62:16)
bunch of researchers looking at these (62:14 - 62:19)
new Pokemon and they they find Wiglet at (62:16 - 62:20)
the end of it right it's I think it's (62:19 - 62:23)
like nine minutes long and the the five (62:20 - 62:25)
people in part of this fake Zoom call (62:23 - 62:28)
one is Un-American speaking English one (62:25 - 62:30)
is somebody speaking Spanish and then (62:28 - 62:32)
somebody's speaking Japanese and then I (62:30 - 62:35)
think somebody speaking German (62:32 - 62:38)
and it was only shown in Japan even (62:35 - 62:39)
though it was a bunch of different (62:38 - 62:41)
languages and even though it was (62:39 - 62:44)
subtitled in English (62:41 - 62:46)
they were like no we're just that's not (62:44 - 62:48)
coming to America in any way (62:46 - 62:52)
well what you're saying right now is the (62:48 - 62:53)
same thing as those people who said (62:52 - 62:55)
nobody who's gonna tell the Japanese (62:53 - 62:57)
right (62:55 - 63:00)
they knew we would find it (62:57 - 63:03)
yeah but just put up pokemon.com like (63:00 - 63:05)
look at this fake Zoom call (63:03 - 63:09)
um and then this is like all in Japanese (63:05 - 63:11)
and this was okay (63:09 - 63:13)
uh again English what what like I'm not (63:11 - 63:15)
complaining that was in Japanese I I (63:13 - 63:18)
thought everything about this was great (63:15 - 63:23)
I like the concept of (63:18 - 63:27)
a content creator streamer (63:23 - 63:32)
personality coming on uh a YouTube video (63:27 - 63:34)
to say that she's announcing something (63:32 - 63:37)
else I think that was like really clever (63:34 - 63:40)
and really great because it's what you (63:37 - 63:40)
problem that a lot of people had with it (63:46 - 63:53)
was Nintendo slash the Pokemon company (63:49 - 63:54)
uh (63:53 - 63:57)
they were like hey there's an (63:54 - 64:00)
announcement at 6 a.m Pacific Time 8 A.M (63:57 - 64:03)
Central Time set your clocks and so they (64:00 - 64:06)
hyped up people (64:03 - 64:08)
for an announcement that was that was (64:06 - 64:11)
the the big announcements coming in two (64:08 - 64:14)
days right where like I don't and they (64:11 - 64:17)
were also late yeah they were not on the (64:14 - 64:19)
dot where like I don't understand why (64:17 - 64:22)
that needed to be done like they could (64:19 - 64:23)
have just dropped this trailer at like (64:22 - 64:26)
12 o'clock in the afternoon with no hype (64:23 - 64:27)
up people would have saw it and then (64:26 - 64:28)
people would have the word of mouth (64:27 - 64:30)
would have right then been like okay in (64:28 - 64:31)
two days there's something even bigger (64:30 - 64:33)
right because I think they did it right (64:31 - 64:36)
when they did uh who Zoe zui and Zoro (64:33 - 64:38)
are killing that dude (64:36 - 64:40)
that was good because you just watched a (64:38 - 64:42)
guy get wrecked and they're like what (64:40 - 64:43)
killed that guy and then two days later (64:42 - 64:46)
like oh that killed that guy cool for (64:43 - 64:49)
Legends Arceus yeah yeah to me this is (64:46 - 64:52)
the same thing as those streamers who (64:49 - 64:55)
like post on all the social media and (64:52 - 64:57)
push out to Twitch like I'm going live (64:55 - 65:00)
and then you sit and they have a little (64:57 - 65:03)
purple screen that says starting soon (65:00 - 65:07)
for 15 minutes (65:03 - 65:07)
what I'm not watching it it's like (65:12 - 65:16)
watching it was like watching the (65:14 - 65:18)
minutos who have been set up there and (65:16 - 65:19)
just stare at you (65:18 - 65:23)
not giving me trivia just eating M M's (65:19 - 65:26)
and staring at you for 15 minutes like I (65:23 - 65:29)
come from a theater background you start (65:26 - 65:32)
the show you maybe hold it 10 minutes if (65:29 - 65:34)
the weather is bad but a house lights (65:32 - 65:37)
down the show starts we gotta get out of (65:34 - 65:39)
there in the allotted time these people (65:37 - 65:43)
are old and need to get home (65:39 - 65:43)
everybody you're putting way too much (65:48 - 65:52)
credit on the audience for arriving on (65:50 - 65:53)
time (65:52 - 65:56)
that's their problem the show starts at (65:53 - 65:58)
eight o'clock the show starts at eight (65:56 - 66:00)
o'clock it's an eight o'clock curtain if (65:58 - 66:04)
the actors had to be there and in places (66:00 - 66:08)
everybody else needs to be there (66:04 - 66:08)
I was just double checking that I was (66:09 - 66:11)
recording (66:10 - 66:13)
um (66:11 - 66:16)
it says iono is the gym leader of the (66:13 - 66:19)
lavencia uh I don't know uh one of the (66:16 - 66:21)
the paldeo Region's prominent cities (66:19 - 66:22)
specializes in electric type Pokemon (66:21 - 66:25)
she's also known as The Supercharged (66:22 - 66:27)
streamer having gained popularity online (66:25 - 66:29)
as the host of a show called The eono (66:27 - 66:30)
Zone (66:29 - 66:32)
um and then she eventually she does like (66:30 - 66:34)
this like quiz of like oh this Pokemon (66:32 - 66:36)
is squishy and this Pokemon is tall and (66:34 - 66:37)
this Pokemon's electric and then you're (66:36 - 66:38)
supposed to be able you're supposed to (66:37 - 66:40)
like guess it but obviously it's a new (66:38 - 66:43)
Pokemon so it'd be impossible to guess (66:40 - 66:45)
it ends up being a Pokemon called belly (66:43 - 66:49)
bolt belly boat belly bolt expands and (66:45 - 66:51)
contracts its elastic body to generate (66:49 - 66:52)
electricity in an organ that looks like (66:51 - 66:54)
a belly button the huge amount of (66:52 - 66:56)
electricity generated this way when (66:54 - 66:58)
discharged from the two bumps on either (66:56 - 67:01)
side of its head resemble eyeballs its (66:58 - 67:04)
actual eyes are adorably round and small (67:01 - 67:07)
belly bolts ability electromorphosis is (67:04 - 67:09)
appearing for the first time in scarlet (67:07 - 67:12)
and violet when belly bolt becomes belly (67:09 - 67:14)
bolt will become charged when hit by an (67:12 - 67:17)
attack boosting the power of the next (67:14 - 67:20)
electric type move it uses (67:17 - 67:23)
uh it is known as the elect the Ellie (67:20 - 67:25)
frog Pokemon electric type ability (67:23 - 67:28)
electromorphosis and static iono and (67:25 - 67:31)
belly bolt appear uh for the first time (67:28 - 67:32)
in these games and that that was pretty (67:31 - 67:34)
much the press release there were there (67:32 - 67:35)
were three trailers there was the first (67:34 - 67:36)
trailer which was the announcement for (67:35 - 67:38)
the announcement the second trailer was (67:36 - 67:40)
her revealing belly bolt and then the (67:38 - 67:42)
third trailer was just like some in-game (67:40 - 67:46)
footage of belly bolt moving around (67:42 - 67:48)
I will say it was pretty jarring going (67:46 - 67:50)
from like the first two trailers where (67:48 - 67:52)
she's speaking Japanese and she's like (67:50 - 67:55)
very excited to the third trailer where (67:52 - 67:55)
like (67:55 - 67:58)
she sends belly bolt out in battle and (67:55 - 68:00)
it's like completely like silent except (67:58 - 68:01)
for the music and the text so it was (68:00 - 68:04)
like very jarring yeah no voice acting (68:01 - 68:06)
in this game nah (68:04 - 68:09)
I feel (68:06 - 68:09)
like you made a lot out of this gym (68:10 - 68:16)
leader for literally (68:12 - 68:19)
potentially no like I hope they are (68:16 - 68:21)
going to do more with these Gym Leaders (68:19 - 68:22)
than you show up and battle them and (68:21 - 68:24)
then you never see them again (68:22 - 68:27)
other than them going into Masters but I (68:24 - 68:29)
have a strong position you're just gonna (68:27 - 68:31)
go there battle them and they'll have a (68:29 - 68:32)
little task and then you'll be like cool (68:31 - 68:34)
I'm out and I will never hear from you (68:32 - 68:37)
again it could be like Kalos where they (68:34 - 68:39)
had the 3D news announcer that everybody (68:37 - 68:42)
ignored constantly (68:39 - 68:42)
um yeah (68:43 - 68:45)
do we think that the Magnemite on her (68:47 - 68:53)
head are pounding palday and Magnemite (68:49 - 68:54)
you just think we just think they're (68:53 - 68:56)
different colored they're just different (68:54 - 68:58)
colors well she said they're not they're (68:56 - 69:01)
not Magnemite rights yeah but they can (68:58 - 69:03)
be based off the real things (69:01 - 69:05)
they are they're just painted colors (69:03 - 69:09)
it's like saying I had a drawing of my (69:05 - 69:12)
cat I had to change the colors so now it (69:09 - 69:14)
is a completely different cat no it's (69:12 - 69:15)
the same cat you just painted it (69:14 - 69:17)
differently (69:15 - 69:17)
okay (69:18 - 69:21)
Magnemite hasn't had a new form yet it's (69:22 - 69:27)
got three it's all it needs it's a bad (69:25 - 69:29)
Pokemon (69:27 - 69:31)
like like you know Diglett has had a (69:29 - 69:33)
lowland Diglett and you know saying (69:31 - 69:37)
alolan sand slash alone Vulpix (69:33 - 69:41)
it's possible not needed (69:37 - 69:41)
um (69:43 - 69:47)
and Greg you you dislike belly bolt I do (69:44 - 69:49)
not like Billy Bob (69:47 - 69:52)
okay so you normally don't like Pokemon (69:49 - 69:54)
that are like Magnemite or meltan like (69:52 - 69:56)
the mechanical Pokemon this this is just (69:54 - 69:58)
a big frog what's what's the problem (69:56 - 70:00)
here it's not a big frog it is a Big (69:58 - 70:03)
Blob of nothing it is as a friend of (70:00 - 70:04)
mine put it grease lightning Grimace (70:03 - 70:06)
which made me laugh very hard the only (70:04 - 70:08)
way that I've been able to tolerate this (70:06 - 70:11)
thing I do not like that it's eyes on (70:08 - 70:13)
the side are fake and then his eyes in (70:11 - 70:15)
the middle are normal it's got the weird (70:13 - 70:18)
Nick Jr face face on it it also it's (70:15 - 70:19)
like (70:18 - 70:21)
at this point just call it pal day and (70:19 - 70:23)
Chancey because that's what it looks (70:21 - 70:25)
like and I'm not a huge fan it looks (70:23 - 70:27)
like chancy it kind of looks like a a (70:25 - 70:29)
squishier palpitode like it doesn't (70:27 - 70:31)
really look like Chansey at all it's the (70:29 - 70:33)
same shape as Chansey it's got a big (70:31 - 70:35)
thing in its belly metal development it (70:33 - 70:38)
looks looks like it's lit it's an egg it (70:35 - 70:40)
looks like Chansey instead of having the (70:38 - 70:42)
Frills on the side it's got eyeballs it (70:40 - 70:45)
is weird pal day and Chansey and I'm not (70:42 - 70:47)
a huge fan of Chansey either (70:45 - 70:49)
I don't know it (70:47 - 70:51)
it's one of the things that like people (70:49 - 70:52)
like oh you'll like it better when you (70:51 - 70:53)
see it and I watch the trailer and I'm (70:52 - 70:57)
like I like it worse it is that it's (70:53 - 70:59)
just not it is not a design that I care (70:57 - 71:01)
for (70:59 - 71:07)
um it it just feels really amorphous and (71:01 - 71:07)
it's just too blah well I mean to say (71:09 - 71:14)
the the reason that it looks like (71:12 - 71:16)
Chansey is because they did the let's (71:14 - 71:20)
draw an oval let's draw a circle let's (71:16 - 71:24)
draw another Circle okay done done (71:20 - 71:26)
I mean I I think there's a lot of value (71:24 - 71:28)
in the Simplicity of certain Pokemon (71:26 - 71:30)
designs and there's a lot of values in (71:28 - 71:32)
the complexity of other Pokemon designs (71:30 - 71:35)
there is when I saw this Pokemon (71:32 - 71:37)
I was like oh somebody at the Pokemon (71:35 - 71:38)
company like discovered what (71:37 - 71:40)
squishmallows were and they were like we (71:38 - 71:42)
need a Pokemon that's my other joke that (71:40 - 71:43)
the squish metal partnership has gotten (71:42 - 71:46)
too far uh that did that did good (71:43 - 71:48)
numbers and slack like there there (71:46 - 71:50)
there's no (71:48 - 71:52)
it I I would be shocked (71:50 - 71:55)
if one this Pokemon doesn't become a (71:52 - 71:56)
squish mellow we know that there are two (71:55 - 71:59)
squishmallows coming I would be shocked (71:56 - 72:01)
if this Pokemon doesn't have at least (71:59 - 72:02)
two different plushes that are not (72:01 - 72:04)
squish mellow related I would also be (72:02 - 72:06)
incredibly shocked if this Pokemon isn't (72:04 - 72:09)
one of those like stress balls (72:06 - 72:11)
that they put on Pokemon Center or the (72:09 - 72:12)
Japanese Pokemon Center where you like (72:11 - 72:14)
squeeze it and it's like eyes pop out or (72:12 - 72:15)
whatever like (72:14 - 72:17)
like (72:15 - 72:19)
you know when they make a Pokemon like (72:17 - 72:21)
Lucario or like zorark and they're like (72:19 - 72:24)
this is this is the marketing machine or (72:21 - 72:26)
like they make uh you know they got a (72:24 - 72:27)
lot of reason (72:26 - 72:29)
this has never been confirmed but I feel (72:27 - 72:30)
like (72:29 - 72:32)
a lot of the reasons why starter Pokemon (72:30 - 72:34)
don't evolve in the anime is because (72:32 - 72:36)
it's easier to sell the base Evolution (72:34 - 72:39)
plushes so if a kid is constantly seeing (72:36 - 72:41)
like a like a (72:39 - 72:44)
uh like a Mudkip like Mudkip plushes (72:41 - 72:47)
just continue to sell better than you (72:44 - 72:49)
know no one's out there buying (72:47 - 72:52)
Marsha Marsh Tom plushes or whatever (72:49 - 72:54)
but like I feel like this Pokemon is (72:52 - 72:57)
like oh like we can make a lot of (72:54 - 72:58)
different (72:57 - 73:00)
squish mellow like things because that's (72:58 - 73:02)
hot right now that's not to say like (73:00 - 73:04)
that makes the Pokemon bad I I think (73:02 - 73:07)
it's cute like I like how squishy it is (73:04 - 73:09)
but like I don't (73:07 - 73:11)
I don't like love it I just think it's (73:09 - 73:12)
like oh yeah that's a cute Pokemon like (73:11 - 73:17)
move on uh I am curious if this is uh it (73:12 - 73:20)
doesn't give me (73:17 - 73:21)
I compared it to Dreadnought it doesn't (73:20 - 73:23)
give me Dreadnought Vibes where there's (73:21 - 73:26)
like a pre-evolution but it also doesn't (73:23 - 73:28)
give me like (73:26 - 73:30)
komala Vibes where like it doesn't (73:28 - 73:33)
evolve at all like I can't tell like it (73:30 - 73:37)
really screams middle Evolution to me (73:33 - 73:39)
but I don't know no I I think it's just (73:37 - 73:41)
I don't know that it's going to evolve I (73:39 - 73:43)
think it just is (73:41 - 73:44)
yeah I think so and especially because (73:43 - 73:48)
it has that unique ability the new (73:44 - 73:51)
ability that like I think they just kind (73:48 - 73:55)
of stuck it on this one as a solo (73:51 - 73:57)
oh you think because it's Unique it's (73:55 - 74:00)
just never gonna evolve yeah I have a (73:57 - 74:03)
feeling like later games it will get its (74:00 - 74:05)
baby form and then it's that it's (74:03 - 74:06)
Blissey form let's say (74:05 - 74:08)
but I think this is just a one and it's (74:06 - 74:12)
this is a one and done for this game (74:08 - 74:14)
I don't know like it's saying that it (74:12 - 74:18)
gets hit by any move uh yeah that it (74:14 - 74:20)
boosts but only the next turn so I would (74:18 - 74:21)
assume that like (74:20 - 74:24)
if you got hit by a move (74:21 - 74:28)
your next turn it your boosted (74:24 - 74:30)
but if you were to like protect (74:28 - 74:32)
the turn after it goes back to normal (74:30 - 74:35)
yeah I would I would say that that's (74:32 - 74:37)
true yes it's not like you're boosted (74:35 - 74:39)
until the next time and it says boosting (74:37 - 74:41)
the power of your next electric type (74:39 - 74:43)
move yeah it seems like very easy to (74:41 - 74:45)
counter right like you you hit it it's (74:43 - 74:47)
electric type boot move is boosted (74:45 - 74:48)
they're about to use it you just switch (74:47 - 74:51)
into like a grand Pokemon or protect or (74:48 - 74:52)
yeah you protect yeah (74:51 - 74:55)
yeah is that a particularly (74:52 - 74:57)
interesting (74:55 - 75:00)
mechanic like since you know that it's (74:57 - 75:03)
going to be the next one the question of (75:00 - 75:04)
course is if it's slow (75:03 - 75:07)
and you hit it does it immediately boost (75:04 - 75:10)
like is it the next turn or does the (75:07 - 75:13)
Boost immediately apply it does say next (75:10 - 75:17)
to I think it's getting hit (75:13 - 75:17)
there's no way it's fast right it's like (75:17 - 75:21)
you'd like to see it move around in the (75:20 - 75:22)
game like there's this probably has like (75:21 - 75:24)
a base speed of like 30 or something (75:22 - 75:26)
yeah because it says boosting the power (75:24 - 75:29)
of the next electric type move it uses (75:26 - 75:31)
it doesn't say next turn you're right it (75:29 - 75:34)
says the next electric type move it uses (75:31 - 75:38)
so if it's slow it gets hit and you've (75:34 - 75:40)
selected thunderboat (75:38 - 75:43)
I'm assuming it boosts that Thunderbolt (75:40 - 75:46)
I mean that turn so it (75:43 - 75:50)
it is at least somewhat dynamic in that (75:46 - 75:53)
way it being slower is better right I (75:50 - 75:55)
and I think that so if it was like if it (75:53 - 75:56)
was like a base speed of 60 that's (75:55 - 75:59)
probably even worse for it yeah I think (75:56 - 76:01)
it I think it's I think it's slow and (75:59 - 76:03)
bulky but doesn't have a lot of power (76:01 - 76:05)
relying on the fact that you are it's (76:03 - 76:07)
power is expected to be boosted once you (76:05 - 76:09)
get hit well yeah so you set up trick (76:07 - 76:11)
room and then you have it go out with (76:09 - 76:15)
whimsicott and have whimsicott (76:11 - 76:17)
slap it on the back (76:15 - 76:21)
and then it attacks (76:17 - 76:21)
I I like Yono I I think she's great I (76:24 - 76:29)
think like all (76:27 - 76:32)
I I I think for the last several Pokemon (76:29 - 76:34)
games they've really knocked gym leaders (76:32 - 76:36)
and characters out of the park (76:34 - 76:37)
um (76:36 - 76:41)
sword and shield uh Legends (76:37 - 76:42)
this game (76:41 - 76:44)
sun and moon for the better at making (76:42 - 76:47)
very memorable characters I I still (76:44 - 76:50)
don't think they make them particularly (76:47 - 76:52)
memorable in game (76:50 - 76:56)
yeah 100 like their design is great (76:52 - 76:58)
their designs are very they're getting (76:56 - 77:01)
more creative and more modern with their (76:58 - 77:03)
design like they are (77:01 - 77:06)
more willing to make things feel like (77:03 - 77:08)
they're in a time period than they I (77:06 - 77:10)
think they have been and they're like (77:08 - 77:13)
you know fine let's give a character (77:10 - 77:16)
gigantic boots that make no sense (77:13 - 77:20)
cool let's give this character hair that (77:16 - 77:23)
doesn't make any sense let's give this (77:20 - 77:26)
guy a thorn whip like let's let's do (77:23 - 77:28)
just some wild things and I think it (77:26 - 77:31)
makes the memorable my problem is is (77:28 - 77:33)
like (77:31 - 77:35)
they don't become much of anything (77:33 - 77:39)
post-game right yeah like no I agree (77:35 - 77:40)
I mean you look at it you look at I (77:39 - 77:42)
think the character that comes to mind (77:40 - 77:45)
the most is Grant from X and Y which is (77:42 - 77:47)
the second gym leader he has an Amor (77:45 - 77:50)
Amora and a Tyrunt as his Pokemon two (77:47 - 77:53)
brand new Pokemon two fossil Pokemon (77:50 - 77:55)
um a kind of a difficult fight if if you (77:53 - 77:57)
don't have like a water Pokemon or (77:55 - 77:58)
you're just unsure of like what these (77:57 - 78:00)
Pokemon do but like (77:58 - 78:02)
his (78:00 - 78:05)
personality is that they're a rock (78:02 - 78:08)
climber and that's cool that's like new (78:05 - 78:09)
that's like the first time I have I have (78:08 - 78:11)
a bunch of carabiners and stuff you know (78:09 - 78:13)
we love a carabiner (78:11 - 78:16)
um their gym is great uh it's a cool (78:13 - 78:18)
little like puzzle (78:16 - 78:20)
you never see that that character again (78:18 - 78:23)
just done just there's there's no (78:20 - 78:25)
there's nothing before that and there's (78:23 - 78:27)
nothing after that you get to their town (78:25 - 78:30)
you ride your bike up the Little (78:27 - 78:32)
Mountain you go into the gym you climb (78:30 - 78:34)
the Little Rock Climbing puzzle which is (78:32 - 78:35)
like a very cute puzzle it's not (78:34 - 78:37)
obviously not difficult but I think that (78:35 - 78:39)
puzzle in itself is pretty memorable (78:37 - 78:41)
um and then you fight them and then (78:39 - 78:44)
never again just see you later (78:41 - 78:46)
uh like they put it feels like they put (78:44 - 78:48)
so much work in like there there must be (78:46 - 78:50)
like a character designer or something (78:48 - 78:52)
on the team and they're like spending (78:50 - 78:53)
their heart and soul in these characters (78:52 - 78:55)
and then they give it over to like the (78:53 - 78:56)
game programmer and they're like well (78:55 - 78:58)
you know we're out of time so we're out (78:56 - 79:01)
of time so they get five minutes (78:58 - 79:01)
I think that's why people connect with (79:02 - 79:05)
black and white though because (79:03 - 79:07)
um (79:05 - 79:10)
it felt like throughout that game gym (79:07 - 79:12)
leaders were popping up again and and (79:10 - 79:14)
kind of like stopping you or or people (79:12 - 79:15)
were talking about gym leaders and then (79:14 - 79:17)
there's that big scene at the end of (79:15 - 79:18)
black and white where they all show up (79:17 - 79:19)
and you're like oh yeah all of you exist (79:18 - 79:23)
well they were part of the world yes (79:19 - 79:23)
so (79:24 - 79:26)
um (79:25 - 79:28)
I think her design is great I think (79:26 - 79:30)
belly balls are pretty cool I've really (79:28 - 79:32)
liked the character designs this time (79:30 - 79:35)
around but (79:32 - 79:38)
wow I hate everything about her and (79:35 - 79:40)
almost to the point of like do I really (79:38 - 79:41)
want to buy this game I hate this (79:40 - 79:45)
character so much it just makes me think (79:41 - 79:47)
of fan service and it's just like gross (79:45 - 79:47)
to me (79:47 - 79:50)
uh I will say the one thing that annoyed (79:47 - 79:54)
me about the trailer is they gave her (79:50 - 79:57)
the Japanese voice acting style that I (79:54 - 79:59)
really don't like in animates either (79:57 - 80:03)
it's it's it is every they almost every (79:59 - 80:05)
anime has a character voice like this (80:03 - 80:08)
and I am so tired of it and I'm so over (80:05 - 80:11)
it so when I'm like I I just want to (80:08 - 80:12)
read the subtitles and I did mute (80:11 - 80:14)
because I'm like I I cannot listen to (80:12 - 80:17)
this voice acting Style on another (80:14 - 80:20)
character anymore I'm I'm really tired (80:17 - 80:23)
of it yeah I mean (80:20 - 80:25)
whether or not this game has voice (80:23 - 80:30)
acting I'm gonna say no no but again but (80:25 - 80:33)
again like like I said like a month ago (80:30 - 80:36)
I watched somebody play Xenoblade for (80:33 - 80:39)
the first time and that game has like (80:36 - 80:41)
some voice acting but what it does is it (80:39 - 80:42)
gives like the characters like little (80:41 - 80:43)
quips (80:42 - 80:45)
and like hearing them like there's an (80:43 - 80:46)
item there's an item there's an item (80:45 - 80:47)
there's an item there's like over and (80:46 - 80:49)
over again that is way worse than just (80:47 - 80:52)
wait listen over here over here like (80:49 - 80:54)
that like I would rather have no voice (80:52 - 80:57)
acting than like four lines of dialogue (80:54 - 80:59)
that are gonna repeat for two thousand (80:57 - 81:01)
hours like I just (80:59 - 81:04)
they (81:01 - 81:04)
I I don't know (81:04 - 81:08)
um I will say I'm excited for their (81:06 - 81:11)
ventral inclusion into Pokemon Masters (81:08 - 81:12)
which is where I now care about (81:11 - 81:14)
characters going because they actually (81:12 - 81:17)
do something in that game on like the (81:14 - 81:19)
regular bang games where it's like yeah (81:17 - 81:21)
this person exists and they only exist (81:19 - 81:24)
in this one Silo and they never leave (81:21 - 81:27)
leave (81:24 - 81:27)
I think it's done well in Masters but (81:27 - 81:31)
that's not because you're playing (81:30 - 81:34)
Masters for six hours straight (81:31 - 81:35)
like you're getting the little quips in (81:34 - 81:37)
like 10 minute (81:35 - 81:39)
play sessions like that's why I think it (81:37 - 81:41)
works there and I do think the quips in (81:39 - 81:43)
Masters are good like it did make me a (81:41 - 81:45)
second guess and be like oh maybe I do (81:43 - 81:46)
actually want voice acting but then when (81:45 - 81:48)
you see a big open world game like (81:46 - 81:49)
Xenoblade you're like oh I don't want it (81:48 - 81:52)
like that no yeah it's it's tough voice (81:49 - 81:54)
acting is tough (81:52 - 81:55)
um (81:54 - 81:57)
and like (81:55 - 81:59)
I think boy I mean for as much as people (81:57 - 82:02)
hate cut scenes I think voice acting (81:59 - 82:06)
works best in cut scenes and (82:02 - 82:10)
because of game mechanics it gets way (82:06 - 82:12)
too repetitive outside of cutscenes and (82:10 - 82:15)
so in general I prefer (82:12 - 82:20)
voice acting to be limited to cut scenes (82:15 - 82:20)
I mean the the big part of sword and (82:20 - 82:24)
shield is when you get to the musician (82:22 - 82:27)
gym leader (82:24 - 82:29)
and they're singing into a microphone (82:27 - 82:32)
and there's just nothing (82:29 - 82:34)
even Roxy had a song (82:32 - 82:38)
that's true yeah (82:34 - 82:40)
um (82:38 - 82:40)
okay so during that first trailer I (82:42 - 82:45)
wanted to say that for last because I (82:44 - 82:46)
wanted to get through all the official (82:45 - 82:49)
stuff there there there's a there's a (82:46 - 82:51)
point where (82:49 - 82:53)
um if you look at the mini map it shows (82:51 - 82:55)
Pokemon on the minimap and one of those (82:53 - 82:57)
Pokemon is rookity I don't actually know (82:55 - 82:59)
if Rick rickady has been confirmed up to (82:57 - 83:01)
this point but now we know that rookie D (82:59 - 83:02)
is in the game (83:01 - 83:04)
cool I think a lot of people do like (83:02 - 83:06)
rookie D and the corbinite line a lot (83:04 - 83:07)
um I do think they were pretty memorable (83:06 - 83:10)
birds from sword and shield (83:07 - 83:13)
uh but there are also three new Pokemon (83:10 - 83:15)
on that map (83:13 - 83:17)
um which (83:15 - 83:19)
in the Japanese version of that trailer (83:17 - 83:22)
that mini map did not have those Pokemon (83:19 - 83:24)
on it and the English trailer it did we (83:22 - 83:26)
could we could spend another 30 minutes (83:24 - 83:28)
talking about whether that that is (83:26 - 83:31)
intentional or not I mean you see this (83:28 - 83:33)
in the tech world where like apple has (83:31 - 83:35)
purposely leaked the new iPhone because (83:33 - 83:37)
that garnishes a lot of attention and (83:35 - 83:39)
people get super excited and whether or (83:37 - 83:43)
not that's true uh who knows so did (83:39 - 83:47)
somebody forget to cut those Pokemon or (83:43 - 83:49)
is it intentional for one or the other (83:47 - 83:51)
to get like the Japanese people to go (83:49 - 83:52)
over and watch the american trailer or (83:51 - 83:55)
to get American people to talk about it (83:52 - 83:57)
so then other people pick it up I don't (83:55 - 83:58)
know (83:57 - 84:00)
um does it matter (83:58 - 84:03)
yeah like it doesn't matter and who (84:00 - 84:04)
knows uh (84:03 - 84:06)
so there there's like a little white (84:04 - 84:09)
mouse Pokemon there's two of them and if (84:06 - 84:11)
you were to really look carefully their (84:09 - 84:13)
tails are slightly different one tail is (84:11 - 84:14)
like up in the air with the other tail (84:13 - 84:17)
is down so that's safe to maybe assume (84:14 - 84:18)
that there's gender differences in this (84:17 - 84:20)
little white mouse it kind of looks like (84:18 - 84:22)
really swagging its tail and it's stuck (84:20 - 84:25)
in in a mini map has motion yeah I do (84:22 - 84:27)
want to remind everyone that there was a (84:25 - 84:30)
24-hour Ponyta debut in sword and shield (84:27 - 84:32)
and one of the ponytails that came (84:30 - 84:35)
running out was missing a tail and (84:32 - 84:36)
everyone thought oh that must be the (84:35 - 84:39)
male Ponyta no it they just forgot to (84:36 - 84:42)
animate the tail like I mean yeah (84:39 - 84:45)
there's not a lot we can derive from (84:42 - 84:49)
tail position in a in a still (84:45 - 84:52)
um so on a mini map so there there's (84:49 - 84:54)
there's two little mice they're white (84:52 - 84:57)
they look like very simple minchinos I'm (84:54 - 84:58)
not saying that is a bad thing it's just (84:57 - 85:00)
not we're on an audio podcast I'm trying (84:58 - 85:02)
to paint a picture uh and then they (85:00 - 85:05)
showed a green parrot (85:02 - 85:07)
uh which looks like it has like a little (85:05 - 85:10)
afro or a mohawk or or a hat I'm not (85:07 - 85:11)
sure (85:10 - 85:13)
um and then the last Pokemon in there (85:11 - 85:16)
was like a mushroom slash salts thing (85:13 - 85:18)
slash (85:16 - 85:20)
truffle some people are maybe saying (85:18 - 85:22)
it's a truffle because of lechonk and (85:20 - 85:26)
pigs truffles yeah I mean it kind of (85:22 - 85:27)
looks like a house as like a mushroom (85:26 - 85:32)
house what's cat like (85:27 - 85:34)
it feels like it has a cinder block (85:32 - 85:37)
coming out of its head (85:34 - 85:37)
let me look at it again (85:38 - 85:41)
uh (85:40 - 85:45)
so yeah like there are three I breaking (85:41 - 85:47)
news there are new Pokemon in the (85:45 - 85:49)
Pokemon game uh there are three Pokemon (85:47 - 85:51)
that we kind of know what they look like (85:49 - 85:53)
you can kind of know what they might be (85:51 - 85:55)
but we don't know anything about them (85:53 - 85:58)
yeah so it looks so the mushroom looks (85:55 - 86:00)
like a cinder block kind of the bottom (85:58 - 86:02)
eyes kind of look like a cinder block (86:00 - 86:03)
and it looks like a cinder block (86:02 - 86:05)
sticking out of its head (86:03 - 86:07)
and the tail difference that people are (86:05 - 86:10)
going out about is not that exaggerated (86:07 - 86:13)
it's like it tails up and one Tails down (86:10 - 86:17)
oh it's like seats in an airline upright (86:13 - 86:19)
leaning back I mean it's literally this (86:17 - 86:22)
much of a difference it's upright and (86:19 - 86:25)
then slightly back (86:22 - 86:25)
and it's got and the parrot has like a (86:25 - 86:30)
pompadour it kind of looks like (86:29 - 86:32)
quaxley's pompadour to be quite honest (86:30 - 86:35)
it's it's it's not a straight line it's (86:32 - 86:37)
a big it's a dollop on the front of its (86:35 - 86:40)
head like a pompadour (86:37 - 86:40)
yeah it's and like it's so hard to even (86:40 - 86:45)
be like I like these Pokemon because (86:44 - 86:47)
they're so tiny they're tiny and who (86:45 - 86:49)
knows if anything the more exciting part (86:47 - 86:50)
is like the Pokemon are showing up on (86:49 - 86:52)
the mini map I think that's actually (86:50 - 86:54)
like yeah that is the cool part (86:52 - 86:56)
um so like one the game has a mini map (86:54 - 87:00)
which sword and shield did not to uh if (86:56 - 87:01)
you're exploring the area for the first (87:00 - 87:03)
time and you see something on the mini (87:01 - 87:04)
map you can (87:03 - 87:08)
know where to like turn to to like go to (87:04 - 87:10)
um (87:08 - 87:10)
we're what five we're five weeks four (87:10 - 87:17)
weeks from four weeks I think the game (87:14 - 87:19)
so I'm I'm I would expect that we would (87:17 - 87:21)
have you know one new Pokemon or maybe (87:19 - 87:23)
another gym leader or maybe a feature (87:21 - 87:25)
you know once a week this is where you (87:23 - 87:26)
really (87:25 - 87:30)
want to advertise that still a zero out (87:26 - 87:34)
of ten game no no uh Rosalia (87:30 - 87:36)
um (87:34 - 87:36)
a lot of good Pokemon news I you know I (87:37 - 87:42)
don't know if the sandwiches itself is (87:40 - 87:45)
convincing anyone to pre-order this game (87:42 - 87:48)
um uh maybe the gym leader stuff was (87:45 - 87:51)
exciting or fancy enough for people to (87:48 - 87:53)
be like yeah this is this is something I (87:51 - 87:55)
want I mean I think (87:53 - 87:55)
I think where they are done sort of this (87:56 - 88:01)
is all hype and now they're just trying (87:59 - 88:05)
to say okay so people hey here's here's (88:01 - 88:06)
the things that are going to be (88:05 - 88:09)
happening in this game like hi you (88:06 - 88:12)
remember how Curry worked well it's now (88:09 - 88:15)
sandwiches you remembered how this work (88:12 - 88:17)
is a we're at the point where they are (88:15 - 88:20)
selling fans on what to expect to make (88:17 - 88:23)
fans more invested I think we aren't in (88:20 - 88:25)
the uh (88:23 - 88:28)
in the hey we're going to get new people (88:25 - 88:30)
buying like the hype train is now moved (88:28 - 88:33)
into the let's get everybody on board (88:30 - 88:35)
and start answering questions so people (88:33 - 88:36)
can be prepared for the game they're (88:35 - 88:39)
about to play I wonder if there's like (88:36 - 88:42)
another thing to the triathlizing thing (88:39 - 88:45)
that we haven't seen yet (88:42 - 88:45)
um yeah like how they gosh I don't (88:45 - 88:50)
actually remember if they did this maybe (88:48 - 88:52)
my memory is just wrong but they could (88:50 - 88:54)
show Dynamax and be like look at Pokemon (88:52 - 88:56)
get really big and they do attacks but (88:54 - 88:58)
they they could have hold up held off (88:56 - 89:00)
and I don't know if they did gigantom X (88:58 - 89:02)
where they're like Oh I thought they (89:00 - 89:06)
showed El creamy mm-hmm yeah I (89:02 - 89:07)
I don't know if they did that at the (89:06 - 89:09)
same time but I again I just wonder if (89:07 - 89:12)
like they showed us some terrazolizing (89:09 - 89:15)
things is there something where (89:12 - 89:19)
frapparig trastalizes and something (89:15 - 89:23)
changes specifically like hey giraffe (89:19 - 89:26)
for Ridge rap sorry these 20 Pokemon are (89:23 - 89:29)
kind of like gigantomax in sword and (89:26 - 89:30)
shield (89:29 - 89:32)
um I don't think that I don't know if (89:30 - 89:33)
that like (89:32 - 89:35)
convinces anyone I think people are (89:33 - 89:36)
pretty much like yeah terrazolizing (89:35 - 89:39)
scene cool or yeah trans-alizing seems (89:36 - 89:41)
bad I mean it was the same with it was (89:39 - 89:43)
the same one yeah Dynamax like people (89:41 - 89:45)
made their opinions up pretty quickly (89:43 - 89:48)
before like the hats just (89:45 - 89:50)
um and some people's opinions change (89:48 - 89:51)
once they tried it (89:50 - 89:54)
uh but I don't know I will say my (89:51 - 89:56)
favorite part of this trailer was when (89:54 - 89:58)
they said any Pokemon can have any (89:56 - 90:01)
harass Tara type and they then they said (89:58 - 90:05)
Will Anderson was right (90:01 - 90:07)
listen to Will (90:05 - 90:08)
say that they did say that that's 100 (90:07 - 90:10)
true but they also said well attitude (90:08 - 90:12)
was right because that will that is a (90:10 - 90:14)
sentence that nobody should ever utter (90:12 - 90:16)
they also said the only way to get (90:14 - 90:18)
Pikachu with the flying terrazole type (90:16 - 90:23)
is to download him the first that is not (90:18 - 90:24)
what they said (90:23 - 90:27)
they said the only way to get this (90:24 - 90:29)
Pikachu because it also knows a special (90:27 - 90:33)
move hmm so it's a flying type Pikachu (90:29 - 90:36)
with that move (90:33 - 90:38)
okay (90:36 - 90:38)
let's see how they do that that's a lot (90:39 - 90:43)
that's what 18 types assuming there's (90:41 - 90:45)
400 Pokemon (90:43 - 90:45)
you know but don't worry you you can (90:47 - 90:52)
grind that as you grind for yourself (90:49 - 90:54)
they're taking rock type out of the game (90:52 - 90:58)
so okay good they realize they don't (90:54 - 91:01)
need Rock and ground so (90:58 - 91:03)
Brock the right that but that that's not (91:01 - 91:06)
how does Brock have a rocket ship (91:03 - 91:09)
I we cannot spend any time talking about (91:06 - 91:11)
that movie or Netflix special or (91:09 - 91:13)
whatever definitely special (91:11 - 91:16)
okay uh real quick we'll just do the the (91:13 - 91:18)
Pokemon go thing I do think this is (91:16 - 91:20)
worth talking about they introduced (91:18 - 91:23)
another new raid called Elite raids (91:20 - 91:25)
um the elite raids are supposed to (91:23 - 91:29)
replace ex raids (91:25 - 91:30)
um I guess I should probably explain (91:29 - 91:32)
what that is uh back in the day before (91:30 - 91:34)
the world shut down and before covid was (91:32 - 91:36)
a thing there was something called ex (91:34 - 91:38)
raids and they would appear at specific (91:36 - 91:40)
gyms they started off appearing at (91:38 - 91:42)
sponsor gyms I don't know if people (91:40 - 91:43)
remember this but Pokemon go had a (91:42 - 91:46)
sponsorship with Sprint which no longer (91:43 - 91:47)
exists because they are not owned by (91:46 - 91:48)
T-Mobile (91:47 - 91:51)
um but all the other way around (91:48 - 91:54)
no T-Mobile owns Sprint no Sprint bought (91:51 - 91:56)
T-Mobile but it's still called T-Mobile (91:54 - 91:59)
Irene had yeah yeah because I read (91:56 - 92:01)
T-Mobile and sea level is more brand (91:59 - 92:03)
recognizable but Sprint had the money to (92:01 - 92:05)
buy T-Mobile got it okay so all the (92:03 - 92:07)
Sprint stores (92:05 - 92:10)
were ex gyms part of the sponsorships (92:07 - 92:11)
and then there were other gyms that just (92:10 - 92:14)
were ex available and you could tell (92:11 - 92:15)
this when you clicked on a gym up like (92:14 - 92:17)
above it the name of the gym where it (92:15 - 92:19)
would say like uh somebody's gravestone (92:17 - 92:22)
it would say like ex gym above it (92:19 - 92:26)
and the concept was that ex gyms were (92:22 - 92:29)
really powerful gyms or raids that you (92:26 - 92:33)
had to be invited to and not right off (92:29 - 92:35)
the bat but pretty quickly after they (92:33 - 92:36)
were released if you were invited to an (92:35 - 92:38)
ex gym you could invite somebody else to (92:36 - 92:40)
an ex gym so I could be like hey Greg I (92:38 - 92:42)
got an invite to this ex gym let me (92:40 - 92:44)
invite you we'll both go there at two (92:42 - 92:47)
o'clock and they were set times and when (92:44 - 92:48)
they first did ex gyms they started off (92:47 - 92:50)
with Mewtwo (92:48 - 92:53)
um and then they moved on to uh (92:50 - 92:56)
I know Reggie gigas was in them I want (92:53 - 92:58)
to say like Deoxys was first introduced (92:56 - 93:00)
in them I can't remember if no I don't (92:58 - 93:02)
think Darkrai was there was a couple (93:00 - 93:04)
like EX Pokemon (93:02 - 93:06)
um they weren't restricted to mythicals (93:04 - 93:08)
but I yeah I'm almost positive Deoxys (93:06 - 93:10)
was specifically in them first (93:08 - 93:12)
uh so they would give you certain times (93:10 - 93:15)
you would you would do a raid at an ex (93:12 - 93:17)
gym that would qualify for you for an ex (93:15 - 93:19)
pass a week later it would be like (93:17 - 93:21)
congrats you got an ex pass at two (93:19 - 93:24)
o'clock on Saturday at this gym please (93:21 - 93:25)
be there and then you show up and other (93:24 - 93:27)
people are there and then you do it and (93:25 - 93:29)
then you go I did it and then you go (93:27 - 93:31)
home and it was just like another raid (93:29 - 93:33)
I personally liked it and the reason I (93:31 - 93:37)
liked it is because I despised using (93:33 - 93:39)
Discord or Facebook to try to (93:37 - 93:42)
make find groups or try to coordinate (93:39 - 93:44)
times (93:42 - 93:44)
um (93:44 - 93:47)
and it was just great to get like a (93:44 - 93:49)
ticket saying hey at two o'clock be here (93:47 - 93:51)
do it you would show up other people (93:49 - 93:53)
would also be there you know somebody (93:51 - 93:55)
would be like the leader they'd be like (93:53 - 93:56)
let's wait 10 minutes and you know of (93:55 - 93:58)
course anyone's late well I wanna and (93:56 - 93:59)
then if you were the one that was like (93:58 - 94:01)
10 minutes late like they already (93:59 - 94:02)
started and then there was Zero people (94:01 - 94:03)
to do it with because everyone else (94:02 - 94:05)
completed it there were problems with it (94:03 - 94:06)
but I think that's the problem with all (94:05 - 94:08)
raids right like that's not exclusive to (94:06 - 94:09)
ex you know if there's a group of people (94:08 - 94:10)
they already started it and no one wants (94:09 - 94:12)
to back out to let you in you know (94:10 - 94:14)
hopefully another group there's always (94:12 - 94:16)
that one person's like let's divide up (94:14 - 94:18)
by colors make sure maximizing and I'm (94:16 - 94:19)
like I'm just going into whichever one (94:18 - 94:21)
of them that list (94:19 - 94:22)
um (94:21 - 94:26)
so and the the complaints to the ex raid (94:22 - 94:29)
system was like I got an ex raid at you (94:26 - 94:30)
know two o'clock on Wednesday and I have (94:29 - 94:32)
a nine to five job (94:30 - 94:37)
or I got a ex raid on Christmas (94:32 - 94:37)
for an indoor shop that's closed and so (94:37 - 94:45)
is the building because it's Christmas (94:42 - 94:47)
um (94:45 - 94:50)
you know every I I was invited to a lot (94:47 - 94:51)
of EX raids when ex-raids were a thing (94:50 - 94:54)
uh because there were a lot of EX raids (94:51 - 94:57)
in Milwaukee and I just happened to rate (94:54 - 94:58)
at those things and everyone I went to (94:57 - 95:00)
whether it was two o'clock six o'clock (94:58 - 95:02)
whether it was Saturday Wednesday (95:00 - 95:04)
Tuesday there was always enough people (95:02 - 95:06)
as much as people were like hey I got (95:04 - 95:09)
work at two o'clock there was always (95:06 - 95:10)
like three dudes in business suits (95:09 - 95:13)
rolling up to get their Mewtwo like some (95:10 - 95:14)
people made time some people have the (95:13 - 95:15)
flexibility to make time some people (95:14 - 95:17)
don't like (95:15 - 95:19)
would it have been better if you know (95:17 - 95:21)
you got any x-rayed pass and it was like (95:19 - 95:22)
hey do you want the 11 o'clock or the (95:21 - 95:23)
six o'clock (95:22 - 95:25)
sure but (95:23 - 95:29)
the fact that this game even works is is (95:25 - 95:31)
surprising in itself (95:29 - 95:35)
so the new thing Elite trades (95:31 - 95:37)
uh which started yesterday (95:35 - 95:40)
uh they're supposed to pop at a certain (95:37 - 95:44)
time they say here 11 2 or 5 and then in (95:40 - 95:47)
exactly 24 hours that raid would start (95:44 - 95:49)
and you don't need a special ticket to (95:47 - 95:50)
do it (95:49 - 95:53)
um so the the marketing thing I did you (95:50 - 95:55)
know Niantic did show this off to me and (95:53 - 95:57)
some other YouTubers a couple days early (95:55 - 95:58)
to you know get our thoughts and explain (95:57 - 96:00)
how it worked and you know to you know (95:58 - 96:02)
answer any questions the community had (96:00 - 96:05)
their thought process behind it was like (96:02 - 96:06)
well we want it to spawn during (96:05 - 96:07)
Community Day so when people are out (96:06 - 96:09)
doing community they could understand or (96:07 - 96:11)
figure out what it was and then make (96:09 - 96:13)
plans with the community the next day to (96:11 - 96:14)
come back and do it (96:13 - 96:17)
which I think is fair because I think (96:14 - 96:19)
there is a lot of Pokemon go players (96:17 - 96:20)
that as soon as they open the game they (96:19 - 96:22)
get that notification of like news and (96:20 - 96:23)
they close it right away and they don't (96:22 - 96:24)
read it there's a lot of Pokemon go (96:23 - 96:26)
players that don't live on Twitter don't (96:24 - 96:28)
read Twitter there's a lot of Pokemon go (96:26 - 96:30)
players that don't go to the Silph Road (96:28 - 96:31)
or whatever (96:30 - 96:33)
um (96:31 - 96:33)
there are people who play this game that (96:34 - 96:39)
just don't live online and consume as (96:36 - 96:40)
much Pokemon go news as possible that (96:39 - 96:42)
doesn't mean they should be left out so (96:40 - 96:43)
I think (96:42 - 96:45)
I don't know this niantic's never said (96:43 - 96:47)
this but I would wager to bet that (96:45 - 96:50)
Community Day is the day where most (96:47 - 96:53)
people open the app and play the game (96:50 - 96:55)
I just think like out of any day of the (96:53 - 96:56)
month (96:55 - 96:58)
this is when the most people play and (96:56 - 97:00)
interact with your game as the this (96:58 - 97:02)
community day so to advertise a new (97:00 - 97:03)
feature (97:02 - 97:06)
and say like hey in 24 hours this is (97:03 - 97:07)
gonna start (97:06 - 97:09)
I think it's really great so the ideal (97:07 - 97:11)
behind Elite raids is it's supposed to (97:09 - 97:14)
be a very hard Raid Battle they appear (97:11 - 97:16)
they they do 24 hours once it hatches (97:14 - 97:18)
The Raid boss will appear for 30 minutes (97:16 - 97:19)
they said the raid boss this time was (97:18 - 97:22)
Hoopa Unbound which is a lot of people (97:19 - 97:23)
are missing Hoopa unless they paid that (97:22 - 97:25)
like seven unless they finish that (97:23 - 97:27)
research and then paid like 7.99 or (97:25 - 97:29)
whatever I don't know (97:27 - 97:33)
um and then uh they said you know no (97:29 - 97:37)
remote raid passes we want people to (97:33 - 97:39)
be like hey in 24 hours this is popping (97:37 - 97:41)
well I'll come back do it together we (97:39 - 97:43)
know exactly what time there's no (97:41 - 97:45)
confusion we don't need Discord for that (97:43 - 97:49)
uh and then when you defeat and catch it (97:45 - 97:51)
something is supposed to happen for 15 (97:49 - 97:54)
minutes and they told us a rare Pokemon (97:51 - 97:57)
would spawn not for everyone but it (97:54 - 98:00)
would be like a random gosh how did they (97:57 - 98:02)
explain it so you know when you defeat (98:00 - 98:04)
lampet and then more land more litwicks (98:02 - 98:06)
spawn it was like that you defeated the (98:04 - 98:08)
hoopa and then for 15 minutes something (98:06 - 98:10)
spawns around it and they said rare (98:08 - 98:12)
spawns and they said like a legendary I (98:10 - 98:13)
think people were reporting that (98:12 - 98:15)
articuno's Bond (98:13 - 98:16)
um (98:15 - 98:18)
so you could then be like oh there's a (98:16 - 98:20)
wild Articuno that's exciting and cool (98:18 - 98:21)
maybe I can catch it but they said it (98:20 - 98:24)
didn't appear for everyone that the the (98:21 - 98:26)
Pokemon that spawned were were (98:24 - 98:29)
completely random and some people could (98:26 - 98:31)
get more lucky than others but it was (98:29 - 98:32)
supposed to be a bunch of like really (98:31 - 98:35)
cool Pokemon Articuno being like the (98:32 - 98:39)
coolest and that was supposed to be (98:35 - 98:39)
I think they didn't say this to me but I (98:40 - 98:45)
think that I that I think it wasn't (98:43 - 98:47)
really about like rare Pokemon spawning (98:45 - 98:50)
I think it was about (98:47 - 98:53)
Pokemon interesting enough to spawn so (98:50 - 98:57)
you would stay after the raid to like (98:53 - 99:00)
Mingle (98:57 - 99:00)
because there's like two sides of this (99:00 - 99:05)
there's like (99:02 - 99:09)
the side where people are like (99:05 - 99:13)
no one does in-person raids anymore my (99:09 - 99:16)
whole Community is remote raids right (99:13 - 99:19)
and they're like Niantic should do (99:16 - 99:22)
something so people do in-person raids (99:19 - 99:25)
or like my community is dead now because (99:22 - 99:28)
of remote raids what is Niantic going to (99:25 - 99:29)
do to fix this (99:28 - 99:33)
and so niantic's Solutions I think are (99:29 - 99:35)
pretty good (99:33 - 99:39)
in my opinion of like (99:35 - 99:39)
hey after Community Day if your (99:39 - 99:44)
community does a Lampent Litwick spawn (99:41 - 99:46)
and that encourages people to help out (99:44 - 99:48)
or stay after and like talk and I think (99:46 - 99:51)
this is like okay well you need to be in (99:48 - 99:53)
person we're giving it 24 hours so you (99:51 - 99:54)
don't need a Discord or anything you can (99:53 - 99:57)
look at it and like meet there (99:54 - 99:58)
and then we're giving you some cool (99:57 - 100:01)
bonuses afterwards so you don't go there (99:58 - 100:03)
do a raid and immediately walk away when (100:01 - 100:06)
it's done which was a million percent my (100:03 - 100:08)
experience in ex raids I showed up I (100:06 - 100:10)
didn't talk to anyone I did it as soon (100:08 - 100:12)
as it was over I was back in my car like (100:10 - 100:14)
I didn't talk to anyone the entire time (100:12 - 100:16)
so I I do want to give Niantic some (100:14 - 100:19)
credit that like they are trying the (100:16 - 100:22)
best they can to like help you do a (100:19 - 100:24)
community but it's like still on your (100:22 - 100:26)
community to (100:24 - 100:28)
do that right like you you can't just (100:26 - 100:31)
blame Niantic for not trying when they (100:28 - 100:33)
are trying to like here are some cool (100:31 - 100:34)
spawns like please stay a little bit (100:33 - 100:36)
longer and hopefully if you stay you (100:34 - 100:38)
like chit chat like we're like what else (100:36 - 100:40)
do you want us to do you want to give (100:38 - 100:42)
you like five dollars to stay like yes (100:40 - 100:46)
yes I pay me for my time please so when (100:42 - 100:49)
they told me that like oh a Tupa you (100:46 - 100:51)
know we're gonna have more (100:49 - 100:54)
um I really thought it was cool uh turns (100:51 - 100:58)
out that it broke yesterday oh and none (100:54 - 101:00)
of them actually spawned until like I (100:58 - 101:02)
think six (101:00 - 101:05)
because we were we will and I got uh (101:02 - 101:07)
dinner yeah and but at six o'clock we (101:05 - 101:09)
didn't see any yeah so mall America (101:07 - 101:10)
didn't have any even though mall America (101:09 - 101:12)
has like three ex raids they didn't have (101:10 - 101:14)
any um but I did check campfire and (101:12 - 101:16)
there are ex raids happening in the area (101:14 - 101:18)
just Mall of America that was weird to (101:16 - 101:21)
me that mall America didn't have any (101:18 - 101:23)
why is that weird like they haven't (101:21 - 101:25)
figured out how to do raids on community (101:23 - 101:26)
today yet (101:25 - 101:29)
yeah that's true (101:26 - 101:29)
I'm getting blinded over here by the sun (101:30 - 101:37)
uh the the the complaint I guess is the (101:32 - 101:38)
the problem with ex raids and I guess (101:37 - 101:40)
the the similar problem with Elite raids (101:38 - 101:42)
were uh it would introduce something (101:40 - 101:45)
called gym lockout and what that is is (101:42 - 101:48)
when an elite raid spawns (101:45 - 101:50)
that means that Jim can't have any other (101:48 - 101:52)
raids for 24 hours you can't have any (101:50 - 101:56)
Xerneas or give it all or or or Moral (101:52 - 101:58)
Moral can be in raids now if you want to (101:56 - 102:00)
do a one-star mortal (101:58 - 102:03)
um and I I personally (102:00 - 102:05)
I don't know if I find that a bad thing (102:03 - 102:07)
because my thought process is (102:05 - 102:10)
you know if if Xerneas is around for (102:07 - 102:12)
two weeks you have plenty of (102:10 - 102:13)
opportunities even if you only have one (102:12 - 102:16)
gym in your town to do Xerneas right (102:13 - 102:18)
granted you have other people to do that (102:16 - 102:20)
Xerneas with or if you're relying on (102:18 - 102:22)
remote raid passes you can invite other (102:20 - 102:23)
people to do it (102:22 - 102:26)
and you can't control the spawns anyways (102:23 - 102:28)
in the gym so even you might be like (102:26 - 102:29)
well I want to do Xerneas well you're (102:28 - 102:31)
not guaranteed Xerneas it could just be (102:29 - 102:33)
moral over and over (102:31 - 102:35)
um and if you're saying like Okay this (102:33 - 102:37)
Gym's gonna be locked for 24 hours (102:35 - 102:39)
you are getting a really cool Pokemon at (102:37 - 102:41)
the end of it like I think Hoopa Unbound (102:39 - 102:43)
is way cooler than like (102:41 - 102:47)
six non-shiny xerneases I mean if you (102:43 - 102:53)
win the raid yeah yeah to win the raid (102:47 - 102:53)
um and then you know you're supposed to (102:53 - 102:56)
get you know (102:55 - 102:59)
rare slash special spawns afterwards (102:56 - 103:02)
like I I do think (102:59 - 103:04)
like you can't have everything (103:02 - 103:07)
like and if you have if if you if if you (103:04 - 103:10)
have one gym in your town (103:07 - 103:13)
well that's that's its own problem in (103:10 - 103:15)
itself right because Pokemon go is (103:13 - 103:17)
unfair and if you live in cities it's a (103:15 - 103:20)
better experience but (103:17 - 103:20)
I try I try to put myself in my shoes of (103:20 - 103:25)
like okay if I if I live in a town with (103:23 - 103:26)
only one gym and it's really hard for me (103:25 - 103:30)
to travel and would you not rather want (103:26 - 103:34)
the Hoopa guaranteed after 24 hours or (103:30 - 103:36)
would you just not like would you would (103:34 - 103:37)
you not complain if you didn't get the (103:36 - 103:39)
Hoopa at all like I feel like you would (103:37 - 103:41)
complain if like I have one gym and I (103:39 - 103:42)
didn't get the Hoopa (103:41 - 103:44)
right like you would want the Hoopa (103:42 - 103:46)
still even though the gym is locked out (103:44 - 103:49)
for 24 hours (103:46 - 103:49)
like having Hoopa is better than I don't (103:50 - 103:56)
want the Hoopa (103:53 - 103:56)
I guess yeah yeah like yeah you would (103:57 - 104:04)
want the Hoopa still Maybe (104:00 - 104:04)
are people really complaining about the (104:05 - 104:09)
gym lockout yeah yeah that's the number (104:07 - 104:11)
one complaint (104:09 - 104:12)
I mean the complaint from the gym (104:11 - 104:15)
lockout for ex raids was like a little (104:12 - 104:17)
bit more sound because the gym would be (104:15 - 104:19)
locked out because of an ex raid but (104:17 - 104:21)
then you wouldn't have a ticket to the (104:19 - 104:23)
ex-ray right that's that's the big (104:21 - 104:25)
difference right because anybody can do (104:23 - 104:28)
the ex raid or anyone can do the elite (104:25 - 104:31)
raid not anyone could do this yes yes (104:28 - 104:33)
and you had to be invited to the other (104:31 - 104:35)
kind so that that does make a big (104:33 - 104:38)
difference yeah I I think this is a (104:35 - 104:42)
better solution to what was I don't know (104:38 - 104:44)
if ex rides are coming back but this (104:42 - 104:45)
seems like the replacement (104:44 - 104:47)
I don't think they said that I don't (104:45 - 104:48)
think they said that this is the (104:47 - 104:49)
replacement this is the replacement but (104:48 - 104:51)
it is (104:49 - 104:53)
so they said they said more of these (104:51 - 104:54)
will appear (104:53 - 104:57)
um it broke so they didn't specifically (104:54 - 104:58)
spawn (104:57 - 105:02)
um I have seen people uh talk about how (104:58 - 105:04)
they showed up and no one else showed up (105:02 - 105:07)
and they tried to do it with five and it (105:04 - 105:08)
wasn't enough and it was really (105:07 - 105:10)
frustrating I saw people say they did do (105:08 - 105:12)
it and the special spawns did not happen (105:10 - 105:16)
I can tell you from talking and Niantic (105:12 - 105:17)
directly they were well aware that (105:16 - 105:20)
things were broken and they told us to (105:17 - 105:21)
please be patient they were working on (105:20 - 105:24)
it they (105:21 - 105:24)
not a not a great first impression of a (105:24 - 105:29)
system purely because of everything I (105:27 - 105:33)
just listed like it sounds like (105:29 - 105:33)
something technical broke and campfire's (105:33 - 105:39)
not out yet which would have been really (105:37 - 105:41)
nice if campfire was out for everyone to (105:39 - 105:43)
scan their area for where these are I (105:41 - 105:45)
think (105:43 - 105:47)
when they showed it to me and they were (105:45 - 105:48)
like what'd you think and when I read (105:47 - 105:50)
everything I was like this actually (105:48 - 105:52)
sounds really awesome I was excited for (105:50 - 105:53)
it yesterday (105:52 - 105:56)
then I was like oh this is all broken (105:53 - 105:59)
and I (105:56 - 106:02)
don't think I'm doing one (105:59 - 106:04)
like I guess maybe when they try it for (106:02 - 106:06)
the second time we'll see if it's (106:04 - 106:09)
they they fix the problems (106:06 - 106:11)
um which is a bummer you know you know (106:09 - 106:14)
we we at least I don't think niantic's a (106:11 - 106:16)
perfect company we criticize Niantic a (106:14 - 106:18)
lot here (106:16 - 106:21)
but it does suck that this sounded (106:18 - 106:22)
exciting (106:21 - 106:24)
and it just didn't work (106:22 - 106:27)
the way it should have (106:24 - 106:29)
so (106:27 - 106:31)
that sucks like I don't want to see (106:29 - 106:32)
Niantic fail I want them to like make (106:31 - 106:34)
exciting things for the game where every (106:32 - 106:36)
player is like yeah this is great this (106:34 - 106:38)
is exciting like like I remember when (106:36 - 106:39)
they revamped megas and they were like (106:38 - 106:41)
we changed the whole Mega System no one (106:39 - 106:42)
complained everyone was like this is (106:41 - 106:45)
great this is how it should have been I (106:42 - 106:47)
use megas every day now like that's a (106:45 - 106:49)
huge W and great for Niantic to figure (106:47 - 106:51)
that out and I was hoping that this (106:49 - 106:53)
would be another huge W minus like again (106:51 - 106:55)
you can't this doesn't suddenly solve (106:53 - 106:57)
the problem that people who live in the (106:55 - 106:59)
middle of nowhere I've always had with (106:57 - 107:00)
Pokemon go (106:59 - 107:04)
um but technical issues (107:00 - 107:06)
the perf that's an outlet like it's it's (107:04 - 107:11)
now instead of a w unfortunately (107:06 - 107:11)
Pokemon go players in small towns need (107:11 - 107:15)
to learn from the gays if you want to (107:13 - 107:20)
live your best life move to the city (107:15 - 107:20)
move move if there's any advice this (107:20 - 107:25)
show has ever given it's that one right (107:23 - 107:28)
there yep move to the city gays (107:25 - 107:32)

America or Mexico uh sorry like the (107:55 - 108:00)
Pokemon company clearly forgets those (107:58 - 108:02)
places exist (108:00 - 108:03)
um (108:02 - 108:05)
if you're in Canada you're just going to (108:03 - 108:07)

Target will give you more Shadow I I (108:19 - 108:25)
don't know brand deals I'm not 100 like (108:22 - 108:27)
all of this is just money exchanging (108:25 - 108:29)
hands for marketing purposes and stuff (108:27 - 108:32)
uh mythical stands for marketing if (108:29 - 108:34)
you've new to the show and you're (108:32 - 108:35)
unaware of why they do mythical Pokemon (108:34 - 108:38)
mythical Pokemon are purely marketing (108:35 - 108:40)
Pokemon that's that's why they exist (108:38 - 108:42)
they exist too (108:40 - 108:46)
uh sell more copies of games or (108:42 - 108:50)
plushes or t-shirts or whatever (108:46 - 108:52)
um (108:50 - 108:52)
Greg uh question of the week (108:54 - 109:00)
ask what you like like what you ask (108:56 - 109:03)
Now's the Time for the question of the (109:00 - 109:06)
week (109:03 - 109:06)
ah this is from Parker from our YouTube (109:09 - 109:12)
If you would like to leave a question of (109:11 - 109:15)
the week uh youtube.com (109:12 - 109:17)
pkmncst find the latest episode leave (109:15 - 109:20)
your question we'll pick one uh pretty (109:17 - 109:21)
easy one are you guys doing a mini (109:20 - 109:24)
series for scarlet and violet I don't (109:21 - 109:26)
know if that's possible considering the (109:24 - 109:28)
three stories thing but I was wondering (109:26 - 109:31)
what your ideals are (109:28 - 109:31)
well we are hoping there's three actual (109:31 - 109:36)
stories (109:34 - 109:36)
uh well will usually doesn't do the (109:37 - 109:40)
miniseries because they play at their (109:38 - 109:42)
own pace (109:40 - 109:45)
also I hate this game so (109:42 - 109:45)
Greg and I usually do the mini series (109:46 - 109:49)
and I think we had a great time doing (109:48 - 109:51)
let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee and and (109:49 - 109:55)
Brilliant Diamond shining Pearl and we (109:51 - 109:57)
had a great time doing brilliant I think (109:55 - 109:58)
we had a great time talking about (109:57 - 110:01)
brilliant we did uh (109:58 - 110:06)
and uh I mean I think I I would like to (110:01 - 110:08)
do it again I have that week off (110:06 - 110:10)
but I think we need to have like a (110:08 - 110:14)
serious discussion about what (110:10 - 110:18)
what we're doing because if it's (110:14 - 110:21)
technically open world are like (110:18 - 110:23)
we have to talk about like are we going (110:21 - 110:26)
to take side trips to do like one in (110:23 - 110:29)
each storyline and then a gym or like I (110:26 - 110:30)
don't know what that looks like since (110:29 - 110:34)
they are technically separate storylines (110:30 - 110:37)
yeah I mean we could structure it like (110:34 - 110:40)
we have always structured it is we're (110:37 - 110:42)
going to do 10 episodes eight of those (110:40 - 110:45)
episodes are one through eight gyms uh (110:42 - 110:48)
one of those episodes is just before gym (110:45 - 110:50)
one and then the last episode is the (110:48 - 110:52)
Elite Four (110:50 - 110:54)
uh that that is a structure that we (110:52 - 110:57)
could do but like (110:54 - 111:00)
what do we include yeah do like how much (110:57 - 111:02)
team star is there how much sandwich (111:00 - 111:05)
making is there how much Titan stuff is (111:02 - 111:07)
there we know there's one Titan we know (111:05 - 111:08)
there's like the cloth thing that (111:07 - 111:10)
existed like is that part of the (111:08 - 111:12)
storyline do you have to is that is is (111:10 - 111:15)
cloth blocking an area that you can't (111:12 - 111:17)
get to that you need to do (111:15 - 111:19)
yeah (111:17 - 111:19)
um (111:19 - 111:23)
I don't know I I think we did a pretty (111:19 - 111:26)
okay job with the Legends stuff (111:23 - 111:29)
um but legends is an incredibly tiny (111:26 - 111:31)
game compared to other Pokemon games (111:29 - 111:32)
like (111:31 - 111:35)
I say it all the time I will continue to (111:32 - 111:36)
say it there are like seven battles in (111:35 - 111:39)
that entire game and like three of them (111:36 - 111:42)
are against like Togepi and Pikachu like (111:39 - 111:43)
there there are not a lot of battles (111:42 - 111:45)
there's just a lot of catching there (111:43 - 111:47)
were five (111:45 - 111:50)
um Nobles (111:47 - 111:50)
um and I think we did like three (111:50 - 111:55)
two-hour episodes covering our thoughts (111:53 - 111:57)
and I think that was pretty good (111:55 - 111:58)
um but again that game wasn't open world (111:57 - 112:01)
that game was here are five areas when (111:58 - 112:03)
you complete this area this next one (112:01 - 112:04)
unlocks when you complete this area this (112:03 - 112:06)
next one unlocks like there was a (112:04 - 112:08)
structure in that game (112:06 - 112:10)
um and yeah you could get lost in an (112:08 - 112:12)
area but it wasn't like (112:10 - 112:15)
I'm doing this huge side quest for Mr (112:12 - 112:17)
mime in area one it was just Mr mime was (112:15 - 112:20)
here do you want to catch them cool uh I (112:17 - 112:21)
mean yeah I think I think we have to (112:20 - 112:24)
consider is if you can do (112:21 - 112:27)
if you can truly do (112:24 - 112:31)
any gym in any order we need to discuss (112:27 - 112:35)
what our order of gyms are going to be (112:31 - 112:38)
yeah do if if I'm assuming the grass gym (112:35 - 112:39)
is first (112:38 - 112:42)
if we skip it first if they say it's (112:39 - 112:45)
open world what does first mean like we (112:42 - 112:48)
there's a lot about what they are (112:45 - 112:49)
planning to do that we do not have (112:48 - 112:52)
structural anything for (112:49 - 112:55)
like if it's truly the levels of the gym (112:52 - 112:57)
and the levels in the world change as (112:55 - 112:59)
you do each gym and you can go to any of (112:57 - 113:01)
them then we need to sit down and (112:59 - 113:04)
discuss what gym are we or which means (113:01 - 113:07)
we kind of have to know (113:04 - 113:11)
what's in the game before we do this (113:07 - 113:13)
yeah like okay so we know there are (113:11 - 113:17)
three Gym Leaders if if uh you know I do (113:13 - 113:19)
grusha first (113:17 - 113:22)
want can I do grocer first right is is (113:19 - 113:26)
Russia level 17 or 18 because I have no (113:22 - 113:28)
gym badges or is Russia level 40 because (113:26 - 113:31)
I have three Gym badges (113:28 - 113:34)
um if I do Russia first and (113:31 - 113:37)
Greg does iono first (113:34 - 113:40)
like that seems weird because I'll be (113:37 - 113:41)
like oh well this is the Pokemon that (113:40 - 113:43)
Russia had and you'd be like this is the (113:41 - 113:46)
Pokemon Yona had and like uh okay yeah I (113:43 - 113:48)
mean (113:46 - 113:50)
open world games are hard to do so like (113:48 - 113:53)
we will I again I want to do a series (113:50 - 113:55)
for it but we would we seriously need to (113:53 - 113:57)
sit down and know (113:55 - 114:01)
how the game works before we can decide (113:57 - 114:03)
how we're doing a series and maybe we (114:01 - 114:06)
maybe we put it out (114:03 - 114:08)
after we played the game all weekend and (114:06 - 114:10)
have a discussion once we know how the (114:08 - 114:12)
game works right like we get it on (114:10 - 114:15)
Friday we play the game and see what's (114:12 - 114:17)
really up and then we talk about what (114:15 - 114:18)
we're recording schedule is going to be (114:17 - 114:20)
you know I I think I don't know I think (114:18 - 114:22)
the thing guaranteed is we get the game (114:20 - 114:24)
on Friday we put out an episode on (114:22 - 114:26)
Saturday of just First Impressions (114:24 - 114:28)
um I think that's I think that's that's (114:26 - 114:30)
easy to happen and then we'll discuss (114:28 - 114:34)
what's gonna happen after that (114:30 - 114:34)
um (114:34 - 114:38)
uh well Pokemon of the week (114:36 - 114:42)
uh so the last Pokemon of the week I (114:38 - 114:44)
said it shares a type with wheezing it (114:42 - 114:46)
shares a type with Berserker and it was (114:44 - 114:48)
the first Pokemon introduced with that (114:46 - 114:51)
type combination that neither had a mega (114:48 - 114:54)
devil Evolution nor was a mythical (114:51 - 114:57)
uh and it has become recently become (114:54 - 114:59)
much easier to find tank thanks to tiles (114:57 - 115:01)
and air tags (114:59 - 115:04)
so easy (115:01 - 115:04)
yeah (115:04 - 115:07)
I don't know what that's what I gotta (115:06 - 115:09)
remember writing it down tiles and air (115:07 - 115:13)
tags we had this whole discussion Greg (115:09 - 115:15)
dude (115:13 - 115:19)
it's palpato (115:15 - 115:19)
uh it's pelder and Magnemite (115:24 - 115:29)
no (115:27 - 115:31)
why did why do you use tiles and air (115:29 - 115:33)
tags for (115:31 - 115:36)
finding things finding what finding (115:33 - 115:38)
unknown luggage (115:36 - 115:40)
finding my phone (115:38 - 115:43)
no finding Russia please you put him on (115:40 - 115:45)
your oh that's right that's pretty (115:43 - 115:48)
clever wait we still on cleft key it is (115:45 - 115:52)
still I haven't been around I had that (115:48 - 115:53)
down and I'm like and then I said don't (115:52 - 115:55)
be an owl and you're supposed to (115:53 - 115:57)
remember that that was (115:55 - 116:00)
the episode with ow (115:57 - 116:02)
I that was three episodes ago I thought (116:00 - 116:04)
there was one in between I'm like well (116:02 - 116:06)
we did no I haven't been here (116:04 - 116:10)
look I don't have memory (116:06 - 116:10)
ah (116:10 - 116:14)
traffic is cute and cleft key has no (116:12 - 116:16)
trivia besides it was designed by a (116:14 - 116:19)
person who designed Victini and some (116:16 - 116:21)
Fisk (116:19 - 116:23)
quality design right there (116:21 - 116:26)
a wedding designer I mean I have a shiny (116:23 - 116:29)
yes it does it's cute just cleverly have (116:26 - 116:32)
a shuffle yes it does it's also cute (116:29 - 116:35)
here's a here's a question (116:32 - 116:37)
the cleft case only come into existence (116:35 - 116:40)
once doors with locks (116:37 - 116:43)
were created or were clef keys are (116:40 - 116:44)
different do they carry a different (116:43 - 116:47)
thing around (116:44 - 116:47)
klefki is the biggest (116:47 - 116:55)
miss that the Pokemon company has made (116:52 - 116:59)
what and the reason why is because they (116:55 - 117:01)
could have (116:59 - 117:05)
taken the Four Keys and just randomized (117:01 - 117:06)
the order (117:05 - 117:09)
or or had like five keys total and it (117:06 - 117:12)
was a randomized why do we have (117:09 - 117:16)
2.73 billion spindas (117:12 - 117:16)
we got like now eight for fruits we got (117:26 - 117:34)
like 20 vivions you have a potential to (117:31 - 117:36)
customize a key ring and they're like (117:34 - 117:38)
not just the same four keys in the same (117:36 - 117:40)
four order that you either had (117:38 - 117:43)
multi-color flabebe or keys on a cleft (117:40 - 117:45)
key and they went with the flabebe (117:43 - 117:46)
flowers yeah I mean the flood baby I (117:45 - 117:48)
like the multi-color flavor baby don't (117:46 - 117:50)
get me wrong there but like (117:48 - 117:51)
ah (117:50 - 117:53)
I I can't look at Club key without (117:51 - 117:54)
getting mad about like not having (117:53 - 117:57)
different keys on it all right this (117:54 - 117:58)
week's it makes me so angry I can't (117:57 - 118:00)
sleep at night this week's because you'd (117:58 - 118:02)
be shining hunting every single one of (118:00 - 118:05)
those keys this speaks Pokemon taken (118:02 - 118:08)
from the October issue of Pokemon (118:05 - 118:10)
Journal (118:08 - 118:13)
as we settle into October yarn crafting (118:10 - 118:16)
season is fully upon us the world of (118:13 - 118:19)
yarn is full of confusion and mystery (118:16 - 118:21)
did you know (118:19 - 118:24)
Angora wool comes from rabbits (118:21 - 118:29)
mohair wool comes from Angora goats (118:24 - 118:33)
cashmere comes from goats not sheep (118:29 - 118:36)
yarn produced in Kalos which is only (118:33 - 118:38)
taken when the creature is fully grown (118:36 - 118:41)
is considered a plant-based fiber more (118:38 - 118:46)
similar to Bamboo and cotton than wool (118:41 - 118:47)
Kirby (118:46 - 118:51)
yes Kirby (118:47 - 118:51)
uh thanks for listening thanks for (118:51 - 118:56)
making it to the end uh I will be (118:53 - 118:58)
streaming on Twitch this week I'm back (118:56 - 119:01)

very tired (119:14 - 119:17)

I think there are some exciting things (119:17 - 119:21)
coming this week uh uh I can't (119:19 - 119:23)
specifically say because of embargo (119:21 - 119:26)
purposes but uh keep your eyes out (119:23 - 119:31)
for maybe uh a Friday or or so (119:26 - 119:33)
uh who knows I don't know you know (119:31 - 119:36)
things change embargoes change uh times (119:33 - 119:38)
change the amount of things that Niantic (119:36 - 119:40)
has told me and then last minute was (119:38 - 119:42)
like nope never mind never mind (119:40 - 119:44)
they're pretty good at doing that it's (119:42 - 119:47)
not Niantic related though I promise (119:44 - 119:47)
um (119:47 - 119:51)

think next episode just as exciting uh (119:56 - 120:00)
because we have something in the works (119:59 - 120:02)
uh and then I think we have a guest (120:00 - 120:03)
person for The Following episode which (120:02 - 120:05)
is also excited because we haven't had a (120:03 - 120:07)

scarlet and violet minus the TM machine (121:08 - 121:12)
everything else exciting TM machine no (121:10 - 121:15)
why has the TM machine gave hot dogs (121:12 - 121:16)
back it (121:15 - 121:19)
what if the TM machine turned your (121:16 - 121:21)
sandwiches into hospital so then now you (121:19 - 121:22)
were making hot dogs instead of (121:21 - 121:24)
sandwiches definitely back in our hot (121:22 - 121:27)
dogs tacos (121:24 - 121:27)
um you know according to the state of (121:27 - 121:31)
New York uh I don't care about New York (121:29 - 121:34)
it's classified as a sandwich all you're (121:31 - 121:35)
