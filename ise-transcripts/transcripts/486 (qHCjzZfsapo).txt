pokemon paraphernalia around my (2:19 - 2:22)
childhood bedroom if you're watching the (2:21 - 2:25)
youtube video version of this (2:22 - 2:28)

things about them and they go in one ear (2:29 - 2:32)
and out the other so (2:31 - 2:35)
um ready to hear and ready to hear ready (2:32 - 2:37)

we got we got news (2:46 - 2:48)
there's a (2:47 - 2:51)
pokemon go thing that already passed (2:48 - 2:53)
if you read my youtube comments i also (2:51 - 2:54)
don't know anything about pokemon this (2:53 - 2:56)
is (2:54 - 2:56)
so you're in the right place (2:56 - 3:00)
where do we want to start um let's start (2:58 - 3:02)
with the (3:00 - 3:05)
pokemon go news (3:02 - 3:07)
my boy (3:05 - 3:08)
not cram because when i said my boy was (3:07 - 3:10)
added to the game i read i was like oh (3:08 - 3:11)
they had a crammer app yeah you can't (3:10 - 3:13)
say that because you cannot claim this (3:11 - 3:17)
one as your boy what ah didn't a arrives (3:13 - 3:18)
in the pokemon go (3:17 - 3:20)
uh (3:18 - 3:24)
festival of lights event (3:20 - 3:25)
so um (3:24 - 3:29)
yeah that started on friday november 5th (3:25 - 3:32)
it goes until sunday november (3:29 - 3:34)
didn't he cannot be shiny he just shows (3:32 - 3:36)
up he's not terribly rare if you don't (3:34 - 3:38)
know anything about the detonate he's an (3:36 - 3:40)
electric fairy type pokemon (3:38 - 3:42)
debuted in gen seven (3:40 - 3:44)
six (3:42 - 3:45)
six (3:44 - 3:47)
see don't know anything about pokemon (3:45 - 3:49)
seven was together (3:47 - 3:51)
i'm just nodding every time you say (3:49 - 3:52)
something and i'm like yup gen seven yup (3:51 - 3:55)
john cena definitely (3:52 - 3:58)
kobalian trackian verizion uh ever (3:55 - 4:01)
returned to raids (3:58 - 4:02)
i (4:01 - 4:04)
for whatever reason they're saying if (4:02 - 4:05)
you're lucky you might find shiny (4:04 - 4:06)
charmander (4:05 - 4:08)
vulpix alolan raichu electabuzz magmar (4:06 - 4:09)
chinchou (4:08 - 4:11)
megaminetric (4:09 - 4:13)
um (4:11 - 4:15)
but those could always be shiny i don't (4:13 - 4:16)
know why they're pointing it out again (4:15 - 4:17)
maybe because (4:16 - 4:19)
i don't know people forget maybe because (4:17 - 4:21)
there are (4:19 - 4:23)
less pokemon that can be shiny that (4:21 - 4:25)
versus the amount of pokemon that could (4:23 - 4:27)
be shiny steve i think they just really (4:25 - 4:28)
needed to make sure that you knew that (4:27 - 4:31)
chinchou can be shiny in pokemon go (4:28 - 4:32)
yeah (4:31 - 4:34)
also they just are confirming (4:32 - 4:36)
they've been confirming like this for a (4:34 - 4:38)
while i mean we we are not gonna knock (4:36 - 4:39)
them (4:38 - 4:42)
for actually communicating for once like (4:39 - 4:45)
i'm not gonna hold this against them (4:42 - 4:46)
okay i'll hold everything else against (4:45 - 4:49)
them but not this (4:46 - 4:49)
there's also um (4:49 - 4:53)
double friendship bonus (4:51 - 4:56)
so if you're in a situation where your (4:53 - 5:00)
friend has two more hearts to get to the (4:56 - 5:02)
next level and you know that they don't (5:00 - 5:04)
want to send you a gift because then you (5:02 - 5:06)
will hold on to their gift and then (5:04 - 5:08)
you'll force the open (5:06 - 5:10)
now you can just open the gift and (5:08 - 5:12)
you'll get two instead of one which i've (5:10 - 5:13)
done to a bunch of people because they (5:12 - 5:14)
put me in this (5:13 - 5:17)
situation and i'm like my time is now (5:14 - 5:19)
lucky egg you've sat on this for six (5:17 - 5:22)
months this is your fault (5:19 - 5:24)
um so open all your gifts and send as (5:22 - 5:27)
many gifts as possible because uh if you (5:24 - 5:29)
are still in the mu quest if you're (5:27 - 5:30)
still trying to level up (5:29 - 5:33)
i mean like the friendship stuff is (5:30 - 5:36)
the best way to get experience for doing (5:33 - 5:38)
little to nothing i don't know do it (5:36 - 5:41)
while you're in the bathtub or something (5:38 - 5:42)
i mean (5:41 - 5:45)
it takes so long to do i have to set (5:42 - 5:46)
aside half an hour when i'm like okay i (5:45 - 5:49)
just wanna i wanna sit down and manage (5:46 - 5:52)
my inventory for half an hour on my (5:49 - 5:53)
mobile game (5:52 - 5:55)
and i never make anybody happy because (5:53 - 5:57)
they're like you haven't opened my gift (5:55 - 5:58)
and i'm like gee (5:57 - 6:01)
i have 200 people in this list (5:58 - 6:03)
all who are saying i haven't opened (6:01 - 6:06)
their gift i can't open all of them i go (6:03 - 6:08)
in a very specific order if you reach (6:06 - 6:09)
out to me and say i really need (6:08 - 6:11)
something i will try to find you but (6:09 - 6:13)
also you don't name yourselves the way (6:11 - 6:16)
you name yourselves in real life i don't (6:13 - 6:18)
know who half these people are (6:16 - 6:23)
like give me a clue keep it consistent (6:18 - 6:24)
it's madness (6:23 - 6:25)
greg (6:24 - 6:27)
niantic was listening (6:25 - 6:28)
they were like (6:27 - 6:31)
you're right greg the friends-less (6:28 - 6:34)
complete mess the time commitment awful (6:31 - 6:36)
so what they'll do for you (6:34 - 6:38)
is they will shut down harry potter (6:36 - 6:41)
wizards unite so you have to (6:38 - 6:43)
play (6:41 - 6:46)
to manage your friends list (6:43 - 6:46)
did i have any friends in harry potter (6:47 - 6:51)
wizards tonight (6:50 - 6:53)
i think the answer is no (6:51 - 6:56)
because i played it for a day (6:53 - 6:58)
what they're really doing is making (6:56 - 7:00)
space for you to download pikmin bloom i (6:58 - 7:01)
already have pikmin bloom and again so (7:00 - 7:03)

me greg you can eat and walk it's it's a (7:32 - 7:35)
good (7:34 - 7:37)

they have boosted rewards (8:37 - 8:43)
and reduce potion brew times and there (8:40 - 8:44)

um so i (8:57 - 9:01)
from what i read they're completing the (8:59 - 9:02)
story (9:01 - 9:05)
i didn't know that game had a story but (9:02 - 9:07)
uh that's happening (9:05 - 9:08)
so the the reason we're talking about (9:07 - 9:10)
harry potter also before we go too in (9:08 - 9:12)
depth uh pengu did you play harry potter (9:10 - 9:14)
wizards tonight i did not know i didn't (9:12 - 9:17)
even play pokemon go until a year ago so (9:14 - 9:18)
noob newbie these are good choices (9:17 - 9:21)
educate me these are very good choices (9:18 - 9:23)
with your life i approve (9:21 - 9:25)
uh greg why did you not like harry (9:23 - 9:27)
potter wizards tonight (9:25 - 9:28)
so (9:27 - 9:29)
cause you're a harry potter fan are you (9:28 - 9:31)
not yeah (9:29 - 9:32)
well maybe you were until a certain (9:31 - 9:35)
point in time yeah we're gonna we're i'm (9:32 - 9:37)
slowly pat (9:35 - 9:39)
walking away from harry potter and (9:37 - 9:42)
anything that i liked about it uh (9:39 - 9:44)
the collection part of harry potter (9:42 - 9:45)
unite never made sense for the harry (9:44 - 9:48)
potter (9:45 - 9:48)
story like harry potter itself isn't (9:48 - 9:52)
about (9:51 - 9:54)
collecting things (9:52 - 9:56)
and so that felt tagged on like it was (9:54 - 9:58)
just like oh hey this is this worked and (9:56 - 10:00)
go so you'll collect things in harry (9:58 - 10:03)
potter and the other part is the spells (10:00 - 10:06)
were really complicated like to do the (10:03 - 10:07)
good things you had to like stop and (10:06 - 10:08)
really (10:07 - 10:11)
do the things in the right order or you (10:08 - 10:13)
know and it was hard to do while walking (10:11 - 10:15)
to be like oh i have to do this spell (10:13 - 10:18)
and you could if you got really good at (10:15 - 10:19)
it i suppose you could do it with one (10:18 - 10:21)
hand and keep moving but (10:19 - 10:24)
that learning curve for me was like i (10:21 - 10:27)
don't care enough to get this skill down (10:24 - 10:30)
this isn't a skill that i want (10:27 - 10:34)
the storyline was okay it just did it (10:30 - 10:36)
felt (10:34 - 10:36)
like (10:37 - 10:41)
harry potter adjacent like what you want (10:39 - 10:43)
from harry potter is to like (10:41 - 10:47)
cast spells and fight off eel and (10:43 - 10:50)
it's like okay you kind of do that but (10:47 - 10:51)
also you collect things and that's the (10:50 - 10:54)
main point and (10:51 - 10:55)
have fun (10:54 - 10:57)
and it just never grabbed me it's just (10:55 - 10:59)
like this is this is nothing that i want (10:57 - 11:02)
out of this game (10:59 - 11:02)
and it's too complicated to walk and (11:02 - 11:06)
play like i felt like i had to dedicate (11:04 - 11:09)
a lot of my time to paying attention to (11:06 - 11:11)
the game where i don't feel that way (11:09 - 11:13)
with pokemon go and i really don't feel (11:11 - 11:15)
that way with beekman (11:13 - 11:16)
this is this is the best way i could sum (11:15 - 11:19)
up how i feel about harry potter wizards (11:16 - 11:22)
unite when you're you're so imagine (11:19 - 11:25)
going into like a legendary raid (11:22 - 11:26)
not with 20 people maybe with like four (11:25 - 11:28)
or five people so it takes you like two (11:26 - 11:30)
minutes to do it (11:28 - 11:31)
and then (11:30 - 11:34)
and so everyone's been in that situation (11:31 - 11:35)
you're like oh this took forever we (11:34 - 11:37)
finally did it we had a couple seconds (11:35 - 11:40)
left now imagine that you're the person (11:37 - 11:42)
that it takes all like 20 balls to catch (11:40 - 11:44)
the pokemon (11:42 - 11:45)
and then think about that entire (11:44 - 11:49)
interaction of like i spent so much time (11:45 - 11:50)
doing this raid which was me not even (11:49 - 11:52)
looking at the screen just tapping and (11:50 - 11:53)
then (11:52 - 11:55)
getting frustrated that it just took so (11:53 - 11:57)
many pokeballs to catch (11:55 - 12:00)
uh darkrai or whatever (11:57 - 12:02)
that felt like every interaction in (12:00 - 12:04)
harry potter like it just felt (12:02 - 12:06)
way too long (12:04 - 12:08)
um (12:06 - 12:08)
not saying that like oh every pokemon (12:09 - 12:12)
should just catch it in one ball and (12:10 - 12:14)
move on like i'm not saying that that (12:12 - 12:16)
would be the dream (12:14 - 12:18)
god this guy the ketchup (12:16 - 12:19)
garbage (12:18 - 12:21)
um (12:19 - 12:21)
so (12:21 - 12:23)
the main reason i wanted to bring up the (12:21 - 12:25)
harry potter is one it's made by niantic (12:23 - 12:28)
who does make pokemon go uh and two i (12:25 - 12:30)
think there was like some concern i i (12:28 - 12:34)
don't know i think this the complaint of (12:30 - 12:35)
well this is why i don't give mobile (12:34 - 12:37)
games money because they can disappear (12:35 - 12:39)
it's kind of a weird complaint (12:37 - 12:40)
because like (12:39 - 12:43)
when i think about (12:40 - 12:44)
i think i gave harry potter like five (12:43 - 12:46)
bucks or something they had like a (12:44 - 12:49)
starter welcome kit or something (12:46 - 12:51)
of the sort and i gave it five bucks and (12:49 - 12:52)
i think i played harry potter for like (12:51 - 12:53)
four or five days and now that it's (12:52 - 12:56)
shutting down i don't feel like man wha (12:53 - 12:58)
that five dollars is like like i think (12:56 - 13:00)
of going to a movie and spending 15 (12:58 - 13:03)
bucks and being like yup i gave that (13:00 - 13:06)
movie 15 i enjoyed my hour and a half (13:03 - 13:08)
and i moved on and so if pokemon go was (13:06 - 13:10)
ever to shut down because this is what (13:08 - 13:12)
people were thinking of like oh like if (13:10 - 13:14)
i gave up pokemon go a hundred dollars (13:12 - 13:16)
in five years i'm not thinking like oh (13:14 - 13:19)
that 100 is gone i'm thinking that i (13:16 - 13:20)
i'm thinking in the sense of like a (13:19 - 13:22)
movie ticket almost (13:20 - 13:24)
well yeah it's the conversation of (13:22 - 13:26)
you're paying for an experience and not (13:24 - 13:28)
for an actual thing that you will own (13:26 - 13:31)
forever so i don't know i mean i get it (13:28 - 13:34)
but i also think (13:31 - 13:36)
the the expectations of purchasing (13:34 - 13:38)
something in a game (13:36 - 13:40)
are different than (13:38 - 13:42)
purchasing something to just observe (13:40 - 13:44)
they don't (13:42 - 13:46)
sell these micro transactions they don't (13:44 - 13:50)
sell them as temporary items they are (13:46 - 13:52)
selling you as things you get to keep as (13:50 - 13:55)
additions to your game so the basis of (13:52 - 13:58)
that thought process is very different i (13:55 - 14:01)
know going in to a movie i am renting (13:58 - 14:03)
their space for the amount of time it (14:01 - 14:04)
takes (14:03 - 14:06)
to watch that movie i know i am not (14:04 - 14:09)
taking anything away out with me i may (14:06 - 14:12)
sneak my 3d glasses into my pocket and (14:09 - 14:13)
like heck no i paid for these and you (14:12 - 14:15)
don't get to recycle them (14:13 - 14:18)
but the expectation of (14:15 - 14:21)
of like a performance is i am (14:18 - 14:23)
i am paying for that experience which is (14:21 - 14:25)
a very different thing than how they (14:23 - 14:26)
sell these games (14:25 - 14:28)
games have always traditionally been (14:26 - 14:30)
sold as you get to keep this thing you (14:28 - 14:33)
get to use this thing multiple times (14:30 - 14:36)
this is a part to enhance your game (14:33 - 14:38)
there is a sense of ownership that they (14:36 - 14:40)
really rely on to get you to buy these (14:38 - 14:44)
things where other media doesn't do that (14:40 - 14:46)
but it's the same process of (14:44 - 14:49)
why i still buy music (14:46 - 14:51)
because i want to own that thing and i (14:49 - 14:54)
don't want a company to some point say (14:51 - 14:55)
we don't like that artist anymore and (14:54 - 14:57)
we're moving your access to this music (14:55 - 14:59)
which is a real thing (14:57 - 15:01)
like their spotify has lost a ton of (14:59 - 15:03)
artists where i'm very happy that i kept (15:01 - 15:06)
their music so that i get to keep it (15:03 - 15:07)
after (15:06 - 15:08)
so there is a sense in this very new (15:07 - 15:11)
digital world of (15:08 - 15:13)
i want to be able to keep this thing (15:11 - 15:15)
you've sold this as an enhancement to my (15:13 - 15:18)
game and to my experience (15:15 - 15:20)
and you're going to arbitrarily take (15:18 - 15:21)
that away from me because you shut it (15:20 - 15:23)
down or you didn't think it was worth it (15:21 - 15:25)
anymore (15:23 - 15:27)
it's a very different presentation then (15:25 - 15:30)
i'm going to go and experience something (15:27 - 15:32)
there is an experiential part and if (15:30 - 15:34)
they sold it that way (15:32 - 15:36)
i guarantee they would get less money (15:34 - 15:38)
they very much rely on you thinking (15:36 - 15:40)
you're owning (15:38 - 15:40)
this (15:40 - 15:42)
and ignoring the fact that they rip it (15:40 - 15:44)
from you at any moment (15:42 - 15:47)
yeah i guess i think of it in the in the (15:44 - 15:48)
entertainment part like i'm getting (15:47 - 15:50)
entertained for 90 minutes and then (15:48 - 15:52)
pokemon go or (15:50 - 15:54)
i don't know maybe harry potter people (15:52 - 15:55)
feel like this i'm getting entertained (15:54 - 15:57)
an hour a day (15:55 - 16:01)
and if i want to do a community day i am (15:57 - 16:04)
paying 99 cents or i'm paying (16:01 - 16:06)
9.99 whatever you decide if you want to (16:04 - 16:10)
spend money for that six hours (16:06 - 16:12)
um (16:10 - 16:12)
but like with pokemon go if you're you (16:13 - 16:17)
know paying for raid passes or paying (16:15 - 16:18)
for pokeballs you you use your 100 (16:17 - 16:21)
pokeballs and then they're they're gone (16:18 - 16:22)
like they're not a thing that you're (16:21 - 16:23)
expected to keep and if you're paying (16:22 - 16:25)
for raid passes you get your legend if (16:23 - 16:26)
pokemon go shuts down they give you like (16:25 - 16:28)
a three-month warning and you you move (16:26 - 16:30)
it into home and you still get to keep (16:28 - 16:33)
it so yeah (16:30 - 16:35)
keeping in mind that you know people are (16:33 - 16:38)
worried about bank right like (16:35 - 16:39)
the good thing the way that nintendo (16:38 - 16:42)
does do this well is they do give you (16:39 - 16:43)
plenty of warning to say if you want to (16:42 - 16:45)
keep these digital things (16:43 - 16:47)
move with you but steve look at your (16:45 - 16:49)
destiny thing (16:47 - 16:50)
how much how mad were you when they took (16:49 - 16:52)
all your destiny stuff away (16:50 - 16:55)
um i was i was mad in that situation (16:52 - 16:57)
because they they sold it as a tenure (16:55 - 16:59)
game and when they go when they when (16:57 - 17:01)
they pitch a game called destiny one and (16:59 - 17:03)
they go oh this one's destiny two you're (17:01 - 17:05)
like well this is part of the 10 year (17:03 - 17:07)
life cycle (17:05 - 17:09)
i think it's easy for (17:07 - 17:11)
harry potter fans or just maybe the (17:09 - 17:12)
pokemon go community who didn't play (17:11 - 17:14)
harry potter to go like well at least we (17:12 - 17:16)
can transfer our pokemon because there's (17:14 - 17:17)
not a lot of games that have that (17:16 - 17:19)
expectation like (17:17 - 17:21)
like what were you going to do with your (17:19 - 17:23)
if harry potter wizards unite lasted 10 (17:21 - 17:25)
years (17:23 - 17:26)
what did you (17:25 - 17:28)
what was your end goal like what did you (17:26 - 17:31)
plan to keep or move like pokemon is in (17:28 - 17:34)
a very unique spot in the sense that (17:31 - 17:38)
they try to let you move pokemon over (17:34 - 17:40)
and the fact that go has compatibility (17:38 - 17:41)
with bank is already (17:40 - 17:44)
kind of not above and beyond but some (17:41 - 17:45)
people never thought it was going to (17:44 - 17:48)
come um (17:45 - 17:49)
but then i think about like games of (17:48 - 17:51)
like world of warcraft like (17:49 - 17:54)
that ends at some point doesn't it (17:51 - 17:56)
it hasn't yet (17:54 - 17:59)
as much as people want it to no like (17:56 - 18:01)
but that's also the same reason why i (17:59 - 18:03)
don't buy (18:01 - 18:05)
many cosmetics or things for in those (18:03 - 18:06)
games either (18:05 - 18:10)
because i i fundamentally know that that (18:06 - 18:13)
is a dead end that at some point (18:10 - 18:15)
i will leave this behind and i have (18:13 - 18:19)
spent literally money on nothing (18:15 - 18:19)
yeah there's um (18:20 - 18:25)
there's like the battle pass and unite (18:24 - 18:27)
we have no unite news united isn't an (18:25 - 18:30)
awful place right now for the record (18:27 - 18:32)
there's like this real thing the past is (18:30 - 18:33)
ending early (18:32 - 18:35)
yeah it ends on (18:33 - 18:37)
it's supposed to end on tuesday night (18:35 - 18:38)
but it's ending like tuesday morning (18:37 - 18:41)
because yeah maintenance i think (18:38 - 18:41)
you yeah (18:41 - 18:43)
it's gonna not i we can't go down to (18:41 - 18:44)
unite the whole we don't have enough (18:43 - 18:46)
time but anyways there's this weird (18:44 - 18:47)
thing where (18:46 - 18:49)
where there people are sending three (18:47 - 18:51)
pokemon to bottom lane and one pokemon (18:49 - 18:52)
the top lane the pokemon they're sending (18:51 - 18:54)
the top lane is lucario because lucario (18:52 - 18:56)
is so good they can solo top lane so if (18:54 - 18:58)
you look at like a lot of high ranked (18:56 - 18:59)
competitive matches it's just lucario (18:58 - 19:01)
versus lucario on the top and then six (18:59 - 19:03)
pokemon in the bottom and then (19:01 - 19:06)
the two pokemon in the jungle it's awful (19:03 - 19:08)
it's really bad but (19:06 - 19:10)
the battle pass is ending soon (19:08 - 19:11)
and i haven't played a lot of unite this (19:10 - 19:13)
season one because of what i've just (19:11 - 19:15)
explained two because i've been moving (19:13 - 19:17)
um (19:15 - 19:19)
and i'm thinking like do i pay the money (19:17 - 19:21)
to extend the battle pass to get the (19:19 - 19:23)
gengar skin (19:21 - 19:26)
uh which is a really cool skin (19:23 - 19:28)
and i get all the clothes along the way (19:26 - 19:30)
and then i think to myself (19:28 - 19:32)
i'm never gonna wear those clothes (19:30 - 19:33)
because i spent twenty dollars on the (19:32 - 19:35)
cramer ant clothes and i'm going to wake (19:33 - 19:38)
up (19:35 - 19:38)
i don't play gengar but this goes back (19:42 - 19:46)
to the pokemon go harry potter thing of (19:44 - 19:48)
like (19:46 - 19:49)
oh i put this money into the game the (19:48 - 19:51)
game is now closing like i don't expect (19:49 - 19:53)
unite to last forever (19:51 - 19:56)
and i also don't expect to ever wear (19:53 - 19:58)
99 of the clothes i get in the battle (19:56 - 20:00)
pass (19:58 - 20:02)
they exist they're there (20:00 - 20:04)
um (20:02 - 20:05)
so i (20:04 - 20:07)
i don't think i'm going to complete the (20:05 - 20:09)
battle pass with my money (20:07 - 20:12)
uh but i don't know there's like i i (20:09 - 20:14)
guess i'm very glad that destiny thing (20:12 - 20:15)
happened to me where i collected (20:14 - 20:17)
everything in destiny 1 i spent all the (20:15 - 20:19)
money in destiny 1 i spent hours getting (20:17 - 20:21)
an emblem i would never equipped just (20:19 - 20:23)
because it was missing a hole in my (20:21 - 20:24)
collection and when they were like none (20:23 - 20:26)
of this transfers (20:24 - 20:29)
i i am broken inside where i cannot do (20:26 - 20:31)
this for another game i just (20:29 - 20:33)
because it with unite i was like oh i (20:31 - 20:34)
like i like all the clothes in the (20:33 - 20:36)
united i like all the costumes in united (20:34 - 20:38)
i like unite i would like to collect (20:36 - 20:40)
everything (20:38 - 20:42)
but also unite is not going to last 20 (20:40 - 20:44)
years (20:42 - 20:46)
i don't know maybe so many times stamped (20:44 - 20:48)
this in 20 years of playing unite (20:46 - 20:50)
lucario's still is the top five years (20:48 - 20:52)
it's gonna be wild (20:50 - 20:54)
yeah i think i'm just gonna keep on (20:52 - 20:56)
being devil's advocate here but like (20:54 - 20:57)
even if you did keep it and destiny one (20:56 - 20:59)
was still a thing and you got all your (20:57 - 21:01)
thing but you like moved on to destiny 2 (20:59 - 21:02)
how often are you like going back to (21:01 - 21:03)
look at everything that you have (21:02 - 21:05)
collected in this game even if it was (21:03 - 21:07)
still around (21:05 - 21:09)
um that's a good point i think for i (21:07 - 21:11)
think i still wouldn't like equipped it (21:09 - 21:13)
or use it but um (21:11 - 21:15)
like with pokemon home i like seeing (21:13 - 21:18)
that oh i filled out this collection (21:15 - 21:20)
and so when i'm adding new things to the (21:18 - 21:21)
collection that's when i look at the old (21:20 - 21:24)
collection i go yeah i did that (21:21 - 21:26)
even though i'm not like withdrawing (21:24 - 21:28)
that like sun kern (21:26 - 21:30)
it's like you stay there it's fine i (21:28 - 21:31)
caught you (21:30 - 21:35)
you exist in this box forever (21:31 - 21:35)
it's all silly (21:38 - 21:41)
like i again like i paid 20 for unite to (21:41 - 21:47)
get money in there that's all the money (21:45 - 21:48)
i'll ever put in because i thought it (21:47 - 21:51)
was worth a 20 game if i had walked into (21:48 - 21:53)
target and had to buy the game for 20 (21:51 - 21:55)
bucks i would have been happy with that (21:53 - 21:56)
purchase (21:55 - 21:59)
anything beyond that is just (21:56 - 22:02)
to me at this point in my life pointless (21:59 - 22:04)
i don't need virtual anything i don't (22:02 - 22:05)
need to (22:04 - 22:07)
pretend that anybody cares about my (22:05 - 22:09)
achievements online achievements have (22:07 - 22:12)
never meant anything to me i've never (22:09 - 22:13)
cared if somebody gave me a sticker i (22:12 - 22:15)
don't care if somebody recognizes me for (22:13 - 22:17)
things that i do (22:15 - 22:18)
if you're going to recognize me for (22:17 - 22:20)
something give me money for it so i can (22:18 - 22:23)
buy something that i want otherwise like (22:20 - 22:25)
your words (22:23 - 22:28)
useless to me in most cases i like (22:25 - 22:30)
hearing that you enjoy my things but if (22:28 - 22:32)
like your sole recognition of me (22:30 - 22:35)
is a metal (22:32 - 22:37)
nah i'm a good i don't i don't need the (22:35 - 22:41)
metal or the sticker or the little block (22:37 - 22:42)
that meddles and hundreds of other (22:41 - 22:45)
people can get for doing (22:42 - 22:47)
minimal amount of work like if everybody (22:45 - 22:49)
can get this the same achievement that (22:47 - 22:51)
achievement is (22:49 - 22:53)
useless to (22:51 - 22:53)
i me (22:54 - 22:56)
achievement still (22:54 - 22:58)
i clearly am not a person who likes (22:56 - 23:00)
medals at all (22:58 - 23:03)
i'm pointing in the youtube video (23:00 - 23:06)
i have one i won a thing (23:03 - 23:07)
congrats (23:06 - 23:09)
this one is because you know it's an (23:07 - 23:11)
actual award that carried a bunch of (23:09 - 23:13)
stuff with it (23:11 - 23:16)
that and you're saying mine aren't rude (23:13 - 23:16)
no (23:16 - 23:18)
i'm saying getting as human saying i've (23:16 - 23:20)
collected in (23:18 - 23:23)
15 of grass types in pokemon house so (23:20 - 23:25)
satisfying this (23:23 - 23:30)
i like those medals a lot (23:25 - 23:30)
what was what had the metals in game was (23:30 - 23:33)
that black and white that had the metal (23:32 - 23:35)
mask yes (23:33 - 23:38)
pointless um (23:35 - 23:39)
i think (23:38 - 23:42)
i found that to be pointless because i (23:39 - 23:44)
don't was there was no way to ever see (23:42 - 23:46)
them after you collected them right (23:44 - 23:48)
no there was it was online (23:46 - 23:50)
oh yeah had but not in the game you had (23:48 - 23:52)
to go to a website yeah that was the (23:50 - 23:54)
that was the disconnect for me (23:52 - 23:56)
because i couldn't like like with the (23:54 - 23:57)
gym badges you can open up your profile (23:56 - 23:59)
and you're like oh i got seven out of (23:57 - 24:00)
eight and then you like shine them in (23:59 - 24:02)
some games (24:00 - 24:04)
in one game you could join them in one (24:02 - 24:06)
game and you could try two three diamond (24:04 - 24:09)
pearl platinum one generation one (24:06 - 24:11)
generation hey (24:09 - 24:13)
cause they brought it back (24:11 - 24:15)

myself and will are going to this (26:29 - 26:34)
except there was really a midlife crisis (26:31 - 26:36)
of me being like can we just not go (26:34 - 26:38)
and what did greg is saying we have to (26:36 - 26:39)
go (26:38 - 26:41)
exactly we have to go (26:39 - 26:42)
but do we (26:41 - 26:45)
yes i did not take this time off and (26:42 - 26:48)
vacation and plan on going to a (26:45 - 26:51)
different city for you to be like (26:48 - 26:54)
no we have to go we have like as long as (26:51 - 26:56)
we give the hotel be there (26:54 - 26:58)
24 hours notice we can get our money (26:56 - 27:00)
back no (26:58 - 27:02)
we are going (27:00 - 27:05)
there are eager people willing and happy (27:02 - 27:07)
to meet us okay the real news though is (27:05 - 27:09)
pikmin community day is the saturday (27:07 - 27:11)
we're playing on friday (27:09 - 27:12)
we need to at least walk 10 000 steps (27:11 - 27:15)
before we get back in the car (27:12 - 27:15)
we can do 10 000 steps when we get back (27:16 - 27:20)
home (27:18 - 27:22)
i might be too tired (27:20 - 27:23)
oh are you gonna drive you get to sleep (27:22 - 27:25)
in the back of the car i can't sleep in (27:23 - 27:26)
cars (27:25 - 27:29)
too stressful (27:26 - 27:29)
can we talk about pikmin bloom for a (27:29 - 27:32)
second (27:31 - 27:33)
i don't know what the third one is it (27:32 - 27:35)
was it liverpool (27:33 - 27:37)
yes that's the third event (27:35 - 27:39)
that happened first it was liverpool (27:37 - 27:42)
then pittsburgh then st louis yeah (27:39 - 27:44)
yes (27:42 - 27:47)
pengu tell me about pikmin bloom (27:44 - 27:48)
what do you want to know about pikmin (27:47 - 27:50)
blue i finally downloaded pikmin bloom (27:48 - 27:52)
because you keep tweeting about it and i (27:50 - 27:55)
am very easily influenced apparently (27:52 - 27:57)
that's how we got you on the show (27:55 - 27:59)
apparently i just keep getting reeled in (27:57 - 28:03)
step by step um but i have planted lots (27:59 - 28:05)
of flowers i've been trying to play (28:03 - 28:07)
pikmin bloom while playing pokemon go (28:05 - 28:09)
while running and it's been an adventure (28:07 - 28:11)
um but yeah i've been planting lots of (28:09 - 28:12)
flowers been having lots of fun (28:11 - 28:15)
collecting my little pikmins and like (28:12 - 28:17)
nectaring their heads it took me so long (28:15 - 28:18)
to figure out you didn't have to throw (28:17 - 28:21)
each nectar like a pokeball (28:18 - 28:24)
that's a total game changer (28:21 - 28:25)
hold it and you move it around they jump (28:24 - 28:27)
up and get it okay here's the number one (28:25 - 28:29)
question that i have on twitter (28:27 - 28:33)
about uh pikmin (28:29 - 28:33)
what is going on in this game (28:33 - 28:37)
number one when i said that we want to (28:35 - 28:41)
be my friend everybody said sure (28:37 - 28:44)
what is happening at this game (28:41 - 28:45)
i'm still not entirely sure but it's (28:44 - 28:47)
very cute and there are a lot of glowy (28:45 - 28:49)
flowers and like do you really need more (28:47 - 28:51)
that's enough for me (28:49 - 28:54)
okay so i think i have not looked up (28:51 - 28:57)
anything for pikmin i am sure just like (28:54 - 28:59)
there was an explosion of pokemon go (28:57 - 29:00)
youtubers (28:59 - 29:03)
i am sure there's like two (29:00 - 29:04)
pikmin (29:03 - 29:07)
youtubers that have maybe exploded this (29:04 - 29:08)
is my chance (29:07 - 29:10)
i'm sure there's a subreddit (29:08 - 29:13)
um (29:10 - 29:15)
so from my understanding (29:13 - 29:19)
there is the exploration feature (29:15 - 29:21)
expedition or exploration are those (29:19 - 29:22)
different are there two things they are (29:21 - 29:23)
different (29:22 - 29:26)
they are different so i think the (29:23 - 29:29)
exploration feature is just you (29:26 - 29:30)
is just the community working together (29:29 - 29:33)
to put flowers everywhere so if you look (29:30 - 29:34)
at the map (29:33 - 29:37)
um you'll see where flowers have been (29:34 - 29:39)
even if you haven't planted the flowers (29:37 - 29:41)
yourself you can like zoom out and kind (29:39 - 29:43)
of look at like (29:41 - 29:45)
me would be the twin city area and you (29:43 - 29:48)
can see that there are areas where no (29:45 - 29:50)
one has ever walked or touched flowers (29:48 - 29:52)
and that that will be gray on the map (29:50 - 29:55)
so that's like i think (29:52 - 29:57)
the first part of the game is like can (29:55 - 30:00)
we get the whole world to be flowers um (29:57 - 30:02)
which is obviously a long-term goal (30:00 - 30:03)
and then there's like personal (30:02 - 30:05)
short-term goals of if you go into like (30:03 - 30:07)
the pikmin decks you can get different (30:05 - 30:09)
kind of pikmin so you get like a pikmin (30:07 - 30:11)
that has like a mushroom growing out of (30:09 - 30:13)
his head or you can get a pikmin that (30:11 - 30:15)
has like a boat (30:13 - 30:16)
growing out of his head (30:15 - 30:19)
so there are location-based pikmin (30:16 - 30:21)
and i think those are like not the (30:19 - 30:23)
shinies but like the rare ones of if you (30:21 - 30:25)
use your scanner (30:23 - 30:26)
near a restaurant you might get a (30:25 - 30:28)
restaurant pikmin if you use your (30:26 - 30:30)
scanner near a (30:28 - 30:32)
um a park you might get one of the park (30:30 - 30:34)
pikmin if you use a scanner next to the (30:32 - 30:35)
road you might get one of the road (30:34 - 30:37)
pikmin so there's (30:35 - 30:39)
scanner yeah what's the scanner is that (30:37 - 30:42)
like the item scanner (30:39 - 30:44)
megaphone (30:42 - 30:47)
that is above your flowers (30:44 - 30:49)
it's the little megaphone and when you (30:47 - 30:51)
activate it it has a cool down of like (30:49 - 30:53)
five hours (30:51 - 30:56)
so there's like whistle your planter (30:53 - 30:59)
your flowers and the very top is your oh (30:56 - 31:02)
it's called the detector okay (30:59 - 31:04)
so if i look at the detector right now (31:02 - 31:07)
it's it says there's a place nearby (31:04 - 31:10)
and that place is like a mini mart (31:07 - 31:12)
um but if you go into the pikmin decks (31:10 - 31:14)
which i don't know how to get to right (31:12 - 31:15)
now (31:14 - 31:18)
i think maybe you click on your name (31:15 - 31:19)
oh yeah so you click on your name and (31:18 - 31:21)
then you click on the little pikmin icon (31:19 - 31:22)
so there's (31:21 - 31:24)
a restaurant cafe (31:22 - 31:26)
sweet shop movie theater pharmacy zoo (31:24 - 31:28)
forest (31:26 - 31:29)
so like the forest pikmin they look like (31:28 - 31:31)
little owls (31:29 - 31:33)
and then the waterside (31:31 - 31:36)
post office pikmin (31:33 - 31:37)
art gallery pikmin oh so the art gallery (31:36 - 31:40)
pikmin they look like little pictures (31:37 - 31:40)
so (31:40 - 31:43)
i have like two of these there's a bunch (31:40 - 31:46)
and one they're both roadside pikmin i'm (31:43 - 31:48)
not seeing the scanner thing do i have (31:46 - 31:50)
to like be a level to unlock it you have (31:48 - 31:51)
to be a level to unlock it i think you (31:50 - 31:55)
have to be like level 10. i'm level 11. (31:51 - 31:57)
you have no clue about what levels are i (31:55 - 31:58)
keep telling me oh you'll get these (31:57 - 32:01)
things level 13 and i still don't have (31:58 - 32:02)
the one thing you said i would get at (32:01 - 32:05)
level 10. yeah there are raids (32:02 - 32:06)
um (32:05 - 32:07)
yeah i don't know when you get the (32:06 - 32:10)
scanner thing or the detector (32:07 - 32:11)
wait there are raids is that what the (32:10 - 32:13)
big flowers are (32:11 - 32:15)
no no the big flowers are just big (32:13 - 32:16)
flowers for reason i don't know what (32:15 - 32:18)
those do yet nobody does that's the (32:16 - 32:19)
thing everybody's like what is this game (32:18 - 32:22)
what does it do and it's like no clue (32:19 - 32:25)
there is no internal explanation there (32:22 - 32:27)
are expeditions which are sending your (32:25 - 32:28)
pikmin out to get stuff and then the (32:27 - 32:30)
pikmin will bring that stuff back (32:28 - 32:33)
and then there are um (32:30 - 32:35)
at like six maybe it's like level 16 or (32:33 - 32:36)
something there are different (32:35 - 32:38)
expeditions where you can send your (32:36 - 32:41)
pikmin to like beat up some mushrooms (32:38 - 32:43)
and then it'll say like five people can (32:41 - 32:45)
join you but no one ever joins me and (32:43 - 32:47)
then there's like a countdown (32:45 - 32:50)
like a a raid battle where it'll say (32:47 - 32:51)
like oh it took you five minutes to beat (32:50 - 32:53)
up these mushrooms and it's like well if (32:51 - 32:54)
you had more people you would beat it up (32:53 - 32:56)
faster and then time limit on beating up (32:54 - 32:58)
the mushrooms no you can beat them up (32:56 - 33:01)
forever oh okay (32:58 - 33:01)
so the first time i beat up mushrooms it (33:02 - 33:06)
took like 45 minutes (33:04 - 33:08)
ah you can beat them up forever it's (33:06 - 33:09)
great (33:08 - 33:11)
murder the mushrooms (33:09 - 33:13)
wait one thing unrelated to this but i (33:11 - 33:15)
was looking a little bit on reddit about (33:13 - 33:16)
people playing pikmin bloom and one (33:15 - 33:18)
person said to note that if you send (33:16 - 33:20)
something out on an expedition like it (33:18 - 33:22)
moves in real time um based on like (33:20 - 33:24)
where you are and they said they took a (33:22 - 33:26)
flight across the country and sent a (33:24 - 33:28)
pikmin out on it on an expedition they (33:26 - 33:29)
were like a beta tester and then they (33:28 - 33:31)
went home and the pikmin took 45 days to (33:29 - 33:33)
like walk across the country (33:31 - 33:35)
back to them (33:33 - 33:37)
so like something to keep in mind (33:35 - 33:39)
that poor little pikmin (33:37 - 33:42)
it was it was kind of cool to (33:39 - 33:45)
get to minnesota because i had so many (33:42 - 33:47)
expeditions in milwaukee so i was like (33:45 - 33:48)
sending the pikmin back and i'd be like (33:47 - 33:51)
we'll see you in like six days like okay (33:48 - 33:52)
okay bye little friends (33:51 - 33:55)
see you later uh okay i think it's great (33:52 - 33:57)
though i think it's like the opposite of (33:55 - 34:00)
harry potter like pokemon go was this (33:57 - 34:01)
very (34:00 - 34:03)
you know some people consider pokemon go (34:01 - 34:06)
not a game they're like oh it's just (34:03 - 34:08)
it's boring or it doesn't appeal to me i (34:06 - 34:10)
think pokemon go strikes a pretty good (34:08 - 34:12)
balance of like (34:10 - 34:13)
grabbing your attention for maybe an (34:12 - 34:15)
hour a day and then like (34:13 - 34:17)
unless you're super hardcore you don't (34:15 - 34:18)
really have to pay attention to it and (34:17 - 34:21)
then harry potter was like you want way (34:18 - 34:23)
too much attention and niantic did say (34:21 - 34:25)
that niantic was like harry potter is a (34:23 - 34:27)
more advanced like a hardcore version of (34:25 - 34:30)
pokemon go um and i kind of can see why (34:27 - 34:31)
they said that (34:30 - 34:33)
um but pikmin is like (34:31 - 34:36)
i'm going to start planting flowers i'm (34:33 - 34:37)
going to send them out on expeditions (34:36 - 34:39)
i'm going to feed them nectar (34:37 - 34:41)
and then i'm going to go into target for (34:39 - 34:42)
30 minutes buy a giant twix bar come (34:41 - 34:44)
back out (34:42 - 34:46)
and then in that time (34:44 - 34:48)
i didn't interact with the app but when (34:46 - 34:50)
i get back to my car i felt like i've (34:48 - 34:51)
accomplished a bunch of stuff without (34:50 - 34:53)
having the app constantly open like (34:51 - 34:56)
pokemon go (34:53 - 34:57)
yes but then i don't interact with the (34:56 - 34:59)
app and i come back and 40 of my battery (34:57 - 35:03)
is gone yeah there's that (34:59 - 35:05)
yeah that's true it's really good at (35:03 - 35:07)
just draining your battery yeah i mean (35:05 - 35:09)
the thing is like (35:07 - 35:11)
it's one of the few things that i say it (35:09 - 35:12)
can track me (35:11 - 35:13)
always (35:12 - 35:15)
because if you don't have it on track (35:13 - 35:18)
you always then it is (35:15 - 35:18)
mostly useless like (35:18 - 35:23)
you have to keep it open so it knows (35:21 - 35:25)
where you're going or you have to have (35:23 - 35:27)
it on always either way it's a battery (35:25 - 35:29)
drain so i do hope that they do (35:27 - 35:32)
something to like (35:29 - 35:34)
deal with that issue and make it a (35:32 - 35:35)
little bit later because that was a (35:34 - 35:37)
problem when go first started too if i (35:35 - 35:39)
remember correctly like people were like (35:37 - 35:41)
oh i played pokemon go for half an hour (35:39 - 35:44)
and i literally have to charge my phone (35:41 - 35:46)
yeah i remember that (35:44 - 35:48)
so does it not do anything if you have (35:46 - 35:50)
it uh like location turned off in the (35:48 - 35:51)
background because i turned mine off (35:50 - 35:52)
because my phone kept yelling at me (35:51 - 35:53)
because it was like pikmin keeps (35:52 - 35:55)
checking your location and it's draining (35:53 - 35:56)
all your batteries so i turned it off (35:55 - 35:58)
and like i haven't actually been (35:56 - 36:00)
checking uh how much lower my step (35:58 - 36:02)
counts are but i think it can't i think (36:00 - 36:04)
it will get your step total because the (36:02 - 36:05)
phone will keep your step total but it (36:04 - 36:09)
won't know where you were on your path (36:05 - 36:10)
because it didn't know your location (36:09 - 36:13)
that entire time and since that's part (36:10 - 36:15)
of its thing like fill the world with (36:13 - 36:17)
flowers or whatever we're doing with (36:15 - 36:19)
this game if you have that often it (36:17 - 36:21)
can't track you which means if you want (36:19 - 36:23)
to plant flowers you have to leave it (36:21 - 36:24)
open (36:23 - 36:27)
so that it is always (36:24 - 36:29)
there and it's fine like i don't need it (36:27 - 36:31)
to know where i am but i think it also (36:29 - 36:34)
pulls like we went to (36:31 - 36:36)
dinner the other night over in (36:34 - 36:38)
uh dinky town (36:36 - 36:39)
and i had it (36:38 - 36:41)
tracking over there so it showed that i (36:39 - 36:42)
went all the way to dinking town and (36:41 - 36:44)
then came back to my house and it kept (36:42 - 36:46)
that path if i didn't have that on it (36:44 - 36:48)
had been like you were here then you (36:46 - 36:49)
popped over here and then you popped (36:48 - 36:50)
back (36:49 - 36:52)
so do you keep your flowers planting (36:50 - 36:55)
just all the time in the background (36:52 - 36:56)
i only do it when i'm doing my daily (36:55 - 36:59)
constitutionals okay (36:56 - 37:00)
it took me a lot of time to get those (36:59 - 37:02)
flower petals and i'm not going to waste (37:00 - 37:04)
it by walking around my house but then (37:02 - 37:06)
your house will be filled with flowers (37:04 - 37:07)
my house is filled with flowers my house (37:06 - 37:09)
is definitely filled with flowers it's a (37:07 - 37:10)
haul like looking in the neighborhood (37:09 - 37:12)
and seeing other people's houses filled (37:10 - 37:13)
with flowers which is only one other (37:12 - 37:16)
house like four black stuff oh you go up (37:13 - 37:18)
and down cake you want to be beautiful (37:16 - 37:20)
yeah i was wondering earlier uh when you (37:18 - 37:22)
when you said that you can see everyone (37:20 - 37:22)
else's flowers because that was (37:22 - 37:24)
something i was wondering about because (37:22 - 37:26)
i only see my flowers so clearly i'm the (37:24 - 37:27)
only person in the city playing this (37:26 - 37:29)
game (37:27 - 37:30)
uh yeah you can see other people's (37:29 - 37:31)
flowers there is then we got the dinky (37:30 - 37:33)
town that was the that are that was the (37:31 - 37:35)
very first time i was in dinky town and (37:33 - 37:37)
there were flowers everywhere already (37:35 - 37:38)
well they're college students what else (37:37 - 37:40)
do they get to do by play pikmin play (37:38 - 37:42)
pikmin (37:40 - 37:43)
um (37:42 - 37:45)
yeah pikmin's pretty good i like it a (37:43 - 37:47)
lot i only plant flowers when i like (37:45 - 37:48)
when i know i'm walking so if i'm (37:47 - 37:51)
walking around target or if i'm i've i (37:48 - 37:54)
because of pikmin i like put a scarf on (37:51 - 37:56)
i put a coat on and i was like i need to (37:54 - 37:58)
walk like a mile because i'm so close to (37:56 - 38:00)
the next level and i want to make sure i (37:58 - 38:01)
get my steps in (38:00 - 38:03)
and i ended up walking two miles because (38:01 - 38:04)
i (38:03 - 38:08)
forgot where i lived uh (38:04 - 38:08)
really just (38:09 - 38:13)
walked right past my house and just i (38:10 - 38:15)
was in the zone (38:13 - 38:15)
and all of a sudden i'm like 20 minutes (38:16 - 38:22)
i'm in another neighborhood (38:19 - 38:24)
no this only makes sense because you (38:22 - 38:26)
just moved (38:24 - 38:29)
people that's a brand new house it makes (38:26 - 38:29)
sense (38:29 - 38:31)
but that's the (38:29 - 38:33)
funniest thing i've heard in a while oh (38:31 - 38:35)
my god (38:33 - 38:35)
i was very calm like i'm gonna walk two (38:36 - 38:40)
blocks turn two blocks i'm gonna go to (38:38 - 38:42)
complete square and then after like 20 (38:40 - 38:47)
minutes i'm like oh it never turned (38:42 - 38:47)
[Music] (38:47 - 38:51)
forgot about the fourth side of the (38:49 - 38:53)
square (38:51 - 38:53)
he was never seen again (38:54 - 38:59)
i was just wanting to see the busy (38:57 - 39:03)
street that i was planning on turning on (38:59 - 39:03)
walked right through it (39:04 - 39:07)
um (39:05 - 39:09)
pikmin's good i like it a lot uh we're (39:07 - 39:11)
gonna (39:09 - 39:13)
take a break (39:11 - 39:16)
uh and when we come back we have some (39:13 - 39:19)
uh tcg news and a couple other news (39:16 - 39:21)
articles not a lot this week but uh (39:19 - 39:22)
we're leading up to diamond pearl so (39:21 - 39:24)
obviously we'll have a lot (39:22 - 39:27)
uh next week's episode for that there's (39:24 - 39:29)
rumors and leaks since people got early (39:27 - 39:31)
copies of diamond and pearl that's out (39:29 - 39:33)
uh we're not gonna be talking about any (39:31 - 39:35)
of that look the game is like 12 days (39:33 - 39:36)
away so (39:35 - 39:38)
i'm sure if you care about that you've (39:36 - 39:39)
already looked it up but we'll take a (39:38 - 39:41)
quick break and when we get back we'll (39:39 - 39:43)
talk about the rest of the stuff (39:41 - 39:45)
did i just (39:43 - 39:47)
this is really dumb no one clipped this (39:45 - 39:51)
i just realized last week (39:47 - 39:53)
that paris hilton (39:51 - 39:55)
and hilton (39:53 - 39:59)
hotels are like the same i didn't (39:55 - 40:01)
i didn't put two and two together (39:59 - 40:03)
i didn't (40:01 - 40:06)
i just realized this oh he could go (40:03 - 40:08)
let's listen to a podcast (40:06 - 40:12)
that's like (40:08 - 40:12)
i was like i don't know why she's rich (40:13 - 40:17)
i didn't know (40:22 - 40:27)
this and we are back from our break (40:23 - 40:30)
we got some tcg stuff let's start with (40:27 - 40:32)
uh fusion strike which i believe comes (40:30 - 40:35)
out this week (40:32 - 40:37)
also full disclosure steve played the (40:35 - 40:40)
tcg in his current podcaster this is a (40:37 - 40:42)
steve only thing (40:40 - 40:44)
it's a steve only thing good (40:42 - 40:46)
good all right through this one fast (40:44 - 40:48)
you can uh you can ask me any questions (40:46 - 40:50)
greg i got answers for you oh so full (40:48 - 40:52)
disclosure the pokemon company did send (40:50 - 40:53)
me a (40:52 - 40:56)
box a booster box of fusion strike (40:53 - 40:58)
they sent it to my old po box so it's (40:56 - 41:01)
it's lost forever (40:58 - 41:01)
i don't know they told me eventually (41:01 - 41:04)
they'll forward it to my new po box but (41:02 - 41:06)
we'll we'll see but uh they did send me (41:04 - 41:09)
one i haven't opened any of them but uh (41:06 - 41:11)
the set does come out november 12th (41:09 - 41:13)
if you are curious (41:11 - 41:15)
let's say you're like oh yeah it's (41:13 - 41:16)
easier to find tcg cards should i get (41:15 - 41:18)
fusion strikes should i not i'm gonna (41:16 - 41:19)
say the answer is no don't get fusion (41:18 - 41:21)
strike if there's any cards you should (41:19 - 41:22)
be maybe buying (41:21 - 41:26)
um skit celebrations a fusion strike is (41:22 - 41:28)
over 260 cards (41:26 - 41:30)
there's a mew there's a bolton there's a (41:28 - 41:33)
chandeleur there's a gengar v max you're (41:30 - 41:34)
not going to pull any of these cards (41:33 - 41:35)
there's too many cards it's (41:34 - 41:38)
99 filler (41:35 - 41:39)
um (41:38 - 41:40)
if you're playing competitively (41:39 - 41:42)
obviously of course buy the cards you (41:40 - 41:43)
need to buy but (41:42 - 41:45)
um that set is oh there's a genocide (41:43 - 41:49)
card that set is out (41:45 - 41:49)
they announced a new set (41:49 - 41:55)
coming out february 25th it is (41:52 - 41:59)
170 cards which i fusion strike is 260 (41:55 - 42:02)
so this is 90 less cards so i'm already (41:59 - 42:04)
more into this set (42:02 - 42:06)
than the last set this is coming out (42:04 - 42:08)
february 25th so that's relatively close (42:06 - 42:11)
to pokemon day which is february (42:08 - 42:14)
26 i think (42:11 - 42:16)
i remember correctly i think that's (42:14 - 42:17)
right (42:16 - 42:19)
uh it's called sword and shield (42:17 - 42:20)
brilliant stars (42:19 - 42:24)
it introduces pokemon v star (42:20 - 42:28)
v star is an evolved form for pokemon v (42:24 - 42:30)
yes v cards still exist (42:28 - 42:32)
insert your joke here (42:30 - 42:35)
each pokemon v star has a potent v star (42:32 - 42:38)
power and each player can use only one v (42:35 - 42:40)
star power per game v star powers come (42:38 - 42:42)
in two varieties abilities and attacks (42:40 - 42:44)
both can drastically alter the course of (42:42 - 42:46)
battle as you might expect pokemon v (42:44 - 42:49)
star also have higher hp higher damage (42:46 - 42:51)
attacks to back up their vstar powers (42:49 - 42:53)
and like pokemon v they are rewarded (42:51 - 42:55)
with two prize cards if they are knocked (42:53 - 42:56)
out (42:55 - 42:59)
and they show an arceus v star which (42:56 - 43:02)
makes sense since uh that game is coming (42:59 - 43:03)
out relatively soon (43:02 - 43:05)
and then they show a charizard v star (43:03 - 43:07)
which looks to be bad (43:05 - 43:09)
um (43:07 - 43:11)
yeah it can't be bad as a charizard what (43:09 - 43:12)
are you talking about (43:11 - 43:15)
they have they have definitely mastered (43:12 - 43:17)
the it only took them 25 years to be (43:15 - 43:18)
like maybe we should just print (43:17 - 43:20)
charizard in every set (43:18 - 43:22)
um charizard cards in general are (43:20 - 43:24)
normally bad though (43:22 - 43:25)
like it is very (43:24 - 43:27)
like i the the last charizard i remember (43:25 - 43:29)
being like good competitively was (43:27 - 43:31)
resharam charizard and reshram is always (43:29 - 43:35)
good and charizard's always bad so (43:31 - 43:37)
charizard got lucky in that situation so (43:35 - 43:40)
okay (43:37 - 43:42)
you have to have a v card down to put a (43:40 - 43:45)
v star on top of it is this yes (43:42 - 43:46)
okay (43:45 - 43:48)
so there was a (43:46 - 43:49)
there have been other mechanics like (43:48 - 43:51)
that but another mechanic that would (43:49 - 43:52)
sound familiar would be mega evolution (43:51 - 43:55)
you have to have guard of war (43:52 - 43:57)
down already next turn you could mega (43:55 - 44:00)
evolve a gardevoir (43:57 - 44:00)
there was also called breaks and a very (44:00 - 44:04)
popular break card was greninja so you (44:02 - 44:07)
played on greninja and then (44:04 - 44:12)
you play greninja break on top of that (44:07 - 44:12)
is this continuing the trend of (44:15 - 44:22)
uh spiraling health and spiraling power (44:18 - 44:23)
um (44:22 - 44:26)
it's actually kind of a step back (44:23 - 44:28)
so normally (44:26 - 44:31)
if i remember correctly like a v max (44:28 - 44:34)
card was three prizes and they're going (44:31 - 44:38)
back to this being two prizes (44:34 - 44:40)
and i think the reason being is because (44:38 - 44:42)
people even though the cards had more (44:40 - 44:44)
damage or more health (44:42 - 44:45)
like (44:44 - 44:47)
losing a whole prize was still (44:45 - 44:49)
not worth playing (44:47 - 44:52)
it um (44:49 - 44:54)
so that was like a small it's not like (44:52 - 44:56)
it sounds like a small change to people (44:54 - 44:58)
who don't play but like obviously (44:56 - 45:00)
managing your prizes (44:58 - 45:01)
so (45:00 - 45:03)
like in order to win the game you would (45:01 - 45:05)
have to take six prizes (45:03 - 45:07)
and if you're playing these powerful v (45:05 - 45:10)
card pokemon those are two (45:07 - 45:11)
prize cards so you only have to knock (45:10 - 45:13)
out three (45:11 - 45:14)
and then if you're playing something (45:13 - 45:16)
like a tag team which i believe was (45:14 - 45:17)
three prizes (45:16 - 45:19)
then you only have to knock out two (45:17 - 45:21)
so people got really weird in like what (45:19 - 45:23)
they prioritize and like what they're (45:21 - 45:26)
putting in their deck because (45:23 - 45:26)
it affects how you build a deck so i (45:27 - 45:29)
think they're still trying to find that (45:28 - 45:32)
balance (45:29 - 45:35)
i don't know i don't the i i actually (45:32 - 45:37)
don't know how healthy the tcg is at (45:35 - 45:40)
this point (45:37 - 45:40)
compared to where when it was when i was (45:41 - 45:45)
playing and i was playing when it was (45:43 - 45:48)
um charizard uh restaurant charizard and (45:45 - 45:50)
zekrom pikachu (45:48 - 45:51)
and i think those cards are still (45:50 - 45:53)
playable (45:51 - 45:54)
so but (45:53 - 45:56)
they have double turbo energy card (45:54 - 45:58)
listed on this page what is turbo about (45:56 - 46:00)
this (45:58 - 46:03)
double turbo energy yeah (46:00 - 46:04)
let's see what it does (46:03 - 46:05)
as long as this card is attached to the (46:04 - 46:08)
pokemon it provides two colorless energy (46:05 - 46:11)
uh the attacks of this pokemon do 20 oh (46:08 - 46:14)
so yeah so turbo energy would be like (46:11 - 46:17)
so for arceus v trinity charge needs two (46:14 - 46:19)
energy but it can be any energy so you (46:17 - 46:21)
could just play one turbo on it which is (46:19 - 46:23)
actually really great because turbo says (46:21 - 46:26)
it reduces the damage (46:23 - 46:28)
done but trinity charge doesn't do any (46:26 - 46:28)
damage (46:28 - 46:31)
so you don't get that oh i see (46:28 - 46:34)
so you don't get that penalty (46:31 - 46:36)
because that penalty seems like a lot to (46:34 - 46:39)
me but minus 20 damage yeah (46:36 - 46:41)
yeah most most (46:39 - 46:44)
situations are usually 10 to 20 damage (46:41 - 46:46)
like oh i'm just 10 damage short (46:44 - 46:47)
so (46:46 - 46:49)
it matters like with (46:47 - 46:50)
when black and white first came out (46:49 - 46:53)
there was a reshiram and a zekrom card (46:50 - 46:56)
and they both had 130 hp but they both (46:53 - 47:00)
could only do max 120 damage (46:56 - 47:01)
so a lot of people would then try to (47:00 - 47:03)
figure out a way to do that extra 10 (47:01 - 47:06)
damage because (47:03 - 47:09)
you need to do 130 and it only did 120. (47:06 - 47:11)
so the tcg is very much built around (47:09 - 47:14)
it's like it's also in like vgc like oh (47:11 - 47:15)
if i only had one more turn i would have (47:14 - 47:17)
won right what or like oh they lived on (47:15 - 47:20)
one hp what is the deal with sharon's (47:17 - 47:23)
care put one of your star pokemon what (47:20 - 47:26)
does that mean (47:23 - 47:28)
sharon's care (47:26 - 47:31)
oh charon (47:28 - 47:33)
put one of your colorless pokemon that (47:31 - 47:35)
have any damage (47:33 - 47:37)
yes (47:35 - 47:39)
so yeah chair you sharon um because he's (47:37 - 47:41)
a normal type gym leader (47:39 - 47:42)
he (47:41 - 47:44)
takes advantage of like colorless (47:42 - 47:45)
pokemon so he he would probably i don't (47:44 - 47:47)
know if he's actually good but one of (47:45 - 47:49)
your color pokemon yeah that seems fine (47:47 - 47:50)
that seems really good for like an (47:49 - 47:52)
arceus (47:50 - 47:54)
because you're you're taking all the (47:52 - 47:55)
damage off of it and then replaying it (47:54 - 47:57)
back down (47:55 - 47:57)
uh (47:58 - 48:00)
okay (47:59 - 48:02)
last bit of tcg news is the pokemon (48:00 - 48:05)
trading card game live has been delayed (48:02 - 48:08)
until 2022 (48:05 - 48:08)
which is weird because they just (48:12 - 48:15)
announced that this app existed like a (48:14 - 48:17)
month ago yeah they just announced it (48:15 - 48:19)
said by the end of the year and they're (48:17 - 48:21)
like nope um this is off (48:19 - 48:23)
nintendolife.com back in september the (48:21 - 48:24)
pokemon company revealed the pokemon (48:23 - 48:26)
trading card game live a new app that (48:24 - 48:28)
was expected to launch sooner rather (48:26 - 48:30)
than later unfortunately plans have (48:28 - 48:32)
changed um (48:30 - 48:33)
and the pokemon company has made the (48:32 - 48:35)
tough decision to delay the game until (48:33 - 48:36)
2022 (48:35 - 48:38)
to offer a more polished experience the (48:36 - 48:40)
this will apply to the soft launch of (48:38 - 48:43)
the moba device that was open for the (48:40 - 48:45)
beta for the pc (48:43 - 48:49)
they did not say what part of 2022 that (48:45 - 48:50)
would be (48:49 - 48:54)
that's um purpose (48:50 - 48:54)
additionally some of you may have (48:55 - 48:59)
received code cards with the tcg live (48:56 - 49:01)
branding as part of some of the tcg (48:59 - 49:03)
products though the tcg live is not (49:01 - 49:05)
available at the time please know these (49:03 - 49:07)
code cards are still redeemable for the (49:05 - 49:09)
pokemon trading card game online which (49:07 - 49:12)
is the current app (49:09 - 49:12)
this (49:13 - 49:16)
is like a blessing for me because we're (49:14 - 49:18)
getting diamond and pearl in like 10 (49:16 - 49:21)
days and i just moved and (49:18 - 49:23)
obviously diamond and pearl will (49:21 - 49:24)
probably take a solid three months of my (49:23 - 49:27)
life and then arceus legends comes out (49:24 - 49:30)
and that will take time (49:27 - 49:33)
and so not having (49:30 - 49:34)
and we're (49:33 - 49:36)
if unite wasn't bad i would probably (49:34 - 49:38)
still be playing unite so not having (49:36 - 49:39)
another app (49:38 - 49:41)
to deal with (49:39 - 49:42)
because (49:41 - 49:44)
even even if you just wanted to get into (49:42 - 49:46)
the tcg like oh tcg live is when i'm (49:44 - 49:48)
gonna start playing the tcg (49:46 - 49:51)
you're like cool but as somebody who has (49:48 - 49:54)
hundreds of old booster packs in (49:51 - 49:56)
pokemon trading card game online and and (49:54 - 49:58)
boxes of code cards that i have yet to (49:56 - 50:00)
redeem (49:58 - 50:01)
like i (50:00 - 50:02)
i (50:01 - 50:05)
probably need a solid week of (50:02 - 50:06)
maintenance (50:05 - 50:07)
of like (50:06 - 50:09)
scanning these in opening these packs (50:07 - 50:11)
keeping some packs closed because they (50:09 - 50:12)
said if you have some packs closed (50:11 - 50:14)
they'll be converted into gems when this (50:12 - 50:16)
app launches and (50:14 - 50:17)
you have to like trade all these other (50:16 - 50:19)
cards because it will only take four so (50:17 - 50:21)
if you have like five mewtwo ex's you (50:19 - 50:23)
should probably trade one of the me two (50:21 - 50:26)
exes to a friend so they have a too ex (50:23 - 50:27)
because otherwise you lose the me too ex (50:26 - 50:28)
forever (50:27 - 50:31)
so there's just so much maintenance (50:28 - 50:32)
that was the stressful part for me like (50:31 - 50:34)
i don't have time for the maintenance (50:32 - 50:37)
and they said once this app launches tcg (50:34 - 50:40)
live tcg online will shut down and you (50:37 - 50:43)
won't be able to get back in (50:40 - 50:43)
but i don't i don't (50:44 - 50:47)
they didn't say why (50:45 - 50:50)
what went wrong i didn't (50:47 - 50:50)
but i think it's fine i think it's i (50:50 - 50:53)
don't think it's that big of a deal like (50:52 - 50:56)
tcgo is still working (50:53 - 50:58)
sounds to me like somebody was like we (50:56 - 50:59)
should announce that we're going to have (50:58 - 51:01)
it by the end of the year and that'll (50:59 - 51:02)
force us to have it done by the end of (51:01 - 51:04)
the year and a month later they're like (51:02 - 51:05)
we're not going to have this done by the (51:04 - 51:08)
end of the year (51:05 - 51:08)
yeah that's a (51:09 - 51:12)
there's a couple of big things that have (51:10 - 51:16)
been delayed that i'm like oh (51:12 - 51:18)
it makes things easier (51:16 - 51:20)
but also yeah (51:18 - 51:24)
i have a fundamental question for steve (51:20 - 51:25)
okay (51:24 - 51:28)
now that all of the pokemon celebration (51:25 - 51:32)
parade figures are back in (51:28 - 51:33)
pokemon center (51:32 - 51:35)
as a person who is like oh i should have (51:33 - 51:38)
gotten all those parade figures (51:35 - 51:40)
uh what is your decision now that you (51:38 - 51:41)
actually can (51:40 - 51:44)
uh are oh they added a bunch of train (51:41 - 51:45)
stuff too (51:44 - 51:46)
they did (51:45 - 51:49)
they're all still bad but here we are (51:46 - 51:52)
i would s (51:49 - 51:55)
i guess there's parade (51:52 - 51:55)
i don't think the parade is that bad (51:55 - 51:59)
i think the parade is better than the (51:58 - 52:02)
train (51:59 - 52:06)
[Laughter] (52:02 - 52:08)
i mean we still have (52:06 - 52:11)
uh yarfing torchic (52:08 - 52:14)
and the rpg excuse me (52:11 - 52:14)
and yarfing froakie to deal with in this (52:15 - 52:20)

then walks away from me (53:57 - 54:00)
is she wrong (54:02 - 54:08)
no she's not wrong (54:04 - 54:08)
but i'm like a hundred fifty dollars for (54:12 - 54:16)
some parade figures that'll collect dust (54:14 - 54:17)
on my shelf just like a (54:16 - 54:21)
200 switch light (54:17 - 54:23)

all the peakmen i have to go to all the (54:56 - 55:00)
community days for 50 hours but when the (54:58 - 55:01)
when the (55:00 - 55:03)
when the brass tacks are in front of me (55:01 - 55:05)
you're like nah i gotta skip on that (55:03 - 55:08)
parade i'm not buying another light for (55:05 - 55:10)
myself and you call yours you you put (55:08 - 55:12)
pride in your collection that is your (55:10 - 55:15)
identity and you're tossing it aside if (55:12 - 55:18)
you're not a collector steve what are (55:15 - 55:21)
you (55:18 - 55:21)
[Laughter] (55:21 - 55:28)
uh also let me tell you christmas when (55:26 - 55:30)
you're packing stuff came out and it's (55:28 - 55:32)
not good (55:30 - 55:34)
there's some good christmas tip love (55:32 - 55:36)
stuff (55:34 - 55:38)
there's a piplup riding a man a mankind (55:36 - 55:42)
or or something man tyke man tyke (55:38 - 55:45)
uh there are some like piplup keychains (55:42 - 55:47)
those are good i'm saying the train the (55:45 - 55:49)
train is not good there's nothing about (55:47 - 55:51)
that holiday train (55:49 - 55:52)
because it doesn't have people up on it (55:51 - 55:55)
absolutely but also like (55:52 - 55:57)
they decided in the middle of the train (55:55 - 56:00)
to put snorlax (55:57 - 56:03)
asleep on the train tracks i kind of (56:00 - 56:05)
like that where else would snorlax be (56:03 - 56:07)
but it's like (56:05 - 56:09)
where does that go (56:07 - 56:10)
i think it goes in front of the tree it (56:09 - 56:12)
has to go in front so they (56:10 - 56:14)
they've just decided to add a new front (56:12 - 56:16)
part to the train (56:14 - 56:18)
it could go in the back of the train i (56:16 - 56:20)
guess but then why does anybody care did (56:18 - 56:23)
it fall off the train oh did you do (56:20 - 56:26)
this audio podcast (56:23 - 56:27)
uh but if you (56:26 - 56:29)
i encourage everyone to go to pokemon (56:27 - 56:31)
center.com and zoom into this machamp's (56:29 - 56:34)
face on the deliberate holidays (56:31 - 56:37)
i mean it's poorly painted but it's very (56:34 - 56:38)
good (56:37 - 56:41)
it's a lot happening it's very concerned (56:38 - 56:43)
that snorlax is about to get run over by (56:41 - 56:46)
a train pangu did you order the 99 (56:43 - 56:50)
piplup pokemon squishy plush 19 inch (56:46 - 56:52)
i have not but it's been getting texted (56:50 - 56:55)
to me daily and i have been fantasizing (56:52 - 56:59)
about squishing this squishy piplup so (56:55 - 57:01)
it might still happen but um i do have a (56:59 - 57:03)
lot of penguins already i don't know if (57:01 - 57:06)
i can justify getting another penguin (57:03 - 57:09)
uh i guess you're not a true collector (57:06 - 57:13)
i am not claiming to be but you could be (57:09 - 57:16)
as happy as the person in these she is (57:13 - 57:19)
the girl in the giant in the photos is (57:16 - 57:22)
very happy i'm sure she would be um (57:19 - 57:24)
i was trying to think whether it would (57:22 - 57:26)
be as squishy as the pokemon center ice (57:24 - 57:29)
ice ice cube which is very squishy and (57:26 - 57:31)
since like squishy is in the name it (57:29 - 57:34)
must be extra super duper squishy (57:31 - 57:36)
i mean you know it's that weird (57:34 - 57:39)
polyester stuff with the beads in it (57:36 - 57:40)
yeah (57:39 - 57:42)
like ice cube is a good squishy he's (57:40 - 57:44)
like the good kind of squishy the the (57:42 - 57:46)
polyester beads squishy it's not as (57:44 - 57:48)
satisfying (57:46 - 57:49)
if you get nothing (57:48 - 57:52)
eleven dollars to get the squishy (57:49 - 57:56)
piplup keychain it's 11 bucks (57:52 - 57:57)
that's true you can get just the (57:56 - 57:58)
keychain (57:57 - 58:00)
you get a little hand squishy (57:58 - 58:02)
when you need it for those moments of (58:00 - 58:03)
stress (58:02 - 58:05)
i i have been squishing a bubble tea in (58:03 - 58:06)
my hands but i dropped it on the floor (58:05 - 58:08)
so now i'm squishing it with my feet um (58:06 - 58:10)
because i do appreciate having squishy (58:08 - 58:13)
things in my hands at all times (58:10 - 58:18)
i will say the holiday piplup pin (58:13 - 58:20)
is very cute (58:18 - 58:22)
i haven't seen the plan i don't think (58:20 - 58:25)
pip-up wrapped up in ribbon (58:22 - 58:28)
adorable it's a three-pack it's this (58:25 - 58:31)
deliberate garbage pikachu (58:28 - 58:33)
it's 20 bucks (58:31 - 58:35)
yes our three favorite penguins uh (58:33 - 58:37)
delhi bird and pikachu (58:35 - 58:40)
i mean deliberate is kind of a penguin (58:37 - 58:42)
that's definitely a penguin (58:40 - 58:45)
two things inside of its butt (58:42 - 58:47)
okay uh two things (58:45 - 58:49)
they (58:47 - 58:51)
greg is correct the christmas selection (58:49 - 58:53)
this time around is bad it was much (58:51 - 58:55)
better last year okay the one thing that (58:53 - 58:57)
i did want i wanted the snum holiday (58:55 - 59:02)
sweater i ordered it and it's sold out (58:57 - 59:02)
because i'm not a medium or a small (59:03 - 59:06)
there's number two that i'm a medium or (59:06 - 59:12)
a small number two is they increased the (59:08 - 59:14)
price of the record player (59:12 - 59:15)
yeah (59:14 - 59:17)
it was like three (59:15 - 59:18)
20 (59:17 - 59:20)
at one point right (59:18 - 59:21)
and now it's four hundred dollars it's (59:20 - 59:23)
the same record player they just double (59:21 - 59:24)
this (59:23 - 59:26)
and now it's oh it's more rare because (59:24 - 59:29)
there's fewer of them (59:26 - 59:32)
like what (59:29 - 59:35)
i'm very i i wanted the record player (59:32 - 59:37)
but the fact that they jacked the price (59:35 - 59:38)
up like 80 bucks i know i know i don't (59:37 - 59:40)
want it anymore (59:38 - 59:43)
you advertised it for over a week at a (59:40 - 59:46)
lower price you can't just increase it (59:43 - 59:48)
yeah they can i mean yes they can canada (59:46 - 59:50)
they did that's how (59:48 - 59:54)
retail works i'm very upset (59:50 - 59:56)
this increase i will say i the only (59:54 - 59:58)
thing of the holiday collection that i (59:56 - 59:59)
actually (59:58 - 60:01)
kind of want (59:59 - 60:02)
i had the chinchow plush right i almost (60:01 - 60:04)
wanted the (60:02 - 60:06)
uh snug (60:04 - 60:09)
one piece pajamas until i realized it (60:06 - 60:11)
came with the hood and then i was out (60:09 - 60:14)
what because hoods are awful no the only (60:11 - 60:15)
thing that i actually kind of want is (60:14 - 60:19)
the gallerian ponyta winter knit beanie (60:15 - 60:22)
because that thing is so cute (60:19 - 60:24)
and where the heck okay thing i want a (60:22 - 60:25)
preference this is a family friendly (60:24 - 60:27)
podcast we're a family friendly family (60:25 - 60:29)
here but if we're talking about (60:27 - 60:32)
one-piece pajamas we're all thinking it (60:29 - 60:34)
you cannot go to the bathroom without (60:32 - 60:36)
taking that entire thing off (60:34 - 60:38)
like you just can't well some of them (60:36 - 60:39)
have like the butt flaps yeah right butt (60:38 - 60:42)
flaps exist for a reason i don't think (60:39 - 60:44)
unfortunately we just don't have as much (60:42 - 60:46)
we need to be (60:44 - 60:48)
as accurate as possible when it comes to (60:46 - 60:50)
pokemon merchandise on this podcast and (60:48 - 60:51)
i'm looking at this guy's butt right now (60:50 - 60:53)
there's no question there's no flat back (60:51 - 60:54)
there (60:53 - 60:57)
there's nothing (60:54 - 60:57)
water or liquids (61:03 - 61:06)
an hour at least two hours before you go (61:04 - 61:08)
to bed and you're not putting this on (61:06 - 61:09)
until you go to bed (61:08 - 61:12)
what i feel like you're putting this on (61:09 - 61:13)
as soon as you get home from work i mean (61:12 - 61:15)
assuming that you (61:13 - 61:17)
you go out (61:15 - 61:18)
no (61:17 - 61:19)
they're cool you're not wearing (61:18 - 61:21)
something pajamas and you do not wear (61:19 - 61:24)
pajamas during the day i do like that it (61:21 - 61:27)
has the hood the hood is awful (61:24 - 61:28)
i feel like for 60 bucks it needs butt (61:27 - 61:31)
flap it does like so like the snob (61:28 - 61:35)
holiday pajama pantsuit i literally (61:31 - 61:38)
had the thing up i had my credit card in (61:35 - 61:39)
hand and i was clicking through the (61:38 - 61:42)
pictures and i because i had ignored the (61:39 - 61:43)
hooded part because i thought well maybe (61:42 - 61:46)
it's detachable it's not and then i cut (61:43 - 61:50)
it yeah 100 scissors are detachable (61:46 - 61:52)
okay i would have to cut it and then i (61:50 - 61:54)
have to sew the fringe because i would (61:52 - 61:56)
not want it to start unraveling for my (61:54 - 61:59)
poor cut no yeah they should offer a (61:56 - 62:01)
non-hooded version or it should detach (61:59 - 62:02)
what's wrong with how it's hoods are so (62:01 - 62:05)
cozy hoods are awful (62:02 - 62:07)
they (62:05 - 62:08)
people grab onto them people put things (62:07 - 62:11)
in there how old are you how old are the (62:08 - 62:13)
people around you look who's grabbing (62:11 - 62:14)
you (62:13 - 62:16)
people people in this world are wild (62:14 - 62:18)
there's something about you (62:16 - 62:21)
i'm not putting up with it anymore i am (62:18 - 62:23)
not (62:21 - 62:23)
ever since i was a child people tug it (62:23 - 62:27)
on your hood not it's not worth it plus (62:25 - 62:28)
what you're saying is that one of these (62:27 - 62:30)
coveted mod hoodies that you own is just (62:28 - 62:33)
going to collect dust (62:30 - 62:34)
it is literally sitting (62:33 - 62:37)
next to my dresser (62:34 - 62:39)
not on the floor but off the floor and (62:37 - 62:41)
brent my husband said oh i'd wear that (62:39 - 62:43)
except i can't fit into it as a dad it's (62:41 - 62:45)
literally just gonna sit here (62:43 - 62:46)
because i will never wear it because i (62:45 - 62:48)
will never wear a hoodie also hoods are (62:46 - 62:50)
like the worst thing to actually keep (62:48 - 62:52)
your head warm because if there's any (62:50 - 62:54)
wind it just cups in it cups to the (62:52 - 62:56)
front it lets you squish it close and (62:54 - 62:58)
then (62:56 - 62:59)
i've got this thing squished around my (62:58 - 63:01)
face hoods are awful i feel like (62:59 - 63:03)
everything greg is saying about like (63:01 - 63:05)
hoods and pajamas and onesies and (63:03 - 63:06)
everything is just so diametrically (63:05 - 63:08)
opposed to everything i believe about (63:06 - 63:11)
what is comfortable (63:08 - 63:11)
the latheon glacion (63:11 - 63:16)
t-shirt however (63:13 - 63:17)
i may have to purchase this because it (63:16 - 63:20)
is outstanding (63:17 - 63:20)
i don't the the fee the theme of (63:21 - 63:28)
underwater christmas i respect (63:25 - 63:29)
that somebody probably watched the (63:28 - 63:31)
little mermaid before they went into (63:29 - 63:32)
this (63:31 - 63:36)
but i just i just don't dig it (63:32 - 63:36)
it's just a very like weird (63:36 - 63:41)
what do you have against atlantis and (63:39 - 63:44)
atlanteans all five atlantis is my (63:41 - 63:46)
favorite shiny song thank you very much (63:44 - 63:48)
um (63:46 - 63:48)
i i i don't know i don't know i'm very (63:49 - 63:54)
disappointed about this christmas (63:52 - 63:55)
offering i think i liked the last (63:54 - 63:57)
christmas better because they did a lot (63:55 - 63:59)
of like gold (63:57 - 64:01)
and white and black stuff and i'm very (63:59 - 64:03)
into that aesthetic and i liked the (64:01 - 64:05)
subtleness of their christmas stuff last (64:03 - 64:07)
year it felt like something (64:05 - 64:08)
rubbed off (64:07 - 64:10)
yeah i bought two of those one to (64:08 - 64:12)
collect obviously to put next to my (64:10 - 64:14)
ancient mew the other one was like let's (64:12 - 64:16)
use these and then they (64:14 - 64:18)
they they fell apart (64:16 - 64:20)
they're now used for cats but the winter (64:18 - 64:23)
picture cover which is blue green gray (64:20 - 64:25)
and red those are very subtle and nice (64:23 - 64:26)
those are but i got the pillows last (64:25 - 64:28)
year so i don't need to have black and (64:26 - 64:30)
white pillows not these color ones and (64:28 - 64:31)
the right i don't need any more (64:30 - 64:33)
christmas peppers in the back (64:31 - 64:34)
you always need more christmas pillows (64:33 - 64:36)
these are christmas colors oh they are (64:34 - 64:37)
really cool in the back i didn't realize (64:36 - 64:39)
they had a back to them yeah there's (64:37 - 64:42)
pineco and oh (64:39 - 64:43)
these are pillow covers these aren't (64:42 - 64:45)
even real pillows (64:43 - 64:48)
you can put them on anything (64:45 - 64:48)
i'm kind of into that (64:48 - 64:51)
they're very good and you should we just (64:49 - 64:56)
got a new living room rug it's very um (64:51 - 64:57)
no i did not get the po that was stolen (64:56 - 65:00)
art (64:57 - 65:00)
we got so our our when we moved in the (65:01 - 65:05)
house was already most of the rooms were (65:03 - 65:06)
already painted they were painted like (65:05 - 65:10)
the standard like hgtv bluish gray yep (65:06 - 65:14)
which is like a good color it's fine (65:10 - 65:16)
and then we have a gray couch and irene (65:14 - 65:19)
was like our room is too (65:16 - 65:23)
boring and so i got a very loud rug (65:19 - 65:25)
from target that just arrived (65:23 - 65:28)
so maybe maybe i get these pillows they (65:25 - 65:31)
spice up the gray couch (65:28 - 65:31)
and get an extra set to give me for (65:33 - 65:35)
christmas (65:34 - 65:37)
okay all right (65:35 - 65:39)
make your christmas list now greg (65:37 - 65:41)
ah my christmas list is continually and (65:39 - 65:44)
constantly updated (65:41 - 65:47)
good to know all right um (65:44 - 65:49)
question of the week is that where we're (65:47 - 65:51)
at yeah because well we can't do pokemon (65:49 - 65:54)
the week because will's not here (65:51 - 65:56)
he's on a mission where is he's on a (65:54 - 65:59)
mission to teja uh all right welcome to (65:56 - 66:03)
the question of the week (65:59 - 66:03)
did i ask oh i did ask good you did (66:04 - 66:08)
uh let's do al's question (66:09 - 66:14)
we did this (66:12 - 66:15)
no we didn't we (66:14 - 66:17)
we talked about it for the first half of (66:15 - 66:20)
the show (66:17 - 66:20)
we did not talk about this (66:23 - 66:28)
we talked about the topic but we didn't (66:25 - 66:30)
answer why do you think go so al says (66:28 - 66:32)
why do you think go has managed to last (66:30 - 66:33)
so long when wizards unite has died less (66:32 - 66:36)
than half time we didn't bring this up (66:33 - 66:37)
but (66:36 - 66:39)
i'm going to assume that part of the (66:37 - 66:41)
reason why they decided to close was (66:39 - 66:43)
licensing fees (66:41 - 66:46)
yeah i'm (66:43 - 66:47)
uh (66:46 - 66:49)
one of the things i think white pokemon (66:47 - 66:51)
go so the (66:49 - 66:54)
what pokemon go does directly also ties (66:51 - 66:56)
to what you do in the game right like (66:54 - 66:58)
you collect in the game everything that (66:56 - 67:00)
you did in the main series game and (66:58 - 67:02)
everything that a lot of people like in (67:00 - 67:04)
the main series games you could still do (67:02 - 67:06)
in pokemon go (67:04 - 67:08)
what everybody likes about harry potter (67:06 - 67:10)
which is imagining that they're a wizard (67:08 - 67:13)
and in a school and having hijinks (67:10 - 67:17)
did not translate over into the game (67:13 - 67:19)
so i think there was a fundamental (67:17 - 67:21)
disconnect from what people how people (67:19 - 67:24)
interact and feel about harry potter (67:21 - 67:27)
to how they felt about a clone of (67:24 - 67:29)
pokemon go sort of (67:27 - 67:31)
with harry potter shellacked on top i (67:29 - 67:33)
just don't think it was a good fit (67:31 - 67:36)
from the start and it wasn't at all what (67:33 - 67:39)
harry potter fans wanted from a game (67:36 - 67:41)
when we did go fest (67:39 - 67:44)
at the art park (67:41 - 67:44)
yeah (67:44 - 67:47)
and i had the stream backpack on (67:44 - 67:49)
and then you guys left for food (67:47 - 67:51)
and then everyone gave me a weird look (67:49 - 67:54)
when i said i can't eat right now (67:51 - 67:55)
because i was so (67:54 - 67:58)
exhausted from walking and (67:55 - 68:00)
with the (67:58 - 68:03)
very hot backpack on all day (68:00 - 68:05)
when you guys left (68:03 - 68:07)
the couple (68:05 - 68:08)
there was like uh i don't know if they (68:07 - 68:09)
were a couple but (68:08 - 68:11)
i'll just say two friends were were (68:09 - 68:14)
talking to each other and they were (68:11 - 68:16)
very excited and they were talking about (68:14 - 68:18)
harry potter wizards unite (68:16 - 68:20)
it was (68:18 - 68:22)
very jarring to walk past that (68:20 - 68:24)
conversation of two people being like oh (68:22 - 68:26)
my gosh they just added this in wizards (68:24 - 68:28)
unite and i can't wait for this event it (68:26 - 68:30)
was very jarring (68:28 - 68:31)
um (68:30 - 68:32)
that has nothing to do with al's (68:31 - 68:34)
question it was a very fond memory i (68:32 - 68:36)
have about wizards unite that happened (68:34 - 68:38)
like six months ago or whenever gofest (68:36 - 68:40)
was (68:38 - 68:40)
i (68:40 - 68:42)
but this is (68:41 - 68:43)
also what we didn't talk about earlier (68:42 - 68:45)
is i do hate when people say like the (68:43 - 68:48)
only reason pokemon goes successful is (68:45 - 68:51)
because of the pokemon brand (68:48 - 68:54)
i just don't (68:51 - 68:54)
obviously the pokemon brand is very big (68:54 - 68:58)
but i there are there have been plenty (68:56 - 68:59)
of games (68:58 - 69:01)
that pokemon there have been plenty of (68:59 - 69:03)
just things that have exist that pokemon (69:01 - 69:04)
is attached to (69:03 - 69:05)
that (69:04 - 69:07)
doesn't sell or fault has fallen off (69:05 - 69:09)
pokemon duel um (69:07 - 69:11)
pokemon rumble rush (69:09 - 69:14)
uh pokemon mystery dungeon like (69:11 - 69:16)
like i know people like mystery dungeon (69:14 - 69:17)
it doesn't sell as well as these people (69:16 - 69:21)
think they do it just it just doesn't (69:17 - 69:22)
so just because the pokemon brand is (69:21 - 69:25)
attached i don't think is the leading or (69:22 - 69:28)
reason why pokemon go is so like harry (69:25 - 69:30)
potter is incredibly successful (69:28 - 69:32)
yeah like like like as much as jk (69:30 - 69:35)
rowling sucks now (69:32 - 69:37)
like that franchise has done very well (69:35 - 69:40)
in movies and and other forms of media (69:37 - 69:43)
so i don't think the the sole reason or (69:40 - 69:45)
why pokemon go is so successful is (69:43 - 69:47)
because of pokemon another thing i just (69:45 - 69:49)
want to point out is (69:47 - 69:51)
why i pointed out the games that pokemon (69:49 - 69:53)
was attached to that failed is think (69:51 - 69:55)
about how many people (69:53 - 69:58)
never played a pokemon game and played (69:55 - 70:00)
pokemon go yeah and that's (69:58 - 70:03)
and that's not like that is their game (70:00 - 70:05)
in like it was they they didn't know (70:03 - 70:07)
anything about pokemon and because they (70:05 - 70:09)
liked go so much they became a pokemon (70:07 - 70:10)
fan (70:09 - 70:14)
um and and i don't know (70:10 - 70:17)
if that is the same for harry potter i (70:14 - 70:19)
don't know if somebody (70:17 - 70:21)
i'm sure there were some people (70:19 - 70:22)
but i (70:21 - 70:24)
i mean i think also one of the strengths (70:22 - 70:28)
about pokemon is (70:24 - 70:30)
it plays on our natural affinity for (70:28 - 70:33)
pets right like we all we are as a (70:30 - 70:35)
species (70:33 - 70:37)
most of us are very pet cute animal (70:35 - 70:39)
focused and one of the strengths of (70:37 - 70:41)
pokemon is (70:39 - 70:44)
you can show people the breath (70:41 - 70:46)
of all the pokemon and (70:44 - 70:48)
everybody will find something that they (70:46 - 70:52)
are drawn to they're like i really like (70:48 - 70:54)
this one i like this design i think it's (70:52 - 70:56)
cool i think it's cute whatever (70:54 - 70:59)
there's something about (70:56 - 71:00)
pokemon (70:59 - 71:03)
that their designs are so good that (71:00 - 71:05)
literally everybody can look at (71:03 - 71:07)
something and say i really like that i (71:05 - 71:09)
know nothing about the game but that (71:07 - 71:11)
that attracts me (71:09 - 71:14)
and harry potter is (71:11 - 71:16)
a subsection in off like a lot of people (71:14 - 71:18)
like fantasy (71:16 - 71:21)
but harry potter is a very specific type (71:18 - 71:22)
of fantasy (71:21 - 71:23)
and (71:22 - 71:25)
the creatures are all (71:23 - 71:28)
part of myth and so that same connection (71:25 - 71:30)
that we make that with animals and pets (71:28 - 71:33)
doesn't exist in that world and i think (71:30 - 71:34)
people who really like harry potter like (71:33 - 71:37)
it for very different reasons than (71:34 - 71:39)
wizards unite (71:37 - 71:41)
presented yeah i've never played the (71:39 - 71:43)
harry potter game so i know about that (71:41 - 71:45)
but i think what greg was saying earlier (71:43 - 71:47)
about the mismatch between (71:45 - 71:48)
like the gameplay mechanics of the (71:47 - 71:51)
mobile game and like the franchise as a (71:48 - 71:53)
whole makes a lot of sense to me like um (71:51 - 71:55)
before ever playing pokemon go and i (71:53 - 71:58)
heard that pokemon go is launching it's (71:55 - 71:59)
like okay that makes sense you like have (71:58 - 72:00)
a game where you can walk around and (71:59 - 72:02)
catch pokemon that makes perfect sense (72:00 - 72:05)
but like i can't even uh like (72:02 - 72:06)
conjure up a representation of what a (72:05 - 72:08)
walking harry potter mobile game would (72:06 - 72:10)
be like and what the point of it would (72:08 - 72:13)
be yeah i think that was the problem i (72:10 - 72:15)
also had with it at (72:13 - 72:16)
when i started playing it the first time (72:15 - 72:19)
is i didn't understand what the concept (72:16 - 72:20)
should be (72:19 - 72:22)
but i knew when i was playing it that it (72:20 - 72:24)
wasn't this (72:22 - 72:26)
like i don't know what i wanted to be (72:24 - 72:28)
but i'm pretty sure i didn't want it to (72:26 - 72:29)
be this (72:28 - 72:31)
i think i could say the same thing about (72:29 - 72:33)
pikmin like i when they were like not (72:31 - 72:35)
antics making a pikmin game we all like (72:33 - 72:37)
was like well that's weird like why (72:35 - 72:39)
pikmin there's so many other nintendo (72:37 - 72:40)
series that are more successful than (72:39 - 72:42)
pikmin (72:40 - 72:43)
and (72:42 - 72:45)
like i didn't look anything into it like (72:43 - 72:47)
i remember reading the press release on (72:45 - 72:48)
the show of like niantics making a (72:47 - 72:50)
pikmin game it's out in i think it was (72:48 - 72:53)
in beta for like south korea (72:50 - 72:54)
and i didn't look into it and then when (72:53 - 72:56)
it came out i downloaded it (72:54 - 72:59)
and it asked very little of me (72:56 - 73:02)
and it was like cute and charming enough (72:59 - 73:04)
and i feel like because it asked very (73:02 - 73:06)
little of me i was it was incentivized (73:04 - 73:08)
to come back and be like okay what else (73:06 - 73:10)
do you what else are you doing with (73:08 - 73:12)
harry potter i was like (73:10 - 73:15)
and i i have no clue how a new go player (73:12 - 73:17)
comes in to go because i think go is (73:15 - 73:20)
incredibly complicated from when it was (73:17 - 73:22)
five years ago (73:20 - 73:23)
and i think pengu can speak to that (73:22 - 73:25)
because i remember her getting into go (73:23 - 73:27)
and being like what does this do what (73:25 - 73:28)
does this do should i power up these (73:27 - 73:31)
pokemon um (73:28 - 73:33)
but when harry potter asked so much of (73:31 - 73:34)
me (73:33 - 73:36)
at the start and i was like i don't have (73:34 - 73:38)
time to (73:36 - 73:39)
answer all these questions right now (73:38 - 73:41)
like you're you're asking a lot and i (73:39 - 73:44)
don't know if i like you yet (73:41 - 73:46)
but i also think one of the strengths of (73:44 - 73:47)
pikmin is the same thing that's a (73:46 - 73:49)
strength for go (73:47 - 73:52)
peakman the games is about pulling the (73:49 - 73:53)
pigment out of the ground (73:52 - 73:56)
getting your platoon and sending them on (73:53 - 73:58)
expeditions like a core gameplay of why (73:56 - 74:01)
people like beekman is still very much (73:58 - 74:04)
represented in pikmin bloom you you you (74:01 - 74:06)
plant them you pull them out you send (74:04 - 74:08)
them off to do stuff like that (74:06 - 74:10)
that hook is there and i just don't (74:08 - 74:12)
think it was ever fully there for (74:10 - 74:13)
wizards unite (74:12 - 74:15)
and i think it may have very (74:13 - 74:16)
disappointed later that there's not (74:15 - 74:18)
giant duracell batteries i can't carry (74:16 - 74:19)
back (74:18 - 74:21)
yeah (74:19 - 74:22)
but like i think (74:21 - 74:24)
later like there's fans of wizards (74:22 - 74:26)
tonight who got into it and got a lot (74:24 - 74:27)
out of the game because i didn't (74:26 - 74:29)
continue with it but i think it just did (74:27 - 74:32)
not have an auspicious start it didn't (74:29 - 74:33)
start on the right foot for a lot of (74:32 - 74:36)
people (74:33 - 74:36)
