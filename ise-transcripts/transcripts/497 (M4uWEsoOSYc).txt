[Music] (0:02 - 0:26)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:26 - 0:32)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:30 - 0:35)
super effective i'm your host sbj (0:32 - 0:38)
with me is will (0:35 - 0:40)
i i'm i'm here because greg's in hawaii (0:38 - 0:43)
this week (0:40 - 0:43)
oh that's the right thing are we (0:43 - 0:47)
recording in the right format well (0:45 - 0:49)
we are recording in the correct format (0:47 - 0:51)
yes the three f all right yes well (0:49 - 0:54)
because greg is in hawaii this week we (0:51 - 0:57)
brought uh al in from (0:54 - 0:59)
europe (0:57 - 1:01)
with all that europe news (0:59 - 1:03)
it's the some part like you the easiest (1:01 - 1:04)
part to remember is the fact that i'm (1:03 - 1:06)
from scotland steve i don't think that's (1:04 - 1:09)
the hard bit oh yeah well you know (1:06 - 1:12)
somewhere tucked away over there (1:09 - 1:14)
somewhere on the map ah so hey here's (1:12 - 1:18)
the thing uh we have not done an episode (1:14 - 1:21)
like this since probably (1:18 - 1:23)
black and white i think is when we well (1:21 - 1:24)
and that was kind of unfair because (1:23 - 1:27)
black and white came out in japan uh (1:24 - 1:28)
like a year (1:27 - 1:30)
before it came out to everyone else that (1:28 - 1:32)
wasn't a year it was like six months i (1:30 - 1:34)
don't know i'm thinking more like x and (1:32 - 1:37)
y or omega ruby alpha sapphire was the (1:34 - 1:40)
last time we did something like this (1:37 - 1:44)
yeah maybe um (1:40 - 1:44)
i think al and i did do some (1:44 - 1:50)
sun and moon spoilers at the end of an (1:47 - 1:51)
episode after credits (1:50 - 1:55)
oh yeah yeah i think we did that before (1:51 - 1:56)
uh well if you're listening hello uh (1:55 - 1:58)
we're a pokemon podcast that's pretty (1:56 - 2:00)
obvious probably because you clicked on (1:58 - 2:02)
it in some sort of podcast app we are (2:00 - 2:04)
going to be talking about the leaks for (2:02 - 2:07)
pokemon legends we're recording this on (2:04 - 2:11)
january 23rd the game leaked (2:07 - 2:14)
five days ago pretty pretty fully (2:11 - 2:17)
uh the game comes out on january 28th we (2:14 - 2:21)
will be talking about the pokedex (2:17 - 2:24)
the pokedex the new pokemon (2:21 - 2:27)
and then a couple mechanical changes um (2:24 - 2:29)
so if you don't want spoilers probably (2:27 - 2:31)
wait to listen to this episode after you (2:29 - 2:33)
play the game on friday (2:31 - 2:36)
uh we will not be talking any story (2:33 - 2:40)
spoilers i'm going to assume (2:36 - 2:42)
that you're going to catch arceus (2:40 - 2:44)
probably at some point in the game (2:42 - 2:46)
because he's the game is called legends (2:44 - 2:48)
arceus (2:46 - 2:48)
ah (2:48 - 2:50)
i mean arceus is a mythical you don't (2:48 - 2:53)
normally catch those (2:50 - 2:54)
yeah that's true i'm gonna i'm gonna (2:53 - 2:56)
assume that the game has something to do (2:54 - 2:57)
with our case we're not gonna talk about (2:56 - 3:00)
any spoiler stuff um unless i i think (2:57 - 3:02)
everyone probably knows that cleaver is (3:00 - 3:05)
the first probably like boss (3:02 - 3:07)
uh just based off the trailers but i (3:05 - 3:10)
guess that is also assumption um (3:07 - 3:12)
whether or not cleaver is number one (3:10 - 3:14)
um but yeah that's pretty much going to (3:12 - 3:16)
be the episode there's gonna be no (3:14 - 3:17)
question of the week sorry to youtube (3:16 - 3:20)
and anyone who wrote in uh will has a (3:17 - 3:23)
very special pokemon of the week but (3:20 - 3:24)
very special (3:23 - 3:27)
very special if you make it too uh but (3:24 - 3:29)
yeah we're going to be talking about the (3:27 - 3:31)
the pokemon shown the new ones uh the (3:29 - 3:33)
pokedex (3:31 - 3:34)
size specifically is going to be the (3:33 - 3:36)
topic and then some of the things that (3:34 - 3:38)
would make this game different and (3:36 - 3:40)
that's pretty much going to be today's (3:38 - 3:41)
episode and then (3:40 - 3:42)
i i still don't know what we're going to (3:41 - 3:44)
do for the mini series i'm thinking for (3:42 - 3:47)
greg and i uh we're gonna do like a (3:44 - 3:49)
uh first impressions (3:47 - 3:51)
a middle impressions and then like a (3:49 - 3:52)
final impressions maybe just like a (3:51 - 3:55)
three episode part (3:52 - 3:57)
because again i have no clue how this (3:55 - 3:59)
game is structured or (3:57 - 4:00)
i i don't even after looking at the (3:59 - 4:02)
leaks and i'm like (4:00 - 4:04)
it's a definitely a video game i don't (4:02 - 4:07)
know how they break it up into parts (4:04 - 4:08)
but (4:07 - 4:10)
also there's a lot of stuff i haven't (4:08 - 4:12)
looked at and i (4:10 - 4:15)
i i'm i might be speculating i'm sure (4:12 - 4:17)
there are stuff that i've seen that al (4:15 - 4:18)
hasn't seen i'm sure there's stuff alice (4:17 - 4:20)
scene that will hasn't seen so i ain't (4:18 - 4:23)
seen nothing not exactly except for what (4:20 - 4:24)
you guys put in front of my face i have (4:23 - 4:26)
seen so much i've i watched two twitch (4:24 - 4:28)
streamers play for like 15 minutes each (4:26 - 4:32)
and that was actually really interesting (4:28 - 4:33)
um (4:32 - 4:34)
i mean watching those streamers you felt (4:33 - 4:36)
like you still want to play this game (4:34 - 4:38)
oh it made me want to play the game more (4:36 - 4:40)
nice this is what i want to start off (4:38 - 4:41)
with (4:40 - 4:45)
the i i think that (4:41 - 4:48)
they did probably the worst job in the (4:45 - 4:51)
world marketing this video game (4:48 - 4:53)
i i think the marketing behind this game (4:51 - 4:55)
was so (4:53 - 4:58)
bad and i would say the first trailer (4:55 - 5:00)
was good the second trailer was good i (4:58 - 5:01)
spent an entire twitch stream watching (5:00 - 5:03)
every single trailer and when you watch (5:01 - 5:06)
them all back to back you realize that (5:03 - 5:08)
there's no new footage it is it is all (5:06 - 5:11)
recycled and cut in a way (5:08 - 5:13)
where it's like they're showing the same (5:11 - 5:15)
things over and over the one thing they (5:13 - 5:16)
didn't show (5:15 - 5:17)
which (5:16 - 5:19)
is something i saw through just like (5:17 - 5:21)
maybe like three minutes watching (5:19 - 5:23)
somebody's like just clicking on a (5:21 - 5:24)
twitch stream and watching somebody was (5:23 - 5:26)
going into a pokemon battle doing the (5:24 - 5:29)
battle and exiting the battle that thing (5:26 - 5:32)
alone sold me on the entire game (5:29 - 5:34)
of house very little (5:32 - 5:36)
there's very little gameplay at all in (5:34 - 5:38)
the trailers like when you actually (5:36 - 5:40)
watch some gameplay you realize how (5:38 - 5:41)
little of the trailers were gameplay (5:40 - 5:44)
yeah okay sure you're walking around on (5:41 - 5:45)
weird air you're going on basket legion (5:44 - 5:46)
but (5:45 - 5:48)
they don't as you say they don't show (5:46 - 5:49)
any battles they don't show really (5:48 - 5:51)
there's like a little bit of catching (5:49 - 5:53)
but very little of it and there's some (5:51 - 5:55)
of sneaking that's it there's there's (5:53 - 5:58)
nothing else shown (5:55 - 5:58)
yeah it's it's (5:58 - 6:02)
like (6:01 - 6:04)
also if you've only looked at the (6:02 - 6:05)
trailers you're like wow this game is (6:04 - 6:08)
just shanks and starlight nothing else (6:05 - 6:10)
so i'm badoof um (6:08 - 6:13)
there is a possibility that rather than (6:10 - 6:16)
going for day one sales and trying to (6:13 - 6:17)
like ramp up that everybody get it right (6:16 - 6:20)
away they're actually hoping more that (6:17 - 6:23)
like early adopters get it first and (6:20 - 6:24)
then everybody's talking about how great (6:23 - 6:26)
it is and that leads to greater (6:24 - 6:27)
downstream sales (6:26 - 6:29)
post day one (6:27 - 6:31)
i mean these aren't books right they (6:29 - 6:32)
don't need to get on the new york times (6:31 - 6:36)
bestseller list so yeah it's (6:32 - 6:39)
it's just like (6:36 - 6:39)
if you if you go back and listen to (6:40 - 6:45)
these podcast episodes i was so hesitant (6:41 - 6:47)
to be excited of this game because they (6:45 - 6:49)
showed so little (6:47 - 6:50)
and (6:49 - 6:51)
obviously i want every pokemon game to (6:50 - 6:53)
be good and i've liked (6:51 - 6:56)
probably 95 of pokemon games that have (6:53 - 6:57)
come out (6:56 - 6:59)
um (6:57 - 7:01)
and i would say like the two (6:59 - 7:03)
since doing the podcast i've liked (7:01 - 7:04)
pretty much every single main series (7:03 - 7:05)
game but (7:04 - 7:07)
didn't really love auras didn't really i (7:05 - 7:10)
definitely don't love shining brilliant (7:07 - 7:12)
diamond shining pearl (7:10 - 7:14)
even though i'm still trying to play it (7:12 - 7:15)
um (7:14 - 7:18)
and i was i was worried (7:15 - 7:20)
about liking legends just based off what (7:18 - 7:23)
they shown (7:20 - 7:26)
and now that i've actually seen (7:23 - 7:28)
like like i said maybe 10 minutes of (7:26 - 7:32)
actual gameplay actual gameplay the game (7:28 - 7:34)
looks incredible (7:32 - 7:35)
and that's what the trailers didn't (7:34 - 7:38)
actually show they didn't show any (7:35 - 7:41)
gameplay and and even before i saw the (7:38 - 7:42)
gameplay and i want to start off talking (7:41 - 7:45)
about this (7:42 - 7:47)
weird deer basket legion (7:45 - 7:50)
canadian bravery they're all great (7:47 - 7:52)
but some of the other pokemon that (7:50 - 7:54)
they're hiding (7:52 - 7:56)
absolutely incredible (7:54 - 7:58)
yeah but some of them are weird in a not (7:56 - 8:01)
fun way (7:58 - 8:01)
so i i i wonder and and this is (8:02 - 8:07)
obviously complete speculation and could (8:05 - 8:09)
be utter nonsense and i'm sure that i'll (8:07 - 8:11)
sound like an idiot in a year's time but (8:09 - 8:14)
it almost feels like (8:11 - 8:16)
this the with the marketing and the pr (8:14 - 8:18)
that's happened on this game it almost (8:16 - 8:20)
feels like they don't really care about (8:18 - 8:23)
it and it was almost created as a (8:20 - 8:26)
like a almost a demo for the next game (8:23 - 8:28)
not in so much as like the next game (8:26 - 8:29)
will be a bigger version of that but (8:28 - 8:30)
more (8:29 - 8:32)
it's a lot (8:30 - 8:34)
as part of a new generation of pokemon (8:32 - 8:35)
games you have to build a completely new (8:34 - 8:37)
world you have to build you know what (8:35 - 8:39)
roughly 100 new pokemon (8:37 - 8:41)
um (8:39 - 8:43)
whereas if they were managing to do it (8:41 - 8:45)
in an existing region (8:43 - 8:48)
with almost all the same pokemon (8:45 - 8:49)
you say we're talking about numbers it's (8:48 - 8:52)
like what 10 new pokemon and (8:49 - 8:54)
10 new forms right really almost nothing (8:52 - 8:56)
in compared to a new game (8:54 - 8:58)
there would be a lot less (8:56 - 9:00)
work there and it's almost like this is (8:58 - 9:03)
kind of a test like see whether people (9:00 - 9:04)
like this sort of game (9:03 - 9:07)
to is that how we're going to move on (9:04 - 9:08)
and that would make sense in terms of (9:07 - 9:10)
their they're not spending loads of (9:08 - 9:11)
money in marketing pr because they (9:10 - 9:12)
actually want to see how people like it (9:11 - 9:14)
once it actually comes out kind of like (9:12 - 9:16)
what we're always talking about yeah i (9:14 - 9:18)
could see that (9:16 - 9:21)
i'm just just thinking like reduce the (9:18 - 9:23)
amount of complexity to see if this new (9:21 - 9:25)
format is something that people will (9:23 - 9:26)
enjoy (9:25 - 9:27)
and then worry about expanding (9:26 - 9:31)
complexity after it's been adopted (9:27 - 9:31)
i think you hit the nail on the head (9:33 - 9:37)
right there al of if (9:35 - 9:38)
even though (9:37 - 9:41)
this game looks to be somewhat of a (9:38 - 9:42)
departure (9:41 - 9:45)
and have a lot of new things happening (9:42 - 9:47)
in it (9:45 - 9:48)
it just didn't seem like they cared (9:47 - 9:50)
about it (9:48 - 9:52)
well it feels like the developers cared (9:50 - 9:53)
about it (9:52 - 9:55)
right like marketing the marketing in pr (9:53 - 9:56)
yeah (9:55 - 9:58)
it's like like (9:56 - 10:00)
they're just there was that what 13 (9:58 - 10:01)
minute (10:00 - 10:03)
game play (10:01 - 10:05)
video and i reacted to it on youtube (10:03 - 10:08)
it's 13 minutes long reacted to it (10:05 - 10:09)
nothing in that 13 minutes made me (10:08 - 10:11)
excited (10:09 - 10:14)
about the nature's voice (10:11 - 10:16)
about playing this game it wasn't bad it (10:14 - 10:18)
wasn't bad it's just like nothing in (10:16 - 10:20)
there was like oh that seems new that (10:18 - 10:22)
seems cool and like i said when i (10:20 - 10:24)
watched some dude on twitch and all he (10:22 - 10:27)
was doing was exploring whatever zone he (10:24 - 10:29)
was in i don't wanna i'm almost wanna (10:27 - 10:30)
say wild area i don't know what what (10:29 - 10:32)
it's called but like the zone he was in (10:30 - 10:34)
like i watched him (10:32 - 10:36)
throw a pokeball (10:34 - 10:38)
at the rock formation thingy and a (10:36 - 10:41)
scyther popped out and started mining it (10:38 - 10:43)
but he threw the pokeball (10:41 - 10:46)
scyther popped out he kept running (10:43 - 10:47)
and scyther was still mining (10:46 - 10:50)
and then while scyther was mining he (10:47 - 10:53)
threw a pokeball at a parasect (10:50 - 10:56)
the battle thing set up (10:53 - 10:58)
he did like flamewheel against the (10:56 - 11:01)
parasect it one shot it and then before (10:58 - 11:03)
it like fainted and the experience (11:01 - 11:04)
popped up he was walking to another (11:03 - 11:07)
parasite to do the same thing yeah and (11:04 - 11:10)
it was so seamless and so cool (11:07 - 11:14)
and so fast and fluid and like (11:10 - 11:16)
they could have just showed that that (11:14 - 11:19)
was like that was like 45 seconds of (11:16 - 11:21)
gameplay and all he did was mine and (11:19 - 11:23)
kill two parasacks and it looked (11:21 - 11:26)
incredible it looked so great (11:23 - 11:28)
i will say even compared to the lead-up (11:26 - 11:30)
to sword and shield that they they did (11:28 - 11:32)
very little right there was no like (11:30 - 11:34)
24-hour (11:32 - 11:36)
stream of glenwood tangle to introduce (11:34 - 11:40)
any of the new pokemon there was no (11:36 - 11:42)
weird adaptations to their website you (11:40 - 11:44)
know it's just very small scale (11:42 - 11:48)
definitely i agree on that (11:44 - 11:48)
well yeah like like it just it it does (11:48 - 11:54)
seem like in retrospect there they they (11:51 - 11:55)
had like a small marketing budget or (11:54 - 11:57)
they just didn't care they didn't know (11:55 - 11:58)
how to advertise it or they were scared (11:57 - 12:01)
to show certain things like (11:58 - 12:02)
i mean or it could just be that they (12:01 - 12:05)
didn't have people available (12:02 - 12:07)
right it's just like it's the wrong year (12:05 - 12:09)
so it does make it does make perfect (12:07 - 12:11)
sense if (12:09 - 12:14)
if the new the next game is coming out (12:11 - 12:15)
this year (12:14 - 12:17)
and if that's being announced on pokemon (12:15 - 12:18)
day (12:17 - 12:20)
they would have to do a lot of work (12:18 - 12:22)
exactly you know and also the fact that (12:20 - 12:23)
they've just had brilliant diamond (12:22 - 12:25)
shining peril the two games basically (12:23 - 12:27)
overlapped in their release (12:25 - 12:29)
and from announcement to release right (12:27 - 12:31)
we've had two months between the two (12:29 - 12:33)
games but what eight months between the (12:31 - 12:34)
announcement of the two games and the (12:33 - 12:36)
first one coming out so the vast (12:34 - 12:38)
majority of the time both games (12:36 - 12:40)
were coming out at the same time (12:38 - 12:43)
basically (12:40 - 12:45)
yeah which again has always been weird (12:43 - 12:47)
that they're so close together (12:45 - 12:50)
because if there's if they didn't have (12:47 - 12:52)
something else coming out this year (12:50 - 12:55)
why did they need this game to come out (12:52 - 12:57)
so quickly even if you were like well (12:55 - 12:59)
end of quarter which is i think march (12:57 - 13:02)
okay why does it need to come out so (12:59 - 13:05)
close to diamond and pearl (13:02 - 13:08)
uh but that's like marketing (13:05 - 13:09)
and that's whatever we'll we'll never (13:08 - 13:11)
know the answer to that unless there's (13:09 - 13:13)
some big secret in this game of these (13:11 - 13:16)
two games like connecting in a weird way (13:13 - 13:17)
um (13:16 - 13:19)
it'd be extra weird (13:17 - 13:22)
let's talk about the pokemon (13:19 - 13:23)
i don't care about any of these new (13:22 - 13:26)
pokemon except ursa luna we're going to (13:23 - 13:29)
start with ursulina what (13:26 - 13:29)
we're going to have to have some (13:30 - 13:32)
discussions here i think (13:31 - 13:35)
that's the wrong one to care about (13:32 - 13:37)
okay there's actually one true pokemon (13:35 - 13:39)
to care about and it's a white striped (13:37 - 13:43)
masculine that's that's (13:39 - 13:43)
no (13:44 - 13:47)
uh okay let's let's just go through the (13:45 - 13:50)
pokemon here (13:47 - 13:53)
um so we have uh (13:50 - 13:55)
we have let's go through the forums (13:53 - 13:56)
this is (13:55 - 13:59)
a bold choice they did this (13:56 - 14:01)
but we have a (13:59 - 14:03)
suian decidueye (14:01 - 14:05)
which is going to be grass fighting (14:03 - 14:08)
we have a hassuian typhlosion which is (14:05 - 14:10)
fire ghost and then we have a hassuian (14:08 - 14:13)
samurai water dark (14:10 - 14:14)
uh (14:13 - 14:16)
i want to say this is really bold (14:14 - 14:18)
because in the sense (14:16 - 14:21)
you know all three kanto pokemon got (14:18 - 14:23)
gigantomax all three galler pokemon got (14:21 - 14:26)
gigantomax all three hoenn pokemon got (14:23 - 14:27)
megas (14:26 - 14:30)
all three kanto pokemon got megas so it (14:27 - 14:33)
is a little weird that (14:30 - 14:35)
one gen five pokemon gotta form one gen (14:33 - 14:37)
two pokemon gotta form one gen seven (14:35 - 14:39)
pokemon gotta form (14:37 - 14:42)
um but also i (14:39 - 14:44)
don't know meowth has like 17 forums but (14:42 - 14:47)
that i mean these are your starters (14:44 - 14:50)
yeah i i think it's always been weird (14:47 - 14:52)
that they're pulling three starters from (14:50 - 14:53)
three generations these are the three (14:52 - 14:56)
most popular starters of all time i you (14:53 - 14:57)
know (14:56 - 14:58)
i'm not (14:57 - 15:00)
there's (14:58 - 15:02)
i don't think these are the three most (15:00 - 15:05)
popular starters of all time (15:02 - 15:07)
yes (15:05 - 15:10)
my god has always been more popular than (15:07 - 15:12)
charizard to be fair charizard got two (15:10 - 15:15)
megas you know blastoise dinosaur didn't (15:12 - 15:17)
so it's not like there's exceptions here (15:15 - 15:20)
uh we also have a hessian arcanine which (15:17 - 15:22)
is fire rock (15:20 - 15:23)
hissuing electrode which is electric (15:22 - 15:27)
grass there is a hassuian quill fish (15:23 - 15:29)
you know it's very obvious (15:27 - 15:31)
if if you haven't figured it out that (15:29 - 15:34)
the pokemon company loves our show we're (15:31 - 15:36)
the ones that made quill fish popular we (15:34 - 15:39)
made basklin popular we've made we made (15:36 - 15:41)
miraculous and so none of this is true (15:39 - 15:43)
uh history and coal fish is dark poison (15:41 - 15:45)
there's a hassuyan sneasel poison (15:43 - 15:47)
fighting (15:45 - 15:50)
hasuyan liligant which is grass fighting (15:47 - 15:51)
i should (15:50 - 15:53)
clarify that when we're reading these (15:51 - 15:55)
rumors (15:53 - 15:56)
they could be wrong (15:55 - 15:59)
true correct (15:56 - 16:01)
in the way where like what i'm reading (15:59 - 16:03)
is misreported maybe like they for some (16:01 - 16:05)
reason they thought it's fighting and (16:03 - 16:07)
liliganth is actually grass flying i (16:05 - 16:09)
don't think that's the case but (16:07 - 16:11)
technically i think (16:09 - 16:13)
yeah i think the part of the thing is (16:11 - 16:15)
the the rom has leaked so there are (16:13 - 16:17)
literally hundreds of people doing it i (16:15 - 16:18)
think these would be corrected if they (16:17 - 16:23)
were wrong by now yeah i think so too um (16:18 - 16:27)
liliganth is grass fighting (16:23 - 16:28)
uh which bret i think that's bright loom (16:27 - 16:30)
already has that also history and this (16:28 - 16:32)
is gy uh (16:30 - 16:35)
there's a hassuian slagu which is dragon (16:32 - 16:37)
steel and a hissuian gudra which is (16:35 - 16:39)
ultra dragon steel (16:37 - 16:41)
and then there's a hissuian avalog which (16:39 - 16:44)
is ice rock so those are all your forms (16:41 - 16:46)
or your hisoian forms sorry (16:44 - 16:48)
and then we have some new pokemon which (16:46 - 16:50)
is um (16:48 - 16:52)
weird deer normal psychic vasculation (16:50 - 16:56)
water ghost cleaver bug rock ursa luna (16:52 - 16:57)
normal ground (16:56 - 17:00)
sneezeler poison fighting (16:57 - 17:02)
and overquill (17:00 - 17:04)
dark poison and then finally it looks (17:02 - 17:06)
there to be a new legend i'm gonna go (17:04 - 17:08)
out on a limb and say this pokemon is (17:06 - 17:09)
legendary (17:08 - 17:12)
uh which is an amorous which is fairy (17:09 - 17:13)
flying (17:12 - 17:14)
so (17:13 - 17:16)
that's akami right can we all agree that (17:14 - 17:19)
that's a commie (17:16 - 17:19)
i mean the fact that it has what is (17:29 - 17:33)
called a fairy and full yes it kind of (17:31 - 17:36)
gives it away (17:33 - 17:39)
oh also the what is the the the quill (17:36 - 17:40)
uh (17:39 - 17:41)
overquilt (17:40 - 17:44)
over quilt it's not a syndical evolution (17:41 - 17:47)
that's the evolution of quill fish yes (17:44 - 17:48)
just to be clear (17:47 - 17:50)
so (17:48 - 17:51)
absolutely amazing name by the way over (17:50 - 17:52)
queen (17:51 - 17:55)
i think ursulina is a super good name (17:52 - 17:57)
but the problem is they took away the (17:55 - 17:58)
moon (17:57 - 18:00)
no he has a full moon on his head with (17:58 - 18:03)
like little clouds in front of it (18:00 - 18:06)
yeah see it's a good design (18:03 - 18:08)
um (18:06 - 18:09)
so i (18:08 - 18:12)
was the best of them no (18:09 - 18:14)
is the weirdest of them it is so creepy (18:12 - 18:17)
great no it's too creepy (18:14 - 18:20)
so so i thought that maybe voltorb or (18:17 - 18:23)
growlithe would get that that berserker (18:20 - 18:24)
treatment (18:23 - 18:26)
um (18:24 - 18:29)
but it was sneasel that did sneezel got (18:26 - 18:33)
the berserker treatment here uh which is (18:29 - 18:35)
okay cool i guess and then (18:33 - 18:38)
um i didn't think baskelin would get uh (18:35 - 18:39)
oh that wasn't listed see it wasn't (18:38 - 18:42)
listen to the notes that jesus baskelin (18:39 - 18:44)
it is white stripe masculine is from (18:42 - 18:46)
what i saw (18:44 - 18:47)
uh because everybody keeps forgetting (18:46 - 18:51)
about it yeah i just love how like (18:47 - 18:52)
his face (18:51 - 18:54)
his face is so good (18:52 - 18:57)
do you find it at the hotel yorba (18:54 - 19:00)
this this is for us early 2000s kids you (18:57 - 19:02)
guys (19:00 - 19:03)
so yeah i thought i thought i thought (19:02 - 19:05)
growlithe or voltorb would get like that (19:03 - 19:08)
weird split thing it was sneezel (19:05 - 19:10)
um cool to see quail fish get an (19:08 - 19:11)
evolution (19:10 - 19:12)
um (19:11 - 19:14)
i i think i don't know maybe you do know (19:12 - 19:16)
al because if it's not listed here (19:14 - 19:18)
ursuluna is just the evolution of (19:16 - 19:20)
ursaring right it's not a split yeah (19:18 - 19:23)
yeah they showed earth's ring in some of (19:20 - 19:25)
the images so yeah i think yeah it's (19:23 - 19:28)
it's an evil it's an evolution (19:25 - 19:29)
um which is the (19:28 - 19:31)
what we're calling that we're calling (19:29 - 19:35)
that the uh obstagoon treatment (19:31 - 19:35)
well it's slightly different because (19:35 - 19:39)
ursula ring doesn't have a form (19:37 - 19:40)
a new form (19:39 - 19:42)
oh that's true that's true that's true (19:40 - 19:44)
because they have the so i mean it's (19:42 - 19:47)
just it's basically like uh uh trying to (19:44 - 19:48)
think of (19:47 - 19:51)
yeah yeah exactly yeah (19:48 - 19:51)
uh okay uh what what do we want to talk (19:51 - 19:56)
about there's there's a handful of new (19:54 - 19:58)
pokemon a (19:56 - 20:00)
handful of hassuing forms it looks to be (19:58 - 20:02)
a new legend (20:00 - 20:04)
there (20:02 - 20:06)
there is the weird thing going on with (20:04 - 20:08)
the alga and palkia i like are those (20:06 - 20:12)
hissuian forms of dialga and palkia (20:08 - 20:15)
are we talking about this because (20:12 - 20:15)
it is story tied (20:16 - 20:20)
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna just say that (20:18 - 20:21)
like (20:20 - 20:22)
this is what we'll say about diago (20:21 - 20:24)
palkia because i think obviously if you (20:22 - 20:27)
look at them you you can't help but look (20:24 - 20:29)
that they have the arceus rings around (20:27 - 20:30)
their stomach (20:29 - 20:31)
yeah (20:30 - 20:32)
um (20:31 - 20:34)
they're very cool looking they're very (20:32 - 20:37)
large in game they're very very big (20:34 - 20:39)
but let's i guess that's where we leave (20:37 - 20:41)
it like it's very obvious that they're (20:39 - 20:44)
somehow tied to arceus and their forms (20:41 - 20:47)
yeah i guess (20:44 - 20:47)
they also look less weird in games so if (20:47 - 20:52)
the first time i saw them was just the (20:50 - 20:54)
images yeah um like the models and they (20:52 - 20:56)
looked incredibly weird but when you (20:54 - 20:57)
actually see them in a screenshot in the (20:56 - 20:59)
game they look less weird (20:57 - 21:01)
yes (20:59 - 21:03)
i (21:01 - 21:06)
saw a cut scene with one of them (21:03 - 21:07)
and not i don't want to spoil that (21:06 - 21:10)
cutscene but (21:07 - 21:12)
my worries about the game being (21:10 - 21:15)
bad graphically (21:12 - 21:15)
were (21:15 - 21:18)
were like eased because that cut scene (21:15 - 21:19)
was (21:18 - 21:22)
incredible it just looked gorgeous can (21:19 - 21:25)
we travel back in time to when steve was (21:22 - 21:28)
complaining about how bad the graphics (21:25 - 21:31)
were in the first trailer and just smack (21:28 - 21:32)
that dude (21:31 - 21:34)
okay (21:32 - 21:36)
okay okay we're fine we all agree you're (21:34 - 21:38)
good yes here here's here's what i will (21:36 - 21:40)
say remember when we all looked at sword (21:38 - 21:41)
and shield and we were like this game (21:40 - 21:43)
looks bad and the trees look bad because (21:41 - 21:45)
i never said that no and everyone was (21:43 - 21:48)
like oh they'll fix the trees (21:45 - 21:49)
they didn't fix the trees the trees and (21:48 - 21:50)
sword and shields would look bad that's (21:49 - 21:52)
fine i will say that legends looks (21:50 - 21:55)
better after now seeing people play it (21:52 - 21:57)
except the water still looks bad (21:55 - 21:59)
like everything looks really good except (21:57 - 22:00)
the water looks like kind of awful (21:59 - 22:02)
especially compared to diamond and pearl (22:00 - 22:03)
the water looks great in that game the (22:02 - 22:05)
water's definitely just a stylistic (22:03 - 22:07)
choice like i get if you don't like the (22:05 - 22:09)
look of it but it's it's it's not just (22:07 - 22:11)
half done it it really looks like they (22:09 - 22:13)
deliberately made it that way and i (22:11 - 22:16)
quite like it hmm is it like (22:13 - 22:20)
it's like monet water very impressionist (22:16 - 22:23)
yeah the water and wind waker very good (22:20 - 22:25)
that's all shaded waves loved it (22:23 - 22:27)
i mean sure but you can have you can (22:25 - 22:29)
have different water that all look good (22:27 - 22:31)
like i also like the water in (22:29 - 22:33)
brilliant diamond shining peril i think (22:31 - 22:34)
that's great as well but they're great (22:33 - 22:36)
in different ways (22:34 - 22:37)
and i think if you took that water and (22:36 - 22:39)
put it in legends our case it would look (22:37 - 22:41)
really weird yeah i don't know maybe i (22:39 - 22:42)
guess i prefer the sword and shield (22:41 - 22:43)
water (22:42 - 22:46)
i thought this water looked fine (22:43 - 22:47)
um (22:46 - 22:49)
okay so we won't talk about uh dialga (22:47 - 22:50)
palkia but (22:49 - 22:52)
what do what we want to start off with (22:50 - 22:53)
starters (22:52 - 22:55)
uh (22:53 - 22:58)
yeah i think it's interesting the the (22:55 - 23:00)
starter designs are (22:58 - 23:02)
not humongously different (23:00 - 23:03)
from their original ones (23:02 - 23:06)
why is it deciduous is quite different (23:03 - 23:08)
but the other two they don't look (23:06 - 23:09)
drastically different if you just kind (23:08 - 23:11)
of glance over them you don't notice (23:09 - 23:13)
that it's hugely different which is (23:11 - 23:15)
interesting (23:13 - 23:16)
um i do like what they've done with this (23:15 - 23:19)
city it's clearly a land word now (23:16 - 23:21)
yeah this is why i think ended up being (23:19 - 23:22)
the coolest here (23:21 - 23:25)
uh it did look like um (23:22 - 23:26)
gosh there was like a there was like a (23:25 - 23:29)
samurai game that came out on ps4 ps5 or (23:26 - 23:32)
ps4 recently they like hyped it up (23:29 - 23:34)
um but it just reminded me of that of (23:32 - 23:35)
like well it's that it's that (23:34 - 23:37)
traditional hat (23:35 - 23:42)
style with the color hat cloak yeah (23:37 - 23:44)
um i mean the the unfortunate thing is (23:42 - 23:47)
the cool thing of decidueye was it being (23:44 - 23:49)
grass ghost and they've taken that away (23:47 - 23:51)
so it's not cool anymore but it's an (23:49 - 23:54)
interesting design sure (23:51 - 23:56)
i also like how they flipped the normal (23:54 - 23:59)
and shiny colors (23:56 - 24:00)
oh i didn't see any of the shinies of (23:59 - 24:02)
these new ones yeah the shiny is the (24:00 - 24:06)
green original color that's very cool (24:02 - 24:07)
which is actually funny because the (24:06 - 24:09)
original leaks uh flipped them (24:07 - 24:10)
accidentally because they saw the green (24:09 - 24:12)
and assumed that was the normal one oh (24:10 - 24:14)
that's so funny (24:12 - 24:15)
yeah no i didn't see the shinies of (24:14 - 24:17)
these uh so the the (24:15 - 24:19)
typhlosion (24:17 - 24:20)
is probably the one everyone looks at (24:19 - 24:23)
and goes why is it so bad until you see (24:20 - 24:25)
it in motion and then you see like the (24:23 - 24:27)
flames come out of it and stuff (24:25 - 24:30)
um also i just didn't remember original (24:27 - 24:31)
typhlosion doesn't have like this weird (24:30 - 24:33)
neck thing that comes down so that's (24:31 - 24:34)
like different (24:33 - 24:37)
weird neck thing that comes down (24:34 - 24:40)
it looks like it's wearing like a choker (24:37 - 24:42)
but the original typhlosion doesn't have (24:40 - 24:43)
anything in its front it's just like all (24:42 - 24:44)
belly (24:43 - 24:45)
yes (24:44 - 24:47)
yeah (24:45 - 24:49)
but it doesn't look (24:47 - 24:51)
that different until like the flames (24:49 - 24:53)
come out and even so it's just like (24:51 - 24:57)
decidueye so different compared (24:53 - 25:00)
oh yeah compared to the samurai and the (24:57 - 25:03)
typhlosion very much so yes (25:00 - 25:05)
samurai almost only looks like they (25:03 - 25:06)
changed some colors (25:05 - 25:08)
and not much else (25:06 - 25:11)
yeah the horn is like (25:08 - 25:13)
like twisted (25:11 - 25:14)
i had to google it to see what the (25:13 - 25:15)
original one was because i was like is (25:14 - 25:17)
this not just the original they had a (25:15 - 25:20)
chance this was the chance to like save (25:17 - 25:21)
samurai (25:20 - 25:23)
oh because there's nothing wrong with (25:21 - 25:24)
samurai (25:23 - 25:28)
it's not great (25:24 - 25:28)
they could have went they could have (25:28 - 25:32)
went went to like wet and wild with sam (25:29 - 25:33)
rotten they were just like ah it's (25:32 - 25:35)
slightly darker and like we twisted its (25:33 - 25:37)
horns we gave it like a big mustache (25:35 - 25:39)
like if you look at all the final (25:37 - 25:41)
evolutions for all the starters a lot of (25:39 - 25:43)
them are not great (25:41 - 25:46)
what so (25:43 - 25:47)
who (25:46 - 25:50)
decidueye original decidueye great yes (25:47 - 25:51)
yeah incredible (25:50 - 25:54)
uh who's the drum dude nobody likes the (25:51 - 25:55)
drum dude (25:54 - 25:57)
rilla (25:55 - 25:57)
italian was one of those pokemon and (26:07 - 26:10)
sword and shield that looked complete (26:08 - 26:12)
trash until you saw it in motion and (26:10 - 26:15)
then like it moving like really saved it (26:12 - 26:16)
see the thing about starters is they (26:15 - 26:18)
make the original super cute and then (26:16 - 26:20)
you're disappointed when they evolve (26:18 - 26:23)
that's because you know that's true so (26:20 - 26:24)
i (26:23 - 26:27)
also okay so the the thing also about (26:24 - 26:28)
this game that we're going to get to is (26:27 - 26:32)
that the sizes are accurate (26:28 - 26:32)
or or should be accurate i guess like um (26:32 - 26:37)
maybe (26:36 - 26:38)
you've got to rephrase that for people (26:37 - 26:40)
who haven't seen the spoilers (26:38 - 26:44)
the sizes that you see on the screen (26:40 - 26:46)
are accurate (26:44 - 26:49)
so if you're standing next to a pokemon (26:46 - 26:51)
that's large it's larger than you if (26:49 - 26:53)
you're standing next to a pokemon that's (26:51 - 26:55)
small it's smaller than you so they're (26:53 - 26:58)
they're true to scale (26:55 - 27:00)
i would say that let's go was accurate (26:58 - 27:03)
to scale like when onyx came out you (27:00 - 27:05)
were taller than a building and sitting (27:03 - 27:06)
on the onyx (27:05 - 27:08)
when like snorlax came out like snorlax (27:06 - 27:10)
was like twice your size and you like (27:08 - 27:12)
grabbed on to them yeah arcanine was (27:10 - 27:16)
like really big and you wrote it (27:12 - 27:16)
so like joltik was never to i mean it (27:18 - 27:22)
wouldn't have been in the game but if if (27:20 - 27:23)
they've done that they know never would (27:22 - 27:25)
have done joltik to scale right because (27:23 - 27:26)
is it not like (27:25 - 27:28)
absolutely tiny yeah it's like four (27:26 - 27:30)
inches i think yeah they could never (27:28 - 27:31)
have done that in game that's you know (27:30 - 27:33)
freedom units there (27:31 - 27:35)
um (27:33 - 27:37)
in sword and shield joltik is really (27:35 - 27:39)
tiny but probably not the tiny it should (27:37 - 27:41)
be but also in sword and shield like (27:39 - 27:44)
zekram and reshram should be much bigger (27:41 - 27:46)
but they're not like huge huge (27:44 - 27:48)
and i think stackataka is very big in (27:46 - 27:50)
sword and shield but not the size it (27:48 - 27:52)
should be from the couple of screenshots (27:50 - 27:54)
i've seen (27:52 - 27:55)
like (27:54 - 27:58)
there are pokemon that should that in (27:55 - 27:59)
sword and shield or even in let's go (27:58 - 28:02)
were never that big and in in this game (27:59 - 28:06)
they are like towering over you (28:02 - 28:08)
yeah (28:06 - 28:09)
are we talking alphas as well if we're (28:08 - 28:12)
talking sizes so you link that in there (28:09 - 28:14)
yeah yeah in the because because that (28:12 - 28:16)
is something else to bear in mind is (28:14 - 28:17)
it's possible you might have seen one of (28:16 - 28:20)
an alpha because they're they are bigger (28:17 - 28:21)
um (28:20 - 28:23)
than the normal ones (28:21 - 28:24)
like and not just like they are they're (28:23 - 28:26)
scaled so it's interesting because we're (28:24 - 28:28)
talking we were talking about there was (28:26 - 28:29)
the (28:28 - 28:31)
random gif i think they had on on (28:29 - 28:33)
twitter months ago about the different (28:31 - 28:36)
sized voltorbs (28:33 - 28:37)
and we were and you were discussing (28:36 - 28:39)
whether or not they would actually be (28:37 - 28:40)
different sizes in game and it turns out (28:39 - 28:42)
they are you can have different sized (28:40 - 28:46)
ones but also for like every pokemon not (28:42 - 28:48)
voltorb oh wait so sweet yes crazy part (28:46 - 28:51)
yeah so there's three things to to cover (28:48 - 28:53)
here to clarify for people number one (28:51 - 28:56)
when you see the pokemon in the world (28:53 - 28:59)
they are to scale comparative to you (28:56 - 29:01)
compared to the surroundings number two (28:59 - 29:03)
the pokemon in the world come in (29:01 - 29:04)
different sizes (29:03 - 29:07)
so i think we what we saw was like the (29:04 - 29:09)
eevee there's one that's like 10 inches (29:07 - 29:10)
there's one that's like a foot there's (29:09 - 29:13)
one that's slightly larger than a foot (29:10 - 29:15)
and then the third thing is there are (29:13 - 29:17)
alpha pokemon which i i thought there (29:15 - 29:18)
were only going to be a few alpha (29:17 - 29:20)
pokemon but it looks like there's alphas (29:18 - 29:22)
of everything (29:20 - 29:24)
every single pokemon can be an alpha (29:22 - 29:26)
yeah the alpha pokemon are just bigger (29:24 - 29:28)
than (29:26 - 29:30)
they're huge they can they can be much (29:28 - 29:32)
bigger like there was an image i saw of (29:30 - 29:33)
an alpha bidoof that was the pa size of (29:32 - 29:36)
a person yeah it was like absolutely (29:33 - 29:37)
massive (29:36 - 29:39)
yeah yeah (29:37 - 29:42)
but that goes back to the samurai (29:39 - 29:45)
samurai is tiny in this game (29:42 - 29:47)
like he looks like a dog (29:45 - 29:49)
well how big did you think samurai was (29:47 - 29:50)
supposed to be (29:49 - 29:53)
samurai i feel like is like rideable (29:50 - 29:55)
like you could probably fit two people (29:53 - 29:57)
on the back of the samurai i mean you (29:55 - 29:59)
could ride something like (29:57 - 29:59)
one (29:59 - 30:02)
[Laughter] (29:59 - 30:04)
samurai is four foot 11 inches (30:02 - 30:08)
yeah that's tiny 1.5 meters for our (30:04 - 30:10)
international listeners yes that's why (30:08 - 30:13)
al is here to convert on the fly (30:10 - 30:16)
no i look top as well (30:13 - 30:16)
um (30:16 - 30:21)
i you know like (30:17 - 30:21)
i i i don't know if i have a i don't (30:21 - 30:25)
know if the hassuian forms of these (30:23 - 30:27)
three starters change who i personally (30:25 - 30:29)
would have started with i think i would (30:27 - 30:30)
have probably still started with oshawa (30:29 - 30:32)
because i do like oshawa genuinely as a (30:30 - 30:35)
starter i'm not a samurai over the years (30:32 - 30:37)
have has definitely grown on me (30:35 - 30:39)
um (30:37 - 30:39)
history and samurai not like doing it (30:40 - 30:45)
for me though oh yeah this is definitely (30:42 - 30:46)
changed because i was definitely going (30:45 - 30:49)
to do rowlet and now it's like i don't (30:46 - 30:51)
want fighting grass i would much rather (30:49 - 30:54)
have ghost fire so i'm back to cinciquel (30:51 - 30:56)
so it's interesting it's changed me but (30:54 - 30:57)
the other way around i was going to go (30:56 - 30:58)
for cinder coil because i always do the (30:57 - 31:01)
fire starter but his suing decidueye is (30:58 - 31:03)
just too cool for me not to (31:01 - 31:06)
pick and we got one of each excellent (31:03 - 31:08)
perfect (31:06 - 31:10)
the (31:08 - 31:12)
so we we talked about the sizes (31:10 - 31:13)
um (31:12 - 31:15)
and we were talking about before the (31:13 - 31:17)
show i i really feel like the size thing (31:15 - 31:19)
is something they've wanted to do for a (31:17 - 31:21)
while and and i remember when let's go (31:19 - 31:23)
pikachu let's go eevee came out and it (31:21 - 31:25)
would it would say on screen like extra (31:23 - 31:28)
tiny tiny large extra large it's huge or (31:25 - 31:30)
whatever it would say (31:28 - 31:33)
and i thought that was like (31:30 - 31:35)
when when i first played it i was like (31:33 - 31:37)
wow that's cool like look at this tiny (31:35 - 31:40)
pidgey and then you realize that (31:37 - 31:43)
it's just like the same (31:40 - 31:45)
they're all the same size (31:43 - 31:46)
and it's like why did they put the (31:45 - 31:48)
effort into animating like it's huge (31:46 - 31:51)
it's tiny it's small because it doesn't (31:48 - 31:54)
really do anything uh um there was (31:51 - 31:55)
something (31:54 - 31:57)
something about (31:55 - 31:58)
when you caught them at different sizes (31:57 - 32:00)
something happened i don't remember (31:58 - 32:02)
exactly what it was like the rewards (32:00 - 32:04)
that you got or something the rewards i (32:02 - 32:05)
think yeah (32:04 - 32:08)
i think you got like more candy the (32:05 - 32:10)
bigger it was or something of the sort (32:08 - 32:12)
um but also in pokemon go that was like (32:10 - 32:15)
a thing that they've done like catch 300 (32:12 - 32:19)
tiny rattatas catch 300 big magikarps (32:15 - 32:20)
and it's it's so it's something that (32:19 - 32:23)
pokemon as a franchise has (32:20 - 32:23)
has (32:23 - 32:25)
played with (32:23 - 32:27)
and (32:25 - 32:29)
i'm curious if that was like something (32:27 - 32:32)
they wanted to get done in let's go (32:29 - 32:33)
but they just didn't have enough time to (32:32 - 32:35)
like make five different sizes of (32:33 - 32:36)
machoque and five different sizes of (32:35 - 32:38)
machamp and five different sizes of (32:36 - 32:41)
of machop and now apply that to like (32:38 - 32:43)
however many pokemon (32:41 - 32:44)
but in this game you like like we said (32:43 - 32:46)
earlier there's three different size (32:44 - 32:48)
eevees (32:46 - 32:50)
and that's not even including the alpha (32:48 - 32:52)
ev that you can catch it's like really (32:50 - 32:53)
cool (32:52 - 32:55)
yeah and which they could also be (32:53 - 32:57)
i mean they couldn't (32:55 - 32:59)
because of the size of the pokedex right (32:57 - 33:01)
they could be procedurally generated (32:59 - 33:03)
within a range right it's like when you (33:01 - 33:06)
spawn an eevee make it between eight (33:03 - 33:08)
inches and (33:06 - 33:11)
uh one point one foot (33:08 - 33:13)
six inches right and it can be anywhere (33:11 - 33:16)
in that range (33:13 - 33:16)
yeah (33:16 - 33:20)
yeah i've not actually seen exactly how (33:18 - 33:22)
that's done uh we've not had any proper (33:20 - 33:25)
data mines but um it certainly looks to (33:22 - 33:27)
me like it's not just set sizes and more (33:25 - 33:29)
a range like you say but (33:27 - 33:31)
yeah this one for that (33:29 - 33:34)
here is one foot one inch 14.5 pounds (33:31 - 33:37)
and then this ev is one foot (33:34 - 33:40)
14.8 pounds so it's a smaller ev but (33:37 - 33:42)
weighs more oh (33:40 - 33:45)
it's it's more muscular and then this eb (33:42 - 33:47)
is 10 inches (33:45 - 33:51)
and 14 pounds (33:47 - 33:52)
so it looks like they also have (33:51 - 33:54)
different weight now the question is (33:52 - 33:56)
does the weight matter when you're using (33:54 - 33:58)
a move like (33:56 - 34:01)
heavy slam if that move exists in the (33:58 - 34:03)
game yes right (34:01 - 34:05)
and then there's a screenshot of (34:03 - 34:07)
um three (34:05 - 34:09)
lux rays one is obviously an alpha (34:07 - 34:11)
because it's like bigger than the tree (34:09 - 34:13)
and then one's a shiny lux ray which is (34:11 - 34:16)
a little smaller than a normal x-ray (34:13 - 34:16)
uh (34:16 - 34:19)
they have like this (34:16 - 34:20)
alpha hair cross which is like three (34:19 - 34:24)
times the size of a regular hair across (34:20 - 34:28)
it's it's really cool but also a little (34:24 - 34:30)
bit jarring to see (34:28 - 34:31)
like (34:30 - 34:34)
like how big they are compared to you (34:31 - 34:35)
like ursa ring is already bigger than (34:34 - 34:37)
the character and then alpha or soring (34:35 - 34:40)
is like just towering over you and it's (34:37 - 34:43)
really cool and again (34:40 - 34:46)
why wasn't this shown like why was this (34:43 - 34:48)
not just in the trailer and like (34:46 - 34:50)
they didn't have to bring attention to (34:48 - 34:51)
it they didn't have to be like look at (34:50 - 34:53)
these are like but look at they did (34:51 - 34:57)
chunky pacharisu and been like (34:53 - 34:58)
the funny thing is they did bring (34:57 - 35:01)
attention to it but in such a weird way (34:58 - 35:02)
with the vault up but that was it it was (35:01 - 35:05)
literally this one tiny shot for two (35:02 - 35:08)
seconds of the character with five (35:05 - 35:10)
voltorb around them that was it no (35:08 - 35:11)
mention of anything because even at the (35:10 - 35:12)
time you were discussing whether that (35:11 - 35:14)
was even going to be real or whether it (35:12 - 35:15)
was just like a cutscene or something (35:14 - 35:18)
like that right right yeah yeah i just (35:15 - 35:18)
have to (35:18 - 35:20)
like the one thing i would always keep (35:18 - 35:22)
in mind as like (35:20 - 35:24)
you know the the disappointment of it (35:22 - 35:27)
all is that japan was on serious (35:24 - 35:29)
lockdown for the past year and maybe (35:27 - 35:30)
they just couldn't (35:29 - 35:33)
do the same level of marketing (35:30 - 35:34)
development that they would normally (35:33 - 35:37)
have been able to do (35:34 - 35:37)
yeah maybe (35:37 - 35:40)
you just can't hold them to the same (35:39 - 35:41)
standards i think the problem with (35:40 - 35:44)
voltorb is they did it on a new pokemon (35:41 - 35:46)
and that was probably intentional (35:44 - 35:48)
because if they did it on like pacharisu (35:46 - 35:49)
you'd be like why are those two (35:48 - 35:51)
pachirisu's different sizes (35:49 - 35:53)
because we know what pacharis has always (35:51 - 35:53)
been (35:53 - 35:55)
but they were like here's a new pokemon (35:53 - 35:56)
here's voltorb (35:55 - 35:59)
and it's like oh i don't is this just (35:56 - 36:01)
a thing to voltorb because it's new or (35:59 - 36:02)
is it (36:01 - 36:04)
is this is this in game is this a cut (36:02 - 36:06)
scene is this is a still did somebody (36:04 - 36:09)
mess up hey we all watched a 24 hour (36:06 - 36:11)
live stream of a ponyta and then at the (36:09 - 36:13)
end of that live stream one of those (36:11 - 36:14)
ponytas didn't have a tail (36:13 - 36:17)
[Laughter] (36:14 - 36:19)
and then we were like maybe that one's (36:17 - 36:21)
the boy and then the girl has it like (36:19 - 36:24)
they've messed up before (36:21 - 36:24)
i don't think that was a mess up i think (36:25 - 36:28)
that that got them a lot of uh a lot of (36:26 - 36:30)
discussion (36:28 - 36:33)
my real problem with alpha pokemon is (36:30 - 36:34)
that (36:33 - 36:36)
i'm gonna have a real problem trying to (36:34 - 36:37)
play through this game with anything (36:36 - 36:41)
other than alpha pokemon (36:37 - 36:41)
i know absolutely it's a me issue i'm (36:42 - 36:46)
not debating that i'm just saying it's (36:44 - 36:48)
an issue uh so that's that's going to be (36:46 - 36:51)
a real struggle for me (36:48 - 36:51)
is this where we okay so so we talked (36:53 - 36:56)
about different sizes (36:55 - 37:00)
talked about alpha pokemon (36:56 - 37:01)
the thing that (37:00 - 37:04)
worried me the entire last year (37:01 - 37:07)
and the thing they still up to this date (37:04 - 37:09)
this game comes out in five days they (37:07 - 37:11)
haven't talked about (37:09 - 37:13)
the pokedex (37:11 - 37:14)
and it's (37:13 - 37:17)
it like i've been so positive up to this (37:14 - 37:19)
point and i'm still positive and (37:17 - 37:21)
optimistic now about this game like (37:19 - 37:22)
seeing seeing somebody play this game (37:21 - 37:24)
for 15 minutes i am sold this looks like (37:22 - 37:27)
one of the best pokemon games (37:24 - 37:28)
in a long time i love sword and shield i (37:27 - 37:30)
don't know if it will be better for me (37:28 - 37:31)
than sword and shield because there's a (37:30 - 37:32)
lot this game is missing i don't know (37:31 - 37:35)
maybe like battling other people doesn't (37:32 - 37:36)
actually exist like you can't battle any (37:35 - 37:38)
people um (37:36 - 37:40)
it sounds like there's no health well (37:38 - 37:42)
you can't battle like humans (37:40 - 37:45)
like other like real competitive yeah (37:42 - 37:47)
yeah like competitive okay i think men (37:45 - 37:48)
in game (37:47 - 37:50)
yeah no there there it looks like there (37:48 - 37:52)
are trainers not a lot but it looks like (37:50 - 37:54)
there are some trainers like there's (37:52 - 37:55)
like a dojo (37:54 - 37:59)
there definitely are trainers to battle (37:55 - 38:00)
yeah (37:59 - 38:01)
i'm trying so hard not to say things (38:00 - 38:03)
that might be considered stories (38:01 - 38:05)
it's the problem with reading literally (38:03 - 38:07)
everything yeah (38:05 - 38:08)
i when i watched the dude play for like (38:07 - 38:10)
15 minutes i he didn't run into a single (38:08 - 38:12)
trainer (38:10 - 38:14)
like he battled a bunch of parasects he (38:12 - 38:17)
mined a lot of ore he like (38:14 - 38:20)
got destroyed by a level 50 rose raid (38:17 - 38:22)
and he was like level 35 (38:20 - 38:23)
um (38:22 - 38:25)
and then (38:23 - 38:27)
he like battled an alpha wall reign like (38:25 - 38:29)
there was not i didn't even see a (38:27 - 38:30)
trainer that he walked by (38:29 - 38:33)
um but i think i think it definitely (38:30 - 38:35)
makes sense for the the theme though (38:33 - 38:37)
right like if you're you're kind of (38:35 - 38:38)
seeing this world that is mostly (38:37 - 38:40)
uninhabited with a few areas around the (38:38 - 38:42)
place because it's you know a long time (38:40 - 38:43)
ago (38:42 - 38:44)
of course there's not gonna be trainers (38:43 - 38:46)
every two steps (38:44 - 38:48)
you know like it's there's going to be (38:46 - 38:49)
specific places where you're going to (38:48 - 38:51)
find a bunch of people and you're going (38:49 - 38:53)
to battle them there (38:51 - 38:55)
so the so obviously with the leaks the (38:53 - 38:59)
pokedex leaked uh it is 240 pokemon (38:55 - 39:00)
there are two mythical pokemon so (38:59 - 39:02)
technically 242. (39:00 - 39:04)
um (39:02 - 39:04)
that's a small pokedex (39:05 - 39:11)
manageable pokedex is what that is that (39:08 - 39:13)
you you could maybe say like oh the (39:11 - 39:16)
black and white pokedex was 156. (39:13 - 39:19)
yeah and they they kind of lied slash (39:16 - 39:21)
didn't tell people that oh the entire (39:19 - 39:24)
pokedex is available once you beat the (39:21 - 39:26)
elite four (39:24 - 39:28)
but what was black and white at the end (39:26 - 39:30)
of that game like (39:28 - 39:33)
596 pokemon or something (39:30 - 39:37)
at the end of black and white 649. 649. (39:33 - 39:39)
yeah we had a whole thing (39:37 - 39:42)
about that yeah (39:39 - 39:43)
so yeah so black and white is like close (39:42 - 39:45)
to (39:43 - 39:48)
700 or 650 pokemon (39:45 - 39:51)
uh what was diamond and pearl 494.93 (39:48 - 39:51)
right (39:51 - 39:54)
brilliant diamond shining pearls 493. (39:51 - 39:57)
sword and shield was 400 (39:54 - 40:01)
and then each dlc added about 100 each (39:57 - 40:03)
so that's 600 so sword and shield's (40:01 - 40:06)
missing like 250 or something like that (40:03 - 40:08)
um (40:06 - 40:10)
red blue yellow (40:08 - 40:14)
uh let's go pikachu let's go eevee 150 i (40:10 - 40:16)
mean let's go pikachu let's go ev153 (40:14 - 40:19)
because it has mel tan bell metal (40:16 - 40:19)
heart gold soul silver is (40:20 - 40:25)
not even 250 because it has (40:22 - 40:27)
all the gen like (40:25 - 40:31)
ruby or crystal is 250 251 technically (40:27 - 40:34)
so this is this is the second (40:31 - 40:36)
smallest pokedex ever (40:34 - 40:38)
if we're counting we're putting all gen (40:36 - 40:39)
one (40:38 - 40:41)
into like let's go pikachu let's go even (40:39 - 40:43)
red blue yellow into a bucket (40:41 - 40:45)
this is (40:43 - 40:47)
a small pokedex (40:45 - 40:49)
it is (40:47 - 40:51)
but it's like we're coming from a time (40:49 - 40:53)
when pokedex completion has been too (40:51 - 40:55)
hard for most people to (40:53 - 40:57)
they just it's just give up (40:55 - 40:58)
because it's too much (40:57 - 41:00)
yeah (40:58 - 41:01)
i mean (41:00 - 41:02)
that's what black and that's what not (41:01 - 41:04)
black and white that's what sun and moon (41:02 - 41:06)
actually did well is the pokedex (41:04 - 41:08)
here is a (41:06 - 41:10)
what was sun and moon 300 because (41:08 - 41:13)
ultrasound on ultramoon was 400 (41:10 - 41:14)
but again (41:13 - 41:16)
you could still get all the pokemon (41:14 - 41:18)
but sun and moon was like here's (41:16 - 41:20)
oh i'll do ultra because i finished the (41:18 - 41:22)
ultra decks ultra was here's 400 pokemon (41:20 - 41:25)
here's four islands (41:22 - 41:26)
we're breaking it down into all four (41:25 - 41:29)
islands it made it really obtainable and (41:26 - 41:31)
really actually fun to complete that (41:29 - 41:33)
pokedex and then sword and shield (41:31 - 41:35)
carried that on and also did a really (41:33 - 41:37)
good job of like encouraging you to find (41:35 - 41:40)
and catch pokemon and like max raids and (41:37 - 41:42)
um (41:40 - 41:46)
and let's go i mean it's a 153 it's (41:42 - 41:47)
pretty they don't have to push you in a (41:46 - 41:49)
direction you didn't have a lot of (41:47 - 41:51)
options in that game but that's (41:49 - 41:52)
something that they've really done over (41:51 - 41:54)
the years because yeah in x and y in (41:52 - 41:56)
black and white in omega ruby alpha (41:54 - 41:57)
sapphire (41:56 - 42:00)
in shining diamond brilliant (41:57 - 42:02)
brilliant diamond shining pearl that (42:00 - 42:04)
those games are awful to complete the (42:02 - 42:08)
pokedex yes correct (42:04 - 42:08)
yeah i think it's it's interesting (42:09 - 42:12)
because (42:11 - 42:15)
you know the number aside they're (42:12 - 42:17)
clearly continuing down this road of (42:15 - 42:19)
we don't really care about whether you (42:17 - 42:21)
can bring your other pokemon back into (42:19 - 42:23)
this game right which (42:21 - 42:25)
i mean that's a choice (42:23 - 42:27)
i know i like they've clearly they've (42:25 - 42:29)
clearly said it they clearly don't care (42:27 - 42:31)
you know what fine i don't i don't (42:29 - 42:35)
really care either um i think it (42:31 - 42:36)
it would be nice if like the next game (42:35 - 42:39)
that is like the the vgc game did i (42:36 - 42:41)
would be surprised if like the next vgc (42:39 - 42:43)
game didn't give you (42:41 - 42:45)
most of the pokemon like what sword and (42:43 - 42:46)
shield now has (42:45 - 42:47)
because it would be a weird thing for (42:46 - 42:49)
them to go right here is the game that (42:47 - 42:50)
we're going to play battles in and (42:49 - 42:52)
you've got 200 pokemon in them that (42:50 - 42:53)
would be weird (42:52 - 42:56)
um but games like this and and games (42:53 - 42:58)
like brilliant diamond shining peril (42:56 - 43:00)
like i'm actually okay with it like i'm (42:58 - 43:02)
not (43:00 - 43:03)
does it really matter that i can't bring (43:02 - 43:05)
my favorite pokemon in to play the story (43:03 - 43:07)
and then play the post game i mean i (43:05 - 43:09)
know some people really cared a lot (43:07 - 43:10)
about that (43:09 - 43:12)
yeah i mean like maybe maybe like some (43:10 - 43:14)
more pokemon that was the complaints for (43:12 - 43:15)
black and white (43:14 - 43:17)
and that's why black and white was so (43:15 - 43:19)
hated is they were like here's (43:17 - 43:21)
and i i still applaud black and white to (43:19 - 43:25)
this day to be like hey 156 new pokemon (43:21 - 43:27)
like deal with it yeah and i could (43:25 - 43:29)
actually talk for hours about (43:27 - 43:32)
even playing brilliant dining diamond (43:29 - 43:34)
shining pearl how that obviates the need (43:32 - 43:36)
for them to have done black and white (43:34 - 43:37)
the way that they did (43:36 - 43:39)
because you play through it and you're (43:37 - 43:42)
like man same old pokemon (43:39 - 43:43)
yes (43:42 - 43:45)
same old pokemon somebody somebody in my (43:43 - 43:47)
twitch chat (43:45 - 43:49)
went and looked at every single trainer (43:47 - 43:51)
in brilliant diamond shining pearl (43:49 - 43:55)
and geodude is the most used pokemon by (43:51 - 43:58)
trainers in that game (43:55 - 43:59)
um (43:58 - 44:01)
i would wager that geodude is also on (43:59 - 44:03)
the most routes in that game too it's (44:01 - 44:06)
everywhere but it's insane one other (44:03 - 44:08)
thing i would say though is i think the (44:06 - 44:09)
argument of (44:08 - 44:11)
uh i want to be able to play with my (44:09 - 44:13)
favorite pokemon that i collected over (44:11 - 44:15)
the years is actually a sugar coating (44:13 - 44:16)
over (44:15 - 44:19)
a much deeper feeling that people have (44:16 - 44:21)
that they don't want to say (44:19 - 44:22)
which goes back to what we're saying (44:21 - 44:25)
about the size of the pokedex of (44:22 - 44:27)
the pokedex is too large i just want to (44:25 - 44:29)
import everything i already have so i (44:27 - 44:31)
don't have to go through and catch and (44:29 - 44:33)
evolve and do all of that over again (44:31 - 44:36)
that's too much work (44:33 - 44:37)
i think (44:36 - 44:39)
so when i when i heard that the pokedex (44:37 - 44:42)
number was 240 i was like (44:39 - 44:44)
that sucks that was one of the things i (44:42 - 44:47)
was worried the entire year is like and (44:44 - 44:48)
i kind of figured it was going to happen (44:47 - 44:51)
because they refused to talk about it (44:48 - 44:54)
if the pokedex was like 400 they would (44:51 - 44:55)
have said (44:54 - 44:57)
that would have been a selling point (44:55 - 44:59)
catch over 400 pokemon in pokemon (44:57 - 45:00)
legends (44:59 - 45:03)
240 is tiny (45:00 - 45:05)
but they (45:03 - 45:07)
you could you could catch a goodra and (45:05 - 45:09)
then you could catch an alpha goudrea (45:07 - 45:10)
that's that's (45:09 - 45:11)
two different things you could catch if (45:10 - 45:13)
you wanted to (45:11 - 45:14)
and (45:13 - 45:15)
it because these pokemon have different (45:14 - 45:18)
sizes i'm sure that was probably some (45:15 - 45:19)
sort (45:18 - 45:21)
of (45:19 - 45:22)
challenge (45:21 - 45:25)
to make that work and there might be (45:22 - 45:26)
people that will like i want the (45:25 - 45:28)
smallest (45:26 - 45:30)
eevee possible (45:28 - 45:32)
and i want i want i want five small (45:30 - 45:34)
eevees so i can evolve them into five (45:32 - 45:38)
small eeveelutions so there seems to be (45:34 - 45:40)
at least a reason (45:38 - 45:44)
with different sizes and alphas to catch (45:40 - 45:46)
these pokemon (45:44 - 45:47)
twice (45:46 - 45:49)
if you like to catch (45:47 - 45:51)
um (45:49 - 45:54)
so it's it's not concerning in in that (45:51 - 45:57)
way it's still kind of like (45:54 - 45:59)
240 seems small (45:57 - 46:01)
does that mean the game is small (45:59 - 46:03)
because like (46:01 - 46:05)
sword and shield is 400 and that's a (46:03 - 46:07)
very big map and there's a lot of places (46:05 - 46:10)
to go and explore and this is this is (46:07 - 46:12)
like half that (46:10 - 46:13)
but also (46:12 - 46:16)
i will say that like i had more fun with (46:13 - 46:18)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee than i (46:16 - 46:20)
did with brilliant diamond shining pearl (46:18 - 46:24)
one game has 153 the other game has 493. (46:20 - 46:26)
i it's been two months i haven't (46:24 - 46:29)
finished that pokedex it feels (46:26 - 46:32)
impossible and not fun to finish that (46:29 - 46:34)
pokedex because like (46:32 - 46:36)
half of these pokemon are just (46:34 - 46:38)
evolutions and the only way i can evolve (46:36 - 46:40)
is by sticking them a party going to the (46:38 - 46:41)
underground and just spending hours (46:40 - 46:43)
knocking out dooms i don't know how else (46:41 - 46:45)
to evolve them and then my other option (46:43 - 46:47)
to evolve is to start collecting bigger (46:45 - 46:49)
forms (46:47 - 46:50)
that are in the underground like (46:49 - 46:52)
houndoom and then stick them in the (46:50 - 46:54)
daycare and then ride that awful bike (46:52 - 46:56)
until i get an egg so i can get a hound (46:54 - 46:58)
hour because it's the only way to get (46:56 - 47:01)
hound hour so it's like you're (46:58 - 47:02)
two (47:01 - 47:04)
you have two ext the two extremes in (47:02 - 47:05)
those games aren't even like catching (47:04 - 47:08)
it's evolving (47:05 - 47:09)
or (47:08 - 47:12)
breeding well and and they've actually i (47:09 - 47:14)
mean you know we talk about the the (47:12 - 47:16)
grind and wild pokemon it's actually (47:14 - 47:17)
really interesting because you know we (47:16 - 47:19)
mentioned earlier about the (47:17 - 47:21)
the smoothness of of grinding through (47:19 - 47:22)
that (47:21 - 47:24)
i think would make a massive difference (47:22 - 47:27)
to that sort of thing of that you know (47:24 - 47:28)
the general way to get experience in (47:27 - 47:30)
this game is to grind through pokemon (47:28 - 47:32)
much like what you're doing in the (47:30 - 47:33)
underground yeah (47:32 - 47:35)
but you can go through 10 pokemon in the (47:33 - 47:37)
time you would do one in brilliant (47:35 - 47:39)
diamond chaining apparel it it was it (47:37 - 47:40)
was (47:39 - 47:43)
crazy like my i think my brain exploded (47:40 - 47:44)
when i (47:43 - 47:47)
watched the guy enter a battle (47:44 - 47:50)
and then like (47:47 - 47:52)
menu down to flame wheel flame wheel and (47:50 - 47:53)
then start walking away because he knew (47:52 - 47:55)
it was gonna one shot it and then start (47:53 - 47:57)
another battle (47:55 - 47:59)
before that one even seemed to be over (47:57 - 48:02)
and then in in any other pokemon game (47:59 - 48:04)
whether it was let's go or sword and (48:02 - 48:06)
shield or black and white or ruby and (48:04 - 48:08)
sapphire it was (48:06 - 48:10)
walk (48:08 - 48:12)
encounter (48:10 - 48:12)
black screen (48:12 - 48:16)
two pokemon fade in (48:14 - 48:17)
for whatever reason brilliant diamond (48:16 - 48:19)
shining pearl is like hey remember (48:17 - 48:21)
you're a human let me look at you every (48:19 - 48:22)
single time (48:21 - 48:25)
throw out the pokemon look back at you (48:22 - 48:27)
look at the pokemon look back at you (48:25 - 48:29)
look at it's like (48:27 - 48:31)
i just wanna i'm just gonna bubble beam (48:29 - 48:33)
this like dude dude we're gonna move on (48:31 - 48:35)
but it it (48:33 - 48:37)
like that dude legit mind and knocked (48:35 - 48:39)
out two parasites probably before you (48:37 - 48:41)
could even get into a battle in like (48:39 - 48:43)
let's go again in brilliant it was (48:41 - 48:45)
insane (48:43 - 48:47)
yeah the thing that's been killing me is (48:45 - 48:49)
i've been radaring in brilliant diamond (48:47 - 48:51)
shining parallel and just the amount of (48:49 - 48:53)
time you have to wait showing your (48:51 - 48:55)
experience gains (48:53 - 48:56)
and your button mashing trying to get it (48:55 - 48:59)
away as quickly as possible and yet it's (48:56 - 49:00)
the fact that in this game it just it (48:59 - 49:02)
just pops up on the screen just shows (49:00 - 49:04)
you at the top right there you go (49:02 - 49:06)
there's your experience good move on (49:04 - 49:09)
fantastic done (49:06 - 49:09)
i i still think (49:10 - 49:14)
gen 9 will be (49:14 - 49:20)
like the eight gyms pick three starters (49:17 - 49:22)
more traditional (49:20 - 49:25)
but just like how sword and shield took (49:22 - 49:27)
the hey pokemon are now walking in the (49:25 - 49:29)
area from let's go (49:27 - 49:31)
i'm assuming that gen9 is going to take (49:29 - 49:33)
from this and be like (49:31 - 49:36)
battles are just seamless (49:33 - 49:38)
i i think they i think they do stack and (49:36 - 49:42)
and that was i remember (49:38 - 49:44)
there there was a minority that was like (49:42 - 49:47)
oh i i like random battles i like (49:44 - 49:49)
not knowing what i'm running into (49:47 - 49:51)
they're definitely a minority (49:49 - 49:54)
at this point they are like old school (49:51 - 49:56)
love the jrpgs (49:54 - 49:58)
want that grind and there are games that (49:56 - 50:00)
exist that are grindy like bravely (49:58 - 50:01)
default (50:00 - 50:03)
those games are very that game is very (50:01 - 50:04)
grindy (50:03 - 50:06)
but (50:04 - 50:06)
the overwhelming amount of people loved (50:06 - 50:13)
that pokemon just walked in the area (50:09 - 50:14)
and (50:13 - 50:16)
when sword and shield refused to show (50:14 - 50:18)
that up front that was frustrating and (50:16 - 50:20)
then they were like we got yeah they are (50:18 - 50:22)
walking and that was great and i feel (50:20 - 50:24)
like this is going to be the same way (50:22 - 50:26)
people are going to see this like it and (50:24 - 50:28)
it's not that monster hunter thing we (50:26 - 50:30)
were talking about it it is like it is a (50:28 - 50:32)
normal pokemon battle (50:30 - 50:34)
the only difference is there's no black (50:32 - 50:36)
screen or weird like (50:34 - 50:38)
animation it's just you walk into the (50:36 - 50:40)
battle and it starts yeah there's no (50:38 - 50:42)
transition into the battle yeah it is (50:40 - 50:44)
that traditional i'm picking a move (50:42 - 50:46)
you're picking a move i'm picking a move (50:44 - 50:48)
and then when the health bar is done (50:46 - 50:50)
you're just literally walking away from (50:48 - 50:51)
it (50:50 - 50:54)
yeah um so i i would assume that that (50:51 - 50:56)
moves forward into a gen 9 or a gen 10 (50:54 - 50:58)
or whatever and i think just like with (50:56 - 50:59)
the let's go (50:58 - 51:01)
that would be disappointing if they went (50:59 - 51:03)
back on i can't imagine (51:01 - 51:06)
i feel like i could see (51:03 - 51:08)
i could see the next game not having (51:06 - 51:10)
that because of like the parallel (51:08 - 51:12)
developments like maybe (51:10 - 51:13)
they have something else in development (51:12 - 51:15)
that's more (51:13 - 51:17)
traditional i don't know you know i just (51:15 - 51:18)
like if the next game doesn't have it (51:17 - 51:20)
doesn't mean it's not coming back (51:18 - 51:24)
but like for example the the pokemon in (51:20 - 51:26)
the overworld i don't think we're ever (51:24 - 51:27)
not going to have that again except in (51:26 - 51:29)
another remake because we've had now (51:27 - 51:31)
this is the third game in a row (51:29 - 51:33)
excluding brilliant diamond shining (51:31 - 51:35)
power which clearly they wanted to be (51:33 - 51:37)
more like the original games (51:35 - 51:40)
oh they're heading let's go (51:37 - 51:41)
i get we have okay that's fair so fourth (51:40 - 51:43)
game in a row where there's been pokemon (51:41 - 51:44)
in the overworld um (51:43 - 51:46)
i don't think that's ever going away i (51:44 - 51:47)
don't think they're ever going to do (51:46 - 51:49)
that and i think i can see i think it's (51:47 - 51:50)
interesting when in sword and shield (51:49 - 51:53)
they had the kind of (51:50 - 51:55)
i want to say kind of compromise where (51:53 - 51:57)
they had the random encounters pop up on (51:55 - 51:59)
the grass and you could run into them if (51:57 - 52:00)
you wanted and i thought that was great (51:59 - 52:02)
i thought that was a great compromise i (52:00 - 52:03)
loved it because i could just run away (52:02 - 52:05)
from them uh (52:03 - 52:07)
the um (52:05 - 52:09)
i just the amount of time i've played (52:07 - 52:10)
bringing down shining peril over the (52:09 - 52:12)
last two months (52:10 - 52:16)
about 150 hours absolutely do not miss (52:12 - 52:18)
random encounters hate them no with a (52:16 - 52:19)
passion (52:18 - 52:21)
they're they're they're not fun (52:19 - 52:23)
there's there's it's just (52:21 - 52:25)
even when i was playing auras when you (52:23 - 52:27)
had to like get to groudon and it's like (52:25 - 52:29)
i i literally just have to get to (52:27 - 52:31)
groudon to complete this story beat and (52:29 - 52:35)
i i either opt for repels (52:31 - 52:35)
or give me that option (52:36 - 52:40)
or i just run i just accept that i'm (52:38 - 52:42)
going to see a minimum of eight zubats (52:40 - 52:44)
before i get to groudon and i will run (52:42 - 52:46)
from all of them but but the problem (52:44 - 52:48)
with repels is yeah they're they're good (52:46 - 52:50)
and i'm glad they exist but the problem (52:48 - 52:52)
is the way they work in (52:50 - 52:54)
most games (52:52 - 52:55)
is that it's (52:54 - 52:58)
basically all pokemon or no pokemon now (52:55 - 52:59)
granted you could try and figure out (52:58 - 53:01)
what level pokemon going to be in the (52:59 - 53:03)
wild and have your front pokemon as a (53:01 - 53:06)
specific level so you get some of them (53:03 - 53:07)
but actually what i like about i think (53:06 - 53:08)
let's go did this as well as certain (53:07 - 53:10)
shield but instead of like you see (53:08 - 53:13)
nothing it just reduces the number (53:10 - 53:15)
was that did let's go have that no let's (53:13 - 53:17)
go didn't have repels they had incense (53:15 - 53:20)
so it increased what you saw (53:17 - 53:22)
was there not a decrease one as well i (53:20 - 53:24)
don't think so i think there was no (53:22 - 53:26)
repels in let's go (53:24 - 53:28)
there was repels and sword and shield (53:26 - 53:31)
but it would not repel (53:28 - 53:33)
the pokemon you saw but it would repel (53:31 - 53:36)
anything that would be in the grass (53:33 - 53:37)
i think it just reduced the number you (53:36 - 53:40)
saw wasn't it the uncertainty of that (53:37 - 53:42)
yeah i think that's a nice because then (53:40 - 53:43)
it's like i don't want to be like (53:42 - 53:45)
covered in pokemon but i might want to (53:43 - 53:47)
see some if i feel like running into one (53:45 - 53:48)
than that i don't even i don't know if (53:47 - 53:51)
repel or incense are even in (53:48 - 53:53)
legends i i don't know (53:51 - 53:57)
well it's so easy to just run away (53:53 - 53:57)
um (54:00 - 54:05)
let's take a break (54:02 - 54:06)
i figured this would happen i figured (54:05 - 54:07)
our (54:06 - 54:08)
conversations would revolve around the (54:07 - 54:11)
pokedex that's why i wasn't like hey we (54:08 - 54:12)
we don't even have to talk about story (54:11 - 54:14)
because we got plenty plenty to talk (54:12 - 54:16)
about here uh so let's take a break when (54:14 - 54:18)
we come back we're gonna talk about some (54:16 - 54:21)
uh mechanics again no story and then uh (54:18 - 54:23)
we're we haven't talked about a couple (54:21 - 54:25)
of these pokemon so we will still talk i (54:23 - 54:27)
want to talk about gudra still so we (54:25 - 54:30)
will be uh right back (54:27 - 54:30)
uh oh i got the rope rope rope rope prep (54:30 - 54:35)
row rule (54:33 - 54:37)
hold on chat (54:35 - 54:40)
row app barry got there (54:37 - 54:42)
and we are back (54:40 - 54:44)
um (54:42 - 54:44)
i don't know if there's much to say (54:45 - 54:49)
about like electrode or growlithe (54:46 - 54:51)
they're like they're or not um arcanine (54:49 - 54:54)
they're like interesting their (54:51 - 54:56)
types don't change like they both their (54:54 - 54:57)
lines (54:56 - 54:58)
well the one thing i would say about (54:57 - 55:00)
electrode is a lot of people were like (54:58 - 55:02)
there's not gonna be an evolution for (55:00 - 55:05)
voltorb why would it evolve there's no (55:02 - 55:07)
power plants blah blah blah (55:05 - 55:09)
well (55:07 - 55:09)
well i think the thing about the lore (55:10 - 55:14)
behind electrode and voltorb is like (55:12 - 55:16)
there's a spirit inside of them (55:14 - 55:18)
and that's why they're wooden because (55:16 - 55:21)
like so a lot of the lore slash (55:18 - 55:23)
theme of this game is based on like (55:21 - 55:25)
yokai oh okay (55:23 - 55:27)
watch but like (55:25 - 55:28)
traditionally whatever (55:27 - 55:32)
yeah yes spirits inhabit the earth so a (55:28 - 55:33)
spirit being inside that's why there's (55:32 - 55:35)
like a hole on the top of (55:33 - 55:38)
both yeah i mean we were kind of hoping (55:35 - 55:39)
because because it's supposed to be full (55:38 - 55:41)
of seeds that like the seeds would (55:39 - 55:44)
sprout into something in more of like an (55:41 - 55:47)
exeggutor kind of manner yeah (55:44 - 55:49)
i i i think (55:47 - 55:50)
uh (55:49 - 55:52)
hissuian electrode is fine i just (55:50 - 55:53)
thought that that was their chance to (55:52 - 55:55)
take like a risk (55:53 - 55:56)
um (55:55 - 55:58)
speaking of risks uh sneeziller is (55:56 - 56:01)
probably the weirdest yes (55:58 - 56:03)
pokemon (56:01 - 56:07)
on the list right like you like overkill (56:03 - 56:09)
ursa ursuluna (56:07 - 56:11)
cleaver they're all like yeah that makes (56:09 - 56:13)
sense (56:11 - 56:14)
so i (56:13 - 56:16)
i thought it was weird and then i saw it (56:14 - 56:18)
climbing (56:16 - 56:20)
and then amazing (56:18 - 56:22)
yes yes but weird in a good way (56:20 - 56:24)
weird enough this is amazing i love (56:22 - 56:26)
being in this weird (56:24 - 56:28)
long (56:26 - 56:32)
creatures basket it's my cat (56:28 - 56:33)
is (56:32 - 56:34)
that (56:33 - 56:37)
it it's very obvious the (56:34 - 56:39)
the initial marketing was like hey y'all (56:37 - 56:42)
like breath of the wild (56:39 - 56:45)
let's kind of copy that and that's fine (56:42 - 56:47)
i get it it's like a very easy sell (56:45 - 56:48)
especially to somebody who's maybe (56:47 - 56:50)
hasn't played pokemon in like 10 years (56:48 - 56:52)
they see it's similar to breath of wild (56:50 - 56:53)
everyone loves breath of wild no one (56:52 - 56:55)
hates breath of the wild if you hate (56:53 - 56:57)
breath of the wild you're just like some (56:55 - 56:59)
weird hipster that's like blah (56:57 - 57:02)
like breath a while very good game (56:59 - 57:05)
and i feel like after watching people (57:02 - 57:06)
play and seeing these leaks i was like (57:05 - 57:08)
hey we're like (57:06 - 57:09)
getting away from breath of the wild (57:08 - 57:12)
this feels like a pokemon game that is (57:09 - 57:13)
just (57:12 - 57:16)
another step forward (57:13 - 57:18)
and then they show sneezler climbing a (57:16 - 57:20)
mountain and you're like we're back to (57:18 - 57:21)
breath of the wild we're climbing (57:20 - 57:23)
mountains now again because that's what (57:21 - 57:24)
you do in bristol wild you climb a (57:23 - 57:25)
mountain (57:24 - 57:27)
right okay i mean i think it's not the (57:25 - 57:28)
only game in the world that you can (57:27 - 57:30)
climb a mountain right sure (57:28 - 57:32)
i think i think it is absolutely true to (57:30 - 57:35)
say that this is doing for pokemon (57:32 - 57:36)
a lot of the things that breath of the (57:35 - 57:39)
wild did for zelda (57:36 - 57:40)
and it doesn't make it exactly the same (57:39 - 57:42)
game it does mean it's probably (57:40 - 57:44)
influenced in some ways it is not over (57:42 - 57:45)
in the world right let's not have that (57:44 - 57:47)
argument again i didn't don't really (57:45 - 57:50)
care z crystals are literally summons (57:47 - 57:51)
from final fantasy it just took them (57:50 - 57:53)
that long to like figure it out like (57:51 - 57:55)
yeah yeah (57:53 - 57:58)
i think it's doing a lot of good things (57:55 - 58:00)
in the same way that the breath of the (57:58 - 58:02)
wild did and i think that's really good (58:00 - 58:03)
um (58:02 - 58:04)
this is by no means going to be a (58:03 - 58:05)
perfect game and i'm sure i'm going to (58:04 - 58:07)
hate some aspects of it but sneezler (58:05 - 58:09)
climbing (58:07 - 58:11)
i mean i was i was kind of like how is (58:09 - 58:13)
this you know (58:11 - 58:15)
mountain you know going what's it called (58:13 - 58:17)
i can't believe we've forgotten the name (58:15 - 58:19)
cornet yeah (58:17 - 58:21)
like is it going to be like how are you (58:19 - 58:22)
going to get up this mountain is it (58:21 - 58:24)
gonna be a bit weird like kind of the it (58:22 - 58:26)
would feel a bit weird to go into like (58:24 - 58:27)
you've got your cave and then you come (58:26 - 58:28)
out of a cave like you did in a (58:27 - 58:29)
traditional pokemon game right that (58:28 - 58:31)
wouldn't really feel like it fits and (58:29 - 58:32)
then you've got sneezler just climbing (58:31 - 58:36)
up the side of it it's just amazing (58:32 - 58:38)
it's a (58:36 - 58:38)
you there are people out there that like (58:39 - 58:43)
hate humanoid pokemon (58:41 - 58:46)
they've made the most humanoid pokemon (58:43 - 58:48)
they could no like (58:46 - 58:51)
what humans have you seen (58:48 - 58:53)
like what uh what other pokemon looks (58:51 - 58:56)
more like i would say incineroar maybe (58:53 - 58:57)
you know it's wearing a belt you know (58:56 - 59:00)
it's like a wrestler but man now like (58:57 - 59:02)
takes steeler is (59:00 - 59:05)
uh uh weevile (59:02 - 59:07)
and gigantomax meowth (59:05 - 59:10)
got together and had a baby (59:07 - 59:14)
and you got long cat sneezler (59:10 - 59:14)
i uh (59:15 - 59:18)
hated the slagoo gudra when you see them (59:18 - 59:23)
in the static shock (59:21 - 59:26)
shots they look awful (59:23 - 59:27)
yeah (59:26 - 59:29)
and i had to link another picture here (59:27 - 59:31)
it's the idol animation (59:29 - 59:32)
um (59:31 - 59:35)
and i didn't realize because the the (59:32 - 59:38)
still image doesn't do justice the thing (59:35 - 59:41)
on their back is a shell it's not like a (59:38 - 59:42)
rolled up tail (59:41 - 59:44)
so when goodra like (59:42 - 59:48)
slurps back into the shell oh that word (59:44 - 59:50)
uh retracts (59:48 - 59:53)
it when it contracts (59:50 - 59:54)
it it's (59:53 - 59:57)
it it instantly becomes cooler (59:54 - 59:59)
and then you kind of look at normal (59:57 - 60:01)
goudrea was gudra gen 6 (59:59 - 60:03)
yes and you're like (60:01 - 60:05)
oh (60:03 - 60:07)
that's not as far stretch like that like (60:05 - 60:09)
it it seems (60:07 - 60:12)
like oh an older goodra would be like (60:09 - 60:15)
this shellfish creature it's very cool (60:12 - 60:16)
it's like really cool i like it a lot (60:15 - 60:18)
well i mean it's like snails and slugs (60:16 - 60:20)
and i think a lot of people forget that (60:18 - 60:23)
goodra is supposed to be slimy (60:20 - 60:25)
they're like oh it's so cute (60:23 - 60:26)
there's parts of the internet that have (60:25 - 60:28)
not forgot that goudre is supposed to be (60:26 - 60:30)
you don't need to know about that thanks (60:28 - 60:32)
why did why (60:30 - 60:34)
we don't talk about those areas of the (60:32 - 60:36)
internet sometimes (60:34 - 60:40)
i was just talking about myspace um (60:36 - 60:40)
the i think the good or the sligoo (60:40 - 60:45)
really great uh a sneasler as weird as (60:42 - 60:49)
it is very cool um (60:45 - 60:49)
avalog seems like the only kind of (60:50 - 60:54)
forgettable one here like it's cool that (60:52 - 60:56)
it they did something with avalor but (60:54 - 60:58)
it's just like yeah it's fine and like i (60:56 - 60:59)
get what it just looks like (60:58 - 61:01)
it looks like a better shiny basically (60:59 - 61:03)
it doesn't have any kind of structural (61:01 - 61:04)
changes it's just slightly different (61:03 - 61:06)
colors and i get what obviously the (61:04 - 61:07)
colors aren't just colors they're (61:06 - 61:08)
obviously not meant to be ice they're (61:07 - 61:11)
meant to be rock but if you just look at (61:08 - 61:13)
it it just looks like a shiny (61:11 - 61:15)
yeah we'll have to see how it operates (61:13 - 61:16)
like on the map (61:15 - 61:18)
i think that's going to be very telling (61:16 - 61:19)
yeah (61:18 - 61:23)
um the lilligant is great uh there was (61:19 - 61:25)
uh i saw a (61:23 - 61:27)
the twitch streamer i was watching (61:25 - 61:30)
um by the way just (61:27 - 61:32)
the the the streamers i was watching and (61:30 - 61:35)
i and this is just because i was in (61:32 - 61:37)
their chat i didn't say anything but (61:35 - 61:41)
um all of their gameplay was super laggy (61:37 - 61:44)
and when they were fighting liligant it (61:41 - 61:46)
like it was it was like two frames a (61:44 - 61:49)
second choppy and (61:46 - 61:53)
the yeah and this was uh i wanted i want (61:49 - 61:54)
to disclose that this was a problem with (61:53 - 61:56)
sword and shield (61:54 - 61:58)
where there was this there was this (61:56 - 61:59)
narrative around sword and shield that (61:58 - 62:00)
it was going to be the worst selling (61:59 - 62:02)
game ever everyone boycott it look how (62:00 - 62:04)
bad it is look at that this there's not (62:02 - 62:07)
even music in the scene look at how like (62:04 - 62:09)
these creatures lag out (62:07 - 62:10)
but what these all these people that (62:09 - 62:12)
were pushing this narrative didn't say (62:10 - 62:14)
is they they were using (62:12 - 62:17)
hacked switches slash rom version they (62:14 - 62:18)
didn't actually have a copy of the game (62:17 - 62:20)
so what happens is somebody gets a copy (62:18 - 62:22)
they dump it on the internet and then (62:20 - 62:24)
people find it on the internet and then (62:22 - 62:25)
download it (62:24 - 62:28)
and those copies don't always run very (62:25 - 62:30)
smoothly (62:28 - 62:31)
yeah so most most people that have it (62:30 - 62:32)
just now they're not actually playing on (62:31 - 62:34)
switches um because actually switches (62:32 - 62:36)
are quite difficult to hack unless you (62:34 - 62:38)
have an original switch like original (62:36 - 62:39)
original (62:38 - 62:41)
um you can't actually hack it and and (62:39 - 62:45)
even then they're not great to hack uh (62:41 - 62:47)
not that i've tried (62:45 - 62:49)
um not that i had an original switch and (62:47 - 62:51)
sold it to somebody that was very (62:49 - 62:52)
interested in it and i was like i'm (62:51 - 62:54)
interested in the price you were (62:52 - 62:55)
offering me (62:54 - 62:57)
don't know what you're talking about um (62:55 - 62:58)
the (62:57 - 63:00)
so most people are actually playing them (62:58 - 63:03)
on emulators um (63:00 - 63:03)
yeah the people i've seen a couple of (63:07 - 63:10)
people who've done both emulator and (63:09 - 63:12)
switch and have said that when they play (63:10 - 63:15)
on switch it is miles better like it is (63:12 - 63:17)
night and day better (63:15 - 63:18)
yeah i mean obviously there are people (63:17 - 63:21)
out there with actual copies if you have (63:18 - 63:22)
money (63:21 - 63:25)
and you know at least a couple people it (63:22 - 63:27)
is very possible to find a mom and pop (63:25 - 63:29)
shop that do not care about street and (63:27 - 63:32)
hey don't blame it on the mon paw shots (63:29 - 63:33)
it could be (63:32 - 63:34)
something i would look i worked at a (63:33 - 63:36)
game stop (63:34 - 63:37)
if if (63:36 - 63:39)
if i was one position higher than (63:37 - 63:40)
associate and i was like (63:39 - 63:42)
assistant manager it would be very easy (63:40 - 63:45)
to get anyone a copy of a game like when (63:42 - 63:48)
i worked at gamestop we had halo 3 (63:45 - 63:50)
almost two months early sitting in the (63:48 - 63:52)
back boxes of them (63:50 - 63:54)
like if i was the closing general (63:52 - 63:56)
manager of the store nothing would stop (63:54 - 63:58)
me from opening a box taking out a cut (63:56 - 64:00)
like no one would know like it like it's (63:58 - 64:02)
very easy to get games early (64:00 - 64:04)
um (64:02 - 64:07)
but uh the reason i i brought that up is (64:04 - 64:09)
because i just don't want that same (64:07 - 64:10)
narrative to be pushed of like look at (64:09 - 64:12)
how bad and laggy this game is i don't (64:10 - 64:14)
know it's possible that like the actual (64:12 - 64:16)
physical copies might lag out or might (64:14 - 64:17)
not be super smooth i mean look at (64:16 - 64:20)
ultrasound ultramoon that game was (64:17 - 64:22)
very laggy yeah (64:20 - 64:24)
uh (64:22 - 64:25)
but it was funny because people in chat (64:24 - 64:28)
were talking about like the emulation (64:25 - 64:30)
version or software i'm not 100 sure how (64:28 - 64:32)
that works but somebody in chat was like (64:30 - 64:34)
oh no one can get past the volcano part (64:32 - 64:36)
apparently there's a volcano in the game (64:34 - 64:38)
and every play every emulated person it (64:36 - 64:41)
would crash there instantly (64:38 - 64:43)
so i don't know the emulators (64:41 - 64:46)
their emulator aren't perfect i know (64:43 - 64:48)
there is at least one person who has (64:46 - 64:50)
completed the game uh like completed (64:48 - 64:52)
completed (64:50 - 64:54)
that would be my other question is how (64:52 - 64:55)
long is this game but (64:54 - 64:58)
i guess we'll find out (64:55 - 65:00)
do you want me to say anything no (64:58 - 65:02)
no i don't want to see anything (65:00 - 65:03)
not saying anything (65:02 - 65:05)
um (65:03 - 65:06)
legend (65:05 - 65:07)
uh (65:06 - 65:10)
legendary uh what is this pokemon's name (65:07 - 65:13)
an amorous is that like a play (65:10 - 65:14)
b (65:13 - 65:17)
enamel yeah love yeah (65:14 - 65:19)
uh obviously (65:17 - 65:21)
it literally has a therian form i think (65:19 - 65:24)
it says in-game therian form (65:21 - 65:25)
um (65:24 - 65:27)
you know what's funny is irene wanted to (65:25 - 65:30)
see these leaks and which is great (65:27 - 65:31)
because like there are there are very (65:30 - 65:33)
close friends of mine that do not want (65:31 - 65:35)
to know anything early (65:33 - 65:37)
i want to talk about pokemon i want to (65:35 - 65:39)
talk about it so irene's like let me see (65:37 - 65:40)
these new pokemon and she looked at the (65:39 - 65:43)
whole list and she was like this is my (65:40 - 65:45)
new favorite pokemon and she pointed to (65:43 - 65:47)
an amorous which is like (65:45 - 65:50)
oh interesting that you like like this (65:47 - 65:52)
so much (65:50 - 65:53)
um (65:52 - 65:56)
it's cool (65:53 - 65:56)
and (65:56 - 66:00)
i'm kind of disappointed with the (65:57 - 66:02)
the therian form of it (66:00 - 66:04)
because like turtle (66:02 - 66:07)
well with a snake (66:04 - 66:09)
yeah on its back (66:07 - 66:11)
um yeah it has like flippers (66:09 - 66:13)
yeah well that's turtles that can have (66:11 - 66:15)
flippers if they're like more of the (66:13 - 66:18)
aquatic type but um (66:15 - 66:21)
but like landorus tornadoes thundurus (66:18 - 66:24)
they like they just like they're one (66:21 - 66:25)
animal (66:24 - 66:27)
in their therian form (66:25 - 66:28)
and (66:27 - 66:30)
this enamoris is it's always like two (66:28 - 66:33)
things it's the snake and (66:30 - 66:35)
like the person shape the snake and the (66:33 - 66:38)
turtle i don't understand the the lore (66:35 - 66:41)
here like thunderous is (66:38 - 66:42)
thunder (66:41 - 66:45)
tornados is wind landorus is like (66:42 - 66:47)
bounty of the harvest (66:45 - 66:49)
what what is this love it's just love (66:47 - 66:51)
right (66:49 - 66:53)
you love to see (66:51 - 66:53)
um (66:54 - 66:57)
well i mean because venus came from the (66:55 - 66:59)
ocean so you can say that (66:57 - 67:02)
is where that is coming from (66:59 - 67:02)
it's it seems cool uh al i didn't see (67:03 - 67:08)
are there abilities in this game (67:05 - 67:11)
um i believe (67:08 - 67:13)
there is (67:11 - 67:16)
not really (67:13 - 67:18)
there is one pokemon that (67:16 - 67:20)
has an ability type thing (67:18 - 67:22)
um (67:20 - 67:24)
but that would give a little bit (67:22 - 67:26)
nothing else okay because because (67:24 - 67:27)
because i saw last night for the first (67:26 - 67:30)
time there are no held items in the game (67:27 - 67:32)
yeah so basically the answer is no (67:30 - 67:35)
um which is which is like (67:32 - 67:35)
they at least communicate up front (67:36 - 67:41)
with with let's go they were like hey (67:39 - 67:44)
look this is not a competitive game (67:41 - 67:45)
competitive will stay in ultrasound (67:44 - 67:48)
ultramoon okay cool now that we're all (67:45 - 67:50)
on the same page feel free to spend your (67:48 - 67:52)
60 dollars and when you play through (67:50 - 67:54)
let's go (67:52 - 67:56)
there is no abilities there are no held (67:54 - 67:57)
items (67:56 - 67:59)
there's also only like four ghost type (67:57 - 68:01)
pokemon in that entire game there's (67:59 - 68:03)
alola marowak and then the gagar line (68:01 - 68:05)
there's like five dragon type pokemon in (68:03 - 68:07)
the entire game there's like four (68:05 - 68:08)
fairies (68:07 - 68:09)
like (68:08 - 68:14)
can would adding held items and um (68:09 - 68:16)
abilities (68:14 - 68:18)
make that more interesting in a (68:16 - 68:19)
competitive sense (68:18 - 68:20)
no (68:19 - 68:23)
like not really (68:20 - 68:23)
uh with this small pokedex of 240 (68:24 - 68:30)
and not hearing there was any and which (68:28 - 68:31)
is funny too because people would be (68:30 - 68:33)
like well let's go is not a main series (68:31 - 68:34)
because there's no held items and (68:33 - 68:36)
there's no and it's like what what are (68:34 - 68:39)
your weird definitions of (68:36 - 68:39)
uh (68:39 - 68:42)
obviously they said legends is not (68:42 - 68:45)
competitive the only multiplayer they (68:43 - 68:48)
said is available is trading another (68:45 - 68:49)
human (68:48 - 68:52)
um (68:49 - 68:52)
having no held items is is fine like (68:52 - 68:57)
it's whatever like (68:55 - 68:59)
they they said what this game is no (68:57 - 69:01)
competitive your goal is to complete the (68:59 - 69:03)
first ever pokedex ever made (69:01 - 69:06)
enjoy (69:03 - 69:06)
yes correct (69:09 - 69:13)
it is a choice (69:11 - 69:15)
and it you it kind of it's it's kind of (69:13 - 69:16)
like (69:15 - 69:18)
i wonder if (69:16 - 69:22)
over the years i mean they must know (69:18 - 69:23)
like (69:22 - 69:25)
the majority of players don't even think (69:23 - 69:27)
about abilities don't maybe follow how (69:25 - 69:29)
they work (69:27 - 69:30)
like (69:29 - 69:31)
i watched irene play all through sword (69:30 - 69:33)
and shield (69:31 - 69:34)
all through ultrasound ultramoon all (69:33 - 69:36)
through sun and moon i don't think she (69:34 - 69:37)
ever put on a held item on a single (69:36 - 69:38)
pokemon (69:37 - 69:40)
you don't have to (69:38 - 69:41)
what (69:40 - 69:43)
like yeah you can put mystic water on (69:41 - 69:46)
your on your uh popplio but like (69:43 - 69:47)
yeah (69:46 - 69:50)
it's also it's not (69:47 - 69:51)
now i know it's been in the games for a (69:50 - 69:52)
long time (69:51 - 69:54)
but it's not kind of (69:52 - 69:56)
it was never originally core to the idea (69:54 - 69:59)
of the game right the idea of pokemon (69:56 - 70:00)
was (69:59 - 70:02)
a creature collection an exploration (70:00 - 70:03)
game (70:02 - 70:05)
and the battling (70:03 - 70:08)
almost kind of happened through that (70:05 - 70:10)
right and that like well what's we're (70:08 - 70:11)
going to need to put something in (70:10 - 70:13)
for you to you know grow (70:11 - 70:16)
i need to be able to catch these pokemon (70:13 - 70:18)
and so the idea of abilities and held (70:16 - 70:20)
items came later because they wanted to (70:18 - 70:22)
change how things went how it actually (70:20 - 70:23)
worked (70:22 - 70:24)
and (70:23 - 70:26)
and now they're changing a bit in a (70:24 - 70:28)
different way with the (70:26 - 70:30)
different styles of battle and the (70:28 - 70:33)
integration with the overworld (70:30 - 70:38)
yeah and i i i don't think that (70:33 - 70:41)
abilities and i i abilities and held (70:38 - 70:44)
items are important in a sense of like (70:41 - 70:46)
the hardcore post game (70:44 - 70:48)
i want to get into battling (70:46 - 70:50)
yeah but if you if you're just making a (70:48 - 70:52)
game to (70:50 - 70:54)
like hey like this game is completing a (70:52 - 70:57)
pokedex having a story (70:54 - 70:58)
doing whatever you're doing and i don't (70:57 - 70:59)
know what you're doing in post game (70:58 - 71:01)
besides like (70:59 - 71:02)
obviously every pokemon game you could (71:01 - 71:03)
say shiny hunting (71:02 - 71:05)
every pokemon game you could say (71:03 - 71:06)
completing the pokedex i don't know what (71:05 - 71:07)
else you're doing at the end of this (71:06 - 71:08)
game (71:07 - 71:10)
but (71:08 - 71:14)
competitive battling is not one (71:10 - 71:17)
so why focus on these things that (71:14 - 71:19)
they can use that time for (71:17 - 71:21)
their next game (71:19 - 71:24)
yeah no exactly (71:21 - 71:24)
or do you know if they are developing (71:24 - 71:28)
that separate battle (71:26 - 71:30)
thing for people who want to battle and (71:28 - 71:33)
that's where the held items are (71:30 - 71:34)
you're getting people's words when it (71:33 - 71:35)
comes out (71:34 - 71:37)
we all agree too much on that do we need (71:35 - 71:38)
an alternative no i think they should (71:37 - 71:40)
have held items and abilities and i will (71:38 - 71:42)
not buy a game until it has it that's a (71:40 - 71:43)
lie (71:42 - 71:46)
yeah i i (71:43 - 71:49)
but even if you were into competitive (71:46 - 71:51)
this game is not competitive (71:49 - 71:52)
so like that wouldn't be like a reason (71:51 - 71:55)
be like (71:52 - 71:56)
like look and (71:55 - 71:58)
i'm sorry (71:56 - 71:59)
competitive people let me throw you (71:58 - 72:00)
under the bus real quick (71:59 - 72:02)
all they're all these competitive people (72:00 - 72:05)
and i'm very i know a lot of them (72:02 - 72:08)
they were all like sword and shield is (72:05 - 72:11)
boring let's make diamond and pearl (72:08 - 72:12)
let's let's make these all these (72:11 - 72:14)
grassroot tournaments for diamond and (72:12 - 72:17)
pearl diamond and pearl meta so fun (72:14 - 72:18)
and (72:17 - 72:21)
one of my friends joe ux9 very talented (72:18 - 72:24)
player a he's won so many tournaments (72:21 - 72:26)
he posted on twitter he was like what's (72:24 - 72:27)
stopping you from getting into (72:26 - 72:29)
competitive diamond and pearl (72:27 - 72:31)
and i i responded i was like (72:29 - 72:33)
how am i supposed to get perfect ivs in (72:31 - 72:38)
this game how am i supposed to get (72:33 - 72:38)
a team ready that isn't just (72:39 - 72:45)
grinding battle tower just to buy bottle (72:42 - 72:47)
caps and then grinding the underground (72:45 - 72:49)
just to get those pokemon to level 100 (72:47 - 72:51)
to then give them the bottle caps like (72:49 - 72:52)
you want me to get ready for a (72:51 - 72:54)
tournament this weekend i am literally (72:52 - 72:57)
spending a week grinding a team to then (72:54 - 72:59)
probably be like (72:57 - 73:00)
i need a different team next week and i (72:59 - 73:02)
got to do this all over again (73:00 - 73:04)
and as soon as series 12 was announced (73:02 - 73:06)
for sword and shield (73:04 - 73:07)
no one cares about diamond pearl anymore (73:06 - 73:08)
because they're back to sword and shield (73:07 - 73:10)
because it's a better com like it's an (73:08 - 73:12)
actually better it's so weird to me (73:10 - 73:14)
because they said up front hey diamond (73:12 - 73:16)
and pearl is not competitive why would (73:14 - 73:18)
you ever have been distracted from sword (73:16 - 73:20)
and shields (73:18 - 73:22)
yeah but they could have easily like if (73:20 - 73:24)
they if they just made things easier to (73:22 - 73:26)
obtain and diamond pearl i could totally (73:24 - 73:28)
see but they said up front we're not (73:26 - 73:30)
gonna do that (73:28 - 73:32)
i do find it fascinating how they added (73:30 - 73:35)
in like with radar you can get (73:32 - 73:37)
five guaranteed five ivs for a chain of (73:35 - 73:39)
a hundred and then made it practically (73:37 - 73:41)
impossible to get to that (73:39 - 73:44)
yeah like no competitive person there's (73:41 - 73:46)
a reason why like competitive people (73:44 - 73:49)
they use like bots or they use like (73:46 - 73:51)
what pka hex or whatever because it it (73:49 - 73:54)
takes seconds to just generate a pokemon (73:51 - 73:56)
to then get ready for battle like no (73:54 - 73:58)
competitive person wants to spend a full (73:56 - 74:00)
week building a team for one single (73:58 - 74:04)
tournament it's just like yeah (74:00 - 74:06)
a person get like there is fun to (74:04 - 74:08)
building a team (74:06 - 74:10)
there is fun to like collecting the (74:08 - 74:13)
items and having the resources and like (74:10 - 74:14)
even in sword and shield like i could (74:13 - 74:16)
build a team in in maybe two hours but i (74:14 - 74:18)
have all the resources i have all the (74:16 - 74:20)
candy i have all the bottle caps i (74:18 - 74:21)
i (74:20 - 74:24)
might have to trade one or two pokemon (74:21 - 74:27)
for egg moves but realistically in sword (74:24 - 74:28)
shield you can build a whole team in (74:27 - 74:30)
like two hours if if you've just played (74:28 - 74:32)
that video game for a bit (74:30 - 74:35)
in diamond and pearl (74:32 - 74:35)
i got i i'm dedicating my life (74:35 - 74:39)
so (74:37 - 74:41)
to get back to what's important we've (74:39 - 74:43)
now established no abilities no held (74:41 - 74:46)
items in legends arceus are there ivs (74:43 - 74:48)
and evs do we know (74:46 - 74:51)
yes yes okay i think the alpha pokemon (74:48 - 74:53)
have like guaranteed ivs (74:51 - 74:54)
they have they have (74:53 - 74:57)
automatic like they have ivs evs are (74:54 - 75:01)
already on them evs on them not ivs (74:57 - 75:02)
but they're aren't they guaranteed like (75:01 - 75:05)
three ivs i i don't think so i think (75:02 - 75:07)
that was a misunderstanding i think that (75:05 - 75:09)
was somebody's theory (75:07 - 75:10)
but it actually turns out they come with (75:09 - 75:13)
evs already on them um (75:10 - 75:14)
the other thing that's interesting we (75:13 - 75:17)
were talking about uh sword and shield (75:14 - 75:18)
returning (75:17 - 75:20)
is level uh (75:18 - 75:22)
xp candy coming back yeah i saw that was (75:20 - 75:25)
coming back that ins again another thing (75:22 - 75:26)
that like (75:25 - 75:28)
i'm back into this game (75:26 - 75:30)
just like so many little things that (75:28 - 75:32)
they need a checklist for every pokemon (75:30 - 75:35)
game right abilities yes or no uh held (75:32 - 75:37)
items yes or no xp candy yes or no they (75:35 - 75:39)
just need this list for the for the (75:37 - 75:41)
hardcore fans like how annoyed am i (75:39 - 75:43)
going to be at this game (75:41 - 75:46)
we've gotten to that point i agree (75:43 - 75:51)
there is um a sec this is this is this (75:46 - 75:52)
is something that they're gonna take (75:51 - 75:55)
away from us and i'm gonna be so mad (75:52 - 75:57)
in this game there is one single item (75:55 - 76:01)
that handles trade evolution pokemon (75:57 - 76:03)
which is something that i will look at (76:01 - 76:05)
let's i will look at pokemon go and be (76:03 - 76:08)
like the sino-stone perfect one stone (76:05 - 76:09)
handles everything like that's not even (76:08 - 76:11)
one they're like cinnastone unova (76:09 - 76:12)
stunned perfect great that's that's a (76:11 - 76:14)
whole lot of pokemon under one single (76:12 - 76:15)
stone (76:14 - 76:17)
um what is this is called the linking (76:15 - 76:20)
chord (76:17 - 76:20)
you use it on they use it on a kadabra (76:21 - 76:25)
here (76:24 - 76:28)
it is one of the coolest evolution (76:25 - 76:29)
screens (76:28 - 76:30)
in (76:29 - 76:32)
in all of pokemon games uh how how a (76:30 - 76:36)
pokemon evolves here and it evolves the (76:32 - 76:40)
kadabra into an alakazam (76:36 - 76:40)
and this is the like this is something (76:40 - 76:45)
they need to put in all future games (76:43 - 76:47)
right like this is an incredible quality (76:45 - 76:49)
of life feature (76:47 - 76:50)
it's interesting that some of the things (76:49 - 76:52)
that they've kind of over time kind of (76:50 - 76:54)
improved like with uh (76:52 - 76:57)
uh i was going to say i see on glaceon (76:54 - 76:59)
and leafeon the the adding the ability (76:57 - 77:01)
for the stones to evolve them rather (76:59 - 77:03)
than having to go find this and i think (77:01 - 77:04)
they did that with magnzone as well you (77:03 - 77:06)
can (77:04 - 77:06)
yes that's what a thunderstone yeah um (77:07 - 77:11)
you know these sorts of things but yeah (77:10 - 77:13)
like until this point they'd never (77:11 - 77:15)
improved trade evolutions (77:13 - 77:18)
and i mean (77:15 - 77:19)
they can argue i mean it's always been (77:18 - 77:21)
an argument that it's about being able (77:19 - 77:22)
to (77:21 - 77:24)
make you (77:22 - 77:25)
communicate with other people and play (77:24 - 77:29)
the game with other people but (77:25 - 77:29)
in my experience most people either (77:30 - 77:33)
don't care or buy two games (77:31 - 77:35)
you know right well (77:33 - 77:36)
i think (77:35 - 77:38)
what we may find is that they keep the (77:36 - 77:40)
trade evolutions when there's two (77:38 - 77:42)
versions of a game but if there's only (77:40 - 77:45)
one version then yeah they give you the (77:42 - 77:46)
item for it (77:45 - 77:49)
i mean they should still have this item (77:46 - 77:52)
just make it harder to get (77:49 - 77:53)
right like hey no because then people (77:52 - 77:55)
like you are going to complain it's too (77:53 - 77:56)
hard to get (77:55 - 77:58)
give me my experience (77:56 - 77:59)
i think having options is still good (77:58 - 78:02)
right like as much as i think experience (77:59 - 78:04)
share should always be on and for the (78:02 - 78:06)
record it is on in this game there's no (78:04 - 78:08)
turning it off (78:06 - 78:11)
like experience share being on (78:08 - 78:12)
which when did they start that that was (78:11 - 78:15)
let's go pikachu let's go evie i think (78:12 - 78:18)
i think so yes and then sword and shield (78:15 - 78:19)
because again people complain super (78:18 - 78:21)
sword and shield i think in sun and moon (78:19 - 78:23)
you could toggle it (78:21 - 78:25)
uh or ultra sun and moon (78:23 - 78:26)
but (78:25 - 78:29)
experience share always being on is a (78:26 - 78:31)
legit thing that should always be on (78:29 - 78:33)
like like look at every other jrpg out (78:31 - 78:36)
there like it's just on because your (78:33 - 78:39)
party should get experience (78:36 - 78:41)
um and (78:39 - 78:43)
but do i think there should be a toggle (78:41 - 78:44)
yeah sure because there's like four (78:43 - 78:46)
weird people out there that like would (78:44 - 78:48)
rather toggle that button instead of (78:46 - 78:50)
just dumping (78:48 - 78:52)
like the three pokemon that they don't (78:50 - 78:54)
want to get experienced like i i i legit (78:52 - 78:56)
evie train all the time (78:54 - 78:58)
um i just built a team for series 12 (78:56 - 79:01)
which isn't even available yet and it (78:58 - 79:03)
was really easy to be like okay these (79:01 - 79:05)
two pokemon need max evs and speed i'm (79:03 - 79:07)
just gonna dump the four pokemon that i (79:05 - 79:10)
don't want to have max evs in my pc that (79:07 - 79:13)
i can access anywhere and it took four (79:10 - 79:15)
seconds to do that like it's very easy (79:13 - 79:17)
not to put evs on pokemon you don't want (79:15 - 79:19)
to get ievs (79:17 - 79:19)
but (79:22 - 79:25)
just like in pokemon go (79:23 - 79:27)
you could either spend the 100 candy to (79:25 - 79:30)
evolve the machamp yourself (79:27 - 79:30)
or (79:30 - 79:32)
you can trade a choke for a machoke and (79:30 - 79:34)
then you have free evolution like this (79:32 - 79:36)
this should be an item near the end of (79:34 - 79:37)
the game that was like yeah that's what (79:36 - 79:39)
i was going to suggest actually you make (79:37 - 79:42)
it you don't make it miles harder like i (79:39 - 79:44)
don't like the ones that are in in go (79:42 - 79:47)
which are 200 candy or or trade them (79:44 - 79:48)
those annoy me (79:47 - 79:49)
um (79:48 - 79:51)
but yeah just like having (79:49 - 79:52)
two different ways that aren't (79:51 - 79:54)
necessarily the easiest way to do it (79:52 - 79:57)
fine whatever (79:54 - 79:57)
even if i have to do battle points (79:58 - 80:01)
fine (80:00 - 80:03)
make me do the battle points (80:01 - 80:06)
i don't want to talk about exactly the (80:03 - 80:09)
240 pokemon in this dex because i think (80:06 - 80:12)
there's still some discovery there (80:09 - 80:13)
but (80:12 - 80:15)
al you can confirm there's not a single (80:13 - 80:17)
gen 8 pokemon in this decks (80:15 - 80:18)
depends whether you count the new ones (80:17 - 80:20)
as gen 8 pokemon (80:18 - 80:23)
oh sure but like crime rants (80:20 - 80:24)
yeah there's not nothing (80:23 - 80:26)
none of the new pokemon insert and (80:24 - 80:28)
shield are in this game yeah which (80:26 - 80:29)
sorry to circle back to that (80:28 - 80:32)
conversation we had earlier (80:29 - 80:35)
but people are still holding on to like (80:32 - 80:38)
sword and shield getting all 890 pokemon (80:35 - 80:40)
maybe yeah (80:38 - 80:42)
but but we've had let's go pikachu let's (80:40 - 80:44)
go eevee 153 pokemon sword and shield (80:42 - 80:46)
600 pokemon brilliant diamond shining (80:44 - 80:49)
pearl 500 pokemon this is the fourth (80:46 - 80:51)
game 240 pokemon (80:49 - 80:54)
they said (80:51 - 80:56)
that there will no longer be a pokemon (80:54 - 80:58)
game with all the pokemon (80:56 - 80:59)
and the (80:58 - 81:00)
did they actually say i don't think they (80:59 - 81:02)
said i don't think they said it's never (81:00 - 81:03)
going to happen again i think they said (81:02 - 81:04)
that more and more they're going to be (81:03 - 81:06)
more selective but that doesn't mean it (81:04 - 81:08)
will never happen yeah i don't think (81:06 - 81:11)
never was ever uttered as a word (81:08 - 81:13)
but i mean your point still stands like (81:11 - 81:15)
yeah i think the the idea that (81:13 - 81:17)
i if they were going to update sword and (81:15 - 81:18)
shield with the rest remaining pokemon (81:17 - 81:20)
they would have done it by now there was (81:18 - 81:22)
a there was a a huge gap between crown (81:20 - 81:24)
tundra and brilliant diamond shining (81:22 - 81:25)
peril why would they not have taken that (81:24 - 81:28)
time to do it (81:25 - 81:29)
um also (81:28 - 81:31)
also say like probably the reason that (81:29 - 81:32)
there are no (81:31 - 81:35)
sword and shield pokemon is because of (81:32 - 81:37)
the development cycle and if they were (81:35 - 81:39)
working on this before sword and shield (81:37 - 81:41)
were finished they couldn't say for sure (81:39 - 81:44)
which pokemon would be retained (81:41 - 81:45)
so they didn't want to take that it's (81:44 - 81:46)
just like (81:45 - 81:50)
it is it is a bold choice not to put (81:46 - 81:52)
some of your most popular sword and (81:50 - 81:54)
shield pokemon like not even like one or (81:52 - 81:55)
like no yamper (81:54 - 81:57)
like no (81:55 - 81:59)
cinderace like it's (81:57 - 82:02)
they know which sword and shield pokemon (81:59 - 82:04)
are popular because they're 60 of all of (82:02 - 82:06)
their money is merchandise they they (82:04 - 82:08)
know which ones are (82:06 - 82:09)
selling plushes (82:08 - 82:12)
especially as this is a game about uh (82:09 - 82:15)
people colonizing an area and we all (82:12 - 82:16)
know those people from gala are big (82:15 - 82:17)
colonizers (82:16 - 82:19)
[Laughter] (82:17 - 82:23)
they have not set a game in spain yet (82:19 - 82:23)
i just i just think the the correlation (82:24 - 82:27)
between (82:26 - 82:30)
not having all the pokemon and like also (82:27 - 82:32)
then doubling down on we're not even (82:30 - 82:34)
going to put a gen 8 pokemon in here is (82:32 - 82:37)
like very similar thought processes of (82:34 - 82:40)
like no this is the game we want to make (82:37 - 82:42)
and we don't need to like (82:40 - 82:44)
stick (82:42 - 82:44)
whatever in here to make it sell like it (82:45 - 82:48)
just (82:47 - 82:49)
yeah (82:48 - 82:50)
like it was also weird to me that (82:49 - 82:51)
diamond and pearl didn't have any get (82:50 - 82:55)
like alolan forms or gallerian forms (82:51 - 82:57)
when let's go pikachu let's go eevee did (82:55 - 83:00)
have alolan forms like (82:57 - 83:00)
there is an interesting thing as well (83:01 - 83:04)
there are (83:02 - 83:04)
i mean feel free to cut this but if you (83:05 - 83:08)
don't want to end but there is one (83:06 - 83:10)
alolan form (83:08 - 83:11)
uh in the game (83:10 - 83:14)
in legends oh okay (83:11 - 83:18)
uh as well as its normal form (83:14 - 83:18)
and i guess that kind of (83:18 - 83:21)
moves towards the same idea if they've (83:19 - 83:23)
decided to put one in and no others (83:21 - 83:25)
there's obviously a reason they've done (83:23 - 83:26)
that (83:25 - 83:27)
and (83:26 - 83:28)
yeah i do i agree i think it's great if (83:27 - 83:30)
they can actually go this is the game we (83:28 - 83:32)
artistically want to make and we're not (83:30 - 83:34)
making this game just to sell although (83:32 - 83:35)
obviously they are making it to sell (83:34 - 83:37)
it's still a game (83:35 - 83:39)
in a capitalist society but if they can (83:37 - 83:40)
more go this is what we want to make (83:39 - 83:42)
we're not just putting in charizard (83:40 - 83:44)
because we want to put them in or (83:42 - 83:46)
because you want them to be in (83:44 - 83:47)
you know we're going to put in the (83:46 - 83:48)
pokemon we want that's great (83:47 - 83:50)
even if you don't like the artistic (83:48 - 83:51)
vision it's good that you can you can (83:50 - 83:55)
see what their vision actually is (83:51 - 83:55)
uh another change here is pokemon no (83:55 - 84:00)
longer evolve automatically (83:57 - 84:01)
yeah (84:00 - 84:03)
which is a crazy change (84:01 - 84:05)
some pokemon can undergo evolution which (84:03 - 84:06)
changes their appearance and stats if (84:05 - 84:08)
one of your pokemon has met the (84:06 - 84:09)
requirements to evolve you can then (84:08 - 84:11)
select evolve option by viewing them in (84:09 - 84:13)
your satchel your satchel is just like (84:11 - 84:15)
your pc bag (84:13 - 84:19)
is this for all pokemon (84:15 - 84:22)
all pokemon that evolve (84:19 - 84:22)
i think the core concept is that rather (84:22 - 84:27)
than always having to stop a pokemon (84:25 - 84:30)
from evolving you instead have to (84:27 - 84:32)
inspire the pokemon to evolve when you (84:30 - 84:36)
are ready for it to evolve (84:32 - 84:37)
i want to see if you can do it during a (84:36 - 84:39)
battle i've not seen anyone try that yet (84:37 - 84:41)
in the middle of a battle (84:39 - 84:42)
yeah like in the anime yeah like the (84:41 - 84:45)
anime yeah ash isn't holding b every (84:42 - 84:46)
time pikachu's because (84:45 - 84:48)
because when you're when the pokemon is (84:46 - 84:50)
in the battle it won't be in the satchel (84:48 - 84:52)
right and they specifically said the (84:50 - 84:54)
evolve buttons in the satchel (84:52 - 84:55)
that doesn't mean you can't select it in (84:54 - 84:58)
there though it's actually like i i some (84:55 - 85:01)
of these posts are off reddit so like (84:58 - 85:02)
pokemon do not need to evolve no (85:01 - 85:04)
evolution no no need to cancel an (85:02 - 85:05)
evolution which is something i've been (85:04 - 85:06)
doing a lot in brilliant diamond shining (85:05 - 85:07)
pearl (85:06 - 85:09)
um (85:07 - 85:10)
because i don't want certain shiny (85:09 - 85:12)
pokemon to evolve and then it's like (85:10 - 85:13)
well i can't put another stone on them (85:12 - 85:15)
because then that stops its ability of (85:13 - 85:17)
pickup and i need it to it's in my party (85:15 - 85:18)
because i want it to pick up but i don't (85:17 - 85:21)
want it to um (85:18 - 85:24)
it's it's crazy how positive the (85:21 - 85:26)
comments are about this change because (85:24 - 85:28)
like in my head (85:26 - 85:30)
i wouldn't have thought of this (85:28 - 85:32)
it's like if it's not broken don't fix (85:30 - 85:35)
it it's always been you know cyndaquil (85:32 - 85:36)
evolves at whatever level and then it (85:35 - 85:39)
evolves at whatever level again (85:36 - 85:40)
and if you don't want it you either ever (85:39 - 85:43)
stoner or you just press b every level (85:40 - 85:45)
but like literally everyone is like this (85:43 - 85:47)
is crazy like this is a great change oh (85:45 - 85:49)
my gosh (85:47 - 85:52)
and i agree with them it's just (85:49 - 85:54)
i've never seen so many people agree (85:52 - 85:55)
positively (85:54 - 85:57)
that's true but it goes back to what i (85:55 - 85:59)
said right the starters are all cute (85:57 - 86:01)
nobody wants them to i there's a reason (85:59 - 86:05)
i have a level 100 chest pin okay (86:01 - 86:07)
because i wanted it to be cute but there (86:05 - 86:10)
they also do make it clear (86:07 - 86:12)
in the games that pokemon unevolved (86:10 - 86:15)
pokemon learn moves faster (86:12 - 86:19)
yeah so that is like a specific strategy (86:15 - 86:21)
if you want a lower level pokemon to (86:19 - 86:24)
know a particular move (86:21 - 86:24)
yeah (86:24 - 86:25)
right (86:24 - 86:26)
um (86:25 - 86:28)
a couple other things before we wrap up (86:26 - 86:30)
so i i don't have the tweet in front of (86:28 - 86:31)
me i'm super sorry there was a tweet (86:30 - 86:33)
that said that if you just looked at the (86:31 - 86:35)
credits for sword and shield there was i (86:33 - 86:37)
believe 43 people who'd worked on the (86:35 - 86:40)
anna pokemon animation i could get that (86:37 - 86:41)
number slightly wrong (86:40 - 86:44)
um and then they said that when they (86:41 - 86:45)
quote unquote beat (86:44 - 86:46)
legends (86:45 - 86:48)
who knows what they did they probably (86:46 - 86:49)
demanded (86:48 - 86:50)
uh the (86:49 - 86:53)
the pokemon model animation team for (86:50 - 86:56)
legends was like 59 or something (86:53 - 86:59)
uh so they added more people to pokemon (86:56 - 87:01)
animations (86:59 - 87:03)
it's not a drastic change though (87:01 - 87:05)
15 more people i think something like (87:03 - 87:07)
that yeah 20 25 (87:05 - 87:09)
yeah that's not (87:07 - 87:11)
you know that 50 it doesn't feel to me (87:09 - 87:14)
like a completely mind-bending change (87:11 - 87:18)
yeah but one-third the pokedex (87:14 - 87:18)
well that's that i mean that probably (87:18 - 87:21)
does a better (87:19 - 87:23)
that gives you more of an idea of where (87:21 - 87:25)
the improvement comes from (87:23 - 87:27)
well but this is the reason why they (87:25 - 87:28)
this is one of the reasons why they cut (87:27 - 87:30)
the pokedex that people were upset about (87:28 - 87:32)
they said like we're cutting the pokedex (87:30 - 87:33)
so we can focus on pokemon animations (87:32 - 87:35)
and people are like oh tail whip is (87:33 - 87:37)
still the same yeah why would they spend (87:35 - 87:40)
any amount of effort with tail whip (87:37 - 87:42)
when they have 80 new pokemon that they (87:40 - 87:45)
need like to walk around they need to (87:42 - 87:47)
model they need to like like are we just (87:45 - 87:49)
ignoring the fact that they're adding (87:47 - 87:52)
like there are new animations sorry they (87:49 - 87:54)
didn't animate tail whip better they (87:52 - 87:55)
animated hype (87:54 - 87:58)
no i seem to remember like seven years (87:55 - 87:59)
ago (87:58 - 88:01)
you specifically saying that you wanted (87:59 - 88:04)
the pokemon to actually like perform the (88:01 - 88:06)
moves (88:04 - 88:06)
well (88:07 - 88:11)
you're a tail whip dude i am not like (88:08 - 88:13)
i'm not a tail whip dude (88:11 - 88:16)
uh (88:13 - 88:16)
i i posted here a picture of a old (88:16 - 88:22)
cyndaquil a new syndical (88:19 - 88:24)
they like completely read it it's flames (88:22 - 88:26)
and stuff which is is really cool so (88:24 - 88:27)
that's just like one minor like (88:26 - 88:30)
animation thing they they did change (88:27 - 88:33)
um but i think this is like (88:30 - 88:34)
this is just speculation but i would (88:33 - 88:36)
assume that this is their strategy right (88:34 - 88:38)
we're putting x amount of pokemon in (88:36 - 88:41)
this game this gives us time to work on (88:38 - 88:44)
these specific pokemon if we (88:41 - 88:46)
if these pokemon return in a new game we (88:44 - 88:48)
can copy and paste (88:46 - 88:50)
what we've worked on here (88:48 - 88:52)
and then in the new game if we're adding (88:50 - 88:54)
you know skitty who might not be in this (88:52 - 88:57)
game we can now focus on skitty put it (88:54 - 88:59)
into this new game and now going forward (88:57 - 89:00)
skiddy's ready to go for the next game (88:59 - 89:03)
like it lets them work on pokemon in (89:00 - 89:04)
chunks (89:03 - 89:07)
instead of trying to change (89:04 - 89:10)
900 pokemon every three years (89:07 - 89:13)
true going forward (89:10 - 89:15)
like it's it's really smart (89:13 - 89:17)
in a sense of like (89:15 - 89:18)
we only have 60 people there's 900 (89:17 - 89:20)
pokemon (89:18 - 89:22)
and you guys and that's not even (89:20 - 89:25)
including moves that's (89:22 - 89:26)
like the pokemon still need their own (89:25 - 89:27)
animations (89:26 - 89:30)
the moves need their own animations (89:27 - 89:31)
um (89:30 - 89:32)
yeah because the other the other way to (89:31 - 89:34)
do it is you spend much longer making (89:32 - 89:35)
the game (89:34 - 89:37)
right with the same amount of people and (89:35 - 89:38)
then you end up having everything (89:37 - 89:40)
improved but the the thing that people (89:38 - 89:42)
always forget when they when they (89:40 - 89:43)
mention that is (89:42 - 89:44)
i mean your game is going to be more (89:43 - 89:46)
expensive then (89:44 - 89:47)
right because they've suddenly decided (89:46 - 89:49)
that they're taking a massive pay cut (89:47 - 89:52)
otherwise (89:49 - 89:52)
yeah you know (89:52 - 89:56)
because if they're gonna spell put one (89:54 - 89:58)
game out instead of four or three or (89:56 - 89:59)
whatever (89:58 - 90:02)
do you really expect that you're gonna (89:59 - 90:03)
pay the same amount of money for that (90:02 - 90:04)
game (90:03 - 90:06)
well that's that was the thing with (90:04 - 90:07)
sword and shield where people were like (90:06 - 90:09)
sword and shields rushed okay first off (90:07 - 90:10)
literally every video game in the entire (90:09 - 90:13)
world is rushed spoiler yeah true (90:10 - 90:15)
no video game is ending like six months (90:13 - 90:16)
earlier and they're like wow what are we (90:15 - 90:18)
gonna do bob (90:16 - 90:20)
really knock that vid like every game (90:18 - 90:22)
can continue to be worked on and ships (90:20 - 90:24)
at the door no changes (90:22 - 90:27)
but like do you really think another (90:24 - 90:29)
year of working on sword and shield (90:27 - 90:32)
would equate to x amount more sales like (90:29 - 90:34)
sword and shield sold 24 million copies (90:32 - 90:35)
it's going to be the second best-selling (90:34 - 90:37)
pokemon game of all time it will pass (90:35 - 90:39)
gold and silver (90:37 - 90:40)
in its lifetime (90:39 - 90:42)
yeah (90:40 - 90:44)
does another year (90:42 - 90:46)
equate an extra 1 million dollars in (90:44 - 90:49)
sales to like you're paying (90:46 - 90:52)
your whole staff a full year of stuff (90:49 - 90:55)
a full year of money to (90:52 - 90:58)
equate like you don't get that back (90:55 - 91:00)
i don't think so at a certain point you (90:58 - 91:01)
just have to like (91:00 - 91:03)
we have to ship this and we have to (91:01 - 91:05)
start another game because we have to (91:03 - 91:07)
pay people and we have to like i get it (91:05 - 91:09)
they have all this money i like i (91:07 - 91:10)
understand the people listening being (91:09 - 91:12)
like well the pokemon company is the (91:10 - 91:14)
most profitable yeah when they sell a (91:12 - 91:17)
bonsai plush game freak isn't suddenly (91:14 - 91:19)
getting more money to like improve the (91:17 - 91:21)
yamper animation that's not how it works (91:19 - 91:24)
like like most of their money are from (91:21 - 91:27)
stuffed animals like that's (91:24 - 91:28)
i'm just imagining them putting that on (91:27 - 91:29)
the tagline it's like you know how (91:28 - 91:30)
sometimes when you you're buying (91:29 - 91:32)
something and it like pays for someone (91:30 - 91:34)
to get something for free when they're (91:32 - 91:36)
in poverty it's like yeah (91:34 - 91:39)
yeah you're you're improving the young (91:36 - 91:41)
animations by one percent the real (91:39 - 91:44)
secret it's those 99 community day (91:41 - 91:47)
special researches that pay for the good (91:44 - 91:48)
animations and it's all the people who (91:47 - 91:51)
refuse to pay for those that are holding (91:48 - 91:52)
us back (91:51 - 91:54)
that's right (91:52 - 91:55)
so another interesting thing that came (91:54 - 91:57)
out of this this is kind of like (91:55 - 91:58)
obviously i would assume people (91:57 - 91:59)
listening to the podcast are more (91:58 - 92:01)
hardcore pokemon fans so they probably (91:59 - 92:02)
appreciate this (92:01 - 92:03)
um (92:02 - 92:04)
so (92:03 - 92:07)
uh directors of the video games (92:04 - 92:10)
um so masuda is the one that always gets (92:07 - 92:11)
flagged for (92:10 - 92:12)
everything wrong with the pokemon (92:11 - 92:13)
company (92:12 - 92:16)
[Laughter] (92:13 - 92:20)
uh masuda was uh first directing (92:16 - 92:22)
if i remember correctly he was the (92:20 - 92:24)
director on ruby and sapphire that was (92:22 - 92:25)
his first game (92:24 - 92:27)
if i recall and then he did fire red (92:25 - 92:29)
leaf green (92:27 - 92:30)
um (92:29 - 92:31)
he's also done pretty much like all the (92:30 - 92:34)
music i think since like gold and silver (92:31 - 92:36)
or something like that he's done a lot (92:34 - 92:39)
of music yes uh he also directed black (92:36 - 92:41)
and white (92:39 - 92:41)
he (92:41 - 92:42)
did (92:41 - 92:44)
he directed i believe diamond and pearl (92:42 - 92:47)
yes diamond pearl he directed x and y (92:44 - 92:48)
um (92:47 - 92:49)
and then (92:48 - 92:51)
he (92:49 - 92:53)
did not do really anything after that (92:51 - 92:55)
besides music (92:53 - 92:57)
um and then he (92:55 - 92:59)
directed (92:57 - 93:01)
uh let's go pikachu let's go evie which (92:59 - 93:03)
he then said was like this is probably (93:01 - 93:05)
the last game i'm going to direct (93:03 - 93:08)
um and then he apparently he helped (93:05 - 93:10)
direct brilliant diamond shining pearl (93:08 - 93:12)
for whatever that's worth even though he (93:10 - 93:14)
works at (93:12 - 93:17)
yeah he i i think it was probably as i (93:14 - 93:19)
kind of like uh (93:17 - 93:21)
not passing the torch kind of thing like (93:19 - 93:22)
they're the future of pokemon but like (93:21 - 93:24)
that link to (93:22 - 93:27)
the actual team that makes other pokemon (93:24 - 93:29)
games if that makes sense yeah (93:27 - 93:34)
um masuda hand-picked amore though (93:29 - 93:35)
to (93:34 - 93:37)
like replace him as like the main (93:35 - 93:38)
director obviously the games i just (93:37 - 93:40)
listed like x and y black and white (93:38 - 93:45)
obviously incredibly huge pokemon games (93:40 - 93:46)
um (93:45 - 93:49)
but the first game that uh (93:46 - 93:52)
amore directed (93:49 - 93:53)
if i'm getting this correct would be (93:52 - 93:55)
omega ruby alpha sapphire (93:53 - 93:58)
he then directed sun and moon (93:55 - 94:03)
and then he directed sword and shield (93:58 - 94:03)
so he did not direct legends (94:03 - 94:09)
and obviously he did not direct (94:07 - 94:11)
brilliant diamond shining pearl (94:09 - 94:12)
he hasn't done anything since sword and (94:11 - 94:15)
shield (94:12 - 94:15)
probably (94:15 - 94:21)
probably safe to say that amore the one (94:17 - 94:22)
who (94:21 - 94:25)
directed sun and moon and sword and (94:22 - 94:27)
shield probably directing whatever gen 9 (94:25 - 94:28)
is (94:27 - 94:30)
i would agree with you (94:28 - 94:31)
probably safe to say that's what he's (94:30 - 94:33)
been doing since sword and shield has (94:31 - 94:36)
completed which was going to be almost (94:33 - 94:38)
three years ago (94:36 - 94:39)
we did find out just because of the (94:38 - 94:43)
credits of legends that ewow (94:39 - 94:44)
is the director (94:43 - 94:46)
of legends (94:44 - 94:48)
he was the last director of ultra sun (94:46 - 94:50)
ultra moon (94:48 - 94:52)
so (94:50 - 94:54)
possibly safe to say that ewow has been (94:52 - 94:57)
working on legends since the close of (94:54 - 94:59)
ultrasound ultra moon (94:57 - 95:01)
since (94:59 - 95:02)
he was only the planning director for (95:01 - 95:05)
sword and shield not the main director (95:02 - 95:06)
um (95:05 - 95:08)
and we know that game freak they mix (95:06 - 95:10)
they have two teams at a time obviously (95:08 - 95:12)
we found out that the biggest news was (95:10 - 95:13)
like they weren't working on diamond and (95:12 - 95:15)
pearl that that's why they're probably (95:13 - 95:17)
been able to do (95:15 - 95:20)
legends and what is eventually will be (95:17 - 95:21)
gen 9 whether that's this year or next (95:20 - 95:23)
year or the year after (95:21 - 95:26)
um (95:23 - 95:28)
and i think that ultrasound ultramoon (95:26 - 95:31)
was ewow's first (95:28 - 95:33)
game that he directed i think you're (95:31 - 95:35)
right on that yes um he's been with the (95:33 - 95:37)
company since black and white but yeah (95:35 - 95:41)
he is the director of legends (95:37 - 95:42)
so we have three directors that have (95:41 - 95:44)
been in rotation for (95:42 - 95:46)
quite a while (95:44 - 95:47)
and (95:46 - 95:49)
masuda was (95:47 - 95:51)
diamond and pearl and then let's go (95:49 - 95:53)
ewow was ultrasound ultramoon and sword (95:51 - 95:58)
and shield and amore was gen (95:53 - 95:59)
eight (95:58 - 96:02)
and what has he been doing (95:59 - 96:05)
probably gen9 (96:02 - 96:05)
crazy idea i can't imagine he's not (96:05 - 96:09)
working on like he could be working on (96:07 - 96:11)
something else but then who is this a (96:09 - 96:13)
random mysterious developer like (96:11 - 96:15)
director for gen 9 like it has to be (96:13 - 96:17)
amore (96:15 - 96:18)
and it will be very interesting to see (96:17 - 96:21)
as well you know how much of uh (96:18 - 96:22)
gen 9 does (96:21 - 96:25)
not just in terms of like concepts bring (96:22 - 96:27)
from this game but also in terms of (96:25 - 96:28)
actual (96:27 - 96:32)
you know engine code wise um (96:28 - 96:33)
like (96:32 - 96:34)
will they both build on the same thing (96:33 - 96:36)
like with x y and (96:34 - 96:39)
or us um (96:36 - 96:40)
or will it be completely different like (96:39 - 96:41)
because (96:40 - 96:43)
i think we all kind of expected that (96:41 - 96:45)
maybe there would be something similar (96:43 - 96:48)
to let's go afterwards because it looked (96:45 - 96:49)
very different i think it was built on a (96:48 - 96:52)
lot of similar code with sun and moon uh (96:49 - 96:54)
although it's always hard to tell (96:52 - 96:55)
but (96:54 - 96:56)
do you know what's always shield was (96:55 - 96:59)
such a drastic change from that (96:56 - 97:01)
yeah do you know what i think about (96:59 - 97:03)
though from time to time is like (97:01 - 97:05)
you look at a game like ultra sun and (97:03 - 97:08)
moon and you're like this is the game (97:05 - 97:10)
like there's zero reason to buy sun and (97:08 - 97:13)
moon when ultra exists you could argue (97:10 - 97:14)
that the story in sun and moon is better (97:13 - 97:16)
and i agree the story in sun and moon is (97:14 - 97:18)
better they dropped the ball (97:16 - 97:21)
uh story wise but mechanically (97:18 - 97:23)
ultra sun and ultra moon is a better (97:21 - 97:25)
like there's no reason to ever buy (97:23 - 97:28)
diamond and pearl when platinum exists (97:25 - 97:30)
like diamond and pearl is probably the (97:28 - 97:31)
worst (97:30 - 97:33)
mechanically (97:31 - 97:36)
and pokemon game ever made it's at the (97:33 - 97:37)
bottom of the list but like platinum is (97:36 - 97:40)
like a top five game (97:37 - 97:42)
yeah like like if you have the choice (97:40 - 97:45)
like if money wasn't a thing (97:42 - 97:46)
there's no reason to play original (97:45 - 97:48)
diamond and pearl over platinum if (97:46 - 97:50)
they're both i wonder whether this is i (97:48 - 97:52)
wonder what this is why they they're (97:50 - 97:53)
trying to do i mean i say trying to (97:52 - 97:55)
they've done it literally once so far (97:53 - 97:57)
but you know going towards more the idea (97:55 - 97:58)
of dlc because that allows you to (97:57 - 98:00)
improve your game rather than release a (97:58 - 98:02)
new game (98:00 - 98:03)
um (98:02 - 98:04)
with (98:03 - 98:07)
probably a similar amount of work (98:04 - 98:10)
but isis you know you're (98:07 - 98:12)
in a way your audience is reduced but (98:10 - 98:13)
because you have to have the original (98:12 - 98:15)
game to get it but in another way it's (98:13 - 98:16)
not really because (98:15 - 98:18)
i'm not really sure there's people who (98:16 - 98:19)
are going (98:18 - 98:20)
and then some people say that they (98:19 - 98:22)
always wait for they always waited for (98:20 - 98:23)
the third game but i don't think those (98:22 - 98:25)
people actually exist right i think they (98:23 - 98:26)
just say they did (98:25 - 98:29)
uh nobody when diamond and pearl were (98:26 - 98:30)
coming out was going oh wait for the (98:29 - 98:33)
third one yeah i just don't think that (98:30 - 98:34)
was a thing you know (98:33 - 98:36)
yeah i remember (98:34 - 98:38)
i i remember talking to one person when (98:36 - 98:40)
x and y came out and they were like i'm (98:38 - 98:42)
just gonna wait for the whatever z is (98:40 - 98:43)
and it's like (98:42 - 98:45)
good luck you like pokemon enough to buy (98:43 - 98:47)
the game and this game just came out and (98:45 - 98:48)
it's like (98:47 - 98:50)
x and y was like the first pokemon game (98:48 - 98:52)
with like 3d models everywhere like it (98:50 - 98:55)
was a huge leap forward and that's not (98:52 - 98:57)
good enough for you to be like (98:55 - 98:58)
i'm going to spend 40 today you're gonna (98:57 - 98:59)
be like (98:58 - 99:02)
no i'm gonna wait a full like it's it's (98:59 - 99:04)
very jarring (99:02 - 99:05)
uh (99:04 - 99:06)
but whatever until no one else is (99:05 - 99:07)
playing it so that i have no one to (99:06 - 99:09)
trade with (99:07 - 99:11)
what i was gonna say is maybe this is (99:09 - 99:14)
like the opposite whereas like we make (99:11 - 99:16)
an engine for like sun and moon or we (99:14 - 99:18)
make an engine for diamond and pearl and (99:16 - 99:20)
then we improve on that and then (99:18 - 99:22)
platinum comes out we improve on that (99:20 - 99:24)
and then ultrasound ultramoon comes out (99:22 - 99:26)
what if this is the opposite this is (99:24 - 99:29)
like hey this is our new engine (99:26 - 99:32)
but instead of making a whole game (99:29 - 99:34)
well this is probably a whole game right (99:32 - 99:35)
it seems like a whole game when you (99:34 - 99:37)
watch people playing you're like oh this (99:35 - 99:38)
is actually a video game (99:37 - 99:40)
but we're making a foundation here for (99:38 - 99:42)
the engine (99:40 - 99:44)
we're shipping this game (99:42 - 99:46)
and now we're going to expand and make (99:44 - 99:49)
that better for a gen 9 (99:46 - 99:50)
like it's almost like they flipped it (99:49 - 99:54)
here maybe yeah i see unless they're so (99:50 - 99:56)
what you're saying is legends is a gen 9 (99:54 - 99:57)
game (99:56 - 99:59)
yes (99:57 - 100:01)
confirmed you heard it here first (99:59 - 100:04)
i did not say that no (100:01 - 100:04)
there are shinies in the overworld here (100:05 - 100:11)
there was a a brave soul who found a (100:08 - 100:13)
shiny crow gunk (100:11 - 100:16)
they saved in front of the shiny crow (100:13 - 100:17)
gunk (100:16 - 100:19)
they turned off their game (100:17 - 100:21)
they said i saved before fighting the (100:19 - 100:23)
shiny crow gunk i killed it on purpose (100:21 - 100:24)
restarted my game when i walked forward (100:23 - 100:27)
a few feet he was there (100:24 - 100:28)
um (100:27 - 100:31)
so this is similar to how sword and (100:28 - 100:33)
shield worked (100:31 - 100:35)
in sword and shield the the only (100:33 - 100:37)
difference is they weren't shiny in the (100:35 - 100:39)
overworld but if you saved (100:37 - 100:41)
in front of (100:39 - 100:42)
like uh (100:41 - 100:44)
caldeo is a good example even though (100:42 - 100:46)
kelvio can't be shiny spoiler keldios (100:44 - 100:47)
and sword and shield (100:46 - 100:49)
in case you didn't know that (100:47 - 100:51)
if you saved in front of keldeo and you (100:49 - 100:55)
walked into it and it had like the (100:51 - 100:57)
apathetic mark (100:55 - 100:59)
and you knocked it out and you reset and (100:57 - 101:00)
you walked in front of it again it would (100:59 - 101:02)
still have the apathetic mark it would (101:00 - 101:04)
also still have the same evs or not not (101:02 - 101:07)
ev sorry iv is the same nature it would (101:04 - 101:09)
have all of that because once you look (101:07 - 101:10)
at it (101:09 - 101:11)
it locks that in (101:10 - 101:13)
if you were to (101:11 - 101:15)
save in front of keldeo (101:13 - 101:18)
apathetic mark knock it out (101:15 - 101:20)
start back in front of it leave the area (101:18 - 101:23)
for it to like despawn and then come (101:20 - 101:26)
back it would be different it would (101:23 - 101:28)
be like a different nature (101:26 - 101:29)
this is slightly different because he's (101:28 - 101:31)
saying that it wasn't spawned there (101:29 - 101:33)
right he had to walk forward and then (101:31 - 101:34)
spawned again (101:33 - 101:36)
uh i think that might just be uh (101:34 - 101:38)
language like he didn't mention the (101:36 - 101:41)
first time that he walked forward (101:38 - 101:43)
yeah because he when he's from my (101:41 - 101:45)
understanding he saved when he was like (101:43 - 101:46)
looking at it (101:45 - 101:48)
yeah i know but then you're saying you (101:46 - 101:49)
say (101:48 - 101:50)
you said (101:49 - 101:52)
i walked and it spawned up again and it (101:50 - 101:55)
was shiny did you not maybe i missed it (101:52 - 101:56)
yeah maybe you're right maybe it's a (101:55 - 101:57)
wedding thing and i just misheard it but (101:56 - 102:01)
i think he worded it poorly yeah (101:57 - 102:02)
i think what he's saying is like i saved (102:01 - 102:05)
in front of a shiny (102:02 - 102:06)
i turned off the game i turned it back (102:05 - 102:08)
on it was still shiny (102:06 - 102:10)
yeah i don't think he like (102:08 - 102:12)
saw because i'm going to assume (102:10 - 102:15)
that if you see a shiny (102:12 - 102:16)
because there's draw distance in the (102:15 - 102:17)
game (102:16 - 102:19)
yeah and you walk far enough away from (102:17 - 102:20)
it (102:19 - 102:21)
it's gone forever (102:20 - 102:24)
because it's going to despawn (102:21 - 102:26)
so it's weird and how it works and let's (102:24 - 102:27)
go pikachu let's go eevee let's go (102:26 - 102:29)
pikachu let's go eevee every single (102:27 - 102:31)
pokemon that spawned was on a 30 second (102:29 - 102:32)
timer (102:31 - 102:34)
and after 30 seconds that pokemon is (102:32 - 102:37)
gone that's what made like shiny hunting (102:34 - 102:39)
like exciting for some people right like (102:37 - 102:41)
it's like oh i don't know how i don't i (102:39 - 102:43)
just saw this caterpie how long has it (102:41 - 102:45)
been up for i'm running to it oh the (102:43 - 102:48)
timer's over it despawns it's gone (102:45 - 102:49)
the worst and sword and shield didn't (102:48 - 102:51)
work like that because in sword and (102:49 - 102:52)
shield if you're standing in the wild (102:51 - 102:54)
area and you got like five duskuls (102:52 - 102:56)
floating around you (102:54 - 102:58)
you could be there for two hours (102:56 - 103:00)
those are going to be the same five (102:58 - 103:01)
duskulls if you don't move they're not (103:00 - 103:04)
going to despawn they will despawn when (103:01 - 103:07)
you get far enough away for the draw (103:04 - 103:09)
distance to go (103:07 - 103:11)
goodbye i'm assuming that's how it works (103:09 - 103:13)
here but no one's really talked about (103:11 - 103:15)
that (103:13 - 103:16)
yeah i'm not sure (103:15 - 103:18)
so i would assume like you're galloping (103:16 - 103:21)
on weird deer you see shiny crow gunk (103:18 - 103:23)
you stop to catch it because it's not (103:21 - 103:25)
going to despawn but the only way it (103:23 - 103:27)
does despawn is if you (103:25 - 103:29)
just like (103:27 - 103:30)
you leave (103:29 - 103:31)
the area and come back (103:30 - 103:34)
it can run away as well um i saw someone (103:31 - 103:36)
run up to shiny and start the battle and (103:34 - 103:39)
it just immediately fled what (103:36 - 103:41)
because they because they'd scared our (103:39 - 103:42)
way (103:41 - 103:42)
oh (103:42 - 103:45)
you mean like if you run up to it rather (103:42 - 103:47)
than staring in like yeah and like sword (103:45 - 103:50)
and shield where like rookie d is it (103:47 - 103:52)
rickety rickety runs from you right like (103:50 - 103:53)
oh there's a lot of things that run from (103:52 - 103:55)
yeah but yeah but what but it was even (103:53 - 103:58)
it was after the battle started so they (103:55 - 104:01)
they ran up to it it saw them they threw (103:58 - 104:04)
a pokeball pokemon at it the pokeball (104:01 - 104:05)
with the pokemon in it at it to start (104:04 - 104:07)
the battle and because they'd already (104:05 - 104:09)
scared it running up to it before the (104:07 - 104:11)
first turn it just fled and that was (104:09 - 104:13)
good that's crazy (104:11 - 104:14)
so you need to sneak up on your shiny (104:13 - 104:17)
pokemon and yeah save before (104:14 - 104:19)
the other interesting thing about the (104:17 - 104:21)
shiny pokemon is actually the uh is they (104:19 - 104:23)
have a shiny sound in the overworld as (104:21 - 104:24)
well (104:23 - 104:26)
um which it looks like they have the (104:24 - 104:27)
sparkle (104:26 - 104:30)
they do yeah they're like under (104:27 - 104:33)
and so oh you mean in the (104:30 - 104:35)
in the menu so the krogan i'm looking at (104:33 - 104:37)
it says cr it says level 22 at the top (104:35 - 104:39)
it then says crow gunk it then says mail (104:37 - 104:41)
and then next to it there's like the (104:39 - 104:43)
pokemon go (104:41 - 104:45)
shine indicator here i'll link it for (104:43 - 104:47)
you this is this the one in the in (104:45 - 104:50)
battle or is this in there um they are (104:47 - 104:51)
not in battle they are in battle because (104:50 - 104:54)
the koi lava is out looking at it (104:51 - 104:56)
oh yes uh yes i see we mean so when (104:54 - 104:58)
you're actually in the battle it makes (104:56 - 105:00)
it clear so for pokemon with stupid (104:58 - 105:04)
chinese you can still know it's shiny (105:00 - 105:07)
um so it's really cool (105:04 - 105:07)
but it the this the shiny sound is (105:11 - 105:14)
useful because you don't end up in a (105:13 - 105:16)
situation where you had in lights go (105:14 - 105:19)
where there's a shiny pokemon it's just (105:16 - 105:20)
on the other side of the area it's (105:19 - 105:22)
spawned but you can't see it on the (105:20 - 105:23)
screen (105:22 - 105:25)
yeah and you never knew you saw it (105:23 - 105:26)
what shame (105:25 - 105:28)
whereas you hear the shiny sound you go (105:26 - 105:30)
oh shiny i need to go find it now which (105:28 - 105:31)
i love the idea of (105:30 - 105:33)
this uh this episode has been too (105:31 - 105:35)
positive let me complain here uh when (105:33 - 105:36)
you're radar hunting and brilliant (105:35 - 105:38)
diamond shutting pearl and the shiny (105:36 - 105:40)
patch shows up it does not make a sound (105:38 - 105:43)
it is infuriating (105:40 - 105:45)
especially if you're in the the root (105:43 - 105:46)
with the sandstorm it's dreadful trying (105:45 - 105:48)
to see anything there i was hunting in (105:46 - 105:49)
the (105:48 - 105:51)
cheryl forest and there's like part of (105:49 - 105:53)
grass that's just gaussian blurred out (105:51 - 105:55)
forest yeah because it's like so blurry (105:53 - 105:58)
down there yeah the blood in that forest (105:55 - 106:00)
is horrific (105:58 - 106:02)
it's it's very it's very bad um (106:00 - 106:05)
so the the shiny stuff seems cool i'm (106:02 - 106:07)
sure there's some sort of method i'm (106:05 - 106:10)
sure that uh you know people will be (106:07 - 106:11)
wrong about it for three weeks and then (106:10 - 106:13)
like sword and shield will learn how to (106:11 - 106:15)
actually do it in two years (106:13 - 106:16)
there was only one thing they were wrong (106:15 - 106:18)
about in brilliant diamond shining peril (106:16 - 106:19)
and that was the digletts (106:18 - 106:21)
that's the only thing they were wrong (106:19 - 106:23)
about wait it wasn't the original one (106:21 - 106:25)
so originally someone thought that (106:23 - 106:26)
getting to the certain amount of (106:25 - 106:28)
digletts increased the shiny odds (106:26 - 106:30)
but it doesn't (106:28 - 106:31)
that's been proven wrong (106:30 - 106:34)
yeah it only increases the chances of (106:31 - 106:36)
one of the shiny statues (106:34 - 106:39)
oh it doesn't increase shiny ads at all (106:36 - 106:41)
now when did this come out (106:39 - 106:44)
it was pretty quickly after the initial (106:41 - 106:46)
oh because i still see a pin tweet by (106:44 - 106:48)
anubis who's one of the person and they (106:46 - 106:49)
still have it increase the shiny ads oh (106:48 - 106:51)
really (106:49 - 106:54)
because yeah noise it could (106:51 - 106:56)
if you do the the digging once you've (106:54 - 106:57)
got the diglett (106:56 - 107:00)
basically every statue you get is a is a (106:57 - 107:01)
color is it color statue is that what (107:00 - 107:04)
they're called yeah color statue yeah (107:01 - 107:06)
it's like basically every statue you get (107:04 - 107:08)
it's almost guaranteed that your your (107:06 - 107:11)
statue will be a color statue (107:08 - 107:13)
anubis does not have that pin tweet (107:11 - 107:14)
anymore (107:13 - 107:16)
there you go (107:14 - 107:16)
because the problem is that i think in (107:17 - 107:21)
in code it was called (107:19 - 107:24)
light stone yes and people assumed that (107:21 - 107:25)
that meant (107:24 - 107:29)
something to do with shiny but it didn't (107:25 - 107:30)
interesting so i think that was the only (107:29 - 107:32)
thing they got wrong all the other stuff (107:30 - 107:36)
was pretty much bang on (107:32 - 107:38)
there was maybe something slightly wrong (107:36 - 107:40)
with the audience possibly the worst (107:38 - 107:43)
slash most boring (107:40 - 107:43)
thing they could have done (107:43 - 107:47)
hallway simulator (107:45 - 107:49)
you like running up and down empty (107:47 - 107:52)
hallways the underground is for you (107:49 - 107:52)
um are we missing anything i mean (107:52 - 107:56)
there's uh there's (107:54 - 107:58)
yeah there's like a feather ball i think (107:56 - 108:00)
it's called (107:58 - 108:02)
um i could not find a good list of all (108:00 - 108:04)
the pokeballs just (108:02 - 108:06)
it's because again nobody actually data (108:04 - 108:08)
mined it so we're just seeing random (108:06 - 108:10)
stuff around the internet (108:08 - 108:12)
so data miners get on it please give us (108:10 - 108:13)
nice lists (108:12 - 108:15)
of data it looks like there are some (108:13 - 108:17)
joto balls like obviously the heavy ball (108:15 - 108:19)
is a pre-order bonus (108:17 - 108:20)
but it doesn't look like there's a love (108:19 - 108:22)
ball in the game it doesn't look like (108:20 - 108:25)
there's yeah no it's like a very limited (108:22 - 108:27)
selection of balls (108:25 - 108:30)
definitely i was expecting many more (108:27 - 108:31)
yeah (108:30 - 108:33)
um the new pokeballs was cool the last (108:31 - 108:35)
thing i think i want to talk about is (108:33 - 108:37)
two new status conditions (108:35 - 108:40)
there's yes frostbite (108:37 - 108:42)
and then there's i think drowsy (108:40 - 108:44)
yeah yeah it's really weird that like (108:42 - 108:46)
randomly drowsies will just come in and (108:44 - 108:50)
just sit on your it's it's wow (108:46 - 108:51)
wow (108:50 - 108:53)
real bold they're really pushing drowsy (108:51 - 108:55)
hard this jen um (108:53 - 109:01)
these are i i i saw frostbite and i saw (108:55 - 109:02)
the drowsy (109:01 - 109:04)
conditions (109:02 - 109:07)
uh i don't fully understand what they do (109:04 - 109:10)
um it looks like frostbite is just one (109:07 - 109:12)
turn of being actually frozen and then (109:10 - 109:15)
you're like taking burn damage (109:12 - 109:16)
yeah it's like it's kind of like the (109:15 - 109:19)
frozen version of burn (109:16 - 109:22)
um and i believe drowsy (109:19 - 109:24)
i think drowsy is like kind of like (109:22 - 109:25)
paralysis (109:24 - 109:27)
um (109:25 - 109:30)
it i think it decreases your (109:27 - 109:30)
speed and accuracy i think i can't (109:31 - 109:35)
remember the the but yeah instead of (109:33 - 109:37)
just being like frozen where you just (109:35 - 109:39)
can't move until you thought and (109:37 - 109:41)
the same with sleep they just change (109:39 - 109:44)
your stats like interesting the (109:41 - 109:46)
uh like the other one the other status (109:44 - 109:48)
conditions well it's it's weird status (109:46 - 109:49)
condition this gets it this goes back to (109:48 - 109:51)
competitive which is funny because like (109:49 - 109:53)
status conditions are like they can make (109:51 - 109:55)
a game (109:53 - 109:56)
like obviously going through the game (109:55 - 109:58)
battling is like fun and enjoyable and (109:56 - 110:01)
there's some strategy to it but like (109:58 - 110:04)
unless no like if you want to be super (110:01 - 110:06)
hardcore i guess you could sleep slash (110:04 - 110:08)
paralyze every single pokemon you go up (110:06 - 110:10)
to because that would be optimal and if (110:08 - 110:11)
you can't one shot it or if you're at (110:10 - 110:13)
his whatever but like (110:11 - 110:16)
it was always weird to me that burn (110:13 - 110:19)
and poison were pretty much the same (110:16 - 110:22)
minus burn would reduce your (110:19 - 110:24)
physical attack by half and there was (110:22 - 110:26)
nothing that would reduce your special (110:24 - 110:28)
attack by half like burn (110:26 - 110:30)
and there is like (110:28 - 110:32)
deep poison or what it's called what is (110:30 - 110:34)
it called like like toxic (110:32 - 110:36)
like extreme (110:34 - 110:38)
extremely poisoned yeah or where it (110:36 - 110:40)
would take more damage every turn and (110:38 - 110:42)
you could reset that by switching out (110:40 - 110:44)
and then like there wasn't really a (110:42 - 110:46)
difference between being frozen and (110:44 - 110:48)
being slept (110:46 - 110:50)
except (110:48 - 110:54)
that if you had a like flame wheel or (110:50 - 110:55)
skull you could get out of it but that (110:54 - 110:58)
was so situational (110:55 - 110:59)
yeah and it's like they're both kind of (110:58 - 111:02)
doing the same thing (110:59 - 111:02)
so like (111:03 - 111:07)
it's almost it almost felt like they (111:04 - 111:09)
needed just to redo all those status (111:07 - 111:11)
conditions and it's like it's drowsy (111:09 - 111:13)
similar to sleep but sleep is also (111:11 - 111:15)
similar to frozen and (111:13 - 111:17)
poison is kind of similar to burn except (111:15 - 111:19)
burn would be kind of better unless (111:17 - 111:21)
you're talking about toxic (111:19 - 111:24)
yeah so frostbite uh it (111:21 - 111:25)
it's yeah as you say it's like burning (111:24 - 111:28)
you get hurt by at the end of the turn (111:25 - 111:32)
but it reduces your special attack (111:28 - 111:33)
as (111:32 - 111:36)
well it reduces your special attack as (111:33 - 111:37)
well oh it does reduce your special (111:36 - 111:39)
attack yeah so you're not immobilized (111:37 - 111:41)
like you are with frozen it just it's (111:39 - 111:43)
burn but special attack (111:41 - 111:45)
yeah oh i did it with (111:43 - 111:48)
and with drozy it's uh (111:45 - 111:50)
i i can't i'm not seeing if there's any (111:48 - 111:51)
stat changes but (111:50 - 111:54)
you like paralysis is just you have a (111:51 - 111:55)
chance of not being able to do something (111:54 - 111:57)
that turn rather than just you can't do (111:55 - 112:01)
anything ever until you wake up (111:57 - 112:01)
the other thing i saw so new pokeballs (112:02 - 112:07)
new status conditions i saw a character (112:05 - 112:10)
like fog himself (112:07 - 112:12)
so there was like no grass to hide in so (112:10 - 112:14)
he like threw a smoke ball on top of (112:12 - 112:15)
himself and it was actually like it (112:14 - 112:18)
graphically it looked like ninja skills (112:15 - 112:19)
um (112:18 - 112:20)
it was probably like one of the uglier (112:19 - 112:22)
things that i saw in the game because i (112:20 - 112:24)
do think the game is there are moments (112:22 - 112:26)
of the game that are very pretty (112:24 - 112:28)
um and then there are moments like when (112:26 - 112:30)
he smoke balled himself where i was like (112:28 - 112:32)
what happened here is this (112:30 - 112:34)
because it's like an ms emulator blame (112:32 - 112:37)
it on the emulator um but he like smoked (112:34 - 112:38)
ball himself so he could hide so he (112:37 - 112:40)
could like sneak up on i don't know what (112:38 - 112:42)
he was sneaking up on (112:40 - 112:45)
um so that was kind of cool yeah like (112:42 - 112:46)
the pokemon doesn't notice this (112:45 - 112:48)
mysterious cloud that just appeared on (112:46 - 112:52)
the ground that's walking around okay (112:48 - 112:54)
all right uh accuracy it reduces your (112:52 - 112:56)
accuracy drainage as this does (112:54 - 113:00)
it just reduces your accuracy (112:56 - 113:00)
and a possibility that it doesn't move (113:00 - 113:05)
it use a move at all (113:02 - 113:05)
i like it i like the change and i think (113:08 - 113:11)
it's interesting i wonder whether (113:10 - 113:13)
they're i wonder whether they're using (113:11 - 113:14)
this to see whether it's popular and (113:13 - 113:16)
then decide whether they're going to (113:14 - 113:19)
move forward with it or not yeah or just (113:16 - 113:20)
future balance stuff as we've learned (113:19 - 113:23)
from pokemon like talonflame where their (113:20 - 113:25)
ability was just (113:23 - 113:29)
incredibly way too good uh (113:25 - 113:29)
um there are other pokemon abilities (113:30 - 113:34)
they had to change because they were way (113:32 - 113:36)
too good too but (113:34 - 113:37)
but that's that's all competitive stuff (113:36 - 113:39)
like somebody going through would like (113:37 - 113:41)
there's nowhere where the game is like (113:39 - 113:42)
hey if you have an ability called (113:41 - 113:46)
prankster and your pokemon is dark and (113:42 - 113:47)
you decide to use a move that would be (113:46 - 113:49)
effective like prankster like dark and (113:47 - 113:51)
but you decide to use that on another (113:49 - 113:54)
dark type pokemon that doesn't work like (113:51 - 113:57)
nowhere in the history of all of (113:54 - 113:59)
pokemonder are they like hey a dark type (113:57 - 114:01)
prankster pokemon can't use a prankster (113:59 - 114:02)
move against another dark type pokemon (114:01 - 114:05)
it will fail (114:02 - 114:06)
yeah (114:05 - 114:07)
there's one other thing we missed uh we (114:06 - 114:11)
didn't talk about the final ride pokemon (114:07 - 114:13)
uh oh yeah your favorite (114:11 - 114:17)
uh ursuluna yeah yeah yeah is ursa luna (114:13 - 114:20)
just replacing weird deer or is it i (114:17 - 114:22)
believe it can find items as well it can (114:20 - 114:24)
like oh it's like (114:22 - 114:26)
yeah (114:24 - 114:27)
got it (114:26 - 114:29)
so yeah so you have weird deer for (114:27 - 114:30)
movement (114:29 - 114:33)
you have sneezler to climb you have (114:30 - 114:35)
bravery to fly (114:33 - 114:37)
you have basket legion for water and (114:35 - 114:40)
then you have ursulina for (114:37 - 114:41)
item finder (114:40 - 114:43)
honey (114:41 - 114:45)
which is pretty much the same as sun and (114:43 - 114:48)
moon kind of (114:45 - 114:48)
tauros to move scotland to dig (114:49 - 114:57)
mudsdale to get over rocky terrain (114:53 - 114:59)
yes sharpie i guess that's kind of the (114:57 - 115:01)
same it's not exactly the same was it (114:59 - 115:03)
not uh whether or not to surf pokemon (115:01 - 115:05)
was there not lapras in that one as well (115:03 - 115:06)
oh yeah there was lapras and there was (115:05 - 115:10)
torpedo sharpie you could go faster but (115:06 - 115:12)
something happened (115:10 - 115:13)
you couldn't fish off it it was faster (115:12 - 115:15)
but you can fish off it lapras you could (115:13 - 115:17)
fish off you could fish off lapras oh (115:15 - 115:19)
yeah cause you could surf up to like a (115:17 - 115:20)
little watering hole and then it would (115:19 - 115:21)
say press a to fish (115:20 - 115:23)
you can tell i've never really fished in (115:21 - 115:25)
pokemon games very much yeah you're not (115:23 - 115:26)
missing much (115:25 - 115:27)
we don't or is there fishing in this (115:26 - 115:29)
game (115:27 - 115:31)
clearly there's no breeding because (115:29 - 115:33)
there's fish (115:31 - 115:35)
so oh here's one thing that we had (115:33 - 115:36)
discussed uh as to whether it was a (115:35 - 115:38)
possibility so we saw that you can catch (115:36 - 115:41)
pokemon on while uh when on uh weird (115:38 - 115:43)
deer yeah so and on basket legion we saw (115:41 - 115:45)
it ages ago but there was a discussion (115:43 - 115:46)
as to whether you'd be able to do it on (115:45 - 115:49)
brave area or not you can (115:46 - 115:51)
you can even catch pokemon that are (115:49 - 115:53)
flying from the ground (115:51 - 115:56)
oh crazy oh geez (115:53 - 115:57)
including some pokemon you might not (115:56 - 115:58)
expect to see up there but it makes (115:57 - 115:59)
sense (115:58 - 116:02)
the that's all i'll say (115:59 - 116:05)
the like (116:02 - 116:05)
handful of leaks that we talked about (116:05 - 116:09)
which isn't even a lot honestly we (116:07 - 116:10)
talked about pokeballs we talked about (116:09 - 116:12)
like some features missing we talked (116:10 - 116:13)
about some features added and then we (116:12 - 116:15)
talked about 20 new pokemon like we (116:13 - 116:17)
didn't really talk about that much of (116:15 - 116:19)
the game (116:17 - 116:21)
but i think it still brings me back to (116:19 - 116:23)
how we open this conversation of like i (116:21 - 116:25)
think they've done a bad job marketing (116:23 - 116:28)
this (116:25 - 116:30)
well get your marketing degree and and (116:28 - 116:32)
go apply (116:30 - 116:33)
yeah (116:32 - 116:35)
it depends whether you think the leaks (116:33 - 116:38)
were coordinated or not (116:35 - 116:40)
no (116:38 - 116:41)
i don't (116:40 - 116:43)
well they didn't give me a copy so (116:41 - 116:44)
clearly not (116:43 - 116:46)
we'll never know we will literally never (116:44 - 116:48)
know because it's the same you know (116:46 - 116:50)
people have the same argument about like (116:48 - 116:52)
you know technology releases whether you (116:50 - 116:56)
know apple gets people into things (116:52 - 116:57)
and you know whether they do that about (116:56 - 116:59)
the you know whether stuff was leaked (116:57 - 117:00)
about the spider-man films deliberately (116:59 - 117:02)
or not we'll never know but it's an (117:00 - 117:03)
interesting thing to think about (117:02 - 117:06)
it's like it just reminds me but i i (117:03 - 117:07)
just can't stop thinking about that (117:06 - 117:09)
13-minute gameplay trailer where they're (117:07 - 117:11)
actually don't show any gameplay i know (117:09 - 117:14)
well the ultimate test the ultimate (117:11 - 117:17)
proof is how much does it sell (117:14 - 117:19)
right that that is the proof of a (117:17 - 117:21)
marketing campaign dollars i think this (117:19 - 117:24)
pokemon game is that game like this is i (117:21 - 117:26)
don't think people were waiting for (117:24 - 117:28)
reviews for brilliant diamond shining (117:26 - 117:30)
pearl right you think like this is this (117:28 - 117:32)
is a i know what this is this is a (117:30 - 117:34)
remade pokemon game i love i grew i (117:32 - 117:36)
you're either in two camps i grew up (117:34 - 117:38)
with diamond and pearl or i played it i (117:36 - 117:40)
want to play it again or i this was the (117:38 - 117:41)
generation i skipped so now i'm going to (117:40 - 117:45)
actually experience it like yeah (117:41 - 117:47)
and and i i have talked to a handful of (117:45 - 117:49)
people obviously it's very small market (117:47 - 117:51)
share of my own twitch chat being like (117:49 - 117:53)
i kind of regret this is the first time (117:51 - 117:54)
i regret getting both versions because i (117:53 - 117:56)
play through one and i have zero desire (117:54 - 117:58)
to play through another because (117:56 - 118:00)
i think diamond and pearl are not great (117:58 - 118:04)
remakes i think they're kind of bad (118:00 - 118:07)
unless you specifically like very (118:04 - 118:09)
old-school grindy pokemon games i i'm (118:07 - 118:11)
those people exist obviously they (118:09 - 118:14)
they're the ones like (118:11 - 118:14)
um (118:14 - 118:18)
and i think there was some hesitation (118:16 - 118:20)
with sword and shield and i think that (118:18 - 118:23)
was just because of how vocal a small (118:20 - 118:25)
minority of people were of like look at (118:23 - 118:28)
how bad this game is not all the pokemon (118:25 - 118:29)
which we haven't even heard for that (118:28 - 118:31)
like no one is really talking about that (118:29 - 118:33)
for legends like not only does this game (118:31 - 118:35)
not have all the pokemon it has half the (118:33 - 118:38)
pokedex of sword and shield (118:35 - 118:39)
yeah less than they're definitely (118:38 - 118:40)
they're definitely some people (118:39 - 118:42)
complaining about it but it's not to any (118:40 - 118:44)
weight level as much as it was with (118:42 - 118:45)
sword and shield (118:44 - 118:47)
um (118:45 - 118:49)
but i just the 13 minutes of gameplay (118:47 - 118:50)
and they didn't even show a start to (118:49 - 118:52)
finish of a battle and that's like (118:50 - 118:54)
literally all i needed to be like i am (118:52 - 118:56)
now soldier you did it this is what i (118:54 - 118:58)
needed i watched you walk into a battle (118:56 - 119:00)
and leave a battle and that looked (118:58 - 119:01)
incredible (119:00 - 119:03)
i would like more of this (119:01 - 119:05)
yeah like the game looks awesome it it (119:03 - 119:08)
it genuinely it looks graphically better (119:05 - 119:09)
it looks (119:08 - 119:11)
like there's actually a lot to do the (119:09 - 119:14)
pokedex yeah seems a little bit tiny but (119:11 - 119:15)
because there are alpha pokemon because (119:14 - 119:17)
there are different size pokemon because (119:15 - 119:19)
like (119:17 - 119:20)
it seems more than enough to what (119:19 - 119:22)
they're doing (119:20 - 119:24)
and yeah it's like a bummer there's no (119:22 - 119:26)
held items there's a bummer there's no (119:24 - 119:28)
abilities but like at the same time the (119:26 - 119:30)
same as let's go pikachu let's gravy hey (119:28 - 119:32)
this is more of a collecting game not a (119:30 - 119:33)
competitive battle game (119:32 - 119:36)
um (119:33 - 119:36)
and it's been it's been a while since (119:37 - 119:39)
you've had a pokemon game where there's (119:38 - 119:41)
a uh you know an actual story that you (119:39 - 119:43)
didn't already know like sergeant shield (119:41 - 119:44)
was the last time that there was a story (119:43 - 119:45)
you could play through (119:44 - 119:47)
yeah that's true i mean let's go was (119:45 - 119:49)
like it was nice that they mixed up the (119:47 - 119:50)
story (119:49 - 119:52)
and it was like cool that like that dude (119:50 - 119:54)
gets like the marowak at the end it was (119:52 - 119:55)
like very cute (119:54 - 119:57)
that they like did that little story (119:55 - 120:00)
beat but yeah (119:57 - 120:00)
i don't know looking at that palkia (120:00 - 120:03)
dialga (120:02 - 120:05)
there's something story related (120:03 - 120:08)
oh yes i'm so excited to hear to see (120:05 - 120:11)
people experience it (120:08 - 120:11)
but yeah i i (120:11 - 120:15)
i think this is that one pokemon game (120:13 - 120:17)
where people are legit waiting for (120:15 - 120:19)
reviews or legit waiting for somebody to (120:17 - 120:21)
play on twitch and i think if you're in (120:19 - 120:22)
the camp of me where you're (120:21 - 120:24)
optimistically excited and you're like (120:22 - 120:26)
uh i don't know is this going to be like (120:24 - 120:27)
more of a gale of darkness is it going (120:26 - 120:29)
to be more like a sword and shield this (120:27 - 120:30)
is going to be more like a let's go i (120:29 - 120:32)
think if if you genuinely like pokemon (120:30 - 120:34)
and you watch somebody play this for 20 (120:32 - 120:37)
minutes you are probably going to buy it (120:34 - 120:38)
because i saw a handful of people being (120:37 - 120:40)
like oh this is two monster hunter for (120:38 - 120:41)
me (120:40 - 120:42)
and i understand we talked about how it (120:41 - 120:44)
looked monster hunter referred me but (120:42 - 120:45)
once i saw people play it i was like oh (120:44 - 120:48)
this is a pokemon game like this is not (120:45 - 120:50)
monster hunter this is pokemon (120:48 - 120:52)
yeah i don't think (120:50 - 120:53)
it's not going to sell as well certain (120:52 - 120:55)
to you it's not going to be (120:53 - 120:57)
anywhere near that yeah um but i think (120:55 - 120:59)
it will do better than basically every (120:57 - 121:01)
remake (120:59 - 121:03)
i think it's going to sell like like a (121:01 - 121:05)
new generation does just not like the (121:03 - 121:07)
bet the best-selling ones that that (121:05 - 121:09)
makes sense because people who just (121:07 - 121:11)
absolutely want the gym (121:09 - 121:12)
life (121:11 - 121:13)
they're they're not going to go in for (121:12 - 121:15)
this no matter what this could be the (121:13 - 121:17)
greatest pokemon game ever but they're (121:15 - 121:19)
just like i want the gym story (121:17 - 121:21)
yeah someone like my my nephew who has (121:19 - 121:22)
sword and shield and has let's go (121:21 - 121:24)
pikachu he he's not going to play this (121:22 - 121:27)
game right because it's it's not what (121:24 - 121:29)
he's looking for but (121:27 - 121:32)
you know basically any like (121:29 - 121:33)
no i'm not going to say the word proper (121:32 - 121:34)
fan but you know what i mean like a (121:33 - 121:36)
hardcore fan rather than just like i (121:34 - 121:38)
like to play some pokemon games i think (121:36 - 121:40)
anyone who's been looking for something (121:38 - 121:41)
interesting and looking for something (121:40 - 121:44)
new they will surely buy this because (121:41 - 121:47)
this is what they were asking for (121:44 - 121:48)
yeah (121:47 - 121:51)
i i i think there will be some people (121:48 - 121:53)
that walk away being like oh it wasn't (121:51 - 121:55)
breath of the wild (121:53 - 121:56)
and it's like (121:55 - 121:58)
you you are you have set your own (121:56 - 122:01)
expectations for that (121:58 - 122:02)
um and i think i think i think it's (122:01 - 122:04)
pretty confirmed the game is not open (122:02 - 122:07)
world like it is broken in two sections (122:04 - 122:08)
yeah what do they call that open area is (122:07 - 122:10)
that the terminal i like to use yeah (122:08 - 122:12)
like like the while there are three wild (122:10 - 122:14)
areas you can't travel but (122:12 - 122:15)
yeah sure (122:14 - 122:17)
but like three while there isn't (122:15 - 122:18)
everything else is everything else is (122:17 - 122:21)
the same as an open world game it's just (122:18 - 122:23)
like it's like a lot of smaller open (122:21 - 122:24)
world games because (122:23 - 122:26)
the thing that i always think about open (122:24 - 122:28)
world games is not necessarily about the (122:26 - 122:29)
fact that you can walk from one end of (122:28 - 122:30)
the map to the other because whoever (122:29 - 122:31)
does that (122:30 - 122:34)
but it's more about the fact that (122:31 - 122:37)
it's the not having the (122:34 - 122:39)
separate world for battles you're just (122:37 - 122:40)
battling in the overworld then you can (122:39 - 122:43)
just explore how you like and go up (122:40 - 122:45)
these random hills and that sort of (122:43 - 122:47)
stuff so it has all the same gameplay (122:45 - 122:50)
elements as an open world game (122:47 - 122:52)
yeah yeah (122:50 - 122:53)
yeah i think i don't know in my head (122:52 - 122:55)
open world is (122:53 - 122:57)
you can go anywhere you want (122:55 - 122:59)
at any time at any time well like in (122:57 - 123:01)
breath of the wild you have to do the (122:59 - 123:03)
20-minute tutorial before you can do (123:01 - 123:04)
that (123:03 - 123:06)
in this game it seems like you can't go (123:04 - 123:08)
to any of those areas until you hit the (123:06 - 123:09)
story beat (123:08 - 123:11)
but once you hit that story beat (123:09 - 123:14)
now area 2 is open and at any point you (123:11 - 123:15)
go back to area one and then once you (123:14 - 123:17)
finish the area beat for story it seems (123:15 - 123:20)
very much like the what the not the (123:17 - 123:21)
elders the (123:20 - 123:23)
not the alpha pokemon the (123:21 - 123:26)
totem pokemon oh the cleaver whatever (123:23 - 123:29)
that's called whatever cleaver is oh (123:26 - 123:32)
what are they lords no (123:29 - 123:34)
noble noble nobles no it seems like the (123:32 - 123:37)
like you once you beat noble pokemon (123:34 - 123:40)
next area for you to explore opens up (123:37 - 123:42)
which in my head is not not really an (123:40 - 123:43)
open world game yeah it's because (123:42 - 123:46)
there's still a gating system yeah and (123:43 - 123:47)
and it isn't i'm not saying it is and i (123:46 - 123:49)
absolutely get that that is technically (123:47 - 123:51)
the definition of an open world but it's (123:49 - 123:53)
just like you know for for me that's not (123:51 - 123:55)
really the big thing about open world (123:53 - 123:57)
games and i really couldn't actually (123:55 - 123:59)
care about that yeah i don't know (123:57 - 124:02)
it's all of the other (123:59 - 124:02)
i just want to gameplay in this (124:09 - 124:14)
direction and hope for the best (124:10 - 124:14)
and i and you do that once or twice and (124:14 - 124:17)
you're like yeah (124:16 - 124:19)
all right i guess i should go back to (124:17 - 124:20)
the story (124:19 - 124:21)
yeah i i'm sure there are some people (124:20 - 124:24)
that like they they did the first story (124:21 - 124:25)
beat and then they just did try shrine (124:24 - 124:27)
after shrine after shrine after because (124:25 - 124:28)
you could (124:27 - 124:30)
um yeah and then eventually got back to (124:28 - 124:31)
the story (124:30 - 124:34)
uh but yeah in this game it seems like (124:31 - 124:35)
you want to see the whole map you're (124:34 - 124:36)
gonna have to keep hitting those story (124:35 - 124:38)
beats which is to me it's okay (124:36 - 124:41)
and there are advantages to to that kind (124:38 - 124:42)
of game because the problem with a fully (124:41 - 124:44)
open world game like breath of the wild (124:42 - 124:46)
is your story ends up being kind of (124:44 - 124:47)
boring (124:46 - 124:49)
because you can't you have to be able to (124:47 - 124:50)
there's like four (124:49 - 124:53)
five big things in the game and they all (124:50 - 124:55)
have to make sense in whatever order you (124:53 - 124:56)
do them (124:55 - 124:57)
yeah (124:56 - 124:59)
you don't need to do that in this if (124:57 - 125:00)
you've got an open world game an open (124:59 - 125:02)
area game you can do the same (125:00 - 125:03)
everything else the same it's just your (125:02 - 125:07)
story can be slightly more linear (125:03 - 125:09)
and that's what also bothered me is (125:07 - 125:10)
people just like (125:09 - 125:12)
there's like the stigma that open world (125:10 - 125:15)
games are like the the the gold star of (125:12 - 125:17)
video games and it's like i played final (125:15 - 125:19)
fantasy 15. loved final fantasy xv (125:17 - 125:22)
that's an open world game (125:19 - 125:26)
that open world is so incredibly boring (125:22 - 125:28)
and i got to like the three hours in the (125:26 - 125:29)
game and i was like i'm gonna do the (125:28 - 125:30)
breath of the wild thing i'm gonna go in (125:29 - 125:32)
the direction we're just gonna walk (125:30 - 125:34)
we're gonna see what's out there there (125:32 - 125:35)
ain't nothing out there (125:34 - 125:37)
i i i just get in the car did you drive (125:35 - 125:40)
a car two hours walking i battled some (125:37 - 125:43)
weird giant snake thing i got a ring (125:40 - 125:45)
and i was like sweet cool i got this (125:43 - 125:46)
really cool ring i walked all the way (125:45 - 125:48)
back to like the store and then i (125:46 - 125:49)
realized they sold that same ring in the (125:48 - 125:50)
store (125:49 - 125:52)
and i was like i thought i got a unique (125:50 - 125:55)
ring for two hours of my (125:52 - 125:56)
and i (125:55 - 125:58)
i at that point i was like i don't want (125:56 - 125:59)
to play this game anymore because the (125:58 - 126:01)
open world was so bad and it felt like (125:59 - 126:03)
it disrespected my time (126:01 - 126:05)
and i then proceeded to play the rest of (126:03 - 126:07)
final fantasy 15 (126:05 - 126:09)
ignoring everything open world and just (126:07 - 126:11)
going story beat to story beat and i was (126:09 - 126:12)
like this is a great game loved it i (126:11 - 126:14)
have zero desire to explore whatever you (126:12 - 126:15)
put out there because you didn't put (126:14 - 126:17)
anything out there (126:15 - 126:19)
um (126:17 - 126:19)
and (126:20 - 126:23)
i i think the isle of armor and i think (126:21 - 126:26)
the crown tundra (126:23 - 126:28)
they're open world in the sense right (126:26 - 126:29)
there's no trainer battles out there (126:28 - 126:31)
there's a bunch of pokemon you can catch (126:29 - 126:32)
and explore and do all that stuff and i (126:31 - 126:35)
think that's a and it's fun to explore (126:32 - 126:37)
that stuff i think the isle of armor is (126:35 - 126:39)
a better open world area than the crown (126:37 - 126:40)
tundra (126:39 - 126:42)
and i only think that is because like (126:40 - 126:45)
it's like a better circle where crown (126:42 - 126:47)
tundra is like a square and like there's (126:45 - 126:48)
kind of just you just kind of hit dead (126:47 - 126:50)
ends and you're like you can't lose that (126:48 - 126:50)
well (126:50 - 126:53)
i also find that the crown tundra just (126:50 - 126:54)
it looks samey (126:53 - 126:56)
like i don't think any of the areas (126:54 - 126:58)
really look unique whereas in the isle (126:56 - 127:01)
of armor each corner of it feels very (126:58 - 127:03)
different to the last (127:01 - 127:05)
yeah like the swamp area in the center (127:03 - 127:07)
to the connected of the forest connected (127:05 - 127:08)
to the mountain connected to like the (127:07 - 127:10)
beach exactly i agree whereas crown (127:08 - 127:12)
tundra is like hey have you heard of (127:10 - 127:14)
snow (127:12 - 127:16)
well there's snow and there's graveyard (127:14 - 127:17)
and then like (127:16 - 127:19)
the graveyard the graveyard is (127:17 - 127:21)
interesting right i'll give you that (127:19 - 127:23)
that and there's a little bit where you (127:21 - 127:25)
get kelly oh that's kind of interesting (127:23 - 127:26)
but everything else is just the snow (127:25 - 127:30)
just different places of snow (127:26 - 127:30)
ah (127:31 - 127:34)
i feel (127:32 - 127:35)
so much better after looking at the (127:34 - 127:37)
leaks i'm so excited for this game i was (127:35 - 127:39)
excited for this game but now i'm like (127:37 - 127:40)
actually excited for this game (127:39 - 127:41)
where (127:40 - 127:43)
i want it now (127:41 - 127:46)
you sound like somebody from tick-tock (127:43 - 127:47)
how do you feel about looking at the (127:46 - 127:48)
leaks well (127:47 - 127:50)
i mean i was always excited (127:48 - 127:53)
i i think it's gonna be a lot of fun (127:50 - 127:55)
i i find like the what the leaks are (127:53 - 127:57)
suggesting to (127:55 - 127:59)
that it's interesting right i'm looking (127:57 - 128:01)
forward to now exploring how these (127:59 - 128:03)
mechanics will play out (128:01 - 128:06)
uh but i was always excited so yeah (128:03 - 128:08)
definitely (128:06 - 128:09)
al what are you feeling after these (128:08 - 128:10)
leaks (128:09 - 128:13)
yeah i was to some degree excited (128:10 - 128:14)
because i knew it was going to be (128:13 - 128:16)
different and and that was exciting to (128:14 - 128:20)
me i was always a little bit uh nervous (128:16 - 128:21)
not because i didn't think it would be (128:20 - 128:22)
good but because i didn't think i would (128:21 - 128:24)
enjoy it i was like i'm not sure whether (128:22 - 128:26)
this is going to be my kind of game or (128:24 - 128:27)
not (128:26 - 128:29)
um after after seeing the leaks i'm like (128:27 - 128:31)
no this is my game right i think i'm (128:29 - 128:33)
gonna sink loads of time into this are (128:31 - 128:35)
there berries can you plant bear and (128:33 - 128:37)
grow berries (128:35 - 128:38)
i don't think you can plant them i think (128:37 - 128:40)
it's like sword and shield where there's (128:38 - 128:42)
just the trees and you throw your (128:40 - 128:45)
pokemon at it in the house (128:42 - 128:45)
it's no x and y you know we're still (128:45 - 128:49)
waiting for that x and y again (128:48 - 128:51)
um we don't know if there's any ribbons (128:49 - 128:53)
or marks no one cares enough to data (128:51 - 128:56)
mine that for us (128:53 - 128:56)
do i get an arceus ribbon for saving the (128:58 - 129:03)
world is that (129:01 - 129:06)
no i'm assuming there's no elite four (129:03 - 129:08)
since this was before the time of (129:06 - 129:10)
whatever uh (129:08 - 129:11)
but i guess i guess we'll find out when (129:10 - 129:12)
we play (129:11 - 129:14)
um (129:12 - 129:15)
you know i'm going to be real honest i (129:14 - 129:17)
don't know what the structures of this (129:15 - 129:18)
mini series is going to be i'm going to (129:17 - 129:19)
just say we're going to have a normal (129:18 - 129:22)
episode next week uh (129:19 - 129:23)
probably the same thing though you know (129:22 - 129:24)
the game will be out we'll probably (129:23 - 129:27)
freely talk about our experiences early (129:24 - 129:29)
on in the game i (129:27 - 129:31)
probably avoid story stuff for people (129:29 - 129:33)
and then we'll do like the two-week rule (129:31 - 129:34)
like hey if you haven't bought this game (129:33 - 129:37)
in the first two weeks (129:34 - 129:38)
probably don't care about story that's (129:37 - 129:40)
like the movie role right like hey if (129:38 - 129:41)
you didn't see spider-man the first two (129:40 - 129:42)
weeks what are you what are you waiting (129:41 - 129:44)
