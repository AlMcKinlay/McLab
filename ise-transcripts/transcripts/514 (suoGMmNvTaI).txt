is that person pick the ula ula path (8:00 - 8:05)
um if you want star pieces and (8:03 - 8:08)
a rocker radar pick the pony island (8:05 - 8:10)
i i think i'm going to go mellow melee i (8:08 - 8:11)
think the four lucky eggs is probably (8:10 - 8:14)
worth it to me (8:11 - 8:15)
i never use (8:14 - 8:17)
i never use any of this (8:15 - 8:18)
same (8:17 - 8:20)
well then you pick a based off hat (8:18 - 8:23)
which hat do you want the best (8:20 - 8:26)
the ballet hat (8:23 - 8:27)
yeah i mean (8:26 - 8:30)
the scentsy style hat (8:27 - 8:32)
is good (8:30 - 8:33)
like that's the (8:32 - 8:36)
best one of them yes but i mean that's (8:33 - 8:37)
the best (8:36 - 8:40)
of them oh absolutely but i also would (8:37 - 8:43)
use an incense and incubators more that (8:40 - 8:45)
i would use (8:43 - 8:48)
rocket radar a premium raid pass and (8:45 - 8:50)
three star pieces and i definitely don't (8:48 - 8:53)
need a lowland executor (8:50 - 8:56)
i mean (8:53 - 8:56)
none of these are none of these are like (8:58 - 9:05)
yeah that's my path because they're all (9:01 - 9:07)
well ideally it shouldn't be that big of (9:05 - 9:09)
a deal because it should be free so if (9:07 - 9:11)
like you did the things that they want (9:09 - 9:14)
you to do (9:11 - 9:14)
so (9:15 - 9:18)
i mean i probably have to go a college (9:16 - 9:20)
just to perhaps get another shiny alolan (9:18 - 9:23)
marowak like i don't (9:20 - 9:25)
yeah you get the incubators you use (9:23 - 9:27)
those (9:25 - 9:29)
i would use though i would use the (9:27 - 9:31)
incubators eventually and i would use (9:29 - 9:34)
the incense eventually (9:31 - 9:35)
speaking of money (9:34 - 9:37)

for participating in local raids and (14:48 - 14:53)
changes to the in-game item shop (14:50 - 14:55)
the new social features some which are (14:53 - 14:57)
based in a separate niantic app have (14:55 - 15:00)
been tested over time and will be (14:57 - 15:02)
available in pokemon go sometime in the (15:00 - 15:05)
next few months i'm assuming (15:02 - 15:07)
sorry i want to stop this press release (15:05 - 15:09)
i'm assuming that they're that (15:07 - 15:12)
they're talking about ingress yes you (15:09 - 15:14)
can and they're not allowed to say it (15:12 - 15:16)
because i am betting the pokemon company (15:14 - 15:18)
is like do not mention your other games (15:16 - 15:19)
in art wow (15:18 - 15:22)
they they link new social features in (15:19 - 15:24)
this press release on their page and you (15:22 - 15:26)
click on it and it goes niantic launches (15:24 - 15:29)
social app experience in closed beta to (15:26 - 15:31)
select ingress ancients like it's not (15:29 - 15:33)
it's not like (15:31 - 15:34)
it's not even like a trail of (15:33 - 15:36)
breadcrumbs it's literally two (15:34 - 15:38)
breadcrumbs and you're at you're at the (15:36 - 15:41)
goal why can't they just say ingress why (15:38 - 15:44)
why does it have to be a link (15:41 - 15:44)
whatever (15:46 - 15:49)
um (15:48 - 15:51)
our hopes is that these features will (15:49 - 15:52)
make it easier for trainers to (15:51 - 15:54)
communicate with each other discover new (15:52 - 15:57)
communities and enjoy a local (15:54 - 15:59)
enjoy local raid battles (15:57 - 16:01)
we know that this feature is much needed (15:59 - 16:03)
and we look forward to making the social (16:01 - 16:05)
experiment experiments and that's what (16:03 - 16:08)
the word should be (16:05 - 16:08)
even better over time (16:10 - 16:14)
as of this month (16:12 - 16:17)
mega energy and rare candy xl are (16:14 - 16:20)
available as as rewards for completing (16:17 - 16:23)
local raid battles making it easier to (16:20 - 16:25)
evolve and strengthen your pokemon also (16:23 - 16:29)
starting in may 20th on may 23rd (16:25 - 16:32)
the one pokecoin event box will no (16:29 - 16:35)
longer include remote raid passes and (16:32 - 16:38)
will instead feature a rotating array of (16:35 - 16:39)
items (16:38 - 16:42)
trainers all over the world have helped (16:39 - 16:45)
okay the the last part is like oh (16:42 - 16:46)
actually the last part doesn't matter to (16:45 - 16:48)
support players who have difficulty (16:46 - 16:50)
reaching gyms we will continue to work (16:48 - 16:53)
on solutions such as tools for community (16:50 - 16:56)
leaders to organize local events and (16:53 - 16:57)
faster (16:56 - 17:00)
approval for new gyms we look forward to (16:57 - 17:02)
adventuring together in person pokemon (17:00 - 17:04)
go team (17:02 - 17:06)
so that means scan all those things the (17:04 - 17:09)
gyms they can be removed the bad ones (17:06 - 17:11)
can be removed and the scanning does not (17:09 - 17:12)
remove gyms (17:11 - 17:14)
has clarified this (17:12 - 17:16)
no that's what they sure they cannot be (17:14 - 17:19)
trusted they literally cannot be trusted (17:16 - 17:21)
because they left things out of this (17:19 - 17:23)
press release (17:21 - 17:23)
um (17:25 - 17:27)
okay (17:28 - 17:30)
so (17:29 - 17:32)
we talked about this two or three weeks (17:30 - 17:36)
ago that if niantic wants me to walk to (17:32 - 17:38)
a rock roof and spend 20 minutes (17:36 - 17:40)
10 minutes to walk to the rock ruff do (17:38 - 17:43)
the rock rough come back (17:40 - 17:46)
versus i'll just spend the dollar (17:43 - 17:48)
i'll get the same thing (17:46 - 17:51)
but i'll save 20 minutes (17:48 - 17:53)
now this is a different argument than (17:51 - 17:55)
somebody who's like hey i'm gonna spend (17:53 - 17:57)
90 minutes to play go today and then go (17:55 - 17:58)
out and play go (17:57 - 18:00)
i'm talking about the situation where (17:58 - 18:01)
like (18:00 - 18:04)
i don't have a lot of time i may be like (18:01 - 18:06)
on my lunch break (18:04 - 18:10)
um it maybe it's raining out (18:06 - 18:12)
obviously like (18:10 - 18:13)
there's there's differences in that (18:12 - 18:16)
situation like i i i try to fit (18:13 - 18:19)
personally an hour of go in a day (18:16 - 18:20)
and that's mostly just walking yeah (18:19 - 18:22)
that's a lot well i'm also playing (18:20 - 18:24)
pikmin (18:22 - 18:27)
good heavens i like walking (18:24 - 18:30)
don't i walk too i'm not i'm not playing (18:27 - 18:32)
go for the entire time i mean i mean (18:30 - 18:33)
like look you just get the pokeball plus (18:32 - 18:35)
going you press the button and you read (18:33 - 18:37)
twitter is that playing go that's in the (18:35 - 18:38)
button (18:37 - 18:41)
because what i do is i i open up go and (18:38 - 18:42)
i go oh there's like a gym over here (18:41 - 18:44)
that i can put a pokemon in there's (18:42 - 18:46)
that's what i'm gonna walk to and then i (18:44 - 18:47)
walk to there and then i open it up (18:46 - 18:49)
again i'm like oh i'm gonna walk to this (18:47 - 18:51)
gym next (18:49 - 18:52)
we have different we have different (18:51 - 18:55)
definitions of what playing is at this (18:52 - 18:58)
point because walking with the apt (18:55 - 18:59)
closed isn't (18:58 - 19:02)
it that's the way i play i'm not walking (18:59 - 19:04)
with it i'm not i don't have pokemon go (19:02 - 19:05)
open (19:04 - 19:08)
the entire time like i catch the two (19:05 - 19:10)
pokemon or i'm like all these pokemon (19:08 - 19:11)
are garbage i'll let the pokeball plus (19:10 - 19:14)
clean up and then i'll check twitter or (19:11 - 19:16)
text and then just too much work too (19:14 - 19:17)
much work (19:16 - 19:19)
look i don't want to look at nature i (19:17 - 19:22)
just want to walk through it (19:19 - 19:22)
uh they okay so mega energy and rare xl (19:23 - 19:29)
rare candy xl will be available for (19:26 - 19:31)
rewards for completing local raid (19:29 - 19:33)
battles i think this is a great step (19:31 - 19:36)
yes so if instead so i can spend the (19:33 - 19:37)
dollar (19:36 - 19:40)
to remote rate into rock ruff (19:37 - 19:42)
and i can get i can get my 20 minutes (19:40 - 19:43)
back (19:42 - 19:45)
or i can say well the rock rough is free (19:43 - 19:47)
if i can walk to it because i get the (19:45 - 19:49)
free raid pass but also i'm going to get (19:47 - 19:51)
xl candy (19:49 - 19:53)
there's maybe an asterisk there of how (19:51 - 19:55)
much that's gonna drop if it's like zero (19:53 - 19:57)
to one or zero to five (19:55 - 20:00)
um and i'm gonna give mega candy (19:57 - 20:02)
so is it worth me (20:00 - 20:03)
walking there now (20:02 - 20:06)
yeah maybe i guess we'll have to wait (20:03 - 20:07)
and see yeah i mean i mean everyone (20:06 - 20:09)
freaked out that like niantic said hey (20:07 - 20:10)
we're (20:09 - 20:11)
slight i'm pretty sure there are exact (20:10 - 20:13)
words where we're slightly nerfing rare (20:11 - 20:15)
candy and raids and then it was like (20:13 - 20:16)
they (20:15 - 20:18)
like no one noticed a difference i (20:16 - 20:20)
actually don't even know why they said (20:18 - 20:20)
it (20:20 - 20:22)
i mean (20:20 - 20:23)
people got themselves somebody would (20:22 - 20:25)
have noticed apparent there but not (20:23 - 20:27)
transparent about this one (20:25 - 20:30)
yeah so the the transparency is they um (20:27 - 20:32)
well they did say we're removing the one (20:30 - 20:34)
coin box they no longer included remote (20:32 - 20:36)
raid passes (20:34 - 20:38)
and then they they got rid of the (20:36 - 20:40)
discounted (20:38 - 20:41)
um (20:40 - 20:42)
remote (20:41 - 20:46)
raid savings so a remote raid pass is (20:42 - 20:48)
100 coins which is actually a discounted (20:46 - 20:51)
price it's not supposed to be 100 coins (20:48 - 20:53)
and then the the remote raid pass bundle (20:51 - 20:55)
was 250 so you're saving 50 cents and (20:53 - 20:57)
they changed that to three dollars so (20:55 - 20:59)
they they hiked the price up 50 well (20:57 - 21:03)
they just got rid of they got rid of (20:59 - 21:06)
like any reason to buy three because (21:03 - 21:07)
they know (21:06 - 21:08)
buying one three times there's no (21:07 - 21:10)
discount yeah (21:08 - 21:12)
for no (21:10 - 21:12)
reason (21:12 - 21:15)
other than (21:12 - 21:15)
dissuade people from buying remote raid (21:15 - 21:19)
passes and have the in-person experience (21:17 - 21:20)
instead (21:19 - 21:22)
i mean just get rid of i guess that's (21:20 - 21:23)
the reason what will say just get rid of (21:22 - 21:25)
the three get rid of the three bundle (21:23 - 21:27)
then because it's (21:25 - 21:31)
oh but then i have to hit by three times (21:27 - 21:34)
if you want people to not (21:31 - 21:37)
purchase rate passes make it more (21:34 - 21:39)
difficult to do so like changing it to (21:37 - 21:41)
300 but still offering a bundle of three (21:39 - 21:43)
is a total mixed message of what you're (21:41 - 21:45)
trying to do but it still costs (21:43 - 21:47)
more it's just saving you a few clicks (21:45 - 21:50)
if if their goal which doesn't cost more (21:47 - 21:52)
it's the same cost it's the same cost (21:50 - 21:54)
what no it costs more than 250 for three (21:52 - 21:55)
oh yeah yeah (21:54 - 21:57)
if your goal is to stop people from (21:55 - 22:00)
using remote raid passes as much which (21:57 - 22:02)
they are then get rid of the bundle (22:00 - 22:04)
completely because it's not a price (22:02 - 22:06)
savings (22:04 - 22:07)
and you're just making it easier for (22:06 - 22:09)
people to buy three which is the action (22:07 - 22:13)
that you don't want them to take (22:09 - 22:16)
i was going to say is make them buy it (22:13 - 22:17)
three times in a row because people are (22:16 - 22:19)
going to be frustrated by that (22:17 - 22:21)
experience because they can't buy it in (22:19 - 22:23)
bulk and (22:21 - 22:25)
rely rest rely less on remote rate (22:23 - 22:28)
passes i think the cost is more of an (22:25 - 22:29)
issue than the number of clicks as a (22:28 - 22:31)
disincentive (22:29 - 22:33)
i mean it's both (22:31 - 22:36)
but you like you can underline your (22:33 - 22:38)
is here's the thing is removing the (22:36 - 22:40)
button the problem this is the same (22:38 - 22:42)
company that can't even toggle a shiny (22:40 - 22:45)
on and off so they're like (22:42 - 22:47)
it's easier to change the price and (22:45 - 22:49)
leave that button there (22:47 - 22:50)
we've already got that entry programmed (22:49 - 22:52)
in the shopping cart it's easier to (22:50 - 22:53)
change the price and to actually remove (22:52 - 22:55)
that from the thousand tables that it's (22:53 - 22:57)
recorded in (22:55 - 22:59)
i'm i'm actually probably that's (22:57 - 23:01)
probably the actual thing is like we (22:59 - 23:03)
can't remove it before go fest because (23:01 - 23:05)
something's gonna break (23:03 - 23:08)
and we can't break our store (23:05 - 23:11)
um (23:08 - 23:12)
the i don't think the ro i don't think (23:11 - 23:14)
there was (23:12 - 23:15)
hmm (23:14 - 23:17)
i don't think there's any way to adjust (23:15 - 23:20)
the remote right past thing (23:17 - 23:23)
because the hardcore player base is so (23:20 - 23:26)
invested in raiding (23:23 - 23:28)
um and spending money and they like (23:26 - 23:31)
spending money there well like (23:28 - 23:34)
this is maybe uh uh (23:31 - 23:36)
look there's there's a player base that (23:34 - 23:38)
is very adamant about pokemon go they (23:36 - 23:40)
like the raids they they like to get the (23:38 - 23:41)
hundreds they like to get the shinies (23:40 - 23:43)
they like to remote in there are (23:41 - 23:45)
literally patreons and discords (23:43 - 23:49)
dedicated to people paying to be in that (23:45 - 23:51)
discord to then constantly raid with (23:49 - 23:54)
other people like these things exist (23:51 - 23:55)
those people are probably going to be (23:54 - 23:57)
the loudest (23:55 - 23:59)
um (23:57 - 24:00)
so (23:59 - 24:02)
when i say i don't think there's any way (24:00 - 24:04)
to (24:02 - 24:07)
go back on the remote raid past things (24:04 - 24:10)
i have from pokemon go live april 15th (24:07 - 24:12)
in 2020 (24:10 - 24:13)
some things niantic said about remote (24:12 - 24:15)
raid passing (24:13 - 24:18)
uh (24:15 - 24:18)
it says with remote raid passing an (24:19 - 24:22)
upcoming new item you'll be able to join (24:21 - 24:24)
a raid battle that you can see on the (24:22 - 24:26)
nearby screen or uh that you can tap on (24:24 - 24:29)
the menu only one remote raid pass will (24:26 - 24:31)
be required to join a raid you will be (24:29 - 24:33)
able to hold a limited amount of road (24:31 - 24:35)
remote raid passes at the time 20 (24:33 - 24:37)
trainers can join in with the same (24:35 - 24:38)
battle with a limited number of trainers (24:37 - 24:41)
using a remote raid pass uh remote and (24:38 - 24:43)
raid passes will (24:41 - 24:45)
oh that doesn't matter at launch (24:43 - 24:47)
trainers battling in remote raids will (24:45 - 24:49)
have the same attack power as trainers (24:47 - 24:51)
tour battling at the raid location in (24:49 - 24:54)
person at a later time the attack power (24:51 - 24:56)
of trainers battling in remote raids (24:54 - 24:58)
will be reduced afterwards a trainer (24:56 - 25:01)
battling at the raid location in person (24:58 - 25:04)
will have a higher attack paddle (25:01 - 25:06)
attack power than a trainer battling (25:04 - 25:08)
remotely we will be making adjustments (25:06 - 25:10)
to this feature over time including the (25:08 - 25:12)
number of changes to trainers who can (25:10 - 25:14)
join remotely the ability to invite (25:12 - 25:17)
friends regardless of location (25:14 - 25:19)
so i yeah they could do that too the uh (25:17 - 25:21)
mention of the adjustment of attack (25:19 - 25:24)
power we will announce changes via (25:21 - 25:25)
official channels please stay tuned for (25:24 - 25:26)
updates (25:25 - 25:29)
um they also say at launch remote rate (25:26 - 25:32)
passes will be able to buy individually (25:29 - 25:33)
at the special discounted price of a (25:32 - 25:36)
hundred pokey coins (25:33 - 25:38)
so they they said over two years ago (25:36 - 25:40)
that a hundred poke coins for a remote (25:38 - 25:44)
rate pass is discounted and that there (25:40 - 25:48)
will be a an attack power nerf (25:44 - 25:48)
that does that mean does that make this (25:50 - 25:56)
today any better no no but the the (25:53 - 25:58)
second they change the remote rate power (25:56 - 26:00)
people are gonna be also upset it's it (25:58 - 26:03)
is it is the just because you gave (26:00 - 26:06)
yourself an out doesn't mean after two (26:03 - 26:09)
and a half years of having a global (26:06 - 26:10)
experience and being able to go with (26:09 - 26:13)
your friends that making those changes (26:10 - 26:15)
aren't going to make people angry (26:13 - 26:17)
just because i said oh (26:15 - 26:20)
all of everything in half price books is (26:17 - 26:21)
half price (26:20 - 26:23)
but at some point we could change it to (26:21 - 26:25)
full price books doesn't mean people are (26:23 - 26:26)
going to be like (26:25 - 26:28)
well i'll keep shopping there because (26:26 - 26:30)
you warned me two years ago that you (26:28 - 26:32)
could change the bookstore greg there's (26:30 - 26:34)
no other bookstore (26:32 - 26:37)
i mean it's it's madness that they're (26:34 - 26:39)
like oh well any company that does that (26:37 - 26:42)
well we warned you two years ago that we (26:39 - 26:45)
could do this at any time so therefore (26:42 - 26:48)
you shouldn't be upset by it (26:45 - 26:48)
okay (26:49 - 26:53)
that's how that works (26:50 - 26:54)
now they got to do it sneakily like you (26:53 - 26:56)
know like the cookie companies that (26:54 - 26:59)
slowly take out you know two cookies per (26:56 - 27:01)
year oh yeah and raise the price by five (26:59 - 27:03)
cents per year (27:01 - 27:07)
new new new packaging new smaller (27:03 - 27:09)
diet versions of the exact doritos where (27:07 - 27:10)
you're paying the same amount of money (27:09 - 27:13)
for less (27:10 - 27:13)
ah those are diet ritos is what they're (27:13 - 27:17)
called (27:15 - 27:19)
cool ranch diet rita's diet (27:17 - 27:23)
oh i am an advertising genius (27:19 - 27:27)
dietrich mr calling (27:23 - 27:27)
it (27:37 - 27:39)
it seems like it seems like niantic is (27:41 - 27:46)
conflicted between liking the revenue (27:43 - 27:48)
stream that remote rate passes are (27:46 - 27:51)
coming in versus the uh we want people (27:48 - 27:53)
to play the other parts of our game i (27:51 - 27:54)
mean (27:53 - 27:56)
it honestly feels like (27:54 - 27:58)
every decision that they make is an (27:56 - 28:01)
attempt to just justify their stated (27:58 - 28:05)
mission and the bottom line is money is (28:01 - 28:07)
the bottom mission so they like they (28:05 - 28:09)
can't really lead and do it we just want (28:07 - 28:11)
to make money (28:09 - 28:13)
so instead it's like we want people to (28:11 - 28:15)
explore and be (28:13 - 28:17)
friends (28:15 - 28:19)
and give us money (28:17 - 28:20)
it's just the same like anything i mean (28:19 - 28:22)
i mean people pay money their game is (28:20 - 28:25)
free to play they do want money to pay (28:22 - 28:26)
you (28:25 - 28:29)
but anytime anybody pays to skip your (28:26 - 28:33)
experience it's not a fun experience (28:29 - 28:33)
i mean like you could you can pay to get (28:33 - 28:38)
pokeballs and you are getting ripped off (28:35 - 28:39)
oh yeah (28:38 - 28:40)
but like (28:39 - 28:42)
yeah but the real players never pay for (28:40 - 28:43)
pokeballs (28:42 - 28:46)
i don't know about that i'm i i don't (28:43 - 28:48)
there could be very then those aren't (28:46 - 28:49)
real players (28:48 - 28:51)
[Laughter] (28:49 - 28:52)
like (28:51 - 28:54)
that logical fallacy kids (28:52 - 28:57)
i i have never paid for pokeballs (28:54 - 29:01)
there have been instances where i've (28:57 - 29:03)
there has been one time where i was (29:01 - 29:06)
playing at home and it was like the st (29:03 - 29:09)
louis makeup day event that (29:06 - 29:11)
where we were supposed to go to st louis (29:09 - 29:14)
it got cancelled and (29:11 - 29:16)
i i did run out of pokeballs (29:14 - 29:19)
at the end of that event (29:16 - 29:21)
um and then i think i ended up opening (29:19 - 29:23)
up like 20 gifts and i got like 100 more (29:21 - 29:25)
pokeballs from it and i was like do i (29:23 - 29:26)
have to buy pokeballs because i was like (29:25 - 29:28)
streaming on twitch and i was like i (29:26 - 29:28)
can't (29:28 - 29:30)
i can't just get up and leave and even (29:28 - 29:32)
if i did get up and leave i only have (29:30 - 29:35)
like two stops near my house at the time (29:32 - 29:38)
but like i i could easily go to downtown (29:35 - 29:40)
minneapolis or (29:38 - 29:42)
any of the parks in in (29:40 - 29:46)
minneapolis and spend 10 minutes and get (29:42 - 29:48)
200 some pokeballs (29:46 - 29:50)
but again it goes back to that rock ruff (29:48 - 29:52)
situation is like do i spend 20 minutes (29:50 - 29:53)
to get 200 pokeballs or i don't even (29:52 - 29:55)
know how much 200 pokeballs is in the (29:53 - 29:57)
store it's not great it's like (29:55 - 29:59)
it's probably like three dollars or (29:57 - 30:01)
something (29:59 - 30:01)
how much is it i have it open (30:05 - 30:10)
a hundred poke balls is (30:08 - 30:14)
460 coins yeah there you go scammers (30:10 - 30:17)
around 100 pokeballs is 800 coins (30:14 - 30:19)
madness (30:17 - 30:21)
but i i would assume that it's priced (30:19 - 30:23)
that way (30:21 - 30:27)
because they don't want you to do that (30:23 - 30:27)
like who (30:28 - 30:32)
eight dollars for 200 pokeballs is (30:29 - 30:33)
actually outrageous but that's how it's (30:32 - 30:37)
always been who who is buying stickers (30:33 - 30:39)
oh i bought i buy stickers every now and (30:37 - 30:41)
then i i believe that i believe i don't (30:39 - 30:43)
even look at stickers and he's out here (30:41 - 30:44)
spending money on stickers they're cute (30:43 - 30:46)
why are you buying stickers why would (30:44 - 30:48)
you buy stickers in real life they don't (30:46 - 30:50)
do anything you slap it on your bumper (30:48 - 30:51)
and then whatever (30:50 - 30:53)
the question still stands why would you (30:51 - 30:55)
do it in real life and why would you do (30:53 - 30:58)
it in game you just said you would do it (30:55 - 30:59)
have you never sent a letter to somebody (30:58 - 31:02)
and like put stickers in it or like no (30:59 - 31:06)
decorate the outside i have a hand and (31:02 - 31:09)
multi-colored pencils (31:06 - 31:09)
but i have i have a buddy who is into (31:09 - 31:14)
real-life stickers and whenever you look (31:12 - 31:16)
at anything he owns it's covered in (31:14 - 31:18)
stickers and i'm like well great you've (31:16 - 31:21)
personalized that but digital (31:18 - 31:24)
digital stickers now why are you buying (31:21 - 31:27)
digital stickers this is like i almost (31:24 - 31:29)
would be willing to pay a subscription (31:27 - 31:32)
price to niantic to say please remove (31:29 - 31:34)
stickers from my that you're just gonna (31:32 - 31:36)
why are you paying for digital clothing (31:34 - 31:38)
you can't do anything with it exactly (31:36 - 31:40)
why are you paying for digital clothing (31:38 - 31:44)
you can't because it makes me happy greg (31:40 - 31:45)
maybe you need to get your happiness (31:44 - 31:47)
evaluated you're happy for the wrong (31:45 - 31:49)
things (31:47 - 31:51)
i mean you are digital raid passes i (31:49 - 31:54)
either go away after you use them i will (31:51 - 31:57)
just make this one point (31:54 - 31:59)
you had a bunch of digital assets and (31:57 - 32:03)
destiny one and that ended in sadness (31:59 - 32:07)
and you refuse to learn the lesson (32:03 - 32:09)
it no the the the lesson in stickers is (32:07 - 32:13)
like i'm sending greg a postcard with a (32:09 - 32:16)
premium sticker that i bought it's what (32:13 - 32:18)
is it i think it's like 25 stickers for (32:16 - 32:20)
40 cents or something like that i think (32:18 - 32:21)
that's what i'm doing (32:20 - 32:22)
um (32:21 - 32:24)
i've bought stickers like twice and i (32:22 - 32:26)
bought the little like the pikachu that (32:24 - 32:28)
was like squirting water and was like (32:26 - 32:32)
squee it was very cute anyways um (32:28 - 32:32)
i i (32:39 - 32:44)
i don't i think (32:42 - 32:48)
that the remote raid pass thing (32:44 - 32:48)
i think that the remote raid pass thing (32:49 - 32:53)
is is is going to continue to be this (32:51 - 32:56)
this ongoing issue at least on social (32:53 - 32:59)
media of people complaining true um i (32:56 - 33:01)
think it's going to happen regardless (32:59 - 33:05)
i i can't imagine though (33:01 - 33:05)
that (33:05 - 33:10)
the majority of pokemon go players (33:06 - 33:13)
are are just buying remote raid passes (33:10 - 33:14)
left and right (33:13 - 33:17)
i can imagine (33:14 - 33:20)
that there are people that highly rely (33:17 - 33:22)
on that free raid pass and they do their (33:20 - 33:24)
one free raid a week (33:22 - 33:26)
or they're like (33:24 - 33:29)
i'm going to do my one tapu fini i got (33:26 - 33:31)
my tapu fini i'm never going to do (33:29 - 33:32)
another top buffing again because i (33:31 - 33:35)
don't care about ivs or i don't care (33:32 - 33:36)
about (33:35 - 33:37)
cp (33:36 - 33:39)
and they can't be shiny (33:37 - 33:41)
um (33:39 - 33:43)
or like i'm missing rayquaza when (33:41 - 33:45)
rayquaza comes back i'm going to use my (33:43 - 33:46)
free remote rate pass okay now i have (33:45 - 33:48)
rayquaza for the ducks (33:46 - 33:50)
but i would assume (33:48 - 33:51)
that (33:50 - 33:55)
the majority of remote raid pass users (33:51 - 33:57)
are whales (33:55 - 33:58)
that are (33:57 - 34:00)
just (33:58 - 34:02)
burning through them to get perfect ivs (34:00 - 34:05)
or to get the shiny (34:02 - 34:08)
but even at that point like let's say so (34:05 - 34:10)
there there would be the player that is (34:08 - 34:11)
there's (34:10 - 34:12)
there would be the player that would be (34:11 - 34:15)
like i just want it for the decks (34:12 - 34:16)
there would be the player that (34:15 - 34:18)
i just wanted for the decks but i also (34:16 - 34:20)
just want the shiny as well (34:18 - 34:22)
and then there would be the player is (34:20 - 34:24)
like i want it for the dex i want the (34:22 - 34:28)
shiny i want the 100 iv i want the shiny (34:24 - 34:30)
at 100 iv (34:28 - 34:32)
or even there's probably the also the (34:30 - 34:34)
player is i want the one that is like 0 (34:32 - 34:38)
15 15 for go battle league (34:34 - 34:38)
yeah i mean that's a lot of variables (34:39 - 34:42)
but (34:42 - 34:46)
the main issue is that the people who (34:42 - 34:47)
care about (34:46 - 34:50)
remote raid passes will be vocal (34:47 - 34:52)
when there are changes and the people (34:50 - 34:55)
who don't care will continue to not say (34:52 - 34:56)
anything right because they don't care (34:55 - 34:58)
so the only thing that gets noticed are (34:56 - 35:02)
the people who are talking (34:58 - 35:02)
yeah that didn't i mean that didn't fix (35:02 - 35:05)
the uh the incense issue (35:04 - 35:07)
[Laughter] (35:05 - 35:09)
which arguably maybe affected more (35:07 - 35:11)
people (35:09 - 35:11)
i mean i think remote raid passes (35:15 - 35:19)
affects (35:17 - 35:22)
a lot of people who are in areas like (35:19 - 35:24)
they said in rural areas who have to (35:22 - 35:25)
rely on other people inviting them to (35:24 - 35:28)
things yeah because they have no other (35:25 - 35:31)
option and i think that is a a big swath (35:28 - 35:32)
of people (35:31 - 35:34)
yeah that that aren't maybe best the (35:32 - 35:36)
people that are spending the most money (35:34 - 35:38)
but it is one of the only ways that they (35:36 - 35:40)
can feel like they are included in this (35:38 - 35:41)
game (35:40 - 35:43)
and when you take (35:41 - 35:46)
away opportunities for them to earn easy (35:43 - 35:49)
coins because again earning coins relies (35:46 - 35:50)
on (35:49 - 35:52)
the freeway as defending gyms which if (35:50 - 35:54)
you're in a rural area (35:52 - 35:56)
you don't got a lot so you're relying on (35:54 - 35:58)
that or you're spending what money you (35:56 - 36:00)
have into the game to try to enjoy (35:58 - 36:02)
people with your friends also they're (36:00 - 36:05)
stressing a (36:02 - 36:07)
local (36:05 - 36:09)
experience on a global game like it's (36:07 - 36:11)
been global now for two and a half years (36:09 - 36:14)
because we had no choice (36:11 - 36:17)
so it's like (36:14 - 36:19)
you you inadvertently are hurting a (36:17 - 36:21)
bunch of people and (36:19 - 36:23)
having a throwaway line like we are (36:21 - 36:24)
going to try to get things (36:23 - 36:28)
better for y'all (36:24 - 36:28)
when (36:28 - 36:30)
what like what does that look like well (36:29 - 36:33)
what does better mean that's a question (36:30 - 36:34)
for players who have difficulty reaching (36:33 - 36:36)
gyms will continue to work on solutions (36:34 - 36:38)
such as tool for community leaders to (36:36 - 36:40)
organize local events so you could be (36:38 - 36:42)
the only people like you're in a rural (36:40 - 36:44)
area how many people in your area are (36:42 - 36:46)
playing pokemon go (36:44 - 36:48)
and faster approval for new gyms but (36:46 - 36:49)
your gym requirements your stock (36:48 - 36:52)
requirements are incredibly specific (36:49 - 36:53)
so if you're in the middle of nowhere (36:52 - 36:55)
what i'm going to do here's here's a (36:53 - 36:57)
multi-colored stock of corn (36:55 - 36:59)
i think everybody should build it i (36:57 - 37:01)
think i don't think they're too specific (36:59 - 37:02)
it does it does take a long time to (37:01 - 37:04)
approve (37:02 - 37:06)
but that that's that's that's just like (37:04 - 37:08)
the wayfarer thing right like that (37:06 - 37:10)
that's that's not specifically a problem (37:08 - 37:11)
with (37:10 - 37:15)
pokemon go that that is like wayfarer (37:11 - 37:16)
is pulling (37:15 - 37:19)
but it has to be a local attraction that (37:16 - 37:20)
people would want to visit (37:19 - 37:24)
an important piece of art (37:20 - 37:24)
i think that i think that stuff is easy (37:25 - 37:28)
to find though like i i have submitted (37:26 - 37:30)
tons of stops (37:28 - 37:31)
and and and some of them would sit in (37:30 - 37:34)
the wayfarer queue for six months yeah (37:31 - 37:37)
but i mean you have to convince again (37:34 - 37:38)
we're talking about rural areas that (37:37 - 37:40)
don't have a lot (37:38 - 37:41)
so (37:40 - 37:43)
what are they picking what are they (37:41 - 37:45)
picking that meets those requirements (37:43 - 37:47)
and then sits in a queue for seven (37:45 - 37:49)
months (37:47 - 37:50)
and only to be like people look at it (37:49 - 37:52)
and go well i don't know what that is i (37:50 - 37:53)
don't know where it is it doesn't look (37:52 - 37:55)
like art (37:53 - 37:57)
so no and have it denied like what does (37:55 - 37:59)
that look like because i've gone into (37:57 - 38:01)
the wayfarer queue and i'm like i'll (37:59 - 38:02)
just prove everything because it all (38:01 - 38:05)
looks like art to me i can't sure if if (38:02 - 38:08)
you if you live in if you live on a 700 (38:05 - 38:10)
acre farm by yourself (38:08 - 38:12)
probably not a lot to submit what do you (38:10 - 38:16)
think rural means i know exactly what do (38:12 - 38:18)
you think rural is these are towns that (38:16 - 38:22)
have literally a bar a gas station in 15 (38:18 - 38:25)
houses and the rest is farmland (38:22 - 38:26)
yeah (38:25 - 38:28)
and the bar (38:26 - 38:30)
could be a stop i've been to plenty of (38:28 - 38:31)
bars that are stops or not stops but (38:30 - 38:33)
gyms like when like there was a bar (38:31 - 38:36)
across my street in milwaukee that was a (38:33 - 38:38)
gym (38:36 - 38:38)
could be like they need to like spell (38:41 - 38:47)
this out like what like for rural people (38:44 - 38:50)
will they accept but okay (38:47 - 38:50)
this is not a problem of pokemon go this (38:51 - 38:55)
is a problem of all niantics games which (38:53 - 38:58)
is a way fairer thing oh so (38:55 - 38:59)
what they're what they're saying here is (38:58 - 39:01)
like we're trying to make wayfarer (38:59 - 39:02)
better without saying we need to make (39:01 - 39:04)
way fair better better but wayfarer work (39:02 - 39:05)
lies (39:04 - 39:08)
on people it's community built (39:05 - 39:09)
like (39:08 - 39:11)
niantic it trusts (39:09 - 39:13)
that people (39:11 - 39:15)
it's like the wikipedia thing like not (39:13 - 39:18)
like niantic is trusting people to (39:15 - 39:20)
submit stuff and to then approve stuff (39:18 - 39:22)
properly and then you have situations (39:20 - 39:24)
like are happening in india where a (39:22 - 39:25)
bunch of people will band together in (39:24 - 39:29)
the community and put like 500 gyms in (39:25 - 39:30)
in a street (39:29 - 39:32)
and then just (39:30 - 39:34)
go crazy until somebody reports that and (39:32 - 39:37)
then niantic has to clean it up (39:34 - 39:39)
which it seems like there should be a (39:37 - 39:41)
better way for them to control their (39:39 - 39:44)
game (39:41 - 39:44)
again it's supposed to be community (39:44 - 39:47)
built (39:45 - 39:49)
but like that's that's what wayfarer is (39:47 - 39:50)
like they don't know but if we've (39:49 - 39:53)
learned anything from the four billion (39:50 - 39:55)
years the internet have been around from (39:53 - 39:57)
amazon reviews (39:55 - 40:00)
from any community user based they are (39:57 - 40:03)
notoriously bad and unreliable if you (40:00 - 40:06)
don't have solid moderation (40:03 - 40:06)
uh yeah i think this is moderate (40:07 - 40:12)
moderating a worldwide game (40:09 - 40:13)
is is hard (40:12 - 40:16)
how many employees do they have for like (40:13 - 40:18)
wayfarer alone (40:16 - 40:20)
and what are those wayfarer people doing (40:18 - 40:22)
billions of enough dollars to hire more (40:20 - 40:25)
employees like (40:22 - 40:27)
i i don't know if that argument (40:25 - 40:28)
completely works because yeah sure (40:27 - 40:30)
pokemon go makes a lot of money but how (40:28 - 40:32)
much of that money is directly going to (40:30 - 40:34)
tp the pokemon company and how much of (40:32 - 40:38)
that money is going to niantic (40:34 - 40:40)
like like like who knows how many people (40:38 - 40:42)
are gonna throw out how many people are (40:40 - 40:45)
you gonna throw at wayfair (40:42 - 40:45)
and get that problem (40:46 - 40:51)
is is that that niantic can't put (40:48 - 40:53)
together a budget proposal that says (40:51 - 40:55)
we're seeing this deleterious effect on (40:53 - 40:57)
our player base we need to hire 10 more (40:55 - 41:00)
staff at this point more staff is not (40:57 - 41:04)
going to fix 100 more staff (41:00 - 41:04)
and tpci says yes we agree that's having (41:04 - 41:08)
a deleterious effect or no we don't (41:06 - 41:12)
agree and then the decision is made (41:08 - 41:12)
i mean i ain't got no answers they (41:18 - 41:23)
haven't made me president of niantic yet (41:20 - 41:25)
yet (41:23 - 41:25)
i uh (41:28 - 41:32)
wayfair seems to be its own problem (41:29 - 41:34)
and it just happens to affect pikmin and (41:32 - 41:38)
go and ingress and whatever well i mean (41:34 - 41:40)
sourcing anything is always a problem (41:38 - 41:41)
because people will gain (41:40 - 41:45)
whatever the yeah and when you sure like (41:41 - 41:48)
the india situation where (41:45 - 41:50)
a bunch of gyms appear in a street like (41:48 - 41:52)
like this is this is a thing that (41:50 - 41:55)
happens every couple months where like (41:52 - 41:56)
i'm not exaggerating like 40 gyms will (41:55 - 41:58)
appear on a single street (41:56 - 41:59)
and then (41:58 - 42:00)
um (41:59 - 42:02)
it'll get reported on the self-road and (42:00 - 42:03)
then (42:02 - 42:06)
which is extra dumb because if you can (42:03 - 42:07)
tell me that a company out here is (42:06 - 42:09)
saying that they can have artificial (42:07 - 42:12)
intelligence that can tell my emotional (42:09 - 42:15)
whatever from the video and audio of a (42:12 - 42:17)
zoom phone call but they can't have an (42:15 - 42:20)
artificial intelligence say hey wait 40 (42:17 - 42:23)
gyms just popped up in a one mile well (42:20 - 42:25)
it's community built so those people in (42:23 - 42:28)
that community have have submitted the (42:25 - 42:31)
gyms and then approved each other's gyms (42:28 - 42:33)
but google does can't have a super (42:31 - 42:35)
intelligence it's google yeah i already (42:33 - 42:37)
know (42:35 - 42:37)
i mean it is wild to be like here's a (42:38 - 42:44)
here's a product that affects all of (42:41 - 42:45)
their games (42:44 - 42:46)
but (42:45 - 42:47)
i have (42:46 - 42:48)
they (42:47 - 42:50)
fix it i guess i don't know they (42:48 - 42:51)
shouldn't do anything with it it's a (42:50 - 42:54)
community problem like it affects (42:51 - 42:56)
all of your games you would think in a (42:54 - 42:58)
game where you claim you want to build a (42:56 - 43:00)
community (42:58 - 43:03)
you would have a better way of dealing (43:00 - 43:05)
with this and to say like oh well we (43:03 - 43:07)
don't know how much money goes here we (43:05 - 43:09)
no we don't and it doesn't matter (43:07 - 43:11)
because that's what running a business (43:09 - 43:14)
is like it is up to them to look at a (43:11 - 43:16)
problem that is affecting their games (43:14 - 43:19)
across the board (43:16 - 43:21)
everything they make (43:19 - 43:23)
do you really think niantic employees (43:21 - 43:25)
aren't doing anything with wafer (43:23 - 43:26)
wayfair do you think they're just (43:25 - 43:28)
sitting there being like well we're (43:26 - 43:30)
waiting for joe to approve that stop at (43:28 - 43:32)
mayfair mall for the last six months joe (43:30 - 43:34)
when you gonna do that like i am sure (43:32 - 43:36)
they are working (43:34 - 43:39)
i but like i i have submitted stuff at (43:36 - 43:41)
mayfair mall and it didn't get approved (43:39 - 43:42)
okay but then (43:41 - 43:45)
go back to admitted it again go back to (43:42 - 43:48)
the original problem they said community (43:45 - 43:50)
leaders can (43:48 - 43:52)
do whatever to nominate raid things and (43:50 - 43:55)
we're saying if it takes eight months (43:52 - 43:58)
to get a raid location cleared (43:55 - 44:00)
how does that fix anything the community (43:58 - 44:01)
members are gonna say yeah we're gonna (44:00 - 44:04)
have a raid here in in a year in a year (44:01 - 44:06)
you know (44:04 - 44:07)
hope (44:06 - 44:09)
hope you hope you can you're still (44:07 - 44:11)
you know around (44:09 - 44:13)
no what i what i'm what i'm saying is (44:11 - 44:15)
the problem is i i have gone to mayfair (44:13 - 44:18)
mall i have submitted two murals (44:15 - 44:20)
one on each end of the mall they got (44:18 - 44:21)
denied (44:20 - 44:22)
it took three months they sat in the (44:21 - 44:24)
system for three months they got denied (44:22 - 44:26)
i went back i submitted them again i was (44:24 - 44:28)
like maybe the picture wasn't good maybe (44:26 - 44:31)
the the the title wasn't good (44:28 - 44:35)
uh a month later they got denied (44:31 - 44:37)
two months before i moved from milwaukee (44:35 - 44:39)
and a year after i submitted these (44:37 - 44:40)
murals (44:39 - 44:43)
both are now poke stops somebody else (44:40 - 44:44)
submitted them and (44:43 - 44:47)
somebody else approved approve them (44:44 - 44:49)
like like (44:47 - 44:52)
unfortunately that's part of the like (44:49 - 44:54)
it's both good and bad but things were (44:52 - 44:56)
saying before you have people in these (44:54 - 44:58)
rural areas that are gonna nominate the (44:56 - 44:59)
one thing in there and somebody's gonna (44:58 - 45:01)
come through who has no idea about the (44:59 - 45:03)
area and be like well that doesn't even (45:01 - 45:04)
look like what you're saying it is (45:03 - 45:06)
denied (45:04 - 45:08)
like they're like if you want to fix (45:06 - 45:10)
these problems and build these community (45:08 - 45:12)
things you need to put more resources (45:10 - 45:14)
towards it it's not saying that they (45:12 - 45:16)
don't have i'm not nobody's saying they (45:14 - 45:18)
don't do any work on it the the thing is (45:16 - 45:20)
is they aren't doing enough (45:18 - 45:22)
and is affecting all of their games (45:20 - 45:23)
across (45:22 - 45:26)
but you you guys are acting like like (45:23 - 45:28)
hiring a hundred people just fixes this (45:26 - 45:31)
i work we're not i work on the potential (45:28 - 45:33)
solutions we don't know what the actual (45:31 - 45:35)
answer is (45:33 - 45:37)
i worked on the apple maps team when i (45:35 - 45:38)
worked for apple (45:37 - 45:40)
well unfortunately apple maps is garbage (45:38 - 45:42)
still is kind of to this day but when (45:40 - 45:44)
apple maps first log log first came out (45:42 - 45:47)
it wasn't great and one of my jobs was (45:44 - 45:48)
to (45:47 - 45:51)
verify with google maps whether or not (45:48 - 45:54)
the street or this turn existed (45:51 - 45:57)
and they would assign you areas (45:54 - 46:00)
but i would then get areas like texas (45:57 - 46:01)
and they would be like all right here's (46:00 - 46:04)
google maps here's apple maps is this is (46:01 - 46:05)
this turn correct (46:04 - 46:08)
oh like well it says that on google maps (46:05 - 46:09)
i've never been here i don't actually (46:08 - 46:11)
know if that still exists this is the (46:09 - 46:14)
problem with wafewear wayfair if you (46:11 - 46:16)
have if you hire a hundred more people (46:14 - 46:19)
to be like hey does this pokestop exist (46:16 - 46:20)
in duluth (46:19 - 46:23)
minnesota the person could be like (46:20 - 46:24)
yeah maybe (46:23 - 46:26)
but i've never been there that's the (46:24 - 46:28)
whole point so yeah that the way we're (46:26 - 46:29)
looking at the problem is a little (46:28 - 46:30)
different let's let's look at a (46:29 - 46:33)
different technology right can we all (46:30 - 46:34)
agree (46:33 - 46:37)
that tesla self-driving does not work (46:34 - 46:39)
yes (46:37 - 46:41)
self-driving in tesla they say we have (46:39 - 46:43)
self-driving cars we know it does not (46:41 - 46:44)
work correct (46:43 - 46:46)
correct so now what we're saying is (46:44 - 46:49)
niantic is tesla (46:46 - 46:50)
and (46:49 - 46:52)
niantic as tesla is saying (46:50 - 46:54)
we're going to have a pizza delivery (46:52 - 46:56)
service based on our self-driving (46:54 - 46:57)
technology (46:56 - 46:59)
and what greg and will are saying is fix (46:57 - 47:02)
your self-driving technology (46:59 - 47:04)
before you promise us a pizza delivery (47:02 - 47:07)
service don't promise us that community (47:04 - 47:10)
leaders can host events or nominate (47:07 - 47:12)
events or create events in a location (47:10 - 47:15)
when your location nominating service (47:12 - 47:17)
does not work i don't care if they hire (47:15 - 47:19)
a thousand people i don't hire if they (47:17 - 47:21)
know i care if they get a crazed super (47:19 - 47:24)
computer that can do it you have to fix (47:21 - 47:26)
the first part before you promise (47:24 - 47:29)
correct the second part (47:26 - 47:32)
and before you take away one of the only (47:29 - 47:34)
solutions that exists which is cheap (47:32 - 47:37)
rate passes for people in those areas (47:34 - 47:39)
yeah exactly take it away it's still (47:37 - 47:41)
there it's still hot it costs more money (47:39 - 47:42)
they took away the one dollar the one (47:41 - 47:44)
coin (47:42 - 47:45)
okay and the event i don't know if it's (47:44 - 47:47)
worth i i've been thinking about this as (47:45 - 47:49)
we've been recording the show (47:47 - 47:51)
we've spent 30 minutes talking about 50 (47:49 - 47:53)
cents we've literally spent 30 minutes (47:51 - 47:55)
talking about 50 cents this is what we (47:53 - 47:58)
do like yes the 50 cents adds up but (47:55 - 48:00)
like let's like it's not the end of the (47:58 - 48:02)
world (48:00 - 48:03)
like that's like go that's like going to (48:02 - 48:04)
a restaurant and being like oh (48:03 - 48:06)
everything's so expensive here so i'm (48:04 - 48:07)
not going to tip well if you don't want (48:06 - 48:11)
to tip then then then make food at home (48:07 - 48:13)
like it's part of the experience like a (48:11 - 48:15)
hundred co it's a dollar to do a raid (48:13 - 48:17)
sure if you get three raids it's 250. (48:15 - 48:20)
but it's a dollar to do a raid as people (48:17 - 48:22)
who are comfortable with the salaries (48:20 - 48:24)
that they get that is not a conversation (48:22 - 48:28)
i feel comfortable signing on to (48:24 - 48:28)
if i don't know i'm under the impression (48:30 - 48:34)
of 50 cents (48:32 - 48:36)
if if we spent 30 minutes talking about (48:34 - 48:37)
50 cents like (48:36 - 48:39)
yes it sucks yeah it's upsetting but (48:37 - 48:41)
like (48:39 - 48:42)
don't like don't play pokemon go then (48:41 - 48:45)
like if if you can't yeah (48:42 - 48:47)
but i mean we've been saying for a while (48:45 - 48:49)
don't play pokemon go if you're in rural (48:47 - 48:51)
areas this is just another nail in that (48:49 - 48:53)
coffin (48:51 - 48:55)
but it but the the thing is it's it's (48:53 - 48:57)
it's going to go up from 100 poke coins (48:55 - 48:59)
i wouldn't be surprised if ray passes (48:57 - 49:02)
cost two bucks oh yeah i mean (48:59 - 49:05)
they are they are like get out now (49:02 - 49:07)
people like if you're in a rural area if (49:05 - 49:10)
you rely on these things if again it is (49:07 - 49:12)
very difficult for you to get out of (49:10 - 49:14)
your house (49:12 - 49:17)
even though you live in a city (49:14 - 49:18)
this game is no longer willing to (49:17 - 49:20)
support you (49:18 - 49:22)
get out now it's the fundamental rule of (49:20 - 49:25)
relationships if your partner makes it (49:22 - 49:27)
clear that they don't want good things (49:25 - 49:31)
for you you believe (49:27 - 49:31)
[Laughter] (49:31 - 49:37)
i didn't know what we were at for time (49:34 - 49:37)
uh we will be right back (49:40 - 49:47)
and we are back from our break (49:42 - 49:49)
uh (49:47 - 49:51)
okay i'm gonna say the words pokemon go (49:49 - 49:52)
but this is regarding the trading card (49:51 - 49:55)
game not (49:52 - 49:55)
i get you i understand what you're (49:56 - 50:01)
saying pokemon go expansion (49:58 - 50:03)

lives up to its name doing 160 damage (50:31 - 50:35)
plus 60 more damage for additional (50:33 - 50:38)
energy attached with a maximum of 280 (50:35 - 50:41)
damage for five energy attached (50:38 - 50:43)
um (50:41 - 50:46)
it also appears as impressive as its (50:43 - 50:49)
gigantomax uh pokemon even though (50:46 - 50:51)
giganti max pokemon currently do not (50:49 - 50:53)
appear in the pokemon go game i don't (50:51 - 50:55)
know why pokemon needed pokemon.com (50:53 - 50:58)
needed to like state that but oh because (50:55 - 51:00)
of the whole dugong thing (50:58 - 51:03)
oh yeah (51:00 - 51:04)
oh yeah (51:03 - 51:06)
right and that's what it is it's like (51:04 - 51:08)
you can't even mention anything pokemon (51:06 - 51:11)
related without disqualifying (51:08 - 51:13)
uh the classic legendary birth trio (51:11 - 51:16)
comes to pokemon go expansion uh after (51:13 - 51:18)
being used for inspiration for the (51:16 - 51:20)
emblems of the three teams of pokemon go (51:18 - 51:22)
game articuno zapdos moltres all have (51:20 - 51:24)
powerful abilities that represent their (51:22 - 51:26)
two strengths each ability each of their (51:24 - 51:28)
abilities ice symbol lightning symbol (51:26 - 51:30)
and flare symbol respectively power up (51:28 - 51:32)
their basic pokemon abilities of the (51:30 - 51:34)
same type causing their attacks to do 10 (51:32 - 51:37)
more damage this affects stats this (51:34 - 51:38)
affects stacks (51:37 - 51:40)
when multiple articuno zapdos and mole (51:38 - 51:43)
trace are in play too (51:40 - 51:45)
uh these last two cards are actually the (51:43 - 51:46)
coolest ones i don't know if you guys (51:45 - 51:47)
saw the little like video that the (51:46 - 51:50)
japanese twitter tweeted yeah uh b-doof (51:47 - 51:52)
pauses on a stone in the middle of a (51:50 - 51:54)
rushing water not quite relaxing but (51:52 - 51:57)
quite on guard but when the pokemon (51:54 - 51:59)
evolves into b-barrel (51:57 - 52:01)
the action gets more intense of course (51:59 - 52:03)
you'll have a fir you have to first look (52:01 - 52:04)
past smeargle hopping in front of b (52:03 - 52:06)
barrel's big moment (52:04 - 52:08)
b barrel's (52:06 - 52:10)
reassuring damn ability stops your (52:08 - 52:12)
opponents from using abilities item (52:10 - 52:14)
cards or supporter cards (52:12 - 52:17)
to the discard pile from your deck (52:14 - 52:18)
and helping to keep (52:17 - 52:21)
cards in hand (52:18 - 52:23)
and then finally (52:21 - 52:24)
now here's something you don't see every (52:23 - 52:26)
day and if you're not looking closely (52:24 - 52:28)
you might miss it to find ditto in the (52:26 - 52:30)
pokemon go expansion look for other (52:28 - 52:32)
pokemon that can have a layer you peel (52:30 - 52:35)
off for the transform pokemon underneath (52:32 - 52:36)
note that the pokemon that rests on top (52:35 - 52:38)
of ditto can't be used competitively in (52:36 - 52:41)
official matches only ditto itself in (52:38 - 52:43)
fact you'll find a little ditto icon (52:41 - 52:45)
placed in the typical tournament (52:43 - 52:47)
registration mark (52:45 - 52:49)
so the ditto card is cool they i i (52:47 - 52:52)
tweeted a clip of it but they show (52:49 - 52:53)
it looks like a b doof card but it's (52:52 - 52:56)
like a like a sticker that you pull off (52:53 - 52:57)
of the card (52:56 - 52:59)
and then ruin the card for all time and (52:57 - 53:02)
all of its investment value is gone (52:59 - 53:04)
yeah you i'm assuming you keep the (53:02 - 53:06)
sticker on and then you put it next to (53:04 - 53:08)
ancient mew (53:06 - 53:09)
oh absolutely (53:08 - 53:12)
seal it in the vault how do you psa (53:09 - 53:14)
grade a sticker (53:12 - 53:17)
i i'm curious of the uh (53:14 - 53:20)
what is the word the stick-ocity (53:17 - 53:23)
the stickiness the the sticker to the (53:20 - 53:27)
card adhesiveness yes (53:23 - 53:28)
because if there if there's any company (53:27 - 53:31)
that's really good at like (53:28 - 53:35)
adhesiveness slash packaging it's apple (53:31 - 53:37)
like when you when you like take off the (53:35 - 53:41)
cellophane or like open the box or like (53:37 - 53:43)
remove the the (53:41 - 53:45)
the screen protector thingy like it's (53:43 - 53:48)
all like apple spends (53:45 - 53:50)
millions on making sure that that's like (53:48 - 53:53)
the perfect pull or the perfect open i (53:50 - 53:55)
mean fundamentally it's very rare that (53:53 - 53:58)
you would uh remove an adhesive from an (53:55 - 54:00)
apple product and have that it tears the (53:58 - 54:03)
paint off the cardboard experience (54:00 - 54:06)
yeah the box stays good (54:03 - 54:09)
we but we know that the that the what (54:06 - 54:11)
does that company call it (54:09 - 54:13)
the company they just bought that prints (54:11 - 54:16)
the cards we know they can't even (54:13 - 54:19)
centered oh dear (54:16 - 54:22)
so i'm i'm i'm curious of how this uh (54:19 - 54:24)
adhesive thing will work (54:22 - 54:26)
it's a very cool concept i'm really (54:24 - 54:28)
excited to like see it in person (54:26 - 54:30)
i'm i'm just curious what the the (54:28 - 54:32)
stickiness is gonna be (54:30 - 54:34)
um i i really i really do like the (54:32 - 54:36)
smeargle in front of b barrel i think (54:34 - 54:39)
it's a really nice pokemon go touch (54:36 - 54:41)
of smeargle photobombing (54:39 - 54:44)
the the card (54:41 - 54:44)
i mean the secret of adhesion is less (54:47 - 54:51)
the adhesive used and more that the (54:49 - 54:56)
surface that it is being adhered to yes (54:51 - 54:56)
adhesives 101 take my college course (54:56 - 55:02)
[Laughter] (55:00 - 55:05)
i'm trying to read (55:02 - 55:05)
the i don't understand (55:06 - 55:11)
except for pokemon with a rule box (55:08 - 55:13)
what's what is a rule box (55:11 - 55:16)
is that what are we looking at this page (55:13 - 55:18)
yeah read the what's the full sentence (55:16 - 55:20)
that you're trying to say this pokemon (55:18 - 55:22)
can use the attacks of any basic pokemon (55:20 - 55:23)
in your discard pile except for a (55:22 - 55:26)
pokemon with a rule box (55:23 - 55:28)
pokemon v pokemon gx accessory have rule (55:26 - 55:30)
boxes (55:28 - 55:33)
yeah a roblox is um it's it's (55:30 - 55:35)
usually at the bottom of the card and (55:33 - 55:38)
it's outlined with like a red line (55:35 - 55:40)
and those are very specific like (55:38 - 55:42)
one-time use moves (55:40 - 55:44)
and so there's (55:42 - 55:46)
no no no a rule boxes says something (55:44 - 55:49)
like if you knock out a vmax pokemon (55:46 - 55:52)
it's three prizes not one or something (55:49 - 55:53)
like that but where there's a special (55:52 - 55:54)
rule (55:53 - 55:57)
that goes for that card (55:54 - 55:59)
like there's there's those pokemon where (55:57 - 56:00)
you can only have one copy of the (55:59 - 56:02)
pokemon in the deck (56:00 - 56:05)
do y'all have like an example of one so (56:02 - 56:06)
i can look at it (56:05 - 56:08)
yes it would it would be it would be (56:06 - 56:12)
like uh this is awful for um (56:08 - 56:14)
for the audio so i have origin form (56:12 - 56:17)
dialga v star and i'm i'll hold up to (56:14 - 56:20)
the camera here so see how the bottom (56:17 - 56:23)
move is is boxed out (56:20 - 56:26)
so you cannot ditto cannot use the move (56:23 - 56:29)
star chronos which is 220 damage because (56:26 - 56:34)
it's a v star power it's a specific rule (56:29 - 56:34)
but what it's talking about is what's (56:34 - 56:39)
under that in the yellow where it says v (56:36 - 56:40)
star (56:39 - 56:43)
what is that that yellow say v star (56:40 - 56:46)
power what i'm confused about is is the (56:43 - 56:47)
wording (56:46 - 56:50)
no no look hold that card back up there (56:47 - 56:51)
sir (56:50 - 56:52)
greg (56:51 - 56:54)
do you see where his thumb is there's a (56:52 - 56:56)
little yellow and it has like an (56:54 - 56:59)
additional rule in text yeah printed (56:56 - 57:01)
what does that rule in text printed say (56:59 - 57:03)
that says if knocked out your opponent (57:01 - 57:07)
takes two prize cards that is a rule box (57:03 - 57:09)
so what this is saying is (57:07 - 57:12)
the way i'm reading this is it can't use (57:09 - 57:14)
attacks (57:12 - 57:17)
from pokemon that have a rule box from (57:14 - 57:19)
cards that have that little box (57:17 - 57:21)
nothing on that card that you just (57:19 - 57:25)
showed ditto could use correct (57:21 - 57:27)
well this is this is a v star pokemon it (57:25 - 57:30)
can only use attacks from basic pokemon (57:27 - 57:32)
right i mean yeah (57:30 - 57:34)
but like if it said basic or whatever at (57:32 - 57:37)
the top and it but if it has a rule box (57:34 - 57:39)
at the end it can't use any attacks from (57:37 - 57:42)
that from that card just that that card (57:39 - 57:44)
is off limits if it has that little (57:42 - 57:47)
thing in the lower right hand corner (57:44 - 57:47)
i'm glad we got there (57:50 - 57:54)
wording matters like yeah yeah (57:54 - 57:59)
where i read some of these cards i'm (57:58 - 58:00)
like (57:59 - 58:02)
what the heck are you that's why i like (58:00 - 58:05)
um over quill on the in the tcg is (58:02 - 58:07)
called uh hissuian over quill even (58:05 - 58:10)
though like overquilt can only be has (58:07 - 58:11)
they have to have the word in there (58:10 - 58:14)
because right of rules (58:11 - 58:17)
uh otherwise people would be like well (58:14 - 58:19)
the quail fish can evolve regular coke (58:17 - 58:21)
fish can evolve into overquilt because (58:19 - 58:22)
there's no and then it's like no you (58:21 - 58:24)
have to like only (58:22 - 58:27)
a suit yeah it's right yeah yeah (58:24 - 58:29)
silly (58:27 - 58:30)
um (58:29 - 58:33)
okay pokemon home is here (58:30 - 58:37)
it is i i i said this earlier i i think (58:33 - 58:39)
i said this the other day on uh when i (58:37 - 58:41)
was serving on twitch (58:39 - 58:44)
man the pokemon company (58:41 - 58:47)
is is one of (58:44 - 58:49)
i know we spent we look (58:47 - 58:52)
back up beep beep beep beep we spent 30 (58:49 - 58:53)
minutes (58:52 - 58:55)
talking about (58:53 - 58:58)
niantic's communication over 50 cents (58:55 - 58:59)
i want to remind everyone we had a (58:58 - 59:01)
30-minute conversation regarding 50 (58:59 - 59:03)
cents (59:01 - 59:06)
why does that matter (59:03 - 59:07)
let it proceed (59:06 - 59:10)
30 minute conversations about no sense (59:07 - 59:12)
it's true that's true i'm i'm saying (59:10 - 59:14)
maybe it's not niantic maybe it's just (59:12 - 59:16)
the pokemon company i mean the pokemon (59:14 - 59:17)
company is wild because they're (59:16 - 59:19)
communicating the pokemon companies (59:17 - 59:21)
let's not pretend not we all know (59:19 - 59:23)
niantic is bad communication but the (59:21 - 59:26)
pokemon company's communication is also (59:23 - 59:28)
incredibly terrible i want to lay out an (59:26 - 59:31)
example they announced this game (59:28 - 59:34)
called pokemon sleep (59:31 - 59:37)
before the pandemic i don't know her (59:34 - 59:39)
they also at the same time announced a (59:37 - 59:43)
game called detective pikachu for switch (59:39 - 59:45)
still we know nothing about these two (59:43 - 59:47)
games (59:45 - 59:48)
last week (59:47 - 59:51)
they tweeted put out a press release (59:48 - 59:54)
uh an official press release saying (59:51 - 59:57)
pokemon home 2.0 is coming (59:54 - 60:00)
in the upcoming weeks those were the (59:57 - 60:01)
exact words (60:00 - 60:04)
upcoming weeks then (60:01 - 60:05)
four days later (60:04 - 60:08)
not even a full week four days later (60:05 - 60:10)
they're like in two days it will be (60:08 - 60:12)
ready (60:10 - 60:16)
how do you go from announcing two games (60:12 - 60:18)
and then not talking about them for two (60:16 - 60:20)
plus years to then putting out a press (60:18 - 60:23)
release saying in a couple weeks we are (60:20 - 60:25)
updating this (60:23 - 60:27)
and then being like ah nah it's actually (60:25 - 60:29)
less than a week or just it's it's here (60:27 - 60:33)
now it's in like two days like (60:29 - 60:34)
why why didn't you say later this week (60:33 - 60:35)
why did you say in a couple days why (60:34 - 60:37)
didn't you say like by the end of the (60:35 - 60:39)
month there's so many different ways you (60:37 - 60:41)
could have phrased because they learned (60:39 - 60:43)
their lesson from pokemon sleep sleep (60:41 - 60:45)
and detective people on the switch they (60:43 - 60:46)
were like oh wait we promised that we (60:45 - 60:48)
couldn't deliver they got it within the (60:46 - 60:50)
time frame true (60:48 - 60:52)
what time frame a couple of weeks within (60:50 - 60:55)
a couple weeks within a couple weeks it (60:52 - 60:57)
was within a couple weeks (60:55 - 60:58)
like (60:57 - 61:00)
that's like the least of our concerns (60:58 - 61:03)
it's just their communication is so all (61:00 - 61:05)
over the place (61:03 - 61:08)
like yeah in one instance you're like ah (61:05 - 61:10)
we're working on these games no they're (61:08 - 61:11)
gone and then in another instance you're (61:10 - 61:13)
like ah well maybe in the next like two (61:11 - 61:15)
months this will be updated nah it's (61:13 - 61:17)
it's here now it's right tomorrow i mean (61:15 - 61:21)
elk is on the ball right (61:17 - 61:21)
it's just this company is wild when it (61:21 - 61:26)
comes to communication (61:24 - 61:28)
new somebody on the pokemon home team (61:26 - 61:32)
has a calendar and yeah (61:28 - 61:34)
but but also i mean have you noticed (61:32 - 61:37)
because this has come to mind we're like (61:34 - 61:39)
six months out from scarlett and violet (61:37 - 61:41)
and we have nothing (61:39 - 61:43)
nothing (61:41 - 61:45)
i i'm pretty sure with sword and shield (61:43 - 61:47)
we were we're at the point where we had (61:45 - 61:49)
uh the (61:47 - 61:51)
we knew the plot line is sort of by this (61:49 - 61:54)
point we'd know but we had galerin uh (61:51 - 61:55)
far-fetched (61:54 - 61:56)
scooting around the screen at this point (61:55 - 61:58)
i think we all said obstagoon at this (61:56 - 62:00)
point for uh sword and shield and like (61:58 - 62:02)
the emperor and stuff there was that (62:00 - 62:05)
there's a stand for our next 24 hours (62:02 - 62:08)
stare at a beach stream for one pokemon (62:05 - 62:09)
to come out of the water and go back in (62:08 - 62:13)
having said that let me also say (62:09 - 62:15)
from my and i know you guys don't share (62:13 - 62:17)
this from my perspective i'd much rather (62:15 - 62:19)
them say absolutely nothing more until (62:17 - 62:21)
the day that the games come out so that (62:19 - 62:24)
we can be wonderfully surprised by (62:21 - 62:25)
everything (62:24 - 62:27)
i mean i don't i don't mind that i would (62:25 - 62:31)
i would actually probably um (62:27 - 62:33)
put money down that (62:31 - 62:34)
we we would get an announcement (62:33 - 62:38)
relatively soon as it's almost time for (62:34 - 62:39)
nationals (62:38 - 62:42)
and then nationals leads into (62:39 - 62:44)
um worlds so (62:42 - 62:46)
although there are no nationals anymore (62:44 - 62:48)
it's all internationals yeah (62:46 - 62:50)
internationals sorry um (62:48 - 62:53)
which which uh i think i think that the (62:50 - 62:55)
international north america (62:53 - 62:57)
international tournament is a week after (62:55 - 62:59)
the milwaukee tournament the milwaukee (62:57 - 63:00)
tournament is in less than a month at (62:59 - 63:03)
this point so yeah i would i would wager (63:00 - 63:04)
to bet we would get something in the (63:03 - 63:08)
next month based on uh the international (63:04 - 63:10)
north america tournament (63:08 - 63:12)
i i can't imagine they're saving (63:10 - 63:15)
everything for worlds but (63:12 - 63:18)
um in the past like uh you know when we (63:15 - 63:20)
were at the dc uh world tournament will (63:18 - 63:21)
that's when they showed all the (63:20 - 63:23)
competitive stuff they showed like room (63:21 - 63:25)
service and like you can't fake out a (63:23 - 63:28)
dynamax pokemon and and all that stuff (63:25 - 63:30)
which is like really exciting and then (63:28 - 63:32)
like at another worlds they showed (63:30 - 63:33)
crawler (63:32 - 63:34)
and then at another worlds i think they (63:33 - 63:37)
showed like a new mega they do show (63:34 - 63:38)
stuff at worlds when it comes to this (63:37 - 63:40)
stuff but usually by then we have a (63:38 - 63:42)
trailer or two (63:40 - 63:45)
uh before it even gets to worlds but hey (63:42 - 63:47)
look they they they (63:45 - 63:49)
they did a lot more promotion for sun (63:47 - 63:51)
and moon (63:49 - 63:52)
some people loved that some people hated (63:51 - 63:54)
that compared to sword and shield (63:52 - 63:56)
um (63:54 - 63:59)
and they (63:56 - 64:02)
tried to do a good job at keeping (63:59 - 64:04)
everything a secret for x and y and that (64:02 - 64:07)
didn't really work out at all (64:04 - 64:07)
especially with that one dude who was (64:08 - 64:12)
like posting on instagram and then his (64:10 - 64:16)
instagram magically got deleted (64:12 - 64:16)
they got sued and taken to jail and now (64:16 - 64:21)
they now they slave and the wayfarer app (64:18 - 64:23)
trying to approve gyms (64:21 - 64:24)
yeah (64:23 - 64:26)
i think they were canadian too i don't (64:24 - 64:27)
even think they were (64:26 - 64:30)
uh they have do they got jails in canada (64:27 - 64:32)
yes (64:30 - 64:34)
they have jails everywhere like that's (64:32 - 64:35)
not even a question (64:34 - 64:38)
uh new pokemon home update to add recent (64:35 - 64:40)
pokemon game compatibility a new update (64:38 - 64:43)
to pokemon home version 2.0 will be (64:40 - 64:45)
arriving soon it's it's here it's here (64:43 - 64:46)
uh (64:45 - 64:48)
uh the (64:46 - 64:50)
it adds support for legends arceus (64:48 - 64:53)
brilliant diamond and shining pearl (64:50 - 64:55)
um (64:53 - 64:56)
uh these games will be mutually (64:55 - 64:58)
compatible with pokemon home you will be (64:56 - 65:00)
able to deposit and withdraw two and (64:58 - 65:01)
each of these games for example you'll (65:00 - 65:03)
be able to take a pikachu you caught in (65:01 - 65:04)
sword and shield (65:03 - 65:07)
and move it into legends (65:04 - 65:09)
or brilliant diamond shining pearl (65:07 - 65:11)
please note that uh pokemon not (65:09 - 65:13)
originally caught in those games may (65:11 - 65:16)
change a certain moves level type of (65:13 - 65:18)
pokeball they were caught into (65:16 - 65:21)
uh until now pokemon home the pokedex in (65:18 - 65:23)
pokemon home is only the national decks (65:21 - 65:26)
but starting in 2.0 the pokedex for each (65:23 - 65:28)
game will be added pokemon in your boxes (65:26 - 65:30)
in pokemon at home will be registered to (65:28 - 65:32)
their respective games of the pokedex (65:30 - 65:35)
after it is installed pokemon that (65:32 - 65:37)
aren't in the box ver (65:35 - 65:40)
after the 2.0 update uh (65:37 - 65:42)
or those that have been traded away will (65:40 - 65:43)
not be registered (65:42 - 65:45)
you can obtain stickers to edit your (65:43 - 65:47)
profile achievements for completing (65:45 - 65:50)
certain conditions (65:47 - 65:53)
uh strange balls (65:50 - 65:54)
when a pokemon is caught in pokemon (65:53 - 65:57)
brilliant diamond shining pearl sword or (65:54 - 65:58)
shield transferred into legends they (65:57 - 66:00)
will appear in a strange ball likewise (65:58 - 66:02)
if a pokemon is caught in legends and (66:00 - 66:04)
transferred to brilliant diamond shining (66:02 - 66:06)
pearl they will also appear in a strange (66:04 - 66:08)
ball when transferred to pokemon sword (66:06 - 66:10)
or shield they will appear in standard (66:08 - 66:11)
pokeballs (66:10 - 66:13)
so uh there was some miscommunication (66:11 - 66:16)
last week because that press release was (66:13 - 66:17)
very (66:16 - 66:19)
non-technical (66:17 - 66:21)
and vague there is clarification now (66:19 - 66:23)
with uh thank you to people on twitter (66:21 - 66:25)
that posted the clarification we (66:23 - 66:28)
actually now know officially (66:25 - 66:29)
because the (66:28 - 66:31)
the app is the app is updated it's here (66:29 - 66:33)
it is here (66:31 - 66:35)
so uh we'll clarify here on the show (66:33 - 66:37)
obviously for people who did not see (66:35 - 66:40)
those tweets or are not informed um (66:37 - 66:43)
the strange ball is is purely cosmetic (66:40 - 66:45)
you can't actually have a pokemon in a (66:43 - 66:48)
strange ball which is the like confusing (66:45 - 66:50)
part (66:48 - 66:53)
if the pokemon is caught in a jet ball (66:50 - 66:56)
i'll use jetball for example in arceus (66:53 - 66:58)
and move to sword and shield it will (66:56 - 66:59)
appear well sword and shield will appear (66:58 - 67:01)
in a pokeball (66:59 - 67:03)
and in brilliant diamond shiny pearl it (67:01 - 67:05)
will appear in a strange ball (67:03 - 67:07)
but in pokemon home it will say and (67:05 - 67:10)
still be in a jet ball (67:07 - 67:13)
so if you take a jet ball pikachu (67:10 - 67:15)
move it to pokemon home it will say (67:13 - 67:17)
jetball if you move it to sword and (67:15 - 67:19)
shield it will sell pokeball if you move (67:17 - 67:22)
it back to home it will go back to (67:19 - 67:24)
jetball and if you move the jetball back (67:22 - 67:25)
to (67:24 - 67:28)
legends it will still be a jetball so (67:25 - 67:31)
the worry of oh is it going to get a (67:28 - 67:32)
pokeball because it touched sword and (67:31 - 67:34)
shield (67:32 - 67:36)
is not a worry it just looks as a (67:34 - 67:39)
pokeball because sword and shield can't (67:36 - 67:40)
sword shields apparently not getting (67:39 - 67:42)
updated apparently now it's done there's (67:40 - 67:44)
dead it's a dead game (67:42 - 67:46)
they didn't do any origin marks there's (67:44 - 67:47)
no strange ball even though that seems (67:46 - 67:50)
pretty simple to implement (67:47 - 67:52)
uh (67:50 - 67:53)
sorry to this (67:52 - 67:56)
there's there's still probably seven (67:53 - 67:57)
people listening to this podcast being (67:56 - 67:59)
like i'm waiting for those last 200 (67:57 - 68:01)
pokemon (67:59 - 68:04)
it ain't happening (68:01 - 68:04)
they're going into violet (68:05 - 68:08)
so that that worry that that worry is is (68:08 - 68:12)
is (68:11 - 68:14)
cleared up (68:12 - 68:16)
you can safely take your legends pokemon (68:14 - 68:18)
move it to sword and shield move it back (68:16 - 68:19)
and you're not going to lose the (68:18 - 68:21)
pokeball it's in the other thing is the (68:19 - 68:23)
alpha mark (68:21 - 68:25)
if you the pokemon home did update so if (68:23 - 68:27)
you if you caught like an alpha spirit (68:25 - 68:30)
tomb and you move it into pokemon home (68:27 - 68:32)
there will actually be the alpha symbol (68:30 - 68:34)
in pokemon home (68:32 - 68:35)
and then if you move it to sword and (68:34 - 68:37)
shield it will appear regular move it (68:35 - 68:39)
back to pokemon home the apple mark will (68:37 - 68:41)
still be there move it back to legends (68:39 - 68:43)
it will still be alpha (68:41 - 68:45)
so you're you're good there (68:43 - 68:49)
there there is (68:45 - 68:49)
um you can (68:49 - 68:53)
take an alpha (68:51 - 68:56)
mime junior i saw this on twitter (68:53 - 68:59)
alpha mime jr move it into sword and (68:56 - 69:00)
shield (68:59 - 69:03)
evolve it to a mr rhyme (69:00 - 69:06)
move it to pokemon home and have an (69:03 - 69:09)
alpha mr rhyme that will forever live in (69:06 - 69:11)
pokemon home because you can no longer (69:09 - 69:13)
move it back to legends to see that it's (69:11 - 69:15)
alpha but it may be an alpha in scarlet (69:13 - 69:18)
violet if mr rhyme is in scarlet violet (69:15 - 69:21)
yeah that's true that's true can i it (69:18 - 69:22)
won't be (69:21 - 69:23)
make one (69:22 - 69:25)
statement (69:23 - 69:27)
to i i want to make a statement to some (69:25 - 69:29)
of the many commenters (69:27 - 69:30)
that we had on (69:29 - 69:32)
our last program because i made the (69:30 - 69:35)
mistake of reading some commentary oh no (69:32 - 69:37)
bad but bad i think i think the only way (69:35 - 69:40)
that i want to phrase it in in a gentle (69:37 - 69:42)
and polite way (69:40 - 69:44)
and i just want you to to try to listen (69:42 - 69:47)
and ingest the words that i'm saying (69:44 - 69:50)
i don't do that yeah i know you don't (69:47 - 69:52)
but (69:50 - 69:54)
greg i think greg will understand with (69:52 - 69:56)
compassion and kindness that these words (69:54 - 69:59)
are coming from my mouth (69:56 - 70:01)
just because (69:59 - 70:03)
something worked some way (70:01 - 70:06)
previously (70:03 - 70:07)
does not (70:06 - 70:09)
guarantee or mean (70:07 - 70:14)
that it will work that way the next time (70:09 - 70:17)
correct that's all i want to say (70:14 - 70:20)
that's all i want to say (70:17 - 70:21)
just because they did it that way the (70:20 - 70:22)
last time (70:21 - 70:24)
doesn't mean they're going to do it that (70:22 - 70:27)
way the next time (70:24 - 70:27)
yeah (70:27 - 70:29)
uh this is (70:28 - 70:31)
you know i i recently talked about that (70:29 - 70:34)
on the bonus podcast with bobby (70:31 - 70:36)
i'm not a premium subscriber so i don't (70:34 - 70:37)
know what you're saying about those (70:36 - 70:38)
things (70:37 - 70:39)
but (70:38 - 70:41)
that was a thing and i brought up (70:39 - 70:43)
monster hunter and how (70:41 - 70:46)
from generations ultimate to world they (70:43 - 70:48)
changed so many mechanics and monster (70:46 - 70:50)
hunter fans were upset (70:48 - 70:53)
because like hey that's not how it used (70:50 - 70:54)
to be (70:53 - 70:55)
but what you know what's funny too is (70:54 - 70:57)
like monster hunter changes mechanics (70:55 - 71:00)
with literally every generation yeah (70:57 - 71:01)
yeah (71:00 - 71:03)
i think i think of like the final (71:01 - 71:05)
fantasy series how many times all the (71:03 - 71:08)
time they change like 15 is so different (71:05 - 71:10)
than nine that's so different than 12 (71:08 - 71:11)
that's so (71:10 - 71:14)
so different than one (71:11 - 71:14)
i mean yeah (71:15 - 71:18)
i'm glad that can why you can look at (71:18 - 71:23)
past performance as a predictor of (71:20 - 71:24)
future (71:23 - 71:27)
it is not a guarantee (71:24 - 71:30)
especially with the pokemon company (71:27 - 71:33)
it's it's it's interesting that a home (71:30 - 71:35)
is working (71:33 - 71:38)
uh because according to the data miners (71:35 - 71:40)
brilliant diamond shotting pearl was a (71:38 - 71:43)
hot mess code wise because it was built (71:40 - 71:45)
in unity (71:43 - 71:47)
and um sword and shield legends let's go (71:45 - 71:50)
pikachu let's go eevee etc was all built (71:47 - 71:53)
using game freak's in-house engine (71:50 - 71:54)
um (71:53 - 71:56)
and now now there there were people when (71:54 - 71:58)
i i made a video explaining the the data (71:56 - 72:00)
miner tweets just to be like (71:58 - 72:03)
this is the this is the dumbed-down (72:00 - 72:04)
explanation of (72:03 - 72:07)
what the data miner is saying (72:04 - 72:09)
um which is funny because i think (72:07 - 72:10)
somebody commented on the video and was (72:09 - 72:12)
like (72:10 - 72:14)
this isn't technical at all it's like (72:12 - 72:15)
yeah that's the point of the video it's (72:14 - 72:17)
supposed to be like really dumbed down (72:15 - 72:19)
of like hey this might not work here are (72:17 - 72:21)
some possibilities (72:19 - 72:22)
hopefully pokemon home comes out sooner (72:21 - 72:24)
rather than later (72:22 - 72:24)
uh (72:24 - 72:27)
so pokemon go is also built in unity (72:24 - 72:30)
and the thing about pokemon go is when (72:27 - 72:33)
it sends a pokemon to pokemon home (72:30 - 72:35)
it actually deletes the pokemon in (72:33 - 72:38)
pokemon go and then it creates (72:35 - 72:40)
a new pokemon based off that pokemon and (72:38 - 72:43)
sends it over (72:40 - 72:43)
transporters yeah it's teleportation (72:43 - 72:49)
uh so the the (72:47 - 72:53)
based on how pokemon go did it that was (72:49 - 72:55)
kind of maybe the like oh maybe that's (72:53 - 72:57)
the solution in brilliant diamond (72:55 - 72:58)
shining pearl because they're both based (72:57 - 73:00)
in unity is brilliant diamond shining (72:58 - 73:02)
pro going to fake it like pokemon go (73:00 - 73:03)
fakes it and is it going to delete the (73:02 - 73:06)
pokemon that you caught create a new one (73:03 - 73:08)
send it over to home (73:06 - 73:11)
and then like solve the like coding (73:08 - 73:13)
mismatch issue that the data miner was (73:11 - 73:14)
suggesting (73:13 - 73:16)
uh for whatever (73:14 - 73:19)
they they did it though they they fixed (73:16 - 73:21)
it so these games communicate and you go (73:19 - 73:22)
back and forth (73:21 - 73:23)
so you can take a pokemon for brilliant (73:22 - 73:25)
diamonds send it to legends send it back (73:23 - 73:26)
to brilliant time and send it to sword (73:25 - 73:28)
and shield send it back to legends send (73:26 - 73:29)
it (73:28 - 73:31)
they they did it they fixed it (73:29 - 73:32)
um (73:31 - 73:34)
and it's working there are still some (73:32 - 73:36)
issues right now like (73:34 - 73:38)
somehow spinda got messed up so any (73:36 - 73:40)
spindas you caught in brilliant diamond (73:38 - 73:42)
shining pearl are stuck in brilliant (73:40 - 73:44)
diamond shining pearl again the (73:42 - 73:46)
dataminer said that the reason it's (73:44 - 73:49)
stuck is because the coding database for (73:46 - 73:50)
that is just backwards and they have to (73:49 - 73:52)
flip it (73:50 - 73:53)
um (73:52 - 73:55)
i don't know how that happens i don't (73:53 - 73:56)
know how a whole string of code is (73:55 - 73:58)
suddenly backwards (73:56 - 74:01)
and it's always spinda (73:58 - 74:02)
mean that's i don't know what that means (74:01 - 74:04)
either it's not it's a technical term (74:02 - 74:07)
there's also the ninjas ninketa issue (74:04 - 74:09)
which happened in sword and shield so (74:07 - 74:11)
pokemon home has it built in where it (74:09 - 74:12)
doesn't like it tries to find the (74:11 - 74:15)
duplicates and then says like oh this is (74:12 - 74:17)
a clone this is a duplicate therefore it (74:15 - 74:18)
cannot exist (74:17 - 74:21)
and this to prevent hacking well because (74:18 - 74:24)
like because ninketa splits into two (74:21 - 74:27)
pokemon in sword and shield pokemon home (74:24 - 74:29)
would be like oh this is a duplicate so (74:27 - 74:31)
it's not real but it it that's house (74:29 - 74:34)
that's how it evolves it splits itself (74:31 - 74:36)
um so they had to fix that they did fix (74:34 - 74:38)
that in sword and shield but that same (74:36 - 74:40)
exact issue now exists in brilliant (74:38 - 74:41)
diamond shining pearl that they fixed (74:40 - 74:43)
like two years ago so they have to fix (74:41 - 74:44)
that again (74:43 - 74:46)
um (74:44 - 74:49)
so that's like (74:46 - 74:49)
how did you not learn this how how did (74:49 - 74:52)
like (74:52 - 74:54)
it's kind of like (74:52 - 74:55)
it's kind of like niantic like (74:54 - 74:57)
forgetting to turn on and off of shiny (74:55 - 74:59)
it's like you we just had this problem (74:57 - 75:03)
two years ago it's the same problem but (74:59 - 75:05)
like put it on the database like put it (75:03 - 75:07)
on the big (75:05 - 75:08)
big board (75:07 - 75:11)
number of days since spinda has been (75:08 - 75:12)
messed up (75:11 - 75:13)
yeah (75:12 - 75:15)
it's always the same pokemon like it's (75:13 - 75:17)
it's like spinda (75:15 - 75:20)
there's there is also i wanna i wanna (75:17 - 75:22)
i'm trying to think of all the issues so (75:20 - 75:24)
we can communicate them here (75:22 - 75:26)
if you if you i i can't remember which (75:24 - 75:28)
form of giratina it is (75:26 - 75:29)
but (75:28 - 75:31)
bear with me here (75:29 - 75:33)
oh i saw this (75:31 - 75:36)
in legends you can't have shiny (75:33 - 75:38)
legendary pokemon because all of the (75:36 - 75:40)
legendary and mythical pokemon in (75:38 - 75:44)
legends are shiny locked correct but now (75:40 - 75:47)
that pokemon home is working (75:44 - 75:50)
you could take a shiny giratina (75:47 - 75:52)
from sword and shield dynamax adventure (75:50 - 75:54)
or whatever or pokemon go it doesn't (75:52 - 75:56)
matter like (75:54 - 75:58)
move it into legends and that that would (75:56 - 75:59)
be legal (75:58 - 76:02)
so prior to pokemon home coming out (75:59 - 76:04)
people would hack in (76:02 - 76:07)
shiny versions of the legendaries like (76:04 - 76:09)
palkia (76:07 - 76:11)
the thunderous etc (76:09 - 76:13)
and before (76:11 - 76:15)
the home update if you had a shiny (76:13 - 76:18)
giratina and it used i believe it was (76:15 - 76:21)
shadow force i it's the snake geratina (76:18 - 76:23)
it's not the one with the feet no feet (76:21 - 76:25)
no feet geratina would use shadow force (76:23 - 76:28)
peter is origin form yes no no feat (76:25 - 76:30)
geratina would use shadow force and your (76:28 - 76:32)
game would crash (76:30 - 76:33)
and the reason the game would crash (76:32 - 76:36)
according to the data miner was because (76:33 - 76:38)
they never put that animation in for the (76:36 - 76:39)
shiny (76:38 - 76:42)
because you couldn't get shiny legendary (76:39 - 76:44)
pokemon (76:42 - 76:46)
so because the shiny would do that (76:44 - 76:49)
animation there was no animation for it (76:46 - 76:51)
to do (76:49 - 76:54)
so therefore the game would crash (76:51 - 76:57)
now that you can legally move in shiny (76:54 - 77:00)
no feet giratina (76:57 - 77:02)
they never fix that that issue in (77:00 - 77:05)
legends so your game will crash so just (77:02 - 77:06)
a fair warning (77:05 - 77:07)
if for whatever reason you're still (77:06 - 77:09)
playing legends and you want to move (77:07 - 77:11)
your shiny guarantee into legends i (77:09 - 77:12)
don't know why you would want to you (77:11 - 77:15)
can't really do anything with it yeah (77:12 - 77:16)
there's not like i (77:15 - 77:18)
but if you do move your shiny no feet (77:16 - 77:20)
guarantee the legends and then you do (77:18 - 77:22)
shadow force your game will crash and (77:20 - 77:24)
who knows if they will fix that that's (77:22 - 77:26)
just a (77:24 - 77:26)
that's just something that exists (77:27 - 77:31)
uh (77:29 - 77:33)
i don't know if this is an issue with (77:31 - 77:35)
pokemon home (77:33 - 77:37)
being uh updated or if this was just an (77:35 - 77:39)
always an issue with pokemon brilliant (77:37 - 77:40)
diamond shining pearl but i took a (77:39 - 77:42)
pokemon from sword and shield with pokey (77:40 - 77:43)
russ (77:42 - 77:45)
and i moved it into brilliant diamond (77:43 - 77:46)
and shining pearl to give those pokemon (77:45 - 77:48)
in that game pokeris (77:46 - 77:51)
and the pokeris symbol the little happy (77:48 - 77:55)
face isn't centered in the square (77:51 - 77:58)
and i don't think it's it has nothing to (77:55 - 77:59)
do probably with pokemon home just the (77:58 - 78:01)
fact i could move it over but i just (77:59 - 78:03)
thought it was really funny that like (78:01 - 78:07)
for a company called i love computer (78:03 - 78:09)
animation (78:07 - 78:12)
they they couldn't even get this the (78:09 - 78:13)
smiley face (78:12 - 78:15)
that's not an animation yeah that's a (78:13 - 78:17)
that's a still picture that's a still (78:15 - 78:18)
one (78:17 - 78:20)
let's get to work on arceus we need game (78:18 - 78:23)
freak to work on brilliant diamond chips (78:20 - 78:25)
that way everything will be (78:23 - 78:27)
uh together (78:25 - 78:30)
um what other weird things happened with (78:27 - 78:32)
this stuff uh (78:30 - 78:35)
there is the mystery gifts now for the (78:32 - 78:38)
oh the other thing just in case anyone (78:35 - 78:42)
if if you have a a shiny rowlet from (78:38 - 78:45)
sword and shield or sun and moon or (78:42 - 78:47)
pokemon go that that doesn't exist (78:45 - 78:50)
pokemon go scratch that last sentence if (78:47 - 78:52)
you have a shiny rowlet in sword and (78:50 - 78:53)
shield for example (78:52 - 78:55)
you move it into legends (78:53 - 78:57)
you evolve it (78:55 - 79:01)
it will evolve into his decidueye (78:57 - 79:02)
because you're evolving it in that (79:01 - 79:03)
region (79:02 - 79:06)
so if you want a (79:03 - 79:08)
sui and decidueye you can take a rowlet (79:06 - 79:11)
from sword and shield move it on over (79:08 - 79:13)
evolve it (79:11 - 79:15)
and then i guess it will be stuck there (79:13 - 79:17)
or be stuck in home because you can't (79:15 - 79:19)
move it back (79:17 - 79:19)
happens (79:20 - 79:25)
yeah you can it okay so for my ribbon (79:21 - 79:26)
people (79:25 - 79:28)
i don't know where you at but hello (79:26 - 79:31)
ribbon people it seems that all of the (79:28 - 79:33)
ribbons are exactly south (79:31 - 79:35)
uh are exactly the same in brilliant (79:33 - 79:37)
time and shining pearl (79:35 - 79:39)
so if you're doing a ribbon quest you (79:37 - 79:40)
could (79:39 - 79:42)
for the most part skip (79:40 - 79:45)
regular diamond pearl and platinum (79:42 - 79:48)
and go into gen 5 which has no ribbons (79:45 - 79:49)
and then go into gen 6 get all your (79:48 - 79:51)
ribbons in gen six go to gen seven get (79:49 - 79:52)
all your ribbons in gen seven go to (79:51 - 79:54)
sword and shield get your ribbons and (79:52 - 79:55)
support and shield then move to (79:54 - 79:56)
brilliant time and shining pearl and get (79:55 - 79:59)
the room the ribbons you are missing (79:56 - 80:02)
so that that does work the the exclusive (79:59 - 80:04)
the the brand new ribbon and brilliant (80:02 - 80:05)
diamond shining pearl which is the (80:04 - 80:09)
sparkle star star sprinkling star (80:05 - 80:12)
spangled ribbon or whatever it's called (80:09 - 80:12)
if you get that on a pokemon and move it (80:13 - 80:16)
into sword and shield sword and shield (80:15 - 80:19)
does not see that ribbon (80:16 - 80:22)
but you can still get it so like if you (80:19 - 80:24)
had if you had a kyogre in sword and (80:22 - 80:26)
shield moved it to brilliant diamond (80:24 - 80:28)
shining pearl you could get all of those (80:26 - 80:29)
ribbons on it in berlin diamond shining (80:28 - 80:31)
pro move it back to sword and shield it (80:29 - 80:33)
would have all the ribbons but that new (80:31 - 80:34)
one (80:33 - 80:36)
so it's kind of like the ball issue it (80:34 - 80:38)
just doesn't show it but in pokemon home (80:36 - 80:40)
it will have it (80:38 - 80:42)
i think though if if you are doing a (80:40 - 80:44)
ribbon thing i think it's actually (80:42 - 80:47)
better to skip those original games (80:44 - 80:49)
because i think in order to get the star (80:47 - 80:51)
spangled ribbon it's not called i don't (80:49 - 80:53)
know what it's called um it's the new (80:51 - 80:54)
one (80:53 - 80:56)
in order to get that one you have to do (80:54 - 80:57)
all the contests (80:56 - 81:00)
so the brilliant diamond shining pearl (80:57 - 81:02)
doesn't acknowledge the ribbons that you (81:00 - 81:04)
got in the older game it only (81:02 - 81:06)
acknowledges the work you do in the (81:04 - 81:08)
contest that you're doing in those games (81:06 - 81:10)
so you're pretty much doing contests (81:08 - 81:11)
twice (81:10 - 81:14)
um so you're almost better off just (81:11 - 81:17)
skipping it i mean the contest in (81:14 - 81:18)
brilliant diamond shine pearl aren't (81:17 - 81:20)
terribly hard (81:18 - 81:22)
it's just you have to do it again (81:20 - 81:24)
um i think that's everything i think (81:22 - 81:26)
that i think that's all the (81:24 - 81:27)
the (81:26 - 81:29)
weird stuff (81:27 - 81:30)
for (81:29 - 81:31)
home (81:30 - 81:33)
2.0 (81:31 - 81:33)
is it worth 16 (81:35 - 81:37)
update (81:36 - 81:39)
i'd still think no (81:37 - 81:42)
but i'm paying it so whatever yeah me (81:39 - 81:44)
too i got way too many pokemon to weed (81:42 - 81:45)
through (81:44 - 81:48)
uh i believe (81:45 - 81:50)
you still get like the 30 for free (81:48 - 81:52)
right you get like 30 you get one box (81:50 - 81:54)
for free and you can move pokemon in (81:52 - 81:56)
between (81:54 - 81:57)
[Music] (81:56 - 81:59)
if you're a hardcore collector i mean (81:57 - 82:01)
it's your only option (81:59 - 82:04)
if if you're not hardcore enough (82:01 - 82:08)
and you don't really there's really (82:04 - 82:10)
it's still hard to okay here's the it's (82:08 - 82:11)
still hard (82:10 - 82:13)
i think why i still say no is pokemon (82:11 - 82:15)
home worth 16 (82:13 - 82:18)
is because you're still in a situation (82:15 - 82:20)
where none of these games really (82:18 - 82:23)
actually communicate with each other (82:20 - 82:25)
like yeah you could you could take a (82:23 - 82:26)
kyogre from sword and shield and move it (82:25 - 82:28)
in a brilliant diamond shining pearl (82:26 - 82:29)
that's cool (82:28 - 82:31)
yeah you could take a pikachu (82:29 - 82:33)
from let's go pikachu let's go eevee and (82:31 - 82:35)
move it to arceus (82:33 - 82:37)
and yeah i guess that's cool (82:35 - 82:40)
you can't really do anything with it (82:37 - 82:42)
but like (82:40 - 82:45)
these pokemon still get stuck (82:42 - 82:47)
right like you can get you you can you (82:45 - 82:49)
can't do anything with your mr rhyme you (82:47 - 82:50)
can't do anything with your suit and (82:49 - 82:52)
decidueye (82:50 - 82:53)
you literally can't even do anything (82:52 - 82:55)
with an incineroar and then cinema is (82:53 - 82:56)
not even a new pokemon but like (82:55 - 82:58)
incineroar can't go to any of these (82:56 - 82:59)
games (82:58 - 83:00)
so (82:59 - 83:03)
i i do think it would get it gets better (83:00 - 83:05)
with like (83:03 - 83:07)
scarlet and violet (83:05 - 83:09)
like like for example if scarlet and (83:07 - 83:13)
violet has gastrodon (83:09 - 83:13)
you can you can at least go like okay (83:13 - 83:18)
the gastrodon can come from legends (83:15 - 83:19)
which is cool (83:18 - 83:21)
so the i guess best case scenario is (83:19 - 83:23)
gastrodon in (83:21 - 83:26)
um (83:23 - 83:26)
heavy well heavy balls probably (83:26 - 83:32)
heavy ball or what's the wha (83:28 - 83:32)
gigaton ball (83:33 - 83:37)
can come from legends (83:35 - 83:39)
it can go into brilliant diamond shining (83:37 - 83:41)
pearl you can get a bunch of ribbons on (83:39 - 83:42)
it (83:41 - 83:44)
you can send it over to sword and shield (83:42 - 83:46)
you can get a bunch of ribbons on it (83:44 - 83:48)
there and then ideally you can set it in (83:46 - 83:51)
scarlet and violet and ideally (83:48 - 83:53)
it would have all of the ribbons from (83:51 - 83:56)
those two games plus it would be in the (83:53 - 83:58)
the gigaton ball from legends and it (83:56 - 84:00)
could move freely between those four (83:58 - 84:02)
games that would be like the best (84:00 - 84:05)
situation for a pokemon but you're (84:02 - 84:07)
you're you're already limited by that (84:05 - 84:10)
pokemon has to exist in gen 4 earlier (84:07 - 84:12)
and also has to appear in sword and (84:10 - 84:13)
shield (84:12 - 84:15)
so like b drill would be a terrible (84:13 - 84:17)
example because beedrill does beedrill (84:15 - 84:19)
does appear in brilliant diamond shiny (84:17 - 84:21)
pearl but doesn't appear in sword and (84:19 - 84:22)
shield (84:21 - 84:24)
but i guess the bidro could come from (84:22 - 84:26)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee i (84:24 - 84:29)
it's (84:26 - 84:29)
i ideally (84:29 - 84:33)
ideally is the word of the show ideally (84:31 - 84:34)
it would get better when more pokemon (84:33 - 84:36)
games come out (84:34 - 84:38)
i suppose (84:36 - 84:41)
i mean the the promise is that now that (84:38 - 84:43)
home exists maybe they'll start (84:41 - 84:47)
designing games with home in mind true (84:43 - 84:49)
true (84:47 - 84:50)
maybe (84:49 - 84:53)
maybe big maybe (84:50 - 84:53)
uh maybe the pokemon sleep has something (84:54 - 84:59)
to do with pokemon home oh there you go (84:55 - 85:01)
uh question (84:59 - 85:03)
question of the week there are questions (85:01 - 85:05)
just ready for asking (85:03 - 85:08)
and you're going to ask us a few (85:05 - 85:10)
[Music] (85:08 - 85:12)
we have like a lot i think a lot of (85:10 - 85:15)
youtube stuff (85:12 - 85:15)
uh brandon sent in the uh pokemon (85:17 - 85:23)
go stuff (85:20 - 85:24)
uh (85:23 - 85:26)
so we didn't cover this but um (85:24 - 85:28)
niantic did partner with the the silph (85:26 - 85:29)
road (85:28 - 85:31)
officially yeah (85:29 - 85:32)
which (85:31 - 85:33)
when we go back to the wayfarer (85:32 - 85:35)
conversation and like organize (85:33 - 85:37)
communities we're trying to build (85:35 - 85:40)
communities together they're literally (85:37 - 85:42)
using the self-roads community feature (85:40 - 85:45)
for this like that's the partnership (85:42 - 85:47)
they're buying their silence (85:45 - 85:49)
which like makes sense like the (85:47 - 85:51)
self-road brings people together they do (85:49 - 85:53)
a bunch of research (85:51 - 85:56)
niantic frequently (85:53 - 85:57)
reads (85:56 - 86:00)
debates debating about listens to the (85:57 - 86:04)
self road but they read the self right (86:00 - 86:04)
uh (86:08 - 86:13)
this is from wrath uh in our attic (86:10 - 86:14)
channel which pokemon would you let (86:13 - 86:17)
babysit your kids (86:14 - 86:17)
children wigglytuff has like the (86:22 - 86:27)
the whole (86:24 - 86:28)
sing them to sleep those kids are gonna (86:27 - 86:30)
be out (86:28 - 86:31)
perfect (86:30 - 86:35)
literally any pokemon with hypnosis (86:31 - 86:36)
hypnosis or sing (86:35 - 86:38)
i'm going to say i'm going to say a (86:36 - 86:41)
mungus because spore can't miss it's 100 (86:38 - 86:43)
accurate (86:41 - 86:44)
i was going to say let me let me find (86:43 - 86:47)
some kind of gengar poison type (86:44 - 86:49)
yeah or like (86:47 - 86:51)
i mean gengar is good because it is (86:49 - 86:53)
poison because it's like if i have kids (86:51 - 86:55)
there's been some horrible mistakes (86:53 - 86:56)
somewhere and let's let's take care of (86:55 - 86:58)
that problem (86:56 - 87:01)
what about hear me out what about dark (86:58 - 87:05)
rides so that they have horrible names (87:01 - 87:06)
except they had the nightmares but then (87:05 - 87:07)
it's like then you've got to deal with (87:06 - 87:09)
the consequences of the nightmares when (87:07 - 87:11)
they wake up (87:09 - 87:13)
right sure (87:11 - 87:15)
so i am singing with wiggly the jiggly (87:13 - 87:18)
tough wiggly tough taking them to sleep (87:15 - 87:19)
also (87:18 - 87:21)
real squishy so the kids can't do a lot (87:19 - 87:23)
of damage (87:21 - 87:23)
although your kids greg would be perfect (87:24 - 87:28)
angels no they would not (87:26 - 87:30)
i wasn't (87:28 - 87:33)
i know i know my lineage that is not a (87:30 - 87:35)
possibility (87:33 - 87:37)
uh this is from robert off our youtube (87:35 - 87:39)
if you're watching on youtube hello hi (87:37 - 87:41)
feel free to like comment subscribe you (87:39 - 87:43)
can comment your question of the week uh (87:41 - 87:45)
the question is when ash faces leon in (87:43 - 87:47)
the anime what do you think is most (87:45 - 87:50)
beneficial ash beats leon clean leon (87:47 - 87:53)
beats ash in a close match or leon beats (87:50 - 87:56)
ash in a squash match (87:53 - 87:56)
i think the (87:59 - 88:03)
from like a dramatic standpoint it would (88:01 - 88:06)
be most (88:03 - 88:09)
dramatic and fitting how they do things (88:06 - 88:12)
is leon beats ash in a close match close (88:09 - 88:13)
match (88:12 - 88:15)
close match i mean that's like the anime (88:13 - 88:17)
thing right like they're down to the (88:15 - 88:19)
last ones they've spent everything that (88:17 - 88:21)
they have they're tired they're (88:19 - 88:23)
exhausted they're panting and they send (88:21 - 88:25)
out they're both send out their (88:23 - 88:27)
charizards (88:25 - 88:30)
but leon's can gigantomax and regular (88:27 - 88:32)
charizard can't because he was spending (88:30 - 88:34)
all that time in that valley (88:32 - 88:35)
with (88:34 - 88:37)
the other charizard you don't even know (88:35 - 88:38)
what they're doing in that valley at (88:37 - 88:40)
this point it's a charizard sanctuary (88:38 - 88:42)
they're just eating chips and watching (88:40 - 88:45)
soaps (88:42 - 88:45)
yeah there's no way it's not ash vs leon (88:45 - 88:49)
right there's no way no there's no way (88:47 - 88:50)
that's like the whole point of the (88:49 - 88:51)
series (88:50 - 88:53)
unless it's like cynthia comes in as (88:51 - 88:55)
like squish ash early on and then ashes (88:53 - 88:56)
gets to watch (88:55 - 88:57)
i think (88:56 - 89:00)
this is really the person that (88:57 - 89:02)
was it elaine that beat ash yes elaine (89:00 - 89:05)
goes and gets stomped by leon no i want (89:02 - 89:07)
to say it (89:05 - 89:08)
and then it's like (89:07 - 89:10)
uh it's uh i (89:08 - 89:13)
yeah i could i could see (89:10 - 89:16)
i i i could definitely see a situation (89:13 - 89:18)
where ash loses to elaine again which i (89:16 - 89:22)
think is acceptable i think like elaine (89:18 - 89:23)
being able to beat ash twice in a (89:22 - 89:26)
tournament would make people go wild and (89:23 - 89:28)
upset but like upset in the good way (89:26 - 89:30)
like that's the response you want you (89:28 - 89:33)
want elaine to constantly crush ash (89:30 - 89:35)
that's what you want (89:33 - 89:38)
but i could definitely see it being elan (89:35 - 89:40)
versus leon only because they both have (89:38 - 89:42)
charizard and so it would be mega (89:40 - 89:44)
charizard against gigantomax charizard (89:42 - 89:46)
and that would be cool (89:44 - 89:47)
um (89:46 - 89:50)
i think i would be more upset if ash (89:47 - 89:53)
goes if ash beats elaine finally and (89:50 - 89:55)
then ash beats leon (89:53 - 89:57)
like i i think if you're gonna make it (89:55 - 89:59)
where if you make it where ash beats (89:57 - 90:03)
elaine you're like okay ash got his (89:59 - 90:05)
victory over elaine finally because i'm (90:03 - 90:08)
pretty sure ash versus elaine like four (90:05 - 90:10)
or five times in x and y and i don't (90:08 - 90:12)
think the some of those matches i know (90:10 - 90:14)
the very first time he he fights elaine (90:12 - 90:16)
like elaine wins clean (90:14 - 90:18)
um i i don't remember if the other (90:16 - 90:19)
matches are interrupted by like team (90:18 - 90:21)
rocket and stuff (90:19 - 90:23)
um (90:21 - 90:24)
but i can't see ash beating elaine and (90:23 - 90:26)
then ash going on to beat leon there's (90:24 - 90:28)
no way (90:26 - 90:30)
but i would assume it would be close i (90:28 - 90:31)
don't think i don't think they're going (90:30 - 90:33)
to do a squash catch yeah no yeah i (90:31 - 90:36)
think it's a narrative if it's not close (90:33 - 90:38)
i mean they they already did that over (90:36 - 90:41)
multiple episodes right like (90:38 - 90:44)
they already did a squash match (90:41 - 90:46)
they've done a couple swatch squash (90:44 - 90:47)
matches with ash the first time he (90:46 - 90:50)
fights wannabe wall-e (90:47 - 90:52)
uh with squash and then the first time (90:50 - 90:54)
he fights (90:52 - 90:58)
b was like obvious squash yeah and that (90:54 - 91:00)
mettaton battle was an obvious squash so (90:58 - 91:01)
which one (91:00 - 91:04)
metapod battle metapod versus metal pond (91:01 - 91:06)
forest (91:04 - 91:08)
very early on i was just talking about (91:06 - 91:11)
squash matches but yes yeah very early (91:08 - 91:12)
on (91:11 - 91:15)
uh when is aj and assange gonna come (91:12 - 91:17)
back i wanna see that match (91:15 - 91:19)
never i wanna i wanna see that sandshrew (91:17 - 91:21)
and that pikachu finally battle each (91:19 - 91:23)
other (91:21 - 91:25)
aj discovered a lot of things about (91:23 - 91:27)
themselves (91:25 - 91:31)
in their best life in kanto (91:27 - 91:33)
yeah i i think leon wins right (91:31 - 91:35)
yeah (91:33 - 91:35)
like i don't think i predict nothing (91:36 - 91:40)
maybe i haven't i also don't finally i (91:38 - 91:42)
also don't think they give ash two (91:40 - 91:45)
champions in a row (91:42 - 91:45)
