what's up everyone welcome to the (0:31 - 0:37)
540th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:34 - 0:40)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:37 - 0:43)
with me is Bobby (0:40 - 0:46)
hey what's going on downstairs I don't (0:43 - 0:49)
know what to do (0:46 - 0:49)
uh Greg is also here I am also here I'm (0:49 - 0:55)
wearing different socks and different (0:53 - 0:57)
shoes because that's all I'm allowed to (0:55 - 0:59)
change (0:57 - 0:59)
you know yeah yeah that's true (0:59 - 1:05)
um okay here's the deal uh this is a (1:02 - 1:07)
Monday episode so we're going to talk (1:05 - 1:09)
about some Pokemon news we're obviously (1:07 - 1:10)
going to talk about scarlet and violet (1:09 - 1:12)
that is out there (1:10 - 1:14)
um but we have a mini series that will (1:12 - 1:15)
be coming out later this week Thursday (1:14 - 1:18)
Friday uh and I I figured out the (1:15 - 1:21)
structure of the miniseries oh I get I (1:18 - 1:23)
get to hear it live I'm excited you get (1:21 - 1:24)
I was gonna say I didn't get to tell (1:23 - 1:26)
Greg but I figured it out I figured it (1:24 - 1:30)
out yesterday cool I like how I'm I have (1:26 - 1:32)
so much input and say and all of the (1:30 - 1:34)
processes going into these things I just (1:32 - 1:36)
it's such a giving (1:34 - 1:38)
collaborative process we go through (1:36 - 1:40)
where you don't talk to me for an entire (1:38 - 1:42)
week like I figured it all out this is (1:40 - 1:43)
what we're doing and I hope it fits into (1:42 - 1:46)
your schedule I'm assuming so I never (1:43 - 1:50)
asked Greg I had an epiphany (1:46 - 1:50)
so uh we already Greg and I already said (1:52 - 1:57)
about maybe four four or five episodes (1:55 - 1:59)
maybe six episodes (1:57 - 2:00)
um (1:59 - 2:03)
and I I and I think the thing that Greg (2:00 - 2:05)
and I we we talked about on the show we (2:03 - 2:06)
talked about during Community Day is (2:05 - 2:08)
like how do we structure this episode (2:06 - 2:11)
these episodes if Greg goes north I go (2:08 - 2:15)
south Bobby goes east will Goes West and (2:11 - 2:16)
then you know we don't care where will (2:15 - 2:19)
goes who else never gonna talk to us (2:16 - 2:21)
about it anyway (2:19 - 2:24)
and you know it even even if we did in (2:21 - 2:27)
the order that the game wants you to (2:24 - 2:29)
because let's you know the game really (2:27 - 2:31)
wants to do it in a very specific order (2:29 - 2:34)
if we if we do it in an order that (2:31 - 2:36)
doesn't mean you The Listener is doing (2:34 - 2:37)
are doing it in that order either right (2:36 - 2:40)
because you can go wherever you want so (2:37 - 2:44)
uh the first episode will be I think uh (2:40 - 2:45)
the first episode we'll be talking about (2:44 - 2:48)
all the new Pokemon (2:45 - 2:50)
um minus post game Pokemon because we (2:48 - 2:51)
haven't talked about any of those yet (2:50 - 2:52)
there's a lot of new Pokemon we're not (2:51 - 2:53)
going to talk about them in this episode (2:52 - 2:55)
so don't worry about that if you're like (2:53 - 2:56)
I haven't seen it but you know that (2:55 - 2:58)
expectations going into that first (2:56 - 3:00)
episode then we're going to dedicate a (2:58 - 3:01)
whole a whole episode to the Titan (3:00 - 3:03)
storyline a whole episode to the team (3:01 - 3:05)
star storyline and a whole episode to (3:03 - 3:07)
the gym leader storyline (3:05 - 3:10)
um that way if you finished the Titan (3:07 - 3:13)
storyline like uh I did before (3:10 - 3:15)
everything else boom you can listen to (3:13 - 3:17)
that episode and know that (3:15 - 3:20)
nothing else is spoiled and I think (3:17 - 3:22)
I I think uh (3:20 - 3:26)
those stories are good enough told where (3:22 - 3:28)
we can you want to kind of talk about (3:26 - 3:30)
the whole thing from start to finish (3:28 - 3:32)
um and then a fifth Possible episode (3:30 - 3:34)
would be like (3:32 - 3:36)
the Elite Four or whatever whatever that (3:34 - 3:39)
end stuff is well we know there's an (3:36 - 3:42)
elite four right so they say they tell (3:39 - 3:43)
you yeah yeah they tell you multiple (3:42 - 3:44)
times (3:43 - 3:46)
um that way you know kind of exactly (3:44 - 3:48)
what going in and you know I think it's (3:46 - 3:49)
kind of like (3:48 - 3:52)
the the end of a movie right like you (3:49 - 3:54)
finish that storyline and you want to (3:52 - 3:56)
talk about it and now you have you'll (3:54 - 3:58)
have a podcast episode that'll you know (3:56 - 4:00)
let's talk about it (3:58 - 4:02)
uh so that's that's the plan going in (4:00 - 4:04)
obviously they'll be they'll be named (4:02 - 4:06)
and labeled and you know whether you (4:04 - 4:07)
finish this game in two days or whether (4:06 - 4:10)
you finish this game in a month they'll (4:07 - 4:13)
they'll exist on the internet so you (4:10 - 4:14)
know (4:13 - 4:15)
and I'm like really I'm really excited (4:14 - 4:17)
to do those episodes (4:15 - 4:19)
um which makes today's episode hard (4:17 - 4:20)
because we're not going to talk about (4:19 - 4:22)
that kind of stuff we are not (4:20 - 4:24)
nope nope (4:22 - 4:27)
we have other things to talk about (4:24 - 4:30)
apparently uh there there is a little (4:27 - 4:32)
bit of Pokemon news that we will kick (4:30 - 4:35)
off with and just kind of get through (4:32 - 4:39)
um the first bit is uh you know (4:35 - 4:41)
if there's one thing consistent about (4:39 - 4:44)
the Pokemon company is they like to dump (4:41 - 4:47)
everything the same week (4:44 - 4:51)
and out of nowhere the Pokemon Trading (4:47 - 4:54)
Card Game Live is now in beta for (4:51 - 4:57)
everyone download it when you want ah (4:54 - 4:58)
this came out I believe on like (4:57 - 5:00)
Wednesday I think (4:58 - 5:02)
uh you can go in the iOS store or the (5:00 - 5:05)
Android Store and download it and they (5:02 - 5:09)
did say when the Pokemon Trading Card (5:05 - 5:12)
Game Live officially releases Pokemon (5:09 - 5:15)
Trading Card Game Online which has (5:12 - 5:17)
existed for the last 120 years that's (5:15 - 5:20)
why it looks like it was made in 1999 uh (5:17 - 5:23)
that will shut down (5:20 - 5:26)
I have a feeling that this app is going (5:23 - 5:29)
to be in beta yeah maybe longer than (5:26 - 5:32)
Gmail has been in beta (5:29 - 5:32)
uh well we can hope it's gonna be in (5:33 - 5:37)
beta because I've not heard (5:35 - 5:41)
I've not heard a lot of positives (5:37 - 5:44)
no I'm not a TCG player of the Pokemon (5:41 - 5:49)
kind and even I've heard (5:44 - 5:49)
exciting things was coming to Minnesota (5:51 - 5:56)
and trying to convince you know Greg's (5:53 - 5:58)
goal was to convince me to play Magic my (5:56 - 6:00)
goal is to convince Greg to get into the (5:58 - 6:03)
Pokemon train card game (6:00 - 6:06)
uh that hasn't happened yet and you know (6:03 - 6:08)
I (6:06 - 6:12)
ptcg live uh isn't (6:08 - 6:15)
I I don't know I I I can't say that I've (6:12 - 6:17)
I've played it since you know I (6:15 - 6:19)
originally got that (6:17 - 6:21)
um demo from Nintendo where they they (6:19 - 6:23)
invited invited I think it was like me (6:21 - 6:24)
Marilyn there was a couple other people (6:23 - 6:26)
in that demo and they showed us why I (6:24 - 6:28)
walked through everything and the only (6:26 - 6:29)
thing I could think of watching the (6:28 - 6:31)
entire thing was like well you cut this (6:29 - 6:32)
feature you cut this feature you cut (6:31 - 6:35)
this feature like why is this gone (6:32 - 6:37)
um it just seemed very (6:35 - 6:40)
I it if how I don't know how something (6:37 - 6:42)
could feel so lightweight but so bloated (6:40 - 6:44)
at the same time (6:42 - 6:47)
um and I do play it on or what did you (6:44 - 6:49)
see it on like how did you see it it was (6:47 - 6:51)
like the the like the the desktop (6:49 - 6:56)
version or whatever oh okay yeah yeah (6:51 - 6:59)
um don't get me wrong I think uh I think (6:56 - 7:00)
having (6:59 - 7:05)
the trading card game on iOS is huge uh (7:00 - 7:09)
now I know that PTC Geo was on iPad but (7:05 - 7:12)
you can't put the iPad in your well (7:09 - 7:13)
maybe if you have jinko jeans you could (7:12 - 7:16)
put the iPad I've seen people on (7:13 - 7:19)
community today my full iPads out of a (7:16 - 7:21)
pocket this is small there's a little (7:19 - 7:23)
mini it's not yeah (7:21 - 7:26)
like I have seen wild things with the (7:23 - 7:28)
people iPad I'm like where did you pull (7:26 - 7:31)
that from but we all agree like being on (7:28 - 7:32)
a phone is significantly more important (7:31 - 7:34)
than just you know quote-unquote iPad (7:32 - 7:36)
and yes you can side load it on Android (7:34 - 7:38)
phones but (7:36 - 7:40)
um yeah not the same as just being (7:38 - 7:42)
available the power of being in an app (7:40 - 7:44)
store and hitting free download is is is (7:42 - 7:48)
out there yes (7:44 - 7:48)
uh yeah I mean it I why is it released (7:48 - 7:54)
this week why was it not released last (7:53 - 7:56)
week like Sableye in unite where (7:54 - 7:57)
everyone was like I don't want to start (7:56 - 8:00)
anything new or like I'm just kind of (7:57 - 8:02)
waiting like well I mean they didn't (8:00 - 8:04)

you'd like so just we're just gonna get (8:12 - 8:18)
the bandages all ripped off at the same (8:15 - 8:19)

that you know you only get a game for a (8:36 - 8:38)
birthday you only get a game for (8:37 - 8:40)

like give me the Pokemon game for this (8:45 - 8:49)
this is at least like look it's free (8:47 - 8:52)
it's free it's free but when you if you (8:49 - 8:54)
move your data to it you do not get to (8:52 - 8:58)
go back to uh the old the online version (8:54 - 9:01)
yeah it is a one-way Street yes (8:58 - 9:06)
yeah so but hey if I could understand if (9:01 - 9:09)
uh you're younger maybe can't afford (9:06 - 9:12)
scarlet and violet or or whatnot and (9:09 - 9:15)
you're stuck at your in-laws or your (9:12 - 9:18)
your grandma's this weekend and (9:15 - 9:19)
everyone's playing scarlet and violet (9:18 - 9:21)
and you're like I need something to (9:19 - 9:23)
distract myself because everyone's (9:21 - 9:24)
passed out from Turkey (9:23 - 9:28)
uh yeah you got something to download (9:24 - 9:31)
helps that it gives people who aren't (9:28 - 9:34)
maybe interested in (9:31 - 9:36)
scarlet and violet something to talk (9:34 - 9:37)
about Well everybody's talking about (9:36 - 9:41)
Pokemon yeah true yeah (9:37 - 9:43)
thank goodness Niantic didn't do (9:41 - 9:45)
anything this past week I mean besides (9:43 - 9:46)
Singapore (9:45 - 9:48)
um I guess they did have like a mini (9:46 - 9:50)
walking thing (9:48 - 9:53)
to represent Singapore where it was like (9:50 - 9:55)
seven kilometers yeah five kilometers (9:53 - 9:58)
and it was a bunch of uh purloin because (9:55 - 10:01)
that was the that became the new shiny (9:58 - 10:03)
in-game (10:01 - 10:05)
um but (10:03 - 10:08)
uh as of recording this at one in the (10:05 - 10:10)
morning central time uh there is an uh (10:08 - 10:14)
Ultra Beast arrival countdown it says (10:10 - 10:16)
seven hours 26 minutes left uh on (10:14 - 10:22)
Pokemon go dot Pokemon go live.com so I (10:16 - 10:24)
don't know I struggled with that so (10:22 - 10:27)
Niantic didn't do anything week of (10:24 - 10:29)
scarlet and violet weekend thank (10:27 - 10:31)
goodness because sword and shield was uh (10:29 - 10:35)
gym chart Community Day I think yes (10:31 - 10:37)
and then I think let's go had something (10:35 - 10:39)
too didn't they that we can't let's go (10:37 - 10:42)
yeah I think it has an iron fist over (10:39 - 10:45)
scheduling and will not let anybody give (10:42 - 10:49)
criticisms about overlapping anything (10:45 - 10:51)
uh I do want to give niant a credit here (10:49 - 10:56)
because we we very rarely do the (10:51 - 10:59)
Ultra Beast commercials they have been (10:56 - 11:01)
running have been absolutely fantastic (10:59 - 11:05)
yeah if you like seeing people die hello (11:01 - 11:08)
yeah they have been they've been very (11:05 - 11:10)
very they have been very much full of (11:08 - 11:12)
these people have not survived this (11:10 - 11:15)
experience (11:12 - 11:15)
I'm into it don't get me wrong this is (11:15 - 11:22)
the this is the content I'm looking for (11:17 - 11:22)
um (11:23 - 11:27)
what we're missing some Ultra Beast so (11:24 - 11:28)
uh I mean in the trailer I'm seeing (11:27 - 11:30)
nyligo I'm seeing Cortana I'm seeing (11:28 - 11:34)
buzzwall I'm seeing uh celestila (11:30 - 11:36)

both cephalon we're missing stock ataka (11:36 - 11:40)
we're missing (11:38 - 11:43)
one other one I think (11:40 - 11:46)
yes (11:43 - 11:46)
necrozma you could write or the (11:50 - 11:56)
Christmas not an ultra bees let's get (11:53 - 11:56)
geez Bobby right right I'm trying I'm (11:56 - 12:00)
just trying to think of like anything (11:59 - 12:03)
else that might be (12:00 - 12:03)
um (12:04 - 12:07)
yeah I (12:05 - 12:11)
I I are they flipping cart not is it (12:07 - 12:14)
Cortana celestila yeah southern (12:11 - 12:16)
hemisphere right now (12:14 - 12:18)
southern hemisphere are they turning (12:16 - 12:20)
these shiny finally I feel like it's too (12:18 - 12:23)
soon to turn that's too soon it's only (12:20 - 12:25)
been a couple months yeah yeah they (12:23 - 12:27)
gotta they gotta drag that out for a (12:25 - 12:31)
while 2024 for shiny Ultra beasts yeah (12:27 - 12:34)
yeah so I I I don't I don't I don't know (12:31 - 12:36)
like what's in raids right now Bobby (12:34 - 12:40)
nothing good because Lords and raids for (12:36 - 12:42)
the tier five stuff and then I think (12:40 - 12:44)
it's Gyarados for Mega raids right now (12:42 - 12:48)
so okay I mean Gyarados is a good Mega (12:44 - 12:49)
but yeah still guzzler it's been (12:48 - 12:52)
guzzlord for a couple weeks now (12:49 - 12:54)
for a while that's why it's like man (12:52 - 12:57)
I mean like I kind of liked that it's (12:54 - 12:59)
been guzzler because I haven't really I (12:57 - 13:01)
mean it's been cold in Minneapolis (12:59 - 13:04)
uh you know these games have been coming (13:01 - 13:07)
out so it's it's nice when the thing in (13:04 - 13:09)
Pogo isn't like you've already done it (13:07 - 13:12)
all you're like caught up almost yeah I (13:09 - 13:14)
think I mean I don't I mean I know that (13:12 - 13:16)
they've not done this before but it kind (13:14 - 13:18)
of seems planned out that way I mean (13:16 - 13:21)
I feel like a lot of people who don't (13:18 - 13:24)
just play Pokemon go have maybe put it (13:21 - 13:26)
aside for the last few days if they're (13:24 - 13:28)
also playing Pokemon Scarlet Violet so (13:26 - 13:30)
um it's nice I mean I I honestly like I (13:28 - 13:32)
didn't play yesterday like I forgot to (13:30 - 13:35)
play Pokemon go yesterday and a couple (13:32 - 13:37)
days ago and I came back to it and was (13:35 - 13:39)
like oh there was events that like ended (13:37 - 13:42)
at some point in the last few days and (13:39 - 13:44)
it's like oh that's fine I guess there (13:42 - 13:47)
are those events that ended and uh while (13:44 - 13:48)
scarlet and violet has a frame rate (13:47 - 13:51)
problem Niantic was like here is as many (13:48 - 13:54)
frames as possible do you want your do (13:51 - 13:56)
you do you want your game to feel so (13:54 - 13:59)
fast you think your your mind is melting (13:56 - 14:04)
because whatever magic they did there (13:59 - 14:08)
what happened how has Pokemon go so fast (14:04 - 14:11)
I don't know like like it's almost too (14:08 - 14:13)
optimization yeah like I open the menu (14:11 - 14:15)
and I'm like did I press the right (14:13 - 14:18)
button they stole the code (14:15 - 14:23)
from scarlet and violet it was a place (14:18 - 14:23)
right fast fast frames they're like give (14:27 - 14:33)
me that code copy paste except they hit (14:30 - 14:36)
copy they hit cut cut (14:33 - 14:36)
if you want to hire us for animation or (14:38 - 14:45)
speed we could do it let's do it we can (14:41 - 14:47)
push the update right now we've been (14:45 - 14:50)
sitting on it for this moment (14:47 - 14:53)
um it I I it's great uh also there are (14:50 - 14:56)
new Scarlet and violet avatars (14:53 - 14:58)
completely free in the store (14:56 - 15:01)
um if you because you can't change your (14:58 - 15:03)
clothes really in Scarlet Violet feel (15:01 - 15:07)
free to match that here in this game (15:03 - 15:07)
um and then finally uh another good how (15:07 - 15:12)
are we so positive on Pokemon go this (15:10 - 15:15)
week it's crazy another great thing is (15:12 - 15:18)

the update to go uh (16:15 - 16:23)
good on them hey bomb into that I'm not (16:19 - 16:26)

a it won't be and we're not even how (16:39 - 16:45)
dare you Rosalia (16:42 - 16:48)
in my heart right now Rosalia with a (16:45 - 16:49)
snowball I'm glad you said it because I (16:48 - 16:51)
was thinking (16:49 - 16:55)
how dare you you won't believe what (16:51 - 16:57)
Greg's new favorite is on our miniseries (16:55 - 16:59)
coming later this week (16:57 - 17:03)
I have to pick one jeez (16:59 - 17:03)
um the Pokemon company sent me the (17:04 - 17:09)
squishmallow and that should be (17:08 - 17:11)
launching later this week exclusively on (17:09 - 17:14)
pokemoncenter.com I heard Tuesday don't (17:11 - 17:16)
know what time there will be two (17:14 - 17:18)
squishmallows one is a Pikachu and one (17:16 - 17:22)
is a Gengar I am still campaigning that (17:18 - 17:24)
Gengar gets more merch and more special (17:22 - 17:25)
treatment than a lot of other Pokemon (17:24 - 17:28)
just you know campaigning that out there (17:25 - 17:32)
um I how much is a squish mellow (17:28 - 17:32)
I would imagine yeah okay uh uh I we (17:32 - 17:39)
have one but I have no idea what it (17:37 - 17:40)
costs because if it's not there when (17:39 - 17:43)
when it is purchased (17:40 - 17:47)
if only we had the internet I I will say (17:43 - 17:49)
it is incredibly nice quality it is very (17:47 - 17:52)
squishable very soft uh if if they did (17:49 - 17:55)
not send it to me for free just being (17:52 - 17:57)
transparent I would have probably bought (17:55 - 17:58)
this (17:57 - 18:02)
uh and uh Lamont the black and white (17:58 - 18:05)
pride French bulldog with rainbow ears (18:02 - 18:07)
and sunglasses with a white belly is (18:05 - 18:11)
currently on their website for 19.99. (18:07 - 18:12)
that cheap (18:11 - 18:15)
third month tax though for Pokemon (18:12 - 18:19)
Pokemon tax is gonna be but yeah (18:15 - 18:22)
uh I don't collect squishmallows I know (18:19 - 18:26)
that there are very popular (18:22 - 18:29)
um so I would suspect that these would (18:26 - 18:31)
sell out right I mean if a hundred (18:29 - 18:33)
dollar Puma shoes are selling out in two (18:31 - 18:36)
to three hours on pokemoncenter.com oh (18:33 - 18:38)
yeah these will sell out (18:36 - 18:41)
so if you're listening if you're into (18:38 - 18:43)
this I was told Tuesday I was not told (18:41 - 18:45)
the time I don't know uh command R (18:43 - 18:47)
refresh your browsers (18:45 - 18:49)
um that's that's a Mac thing I don't (18:47 - 18:51)

on (18:51 - 18:54)
[Music] (18:55 - 18:58)
yeah they were super they were hyped up (19:00 - 19:06)
a lot was it uh was it twitchcon or (19:02 - 19:08)
was it Comic-Con maybe they're like I (19:06 - 19:10)
showed them off at one point and people (19:08 - 19:11)
think they were in the world or (19:10 - 19:12)
something I don't know (19:11 - 19:15)
man everybody was like (19:12 - 19:17)
I want that now so I imagine it's (19:15 - 19:19)
they're gonna go (19:17 - 19:22)
fairly quickly (19:19 - 19:22)
um yeah I I I would uh I would imagine (19:23 - 19:29)
so as well (19:26 - 19:31)
uh and I think I think that's all all (19:29 - 19:34)
the news I mean they're just in unite (19:31 - 19:36)
there was um just Sable I write nothing (19:34 - 19:38)
nothing yeah (19:36 - 19:41)
should go to coins and a couple of they (19:38 - 19:45)
are having a Scarlet violet (19:41 - 19:46)
event sort of (19:45 - 19:48)
where you could get the outfit right you (19:46 - 19:51)
can get the outfit (19:48 - 19:53)
and so the and stickers I think (19:51 - 19:58)
the outfit for who for yourself in yeah (19:53 - 20:00)
so in unite you can look like the (19:58 - 20:02)
characters from scarlet and violet okay (20:00 - 20:06)
okay I was like for the Pokemon or I (20:02 - 20:08)
mean honestly at this point yeah why not (20:06 - 20:10)
yeah why not (20:08 - 20:13)
uh yeah unite has the main character (20:10 - 20:15)
outfits (20:13 - 20:18)
uh a frame a background and some (20:15 - 20:20)
stickers I believe I think that's (20:18 - 20:22)
everything (20:20 - 20:23)
got it (20:22 - 20:26)
says uh if you own Scarlet Violet from (20:23 - 20:28)
December 1st you'll be long tonight (20:26 - 20:30)
where you can get the main outfit (20:28 - 20:33)
and then I think that's running for I (20:30 - 20:35)
think it's writing till next year it's (20:33 - 20:37)
running for a long time yeah I think you (20:35 - 20:38)
have like the rest of the year to do it (20:37 - 20:40)
yeah but you just have to have scarlet (20:38 - 20:41)
and violet (20:40 - 20:45)
Violet to get these and Unite (20:41 - 20:45)
um and then (20:47 - 20:51)
I I actually I'm not gonna lie I haven't (20:49 - 20:53)
logged into Pokemon Masters in two weeks (20:51 - 20:54)
I have no clue what's happening I think (20:53 - 20:56)
Hugh is in that game right now Hugh and (20:54 - 20:58)
buffelant (20:56 - 21:01)
um so that's cool Cigna suit n is in (20:58 - 21:04)
there right now what which end is this (21:01 - 21:07)
number 12. no this is the second (21:04 - 21:09)
I think it's only the second end (21:07 - 21:11)
I think there's only two ends there's (21:09 - 21:13)
characters that you really like in that (21:11 - 21:15)
game if your name is Erica if your name (21:13 - 21:17)
is Erica 17 versions yeah there's a ton (21:15 - 21:20)
of you uh there's a there's a bunch of (21:17 - 21:21)
marnies (21:20 - 21:25)
yeah but Martin is pretty great (21:21 - 21:27)
in fact everybody likes how how is Milo (21:25 - 21:29)
not how is Milo not in there how is (21:27 - 21:31)
mirror being out in this game yet for (21:29 - 21:33)
crying out loud (21:31 - 21:35)
um Masters is going pretty good I mean (21:33 - 21:38)
it's pretty standard they are right now (21:35 - 21:42)
doing a login and get a bunch of bonuses (21:38 - 21:45)
for scarlet and violet oh oh yeah if you (21:42 - 21:47)
log in for the next four days you get (21:45 - 21:49)
gems and then you get to see characters (21:47 - 21:51)
talking about we've heard about this new (21:49 - 21:53)
region there's new Pokemon (21:51 - 21:57)
stuff I want to see all about it I do (21:53 - 21:59)
too (21:57 - 22:02)
you don't like that stuff that's cute I (21:59 - 22:04)
mean Erica Erica talking about how she (22:02 - 22:08)
wants Erica this (22:04 - 22:10)
standard Erica talking about how she (22:08 - 22:12)
wants to nuzzle into sprigatito and let (22:10 - 22:16)
its calming sense lull her to sleep it's (22:12 - 22:19)
cute conversation (22:16 - 22:19)
I feel like Masters is constantly giving (22:19 - 22:24)
things away like I don't play master (22:22 - 22:26)
that I try every once in a while and (22:24 - 22:27)
then it's always when you guys are (22:26 - 22:29)
talking about something else they're (22:27 - 22:30)
giving away it feels like that happens (22:29 - 22:34)
fairly often they are much better at (22:30 - 22:36)
giving (22:34 - 22:40)
gems away so that you can you can pull (22:36 - 22:41)
because it's now basically a collecting (22:40 - 22:44)
game so really you can pull about every (22:41 - 22:45)
two and a half weeks if you're just (22:44 - 22:47)
getting free stuff (22:45 - 22:49)
um if you try to do the other stuff you (22:47 - 22:50)
can get it through quicker but yeah they (22:49 - 22:53)
they are they are collecting game (22:50 - 22:55)
with some (22:53 - 22:57)
Hardcore gameplay if you really want to (22:55 - 22:58)
hunt it (22:57 - 23:00)
no I mean the people who like the (22:58 - 23:02)
Masters awesome they love it they love (23:00 - 23:05)
it uh it is fine it is yeah it's fine I (23:02 - 23:07)
think it's fine too I mean like I there (23:05 - 23:10)
there was a point where I felt like I (23:07 - 23:13)
had a lot of good sink Pairs and I I was (23:10 - 23:14)
at the level cap at the time I'm nowhere (23:13 - 23:17)
near level cap they keep raising it (23:14 - 23:19)
um and they introduced I think it was (23:17 - 23:20)
like they were it was like maybe the (23:19 - 23:23)
start of the tapus and I I felt really (23:20 - 23:24)
good like beating it and then I was able (23:23 - 23:26)
to do the harder difficulty and then I (23:24 - 23:27)
was even able to do the harder (23:26 - 23:28)
difficulty and during that time I was (23:27 - 23:30)
like doing my sync grid and I was like (23:28 - 23:32)
really into it for like two weeks and (23:30 - 23:34)
then they raised everything again and I (23:32 - 23:37)
was like you kind of like I like masters (23:34 - 23:39)
of (23:37 - 23:41)
um I got five minutes because I'm I'm (23:39 - 23:44)
I'm waiting for my food at you know in (23:41 - 23:46)
in the McDonald's to bring out my order (23:44 - 23:49)
or I'm at the dentist or something and (23:46 - 23:51)
or right before bed or right when I wake (23:49 - 23:54)
up but when I was doing those like I I (23:51 - 23:55)
spent like an hour in the game which is (23:54 - 23:57)
a long session for a mobile game just to (23:55 - 23:59)
sit there but I had a good time and then (23:57 - 24:02)
it's like knowing I had to do that and (23:59 - 24:03)
then another event comes through it's (24:02 - 24:05)
just like I don't have this hour right (24:03 - 24:07)
now to like look at a sink grid to like (24:05 - 24:09)
upgrade these characters to like (24:07 - 24:12)
maybe read online what other people (24:09 - 24:14)
might be doing like oh bring bring Misty (24:12 - 24:17)
and bring you know Leon and (24:14 - 24:19)
but the people who are into it are (24:17 - 24:21)
they're into yeah that's cool I always (24:19 - 24:23)
say the good thing about Masters is you (24:21 - 24:24)
can get a lot out of the game without (24:23 - 24:27)
having to do the hardcore stuff yeah and (24:24 - 24:31)
a lot of the event completions that give (24:27 - 24:34)
you gems don't require you to do the (24:31 - 24:36)
hardcore stuff like there'll be 11 (24:34 - 24:38)
different (24:36 - 24:42)
goals to hit and generally to get the (24:38 - 24:44)
gems you only have to hit 10 of them (24:42 - 24:47)
uh but you can do the harder stuff which (24:44 - 24:50)
does which will give you great rewards I (24:47 - 24:51)
think the interesting thing about (24:50 - 24:53)
Masters is they have a good balance of (24:51 - 24:55)
you if you want to play that game (24:53 - 24:57)
casually like I do you can still have a (24:55 - 25:00)
good time right like I pop in I date (24:57 - 25:03)
Professor Sycamore for a little bit we (25:00 - 25:06)
go out for tea I Auto Battle some stuff (25:03 - 25:08)
I do a little bit of the heart slightly (25:06 - 25:09)
hard stuff I'm like okay we're good (25:08 - 25:12)
we're out I'm out I'll see you tomorrow (25:09 - 25:13)
yeah (25:12 - 25:16)
uh important question is far-fetched in (25:13 - 25:20)
Masters yep he was in eggs yeah yeah (25:16 - 25:22)
nice and I think the shiny one was too (25:20 - 25:24)
yeah the Chinese in there I just got a (25:22 - 25:25)
shiny (25:24 - 25:28)
I got a shiny pincer today (25:25 - 25:28)
um (25:28 - 25:31)
accepted that eggs is just collecting (25:28 - 25:33)
eggs well eggs are good for free to play (25:31 - 25:35)
players too like if yeah if you can't (25:33 - 25:37)
pull gems like that's where the egg is (25:35 - 25:39)
going to come into (25:37 - 25:41)
um yeah B has surf etched and then you (25:39 - 25:42)
can (25:41 - 25:44)
hatch when it comes back around again (25:42 - 25:46)
farfetched yeah (25:44 - 25:49)
got it okay well (25:46 - 25:51)
probably won't pick it up again but who (25:49 - 25:54)
knows who knows yeah no it's it's it's (25:51 - 25:56)
there I mean it and it's one of those (25:54 - 25:57)
games that you can you can really drop (25:56 - 25:58)
it and come back like three months later (25:57 - 26:01)
oh yeah and they're so happy when you (25:58 - 26:04)
come back too yeah I think there's (26:01 - 26:05)
something built in the game where if it (26:04 - 26:07)
knows you haven't logged in for 60 days (26:05 - 26:10)
it like just douses you and stuff (26:07 - 26:12)
um which is smart oh yeah very smart (26:10 - 26:15)
that is smart uh speaking of dousing you (26:12 - 26:16)
and stuff we're gonna douse you with a (26:15 - 26:18)
break and when we come back we're gonna (26:16 - 26:20)
talk about some uh come that was like (26:18 - 26:22)
that was like a seven out of ten that (26:20 - 26:23)
was maybe an eight out of ten honestly (26:22 - 26:26)
uh we'll be we'll be we'll give it a 7 (26:23 - 26:28)
out of 10 because you hate sevens that's (26:26 - 26:31)
yeah that is that is the worthy number (26:28 - 26:34)
for that world of no sevens we will be (26:31 - 26:35)
right back we're gonna talk about some (26:34 - 26:38)
Scarlet Violet stuff again just (26:35 - 26:40)
mechanics things that you know should be (26:38 - 26:42)
important whether you know you're 10 (26:40 - 26:44)
hours into the game or 40 hours in the (26:42 - 26:46)
game you know stuff like (26:44 - 26:50)
you're not able to change your pants so (26:46 - 26:53)
nope uh we will be right back (26:50 - 26:57)
and we are back from our break all right (26:53 - 26:59)
oh boy where are we gonna start we're (26:57 - 27:00)
I'm giving myself 30 minutes here (26:59 - 27:03)
because uh I want these episodes to be (27:00 - 27:04)
an hour we're getting some more episodes (27:03 - 27:08)
later this week it's late at night gotta (27:04 - 27:11)
edit obviously we got hammer it out a (27:08 - 27:13)
lot of years probably with this game so (27:11 - 27:15)
we got time we got time to talk camera (27:13 - 27:16)
it out (27:15 - 27:17)
um (27:16 - 27:19)
we'll do the sandwich method I want to (27:17 - 27:22)
talk about something positive uh the (27:19 - 27:23)
character customization we talk about (27:22 - 27:25)
this on the first impressions like the (27:23 - 27:28)
the face the the hair okay (27:25 - 27:31)
I spent a good chunk of time figuring (27:28 - 27:33)
out how I would look to make myself look (27:31 - 27:35)
like myself without sort of (27:33 - 27:36)
contemplating the fact that it would be (27:35 - 27:41)
my face on a child's shaped body and it (27:36 - 27:44)
looks really weird and I do not like it (27:41 - 27:46)
but I'm stuck with it now you can change (27:44 - 27:49)
it anytime which is another Plus (27:46 - 27:52)
you can you can well a little weird hear (27:49 - 27:57)
what I said I am stuck with it (27:52 - 28:00)
and I cannot go back (27:57 - 28:03)
um uh (28:00 - 28:03)
it's it's great that we have taken baby (28:04 - 28:09)
steps here and you can have any (28:07 - 28:12)
hairstyle you want girl hair boy hair (28:09 - 28:14)
non-binary hair whatever however you (28:12 - 28:18)
want to classify that a lot of colors a (28:14 - 28:21)
lot of eyes a lot of facial features (28:18 - 28:22)
really I think probably the two things (28:21 - 28:26)
that are missing would probably be bald (28:22 - 28:28)
and facial hair (28:26 - 28:30)
bald well yeah because you're a kid I (28:28 - 28:32)
mean I did you know some kids around (28:30 - 28:33)
that time that didn't have facial hair (28:32 - 28:34)
so (28:33 - 28:37)
um also it is (28:34 - 28:41)
a little weird that they took away the (28:37 - 28:44)
much darker black skin tone because (28:41 - 28:47)
they're all pretty they're all pretty (28:44 - 28:50)
light skin tones in this one (28:47 - 28:52)
um yeah I thought they added another one (28:50 - 28:55)
nope (28:52 - 28:57)
there was more skin tones (28:55 - 28:59)
they're eight I think they're still (28:57 - 29:02)
eight right there where they're not uh (28:59 - 29:05)
they're well there are four they're I (29:02 - 29:06)
mean they're the same they're four and (29:05 - 29:08)
four male and female I know it was no (29:06 - 29:09)
extra you could do a little bit more (29:08 - 29:12)
detail on skin tone after picking one of (29:09 - 29:15)
the eight yeah no (29:12 - 29:17)
there was never that so it's a bit of a (29:15 - 29:19)
bummer that sort of and I've seen it (29:17 - 29:21)
I've seen it around people are like this (29:19 - 29:23)
is the darkest my skin tone can go it's (29:21 - 29:25)
like yeah it's not it's not great (29:23 - 29:27)
because because it was it has been (29:25 - 29:30)
darker in other previous I think in Sun (29:27 - 29:33)
and Moon it was pretty dark yeah um yeah (29:30 - 29:35)
so they didn't make out they made a (29:33 - 29:37)
choice there but they did expand a lot (29:35 - 29:39)
of the (29:37 - 29:41)
um (29:39 - 29:44)
customization like there's a lot of eye (29:41 - 29:46)
colors there's a lot of hairstyles (29:44 - 29:49)
there's a lot of new hair colors (29:46 - 29:49)
uh it's really really great it's so (30:00 - 30:06)
great that like right off the bat I was (30:03 - 30:08)
like man this is this is this is awesome (30:06 - 30:11)
and one weird thing uh you you can (30:08 - 30:14)
change your face and eyes and hairs like (30:11 - 30:16)
you sorry not hair you can change all of (30:14 - 30:18)
that at any point in the game you can (30:16 - 30:20)
hit the d-pad and change it just (30:18 - 30:22)
anywhere if you want to just change your (30:20 - 30:23)
eyes from (30:22 - 30:26)
great to White you can do that you just (30:23 - 30:29)
the hair you have to go to a salon and (30:26 - 30:32)
pay which is like fine it's it's just (30:29 - 30:35)
weird that like everything is here (30:32 - 30:38)
anywhere and this one thing is here in (30:35 - 30:41)
like a couple cities (30:38 - 30:42)
um I just and they you know that was (30:41 - 30:44)
something Nintendo told me when I did (30:42 - 30:45)
the preview they were like hey you can (30:44 - 30:46)
change it anywhere except for your hair (30:45 - 30:50)
over here I was like okay okay (30:46 - 30:50)
you know not a complaint just you know (30:52 - 30:55)
weird (30:54 - 30:57)
um and then (30:55 - 31:00)
there was I don't know I don't know (30:57 - 31:03)
somebody's wrong uh I I I forgot to ask (31:00 - 31:06)
about clothes in my preview and then I (31:03 - 31:09)
heard that IGN or another game Outlet (31:06 - 31:11)
asks about clothes and I I was told or I (31:09 - 31:14)
heard so I apologize because that's what (31:11 - 31:15)
I heard (31:14 - 31:17)
um that there would be like hoodies and (31:15 - 31:20)
shirts and different pants but you start (31:17 - 31:22)
with four different school outfits (31:20 - 31:25)
there there are no hoodies and bad (31:22 - 31:29)
shirts it or really pants you you can (31:25 - 31:31)
you can change you can buy as many (31:29 - 31:34)
gloves as you want hats boots socks (31:31 - 31:38)
socks uh backpacks backpacks that's it (31:34 - 31:42)
four oh glasses four onesies ultimately (31:38 - 31:47)
of spring summer winter fall fall (31:42 - 31:49)
and nothing else which which if if (31:47 - 31:52)
you're running the winter outfit which I (31:49 - 31:54)
think looks good yeah (31:52 - 31:57)
socks are off the table yep because you (31:54 - 31:59)
have long pants you can't see any of the (31:57 - 32:02)
500 socks they've designed (31:59 - 32:05)
uh and that's it and if you don't if you (32:02 - 32:08)
if you want your hair like me I don't I (32:05 - 32:10)
don't wear hats in real life (32:08 - 32:12)
yeah so all the hats are off the table (32:10 - 32:15)
Yeah I personally not a fan of gloves on (32:12 - 32:16)
my character (32:15 - 32:18)
I'm wearing gloves this time because (32:16 - 32:21)
it's like the lights (32:18 - 32:24)
what else are you gonna do like (32:21 - 32:27)
so I will freely admit that I was saving (32:24 - 32:30)
up money thinking well I need it for (32:27 - 32:32)
clothes (32:30 - 32:35)
and then I got to another big city and (32:32 - 32:36)
I'm like okay (32:35 - 32:38)
wait a minute (32:36 - 32:42)
none of these shops sell me pants (32:38 - 32:45)
wait no no nothing none of them sell me (32:42 - 32:48)
paint none of them Bobby is dumbfounded (32:45 - 32:50)
he is he is shocked right like I haven't (32:48 - 32:51)
because I haven't tried I haven't tried (32:50 - 32:54)
to do this yet but like I could didn't (32:51 - 32:56)
we just talk about the other day how you (32:54 - 32:57)
wasted all your money buying clothes (32:56 - 33:00)
Steve or something so what did you ask (32:57 - 33:03)
him yeah no no on Friday when we were (33:00 - 33:05)
talking about oh yeah because I only had (33:03 - 33:07)
eight thousand dollars and I bought a (33:05 - 33:08)
pair of eight thousand dollar boots it (33:07 - 33:10)
was that expensive for a parent that (33:08 - 33:12)
expensive or a pair of boots I see okay (33:10 - 33:14)
yeah wow yeah (33:12 - 33:16)
why is it's just the two steps four or (33:14 - 33:18)
the one step four two steps exactly yeah (33:16 - 33:20)
it's insane because (33:18 - 33:22)
sword and shield (33:20 - 33:22)
she every time I went into a store I was (33:23 - 33:27)
so excited and I feel like I'm (33:25 - 33:30)
downplaying this but like every time I (33:27 - 33:31)
went and I was a Cramer and shirt apple (33:30 - 33:34)
and shirt Pikachu shirt Evie shirt uh a (33:31 - 33:38)
Blazer non-blazer t-shirt leather jacket (33:34 - 33:42)
like so many different clothes and I the (33:38 - 33:44)
your character looks incredible in this (33:42 - 33:46)
game if there's one thing that looks (33:44 - 33:48)
great it is your character's face and (33:46 - 33:50)
you look at it a lot and it looks good (33:48 - 33:54)
and just to have the same one of four (33:50 - 33:58)
outfits yeah is is such a bummer yeah (33:54 - 34:02)
and I've I've I've this is one of the (33:58 - 34:05)
things I things I tell to Niantic is (34:02 - 34:06)
when they ask for feedback I'm like (34:05 - 34:09)
character customization is so important (34:06 - 34:11)
looking like you want to look in games (34:09 - 34:15)
really gives you this form of connection (34:11 - 34:18)
um yeah and and they always write it (34:15 - 34:19)
down they're always like yeah we know (34:18 - 34:21)
we're fixing character like whatever (34:19 - 34:22)
that's a whole different conversation (34:21 - 34:25)
but but I I even thought like okay (34:22 - 34:28)
you're in school I get it the theme is (34:25 - 34:29)
you're in school you got a school outfit (34:28 - 34:32)
I'm assuming you're going to be champion (34:29 - 34:33)
this is just an assumption right you're (34:32 - 34:36)
gonna bet you're gonna become champion (34:33 - 34:37)
at that point aren't you done with (34:36 - 34:40)
school you graduated as a champion I'm (34:37 - 34:41)
assuming didn't get there yet I haven't (34:40 - 34:43)
beat the game (34:41 - 34:45)
as a champion I should wear what I want (34:43 - 34:48)
right I'm done with school I did it so (34:45 - 34:50)
if Greg was like Hey I beat the game (34:48 - 34:52)
just to let you know that there's a sick (34:50 - 34:55)
cramerant hoodie after you you have to (34:52 - 34:56)
deal with the outfit until after post (34:55 - 34:58)
credits I'd be like fine perfect totally (34:56 - 35:00)
okay (34:59 - 35:03)
that's not it's just the school outfit (35:00 - 35:06)
it's just the school outfit which is (35:03 - 35:09)
it is mind blocking and this and here's (35:06 - 35:10)
the thing (35:09 - 35:12)
apart from everybody looking like robots (35:10 - 35:15)
the outfits that everybody is wearing (35:12 - 35:18)
outside of this I'm like I want that (35:15 - 35:21)
tank yeah I want that I want that jacket (35:18 - 35:24)
I want those pants and I can't get them (35:21 - 35:27)
they're in the game I can't buy them I (35:24 - 35:30)
can't put them on myself I am stuck in (35:27 - 35:31)
four (35:30 - 35:34)
awful school outfits that I'm whatever (35:31 - 35:36)
yeah that sounds good but here's the (35:34 - 35:38)
problem I go into a raid it was always (35:36 - 35:40)
exciting to see how people who are (35:38 - 35:42)
coming in random people are coming in I (35:40 - 35:43)
want to see what you're wearing honest (35:42 - 35:45)
with you what you what you like and we (35:43 - 35:47)
all look the same except some of us are (35:45 - 35:50)
wearing stupid hats (35:47 - 35:54)
but my I like most of them are bad (35:50 - 35:55)
um (35:54 - 35:59)
you're right the the outfits that other (35:55 - 36:02)
characters are wearing are so so good (35:59 - 36:05)
good and like of course they have (36:02 - 36:06)
customization because those Kit like (36:05 - 36:08)
when you saw like the Toro shirt on that (36:06 - 36:10)
kid in the previous trailer and stuff (36:08 - 36:13)
in real time shirt is great also I want (36:10 - 36:15)
it also just just a weird thing in the (36:13 - 36:17)
game again not this is not quite just (36:15 - 36:20)
weird uh you battle students throughout (36:17 - 36:23)
the whole world of paldea uh the some of (36:20 - 36:26)
them are old people with beards you're a (36:23 - 36:30)
student why where's my beard why can't I (36:26 - 36:34)
well okay so clearly this is in all ages (36:30 - 36:36)
University like they they cover a little (36:34 - 36:39)
because there are tiny toddlers who are (36:36 - 36:41)
also students and there are grandfathers (36:39 - 36:45)
and retirees who are also students so (36:41 - 36:49)
let me be an adult yeah yeah like I (36:45 - 36:51)
don't I don't need I'm stuck in this (36:49 - 36:52)
weird (36:51 - 36:55)
14 year old body with four outfits that (36:52 - 36:58)
you do not let me change again and I (36:55 - 37:01)
would be okay with the outfits if once (36:58 - 37:03)
you are a champion you can (37:01 - 37:05)
you concuss I would totally be okay or (37:03 - 37:09)
or maybe like tie the outfits to like uh (37:05 - 37:11)
you know once you graduate the classes (37:09 - 37:13)
which (37:11 - 37:15)
um good transition here uh there's (37:13 - 37:18)
there's like a side classes where you (37:15 - 37:22)
could take uh mathematics history (37:18 - 37:25)
um uh language I don't want to spend too (37:22 - 37:27)
much time on it and I will say it's not (37:25 - 37:30)
perfect but there's there's so much (37:27 - 37:32)
there was something I said like maybe (37:30 - 37:34)
two months ago of like the game doesn't (37:32 - 37:36)
tell you anything like how is a player (37:34 - 37:38)
supposed to know that (37:36 - 37:40)
um you know Tara does like three times (37:38 - 37:43)
the damage or critical hit happens this (37:40 - 37:47)
often and they they I don't they they (37:43 - 37:48)
listen to the two months they programmed (37:47 - 37:50)
it in no they but the school stuff does (37:48 - 37:53)
that it kind of acknowledges a lot of (37:50 - 37:55)
the behind the scenes of the game but in (37:53 - 37:58)
a really fun way yeah um like for (37:55 - 37:59)
example let's say you've never played a (37:58 - 38:01)
Pokemon game and you didn't know that if (37:59 - 38:03)
you bought exactly 10 premiere balls you (38:01 - 38:05)
you would get a sorry pokeballs you (38:03 - 38:07)
would get a free Premiere ball there's (38:05 - 38:09)
like a question that like tells you that (38:07 - 38:11)
which is like really cool (38:09 - 38:11)
um (38:11 - 38:15)
and they they the math part is kind of (38:11 - 38:16)
like the teaching you super effective (38:15 - 38:18)
but in a way more efficient way than (38:16 - 38:21)
just like writing on a uh like a (38:18 - 38:23)
Blackboard in like previous games like (38:21 - 38:25)
it's really it's really well done I (38:23 - 38:27)
don't think it's perfect but it's a huge (38:25 - 38:30)
step forward and like I don't know how (38:27 - 38:32)
they do it because like I feel like when (38:30 - 38:33)
you go to the school you're kind of (38:32 - 38:34)
stuck there and you're just in this Loop (38:33 - 38:36)
of taking quizzes and it's like it's (38:34 - 38:38)
fine it does I actually kind of feel (38:36 - 38:41)
like schoolwork honestly yeah but it but (38:38 - 38:43)
it is better than just walking into a (38:41 - 38:45)
thing looking at a Blackboard talking to (38:43 - 38:47)
an NPC that has a throwaway dialogue and (38:45 - 38:50)
then walking out I also like that as you (38:47 - 38:51)
do the classes do you unlock (38:50 - 38:54)
interactions with those teachers yes (38:51 - 38:57)
which actually makes the teachers feel (38:54 - 38:59)
like a bigger part of the world than any (38:57 - 39:02)
of the gym leaders do yes there's (38:59 - 39:03)
there's a there's again we can't we're (39:02 - 39:05)
not talking about specific stuff we'll (39:03 - 39:06)
save that for the mini series but (39:05 - 39:07)
there's a teacher that I didn't care (39:06 - 39:09)
about and a student came up and like (39:07 - 39:11)
said something and the teacher was like (39:09 - 39:13)
oh I don't talk about that right now and (39:11 - 39:14)
I was like that line of dialogue I (39:13 - 39:15)
didn't care about you at all teacher (39:14 - 39:18)
that line of dialogue I care I want to (39:15 - 39:19)
know now because you said you didn't (39:18 - 39:22)
want to talk about it and I I need I (39:19 - 39:24)
need I need the tea yeah I want to know (39:22 - 39:27)
what's going on but what's this industry (39:24 - 39:31)
so uh you know that's that's there (39:27 - 39:33)
um we talked about on our first (39:31 - 39:36)
impression that they they got rid of (39:33 - 39:37)
um (39:36 - 39:42)
that you cannot toggle the the moves the (39:37 - 39:43)
moves always stay on (39:42 - 39:46)
uh if you if you use flamethrower the (39:43 - 39:47)
battle animation (39:46 - 39:51)
lost words uh a weird thing right (39:47 - 39:54)
uh you know Legends Arceus you couldn't (39:51 - 39:55)
turn that off (39:54 - 39:57)
battles were weird in that game (39:55 - 39:59)
um compared to a traditional Pokemon (39:57 - 40:00)
game (39:59 - 40:02)
uh and then we talked about getting rid (40:00 - 40:04)
of set and shift which (40:02 - 40:08)
another weird choice (40:04 - 40:08)
uh they also got rid of pokirus not in (40:08 - 40:13)
the game (40:12 - 40:18)
just not there yep uh which (40:13 - 40:19)
you know if you're listening to this (40:18 - 40:21)
podcast you probably know what that is (40:19 - 40:25)
person out you know picking this up (40:21 - 40:27)
playing it finishing it going back to (40:25 - 40:29)
Fortnight probably don't care you know (40:27 - 40:31)
it was like a one in 24 000 chance of (40:29 - 40:33)
getting pokerists (40:31 - 40:35)
um (40:33 - 40:38)
honestly from what I've heard I haven't (40:35 - 40:40)
done it yet Evie training in this game (40:38 - 40:42)
is apparently way better than any past (40:40 - 40:43)
game (40:42 - 40:44)
so (40:43 - 40:46)
probably don't need it anyways yeah I (40:44 - 40:49)
mean as long as they as long as they (40:46 - 40:52)
have a better way to fill the Gap I'm (40:49 - 40:54)
fine with a with a one and whatever (40:52 - 40:56)
chance of getting it (40:54 - 40:59)
but it is weird (40:56 - 41:01)
it for me it was just like a fun thing (40:59 - 41:03)
to collect yeah it was like an exciting (41:01 - 41:05)
little surprise that you kind of look (41:03 - 41:07)
forward to it's it's not here you know (41:05 - 41:08)
it wasn't in let's go Pikachu let's go (41:07 - 41:10)
Evie wasn't in Legends (41:08 - 41:12)
it's not here (41:10 - 41:14)
um you know things like the catching (41:12 - 41:16)
charm the the (41:14 - 41:19)
uh was shiny charm is still there but (41:16 - 41:22)
the mark charm the well I can't remember (41:19 - 41:23)
the last one the experience charm or (41:22 - 41:25)
something yeah experience charm yeah (41:23 - 41:28)
those aren't in the game either but (41:25 - 41:30)
those were replaced with sandwich making (41:28 - 41:33)
yeah um which is the shiny hunting (41:30 - 41:35)
method in the game you can make a (41:33 - 41:37)
sandwich that will increase Shiny (41:35 - 41:38)
Pokemon you can make a sandwich that (41:37 - 41:41)
will increase titles which are the marks (41:38 - 41:43)
that appear yeah I think that's all (41:41 - 41:45)
really cool wait there's no shiny charm (41:43 - 41:47)
in the game there is a shiny charm but (41:45 - 41:49)
you want you want to make a shiny (41:47 - 41:54)
sandwich is the way okay okay yeah so (41:49 - 41:56)
you can you can you can do the you if (41:54 - 41:58)
you have both obviously that's the most (41:56 - 42:01)
efficient right right way to do it (41:58 - 42:03)
so they're making some bold choices and (42:01 - 42:04)
like (42:03 - 42:07)
cutting stuff but maybe cutting stuff (42:04 - 42:08)
that (42:07 - 42:11)
like the set and shift thing is still so (42:08 - 42:14)
weird I feel like so far with what like (42:11 - 42:16)
what we've just been talking about as (42:14 - 42:17)
far as the classes go (42:16 - 42:20)
as far as taking something like uh set (42:17 - 42:23)
or shift away and just having it be you (42:20 - 42:25)
know what it's going to be as well as (42:23 - 42:26)
like (42:25 - 42:28)
um and maybe I missed this in earlier (42:26 - 42:29)
games but I'm pretty sure it's new when (42:28 - 42:32)
you uh can learn a new move your Pokemon (42:29 - 42:35)
can learn a new move you can have it (42:32 - 42:37)
give you advice for what you can (42:35 - 42:38)
basically have it tell you which move or (42:37 - 42:40)
if it should learn the move at all right (42:38 - 42:43)
now or not which that wasn't in earlier (42:40 - 42:44)
games right this is Brandon that's brand (42:43 - 42:47)
new okay I feel like a lot of those (42:44 - 42:48)
things are geared toward (42:47 - 42:50)
it's like hey maybe you've never played (42:48 - 42:52)
this before it's like geared toward new (42:50 - 42:54)
people coming into playing the game I (42:52 - 42:56)
feel like more than the games have done (42:54 - 42:57)
in the past (42:56 - 42:59)
and I don't know if (42:57 - 43:02)
it's a good thing or not or whatever but (42:59 - 43:03)
I mean I I think (43:02 - 43:05)
it's cool to see a good thing you you (43:03 - 43:07)
hear all the time that it's it's it's (43:05 - 43:10)
harder to get new people to jump on (43:07 - 43:13)
board than it is to you know as much as (43:10 - 43:15)
we've heard about frame rate issues and (43:13 - 43:18)
slow down and Graphics which I agree (43:15 - 43:21)
with I think it's all bad yeah we don't (43:18 - 43:23)
need to spend more time on it no we (43:21 - 43:24)
probably will but it's bad we will but (43:23 - 43:26)
hopefully you get a patch but you hear (43:24 - 43:28)
about all that stuff and you know people (43:26 - 43:30)
are still pushing through it because (43:28 - 43:31)
they enjoy the gameplay so much myself (43:30 - 43:34)
included I enjoy the loop that they've (43:31 - 43:38)
created so much that I will I will deal (43:34 - 43:40)
with uh (43:38 - 43:42)
the issues (43:40 - 43:47)
uh many many issues but (43:42 - 43:51)
I I do see how they're trying to get new (43:47 - 43:53)
people into the game (43:51 - 43:54)
um and that's cool like totally (43:53 - 43:56)
understand somebody's Pokemon some (43:54 - 43:58)
that's a game is always somebody's first (43:56 - 43:59)
Pokemon game right some people started (43:58 - 44:01)
with Ruby and Sapphire somebody people (43:59 - 44:02)
start with black and white some people (44:01 - 44:04)
started with sun and moon right somebody (44:02 - 44:07)
you gotta start somewhere (44:04 - 44:09)
um so I I respect that another great (44:07 - 44:12)
thing they did is bulk buying I don't (44:09 - 44:13)
know if you've tried guys have tried (44:12 - 44:15)
this but if you go into one of the menus (44:13 - 44:16)
because there's not really stores to go (44:15 - 44:18)
into uh you can hit the plus button and (44:16 - 44:20)
you can add a bunch of stuff and then (44:18 - 44:21)
you get like a little receipt which is (44:20 - 44:23)
kind of cool that you can review and (44:21 - 44:25)
then you can buy so no more doing like (44:23 - 44:30)
10 10 pokeballs then confirm 10 uh (44:25 - 44:32)
bananas chin confirmed you can just do (44:30 - 44:35)
10 bananas 10 strawberries 10 hams ten (44:32 - 44:38)
like it's great yeah shopping cart (44:35 - 44:41)
it's still the same amount of clicking (44:38 - 44:44)
it's just the time of processing is (44:41 - 44:46)
slightly less it's not that great you (44:44 - 44:48)
are still having to hit the same amount (44:46 - 44:50)
of buttons for the same thing and all (44:48 - 44:53)
you're doing is saving one tiny bit of (44:50 - 44:54)
it you're setting one button between (44:53 - 44:56)
each person but yeah because you're (44:54 - 45:00)
exactly the confirm button yeah yeah it (44:56 - 45:01)
adds up over time yeah if you had 10 (45:00 - 45:03)
things your cart that's 10 less buttons (45:01 - 45:04)
you're pressing three years from now we (45:03 - 45:06)
can talk about how much time was saved (45:04 - 45:08)
because you didn't have to click that (45:06 - 45:11)
extra button you're saving the time in (45:08 - 45:13)
the the bulk purchasing that you're (45:11 - 45:17)
losing in your game stuttering yeah (45:13 - 45:20)
when your game crashed three times today (45:17 - 45:22)
like mine did (45:20 - 45:27)
um yeah I'm 30 30 hours in Greg (45:22 - 45:29)
two crashes (45:27 - 45:32)
what are you at uh I'm about to say (45:29 - 45:34)
about I'm about the same amount of hours (45:32 - 45:35)
and I'm at three (45:34 - 45:37)
Bobby I'm about I'm only about six hours (45:35 - 45:40)
in at this point at zero crashes oh wow (45:37 - 45:43)
going straight back in next to it yeah (45:40 - 45:45)
we'll wait to get towards that game I (45:43 - 45:48)
will say the finals are crashings in (45:45 - 45:51)
sword and shield in 2 000 hours and (45:48 - 45:53)
three years two crashes in sword and (45:51 - 45:55)
shield 30 hours (45:53 - 45:58)
three days two crashes in scarlet and (45:55 - 45:59)
violet they front loaded them for you (45:58 - 46:00)
and Scarlet and violet no more you'll (45:59 - 46:04)
have no more right yeah (46:00 - 46:04)
I don't remember having crashes in (46:04 - 46:09)
Scarlet yeah (46:06 - 46:10)
um I don't remember that I don't (46:09 - 46:12)
remember having any yeah I didn't have (46:10 - 46:13)
it I didn't think I have any had any (46:12 - 46:15)
either but I think I only had a total of (46:13 - 46:16)
like (46:15 - 46:18)
three or four hundred hours into those (46:16 - 46:21)
games compared to Steve's 2 000 hours (46:18 - 46:24)
yeah I put a put a lot in (46:21 - 46:25)
um (46:24 - 46:29)
uh breeding has been moved to picnics (46:25 - 46:32)
which uh I think is a positive right I I (46:29 - 46:33)
really haven't actually heard anyone say (46:32 - 46:35)
anything negative you pretty much have (46:33 - 46:37)
the daycare with you anywhere you go (46:35 - 46:39)
yeah which is I think is actually great (46:37 - 46:40)
and you know if you want to change the (46:39 - 46:43)
scenery go to the beach or go to uh the (46:40 - 46:47)
snow caps or go to the swamp area if you (46:43 - 46:48)
want (46:47 - 46:51)
um instead of being on steps (46:48 - 46:54)
for eggs which is like you spinning in a (46:51 - 46:58)
circle the eggs have time now uh which I (46:54 - 47:00)
I'm just gonna give General examples (46:58 - 47:02)
right like a Magikarp egg could be like (47:00 - 47:04)
once you get the egg it takes one minute (47:02 - 47:06)
for it to hatch one minute real time (47:04 - 47:09)
instead of a hundred steps and like a (47:06 - 47:11)
Lapras egg might take three minutes (47:09 - 47:13)
because Lapras is harder to hatch than (47:11 - 47:16)
Magikarp instead of 3 000 steps I those (47:13 - 47:19)
numbers are just an example (47:16 - 47:21)
um now flame body does work with this (47:19 - 47:24)
there was a during the leaks there was (47:21 - 47:25)
somebody being like Oh flame body (47:24 - 47:27)
doesn't work and it got retweeted and (47:25 - 47:28)
everyone was like oh flame buddy flame (47:27 - 47:30)
Body Works that they were wrong flame (47:28 - 47:34)
body armor Mega armor magma armor and I (47:30 - 47:36)
think what's the last one steam engine (47:34 - 47:38)
um which doesn't matter because (47:36 - 47:40)
brolically it has both of them so you're (47:38 - 47:44)
set either way uh those will work with (47:40 - 47:47)
it as well as it will stack with the (47:44 - 47:49)
sandwich (47:47 - 47:51)
egg thing so you can this is this is (47:49 - 47:53)
probably (47:51 - 47:56)
um I I again I haven't spent uh any time (47:53 - 47:59)
doing the egg stuff yet but Masuda (47:56 - 48:00)
Method is still in it so if you have (47:59 - 48:03)
shiny charm one in five twelve but this (48:00 - 48:05)
from everything I've read from every (48:03 - 48:07)
review from every person I've talked to (48:05 - 48:10)
this is by far the fastest best way to (48:07 - 48:14)
hatch eggs and you can do it anywhere (48:10 - 48:18)
so that's what people are saying I I (48:14 - 48:20)
haven't dove in I haven't played when (48:18 - 48:23)
I've heard it's better (48:20 - 48:24)
um which you know for years I've been (48:23 - 48:26)
saying I would like the egg thing to be (48:24 - 48:28)
a little bit different I don't think (48:26 - 48:30)
this is completely it is different it is (48:28 - 48:33)
different something yeah it is different (48:30 - 48:34)
so (48:33 - 48:36)
um again it seems it seems like people (48:34 - 48:38)
like it the eggs still have to be like (48:36 - 48:40)
like (48:38 - 48:41)
do they still have to be in your party (48:40 - 48:44)
the similar similarly to or does it not (48:41 - 48:46)
matter because (48:44 - 48:48)
I believe the eggs have to be in your (48:46 - 48:49)
party yes or there's no timer running (48:48 - 48:50)
right like if it's like (48:49 - 48:52)
you know before if you have eggs that (48:50 - 48:55)
are uh your party's full then it goes to (48:52 - 48:56)
your box right so that's automatic in (48:55 - 48:58)
this game yeah but it's not like while (48:56 - 49:00)
it's in box it will the timer still runs (48:58 - 49:02)
on it so you could have like a bunch of (49:00 - 49:03)
stuff in your box and then have them (49:02 - 49:06)
hatch yeah I believe you have to put (49:03 - 49:08)
them into your party to hatch yes (49:06 - 49:10)
because that's the only thing the only (49:08 - 49:13)
thing I I I have I don't (49:10 - 49:16)
like about it is that you have One Less (49:13 - 49:18)
Egg space potentially (49:16 - 49:19)
because you have to have two those two (49:18 - 49:21)
in your party at the picnic (49:19 - 49:23)
which two (49:21 - 49:25)
if you have your picnic open which is (49:23 - 49:26)
the which are the two that you're trying (49:25 - 49:28)
to breed together (49:26 - 49:30)
oh well you could just breed them (49:28 - 49:33)
together and then do the thing where (49:30 - 49:35)
your your PC is full of eggs and then (49:33 - 49:37)
remove those put in the roll yeah yeah I (49:35 - 49:39)
see what I'm saying but like (49:37 - 49:43)
in that time yeah there aren't you you (49:39 - 49:44)
don't have them in your party whereas (49:43 - 49:46)
the old daycare thing is you could load (49:44 - 49:48)
up and still go around while they were (49:46 - 49:51)
in a factory that that Loop is gone (49:48 - 49:53)
which I'm not overly thrilled about but (49:51 - 49:54)
I've heard everything else about it is (49:53 - 49:58)
better so yeah I I we will report back (49:54 - 49:59)
um I mean Greg and I have done a lot of (49:58 - 50:02)
breeding will does a lot of breeding too (49:59 - 50:04)
um so I actually be curious what his (50:02 - 50:06)
take would be but we'll wait like three (50:04 - 50:10)
months until he gets there uh if yeah if (50:06 - 50:13)
he gets there (50:10 - 50:15)
oh there's something else that they (50:13 - 50:21)
change uh at the blue Tara (50:15 - 50:25)
Tara raid stuff so we were right and we (50:21 - 50:28)
were wrong I said I would admit if I was (50:25 - 50:31)
wrong I was wrong you can change Terror (50:28 - 50:35)
types which is incredibly surprising I (50:31 - 50:36)
thought for sure they would save this (50:35 - 50:39)
for DLC now to be fair by the time you (50:36 - 50:42)
try to change one Terror type the DLC (50:39 - 50:44)
will be out uh yeah maybe it'll be (50:42 - 50:47)
easier because how you change Terror (50:44 - 50:50)
types is that you need to get 50 (50:47 - 50:53)
crystals of that Terror type so (50:50 - 50:54)
um if you're playing through Scarlet (50:53 - 50:56)
Violet right now you've maybe found one (50:54 - 50:58)
or two they seem to put a Terra Crystal (50:56 - 51:02)
near the gym just to like give you like (50:58 - 51:03)
it's just on the ground usually behind (51:02 - 51:05)
the gym or you know nearby (51:03 - 51:06)
um (51:05 - 51:08)
but there's a there's a city that you'll (51:06 - 51:10)
be able to go to they'll talk about Tara (51:08 - 51:12)
it's actually really cute and I think (51:10 - 51:16)
Super clever I I I think it was great it (51:12 - 51:18)
was presented very well (51:16 - 51:20)
um and ideally you you take let's say (51:18 - 51:22)
you have a Pikachu who is uh electric (51:20 - 51:23)
type and you want that Pikachu to be (51:22 - 51:27)
fire you have to find 50 fire terror (51:23 - 51:30)
crystals which is a lot a lot and I talk (51:27 - 51:32)
a lot I've talked to people who have (51:30 - 51:34)
already beat the game who are like yep (51:32 - 51:37)
I'm 30 hours in I have three uh all (51:34 - 51:40)
reviewers I've watched they're like this (51:37 - 51:42)
is going to take you forever if you want (51:40 - 51:44)
to do it and (51:42 - 51:46)
um you take the 50 crystals you'll be (51:44 - 51:48)
able to change Pikachu from Electric to (51:46 - 51:51)
fire boom done so (51:48 - 51:53)
yeah I mean like maybe by the time the (51:51 - 51:55)
DLC comes out you'll be able to change (51:53 - 51:57)
like two or three depending on how much (51:55 - 52:01)
you play I have found (51:57 - 52:03)
one fairy crystal (52:01 - 52:05)
and one water (52:03 - 52:07)
yeah I'm 30 hours in I think I have (52:05 - 52:09)
three flying (52:07 - 52:11)
that's it don't even need it that's it (52:09 - 52:13)
now (52:11 - 52:18)
so harder raids uh like the five-star uh (52:13 - 52:21)
four-star uh they will drop crystals so (52:18 - 52:23)
you could grind out like I'm just going (52:21 - 52:25)
to do fire raids to drop fire crystals (52:23 - 52:27)
to eventually change it I think look (52:25 - 52:29)
it's it's great that there's no (52:27 - 52:31)
complaints it's great that it's there (52:29 - 52:34)
um and by making it rare they're not (52:31 - 52:37)
invalidating you doing raids like oh I (52:34 - 52:39)
don't need to do any raids because then (52:37 - 52:41)
I'll I just want my gold duck and I just (52:39 - 52:42)
want him to be psychic because Golduck (52:41 - 52:44)
should be like (52:42 - 52:47)
I'm sure like like bottle caps like (52:44 - 52:49)
mints like ability capsules they will (52:47 - 52:52)
make it easier as time goes on right (52:49 - 52:55)
like of course Isle of armor DLC they're (52:52 - 52:57)
putting mints everywhere in the ground (52:55 - 52:58)
right (52:57 - 53:00)
um so I'm assuming if this game gets DLC (52:58 - 53:02)
assuming that it sells well enough (53:00 - 53:05)
because of the issues and uh that it (53:02 - 53:07)
will be easier but you know if you're (53:05 - 53:09)
really if there's a you know a Shiny (53:07 - 53:12)
Pokemon you got you really love it it (53:09 - 53:14)
has a mark it has all this stuff you (53:12 - 53:16)
really want to grind out it is a really (53:14 - 53:18)
it's an achievable thing that you can do (53:16 - 53:20)
so I don't really I'm just surprised (53:18 - 53:23)
that it was here in base game (53:20 - 53:25)
but I guess they kind of weighed it with (53:23 - 53:26)
the (53:25 - 53:28)
we're gonna make you really we're gonna (53:26 - 53:30)
be yeah it might as well not be in base (53:28 - 53:33)
game it's barely here in Bay's game if (53:30 - 53:36)
it's that hard to actually like do it (53:33 - 53:38)
now now the thing that I was (53:36 - 53:41)
you know I said hey I don't think those (53:38 - 53:42)
Tara poke I don't think those Super (53:41 - 53:44)
Saiyan Pokemon on the route are going to (53:42 - 53:47)
be this thing that everyone thinks (53:44 - 53:48)
um they were what I thought they were (53:47 - 53:51)
which is static Pokemon that do not (53:48 - 53:56)
change the Pokemon that I fought in the (53:51 - 54:00)
demo was a terror type bug level 40. if (53:56 - 54:02)
you go I I don't want again we're not (54:00 - 54:04)
spoiling Pokemon if you go there in the (54:02 - 54:07)
swamp where they are they are level 40 (54:04 - 54:10)
bug type for everyone (54:07 - 54:12)
it's been three days in a row they're (54:10 - 54:13)
still bug type (54:12 - 54:16)
there's a there's a weasel uh weasel's (54:13 - 54:18)
not spoiler we all know who weasels we (54:16 - 54:21)
all played 17 Gen 4 games uh that (54:18 - 54:23)
weasel's always ice type everyone for (54:21 - 54:26)
everyone Greg ice type (54:23 - 54:27)
all the people in twitch chat ice type (54:26 - 54:29)
all people on Reddit ice type that (54:27 - 54:31)
weasel a week later probably still gonna (54:29 - 54:34)
be ice type though and it and not only (54:31 - 54:35)
that (54:34 - 54:38)
that weasel on that route is the only (54:35 - 54:40)
Super Saiyan Pokemon and it doesn't (54:38 - 54:41)
change (54:40 - 54:45)
uh so you know we were speculating (54:41 - 54:49)
about a week ago that (54:45 - 54:53)
would they be all 18 types would if if (54:49 - 54:55)
weasel's glowing is Jigglypuff not (54:53 - 54:57)
glowing can you have two glowing Pokemon (54:55 - 55:00)
nope it is just like the wild Aryan (54:57 - 55:01)
sword and shield Snorlax is always going (55:00 - 55:03)
to spawn here he's always going to be (55:01 - 55:04)
this (55:03 - 55:07)
he's just the static spawn of the day (55:04 - 55:11)
I I I hope maybe that those Pokemon (55:07 - 55:13)
rotate monthly Maybe (55:11 - 55:16)
uh yeah I hope they rotate because like (55:13 - 55:18)
I think it's fine right now (55:16 - 55:21)
they're they're you can collect them (55:18 - 55:22)
right you can knock them out get a bunch (55:21 - 55:25)
of LP they're stronger (55:22 - 55:27)
um they do you know they do have (55:25 - 55:30)
different Terror types (55:27 - 55:33)
uh but if in two years that weasel with (55:30 - 55:37)
the ice Crown is still there why like (55:33 - 55:40)
what am I why why would I ever go into (55:37 - 55:42)
that little corner of the map again it's (55:40 - 55:45)
the same weasel yeah whereas like hey (55:42 - 55:47)
maybe you know next month it's a fairy (55:45 - 55:52)
weasel and in January it's a fire weasel (55:47 - 55:54)
and then I think that would be cooler I (55:52 - 55:55)
don't know if that's what they're doing (55:54 - 55:57)
but right now it's fine I think if they (55:55 - 56:00)
stay there forever (55:57 - 56:03)
I don't think that's great right (56:00 - 56:04)
do you think they would switch out the (56:03 - 56:08)
Pokemon or just like the oh yeah I don't (56:04 - 56:10)
know I don't know just yeah yeah maybe (56:08 - 56:12)
they could do a lot of things but yeah I (56:10 - 56:13)
remember one of the YouTube comments (56:12 - 56:16)
well I I read I I read last week which (56:13 - 56:19)
you know I thought we said we didn't (56:16 - 56:21)
look I thought we were clearing not (56:19 - 56:22)
reading spoilers and talking about (56:21 - 56:25)
everything yeah on YouTube comments you (56:22 - 56:27)
were thinking that you weren't going to (56:25 - 56:29)
see spoilers after saying we're not (56:27 - 56:31)
talking about spoilers right yeah you (56:29 - 56:33)
know listening is hard I guess uh but (56:31 - 56:34)
you know in the last week's podcast I (56:33 - 56:36)
was like I doubt you'll have all 18 (56:34 - 56:39)
Terror type critons you can technically (56:36 - 56:43)
have all 18 types it's just (56:39 - 56:47)
that's why why would you change it like (56:43 - 56:48)
you would you would change it to the (56:47 - 56:50)
type you want ideally because you'd (56:48 - 56:52)
either like that type or for competitive (56:50 - 56:54)
reasons but like why would you do the (56:52 - 56:56)
work to change it like to something (56:54 - 56:59)
again to maybe change it back so like (56:56 - 57:02)
yeah you're right every Pokemon can be (56:59 - 57:04)
every type hope you have a lot of time (57:02 - 57:07)
on your hands (57:04 - 57:09)
laughs (57:07 - 57:12)
again I don't think it's bad I just they (57:09 - 57:15)
wanted that stuff to be rare they found (57:12 - 57:17)
a system to make it rare the game just (57:15 - 57:19)
came out I'm not in a rush to start (57:17 - 57:22)
changing everyone's Terror types (57:19 - 57:24)
um it is exciting still like I saw a (57:22 - 57:26)
fire type Dedenne raid very into it I do (57:24 - 57:28)
want to talk about raids we'll end here (57:26 - 57:29)
we'll end here I think this is a good (57:28 - 57:31)
place to end uh (57:29 - 57:34)
surprisingly Co-op works great not (57:31 - 57:37)
broken super surprised blew me away (57:34 - 57:42)
um but the the the raid system in (57:37 - 57:45)
general just so good (57:42 - 57:47)
the raids feel engaging they feel like (57:45 - 57:49)
you're actually doing something I feel (57:47 - 57:51)
like if I look away I'm like hurting my (57:49 - 57:54)
team now the one in two star raids (57:51 - 57:56)
if you've only done those you ain't got (57:54 - 57:59)
like a level five star raid in this game (57:56 - 58:01)
there's level 70. (57:59 - 58:03)
and that's not even including six star (58:01 - 58:05)
raids which I don't know what level and (58:03 - 58:06)
we know that the Seven Star rate is (58:05 - 58:09)
level 100 and we'll experience that (58:06 - 58:12)
um but man a five-star raid feels feels (58:09 - 58:15)
to me like that Mewtwo raid felt in (58:12 - 58:17)
sword and shield and it was very (58:15 - 58:19)
enjoyable like to the point where I was (58:17 - 58:21)
like I'm the lowest level hey I'm gonna (58:19 - 58:24)
cheer to like put up defenses I will be (58:21 - 58:25)
the one that heals don't worry about (58:24 - 58:27)
healing just worry about like it felt (58:25 - 58:29)
great (58:27 - 58:34)
um and yeah I I I I I'm excited so (58:29 - 58:36)
a couple things about the co-op thing (58:34 - 58:38)
that I discovered have you (58:36 - 58:41)
co-opt with a different have you Union (58:38 - 58:43)
scored with a different version of your (58:41 - 58:45)
game no not yet I've had two people come (58:43 - 58:47)
to my game and I they they were having a (58:45 - 58:48)
blast I don't know what they were doing (58:47 - 58:51)
here doing something here's the thing so (58:48 - 58:54)
uh a friend of mine (58:51 - 58:57)
Scarlet Violet we went to an area he's (58:54 - 59:00)
like oh my rare spawns are here (58:57 - 59:02)
my version exclusives are here and so we (59:00 - 59:05)
went there turns out (59:02 - 59:08)
my version exclusives also started (59:05 - 59:10)
spawning there so if you have two (59:08 - 59:12)
different versions in your earnings (59:10 - 59:15)
Union squaring you get to see the other (59:12 - 59:17)
versions exclusives in your game which (59:15 - 59:20)
is cool yeah it's great you get to go (59:17 - 59:22)
around to be like oh that's not my game (59:20 - 59:25)
I'm with my friends now we get to catch (59:22 - 59:27)
everything (59:25 - 59:29)
we can run around the map together we (59:27 - 59:31)
can go you can I can say oh my this one (59:29 - 59:34)
spawns here let's all go over here and (59:31 - 59:36)
you have a chance of catching it on your (59:34 - 59:38)
own without me having to trade it to you (59:36 - 59:40)
awesome feature (59:38 - 59:43)
yeah and thoughts on the do you have how (59:40 - 59:45)
many raids have you done Greg I did a (59:43 - 59:47)
bunch of writes um I met they're still (59:45 - 59:49)
low level to me so they're they are (59:47 - 59:51)
they're like instantly opening yeah (59:49 - 59:52)
they're they're nothing they don't feel (59:51 - 59:55)
they don't feel significantly different (59:52 - 59:59)
at low levels they just feel like okay (59:55 - 60:00)
cool yeah (59:59 - 60:02)
um for me it's like they might even get (60:00 - 60:04)
to attack and it's done yeah yeah they (60:02 - 60:07)
look great like they look (60:04 - 60:11)
great except everybody looks the same (60:07 - 60:11)
um (60:11 - 60:16)
the combos like we found some fun combos (60:12 - 60:18)
I'm like oh that's fun yeah I want I (60:16 - 60:20)
want in on that you know that sounds (60:18 - 60:22)
like a that sounds like a cool Terror (60:20 - 60:24)
type on that particular Pokemon yeah (60:22 - 60:25)
I'll do that one (60:24 - 60:27)
um I don't I can't say that the wycom (60:25 - 60:30)
system is any better but oh I disagree I (60:27 - 60:32)
think the Union Square is so good (60:30 - 60:34)
comparison the Union Park coming (60:32 - 60:36)
together is but like when you just go to (60:34 - 60:38)
a random the random raid screen I'm like (60:36 - 60:41)
okay (60:38 - 60:41)
I have as many issues getting into those (60:45 - 60:51)
as I've ever had yeah I I that's (60:48 - 60:53)
probably chalked up to just they fail so (60:51 - 60:54)
fast and there's so many people playing (60:53 - 60:56)
I think that would probably work itself (60:54 - 60:59)
out I think though like the the the (60:56 - 61:00)
thing in sword and shield and I asked (60:59 - 61:02)
them to send her up this you know back (61:00 - 61:03)
two months ago I was like hey do they (61:02 - 61:05)
have to be on my friends list or is it (61:03 - 61:06)
like Dynamax adventures in the crown (61:05 - 61:07)
Tundra where they can just enter a code (61:06 - 61:09)
and they're like they can just enter a (61:07 - 61:11)
code they're like we're not 100 sure but (61:09 - 61:12)
you should be able to just I was like (61:11 - 61:14)
okay well I'm gonna trust you guys they (61:12 - 61:15)
were right (61:14 - 61:18)
um for me to go over to hey I have a (61:15 - 61:20)
fire type Dedenne I'm gonna open it up (61:18 - 61:23)
to everyone it auto makes a code and (61:20 - 61:25)
boom I don't even have to like make a (61:23 - 61:26)
code it's six digits it's not eight (61:25 - 61:27)
digits (61:26 - 61:28)
um don't have to worry about like one (61:27 - 61:30)
one one one one one one one eight eight (61:28 - 61:33)
eight eight it's it it it and it works (61:30 - 61:35)
great (61:33 - 61:37)
um and I would assume any issues I would (61:35 - 61:39)
assume any issues would be related to (61:37 - 61:42)
memory or frame rate or Ram that would (61:39 - 61:46)
affect the whole game and or just a huge (61:42 - 61:48)
surplus of people trying to get in right (61:46 - 61:49)
now (61:48 - 61:54)
um but I you know the game has issues no (61:49 - 61:55)
doubt and we could talk about the issues (61:54 - 61:57)
I want to be a little more positive this (61:55 - 62:00)
episode but gonna give game free credit (61:57 - 62:02)
where credit's due yeah this internet (62:00 - 62:05)
stuff is better than why com (62:02 - 62:08)
and I didn't think they'd be able to do (62:05 - 62:11)
that yeah is the game is like the frame (62:08 - 62:13)
rate stuff any worse when you're in (62:11 - 62:17)
Co-op oh oh the the the bugs I have in (62:13 - 62:19)
Co-op are way worse than me playing on (62:17 - 62:21)
my own (62:19 - 62:22)
yeah I can't answer that question (62:21 - 62:24)
because when I was in Co-op I was just (62:22 - 62:26)
literally standing still talking to (62:24 - 62:27)
people and the two people in my Co-op (62:26 - 62:28)
game they were they were doing (62:27 - 62:30)
everything but I you know I was still (62:28 - 62:31)
able to encounter I was still able to (62:30 - 62:33)
leave I was still able to evolve Pokemon (62:31 - 62:35)
with and they they had their own thing (62:33 - 62:37)
so that was cool like it it works (62:35 - 62:39)
honestly it works better than I thought (62:37 - 62:43)
it it you you connect fine but I have (62:39 - 62:47)
noticed on multiple ends the bugs that (62:43 - 62:50)
you are seeing online like oh that never (62:47 - 62:53)
happened in my game that happens a lot (62:50 - 62:55)
when you are connected to somebody (62:53 - 62:57)
else's game yeah because I just think (62:55 - 62:59)
about it I had my friend literally (62:57 - 63:01)
riding around in the air for an entire (62:59 - 63:04)
20 minutes because (63:01 - 63:06)
yeah I'm just like okay cool you're on (63:04 - 63:09)
you're on an invisible bike right now I (63:06 - 63:11)
guess (63:09 - 63:12)
um because I just go I think back to (63:11 - 63:14)
like sword and shield right and when (63:12 - 63:17)
you're in uh the wild area and you (63:14 - 63:19)
connect online or anything like that and (63:17 - 63:20)
you have all the other people that are (63:19 - 63:23)
there is right well right like every but (63:20 - 63:25)
that was a time when like (63:23 - 63:27)
for a smooth smooth as that game ran (63:25 - 63:29)
like you would run into issues there (63:27 - 63:30)
like oh yeah you would see bikes go (63:29 - 63:32)
through trees or just oh yeah so if it's (63:30 - 63:34)
like with the issues that the game (63:32 - 63:36)
already has and then you're adding into (63:34 - 63:39)
let's connect to the internet and see (63:36 - 63:43)
what else goes wrong well I mean unlike (63:39 - 63:46)
Sergeant Shield you uh I when I I run (63:43 - 63:48)
around connect to the Internet so I can (63:46 - 63:52)
do raids it is just me unless I invite (63:48 - 63:54)
people into my game sure right people (63:52 - 63:56)
don't pop in I don't have random (63:54 - 63:59)
strangers running around I don't have (63:56 - 64:00)
any of that crazy because when people (63:59 - 64:02)
were popping in and out in sword and (64:00 - 64:03)
shield like it didn't look great I'm not (64:02 - 64:05)
gonna sit like it it like it was it was (64:03 - 64:06)
glitchy you would see somebody just (64:05 - 64:08)
driving the air because the cliff ended (64:06 - 64:10)
where you would see people drive through (64:08 - 64:11)
walls and stuff but like this game (64:10 - 64:13)
doesn't even have that and it's running (64:11 - 64:16)
worse and right like there's no like (64:13 - 64:19)
there's there's at times in scarlet and (64:16 - 64:20)
violet where it's like you're in this (64:19 - 64:22)
big beautiful open well I I don't think (64:20 - 64:23)
the game is beautiful I actually think (64:22 - 64:26)
the game is is can be buddy and and kind (64:23 - 64:27)
of ugly at times I think there are (64:26 - 64:29)
moments where the game looks good but (64:27 - 64:31)
you're in this big world and you're (64:29 - 64:32)
immersed with all these Pokemon around (64:31 - 64:34)
you but at the same time it kind of also (64:32 - 64:35)
feels empty because you don't have those (64:34 - 64:37)
people around you and yeah there's just (64:35 - 64:39)
not a lot of pain and I think one of the (64:37 - 64:40)
weaker parts of why I don't think the (64:39 - 64:43)
game particularly looks good is because (64:40 - 64:45)
I I don't feel like a lot of the areas (64:43 - 64:47)
are memorable (64:45 - 64:50)
um they're like like the stuff in (64:47 - 64:52)
between kind of like it's filled with (64:50 - 64:53)
Pokemon and it's filled with trees and (64:52 - 64:55)
rivers and grass but like (64:53 - 64:58)
I I kind of have a suspicion that people (64:55 - 65:00)
are getting lost because there's no like (64:58 - 65:03)
landmarks that they can like kind of (65:00 - 65:04)
think of like I there there's the (65:03 - 65:06)
graphite eye Forest (65:04 - 65:09)
which is doesn't look very pretty (65:06 - 65:12)
honestly but (65:09 - 65:12)
that area looks really muddy because (65:14 - 65:18)
it's more shaded (65:16 - 65:20)
and you have the symbols on the trees (65:18 - 65:22)
and you're like oh graphite I4 so that (65:20 - 65:24)
part becomes memorable because they're (65:22 - 65:25)
the only trees in the game with the the (65:24 - 65:28)
the symbols on it but (65:25 - 65:30)
um (65:28 - 65:30)
like (65:31 - 65:35)
you don't you don't have that elsewhere (65:33 - 65:37)
you don't have like these like something (65:35 - 65:41)
to be like this makes this part unique (65:37 - 65:44)
um I mean I disagree but (65:41 - 65:44)
yeah I guess we should talk more but (65:45 - 65:49)
yeah (65:47 - 65:52)
um yeah but I do I do think one of the (65:49 - 65:54)
one of the problems is (65:52 - 65:57)
the world is so big and they did not put (65:54 - 66:00)
in enough landmarks right yes like sorry (65:57 - 66:01)
I think that was the point I was making (66:00 - 66:04)
Greg yeah like if you are in the middle (66:01 - 66:05)
of Wyoming (66:04 - 66:07)
there's not a lot of landmarks there and (66:05 - 66:09)
it all looks the same like I can't like (66:07 - 66:12)
it is a it is a real world and an (66:09 - 66:14)
in-game problem that they could have (66:12 - 66:16)
fixed by putting in much larger (66:14 - 66:20)
landmarks now to be fair they did put in (66:16 - 66:21)
Towers (66:20 - 66:24)
unfortunately I look the same all the (66:21 - 66:26)
Towers look the same like they didn't (66:24 - 66:29)
they didn't sort of consider (66:26 - 66:31)
changing those enough to make them (66:29 - 66:33)
landmarks like it's the key to why (66:31 - 66:35)
Disney World works why you why people (66:33 - 66:38)
never feel like they've walked very far (66:35 - 66:40)
or for that long in Disney World because (66:38 - 66:43)
the giant castle is in the middle so you (66:40 - 66:45)
always have a focal point that (66:43 - 66:48)
gets your mind off of how long you've (66:45 - 66:49)
actually been walking because you're (66:48 - 66:51)
always walking towards something big and (66:49 - 66:53)
cool and that's something they did not (66:51 - 66:56)
do in this game until you get close to (66:53 - 66:59)
one of their cities and the cities are (66:56 - 67:03)
memorable but they needed to put in more (66:59 - 67:05)
important (67:03 - 67:08)
landmarks along the way so that you (67:05 - 67:10)
didn't notice how long you were (67:08 - 67:13)
traveling of just Countryside because (67:10 - 67:14)
there's a lot of yeah there's a lot of (67:13 - 67:15)
distance between those like you're (67:14 - 67:17)
saying a lot of distance it's noticeable (67:15 - 67:20)
because it's because you don't have (67:17 - 67:22)
something different I guess yeah you (67:20 - 67:24)
don't have something to say oh I'm (67:22 - 67:26)
heading there because a lot of the times (67:24 - 67:28)
you're like I'm heading towards a flag (67:26 - 67:30)
that I put on that's not actually in the (67:28 - 67:33)
world I can't see it when I'm playing I (67:30 - 67:35)
can only see it in my mini-map and that (67:33 - 67:38)
psychologically makes it feel like (67:35 - 67:40)
you're really traveling way too far (67:38 - 67:42)
which is part of their game plan to make (67:40 - 67:44)
you feel like you're in a huge expansive (67:42 - 67:47)
world but it kind of backfires because (67:44 - 67:50)
the world feels without other people and (67:47 - 67:53)
without Landmark a lot of the areas feel (67:50 - 67:56)
empty yes so I agree with Greg then (67:53 - 67:58)
completely without the people and (67:56 - 68:00)
without the landmarks yeah the world (67:58 - 68:03)
feels weird but I do think the the (68:00 - 68:06)
pockets of areas that they created feel (68:03 - 68:09)
unique like I know which side of the map (68:06 - 68:13)
I'm on by the landscape they built but I (68:09 - 68:15)
couldn't tell you A lot of the times (68:13 - 68:18)
where in that landscape I'm like I know (68:15 - 68:21)
I'm in this area right somewhere and I (68:18 - 68:23)
have no Landmark to tell me exactly (68:21 - 68:25)
where I am I'm in the north part of the (68:23 - 68:27)
map because there's snow because there's (68:25 - 68:29)
snow (68:27 - 68:29)
