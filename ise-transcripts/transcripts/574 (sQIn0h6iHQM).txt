75 (0:45 - 0:52)
we're so past those quarter marks (0:47 - 0:55)

we've been around the block been around (0:55 - 0:58)
the block a few times (0:56 - 1:00)
speaking about going around the block (0:58 - 1:02)
Hannah's here (1:00 - 1:04)
kinda I've been playing the new Pokemon (1:02 - 1:08)
go event that's the closest I get (1:04 - 1:08)
I do I hate it I want to love it oh boy (1:08 - 1:17)
I it's one of my favorite colors I love (1:14 - 1:19)
the design I have no idea why the center (1:17 - 1:21)
of the design isn't on my solar plexus (1:19 - 1:23)
it needs to be up higher I may try and (1:21 - 1:25)
get it adjusted it absolutely does need (1:23 - 1:27)
to be higher but I don't think that's (1:25 - 1:32)
how all of them are but it's bad (1:27 - 1:32)
and no it's bad but it would be one of (1:32 - 1:37)
my favorite Pokemon shirts ever if the (1:35 - 1:41)
design was just three inches higher (1:37 - 1:43)
I understand now (1:41 - 1:45)
there are odd for our audio listeners (1:43 - 1:47)
it's just the design is very low on the (1:45 - 1:50)
shirt it's yeah it's not like Superman (1:47 - 1:52)
logo it's very the center of the (1:50 - 1:54)
Pokeball is on your yeah it is very (1:52 - 1:57)
center of your body which is not just (1:54 - 1:59)
where you want your designs to be it's (1:57 - 2:03)
very poly whirl yes yes it's very poly (1:59 - 2:05)
whirl and not Superman and it needs to (2:03 - 2:08)
be more Superman and less polywhirl (2:05 - 2:09)
exactly (2:08 - 2:12)
okay uh we do have some stuff to talk (2:09 - 2:16)

I should never order from Nintendo Yes (3:14 - 3:19)
just period there's a lesson to be (3:17 - 3:20)
learned here from anything I always (3:19 - 3:23)
remember that after and I'm like well I (3:20 - 3:26)
don't really I don't really care how (3:23 - 3:28)
quickly I get this device and that sort (3:26 - 3:32)

they are running a shop business because (3:32 - 3:35)
I called them like it has not even (3:34 - 3:37)
processed they're like well it doesn't (3:35 - 3:40)

because it doesn't come out till (3:48 - 3:51)
tomorrow (3:49 - 3:55)
yeah yeah but you know it's coming you (3:51 - 3:57)
you could do all of this in preparation (3:55 - 4:01)
you could get ahead of the Curve well we (3:57 - 4:05)
no you'll see it I'm like you know what (4:01 - 4:08)
we're done fine I'm not we we don't need (4:05 - 4:10)

Thursday okay preparing to ship (4:20 - 4:25)
preparing to ship (4:22 - 4:30)
uh yeah I mean like it's it we we should (4:25 - 4:32)
come in no surprise that like nothing (4:30 - 4:36)
from Pokemon Center or Nintendo will (4:32 - 4:38)
ever hit release date maybe if you're (4:36 - 4:40)
like super lucky maybe like if you're in (4:38 - 4:44)
throwing distance of like (4:40 - 4:44)
he doesn't even do it anymore (4:45 - 4:50)
he's retired he retired he retired his (4:48 - 4:52)
pitching arm (4:50 - 4:54)
but also like (4:52 - 4:56)
I was at Mall of America yesterday (4:54 - 4:58)
because my life is unfortunate and I (4:56 - 4:59)
have to end up there a lot look there's (4:58 - 5:01)
just a lot of stores that they have all (4:59 - 5:02)
in one place (5:01 - 5:05)
there's a better there's a better you (5:02 - 5:07)
just go to Southdale the prices are (5:05 - 5:10)
cheaper and it's a better Mall (5:07 - 5:12)
uh but yeah I always do my I always do a (5:10 - 5:14)
lap though like (5:12 - 5:16)
it gives me like the I do my lap I get (5:14 - 5:19)
my sip Club I hit up the stores (5:16 - 5:21)
easier and easy out it's actually really (5:19 - 5:23)
easy to get well on a weekday it's very (5:21 - 5:24)
easy to get in and out of Mall of (5:23 - 5:29)
America at a weekend nope (5:24 - 5:29)
um (5:29 - 5:32)
but GameStop had a bunch they had like (5:30 - 5:34)
six on their shelf and I was like I (5:32 - 5:36)
guess I'll like (5:34 - 5:38)
I want to talk about on the show and I (5:36 - 5:39)
already have like a handful coming to me (5:38 - 5:41)
so I guess I'll pick it up because they (5:39 - 5:42)
literally have it insurance which is (5:41 - 5:44)
kind of crazy to think about because one (5:42 - 5:46)
it's sold out everywhere at Best Buy (5:44 - 5:48)
Nintendo where Pokemon say like it was (5:46 - 5:51)
sold out everywhere (5:48 - 5:53)
and even though I think all three of us (5:51 - 5:55)
pre-ordered in what March February (5:53 - 5:59)
February February 27th yep how do you (5:55 - 6:00)
pre-order something in February and then (5:59 - 6:03)
it still is late (6:00 - 6:06)
this is what I call customer service for (6:03 - 6:10)
this is this is what I was saying to (6:06 - 6:14)
Nintendo Customer Service how how how do (6:10 - 6:16)
you not know how to run a retail (6:14 - 6:18)
business huh how does give stuff out of (6:16 - 6:21)
all locations have them in stock (6:18 - 6:24)
and I honestly the Best Buy has them in (6:21 - 6:26)
stock too any place that is physical (6:24 - 6:27)
store that would need to get them in (6:26 - 6:30)
stock by release date because that's who (6:27 - 6:31)
they care about getting them to by (6:30 - 6:33)
release date they probably have them in (6:31 - 6:36)
stock so I I did I did three at Best Buy (6:33 - 6:39)
because they went they they went up on (6:36 - 6:42)
Best Buy in February I did three one for (6:39 - 6:45)
me one for me when I lose one and then (6:42 - 6:48)
one for me to keep in my box so then I (6:45 - 6:51)
can sell it alongside my ancient Mew and (6:48 - 6:54)
then retire understand you gotta you (6:51 - 6:56)
gotta let it appreciate a little bit you (6:54 - 6:57)
gotta put in the closet next to the (6:56 - 6:59)
ancient mute but you knew Burger King (6:57 - 7:02)
gold Pokemon coins you gotta let it (6:59 - 7:04)
build up in value like this detective (7:02 - 7:06)
Pikachu cartridge that I inherited yeah (7:04 - 7:10)
yeah yeah that's my it's only going up (7:06 - 7:12)
it's the only God it's only when when (7:10 - 7:15)
two comes out I'm gonna sell this and (7:12 - 7:18)
say look it's moved on to its new owner (7:15 - 7:20)
you can't speak to me you need to speak (7:18 - 7:23)
to his new owner so I did in-store (7:20 - 7:27)
pickup for Best Buy back in February and (7:23 - 7:29)
Thursday night they sent me a a push (7:27 - 7:31)
notification because I got the Best Buy (7:29 - 7:33)
app and it's like hey just to let you (7:31 - 7:35)
know your order's not quite ready but (7:33 - 7:36)
we'll let you know tomorrow and then (7:35 - 7:38)
tomorrow morning then the next morning (7:36 - 7:39)
it was like let she let you know it's (7:38 - 7:41)
not quite ready (7:39 - 7:44)
okay just to let you know and then it (7:41 - 7:46)
gave me an option to ship it to my house (7:44 - 7:47)
and it was like if you switch it to (7:46 - 7:49)
shipping it'll be there on Wednesday and (7:47 - 7:51)
I was like okay I either take Wednesday (7:49 - 7:53)
and you ship it or I'm just gonna keep (7:51 - 7:55)
getting this notification I'm not quite (7:53 - 7:58)
ready every two hours (7:55 - 7:58)
right like right it's not gonna be there (7:59 - 8:05)
um I mean if it does arrive it's not (8:04 - 8:07)
like the weekend Best Buy employees are (8:05 - 8:09)
gonna unpack those packages (8:07 - 8:13)
so I don't know it's I have one now and (8:09 - 8:15)
did you did you Hannah wait did you say (8:13 - 8:17)
you got yours or yours is still no mine (8:15 - 8:19)
is coming on Thursday I seriously (8:17 - 8:21)
considered going to a GameStop to try (8:19 - 8:24)
and get one in person but I already (8:21 - 8:26)
purchased it and I don't want to go (8:24 - 8:27)
through the hassle of returning the (8:26 - 8:30)
Nintendo one there is no amount of (8:27 - 8:32)
Desire (8:30 - 8:34)
for anything (8:32 - 8:36)
that would ever say to myself (8:34 - 8:39)
I'm gonna go to a GameStop and pick this (8:36 - 8:42)
up there is that (8:39 - 8:45)
I know from the minute I walk into that (8:42 - 8:48)
door I am having a miserable experience (8:45 - 8:51)
and I wish I had just waited there's (8:48 - 8:56)
just no amount none like it's bad enough (8:51 - 8:58)
when I have to walk in there and get a (8:56 - 9:00)
code much less go in there and buy (8:58 - 9:02)
something to be told about the 17 (9:00 - 9:05)
million pre-orders that I I wanted this (9:02 - 9:07)
next Call of Duty (9:05 - 9:10)
sure next Call of Duty next Madden next (9:07 - 9:13)
Madden FIFA do you want to buy Final (9:10 - 9:18)
Fantasy not from you I don't (9:13 - 9:20)
I like the pictures so the (9:18 - 9:24)
I I did check to see if Target had any (9:20 - 9:26)
and (9:24 - 9:28)
they have pictures of the product and (9:26 - 9:32)
the one that is the strangest to me is (9:28 - 9:35)
just a pillow in a person's arm holding (9:32 - 9:38)
it on the pillow pushing the button and (9:35 - 9:42)
it makes no sense it's just a detached (9:38 - 9:44)
arm on a pillow (9:42 - 9:46)
what are you doing (9:44 - 9:49)
it's you're thinking it's a sleep device (9:46 - 9:52)
it's good but they have it next to the (9:49 - 9:53)
pillow in the next picture with nobody (9:52 - 9:56)
there (9:53 - 9:59)
uh so I I have it here (9:56 - 10:02)
I heard it buzzes real loud yeah oh oh (9:59 - 10:04)
it does it does okay so this is what I (10:02 - 10:08)
will say uh the hardware very nice the (10:04 - 10:10)
size not as big as I was expecting (10:08 - 10:12)
although it is still rather large (10:10 - 10:15)
um it's rounded on the back which I (10:12 - 10:17)
don't think any of the pictures really (10:15 - 10:19)
showed (10:17 - 10:21)
um so it is very uh (10:19 - 10:24)
uh hockey puck in its design except (10:21 - 10:26)
round I don't know our hockey Puck's (10:24 - 10:30)
like round yeah they're they're around (10:26 - 10:32)
around the circumference but they (10:30 - 10:35)
they're flat they're flat yeah yeah yeah (10:32 - 10:38)
yeah yeah so this is not this is rounded (10:35 - 10:40)
top and bottom I don't know what what to (10:38 - 10:42)
call that a cylinder a disc they're (10:40 - 10:45)
domed doomed (10:42 - 10:48)
domed on the top domed on the bottom (10:45 - 10:50)
um what I don't like (10:48 - 10:52)
is when you put the wrist strap on this (10:50 - 10:54)
is this okay this is so hard for audio (10:52 - 10:55)
listeners whether we were doing a video (10:54 - 10:57)
podcast or not this I still have to (10:55 - 10:58)
explain this when you put the wrist (10:57 - 11:01)
strap on and then you hold it it ends up (10:58 - 11:04)
being upside down (11:01 - 11:07)
but that is how you would hold it (11:04 - 11:09)
because of the wrist strap if you were (11:07 - 11:13)
to turn it around you just I I guess you (11:09 - 11:15)
could do that but like the natural go (11:13 - 11:18)
put it so put the wrist strap so it's on (11:15 - 11:20)
the back of your hand so slide it around (11:18 - 11:24)
and then slide it through your fingers (11:20 - 11:24)
gonna be good I just said I had a fix (11:26 - 11:32)
there are the buttons on the top right (11:30 - 11:34)
they couldn't put the wrist strap Loop (11:32 - 11:36)
there the button the button is on the (11:34 - 11:37)
top the button is by the wrist strap (11:36 - 11:41)
loot oh okay yeah why do they what are (11:37 - 11:43)
they doing also I'm not sure exactly (11:41 - 11:44)
what the top button does it's there for (11:43 - 11:47)
pairing initially so it's really easy to (11:44 - 11:49)
pair um you do have to unpair your (11:47 - 11:52)
current Pokeball Plus or your Pokemon go (11:49 - 11:55)
plus so you have to unpair that first to (11:52 - 11:56)
get this to work you press the button (11:55 - 11:59)
and then it sees it and then to confirm (11:56 - 12:00)
it you press both buttons and then it's (11:59 - 12:02)
good (12:00 - 12:04)
um I've seen some people talk about this (12:02 - 12:06)
on social media and I didn't have the (12:04 - 12:07)
problem yesterday I had that problem (12:06 - 12:09)
today though the problem is like (12:07 - 12:12)
sometimes it just doesn't work and what (12:09 - 12:14)
I mean by that is like yesterday (12:12 - 12:17)
you can okay let's back up here let me (12:14 - 12:21)
explain what it does for 55 dollars (12:17 - 12:25)
uh so it can do pokeballs great balls (12:21 - 12:26)
and Ultra Balls that's like new that's (12:25 - 12:28)
what people were super excited about (12:26 - 12:29)
that's what I was excited about it also (12:28 - 12:31)
spin stops which is what the Pokeball (12:29 - 12:34)
did if you had a Pokemon in it you can't (12:31 - 12:35)
put a Pokemon in here so that's fine (12:34 - 12:37)
whatever (12:35 - 12:38)
um but it will (12:37 - 12:41)
automatically still spin stops and it (12:38 - 12:44)
will automatically catch Pokemon without (12:41 - 12:47)
you pressing the button but only four (12:44 - 12:50)
pokeballs if you want to catch Pokemon (12:47 - 12:52)
using your great balls and your Ultra (12:50 - 12:54)
Balls you can but you have to press the (12:52 - 12:56)
button every time which is like whatever (12:54 - 13:00)
fine so yesterday when I was streaming (12:56 - 13:02)
with it (13:00 - 13:05)
um I did the like just Pokeballs (13:02 - 13:08)
just do it for me and it did and it (13:05 - 13:09)
worked great and it worked while I was (13:08 - 13:11)
driving I had in my pocket while I was (13:09 - 13:13)
driving and like every five seconds it (13:11 - 13:14)
was like (13:13 - 13:17)
and then like you got to like a stop (13:14 - 13:19)
light and then it goes crazy because (13:17 - 13:20)
like you're actually stopped so it's (13:19 - 13:23)
like non-stop so like it's it's working (13:20 - 13:25)
while I'm driving it's working while I'm (13:23 - 13:27)
walking I did like a two hour stream (13:25 - 13:29)
yesterday it worked today at Mall of (13:27 - 13:32)
America it didn't work at all I had it (13:29 - 13:34)
on I had the same settings like only (13:32 - 13:37)
like use the pokeballs Auto catch it (13:34 - 13:39)
wouldn't do anything without me pressing (13:37 - 13:41)
the button I tried to repair it (13:39 - 13:43)
disconnected I tried to force quit the (13:41 - 13:46)
app but even to spin a pokestop it (13:43 - 13:48)
wanted me to hit the button (13:46 - 13:50)
interesting for two hours I couldn't fix (13:48 - 13:52)
it I just I just kept hitting the button (13:50 - 13:54)
because I was like well I'm here yeah it (13:52 - 13:56)
feels like it's defaulting to the (13:54 - 13:58)
original go plus settings correct yeah (13:56 - 13:59)
so I tried the disconnected I tried to (13:58 - 14:00)
restart the app I try to do everything (13:59 - 14:02)
but that's what I saw people talk about (14:00 - 14:04)
yesterday and I was like oh that's crazy (14:02 - 14:06)
it worked perfectly for me and then all (14:04 - 14:08)
of a sudden like nope and now I'm having (14:06 - 14:09)
the problem that everyone else is having (14:08 - 14:12)
which is also it just buzzes really loud (14:09 - 14:14)
I heard it Buzz is really really loud I (14:12 - 14:17)
heard it's a loud buzzer (14:14 - 14:20)
so um (14:17 - 14:23)
you know like the throughout our journey (14:20 - 14:25)
of the Pokeball plus and the Pokemon go (14:23 - 14:27)
plus there have been times where it (14:25 - 14:29)
hasn't worked and there has to be (14:27 - 14:32)
updates it's a relatively new product I (14:29 - 14:34)
mean it it does work it doesn't work (14:32 - 14:37)
maybe 100 of the time but it it does (14:34 - 14:39)
work I do think it is the best of the (14:37 - 14:40)
three though (14:39 - 14:43)
design wise Comfort wise I have heard (14:40 - 14:46)
that it is about one second slower with (14:43 - 14:48)
each thing with catching Pokemon with (14:46 - 14:49)
spinning stops I've heard that it's (14:48 - 14:51)
about one second slower than the (14:49 - 14:53)
Pokeball plus and so if you're using it (14:51 - 14:55)
for a very long period of time that can (14:53 - 14:58)
stack up I feel like it's faster (14:55 - 15:02)
I feel like yesterday I was like was it (14:58 - 15:04)
faster when it worked yes when it when (15:02 - 15:07)
it worked yesterday it felt super fast (15:04 - 15:09)
but did it feel that way we had to press (15:07 - 15:11)
the button no you today it did not feel (15:09 - 15:13)
that way (15:11 - 15:13)
if I could review this off of (15:14 - 15:19)
yesterday's experience I would be like a (15:16 - 15:21)
hundred percent worth the 55 this is a (15:19 - 15:23)
really common question and I actually (15:21 - 15:24)
want to answer it before I forget people (15:23 - 15:27)
are like I'm not hardcore enough should (15:24 - 15:30)
I buy this I actually think it fits both (15:27 - 15:32)
markets yeah if you're hardcore I think (15:30 - 15:34)
it's of course because you look you're (15:32 - 15:36)
addicted to Pokemon go you love it you (15:34 - 15:37)
know you breathe it you sleep with it (15:36 - 15:39)
well if you're ready yeah technically (15:37 - 15:40)
you can't sleep with this technically (15:39 - 15:43)
yes you can so yes I think if you're (15:40 - 15:44)
hardcore you should buy it if you're (15:43 - 15:47)
casual I still 100 think it's worth it (15:44 - 15:48)
because I've I've played with so many (15:47 - 15:50)
casual people who only do Community Day (15:48 - 15:52)
for like an hour but then they're still (15:50 - 15:54)
there for the other two hours and I (15:52 - 15:56)
think it's just so great to like turn (15:54 - 15:59)
this on and put it in your pocket and go (15:56 - 16:02)
about your day like even when I was (15:59 - 16:04)
streaming yesterday it was it's really (16:02 - 16:06)
well that's because I'm like I'm like (16:04 - 16:08)
I'm like streaming with a camera and I'm (16:06 - 16:09)
like trying to walk and I'm trying to (16:08 - 16:11)
talk to people like even in that (16:09 - 16:13)
situation it's just nice to be like okay (16:11 - 16:15)
it's working it's catching you guys can (16:13 - 16:17)
see it catching but I can like watch (16:15 - 16:18)
where I'm going and I can explain what (16:17 - 16:21)
we're looking at and it's I think it's (16:18 - 16:23)
great for casual people too like I 100 (16:21 - 16:26)
think it's worth it I mean I liked my (16:23 - 16:27)
one because when I get tired of (16:26 - 16:29)
community today I was just like I'm (16:27 - 16:31)
going on easy mode I'm tired of checking (16:29 - 16:32)
these things I'm just gonna catch for a (16:31 - 16:34)
while because I'm done I'm done holding (16:32 - 16:36)
my phone I'm looking at my phone I'm (16:34 - 16:40)
done I just want to like have an hour of (16:36 - 16:43)
me just existing in the world and (16:40 - 16:45)
occasionally pushing a button it's (16:43 - 16:47)
honestly one of my favorite ways to play (16:45 - 16:49)
Pokemon go which sounds silly but I love (16:47 - 16:51)
going on long walks and just having an (16:49 - 16:53)
audiobook or a podcast or something (16:51 - 16:56)
playing in headphones and not having to (16:53 - 16:57)
focus on the thing in my hand while my (16:56 - 17:00)
ears are also occupied I like being able (16:57 - 17:02)
to just be pressing the button or in (17:00 - 17:03)
this case I would be able to have it (17:02 - 17:05)
automatically just be catching Pokemon (17:03 - 17:07)
as I'm listening to my thing and walking (17:05 - 17:09)
around and enjoying the walk it's a (17:07 - 17:11)
great time and you can catch a bunch of (17:09 - 17:13)
Pokemon and even potentially shinies and (17:11 - 17:16)
I saw one person uh caught a legendary (17:13 - 17:19)
glarion bird with it recently I saw her (17:16 - 17:22)
post yeah it's that for Ultra Ball or uh (17:19 - 17:23)
nope normal Pokeball (17:22 - 17:27)
serious it's a chance (17:23 - 17:27)
um the other thing is you can sleep with (17:27 - 17:35)
it without Pokemon go uh and online it's (17:30 - 17:38)
like really hard to understand the (17:35 - 17:40)
verbiage they use especially since it's (17:38 - 17:43)
advertised for Pokemon sleep but (17:40 - 17:46)
I did it last night it worked (17:43 - 17:49)
um so you the the when you first pair it (17:46 - 17:51)
it will ask you what your like reward (17:49 - 17:54)
time is or like the time that you (17:51 - 17:55)
normally check Pokemon go in the morning (17:54 - 17:57)
so I said like 11 A.M that's normally (17:55 - 18:01)
when I wake up and so when you go to bed (17:57 - 18:03)
you're supposed to hold the button (18:01 - 18:07)
actually let me see if I can do it here (18:03 - 18:07)
it's not gonna work is it (18:08 - 18:12)
you should (18:09 - 18:12)
I mean it lit up for half a second there (18:12 - 18:17)
we go (18:14 - 18:17)
I don't know if you guys can hear (18:18 - 18:22)
Pikachu sort of hear Pikachu singing so (18:19 - 18:24)
you hold it and then he starts singing a (18:22 - 18:26)
lullaby which is really long by the way (18:24 - 18:28)
I don't know if there's a way to stop (18:26 - 18:30)
him from singing this lullaby (18:28 - 18:32)
you can press the button once is what (18:30 - 18:33)
I've heard you have to manually press (18:32 - 18:35)
the button to stop all the Pikachu from (18:33 - 18:37)
singing so I thought that would cancel (18:35 - 18:39)
no you have to hold it down again to (18:37 - 18:42)
have it cancel okay so after he's he's (18:39 - 18:46)
still doing his little buy here (18:42 - 18:46)
he keep going (18:47 - 18:52)
okay he's he's done so now now this is (18:49 - 18:54)
in sleep mode (18:52 - 18:58)
Justice devices and you need to still (18:54 - 19:01)
have at least a 90 minute nap for this (18:58 - 19:02)
to count (19:01 - 19:04)
but when you when you're done sleeping (19:02 - 19:06)
you hold the button again and he goes (19:04 - 19:08)
pika pika because he's awake and then (19:06 - 19:09)
when it gets to your reward time so like (19:08 - 19:12)
I woke up at 9am this morning so if you (19:09 - 19:15)
want pika pika and then at 11 I got my (19:12 - 19:18)
rewards which was one sticker (19:15 - 19:19)
um (19:18 - 19:22)
1700 Stardust and then like something (19:19 - 19:24)
else buddy (19:22 - 19:27)
oh yeah yep (19:24 - 19:29)
and there was a little trumbeak falling (19:27 - 19:30)
in the sky and then it was like you (19:29 - 19:32)
slept for five hours (19:30 - 19:34)
I don't know if the birds in the sky (19:32 - 19:36)
change (19:34 - 19:40)
but that but that uh from my (19:36 - 19:42)
understanding has nothing to do with (19:40 - 19:46)
sleep so like when sleep comes out I (19:42 - 19:47)
like I'm not going to be able to like (19:46 - 19:50)
backtrack my history of sleep from my (19:47 - 19:51)
understanding and that's I think what (19:50 - 19:54)
they told me in New York when I went (19:51 - 19:56)
um this that is just a way (19:54 - 20:00)
for you to get those rewards in Pokemon (19:56 - 20:02)
go (20:00 - 20:05)
so I don't know fully I guess we'll (20:02 - 20:08)
probably know probably in the next 24 to (20:05 - 20:09)
48 hours (20:08 - 20:12)
if that's how it fully works with sleep (20:09 - 20:14)
or if I just go into sleep and I say (20:12 - 20:16)
like hey I'm going to sleep (20:14 - 20:18)
do I have to still hold this button down (20:16 - 20:21)
and listen to the lullaby and I I don't (20:18 - 20:23)
know it is cool that it works in like (20:21 - 20:25)
1700 Stardust for like kind of doing (20:23 - 20:28)
nothing is is pretty awesome (20:25 - 20:29)
um (20:28 - 20:31)
and if you're going for that uh get a (20:29 - 20:33)
heart with your buddy for 20 days in a (20:31 - 20:35)
row still this makes it a little easier (20:33 - 20:38)
potentially yeah (20:35 - 20:41)
but I am confused about how both (20:38 - 20:45)
featured it is with the Pokemon with the (20:41 - 20:47)
Sleep aspect in Pokemon go and I sure (20:45 - 20:48)
hope you don't have to log your sleep (20:47 - 20:51)
separately in Pokemon go and Pokemon (20:48 - 20:53)
sleep once the actual Pokemon sleep app (20:51 - 20:54)
is out (20:53 - 20:57)
yeah that's my worry too is I don't want (20:54 - 20:59)
to log it twice yeah (20:57 - 21:03)
so if it works as is like if I just have (20:59 - 21:05)
to you know go to sleep in the sleep app (21:03 - 21:07)
and then it works with go sleep (21:05 - 21:09)
seamlessly that's awesome obviously (21:07 - 21:11)
right now I don't have sleep I just have (21:09 - 21:14)
go so it's fine if I'd have to log it (21:11 - 21:16)
twice I feel like I'd default to just (21:14 - 21:19)
using go and and let the sleep app alone (21:16 - 21:21)
just not use it (21:19 - 21:27)
for it Hannah are you excited to pay ten (21:21 - 21:30)
dollars a month to play Pokemon sleep (21:27 - 21:34)
yes or no no nope I'm not even gonna do (21:30 - 21:37)
that absolutely not I thought I might (21:34 - 21:39)
try but I already paid for a different (21:37 - 21:42)
sleep app so I I'm not adding another (21:39 - 21:44)
ten dollars a month for sleep tracking (21:42 - 21:47)
how much is that other sleep app uh six (21:44 - 21:48)
dollars a month (21:47 - 21:49)
yeah (21:48 - 21:53)
yeah so 60 bucks a year (21:49 - 21:56)
there are not well I'm assuming there's (21:53 - 21:58)
a discount if you do a year that would (21:56 - 22:00)
be my guess (21:58 - 22:02)
I've just decided I'm just automatically (22:00 - 22:05)
thinking there's a discount (22:02 - 22:09)
so yeah I you know I I full disclosure (22:05 - 22:10)
maybe you've already seen my YouTube (22:09 - 22:13)
video and Pokemon invited me out to New (22:10 - 22:15)
York they paid for my hotel and they (22:13 - 22:17)
paid for my flight they did not pay for (22:15 - 22:21)
my 80 Uber ride from my hotel to JFK (22:17 - 22:22)
that was on me (22:21 - 22:27)
ouch uh Welcome to New York they did not (22:22 - 22:29)
pay for my 80 Uber ride (22:27 - 22:31)
um that was fine though we are the only (22:29 - 22:33)
I'm I'm told I took the subway initially (22:31 - 22:35)
in which was cool but we had (22:33 - 22:38)
so much stuff to take back I just didn't (22:35 - 22:39)
want to bring it on the subway and we (22:38 - 22:41)
were already really short on time (22:39 - 22:43)
um which like (22:41 - 22:44)
would have been fine on the subway (22:43 - 22:46)
unless we like missed or like took you (22:44 - 22:47)
know I just didn't want to be late (22:46 - 22:49)
anyways (22:47 - 22:51)
um (22:49 - 22:54)
I the second they said pricing I thought (22:51 - 22:55)
to myself (22:54 - 22:57)
this is the thing people are going to be (22:55 - 22:59)
upset about (22:57 - 23:01)
uh even if they've never played it (22:59 - 23:03)
they're going to be upset uh (23:01 - 23:05)
yeah (23:03 - 23:06)
I don't know if you guys have any (23:05 - 23:08)
questions for me in regards to that but (23:06 - 23:10)
I did look up the number one sleep app (23:08 - 23:15)
in the Apple App Store is 50 a year (23:10 - 23:18)
which is very different than a hundred (23:15 - 23:19)
dollars a year which is what Pokemon (23:18 - 23:21)
sleep would cost you if you did a full (23:19 - 23:23)
year and the number two sleep app in the (23:21 - 23:26)
Apple App Store was 70 a year so again (23:23 - 23:30)
not even well 70 is closer to 100 but (23:26 - 23:33)
I'm just gonna go on a whim and guess (23:30 - 23:35)
that the actual sleep apps that are (23:33 - 23:37)
number one and number two are probably (23:35 - 23:39)
better sleep apps than Pokemon sleep (23:37 - 23:43)
will be uh but also uh I don't think (23:39 - 23:46)
they have a game so maybe the game (23:43 - 23:49)
aspect is what sets Pokemon sleep apart (23:46 - 23:51)
I think if if it's the same as when I (23:49 - 23:53)
last looked into it the two best sleep (23:51 - 23:55)
trackers that you can have for your (23:53 - 23:57)
phone are gonna be the ones with (23:55 - 23:59)
external devices that track things like (23:57 - 24:00)
your heart rate so that's going to be (23:59 - 24:03)
the sleep on the Apple watch and that's (24:00 - 24:05)
going to be the sleep that's attached to (24:03 - 24:06)
this little (24:05 - 24:08)
ring that I have since I have one of (24:06 - 24:10)
those sleep rings and so you actually (24:08 - 24:11)
have to have the physical device that (24:10 - 24:13)
tracks your body and those are going to (24:11 - 24:15)
be the most accurate ones and anything (24:13 - 24:17)
else is going to use the same sorts of (24:15 - 24:19)
stats that Pokemon sleep does so it's (24:17 - 24:21)
going to be roughly roughly the same (24:19 - 24:24)
inaccuracy (24:21 - 24:24)
Greg you paying the ten dollars right (24:24 - 24:30)
that's too much money what would you pay (24:26 - 24:33)
what would you pay well I wouldn't (24:30 - 24:37)
like I (24:33 - 24:40)
the game inside would have to be so (24:37 - 24:43)
amazing because I don't pay for any (24:40 - 24:44)
mobile game (24:43 - 24:48)
period I don't like I play Masters every (24:44 - 24:49)
day and I think I've given them money (24:48 - 24:51)
once and I gave him 20 bucks I'm like (24:49 - 24:54)
yeah this game is worth twenty dollars (24:51 - 24:55)
I'm out (24:54 - 24:57)
you haven't even I think you only gave (24:55 - 24:58)
unite twenty dollars too I've only (24:57 - 24:59)
giving you night twenty dollars too (24:58 - 25:02)
thanks I'm out (24:59 - 25:03)
um (25:02 - 25:05)
because (25:03 - 25:05)
I generally don't feel that there is (25:07 - 25:13)
enough there for me to pay more money (25:10 - 25:16)
for that like I don't have huge I I'm (25:13 - 25:17)
not worried about my sleep I'm not (25:16 - 25:19)
worried about my Sleep Quality I'm not (25:17 - 25:22)
worried about tracking my sleep I'm none (25:19 - 25:25)
of that is a part of my day-to-day life (25:22 - 25:28)
I attract my sleep (25:25 - 25:31)
for like six months with a device that (25:28 - 25:32)
my husband kick-started during his (25:31 - 25:35)
massive kickstarting phase and I was (25:32 - 25:37)
like yep I slept the time that I was (25:35 - 25:40)
asleep (25:37 - 25:40)
yep I knew that already and you're (25:40 - 25:45)
taking a guess at how restful that was I (25:42 - 25:47)
feel fine and I don't feel exhausted and (25:45 - 25:50)
I never really feel exhausted (25:47 - 25:52)
um so (25:50 - 25:56)
that type of game either has to (25:52 - 25:58)
be better than the things that I am (25:56 - 26:00)
paying roughly a hundred dollars a month (25:58 - 26:05)
for which is generally Final Fantasy 14. (26:00 - 26:07)
or (26:05 - 26:09)
a main Series game which would pay sixty (26:07 - 26:12)
dollars once and then the DLC is 30 and (26:09 - 26:16)
I need that level of gameplay or (26:12 - 26:18)
I'm out I also don't know what you're (26:16 - 26:20)
doing with my data (26:18 - 26:23)
okay I asked that specific question I (26:20 - 26:25)
was the one that asked that (26:23 - 26:28)
I because they had the they had the the (26:25 - 26:31)
game director I think was there they (26:28 - 26:34)
they zoomed him in from Japan so uh it (26:31 - 26:36)
was like 8 A.M his time you can tell (26:34 - 26:37)
that he was probably gonna use Pokemon (26:36 - 26:39)
sleep after our meeting (26:37 - 26:44)
um but uh I did ask like hey you know (26:39 - 26:46)
people are already upset about like (26:44 - 26:48)
location data in Pokemon go and how (26:46 - 26:51)
that's being used obviously your your (26:48 - 26:53)
sleep is related to health and health is (26:51 - 26:54)
really personal what are you guys doing (26:53 - 26:56)
with our health data or what would you (26:54 - 26:59)
tell somebody who's concerned about your (26:56 - 27:01)
health data and they said that Pokemon (26:59 - 27:07)
sleep will not share any sleep data or (27:01 - 27:09)
sell share or sell with any third (27:07 - 27:13)
parties and the data will be uploaded (27:09 - 27:17)
anonymously to Pokemon sleep and if you (27:13 - 27:19)
look at the current Pokemon privacy (27:17 - 27:22)
policy for your country they're not (27:19 - 27:24)
changing it for sleep (27:22 - 27:25)
now that's going to be different than (27:24 - 27:28)
niantic's policy private privacy policy (27:25 - 27:31)
but they said that they're following the (27:28 - 27:32)
current Pokemon (27:31 - 27:36)
privacy policy for this game uh and then (27:32 - 27:40)
you can upload or it does record your (27:36 - 27:42)
your noises like if you're snoring and (27:40 - 27:43)
stuff (27:42 - 27:45)
um that doesn't get shared with anyone (27:43 - 27:47)
uh they don't actually do anything with (27:45 - 27:49)
that data and that the Sleep the (27:47 - 27:52)
sleeping noises that you make are for (27:49 - 27:54)
you and only you to listen back to and (27:52 - 27:57)
they will expire after 24 hours (27:54 - 27:58)
so they're not doing anything with your (27:57 - 28:01)
snoring data they don't even look at (27:58 - 28:02)
your snoring data they don't get to hear (28:01 - 28:04)
what you say in your sleep yeah yeah (28:02 - 28:06)
yeah (28:04 - 28:06)
so I don't know if that makes anyone (28:06 - 28:10)
feel any better I mean um I will cover (28:08 - 28:12)
it very quickly I'm on their privacy (28:10 - 28:15)
policy uh they will use it for business (28:12 - 28:18)

um (28:27 - 28:31)
they say they did not share the personal (28:29 - 28:33)
admission with third party other than as (28:31 - 28:36)
follows uh if you consent to it (28:33 - 28:37)
uh (28:36 - 28:39)
for third-party vendors that need that (28:37 - 28:41)
personal information that do the work (28:39 - 28:44)
for business purposes uh (28:41 - 28:48)

blah (28:53 - 28:58)
so unlike niantics which does say (28:54 - 29:02)
you know anonymized stuff goes somewhere (28:58 - 29:06)
uh which is their loophole uh they don't (29:02 - 29:10)
show any anything like Anonymous stuff (29:06 - 29:13)
is sent outside of their company so at (29:10 - 29:16)
least on their current privacy page they (29:13 - 29:18)
don't do anything with the anonymous (29:16 - 29:19)
aggregate (29:18 - 29:21)
stuff at least what they have listed in (29:19 - 29:24)
their privacy policy yeah and they they (29:21 - 29:27)
I mean he answered me directly and (29:24 - 29:28)
that's what he said he said current (29:27 - 29:30)
privacy policy will not will be the same (29:28 - 29:32)
for Pokemon sleep but he did say like (29:30 - 29:34)
hey our privacy policies (29:32 - 29:36)
probably slightly different in Japan (29:34 - 29:37)
than it is in the United States than it (29:36 - 29:40)
is in you know Nigeria that is is (29:37 - 29:41)
Germany (29:40 - 29:42)
um (29:41 - 29:44)
so (29:42 - 29:47)
you know I (29:44 - 29:47)
I posted the my like little Instagram (29:47 - 29:53)
short of like here's here's everything (29:50 - 29:54)
that the premium ten dollars gets you (29:53 - 29:56)
and of course some of the comments were (29:54 - 29:58)
like they're charging us money and (29:56 - 30:00)
selling our data it's like well it (29:58 - 30:01)
doesn't matter what I say you know (30:00 - 30:03)
people are gonna believe yeah so that's (30:01 - 30:05)
up to you listener I'm not trying I'm (30:03 - 30:07)
not here to convince you I'm just (30:05 - 30:08)
telling you what the game director told (30:07 - 30:10)
me I asked that question and if it makes (30:08 - 30:13)
you feel good cool if it doesn't look I (30:10 - 30:16)
get it as well like I'm not here to (30:13 - 30:19)
convince you so is the game playable at (30:16 - 30:21)
all without paying the ten dollars yes (30:19 - 30:23)
yeah yeah yeah it is (30:21 - 30:24)
um (30:23 - 30:26)
you are you're not paying to win because (30:24 - 30:28)
I I don't know what you're really (30:26 - 30:32)
winning you're winning sleep (30:28 - 30:34)
um you it I I said this multiple times (30:32 - 30:36)
in my YouTube video which is like 50 (30:34 - 30:38)
minutes I answer a bunch of questions (30:36 - 30:41)
um I will say it here it is it is paying (30:38 - 30:43)
to speed things up and that's pretty (30:41 - 30:45)
much it which I don't really get I feel (30:43 - 30:47)
like I want to be able to use this for (30:45 - 30:50)
as long as possible (30:47 - 30:50)
um (30:50 - 30:55)
yeah I mean like I think part of me this (30:51 - 30:57)
is just me personally I think part of me (30:55 - 31:00)
is when I I do pay for a game I feel (30:57 - 31:01)
like (31:00 - 31:03)
there's like a sunk cost fallacy at that (31:01 - 31:05)
point where I feel like I'm obligated to (31:03 - 31:07)
play it even more because I paid but (31:05 - 31:09)
like (31:07 - 31:12)
I don't know if the value is there like (31:09 - 31:14)
when Greg said I pay 60 for a main (31:12 - 31:15)
Series game and I think well this is a (31:14 - 31:17)
hundred dollars and I don't think that (31:15 - 31:19)
that's gonna I don't think this is gonna (31:17 - 31:21)
have more content than scarlet and (31:19 - 31:22)
violet (31:21 - 31:24)
um I will say though I was (31:22 - 31:26)
there was way more content than I (31:24 - 31:28)
thought there's so many items you can (31:26 - 31:31)
pick up it's an actual game there's a (31:28 - 31:32)
hundred Pokemon at the start I think (31:31 - 31:34)
they said that there's supposed to be (31:32 - 31:37)
400 Pokemon eventually it is Gen 1 (31:34 - 31:39)
through gen 9. (31:37 - 31:41)
um you know I already saw Jen like like (31:39 - 31:44)
I got a gen 3 I got Gulpin it was when I (31:41 - 31:45)
woke up (31:44 - 31:46)
um (31:45 - 31:48)
there there is Inventory management (31:46 - 31:50)
there's Pokemon storage obviously you (31:48 - 31:52)
can collect Pokemon (31:50 - 31:55)
Inventory management I am a hardcore out (31:52 - 31:58)
I am so out you're you're it's it is (31:55 - 32:00)
like Pokemon go where your bag has a (31:58 - 32:02)
storage limit your Pokemon storage has a (32:00 - 32:05)
limit and then something else has a (32:02 - 32:06)
limit (32:05 - 32:07)
which (32:06 - 32:08)
but but (32:07 - 32:12)
similar to Magikarp jump I only gave (32:08 - 32:14)
Magikarp jump I think like five dollars (32:12 - 32:15)
or something I think Magikarp jump had (32:14 - 32:18)
like a welcome package or whatever for (32:15 - 32:20)
five bucks and I did that (32:18 - 32:23)
uh Magikarp jump was so playable without (32:20 - 32:25)
giving it money and it feels like this (32:23 - 32:27)
game is really really playable without (32:25 - 32:29)
giving it money (32:27 - 32:32)
um so that's it's just (32:29 - 32:32)
I I'm worried that me personally would (32:33 - 32:38)
have the Animal Crossing effect which is (32:35 - 32:40)
I'm going to play it every day and this (32:38 - 32:43)
the day I miss one day is going to (32:40 - 32:46)
Domino into missing more days into then (32:43 - 32:47)
just not playing because I feel like I'm (32:46 - 32:50)
so far behind which is a which I don't (32:47 - 32:52)
know any other game that has that I (32:50 - 32:53)
don't know if I've coined that word the (32:52 - 32:54)
Animal Crossing effect I think everyone (32:53 - 32:56)
knows what I'm talking about don't say (32:54 - 32:57)
that (32:56 - 33:00)
I'm not sure what you can get behind on (32:57 - 33:01)
though (33:00 - 33:03)
it's not quite the same as Animal (33:01 - 33:05)
Crossing so yeah the game director said (33:03 - 33:06)
that like (33:05 - 33:09)
individual sleep sessions are not that (33:06 - 33:12)
important so if if you have a dog or a (33:09 - 33:13)
cat or you have a significant other in (33:12 - 33:16)
your bed you shouldn't stress out or be (33:13 - 33:17)
worried that that like might mess up (33:16 - 33:20)
your day he's he said what is more (33:17 - 33:22)
important is like going to bed at the (33:20 - 33:26)
same time and then doing it every day so (33:22 - 33:28)
you will get like a daily (33:26 - 33:30)
um check-in every morning when you check (33:28 - 33:32)
in with Snorlax but then you'll get a (33:30 - 33:34)
weekly one and the weekly one is the (33:32 - 33:36)
thing that like you really want (33:34 - 33:38)
um and that's going to reward you for (33:36 - 33:40)
like all week so that's that's why I do (33:38 - 33:41)
go back to like the Animal Crossing (33:40 - 33:44)
effect because like if you're on day (33:41 - 33:45)
five and then you miss day six you're (33:44 - 33:46)
just like (33:45 - 33:50)
I I ruined my week like I missed it (33:46 - 33:51)
so (33:50 - 33:53)
but again I've only I only played the (33:51 - 33:57)
game for you know I only slept once (33:53 - 33:59)
and I was still in like hardcore (33:57 - 34:01)
tutorial mode because they they make you (33:59 - 34:03)
catch a starter at least everyone in my (34:01 - 34:05)
party they like every everyone either (34:03 - 34:08)
like I got like two monkeys a Caterpie a (34:05 - 34:10)
Bulbasaur and like uh Gulpin and it made (34:08 - 34:12)
me catch the Bulbasaur and then everyone (34:10 - 34:13)
else was like yeah made me catch (34:12 - 34:15)
Charmander it made me catch Squirtle so (34:13 - 34:17)
your first day is kind of (34:15 - 34:18)
um (34:17 - 34:21)
predetermined of like you'll get one of (34:18 - 34:23)
the three starters and that what will be (34:21 - 34:25)
the first catch but on the second day (34:23 - 34:27)
ideally if I got two main keys I should (34:25 - 34:30)
be able to catch one if I have (34:27 - 34:33)
biscuits or pokeballs to like comble (34:30 - 34:36)
them down and all that stuff (34:33 - 34:36)
um (34:37 - 34:40)
the other thing is like shinies are in (34:38 - 34:43)
the game uh which we found out from a (34:40 - 34:46)
data mine and somebody at the event (34:43 - 34:48)
asked the director like Hey how do we (34:46 - 34:51)
shiny hunt in this game and the the sigh (34:48 - 34:54)
of disappointment he did in front of us (34:51 - 34:57)
was both amazing (34:54 - 34:59)
and funny at the same time like I like (34:57 - 35:03)
it wasn't like surprising to me but he (34:59 - 35:04)
was just like (35:03 - 35:06)
we haven't talked about Chinese I'm not (35:04 - 35:07)
going to confirm or deny if they're (35:06 - 35:10)
Chinese but if there is shinies we want (35:07 - 35:14)
our trainers to like find that out and (35:10 - 35:16)
have that be fun for them to discover (35:14 - 35:19)
instead of just giving you how to do it (35:16 - 35:21)
yeah (35:19 - 35:23)
I don't know if there there is near your (35:21 - 35:26)
little tent you can put down like two (35:23 - 35:30)
incense I got one incense for free like (35:26 - 35:31)
just like Pokemon go (35:30 - 35:33)
um and then the incense is supposed to (35:31 - 35:35)
like when you go to sleep attract more (35:33 - 35:38)
Pokemon and obviously you can buy more (35:35 - 35:39)
incense I don't know I'm sure you could (35:38 - 35:41)
pay real money for them but you can use (35:39 - 35:43)
the in-game currency to also buy them (35:41 - 35:45)
I don't know if there is a shiny hunting (35:43 - 35:49)
method but I don't know how method (35:45 - 35:52)
hunting a game that requires you to go (35:49 - 35:56)
to sleep would be like this is my ideal (35:52 - 36:00)
shiny hunting method I was born for this (35:56 - 36:02)
I could sleep anywhere at any time let's (36:00 - 36:06)
shiny hat for seven hours good night (36:02 - 36:07)
yeah I don't know if it's like if you (36:06 - 36:10)
sleep longer you'll you'll increase the (36:07 - 36:12)
chance because if it is you just sleep (36:10 - 36:13)
longer increase the chance then people (36:12 - 36:15)
are just gonna like not tell their phone (36:13 - 36:17)
they woke up until like the maximum (36:15 - 36:19)
thing right now they're just gonna go (36:17 - 36:22)
into medical induced Comas right like (36:19 - 36:24)
you you can take one nap during the day (36:22 - 36:26)
but it has to be 60 minutes but if (36:24 - 36:28)
people want to gamify this or like I (36:26 - 36:30)
don't know cheat I don't know why they (36:28 - 36:31)
wouldn't be cheating it would just be (36:30 - 36:33)
like just say you're napping for nine (36:31 - 36:35)
hours and then just after nine hours (36:33 - 36:37)
just hate that you woke up and then just (36:35 - 36:39)
go back to sleep for another nine hours (36:37 - 36:43)
like you can you can like (36:39 - 36:45)
I not she I don't know what to call it (36:43 - 36:45)
like (36:45 - 36:48)
you can game the game yeah you can game (36:45 - 36:50)
the game I guess if you really want to (36:48 - 36:52)
but what are you gonna I don't know it's (36:50 - 36:54)
My worry is like (36:52 - 36:57)
I want to use it as is (36:54 - 37:00)
because I don't want to stress out about (36:57 - 37:02)
like I don't want to stress out about (37:00 - 37:04)
everything else because at that point (37:02 - 37:05)
I'm just gonna check out of the game (37:04 - 37:07)
like I don't I wanted to is this post (37:05 - 37:09)
it's supposed to be a game so I want to (37:07 - 37:12)
have fun and the second I start thinking (37:09 - 37:15)
like oh I'm behind or oh my gosh Greg (37:12 - 37:19)
has 30 Pokemon in his Pokedex and I only (37:15 - 37:21)
have 28. I even better sleep an extra (37:19 - 37:24)
two hours tonight like it just it's just (37:21 - 37:26)
really silly to think about (37:24 - 37:28)
also they said the ideal sleep was eight (37:26 - 37:30)
and a half hours (37:28 - 37:32)
that seems really long (37:30 - 37:35)
um I thought let's I thought seven to (37:32 - 37:37)
eight was like the state let's walk away (37:35 - 37:40)
from what ideal is because it is highly (37:37 - 37:42)
individual yep on (37:40 - 37:46)
average and we are talking on average (37:42 - 37:49)
when you take literally a billion people (37:46 - 37:52)
and average it out it's between seven to (37:49 - 37:54)
eight hours is (37:52 - 37:56)
the sleep (37:54 - 37:59)
resting area there are people who are (37:56 - 38:00)
completely arrested at five there are (37:59 - 38:02)
people who are not rested unless they (38:00 - 38:05)
slept 10. like it is on average it is (38:02 - 38:09)
like most things involving your body (38:05 - 38:12)
highly personal the best way to figure (38:09 - 38:16)
out what your actual sleep duration is (38:12 - 38:20)
is to do a two-week vacation because the (38:16 - 38:22)
second week if you just allow yourself (38:20 - 38:25)
to sleep is when you will finally find (38:22 - 38:26)
out how long you're supposed to be (38:25 - 38:28)
sleeping (38:26 - 38:30)
yep I don't have any any qualms with any (38:28 - 38:32)
of those (38:30 - 38:34)
that it does vary over the course of (38:32 - 38:36)
your life time and it does generally (38:34 - 38:38)
it's a little bit younger as you're (38:36 - 38:40)
younger you generally need more sleep (38:38 - 38:42)
and as you get older you still need (38:40 - 38:44)
sleep but it becomes harder to sleep (38:42 - 38:48)
what also as you get older it you need a (38:44 - 38:50)
little bit less you sleep in shorter (38:48 - 38:54)
durations as well so okay you will sleep (38:50 - 38:56)
for five hours wake up sleep again (38:54 - 38:58)
that's why you have a lot of (38:56 - 39:00)
grandparents are like (38:58 - 39:03)
I went to bed at eight I got up at 1am I (39:00 - 39:06)
made Seven pies and then I went back to (39:03 - 39:08)
sleep because that is how did you know (39:06 - 39:10)
what I did last night I look I have (39:08 - 39:12)
cameras everywhere (39:10 - 39:14)
um but that that happens like when I say (39:12 - 39:16)
I've gotten to the age where I'm now (39:14 - 39:18)
waking up at four is because I'm getting (39:16 - 39:22)
to the age where I need less chunks of (39:18 - 39:23)
sleep (39:22 - 39:25)
uh before my body's like hey we need to (39:23 - 39:26)
take care of this thing and then we're (39:25 - 39:27)
gonna put you right back to sleep (39:26 - 39:29)
because I will get up use the restroom (39:27 - 39:31)
and then immediately go back to sleep (39:29 - 39:33)
but like my grandma would go to sleep at (39:31 - 39:34)
eight (39:33 - 39:37)
we would get messages from her at like (39:34 - 39:38)
two in the morning because she's (39:37 - 39:40)
wandering around making things and then (39:38 - 39:42)
we're like well we can't call her again (39:40 - 39:43)
because she went back to bed at three (39:42 - 39:45)
and she's not gonna wake up until 10. (39:43 - 39:47)
like (39:45 - 39:51)
your sleep varies wildly and also the (39:47 - 39:54)
amount of sleep you need your sleep (39:51 - 39:56)
cycle will also change so some people (39:54 - 39:59)
will have a sleep cycle of an hour some (39:56 - 40:01)
people will have a sleep cycle of an (39:59 - 40:02)
hour and a half so (40:01 - 40:05)
like if you take a nap you could be a 60 (40:02 - 40:07)
Minute Napper a 90 minute Napper it (40:05 - 40:08)
depends on when your cycle ends about (40:07 - 40:11)
how rested you will feel (40:08 - 40:14)
when you wake up and that is (40:11 - 40:17)
also highly individual which has to do (40:14 - 40:19)
with the varying alarm clock that I know (40:17 - 40:21)
you mentioned in your stream and video (40:19 - 40:25)
Steve that you can set a window for the (40:21 - 40:27)
alarm (40:25 - 40:29)
um no it's a toggle that you hit uh and (40:27 - 40:31)
I can't remember what it's called like (40:29 - 40:33)
smart smart wake up I think they called (40:31 - 40:37)
it yeah so you when you set your (40:33 - 40:43)
alarm which I set mine for I think 7 30. (40:37 - 40:46)
um there if it's from my understanding (40:43 - 40:48)
this is what it said in the app it said (40:46 - 40:50)
like if it senses you to like wake up a (40:48 - 40:52)
little bit before that it will then just (40:50 - 40:54)
trigger the alarm then (40:52 - 40:56)
so you don't go back into which I've (40:54 - 40:58)
heard from like other other studies of (40:56 - 40:59)
like (40:58 - 41:01)
if you're naturally waking up and then (40:59 - 41:03)
you like doze back it's like kind of (41:01 - 41:05)
harder to get up (41:03 - 41:07)
well because if you've dozed back and (41:05 - 41:08)
your alarm goes off in the middle of (41:07 - 41:10)
your next sleep cycle you are trying to (41:08 - 41:12)
get out of a very different type of (41:10 - 41:14)
sleep than when your natural rhythm is (41:12 - 41:16)
hit the time where your body is like (41:14 - 41:20)
should we wake up no so I think I'd (41:16 - 41:22)
catch it great I don't know if that (41:20 - 41:23)
worked for me in my instance because one (41:22 - 41:25)
I was in a hotel bed so I wasn't (41:23 - 41:29)
sleeping amazingly anyways two I had the (41:25 - 41:32)
fear of missing my morning meeting where (41:29 - 41:34)
I had to like give back my phone and (41:32 - 41:35)
then like go over my results with them (41:34 - 41:37)
so I I don't know if I I don't know if I (41:35 - 41:38)
would just woke up naturally or if it (41:37 - 41:41)
was like oh my gosh did I ever speak (41:38 - 41:45)
I I have had really good uh (41:41 - 41:47)
uses of that kind of feature in the past (41:45 - 41:50)
I used an app for maybe a few years back (41:47 - 41:52)
in middle school that did that where it (41:50 - 41:54)
woke me up when I started moving in the (41:52 - 41:57)
morning closest to my alarm and I (41:54 - 41:59)
definitely felt more rested with that (41:57 - 42:02)
alarm than with a set time that was just (41:59 - 42:05)
the same time every day so I'm looking (42:02 - 42:08)
forward to that feature (42:05 - 42:08)
yeah I uh I was impressed with the it (42:08 - 42:15)
seemed like there was a lot of game (42:14 - 42:17)
there (42:15 - 42:19)
um and they did kind of stress multiple (42:17 - 42:23)
times that it it's not a health app (42:19 - 42:25)
it's a game I think that's just because (42:23 - 42:28)
if they use the words Health app then (42:25 - 42:29)
they're liable for (42:28 - 42:32)
a lot (42:29 - 42:34)
so they did say that they worked with (42:32 - 42:36)
like this famous Japanese sleep (42:34 - 42:37)
Professor (42:36 - 42:41)
um and then like the translator girl (42:37 - 42:44)
who works for I think she works for (42:41 - 42:45)
select button (42:44 - 42:46)
um (42:45 - 42:48)
she was like he's like really well known (42:46 - 42:50)
in Japan and she gave his name and she (42:48 - 42:52)
gave what like College University (42:50 - 42:54)
whatever that he attended and she was (42:52 - 42:55)
like it was like really exciting that he (42:54 - 42:57)
was working on it because (42:55 - 42:59)
apparently he's a big deal in Japan but (42:57 - 43:02)
like that was (42:59 - 43:04)
he was like (43:02 - 43:07)
um not like the reference the the the (43:04 - 43:10)
person they would go to probably an (43:07 - 43:12)
advisor of something yeah advisor yeah (43:10 - 43:13)
yeah there we go yeah he was the advisor (43:12 - 43:15)
so (43:13 - 43:17)
um she seemed like genuinely excited and (43:15 - 43:18)
uh (43:17 - 43:20)
she was she was great she like did all (43:18 - 43:21)
the translations for the game director (43:20 - 43:23)
and for us and everything (43:21 - 43:24)
um (43:23 - 43:26)
yeah I and going back to like the game (43:24 - 43:28)
it's just like (43:26 - 43:31)
some people don't even nap so like are (43:28 - 43:33)
other people going to have an advantage (43:31 - 43:35)
in this non-competitive game because (43:33 - 43:37)
they do nap first people that don't nap (43:35 - 43:43)
like I do I I do worry the the social (43:37 - 43:43)
almost like stress around like I like I (43:43 - 43:49)
feel behind in this game because I'm not (43:48 - 43:51)
doing it properly or not doing it right (43:49 - 43:54)
for a game that is supposed to be like (43:51 - 43:57)
developing you healthy habits it does (43:54 - 44:00)
seem like a stressful game of like am I (43:57 - 44:02)
gonna get a shiny uh did I I didn't get (44:00 - 44:04)
any new Pokemon last night oh I maybe I (44:02 - 44:06)
didn't sleep long enough or like I don't (44:04 - 44:08)
take a nap but maybe I should like (44:06 - 44:11)
I just want to try to enjoy it (44:08 - 44:13)
I'm just gonna go at it as this is an (44:11 - 44:16)
extra button I press when I go to bed oh (44:13 - 44:17)
look there's Pokemon in the morning (44:16 - 44:20)
that's cool (44:17 - 44:23)
I'm gonna I'm gonna game the heck out of (44:20 - 44:25)
this thing I got my nap schedules (44:23 - 44:28)
planned I got my time for bed I got my (44:25 - 44:30)
time to rise all said I'm gonna blow you (44:28 - 44:33)
people away and I'm not gonna pay a (44:30 - 44:36)
dollar for it I do really like that it (44:33 - 44:38)
values consistency when you go to bed (44:36 - 44:40)
not only do I think that that's a good (44:38 - 44:42)
idea but I also know that it's one of (44:40 - 44:44)
the things I'm particularly bad at so (44:42 - 44:47)
I'm hoping this helps yeah I I think (44:44 - 44:49)
this game is like really ambitious I (44:47 - 44:50)
think it's really cool I don't know if (44:49 - 44:53)
this is gonna be like a 10 year you know (44:50 - 44:54)
what I mean I don't know this is gonna (44:53 - 44:55)
be another Pokemon go or a Pokemon (44:54 - 44:58)
Masters or I mean Magikarp jump is still (44:55 - 44:58)
out (44:58 - 45:02)
it still exists not everything has to be (44:58 - 45:05)
long lasting for it to have value also (45:02 - 45:06)
true (45:05 - 45:08)
I don't think it works I think this was (45:06 - 45:09)
asked I don't think it works with apple (45:08 - 45:11)
health kit or Google health kit (45:09 - 45:14)
um I think I would be more (45:11 - 45:17)
it like I would be almost more willing (45:14 - 45:19)
if I guess I guess if I cared about my (45:17 - 45:21)
sleep data more (45:19 - 45:23)
because if you were using one app that (45:21 - 45:25)
tracked your sleep and then you decided (45:23 - 45:26)
to switch to another app like the hot (45:25 - 45:29)
new app that came out maybe it's cheaper (45:26 - 45:32)
it would continue in apple Health to be (45:29 - 45:34)
like like you you don't skip a beat for (45:32 - 45:36)
like losing that data you know no matter (45:34 - 45:37)
what app you switch to it's still (45:36 - 45:40)
recorded there so they did talk about (45:37 - 45:42)
like potentially working with that they (45:40 - 45:43)
were like it's just not a Focus right (45:42 - 45:45)
now same with like Apple watch support (45:43 - 45:48)
or Google pixel watch support (45:45 - 45:50)
or Fitbit they were like yeah it's (45:48 - 45:51)
something on our radar it's something we (45:50 - 45:53)
want to look into it's just like we were (45:51 - 45:54)
focused on getting this out (45:53 - 45:57)
and you know for people to try it and (45:54 - 45:58)
enjoy it so (45:57 - 46:01)
I don't know a lot of like maybes in the (45:58 - 46:03)
future but also like (46:01 - 46:05)
how many people are gonna give it ten (46:03 - 46:07)
dollars a month and it will that make (46:05 - 46:09)
development faster or slower or scrap (46:07 - 46:12)
this or keep going like I don't know I (46:09 - 46:13)
think I think that ten dollars a month (46:12 - 46:17)
is is asking a whole lot for (46:13 - 46:19)
I've read all the rewards and I was like (46:17 - 46:21)
man some of these are super vague like (46:19 - 46:24)
what does that mean like awesome maybe (46:21 - 46:28)
if the maybe on uh being able to put (46:24 - 46:29)
these Pokemon you find when you're (46:28 - 46:32)
sleeping into Pokemon home becomes a (46:29 - 46:35)
feature then maybe paying for it each (46:32 - 46:39)
month maybe more more lucrative but but (46:35 - 46:41)
that's (46:39 - 46:42)
I didn't even think of that being a (46:41 - 46:44)
potential thing until I heard someone (46:42 - 46:47)
ask the question yeah yeah yeah (46:44 - 46:50)
um yeah I think (46:47 - 46:52)
I mean that would be nice that would be (46:50 - 46:54)
a cool feature if you find a shiny in (46:52 - 46:56)
Pokemon sleep it would be neat to be (46:54 - 46:58)
able to put it in homes and not to leave (46:56 - 47:00)
it in sleep forever (46:58 - 47:03)
yeah and because you you do have to like (47:00 - 47:05)
I think attempt to catch it there are (47:03 - 47:07)
Pokeballs Great Balls master balls Ultra (47:05 - 47:08)
Balls in the game (47:07 - 47:10)
luxury balls (47:08 - 47:13)
I didn't see that I'm out we're done I (47:10 - 47:15)
didn't see Premiere either oh we're (47:13 - 47:16)
really done (47:15 - 47:19)
um but (47:16 - 47:21)
yeah I mean like when it comes to (47:19 - 47:22)
shinies and when it comes to just (47:21 - 47:24)
Pokemon games in general there's always (47:22 - 47:26)
so RNG based so it's like what do you (47:24 - 47:28)
have to do to get one to appear when it (47:26 - 47:29)
appears do you even have like the (47:28 - 47:33)
biscuits or the pokeballs to get it like (47:29 - 47:37)
I don't know who knows we will see I I (47:33 - 47:39)
hope it's uh well it's coming from (47:37 - 47:40)
select button the same people who make (47:39 - 47:42)
Magikarp jump and I thought Magikarp (47:40 - 47:45)
jump was brilliant so the game side of (47:42 - 47:47)
things I think they're really good at (47:45 - 47:48)
making a gameplay Loop that you're (47:47 - 47:50)
excited to come back to (47:48 - 47:51)
um (47:50 - 47:55)
it's just like the question of (47:51 - 47:59)
what a week of rewards look like or are (47:55 - 48:01)
you going to log in every day to do this (47:59 - 48:02)
it doesn't look like the game's asking a (48:01 - 48:04)
lot of your time which can be either (48:02 - 48:06)
good or bad depending but yeah you're (48:04 - 48:07)
not going to be able to like sit there (48:06 - 48:08)
for like eight hours and be like I'm (48:07 - 48:10)
gonna grind that Pokemon sleep like (48:08 - 48:12)
you're you're just gonna run out of (48:10 - 48:14)
things to do relatively quickly (48:12 - 48:15)
um (48:14 - 48:18)
but I'm sure by the time this podcast (48:15 - 48:20)
goes up more people will have access to (48:18 - 48:23)
it and it will start rolling out for (48:20 - 48:25)
everyone but (48:23 - 48:28)
uh let's take a break uh when we get (48:25 - 48:30)
back we have some other news to talk (48:28 - 48:34)
about so we will be right back and we (48:30 - 48:37)
are back from our break (48:34 - 48:39)
uh (48:37 - 48:42)
this is a big deal maybe it's not I (48:39 - 48:43)
don't know (48:42 - 48:47)
I feel like most Comic-Con stuff is kind (48:43 - 48:48)
of a big deal (48:47 - 48:51)
I think Pokemon (48:48 - 48:54)
having a panel at Comic-Con is a big (48:51 - 48:56)
deal I doubt the information in it will (48:54 - 49:00)
be a big deal what is very interesting (48:56 - 49:03)
is due to the actors and writers strike (49:00 - 49:07)
this may be one of the only panels that (49:03 - 49:09)
actually has people from the company (49:07 - 49:12)
that's allowed to go (49:09 - 49:14)
oh because like for example if like (49:12 - 49:17)
Sarah NATO Cheney was still doing the (49:14 - 49:19)
anime she might be invited out but she (49:17 - 49:21)
should be especially (49:19 - 49:24)
she cannot go due to uh I guarantee (49:21 - 49:27)
she's part of sag yeah yeah because it's (49:24 - 49:29)
screen acting voice voiceovers are part (49:27 - 49:31)
of the Screen Actors Guild (49:29 - 49:32)
um and would be not allowed to go (49:31 - 49:37)
promote anything so Comic-Con (49:32 - 49:40)
uh uh this might be a bad news what (49:37 - 49:43)
you're saying yeah okay like Comic-Con (49:40 - 49:46)
none of the actors can go (49:43 - 49:49)
none and none of the writers can go so (49:46 - 49:50)
it's just (49:49 - 49:53)
probably producers (49:50 - 49:53)
there's a lot of value in producing (49:54 - 49:59)
some (49:57 - 50:02)
but I guarantee you some producers I (49:59 - 50:04)
guarantee you most people don't know who (50:02 - 50:06)
the producers are of most of your shows (50:04 - 50:09)
and since a lot of actors also produce (50:06 - 50:12)
those shows they also can't go because (50:09 - 50:14)
there would be crossing the picket line (50:12 - 50:17)
so I'm excited because a lot of people (50:14 - 50:19)
will probably be going to a Pokemon (50:17 - 50:22)
pedal full of people unlike a lot of the (50:19 - 50:23)
other ones (50:22 - 50:25)
um (50:23 - 50:25)
so for those that don't know this is off (50:25 - 50:29)
the official Pokemon website this is (50:28 - 50:31)
their press release Here Pokemon reveals (50:29 - 50:34)

about that a little bit (51:39 - 51:41)

panel hosted by Pokemon Master toy (52:14 - 52:19)
licensing partner Jazz Wares now I don't (52:17 - 52:21)
think they're on strike I think the toy (52:19 - 52:23)
industry is still yeah the toy industry (52:21 - 52:26)
is not yes on strike not yet I could (52:23 - 52:30)
join like hey why not look UPS is primed (52:26 - 52:33)
to join in about two weeks so the world (52:30 - 52:35)
is going to come to a screeching halt (52:33 - 52:38)
okay they could they could join (52:35 - 52:40)
um Jazz Wares is like very hit and miss (52:38 - 52:42)
with some of their toys uh yeah for the (52:40 - 52:44)
most part their toys are fine (52:42 - 52:47)
uh outside of the panels trainers will (52:44 - 52:48)
be able to engage with Pokemon brand (52:47 - 52:50)
throughout the various experience on the (52:48 - 52:51)
show floor such as photo opportunities (52:50 - 52:53)
fan focused giveaways and product (52:51 - 52:56)
previews at the Jazz Wares Booth the (52:53 - 52:59)
Mattel booth and the Bandai Namco Booth (52:56 - 53:00)
um they will feature Pokemon products (52:59 - 53:03)
from Bandai spirits and kawada (53:00 - 53:05)
respectfully I've never heard of that (53:03 - 53:06)
brand but okay (53:05 - 53:08)
those will be unique to the Comic-Con (53:06 - 53:10)
International attendees in addition (53:08 - 53:12)
trainers can purchase official Pokemon (53:10 - 53:15)
merchandise unique to Comic-Con at jazz (53:12 - 53:19)
Wares and Mattel's so yeah I mean like (53:15 - 53:22)
besides screenwriters and actors and (53:19 - 53:25)
voice actors being on strike which (53:22 - 53:26)
completely (53:25 - 53:28)
yes they should be yes they should get (53:26 - 53:31)
paid more well every a lot of people (53:28 - 53:32)
should be getting paid more for what (53:31 - 53:33)
they do correct just all across the (53:32 - 53:35)
board people (53:33 - 53:38)
the demand (53:35 - 53:39)
hahaha (53:38 - 53:42)
podcasting we need codes we don't need (53:39 - 53:44)
Jeff Bezos doesn't need like a 30th (53:42 - 53:46)
yacht it's fine (53:44 - 53:49)
people should get paid appropriately (53:46 - 53:52)
besides that (53:49 - 53:55)
it sounds like this is really cool yeah (53:52 - 53:59)
uh with what they're doing I do know I (53:55 - 54:01)
think the the jazzware (53:59 - 54:03)
they have like a starter figure (54:01 - 54:04)
collection that will only be at (54:03 - 54:06)
Comic-Con they're only like yeah it (54:04 - 54:08)
looks real cool it's really cool so if (54:06 - 54:10)
you are going (54:08 - 54:12)
that's cool for you if you don't get one (54:10 - 54:15)
probably somebody scalped it that sucks (54:12 - 54:18)
but like (54:15 - 54:20)
um I'm gonna guess this Comic-Con thing (54:18 - 54:22)
is because have how the Pokemon company (54:20 - 54:24)
works I'm gonna guess it's mostly (54:22 - 54:26)
pre-recorded and that you're going to (54:24 - 54:28)
walk into a room you're going to sit (54:26 - 54:31)
down they're going to hit play there (54:28 - 54:34)
might be a very small q a but what's (54:31 - 54:35)
going to happen is if they're like we (54:34 - 54:37)
have 15 minutes for Q a somebody's gonna (54:35 - 54:39)
get up there and ask the world's longest (54:37 - 54:42)
question yep that will give you the (54:39 - 54:43)
simplest answer and you'll be like ah (54:42 - 54:48)
you wasted the whole q a like thanks man (54:43 - 54:48)
like why didn't Ash and Gary hold hands (54:48 - 54:53)
in episode (54:51 - 54:55)
1024. they did it was cut out to the (54:53 - 54:58)
sensors next question (54:55 - 55:02)
is is Ash and Serena did they have liko (54:58 - 55:04)
it says hey you know the weird sorry not (55:02 - 55:07)
that yeah (55:04 - 55:11)
they showed in the second part of (55:07 - 55:13)
Pokemon Horizons this is not a spoiler I (55:11 - 55:15)
promise you don't worry I I'm trying to (55:13 - 55:17)
avoid spoilers as well (55:15 - 55:19)
but the second part of Pokemon Horizons (55:17 - 55:22)
is coming out in Japan and on the poster (55:19 - 55:25)
they showed kabu (55:22 - 55:29)
so they showed a gen 8 gym leader (55:25 - 55:33)
appearing in the series (55:29 - 55:36)
and so that might be our first sign that (55:33 - 55:38)
like nothing like this is the same (55:36 - 55:41)
universe like nothing has happened like (55:38 - 55:45)
kabu is already pretty old right like he (55:41 - 55:47)
doesn't look younger and he doesn't look (55:45 - 55:50)
older he looks exactly like he does (55:47 - 55:54)
which which my dream my fan fiction of (55:50 - 55:59)
the Pokemon anime is that liko sees Ash (55:54 - 56:01)
as champion and then she eventually (55:59 - 56:03)
wants to battle Ash and I think that (56:01 - 56:06)
would be cool (56:03 - 56:06)
once you get past a certain age you (56:07 - 56:11)
don't age as fast as people think you do (56:09 - 56:14)
like believe me (56:11 - 56:16)
people are like (56:14 - 56:18)
what it is it would be weird in their (56:16 - 56:20)
Universe I mean they definitely (56:18 - 56:22)
obviously time travel exists we have (56:20 - 56:25)
hoopa and we have uh yeah we have a (56:22 - 56:27)
bunch of things that can make time (56:25 - 56:30)
Distortion things happen right but like (56:27 - 56:33)
if you've done 27 years of these Gym (56:30 - 56:35)
Leaders always look like these Gym (56:33 - 56:38)
Leaders forever it would be weird to (56:35 - 56:42)
start aging up or down in a future anime (56:38 - 56:45)
so kabu being kabu (56:42 - 56:48)
also realizing that oh kabu didn't (56:45 - 56:50)
appear in any of the (56:48 - 56:53)
last three years he's here now or he (56:50 - 56:55)
will be here (56:53 - 56:56)
um I don't know I don't want to (56:55 - 56:58)
overthink it too much is officially (56:56 - 57:02)
middle-aged whatever that means I am (56:58 - 57:04)
officially middle-aged as well so I see (57:02 - 57:07)
like 35 and he's a millennial and he's (57:04 - 57:09)
like struggling to get a job right now (57:07 - 57:11)
and not getting paid enough is that what (57:09 - 57:13)
we're saying yeah absolutely cab was a (57:11 - 57:15)
millennial because we the funny thing is (57:13 - 57:18)
we know we know opal is 88. (57:15 - 57:22)
yeah because they state that but then (57:18 - 57:26)
and we know that Melody has to be (57:22 - 57:29)
at least (57:26 - 57:33)
in her 30s because she has a son that's (57:29 - 57:36)
around 20. never seen super sweet 16 on (57:33 - 57:39)
MTV I said he's 20. (57:36 - 57:41)
she has to be at least at least in her (57:39 - 57:44)
30s that's somewhere in her thighs we we (57:41 - 57:46)
know for sure that that dude's 20. I (57:44 - 57:47)
can't remember his name (57:46 - 57:51)
uh Gordy I think Gordy is (57:47 - 57:53)
I think he's supposed to be he might be (57:51 - 57:57)
19 or 20. he is in in there somewhere (57:53 - 58:00)
and like I think they say Milo is 17 (57:57 - 58:03)
which is like what (58:00 - 58:06)
yeah you guys yeah (58:03 - 58:11)
and this is 21. yeah and then isn't the (58:06 - 58:12)
Ghost Boy like the youngest gym leader (58:11 - 58:14)
ever yeah (58:12 - 58:17)
and then for whatever reason scarlet and (58:14 - 58:18)
violet they had to like up that by (58:17 - 58:21)
making it even younger Elite Four member (58:18 - 58:24)
for whatever worst reason worse (58:21 - 58:24)
because like Alistair is supposed to be (58:25 - 58:31)
around the same ages you as the (58:29 - 58:36)
character and the rivals so somewhere in (58:31 - 58:39)
the 11 to (58:36 - 58:42)
to 14 15. oh yeah I think they upped (58:39 - 58:44)
them to 14. yeah (58:42 - 58:47)
at one point (58:44 - 58:47)
um okay well talking about more products (58:49 - 58:54)
here uh speaking of (58:51 - 58:56)
tinkerton because that little I can't (58:54 - 58:58)
remember her name (58:56 - 59:01)
by elite four members (58:58 - 59:01)
I'm not sure about her name either (59:01 - 59:07)
uh everybody remembers Riku (59:04 - 59:09)

screenshot of July 5th of some of the (62:28 - 62:32)
questions that have been asked in this (62:31 - 62:34)
forum I don't know if a lot of them are (62:32 - 62:38)
appropriate but they lasted on the forum (62:34 - 62:40)
for quite a while (62:38 - 62:43)
yeah the best one I was able to find (62:40 - 62:46)
when I checked it earlier today on (62:43 - 62:48)
community.pokemon.com was a question of (62:46 - 62:51)
what cake would you bake for Giratina (62:48 - 62:56)
yeah I need to know the answer to that (62:51 - 62:56)
um (62:57 - 63:02)
I have uh oh I had the Forum up (62:58 - 63:04)
because I was looking at the recent (63:02 - 63:06)
questions (63:04 - 63:08)
um yeah it went from awesome to real (63:06 - 63:11)
boring and it's hard to navigate it's (63:08 - 63:14)
hard to get past the first page of a lot (63:11 - 63:15)
of them (63:14 - 63:17)
second page of these forums feels like (63:15 - 63:19)
second page at Google why am I here and (63:17 - 63:21)
how did I get here (63:19 - 63:24)
yeah it went from like (63:21 - 63:27)
the most immature what can we get away (63:24 - 63:30)
with questions because a mods might be (63:27 - 63:33)
asleep the general like if that's like a (63:30 - 63:35)
big Reddit meme of like mods are asleep (63:33 - 63:36)
post anything (63:35 - 63:39)
um to the most sterile (63:36 - 63:44)
Forum experience in the entire world (63:39 - 63:44)
um (63:44 - 63:48)
so they uh in the two weeks that this (63:45 - 63:49)
happened (63:48 - 63:53)
they have gotten moderation down (63:49 - 63:56)
to the point where (63:53 - 63:56)
yeah I like (63:56 - 64:02)
it's a communal way to submit bug (64:00 - 64:07)
reports that's pretty much it (64:02 - 64:07)
other than I still you have to go pretty (64:07 - 64:11)
deep to find some of the fun ones like (64:09 - 64:13)
top 10 Pokemon that are most likely to (64:11 - 64:16)
docs you on Twitter it's a solid thread (64:13 - 64:18)
that is a solid couldn't find no one (64:16 - 64:20)
didn't see that one I saw like which (64:18 - 64:22)
Pokemon do you think are four forklift (64:20 - 64:24)
certified you'll never you'll never (64:22 - 64:27)
guess who number one is is on this list (64:24 - 64:29)
a Pokemon most likely to dox you on (64:27 - 64:31)
Twitter (64:29 - 64:33)
I'm gonna guess (64:31 - 64:36)
onyx (64:33 - 64:36)
Onyx isn't even on the list (64:37 - 64:40)
Growlithe what (64:42 - 64:47)
Growlithe is number one yeah I mean chat (64:45 - 64:50)
out is three which makes more sense (64:47 - 64:53)
shout out makes more sense (64:50 - 64:55)
I would maybe put squawkability up there (64:53 - 64:57)
too yeah anything that actually he's up (64:55 - 65:00)
to no good Mewtwo is 10 and Meloetta is (64:57 - 65:02)
nine (65:00 - 65:04)
this is just a person who's got a hate (65:02 - 65:06)
agenda going (65:04 - 65:09)
I don't (65:06 - 65:09)
like (65:10 - 65:16)
we are as a society like circling back (65:11 - 65:18)
to early internet days you can see that (65:16 - 65:22)
with like threads which is just it's (65:18 - 65:25)
just the Facebook wall it's just yeah (65:22 - 65:27)
it's just the Facebook well (65:25 - 65:29)
it makes me feel comforted and warm (65:27 - 65:32)
like we went from (65:29 - 65:37)
chat rooms to then forums to then like (65:32 - 65:41)
IRC then to like facebook slash Twitter (65:37 - 65:45)
and now we're going backwards I mean we (65:41 - 65:47)
went from the bulletin board system (65:45 - 65:49)
which is where I started the good old (65:47 - 65:52)
BBS system (65:49 - 65:54)
where you would just go and read (65:52 - 65:57)
people's posts because you could always (65:54 - 65:58)
you could just put a thing up and then (65:57 - 66:01)
hope somebody came by and saw it because (65:58 - 66:03)
they dialed your number (66:01 - 66:06)
I remember when I was in high school and (66:03 - 66:09)
I was playing a lot of Mario Kart DS a (66:06 - 66:11)
lot of Animal Crossing wild World The (66:09 - 66:13)
Good the good old days and there was the (66:11 - 66:15)
official Nintendo forums and I would (66:13 - 66:18)
spend a lot of time on there and I can (66:15 - 66:20)
just like look back (66:18 - 66:23)
as an adult now to high school Steve (66:20 - 66:25)
wearing a chain wallet playing Mario (66:23 - 66:28)
Kart DS wearing jinko jeans to fit my DS (66:25 - 66:30)
in my pants (66:28 - 66:32)
and be like (66:30 - 66:35)
I as an adult would never want to (66:32 - 66:38)
interact with that age group on a forum (66:35 - 66:43)
like you're just not getting any like (66:38 - 66:45)
anything from that like I probably (66:43 - 66:48)
posted like oh Xbox sucks I love Mario (66:45 - 66:51)
and like (66:48 - 66:55)
as a kid being in a place with (66:51 - 66:57)
responsible adults can be a good thing (66:55 - 67:00)
you can learn a whole lot it there are (66:57 - 67:02)
things (67:00 - 67:06)
I know it is (67:02 - 67:06)
as a kid I got along with people who (67:07 - 67:11)
were a few years older than me a whole (67:10 - 67:13)
lot more than I got along with people my (67:11 - 67:15)
own age and I know that there are also (67:13 - 67:17)
young people in our communities (67:15 - 67:21)
here and there and yeah I think I think (67:17 - 67:23)
um I think the key is in the earlier (67:21 - 67:25)
wild days is there just were not (67:23 - 67:26)
responsible adults (67:25 - 67:30)
around a lot really watching what was (67:26 - 67:32)
going like when we say the internet was (67:30 - 67:35)
weird back in the day is because you had (67:32 - 67:39)
to invest kind of a lot to be able to (67:35 - 67:41)
get into it it was a very Niche thing (67:39 - 67:44)
like when I did the Bolton board systems (67:41 - 67:46)
it was a bunch of nerds making you would (67:44 - 67:49)
just make like a story game and then you (67:46 - 67:50)
would put it out there say hey come and (67:49 - 67:52)
interact with my story game it's kind of (67:50 - 67:54)
like a Choose Your Own Adventure and (67:52 - 67:58)
like you had very specific people and (67:54 - 67:59)
then (67:58 - 68:02)
you sort of as business like as it (67:59 - 68:05)
became business viable you'd have the (68:02 - 68:07)
business internet of people using it (68:05 - 68:11)
only for like important things and then (68:07 - 68:13)
still the weirdos who were like this is (68:11 - 68:15)
a cool Niche Hobby and so there's that (68:13 - 68:20)
time period of where you're running into (68:15 - 68:22)
some of the wildest people I have ever (68:20 - 68:24)
met and some people that I should have (68:22 - 68:27)
never been talking to (68:24 - 68:31)
never should be talking to this person (68:27 - 68:34)
and there were no there was no good (68:31 - 68:37)
gatekeeping like (68:34 - 68:41)
late 90s internet finally became a thing (68:37 - 68:43)
of people saying (68:41 - 68:45)
we should really be paying attention to (68:43 - 68:49)
what people are doing and who's talking (68:45 - 68:51)
to each other because some of these (68:49 - 68:52)
people should not be talking to kids (68:51 - 68:55)
yeah and there are a lot of really hard (68:52 - 68:57)
lines to draw there and a lot of places (68:55 - 68:59)
where they're not drawing the lines in (68:57 - 69:00)
places (68:59 - 69:03)
they should be yep yep (69:00 - 69:06)
yeah I just I don't think forums are it (69:03 - 69:09)
right now maybe in like two years forums (69:06 - 69:11)
will be it again but like when the rest (69:09 - 69:13)
of the internet's just robots talking to (69:11 - 69:15)
each other I mean the good thing about (69:13 - 69:20)
forums for in all ages (69:15 - 69:25)
type of feel is how slow it goes and how (69:20 - 69:29)
easier it is to sort of (69:25 - 69:29)
foreign (69:29 - 69:34)
moderate and because everything's locked (69:30 - 69:36)
in its own thread like you can just nuke (69:34 - 69:38)
the entire thread and there's not a lot (69:36 - 69:41)
of like I'm gonna I'm gonna like reply (69:38 - 69:45)
or repost this thread like forums are (69:41 - 69:49)
still somewhat easier to control and (69:45 - 69:52)
moderate so for what they're doing in (69:49 - 69:55)
the audience that they are hitting (69:52 - 69:58)
forums makes it it's better than saying (69:55 - 70:02)
hey ten-year-old go to Twitter and find (69:58 - 70:05)
some Pokemon stuff yeah I think I think (70:02 - 70:07)
in the sense of like (70:05 - 70:11)
if if I'm (70:07 - 70:13)
if I need a question about a specific (70:11 - 70:16)
like how does tropical beach work I (70:13 - 70:18)
don't understand the text on the card I (70:16 - 70:20)
could understand going to a forum and (70:18 - 70:22)
like maybe getting that answer right (70:20 - 70:23)
um (70:22 - 70:25)
you could also do that in like a Reddit (70:23 - 70:28)
although Reddit has also decided to (70:25 - 70:30)
self-implode and be a terrible service (70:28 - 70:32)
in the last like month which is super (70:30 - 70:33)
unfortunate (70:32 - 70:35)
um but like I I almost think like (70:33 - 70:40)
Reddit is better than a forum incense (70:35 - 70:43)
because you can get (70:40 - 70:46)
downvoted which is both good and bad but (70:43 - 70:47)
I think the good thing about getting (70:46 - 70:50)
downvoted is like when you just start (70:47 - 70:53)
asking really (70:50 - 70:55)
pointless (70:53 - 70:58)
silly like waste of time questions you (70:55 - 71:00)
kind of get that feedback instantly like (70:58 - 71:02)
no one wants this whereas like a forum (71:00 - 71:04)
there's kind of no feedback right like (71:02 - 71:06)
if there's no way to downvote like (71:04 - 71:08)
somebody can answer your question or (71:06 - 71:11)
it's like oh like who is the cutest (71:08 - 71:13)
Pokemon that I could get on my (71:11 - 71:15)
pillowcase like that could just go (71:13 - 71:18)
ignored or because somebody could just (71:15 - 71:20)
write Charizard and you'd be like okay I (71:18 - 71:22)
guess I'll buy a Charizard pillowcase (71:20 - 71:25)
um like I think there is more feedback (71:22 - 71:28)
to a person because like when I switched (71:25 - 71:31)
from forums to Reddit and I would like (71:28 - 71:33)
post something and then it would get (71:31 - 71:35)
upvoted I would be like oh cool I'll (71:33 - 71:36)
just like there's that serotonin hit I (71:35 - 71:38)
will just post something similar and (71:36 - 71:39)
because people like it (71:38 - 71:42)
and then if I posted like (71:39 - 71:45)
what's your favorite shoe and then on a (71:42 - 71:47)
Pokemon for space and it got downvoted (71:45 - 71:49)
be like oh okay I guess I guess we're (71:47 - 71:50)
not talking about that there like there (71:49 - 71:52)
is that kind of feedback I mean there's (71:50 - 71:54)
slight feedback on the forums because (71:52 - 71:56)
things that get more reply they go back (71:54 - 71:59)
to the front page like the things that (71:56 - 72:02)
don't get a lot of replies go (71:59 - 72:06)
Into The Ether so there's a little bit (72:02 - 72:08)
of that and one thing that you know that (72:06 - 72:10)
you can kind of see on the forums is you (72:08 - 72:12)
can see how many people have looked at (72:10 - 72:14)
it (72:12 - 72:16)
um so it does (72:14 - 72:17)
let's do that (72:16 - 72:20)
somewhat I mean we don't know exactly (72:17 - 72:22)
what their (72:20 - 72:25)
requirements are like (72:22 - 72:27)
if somebody replies this automatically (72:25 - 72:30)
go to the front does it not like what is (72:27 - 72:32)
what how does their forums actually work (72:30 - 72:35)
but yeah they they don't have (72:32 - 72:37)
strong direct feedback as far as I can (72:35 - 72:39)
see other things like somebody replying (72:37 - 72:43)
this and saying this ain't it dog (72:39 - 72:44)
um but like is this even worth it to the (72:43 - 72:46)
Pokemon company like they have to now (72:44 - 72:48)
have somebody (72:46 - 72:50)
I can't imagine this is all getting Auto (72:48 - 72:51)
modded they have to have somebody (72:50 - 72:54)
looking at these posts (72:51 - 72:54)
sure yeah there's a hopefully in there (72:54 - 72:59)
um I mean they probably have the (72:57 - 73:02)
community the community moderators that (72:59 - 73:05)
run their other social medias are now (73:02 - 73:08)
required to also keep on top of this I (73:05 - 73:09)
guarantee you they just said we're (73:08 - 73:11)
launching the forums and this is now (73:09 - 73:14)
part of your job Duty (73:11 - 73:14)
yeah I mean I I already have problems (73:16 - 73:21)
with Pokemon moderation when it comes to (73:19 - 73:24)
like twitch yeah (73:21 - 73:28)
and again I don't think (73:24 - 73:28)
like I'm not saying I'm like not trying (73:28 - 73:31)
to keep young people from using the (73:29 - 73:33)
internet that's not it like we have (73:31 - 73:36)
younger fans in our Discord we have (73:33 - 73:38)
younger fans in our slack and they've (73:36 - 73:40)
been great but it's also because like we (73:38 - 73:43)
have a lot of like responsible not all (73:40 - 73:44)
of you are responsible don't get carried (73:43 - 73:46)
away we have a lot of responsible people (73:44 - 73:49)
in our community that like make that (73:46 - 73:50)
happen (73:49 - 73:52)
um and I have to like directly moderate (73:50 - 73:53)
my own like (73:52 - 73:56)
twitch chat which is a gateway to either (73:53 - 74:00)
like slack or Discord and I like I had (73:56 - 74:02)
like a situation the other night where (74:00 - 74:03)
somebody came in (74:02 - 74:05)
and they they were like what's your (74:03 - 74:06)
favorite Pokemon what's your favorite (74:05 - 74:08)
shiny what's your favorite Shiny Pokemon (74:06 - 74:09)
like it was just like question after (74:08 - 74:11)
question and when you've been on like (74:09 - 74:12)
the internet long enough you just know (74:11 - 74:14)
that that person happens to be younger (74:12 - 74:17)
because it doesn't it because I've done (74:14 - 74:18)
this song and dance before but like you (74:17 - 74:20)
give them an answer and like there's no (74:18 - 74:21)
response to that answer it's just like (74:20 - 74:23)
okay next question right it's like (74:21 - 74:26)
please entertain me and only me to (74:23 - 74:29)
ignore I can't I can't see the other 200 (74:26 - 74:31)
people here I'm just I can't read the (74:29 - 74:32)
room I'm just asking you a question (74:31 - 74:34)
because you're the streamer and I'm the (74:32 - 74:35)
viewer (74:34 - 74:36)
um (74:35 - 74:38)
and (74:36 - 74:41)
you know like when I try to like ask (74:38 - 74:42)
them questions like can we like okay (74:41 - 74:44)
like I get it you're probably younger (74:42 - 74:45)
you keep asking me questions let me ask (74:44 - 74:47)
you a question it's like we're not (74:45 - 74:49)
having a conversation like you asking me (74:47 - 74:50)
question after question is not a (74:49 - 74:52)
conversation let me ask you a question (74:50 - 74:54)
and it wasn't going that way (74:52 - 74:55)
and then finally they just like typed (74:54 - 74:58)
exclamation point fart in the chat (74:55 - 74:59)
because they wanted to see if that did (74:58 - 75:01)
anything and I was like okay well yeah (74:59 - 75:04)
you know chill out like it's a late (75:01 - 75:07)
maybe maybe you know like and they (75:04 - 75:09)
didn't come back after the timeout which (75:07 - 75:11)
is like standard kid Behavior right they (75:09 - 75:13)
just wanted attention I didn't give them (75:11 - 75:15)
the attention they wanted (75:13 - 75:17)
I tried to like have a conversation and (75:15 - 75:18)
they probably moved on to a different (75:17 - 75:20)
stream like (75:18 - 75:22)
and for the most part that's kind of why (75:20 - 75:24)
my stream doesn't have a lot of games (75:22 - 75:26)
because like I'm not here to babysit (75:24 - 75:28)
like like if you want to come in and you (75:26 - 75:30)
fit in and you have a good time great (75:28 - 75:32)
awesome like there are kids that know (75:30 - 75:34)
how to read the room and there are kids (75:32 - 75:36)
that like just watch they don't they (75:34 - 75:38)
don't need to they don't need to (75:36 - 75:39)
commentate or entertain they might say (75:38 - 75:42)
hi they might say goodbye (75:39 - 75:44)
um but like (75:42 - 75:46)
I don't know I look at this forum thing (75:44 - 75:47)
and I'm like I don't think this is it (75:46 - 75:50)
but I don't think this is it for a (75:47 - 75:51)
variety of reasons but I also think like (75:50 - 75:54)
now you've created more work for (75:51 - 75:56)
yourself Pokemon yeah when I heard about (75:54 - 75:58)
it at first I thought that maybe this is (75:56 - 76:00)
what they were trying to Pivot to (75:58 - 76:03)
because the social internet is dying but (76:00 - 76:05)
it doesn't even seem like that kind of (76:03 - 76:07)
thing they're not posting news on there (76:05 - 76:10)
this place just exists it just exists it (76:07 - 76:13)
just exists for people (76:10 - 76:16)
who want to go there to go there and (76:13 - 76:17)
talk (76:16 - 76:21)
it does feel very it does feel very (76:17 - 76:25)
dated like like visiting this thing and (76:21 - 76:26)
I'm like (76:25 - 76:28)
I remember having to do this because (76:26 - 76:31)
there was nothing else and this is just (76:28 - 76:34)
what you did like I was part of a huge (76:31 - 76:36)
Forum I met a lot of friends that way (76:34 - 76:38)
but like (76:36 - 76:38)
it's not the worst way to sort of start (76:38 - 76:46)
finding a community but it also feels (76:43 - 76:48)
really (76:46 - 76:51)
dated a real dated way to find the (76:48 - 76:55)
community yes and I'm very curious who (76:51 - 77:00)
at in Seattle in like Seattle like (76:55 - 77:03)
pitched hey we should we should extend (77:00 - 77:05)
our Forum to more General topics so they (77:03 - 77:06)
would have got that approved by like (77:05 - 77:09)
Japan and was is Japan still running on (77:06 - 77:13)
forums are they like yeah is (77:09 - 77:13)
like I get I get it I get like hey we (77:13 - 77:19)
have fans they might even use Reddit or (77:16 - 77:20)
Twitter they might not have a community (77:19 - 77:22)
they might not have anywhere to go and (77:20 - 77:27)
they need to ask how burn works on this (77:22 - 77:30)
specific card or maybe they like need to (77:27 - 77:33)
know like what is the best nature for a (77:30 - 77:35)
competitive Arcanine and this would be a (77:33 - 77:37)
place to ask and like that makes sense (77:35 - 77:40)
but it's not happening yeah but those (77:37 - 77:42)
situations are not happening at all it's (77:40 - 77:43)
just like (77:42 - 77:47)
what's your favorite Pokemon t-shirt (77:43 - 77:47)
I mean I'm trying to look through I (77:47 - 77:50)
think I found (77:49 - 77:55)
one that's like actually asking (77:50 - 77:59)
like Hey how do you do this or there are (77:55 - 78:02)
a lot they're just all in the unanswered (77:59 - 78:04)
questions yeah they're just all the ones (78:02 - 78:06)
that nobody's replied to (78:04 - 78:08)
right because the people that would (78:06 - 78:10)
apply (78:08 - 78:12)
would probably not have any desire to go (78:10 - 78:14)
there because the other questions push (78:12 - 78:16)
them away like I think the last time I (78:14 - 78:18)
actually seriously used a forum was like (78:16 - 78:22)
a car forum where it was like all car (78:18 - 78:24)
talk and you could search for a specific (78:22 - 78:26)
issue and you could click it and then (78:24 - 78:27)
you could scroll down and you could see (78:26 - 78:29)
suggestions and it was actually like (78:27 - 78:32)
really helpful but I could and I could (78:29 - 78:33)
get probably similar things from like (78:32 - 78:36)
Reddit because Reddit also like pops up (78:33 - 78:38)
on Google (78:36 - 78:39)
but like you would think you would apply (78:38 - 78:42)
the car talk logic of like I don't know (78:39 - 78:43)
like (78:42 - 78:45)
what breaks to get for my car and then (78:43 - 78:46)
people are recommending Brands and like (78:45 - 78:49)
that is helpful but like (78:46 - 78:52)
and I think the things they want are not (78:49 - 78:54)
happening and if they are they're not (78:52 - 78:56)
getting answered which is therefore (78:54 - 78:58)
still not happening yeah (78:56 - 79:01)
like I'm on page five and I'm still (78:58 - 79:03)
searching for (79:01 - 79:07)
I'm still searching for anything (79:03 - 79:07)
like I look at the front page and I'm (79:07 - 79:12)
just like I have no desire to answer any (79:09 - 79:14)
of these questions or to participate in (79:12 - 79:16)
any of this (79:14 - 79:18)
any of these conversations (79:16 - 79:20)
yeah I mean I am not the audience for (79:18 - 79:23)
this who is the audience (79:20 - 79:26)
couldn't tell you (79:23 - 79:28)
somebody one of them on the front pages (79:26 - 79:32)
short attention span versus Pokemon yeah (79:28 - 79:35)
what what what does that mean and then (79:32 - 79:37)
somebody just wrote a novel I ain't (79:35 - 79:39)
reading this (79:37 - 79:39)
Hi man I ain't got time for that (79:42 - 79:49)
I'm stuck I'm so confused about the (79:46 - 79:52)
title of his post (79:49 - 79:52)
anyways that's our show for you guys (79:55 - 79:59)
today (79:57 - 79:59)
um I'm sure there are some Pokemon news (80:00 - 80:05)
we missed but uh everything can announce (80:02 - 80:08)
rates at some point right the next one (80:05 - 80:11)
I think they did all of July (80:08 - 80:13)
was it Reggie alecky and uh something (80:11 - 80:16)
else after aliki no you talk about uh (80:13 - 80:18)
yeah scarlet and violet yeah Scarlet (80:16 - 80:20)
Violet um by the time this podcast goes (80:18 - 80:22)
up they could announce rila boom which (80:20 - 80:24)
would be the last starter in the game (80:22 - 80:25)
code (80:24 - 80:26)
um there are no more starters after this (80:25 - 80:28)
I keep getting comments of when is (80:26 - 80:31)
Meganium coming is not in the game these (80:28 - 80:33)
are the only starters from now going (80:31 - 80:35)
forward you got in Pokemon Snap take (80:33 - 80:36)
what you can get actually I don't know (80:35 - 80:38)
it could be with DLC (80:36 - 80:40)
um there are (80:38 - 80:43)
there there is the the rumor and (80:40 - 80:46)
speculation of Mewtwo being a seven star (80:43 - 80:48)
raid boss this should surprise no one (80:46 - 80:49)
because (80:48 - 80:52)
Mewtwo has been a raid boss before and (80:49 - 80:54)
sword and shield (80:52 - 80:56)
uh to talk about that rumor real quick (80:54 - 80:59)
the rumor is that a Mewtwo would appear (80:56 - 81:01)
in seven star raids we do not know it's (80:59 - 81:03)
Terror type (81:01 - 81:06)
um it would be non-catchable which is (81:03 - 81:08)
not a surprise because again you could (81:06 - 81:09)
not catch it in sword and shield there (81:08 - 81:12)
was also urshifu (81:09 - 81:15)
glass rear calorics Zara Aura these were (81:12 - 81:18)
also non-catchable raids (81:15 - 81:21)
the speculation though is if you bring a (81:18 - 81:24)
mu to the raid the MU would get the (81:21 - 81:29)
mightiest Mark for defeating Mewtwo this (81:24 - 81:31)
would make sense because Niantic is (81:29 - 81:33)
brought back the shiny Mew questline in (81:31 - 81:35)
Pokemon go (81:33 - 81:37)
also Mewtwo is coming to Pokemon unite (81:35 - 81:41)
yep also (81:37 - 81:44)
Mewtwo would convince people to pick up (81:41 - 81:45)
this game again I the amount of people (81:44 - 81:47)
that are like I'm going back to Pokemon (81:45 - 81:49)
unite because of Mewtwo is mind-blowing (81:47 - 81:52)
yeah like like super like this is the (81:49 - 81:53)
Pokemon that's bringing people back as (81:52 - 81:56)
me and there's like two of them which is (81:53 - 81:59)
also weird like we know that Mewtwo is (81:56 - 82:01)
popular we know that people love him he (81:59 - 82:04)
goes crazy in Pokemon go as well but (82:01 - 82:07)
like to see that wave of people move (82:04 - 82:10)
from like go to you know not the same (82:07 - 82:11)
people but like the wave of excitement (82:10 - 82:13)
go like Mewtwo's coming to unite I'm (82:11 - 82:15)
going to boot back up unite so like (82:13 - 82:19)
Mewtwo moves he's he's moving (82:15 - 82:21)
um selling units left and right making (82:19 - 82:24)
closings the whole thing is works the (82:21 - 82:28)
room every time so Mewtwo could be next (82:24 - 82:31)
rilla boom could be next we could get (82:28 - 82:32)
nothing (82:31 - 82:34)
um if it is Mewtwo ideally it sounds (82:32 - 82:35)
like they want you to bring him you (82:34 - 82:37)
because like first movie Mewtwo versus (82:35 - 82:40)
Mew blah blah you get the mark on it (82:37 - 82:41)
um wouldn't know what to do without (82:40 - 82:43)
Terror type (82:41 - 82:45)
whether that's psychic dark (82:43 - 82:47)
steel I don't know (82:45 - 82:48)
I don't know what works in that (82:47 - 82:49)
situation (82:48 - 82:51)
but (82:49 - 82:52)
um (82:51 - 82:54)
I'm super worried they're gonna do (82:52 - 82:57)
something like that over worlds (82:54 - 83:00)
and then it's like worlds is happening (82:57 - 83:02)
this super selled out event that people (83:00 - 83:04)
can't even get to like the parades or (83:02 - 83:06)
the cruise ship or like the Pokemon (83:04 - 83:08)
Center because it's like they they (83:06 - 83:11)
should never do worlds in Japan again it (83:08 - 83:13)
hasn't even happened but it is already a (83:11 - 83:16)
mess like I I know a handful of people (83:13 - 83:17)
that were planning on like still (83:16 - 83:19)
planning on going to Worlds they don't (83:17 - 83:22)
have tickets for anything (83:19 - 83:24)
they're just going to show up and be (83:22 - 83:27)
like this is happening I can't go to it (83:24 - 83:29)
I was planning on going to it I guess (83:27 - 83:31)
I'm just gonna do other Japanese things (83:29 - 83:34)
like it is insane (83:31 - 83:38)
I expected well expected in the sense (83:34 - 83:41)
that like Japan loves Pokemon (83:38 - 83:43)
they should have said it was going to be (83:41 - 83:45)
a raffle system (83:43 - 83:46)
so that people didn't buy their plane (83:45 - 83:47)
tickets (83:46 - 83:49)
yeah before they knew they weren't going (83:47 - 83:51)
to be able to get in yeah (83:49 - 83:54)
I feel bad like I know I'm like a (83:51 - 83:56)
Pokemon partner I know I'm invited I (83:54 - 83:58)
have no clue what I'm going to like I (83:56 - 84:00)
don't know like they they're like make (83:58 - 84:02)

parade if I'm supposed to sign up for (84:06 - 84:09)
the parade I missed it I don't know (84:08 - 84:12)
anyone who is going to Japan I know a (84:09 - 84:13)
lot of other content creators are going (84:12 - 84:14)
to Japan I don't know a single one that (84:13 - 84:16)
got approved for any of these events (84:14 - 84:19)
like the parade the the like the (84:16 - 84:23)
fireworks show the concert the TCG (84:19 - 84:25)

like I I can't find a single person who (84:25 - 84:33)
got like they won they're like raffle (84:28 - 84:36)
like I don't know if in the system I (84:33 - 84:37)
don't know if this is a real thing I (84:36 - 84:39)
don't know if in the system like they (84:37 - 84:43)
prioritize like locals (84:39 - 84:43)
over like (84:44 - 84:47)
because you have to put your address (84:46 - 84:52)
yeah I that would be (84:47 - 84:52)
that would be potentially a lawsuit but (84:53 - 84:58)
I feel like it's something they would (84:57 - 85:01)
have to State outright people would have (84:58 - 85:04)
been talking about it (85:01 - 85:04)
but out of like (85:04 - 85:08)
I don't know like 40 other content (85:06 - 85:09)
creators that are going most on their (85:08 - 85:11)
own dime (85:09 - 85:12)
I don't know a single one that got (85:11 - 85:15)
approved for like the six events they (85:12 - 85:16)
all applied for I didn't even apply for (85:15 - 85:18)
