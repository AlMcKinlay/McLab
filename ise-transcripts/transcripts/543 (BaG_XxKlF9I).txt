what's up everyone welcome to the 543rd (0:24 - 0:30)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:27 - 0:32)
super effective I'm your host Steve with (0:30 - 0:34)
me today is Hannah (0:32 - 0:37)
I am back hello (0:34 - 0:40)
Hannah yeah we gotta get the listeners (0:37 - 0:43)
up to speed one fact about you (0:40 - 0:45)
oh (0:43 - 0:45)
don't be so surprising like that uh one (0:45 - 0:50)
fact about me is that I was a high (0:48 - 0:52)
school wrestler all through high school (0:50 - 0:54)
I was on the wrestling team and I was (0:52 - 0:56)
the captain of the wrestling team for (0:54 - 0:58)
the last two years so that's not Pokemon (0:56 - 1:00)
fact but it's pretty fun fact all right (0:58 - 1:01)
well the podcast isn't going to get any (1:00 - 1:03)
more exciting so thanks for listening (1:01 - 1:06)
thank you (1:03 - 1:06)
I didn't know that about you uh Bob is (1:06 - 1:13)
back as well yeah Steve invited me back (1:10 - 1:16)
so I do apologize to everybody so uh (1:13 - 1:20)
uh Bob uh a fact about you I mean you (1:16 - 1:22)
probably know this but I always feel (1:20 - 1:24)
like I should say it uh I lost on two (1:22 - 1:29)
national televised game shows and it is (1:24 - 1:31)
it is my claim to fame I actually have (1:29 - 1:33)
two times game show loser in my LinkedIn (1:31 - 1:37)
profile and Twitter so I I think the one (1:33 - 1:39)
of them I know which is the ten thousand (1:37 - 1:42)
dollar pyramid right a hundred thousand (1:39 - 1:44)
dollar pyramid 100 000 that was back in (1:42 - 1:47)
2016 on ABC and then there was a show (1:44 - 1:49)
back in 2009 on The Game Show Network (1:47 - 1:51)
called chain reaction and I was a dumb (1:49 - 1:54)
19 year old that decided to go to New (1:51 - 1:55)
York City for a day to go on a word game (1:54 - 1:59)
show and we got slaughtered so there we (1:55 - 2:01)
go was that one a team it was a team (1:59 - 2:03)
yeah it was like me and my two friends (2:01 - 2:05)
we just skipped school one day to go on (2:03 - 2:07)
this cable access game nothing a cable (2:05 - 2:08)
game show (2:07 - 2:10)
um but it was lots of fun I had a great (2:08 - 2:13)
time but I'm hoping for an amazing story (2:10 - 2:15)
oh thank you third time's the charm so (2:13 - 2:16)
the third show we'll see what happens (2:15 - 2:18)
I'll let you know when that is what (2:16 - 2:20)
would what what is the what is the dream (2:18 - 2:23)
game show (2:20 - 2:23)
To Be A Millionaire but um since that's (2:23 - 2:29)
no longer on the air my best (2:25 - 2:31)
my best chance is probably Wheel of (2:29 - 2:33)
Fortune people like Wheel of Fortune (2:31 - 2:36)
though I I listen I get to spin a wheel (2:33 - 2:38)
and it's a word game because pyramid's a (2:36 - 2:40)
word game chain reaction was a word game (2:38 - 2:42)
I should probably keep that uh together (2:40 - 2:45)
so yeah I feel like my toxic trait is (2:42 - 2:47)
thinking I can win a game show in (2:45 - 2:50)
reality I can't ah go A Deal or No Deal (2:47 - 2:53)
you'll be good I know I can't so I'm (2:50 - 2:56)
good laughs (2:53 - 2:58)
all right well we have a a loaded (2:56 - 3:00)
episode for y'all today uh for the (2:58 - 3:02)
purposes of scarlet and violet (3:00 - 3:04)
uh there will of course still be no (3:02 - 3:07)
story spoilers uh although we'll be (3:04 - 3:08)
talking about Charizard raids and (3:07 - 3:10)
possible counters for the Charizard's (3:08 - 3:13)
raids so they might include new Pokemon (3:10 - 3:15)
um but you know if you haven't seen (3:13 - 3:16)
credits you don't worry about story (3:15 - 3:20)
stuff uh the mini series is all done (3:16 - 3:22)
um we was called super picnic club uh (3:20 - 3:24)
all those episodes are on YouTube Apple (3:22 - 3:27)
podcast uh Spotify for some reason (3:24 - 3:29)
episode 4 is missing on Stitcher I don't (3:27 - 3:33)
know why I I I cannot fix this if just (3:29 - 3:35)
again behind the scenes of podcasting I (3:33 - 3:38)
upload in two places I guess (3:35 - 3:40)
three places one is specifically YouTube (3:38 - 3:43)
because it's video and then one is the (3:40 - 3:45)
main podcast feed that goes out to Apple (3:43 - 3:48)
Spotify Stitcher Amazon Pandora goes out (3:45 - 3:50)
to all of those so I only upload it once (3:48 - 3:52)
and then all those sites (3:50 - 3:54)
they like suck it up like a like a (3:52 - 3:57)
Roomba and then the last place I upload (3:54 - 4:00)
is specifically the premium feed (3:57 - 4:01)
specifically to patreon and apple (4:00 - 4:03)
podcast so when when somebody's like oh (4:01 - 4:04)
stitcher's broken I don't specifically (4:03 - 4:06)
upload a Stitcher (4:04 - 4:09)
they just suck it up and so I have no (4:06 - 4:10)
clue why episode 4 is missing and (4:09 - 4:11)
there's nothing I can do besides hit the (4:10 - 4:13)
refresh button and it doesn't work so (4:11 - 4:15)
I'm sorry to any Stitcher people there (4:13 - 4:17)
is an episode four I promise you it's (4:15 - 4:18)
somewhere (4:17 - 4:20)
um podcasting is a little weird so those (4:18 - 4:23)
are all out there uh we serious was (4:20 - 4:25)
called super picnic club we never once (4:23 - 4:27)
talked about picnics (4:25 - 4:30)
um very very powerful (4:27 - 4:32)
very par for the course (4:30 - 4:34)
uh we do have a lot of Pokemon news (4:32 - 4:37)
today uh surprisingly for December (4:34 - 4:41)
um so we'll try to get through all of us (4:37 - 4:44)
um the first one uh I just think is cool (4:41 - 4:47)
Pokemon news I guess uh I kind of wish I (4:44 - 4:49)
knew this was a thing when I was in (4:47 - 4:51)
Korea but I think it just started like a (4:49 - 4:53)
couple weeks ago so I would have missed (4:51 - 4:54)
it anyways (4:53 - 4:55)
they've done this time to time I think (4:54 - 4:57)
in the (4:55 - 4:59)
uh how long have I been doing the show (4:57 - 5:00)
way too long on the 12 years I've been (4:59 - 5:02)
doing this show I think I think this (5:00 - 5:03)
pops up every like two or three years (5:02 - 5:06)
that there is a limited Pokemon themed (5:03 - 5:09)
hotel well there's another one (5:06 - 5:12)
um this is off nintendosoup.com uh South (5:09 - 5:14)
Korean Hotel Soul Dragon City is running (5:12 - 5:16)
a Pokemon themed hotel package for a (5:14 - 5:18)
limited time from now (5:16 - 5:21)
until February 15th you can get a (5:18 - 5:24)
Pokemon themed room stock with a variety (5:21 - 5:26)
of limited edition Goods including (5:24 - 5:28)
plushies blanket stickers more this (5:26 - 5:31)
package includes a breakfast for two as (5:28 - 5:33)
well as access to pool and gym (5:31 - 5:35)
facilities they are now part of the (5:33 - 5:39)
Novell brand within Dragon City (5:35 - 5:41)
um and that's about it uh it looks (5:39 - 5:43)
really great (5:41 - 5:44)
um (5:43 - 5:48)
yeah it's cute it's tiny yeah I mean (5:44 - 5:50)
when you compare it to the other Pokemon (5:48 - 5:53)
hotel rooms that have been out there I (5:50 - 5:56)
like that it's stylized that it's not (5:53 - 5:58)
just pictures of the Pokemon that's one (5:56 - 5:59)
of the problems I have with Pokemon (5:58 - 6:01)
merch that it's usually just the stock (5:59 - 6:03)
pictures of the Pokemon this one is (6:01 - 6:05)
actually kind of stuff (6:03 - 6:05)
can you can you keep plushies or do they (6:05 - 6:10)
stay in the room that's why I want to (6:08 - 6:14)
know don't know (6:10 - 6:14)
and they had like a dog plushie and they (6:15 - 6:21)
said you could take the dog plushie but (6:19 - 6:23)
they would charge you 35 but they would (6:21 - 6:26)
donate that 35 to charity okay that's a (6:23 - 6:29)
plus side so like and they take it they (6:26 - 6:31)
had like uh pillows too and they were (6:29 - 6:33)
like you can take the pillows but we'll (6:31 - 6:35)
charge you and then donate it to charity (6:33 - 6:39)
so okay when I read this as like gym (6:35 - 6:41)
facilities I mean come on I'm like oh (6:39 - 6:44)
Pokemon gym come on have that theme get (6:41 - 6:46)
the get the music playing you go into (6:44 - 6:47)
the gym can you do your elliptical (6:46 - 6:49)
workout do you guys you get some uh some (6:47 - 6:51)
scrolling Valley music playing pretty (6:49 - 6:53)
cool but I think I think this is nice I (6:51 - 6:54)
think if you know if you're going on (6:53 - 6:56)
vacation like honestly Steve when you (6:54 - 6:57)
went to (6:56 - 6:58)
um South Korea this would have been (6:57 - 7:01)
great for YouTube it's available but I (6:58 - 7:03)
think it's great for two people like if (7:01 - 7:04)
it's a good deal to get breakfast and (7:03 - 7:06)
you get some good amenities and if you (7:04 - 7:08)
can get the plushies to take home I love (7:06 - 7:10)
that uh giant Pikachu plush in the (7:08 - 7:12)
background for those um (7:10 - 7:15)
somewhere but it's really cool I like it (7:12 - 7:18)
the the thing that (7:15 - 7:21)
took me like two days to realize and (7:18 - 7:23)
South Korea was that there was gas masks (7:21 - 7:27)
everywhere like not like face masks like (7:23 - 7:30)
actual like gas masks from like Fallout (7:27 - 7:32)
and like they're in your hotel room (7:30 - 7:35)
they're in the subway they're once you (7:32 - 7:37)
see them you're like oh you we can just (7:35 - 7:40)
be bombed at any time and uh in case you (7:37 - 7:43)
need a gas mask they're everywhere it's (7:40 - 7:46)
a little jarring it is but considerate (7:43 - 7:49)
it's considerate (7:46 - 7:51)
I guess it's just the landscape of the (7:49 - 7:52)
world we live in I guess just be (7:51 - 7:54)
prepared and uh better yeah (7:52 - 7:57)
then you know then not have it so you (7:54 - 7:59)
know to be fair South Korea and Japan (7:57 - 8:03)
are very close to North Korea (7:59 - 8:04)
can't say I've ever seen that in a K (8:03 - 8:07)
drama but good to know yeah it's good to (8:04 - 8:09)
know that there are there is indeed a (8:07 - 8:11)
gas mask underneath my refrigerator that (8:09 - 8:14)
I can grab at any moment (8:11 - 8:16)
um I will say though too I just booked a (8:14 - 8:18)
hotel for Las Vegas (8:16 - 8:22)
um for the uh Pokemon go thing and it's (8:18 - 8:24)
still shocking to me (8:22 - 8:28)
how cheap hotels were in South Korea and (8:24 - 8:31)
Japan and Germany like I looked at my (8:28 - 8:34)
Germany hotel and it was like five days (8:31 - 8:37)
for like 300 and I love that hotel was (8:34 - 8:39)
nice minus like the air conditioning the (8:37 - 8:40)
hotel didn't have Americans but that's (8:39 - 8:42)
most of Germany which makes me never (8:40 - 8:45)
want to go back to Germany (8:42 - 8:48)
um but the Las Vegas hotel nowhere near (8:45 - 8:52)
300 significantly more uh oh I think (8:48 - 8:55)
international travel I feel is like much (8:52 - 8:57)
cheaper now than domestic traveling like (8:55 - 8:58)
if you want to go like across the (8:57 - 9:00)
country you're probably gonna pay double (8:58 - 9:02)
for a you know plane ticket and (9:00 - 9:04)
accommodations then let's say you want (9:02 - 9:06)
to go to like I don't know London for a (9:04 - 9:08)
week like I want to go back to London (9:06 - 9:09)
it's like it's cheaper to go to London (9:08 - 9:12)
than to like San Jose sometimes we're (9:09 - 9:14)
like what is this (9:12 - 9:16)
London's probably much more exciting (9:14 - 9:20)
than him I think so too yeah (9:16 - 9:20)
uh all right uh this uh Hannah (9:21 - 9:27)
foreshadowed here uh speaking of just (9:24 - 9:30)
slapping Pokemon images on things uh the (9:27 - 9:32)
hundreds (9:30 - 9:34)
reveals its complete Pokemon collection (9:32 - 9:37)
this is off hypebeast.com (9:34 - 9:40)
I want look I I never heard of (9:37 - 9:43)
millionaire boys millionaire whatever (9:40 - 9:45)
that one was though I think it was the (9:43 - 9:47)
Billionaire Boys Club I think so yes (9:45 - 9:49)
Pharrell Williams (9:47 - 9:52)
um I I think this is another very high (9:49 - 9:54)
end designer (9:52 - 9:55)
um thing (9:54 - 9:58)
let's see it says uh bringing elements (9:55 - 10:00)
of Pokemon Universal Life The Duo has (9:58 - 10:02)
looked back oh the hundreds is did they (10:00 - 10:05)
say who it's by teaser from Bobby (10:02 - 10:09)
hundred who is Bobby Hunter is that (10:05 - 10:12)
I don't know who Bobby hundred is (10:09 - 10:15)
uh but the them and Pokemon it looks (10:12 - 10:17)
like Bobby hundred is into nfts that's (10:15 - 10:21)
you know makes sense uh fan favorite of (10:17 - 10:22)
Pokemon including uh Bulbasaur (10:21 - 10:24)
Charmander Squirtle joined by Cubone (10:22 - 10:27)
Mewtwo of course Pikachu uh various (10:24 - 10:30)
designs from the iconic Pokemon notable (10:27 - 10:33)
pieces are a letterman jacket (10:30 - 10:36)
a cardigan sweater (10:33 - 10:39)
um and then the the ash hat which I (10:36 - 10:40)
think caught a lot of people's attention (10:39 - 10:42)
if I feel like if you're not following (10:40 - 10:44)
fashion or you're not following these (10:42 - 10:46)
big drops I think the ash hat alone (10:44 - 10:50)
probably made it somewhere in front of (10:46 - 10:51)
you on social media or something but the (10:50 - 10:55)
Ash Ketchum hat was a strap back uh made (10:51 - 10:59)
of Premium wool and leather (10:55 - 10:59)
they've made for a while yeah yeah (11:00 - 11:07)
totally uh this drop and happened on I (11:03 - 11:09)
think Wednesday night at 9 00 p.m (11:07 - 11:10)
Pacific time (11:09 - 11:14)
uh I I clicked on it I was like I bet I (11:10 - 11:16)
bet a t-shirt's gonna be 50 bucks yeah (11:14 - 11:20)
t-shirt was indeed 50 (11:16 - 11:22)
um I think the Letterman jacket was 200. (11:20 - 11:27)
which you could argue isn't the worst (11:22 - 11:31)
for a jacket Pokemon themed like jackets (11:27 - 11:33)
are pretty you know (11:31 - 11:36)
not a 50 t-shirt that's for sure yeah (11:33 - 11:38)
Leatherman jackets in particular are (11:36 - 11:41)
also pretty expensive I I never got one (11:38 - 11:42)
in high school even though I had a bunch (11:41 - 11:44)
of letters because they were just too (11:42 - 11:45)
expensive (11:44 - 11:47)
yeah and you were captain of the (11:45 - 11:49)
wrestling team (11:47 - 11:49)
it didn't come with the package it (11:51 - 11:54)
didn't come with the package did not I (11:52 - 11:58)
got a Starbucks gift card instead (11:54 - 11:58)
I looked so here's the thing I looked at (11:58 - 12:02)
the cardigan (12:00 - 12:05)
uh because I've been told for many years (12:02 - 12:08)
I would look good in a cardigan and I (12:05 - 12:11)
went to h m like a month ago and they (12:08 - 12:13)
had an 80 cardigan and I was like what (12:11 - 12:15)
I'm not spending 80 on a cardigan the (12:13 - 12:18)
Pokemon cardigan was 120. and I was like (12:15 - 12:22)
ah the Pokemon tax I I like the cardigan (12:18 - 12:24)
the best out of all this like well the (12:22 - 12:26)
ash hat was great fantastic I used to (12:24 - 12:28)
wear hats although I'm assuming most (12:26 - 12:29)
people buying these hats probably not (12:28 - 12:31)
wearing them (12:29 - 12:32)
um (12:31 - 12:37)
uh cardigan was 129. I was like ah let (12:32 - 12:39)
me finish editing this podcast I'll come (12:37 - 12:41)
back and then about two hours later I (12:39 - 12:43)
went back and it was it it and (12:41 - 12:45)
everything else was pretty much sold out (12:43 - 12:46)
besides like the T-shirt like the (12:45 - 12:48)
Letterman jacket I think sold out in the (12:46 - 12:49)
ash hat for sure sold out instantly and (12:48 - 12:52)
letterman jacket sold out Cardigans sold (12:49 - 12:53)
out (12:52 - 12:56)
all the interesting stuff yeah yeah uh (12:53 - 12:59)
price was never a factor here like as (12:56 - 13:00)
much as somebody could be like I would (12:59 - 13:02)
never pay fifty dollars for a t-shirt (13:00 - 13:05)
you don't worry somebody else will and (13:02 - 13:07)
they they did I think the whole set is (13:05 - 13:10)
sold out foreign (13:07 - 13:10)
but just like the this is what I don't (13:11 - 13:17)
get just like the Billionaire Boys or (13:14 - 13:19)
whatever that was (13:17 - 13:22)
these designs are so just (13:19 - 13:26)
like not like part almost yeah I was (13:22 - 13:29)
gonna say some of the uh clothing and I (13:26 - 13:31)
got I think the Hat's the best part of (13:29 - 13:33)
this entire package the socks I hope I (13:31 - 13:36)
get the socks myself but I look at some (13:33 - 13:38)
of the apparel they have and that giant (13:36 - 13:41)
Pokemon logo this is like something I (13:38 - 13:43)
would probably see in like a department (13:41 - 13:45)
store I'm not trying to like you know (13:43 - 13:48)
you know maybe I am trying to like say (13:45 - 13:50)
this is not a good design but yeah just (13:48 - 13:52)
a giant logo like I I love the Mewtwo (13:50 - 13:54)
shirt I think the beauty shirt's really (13:52 - 13:56)
cool with the design and just the um and (13:54 - 13:58)
I like subtle Pokemon design on some (13:56 - 14:00)
clothing like I think on the Pokemon (13:58 - 14:03)
website when it had a Oma Cat when they (14:00 - 14:05)
had like those sweat those sweaters with (14:03 - 14:06)
different Pokemon designs yeah that was (14:05 - 14:08)
really that was really cool and I really (14:06 - 14:09)
like that when they have a different (14:08 - 14:12)
unique take on showing different Pokemon (14:09 - 14:14)
and having the color of the shirt (14:12 - 14:16)
represents the uh the typing of the (14:14 - 14:19)
Pokemon some of these outfits I mean (14:16 - 14:21)
I probably wouldn't buy something with a (14:19 - 14:23)
giant Pokemon logo stamped on top of it (14:21 - 14:25)
I probably more I probably buy more of (14:23 - 14:28)
the subtle close like the Mewtwo one the (14:25 - 14:30)
hat or even though it's I feel like (14:28 - 14:32)
though with oh just if it just says (14:30 - 14:33)
Pokemon I feel like that's what you get (14:32 - 14:35)
at like Target for like 20 bucks right (14:33 - 14:39)
yeah yeah exactly yes we have Pokemon at (14:35 - 14:42)
home it's called the target shirt like (14:39 - 14:44)
this like this this hoodie is still in (14:42 - 14:46)
stock hoodie Zippy if Al's here I think (14:44 - 14:48)
he'd call it no it's there's no zipper (14:46 - 14:51)
so it's not a zippy uh it's it's a (14:48 - 14:53)
hundred dollar hoodie and it just says (14:51 - 14:56)
the hundreds and there's just a very (14:53 - 14:58)
tiny by the way and there's just a (14:56 - 15:00)
little Pikachu in between the word the (14:58 - 15:02)
and hundreds and it's like this didn't (15:00 - 15:03)
sell out (15:02 - 15:05)
but also (15:03 - 15:08)
there what there's nothing special about (15:05 - 15:09)
I mean it comes in three different (15:08 - 15:12)
colors (15:09 - 15:12)
I'm sure I'm sure that you know it's (15:12 - 15:17)
it's fleece lined that means it's (15:15 - 15:20)
probably a thicker hoodie right a split (15:17 - 15:23)
Stitch double needle in the seams I (15:20 - 15:25)
seems like it'll last forever there you (15:23 - 15:27)
know you gotta set in rib collar with (15:25 - 15:31)
shoulder taping i i as far as hoodies go (15:27 - 15:34)
seems like a nice hoodie but like if I'm (15:31 - 15:36)
I'm paying also the Pokemon tax and (15:34 - 15:39)
there's barely any Pokemon on the city (15:36 - 15:41)
they want something just a little (15:39 - 15:44)
something (15:41 - 15:44)
yeah I mean I like um yeah I I think (15:44 - 15:49)
that was one I saw it had the hundreds (15:47 - 15:51)
but I actually had a Cubone on it which (15:49 - 15:52)
is which is nice and it had like the (15:51 - 15:54)
lettering in in the bones and I think (15:52 - 15:56)
that's pretty cool to kind of like uh (15:54 - 15:59)
have a yeah recognizable one that was (15:56 - 16:00)
Cubone one has bones on the arms and (15:59 - 16:02)
that's kind of a cool touch that's cool (16:00 - 16:05)
yeah but the clip-on stuff I'm not gonna (16:02 - 16:08)
drop you know three figures on something (16:05 - 16:10)
like that uh the Hat I I think to your (16:08 - 16:13)
point Hannah that the half was just was (16:10 - 16:14)
really good so if you're if you're (16:13 - 16:16)
cosplaying Ash or you just want to have (16:14 - 16:19)
it like a Pokemon item in your house to (16:16 - 16:21)
represent Ash and then just the (16:19 - 16:23)
nostalgic that hat I can see why it sold (16:21 - 16:25)
out but other than that like I said (16:23 - 16:27)
probably the socks for me would be would (16:25 - 16:30)
be my extent of a purchase I am so (16:27 - 16:32)
surprised the Hat wasn't 100 bucks (16:30 - 16:34)
because it would have sold out just just (16:32 - 16:36)
as fast oh bites yeah absolutely (16:34 - 16:37)
absolutely (16:36 - 16:39)
um I have an ash hat from 20 years ago (16:37 - 16:43)
and that was not surpassed in the I (16:39 - 16:45)
still think that that was the best Dash (16:43 - 16:47)
hat that had been out there until maybe (16:45 - 16:50)
this one wow yeah (16:47 - 16:54)
um I I look I think I would more be more (16:50 - 16:57)
likely to pull a trigger on a hoodie or (16:54 - 16:59)
a shirt if if just the designs like (16:57 - 17:00)
stood out this is like the weirdest (16:59 - 17:03)
maybe I don't understand premium fashion (17:00 - 17:06)
it just is so weird to me that like (17:03 - 17:09)
this 120 hoodie just says Pokemon on it (17:06 - 17:12)
and then in lower than smaller fonts as (17:09 - 17:15)
the hundreds it's like but what what (17:12 - 17:17)
what am I paying for (17:15 - 17:20)
I'm also I'm also when I try to buy (17:17 - 17:22)
clothing online and because I fluctuate (17:20 - 17:25)
between sizes like really easily I'm (17:22 - 17:26)
always afraid I want to buy a size (17:25 - 17:29)
online whether it's a sweatshirt or a (17:26 - 17:31)
jacket or a t-shirt it's always gonna be (17:29 - 17:33)
one size too small and that's why I'm (17:31 - 17:35)
always hesitant on buying clothing (17:33 - 17:37)
online but if I go to a store and try it (17:35 - 17:39)
on and obviously if it fits I buy if not (17:37 - 17:41)
I get one size up and one size down but (17:39 - 17:43)
I'm I don't know if any of you have come (17:41 - 17:45)
across that issue where these different (17:43 - 17:47)
companies if you buy something you think (17:45 - 17:50)
it's in your size it's like well I spent (17:47 - 17:53)
100 200 and it's one size too small and (17:50 - 17:55)
I don't know what to do can I return it (17:53 - 17:57)
to that return policy what do I do with (17:55 - 18:00)
my life I don't know (17:57 - 18:02)
um I can tell you that the the (18:00 - 18:06)
Billionaire Boys whatever uh they sent (18:02 - 18:09)
me a shirt they sent me the me too one (18:06 - 18:12)
and it's like I I took it out of the (18:09 - 18:14)
the plastic sleeve it came in or (18:12 - 18:16)
whatever because that made it fancier I (18:14 - 18:19)
guess and it's I can already say it say (18:16 - 18:21)
it stupid like I've never worn it but I (18:19 - 18:23)
can tell you it's way too big it's very (18:21 - 18:26)
much like maybe maybe not maybe not too (18:23 - 18:28)
big is the right word it's just very (18:26 - 18:32)
like relaxed oversized is like the fit (18:28 - 18:35)
for that particular brand (18:32 - 18:36)
and I was like oh I (18:35 - 18:40)
I don't like this I guess I guess I'll (18:36 - 18:42)
let it like style you're going for I'll (18:40 - 18:44)
put I'll put it next to the ancient Mew (18:42 - 18:46)
next to the Burger King there you go (18:44 - 18:49)
Gold Coast gold cards I'll appreciate (18:46 - 18:50)
and value a little bit (18:49 - 18:52)
um maybe you know in 20 years the (18:50 - 18:54)
somebody will be like man remember that (18:52 - 18:57)
billionaire boy drop I wish I could find (18:54 - 19:00)
one of those t-shirts and then you'll (18:57 - 19:01)
get into a Nintendo life article like (19:00 - 19:04)
this guy has the most rarest shirt ever (19:01 - 19:06)
and it's can pay off your mortgage oh (19:04 - 19:09)
yeah 100 of these shirts are made (19:06 - 19:12)
going for however much on eBay (19:09 - 19:15)
oh I'm actually I wouldn't be surprised (19:12 - 19:17)
if a lot of this stuff is on eBay right (19:15 - 19:19)
yeah (19:17 - 19:21)
I do like this cardigan though (19:19 - 19:25)
it is it's bright yellow yeah (19:21 - 19:28)
it's a little yellow in my life (19:25 - 19:32)
hey hey it is seven gauge acrylic neon (19:28 - 19:35)
wool and mohair blend I don't know what (19:32 - 19:37)
any of that means it sounds premium (19:35 - 19:39)
though sounds fancy hold the phone (19:37 - 19:44)
it sounds sounds like 129 dollars (19:39 - 19:44)
uh speaking of fancy (19:45 - 19:51)
we now have official there's not really (19:48 - 19:54)
an article for this except like a couple (19:51 - 19:57)
people verified from the TCG Set uh we (19:54 - 20:00)
now have official recognition (19:57 - 20:03)
uh I was wrong I will admit I did not (20:00 - 20:06)
think gen 9 was going to go over a (20:03 - 20:08)
thousand Pokemon I thought they were (20:06 - 20:10)
gonna save that for Gen 10 I don't know (20:08 - 20:12)
if to me that just seemed like a (20:10 - 20:14)
10 years a thousand Pokemon kind of (20:12 - 20:16)
Celebration (20:14 - 20:17)
and I was like they're gonna make a big (20:16 - 20:20)
deal about the 1000 Pokemon uh they (20:17 - 20:24)
haven't they didn't yet uh uh but we now (20:20 - 20:26)
know who the thousandth Pokemon is it is (20:24 - 20:29)
a golden go or goldango I'm not sure how (20:26 - 20:34)
to say it uh because both sound okay (20:29 - 20:34)
I say go Dango I think I think that's (20:35 - 20:40)
how I saw it I've been reading at Golden (20:37 - 20:43)
go yeah we gotta wait for the anime I (20:40 - 20:45)
guess because I I don't know I I (20:43 - 20:47)
sincerely don't know which one it would (20:45 - 20:49)
be (20:47 - 20:49)
um (20:49 - 20:52)
but uh that is that is the a thousandth (20:49 - 20:54)
post that is the a thousandth Pokemon uh (20:52 - 20:58)
which makes gimme ghoul the 999 Pokemon (20:54 - 21:00)
uh I think it is fitting in the sense (20:58 - 21:02)
that you do have to collect pretty much (21:00 - 21:05)
a thousand or 999 coins to evolve (21:02 - 21:08)
illegal into gold Dango golden go (21:05 - 21:10)
um and (21:08 - 21:12)
there is something (21:10 - 21:15)
I guess I guess we can talk about this (21:12 - 21:17)
but I don't know what you guys thoughts (21:15 - 21:19)
on this Pokemon are but it is like (21:17 - 21:22)
people have thoughts on this Pokemon it (21:19 - 21:25)
is yeah like like somebody will look at (21:22 - 21:27)
like spy dots and be like yep that's a (21:25 - 21:29)
Pokemon I'll never think about again (21:27 - 21:31)
which is fair fair some people like (21:29 - 21:34)
spied UPS my opinion is like I will (21:31 - 21:35)
probably never put this on a team or (21:34 - 21:37)
never I don't even know what its ability (21:35 - 21:39)
is I have zero interest in spite Ops it (21:37 - 21:41)
was the only Pokemon on my team that (21:39 - 21:42)
could learn false swipes so it stayed on (21:41 - 21:44)
my team all throughout until I got to (21:42 - 21:47)
Champion so I'm a little bit fond of it (21:44 - 21:49)
uh but there's a handful of Pokemon that (21:47 - 21:51)
you would never think about again I (21:49 - 21:53)
think I think golden go could push the (21:51 - 21:56)
lines of uh like for some people uh like (21:53 - 21:59)
a vanillite or a trubbish of like people (21:56 - 22:01)
either love it or hate it (21:59 - 22:04)
but what are your guys's thoughts (22:01 - 22:09)
he um well he uh it looks like a 90s (22:04 - 22:12)
mascot from like a cartoon a box of (22:09 - 22:13)
cereal (22:12 - 22:15)
um I've seen string cheese comparisons (22:13 - 22:18)
to go to Golden go (22:15 - 22:20)
um I will say (22:18 - 22:23)
um from a VGC competitive uh standpoint (22:20 - 22:25)
I've been seeing this Pokemon on a lot (22:23 - 22:28)
of teams uh it's been viable from what (22:25 - 22:32)
I've seen from the series one BGC uh (22:28 - 22:34)
games especially when it has uh like I (22:32 - 22:36)
think it's movies like Make It Rain (22:34 - 22:38)
where it can make it rain which is which (22:36 - 22:41)
is the view oh beautiful I think a lot (22:38 - 22:43)
of these names are getting really good (22:41 - 22:44)
from Pokemon company I really do enjoy (22:43 - 22:46)
it (22:44 - 22:47)
um I I know the shiny is one of the (22:46 - 22:49)
worst shinies I think they've ever (22:47 - 22:51)
created uh because there's like no I (22:49 - 22:53)
think the belt's different in a shiny (22:51 - 22:55)
form of of godango but I don't know yes (22:53 - 22:57)
and it's currently locked as well it's (22:55 - 22:59)
very locked so you can't you know if you (22:57 - 23:02)
get one then put don't it it's not real (22:59 - 23:05)
yet don't yeah we don't get rid of it (23:02 - 23:08)
um so to follow up on Bob said go Dango (23:05 - 23:11)
is the number one most used competitive (23:08 - 23:13)
Pokemon right now it is on 30 of teams (23:11 - 23:17)
which is which is a lot uh that is that (23:13 - 23:18)
is a lot (23:17 - 23:20)
um there is a good variety in season one (23:18 - 23:23)
um but just in in perspective though (23:20 - 23:27)
when we ended Series 13 or 14 in sword (23:23 - 23:30)
and shield uh incineroar was on 64 of (23:27 - 23:32)
teams (23:30 - 23:32)
um (23:32 - 23:35)
but incinerary gonna support Pokemon yep (23:32 - 23:38)
so it could fit easily uh gold Dango is (23:35 - 23:40)
a main attacking Pokemon so that would (23:38 - 23:42)
be closer to like azashian or a Kyogre (23:40 - 23:44)
or Groudon you you want to do damage (23:42 - 23:45)
with it (23:44 - 23:48)
um Hannah what are your thoughts on uh (23:45 - 23:50)
golden go (23:48 - 23:53)
um visually I agree that it just looks (23:50 - 23:54)
like a mascot I think it looks like one (23:53 - 23:56)
of those waving things outside of a car (23:54 - 23:58)
sales (23:56 - 23:58)
that is the first thing I thought of (24:01 - 24:06)
um but competitively I've heard some (24:03 - 24:08)
people saying that it's kind of an early (24:06 - 24:09)
competitive Pokemon and that once people (24:08 - 24:12)
get more used to the range of what's (24:09 - 24:14)
available in these games that it'll (24:12 - 24:17)
start to fall off (24:14 - 24:17)
um maybe possible (24:17 - 24:24)
uh I mean yeah totally possible I mean (24:21 - 24:27)
we saw like together kiss be very (24:24 - 24:28)
dominant for like four seasons and then (24:27 - 24:32)
completely disappear and vanish (24:28 - 24:34)
uh it does it does have the signature (24:32 - 24:36)
move uh Make It Rain (24:34 - 24:39)
which does 120 damage it's 100 accurate (24:36 - 24:41)
uh it's a special attacker which is (24:39 - 24:43)
really great for Intimidators although (24:41 - 24:47)
uh they really uh all they had to do was (24:43 - 24:49)
introduce one new held item and now (24:47 - 24:53)
intimidate seems completely useless uh (24:49 - 24:55)
in this in this series which is pretty (24:53 - 24:56)
crazy (24:55 - 24:59)
um and also I I think it's ability also (24:56 - 25:00)
is what propelled it to number one here (24:59 - 25:03)
it's ability as good as gold (25:00 - 25:05)
um which is it's the only Pokemon I can (25:03 - 25:07)
learn it uh this Pokemon with this (25:05 - 25:09)
ability is unaffected by other status (25:07 - 25:13)
type moves so momentum fails and the (25:09 - 25:15)
user does not faint so actually probably (25:13 - 25:19)
okay for shiny hunting uh because they (25:15 - 25:22)
can't momentum you uh momento uh curse (25:19 - 25:25)
used by Ghost type Pokemon will fail (25:22 - 25:28)
without uh reducing HP strengths that (25:25 - 25:32)
strength sap will fail (25:28 - 25:32)
um (25:32 - 25:36)
and then obviously uh the ability (25:33 - 25:40)
actually States a body pure solid gold (25:36 - 25:44)
and forgives the Pokemon full immunity (25:40 - 25:46)
to other Pokemon's status type moves so (25:44 - 25:48)
you can't burn it you can't confuse it (25:46 - 25:50)
you can't confuse it you can't (25:48 - 25:51)
um (25:50 - 25:54)
paralyze it all very good things right (25:51 - 25:57)
like uh especially in competitive uh (25:54 - 25:59)
paralyzing the other Pokemon is a form (25:57 - 26:01)
of speed control it's a form of speed (25:59 - 26:03)
control that I personally like until I (26:01 - 26:07)
miss my 90 Thunder Wave (26:03 - 26:11)
so you have a (26:07 - 26:14)
very powerful attacker (26:11 - 26:17)
um it's special attack is 133 crazy high (26:14 - 26:20)
really high it has an incredible typing (26:17 - 26:22)
incredible signature move of Make It (26:20 - 26:24)
Rain (26:22 - 26:25)
um and then you have this like goofy (26:24 - 26:29)
design so in the sense of going back to (26:25 - 26:32)
making the thousandth Pokemon Special it (26:29 - 26:35)
does seem that it is special uh they (26:32 - 26:38)
have a very specific way to evolve it it (26:35 - 26:41)
has that tie-in with Pokemon go (26:38 - 26:42)
um they just haven't promoted it yet so (26:41 - 26:44)
I don't know if they're waiting for the (26:42 - 26:46)
TCG or the anime or what they're doing (26:44 - 26:48)
to like (26:46 - 26:50)
show it off (26:48 - 26:53)
um what is that one video for its (26:50 - 26:56)
pre-evolution when it started tying in (26:53 - 26:57)
with Pokemon go (26:56 - 27:00)
oh the walking one uh the cool video (26:57 - 27:01)
with both the professors (27:00 - 27:04)
oh yeah yeah yeah they had that little (27:01 - 27:07)
Storybook in there talking about how it (27:04 - 27:09)
would eventually evolve after picking up (27:07 - 27:10)
all the coins (27:09 - 27:12)
and that seems like maybe they could (27:10 - 27:17)
continue off of that they might not but (27:12 - 27:19)
I would not be surprised if this Pokemon (27:17 - 27:23)
gets its own like box TCG special pack (27:19 - 27:25)
uh yeah I I can't imagine they don't (27:23 - 27:29)
make a big deal about this Pokemon uh (27:25 - 27:31)
also randomly like have you guys walked (27:29 - 27:33)
with this thing it like just shows up on (27:31 - 27:36)
a surfboard no I have not and that is (27:33 - 27:40)
news to me oh yeah excited if you walk (27:36 - 27:43)
with it he like surfs behind you like he (27:40 - 27:47)
has a surfboard like he is really like (27:43 - 27:50)
mascotty in the way of like 90s mascots (27:47 - 27:51)
like I don't think that I don't think (27:50 - 27:53)
that's a coincidence either I think (27:51 - 27:56)
that's what he was like designed after I (27:53 - 27:59)
Googled just the Pokedex (27:56 - 28:01)
um snapshot like if I'm scarlet and (27:59 - 28:03)
violet when you catch a Pokemon and (28:01 - 28:05)
choose that snapshot uh in the book (28:03 - 28:08)
it's kind of cool I'm not gonna lie (28:05 - 28:12)
um I you're right 90s Vibes I'm here for (28:08 - 28:13)
it (28:12 - 28:15)
um I think we'll see more of this (28:13 - 28:17)
Pokemon in the future to both your (28:15 - 28:19)
points um especially (28:17 - 28:21)
anime or tie-ins with I think especially (28:19 - 28:23)
with Pokemon go because since we've (28:21 - 28:24)
already seen gimme ghoul in the wild I'm (28:23 - 28:26)
sure something will come about with uh (28:24 - 28:30)
with this uh uh go Dango but yeah I mean (28:26 - 28:33)
I to me it's fine I think um we'll see (28:30 - 28:35)
in VGC for a bit I think it's a really (28:33 - 28:38)
solid answer to a lot of BBC uh (28:35 - 28:40)
Shenanigans that's out there and for (28:38 - 28:42)
someone like me who just got back into (28:40 - 28:44)
VGC and trying to figure out what do all (28:42 - 28:46)
these Pokemon do what's this Terror type (28:44 - 28:49)
oh my goodness my strategy is ruined (28:46 - 28:52)
um I will say I think having this like (28:49 - 28:53)
on your team just like in the back just (28:52 - 28:55)
to bring out like late game even just (28:53 - 28:56)
say hey you know what I'm down to (28:55 - 28:59)
Pokemon let me bring out gold Dango let (28:56 - 29:01)
me just start going ham on you you can't (28:59 - 29:03)
affect me he has a hard hitting Make It (29:01 - 29:05)
Rain hit uh I think we'll see it for a (29:03 - 29:07)
while uh in competitive and I think (29:05 - 29:09)
we'll see more of it just in in the (29:07 - 29:10)
media (29:09 - 29:13)
yeah I and I think they (29:10 - 29:14)
you know when people are like I don't (29:13 - 29:16)
get why game freak shiny lock stuff this (29:14 - 29:19)
is a really good case in point why they (29:16 - 29:20)
shiny locked it because they are going (29:19 - 29:22)
to do a huge tie-in with go They're (29:20 - 29:24)
gonna do like another meltan Mel metal (29:22 - 29:26)
situation they're going (29:24 - 29:30)
ideally or hopefully when they celebrate (29:26 - 29:32)
that this is the a thousandth Pokemon to (29:30 - 29:33)
make this a big deal they're probably (29:32 - 29:36)
gonna be like and you can get a shiny (29:33 - 29:39)
one this weekend in Pokemon go it is (29:36 - 29:42)
free to play please not like there's no (29:39 - 29:45)
way that they're not going to use both (29:42 - 29:48)
games to advertise each other (29:45 - 29:50)
um because I think I think they said (29:48 - 29:52)
like you'll be able to get gimme ghoul (29:50 - 29:56)
outside of its chest yep only in Pokemon (29:52 - 29:59)
go do either of you think that the Gimme (29:56 - 30:01)
ghoul that you get from go might evolve (29:59 - 30:05)
into a different form of golden go oh I (30:01 - 30:07)
don't know that's interesting (30:05 - 30:08)
um (30:07 - 30:11)
probably not but it's something I have (30:08 - 30:13)
thought of yeah well they said that the (30:11 - 30:15)
you'd be able to do it in like spring or (30:13 - 30:18)
something they did say like early 2023 (30:15 - 30:21)
for that event (30:18 - 30:23)
um now we know that gimme ghoul evolves (30:21 - 30:24)
um (30:23 - 30:26)
yeah I I don't know I like I like golden (30:24 - 30:29)
go uh speaking of scarlet and violet (30:26 - 30:32)
Charizard is coming back but we we're (30:29 - 30:34)
gonna take a break real quick and when (30:32 - 30:37)
we come back we will talk about uh that (30:34 - 30:40)
I just hate everyone that brings Azuma (30:37 - 30:43)
rule to every single raid uh and this is (30:40 - 30:45)
gonna be my PSA for the next 30 minutes (30:43 - 30:48)
uh we will be right back (30:45 - 30:51)
and we are back from our break (30:48 - 30:54)
and let's a Charizard's coming back (30:51 - 30:57)
we're back Charizard's coming back what (30:54 - 31:00)
a time to be alive (30:57 - 31:02)
um so we're recording this on December (31:00 - 31:03)
11th which means this podcast will go up (31:02 - 31:06)
on December 12th uh Charizard should (31:03 - 31:07)
return (31:06 - 31:08)
um (31:07 - 31:13)
at 12 a.m UTC time that is probably six (31:08 - 31:16)
to seven p.m I can't remember (31:13 - 31:19)
daylight savings time uh 6 to 7 P.M on (31:16 - 31:23)
Thursday the 15th uh and then it will go (31:19 - 31:28)
until six to seven on the 18th so you'll (31:23 - 31:29)
have all weekend although that's also (31:28 - 31:31)
Community Day weekend (31:29 - 31:33)
to do Charizard (31:31 - 31:34)
um (31:33 - 31:37)
this is the second time we'll see if (31:34 - 31:40)
they changed it at any way probably (31:37 - 31:43)
maybe probably not uh it's probably (31:40 - 31:45)
gonna be the same probably not yeah um (31:43 - 31:49)
they could maybe uh there could possibly (31:45 - 31:52)
be an update around this time (31:49 - 31:54)
um I was I was pretty confident our (31:52 - 31:56)
first update was going to be when they (31:54 - 31:58)
were going to open up competitive that (31:56 - 32:00)
did happen because they had to fix (31:58 - 32:02)
competitive also the same time Charizard (32:00 - 32:04)
appeared so there could be another (32:02 - 32:06)
update around this time there was issues (32:04 - 32:08)
with the Charizard raid I don't know if (32:06 - 32:10)
you have experienced this but pretty (32:08 - 32:13)
much like its health bar would just uh (32:10 - 32:15)
randomly go back up to halfway uh when (32:13 - 32:19)
it was down to a sliver uh people said (32:15 - 32:22)
that that was because that it had more (32:19 - 32:26)
Health than what was showing so when you (32:22 - 32:28)
were doing so much damage it wasn't (32:26 - 32:29)
calculating it fast enough and that's (32:28 - 32:31)
why I was jumping back up (32:29 - 32:34)
I don't know if that's true uh I don't (32:31 - 32:35)
think people care if that's true or not (32:34 - 32:38)
people just go well it had one HP and (32:35 - 32:40)
now it has 50h that seems like a bug (32:38 - 32:42)
either way right correct like I don't (32:40 - 32:45)
think that reasoning makes it any more (32:42 - 32:46)
acceptable (32:45 - 32:49)
um it had it was almost dead and now (32:46 - 32:51)
it's not almost dead and we lost I think (32:49 - 32:53)
that is that is what people are upset (32:51 - 32:55)
about (32:53 - 32:57)
um (32:55 - 33:00)
I I have opinions about this right how (32:57 - 33:01)
did you guys feel about it if you guys (33:00 - 33:04)
did it or not do it I know I don't think (33:01 - 33:05)
Hannah finished the game at that point (33:04 - 33:06)
but I think you you could have still (33:05 - 33:09)
joined raids uh I think I'd finish the (33:06 - 33:12)
game but I would I didn't have time to (33:09 - 33:14)
build a Pokemon for it so I didn't get (33:12 - 33:15)
any done (33:14 - 33:18)
Bob what about you (33:15 - 33:21)
uh yeah I had uh some friends let me (33:18 - 33:24)
some Pokemon uh and I got all the ones (33:21 - 33:26)
that people were using uh I got the Grim (33:24 - 33:31)
snull uh I got the uh docs bun uh I got (33:26 - 33:35)
even an Zuma Roll Just because not YOLO (33:31 - 33:38)
um but no I I I did them and I I knew (33:35 - 33:40)
right after the bat the whole Azuma real (33:38 - 33:43)
Strat was just bad (33:40 - 33:46)
um and I have encountered the whole HP (33:43 - 33:49)
going to one and then me celebrating and (33:46 - 33:51)
then it jumps up back halfway and I go (33:49 - 33:54)
this is Shenanigans I beat this thing (33:51 - 33:56)
what's going on (33:54 - 33:59)
um but then you know as time went on and (33:56 - 34:01)
you know Steve you'll probably talk more (33:59 - 34:03)
about this in a little bit we we found (34:01 - 34:04)
out that we actually found Pokemon that (34:03 - 34:07)
actually were effective against this (34:04 - 34:09)
battle like it's a level 100 Charizard (34:07 - 34:11)
you really need to bring level 100 (34:09 - 34:13)
Pokemon in this and you should really be (34:11 - 34:15)
coordinating four human players I don't (34:13 - 34:19)
think you can really solo this (34:15 - 34:19)
maybe you can help me figure that out (34:22 - 34:26)
because I tried and I'm a bad player (34:24 - 34:28)
apparently but because because I was (34:26 - 34:31)
using Grim small because well in in four (34:28 - 34:32)
percent raids I was playing support I (34:31 - 34:34)
was doing Grim smile with like the light (34:32 - 34:36)
screen and then the fake tears and (34:34 - 34:38)
getting all that off but (34:36 - 34:39)
um yeah maybe you can give me some (34:38 - 34:42)
advice on solo Wing yeah I knew people (34:39 - 34:43)
who were still having trouble with it by (34:42 - 34:45)
the end of the weekend so soloing is (34:44 - 34:48)
easier yeah so it seems like this is (34:45 - 34:49)
even a thing with six star raids and (34:48 - 34:51)
five star raids that soloing seems to be (34:49 - 34:54)
easier because the thing in Solo is if (34:51 - 34:58)
your NPCs die uh faint sorry if they (34:54 - 35:00)
faint there is no penalty there is no (34:58 - 35:03)
three minute penalty (35:00 - 35:07)
so a lot of solo players would use like (35:03 - 35:10)
a flutter Mane or a zoomerul and they (35:07 - 35:11)
would (35:10 - 35:13)
um they would like a flutter main would (35:11 - 35:15)
would call mine or fake tears I can't (35:13 - 35:16)
remember which one it gets and then do (35:15 - 35:18)
that a couple times and then just start (35:16 - 35:20)
Moon blasting and then it doesn't matter (35:18 - 35:22)
if Charizard knocks out the other ones (35:20 - 35:26)
it's fine the computers (35:22 - 35:29)
are smarter than humans and I I because (35:26 - 35:32)
the computers will they know that the (35:29 - 35:35)
cheer button exists where uh where like (35:32 - 35:37)
there are just there are just human (35:35 - 35:40)
players out there that refuse to use (35:37 - 35:42)
those buttons they would rather just hit (35:40 - 35:45)
like crunch or whatever move over and (35:42 - 35:47)
over again instead of being like you (35:45 - 35:49)
realize if you like (35:47 - 35:52)
sheer attack boost and then you crunch (35:49 - 35:54)
like your second like (35:52 - 35:56)
like it's like basic math right because (35:54 - 35:59)
it doubles it so it's like crunch is 50 (35:56 - 36:00)
second crunch is a hundred third crunch (35:59 - 36:02)
is 150 for this you should have taught (36:00 - 36:04)
it in the math class and then if you if (36:02 - 36:08)
you cheer your first crunch is the 100 (36:04 - 36:12)
200 through like it just Stacks like (36:08 - 36:15)
um but the the NPCs will heal you and (36:12 - 36:18)
they will cheer uh and when they faint (36:15 - 36:20)
there's no penalty so when you weigh the (36:18 - 36:22)
two of like (36:20 - 36:25)
do you want to do you want to play with (36:22 - 36:27)
with randoms that don't know that cheer (36:25 - 36:30)
button exists and all randoms want to do (36:27 - 36:32)
is the Azuma rule Strat or do you want (36:30 - 36:33)
to play with NPCs which have a variety (36:32 - 36:35)
of Pokemon but they'll at least cheer (36:33 - 36:36)
you and then you just have to worry (36:35 - 36:38)
about your own Strat (36:36 - 36:40)
I don't know why (36:38 - 36:42)
well I do know why I just explained it (36:40 - 36:44)
because uh sometimes you know people (36:42 - 36:47)
aren't the smartest uh but soloing seems (36:44 - 36:48)
to be easier (36:47 - 36:52)
um uh in that case (36:48 - 36:52)
they're I I I've done a lot of six star (36:52 - 36:57)
raids I've done five star raids I failed (36:55 - 36:59)
I've I have failed five star raids with (36:57 - 37:00)
people I have failed six star raids with (36:59 - 37:03)
people uh it is it is frustrating (37:00 - 37:04)
um (37:03 - 37:05)
and I think part of the reason why (37:04 - 37:09)
that's frustrating is because people (37:05 - 37:11)
didn't listen to hop and sword and (37:09 - 37:13)
shield no one knows what super effective (37:11 - 37:17)
is if it says if it says that it's uh (37:13 - 37:20)
you know if we're if we're fighting a (37:17 - 37:24)
uh what's a good example if we're (37:20 - 37:26)
fighting let's just do Charizard yeah (37:24 - 37:27)
for fighting we're for fighting (37:26 - 37:30)
Charizard he's a fire flying Pokemon and (37:27 - 37:34)
it says fairy in the corner (37:30 - 37:38)
or sorry dragon in the corner uh (37:34 - 37:41)
dragons cannot hit fairy Pokemon that (37:38 - 37:45)
just it it can't also you know he's (37:41 - 37:49)
still fire flying so uh I'm gonna tell (37:45 - 37:50)
you that any grass type Pokemon aren't (37:49 - 37:52)
gonna be good because your ass is weak (37:50 - 37:55)
to both fire and flying but you also (37:52 - 37:59)
have to like it's so weird how (37:55 - 38:02)
that third type just throws people off (37:59 - 38:04)
because they're (38:02 - 38:07)
because they forget that the Pokemon (38:04 - 38:11)
still has its original like moves like (38:07 - 38:13)
yes you are a different typing so you (38:11 - 38:14)
don't know if that's what they're (38:13 - 38:16)
forgetting I think that they're (38:14 - 38:18)
forgetting that Terror type is a thing (38:16 - 38:21)
well I mean yeah I think they see the (38:18 - 38:22)
terror type they go okay you're a dragon (38:21 - 38:23)
so I'm gonna bring in something that's (38:22 - 38:25)
going to be you're using Charizard for (38:23 - 38:26)
example like yeah I'm gonna bring (38:25 - 38:28)
something that can hit Dragon really (38:26 - 38:29)
hard but (38:28 - 38:31)
you know if you have a Pokemon who if (38:29 - 38:33)
you just focus on a terror type but then (38:31 - 38:34)
you forget that it also has moves that (38:33 - 38:36)
can still counter you and you're gonna (38:34 - 38:39)
be weak against (38:36 - 38:40)
um because I forgot a few times myself I (38:39 - 38:42)
go oh yeah it's this stereotype but I'm (38:40 - 38:43)
like wait a minute I forgot you have (38:42 - 38:46)
moves that can actually counter my (38:43 - 38:48)
Pokemon and I didn't think about that (38:46 - 38:50)
the the weird thing that I I looked up (38:48 - 38:54)
after the fact is I just assumed (38:50 - 38:59)
that like all five and six star Terra (38:54 - 39:01)
Pokemon would have Terra Blast I would (38:59 - 39:03)
just assume that every because so if you (39:01 - 39:05)
don't know the five star and six star (39:03 - 39:07)
Pokemon they have six moves Charizard (39:05 - 39:10)
has um I believe eight moves they don't (39:07 - 39:12)
change by the way you can I I made a (39:10 - 39:14)
little graphic Charizard had Dragon (39:12 - 39:17)
pulse fire blast hurricane Focus blast (39:14 - 39:21)
overheat Terra Blast which would be (39:17 - 39:23)
another dragon type move sunny day and (39:21 - 39:25)
Inferno (39:23 - 39:27)
um but (39:25 - 39:30)
some Pokemon just don't have Terra Blast (39:27 - 39:34)
so I I fought like uh (39:30 - 39:36)
um it was like an electric (39:34 - 39:40)
uh like mudsdale or something and so (39:36 - 39:42)
you're like oh electric so you're you're (39:40 - 39:43)
you have ground type moves because (39:42 - 39:46)
you're mudsdale and you your electric (39:43 - 39:48)
type now so we could use ground moves (39:46 - 39:50)
against you but when you look when I (39:48 - 39:52)
looked up its moveset it never got (39:50 - 39:53)
terriblast so even though it was an (39:52 - 39:56)
electric type it didn't have any (39:53 - 39:59)
electric moves so you were still kind of (39:56 - 40:02)
safe to bring in flying you would be (39:59 - 40:03)
hesitant to bring in flying because (40:02 - 40:05)
you'd be like oh it would knock me out (40:03 - 40:07)
but because electric but you it didn't (40:05 - 40:09)
have any electric type moves even though (40:07 - 40:11)
it was electric type so (40:09 - 40:14)
it it's weird and I'm sure I mean like (40:11 - 40:16)
they picked all the move sets so (40:14 - 40:18)
they decided that some Pokemon wouldn't (40:16 - 40:19)
I don't know why they'd maybe they (40:18 - 40:21)
decided that oh giving this Pokemon (40:19 - 40:23)
terablast would be too strong or or (40:21 - 40:24)
whatnot (40:23 - 40:25)
but (40:24 - 40:27)
it throws people off (40:25 - 40:30)
I I would say that I think a lot of (40:27 - 40:32)
people came away from saying that (40:30 - 40:34)
Charizard was easier than a lot of six (40:32 - 40:36)
star raids but that's I think that's (40:34 - 40:38)
because people were planning all week (40:36 - 40:41)
for it like I I have gone up to six star (40:38 - 40:44)
raids and like gone it like click on it (40:41 - 40:47)
what is it and then I just go like (40:44 - 40:51)
oh I don't have anything for this (40:47 - 40:53)
like I I could try I could try to brute (40:51 - 40:57)
force it right or I could hope that my (40:53 - 40:58)
three other teammates bring something (40:57 - 41:00)
decent but like I think that's the (40:58 - 41:02)
problem right now in the game and this (41:00 - 41:05)
is kind of why I'm so sick of seeing a (41:02 - 41:07)
Zuma roll or iron hands (41:05 - 41:09)
is because (41:07 - 41:11)
people built (41:09 - 41:14)
Pokemon for Charizard (41:11 - 41:18)
and that is what they have now that that (41:14 - 41:20)
that's that's what they built and so now (41:18 - 41:21)
that Charizard is over they just go well (41:20 - 41:23)
this is my level 100 it worked for (41:21 - 41:25)
Charizard I'm gonna bring it to no do (41:23 - 41:27)
not bring your Azuma roll to this (41:25 - 41:29)
electric tarot type raid because I can (41:27 - 41:31)
tell you that this Pokemon has an (41:29 - 41:33)
electric type move like don't do that (41:31 - 41:35)
but that's you're only 100 so and the (41:33 - 41:38)
thing too is I'm trying to think and I'm (41:35 - 41:38)
actually probably gonna make a YouTube (41:38 - 41:41)
video about this of like (41:38 - 41:44)
what do you even build like what what (41:41 - 41:46)
what what what would be six Pokemon that (41:44 - 41:49)
you could feel confident about putting (41:46 - 41:55)
EVs and uh IVs and rare candy into that (41:49 - 41:57)
if you approach a six star raid and (41:55 - 41:58)
there's one every single day assuming (41:57 - 41:59)
you beat your game (41:58 - 42:01)
can one of these six Pokemon work (41:59 - 42:03)
because I'm going to tell you right now (42:01 - 42:04)
Azuma world does not work for every (42:03 - 42:06)
single ride uh iron hands does not work (42:04 - 42:09)
for every single raid and again maybe (42:06 - 42:11)
you can be lucky and you can brute force (42:09 - 42:12)
it maybe the computer missed you twice (42:11 - 42:14)
you were able to get your belly drum off (42:12 - 42:18)
and and do it sure like RNG is a (42:14 - 42:20)
definitely a thing in Pokemon no one no (42:18 - 42:22)
one's debating that (42:20 - 42:26)
um but even even there I I think I'm (42:22 - 42:28)
like my number one choice I can already (42:26 - 42:29)
tell you what the YouTube video would be (42:28 - 42:30)
my number one choice would a million (42:29 - 42:33)
percent become snarl uh because Grim (42:30 - 42:35)
style has amazing typing uh it's only (42:33 - 42:36)
weak to poison there's not a lot of (42:35 - 42:38)
poison Pokemon out there it is weak to (42:36 - 42:41)
fairy uh but you can still survive with (42:38 - 42:43)
screens and then it's like weak to steal (42:41 - 42:45)
and again that's like three types that (42:43 - 42:48)
it it's that you might have problems (42:45 - 42:49)
with (42:48 - 42:50)
um but other Pokemon can take care of (42:49 - 42:52)
that Grim style Works in like every (42:50 - 42:54)
single raid it's my number one here for (42:52 - 42:58)
Charizard and I just recommend like uh (42:54 - 42:59)
light screen because you don't need to (42:58 - 43:01)
reflect because Charizard doesn't have a (42:59 - 43:04)
single physical move Spirit Break uh (43:01 - 43:06)
which does fairy damage which is super (43:04 - 43:08)
effective against Dragon but it also (43:06 - 43:10)
lowers Charizard's Special Attack by One (43:08 - 43:12)
Stage every time you do it thunder wave (43:10 - 43:13)
in case you just want to paralyze (43:12 - 43:14)
Charizard to slow it down at the (43:13 - 43:15)
beginning or (43:14 - 43:17)
I always Thunder waved after Shield (43:15 - 43:21)
broke because I never trust the HP bar (43:17 - 43:24)
um and then fake tears so if you have (43:21 - 43:26)
Sylveon sitting next to you or you have (43:24 - 43:29)
uh flutter Mane sitting next to you like (43:26 - 43:30)
spamming fake tears before the shield (43:29 - 43:32)
goes up you're just going to do major (43:30 - 43:33)
damage (43:32 - 43:36)
if I gave Grim snarl (43:33 - 43:37)
to a person that didn't understand (43:36 - 43:39)
competitive or didn't understand (43:37 - 43:41)
teamwork and they just smashed Spirit (43:39 - 43:44)
Break which I said earlier how I just (43:41 - 43:45)
watched people smash like crunch or (43:44 - 43:47)
whatever move they had they would still (43:45 - 43:49)
be doing more (43:47 - 43:51)
than than most players because even (43:49 - 43:52)
though they're barely doing any damage (43:51 - 43:54)
they're at least lowering Charizard (43:52 - 43:56)
special attack every single time they (43:54 - 43:59)
Spirit Break which is like huge (43:56 - 44:03)
um in this uh so and then Grim style you (43:59 - 44:05)
could just light screen reflect (44:03 - 44:07)
whichever one you need ideally you would (44:05 - 44:08)
probably build two Grim Styles you would (44:07 - 44:10)
you would build a competit you would (44:08 - 44:11)
build a special grim star on the (44:10 - 44:14)
physical Grim snarl but grim star but (44:11 - 44:16)
you can go in and what what I've been (44:14 - 44:17)
doing is just (44:16 - 44:20)
once it once it knows a move in this (44:17 - 44:22)
game you can change it for free and you (44:20 - 44:23)
can change it right before you go into (44:22 - 44:24)
the raid whether it needs reflect or (44:23 - 44:26)
light screen (44:24 - 44:27)
um (44:26 - 44:31)
uh here here's the thing though about (44:27 - 44:33)
rating (44:31 - 44:35)
no people don't know how to do it and (44:33 - 44:36)
that's fine that's no one's fault the (44:35 - 44:38)
game doesn't like really teach you this (44:36 - 44:39)
as somebody who played a lot of like (44:38 - 44:43)
Final Fantasy 14 or destiny uh or (44:39 - 44:46)
destiny 2 or whatever other amount of (44:43 - 44:49)
games that require actual group teamwork (44:46 - 44:52)
I think the problem that I have with (44:49 - 44:55)
um like Azuma role players or iron hand (44:52 - 44:57)
players is I feel like nine times out of (44:55 - 45:00)
ten they're actually not team players (44:57 - 45:02)
they they they have built a Pokemon (45:00 - 45:04)
because a YouTube video or a YouTube (45:02 - 45:07)
content creator told them to now that's (45:04 - 45:10)
not to say that those Pokemon don't work (45:07 - 45:12)
clearly they do a lot of people have (45:10 - 45:15)
clears with the Zoomer roll in our hands (45:12 - 45:17)
um here's the thing though I I made this (45:15 - 45:20)
graphic right I'll probably make some (45:17 - 45:21)
tweaks to it and republish it again (45:20 - 45:23)
because like people found it very (45:21 - 45:26)
helpful of like what should I build and (45:23 - 45:28)
Twitter is a funny place because I feel (45:26 - 45:29)
like I could tweet (45:28 - 45:31)
I love (45:29 - 45:35)
uh waffles right I could tweet that I (45:31 - 45:37)
love waffles on Twitter and then the (45:35 - 45:40)
comments would be like why do you hate (45:37 - 45:43)
pancakes and it's like you never said (45:40 - 45:45)
that I just said I liked waffles why are (45:43 - 45:47)
you so I make this I made this graphic (45:45 - 45:49)
and then everyone's like where is (45:47 - 45:52)
flutter Maine and uh I never said (45:49 - 45:54)
flutter maidens and roll are bad I just (45:52 - 45:56)
don't think (45:54 - 46:00)
recommending a zoomeral over the three (45:56 - 46:02)
Pokemon I did is a good option because (46:00 - 46:05)
one if you're if you're complaining (46:02 - 46:06)
about where is the zoomerul it's (46:05 - 46:07)
probably because you watched a YouTube (46:06 - 46:10)
video telling you how to do it and it (46:07 - 46:12)
probably explained that how to do it two (46:10 - 46:15)
I in a graphic I can't (46:12 - 46:19)
convey the belly Strat the belly drum (46:15 - 46:20)
strategy as well right going back to the (46:19 - 46:23)
Grim style example if you don't (46:20 - 46:25)
understand what light screen does or (46:23 - 46:28)
fake tears and you just want to be the I (46:25 - 46:30)
just want to do damage you you you you (46:28 - 46:33)
did it cool you can just Spam Spirit (46:30 - 46:35)
Break and you're still being a huge help (46:33 - 46:37)
if you don't hit that belly drum button (46:35 - 46:39)
with a zoomerul or you hit at the wrong (46:37 - 46:42)
time you are actively hurting your team (46:39 - 46:45)
like you're you're not helping in any (46:42 - 46:47)
way you're just dying you're just being (46:45 - 46:49)
a liability and to be honest if you're (46:47 - 46:53)
looking for a guide on how to do this (46:49 - 46:55)
and I've done I've (46:53 - 46:57)
I've played a lot of Destiny a lot of (46:55 - 47:01)
Destiny and I don't know how my wife (46:57 - 47:03)
found these people (47:01 - 47:06)
but every single day because I I had a (47:03 - 47:08)
nine to five job get home play Destiny (47:06 - 47:09)
with her every night every day she'd be (47:08 - 47:11)
like I found this person they're really (47:09 - 47:12)
great they've never done a raid can you (47:11 - 47:14)
help them can we can we go through this (47:12 - 47:15)
rates can we go through Kings fall (47:14 - 47:17)
together King's fall is like a two-hour (47:15 - 47:20)
raid and you only get rewards one one (47:17 - 47:22)
time a week I had three characters I (47:20 - 47:24)
played a lot of Destiny so technically I (47:22 - 47:25)
could get rewards three times a week by (47:24 - 47:27)
switching characters but every single (47:25 - 47:29)
day Irene would be like this person has (47:27 - 47:31)
never done a raid can you help them can (47:29 - 47:33)
we can we carry them through this raid (47:31 - 47:36)
it's like okay well that's three me you (47:33 - 47:38)
this new person you just found who's (47:36 - 47:40)
never done a raid before okay we gotta (47:38 - 47:41)
find three more people that are like (47:40 - 47:43)
willing to do this and we would run (47:41 - 47:45)
these people through a two-hour King's (47:43 - 47:46)
fall raid (47:45 - 47:49)
and they made mistakes right and the (47:46 - 47:50)
thing I learned (47:49 - 47:53)
through rating and destiny is that (47:50 - 47:57)
people didn't want to do raids because (47:53 - 48:00)
they didn't want to be the weakest link (47:57 - 48:04)
uh that was 100 show that was a (48:00 - 48:06)
fantastic I'm giving you plus 10 points (48:04 - 48:08)
on your scorecards dude for that so well (48:06 - 48:10)
done congratulations thank you thank you (48:08 - 48:12)
good fantastic game show they didn't (48:10 - 48:15)
want to be the weakest link (48:12 - 48:17)
um and so they just would rather not do (48:15 - 48:20)
some of the best content in Destiny (48:17 - 48:22)
because they didn't want anyone to be (48:20 - 48:24)
mad at them they didn't want to bring (48:22 - 48:26)
down the team and it was very the thing (48:24 - 48:28)
in Destiny is (48:26 - 48:32)
can can you can you carry yeah sure five (48:28 - 48:35)
people can make up for one person this (48:32 - 48:36)
can happen in Pokemon two I've seen it (48:35 - 48:38)
happen I've seen three level 100s carry (48:36 - 48:40)
a level 60 through Charizard it's (48:38 - 48:42)
possible (48:40 - 48:45)
um again RNG exists in all these games (48:42 - 48:46)
but (48:45 - 48:49)
I'm never going to recommend (48:46 - 48:52)
in my Graphics or my advice a Pokemon (48:49 - 48:54)
that would just (48:52 - 48:57)
uh what's the word that would that could (48:54 - 49:00)
potentially make you a liability (48:57 - 49:03)
like I cannot I cannot confidently (49:00 - 49:06)
recommend a zoom roll and be like okay (49:03 - 49:08)
you had no clue what to build you're (49:06 - 49:11)
looking at this now build this Pokemon (49:08 - 49:15)
that cuts its Health in half and hope (49:11 - 49:17)
that your other three teammates don't (49:15 - 49:20)
heal you or or heal you hope that they (49:17 - 49:21)
put up a screen hope they do something (49:20 - 49:26)
to give you your next turn to attack now (49:21 - 49:27)
if you're running shell Bell and you're (49:26 - 49:28)
attacking you're getting your health (49:27 - 49:30)
back right if you're running iron hands (49:28 - 49:31)
you might drain punch to get your health (49:30 - 49:34)
back but that's assuming that the RNG (49:31 - 49:36)
isn't focusing on you to take you out (49:34 - 49:38)
that's assuming you're you don't miss (49:36 - 49:40)
your play rough that's assuming that (49:38 - 49:42)
like you you didn't get paralyzed you (49:40 - 49:43)
didn't get confused there's so many (49:42 - 49:45)
things that can happen and the first (49:43 - 49:47)
thing you want to tell a brand new (49:45 - 49:49)
player to do is cut your health in half (49:47 - 49:51)
against this incredibly powerful raid I (49:49 - 49:54)
can't safely recommend it I the the ones (49:51 - 49:56)
I the ones I recommended for Charizard (49:54 - 49:58)
was Grim sorrow Dodge bun and Sylveon (49:56 - 50:02)
Grim Style just cannot die if you just (49:58 - 50:04)
hit the light screen button you like (50:02 - 50:07)
eventually yes he could die but like you (50:04 - 50:08)
have once you hit that (50:07 - 50:12)
your your rock solid and so is the rest (50:08 - 50:14)
of your team you're you've already done (50:12 - 50:16)
so much uh By hitting that light screen (50:14 - 50:20)
button dash button can literally only be (50:16 - 50:23)
hit by Hurricane and focus blast and (50:20 - 50:25)
that's a and a hurricane is like 75 (50:23 - 50:28)
accurate and 50 accurate once sun goes (50:25 - 50:31)
up like it cannot be hit by fire type (50:28 - 50:32)
moves he cannot be hit by dragging type (50:31 - 50:35)
moves again does he hit super hard no (50:32 - 50:38)
but you can helping hand you can you can (50:35 - 50:40)
load you can lower a Charizard special (50:38 - 50:42)
attack which is great for your team you (50:40 - 50:43)
can at least hit the play rough button (50:42 - 50:47)
Sylveon is a special tank even if it was (50:43 - 50:50)
hitting by hitting getting hit by fire (50:47 - 50:51)
type moves you're still gonna you're (50:50 - 50:54)
still gonna eat all of those up so and (50:51 - 50:55)
if for whatever reason there's not a (50:54 - 50:57)
grim star on your team Sylveon has (50:55 - 51:00)
access to light screen like these three (50:57 - 51:04)
Pokemon where I picked specifically to (51:00 - 51:06)
make those people that feel like they're (51:04 - 51:09)
a liability more comfortable going into (51:06 - 51:11)
a raid because that that is what people (51:09 - 51:13)
are overlooking is like just use a (51:11 - 51:16)
zoomeral yeah yeah if you are like like (51:13 - 51:18)
the amount of a zoomeros I I watched use (51:16 - 51:21)
belly drum do a bunch of damage die (51:18 - 51:24)
which is for the most part okay and then (51:21 - 51:27)
come back to life they have to hit belly (51:24 - 51:30)
drum again right and they come back to (51:27 - 51:32)
life they hit belly drum and Charizard (51:30 - 51:36)
goes time to reset all stats (51:32 - 51:36)
you know he was going to reset the stats (51:36 - 51:43)
you knew he was going to do this why did (51:40 - 51:45)
you hit belly drum right away like like (51:43 - 51:48)
what wait until he reset stats and then (51:45 - 51:51)
hit the belly drum but now you've cut (51:48 - 51:54)
your life in half he's reset stats you (51:51 - 51:57)
are now a giant Easter egg paperweight (51:54 - 52:00)
because you're not plus six and you have (51:57 - 52:02)
half health so now the rest of the team (52:00 - 52:06)
has to heal and pick up the slack again (52:02 - 52:08)
with the three Pokemon I picked (52:06 - 52:10)
at no point are you ever a paperweight (52:08 - 52:14)
you're you're completely helpful and (52:10 - 52:16)
beneficial to everyone on the team and I (52:14 - 52:18)
think that's the feeling you are trying (52:16 - 52:20)
to get across like in your graphic and (52:18 - 52:22)
your communication is that you want to (52:20 - 52:24)
feel good going into these raids and if (52:22 - 52:26)
you can defeat a raid and say hey I (52:24 - 52:29)
actually protected our team I put up (52:26 - 52:31)
that light screen I gave you that (52:29 - 52:34)
helping hand you may not be the the (52:31 - 52:37)
hardest hitting Pokemon you may not be (52:34 - 52:39)
dealing like a ton of damage but if you (52:37 - 52:41)
can support the other team members like (52:39 - 52:43)
um I know when I was playing Grim snall (52:41 - 52:45)
yes I set up live screen I do fake tears (52:43 - 52:47)
I use a term like hey I'm gonna use a (52:45 - 52:49)
cheer I'm gonna you know boost up I'm (52:47 - 52:51)
gonna heal everybody up first or I'm (52:49 - 52:53)
gonna boost your defenses it makes you (52:51 - 52:55)
feel so much better going into these (52:53 - 52:57)
raids knowing you played a really (52:55 - 52:59)
important part in helping everybody else (52:57 - 53:02)
survive limited damage give them the (52:59 - 53:04)
Boost they need (53:02 - 53:06)
and listen if you want to bring a Zoomer (53:04 - 53:07)
like if you can do the you're the (53:06 - 53:09)
greatest Zoom World player in the world (53:07 - 53:11)
and you know how to do the belly drum (53:09 - 53:15)
strap perfectly at what time listen do (53:11 - 53:16)
it (53:15 - 53:20)
Siri be quiet do it (53:16 - 53:22)
Sarah's saying don't use nothing Morel (53:20 - 53:25)
listen play you know the beauty about (53:22 - 53:27)
life is you have free choice if you (53:25 - 53:28)
don't go and play Zoom world you play (53:27 - 53:30)
Zoom world you're just gonna have not a (53:28 - 53:34)
good time but I feel like using having a (53:30 - 53:36)
much more accessible pool of Pokemon (53:34 - 53:38)
that you can bring into these battles (53:36 - 53:41)
and actually have an impact on it I (53:38 - 53:43)
think it's what is the beauty of you (53:41 - 53:44)
know some of these builds that we have (53:43 - 53:46)
out there and it's more variety honestly (53:44 - 53:48)
I was gonna bring it back around I think (53:46 - 53:50)
this is the year of gold Dango I didn't (53:48 - 53:52)
go Dango I think go Tango is still a (53:50 - 53:56)
pretty solid uh Ray choice because you (53:52 - 53:58)
have good as gold as as an ability you (53:56 - 54:00)
can learn things like nasty plot you can (53:58 - 54:03)
do metal sound a little to lower the the (54:00 - 54:05)
special defenses and then you can just (54:03 - 54:06)
do something like you know Shadow Ball (54:05 - 54:08)
to just you know blast them so there are (54:06 - 54:10)
other Pokemon out there (54:08 - 54:13)
uh that Grim snorkel dangle I think of (54:10 - 54:16)
the Florida Main also are great for just (54:13 - 54:19)
overall five and six star raids but I (54:16 - 54:20)
feel like (54:19 - 54:23)
first of all I like waffles Steve I (54:20 - 54:24)
think waffles are good okay all right (54:23 - 54:27)
good to know good to know um it goes (54:24 - 54:29)
back to the um to a a comedian uh Mitch (54:27 - 54:33)
Hedrick saying aren't um the waffles are (54:29 - 54:36)
just pancakes with syrup traps that's (54:33 - 54:38)
that's all it is just little little (54:36 - 54:40)
pockets of Sarah traps uh but yeah I (54:38 - 54:41)
agree with you on that I like waffles (54:40 - 54:44)
too but no I think um I think what we're (54:41 - 54:46)
trying to say here is (54:44 - 54:49)
after a few days of all these Tick Tock (54:46 - 54:50)
videos and all these YouTube videos (54:49 - 54:53)
hitting your feed saying oh you have to (54:50 - 54:54)
use your resources to build a Zoomer (54:53 - 54:56)
rail you have to build it this way have (54:54 - 54:58)
this EV Strat and then all of a sudden (54:56 - 55:01)
you realize this is not how it really is (54:58 - 55:03)
and I don't want to make sure like (55:01 - 55:04)
you're wasting your time building a (55:03 - 55:06)
Pokemon that's just going to be (55:04 - 55:08)
one-shotted every single time and you (55:06 - 55:10)
don't know a real a good Strat with it I (55:08 - 55:12)
think having this accessible pool of (55:10 - 55:14)
Pokemon saying if you know you're gonna (55:12 - 55:16)
raid with people you could do a solo (55:14 - 55:17)
like to your point I find out that solo (55:16 - 55:19)
is much easier now because I just (55:17 - 55:21)
realized when I did solo I don't have (55:19 - 55:23)
that delay in the uh commands being hit (55:21 - 55:25)
at one time because I'm the only one (55:23 - 55:28)
that matters and all my NPCs are saying (55:25 - 55:30)
yeah let's cheer you up Bob or yeah (55:28 - 55:32)
let's raise your defenses it's great (55:30 - 55:35)
um I know I think I think seeing is that (55:32 - 55:36)
this is the second time this is coming (55:35 - 55:37)
around (55:36 - 55:40)
give another Pokemon a shot give it you (55:37 - 55:43)
know give doc spawn a try give Sylveon a (55:40 - 55:45)
try give Grim snall a try this is a (55:43 - 55:48)
great way to expand your knowledge of (55:45 - 55:50)
different Pokemon builds out there and (55:48 - 55:52)
different strategies this is a great (55:50 - 55:54)
time to do something different and I (55:52 - 55:55)
don't know it isn't a follow-up question (55:54 - 55:57)
for both of you do you know if we can (55:55 - 56:00)
catch another Charizard in this event or (55:57 - 56:02)
is it like a part two of the original (56:00 - 56:04)
event that you can't catch more than one (56:02 - 56:06)
I don't know if that's I think it's just (56:04 - 56:09)
one it's just one okay okay yeah (56:06 - 56:11)
um but still I think this is a great (56:09 - 56:12)
opportunity just to try something (56:11 - 56:13)
different just don't stick with the same (56:12 - 56:16)
strategy even it's a if it's a bad (56:13 - 56:18)
strategy just try something new give it (56:16 - 56:19)
a shot that's the beauty of Pokemon uh (56:18 - 56:21)
give it give it a chance (56:19 - 56:24)
yeah like like I said the zoomeral thing (56:21 - 56:26)
works if you if you if you know how to (56:24 - 56:29)
time your belly drums you're fine uh and (56:26 - 56:31)
and if there's a grim style standing (56:29 - 56:33)
next to your you you're even more fine (56:31 - 56:35)
right like if I if I wasn't a zoom of a (56:33 - 56:36)
player and I saw a grim star I'd be like (56:35 - 56:39)
great their screens are gonna go up I'm (56:36 - 56:40)
gonna be able to cut my health in half (56:39 - 56:43)
I'm gonna be able to survive right uh I (56:40 - 56:45)
have heard so many stories in the past (56:43 - 56:50)
two weeks well one it went for it I went (56:45 - 56:51)
on the ride I went on the ride to people (56:50 - 56:53)
being like should I bring a zoomeral (56:51 - 56:55)
everyone's bringing a zoomeral why (56:53 - 56:56)
aren't you why aren't you playing a (56:55 - 56:58)
zoomero too a couple days later being (56:56 - 57:01)
like man I cannot stand a zoomeral guess (56:58 - 57:04)
why we failed this raid a zoom Earl like (57:01 - 57:05)
yep (57:04 - 57:08)
I mean as I all plays (57:05 - 57:11)
because Emerald plays on that core water (57:08 - 57:15)
fire grass type advantage triangle that (57:11 - 57:18)
everybody knows it plays on the one type (57:15 - 57:20)
advantage triangle that everybody knows (57:18 - 57:23)
because of the starters and so even it's (57:20 - 57:25)
it is taking advantage of that along (57:23 - 57:27)
with people who don't understand Terror (57:25 - 57:30)
types and so when you see this azumerel (57:27 - 57:33)
is clearly water it's blue and this (57:30 - 57:35)
Charizard has fire on it I'm gonna go (57:33 - 57:38)
with the azumer yeah I mean it has it (57:35 - 57:40)
does have perfect typing for Charizard (57:38 - 57:42)
that's why it works uh yes I mean but (57:40 - 57:44)
that's that's one of the main reasons (57:42 - 57:46)
that I think that it's probably the (57:44 - 57:49)
instinctive I'm gonna go with this when (57:46 - 57:51)
just looking at the lineup for people (57:49 - 57:53)
who don't understand type matchups quite (57:51 - 57:56)
as well yeah I was I was gonna say I've (57:53 - 57:58)
heard horror stories of of four Azuma (57:56 - 58:00)
rules and they all belly drum and then (57:58 - 58:02)
one by one they get taken out because no (58:00 - 58:06)
one is no one is healing and no one is (58:02 - 58:07)
is is putting up Shields or anything (58:06 - 58:09)
right and like like I said if you if you (58:07 - 58:11)
belly drum and you miss your play rough (58:09 - 58:13)
and you get knocked out because no one's (58:11 - 58:16)
healed you or there's no there's no (58:13 - 58:17)
screens (58:16 - 58:19)
well now you're now you're just playing (58:17 - 58:21)
ketchup whereas like (58:19 - 58:26)
if if one or two of those azumerels just (58:21 - 58:28)
hit the cheer button instead of hitting (58:26 - 58:29)
the belly drum button (58:28 - 58:32)
you would have you would have helped out (58:29 - 58:34)
yeah this goes this goes back to Destiny (58:32 - 58:38)
right if if I'm so Destiny raids are (58:34 - 58:40)
designed in a way to separate players (58:38 - 58:43)
out so somebody can't do everything (58:40 - 58:44)
right that's the whole point of a raid (58:43 - 58:47)
is like do do what you're doing and I'm (58:44 - 58:49)
gonna do what I'm doing we gotta trust (58:47 - 58:51)
that we're doing what each other we're (58:49 - 58:54)
we're we're we're working together right (58:51 - 58:56)
so if I'm in if I'm in the Vault of (58:54 - 58:59)
Glass and there's a part in the Vault of (58:56 - 59:01)
Glass where there's three lanes there's (58:59 - 59:03)
the center lane left lane right lane and (59:01 - 59:06)
I would always take new people to the (59:03 - 59:08)
left lane because I thought the left (59:06 - 59:11)
lane was harder and I was like I can I (59:08 - 59:12)
can carry this person the left-hand lane (59:11 - 59:15)
and then I would put the other strong (59:12 - 59:17)
player so not Irene I would put the (59:15 - 59:20)
other strong player on the right lane (59:17 - 59:21)
and then I would put Irene in the middle (59:20 - 59:24)
so we have the two strong players on the (59:21 - 59:26)
outside and they're they're usually with (59:24 - 59:28)
the two weakest players and then we have (59:26 - 59:31)
the two like mediocre average players at (59:28 - 59:32)
least the players that know what's (59:31 - 59:34)
happening right in the middle and that (59:32 - 59:37)
way as somebody on the left hand side I (59:34 - 59:40)
can take care of my Lane babysit my new (59:37 - 59:42)
person and then look over in the center (59:40 - 59:44)
and be like I can help center out too I (59:42 - 59:46)
cannot help out the right hand side (59:44 - 59:48)
though like if I was to leave my Lane (59:46 - 59:52)
and go help the right side my Lane fails (59:48 - 59:56)
um and this is is this is just something (59:52 - 59:58)
that happens in raids right I have to (59:56 - 60:00)
trust that the right hand side is doing (59:58 - 60:02)
everything they're doing right and I (60:00 - 60:03)
just have to trust it and I have to stay (60:02 - 60:05)
in my Lane because I can't move between (60:03 - 60:07)
all the lanes and be like I'm the best (60:05 - 60:08)
player I'm gonna carry this is the same (60:07 - 60:10)
thing this is the mentality that like a (60:08 - 60:13)
Zoomer or iron hand players have to get (60:10 - 60:17)
out of like you cannot belly drum (60:13 - 60:19)
and heal yourself (60:17 - 60:21)
and do damage you just can't do all (60:19 - 60:24)
three you're you're literally wasting (60:21 - 60:25)
time by belly drumming and this this (60:24 - 60:27)
doesn't specifically go for those (60:25 - 60:29)
players right like like if you're a (60:27 - 60:31)
flutter main player and somebody was (60:29 - 60:33)
like oh you just you just bring flutter (60:31 - 60:35)
Maine you just like you just fake tears (60:33 - 60:37)
two times and then you heal yourself and (60:35 - 60:40)
then you start doing damage no like (60:37 - 60:42)
maybe if you're in Solo sure but like if (60:40 - 60:44)
you're a flutter Maine player (60:42 - 60:46)
your job is to do as much damage as (60:44 - 60:50)
possible you need to trust that your (60:46 - 60:52)
teammates are going to do the other (60:50 - 60:54)
things and heal you because if you're (60:52 - 60:56)
supposed to be doing the most damage (60:54 - 60:59)
especially as a Zoomer player or an iron (60:56 - 61:01)
hands player you need to trust that (60:59 - 61:02)
somebody else is going to heal you (61:01 - 61:04)
we've learned this past week that (61:02 - 61:05)
azumero players don't want to do that (61:04 - 61:07)
they don't they want to just do my Max (61:05 - 61:10)
damage and there's there's no trust (61:07 - 61:11)
there (61:10 - 61:13)
um and that's why I think that Grim (61:11 - 61:16)
snarl is a really good play for a lot of (61:13 - 61:18)
people because like in most of these (61:16 - 61:21)
Charizard raids I barely attacked even (61:18 - 61:22)
though I have an attack right I'm (61:21 - 61:24)
setting up light screen if I have (61:22 - 61:25)
special attackers near me I'm going to (61:24 - 61:27)
fake tears if I have physical attackers (61:25 - 61:29)
near me I'm going to Thunder Wave by the (61:27 - 61:31)
time I light screen Thunder Wave I'm now (61:29 - 61:33)
doing my first heal (61:31 - 61:35)
um I'm probably gonna do maybe another (61:33 - 61:37)
heel at that point Charizard is going to (61:35 - 61:40)
reset stats at that point I'm probably (61:37 - 61:43)
going to cheer to get a attack boost and (61:40 - 61:45)
then I'm gonna start Spirit breaking (61:43 - 61:48)
like right like at that point (61:45 - 61:51)
ideally you should be on track to win (61:48 - 61:53)
and then you can you can feel safe (61:51 - 61:55)
enough to do that like (61:53 - 61:57)
I have so much to do that I can't even (61:55 - 61:59)
attack so I can't imagine you know if (61:57 - 62:01)
you're a flutter main player or an azumo (61:59 - 62:04)
player you got to do your your status (62:01 - 62:06)
move your Swords Dance or your fake (62:04 - 62:08)
tears or your belly drum and then you (62:06 - 62:10)
got you got you I got time you ain't got (62:08 - 62:13)
time to heal you shouldn't be healing if (62:10 - 62:14)
you're trying to do all of that you're (62:13 - 62:16)
not helping the team (62:14 - 62:20)
um but this is just like fundamentals of (62:16 - 62:22)
rating and I think it's why I think (62:20 - 62:23)
there's two reason why why people are (62:22 - 62:25)
getting so frustrated with six stars (62:23 - 62:28)
number one is people just don't (62:25 - 62:30)
understand the Dynamics of we all can (62:28 - 62:33)
attack here some somebody needs to do (62:30 - 62:35)
some sort of support and that's why (62:33 - 62:37)
again I'm going back to Grim snarl as if (62:35 - 62:39)
you're struggling with six star raids (62:37 - 62:41)
you might have to be that support you (62:39 - 62:43)
might have to yeah be that support and (62:41 - 62:46)
number two with the six star raids why (62:43 - 62:48)
people I think are getting frustrated is (62:46 - 62:50)
because no one knows what to bring in (62:48 - 62:53)
the sense of like (62:50 - 62:56)
I I and I struggle with this too is what (62:53 - 62:59)
are like six Pokemon that I can have at (62:56 - 63:02)
level 100 with pretty decent move sets (62:59 - 63:04)
that I can I can just pick before a raid (63:02 - 63:08)
because one because azumero Grim snarl (63:04 - 63:09)
Charizard all these Pokemon they just (63:08 - 63:13)
cannot do every six star raid (63:09 - 63:16)
and I don't want to like I could I (63:13 - 63:19)
imagine like a a player who who only has (63:16 - 63:21)
like two level 100 Pokemon at this point (63:19 - 63:22)
because the game is so new to be like (63:21 - 63:27)
well do I put all of my candy into iron (63:22 - 63:30)
Thorns is and then I've find out that (63:27 - 63:32)
iron Thorns is bad and be like well I I (63:30 - 63:35)
don't have the candy now and so that's (63:32 - 63:37)
why I want to make a list of like six (63:35 - 63:40)
Pokemon that will help throughout all (63:37 - 63:41)
raids (63:40 - 63:43)
um that you could be like okay uh one of (63:41 - 63:45)
these six fits this bill and I feel (63:43 - 63:46)
confident about it and maybe I have to (63:45 - 63:48)
change one move but at least you know (63:46 - 63:49)
I'm not bringing (63:48 - 63:52)
iron hands to every single raid whether (63:49 - 63:55)
it works or doesn't work listen the (63:52 - 63:57)
amount of people I've seen bringing (63:55 - 64:00)
freaking iron hands to ghost Tara raids (63:57 - 64:04)
I'm like oh because I I did die a little (64:00 - 64:06)
inside but I can't punch that you can't (64:04 - 64:09)
try and punch that so you you do belly (64:06 - 64:11)
drum and you realize okay so now what do (64:09 - 64:12)
I do (64:11 - 64:15)
um but I think I think to your point (64:12 - 64:17)
Steve I think if you have a solid team (64:15 - 64:21)
that can play offense and then play (64:17 - 64:22)
support (64:21 - 64:24)
you really should be prepared to go into (64:22 - 64:26)
any raid to play a certain role if (64:24 - 64:28)
you're soloing that's fine you can you (64:26 - 64:29)
know have fun soloing but if you're with (64:28 - 64:31)
a group of people (64:29 - 64:34)
online I think having a solid set of (64:31 - 64:37)
Pokemon that could either hit hard or to (64:34 - 64:39)
your point play defense and I still (64:37 - 64:40)
think grip stall is a solid choice (64:39 - 64:43)
because it can do all that you can go (64:40 - 64:44)
into array you go okay I'm gonna be (64:43 - 64:46)
playing support I'm gonna be helping (64:44 - 64:48)
I'll be helping Hannah out and Hannah's (64:46 - 64:50)
going to be a big attacker because she (64:48 - 64:52)
has a Sylveon or (64:50 - 64:54)
um I can say hey I can do the spirit (64:52 - 64:56)
break I can still play some type of you (64:54 - 64:58)
know help like offense a defensive (64:56 - 65:00)
support role but I can start hitting if (64:58 - 65:03)
I need to uh and don't forget you have (65:00 - 65:05)
cheers I think the amount of people I (65:03 - 65:08)
see not using cheers oh my gosh with my (65:05 - 65:12)
mind again this goes back to like (65:08 - 65:14)
I think in these higher end raids like (65:12 - 65:17)
uh like uh I think mimiku is a really uh (65:14 - 65:21)
uh good oh Choice absolutely solid and (65:17 - 65:23)
what's what's actually the thing as I'm (65:21 - 65:25)
working on this this video to release is (65:23 - 65:26)
like (65:25 - 65:28)
I I feel like I have to exclude Pokemon (65:26 - 65:30)
just because they're fairy type it is (65:28 - 65:33)
unreal how many of like Grim snarl (65:30 - 65:38)
dashbun Sylveon mimikyu flutter Maine (65:33 - 65:41)
that's why fairy type pokemon and if I'm (65:38 - 65:42)
if I'm trying to make a list of six (65:41 - 65:45)
Pokemon that you should bring to that (65:42 - 65:46)
that you you should feel confident about (65:45 - 65:48)
putting your candy into I don't think I (65:46 - 65:50)
should make a list with five fairy type (65:48 - 65:52)
pokemon I mean like fairy is incredibly (65:50 - 65:54)
good I I feel like I talked about this (65:52 - 65:55)
through all sword and shields that's why (65:54 - 65:56)
zashian was number one on the ladder (65:55 - 66:00)
fairy is just such an uh an offensive (65:56 - 66:03)
great type and then steel is a great (66:00 - 66:07)
defensive type yeah but like if you're (66:03 - 66:09)
if your main job is attacking it's why (66:07 - 66:12)
belly drum is is so sought after right (66:09 - 66:15)
now uh gives you plus six if you're (66:12 - 66:17)
bringing mimikyu like you should (66:15 - 66:18)
probably be swords dancing if you're (66:17 - 66:19)
bringing flutter main you should (66:18 - 66:22)
probably be fake tiering like you should (66:19 - 66:25)
be doing some sort of status whether (66:22 - 66:27)
that's to boost your own stats or not (66:25 - 66:30)
your stats like a great combination I (66:27 - 66:32)
saw was was three dash buns and a grim (66:30 - 66:35)
snarl I was the Grim snarl spoiler (66:32 - 66:37)
um but dashbun is a physical attacker (66:35 - 66:41)
and if you have howl it boosts (66:37 - 66:43)
everyone's physical attack because (66:41 - 66:45)
you're howling and I saw three dash buns (66:43 - 66:48)
all how and I set up the light screen (66:45 - 66:51)
and then all of a sudden we we who let (66:48 - 66:53)
the dogs out they were they were going (66:51 - 66:57)
wild like three three dash buns all (66:53 - 66:59)
howling at the same time just the first (66:57 - 67:01)
turn just howling (66:59 - 67:03)
and that's now each dashboard has a plus (67:01 - 67:06)
three that's so much better like like if (67:03 - 67:08)
you think about like well just bring a (67:06 - 67:10)
zoomeral like think about what what just (67:08 - 67:12)
happened there like instead of everyone (67:10 - 67:14)
cutting their health in half for plus (67:12 - 67:17)
six we all have full health we all are (67:14 - 67:20)
plus three and we're all hitting play (67:17 - 67:22)
rough and everyone still has full health (67:20 - 67:24)
everyone's like still good to go we're (67:22 - 67:26)
still not we're still not getting hit by (67:24 - 67:28)
fire type moves like that's what the The (67:26 - 67:30)
Zuma conversation is so frustrating (67:28 - 67:32)
because it feels like those players are (67:30 - 67:34)
being like this is the only way to do (67:32 - 67:37)
this and it's like no like look at what (67:34 - 67:38)
just happened here this was such a cool (67:37 - 67:41)
strategy this was so like and like again (67:38 - 67:43)
that's why I recommend uh doc Dot (67:41 - 67:44)
docspun (67:43 - 67:48)
is because like out of Charizard's eight (67:44 - 67:51)
moves only two can hit it (67:48 - 67:53)
um like it's really great uh in that (67:51 - 67:56)
sense and you can feel good about that (67:53 - 67:58)
um (67:56 - 67:58)
but yeah Charizard's coming back uh so (67:58 - 68:03)
good luck (68:00 - 68:03)
go ahead you'll you'll enjoy it it'll be (68:08 - 68:12)
fine if you need help with Charizard I (68:10 - 68:15)
will be streaming that weekend and I was (68:12 - 68:16)
helping people who were struggling with (68:15 - 68:18)
Charizard clears to get their Charizard (68:16 - 68:21)
clear so uh twitch.tv (68:18 - 68:24)
pkmncsd uh same as always so if you need (68:21 - 68:27)

I'll I'll light screen you to victory (68:32 - 68:38)
um or bring your dog we can have a (68:36 - 68:41)
weekend of Who Let the Dogs Out you know (68:38 - 68:44)
um but uh I'm gonna take a we're gonna (68:41 - 68:45)
take a quick break and then uh we got (68:44 - 68:48)
some TCG news and a little bit of pogo (68:45 - 68:51)
news and we will be wrapping up the show (68:48 - 68:53)
so we'll be right back (68:51 - 68:57)
and we are back from our break uh all (68:53 - 68:59)
right (68:57 - 69:01)
some big news (68:59 - 69:03)
so I think I think I think we reported (69:01 - 69:06)
on that uh you know the Pokemon company (69:03 - 69:08)
bought (69:06 - 69:11)
uh one of the factories is that the (69:08 - 69:13)
right word factories that made the TCG (69:11 - 69:15)
cards and were like (69:13 - 69:20)
can they finally Center these cards (69:15 - 69:20)
will the take finally come I have one of (69:21 - 69:28)
my favorite Pokemon ever is sneezler a (69:25 - 69:32)
big sneezler fan love the sneezler uh I (69:29 - 69:36)
have pulled two radiant sneezlers uh (69:32 - 69:38)
which are the shiny ones in the TCG and (69:36 - 69:41)
they're so off-centered it's not even (69:38 - 69:44)
like oh they're like they're they're way (69:41 - 69:46)
off centered uh and it drives me (69:44 - 69:48)
absolutely insane that I pulled two of (69:46 - 69:49)
these (69:48 - 69:53)
and both of them are cut so badly and (69:49 - 69:54)
then of course I pulled like radiant (69:53 - 69:56)
Greninja I don't care about no Greninja (69:54 - 69:59)
Greninja is like perfectly centered (69:56 - 70:00)
um (69:59 - 70:03)
my poor sneezlers very off center (70:00 - 70:05)
anyways so they bought (70:03 - 70:09)
the factory place that makes cards in (70:05 - 70:11)
the US (70:09 - 70:13)
and now (70:11 - 70:15)
there's a brand new change coming uh (70:13 - 70:18)
this is off gameinformer.com yes there's (70:15 - 70:20)
still a website uh yes they still make a (70:18 - 70:21)
magazine (70:20 - 70:23)
um the Pokemon company has announced (70:21 - 70:24)
several changes coming to the Pokemon (70:23 - 70:26)
trading card game starting with the (70:24 - 70:27)
first expansion of the Scarlet and (70:26 - 70:29)
violet hitting series hitting stores in (70:27 - 70:31)
March in addition to the ex gameplay (70:29 - 70:34)
mechanic that was announced uh for the (70:31 - 70:35)
series in August at the World (70:34 - 70:37)
Championship uh players can expect (70:35 - 70:39)
several changes to cards and packs in (70:37 - 70:43)
any household first up the yellow (70:39 - 70:47)
borders us players well technically the (70:43 - 70:48)
entire (70:47 - 70:51)
Game Informer Game Informer technically (70:48 - 70:54)
the entire world except Japan to be let (70:51 - 70:57)
me clear that up Game Informer uh are (70:54 - 70:59)
going to match the gray borders of the (70:57 - 71:01)
Japanese cards (70:59 - 71:03)
this move is to provide more of a (71:01 - 71:04)
seamless experience for the Pokemon (71:03 - 71:06)
Trading Card Game while putting a (71:04 - 71:08)
greater emphasis on the actual artwork (71:06 - 71:11)
of the cards additionally trainer cards (71:08 - 71:13)
will now have sub categories displayed (71:11 - 71:16)
in the upper top left corner for more (71:13 - 71:18)
visibility in players hands examples (71:16 - 71:22)
given include supporter item Stadium (71:18 - 71:24)
Basic Energy cards will feature another (71:22 - 71:27)
Energy symbol at the right bottom for (71:24 - 71:30)
easier tracking during gameplay and the (71:27 - 71:33)
expansion symbol will be replaced by an (71:30 - 71:37)
expansion code and language codes across (71:33 - 71:38)
all cards (71:37 - 71:40)
there are some bad news here they they (71:38 - 71:42)
use the word Bittersweet not me I'm just (71:40 - 71:45)
gonna say it's bad news uh the bitter (71:42 - 71:47)
part is the bad part is the booster (71:45 - 71:51)
packs will go up in price the MSRP of a (71:47 - 71:54)
booster pack is 3.99 although you may (71:51 - 71:56)
argue that they were already expensive (71:54 - 71:58)
at some of your stores stores can set (71:56 - 72:00)
their own price but the recommended MSRP (71:58 - 72:07)
is 3.99 the new recommended MSRP is 449. (72:00 - 72:09)
Pokemon company hitting us with a 50 (72:07 - 72:11)
Cent God price hike geez do you know how (72:09 - 72:13)
much a gallon of milk is now I can't (72:11 - 72:15)
afford 50 cents (72:13 - 72:19)
maybe if my radiant sneezlers were cut (72:15 - 72:21)
properly I'd pay it (72:19 - 72:23)
uh the Pokemon company attributes this (72:21 - 72:26)
to Global inflation impacting the cost (72:23 - 72:28)
of material and production other (72:26 - 72:29)
products may also cost more going (72:28 - 72:32)
forward the sweet side of the news is (72:29 - 72:34)
the Pokemon TCG team will try to make up (72:32 - 72:36)
for the increased price by uh raising (72:34 - 72:39)
the number of guaranteed foil cards per (72:36 - 72:42)
pack now all cards will come with uh now (72:39 - 72:46)
that any sorry let me now all cards with (72:42 - 72:48)
a rarity of rare or higher will be (72:46 - 72:51)
foiled (72:48 - 72:51)
thank goodness the phone (72:51 - 72:56)
let me tell you how (72:57 - 73:03)
non-hollow rare cards and Hollow rare (73:00 - 73:05)
cards were one of the most frustrating (73:03 - 73:08)
things that you could possibly pull in (73:05 - 73:09)
the TCG (73:08 - 73:12)
additionally larger box items like Elite (73:09 - 73:15)
Trainer boxes we call those uh the etbs (73:12 - 73:17)
we'll include an additional item for (73:15 - 73:21)
example uh the etbs will include an (73:17 - 73:23)
additional booster pack and a full art (73:21 - 73:26)
promo card so I think (73:23 - 73:28)
so atbs are going up in price as well (73:26 - 73:31)
they're saying that they're going to add (73:28 - 73:33)
one more booster packs I think etbs are (73:31 - 73:35)
normally eight booster packs unless it's (73:33 - 73:37)
a special ETB which is already ten (73:35 - 73:40)
dollars more and that comes with 10. (73:37 - 73:42)
a little confusing uh but so those are (73:40 - 73:43)
going to come with an extra booster pack (73:42 - 73:46)
and a full art promo card (73:43 - 73:47)
um and that's pretty that's pretty much (73:46 - 73:49)
it that's that's that's all the news (73:47 - 73:51)
thank you uh Brian Shia from Game (73:49 - 73:52)
Informer for (73:51 - 73:55)
your article you know you're just the (73:52 - 73:57)
whole world has yellow cards except for (73:55 - 73:58)
Japan (73:57 - 74:00)
be clear there (73:58 - 74:04)
uh Bob you you got in a Pokemon content (74:00 - 74:06)
Creation with the TCG if I remember (74:04 - 74:09)
correctly right that is correct yeah I (74:06 - 74:11)
got back into it around the uh sun and (74:09 - 74:14)
moon era so I started uh collecting (74:11 - 74:16)
tcgs you know doing the Instagram (74:14 - 74:19)
posting you know pull you know pack (74:16 - 74:22)
battles and opening packs and uh sharing (74:19 - 74:24)
my cards I was going through my old (74:22 - 74:25)
binder of (74:24 - 74:27)
um tag team and GX cards and man that (74:25 - 74:29)
was a fun time I look I I'm a sun and (74:27 - 74:30)
moon anyway that's all another (74:29 - 74:32)
conversation but no I'm excited for this (74:30 - 74:36)
I actually um I I I like the silver (74:32 - 74:39)
borders much more than a yellow I think (74:36 - 74:41)
yellow definitely was a bit of an eye (74:39 - 74:43)
strain over the years it did take away (74:41 - 74:45)
and I agree it did take away from some (74:43 - 74:47)
of the art because that yellow just (74:45 - 74:49)
stands out and it's in your face I think (74:47 - 74:52)
the gray borders are a little more (74:49 - 74:54)
subtle I think it Blends nicely in (74:52 - 74:56)
looking at the um on the pokemon.com's (74:54 - 74:59)
website looking at the professor's (74:56 - 75:01)
research cards looking at the you know (74:59 - 75:04)
sprigatita for Cocoa crafted cards I (75:01 - 75:06)
think it just makes all the other colors (75:04 - 75:09)
pop more on it and (75:06 - 75:12)
I mean over the years and I I know you (75:09 - 75:14)
said this also Steve that japanese cards (75:12 - 75:15)
definitely had a better quality to them (75:14 - 75:18)
than even our cards (75:15 - 75:19)
um I think this is a step in the right (75:18 - 75:21)
direction I do like the uh even just the (75:19 - 75:24)
accessibility of the energy cards now (75:21 - 75:26)
have the extra logos because the way you (75:24 - 75:28)
stack cards in play whether like you're (75:26 - 75:31)
stacking them on top or side by side you (75:28 - 75:32)
can see the little Energy symbol (75:31 - 75:35)
on those uh Basic Energy cards now I (75:32 - 75:37)
think that's really good to see but yeah (75:35 - 75:39)
I know I'm I'm I'm excited for these (75:37 - 75:41)
changes I think a lot of you know (75:39 - 75:44)
Twitter was excited when we saw the uh (75:41 - 75:45)
the news broke that's how you really (75:44 - 75:47)
know they did something right yeah (75:45 - 75:50)
forget the milk and eggs increase civil (75:47 - 75:52)
borders (75:50 - 75:54)
um so I'm I'm definitely excited for (75:52 - 75:57)
this uh I uh no I haven't played the ex (75:54 - 75:59)
format when it originally uh came out (75:57 - 76:01)
because I was out of Pokemon for years (75:59 - 76:05)
so uh I'm intrigued by uh them bringing (76:01 - 76:08)
back ex as a mechanic um but no I think (76:05 - 76:11)
design wise these cards look fantastic (76:08 - 76:13)
um and I'm excited to start collecting (76:11 - 76:17)
the uh the new set as it comes out (76:13 - 76:20)
I I had I don't know if you did any TCG (76:17 - 76:22)
stuff I know you're a big go player uh (76:20 - 76:24)
but I don't know the TCG side of you if (76:22 - 76:28)
that exists I've collected them and I (76:24 - 76:30)
had one friend in college who I played (76:28 - 76:32)
Pokemon TCG with every once in a while (76:30 - 76:34)
but for the most part I'm just a (76:32 - 76:37)
collector I have the Pokemon TCG Advent (76:34 - 76:39)
calendar up on top of my desk right now (76:37 - 76:41)
so I opened them and I like looking at (76:39 - 76:44)
them but I mostly just collect them and (76:41 - 76:46)
organize them I got it I'm a little sad (76:44 - 76:48)
about the yellow borders though I will (76:46 - 76:51)
say that I'm on the side of I think they (76:48 - 76:52)
look better visually with the yellow (76:51 - 76:56)
which I know is very minority side I (76:52 - 76:57)
think most people like the gray butter (76:56 - 76:59)
but for me when I'm looking at the gray (76:57 - 77:01)
ones it looks like the edges just fall (76:59 - 77:02)
off it doesn't look like there are (77:01 - 77:04)
borders at all and that's weird to me I (77:02 - 77:06)
can see that I can see that yeah yeah (77:04 - 77:09)
that if if you were a Japanese TCG (77:06 - 77:11)
collector there was always the debate of (77:09 - 77:14)
like silver or yellow (77:11 - 77:14)
um (77:14 - 77:17)
I think I think I think the changes are (77:14 - 77:18)
great (77:17 - 77:19)
um (77:18 - 77:23)
the the thing in the corner uh is is (77:19 - 77:25)
actually really great so if if you don't (77:23 - 77:28)
know the the sets were always determined (77:25 - 77:30)
by some sort of symbol (77:28 - 77:33)
um and unless you had unless you were (77:30 - 77:36)
like so into the TCG (77:33 - 77:37)
um (77:36 - 77:39)
I mean I collected almost every single (77:37 - 77:41)
set of sword and shield (77:39 - 77:43)
and I couldn't even I can't even tell (77:41 - 77:45)
you the the symbols in the corner like I (77:43 - 77:47)
I like Vivid voltage I have no clue what (77:45 - 77:49)
that symbol looks like if if you were to (77:47 - 77:51)
show me like eight symbols I don't know (77:49 - 77:53)
if I could tell you which one is vivid (77:51 - 77:56)
voltage or which one isn't Vivid voltage (77:53 - 78:00)
um so they they do this in Japan where (77:56 - 78:02)
instead of like a symbol it'll say the (78:00 - 78:05)
set and then um it'll say like the the (78:02 - 78:10)
subset so uh this just says like SV and (78:05 - 78:13)
then one and then en for English so this (78:10 - 78:14)
is (78:13 - 78:17)
sword and Scarlet and violet (78:14 - 78:20)
first set and so I'm assuming whatever (78:17 - 78:24)
the second one will be will be sv2 so I (78:20 - 78:26)
I think that makes it really easy to (78:24 - 78:28)
like follow along of like what car like (78:26 - 78:30)
what card is this in okay this card is (78:28 - 78:35)
an sv3 great cool versus like this set (78:30 - 78:38)
this card is in uh silver Tempest (78:35 - 78:41)
what symbol like what symbol is that (78:38 - 78:43)
like yeah I could go buy silver Tempest (78:41 - 78:44)
but if I'm like looking at my collection (78:43 - 78:46)
and all the cards are open I have to (78:44 - 78:49)
like look up what symbols silver Tempest (78:46 - 78:50)
is to be like okay cool like that's (78:49 - 78:53)
that's the symbol I'm looking for again (78:50 - 78:55)
just really great for accessibility (78:53 - 78:56)
um (78:55 - 78:58)
uh and obviously you could you could (78:56 - 79:00)
maybe say that the the energy is good (78:58 - 79:01)
for accessibility but I think that's (79:00 - 79:04)
more for (79:01 - 79:05)
um people hiding putting car like just (79:04 - 79:09)
putting cards well again yeah yeah both (79:05 - 79:11)
in that situation but (79:09 - 79:14)
the thing that I wish they just would (79:11 - 79:16)
have done they're so close they're just (79:14 - 79:18)
they're just so close that you you (79:16 - 79:20)
change the Border you change the set (79:18 - 79:23)
numbers you change the energy cards just (79:20 - 79:27)
change the back of the Pokemon card it (79:23 - 79:30)
is so yep (79:27 - 79:33)
ugly and outdated it does the Pokeball (79:30 - 79:35)
doesn't even open the right way it opens (79:33 - 79:37)
the wrong way (79:35 - 79:40)
now before anyone listening the show (79:37 - 79:42)
they're like but that would invalidate (79:40 - 79:44)
all these years of Pokemon cards number (79:42 - 79:46)
one they're gonna be invalidated of it (79:44 - 79:47)
anyways all the cards have their own (79:46 - 79:49)
time frame they're gonna be like yeah (79:47 - 79:52)
Japan did this though there are two (79:49 - 79:55)
Japanese backs at a certain point Japan (79:52 - 79:56)
was like you know what we're changing (79:55 - 79:59)
the back and they did and the the new (79:56 - 80:01)
Japanese back looks great (79:59 - 80:04)
and it feels like it will look great in (80:01 - 80:07)
another 10 years the current worldwide (80:04 - 80:08)
back that is in Japan I don't want to (80:07 - 80:10)
say English because this applies to (80:08 - 80:11)
every car that is in Japanese (80:10 - 80:14)
looks terrible (80:11 - 80:16)
they could have upped this would have (80:14 - 80:18)
been the perfect time to be like you (80:16 - 80:19)
know what (80:18 - 80:22)
we're updating the back sorry good luck (80:19 - 80:24)
new season just just (80:22 - 80:27)
they're so close they're so close to (80:24 - 80:29)
changing the back just do it (80:27 - 80:32)
I you know yeah I I wish they would (80:29 - 80:34)
change the back because I you know first (80:32 - 80:36)
of all most people you get a good car (80:34 - 80:38)
you put into a sleeve you ain't seeing (80:36 - 80:39)
that back (80:38 - 80:41)
um you ain't looking at it (80:39 - 80:43)
um (80:41 - 80:46)
and if you're competitive (80:43 - 80:49)
the es format is going to power creep (80:46 - 80:52)
over the V like there will be some V and (80:49 - 80:54)
some V Max and some ex but the the thing (80:52 - 80:56)
about the TCG is always power creeps (80:54 - 80:58)
itself so like (80:56 - 80:59)
yeah if you change the back you're (80:58 - 81:01)
cutting off all these Hollow energies (80:59 - 81:02)
you're cutting off all these old (81:01 - 81:05)
trainers (81:02 - 81:05)
there's not there's never going to be a (81:05 - 81:10)
good time to change it you like (81:07 - 81:12)
just cut it do it now just change it now (81:10 - 81:16)
in a new set with ex you're changing the (81:12 - 81:20)
borders you have you own the factory now (81:16 - 81:21)
just change the back (81:20 - 81:24)
like at this point just match the (81:21 - 81:26)
Japanese back you've matched the (81:24 - 81:29)
Japanese silver border like we already (81:26 - 81:31)
have these weird language rules (81:29 - 81:36)
across the world and like if you're if (81:31 - 81:38)
you're playing in in the US you have to (81:36 - 81:40)
have English cards if you're playing in (81:38 - 81:42)
Europe you can have English you can have (81:40 - 81:43)
German you can have Italian you can have (81:42 - 81:45)
Spanish if you're playing in Japanese (81:43 - 81:47)
you can only have japanese cards if (81:45 - 81:50)
you're playing in Mexico you can have (81:47 - 81:54)
Spanish and English and Italian like (81:50 - 81:58)
unify it you're so close (81:54 - 82:01)
you're so close to unifying these games (81:58 - 82:03)
I mean Hannah as a collector what do you (82:01 - 82:05)
like do you think if they change that (82:03 - 82:07)
back does that ruin like Nostalgia for (82:05 - 82:09)
you or I don't know oh I don't know if (82:07 - 82:12)
you even look at the backs of the cards (82:09 - 82:14)
no I know what the box of the cards look (82:12 - 82:18)
like um I'm not sure I know the (82:14 - 82:19)
difference ones because most of the (82:18 - 82:21)
Japanese cards I have are old (82:19 - 82:23)
um and I'm not I'm not a thorough (82:21 - 82:25)
collector I kind of just get cards when (82:23 - 82:26)
they make me happy I get cards for (82:25 - 82:28)
Christmas (82:26 - 82:32)
but no I think that changing the backs (82:28 - 82:35)
is just fine I and you put you have to (82:32 - 82:36)
put them in sleeves for competitions (82:35 - 82:38)
anyways right that's required that's (82:36 - 82:40)
that's one of the reasons I never played (82:38 - 82:43)
it's expensive (82:40 - 82:43)
um yeah in in well that was like a weird (82:43 - 82:49)
role too uh because there was there we (82:46 - 82:50)
talked about this there was a person (82:49 - 82:53)
that brought like the jumbo cards (82:50 - 82:56)
and they brought like 60 jumbo cards (82:53 - 82:59)
um and I swore one of the rules where (82:56 - 83:02)
they have to be sleeved (82:59 - 83:04)
um and they said no technically they (83:02 - 83:06)
don't per the rule book I swear that was (83:04 - 83:08)
a rule but the every tournament I've (83:06 - 83:10)
went to (83:08 - 83:12)
and this might be just up to the (83:10 - 83:14)
tournament organizer like you could not (83:12 - 83:17)
use Clear sleeves and they you would (83:14 - 83:20)
have to use a full back sleeve you could (83:17 - 83:22)
also not use sleeves again these could (83:20 - 83:24)
just be the rules of the specific (83:22 - 83:26)
tournament I'm not 100 sure you cannot (83:24 - 83:30)
use sleeves that had a border themselves (83:26 - 83:32)
so like if you look at like the back of (83:30 - 83:34)
the sleeve which would cover the back of (83:32 - 83:36)
the card like that couldn't have like a (83:34 - 83:39)
square border because you couldn't (83:36 - 83:43)
um you couldn't align it perfectly with (83:39 - 83:45)
printing so some of the borders would be (83:43 - 83:48)
offset and then you would be able to (83:45 - 83:50)
then tell which card is in which sleeve (83:48 - 83:53)
so the the the back of the sleeve had to (83:50 - 83:56)
be either a solid color or just a (83:53 - 84:00)
pattern that didn't hit a border so you (83:56 - 84:01)
couldn't (84:00 - 84:03)
um you couldn't tell which card which (84:01 - 84:06)
which when I go back to like the that (84:03 - 84:09)
the person brought 60 jumbo cards and (84:06 - 84:12)
they weren't sleeved I was like well the (84:09 - 84:13)
whole point of the rule of them being (84:12 - 84:16)
sleeved is because like cards get nicked (84:13 - 84:17)
so easily so if you knew you're like (84:16 - 84:20)
Charizard V Max had like a Nick in the (84:17 - 84:23)
upper left hand corner you could find it (84:20 - 84:25)
easier (84:23 - 84:26)
um don't get me started on cheating in (84:25 - 84:28)
the TCG it's very would be here for (84:26 - 84:30)
another hour (84:28 - 84:31)
um (84:30 - 84:34)
but like (84:31 - 84:34)
yeah you have to you have to sleep you (84:34 - 84:38)
have to sleep them anyways (84:36 - 84:40)
um and they again from my understanding (84:38 - 84:42)
they can't be clear (84:40 - 84:45)
I don't know if that's they're I'm sure (84:42 - 84:46)
ever since the incident of bringing the (84:45 - 84:48)
jumbo card that's gonna be the the rules (84:46 - 84:50)
are gonna be Rewritten to the point of (84:48 - 84:51)
like (84:50 - 84:53)
you cannot bring jumbo cards also they (84:51 - 84:56)
need to be sleeved I know if you made (84:53 - 84:58)
Top Cut in a tournament again maybe (84:56 - 85:00)
these were just the because I've made (84:58 - 85:02)
Top Cut before (85:00 - 85:03)
um (85:02 - 85:05)
and maybe they were just up to my (85:03 - 85:07)
tournament organizers because obviously (85:05 - 85:09)
Pokemon trusts the tournament organizers (85:07 - 85:11)
to follow the rules and maybe insert (85:09 - 85:12)
their own rules when needed as long as (85:11 - 85:14)
it follows the spirit of the game if you (85:12 - 85:16)
made Top Cut (85:14 - 85:17)
you would have to re-sleeve your whole (85:16 - 85:18)
deck (85:17 - 85:21)
so if you played like eight matches made (85:18 - 85:23)
Top Cut you made it to Top Cut you had (85:21 - 85:25)
to put brand new sleeves on for every (85:23 - 85:28)
Top Cut match (85:25 - 85:31)
uh wow to prevent people nicking cards (85:28 - 85:35)
or like whatever or like you don't want (85:31 - 85:37)
a card to rip while you're shuffling and (85:35 - 85:38)
stuff so (85:37 - 85:40)
maybe that's different than like a (85:38 - 85:42)
California or a Canada or a uh you know (85:40 - 85:44)
a London but like at least in the (85:42 - 85:46)
Midwest of the tournaments I played in (85:44 - 85:48)
the tournaments I top cut it in you had (85:46 - 85:51)
to re-sleeve uh when you hit Top Cut (85:48 - 85:53)
um and then you know you know top eight (85:51 - 85:56)
top four top two you had to re-sleeve (85:53 - 85:57)
and the tournament organizers would give (85:56 - 85:59)
you sleeves you didn't have to you could (85:57 - 86:01)
use your own sleeves like if you had a (85:59 - 86:02)
brand new pack of you know Pokemon (86:01 - 86:04)
Center sleeves you could sleeve them (86:02 - 86:06)
yourself but they would have like black (86:04 - 86:08)
or green or blue (86:06 - 86:10)
like Ultra Pros that they would give you (86:08 - 86:12)
for making top cut that you would (86:10 - 86:14)
re-sleeve in between (86:12 - 86:16)
interesting yeah that's the number one (86:14 - 86:18)
reason I've seen for them not changing (86:16 - 86:19)
the backs and so I don't really (86:18 - 86:22)
understand that being a reason (86:19 - 86:23)
I think that it's fine if they change (86:22 - 86:26)
the bags yeah I think I think I think I (86:23 - 86:27)
think so too (86:26 - 86:29)
I think so too uh last bit of news we (86:27 - 86:32)
have here is uh Pokemon go did two (86:29 - 86:35)
things uh well Pokemon go is always (86:32 - 86:37)
doing something (86:35 - 86:38)
um (86:37 - 86:42)
uh first we have a Pokemon go at Pokemon (86:38 - 86:44)
Festival I'm gonna say this wrong (86:42 - 86:46)
Jakarta (86:44 - 86:50)
oh okay which uh (86:46 - 86:53)
uh is in Indonesia (86:50 - 86:56)
yes not India which I put in the notes (86:53 - 87:00)
I'm geographically bad at everything I (86:56 - 87:04)
don't is Indonesia south of Singapore (87:00 - 87:06)
am I wrong on that (87:04 - 87:09)
gosh I don't know where that is I am the (87:06 - 87:11)
wrong person to ask unfortunately I (87:09 - 87:12)
shouldn't know this as a trivia guy (87:11 - 87:15)
because I've always asked hey where is (87:12 - 87:17)
this place located I know the Hopeless (87:15 - 87:19)
cluster of like islands and stuff in (87:17 - 87:23)
that geographical part of the world (87:19 - 87:23)
uh I oh okay so the this this event (87:23 - 87:30)
is from December 8th through January 8th (87:27 - 87:33)
and they published it on Pokemon go (87:30 - 87:38)
live.com on December 8th (87:33 - 87:38)
so (87:39 - 87:42)
we all complain about Niantic not giving (87:44 - 87:49)
us a heads up about Community Day what (87:47 - 87:51)
happened here (87:49 - 87:54)
it seems like maybe some creators got (87:51 - 87:56)
a heads up maybe because Zoe two dots is (87:54 - 88:00)
going yeah Zoe is there right now I I am (87:56 - 88:05)
in the Niantic uh Creator group thingy (88:00 - 88:07)
um I don't remember them saying this (88:05 - 88:10)
event was coming (88:07 - 88:12)
okay (88:10 - 88:16)
I'm looking I'm looking (88:12 - 88:19)
I see the ultra Beast I I don't to be (88:16 - 88:22)
fair though I believe my Niantic Creator (88:19 - 88:26)
group is for America and (88:22 - 88:28)
um like Europe (88:26 - 88:32)
and I think that Japan and (88:28 - 88:35)
Asia and I (88:32 - 88:36)
Australia is weird because Australia is (88:35 - 88:41)
like not mostly English right uh (88:36 - 88:44)
uh I I think that is I think they have (88:41 - 88:45)
their own group (88:44 - 88:48)
I only think that because uh when I was (88:45 - 88:50)
going to South Korea they asked who was (88:48 - 88:52)
going to South Korea and I was like one (88:50 - 88:53)
of two people in the group that were (88:52 - 88:55)
like yeah I'm going to South Korea and (88:53 - 88:56)
they brought in (88:55 - 88:59)
a different manager and they're like hi (88:56 - 89:01)
I'm in charge of like Asia Pacific and I (88:59 - 89:02)
was like oh nice to meet you I never (89:01 - 89:05)
ended up meeting them in South Korea (89:02 - 89:08)
um because like uh (89:05 - 89:10)
I had a camera on my shoulder and so (89:08 - 89:12)
it's like weird to like meet people for (89:10 - 89:14)
the first time especially like in a (89:12 - 89:15)
business relationship to be like hi it's (89:14 - 89:18)
finally nice to meet you also now your (89:15 - 89:20)
face is on the internet (89:18 - 89:21)
um I already know that people dislike (89:20 - 89:24)
Niantic and the last thing I want to do (89:21 - 89:26)
is to put a Niantic manager on a camera (89:24 - 89:29)
for people to identify who they are I (89:26 - 89:33)
don't trust people on the internet (89:29 - 89:33)
so I never ended up meeting them I'm (89:34 - 89:39)
sure they're very nice uh but uh (89:36 - 89:41)
but yeah this event is happening it is (89:39 - 89:45)
it is uh so if from Thursday December (89:41 - 89:47)
8th through Sunday January 8th from 8 (89:45 - 89:51)
A.M to 8pm local time uh it looks like (89:47 - 89:53)
it's in this like Convention Center uh (89:51 - 89:55)
you'll be able to complete field (89:53 - 89:56)
research that will give you party hat (89:55 - 89:58)

Bulbasaur party at Squirtle if you're (89:58 - 90:01)
lucky you may encounter a shiny one (90:00 - 90:05)
trainers at the Pik which I think is the (90:01 - 90:07)
convention center name (90:05 - 90:11)
um we'll get half hatch uh distance (90:07 - 90:13)
confetti three times catch XP special (90:11 - 90:16)

streamed oh that was yesterday I have no (90:35 - 90:38)
clue if it was I'm sure it was fantastic (90:36 - 90:40)
I'm sure it was great and then December (90:38 - 90:43)
17th through 18th there will be uh you (90:40 - 90:45)
can celebrate Community Day there and (90:43 - 90:48)
then please stay tuned to uh official (90:45 - 90:50)
Indonesian social networks for more (90:48 - 90:51)
updates (90:50 - 90:54)
so I wonder if this was like the ultra (90:51 - 90:56)
Beast event where when you walk inside (90:54 - 90:58)
the convention center they hand you a QR (90:56 - 91:00)
code you scan it and then you get the (90:58 - 91:03)
half egg distance the confetti the XP (91:00 - 91:06)
because I don't know how they would (91:03 - 91:09)
contain that in the convention center (91:06 - 91:11)
I don't think it is (91:09 - 91:13)
I mean I watched a video because Zoe's (91:11 - 91:16)
there I watched a video it it looks like (91:13 - 91:18)
the whole city is kind of decked out or (91:16 - 91:20)
at least a large area is decked out in (91:18 - 91:22)
Pokemon stuff that their extra pokestops (91:20 - 91:25)
everywhere it looks super exciting it's (91:22 - 91:27)
like just like geofence the entire area (91:25 - 91:29)
so that as long as you're within those (91:27 - 91:31)
boundaries you can just get access to (91:29 - 91:33)
the um the event (91:31 - 91:35)
yeah I I would guess (91:33 - 91:41)
um I saw Zoe uh uh do like a a race (91:35 - 91:43)
like like she was like in a Pokemon like (91:41 - 91:47)
5K or 10K or something and I was like I (91:43 - 91:49)
didn't see the outcome yeah that sounds (91:47 - 91:50)
really cool I know that's a big thing (91:49 - 91:55)
with Disney not a Disney boy or a Disney (91:50 - 91:56)
adult (91:55 - 91:57)
um I know there are a lot of Disney (91:56 - 92:01)
adults uh very like you do you I'm just (91:57 - 92:03)
not a Disney person but I do know Disney (92:01 - 92:06)
hosts like tons of like 5Ks or 10ks (92:03 - 92:07)
right where like you like dress up too (92:06 - 92:08)
of like (92:07 - 92:12)
we're all Cinderella or Ariel or (92:08 - 92:15)
to whoever else is uh put the girl from (92:12 - 92:19)
Frozen Elsa Elsa yep (92:15 - 92:19)
um Pokemon should do some more 5Ks I (92:20 - 92:24)
would love (92:23 - 92:27)
I didn't think I wanted one I don't want (92:24 - 92:30)
to run at all actually like but if if (92:27 - 92:32)
there's like a Pokemon 5K in Chicago I'd (92:30 - 92:34)
be very interested in going and doing it (92:32 - 92:36)
I've I've run a 5k that was like one of (92:34 - 92:39)
my goals when I was like 25 or 26 was (92:36 - 92:42)
like to run a 5k and I did it and I felt (92:39 - 92:44)
very good at after (92:42 - 92:47)
uh yeah after the last three years I'm (92:44 - 92:50)
kind of way more out of shape than I (92:47 - 92:54)
prefer but a 5k isn't that long that was (92:50 - 92:57)
that one three miles (92:54 - 92:57)
yeah don't be the weakest link and it's (92:57 - 93:02)
one five (93:00 - 93:07)
no 5K is around three miles yeah it is (93:02 - 93:09)
maybe I'll do that for 2023 maybe I'll (93:07 - 93:11)
do a you know races are expensive though (93:09 - 93:13)
I did the Color Run that was the race I (93:11 - 93:15)
did I think it was like 60 bucks and I (93:13 - 93:18)
was like I gotta pay to suffer (93:15 - 93:20)
if you if you come to if you come to (93:18 - 93:22)
Raleigh you should uh we had I've been (93:20 - 93:24)
called the uh like the Krispy Kreme run (93:22 - 93:27)
where you top it I'm already in listen (93:24 - 93:29)
you got you got a dozen Krispy Kreme (93:27 - 93:32)
Donuts you run five miles Steve you come (93:29 - 93:35)
down here I will you know Lodge with me (93:32 - 93:37)
we'll do it together (93:35 - 93:37)
I've seen a lot of my I I have uh my (93:39 - 93:44)
friends Aaron and Cheryl uh Aaron (93:42 - 93:46)
actually very on the podcast like 12 (93:44 - 93:47)
years ago (93:46 - 93:49)
um they they do runs all the time and (93:47 - 93:50)
they're they're they always see like (93:49 - 93:52)
beer runs where at the end they give you (93:50 - 93:54)
like a beer and I'm like that's the last (93:52 - 93:56)
thing I want to drink after running (93:54 - 93:58)
three miles is like I don't want to slam (93:56 - 94:00)
a beer that's something I don't want to (93:58 - 94:02)
slime a beer when I'm normal (94:00 - 94:06)
that's a mood yeah (94:02 - 94:06)
um so the Jakarta event is happening (94:06 - 94:12)
um if you're in Indonesia or around the (94:09 - 94:14)
area I guess you got time to travel to (94:12 - 94:16)
it still (94:14 - 94:18)
so uh that's cool (94:16 - 94:20)
um good for them too I I think sometimes (94:18 - 94:22)
the Japan gets all these events Europe (94:20 - 94:24)
gets all these events uh Australia (94:22 - 94:26)
doesn't get anything (94:24 - 94:28)
um New Zealand they're just beta testers (94:26 - 94:31)
um it's good to see events in other (94:28 - 94:34)
countries as as go as a worldwide game (94:31 - 94:36)
final bit of good news here is uh there (94:34 - 94:39)
are new sizes introduced in go (94:36 - 94:42)
uh you can discover extra extra small (94:39 - 94:44)
Pokemon and extra extra large Pokemon (94:42 - 94:47)
Pokemon such as Poochyena Mightyena and (94:44 - 94:49)
Mawile have been recently observed with (94:47 - 94:51)
different sizes and your Pokedex has (94:49 - 94:54)
been updated to track the sizes (94:51 - 94:56)
um keep a sharp eye out as you will see (94:54 - 94:59)
updated records in your Pokedex (94:56 - 95:02)
uh I haven't seen a single pucciana (94:59 - 95:06)
spawn I don't okay Niantic (95:02 - 95:07)
um (95:06 - 95:10)
and then they will actually show the (95:07 - 95:12)
size variation standing next to you (95:10 - 95:13)
which is really cool so the example they (95:12 - 95:14)
show here on the website Pokemon (95:13 - 95:17)
golive.com is a very tiny poochian and (95:14 - 95:18)
then a really actually decently sized (95:17 - 95:20)
Poochyena it's like triple the size (95:18 - 95:22)
honestly (95:20 - 95:24)
um size is now tracked in the Pokedex (95:22 - 95:26)
you'll get a little like message that'll (95:24 - 95:28)
pop up being like oh this Pokemon is (95:26 - 95:31)
really big uh which is like I don't know (95:28 - 95:33)
that stuff is maybe for hardcore people (95:31 - 95:35)
they probably don't care but like you (95:33 - 95:37)
know if you play Pokemon go like once a (95:35 - 95:40)
week or once a month and you're like I (95:37 - 95:41)
already have a Caterpie but if I catch (95:40 - 95:42)
this Caterpie you'll get that little (95:41 - 95:45)
message of like this canopy is huge (95:42 - 95:47)
um which I think is like cool I don't (95:45 - 95:48)
know I don't I don't think it's a bad (95:47 - 95:49)
change (95:48 - 95:52)
no I like the animations that that come (95:49 - 95:53)
with it I think it's cool when I first (95:52 - 95:56)
saw this article no joke I thought they (95:53 - 95:58)
meant oh you can change your character (95:56 - 96:00)
size I'm like yeah I'm not this thin I (95:58 - 96:02)
want to have a little more a little more (96:00 - 96:04)
girth around me with the midsection and (96:02 - 96:07)
a little broader shoulders why not but (96:04 - 96:08)
um they need more character (96:07 - 96:10)
customization they have for a long time (96:08 - 96:12)
but this does this does again make me (96:10 - 96:15)
miss uh you know Legends Arceus because (96:12 - 96:16)
like we have the different sizes of (96:15 - 96:18)
Pokemon in the game you can like put (96:16 - 96:20)
them side by side you can see them I (96:18 - 96:21)
really do like how you can go to the (96:20 - 96:24)
trainer View and see like a larger (96:21 - 96:27)
poochiana or a larger version so I think (96:24 - 96:28)
if you're a collector this is this is (96:27 - 96:30)
actually pretty cool because you can get (96:28 - 96:31)
different sizes and you can see the (96:30 - 96:34)
different sizes so nice little touch I (96:31 - 96:36)
can only imagine like those people that (96:34 - 96:40)
raid for level 100 IV groudons or (96:36 - 96:42)
rayquazas and they'll be like I want a I (96:40 - 96:44)
want a perfect IV Rayquaza but I wanted (96:42 - 96:47)
to be tiny I I'd imagine that that is (96:44 - 96:50)
like something that those those players (96:47 - 96:53)
are maybe not not a lot maybe like point (96:50 - 96:55)
zero zero one percent of them but like (96:53 - 96:57)
I'd imagine it would be like look at my (96:55 - 97:00)
perfect lucky shiny extremely extremely (96:57 - 97:03)
tiny Rayquaza floating next to me (97:00 - 97:05)
I want to see that right away but (97:03 - 97:07)
honestly I would be impressed pocket (97:05 - 97:09)
size pocket size (97:07 - 97:11)
I'm just confused why they're rolling it (97:09 - 97:14)
out (97:11 - 97:14)
best reaction best reaction Niantic in a (97:14 - 97:21)
nutshell you got so many things to work (97:19 - 97:23)
on and this is what you look I am sure (97:21 - 97:25)
the team working on this that was their (97:23 - 97:27)
thing that was their baby (97:25 - 97:29)
like (97:27 - 97:33)
uh it was an interesting thing to do but (97:29 - 97:35)
yeah I also want to know if it carries (97:33 - 97:37)
over to the main games (97:35 - 97:39)
that if you get a tiny tiny Pokemon in (97:37 - 97:40)
Pokemon go and you transfer it up to (97:39 - 97:43)
home if then you put it in Arceus or (97:40 - 97:45)
eventually in Scrabble it Violet if (97:43 - 97:47)
it'll still be tiny (97:45 - 97:49)
or not that's a good point I don't know (97:47 - 97:51)
if people have tested that yet I've been (97:49 - 97:53)
kind of still sucked into scarlet and (97:51 - 97:54)
violet I admittedly haven't been and go (97:53 - 97:59)
as much these days same hahaha (97:54 - 97:59)
I I the last big big change that they (98:00 - 98:06)
did which I think everyone liked was the (98:04 - 98:08)
change to the Mega System (98:06 - 98:09)
um (98:08 - 98:11)
where like I didn't hear a single (98:09 - 98:13)
complaint honestly and I I remember I (98:11 - 98:16)
met the person who made the mega well (98:13 - 98:17)
one of the people it was obviously a (98:16 - 98:20)
team but she I met her at uh St Louis (98:17 - 98:22)
when I went there (98:20 - 98:24)
for a community day and it got rained (98:22 - 98:28)
out and she was there and we talked for (98:24 - 98:31)
a bit and she she was like I remember (98:28 - 98:32)
her saying like oh she like (98:31 - 98:33)
screenshotted things on Reddit because (98:32 - 98:35)
people were actually saying good things (98:33 - 98:37)
about Pokemon go and it like warmed her (98:35 - 98:39)
heart and I was like that's very sweet (98:37 - 98:42)
like I get it right like (98:39 - 98:45)
change (98:42 - 98:48)
yeah I mean like I like it's it's so (98:45 - 98:52)
sometimes uh uh sucks being like (98:48 - 98:54)
somebody who creates something like we (98:52 - 98:56)
did that podcast series and I always (98:54 - 99:00)
know when a podcast hits a new audience (98:56 - 99:03)
because the amount of negative comments (99:00 - 99:06)
increases uh like I think somebody was (99:03 - 99:08)
like ah I couldn't stand the guy in the (99:06 - 99:11)
middle uh on like the last episode it's (99:08 - 99:13)
like bro my name was on the screen for (99:11 - 99:15)
two hours like you could have just (99:13 - 99:16)
brought Steve you didn't have to write (99:15 - 99:19)
the guy in the middle like if you I (99:16 - 99:21)
appreciate you listening but also like (99:19 - 99:24)
name is right here (99:21 - 99:29)
the guy in the middle like anyways (99:24 - 99:30)
um (99:29 - 99:31)
but like there's so many positive (99:30 - 99:35)
comments too uh and so so uh (99:31 - 99:36)
I I don't know if there's gonna be a lot (99:35 - 99:38)
of positive comments about XX small and (99:36 - 99:42)
XXL but I I do wonder what (99:38 - 99:44)
she and her team are doing not that the (99:42 - 99:46)
mega thing was done because I remember (99:44 - 99:49)
seeing her again at um Saint or Not St (99:46 - 99:52)
Louis um Seattle at go Fest (99:49 - 99:53)
and she was like yeah we're working on (99:52 - 99:56)
something else and really really excited (99:53 - 99:58)
um but we can't talk about it (99:56 - 100:00)
I don't think it's this (99:58 - 100:01)
um (100:00 - 100:03)
yeah maybe it's something but like (100:01 - 100:06)
whatever the only point I'm making is (100:03 - 100:08)
what that team that made Mega (100:06 - 100:11)
whatever they're working on (100:08 - 100:12)
I hope it's as good as the mega because (100:11 - 100:16)
that that change was so great (100:12 - 100:18)
um it could have been the um the Gimme (100:16 - 100:20)
ghoul (100:18 - 100:22)
oh introduction because that was really (100:20 - 100:23)
cool (100:22 - 100:25)
that was a very cool yeah afternoon (100:23 - 100:27)
evening yeah the Gimme ghoul stuff was (100:25 - 100:29)
cool and it worked it could have been (100:27 - 100:31)
the zarua stuff which would have been (100:29 - 100:32)
cool (100:31 - 100:35)
if it didn't break yeah because I (100:32 - 100:38)
remember seeing New Zealand get that (100:35 - 100:40)
because you know they're beta testers uh (100:38 - 100:42)
and then like people seemed really (100:40 - 100:44)
excited honestly and I remember seeing (100:42 - 100:46)
people being like Oh I'm gonna change my (100:44 - 100:48)
buddy for this event because I really (100:46 - 100:50)
want to see this Pokemon spawn (100:48 - 100:53)
everywhere uh which I I think I was (100:50 - 100:55)
walking with a sigilith at the time so I (100:53 - 100:56)
was like yeah I want to see like 30 (100:55 - 100:58)
sigilists around me I think that would (100:56 - 101:01)
be really cool and then that event broke (100:58 - 101:02)
um (101:01 - 101:05)
I don't think this broke I don't I think (101:02 - 101:08)
it works I played Pogo yesterday uh (101:05 - 101:11)
I don't know it seems fine uh (101:08 - 101:14)
okay one question and then we'll wrap up (101:11 - 101:17)
question is did you buy the eight seven (101:14 - 101:21)
seven ninety nine Keldeo ticket (101:17 - 101:21)
no (101:21 - 101:24)
I did not (101:25 - 101:29)
um (101:27 - 101:29)
you still got time yeah I don't know (101:29 - 101:35)
maybe I should get back into a little (101:33 - 101:38)
bit of more go but then I I didn't buy (101:35 - 101:41)
the mime stuff when it came out also (101:38 - 101:42)
um (101:41 - 101:45)
I I think I saved my expenses for like (101:42 - 101:47)
event like like Community Day stuff like (101:45 - 101:49)
I pay like the 99 Cents get the (101:47 - 101:51)
storyline and you know do that but uh (101:49 - 101:54)
yeah no I I didn't do it yet (101:51 - 101:56)
yeah I've thought a little bit more (101:54 - 102:00)
about it since last podcast (101:56 - 102:03)
um I did buy it okay (102:00 - 102:05)
I wouldn't recommend most people buy it (102:03 - 102:07)
I also haven't accomplished I think (102:05 - 102:09)
anything in it because I've been playing (102:07 - 102:12)
too much scarlet and violet and uh (102:09 - 102:14)
running about running errands this week (102:12 - 102:16)
but I do think (102:14 - 102:19)
that more of the reason I I like these (102:16 - 102:21)
things is because I like having (102:19 - 102:23)
something to work towards I like having (102:21 - 102:25)
the goals in game and I like the little (102:23 - 102:27)
story Parts because I think those have (102:25 - 102:30)
been getting better however I don't (102:27 - 102:32)
think it should be paid I think there (102:30 - 102:33)
should be reasonable goals to work (102:32 - 102:36)
towards in-game uh that you don't have (102:33 - 102:37)
to pay for (102:36 - 102:40)
and there are plenty but when you when (102:37 - 102:41)
you've gotten to the point where you've (102:40 - 102:44)
run out of field research to work on or (102:41 - 102:46)
story research to work on (102:44 - 102:49)
that's when I lose track of the game I (102:46 - 102:50)
think that that's one of the things that (102:49 - 102:52)
really makes me excited to play the game (102:50 - 102:53)
I like having something that I can (102:52 - 102:55)
accomplish I like having the little (102:53 - 102:58)
story to get through and (102:55 - 103:00)
so I like having it I will enjoy it when (102:58 - 103:02)
I play it I will eventually get through (103:00 - 103:04)
it and I should probably get through the (103:02 - 103:06)
catch however many fighting types fits (103:04 - 103:08)
today (103:06 - 103:11)
yeah I I went to mall America to finish (103:08 - 103:12)
my (103:11 - 103:15)
the catch challenge for the fighting (103:12 - 103:17)
stuff (103:15 - 103:18)
um (103:17 - 103:21)
and then I saw the sizes uh and then I (103:18 - 103:25)
started the Keldeo thing but I think one (103:21 - 103:28)
of it was like battle five leaders not (103:25 - 103:30)
rocket leaders just the (103:28 - 103:32)
was it really I thought interesting not (103:30 - 103:35)
not even just team go rocket grunts I (103:32 - 103:38)
bad leaders I battled Cliff because I (103:35 - 103:41)
have like 20 rocket Radars from other (103:38 - 103:43)
events it says battle a team leader (103:41 - 103:45)
three times and it did not count my (103:43 - 103:49)
battle against Cliff so I'm assuming (103:45 - 103:53)
that is like the Candela yeah that's (103:49 - 103:56)
Candela and Spark and so yeah I I did (103:53 - 103:57)
not want to do that while walking the (103:56 - 103:59)
mall I felt like that was something I (103:57 - 104:00)
could do on my couch (103:59 - 104:03)
yeah no you can at least for the buddy (104:00 - 104:05)
system you can do those by uh entering (104:03 - 104:08)
the battle and running so okay perfect I (104:05 - 104:12)
could have done that on them all then (104:08 - 104:12)
I don't know if it'll work that way for (104:12 - 104:17)
this but for the body system that counts (104:14 - 104:18)
okay (104:17 - 104:21)
because I do not want to battle them (104:18 - 104:23)
I (104:21 - 104:25)
can I tell a fun quick story yeah of (104:23 - 104:26)
course (104:25 - 104:31)
that there is that one Platinum badge in (104:26 - 104:34)
Pokemon go that is train however many (104:31 - 104:36)
times I think it is 2 000 times that (104:34 - 104:38)
used to be super easy and you used to be (104:36 - 104:41)
able to do it by battling Gems or (104:38 - 104:42)
battling others or something else like (104:41 - 104:44)
that and then when they introduced the (104:42 - 104:48)
uh train with your leaders bit then it (104:44 - 104:49)
was restricted to you can only make (104:48 - 104:51)
progress on this badge by training with (104:49 - 104:52)
the leaders (104:51 - 104:57)
and I finished that badge after years of (104:52 - 105:00)
just having a my one set water type team (104:57 - 105:03)
and tapping against Candela it takes so (105:00 - 105:05)
much time to finish that and I would not (105:03 - 105:07)
recommend getting that Platinum badge to (105:05 - 105:09)
anyone else but I Am So Satisfied that I (105:07 - 105:12)
finished it I am so glad to be done with (105:09 - 105:13)
that badge (105:12 - 105:15)
I wish I was one of those people that (105:13 - 105:18)
lived on a gym because they have the (105:15 - 105:21)
distinctive advantage to feed berries (105:18 - 105:24)
non-stop it's still so annoying though (105:21 - 105:28)
yeah it is I was living on the gym for (105:24 - 105:30)
the last year until a little while ago (105:28 - 105:31)
and (105:30 - 105:35)
I almost never did it (105:31 - 105:35)
it's just annoying (105:35 - 105:41)
uh yeah they're they're when they've (105:38 - 105:43)
increased animations it was so great but (105:41 - 105:45)
then it made me realize like (105:43 - 105:47)
oh there are other animations that I (105:45 - 105:49)
think are way way worse than the things (105:47 - 105:53)
you sped up like feeding berries and uh (105:49 - 105:57)
evolving Pokemon is is also a huge pain (105:53 - 106:00)
still yeah it's fine though hey but we (105:57 - 106:01)
got extra extra small and extra extra (106:00 - 106:04)
large why would we complain these fees (106:01 - 106:06)
are new Metals too they're gonna work (106:04 - 106:07)
towards those Metals by catching (106:06 - 106:09)
poochiana (106:07 - 106:09)
it's all great well I think that's the (106:10 - 106:14)
end of our show uh hopefully you guys (106:12 - 106:16)

videos out podcast series done if you (108:03 - 108:09)

apology if you're listening to the gym (108:09 - 108:15)
leader one we do talk about the team (108:12 - 108:16)
star (108:15 - 108:20)
reveal in the gym leader one so I didn't (108:16 - 108:22)
really think of it at the time but if (108:20 - 108:23)
you skipped all of teamstar and went (108:22 - 108:25)
right to the gym leader one uh there are (108:23 - 108:27)

apology on that (108:27 - 108:30)

I would prefer like ideally in my head I (108:30 - 108:34)
was like oh you're gonna listen to him (108:33 - 108:36)
in this order but I didn't think of (108:34 - 108:38)
people being like I'm gonna listen to (108:36 - 108:39)
Titans and then skip team star and (108:38 - 108:40)
listen to gym leaders and then go back (108:39 - 108:42)
to team star so there's there's some (108:40 - 108:44)
team star spoilers in the gym leader (108:42 - 108:47)
