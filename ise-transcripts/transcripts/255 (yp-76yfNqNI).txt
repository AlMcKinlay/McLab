copyrighted what a world we live in we (3:11 - 3:17)
doing they say that alternate version of (3:15 - 3:21)
it it is your birthday the whole world (3:17 - 3:27)
you were living it's all this is what (3:21 - 3:29)
happens now is good man music in every (3:27 - 3:32)
episode this is what it comes to let me (3:29 - 3:35)
let me tell you what Mike and I did last (3:32 - 3:40)
night oh boy we we played some we (3:35 - 3:43)
watched an episode of Seinfeld as well (3:40 - 3:45)
as we do when we're always together (3:43 - 3:47)
correct ah this house for you at were (3:45 - 3:50)
you at your house or your house your (3:47 - 3:52)
house your house now you weren't at my (3:50 - 3:56)
hair Jesus where we're at my house with (3:52 - 3:57)
the goal of the night was to get (3:56 - 4:01)
together and play some switch games all (3:57 - 4:03)
the switch while the switch hammers were (4:01 - 4:05)
gonna get together in their super switch (4:03 - 4:07)
club and place which together and be (4:05 - 4:09)
like look I can take my switch from my (4:07 - 4:11)
house to your house and play switch at (4:09 - 4:14)
your house I'm so stuck on your joy cons (4:11 - 4:16)
with my joy comes the best part of last (4:14 - 4:18)
night as we watch the seinfeld episode (4:16 - 4:21)
called the switch that's true we did (4:18 - 4:25)
okay so people aren't the worst so yeah (4:21 - 4:27)
the seinfeld is is for the worst type of (4:25 - 4:30)
people so we played snipper clips (4:27 - 4:33)
snipper Clippers never credible snapper (4:30 - 4:36)
claps I came to the conclusion because I (4:33 - 4:38)
also stream that earlier in the day that (4:36 - 4:40)
Irene hates that game she definitely (4:38 - 4:42)
said more than once when we were playing (4:40 - 4:45)
it I hate this game which she didn't say (4:42 - 4:46)
at all during (4:45 - 4:48)
the stream she blamed a lot of it on the (4:46 - 4:51)
controller but I feel like it was just (4:48 - 4:52)
touching the wall which makes the (4:51 - 4:56)
controller inputs not work which casting (4:52 - 4:57)
you don't want to say while you're (4:56 - 4:59)
playing the game that you hate the game (4:57 - 5:01)
that's true otherwise what is the (4:59 - 5:02)
incentive for people to watch I mean if (5:01 - 5:04)
you go back and watch a stream and I'll (5:02 - 5:06)
put it on YouTube there's moments of (5:04 - 5:08)
frustration with both of us which i (5:06 - 5:11)
think that the game like i'm gerry Thank (5:08 - 5:12)
You Nagaina too that's what it's (5:11 - 5:14)
supposed to do right communication and (5:12 - 5:17)
stuff oh yeah I popped into a friend's (5:14 - 5:19)
stream who was it was a couple and they (5:17 - 5:22)
were streaming it to separate from you (5:19 - 5:25)
guys and they were struggling through (5:22 - 5:27)
many of the puzzles and it was very (5:25 - 5:29)
infuriating were they just screaming at (5:27 - 5:31)
each other did they get to that point no (5:29 - 5:33)
there were definitely points where the (5:31 - 5:35)
lake I could tell that if they weren't (5:33 - 5:37)
on camera in front of people they (5:35 - 5:41)
probably would have been fighting but I (5:37 - 5:44)
feel like they didn't let fly on Air I (5:41 - 5:46)
feel like that would have been my stream (5:44 - 5:48)
too I was just like uh there's a point (5:46 - 5:52)
where I'm trying to tell Irene to do (5:48 - 5:54)
something and she's she's not listening (5:52 - 5:58)
and then I'm trying to explain it and (5:54 - 6:00)
she's like will you just explain it and (5:58 - 6:02)
I was like I'm trying to but you keep it (6:00 - 6:04)
arresting me all right let me translate (6:02 - 6:06)
that for the listeners as I've played (6:04 - 6:09)
video games with Steve before the thing (6:06 - 6:12)
is if you're playing a game not in the (6:09 - 6:14)
way that Steve wants you to play the (6:12 - 6:16)
game then he thinks you're playing the (6:14 - 6:18)
game wrong that is so untrue will (6:16 - 6:20)
already one hundred percent current will (6:18 - 6:23)
always paint this bad picture of me (6:20 - 6:25)
because you're horrible I'm extremely (6:23 - 6:28)
helpful in video games and Micah can (6:25 - 6:31)
vouch for that as I spent countless (6:28 - 6:33)
nights in a single week staying up till (6:31 - 6:37)
4am helping him gauges year to destiny (6:33 - 6:39)
garbage that isn't even worth anything (6:37 - 6:43)
anymore right it was it was a trooper (6:39 - 6:46)
and I appreciated it until they announce (6:43 - 6:48)
destiny 2 and then now I don't care (6:46 - 6:50)
anymore guess who's a happy one here (6:48 - 6:52)
hidden waste his time on all that (6:50 - 6:55)
destiny star all the time isn't even (6:52 - 6:56)
really what I care about is the money (6:55 - 6:57)
that I was (6:56 - 7:00)
it okay so somebody could conversations (6:57 - 7:03)
happening so we did snipper clips again (7:00 - 7:05)
then we moved on to one to switch I (7:03 - 7:08)
posted a pretty long thing in in slack (7:05 - 7:11)
of my feelings of one to switch pretty (7:08 - 7:12)
much I just don't think it's worth the (7:11 - 7:14)
fifty dollars and this is coming from (7:12 - 7:17)
somebody who bought we play wii sports (7:14 - 7:20)
resort nitendo and I all I I even though (7:17 - 7:22)
those games were kind of shallow like I (7:20 - 7:24)
felt like I didn't waste my fifty (7:22 - 7:26)
dollars like i felt like i got fifty (7:24 - 7:27)
dollars worth of fun out of those games (7:26 - 7:29)
but those games weren't fifty dollars (7:27 - 7:32)
were they nutella landlords came with it (7:29 - 7:35)
wii sports resort came with a wiimote (7:32 - 7:37)
plus or whatever and that was like 50 (7:35 - 7:40)
bucks that's true at the wiimote with it (7:37 - 7:42)
like they were all fairly discounted (7:40 - 7:45)
from whatever land was 50 unless you got (7:42 - 7:48)
it with the deluxe edition right and it (7:45 - 7:50)
came with a guy which is how i feel i (7:48 - 7:54)
would feel less scornful i guess about (7:50 - 7:57)
my purchase of one to switch if it had (7:54 - 7:59)
come with the system and had been like (7:57 - 8:02)
part of like bundled into it it should (7:59 - 8:04)
have been introductory software it (8:02 - 8:05)
shouldn't have been a fifty-dollar game (8:04 - 8:07)
a full price 50 other game so after (8:05 - 8:10)
Steve explains why he doesn't think one (8:07 - 8:12)
two switches worth fifty dollars i'm (8:10 - 8:13)
going to posit a question but but (8:12 - 8:15)
complete your thoughts sir no i'm not (8:13 - 8:17)
gonna explain that i explained it's like (8:15 - 8:19)
that's all I'm saying yeah I don't have (8:17 - 8:21)
to read that come on give me the I don't (8:19 - 8:24)
want to dwell on the one to switch okay (8:21 - 8:26)
so in the water switch all right hold on (8:24 - 8:28)
so after 12 switch we're getting back to (8:26 - 8:30)
the initial point of the conversation of (8:28 - 8:32)
what Mike and I ended up doing which is (8:30 - 8:36)
first we ended up looking at terrible (8:32 - 8:40)
ps4 themes that cost money dynamic (8:36 - 8:42)
themes that cost money that were clearly (8:40 - 8:45)
made by who who knows but they were (8:42 - 8:48)
awful and then that somehow went down a (8:45 - 8:52)
rabbit hole of oh I ok I remember what (8:48 - 8:55)
started it so when Micah and I and Irene (8:52 - 8:56)
originally watched the two first two (8:55 - 8:59)
episodes of the sun and moon anime see (8:56 - 9:01)
it all comes back to Pokemon we watched (8:59 - 9:04)
them on YouTube some pirated version (9:01 - 9:07)
which which had no English theme song so (9:04 - 9:10)
I was very definitely watch them lose (9:07 - 9:11)
legit we want (9:10 - 9:15)
legit versions of them nope nope then (9:11 - 9:18)
since disney XD has shown those and my (9:15 - 9:21)
playstation view records those episodes (9:18 - 9:23)
I was like Oh Myka I listened to the sun (9:21 - 9:26)
and moon theme song here it is and so I (9:23 - 9:27)
pulled that up we watched it because we (9:26 - 9:30)
were already on my playstation and i (9:27 - 9:32)
still think the sun and moon theme song (9:30 - 9:35)
not catchy not good I on the other hand (9:32 - 9:38)
felt that it was amazing I really liked (9:35 - 9:41)
it said I I said I like this better than (9:38 - 9:43)
I feel like I've liked any of the (9:41 - 9:47)
previous ones aside from like the couple (9:43 - 9:51)
early ones and so then then we watched a (9:47 - 9:53)
15-minute YouTube video of all the (9:51 - 9:56)
pokemon songs back to back theme songs (9:53 - 9:58)
joto has some really good songs they're (9:56 - 10:01)
all good and then it's like this journey (9:58 - 10:05)
of there's one like kind of nickelback (10:01 - 10:10)
II kind of vocals and they like kind of (10:05 - 10:12)
let that guy go and then they brought in (10:10 - 10:15)
this female artist and she's got a (10:12 - 10:17)
really amazing voice it's like powerful (10:15 - 10:19)
whatever and then they brought the other (10:17 - 10:20)
guy back but they're like you got a (10:19 - 10:22)
match with her so then they were to do (10:20 - 10:25)
it it was like the history of pokemon (10:22 - 10:28)
theme song singers the first seven (10:25 - 10:30)
seasons which I think are no I think (10:28 - 10:32)
it's the first six that are canto in (10:30 - 10:35)
johto and then you get to Hoenn which is (10:32 - 10:38)
it's very apparent that one all the (10:35 - 10:41)
Hoenn music is terrible except maybe the (10:38 - 10:45)
last season of Hoenn and the animation (10:41 - 10:49)
quality is really terrible compared to (10:45 - 10:51)
the animation quality before and after (10:49 - 10:54)
diamond and pearl wasn't much better but (10:51 - 10:56)
then you go into diamond and pearl music (10:54 - 10:58)
and you're like this still isn't good (10:56 - 10:59)
but by the end of diamond pearl was like (10:58 - 11:01)
all right we're getting back to like (10:59 - 11:03)
Christian rock bands i was gonna say i (11:01 - 11:05)
didn't want to say anything cuz i don't (11:03 - 11:06)
want to offend anybody's faith although (11:05 - 11:08)
i don't know that that necessarily fens (11:06 - 11:10)
anybody's faith no I Christian Roddy's (11:08 - 11:13)
of those like that things sound to me (11:10 - 11:17)
yet like New Age Christian rock yeah I (11:13 - 11:19)
mean crate you can you can honestly say (11:17 - 11:22)
that that within the genre of Christian (11:19 - 11:24)
rock that there is a particular sound (11:22 - 11:24)
that (11:24 - 11:27)
is more prevalent than than other (11:24 - 11:29)
variations I mean you don't hear a lot (11:27 - 11:32)
of Christian rock that you would compare (11:29 - 11:35)
to like LCD soundsystem that there's a (11:32 - 11:39)
wide divergence fair enough I guess what (11:35 - 11:41)
I'm saying is I don't like it you don't (11:39 - 11:44)
like Christian rock I'm not a fan of (11:41 - 11:46)
Christian rock look I'm however I don't (11:44 - 11:48)
religious at all and there there's an (11:46 - 11:50)
animal theme like Christian (11:48 - 11:52)
quote-unquote rock bands that I have (11:50 - 11:54)
enjoyed throughout the years well okay I (11:52 - 11:57)
there I guess I could say that there are (11:54 - 12:01)
some but it it's not like man we're (11:57 - 12:03)
getting into some conversations here (12:01 - 12:06)
it's not like in your face I guess I (12:03 - 12:08)
think the thing about like Christian (12:06 - 12:11)
rock music is it's it it doesn't sound (12:08 - 12:13)
like that the Christian rock that I have (12:11 - 12:15)
liked does not sound like the Pokemon (12:13 - 12:18)
themes the poet the Christian rock music (12:15 - 12:19)
that sounds like the Pokemon themes is (12:18 - 12:21)
Christian mission rock music that I (12:19 - 12:24)
don't like so ultimately what you all (12:21 - 12:26)
agree on is it's a whole new world we (12:24 - 12:28)
live in is possibly the best pokemon (12:26 - 12:30)
theme song of all time that sounds (12:28 - 12:32)
really good give me that surrender moon (12:30 - 12:36)
theme on loop also high a lot of people (12:32 - 12:40)
keep asking me this on Twitter until sun (12:36 - 12:43)
and moon officially becomes available on (12:40 - 12:45)
disney XD i will not see it it isn't (12:43 - 12:49)
work together I when did they air I they (12:45 - 12:53)
aired februari eighth and tenth I think (12:49 - 12:54)
they've only have the two first episodes (12:53 - 12:56)
because my view recorded it off disney (12:54 - 13:00)
XD i keep doing a search on the like (12:56 - 13:04)
intelligent search by title on my DVR so (13:00 - 13:06)
i can add it to my recording and I comes (13:04 - 13:08)
at the only pokemon that's available is (13:06 - 13:12)
replays of pokemon XY yeah i have a lot (13:08 - 13:14)
of sexting is i don't know enough about (13:12 - 13:19)
this is disney XD named disney XD to (13:14 - 13:23)
like mimic the emoticon face of like (13:19 - 13:27)
wall-e kenji potentially so yes okay cuz (13:23 - 13:29)
that's all i hear any time anybody says (13:27 - 13:31)
it no that's what I thought too so black (13:29 - 13:33)
and white also I feel has good music (13:31 - 13:36)
will what are your opinions about this (13:33 - 13:38)
yet no I agree one hundred percent I (13:36 - 13:40)
I very thematically enjoyed black the (13:38 - 13:42)
black and white theme song and maybe the (13:40 - 13:44)
YouTube video didn't have everything but (13:42 - 13:48)
x and y was just a remix of the original (13:44 - 13:50)
theme song I was getting into that yeah (13:48 - 13:53)
that was good also I think there is a (13:50 - 13:56)
season in diamond and pearl that also (13:53 - 13:58)
remixes the original theme song like (13:56 - 14:00)
they do it a couple times throughout the (13:58 - 14:04)
20-plus seasons of Pokemon but yeah we (14:00 - 14:06)
should we should have we should do one (14:04 - 14:08)
of those like long episodes where we (14:06 - 14:10)
where we listen to all the theme songs (14:08 - 14:13)
and then rank them and analyze them and (14:10 - 14:16)
analyze have to have a four hour episode (14:13 - 14:18)
for special guests only where we have a (14:16 - 14:21)
discussion of every pokemon theme song (14:18 - 14:25)
ever I will bring examples of Christian (14:21 - 14:27)
rock new-age Christian rock music for my (14:25 - 14:31)
understanding you are allowed to play (14:27 - 14:35)
copyrighted audio legally as long as (14:31 - 14:37)
you're doing it to critique and or (14:35 - 14:40)
evaluate it fair use I think it's like (14:37 - 14:41)
no I don't think I don't think it's (14:40 - 14:43)
unfair use I think it's be I don't think (14:41 - 14:46)
it's the fair use clause thing or (14:43 - 14:47)
whatever I think it's something to do (14:46 - 14:51)
with review purposes oh isn't it like an (14:47 - 14:53)
amount of it there's there's a lot of (14:51 - 14:55)
vagaries in this law but I have access (14:53 - 14:57)
to resources that can give us very good (14:55 - 14:59)
guidance on what is and is not possible (14:57 - 15:01)
they're like that's why because there (14:59 - 15:03)
was there's a big this is off topic not (15:01 - 15:05)
that we have been on topic there was a (15:03 - 15:07)
big threat of like hey can i play songs (15:05 - 15:10)
in my podcast and people were like no (15:07 - 15:12)
those are copyrighted unless you have a (15:10 - 15:14)
list you have permission or whatever you (15:12 - 15:15)
can't do that they're like well what if (15:14 - 15:17)
I just do 15 seconds like that's fair (15:15 - 15:19)
use right and they're like no that (15:17 - 15:20)
doesn't apply like that's still somebody (15:19 - 15:22)
song and they're like well how does this (15:20 - 15:24)
movie podcast do it and it's like (15:22 - 15:25)
they're not playing it for people's (15:24 - 15:27)
enjoyment they're playing it to then (15:25 - 15:30)
talk about and evaluate the thing at (15:27 - 15:33)
hand and that's why it's okay here okay (15:30 - 15:36)
yeah as all right it's whatever okay so (15:33 - 15:38)
Pokemon music can we get back to my (15:36 - 15:40)
question yes I mean we're digging deep (15:38 - 15:42)
back into the conversation again okay (15:40 - 15:45)
but friday night i was at a bar with and (15:42 - 15:47)
it wasn't like a crowded bar so not (15:45 - 15:50)
crowded bar with four of my friends pink (15:47 - 15:51)
for gin (15:50 - 15:53)
from the previous episode was there uh (15:51 - 15:56)
so he'll probably remember for me but (15:53 - 15:58)
anyways my friend John showed up and he (15:56 - 16:00)
brought his switch with the two joy cons (15:58 - 16:03)
can choose a bar to the bar it wasn't a (16:00 - 16:05)
crowded bar you it was not a crowded bar (16:03 - 16:07)
and it's actually a bar where they have (16:05 - 16:10)
a wii u hooked up for that people can (16:07 - 16:14)
rent to play games and stuff oh ok but (16:10 - 16:17)
like the four of us were or five of us (16:14 - 16:20)
when John showed up were at a table you (16:17 - 16:21)
know not a lot of people around or (16:20 - 16:23)
anything like that and it was getting (16:21 - 16:25)
kind of dull just sitting there drinking (16:23 - 16:28)
beer and talking about how nerdy we all (16:25 - 16:31)
are would that have been a decent (16:28 - 16:34)
opportunity to play one to switch I (16:31 - 16:37)
think that there yeah I was saying I (16:34 - 16:39)
think that they're good like as long as (16:37 - 16:41)
you're in a group that's willing to play (16:39 - 16:43)
some games I feel like it's pretty (16:41 - 16:45)
accessible to anybody I would say no (16:43 - 16:47)
only because if you're in a restaurant (16:45 - 16:50)
like if I'm in a restaurant or a bar I (16:47 - 16:51)
guess while bar serves drinks and food (16:50 - 16:54)
it could be classified as a public (16:51 - 16:59)
setting of food drink taking place any (16:54 - 17:01)
time somebody's like watching a YouTube (16:59 - 17:03)
video or something with audio on their (17:01 - 17:04)
phone at the table across from me I'm (17:03 - 17:06)
instantly annoyed I feel like that's (17:04 - 17:08)
different in a bar setting though yeah (17:06 - 17:11)
let me make this clear number one all (17:08 - 17:14)
all DC bars are required to serve food (17:11 - 17:17)
so we can't really hold that to any (17:14 - 17:19)
crazy there's like literally only one (17:17 - 17:21)
bar in DC that's allowed to not serve (17:19 - 17:23)
food but our table where we were sitting (17:21 - 17:26)
was like right behind the pool tables so (17:23 - 17:28)
it was pretty much just like us sitting (17:26 - 17:30)
in a corner and like three pool tables (17:28 - 17:33)
around us separating you from it I get (17:30 - 17:34)
what you're saying Steve if we were at (17:33 - 17:36)
dennys and somebody broke out a switch (17:34 - 17:38)
and certain point what to switch I (17:36 - 17:40)
probably would be pretty upset but I (17:38 - 17:44)
feel great Christopher then upset I in (17:40 - 17:46)
my head I would say are you kidding me (17:44 - 17:48)
right now and then I would and then I (17:46 - 17:50)
would probably just eat my food and that (17:48 - 17:52)
would be the end of it but in a bar (17:50 - 17:54)
setting I could definitely see that as (17:52 - 17:55)
long as you and your friends are okay (17:54 - 17:58)
with embarrassing yourself in public oh (17:55 - 18:00)
absolutely i mean we were like eat for (17:58 - 18:03)
three years in at that point in time so (18:00 - 18:04)
that's like prime (18:03 - 18:07)
you like you're ready at that point for (18:04 - 18:09)
someone to switch all right all right (18:07 - 18:11)
I'll keep that to do a lot of waving (18:09 - 18:13)
your arms around and I mean it may be (18:11 - 18:16)
dangerous for the for the bar but now it (18:13 - 18:18)
yeah it wasn't it wasn't crowded then we (18:16 - 18:19)
were sitting in the section where if (18:18 - 18:22)
somebody had rented the wii u umm that's (18:19 - 18:23)
where they would have been i see well i (18:22 - 18:26)
had a pokemon snap story but i'll save (18:23 - 18:29)

million battle points if not more oh so (22:37 - 22:43)
guess what just sign up talk to that rep (22:40 - 22:46)
kit okay can you not by heavy balls in (22:43 - 22:49)

nothing and you've already won no no I'm (22:51 - 22:56)
just I was gonna apply the whole I hate (22:54 - 22:58)
that they're getting these kids content (22:56 - 23:02)
behind this I would argue more like what (22:58 - 23:05)
why a heavy ball but why why is it not (23:02 - 23:07)
like five heavy balls why is it not ten (23:05 - 23:09)
heavy balls like why it's just rather (23:07 - 23:13)
one single heavy ball uh it's is this (23:09 - 23:16)
I'm out of loop on this and I fill me (23:13 - 23:18)
and if you know how many of these have (23:16 - 23:19)
they actually completed because I (23:18 - 23:22)
remember early on like nobody was they (23:19 - 23:23)
weren't getting completed on this is the (23:22 - 23:28)
fourth one the first two failed okay so (23:23 - 23:30)
the the one before this they passed yes (23:28 - 23:34)
that was the that was the trading over (23:30 - 23:39)
the GTS okay one before that was the QR (23:34 - 23:42)
codes and the one before that was was it (23:39 - 23:45)
trading catching I think about a ching (23:42 - 23:48)
like the first one was yeah catching (23:45 - 23:51)
wild Pokemon yeah and I think the (23:48 - 23:52)
problem with the first one is people (23:51 - 23:54)
just didn't know they had to talk to the (23:52 - 23:57)
lady first before they started the (23:54 - 23:59)
catching oh well I didn't know that so (23:57 - 24:04)

all scenes from the very first episode (24:44 - 24:50)
of Pokemon just remade in widescreen and (24:47 - 24:52)
not 20 years old I have not watched yet (24:50 - 24:54)

they said was the the whole scene with (24:54 - 24:59)
it dropping a rainbow wing down to ash (24:57 - 25:02)
and yeah I eat that first episode was (24:59 - 25:06)
you know what 22 minutes this movie is (25:02 - 25:08)
probably going to be a hundred minutes (25:06 - 25:12)
or 70 or 80 minutes I think most pokemon (25:08 - 25:15)
movies are like 70 or 80 minutes so I (25:12 - 25:18)
don't have 90 minutes they're not 90 so (25:15 - 25:20)
it's either 70 80 or 100 it's a world of (25:18 - 25:23)
know 90s yeah world of know 90s okay I (25:20 - 25:24)
can't remember a Pokemon movie actually (25:23 - 25:27)
more than 80 minutes long but but I (25:24 - 25:29)
could be wrong I could be wrong I guess (25:27 - 25:31)
I'm everything they showed was from the (25:29 - 25:33)
first episode so I'm I guess I'm just (25:31 - 25:37)
curious of where where that where they (25:33 - 25:38)
take that I don't I don't think it's bad (25:37 - 25:39)
I'm actually excited that they're (25:38 - 25:41)
redoing that I'm just curious of what (25:39 - 25:45)

during the Polka mania okay yeah prime (29:52 - 29:59)
age 26 you have a football career you're (29:56 - 30:04)
now with NXT you're a gamer how you're (29:59 - 30:05)
you're a dad (30:04 - 30:09)
of two kids double dead yeah how do you (30:05 - 30:11)
fit all that in in life how have you (30:09 - 30:13)
done so much it's such a young age I (30:11 - 30:16)
guess is the question oh I set this goal (30:13 - 30:18)
for myself that I just want to do you (30:16 - 30:20)
know every every cool job that I ever (30:18 - 30:23)
wanted to do as a kid so right now I'm (30:20 - 30:26)
two for two and are they like three for (30:23 - 30:30)
three dads a job so real you know it's (30:26 - 30:32)
just it's all about compartmentalizing (30:30 - 30:34)
your time you can't dedicate too much to (30:32 - 30:35)
one thing or the other thing but just (30:34 - 30:38)
really focus on the thing you want to do (30:35 - 30:40)
when you've got time to do it (30:38 - 30:43)
unfortunately yeah the whole gaming is (30:40 - 30:47)
taking a bit of a back seat but handheld (30:43 - 30:49)
games are actually great for me because (30:47 - 30:50)
I can play them on the road and I can (30:49 - 30:53)
play them without my kids aren't allowed (30:50 - 30:56)
to watch TV yet so I can't you know play (30:53 - 30:58)
TV games while they're awake but I can (30:56 - 31:00)
play you know a DS game when they're (30:58 - 31:02)
around and just act like I'm on my phone (31:00 - 31:06)
ok let's talk about just growing up I (31:02 - 31:11)
was gaming a big part of that it was the (31:06 - 31:14)
biggest I always from when I was a (31:11 - 31:16)
little kid I guess the story the story (31:14 - 31:20)
of my descent into just awfulness is my (31:16 - 31:22)
dad played professional football before (31:20 - 31:25)
me played for 11 years for the Patriots (31:22 - 31:27)
the Jets and the Seahawks and back then (31:25 - 31:29)
they would go to training camp and they (31:27 - 31:31)
just kind of leave home and they'd be (31:29 - 31:33)
gone for a couple months for the summer (31:31 - 31:37)
and when he left I remember one summer (31:33 - 31:38)
vividly that he came but he would always (31:37 - 31:41)
come back with a gift and at the time I (31:38 - 31:43)
was really big into like Godzilla movies (31:41 - 31:47)
and Power Rangers so he brought back a (31:43 - 31:50)
dragon ball z one of those I don't know (31:47 - 31:52)
if you remember those box sets that if (31:50 - 31:53)
you put them all together they make a (31:52 - 31:56)
picture yeah yeah like one of those and (31:53 - 31:59)
then it was all anime and video games (31:56 - 32:01)
and everything downhill for the rest of (31:59 - 32:03)
my life ok so that that's that's what (32:01 - 32:06)
sparked the interest that's what sparked (32:03 - 32:08)
it yeah with somebody who had a father (32:06 - 32:11)
in professional football was was he cool (32:08 - 32:14)
with the whole video game thing or was (32:11 - 32:16)
it hey no you need to go outside you (32:14 - 32:18)
need to play sports stopping in the (32:16 - 32:19)
house will (32:18 - 32:21)
was there any tension like that or well (32:19 - 32:22)
I mean that's kind of the whole (32:21 - 32:24)
compartmentalizing thing I kind of got (32:22 - 32:26)
it from that point because I'd I mean (32:24 - 32:28)
I've always played football since I (32:26 - 32:30)
actually went into withdrawal last year (32:28 - 32:31)
because it was the first year since I (32:30 - 32:35)
was eight that I didn't so um there was (32:31 - 32:37)
a football was always around and then (32:35 - 32:40)
whenever I had time between football and (32:37 - 32:42)
school I could always play video games (32:40 - 32:44)
and do stuff like that my dad is a big (32:42 - 32:47)
tech guy not necessarily video games or (32:44 - 32:48)
anything like that but he was all about (32:47 - 32:51)
getting the newest tech stuff yeah I (32:48 - 32:54)
always had pretty up-to-date video game (32:51 - 32:56)
consoles and stuff like that where does (32:54 - 32:59)
the love of Pokemon fit in as soon as I (32:56 - 33:02)
saw the first commercial on it must have (32:59 - 33:04)
been like cartoon network in the late (33:02 - 33:07)
90s for red and blue I saw it and I was (33:04 - 33:08)
like wow that looks really cool and I (33:07 - 33:13)
got on it and safer maybe I don't think (33:08 - 33:15)
I played it in college so i think i (33:13 - 33:18)
missed black and white but um i think (33:15 - 33:20)
i've played just about everything else (33:18 - 33:23)
from there Wow and I'm not I'm not one (33:20 - 33:26)
of these you know oh yeah I used to play (33:23 - 33:28)
first generation I play competitive (33:26 - 33:32)
stuff with my EVs and my IVs and my (33:28 - 33:35)
breeding and all that so I'm the realest (33:32 - 33:39)
fake nerd ever before we go really heavy (33:35 - 33:41)
on the pokemon stuff just getting these (33:39 - 33:44)
questions of the way how did you get (33:41 - 33:46)
into football was it because uh the (33:44 - 33:48)
football career i should say was it (33:46 - 33:50)
because of your dad or was it just (33:48 - 33:52)
something that you were passionate about (33:50 - 33:54)
growing up and then to follow up that (33:52 - 33:56)
question how did that football career (33:54 - 33:59)
transition into pro wrestling uh well (33:56 - 34:01)
when I was a kid I always wanted to do (33:59 - 34:04)
exactly what my dad did so at some point (34:01 - 34:07)
my dad had retired and he's now and (34:04 - 34:10)
became a financial advisor so I always (34:07 - 34:12)
said when I was little I was like I'm (34:10 - 34:14)
going to be a pro football player and (34:12 - 34:16)
then I'm gonna retire and be a financial (34:14 - 34:18)
advisor so I kind of always just it was (34:16 - 34:20)
he came naturally and I was good at it (34:18 - 34:23)
so football was just always football for (34:20 - 34:27)
me and but towards I think I started (34:23 - 34:29)
watching wrestling when I was (34:27 - 34:33)
maybe in middle school so after after at (34:29 - 34:35)
some point I started noticing I was like (34:33 - 34:37)
oh I'm big enough to be like one of (34:35 - 34:39)
these guys I can I could probably do (34:37 - 34:41)
this maybe because I'm not good with (34:39 - 34:43)
numbers I'm pretty awful at math I (34:41 - 34:46)
shouldn't be a financial advisor maybe (34:43 - 34:48)
after I retire from football after (34:46 - 34:50)
however many years I'll become a (34:48 - 34:51)
professional wrestler because that would (34:50 - 34:53)
be really cool and then I never have to (34:51 - 34:57)
get a desk job right so um yeah i mean (34:53 - 35:00)
the plan the plan has literally always (34:57 - 35:01)
been to play football as long as (35:00 - 35:04)
possible and then move on to wrestling (35:01 - 35:06)
because football is kind of football is (35:04 - 35:10)
very safe in terms of a career path and (35:06 - 35:13)
I knew people that were in it so I was (35:10 - 35:14)
much more comfortable in that (35:13 - 35:17)
environment but when it became time to (35:14 - 35:20)
move on and do something else wrestling (35:17 - 35:22)
was you know it was a leap of faith that (35:20 - 35:25)
ended up working out for me and so while (35:22 - 35:27)
you're while you're doing all this the (35:25 - 35:29)
video game things kind of obviously (35:27 - 35:31)
stuck and stayed I saw I saw you dead (35:29 - 35:34)
you did some YouTube stuff with the the (35:31 - 35:35)
channel the third wheel and you've done (35:34 - 35:37)
some other stuff you have a twitch (35:35 - 35:39)
channel so is that something you're I (35:37 - 35:42)
don't want to like bring up Austin (35:39 - 35:45)
Xavier woods Austin Creed but he does so (35:42 - 35:47)
much you he does so much video game (35:45 - 35:49)
stuff whether that's on twitch or (35:47 - 35:52)
YouTube or up up down down but do you (35:49 - 35:54)
see yourself going down that same kind (35:52 - 35:56)
of path or is it just a passion you have (35:54 - 35:58)
that you don't feel too you don't need (35:56 - 36:01)
to you know put out there as much as (35:58 - 36:04)
maybe I'll totally I've always wanted to (36:01 - 36:07)
that like I have a youtube channel that (36:04 - 36:09)
I got a bunch of subscribers and I just (36:07 - 36:11)
feel bad because I just never had the (36:09 - 36:13)
time to actually put stuff on it and I (36:11 - 36:15)
have a twitch channel but I just never (36:13 - 36:17)
have time to sit down and you know (36:15 - 36:19)
stream for a certain amount of time like (36:17 - 36:21)
that actually the whole up up down down (36:19 - 36:23)
thing and I'm actually friends with (36:21 - 36:26)
Austin from when I played football so (36:23 - 36:30)
though that whole thing is actually the (36:26 - 36:32)
perfect excuse to make because that's (36:30 - 36:35)
work that's for the company so yeah I (36:32 - 36:37)
can make you know I can make my hobby (36:35 - 36:40)
work and we're in the process of doing (36:37 - 36:42)
some pretty cool stuff hopefully I'm (36:40 - 36:43)
going to be more and more (36:42 - 36:45)
are involved in up up down down at least (36:43 - 36:48)
around the WWE Performance Center in (36:45 - 36:51)
Orlando because it's almost like its (36:48 - 36:53)
main roster guys don't have a home base (36:51 - 36:56)
and in NXT we are all based in Orlando (36:53 - 36:59)
so everybody comes through orlando even (36:56 - 37:02)
if their main roster guys if they just (36:59 - 37:03)
want to work out or they need to get a (37:02 - 37:05)
little extra training in or whatever so (37:03 - 37:07)
it's actually a really if we could set (37:05 - 37:08)
up something down here it would be (37:07 - 37:10)
really cool if we could you know just (37:08 - 37:13)
use that as a hub for that channel so (37:10 - 37:15)
i'm going to hopefully be involved in (37:13 - 37:18)
that going forward backing up a little (37:15 - 37:20)
bit let's let's talk about games (37:18 - 37:23)
specifically favorite pokemon game and (37:20 - 37:25)
then following that favorite non pokemon (37:23 - 37:27)
game favorite pokemon game i'm (37:25 - 37:30)
definitely a gen 3 baby really yeah I (37:27 - 37:32)
was always I don't know what it was (37:30 - 37:35)
about it because I know like I know all (37:32 - 37:37)
the complaints about it but I don't know (37:35 - 37:40)
I just really maybe I think that gen 3 (37:37 - 37:43)
might have been the first Pokemon game (37:40 - 37:46)
that I actually read and understood the (37:43 - 37:48)
story okay it wasn't just like hitting x (37:46 - 37:51)
over and over and plowing through yeah (37:48 - 37:53)
and the red and blue I was a dumb kid (37:51 - 37:55)
and then actually silver and gold that (37:53 - 37:57)
goes back to my dad being the tech guy (37:55 - 38:00)
he actually got me those early but those (37:57 - 38:03)
were in Japanese so I didn't know what (38:00 - 38:04)
the story wasn't that because I couldn't (38:03 - 38:09)
read sure and there after that uh ruby (38:04 - 38:12)
sapphire emerald that was I guess that (38:09 - 38:13)
would have been lived that act now that (38:12 - 38:15)
I think about it that was the first time (38:13 - 38:17)
that I actually read and understood the (38:15 - 38:19)
story to a Pokemon game so I guess it (38:17 - 38:21)
has a little bit of a safe soft spot in (38:19 - 38:24)
my heart so were you one of the were you (38:21 - 38:26)
one of the fanboys that freaked out when (38:24 - 38:28)
they remade it for Omega Ruby alpha (38:26 - 38:31)
sapphire oh yeah of course just his you (38:28 - 38:33)
know it's the nostalgia factor and I try (38:31 - 38:34)
not to get caught up too much and (38:33 - 38:37)
nostalgia stuff but totally what about (38:34 - 38:40)
non pokemon game that's such a broad (38:37 - 38:41)
question there's so much out that (38:40 - 38:43)
Pokemon games just like yeah it's like (38:41 - 38:46)
asking her um I mean you could do it you (38:43 - 38:48)
could do a couple I think when we had (38:46 - 38:50)
Austin on he went with the he went with (38:48 - 38:54)
Sonic and I think final fantasy oh and I (38:50 - 38:55)
feel bad because I can't remember but (38:54 - 38:57)
well uh (38:55 - 38:59)
love and always I'm talking about the (38:57 - 39:01)
persona games and shin megami tensei (38:59 - 39:05)
series I love JRPGs I kind of just love (39:01 - 39:10)
the isn't it the JRPG thing where you're (39:05 - 39:11)
just a kid and then by the end of the (39:10 - 39:15)
game you're fighting some concept of God (39:11 - 39:17)
or something like yeah yeah yeah I'll (39:15 - 39:19)
save save a little of that kind of thing (39:17 - 39:23)
yeah Oh jade empire a bioware game kind (39:19 - 39:24)
of one of the lesser-known ones but it's (39:23 - 39:26)
actually what it's actually my favorite (39:24 - 39:30)
original xbox was that yes original xbox (39:26 - 39:32)
it was a it was still along the lines of (39:30 - 39:35)
a bioware like kind of good good choice (39:32 - 39:37)
bad choice neutral choice kind of thing (39:35 - 39:39)
yeah but it's based around like a kung (39:37 - 39:44)
fu movie almost and I always go back and (39:39 - 39:47)
play that um those are the big ones I (39:44 - 39:49)

from Kevin he is big fan of yours and (39:56 - 40:02)
big fan of its super fective and so well (39:59 - 40:04)
thank you Kevin he was actually one of (40:02 - 40:06)
the one of the many people who were (40:04 - 40:08)
suggested they're like hey you should (40:06 - 40:09)
get Brendan on and so I reached out to (40:08 - 40:11)
him and I was like hey well you're I (40:09 - 40:13)
know you're such a big fan of both of us (40:11 - 40:15)
what would you ask so he wrote in and he (40:13 - 40:18)
said dear SBJ and Brennan I've been a (40:15 - 40:20)
fan of the Shogun ever since he popped (40:18 - 40:21)
up on the friends cast quite a long time (40:20 - 40:24)
ago so I'm excited to see worlds collide (40:21 - 40:26)
after he shows up on my other beloved (40:24 - 40:28)
podcast it's super effective I cannot (40:26 - 40:30)
wait to hear the thoughts and the (40:28 - 40:32)
interview you to have he goes on and (40:30 - 40:34)
says Brennan I salute you for what you (40:32 - 40:36)
have accomplished tackling the NFL WWE (40:34 - 40:39)
fatherhood all while following pokemon (40:36 - 40:41)
other interests is amazing and even we (40:39 - 40:43)
are so close in age so it blows me away (40:41 - 40:46)
hats off to you SBJ props for you to (40:43 - 40:47)
putting in the work and making cool (40:46 - 40:49)
interviews like this happen you the (40:47 - 40:51)
effort you put into it super fective is (40:49 - 40:53)
unmatched and i think it shows how (40:51 - 40:55)
awesome people like brendan to take (40:53 - 40:57)
notice and join in my question for the (40:55 - 40:58)
sake of the interview if you had a (40:57 - 41:00)
wrestling persona based off a Pokemon (40:58 - 41:03)
who would you pick obviously ha lucha (41:00 - 41:04)
and in sinner or do not count as they (41:03 - 41:07)
are already wrestlers thanks for taking (41:04 - 41:09)
the time to read my email hope to see (41:07 - 41:11)
you both if you're in Atlanta sincerely (41:09 - 41:11)
Kevin (41:11 - 41:12)
well thank you for all the nice things (41:11 - 41:16)
Kevin but uh that's actually that's (41:12 - 41:17)
actually an easier question than you (41:16 - 41:20)
think because you also you didn't you (41:17 - 41:21)
eliminated halacha because that's an (41:20 - 41:25)
obvious one eliminated in sin Aurora (41:21 - 41:27)
because that's also an obvious one but (41:25 - 41:30)
emboar is actually if you look it up (41:27 - 41:33)
emboar looks and is heavily based on a (41:30 - 41:37)
great wrestler from the late 80s Early (41:33 - 41:39)
90s Bam Bam Bigelow really allow you to (41:37 - 41:42)
make me like em Bor because I've always (41:39 - 41:44)
not been the biggest fan of em Bor (41:42 - 41:46)
that's actually what did it for me and (41:44 - 41:48)
there's it's it's actually crazy i don't (41:46 - 41:50)
think i don't see it a lot in a lot of (41:48 - 41:55)
places but like there it's uncanny like (41:50 - 41:58)
he bambam has like this Harry had he's (41:55 - 42:00)
passed unfortunately but he had this um (41:58 - 42:03)
like full body suit that had these (42:00 - 42:06)
flames and this like big fire collar and (42:03 - 42:08)
stuff like that he look like an M bore (42:06 - 42:11)
he really did that would be that would (42:08 - 42:13)
be my answer for all right speaking of (42:11 - 42:17)
of wrestling Pokemon how how did you (42:13 - 42:20)
feel when I mean gen-6 and gen7 both (42:17 - 42:23)
both seemed like yesterday but how do (42:20 - 42:24)
you feel when you see pokemon like (42:23 - 42:27)
halloo chaa or in cinema or hanging out (42:24 - 42:30)
and and oh it's so it's so can lucha (42:27 - 42:32)
Pikachu and you can I think you could (42:30 - 42:35)
honestly put together of the set of six (42:32 - 42:37)
guys that are all wrestlers at this (42:35 - 42:40)
point if you throw in like Hariyama (42:37 - 42:42)
that's a sumo wrestler and the champ has (42:40 - 42:45)
the belt that is Machamp obviously is (42:42 - 42:47)
bodybuilder or a wrestler but you know (42:45 - 42:51)
it's close enough it's it's awesome (42:47 - 42:53)
actually I remember because I actually (42:51 - 42:56)
got the opportunity to do a video for (42:53 - 42:58)
the pokemon company this past year for (42:56 - 43:00)
the 20th anniversary for their YouTube (42:58 - 43:02)
channel you did I think I saw this you (43:00 - 43:05)
Eric yeah this is a story you got let's (43:02 - 43:08)
hear it um well basically they hit me up (43:05 - 43:10)
on Twitter and they're like hey you want (43:08 - 43:13)
to do a video for you know the 20th (43:10 - 43:15)
anniversary I'm like sure and they it (43:13 - 43:17)
was awesome they sent me a bunch of like (43:15 - 43:20)
plush toys for my daughter I only had (43:17 - 43:22)
one daughter at the time but she's she's (43:20 - 43:24)
like well often or Pokemon journey right (43:22 - 43:27)
she's got almost all of the Pikachu (43:24 - 43:30)
close at this point except for like the (43:27 - 43:32)
den a or something like that yeah (43:30 - 43:35)
anyways when I did that that was last (43:32 - 43:37)
year so I had just started wrestling or (43:35 - 43:39)
I was in my first couple of months of (43:37 - 43:43)
wrestling and when that went up I don't (43:39 - 43:45)
know if you remember the what were they (43:43 - 43:48)
the Chinese leaks for gen7 yeah yeah (43:45 - 43:51)
that ended up being true yes they're (43:48 - 43:53)
heavy debate on the internet that (43:51 - 43:56)
because they had Jordin Sparks do one (43:53 - 43:59)
who's a singer and then they had me do (43:56 - 44:01)
one that's a wrestler if they had (43:59 - 44:03)
somebody who was an archer do a (44:01 - 44:05)
testimonial then that would confirm that (44:03 - 44:08)
the Chinese were okay that's that's (44:05 - 44:10)
really funny actually yeah so they (44:08 - 44:12)
reached out to you that you they did the (44:10 - 44:15)
Pokemon thing was that was that like a (44:12 - 44:17)
dream come true of like whole like the (44:15 - 44:19)
pokemon company this this franchise that (44:17 - 44:21)
I've been following has recognized me (44:19 - 44:23)
and wants to collaborate absolutely it's (44:21 - 44:26)
like you I've gotten to this point where (44:23 - 44:30)
you know I can actually reach out to and (44:26 - 44:33)
I'm nothing and as a wrestler or even as (44:30 - 44:36)
a football player but I guess me being a (44:33 - 44:38)
huge losers you know gotten me far (44:36 - 44:40)
enough that I can reach out to you know (44:38 - 44:42)
people like the super best friends that (44:40 - 44:44)
I've been a fan of for a long time or (44:42 - 44:47)
the pokemon company even that and do (44:44 - 44:50)
stuff and work with them so it is kind (44:47 - 44:52)
of like I opening and you know I think I (44:50 - 44:54)
put up a tweet as soon as it happened I (44:52 - 44:55)
was like who would have thought that (44:54 - 44:57)
when that kid stole my gameboy and third (44:55 - 45:00)
grade that I'd be on the Pokemon chill (44:57 - 45:04)
for a little bit behind the curtain I (45:00 - 45:06)
when I when I heard so much about you (45:04 - 45:07)
and I followed you on twitter you (45:06 - 45:09)
followed me back instantly and i saw i (45:07 - 45:12)
don't i have to ask like was it because (45:09 - 45:14)
you saw that i hosted a pokemon podcast (45:12 - 45:15)
was it because you knew that it's super (45:14 - 45:17)
effective was the thing like where was (45:15 - 45:19)
the i saw that you hosted it's super (45:17 - 45:21)
effective and I actually do have a (45:19 - 45:24)
friend that if not currently still does (45:21 - 45:26)
but he definitely did follow the podcast (45:24 - 45:28)
so as soon as I saw that I was like oh (45:26 - 45:31)
cool it's always good to make these (45:28 - 45:33)
connections and I thought we got it (45:31 - 45:34)
worked out pretty quickly I think right (45:33 - 45:36)
yeah yeah totally that was like the same (45:34 - 45:37)
with with Austin I messaged him on (45:36 - 45:38)
Twitter and he like message (45:37 - 45:40)
back instantly and then like two weeks (45:38 - 45:42)
later I'm flying out to plan on sitting (45:40 - 45:44)
in his house and of his nervous is all (45:42 - 45:46)
yes that's me that's what happens when (45:44 - 45:48)
you're big time like Austin I'm just I'm (45:46 - 45:51)
sitting in my poverty studio in my car (45:48 - 45:56)
in my garage going back to Bachmann to (45:51 - 45:58)
have you are you caught up have you (45:56 - 46:00)
played Sun and Moon I have played yeah I (45:58 - 46:03)
played and beat Sun and Moon pretty (46:00 - 46:05)
quickly yeah pretty early on and I think (46:03 - 46:09)
I haven't been on terribly recently but (46:05 - 46:12)
i did i was on a lot when the pokemon (46:09 - 46:14)
bank opened up because i had a lot of (46:12 - 46:15)
guys that i need to transfer over and (46:14 - 46:17)
how did you feel about that whole game (46:15 - 46:19)
it's it's obviously moving in a (46:17 - 46:21)
different direction slightly different (46:19 - 46:24)
no gyms what whoa for somebody who's (46:21 - 46:26)
been with the franchise since generation (46:24 - 46:27)
one what are your what are your thoughts (46:26 - 46:29)
what are your likes you don't like i (46:27 - 46:32)
always think it's good especially you (46:29 - 46:34)
know Pokemon has basically been the same (46:32 - 46:38)
thing forever so any kind of innovation (46:34 - 46:40)
or anything for to me is completely (46:38 - 46:42)
welcome i think they did some really (46:40 - 46:45)
cool stuff i actually prefer the idea of (46:42 - 46:50)
z moves to mega evolutions at least like (46:45 - 46:52)
in a competitive standpoint just because (46:50 - 46:54)
I've all I've always at least (46:52 - 46:56)
competitively if I've always gone from (46:54 - 46:58)
like the mindset that you could use (46:56 - 47:01)
whoever the heck you want but you can't (46:58 - 47:04)
use girafarig if you know yet there is (47:01 - 47:06)
there's never going to be a girafarig (47:04 - 47:08)
mega evolution you know you know if you (47:06 - 47:10)
could put on you know cool move that's a (47:08 - 47:13)
anybody can have it I thought that (47:10 - 47:15)
really mix stuff up and it made you know (47:13 - 47:17)
teams less predictable and stuff like (47:15 - 47:19)
that so I I like the I like the (47:17 - 47:20)
direction that it's going and I hope (47:19 - 47:23)
they keep on in future games there in (47:20 - 47:25)
whatever may be the third game for (47:23 - 47:27)
generation seven might be they keep on (47:25 - 47:28)
innovating because I think that that's (47:27 - 47:30)
that's really honestly how you compete (47:28 - 47:32)
you can't rest on your laurels for that (47:30 - 47:34)
long you know anything that stood out (47:32 - 47:35)
that in gen seven that you didn't really (47:34 - 47:39)
care for um not particularly i mean like (47:35 - 47:41)
there's a lot of like little things like (47:39 - 47:43)
okay they've completely done away with (47:41 - 47:46)
like hm's and stuff like that but that's (47:43 - 47:48)
kind of needed to go for a while at this (47:46 - 47:51)
one yeah a lot of a lot of just like (47:48 - 47:52)
ease of (47:51 - 47:54)
life things that they've done well I (47:52 - 47:58)
really like what was the super training (47:54 - 48:01)
in x and y mm-hmm I thought that was (47:58 - 48:04)
really helpful and it was easier for me (48:01 - 48:06)
to keep track of stuff for that so maybe (48:04 - 48:08)
if I wish there was something more like (48:06 - 48:10)
that in gen 7 but aside from that I'm (48:08 - 48:14)
pretty yeah I'm pretty cool what are (48:10 - 48:16)
what are your thoughts on any of the (48:14 - 48:17)
spin-off games whether that's poking (48:16 - 48:19)
tournament pokemon snap pokemon pinball (48:17 - 48:22)
is that something you dabble in yeah I (48:19 - 48:24)
haven't I I should have played poker in (48:22 - 48:26)
tournament by now but I actually still (48:24 - 48:27)
haven't played poker tournament um (48:26 - 48:30)
pokemon snap was one of my favorite (48:27 - 48:32)
games when I was a kid I really loved in (48:30 - 48:34)
college i think it was called pokemon (48:32 - 48:36)
conquest which was pokemon basically (48:34 - 48:39)
crossed dynasty warriors mm-hmm which i (48:36 - 48:41)
was like what the what the heck when did (48:39 - 48:43)
they do this and I thought that game was (48:41 - 48:45)
a lot of fun so yeah I'm just a Pokemon (48:43 - 48:49)
fan so any kind of you know any other (48:45 - 48:51)
way I can consume it i'm completely (48:49 - 48:53)
willing to you mentioned competitive (48:51 - 48:56)
battling and whatnot and that's that's a (48:53 - 48:58)
huge time sink but is that where your (48:56 - 49:00)
time goes is the battling or are you (48:58 - 49:03)
more of a collector or you know breeder (49:00 - 49:06)
or how there's so many different avenues (49:03 - 49:08)
in pokemon that somebody can go down but (49:06 - 49:11)
we're what avenue to use seem to pick (49:08 - 49:14)
probably just competitive and breeding i (49:11 - 49:18)
think at least breeding to me is such a (49:14 - 49:20)
it's like a mindless task almost it's (49:18 - 49:22)
almost like playing like snake on your (49:20 - 49:24)
phone or something like that yeah so (49:22 - 49:26)
like I can really do other things while (49:24 - 49:28)
I'm doing it and I can always just be (49:26 - 49:30)
working towards something and feel like (49:28 - 49:32)
I'm accomplishing something especially (49:30 - 49:35)
we travel for shows on the weekends and (49:32 - 49:37)
we usually have about three shows every (49:35 - 49:41)
weekend and these these shows for us at (49:37 - 49:44)
least an NXT are usually around the (49:41 - 49:47)
florida orlando area so nothing is (49:44 - 49:50)
further than three hours but in those (49:47 - 49:52)
two or three-hour car rides i'm always (49:50 - 49:54)
if i'm not driving i'm always in the (49:52 - 49:57)
back setting up teams or just you know (49:54 - 49:59)
just messing around with stuff and doing (49:57 - 50:01)
things like that are there are there (49:59 - 50:03)
other guys in the car on the on the bus (50:01 - 50:06)
or however you travel playing pokemon I (50:03 - 50:09)
ours is it just is it just you not in my (50:06 - 50:13)
car specifically but lincei Dorado who's (50:09 - 50:17)
one of the cruiserweights on raw and 205 (50:13 - 50:21)
live is also a big competitive Pokemon (50:17 - 50:23)
player that's been ducking me since he (50:21 - 50:27)
found out that I was so so I guess I (50:23 - 50:29)
guess I'll take this opportunity to (50:27 - 50:32)
officially call him out and you put them (50:29 - 50:34)
on display for everybody to see because (50:32 - 50:36)
I haven't seen him since the game came (50:34 - 50:38)
out all right put them on the spot here (50:36 - 50:42)
yeah we do have a handful of guys Sawyer (50:38 - 50:46)
Fulton is a is a player to Amber moon (50:42 - 50:49)
plays so there's there's a good it's a (50:46 - 50:51)
good amount of people i don't i don't (50:49 - 50:53)
think anybody's as good as me but they (50:51 - 50:55)
do play they own the game I've been told (50:53 - 50:59)
that Sasha banks and Tyler breeze or big (50:55 - 51:02)
Pokemon fans too I didn't I actually (50:59 - 51:04)
haven't met either of them but I believe (51:02 - 51:06)
it they got moved up from NXT about a (51:04 - 51:08)
year ago they've been gone since I've (51:06 - 51:10)
been here so is there is their favorite (51:08 - 51:13)
pokemon or multiple pokemon that you (51:10 - 51:15)
that you love that you have passion for (51:13 - 51:18)
any standing out to you pokemon i love (51:15 - 51:21)
and it's always for like weird reasons i (51:18 - 51:26)
love Sableye I love dodrio podria what (51:21 - 51:27)
an interesting choice yeah I know it's a (51:26 - 51:29)
weird choice right the drills like (51:27 - 51:32)
dodrio i really like because i found out (51:29 - 51:34)
he was like he could be really good yeah (51:32 - 51:37)
yeah I always I'm always when I'm just (51:34 - 51:39)
trying to come up with guys that I want (51:37 - 51:41)
to use I'm like oh who's nobody really (51:39 - 51:43)
using is like odo dreams got pretty good (51:41 - 51:45)
stats and pretty good moves I could (51:43 - 51:48)
actually use him okay if I had to pick (51:45 - 51:53)
one I don't even know if I could um yeah (51:48 - 51:54)
I don't know but yeah I like those guys (51:53 - 51:57)
all right I'd have to look in my box and (51:54 - 51:59)
see what really jumped out at me but (51:57 - 52:02)
yeah I'm always under the the mindset (51:59 - 52:04)
that my favorite Pokemon changes like (52:02 - 52:08)
per day per absolutely yeah i'll be (52:04 - 52:10)
really feeling one guy one day and then (52:08 - 52:12)
the other day it's something else for (52:10 - 52:14)
select it's always arbitrary reasons to (52:12 - 52:18)
it's like I spoke at at c2e2 last year (52:14 - 52:20)
and I'm going to be speaking at c2e2 (52:18 - 52:22)
coming up the chicago comic and (52:20 - 52:25)
entertainment expo but one of my fondest (52:22 - 52:26)
memories was this little girl she must (52:25 - 52:28)
have been four or five years old in and (52:26 - 52:30)
she came up to me after the panel and (52:28 - 52:32)
she watched the whole thing and and she (52:30 - 52:34)
seemed really like shy and excited and (52:32 - 52:36)
her dad was with her and was like oh (52:34 - 52:38)
like my daughter has a question for you (52:36 - 52:41)
and I was like okay fully like it's like (52:38 - 52:43)
there's so many generic Pokemon (52:41 - 52:44)
questions that that I've been asked over (52:43 - 52:46)
the years like you know favorite pokemon (52:44 - 52:48)
right that's that's kind of the yeah the (52:46 - 52:51)
base first one basically yeah and and (52:48 - 52:54)
she was so cute and she it took her a (52:51 - 52:55)
while to say it but she eventually was (52:54 - 52:59)
like what what pokemon do you hate and I (52:55 - 53:00)
just thought that was so adorable and (52:59 - 53:03)
super funny of like they're 700 Pokemon (53:00 - 53:05)
and you want me like the question you (53:03 - 53:07)
want to ask me is what pokemon i hate (53:05 - 53:11)
when do I hate and I think I said baskul (53:07 - 53:12)
in but I want to pass that question to (53:11 - 53:14)
you is there of it is there a single (53:12 - 53:17)
pokemon that like you you just you just (53:14 - 53:19)
don't feel for I mean like the easy (53:17 - 53:22)
answer is like the whole you know of (53:19 - 53:25)
vanilluxe is an ice cream cone but it's (53:22 - 53:27)
not like we didn't have stupid pokemon (53:25 - 53:31)
like from the start ya like like Voltorb (53:27 - 53:33)
just being a ball yeah voltorb just a (53:31 - 53:36)
ball um you know I never really had a (53:33 - 53:39)
problem with those maybe I don't like um (53:36 - 53:41)
in its I think it's actually gonna (53:39 - 53:44)
change now but just because I saw Kangas (53:41 - 53:48)
guns in every team for the past four (53:44 - 53:52)
years now I don't think I think yeah I (53:48 - 53:54)
think I hate kangaskhan okay alright (53:52 - 53:57)
that's fair personally I would prefer a (53:54 - 53:59)
more kangaroo looking Pokemon than (53:57 - 54:01)
Kangas like a straight-up kangaroo yeah (53:59 - 54:03)
and and when I think of that i always (54:01 - 54:05)
think of the the zelda game i think it's (54:03 - 54:07)
like Oracle of Ages or something with (54:05 - 54:09)
the kangaroo with the boxing gloves I (54:07 - 54:11)
said why don't we have that Pokemon same (54:09 - 54:14)
with Roger from Tekken kangaroo with (54:11 - 54:16)
boxing gloves yeah I don't know why that (54:14 - 54:18)
just seems to work they can they can (54:16 - 54:20)
have boxing gloves and though what's the (54:18 - 54:23)
crap crap brawler as boxing gloves yeah (54:20 - 54:26)
yeah alright so change topic real quick (54:23 - 54:30)
what are your goals / plans for 2017 (54:26 - 54:33)
anything specific standing out there (54:30 - 54:36)
gold / plans for 2017 I guess you know (54:33 - 54:39)
I'm always just striving since I've (54:36 - 54:41)
started this whole wrestling journey (54:39 - 54:45)
right it's I've been so used to football (54:41 - 54:48)
that it's it's been it was easy to me at (54:45 - 54:51)
the end kind of almost you didn't take a (54:48 - 54:52)
whole lot of thought you didn't have to (54:51 - 54:54)
train a whole lot to get you know (54:52 - 54:58)
significantly better so i think this (54:54 - 55:01)
year i just want to keep on working and (54:58 - 55:03)
basically just keeping my head down and (55:01 - 55:06)
I want to math you know i'm not going to (55:03 - 55:07)
do it in a year but i'm gonna work (55:06 - 55:09)
towards mastering this new craft that (55:07 - 55:13)
i'm in awesome what uh we covered so (55:09 - 55:16)
much where can our listeners find you (55:13 - 55:18)
where where can they follow you where (55:16 - 55:20)
can they see you obviously they can see (55:18 - 55:22)
you down at NXT but on twitter facebook (55:20 - 55:25)
youtube where are you n the WWE Network (55:22 - 55:29)
someday for 999 a month that but (55:25 - 55:32)
otherwise the best way to keep up with (55:29 - 55:35)
me is on my Twitter at great black otaku (55:32 - 55:37)
if you search great black otaku you (55:35 - 55:39)
could probably find me on anything else (55:37 - 55:42)
I'm I've gotten the branding thing down (55:39 - 55:46)
pretty good yeah so I don't necessarily (55:42 - 55:48)
keep up with that yet scrape like a (55:46 - 55:49)
chuckle and Instagram great black of (55:48 - 55:51)
choco on facebook it's it's all over the (55:49 - 55:53)
place so if you search anywhere else (55:51 - 55:55)
it's probably that but Twitter is where (55:53 - 55:58)
I do most of especially with I you know (55:55 - 56:00)
get to talk to cool guys like you this (55:58 - 56:04)

stuff listen from Michelle from Rhode (58:42 - 58:48)
Island my assumption is the only (58:45 - 58:50)
Michelle in Rhode Island that would be (58:48 - 58:52)
my guest that's a very small state yeah (58:50 - 58:56)
probably coastline about Rhode Island is (58:52 - 59:00)
probably 30 cats big would be my my big (58:56 - 59:02)
weight is that we heard the ocean or (59:00 - 59:04)
excluding block island because block (59:02 - 59:06)
island is part of Rhode Island what do (59:04 - 59:07)
you think block island is like another (59:06 - 59:10)
10 cats no no it's got a cat and a half (59:07 - 59:14)
okay apparently people from Rhode Island (59:10 - 59:16)
really hate when you say that they live (59:14 - 59:18)
on Long Island rather than in Long (59:16 - 59:20)
Island what are you even talking about (59:18 - 59:22)
Rhode Island and Long Island are such (59:20 - 59:25)
different places where where are we (59:22 - 59:28)
right now rhode island Oh Rhode Island (59:25 - 59:34)
yeah yeah on Rhode Island roa (59:28 - 59:34)
rhode island in rhode island now with (59:34 - 59:40)
that attitude which is why they hate it (59:38 - 59:43)
when we say they live on road i'll yeah (59:40 - 59:47)
i would imagine so Michelle on Rhode (59:43 - 59:51)
Island retin-a hi Steve Travis and will (59:47 - 59:54)
thanks I'm really enjoying the show (59:51 - 59:56)
thank you for the time you put in to (59:54 - 59:58)
make it fun for everyone since finishing (59:56 - 60:01)
son and completing the Lola pokedex (59:58 - 60:04)
congratulations by the way I've decided (60:01 - 60:06)
that I want to get involved with the VG (60:04 - 60:09)
sees i'm not totally new to competitive (60:06 - 60:11)
battling but the last time i played (60:09 - 60:15)
online was jen for when i was actively (60:11 - 60:17)
on the sarah b forums we use smog on (60:15 - 60:20)
rules for single battles it was only and (60:17 - 60:22)
it was a great time but I fell off for (60:20 - 60:24)
it for a few years when I went away to (60:22 - 60:26)
college gen 7 has made competitive (60:24 - 60:28)
battling more accessible than ever so (60:26 - 60:30)
I'm totally ready to get back in again (60:28 - 60:32)
but I have some reservations there are a (60:30 - 60:34)
few things that are different about the (60:32 - 60:36)
VGC format than I'm used to the biggest (60:34 - 60:38)
change is the lack of tier system that (60:36 - 60:41)
smogon uses and the other big changes (60:38 - 60:43)
for me is double battles I'm confident I (60:41 - 60:45)
can learn double battles so i guess i am (60:43 - 60:47)
most uncomfortable with the whole free (60:45 - 60:51)
for all that the VGC seems to be with no (60:47 - 60:54)
ladders and a short ban list I'm looking (60:51 - 60:57)
at the top winning teams for national (60:54 - 60:58)
competitions in London and I was (60:57 - 61:01)
disappointed to see almost all to see (60:58 - 61:02)
that most of those teams were almost on (61:01 - 61:06)
all the same nearly all had a taboo one (61:02 - 61:07)
or two ultra beasts and either a (61:06 - 61:11)
Salamence or Garchomp got news for you (61:07 - 61:15)
it's been like that for several years (61:11 - 61:17)
I'll admit that I've been looking with (61:15 - 61:20)
looking at this with a basis bias when I (61:17 - 61:23)
when I battled online with smogon rules (61:20 - 61:25)
I focused on the extreme diversity of (61:23 - 61:29)
the UU and nu tears I have the most fun (61:25 - 61:31)
when I battle with my favorite Pokemon (61:29 - 61:34)
and a tier system that means there's a (61:31 - 61:37)
little time in place for all of them to (61:34 - 61:40)
have a fair shot in battle I think that (61:37 - 61:42)
makes things more fun because the sad (61:40 - 61:44)
reality is that some pokemon are better (61:42 - 61:47)
in battle some pokemon are better than (61:44 - 61:48)
others with (61:47 - 61:50)
math being the limitation there are (61:48 - 61:52)
hundreds of Pokemon the vast majority of (61:50 - 61:55)
them will never rarely be seen unless (61:52 - 61:57)
there's a place carved out for them (61:55 - 62:01)
these top VGC teams was a reminder of (61:57 - 62:03)
that if I want to make a balanced team (62:01 - 62:06)
of my favorite oh Lola Pokemon it likely (62:03 - 62:08)
won't stand a chance against a team of (62:06 - 62:10)
top ooze ultra beasts and powerful (62:08 - 62:13)
dragons even with a solid theoretical (62:10 - 62:15)
strategy it probably wouldn't be (62:13 - 62:17)
competitive I could just jump on the (62:15 - 62:18)
bandwagon to make a team like the rest (62:17 - 62:21)
but that wouldn't just be that just (62:18 - 62:22)
wouldn't be fun for me personally (62:21 - 62:25)
personally the taboos and ultra beasts (62:22 - 62:26)
are cool pokemon they're just not my (62:25 - 62:29)
style I'd like to know what will and (62:26 - 62:32)
Travis Travis's thoughts are do you ever (62:29 - 62:34)
struggle with choosing Pokemon you like (62:32 - 62:36)
first Pokemon you know will perform its (62:34 - 62:39)
role better should I just roll in with (62:36 - 62:41)
my wish cash and lose and with my head (62:39 - 62:44)
held high or I'm looking at this all (62:41 - 62:46)
wrong I know you're not you don't play (62:44 - 62:48)
competitive SBJ but that's okay because (62:46 - 62:49)
you are my favorite on the show ah (62:48 - 62:52)
thanks again for the great podcast and (62:49 - 62:55)
sorry for the long email I hope it makes (62:52 - 62:57)
for an interesting conversation Michelle (62:55 - 63:00)
well I can give a relatively simple (62:57 - 63:03)
response to that because it and i will (63:00 - 63:05)
say that when i started in competitive i (63:03 - 63:08)
was very much about the I want to use my (63:05 - 63:11)
favorite Pokemon I want to use wish cash (63:08 - 63:13)
named tickles that has Fisher and make (63:11 - 63:17)
people angry because when Fisher hits so (63:13 - 63:22)
Dom yeah that one hit knockout but I (63:17 - 63:24)
have changed a little bit and it's it's (63:22 - 63:26)
kind of like changing the framework of (63:24 - 63:31)
the way that you think about VGC so yes (63:26 - 63:35)
smug on tears are set so that they can (63:31 - 63:37)
sort of be more balanced right and that (63:35 - 63:39)
gives you more diversity in the pokemon (63:37 - 63:43)
that you can choose and that's what the (63:39 - 63:45)
smog on system is intended to be and (63:43 - 63:48)
what it achieves I would argue at this (63:45 - 63:53)
point in time that VGC has become more (63:48 - 63:57)
like chess wherein each person playing (63:53 - 64:00)
chess doesn't bring different (63:57 - 64:03)
pieces that have different abilities to (64:00 - 64:06)
the chess board each side has the same (64:03 - 64:09)
pieces and the same all the pieces do (64:06 - 64:11)
the same things it's then how they use (64:09 - 64:15)
those pieces strategically to win or (64:11 - 64:17)
lose and there's still a tremendous (64:15 - 64:19)
amount of strategy I mean obviously (64:17 - 64:21)
people are playing chess for hundreds (64:19 - 64:23)
and hundreds of years and it's about the (64:21 - 64:25)
strategy and the options that you that (64:23 - 64:28)
you take when you're playing chess that (64:25 - 64:31)
then becomes the game and it's not about (64:28 - 64:33)
the actual individual pieces you know (64:31 - 64:35)
nobody cares more for the Queen than (64:33 - 64:37)
they do for the bishop or the king it's (64:35 - 64:40)
just the Queen does a particular action (64:37 - 64:42)
the bishop does a particular action and (64:40 - 64:44)
the pawns do their particular actions (64:42 - 64:46)
it's how you put them into play and I (64:44 - 64:48)
think that's what VGC has become where (64:46 - 64:50)
everybody has a clear understanding of (64:48 - 64:52)
these are the top Pokemon that you can (64:50 - 64:56)
use it's how you use them the timing of (64:52 - 64:58)
your moves your ability to predict what (64:56 - 65:01)
your opponent is going to do the (64:58 - 65:02)
selection of moves that can be placed on (65:01 - 65:05)
those pokemon I mean obviously are there (65:02 - 65:07)
is a little bit of variety because there (65:05 - 65:09)
are a few different options that can be (65:07 - 65:11)
switched in and out but ultimately (65:09 - 65:14)
you're going to be selecting from those (65:11 - 65:16)
the top tier of Pokemon and then it (65:14 - 65:18)
becomes about the strategy and how you (65:16 - 65:21)
play how you select how you swap things (65:18 - 65:24)
in and out which to you pair up how you (65:21 - 65:26)
predict who your opponent is going to (65:24 - 65:28)
put out first so it's just it's a (65:26 - 65:30)
different kind of game so trying to (65:28 - 65:33)
think of them the same way it's you're (65:30 - 65:35)
not going to be able to be successful (65:33 - 65:36)
they don't really compare it's like (65:35 - 65:41)
comparing like risk to chess you know (65:36 - 65:43)
there are two different games both fun (65:41 - 65:45)
in their own way but still two (65:43 - 65:47)
completely different games so if you (65:45 - 65:51)
start thinking about VGC more like chess (65:47 - 65:52)
and about strategy and learning (65:51 - 65:55)
strategies and how to do prediction and (65:52 - 65:58)
all that kind of stuff you may grow to (65:55 - 66:00)
appreciate it more than you currently do (65:58 - 66:03)
and I think that's all I have on that (66:00 - 66:06)
hahaha like what you're gonna think just (66:03 - 66:10)
do your best and maintain integrity or (66:06 - 66:12)
if you can't do that then just cheese it (66:10 - 66:14)
then (66:12 - 66:17)
uh don't listen to the haters i would (66:14 - 66:20)
say that much less eloquent than with (66:17 - 66:25)
yeah i mean the whole seeing that (66:20 - 66:27)
everyone uses the same teams has been a (66:25 - 66:31)
pretty big issue / I I think personally (66:27 - 66:33)
in the last couple years of the video (66:31 - 66:36)
game and I would actually say from what (66:33 - 66:38)
I've seen what I've heard this format is (66:36 - 66:43)
the most diverse it has been which isn't (66:38 - 66:45)
saying much as you are still seeing very (66:43 - 66:48)
similar teams to pick you back off what (66:45 - 66:52)
will said I will there's nothing wrong (66:48 - 66:55)
with picking the Pokemon you like and (66:52 - 66:57)
what you want to use I think it's more (66:55 - 67:02)
important to understand why those six (66:57 - 67:04)
Pokemon being used are being used why is (67:02 - 67:08)
taboo lele or top boo boo loo why are (67:04 - 67:10)
they being used and how are they being (67:08 - 67:12)
used and what can you do to counter that (67:10 - 67:15)
and i think that's that's just as (67:12 - 67:17)
important to I think that's more (67:15 - 67:19)
important than your own team is just (67:17 - 67:22)
understanding how these high-level teams (67:19 - 67:25)
are functioning through that my advice (67:22 - 67:27)
would be (67:25 - 67:31)
pick whatever top of Layla Bert a boo (67:27 - 67:33)
boo loo or whatever one you want that (67:31 - 67:35)
people are using pick a you be that (67:33 - 67:37)
other people are using pick a couple (67:35 - 67:40)
pick a Salamence or a goodra and then (67:37 - 67:43)
kind of experiment off of that and see (67:40 - 67:44)
if you can get any synergy because then (67:43 - 67:48)
you have the advantage of okay I'm you (67:44 - 67:52)
I'm using the same chess pieces that (67:48 - 67:55)
they are going off wills analogy but now (67:52 - 67:57)
i'm also bringing in a couple of my (67:55 - 67:59)
other personal pieces that number wise (67:57 - 68:02)
might not be as good but their pokemon i (67:59 - 68:05)
enjoy using and you at least have one (68:02 - 68:08)
advantage with with pokemon that aren't (68:05 - 68:11)
commonly seen and that advantage is (68:08 - 68:15)
people don't know what to do against (68:11 - 68:18)
that I think that's why pachirisu did so (68:15 - 68:22)
well in the 2015 video game (68:18 - 68:24)
championships maybe 2014 I'm sorry if I (68:22 - 68:25)
got that wrong but I think it was 15 (68:24 - 68:27)
because I was there the the the (68:25 - 68:30)
advantage that hot cherry sue had and (68:27 - 68:33)
why it made it why it won is because (68:30 - 68:37)
when people saw pachirisu they didn't (68:33 - 68:39)
know what to do with it they didn't know (68:37 - 68:40)
if they should have it they should (68:39 - 68:42)
attack it first if they should ignore it (68:40 - 68:45)
uh they didn't know what moves it had (68:42 - 68:46)
they didn't know they couldn't remember (68:45 - 68:49)
its ability and that's why it did so (68:46 - 68:52)
well is no one knew what to do with it I (68:49 - 68:55)
had success with that with myrrh actus (68:52 - 68:57)
when I played the video game back when (68:55 - 68:59)
black and white people saumur actus they (68:57 - 69:00)
didn't know whether to attack it first (68:59 - 69:04)
whether to ignore it whether to focus on (69:00 - 69:06)
it they didn't know if it could survive (69:04 - 69:09)
a certain hit they couldn't remember (69:06 - 69:12)
what interact his ability was and my (69:09 - 69:14)
advantage was if they ignored it that (69:12 - 69:15)
would have been the best for me because (69:14 - 69:20)
it was a defensive set up Pokemon so I (69:15 - 69:22)
the fact that they did ignore it did put (69:20 - 69:25)
me edited at an advantage that's just (69:22 - 69:26)
something to think about i'm not saying (69:25 - 69:28)
that's like the best route to go but i (69:26 - 69:31)
don't i mean i like that that's (69:28 - 69:33)
happening or that has happened because i (69:31 - 69:37)
think especially in an Internet age with (69:33 - 69:41)
competitive anything it's really hard to (69:37 - 69:43)
do something that offends the meta (69:41 - 69:46)
because everybody has access to the the (69:43 - 69:49)
same information and what works the best (69:46 - 69:54)
and how to how to make that work and I (69:49 - 69:57)
think situations like that where people (69:54 - 70:00)
are just throwing things into the mix (69:57 - 70:01)
that people don't know how to react to (70:00 - 70:03)
because it's not a part of the meta (70:01 - 70:06)
that's I don't know it's that's (70:03 - 70:08)
hilarious to me and also an amazing (70:06 - 70:11)
strategy in a double battle you're only (70:08 - 70:13)
using four of the six so I think that (70:11 - 70:17)
you should pick a team and try to stick (70:13 - 70:18)
with that team and then make minor (70:17 - 70:21)
adjustments as you go but I don't think (70:18 - 70:23)
there's anything wrong with using the (70:21 - 70:24)
Pokemon that other people are using (70:23 - 70:26)
while while it's not video game related (70:24 - 70:30)
in the in the TCG there was always these (70:26 - 70:33)
are the top 4 most popular decks they're (70:30 - 70:36)
pretty much virtually the same I think (70:33 - 70:39)
any TCG that's always how it's been yeah (70:36 - 70:41)
once people had easy access to the (70:39 - 70:44)
internet again it's yep and the thing (70:41 - 70:46)
about TCG which will apply to the video (70:44 - 70:49)
game is you can look at the card list (70:46 - 70:50)
you can look at the Pokemon list the (70:49 - 70:53)
Pokemon moves and there's a difference (70:50 - 70:54)
between somebody just handing you a deck (70:53 - 70:56)
and saying okay this is the best deck in (70:54 - 70:58)
the format and there's a difference of (70:56 - 71:00)
understanding actually how that deck (70:58 - 71:04)
works right with Darkrai Sableye which (71:00 - 71:06)
was one of the more popular decks in the (71:04 - 71:09)
format when I was playing it was very (71:06 - 71:11)
important when to play you're crushing (71:09 - 71:14)
hammers and you're in enhanced hammers I (71:11 - 71:17)
can't remember crushing hammers was the (71:14 - 71:19)
the important card like crushing hammer (71:17 - 71:20)
what it did is you roll a dice if you (71:19 - 71:23)
roll if you roll a dice if it's evens or (71:20 - 71:25)
flip a coin if it's heads you get to (71:23 - 71:28)
discard an energy from a Pokemon from (71:25 - 71:30)
your opponent's pokemon which is a very (71:28 - 71:32)
powerful card and the reason you would (71:30 - 71:35)
do that darkrai Sableye is to prevent (71:32 - 71:37)
them from attacking now what when you (71:35 - 71:40)
get the deck and you get the cards they (71:37 - 71:42)
don't tell you when to use crushing (71:40 - 71:43)
hammer and that's the difference between (71:42 - 71:46)
an average player and a really (71:43 - 71:48)
exceptional player is because the (71:46 - 71:49)
exceptional player will use crushing (71:48 - 71:52)
hammer on Pokemon add (71:49 - 71:55)
cific time or a Pokemon that's a threat (71:52 - 71:57)
that's all I'm saying is I think your (71:55 - 72:00)
first thing as somebody who's new to the (71:57 - 72:02)
VG sees not playing since diamond and (72:00 - 72:06)
pearl is understand why those four moves (72:02 - 72:08)
are there understand why that ability is (72:06 - 72:10)
there understand what when you see those (72:08 - 72:13)
two Pokemon together because most of the (72:10 - 72:17)
time in a doubles battle pokemon come (72:13 - 72:20)
out in pairs like you all like in the (72:17 - 72:21)
black and white days they always start (72:20 - 72:24)
with a torn Addis and like track yeah so (72:21 - 72:27)
understanding what to what to pokemon or (72:24 - 72:29)
opening or what to pokemon are closing (72:27 - 72:32)
or the pairings is what i'm getting at (72:29 - 72:36)
competitive to it it's something but now (72:32 - 72:39)
when I did competitive TCG my favorite (72:36 - 72:43)
thing was was building unique decks and (72:39 - 72:45)
I think the satisfaction I got wasn't (72:43 - 72:48)
necessarily winning it was somebody (72:45 - 72:50)
commenting on the creativity of my deck (72:48 - 72:53)
yeah having fun with that but you know (72:50 - 72:57)
just to carry on the TCG part right you (72:53 - 72:59)
have those top decks but think about a (72:57 - 73:01)
player like Jason closed in ski it's (72:59 - 73:03)
with him it's it's not about the cards (73:01 - 73:06)
in the deck it's the fact that he knows (73:03 - 73:09)
like every other build that he's going (73:06 - 73:12)
to see in a competition and he's able to (73:09 - 73:15)
memorize every card he see that sees it (73:12 - 73:18)
comes out like in play he knows how many (73:15 - 73:20)
of what card you have and if you've used (73:18 - 73:22)
them up or not he probably knows more (73:20 - 73:25)
about your deck what anything against it (73:22 - 73:28)
you do right says a lot about the skill (73:25 - 73:30)
it's not about the cards that are in the (73:28 - 73:32)
deck there's a lot of that in magic the (73:30 - 73:34)
gathering to a lot of like card counting (73:32 - 73:38)
and I mean people just SAT around and in (73:34 - 73:41)
downtime would just constantly play like (73:38 - 73:45)
the top eight net decks and look at all (73:41 - 73:47)
the combinations and how to react with (73:45 - 73:49)
whatever it was that you were using and (73:47 - 73:52)
it's I mean that's part of strategy and (73:49 - 73:56)
it's also part of living in an age where (73:52 - 73:58)
everybody has access to pretty much the (73:56 - 74:00)
same information you just gotta get that (73:58 - 74:04)
competitive strategic edge over I guess (74:00 - 74:06)
everybody else because they all (74:04 - 74:07)
have the same info that you have or you (74:06 - 74:09)
have to assume that they have the same (74:07 - 74:11)
info that you have competitive is is (74:09 - 74:14)
weird it's a it's something but yeah (74:11 - 74:17)
have fun with it I mean that that's (74:14 - 74:19)
that's hopefully why you're doing it (74:17 - 74:21)
right like I didn't I stopped playing (74:19 - 74:24)
the TCG when I stopped having fun and (74:21 - 74:28)
really the the thing that stops being (74:24 - 74:29)
fun was the travel and the time (74:28 - 74:32)
commitment and how poorly the events (74:29 - 74:35)
were organized like that's really what (74:32 - 74:37)
did it for me not so much the game (74:35 - 74:39)
itself there were changes in the game (74:37 - 74:41)
that I didn't really care for but it was (74:39 - 74:43)
really everything else around that and (74:41 - 74:47)
it just wasn't worth my time anymore to (74:43 - 74:50)
the the ratio of fun I was actually (74:47 - 74:52)
having so that's that's where I come (74:50 - 74:54)
from that so as long as you're going in (74:52 - 74:56)
with the VGC like I said uh don't be (74:54 - 74:57)
afraid to pick some of those you know (74:56 - 75:00)
Pokemon you might not like just to help (74:57 - 75:03)
form a base or a starting point and yeah (75:00 - 75:05)
don't be afraid to use Pokemon that you (75:03 - 75:07)
do like Pachirisu did extremely well and (75:05 - 75:11)
that Pokemon is not good number wise it (75:07 - 75:13)
was just how it was used around the (75:11 - 75:15)
other combinations that existed Martin (75:13 - 75:18)
rights in says dear poked my podcast (75:15 - 75:21)
folks you know what really grinds my (75:18 - 75:23)
gears everything from fan art to (75:21 - 75:27)
official merchandise the it's like an (75:23 - 75:30)
emoji the like like straight face the (75:27 - 75:31)
like smiley face that's not a smile is (75:30 - 75:34)
just like a line as all straight lines (75:31 - 75:36)
yeah that represents the disguised ditto (75:34 - 75:40)
and it winds me up every time I don't (75:36 - 75:42)
know why that one episode in series one (75:40 - 75:45)
where the where did Oh couldn't do faces (75:42 - 75:47)
until the end of the episode when it (75:45 - 75:50)
figures out and no other ditto has ever (75:47 - 75:53)
had this problem in 20 years now I know (75:50 - 75:55)
that it's a cool nod to the occasional (75:53 - 75:57)
plush of ditto and it's been difficult (75:55 - 76:00)
to give that nudge to give a nudge to (75:57 - 76:02)
show that it's a ditto otherwise I get (76:00 - 76:05)
it but grrrrrr rant over has this ever (76:02 - 76:07)
bothered you guys are just me keep up (76:05 - 76:09)
the good work no matter how far I am (76:07 - 76:12)
behind an other podcast this one always (76:09 - 76:14)
jumps straight to my top priorities (76:12 - 76:17)
Martin from England doesn't matter where (76:14 - 76:19)
in England it's smaller than all of your (76:17 - 76:20)
state's (76:19 - 76:22)
well not smaller than road I now run i (76:20 - 76:25)
would say that England is probably like (76:22 - 76:29)
60 cats and rhode island is closer to 30 (76:25 - 76:32)
oh no England's like 120 cats you are (76:29 - 76:34)
forget wait are you just saying England (76:32 - 76:37)
are you including like Scotland Wales (76:34 - 76:40)
and Northern Ireland I would probably (76:37 - 76:42)
say just like England England oh okay so (76:40 - 76:45)
yeah okay England's probably about 60 (76:42 - 76:47)
cats and then you have to the rest of (76:45 - 76:49)
the United Kingdom would increase the (76:47 - 76:51)
number of cats by about 30 yeah (76:49 - 76:53)
geography it's a good geography (76:51 - 76:56)
discussion as for the ditto face I get (76:53 - 76:59)
what he's talking about I don't know I i (76:56 - 77:02)
I'm I think it's cute I think it's cute (76:59 - 77:05)
and I makes me want to buy more plushies (77:02 - 77:06)
which I can't believe I use the word (77:05 - 77:09)
plush I never used that word but I want (77:06 - 77:10)
to buy them all I want to get those cute (77:09 - 77:13)
little databases I'm on the same page (77:10 - 77:15)
yeah I think it's fine marketing-wise (77:13 - 77:18)
you want you want a face to be instantly (77:15 - 77:21)
distinct like instantly like oh I know (77:18 - 77:24)
that's a ditto I think it's also (77:21 - 77:26)
hilarious to see you Pokemon and then (77:24 - 77:28)
that face is on it you don't expect it (77:26 - 77:31)
also it's such a simple face right it's (77:28 - 77:34)
not it's not like it has a specific i (77:31 - 77:37)
type or specific mouth it's it's two (77:34 - 77:39)
diagonals I got to the line it's so (77:37 - 77:43)
simple so since that faces iconic like (77:39 - 77:45)
that it's very easy to pop on a (77:43 - 77:47)
bulbasaur to plop on a chikorita to plop (77:45 - 77:51)
on a you know Torchic actually I don't (77:47 - 77:53)
know how would work in a torchic I guess (77:51 - 77:56)
it just wouldn't have a beak II it's a (77:53 - 77:58)
good question it's good that that that (77:56 - 77:59)
is the question that needs to be (77:58 - 78:03)
answered ed marketing-wise I think (77:59 - 78:05)
that's why why it exists but I don't (78:03 - 78:06)
know I guess I don't have a problem with (78:05 - 78:08)
it I'm trying to think of what does (78:06 - 78:10)
grind my gears and nothing is standing (78:08 - 78:12)
out right now but i'll probably i can (78:10 - 78:13)
complain about something just give me (78:12 - 78:17)
give me some time well ok so if we want (78:13 - 78:19)
to complain about pokemon stuffed (78:17 - 78:22)
animals I what I would wish that they (78:19 - 78:25)
would stop doing is making stuffed (78:22 - 78:30)
animals of the larger more complex (78:25 - 78:35)
pokemon like honestly there is no way to (78:30 - 78:37)
make a good stuff to Kyurem so just (78:35 - 78:39)
don't do it right don't I don't think a (78:37 - 78:42)
stuffed Zekrom it's just gonna look dumb (78:39 - 78:45)
it always looks like garbage I don't I (78:42 - 78:47)
don't need nobody really needs a stuff (78:45 - 78:50)
fresh rim and it doesn't look good I (78:47 - 78:52)
stuff is earnest which kind of like just (78:50 - 78:55)
falls over because the legs aren't (78:52 - 78:58)
sitting now only an agentless EV Pokemon (78:55 - 79:01)
not having actually held it just looking (78:58 - 79:03)
at it on the site it's not enticing to (79:01 - 79:06)
buy I got speaking of plushies I got the (79:03 - 79:10)
mimic you plush I'm very jealous it's I (79:06 - 79:11)
mean you are over I didn't show to you (79:10 - 79:15)
it's uh it's really nice it stands which (79:11 - 79:17)
a lot of plushies have an issue with (79:15 - 79:20)
like standing straight up and it's not (79:17 - 79:22)
fur I don't know what to call it like (79:20 - 79:25)
the plush eNOS of it is real soft it's (79:22 - 79:29)
it's soft like the goomy blanket and I'd (79:25 - 79:31)
say that that was extra soft extra soft (79:29 - 79:34)
and so like I like the pokey doll (79:31 - 79:36)
plushies a lot I like the plushies that (79:34 - 79:38)
look like they're plushes and not the (79:36 - 79:40)
realistic plushies like you guys we're (79:38 - 79:41)
talking about like the kiram plush they (79:40 - 79:43)
try to make that look realistic and it (79:41 - 79:46)
looks like garbage but I like the the (79:43 - 79:48)
pokey pushes a lot I don't know they (79:46 - 79:50)
feel like a normal stuffed animal but (79:48 - 79:53)
the mimic you just feels like the (79:50 - 79:56)
material they used for the goomy blanket (79:53 - 79:58)
and I don't know probably some kind of (79:56 - 80:01)
cotton / polyester but I'm like looking (79:58 - 80:02)
at my for plushies above my head right (80:01 - 80:06)
now on a shelf I have a jirachi uh from (80:02 - 80:09)
poky center Mudkip from toys r us so I (80:06 - 80:12)
think it's like a Tommy one the beanbag (80:09 - 80:15)
Pikachu from poky center and the pikachu (80:12 - 80:17)
pokey doll from pokemon center and none (80:15 - 80:20)
of them feel as soft they all feels (80:17 - 80:22)
those all four of those feel similar I (80:20 - 80:24)
guess the Mudkip feels a little cheaper (80:22 - 80:26)
but the mimic you is on a different (80:24 - 80:29)
level of softness a spooky level of (80:26 - 80:33)
softness spooky softness I'm getting (80:29 - 80:34)
very jealous listen to me talk about (80:33 - 80:37)
this spooks I got it it's also pretty (80:34 - 80:40)
big I compared to other plushies I got (80:37 - 80:41)
for n it (80:40 - 80:43)
I think with so many cats heads probably (80:41 - 80:46)
about a half cat big that's pretty big (80:43 - 80:49)
yeah and it's decent size Micah when you (80:46 - 80:51)
go over to Steve's house and see if you (80:49 - 80:53)
can feel free to take your headphones (80:51 - 80:55)
off reb innate you don't go through his (80:53 - 80:57)
stuff (80:55 - 81:00)
um should I like it is all we have to (80:57 - 81:03)
start doing now always do one hundred (81:00 - 81:05)
percent of the time I always go through (81:03 - 81:08)
stuff huh that too goes to bed I'm like (81:05 - 81:13)
in everything alright well no now I know (81:08 - 81:15)
what I need to step up to you yeah you (81:13 - 81:18)
up you find some real nice stuff here i (81:15 - 81:21)
guess uh you would have had a minute you (81:18 - 81:23)
because it looks like mimic you is no (81:21 - 81:26)
longer on the Pokemon centers oh snap (81:23 - 81:29)
and I'm gonna lose my mind if that is (81:26 - 81:32)
the case breaking news haha do they sell (81:29 - 81:35)
out I don't it's not even listed did you (81:32 - 81:38)
go to a lowland polkadot Pokemon there's (81:35 - 81:40)
like unless there's a section for a (81:38 - 81:43)
lonely lonely merch oh maybe that's what (81:40 - 81:45)
it is it's under collections I think (81:43 - 81:47)
okay as you look that up I'll read (81:45 - 81:50)
Christine's email all right Christine (81:47 - 81:54)
from Concord California just found your (81:50 - 81:56)
show and I love it I've been doing a lot (81:54 - 81:59)
of Pokemon breeding and sun and moon and (81:56 - 82:01)
i found your podcasts to listen to while (81:59 - 82:03)
I do the breeding stuff I don't know why (82:01 - 82:06)
I a done braiding stuff I just felt like (82:03 - 82:07)
that was a better way to end the (82:06 - 82:09)
sentence I know history discussion on (82:07 - 82:12)
sylveon and offer the position that it (82:09 - 82:16)
was not designed to look girly forgive (82:12 - 82:18)
me for not citing in name but I just (82:16 - 82:22)
started listening and I can't dis Curran (82:18 - 82:25)
whose voices who's yet I have to (82:22 - 82:27)
disagree with you yes it's pink but (82:25 - 82:29)
beyond that the route there are ribbons (82:27 - 82:32)
as you acknowledge impose I think the (82:29 - 82:35)
point is well-taken that this does not (82:32 - 82:39)
identify it as a female but it is what (82:35 - 82:43)
we in the LGBTQ community would consider (82:39 - 82:49)
hi femme is that femm e da ya took it um (82:43 - 82:54)
also I say LGBTQ really slow cuz you (82:49 - 82:56)
gotta make sure you hit home yeah (82:54 - 82:58)
otherwise I just wanna learn them all (82:56 - 83:01)
together or I forget a letter it's cuz (82:58 - 83:03)
you're Steve so yeah I've asked in (83:01 - 83:06)
enough trouble talking as it is well let (83:03 - 83:07)
me finish this and then we will go back (83:06 - 83:09)
to this it bears cultural signifiers (83:07 - 83:11)
marked (83:09 - 83:13)
associated with one's gender and I think (83:11 - 83:15)
that's awesome Pokemon sensex's were (83:13 - 83:18)
introduced have had kind of a subversive (83:15 - 83:22)
gender sensibility to it to me that's a (83:18 - 83:24)
huge part of the appeal I love that my (83:22 - 83:27)
mail pre marina with sparkling lashed (83:24 - 83:30)
eyes and feminine mannerisms can face (83:27 - 83:33)
off against a stone cold butch female (83:30 - 83:36)
mud choke whereas in children's popular (83:33 - 83:38)
media you can find such a broad range of (83:36 - 83:40)
gender expressions regardless of sex (83:38 - 83:42)
personally I think it's great and I'm (83:40 - 83:45)
sure that there are some children out (83:42 - 83:48)
there that love it too anywho I'm not (83:45 - 83:50)
sure where you were coming from with (83:48 - 83:51)
your response just thought I'd added my (83:50 - 83:54)
two cents thanks pristine so I think I (83:51 - 83:57)
was the one who said something about how (83:54 - 84:00)
sylveon doesn't have to be necessarily (83:57 - 84:03)
feminine because it's pink and bows and (84:00 - 84:06)
everything and I would just argue also (84:03 - 84:12)
as a member of the LGBTQ community right (84:06 - 84:15)
you got every letter as a homosexual (84:12 - 84:20)
dude i would say that even as (84:15 - 84:23)
homosexuals we don't necessarily look (84:20 - 84:25)
into gender concepts in the same way as (84:23 - 84:28)
people who are more directly impacted by (84:25 - 84:32)
concepts of gender and in actuality (84:28 - 84:35)
concepts of feminine versus masculine (84:32 - 84:37)
are actually becoming more and more (84:35 - 84:40)
outdated um that just because culturally (84:37 - 84:43)
something was assigned to be masculine (84:40 - 84:47)
or feminine doesn't make it so right (84:43 - 84:49)
it's not eternally so etched in the (84:47 - 84:52)
fabric of the universe that pink bows (84:49 - 84:56)
are feminine and I don't know hard hats (84:52 - 84:59)
and shovels very masculine right that we (84:56 - 85:01)
need to break free from these concepts (84:59 - 85:03)
in order to better ourselves and better (85:01 - 85:07)
understanding of all humans who may feel (85:03 - 85:09)
like a little of both is perfectly fine (85:07 - 85:12)
for the way that they identify for their (85:09 - 85:14)
own gender expression and it's also very (85:12 - 85:17)
dangerous to identify things as say (85:14 - 85:20)
femme and Butch because we also have a (85:17 - 85:24)
tendency to assign bad too (85:20 - 85:27)
things that are feminine when neither (85:24 - 85:30)
concept that it's not good or bad or (85:27 - 85:32)
it's actually particularly feminine (85:30 - 85:34)
which would be associated to women it (85:32 - 85:36)
matters right it's it's just the way (85:34 - 85:38)
that something looks and I think one of (85:36 - 85:40)
the things I said which might have kind (85:38 - 85:43)
of gotten cut down a little bit was the (85:40 - 85:45)
fact that pink was originally a boy's (85:43 - 85:48)
color right and it was it was because (85:45 - 85:50)
pink was actually associated with blood (85:48 - 85:53)
and therefore it was considered to be (85:50 - 85:56)
more of a masculine color and then over (85:53 - 85:58)
time it became associated with little (85:56 - 86:00)
girls and became more feminine so (85:58 - 86:04)
ultimately these concepts are purely (86:00 - 86:07)
human creation they're not tied to (86:04 - 86:09)
anything eternal in the universe and it (86:07 - 86:13)
doesn't make any sense to keep ourselves (86:09 - 86:17)
tied down to outdated concepts when we (86:13 - 86:19)
can just say you know something is (86:17 - 86:23)
something and there's actually nothing (86:19 - 86:26)
humorous about a boy wearing pink bows (86:23 - 86:30)
because it's just a person wearing pink (86:26 - 86:32)
bows because they enjoy it and that's (86:30 - 86:34)
all that matters (86:32 - 86:37)
yeah well said I very well said I've (86:34 - 86:40)
also said this before but I like when I (86:37 - 86:42)
catch certain pokemon I want them to be (86:40 - 86:43)
a certain gender and I don't think that (86:42 - 86:47)
that's because it comes from Orion's are (86:43 - 86:49)
only male because they look mail I don't (86:47 - 86:50)
think it comes from that I think it (86:49 - 86:53)
comes from the same concept of like (86:50 - 86:56)
picking a pet all three cats in my house (86:53 - 86:59)
or mail and if I was to ever get another (86:56 - 87:01)
cat it would always it would continue to (86:59 - 87:04)
be a male cat I just always want boy (87:01 - 87:06)
cats and I think that just comes from me (87:04 - 87:08)
coming home and being like where my boys (87:06 - 87:09)
and then all three come running up oh (87:08 - 87:12)
good lord it's because you're a sexist (87:09 - 87:16)
pig yeah exactly I kid got me and so I (87:12 - 87:18)
think that's okay for people to go like (87:16 - 87:21)
I want a fennekin but I wanted male I (87:18 - 87:23)
don't think that that means like (87:21 - 87:26)
fennekin must be male just people have a (87:23 - 87:29)
preference like my dad he's he he's (87:26 - 87:31)
always had dogs but all his dogs have (87:29 - 87:33)
always been female like he's never (87:31 - 87:36)
wanted the male dog I don't know if (87:33 - 87:37)
there's a name for that or anything or (87:36 - 87:39)
if that's just like a want aura or a (87:37 - 87:41)
personal preference but that's just how (87:39 - 87:44)
I Fiona nism is the exactly that's the (87:41 - 87:49)
name right there I mean that was kind of (87:44 - 87:52)
a joke but that really shook I would (87:49 - 87:55)
argue that in this in in the context of (87:52 - 88:01)
a video game that relies on breeding and (87:55 - 88:04)
requiring specific genders for breeding (88:01 - 88:06)
it's a little bit different than like I (88:04 - 88:10)
don't know a perception like a global (88:06 - 88:13)
perception issue I think it's less I (88:10 - 88:16)
don't know I mean I i I've never really (88:13 - 88:18)
considered Pokemon to be like a shining (88:16 - 88:21)
example of inclusivity as far as gender (88:18 - 88:24)
cuts because it's just here you go this (88:21 - 88:27)
is the suppo c'mon it's this one's male (88:24 - 88:29)
this is female make them made there were (88:27 - 88:32)
good [ __ ] yeah slow slow steps little (88:29 - 88:36)
steps right so I mean I think I think (88:32 - 88:39)
from what you're saying as far as how (88:36 - 88:43)
you play pokemon or what you look for in (88:39 - 88:44)
pokemon or what you require out of it (88:43 - 88:47)
it's that's more from a gaming (88:44 - 88:48)
standpoint (88:47 - 88:52)
than it is from a like an actual gender (88:48 - 88:54)
perception yeah yeah I wasn't saying (88:52 - 88:56)
when I was just bringing up the case (88:54 - 88:58)
that it's because that's like that (88:56 - 89:00)
before and I didn't explain it like that (88:58 - 89:01)
so I didn't want anyone to be confused (89:00 - 89:03)
of like why do you only want male (89:01 - 89:05)
Pikachu well it's the same reason I only (89:03 - 89:08)
want male cats I don't know like when (89:05 - 89:10)
you picked your cat out if you did when (89:08 - 89:13)
you went to get your cat where you like (89:10 - 89:15)
did you talk with your wife of like I (89:13 - 89:16)
want a male cat or I want a female cuz (89:15 - 89:18)
she didn't know oh it was a it was a (89:16 - 89:21)
Christmas gift but you still had to pay (89:18 - 89:24)
got male or female or yes well orange or (89:21 - 89:28)
brown or black or so my friend Carlos (89:24 - 89:30)
and I we went to the humane society and (89:28 - 89:33)
we looked at the cats and I said this (89:30 - 89:35)
one is the prettiest because he (89:33 - 89:40)
absolutely was and the nameplate said (89:35 - 89:43)
Dean Martin was his like Humane Society (89:40 - 89:46)
given name and Carlos and I looked at (89:43 - 89:47)
each other and said that's the cat (89:46 - 89:51)
that's it that's it and so that that was (89:47 - 89:55)
it and then and now his is a huge jerk I (89:51 - 89:59)
love him but he's a huge jerk there was (89:55 - 90:02)
no real like I don't know I I don't (89:59 - 90:05)
really have any Brett like preference (90:02 - 90:07)
when I'm (90:05 - 90:09)
pick an animal that's I think that there (90:07 - 90:12)
are some for some people there are (90:09 - 90:15)
things that they look for specifically (90:12 - 90:16)
for I don't really I don't really know (90:15 - 90:17)
enough about it because I don't really (90:16 - 90:20)
look at I don't consider this when i'm (90:17 - 90:25)
looking at pets but like how certain (90:20 - 90:29)
like male or female cats or dogs will (90:25 - 90:33)
interact with environments or depending (90:29 - 90:35)
on your home situation what that could (90:33 - 90:38)
potentially mean for I don't know I (90:35 - 90:41)
don't know enough about it I it was not (90:38 - 90:43)
a factor though when I when I was (90:41 - 90:46)
looking at my pets my cat were my dog (90:43 - 90:48)
well I mean going back to Christine's (90:46 - 90:52)
email I don't know who said it looked (90:48 - 90:54)
girly unless I brought up that other (90:52 - 90:56)
people thought it looked girly because (90:54 - 90:59)
it was the letter writer oh okay the (90:56 - 91:01)
whole the whole point of the letter was (90:59 - 91:04)
that the letter writer thought it was (91:01 - 91:06)
funny that they had a male Sylvia okay (91:04 - 91:09)
as it was yeah I mean looking pretty pre (91:06 - 91:11)
marina I know like there was there were (91:09 - 91:13)
voices out there that pre marina looks (91:11 - 91:16)
extremely feminine and that that's fine (91:13 - 91:19)
like I would say that my logic and board (91:16 - 91:22)
looks extremely mail and that's fine I I (91:19 - 91:24)
guess that stuff has never bothered me (91:22 - 91:27)
yeah it sort of bothered me there so the (91:24 - 91:29)
only thing I would say is as kind of my (91:27 - 91:31)
last word on this is ninety-nine percent (91:29 - 91:34)
of the time when you apply a label to (91:31 - 91:38)
something that's usually a bad idea (91:34 - 91:40)
with masculine and feminine being labels (91:38 - 91:44)
I would agree with that yeah there's no (91:40 - 91:46)
argument there but now people people (91:44 - 91:48)
like pokemon for certain reasons and (91:46 - 91:51)
sylveon is really cool though (91:48 - 91:54)
no one's disagreeing there I love (91:51 - 91:57)
sylviane love Sylvia myself if I could (91:54 - 92:01)
rename my cat out maybe rename it this (91:57 - 92:04)

it's around the corner from my house (95:24 - 95:28)
thank God I guys can see membership to (95:26 - 95:31)
the light into the White House gym yeah (95:28 - 95:32)
and I also live around the corner from (95:31 - 95:37)
the White House hahaha oh the big city (95:32 - 95:39)
boys things are expensive I don't think (95:37 - 95:43)
it I don't think DC is that big that's (95:39 - 95:45)
bigger than when you live well I don't (95:43 - 95:48)
think it's bigger than milwaukee now (95:45 - 95:50)
definitely not in the physical size (95:48 - 95:53)
either hi pretty sure Milwaukee's like (95:50 - 95:56)
twenty eighth biggest city in the United (95:53 - 95:58)
States it's just a very expensive place (95:56 - 96:00)
to live can we leave it at that yeah I (95:58 - 96:02)
agree with that when I visited it was (96:00 - 96:04)
very expensive alright let's hear as you (96:02 - 96:05)
didn't you didn't call me but what I (96:04 - 96:08)
didn't know you at that point alright (96:05 - 96:11)
let's hear these mutters all right let's (96:08 - 96:13)
break it down let's make it easy for you (96:11 - 96:16)
um there are really (96:13 - 96:18)
three things that you should look at if (96:16 - 96:20)
you are going into a fitness nutrition (96:18 - 96:23)
store of whatever a variety two proteins (96:20 - 96:25)
and then one other option and then (96:23 - 96:27)
anything else you can pretty much (96:25 - 96:29)
consider to be bunk unless you really (96:27 - 96:32)
have it on a reliable source from (96:29 - 96:34)
somebody you've seen who's like ripped (96:32 - 96:38)
big gains huge muscle dude right number (96:34 - 96:41)
one you want to get that whey protein my (96:38 - 96:44)
preference is to get whey protein (96:41 - 96:46)
isolate so definitely look for that on (96:44 - 96:49)
the label just not just regular whey (96:46 - 96:52)
protein you want whey protein isolate it (96:49 - 96:54)
tends to digest a little easier so if (96:52 - 96:59)
you have any kind of milk problem you (96:54 - 97:00)
might have less of it if you're only (96:59 - 97:04)
doing the isolate you take a whey (97:00 - 97:06)
protein before and after working out (97:04 - 97:10)
because whey protein digests quickly so (97:06 - 97:12)
you have it before you workout so when (97:10 - 97:13)
you're lifting your muscles will have (97:12 - 97:17)
that available to use while you're (97:13 - 97:19)
working out and then right after you're (97:17 - 97:20)
working out so that your muscles can use (97:19 - 97:22)
that as part of their recovery process (97:20 - 97:25)
the other type of protein you want to (97:22 - 97:27)
invest in is and everybody always says I (97:25 - 97:30)
pronounce this wrong it's a casino or (97:27 - 97:35)
case in CA se I n that is a fun protein (97:30 - 97:38)
that when you shake it up it kind of (97:35 - 97:41)
foams and it's a little bit gelatinous (97:38 - 97:45)
Oh yikes no no no it's it's still (97:41 - 97:48)
drinkable it's it's like it just eat it (97:45 - 97:50)
tends to be more like bubbles then then (97:48 - 97:52)
you would expect from mocha from powder (97:50 - 97:56)
type thing um it does not turn into a (97:52 - 97:59)
jelly no but it's but it's important to (97:56 - 98:02)
understand that because case in protein (97:59 - 98:06)
is slow digesting so if you do a scoop (98:02 - 98:09)
of casein protein it's probably going to (98:06 - 98:11)
take about eight hours for that to (98:09 - 98:13)
digest through your system so what you (98:11 - 98:16)
typically do is you take case in at (98:13 - 98:18)
bedtime and when you wake up in the (98:16 - 98:20)
morning and then you've got 16 hours (98:18 - 98:23)
covered of protein in your system that (98:20 - 98:25)
your body can use for recovery and (98:23 - 98:29)
repair like just throughout that time so (98:25 - 98:29)
you take it (98:29 - 98:31)
or you go to bed you wake up huh (98:29 - 98:34)
straight to the gym no no no no no you (98:31 - 98:36)
take those cases over you go to bed okay (98:34 - 98:39)
now now has I don't learn in gym all (98:36 - 98:42)
right case cason you just like you have (98:39 - 98:43)
a nice big glass of that like I would (98:42 - 98:45)
say half an hour before you're planning (98:43 - 98:47)
on going to bed and then of course (98:45 - 98:51)
because rest is a very important part of (98:47 - 98:53)
muscle recovery you're going to get (98:51 - 98:57)
eight hours of sleep every night right (98:53 - 99:01)
okay so that case in is digesting during (98:57 - 99:03)
those eight hours of sleep you wake up (99:01 - 99:06)
in the morning and then you have another (99:03 - 99:08)
scoop of case in so typically what I do (99:06 - 99:10)
is I mix the case in with milk and then (99:08 - 99:12)
I pour my coffee into it so it's like (99:10 - 99:15)
chocolate coffee kind of protein deal (99:12 - 99:17)
I've never on instead of that but that (99:15 - 99:20)
sounds good yeah and then that gives you (99:17 - 99:22)
eight hours through the day while you're (99:20 - 99:25)
at your office job and then when you (99:22 - 99:26)
leave work you go and have a whey (99:25 - 99:29)
protein do your workout have another (99:26 - 99:31)
whey protein wagon they have your dinner (99:29 - 99:34)
clang in the writing I usually I've (99:31 - 99:36)
never I've never done case in powder and (99:34 - 99:38)
I have never tried Eric Aasen I've never (99:36 - 99:40)
tried it and I'm I'm not sure that I (99:38 - 99:43)
would necessarily oh I thought it's been (99:40 - 99:45)
transformative for me i really i would (99:43 - 99:47)
actually choose cason over whey protein (99:45 - 99:51)
after you we have a big big jug of UMP (99:47 - 99:56)
that we both dip into and we use that I (99:51 - 99:58)
don't know what that is it's just whey (99:56 - 100:02)
protein it's like on amazon i have not (99:58 - 100:04)
noticed anything transformative it also (100:02 - 100:07)
yeah i'm assuming it's not now first you (100:04 - 100:08)
got to get me out there and i will like (100:07 - 100:11)
whip you're at and you go into shape I (100:08 - 100:14)
will whip yourself into should good so (100:11 - 100:16)
the third thing I say we're getting (100:14 - 100:18)
things in this store that you want to (100:16 - 100:20)
look at is if you have a little bit of (100:18 - 100:22)
difficulty especially at the end of the (100:20 - 100:25)
workday going into the gym you want to (100:22 - 100:27)
look at a pre-workout which tends to be (100:25 - 100:31)
a high caffeine and then a few other (100:27 - 100:33)
things into kind of warm you up and get (100:31 - 100:36)
you moving so you would take a (100:33 - 100:38)
pre-workout about half an hour before (100:36 - 100:40)
you plan on working out and it just kind (100:38 - 100:42)
of energizes you to actually go and do (100:40 - 100:43)
your work out (100:42 - 100:45)
and I mean it depends on how much (100:43 - 100:47)
caffeine actually functions on you if (100:45 - 100:50)
you're a heavy coffee drinker a pre (100:47 - 100:51)
workouts not going to do that much for (100:50 - 100:54)
you in the long run but I don't do pre (100:51 - 100:56)
workout I don't have any problems (100:54 - 100:58)
getting motivated to go to the gym so (100:56 - 101:02)
but the other the key thing oh good lord (100:58 - 101:06)
hahaha the key thing about your protein (101:02 - 101:10)
intake uh is if you have not been doing (101:06 - 101:13)
protein powder step up to it gradually (101:10 - 101:16)
because if you go from like a daily (101:13 - 101:20)
intake of let's say 80 grams of protein (101:16 - 101:22)
every day and boost that up to a hundred (101:20 - 101:25)
and 80 grams of protein a day you are (101:22 - 101:28)
going to have stomach distress for about (101:25 - 101:31)
a week and a half while your body learns (101:28 - 101:33)
that oh I have to digest more protein (101:31 - 101:35)
every day I definitely when i first (101:33 - 101:37)
started at the beginning of this year (101:35 - 101:42)
going to the gym i took on the (101:37 - 101:46)
suggestion from my wife and my dad who (101:42 - 101:47)
we were all three of us were going to (101:46 - 101:50)
the gym together um that i should take (101:47 - 101:53)
some whey protein and i did and i felt (101:50 - 101:57)
terrible because i took way too much it (101:53 - 102:00)
was it was like probably one of the most (101:57 - 102:04)
uncomfortable stomach yep awkwardness (102:00 - 102:06)
that I've felt in a long time and it (102:04 - 102:12)
always like in the dog haha um and which (102:06 - 102:13)
you should target you don't just like (102:12 - 102:16)
gulp down protein like it doesn't matter (102:13 - 102:19)
how much protein what you should do is (102:16 - 102:22)
really and I mean it's just this is (102:19 - 102:24)
equally as important right the three (102:22 - 102:27)
pillars of getting your body into shape (102:24 - 102:29)
number one actually doing exercise (102:27 - 102:32)
number two getting actual rest number (102:29 - 102:35)
three nutrition so take the time and (102:32 - 102:38)
figure out what weight you want to get (102:35 - 102:42)
to and then do my preference is one gram (102:38 - 102:44)
of protein per pound of body weight that (102:42 - 102:48)
you want to get to some people say like (102:44 - 102:49)
if you're trying to if you're trying to (102:48 - 102:54)
get up to a higher weight do a gram and (102:49 - 102:55)
a half of protein for the weight you (102:54 - 102:57)
want to get to and if you want to get to (102:55 - 102:58)
a lower weight than maybe a little less (102:57 - 103:00)
than 1 gram of protein per the weight (102:58 - 103:02)
but I think a good target for people to (103:00 - 103:04)
hit one gram of protein per the weight (103:02 - 103:06)
that you want to get to so if you want (103:04 - 103:07)
to be a hundred eighty-five pounds if (103:06 - 103:10)
you think that's the right ideal body (103:07 - 103:13)
mass index for your height then you want (103:10 - 103:15)
to get 185 grams of protein every day (103:13 - 103:18)
and that's a mix of both the powders and (103:15 - 103:20)
everything and like the chicken that you (103:18 - 103:22)
eat the tuna that you eat look at your (103:20 - 103:25)
labels see how much protein is in those (103:22 - 103:27)
you have to add it all together to make (103:25 - 103:29)
sure that you're not overdoing it or (103:27 - 103:32)
under doing it I'll just need 12 steaks (103:29 - 103:34)
and then I go to the gym and I just rip (103:32 - 103:38)
sick weights all night I call right when (103:34 - 103:41)
I eat I eat 15 eggs and I have done a (103:38 - 103:43)
show back angle it back there yeah and I (103:41 - 103:45)
go back to the gym and I clanging bang (103:43 - 103:50)
for another 20 to 30 hours plugin yep I (103:45 - 103:53)
can make this relevant for him because I (103:50 - 103:54)
eat a lot of apples and I always think (103:53 - 103:56)
of that episode of The Simpsons where (103:54 - 104:00)
Homer like ate the apple bars oh yeah (103:56 - 104:04)
like super ripped I like three apples (104:00 - 104:08)
every day that's amazing all right good (104:04 - 104:11)

mythical will be a thing but we are not (104:44 - 104:50)
talking about dates or anything right (104:47 - 104:52)
now getting a lot of mythical emails (104:50 - 104:54)
recently I think people are getting the (104:52 - 104:58)
secret to everyone the itch so I I don't (104:54 - 105:00)
want to say something wrong (104:58 - 105:03)
I noticed that there are starting to be (105:00 - 105:09)
like knockoff knockoffs out there uh-oh (105:03 - 105:12)
I don't know if you notice Li noticed (105:09 - 105:15)
there's no they're just the other I'm (105:12 - 105:18)
just kidding D&D Pokemon podcasts that (105:15 - 105:21)
are now popping up look at this (105:18 - 105:24)
pioneering I mean I don't think mythical (105:21 - 105:26)
was a pioneer show I think they've (105:24 - 105:29)
existed come on man let me just let me (105:26 - 105:32)
just have a bit like cracks car have his (105:29 - 105:34)
moment let me just give you a compliment (105:32 - 105:36)
for once all right all right let's move (105:34 - 105:38)
on to our poke amount of the week and (105:36 - 105:40)
we'll wrap up the show will you want to (105:38 - 105:43)
read the move setter I will read the (105:40 - 105:44)
move set and you have to explain what it (105:43 - 105:52)
does alright alright so the Pokemon of (105:44 - 105:55)
the week this week is a lowland (105:52 - 105:59)
sandslash which i believe is an ice type (105:55 - 106:02)
if if my memory serves properly which i (105:59 - 106:06)
don't know why they didn't I seen / I (106:02 - 106:09)
steal well there you go so this is a (106:06 - 106:13)
lowland sam / with a life orb and if you (106:09 - 106:15)
recall the life orb is the one that (106:13 - 106:18)
takes a little bit of your life every (106:15 - 106:21)
turn but in exchange it increases the (106:18 - 106:24)
amount of attack for your attacking (106:21 - 106:29)
moves the ability is slush rush which is (106:24 - 106:34)
really hard for me to say and slush rush (106:29 - 106:39)
doubles speed in hail conditions so I (106:34 - 106:44)
guess you have to be in hail Travis (106:39 - 106:48)
actually wrote in to give us oh wait I'm (106:44 - 106:51)
sorry this is this is contributed by (106:48 - 106:55)
Gabe Brown from the from the slack (106:51 - 106:57)
community who is known as cool Gabe and (106:55 - 107:00)
has my favorite username in the entire (106:57 - 107:04)
slack community of cool Gabe so the move (107:00 - 107:08)
set is a nature adamant nature do your (107:04 - 107:14)
Eevee's 32 HP 252 attack 224 in speed (107:08 - 107:17)
and then your moves are icicle crash (107:14 - 107:22)
ironhead rockslide and protect and they (107:17 - 107:25)
say like a fine wine it pairs well with (107:22 - 107:28)
a lowland nine tails because a lowland (107:25 - 107:31)
nine tails will have the snow warning (107:28 - 107:33)
ability that causes hail so then slush (107:31 - 107:35)
rush will kick in and it will double the (107:33 - 107:40)
speed and it appears that this build is (107:35 - 107:44)
intended to be a sweeper so that (107:40 - 107:46)
basically means after you've kind of (107:44 - 107:49)
lowered your opponents down a little bit (107:46 - 107:51)
it comes in and cleans up but I (107:49 - 107:54)
understand that's how things work should (107:51 - 107:57)
be called a faulty leader the kilometer (107:54 - 107:59)
the house cleaner and the house winner (107:57 - 108:02)
name your sand / the house cleaner (107:59 - 108:04)
Travis says that slush rush doubles the (108:02 - 108:07)
speed inhale and alone 19 tells ability (108:04 - 108:09)
snow warning causes immediate hail so (108:07 - 108:10)
that is the reason for the pairing which (108:09 - 108:13)
what will said life as long as the nine (108:10 - 108:16)
tails is the slower right because if (108:13 - 108:18)
your it's your nine tails vs my giggle (108:16 - 108:20)
if and my giggle at the slower you're (108:18 - 108:24)
getting a sandstorm dude yeah and Gabe (108:20 - 108:26)
also mentioned earthquake isn't great (108:24 - 108:28)
for doubles because of things like taboo (108:26 - 108:31)
bulu so that is why earthquake is not on (108:28 - 108:33)
this move set which I think somebody (108:31 - 108:35)
asked to follow up in slack of why there (108:33 - 108:38)
was no earthquake so some trivia no (108:35 - 108:40)
other Pokemon is the same type (108:38 - 108:43)
combination as a lowland sand / and its (108:40 - 108:46)
pre evolution is the only ice steel (108:43 - 108:48)
Pokemon (108:46 - 108:50)
uh in the pokemon red and blue beta San (108:48 - 108:53)
slashes original name was Sam storm (108:50 - 108:56)
sandslash and its pre evolution share (108:53 - 108:58)
their category with rent at Redick aid (108:56 - 109:00)
Picchu and raichu they're all known as (108:58 - 109:03)
the mouse Pokemon though ranta and Radek (109:00 - 109:06)
aid have been called the rat pokemon (109:03 - 109:08)
before which i think we had this whole (109:06 - 109:10)
conversation when we did a low and ride (109:08 - 109:15)
you yup so yeah there you go is shiny is (109:10 - 109:19)
and I don't know what the lowland shiny (109:15 - 109:21)
is but regulars hand / while it's tan (109:19 - 109:26)
with brown spikes shiny sand / is more (109:21 - 109:30)
grayish brown with blood red spikes that (109:26 - 109:32)
would be my description blood red it's (109:30 - 109:36)
real rich dark red hood red dark red (109:32 - 109:38)
fifty percent male fifty percent female (109:36 - 109:41)
it can also get snow cloak as another (109:38 - 109:45)
durability yeah so there you go some (109:41 - 109:48)
some a lowland sand / so there you go (109:45 - 109:51)
you can hopefully use that for future (109:48 - 109:53)
teams now let's do some housecleaning (109:51 - 109:56)

throughout the episodes he lives in (111:31 - 111:34)
Boston he's kind of been the one (111:32 - 111:36)
organizing this so we just probably need (111:34 - 111:38)
a headcount and it will probably not be (111:36 - 111:41)
