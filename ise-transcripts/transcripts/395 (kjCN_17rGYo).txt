only a day later I forgot (0:46 - 0:53)
I'm your host SBJ with me Greg hello (0:49 - 0:56)
it's snowing so I'm hoping that by the (0:53 - 0:58)
time we're done recording it will not be (0:56 - 1:00)
snowing and I can go get food cuz I'm (0:58 - 1:05)
hungry and we'll also hear and it's also (1:00 - 1:08)
snowing on my end of the city but I had (1:05 - 1:11)
three breakfast burritos or the grocery (1:08 - 1:16)
store closed so I mean I'd keep (1:11 - 1:18)
breakfast burritos in the freezer where (1:16 - 1:21)
they belong and then it's like but none (1:18 - 1:23)
hungry I take one out heat it up 90 (1:21 - 1:24)
seconds let it sit on the plate for two (1:23 - 1:27)
minutes good to go I would never do that (1:24 - 1:29)

form and I've (3:43 - 3:48)
zero amps form I caught one last night (3:44 - 3:51)
but I think it was an amped form (3:48 - 3:51)
yeah yeah I mean they really uh I think (3:52 - 3:58)
we talked about this before the game (3:57 - 4:01)
came out they're really taking advantage (3:58 - 4:04)
of both games here I mean as they should (4:01 - 4:06)
give us some value for having two (4:04 - 4:08)
different games oh that's true that's (4:06 - 4:11)
very that's that's true I mean it's nice (4:08 - 4:14)
that you don't need to have both games (4:11 - 4:15)
you just need to either jump into (4:14 - 4:19)
somebody's raid and or find a friend who (4:15 - 4:22)
it doesn't have the same copy as you we (4:19 - 4:23)
talked about military being promoted (4:22 - 4:26)
right yep we talked last week about how (4:23 - 4:29)
the star and the WoW is my memory (4:26 - 4:32)
emitted ribbons sweets are now available (4:29 - 4:34)
which they weren't previously yes I (4:32 - 4:38)
caught 59 of them I was gonna say 60 but (4:34 - 4:42)
I was using Silve allied to battle them (4:38 - 4:44)
which is taking up one battle spot one (4:42 - 4:48)
box spot I caught 59 of them two too (4:44 - 4:48)

I never want to catch another one again (4:48 - 4:53)
I have a lot I don't know that I have (4:51 - 4:55)
all the farms but I don't want all the (4:53 - 4:57)
form specific some of the forms don't (4:55 - 5:00)
look good it's all or nothing Greg nope (4:57 - 5:04)
it is in the middle or nothing (5:00 - 5:06)
you have to get them all shiny I haven't (5:04 - 5:08)
seen a shiny one yeah but you don't want (5:06 - 5:11)
to catch them a shiny catching 50 of (5:08 - 5:16)
them doesn't suddenly turn on me so are (5:11 - 5:18)
we gonna do you guys want to talk about (5:16 - 5:20)
how tax tricity is actually the pokemon (5:18 - 5:22)
on the side of the hill is it yeah yeah (5:20 - 5:25)
pokemon at the lighthouse (5:22 - 5:27)
it is the pokemon of the lighthouse yeah (5:25 - 5:30)
cuz the lighthouse has two statues of (5:27 - 5:32)
tax tricity oh yeah yeah but when you (5:30 - 5:35)
first arrive into my lowest town I can't (5:32 - 5:37)
remember what it's called probably first (5:35 - 5:41)
no no what chirst is the first time with (5:37 - 5:44)
the transition yeah mulberry is where (5:41 - 5:47)
nessa is hammerlock is obviously in the (5:44 - 5:49)
middle (5:47 - 5:49)
wind ins no no wind ins final city motor (5:50 - 5:58)
stock also city in middle anyways the (5:54 - 6:01)
city with the the pump caboose and the (5:58 - 6:04)
the rocks and the whoo lose and the mile (6:01 - 6:08)
oh wow and the stone henges and the (6:04 - 6:11)
stoner cut out cardboard cut-out you (6:08 - 6:14)
know when you see the giant hill and (6:11 - 6:15)
that's kind of when you start hearing (6:14 - 6:16)
about the darkest day for the first time (6:15 - 6:20)
you see a Pokemon (6:16 - 6:22)
and that Pokemon is specifically GMAC (6:20 - 6:25)
stalks tricity it's got its tail yeah it (6:22 - 6:29)
has the tail dialer is that like what is (6:25 - 6:31)
that that was so confusing to me (6:29 - 6:34)
it's turf field turf field yeah it's its (6:31 - 6:38)
tail guitar yeah you can so it's so (6:34 - 6:41)
specifically they're sort of things that (6:38 - 6:45)
system well toxicity plays notes with (6:41 - 6:49)
his chest yeah so the eye is exactly the (6:45 - 6:51)
same the spikes down the back and then (6:49 - 6:54)
the tail are the three giveaways I don't (6:51 - 6:56)
know what the little things around (6:54 - 6:59)
toxicities feet are on the hill people (6:56 - 7:01)
getting wrecked I think it's supposed to (6:59 - 7:03)
be just the heat like people yes (7:01 - 7:05)
somebody was like alright smelt and I (7:03 - 7:07)
was like no Milton has one I not - I (7:05 - 7:10)
don't think specifically its it smelt an (7:07 - 7:14)
but like all Pokemon games they do a (7:10 - 7:17)
really bad job at fleshing out a full (7:14 - 7:20)
story and I'm sure the anime will answer (7:17 - 7:23)
these questions probably because let me (7:20 - 7:24)
tell you (7:23 - 7:26)
ultra subtle well let get all games have (7:24 - 7:28)
this but I'll just an ultra moon really (7:26 - 7:30)
bad at telling you all of alternate (7:28 - 7:34)
Crossley's desires and issues and the (7:30 - 7:36)
anime does a pretty okay job summing (7:34 - 7:38)
that up and you're like boy and you have (7:36 - 7:41)
to leave something for the anime yeah (7:38 - 7:41)
that's true I guess (7:41 - 7:43)
oh boy sword and shield has left a lot (7:41 - 7:49)
for the anime they entire ending yes (7:43 - 7:50)
exactly (7:49 - 7:53)
yep hey will you beat sword shield I (7:50 - 7:56)
mean I haven't finished the postgame (7:53 - 7:59)
back up to the credits yes I have (7:56 - 8:02)
I defeated the undefeatable champion (7:59 - 8:04)
story aside what do you think of that (8:02 - 8:09)
fight the battle with Leon yeah uh it (8:04 - 8:11)
was it was it was tough it was it was a (8:09 - 8:12)
pretty good battle I mean I still beat (8:11 - 8:16)
him in one try but yeah I mean you kinda (8:12 - 8:19)
kind of went in knowing that the thing I (8:16 - 8:21)
was really gonna have to contend it with (8:19 - 8:24)
was a big old Charizard so I had a plan (8:21 - 8:31)
for that game so the other dudes were a (8:24 - 8:34)
little bit of fluff that I had to work (8:31 - 8:36)
my way through I think what was the one (8:34 - 8:38)
that gave me the the most difficulty (8:36 - 8:39)
well you opens with aegislash (8:38 - 8:43)
and then he has a Haxorus and he might (8:39 - 8:45)
depending on the version you have he (8:43 - 8:47)
might have seismitoad oh you know what (8:45 - 8:52)
Haxorus was tough for me because it it (8:47 - 8:55)
use Iron Tail on Myra bomby and I was (8:52 - 8:56)
just like wasn't expecting that and I (8:55 - 8:58)
thought ro Bobby was gonna 1-shot it and (8:56 - 9:03)
it well it didn't the music's really (8:58 - 9:06)
good I think that whole fight is one of (9:03 - 9:08)
the most memorable memorable fights in (9:06 - 9:11)
all the Pokemon I mean I don't think (9:08 - 9:13)
I'll remember it um except for it okay (9:11 - 9:14)
here's here's what I really liked about (9:13 - 9:17)
stadium battles and honestly if I could (9:14 - 9:19)
have a lot more Stadium battles in this (9:17 - 9:20)
game I would be thrilled like if there (9:19 - 9:22)
was some way I could just like keep (9:20 - 9:24)
doing stadium battles I believe the (9:22 - 9:32)
competitive sure that when year you (9:24 - 9:34)
faint your opponent's Pokemon the ball (9:32 - 9:36)
guy image in the background does a (9:34 - 9:39)
little faint yeah graphic and then when (9:36 - 9:42)
they Giganta max the ball guy image in (9:39 - 9:43)
the background like gets all big I (9:42 - 9:45)
thought that was fantastic I love that (9:43 - 9:48)
ball guy best guy he could be either (9:45 - 9:50)
male or female that's what his league (9:48 - 9:53)
card said that's true that's very true (9:50 - 9:55)
don't know who who ball guy is under (9:53 - 9:57)
that suit did you have any thoughts (9:55 - 9:59)
about the fight with oleanna (9:57 - 10:03)
just it was it was it funny that like (9:59 - 10:05)
that she has all these like beauty (10:03 - 10:10)
Pokemon and then at the end (10:05 - 10:13)
because I guess she just wanted to win (10:10 - 10:15)
well the girl I don't know if you you (10:13 - 10:18)
I'll wait till you get to her other Li (10:15 - 10:20)
card there's a reason she has the car (10:18 - 10:21)
Broder wait (10:20 - 10:22)
Oh Deanna has a league card why would (10:21 - 10:25)
she have kalique cards every Lenny has (10:22 - 10:28)
ally carda heavily card it might not be (10:25 - 10:30)
her only card it might be chairman roses (10:28 - 10:33)
secondly card which she writes chairman (10:30 - 10:38)
roses Li card which I might have like (10:33 - 10:41)
story about her in it for anyone who (10:38 - 10:43)
doesn't want the spoiler if you beat the (10:41 - 10:47)
game go to the gallery mine's one after (10:43 - 10:50)
you beat Leon and you will find Oleanna (10:47 - 10:52)
and another Li card there I'm just (10:50 - 10:54)
chasing after some weirdos is what I'm (10:52 - 10:58)
doing right now oh the best so many (10:54 - 11:00)
questions I ask you well now that you've (10:58 - 11:02)
been the game how did you feel about the (11:00 - 11:07)
eternities fight I I don't understand (11:02 - 11:10)
okay first Leon says I got this needed (11:07 - 11:12)
all tired out that's where I was a (11:10 - 11:15)
Pokeball doesn't capture and okay so (11:12 - 11:17)
since when did a Pokemon escaping from a (11:15 - 11:20)
pokeball become so violent that the (11:17 - 11:22)
Charizard had to spin around and protect (11:20 - 11:24)
me and my buddy from the explosive (11:22 - 11:27)
action of okay so that was number one (11:24 - 11:29)
Charizard real hero of the game then say (11:27 - 11:34)
of the Wu he saves you who saves hop (11:29 - 11:37)
that's just because Leon did not (11:34 - 11:40)
understand what he was doing did just (11:37 - 11:41)
thought it was a simple easy fight and (11:40 - 11:46)
completely misjudged the situation still (11:41 - 11:49)
I have never had failed to catch a (11:46 - 11:51)
Pokemon in a pokeball and then been (11:49 - 11:54)
gruesomely more mutilated by the (11:51 - 11:56)
explosive power of the Pokemon popping (11:54 - 11:58)
back out of the pokeball that's not yeah (11:56 - 12:00)
it's not how the pokeballs are designed (11:58 - 12:02)
so then number two you don't know that (12:00 - 12:04)
you die you've never thrown 200 (12:02 - 12:06)
pokeballs at a mall trace on the top of (12:04 - 12:08)
the Sevi island you don't know how many (12:06 - 12:10)
of those were shattered in your face I (12:08 - 12:13)
have thrown quite a few pokeballs in my (12:10 - 12:14)
life thank you (12:13 - 12:19)
so then I fight eternities and I (12:14 - 12:21)
defeated it (12:19 - 12:24)
cept it's not to feed it I mean I (12:21 - 12:26)
knocked it out it's the same as in (12:24 - 12:27)
across ma it's literally the same fight (12:26 - 12:30)
you fight regular you fight in the Cosmo (12:27 - 12:32)
who took over so so gaily early Nala (12:30 - 12:34)
and then you got a chase through a (12:32 - 12:36)
wormhole fight it again this time at the (12:34 - 12:38)
begging yeah but that's runaway this one (12:36 - 12:43)
was like it was on the ground like I got (12:38 - 12:44)
you bud (12:43 - 12:47)
but then it turns into some weird (12:44 - 12:51)
spinning snake hand that thing that's (12:47 - 12:53)
the best part of that whole fight (12:51 - 12:55)
gigantic oh the gigantic max version of (12:53 - 12:58)
it but it doesn't it can't Dynomax so (12:55 - 13:01)
not yet yeah I can I (12:58 - 13:03)
chairman Rose has been feeling feeling (13:01 - 13:06)
at candy's for like twenty thousand (13:03 - 13:09)
years I thought the eternities couldn't (13:06 - 13:12)
Dynomax they can't once you caught it (13:09 - 13:17)
and Giganta maxes well okay whatever (13:12 - 13:20)
what is it supposed to represent the (13:17 - 13:24)
darkest day but but no outside of that (13:20 - 13:29)
it's it's like a Hydra wha okay okay (13:24 - 13:33)
so it's you're there it's got the spin (13:29 - 13:35)
ease and it's got this weird hand thing (13:33 - 13:36)
which is like why don't you just grab me (13:35 - 13:38)
and crush me because that'd save us all (13:36 - 13:42)
a whole lot of time mr. weird dragon (13:38 - 13:43)
head hand thing does that it doesn't (13:42 - 13:47)
crush you because the the wolves show up (13:43 - 13:49)
well they got knocked out pretty early (13:47 - 13:55)
in that battle so there's a lot in that (13:49 - 13:57)
battle too yeah that's very true oh yeah (13:55 - 13:59)
it turned to this took those dudes out (13:57 - 14:02)
really [ __ ] they were in the fight by (13:59 - 14:06)
entire time mm-hmm especially zosky n (14:02 - 14:10)
got went real quick so some superhero (14:06 - 14:13)
you were buddy during that battle you (14:10 - 14:15)
see flashes of like images from all (14:13 - 14:20)
around Galler yeah because why what what (14:15 - 14:24)
was that from they don't explain a lot I (14:20 - 14:26)
mean they sort of explain my game would (14:24 - 14:29)
night I mean the little that they do try (14:26 - 14:30)
to explain which you sort of have to (14:29 - 14:33)
really work hard to piece together is (14:30 - 14:35)
it's showing you the places that it's (14:33 - 14:38)
connected it was connected to or still (14:35 - 14:40)
is connected to because those are the (14:38 - 14:43)
places that ever that are hotspots for (14:40 - 14:45)
Dinah maxing so you're supposed to be (14:43 - 14:49)
seeing those spots in those areas why (14:45 - 14:51)
they're showing up no clue doesn't (14:49 - 14:55)
bother to explain it to you why it is (14:51 - 14:58)
bothering to show you that no clue (14:55 - 15:01)
doesn't bother to explain it to it's (14:58 - 15:04)
just that hey because of its impact (15:01 - 15:07)
after the darkest day all these places (15:04 - 15:10)
could Dynomax because of reasons it was (15:07 - 15:12)
the reason that those places got (15:10 - 15:16)
infected powered up don't it's like the (15:12 - 15:18)
all the wishing stars which are pieces (15:16 - 15:22)
of eternities or something but the other (15:18 - 15:25)
there's just so many questions this is (15:22 - 15:30)
it the main thing is I have never and (15:25 - 15:32)
this is a thing I frequently go back to (15:30 - 15:36)
but never so much as at the end of this (15:32 - 15:39)
game have I thought to myself it must (15:36 - 15:42)
make sense in Japanese and they just (15:39 - 15:51)
couldn't translate yeah like this X&Y (15:42 - 15:54)
has a significantly worse story X&Y has (15:51 - 15:57)
a worse story but x and y's story is (15:54 - 15:59)
laid out in a way that makes sense and (15:57 - 16:08)
it's thorough you know exactly why (15:59 - 16:11)
they're doing what they're doing and (16:08 - 16:13)
whether what they're doing makes sense (16:11 - 16:16)
or should be done no but you know it's (16:13 - 16:19)
like they want to accomplish this so (16:16 - 16:20)
these are the steps that they are taking (16:19 - 16:22)
to accomplish this literally in this (16:20 - 16:25)
game it's and and I know that you feel (16:22 - 16:27)
it's like oh the adults were keeping it (16:25 - 16:30)
from the children but still it's like if (16:27 - 16:32)
I was reading a novel and I got to the (16:30 - 16:34)
last five pages of the novel it's like (16:32 - 16:35)
here's the real story that you weren't (16:34 - 16:37)
reading about because we were keeping it (16:35 - 16:41)
from you got my money back friend but (16:37 - 16:45)
the chairman Rose was this dude hanging (16:41 - 16:47)
out in boo (16:45 - 16:50)
shorts at the seafood restaurant and (16:47 - 16:53)
then all of a sudden he's very impatient (16:50 - 16:55)
about bringing about the end of the (16:53 - 16:57)
world wide circle and that's like a (16:55 - 17:00)
standard trope though of what no there's (16:57 - 17:03)
just no there's no explanation behind it (17:00 - 17:06)
like like if they even had said we've (17:03 - 17:08)
been using eternity as the power source (17:06 - 17:12)
for Galler and if we don't let him go (17:08 - 17:16)
he's gonna run out of steam and we've (17:12 - 17:19)
got to rejuvenate and but they never (17:16 - 17:21)
even said that much he does say that (17:19 - 17:24)
there does say that he does say the (17:21 - 17:29)
first time you get to hammer lock hammer (17:24 - 17:32)
lock that they have an energy problem (17:29 - 17:35)
and they need to solve it soon and the (17:32 - 17:39)
energy problem is a turnit as' but (17:35 - 17:40)
although he does say that but what I'm (17:39 - 17:43)
gonna argue that soon meaning we're (17:40 - 17:45)
gonna run out of power in a thousand (17:43 - 17:49)
years yeah that's a wild way to say soon (17:45 - 17:52)
like the thing that's lacking is his (17:49 - 17:57)
motivation to do it now yeah like hand (17:52 - 18:02)
in a very like now unstructured uh I (17:57 - 18:05)
mean you can you can project a lot on to (18:02 - 18:08)
it but that's all projection it's not (18:05 - 18:11)
coming from the actual narrative of the (18:08 - 18:14)
of the tale it's just it's so (18:11 - 18:17)
unsatisfying like even if they had said (18:14 - 18:19)
if chairman Rose had said I provoked (18:17 - 18:21)
this to happen because I want Leon to (18:19 - 18:24)
capture eternities you know so that we (18:21 - 18:26)
can you know rethink the energy (18:24 - 18:28)
structure of galleries say that one (18:26 - 18:30)
phrase but never is that said we're just (18:28 - 18:34)
assuming that he provoked this to happen (18:30 - 18:36)
and and maybe it had to happen before (18:34 - 18:38)
the championship battle cuz he knew Leon (18:36 - 18:39)
was gonna lose and then he was like I (18:38 - 18:43)
don't want you to have a turn it is yeah (18:39 - 18:45)
but Leon would have been easier to (18:43 - 18:47)
manipulate after he lost and was feeling (18:45 - 18:49)
bad about himself well except that he (18:47 - 18:51)
wouldn't run to save the gallery cuz (18:49 - 18:53)
he's not the champion anymore so he's (18:51 - 18:54)
like that's not my champion duty dude (18:53 - 18:57)
you're the winner go good luck I would (18:54 - 18:59)
there's a lot about what chairman Rose (18:57 - 19:02)
and why his time frame is the time frame (18:59 - 19:04)
that they just don't say like I (19:02 - 19:07)
absolutely agree that chairman roses (19:04 - 19:10)
entire reason for doing what he does is (19:07 - 19:14)
left just (19:10 - 19:17)
- speculative it's just like well why (19:14 - 19:21)
like like why we know Lysander is a (19:17 - 19:24)
nutjob who either wants to kill all (19:21 - 19:26)
people or kill all pokemons depending on (19:24 - 19:29)
which game you're playing and the way (19:26 - 19:31)
that he's going to do it is to reignite (19:29 - 19:34)
the three thousand-year-old weapon right (19:31 - 19:36)
we know that because it they make that (19:34 - 19:39)
very clear in the game that's like (19:36 - 19:42)
that's like start and stop the entire (19:39 - 19:44)
thing that Leo Lysander provides that (19:42 - 19:47)
dude has still rode depth getting (19:44 - 19:51)
getting more Ben I got from sword and (19:47 - 19:53)
shield I don't know I would like like I (19:51 - 19:57)
I'm not gonna say that the ending or the (19:53 - 19:59)
I think the ending is fine in sword and (19:57 - 20:01)
shield I think my I've already voiced (19:59 - 20:03)
all those complaints about how they (20:01 - 20:04)
could have said one or two things to (20:03 - 20:06)
clear up chairman rose but chairman (20:04 - 20:10)
roses more interesting from start to (20:06 - 20:12)
finish as a character and I would rather (20:10 - 20:15)
be left with more questions and wanting (20:12 - 20:16)
to see more which I'm sure the expansion (20:15 - 20:20)
will do on that than to be like I know (20:16 - 20:24)
nothing about Lysander and I don't I (20:20 - 20:26)
have no questions about Lysander he's (20:24 - 20:29)
just a rich dude that wears a red suit (20:26 - 20:32)
that wants to blow up the world like (20:29 - 20:35)
he's so he's such a boring character we (20:32 - 20:36)
didn't know nothing about (20:35 - 20:39)
Lysander we knew a lot about him the (20:36 - 20:43)
entire game like constantly yes you (20:39 - 20:47)
never get any of the text bubbles and (20:43 - 20:50)
why he was like they explained my (20:47 - 20:53)
Sanders character you can decide that (20:50 - 20:55)
it's boring because it is a terrible (20:53 - 20:58)
trope but (20:55 - 21:00)
Rose is also a terrible trope that they (20:58 - 21:04)
don't bother explaining (21:00 - 21:04)
I mean Rose has more (21:04 - 21:10)
roses only more interesting because of (21:08 - 21:14)
Oleanna and you know it also kind of (21:10 - 21:18)
also puts a emphasis on this is I have (21:14 - 21:22)
gotten more out of the two weirdos and (21:18 - 21:26)
their motivation then I got about any of (21:22 - 21:28)
roses motivation throughout the entire (21:26 - 21:30)
get is also true yeah the minimum (21:28 - 21:32)
cutscene it's like you know and it's (21:30 - 21:36)
like you were saying like why why did (21:32 - 21:37)
they put up the mural in front of the (21:36 - 21:39)
carving that's in the mountainside right (21:37 - 21:41)
that got destroyed by the Kaaba Raja or (21:39 - 21:44)
whatever and they make that very clear (21:41 - 21:47)
it's like their family put that up to (21:44 - 21:50)
hide what actually happened right right (21:47 - 21:52)
and it's like oh but I know all this (21:50 - 21:55)
just from a few lines of dialog that (21:52 - 21:57)
they put why couldn't they have done the (21:55 - 22:00)
same in like taking us to you a seafood (21:57 - 22:02)
restaurant and having a sit there and (22:00 - 22:04)
having a seat that's just I just feel (22:02 - 22:07)
like like they they cut something out (22:04 - 22:09)
and they didn't need to (22:07 - 22:14)
I don't and you know also this really (22:09 - 22:19)
really underscores is I found that the (22:14 - 22:22)
arcs in the story about like Sonja and (22:19 - 22:26)
bead and Marnie and piers and like all (22:22 - 22:29)
the different human relationships that (22:26 - 22:31)
weren't the the Grand Opera part of the (22:29 - 22:33)
story to be so much more interesting and (22:31 - 22:35)
fun to be part of they are Tori is the (22:33 - 22:39)
best story and it's like you know what (22:35 - 22:41)
take this as your lesson learned Pokemon (22:39 - 22:43)
make the next game just a slice of life (22:41 - 22:46)
anime right we don't need any grant (22:43 - 22:50)
disaster just make it like boy today for (22:46 - 22:53)
a year for almost 10 years I mean I (22:50 - 22:56)
disagree but because I don't need a game (22:53 - 22:59)
where I'm saving the world I don't need (22:56 - 23:04)
that in like that's let me just try it (22:59 - 23:08)
just try it you know you two are always (23:04 - 23:10)
willing to try new stuff try this the (23:08 - 23:12)
new stuff worth it I mean this was (23:10 - 23:14)
really their opportunity to do it (23:12 - 23:16)
because the whole structure of the the (23:14 - 23:18)
gym challenge it's so nice and (23:16 - 23:21)
refreshing and it's just like (23:18 - 23:24)
would integrate so well of like here's (23:21 - 23:26)
the four or five six of us on our (23:24 - 23:28)
journey and it's like how do our (23:26 - 23:31)
different human relationships impact how (23:28 - 23:33)
we do on the journey and learn and grow (23:31 - 23:37)
over time I guess so that that part of (23:33 - 23:39)
it is so good and it's so just like left (23:37 - 23:41)
on the side I mean this was the game (23:39 - 23:46)
where they didn't actually have well (23:41 - 23:48)
they they still had like a bad team but (23:46 - 23:53)
there's no like bad team moment I guess (23:48 - 23:55)
I guess there's that kind of is the only (23:53 - 23:57)
item I was like yeah yeah I wasn't but (23:55 - 24:00)
like that has an old key when they sit (23:57 - 24:02)
basically say hey all these corporations (24:00 - 24:04)
are working against you take that (24:02 - 24:06)
corporate sponsors (24:04 - 24:08)
so that's it I'll continue playing I'll (24:06 - 24:11)
play shield eventually well post (24:08 - 24:12)
expansion Vesta can have your perfect (24:11 - 24:15)
team I don't know if I can wait that (24:12 - 24:19)
long it's only June (24:15 - 24:22)
I know but it's like well I I'm gonna (24:19 - 24:27)
have animal crossing just wait for my (24:22 - 24:29)
critiques of animal crossing and how (24:27 - 24:36)
crummy that store sure there is no story (24:29 - 24:40)
I mean I guess the basic story of the (24:36 - 24:45)
real story that is life like the most (24:40 - 24:47)
boring yeah it's the story of life (24:45 - 24:50)
called a mortgage and a raccoon it's not (24:47 - 24:52)
gonna let you'd be until you pay off (24:50 - 24:53)
that mortgage (24:52 - 24:57)
I'll pull weeds IRL but I'll pull weeds (24:53 - 25:00)
and Animal Crossing I just I don't think (24:57 - 25:03)
I can bring myself to play that game (25:00 - 25:07)
animal crossing yeah Greg (25:03 - 25:09)
yeah I played the other ones so what's (25:07 - 25:12)
the issue this the issue that I have (25:09 - 25:14)
with all of them is that I play them for (25:12 - 25:16)
about a week and then they really begin (25:14 - 25:19)
to resent the game or making me like I (25:16 - 25:22)
can't take a break I have to be there (25:19 - 25:24)
every day people like the things that I (25:22 - 25:27)
want reg life doesn't stop yeah but I (25:24 - 25:30)
can take breaks from life I can I can (25:27 - 25:32)
take breaks I don't fall apart here's (25:30 - 25:35)
the secret you find people who are super (25:32 - 25:37)
Animal Crossing fanatics and they exist (25:35 - 25:40)
out there and then you're like hey dude (25:37 - 25:43)
I'm gonna leave my train station open (25:40 - 25:45)
all day so could you just come over and (25:43 - 25:47)
pick all my weeds for me and lay down (25:45 - 25:49)
some paths and and I have pretty up the (25:47 - 25:51)
place maybe replant some of these trees (25:49 - 25:53)
in the right area so we have groves and (25:51 - 25:55)
these people will be like well I already (25:53 - 25:58)
did all that in my town so yeah I'll (25:55 - 26:04)
just come over - no no you got a I'm not (25:58 - 26:06)
gonna name names but there's a certain (26:04 - 26:09)
person who lives in Canada near Ottawa (26:06 - 26:11)
that I'm sure is enough of a fanatic (26:09 - 26:14)
because they literally reset their own (26:11 - 26:16)
town so that they can keep doing this (26:14 - 26:18)
stuff over and over again I'm sure (26:16 - 26:20)
they're gonna be real happy to just have (26:18 - 26:26)
access to other people's towns like put (26:20 - 26:27)
those things here oh man you got to give (26:26 - 26:31)
up some control no (26:27 - 26:35)
and then just enjoy the experience why (26:31 - 26:37)
by playing the game so that when pavé (26:35 - 26:39)
shows up you can do his little paw (26:37 - 26:45)
favoritos game the worst part about it (26:39 - 26:47)
is I'm gonna be peer pressured into (26:45 - 26:49)
playing Animal Crossing like his peer (26:47 - 26:52)
pressured into playing magic and you (26:49 - 26:59)
love playing magic now I love parts I (26:52 - 26:59)
will say the last animal crossing there (26:59 - 27:05)
was a lake there I I do agree with Greg (27:02 - 27:07)
there was like a social because when (27:05 - 27:10)
wild world came out (27:07 - 27:13)
there was no Twitter at the time (27:10 - 27:15)
maybe they're no they're definitely no (27:13 - 27:19)
there wasn't and then I bought and (27:15 - 27:20)
played the we won but I didn't love it (27:19 - 27:24)
so I only played it for like two days um (27:20 - 27:26)
oh I played the we won the most and then (27:24 - 27:28)
when I had everything in that game new (27:26 - 27:32)
leaf came out I felt like this social (27:28 - 27:36)
pressure of like everyone playing a lot (27:32 - 27:38)
and I wasn't being able to keep like I (27:36 - 27:40)
wasn't keeping up fast enough and then (27:38 - 27:41)
like people would be like oh I got the (27:40 - 27:43)
lighthouse or I got the police station (27:41 - 27:45)
or I got the cafe and it's like I don't (27:43 - 27:47)
have those but they're all orangey you (27:45 - 27:50)
can't you can only do so much to like (27:47 - 27:53)
hopefully get those public work projects (27:50 - 27:56)
to appear so it's like I'm so far behind (27:53 - 28:00)
that person has a cafe that person has (27:56 - 28:03)
like four four fossils completely done (28:00 - 28:05)
and I keep getting this Triceratops (28:03 - 28:09)
booty well and then my favorite animals (28:05 - 28:13)
leave not if you treat them right yeah (28:09 - 28:18)
oh I want mmm I have I have I have spent (28:13 - 28:20)
a ton of time on very specific creatures (28:18 - 28:23)
giving them everything they want doing (28:20 - 28:24)
everything and they're like I'm thinking (28:23 - 28:26)
of leaving and then I'll say like no (28:24 - 28:29)
please don't and they're like oh you're (28:26 - 28:31)
too attached to me me leaving would be (28:29 - 28:39)
good for ya I will say that for this (28:31 - 28:42)
town because my last town literally has (28:39 - 28:45)
what the final message I left for my (28:42 - 28:49)
town was this is now yours don't mess it (28:45 - 28:51)
up I'm gonna go play a fun game it's (28:49 - 28:53)
called Pokemon and then he's perfectly (28:51 - 28:56)
tacked to the to the building Lord of my (28:53 - 29:00)
last out maybe your animals (28:56 - 29:03)
have shared the same personality traits (29:00 - 29:05)
with Chairman rose where they do have a (29:03 - 29:07)
good reason but they just need to leave (29:05 - 29:10)
right now (29:07 - 29:10)
I just have to leave Gregg this is for (29:11 - 29:15)
the best (29:14 - 29:17)
I want that come the ones that come back (29:15 - 29:20)
are awful the ones that move in are like (29:17 - 29:23)
the worst it's not crappy some crabby (29:20 - 29:26)
bunny who's just like ruining the my (29:23 - 29:28)
good works well I have to you have to (29:26 - 29:30)
work to change its attitude by being (29:28 - 29:34)
friendly to it and giving it nice things (29:30 - 29:34)
I'm all right Crossing town we set up a (29:35 - 29:42)
giant flower cannon we face it toward (29:40 - 29:48)
the sky yes and if you leave I'm set it (29:42 - 29:52)
off I will I will say I'm when I start (29:48 - 29:54)
this new Animal Crossing I will do it on (29:52 - 29:56)
my own without anybody else around (29:54 - 29:57)
because I think that was a huge mistake (29:56 - 30:00)
starting the last one because there was (29:57 - 30:02)
just too much conflict over who gets (30:00 - 30:04)
what face and what town layout was the (30:02 - 30:06)
good way out first the bow you weren't (30:04 - 30:08)
there but I don't think I was very (30:06 - 30:11)
either you were and it was even worse (30:08 - 30:14)
because I like had to double by an ace (30:11 - 30:17)
oh don't you there's a quiz and then you (30:14 - 30:19)
show out you get a different face the (30:17 - 30:21)
different is the quiz and the new one I (30:19 - 30:22)
think you just design your characters (30:21 - 30:25)
face that's fine I still don't want to (30:22 - 30:26)
any be around anybody who's gonna say (30:25 - 30:31)
well I wanted that face like I want the (30:26 - 30:38)
face you have probably not not discuss (30:31 - 30:40)
it's discussed about social media and (30:38 - 30:42)
just like play the game on my own and (30:40 - 30:44)
you know ask my expert friends for (30:42 - 30:46)
advice when I need advice but yeah that (30:44 - 30:48)
whole like other people are getting (30:46 - 30:51)
things before you get things it's like (30:48 - 30:55)
it is so strangely disincentivizing to (30:51 - 30:58)
actually play the game and it's like I (30:55 - 30:59)
know that there are things that I (30:58 - 31:01)
greatly value an animal crossing' like (30:59 - 31:03)
getting all the songs and it's like when (31:01 - 31:04)
you find out well somebody else already (31:03 - 31:07)
got all the songs and you missed one (31:04 - 31:08)
week because you're out camping in the (31:07 - 31:10)
northern woods and now you have to wait (31:08 - 31:17)
a whole year until that song but pave (31:10 - 31:21)
furniture just to have a room full of (31:17 - 31:23)
pave furniture is worth the effort in (31:21 - 31:27)
the struggle we need to make real pave (31:23 - 31:29)
furniture in the real world and then you (31:27 - 31:31)
don't have to worry about it oh no too (31:29 - 31:34)
ugly to have an actual house not only (31:31 - 31:36)
good for virtual homes I don't know what (31:34 - 31:38)
pave furniture is we're gonna take a (31:36 - 31:44)
break though I'm a modern furniture kind (31:38 - 31:46)
of guy (31:44 - 31:49)
clean clean lines where are my surfaces (31:46 - 31:50)
that's right (31:49 - 31:56)
all right we'll be right back and they (31:50 - 31:59)
also show a new Pokemon called I don't (31:56 - 32:00)
know how to pronounce this so you asked (31:59 - 32:03)
the correct me (32:00 - 32:03)
john-boy (32:03 - 32:05)
[Music] (32:05 - 32:08)
it seems like just like nog and L not (32:12 - 32:18)
[Music] (32:23 - 32:35)
gaana del (32:32 - 32:35)
I can die second dogs 9 to 5 toys were (32:36 - 32:48)
cannot so what are the toys doing after (32:44 - 32:50)
5 p.m. (32:48 - 32:53)
look I didn't name their time I even (32:50 - 32:55)
name the website I've seen Toy Story (32:53 - 32:57)
though so I would imagine the toys get (32:55 - 33:01)
up they walk around the Hangout this is (32:57 - 33:06)
from James in our addict Channel Funko (33:01 - 33:13)
pop unveils for count'em for new Pokemon (33:06 - 33:17)
figures are you excited will are you (33:13 - 33:18)
gonna fall ready for the next news (33:17 - 33:22)
article pop your house you know these (33:18 - 33:24)
four figures or this is breaking news (33:22 - 33:27)
for you it's breaking news for me but (33:24 - 33:30)
because I just completely do not (33:27 - 33:34)
understand the point of Funko pops right (33:30 - 33:38)
like I understand action figures and (33:34 - 33:40)
like transformers which I used to love (33:38 - 33:42)
to have when I was younger be the robot (33:40 - 33:45)
close guys yes and they I could set them (33:42 - 33:47)
up and I'm like oh we're having a battle (33:45 - 33:49)
or I could transform them and it's like (33:47 - 33:51)
you're an airplane now or you're a (33:49 - 33:54)
cassette recorder Funko pops just sit (33:51 - 33:57)
there and stare at you you don't get to (33:54 - 33:58)
play with them and they're like plushies (33:57 - 34:01)
they also just sit there they don't (33:58 - 34:04)
transform I play that you notice I also (34:01 - 34:07)
don't have a lot of stuffed animals but (34:04 - 34:09)
but also stuffed animals you can hug or (34:07 - 34:11)
you can put on your well-made bed and (34:09 - 34:12)
you know amongst the pillows as (34:11 - 34:15)
decoration but just a Funko and the (34:12 - 34:16)
other thing that's horrible about Funko (34:15 - 34:19)
pops is it's like if you take them out (34:16 - 34:21)
of the box you've done it wrong yeah (34:19 - 34:31)
like who wants okay just that depending (34:21 - 34:34)
on their level of design once you take (34:31 - 34:36)
them out of the box they may not be able (34:34 - 34:39)
to stay that's sure but but no it's but (34:36 - 34:41)
it's just like I don't I don't (34:39 - 34:44)
understand it's like if I want sculpture (34:41 - 34:46)
I'll go to Greece right I'm not buying (34:44 - 34:50)
mr. Franco's things I mean I have some (34:46 - 34:50)
fun (34:50 - 34:53)
I'm my java so I have a couple Funko's (34:50 - 34:56)
so I have a I have Pokemon Funko's that (34:53 - 34:59)
I've purchased myself as their Pokemon a (34:56 - 35:01)
lot of the non Pokemon Funko's I have (34:59 - 35:03)
were given as gifts which I would argue (35:01 - 35:06)
it a lot of Funko's are probably like (35:03 - 35:10)
the good gift right not in this house (35:06 - 35:12)
brother or sister needs to get other (35:10 - 35:15)
brother or sister gift and we're both 30 (35:12 - 35:16)
years old and we don't know what to get (35:15 - 35:18)
each other but I know my brother really (35:16 - 35:21)
likes Star Wars here's the Han Solo pop (35:18 - 35:24)
figure that I just saw at Target I know (35:21 - 35:27)
you like Star Wars hope you don't have (35:24 - 35:28)
this one you probably don't cuz there's (35:27 - 35:31)
probably 40 different Han Solo pops I'm (35:28 - 35:33)
assuming by package then your old (35:31 - 35:37)
brother just wanted cash probably true I (35:33 - 35:40)
was after after 30 pretty much people (35:37 - 35:44)
just want cash you have to give Funko (35:40 - 35:48)
Credit in in making probably a product (35:44 - 35:51)
with little to no with with high (35:48 - 35:56)
probability you tilla t high profit but (35:51 - 35:59)
they sell it at such a good price that (35:56 - 36:02)
it's that's it's it's hitting that (35:59 - 36:04)
impulse zone for a lot of people what do (36:02 - 36:06)
these things go for they're usually like (36:04 - 36:09)
eleven dollars usually $10.99 to like (36:06 - 36:12)
$12.99 so they're like cheap at impulse (36:09 - 36:14)
price level you are correct they're (36:12 - 36:16)
cheap enough to be like oh man I love (36:14 - 36:19)
the Golden Girls and they have my (36:16 - 36:22)
favorite one Hillary I'm gonna buy that (36:19 - 36:29)
I mean we're not allowed to talk about (36:22 - 36:32)
this but I will say that we do have all (36:29 - 36:34)
four Golden Girls Funko pops and Hillary (36:32 - 36:37)
is not one of them so we're gonna move (36:34 - 36:39)
on I know Betty White is a golden girl (36:37 - 36:41)
bad enough her name is actually Betty (36:39 - 36:43)
White in the show it is no not oh it is (36:41 - 36:45)
not okay pick a different series Harry (36:43 - 36:50)
Potter Harry Potter I wanted pop fitting (36:45 - 36:52)
no one says Hagrid's their favorite pop (36:50 - 36:54)
figure somebody does if somebody likes (36:52 - 36:57)
spin does somebody likes Hagrid yeah (36:54 - 37:00)
maybe so I have speaking so I have all (36:57 - 37:03)
the day with Pikachu Funko pops which (37:00 - 37:04)
are made by (37:03 - 37:06)
funko but they're not pop figures (37:04 - 37:08)
they're the ones with like Pikachu being (37:06 - 37:11)
scared by the Diglett or Pikachu having (37:08 - 37:16)
a snowman they're like actually toys (37:11 - 37:16)
is it Funko just a front for game stop (37:17 - 37:23)
no I don't think that bones Funko I (37:20 - 37:24)
think of anything Funko probably has (37:23 - 37:26)
more money than games up probably some (37:24 - 37:29)
secret chairman rows cabal going on I (37:26 - 37:32)
mean they're Funko holdings LLC but that (37:29 - 37:34)
doesn't anything yeah I'm sure Disney (37:32 - 37:36)
will eventually buy them or something of (37:34 - 37:39)
the sort okay so the four new Funko's (37:36 - 37:44)
are Vulpix regular can Tony invokes mr. (37:39 - 37:50)
mime Pichu and mu to the Mewtwo and the (37:44 - 37:53)
mr. mime look okay I really like all (37:50 - 37:55)
four of these actually I think the Pichu (37:53 - 37:56)
looks really great too (37:55 - 37:59)
yeah sometimes sometimes these figures (37:56 - 38:01)
benefit from these eyes so they (37:59 - 38:03)
definitely don't I think the best (38:01 - 38:05)
looking Pokemon prior to these four was (38:03 - 38:07)
the Bulbasaur I think the mobile sort of (38:05 - 38:07)
looked really good (38:07 - 38:09)
Charmander did not look great though (38:07 - 38:14)
I've been told I have I know a couple (38:09 - 38:19)
very uh in in in very thorough Funko pop (38:14 - 38:22)
collectors they were probably I would (38:19 - 38:24)
imagine they're on the Funko forums (38:22 - 38:26)
they're hitting up the Funko reddit I (38:24 - 38:29)
probably have a Boram is a hundred (38:26 - 38:31)
percent I've never checked it but I'm (38:29 - 38:33)
gonna say yes oh there's a reddit for (38:31 - 38:35)
everything I'm sure they have a secret (38:33 - 38:38)
Funko Twitter where they do swap trades (38:35 - 38:41)
mystery gifting each other Funko's they (38:38 - 38:45)
told me though that in in the skews of (38:41 - 38:51)
unreleased Funko's there's a mu 2 GD (38:45 - 38:54)
Funko listed which is glow-in-the-dark (38:51 - 38:57)

incredible how one (39:16 - 39:20)
movie turned mr. mime into this (39:17 - 39:23)
marketing machine that clearly they (39:20 - 39:27)
people want mr. mime now I guess I mean (39:23 - 39:29)

right plane dates hey i double-checked (41:47 - 41:53)
greg double-checked for me i also (41:51 - 42:00)
learned that this airplane cast here I (41:53 - 42:00)
have learned from booking the wrong (42:00 - 42:05)
dates which I have okay I am sure (42:03 - 42:09)
somebody listening to this podcast has (42:05 - 42:11)
also booked wrong flights I'm sure more (42:09 - 42:14)
I'm so confident that I'm I could I (42:11 - 42:15)
could probably guess that two people (42:14 - 42:17)
have booked our flight so I'm not the (42:15 - 42:18)
only person in the world that has ever (42:17 - 42:22)
picked the wrong month but the right (42:18 - 42:31)
days yes but I've learned that even if (42:22 - 42:34)
you booked non-refundable tickets that (42:31 - 42:37)
you have 24 hours to still cancel oh (42:34 - 42:40)
yeah yes definitely and that that was a (42:37 - 42:44)
huge thing to me cuz even if I was like (42:40 - 42:47)
oh man no one's awake at 4:00 a.m. to (42:44 - 42:49)
double-check these dates or prices I (42:47 - 42:53)
could book it wake up at like 2 p.m. the (42:49 - 42:56)
next day and be like oh I still have 12 (42:53 - 42:59)
more hours before I need to verify that (42:56 - 43:01)
these are in fact the right dates so pro (42:59 - 43:03)
tip if you booked flight tickets you (43:01 - 43:06)
have 24 hours to cancel no matter what (43:03 - 43:09)
can I give a super life hack yes gonna (43:06 - 43:10)
save people money (43:09 - 43:13)
alright so let's say you booked a hotel (43:10 - 43:16)
and they basically say you have up until (43:13 - 43:19)
24 hours to cancel this reservation (43:16 - 43:21)
otherwise we're gonna charge you for the (43:19 - 43:22)
reservation right you've done that with (43:21 - 43:24)
the hotel before right yeah and then it (43:22 - 43:26)
gets to be within 24 hours and you find (43:24 - 43:28)
out like you're not gonna take that trip (43:26 - 43:31)
because I'm your flight got cancelled or (43:28 - 43:31)
something like that (43:31 - 43:34)
right the disaster you're gonna lose (43:31 - 43:37)
money right this is what you do this is (43:34 - 43:39)
the will anderson method you call the (43:37 - 43:40)
hotel (43:39 - 43:43)
and you say I have a reservation for (43:40 - 43:49)
tomorrow but my plans got changed and I (43:43 - 43:51)
need to move the reservation a week and (43:49 - 43:54)
they're like oh well fine well move your (43:51 - 43:56)
reservation you know no extra charge (43:54 - 43:58)
this like because you're not canceling (43:56 - 44:01)
your moving your reservation and then (43:58 - 44:03)
after they've confirmed the reservation (44:01 - 44:06)
has been moved a week be polite (44:03 - 44:08)
hang-up call back into customer service (44:06 - 44:10)
and say what my reservation is a week (44:08 - 44:12)
from now so I need to cancel it and then (44:10 - 44:22)
they don't charge the cleanest pool that (44:12 - 44:25)
is dirty dirty pool you are relying on (44:22 - 44:28)
people in customer service not reading (44:25 - 44:33)
the notes I mean if they took notes yeah (44:28 - 44:36)
dang this is this is my job this is why (44:33 - 44:39)

club account to ensure that champion (45:21 - 45:26)

first time I'm pretty sure they're (45:26 - 45:31)
giving actual points in an online (45:29 - 45:34)
competition my wrong I think they've (45:31 - 45:35)
done that before they've done that (45:34 - 45:37)
before Oh cuz the GTS could write (45:35 - 45:39)

this costs nothing to sign up you just (46:20 - 46:26)
go to the vs. you go to competitions you (46:23 - 46:29)
go to sign up you do not I think a lot (46:26 - 46:30)
of people don't sign up because they (46:29 - 46:32)
think they need a team ready you don't (46:30 - 46:33)
need a team ready (46:32 - 46:35)
you just enroll into the competition and (46:33 - 46:38)
then you can't even submit your team yet (46:35 - 46:41)
once the once the competition opens up (46:38 - 46:44)
on February 27th then it will ask you (46:41 - 46:47)
for your team so you can't sign up yet (46:44 - 46:49)
right it doesn't know it right start (46:47 - 46:51)

okay wet Wednesday February 19th until (48:12 - 48:20)
Thursday February 27th you launch your (48:15 - 48:22)
game you go to the verse menu select (48:20 - 48:24)
battle stadium you select online (48:22 - 48:26)
competitions and then you select search (48:24 - 48:29)
for online competition to register you (48:26 - 48:31)
can earn up top competitors can earn up (48:29 - 48:35)
to 50 championship points but you have (48:31 - 48:37)
to link your Nintendo account to your my (48:35 - 48:40)
trainer account in order to do so it is (48:37 - 48:43)
double battle format four to six Pokemon (48:40 - 48:45)
all Pokemon will be level 40 and 50 in (48:43 - 48:48)
battle you have 4 pokemon eligible (48:45 - 48:50)
pokemon or pokemon in the gallery x1 (48:48 - 48:55)
through 397 which is no za Shion no zama (48:50 - 48:58)
Zenta no Esther notice there are select (48:55 - 49:00)
Giganta max Pokemon you can use pretty (48:58 - 49:02)
much the Giganta max Pokemon that are (49:00 - 49:05)
legal outside of this competition which (49:02 - 49:07)
is Charizard Butterfree Pikachu Meowth (49:05 - 49:09)
Eevee Snorlax korbinite dreadnoughts and (49:07 - 49:11)
Akana and CentOS scorch only pokemon (49:09 - 49:14)
that are caught or hatched from eggs or (49:11 - 49:16)
received as mystery gifts and sword and (49:14 - 49:18)
shield are eligible and you are allowed (49:16 - 49:21)
15 battles a day 45 battles total I (49:18 - 49:24)
believe they do roll over um so if you (49:21 - 49:25)
missed the first two days you could do (49:24 - 49:27)
45 bottles on the last day but you're (49:25 - 49:29)
limited to 45 battles I believe because (49:27 - 49:32)
it's three days hmm speaking of the (49:29 - 49:36)
battle format they have so they they (49:32 - 49:39)
didn't allow any Giganta max Pokemon in (49:36 - 49:41)
season one and then in season two they (49:39 - 49:44)
allowed the ones I just listed here and (49:41 - 49:47)
I know Greg and I had an argument about (49:44 - 49:49)
how that was too fast in like allowing (49:47 - 49:52)
new Pokemon to be used season three (49:49 - 49:54)
they're not all season three started (49:52 - 49:58)
they did not allow any new Pokemon so (49:54 - 50:00)
there I guess taking another month so (49:58 - 50:02)
instead of adding more Giganta max (50:00 - 50:07)
Pokemon which was my argument back then (50:02 - 50:09)
Greg was just because they're adding (50:07 - 50:11)
expansion Pokemon doesn't mean they're (50:09 - 50:13)
gonna be legal for competition right (50:11 - 50:15)
away I don't know when what was promoted (50:13 - 50:16)
last time (50:15 - 50:20)
Oh flap al and Al creamy and oh yeah (50:16 - 50:22)
colossal and Lapras would I would (50:20 - 50:24)
imagine that those will probably be (50:22 - 50:26)
ready for season four which would be (50:24 - 50:30)
what March first I think sure I don't (50:26 - 50:33)
know or or not I don't I don't know I (50:30 - 50:35)
don't know if they I don't know what (50:33 - 50:37)
their their plan is competitive wise but (50:35 - 50:40)
I do like I do like these seasons I do (50:37 - 50:42)
like the season stuff I do like you know (50:40 - 50:44)
the thing resets every month which I (50:42 - 50:45)
mean a lot of games do a lot of games (50:44 - 50:47)
your stats reset every month and you (50:45 - 50:48)
climb the ladder and you do the things (50:47 - 50:52)
and it is what it is more Pokemon Day (50:48 - 50:56)
2020 you can vote for the most popular (50:52 - 50:59)
pokemon in each region and you can do it (50:56 - 51:01)
every day do it every day have been I (50:59 - 51:05)
haven't been but I'm not registered to (51:01 - 51:08)
vote so I need to get on that I think (51:05 - 51:10)
the deadline is February 11th to (51:08 - 51:12)
participate search for a Pokemon vote on (51:10 - 51:14)
Google but this is like a really weird (51:12 - 51:16)
way to do it but okay it's it's not (51:14 - 51:18)
great but yes they they're using (51:16 - 51:20)
Google's logo here in the press release (51:18 - 51:23)
so I'm assuming there's some sort of (51:20 - 51:25)
partnership the vote screen will be (51:23 - 51:27)
displayed on your search results select (51:25 - 51:29)
the category you want to vote from the (51:27 - 51:30)
eight choices select one pokemon from (51:29 - 51:32)
the list sorted by national dex number (51:30 - 51:34)
and click the vote button when you're (51:32 - 51:35)
signed in to the Google account you can (51:34 - 51:38)
cast one vote per category for maximum (51:35 - 51:41)
eight votes daily you can vote once in (51:38 - 51:43)
each category but you can vote each day (51:41 - 51:46)
during but you vote each day during the (51:43 - 51:48)
voting period votes will be counted (51:46 - 51:51)
based on the pokemons national dex even (51:48 - 51:52)
if the Pokemon has multiple forms (51:51 - 51:55)
including regional forums so for example (51:52 - 51:57)
if you wanted to cert if you wanted to (51:55 - 51:59)
vote for gallery' and Ponyta you just (51:57 - 52:02)
have to vote for Ponyta same from Vulpix (51:59 - 52:05)
I can we talk about the controversy (52:02 - 52:08)
around this capsule it's the controversy (52:05 - 52:10)
Melton is listed in the Galler (52:08 - 52:16)
list and not the a low-low list and it's (52:10 - 52:19)
listed as extra (52:16 - 52:22)
yeah so it's Kanto Johto ho and sin oh (52:19 - 52:25)
you know uh also do you guys get this on (52:22 - 52:27)
yours when it when it pulls up you Nova (52:25 - 52:29)
it says like you know the journalists (52:27 - 52:34)
you nema like is that actually you know (52:29 - 52:36)
like is it not you know in every (52:34 - 52:39)
language I'm assuming it must not (52:36 - 52:41)
because why else would they do that yeah (52:39 - 52:44)
I mean it yeah it did strike me as weird (52:41 - 52:47)
and I'm like what what okay cuz it's the (52:44 - 52:49)
only one that does that (52:47 - 52:54)
Kalos a Lola Galler etc let's go Pikachu (52:49 - 52:58)
let's go v is a Gen seven game in the (52:54 - 52:59)
sense that instantly it is different (52:58 - 53:02)
names in different language I guess it's (52:59 - 53:05)
using the gem seven wild in Jen Melton (53:02 - 53:07)
appeared in Pokemon let's go for Pokemon (53:05 - 53:10)
go first so there's another thing that (53:07 - 53:12)
happened there's a there's a video (53:10 - 53:15)
there's a video of like all the Pokemon (53:12 - 53:18)
they show each generation they show like (53:15 - 53:20)
Kalos they show Kanto in the order and (53:18 - 53:23)
stuff and then each when they like say (53:20 - 53:26)
Kanto it has all 151 Pokemon in it and (53:23 - 53:29)
then when they say Johto it has all 100 (53:26 - 53:31)
Pokemon on it and so they do that (53:29 - 53:33)
there's not an English video of it but (53:31 - 53:36)
it's on the Japanese Pokemon YouTube I (53:33 - 53:40)
think there's a Korean one too but it's (53:36 - 53:42)
it's just to get you hyped for Pokemon (53:40 - 53:46)
Day but in that video Melton and Mel (53:42 - 53:51)
metal are both listed among the gen8 (53:46 - 53:54)
Pokemon okay I I saw some discussion of (53:51 - 53:56)
this on Twitter and I immediately (53:54 - 53:58)
thought what does it matter (53:56 - 54:04)
you're right it doesn't matter so much (53:58 - 54:08)
but clearly do in the sense I guess it (54:04 - 54:09)
matters in the sense that like Game (54:08 - 54:13)
Freak and the Pokemon company know their (54:09 - 54:14)
Pokemon better than us (54:13 - 54:16)
ideally you would hope I guess you would (54:14 - 54:19)
think and I don't and I don't think some (54:16 - 54:21)
intern made this video or some intern (54:19 - 54:24)
worked on not saying all interns are (54:21 - 54:30)
incompetent yeah but I'm not like if you (54:24 - 54:32)
were to if you were to (54:30 - 54:35)
like look at the video like Mel Mel (54:32 - 54:38)
medal is behind like preser Kerr and (54:35 - 54:42)
hatena and and Grimm snarl and Melton is (54:38 - 54:43)
like right next to Bolton it's not like (54:42 - 54:46)
it's like these were placed in a way so (54:43 - 54:48)
everyone's face is showing so it's not (54:46 - 54:51)
like oh we don't know where Melton is (54:48 - 54:53)
going I guess we forgot to put it in the (54:51 - 54:55)
ole Ola let's try to squeeze them in (54:53 - 54:58)
together it's like no they somebody (54:55 - 55:00)
placed them here because that's where (54:58 - 55:02)
it's supposed to be my assumption for (55:00 - 55:05)
the etc is the only reason they have (55:02 - 55:06)
that is because somebody could argue (55:05 - 55:09)
well if Melton is gen8 why can't I get (55:06 - 55:11)
it in gen8 yet that would probably be (55:09 - 55:14)
the reason that they have the except for (55:11 - 55:16)
their I mean sure it's just it's weird (55:14 - 55:18)
that they did it that way (55:16 - 55:21)
just make another category because (55:18 - 55:23)
you're limiting that choice like it's (55:21 - 55:26)
Gellar and leftovers well the only (55:23 - 55:27)
leftover is melt mmm oh right yeah (55:26 - 55:29)
there's no other Pokemon sneaking into (55:27 - 55:33)
this trailer we have - coming - coming I (55:29 - 55:35)
count the calories Oh Cal Rex Oh (55:33 - 55:38)
shushing we he'll they're here they (55:35 - 55:40)
could have put them in there and they (55:38 - 55:42)
didn't and the arguments of like oh well (55:40 - 55:44)
it appeared in a gen 7 game so it has to (55:42 - 55:47)
be a gen 7 Pokemon like that's look (55:44 - 55:50)
munchlax was in those bad GameCube games (55:47 - 55:52)
before Diamond and Pearl came out (55:50 - 55:55)
Munchlax was also in Pokemon - before (55:52 - 55:56)
Diamond Pro came out (55:55 - 56:00)
Togepi was in the gen 1 anime before the (55:56 - 56:03)
gen 2 anime what was it Pichu was in the (56:00 - 56:05)
Pikachu short of the first Pokemon movie (56:03 - 56:08)
before they even got to a gen 2 Pokemon (56:05 - 56:11)
movie I mean they've just this is not a (56:08 - 56:12)
like a weird thing where they've (56:11 - 56:14)
introduced different generations of (56:12 - 56:19)
Pokemon the early besides all that I (56:14 - 56:21)
can't wait for everyone to be mad when (56:19 - 56:26)
Charizard wins Kanto oh absolutely if (56:21 - 56:27)
you're not voting Terra's art for Kanto (56:26 - 56:29)
you're not doing it right (56:27 - 56:31)
I was gonna go for oddish I mean I'm (56:29 - 56:34)
voting for Cuba but see this is a (56:31 - 56:35)
problem we have to work together we have (56:34 - 56:37)
to band together as a community and I'll (56:35 - 56:40)
vote for the same Pokemon otherwise (56:37 - 56:40)
farce (56:40 - 56:43)
otherwise you Charizard is going to win (56:40 - 56:46)
no we have to pick a Pokemon that at (56:43 - 56:48)
least has the likelihood to win Greg (56:46 - 56:51)
maybe it's not voting we can serves to (56:48 - 56:54)
win we can't vote third party here yes (56:51 - 56:57)
we got we have let me have a look (56:54 - 57:01)
suck it up and accept a joto is full of (56:57 - 57:04)
hot garbage except for Dunsparce and (57:01 - 57:08)
that's Naruto has qwilfish you know and (57:04 - 57:10)
it is the leader hot guard of the year (57:08 - 57:12)

Dunsparce now vote done sports boat (57:12 - 57:17)
Dunsparce boat den sports both done (57:15 - 57:19)
sports all right (57:17 - 57:23)
who's winning Hoenn Sableye (57:19 - 57:26)
ah yeah save lies gotta win Hoenn I feel (57:23 - 57:27)
like a bunch of legendaries they're (57:26 - 57:30)
gonna wait okay they absolutely are but (57:27 - 57:33)
but see I kids have a short attention (57:30 - 57:35)
span these days so it's up to us adults (57:33 - 57:37)
to vote every day cuz we can put we have (57:35 - 57:40)
tasks calendars we have phone reminders (57:37 - 57:42)
I wish it was only vote once because I (57:40 - 57:45)
am I like if you tell me I can vote (57:42 - 57:49)
every day I'm I'm out you've been voting (57:45 - 57:51)
every day done spark you've asked for (57:49 - 57:52)
too much first you think Piplup wins (57:51 - 57:56)
four okay you know people you people you (57:52 - 58:00)
people we're just telling me about every (57:56 - 58:03)
day is fine for animal crossing but you (58:00 - 58:05)
can't vote every day for the best Pope (58:03 - 58:07)
okay it's hard you know what every day (58:05 - 58:10)
because like you are on your computer (58:07 - 58:12)
more than you are an animal crossing (58:10 - 58:16)
okay I would it's because it's hard to (58:12 - 58:18)
vote for something that you know is (58:16 - 58:21)
going to lose but if you vote every day (58:18 - 58:24)
it's not gonna lose because you have the (58:21 - 58:27)
tenacity to make it happen look a 100 I (58:24 - 58:29)
know how democracy works it's all rigged (58:27 - 58:32)
no you don't you would to Milwaukee (58:29 - 58:35)
Public Schools you have the bare minimum (58:32 - 58:38)
your knowledge of democracy only goes as (58:35 - 58:40)
far as the Civil War it's very true yes (58:38 - 58:43)
a Abraham Lincoln in the Civil War is (58:40 - 58:45)
all you do that's all the bother to (58:43 - 58:48)
cover but those of us who vote every day (58:45 - 58:52)
well out do the 100 children who got (58:48 - 58:54)
access to mom and dad's Google account (58:52 - 58:59)
for two seconds to vote once we can turn (58:54 - 59:03)
the tide okay vote once vote often is my (58:59 - 59:04)
motto (59:03 - 59:06)
isn't it which way it shouldn't be vote (59:04 - 59:09)
once it should be vote vote vote daily (59:06 - 59:11)
vote often well vote once he's healing (59:09 - 59:13)
about once in each category yeah sure (59:11 - 59:15)
okay do it a lot so out of the gen8 (59:13 - 59:18)
pokemon what do you think is the one (59:15 - 59:20)
that could possibly win (59:18 - 59:23)
oh yeah / yeah I keep calling for Bolton (59:20 - 59:26)
but I think I would I would either argue (59:23 - 59:30)
that three P since I haven't seen a tree (59:26 - 59:32)
P and if I haven't seen a DP then (59:30 - 59:34)
probably most people haven't seen a tree (59:32 - 59:37)
P no I'm actually I actually do think 3p (59:34 - 59:40)
horses or Sonam have like the highest if (59:37 - 59:46)
it's a droopy do wondered race because (59:40 - 59:47)
people have been breeding that and (59:46 - 59:51)
sending out the rejects for months now I (59:47 - 59:53)
have so many droopy that I have throw it (59:51 - 59:55)
away from other people I have at least (59:53 - 59:57)
five different foreign 3 P if I ever (59:55 - 60:00)
wanna breed a shiny yeah I have a tree P (59:57 - 60:01)
coming out of my ears (60:00 - 60:04)
yeah 3 P is the one or trade pokémon I'm (60:01 - 60:06)
gonna say that score bunny has ash as a (60:04 - 60:08)
shot I think so too (60:06 - 60:10)
I definitely think Square money out of (60:08 - 60:12)
all the starters have a shot I wouldn't (60:10 - 60:14)
argue that should win but it won't how's (60:12 - 60:16)
the thing that's in race has a shot over (60:14 - 60:19)
all the other starters as well well it's (60:16 - 60:21)
the line right so the line is gonna win (60:19 - 60:23)
that's what their big thing is is if you (60:21 - 60:25)
vote for anything in the line that line (60:23 - 60:31)
wins mmm if all the like chain wallet (60:25 - 60:33)
where's come out and vote for tax (60:31 - 60:36)
tricity I could maybe see that it like (60:33 - 60:38)
you back in the day I get I gave that up (60:36 - 60:40)
I do think though that's Nam has (60:38 - 60:42)
probably one of the height as a shot (60:40 - 60:44)
avoid I do love Sam I'm torn between (60:42 - 60:46)
voting first now I'm and voting for (60:44 - 60:48)
Bolton but I made my choice I'm eight I (60:46 - 60:50)
went with my polka my masters pair I go (60:48 - 60:54)
Bolton you know it's not winning (60:50 - 60:57)
all of the art all of the fossils they (60:54 - 60:59)
have no shot yeah I don't think so (60:57 - 61:02)
speaking of Pokemon masters this is off (60:59 - 61:05)
silicon arrow Pokemon masters Professor (61:02 - 61:10)
Oak trailer teases his debut I'm gonna (61:05 - 61:13)
be full disclosure here I am a partner (61:10 - 61:18)
I'm partnered with DNA to help promote (61:13 - 61:21)
Pokemon masters I want to be very (61:18 - 61:24)
careful about an ounce Deana yeah I (61:21 - 61:26)
don't know there's an e in there though (61:24 - 61:29)
it should be Deana I'll add I'll ask (61:26 - 61:32)
them next time okay okay so I'm gonna (61:29 - 61:34)
cautiously dance around this because (61:32 - 61:36)
there's a lot of rumors out there and (61:34 - 61:40)
there are animal Greg can spec use (61:36 - 61:43)
anything Greg says does not reflect me (61:40 - 61:47)
of my partnership but I'll read it and (61:43 - 61:48)
then I'll so I'll shut up and then Greg (61:47 - 61:51)
can Greg can put their input of what (61:48 - 61:53)
they think the rumor is when February (61:51 - 61:55)
first began Pokemon masters oak (61:53 - 61:58)
appearance was teased now his upcoming (61:55 - 62:00)
role in the game has been confirmed with (61:58 - 62:03)
a trailer rather showing uh rather (62:00 - 62:05)
rather than showing the sync pair in (62:03 - 62:07)
game it's a live action video confirming (62:05 - 62:10)
Professor Oak is on the way so right now (62:07 - 62:12)
there's a Japanese video up I'm assuming (62:10 - 62:13)
that we're gonna get an American video (62:12 - 62:16)
probably by the time this episode goes (62:13 - 62:18)
up but if you haven't seen it it's on (62:16 - 62:21)
the official Japanese Pokemon a YouTube (62:18 - 62:24)
page which that I am allowed to talk (62:21 - 62:25)
about as long as it's officially on (62:24 - 62:28)
dnase twitter or an official Pokemon (62:25 - 62:32)
source that's fair game for me so the (62:28 - 62:35)
Pokemon masters oak sync pair is going (62:32 - 62:38)
to be a free one On February 14th (62:35 - 62:40)
they'll be doled out to users his (62:38 - 62:43)
partner is not confirmed we know about (62:40 - 62:46)
Professor Oak obviously I've watched the (62:43 - 62:49)
trailer multiple times there are rumors (62:46 - 62:51)
of what people think Professor Oak's (62:49 - 62:54)
pokémon is going to be this article here (62:51 - 62:55)
says again this is the article talking (62:54 - 62:57)
at me it could be Bulbasaur Charmander (62:55 - 62:59)
squirtle because technically they're not (62:57 - 63:02)
in the game yet but I will now pass it (62:59 - 63:05)
over to Greg and I'm washing my hands (63:02 - 63:08)
free of what Greg (63:05 - 63:11)
is rumors ah (63:08 - 63:11)
so I saw upon the reddit's because of (63:11 - 63:19)
Steve's influence I know unfortunately (63:17 - 63:21)
sometimes have to go to reddit that (63:19 - 63:26)
people are claiming that there is a (63:21 - 63:30)
shadow of a specific mythical Pokemon (63:26 - 63:36)
related to Mewtwo and they say the (63:30 - 63:39)
shadow is clearly there and I have (63:36 - 63:41)
stared at this photo (63:39 - 63:45)
oh geez for hours and I have no idea (63:41 - 63:47)
what they're talking about (63:45 - 63:51)
however that has not stopped everybody (63:47 - 63:54)
in the world saying they have seen Mew (63:51 - 63:58)
in the shadow and Professor Oak's (63:54 - 64:01)
partner will be mu I I don't know what (63:58 - 64:04)
they're seeing it sure it could be it I (64:01 - 64:07)
it could also be any of the surges (64:04 - 64:08)
except for Charizard because we know red (64:07 - 64:10)
is getting Charizard specifically (64:08 - 64:16)
probably Charizard X yeah I don't know I (64:10 - 64:16)
have gone back and looked and looked and (64:16 - 64:22)
looked I don't see it all of you are (64:19 - 64:26)
free to go stare at this picture as much (64:22 - 64:29)
as I have I have old eyes perhaps young (64:26 - 64:32)
eyes will see the shadow that I do not (64:29 - 64:38)
see but the big rumor right now is (64:32 - 64:40)
professor oak and mu because of this (64:38 - 64:44)
fuzzy shadow trailer is cool like Isaac (64:40 - 64:47)
Tyler is really really cool I was really (64:44 - 64:49)
really impressed with it yeah the (64:47 - 64:52)
trailer is very cool and I don't there's (64:49 - 64:55)
a lot in this trailer like there's a lot (64:52 - 64:57)
of things that point to a lot of things (64:55 - 65:02)
I don't they go past his they go past (64:57 - 65:04)
his table that has all the starters on (65:02 - 65:07)
it so it could just be that but like (65:04 - 65:09)
even in the trailer I'm staring I am (65:07 - 65:12)
staring at this pillar that's supposed (65:09 - 65:14)
to have the shadow on it (65:12 - 65:19)
don't see it don't I don't see it ah (65:14 - 65:23)
well either way uh this comes out in a (65:19 - 65:25)
couple days yeah it'll be here soon (65:23 - 65:28)
ah you know out of all sink Perry I'm (65:25 - 65:31)
still I'm still I've given DNA my (65:28 - 65:34)
feedback I said I want gen8 trainers in (65:31 - 65:39)
Jenny Pokemon but I am I never thought (65:34 - 65:41)
that they would actually do professor (65:39 - 65:43)
oak so the fact that just professor oak (65:41 - 65:44)
is coming I think is really exciting (65:43 - 65:46)
like I think that is a cool sink pair (65:44 - 65:48)
just in general that like oh cool (65:46 - 65:51)
finally in a Pokemon game we can have (65:48 - 65:52)
Professor Oak and they're going to have (65:51 - 65:56)
some sort of Pokemon that's cool and I'm (65:52 - 65:59)
sure he'll probably do like I'm sure (65:56 - 66:00)
there'll be the little voice sample (65:59 - 66:03)
thing which is my favorite mystery yeah (66:00 - 66:08)
the welcome Wow Wow good nice job job (66:03 - 66:11)
I mean Professor Oak already is in the (66:08 - 66:14)
game as Professor Oak strike persona (66:11 - 66:17)
agatha with Gengar so gasps this is this (66:14 - 66:19)
is his alternate form look at the (66:17 - 66:21)
pictures and tell me I'm wrong I'm (66:19 - 66:24)
predict is it the actual lore like they (66:21 - 66:26)
they were rivals like they went on a (66:24 - 66:28)
Pokemon journey together I'm pretty sure (66:26 - 66:30)
that's the actual lore of those two sure (66:28 - 66:33)
that's what they they knew each other (66:30 - 66:36)
but it's just obviously that is the (66:33 - 66:38)
classic Pokemon cut and paste right (66:36 - 66:40)
there it's just like that and paste the (66:38 - 66:42)
character model put a wig on it we're (66:40 - 66:42)
done (66:42 - 66:46)
it is it is cool that when they sent out (66:42 - 66:47)
that newsletter I don't know if you guys (66:46 - 66:51)
get the Pokemon newsletters oh I do oh I (66:47 - 66:52)
think oh I do (66:51 - 66:55)
we'll probably well are you I feel like (66:52 - 66:58)
wills the person that has like 800 (66:55 - 67:02)
unread emails I've got 26,000 done ready (66:58 - 67:03)
there we go that's what I thought when I (67:02 - 67:05)
get the Pokemon newsletter I do look at (67:03 - 67:07)
it and then delete it right quit II (67:05 - 67:09)
pretty rapidly okay perfect (67:07 - 67:11)
so that was sent on February 5th it (67:09 - 67:13)
starts off with the Google Year Pokemon (67:11 - 67:15)
and then it says Pokemon Day so they (67:13 - 67:17)
have they have sort and shield (67:15 - 67:20)
Pokemon go Pokemon Center and they (67:17 - 67:21)
actually have Pokemon masters so that's (67:20 - 67:23)
actually kind of cool to see whether or (67:21 - 67:25)
not you like Pokemon go or you like (67:23 - 67:26)
Pokemon masters or you like buying (67:25 - 67:29)
plushies from the Pokemon set (67:26 - 67:30)
this was a complaint that I've had a (67:29 - 67:32)
year after year that they don't do (67:30 - 67:34)
enough for these days especially because (67:32 - 67:36)
they do they have done stuff for Pokemon (67:34 - 67:39)
go but like last year they could have (67:36 - 67:41)
just gave us a distribution and let's go (67:39 - 67:43)
they could have just been like here is a (67:41 - 67:47)
here's a Machop that has a ribbon on it (67:43 - 67:50)
and they didn't even do that I don't (67:47 - 67:52)
know if we're getting a distribution for (67:50 - 67:54)
sword and shield specifically on that (67:52 - 67:57)
day they have they did recently give a (67:54 - 68:01)
20 battle point 20 battle point code at (67:57 - 68:04)
the start of season 3 which they've done (68:01 - 68:06)
every season of free 20 battle points (68:04 - 68:09)
they did as of when they released (68:06 - 68:11)
toxicity and GMAX raid they there's a (68:09 - 68:12)
code out there right now that gives you (68:11 - 68:15)
three TRS for host power horse power (68:12 - 68:17)
which is a ground type move toxicity is (68:15 - 68:20)
four times week to ground so stop using (68:17 - 68:22)
earthquake in raids because it hits (68:20 - 68:26)
everyone each you have three Pokemon to (68:22 - 68:30)
teach horse power the the the the big (68:26 - 68:33)
the big brain play here for toxicity is (68:30 - 68:36)
Toby tomorrow with lightning rod toga (68:33 - 68:39)
tomorrow is steel an electric can't get (68:36 - 68:40)
hurt by electric because the lightning (68:39 - 68:42)
rod can't get hurt by poison because (68:40 - 68:45)
it's steel type I teach it Zen headbutt (68:42 - 68:48)
which is super effective you're good to (68:45 - 68:48)
go (68:48 - 68:51)
toga tomorrow is the big big brain play (68:48 - 68:54)

whatever's good with for you i I think (68:54 - 68:59)
toga tomorrow is pretty cute so anyways (68:57 - 69:00)
going back to the email I think it's (68:59 - 69:02)
cool that it seems like they're focusing (69:00 - 69:06)
on multiple things here this year so so (69:02 - 69:12)

yeah the clone Pokemon just had like (73:08 - 73:12)
marks on them to show that they were (73:10 - 73:15)
clone so these program like camouflage (73:12 - 73:19)
yes yes somebody took like a black (73:15 - 73:21)
stripe and put it across their head and (73:19 - 73:23)
then they like lowered the opacity and (73:21 - 73:24)
the black stripe so it blended in with (73:23 - 73:27)
their skin not a particularly good clone (73:24 - 73:29)
what want me to mate the clones what do (73:27 - 73:33)
you want from him he was just born three (73:29 - 73:36)

now I want a party hat Gengar for my (74:30 - 74:35)
birthday and I believe according to (74:32 - 74:38)
Eurogamer when they talked to the antic (74:35 - 74:40)
knee antic did say that the party hat (74:38 - 74:43)
Pikachu uh sorry Pichu party how I think (74:40 - 74:45)
of all this but the party hat (74:43 - 74:48)
Charmander squirtle and Bulbasaur cannot (74:45 - 74:50)
evolve and the party hat Nidorino also (74:48 - 74:53)
cannot evolve and I do not think clone (74:50 - 74:56)
Pikachu can evolve but I don't remember (74:53 - 75:01)
that one for sure I get that people are (74:56 - 75:03)
tired of hats I understand (75:01 - 75:05)
I'm not tired of hatch I'd rather I have (75:03 - 75:08)
hatched in Chinese the big question is (75:05 - 75:11)
can these hat Pokemon be transferred (75:08 - 75:14)
outside of Pokemon go into Pokemon home (75:11 - 75:16)
when Pokemon home I can't even say when (75:14 - 75:18)
Pokemon home arrives because Pokemon go (75:16 - 75:20)
will not work with Pokemon home when it (75:18 - 75:23)
arrives I like hats because it's a (75:20 - 75:26)
another thing to collect so it gets me (75:23 - 75:28)
to go out I want the Pokemon with a hat (75:26 - 75:34)
I get it I am real tired of these 7k (75:28 - 75:38)
eggs they're doing its and like (75:34 - 75:40)
everything is restricted to eggs I feel (75:38 - 75:42)
like hey you want Wurmple with a party (75:40 - 75:43)
hat (75:42 - 75:46)
7k egg hey you want you want Bulbasaur (75:43 - 75:51)
Charmander squirtle 7 CAG you want any (75:46 - 75:55)
of this like it's a sin Oh event but you (75:51 - 75:57)
want the shiny riolu that we're putting (75:55 - 76:03)
out 7 keg you want RM Darumaka 7 keg I (75:57 - 76:06)
mean I hatched a 7k egg everyday so (76:03 - 76:10)
sometimes too though what's the what's (76:06 - 76:13)
the worry you want I'm in 10k eggs no I (76:10 - 76:15)
just don't want them in eggs (76:13 - 76:19)
[Laughter] (76:15 - 76:21)
do not have I mean to be fair I do not (76:19 - 76:24)
have a 7k egg every day but - like (76:21 - 76:28)
trivialize something as I would love to (76:24 - 76:30)
walk around and find a Bulbasaur and a (76:28 - 76:32)
Charmander and a squirtle and have one (76:30 - 76:34)
of each but then to say like oh you need (76:32 - 76:39)
to walk 7k which is a lot I feel like (76:34 - 76:42)
for a person to get the Bulbasaur of the (76:39 - 76:44)
charmer in the squirtle in a party hat (76:42 - 76:45)
which I will literally do nothing with (76:44 - 76:47)
except say I have a Charmander and I (76:45 - 76:48)
squirt it (76:47 - 76:50)
Charmander Bulbasaur squirtle in a party (76:48 - 76:52)
hat in my image or a funk ocean of the (76:50 - 76:54)
Pokemon world you're saying the photos (76:52 - 76:56)
of the Pokemon world but I have to leave (76:54 - 76:58)
that to random chance and what's going (76:56 - 77:01)
to happen is I'm gonna hatch like 414 (76:58 - 77:03)
Bulbasaur and not have two Charmander or (77:01 - 77:06)
squirtle and I will be pressured because (77:03 - 77:09)
the event ends into buying incubator so (77:06 - 77:10)
I can hatch eggs faster (77:09 - 77:13)
it's a Charmander it's just the mindset (77:10 - 77:15)
- of like okay I'm gonna go out there (77:13 - 77:19)
and hatch a 7k egg but what if I bought (77:15 - 77:21)
an incubator or a couple of incubators (77:19 - 77:25)
and i hatch v 7k eggs at once instead of (77:21 - 77:27)
walking 45 kilometers I only have to (77:25 - 77:29)
walk 7 kilometers and I get the results (77:27 - 77:32)
of five like I understand that this is (77:29 - 77:34)
their money-making tactic but that does (77:32 - 77:36)
it at this point I like it I don't even (77:34 - 77:39)
care what what is what is it all the (77:36 - 77:40)
server the party having to do for me (77:39 - 77:43)
literally another thing like I can trade (77:40 - 77:45)
it or I'll wait till the next party hat (77:43 - 77:47)
event where they put in the while and I (77:45 - 77:48)
put something else with a hat on yeah (77:47 - 77:51)
you're coming to my side yeah yeah there (77:48 - 77:52)
you go (77:51 - 77:55)
yes don't do the community you could (77:52 - 77:57)
maybe argue that like well they're (77:55 - 78:00)
giving you Eevee with a party hat that's (77:57 - 78:03)
in the wild yeah sure I guess but what (78:00 - 78:05)
if they just put more things in the wild (78:03 - 78:07)
then everybody would get them and they (78:05 - 78:10)
wouldn't make money yeah you're right (78:07 - 78:13)
they would make money there has to be a (78:10 - 78:15)
threshold of people who are like me who (78:13 - 78:17)
are very passionate about pokemon go who (78:15 - 78:19)
play a lot of Pokemon go who have no (78:17 - 78:21)
problem giving money to Pokemon go but (78:19 - 78:23)
at a certain point they're going to hit (78:21 - 78:27)
a threshold of these events are too many (78:23 - 78:31)
too often and super money grabby in the (78:27 - 78:32)
sense of you (78:31 - 78:35)
absolutely underestimate people's (78:32 - 78:39)
ability to wear their threshold is I (78:35 - 78:40)
mean I think you've already passed that (78:39 - 78:43)
right like have we allow right to this (78:40 - 78:47)
should I happen now now there are still (78:43 - 78:49)
plenty of people out there where Pokemon (78:47 - 78:51)
go is there one thing and they will pour (78:49 - 78:54)
that no I get that and I'm sure those (78:51 - 78:55)
people read the article and they're like (78:54 - 78:57)
oh man I can get a shiny squirtle in a (78:55 - 78:59)
party hat out of 7k egg you better (78:57 - 79:01)
believe I'm spending $40 on incubator (78:59 - 79:03)
I'm sure that person exists I'm sure (79:01 - 79:05)
they won't stop until they get all three (79:03 - 79:07)
and seven I'm sure they won't stop until (79:05 - 79:09)
they get them all I get it until they (79:07 - 79:12)
get them all with perfect IVs even the (79:09 - 79:16)
amount of people where you fall as very (79:12 - 79:19)
small I think that that I don't care (79:16 - 79:22)
about this anymore line separated a very (79:19 - 79:25)
long time ago oh oh yeah definitely (79:22 - 79:27)
there are the people where they are all (79:25 - 79:31)
in it's Pokemon go they set aside 10% of (79:27 - 79:32)
their income every month for Pokemon go (79:31 - 79:35)
and then there's people like me and Greg (79:32 - 79:37)
who are like well it's a community day (79:35 - 79:39)
and I'd like that you know uncooked (79:37 - 79:43)
cookie dough at the Mall of America and (79:39 - 79:46)
head down there I so I remember the time (79:43 - 79:51)
where they boy so I I specifically (79:46 - 79:55)
remember the Poochie it was it was what (79:51 - 79:57)
two years ago was the year of the dog (79:55 - 80:00)
cuz last year was a year the pig I think (79:57 - 80:02)
the year well I don't sorry I'm really (80:00 - 80:04)
bad thing I'd add they they really I (80:02 - 80:07)
mean shiny Poochyena and I remember that (80:04 - 80:09)
was kind of when they started doing a (80:07 - 80:11)
little bit more Chinese as specifically (80:09 - 80:13)
around these events so they would be (80:11 - 80:16)
like okay I think it was yeah cuz I (80:13 - 80:17)
think that was the time they did shiny (80:16 - 80:19)
party hat Pikachu and I was like oh I (80:17 - 80:21)
really want a shiny party hat Pikachu (80:19 - 80:22)
cuz I was like the first time they did (80:21 - 80:24)
it and I went out every single night (80:22 - 80:27)
with my friend Micah and we would we (80:24 - 80:29)
would go downtown and it was if it was (80:27 - 80:32)
nice out we would gather the car and (80:29 - 80:35)
walk but for the most part you know if (80:32 - 80:37)
it was cold we would just drive to the (80:35 - 80:38)
Pope would stop pull over stop spin (80:37 - 80:41)
check Pikachu okay drive to the next one (80:38 - 80:43)
and it was like 2 a.m. when we were (80:41 - 80:44)
doing this so there was like little to (80:43 - 80:46)
no traffic so it was really easy to park (80:44 - 80:50)
back up go again and that night I got (80:46 - 80:53)
after like four days of doing this every (80:50 - 80:55)
night I got to shiny hat party happy (80:53 - 80:56)
shoes and then when we went out for the (80:55 - 80:58)
Poochyena stuff I got the Poochyena and (80:56 - 81:00)
then I remember when they did another (80:58 - 81:01)
Pikachu and then I went out every night (81:00 - 81:03)
and I got it and then I think the last (81:01 - 81:04)
time I did that was the like the black (81:03 - 81:07)
hat Pikachu where it was in that special (81:04 - 81:09)
black hat and I was really excited and (81:07 - 81:11)
then they started doing him faster of (81:09 - 81:13)
like oh now we're rolling out shiny (81:11 - 81:15)
pokemon faster as content and then I (81:13 - 81:17)
think the one I missed but I did go out (81:15 - 81:19)
every night was like the shiny which hat (81:17 - 81:21)
Pikachu or whatever but that was like (81:19 - 81:23)
the point to me where I was like they're (81:21 - 81:25)
doing shiny they're like treating shine (81:23 - 81:27)
eases new content and they're layer (81:25 - 81:29)
layer they're doing one every week or (81:27 - 81:30)
one every other week because they need a (81:29 - 81:31)
reason for players to go out because (81:30 - 81:34)
there's nothing new to catch which is a (81:31 - 81:36)
big thing in Pokemon go right to catch (81:34 - 81:40)
Pokemon and I just can't keep up with (81:36 - 81:42)
this like it's not fun to go out every (81:40 - 81:45)
single night and check 400-plus Pokemon (81:42 - 81:49)
and then be relieved that like okay cool (81:45 - 81:51)
I got it on Wednesday night so I don't (81:49 - 81:52)
have to go out Thursday and Friday night (81:51 - 81:54)
like I and I get that's like a personal (81:52 - 81:57)
thing of like I need to go out but like (81:54 - 82:00)
I did in genuinely enjoy going out to (81:57 - 82:01)
collect things until it became (82:00 - 82:04)
overwhelming and now I feel like these (82:01 - 82:06)
party hats not only are they restricted (82:04 - 82:09)
with 7k egg stuff I feel like now that (82:06 - 82:11)
is to the point where it's overwhelming (82:09 - 82:12)
to like what I did with Chinese are like (82:11 - 82:14)
you know what I don't really care (82:12 - 82:14)
anymore (82:14 - 82:17)
it's there's so many Chinese available (82:14 - 82:19)
in the game that eventually I'll stumble (82:17 - 82:21)
upon them because I play a game enough (82:19 - 82:23)
and there's other games to get Chinese (82:21 - 82:24)
in like I don't need to go get another (82:23 - 82:26)
shiny poochy and I can just hunt for it (82:24 - 82:30)
and Omega Ruby alpha sapphire but these (82:26 - 82:34)
hats are ridiculous in the sense of in (82:30 - 82:36)
the sense of yes just let me get just (82:34 - 82:38)
like just let me find in the wild and (82:36 - 82:40)
catch it and be like okay I remember (82:38 - 82:43)
2020 pokémon day I went out I found a (82:40 - 82:45)
Charmander in a party hat I caught it (82:43 - 82:47)
I'm no one no one can no one else cares (82:45 - 82:50)
about this somebody's gonna hatch like (82:47 - 82:52)
eight of them I'm sure and be very salty (82:50 - 82:53)
that they didn't hatch the other one and (82:52 - 82:54)
they're gonna trade the other seven away (82:53 - 82:55)
and they're gonna have one of each (82:54 - 82:57)
they're not they're not competitive (82:55 - 82:58)
they're not really worth anything (82:57 - 83:00)
they'll come around the (82:58 - 83:03)
the next year I'm sure but the fact oh (83:00 - 83:07)
my god I'm just hit let's just let the (83:03 - 83:11)
egg stuff is infuriating I like I don't (83:07 - 83:12)
even care about the rate stuff because (83:11 - 83:14)
like if I spell like I can I can go out (83:12 - 83:17)
charizard blastoise Venus or I'll I'll (83:14 - 83:19)
spend a day looking for a Venus or I'll (83:17 - 83:20)
do that raid with Irene we'll both get a (83:19 - 83:24)
Venus or 4 for free go out the next day (83:20 - 83:26)
get the Charizard got the next K get the (83:24 - 83:29)
Blastoise like I do not mind dedicating (83:26 - 83:32)
20 to 30 minutes to be like let's find a (83:29 - 83:35)
Venus or raid let's do the Venus or raid (83:32 - 83:36)
heck I'll even spend the dollar if it's (83:35 - 83:38)
right there if a Charizard Venus or next (83:36 - 83:40)
to it heck let me just spend the dollar (83:38 - 83:42)
but I don't mind dedicating that 20 30 (83:40 - 83:44)
minutes to do it to tell me like hey (83:42 - 83:46)
Hach a 7k egg which probably takes I (83:44 - 83:48)
don't know how long does it take to walk (83:46 - 83:51)
7k like 45 minutes maybe 30 minutes if (83:48 - 83:52)
you're power walking (83:51 - 83:53)
I would probably mean I would probably (83:52 - 83:56)
say get one of those what are those (83:53 - 83:57)
things the two wheel things that people (83:56 - 84:00)
stand on hoverboards I know (83:57 - 84:03)
Segway guess egg way I can't tell that (84:00 - 84:05)
that's not walking I think as long as (84:03 - 84:08)
under 10 miles an hour yeah is it like (84:05 - 84:09)
just called a bike (84:08 - 84:11)
could you just get on a bike that's like (84:09 - 84:13)
way cheaper than a bikes will go faster (84:11 - 84:15)
than 10 miles an hour yeah (84:13 - 84:17)
well but they don't have to I mean if (84:15 - 84:20)
you don't pedal a lot well but yeah cuz (84:17 - 84:22)
I'm this genius of the Segway is you (84:20 - 84:26)
don't have to do anything yeah lean look (84:22 - 84:27)
if leading is hard for you you got (84:26 - 84:29)
bigger problems and hats on Pokemon okay (84:27 - 84:33)
but I'm using my free incubator I when I (84:29 - 84:35)
go to the mall I make it an effort to (84:33 - 84:37)
hatch a 5k egg which is probably (84:35 - 84:41)
anywhere between 30 to 45 minutes of (84:37 - 84:42)
walking maybe I'm I feel like I'm a (84:41 - 84:45)
relatively fast Walker I'm out you (84:42 - 84:46)
always walk in front of everybody you (84:45 - 84:48)
never wait for anybody right I got (84:46 - 84:52)
places to be well it's just frustrating (84:48 - 84:55)
it doesn't you want events to be fun and (84:52 - 84:58)
when I read all of this nothing about (84:55 - 85:00)
this sounds fun it's only frustrating (84:58 - 85:03)
because you care I do care because I (85:00 - 85:06)
want I want to go out and have fun I (85:03 - 85:10)
don't want to be like oh man Wurmple (85:06 - 85:11)
ends in two days and I don't have a (85:10 - 85:13)
Wurmple yet should I just this incubator (85:11 - 85:15)
box is only four dollars but that's (85:13 - 85:17)
exactly what they want you to think have (85:15 - 85:22)
you tried bowling possibly darts bowling (85:17 - 85:23)
is a great way to go out and have fun (85:22 - 85:24)
with your friends Greg let's go bowling (85:23 - 85:27)
sometime thanks oh yeah (85:24 - 85:27)
question of the week now's when we ask (85:28 - 85:35)
it the question of the week from the (85:31 - 85:39)
attic channel in slack that is the (85:35 - 85:42)
second Muppets reference I have listened (85:39 - 85:45)
to you in the past two days what is (85:42 - 85:47)
going on with the universe right now uh (85:45 - 85:50)
Muppets are back maybe (85:47 - 85:53)
Muppets never went away friend I'm (85:50 - 85:54)
pulling a question from last week (85:53 - 85:56)
because we had good questions last week (85:54 - 85:58)
this is from Casey and our attic channel (85:56 - 86:01)
with drag Algy I lost I don't know how (85:58 - 86:03)
to say that I'm sorry drag al Lia (86:01 - 86:06)
dragged alia lost regalia drag all yeah (86:03 - 86:10)
Martin called like bank-account lost I (86:06 - 86:13)
spent ten dollars doing a cross over (86:10 - 86:16)
event with Monster Hunter do you think (86:13 - 86:18)
that Pokemon decorators could do a (86:16 - 86:20)
crossover event like this or does (86:18 - 86:21)
Pokemon doing crossovers with other (86:20 - 86:25)
games like dragon Quilla drag al Lia los (86:21 - 86:28)
dragalge dragon (86:25 - 86:30)
the bad pokemon that's not winning (86:28 - 86:33)
pokémon 25 that is not a bad pokemon is (86:30 - 86:36)
getting all my votes now the reason that (86:33 - 86:38)
regalia loss can do it is because they (86:36 - 86:43)
have their own universe and like you can (86:38 - 86:46)
like you can pull in other monsters and (86:43 - 86:48)
to say hey these monsters are dragons (86:46 - 86:51)
and you can bond with them which is what (86:48 - 86:52)
the Monster Hunter thing is and it's (86:51 - 86:53)
been super fun (86:52 - 86:56)
I think Pokemon has up like especially (86:53 - 86:58)
like masters since it's so focused on (86:56 - 87:01)
specific sync pairs that you can't (86:58 - 87:04)
really pull like just like they could (87:01 - 87:06)
maybe deal with Tim Tim because Tim Tim (87:04 - 87:11)
has the same system there's not a lot (87:06 - 87:15)
that that matches up like masters is (87:11 - 87:17)
specific that this is this person and (87:15 - 87:19)
this is their Pokemon and that doesn't (87:17 - 87:22)
exist now Pokemon could branch out to (87:19 - 87:25)
other like I would luck drug alia lost (87:22 - 87:26)
and Pokemon crossover would be great (87:25 - 87:29)
because you could do that and like it (87:26 - 87:30)
wouldn't affect the regalia lost (87:29 - 87:32)
universe had all but I don't think (87:30 - 87:36)
there's an IP out there that could go (87:32 - 87:40)
into the Pokemon universe that fits that (87:36 - 87:43)
universe has Pokemon ever done any (87:40 - 87:46)
crossovers they've crossed over games (87:43 - 87:50)
beta styles like conquest yeah it's kind (87:46 - 87:52)
of like yeah that's not a crossover (87:50 - 87:53)
though yeah but like it was in the (87:52 - 87:56)
Pokemon universe with Pokemon and not in (87:53 - 88:00)
like what the regular game is to forget (87:56 - 88:02)
what kind questions I feel like the (88:00 - 88:05)
closest thing that masters could do is (88:02 - 88:11)
is like taking a character that like (88:05 - 88:14)
they could do Ashton greninja (88:11 - 88:18)
yeah which would probably be a little (88:14 - 88:20)
bit more outside what they've been doing (88:18 - 88:23)
with main series game characters they (88:20 - 88:25)
could do Martin and Solrock if they (88:23 - 88:28)
really wanted to which I think would be (88:25 - 88:29)
cute and I think fans would appreciate (88:28 - 88:32)
that but they're still pulling from (88:29 - 88:35)
Pokemon Pro right yeah that like there's (88:32 - 88:40)
no like we just left the Megaman (88:35 - 88:43)
event where we all got Megaman intergal (88:40 - 88:44)
a lost because the universe there is (88:43 - 88:47)
wild but like you couldn't do (88:44 - 88:49)
here's Megaman and his pokémon partner (88:47 - 88:53)
rush like it doesn't work ha that mega (88:49 - 88:55)
it's not that the derp Galya lost (88:53 - 88:56)
universe is wild is that sue golly a (88:55 - 89:01)
lost has a agreement with Capcom true (88:56 - 89:04)
they do but like it works in that (89:01 - 89:06)
universe right like they've created a (89:04 - 89:09)
universe that allows for it make it like (89:06 - 89:14)
it's not so tightly encapsulated um are (89:09 - 89:16)
the things that I would like deceit like (89:14 - 89:18)
yeah I would like to see masters branch (89:16 - 89:22)
out and bring other wild games in like (89:18 - 89:25)
there's a lot of games exists out there (89:22 - 89:27)
where you have an animal partner that (89:25 - 89:29)
could come in I think it would just feel (89:27 - 89:33)
incredibly strange given how tight they (89:29 - 89:35)
are with it you know I wouldn't I (89:33 - 89:37)
wouldn't need Matt I wouldn't need other (89:35 - 89:39)
stuff in masters but I would like to see (89:37 - 89:41)
pokémon stuff in other games like I (89:39 - 89:42)
think the yokai watch event in Final (89:41 - 89:47)
Fantasy it was super fun and it was cool (89:42 - 89:50)
as like I don't even I didn't like yokai (89:47 - 89:52)
watch and even after playing you okay (89:50 - 89:54)
watch it didn't really like it but it (89:52 - 89:56)
was cool to get like little yokai to (89:54 - 89:59)
follow you in Final Fantasy or to get (89:56 - 90:01)
monster hunter things to follow you in (89:59 - 90:04)
Final Fantasy because as a final fantasy (90:01 - 90:07)
fan hey guess what I also like other (90:04 - 90:09)
games and I'm able to kind of sport and (90:07 - 90:12)
show that off in in that world which is (90:09 - 90:17)
cool nintendo badge arcade that was a (90:12 - 90:19)
crossover there you go they could the (90:17 - 90:22)
rabbit could come back and then the (90:19 - 90:27)
rabbit could have a crane sync pair yes (90:22 - 90:31)
so look the only people that like the (90:27 - 90:33)
3ds now are people who can't afford the (90:31 - 90:36)
switch they need to excuse me I love my (90:33 - 90:39)

much drama I'll do calculus look some of (91:20 - 91:26)
us are trying to figure out things in (91:23 - 91:29)
the game I can't even stir the pot I (91:26 - 91:31)
can't even and the flame Fanning I (91:29 - 91:32)
thought you were supposed to phantom (91:31 - 91:34)
slows he didn't actually put the fire (91:32 - 91:36)
out and you're supposed to phantom fast (91:34 - 91:38)
well you're supposed to fan it fast so (91:36 - 91:40)
it gets big and then you fan it slow cuz (91:38 - 91:42)
you don't want it to get bigger so it (91:40 - 91:44)
burns (91:42 - 91:44)
once again as a real-life chef will I (91:45 - 91:54)

Pokemon of the week well your clues from (92:55 - 93:01)
last week I referenced the podcast Dewey (92:58 - 93:05)
dudes I talked about applying (93:01 - 93:07)
moisturizers so that you can create a (93:05 - 93:10)
protective bubble around your face and (93:07 - 93:13)
whether you should use SPF in your (93:10 - 93:15)
moisturizer because it has the damage of (93:13 - 93:20)
exposure to the fiery Sun and doubles (93:15 - 93:23)
moisturizing effectiveness for your for (93:20 - 93:25)
your skin and I also reference that (93:23 - 93:28)
there may be an alternative to Botox (93:25 - 93:30)
that is being developed from spider (93:28 - 93:33)
venom and that you should really start (93:30 - 93:35)
with an intensive skin care routine at (93:33 - 93:39)
least before you turn to age 22 (93:35 - 93:43)

podcast episodes up on YouTube every (97:25 - 97:31)
Monday so if you've made it to the end (97:29 - 97:33)
of this you probably weren't listening (97:31 - 97:34)
and maybe you were listening I need to I (97:33 - 97:37)
don't know but it's just another way for (97:34 - 97:39)
whatever reason if you have a friend who (97:37 - 97:41)
like has never listened to podcasts and (97:39 - 97:43)
it's just easier to share the youtube (97:41 - 97:46)
link there's there you go (97:43 - 97:49)
I've this is this is a real this is a (97:46 - 97:50)
huge (97:49 - 97:53)
I don't know discovery I guess that (97:50 - 97:56)
getting somebody to download a you tot (97:53 - 97:58)
cast app and then subscribe to a podcast (97:56 - 98:02)
there's a lot of work and maybe the (97:58 - 98:05)
YouTube is easy for those new people and (98:02 - 98:06)
then maybe once they like the show and (98:05 - 98:08)
they realize that they want to continue (98:06 - 98:10)
listening then they get the podcast app (98:08 - 98:11)
it's like a stepping stone it's like (98:10 - 98:14)
it's like we're putting training wheels (98:11 - 98:19)
on the show for people who might not (98:14 - 98:22)
just you know know what a podcast is I (98:19 - 98:25)
mean they're out there episodes have (98:22 - 98:27)
been going up on YouTube if that's you (98:25 - 98:29)

at YouTube at work and you get it use (98:29 - 98:34)
YouTube other YouTube content is going (98:31 - 98:36)
up so I stream pretty much every night (98:34 - 98:39)
on Twitch for like six hours that's a (98:36 - 98:42)
lot of content not sometimes nothing (98:39 - 98:45)
exciting happens in those six hours or (98:42 - 98:46)
it's hard to find the exciting part (98:45 - 98:49)
that's on how many eggs I'm hatching but (98:46 - 98:51)
every Wednesday and every Friday on (98:49 - 98:54)

for YouTube which is awesome so and (98:58 - 99:04)
they're cut they're cut and edited and (99:02 - 99:06)
they're a little bit more produced than (99:04 - 99:08)
just taking ten minutes and plopping it (99:06 - 99:09)
on YouTube so I think they're worth (99:08 - 99:11)
watching I think they're funny I think (99:09 - 99:13)
if you're if you're needing some other (99:11 - 99:16)
