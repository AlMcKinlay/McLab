saying that it's an unoriginal story it (2:02 - 2:09)

is Hamlet and it is no way shape or form (2:09 - 2:14)

[Applause] (2:26 - 2:31)
we got a show today we got a lot of (2:29 - 2:34)
Pokemon Go news yeah we got some movie (2:31 - 2:36)
news Food Network made some Pokemon (2:34 - 2:43)
cakes a heck of a show which program did (2:36 - 2:45)
they make the Pokemon cakes on just to (2:43 - 2:49)
warn me Oh which one was it there's one (2:45 - 2:51)
of the cake challenges wasn't it as long (2:49 - 2:53)
as it wasn't like America's worst chefs (2:51 - 2:55)
or something like that where they like (2:53 - 2:58)
just do horrible things to ingredient (2:55 - 3:00)
who would network challenge I think is (2:58 - 3:02)
whoa that's a good show though I like it (3:00 - 3:04)
I've never seen it so I guess I'll have (3:02 - 3:06)
commentary you want to poke my goodies (3:04 - 3:11)
all the way yeah Pokemon go I can't tell (3:06 - 3:14)
if those sarcasm or not all right (3:11 - 3:18)
is it coming from will yes it is excuse (3:14 - 3:22)
me I am the pure-hearted honest young (3:18 - 3:24)
man oh all right (3:22 - 3:26)
the amount of lie is starting with a (3:24 - 3:32)
young sent in from James from our slack (3:26 - 3:35)
community this is off of the verge (3:32 - 3:39)
Pokemon goes live events drove nearly (3:35 - 3:43)
250 million dollars in tourism revenue (3:39 - 3:46)
last year the antics says it's a our (3:43 - 3:50)
games are a boon for host cities of live (3:46 - 3:52)
events the real question is does my (3:50 - 3:54)
antic do what the Olympic does and leave (3:52 - 3:57)
the city in shambles on hit leave (3:54 - 4:00)
absolutely does is that what happens (3:57 - 4:03)
with the Olympics yes oh yeah oh dear in (4:00 - 4:05)
shambles so off the verge here in Natick (4:03 - 4:08)
labs says it's a live events for (4:05 - 4:10)
augmented reality are a hit with Pokemon (4:08 - 4:13)
go contributing 247 million dollars in (4:10 - 4:16)
tourism across three cities last year (4:13 - 4:18)
the announcement on Wednesday paired (4:16 - 4:20)
with the schedule for 2020 events (4:18 - 4:22)
including Pokemon go ingress prime and (4:20 - 4:25)
Harry Potter wizards unite Harry Potter (4:22 - 4:27)
Wizards unite still a game hey you guys (4:25 - 4:31)
were playing it for a bit yeah Natick (4:27 - 4:34)
says its biggest revenue generator was (4:31 - 4:36)
last year's Pokemon go fest in Chicago (4:34 - 4:38)
which drove a hundred and twenty million (4:36 - 4:40)
dollars in tourism (4:38 - 4:43)
spencer's from attending players across (4:40 - 4:47)
64,000 attendees across attending the (4:43 - 4:49)
four-day event annie antic has greatly (4:47 - 4:51)
improved the live event infrastructure (4:49 - 4:53)
in the year since and its events now (4:51 - 4:55)
largely go off without any issues (4:53 - 4:58)
another pokemon go fest was the one in (4:55 - 5:00)
the German city of Dortmund which drew (4:58 - 5:03)
more players there was 86 thousand (5:00 - 5:05)
attendees at Dortmund but it only (5:03 - 5:09)
generated six only sixty million dollars (5:05 - 5:12)
in tourism revenue how did they (5:09 - 5:15)
calculate I just how do you know that (5:12 - 5:16)
one dollar would that was spent was (5:15 - 5:18)
tourism revenue versus somebody else who (5:16 - 5:21)
came in for like a business meeting that (5:18 - 5:23)
would probably be up to the city right (5:21 - 5:25)
cuz the city the cities all the cities (5:23 - 5:27)
are normally always looking for events (5:25 - 5:30)
and then oh I would assume that Chicago (5:27 - 5:33)
knows because it rents out those parks (5:30 - 5:35)
and then they can set the price to bid (5:33 - 5:38)
for those parks based on yeah but (5:35 - 5:40)
tourism revenue means like all the money (5:38 - 5:42)
that the tourists spend in the (5:40 - 5:45)
restaurants and everything like that not (5:42 - 5:47)
necessarily the the renting of the park (5:45 - 5:49)
it's like what money are they making off (5:47 - 5:51)
of tourists coming to their city right (5:49 - 5:53)
right but like Jeb Cod knows that too (5:51 - 5:55)
cuz like didn't jetan can say if oh yeah (5:53 - 5:59)
he knows it because Indianapolis is like (5:55 - 6:01)
boy we were making zero dollars for the (5:59 - 6:02)
month of August and all of a sudden (6:01 - 6:04)
we're making like five dollars because (6:02 - 6:07)
that must be Gen Con imagining that they (6:04 - 6:12)
have a baseline of normal tourism and (6:07 - 6:15)
factor what has gone above and beyond (6:12 - 6:18)
that for that time period like the (6:15 - 6:20)
middle of summer is not a huge business (6:18 - 6:24)
trip or Chicago Tourism time well (6:20 - 6:26)
there's no such thing as Chicago tourism (6:24 - 6:27)
so that's it right there isn't it why (6:26 - 6:32)
would anybody people make different life (6:27 - 6:36)
choices well speaking of events this is (6:32 - 6:40)
a Pokemon go live.com January 22nd (6:36 - 6:44)
trainers the year of 2009 featured an (6:40 - 6:46)
incredible lineup events for Pokemon go (6:44 - 6:48)
from welcoming trainers to three Pokemon (6:46 - 6:51)
go fests across three different (6:48 - 6:53)
continents to hosting our first ever (6:51 - 6:54)
Safari Zone in (6:53 - 6:58)
they'll Singapore in Canada every year (6:54 - 7:01)
we aim to go bigger and better than last (6:58 - 7:05)
year in 2020 you can look for two more (7:01 - 7:07)
ways we will capture your wallets in (7:05 - 7:10)
more locations I made up the wallet part (7:07 - 7:12)
we are pleased to announce our (7:10 - 7:14)
first-ever events this year (7:12 - 7:19)
number one the tois the Taiwan a lantern (7:14 - 7:23)
festival in Taichung City number two st. (7:19 - 7:28)
Louis Missouri safari zone number three (7:23 - 7:31)
Liverpool UK Safari Zone and number four (7:28 - 7:34)
Philadelphia Pennsylvania Safari Zone (7:31 - 7:37)
which i think is in May which is only (7:34 - 7:38)
the first five months of the year so I (7:37 - 7:40)
would assume there will be more Safari (7:38 - 7:44)
zones at a later date so the non (7:40 - 7:47)
ticketed special citywide event of the (7:44 - 7:50)
Taiwan Lantern City festival will take (7:47 - 7:53)
place Thursday February 6 to Sunday (7:50 - 7:55)
February 9th that actually starts on you (7:53 - 7:57)
twos birthday here Pokemon will appear a (7:55 - 7:59)
bill a Pokemon appearing will include (7:57 - 8:01)
the electric-type pok√©mon mareep and (7:59 - 8:05)
Electrike Volpe - a bug type Pokemon (8:01 - 8:07)
known for illuminating the skies will be (8:05 - 8:08)
appearing throughout the city along with (8:07 - 8:11)
illumise a a bug type Pokemon that (8:08 - 8:13)
guides will be to draw patterns there's (8:11 - 8:17)
actually a cute scene with those two in (8:13 - 8:20)
detects Pikachu the game at the end (8:17 - 8:22)
where they're lighting up a festival (8:20 - 8:24)
illumise a is typically only available (8:22 - 8:27)
in North America South America and (8:24 - 8:29)
Africa so locals may want to catch it (8:27 - 8:31)
while they have a chance they can also (8:29 - 8:34)
catch unknown el to celebrate the light (8:31 - 8:37)
themed event and they can also enjoy the (8:34 - 8:40)
lovely sounds of Chimecho the wind chime (8:37 - 8:42)
Pokemon so not ticketed for that event (8:40 - 8:46)
starts actually relatively soon so I (8:42 - 8:47)
don't know if anyone's scrambling to (8:46 - 8:52)
grab tickets to taichung city but if you (8:47 - 8:55)
need something to do I guess there it is (8:52 - 8:58)
celebrating the culture of but this is (8:55 - 9:02)
wise mantak lying to us celebrating the (8:58 - 9:05)
culture of Missouri safaris on st. Louis (9:02 - 9:06)
I hmm (9:05 - 9:08)
maybe the culture of like cry (9:06 - 9:12)
why st. Louis was nice the last time we (9:08 - 9:15)
were there is not st. Louis right now (9:12 - 9:18)
number one-ranked for crime over I'm (9:15 - 9:19)
pretty sure it's even higher than (9:18 - 9:21)
Chicago at this point I don't pay (9:19 - 9:23)
attention to those things so I have no I (9:21 - 9:25)
have to look it up all right you look at (9:23 - 9:27)
me I'll tell you what you can expect in (9:25 - 9:31)

Villa del alright alright alright I hear (16:02 - 16:08)
you know Pokemon uh announced for that (16:05 - 16:11)
so yeah let's talk about this it's a lot (16:08 - 16:14)
nothing about Pokemon go fest I don't (16:11 - 16:17)
think they can walk away from Pokemon go (16:14 - 16:18)
fest because I think the branding around (16:17 - 16:21)
Pokemon go fest is very strong is (16:18 - 16:23)
they're contracting they're contractors (16:21 - 16:26)
chicago is done yeah I think they can (16:23 - 16:30)
walk away from it I think I think I (16:26 - 16:32)
think they got to do one more and then I (16:30 - 16:35)
they just commit to Safari zones but I (16:32 - 16:37)
think the safari zone brand (16:35 - 16:40)
internationally is is a lot stronger (16:37 - 16:42)
stronger than go fest cuz go fest was (16:40 - 16:46)
just us well angry I don't know our (16:42 - 16:46)
thinking they're not gonna walk away (16:46 - 16:48)
from Dortmund we don't know we don't (16:46 - 16:50)
know if that contract is up yeah but (16:48 - 16:52)
that was a safari zone no that was a (16:50 - 16:53)
girl fest there was three go PES last (16:52 - 16:56)
year one would be the only have go fest (16:53 - 17:00)
in Europe now maybe I just think their (16:56 - 17:03)
summers are too strong and they did go (17:00 - 17:06)
out of their way to say that Chicago (17:03 - 17:10)
made 120 million dollars in revenue I (17:06 - 17:12)
wouldn't be surprised if Chicago tries (17:10 - 17:14)
to get another one to two years out of (17:12 - 17:16)
them because I don't think they just (17:14 - 17:17)
walked away from that contract and said (17:16 - 17:18)
yeah we're good (17:17 - 17:21)
I'm sure Chicago was like do you want (17:18 - 17:24)
another year or two mean Chicago might (17:21 - 17:28)
but that doesn't mean that they want (17:24 - 17:31)
I mean Chicago's expensive yeah and like (17:28 - 17:33)
stringer was really expensive and I (17:31 - 17:36)
unless Chicago really gave them a super (17:33 - 17:40)
super super sweet deal I don't know that (17:36 - 17:42)
they're gonna want to say oh because of (17:40 - 17:46)
history we'll go back there like (17:42 - 17:48)
I don't I don't see a lot of with these (17:46 - 17:52)
uploaded upfront I think they will want (17:48 - 17:56)
to do more events around the u.s. in (17:52 - 17:59)
smaller venues that probably don't cost (17:56 - 18:03)
as much I think so too but here's a (17:59 - 18:05)
thing these events didn't send that a (18:03 - 18:09)
sellout go fest sells out that's that's (18:05 - 18:13)
actually the surprising thing to me is (18:09 - 18:16)
that you know tickets one on sale at (18:13 - 18:19)
8:00 and not like 11 o'clock you could (18:16 - 18:22)
still get tickets yeah but I think the (18:19 - 18:25)
bigger question is did the two locations (18:22 - 18:28)
sell more even though they didn't sell (18:25 - 18:32)
out then one Chicago oh I'm well I'm (18:28 - 18:34)
well the other tickets are on sale but (18:32 - 18:35)
I'm sure I mean this is what we said on (18:34 - 18:37)
the podcast before is like why keep (18:35 - 18:39)
doing one location when you could do (18:37 - 18:41)
multiple locations and make even more (18:39 - 18:43)
money and if you don't sell out then (18:41 - 18:46)
great I just don't think I just think (18:43 - 18:49)
that go Fest is look I'm not advocating (18:46 - 18:52)
for go fest I think this way is better I (18:49 - 18:55)
just think that they would do go fast as (18:52 - 18:58)
they like okay here is an all-day thing (18:55 - 19:01)
here is the thing that sells out this is (18:58 - 19:04)
like the the the Super Bowl the (19:01 - 19:07)
WrestleMania the Olympics of our year (19:04 - 19:11)
and we use this to kick off our our (19:07 - 19:13)
summer and their summer is always very (19:11 - 19:17)
very good like I suspect after summer in (19:13 - 19:20)
like September October they will have an (19:17 - 19:23)
event in like the Portland area or the (19:20 - 19:25)
Seattle area or the California area (19:23 - 19:29)
because that area seems to be forgotten (19:25 - 19:31)
about I mean they have one in the middle (19:29 - 19:33)
of the US st. Louis and they have one on (19:31 - 19:35)
the East Coast Pennsylvania man if they (19:33 - 19:39)
have one in Portland I'm in I'm going (19:35 - 19:40)
really (19:39 - 19:42)
I love Portland yeah oh absolutely that (19:40 - 19:43)
was on my list of cities I could have (19:42 - 19:49)
moved to Portland is beautiful it is (19:43 - 19:50)
I'm sure there will be another one in (19:49 - 19:52)
South America I'm sure Australia will (19:50 - 19:54)
get one I wouldn't be surprised if they (19:52 - 19:56)
try India Japan will obviously have (19:54 - 19:59)
something over Pikachu outbreak there's (19:56 - 20:00)
more than one place in Europe so I (19:59 - 20:04)
completely suspect them to do a lot more (20:00 - 20:07)
safari zones I'm just curious of like I (20:04 - 20:09)
feel like they have to do one more year (20:07 - 20:12)
of go fest just because like they didn't (20:09 - 20:14)
say they were done with it and it does (20:12 - 20:16)
really kick off their summer which is (20:14 - 20:18)
the most successful they've ever been is (20:16 - 20:20)
during the summer now I think though (20:18 - 20:23)
fest is dead that's my prediction I (20:20 - 20:26)
think go Fest has a mixed history so (20:23 - 20:28)
like people still report about the (20:26 - 20:32)
disastrous first go fest I would think (20:28 - 20:34)
that they'd be like you know what we're (20:32 - 20:36)
just gonna leave that behind like we did (20:34 - 20:39)
we did a good one we had a bad one let's (20:36 - 20:42)
just good ones one bad one I can (20:39 - 20:44)
definitely see maybe they go like hey (20:42 - 20:46)
instead of go fest we're doing two (20:44 - 20:49)
safari zones at the same time one in (20:46 - 20:52)
Chicago one in Houston I could see them (20:49 - 20:54)
doing that and these are a little bit (20:52 - 20:56)
more special because they're gonna kick (20:54 - 20:58)
off our summer how are they gonna (20:56 - 21:04)
distribute Shaymin or mythical Pokemon (20:58 - 21:07)
they distribute at these events speaking (21:04 - 21:10)
of changing things up the other thing (21:07 - 21:14)
they've announced here is Community Day (21:10 - 21:16)
make your voices heard (21:14 - 21:18)
trainers Community Day is a key piece of (21:16 - 21:20)
what makes Pokemon go a unique gaming (21:18 - 21:24)
experience it's an event that encourages (21:20 - 21:26)
all trainers to go out and play one day (21:24 - 21:30)
a month and we've ended multiple days a (21:26 - 21:32)
month you force us to play together (21:30 - 21:35)
Pokemon go and we venomously spend time (21:32 - 21:37)
with my friends how dare you we and (21:35 - 21:40)
mostly inspired that by impact it had on (21:37 - 21:42)
building local communities to allow (21:40 - 21:45)
community to live up to its name we were (21:42 - 21:47)
letting trainers everywhere vote on the (21:45 - 21:50)
next pokemon what uncle chewy sure you (21:47 - 21:53)
are I believe this voting is next (21:50 - 21:56)
weekend you will vote by collecting (21:53 - 21:58)
research tests and then completing the (21:56 - 22:00)
research tests if you don't want to vote (21:58 - 22:02)
for a specific Pokemon they (22:00 - 22:04)
to delete their task and find another (22:02 - 22:07)
task and they said that they will fairly (22:04 - 22:10)
spread out the tasks and whatnot so it's (22:07 - 22:12)
a limited number of candidates there's (22:10 - 22:15)
four I have all four here for you I (22:12 - 22:18)
thought I could vote for any Pokemon no (22:15 - 22:22)
I have four nine I have four for you (22:18 - 22:27)
the 2020 february community candidates (22:22 - 22:30)

dread teeny already did it yeah (22:53 - 23:00)
No all these are bad except yes the (22:56 - 23:03)
vocals I guess Vulpix wins yeah okay oh (23:00 - 23:07)
my god I just blinded that if any of (23:03 - 23:10)
these win I can probably skip community (23:07 - 23:17)
yeah although big news big changes at (23:10 - 23:18)
the Mall of America (23:17 - 23:23)
what so previously there was a rumor (23:18 - 23:25)
that they were going to start removing (23:23 - 23:27)
stops for Mall of America because Mall (23:25 - 23:29)
of America didn't want Pokemon go play (23:27 - 23:31)
brutal in there didn't want all of our (23:29 - 23:34)
business buying you know uncooked cookie (23:31 - 23:37)
dough and ice cream and exercise how the (23:34 - 23:38)
tables have turned (23:37 - 23:41)
for now that very Moll is encouraging (23:38 - 23:44)
people to come per community today and (23:41 - 23:45)
businesses are starting to offer (23:44 - 23:49)
Community Day specials well well well (23:45 - 23:51)
now the tables have turned so Mall of (23:49 - 23:54)
America can go by mall America go fest (23:51 - 23:58)
20 Tony 20 burning yeah it's indoors (23:54 - 24:00)
when you buy a ticket you're restricted (23:58 - 24:04)
to a floor third floor there's water (24:00 - 24:08)
pride on the needles right I don't want (24:04 - 24:11)
that no no no I want the spongebob (24:08 - 24:13)
rollercoaster or The Fairly OddParents (24:11 - 24:14)
rollercoaster (24:13 - 24:18)
neither you get TMT or nothing well yeah (24:14 - 24:20)
Bubble Guppies or nothing (24:18 - 24:22)
there's no Bubble Guppies Oh Bubble (24:20 - 24:25)
Guppies is there at the mole oven oh (24:22 - 24:29)
yeah where where it's like some ant I (24:25 - 24:33)
don't even know what a Bubble Guppies oh (24:29 - 24:36)
but there's a new fancy M&M store coming (24:33 - 24:38)
where the American Girl doll store used (24:36 - 24:40)
to be so we're gonna get all sorts of (24:38 - 24:43)
wild M&M flavors now it's very exciting (24:40 - 24:46)
there this is the the for Pokemon here (24:43 - 24:50)
are not randomly picked look nacho (24:46 - 24:52)
Niantic makes a lot of bad (24:50 - 24:55)
Asians we've already established that I (24:52 - 24:56)
would assume that a lot of their (24:55 - 25:00)
decisions are probably uh throttled by (24:56 - 25:01)
the Pokemon company because they have to (25:00 - 25:03)
get pretty much everything approved (25:01 - 25:04)
through the Pokemon company (25:03 - 25:06)
international but they didn't just (25:04 - 25:08)
randomly pick for Pokemon out of the (25:06 - 25:12)
available 500 Pokemon available like (25:08 - 25:14)
will said some of these Pokemon have (25:12 - 25:17)
existed before like dratini so I want to (25:14 - 25:19)
go through this and point out the logic (25:17 - 25:23)
here because at the end of this I think (25:19 - 25:25)
it I think Greg's right I don't think it (25:23 - 25:28)
matters who wins because they're all (25:25 - 25:29)
four of these were picked for a reason (25:28 - 25:31)
Yantic is going to do the Niantic thing (25:29 - 25:33)
which is going to be will see a press (25:31 - 25:36)
release in a week or a month that'll say (25:33 - 25:38)
trainers we're so proud that you went (25:36 - 25:41)
out there and give voted because of your (25:38 - 25:43)
because of your dedication we're gonna (25:41 - 25:45)
give you all four of these they're gonna (25:43 - 25:47)
do something like that cuz they always (25:45 - 25:50)
do cuz yeah me antic and researched (25:47 - 25:52)
things you don't you vote on don't (25:50 - 25:54)
actually matter cuz I'll never actually (25:52 - 25:56)
release the results it's already decided (25:54 - 25:58)
I'm not gonna go into their special (25:56 - 26:00)
moves or whatnot they all have special (25:58 - 26:01)
moves but let's start with ball picks (26:00 - 26:03)
alone when Vulpix is already available (26:01 - 26:07)
as a shiny but regular Vulpix is not so (26:03 - 26:09)
there's there's two reasons why ball (26:07 - 26:11)
picks is added to this list the number (26:09 - 26:13)
one reason is ball picks is a very (26:11 - 26:15)
popular pokemon it has a lot of (26:13 - 26:17)
merchandise in the pokemon center a (26:15 - 26:19)
little in Vulpix and full picks are (26:17 - 26:22)
quite a duo now but more importantly (26:19 - 26:25)
knee antic is using this pokemon to test (26:22 - 26:28)
if people are okay with a two-stage (26:25 - 26:31)
pokemon Vulpix into nine tails no third (26:28 - 26:32)
evolution ooh (26:31 - 26:34)
so that's why Vulpix is originally (26:32 - 26:36)
picked now you could say well Pikachu (26:34 - 26:37)
existed and that's true because peach (26:36 - 26:40)
well peaches use three but peaches (26:37 - 26:43)
locked in eggs you can do the default (26:40 - 26:44)
answer of Pikachu doesn't count because (26:43 - 26:46)
it was the first one and it's Pikachu (26:44 - 26:48)
very hard to compare any Pokemon - (26:46 - 26:51)
Pikachu okay so that's why Vulpix is on (26:48 - 26:54)
this list very popular they're testing (26:51 - 26:55)
to see if people are okay with not (26:54 - 26:58)
having a three-stage evolution I think (26:55 - 27:00)
the answer is obvious yes (26:58 - 27:02)
Vulpix is one of the people one of the (27:00 - 27:05)
pokemon that is very vocal on Reddit and (27:02 - 27:06)
Twitter of want (27:05 - 27:10)
to win number two is Machop the obvious (27:06 - 27:12)
Machop is one of the best fighting-type (27:10 - 27:14)
pok√©mon in the game but the reason (27:12 - 27:16)
Machop is on that list is one because of (27:14 - 27:18)
that but number two is because machop's (27:16 - 27:20)
shiney is already available so what this (27:18 - 27:22)
means is in the antic is testing to see (27:20 - 27:24)
if somebody if are the community is okay (27:22 - 27:28)
with a community day of a pokemon that (27:24 - 27:30)
is already available in the shiny this (27:28 - 27:33)
matters for a couple reasons one because (27:30 - 27:35)
eventually they're going to run out of (27:33 - 27:38)
shiny pokemon right like the drip (27:35 - 27:40)
through the drip feed of shiny pokemon (27:38 - 27:43)
is catching up with itself we're almost (27:40 - 27:46)
through Gen 5 I hate to break it to (27:43 - 27:51)
people gen 7 and Gen 6 7 & 8 have a very (27:46 - 27:53)
small pool of Pokemon compared to Gen 5 (27:51 - 27:57)
in the previous gen very true and we're (27:53 - 27:59)
getting we're getting near the end so (27:57 - 28:01)
Machop Machop SHINee has been available (27:59 - 28:03)
but this pokemon is on the list because (28:01 - 28:07)
it is the one of the best in gyms and (28:03 - 28:10)
raids and it's already shiny sony antic (28:07 - 28:12)
is testing that specifically if people (28:10 - 28:12)
are ok with that (28:12 - 28:14)
now ride horns on the list for the same (28:12 - 28:17)
reasons as Machop it's very good in (28:14 - 28:21)
raids and gyms but it's shiny is not (28:17 - 28:23)
available it is a three-stage evolution (28:21 - 28:26)
that requires a sin o stone we already (28:23 - 28:27)
know that people are ok with that they (28:26 - 28:29)
did but that with swine hub the swine (28:27 - 28:33)
hub and with Ralts but more importantly (28:29 - 28:36)
Rhyhorn is very readily available for (28:33 - 28:39)
anyone in a ground biome it's it's the (28:36 - 28:40)
Pokemon on the list that is not shiny (28:39 - 28:44)
but also doesn't come from a tent keg so (28:40 - 28:46)
the antic is testing that to see if (28:44 - 28:50)
people are ok with a pokemon that (28:46 - 28:53)
wouldn't be as rare you know prior to (28:50 - 28:55)
community days it was almost impossible (28:53 - 28:57)
to find a dirty knee it was almost (28:55 - 28:59)
impossible to find a role to rebelled (28:57 - 29:00)
them now they did kind of do that with (28:59 - 29:03)
swine hub but you could maybe argue that (29:00 - 29:04)
the reason swine up got featured is (29:03 - 29:06)
because it was the year the pig but this (29:04 - 29:09)
is why Rhyhorn is on the list and you (29:06 - 29:11)
could see them doing that with wheedle (29:09 - 29:13)
or spheal you know these Pokemon that (29:11 - 29:15)
are very common but we don't (29:13 - 29:17)
specifically have Chinese of yet and (29:15 - 29:19)
then the last one is the biggest (29:17 - 29:21)
tell of why this list is created again (29:19 - 29:23)
none of these four were specifically (29:21 - 29:24)
they weren't they just didn't throw them (29:23 - 29:26)
in a bucket and then puke them out and (29:24 - 29:27)
say well these are the four we got (29:26 - 29:29)
dratini is on the list to prove can they (29:27 - 29:32)
repeat another community can we take a (29:29 - 29:34)
Pokemon that we did almost two years ago (29:32 - 29:36)
and can we recycle it again dratini is (29:34 - 29:38)
extremely popular you don't really find (29:36 - 29:40)
in the wild if you hatch a lot of 10k (29:38 - 29:42)
eggs of course you're gonna get a lot of (29:40 - 29:43)
Shruti knees but that's not who (29:42 - 29:45)
community is targeting community is (29:43 - 29:47)
targeting people who will go out maybe (29:45 - 29:49)
spend four dollars and get everyone (29:47 - 29:51)
together the antek doesn't care about (29:49 - 29:53)
the people who get a million dirty knees (29:51 - 29:55)
or already caught a million dirty knees (29:53 - 29:58)
on Community Day because those people (29:55 - 30:00)
are going to spend money even if they (29:58 - 30:01)
whine and pout that they've had this (30:00 - 30:04)
community before it's very clear that (30:01 - 30:06)
that a lot of players (30:04 - 30:08)
we're not playing when dratini community (30:06 - 30:11)
came around so again at a certain point (30:08 - 30:12)
they're going to run out of shiny (30:11 - 30:16)
pokemon to add and they're going to have (30:12 - 30:20)
to recycle community days or recycle (30:16 - 30:23)
like with a Machop situation miss (30:20 - 30:25)
Pokemon is already shiny can we do a (30:23 - 30:27)
community day for it because they got to (30:25 - 30:30)
do 12 a year so that's why dratini is on (30:27 - 30:32)
the list did there any prove they can (30:30 - 30:34)
redo them with the last community day in (30:32 - 30:36)
December which was all of them yeah but (30:34 - 30:38)
those are always like nobody places (30:36 - 30:40)
because it's Christmas yeah no one plays (30:38 - 30:42)
it and the odds are the odds are not (30:40 - 30:43)
nearly as high on those days I think (30:42 - 30:45)
instead of mourning 25 years an (30:43 - 30:47)
extension variety or like 170 or (30:45 - 30:50)
something I I think all of these will (30:47 - 30:53)
eventually be community days this year I (30:50 - 30:56)
don't think Snivy is going to be March (30:53 - 31:00)
Jen 5 is not even six months old yet by (30:56 - 31:03)
the time we got the Jen for starters it (31:00 - 31:06)
was already 11 months in the game if (31:03 - 31:10)
they were to do Snivy in March and then (31:06 - 31:14)
Tepig in Tepig in May and then osawa in (31:10 - 31:17)
July then we're done with Jen five (31:14 - 31:19)
starters and Jen six starters wouldn't (31:17 - 31:21)
even be out yet for those that are like (31:19 - 31:23)
well the pattern of they always rotates (31:21 - 31:26)
burners the pattern would either end now (31:23 - 31:30)
of they they hold back on Snivy and they (31:26 - 31:31)
don't give it to you in March I mean (31:30 - 31:32)
it's possible (31:31 - 31:33)
they'd the (31:32 - 31:35)
they do snappy in March but it's going (31:33 - 31:38)
to end and Gen 6 won't be out yet and (31:35 - 31:39)
then what are they supposed to do at (31:38 - 31:41)
that point they're not gonna give you (31:39 - 31:45)
fennekin right away because they need to (31:41 - 31:47)
artificially make something rare for (31:45 - 31:50)
like six months and then give it to you (31:47 - 31:52)
after that right that's like what they (31:50 - 31:54)
live there there's an artificial rarity (31:52 - 31:56)
and go and after a year that Pokemon is (31:54 - 31:59)
no longer right here and they move on to (31:56 - 32:01)
the next one there's there's not a (31:59 - 32:02)
situation though going back to this (32:01 - 32:03)
community there's not a situation here (32:02 - 32:06)
where Vulpix wins and they go well I (32:03 - 32:07)
guess we'll never give Rhyhorn a (32:06 - 32:11)
community day never going to do that no (32:07 - 32:14)
but they will because we voted for it (32:11 - 32:17)
don't you understand if we all don't do (32:14 - 32:19)
those we have control over their release (32:17 - 32:23)
schedule it's direct feedback five head (32:19 - 32:25)
Machop evolve Machop intima champ using (32:23 - 32:27)
the exclusive move payback there's not (32:25 - 32:29)
going to be a situation ever where (32:27 - 32:30)
Machop doesn't get payback they've (32:29 - 32:32)
already pretty much guaranteed that (32:30 - 32:34)
whether it's this event or a future (32:32 - 32:37)
event they're gonna give Machop payback (32:34 - 32:39)
I like for me it doesn't matter what (32:37 - 32:40)
wins I wouldn't be surprised if (32:39 - 32:42)
continued wins because again I think (32:40 - 32:46)
people are under estimating the amount (32:42 - 32:50)
of casual people that don't specifically (32:46 - 32:54)
care about whether something is good or (32:50 - 32:57)
not a lot of people just really like (32:54 - 32:59)
Dragonite and if they started playing (32:57 - 33:02)
literally any time after the dratini (32:59 - 33:04)
community day and they don't spend money (33:02 - 33:07)
on incubators they probably don't have a (33:04 - 33:09)
lot of dratini (33:07 - 33:11)
and I can't remember the last time I (33:09 - 33:14)
found her tini in the wild that wasn't (33:11 - 33:17)
maybe like a one-off event where they (33:14 - 33:19)
did for a weekend where dratini spawned (33:17 - 33:21)
I mean unless you're counting those like (33:19 - 33:23)
octo are that December kamini day stuff (33:21 - 33:25)
but even then there wasn't that many (33:23 - 33:29)
dratini - that's what I think I think (33:25 - 33:32)
that like all of the aya I don't think (33:29 - 33:33)
there's a guaranteed winner in this (33:32 - 33:37)
batch even though people might point to (33:33 - 33:39)
the obvious of it being Rhyhorn because (33:37 - 33:41)
it's not shiny and it's a good attacker (33:39 - 33:43)
I just I'm voting for Vulpix (33:41 - 33:45)
I don't care I just use a little cutie (33:43 - 33:49)
yep last bit of news is the lunar event (33:45 - 33:51)
is happening now and there will be a (33:49 - 33:54)
Mitch Min Chino community today when (33:51 - 33:56)
you're listening to this on Monday it (33:54 - 33:58)
would be the upcoming Sunday it would be (33:56 - 34:00)
on what was that February 2nd I think (33:58 - 34:02)
February 2nd yep (34:00 - 34:06)
let's take a break when we come back we (34:02 - 34:09)
have some Pokemon cake and some global (34:06 - 34:13)
linked news we will be right back (34:09 - 34:34)
[Music] (34:13 - 34:34)
[Music] (34:37 - 34:50)
[Applause] (34:48 - 34:53)
[Music] (34:50 - 34:53)
this was sent in by Gabe up from our (34:53 - 35:00)
attic channel in slack off Kotaku the (34:56 - 35:03)
Pokemon cakes episode of Food Network (35:00 - 35:08)
challenge is a glorious mess in last (35:03 - 35:09)
night's episode of the competitive (35:08 - 35:11)
cooking show Food Network challenge for (35:09 - 35:15)
professional Baker's needs to be a big (35:11 - 35:17)
asterisk there attempted to create cakes (35:15 - 35:21)
resembling popular Pocket Monsters you (35:17 - 35:24)
make a squirtle cake in two hours (35:21 - 35:25)
in the first round of the new episode (35:24 - 35:27)
which is available on Food Network's (35:25 - 35:29)
website bakers were given two hours to (35:27 - 35:31)
create edible versions of Pokemon (35:29 - 35:34)
characters once completed the creations (35:31 - 35:36)
would be judged by a panel of baking (35:34 - 35:39)
experts and one competitive competing (35:36 - 35:41)
Baker would be eliminating via a (35:39 - 35:43)
remaining three would go on to round two (35:41 - 35:46)
building another Pokemon to face off in (35:43 - 35:48)
the battle scene oh it's very obvious (35:46 - 35:49)
who will lost the first round will (35:48 - 35:53)
describe to me this sob --all all right (35:49 - 35:57)
this apple doesn't look too bad compared (35:53 - 36:00)
to some of the other ones I mean it (35:57 - 36:02)
looks like a sob well maybe the head's a (36:00 - 36:07)
little too big but a lot of what's that (36:02 - 36:12)
stuff called bond' icing a fondant that (36:07 - 36:17)
you're not supposed to eat you don't (36:12 - 36:20)
want to but you can yeah but it's (36:17 - 36:23)
sitting on a lily pad that's that's I (36:20 - 36:26)
applaud their innovation for having to (36:23 - 36:28)
stop Alana literally pad like that not (36:26 - 36:31)
sure what the little fin on the top of (36:28 - 36:34)
its head is made out of that's that's (36:31 - 36:35)
definitely different (36:34 - 36:38)
certainly it's real lucky but losing (36:35 - 36:40)
rail blocking didn't didn't do so good (36:38 - 36:44)
on the on the hands of the feet I like (36:40 - 36:46)
how its head comes to like a complete (36:44 - 36:49)
like 90 degree angle yep yep it's got (36:46 - 36:51)
just two little pokes in the front for (36:49 - 36:54)
his nose like just look Gregg described (36:51 - 36:57)
as Litton to me (36:54 - 37:01)
okay have you ever seen a doll made from (36:57 - 37:06)
1800s yeah basically it's like a sack (37:01 - 37:09)
filled with sawdust with arms stretched (37:06 - 37:12)
straight out it kind of made me think of (37:09 - 37:17)
Gumby baby of Goliath Davey and Goliath (37:12 - 37:20)
Gumby and Davey those are probably more (37:17 - 37:23)
animated in this monstrosity the head is (37:20 - 37:25)
pretty good like they got they got the (37:23 - 37:27)
head good but I also one whisker coming (37:25 - 37:30)
out of its I was here coming out of its (37:27 - 37:34)
eye the head is also not the right size (37:30 - 37:37)
for that body which my learned from Katz (37:34 - 37:39)
the movie is a problem maybe they just (37:37 - 37:42)
got done seeing cats they were inspired (37:39 - 37:44)
they are inspired to make this I mean (37:42 - 37:49)
this is not a Jellicle it's not the (37:44 - 37:51)
delicate choice I'll tell you that much (37:49 - 37:55)
I mean all all the all the pieces are (37:51 - 37:56)
there (37:55 - 37:59)
it's unhappy that's for sure yeah and it (37:56 - 38:01)
definitely has a whisker coming out of (37:59 - 38:03)
its eyeball why wouldn't you make a (38:01 - 38:06)
linen that was on all four legs rather (38:03 - 38:08)
than trying to make one standing up (38:06 - 38:11)
cause it's gonna fight just letting this (38:08 - 38:14)
her fight no yeah I don't know cuz don't (38:11 - 38:16)
you with like these cakes don't cheese (38:14 - 38:19)
wires on the inside yeah there are bid (38:16 - 38:24)
so there is you - yeah - like that and (38:19 - 38:26)
they probably use rice krispies to make (38:24 - 38:28)
all these things that cake is a real (38:26 - 38:31)
stretch of them you know what probably (38:28 - 38:33)
the most disturbing about the little one (38:31 - 38:36)
is the fact that the whiskers actually (38:33 - 38:38)
look like another set of baby doll arms (38:36 - 38:43)
yeah that is that is probably the most (38:38 - 38:47)
well described this beautiful chikorita (38:43 - 38:50)
I'm looking at the chikorita I think is (38:47 - 38:52)
the worst of them all they they didn't (38:50 - 38:56)
put the little necklace on it at all I (38:52 - 38:58)
don't think that was the perfect (38:56 - 38:59)
[Music] (38:58 - 39:03)
the its it's just not the right (38:59 - 39:06)
proportions I feel like they pulled up a (39:03 - 39:09)
picture of bay leaf and chikorita they (39:06 - 39:10)
didn't know there was a difference (39:09 - 39:15)
between the two yeah yeah welcome to Bay (39:10 - 39:15)
Arita (39:15 - 39:18)
it's like Chikorita was evolving and (39:15 - 39:19)
they like jammed on the B button real (39:18 - 39:22)
quick and then made a kick out of it and (39:19 - 39:27)
the hind legs are no it looks like they (39:22 - 39:30)
started making a brontosaurus and when (39:27 - 39:33)
that's not right it has a leaf on its (39:30 - 39:35)
head it also looks like its stomach is (39:33 - 39:38)
about to puke out all the inward innards (39:35 - 39:44)
yeah yeah not puke it's more like alien (39:38 - 39:47)
facehugger that kind of thing than a out (39:44 - 39:50)
of the body yeah the eyes are cute (39:47 - 39:53)
the the sob of the Litton and the (39:50 - 39:56)
Chikorita went against a very very well (39:53 - 40:00)
done Mudkip that also except the Mudkip (39:56 - 40:01)
is grotesque (40:00 - 40:05)
well good it squirts water hey Joe (40:01 - 40:09)
nobody needs a cake that squirts it (40:05 - 40:13)
first look only in Europe do they dip (40:09 - 40:16)
their cake into liquids our first you (40:13 - 40:18)
covered it being grotesque by calling it (40:16 - 40:21)
Mudkip second Oh innovative how they got (40:18 - 40:23)
it to squirt water by sticking a tube (40:21 - 40:26)
through it that's nothing its (40:23 - 40:28)
proportions are really good too (40:26 - 40:32)
yeah but also once again why is Mudkip (40:28 - 40:35)
standing on two legs this is a water gun (40:32 - 40:38)
you don't have to stand up to water gun (40:35 - 40:41)
I have used that move plenty of times (40:38 - 40:44)
okay so then round two went on time but (40:41 - 40:45)
it doesn't say here but I'm pretty sure (40:44 - 40:51)
the chikorita lost these other pictures (40:45 - 40:54)
number two Greg described to me this (40:51 - 40:58)
Pikachu so it's a it's the new version (40:54 - 41:01)
of Pikachu it's much thinner it's (40:58 - 41:03)
jumping through a hoop for some reason (41:01 - 41:05)
and instead of actually having hands (41:03 - 41:08)
they gave it to tasers they really did (41:05 - 41:10)
give it like they gave me today so I was (41:08 - 41:12)
but going to be charitable and (41:10 - 41:13)
that they were fireworks shooting out of (41:12 - 41:16)
its hands but no that's a piece of (41:13 - 41:18)
electronics this works yeah it's there (41:16 - 41:21)
too Tasers it's got no hands it's guy do (41:18 - 41:24)
Tasers why it's mouth is just like (41:21 - 41:26)
there's just something (41:24 - 41:28)
disproportionately wrong about that (41:26 - 41:30)
we're like the mouth and the cheeks and (41:28 - 41:34)
the it's uh and it's not the worst let's (41:30 - 41:37)
be honest so Pikachu you know the world (41:34 - 41:39)
looks like a Pikachu that's gonna tase (41:37 - 41:43)
ya made by the Mudkip girl yeah I'm (41:39 - 41:45)
concerned that they have the water (41:43 - 41:50)
squirting hand tase hand like where did (41:45 - 41:53)
she get the water and like did she prep (41:50 - 41:54)
this did she like know that she was (41:53 - 41:56)
gonna make Pikachu and she brought it (41:54 - 42:00)
know everybody they just basically use (41:56 - 42:02)
sugar so for sugar sculpting you have (42:00 - 42:04)
the big plunger that you put the sugar (42:02 - 42:06)
in and then you can you can put it into (42:04 - 42:08)
tube so that it hardens easy so you can (42:06 - 42:10)
sculpt sugar so there's basically just (42:08 - 42:13)
use the existing candy making apparatus (42:10 - 42:16)
just shove a tube up mudkip and have (42:13 - 42:18)
that shoot water out they just use that (42:16 - 42:20)
like those are fairly common baking (42:18 - 42:22)
supplies for decorating yeah but the (42:20 - 42:23)
fireworks I don't think is a fairly the (42:22 - 42:26)
fire I'm not sure she pulled the Taser (42:23 - 42:29)
from apart from maybe like her (42:26 - 42:31)
belongings like I'll just attach the (42:29 - 42:34)
Taser here we'll can you describe the (42:31 - 42:38)
squirtle well I mean it's very happy ah (42:34 - 42:43)
it kind of resembles the rainbow (42:38 - 42:47)
squirtle book cover yeah kind of uh (42:43 - 42:54)
tales wrong it's about twice the size of (42:47 - 42:54)
Linton's gone baby if we make it bigger (42:55 - 43:04)
it'll be easier to sculpt I'm sure the (42:59 - 43:07)
shell is (43:04 - 43:10)
submerged underwater I'll be charitable (43:07 - 43:13)
it is submerged under the wave that it's (43:10 - 43:15)
coming behind the squirtle it's clearly (43:13 - 43:18)
summoning surf it's like a giant surfing (43:15 - 43:21)
wave to come crush this tiny little (43:18 - 43:26)
creepy nineteen hundred's doll Lytton (43:21 - 43:26)
scary looking but the best for last (43:26 - 43:34)
because I from what I can tell us they (43:31 - 43:35)
all had to be doing some sort of attack (43:34 - 43:40)
like they all had to do something yeah I (43:35 - 43:41)
don't think as of this recording the (43:40 - 43:43)
final episode is aired yet because we (43:41 - 43:45)
went from four to three and then I would (43:43 - 43:48)
assume it would go to three - yeah but (43:45 - 43:49)
they're different they have a different (43:48 - 43:53)
challenge every week so it depends on (43:49 - 43:56)
which way they usually eliminate a (43:53 - 43:58)
second and then they do a third Rawdon (43:56 - 44:00)
and who declare the winner in a lot of (43:58 - 44:03)
them so it could be that there's one (44:00 - 44:05)
more thing they had to do well it (44:03 - 44:07)
doesn't say who made the Bulbasaur but (44:05 - 44:09)
I'm assuming it's the Saba person since (44:07 - 44:11)
Chikorita person definitely got knocked (44:09 - 44:15)
out most likely yeah unless they skipped (44:11 - 44:18)
what the samel person made and we're (44:15 - 44:21)
assuming that the Mudkip person made the (44:18 - 44:22)
bubble sir I mean all of these things (44:21 - 44:25)
look like they had to pick one that (44:22 - 44:27)
match the type weaknesses so I'm (44:25 - 44:30)
imagining that the bubble SAR was (44:27 - 44:34)
against the sambal and it shoots leaves (44:30 - 44:35)
which are very cute (44:34 - 44:37)
yeah it's really so this episode will be (44:35 - 44:40)
on today at 4:00 p.m. central for those (44:37 - 44:42)
of us who have the Food Network boy (44:40 - 44:45)
somebody won $10,000 for making one of (44:42 - 44:48)
these monstrosities yeah they did Bob (44:45 - 44:49)
Lazar is actually really good though (44:48 - 44:53)
yeah so this look I can see the whole (44:49 - 44:54)
Bulbasaur (44:53 - 44:55)
why is it suspended in the air like that (44:54 - 44:59)
sure the leaves shut itself up with vine (44:55 - 45:03)
whip so this looks like it is this the (44:59 - 45:05)
one where they all complete all in one (45:03 - 45:07)
show so there should be another (45:05 - 45:09)
challenge after this (45:07 - 45:13)
episode 3 is wizard of odds cakes which (45:09 - 45:15)
that looked like they did a much better (45:13 - 45:16)
job but I just said the way Food Network (45:15 - 45:18)
challenges yeah they finish the (45:16 - 45:20)
challenge every episode and then it's a (45:18 - 45:24)
different challenge so let the previous (45:20 - 45:25)
episode - this was Back to the Future (45:24 - 45:27)
cakes and then next week it's gay (45:25 - 45:32)
monopoly cakes that chikorita Baker (45:27 - 45:33)
should be very disappointed with (45:32 - 45:39)
themselves almost like the easiest (45:33 - 45:42)
Pokemon to do because it's just a stupid (45:39 - 45:46)
pair thing blob with a bunch of blobs (45:42 - 45:48)
are unjust next how did you go so wrong (45:46 - 45:51)
I'm telling you it looks like they (45:48 - 45:52)
pulled up a picture of bay leaf and (45:51 - 45:54)
didn't realize it was a different poke (45:52 - 45:57)
probably must have I think they the only (45:54 - 45:59)
thing easier would be to like to have (45:57 - 46:03)
made a dit oh yeah just a ditto cake but (45:59 - 46:05)
even if they did a bay leaf it into the (46:03 - 46:08)
necklace no I know that's that's got the (46:05 - 46:11)
body and all you have to do is take what (46:08 - 46:13)
are those like the little candies that I (46:11 - 46:16)
like the lime ones the green like green (46:13 - 46:19)
spice drops yeah just do that and a ring (46:16 - 46:23)
around the things neck done that show (46:19 - 46:25)
next time we have a year to learn how to (46:23 - 46:30)
bake oh you make the whole round things (46:25 - 46:35)
a circle circle cakes are hard look at (46:30 - 46:38)
how many heads they made magic cake or a (46:35 - 46:40)
circle cake what are you talking here no (46:38 - 46:42)
like like a lot of the Baker's got the (46:40 - 46:45)
circle shape right like Linton's head is (46:42 - 46:47)
good mudkips head is good this was my (46:45 - 46:57)
challenge is a charge of my I just III (46:47 - 47:00)
outside of this whole discussion of this (46:57 - 47:01)
particular I don't understand the whole (47:00 - 47:04)
I want a cake that's actually a (47:01 - 47:06)
sculpture I want a cake I can eat I want (47:04 - 47:08)
a sheet cake that I can grab by the (47:06 - 47:10)
fistful and shove down my throat and (47:08 - 47:13)
that is better be delicious then but no (47:10 - 47:17)
don't waste this is wasteful yeah but (47:13 - 47:18)
that's what weddings do they make a (47:17 - 47:20)
pretty cake that you won't eat and then (47:18 - 47:21)
there's like 50 sheet cakes in the back (47:20 - 47:22)
that they served ever (47:21 - 47:25)
and then they'd steal the cake and yeah (47:22 - 47:26)
that's true (47:25 - 47:28)
here's what they should have done this (47:26 - 47:32)
years all done Pokemon quests cakes cuz (47:28 - 47:34)
they're all square yeah they're really (47:32 - 47:37)
done and done I don't think some of them (47:34 - 47:40)
were educated in Pokemon he has a point (47:37 - 47:44)
to hurry to girl this was a relief this (47:40 - 47:47)

channel in slack off pokemon.com Mewtwo (47:47 - 48:00)
strikes back evolution on Netflix I so (47:52 - 48:03)
just to step this back a second this is (48:00 - 48:04)
the movie we were supposed to get in (48:03 - 48:07)
November of 2018 that everybody was like (48:04 - 48:09)
oh I guess we're not getting that movie (48:07 - 48:12)
right yep that yep okay this was the (48:09 - 48:15)
movie that did extremely well in Japan (48:12 - 48:18)
in Korea (48:15 - 48:21)
and never came to the United States let (48:18 - 48:25)

the first movie which was originally (48:53 - 48:59)
released in North America 1999 the new (48:55 - 49:03)
might was a major hit when it debuted in (48:59 - 49:05)
Japan last year and became one of the (49:03 - 49:07)
top grossing films during the opening (49:05 - 49:10)
weekend there in pok√©mon Mewtwo strikes (49:07 - 49:13)
back evolution researchers discover and (49:10 - 49:16)
exploit max ray dents in order to get (49:13 - 49:18)
shiny pokemon oh hold on researchers (49:16 - 49:22)
discover and and exploit a fossil of the (49:18 - 49:25)
mythical Pokemon Mew unleashing a (49:22 - 49:27)
creation that goes against the very laws (49:25 - 49:32)
of nature Mewtwo a legendary Pokemon (49:27 - 49:35)
intended for a for use as a tool of (49:32 - 49:41)
destruction but NSU becomes aware of its (49:35 - 49:45)
own dubious origin it begins to resent (49:41 - 49:48)
its human creators and seeks revenge ash (49:45 - 49:51)
Pikachu and their friends find (49:48 - 49:55)
themselves at the center of its rampage (49:51 - 50:00)
Mewtwo's evolution will debut on Netflix (49:55 - 50:06)
February 27th Pokemon Day Oh in time for (50:00 - 50:07)
my anniversary if you're not following (50:06 - 50:09)
the what are they calling it the (50:07 - 50:15)
streaming wars right now Netflix is in (50:09 - 50:17)
losing I don't think they're losing I (50:15 - 50:19)
don't think they're losing Netflix is in (50:17 - 50:23)
a competition with like HBO and Disney (50:19 - 50:26)
right now and Apple those are probably (50:23 - 50:28)
the big four right Disney Apple HBO and (50:26 - 50:32)
Netflix because (50:28 - 50:39)
Disney onto Lu so I guess I hate saying (50:32 - 50:42)
Apple wait wait but about YouTube TV (50:39 - 50:44)
that's it doesn't make give up on (50:42 - 50:45)
original content (50:44 - 50:48)
oh oh you mean and create the weight (50:45 - 50:51)
buying a Pokemon movie is not original (50:48 - 50:53)
content no well I mean its original and (50:51 - 50:55)
the fact that literally the only place (50:53 - 50:57)
you can see it like that that in itself (50:55 - 51:01)
is exclusive content its exclusive (50:57 - 51:02)
concept it's not original content I'm (51:01 - 51:06)
curious of how long so it's it's not (51:02 - 51:07)
surprising to me that like this movie is (51:06 - 51:10)
coming to Netflix it's more interesting (51:07 - 51:13)
to me of like how long this was this (51:10 - 51:17)
deal was in the works because I'm sure (51:13 - 51:20)
Netflix probably paid a pretty penny for (51:17 - 51:23)
this not probably because this movie is (51:20 - 51:25)
going to be particularly good I mean the (51:23 - 51:28)
first meet like muties Mewtwo the first (51:25 - 51:31)
Pokemon movies not great it's fine what (51:28 - 51:36)
but it's like if everyone just took off (51:31 - 51:39)
their nostalgia glasses that movie you (51:36 - 51:41)
know I refuse to take off my nostalgia (51:39 - 51:42)
glass that's will be ant making that (51:41 - 51:46)
movie is like 20 minutes of Mewtwo at (51:42 - 51:48)
the end of all the Pokemon brainlessly (51:46 - 51:52)
fighting each other and then it's like (51:48 - 51:55)
all of this time waste of how Ash and (51:52 - 51:59)
company get to the island like a lot of (51:55 - 52:00)
people I think forget that part of the (51:59 - 52:03)
movie but this your your version of time (52:00 - 52:05)
wasting my version of time we serve (52:03 - 52:07)
vastly different that is a rich (52:05 - 52:09)
character background they spend so much (52:07 - 52:12)
time in like if there's not even a (52:09 - 52:14)
pokemons that it's like a warehouse it's (52:12 - 52:17)
like trying to decide how to get to this (52:14 - 52:21)
island you certainly remember this movie (52:17 - 52:22)
much differently than I do (52:21 - 52:24)
there's it's pretty it's a pretty boring (52:22 - 52:27)
movie the Pokemon companies we've (52:24 - 52:29)
learned one thing they're really good at (52:27 - 52:32)
making money so I'm sure they got paid (52:29 - 52:34)
very well by Netflix to have this movie (52:32 - 52:39)
on Netflix overall it's interesting that (52:34 - 52:40)
we didn't get this movie when we were (52:39 - 52:44)
supposed to because (52:40 - 52:48)
so back up the truck the Pokemon company (52:44 - 52:52)
okay so whether or not (52:48 - 52:56)
youth you you like to let's go Pikachu (52:52 - 52:57)
let's go Eevee (52:56 - 53:02)
let's go Pikachu let's go Evie was a a a (52:57 - 53:06)
game that used the gen7 engine so they (53:02 - 53:08)
didn't really have to remake an entire (53:06 - 53:12)
engine like they did for gen8 they (53:08 - 53:15)
needed more time with gen8 saw that the (53:12 - 53:18)
switch was finally successful and they (53:15 - 53:20)
figured that remaking pokemon yellow (53:18 - 53:22)
which is what let's go pikachu let's go (53:20 - 53:25)
Eevee is it's a remake or in their words (53:22 - 53:27)
a rematch a reimagining which they use (53:25 - 53:28)
here in Mewtwo strikes back (53:27 - 53:31)
so remake remaking reimagining pokemon (53:28 - 53:33)
yellow on the switch was the right (53:31 - 53:36)
choice so some would argue it was the (53:33 - 53:39)
right choice because Pokemon ko was an (53:36 - 53:41)
undeniable success those people are (53:39 - 53:44)
right some people would say it was they (53:41 - 53:48)
did it because people love Gen 1 which (53:44 - 53:52)
is undeniably true those people are (53:48 - 53:54)
right and then some people would say (53:52 - 53:56)
they only did this because they needed (53:54 - 53:59)
one game a year and those people are (53:56 - 54:02)
right as well there's no reason why the (53:59 - 54:04)
Pokemon company shouldn't put out one (54:02 - 54:06)
game of wait a year if it sells 11 (54:04 - 54:11)
million copies that's a lot of copies so (54:06 - 54:13)
all those people are right but on top of (54:11 - 54:16)
that it's there wasn't that wasn't a (54:13 - 54:21)
coincidence that they took the time like (54:16 - 54:23)
they didn't they didn't make let's go (54:21 - 54:24)
with the like oh we need to put (54:23 - 54:26)
something out like they all they planned (54:24 - 54:30)
let's go and they plan to remake the (54:26 - 54:33)
first Pokemon movie at the same time (54:30 - 54:34)
they like 100% knew what they were doing (54:33 - 54:37)
they were capitalizing on nostalgia and (54:34 - 54:40)
I'm Pokemon go player sure but that the (54:37 - 54:43)
the goal was we're going to put out (54:40 - 54:46)
a childhood favorite pokemon yellow and (54:43 - 54:49)
we're gonna put out the Mewtwo movie (54:46 - 54:52)
again which is also a childhood favorite (54:49 - 54:54)
at the same time and capitalize on that (54:52 - 54:57)
and they did that successfully in Japan (54:54 - 55:01)
but for whatever reason I don't know if (54:57 - 55:03)
they couldn't strike a deal with (55:01 - 55:06)
theaters because that movie would have (55:03 - 55:08)
done well here it would have done that (55:06 - 55:11)
I think definitely yeah it would have (55:08 - 55:13)
been been great I think a lot of people (55:11 - 55:14)
would have been like I love the first (55:13 - 55:16)
movie and now it's a CGI version of it (55:14 - 55:17)
heck yeah (55:16 - 55:20)
so that's that's the that's the like (55:17 - 55:22)
takeaway from this entire conversation (55:20 - 55:24)
is like I don't think we'll ever know (55:22 - 55:26)
what happened of like why this movie (55:24 - 55:29)
didn't make it to theaters (55:26 - 55:30)
like yeah sure Pokemon Day is a (55:29 - 55:33)
convenient time but I'm sure they they (55:30 - 55:35)
secured that deal a long time like I'm (55:33 - 55:37)
sure they secured that deal a couple (55:35 - 55:38)
months ago and they were like well let's (55:37 - 55:40)
just hold it to pokemon day because (55:38 - 55:43)
there was a Mewtwo distribution in let's (55:40 - 55:44)
go in Japan (55:43 - 55:47)
there was a mute then at one point we (55:44 - 55:49)
randomly got a me-too distribution in (55:47 - 55:51)
the UK and they decided to tie that in (55:49 - 55:54)
with a TCG release and then right before (55:51 - 55:55)
sword and shield came out they were like (55:54 - 55:57)
well we might as well give you guys your (55:55 - 55:59)
Mewtwo I guess Best Buy gave us some (55:57 - 56:01)
money so here's Mewtwo and let's go (55:59 - 56:03)
right before sword and shield came out (56:01 - 56:05)
which is fine but like you know they (56:03 - 56:07)
were saving the Mewtwo for this movie (56:05 - 56:10)
that never came out and I don't think a (56:07 - 56:11)
lot of people put two and two together (56:10 - 56:12)
like the reason they made that remade (56:11 - 56:15)
this movie was the same reason they (56:12 - 56:16)
remade let's go they were going to put (56:15 - 56:18)
them out at the same time together and (56:16 - 56:21)
it just again goes to show you that the (56:18 - 56:23)
Pokemon company is really good at (56:21 - 56:25)
hitting on all these cylinders that (56:23 - 56:27)
other companies aren't doing like they (56:25 - 56:29)
don't just brainlessly put out games or (56:27 - 56:31)
movies without this supplemental content (56:29 - 56:33)
to benefit each other they're really (56:31 - 56:35)
smart at this they're really good at (56:33 - 56:38)
this but for some reason this movie (56:35 - 56:40)
didn't make it out in the United States (56:38 - 56:43)
or anywhere else outside of Korea in (56:40 - 56:46)
Japan in 2018 (56:43 - 56:48)
it may be that they always distribute (56:46 - 56:52)
through the called yeah and that they (56:48 - 56:54)
may be phantom is not doing so good yeah (56:52 - 56:57)
I remember emailing phantom and I said (56:54 - 56:59)
like when are you guys doing tickets for (56:57 - 57:00)
this one this is coming and they were (56:59 - 57:01)
like oh we have we haven't heard (57:00 - 57:03)
anything from the Pokemon company about (57:01 - 57:07)
this movie yet so maybe that's where the (57:03 - 57:09)
rift is (57:07 - 57:11)
I mean they're still doing a lot of (57:09 - 57:13)
events I see their ads all the time (57:11 - 57:16)
Bantam yeah yeah but it may be that the (57:13 - 57:18)
Pokemon events weren't making that much (57:16 - 57:21)
money for him probably not enough to yep (57:18 - 57:24)
I know I know the power of us didn't do (57:21 - 57:26)
well in theaters but I choose you did (57:24 - 57:32)
because people like John won yep (57:26 - 57:32)
well once bitten twice shy there you go (57:32 - 57:38)

the P in the p GL communication trading (62:23 - 62:30)
infrared will we can still trade locally (62:26 - 62:35)
nice thank goodness Q our rental teams (62:30 - 62:37)
QR codes can no longer be used however (62:35 - 62:41)
if you have saved QR codes you are fine (62:37 - 62:44)
don't delete them though battle videos (62:41 - 62:48)
this is not make use of the p GL so you (62:44 - 62:50)
are allowed to save your battle videos (62:48 - 62:52)
still that is everything that is (62:50 - 62:56)
happening when the p GL shuts down I (62:52 - 62:58)
hope no one listening to the show got a (62:56 - 63:01)
heart attack well I just need to output (62:58 - 63:04)
my records of like all my playthrough (63:01 - 63:07)
records that are stored on the p GL to a (63:04 - 63:09)
PDF and then i'll have them forever yep (63:07 - 63:14)
that's how you do it how will we know (63:09 - 63:17)
what the most petted Pokemon is the page (63:14 - 63:20)
that yeah I know if the pgl is shutting (63:17 - 63:23)
down its the sylveon I think it's still (63:20 - 63:28)
in center oh I think it was ever not in (63:23 - 63:33)
sinner or rip the pgl was not great it (63:28 - 63:35)
wasn't terrible horrible I mean is (63:33 - 63:38)
better than a lot of things it was it (63:35 - 63:40)
was definitely restricting in in the (63:38 - 63:43)
sense of like competitions and (63:40 - 63:45)
distributions right like if you wanted (63:43 - 63:48)
to participate in the everyone hatch a (63:45 - 63:50)
million eggs you had to go to the pgl (63:48 - 63:53)
first link your game talk to the lady in (63:50 - 63:56)
the festival Plaza for her do you think (63:53 - 63:58)
that's what I was going to say that the (63:56 - 64:00)
way that they made it work was a bit (63:58 - 64:03)
clunky sure like there are a lot of (64:00 - 64:05)
steps they were very very protective of (64:03 - 64:09)
their free service for children so yeah (64:05 - 64:12)
there are some clunkiness to it but once (64:09 - 64:15)
you knew how to do it it wasn't terrible (64:12 - 64:18)
is is the new way easier sure you're (64:15 - 64:21)
also paying 20 bucks for it so now you (64:18 - 64:21)
know where your money went (64:21 - 64:24)
I would I would always pay $20 for (64:21 - 64:26)
convenience (64:24 - 64:30)
well so the my issue is the nice thing (64:26 - 64:32)
about the pgl was there was a one (64:30 - 64:34)
website that you could go to and then (64:32 - 64:36)
you can see like all your records you (64:34 - 64:39)
can see about competitions and all your (64:36 - 64:41)
milestones and everything were uploaded (64:39 - 64:42)
there I mean a lot of people didn't know (64:41 - 64:43)
that they could look there to see their (64:42 - 64:47)
milestone it's like and I don't know if (64:43 - 64:48)
there's a website like a corresponding (64:47 - 64:51)
website any longer huh come on home you (64:48 - 64:54)
may be getting a lot of promises about (64:51 - 64:56)
Pokemon home and when they don't deliver (64:54 - 64:59)
I'm gonna be real sad okay that's my (64:56 - 65:01)
that's my jam making you're real sad for (64:59 - 65:06)
the promises 306 million Pokemon as of (65:01 - 65:10)
this recording traded via the GTS in the (65:06 - 65:15)
Sun and Moon games Wow an ultra 306 (65:10 - 65:19)
million and then there's a picture of (65:15 - 65:22)
Papa Leo so I think actually what (65:19 - 65:24)
they're saying is through mommy only on (65:22 - 65:26)
Papa Leo got traded Pokemon refresh (65:24 - 65:29)
number one is in center or still yeah I (65:26 - 65:31)
guess that's like kind of the weird (65:29 - 65:35)
thing with sword and shield is like I'm (65:31 - 65:38)
at the pgl right now I can see the most (65:35 - 65:41)
used QR teams for double battles that's (65:38 - 65:45)
available here they all include Landorus (65:41 - 65:49)
spoiler I can see the raiding battles (65:45 - 65:50)
for trainer ratings of all matched (65:49 - 65:52)
formats I can see somebody's Japanese (65:50 - 65:55)
name they have 7,000 points spoiler (65:52 - 65:57)
they're all Japanese names except for (65:55 - 65:59)
this one person named son (65:57 - 66:02)
I can see some news look the GDL was (65:59 - 66:03)
real garbage you know how hard it was to (66:02 - 66:05)
redeem and sign up for those top ooh (66:03 - 66:09)
cocoa topple Ella events did not make it (66:05 - 66:12)
clear not hard no it was like four (66:09 - 66:15)
clicks oh no the more click and that's (66:12 - 66:17)
that's if you got the four clicks like (66:15 - 66:19)
if you if you knew exactly where to (66:17 - 66:21)
click look it took me forever to get my (66:19 - 66:24)
Munna because when you click on the like (66:21 - 66:26)
notification Munna is here it takes you (66:24 - 66:27)
to a different web page which explains (66:26 - 66:28)
it to you but doesn't tell you how to (66:27 - 66:31)
get it yeah that sounds about right for (66:28 - 66:34)
the gloomy cuz it's like oh you click (66:31 - 66:35)
the raw you were supposed to click the (66:34 - 66:37)
Lugg the mini text in the upper left (66:35 - 66:40)
hand corner it was it was fine a like 9 (66:37 - 66:43)
years is way too long to keep a single (66:40 - 66:46)
system true I mean think of how many (66:43 - 66:48)
games we've gone through in those nine (66:46 - 66:52)
years that it's been supporting (66:48 - 66:55)
like six hopefully Pokemon home has (66:52 - 66:57)
something I hope so (66:55 - 66:59)
it's gonna have all these great records (66:57 - 67:01)
doesn't tell you how many shinies you (66:59 - 67:03)
got how many raids you did how many (67:01 - 67:05)
friends you have to be probably any (67:03 - 67:06)
shuffle as you shuffled it's gonna be (67:05 - 67:09)

sword and shield but it's if you love (68:25 - 68:30)
sandslash if they put on a box is it (68:27 - 68:32)
good oh I don't think it's particularly (68:30 - 68:37)
dirty spikey shield if this Pokemon is (68:32 - 68:39)
your Active Pokemon and is damaged by an (68:37 - 68:42)
opponent's attack even if this pokemon (68:39 - 68:44)
is knocked out put three damage counters (68:42 - 68:48)
on the attacking Pokemon oh and it has (68:44 - 68:51)
frost breath for a blue and two (68:48 - 68:53)
colorless but they got rid of double (68:51 - 68:56)
colorless energy right yeah yeah for 120 (68:53 - 68:59)
and then it's got a GX it in the pok√©mon (68:56 - 69:02)
Global Link left together Wow (68:59 - 69:05)
spikey storm GX this attack does 100 (69:02 - 69:07)
damage to each of your opponent's (69:05 - 69:11)
Pokemon that has any damage counters on (69:07 - 69:14)
it bummer (69:11 - 69:14)
show doesn't sound good but if you (69:14 - 69:19)
combine it with something that does like (69:17 - 69:21)
spreads damage and moves damage around (69:19 - 69:24)
sure it looks like oh I'm seeing from (69:21 - 69:26)
the picture yeah - cosmic eclipses those (69:24 - 69:29)
are good unified minds also good but I (69:26 - 69:32)
can see back there upper left they're (69:29 - 69:38)
sticking in a pack of steam Siege good (69:32 - 69:41)
not good like not everything can be (69:38 - 69:42)
winners Oh (69:41 - 69:45)
as somebody who is still bitter about (69:42 - 69:47)
getting three Crimson Invasion cards at (69:45 - 69:50)
the Pokemon world championships you're (69:47 - 69:52)
absolutely right we all can't be winners (69:50 - 69:57)
here I guess me possibly the worst three (69:52 - 69:59)
booster packs that was printed in the (69:57 - 70:00)
last two years (69:59 - 70:04)
crimson invasion is like ice I have it's (70:00 - 70:07)
been seven months I've still not opened (70:04 - 70:09)
those packs because they're worth at (70:07 - 70:12)
least three dollars sealed there were (70:09 - 70:16)
nothing if I open them that way who are (70:12 - 70:19)
you gonna sell them to look I gotta let (70:16 - 70:21)
them age next to my ancient mute Greg (70:19 - 70:25)
hopefully one day buzz well GX will (70:21 - 70:27)
shine again I pity your (70:25 - 70:30)
great-grandchildren who gonna be like we (70:27 - 70:33)
got this box of useless cards from our (70:30 - 70:36)
ancestor burned them for fuel oh man (70:33 - 70:40)
hold on crimson invasion I'm trying to (70:36 - 70:42)
find a single eyes crimson invasion (70:40 - 70:44)
booster pack three dollars and 11 cents (70:42 - 70:47)
on TCG yep yep there and I think buzz (70:44 - 70:50)
will buzz swell GX is worth like 350 (70:47 - 70:53)
maybe and B string is like 80 cents and (70:50 - 70:55)
those are the two best cards from that (70:53 - 70:59)
set let me see what does s the best most (70:55 - 71:02)
expensive card in the set right now on (70:59 - 71:08)
page one two are there only two pages (71:02 - 71:09)
I got to look at it differently I'm (71:08 - 71:12)
apologize Wow how old is Christmas (71:09 - 71:15)
crimson invasion a little over a year I (71:12 - 71:18)
want to say because it has dropped off (71:15 - 71:23)
of the main TCG yeah it rotated it did (71:18 - 71:26)
rotate it as of August there we go it's (71:23 - 71:28)
part of the Sun and Moon seriously yep (71:26 - 71:30)
yeah here we go price high too low it's (71:28 - 71:33)
not that old (71:30 - 71:35)
okay so there was a secret water energy (71:33 - 71:38)
in twenty one dollars and seventy eight (71:35 - 71:42)
cents a secret Gyarados GX is 1805 while (71:38 - 71:44)
the water energy is worth more than the (71:42 - 71:49)
gear but you can have these in there (71:44 - 71:49)
there's not a lot of reasons why lol and (71:50 - 71:56)
Sam / should get its own box it's not (71:54 - 71:58)
like well aren't loose I mean you know (71:56 - 72:01)
it's not like like they're doing any lol (71:58 - 72:05)
on science / promotion and movies or TV (72:01 - 72:07)
shows or games I feel like the only (72:05 - 72:09)
reason I do this is they're like how can (72:07 - 72:13)
we reach I can we've sell these booster (72:09 - 72:17)
packs again has a packs of Steve's each (72:13 - 72:19)
lying around how can we get rid of and (72:17 - 72:20)
we need to get rid of them (72:19 - 72:23)
so I want to do some more research on (72:20 - 72:26)
this the because I skipped all of the (72:23 - 72:30)
X&Y series because I left the TCG when (72:26 - 72:32)
plasma freeze and all the plasma cards (72:30 - 72:36)
started flooding the markets when that (72:32 - 72:39)
was black and white - but the X and y is (72:36 - 72:41)
what introduced mega evolution and near (72:39 - 72:45)
the end of the X&Y set they produced a a (72:41 - 72:47)
set called X&Y (72:45 - 72:52)
evolutions which was a reprinting (72:47 - 72:54)
ironically this camera this came out (72:52 - 72:57)
around Pokemon go it was a reprinting of (72:54 - 72:59)
the the base set so like Charizard and (72:57 - 73:02)
chauncey and all the original cards got (72:59 - 73:05)
reprinted and slightly modified they (73:02 - 73:08)
were all still bad but except I think (73:05 - 73:10)
the Mewtwo is okay but they reprinted (73:08 - 73:13)
that and I guess they probably expected (73:10 - 73:15)
because of Pokemon go that these cards (73:13 - 73:17)
would sell well because of nostalgia but (73:15 - 73:22)
there are still to this day including XY (73:17 - 73:25)
evolutions in like hidden in tins like (73:22 - 73:26)
when you go to the store and you're like (73:25 - 73:30)
ah they got a new tin of Sun and Sun and (73:26 - 73:34)
Moon or sorry likes I'm sure when the (73:30 - 73:35)
sword and shield stuff comes out I'm (73:34 - 73:38)
confident that they will somehow find a (73:35 - 73:40)
way to stick XY evolutions behind all (73:38 - 73:43)
those other cards so you're like oh cool (73:40 - 73:46)
6 booster packs for sword and shield of (73:43 - 73:51)
seems stage and XY evolutions uh uh you (73:46 - 73:52)
know honestly I would take steam siege (73:51 - 73:55)
over crimson invasion steam some dinners (73:52 - 73:58)
have like mega and something I don't (73:55 - 74:00)
know and had something in it just open (73:58 - 74:03)
your packs and catch open your packs (74:00 - 74:04)
catch the throw look it's like a loot (74:03 - 74:06)
box you don't want to open the bad loot (74:04 - 74:07)
boxes (74:06 - 74:09)
what do you how do you know if it's a (74:07 - 74:13)
bad loop box until you open it yeah this (74:09 - 74:14)
is a good point (74:13 - 74:19)
it's like stroke open I know we didn't (74:14 - 74:21)
talk about this we got to talk about (74:19 - 74:23)
this real quick okay (74:21 - 74:26)
they released Darumaka in Pokemon go (74:23 - 74:29)
your the rad all the red pokemon they're (74:26 - 74:34)
restricting it to 7k eggs you know not (74:29 - 74:37)
only that but they decided to make more (74:34 - 74:41)
red pokemon up here in 7k eggs so not (74:37 - 74:45)
only do you have to open 7k eggs for dar (74:41 - 74:50)
maka they put Wurmple Vulpix shuckle in (74:45 - 74:54)
7k eggs alongside it (74:50 - 74:57)
you have any Vulpix I'm seeing (74:54 - 74:59)
and you expect me to walk seven (74:57 - 75:01)
kilometers to possibly get another (74:59 - 75:04)
Vulpix that's all yeah did you get a (75:01 - 75:06)
party hat work well yeah I did I got two (75:04 - 75:08)
of lokay cuz Greg and I both have them (75:06 - 75:12)

is not a fiber in my body that wants to (75:12 - 75:19)
buy incubators for Daraa mukha well then (75:15 - 75:21)
don't buy incubators just I'm not one (75:19 - 75:24)

the thing about the one you give me let (75:24 - 75:28)
me tell you what happened let me let me (75:25 - 75:30)

five kegs right now let me tell you (75:43 - 75:47)
what's in them all garbage by the time I (75:44 - 75:49)
get through maybe four of these 5k eggs (75:47 - 75:52)
this event will be over (75:49 - 75:54)
so either I wrote them away and just get (75:52 - 75:56)
seven keys I can't throw it you can't (75:54 - 75:59)
throw eggs you gotta hatch them well I (75:56 - 76:01)
mean I can hatch two five K's a day with (75:59 - 76:02)
minimal effort (76:01 - 76:07)
so okay look mr. legs some of us sir (76:02 - 76:10)
legs okay some of us don't leave our (76:07 - 76:13)
house some of us don't move very much (76:10 - 76:14)
from home (76:13 - 76:19)
I literally most of my specialty live on (76:14 - 76:23)
for 18 five and you gotta walk down all (76:19 - 76:25)
these stairs that's at least 2 7 k eggs (76:23 - 76:32)
a flight don't count no stairs count (76:25 - 76:32)
I'm almost positive stairs count for (76:32 - 76:36)
hatching eggs you're walking it right in (76:34 - 76:38)
a circle it's like now you're cheating (76:36 - 76:38)
the system (76:38 - 76:43)
yeah maybe adds it adds steps to I I am (76:38 - 76:46)
just saying at least partyhat Wurmple (76:43 - 76:49)
could have been shiny and at least there (76:46 - 76:52)
was other decent things and there's not (76:49 - 76:54)
a lot of decent things in some cakes but (76:52 - 76:56)
you could have got like full pics a (76:54 - 76:59)
little in Vulpix you could have got I (76:56 - 77:00)
don't know there's a couple other things (76:59 - 77:01)
you could have gotten better you gonna (77:00 - 77:03)
be when I get my dirt Darumaka (77:01 - 77:05)
you could have got like shiny ugly buff (77:03 - 77:08)
but the fact that they took out all the (77:05 - 77:14)
baby Pokemon and then put in Vulpix and (77:08 - 77:19)
chuckle and Wurmple ah this is this (77:14 - 77:21)
might be the worst thing they've done (77:19 - 77:23)
maybe not the worst it's an antic but (77:21 - 77:30)
it's it's okay I will wait (77:23 - 77:33)

loss from my 50 battle points I was very (80:45 - 80:49)

the week (81:28 - 81:31)
is going to be awful (81:29 - 81:35)
uh Ireland our last Pokemon of the week (81:31 - 81:36)
it wasn't a Pokemon (81:35 - 81:38)
[Music] (81:36 - 81:42)
and it was about a resident of anistar (81:38 - 81:45)
city so you had to think about anistar (81:42 - 81:49)
city with the Trinity of sigilyph (81:45 - 81:51)
sigilyph whatever you want to call it (81:49 - 81:57)
slow king meowstic female and they are (81:51 - 81:59)
known for their cloak with a star-filled (81:57 - 82:02)
pattern and a bracelet that can hold two (81:59 - 82:06)
wrists and they had a TCG card that (82:02 - 82:08)
worked like switch except it healed (82:06 - 82:11)
whatever Pokemon was sent to the bench (82:08 - 82:19)
who's that being it's bronzong uh not a (82:11 - 82:22)
Pokemon it's less yeah bras I was like a (82:19 - 82:26)
bell it's Olympia I don't know what had (82:22 - 82:28)
me thinking about Olympia two weeks ago (82:26 - 82:32)
but there was some reason why Olympia (82:28 - 82:35)
yeah the gym leader from a Star City (82:32 - 82:36)
know what she is (82:35 - 82:41)
do you yeah she had a pretty decent gym (82:36 - 82:45)
yeah did she appear in the enemy right (82:41 - 82:48)
did several times did she (82:45 - 82:51)
the thing was yeah well she had like a (82:48 - 82:53)
very like I'm like outer space see (82:51 - 82:58)
otherworldly over a kind of voice but (82:53 - 83:00)
the main thing in the anime was she had (82:58 - 83:05)
one vision of ash greninja and then she (83:00 - 83:06)
also had a vision about what was going (83:05 - 83:11)
to happen with zygarde but also what was (83:06 - 83:14)
cool was because the mega evolution (83:11 - 83:17)
specials were simultaneous to that (83:14 - 83:20)
season of the X&Y anime she had a vision (83:17 - 83:26)
about Groudon and Kyogre and she told (83:20 - 83:28)
Kalos they gave them the information so (83:26 - 83:29)
that they could protect themselves from (83:28 - 83:31)
that a particular event as it was (83:29 - 83:35)
occurring so there you go apparently she (83:31 - 83:39)
speaks almost entirely in haiku yeah in (83:35 - 83:41)
Japanese does she not do that in the (83:39 - 83:43)
English Channel (83:41 - 83:46)
it's harder to make haiku in English (83:43 - 83:49)
so no in the game not not in the anime (83:46 - 83:52)
the anime she just spoke oh okay getting (83:49 - 83:54)
the dress in haiku her what would her (83:52 - 83:56)
band poke my master's thing be meowstic (83:54 - 84:00)
right yeah yeah (83:56 - 84:00)

happens to be easier than you I guess I (88:21 - 88:26)
will keep uploading until either no one (88:22 - 88:28)
is listening anymore or it becomes a (88:26 - 88:29)
hassle I don't know it seems to be doing (88:28 - 88:31)
okay we uploaded episodes before I need (88:29 - 88:33)

cast but you know some people want extra (88:51 - 88:55)
content but they also don't want to sit (88:54 - 88:58)
through a 6 hour stream so I'm gonna try (88:55 - 89:00)
to start highlighting some of the funny (88:58 - 89:02)
or educational or best content from the (89:00 - 89:05)
streams and moving it over to YouTube so (89:02 - 89:09)
even educational quoting so hard for (89:05 - 89:12)
