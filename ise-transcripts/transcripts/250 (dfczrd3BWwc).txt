non-twitch watchers (2:13 - 2:18)
we are doing this live on twitch (2:16 - 2:22)
and yeah that's those are words i'm (2:18 - 2:23)

i'm gonna switch back here okay i'm your (2:47 - 2:52)
host sbj this is (2:49 - 2:54)
the pokemon podcast it's super effective (2:52 - 2:57)
and to my left on the stream i have (2:54 - 2:59)
travis (2:57 - 3:02)
it was a flip of the coin for me to know (2:59 - 3:03)
if that was actually going to be me or (3:02 - 3:04)
will because i have no idea where i am (3:03 - 3:06)
in the stream i (3:04 - 3:09)
decided that because we were we hit 250 (3:06 - 3:11)
episodes i i was sort of in a (3:09 - 3:14)
nostalgic mood so i went to see how long (3:11 - 3:16)
ago it was that i (3:14 - 3:17)
joined this show (3:16 - 3:19)
and it was (3:17 - 3:21)
almost in a month it will be six years (3:19 - 3:22)
ago (3:21 - 3:23)
and (3:22 - 3:26)
that is because because i'm 24 years old (3:23 - 3:28)
that's quite literally a quarter of my (3:26 - 3:31)
life how weird is that (3:28 - 3:31)
that is weird (3:31 - 3:35)
baby baby this special episode we will (3:33 - 3:38)
read travis's original email no i'm just (3:35 - 3:40)
kidding (3:38 - 3:40)
the fans have been waiting for it (3:40 - 3:44)
i heard my mouth and i have been (3:43 - 3:46)
dreading it i heard my mouth was not (3:44 - 3:48)
synced to my (3:46 - 3:50)
vocals so i (3:48 - 3:52)
hopefully fix that now (3:50 - 3:55)
to my right i have will (3:52 - 3:55)
so i had two things to say one i was (3:56 - 4:00)
concerned that people might think that i (3:58 - 4:02)
have given up on diet and exercise just (4:00 - 4:03)
because i don't talk about marathon (4:02 - 4:05)
training all the time but that's (4:03 - 4:07)
incorrect i still go to the gym six (4:05 - 4:09)
times a week and i've just been doing a (4:07 - 4:10)
lifting program (4:09 - 4:12)
and the other was i was considering (4:10 - 4:14)
replacing instead of having my face on (4:12 - 4:17)
the video putting up a vanguard card and (4:14 - 4:20)
just having that be me for the whole (4:17 - 4:21)
show (4:20 - 4:24)
but i decided not to do that (4:21 - 4:24)
it's a bummer it sounded like a (4:24 - 4:28)
brilliant idea (4:25 - 4:30)
isn't that something from infinite jest (4:28 - 4:32)
or some other david foster wallace thing (4:30 - 4:36)
where in the future there there's (4:32 - 4:36)
camera there's like video calls but (4:36 - 4:40)
everyone just starts putting up (4:38 - 4:41)
little pictures instead because they (4:40 - 4:44)
don't want to be seen isn't that a (4:41 - 4:45)
thing i think it is i think it's an (4:44 - 4:48)
infinite chest from one of his other (4:45 - 4:49)
writings infinite jess was very about (4:48 - 4:53)
like the 80s 90s (4:49 - 4:53)
okay (4:53 - 4:58)
some some other story by the former (4:55 - 5:01)
david foster wallace (4:58 - 5:01)
sorry well now we have that settled the (5:03 - 5:08)
glad that's packed up that's in the bag (5:06 - 5:09)
um (5:08 - 5:11)
what do we have for you guys i should i (5:09 - 5:13)
should lay out the show shouldn't i (5:11 - 5:15)
uh so we're gonna do our off topic thing (5:13 - 5:17)
like we normally do and then we are (5:15 - 5:21)
going to tackle some pokemon news and (5:17 - 5:23)
then after that we have our main topic (5:21 - 5:26)
which i'm not sure uh what that'll be (5:23 - 5:28)
quite yet (5:26 - 5:28)
episode 250 yay (5:29 - 5:35)
250 episodes and then uh we are going to (5:32 - 5:38)
do pokemon of the week but before we get (5:35 - 5:40)
to pokemon of the week uh we're gonna (5:38 - 5:42)
answer some questions in the twitch chat (5:40 - 5:44)
uh whether that's pokemon or non-pokemon (5:42 - 5:46)
related we'll go ahead and do that as (5:44 - 5:47)
well (5:46 - 5:49)
and i heard my (5:47 - 5:52)
voice slash video is still off so i'm (5:49 - 5:54)
going to try to adjust that and (5:52 - 5:56)
uh if you are watching you can use the (5:54 - 5:59)
hashtag pcamencast for it to appear on (5:56 - 6:02)
the stream below travis (5:59 - 6:03)
that's a thing it kind of works it kind (6:02 - 6:05)
of doesn't (6:03 - 6:07)
and (6:05 - 6:10)
yeah so we'll do that and (6:07 - 6:13)
i will continue to monitor chat and (6:10 - 6:16)
adjust any audio from there on out (6:13 - 6:18)
and yeah so before we do (6:16 - 6:20)
news (6:18 - 6:22)
will how was your week (6:20 - 6:23)
i mean it was great but i just had this (6:22 - 6:25)
amazing realization (6:23 - 6:27)
you got a this is fine dog too (6:25 - 6:28)
[Music] (6:27 - 6:31)
yeah i do can you see it i don't i can (6:28 - 6:33)
see it right over your shoulder tell you (6:31 - 6:35)
tell them about the fi this is fine dog (6:33 - 6:37)
i will go get the this is fine dog (6:35 - 6:38)
because they can't see it on stream (6:37 - 6:39)
because it's cut (6:38 - 6:40)
oh (6:39 - 6:43)
all right well yeah this is fine dog (6:40 - 6:45)
comes from and if you actually do just a (6:43 - 6:47)
web search on know your meme for this is (6:45 - 6:50)
fine dog you'll actually see the (6:47 - 6:52)
original comic strip and it's a little (6:50 - 6:54)
dog sitting in a burning house and you (6:52 - 6:56)
see all the flames around and the dog (6:54 - 6:59)
says uh this is fine i am okay with (6:56 - 7:01)
what's happening right now everything (6:59 - 7:03)
will be all right and he just continues (7:01 - 7:05)
sipping his coffee until (7:03 - 7:07)
you know the inevitable consequence of (7:05 - 7:09)
being in a burning house (7:07 - 7:10)
occurs (7:09 - 7:11)
um but the (7:10 - 7:13)
artist's original artist wasn't making (7:11 - 7:15)
any money off that very popular internet (7:13 - 7:18)
meme of this is fine dog so (7:15 - 7:20)
worked with someone to make a (7:18 - 7:22)
plush stuffed this is fine dog on (7:20 - 7:23)
kickstarter (7:22 - 7:26)
and it turns out we both bought one and (7:23 - 7:28)
i keep one in my office because that is (7:26 - 7:30)
the most accurate description of my work (7:28 - 7:31)
life (7:30 - 7:33)
um the building burning down around us (7:31 - 7:36)
and everyone's enjoying their coffee (7:33 - 7:37)
yeah i (7:36 - 7:40)
first off one of the best kickstarters i (7:37 - 7:42)
think i've ever backed (7:40 - 7:45)
secondly it shipped really really fast (7:42 - 7:46)
and thirdly (7:45 - 7:47)
uh third (7:46 - 7:50)
bonus stickers i got the bonus stickers (7:47 - 7:53)
uh this plush is really big (7:50 - 7:55)
it's really big and it's really soft (7:53 - 7:59)
it's really really soft soft very soft (7:55 - 8:00)
yeah if you look on my instagram you can (7:59 - 8:03)
get a sense of how large it is uh versus (8:00 - 8:06)
eight and a half uh by 11 or (8:03 - 8:08)
yeah eight and a half by 11 paper (8:06 - 8:09)
because there's a lot of that all over (8:08 - 8:11)
my desk i mean people tell me all the (8:09 - 8:15)
times uh steve you have a small head (8:11 - 8:18)
no one has ever said that to me but uh (8:15 - 8:20)
this is the head to (8:18 - 8:23)
plush dog ratio right here how many cats (8:20 - 8:25)
how many cats (8:23 - 8:27)
i would say that this is fine dog is (8:25 - 8:29)
probably one cat big (8:27 - 8:31)
i'd say maybe even (8:29 - 8:33)
i i was gonna say like one and a quarter (8:31 - 8:36)
i have been i have big cats at my house (8:33 - 8:38)
so (8:36 - 8:40)
your cats are about half the size of my (8:38 - 8:41)
cat (8:40 - 8:42)
oh (8:41 - 8:44)
so yeah (8:42 - 8:45)
and that thing is huge (8:44 - 8:47)
that's not a real cat (8:45 - 8:50)
um what what maine coons are real (8:47 - 8:52)
they're like of a different species or (8:50 - 8:55)
something of cat oh my god we said cat (8:52 - 8:57)
and now my cat's coming over here and he (8:55 - 9:00)
like bites (8:57 - 9:00)
we may have to break this up in a minute (9:02 - 9:07)
oh why did we say cat so many times i (9:04 - 9:09)
went to island games yesterday and i (9:07 - 9:12)
actually got to play uh games with uh (9:09 - 9:14)
podcast celebrity gin (9:12 - 9:17)
um who met up with me and one of our (9:14 - 9:18)
listeners lindsay who's in our slack (9:17 - 9:20)
community (9:18 - 9:23)
and we played (9:20 - 9:23)
and it took us like four hours to play (9:24 - 9:27)
two games but we still had like tons of (9:25 - 9:29)
fun for people that didn't understand (9:27 - 9:32)
what you just said what is that that's (9:29 - 9:34)
vanguard right nope (9:32 - 9:36)
consume a goddess is a deck building (9:34 - 9:37)
game (9:36 - 9:39)
and you play it's basically you (9:37 - 9:41)
typically play as norse gods versus (9:39 - 9:43)
greek gods (9:41 - 9:44)
and (9:43 - 9:47)
you build your deck by getting followers (9:44 - 9:49)
in faith points and you use those to buy (9:47 - 9:51)
warriors and then you use the warriors (9:49 - 9:54)
to attack the other gods you try to get (9:51 - 9:56)
the main opponent god's life force down (9:54 - 9:58)
to zero (9:56 - 9:59)
it's a lot of fun (9:58 - 10:01)
all right all right like deck building (9:59 - 10:02)
like dominion (10:01 - 10:06)
it's like dominion but with a lot more (10:02 - 10:10)
interaction where you're harming your (10:06 - 10:12)
opponents or if you're on a god team (10:10 - 10:16)
then with uh you aid your your co-god so (10:12 - 10:18)
like the main god starts with 20 life (10:16 - 10:20)
points and the support gods all start (10:18 - 10:22)
with 10 life points and (10:20 - 10:24)
when you play team play no god can (10:22 - 10:25)
actually die (10:24 - 10:27)
um except for the main god because once (10:25 - 10:29)
the main god hits zero or that team (10:27 - 10:30)
loses so if you're playing the support (10:29 - 10:32)
guard you like play super reckless (10:30 - 10:33)
because you don't care if your life (10:32 - 10:35)
points get down to zero because you (10:33 - 10:37)
can't die that just knocks you out for (10:35 - 10:39)
five turns (10:37 - 10:41)
so it's it's you we gotta play it (10:39 - 10:42)
sometime when you come back we'll play (10:41 - 10:44)
it i like playing games games are my (10:42 - 10:46)
thing travis what's new with you give me (10:44 - 10:47)
the (10:46 - 10:50)
load give me the t down the travis down (10:47 - 10:53)
okay sure i guess we'll do because i (10:50 - 10:54)
can't think of anything else to talk (10:53 - 10:56)
about i guess we'll do an (10:54 - 10:58)
immigration update i think i think the (10:56 - 11:01)
fans are liking those (10:58 - 11:01)
these days it might be easier to get (11:04 - 11:09)
deported i don't think that that joke is (11:06 - 11:11)
funny (11:09 - 11:14)
i'm laughing nervously but (11:11 - 11:16)
for the record i don't think that that (11:14 - 11:18)
is a funny joke i (11:16 - 11:19)
am (11:18 - 11:22)
so i'm still at the stage where i am (11:19 - 11:25)
having my education assessed as i was (11:22 - 11:26)
the other week (11:25 - 11:27)
but (11:26 - 11:31)
now i got confirmation that (11:27 - 11:33)
they've started (11:31 - 11:35)
which i thought they had (11:33 - 11:37)
ages ago (11:35 - 11:40)
because i had sent my all my documents (11:37 - 11:42)
up to (11:40 - 11:45)
some place called guelph ontario to a (11:42 - 11:48)
third party that that (11:45 - 11:51)
g-u-e-l-p-h (11:48 - 11:51)
ontario which i assume is pronounced (11:51 - 11:55)
guelph which is where a third-party (11:53 - 11:56)
organization (11:55 - 11:59)
operates that then assesses people's (11:56 - 12:01)
education (11:59 - 12:03)
educational credation for the government (12:01 - 12:04)
of canada and (12:03 - 12:06)
[Music] (12:04 - 12:07)
i sent my (12:06 - 12:09)
forms ages ago but i just got a (12:07 - 12:11)
notification that says we have confirmed (12:09 - 12:14)
that the things you sent us ages ago are (12:11 - 12:16)
indeed the things you should have sent (12:14 - 12:16)
us (12:16 - 12:19)
now we'll start assessing them so (12:16 - 12:21)
one step closer (12:19 - 12:23)
one step closer to the edge and i'm (12:21 - 12:25)
about to break (12:23 - 12:26)
oh (12:25 - 12:28)
that's a joke it's like a song they're (12:26 - 12:31)
song lyrics no oh i know a bad song and (12:28 - 12:33)
that's the joke yep (12:31 - 12:35)
totally (12:33 - 12:38)
steve knows bad music (12:35 - 12:40)
no that's true (12:38 - 12:41)
although i've been listening to a lot of (12:40 - 12:43)
john billion lately so i have nothing to (12:41 - 12:44)
brag about (12:43 - 12:46)
all right (12:44 - 12:47)
i got (12:46 - 12:49)
dang i got nothing new to report (12:47 - 12:51)
that's all i mean i can (12:49 - 12:53)
tell you that i'm still playing final (12:51 - 12:56)
fantasy 14. that's still a thing still (12:53 - 12:58)
good uh i was up at one o'clock in the (12:56 - 13:00)
morning last night and steve was playing (12:58 - 13:03)
final fantasy 14. i i wasn't because my (13:00 - 13:05)
internet was broken and so i was i could (13:03 - 13:07)
at least like log into the game i (13:05 - 13:08)
couldn't really do anything hopefully my (13:07 - 13:10)
internet doesn't break during the stream (13:08 - 13:13)
but irena and i did get engaged in final (13:10 - 13:17)
fantasy 14 and we do plan on having a (13:13 - 13:19)
virtual wedding not to be confused that (13:17 - 13:21)
we are not engaged in real life i want (13:19 - 13:22)
to make that clear (13:21 - 13:25)
very clear very clear (13:22 - 13:27)
very clear we are we are just uh a (13:25 - 13:30)
couple in real life but in a video game (13:27 - 13:35)
we are we are tying the not uh crossing (13:30 - 13:38)
the the the cross (13:35 - 13:40)
twist (13:38 - 13:41)
she um (13:40 - 13:42)
she's the one who proposed is that (13:41 - 13:46)
correct yeah she uh said since one day i (13:42 - 13:49)
i may or may not propose to her in real (13:46 - 13:52)
life that she wanted to (13:49 - 13:54)
uh do she wanted to be the one that (13:52 - 13:57)
proposed in-game so she (13:54 - 13:59)
spent two hours in final fantasy finding (13:57 - 14:01)
the right location (13:59 - 14:03)
and then (14:01 - 14:05)
told me to follow her and then she got (14:03 - 14:07)
on her unicorn and i have a better (14:05 - 14:09)
unicorn uh it's a more rare unicorn (14:07 - 14:11)
that's why it's better (14:09 - 14:15)
and so i followed is that relevant (14:11 - 14:16)
sorry i need to turn my game down but (14:15 - 14:18)
that's really funny (14:16 - 14:21)
uh so i we we unicorned off to the said (14:18 - 14:25)
spot and uh then she proposed and uh (14:21 - 14:27)
yeah so uh now i have a quest in the (14:25 - 14:29)
game to make a ring and do all that so (14:27 - 14:30)

free to (14:43 - 14:45)
the people need some real answers here (14:49 - 14:54)
because there's a big controversy (14:52 - 14:57)
controversy about this engagement (14:54 - 14:59)
did you (14:57 - 15:01)
change your species (14:59 - 15:04)
in order to get engaged (15:01 - 15:09)
shame on you sir i did and so i was (15:04 - 15:12)
i was a lalafell in final fantasy which (15:09 - 15:13)
is this (15:12 - 15:15)
short (15:13 - 15:16)
what (15:15 - 15:18)
travis what is the pg (15:16 - 15:19)
they look like little kids i don't know (15:18 - 15:21)
what the pg term of it i don't want to (15:19 - 15:24)
offend anyone uh but they look like kids (15:21 - 15:25)
they're magical (15:24 - 15:26)
creatures (15:25 - 15:29)
like like hobbits sort of that yeah like (15:26 - 15:31)
sort of elvish looking (15:29 - 15:32)
more (15:31 - 15:35)
more elvish looking halflings i guess (15:32 - 15:36)
would be the fantasy term (15:35 - 15:40)
um so i i was a lava fell she was the i (15:36 - 15:43)
think a high elf or or whatever but her (15:40 - 15:45)
her character who i helped make looks (15:43 - 15:47)
looks very much like her and my (15:45 - 15:48)
character not so much and one of the (15:47 - 15:51)
reasons i went with the lalafell uh and (15:48 - 15:52)
then after after the story we'll get to (15:51 - 15:54)
pokemon news for those just joining us (15:52 - 15:57)
uh so after (15:54 - 15:57)
so the reason i went with the lalafell (15:57 - 16:02)
mostly is because i didn't think (15:59 - 16:04)
any of the other races whether that's (16:02 - 16:07)
highlander or high elf or (16:04 - 16:10)
uh lizard guy (16:07 - 16:11)
or big (16:10 - 16:13)
uh fantastic four guy i didn't think any (16:11 - 16:16)
of them looked good and the beard slash (16:13 - 16:18)
five o'clock shadow slash hair options (16:16 - 16:20)
were not up to my liking (16:18 - 16:23)
so in in most create characters i either (16:20 - 16:25)
want to look as closely to me as (16:23 - 16:27)
possible or just not me at all and go (16:25 - 16:28)
with something completely different like (16:27 - 16:30)
a lalafell so i went with the lalafell (16:28 - 16:32)
because i wasn't satisfied with the uh (16:30 - 16:34)
white person customization controls that (16:32 - 16:36)
they offered (16:34 - 16:36)
me (16:36 - 16:38)
and (16:36 - 16:40)
irene was not having that she did not (16:38 - 16:43)
want to marry somebody who looked like a (16:40 - 16:44)
child (16:43 - 16:48)
when her character looked so accurate to (16:44 - 16:50)
what she looks like in real life (16:48 - 16:52)
so she said we couldn't get married (16:50 - 16:53)
unless i (16:52 - 16:55)
changed my appearance which cost 10 (16:53 - 16:58)
dollars by the way (16:55 - 17:01)
to something that looked more like me (16:58 - 17:04)
and i was very against that and you (17:01 - 17:06)
shouldn't have blown all your cash on (17:04 - 17:08)
that better unicorn (17:06 - 17:10)
yeah no no that was that was a drop in a (17:08 - 17:14)
very hard dungeon but um time is money (17:10 - 17:16)
steve shouldn't have spent that time (17:14 - 17:18)
should have instead gotten ten dollars (17:16 - 17:22)
during that time yes uh that's true so (17:18 - 17:23)
uh i was very against changing my (17:22 - 17:25)
appearance because i liked the way my (17:23 - 17:27)
lalafell looked and (17:25 - 17:29)
she was very against marrying a somebody (17:27 - 17:31)
who looked like a kid (17:29 - 17:33)
even though (17:31 - 17:34)
the benefits to marriage are pretty (17:33 - 17:36)
great like you can instantly teleport to (17:34 - 17:39)
your married partner which is such a (17:36 - 17:41)
huge like fantastic bonus you get this (17:39 - 17:43)
like giant chocobo that both of you can (17:41 - 17:46)
ride um you get a couple other things (17:43 - 17:47)
but there's so it's almost like real (17:46 - 17:49)
life where being able to marry someone (17:47 - 17:51)
gives you economic advantages over (17:49 - 17:53)
people who are not legally allowed to (17:51 - 17:54)
marry (17:53 - 17:56)
exactly exactly final fantasy marriages (17:54 - 17:59)
are very accurate um (17:56 - 18:01)
so finally i said (17:59 - 18:02)
that (18:01 - 18:05)
finally i was just like okay i will (18:02 - 18:08)
change my appearance but with the uh (18:05 - 18:09)
with the stipulation that as soon as (18:08 - 18:12)
this wedding is done and over changing (18:09 - 18:14)
back to a lalafell (18:12 - 18:16)
for another ten dollars (18:14 - 18:18)
yeah for another ten dollars i had one i (18:16 - 18:21)
had one free fantasia so this whole (18:18 - 18:23)
marriage besides the twenty dollars it (18:21 - 18:25)
costs to get married in the game which (18:23 - 18:26)
is probably cheaper than going to a (18:25 - 18:27)
courthouse and getting married in real (18:26 - 18:30)
life um (18:27 - 18:30)
maryland for free (18:31 - 18:35)
well besides the (18:33 - 18:36)
legal things that you have to do but (18:35 - 18:38)
otherwise (18:36 - 18:40)
yes i could perform the ceremony for you (18:38 - 18:42)
you spent almost the price tag of a (18:40 - 18:44)
full-priced (18:42 - 18:46)
video game well whatever do your thing (18:44 - 18:49)
whatever (18:46 - 18:49)
hey it's you know baby steps travis some (18:50 - 18:55)
of us need need a virtual wedding before (18:53 - 18:57)
we commit to the real wedding does (18:55 - 18:59)
babies what does okay that's what baby (18:57 - 19:03)
steps means in this context yeah yeah (18:59 - 19:04)
okay (19:03 - 19:06)
all right let's get into some pokemon (19:04 - 19:07)
news (19:06 - 19:09)
that was probably the best final fan if (19:07 - 19:10)
that story alone doesn't convince you to (19:09 - 19:12)
get final fantasy 14 to attend my (19:10 - 19:14)
virtual wedding i don't know what else (19:12 - 19:15)
well (19:14 - 19:17)
all right pokemon news (19:15 - 19:20)
first bit of news here is pokemon duel (19:17 - 19:22)
released internationally on ios and (19:20 - 19:26)
android the previous japanese exclusive (19:22 - 19:28)
freemium mobile game which was called (19:26 - 19:31)
pokemon co-master has been released (19:28 - 19:34)
under the new name pokemon duel it is a (19:31 - 19:36)
board game like game of strategy and (19:34 - 19:39)
tactics using pokemon figures players (19:36 - 19:42)
collect and build their own deck from a (19:39 - 19:43)
large range of figures and with (19:42 - 19:46)
different characteristics (19:43 - 19:48)
each player will move figures aiming to (19:46 - 19:49)
reach their opponent's goal first (19:48 - 19:53)
pokemon duel allows both online and (19:49 - 19:55)
local multiplayer the game plays very (19:53 - 19:58)
similarly to the pokemon trading figure (19:55 - 19:59)
game (19:58 - 20:02)
and this game is available in a range of (19:59 - 20:05)
countries and it was released on both (20:02 - 20:08)
ios and google play (20:05 - 20:11)
and uh yeah i have downloaded the game (20:08 - 20:14)
i have not played the game (20:11 - 20:15)
but i (20:14 - 20:16)
do know (20:15 - 20:21)
that it sounds like it's broken (20:16 - 20:23)
but travis played (20:21 - 20:26)
broken as in it it's very slow (20:23 - 20:28)
uh i heard there was audio issues i (20:26 - 20:30)
heard that it has been crashing i heard (20:28 - 20:34)
this both across uh android and ios um i (20:30 - 20:37)
have an ios device but like i said i've (20:34 - 20:39)
only installed it i have not played it i (20:37 - 20:41)
believe before we started travis said (20:39 - 20:42)
that (20:41 - 20:44)
that they (20:42 - 20:47)
went ahead and installed it and tried it (20:44 - 20:49)
yeah i've played through the tutorial uh (20:47 - 20:52)
which i realize isn't a lot but (20:49 - 20:54)
a decent enough junk that i can tell you (20:52 - 20:56)
what how the game plays you're right (20:54 - 20:58)
that it is operating a little slowly the (20:56 - 20:59)
thing that (20:58 - 21:01)
frustrated me when it originally came (20:59 - 21:03)
out and prevented me from (21:01 - 21:06)
getting more of an idea is that similar (21:03 - 21:10)
to the recently released mario run game (21:06 - 21:11)
that nintendo put out the first time you (21:10 - 21:14)
play it it basically has to download the (21:11 - 21:16)
game after the app installs and so (21:14 - 21:17)
you're on just like a splash screen (21:16 - 21:21)
waiting for the data to download (21:17 - 21:23)
and (21:21 - 21:25)
with pokemon dual (21:23 - 21:27)
that meant (21:25 - 21:29)
that i couldn't turn the sound off (21:27 - 21:30)
because i couldn't (21:29 - 21:32)
the game hadn't loaded yet for me to (21:30 - 21:34)
then go into the options and turn off (21:32 - 21:36)
the music so i was listening to a (21:34 - 21:38)
podcast at that time so (21:36 - 21:39)
i (21:38 - 21:40)
wanted to listen to the podcast more (21:39 - 21:42)
than i wanted to wait the amount of time (21:40 - 21:43)
for the game to install so i didn't get (21:42 - 21:44)
as much of a chance to play it as i (21:43 - 21:46)
wanted you're right that it's a little (21:44 - 21:47)
slow (21:46 - 21:48)
i would say that (21:47 - 21:50)
the before i get into the rules of the (21:48 - 21:52)
game the ui is very similar to i don't (21:50 - 21:54)
know if they've changed it since then (21:52 - 21:56)
but when (21:54 - 21:58)
what is it pt (21:56 - 21:59)
c (21:58 - 22:02)
g the the pokemon trading card game (21:59 - 22:05)
online whatever that acronym is ptc (22:02 - 22:05)
oh (22:05 - 22:07)
yeah but i (22:05 - 22:08)
a lot of i feel like it has a very (22:07 - 22:10)
similar (22:08 - 22:12)
uh user interface to that which i didn't (22:10 - 22:15)
really like the interface of ptcgo it's (22:12 - 22:16)
kind of (22:15 - 22:18)
strange uh (22:16 - 22:21)
and it's similar on pokemon duel (22:18 - 22:23)
the rule set (22:21 - 22:24)
is pretty simple (22:23 - 22:27)
you play on this little grid (22:24 - 22:29)
and you have these figures and each of (22:27 - 22:31)
them has a (22:29 - 22:33)
speed or i guess it's called them they (22:31 - 22:35)
have movement points and you can move (22:33 - 22:37)
your figures on to different points in (22:35 - 22:39)
the grid and your goal is to place one (22:37 - 22:42)
of your figures all of which are pokemon (22:39 - 22:45)
onto your opponent's goal space so you (22:42 - 22:47)
sort of advance your figures and try to (22:45 - 22:51)
take the opponent's base essentially and (22:47 - 22:52)
if you run into another pokemon you (22:51 - 22:55)
can't just walk through an enemy pokemon (22:52 - 22:56)
you have to battle them to be able to do (22:55 - 22:59)
that battles are resolved basically (22:56 - 23:01)
randomly you there's a dial that gets (22:59 - 23:04)
spun uh of the basically of your (23:01 - 23:06)
pokemon's moveset (23:04 - 23:08)
there's a chance your pokemon can miss (23:06 - 23:10)
chance your pokemon can dodge a chance (23:08 - 23:13)
your pokemon can use a move (23:10 - 23:15)
if your pokemon uses a move (23:13 - 23:17)
the move that (23:15 - 23:19)
does more damage (23:17 - 23:21)
defeats the other (23:19 - 23:23)
pokemon um and there are also rules (23:21 - 23:25)
about like moves that are purple and (23:23 - 23:26)
moves that are gold that might take (23:25 - 23:28)
precedence over each other but i don't (23:26 - 23:29)
really need to go into that it's (23:28 - 23:31)
basically maneuvering (23:29 - 23:33)
units to try and take your opponent's (23:31 - 23:35)
base (23:33 - 23:37)
it seems pretty (23:35 - 23:39)
simple like there's not a lot of depth (23:37 - 23:43)
into it i think the most is trying to (23:39 - 23:44)
come up with (23:43 - 23:47)
a squad of pokemon that (23:44 - 23:49)
have moves that you can rely on but like (23:47 - 23:50)
i said i only played through the (23:49 - 23:52)
tutorial so i don't know all the depth (23:50 - 23:54)
but it seems like a pretty basic (23:52 - 23:56)
game it it what it was (23:54 - 23:58)
i don't know i think i might play it a (23:56 - 24:00)
little more especially now that i'm past (23:58 - 24:04)
the tutorial and can play actual people (24:00 - 24:04)
will have you given this a shot yet (24:04 - 24:11)
nope because it got such bad reviews on (24:07 - 24:12)
the japanese version when it first came (24:11 - 24:15)
out i was like (24:12 - 24:17)
this isn't gonna hit one of my time few (24:15 - 24:20)
remaining time slots of when i can do (24:17 - 24:22)
things i i did you know like i have (24:20 - 24:24)
unlocked every region in pokemon pick (24:22 - 24:26)
ross and i have almost have crowned (24:24 - 24:29)
every level in pokemon pick ross so (24:26 - 24:31)
potentially in another month when i'm (24:29 - 24:33)
completely done with pokemon pick ross (24:31 - 24:36)
i'll have time for komistar or a co (24:33 - 24:37)
duel (24:36 - 24:39)
um duel (24:37 - 24:41)
i always thought the name pokemon coma (24:39 - 24:43)
star was like a reference to like that (24:41 - 24:46)
meme that ash is like in a coma and (24:43 - 24:48)
become a dream he never ages (24:46 - 24:51)
so it's like pokemon comas he's 11 now (24:48 - 24:54)
isn't he canonically eleven no i i only (24:51 - 24:56)
just saw the last episode of pokemon xyz (24:54 - 24:58)
and cried my (24:56 - 25:02)
eyes out yesterday (24:58 - 25:02)
i know it's supposed to be really good (25:03 - 25:06)
i'll start watching it soon but (25:04 - 25:08)
all the cartoons i watched yesterday (25:06 - 25:09)
made me cry which was just a horrible (25:08 - 25:12)
day for me but anyways yes um he may be (25:09 - 25:16)
11 who knows he lives in the lola now (25:12 - 25:19)
the theme is really good (25:16 - 25:20)
i don't think i've heard the american (25:19 - 25:23)
theme song yet because i've watched the (25:20 - 25:26)
i watched the two anime episodes (25:23 - 25:28)
prior to them being released like just (25:26 - 25:31)
youtube or some illegal stream of hey we (25:28 - 25:33)
here's the english versions and they did (25:31 - 25:36)
not have the intro included (25:33 - 25:37)
i think the first two episodes are on (25:36 - 25:39)
pokemon tv now (25:37 - 25:41)
oh okay (25:39 - 25:43)
uh yeah i was talking about the japanese (25:41 - 25:44)
version because i've been watching it (25:43 - 25:46)
subtitled (25:44 - 25:47)
uh okay i haven't heard the american (25:46 - 25:49)
theme song actually (25:47 - 25:51)
i would be curious of what that sounds (25:49 - 25:54)
like uh back to duel though i (25:51 - 25:56)
feel like this would be a game that i (25:54 - 25:59)
would enjoy and i haven't opened it (25:56 - 26:01)
because i did want to it was like i (25:59 - 26:03)
thought to myself this is something i (26:01 - 26:05)
could see myself streaming on like a (26:03 - 26:07)
friday night or just real quick in and (26:05 - 26:09)
out if i'm if i'm planning on playing it (26:07 - 26:11)
so i didn't want to start playing it (26:09 - 26:12)
without (26:11 - 26:16)
uh airing my grieving grievian (26:12 - 26:16)
airing my complaints let's say that word (26:16 - 26:21)
because i can say that easier (26:19 - 26:22)
on air (26:21 - 26:25)
and so i will i will wait for the first (26:22 - 26:29)
uh ios update and then if that happens (26:25 - 26:32)
uh i will stream that and go from there (26:29 - 26:33)
i guess (26:32 - 26:35)
so (26:33 - 26:37)
second bit of news here is (26:35 - 26:39)
probably what people were more excited (26:37 - 26:40)
for i don't know maybe people were very (26:39 - 26:42)
excited for pokemon duel but that was a (26:40 - 26:44)
little unexpected but people were (26:42 - 26:47)
expecting a pokemon bank update which (26:44 - 26:49)
did bring compatibility to pokemon sun (26:47 - 26:51)
and moon a new update for pokemon bank (26:49 - 26:54)
is available players will now be able to (26:51 - 26:56)
use pokemon bank to transfer pokemon (26:54 - 26:58)
from x and y and omega ruby and alpha (26:56 - 27:00)
sapphire to pokemon sun and moon players (26:58 - 27:02)
can use the pokey transporter to (27:00 - 27:04)
transfer pokemon from virtual console (27:02 - 27:06)
versions of pokemon red blue and yellow (27:04 - 27:08)
to pokemon sun and moon pokemon (27:06 - 27:10)

will have at least three perfect ivs and (27:10 - 27:17)
have their hidden ability (27:13 - 27:17)
muanium muneenium z will be distributed (27:17 - 27:23)

available till october 2nd (27:23 - 27:30)
2017. this muenium z allows mew to use (27:25 - 27:33)
the z move genesis supernova when held (27:30 - 27:38)
genesis supernova is exclusive to mu (27:33 - 27:38)
so there you go that's did you see the (27:40 - 27:44)
the stuff about (27:43 - 27:46)
did you see the stuff about the (27:44 - 27:48)
glitch that happens if you try to (27:46 - 27:51)
transfer a missingno up through pokemon (27:48 - 27:52)
bank through the (27:51 - 27:53)
um (27:52 - 27:55)
no but we can get to that in a second (27:53 - 27:56)
because i think i have a news article (27:55 - 27:57)
about that (27:56 - 27:59)
uh oh have you guys i was gonna say did (27:57 - 28:01)
you hear that the (27:59 - 28:03)
uh ones that you transport up get a (28:01 - 28:06)
different little symbol so that you know (28:03 - 28:08)
that they're transported up yeah have (28:06 - 28:10)
either of you (28:08 - 28:13)
dabbled in the new pokemon bank (28:10 - 28:15)
i never got pokemon bank to begin with (28:13 - 28:16)
what (28:15 - 28:18)
what (28:16 - 28:20)
i don't (28:18 - 28:22)
pokemon bank is everything i wanted in (28:20 - 28:25)
in pokemon (28:22 - 28:28)
travis is like living in 1999 (28:25 - 28:32)
still but in the distant future of the (28:28 - 28:33)
year (28:32 - 28:35)
1999 (28:33 - 28:38)
i am going to finish (28:35 - 28:39)
my (28:38 - 28:42)
regional pokedex on pokemon moon (28:39 - 28:44)
completely within pokemon moon before i (28:42 - 28:47)
attach it to pokemon bank (28:44 - 28:50)
man the see travis is travis actually (28:47 - 28:52)
lives by candlelight too that's why his (28:50 - 28:56)
his camera is (28:52 - 28:56)
he's actually in uh cloverfield uh (29:00 - 29:05)
what was that movie oh no why can't i (29:03 - 29:07)
never remember the name the sequel to (29:05 - 29:09)
cloverfield lane 10 clover (29:07 - 29:11)
field lane (29:09 - 29:13)
that's that's where he's living right (29:11 - 29:14)
now (29:13 - 29:15)
he's (29:14 - 29:16)
under (29:15 - 29:19)
700 feet of ground right now (29:16 - 29:21)
that's a really good movie it is out of (29:19 - 29:24)
nowhere uh it's really good until the (29:21 - 29:27)
last like half hour (29:24 - 29:29)
what that part (29:27 - 29:30)
okay (29:29 - 29:33)
this is not this is not pokemon bank (29:30 - 29:35)
update so we talk about that some other (29:33 - 29:39)
time i i did update my pokemon bank last (29:35 - 29:42)
night and i transferred all my (29:39 - 29:44)
omega ruby (29:42 - 29:46)
and (29:44 - 29:50)
x pokemon from bank to sun to sun and (29:46 - 29:52)
then transferred them all back (29:50 - 29:54)
and then realized that really didn't do (29:52 - 29:57)
anything i think it filled out like (29:54 - 29:59)
maybe 30 or 40 pokemon that was missing (29:57 - 30:00)
so (29:59 - 30:03)
the good news from what i've gathered (30:00 - 30:07)
from last night's pokemon bankscapade is (30:03 - 30:10)
that i only need a hundred and one more (30:07 - 30:13)
pokemon to complete my alolan pokedex (30:10 - 30:17)
which seems pretty doable now (30:13 - 30:19)
uh opposed to i think prior to that i (30:17 - 30:23)
needed like i needed around 140 so (30:19 - 30:24)
that's (30:23 - 30:26)
a little bit motivating (30:24 - 30:30)
in the slightest i suppose (30:26 - 30:31)
i thought though that i read and maybe i (30:30 - 30:32)
was wrong (30:31 - 30:35)
that (30:32 - 30:35)
once (30:37 - 30:41)
pokemon bank updated you wouldn't need (30:39 - 30:43)
to transfer pokemon to the game it would (30:41 - 30:45)
just automatically read what's in your (30:43 - 30:47)
bank and apply that (30:45 - 30:48)
yeah i had heard that there's like some (30:47 - 30:50)
sort of synchronization that goes on (30:48 - 30:52)
that automatically updates your in-game (30:50 - 30:54)
pokedex with all the ones from pokemon (30:52 - 30:56)
bank without you having to physically (30:54 - 30:58)
move them into the game and out of the (30:56 - 31:00)
game again so maybe maybe it did that (30:58 - 31:02)
right off the bat and me (31:00 - 31:05)
dragging 14 boxes to the game and then (31:02 - 31:06)
dragging them back was useless uh i'm (31:05 - 31:08)
not sure unnecessary (31:06 - 31:10)
um i'm just (31:08 - 31:12)
talking about what consumed about a half (31:10 - 31:14)
hour of my life last night (31:12 - 31:16)
but no i was very excited that the (31:14 - 31:18)
pokemon bank stuff worked (31:16 - 31:19)
and (31:18 - 31:20)
[Music] (31:19 - 31:23)
this leads into more pokemon bank news (31:20 - 31:26)
that pokemon bank's mew glitch ban (31:23 - 31:29)
cracked by pokemon sun and moon players (31:26 - 31:31)
it looks like (31:29 - 31:31)
so (31:31 - 31:34)
travis you said that (31:31 - 31:36)
something about missingno and mew do you (31:34 - 31:38)
want to explain that real quick before i (31:36 - 31:40)
read this article (31:38 - 31:41)
i don't know if i'll get all the details (31:40 - 31:43)
right but if memory serves from i (31:41 - 31:45)
probably saw the same article you did (31:43 - 31:47)
if you transfer (31:45 - 31:49)
[Music] (31:47 - 31:52)
missing no from the 3ds port (31:49 - 31:54)
of (31:52 - 31:56)
red and blue (31:54 - 31:57)
missing obviously being the glitch (31:56 - 32:00)
pokemon in red and blue (31:57 - 32:03)
the sun and moon won't know how to or (32:00 - 32:06)
pokemon bank rather won't know how to (32:03 - 32:09)
handle it so it'll briefly appear in the (32:06 - 32:11)
box and then (32:09 - 32:15)
disappear and that will cause the names (32:11 - 32:17)
of all the pokemon next to it to shift (32:15 - 32:19)
over one space because there was a (32:17 - 32:20)
pokemon that appeared there and then (32:19 - 32:22)
disappeared so like the pokemon to the (32:20 - 32:24)
right of where you put it will now be (32:22 - 32:26)
called missing no and then the one to (32:24 - 32:27)
the right of that will be called (32:26 - 32:29)
whatever the pokemon to the left of that (32:27 - 32:31)
was called and i don't the article i (32:29 - 32:33)
read wasn't very specific so i wasn't (32:31 - 32:35)
able to determine if that was permanent (32:33 - 32:37)
or just on that screen because i did not (32:35 - 32:40)
buy the 3ds ports but it was sort of (32:37 - 32:44)
funny to me that the (32:40 - 32:44)
they hadn't considered what would happen (32:44 - 32:48)
if you brought up missing now given that (32:46 - 32:50)
that is (32:48 - 32:52)
a glitch in pokemon that has such (32:50 - 32:54)
mythical like (32:52 - 32:56)
legendary status it's been around the (32:54 - 32:58)
block you wouldn't i think they oh (32:56 - 32:59)
people (32:58 - 33:00)
yeah right and they were like people are (32:59 - 33:02)
going to try to do this i wonder what (33:00 - 33:05)
will happen in our software if they do (33:02 - 33:08)
apparently they didn't do that (33:05 - 33:08)
do you think then this is me maybe (33:08 - 33:13)
getting ahead of myself but do you think (33:10 - 33:14)
that (33:13 - 33:17)
so we know virtual console is coming to (33:14 - 33:20)
the nintendo switch they said that (33:17 - 33:22)
because people asked hey if i already (33:20 - 33:24)
bought these virtual console games do (33:22 - 33:26)
you have to buy them again on switch (33:24 - 33:28)
like i had to do for weed to wii u even (33:26 - 33:30)
though they were discounted on wii u but (33:28 - 33:31)
i still think that was like a ripoff (33:30 - 33:32)
because i bought (33:31 - 33:34)
50 (33:32 - 33:36)
some games on wii (33:34 - 33:38)
expecting that these digital games that (33:36 - 33:39)
i purchased on wii would last forever (33:38 - 33:41)
but they didn't and (33:39 - 33:44)
so ever since i got burned with that i'm (33:41 - 33:47)
very hesitant to buy anything on virtual (33:44 - 33:49)
console (33:47 - 33:49)
and that's primarily why i didn't buy (33:49 - 33:54)
red blue or yellow (33:51 - 33:55)
with that being said (33:54 - 33:57)
if red (33:55 - 33:59)
blue and yellow come (33:57 - 34:00)
to switch (33:59 - 34:04)
and they're pokey bank compatible (34:00 - 34:05)
do you think (34:04 - 34:07)
that's a pot do you would you want to (34:05 - 34:08)
see that do you think that's a (34:07 - 34:09)
possibility i'm just kind of throwing (34:08 - 34:12)
that for open discussion (34:09 - 34:13)
well i think since that was a single (34:12 - 34:16)
screen game it'd be a perfect (34:13 - 34:20)
port you know very easy to port over (34:16 - 34:22)
but i think that they're going to keep (34:20 - 34:25)
the two lines with 3ds gradually dying (34:22 - 34:27)
out so switch in 3ds until they're ready (34:25 - 34:29)
to release the switch u (34:27 - 34:32)
which will replace everything (34:29 - 34:34)
switch u (34:32 - 34:37)
yes the old switch you uh i would just (34:34 - 34:40)
be really into (34:37 - 34:40)
if they it (34:41 - 34:44)
it's not that i would be really into (34:42 - 34:45)
playing pokemon red blue and yellow (34:44 - 34:47)
again i definitely want to go through (34:45 - 34:49)
those games again actually i would (34:47 - 34:51)
prefer if it was like i would prefer if (34:49 - 34:53)
it was fire red or leaf green (34:51 - 34:55)
but (34:53 - 34:55)
if they (34:56 - 35:00)
finally fixed this whole nintendo (34:58 - 35:01)
account issue (35:00 - 35:03)
and have everything somewhat (35:01 - 35:05)
synchronized and recorded and i'm not (35:03 - 35:08)
buying these games a hundred more times (35:05 - 35:11)
i would definitely be down to purchase (35:08 - 35:13)
and play that and (35:11 - 35:15)
have that stuff transferred up to bank (35:13 - 35:17)
because now that (35:15 - 35:19)
red blue and yellow work with bank that (35:17 - 35:22)
does that that in itself wants me like i (35:19 - 35:24)
do want to buy those games and play them (35:22 - 35:27)
now that they work with bank but (35:24 - 35:29)
i just know that the 3ds will eventually (35:27 - 35:32)
die off at six years old at this point (35:29 - 35:34)
most consoles (35:32 - 35:36)
make it to about eight years maybe (35:34 - 35:38)
you know if your playstation like nine (35:36 - 35:40)
years but (35:38 - 35:41)
i don't want to buy those games with a (35:40 - 35:43)
new console coming out with the (35:41 - 35:44)
possibility of that new console having (35:43 - 35:46)
virtual console games and more likely (35:44 - 35:48)
the possibility of me having to buy (35:46 - 35:50)
those games again because nintendo (35:48 - 35:53)
doesn't want to honor stuff you've (35:50 - 35:55)
purchased in the past apparently (35:53 - 35:58)
so so one question i have is so when i (35:55 - 36:00)
set up my wii u i transferred my wii (35:58 - 36:02)
into my wii u (36:00 - 36:04)
and the wii virtual console games that i (36:02 - 36:07)
had transferred in to you just have to (36:04 - 36:09)
go into the virtual wii console and then (36:07 - 36:13)
go into the virtual virtual console that (36:09 - 36:14)
that is like so bad (36:13 - 36:18)
no it is terrible because once (36:14 - 36:18)
once you on wii u once you go into wii (36:19 - 36:24)
virtual console (36:22 - 36:27)
it re it reboots the system into a wii (36:24 - 36:28)
mode (36:27 - 36:30)
so everything gets disconnected your (36:28 - 36:33)
friends list is gone your tablet doesn't (36:30 - 36:35)
work (36:33 - 36:38)
it is a terrible system just let me (36:35 - 36:39)
transfer the (36:38 - 36:42)
128 megabyte excite bike and i'm being (36:39 - 36:44)
generous i'm sure excitebike's like 14 (36:42 - 36:47)
megabytes just transfer that to the core (36:44 - 36:48)
system (36:47 - 36:50)
you're already emulating it why emulate (36:48 - 36:51)
an emulator to (36:50 - 36:53)
[Music] (36:51 - 36:55)
all right okay so can i tell you (36:53 - 36:56)
something that's completely true and (36:55 - 36:58)
real besides the fact that i always (36:56 - 36:59)
laugh whenever whenever one of steve's (36:58 - 37:01)
cats walks behind him um (36:59 - 37:04)
i i think cinna just wants ever the cats (37:01 - 37:05)
i (37:04 - 37:07)
was literally thinking this morning (37:05 - 37:08)
because i was listening to another (37:07 - 37:10)
podcast about (37:08 - 37:11)
uh (37:10 - 37:13)
star stuff that we won't name there are (37:11 - 37:15)
other podcasts yeah and this one's about (37:13 - 37:17)
outer space stuff but i'm not going to (37:15 - 37:19)
give them any listeners (37:17 - 37:21)
anyways i was thinking i want to set up (37:19 - 37:23)
a data center on the moon (37:21 - 37:27)
that hosts a vr like a virtual reality (37:23 - 37:29)
environment where people on the earth (37:27 - 37:33)
can go into their vr headsets and have a (37:29 - 37:35)
virtual experience of being on the moon (37:33 - 37:37)
but because the data center is actually (37:35 - 37:40)
on the moon their virtual environment is (37:37 - 37:41)
hosted on the moon so they're virtually (37:40 - 37:45)
on the moon on the moon (37:41 - 37:46)
do you understand what (37:45 - 37:47)
no (37:46 - 37:50)
that is like the greatest idea ever it (37:47 - 37:52)
seems like that would be pretty a pretty (37:50 - 37:54)
expensive setup just for the joke of (37:52 - 37:57)
saying and also our server is on the (37:54 - 38:00)
moon no that's not how we're selling it (37:57 - 38:03)
you are virtually on the moon (38:00 - 38:06)
on the moon i thought you were gonna say (38:03 - 38:08)
that (38:06 - 38:10)
you would set up some sort of virtual (38:08 - 38:11)
environment that's what i'm trying to (38:10 - 38:13)
say you're virtually on the moon on the (38:11 - 38:14)
moon (38:13 - 38:15)
i thought what you're gonna say was (38:14 - 38:17)
you're gonna set up some sort of like (38:15 - 38:19)
rover that could be controlled remotely (38:17 - 38:21)
and then have the people with their vr (38:19 - 38:23)
headsets actually control something that (38:21 - 38:24)
is on the moon but what's the point too (38:23 - 38:26)
much (38:24 - 38:27)
solar powered data center on the moon (38:26 - 38:29)
hosts a virtual environment where you're (38:27 - 38:30)
on the moon and you're virtually on the (38:29 - 38:33)
moon on the moon that's that's all it is (38:30 - 38:35)
kickstarter launches uh march 2nd (38:33 - 38:37)
2017. (38:35 - 38:39)
what about heli what about helium 3 (38:37 - 38:41)
powered data center (38:39 - 38:42)
because isn't there a lot of helium 3 on (38:41 - 38:43)
the moon (38:42 - 38:46)
possibly but solar power is abundant and (38:43 - 38:48)
easy to obtain (38:46 - 38:49)
okay (38:48 - 38:50)
all right (38:49 - 38:51)
so (38:50 - 38:54)
pokemon bank's mu glitch ban cracked by (38:51 - 38:56)
pokemon sun and moon players you can now (38:54 - 38:59)
get your illegal mew into the (38:56 - 39:03)
games before i read this article (38:59 - 39:03)
what (39:04 - 39:05)
i (39:04 - 39:08)
don't understand why (39:05 - 39:10)
i'm just so confused (39:08 - 39:14)
why there is this big hoopa (39:10 - 39:14)
it was a pun (39:19 - 39:22)
about illegal muse (39:23 - 39:30)
or muse not obtained in the right way (39:25 - 39:30)
pokemon gave us two opportunities in the (39:31 - 39:36)
last 12 months to get a legal mew very (39:33 - 39:38)
easily (39:36 - 39:40)
illegal (39:38 - 39:44)
a legal a legal mute a legal mew yeah (39:40 - 39:47)
three words illegal (39:44 - 39:49)
a you that is legal (39:47 - 39:52)
they gave us two opportunities for that (39:49 - 39:54)
do you want me to do you want to draw (39:52 - 39:55)
this out or do you want me to give you (39:54 - 39:57)
the easy fast explanation (39:55 - 39:59)
well let me read the article okay a (39:57 - 40:01)
compatibility update for pokemon bank (39:59 - 40:03)
the nintendo this is from polygon.com (40:01 - 40:06)
the nintendo 3d storage app has finally (40:03 - 40:08)
made software usable in pokemon sun and (40:06 - 40:10)
moon went live (40:08 - 40:12)
uh although pokemon bank users get a (40:10 - 40:13)
special item from you one of the rarest (40:12 - 40:16)
pokemon it is almost impossible to (40:13 - 40:18)
capture the creature through official (40:16 - 40:20)
methods instead players play the virtual (40:18 - 40:21)
console version of red blue and yellow (40:20 - 40:23)
use the glitch to get mew in their (40:21 - 40:25)
collections i believe that glitch is uh (40:23 - 40:26)
you know going to the truck looking (40:25 - 40:28)
under the truck (40:26 - 40:30)
uh i'm just kidding (40:28 - 40:33)
uh that's a joke about pokemon bank (40:30 - 40:35)
players won't allow (40:33 - 40:37)
players to move over a mew obtained (40:35 - 40:40)
through the glitch into sun and moon (40:37 - 40:42)
unless they use this extremely (40:40 - 40:44)
complex method (40:42 - 40:46)
reddit has come up with a step-by-step (40:44 - 40:48)
guide to do that (40:46 - 40:51)
once they go through everything (40:48 - 40:52)
they will be able to move their game boy (40:51 - 40:55)
game their game boy version to pokemon (40:52 - 40:57)
sun and moon because pretty much what (40:55 - 41:00)
happens is mew gets a new compatible id (40:57 - 41:02)
number which is what is preventing you (41:00 - 41:04)
from getting moved to the first place (41:02 - 41:08)
and then they go into sun and moon (41:04 - 41:10)
and this will this will also lead into (41:08 - 41:13)
our last article but (41:10 - 41:13)
there for my understanding there's no (41:14 - 41:17)
legal (41:16 - 41:20)
way to obtain you in red blue and yellow (41:17 - 41:22)
is that correct (41:20 - 41:24)
the virtual console versions yes (41:22 - 41:26)
correct (41:24 - 41:28)
the only legal way to get it (41:26 - 41:31)
back in (41:28 - 41:33)
1999 (41:31 - 41:37)
was by going to toys r us future (41:33 - 41:39)
toys r us distribution the toys r us (41:37 - 41:42)
distribution (41:39 - 41:44)
but there are multiple way not multiple (41:42 - 41:45)
there's (41:44 - 41:49)
two ways in red and blue to get (41:45 - 41:50)
mew (41:49 - 41:54)
both ways are considered illegal (41:50 - 41:54)
you have to like like do a memory (41:56 - 42:00)
overrun in part of the game like or (41:57 - 42:03)
something like that like force it to to (42:00 - 42:05)
to glitch itself out by trying to use up (42:03 - 42:07)
too many or overlapping memory spaces or (42:05 - 42:08)
something like that there's something (42:07 - 42:10)
about like starting a trainer battle and (42:08 - 42:15)
hitting start and flying away and (42:10 - 42:15)
i'm not about that (42:16 - 42:19)
so the reason why people would want to (42:17 - 42:21)
get this into bank i was wrong i did 15 (42:19 - 42:22)
seconds of research and realized i was (42:21 - 42:25)
wrong because i was going to say (42:22 - 42:27)
because the things that you bring into (42:25 - 42:30)
bank from the virtual console games uh (42:27 - 42:32)
automatically get the hidden ability but (42:30 - 42:35)
mew has no hidden ability (42:32 - 42:36)
so (42:35 - 42:38)
that just makes no sense you are correct (42:36 - 42:40)
when they had multiple opportunities to (42:38 - 42:43)
receive a legal mew (42:40 - 42:45)
from distributions there was no point in (42:43 - 42:46)
trying to get one from the virtual (42:45 - 42:48)
console game yeah it was it was it was (42:46 - 42:51)
february last year you could use xy (42:48 - 42:52)
omega ruby alpha sapphire you could get (42:51 - 42:55)
mu four times if you own the game (42:52 - 42:57)
if you own four versions of the game and (42:55 - 42:59)
then if you missed that like three (42:57 - 43:00)
months later they sent out an email (42:59 - 43:02)
saying hey if you missed me here's (43:00 - 43:05)
another code from you (43:02 - 43:05)
there's a lot of opportunities to get (43:06 - 43:09)
you (43:07 - 43:09)
but (43:10 - 43:12)
i yep (43:10 - 43:15)
i i got my i i have i think i have three (43:12 - 43:17)
muse from when i checked my pokemon bank (43:15 - 43:20)
and you mean mew3 is confirmed i got i (43:17 - 43:24)
got the mew3 and i got the munium z (43:20 - 43:27)
thing to do as well i actually got two (43:24 - 43:28)
more news articles here pokemon bank (43:27 - 43:30)
unlocks this strange cut scene in (43:28 - 43:32)
pokemon sun and moon (43:30 - 43:34)
uh i i have not seen this cutscene but (43:32 - 43:37)
uh hopefully this isn't spoilery pokemon (43:34 - 43:39)
bank is now compatible with sun and moon (43:37 - 43:40)
we already know that while the biggest (43:39 - 43:42)
selling point is the completely new (43:40 - 43:45)
expanded national poke pokedex the (43:42 - 43:47)
compatibility update also lets players (43:45 - 43:50)
encounter a curious new cut scene (43:47 - 43:52)
with the help of some transferred over (43:50 - 43:55)
old pokemon bringing over soul rock from (43:52 - 43:57)
poke to pokemon sun or lunatone to (43:55 - 44:00)
pokemon moon the pokemon omega ruby from (43:57 - 44:02)
pokemon omega ruby or alpha sapphire (44:00 - 44:04)
respectfully (44:02 - 44:06)
makes it possible to interact with a (44:04 - 44:08)
certain with a certain character in a (44:06 - 44:11)
particular way (44:08 - 44:14)
and i guess for spoiler purposes i won't (44:11 - 44:16)
go into what that is (44:14 - 44:18)
i will just let you know that if you (44:16 - 44:20)
have a (44:18 - 44:22)
lunatone or a (44:20 - 44:24)
soul rock from omega ruby and alpha (44:22 - 44:27)
sapphire go ahead and transfer that into (44:24 - 44:29)
pokemon sun and moon and if you want (44:27 - 44:30)
more details about that (44:29 - 44:34)
there are some threads to uh (44:30 - 44:35)
go ahead (44:34 - 44:36)
here i'll give you i'll give you a i'll (44:35 - 44:38)
give you a head start so you have to put (44:36 - 44:40)
those pokemon in your party (44:38 - 44:43)
and you have to fly to the runes of (44:40 - 44:47)
done abduct dance on ulaula island (44:43 - 44:49)
abundance (44:47 - 44:52)
abundance uh so those are the first two (44:49 - 44:56)
steps there you go will is losing it (44:52 - 44:56)
although i like the ruins of abu dance (44:57 - 45:02)
abu dhabi (45:00 - 45:03)
dance (45:02 - 45:06)
dun dance abu dance uh so those are the (45:03 - 45:08)
first two steps or three steps transfer (45:06 - 45:09)
your (45:08 - 45:12)
lunatone and your soul rock to pokemon (45:09 - 45:14)
sun and moon soul rock has to go to sun (45:12 - 45:16)
lunatone has to go to moon put them in (45:14 - 45:19)
your party fly to uh abu do dan dance (45:16 - 45:21)

uh final news article here this is like (45:53 - 45:57)
the longest news segment we've had in a (45:55 - 45:58)
while (45:57 - 46:01)
pokemon sun and moon cheaters banned (45:58 - 46:05)
from online services (46:01 - 46:08)
this article also from polygon polygon (46:05 - 46:10)
just uh reporting on all the pokemon (46:08 - 46:13)
news nearly 6 000 pokemon sun and moon (46:10 - 46:15)
players are banned from using the global (46:13 - 46:19)
link the game's main online feature an (46:15 - 46:20)
announcement on the japanese global link (46:19 - 46:23)
page the pokemon company confirmed that (46:20 - 46:27)
players with illegal save data have been (46:23 - 46:29)
barred from going online (46:27 - 46:32)
5954 players have been caught cheating (46:29 - 46:35)
thus far that typically means they've (46:32 - 46:37)
used hacks modifications and other means (46:35 - 46:40)
to alter items and trainer info or that (46:37 - 46:43)
they've used quote unquote illegal (46:40 - 46:46)
pokemon in online competition or trades (46:43 - 46:48)
it is unclear which particular cheats (46:46 - 46:50)
they are getting in trouble with the (46:48 - 46:52)
pokemon company however (46:50 - 46:55)
uh whoops i said that sentence weird and (46:52 - 46:57)
whether those uh who simply received (46:55 - 47:00)
hack pokemons unwitting uh are now (46:57 - 47:02)
facing the consequences too we've (47:00 - 47:03)
reached out for clarification on what (47:02 - 47:07)
gets players booted from global link i (47:03 - 47:09)
personally highly doubt pokemon company (47:07 - 47:10)
is going to tell you what actually gets (47:09 - 47:13)
you banned then people would work around (47:10 - 47:14)
that so (47:13 - 47:16)
the penalty for cheating is a permanent (47:14 - 47:17)
ban from participating in global (47:16 - 47:19)
missions yeah because those have been so (47:17 - 47:21)
great so far raiding battles and (47:19 - 47:24)
competitions effective players receive (47:21 - 47:26)
an error code when trying to connect (47:24 - 47:28)
to the internet (47:26 - 47:30)
uh and use these features the pokemon (47:28 - 47:32)
company also stated on global link site (47:30 - 47:34)
that it plans to keep an eye out for (47:32 - 47:36)
and ban additional cheaters in the (47:34 - 47:38)
future it is a reminder that the pokemon (47:36 - 47:41)
company does not go easy to those who (47:38 - 47:42)
tried to play sun and moon and other (47:41 - 47:45)
pokemon games in 2013 following the (47:42 - 47:48)
launch of pokemon x and x and y more (47:45 - 47:50)
than 1 500 players were banned from (47:48 - 47:52)
competing on online tournaments because (47:50 - 47:55)
they used hack pokemon (47:52 - 47:55)
and there you go 5000 isn't a lot so my (47:56 - 48:02)
inclination would be to think that (48:00 - 48:05)
it's not really something to because the (48:02 - 48:08)
article posed the question (48:05 - 48:09)
oh what if people (48:08 - 48:11)
ended up with (48:09 - 48:14)
act pokemon that they just traded from a (48:11 - 48:17)
friend or something given that (48:14 - 48:20)
5000 isn't a lot of people my guess (48:17 - 48:21)
would be (48:20 - 48:24)
it's a more obvious thing that they're (48:21 - 48:26)
banning although that's just an estimate (48:24 - 48:27)
but (48:26 - 48:28)
that would be my guess (48:27 - 48:30)
yeah so it's it is (48:28 - 48:34)
5954 people explicitly and if anybody (48:30 - 48:37)
wants to see like tpci's official word (48:34 - 48:38)
on this (48:37 - 48:39)
if you go to (48:38 - 48:41)
pokemon-gl.com they actually have in (48:39 - 48:44)
their news section an announcement about (48:41 - 48:45)
this (48:44 - 48:47)
and the language that they specifically (48:45 - 48:50)
use is (48:47 - 48:50)
engaged in unauthorized modification of (48:50 - 48:55)
their game data (48:53 - 48:58)
so i think they probably have a way of (48:55 - 49:00)
telling if somebody game sharked or (48:58 - 49:02)
otherwise modified their own game (49:00 - 49:05)
not necessarily received a hacked (49:02 - 49:07)
pokemon in a trade (49:05 - 49:08)
but did something to their own cartridge (49:07 - 49:11)
or to their own save file yeah i doubt (49:08 - 49:14)
that anyone who received a hacked (49:11 - 49:15)
pokemon is getting (49:14 - 49:18)
banned i would assume that (49:15 - 49:21)
what you two said was was more accurate (49:18 - 49:24)
and i would i would wager to guess that (49:21 - 49:26)
it's (49:24 - 49:30)
probably more obvious of something like (49:26 - 49:32)
oh this mewtwo has an ability of you (49:30 - 49:34)
know damp and mewtwo can't have that (49:32 - 49:36)
ability and so therefore we know you've (49:34 - 49:39)
you've hacked it and you've cheated and (49:36 - 49:42)
i'd say different i would say (49:39 - 49:45)
that when you do your first attachment (49:42 - 49:47)
to the global length or whatever it is (49:45 - 49:49)
where you attach your (49:47 - 49:52)
pokemon id with your actual cartridge (49:49 - 49:55)
i think it does a snap of some portion (49:52 - 49:58)
of your game file and then if you did a (49:55 - 49:59)
later connection and they can tell that (49:58 - 50:01)
that portion has been modified in some (49:59 - 50:04)
way they know that you hacked something (50:01 - 50:07)
in in tried to (50:04 - 50:08)
well (50:07 - 50:09)
i don't think that they're banning (50:08 - 50:12)
people for being failed hackers i don't (50:09 - 50:14)
know (50:12 - 50:15)
i'm just saying that there's probably (50:14 - 50:18)
some checksum in there that it can (50:15 - 50:20)
verify against the data and if the data (50:18 - 50:21)
has been changed but that checksum (50:20 - 50:23)
hasn't been updated then they know (50:21 - 50:25)
you know and it's like it's sufficiently (50:23 - 50:27)
hidden that people hacking their files (50:25 - 50:29)
haven't found it yet because there used (50:27 - 50:31)
to be like the (50:29 - 50:33)
the your trainer id and then your hidden (50:31 - 50:35)
trainer id so if you were why am i (50:33 - 50:38)
telling people how to hack i was i was (50:35 - 50:39)
gonna say (50:38 - 50:41)
i got so (50:39 - 50:46)
the speed by which i got intensely bored (50:41 - 50:48)
and uninterested once i heard the phrase (50:46 - 50:51)
check some in the data (50:48 - 50:53)
lightning lightning speed i was almost (50:51 - 50:55)
already asleep i'm just saying that (50:53 - 50:57)
there's things you can insert into (50:55 - 50:59)
this is important when it comes to (50:57 - 51:00)
information security but there are (50:59 - 51:02)
things you can insert into programming (51:00 - 51:05)
that are sufficiently hidden but the (51:02 - 51:07)
program can do a check against itself (51:05 - 51:09)
and say all right this has changed but (51:07 - 51:10)
this didn't change to go with it so i (51:09 - 51:13)
know that i am no longer i'm a faulty (51:10 - 51:16)
pro anyways (51:13 - 51:20)
the children cannot follow adult topics (51:16 - 51:24)
i i appreciate your description of how (51:20 - 51:27)
things get hacked or not hacked (51:24 - 51:30)
uh but yeah there's your pokemon news a (51:27 - 51:32)
busier newsweek than uh than the last (51:30 - 51:34)
couple (51:32 - 51:37)
i don't i don't really like pausing our (51:34 - 51:39)
live streams just for the sake of i know (51:37 - 51:41)
as soon as we hit pause we lose a bunch (51:39 - 51:43)
of viewers because everyone has short (51:41 - 51:46)
attention spans but what we're gonna do (51:43 - 51:48)
is i am going to pause the stream for (51:46 - 51:49)
about (51:48 - 51:51)
60 seconds and then we'll be back the (51:49 - 51:52)
main reason i want to do that is because (51:51 - 51:53)
i want to make sure that these (51:52 - 51:56)
recordings get locked down so that we (51:53 - 51:58)
don't lose anything for the actual audio (51:56 - 52:00)
podcast so i'm going to put it to (51:58 - 52:03)
standby just for about 60 seconds just (52:00 - 52:05)
to make sure that the audio is good and (52:03 - 52:06)
then when we come back we're going to (52:05 - 52:08)
answer (52:06 - 52:10)
stuff in the twitch chat (52:08 - 52:12)
and then (52:10 - 52:14)
if possible we might do some giveaways (52:12 - 52:15)
as well for some stickers and some (52:14 - 52:18)
magnets and some buttons and so we'll i (52:15 - 52:20)
have stickers i have hopefully giveaways (52:18 - 52:22)
planned i want to answer you guys's (52:20 - 52:23)
questions in twitch chat and then we'll (52:22 - 52:25)
do our pokemon of the week so (52:23 - 52:27)
don't go anywhere we'll be back in about (52:25 - 52:29)
60 seconds i just want to save the audio (52:27 - 52:34)
so we will be right back (52:29 - 52:34)

this message is from chad (60:36 - 60:42)
i don't know if we did read this (60:38 - 60:44)
hmm i don't think so (60:42 - 60:47)
hi my name is chad first off (60:44 - 60:49)
first thanks for the past year of (60:47 - 60:51)
awesomeness i started listening to uh (60:49 - 60:54)
around episode 200 and i've been a fan (60:51 - 60:55)
ever since a little background i mean (60:54 - 60:57)
maybe one of your older listeners i am (60:55 - 61:00)
34 and ended up with pokemon and ended (60:57 - 61:02)
up in pokemon worlds thanks to my kids i (61:00 - 61:04)
have three does this sound familiar to (61:02 - 61:06)
you two (61:04 - 61:08)
okay (61:06 - 61:09)
they started playing pokemon and my wife (61:08 - 61:12)
and i picked up a starter pack (61:09 - 61:14)
of the tcg and picked up a copy of x for (61:12 - 61:16)
my 3ds (61:14 - 61:18)
this was either the best idea or the (61:16 - 61:20)
worst we both love pokemon now and it's (61:18 - 61:23)
on awesome hobby and past time we share (61:20 - 61:25)

there but thank you chad for writing in (61:58 - 62:02)
i appreciate it (62:00 - 62:04)
and i always like when people say that (62:02 - 62:07)
they have their kids listen to us too (62:04 - 62:08)
because i think that's (62:07 - 62:11)
really cool that pokemon is a game (62:08 - 62:13)
that's aimed for children and it's (62:11 - 62:16)
really cool to see when the game is (62:13 - 62:17)
passed down from generation to (62:16 - 62:19)
generation as we pass our pokemon up (62:17 - 62:22)
through pokemon bank from generation to (62:19 - 62:24)
generation well some of us do (62:22 - 62:27)
but sure obviously not all of us yeah (62:24 - 62:29)
not all of us uh so we'll we'll do some (62:27 - 62:31)
we'll do some twitch questions again i (62:29 - 62:33)
have like uh i have like magnets and (62:31 - 62:36)
stuff that these are magnets but i have (62:33 - 62:37)
stickers (62:36 - 62:38)
i thought they were like try i didn't (62:37 - 62:39)
because it's hard to tell from the (62:38 - 62:41)
camera that i didn't realize they were (62:39 - 62:43)
like magnets so like did you make (62:41 - 62:45)
coasters (62:43 - 62:47)
i mean i guess they'd be a pretty thin (62:45 - 62:49)
coaster and if you have a metal table it (62:47 - 62:52)
won't slide uh we will uh tackle it so (62:49 - 62:54)
we'll do some giveaways in a bit here (62:52 - 62:56)
we'll tackle some questions (62:54 - 62:58)
now that there are (62:56 - 63:02)
oh my gosh so many questions (62:58 - 63:02)
genuine gamer (63:06 - 63:10)
says are you guys going to build (63:08 - 63:13)
competitive teams to go to events in the (63:10 - 63:16)
future (63:13 - 63:16)
will's just shaking his head that (63:16 - 63:20)
doesn't come through in uh in audio oh (63:18 - 63:21)
well okay so because i was waiting for (63:20 - 63:24)
you to finish the question um i (63:21 - 63:27)
usually like to attend at least one (63:24 - 63:29)
regional a year if i can hopefully (63:27 - 63:31)
something close to dc (63:29 - 63:32)
um (63:31 - 63:33)
and (63:32 - 63:36)
outside of the realm of pokemon (63:33 - 63:38)
uh (63:36 - 63:39)
the company that makes card fight (63:38 - 63:42)
vanguard has really messed up their (63:39 - 63:44)
competitive regionals and everything (63:42 - 63:46)
this year so it's even more likely that (63:44 - 63:48)
i'll want to go to a pokemon regional (63:46 - 63:50)
and it gives me a chance to hang out (63:48 - 63:52)
with some of my friends so i will most (63:50 - 63:54)
likely get one team together and come to (63:52 - 63:56)
at least one regional and i will let (63:54 - 63:58)
people know which one that's going to be (63:56 - 64:01)
when that comes around (63:58 - 64:04)
yeah similar thing for me yeah similar (64:01 - 64:06)
thing it's (64:04 - 64:07)
i (64:06 - 64:09)
was mostly working on finishing milo and (64:07 - 64:11)
pokedex which (64:09 - 64:14)
i only need to (64:11 - 64:15)
remember to actually ask my girlfriend (64:14 - 64:17)
to trade me her (64:15 - 64:19)
lunala and then trade it back again and (64:17 - 64:21)
then i'll have completed my alolan (64:19 - 64:23)
pokedex and then i'll i'll start my team (64:21 - 64:26)
i think i've settled on that squad i'm (64:23 - 64:29)
gonna use (64:26 - 64:32)
after playing a lot on pokemon showdown (64:29 - 64:35)
it's not that exciting it's (64:32 - 64:37)
you know because sometimes you just (64:35 - 64:39)
want to win so (64:37 - 64:41)
so it's nothing you know i started with (64:39 - 64:41)
a (64:41 - 64:43)
a team that was doing very well it had (64:41 - 64:47)
weird stuff like bruxish and it had um (64:43 - 64:48)
uh (64:47 - 64:51)
beware and it was doing pretty well um (64:48 - 64:53)
on the lower ladder like it was crushing (64:51 - 64:55)
on the lower ladder and then (64:53 - 64:57)
when i got onto the higher ladder it (64:55 - 64:59)
stopped doing well which is sort of the (64:57 - 65:01)
opposite of what the current team i (64:59 - 65:03)
ended up with was doing it wasn't doing (65:01 - 65:05)
very well lower but once i got higher it (65:03 - 65:08)
started doing well the one i think i'm (65:05 - 65:12)
gonna make centers around um (65:08 - 65:14)
uh choice scarf (65:12 - 65:15)
uh (65:14 - 65:19)
vanillux to just uh use blizzard (65:15 - 65:21)
a lot and then ha and that's the only (65:19 - 65:23)
like interesting choice that i made on (65:21 - 65:25)
the team the rest of the stuff is pretty (65:23 - 65:28)
boring and tapus and arcanine and some (65:25 - 65:29)
ultra beasts (65:28 - 65:30)
sure (65:29 - 65:31)
all right (65:30 - 65:33)
all right (65:31 - 65:35)
uh as for me probably (65:33 - 65:38)
not i'm not really (65:35 - 65:41)
into the competitive scene as much as as (65:38 - 65:44)
will and travis are i've accepted my (65:41 - 65:45)
fate that i am (65:44 - 65:49)
not really too good at it (65:45 - 65:49)
but as for like attending (65:49 - 65:57)
regionals or future events (65:53 - 65:59)
i i hope i think there will be more of (65:57 - 66:02)
those this year for us whether that or (65:59 - 66:04)
not that's specifically a regionals but (66:02 - 66:05)
uh (66:04 - 66:10)
pax or c2e2 or or midwest gaming classic (66:05 - 66:11)
like those are definitely events that (66:10 - 66:13)
i'll be at (66:11 - 66:16)
i'm happy to say that (66:13 - 66:19)
the packs in boston uh will be the first (66:16 - 66:22)
time live featuring not only me because (66:19 - 66:24)
i'm i'm there at every event live (66:22 - 66:26)
obviously but uh will and travis will (66:24 - 66:30)
both be there with me (66:26 - 66:30)
that (66:34 - 66:39)
that is just really exciting and and (66:35 - 66:40)
something that (66:39 - 66:43)
uh we we got worked out very quickly and (66:40 - 66:47)
planned very quickly and so i know (66:43 - 66:49)
tickets have been sold out for pax (66:47 - 66:51)
boston i believe we are speaking on (66:49 - 66:54)
friday i think at 2 p.m (66:51 - 66:56)
so i don't know all the details there i (66:54 - 66:57)
don't know if it's still possible to get (66:56 - 67:00)
day passes there or or whatnot i know (66:57 - 67:02)
sometimes people (67:00 - 67:03)
buy a three-day pass but they don't plan (67:02 - 67:05)
on going one of the two days so they (67:03 - 67:07)
sell the well what pax does is they (67:05 - 67:09)
don't give you a universal pass they (67:07 - 67:12)
give you three passes for each day and (67:09 - 67:14)
so sometimes people don't go to sunday (67:12 - 67:15)
or sometimes people don't go to friday (67:14 - 67:18)
so they sell those passes separately (67:15 - 67:20)
i don't have all the details there but i (67:18 - 67:21)
do know if you can't attend pax (67:20 - 67:23)
obviously we'll have that recorded (67:21 - 67:25)
but yeah it's very exciting that for the (67:23 - 67:27)
first time (67:25 - 67:28)
travis will and i will all be at the (67:27 - 67:30)
same like (67:28 - 67:32)
event actually actually presenting it (67:30 - 67:33)
was (67:32 - 67:35)
really funny that when i went to the (67:33 - 67:38)
seattle packs pax west and i spoke (67:35 - 67:40)
and did what i did you know (67:38 - 67:43)
mispronounced stuff and and (67:40 - 67:45)
whatnot uh we had a couple people come (67:43 - 67:47)
up to me after the show and they were (67:45 - 67:48)
like oh i really you know i really (67:47 - 67:50)
wanted to just meet will (67:48 - 67:52)
or i you know i was i was really (67:50 - 67:54)
expecting to see travis and i was like (67:52 - 67:58)
well i i'm here guys but me (67:54 - 67:58)
but no that was uh that was (68:00 - 68:06)
i get it i totally get it when i listen (68:04 - 68:08)
to podcasts there are definitely people (68:06 - 68:10)
that i like more than other people or (68:08 - 68:13)
just people that i deal with better (68:10 - 68:15)
no one gels with me of course i am the (68:13 - 68:17)
i'm the voice of disagreement on the (68:15 - 68:19)
shows but that that is why you two are (68:17 - 68:21)
here because there are there are some (68:19 - 68:23)
there is some (68:21 - 68:28)
uh ways to easily relate to you guys (68:23 - 68:30)
uh just a reminder if you're watching (68:28 - 68:32)
and you tweet at pokemon if you tweet (68:30 - 68:35)
hashtag pkmncast it will appear on our (68:32 - 68:36)
twitch stream (68:35 - 68:38)
just reminder there next question here (68:36 - 68:41)
is i'm missing questions so i'll circle (68:38 - 68:44)
back if i missed it uh by mdude430 what (68:41 - 68:46)
is your favorite piece of music from (68:44 - 68:50)
pokemon sun and moon (68:46 - 68:50)
that's a tough question because i like (68:51 - 68:55)
the champions theme that was in (68:53 - 68:56)
[Music] (68:55 - 68:58)
i like the champions theme that was in (68:56 - 69:00)
all the trailers i think that i mean (68:58 - 69:00)
it's (69:00 - 69:02)
sort of weird that i'm saying oh the (69:00 - 69:04)
song that was in the trailer but that (69:02 - 69:07)
song is (69:04 - 69:07)
i think it's just (69:08 - 69:14)
awesome and doesn't have that (69:11 - 69:15)
the (69:14 - 69:17)
aesthetic that a typical pokemon song (69:15 - 69:19)
does not that pokemon music in general (69:17 - 69:22)
is bad but it's just a very new (69:19 - 69:25)
aesthetic that fits the new region in a (69:22 - 69:26)
cool way (69:25 - 69:27)
and (69:26 - 69:31)
i don't know has a lot of energy to it (69:27 - 69:31)
will (69:32 - 69:35)
i just it hasn't suffused me yet for me (69:33 - 69:37)
to have something (69:35 - 69:40)
picked out as as an individual like you (69:37 - 69:41)
know (69:40 - 69:44)
obviously for me the unova themes if you (69:41 - 69:46)
play something for me i can actually (69:44 - 69:48)
name exactly what song it is where it's (69:46 - 69:50)
from everything trainers eyes meet yeah (69:48 - 69:53)
of course right no but it's like i have (69:50 - 69:55)
you like you know you have songs in your (69:53 - 69:58)
playlists where like if it comes on you (69:55 - 70:00)
never skip it it's just like that kind (69:58 - 70:02)
of a song for you so like isaris city (70:00 - 70:04)
for me i can never skip that song no (70:02 - 70:06)
matter if like i'm in the most horrible (70:04 - 70:07)
mood and listening to pressing (70:06 - 70:09)
depressing movie music and then like (70:07 - 70:10)
that song comes on it's like i still (70:09 - 70:13)
have to listen to it (70:10 - 70:14)
but yeah i'm just not there with sun and (70:13 - 70:18)
moon yet all right i (70:14 - 70:19)
have said this before i normally play (70:18 - 70:22)
the games with (70:19 - 70:24)
the volume pretty low (70:22 - 70:27)
so i don't really hear the full range of (70:24 - 70:29)
of music but i do (70:27 - 70:31)
know that one (70:29 - 70:33)
the two songs that stuck out stood out (70:31 - 70:34)
to me (70:33 - 70:37)
uh was the team skull theme song (70:34 - 70:39)
and then uh gladion's theme song which i (70:37 - 70:41)
think is what is gladions like a slight (70:39 - 70:43)
i can't remember it's like slightly (70:41 - 70:45)
different than team skull but shares a (70:43 - 70:47)
couple of the notes (70:45 - 70:50)
could be yeah i don't really remember (70:47 - 70:51)
i don't remember (70:50 - 70:53)
i can't like i like both of them but i'm (70:51 - 70:55)
not sure which one is which offhand but (70:53 - 70:57)
yeah those were the those were the songs (70:55 - 70:58)
that stood out to me (70:57 - 71:01)
lysander03 asks uh are we allowed to (70:58 - 71:05)
talk about post game yet no (71:01 - 71:05)
uh we'll get to that eventually (71:06 - 71:10)
uh everyone dies actually it's really (71:08 - 71:13)
weird for a pokemon game literally every (71:10 - 71:15)
character just dies (71:13 - 71:18)
it's real brutal uh (71:15 - 71:19)
are we only not talking about post game (71:18 - 71:21)
because you haven't played the post game (71:19 - 71:23)
yet steve hey i talked to the girl with (71:21 - 71:25)
the purple hair (71:23 - 71:25)
standing next to the abigail yeah no (71:25 - 71:30)
that's no her name's not abigail is it (71:28 - 71:32)
looker's boss (71:30 - 71:34)
yeah lookers bought eight isn't her name (71:32 - 71:36)
abigail (71:34 - 71:38)
no i thought it was shorter but i didn't (71:36 - 71:40)
think it started with an a sorry i have (71:38 - 71:44)
to like turn my questions over here uh (71:40 - 71:44)
justify why i'm like messing with my mic (71:46 - 71:49)
um (71:48 - 71:51)
read it and weep (71:49 - 71:56)
says is a hot pocket a sandwich (71:51 - 71:56)
obviously not (71:57 - 72:00)
period (72:01 - 72:05)
period done no (72:02 - 72:07)
the breading is not independent in any (72:05 - 72:10)
way shape or form is a corn dog a (72:07 - 72:12)
sandwich a hot pocket is basically a (72:10 - 72:15)
corn dog without a stick (72:12 - 72:15)
i want to apologize her name is (72:15 - 72:19)
annabelle not abigail and i realize i'm (72:17 - 72:21)
late and i'm not talking about yeah (72:19 - 72:23)
no that's fine (72:21 - 72:24)
i knew it i knew it started with the (72:23 - 72:28)
name i knew it was an abigail um (72:24 - 72:28)
a hot pocket is not a sandwich (72:29 - 72:33)
i have to agree with will a hot dog on (72:31 - 72:34)
the other hand (72:33 - 72:37)
possibly (72:34 - 72:37)
i will leave right now and take (72:39 - 72:46)
one third of your listeners with me (72:43 - 72:48)
i know yeah (72:46 - 72:50)
i know you've got more of a pull than (72:48 - 72:52)
one third (72:50 - 72:52)
you're the (72:53 - 72:58)
you're the fan favorite that's not true (72:54 - 72:59)
you're the glue holding the ship (72:58 - 73:01)
together (72:59 - 73:02)
that's debatable (73:01 - 73:05)
debatable i know we've we've answered (73:02 - 73:06)
this question before but i i believe (73:05 - 73:08)
either travis or will wasn't here for (73:06 - 73:11)
this i think uh i think b team's finest (73:08 - 73:13)
micah was here uh (73:11 - 73:15)
midnight shadow (73:13 - 73:18)
says what is your favorite pokemon merch (73:15 - 73:20)
you all own (73:18 - 73:20)
let me go into my bag of pokemon merch (73:23 - 73:27)
which i just happen to have why did this (73:27 - 73:32)
happen this would be right here all (73:29 - 73:34)
right that's pretty great what is that (73:32 - 73:38)
that's the world's 2016 binder uh (73:34 - 73:40)
2014 (73:38 - 73:44)
uh it is a notebook (73:40 - 73:46)
still in the wrapper probably worth (73:44 - 73:49)
about five dollars on ebay (73:46 - 73:52)
yep you know it's worth a lot (73:49 - 73:54)
there were specific (73:52 - 73:56)
timbuktu (73:54 - 73:58)
pokemon bags that went out to just (73:56 - 74:02)
like top people who place top cut or (73:58 - 74:03)
whatever they call it for the video game (74:02 - 74:06)
i think it's still top cut uh but those (74:03 - 74:08)
are worth quite a bit (74:06 - 74:09)
um (74:08 - 74:11)
you can get timbuktu (74:09 - 74:13)
pokemon stuff (74:11 - 74:15)
on pokemoncenter.com but it's not the (74:13 - 74:17)
same as this specific bag was and i (74:15 - 74:19)
think they did it two or two or three (74:17 - 74:21)
years in a row but i think it's a better (74:19 - 74:23)
looking bag it's it's black with with (74:21 - 74:26)
some embroider embroidered mint on it (74:23 - 74:27)
but yeah that's actually worth quite a (74:26 - 74:29)
bit wait pretty much anything that is (74:27 - 74:30)
own (74:29 - 74:32)
anything that's a video format you guys (74:30 - 74:34)
spam you guys (74:32 - 74:35)
all right (74:34 - 74:37)
uh we are in a video format (74:35 - 74:39)
of course uh will just left for those (74:37 - 74:42)
listening to audio (74:39 - 74:43)
anything (74:42 - 74:46)
that is top cut specific definitely (74:43 - 74:48)
worth money uh travis do you have a (74:46 - 74:50)
favorite pokemon merch as will is off (74:48 - 74:53)
doing something (74:50 - 74:56)
probably my woo bat plushie i like wubat (74:53 - 74:58)
it's not a pokemon i talk about a lot (74:56 - 75:01)
but i really like it and it saddens me (74:58 - 75:03)
but that people just say it's (75:01 - 75:05)
it's annoying because they already don't (75:03 - 75:07)
like zubat so they automatically don't (75:05 - 75:09)
like wubat and don't realize that wubat (75:07 - 75:10)
and swoobat (75:09 - 75:13)
are really cute (75:10 - 75:13)
and then i have snorlax plushie that i (75:14 - 75:16)
like too (75:15 - 75:18)
that (75:16 - 75:19)
it's one of those that has (75:18 - 75:21)
some memories tied to it because a (75:19 - 75:24)
friend bought it for me when we were in (75:21 - 75:27)
on a high school trip to (75:24 - 75:30)
disney world as steve is slowly (75:27 - 75:32)
raising a (75:30 - 75:34)
jirachi blush up (75:32 - 75:37)
into the frame (75:34 - 75:38)
but yeah so they're i mean they're (75:37 - 75:40)
plushies that i have like memories (75:38 - 75:42)
associated with like certain trips where (75:40 - 75:44)
i got them but um (75:42 - 75:45)
if we take those factors out of it (75:44 - 75:47)
probably the woo bat plushie is my (75:45 - 75:49)
favorite (75:47 - 75:51)
so when i answered this question the (75:49 - 75:53)
first time and i realized this is very (75:51 - 75:55)
special to me that i wanted to say this (75:53 - 75:56)
i had talked about the gifts i got from (75:55 - 75:58)
andrew in japan (75:56 - 76:01)
um and i talked about the furoshi which (75:58 - 76:02)
for some reason is probably like on the (76:01 - 76:04)
other side of my computer and i just (76:02 - 76:06)
can't find it right now but he also gave (76:04 - 76:08)
me this little bag that i keep my 3ds in (76:06 - 76:11)
that has the x and y starters in (76:08 - 76:12)
but i wanted to bring that up because he (76:11 - 76:15)
just had twins like yesterday (76:12 - 76:17)
which is really cool (76:15 - 76:20)
oh yeah (76:17 - 76:20)

wait what's the word you called that a (76:31 - 76:34)
furoski (76:33 - 76:37)
this is just a bag but my i like i can't (76:34 - 76:38)
find the ferocious getting enough time (76:37 - 76:40)
yeah (76:38 - 76:40)
he sounds like a seinfeld episode (76:41 - 76:45)
furoshi now serenity now so don't do (76:45 - 76:50)
well (76:49 - 76:52)
as a philosophy student of virtually on (76:50 - 76:55)
the moon on the moon (76:52 - 76:57)
all right how many i mean (76:55 - 76:58)
the real question (76:57 - 77:01)
how many cats do you think (76:58 - 77:03)
is what i'm about to hold up (77:01 - 77:06)
five (77:03 - 77:07)

that's pretty good that's not five cats (77:11 - 77:18)
well (77:15 - 77:18)
it's pretty big sorry i was away from my (77:18 - 77:23)
mic it's probably (77:20 - 77:23)
each ear is one cat (77:24 - 77:28)
for the audio listener (77:26 - 77:32)
it's a big it's like you face but face (77:28 - 77:33)
only (77:32 - 77:35)
covered in cat hair too because my kit (77:33 - 77:37)
hello i got that this is fine plush (77:35 - 77:38)
right here too (77:37 - 77:41)
is it a pillow or is it a plush (77:38 - 77:43)
it's uh i believe at some pokemon (77:41 - 77:45)
center.com right now it's i think it's (77:43 - 77:48)
forty dollars it's a pillow did i ever (77:45 - 77:51)
tell you so i got this thing at gen con (77:48 - 77:53)
and they had a bunch of plushes at gen (77:51 - 77:55)
con like they had the the giant (77:53 - 77:57)
bulbasaur (77:55 - 78:00)
plush and squirtle and pikachu and then (77:57 - 78:02)
they had this pikachu head and it was i (78:00 - 78:06)
think it was priced at 30 29 maybe 29 or (78:02 - 78:07)
something (78:06 - 78:09)
and i was like oh that's a that's a good (78:07 - 78:11)
price uh for that (78:09 - 78:13)
and so i was like i'll get that that's (78:11 - 78:13)
cool (78:13 - 78:16)
and i went to check out and rang up i i (78:13 - 78:18)
think it rang up as 50 (78:16 - 78:20)
and i was like ah that's fine like i'm (78:18 - 78:22)
already here i'm not gonna (78:20 - 78:23)
here's my money just whatever i just (78:22 - 78:25)
want to get out of line (78:23 - 78:27)
and (78:25 - 78:30)
i i pulled somebody aside who wasn't (78:27 - 78:33)
that wasn't busy after after i purchased (78:30 - 78:36)
it purchased it it did it (78:33 - 78:37)
it (78:36 - 78:40)
just butchering words (78:37 - 78:42)
and (78:40 - 78:42)
i was like hey (78:42 - 78:46)
i just paid 50 for this and i pointed to (78:44 - 78:48)
it at the shelf and i was like it's it's (78:46 - 78:52)
labeled 29 over there so either i was (78:48 - 78:55)
wrong up wrong or (78:52 - 78:57)
or it's miss miss it's it's not priced (78:55 - 78:59)
right and i just don't want anyone in (78:57 - 79:00)
the future to (78:59 - 79:02)
you know (79:00 - 79:04)
try to buy that and then have the same (79:02 - 79:07)
issue i did (79:04 - 79:09)
but maybe they just rang me up wrong and (79:07 - 79:12)
he was like oh no that's that's totally (79:09 - 79:14)
it is supposed to be 50 but you're right (79:12 - 79:16)
it was miss price so they (79:14 - 79:18)
they gave me a refund but then they also (79:16 - 79:20)
gave me like 20 off for pointing out the (79:18 - 79:22)
issue or whatever so it came to like 20 (79:20 - 79:24)
bucks instead of like 50 bucks that it (79:22 - 79:27)
was supposed to be ah it's like not my (79:24 - 79:29)
all-time favorite piece of pokemon (79:27 - 79:31)
merchandise but it's it's probably three (79:29 - 79:33)
cats big so (79:31 - 79:35)
that in itself (79:33 - 79:38)
oh here's the this is fine dog (79:35 - 79:39)
the (79:38 - 79:42)
cat ratio here (79:39 - 79:42)
throw them on the ground uh yeah so (79:45 - 79:51)
how many hot dogs is it (79:48 - 79:55)
cat dog was not a good tv show (79:51 - 79:57)
that does not answer my question (79:55 - 79:59)
and also it wasn't that bad if memory (79:57 - 80:00)
serves (79:59 - 80:02)
oh it was awful (80:00 - 80:04)
oh was it comparative to other programs (80:02 - 80:06)
that were on at the same time yeah (80:04 - 80:08)
there were better tv shows uh pat from (80:06 - 80:09)
pallet (80:08 - 80:12)
says what drives three of you to keep (80:09 - 80:14)
such a dedicated interest in pokemon (80:12 - 80:16)
games as well as your pokemon fans from (80:14 - 80:18)
ise (80:16 - 80:21)
the money (80:18 - 80:21)
i don't know i i just really like (80:25 - 80:30)
pokemon (80:27 - 80:30)
the games are (80:30 - 80:34)
the precise they have the precise (80:31 - 80:37)
formula of (80:34 - 80:37)
things that i like in video games they (80:37 - 80:41)
have characters that are (80:39 - 80:44)
well designed that i can easily fall in (80:41 - 80:48)
love with it has rpg it's an rpg so i (80:44 - 80:50)
can feel like i am (80:48 - 80:52)
growing with the characters it has (80:50 - 80:54)
interactivity so i can play with my (80:52 - 80:55)
friends (80:54 - 80:56)
it's got all of (80:55 - 80:58)
the things that i like and then add to (80:56 - 81:01)
that the fact that as each game comes (80:58 - 81:02)
out there's another layer of nostalgia (81:01 - 81:04)
that i'm tapping into whenever a new (81:02 - 81:07)
game comes out so it just happens to be (81:04 - 81:09)
a franchise that's perfectly tailored to (81:07 - 81:11)
the things i like so it's not that hard (81:09 - 81:15)
for me to continue to like it you know (81:11 - 81:15)
will (81:15 - 81:18)
anything i mean i just like the the (81:16 - 81:20)
people that we get to meet from doing (81:18 - 81:22)
this and you know that's you know (81:20 - 81:24)
playing pokemon and (81:22 - 81:25)
enjoying the games and being able to (81:24 - 81:28)
talk about them gives me access to so (81:25 - 81:30)
many wonderful people who also enjoy the (81:28 - 81:32)
games and we can have that shared space (81:30 - 81:34)
for conversation that can then lead on (81:32 - 81:36)
to other conversations (81:34 - 81:38)
that too (81:36 - 81:38)
yeah for me it's (81:39 - 81:45)
it's it's a space of (81:41 - 81:45)
community (81:46 - 81:48)
like (81:47 - 81:49)
i don't (81:48 - 81:53)
it's hard to imagine what what (81:49 - 81:55)
the community was like before slack (81:53 - 81:58)
because my days usually start and end (81:55 - 81:59)
with checking the slack and seeing (81:58 - 82:01)
everyone (81:59 - 82:03)
talk and be friendly and and (82:01 - 82:05)
just even last night when when andrew (82:03 - 82:07)
our friend from japan had his two kids (82:05 - 82:10)
and posted that he was a new father and (82:07 - 82:13)
everyone like congratulated him and he (82:10 - 82:15)
he like took the time (82:13 - 82:17)
i'm sure there was a million people (82:15 - 82:20)
he texted or told (82:17 - 82:23)
but the fact that he took a moment to (82:20 - 82:26)
like show a picture of his new he had (82:23 - 82:30)
twins by the way of of his two new kids (82:26 - 82:31)
and (82:30 - 82:32)
like that was really special and that (82:31 - 82:34)
was really cool and (82:32 - 82:36)
uh (82:34 - 82:37)
the emails we get (82:36 - 82:39)
and just the community in general around (82:37 - 82:42)
this podcast has just (82:39 - 82:44)
been in itself something that's very (82:42 - 82:47)
motivating and something that (82:44 - 82:50)
gives me a reason to do it every week (82:47 - 82:52)
and then the of course the product (82:50 - 82:54)
itself is something i enjoy like i like (82:52 - 82:56)
the games i like the tv show for the (82:54 - 82:57)
most part i mean i'll complain about it (82:56 - 83:00)
but i did enjoy the time i spent uh with (82:57 - 83:02)
the card game (83:00 - 83:04)
um (83:02 - 83:04)
and i just like a lot of stuff (83:05 - 83:10)
about everything and even though i only (83:08 - 83:14)
put 40 hours into pokemon sun and i know (83:10 - 83:18)
most of our listeners put 200 or 400 or (83:14 - 83:19)
however many hours in the game like (83:18 - 83:22)
that's still a good amount of time and i (83:19 - 83:25)
can put you know 10 hours into uncharted (83:22 - 83:26)
4 or (83:25 - 83:29)
6 hours into duskers or 20 hours into (83:26 - 83:32)
monster hunter but (83:29 - 83:32)
the 40 hours i put into pokemon are (83:33 - 83:38)
really like something i remember very (83:35 - 83:41)
very well and something that i enjoyed (83:38 - 83:42)
and it's also something i look forward (83:41 - 83:45)
to every three years or two years or (83:42 - 83:48)
however many they put it off and i would (83:45 - 83:49)
probably (83:48 - 83:50)
and when i played the card game it was (83:49 - 83:51)
like every three months i looked forward (83:50 - 83:54)
to the new set and i was very excited (83:51 - 83:56)
and i spent a lot of money and that's (83:54 - 83:57)
one of the reasons why i left that but (83:56 - 83:59)
uh it was still it's almost like pokemon (83:57 - 84:01)
always gives you something to look (83:59 - 84:06)
forward to whereas other franchises (84:01 - 84:08)
don't do that (84:06 - 84:09)
and that's kind of weird to say because (84:08 - 84:11)
you know obviously other franchises (84:09 - 84:14)
continue and do more stuff but there's (84:11 - 84:15)
just something about pokemon where it's (84:14 - 84:17)
it's like every (84:15 - 84:20)
every week there's almost something new (84:17 - 84:21)
and obviously there's something new (84:20 - 84:22)
because we end up talking about (84:21 - 84:24)
something every week and there's usually (84:22 - 84:25)
one or two news articles every single (84:24 - 84:27)
week and that's just i don't know if a (84:25 - 84:29)
lot of other franchises have that if (84:27 - 84:30)
they're not like league of legends or (84:29 - 84:32)
wow or dota or (84:30 - 84:34)
you know something really really big (84:32 - 84:35)
but pokemon is something that's really (84:34 - 84:38)
big and i and people outside of the (84:35 - 84:40)
community might not see that (84:38 - 84:42)
i get asked that all the time of like oh (84:40 - 84:43)
you do a pokemon podcast what is there (84:42 - 84:45)
to talk about every week and it's like (84:43 - 84:46)
oh boy (84:45 - 84:50)
there's a lot to talk about every week (84:46 - 84:50)
so that's my hand you managed to make (84:51 - 84:55)
three hour episodes not infrequently (84:52 - 84:57)
so does anybody find it strange that (84:55 - 85:00)
andrew named his twins uh reuniklus and (84:57 - 85:01)
gothitel (85:00 - 85:04)
yeah it was uh a little odd you know i (85:01 - 85:07)
support his choice but (85:04 - 85:09)
you know (85:07 - 85:12)
coma five fans unite but boy those (85:09 - 85:14)
virgin exclusive psychic pokemon that's (85:12 - 85:16)
a little odd (85:14 - 85:17)
uh (85:16 - 85:19)
make some cute nicknames out of (85:17 - 85:21)
reuniklis and gothitel (85:19 - 85:23)
he could be like renny (85:21 - 85:26)
renny and tally (85:23 - 85:28)
all right you know i mean there's (85:26 - 85:31)
something in there (85:28 - 85:31)
uh (85:32 - 85:36)
coma5 says (85:33 - 85:36)
where i lost the question now can we see (85:36 - 85:42)
a world verse travis series on youtube (85:38 - 85:42)
what is that (85:42 - 85:45)
what was that (85:44 - 85:47)
as you know literally something i was (85:45 - 85:50)
thinking earlier today is for the the (85:47 - 85:53)
defining thing between travis and me is (85:50 - 85:57)
for as much as i love pedantry travis (85:53 - 85:59)
hates (85:57 - 85:59)
that (86:01 - 86:05)
and we will battle to the end (86:02 - 86:07)
does this question mean (86:05 - 86:09)
does this question ask or want us to (86:07 - 86:11)
like fight (86:09 - 86:13)
like i think (86:11 - 86:14)
i think it's like pokemon with that (86:13 - 86:17)
there's there's no question yeah no (86:14 - 86:19)
yeah because i will lose (86:17 - 86:22)
like streaming pokemon (86:19 - 86:26)
like a pokemon battle competition (86:22 - 86:26)
i mean sure sure we can do that (86:27 - 86:32)
give me some time to breed a team yeah (86:30 - 86:35)
same it'll take me a while but (86:32 - 86:38)
uh jay kendall (86:35 - 86:40)
says i'm considering getting into the (86:38 - 86:43)
tcg is it worth it (86:40 - 86:43)
it depends on how rich you are (86:44 - 86:48)
i mean i love trading card games if i (86:48 - 86:51)
could afford the pokemon trading card (86:50 - 86:52)
game i would still be playing the (86:51 - 86:54)
pokemon trading card game but (86:52 - 86:57)
it's it's just too expensive for me to (86:54 - 86:59)
keep up with (86:57 - 87:01)
yeah (86:59 - 87:01)
uh (87:01 - 87:03)
i love the gameplay i like that it's (87:01 - 87:05)
they always keep it balanced and they (87:03 - 87:06)
always change it you know they're always (87:05 - 87:08)
introducing something new (87:06 - 87:11)
it really doesn't get stale but (87:08 - 87:13)
it's expensive this is what i would say (87:11 - 87:15)
i would say that if you're (87:13 - 87:19)
thinking about getting into the tcg (87:15 - 87:21)
i would (87:19 - 87:24)
say you should if you have one or two or (87:21 - 87:26)
even more friends that are willing to (87:24 - 87:30)
get in to it with you (87:26 - 87:30)
and then if you are getting to the tcg (87:30 - 87:35)
it just depends on how (87:33 - 87:38)
uh competitive or (87:35 - 87:39)
not not so (87:38 - 87:41)
much being competitive but if you wanted (87:39 - 87:43)
to like travel to competitions to at (87:41 - 87:46)
least hang out with people and do that (87:43 - 87:48)
because at (87:46 - 87:50)
the competitions at like regionals or or (87:48 - 87:52)
states or anything (87:50 - 87:53)
like there are (87:52 - 87:56)
side events with the card game (87:53 - 87:59)
that you can win prizes and stuff for (87:56 - 88:01)
but if you don't have anyone to travel (87:59 - 88:05)
with or anyone to like split gas split (88:01 - 88:07)
gas or (88:05 - 88:09)
or anything with or even like hotels if (88:07 - 88:11)
it's if it's far enough away like will (88:09 - 88:13)
and i met up in indiana a couple times (88:11 - 88:16)
and that was us driving like a wheel 10 (88:13 - 88:18)
hours one way me six hours the other way (88:16 - 88:19)
and (88:18 - 88:22)
and like that cost adds up (88:19 - 88:23)
so if (88:22 - 88:25)
it's (88:23 - 88:27)
definitely an expensive hobby if you (88:25 - 88:29)
plan on keeping up with it now there is (88:27 - 88:31)
you could go the route of not buying (88:29 - 88:34)
booster packs and and playing (88:31 - 88:37)
and just buying cards for what decks are (88:34 - 88:39)
doing very well and some decks are (88:37 - 88:42)
pretty cheap uh like the zekrom electric (88:39 - 88:44)
deck uh which was very popular when will (88:42 - 88:48)
not will and i was playing was like a 15 (88:44 - 88:50)
deck if all when when all said and done (88:48 - 88:52)
when you bought the cards (88:50 - 88:54)
but there was a mewtwo dark card deck (88:52 - 88:56)
right before worlds and that was about a (88:54 - 89:00)
560 deck because mewtwo and darkrai were (88:56 - 89:01)
were (89:00 - 89:03)
60 to 70 a piece and you needed four of (89:01 - 89:05)
each so that's eight cards that are 60 (89:03 - 89:07)
some dollars each (89:05 - 89:10)
and that was the best deck at the time (89:07 - 89:12)
whereas zekrom electric it was one of (89:10 - 89:14)
the best decks at the time i actually (89:12 - 89:16)
think it won quite a bit and it was like (89:14 - 89:19)
a 15 deck so it just depends on on money (89:16 - 89:21)
you want to spend (89:19 - 89:24)
somebody in chat asked what happened to (89:21 - 89:28)
glove window that was doodlebro 43. (89:24 - 89:30)
there's glove window right there it's (89:28 - 89:31)
just a regular window now (89:30 - 89:33)
but i was also going to say if you get (89:31 - 89:35)
into tcgs and you're a regular person (89:33 - 89:37)
like me prepare for your home to be (89:35 - 89:39)
covered in playing stacks and stacks of (89:37 - 89:42)
playing cards and playing card boxes (89:39 - 89:43)
that they come in (89:42 - 89:44)
um (89:43 - 89:46)
because you just keep buying them and (89:44 - 89:47)
you end up with a bunch of junk ones (89:46 - 89:49)
that you're never going to use but you (89:47 - 89:50)
don't want to throw them away i mean (89:49 - 89:54)
they're nice cards that were printed (89:50 - 89:54)
midnight shadow says when is the next (89:56 - 90:01)
art show (89:58 - 90:01)
oh boy (90:02 - 90:06)
ah (90:03 - 90:08)
right now never (90:06 - 90:10)
i shouldn't say i shouldn't say that i (90:08 - 90:13)
would say that if i was to do another so (90:10 - 90:15)
the hardest part (90:13 - 90:16)
about (90:15 - 90:20)
the art show i think is the venue itself (90:16 - 90:22)
and finding a venue i don't know so i've (90:20 - 90:24)
done two art shows before two pokemon (90:22 - 90:27)
art shows they were uh (90:24 - 90:29)
they were done four charities both to (90:27 - 90:30)
child's play both raised over a thousand (90:29 - 90:33)
dollars for child's play (90:30 - 90:35)
and uh actually getting the artists and (90:33 - 90:37)
getting the art that was actually (90:35 - 90:40)
surprisingly easy especially for the (90:37 - 90:42)
first art show i think i was in contact (90:40 - 90:46)
with a hundred artists uh 70 or (90:42 - 90:48)
68 of them came through and that was (90:46 - 90:50)
really great (90:48 - 90:51)
um (90:50 - 90:53)
but i had a venue (90:51 - 90:55)
that i found after a bunch of research (90:53 - 90:57)
and a bunch of talking to people and (90:55 - 90:58)
like going places and like sitting down (90:57 - 91:00)
and like waiting for them to give me the (90:58 - 91:02)
tour and seeing if it was okay and then (91:00 - 91:04)
you know paying for the venue itself up (91:02 - 91:04)
front (91:04 - 91:06)
i had a venue called bucketworks which (91:04 - 91:08)
is really great that was the one that (91:06 - 91:10)
will was at and it was like the the best (91:08 - 91:11)
size (91:10 - 91:13)
not the best location but a pretty (91:11 - 91:15)
decent location and (91:13 - 91:16)
and we did the art show there i mean i (91:15 - 91:19)
was there too it wasn't just will you (91:16 - 91:20)
know traffic because you went to both of (91:19 - 91:21)
them (91:20 - 91:23)
i did go to both of them oh you didn't (91:21 - 91:25)
go to battle city (91:23 - 91:26)
no (91:25 - 91:29)
uh so then the the second art show (91:26 - 91:31)
uh which was about a year later we (91:29 - 91:33)
changed the theme (91:31 - 91:35)
um it was it was supposed to be at (91:33 - 91:37)
bucketworks i i made all the promotional (91:35 - 91:40)
material i had you know a thousand (91:37 - 91:43)
posters printed and all these postcards (91:40 - 91:45)
printed like 500 postcards printed (91:43 - 91:47)
it said this date i don't remember the (91:45 - 91:49)
date and it said bucket works it had the (91:47 - 91:51)
address and then (91:49 - 91:53)
two weeks after i printed all that stuff (91:51 - 91:55)
out bucketworks was like hey we're going (91:53 - 91:58)
out of business we have no money uh (91:55 - 92:01)
sorry you don't have a venue now it was (91:58 - 92:02)
like (92:01 - 92:04)
oh well all right uh i don't know i'm (92:02 - 92:06)
supposed to find a venue in like three (92:04 - 92:07)
months but (92:06 - 92:10)
uh here we go and (92:07 - 92:11)
uh (92:10 - 92:16)
uh a shout out to micah who was (92:11 - 92:17)
somebody who helped me find a new venue (92:16 - 92:20)
and we found a new venue and i don't (92:17 - 92:23)
think it was as great as bucketworks uh (92:20 - 92:25)
it was definitely bigger (92:23 - 92:28)
uh and it was a lot more work to and (92:25 - 92:31)
money to reprint and do everything and (92:28 - 92:33)
and and move it all over (92:31 - 92:35)
i don't think it was as successful as (92:33 - 92:37)
the first one uh so (92:35 - 92:39)
would i want to do another art show yes (92:37 - 92:41)
i don't think milwaukee is the best (92:39 - 92:43)
place for that (92:41 - 92:44)
so it would have to be in another city (92:43 - 92:47)
whether or not if i move there or i can (92:44 - 92:48)
you know (92:47 - 92:50)
work with another city that's you know (92:48 - 92:52)
an hour to away like chicago or (92:50 - 92:54)
something because i'm in the milwaukee (92:52 - 92:54)
area (92:54 - 92:56)
it would have to be something like that (92:54 - 92:58)
and the hardest part would be you know (92:56 - 93:00)
finding a venue getting the time and (92:58 - 93:02)
then working with artists after that but (93:00 - 93:04)
really securing a venue is the the (93:02 - 93:06)
hardest part and and quite frankly (93:04 - 93:07)
there's not (93:06 - 93:09)
there's not any good venues in milwaukee (93:07 - 93:10)
that (93:09 - 93:12)
that (93:10 - 93:14)
i feel comfortable hosting an art show (93:12 - 93:15)
at (93:14 - 93:18)
uh (93:15 - 93:18)
it's a stallion 13 says travis what's (93:18 - 93:23)
the name of your other podcast (93:21 - 93:26)
arbitrary archive (93:23 - 93:28)
there you go it's all right that was (93:26 - 93:29)
that was (93:28 - 93:32)
that's all right it's a show (93:29 - 93:35)
new episode probably tomorrow i'll edit (93:32 - 93:37)
it tonight (93:35 - 93:39)
uh thai lord (93:37 - 93:42)
asks in chat what do you think (93:39 - 93:43)
the future of pokemon is going to be (93:42 - 93:46)
with the nintendo switch coming out (93:43 - 93:49)
it being a console handheld combo sort (93:46 - 93:51)
of thing could we be seeing a big change (93:49 - 93:53)
in the way games look (93:51 - 93:56)
game play etc (93:53 - 93:56)
not a big change a change back to you (93:57 - 94:02)
single screen gaming the way it used to (93:59 - 94:05)
be back in my day we only had one screen (94:02 - 94:07)
to work with and we were happy with it (94:05 - 94:08)
we just popped our menus up when we (94:07 - 94:10)
needed menus to be up and then the menus (94:08 - 94:13)
went up down when they needed to be down (94:10 - 94:15)
and that's all (94:13 - 94:16)
fine (94:15 - 94:18)
yeah i don't know that it'll (94:16 - 94:20)
be that (94:18 - 94:24)
different the graphical power of a (94:20 - 94:25)
nintendo switch is certainly stronger (94:24 - 94:27)
than that of a 3ds but we're not talking (94:25 - 94:29)
about (94:27 - 94:29)
xbox one or ps4 level hardware right i (94:30 - 94:34)
mean this is (94:33 - 94:35)
what are people saying it's like (94:34 - 94:36)
something like a (94:35 - 94:40)
ps3 or an xbox 360 in terms of graphical (94:36 - 94:41)
power which is you know pretty good for (94:40 - 94:44)
something that can be mobile but (94:41 - 94:47)
i don't think it's i don't think the (94:44 - 94:48)
difference in graphics aren't (94:47 - 94:51)
necessarily going to (94:48 - 94:55)
inspire a vast revolution in gameplay i (94:51 - 94:56)
think it's still going to be pokemon and (94:55 - 94:58)
we've already had a (94:56 - 95:01)
two 3d pokemon games so (94:58 - 95:03)
probably just more of that but a little (95:01 - 95:05)
nicer looking would be my anticipation (95:03 - 95:07)
if you have (95:05 - 95:08)
two (95:07 - 95:11)
3ds's it doesn't matter if it's new old (95:08 - 95:15)
2ds if you but if you have two (95:11 - 95:17)
3ds's in your house (95:15 - 95:19)
and they both have different pokemon (95:17 - 95:23)
games i would encourage you to pull up (95:19 - 95:26)
omega ruby alpha sapphire in one (95:23 - 95:28)
and stand in a pokemon center and then (95:26 - 95:30)
pull up sun and moon on the other and (95:28 - 95:32)
stand in a pokemon center (95:30 - 95:34)
and you will see (95:32 - 95:37)
one of the most dramatical graphical (95:34 - 95:39)
differences between the two games even (95:37 - 95:40)
though they're (95:39 - 95:42)
like two years apart and (95:40 - 95:44)
yeah (95:42 - 95:46)
i would (95:44 - 95:47)
i am (95:46 - 95:51)
very excited if that can only get better (95:47 - 95:53)
uh if it moves the switch like that (95:51 - 95:54)
would (95:53 - 95:57)
be awesome because i don't think (95:54 - 95:58)
even though sun and moon looks (95:57 - 96:00)
significantly better than omega ruby (95:58 - 96:02)
alpha sapphire i still don't think it's (96:00 - 96:03)
it's (96:02 - 96:04)
good enough (96:03 - 96:05)
uh (96:04 - 96:07)
but i would say the same about monster (96:05 - 96:09)
hunter like after seeing monster hunter (96:07 - 96:12)
3u on wii u and then going to like (96:09 - 96:14)
monster hunter 4 or generations on 3ds (96:12 - 96:16)
it's just that (96:14 - 96:18)
in the back of your head going i know (96:16 - 96:22)
how good this cam look (96:18 - 96:26)
and i want that look (96:22 - 96:26)
uh wow there's so many questions (96:28 - 96:31)
everyone's (96:30 - 96:33)
like i'm like scrolling through and (96:31 - 96:36)
people are like annabelle like (96:33 - 96:39)
uh (96:36 - 96:39)
let's do like one or two more i'm really (96:40 - 96:44)
sorry if i like missed your question too (96:42 - 96:46)
by the way (96:44 - 96:48)
um (96:46 - 96:48)
is that the song by um (96:49 - 96:52)
[Music] (96:50 - 96:54)
the guy the murder ballad they called me (96:52 - 96:56)
the wild rose but my name was annabelle (96:54 - 96:57)
lee (96:56 - 97:00)
is that is that the song i like the name (96:57 - 97:02)
yeah (97:00 - 97:05)
i'm a fan of that name uh blsizzle90 (97:02 - 97:08)
says how into pokemon would you be today (97:05 - 97:12)
if you didn't have it super effective (97:08 - 97:12)
that's a really good question it's hard (97:13 - 97:17)
for me (97:15 - 97:19)
hey (97:17 - 97:21)
i mean i probably wouldn't um no because (97:19 - 97:24)
i was doing competitions before i got (97:21 - 97:26)
involved with this crew (97:24 - 97:26)
uh (97:26 - 97:30)
[Music] (97:26 - 97:30)
i'll talk games definitely i'll tell a (97:30 - 97:35)
story um i might have told this before (97:32 - 97:39)
but uh maybe maybe i haven't but (97:35 - 97:41)
when (97:39 - 97:43)
i got back to back into pokemon it was (97:41 - 97:45)
diamond and pearl (97:43 - 97:46)
and (97:45 - 97:49)
i have nothing can (97:46 - 97:49)
i had a friend who talked me into (97:49 - 97:53)
getting back into pokemon because i fell (97:51 - 97:56)
out uh as as everyone knows i fell out (97:53 - 97:58)
during uh ruby and sapphire (97:56 - 98:00)
and (97:58 - 98:02)
so he talked me into getting diamond and (98:00 - 98:05)
pearl and i thought okay like (98:02 - 98:07)
and again this was a long time ago i was (98:05 - 98:09)
like okay like i'm getting this kid's (98:07 - 98:11)
game but i'm doing it with a friend and (98:09 - 98:13)
even though that it's it's silly and (98:11 - 98:14)
probably not for us (98:13 - 98:18)
uh it it should just be fun that we're (98:14 - 98:20)
playing this game together and (98:18 - 98:22)
my mindset was i remember playing red (98:20 - 98:23)
and blue with my sister when i was like (98:22 - 98:26)
10 years old and that was like that was (98:23 - 98:27)
a very (98:26 - 98:31)
fond and strong childhood memory so for (98:27 - 98:33)
39.95 to do that again with with a (98:31 - 98:37)
friend i was living with uh that seems (98:33 - 98:39)
to be that seems to be worth the the (98:37 - 98:40)
price of admission (98:39 - 98:42)
and (98:40 - 98:45)
i got i was very into diamond and pearl (98:42 - 98:48)
at the time i went back i played fire (98:45 - 98:50)
red and leaf green i played uh ruby and (98:48 - 98:52)
sapphire from start to finish (98:50 - 98:55)
uh after that and my friend fell off (98:52 - 98:57)
probably halfway through uh (98:55 - 98:58)
diamond i think (98:57 - 99:01)
they got (98:58 - 99:04)
fast forward to a couple years later (99:01 - 99:06)
and (99:04 - 99:08)
so heart gold and soul silver were (99:06 - 99:09)
coming out (99:08 - 99:10)
and (99:09 - 99:12)
that there was a year or two that passed (99:10 - 99:13)
where you know i didn't really think (99:12 - 99:16)
about pokemon at all (99:13 - 99:17)
and (99:16 - 99:19)
aaron as as (99:17 - 99:23)
older older listeners might know uh was (99:19 - 99:25)
the one that talked me into getting (99:23 - 99:26)
pokemon at the time i don't know if i've (99:25 - 99:28)
ever said that but it was like hey we (99:26 - 99:30)
should get the new pokemon games and i (99:28 - 99:32)
was like oh i (99:30 - 99:34)
did like i i honestly didn't even know (99:32 - 99:36)
they were coming out at the time (99:34 - 99:37)
and (99:36 - 99:39)
i was like yeah that sure like that that (99:37 - 99:42)
seems fun again that reminded me of when (99:39 - 99:43)
diamond pro came out (99:42 - 99:46)
39.95 price of admission for us to like (99:43 - 99:47)
play this for the entire weekend (99:46 - 99:49)
together and then never think of it (99:47 - 99:50)
again (99:49 - 99:51)
and (99:50 - 99:52)
when (99:51 - 99:54)
uh (99:52 - 99:56)
heart cold soul silver came out we went (99:54 - 99:58)
to a game stop at 8 a.m i think they had (99:56 - 99:59)
a (99:58 - 100:01)
early open right because gamestop (99:59 - 100:04)
normally opens at 10 and so we got (100:01 - 100:07)
heart gold soul silver and we sat on my (100:04 - 100:09)
couch and we watched documentaries on (100:07 - 100:10)
netflix (100:09 - 100:11)
all day (100:10 - 100:13)
and played (100:11 - 100:15)
heart gold soul silver (100:13 - 100:17)
this is blowing my mind did i a scene (100:15 - 100:19)
really not exist until after heart gold (100:17 - 100:20)
and soul silver came out yup yeah it (100:19 - 100:24)
existed after heart gold saul silver so (100:20 - 100:26)
at the time i was listening to a weekly (100:24 - 100:29)
gaming podcast uh from 1up.com which no (100:26 - 100:31)
longer exists uh (100:29 - 100:32)
and (100:31 - 100:35)
i was very like very excited for them to (100:32 - 100:36)
talk about pokemon because they always (100:35 - 100:38)
talk about what they've been playing and (100:36 - 100:39)
they they skipped pokemon they didn't (100:38 - 100:41)
talk about it and then the next week (100:39 - 100:42)
they they skipped pokemon they didn't (100:41 - 100:45)
talk about it and then (100:42 - 100:47)
i was like i want to hear like i was a (100:45 - 100:48)
very into podcast at the time i want to (100:47 - 100:50)
hear somebody talk about pokemon and no (100:48 - 100:52)
one no one on that show did and finally (100:50 - 100:53)
i i (100:52 - 100:55)
looked for pokemon podcast that i found (100:53 - 100:57)
a couple and you know most didn't do an (100:55 - 101:00)
episode in quite a while and i i told (100:57 - 101:02)
the podcast i did find which was by (101:00 - 101:03)
games radar (101:02 - 101:05)
uh was pokemon monday and i listened to (101:03 - 101:08)
that and and it was fine it was good uh (101:05 - 101:09)
and then i decided like hey i should i (101:08 - 101:13)
should start my own podcast because uh (101:09 - 101:15)
there's not that many out there and i (101:13 - 101:16)
feel like i know pokemon pretty well at (101:15 - 101:18)
the (101:16 - 101:20)
surprise i don't uh (101:18 - 101:21)
listen to this (101:20 - 101:23)
you guys all know way more than i do (101:21 - 101:26)
but that's okay (101:23 - 101:26)
but i (101:27 - 101:31)
even even (101:29 - 101:33)
i will say this even (101:31 - 101:37)
if sometimes i (101:33 - 101:37)
when there have been moments where i (101:37 - 101:40)
thought about like throwing in the towel (101:39 - 101:42)
with the show (101:40 - 101:42)
or (101:42 - 101:43)
[Music] (101:42 - 101:47)
taking some time off with the podcast or (101:43 - 101:49)
for example when pokemon conquest came (101:47 - 101:50)
out i didn't play that at all i bought (101:49 - 101:52)
it i have it it's on my shelf i've (101:50 - 101:54)
played maybe 10 minutes of it (101:52 - 101:56)
it's fun (101:54 - 101:59)
yeah it's it's fine even with all those (101:56 - 102:00)
moments (101:59 - 102:02)
up to that point (102:00 - 102:05)
like it's so hard for me not to (102:02 - 102:07)
like pokemon or smile about pokemon when (102:05 - 102:08)
i see (102:07 - 102:10)
like a new plush on the shelf at target (102:08 - 102:12)
or when i'm flipping through (102:10 - 102:13)
uh (102:12 - 102:15)
netflix or hulu and i see pokemon come (102:13 - 102:16)
up and i turn on an episode like that (102:15 - 102:19)
like there's besides just the game even (102:16 - 102:20)
if i'm burnt out with the game there's (102:19 - 102:23)
so many other outlets to pokemon that (102:20 - 102:25)
make it enjoyable for me to like slowly (102:23 - 102:27)
brings me back into like i was burnt out (102:25 - 102:29)
when omega ruby and (102:27 - 102:32)
omega ruby alpha sapphire came out like (102:29 - 102:34)
i was i just wasn't in the mood to play (102:32 - 102:36)
a pokemon game but that doesn't like i (102:34 - 102:38)
didn't stop liking pokemon i just didn't (102:36 - 102:40)
feel like going through a (102:38 - 102:43)
a really bad version of of generation (102:40 - 102:45)
three (102:43 - 102:45)
generation three is not that bad (102:47 - 102:52)
too much water (102:50 - 102:52)
i (102:52 - 102:54)
might as i said before my new year's or (102:52 - 102:56)
maybe i just tweeted it my new year's (102:54 - 102:58)
resolution is to not get into arguments (102:56 - 103:00)
about generation three so i will not say (102:58 - 103:02)
anything um (103:00 - 103:03)
gracefully abstain (103:02 - 103:05)
yep (103:03 - 103:08)
i've you know i have a similar story to (103:05 - 103:10)
steve i didn't fall out for gen 3 i (103:08 - 103:12)
played that game (103:10 - 103:14)
but (103:12 - 103:17)
it took some convincing for my (103:14 - 103:19)
on my brother's behalf for him to (103:17 - 103:22)
convince me to buy diamond and pearl and (103:19 - 103:23)
then i did and i was right back in and (103:22 - 103:25)
hooked and especially after her golden (103:23 - 103:27)
soul silver came out those games were (103:25 - 103:31)
incredible i would just say that (103:27 - 103:32)
and because of that i think i wouldn't (103:31 - 103:34)
have fallen off pokemon again because (103:32 - 103:37)
they haven't really released (103:34 - 103:40)
a lot of bad games since then i mean i (103:37 - 103:43)
have my opinions like i think black 2 (103:40 - 103:45)
and white 2 and omega ruby and alpha (103:43 - 103:47)
sapphire weren't as strong as some of (103:45 - 103:48)
the other games that were releasing (103:47 - 103:50)
around that time but generally those (103:48 - 103:52)
games are still good so i don't think i (103:50 - 103:54)
would have fallen off (103:52 - 103:55)
but (103:54 - 103:58)
i would say two things about what this (103:55 - 103:59)
show has done in reference to my (103:58 - 104:01)
enjoyment of pokemon the first is just (103:59 - 104:02)
that (104:01 - 104:05)
the amount of people it has (104:02 - 104:08)
allowed me to meet who are (104:05 - 104:11)
so on fire for pokemon has made me (104:08 - 104:12)
love it more i wouldn't have met all (104:11 - 104:14)
these people i would have just had my (104:12 - 104:15)
brother and a few friends from high (104:14 - 104:17)
school that were into pokemon for me to (104:15 - 104:20)
play with so giving me a large number of (104:17 - 104:21)
people who (104:20 - 104:24)
enjoy the same hobby as i do is (104:21 - 104:26)
obviously makes it more enjoyable and (104:24 - 104:28)
then i think (104:26 - 104:31)
doing this show every week (104:28 - 104:32)
meant that (104:31 - 104:34)
i never (104:32 - 104:37)
really took a break from pokemon like i (104:34 - 104:39)
might have after like (104:37 - 104:41)
there are some points where there (104:39 - 104:43)
haven't been a new game in a very long (104:41 - 104:46)
time um and i think if this show hadn't (104:43 - 104:47)
existed i probably just wouldn't be (104:46 - 104:49)
thinking about pokemon until the new (104:47 - 104:50)
game came out but (104:49 - 104:52)
that doesn't happen when you're talking (104:50 - 104:55)
about pokemon these every week (104:52 - 104:55)
is will asleep your eyes are like close (104:55 - 105:01)
both both our stories just you can't put (104:58 - 105:02)
out you put them in the see them with my (105:01 - 105:06)
glasses it's just they're not closed (105:02 - 105:06)
all right (105:06 - 105:10)
well do you have a sad story or no (105:08 - 105:13)
sad story i have always enjoyed playing (105:10 - 105:14)
pokemon yeah i probably wouldn't have (105:13 - 105:17)
gotten as deep into the competitive (105:14 - 105:19)
stuff without all the internet people (105:17 - 105:22)
that have helped me with that so there (105:19 - 105:24)
you i mean the fundamentally i wouldn't (105:22 - 105:25)
have been as deep (105:24 - 105:27)
yeah yeah (105:25 - 105:29)
all right well let's (105:27 - 105:31)
do some giveaways here (105:29 - 105:32)
some of you are still hanging out so (105:31 - 105:35)
that's awesome thank you for i figured (105:32 - 105:36)
this was going to be about two hours (105:35 - 105:38)
long we started we started a little bit (105:36 - 105:41)
late uh travis i'll have travis prep the (105:38 - 105:43)
pokemon of the week here uh and as he (105:41 - 105:46)
does that we'll do (105:43 - 105:48)
oh he's ready we'll do some giveaways i (105:46 - 105:50)
don't know how this works (105:48 - 105:51)
uh (105:50 - 105:53)
micah who has been moderating the chat (105:51 - 105:55)
is on along with tyler they're they're (105:53 - 105:57)
there so i'm gonna hit this open button (105:55 - 106:00)
and i think if you type in (105:57 - 106:02)
raffle (106:00 - 106:05)
in chat (106:02 - 106:07)
if i spelt it right (106:05 - 106:10)
that would be a thing (106:07 - 106:10)
that should put people in the raffle (106:11 - 106:16)
uh i entered myself in the raffle uh by (106:14 - 106:19)
doing that so hopefully uh if if my (106:16 - 106:21)
account comes up and wins i'll just (106:19 - 106:23)
redraw (106:21 - 106:25)
yeah so we'll do (106:23 - 106:26)
a giveaway for that it'll be like (106:25 - 106:28)
stickers and magnets uh i don't have any (106:26 - 106:31)
stickers on me they're they're stickers (106:28 - 106:33)
snickers stickers (106:31 - 106:35)
magnets (106:33 - 106:35)
they uh (106:36 - 106:41)
like i said i have magnets here (106:38 - 106:43)
or coasters they're definitely magnets i (106:41 - 106:45)
don't have any stickers on my desk and i (106:43 - 106:46)
don't really (106:45 - 106:49)
i don't want to get up i mean i have (106:46 - 106:51)
no i don't (106:49 - 106:54)
trust me i do have stickers and stuff uh (106:51 - 106:55)
so (106:54 - 106:58)
those will be in so uh we'll draw that (106:55 - 106:59)
so you guys can enter (106:58 - 107:01)
and uh i'll let i'll try to find my (106:59 - 107:03)
stickers actually uh (107:01 - 107:05)
but i'll let travis run down our pokemon (107:03 - 107:06)
of the week right now (107:05 - 107:08)
alright our pokemon of the week is (107:06 - 107:11)
marowak specifically alolan marowak (107:08 - 107:12)
because (107:11 - 107:15)
you can only use pokemon that are (107:12 - 107:18)
obtainable within sun and moon in (107:15 - 107:20)
the vgc format so we're going to do a (107:18 - 107:23)
lowland marowak here one of the most (107:20 - 107:25)
popular pokemon in the format right now (107:23 - 107:29)
mostly because it tracks a lot of (107:25 - 107:32)
popular pokemon notably celestiala and (107:29 - 107:35)
tapu coco especially top of (107:32 - 107:37)
coco the moveset we're going to use (107:35 - 107:40)
comes to us from slow bro trainer (107:37 - 107:42)
brandon in our pokemon of the week slack (107:40 - 107:44)
channel your item is going to be thick (107:42 - 107:45)
club which is an item (107:44 - 107:48)
that specifically (107:45 - 107:50)
increases the attack of marowak the (107:48 - 107:52)
ability and this is where things deviate (107:50 - 107:54)
a little bit from the standard set the (107:52 - 107:56)
ability is going to be rockhead which (107:54 - 108:00)
prevents damage from recoil the evs are (107:56 - 108:04)
going to be 252 in attack and 252 in hp (108:00 - 108:06)
with the four remaining in defense with (108:04 - 108:08)
an adamant nature the moves will be (108:06 - 108:11)
flare blitz shadow bone bone meringue (108:08 - 108:13)
and double edge (108:11 - 108:16)
taking advantage of rock had four flare (108:13 - 108:19)
blitz and double edge (108:16 - 108:22)
marowak is quite useful because with (108:19 - 108:23)
bone meringue (108:22 - 108:26)
it can one shot (108:23 - 108:27)
tapu coco which is (108:26 - 108:30)
very good to do because the second most (108:27 - 108:32)
popular pokemon in the format and (108:30 - 108:34)
because it's a move that hits twice it (108:32 - 108:36)
doesn't matter if they're using a focus (108:34 - 108:40)
sash which toppo coco often (108:36 - 108:42)
will flair blitz is there because you (108:40 - 108:45)
want a strong fire type (108:42 - 108:48)
move and it also can ko cela stila which (108:45 - 108:51)
is a tricky pokemon to take out if you (108:48 - 108:52)
don't have something specifically to (108:51 - 108:55)
counter it shadow bone another good uh (108:52 - 108:58)
same type attack bonus move to have and (108:55 - 109:01)
then double edges in there uh just for (108:58 - 109:03)
some coverage in case (109:01 - 109:05)
the pokemon resists your other moves and (109:03 - 109:07)
it takes advantage of rockhead (109:05 - 109:09)
as well (109:07 - 109:10)
um (109:09 - 109:12)
the (109:10 - 109:14)
more common set for alolan marowak is (109:12 - 109:17)
going to be with the lightning rod (109:14 - 109:19)
ability and the reason you'd have that (109:17 - 109:21)
is because (109:19 - 109:22)
even though (109:21 - 109:25)
alolan marowak it's can just on its own (109:22 - 109:27)
pretty much counter tapu coco the (109:25 - 109:29)
ability to prevent it because taboo (109:27 - 109:32)
cocoa outspeeds marowak the ability to (109:29 - 109:34)
prevent it from using (109:32 - 109:36)
electric moves at all is very helpful (109:34 - 109:38)
especially if you're pairing (109:36 - 109:43)
alolan marowak with a water type pokemon (109:38 - 109:45)
so you can send out a water type pokemon (109:43 - 109:46)
even if you think they're going to send (109:45 - 109:49)
that topu coco or another electric type (109:46 - 109:51)
if you have a marowak with lightning rod (109:49 - 109:54)
there because lightning rod will take (109:51 - 109:56)
that electric type move and increase (109:54 - 109:58)
alolan marowak special attack dealing no (109:56 - 110:00)
damage although you're not really going (109:58 - 110:02)
to take advantage of that special attack (110:00 - 110:04)
increase (110:02 - 110:06)
the only exception is if the pokemon (110:04 - 110:07)
uses a move (110:06 - 110:10)
like well specifically discharge because (110:07 - 110:12)
then a little marowak won't take damage (110:10 - 110:14)
but your partner pokemon will as (110:12 - 110:15)
discharge hits (110:14 - 110:18)
all of the pokemon (110:15 - 110:20)
on the field (110:18 - 110:22)
and the more common set is only slightly (110:20 - 110:24)
different instead of double edge you run (110:22 - 110:25)
protect (110:24 - 110:27)
but shadow bone flare blitz and bone (110:25 - 110:29)
meringue still get used you still use (110:27 - 110:31)
thick club it's pretty much the only (110:29 - 110:33)
item you would use on marowak because (110:31 - 110:36)
it's it's specific item (110:33 - 110:37)
and (110:36 - 110:43)
uh a lot of sets are the 252 in hp and (110:37 - 110:44)
attack um (110:43 - 110:46)
there's some difference (110:44 - 110:48)
here and there if if people are only (110:46 - 110:50)
putting enough evs (110:48 - 110:54)
in there to be able to ko cela stila i (110:50 - 110:55)
think (110:54 - 110:56)
someone in the slack chat mentioned that (110:55 - 110:58)
yeah (110:56 - 111:00)
um (110:58 - 111:00)
brandon weisner says you only need 172 (111:02 - 111:08)
evs in attack if you're doing the (111:07 - 111:10)
adamant nature to be able to one at ko (111:08 - 111:12)
stella stila so if that's mainly what (111:10 - 111:14)
you're worried about you could also (111:12 - 111:16)
build an ev spread that gives you a (111:14 - 111:18)
little more bulk or maybe a little more (111:16 - 111:19)
speed if you want to out speed a (111:18 - 111:21)
specific thing but sometimes you don't (111:19 - 111:23)
want to do that because marowak can be a (111:21 - 111:25)
good check to trickroom teams because (111:23 - 111:27)
it's not that fast (111:25 - 111:30)
on its own i think i said most of the (111:27 - 111:33)
things right did i do it did i do good (111:30 - 111:36)
yeah i mean i was setting up a raffle (111:33 - 111:37)

shiny oh (113:37 - 113:42)
shiny marowak you drop the ball (113:38 - 113:45)
uh shiny marowak is green instead of tan (113:42 - 113:48)
looks like its skull is uh is the same (113:45 - 113:50)
color (113:48 - 113:50)
but (113:51 - 113:55)
what about shiny alolan marijuana yeah (113:53 - 113:58)
it doesn't show it on bulbapedia (113:55 - 114:00)
which is come on (113:58 - 114:00)
i don't know (114:00 - 114:04)
thanks bulbapedia (114:02 - 114:07)
some trivia in pokemon red blue beta (114:04 - 114:12)
marowak was known as gard guardia (114:07 - 114:15)
garadua the spanish word for guardian so (114:12 - 114:17)
yeah i'm probably saying that wrong (114:15 - 114:20)
according to some marowak generation two (114:17 - 114:22)
and four pokedex entries somewhere (114:20 - 114:25)
exists a legendary marowak graveyard (114:22 - 114:26)
this is a reference to an elephant's (114:25 - 114:29)
graveyard of modern myth (114:26 - 114:31)
that's pretty cool (114:29 - 114:31)
and what else do we have here until the (114:33 - 114:38)
release of pokemon black and white 2 (114:36 - 114:40)
the appearance of black and white curio (114:38 - 114:42)
marowak is the only pokemon in main (114:40 - 114:44)
games to be found in a location where (114:42 - 114:48)
it's not able to be caught at all (114:44 - 114:53)
which i think was in the lavender tower (114:48 - 114:53)
all right (114:56 - 114:58)
wait i i was looking i was trying to (114:59 - 115:02)
look at what alolan (115:01 - 115:05)
shiny is so i didn't i wasn't paying (115:02 - 115:06)
attention to you and i i'm pretty sure (115:05 - 115:08)
it was lavender tower and final tidbit (115:06 - 115:10)
here is alolan marowak is the only dual (115:08 - 115:12)
type pokemon with its pre-evolutions (115:10 - 115:16)
that share no types with it (115:12 - 115:20)
so there we go (115:16 - 115:20)
uh (115:21 - 115:23)
yeah people seem to really like alolan (115:23 - 115:27)
marowak (115:25 - 115:29)
because it's cool (115:27 - 115:33)
oh no i mean it's it's it's cool i (115:29 - 115:36)
it's all right other like uh fire ghost (115:33 - 115:40)
type pokemon just look like garbage (115:36 - 115:40)
shiny a little and marowak is purple (115:42 - 115:46)
i'm like going through and like (115:45 - 115:49)

wrestling (119:53 - 119:56)

the royal rumble (119:56 - 120:00)
is the best way to start watching (119:58 - 120:01)
wrestling (120:00 - 120:04)
because it's one of the silliest (120:01 - 120:06)
and most fun (120:04 - 120:09)
matches you can ever watch (120:06 - 120:10)
uh (120:09 - 120:11)
is it the only way to keep sending in (120:10 - 120:13)
like a new person every five minutes or (120:11 - 120:14)
something no (120:13 - 120:17)
yeah it's a it's a 30-man match and (120:14 - 120:19)
every 90 seconds they send in a new (120:17 - 120:21)
wrestler and if you get thrown over the (120:19 - 120:23)
top rope you're eliminated the last (120:21 - 120:27)
wrestler in the match uh (120:23 - 120:30)
wins the match and they go on to (120:27 - 120:33)
uh get a championship match so it's it's (120:30 - 120:36)
a big match uh but it's really great for (120:33 - 120:37)
anyone who's not into wrestling because (120:36 - 120:40)
you see 30 different wrestlers within an (120:37 - 120:40)
hour (120:40 - 120:44)
