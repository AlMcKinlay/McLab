[Music] (0:02 - 0:23)
what's up everyone welcome to the 270 (0:20 - 0:26)
seventh episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:23 - 0:30)
it's super effective I'm your host SBJ (0:26 - 0:34)
and with me today is will yeah and I (0:30 - 0:37)
think I'm under the realization that the (0:34 - 0:40)
the hour of 4:00 a.m. and the age of 44 (0:37 - 0:46)
are yet not compatible I should never (0:40 - 0:50)
see that hour with my open eyes we we (0:46 - 0:52)
both had late nights but we were we were (0:50 - 0:54)
not together that's true I actually (0:52 - 0:58)
think when I woke up at 6:30 you're like (0:54 - 1:00)
you had just texted me or something and (0:58 - 1:03)
you're like yeah I just got home yeah (1:00 - 1:04)
yeah (1:03 - 1:06)
so we're we're recording this no Travis (1:04 - 1:09)
uh just because of this weird recording (1:06 - 1:12)
schedule I just got back from the (1:09 - 1:15)
Minnesota polka con just a bit ago I (1:12 - 1:18)
mean I mean I got home at like it was (1:15 - 1:21)
probably like five ish a.m. before I (1:18 - 1:24)
climbed into bed it's like 4 p.m. now so (1:21 - 1:25)
I slept for like 10 hours because I (1:24 - 1:27)
didn't sleep at all during that (1:25 - 1:31)
convention and then so how long when did (1:27 - 1:33)
you get there because you you don't live (1:31 - 1:35)
in Minnesota for those that I don't know (1:33 - 1:38)
hopes who don't know yeah so the (1:35 - 1:41)
Minnesota polka con was in st. Louis (1:38 - 1:44)
Park Minnesota if I'm not mistaken I (1:41 - 1:45)
could prob maybe I'm getting the city (1:44 - 1:47)
wrong but around st. Louis Park (1:45 - 1:50)
Minnesota and they invited my they (1:47 - 1:54)
invited us out about two weeks ago so (1:50 - 1:57)
very last-minute on on their part and my (1:54 - 1:59)
part and I was like okay I can at least (1:57 - 2:01)
do Saturday if that's okay with you guys (1:59 - 2:03)
and they said sure and they were like (2:01 - 2:07)
we'll give you a booth at a table or a (2:03 - 2:08)
booth in Taylor the same thing but we'll (2:07 - 2:10)
give you a booth and we'll give you a (2:08 - 2:13)
panel that's like cool great I mean it's (2:10 - 2:16)
a it's like a six-hour drive for me and (2:13 - 2:17)
Michael is like oh I'd love to go with (2:16 - 2:23)
and Greg from mythical mythical he lives (2:17 - 2:25)
near st. Louis Park so it's very easy (2:23 - 2:28)
commute for him giving giving away (2:25 - 2:31)
people's locations anyways so my god (2:28 - 2:33)
Mike and I left (2:31 - 2:37)
Friday at about 11 a.m. and we have that (2:33 - 2:39)
we haven't taken my cash err a hotel (2:37 - 2:39)
room (2:39 - 2:45)
no so Irene's brother also lives in st. (2:39 - 2:48)
Louis Park Wow (2:45 - 2:49)
I originally was going to book a hotel (2:48 - 2:51)
room but Irene was like just text my (2:49 - 2:53)
brother so I did and they're like oh of (2:51 - 2:55)
course you can stay with us so and they (2:53 - 2:56)
have two guest bedrooms (2:55 - 3:00)
believe it or not Wow I know it's C R if (2:56 - 3:02)
it was were very fancy and so we stayed (3:00 - 3:05)
with them and that was a huge help with (3:02 - 3:08)
just cost of getting there and arranging (3:05 - 3:12)
everything and so we get in around 6 (3:08 - 3:15)
p.m. ish not actually was clip maybe (3:12 - 3:18)
closer to 7:00 we meet up with Greg (3:15 - 3:20)
right away we go to the the hotel where (3:18 - 3:21)
it was taking place it was the (3:20 - 3:24)
Doubletree and like I said I think it's (3:21 - 3:25)
st. Louis Park so we went to the (3:24 - 3:27)
Doubletree in st. Louis Park walked (3:25 - 3:29)
around we met everyone we met people (3:27 - 3:33)
from the decks and we met the person who (3:29 - 3:35)
created Pokemon showdown like the (3:33 - 3:37)
programmer person the programmer person (3:35 - 3:41)
they also live in or around st. Louis (3:37 - 3:44)
Park who knew so I guess the st. Louis (3:41 - 3:45)
Park is is really near Minneapolis right (3:44 - 3:46)
yes (3:45 - 3:50)
so Minneapolis is the hub of Pokemon (3:46 - 3:52)
culture in the United States of America (3:50 - 3:55)
is what we're determining I mean the (3:52 - 3:57)
person who runs the event said that the (3:55 - 3:59)
Pokemon scene isn't strong in Minnesota (3:57 - 4:01)
I'm not sure if that's like true or not (3:59 - 4:03)
I mean I don't live there so I'll take (4:01 - 4:06)
their word on it but their goal with the (4:03 - 4:09)
Minnesota polka cotton is to you know (4:06 - 4:11)
restore that and bring that up and make (4:09 - 4:14)
that you know a more popular thing so we (4:11 - 4:15)
met with all those guys and they were (4:14 - 4:16)
they were having like a staff slash (4:15 - 4:20)
group dinner I was like hey guys it was (4:16 - 4:22)
super nice to meet all you I'm gonna (4:20 - 4:23)
spend the entire day with you guys (4:22 - 4:26)
tomorrow I would love to see my friends (4:23 - 4:28)
that also live in st. Louis Park my (4:26 - 4:31)
friend Alex and his girlfriend Katie I (4:28 - 4:33)
was like I see them like twice a year so (4:31 - 4:35)
I will see you guys all tomorrow but I'm (4:33 - 4:38)
gonna cook at dinner with them that's (4:35 - 4:38)
reasonable (4:38 - 4:40)
yeah I think so so we got dinner with (4:38 - 4:44)
with my friends then Mike and I (4:40 - 4:46)
attempted to do the splatfest we (4:44 - 4:50)
was a complete disaster because the as (4:46 - 4:52)
nice as my my Irene's brothers house is (4:50 - 4:55)
it's like a dead spot for 18 t so I (4:52 - 4:58)
couldn't tell oh wow like I could I (4:55 - 5:00)
could I could lo Twitter and everything (4:58 - 5:01)
just fine it just wasn't strong enough (5:00 - 5:03)
to play an online game on your Nintendo (5:01 - 5:05)
switch that you could portably take with (5:03 - 5:09)
you to direct in the pre first world (5:05 - 5:11)
problems right there Micah had a Verizon (5:09 - 5:14)
hot spot so we paid the $35 for like two (5:11 - 5:17)
gigs of data and we played like 10 (5:14 - 5:18)
matches a splatfest it was like 3:00 (5:17 - 5:20)
a.m. and then we had to get ready for (5:18 - 5:23)
the con which started at 10:00 we went (5:20 - 5:26)
to the conned at 10:00 and there was a (5:23 - 5:29)
couple issues I know you probably have (5:26 - 5:31)
questions will but the the main issue (5:29 - 5:33)
that happened was the registration (5:31 - 5:36)
portal didn't work so for my (5:33 - 5:37)
understanding they couldn't actually (5:36 - 5:39)
pull up who registered and who didn't (5:37 - 5:42)
register so they I got that resolved (5:39 - 5:46)
around 11:30 wait wait wait wait wait so (5:42 - 5:49)
they didn't use I'm not gonna say (5:46 - 5:50)
Ticketmaster because that would be (5:49 - 5:51)
foolish for them to use but they didn't (5:50 - 5:54)
use Eventbrite no I don't think so (5:51 - 5:58)
hey hey folks just FYI event brights (5:54 - 5:59)
already done all the work for you just (5:58 - 6:03)
use Eventbrite alright not not a (5:59 - 6:06)
sponsored the program but not yeah will (6:03 - 6:09)
anderson gold-certified recommendation (6:06 - 6:12)
right there not yet I actually think I (6:09 - 6:13)
could be wrong but I'm pretty sure I (6:12 - 6:15)
heard I can't remember his name I'm (6:13 - 6:17)
apologized but the creator of showdown (6:15 - 6:21)
I'm pretty sure helped program the (6:17 - 6:24)
Minnesota Polka Khan website out here (6:21 - 6:28)
I mean clearly the dude knows how to (6:24 - 6:31)
program he made Pokemon yeah but (6:28 - 6:34)
registration had some issues what was (6:31 - 6:35)
supposed to happen is it was supposed to (6:34 - 6:36)
open at 10:00 and then opening (6:35 - 6:39)
ceremonies was supposed to be a 10:30 (6:36 - 6:42)
people started pouring in around 11:30 (6:39 - 6:46)
and then the opening ceremonies was at (6:42 - 6:48)
12:00 and when we got in we got in at (6:46 - 6:49)
like 9:30 because I was like I don't (6:48 - 6:52)
need I don't need like an hour two hours (6:49 - 6:54)
to set up my table I've done so many (6:52 - 6:57)
cons in the past packs mgc yeah you (6:54 - 6:59)
pretty much just have like a booth in a (6:57 - 7:00)
box at this point (6:59 - 7:02)
I D I literally do have a booth in a box (7:00 - 7:07)
yes and I drove so I was very limited in (7:02 - 7:08)
what I could bring like I could probably (7:07 - 7:11)
could have brought more stuff but I was (7:08 - 7:13)
like I'm just gonna bring my one box you (7:11 - 7:15)
know go from there what was really cool (7:13 - 7:18)
is so we we were one of the first people (7:15 - 7:20)
to set up a table so this is it was (7:18 - 7:23)
organized like when you walk in there's (7:20 - 7:25)
just really wide hallway and it was (7:23 - 7:27)
really long and that's where all the (7:25 - 7:30)
either featured guests were or sponsors (7:27 - 7:32)
like sprint was there because Sprint is (7:30 - 7:34)
a sponsor of Pokemon go so I assume that (7:32 - 7:36)
the poky con worked with them and said (7:34 - 7:38)
hey we're gonna poke my people here your (7:36 - 7:40)
sprint your big part Pokemon go just (7:38 - 7:41)
like something it was like sprint was (7:40 - 7:43)
there we set up in the hallway and then (7:41 - 7:45)
at the end of the hallway was the main (7:43 - 7:47)
hall where they would do opening (7:45 - 7:49)
ceremonies in the concert and then next (7:47 - 7:51)
to that was the vendor slash artists (7:49 - 7:55)
room and then mid look right when you (7:51 - 7:57)
walk in there was two rooms four panels (7:55 - 8:00)
and then in the middle of this long (7:57 - 8:02)
hallway on either side one room was (8:00 - 8:04)
dedicated to showing Pokemon movies and (8:02 - 8:06)
then across from that was like the game (8:04 - 8:09)
room where people were either doing the (8:06 - 8:11)
video game or the TCG or they just had (8:09 - 8:13)
like pokemon monopoly or Pokemon (8:11 - 8:17)
adventure quest to be a master or event (8:13 - 8:19)
request that really old board game so (8:17 - 8:20)
that was you know pretty much the whole (8:19 - 8:23)
like floor plan of the con it was easily (8:20 - 8:25)
the smallest kind I've been to but it (8:23 - 8:27)
was so I was gonna say how many how many (8:25 - 8:30)
people would you say total just Saturday (8:27 - 8:31)
cuz again the con was both Saturday and (8:30 - 8:35)
Sunday I would say that about two to (8:31 - 8:38)
three hundred people poured in right (8:35 - 8:42)
away around the the opening first (8:38 - 8:44)
opening two hours and then throughout (8:42 - 8:46)
the day new people were coming in but (8:44 - 8:48)
also people were leaving and then coming (8:46 - 8:49)
back I'm assuming that a lot of people (8:48 - 8:52)
were staying in the hotel so it was like (8:49 - 8:53)
okay we saw this stuff but we're gonna (8:52 - 8:55)
you know go back to our hotel room or go (8:53 - 8:57)
get something come back for a panel I (8:55 - 8:59)
think they were expected five hundred (8:57 - 9:02)
people so I would I I'm pretty confident (8:59 - 9:04)
they'd probably hit that especially with (9:02 - 9:07)
Sunday all right Pisan yeah five hundred (9:04 - 9:09)
people's decent I mean if five hundred (9:07 - 9:11)
people who love Pokemon which is pretty (9:09 - 9:13)
cool what was even cooler (9:11 - 9:17)
will is I we set up the table and I like (9:13 - 9:19)
left to I went back to my car to get (9:17 - 9:22)
some more stuff and when I came back (9:19 - 9:24)
Professor Oak (9:22 - 9:27)
set up their table next to us so like (9:24 - 9:31)
the actual professor oak the the og the (9:27 - 9:33)
original voice actor for professor oak (9:31 - 9:39)
for the first nine years of the anime (9:33 - 9:42)
that's cool either so they soon actually (9:39 - 9:45)
had some real like people from from the (9:42 - 9:48)
Pokemon world there yeah I got him to (9:45 - 9:51)
get getting there to the the middle of (9:48 - 9:54)
America which people like us me from the (9:51 - 9:56)
coast don't like to believe exists but (9:54 - 9:59)
sure so they had they had the original (9:56 - 10:01)
voice actor Professor Oak's Stewart (9:59 - 10:05)
something Patrick Stewart yes Patrick (10:01 - 10:07)
Stewart was the original voice actor (10:05 - 10:12)
they had Jason Page who was the singer (10:07 - 10:17)
of the original Pokemon theme song oh (10:12 - 10:23)
wow the I want to be the very best that (10:17 - 10:26)
song that's a pretty it's almost a Bop (10:23 - 10:28)
not not quite I'm trying to pick up the (10:26 - 10:30)
new lingo I heard that on a different (10:28 - 10:32)
podcast so you refer to as a Bob yeah (10:30 - 10:35)
the Bob yeah it's it's a Yuri ah nice as (10:32 - 10:38)
a Bop supposedly I think it's about and (10:35 - 10:40)
that's what that's what qualifies right (10:38 - 10:42)
when I born I put down the BOP hammer (10:40 - 10:47)
actually no but anyways they had the Dex (10:42 - 10:51)
the YouTube channel they had us the same (10:47 - 10:55)
level of Jason page and Professor Oak's (10:51 - 10:57)
no no no I died degree a degree that we (10:55 - 10:59)
we hit that level we're more big in the (10:57 - 11:01)
community I'm just just to give you some (10:59 - 11:03)
perspective on that I was hanging out (11:01 - 11:06)
with one of Steven wise merch you chew (11:03 - 11:09)
already can and he was in DC for a (11:06 - 11:11)
conference and everybody was saying well (11:09 - 11:13)
how do you know will and I would just (11:11 - 11:17)
say I'm a famous internet personality (11:13 - 11:17)
and then then the guy who created show (11:18 - 11:25)
down and I think there was one more (11:23 - 11:26)
other person (11:25 - 11:29)
and I can't remember what they did I (11:26 - 11:32)
want to say or a programmer / author of (11:29 - 11:34)
sorts but I'm not a hundred percent sure (11:32 - 11:37)
what they did and I apologize we talked (11:34 - 11:40)
with Professor Oak such one of the (11:37 - 11:42)
nicest dudes I think I've ever talked to (11:40 - 11:45)
the ability for him to talk normal and (11:42 - 11:48)
then turn on professor oak and do like (11:45 - 11:53)
wonderful or Oh was I couldn't help but (11:48 - 11:57)
smile every single time it was just it (11:53 - 12:00)
was like the the best table location in (11:57 - 12:02)
the world to be sitting next to (12:00 - 12:05)
Professor Oak and having kids and fans (12:02 - 12:09)
come up and then him just turning on the (12:05 - 12:11)
oak voice and like seeing those people (12:09 - 12:14)
just light up it was just a really (12:11 - 12:17)
unreal experience I got some I got a (12:14 - 12:20)
little bit of dirt on on why professor (12:17 - 12:24)
oak is no longer Professor Oak uh-oh (12:20 - 12:27)
so and this is gonna spill the tea this (12:24 - 12:31)
also applies to I think Jason page but I (12:27 - 12:32)
that's that's more of a different story (12:31 - 12:36)
but for professor oak them and the (12:32 - 12:39)
original Kasich's of Veronica Taylor and (12:36 - 12:41)
the people who the guy who played Brock (12:39 - 12:43)
and the guy who played like James and (12:41 - 12:48)
stuff they were hired by 4kids media you (12:43 - 12:51)
remember for kids the logos yeah came at (12:48 - 12:53)
the end of the episodes with the number (12:51 - 12:55)
four and then the word kids after it yes (12:53 - 12:58)
four kids so they were all hired by four (12:55 - 13:01)
kids to do the Pokemon anime and (12:58 - 13:03)
obviously what ash voices yes (13:01 - 13:05)
and obviously when they started doing (13:03 - 13:06)
that they didn't realize that it was (13:05 - 13:09)
going to be so big and and whatnot they (13:06 - 13:12)
had I think originally an eight-year (13:09 - 13:15)
contract and so at the end of eight year (13:12 - 13:19)
eight years it just turned into you know (13:15 - 13:22)
contract will just keep paying for you (13:19 - 13:24)
and and whatnot (13:22 - 13:26)
well you have an eight year commitment (13:24 - 13:28)
and then option to renew year to year or (13:26 - 13:29)
something like that (13:28 - 13:32)
yes sir within that year they were (13:29 - 13:34)
working on a new contract for four kids (13:32 - 13:37)
and another company I can't remember (13:34 - 13:39)
what it was called but it was the it (13:37 - 13:43)
when they started doing the hoenn stuff (13:39 - 13:45)
because obviously that's one out and the (13:43 - 13:48)
animation quality changed and boys (13:45 - 13:51)
started changing if I'm not mistaken you (13:48 - 13:53)
know it happens to a lot of adolescents (13:51 - 13:56)
but yes so another company came in and (13:53 - 14:00)
under bidded for kids and so Nintendo (13:56 - 14:03)
and the Pokemon company decided to go (14:00 - 14:05)
with that other company because it was (14:03 - 14:10)
cheaper so because that new company (14:05 - 14:13)
wasn't for kids media and for kids media (14:10 - 14:15)
technically was in charge of these voice (14:13 - 14:19)
actors all those voice actors under the (14:15 - 14:21)
original anime were pretty much fired (14:19 - 14:24)
because the new company couldn't just (14:21 - 14:26)
hire them because they were under (14:24 - 14:28)
contract with four kids well I mean hmm (14:26 - 14:31)
you think they'd have an opportunity to (14:28 - 14:32)
get their contracts cancelled and (14:31 - 14:34)
transferred or something like that but (14:32 - 14:36)
if if that company wanted to save money (14:34 - 14:38)
then probably they felt that they'd be (14:36 - 14:39)
able to do it cheaper with new voice (14:38 - 14:41)
talent I'm sure it's something along (14:39 - 14:43)
those lines I mean they they ended up (14:41 - 14:47)
doing the show awfully yeah yeah I think (14:43 - 14:50)
I asked if if like TCP I are in attend (14:47 - 14:51)
to every reached out after that fact (14:50 - 14:54)
because like right obviously that now (14:51 - 14:56)
it's been like eleven more years and (14:54 - 14:58)
Professor Oak is an under contract with (14:56 - 14:59)
four kids anymore (14:58 - 15:03)
he said that he did one or two other (14:59 - 15:05)
things with Pokemon after the fact like (15:03 - 15:09)
they just randomly called him up uh yeah (15:05 - 15:10)
have you heard of a game called Pokemon (15:09 - 15:16)
snap was the first ten years yeah no it (15:10 - 15:19)
was yeah yeah they randomly called him (15:16 - 15:21)
up they he did a couple things and then (15:19 - 15:24)
that's that's been that so he hasn't (15:21 - 15:27)
done anything since since that I asked (15:24 - 15:29)
if there was any word if he was doing (15:27 - 15:32)
the 20th anniversary movie since that's (15:29 - 15:34)
you know based on the first couple (15:32 - 15:36)
episodes of the anime plus true a new (15:34 - 15:39)
twist and he said he didn't even know (15:36 - 15:40)
they were doing a new movie and they (15:39 - 15:42)
weren't doing a movie that was a (15:40 - 15:46)
throwback movie so he was like I'm (15:42 - 15:48)
actually going to try to call them and (15:46 - 15:50)
ask who they're voicing for Professor (15:48 - 15:50)
Oak (15:50 - 15:53)
he like he like started looking it up (15:50 - 15:53)
right away (15:53 - 15:56)
phone like he was very like I want to do (15:53 - 15:59)
this which is cut it was really cool but (15:56 - 16:01)
I don't I don't know if that sounds so (15:59 - 16:08)
weird what sounds word that he'll I mean (16:01 - 16:10)
it's it's it's if it's gonna be in (16:08 - 16:13)
theaters in November I'm great (16:10 - 16:15)
well that was one of my questions was (16:13 - 16:17)
was like how long does it take for (16:15 - 16:20)
because the movies done if it movies (16:17 - 16:23)
done English people come in do the lines (16:20 - 16:25)
make the movie in English he said he (16:23 - 16:28)
wasn't sure but they would have to start (16:25 - 16:30)
pretty soon to get done by November but (16:28 - 16:32)
he said it was doable so I don't know I (16:30 - 16:34)
mean I I mean like I hope you didn't (16:32 - 16:36)
start trouble I hope you didn't start a (16:34 - 16:39)
battle in the Pokemon world I don't know (16:36 - 16:41)
who plays Professor Oak right now (16:39 - 16:45)
well Samson oak or original oak is that (16:41 - 16:47)
I think it's the same voice actor for (16:45 - 16:51)
both and tensions the illusion a little (16:47 - 16:54)
inversion right yeah yeah I I would (16:51 - 16:56)
assume that they're probably gonna do (16:54 - 16:58)
the people that are doing the TV show (16:56 - 17:01)
right now right like who I I don't know (16:58 - 17:04)
the name of the woman who plays Ashe (17:01 - 17:07)
currently but it would be really weird (17:04 - 17:09)
to be like here's the new movie you're (17:07 - 17:11)
not gonna do it we're gonna bring back (17:09 - 17:13)
this oil old voice actor which you know (17:11 - 17:16)
some people love I think Veronica Taylor (17:13 - 17:19)
is great but I also think the new ash is (17:16 - 17:22)
great yeah I think that that's a decent (17:19 - 17:25)
voice that they have so I yeah I don't (17:22 - 17:26)
know how that works I feel like bringing (17:25 - 17:29)
back old voice actors is stepping on the (17:26 - 17:32)
toes of the current voice actors that's (17:29 - 17:35)
true and it becomes like it's like (17:32 - 17:37)
disruptive when you expect to hear one (17:35 - 17:38)
particular voice and you hear a (17:37 - 17:40)
different voice even if it was the (17:38 - 17:41)
original voice you're kind of used to (17:40 - 17:43)
hearing the new voice and you see what (17:41 - 17:46)
I'm saying totally I do have any more (17:43 - 17:49)
questions about this book again you gave (17:46 - 17:51)
a panel that way what was your panel (17:49 - 17:54)
what had that but oh wait we're gonna (17:51 - 17:57)
hear it aren't we yeah so I'm going to (17:54 - 18:01)
include the panel in in the later half (17:57 - 18:02)
of this episode it's actually only about (18:01 - 18:06)
a half hour long how many people came (18:02 - 18:07)
so each panel (18:06 - 18:10)
was a hundred seats I would want to say (18:07 - 18:14)
about 30 or 40 people came out all right (18:10 - 18:15)
because I actually when you said there (18:14 - 18:17)
are about 500 people at the con I was (18:15 - 18:21)
like at PAX East we had like 300 400 (18:17 - 18:25)
people in the room yes it's like did you (18:21 - 18:28)
just like completely draw everybody that (18:25 - 18:30)
was at the con into your panel well (18:28 - 18:33)
here's here's the problem with our panel (18:30 - 18:35)
it was at 7:00 p.m. (18:33 - 18:38)
ooh that's a deadly hour it's a very (18:35 - 18:40)
deadly hour because either people are (18:38 - 18:43)
done for the day or they're done for the (18:40 - 18:45)
day because they probably went to dinner (18:43 - 18:49)
at 5 or 6 p.m. and they probably don't (18:45 - 18:52)
want to come back to the con yeah yeah (18:49 - 18:54)
the other problem or fantastic internet (18:52 - 18:57)
personalities like yourself yeah well (18:54 - 19:01)
they're there every I'm pretty sure we (18:57 - 19:06)
had probably about 10 to 12 groups and I (19:01 - 19:08)
say groups because it was usually one or (19:06 - 19:11)
more person come up and say they listen (19:08 - 19:13)
to the show and they love it and I only (19:11 - 19:15)
say groups because I the other person is (19:13 - 19:17)
smiling and nodding their heads and one (19:15 - 19:18)
other only one person is doing all the (19:17 - 19:22)
talking so I'm not sure if the person (19:18 - 19:24)
not talking is a listener or not or just (19:22 - 19:27)
as like yeah yeah my significant other (19:24 - 19:29)
my friend can listens to you but I don't (19:27 - 19:32)
I'm just smiling and nodding my friend (19:29 - 19:35)
is one of them just like completely (19:32 - 19:40)
obsessed ISE fans you know yes correct (19:35 - 19:42)
so all the people that specifically came (19:40 - 19:44)
up to our panel or to our booth and said (19:42 - 19:46)
they listen to us they did they were all (19:44 - 19:48)
at the panel so that was that was (19:46 - 19:50)
awesome and I think there was a couple (19:48 - 19:51)
people that were like we drove two hours (19:50 - 19:55)
to get here or people made commitments (19:51 - 19:56)
to come and that's just very very (19:55 - 19:58)
flattering how many of them were (19:56 - 19:59)
disappointed that I wasn't there (19:58 - 20:02)
ah I think no one was because I think we (19:59 - 20:04)
did a good job at communicating that you (20:02 - 20:07)
weren't going to be there that's true (20:04 - 20:10)
but every one that came up was super (20:07 - 20:12)
nice I think Greg makes a good ten (20:10 - 20:16)
percent will form so yeah this is this (20:12 - 20:19)
is that specific to this is not specific (20:16 - 20:20)
to pokey can (20:19 - 20:22)
like I said I've been to a lot of (20:20 - 20:24)
conventions people will come up they (20:22 - 20:26)
will start talking there was stopped (20:24 - 20:28)
talking with me and I they'll pick up a (20:26 - 20:31)
business card and I'll usually go into (20:28 - 20:33)
my pitch of what you know why I'm there (20:31 - 20:35)
which is so we're a Pokemon podcast (20:33 - 20:37)
called it's super fective we do a weekly (20:35 - 20:39)
show every single Monday which is an (20:37 - 20:43)
iTunes Google Play SoundCloud etc and so (20:39 - 20:44)
just to let you know we talk about the (20:43 - 20:48)
TCG the anime the video game the magic (20:44 - 20:52)
harp jump Pokemon go etc and then after (20:48 - 20:54)
all of that I usually go do you listen (20:52 - 20:56)
to any podcasts and so I do this deal (20:54 - 20:59)
with pretty much anyone who you know (20:56 - 21:01)
picks up the business card every now and (20:59 - 21:03)
then after I'm done with the spiel (21:01 - 21:07)
people some people will go oh I know I (21:03 - 21:09)
already listened to you guys but they (21:07 - 21:12)
don't like start off with that which is (21:09 - 21:14)
really funny I think they're just like (21:12 - 21:17)
hesitant to say like oh my god I listen (21:14 - 21:19)
to you guys where most people that come (21:17 - 21:22)
up to the booth that's the first thing (21:19 - 21:24)
they do is they come up and they go hi (21:22 - 21:25)
I'm so-and-so I listen to you guys every (21:24 - 21:28)
week and then they usually say who their (21:25 - 21:30)
favorite is or whatnot and so there's (21:28 - 21:33)
always like those those two types of (21:30 - 21:35)
fans the fans that will like instantly (21:33 - 21:36)
tell you they listen to you and then the (21:35 - 21:37)
fans that are really hesitant and then (21:36 - 21:40)
almost every every single time when I do (21:37 - 21:42)
my spiel that's when they admit that (21:40 - 21:45)
they listen which is just I mean it's (21:42 - 21:47)
humbling they're like look Steve I have (21:45 - 21:51)
heard your stuff look I've listened I'm (21:47 - 21:54)
only here for Mike understandable (21:51 - 21:57)
yeah the 7 o'clock hour was was kind of (21:54 - 22:00)
killer overall and it didn't so the (21:57 - 22:04)
Polka con was fun I had a blast but I (22:00 - 22:07)
don't think there was a consistent six (22:04 - 22:10)
hours of things to do so from like noon (22:07 - 22:11)
to 6 p.m. (22:10 - 22:14)
unless you were consistently doing the (22:11 - 22:18)
VGC or the TCG or watching the anime (22:14 - 22:21)
movies in the theater room or I guess (22:18 - 22:23)
going to other panels a lot of people (22:21 - 22:25)
were leaving midday and then coming back (22:23 - 22:29)
later if you if you were there all day (22:25 - 22:32)
you really had to be doing every single (22:29 - 22:34)
thing the poky con offered (22:32 - 22:37)
it offered a lot but I don't know if the (22:34 - 22:39)
initial 200 people that came through the (22:37 - 22:41)
door were committed to doing everything (22:39 - 22:44)
for the con or just coming to do (22:41 - 22:46)
specific you know what I mean yeah and (22:44 - 22:49)
you don't have to do everything at a con (22:46 - 22:52)
to enjoy the con and get your value out (22:49 - 22:53)
of it so that's cool (22:52 - 22:56)
yeah yes I am what's the next cut was (22:53 - 22:58)
that we're both going to Gen Con that's (22:56 - 22:59)
true in a week and a half (22:58 - 23:02)
mm-hmm which is not which and we're (22:59 - 23:05)
while it's not a Pokemon trip it's not a (23:02 - 23:07)
it's but it's both personal trips for us (23:05 - 23:11)
we just do this 290 Pokemon but we will (23:07 - 23:13)
be doing Pokemon there there's like a a (23:11 - 23:15)
draft release that we're participating (23:13 - 23:17)
in yeah I was gonna say well it's not a (23:15 - 23:20)
Pokemon trip it's not not a Pokemon trip (23:17 - 23:22)
yeah I would actually but we're not (23:20 - 23:24)
doing a draft pay attention to what you (23:22 - 23:27)
signed up ours loser booster filled (23:24 - 23:29)
sealed booster wheels sealed sealed deck (23:27 - 23:32)
seal deck yes so do you know how that (23:29 - 23:33)
works have you been through that before (23:32 - 23:37)
I have I applied the TCG very for a long (23:33 - 23:40)
time well yeah but this is a new format (23:37 - 23:44)
is it what's do about it okay so maybe (23:40 - 23:46)
sure this is I'm pretty sure you get (23:44 - 23:49)
eight booster packs you open them up you (23:46 - 23:52)
make a deck they give you energy cards (23:49 - 23:54)
you play three rounds and then when (23:52 - 23:56)
you're done they give you two more (23:54 - 24:01)
booster packs incorrect so this is if I (23:56 - 24:03)
if I believe I'm right this is the new (24:01 - 24:07)
format that puka has come up with you (24:03 - 24:12)
get a balk this that has like most of a (24:07 - 24:14)
deck constructed already so everybody I (24:12 - 24:16)
think they either have like one or two (24:14 - 24:19)
where everybody gets the same cards (24:16 - 24:21)
there's like two variations on it but (24:19 - 24:23)
everybody gets the same cards and then (24:21 - 24:25)
you get four packs and then you can mix (24:23 - 24:27)
those packs into that standard built (24:25 - 24:30)
deck that you got to make a final deck (24:27 - 24:32)
that's yours and then at the end you get (24:30 - 24:35)
more packs but do you keep the the do (24:32 - 24:37)
you keep the fake deck they give you yes (24:35 - 24:40)
it comes in this really nice like deck (24:37 - 24:43)
box but it's all everybody way cooler (24:40 - 24:45)
cards yeah because there's just like a (24:43 - 24:47)
base where everybody's gonna have the (24:45 - 24:48)
same cards and then it's like (24:47 - 24:50)
things that you pull from the packs (24:48 - 24:52)
become texts that you can add to your (24:50 - 24:55)
deck alright I'm done with that we (24:52 - 24:56)
should we should after the show we (24:55 - 24:57)
should compare notes make sure we're (24:56 - 24:59)
some occur in the correct draft I think (24:57 - 25:02)
we are but we should double check yes (24:59 - 25:04)
show you one more thing so we're going (25:02 - 25:05)
to Gen Con so if you are going to Gen (25:04 - 25:08)
Con don't hesitate to you know reach out (25:05 - 25:11)
to Will or myself or Micah or Irene on (25:08 - 25:14)
Twitter Travis will not be there so that (25:11 - 25:16)
Greg will be there Greg will be to you (25:14 - 25:19)
so don't hesitate to reach out Jenn cons (25:16 - 25:21)
like five days long I am more than happy (25:19 - 25:24)
to make time for everyone and then after (25:21 - 25:27)
that at the end of August I actually (25:24 - 25:29)
think it starts on September 1st but I (25:27 - 25:33)
myself and Irene will be at PAX West in (25:29 - 25:36)
Seattle and we will be doing a panel (25:33 - 25:39)
there I know I'm working to get some (25:36 - 25:41)
more guests on the panel but the J wits (25:39 - 25:45)
from YouTube / twitch the J wits we've (25:41 - 25:47)
had him on he will be on the panel which (25:45 - 25:49)
is really great I know they gave us like (25:47 - 25:52)
a 400 to 500 person room this year I (25:49 - 25:54)
guess they were like hey you guys filled (25:52 - 25:56)
that room at Boston so we're gonna up (25:54 - 25:58)
your room size that's really exciting I (25:56 - 26:01)
don't I I know the panel's on Monday I (25:58 - 26:03)
believe it's at 12:30 but don't hold me (26:01 - 26:05)
to that I'm sure I tweeted at some point (26:03 - 26:07)
we'll get you more details as we closer (26:05 - 26:09)
to that event but with that being said (26:07 - 26:13)
let's do some Pokemon news now this is (26:09 - 26:15)
just we're very light on Pokemon go this (26:13 - 26:18)
week right now Moltres is still (26:15 - 26:20)
happening in the Pokemon girl world if (26:18 - 26:22)
you can try to catch them all tree-sit (26:20 - 26:23)
ends Monday night (26:22 - 26:25)
Zapdos also starts on Monday and then (26:23 - 26:27)
we're probably gonna get nothing after (26:25 - 26:29)
Zapdos I don't think I don't think (26:27 - 26:31)
they're rotating back to Articuno I (26:29 - 26:32)
think they're actually gonna give us a (26:31 - 26:34)
break so do you know what hour of the (26:32 - 26:38)
day it switched from Articuno to Moltres (26:34 - 26:41)
I don't know what it was in other time (26:38 - 26:44)
zones but for the central time zone and (26:41 - 26:47)
for me I was still seeing Articuno at 6 (26:44 - 26:51)
p.m. all right interesting ok ok and (26:47 - 26:53)
those were like fresh Articuno like two (26:51 - 26:56)
hours left at like 6 p.m. all right so (26:53 - 26:59)
that would be for Pacific so it's after (26:56 - 27:01)
that all right this is the news I want (26:59 - 27:02)
to talk about there (27:01 - 27:04)
have been reports that indicate it is (27:02 - 27:07)
impossible to catch a raid boss with the (27:04 - 27:09)
very last premier ball so what does that (27:07 - 27:12)
mean yeah what does that mean so when (27:09 - 27:15)
you complete a raid in Pokemon go you (27:12 - 27:18)
get a set amount of premier balls all a (27:15 - 27:20)
permit a premier ball has the same catch (27:18 - 27:22)
rate in Pokemon go as a regular pokeball (27:20 - 27:26)
so if you're catching like a wild hare (27:22 - 27:28)
cross for example in Pokemon go you (27:26 - 27:30)
might want to use a great ball or an (27:28 - 27:32)
ultra ball because it increases the (27:30 - 27:36)
catch rate of course and heracross might (27:32 - 27:38)
be a harder Pokemon - catch and or a (27:36 - 27:41)
rare enough to the point where you go I (27:38 - 27:43)
don't see heracross often so I want to (27:41 - 27:45)
make sure I get it and it doesn't run (27:43 - 27:47)
away in a raid battle you don't have (27:45 - 27:49)
that option you only get premier balls (27:47 - 27:51)
and you are awarded those premier balls (27:49 - 27:54)
based on how did how well you did in the (27:51 - 27:59)
raid and what gym the raid was at so for (27:54 - 28:01)
example if you are fighting a Moltres at (27:59 - 28:05)
a Valor gym and most of the people (28:01 - 28:08)
participating in the raid are valor and (28:05 - 28:12)
valor did the most damage to Moltres you (28:08 - 28:14)
will probably get about 11 to 12 balls (28:12 - 28:18)
to use to catch mole trees now if you (28:14 - 28:21)
were mystic in that raid and it was a (28:18 - 28:23)
Valor gym with valor doing the most (28:21 - 28:27)
damage you as a mystic player might only (28:23 - 28:30)
get 5 or 6 balls to catch small treason (28:27 - 28:33)
so it is very dependent on your team and (28:30 - 28:36)
your team's contribution now what this (28:33 - 28:39)
last ball means is there have been tons (28:36 - 28:42)
of videos of people attempting to catch (28:39 - 28:44)
raid bosses with the very last pokeball (28:42 - 28:47)
and no one's been able to do it so a (28:44 - 28:50)
really good example of this is Magikarp (28:47 - 28:53)
Magikarp is the easiest raid boss to (28:50 - 28:55)
catch out of all the raid bosses that (28:53 - 28:57)
are available when you attempt to catch (28:55 - 29:01)
a Pokemon in Pokemon go there's our (28:57 - 29:03)
there's a couple factors that matter the (29:01 - 29:05)
ball choice which in a raid you don't (29:03 - 29:06)
have a choice (29:05 - 29:07)
you have to use the premier balls that (29:06 - 29:10)
give you the berries so you can give a (29:07 - 29:14)
raspberry to increase the percentage of (29:10 - 29:16)
catch or you can get (29:14 - 29:18)
I think I I want to say it's like I (29:16 - 29:19)
don't have the numbers in front of me (29:18 - 29:21)
but I want to say it increases it like (29:19 - 29:24)
like 10% or something like that III know (29:21 - 29:26)
I'm wrong but let's just for this (29:24 - 29:29)
example let's just say 10% or you could (29:26 - 29:31)
use a golden raspberry which again not (29:29 - 29:33)
exact numbers but let's say that (29:31 - 29:36)
increases the catch rate by 25% which I (29:33 - 29:38)
know is way too high but just an example (29:36 - 29:40)
so the other things that matter is if (29:38 - 29:42)
you throw a curve ball or not so if you (29:40 - 29:44)
throw a curve ball that also increases (29:42 - 29:46)
the catch rate and then the final thing (29:44 - 29:50)
that matters is the nice great or (29:46 - 29:53)
excellent if it says nice that's good (29:50 - 29:55)
but if it says great that's even better (29:53 - 29:57)
and if it says excellent that's even (29:55 - 29:59)
better so each one of those words (29:57 - 30:01)
slightly increases the chance of (29:59 - 30:04)
catching now if you take all that math (30:01 - 30:06)
together I'm going to simplify it here (30:04 - 30:09)
for Magikarp if you are fighting a rade (30:06 - 30:12)
Magikarp and you throw a curve ball with (30:09 - 30:16)
a golden raspberry and you get great or (30:12 - 30:21)
excellent you have a 99% chance to catch (30:16 - 30:24)
Magikarp following me well yes I got (30:21 - 30:27)
that science down there are tons of (30:24 - 30:30)
videos of people throwing the very last (30:27 - 30:33)
rate rate of the very last premier ball (30:30 - 30:37)
they have on to Magikarp hitting curve (30:33 - 30:40)
hitting great using the golden raspberry (30:37 - 30:43)
99% chance will and none of them can (30:40 - 30:46)
catch it it's impossible the Magikarp (30:43 - 30:48)
always gets out of the ball and then (30:46 - 30:50)
runs away because the trainer no longer (30:48 - 30:52)
has any premier balls left you think it (30:50 - 30:54)
might be because the Magikarp is tired (30:52 - 30:55)
of getting hit in the head with balls (30:54 - 30:59)
maybe okay so now keep us in my trainers (30:55 - 31:02)
when you're doing a raid and you get to (30:59 - 31:04)
the very last premier ball at that point (31:02 - 31:06)
it's impossible you cannot catch the (31:04 - 31:08)
Pokemon that last ball will never catch (31:06 - 31:11)
you a Pokemon no matter what is what you (31:08 - 31:13)
use to attempt to catch it there is not (31:11 - 31:15)
a single video that can be found of (31:13 - 31:18)
somebody catching a pokemon with their (31:15 - 31:21)
very last pokeball premiere ball sorry (31:18 - 31:23)
so what should I do just not toss it I (31:21 - 31:26)
would one not waste a Golden Raspberry (31:23 - 31:28)
because you're not gonna catch it well (31:26 - 31:29)
so have you heard that (31:28 - 31:32)
strategy where you do a Nana B at the (31:29 - 31:35)
beginning yeah and that kind of it stays (31:32 - 31:37)
with like it fills them up so (31:35 - 31:38)
deliciously that they don't move around (31:37 - 31:42)
as much yourself I have I've only done (31:38 - 31:45)
two mulches reads the I did the Nana bit (31:42 - 31:48)
the Nana berry trick on both of them (31:45 - 31:51)
the first Moltres I didn't catch but it (31:48 - 31:54)
was it was my fault like my screen was (31:51 - 31:56)
freaking out and my finger was like (31:54 - 31:57)
slipping which my balls were just like (31:56 - 31:59)
dropping to the ground right away it was (31:57 - 32:00)
very frustrating but I got the issue (31:59 - 32:02)
what's this in the rain is that is that (32:00 - 32:04)
strike in the rain in the rain (32:02 - 32:07)
I caught the mall trees I'm like why (32:04 - 32:09)
because it was raining out and fire type (32:07 - 32:11)
moves or repost very weak that dude was (32:09 - 32:14)
at a disadvantage the trick there is (32:11 - 32:17)
what you're what people think and this (32:14 - 32:20)
is not confirmed but what people think (32:17 - 32:23)
is if you throw a than the naba bury the (32:20 - 32:26)
bananas what that berry does is it (32:23 - 32:28)
doesn't increase the catch rate but it (32:26 - 32:31)
calms the pokemon down so they they (32:28 - 32:33)
attack less often and they don't move (32:31 - 32:36)
around so it makes it very easy to at (32:33 - 32:38)
least hit them with your pokeball if if (32:36 - 32:41)
you're bad at throwing pokeballs now (32:38 - 32:43)
that is supposed to only last one turn (32:41 - 32:45)
but what people are reporting is when (32:43 - 32:48)
you use it right away it seems to last (32:45 - 32:52)
into multiple turns like multiple throws (32:48 - 32:54)
it's not as effective as the very first (32:52 - 32:56)
time you use it but it seems to have (32:54 - 32:59)
this like lasting impression but again (32:56 - 33:02)
that's not confirmed but I don't know it (32:59 - 33:03)
might be worth trying (33:02 - 33:04)
I think people in slack also said they (33:03 - 33:07)
tried it and it seems to have worked but (33:04 - 33:09)
there's no hard data on that there's no (33:07 - 33:11)
like numbers I can give you to verify (33:09 - 33:14)
but going back to one the very last (33:11 - 33:17)
premier ball doesn't catch people are (33:14 - 33:20)
chalking that up to it's saying a bug I (33:17 - 33:23)
mean if you look at the math and it's (33:20 - 33:25)
telling you that it's a 99 percent catch (33:23 - 33:28)
rate for magic carp and you see 10 (33:25 - 33:30)
different people all fail that that (33:28 - 33:32)
there's something wrong with the game oh (33:30 - 33:36)
now I agree that's that yes unless it's (33:32 - 33:39)
like only that people who exist in that (33:36 - 33:43)
1% are the ones that are taking video (33:39 - 33:47)
their Falls failing yes which would be (33:43 - 33:51)
somewhat of an anomaly on its own so but (33:47 - 33:53)
until that's resolved I just want to let (33:51 - 33:54)
people know that if you have one ball (33:53 - 33:56)
left you're not going to catch the (33:54 - 33:58)
Pokemon so don't waste a golden (33:56 - 34:01)
raspberry or anything else just accept (33:58 - 34:03)
the fact that ball number two is (34:01 - 34:07)
technically your last ball wait now you (34:03 - 34:09)
don't get to are there people who only (34:07 - 34:11)
get three balls no I think the lowest (34:09 - 34:13)
you can get is five so that your (34:11 - 34:15)
second-to-last ball yes is your last (34:13 - 34:21)
ball all right there is a dazzling (34:15 - 34:26)
sazzle so Azal at Ginga yeah good nice (34:21 - 34:29)
level fifty with the ability corrosion (34:26 - 34:32)
held item focus sash moves fake out (34:29 - 34:35)
toxic sludge bomb and flame thrower heat (34:32 - 34:39)
up your battles with Sol Azal in Pokemon (34:35 - 34:41)
Sun or Pokemon moon video game with a (34:39 - 34:44)
code from participating GameStop stores (34:42 - 34:47)
the venomous poison and fire type (34:44 - 34:50)
Pokemon Sol Azal has its signature (34:47 - 34:52)
corrosion ability which enables it to (34:50 - 34:55)
make even usual resistance steel and (34:52 - 34:58)
poison-type pokémon badly poisoned by (34:55 - 35:00)
its potent toxic move stop by your local (34:58 - 35:02)
game shop and pick up a code to receive (35:00 - 35:05)
this Pokemon in your game with just the (35:02 - 35:07)
basic instructions so this is the same (35:05 - 35:10)
thing they did for like in Rock a couple (35:07 - 35:13)
a couple months ago nice and so what (35:10 - 35:16)
corrosion does you kind of said it but (35:13 - 35:17)
just to make it clear typically steel (35:16 - 35:19)
types and poison types can't be poisoned (35:17 - 35:23)
but if you have corrosion you can poison (35:19 - 35:23)
those types (35:23 - 35:27)
speaking of like in Rock a huge (35:23 - 35:29)
discovery of a new like in rock form (35:27 - 35:34)
breaking news well Wow dusk form like in (35:29 - 35:36)
rock will bare fangs in Pokemon ultra (35:34 - 35:39)
Sun and Pokemon ultra moon it has been (35:36 - 35:41)
confirmed that a new form of liken rock (35:39 - 35:43)
will appear in the Pokemon world called (35:41 - 35:47)
dusk form the colors of dusk form like (35:43 - 35:50)
in rock has a slightly different body (35:47 - 35:54)
eyes also differ from midday forum and (35:50 - 35:57)
midnight form you can you can't get (35:54 - 35:59)
desk form like and rock on your team by (35:57 - 36:01)
ordinary methods such as discovering a (35:59 - 36:03)
mysterious Pokemon in the wild so check (36:01 - 36:06)
back soon for news on how to get dusk (36:03 - 36:07)
form like and rock along with more (36:06 - 36:10)
details about Pokemon ultra Sun and (36:07 - 36:12)
Pokemon ultra moon and that was right (36:10 - 36:16)
off Pokemon calm there you go so I (36:12 - 36:18)
believe if some one of our intrepid (36:16 - 36:21)
listeners wants to make the effort one (36:18 - 36:23)
of us did predict that potentially in (36:21 - 36:26)
the ultras that they would be doing new (36:23 - 36:29)
like rocks for like yeah sunrise and (36:26 - 36:33)
dusk spoiler for the anime oh no ash (36:29 - 36:36)
gets a rock rough ah now I'm spoiled (36:33 - 36:40)
Ash's rock rough evolves into this new (36:36 - 36:45)
lichen rock what it was known in the (36:40 - 36:48)
Japanese variety show meet up at Pokemon (36:45 - 36:50)
house that's like a spoiler for a (36:48 - 36:53)
spoiler I know I said spoiler no that's (36:50 - 36:55)
like a triple-decker spoiler cuz it's (36:53 - 36:58)
like the anime is spoiling something in (36:55 - 37:00)
a video game that hasn't come out yet (36:58 - 37:04)
and then you spoiled it I did but uh if (37:00 - 37:07)
you want I don't think the in-game (37:04 - 37:09)
sprite for like and rot it's not a (37:07 - 37:12)
sprites to the reading model of like and (37:09 - 37:14)
rock it's hard to tell like the (37:12 - 37:15)
differences because it kind of does look (37:14 - 37:18)
like midday form a bit but that does the (37:15 - 37:20)
colors but if you look at the anime (37:18 - 37:26)
version of dusk form aka ashes like in (37:20 - 37:29)
rock you can actually like very clearly (37:26 - 37:32)
see the differences because it's an HD (37:29 - 37:35)
drawing yes I would say the biggest (37:32 - 37:40)
difference for dusk form from midday (37:35 - 37:47)
form is dusk form has a larger main so (37:40 - 37:49)
similar to the fact we're midnight forms (37:47 - 37:52)
main kind of comes out and becomes a (37:49 - 37:52)
pompadour (37:52 - 37:54)
so dusk form just the main gets bigger (37:52 - 37:57)
than midday form and it looks like the (37:54 - 38:01)
tail is of like shrinking so it's it (37:57 - 38:02)
really looks like halfway between the (38:01 - 38:04)
two of them form is from what I can see (38:02 - 38:09)
going back to the soul Azal news (38:04 - 38:12)
do you think those are related and what (38:09 - 38:15)
I mean by that is game study this is (38:12 - 38:18)
game stops second Pokemon on a card or (38:15 - 38:21)
Sun and Moon so if they did that for (38:18 - 38:24)
like in rock and now they're doing it (38:21 - 38:27)
for salah soul is salah so going to get (38:24 - 38:28)
a different form (38:27 - 38:30)
are they hinting at we're going to get (38:28 - 38:34)
salah sold gangster form i could see (38:30 - 38:39)
like that leak I could see them doing a (38:34 - 38:42)
male Salah so I feel like that is (38:39 - 38:45)
plausible yeah you know what actually a (38:42 - 38:47)
male's a male Salah soul evolution that (38:45 - 38:50)
is only a distribution so that it (38:47 - 38:52)
doesn't have to be reprogrammed into the (38:50 - 38:55)
game or something like that it also so (38:52 - 38:57)
the the cool thing about Salah soul and (38:55 - 38:59)
like the gimmick there the the (38:57 - 39:02)
quote-unquote gimmick is that only the (38:59 - 39:05)
females can evolve and it's very hard to (39:02 - 39:09)
find a female Sandlot soul and it yeah (39:05 - 39:11)
they're about what is about twelve point (39:09 - 39:12)
five thirteen percent (39:11 - 39:14)
right like that so have you introduced a (39:12 - 39:17)
male version of the Pokemon you're still (39:14 - 39:19)
the female is still just as rare the (39:17 - 39:22)
question is is the female still going to (39:19 - 39:24)
be the better choice in like competitive (39:22 - 39:29)
like does the does the gender and the (39:24 - 39:32)
ability make it better than its male (39:29 - 39:35)
counterpart because if they make a male (39:32 - 39:40)
Salah soul similar with the ability what (39:35 - 39:43)
with at least just the ability then (39:40 - 39:46)
you're you're not giving people an (39:43 - 39:49)
incentive to get the female one if it (39:46 - 39:53)
wasn't different enough in move sets or (39:49 - 39:55)
IVs or they could adjust the stats too (39:53 - 39:57)
right like the female could be faster (39:55 - 40:00)
the male could be more defensive they (39:57 - 40:03)
they they would still have to make them (40:00 - 40:06)
different enough yeah I don't think so (40:03 - 40:10)
la soul's seeing that much a competitive (40:06 - 40:12)
play it's it's got a good good set of (40:10 - 40:16)
weaknesses there and its strongest so (40:12 - 40:18)
yeah its strongest is speed and special (40:16 - 40:22)
attack so possibly they might make it (40:18 - 40:23)
where (40:22 - 40:25)
a male Suazo is speed and physical (40:23 - 40:30)
attack right that potentially something (40:25 - 40:32)
like that final bit of news I have and (40:30 - 40:34)
this is just kind of a shorter episode (40:32 - 40:36)
of so if we miss some news or anything (40:34 - 40:38)
you know let us know but final bit of (40:36 - 40:39)
news here is that if you are (40:38 - 40:42)
participating in the Europe Safari Zone (40:39 - 40:44)
stuff for Pokemon go kangaskhan has (40:42 - 40:47)
migrated over to Europe that Pokemon was (40:44 - 40:50)
previously only Australia bound but it (40:47 - 40:53)
is appearing at locations in Europe so (40:50 - 40:56)
if you're in that region make sure you (40:53 - 40:58)
use that opportunity to get Kangaskhan (40:56 - 41:00)
if you have no plans on going to (40:58 - 41:02)
Australia the other thing is unknowns (41:00 - 41:05)
are appearing more frequently in Europe (41:02 - 41:08)
unknown being the rarest Pokemon in (41:05 - 41:10)
Pokemon go it is available everywhere (41:08 - 41:12)
but it is the rarest Pokemon it is (41:10 - 41:14)
appearing in Europe as well just like it (41:12 - 41:17)
did in Chicago in Chicago the unknowns (41:14 - 41:21)
spelled Chicago in Europe the unknowns (41:17 - 41:24)
are spelling Europe so it is possible to (41:21 - 41:28)
get any e you an are an O and the P (41:24 - 41:32)
unknown in Europe reversal from YouTube (41:28 - 41:34)
as stated that it looks like other (41:32 - 41:37)
letters are also appearing they're rarer (41:34 - 41:41)
but it seems it seems that he at least (41:37 - 41:43)
has found other letters but I'm not (41:41 - 41:45)
hundred percent sure on that part I just (41:43 - 41:47)
know that you can get unknown and it (41:45 - 41:49)
happens to spell Europe so what words (41:47 - 41:51)
can you spell with the combined letters (41:49 - 41:53)
of Chicago and Europe (41:51 - 41:56)
Wow dangerous territory the O is (41:53 - 41:58)
overlapping but otherwise all those (41:56 - 42:02)
other letters are new I know yeah you (41:58 - 42:05)
could spell hope and last bit of news (42:02 - 42:09)
here is for the Yokohama event in Japan (42:05 - 42:12)
which is Pikachu outbreak Phu outbreak (42:09 - 42:15)
it seems that mr. mime will be migrating (42:12 - 42:19)
over there mr. mime is a European only (42:15 - 42:21)
Pokemon in Pokemon go to meet the the (42:19 - 42:25)
Americas exclusive is tauros yes and (42:21 - 42:28)
nobody wanted tauros yeah yes I guess (42:25 - 42:30)
not no one wants Toros yet (42:28 - 42:32)
maybe when Australia has it the (42:30 - 42:35)
Australia will get tauros alright (42:32 - 42:36)
alright and (42:35 - 42:38)
that's that's it for news we're probably (42:36 - 42:40)
missing some stuff but I know I really (42:38 - 42:41)
wanted to make sure I talked about the (42:40 - 42:43)
premiere ball stuff for Pokemon go and I (42:41 - 42:44)
really wanted to talk about that new (42:43 - 42:46)
like and rock that like and rock came (42:44 - 42:49)
out like mid panel last night so I was (42:46 - 42:51)
like I everyone else's tweeted that (42:49 - 42:53)
everyone knows I'll just talk about it (42:51 - 42:56)
at the show yeah may as well I think it (42:53 - 43:01)
was also in korokoro so yes yes yeah (42:56 - 43:02)
we're gonna skip emails this week just (43:01 - 43:04)
because after we're done with Pokemon of (43:02 - 43:06)
the week I'm going to play the back end (43:04 - 43:08)
the back end of this show will just be (43:06 - 43:10)
from the panel which by the way I am (43:08 - 43:13)
gonna cut and edit that I know that some (43:10 - 43:14)
people don't like listening to live (43:13 - 43:18)
shows I did bring I would love to hear (43:14 - 43:19)
your feedback of how this live show (43:18 - 43:22)
sounds because I did bring I did bring (43:19 - 43:24)
my mics that I used daily for those (43:22 - 43:28)
shows and I brought a room mic or the (43:24 - 43:30)
show and so it should actually sound (43:28 - 43:32)
really good compared to the past live (43:30 - 43:33)
shows on top of the fact that I am (43:32 - 43:36)
editing it so it does it does sound more (43:33 - 43:38)
I don't know professional sound more (43:36 - 43:42)
edited it sounds edited well if it's you (43:38 - 43:45)
wanted to not sound edited I'm doing a (43:42 - 43:47)
poor job at selling this you just want (43:45 - 43:51)
nice clean quality audio where the (43:47 - 43:54)
editing is appreciated if not noticeable (43:51 - 43:56)
so we're gonna do our program out of the (43:54 - 44:02)
week which is Mawile which I believe oh (43:56 - 44:05)
I'm sure I'm sure at some point in the (44:02 - 44:08)
history of this program we're good to (44:05 - 44:11)
the point where we're at minimum 25 (44:08 - 44:13)
percent of the way through having (44:11 - 44:16)
potentially hit every Pokemon and we're (44:13 - 44:19)
not doing the Bulbasaur is out there so (44:16 - 44:23)
yeah right that's really limiting us (44:19 - 44:25)

while it is her birthday this week so I (44:29 - 44:34)

listening to the show for a while we'll (44:37 - 44:42)
take it away here all right (44:39 - 44:45)
Mawile is a short by petal Pokemon with (44:42 - 44:47)
a pale yellow body and black arms and (44:45 - 44:50)
feet its legs have a thick four (44:47 - 44:52)
like covering resembling hakama or a (44:50 - 44:54)
skirt it's most notable feature is a (44:52 - 44:56)
pair of large black jaws emerging from (44:54 - 44:58)
the back of its head these jaws have an (44:56 - 45:00)
oval yellow spot on their top surface (44:58 - 45:04)
and contain ten pointed teeth six on the (45:00 - 45:06)
top row and four on the bottom while the (45:04 - 45:08)
jaws are said to actually be transformed (45:06 - 45:11)
steel horns more while can articulate (45:08 - 45:14)
them at will using them to bite enemies (45:11 - 45:17)
and chew through iron beams it has red (45:14 - 45:19)
eyes and two black ear like extensions (45:17 - 45:21)
on either side of its head mega Mawile (45:19 - 45:23)
has a second set of Jaws protruding from (45:21 - 45:26)
the back of its head and both sets now (45:23 - 45:29)
have a spiky tuft of hair it also seems (45:26 - 45:30)
to be able to control each jaw (45:29 - 45:33)
independently of each other the ear Lake (45:30 - 45:35)
extensions on its head are longer and (45:33 - 45:37)
have tips with two points the fur on its (45:35 - 45:40)
legs is now magenta and it now has (45:37 - 45:42)
longer fur on its arms with magenta (45:40 - 45:45)
markings around its wrists ma while is (45:42 - 45:48)
typically found in caves it uses its (45:45 - 45:50)
non-threatening appearance to make foes (45:48 - 45:52)
underestimate it then attacks with giant (45:50 - 45:55)
jaws when engaged in battle Mawile (45:52 - 45:57)
usually has its back turned on the enemy (45:55 - 46:00)
to better use its jaws no Travis's week (45:57 - 46:03)
to do your move set so I will go ahead (46:00 - 46:07)
and do that and there's no Pokemon go (46:03 - 46:10)
move set from all while unfortunately it (46:07 - 46:12)
doesn't exist in the game this is from (46:10 - 46:16)
slack adamant nature 252 attack 252 (46:12 - 46:21)
speed or an HP life orb with the ability (46:16 - 46:23)
intimidate you're gonna want to use the (46:21 - 46:26)
moves play rough iron head Sucker Punch (46:23 - 46:30)
and Swords Dance not recommended to use (46:26 - 46:33)
this for competitive EDC unless you are (46:30 - 46:35)
throwing a mega stone on that Pokemon (46:33 - 46:38)
but your main strategy is a pretty (46:35 - 46:40)
straightforward one you're going to want (46:38 - 46:41)
to use Swords Dance to get that powered (46:40 - 46:44)
up and then go to town on your opponent (46:41 - 46:47)
after you have a couple sword stances in (46:44 - 46:49)
yeah yeah so the mega Mawile cuz I (46:47 - 46:51)
actually used to use one competitively (46:49 - 46:54)
it gets an ability called huge power (46:51 - 46:57)
which doubles the physical attack so (46:54 - 47:02)
moves like play rough and iron head just (46:57 - 47:03)
because (47:02 - 47:07)
completely abusive so I think that will (47:03 - 47:12)
be a wrap for this episode next week we (47:07 - 47:14)
are doing our live show to celebrate (47:12 - 47:17)

you make it look easy with that being (49:43 - 49:49)
said this has been another episode of (49:48 - 49:53)
the Pokemon podcast and we are super (49:49 - 49:54)
effective (49:53 - 50:04)
[Music] (49:54 - 50:04)
[Music] (50:07 - 50:13)
the vapor man (50:10 - 50:13)
[Music] (50:15 - 50:18)
[Music] (50:25 - 50:43)
the vapor man man hi everyone i s PJ of (50:31 - 50:47)
course my voice in here again podcast (50:43 - 50:51)
recorded here at the Minnesota polka con (50:47 - 50:54)
minor technical issue there was a (50:51 - 50:57)
specific microphone we used to pick up (50:54 - 51:00)
audience noise like audience applause or (50:57 - 51:02)
claps or booze no and booed us (51:00 - 51:04)
unfortunately now and I'm just kidding (51:02 - 51:09)
that mic didn't work and so there's a (51:04 - 51:12)
Q&A segment that we did well it was it (51:09 - 51:14)
was what we've done before like Pokemon (51:12 - 51:16)
questions and answers and we give away (51:14 - 51:21)
prizes and the mic I used at c2e2 wasn't (51:16 - 51:22)
good enough for that so I got a new mic (51:21 - 51:25)
and I set that up but apparently I (51:22 - 51:27)
didn't capture any audio so I don't know (51:25 - 51:28)
if something came unplugged or what (51:27 - 51:31)
actually happened in that case I don't (51:28 - 51:32)
actually know what happened in that case (51:31 - 51:35)
and there was a whole like segment that (51:32 - 51:38)
relied on the mic picking up the (51:35 - 51:40)
audience and it didn't do that so I just (51:38 - 51:42)
ended up cutting all that out so there's (51:40 - 51:45)
like 20 minutes of QA that I cut out (51:42 - 51:48)
that didn't really get that doesn't take (51:45 - 51:51)
away from the the main topic so we do (51:48 - 51:52)
have like 20 minutes of audio of us (51:51 - 51:54)
explaining how to eat Pokemon and (51:52 - 51:56)
whatnot I don't know if that really (51:54 - 51:58)
works without the keynote presentation (51:56 - 52:00)
that we did with it but it should sound (51:58 - 52:03)
decent everyone should sound okay (52:00 - 52:05)
hopefully you guys enjoy that if not you (52:03 - 52:08)
know you got 50 minutes prior to that (52:05 - 52:12)
and before we before I let you listen to (52:08 - 52:14)
that again just letting you know that (52:12 - 52:17)
next week is our seventh anniversary (52:14 - 52:21)
show that is on August 13th at 12 p.m. (52:17 - 52:26)
Central Time that will be live if you (52:21 - 52:29)
cannot make it that is totally ok we (52:26 - 52:30)
will still record it for Monday's (52:29 - 52:34)
episode that will be myself will and (52:30 - 52:36)
Travis and then after we're done with (52:34 - 52:41)
the show at noon I would expect that we (52:36 - 52:43)
have scheduled out an hour to two hours (52:41 - 52:44)
for that show (52:43 - 52:47)
I will take about an hour break and then (52:44 - 52:50)
Myka and I and Irene will be streaming (52:47 - 52:54)
that night Pokemon games and whatnot (52:50 - 52:56)
pretty much all night to celebrate the (52:54 - 52:58)
seventh anniversary so that stuff will (52:56 - 53:00)
be on Twitch I think we're gonna try (52:58 - 53:02)
doing the live show on YouTube of course (53:00 - 53:05)
follow the podcast at Pokemon podcast to (53:02 - 53:08)

date with that and yeah so that's that's (53:11 - 53:16)
that again apologize for the technical (53:13 - 53:19)
issue but we still got twenty minutes of (53:16 - 53:20)
audio and it sounds pretty good I think (53:19 - 53:28)
and enjoy all right hi everyone hello (53:20 - 53:30)
okay so this will be recorded just so (53:28 - 53:31)
you guys know that's why there's mics (53:30 - 53:33)
everywhere and where we start I (53:31 - 53:39)
apologize for the 1982 projector we have (53:33 - 53:42)
displaying what we we Greg Greg warned (53:39 - 53:45)
you Greg got us a projector when we (53:42 - 53:46)
found out last night that these rooms (53:45 - 53:48)
wouldn't be equipped and that's totally (53:46 - 53:51)
cool we improvised you did your best I (53:48 - 53:54)
did my best I adjusted the the following (53:51 - 53:56)
PowerPoint to make it look decent this (53:54 - 53:58)
panel will be probably as long or as (53:56 - 53:59)
short as you guys want if you guys are (53:58 - 54:01)
laughing having a good time will draw it (53:59 - 54:02)
out if no one's saying anything and (54:01 - 54:05)
walking out we'll cut it short so I'm (54:02 - 54:07)
totally up to you know business let's (54:05 - 54:09)

is our D&D Pokemon inspired podcast and (54:44 - 54:48)
he's on normal episodes of its super (54:46 - 54:51)
effective correct and down at the end is (54:48 - 54:53)
Greg who is just on mythical but he is (54:51 - 54:56)
the DM and creator of that so he writes (54:53 - 54:57)

it's set up I am for this there we go (55:18 - 55:25)
you the lean every time we wait we're (55:21 - 55:27)
not talking about that yet oh so before (55:25 - 55:29)
we begin on our topic I do have a (55:27 - 55:32)
question so if you answer the question (55:29 - 55:33)
right don't shut it out yet if you (55:32 - 55:34)
answer the question right you'll get a (55:33 - 55:37)
sticker there one question here and then (55:34 - 55:38)
five questions at the end so it kind of (55:37 - 55:40)
forces you to say if hopefully you're (55:38 - 55:42)
having a good time so raise your hand I (55:40 - 55:44)
will usually call what your shirt color (55:42 - 55:46)
is but does anyone know in the Pokemon (55:44 - 55:51)
national dex what the 303rd 300 300 (55:46 - 55:57)
pokémon is oh yeah no no I actually (55:51 - 55:59)
don't know the sealy it's kind of hard I (55:57 - 56:02)
will say it's a cat Pokemon how does (55:59 - 56:06)
that narrow down no yes skitty is it you (56:02 - 56:09)

that's the the Pokemon in the deck so (56:09 - 56:12)
you can come up and get your free (56:10 - 56:14)
sticker so we all five more of those not (56:12 - 56:16)
as hard questions later on the lean okay (56:14 - 56:19)
so now we're here is because we're gonna (56:16 - 56:21)
be talking about how to eat Pokemon or (56:19 - 56:24)
how Pokemon eat each other I guess and (56:21 - 56:26)
we'll go we'll go from there you guys (56:24 - 56:28)
ready oh yeah we're gonna start with (56:26 - 56:31)
desert Pokemon as there are a couple so (56:28 - 56:33)
Oliver I'll read the bullet points we'll (56:31 - 56:34)
discuss and then we'll move on some (56:33 - 56:36)
topics might be a little more in-depth (56:34 - 56:38)
some might not be but (56:36 - 56:40)
we all know vanilluxe vanillish (56:38 - 56:43)
vanillish they are the ice-cream Pokemon (56:40 - 56:45)
and believe it or not they are not eaten (56:43 - 56:47)
in the Pokemon world but they are there (56:45 - 56:49)
are Castelli astone am I saying that (56:47 - 56:51)
right Greg still your combs still eat (56:49 - 56:54)
cones yeah that do mimic and exist and (56:51 - 56:55)
there that's what they're based off of (56:54 - 56:57)
so people those all the time like I (56:55 - 56:59)
guess Lucario loves ice cream now let me (56:57 - 57:01)
ask you is that did the Pokemon like (56:59 - 57:06)
form from seeing a castelia cone or did (57:01 - 57:08)
it did the Casilla get on shaking (57:06 - 57:13)
because of Iowa I would assume that the (57:08 - 57:17)
Pokemon came first I would hope so that (57:13 - 57:20)
was the basis of ice cream sure that was (57:17 - 57:22)
the inspiration was inspiration it was (57:20 - 57:24)
the ice cream swirlix on the other hand (57:22 - 57:25)
also introduced the same generation (57:24 - 57:28)
which is the cotton candy pokemon no one (57:25 - 57:29)
eats that pokemon either surprisingly (57:28 - 57:32)
okay but would you I mean if you saw (57:29 - 57:34)
cotton candy just lying in a field would (57:32 - 57:37)
you think I'm gonna eat that no with a (57:34 - 57:38)
face and a face (57:37 - 57:42)
I see a cow I go oh I'm gonna eat that (57:38 - 57:50)
yeah but swirlix and the and it's (57:42 - 57:53)
evolutionary line they they eat candy (57:50 - 57:54)
they eat candy and sweets and everything (57:53 - 57:57)
so in reality you could baby consume (57:54 - 58:01)
them but no but well the candy that they (57:57 - 58:03)
consume is not living correct (58:01 - 58:06)
they're not eating each other (58:03 - 58:08)
savage over that would be real weird (58:06 - 58:11)
your question oh yeah sorry yeah you're (58:08 - 58:13)
right actually (58:11 - 58:17)
you yes Jen Jen six it is Steve so I (58:13 - 58:19)
just I like to keep all my cotton candy (58:17 - 58:22)
and ice cream pokemon together we have a (58:19 - 58:25)
list of dairy Pokemon here miltank ins (58:22 - 58:27)
could do this could use that grass (58:25 - 58:30)
little goat they both produce milk which (58:27 - 58:32)
is consumed by both humans and pokémon (58:30 - 58:34)
as you can see Professor Oak (58:32 - 58:38)
rather a great time with your eyes this (58:34 - 58:45)
is that another thing the animes gets (58:38 - 58:46)
real wild (58:45 - 58:48)
Chansey and bliss II can lay eggs which (58:46 - 58:50)
again are both consumed by humans and (58:48 - 58:53)
pokémon and Ekans favorite food is the (58:50 - 58:56)
eggs of sparrows and piggies as so (58:53 - 59:00)
confirmed at least via the Pokedex ekans (58:56 - 59:02)
eating some bird eggs here that makes (59:00 - 59:05)
kind of sense I guess based on like real (59:02 - 59:07)
world animals mm-hmm (59:05 - 59:13)
well get to the bug stuff but I'll get (59:07 - 59:15)
to the bug stuff but there are certain (59:13 - 59:16)
bug and plant pokemon that eat insects (59:15 - 59:20)
which then implies that there are (59:16 - 59:23)
animals that are not Pokemon right yeah (59:20 - 59:26)
eat yeah this is all way more believable (59:23 - 59:31)
than a an ice cream cone Pokemon I think (59:26 - 59:33)
so oh yeah well if you look at miltank (59:31 - 59:36)
and its moo moo milk that it produces (59:33 - 59:38)
yeah that is that does restore pokemons (59:36 - 59:42)
HP correct it I think milk and most (59:38 - 59:45)
videogames restores a to be as it should (59:42 - 59:48)
improving those bones that's right get (59:45 - 59:54)
those those yep we have some bird (59:48 - 59:57)
Pokemon here Pidgeotto is known to eat (59:54 - 59:59)
execute Magikarp and Caterpie I think (59:57 - 60:02)
this is made famously in Magikarp jump (59:59 - 60:06)
where Pidgeotto swoops down and the (60:02 - 60:08)
heart break the first time happened to (60:06 - 60:11)
be big it you I was like oh yeah I'll (60:08 - 60:14)
jump jump for the berries right but see (60:11 - 60:15)
you later (60:14 - 60:18)
learn over again I didn't know that (60:15 - 60:21)
could happen tallow is they claim to (60:18 - 60:23)
feed on Wurmple which makes sense (60:21 - 60:25)
because they're in the same generation I (60:23 - 60:28)
think I got that right and [ __ ] what was (60:25 - 60:31)
it cherry be terribly chair be chair B (60:28 - 60:35)
to Ruby Ruby is it is it this a (60:31 - 60:38)
renunciation - Ruby - really it's (60:35 - 60:40)
whatever you want it to be yes I like (60:38 - 60:41)
that but it's like Burger King up here (60:40 - 60:43)
whatever you want (60:41 - 60:45)
yeah Burger King you know have it your (60:43 - 60:48)
way yeah yeah eggs milk crazy (60:45 - 60:51)
Starly likes to eat some chair chair be (60:48 - 60:54)
chair you be chair you be so we have (60:51 - 60:58)
birds eating fruit like and I guess (60:54 - 61:01)
probably seeds another seeds and chair (60:58 - 61:03)
do you think this is it not as it's a (61:01 - 61:05)
cherry sure Gary yeah you think there's (61:03 - 61:08)
like a pit in there Oh like a like a (61:05 - 61:13)
core I think it's yeah I would assume so (61:08 - 61:16)
and we have birds eating bugs which also (61:13 - 61:17)
makes sense (61:16 - 61:20)
mm-hmm I don't know about the execute (61:17 - 61:22)
though what they're eggs (61:20 - 61:24)
I think that's true but like Debray wait (61:22 - 61:25)
actually it doesn't make sense in (61:24 - 61:29)
retrospect no Pidgeotto what is it like (61:25 - 61:32)
no Pokemon look wait a second do birds (61:29 - 61:38)
eat eggs yes do a lot of the predatory (61:32 - 61:41)
birds one okay all right that's fair I (61:38 - 61:42)
didn't research but I bet like Noctowl (61:41 - 61:46)
eats reddit as oh for sure absolutely (61:42 - 61:48)
absolutely in the Sun and Moon anime (61:46 - 61:51)
Rowlett tries to eat the flower thing (61:48 - 61:54)
that evolved on sweet bounce sweet yes (61:51 - 61:56)
burp there was a lot of birdmen history (61:54 - 61:59)
here so birds part to fire fetches (61:56 - 62:01)
hunted for food and it makes a delicious (61:59 - 62:03)
meal this was something that was (62:01 - 62:05)
discussed in the anime and I actually (62:03 - 62:07)
believe here in blue that was referenced (62:05 - 62:10)
by an NPC a novel carry their overhunted (62:07 - 62:12)
I think that was the first instance of (62:10 - 62:16)
like a cooked turkey like a like an (62:12 - 62:20)
image of a cooked fetch is not a turkey (62:16 - 62:24)
yeah yeah duck I mean cooked duck like (62:20 - 62:28)
the image was a cooked bird I see I'm (62:24 - 62:29)
following (62:28 - 62:30)
and I was like oh okay when I was a kid (62:29 - 62:32)
I was like okay farts giving but in (62:30 - 62:35)
retrospect that's horrifying (62:32 - 62:39)
thanks fetch no I like the first one (62:35 - 62:42)
March is much better much better I'm (62:39 - 62:47)
gonna make farts farts making a thing (62:42 - 62:47)
this year (62:47 - 62:52)
Amanda buzz preys on cubone and Meowth (62:47 - 62:54)
can be say is seen chasing piggy at (62:52 - 62:56)
various points on the beach what that (62:54 - 62:59)
means is Pokemon snap where the beach (62:56 - 63:01)
area where Meowth is consistently (62:59 - 63:05)
chasing piggies okay would one would (63:01 - 63:07)
assume to eat maybe or just to be (63:05 - 63:09)
friends with they could be friends maybe (63:07 - 63:11)
they just want to be friends the beach (63:09 - 63:14)
party I don't know if the beach party (63:11 - 63:20)
bug Pokemon may be the best is the best (63:14 - 63:21)
I don't know professors are okay with (63:20 - 63:23)
that miltank that's pretty good - pretty (63:21 - 63:26)
good Combee and vespiqueen gather nectar (63:23 - 63:28)
from flowers to produce honey and (63:26 - 63:31)
various various other things moth um (63:28 - 63:33)
happens to steal that honey which is (63:31 - 63:34)
something I didn't know until I did a (63:33 - 63:36)
little bit of research is that a common (63:34 - 63:40)
moth thing that mom steal I don't know (63:36 - 63:42)
if that's a real-life thing I feel like (63:40 - 63:44)
it has to be right like there's a lot of (63:42 - 63:46)
the stuff is based on real world unless (63:44 - 63:48)
there's like a certain type of moth like (63:46 - 63:51)
a big the honey Steeler moth yeah yeah (63:48 - 63:54)
got it endangered I hear Indian rare the (63:51 - 64:01)
rare giving so I heat more praise upon (63:54 - 64:04)
Durant beyond reasons yeah yeah (64:01 - 64:05)
want to explain why because it's (64:04 - 64:08)
basically an anteater yeah and an ant (64:05 - 64:14)
alright it's a fire ant eater there's (64:08 - 64:18)
also like seviper and zangoose yes yeah (64:14 - 64:19)
they prey on each other another very (64:18 - 64:21)
common is their rivalry (64:19 - 64:23)
is there more rivalries in the Pokemon (64:21 - 64:26)
world I mean young goose was supposed to (64:23 - 64:29)
be much like how it was in Hawaii was (64:26 - 64:31)
supposed to be bred in to take care of (64:29 - 64:33)
the Rattata problem but exactly what's (64:31 - 64:35)
happening in Hawaii now all the impetus (64:33 - 64:39)
that they released in Hawaii said oh the (64:35 - 64:41)
rats are really too hard to hunt so (64:39 - 64:43)
we're just gonna eat all the birds (64:41 - 64:45)
oh-ho there's actually happening in (64:43 - 64:46)
Hawaii that's how that's why that's in (64:45 - 64:48)
Sun and Moon they brought them over to (64:46 - 64:51)
take care of the Rattata who moved to (64:48 - 64:55)
the night cuz uh they don't dwell in all (64:51 - 64:57)
the Mongoose hunt all the birds this is (64:55 - 64:59)
incredible it's the but that's the best (64:57 - 65:00)
this podcast is gonna get this hour is (64:59 - 65:03)
that fact right there go out tell people (65:00 - 65:06)
about the Mongoose problem in Hawaii (65:03 - 65:09)
finally heracross feeds on the sack of (65:06 - 65:11)
Bulbasaur and sucks that sweet sweet (65:09 - 65:14)
nectar out of bubble service both source (65:11 - 65:17)
a cold SAP yeah yes (65:14 - 65:19)
so this is actually from the well like (65:17 - 65:20)
all these gifs they're from the anime (65:19 - 65:23)
and I like that in parentheses you have (65:20 - 65:24)
even in the heat of battle (65:23 - 65:26)
yes now that I put that in parenthesis (65:24 - 65:30)
from RIE myself that Ash's heracross was (65:26 - 65:34)
very didn't care at all about the battle (65:30 - 65:36)
if it was if it was nectar time it was (65:34 - 65:40)
hungry thirsty multiple points in the (65:36 - 65:42)
anime this hair inaudible points docked (65:40 - 65:45)
me to get that sweet sweet nectar juice (65:42 - 65:49)
and that's what's important priorities (65:45 - 65:53)
in life it's it's a glorious image (65:49 - 65:57)
it's an image it's certainly a Vegas it (65:53 - 66:01)
is definitely something because she's (65:57 - 66:02)
just standing by come on (66:01 - 66:05)
I mean we're picking she's not sure (66:02 - 66:07)
which side to join I mean they're all (66:05 - 66:11)
friends Yugi is horrified we've we (66:07 - 66:13)
talked about a couple of the bug Pokemon (66:11 - 66:14)
like warm pool and Caterpie earlier but (66:13 - 66:17)
I would imagine that a lot of the bug (66:14 - 66:19)
Pokemon are not in a good position in (66:17 - 66:22)
the Pokemon world yeah not looking not (66:19 - 66:24)
looking too good for them if they keep (66:22 - 66:28)
making birds yeah whoo they keep making (66:24 - 66:30)
bird keep making birds every generation (66:28 - 66:32)
new birds new Birds what what hunts a (66:30 - 66:36)
bird more bird more birds again other (66:32 - 66:39)
words like braver airy yeah yeah (66:36 - 66:42)
yeah man what was it talonflame yeah (66:39 - 66:43)
talonflame (66:42 - 66:47)
pokemon eating other pokemon this is a (66:43 - 66:49)
pretty good shift I really just want to (66:47 - 66:54)
get entertained just look up Pokemon (66:49 - 66:55)
eating each other and there's a lot of (66:54 - 66:56)
people that don't like for the Pokemon (66:55 - 66:58)
anime but come on after everything I've (66:56 - 67:03)
shown you guys one of the solid source (66:58 - 67:04)
of entertainment I technically don't (67:03 - 67:06)
watch the anime but this is really (67:04 - 67:08)
selling me on it (67:06 - 67:08)
it's both it's actually both sigh answer (67:09 - 67:15)
that question again I didn't know this (67:14 - 67:17)
until I did a little research but when (67:15 - 67:21)
the Grimer became a lowland Grimer (67:17 - 67:24)
they started feeding on trubbish and (67:21 - 67:28)
Garr boater in the a lowland region hmm (67:24 - 67:30)
normal trash was not good enough for (67:28 - 67:33)
them so they literally ate they eat (67:30 - 67:35)
other Pokemon they need that sweet (67:33 - 67:38)
living trash they want the trash that (67:35 - 67:41)
malicious living Trish (67:38 - 67:43)
in the animation relax attempted to eat (67:41 - 67:45)
a gloom (67:43 - 67:48)
let's workout I don't think it was (67:45 - 67:50)
success I don't think that's exactly not (67:48 - 67:53)
and also in the anime and Exploud it (67:50 - 67:56)
tries to eat and acts you which explode (67:53 - 67:58)
and strikes me as a non carnivore (67:56 - 68:01)
Pokemon you think so it's got a huge (67:58 - 68:03)
mouth it's a real real big mouth yeah (68:01 - 68:06)
but it has like a big stereo and it said (68:03 - 68:08)
and it doesn't need to eat yeah that (68:06 - 68:10)
screams to me like vegetarian one of the (68:08 - 68:13)
only a little bit only ate electric (68:10 - 68:16)
pokemon that would make a lot of sense (68:13 - 68:18)
unfortunately it's already eating axe (68:16 - 68:21)
you know that cetera and both kingler (68:18 - 68:22)
and omastar (68:21 - 68:26)
they prey on shelter crack open that (68:22 - 68:28)
shellfish okay that makes a lot of sense (68:26 - 68:35)
that makes it yeah uh you skip the sorry (68:28 - 68:35)
go ahead (68:35 - 68:40)
no you're good Morini they uh like (68:35 - 68:42)
zangoose and seviper they are rivals (68:40 - 68:44)
with corsola the only differences (68:42 - 68:46)
corsola doesn't fight back and just gets (68:44 - 68:50)
eaten and the dex entry is that's pretty (68:46 - 68:52)
terrifying really trigger buying it's (68:50 - 68:54)
also something about leaving remains of (68:52 - 68:59)
course lacrosse the beach it's very dark (68:54 - 69:01)
it's a little dark candy and maybe I'm (68:59 - 69:02)
mistaken and I haven't played Sunday (69:01 - 69:04)
moon in a couple months and I haven't (69:02 - 69:06)
completed my decks I apologize but can't (69:04 - 69:08)
the only isn't the only way to get (69:06 - 69:11)
Marini is SOS battle with reversal oh (69:08 - 69:13)
yeah man that's so cool and it's real (69:11 - 69:18)
hard I spent a lot of time yeah and if (69:13 - 69:22)
you no no no man I don't have the (69:18 - 69:24)
patience for that let's get to the good (69:22 - 69:28)
stuff humans eating Pokemon fYI I'm (69:24 - 69:30)
pretty sure Ash's mom and mr. mime are a (69:28 - 69:33)
couple would you stop you have been (69:30 - 69:38)
trying to sell this all day we have the (69:33 - 69:42)
official word out on sun and moon they (69:38 - 69:43)
get pretty close (69:42 - 69:45)
weird beach scenes with those two yeah (69:43 - 69:47)
they're enjoying their vacation (69:45 - 69:49)
slowpoke tails let's talk about those (69:47 - 69:51)
alright yeah they actually had an (69:49 - 69:54)
epiphany about this when we were away so (69:51 - 69:56)
there we were talking about the how (69:54 - 69:58)
we read that how you're supposed to eat (69:56 - 70:01)
slowpoke tails is there supposed to be (69:58 - 70:03)
lightly sucked on which we were like (70:01 - 70:06)
what what does that mean I don't think (70:03 - 70:10)
what now I think that it's supposed to (70:06 - 70:13)
mimic like bone marrow and how you eat (70:10 - 70:17)
bone marrow mmm which is you suck on it (70:13 - 70:20)
lately or you use a very tiny fork a (70:17 - 70:22)
very tiny spoon and you or a spoon you (70:20 - 70:24)
dig it out of there yeah and it's really (70:22 - 70:31)
delicious we research man but deep in (70:24 - 70:34)
the slowpoke well let me tell you it's (70:31 - 70:35)
like a 12 year old place (70:34 - 70:37)
gold and silver that's kind of a (70:35 - 70:40)
horrifying yeah of like all these (70:37 - 70:42)
slowpokes with no tails Team Rocket (70:40 - 70:44)
and that's hustling you know well some (70:42 - 70:47)
we're just hacking them up but I mean do (70:44 - 70:50)
you think like goldenrod festivals they (70:47 - 70:52)
have carts full slowpoke tails for the (70:50 - 70:54)
children like is there a slowpoke vendor (70:52 - 70:55)
yeah and then it comes from everybody's (70:54 - 70:57)
asking where they're coming right it's (70:55 - 70:59)
like is that sounds like the cigarettes (70:57 - 71:02)
of the pokemon world like yeah everyone (70:59 - 71:03)
kind of enjoys it like they all know (71:02 - 71:05)
it's it's bad for me (71:03 - 71:07)
like you know I would guess it's (71:05 - 71:09)
probably similar to like what's that (71:07 - 71:14)
like like pate like duck liver what like (71:09 - 71:18)
duck liver it like pate is very not let (71:14 - 71:20)
me tell you on fetch fetch giving we're (71:18 - 71:25)
not having any it's it's a delicacy it (71:20 - 71:28)
is or goose liver sorry (71:25 - 71:31)
and it the way that they they make it is (71:28 - 71:35)
very inhumane so I would assume it's (71:31 - 71:38)
similar to that like but don't seem that (71:35 - 71:40)
bothered by the fact that they don't (71:38 - 71:43)
have tails in the game its slowpoke they (71:40 - 71:45)
don't seem bothered by anything okay (71:43 - 71:48)
that is accurate far-fetched which we (71:45 - 71:50)
talked about earlier it is cooked with (71:48 - 71:52)
its own leek which i think is important (71:50 - 71:55)
really yeah it's so sad well that's the (71:52 - 71:57)
tale that it comes from that if you're (71:55 - 72:00)
super hungry lost in the woods the woods (71:57 - 72:02)
will provide by providing you not only a (72:00 - 72:05)
bird to eat but with its own seasoning (72:02 - 72:07)
cuz so sick that's why the tale is (72:05 - 72:09)
far-fetched (72:07 - 72:09)
what if what if you know you find the (72:10 - 72:15)
far fetch Li CLIs is it just not know (72:12 - 72:16)
then you're done (72:15 - 72:18)
yes now we're destined to not eat it (72:16 - 72:20)
it's just a duck at that point it's just (72:18 - 72:26)
a duck cedrus fins and bones are used in (72:20 - 72:28)
herbal medicine not really food related (72:26 - 72:29)
but I just thought it was interesting (72:28 - 72:32)
that they did talk about mmm cedras (72:29 - 72:33)
bones yeah (72:32 - 72:37)
is that like shark fin soup I yeah like (72:33 - 72:41)
maybe how they use sea creatures yeah (72:37 - 72:43)
you know like perfume and stuff like (72:41 - 72:45)
that not not included in the suggesting (72:43 - 72:47)
on this slide on the podcast there was (72:45 - 72:49)
debate about it Pokemon bleed or not or (72:47 - 72:52)
Pokemon that blood and the only (72:49 - 72:55)
reference in all of the 700 million (72:52 - 72:58)
Pokemon that exists is that gold gold (72:55 - 73:01)
bats pokedex says that it does feast on (72:58 - 73:03)
blood of humans and pokémon yeah that (73:01 - 73:05)
does confirm that Pokemon do have lost (73:03 - 73:08)
samples not have blood I'm assuming (73:05 - 73:12)
ditto does not mean you don't know that (73:08 - 73:15)
maybe what if I transformed into blood (73:12 - 73:20)
then what transform into buildings (73:15 - 73:20)
octillery Magikarp chair ruby terribie (73:21 - 73:32)
they have all they're all referenced as (73:27 - 73:35)
being (73:32 - 73:37)
possibly eated but never confirmed (73:35 - 73:39)
throughout all the research I found in (73:37 - 73:40)
India you could point to Magikarp in (73:39 - 73:44)
look at the anime and go that ash and (73:40 - 73:47)
Brock fantasized about eating a Magikarp (73:44 - 73:49)
when they were stranded off the SS an (73:47 - 73:51)
but they don't actually eat the Magikarp (73:49 - 73:54)
and I believe it was misty that told (73:51 - 73:55)
them that they couldn't eat a Magikarp (73:54 - 73:57)
if they wanted to because it's it's (73:55 - 74:01)
nothing but scale is incorrect but your (73:57 - 74:05)
favorite fish bascule n' masculine (74:01 - 74:09)
delicious at least has the most (74:05 - 74:11)
delicious oh really yes it is listed as (74:09 - 74:14)
the most delicious d and you hated it (74:11 - 74:17)
what is the most delicious human fish (74:14 - 74:28)
would like I've been another is a video (74:17 - 74:33)
game about human fish but give me a give (74:28 - 74:36)
me the human fish I don't know it's like (74:33 - 74:39)
go to your real words like what yeah (74:36 - 74:41)
like what's a good real world like the (74:39 - 74:43)
best we're in Minnesota so I think we're (74:41 - 74:46)
legally mandated to say walleye walleye (74:43 - 74:50)
I don't know walleye okay I mean (74:46 - 74:50)
what is it in Wisconsin cod chase maybe (74:53 - 75:02)
yeah the old cheese fish giant cues the (74:57 - 75:04)
cheese surprisingly I don't think (75:02 - 75:06)
anybody in Wisconsin eats their fish (75:04 - 75:08)
with cheese now you don't know that (75:06 - 75:15)
you're right I don't know that uh this (75:08 - 75:17)
is pretty much it though we're ending on (75:15 - 75:18)
a human eating Pokemon was there (75:17 - 75:21)
anything else that stood out (75:18 - 75:21)
I mean I probably does a lot of this (75:21 - 75:26)
stuff was cut just due to the the (75:24 - 75:30)
projector here but the good ol projector (75:26 - 75:32)
situation but I don't think so I feel (75:30 - 75:34)
like they're more like fruit was it (75:32 - 75:36)
we're talking about before has fruit (75:34 - 75:40)
yeah banana bananas didn't somebody say (75:36 - 75:43)
earlier today that Chikorita is like (75:40 - 75:45)
supposed to be a pear it's a pair of (75:43 - 75:48)
dinosaur pear dinosaur it is it looks (75:45 - 75:50)
like a pear it's paradise or (75:48 - 75:52)
what would you think if is the seasoning (75:50 - 75:54)
what do you think would eat well (75:52 - 75:58)
actually true here's my question (75:54 - 76:00)
I add there there you know seven hundred (75:58 - 76:02)
some Pokemon I'm assuming people are (76:00 - 76:06)
eating tauros and and miltank as they (76:02 - 76:11)
would eat like cows yeah yeah beef right (76:06 - 76:13)
mainly so that if you look at like the (76:11 - 76:16)
Ducks as like far fetch sour people eat (76:13 - 76:24)
inside ducks maybe no okay so it is not (76:16 - 76:27)
like the duck that you would see in like (76:24 - 76:31)
apart the the pond in a Milwaukee Park I (76:27 - 76:33)
suppose that makes sense (76:31 - 76:37)
it's like the the best (76:33 - 76:37)
Psyduck I'm assuming is like the the (76:37 - 76:42)
duck that you see in the pond at the (76:40 - 76:44)
park that right probably (76:42 - 76:45)
so you're thinking that's giving you a (76:44 - 76:47)
headache is too gross for anybody yeah (76:45 - 76:49)
no one want to see that so then you turn (76:47 - 76:50)
around go in the forest and find (76:49 - 76:51)
yourself our fish you know you have to (76:50 - 76:55)
get lost first what is okay I'm going in (76:51 - 76:57)
the forest there's like a 98% chance (76:55 - 77:00)
yeah absolutely accurate I was gonna say (76:57 - 77:02)
back to mr. mom what was mr. mom eaten (77:00 - 77:04)
human food nothing but human food he's (77:02 - 77:06)
making something probably cooking a far (77:04 - 77:12)
fetch yeah maybe he's got a face like (77:06 - 77:15)
you've eaten a far fish face of (77:12 - 77:18)
satisfaction right there (77:15 - 77:18)
let's do some more trivia so again don't (77:18 - 77:22)
shout it out if you know just raise your (77:21 - 77:24)
hand I'll call on you but in the Pokedex (77:22 - 77:26)
pokemon are classified as certain things (77:24 - 77:29)
so like swirlix is classified as the (77:26 - 77:31)
cotton candy pokemon if I'm not mistaken (77:29 - 77:33)
butter Frese classified as the but the (77:31 - 77:35)
butterfly pokémon only one pokemon in (77:33 - 77:37)
