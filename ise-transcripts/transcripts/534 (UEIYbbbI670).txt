Polished them and my mouth is unhappy (0:44 - 0:47)

and it's like 40 minutes out of my I (0:47 - 0:52)
paid them to torture my mouth which is (0:50 - 0:55)
like why am I in this relationship (0:52 - 0:56)
I feel like that's our relationship with (0:55 - 0:58)
Pokemon go (0:56 - 1:00)

I'm headed to twitchcon (2:07 - 2:12)
so by the time this episode goes up I'll (2:09 - 2:13)
probably be on a plane back from (2:12 - 2:15)
twitchcon (2:13 - 2:17)
um (2:15 - 2:19)
yeah I've been traveling a lot so I was (2:17 - 2:21)
like we're just recorded early and then (2:19 - 2:22)
don't have to worry about putting will (2:21 - 2:25)
in charge will has a life (2:22 - 2:27)
uh and then I was like (2:25 - 2:30)
there's probably gonna be Pokemon what (2:27 - 2:31)
happens is whenever we record early (2:30 - 2:33)
there's gonna be Pokemon news there is (2:31 - 2:36)
apparently there is uh as of us (2:33 - 2:39)
recording this there's a new trailer (2:36 - 2:41)
supposed to drop tomorrow (2:39 - 2:42)
so (2:41 - 2:43)
um (2:42 - 2:45)
if you're listening to this episode and (2:43 - 2:45)
you're like why didn't they talk about (2:45 - 2:47)
the new trailer it's because we recorded (2:45 - 2:50)
this the day before uh but if you're (2:47 - 2:51)
listening to this and you want to hear (2:50 - 2:53)
my thoughts I will probably still stream (2:51 - 2:55)
that like two minute trailer on Twitch (2:53 - 2:57)
probably talk about it for like 10 (2:55 - 2:58)
minutes and then throw that up on (2:57 - 2:59)
YouTube so if you're listening to this (2:58 - 3:00)
right now and you want to know my (2:59 - 3:01)
thoughts on the trailer that'll probably (3:00 - 3:03)
be up on YouTube by the time you're (3:01 - 3:05)
listening to this podcast so (3:03 - 3:09)
uh we do have some Pokemon nose new nose (3:05 - 3:11)
nose pass we have some Pokemon nose pass (3:09 - 3:13)
we have some Pokemon news to go through (3:11 - 3:15)
not a whole lot because uh again I'm (3:13 - 3:16)
traveling so we're gonna try to keep the (3:15 - 3:19)
show to about an hour (3:16 - 3:20)
um but we're gonna start with some (3:19 - 3:24)
Pokemon Go News (3:20 - 3:26)
uh first which we haven't even like (3:24 - 3:28)
talked about Pokemon go like two weeks (3:26 - 3:30)
which I think goes into hand in hand (3:28 - 3:32)
with like Greg saying he's not playing (3:30 - 3:33)
because like Fashion Week happened and (3:32 - 3:35)
then what was the week before that was (3:33 - 3:38)
like psychic week or something yeah sure (3:35 - 3:40)
uh I played a lot of Pokemon go when I (3:38 - 3:42)
was in South Korea and then I got back (3:40 - 3:45)
and I was like I am I'm good I'm all (3:42 - 3:46)
right (3:45 - 3:49)
it was wild because I literally (3:46 - 3:52)
somebody had posted something like I saw (3:49 - 3:55)
a daily incense post on Twitter and my (3:52 - 3:57)
brain went (3:55 - 3:59)
all right we used to play that game (3:57 - 4:01)
huh (3:59 - 4:02)
well okay (4:01 - 4:03)
um (4:02 - 4:05)
I think that for the fashion week they (4:03 - 4:08)
didn't do a very good job of like (4:05 - 4:09)
highlighting the fact that a lot of (4:08 - 4:11)
these fashion Pokemon can now be shiny (4:09 - 4:12)
as well like in their fashion forms (4:11 - 4:15)
because I didn't hear like I didn't know (4:12 - 4:18)
until I started seeing people posting (4:15 - 4:20)
shiny for free and then I was like wait (4:18 - 4:23)
wait what like I couldn't I should have (4:20 - 4:26)
been catching forever this whole time (4:23 - 4:27)
rather than just looking at it and being (4:26 - 4:29)
like I can't do anything with that see I (4:27 - 4:31)
had the I had the opposite thought of (4:29 - 4:33)
like I've been traveling and I didn't (4:31 - 4:36)
have any fur-froof because I deleted (4:33 - 4:37)
them all and I was like I could be (4:36 - 4:40)
changing these ferproof forms all in the (4:37 - 4:42)
country (4:40 - 4:44)
oh man I need to get that into because (4:42 - 4:46)
I'm I just figured out I'm gonna go to (4:44 - 4:48)
Japan in 2024 (4:46 - 4:50)
um for a conference there's a (4:48 - 4:54)
international Congress of Entomology is (4:50 - 4:57)
in Kyoto in 2024 and I just put it in a (4:54 - 5:00)
grant that I'm gonna go so (4:57 - 5:01)
um I need to get as many furfur as (5:00 - 5:03)
possible right now they got they got (5:01 - 5:06)
different bugs over there yeah yeah (5:03 - 5:08)
they have a lot of different bugs over (5:06 - 5:09)
there (5:08 - 5:11)
it's a lot of different bugs (5:09 - 5:14)
and they don't speak English either no (5:11 - 5:15)
there's this that's why we all go with (5:14 - 5:18)
Latin so yep (5:15 - 5:18)
um so uh the first event here this off (5:19 - 5:24)
Pokemon go live.com get cosmic with our (5:21 - 5:26)
evolving Stars event to be fair it's not (5:24 - 5:28)
that there wasn't anything to do in (5:26 - 5:29)
Pokemon go for the last couple weeks (5:28 - 5:32)
there have been (5:29 - 5:32)
um (5:32 - 5:34)
so they're moving from Fashion Week to (5:32 - 5:37)
evolving Stars the story of Lights the (5:34 - 5:40)
season of light story unfolds you can (5:37 - 5:43)
continue to follow cosmic's story a new (5:40 - 5:45)
part of the season-long special research (5:43 - 5:48)
will unlock complete it to take another (5:45 - 5:50)
step on your adventure with cosmog (5:48 - 5:53)
cosmoa moment make its debut trainers (5:50 - 5:56)
will be able to evolve cosmog into Cosmo (5:53 - 5:59)
by using 25 Cosmo candy don't worry (5:56 - 6:01)
about evolving your only cosmog rumor (5:59 - 6:03)
has it that you'll have an opportunity (6:01 - 6:07)
to encounter an additional cosmog in the (6:03 - 6:09)
distant future (6:07 - 6:12)
uh there will be a mega Gyarados raid (6:09 - 6:12)
day (6:12 - 6:16)
from Saturday uh from (6:12 - 6:18)
Saturday October 8th this will already (6:16 - 6:20)
be over by the time it goes up uh from (6:18 - 6:23)
two to five mega Gyarados will be more (6:20 - 6:24)
frequently in raids you will get five (6:23 - 6:26)
bonus rate passes you'll have an (6:24 - 6:28)
increased chance of getting shiny (6:26 - 6:30)
Gyarados I don't know what that means uh (6:28 - 6:32)
I'm assuming that's like a one in 20 (6:30 - 6:33)
because like (6:32 - 6:36)
Mega Pokemon aren't one in 20. (6:33 - 6:38)
so I guess I guess that's probably what (6:36 - 6:39)
it means (6:38 - 6:42)
uh more Pokemon appearing in the wild uh (6:39 - 6:44)
people like list here's your list Kakuna (6:42 - 6:46)
Pidgeotto Poliwhirl cadabra Haunter (6:44 - 6:50)
Rhyhorn Sidra Scyther Evie swine up ralt (6:46 - 6:53)
duskal Tynamo Litwick and Helioptile (6:50 - 6:56)
will be appearing more frequently in the (6:53 - 6:57)
wild (6:56 - 7:01)
I why is it Kakuna Pidgeotto Poliwhirl (6:57 - 7:03)
cadabra Hunter none of these can be (7:01 - 7:06)
shinies the ones the previous forms can (7:03 - 7:08)
be I don't (7:06 - 7:11)
know what they're doing here (7:08 - 7:14)
um I keep trying to like somehow attach (7:11 - 7:16)
them to light and I'm like (7:14 - 7:21)
no that doesn't work either (7:16 - 7:21)
no they're like gen 1 Pokemon or two (7:21 - 7:28)
boring so let's give them middle forms (7:26 - 7:30)
finally but not make them shiny (7:28 - 7:32)
I mean Pidgeotto if they're because (7:30 - 7:33)
they're (7:32 - 7:34)
um (7:33 - 7:36)
they're trying to draw attention to the (7:34 - 7:38)
fact that we do light pollution and that (7:36 - 7:39)
when we turn our lights on at night and (7:38 - 7:42)
leave our lights on at night we are (7:39 - 7:46)
disrupting the migrations of (7:42 - 7:50)
um birds so I'm sure (7:46 - 7:50)
other than that I don't understand this (7:50 - 7:55)
listener okay Niantic hey with wig we (7:52 - 7:59)
now know that Niantic knows about (7:55 - 8:01)
science with convergent evolution and (7:59 - 8:03)
stuff like that and so I'm even though I (8:01 - 8:04)
hate Wiglet (8:03 - 8:07)
um all here for the science but I think (8:04 - 8:09)
you're covering up the fact that all (8:07 - 8:11)
birds were replaced by robots in the (8:09 - 8:14)
1950s yeah so they we did they just need (8:11 - 8:16)
to update the software and that will fix (8:14 - 8:18)
the light pollution migration issue that (8:16 - 8:20)
would be awesome that software update (8:18 - 8:23)
needs to get through yeah (8:20 - 8:23)
we're excited about Helioptile here I (8:24 - 8:27)
haven't had a lot of I mean it's not (8:26 - 8:28)
shiny but (8:27 - 8:30)
don't have a ton of those hasn't that (8:28 - 8:32)
been in the game before yeah yeah this (8:30 - 8:34)
is the only new thing about this is is (8:32 - 8:37)
Cosmo which 25 is really low (8:34 - 8:39)
this is they're going to charge you a (8:37 - 8:41)
big old 100 to get that to sogali or (8:39 - 8:44)
lunala okay walk with that friend (8:41 - 8:48)
because you can't catch it but also like (8:44 - 8:49)
what (8:48 - 8:53)
are our I mean like Cosmo does evolve (8:49 - 8:56)
into solgaleo or lunala right but aren't (8:53 - 8:57)
they not just gonna stick those into (8:56 - 9:00)
raids at some point to get yeah dollars (8:57 - 9:03)
yeah so is it even worth evolving the (9:00 - 9:05)
cause you're probably better off keeping (9:03 - 9:08)
it as a cosmog or cosmoam because (9:05 - 9:10)
they said here they're giving us another (9:08 - 9:12)
one who knows I don't know if that's (9:10 - 9:15)
like behind us so the question is if (9:12 - 9:17)
there's going to be like a time travel (9:15 - 9:18)
event (9:17 - 9:20)
and that's what they're hinting at like (9:18 - 9:23)
we're gonna like the next is the season (9:20 - 9:26)
of time and then there's gonna be a (9:23 - 9:28)
whole thing about Celebi taking you in (9:26 - 9:30)
throughout time is that the distant (9:28 - 9:31)
future (9:30 - 9:35)
because it feels weird that they say in (9:31 - 9:38)
the distant future and not just in the (9:35 - 9:39)
future (9:38 - 9:41)
or is it that they're not going to put (9:39 - 9:43)
these in raids like this is going to be (9:41 - 9:44)
the only way to get them and the only (9:43 - 9:46)
thing yeah that would be like Niantic (9:44 - 9:48)
hates money (9:46 - 9:48)
uh cosmog in raids only like because (9:50 - 9:56)
they want you to do all this stuff to (9:54 - 9:58)
get to evolve them (9:56 - 10:00)
um I don't think they would put cosmog (9:58 - 10:03)
in raids because that would be easier to (10:00 - 10:05)
farm as like a solo player and they want (10:03 - 10:07)
people to (10:05 - 10:10)
or they make you do raids for Ultra (10:07 - 10:11)
beasts and when you do the raids for (10:10 - 10:13)
Ultra beasts you get cosmon candy as (10:11 - 10:15)
well (10:13 - 10:17)
that would require new programming that (10:15 - 10:19)
I don't think Niantic is yeah that's not (10:17 - 10:22)
a copy and paste so cool speaking of (10:19 - 10:23)
grades (10:22 - 10:26)
by the time this podcast goes up even (10:23 - 10:29)
tall should be leaving raids uh Xerneas (10:26 - 10:33)
should be appearing in raids (10:29 - 10:35)
um okay I'm putting it out there when (10:33 - 10:38)
Xerneas goes into raids (10:35 - 10:41)
let me know because I do want a shiny (10:38 - 10:42)
zombies I don't care about bacon bird (10:41 - 10:46)
but I kind of like shiny rainbow deer (10:42 - 10:50)
so just FYI people (10:46 - 10:51)
hit me up I haven't been playing Pokemon (10:50 - 10:53)

minutes after it was over and completed (11:04 - 11:08)
so yeah don't trust go to get me (11:06 - 11:09)
anything on time (11:08 - 11:11)
uh obviously we've covered this news (11:09 - 11:12)
before but (11:11 - 11:14)
um just a reminder with Community Day is (11:12 - 11:17)
coming up uh Saturday October 15th from (11:14 - 11:20)
two to five local time let look will (11:17 - 11:22)
appear more in the wild if you evolve (11:20 - 11:25)
lamp it into Chandelure you will get the (11:22 - 11:27)
charge attack polti Geist (11:25 - 11:30)
ERS (11:27 - 11:30)
gotta be really excited produces a new (11:30 - 11:37)
Pokemon and throws it at people yeah but (11:33 - 11:38)
it's like when you see a chandelier in a (11:37 - 11:39)
house and you're like oh look at that (11:38 - 11:41)
[ __ ] to learn you're like oh I got (11:39 - 11:44)
Pokemon with my brain oops (11:41 - 11:46)
it was a chandelier though because like (11:44 - 11:49)
nothing's gonna kill me you got three (11:46 - 11:52)
times the catching XP you get two times (11:49 - 11:55)
to catch candy you get two times the uh (11:52 - 11:58)
XL catch candy if you're 31 and higher (11:55 - 12:00)
lure modules will last three hours (11:58 - 12:02)
incense will last three hours snapshot (12:00 - 12:05)
for a surprise one additional special (12:02 - 12:07)
trade for a maximum of two during the (12:05 - 12:10)
day trades will be 50 percent less (12:07 - 12:11)
Stardust (12:10 - 12:14)
they are doing the four star raid (12:11 - 12:17)
battles again where Lampent will appear (12:14 - 12:19)
in four star raids you can only join (12:17 - 12:21)
these using remote rate passes or (12:19 - 12:23)
premium right sorry raid passes or (12:21 - 12:26)
premium rate pass remote raid passes (12:23 - 12:28)
cannot be used (12:26 - 12:30)
um and then obviously when you knock out (12:28 - 12:32)
the lampet uh (12:30 - 12:35)
uh Litwick will appear in a 300 meter (12:32 - 12:37)
radius around the gym host that hosted (12:35 - 12:39)
The Raid for 30 minutes (12:37 - 12:41)
so you still have the same odds as a (12:39 - 12:44)
shiny one uh you just don't have the (12:41 - 12:46)
bonuses we talked about so no three (12:44 - 12:50)
times catch no double candy but still (12:46 - 12:52)
shininess (12:50 - 12:54)
um (12:52 - 12:56)
we did this at the mall America Greg and (12:54 - 12:57)
I know we talked about a little bit but (12:56 - 13:00)
the the star ravia well it was it was (12:57 - 13:04)
Starly and Staravia and I will say like (13:00 - 13:07)
uh the privilege of being able to play (13:04 - 13:09)
at the Mall of America is number one (13:07 - 13:11)
amazing place to play but number two (13:09 - 13:14)
like I actually did it where I focused (13:11 - 13:17)
on just catching (13:14 - 13:19)
um and like I didn't care about the like (13:17 - 13:22)
shiny uh I just wanted all the bonuses (13:19 - 13:24)
and then when it ended I was like cool (13:22 - 13:27)
now I can like shiny hunt because I'm I (13:24 - 13:28)
was there for more than three hours (13:27 - 13:31)
whereas like (13:28 - 13:34)
how I used to play when I didn't care (13:31 - 13:37)
about XP because I was like level 40 and (13:34 - 13:40)
there was no reason to get XP I would (13:37 - 13:41)
just I wouldn't catch anything I would (13:40 - 13:44)
just tap is it shiny no tap is it shiny (13:41 - 13:45)
no and I wasn't really getting any of (13:44 - 13:46)
the bonus stuff (13:45 - 13:49)
I was I was a naive player not thinking (13:46 - 13:52)
they would raise the level cap (13:49 - 13:54)
they should erase the level cap but (13:52 - 13:55)
there still wasn't a whole lot of reason (13:54 - 14:00)
to do it yeah yeah that's true so like (13:55 - 14:02)
when we were done with us uh Starley (14:00 - 14:04)
Community Day I was like oh I only got (14:02 - 14:06)
like five shinies which like some people (14:04 - 14:08)
are like wow five is a lot or some (14:06 - 14:09)
people are like oh five is nothing but (14:08 - 14:10)
like (14:09 - 14:12)
after (14:10 - 14:14)
I was there for another hour (14:12 - 14:16)
doing when we did like what like three (14:14 - 14:19)
star rabios or whatever and I got like (14:16 - 14:21)
another five in that hour but it was (14:19 - 14:23)
like cool because I didn't have to worry (14:21 - 14:25)
about like (14:23 - 14:27)
I was able to focus on like the whatever (14:25 - 14:29)
the bonus was I think it was Stardust (14:27 - 14:31)
for Starly or something (14:29 - 14:34)
of course that requires a really good (14:31 - 14:37)
place to play which mall America does uh (14:34 - 14:39)
but I I don't know there was a lot of (14:37 - 14:40)
people like the first one they did was (14:39 - 14:42)
bad because like it apparently they did (14:40 - 14:45)
was bad and now that these eggs pretty (14:42 - 14:47)
much pop pretty shortly after the event (14:45 - 14:49)
within like five minutes that's much (14:47 - 14:50)
better (14:49 - 14:53)
and I still think this is (14:50 - 14:55)
I guess it's better than nothing which (14:53 - 14:57)
is probably not giving Niantic praise (14:55 - 14:59)
but like again (14:57 - 15:01)
if you can't make Community day and you (14:59 - 15:04)
and like two other people (15:01 - 15:06)
run to a gym down the street from your (15:04 - 15:08)
house you have a mini Community for 30 (15:06 - 15:11)
minutes for you know your free raid pass (15:08 - 15:12)
it's (15:11 - 15:14)
something (15:12 - 15:16)
and it's (15:14 - 15:20)
it's a nod to at least trying to let (15:16 - 15:23)
people have an ounce of flexibility like (15:20 - 15:25)
it definitely does not fix the problem (15:23 - 15:28)
that they created themselves but it does (15:25 - 15:30)
at least (15:28 - 15:34)
allow people who can't necessarily make (15:30 - 15:37)
that time have a path forward (15:34 - 15:38)
um (15:37 - 15:41)
and also it's weird because (15:38 - 15:42)
the mere fact that they do it sort of (15:41 - 15:44)
undermines the reason why the cut (15:42 - 15:46)
Community Day down to three minutes and (15:44 - 15:48)
he's like it's a whole (15:46 - 15:51)
array of mixed signals but what it does (15:48 - 15:53)
do is it gets people to the one thing I (15:51 - 15:56)
do say it does do that they wanted to do (15:53 - 15:59)
is you have to be with people in your (15:56 - 16:01)
community to make this happen (15:59 - 16:03)
so despite how it undermines pretty much (16:01 - 16:04)
every other message they said about the (16:03 - 16:07)
Community Day change it does do the one (16:04 - 16:09)
thing by saying you have to be together (16:07 - 16:12)
in the community to make this happen (16:09 - 16:12)
I really I'm excited for this like even (16:13 - 16:17)
just like from reading these event (16:16 - 16:21)
bonuses because as someone who is still (16:17 - 16:23)
trying to level like hasn't hit level (16:21 - 16:25)
cap but I'm past 40 so it's like this (16:23 - 16:27)
interminable slog (16:25 - 16:29)
um three times experience for catching (16:27 - 16:32)
Pokemon is pretty awesome especially if (16:29 - 16:34)
you're hitting Excellence (16:32 - 16:37)
um that's and especially if I like Papa (16:34 - 16:39)
lucky egg during this event like if (16:37 - 16:41)
there's a top a moment where I have a (16:39 - 16:42)
bunch of stuff that I could possibly (16:41 - 16:44)
like evolve (16:42 - 16:46)
um and be catching these things as well (16:44 - 16:48)
and getting all of that extra experience (16:46 - 16:50)
it's pretty awesome and then also since (16:48 - 16:53)
I know that my friends are also going to (16:50 - 16:54)
be playing during this time might also (16:53 - 16:58)
be popping up popping a lucky egg (16:54 - 16:59)
um there's there's like at least five (16:58 - 17:02)
different Slackers that I am really (16:59 - 17:04)
close like I'm that one day away from (17:02 - 17:06)
best friends or whatever and I'm just (17:04 - 17:08)
like every time we try and schedule it (17:06 - 17:10)
I'm like I'm not available during the (17:08 - 17:11)
entire like I'm gonna be in the field (17:10 - 17:13)
I'm not gonna have service like I can't (17:11 - 17:15)
do that (17:13 - 17:17)
um but I know that they're going to be (17:15 - 17:20)
playing and a lot of them are are (17:17 - 17:22)
luckily only an hour or two away time (17:20 - 17:25)
zone wise and so they might also be (17:22 - 17:27)
playing like during this time so (17:25 - 17:29)
um that's really cool like when it was (17:27 - 17:31)
something like Stardust I'm like thanks (17:29 - 17:33)
I don't part like personally I don't (17:31 - 17:35)
really care since I'm not (17:33 - 17:37)
like into PVP and stuff (17:35 - 17:39)
so I don't really need to like max out (17:37 - 17:42)
my Pokemon I'm here for collection and (17:39 - 17:45)
collecting and leveling and so (17:42 - 17:49)
I'm excited about that for sure (17:45 - 17:49)
uh if you're in (17:50 - 17:58)
the UK you could be uh excited that a (17:53 - 18:01)
Pokemon bus is bringing Pikachu to (17:58 - 18:04)
Manchester's tratford Center (18:01 - 18:07)
for a special treasure hunt Art Trail (18:04 - 18:08)
I didn't see really anyone talking about (18:07 - 18:09)
this (18:08 - 18:14)
well it's very highly specific to one (18:09 - 18:16)
area it's really cool though so yeah (18:14 - 18:18)
yeah I read it I was like oh this is (18:16 - 18:20)

area there are special workshops (20:10 - 20:15)

guess who want to break from art hunting (20:15 - 20:21)
can meet Pikachu at scheduled times or (20:18 - 20:23)
watch Pokemon movies and episodes of the (20:21 - 20:25)
Pokemon animated series at the main (20:23 - 20:27)
stage plus the following mysterious (20:25 - 20:30)
sightings from September 21st of Pikachu (20:27 - 20:32)
boarding a bus Pikachu will make its way (20:30 - 20:34)
to the Trafford Center on the new (20:32 - 20:37)
Pokemon bus to celebrate the opening day (20:34 - 20:38)
um so the but they're saying the bus is (20:37 - 20:42)
only going to be here on October 17th (20:38 - 20:43)
um (20:42 - 20:46)
it you know I think the reason I pulled (20:43 - 20:47)
this news even though it is to a (20:46 - 20:49)
specific area I feel like this is how (20:47 - 20:51)
you do an event (20:49 - 20:52)
yeah (20:51 - 20:54)
like you have like a treasure hunt you (20:52 - 20:57)
got like a free poster you have (20:54 - 20:58)
um (20:57 - 21:00)
you have like the meet and greet with (20:58 - 21:03)
Pikachu you have the special Workshop to (21:00 - 21:05)
dump your kids at so you can do (21:03 - 21:08)
something else you have you have the (21:05 - 21:10)
movie stuff like it seems really really (21:08 - 21:14)
cool and it kind of reminds me of (21:10 - 21:17)
when they did the mall tour for black (21:14 - 21:19)
and white where they really put a lot of (21:17 - 21:21)
effort in (21:19 - 21:22)
um (21:21 - 21:24)
and then and then like reading something (21:22 - 21:25)
like this kind of makes me like slightly (21:24 - 21:28)
jaded for like something like a safari (21:25 - 21:29)
zone (21:28 - 21:32)
or it's just like walk in a circle for (21:29 - 21:36)
six hours like yeah they had a Pikachu (21:32 - 21:37)
meet and greet and (21:36 - 21:40)
like there's no merch booth there (21:37 - 21:42)
but (21:40 - 21:45)
like why why does it seem like this (21:42 - 21:48)
little art thing has more thought and (21:45 - 21:51)
passion put behind it than like (21:48 - 21:53)
a lot of stuff recently maybe I mean (21:51 - 21:55)
maybe that's just pandemic stuff (21:53 - 21:59)
yeah no I think (21:55 - 21:59)
allows for us for to leverage like (22:00 - 22:06)
possibly like local artists like if (22:03 - 22:08)
there was something like this in my (22:06 - 22:09)
state even if it was a couple hour drive (22:08 - 22:11)
away where it's like local artists have (22:09 - 22:13)
been commissioned to do these paintings (22:11 - 22:15)
or stained glass or cave paintings or (22:13 - 22:17)
whatever throughout this mall come to (22:15 - 22:20)
this mall and spend a day and get like a (22:17 - 22:21)
certificate that said that you found (22:20 - 22:23)
them all I would do that in a heartbeat (22:21 - 22:25)
I'd make a day out of it and yeah it (22:23 - 22:26)
sounds good oh yeah I would like that (22:25 - 22:28)
would be super fun (22:26 - 22:29)
um (22:28 - 22:31)
as like a an adult that likes to go to (22:29 - 22:33)
museums (22:31 - 22:34)
um and see art like if it's something (22:33 - 22:39)
that that is Art Plus Pokemon love that (22:34 - 22:41)
um and I think it's like it's (22:39 - 22:43)
the the way that this is different is (22:41 - 22:47)
that this doesn't it's not money like (22:43 - 22:49)
this isn't they're not you don't have to (22:47 - 22:52)
spend money to do this there's no like (22:49 - 22:54)
there's nothing that they that you put (22:52 - 22:56)
money towards there's not like a booth (22:54 - 22:58)
that's like spend money here like of (22:56 - 22:59)
course you spend money in the shops (22:58 - 23:02)
right but if you're going (22:59 - 23:05)
it's it's just not a money grab in the (23:02 - 23:07)
way that like I feel like Safari zones (23:05 - 23:09)
and things of course I've not I've not (23:07 - 23:11)
been to one so I know you can speak well (23:09 - 23:14)
to that um Steve that like there's just (23:11 - 23:15)
a lot of opportunity for you to put (23:14 - 23:17)
money into tcpi (23:15 - 23:19)
um or Niantic or whatever (23:17 - 23:22)
at those other events (23:19 - 23:25)
no I mean I like I (23:22 - 23:27)
I think if if you (23:25 - 23:31)
like lived in Seoul and you liked (23:27 - 23:34)
Pokemon it was a no-brainer to go to (23:31 - 23:36)
goyang to play (23:34 - 23:39)
in the Safari Zone but because that Park (23:36 - 23:42)
was so big and because they had so much (23:39 - 23:44)
space (23:42 - 23:46)
and because you were technically there (23:44 - 23:49)
all day it just felt like (23:46 - 23:52)
why isn't there more to do mm-hmm yeah (23:49 - 23:55)
like they only had music playing in the (23:52 - 23:57)
one section so like as soon as you (23:55 - 23:59)
walked away from that it was like (23:57 - 24:01)
yeah it's the rest of the park but like (23:59 - 24:03)
it (24:01 - 24:05)
it almost felt like you were punished (24:03 - 24:07)
for walking around the lake because like (24:05 - 24:09)
everything around the lake was like (24:07 - 24:11)
there's no Pokemon themes there was like (24:09 - 24:12)
no nothing to signify that you were (24:11 - 24:15)
there and then you walked back around (24:12 - 24:16)
you're like all right I'm back where all (24:15 - 24:17)
the people are where the trading is (24:16 - 24:18)
happening where the music is playing (24:17 - 24:21)
where the Pikachus are dancing it's just (24:18 - 24:24)
like this little area felt like one (24:21 - 24:26)
tenth of the park and maybe it was like (24:24 - 24:29)
well you know we want to preserve the (24:26 - 24:30)
um you know we want you to look at this (24:29 - 24:32)
beautiful Park and it was a beautiful (24:30 - 24:34)
Park but also like (24:32 - 24:36)
once you started that Trek around that (24:34 - 24:40)
Lake you you were you committed (24:36 - 24:42)
you're on it (24:40 - 24:44)
so it kind of felt like there should (24:42 - 24:45)
have been like a kind of like a pit stop (24:44 - 24:47)
on either side or just you know (24:45 - 24:49)
something more to do (24:47 - 24:52)
um and I again it could just because B (24:49 - 24:53)
because I went to like the world (24:52 - 24:56)
championship and there was a million (24:53 - 24:58)
things to do there too (24:56 - 25:00)
um and a lot of that stuff was like free (24:58 - 25:03)
or didn't need a ticket uh (25:00 - 25:06)
so it's it's it's a little like (25:03 - 25:08)
the small tour seems like there's not (25:06 - 25:11)
tour but this mall event seems like (25:08 - 25:13)
there's so much to do (25:11 - 25:15)
for like this two-week period at the (25:13 - 25:18)
small and I mean (25:15 - 25:20)
I'm sure the mall is is very happy to (25:18 - 25:22)
host this because I'm sure it brings in (25:20 - 25:24)
a lot of money for them there there's (25:22 - 25:26)
obviously even though there's no credit (25:24 - 25:30)
or no no no money to do this somebody's (25:26 - 25:33)
making money you get you get people in (25:30 - 25:35)
those Mo that mall somebody's making (25:33 - 25:38)
money but also I'm sure you know it's (25:35 - 25:40)
good free advertising right like they (25:38 - 25:42)
have a game coming out shortly after (25:40 - 25:46)
this ends yeah I'm sure that game I (25:42 - 25:48)
wonder if that I don't know where this (25:46 - 25:51)
mall is specifically but I wonder if (25:48 - 25:53)
if this mall is the one that gets a (25:51 - 25:56)
million pre-orders for scarlet Violet (25:53 - 25:58)
because they're pushing people this way (25:56 - 26:01)
I mean it's in Manchester (25:58 - 26:01)
I don't I don't know did I go to (26:02 - 26:06)
Manchester when I was in I don't know (26:03 - 26:08)
where I went I don't think you did did (26:06 - 26:10)
you leave London (26:08 - 26:16)
ah London's big I went to the eye of the (26:10 - 26:18)
the like the ferris wheel thing is that (26:16 - 26:20)
still technically London no because (26:18 - 26:23)
Manchester is very far north of London (26:20 - 26:25)
so far what didn't you didn't go to (26:23 - 26:27)
Manchester not a suburb it's like a (26:25 - 26:30)
whole hole it's a whole nother (26:27 - 26:34)
town I will note uh here in this so in (26:30 - 26:37)
the in the article it says October 27th (26:34 - 26:39)
to 13th that's actually a typo (26:37 - 26:42)
um in the picture it says October 17th (26:39 - 26:45)
to November 13th yeah I would trust the (26:42 - 26:47)
picture and they also say that oh yeah (26:45 - 26:49)
you're talking about if the bus is there (26:47 - 26:52)
on the opening day on October 17th yeah (26:49 - 26:55)
the original is the typo so just like (26:52 - 26:58)
17th through 13th so it's not just a few (26:55 - 27:00)
weeks it's a it's almost it's almost a (26:58 - 27:02)
month yeah so but yeah it seems I I (27:00 - 27:04)
agree I get what you're saying like it (27:02 - 27:06)
seems like there's more thought and more (27:04 - 27:09)
effort put into this (27:06 - 27:12)
um type of event or like more (27:09 - 27:14)
yeah more more effort and thought put (27:12 - 27:17)
into this than a one day event where (27:14 - 27:18)
you'd think they put like all their (27:17 - 27:20)
cookies in one basket of like a bunch of (27:18 - 27:21)
people are coming here for this thing (27:20 - 27:23)
let's do a lot and then there's not even (27:21 - 27:26)
a pit stop (27:23 - 27:29)
yeah but I mean we're comparing Niantic (27:26 - 27:32)
Safari Zone to a whole Pokemon company's (27:29 - 27:36)
media event right like I highly doubt (27:32 - 27:39)
Niantic gets like a discretionary budget (27:36 - 27:41)
from the talk of my company (27:39 - 27:44)
International they have to pay out of (27:41 - 27:46)
their own (27:44 - 27:48)
budgets and they're a big company but (27:46 - 27:52)
they are they are not money deep like (27:48 - 27:53)
the Pokemon company oh yeah and couldn't (27:52 - 27:56)
even afford Evie it was it was just a (27:53 - 27:58)
Pikachu meet and greet yeah there was no (27:56 - 28:01)
Evie I want halfway around that Lake I (27:58 - 28:04)
want people dressed in water Pokemon (28:01 - 28:07)
outfits handing out water there you go I (28:04 - 28:10)
want to get a I want the squash oh my (28:07 - 28:11)
God you said that there was no water (28:10 - 28:12)
stations (28:11 - 28:15)
[Music] (28:12 - 28:15)
dressed up as water Pokemon hand me (28:18 - 28:23)
water I'm going to assume that they spit (28:21 - 28:24)
that water out of their mouth into it (28:23 - 28:26)
because that's how water Gun Works in (28:24 - 28:28)
the anime and I'd be looking at that (28:26 - 28:32)
water a second the entire type like (28:28 - 28:35)
I don't know where this came from (28:32 - 28:37)
but you need it in your body so it's (28:35 - 28:39)
okay (28:37 - 28:40)
[Music] (28:39 - 28:44)
uh VGC update here I'll squeeze in a (28:40 - 28:45)
little bit of news before we take a (28:44 - 28:47)
break because I think the next article (28:45 - 28:49)
is going to take more than 10 minutes uh (28:47 - 28:53)
series 14 is going to start on November (28:49 - 28:55)
1st uh Series 13 is running right now (28:53 - 28:58)
it's Series 13 is the same rules uh as (28:55 - 29:00)
last season which is like whatever you (28:58 - 29:04)
want you want Victini and magirna and (29:00 - 29:06)
zarude on a team I don't know why you'd (29:04 - 29:07)
probably ought to lose with those three (29:06 - 29:10)
uh but you can do that uh series 14 (29:07 - 29:13)
which will start November 1st uh we'll (29:10 - 29:15)
return to two restricted Pokemon no (29:13 - 29:17)
mythical (29:15 - 29:20)
um so if you (29:17 - 29:21)
uh (29:20 - 29:24)
remember the world championships the two (29:21 - 29:26)
restricteds that won were Shadow (29:24 - 29:28)
calorics and zashian and then the other (29:26 - 29:31)
ones that were very dominant was uh (29:28 - 29:33)
Kyogre Groudon (29:31 - 29:34)
um Palkia (29:33 - 29:37)
uh what was the other one um the the the (29:34 - 29:40)
ice rider calorex also (29:37 - 29:42)
so those those Pokemon very dominant (29:40 - 29:45)
zashian being incredibly dominant of (29:42 - 29:48)
course uh so this is like the normal you (29:45 - 29:51)
know what what World Championships rules (29:48 - 29:53)
were it's returning to that on November (29:51 - 29:54)
1st (29:53 - 29:57)
so you can enjoy that for the 18 days (29:54 - 30:00)
before scarlet and violet if you were (29:57 - 30:02)
sick of the mythical format which it (30:00 - 30:03)
didn't sound like a lot of people were (30:02 - 30:07)
thrilled with the mythical format I (30:03 - 30:09)
remember asking that uh uh uh my friend (30:07 - 30:11)
Joe he's like a really he's like a top (30:09 - 30:16)
player qualified for Worlds made made it (30:11 - 30:17)
to day two of Worlds which is incredibly (30:16 - 30:19)
impressive and I remember being like hey (30:17 - 30:23)
I really want to try Series 13 or 12 or (30:19 - 30:24)
whatever it was with the mythical (30:23 - 30:25)
Pokemon (30:24 - 30:27)
I was like can you send me like two (30:25 - 30:29)
rental teams and he sent me two teams (30:27 - 30:31)
and neither of the teams had mythical (30:29 - 30:34)
Pokemon on it and I was like oh I meant (30:31 - 30:36)
like the the new like the new mythical (30:34 - 30:39)
format I was like I wanted to try that (30:36 - 30:40)
and he was like these are the best teams (30:39 - 30:44)
in this current format and I was like oh (30:40 - 30:46)
oh (30:44 - 30:46)
I was like uh okay that makes sense like (30:47 - 30:52)
yeah uh all the mythicals are bad I (30:49 - 30:57)
understand did it have a warzard though (30:52 - 30:57)
[Laughter] (31:00 - 31:04)
did you see (31:02 - 31:06)
that picture I did I did see that it was (31:04 - 31:10)
very good oh my gosh boo okay uh let's (31:06 - 31:13)

and we are back from our break (31:24 - 31:33)
so I don't know if y'all remember (31:28 - 31:36)
uh but there was a really weird Pokemon (31:33 - 31:41)
Go slash long long Chomp Longchamp yeah (31:36 - 31:43)
I don't know yep Tie in (31:41 - 31:45)
uh that they did for the very I think it (31:43 - 31:47)
was when they first introduced fur (31:45 - 31:48)
fruits like the original Fashion Week (31:47 - 31:52)
yeah yeah a few years ago and these (31:48 - 31:55)
Longchamp sorry I know it's French I'm (31:52 - 31:57)
probably saying it wrong (31:55 - 32:00)
these purses these bags were like eight (31:57 - 32:02)
hundred dollars (32:00 - 32:04)
and they were like black and white and (32:02 - 32:06)
they had like Pikachu on them they look (32:04 - 32:08)
really great yeah I'm not in the market (32:06 - 32:10)
for a purse but I'm sure at least half (32:08 - 32:12)
of our listeners are in the market for a (32:10 - 32:14)
purse uh (32:12 - 32:16)
prices are for everybody (32:14 - 32:19)
sure yeah yeah I I I have just enough (32:16 - 32:21)
bags in my life that I don't need an 800 (32:19 - 32:26)
you are longchampers you are a sling (32:21 - 32:28)
Laker I do like the slings yes slings (32:26 - 32:30)
are in right now (32:28 - 32:32)
it's like saying fanny packs are in (32:30 - 32:34)
right now they were never and they never (32:32 - 32:36)
will be in people just wear them and try (32:34 - 32:37)
to tell everybody these they're in right (32:36 - 32:39)
now they're not (32:37 - 32:42)
slings are in right now so anyways there (32:39 - 32:43)
was there was that collaboration there's (32:42 - 32:46)
been a ton of collaborations since right (32:43 - 32:49)
there there was the the the BBC not to (32:46 - 32:51)
be confused with the news Billionaire (32:49 - 32:53)
Boys Club billionaires boy club they did (32:51 - 32:55)
actually send me a shirt they sent me (32:53 - 32:59)
that 50 Mewtwo shirt what they did I I (32:55 - 33:00)
haven't even opened it yet but I was (32:59 - 33:02)
like oh this is this I I feel weird (33:00 - 33:04)
wearing a 50 (33:02 - 33:08)
like it's you frame it or something (33:04 - 33:08)
yeah well FYI podcast listeners do not (33:21 - 33:29)
ever go to see profession advice (33:26 - 33:31)
so that that hoodie is pretty awesome (33:29 - 33:32)
that you're wearing right now that's (33:31 - 33:34)
true I got the body on (33:32 - 33:35)
um so (33:34 - 33:37)
there has been a lot of collaboration (33:35 - 33:41)
since this is off fashionunited.com (33:37 - 33:43)
okay before we get too far into it I (33:41 - 33:45)
wanted to State what my absolute (33:43 - 33:47)
favorite part of this and it's right at (33:45 - 33:49)
the top (33:47 - 33:51)
can you guess (33:49 - 33:51)
right at the top yeah the it says buy (33:52 - 33:59)
sponsor it says advertorial by sponsor (33:55 - 34:01)
so it's admitting it's an editorial and (33:59 - 34:05)
an advertisement right there by unknown (34:01 - 34:09)
sponsor this is the greatest article (34:05 - 34:11)
writer and title I've ever read in my (34:09 - 34:12)
life you know I've never heard of (34:11 - 34:14)
fashionunited.com but I'm sure they have (34:12 - 34:16)
their finger on the pulse they do (34:14 - 34:19)
especially since this is August 24th and (34:16 - 34:21)
we're just getting to it now (34:19 - 34:24)
yeah again like I feel I felt like I (34:21 - 34:26)
pulled a lot of articles that like no (34:24 - 34:27)
one actually talked about because it (34:26 - 34:30)
wasn't about tree texture in a video (34:27 - 34:32)
game like (34:30 - 34:32)
sometimes sometimes the the Pokemon (34:33 - 34:37)
Community hyper focuses on some really (34:35 - 34:39)
specific stuff and ignores everything (34:37 - 34:41)
else I think this stuff is interesting (34:39 - 34:43)
though it's titled how Pokemon forge's (34:41 - 34:47)
successful licensing Partnerships (34:43 - 34:48)
um from the trading card games and the (34:47 - 34:50)
video games to Fashion collaborations (34:48 - 34:52)
the Pokemon Universe is continuing to (34:50 - 34:54)
evolve and instantly recognizable (34:52 - 34:55)
characters such as Pikachu and (34:54 - 34:58)
Jigglypuff uh have made it one of the (34:55 - 35:00)
most powerful brands in the world of (34:58 - 35:02)
Licensing (35:00 - 35:05)
I'm going to pause here and as as we (35:02 - 35:06)
talked about before (35:05 - 35:09)
uh Pokemon does not make its money from (35:06 - 35:11)
video games it does it does make some it (35:09 - 35:14)
makes sense like it's not like it's a (35:11 - 35:17)
net loss I believe it's close to about (35:14 - 35:19)
65 of all its money comes from (35:17 - 35:22)
merchandise and about 20 of its money (35:19 - 35:26)
comes from video games then like 10 is (35:22 - 35:27)
like TCG stuff (35:26 - 35:29)
and the rest is like movies and Anime (35:27 - 35:31)
and all that stuff (35:29 - 35:33)
as a leading Global entertainment brand (35:31 - 35:36)
Pokemon has a remarkably diverse I've (35:33 - 35:38)
said that weird fan base spanning (35:36 - 35:40)
several Generations from kids to adults (35:38 - 35:42)
of all ages to expand its reach and (35:40 - 35:44)
engage with all its fans the franchise (35:42 - 35:46)
has grown with licensing and (35:44 - 35:48)
collaborations to create new encounters (35:46 - 35:51)
with Pokemon in 2021 the Pokemon company (35:48 - 35:54)
celebrated its 25th anniversary and (35:51 - 35:55)
marked one of its most success (35:54 - 35:58)
successful years to date ranking fifth (35:55 - 36:02)
in the top 150 Global licensors report (35:58 - 36:04)
showcasing the most powerful brand (36:02 - 36:06)
licensing programs at retail from 2021 (36:04 - 36:11)
with a sale of 8.5 billion US Dollars up (36:06 - 36:14)
from 5.1 billion dollars that it did in (36:11 - 36:16)
2020. (36:14 - 36:20)
so yeah in uh in one year (36:16 - 36:23)
it was able to make an extra 3.4 billion (36:20 - 36:26)
dollars just by and all that went to a (36:23 - 36:30)
mall tour in Manchester but all of it (36:26 - 36:32)
give it three billion dollars to (36:30 - 36:34)
Manchester (36:32 - 36:37)
uh this Success is Not only due to the (36:34 - 36:39)
colorful and playful uhness of Pokemon (36:37 - 36:41)
characters that continue to offer (36:39 - 36:43)
inspiration but also the diversity of (36:41 - 36:46)
collaborations uh entering the ma in the (36:43 - 36:49)
metaverse with uh Charlie Cohen to (36:46 - 36:53)
design collections with Jeremy Scott and (36:49 - 36:56)
gdgcds uh as well as affordable line (36:53 - 36:59)

like they really call you out there like (37:38 - 37:42)
if you know the first three you're like (37:39 - 37:44)
a luxury and then like the other three (37:42 - 37:46)

Pokemon is not just for kids there is (38:54 - 38:59)

fashion collaborations spanning apparel (39:01 - 39:05)
Footwear accessories for both adults and (39:03 - 39:07)
kids is this like the first time an (39:05 - 39:08)
official Pokemon (39:07 - 39:11)
employee has like said in a like a press (39:08 - 39:13)
release that Pokemon is not just for (39:11 - 39:17)
kids I have not heard that in like (39:13 - 39:18)
anywhere else like this is the first (39:17 - 39:21)
time I'm hearing of it and I was like (39:18 - 39:23)
people on the video saw that I plotted (39:21 - 39:25)
yeah I don't know that they've (39:23 - 39:26)
officially stated that I think they've (39:25 - 39:30)
called it for everyone before yeah (39:26 - 39:35)
specifically said not just for kids I (39:30 - 39:35)
have seen in the last few years like has (39:36 - 39:39)
definitely shown that it's not just for (39:38 - 39:42)
kids like the the some of the shirts (39:39 - 39:45)
that um that I know that you've you've (39:42 - 39:47)
worn Steve like the like business attire (39:45 - 39:48)
or short shirts (39:47 - 39:52)
for children and so like yeah the 100 (39:48 - 39:54)
the 100 original Stitch so they're not (39:52 - 39:56)
selling that to like six-year-olds (39:54 - 39:59)
six-year-olds don't they're no the (39:56 - 40:00)
six-year-olds want the three hundred (39:59 - 40:04)
dollar Charlie Cohen designer collection (40:00 - 40:06)
um yeah no I think but this is the first (40:04 - 40:09)
time it's very explicitly stated that (40:06 - 40:11)
I've heard yeah I mean it's it's always (40:09 - 40:13)
a frustrated conversation of like you (40:11 - 40:17)
know you as us as adults making a (40:13 - 40:19)
Pokemon podcast and then you know we (40:17 - 40:22)
have a valid criticism of the games or (40:19 - 40:23)
the series or the franchise and then (40:22 - 40:25)
somebody's like why do you care so much (40:23 - 40:29)
it's just a kid's thing which is like (40:25 - 40:29)
it almost reminds me of like the mindset (40:29 - 40:34)
of like my parents being like when are (40:32 - 40:36)
you going to stop playing video games (40:34 - 40:38)
like when are you gonna grow up and like (40:36 - 40:41)
leave that like it's almost like a hyper (40:38 - 40:44)
focus on a single game and like it feels (40:41 - 40:45)
like that's what they're doing with (40:44 - 40:46)
Pokemon it's like when are you going to (40:45 - 40:48)
grow up and stop playing it's like when (40:46 - 40:49)
you're going to grow up and stop (40:48 - 40:52)
watching watching sports sports I would (40:49 - 40:54)
say that to people I'm like you know (40:52 - 40:55)
when are you gonna stop watching (40:54 - 40:57)
football because kids play football yeah (40:55 - 41:00)
yeah it's just something past that kid (40:57 - 41:00)
game (41:00 - 41:03)
and you just don't get that with other (41:00 - 41:05)
Nintendo branded like you don't get that (41:03 - 41:07)
with Mario or Zelda like I've never (41:05 - 41:09)
heard somebody be like Zelda's a kid's (41:07 - 41:13)
game but it's I mean I I have but I'm (41:09 - 41:17)
also older so it's like like Nintendo is (41:13 - 41:21)
really good and I would like I think it (41:17 - 41:24)
also speaks to the fact that Pokemon is (41:21 - 41:26)
incredibly incredibly incredibly (41:24 - 41:27)
recognizable (41:26 - 41:31)
Lord like more than like people know of (41:27 - 41:33)
Mario but they're not like like there (41:31 - 41:37)
aren't a ton of Mario action figures or (41:33 - 41:39)
card games in the toy section at a (41:37 - 41:43)
Target sometimes there is but but not (41:39 - 41:47)
as many things like it's it's it's part (41:43 - 41:50)
of their success that they are (41:47 - 41:52)
very well branded and and part of that (41:50 - 41:56)
is adults like oh I saw that as a kid (41:52 - 41:57)
um (41:56 - 41:59)
and so they just connect those two and (41:57 - 42:03)
it's a lot of lazy thinking yeah (41:59 - 42:05)
yeah but what I was gonna say is like (42:03 - 42:09)
like I Nintendo has been very good a lot (42:05 - 42:10)
of game companies have been very good at (42:09 - 42:13)
making their games appeal to all ages (42:10 - 42:16)
and if you look at like very successful (42:13 - 42:17)
games (42:16 - 42:21)
like fortnite or Minecraft (42:17 - 42:24)
like I felt like those games and I don't (42:21 - 42:26)
have this I'm I'm sure I'm sure those (42:24 - 42:28)
companies know I felt like those games (42:26 - 42:30)
first appealed to (42:28 - 42:32)
people my age (42:30 - 42:35)
and then it dripped down into kids and (42:32 - 42:37)
I've and at least from what I've heard (42:35 - 42:39)
of teachers because I've talked to a (42:37 - 42:41)
bunch of teachers that have come through (42:39 - 42:42)
my stream or like in person they're like (42:41 - 42:44)
yep kids just like it it would be (42:42 - 42:46)
shocking if I didn't see like seven kids (42:44 - 42:48)
with a fortnight shirt on yeah (42:46 - 42:51)
and it's like fortnite to me I they (42:48 - 42:53)
didn't like design it for like eight (42:51 - 42:54)
year olds I'm sure eight year olds love (42:53 - 42:57)
fortnite very like and that's cool (42:54 - 42:59)
but like (42:57 - 43:02)
they were successful because they made a (42:59 - 43:04)
game that just happened to appeal to (43:02 - 43:07)
everyone and there are plenty of adults (43:04 - 43:09)
there are plenty of teenagers there are (43:07 - 43:11)
plenty of kids I am sure Grandpa and (43:09 - 43:12)
Grandma somewhere are playing fortnite (43:11 - 43:16)
and watching you know uh Travis Scott (43:12 - 43:18)
perform in fortnite with his concert (43:16 - 43:19)
like I'm sure that is happening (43:18 - 43:21)
somewhere out there (43:19 - 43:23)
well I mean also like another another (43:21 - 43:26)
parallel to draw here is like (43:23 - 43:29)
Marvel like yeah and things like like I (43:26 - 43:31)
know that people for a long time and (43:29 - 43:33)
again this is not true (43:31 - 43:35)
um that oh comic books are for kids and (43:33 - 43:37)
like blah blah blah and like that's not (43:35 - 43:38)
true (43:37 - 43:40)
um and now you can see that very clearly (43:38 - 43:43)
in that the Marvel movies are this huge (43:40 - 43:45)
industry and you see people (43:43 - 43:48)
constantly dressing up as them for you (43:45 - 43:52)
know cosplay or Halloween or it's it's (43:48 - 43:54)
so commonplace to see someone wearing a (43:52 - 43:56)
shirt that has some type of tie to (43:54 - 43:58)
Marvel versus if I were to wear like a (43:56 - 44:00)
Pokemon shirt or something like that (43:58 - 44:03)
it's I could get those comments of like (44:00 - 44:06)
wow you still play Pokemon and I'm like (44:03 - 44:08)
yeah why is that why is that different (44:06 - 44:11)
like why is this the different thing and (44:08 - 44:14)
I I don't understand it either did I (44:11 - 44:15)
ever tell you that people at work try to (44:14 - 44:18)
tried and very unsuccessfully tried they (44:15 - 44:21)
did not see it shaming me about Pokemon (44:18 - 44:23)
they tried for like two minutes and I (44:21 - 44:25)
read them the riot act I'm like no we're (44:23 - 44:28)
not we're not playing this game yeah (44:25 - 44:31)
uh it says here in the article we strive (44:28 - 44:34)
to create an exceptional and uh we tried (44:31 - 44:36)
to create exceptional collaborations (44:34 - 44:39)
with must have appeal a truly impactful (44:36 - 44:41)
collaboration stands out for being (44:39 - 44:43)
Innovative original and creative while (44:41 - 44:45)
also sticking out in the minds of our (44:43 - 44:47)
fans a good collaboration needs to be (44:45 - 44:49)
authentic to Pokemon's values and truly (44:47 - 44:51)
understand our amazing audience we are (44:49 - 44:53)
very protective of our brand and we do (44:51 - 44:55)
everything possible to ensure that our (44:53 - 44:56)
products connect and resonate with our (44:55 - 44:58)
fans that can be seen through our (44:56 - 44:59)
consistent and strong retail sales (44:58 - 45:02)
across various Partnerships (44:59 - 45:05)
uh our brand ethos is to surprise and (45:02 - 45:06)
Delight our fans with collaborations (45:05 - 45:08)
just look at Longchamp and Clarks for (45:06 - 45:10)
example these are Brands you wouldn't (45:08 - 45:12)
immediately associate with Pokemon (45:10 - 45:15)
that's true that's very those those are (45:12 - 45:18)
very those are two very good examples (45:15 - 45:18)
our Longchamp and Pokemon collaboration (45:18 - 45:23)
was a huge success in 2020 as it (45:20 - 45:25)
playfully brought two iconic Brands (45:23 - 45:27)
together blending French Elegance with (45:25 - 45:30)
Japanese Kawaii the did I say that right (45:27 - 45:33)
yeah the fashion accessory collection (45:30 - 45:35)
saw Pikachu adorning 27 products from (45:33 - 45:38)
luggage to tote bags to phone cases (45:35 - 45:41)
scarves and key Rings we also dressed up (45:38 - 45:43)
Pikachu in a jockey helmet to pay homage (45:41 - 45:48)
to longchamps logo uh it was also fun to (45:43 - 45:50)
promote this collection as 250 Longchamp (45:48 - 45:52)
stores worldwide held Pokemon branding (45:50 - 45:54)
and held pop-up events uh the Highlight (45:52 - 45:56)
was our in their special in-game Pokemon (45:54 - 45:59)
go event during passion Paris fashion (45:56 - 46:02)
week uh the activity achieved Global (45:59 - 46:04)
press and social media coverage and was (46:02 - 46:06)
hugely successful in terms of turnover (46:04 - 46:09)
and media value (46:06 - 46:11)
so I I think this is my favorite like (46:09 - 46:13)
two paragraphs of the entire article (46:11 - 46:15)
because we literally sat here on a 30 (46:13 - 46:18)
minute episode being like (46:15 - 46:22)
who's buying an 800 purse like who who (46:18 - 46:24)
was buying an 800 Pikachu purse (46:22 - 46:29)
and it's it's it's so great to hear now (46:24 - 46:31)
you know two years later that the (46:29 - 46:34)
Pokemon company talking about this and (46:31 - 46:37)
being like this specific (46:34 - 46:39)
like Not only was this crazy that like (46:37 - 46:41)
these two bro and they say it here like (46:39 - 46:43)
it was I don't make sense (46:41 - 46:45)
for long Champion Pokemon to be there (46:43 - 46:49)
but them to say it was hugely successful (46:45 - 46:54)
um and they and it wasn't you know (46:49 - 46:56)
I think sometimes you can separate like (46:54 - 46:58)
hey we didn't make a lot of money from (46:56 - 47:01)
this but you they say hugely successful (46:58 - 47:02)
in terms of turnover and media value (47:01 - 47:05)
they're correct like we talked about it (47:02 - 47:07)
a ton of other people talked about it of (47:05 - 47:08)
like (47:07 - 47:10)
hey Pokemon is partnering with like (47:08 - 47:13)
they're making an 800 purse and it was (47:10 - 47:15)
just wild to think about how much media (47:13 - 47:16)
coverage that gotten and people talking (47:15 - 47:19)
about it and then it was like I remember (47:16 - 47:21)
seeing one of those purses for the first (47:19 - 47:23)
time in the wild and I was like (47:21 - 47:25)
I know how much you spent on that and (47:23 - 47:27)
that's insane but that's also really (47:25 - 47:29)
cool that you have that like very very (47:27 - 47:32)
specific purse from this very specific (47:29 - 47:33)
event (47:32 - 47:34)
um (47:33 - 47:36)
we just launched an exciting (47:34 - 47:38)
collaboration with Clarks which brings (47:36 - 47:40)
the uh which brings to life our much (47:38 - 47:42)
loved Pokemon characters Pikachu (47:40 - 47:43)
Squirtle Mewtwo and our famous Pokeball (47:42 - 47:46)
symbol on some super cool Footwear the (47:43 - 47:49)
10 piece collection features classic (47:46 - 47:51)
Clark's kid and legendary Clark's (47:49 - 47:54)
original sneakers and shoes and include (47:51 - 47:57)
a cute mini me moment the kids black (47:54 - 48:00)
suede oh okay whatever now they're just (47:57 - 48:01)
advertising the shoes (48:00 - 48:02)
um (48:01 - 48:04)
uh we know how many of our fans use (48:02 - 48:06)
fashion and wear Pokemon clothes to (48:04 - 48:08)
express their love of our intellectual (48:06 - 48:10)
property that makes fashion a shared (48:08 - 48:12)
language and we choose to work with (48:10 - 48:14)
Brands who speak our language for us (48:12 - 48:16)
that means Brands offer quality creative (48:14 - 48:18)
fun wearability sustainability (48:16 - 48:21)
Innovation and Boundary pushing ideals (48:18 - 48:22)
having a great collection is not enough (48:21 - 48:25)
we also find new ways uh to shout about (48:22 - 48:27)
it meaning that (48:25 - 48:29)
the standout Market supports at retail (48:27 - 48:32)
and Beyond is more important is just as (48:29 - 48:34)
important too we love creating hype and (48:32 - 48:36)
we need our collaborations to tell a (48:34 - 48:37)
story that will speak to our fans and (48:36 - 48:40)
keep them engaged and enthused (48:37 - 48:43)
fashionunited.com team yell confirmed (48:40 - 48:45)
yeah I am not gonna lie I want those (48:43 - 48:48)
clerks the problem problem is and I'm (48:45 - 48:50)
I'm looking it up the problem is that (48:48 - 48:53)
they only have two colors like two (48:50 - 48:56)
Styles in the adults section yeah I know (48:53 - 48:58)
you but like they show these (48:56 - 49:01)
what there's a Clarks at Mall of America (48:58 - 49:05)
oh but they I mean like this Mewtwo one (49:01 - 49:07)
that they show in the in the article (49:05 - 49:08)
looks really cool like it's this kind of (49:07 - 49:10)
lighter pink color like it's Mewtwo's (49:08 - 49:11)
colors it has Mewtwo on the back and (49:10 - 49:13)
then it's got a Pokeball on the bottom (49:11 - 49:14)
this looks really cool but it's one of (49:13 - 49:17)
the kids ones yeah so you only have two (49:14 - 49:20)
options like they have the kids sneakers (49:17 - 49:21)
yeah (49:20 - 49:24)
it's all right final paragraph here is (49:21 - 49:25)
take the converse and Pokemon (49:24 - 49:27)
collaboration for our 25th anniversary (49:25 - 49:29)
the Footwear apparel and accessory (49:27 - 49:32)
collection sold out online within 48 (49:29 - 49:34)
hours due to the huge demand of our (49:32 - 49:36)
customers customized print on demand (49:34 - 49:38)
shoes we had to turn off this activity (49:36 - 49:41)
for two weeks we had to turn off this (49:38 - 49:43)
activities two weeks early as demand (49:41 - 49:46)
exceeded Supply while as our long (49:43 - 49:48)
Champion Pokemon collection was (49:46 - 49:50)
nominated for best collaboration at a (49:48 - 49:54)
licensing International award (49:50 - 49:56)
so what I find interesting and what (49:54 - 49:57)
they're not what they're not really (49:56 - 50:01)
saying is that (49:57 - 50:05)
what's good for their brand is that the (50:01 - 50:07)
adults (50:05 - 50:11)
who played this as a kid are still (50:07 - 50:13)
attached to the brand now that they have (50:11 - 50:14)
money (50:13 - 50:17)
so it's a sign of like how the how (50:14 - 50:19)
Disney does generational things like (50:17 - 50:22)
every 10 years they'll re-release a (50:19 - 50:23)
bunch of films because they're getting a (50:22 - 50:26)
new generation of kids what we're seeing (50:23 - 50:28)
here is at the 25th anniversary was a (50:26 - 50:30)
Mark that made so much money because (50:28 - 50:32)
they have successfully kept Their (50:30 - 50:35)
audience which is really good for the (50:32 - 50:36)
future (50:35 - 50:39)
length and life of their brand because (50:36 - 50:42)
now they can do adult collaborations (50:39 - 50:45)
and those are successful so they've (50:42 - 50:48)
successfully kept an audience now for 25 (50:45 - 50:50)
years which is how they've become such a (50:48 - 50:53)
national and huge brand presence and (50:50 - 50:55)
that's like the sort of unstated thing (50:53 - 50:58)
of this article is yeah we have done it (50:55 - 51:02)
we have we have hit the Disney Mark of (50:58 - 51:06)
this is now part of everybody's lexicon (51:02 - 51:08)
and (51:06 - 51:10)
it is now going to be a generational (51:08 - 51:12)
thing like we've proved now that we've (51:10 - 51:14)
passed one generation into the next that (51:12 - 51:17)
this is a generational product (51:14 - 51:20)
side note I wonder if Clark's sponsored (51:17 - 51:21)
this article since they really like (51:20 - 51:23)
spent like two paragraphs talking about (51:21 - 51:25)
their specific shoes I'm not gonna lie I (51:23 - 51:27)
want the Pikachu yellow boot hardcore I (51:25 - 51:30)
don't want to spend 180 dollars but I do (51:27 - 51:31)
want it (51:30 - 51:33)
yeah and I think that's a thing that I I (51:31 - 51:37)
feel like people Overlook uh although (51:33 - 51:39)
although our our podcast talks about (51:37 - 51:40)
like the the Pokemon news of like hey (51:39 - 51:42)
they're collaborating with BBC hey (51:40 - 51:43)
they're collaborating with Oreos hey (51:42 - 51:46)
they're collaborating with fossil (51:43 - 51:47)
um like we talk about that stuff very (51:46 - 51:50)
casually because like we talk about (51:47 - 51:54)
Pokemon every single week but (51:50 - 51:54)
but like that's really impactful to like (51:54 - 52:00)
keep hitting those (51:58 - 52:03)
um keep hitting like an audience that (52:00 - 52:05)
doesn't look at Pokemon on a weekly (52:03 - 52:07)
basis like somebody walking into a store (52:05 - 52:09)
being like oh they put Pikachu on Oreos (52:07 - 52:11)
let's get the Pikachu Oreos this week (52:09 - 52:12)
because like (52:11 - 52:15)
we got they're the same price but this (52:12 - 52:18)
one has Pikachu on it or or the you know (52:15 - 52:21)
walking into a Levi's and seeing you (52:18 - 52:23)
know a Pikachu jacket and being like Oh (52:21 - 52:25)
I came here for jeans but look at this (52:23 - 52:27)
cool Pikachu jacket like they they've (52:25 - 52:29)
done such a good job in the last couple (52:27 - 52:34)
years of just working with brands (52:29 - 52:35)
um and like hitting these huge media (52:34 - 52:38)
things where it's like we're we're with (52:35 - 52:39)
Levi's we're with Converse we're with (52:38 - 52:41)
Oreo we're with Nabisco we're with (52:39 - 52:43)
Clarks we're with Longchamp we're with (52:41 - 52:47)
uh BBC I still think BBC is a very bad (52:43 - 52:49)
name for a billion Billionaire Boys Club (52:47 - 52:52)
yeah (52:49 - 52:52)
I mean adults have money (52:56 - 53:00)
I was gonna like the one thing that I (52:58 - 53:02)
would introject here that like is on my (53:00 - 53:04)
mind every time they every time you talk (53:02 - 53:06)
about these types of collaborations and (53:04 - 53:08)
Partnerships is like what what what what (53:06 - 53:11)
are you what would you like like what (53:08 - 53:13)
would you want that hasn't been done (53:11 - 53:16)
before (53:13 - 53:16)
that's a good question (53:18 - 53:24)
it can be added maybe to next week's (53:21 - 53:25)
question of the week but it's just like (53:24 - 53:27)
that's something to me that I'm always (53:25 - 53:29)
like I I'm like oh this is such a good (53:27 - 53:31)
idea and this is so cool but then I'm (53:29 - 53:32)
like (53:31 - 53:34)
this is this is probably really specific (53:32 - 53:38)
but uh Disney partnered with Apple for (53:34 - 53:40)
like those uh like two Mickey Mouse (53:38 - 53:42)
watch faces that are exclusive to the (53:40 - 53:43)
Apple watch (53:42 - 53:45)
uh and I feel like Pokemon is on that (53:43 - 53:48)
level to be like oh there's a here's a (53:45 - 53:51)
Pikachu exclusive Apple watch face (53:48 - 53:53)
and here's like a Charmander like it (53:51 - 53:55)
would probably be Charizard right (53:53 - 53:57)
let's be real (53:55 - 53:59)
um but but like Disney Disney is on that (53:57 - 54:01)
level and I'm sure (53:59 - 54:03)
I am sure there are people that had zero (54:01 - 54:06)
interest in an Apple Watch and they were (54:03 - 54:08)
big big Disney adults (54:06 - 54:10)
and they pulled the trigger on Apple (54:08 - 54:12)
watch because they could have a Mickey (54:10 - 54:14)
Mouse watch face I'm sure those people (54:12 - 54:16)
exist oh I can see them doing it for (54:14 - 54:18)
watch bands as well like if I could have (54:16 - 54:20)
a watch band that (54:18 - 54:23)
had something like something Pokemon (54:20 - 54:25)
related on it that would be really cute (54:23 - 54:27)
because right now I don't have Apple (54:25 - 54:29)
watch but like I could get one I have (54:27 - 54:31)
one I know someone that's trying to get (54:29 - 54:33)
rid of one so I can get it (54:31 - 54:34)
um (54:33 - 54:37)
access to one but I currently am like (54:34 - 54:39)
meh but like (54:37 - 54:42)
if I could get like a Vulpix (54:39 - 54:45)
little cute little sleepy Vulpix on it (54:42 - 54:48)
or something I would I don't know it's (54:45 - 54:51)
done anything with Nike yet they did (54:48 - 54:54)
something I don't think it is I could (54:51 - 54:56)
see Vans I could see them doing (54:54 - 54:58)
something cool oh yeah (54:56 - 55:01)
because I know Vans does a lot of (54:58 - 55:03)
um cool collaborations and I'm still (55:01 - 55:05)
searching forever they have this 1B (55:03 - 55:08)
design that I wanted so bad and I can't (55:05 - 55:10)
find it anywhere and I'm still forever I (55:08 - 55:12)
go into a Vance there was a Sailor Moon (55:10 - 55:14)
Vans collaboration like two months ago (55:12 - 55:17)
yeah I would I would buy a Doc Martens (55:14 - 55:21)
Pokemon collab in a minute (55:17 - 55:24)
now though (55:21 - 55:26)
what I thought they like outsourced like (55:24 - 55:28)
the they they like don't use the same (55:26 - 55:30)
Factory anymore and they use cheaper (55:28 - 55:32)
materials that's just what I read I (55:30 - 55:34)
wasn't sure I hadn't heard that (55:32 - 55:36)
I want pieces out of the equipment that (55:34 - 55:38)
is Pokemon (55:36 - 55:39)
hmm (55:38 - 55:42)
okay anyway that was just an aside yeah (55:39 - 55:45)
I'm trying to think of what I would (55:42 - 55:48)

um final article here is off BBC not to (56:09 - 56:15)
be confused the Billionaire Boys Club (56:12 - 56:18)
this is the British wait what does BBC (56:15 - 56:20)
stand for Broadcasting Corporation (56:18 - 56:22)
British Broadcasting corporate I'm (56:20 - 56:26)
assuming do you know what it actually is (56:22 - 56:29)
Greg we've broken Greg is that not what (56:26 - 56:31)

Broadcasting Corporation but okay good (56:37 - 56:41)
that whole thing leading up to it just (56:39 - 56:44)
killed me so okay go go go (56:41 - 56:48)
world's largest Pokemon collection could (56:44 - 56:52)
sell for 300 000 pounds I think that's (56:48 - 56:56)
the L with the line is pounds right yeah (56:52 - 56:58)
the world's largest collection of (56:56 - 57:00)
Pokemon memorabilia assembled by a super (56:58 - 57:02)
fan of over 25 years is to go under the (57:00 - 57:05)
hammer is that an expression (57:02 - 57:08)
yeah oh like like auction doesn't have (57:05 - 57:10)
like an oxygen Hammer I was thinking of (57:08 - 57:13)
like Tim the toolman hammer I (57:10 - 57:13)
mean (57:15 - 57:20)
tend to call it a gavel here and not a (57:17 - 57:23)
hammer that's true so so there are more (57:20 - 57:27)
than 200 000 items to be auctioned 20. (57:23 - 57:30)
oh sorry twenty thousand uh the hall (57:27 - 57:33)
will be sold officially on October 18th (57:30 - 57:36)
I guess that's the end date (57:33 - 57:37)
um (57:36 - 57:39)
the auction firm believes that it should (57:37 - 57:43)
make up to 300 000 pounds The Collection (57:39 - 57:44)
consists of trading cards video games (57:43 - 57:47)
manga film posters toys action figures (57:44 - 57:51)
books toilet paper items from the UK US (57:47 - 57:54)
France and Japan after two decades of (57:51 - 57:57)
collect of catching them all the seller (57:54 - 57:59)
said she had decided to sell her hall (57:57 - 58:02)
for financial reasons although we'll be (57:59 - 58:04)
keeping a few sentimental items the (58:02 - 58:06)
Guinness the Guinness World Record (58:04 - 58:08)
certificate which has been displayed in (58:06 - 58:10)
hartford's museum (58:08 - 58:15)
hartford's museum as part of an uh (58:10 - 58:15)
exhibition yeah part of an exhibition of (58:16 - 58:21)
unpopular culture yes I don't know why I (58:19 - 58:23)
struggled with that word so much will be (58:21 - 58:27)
kept as an important keepsake (58:23 - 58:29)
uh this is a fantastic once in a (58:27 - 58:31)
lifetime opportunity to own a single (58:29 - 58:32)
largest collection of Pokemon (58:31 - 58:34)
memorabilia that has ever come to the (58:32 - 58:36)
market and it is currently being stored (58:34 - 58:38)
in a secure lockup (58:36 - 58:41)
uh Pokemon is has been soaring in value (58:38 - 58:43)
in collection the collector's market for (58:41 - 58:46)
the past six years wealthy young people (58:43 - 58:47)
in their 20s and 30s who got into (58:46 - 58:49)
Pokemon when they were children have (58:47 - 58:52)
been buying uh are buying and prices (58:49 - 58:54)
have spiked (58:52 - 58:55)
um and there's no conclusion to this (58:54 - 58:58)
article because it's not October 18th so (58:55 - 59:00)
we don't (58:58 - 59:02)
actually no I don't know what it's (59:00 - 59:03)
actually going to sell for there's also (59:02 - 59:05)
not a list of things (59:03 - 59:07)
in here like we don't (59:05 - 59:09)
like they say that it's like cards and (59:07 - 59:12)
video games and my like all I know is in (59:09 - 59:14)
the picture there's a rosary then the (59:12 - 59:15)
Rosalia action figure and I'm like I (59:14 - 59:17)
just want can I just buy those two (59:15 - 59:21)
pieces no single can I just single haul (59:17 - 59:23)
I know you know what's funny is like the (59:21 - 59:25)
video game stuff isn't in the the most (59:23 - 59:27)
expensive stuff right like you could be (59:25 - 59:28)
like well hard gold soul silver is like (59:27 - 59:30)
a hundred dollars and it's like a (59:28 - 59:32)
hundred dollars is nothing if it's (59:30 - 59:33)
supposed to be auctioned at three (59:32 - 59:36)
hundred thousand like the video games (59:33 - 59:38)
because they're they're easily found I (59:36 - 59:39)
there's got to be stuff in here there's (59:38 - 59:43)
got to be cards and plushes and yeah odd (59:39 - 59:45)
memorabilia that like what were made (59:43 - 59:48)
once and never seen again toilet paper (59:45 - 59:50)
man yeah oh she's not selling ancient (59:48 - 59:53)
Mew because that that is yeah I mean it (59:50 - 59:55)
could be that she just has 300 ancient (59:53 - 59:57)
Muse (59:55 - 59:59)
she just saw the movie so many times (59:57 - 60:02)
yeah she just really liked it (59:59 - 60:06)
for non-uk listeners who might be uh (60:02 - 60:10)
ignorant of how many how much 300 pounds (60:06 - 60:12)
is um not me I know exactly what it is (60:10 - 60:16)
but for other people not me it's about (60:12 - 60:17)
340 (60:16 - 60:20)
000 uh USD so (60:17 - 60:22)
because especially because the pound has (60:20 - 60:24)
been taking it the pond is the pound has (60:22 - 60:27)
been taking a pounding if they have (60:24 - 60:31)
unopened booster boxes that (60:27 - 60:33)
that could really add value there like (60:31 - 60:36)
could not be worth 340k yeah there's no (60:33 - 60:39)
like if she had like an unopened first (60:36 - 60:41)
edition fossil set what is that like 80 (60:39 - 60:44)
000 right there if it's not first (60:41 - 60:46)
edition it's probably like twenty (60:44 - 60:47)
thousand dollars I mean I say that (60:46 - 60:49)
somebody's probably gonna quickly write (60:47 - 60:50)
in the comments that actually fossil is (60:49 - 60:53)
like like yeah I'm sure it's it's some (60:50 - 60:56)
ridiculous price yeah on the one of the (60:53 - 60:59)
uh captions it says highlights of the (60:56 - 61:01)
collection include three German first (60:59 - 61:04)
edition sealed base set packs (61:01 - 61:07)
assigned Japanese Mew purse plush and a (61:04 - 61:09)
display stand (61:07 - 61:12)
I don't remember German cards being (61:09 - 61:14)
worth a whole lot but apparently it's (61:12 - 61:16)
the number one highlight because it's (61:14 - 61:19)
the first thing they name (61:16 - 61:21)
German first edition sealed base set (61:19 - 61:24)
packs though I mean if they if she has (61:21 - 61:25)
those (61:24 - 61:28)
then she's gotta have other yeah yeah if (61:25 - 61:30)
she has like sealed if she has three (61:28 - 61:32)
sealed base set packs I'm sure she has (61:30 - 61:35)
other sealed packs as as well so it's (61:32 - 61:36)
like (61:35 - 61:39)
cards probably add a lot to this (61:36 - 61:42)
um anything signed like it's a signed (61:39 - 61:44)
Japanese mu well who signed it was it (61:42 - 61:47)
Masuda that signed it like (61:44 - 61:49)
I wish that I (61:47 - 61:52)
had money to just give her because this (61:49 - 61:54)
sucks like imagine being passionate (61:52 - 61:56)
about it and being this excited about (61:54 - 61:59)
collecting because I because she said (61:56 - 62:00)
that she's selling it for financial (61:59 - 62:02)
reasons I doubt that she's like oh now (62:00 - 62:06)
is the time like I've been keeping all (62:02 - 62:09)
of this because I wanted to make all (62:06 - 62:11)
this profit and black but but it's now (62:09 - 62:12)
the time I feel like now is the time (62:11 - 62:14)
though right (62:12 - 62:18)
not with the British pound dumping down (62:14 - 62:21)
not the time maybe the time was a year (62:18 - 62:22)
ago (62:21 - 62:24)
I don't know it's just (62:22 - 62:26)
that's issue I mean that's the thing (62:24 - 62:28)
with Pokemon cards too I like remember (62:26 - 62:30)
when we had like five episodes in a row (62:28 - 62:33)
like talking about how expensive Pokemon (62:30 - 62:35)
cards have become and I remember just (62:33 - 62:37)
like countless people coming in being (62:35 - 62:39)
like prices are only going to go up only (62:37 - 62:42)
gonna go up and it's like get off yeah (62:39 - 62:44)
they're not gonna keep going up there's (62:42 - 62:46)
going to be a time where the pandemic is (62:44 - 62:49)
this is for for audio listeners air (62:46 - 62:50)
quote over (62:49 - 62:53)
uh and a lot of people feel like it's (62:50 - 62:57)
over now and like it reflects in card (62:53 - 62:59)
prices like people aren't buying Pokemon (62:57 - 63:01)
cards anymore they're using their money (62:59 - 63:03)
to go to bars or to go to restaurants or (63:01 - 63:06)
to go to baseball games or NASCAR events (63:03 - 63:08)
I don't know why I picked NASCAR but you (63:06 - 63:10)
know they're they're not buying cards as (63:08 - 63:12)
much anymore they're doing other stuff (63:10 - 63:15)
and the amount of people who set their (63:12 - 63:17)
cards off to PSA to get slabbed and now (63:15 - 63:18)
there's just (63:17 - 63:22)
thousands of slabs on eBay (63:18 - 63:25)
that no one wants to buy yeah (63:22 - 63:27)
yeah people have stopped buying Pokemon (63:25 - 63:30)
so like is now the right time to sell is (63:27 - 63:32)
she selling because she strongly (63:30 - 63:33)
believes the right time to sell or she (63:32 - 63:36)
just really needs the money uh I don't (63:33 - 63:37)
know maybe last year was the better time (63:36 - 63:40)
to sell like it's so hard to say like (63:37 - 63:42)
would you have gotten more money if you (63:40 - 63:43)
sold a year ago would you get more money (63:42 - 63:46)
if you wait five more years like if you (63:43 - 63:49)
need the money you need the money right (63:46 - 63:52)
yep I I mean I mean I (63:49 - 63:57)
there could be a number of reasons why (63:52 - 63:59)
she's selling like yeah did you say is (63:57 - 64:01)
for financial reasons we could be like I (63:59 - 64:03)
just want to keep this up anymore and I (64:01 - 64:06)
want to get out while the getting's good (64:03 - 64:06)
um (64:06 - 64:09)
but yeah I mean I hope she's selling it (64:06 - 64:11)
not like if I don't sell it I lose my (64:09 - 64:13)
house that's that's the way that it's (64:11 - 64:16)
it's see I read it I don't know I don't (64:13 - 64:18)
know if that's true no I I I'm imagining (64:16 - 64:20)
as I I want to get out while the (64:18 - 64:22)
getting's good and I'm just not (64:20 - 64:23)
interested in having this massive (64:22 - 64:26)
collection in my house anymore believe (64:23 - 64:29)
