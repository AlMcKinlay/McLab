I am recording (0:01 - 0:04)
[Music] (0:05 - 0:16)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:14 - 0:17)
the (0:16 - 0:20)
614th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:17 - 0:23)
it&#39;s super effective I&#39;m your host Steve (0:20 - 0:24)
with me is (0:23 - 0:26)
Hannah I am (0:24 - 0:31)
here I I yep (0:26 - 0:34)
hi hello I&#39;m in a different place there (0:31 - 0:36)
are no Pokemon posters in the background (0:34 - 0:38)
yet I have them ready to be put up but I (0:36 - 0:40)
don&#39;t want to have the command strips (0:38 - 0:42)
today different so I&#39;m (0:40 - 0:46)
here Greg also here I am also here I am (0:42 - 0:51)
in the same place it hasn&#39;t changed I (0:46 - 0:54)
still have this uh Elite Trainer Box (0:51 - 0:57)
that I got at Costco that I still (0:54 - 0:59)
haven&#39;t opened because I don&#39;t know what (0:57 - 1:02)
to do with the cards once I open them so (0:59 - 1:04)
they are sitting in there until I have a (1:02 - 1:06)
plan which I don&#39;t put back in the elely (1:04 - 1:08)
trainer (1:06 - 1:10)
box well then I&#39;d like have to do (1:08 - 1:11)
something with the Elite Trainer Box so (1:10 - 1:13)
it&#39;s just sitting there right now until (1:11 - 1:15)
I have a better just it needs to warm up (1:13 - 1:17)
so I can open all my doors and throw (1:15 - 1:19)
things out of my yard for things to get (1:17 - 1:21)
garbage like that is the key to cleaning (1:19 - 1:23)
out my house as I have to be able to (1:21 - 1:25)
have quick access outside to get it out (1:23 - 1:26)
of the house because otherwise they move (1:25 - 1:29)
it to the room the storing room to throw (1:26 - 1:31)
it out when it&#39;s nice and then it just (1:29 - 1:33)
sits in the storing room (1:31 - 1:35)
forever are you just going to throw the (1:33 - 1:38)
Pokemon cards out on the curb then no (1:35 - 1:40)
okay but so I have a so we have a fut (1:38 - 1:43)
ton from when we were in (1:40 - 1:43)
college and so that thing has been in (1:43 - 1:48)
our house (1:46 - 1:51)
unused since (1:48 - 1:51)
1994 uh it needs to (1:53 - 1:58)
go (1:56 - 2:00)
somewhere I don&#39;t know where yet but (1:58 - 2:02)
winter is never a time to make a (2:00 - 2:04)
decision of that has to go somewhere it (2:02 - 2:07)
has to be warm so that we can get it out (2:04 - 2:09)
of the house because it may just be (2:07 - 2:10)
chucked off the back porch because I (2:09 - 2:12)
don&#39;t want to carry that frame down (2:10 - 2:15)
those stairs again which (2:12 - 2:17)
means look that it&#39;s a whole process (2:15 - 2:20)
it&#39;s a whole thing to get this house (2:17 - 2:24)
fixed again it has to down house and (2:20 - 2:27)
then you start over yeah well that&#39;s (2:24 - 2:30)
also tempting (2:27 - 2:30)
just just start fresh just start I (2:31 - 2:36)
mean somebody we get those hey will&#39;ll (2:37 - 2:43)
pay whatever for a house as is uh and (2:40 - 2:44)
everyone was (2:43 - 2:48)
like how serious are you as (2:44 - 2:51)
is uh well speaking of starting fresh (2:48 - 2:53)
there&#39;s a flower (2:51 - 2:55)
festival uh by the time you&#39;re listening (2:53 - 2:56)
to this it should be starting in Pokemon (2:55 - 2:58)
sleep we also have some Pokemon unite (2:56 - 3:01)
news uh we have some stolen Pokemon (2:58 - 3:03)
cards maybe gray can relate to that ETB (3:01 - 3:07)
sitting behind from Costco don&#39;t tell (3:03 - 3:08)
anybody that I have it I don&#39;t be ripped (3:07 - 3:11)
off and then (3:08 - 3:14)
uh it&#39;s unavoidable but we have to talk (3:11 - 3:19)
about the Pokemon go Avatar update uh so (3:14 - 3:22)
that that also I went to Disney so I can (3:19 - 3:23)
tell you my Pokemon go experience at (3:22 - 3:27)
Disney I went to Disney too a year ago (3:23 - 3:29)
well and you&#39;ve played at all of America (3:27 - 3:33)

start with the Pokemon sleep F flower (3:33 - 3:41)
festival okay uh we got the 1.5 update I (3:36 - 3:42)
believe that went through because there (3:41 - 3:44)
was maintenance I don&#39;t know what update (3:42 - 3:46)
we&#39;re on I think there was also a mini (3:44 - 3:47)

recently um we might be on like 5.0.1 (3:47 - 3:52)
doesn&#39;t matter the game updated and they (3:50 - 3:55)
added new stuff as they prepared for the (3:52 - 3:59)

important thing out of the way here you (3:59 - 4:03)

Shiny Pokemon which I think like set the (4:03 - 4:09)
Poke the very small Pokemon sleep (4:07 - 4:11)
Community but very active they set it on (4:09 - 4:14)
they all loved (4:11 - 4:14)
it I need a (4:14 - 4:20)
Pokemon in shiny form that I like enough (4:17 - 4:21)
to be my (4:20 - 4:24)
icon cuz I have a bunch of stuff that I (4:21 - 4:26)

camping C while moving anymore (4:57 - 5:01)
po sleep (5:02 - 5:06)
experience camping C there&#39;s nowhere to (5:03 - 5:08)
put the (5:06 - 5:08)
Plus+ Greg you just got to go to topalo (5:09 - 5:13)
and get that shiny Sab (5:11 - 5:16)
eye look I&#39;m (5:13 - 5:19)
on what what is the fairy island called (5:16 - 5:22)
lapis yeah I&#39;m on lapis because I want (5:19 - 5:26)
to try to get the shiny rals too look I (5:22 - 5:28)
every time I go to lapis I feel like I&#39;m (5:26 - 5:30)
17 years behind because I have to do all (5:28 - 5:31)
events in Green Grass and it&#39;s like (5:30 - 5:33)
you&#39;re at Master ring cuz you opened up (5:31 - 5:35)
the app and then I go to lapis and it&#39;s (5:33 - 5:37)
like good luck getting out of basic (5:35 - 5:42)
loser lavis is tough like come on like I (5:37 - 5:45)
think I just got to ultra one today and (5:42 - 5:46)
I&#39;m like you know (5:45 - 5:48)
what now there&#39;s another event coming (5:46 - 5:51)
and I have to go back to green grass (5:48 - 5:55)
aisle uh you don&#39;t have to actually uh (5:51 - 5:58)
the new Flower Festival event is (5:55 - 6:00)
introducing com (5:58 - 6:03)
um and there will be items you can of (6:00 - 6:05)
course buy you can buy a bundle pack (6:03 - 6:08)
that has a Chikorita incense a comet (6:05 - 6:11)
incense uh an Eevee incense one of them (6:08 - 6:14)
will include a leaf stone I&#39;m just going (6:11 - 6:16)
to let you guys know that Leafeon is not (6:14 - 6:18)
a good Pokemon in this game so that&#39;s (6:16 - 6:21)
just bait at that (6:18 - 6:22)
point one of the ones they&#39;re (6:21 - 6:25)
highlighting though learn from me that (6:22 - 6:27)
evolved my very good Eevee into a (6:25 - 6:29)
Leafeon because I didn&#39;t know at the (6:27 - 6:31)
time the first like two weeks of the (6:29 - 6:33)
game that leafy that (6:31 - 6:37)
Eevee&#39;s skill changes when it evolves (6:33 - 6:39)
and all the eveve lutions have different (6:37 - 6:42)
skills it&#39;s the only Pokemon to do that (6:39 - 6:43)
I (6:42 - 6:48)
think is the Eevee line where so far (6:43 - 6:50)
yeah oh no there&#39;s one other Pokemon (6:48 - 6:54)
Gade changes oh yeah that makes sense (6:50 - 6:56)
roals cilia gav war is all the same but (6:54 - 6:58)
if you change it to Glade there is I (6:56 - 7:00)
don&#39;t remember what it changes to but it (6:58 - 7:05)
is different uh com will be appearing at (7:00 - 7:09)
Greengrass at the beach and then at (7:05 - 7:12)
Lakeside lapis those are your three (7:09 - 7:16)
options there will also be a boost to (7:12 - 7:19)
fairy and grass (7:16 - 7:22)
Pokemon and they (7:19 - 7:24)
mentioned in one throw away line (7:22 - 7:27)
something about shinies (7:24 - 7:30)
but it&#39;s really hard to decipher what (7:27 - 7:34)
they exactly mean through (7:30 - 7:34)
that let me see if I can find the exact (7:34 - 7:40)
line yeah that&#39;s not even in the news (7:37 - 7:43)
update oh yeah here it is it was the (7:40 - 7:45)
news article right before it says under (7:43 - 7:49)
bonuses we will have one Pokemon will be (7:45 - 7:52)
hungry for sure your dishes will be set (7:49 - 7:53)
to (7:52 - 7:58)
salads uh Pokemon will a few Pokemon (7:53 - 8:01)
will appear regard less of your sleep (7:58 - 8:04)
type for the day uh certain Pokemon are (8:01 - 8:06)
more likely to appear which is the the (8:04 - 8:08)
grass and fairy Pokemon that I just said (8:06 - 8:10)
and then it says you may meet certain (8:08 - 8:13)
Shiny Pokemon that&#39;s (8:10 - 8:16)
it that what that (8:13 - 8:19)
means who know certain Shiny (8:16 - 8:21)
Pokemon I would say you could do that (8:19 - 8:24)
technically every day (8:21 - 8:24)
yeah um but yeah come I don&#39;t think we (8:26 - 8:34)
know what comfy does fully B com besides (8:31 - 8:35)
it&#39;s (8:34 - 8:37)
fairy (8:35 - 8:40)
um and we don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know (8:37 - 8:43)
if it&#39;ll carry corn or something like (8:40 - 8:45)
that (8:43 - 8:45)
unsure uh probably by the time this goes (8:45 - 8:51)
up everyone will know but I if you like (8:47 - 8:53)
com I don&#39;t think you care what it does (8:51 - 8:55)
you probably just want it (8:53 - 9:00)
mhm um if you don&#39;t care about k (8:55 - 9:03)
technically Igglybuff Jigglypuff and (9:00 - 9:08)
Wigglytuff are boosted on every island (9:03 - 9:13)
except that iggly buff is on green grass (9:08 - 9:16)
Beach and taupe and you want an iggly (9:13 - 9:18)
buff oh and L side pretty much (9:16 - 9:20)
everywhere that is in snow drop you want (9:18 - 9:21)
an iggly (9:20 - 9:23)
buff because then when you evolve it to (9:21 - 9:25)
Wiggly tough the main skill goes up for (9:23 - 9:30)
free so if you don&#39;t have a good (9:25 - 9:34)
iggly buff this is your chance to find (9:30 - 9:38)
one what shiny jiggly buff you well yeah (9:34 - 9:40)
get you could get a shiny too I do think (9:38 - 9:43)
this whole event is uh is bait to make (9:40 - 9:48)
you waste your stuff before another (9:43 - 9:48)
legendary that you&#39;re just saying that (9:48 - 9:53)
because of the Leafeon (9:50 - 9:53)
though yeah the leaat itself is (9:56 - 10:01)
definitely bait uh cuz Le out&#39;s bad no I (9:58 - 10:03)
think I think (10:01 - 10:07)
like if you are spending your points on (10:03 - 10:09)
Poke Balls and you&#39;re then using your (10:07 - 10:13)
pokeballs on here you&#39;re draining your (10:09 - 10:15)
points so therefore when another Legend (10:13 - 10:17)
comes you might not have enough points (10:15 - 10:18)
to get a master ball or you might have (10:17 - 10:21)
enough points to get (10:18 - 10:23)
pokeballs I think the the bait part of (10:21 - 10:26)
it is just not having enough pokeballs I (10:23 - 10:28)
mean the easy solution to that is just (10:26 - 10:30)
spend money but that&#39;s like the solution (10:28 - 10:33)
Masters is like I&#39;m saving my polls for (10:30 - 10:36)
this character oh I&#39;m out of polls I got (10:33 - 10:38)
to spend money now except to a certain (10:36 - 10:40)
extent Pokemon sleep doesn&#39;t let you (10:38 - 10:42)
because they have that limit on how many (10:40 - 10:44)
master ball biscuits you can get yeah (10:42 - 10:46)
that&#39;s so (10:44 - 10:46)
rude they&#39;re stopping you from spending (10:46 - 10:50)
too much (10:49 - 10:53)
money I mean let me have (10:50 - 10:55)
two can you not hold two master balls at (10:53 - 10:58)
the same time I don&#39;t remember I I I (10:55 - 10:59)
have a bunch it was like no you can&#39;t (10:58 - 11:01)
have that yeah oh you you can only (10:59 - 11:04)
purchase one a month yeah yeah I was (11:01 - 11:06)
like I think you can know (11:04 - 11:09)
too I don&#39;t think the event is f i just (11:06 - 11:11)
think you care more about legendaries (11:09 - 11:12)
than anything else in this game it&#39;s (11:11 - 11:14)
what it&#39;s seeming like no I didn&#39;t care (11:12 - 11:17)
about R I told everyone that raicho was (11:14 - 11:19)
bad and not to waste their master ball (11:17 - 11:21)
on it that&#39;s what I (11:19 - 11:24)
did but now you&#39;re saying save all your (11:21 - 11:26)
resources for the next (11:24 - 11:30)
legendary yeah yeah cuz there there I (11:26 - 11:33)
mean the game is resource (11:30 - 11:35)
restrictive like you can&#39;t just like get (11:33 - 11:37)
a new Pokemon and get it up to like (11:35 - 11:39)
level 50 right (11:37 - 11:42)
away true right if I if I I got (11:39 - 11:45)
a okay Charmeleon I don&#39;t have nearly (11:42 - 11:47)
enough candy to like I could get the (11:45 - 11:49)
Charmeleon up to 30 but then I can&#39;t (11:47 - 11:50)
evolve it to Charizard but if I evolve (11:49 - 11:52)
it to Charizard I can&#39;t get it up to (11:50 - 11:55)
30 yeah if I did I would have to go to (11:52 - 11:57)
topalo and I don&#39;t want to go (11:55 - 12:00)
there it&#39;s so good though uh but this is (11:57 - 12:02)
a good event to get igly buff like you (12:00 - 12:04)
said this is a good event to I would (12:02 - 12:06)
guess that one of the shinies they&#39;re (12:04 - 12:08)
hinting at is probably a higher chance (12:06 - 12:10)
of shiny Eevee that&#39;s just a guess that (12:08 - 12:12)
is definitely not anything they&#39;ve said (12:10 - 12:14)
but seeing as Leafeon is one of the (12:12 - 12:17)
highlighted Pokemon for this event that (12:14 - 12:19)
would be a guess of (12:17 - 12:22)
mine and I think people would be excited (12:19 - 12:24)
about that I don&#39;t think this is a (12:22 - 12:26)
throwaway event plus there&#39;s the new (12:24 - 12:28)
Pokemon and we don&#39;t know how good compe (12:26 - 12:31)
is yet (12:28 - 12:34)
uh Bulbasaur should be boosted you (12:31 - 12:36)
should get yourself a good Bulbasaur uh (12:34 - 12:38)
bell sprout would be boosted Bells (12:36 - 12:40)
Sprout is good I&#39;m I&#39;m I I guess like a (12:38 - 12:43)
lot of people started playing sleep when (12:40 - 12:45)
we when Hannah and I convinced Bobby to (12:43 - 12:47)
play sleep so I am I&#39;m just letting (12:45 - 12:49)
those people know what you they should (12:47 - 12:51)
be looking out for you should ignore the (12:49 - 12:54)
Clefairy line you don&#39;t need that don&#39;t (12:51 - 12:55)
waste your biscuits on Clefairy (12:54 - 12:58)
metronome is just too random try to get (12:55 - 13:00)
a good Bulbasaur if if you&#39;re like what (12:58 - 13:01)
makes a good (13:00 - 13:05)
Bulbasaur you want skill trigger (13:01 - 13:06)
ingredient (13:05 - 13:09)
finder uh inventory inventory there you (13:06 - 13:12)
go yep if you want a good bell sprout (13:09 - 13:14)
bell sprout very good you want Bell (13:12 - 13:16)
Sprout&#39;s very good at getting potatoes (13:14 - 13:19)
so one make sure it can get potatoes at (13:16 - 13:23)
level 30 same thing you want ingredient (13:19 - 13:25)
finder uh literally what I just listed (13:23 - 13:26)
for (13:25 - 13:28)
[Laughter] (13:26 - 13:32)
bulb uh chck super good uh that&#39;s (13:28 - 13:34)
actually what I&#39;m missing uh Chikorita (13:32 - 13:36)
you are looking for Berry finder s (13:34 - 13:38)
that&#39;s pretty much all you&#39;re looking (13:36 - 13:41)
for either at say it&#39;s good for looking (13:38 - 13:44)
for one with with cacao too that&#39;s one (13:41 - 13:47)
of my best cacao finders (13:44 - 13:50)
oh yeah cacao um but yeah the main thing (13:47 - 13:52)
you&#39;re looking for on anything that is a (13:50 - 13:54)
berry finder which is Chikorita is just (13:52 - 13:56)
barinder s you want it in the first like (13:54 - 13:59)
two slots though level 10 or level 25 (13:56 - 14:01)
I&#39;ve been playing this game since day (13:59 - 14:03)
one I have two Pokemon at level 50 so (14:01 - 14:05)
keep that in (14:03 - 14:07)
mind so if you have Berry finder s at (14:05 - 14:10)
level 100 number one we can&#39;t even get (14:07 - 14:13)
to level 100 yet number two it&#39;s almost (14:10 - 14:17)
it&#39;s been nine months and barely any of (14:13 - 14:21)
us have level 50 so um yeah I was just (14:17 - 14:22)
looking at Green Grass stuff those are (14:21 - 14:23)
probably the top three you&#39;re looking (14:22 - 14:25)
for Bulbasaur (14:23 - 14:27)
Bellsprout sorry top four Bulbasaur (14:25 - 14:31)
Bells Sprout Chikorita and eagly buff (14:27 - 14:34)
those are your targets if you don&#39;t have (14:31 - 14:36)
those I still don&#39;t have a good Totodile (14:34 - 14:39)
either but that&#39;s not boosted this (14:36 - 14:41)
week I might go to beach because Beach (14:39 - 14:44)
does have the Chikorita (14:41 - 14:46)
boost yeah no buur on beach but I don&#39;t (14:44 - 14:48)
need (14:46 - 14:48)
that hard to say I don&#39;t want to go back (14:50 - 14:54)
to lap like lapis two weeks in a row is (14:52 - 14:56)
just (14:54 - 15:01)
brutal it is it is so brutal (14:56 - 15:02)
also I got one Stuffle all week and it (15:01 - 15:06)
was bad I just want a good (15:02 - 15:06)
Stuffle oh the other thing they did (15:07 - 15:12)
about Pokemon sleep is they changed (15:09 - 15:15)
breakfast from 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. I (15:12 - 15:18)
swear they&#39;re listening to this show cuz (15:15 - 15:20)
I complained about this I also (15:18 - 15:22)
complained that slow King was bad and (15:20 - 15:25)
they fixed both slow King and slow bro (15:22 - 15:26)
which is (15:25 - 15:29)
great uh all that means for those that (15:26 - 15:31)
are not paying attention is both can get (15:29 - 15:33)
ingredients a little bit faster slow bro (15:31 - 15:35)
can get a little bit more ingredients (15:33 - 15:39)
than slow King but regardless they fixed (15:35 - 15:42)
slow bro and slow King they are better (15:39 - 15:44)
which is awesome uh but they did change (15:42 - 15:47)
breakfast from 6:00 a.m. to 400 a.m. so (15:44 - 15:50)
the day in Pokemon sleep starts at 4:00 (15:47 - 15:53)
a.m. and the main reason they changed (15:50 - 15:56)
this is one it makes logical sense (15:53 - 15:58)
although I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s why they (15:56 - 16:00)
changed it but apparently people were (15:58 - 16:01)
time (16:00 - 16:04)
traveling to (16:01 - 16:08)
Sunday wait Monday morning but it was (16:04 - 16:10)
still Sunday (16:08 - 16:13)
dinner and so they were sneaking in an (16:10 - 16:14)
extra (16:13 - 16:18)
meal at the start of (16:14 - 16:20)
Monday because Sunday is already over (16:18 - 16:22)
you don&#39;t really need that last meal (16:20 - 16:24)
because it&#39;s it might not change (16:22 - 16:26)
anything cuz you would need cuz you&#39;re (16:24 - 16:29)
probably master rank 10 or whatever um (16:26 - 16:31)
so now the day starts at 4:00 a.m. this (16:29 - 16:34)
is so amazing for me because I normally (16:31 - 16:37)
start my sleep routine at 3: and then I (16:34 - 16:39)
you know I do my nightly Tik Tock and (16:37 - 16:42)
and then maybe it&#39;s you know 4 4 a.m. (16:39 - 16:45)
and I&#39;ve been on Tik Tok for too long (16:42 - 16:48)
and so I can give my Pokemon breakfast (16:45 - 16:50)
then go night night and then I don&#39;t (16:48 - 16:52)
have to worry about missing breakfast (16:50 - 16:54)
anymore I seem to recall you saying (16:52 - 16:56)
before that Pokemon sleep had convinced (16:54 - 16:58)
you to start going to bed at 3:00 (16:56 - 17:02)
instead of 4 4:00 because of the the day (16:58 - 17:04)
change over there and now I think it&#39;s (17:02 - 17:07)
pushing you back in the other direction (17:04 - 17:09)
here look when I say I&#39;m going to bed it (17:07 - 17:11)
means I&#39;m pressing the button and I am (17:09 - 17:13)
in bed doesn&#39;t actually mean I&#39;m (17:11 - 17:14)
sleeping (17:13 - 17:18)
yet I&#39;ve just made it to the bed which (17:14 - 17:20)
is a big start which is a big thing my (17:18 - 17:22)
sleep machine has been lying all week (17:20 - 17:25)
and I&#39;m very mad at (17:22 - 17:29)
it I&#39;m lying yeah I hit that button at (17:25 - 17:33)
11:30 every night and then all week it (17:29 - 17:36)
has been randomly picking a time between (17:33 - 17:39)
11:30 and 2: a.m. when it says I started (17:36 - 17:43)
sleeping yesterday it picked 1:45 a.m. (17:39 - 17:47)
and I&#39;m like I was dead I was dead to (17:43 - 17:50)
the world at 1 in the morning do you not (17:47 - 17:52)
pregame your Pokeball (17:50 - 17:56)
plus I what what do you mean cheat no (17:52 - 18:00)
this what do you mean pregame (17:56 - 18:03)
the Pokeball plus needs I think it needs (18:00 - 18:07)
like nine minutes of no movement to just (18:03 - 18:10)
to decipher that you have begun sleeping (18:07 - 18:12)
if it doesn&#39;t get that it will still (18:10 - 18:15)
consider you&#39;re you&#39;re awake okay but (18:12 - 18:18)
I&#39;m dead I am I am not I am not (18:15 - 18:21)
thrashing around like a monster when I&#39;m (18:18 - 18:24)
sound as sleep at (18:21 - 18:27)
midnight it has been primed for half an (18:24 - 18:29)
hour (18:27 - 18:32)
before I go on Greg are if when it is (18:29 - 18:35)
working for you are you a slumber or are (18:32 - 18:37)
you a dozer or snoozer like when it when (18:35 - 18:39)
when you do get like a a thing are you (18:37 - 18:42)
because I&#39;m almost always Slumber I get (18:39 - 18:44)
all three again it just Rand like to (18:42 - 18:48)
randomly pick what I have oh I way to (18:44 - 18:51)
check my last week was I am constantly (18:48 - 18:54)
Slumber unless I&#39;m like at a hotel and (18:51 - 18:57)
then it&#39;s dozing or (18:54 - 19:01)
whatever I know I get dozing and Slumber (18:57 - 19:03)
I get them all I see them all okay I (19:01 - 19:06)
don&#39;t know so anyways what if you are (19:03 - 19:09)
having trouble with it sleeping what you (19:06 - 19:11)
do is you put it on your bedside table (19:09 - 19:14)
for 10 minutes and then you move it to (19:11 - 19:16)
the bed and then there will be no issue (19:14 - 19:18)
with it like saying you went to bed at (19:16 - 19:20)
11:30 but it started recording at like (19:18 - 19:24)
2:00 a.m. it&#39;s the it&#39;s the last it&#39;s (19:20 - 19:25)
the first 10 minutes and like the last (19:24 - 19:28)
10 minutes how it like starts and (19:25 - 19:30)
decides your sleep (19:28 - 19:32)
all right sleep data will my sleep data (19:30 - 19:34)
tell me what kind (19:32 - 19:36)
of it should tell you what you got last (19:34 - 19:38)
night I think I got I got slumbering (19:36 - 19:40)
last night I think I got snoozing last (19:38 - 19:42)
night oh okay yeah yeah but you are you (19:40 - 19:44)
also said it didn&#39;t start it until what (19:42 - 19:46)
like a couple hours until after the (19:44 - 19:49)
night before I got (19:46 - 19:49)
slumbering so let me see slumbering (19:51 - 19:56)
slumbering slumbering snoozing snoozing (19:53 - 19:59)
snoozing dozing how I ever get snoozing (19:56 - 20:00)
I think I always get I got three (19:59 - 20:02)
snoozing in a row I don&#39;t know why I (20:00 - 20:07)
never get snoozing I got double (20:02 - 20:07)
dozing I got a balance type I&#39;d never (20:07 - 20:13)
seen that before balance is when it&#39;s (20:10 - 20:16)
perfect well not perfect but (20:13 - 20:18)
it balance is just you have the option (20:16 - 20:19)
to get all (20:18 - 20:22)
three yes when you but when I look at (20:19 - 20:24)
the percentages it says balance type (20:22 - 20:29)
dozing 23% snoozing 52% slumbering 25% (20:24 - 20:33)
it&#39;s all relative to your previous (20:29 - 20:33)
nights this (20:33 - 20:37)
game that that is right Greg it is a (20:38 - 20:43)
game pack of (20:41 - 20:46)
eyes it is a game that encourages (20:43 - 20:49)
healthy habits no it doesn&#39;t the game (20:46 - 20:51)
that&#39;s encouraging you to stay up till (20:49 - 20:54)
400 a.m. it gets I would look I would (20:51 - 20:56)
already be up till 4:00 a.m. but I am in (20:54 - 21:01)
the bed it gets me to the bed at 3: (20:56 - 21:01)
Pokemon unite Greg uh I believe are a (21:02 - 21:08)
lot is happening we are on Battle pass (21:05 - 21:12)
23 but ranked 19 or something like that (21:08 - 21:15)
yeah so it is season rank 19 which has (21:12 - 21:17)
brought in a bunch of changes it is (21:15 - 21:19)
Battle pass (21:17 - 21:22)
23 which is a different thing than the (21:19 - 21:24)
ranked and then there was a (21:22 - 21:26)
patch what do you want to hear about (21:24 - 21:30)
first uh i h i have it in front of (21:26 - 21:34)
me um and then I think failings comes in (21:30 - 21:37)
a week or so the 25th Y and uh there (21:34 - 21:40)
will be a commemorative event to get (21:37 - 21:43)
failings for free I believe (21:40 - 21:45)
oh (21:43 - 21:49)
um I well I I have off uh the patch (21:45 - 21:53)
notes uh garbage King once again the we (21:49 - 21:57)

looks like it got nerfed buzwell got (22:12 - 22:18)
nerfed Mega meww y got nerfed Machamp (22:14 - 22:21)
got buffed Machamp got buffed Snorlax (22:18 - 22:26)
got buffed yep EA slash got buffed (22:21 - 22:31)
yep Gyarados got nerfed it did did uh (22:26 - 22:34)
Hoopa got nerfed (22:31 - 22:38)
buffed bed and it got it got birthed it (22:34 - 22:40)
got a little bit of both I don&#39;t know (22:38 - 22:43)
what they&#39;re doing with Hoopa yet (22:40 - 22:43)
hoopa&#39;s been buffed a little bit to make (22:44 - 22:49)
it a more viable choice but I don&#39;t (22:46 - 22:54)
think trick is that great uh Umbreon (22:49 - 22:59)
got buffed kind of so wish got buffed to (22:54 - 23:02)
make it a more viable healing support (22:59 - 23:06)
and file play got buffed so you can (23:02 - 23:10)
actually be a slightly better (23:06 - 23:12)
Defender uh I (23:10 - 23:16)
but uman still was always great so we (23:12 - 23:17)
see how this plays out I don&#39;t know why (23:16 - 23:20)
they did this one Zoll got buffed yep (23:17 - 23:21)
zum roll needed (23:20 - 23:25)
help uh espon got nerfed yeah ESPN (23:21 - 23:29)
needed to be nerfed miara got nerfed El (23:25 - 23:32)
go got nerfed well pollen puff got (23:29 - 23:36)
nerfed one part of it got nerfed yes (23:32 - 23:39)
cotton guard got (23:36 - 23:43)
buffed uh Crustle got uh their move (23:39 - 23:46)
fixed so that they won&#39;t get interrupted (23:43 - 23:48)
it can&#39;t go into its unite move which is (23:46 - 23:49)
super (23:48 - 23:52)
frustrating excuse my knowledge uh I (23:49 - 23:55)
thought Leafeon and Boswell were the two (23:52 - 23:57)
threats in unite and I don&#39;t see Leafeon (23:55 - 24:00)
on this list (23:57 - 24:02)
not to be confused with Leafeon Pokemon (24:00 - 24:03)
sleep because Leafeon Pokemon sleep is (24:02 - 24:06)
bad just Leafeon and Pokemon unite (24:03 - 24:09)
apparently very good uh Leafeon isn&#39;t (24:06 - 24:13)
that big of a threat it&#39;s still good but (24:09 - 24:16)
it&#39;s still very it&#39;s still very squishy (24:13 - 24:19)
so I don&#39;t think (24:16 - 24:22)
they want to mess with that it&#39;s also so (24:19 - 24:24)
here&#39;s the weird (24:22 - 24:28)
thing they put they put these changes in (24:24 - 24:31)
before links came out which is usually (24:28 - 24:33)
not the way they do these changes (24:31 - 24:35)
usually they wait for the new thing to (24:33 - 24:36)
happen and then they rebalance (24:35 - 24:40)
everything so this is (24:36 - 24:40)
a and it makes me think that they are (24:41 - 24:46)
trying to balance things right away so (24:43 - 24:49)
that failing feels a lot better when (24:46 - 24:52)
it&#39;s released than it was before it&#39;s (24:49 - 24:55)
also sort of weird that they decided to (24:52 - 25:00)
hit Mega meww y when season 19 EXs are (24:55 - 25:04)
banned and master ranked so it felt like (25:00 - 25:07)
I mean I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re I don&#39;t (25:04 - 25:09)
know why you&#39;re doing this now but okay (25:07 - 25:11)
I mean there all of these changes were (25:09 - 25:14)
needed I mean they are all to make (25:11 - 25:19)
things better and to diversify play so I (25:14 - 25:22)
think they&#39;re all good like eligos is po (25:19 - 25:23)
pollen puff was (25:22 - 25:28)
op um everybody was just using it um so (25:23 - 25:31)
it didn&#39;t need to be be decreased um I (25:28 - 25:34)
think meow (25:31 - 25:34)
Gara needed to be nerfed because people (25:34 - 25:38)
were no longer wanting to play Leafeon (25:37 - 25:41)
because mascarada did it better it just (25:38 - 25:44)
was better at the job that Leafeon was (25:41 - 25:47)
doing um espan has (25:44 - 25:51)
been overpowered for a very long time uh (25:47 - 25:53)
and was a much needed (25:51 - 25:57)
change uh this is all because of the big (25:53 - 25:59)
changes to season (25:57 - 26:04)
19 um the biggest change is again ex (25:59 - 26:07)
licenses are banned in master rank which (26:04 - 26:09)
people are excited about right yes it&#39;s (26:07 - 26:10)
great when they&#39;re best but the thing (26:09 - 26:12)
people need to realize is if you&#39;re an (26:10 - 26:15)
alter Rank and if I&#39;m if you get paired (26:12 - 26:18)
with a master rank person you will (26:15 - 26:20)
probably not be able to pick (26:18 - 26:23)
ex licenses people get confused because (26:20 - 26:25)
they are like can be an ultra but if (26:23 - 26:27)
there&#39;s a master rank player in there (26:25 - 26:30)
the ex license should be banned one (26:27 - 26:33)
master ranked player out of the 10 yeah (26:30 - 26:36)
would cause that ban yep interesting so (26:33 - 26:38)
there&#39;s one or more master rank players (26:36 - 26:41)
in the group EXs are going to be (26:38 - 26:43)
banned uh so what you&#39;re saying is if (26:41 - 26:45)
you want to get to master rank you use (26:43 - 26:47)
zachian to get all the way up there (26:45 - 26:49)
that&#39;s what everybody does they use the (26:47 - 26:51)
overpower W well actually everybody uses (26:49 - 26:53)
Maron right now uh because you can just (26:51 - 26:56)
melt things across the field uh but then (26:53 - 26:58)
that all stops when you get to ultra (26:56 - 27:00)
rank so it you tend to run into a lot (26:58 - 27:02)
more Master players so you can get up (27:00 - 27:05)
through the ranks pretty quick but yeah (27:02 - 27:07)
they&#39;re doing a big change to draft (27:05 - 27:10)
picks which people need to understand (27:07 - 27:11)
hit me with (27:10 - 27:14)
it people were excited for draft yes and (27:11 - 27:16)
then they rolled it out and then people (27:14 - 27:18)
were like bummed because it didn&#39;t seem (27:16 - 27:20)
like it was accessible to a lot of (27:18 - 27:23)
people it wasn&#39;t you had to be at 1400 (27:20 - 27:26)
master rank to even get (27:23 - 27:29)
into the possibility of getting and do a (27:26 - 27:33)
draft match so you could go and be, 1400 (27:29 - 27:35)
and say I want to get a draft one and it (27:33 - 27:36)
would just never pop for you because (27:35 - 27:39)
there weren&#39;t enough people in there so (27:36 - 27:42)
they&#39;re dropping it to 1,200 so master (27:39 - 27:44)
rank starts at 1,200 so the minute you (27:42 - 27:47)
get master rank you&#39;re at 1,200 points (27:44 - 27:50)
and you&#39;d be available for draft pick (27:47 - 27:52)
big change number one big change number (27:50 - 27:54)
two one in my life the Pokemon unite (27:52 - 27:57)
draft uh the Big T number two is you (27:54 - 27:59)
have to have 14 or more unite (27:57 - 28:01)
licenses (27:59 - 28:06)
what what a what a weird arbitrary CH (28:01 - 28:09)
it&#39;s not you need to spend money to (28:06 - 28:11)
unlock more Pokemon to then be part of (28:09 - 28:14)
the draft so here&#39;s here&#39;s what was (28:11 - 28:17)
happening people would get into draft (28:14 - 28:19)
pick with 10 (28:17 - 28:22)
licenses two get (28:19 - 28:26)
banned oh and only one person can pick (28:22 - 28:28)
the same Pokemon so people were ending (28:26 - 28:31)
up at the last with nothing to choose (28:28 - 28:35)
from every option they had was gone and (28:31 - 28:37)
they could not play the game yeah they (28:35 - 28:40)
couldn&#39;t do anything so you&#39;d get to the (28:37 - 28:42)
end you&#39;re like well this match can&#39;t go (28:40 - 28:45)
forward because there&#39;s nothing I can (28:42 - 28:47)
play and then the match had to be (28:45 - 28:48)
forfeit and then you got into the same (28:47 - 28:51)
cycle that has to be such a rare thing (28:48 - 28:55)
though to be like not if everyone the (28:51 - 28:58)
same Pokemon yeah it wasn&#39;t it was not (28:55 - 29:02)
as rare as they had hoped it would be (28:58 - 29:06)
what a what an awesome oversight (29:02 - 29:08)
though well because people would play (29:06 - 29:10)
like I&#39;m going to play meww y all the (29:08 - 29:11)
way up to the top to get to the (29:10 - 29:13)
masterank and that they have like two (29:11 - 29:14)
other licenses and they&#39;re like we&#39;re (29:13 - 29:16)
Banning K mewwy and they&#39;re like well I (29:14 - 29:21)
have nothing else to do and I can&#39;t (29:16 - 29:25)
continue so you now have to have 14 or (29:21 - 29:28)
more unite licenses so that at once (29:25 - 29:30)
everything is chosen and banned you will (29:28 - 29:33)
have a Pokemon you are able to play and (29:30 - 29:35)
it will stop the fact that people would (29:33 - 29:39)
just be I can do nothing there&#39;s nothing (29:35 - 29:40)
here for me to (29:39 - 29:43)
do I do like it&#39;s hilarious and bad and (29:40 - 29:45)
it was just a weird oversight but it was (29:43 - 29:47)
like when it would happen you&#39;re like oh (29:45 - 29:50)
buddy the good news is they did at least (29:47 - 29:52)
run the numbers and it&#39;s (29:50 - 29:56)
like 70 or 80% of Master ranked players (29:52 - 30:00)
have 14 or more licenses (29:56 - 30:00)
so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not as big of an issue (30:00 - 30:06)
but it was a big enough issue for people (30:05 - 30:08)
who are at that level who only maybe (30:06 - 30:10)
played ever five license because that&#39;s (30:08 - 30:12)
what they were good at would get in (30:10 - 30:14)
Draft and be like I can (30:12 - 30:17)
do nothing um I think the concept of (30:14 - 30:21)
drafting H is is very cool I love (30:17 - 30:23)
watching it when they do the tournaments (30:21 - 30:26)
on Twitch I I think the like watching (30:23 - 30:28)
people draft and what they&#39;re picking (30:26 - 30:30)
and they&#39;re banning I think is just as (30:28 - 30:32)
interesting as like watching the match (30:30 - 30:35)
that&#39;s about to follow that being (30:32 - 30:38)
said when when I come back to unite (30:35 - 30:39)
which I want to because there&#39;s a new (30:38 - 30:41)
crar skin coming I just want to play (30:39 - 30:44)
karant so like I think everything about (30:41 - 30:47)
the draft is so cool but then it it does (30:44 - 30:48)
require you which I think is cool I (30:47 - 30:50)
think it&#39;s very cool it does require you (30:48 - 30:51)
to learn multiple characters and all (30:50 - 30:56)
that stuff but like I just want to play (30:51 - 30:58)
crar well here&#39;s the thing (30:56 - 31:02)
uh I have watched a number of team (30:58 - 31:04)
building videos where people have been (31:02 - 31:06)
putting together a team and talking (31:04 - 31:10)
about it and the conversation everybody (31:06 - 31:14)
has is what are your three what are the (31:10 - 31:16)
three that you feel comfortable playing (31:14 - 31:17)
with what&#39;s your main and then what are (31:16 - 31:21)
your two backups should your main get (31:17 - 31:24)
banned that&#39;s or chosen so you always (31:21 - 31:27)
sort of have to have three like I&#39;m (31:24 - 31:29)
gonna tell you this nobody has been (31:27 - 31:33)
picking crar lately I&#39;m safe there (31:29 - 31:37)
you&#39;re safe I have had (31:33 - 31:37)
maybe (31:37 - 31:42)
three matches recently that a crme rant (31:39 - 31:44)
was in (31:42 - 31:44)
it so you&#39;re fine so what what are your (31:44 - 31:53)
three Greg so my three uh so eligos is (31:49 - 31:56)
my main uh zarena is my (31:53 - 32:01)
backup Trev is my third backup saai if (31:56 - 32:04)
I&#39;m feeling like an absolute troll that (32:01 - 32:06)
day and I just want to make people mad (32:04 - 32:08)
then I&#39;m go sa ey because that Pokemon (32:06 - 32:12)
is not good but it&#39;s (32:08 - 32:17)
fun I can also Play I&#39;m I can also play (32:12 - 32:20)
Mewtwo I when it was free I was testing (32:17 - 32:22)
out to see how bad it was so I but again (32:20 - 32:24)
Mewtwo is a point and hit the a button (32:22 - 32:26)
and you win so like meww isn&#39;t hard to (32:24 - 32:30)
play um but my if I can&#39;t do eligos then (32:26 - 32:32)
I go to Serena if I can&#39;t do Serena then (32:30 - 32:34)
I&#39;ll go to Trevenant if I can&#39;t do (32:32 - 32:38)
Trevenant then I might do deui although (32:34 - 32:41)
I&#39;m really bad with the arrow I am bad (32:38 - 32:44)
at aiming I am not good at it I always (32:41 - 32:46)
miss yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like the (32:44 - 32:49)
characters where you have to like deui (32:46 - 32:52)
and Cinder Ras those like more pinpoint (32:49 - 32:53)
yeah the (32:52 - 32:56)
controls are not (32:53 - 32:59)
great so what you&#39;re saying is unite (32:56 - 33:01)
seems to be in a better place because of (32:59 - 33:04)
these updates because of the draft (33:01 - 33:07)
getting lowered yeah uh and because EXs (33:04 - 33:12)
are banned are banned at master rank (33:07 - 33:14)
people will still say I&#39;m an expert and (33:12 - 33:15)
somebody&#39;s playing a Mewtwo I thought (33:14 - 33:17)
they were banned they they are not (33:15 - 33:19)
banned in the lower ranks they are (33:17 - 33:21)
banned when you get to master rank they (33:19 - 33:24)
are banned at high level play um also (33:21 - 33:27)
they redid the entire start of the game (33:24 - 33:30)
you get new licenses you get new choices (33:27 - 33:32)
they&#39;ve gone back and revamped the new (33:30 - 33:38)
player experience the menus are still (33:32 - 33:41)
bad they are still awful they make no (33:38 - 33:44)
sense they are a hot cluttered mess just (33:41 - 33:47)
go where a a little red dot is figure (33:44 - 33:49)
out if you need to interact with it and (33:47 - 33:51)
move on with your life because there&#39;s (33:49 - 33:53)
not much else there (33:51 - 33:56)
perfect and then the new Battle season (33:53 - 34:00)
23 which features outfits for meww and (33:56 - 34:03)
Umbreon (34:00 - 34:05)
yep got (34:03 - 34:09)
it um okay uh let&#39;s get this last news (34:05 - 34:10)
article out of the way before we take a (34:09 - 34:13)
break Japanese police arrest a (34:10 - 34:15)
36-year-old man on suspicion of (34:13 - 34:18)
tampering with Pokemon Violet save (34:15 - 34:22)
data that&#39;s a headline uh this pull this (34:18 - 34:25)
from IGN I like that their their subline (34:22 - 34:28)
is detective Pikachu period That&#39;s (34:25 - 34:29)
that&#39;s all they (34:28 - 34:32)
wrote every time there&#39;s an article like (34:29 - 34:34)
this it&#39;s always detective Pikachu yeah (34:32 - 34:37)
yeah I haven&#39;t been a fan of IGN&#39;s (34:34 - 34:40)
journalism lately but they they they (34:37 - 34:43)
kept this short and sweet so it was like (34:40 - 34:47)
good enough for for breeding here um (34:43 - 34:49)
okay so uh police in Japan arrested a (34:47 - 34:51)
36-year-old man on suspicion of selling (34:49 - 34:54)
a legally modified Pokemon save data to (34:51 - 34:57)
customers online this practice is banned (34:54 - 34:58)
under the court (34:57 - 35:03)
2019 unfair comp competition prevention (34:58 - 35:07)
act I I I&#39;m going to Japan soon I think (35:03 - 35:09)
in 30 days and I get this question all (35:07 - 35:11)
the time of like Steve would you live in (35:09 - 35:14)
Japan and I think the answer is like I (35:11 - 35:17)
could live in Japan and probably just (35:14 - 35:24)
fine but I I always feel like the people (35:17 - 35:24)
asking have not been to other countries (35:25 - 35:31)
a lot because there&#39;s a big difference (35:29 - 35:34)
of like being a tourist for 2 weeks and (35:31 - 35:38)
then actually living there there&#39;s like (35:34 - 35:41)
a lot of weird laws that you probably (35:38 - 35:44)
just are not aware ofh because you&#39;re a (35:41 - 35:47)
tourist and you&#39;ve not had to experience (35:44 - 35:50)
that or that wouldn&#39;t come across this (35:47 - 35:52)
is just I I think like this is just a (35:50 - 35:54)
very (35:52 - 35:57)
interesting law that you just probably (35:54 - 35:59)
would not have heard of of and that also (35:57 - 36:02)
just doesn&#39;t exist in the United (35:59 - 36:04)
States (36:02 - 36:08)
um suspect was apprehended (36:04 - 36:12)
like this is a very silly law but uh (36:08 - 36:14)
they were apprehended by police on April (36:12 - 36:18)
9th after a police cyber Patrol (36:14 - 36:19)
discovered evidence that an individual (36:18 - 36:21)
has used special tools to illegally (36:19 - 36:24)
modifi save data for Pokemon Violet in (36:21 - 36:27)
order to change a Pokemon&#39;s move set a (36:24 - 36:29)
36 six-year-old man was arrested for (36:27 - 36:32)
selling illegally modified Pokemon uh (36:29 - 36:37)
Pokemon save data they took so they took (36:32 - 36:38)
custom (36:37 - 36:42)
orders for rare Pokemon and sold the and (36:38 - 36:44)
sold the results tampering data between (36:42 - 36:46)
December of 2022 and March of (36:44 - 36:50)
2023 uh for up to about (36:46 - 36:53)
$84 uh at a time on a website that (36:50 - 36:55)
served as a Marketplace for video game (36:53 - 36:58)
assets and items he also offered deals (36:55 - 37:01)
in which six Pokemon could be created (36:58 - 37:06)
for about uh roughly $30 so up some some (37:01 - 37:09)
Pokemon would be $84 some would be less (37:06 - 37:11)
you could get like a team of six Pokemon (37:09 - 37:12)
for like (37:11 - 37:15)
$30 (37:12 - 37:18)
um uh the suspect could face up to five (37:15 - 37:21)
years of imprisonment and or a fine up (37:18 - 37:24)
to 5 million yen which is about (37:21 - 37:24)
$32,000 uh and then of course IGN lists (37:25 - 37:31)
all their old articles about hey this is (37:29 - 37:33)
when we reported on somebody stealing (37:31 - 37:36)
Pokemon cards from a thing so there&#39;s an (37:33 - 37:38)
there&#39;s also this reminds me of another (37:36 - 37:42)
weird law that they passed when I first (37:38 - 37:44)
started streaming you could one of the (37:42 - 37:47)
best places to get a 3Ds capture card (37:44 - 37:50)
was from Japan and all it would they (37:47 - 37:53)
would just open up I think it was called (37:50 - 37:55)
I think they were called katsu Kitty so (37:53 - 37:58)
they would they would walk to a toys (37:55 - 38:02)
or uh what other big there are still (37:58 - 38:04)
Toys R Us in Japan they would walk to (38:02 - 38:06)
whatever store they would pick up a 3DS (38:04 - 38:08)
for you they would open it up they would (38:06 - 38:10)
solder a little micro (38:08 - 38:15)
USD and then they would sell it for $400 (38:10 - 38:17)
USD which how much was a 3DS when it (38:15 - 38:22)
came out 200 I think a 3DS was I think (38:17 - 38:23)
it was more than that but not too much (38:22 - 38:25)
sounds about right (38:23 - 38:29)
maybe like a I think a 2d was 199 and a (38:25 - 38:33)
3DS was 250 might have been 250 yeah (38:29 - 38:36)
yeah so a 2DS was like four I think it (38:33 - 38:37)
was like $380 (38:36 - 38:40)
$400 uh it was (38:37 - 38:42)
$249.99 at (38:40 - 38:46)
launch the 3DS the 3DS y yeah gosh it&#39;s (38:42 - 38:50)
been so long since the 3DS has existed (38:46 - 38:54)
2011 so yeah it&#39;s been a long time (38:50 - 38:56)
anyways so they would walk they would (38:54 - 38:58)
buy they would buy whatever 3DS or 2DS (38:56 - 39:00)
you wanted they would get the little (38:58 - 39:02)
Parts they would open it up they would (39:00 - 39:03)
solder it together they would test it (39:02 - 39:05)
you would buy it you would send it to (39:03 - 39:07)
them Japan passed a law that you (39:05 - 39:09)
couldn&#39;t (39:07 - 39:13)
modify Hardware so there&#39;s a they have (39:09 - 39:15)
two laws that you might be unaware of (39:13 - 39:18)
one is you can&#39;t do custom Hardware (39:15 - 39:20)
orders and the that&#39;s why Katsu Kitty (39:18 - 39:22)
shut down people thought it was like oh (39:20 - 39:25)
the Nintendo ninjas came (39:22 - 39:28)
or somebody no it was just they passed a (39:25 - 39:30)
law that like you can&#39;t then they just (39:28 - 39:35)
they shut down instantly because of that (39:30 - 39:38)
um (39:35 - 39:42)
now this guy was selling just (39:38 - 39:45)
probably very easily hackable Pokemon (39:42 - 39:49)
for 30 bucks mhm that does not stop (39:45 - 39:53)
anyone in any other country us UK If you (39:49 - 39:54)
go on (39:53 - 39:57)
eBay you can get yourself a shiny (39:54 - 39:58)
Charizard for (39:57 - 40:02)
$2.50 do I think you should do that no (39:58 - 40:04)
don&#39;t you&#39;re only encouraging bad (40:02 - 40:07)
behavior don&#39;t give those people (40:04 - 40:07)
money uh but that that is a that is a (40:08 - 40:15)
Marketplace that exists is uh selling (40:11 - 40:18)
hacked Pokemon on eBay if you&#39;ve ever (40:15 - 40:21)
gotten like a A zashi and.net or a (40:18 - 40:24)
machamps.com Pokemon traded to you from (40:21 - 40:26)
wonder trade which if you&#39;re listening (40:24 - 40:28)
to this podcast and you&#39;ve done under (40:26 - 40:30)
Trade like five times in your life youve (40:28 - 40:33)
probably gotten one of those two Pokemon (40:30 - 40:35)
that the (40:33 - 40:39)
that OT just leads you to a Facebook (40:35 - 40:42)
group and that Facebook group wants to (40:39 - 40:44)
sell you more hacked Pokemon that&#39;s all (40:42 - 40:47)
it is and really they&#39;ve gotten the (40:44 - 40:50)
science down to is it easier to trick (40:47 - 40:52)
people on eBay or is it easier to trick (40:50 - 40:54)
people on Facebook and the answer is (40:52 - 40:56)
it&#39;s easier to trick people on Facebook (40:54 - 40:58)
they know what they&#39;re doing they know (40:56 - 41:00)
their Facebook audience (40:58 - 41:02)
is oh we&#39;ll believe (41:00 - 41:05)
[Laughter] (41:02 - 41:08)
that I have run into them in my RAID my (41:05 - 41:10)
random raids (41:08 - 41:14)
now Scarlet Violet raids yep where it (41:10 - 41:20)
says name.com name yeah oh wait not like (41:14 - 41:22)
name or the Pokemon name yeah cuz I&#39;ve (41:20 - 41:23)
seen I&#39;ve SE I&#39;ve had people join my (41:22 - 41:26)
raids and they&#39;re using like a zashi (41:23 - 41:28)
it&#39;ll say like a I don&#39;t know what it (41:26 - 41:30)
would be it would be like a iron hands (41:28 - 41:32)
and it would be like zashi and.net (41:30 - 41:34)
what&#39;s funny is they&#39;re (41:32 - 41:37)
always bad bad they don&#39;t know how to do (41:34 - 41:40)
the race they&#39;re always they are always (41:37 - 41:43)
not showing they are not doing proper (41:40 - 41:44)
customer service because if you want to (41:43 - 41:46)
sell your brand and website you should (41:44 - 41:49)
be the top carrier in that and not the (41:46 - 41:51)
the thing that dies every two (41:49 - 41:54)
seconds that is my I don&#39;t know what you (41:51 - 41:56)
guys are first off stop paying money for (41:54 - 41:58)

number two is I&#39;ve never met a sashet (42:08 - 42:14)
that just didn&#39;t know how to play the (42:12 - 42:18)
video game yeah it&#39;s been (42:14 - 42:21)
bad (42:18 - 42:21)
like a nightmare (42:22 - 42:28)
situation uh hopefully look I don&#39;t (42:25 - 42:29)
think you should be selling Pokemon (42:28 - 42:31)
whether you&#39;re a a (42:29 - 42:34)
Japanese uh person or American person I (42:31 - 42:36)

years in (42:36 - 42:42)
prison for selling a $30 (42:37 - 42:45)
incinerar (42:42 - 42:45)
yeah what (42:46 - 42:52)
a I don&#39;t know fully what the 2019 (42:48 - 42:54)
unfair competition prevention Act is (42:52 - 42:56)
this whole website&#39;s in Japanese I can&#39;t (42:54 - 42:59)
read this there is a translation it&#39;s (42:56 - 43:01)
just a little hard to parse yeah at a (42:59 - 43:04)
glance at least you mean legality stuff (43:01 - 43:06)
is hard to read and understand what hey (43:04 - 43:08)
I&#39;m somewhat used to it but it&#39;s all (43:06 - 43:10)
mixed in with the Japanese every other (43:08 - 43:12)

pages and she will decide if this man (43:17 - 43:23)
should be in prison for 5 (43:20 - 43:23)
years if you need Pokémon don&#39;t pay for (43:26 - 43:31)
them there&#39;s plenty of options out there (43:29 - 43:32)
and there are plenty of trainers that (43:31 - 43:34)
have so many extra Pokemon and they&#39;re (43:32 - 43:37)

getting and then uh that will also be (44:37 - 44:45)
ReDiscover Kanto which is another Kanto (44:41 - 44:49)
event and then finally (44:45 - 44:52)
the week after or a little bit a little (44:49 - 44:53)
bit more than a week after would be (44:52 - 44:56)
ReDiscover your reality which is the (44:53 - 44:58)
changes to go (44:56 - 45:01)
A++ plus plus I don&#39;t whatever they (44:58 - 45:02)
named it now at this point just add a (45:01 - 45:05)
couple pluses and you you&#39;ll be there (45:02 - 45:08)
which I believe is the the the reason (45:05 - 45:11)
why the the current AR got changed and (45:08 - 45:12)
then this new AR you&#39;ll be able to like (45:11 - 45:14)
put three Pokemon in a picture which is (45:12 - 45:16)
like really cool for people that are (45:14 - 45:22)
into the the photo Bobby um uh I totally (45:16 - 45:26)
get this campaign though like I roll (45:22 - 45:28)
your eyes as another Kanto event me too (45:26 - 45:31)
I get it but like to redesign your (45:28 - 45:33)
character to redesign the backgrounds (45:31 - 45:35)
and then to promote Kanto Pokemon (45:33 - 45:37)
they&#39;re just trying to get new players (45:35 - 45:39)
like I I get the marketing it makes (45:37 - 45:41)
sense like what brings people back if if (45:39 - 45:43)
you were like oh I haven&#39;t played (45:41 - 45:47)
Pokemon go in six years uh it&#39;s like oh (45:43 - 45:48)
the characters are different the (45:47 - 45:50)
backgrounds are different Charizards in (45:48 - 45:53)
the game I totally get the marketing it (45:50 - 45:56)
makes sense I don&#39;t fault them for that (45:53 - 45:58)
because like that&#39;s not a Niantic issue (45:56 - 46:01)
that is just the Pokemon company as a (45:58 - 46:05)
whole relying on generation one I get it (46:01 - 46:08)
that like the Rus guy like it it doesn&#39;t (46:05 - 46:10)
bother me in the sense of like ah Kanto (46:08 - 46:13)
again it&#39;s just like I I see I I see (46:10 - 46:17)
what you&#39;re doing it bothers me I don&#39;t (46:13 - 46:19)
want more Kanto there&#39;s been yeah I&#39;m (46:17 - 46:23)
not too many Kanto events how many how (46:19 - 46:26)
many times do we have to discover Kanto (46:23 - 46:28)
before we are firmly (46:26 - 46:32)
aware that it&#39;s there and what&#39;s in it I (46:28 - 46:34)
did we none of us forgot it&#39;s the first (46:32 - 46:37)
gen we know where it is I still need (46:34 - 46:40)
another 100 tiny (46:37 - 46:44)
rattatas me the kto I need to finish (46:40 - 46:46)
that (46:44 - 46:46)
medal um no I mean like I I don&#39;t mind (46:47 - 46:54)
an event where I can go I can skip this (46:52 - 46:57)
week (46:54 - 46:57)
uh (47:00 - 47:03)
[Music] (47:01 - 47:05)
okay ReDiscover yourself express (47:03 - 47:07)
yourself like never before with a new (47:05 - 47:09)
range of Avatar customization options in (47:07 - 47:11)
Pokémon go personalize your Avatar&#39;s (47:09 - 47:14)
adjustable body weight eye color skin (47:11 - 47:16)
tones new facial expressions I don&#39;t (47:14 - 47:19)
remember those and hairstyles hairstyles (47:16 - 47:21)
can now be filtered by short medium and (47:19 - 47:24)
long you can find the perfect do for you (47:21 - 47:26)
if you included more than five then (47:24 - 47:28)
maybe yes we could get behind that a new (47:26 - 47:31)
selection that allows you to customize (47:28 - 47:34)
your Avatar&#39;s body with choices for (47:31 - 47:37)
weight muscle shoulders chest and hips (47:34 - 47:38)
they&#39;re definitely lying about the hips (47:37 - 47:40)
we&#39;ll get to that uh (47:38 - 47:43)
Advance your color options with more (47:40 - 47:47)
skin con skin tone hair and eyes oh (47:43 - 47:48)
that&#39;s what they went with like eye (47:47 - 47:50)
color yes yeah you can change your eye (47:48 - 47:51)
color (47:50 - 47:53)
MH (47:51 - 47:56)
um and then uh which is nowhere near (47:53 - 47:59)
here they decided to randomly add (47:56 - 48:01)
beltss no (47:59 - 48:04)
uh they&#39;re just new for (48:01 - 48:06)
you they&#39;ve been there for my character (48:04 - 48:08)
the whole time you just have access to (48:06 - 48:10)
them now belts and chokers have been (48:08 - 48:11)
there the entire (48:10 - 48:15)
time oh they&#39;re just weren&#39;t for the men (48:11 - 48:20)
yeah yeah that&#39;s crazy what yeah no to (48:15 - 48:22)
me wait you guys have always had belts (48:20 - 48:23)
and (48:22 - 48:26)
chokers look they have belts and chokers (48:23 - 48:29)
but we Pockets so let&#39;s decide which was (48:26 - 48:32)
more useful wait did (48:29 - 48:36)
the oh this mind blowing to be wait did (48:32 - 48:38)
the men have the male bodies have (48:36 - 48:41)
anything that the female avatars not (48:38 - 48:44)
have I don&#39;t think so just Pockets I was (48:41 - 48:47)
so I was so excited to see that we got (48:44 - 48:50)
belts I was like oh cool they added (48:47 - 48:53)
belts they finally just those are super (48:50 - 48:55)
old those are those are almost 8 years (48:53 - 48:57)
old (48:55 - 48:58)
this is (48:57 - 49:01)
[Laughter] (48:58 - 49:05)
crazy I look I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever (49:01 - 49:08)
seen a that&#39;s cuz they look bad yeah (49:05 - 49:11)
they do look bad use them but I&#39;ve never (49:08 - 49:14)
seen anyone have a choker on but you (49:11 - 49:17)
guys have always had chokers (49:14 - 49:19)
yeah that&#39;s crazy I think that&#39;s one of (49:17 - 49:20)
the first things I put on my character (49:19 - 49:22)
because it there wasn&#39;t much (49:20 - 49:23)
customization at the beginning but you (49:22 - 49:25)
could put those (49:23 - 49:29)
on wow so they&#39;re not all right well (49:25 - 49:31)
take that off the list I thought Niantic (49:29 - 49:32)
was adding something extra but I guess (49:31 - 49:34)
not I was trying to think of the (49:32 - 49:35)
positives here I was like belts and (49:34 - 49:37)
Jokers (49:35 - 49:41)
guys positives you (49:37 - 49:41)
tried (49:41 - 49:46)
um I I don&#39;t know if I want to start (49:43 - 49:50)
Greg tell me you can I have no clue what (49:46 - 49:51)
Greg thinks about this character (49:50 - 49:53)
customization thing so Greg you can (49:51 - 49:55)
start here how do you feel about (49:53 - 49:59)
rediscovering yourself (49:55 - 49:59)
have you ever just watched a (50:01 - 50:09)
person just fail spectacularly and all (50:05 - 50:11)
you could go is hey at least you tried (50:09 - 50:14)
buddy that that is that is how I felt (50:11 - 50:16)
when I went in there and I&#39;m (50:14 - 50:19)
like (50:16 - 50:22)
oh oh (50:19 - 50:25)
okay I mean thanks but every option (50:22 - 50:27)
makes me look worse (50:25 - 50:30)
like I don&#39;t know what half these (50:27 - 50:32)
sliders are supposed to do because I can (50:30 - 50:35)
see no actual change why are things (50:32 - 50:38)
clipping all the time why is okay well (50:35 - 50:39)
I&#39;m definitely not going long here (50:38 - 50:41)
because it seems to clip through (50:39 - 50:45)
everything uh and what is what is what (50:41 - 50:47)
are the what are these face types like (50:45 - 50:49)
it went from like a normal looking face (50:47 - 50:52)
to like seven options that did not look (50:49 - 50:56)
human to me and I was like um I have now (50:52 - 50:58)
gone so far into this I don&#39;t know how (50:56 - 50:59)
to get back to how I used to look at so (50:58 - 51:01)
I&#39;m just going to pick something that I (50:59 - 51:04)
don&#39;t hate and I&#39;m going to be fine with (51:01 - 51:07)
it it&#39;s not great at least it (51:04 - 51:10)
wasn&#39;t you didn&#39;t have to (51:07 - 51:15)
pay at least it was free it was (51:10 - 51:18)
free (51:15 - 51:18)
oh a (51:20 - 51:27)
Hannah I really like it um yeah I mean I (51:22 - 51:30)
was scared because everybody was having (51:27 - 51:32)
such negative reactions to it but then I (51:30 - 51:34)
went in and started messing with it and (51:32 - 51:36)
I think I am one of the people who has (51:34 - 51:39)
found that this can actually make my (51:36 - 51:41)
character look more like me I feel like (51:39 - 51:43)
my character my avatar looks more like (51:41 - 51:48)
me than it ever has um and I really like (51:43 - 51:51)
that I&#39;m also somewhat convinced that if (51:48 - 51:53)
there had just been more hairstyles and (51:51 - 51:55)
if the hairstyles had worked with all of (51:53 - 51:58)
the hats better half of the complaints (51:55 - 51:59)
would not be (51:58 - 52:02)
happening I don&#39;t think they look that (51:59 - 52:04)
bad I think most of them just look (52:02 - 52:08)
really different and the hair makes a (52:04 - 52:09)
big (52:08 - 52:12)
difference also you can&#39;t do facial hair (52:09 - 52:15)
still (52:12 - 52:19)
yeah I I have seen a very small amount (52:15 - 52:19)
of (52:19 - 52:22)
people with Hannah&#39;s perspective and and (52:19 - 52:24)
I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s wrong I think I (52:22 - 52:25)
think this goes for any character (52:24 - 52:28)
customization in any game if you can (52:25 - 52:30)
make yourself look like you then it&#39;s (52:28 - 52:32)
good and I think the problem that you&#39;re (52:30 - 52:34)
seeing is people feel like they can&#39;t (52:32 - 52:36)
make their character look like their (52:34 - 52:39)
character yeah like I and that&#39;s not to (52:36 - 52:41)
say I want to be very clear before we (52:39 - 52:43)
continue this conversation just because (52:41 - 52:45)
I am saying that this new one is bad I (52:43 - 52:48)
am not saying the old one was good (52:45 - 52:50)
that&#39;s not to be confused with that yeah (52:48 - 52:52)
it&#39;s just like when Elon Musk took over (52:50 - 52:55)
Twitter and changed it to X it was bad (52:52 - 52:58)
but that&#39;s not to say that Twitter was (52:55 - 53:00)
like a good product before that Twitter (52:58 - 53:03)
was still a negative terrible place to (53:00 - 53:05)
be it was a net negative that you made (53:03 - 53:08)
worse right like but I don&#39;t think these (53:05 - 53:10)
avatars are worse than the old ones I (53:08 - 53:12)
think I don&#39;t know I think they&#39;re (53:10 - 53:15)
different I think they are for me (53:12 - 53:17)
because I there are certain clothes that (53:15 - 53:18)
I (53:17 - 53:20)
liked and I can&#39;t wear those clothes (53:18 - 53:23)
anymore because the those clothes look (53:20 - 53:25)
bad like when you texted me Hannah with (53:23 - 53:28)
your avatar (53:25 - 53:30)
I was as as surprised learning that belt (53:28 - 53:33)
and chokers were always in the game but (53:30 - 53:35)
I was surprised that your avatar looked (53:33 - 53:38)
like you I was like holy cow yours looks (53:35 - 53:41)
like you I wish I could do that and I (53:38 - 53:44)
think that actually made me more of know (53:41 - 53:47)
that like wow yours looks good because (53:44 - 53:48)
it looks like you when I saw it I was (53:47 - 53:50)
like dang that&#39;s you and then I&#39;m like (53:48 - 53:52)
trying to like put clothes on I like or (53:50 - 53:55)
like change the muscle stuff and I&#39;m (53:52 - 53:57)
just like ah I I wish I had that (53:55 - 53:59)
experience yeah and maybe that&#39;s the (53:57 - 54:01)
frustration other people are having is (53:59 - 54:04)
like gosh I just wish I could get it to (54:01 - 54:08)
a point where I&#39;m like okay with it yeah (54:04 - 54:09)
I mean that was my experience where I (54:08 - 54:12)
was just like I I am clicking through (54:09 - 54:13)
these body types They (54:12 - 54:18)
Don&#39;t Really they they all look they all (54:13 - 54:20)
look a little weird on each head like (54:18 - 54:22)
the heads aren&#39;t really matching the (54:20 - 54:24)
body size and I&#39;m having troubles like (54:22 - 54:29)
getting that to match right and like I I (54:24 - 54:31)
I can&#39;t get that to go and then I&#39;m (54:29 - 54:33)
using these sliders and like from the (54:31 - 54:35)
front I can see nothing I turn it to the (54:33 - 54:36)
side and I can sort of maybe see that (54:35 - 54:40)
there&#39;s a change but like I I I every (54:36 - 54:43)
time I change something I&#39;m like I&#39;m (54:40 - 54:47)
getting I I&#39;m getting further away from (54:43 - 54:47)
the (54:47 - 54:50)
familiar and I now can&#39;t even go back to (54:47 - 54:51)
the familiar because I don&#39;t even know (54:50 - 54:54)
where I was that I started there so I&#39;m (54:51 - 54:55)
just going to pick something that I (54:54 - 54:57)
guess (54:55 - 55:01)
is fine but it&#39;s (54:57 - 55:05)
not me and that was sort of the point (55:01 - 55:07)
like I can&#39;t put facial hair on I can&#39;t (55:05 - 55:10)
change those things I I can sort of (55:07 - 55:12)
maybe get my body shape but my head is (55:10 - 55:14)
not the right proportion to the body (55:12 - 55:18)
that I&#39;m making because I really can&#39;t (55:14 - 55:19)
adjust that I going through the faces (55:18 - 55:21)
and they just they get smaller and (55:19 - 55:23)
weirder and rounder and I can&#39;t really (55:21 - 55:28)
control that so it&#39;s like (55:23 - 55:30)
I can&#39;t fault a free thing I can&#39;t fault (55:28 - 55:36)
them for trying to do something but it (55:30 - 55:36)
felt it felt Half Baked to me like well (55:37 - 55:45)
we&#39;ll get a certain amount of people but (55:41 - 55:48)
not a lot of them and those who get it (55:45 - 55:50)
will love it but those who don&#39;t have it (55:48 - 55:52)
are going to be like why are all these (55:50 - 55:54)
things bad and why is why can&#39;t I have (55:52 - 55:56)
long hair that doesn&#39;t clip through my (55:54 - 55:58)
shoulders and what doesn&#39;t clip through (55:56 - 56:00)
these to these hats like these are (55:58 - 56:04)
fairly like to be fair that is a huge (56:00 - 56:05)
problem in a lot of them like Final (56:04 - 56:07)
Fantasy hair clips through everything (56:05 - 56:10)
and it is a major complaint in that game (56:07 - 56:12)
all the time and my character being a (56:10 - 56:15)
cat Dad can&#39;t even wear hats I&#39;m not (56:12 - 56:18)
allowed to wear hats I&#39;m forbidden from (56:15 - 56:21)
wearing hats so like this is a common (56:18 - 56:24)
problem and I know that is a huge issue (56:21 - 56:27)
but these don&#39;t feel (56:24 - 56:30)
complex enough to have that much in the (56:27 - 56:32)
way (56:30 - 56:37)
of clipping they don&#39;t do a (56:32 - 56:37)
lot (56:40 - 56:45)
um yeah I I think the clipping also (56:42 - 56:49)
bothered me a lot um like my my the the (56:45 - 56:52)
the Hat default that I go back to is (56:49 - 56:54)
like the Sylveon headband um it&#39;s just (56:52 - 56:56)
like my favorite headband I thought it (56:54 - 56:57)
like looked the best it is different (56:56 - 56:59)
than the other headbands like how it (56:57 - 57:02)
sits on your on your head (56:59 - 57:04)
and first off like the amount of (57:02 - 57:07)
hairstyles is so incredibly limited I (57:04 - 57:10)
was shocked of like yeah the hairstyles (57:07 - 57:15)
are bad like this like we only have like (57:10 - 57:18)
there&#39;s only what like nine (57:15 - 57:22)
there&#39;s a and and I think two or three (57:18 - 57:24)
of them are like designed for people of (57:22 - 57:26)
color which is like totally cool but (57:24 - 57:28)
like as a white dude I don&#39;t need to be (57:26 - 57:33)
rocking like a a a a fade sit sick fade (57:28 - 57:35)
top I don&#39;t know what that hairstyles C (57:33 - 57:37)
I&#39;m so sorry but like that&#39;s not like a (57:35 - 57:39)
white person haircut so like that that (57:37 - 57:41)
is already out the bat I don&#39;t have long (57:39 - 57:43)
hair so that elimates that so really (57:41 - 57:45)
there&#39;s only like two haircuts I can (57:43 - 57:46)
wear and one of them is the the original (57:45 - 57:51)
starting haircut which is fine but it no (57:46 - 57:55)
longer the the the the Sylveon headband (57:51 - 57:56)
no longer looks like it used to look (57:55 - 57:58)
look it it just looks bad now when I put (57:56 - 57:59)
it on so I can&#39;t even wear the Sylveon (57:58 - 58:00)
headband without being like oh this (57:59 - 58:03)
looks terrible um so like the lack of (58:00 - 58:06)
hairstyles was like really (58:03 - 58:09)
weird because you&#39;re you can&#39;t change (58:06 - 58:12)
the head and I think Greg is right and (58:09 - 58:13)
that&#39;s why the body stuff is kind of (58:12 - 58:15)
weird cuz your head doesn&#39;t change so if (58:13 - 58:17)
you like make yourself more muscular (58:15 - 58:19)
your head looks (58:17 - 58:22)
tinier so it&#39;s (58:19 - 58:25)
like why would there just not be more (58:22 - 58:28)
hairstyle (58:25 - 58:28)
there&#39;s just not a lot (58:29 - 58:33)
um (58:31 - 58:36)
so there are more hair colors and there (58:33 - 58:41)
are eye colors now and that&#39;s good and (58:36 - 58:43)
they must have changed something with (58:41 - 58:46)
the shading engine because I I feel like (58:43 - 58:49)
the more I sat with this Avatar update (58:46 - 58:52)
the more angry I (58:49 - 58:55)
got and the more I like looked on Reddit (58:52 - 58:57)
and Twitter and in our Discord and our (58:55 - 58:59)
slack and talking PE through people with (58:57 - 59:03)
twitch and comparing old and new like (58:59 - 59:05)
the shading is just different and I (59:03 - 59:07)
think that&#39;s what makes like the B like (59:05 - 59:09)
just looking at your character weird (59:07 - 59:10)
like there&#39;s not (59:09 - 59:13)
this stylized shading that the old (59:10 - 59:16)
system had but also like things are not (59:13 - 59:18)
as colorful anymore like everything&#39;s (59:16 - 59:21)
like slightly more muted like the the (59:18 - 59:24)
white skin tone looks like you&#39;re a (59:21 - 59:27)
ghost and there are more skin tones but (59:24 - 59:30)
like none of (59:27 - 59:33)
them like it just (59:30 - 59:36)
it Monster Hunter did this Monster (59:33 - 59:39)
Hunter 4 ultimate I think where you (59:36 - 59:42)
would pick a skin tone in the Character (59:39 - 59:44)
Creator and then you would go into the (59:42 - 59:47)
game and it would look totally different (59:44 - 59:49)
because the lighting in the game was (59:47 - 59:50)
different than the lighting in the (59:49 - 59:52)
Character Creator and that&#39;s how I&#39;m (59:50 - 59:56)
feeling here where like in the opt when (59:52 - 59:58)
I&#39;m looking at the colors the little (59:56 - 60:01)
circles I&#39;m like that is my skin cone (59:58 - 60:03)
and I click it and then my character (60:01 - 60:06)
looks like they died like they are pale (60:03 - 60:08)
white and I&#39;m like but that&#39;s not that&#39;s (60:06 - 60:10)
not the color that you&#39;re showing in the (60:08 - 60:13)
little circle thingy like I guess I (60:10 - 60:16)
could go darker but that Circle doesn&#39;t (60:13 - 60:18)
seem to be the one I think it&#39;s a (60:16 - 60:21)
lighting issue though which Pokemon (60:18 - 60:23)
games Play Scarlet Violet if you would (60:21 - 60:25)
like to look at lighting isues no thank (60:23 - 60:28)
you (60:25 - 60:28)
um it does like I I guess I&#39;m just so (60:30 - 60:36)
dumbfounded (60:33 - 60:39)
how that I can&#39;t imagine one person (60:36 - 60:43)
worked on this right like it like how (60:39 - 60:46)
does a group of people work on this and (60:43 - 60:49)
then another group of people go yes (60:46 - 60:52)
let&#39;s push that through like it feels (60:49 - 60:54)
like a good start like I think the (60:52 - 60:57)
sliders are great the adding more (60:54 - 61:01)
hairstyles is great changing eye color (60:57 - 61:04)
weight muscle surprised there&#39;s no (61:01 - 61:08)
height but like I think it&#39;s such a good (61:04 - 61:11)
start and more options are better but it (61:08 - 61:12)
just felt (61:11 - 61:16)
like how did so many people go like this (61:12 - 61:20)
is prime time this is ready like it (61:16 - 61:22)
just it feels (61:20 - 61:27)
like I mean that&#39;s istic features yeah (61:22 - 61:30)
know we&#39;re showing and it&#39;s going to be (61:27 - 61:32)
ready in a month or two we we&#39;re just (61:30 - 61:34)
still we&#39;re still tweaking it we need (61:32 - 61:36)
some feedback what happened to the (61:34 - 61:38)
feedback yeah they rolled this out to (61:36 - 61:40)
characters a month like Bobby had this (61:38 - 61:43)
like a month ago and there what happened (61:40 - 61:46)
to that feedback were did they not trust (61:43 - 61:48)
that feedback did they not did they not (61:46 - 61:50)
have time to implement that feedback (61:48 - 61:53)
like I don&#39;t think I mean it it feels (61:50 - 61:55)
like a rush deadline to me in a lot of (61:53 - 61:59)
ways and feels like I it it could very (61:55 - 62:01)
well be that a lot of the feedback was (61:59 - 62:04)
negative and they&#39;re just like well we (62:01 - 62:07)
are in no way going to be able to make (62:04 - 62:08)
all of those (62:07 - 62:11)
changes when the deadline we have stated (62:08 - 62:12)
is going to happen so we are just going (62:11 - 62:15)
to push it out and apologize later which (62:12 - 62:17)
is exactly what they (62:15 - 62:19)
done (62:17 - 62:22)
um (62:19 - 62:22)
it it&#39;s hard like it&#39;s hard to sort of (62:23 - 62:29)
Judge what is the better course of (62:27 - 62:31)
action pushing something out that gets a (62:29 - 62:33)
negative response and then doing the pr (62:31 - 62:37)
of fixing it or pushing something out (62:33 - 62:39)
that&#39;s Flawless from the beginning like (62:37 - 62:42)
I don&#39;t know which has a (62:39 - 62:45)
bigger weight to it like that I think (62:42 - 62:48)
that&#39;s very hard to determine um because (62:45 - 62:51)
I think like to Hannah&#39;s sake there are (62:48 - 62:54)
a lot of people who had a very positive (62:51 - 62:57)
experience with it and I think they were (62:54 - 62:59)
expecting that to be over the halfway (62:57 - 63:02)
mark and I do not think it&#39;s there I (62:59 - 63:04)
think if you have a very specif like if (63:02 - 63:06)
you have very specific things that you (63:04 - 63:08)
can recreate in there that are easy and (63:06 - 63:10)
they don&#39;t cause the problems it comes (63:08 - 63:12)
out brilliant but I think that&#39;s a much (63:10 - 63:14)
smaller percentage of people than they (63:12 - 63:15)
were (63:14 - 63:18)
hoping also people who are angrier are (63:15 - 63:20)
louder that&#39;s always a thing to take (63:18 - 63:23)
into account yes the people who are (63:20 - 63:24)
pretty satisfied with this I think are a (63:23 - 63:27)
lot quieter that&#39;s I know yeah I know (63:24 - 63:30)
that it&#39;s not just me oh yeah but I know (63:27 - 63:32)
there are issues I know they don&#39;t look (63:30 - 63:35)
amazing I think a lot of it&#39;s that (63:32 - 63:37)
they&#39;re just different but there are (63:35 - 63:39)
some (63:37 - 63:39)
issues I wouldn&#39;t say some I would say (63:39 - 63:42)
there&#39;s a (63:41 - 63:45)
lot I would say there are three things (63:42 - 63:47)
they could do to make a lot of people (63:45 - 63:50)
happier they could make more hairstyles (63:47 - 63:52)
and make the hairstyles clip less so (63:50 - 63:55)
they could fix the hair they could make (63:52 - 63:57)
the head a just proportionally with the (63:55 - 64:00)
body and they could add a waist slider (63:57 - 64:02)
and I think that those three (64:00 - 64:05)
things would make a lot of people much (64:02 - 64:06)
happier with this (64:05 - 64:08)
update I would add a fourth which is (64:06 - 64:10)
like the lighting because everything (64:08 - 64:13)
does seem duller like I saw a side I (64:10 - 64:16)
I&#39;ve seen side by sides of just shirts (64:13 - 64:19)
and they they just look muted yeah and (64:16 - 64:21)
that kind of sucks and that especially (64:19 - 64:24)
sucks if you spent money on the game (64:21 - 64:26)
yeah like oh I bought this original (64:24 - 64:29)
Stitch ladyb (64:26 - 64:32)
shirt because it was bright and red and (64:29 - 64:34)
colorful and in the new one it doesn&#39;t (64:32 - 64:38)
look good at all it looks bad I didn&#39;t (64:34 - 64:40)
buy that shirt for the record but like (64:38 - 64:42)
seeing that side by side I mean I felt (64:40 - 64:44)
that way with like the Sylveon headband (64:42 - 64:46)
what was it like a 100 poke coins a (64:44 - 64:48)
dollar and I literally can&#39;t wear it (64:46 - 64:49)
right now it just looks (64:48 - 64:52)
terrible and it&#39;s weird because the more (64:49 - 64:53)
I customize (64:52 - 64:56)
things uh or like put clothes on that I (64:53 - 65:00)
had they did address some (64:56 - 65:04)
clipping like if you like the I never (65:00 - 65:09)
bought the um the chain wallet (65:04 - 65:11)
jeans it&#39;s it&#39;s the jeans with the chain (65:09 - 65:14)
wallet attached and I was excited when (65:11 - 65:15)
they announced it and I never bought it (65:14 - 65:18)
because it clipped with a bunch of stuff (65:15 - 65:21)
and you can try it on so I tried it on (65:18 - 65:22)
to see if they fix the clipping and they (65:21 - 65:24)
did with that specific item if you put (65:22 - 65:27)
boots on the jeans will actually tuck (65:24 - 65:30)
into the boots and if you put shoes on (65:27 - 65:35)
it will go over so they did look at that (65:30 - 65:38)
to an extent but then there are other (65:35 - 65:41)
items that just completely clip through (65:38 - 65:43)
or or don&#39;t work (65:41 - 65:46)
or like when I put the sil like the (65:43 - 65:47)
screenshot I post on Twitter where I put (65:46 - 65:49)
the Sylveon headband on and like the (65:47 - 65:52)
hair just like frizzled out it just (65:49 - 65:54)
exploded on my character&#39;s head and it (65:52 - 65:58)
was like there&#39;s only like nine haircuts (65:54 - 66:01)
there&#39;s not a lot how did you guys not (65:58 - 66:04)
see this yeah although I will say there (66:01 - 66:06)
is at least one item that I have seen (66:04 - 66:08)
someone complaining that their arms are (66:06 - 66:10)
clipping through it no that was just the (66:08 - 66:13)
female top style that&#39;s supposed to look (66:10 - 66:16)
that way oh like the like the shoulders (66:13 - 66:18)
are one (66:16 - 66:21)
yeah yeah so the some of it is that (66:18 - 66:22)
people just aren&#39;t used to these (66:21 - 66:25)
clothing items at least a little bit and (66:22 - 66:27)
I do think think they fixed some of the (66:25 - 66:28)
clipping with the pants and the shoes I (66:27 - 66:31)
tested out a lot of the pants and shoes (66:28 - 66:34)
that I had had issues with and I do (66:31 - 66:35)
think there&#39;s less (66:34 - 66:38)
there yeah but clearly this was an (66:35 - 66:40)
update that they had planned to happen (66:38 - 66:44)
with this event and when an update is (66:40 - 66:47)
planned to happen with a scheduled (66:44 - 66:50)
event it&#39;s going to happen which is (66:47 - 66:52)
which is crazy cu the the the next thing (66:50 - 66:55)
that&#39;s coming is the new backgrounds and (66:52 - 67:00)
they look so good they look fantastic (66:55 - 67:02)
and I haven&#39;t seen like like when when (67:00 - 67:03)
some people were getting the new (67:02 - 67:06)
character updates like I remember I (67:03 - 67:08)
remember zoe2 dos got it and I looked at (67:06 - 67:10)
her character and I was like like why (67:08 - 67:12)
does it look so bad and then when I&#39;ve (67:10 - 67:14)
seen screenshots of the new backgrounds (67:12 - 67:17)
I&#39;m like dang these look so good like (67:14 - 67:18)
the the city background the beach (67:17 - 67:20)
background they look (67:18 - 67:23)
fantastic how did the same company do (67:20 - 67:24)
both of (67:23 - 67:27)
these how (67:24 - 67:29)
someone can be really good at drawing (67:27 - 67:31)
characters or someone can be really good (67:29 - 67:32)
at drawing backgrounds but the same (67:31 - 67:35)
artist can&#39;t always do both right right (67:32 - 67:36)
right but like there has to be somebody (67:35 - 67:39)
above them that approves it and for them (67:36 - 67:41)
to be like yes like the background&#39;s (67:39 - 67:43)
good to go and then this (67:41 - 67:46)
character maybe they did think more (67:43 - 67:50)
people were going to like this than not (67:46 - 67:53)
but the last I feel I feel like when I (67:50 - 67:56)
think of big issues in Pokemon go (67:53 - 67:57)
which there&#39;s always like something (67:56 - 67:59)
wrong with Pokemon go right which is (67:57 - 68:02)
fine whatever but when you actually like (67:59 - 68:04)
look back in the last seven years of big (68:02 - 68:06)
issues you think (68:04 - 68:09)
about the remote raid pass (68:06 - 68:12)
stuff which that was a that (68:09 - 68:18)
was a price increase and a item (68:12 - 68:21)
limit and I I think even if it didn&#39;t (68:18 - 68:23)
have an item limit cuz you&#39;re only (68:21 - 68:26)
allowed to do five a day you would still (68:23 - 68:29)
have the same backlash of the price (68:26 - 68:32)
increase uh which is from a dollar to I (68:29 - 68:34)
think what what is aot rate (68:32 - 68:37)
P90 they should like 10 cents cheaper (68:34 - 68:38)
than (68:37 - 68:41)
$2 but in that (68:38 - 68:43)
instance that (68:41 - 68:47)
was not the majority of the player base (68:43 - 68:51)
that was a very active player base that (68:47 - 68:57)
spent a lot of money every day like I am (68:51 - 68:58)
I am just shy of hitting level 50 in (68:57 - 69:00)
Pokemon go the only reason I haven&#39;t (68:58 - 69:02)
level hit Level 50 yet is because I want (69:00 - 69:04)
to do it in Japan and I&#39;m going to Japan (69:02 - 69:07)
in like a month so could have been 50 a (69:04 - 69:11)
little bit earlier but I&#39;m I probably (69:07 - 69:14)
give Pokemon go $15 to $20 a month on (69:11 - 69:18)
average just based off what I buy or (69:14 - 69:19)
what I (69:18 - 69:23)
upgrade I would argue that most people (69:19 - 69:25)
that are Level 50 are probably hardcore (69:23 - 69:26)
players it&#39;s very hard to get to 50 (69:25 - 69:28)
without spending money without playing a (69:26 - 69:31)
lot there I talk about it all the time (69:28 - 69:33)
if you just jump into a raid at like (69:31 - 69:36)
Mall of America or at a community day (69:33 - 69:38)
just look at how many people are not (69:36 - 69:41)
even level 40 yet and this game has been (69:38 - 69:43)
out for almost eight years (69:41 - 69:46)
like some people just play on commun (69:43 - 69:47)
days some people just play on the (69:46 - 69:48)
weekends some people just log in catch (69:47 - 69:51)
one Pokemon don&#39;t play again (69:48 - 69:52)
right (69:51 - 69:56)
so as a hardcore player I was only doing (69:52 - 69:58)
like (69:56 - 70:00)
three maybe three remote raids a week (69:58 - 70:03)
before the price increase like I just (70:00 - 70:05)
wasn&#39;t remote raing that much cuz I (70:03 - 70:07)
didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t care like I didn&#39;t want (70:05 - 70:10)
to give the money I didn&#39;t need to get (70:07 - 70:12)
another tapu bulu I already got the (70:10 - 70:14)
shiny a while ago I don&#39;t need to do (70:12 - 70:18)
anymore like if it was free I&#39;d do it um (70:14 - 70:21)
so like I&#39;m not invalidating those (70:18 - 70:24)
people for the remote raid price (70:21 - 70:27)
increase I get why they were upset that (70:24 - 70:29)
was their favorite part of the game if (70:27 - 70:31)
they wanted to do 20 remote raids in a (70:29 - 70:33)
day that&#39;s $20 a day that some people (70:31 - 70:36)
were doing I get it I don&#39;t have that (70:33 - 70:37)
kind of money that&#39;s not how I want to (70:36 - 70:40)
play the game but if that is what you (70:37 - 70:43)
enjoyed those people were very very (70:40 - 70:47)
vocal right and then the issue before (70:43 - 70:48)
that (70:47 - 70:52)
was um the raid the the the Poké stop (70:48 - 70:54)
distance I feel like that was the other (70:52 - 70:56)
big big issue yeah (70:54 - 70:57)
n (70:56 - 70:59)
Antics (70:57 - 71:03)
and Niantic went back on that they (70:59 - 71:07)
made they changed it for the pandemic (71:03 - 71:11)
they then changed it back people (71:07 - 71:14)
complained and they they reverted it and (71:11 - 71:17)
then before that or maybe around the (71:14 - 71:18)
same time was the Mega stuff the mega (71:17 - 71:21)
stuff was pretty bad and terrible and (71:18 - 71:25)
they revamped the entire thing and that (71:21 - 71:28)
was maybe the most positive I&#39;ve ever (71:25 - 71:31)
seen Pokemon players on social media was (71:28 - 71:33)
like oh my gosh the new Mega stuff is (71:31 - 71:36)
really great again that&#39;s the hardcore (71:33 - 71:39)
players though most was hardore most (71:36 - 71:42)
people I know still don&#39;t Mega almost (71:39 - 71:45)
anything 100% yeah (71:42 - 71:48)
you&#39;re (71:45 - 71:52)
um but and I&#39;m try I&#39;m trably what was (71:48 - 71:54)
another big issue those are probably the (71:52 - 71:57)
top three that I remember megas the Poké (71:54 - 72:00)
stop distance raid (71:57 - 72:02)
passes those are definitely the ones (72:00 - 72:05)
where people have been the most vocal MH (72:02 - 72:09)
yeah and this I feel (72:05 - 72:12)
like is in the top three like (72:09 - 72:14)
something&#39;s getting bumped out but (72:12 - 72:16)
people are vocal for different reasons (72:14 - 72:19)
on this there&#39;s a lot of toxicity coming (72:16 - 72:21)
out with the vocalness on this update (72:19 - 72:26)
alongside all of the other feedback (72:21 - 72:29)
uh yeah I yes there there (72:26 - 72:32)
are definitely people being negative in (72:29 - 72:36)
the wrong ways for (72:32 - 72:38)
sure but I (72:36 - 72:43)
I I think that like when (72:38 - 72:43)
you when you cannot look like yourself (72:44 - 72:50)
or where you feel like that character (72:47 - 72:53)
doesn&#39;t represent you I feel like that&#39;s (72:50 - 72:57)
a real easy way to walk away from a (72:53 - 72:59)
game and this this has nothing to do (72:57 - 73:01)
with money right like when you bring up (72:59 - 73:03)
the mega stuff that was technically (73:01 - 73:04)
money technically (73:03 - 73:07)
raids when you bring up the the remote (73:04 - 73:11)
raid pass increase again money raids (73:07 - 73:13)
like logging in for Community Day or (73:11 - 73:15)
going out or just checking the game (73:13 - 73:16)
every day and then looking at a (73:15 - 73:18)
character that you&#39;re not happy with is (73:16 - 73:20)
a really easy way to push you away from (73:18 - 73:23)
a game I think so I I do actually think (73:20 - 73:26)
this is a more serious issue (73:23 - 73:29)
than the other some of the other issues (73:26 - 73:31)
that Niantic has (73:29 - 73:34)
done I don&#39;t disagree but I also don&#39;t (73:31 - 73:35)
think (73:34 - 73:40)
that uh fewer people can look like their (73:35 - 73:43)
avatars than they previously did I think (73:40 - 73:45)
that the sudden (73:43 - 73:48)
change is tricky but I think that the (73:45 - 73:51)
old avatars also weren&#39;t characters that (73:48 - 73:55)
people could look like a lot of the time (73:51 - 73:57)
I think sort of the (73:55 - 74:01)
difference is the old avatars weren&#39;t (73:57 - 74:04)
presented as a very customizable (74:01 - 74:06)
experience it&#39;s it&#39;s much like when you (74:04 - 74:09)
would play old Pokemon games and you got (74:06 - 74:12)
what the default thing was right like (74:09 - 74:14)
that was the experience going into to go (74:12 - 74:16)
and there wasn&#39;t a sense or it being (74:14 - 74:20)
sold as make yourself look like you and (74:16 - 74:22)
when they add something that is supposed (74:20 - 74:23)
to change that (74:22 - 74:26)
Dynamic that is going to hit hard harder (74:23 - 74:29)
than you only have these choices and (74:26 - 74:31)
these choices are Universal for (74:29 - 74:33)
everybody they don&#39;t look like anybody (74:31 - 74:36)
that&#39;s a different messaging and a (74:33 - 74:39)
different emotional experience than you (74:36 - 74:40)
can make (74:39 - 74:44)
yourself spoiler no you can&#39;t and if you (74:40 - 74:47)
can&#39;t even get close for some people um (74:44 - 74:50)
and I think that (74:47 - 74:53)
is I think to Steve&#39;s point (74:50 - 74:56)
that that messaging (74:53 - 74:58)
that underlines that (74:56 - 75:02)
disconnect hurts a (74:58 - 75:02)
lot yeah I think of I think of Final (75:03 - 75:08)
Fantasy 14 and I don&#39;t know if Greg can (75:06 - 75:10)
relate to me in this but when I played (75:08 - 75:12)
Final Fantasy 14 and I have 3,000 hours (75:10 - 75:16)
in Final Fantasy 14 um and I I I stopped (75:12 - 75:19)
playing completely but of those 3,000 (75:16 - 75:21)
hours I played as a lell which is like a (75:19 - 75:23)
little he like a little potato that you (75:21 - 75:25)
run around the map very cute I love my (75:23 - 75:30)
lell and a lell does not look like me (75:25 - 75:32)
right just want to be very clear if (75:30 - 75:34)
you&#39;re watching the video version I do (75:32 - 75:36)
not look like a (75:34 - 75:40)
lell uh but I loved my lell I loved the (75:36 - 75:43)
way I made him look I loved the clothes (75:40 - 75:46)
I put on him I loved that little wand he (75:43 - 75:48)
carried and I made like a bet with (75:46 - 75:51)
somebody over something it was just like (75:48 - 75:54)
a harmless bet of like whatever I lost (75:51 - 75:57)
the bet right right and so the my my (75:54 - 75:59)
penalty was like I had to change to a (75:57 - 76:02)
different character very harmless no big (75:59 - 76:04)
deal in Final Fantasy 14 there&#39;s a thing (76:02 - 76:06)
called Fantasia it&#39;s like 10 bucks you (76:04 - 76:07)
change your character and they were (76:06 - 76:09)
already introducing a new character they (76:07 - 76:12)
were introducing the um I think the cat (76:09 - 76:15)
people at the time they it was it was (76:12 - 76:16)
like right after they introduced the (76:15 - 76:18)
lizard people it was like because I (76:16 - 76:20)
think Greg&#39;s a cat person I have a cat (76:18 - 76:22)
Dad yes yeah so it was around the time (76:20 - 76:24)
of the cat person and I was going to (76:22 - 76:27)
change to that anyways uh but I decided (76:24 - 76:29)
like last minute I wanted to change to (76:27 - 76:30)
something else I don&#39;t even remember (76:29 - 76:32)
what it changed to it was like the the (76:30 - 76:33)
Elf character or something or maybe it (76:32 - 76:35)
was a cat person with a tail I don&#39;t (76:33 - 76:38)
remember but I changed that character (76:35 - 76:41)
and for the first like hour I was like (76:38 - 76:43)
ah this is cool like somebody different (76:41 - 76:45)
and then the more I played it the more I (76:43 - 76:47)
disliked it and I desperately tried to (76:45 - 76:50)
find new clothes and I went back into (76:47 - 76:52)
character creator to like maybe change (76:50 - 76:54)
the hair or the eyes and I was just (76:52 - 76:56)
getting frustrated cuz I there was (76:54 - 76:58)
nothing that I really liked now again I (76:56 - 77:00)
don&#39;t look like a lell I also don&#39;t look (76:58 - 77:03)
like a cat person but the there was like (77:00 - 77:05)
a separation of like this doesn&#39;t feel (77:03 - 77:09)
like me and because of that that is (77:05 - 77:11)
actually when I stopped playing Final (77:09 - 77:13)
Fantasy I sto I stopped logging in every (77:11 - 77:16)
day when I did log in I would (77:13 - 77:18)
immediately go into Character Creator (77:16 - 77:20)
and try to like change something to make (77:18 - 77:22)
it better now the the people are like (77:20 - 77:24)
Steve why didn&#39;t you just change back (77:22 - 77:27)
this was over like a week period And I (77:24 - 77:29)
was going to change back I was just like (77:27 - 77:31)
oh there&#39;s going to be a sale in spring (77:29 - 77:34)
for Fantasia Fantasia is normally $10 it (77:31 - 77:36)
usually goes on sale for six I&#39;ll just (77:34 - 77:37)
wait like two more weeks it&#39;ll be fine (77:36 - 77:40)
I&#39;ll get the Fantasia then and I (77:37 - 77:42)
couldn&#39;t I didn&#39;t make it that long and (77:40 - 77:43)
I went from logging in every day to (77:42 - 77:46)
logging in every other day to like oh (77:43 - 77:48)
Fantasia&#39;s on sale oh I didn&#39;t even log (77:46 - 77:49)
in I missed it and then I stopped (77:48 - 77:51)
playing and I think that&#39;s a very (77:49 - 77:54)
relatable experience to people who would (77:51 - 77:56)
be playing go (77:54 - 77:57)
because that&#39;s a free game like the (77:56 - 77:59)
barrier to entry for Final Fantasy A (77:57 - 78:01)
little bit higher you got to pay $15 a (77:59 - 78:03)
month and I&#39;m not I guess the point I&#39;m (78:01 - 78:05)
making is the character doesn&#39;t (78:03 - 78:08)
necessarily have to look like you you (78:05 - 78:10)
just have to relate to it in a way and (78:08 - 78:13)
it&#39;s interesting because Final Fantasy (78:10 - 78:14)
has spent the (78:13 - 78:17)
last year and a (78:14 - 78:19)
half because they are (78:17 - 78:22)
updating all of the character models and (78:19 - 78:27)
they have spent a year and a half trying (78:22 - 78:31)
to get it right like there is so much (78:27 - 78:33)
like that game understands how much you (78:31 - 78:35)
identify with your character and they (78:33 - 78:37)
have been putting out preview after (78:35 - 78:40)
preview after preview to say here&#39;s (78:37 - 78:42)
where we are here&#39;s where it&#39;s going and (78:40 - 78:44)
getting that feedback because they (78:42 - 78:46)
fundamentally understand how important (78:44 - 78:49)
it is that you have that connection with (78:46 - 78:52)
that character like people like I are (78:49 - 78:55)
going to change you know cuz you know (78:52 - 78:59)
ladies are coming um and I&#39;m like nope I (78:55 - 79:02)
am very happy with my cat Dad I can&#39;t (78:59 - 79:05)
wear hats is the only bummer about it (79:02 - 79:08)
like there Justice for your hats yeah (79:05 - 79:10)
just I can wear glasses which is fine I (79:08 - 79:13)
wear my glasses uh and I can also wear (79:10 - 79:14)
full helmets I cover my head but I don&#39;t (79:13 - 79:16)
like that because I like seeing my head (79:14 - 79:19)
but like when they did male bunnies I (79:16 - 79:22)
was like oh I like theier of the race (79:19 - 79:24)
but like they were all they all looked (79:22 - 79:27)
depressed they all look like sad boys (79:24 - 79:30)
and I was like nope this isn&#39;t for me I (79:27 - 79:32)
don&#39;t want to play a sad boy bunny oh I (79:30 - 79:34)
think I was originally going to change (79:32 - 79:35)
to the bunny I forgot all about that (79:34 - 79:36)
maybe it wasn&#39;t the cat maybe it was the (79:35 - 79:39)
bunny it&#39;s probably the bunny sad boy (79:36 - 79:41)
bunnies uh well cuz it was bunny girls (79:39 - 79:43)
sad boy bunnies came because it&#39;s only (79:41 - 79:45)
it was bunny girls and Cat dads during (79:43 - 79:49)
that release they finally released boy (79:45 - 79:51)
bunnies and now they&#39;re finally (79:49 - 79:55)
releasing girl cats cats which I just (79:51 - 79:57)
called the lesbians cuz they all look (79:55 - 80:00)
like lesbians to me and I love it and (79:57 - 80:02)
there should be more more of them in (80:00 - 80:07)
there but they are the thing about what (80:02 - 80:10)
they understand is like it has it is (80:07 - 80:13)
going to be literally two years when the (80:10 - 80:15)
expansion comes out and all the new (80:13 - 80:18)
faces are that is how much work they put (80:15 - 80:22)
into make sure that with a graphical (80:18 - 80:24)
update you go and look at your character (80:22 - 80:27)
and you think think I still am myself I (80:24 - 80:31)
just look refreshed and that did not (80:27 - 80:33)
happen here this one is very much I (80:31 - 80:35)
don&#39;t look like (80:33 - 80:38)
myself and now I&#39;m in a world where (80:35 - 80:40)
people people are able to look like (80:38 - 80:44)
themselves and I can&#39;t even get close (80:40 - 80:47)
and that&#39;s a huge (80:44 - 80:49)
problem also I don&#39;t think people would (80:47 - 80:53)
be as mad if this came out a year after (80:49 - 80:56)
go debuted not seven (80:53 - 80:59)
after like we waited so for (80:56 - 81:02)
this and it it fell flat for (80:59 - 81:06)
people um now (81:02 - 81:09)
Niantic is aware of the backlash this is (81:06 - 81:10)
off (81:09 - 81:14)
Esports uh after facing backlash of the (81:10 - 81:16)
new Avatar update in Pokemon go Niantic (81:14 - 81:18)
confirmed that it is aware on how the (81:16 - 81:19)
community feels and is taking feedback (81:18 - 81:21)
regardless of the (81:19 - 81:26)
changes um the update came on April 17th (81:21 - 81:28)
uh less than two days later Niantic has (81:26 - 81:31)
acknowledged that a very vocal dismay of (81:28 - 81:34)
its players base uh is reaching out to (81:31 - 81:35)
ask for feed they are reaching out to (81:34 - 81:37)
ask for feedback on Avatar changes which (81:35 - 81:38)
is being compiled for the team that (81:37 - 81:40)
works on Pokemon go we are sending all (81:38 - 81:42)
your feedback to the product team and (81:40 - 81:43)
the folks who worked on the Avatar (81:42 - 81:45)
system we&#39;re taking this very seriously (81:43 - 81:47)
and we really appreciate you sharing (81:45 - 81:49)
your candid personal opinions (81:47 - 81:56)
um n Niantic said to the Pokemon go hub (81:49 - 81:56)
um look I said I said on the show uh (81:56 - 82:02)
that I was in a meeting with (82:00 - 82:05)
Niantic two plus years ago I I wasn&#39;t (82:02 - 82:07)
even living in this (82:05 - 82:10)
house it was a different house and they (82:07 - 82:14)
asked us what feedback we had or they (82:10 - 82:17)
were like if we were to do an avatar (82:14 - 82:19)
revamp what would you like to see and a (82:17 - 82:21)
lot of the things are there you know it (82:19 - 82:24)
was it was let us wear anybody&#39;s clothes (82:21 - 82:26)
which which that was like the first (82:24 - 82:27)
thing I did was like there&#39;s a there&#39;s (82:26 - 82:29)
there was like a female only pair of (82:27 - 82:32)
pants it was just literally cargo pants (82:29 - 82:34)
I don&#39;t know why the males didn&#39;t have a (82:32 - 82:36)
set of cargo pants but like as soon as (82:34 - 82:37)
the thing opened up I was like oh man (82:36 - 82:39)
these pants look great like I I&#39;m (82:37 - 82:41)
putting these pants on I don&#39;t know why (82:39 - 82:43)
they were female they&#39;re just cargo (82:41 - 82:46)
pants but I was like cool I got a new (82:43 - 82:49)
pair of pants for free so that was like (82:46 - 82:51)
like it was it was like wear any clothes (82:49 - 82:53)
you wanted I hear that there&#39;s belts now (82:51 - 82:55)
for male character yeah well that&#39;s part (82:53 - 82:59)
of wear any clothes that you want um it (82:55 - 83:03)
was more hairstyles it was Heights it (82:59 - 83:06)
was weights it was a lot of the a lot of (83:03 - 83:09)
the foundation that you are seeing (83:06 - 83:12)
now (83:09 - 83:15)
um and it there was people including (83:12 - 83:17)
myself being like fix the clipping (83:15 - 83:20)
system it&#39;s it sucks to buy like a shirt (83:17 - 83:21)
for (83:20 - 83:23)
$2.50 and then the shirt doesn&#39;t work (83:21 - 83:26)
with the pants that you spent $2 on like (83:23 - 83:28)
that&#39;s (83:26 - 83:31)
frustrating (83:28 - 83:31)
um and it it&#39;s like they took I don&#39;t (83:31 - 83:37)
know this is just my opinion but it it (83:35 - 83:39)
it&#39;s like they took like the Bare Bones (83:37 - 83:41)
of that those conversations and we like (83:39 - 83:42)
we did (83:41 - 83:46)
it but it (83:42 - 83:48)
wasn&#39;t I don&#39;t know it it&#39;s like they (83:46 - 83:51)
miss the like how people connect with (83:48 - 83:55)
the character kind of part yeah (83:51 - 83:55)
um and and more feedback has G been (83:57 - 84:03)
given I mean Niantic asked on Twitter (84:00 - 84:05)
for feedback they they they asked (84:03 - 84:10)
creators again I I I gave my feedback (84:05 - 84:12)
um other creators gave their feedback (84:10 - 84:14)
it&#39;s it&#39;s the feedback you expected like (84:12 - 84:16)
I read a lot of the feedback too I was (84:14 - 84:17)
like I&#39;m (84:16 - 84:20)
wondering if people are saying things (84:17 - 84:24)
differently than what I am saying and if (84:20 - 84:26)
you ignore the toxic feedback which is (84:24 - 84:28)
very easy to ignore cuz those people (84:26 - 84:30)
suck anyways and you just look at people (84:28 - 84:32)
who genuinely care about the game or (84:30 - 84:35)
care about wanting people to feel like (84:32 - 84:37)
themselves it the feedback is all the (84:35 - 84:41)
same it&#39;s you know hairstyles it&#39;s my (84:37 - 84:43)
body looks kind of weird we need more (84:41 - 84:47)
sliders it&#39;s the skin colors look weird (84:43 - 84:51)
it&#39;s my stuff isn&#39;t as vibrant as before (84:47 - 84:53)
it&#39;s it all seems (84:51 - 84:55)
fixable for sure (84:53 - 84:57)
like it doesn&#39;t seem like like they need (84:55 - 85:00)
to scrap what is there and start over it (84:57 - 85:03)
just seems like they need to fix what&#39;s (85:00 - 85:04)
currently there it it seems like a (85:03 - 85:07)
fixable (85:04 - 85:07)
problem it&#39;s just a question of how (85:07 - 85:13)
quickly they can fix it yeah and Pokemon (85:09 - 85:16)
go Fest is very soon (85:13 - 85:18)
yeah and we know that&#39;s a priority for (85:16 - 85:22)
them because that&#39;s their busiest season (85:18 - 85:24)
which is probably part of the reason why (85:22 - 85:26)
this is like we&#39;ll ship it now because (85:24 - 85:27)
it&#39;s (85:26 - 85:30)
working and it&#39;s good enough and go Fest (85:27 - 85:32)
is coming up and we need all Hands-On (85:30 - 85:35)
deck to make sure that go Fest works (85:32 - 85:38)
100% because that is our money for the (85:35 - 85:40)
year like that that that&#39;s not a secret (85:38 - 85:43)
to anyone that summer is what makes (85:40 - 85:46)
Niantic the most money (85:43 - 85:46)
yep um (85:50 - 85:54)
on the plus side the the new backgrounds (85:58 - 86:01)
look (86:00 - 86:04)
great I don&#39;t think any of us have them (86:01 - 86:06)
yet but all the screenshots I&#39;ve seen (86:04 - 86:07)
look (86:06 - 86:08)
fantastic (86:07 - 86:12)
yeah so anyways the reason I brought up (86:08 - 86:15)
the the the remote raid passes and the (86:12 - 86:17)
mega stuff and (86:15 - 86:20)
the distance Poké stop distance is those (86:17 - 86:22)
were all times where Niantic said (86:20 - 86:26)
verbally we hear you (86:22 - 86:26)
and they said it here again (86:27 - 86:30)
so we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see what that (86:30 - 86:38)
means yeah I mean for the for the Poké (86:34 - 86:39)
stop thing that was literally just a (86:38 - 86:41)
button click that they had to do yeah (86:39 - 86:45)
for the Mega thing that took what almost (86:41 - 86:47)
two (86:45 - 86:51)
years I think so and then for the remote (86:47 - 86:53)
raid pass thing that was also just a (86:51 - 86:55)
button thing that was we hear you we (86:53 - 86:56)
just don&#39;t (86:55 - 86:58)
[Laughter] (86:56 - 87:01)
care but that was like that was like (86:58 - 87:04)
John hanky or whoever higher up there (87:01 - 87:06)
that was (87:04 - 87:11)
their value core or ethic core of like (87:06 - 87:12)
we want people to get out and leave (87:11 - 87:13)
their (87:12 - 87:17)
house that was that wasn&#39;t (87:13 - 87:17)
like that was just like Community (87:18 - 87:23)
butting heads with niantic&#39;s core values (87:20 - 87:25)
of like we don&#39;t want you to play game (87:23 - 87:27)
at (87:25 - 87:31)
home where this specific issue has (87:27 - 87:34)
nothing to do with that at least yeah (87:31 - 87:37)
this is this is just a half-baked new (87:34 - 87:39)
feature that is just like all of their (87:37 - 87:41)
other half-baked new features except it (87:39 - 87:44)
affects everyone all the time anytime (87:41 - 87:47)
you&#39;re looking at your game yes I do I I (87:44 - 87:49)
I do know there are some people that do (87:47 - 87:50)
not care about how their character looks (87:49 - 87:54)
I get that that I don&#39;t think (87:50 - 87:57)
I think those people are the minority (87:54 - 87:58)
and there are definitely games I&#39;ve (87:57 - 88:00)
played with ha which has character (87:58 - 88:04)
customization where I don&#39;t (88:00 - 88:04)
care um like uh Elden ring that (88:04 - 88:11)
character customization was so Advanced (88:08 - 88:14)
and so indepth that it was like (88:11 - 88:16)
overwhelming I was like oh my go like (88:14 - 88:19)
like I do think about that (88:16 - 88:22)
of I (88:19 - 88:26)
don&#39;t I I don&#39;t I understand that there (88:22 - 88:28)
is a balance of making a character (88:26 - 88:31)
customization thing that is simple (88:28 - 88:34)
enough for people to mess with it and do (88:31 - 88:37)
it but also not make it so complicated (88:34 - 88:41)
where you look at it and you&#39;re like no (88:37 - 88:44)
thanks this is way too and then when I (88:41 - 88:46)
saw Elden ring I was like this is very (88:44 - 88:49)
cool that that&#39;s here I&#39;m going to put a (88:46 - 88:51)
helmet on I&#39;m never going to see my face (88:49 - 88:52)
it&#39;ll be (88:51 - 88:56)
fine we&#39;ll move on (88:52 - 88:56)
if I was to redo Elden ring I would (88:58 - 89:02)
actually probably spend maybe more time (89:00 - 89:05)
with it cuz I half the game time is in (89:02 - 89:06)
the Character Creator if it doesn&#39;t take (89:05 - 89:08)
you at least half your playthrough to (89:06 - 89:09)
make your character you&#39;re not playing (89:08 - 89:11)
that game correctly I have watched (89:09 - 89:14)
people get into Final Fantasy and spend (89:11 - 89:18)
4 hours in Final Fantasy 14 making their (89:14 - 89:21)
character everybody an entire evening (89:18 - 89:24)
the first time the real end boss the (89:21 - 89:28)
Final Fantasy 14 is your glamour (89:24 - 89:31)
dresser that is that is the end boss (89:28 - 89:33)
that is your life when you get into that (89:31 - 89:36)
game it&#39;s all about finding the correct (89:33 - 89:40)
outfit but this isn&#39;t even like an us as (89:36 - 89:42)
a community issue like (89:40 - 89:46)
Niantic always touts character custom (89:42 - 89:47)
they&#39;ve always touted they&#39;re always (89:46 - 89:49)
like you can see people in raids you can (89:47 - 89:51)
see the person you&#39;re battling like when (89:49 - 89:54)
you send the gift you can see what (89:51 - 89:56)
Pokémon standing next to them like it is (89:54 - 89:58)
part of their game it&#39;s not like this (89:56 - 90:00)
was a new thing they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve (89:58 - 90:02)
been pushing this (90:00 - 90:04)
for I they also sell clothing so that&#39;s (90:02 - 90:07)
part of it but they&#39;ve been like it&#39;s (90:04 - 90:08)
not like this was like a surprise thing (90:07 - 90:10)
where like we want you to care about (90:08 - 90:12)
your characters they already established (90:10 - 90:14)
that with the very basic character we (90:12 - 90:17)
had before it was just we were very (90:14 - 90:19)
limited with options so we just learned (90:17 - 90:21)
to deal with what was (90:19 - 90:25)
there and (90:21 - 90:27)
now some people can&#39;t navigate that (90:25 - 90:29)
myself included of like I just can&#39;t (90:27 - 90:33)
find something that fits me at this (90:29 - 90:34)
point (90:33 - 90:38)
um and a lot of the reason why I bought (90:34 - 90:40)
clothes was cuz I felt like those (90:38 - 90:41)
clothes fit (90:40 - 90:44)
me like oh sweet jeans with a chain (90:41 - 90:48)
wallet that&#39;s me (90:44 - 90:48)
yep like if if there was like an avatar (90:50 - 90:57)
holding a skateboard I&#39;d be like I want (90:54 - 90:58)
to buy that cuz that feels like that (90:57 - 91:01)
that that feels like that fits me that&#39;s (90:58 - 91:04)
what I want that doesn&#39;t exist yet if it (91:01 - 91:06)
does exist Niantic well I&#39;m not giving (91:04 - 91:07)
you any money until you fix the (91:06 - 91:10)
character C but what you do if you add a (91:07 - 91:14)
skateboard pose I&#39;m in I&#39;m (91:10 - 91:14)
interested uh hey if you&#39;re watching on (91:14 - 91:20)
YouTube uh comment whe what you feel (91:18 - 91:22)
about the character customization again (91:20 - 91:25)
I do know some people like it and (91:22 - 91:27)
there&#39;s one person on this podcast that (91:25 - 91:29)
one person the person on this podcast (91:27 - 91:32)
their Avatar looks like (91:29 - 91:35)
them like did you tweet your avatar at (91:32 - 91:37)
all I didn&#39;t yet I will after your (91:35 - 91:39)
avatar literally looks like you it is (91:37 - 91:42)
crazy I knew exactly what to do as soon (91:39 - 91:44)
as I saw the customization options and (91:42 - 91:47)
got it immediately they like had your (91:44 - 91:51)
haircut to a te in that game (91:47 - 91:56)
already yep I got lucky (91:51 - 91:56)
um yeah I would like to I would like to (91:56 - 92:02)
hear how you feel about uh Avatar or if (91:59 - 92:03)
you don&#39;t play Pokemon go if there&#39;s a (92:02 - 92:06)
game with a good Avatar system comment (92:03 - 92:08)
which which game had a good character (92:06 - 92:11)
customization thing for you I could tell (92:08 - 92:13)
you right now it&#39;s not Monster (92:11 - 92:15)
[Laughter] (92:13 - 92:18)
Hunter maybe ah maybe World got better (92:15 - 92:21)
actually World arise I think was much (92:18 - 92:25)
better than four and three anyways um (92:21 - 92:27)
well that&#39;s our show for the (92:25 - 92:31)
day uh I think oh you know actually hold (92:27 - 92:34)
on we can talk about one more thing I (92:31 - 92:37)
went Disney this is the bonus this is if (92:34 - 92:40)
you clicked off this is the bonus part I (92:37 - 92:44)
went to Disney I am not a Disney girly I (92:40 - 92:47)
think Greg is yeah Greg Greg Greg big (92:44 - 92:51)
Disney uh shout out to chel uh who works (92:47 - 92:53)
at Disney she got me in for free uh I (92:51 - 92:55)
didn&#39;t real realized how expensive (92:53 - 92:57)
Disney was until I walked there and then (92:55 - 92:58)
I looked up at the sign to a price of a (92:57 - 93:01)
ticket and I was like oh I don&#39;t think I (92:58 - 93:04)
would pay this oh well which park did (93:01 - 93:07)
you go to uh I went to Epcot first and (93:04 - 93:09)
then that was going to be the only thing (93:07 - 93:12)
I was suppos because I don&#39;t like rides (93:09 - 93:15)
um H and I was only going to do Epcot (93:12 - 93:18)
but then my dinner plans got cancelled (93:15 - 93:19)
uh and I was like oh I guess I&#39;m free (93:18 - 93:21)
for the evening so then we went to Magic (93:19 - 93:24)
Kingdom to like look around uh but the (93:21 - 93:26)
point being is part of the reason I (93:24 - 93:27)
wanted to go to Disney is because people (93:26 - 93:28)
were telling me that Disney is one of (93:27 - 93:31)
the best places to play and I will say (93:28 - 93:32)
it&#39;s (93:31 - 93:36)
good it is not better than M America no (93:32 - 93:39)
and one of the reasons I can say that is (93:36 - 93:43)
when I sat down in the China (93:39 - 93:46)
Pavilion um because Epcot is broken into (93:43 - 93:50)
countries and I ate orange chicken the (93:46 - 93:52)
most American Chinese meal you can have (93:50 - 93:54)
orange chicken I that one (93:52 - 93:57)
oh well I don&#39;t know it didn&#39;t have a (93:54 - 94:00)
line that yeah there&#39;s a reason if you (93:57 - 94:02)
go to an Epcot restaurant and it doesn&#39;t (94:00 - 94:05)
have a line there is a reason because (94:02 - 94:07)
that food is bad I thought the orange (94:05 - 94:08)
chicken was pretty good anyways when I (94:07 - 94:10)
sat down to eat the orange chicken I (94:08 - 94:13)
caught everything and then nothing else (94:10 - 94:16)
spawned and that doesn&#39;t happen at Mall (94:13 - 94:18)
of America if you sit in any of the like (94:16 - 94:21)
four food courts mall America it&#39;s two (94:18 - 94:22)
food courts but there&#39;s like a lot of (94:21 - 94:25)
restaurants in between (94:22 - 94:28)
you will get constant spawns your entire (94:25 - 94:31)
meal you will just always get spawns so (94:28 - 94:32)
I think the interesting thing about (94:31 - 94:34)
Disney is it&#39;s bigger than Mall of (94:32 - 94:37)
America obviously and it&#39;s more spread (94:34 - 94:40)
out but I I I do know that Disney (94:37 - 94:42)
complained to Niantic the very first (94:40 - 94:44)
year the game came out and there was a (94:42 - 94:45)
bunch of stops (94:44 - 94:50)
removed but the spawn (94:45 - 94:52)
density which is like the amount of (94:50 - 94:54)
spawns you see regardless of if their (94:52 - 94:57)
stops or not is just not the same as (94:54 - 95:00)
Mall of (94:57 - 95:03)
America like it was very easy for me (95:00 - 95:05)
with Disney being lured up because it (95:03 - 95:07)
was Heracross radar so almost everything (95:05 - 95:09)
had a lure for me to have an incense for (95:07 - 95:13)
me to have palia on I could catch (95:09 - 95:15)
everything and be like okay well we got (95:13 - 95:17)
to keep moving I caught them all that (95:15 - 95:20)
does not happen at Mall of America it is (95:17 - 95:23)
impossible if you have palia incense (95:20 - 95:25)
everything is lured up there&#39;s just so (95:23 - 95:28)
many Pokemon that it&#39;s (95:25 - 95:32)
just you just can&#39;t catch them all even (95:28 - 95:33)
if you had the plus plus going and (95:32 - 95:35)
you&#39;re manually catching you just you (95:33 - 95:38)
you can&#39;t you can&#39;t keep up MH M (95:35 - 95:41)
America&#39;s busted good (95:38 - 95:41)
MH it&#39;s (95:42 - 95:48)
also easier to (95:45 - 95:50)
maneuver there I mean there&#39;s only so (95:48 - 95:52)
many places there&#39;s there&#39;s one circular (95:50 - 95:54)
path that you will take through m (95:52 - 95:58)
America every time and Disney (95:54 - 96:01)
Gets convoluted with how you have to get (95:58 - 96:05)
to places there are crowds that it isn&#39;t (96:01 - 96:08)
easy to move through Disney if it&#39;s (96:05 - 96:10)
super super (96:08 - 96:13)
busy (96:10 - 96:13)
um yeah and you would think though that (96:13 - 96:19)
like the other thing is like when you&#39;re (96:17 - 96:21)
at Mall of America even for like (96:19 - 96:22)
something that&#39;s not as exciting as a (96:21 - 96:25)
Heracross raid day the filled to 20 and (96:22 - 96:27)
if if if like Greg and I are playing (96:25 - 96:28)
together and Greg gets in one and he&#39;s (96:27 - 96:30)
like oh mine&#39;s 20 and I&#39;ll jump in (96:28 - 96:31)
another one and it&#39;ll be like oh that (96:30 - 96:34)
one will go to 20 MH there was never a (96:31 - 96:36)
raid at M America that went to 20 but I (96:34 - 96:38)
actually don&#39;t like fault people for (96:36 - 96:40)
that because like I I would assume if (96:38 - 96:42)
you&#39;re like a season this is just me (96:40 - 96:44)
guessing if you&#39;re a season pass holder (96:42 - 96:45)
you&#39;d probably go to Disney to be like (96:44 - 96:47)
this is a good place to play Pokemon go (96:45 - 96:49)
right but if you&#39;re like me who&#39;s never (96:47 - 96:52)
been to Disney and if I was to pay for (96:49 - 96:55)
my own ticket which I didn&#39;t I would be (96:52 - 96:58)
like I need to pay attention I need to (96:55 - 97:00)
do I need to get the value out of this (96:58 - 97:03)
park yeah actually having the experience (97:00 - 97:05)
that you paid for instead of just having (97:03 - 97:08)
it be a location you paid to go play (97:05 - 97:11)
Pokemon go what I did when I was there (97:08 - 97:14)
is I would play while I was waiting in (97:11 - 97:15)
line for a ride and I think that&#39;s what (97:14 - 97:18)
most people do because what else you&#39;re (97:15 - 97:20)
going to do for an hour and a (97:18 - 97:23)
half like you are in these lines for an (97:20 - 97:27)
in incredibly long time and so I think (97:23 - 97:31)
one of the weird things about the Disney (97:27 - 97:32)
Experience (97:31 - 97:35)
is unlike Mall of America which is you (97:32 - 97:38)
people are there to play pretty much (97:35 - 97:40)
constantly and they are always (97:38 - 97:43)
interacting with the app I think the app (97:40 - 97:46)
is hit in very specific spurts by very (97:43 - 97:49)
specific people um and then you&#39;ll get a (97:46 - 97:52)
certain way into the ride when you just (97:49 - 97:54)
don&#39;t have good cell service anymore (97:52 - 97:55)
like you just (97:54 - 97:58)
don&#39;t you just aren&#39;t and there&#39;s other (97:55 - 98:00)
things to keep your attention and once (97:58 - 98:02)
you get close enough like you kind of (98:00 - 98:03)
have to pay attention to where you&#39;re (98:02 - 98:05)
being directed so your phone goes away (98:03 - 98:07)
and you have to start storing things and (98:05 - 98:09)
getting ready to actually do the event (98:07 - 98:13)
that you&#39;re there um so yeah (98:09 - 98:16)
it it is definitely a big place to play (98:13 - 98:18)
and there&#39;s a lot of people there but I (98:16 - 98:19)
I do I also agree I don&#39;t think it is (98:18 - 98:22)
better than the sort of targeted (98:19 - 98:25)
constant spawns of Mall of America (98:22 - 98:28)
yeah yeah I think some people think that (98:25 - 98:31)
like Pokemon spawns are related to the (98:28 - 98:33)
amount of stops because there are a lot (98:31 - 98:36)
of stops at Disney ton of stops but like (98:33 - 98:39)
go to a Walmart parking lot there will (98:36 - 98:41)
probably be only be one stop but you (98:39 - 98:44)
will probably get like a ton of spawns (98:41 - 98:46)
because it&#39;s just based off it&#39;s just (98:44 - 98:48)
based off cell phones it&#39;s just like how (98:46 - 98:49)
some people live in an (98:48 - 98:52)
apartment and some apartments have a ton (98:49 - 98:54)
of stops because those people are (98:52 - 98:56)
probably not connecting their mobile (98:54 - 98:58)
phone to their Wi-Fi or maybe they just (98:56 - 99:01)
don&#39;t have Wi-Fi um and then some (98:58 - 99:04)
apartments might not have any spawns (99:01 - 99:06)
cuz usually the apartments that don&#39;t (99:04 - 99:08)
have any spawns are the apartments (99:06 - 99:12)
offering free Wi-Fi for (99:08 - 99:14)
everyone just what it comes down to is (99:12 - 99:16)
like how many phones are I I don&#39;t (99:14 - 99:20)
remember how often Niantic refreshes the (99:16 - 99:22)
cell phone map they I think people used (99:20 - 99:24)
to figure out when they would do it and (99:22 - 99:26)
I think it&#39;s just it just refreshes (99:24 - 99:28)
every now and (99:26 - 99:31)
then (99:28 - 99:33)
um last point I want to make this has (99:31 - 99:35)
nothing to do with uh well I guess it (99:33 - 99:37)
has to do with my job uh I get this (99:35 - 99:41)
comment like once or twice on a YouTube (99:37 - 99:43)
thing of people saying that like why (99:41 - 99:45)
does Steve always bring up that Pokemon (99:43 - 99:47)
paid for this or or they like last week (99:45 - 99:49)
I was like hey I went to Regionals just (99:47 - 99:51)
the heads up Pokemon paid for my $14 (99:49 - 99:53)
ticket I know it&#39;s only $14 but I do (99:51 - 99:54)
have to disclose this (99:53 - 99:58)
this is leg I legally have to yes you do (99:54 - 100:01)
so everyone does I know that some of you (99:58 - 100:03)
guys are maybe on Tik Tok and you&#39;re (100:01 - 100:05)
seeing stuff and people on Tik Tok do (100:03 - 100:08)
not disclose they need to legally like (100:05 - 100:10)
they should and there&#39;s a lot of (100:08 - 100:12)
creators that don&#39;t or there&#39;s a lot of (100:10 - 100:14)
creators that don&#39;t think they need to (100:12 - 100:17)
disclose because it was valueless to (100:14 - 100:20)
them this is off (100:17 - 100:23)
ftc.gov Financial relationships are not (100:20 - 100:24)
limited to money disclose the (100:23 - 100:26)
relationship if you got anything of (100:24 - 100:28)
value to mention a product if a brand (100:26 - 100:31)
gives you free or discounted products or (100:28 - 100:33)
other parts and you mention one of its (100:31 - 100:35)
products you need to disclose even if (100:33 - 100:37)
you were not asked to mention that (100:35 - 100:39)
product don&#39;t assume your followers (100:37 - 100:40)
already know about your brand (100:39 - 100:42)
relationships this is why I bring this (100:40 - 100:45)
up because not everyone listens to every (100:42 - 100:47)
episode this might be their very first (100:45 - 100:49)
episode of the show they&#39;re listening to (100:47 - 100:51)
make sure your (100:49 - 100:54)
disclosure wait I don&#39;t make sure dis OS (100:51 - 100:56)
even if you think your evaluations are (100:54 - 100:58)
unbiased keep in mind that tags like (100:56 - 101:00)
likes pins similar way of showing your (100:58 - 101:03)
brands or products can be endorsement if (101:00 - 101:07)
you&#39;re posting abroad US law applies if (101:03 - 101:09)
if it&#39;s reasonable or foreseeable that (101:07 - 101:12)
the post will affect us consumers (101:09 - 101:15)
foreign laws might apply if you have no (101:12 - 101:16)
brand relationship and you are just (101:15 - 101:18)
telling people about product you bought (101:16 - 101:20)
and happen to like you do not declare (101:18 - 101:24)
that you don&#39;t have a brand relationship (101:20 - 101:26)

ftc.gov the gov does not not zashi (101:29 - 101:34)
in.gov (101:32 - 101:37)
ftc.gov these are legal (101:34 - 101:41)
requirements and FYI a lot of people are (101:37 - 101:43)
very bad at doing (101:41 - 101:46)
that there&#39;s a lot of people who should (101:43 - 101:50)
disclose who do (101:46 - 101:50)
not so even if you got something for (101:51 - 101:57)
free from a company let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s (101:54 - 102:00)
say that like regionals was free but the (101:57 - 102:03)
Pokemon company gave me a media pass so (102:00 - 102:05)
like it was it was still free for me to (102:03 - 102:07)
go but they gave me like a media pass so (102:05 - 102:10)
whatever I could carry a camera or maybe (102:07 - 102:12)
I got access to a special room you still (102:10 - 102:14)
have to disclose that and if this is a (102:12 - 102:17)
YouTube video or a podcast which it is a (102:14 - 102:18)
podcast so I&#39;m going to verbally say (102:17 - 102:20)
that if it&#39;s a YouTube video there&#39;s a (102:18 - 102:21)
little button you have to check that (102:20 - 102:23)
says like paid promotion MH that paid (102:21 - 102:26)
promotion is even if it was free you (102:23 - 102:28)
need to check that and it needs to (102:26 - 102:29)
appear in the upper leftand corner the (102:28 - 102:33)
amount of creators that don&#39;t do that is (102:29 - 102:36)
alarming because they don&#39;t feel like (102:33 - 102:38)
that is something of value to them but (102:36 - 102:40)
it it it is it is legally from the (102:38 - 102:42)
Federal Trade Commission you need to (102:40 - 102:44)
disclose that now I&#39;m not a snitch I&#39;m (102:42 - 102:46)
not a tattletail I ain&#39;t GNA go out (102:44 - 102:49)
there and tell you who&#39;s not doing what (102:46 - 102:50)

you don&#39;t need to disclose that no you (102:50 - 102:55)
do I&#39;m just trying to do it properly and (102:52 - 102:57)
I&#39;m trying to maintain relationships (102:55 - 102:59)
with people and also I don&#39;t want the (102:57 - 103:03)
FTC or the government to come after me (102:59 - 103:05)
it&#39;s just very easy to just just in a (103:03 - 103:08)

to do and it&#39;s very transparent and I (103:13 - 103:18)
would like to be transparent with people (103:16 - 103:19)
