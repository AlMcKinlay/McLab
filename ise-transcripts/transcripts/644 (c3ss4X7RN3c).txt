all right I am recording I am (0:01 - 0:04)
[Music] (0:05 - 0:14)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:15 - 0:18)
the (0:17 - 0:21)
644 episode of the Pokemon podcast it&#39;s (0:18 - 0:23)
super effective I am your host Steve we (0:21 - 0:25)
are recording this on a different day uh (0:23 - 0:27)
with me is (0:25 - 0:29)
Hannah on a different day but the the (0:27 - 0:32)
day after the very next day from the (0:29 - 0:35)
last one I&#39;m here I I did not go on a (0:32 - 0:38)
very very long Pokemon walk this morning (0:35 - 0:40)
I also didn&#39;t hop on my exercise bike (0:38 - 0:42)
that&#39;s more of a weekday thing oh my (0:40 - 0:45)
gosh you only lasted a whole (0:42 - 0:47)
week a weekday thing we&#39;re still on the (0:45 - 0:50)
weekend okay (0:47 - 0:52)
okay Bobby also (0:50 - 0:56)
here uh I also played no Pok√©mon go I (0:52 - 0:59)
begrudgingly played Pokemon sleep while (0:56 - 1:01)
needing to feed Snorlax and I played way (0:59 - 1:04)
too much pocket in the last like 24 (1:01 - 1:06)
hours or 12 (1:04 - 1:06)
hours can (1:07 - 1:12)
I okay I know we don&#39;t really have any (1:09 - 1:14)
sleep news because it&#39;s like this week (1:12 - 1:17)
should be Eevee week when this podcast (1:14 - 1:20)
is coming out um I just want to give (1:17 - 1:23)
somebody a a quick tip if you hate (1:20 - 1:25)
feeding Snorlax or maybe you wake up at (1:23 - 1:29)
like 12:06 p.m. and you&#39;re like I missed (1:25 - 1:31)
breakfast (1:29 - 1:34)
I&#39;m not saying you should do this but (1:31 - 1:37)
maybe if you go into your phone settings (1:34 - 1:42)
and just change your time zone (1:37 - 1:44)
no and then open the (1:42 - 1:48)
app you can feed (1:44 - 1:48)
breakfast I really wake up to those (1:49 - 1:55)
fresh Mountain Denver (1:51 - 1:58)
air I wake up to that a lot in the (1:55 - 2:00)
morning (1:58 - 2:01)
I do (2:00 - 2:04)
think here&#39;s here&#39;s just like a personal (2:01 - 2:06)
side before we get into today&#39;s episode (2:04 - 2:11)
I always hate uh I always hate the like (2:06 - 2:12)
as somebody who like works for (2:11 - 2:16)
themselves uh I would have friends or (2:12 - 2:18)
just people in my life that would be (2:16 - 2:21)
like you should really have like a 9 to5 (2:18 - 2:23)
work schedule because like I&#39;ll stream a (2:21 - 2:25)
lot at (2:23 - 2:27)
night or I&#39;ll I like I&#39;ll stay up till (2:25 - 2:29)
like 4:00 a.m. and then I wake up at (2:27 - 2:31)
noon and then it&#39;s like it&#39;s 12:02 maybe (2:29 - 2:33)
I need to switch my time zone real quick (2:31 - 2:36)
to give stex breakfast but (2:33 - 2:38)
uh look I&#39;m paying $10 a month for this (2:36 - 2:40)
game he&#39;s getting breakfast every day I (2:38 - 2:41)
didn&#39;t know this was (2:40 - 2:43)
possible he&#39;s getting breakfast every (2:41 - 2:46)
day whether he wants it or (2:43 - 2:50)
not but uh I always hated the (2:46 - 2:53)
like well every like things are going (2:50 - 2:55)
wrong in your life or like we can&#39;t ever (2:53 - 2:57)
hang out because you don&#39;t work a 9 to5 (2:55 - 2:59)
uh or you should adjust your streaming (2:57 - 3:01)
schedule or whatever first off there&#39;s (2:59 - 3:03)
like so many people in the world that (3:01 - 3:07)
work not about to say that what it&#39;s not (3:03 - 3:10)
abnormal to not work 9 to5 like I can (3:07 - 3:12)
tell you the people near the train (3:10 - 3:13)
station near my house they&#39;re working (3:12 - 3:17)
every night at like 9900 p.m. to (3:13 - 3:18)
whatever they&#39;re doing on the train (3:17 - 3:22)
every single day um but I do think that (3:18 - 3:24)
if I lived in (3:22 - 3:28)
California I would have a better sleep (3:24 - 3:31)
schedule because I am like naturally (3:28 - 3:34)
tired at 4:00 a.m. and then I get up at (3:31 - 3:37)
noon okay central time so it would be 2 (3:34 - 3:41)
a.m. it would be too so I if I if I (3:37 - 3:44)
lived that&#39;s not really how that works (3:41 - 3:47)
work that way yeah it is that no you (3:44 - 3:49)
know how when you travel to Japan you (3:47 - 3:51)
get really tired from the jet lag but (3:49 - 3:54)
then your body adjusts not me cuz I&#39;m (3:51 - 3:56)
sleeping on that plane so if you&#39;re (3:54 - 3:59)
naturally going to sleep at 4:00 a.m. (3:56 - 4:00)
that&#39;s your natural sleep (3:59 - 4:03)
and Japan is 16 hours ahead of you that (4:00 - 4:05)
would mean that your natural sleep cycle (4:03 - 4:07)
would be putting you to bed at oh 8:00 (4:05 - 4:10)
p.m. okay actually that that might work (4:07 - 4:12)
actually yeah see you (4:10 - 4:15)
see no and especially if you&#39;re walking (4:12 - 4:18)
all day 800 p.m. seems like an awesome (4:15 - 4:19)
time to go to (4:18 - 4:21)
bed just kind of walked myself right (4:19 - 4:24)
into that one (4:21 - 4:27)
okay kind of on something (4:24 - 4:31)
here uh okay anyways uh for there&#39;s your (4:27 - 4:36)
Pokemon sleep segment (4:31 - 4:36)
for also just a side note on how Pokemon (4:36 - 4:41)
sleep works I kind the or as the Plus+ (4:39 - 4:45)
works I&#39;m pretty sure it doesn&#39;t (4:41 - 4:48)
actually care when you start (4:45 - 4:51)
it I think what it does is it sees (4:48 - 4:53)
whatever the end time is and then goes (4:51 - 4:56)
backwards of like it&#39;s it was on for (4:53 - 4:59)
like eight hours because if you change (4:56 - 5:01)
the time (4:59 - 5:04)
Zone not saying you should but if you no (5:01 - 5:06)
one&#39;s cheating in Pokemon sleep well (5:04 - 5:07)
some people are cuz they got (5:06 - 5:09)
[Laughter] (5:07 - 5:13)
banned so I hit here I&#39;m just G to give (5:09 - 5:15)
you a situation I hit my plus plus at (5:13 - 5:18)
406 a.m. which would mean it would be (5:15 - 5:22)
the next day and then I woke up at noon (5:18 - 5:24)
today because we&#39;re recording here at (5:22 - 5:28)
like 12 12:30 p.m. and so when I (5:24 - 5:29)
switched it to that fresh Denver air (5:28 - 5:32)
that I need when I wake up it says that (5:29 - 5:36)
my Plus+ started at 3:06 a.m. and I woke (5:32 - 5:39)
up at 11 a.m. (5:36 - 5:41)
interesting so (5:39 - 5:45)
even and if I if if I wake up at like uh (5:41 - 5:49)
2 pm in the afternoon and I switch it (5:45 - 5:51)
to me and Bobby had a sleepover so I&#39;m (5:49 - 5:53)
waking up in California (5:51 - 5:56)
time it would then say like oh you (5:53 - 5:57)
didn&#39;t start it at 3:00 a.m. you (5:56 - 6:01)
actually started it at 1 (5:57 - 6:05)
am so I think the Plus+ is just saying (6:01 - 6:07)
what&#39;s the end time and go back to how (6:05 - 6:09)
you started it so because the Plus+ is (6:07 - 6:12)
also reacting to the time zone change (6:09 - 6:14)
I&#39;ll give you one that&#39;s it&#39;s still (6:12 - 6:15)
reacting to the time zone change either (6:14 - 6:17)
way (6:15 - 6:21)
I&#39;m yeah I&#39;m not sure this works the way (6:17 - 6:23)
you&#39;re explaining it well (6:21 - 6:26)
so yeah it definitely just changes the (6:23 - 6:27)
time so the time zone just changes so (6:26 - 6:30)
like if you went to bed you know at (6:27 - 6:31)
whatever time you went to bed doesn&#39;t (6:30 - 6:32)
really matter like when you change your (6:31 - 6:34)
time zone on your phone it just the (6:32 - 6:36)
whole thing backs up an hour right the (6:34 - 6:37)
whole thing backs up two hours or (6:36 - 6:40)
whatever so everything backs up two (6:37 - 6:44)
hours but um what I had what I actually (6:40 - 6:45)
dealt with was kind of the other side of (6:44 - 6:46)
this I don&#39;t know if anybody else did (6:45 - 6:48)
but on day when we changed the clocks (6:46 - 6:51)
last week last week yeah last I guess it (6:48 - 6:54)
was last week was it last week okay two (6:51 - 6:57)
weeks ago according to podcast okay yeah (6:54 - 7:00)
yeah two weeks on November 3r (6:57 - 7:05)
however long ago that was uh I I slept (7:00 - 7:08)
until 9:30 in the morning or something (7:05 - 7:11)
and when I opened my the thing it said I (7:08 - 7:14)
was sleeping until 10 10:30 cuz like it (7:11 - 7:16)
didn&#39;t take into account that the clocks (7:14 - 7:19)
went back an hour so even though it was (7:16 - 7:22)
only 9:30 a.m. I when I woke up it told (7:19 - 7:25)
me I was sleeping until 10:30 a.m. which (7:22 - 7:28)
hadn&#39;t happened yet sleep apps have (7:25 - 7:30)
trouble accounting for daylight savings (7:28 - 7:32)
okay all of them so that I was thinking (7:30 - 7:34)
like yeah I don&#39;t know how it tracks it (7:32 - 7:36)
in that way but it was like it gave me (7:34 - 7:39)
like more sleep it was like 10 hours of (7:36 - 7:40)
sleep or something instead of like (7:39 - 7:42)
whatever it should have been because it (7:40 - 7:43)
couldn&#39;t figure out the Daylight Saving (7:42 - 7:45)
Time stuff (7:43 - 7:47)
so I don&#39;t know like when it comes to (7:45 - 7:48)
time zones daylight like all that stuff (7:47 - 7:50)
I&#39;m not sure how it all works but like (7:48 - 7:51)
it (7:50 - 7:54)
definitely is weird if you start messing (7:51 - 7:56)
with time zones the only reason I bring (7:54 - 7:59)
up like the Plus+ moving is because one (7:56 - 8:03)
if you did hit it at like 4:04 (7:59 - 8:08)
a.m. moving the time zone fixes that yep (8:03 - 8:11)
and but if your sleep time is like (8:08 - 8:15)
2:30 and you move the time zone you are (8:11 - 8:17)
now not hitting (8:15 - 8:20)
snorlax&#39;s like preferred like get ready (8:17 - 8:23)
for bed so then you don&#39;t get the reward (8:20 - 8:25)
so like if I did go to bed if I did go (8:23 - 8:28)
to bed on time but then I woke up at (8:25 - 8:31)
like 12:02 p.m. and it&#39;s like oh I (8:28 - 8:32)
missed breakfast by 2 minutes let me (8:31 - 8:35)
move back an hour yeah I&#39;m also moving (8:32 - 8:36)
back my start time an hour which means (8:35 - 8:39)
Snorlax is like you didn&#39;t you went to (8:36 - 8:40)
bed too early which is a weird (8:39 - 8:43)
punishment that that game does for you (8:40 - 8:45)
know what it is weird but when you think (8:43 - 8:47)
about it you want your sleeve to be (8:45 - 8:49)
consistent so I think that that&#39;s a (8:47 - 8:51)
fairly good thing actually you want your (8:49 - 8:52)
sleeve to be consistent I love (8:51 - 8:56)
inconsistency science based generally (8:52 - 8:58)
keeping a consistent sleep schedule (8:56 - 9:00)
including on the weekends is a good (8:58 - 9:01)
thing I think that that&#39;s one of the (9:00 - 9:03)
tips that Pokemon sleep tells you when (9:01 - 9:06)
you&#39;re cooking your Snorlax food that (9:03 - 9:09)
nobody reads probably (9:06 - 9:12)
so so what&#39;s interesting to me is that (9:09 - 9:16)
if the time zone moves that the like (9:12 - 9:17)
time you&#39;re supposed to go to (9:16 - 9:21)
sleep doesn&#39;t move so like the the Sleep (9:17 - 9:23)
whatever your sleep set time is like 2 (9:21 - 9:25)
a.m. let&#39;s say it&#39;s 2 am. and then you (9:23 - 9:30)
move your time zone it&#39;s still 2 am. mhm (9:25 - 9:31)
yeah that makes sense you switched your (9:30 - 9:34)
time zone yes think it you think it (9:31 - 9:36)
would like switch that would also switch (9:34 - 9:38)
it&#39;s the time zone this is why Pokemon (9:36 - 9:40)
sleep is actually a terrible game for (9:38 - 9:42)
anyone who (9:40 - 9:45)
travels like it oh yeah if if you&#39;re (9:42 - 9:47)
like if you&#39;re like a businessman if (9:45 - 9:49)
you&#39;re like Larry and you&#39;re walking on (9:47 - 9:51)
the airplane with your suitcase and (9:49 - 9:53)
you&#39;re constantly traveling and you&#39;re (9:51 - 9:56)
like in hotels like two two times a week (9:53 - 9:59)
surprise surprise jet lag and changing (9:56 - 10:02)
time zones is bad for Sleep actual sleep (9:59 - 10:03)
and Pokemon (10:02 - 10:09)
sleep like if if you were to go to Japan (10:03 - 10:10)
this (10:09 - 10:14)
week say goodbye to srank ranking at all (10:10 - 10:17)
like it would be impossible (10:14 - 10:20)
yeah yeah and you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re (10:17 - 10:21)
you&#39;re punished you&#39;re punished in (10:20 - 10:24)
Pokemon sleep for like traveling to a (10:21 - 10:28)
different country well it to TI&#39;s point (10:24 - 10:30)
it does not let you it doesn&#39;t you&#39;re (10:28 - 10:31)
sleeping worse (10:30 - 10:34)
probably and we haven&#39;t mastered how to (10:31 - 10:37)
like get it to work on the (10:34 - 10:41)
plane yeah correct that might not ever (10:37 - 10:43)
happen you just have to like manually (10:41 - 10:46)
enter yeah yeah I am curious if the (10:43 - 10:49)
watch support works with (10:46 - 10:52)
that but the watch you can&#39;t like you (10:49 - 10:54)
guys have watch I have a watch I&#39;ve (10:52 - 10:56)
never used it to sleep I was like you (10:54 - 10:58)
guys have watches you probably wear it (10:56 - 11:00)
on the plane though yeah I do (10:58 - 11:03)
but do you do you you don&#39;t tell the (11:00 - 11:06)
watch you&#39;re going to sleep you can you (11:03 - 11:08)
set up like a sleep you do a sleep Focus (11:06 - 11:10)
mode and then you can put it into the (11:08 - 11:12)
Sleep focus and it&#39;s kind of like (11:10 - 11:15)
telling your Watcher went to sleep okay (11:12 - 11:17)
I will try this this is good it also it (11:15 - 11:18)
also does base it off like your (11:17 - 11:21)
movements as well so like it if even if (11:18 - 11:23)
you put the Sleep Focus mode on it&#39;s not (11:21 - 11:25)
like the go Plus+ where you&#39;re like (11:23 - 11:27)
activating a sleep mode that the Pokemon (11:25 - 11:30)
go would or Pokemon sleep would track (11:27 - 11:31)
like you still have to have the watch (11:30 - 11:33)
still for some period of time for it to (11:31 - 11:36)
know it&#39;s like you&#39;re actually asleep (11:33 - 11:38)
yeah but still is relative since it&#39;s (11:36 - 11:40)
attached to your body and it&#39;s and it&#39;s (11:38 - 11:42)
tracking your heart rate and all of that (11:40 - 11:43)
I feel like it might have a better (11:42 - 11:45)
chance of telling that you&#39;re asleep if (11:43 - 11:47)
you fall asleep on a plane but this is (11:45 - 11:49)
this is only if you are actually falling (11:47 - 11:54)
asleep yeah yeah I mean like my plane (11:49 - 11:56)
strategy is always the same it is have (11:54 - 11:59)
like a an 88 a.m. flight don&#39;t go to bed (11:56 - 12:02)
bed the night (11:59 - 12:02)
before bring benad (12:03 - 12:09)
dril and then wait for the the the (12:06 - 12:12)
dinner service which is usually like 30 (12:09 - 12:14)
minutes after you hit (12:12 - 12:16)
altitude eat and then take the benad (12:14 - 12:18)
drill and pass out and then hopefully (12:16 - 12:21)
wake up and be like we only got two more (12:18 - 12:24)
hours till we land that is that would (12:21 - 12:27)
never work for me I would just become (12:24 - 12:30)
more anxious as I lose my like with not (12:27 - 12:32)
sleeping the night before I&#39;d get on (12:30 - 12:34)
that plane and be like I would not be (12:32 - 12:36)
able to sleep I&#39;d be even more like like (12:34 - 12:37)
scared the (12:36 - 12:40)
entire yeah be able to fall (12:37 - 12:44)
asleep but it fixes the jet (12:40 - 12:47)
leg cuz I&#39;m I&#39;m leaving at I think my (12:44 - 12:49)
flight&#39;s at technically at 10:00 a.m. so (12:47 - 12:51)
I should be at the airport at like 8: (12:49 - 12:54)
and then I land at 2:00 p.m. the next (12:51 - 12:55)
day and you don&#39;t want to like land at 2 (12:54 - 12:59)
p.m. and be like I&#39;m tired cuz then your (12:55 - 13:00)
sleep schedule is definitely going to be (12:59 - 13:02)
messed up you got to like you got to (13:00 - 13:04)
like stay awake until like at least like (13:02 - 13:08)
8:00 p.m. before you go to (13:04 - 13:11)
bed let&#39;s come full circle we got Steve (13:08 - 13:14)
going to sleep at 8 pm again I am (13:11 - 13:16)
curious if it will track your sleep on (13:14 - 13:18)
your watch properly we will see yeah you (13:16 - 13:20)
should yeah yeah watch but my worry with (13:18 - 13:24)
like even pressing that button is it (13:20 - 13:27)
doesn&#39;t work and then it doesn&#39;t let me (13:24 - 13:29)
manually hit data which is such a (13:27 - 13:33)
complaint of this game is like you can&#39;t (13:29 - 13:38)
adjust data at all correct no but like (13:33 - 13:41)
if I&#39;m P okay I got a bone to pick I (13:38 - 13:42)
didn&#39;t know we&#39;re going to have a a huge (13:41 - 13:45)
sleep segment if I accidentally like get (13:42 - 13:50)
into my car and my Plus+ is in hold on (13:45 - 13:51)
bear with me how do you accidentally get (13:50 - 13:54)
into your car if I accidentally stumble (13:51 - 13:55)
into my (13:54 - 13:59)
car no if I get into my car and I have (13:55 - 14:02)
the Plus Plus in my like sweater pocket (13:59 - 14:03)
my hoodie pocket and then I put my seat (14:02 - 14:06)
belt on and all of a sudden it goes be (14:03 - 14:09)
and then I&#39;m like sleeping as I&#39;m like (14:06 - 14:13)
driving home like there&#39;s no way for me (14:09 - 14:16)
to this has happened for the this is why (14:13 - 14:18)
I know there&#39;s no way for me to tell the (14:16 - 14:21)
game like that was an accident or like (14:18 - 14:23)
please don&#39;t count that it&#39;s just like (14:21 - 14:26)
you have new sleep data and oh you slept (14:23 - 14:30)
two sleep points from four p.m. to 6 (14:26 - 14:32)
p.m. and here&#39;s your premium biscuit (14:30 - 14:33)
that you&#39;re going to use on the one (14:32 - 14:35)
Caterpie we found like no premium (14:33 - 14:38)
biscuit tonight but hold on you don&#39;t (14:35 - 14:41)
have to sync that (14:38 - 14:44)
though so like you don&#39;t have to sync (14:41 - 14:45)
that research and then the next time (14:44 - 14:47)
research comes up it&#39;ll just show you (14:45 - 14:49)
doesn&#39;t it just show you both of the (14:47 - 14:51)
like sleep things that (14:49 - 14:54)
happened I think you do have to sync any (14:51 - 14:56)
research it picks up is that only the (14:54 - 14:58)
watch then I know on the watch like I (14:56 - 15:00)
had it set up where where I had (14:58 - 15:02)
accidentally done something like that (15:00 - 15:03)
and then you accidentally tripped into (15:02 - 15:05)
your car I accidentally tripped into my (15:03 - 15:07)
car and then slept on the way home or (15:05 - 15:12)
something uh no czy I um I I remember (15:07 - 15:15)
having I had two it was two data points (15:12 - 15:18)
when I went to do research and it let me (15:15 - 15:21)
like delete one of them so it didn&#39;t (15:18 - 15:23)
actually take that research as as a (15:21 - 15:25)
research and then I was able to actually (15:23 - 15:28)
select the other one and as I&#39;m saying (15:25 - 15:29)
this I&#39;m now wondering if it might have (15:28 - 15:31)
that I was tracking with the go Plus+ (15:29 - 15:32)
and my watch at the same time to see (15:31 - 15:34)
what would happen and let me choose (15:32 - 15:36)
between the two but I remember clicking (15:34 - 15:38)
on something and there were two data (15:36 - 15:40)
points and I was able to actually there (15:38 - 15:42)
was a trash can icon next to them both (15:40 - 15:43)
and I could delete one and I could (15:42 - 15:45)
actually choose the other (15:43 - 15:49)
one so I don&#39;t I thought it was based on (15:45 - 15:51)
like having done the Sleep Thing Once (15:49 - 15:53)
turning it off and then the next time I (15:51 - 15:56)
went to go sleep it now had two it now (15:53 - 15:58)
had two things recorded and I was able (15:56 - 16:01)
to delete the first one yeah that might (15:58 - 16:03)
be from getting behind like if you have (16:01 - 16:06)
multiple sleep segments before you check (16:03 - 16:09)
the app I think that might happen that (16:06 - 16:11)
happens to me a lot but I&#39;m usually too (16:09 - 16:14)
tired to figure out to yeah I don&#39;t I (16:11 - 16:17)
don&#39;t ever remember a trash button but (16:14 - 16:19)
also like it doesn&#39;t tell you before you (16:17 - 16:22)
trash it like how long that session is I (16:19 - 16:23)
think it does it did it was showing me (16:22 - 16:25)
the times and it was like it was this to (16:23 - 16:26)
this and then there was another one (16:25 - 16:27)
above it that was like it was this time (16:26 - 16:29)
to this time and I was able to delete (16:27 - 16:31)
one of them I can very (16:29 - 16:34)
vaguely imagine that screen right I&#39;m (16:31 - 16:36)
going to try it today was that was that (16:34 - 16:38)
updated because I feel like when the (16:36 - 16:39)
game first came out there was like (16:38 - 16:42)
nothing no I think that&#39;s been there I (16:39 - 16:43)
think it&#39;s just that you always check (16:42 - 16:45)
the app and use the app at the right (16:43 - 16:47)
times Steve you don&#39;t get (16:45 - 16:50)
behind oh like you&#39;re like piling them (16:47 - 16:52)
up right so like you accidentally do it (16:50 - 16:55)
once and then don&#39;t check research and (16:52 - 16:58)
then do it again like when you go to (16:55 - 16:59)
sleep that night and I think the next (16:58 - 17:01)
day you&#39;re able to look at both of those (16:59 - 17:04)
data points and then remove one and then (17:01 - 17:06)
only choose like the newer one I think (17:04 - 17:07)
but I&#39;m actually I&#39;m going to try this (17:06 - 17:09)
today actually I&#39;m gonna try this and (17:07 - 17:12)
see if it if it uh works I mean it&#39;s (17:09 - 17:14)
it&#39;s like not a surprise especially on (17:12 - 17:15)
the show where we say like the worst (17:14 - 17:17)
part of sleep is the (17:15 - 17:20)
sleeping like if you do accidentally (17:17 - 17:21)
mess (17:20 - 17:25)
up or you like forgot to record an app (17:21 - 17:27)
the journal part of the game is Just (17:25 - 17:29)
useless like you like I would never go (17:27 - 17:31)
back to the journal part of the Day game (17:29 - 17:33)
and be like okay yeah these were actual (17:31 - 17:36)
proper sleep s well that&#39;s because you (17:33 - 17:39)
pregame your sleep every (17:36 - 17:42)
night Steve&#39;s waking up in Denver he&#39;s (17:39 - 17:44)
sleeping while he&#39;s brushing his teeth (17:42 - 17:47)
yeah exactly he&#39;s tripping into his car (17:44 - 17:49)
driving around the town (17:47 - 17:52)
sleeping and then when I do try to play (17:49 - 17:54)
properly the game is like no you travel (17:52 - 17:56)
you went to Japan this week how you&#39;re (17:54 - 17:58)
not you&#39;re not getting any extra rare (17:56 - 18:00)
candy (17:58 - 18:04)
how dare you leave your (18:00 - 18:04)
bed it&#39;s really two weeks though like (18:05 - 18:11)
you get the punishment on the way there (18:08 - 18:12)
and then you get the punishment on the (18:11 - 18:14)
way back yes just like how it&#39;s bad for (18:12 - 18:17)
your actual sleep and brain you&#39;re (18:14 - 18:18)
traveling too long both (18:17 - 18:24)
ways Master Trav Works sleeping on the (18:18 - 18:24)
plane what is so as someone who&#39;s never (18:26 - 18:32)
tried playing Pokemon sleep on a plane (18:29 - 18:34)
uh what is the thing that keeps it from (18:32 - 18:36)
working is it the moving is it like the (18:34 - 18:38)
fact that the plane shake like is like (18:36 - 18:40)
moving through the air so like the (18:38 - 18:42)
shakiness of it makes it not like ever (18:40 - 18:46)
think you go to sleep or is it going (18:42 - 18:48)
fast I think it&#39;s the the the even if it (18:46 - 18:50)
you can&#39;t feel the turbulence the like (18:48 - 18:52)
low level of turbulence doesn&#39;t let it (18:50 - 18:55)
sit still for the 10 minutes it needs to (18:52 - 18:57)
Okay so we&#39;ve been over this before but (18:55 - 19:00)
what about some kind of (18:57 - 19:04)
device that is like anti not (19:00 - 19:07)
anti yeah so like a gimbal like put your (19:04 - 19:09)
Pokemon go Plus+ in a gimbal or (19:07 - 19:13)
something and so it doesn&#39;t move for 10 (19:09 - 19:13)
minutes I me you could okay so if if if (19:16 - 19:23)
you were like first (19:19 - 19:25)
class hear me out if you&#39;re the first (19:23 - 19:27)
person on the (19:25 - 19:31)
plane you could act it as the plane is (19:27 - 19:34)
still loading yep especially if you have (19:31 - 19:36)
like one of those lay down (19:34 - 19:40)
seats and then because it hit its 10 (19:36 - 19:42)
minutes then the amount of turbulence (19:40 - 19:45)
shouldn&#39;t matter it would just be like a (19:42 - 19:47)
a snooz is it snoozing or dozing is like (19:45 - 19:49)
the lightest one dozing I think is the (19:47 - 19:51)
lightest just activate it before you get (19:49 - 19:52)
on the plane at that point I was (19:51 - 19:54)
thinking too just do it yeah but I think (19:52 - 19:56)
I think the walking down the tarmac (19:54 - 19:59)
would be enough to be for it to tell you (19:56 - 20:02)
like you moved you&#39;ve moved this device (19:59 - 20:05)
just hold it out in your hand I&#39;ve (20:02 - 20:07)
thought about this I&#39;ve thought about (20:05 - 20:09)
this and nobody will think it&#39;s weird no (20:07 - 20:11)
flight attendant or or a person checking (20:09 - 20:12)
you in will think it&#39;s weird that you&#39;re (20:11 - 20:14)
holding a small circular device on your (20:12 - 20:15)
hand as still as possible as you walk (20:14 - 20:20)
into a plane uh but uh I I think (20:15 - 20:22)
Hannah&#39;s right though like try try it (20:20 - 20:23)
before you get on the before you get (20:22 - 20:25)
into the or just right after you get on (20:23 - 20:27)
the plane I feel like there&#39;s plenty of (20:25 - 20:29)
time as everybody&#39;s boarding unless (20:27 - 20:32)
you&#39;re at the very last boarding (20:29 - 20:35)
group or buy a first class (20:32 - 20:39)
ticket that the real win first class (20:35 - 20:41)
ticket to play Pokemon sleep you know (20:39 - 20:43)
how much a first class ticket is in (20:41 - 20:46)
today&#39;s economy it&#39;s it&#39;s a $66,000 (20:43 - 20:49)
upgrade yeah (20:46 - 20:52)
yeah uh all right well let&#39;s let&#39;s take (20:49 - 20:54)
a quick break and then when we come back (20:52 - 20:57)
uh we&#39;re going to talk about the wild (20:54 - 21:00)
Global Wild the area event that anyone (20:57 - 21:02)
should be able to play in in Pok√©mon go (21:00 - 21:06)
so we will be right back and we are back (21:02 - 21:10)
from our break so when this podcast goes (21:06 - 21:15)
up it will be the day after the wild (21:10 - 21:16)
area in (21:15 - 21:19)
Fukuoka which I would have played at I&#39;m (21:16 - 21:21)
sure it was (21:19 - 21:28)
good cuz yeah I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure it was (21:21 - 21:31)
fine I&#39;m sure it was fantastic uh so (21:28 - 21:33)
there is then the global wild area that (21:31 - 21:37)
will be coming this week and there is a (21:33 - 21:40)
leadup to the event called into the wild (21:37 - 21:44)
so that will take place uh Monday (21:40 - 21:46)
November 18th which is when this podcast (21:44 - 21:50)
comes out until Friday November 22nd (21:46 - 21:53)
toxil will be available to hatch in 10k (21:50 - 21:55)
eggs for the first time (21:53 - 22:00)
globally and if you&#39;re if (21:55 - 22:02)
usually it says if you&#39;re lucky (22:00 - 22:06)
trainers Niantic is now saying (22:02 - 22:09)
especially fortunate trainers might had (22:06 - 22:11)
a shiny (22:09 - 22:13)
tox they got tired of your of your (22:11 - 22:17)
mocking Antics (22:13 - 22:17)
Steve which which to be fair not to (22:17 - 22:24)
defend Niantic but I&#39;m pretty sure (22:22 - 22:27)
they&#39;re saying yeah good luck getting (22:24 - 22:30)
one of these (22:27 - 22:30)
yeah (22:31 - 22:35)
actually that makes it sound even less (22:33 - 22:38)
likely just slightly more likely to get (22:35 - 22:39)
struck by lightning than the hatch of (22:38 - 22:42)
shiny toxil but give us your money (22:39 - 22:44)
please that&#39;s like I feel like that was (22:42 - 22:47)
the same or similar wording to when the (22:44 - 22:51)
shiny Garian birds were released it was (22:47 - 22:53)
not just like if you&#39;re lucky you you (22:51 - 22:56)
you&#39;ll find a shiny one now it was like (22:53 - 22:59)
extremely lucky and everything in the (22:56 - 23:01)
universe lines up at the same time (22:59 - 23:03)
trainer you will find a shiny Garian (23:01 - 23:07)
Bird Okay I I I know we always drag (23:03 - 23:11)
Niantic they deserve it totally (23:07 - 23:15)
sure I actually think this language is (23:11 - 23:20)
so Pokemon coded and not like Niantic (23:15 - 23:22)
coded mhm got it (23:20 - 23:25)
yeah because don&#39;t you like remember in (23:22 - 23:27)
like even current Pokemon games but (23:25 - 23:29)
older Pokemon games they would like give (23:27 - 23:31)
you the most do you remember like in X (23:29 - 23:35)
and Y if you wanted to check your IVs (23:31 - 23:38)
you went to like one guy that was like (23:35 - 23:41)
two houses down from Friend Safari and (23:38 - 23:43)
they he wouldn&#39;t even tell you what the (23:41 - 23:45)
numbers were yeah you had to know this (23:43 - 23:47)
the right words yeah he would be like oh (23:45 - 23:49)
this Pokemon is like beautiful on (23:47 - 23:52)
Mondays but Tuesdays it&#39;s looking a (23:49 - 23:54)
little down and that&#39;s how Pok√©mon go (23:52 - 23:58)
was too before they introduced the IV (23:54 - 24:00)
bars mhm yeah just like how Pok√©mon go (23:58 - 24:04)
was yep so like true anyways I&#39;m not (24:00 - 24:06)
trying to defend Niantic but I do think (24:04 - 24:09)
that like the Pokemon company is like (24:06 - 24:10)
you like you need to come up with (24:09 - 24:12)
something that&#39;s more rare than if (24:10 - 24:14)
you&#39;re lucky trainers but you can&#39;t say (24:12 - 24:17)
that it has to be some like obtuse (24:14 - 24:20)
like but but that like that X and Y guy (24:17 - 24:22)
gave you like the craziest answers to be (24:20 - 24:24)
like is this 30 or is this 31 man like (24:22 - 24:28)
just tell me and like why like it wasn&#39;t (24:24 - 24:30)
until (24:28 - 24:32)
sun and moon or was it was it even Ultra (24:30 - 24:33)
sun and moon where they would just like (24:32 - 24:36)
tell you the number finally I want to (24:33 - 24:39)
say sun and moon even because isn&#39;t it (24:36 - 24:44)
like amazing was that stat was 30 and or (24:39 - 24:47)
something and then 31 was like perfect (24:44 - 24:48)
or there was like it was there was some (24:47 - 24:51)
kind of terminology it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t (24:48 - 24:54)
just numbers and sun and (24:51 - 24:58)
moon yeah and the the wording was a (24:54 - 24:59)
range as well wasn&#39;t it so if it&#39;s like (24:58 - 25:02)
it&#39;s good then it&#39;s like somewhere (24:59 - 25:03)
between like 15 20 or it was something (25:02 - 25:05)
like that right I think there was a (25:03 - 25:09)
range too yeah especially fortunate (25:05 - 25:12)
[Laughter] (25:09 - 25:16)

reading these rewards Oh (25:45 - 25:48)
no just want to remind everyone that (25:50 - 25:56)
Niantic did not pay for me to go to (25:53 - 25:59)
Fukuoka there was no flight there&#39;s no (25:56 - 26:01)
Hotel (25:59 - 26:01)

raids uh if you do said raids so this is (27:02 - 27:09)
a RAID ticket everything else is some (27:05 - 27:12)
really weird decision of adding on the (27:09 - 27:14)
least they possibly can to have a list (27:12 - 27:16)
of items that that is included with the (27:14 - 27:18)
ticket is hilarious I&#39;d rather get no (27:16 - 27:21)
Pok balls than 20 Pok balls yes I&#39;m (27:18 - 27:25)
that&#39;s maybe maybe there&#39;s (27:21 - 27:27)
like maybe there&#39;s like one person at (27:25 - 27:29)
Niantic that&#39;s like (27:27 - 27:31)
okay the people who love raids are also (27:29 - 27:34)
constantly running the go Plus+ so just (27:31 - 27:38)
give them pokeballs yeah I guess but (27:34 - 27:40)
they should have a Plus+ that lets them (27:38 - 27:41)
use the other (27:40 - 27:45)
pokeballs yeah John Hank you don&#39;t like (27:41 - 27:48)
that John hanky not not a fan of the the (27:45 - 27:50)
go the the Goa (27:48 - 27:53)
devices um I assume we&#39;re there&#39;s more (27:50 - 27:55)
details to this but it&#39;s saying like (27:53 - 27:58)
Ultra Beast raids and stuff that so are (27:55 - 28:00)
Ultra Beast raids and stuff happening at (27:58 - 28:02)
during this into the wild I don&#39;t think (28:00 - 28:06)
so why would it say (28:02 - 28:08)
that oh I don&#39;t (28:06 - 28:10)
know they&#39;re not (28:08 - 28:13)
saying oh there&#39;s two tickets right is (28:10 - 28:14)
there is there two tickets you just went (28:13 - 28:15)
over the first one there&#39;s there&#39;s (28:14 - 28:18)
another ticket yeah okay (28:15 - 28:20)
okay well I I when they&#39;re saying one (28:18 - 28:23)
candy from four and five star if you (28:20 - 28:26)
don&#39;t say mega Ultra and (28:23 - 28:30)
Primal even though like (28:26 - 28:32)
I guess you could argue like Omega is (28:30 - 28:34)
like a technically a four-star raid MH (28:32 - 28:38)
an ultra and a primal oh I guess a me (28:34 - 28:41)
you could have a four-star raid that is (28:38 - 28:45)
there are Ultra nio is in five star (28:41 - 28:47)
raids on the Tuesday wait why are they (28:45 - 28:51)
bringing nio back for this event because (28:47 - 28:53)
they are oh cuz it&#39;s poison okay I guess (28:51 - 28:55)
that makes sense poison there we (28:53 - 29:00)
go the Wormhole just happens to open (28:55 - 29:02)
Go&#39;s like I&#39;m poison (29:00 - 29:04)
[Laughter] (29:02 - 29:07)
too all right that&#39;s fine that&#39;s (29:04 - 29:09)
[Laughter] (29:07 - 29:12)
fine oh is there we should have Zur tree (29:09 - 29:15)
too then we should we probably don&#39;t but (29:12 - 29:16)
we (29:15 - 29:21)
should h i that might be on my uh oh no (29:16 - 29:22)
we don&#39;t I scroll down there is no zirc (29:21 - 29:24)
Tre just night (29:22 - 29:27)
Leo uh okay so for another $5 so you can (29:24 - 29:31)
spend $10 before this event even (29:27 - 29:35)
starts so for this $5 you will get the (29:31 - 29:38)
same thing 20 pokeballs 1,000 XP 2,000 (29:35 - 29:40)
Stardust three toxic candies so I guess (29:38 - 29:42)
you&#39;re getting if you&#39;re spending $10 (29:40 - 29:45)
that&#39;s 40 pokeballs a day in no universe (29:42 - 29:50)
is that ever worth it but you could well (29:45 - 29:51)
yes but there&#39;s other things in the (29:50 - 29:53)
ticket too I&#39;m starting to see how these (29:51 - 29:54)
work I still don&#39;t understand the (29:53 - 29:57)
pokeballs I well pokeballs do cost money (29:54 - 29:59)
right I mean like you I&#39;ve never bought (29:57 - 30:02)
them myself but yeah I (29:59 - 30:04)
technically so for the the into of the (30:02 - 30:07)
wild hatch you&#39;re getting increased (30:04 - 30:12)
chance of hatching toxil from 10K (30:07 - 30:16)
eggs sure okay uh half egg hatch (30:12 - 30:19)
distance two times Stardust from (30:16 - 30:21)
hatching two times XP from hatching two (30:19 - 30:23)
times candy from hatching and then you (30:21 - 30:24)
will get (30:23 - 30:29)
out five single use incubator (30:24 - 30:31)
from spinning Pok√© stops so one a (30:29 - 30:35)
day which I like that more than the raid (30:31 - 30:38)
one have they done it before where by (30:35 - 30:40)
buying a ticket you get an increased (30:38 - 30:42)
chance of hatching a particular Pokemon (30:40 - 30:43)
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen that before yeah (30:42 - 30:45)
they have I think they I this is not the (30:43 - 30:47)
first time theyve done that I know they&#39; (30:45 - 30:50)
done it in events but yeah in events it (30:47 - 30:52)
was like ho and tour you would be more (30:50 - 30:56)
likely to get carnivine relicanth and (30:52 - 30:59)
catat no catat was not h (30:56 - 31:00)
whatever the other you&#39;re thinking about (30:59 - 31:04)
the C so yeah CNO and ho andu are both (31:00 - 31:08)
had like buying the egg thing got you (31:04 - 31:11)
more of the yeah better eggs but they (31:08 - 31:14)
they didn&#39;t say like this is slightly (31:11 - 31:16)
weird because when you got those tickets (31:14 - 31:18)
it was like you were just more likely to (31:16 - 31:21)
get 10K eggs and those Pokemon were in (31:18 - 31:25)
10k eggs right where this is saying (31:21 - 31:28)
like unless this is saying you&#39;re just (31:25 - 31:30)
more likely to get 10K eggs and that&#39;s (31:28 - 31:32)
why you will see more toxil cuz I don&#39;t (31:30 - 31:35)
know how the game is determining (31:32 - 31:39)
like the tox yeah right (31:35 - 31:41)
right because that&#39;s how they get around (31:39 - 31:46)
the the gotta laws yes yes it is (31:41 - 31:50)
right so I I&#39;m I&#39;m guessing that what (31:46 - 31:51)
they&#39;re what they&#39;re saying is you&#39;re (31:50 - 31:52)
just going to get more 10K eggs and (31:51 - 31:54)
because you&#39;re getting more 10K eggs (31:52 - 31:56)
you&#39;re getting a higher chance of toxil (31:54 - 31:58)
which is like the legal loophole that is (31:56 - 32:00)
correct and that also keeps them out of (31:58 - 32:02)
like gotta (32:00 - 32:04)
territory because I don&#39;t know how else (32:02 - 32:06)
they would do it yeah yeah I don&#39;t know (32:04 - 32:07)
I still think this is a better ticket (32:06 - 32:09)
than the raid one it is the half egg (32:07 - 32:12)
hatch distance is always a good thing (32:09 - 32:15)
and all of the hatch bonuses Stardust XP (32:12 - 32:18)
candy this is if you walk around to (32:15 - 32:20)
hatch eggs in Pokemon go this is not a (32:18 - 32:24)
bad ticket to get so 95% of America does (32:20 - 32:26)
not need this ticket because we&#39;re a car (32:24 - 32:27)
culture and you&#39;re not going to be (32:26 - 32:29)
walking anywhere (32:27 - 32:32)
you still take walks to play the game (32:29 - 32:34)
except Hannah nowadays she takes long (32:32 - 32:35)
walks and doesn&#39;t play Pokemon go that (32:34 - 32:38)
was a single Long (32:35 - 32:41)
Walk no I mean like like when I when I (32:38 - 32:45)
do think about like the hatch stuff like (32:41 - 32:48)
I I think a lot of the the hatch stuff (32:45 - 32:51)
is an incredibly good deal when you&#39;re (32:48 - 32:54)
at an event because you are walking so (32:51 - 32:56)
much and usually it&#39;s like you don&#39;t (32:54 - 32:58)
have a car because you&#39;re in a new city (32:56 - 33:01)
and so you just hatch a lot of eggs like (32:58 - 33:04)
when I&#39;m sitting here in my office (33:01 - 33:06)
and I I don&#39;t go I don&#39;t do any (33:04 - 33:08)
traveling for like a month I&#39;m not in (33:06 - 33:10)
any other city I&#39;m just like living my (33:08 - 33:14)
normal boring American life I&#39;m hatching (33:10 - 33:17)
if I&#39;m lucky like one egg a week like (33:14 - 33:21)
one 5K egg a week because I&#39;m just like (33:17 - 33:22)
I gotta drive to the post office I got (33:21 - 33:24)
to drive to UPS I got to drive to Target (33:22 - 33:26)
to buy groceries and my time walking (33:24 - 33:28)
around Target is not enough to hatch an (33:26 - 33:30)
egg (33:28 - 33:33)
but like when I&#39;m last time I was in (33:30 - 33:35)
Japan I was hatching like four eggs a (33:33 - 33:38)
day yeah because I&#39;m just like I&#39;m I&#39;m (33:35 - 33:40)
walking the the the the Subway or the (33:38 - 33:43)
trains is like sometimes just enough (33:40 - 33:46)
vibration to also just add bonus steps (33:43 - 33:49)
like like you&#39;re just hatching so many (33:46 - 33:52)
more eggs so like if if I lived in like (33:49 - 33:55)
Barcelona or Madrid or Tokyo or Osaka or (33:52 - 33:57)
like anywhere where it&#39;s like I don&#39;t (33:55 - 34:00)
need a car (33:57 - 34:02)
a more walkable place I mean I was gonna (34:00 - 34:04)
say like you don&#39;t have to go to (34:02 - 34:06)
Barcelona to get that though I mean a (34:04 - 34:09)
lot of America is fairly spread out if (34:06 - 34:10)
you live like I live I actually live in (34:09 - 34:12)
a place that has a lot of walkable stuff (34:10 - 34:14)
so I actually do walk quite a bit to go (34:12 - 34:18)
do things like during my day I am more (34:14 - 34:20)
likely walking to go someplace than (34:18 - 34:22)
driving just because of how close I live (34:20 - 34:25)
to yeah but that&#39;s definitely not all of (34:22 - 34:27)
America that&#39;s definitely not most of (34:25 - 34:29)
America but my I was going to say like (34:27 - 34:32)
do you also not like do you not take (34:29 - 34:34)
like a walk around the neighborhood or (34:32 - 34:37)
anything like that sometimes I do I I I (34:34 - 34:40)
will I will take well it&#39;s been raining (34:37 - 34:43)
the last like four days but uh every (34:40 - 34:46)
every day I try to do my two kilometers (34:43 - 34:47)
or whatever (34:46 - 34:51)
in Pogo which is like literally like the (34:47 - 34:54)
15minute incense right and I don&#39;t (34:51 - 34:56)
specifically do that for PoGo I just do (34:54 - 35:00)
that because like I don&#39;t want to die so (34:56 - 35:01)
getting out and walking is usually a (35:00 - 35:05)
good thing for people yeah definitely so (35:01 - 35:08)
but I will say Pogo encourages that more (35:05 - 35:10)
which I I guess thank you Niantic for (35:08 - 35:13)
caring about my health but like because (35:10 - 35:15)
of (35:13 - 35:18)
the um max raid (35:15 - 35:23)
particles and the 15minute incense M and (35:18 - 35:25)
I like I should spin a pok√© stop to keep (35:23 - 35:29)
my streak going and I (35:25 - 35:30)
like all the Pok√© stops are literally (35:29 - 35:31)
like three minutes from me in every (35:30 - 35:32)
direction so I just got to pick a (35:31 - 35:34)
direction and walk three minutes and TOS (35:32 - 35:36)
spin it (35:34 - 35:39)
like I will give Niantic credit I know (35:36 - 35:41)
we&#39;ve we will we said a bunch of bad (35:39 - 35:44)
things about Niantic continue but like (35:41 - 35:45)
because they&#39;ve added more points of (35:44 - 35:47)
interest and because they added that (35:45 - 35:49)
incense it does give you a it gives me (35:47 - 35:51)
at least a bigger incentive to walk (35:49 - 35:54)
around the block every day yeah but you (35:51 - 35:57)
know if I lived in New York City I&#39;d be (35:54 - 35:58)
hatching eggs non (35:57 - 36:01)
stop but one 15minute walk around the (35:58 - 36:04)
block is is not making it&#39;s making a (36:01 - 36:06)
dent and a 5k egg but I&#39;m not getting a (36:04 - 36:10)
5k egg done after 15 minutes I think the (36:06 - 36:13)
thing that I don&#39;t like so much about (36:10 - 36:18)
the like the daily incense is 15 minute (36:13 - 36:21)
timer right so and and it and it spawns (36:18 - 36:22)
based (36:21 - 36:26)
on distance walked not like once every (36:22 - 36:27)
minute or whatever like a normal incense (36:26 - 36:30)
would right so if you&#39;re standing in a (36:27 - 36:31)
place for a certain period of time (36:30 - 36:32)
you&#39;re not going to get any more spawns (36:31 - 36:34)
right that&#39;s like it it spawns once (36:32 - 36:36)
every however many seconds maybe once (36:34 - 36:38)
every minute but only if you are walking (36:36 - 36:41)
it&#39;s not based on distance but yes you (36:38 - 36:43)
do have to be walking you have to be (36:41 - 36:45)
walking you have to be moving though so (36:43 - 36:47)
it you can&#39;t just sit in your house if (36:45 - 36:49)
you I thought if you&#39;re like power (36:47 - 36:50)
walking you get way more spawns CU you (36:49 - 36:51)
do that&#39;s why I was thinking it&#39;s not (36:50 - 36:53)
On&#39;s every minute because some some (36:51 - 36:55)
people can get that up to like like 28 (36:53 - 36:58)
spawns in 15 minutes the faster you walk (36:55 - 37:01)
Pokemon spawn but um okay I was wrong (36:58 - 37:04)
nice but then that hold that like keeps (37:01 - 37:07)
me from wanting to do like a Max raid on (37:04 - 37:08)
my walk (37:07 - 37:11)
because I want the spawns to keep coming (37:08 - 37:13)
yeah but like I also pass a gym or (37:11 - 37:14)
something and it&#39;s like oh I kind of (37:13 - 37:16)
want to do that raid yeah but I don&#39;t (37:14 - 37:18)
want to stop walking you got to do the (37:16 - 37:21)
15 minutes out and pass all the things (37:18 - 37:22)
without without interacting with them on (37:21 - 37:24)
the way there and then do all the things (37:22 - 37:26)
on the way back I guess that is what I (37:24 - 37:28)
got to do is more exercise which is not (37:26 - 37:32)
a bad thing in my case (37:28 - 37:35)
so yeah uh the wild encounters for this (37:32 - 37:37)
week will be (37:35 - 37:39)
Ivysaur we&#39;re just skipping right over (37:37 - 37:41)
bubur I guess Ivysaur bell sprout (37:39 - 37:44)
weeping Bell alolan graler Magnemite (37:41 - 37:47)
Magneton Gastly Haunter Marie flaffy (37:44 - 37:52)
Roselia Gulpin Lu Luxio or Luxio Lux I (37:47 - 37:55)
think it&#39;s Luxio luio stunk stunky orede (37:52 - 37:59)
ulga fungus Den and to (37:55 - 38:01)
Maru (37:59 - 38:03)
uh everything can be shiny except those (38:01 - 38:05)
like middle stage Pokemon I said yeah (38:03 - 38:07)
what they should have done Bulbasaur so (38:05 - 38:10)
that you could be shiny and it&#39;s still (38:07 - 38:12)
grass poison right so yeah maybe they (38:10 - 38:16)
didn&#39;t do Bulbasaur to avoid the people (38:12 - 38:18)
complaining that they caught a Bulbasaur (38:16 - 38:20)
so much Bulbasaur well no they caught (38:18 - 38:21)
the Bulbasaur but then they can&#39;t like (38:20 - 38:24)
gmax or dmax the Bulbasaur so it&#39;s like (38:21 - 38:26)
actually I think Ivysaur is better (38:24 - 38:29)
because you get more candy true for your (38:26 - 38:30)
gmax (38:29 - 38:32)
Bulbasaur technically if you&#39;re were to (38:30 - 38:35)
pinap it that&#39;s true okay all right you (38:32 - 38:37)
made the argument I&#39;ll take it you&#39;re (38:35 - 38:39)
welcome Niantic (38:37 - 38:42)
uh three star raids will feature weeping (38:39 - 38:43)

[Laughter] (38:47 - 38:51)
Bells weep and Bell Haunter flaffy (38:49 - 38:55)
charab buug five star uh raids on (38:51 - 38:57)
November 19th will Mead niggo five star (38:55 - 39:00)
raids on November 20th will be tapu Coco (38:57 - 39:02)
five star raids on the 21st will be my (39:00 - 39:05)
favorite electric Pokemon origin form (39:02 - 39:07)
Diga five star raids on the 22nd is my (39:05 - 39:10)
favorite poison Pokemon origin form (39:07 - 39:14)
palia all of those can be shiny your max (39:10 - 39:17)
raid battles starting for this week will (39:14 - 39:19)
be drill bur which can be shiny it (39:17 - 39:23)
cannot giganta Max so feel free to hunt (39:19 - 39:26)
all the Dynamax drill burs you want also (39:23 - 39:27)
they&#39;re really good against toxcity when (39:26 - 39:30)
electricity to be used for the global (39:27 - 39:33)
remote raid pass limit will be increased (39:30 - 39:36)
to 20 from Monday the 18th to the (39:33 - 39:39)
21st uh there&#39;s no limit on remote raids (39:36 - 39:42)
Friday through Sunday so nitin is more (39:39 - 39:43)
than happy to take all of your money (39:42 - 39:45)
that (39:43 - 39:48)
weekend (39:45 - 39:51)
uh the it is saying that toxil is only (39:48 - 39:53)
in 10k eggs all you&#39;re getting is toxo (39:51 - 39:56)
from 10K eggs so if I would have read (39:53 - 39:58)
ahead that would have answered the (39:56 - 40:00)
question of why they&#39;re giving you a (39:58 - 40:02)
higher chance of toxle so I&#39;m very (40:00 - 40:04)
confident now that you buying the ticket (40:02 - 40:06)
is just more likely to get 10K eggs (40:04 - 40:08)
which if you bought the ticket that (40:06 - 40:12)
means those eggs would be cut in half so (40:08 - 40:15)
you&#39;re getting toxal at 5K (40:12 - 40:17)
eggs uh there will be a collection (40:15 - 40:19)
challenge there will be New Field (40:17 - 40:21)
research uh your max (40:19 - 40:23)
Monday which I guess we didn&#39;t talk (40:21 - 40:25)
about in the show where they&#39;re doing (40:23 - 40:29)
Max raids every Monday from 6 to 7 (40:25 - 40:31)
is going to be (40:29 - 40:34)
driller um which is a good thing did (40:31 - 40:37)
yeah yeah did they say is that just like (40:34 - 40:39)
literally all the max raids are just (40:37 - 40:41)
going to turn to driller for an hour (40:39 - 40:45)
yeah okay so like now they have Max (40:41 - 40:50)
Mondays which good alliteration great (40:45 - 40:53)
uhuh uh the spotlight hour on Tuesdays (40:50 - 40:57)
yep and then raid hour on Wednesdays yep (40:53 - 41:00)
and I know there&#39;s always like the (40:57 - 41:02)
people that are like from 6: to 7 is a (41:00 - 41:06)
bad time but there is like no way (41:02 - 41:08)
Niantic has not determined six to S is (41:06 - 41:11)
the best time based on their data of the (41:08 - 41:14)
amount of players playing yeah I they&#39;ve (41:11 - 41:15)
got to have that and you remember that (41:14 - 41:19)
one time when um The Raid hour was 1200 (41:15 - 41:22)
to1 when they first came out with it the (41:19 - 41:24)
rid hour was 12 to1 on Wednesdays (41:22 - 41:26)
because they they expected like business (41:24 - 41:28)
people to like sneak out (41:26 - 41:30)
and that&#39;s exactly what I did I on my (41:28 - 41:32)
lunch I got I was on my lunch at work (41:30 - 41:35)
you were the perfect customer I know I (41:32 - 41:36)
loved it when I was working in an office (41:35 - 41:38)
it was great because there was a group (41:36 - 41:41)
that would meet up at the raid spots at (41:38 - 41:42)
for 12 to1 I think it only happened like (41:41 - 41:45)
once or twice but it was great and then (41:42 - 41:47)
they&#39;re like oh we&#39;re gonna try six to 7 (41:45 - 41:49)
and I was like I&#39;m always driving home (41:47 - 41:51)
at six o&#39;clock I can&#39;t do this this is (41:49 - 41:52)
not the (41:51 - 41:55)
time so yeah you do the raids and then (41:52 - 41:58)
you drive home Bobby I had had to be I (41:55 - 42:01)
had kids to go home to I can&#39;t just be (41:58 - 42:05)
like hey I&#39;m going to raid till 7 o&#39; and (42:01 - 42:06)
then come home just in time to basically (42:05 - 42:09)
put the kids to (42:06 - 42:09)
bed there was um when I played TI you (42:09 - 42:15)
thought I was going to say Destiny when (42:13 - 42:19)
I played Titanfall 2 they did this in (42:15 - 42:22)
Titanfall where they had a it was like a (42:19 - 42:26)
bonus XP hour every day and I&#39;m pretty (42:22 - 42:28)
sure it was like six to seven and so you (42:26 - 42:31)
would get the most amount of Titanfall (42:28 - 42:34)
players in the game so your cues would (42:31 - 42:37)
be way down you would get the double XP (42:34 - 42:40)
you would it the game felt more balanced (42:37 - 42:42)
because there was such an increase of (42:40 - 42:44)
players that you were getting properly (42:42 - 42:47)
put into like you should be like bronze (42:44 - 42:48)
and this person should be platinum I (42:47 - 42:49)
actually don&#39;t think Titanfall had (42:48 - 42:50)
bronze and platinum I don&#39;t remember (42:49 - 42:53)
what the system in that game was called (42:50 - 42:55)
most systems is like bronze platinum (42:53 - 42:59)
whatever uh but it was something when (42:55 - 43:01)
the like one month I was into Titanfall (42:59 - 43:05)
2 it was like I got home like throw some (43:01 - 43:08)
laundry in I would like make a snack and (43:05 - 43:10)
then be like oh (43:08 - 43:12)
Titanfall bonus hour is about to start (43:10 - 43:13)
from 6: to (43:12 - 43:15)
[Music] (43:13 - 43:19)
7 uh so yeah I there there&#39;s never going (43:15 - 43:24)
to be a time where like everyone in the (43:19 - 43:26)
world is like this is perfect thank you (43:24 - 43:31)
Niantic like you did it like but I am (43:26 - 43:35)
assuming that based on all of their data (43:31 - 43:36)
that they&#39;re like we know we have the (43:35 - 43:39)
most amount of players between six and (43:36 - 43:43)
seven yeah I they must that must have be (43:39 - 43:44)
K because otherwise like yeah why keep (43:43 - 43:46)
it that way right if they&#39;re like not (43:44 - 43:49)
getting an a good amount of trainers out (43:46 - 43:51)
there playing there&#39;s no benefit to them (43:49 - 43:54)
so I&#39;m sure yeah (43:51 - 43:56)
yeah but it&#39;s also like at least in the (43:54 - 43:58)
midwest it&#39;s like dark at six oh it&#39;s (43:56 - 44:01)
fully dark at this point oh yeah it&#39;s (43:58 - 44:03)
very it&#39;s dark by five at this point (44:01 - 44:07)
yeah even yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not light out (44:03 - 44:10)
at all at six o&#39;clock right (44:07 - 44:10)
now (44:11 - 44:15)
um the only thing that was different (44:13 - 44:19)
from the global go wild area and I I&#39;m (44:15 - 44:22)
very confused about this choice so they (44:19 - 44:25)
announced that origin form Pia and (44:22 - 44:28)
origin form Diga (44:25 - 44:29)
which is the first time this year (44:28 - 44:31)
they&#39;re returning (44:29 - 44:35)
since February MH it&#39;s been like eight (44:31 - 44:37)
months yeah they&#39;re going to be in (44:35 - 44:41)
raids for both in person at Fukuoka and (44:37 - 44:45)
Global um but then they were like that&#39;s (44:41 - 44:48)
not good enough here&#39;s Primal Kyogre and (44:45 - 44:50)
Primal (44:48 - 44:53)
Groudon which is like I (44:50 - 44:56)
mean these are Pok√©mon that have special (44:53 - 44:59)
abilities that other Pokemon do not have (44:56 - 45:00)
they do have to bring them back every (44:59 - 45:03)
now and then and the time to bring them (45:00 - 45:06)
back is an event I then they&#39;re my four (45:03 - 45:08)
favorite gallerian (45:06 - 45:10)
legendaries this wild (45:08 - 45:12)
area but (45:10 - 45:14)
like you&#39;re you&#39;re a million percent (45:12 - 45:17)
right Anna they&#39;re they have abilities (45:14 - 45:20)
they&#39;re really popular yep but you would (45:17 - 45:23)
think that like bringing both of them (45:20 - 45:27)
back at the same time on top of debuting (45:23 - 45:31)
for the world gigantamax (45:27 - 45:33)
toxtricity yeah the primals don&#39;t have (45:31 - 45:37)
abilities though right they they don&#39;t (45:33 - 45:39)
have abilities but they have more types (45:37 - 45:41)
that they cover when they each have (45:39 - 45:44)
three types to cover oh sorry I was okay (45:41 - 45:44)
I&#39;m think I was thinking more like (45:44 - 45:47)
Adventure effects yeah yeah the origin (45:44 - 45:48)
forms have the adventure effects but the (45:47 - 45:52)
primals cover more types when you me (45:48 - 45:56)
Primal them Primal reverse Primal revers (45:52 - 45:58)
them that (45:56 - 46:02)
verb re reverse them I don&#39;t (45:58 - 46:06)
know so so like raid wise this the I (46:02 - 46:09)
think I think there&#39;s just so much going (46:06 - 46:13)
on uh so for for in three star raids on (46:09 - 46:16)
Saturday it&#39;s Snorlax wearing a jacket (46:13 - 46:19)
and then two Pokemon I forgot about that (46:16 - 46:21)
totally I forgot that was a real thing (46:19 - 46:23)
in the jacket so Snorlax wearing a (46:21 - 46:25)
jacket in three star raids and then two (46:23 - 46:28)
Pokemon you don&#39;t care about and then (46:25 - 46:31)
four star raids are toxtricity amped and (46:28 - 46:34)
then toxcity lowkey four star raids so (46:31 - 46:36)
that wasn&#39;t an error before usually (46:34 - 46:38)
fourstar raids are what spawns more (46:36 - 46:41)
stuff so we don&#39;t know if you defeating (46:38 - 46:42)
the (46:41 - 46:45)
toxcity spawns anything I don&#39;t think so (46:42 - 46:46)
but that&#39;s what fourar raids are (46:45 - 46:48)
supposed to do spawn well Mega Pokemon (46:46 - 46:51)
are also fourstar raids right so yeah (46:48 - 46:52)
they don&#39;t spawn more they&#39;re using the (46:51 - 46:55)
icon of the blue and white for oh really (46:52 - 46:57)
they&#39;re the blue and white egg yeah (46:55 - 46:59)
using the blue and white egg five star (46:57 - 47:03)
raids are going to be origin form Diga (46:59 - 47:06)
palia and then Primal raids which I (47:03 - 47:08)
guess you could say are technically (47:06 - 47:11)
six-star raids are Kyogre and Groudon (47:08 - 47:15)
yeah and then so that&#39;s that&#39;s the (47:11 - 47:18)
traditional raid thing and then they&#39;re (47:15 - 47:21)
saying gigantamax (47:18 - 47:24)
toxcity will be in six star Max raid (47:21 - 47:27)
battles during the event and then there (47:24 - 47:30)
Al saying that Drilbur (47:27 - 47:33)
Excadrill toxcity amped form and toxcity (47:30 - 47:37)
lowkey form will be in Max raid battles (47:33 - 47:42)
yeah exad dril will too yes yeah that&#39;s (47:37 - 47:46)
an insane amount of content I&#39;m really (47:42 - 47:48)
glad I am really glad that we have the (47:46 - 47:49)
traditional raids and the max raids (47:48 - 47:52)
separated out for this because the max (47:49 - 47:53)
raids you want to make sure those are (47:52 - 47:56)
spawning with how many different raids (47:53 - 47:58)
there are in the traditional raids I am (47:56 - 47:59)
a little bit concerned about people (47:58 - 48:03)
being able to find Snorlax with a jacket (47:59 - 48:06)
um because I&#39;m kind of&#39;s I&#39;m kind of (48:03 - 48:09)
seeing the primals and the origin forms (48:06 - 48:11)
as these are available for people who (48:09 - 48:13)
don&#39;t have them yet because they do need (48:11 - 48:15)
to bring those back every now and then (48:13 - 48:16)
but because they need to be in raids at (48:15 - 48:18)
the same time as other things that (48:16 - 48:21)
people want to raid which is mostly (48:18 - 48:23)
mostly going to be the Snorlax with the (48:21 - 48:28)
jacket um and I guess toxcity right (48:23 - 48:31)
um but the the traditional raid balance (48:28 - 48:34)
is going to be tricky there are going to (48:31 - 48:37)
be a lot of things in there it just (48:34 - 48:40)
like I&#39;m not complaining I I I literally (48:37 - 48:42)
said this is like a lot of content I I (48:40 - 48:44)
really do think it is like that&#39;s a lot (48:42 - 48:46)
of different things you can raid like (48:44 - 48:49)
remember like even even the summer for (48:46 - 48:52)
go Fest it was like what&#39;s in raids just (48:49 - 48:56)
necrozma I did like 140 nekrosmas like (48:52 - 48:58)
uhhuh that&#39;s that&#39;s all there was though (48:56 - 49:00)
it was just like what are you rating (48:58 - 49:02)
we&#39;re just raing necros that&#39;s all there (49:00 - 49:04)
that&#39;s all there is this is like the one (49:02 - 49:07)
thing we&#39;re doing and now it&#39;s like here (49:04 - 49:10)
are four incredibly popular (49:07 - 49:15)
legendaries and a new Pokemon that if (49:10 - 49:18)
you don&#39;t care about the dmax or gmax (49:15 - 49:20)
thing I think putting toxtricity in four (49:18 - 49:22)
stars where you and like one other (49:20 - 49:24)
friend could just be like cool I can get (49:22 - 49:26)
one of each or I could grind this out to (49:24 - 49:28)
get shiny putting a brand new like and (49:26 - 49:31)
like that works whether or not like you (49:28 - 49:34)
care about that like jigan draa (49:31 - 49:37)
turtonator it a million percent works in (49:34 - 49:40)
the sense of like hardcore raid people (49:37 - 49:44)
will spend their $2 or their dollar over (49:40 - 49:46)
and over and over again to get a shiny (49:44 - 49:48)
draa so you can remote too which is the (49:46 - 49:51)
other helpful thing right so like having (49:48 - 49:54)
the remote option for that is is good (49:51 - 49:56)
too um so you have like four popular (49:54 - 49:58)
like legends (49:56 - 50:01)
that will make them a ton of money you (49:58 - 50:03)
have the toxcity debut that will make (50:01 - 50:05)
them a ton of money you have a Snorlax (50:03 - 50:06)
and three stars that will make them a (50:05 - 50:08)
ton of money and that&#39;s not even (50:06 - 50:12)
touching the dmax or or gigantamax stuff (50:08 - 50:15)
yeah and again not a complaint really (50:12 - 50:18)
cool it just also seems like it kind of (50:15 - 50:20)
seems like for the first time like too (50:18 - 50:22)
much like I I think of like mle of (50:20 - 50:25)
America where there&#39;s (50:22 - 50:27)
usually seven (50:25 - 50:29)
gyms and (50:27 - 50:33)
then five to seven dmax spots cuz those (50:29 - 50:36)
can obviously change every three days (50:33 - 50:39)
mhm and it&#39;s like unless raids are going (50:36 - 50:42)
to cycle out every hour if I&#39;m just (50:39 - 50:47)
looking for Snorlax yep and those we (50:42 - 50:48)
know that Snorlax raids are going to be (50:47 - 50:50)
rarer than the others to begin with yeah (50:48 - 50:52)
yeah cuz we&#39;re not even saying like (50:50 - 50:54)
there&#39;s there&#39;s Venusaur raids Luxio (50:52 - 50:55)
raids I don&#39;t know what the other two (50:54 - 50:57)
but like who&#39;s raiding like who&#39;s who&#39;s (50:55 - 50:58)
doing a three star Venus or eight years (50:57 - 51:00)
into this game if it was wearing a (50:58 - 51:04)
jacket I would but you (51:00 - 51:04)
know like (51:05 - 51:11)
like it Niantic always does this where (51:08 - 51:14)
they like release an event and it feels (51:11 - 51:17)
so like not worth it it&#39;s like why would (51:14 - 51:18)
I buy a ticket you haven&#39;t really (51:17 - 51:20)
announced anything like even when we (51:18 - 51:21)
were talking about on the show the three (51:20 - 51:23)
of us were like it really feels like (51:21 - 51:25)
they need a Pikachu wearing a hat cuz (51:23 - 51:27)
even at that time they didn&#39;t they (51:25 - 51:28)
didn&#39;t have that and then Snorlax (51:27 - 51:31)
wearing a jacket came (51:28 - 51:31)
out so it felt like oh this is just like (51:31 - 51:35)
a really (51:34 - 51:41)
light event but this now feels like one (51:35 - 51:42)
of their biggest events they&#39;ve ever (51:41 - 51:45)
just done to have both (51:42 - 51:47)
palia (51:45 - 51:50)
and Groudon and the other one that goes (51:47 - 51:54)
with them and a new and a new gigantamax (51:50 - 51:57)
and a new Pokemon and a new egg and (51:54 - 51:59)
the leadup to this event like at the end (51:57 - 52:01)
of the day like their goal is to make a (51:59 - 52:03)
bunch of (52:01 - 52:05)
money but they put a lot into it where (52:03 - 52:08)
it&#39;s like oh I can see how you&#39;re going (52:05 - 52:10)
to get people&#39;s money (52:08 - 52:14)
now yes but and this is just one part of (52:10 - 52:15)
the event right I mean that&#39;s just we&#39;re (52:14 - 52:17)
just talking about the raid aspect (52:15 - 52:19)
unless this event is yeah we were just (52:17 - 52:21)
literally talking about the raid has (52:19 - 52:24)
just raids that&#39;s not even like the rest (52:21 - 52:25)
of the (52:24 - 52:27)
event yeah that&#39;s not even talking about (52:25 - 52:31)
how the Safari Ball is debuting and how (52:27 - 52:33)
uh they are releasing a bunch of outfits (52:31 - 52:35)
and how Rockstar and pop star Pikachu (52:33 - 52:38)
are returning and Max and then the what (52:35 - 52:40)
are they called the max Pokemon or not (52:38 - 52:43)
the max Pokemon the umy Pokemon the (52:40 - 52:44)
mighty Pokemon has that&#39;s like a whole (52:43 - 52:47)
new concept as well like yeah more (52:44 - 52:50)
likely to be XL or XXL uh more likely to (52:47 - 52:54)
have high defense attack HP they can (52:50 - 52:57)
also be shiny you can use the Safari (52:54 - 52:58)
ball to catch (52:57 - 53:01)
them just (52:58 - 53:03)
like I don&#39;t know this event kind of (53:01 - 53:05)
sounds (53:03 - 53:07)
awesome like even if you don&#39;t pay like (53:05 - 53:11)
the $10 leadup that we talked about like (53:07 - 53:13)
it genuinely feels like a weekend that (53:11 - 53:15)
you&#39;re like yes I want to take off this (53:13 - 53:17)
weekend because I want to at least do (53:15 - 53:20)
some of it yeah whereas like two months (53:17 - 53:23)
ago it was like well this this doesn&#39;t (53:20 - 53:24)
seem that (53:23 - 53:28)
great yeah yeah that&#39;s true they (53:24 - 53:30)
definitely filled it out quite a bit I I (53:28 - 53:33)
think to your point I do worry about (53:30 - 53:35)
places and this is always a concern (53:33 - 53:37)
right you can&#39;t make everyone happy (53:35 - 53:39)
either you have necrozma only in raids (53:37 - 53:42)
for two days and then people who have (53:39 - 53:44)
one po One Gym in their town are like (53:42 - 53:47)
sweet I can do the necrozma raid because (53:44 - 53:49)
it&#39;s all that&#39;s here for two days but (53:47 - 53:51)
then everybody who has 40 gyms around (53:49 - 53:53)
them is like ah it&#39;s 40 necrozma around (53:51 - 53:55)
me I don&#39;t need this many but then you (53:53 - 53:58)
can flip it the other way and you know (53:55 - 54:01)
get a nice variety of stuff in the gyms (53:58 - 54:03)
and the person with one or two gyms in (54:01 - 54:06)
their town is like well I hope that (54:03 - 54:08)
Snorlax with the jacket shows up at some (54:06 - 54:10)
point in the weekend but there are now (54:08 - 54:13)
nine different possibilities you know so (54:10 - 54:17)
it&#39;s hopefully they do rotate them out (54:13 - 54:20)
fairly frequently so that it can you (54:17 - 54:22)
know give all kinds of options to people (54:20 - 54:25)
over that two-day period of time I mean (54:22 - 54:27)
why would they not rotate them out like (54:25 - 54:30)
just rotate them out quicker like I (54:27 - 54:31)
think one of the (54:30 - 54:34)
coolest events they did and I don&#39;t even (54:31 - 54:36)
remember which one it was it was when (54:34 - 54:37)
they were like we&#39;re bringing every (54:36 - 54:39)
legendary (54:37 - 54:42)
back was that that was like a that was (54:39 - 54:45)
like a summer it was a go Fest wasn&#39;t it (54:42 - 54:48)
and there was like Beast were in the (54:45 - 54:51)
wild like Lugia and hoo were in raids (54:48 - 54:53)
Rayquaza was in raids the next day with (54:51 - 54:55)
like Hyer and Groudon I think it was (54:53 - 54:57)
maybe the first Global go I think it was (54:55 - 55:00)
the first Global go Fest yeah there was (54:57 - 55:02)
a lot of legendary Pokemon in that and (55:00 - 55:05)
it was just like really cool getting (55:02 - 55:06)
while I went to mall America it was just (55:05 - 55:07)
really cool getting to mall America and (55:06 - 55:11)
seeing like a variety of legendary (55:07 - 55:14)
Pokemon and being like don&#39;t need Kyogre (55:11 - 55:17)
gonna skip over let me go do this ho oh (55:14 - 55:20)
no one has ever said that (55:17 - 55:26)
um and then like yes seeing like suun in (55:20 - 55:29)
raicho and the wild mhm and then I think (55:26 - 55:30)
at one point in the future they did it (55:29 - 55:34)
where Latios Latios was in the wild um (55:30 - 55:36)
that was that was really cool there&#39;s (55:34 - 55:39)
like pros and cons just like you said of (55:36 - 55:41)
like only necrozma which makes it easier (55:39 - 55:44)
for what you said smaller cities with (55:41 - 55:46)
only one or two gyms and then but like (55:44 - 55:49)
when we were in New York and it just (55:46 - 55:53)
everything was necma so it was just like (55:49 - 55:55)
uh kind of nice to do something (55:53 - 55:57)
different I guess but (55:55 - 56:00)
but you know whatever (55:57 - 56:03)
yeah I just I guess my only complaint is (56:00 - 56:06)
like three stars should just be Snorlax (56:03 - 56:09)
like why why why is luxray and who&#39;s (56:06 - 56:14)
doing needs to be rare that&#39;s why yeah (56:09 - 56:16)
but also like I feel like they&#39;re (56:14 - 56:18)
they&#39;re stepping on their own toes at (56:16 - 56:20)
that point like the more Snorlax people (56:18 - 56:22)
see the more they&#39;ll do and the more (56:20 - 56:24)
money they&#39;ll make and I mean yeah this (56:22 - 56:25)
is a costume Pokemon that people clearly (56:24 - 56:28)
want yeah yeah it&#39;s a fine line though (56:25 - 56:29)
too and like cuz you also don&#39;t want to (56:28 - 56:31)
make the if you do a rotation every so (56:29 - 56:34)
often you don&#39;t want to make it too (56:31 - 56:36)
often because then people are going to (56:34 - 56:37)
be like well I don&#39;t have time to get (56:36 - 56:39)
people like for the five star raids it&#39;s (56:37 - 56:40)
like we don&#39;t have enough time to know (56:39 - 56:42)
to go do the raid because we only have (56:40 - 56:44)
like 15 minutes and then it&#39;s a new (56:42 - 56:45)
Pokemon like there was a time when it (56:44 - 56:48)
was like 20 minutes rotating for Pokemon (56:45 - 56:51)
or something like that wasn&#39;t it like m (56:48 - 56:53)
i remember one one of the events they (56:51 - 56:55)
were rotating really quickly uh but (56:53 - 56:56)
there was only like two or something (56:55 - 56:58)
that were out so it was like okay well (56:56 - 56:59)
you know you can catch the next one (56:58 - 57:03)
maybe um so it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely a fine (56:59 - 57:06)
line um I feel like they need to make (57:03 - 57:08)
Snorlax rare because that&#39;s what they do (57:06 - 57:12)
but I feel like when they had cowboy hat (57:08 - 57:16)
Snorlax that wasn&#39;t that rare but I I (57:12 - 57:17)
can&#39;t remember I think it was in the (57:16 - 57:20)
wild too it was okay because I I feel (57:17 - 57:22)
like I came away from that whatever I (57:20 - 57:25)
got I got a bunch in Seattle well I (57:22 - 57:27)
guess that was in person I got a even (57:25 - 57:30)
the came away with a lot of them I feel (57:27 - 57:33)
like um but these aren&#39;t the jacket ones (57:30 - 57:36)
aren&#39;t in the wild huh they&#39;re just (57:33 - 57:40)
raids yep (57:36 - 57:42)
yeah they learned their lesson they&#39;re (57:40 - 57:44)
like we can put we can we can put a (57:42 - 57:48)
dollar pay wall on this and it&#39;ll be (57:44 - 57:51)
fine um yeah I mean at the time of (57:48 - 57:53)
recording I I will still be in Japan for (57:51 - 57:57)
this because as (57:53 - 57:59)
my my option was Mall of America or (57:57 - 58:03)
nothing because it is November in the (57:59 - 58:06)
midwest that&#39;s not like I can&#39;t let&#39;s go (58:03 - 58:08)
down to the park no it&#39;ll be way too (58:06 - 58:13)
cold for eight hours uh so I added some (58:08 - 58:16)
time to then find a place in Japan also (58:13 - 58:18)
like every time I&#39;ve been in Japan the (58:16 - 58:21)
one Community day that was I had to like (58:18 - 58:23)
play in Japan was the same time as the (58:21 - 58:27)
world championship finals so it&#39;s like (58:23 - 58:29)
guess I&#39;m not playing commun day here I (58:27 - 58:34)
suppose that sucks yeah so I I guess (58:29 - 58:36)
I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll be (58:34 - 58:40)
streaming the global while in Japan and (58:36 - 58:43)
I&#39;m very curious how that (58:40 - 58:48)
goes yeah that should be interesting for (58:43 - 58:51)
sure but also like still the risk of (58:48 - 58:52)
weather (58:51 - 58:55)
but of course anywhere for Pokemon go (58:52 - 58:58)
with weather yeah there are also places (58:55 - 59:00)
like in Tokyo or in wherever you are in (58:58 - 59:01)
Japan I&#39;m assuming Tokyo but there you (59:00 - 59:04)
can go to different like indoor places (59:01 - 59:09)
as well so that is possible but um yeah (59:04 - 59:11)
always a good time playing in Japan yeah (59:09 - 59:13)
so much (59:11 - 59:15)
happening um seems like a good event (59:13 - 59:17)
though but uh I get we&#39;ll talk about it (59:15 - 59:21)
when I get back from Japan of how this (59:17 - 59:24)
in-person plus this Global event (59:21 - 59:27)
feels uh and it really does seem (59:24 - 59:30)
like there will be a Unova (59:27 - 59:34)
tour and Unova tour will be (59:30 - 59:37)
like okay we we did the we did the (59:34 - 59:38)
kyogre&#39;s we did the Palos you&#39;re not (59:37 - 59:40)
going to see them now for a while they (59:38 - 59:42)
got their they got their (59:40 - 59:45)
time and now we&#39;re GNA focus on the rush (59:42 - 59:47)
Rams the (59:45 - 59:49)
kums well they got they got to (59:47 - 59:51)
re-release the black and white right oh (59:49 - 59:52)
yeah (59:51 - 59:54)
accidentally which well there&#39;s no way (59:52 - 59:57)
they don&#39;t have venture yeah yeah so (59:54 - 59:59)
it&#39;s like here are your here are your (59:57 - 60:01)
two Pokemon with Adventure effects you (59:59 - 60:02)
got them twice this year you&#39;re probably (60:01 - 60:04)
not going to see them for a (60:02 - 60:08)
while because we&#39;re doing rusham and Kyo (60:04 - 60:10)
we&#39;re doing rusham and z rusham and (60:08 - 60:13)
Kyogre my favorite combo blue kierum (60:10 - 60:16)
kyre fused with (60:13 - 60:20)
kierum uh I mean five does come after (60:16 - 60:21)
four so it would make sense that you (60:20 - 60:23)
knowa tour would be the year after the c (60:21 - 60:25)
tour which was the year after the hoen (60:23 - 60:27)
tour yes you&#39;d think I would be (60:25 - 60:29)
hilarious if they did like a Kos tour (60:27 - 60:32)
next year they just do Kanto tour (60:29 - 60:36)
they&#39;re like ah it&#39;s been long (60:32 - 60:39)
enough you all like Bulbasaur right (60:36 - 60:41)
that&#39;s why Bulbasaur is not featured (60:39 - 60:43)
here they&#39;re saving it for the Kanto (60:41 - 60:45)
tour in (60:43 - 60:48)
February Perfect all right uh let&#39;s take (60:45 - 60:50)
one more break and then we&#39;ll uh talk (60:48 - 60:53)
about pocket we&#39;ll be right (60:50 - 60:53)
back and we are back from our break all (60:53 - 61:00)
right we talked a lot of pocket last (60:57 - 61:01)
week I mean like last week&#39;s episode (61:00 - 61:03)
could have been like three hours long of (61:01 - 61:06)
pocket so we go like we got to space it (61:03 - 61:10)
out uh this this week we again we still (61:06 - 61:11)
have to space it out because we could (61:10 - 61:16)
easily make the segment 90 minutes long (61:11 - 61:19)
um I want I want to focus on just like (61:16 - 61:22)
the battling part cuz Hannah went (61:19 - 61:26)
from not super interested to like (61:22 - 61:28)
getting get ready for the Pocket World (61:26 - 61:30)
Championships no not that I still can&#39;t (61:28 - 61:33)
even talk about the battles very much (61:30 - 61:36)
like I&#39;m operating purely on Vibes is (61:33 - 61:39)
what I&#39;ve been saying oh okay okay that (61:36 - 61:41)
can I talk about individual cards and (61:39 - 61:43)
putting together a deck well no but am I (61:41 - 61:47)
winning yeah and it&#39;s (61:43 - 61:49)
fun did you did you play any like (61:47 - 61:51)
traditional (61:49 - 61:55)
TCG I played TCG with one of my friends (61:51 - 61:58)
in college okay so like go to like (61:55 - 62:01)
Target and buy like a battle deck no I (61:58 - 62:03)
just used his decks we would just sit (62:01 - 62:06)
down and play Pokemon for a little bit (62:03 - 62:07)
every couple of (62:06 - 62:11)
weeks um and that&#39;s that&#39;s most of my (62:07 - 62:14)
playing TCG (62:11 - 62:14)
experience Bobby you&#39;re not you&#39;re not (62:15 - 62:19)
hitting up tournaments every (62:17 - 62:24)
weekend um uh as a kid when it was just (62:19 - 62:27)
Bas set in Jungle pretty much and fossil (62:24 - 62:31)
I did tournaments um and played the TCG (62:27 - 62:35)
then when I was younger um in the recent (62:31 - 62:39)
years I&#39;ve taught I taught my son how to (62:35 - 62:41)
play and my wife actually we all played (62:39 - 62:45)
a little bit um and then I played some (62:41 - 62:46)
uh TCG (62:45 - 62:48)
online because I wasn&#39;t doing like (62:46 - 62:52)
inperson stuff but then I I dropped off (62:48 - 62:54)
of that like and then when I went to TCG (62:52 - 62:56)
live you know I was like oh this will be (62:54 - 62:58)
great I can play it on my phone finally (62:56 - 63:00)
and then I was like can barely play it (62:58 - 63:03)
on my phone finally yeah so never really (63:00 - 63:06)
got into TCG live but definitely play no (63:03 - 63:09)
one&#39;s truly playing TCG live I&#39;m sure (63:06 - 63:10)
there&#39;s like five people out there they (63:09 - 63:13)
all battle each other every (63:10 - 63:17)
day when it works oh (63:13 - 63:17)
no um yeah I think maybe maybe if (63:19 - 63:25)
somebody&#39;s a newer listener they they (63:23 - 63:26)
might not know but if You&#39; listening to (63:25 - 63:30)
the show for literally like a month well (63:26 - 63:33)
maybe not um I like a lot of early (63:30 - 63:35)
episodes of the show was very TCG (63:33 - 63:39)
focused because me and will uh would go (63:35 - 63:42)
to a lot of tournaments and that&#39;s when (63:39 - 63:43)
that would be like the only time I would (63:42 - 63:45)
see will is like at a regionals or a (63:43 - 63:47)
Nationals or something because will (63:45 - 63:49)
would play locally in DC and then I (63:47 - 63:51)
would play locally in like the Milwaukee (63:49 - 63:53)
and Chicago area I think I had way more (63:51 - 63:56)
places to play just because I was (63:53 - 63:59)
between two big cities um but I think (63:56 - 64:01)
sometimes will would drive out to go to (63:59 - 64:03)
a tournament (64:01 - 64:06)
and uh yeah and then I would like the (64:03 - 64:09)
first time I saw Will was at (64:06 - 64:11)
Indiana National that was like the first (64:09 - 64:15)
time we met and everything so yeah I I (64:11 - 64:18)
played pretty much fulltime every single (64:15 - 64:22)
weekend competitively for three (64:18 - 64:26)
years uh so I I feel like I like the TC (64:22 - 64:32)
CG a lot um and part of the reason I (64:26 - 64:35)
stopped playing was incredibly time (64:32 - 64:38)
consuming I think any any like (64:35 - 64:40)
competitive thing is just super time (64:38 - 64:41)
like (64:40 - 64:43)
like (64:41 - 64:46)
uh sjin Park is not just rolling out of (64:43 - 64:48)
bed and being like yep I won a World (64:46 - 64:51)
Tournament with pisu like he&#39;s probably (64:48 - 64:53)
playing multiple matches every single (64:51 - 64:57)
day leading up to that that (64:53 - 64:59)
Victory maybe I don&#39;t know maybe the (64:57 - 65:00)
dude&#39;s very talented maybe he did just (64:59 - 65:02)
roll out of bed and win with pesu I (65:00 - 65:04)
don&#39;t think so (65:02 - 65:07)
um the other thing is like the cool (65:04 - 65:09)
thing about the TCG is it changes every (65:07 - 65:11)
three months like new cards come in (65:09 - 65:14)
format changes the bad thing about that (65:11 - 65:17)
is sometimes the Decks that you liked or (65:14 - 65:19)
the money that you put in is no longer (65:17 - 65:23)
good so I I stopped playing when I got (65:19 - 65:26)
into playing with the end of heart gold (65:23 - 65:28)
soul silver which was the start of black (65:26 - 65:30)
and white which was like Noble Victors (65:28 - 65:34)
and and uh merging powers and all those (65:30 - 65:38)
sets and then I stopped playing near the (65:34 - 65:40)
end of black and white like literally (65:38 - 65:42)
right before X and Y and that was like (65:40 - 65:45)
furbank City gym and hypnotoxic Laser (65:42 - 65:48)
and I was like I&#39;m I&#39;m done don&#39;t don&#39;t (65:45 - 65:50)
want to play against this anymore uh I (65:48 - 65:53)
already feel like I have the I don&#39;t (65:50 - 65:55)
want to play against this anymore in (65:53 - 65:58)
pocket and I think a lot of people have (65:55 - 66:00)
that as well so at least from what I&#39;ve (65:58 - 66:03)
seen in conversations online is people (66:00 - 66:06)
do not want to play against (66:03 - 66:10)
Mewtwo that is like somebody goes up and (66:06 - 66:12)
they flip a RS in a Mewtwo and they&#39;re (66:10 - 66:14)
like I&#39;ll just concede like I&#39;m I don&#39;t (66:12 - 66:18)
want to play this which I don&#39;t think (66:14 - 66:20)
Mewtwo is a (66:18 - 66:24)
problem uh I my problem and the I don&#39;t (66:20 - 66:27)
want to play this is against Articuno (66:24 - 66:30)
and Misty yeah and usually you don&#39;t (66:27 - 66:32)
have to concede because what will happen (66:30 - 66:34)
is they will Play Misty they will (66:32 - 66:36)
immediately flip tails and then they (66:34 - 66:38)
will concede and that feels very good (66:36 - 66:40)
it&#39;s a quick match (66:38 - 66:45)
[Laughter] (66:40 - 66:48)
usually um yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s uh there (66:45 - 66:51)
is a big difference between the (66:48 - 66:53)
traditional card (66:51 - 66:57)
game six take six prizes have six prizes (66:53 - 67:01)
60 card decks versus pocket which is no (66:57 - 67:03)
prizes 20 card decks energy is not even (67:01 - 67:06)
in the deck (67:03 - 67:09)
um and there&#39;s not a lot of cards in the (67:06 - 67:11)
game right now I think there&#39;s what like (67:09 - 67:14)
240 cards or something if you&#39;re (67:11 - 67:16)
counting the secrets something like that (67:14 - 67:21)
some somewhere 3250 the the best deck as (67:16 - 67:24)
of recording this podcast is variations (67:21 - 67:28)
of Pikachu EX so usually that is two (67:24 - 67:32)
Pikachu EX two Zapdos EX and then a (67:28 - 67:34)
combination of different electric (67:32 - 67:37)
Pokemon so that might be electrode that (67:34 - 67:41)
might be uh Zeb strika that might be (67:37 - 67:42)
baby (67:41 - 67:47)
zaptos um but I don&#39;t feel like Pikachu (67:42 - 67:50)
gets as much hate as Mewtwo because (67:47 - 67:54)
Pikachu can be different like some are (67:50 - 67:55)
running Zera and some are running (67:54 - 67:58)
Electric and some don&#39;t have two Zapdos (67:55 - 68:01)
EX they only have one Zapdos EX where (67:58 - 68:03)
Mewtwo has to (68:01 - 68:08)
be two meww Ex two Ralts two klia two (68:03 - 68:11)
gavor MH and that&#39;s it and sometimes (68:08 - 68:13)
there&#39;s a Meowth sometimes there&#39;s a (68:11 - 68:16)
fossil sometimes there&#39;s a Kangas scan (68:13 - 68:19)
but like the core of that deck is I need (68:16 - 68:22)
to set up my gavor I need to set up my (68:19 - 68:25)
Mewtwo as somebody who has the Mewtwo (68:22 - 68:26)
deck (68:25 - 68:28)
I play Meowth by the way I don&#39;t play (68:26 - 68:30)
the (68:28 - 68:30)
fossil I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as (68:30 - 68:37)
good as the people who see it and go (68:33 - 68:38)
like I don&#39;t want to play against this I (68:37 - 68:41)
don&#39;t I truly don&#39;t think it&#39;s like that (68:38 - 68:43)
good I think one Pikachu is a much (68:41 - 68:46)
better deck I think Pikachu is much more (68:43 - 68:49)
consistent and I think Pikachu is easier (68:46 - 68:52)
to play but I don&#39;t again I don&#39;t think (68:49 - 68:53)
Pikachu gets the hate because you&#39;ll (68:52 - 68:55)
sometimes you&#39;ll see an Electabuzz in (68:53 - 68:57)
Pikachu sometimes you&#39;ll see a pinch and (68:55 - 68:59)
Pikachu is like a lot easier to build (68:57 - 69:02)
because you can just like fill it out (68:59 - 69:03)
with other electric Pokemon that are (69:02 - 69:07)
like kind of okay yeah so those are like (69:03 - 69:09)
the two best decks then you have all the (69:07 - 69:12)
water decks which rely on Misty and (69:09 - 69:15)
that&#39;s going to be mostly (69:12 - 69:17)
Articuno you&#39;re maybe not going to see (69:15 - 69:20)
Blastoise but it works the same with (69:17 - 69:23)
Misty I think star me in itself even (69:20 - 69:27)
without Misty is a crazy good card and (69:23 - 69:29)
it&#39;s that that&#39;s what blows me away (69:27 - 69:32)
about like Articuno players is like even (69:29 - 69:34)
if you missed your Misty like Star me is (69:32 - 69:39)
so easy to set up and so good in general (69:34 - 69:41)
is it that it&#39;s crazy that they&#39;ll just (69:39 - 69:44)
concede is it because you have to get (69:41 - 69:46)
it&#39;s two steps to get to star me versus (69:44 - 69:49)
like Articuno is just a basic so you can (69:46 - 69:50)
pull it with a Pokeball and then you&#39;re (69:49 - 69:53)
getting it right into your hand whereas (69:50 - 69:54)
like Star me it&#39;s like you have to draw (69:53 - 69:57)
a star me then put it on a staru then (69:54 - 69:59)
get the two energy or what however order (69:57 - 70:03)
you do that in you know like I just I (69:59 - 70:06)
feel like Star me is a is a great card (70:03 - 70:10)
like no retreat cost 90 damage for two (70:06 - 70:13)
energy got 130 hit point like it&#39;s like (70:10 - 70:17)
that&#39;s a great card no it is and I am (70:13 - 70:20)
surprised I don&#39;t see it more often like (70:17 - 70:22)
I do see a lot of Articuno but yeah I&#39;ve (70:20 - 70:24)
I&#39;m rarely coming up against the star me (70:22 - 70:26)
EX unless you&#39;re playing the lapers (70:24 - 70:29)
event against the computer well art I (70:26 - 70:31)
think the problem with Articuno and why (70:29 - 70:33)
I don&#39;t like it is because it kind of (70:31 - 70:36)
breaks the rules of the game and that&#39;s (70:33 - 70:40)
why it&#39;s annoying to me so like there&#39;s (70:36 - 70:42)
a big conversation of whether going (70:40 - 70:48)
first is actually bad yep yep um and (70:42 - 70:51)
there was so when (70:48 - 70:54)
I back in my day when I was playing the (70:51 - 70:57)
TCG in person there was something called (70:54 - 71:00)
donking where you could donk your (70:57 - 71:03)
opponent and so how the TCG works is (71:00 - 71:07)
turn one is technically turn zero for (71:03 - 71:09)
you so if you&#39;re going first it&#39;s turn (71:07 - 71:10)
zero and then your opponent is actually (71:09 - 71:14)
it&#39;s their first turn MH and back in (71:10 - 71:17)
haril silver and early black and white (71:14 - 71:20)
people would build Decks that would donk (71:17 - 71:22)
you which would mean that you lose (71:20 - 71:25)
before turn one and a really popular (71:22 - 71:28)
card to donk was torn uh Tornadus (71:25 - 71:30)
because you could you could set a double (71:28 - 71:32)
colorless you could move some stuff (71:30 - 71:34)
around you could get one more energy on (71:32 - 71:36)
Tornadus and then you could do like 80 (71:34 - 71:38)
damage on turn one and if they just (71:36 - 71:39)
started with (71:38 - 71:45)
a 60 HP Abra like they lost before they (71:39 - 71:47)
could do anything so that would be a (71:45 - 71:49)
donk like they didn&#39;t even have a chance (71:47 - 71:54)
to play the game uh and that&#39;s and so (71:49 - 71:56)
they had to change rules (71:54 - 71:59)
to be like okay well either you can&#39;t (71:56 - 72:00)
attack on the first turn or you can&#39;t (71:59 - 72:03)
play a supporter on the first turn (72:00 - 72:07)
or There are rules because stat (72:03 - 72:09)
statistically if you went (72:07 - 72:12)
first as long if if both players were of (72:09 - 72:16)
equal skill level but one but but (72:12 - 72:18)
whoever went first had such an advantage (72:16 - 72:22)
of winning purely ongoing first so their (72:18 - 72:23)
their whole goal and of course this (72:22 - 72:25)
exist in Magic and Yu-Gi-Oh and stuff (72:23 - 72:28)
their whole goal was how can we make (72:25 - 72:34)
turn zero feel fair to both players but (72:28 - 72:37)
also not make it feel (72:34 - 72:40)
worse and that&#39;s clear of what they were (72:37 - 72:42)
trying to achieve in (72:40 - 72:47)
pocket so you cannot attach an energy on (72:42 - 72:51)
turn zero in pocket but you can play a (72:47 - 72:54)
supporter and you can play your item (72:51 - 72:58)
cards and you can can technically attack (72:54 - 73:01)
but the rule is you cannot play an (72:58 - 73:05)
energy going first so Misty kind of (73:01 - 73:08)
breaks that so if somebody starts with (73:05 - 73:11)
an Articuno and they play Misty which is (73:08 - 73:12)
their one supporter they&#39;re allowed to (73:11 - 73:15)
play and they can attach two to three (73:12 - 73:20)
energy now they get to attack you before (73:15 - 73:22)
you even get to play which is I (73:20 - 73:24)
fundamentally I think what they were (73:22 - 73:25)
trying to prevent they were like you go (73:24 - 73:28)
first but you don&#39;t get to attack (73:25 - 73:33)
MH and you can get donked in Pocket by (73:28 - 73:36)
pretty much any water deck but Articuno (73:33 - 73:39)
is the best one that does that right um (73:36 - 73:42)
so there have been matches where it&#39;s (73:39 - 73:44)
like literally the the game is (73:42 - 73:46)
determined by a coin flip not the coin (73:44 - 73:49)
flip of starting the game but like if (73:46 - 73:50)
they get three (73:49 - 73:53)
energies they ultimately won before I (73:50 - 73:56)
even get to start and if they F the coin (73:53 - 73:59)
and get no energies they almost always (73:56 - 74:03)
concede because that was like their and (73:59 - 74:06)
and that&#39;s why like back in the day donk (74:03 - 74:09)
decks didn&#39;t win tournaments right they (74:06 - 74:12)
only won like the first couple matches (74:09 - 74:15)
because they&#39;re so incredibly in no I&#39;ll (74:12 - 74:17)
be the first to say when you donk (74:15 - 74:21)
somebody fa feels really good like not (74:17 - 74:24)
like one the match is over you won and (74:21 - 74:27)
now you got like 30 minutes to be like (74:24 - 74:29)
oh I can go get like a p slice of pizza (74:27 - 74:30)
as everyone else is still playing it (74:29 - 74:32)
felt great like there&#39;s a reason dun but (74:30 - 74:36)
you almost never saw donk decks like win (74:32 - 74:39)
an entire tournament yeah well I mean (74:36 - 74:41)
and in the case of Misty and Articuno (74:39 - 74:44)
and I know it&#39;s a popular deck I I it&#39;s (74:41 - 74:45)
a very popular (74:44 - 74:49)
deck to do that you also have to get (74:45 - 74:53)
heads to go first you have to have Misty (74:49 - 74:55)
be one of the cards that pops up at (74:53 - 74:57)
first for you or you pull a professor&#39;s (74:55 - 74:59)
research and you know it becomes one of (74:57 - 75:01)
those two cards oh no because it&#39;s a (74:59 - 75:02)
supporter right so if you do the (75:01 - 75:03)
professor&#39;s research there&#39;s no Misty (75:02 - 75:05)
you can&#39;t use Misti so it&#39;s got to pop (75:03 - 75:08)
okay so you gotta heads to go first it&#39;s (75:05 - 75:10)
got to pop up in the first cards that (75:08 - 75:13)
you draw you then have to get three more (75:10 - 75:17)
heads in a row yep to put (75:13 - 75:19)
the and you have to have hope the (75:17 - 75:21)
Articuno popped up or if you have a (75:19 - 75:23)
Pokeball that pops up then brings you (75:21 - 75:26)
Articuno there&#39;s like a lot of luck that (75:23 - 75:28)
goes into that process working (75:26 - 75:31)
completely to your point as to why like (75:28 - 75:35)
I feel like it&#39;s very Hit or Miss like I (75:31 - 75:37)
I just feel like it&#39;s so scattered with (75:35 - 75:41)
like how well that can work (75:37 - 75:43)
unless unless the coin flips aren&#39;t (75:41 - 75:46)
50/50 but that&#39;s like then going a whole (75:43 - 75:47)
different I don&#39;t think the game is like (75:46 - 75:50)
cheating coin flips I think either (75:47 - 75:52)
Articuno I think the Articuno situation (75:50 - 75:55)
gets worse when if they if they end up (75:52 - 75:57)
adding more trainers cuz one of the (75:55 - 76:00)
variations of Articuno is two (75:57 - 76:03)
articunos and then 18 trainer cards yes (76:00 - 76:04)
so you&#39;re definitely starting with (76:03 - 76:07)
Articuno and your Pokeball is definitely (76:04 - 76:09)
getting you your other (76:07 - 76:13)
Articuno um and you have a pretty like (76:09 - 76:14)
when you&#39;re only running two articunos (76:13 - 76:16)
and 18 trainers you have a pretty high (76:14 - 76:19)
chance of starting with Misty in your (76:16 - 76:22)
hand so actually actually this brings up (76:19 - 76:25)
a good point um how does pocket Det (76:22 - 76:27)
determine that you&#39;re going to end up (76:25 - 76:29)
with at least one Basic Pokemon on your (76:27 - 76:31)
initial draw there is no (76:29 - 76:34)
penalty so like in you just draw again (76:31 - 76:36)
like I&#39;ve never seen it where there&#39;s (76:34 - 76:39)
not it doesn&#39;t do an animation for it oh (76:36 - 76:42)
okay okay like that that whole part you (76:39 - 76:44)
know how it searches a Pokemon in your (76:42 - 76:45)
deck and you don&#39;t see what it&#39;s looking (76:44 - 76:47)
at it&#39;s the same thing at the start of (76:45 - 76:49)
the game so in like the traditional TCG (76:47 - 76:53)
if I just ran four tans this was a real (76:49 - 76:55)
deck in black and white it was just four (76:53 - 76:57)
four tans that was it out of 60 cards (76:55 - 76:59)
you ran four Pokemon and then the and (76:57 - 77:01)
then you ran 10 energy and then you ran (76:59 - 77:04)
like 40 trainer cards that was a real (77:01 - 77:08)
deck it was awesome it was it it was (77:04 - 77:10)
fantastic but the problem with that deck (77:08 - 77:13)
is you would draw no Pokemon and then (77:10 - 77:16)
your opponent got a like an extra card (77:13 - 77:17)
at the start of their turn every time (77:16 - 77:19)
you didn&#39;t draw a (77:17 - 77:23)
Pokemon um actually I think a deck won (77:19 - 77:24)
the World Championships that was just (77:23 - 77:26)
four (77:24 - 77:28)
iron Thorns that&#39;s all it was was four (77:26 - 77:30)
iron Thorns I think I won the World (77:28 - 77:33)
Championship um same thing like every (77:30 - 77:35)
time they didn&#39;t draw Iron Thorns their (77:33 - 77:36)
opponent got to draw a card so (77:35 - 77:38)
ultimately Articuno is that but you (77:36 - 77:40)
never see that there&#39;s one there&#39;s no (77:38 - 77:43)
like oh you didn&#39;t draw an Articuno I (77:40 - 77:45)
get a bonus card that doesn&#39;t exist in (77:43 - 77:47)
this game right okay uh so there&#39;s like (77:45 - 77:51)
no penalty for doing that sure (77:47 - 77:56)
um but like it&#39;s it&#39;s clear to me (77:51 - 77:58)
that (77:56 - 78:00)
they I don&#39;t know if I completely agree (77:58 - 78:03)
with going first is the (78:00 - 78:07)
worst because you get to evolve (78:03 - 78:10)
sooner and that is very good especially (78:07 - 78:12)
if you&#39;re running something like gavor (78:10 - 78:14)
like if you get your gavor out first and (78:12 - 78:16)
gavor is getting you energy you&#39;re (78:14 - 78:18)
winning the energy game and you can only (78:16 - 78:20)
do that by going first obviously (78:18 - 78:21)
assuming that you have the cards you (78:20 - 78:23)
need to have yeah but that&#39;s a fairly (78:21 - 78:25)
rare instance (78:23 - 78:27)
like usually even if you can evolve (78:25 - 78:29)
first you don&#39;t have the opportunity to (78:27 - 78:31)
get the energy you need to run the (78:29 - 78:33)
evolved Pokemon well Gore is special (78:31 - 78:35)
because that&#39;s why I said it was a (78:33 - 78:38)
different yeah fa rare I think it&#39;s a (78:35 - 78:42)
rare instance because the deck that is (78:38 - 78:45)
more consistent and good is Pikachu and (78:42 - 78:47)
you don&#39;t need to evolve Pikachu yeah (78:45 - 78:51)
and so like your the thing you have to (78:47 - 78:54)
evolve is like electrode or Ze strika (78:51 - 78:56)
but those are sit situational cards of (78:54 - 78:58)
like I need the up Striker to like close (78:56 - 79:00)
out the game or I&#39;m I just really need (78:58 - 79:02)
electrode for like the free Retreat so (79:00 - 79:05)
when I just promote electrode fix my (79:02 - 79:08)
bench Retreat electrode promote what I (79:05 - 79:11)
want so like they&#39;re not needed we like (79:08 - 79:13)
you could I guess you could argue gavor (79:11 - 79:16)
is not needed for me too but I I if if (79:13 - 79:18)
we lived in a format right now which we (79:16 - 79:23)
don&#39;t where evolving was necessary and (79:18 - 79:26)
important you would want to go first but (79:23 - 79:28)
I think that&#39;s why people feel like (79:26 - 79:30)
going first is so bad because no one&#39;s (79:28 - 79:32)
playing Evolutions they&#39;re just playing (79:30 - 79:33)
two articunos they&#39;re just playing two (79:32 - 79:35)
Pikachus some people are just playing (79:33 - 79:37)
two meww like I don&#39;t have Gore but meww (79:35 - 79:39)
is still good enough so that&#39;s the (79:37 - 79:41)
that&#39;s the thing right like there&#39;s (79:39 - 79:44)
there&#39;s so many Basic Pokemon that do so (79:41 - 79:46)
much already that when you when you have (79:44 - 79:49)
like a Blastoise deck or a Charizard (79:46 - 79:51)
deck or Venusaur it&#39;s like you got to (79:49 - 79:53)
get it to Venusaur you got to get it to (79:51 - 79:55)
Charizard and there&#39;s all these there&#39;s (79:53 - 79:57)
all these decks right now where to your (79:55 - 80:00)
point like Pikachu is just out just (79:57 - 80:05)
working like yeah in you know this I I I (80:00 - 80:08)
I don&#39;t think going first is as bad as (80:05 - 80:10)
people (80:08 - 80:13)
say in (80:10 - 80:15)
theory the problem right now is we just (80:13 - 80:18)
don&#39;t have cards that reward you to (80:15 - 80:19)
evolve and that&#39;s why people are just (80:18 - 80:21)
like I&#39;m just going to run to Articuno (80:19 - 80:22)
and if I win the coin flip I win the (80:21 - 80:25)
game and that&#39;s over as fast like I I (80:22 - 80:27)
totally get why people would be like oh (80:25 - 80:29)
I didn&#39;t hit my coin flips I&#39;ll just (80:27 - 80:31)
concede and do it again like because the (80:29 - 80:33)
barrier to entry is so low but the (80:31 - 80:35)
second they introduced rare candy the (80:33 - 80:37)
second they introduce a Pokeball where I (80:35 - 80:40)
can search out a middle Evolution there (80:37 - 80:42)
was a very popular card during black and (80:40 - 80:43)
white I think even before black and (80:42 - 80:45)
white called computer search which was (80:43 - 80:48)
just take a Pokemon in your hand and (80:45 - 80:50)
switch out with a Pokemon in your deck (80:48 - 80:52)
so it&#39;s like cool I got a volt orb don&#39;t (80:50 - 80:53)
need the Voltorb I&#39;m going to switch it (80:52 - 80:55)
out for klia okay now now I can evolve (80:53 - 80:58)
my RS there&#39;s nothing in the game right (80:55 - 81:00)
now (80:58 - 81:04)
to reward you or to like benefit you to (81:00 - 81:06)
Evol to have like a Blastoise line or a (81:04 - 81:08)
Charizard line or (81:06 - 81:11)
a whatever other like Alakazam or (81:08 - 81:14)
Machamp you can still do it right yeah (81:11 - 81:17)
and that&#39;s that&#39;s fine and usually like (81:14 - 81:18)
maybe I would maybe say like Venusaur is (81:17 - 81:22)
probably the best stage two uh because (81:18 - 81:24)
Venusaur pairs really well with Erica (81:22 - 81:28)
for like the healing mhm um (81:24 - 81:32)
but I&#39;m almost positive that they don&#39;t (81:28 - 81:36)
want player one to attack on turn one to (81:32 - 81:39)
make it fair but Misty breaks that (81:36 - 81:42)
entire thing yeah and (81:39 - 81:45)
so I wonder (81:42 - 81:48)
if (81:45 - 81:50)
one (81:48 - 81:53)
they fix that where like yeah you can (81:50 - 81:56)
attach the energy but you still can&#39;t (81:53 - 81:57)
attack because we just didn&#39;t want (81:56 - 82:00)
people to attack on turn one or they (81:57 - 82:03)
actually change (82:00 - 82:06)
cards like it&#39;s a digital only game and (82:03 - 82:09)
these cards aren&#39;t real cards like (82:06 - 82:11)
Pokeball doesn&#39;t do what it does in this (82:09 - 82:14)
game that it does in real life (82:11 - 82:16)
yeahuh um cuz in real life you got to (82:14 - 82:18)
flip a coin if heads then you get to (82:16 - 82:19)
search for a Pokemon in this game it&#39;s (82:18 - 82:21)
just we&#39;ll randomly get you a (82:19 - 82:25)
Pokemon so like do they do do they make (82:21 - 82:28)
adjustments do they go (82:25 - 82:31)
like 80% of all MTI players are (82:28 - 82:33)
conceding after turn one because they&#39;re (82:31 - 82:34)
not getting heads but also like the ones (82:33 - 82:36)
that aren&#39;t conceding are guaranteed to (82:34 - 82:38)
win like they have to have those (82:36 - 82:41)
statistics like I I think Misty is the (82:38 - 82:44)
worst card in the game because it it (82:41 - 82:46)
breaks the rules of the game it does (82:44 - 82:48)
break the rules of the game I don&#39;t (82:46 - 82:51)
think they will I have I&#39;m not I have (82:48 - 82:52)
nothing to go off of this I actually (82:51 - 82:55)
have not played other on online or (82:52 - 82:59)
digital only like card games I just feel (82:55 - 83:02)
based on how the TCG goes like I don&#39;t (82:59 - 83:04)
think they&#39;re going to change a card (83:02 - 83:07)
that is already out there now I could (83:04 - 83:12)
see them like I I think instead they (83:07 - 83:14)
they bring out a card that somehow (83:12 - 83:16)
counters that in some way that makes (83:14 - 83:19)
that card less like powerful or (83:16 - 83:21)
something or they change a mechanic of (83:19 - 83:23)
the game like like okay you don&#39;t attack (83:21 - 83:25)
on turn one or something like that (83:23 - 83:29)
rather than actually change the move the (83:25 - 83:31)
card has again I&#39;m not I don&#39;t not like (83:29 - 83:33)
I don&#39;t really have anything I&#39;m going (83:31 - 83:34)
off of on that I just think that they (83:33 - 83:36)
wouldn&#39;t do that I think they would do (83:34 - 83:38)
something else to even it out rather (83:36 - 83:39)
than change something that&#39;s already in (83:38 - 83:42)
game yeah I could imagine them changing (83:39 - 83:44)
the rules but changing the actual cards (83:42 - 83:46)
even though it&#39;s possible feels like (83:44 - 83:49)
something that would get a lot of push (83:46 - 83:51)
back but I don&#39;t know I I also haven&#39;t (83:49 - 83:53)
played digital card games very much like (83:51 - 83:57)
this I think you get less push back from (83:53 - 84:00)
the community if you change other things (83:57 - 84:03)
about the game to even it out rather (84:00 - 84:06)
than change a card that people have (84:03 - 84:09)
like I it feels different than if you&#39;re (84:06 - 84:12)
investing into getting that card that (84:09 - 84:14)
that card itself completely changes (84:12 - 84:15)
because it&#39;s like well I invested in (84:14 - 84:18)
that card like build it out so that it (84:15 - 84:20)
makes it like Pokemon unite they (84:18 - 84:22)
rebalance Pokemon all the time so I see (84:20 - 84:25)
where the idea comes from okay (84:22 - 84:27)
I knew this conversation was going to (84:25 - 84:30)
come up they did do this in real (84:27 - 84:34)
life so in black and white they (84:30 - 84:37)
introduced a card called Pokemon (84:34 - 84:41)
catcher and it worked like Sabrina you (84:37 - 84:45)
except you get to pick so I want to you (84:41 - 84:49)
got that Stu on the bench with 10 HP I&#39;m (84:45 - 84:51)
going to play Pokemon catcher okay that (84:49 - 84:53)
is now active I&#39;m going to knock it out (84:51 - 84:57)
and I win the game it was a trainer (84:53 - 85:00)
card I could play four in a turn if I (84:57 - 85:03)
wanted to was not a supporter they (85:00 - 85:07)
changed it to be a coin (85:03 - 85:12)
flip so in X and Y A couple sets later (85:07 - 85:14)
it was the same exact card they changed (85:12 - 85:16)
the text to say You must flip a coin if (85:14 - 85:20)
heads now you can play this same title (85:16 - 85:22)
same image but they added that extra (85:20 - 85:24)
line of dialogue so all of the old (85:22 - 85:25)
catcher (85:24 - 85:28)
even the gold secret catcher that they (85:25 - 85:31)
released was now useless because they (85:28 - 85:33)
changed the text okay and then they went (85:31 - 85:36)
a step further and they got rid of that (85:33 - 85:37)
card completely and they introduced (85:36 - 85:41)
boss&#39;s orders which was the original (85:37 - 85:43)
catcher of you get to pick exactly what (85:41 - 85:45)
you want but they changed it from a (85:43 - 85:46)
trainer to a supporter which is what (85:45 - 85:50)
Sabrina is Sabrina you don&#39;t get to pick (85:46 - 85:52)
but that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying so I know (85:50 - 85:54)
it&#39;s digital only so it&#39;s like instead (85:52 - 85:56)
of like like waiting down the line and (85:54 - 85:59)
introducing a new card and then phasing (85:56 - 86:01)
out like the old stuff they can just (85:59 - 86:02)
change the cards on the Fly because (86:01 - 86:04)
there&#39;s not they not physically printing (86:02 - 86:07)
these cards for people to play with but (86:04 - 86:09)
I still feel like they would do it in a (86:07 - 86:10)
way (86:09 - 86:13)
where oh yeah I guess I don&#39;t know it (86:10 - 86:14)
would take too long to like pH it out (86:13 - 86:17)
over time the change to Sabrina is or (86:14 - 86:18)
sorry not the change to Sabrina I think (86:17 - 86:21)
the change to Misti is flip two coins if (86:18 - 86:23)
heads attached to water (86:21 - 86:25)
energy I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s (86:23 - 86:27)
still incredibly good I don&#39;t think (86:25 - 86:30)
anyone takes it out of their deck like (86:27 - 86:33)
almost every single water Pokemon are (86:30 - 86:34)
probably sitting at three so even with (86:33 - 86:37)
the Articuno situation you don&#39;t need (86:34 - 86:39)
you don&#39;t need 17 water energy on (86:37 - 86:42)
Articuno you don&#39;t even need six water (86:39 - 86:44)
energy on Articuno like you you just (86:42 - 86:46)
need three the only reason you would (86:44 - 86:48)
ever attach another water energy to (86:46 - 86:51)
Articuno is to (86:48 - 86:53)
retreat because it&#39;s it&#39;s a true Retreat (86:51 - 86:58)
cost but but like the only water Pok√©mon (86:53 - 87:00)
I think that takes advantage of extra (86:58 - 87:02)
water energy and I could be wrong is (87:00 - 87:04)
like Blastoise which is three water (87:02 - 87:06)
energ it&#39;s one water energy two (87:04 - 87:09)
colorless for 60 and then it will do (87:06 - 87:10)
extra damage if there&#39;s two extra water (87:09 - 87:12)
energy on it which is (87:10 - 87:15)
five it just like Lapras does that as (87:12 - 87:17)
well regular Lapras oh Lapras does that (87:15 - 87:20)
as well as hydropump (87:17 - 87:20)
yeah but like getting two energy on a (87:21 - 87:27)
turn plus playing your energy is already (87:24 - 87:30)
so incredibly powerful like even with (87:27 - 87:32)
meww and people think meww is like the (87:30 - 87:34)
best deck in the game I don&#39;t think it (87:32 - 87:37)
is it&#39;s it&#39;s a good deck but like even (87:34 - 87:40)
with Mewtwo you can only have two gardav (87:37 - 87:42)
Wares because it&#39;s two two two two roals (87:40 - 87:44)
two CUO two gavor and so that&#39;s two (87:42 - 87:47)
energy each turn I can attach plus my (87:44 - 87:51)
third energy and I have to get all of (87:47 - 87:54)
those cards out I have to get guard of (87:51 - 87:57)
War to a stage three and the fact that (87:54 - 87:59)
Misty can be played on turn one and (87:57 - 88:02)
again it is a coin flip I understand but (87:59 - 88:06)
like like oh cool Articuno has five (88:02 - 88:08)
energy on it it&#39;s turn one they&#39;re (88:06 - 88:10)
attacking me for 80 and I haven&#39;t even (88:08 - 88:12)
started the (88:10 - 88:13)
match (88:12 - 88:16)
like it&#39;s just not (88:13 - 88:19)
fun and I think the problem with Misty (88:16 - 88:20)
is like what happens (88:19 - 88:24)
when a Kyogre comes like you don&#39;t have (88:20 - 88:27)
to like Kyogre ex or Lugia EX or just a (88:24 - 88:30)
regular Lugia like the more water (88:27 - 88:31)
Pokemon they (88:30 - 88:36)
add the more the more just like options (88:31 - 88:39)
a misty deck has well and it&#39;s weird (88:36 - 88:43)
because like Blaine and Brock (88:39 - 88:45)
and uh what&#39;s it Lieutenant Serge (88:43 - 88:49)
they&#39;re all Pokemon focused trainers (88:45 - 88:52)
yeah Brock is like Onyx and graler and (88:49 - 88:54)
Blaine is like Ninetails and Rapid Dash (88:52 - 88:57)
Lieutenant Serge&#39;s Magneton and Raichu (88:54 - 88:59)
and Misty is like any water Pokemon you (88:57 - 89:02)
want what you want a Psyduck with 30 (88:59 - 89:04)
water energies we can make that happen (89:02 - 89:07)
does s up need 30 water energies nope (89:04 - 89:11)
but it can happen on turn (89:07 - 89:11)
one like I guess they could change Misty (89:11 - 89:18)
to like only Blastoise and (89:14 - 89:21)
Lapras like I I&#39;m very confused why (89:18 - 89:25)
Misty exists unless they knew that like (89:21 - 89:28)
let&#39;s make one card that&#39;s kind of (89:25 - 89:31)
doesn&#39;t follow the rules of every other (89:28 - 89:34)
card right well I don&#39;t know they had to (89:31 - 89:36)
have thought about that as they were (89:34 - 89:37)
putting this all together I mean it is (89:36 - 89:39)
weird that it stands out so differently (89:37 - 89:41)
from the rest of the the gym leader (89:39 - 89:45)
cards right and it&#39;s the only gym leader (89:41 - 89:48)
that doesn&#39;t have specific Pokemon in (89:45 - 89:50)
its rulesets like Kaa is (89:48 - 89:53)
coughing Erica&#39;s heal any grass Pokemon (89:50 - 89:55)
for 50 oh you&#39;re right you&#39;re right he (89:53 - 89:57)
that&#39;s not attack right that&#39;s not an (89:55 - 89:59)
attack uh thing what wait what is (89:57 - 90:01)
Sabrina oh well Sabrina is a totally (89:59 - 90:04)
different yeah Sabrina&#39;s just boss&#39;s (90:01 - 90:05)
orders I don&#39;t know why they just didn&#39;t (90:04 - 90:07)
yeah like it&#39;s very confusing that (90:05 - 90:09)
Giovani is in the game because Giovani (90:07 - 90:12)
is normally boss&#39;s orders but Giovani in (90:09 - 90:15)
this game is Just plus power uhhuh like (90:12 - 90:18)
you couldn&#39;t just make a plus power card (90:15 - 90:22)
yeah that is that is weird um so I guess (90:18 - 90:23)
this does bring up the the thought of (90:22 - 90:25)
like (90:23 - 90:28)
are they going to phase cards (90:25 - 90:32)
out in this game at some or like how (90:28 - 90:33)
fast are they going to face and and then (90:32 - 90:35)
how fast would they do that right (90:33 - 90:37)
because this game we have to remember (90:35 - 90:41)
this game is not battle focused from the (90:37 - 90:44)
side of DNA and the Pokemon company this (90:41 - 90:45)
is I know somebody who just got their (90:44 - 90:49)
Apex emblem f45 battles I (90:45 - 90:52)
disagree this as well as how they&#39;re (90:49 - 90:54)
marketing this game is not it&#39;s about (90:52 - 90:57)
the collecting and not about the and (90:54 - 90:59)
battling seems at least the way that (90:57 - 91:01)
they have put this out there it doesn&#39;t (90:59 - 91:02)
it just seems like it&#39;s not the main (91:01 - 91:07)
focus for them right now and so it does (91:02 - 91:08)
lead to questions like I could (91:07 - 91:10)
understand them coming out with a new (91:08 - 91:13)
set somewhat often because it&#39;s about (91:10 - 91:14)
collecting they want people to collect (91:13 - 91:18)
the cards but then it leads to are they (91:14 - 91:20)
going to phase sets out are they not (91:18 - 91:22)
going to and then they do what you said (91:20 - 91:25)
and they start changing the actual cards (91:22 - 91:28)
cuz they can do that on the Fly uh (91:25 - 91:30)
there&#39;s a lot of like things we don&#39;t (91:28 - 91:32)
know in how they would try to fix (91:30 - 91:34)
something like that or if they really do (91:32 - 91:37)
believe they need to fix it they might (91:34 - 91:40)
say like hey we did this on purpose and (91:37 - 91:41)
again like I know people don&#39;t like (91:40 - 91:45)
playing the Misty deck but it is there&#39;s (91:41 - 91:46)
so many things that actually have if you (91:45 - 91:47)
actually think about how much has to (91:46 - 91:50)
happen for that Misty deck to work on (91:47 - 91:53)
that first turn it&#39;s quite a lot as (91:50 - 91:55)
someone who plays a marrow ex deck and (91:53 - 91:57)
everything I&#39;m basing my hopes on are (91:55 - 91:59)
two coin flips that are going to you (91:57 - 92:01)
know go heads so I can knock out an (91:59 - 92:05)
immersive Mewtwo or a Mewtwo X um (92:01 - 92:06)
there&#39;s a lot that has to go right for (92:05 - 92:09)
that Misty deck to do anything yeah I (92:06 - 92:10)
think that the the difference though (92:09 - 92:14)
between your deck any Marowak deck or (92:10 - 92:16)
any exeggutor deck or and I will I will (92:14 - 92:19)
tell people if you are not very good at (92:16 - 92:22)
battling or you&#39;re new to battling or (92:19 - 92:24)
you don&#39;t have a lot of good cards I (92:22 - 92:29)
think the like Diglett Doug Trio Marowak (92:24 - 92:32)
Cubone deck is really good because uh (92:29 - 92:34)
even if you&#39;re not super good you can (92:32 - 92:37)
win that game by like 50% I can&#39;t be (92:34 - 92:40)
attacked or or I can hit two heads and (92:37 - 92:43)
do 160 damage with Marowak right like (92:40 - 92:46)
you you are you are openly choosing a a (92:43 - 92:48)
deck on chance and exeggutor is the same (92:46 - 92:49)
it&#39;s like I think it&#39;s like guaranteed (92:48 - 92:51)
40 damage but if you flip the heads you (92:49 - 92:54)
could do 80 damage for one energy so I (92:51 - 92:56)
think (92:54 - 92:56)
I I I think they&#39;re easier decks to (92:57 - 93:02)
Pilot and they&#39;re more RNG focused and (92:59 - 93:03)
and that&#39;s totally okay like obviously (93:02 - 93:05)
in like the video game you could you (93:03 - 93:09)
could run fissure and hope that you win (93:05 - 93:12)
and that&#39;s fine right (93:09 - 93:14)
um my problem my my problem with Misty (93:12 - 93:18)
is it just breaks rule one of the (93:14 - 93:21)
game of assuming that it works but like (93:18 - 93:23)
I still have a problem with it breaking (93:21 - 93:27)
rule one of the game and once you get (93:23 - 93:29)
like if you if you got two heads and you (93:27 - 93:31)
attached you&#39;re at three and now you&#39;re (93:29 - 93:35)
doing 80 damage consistently with no (93:31 - 93:38)
drawback and it&#39;s impossible to catch up (93:35 - 93:39)
whereas like if I&#39;m playing against (93:38 - 93:42)
Marowak and Bobby set up perfectly I can (93:39 - 93:44)
still go like well if he flips two tails (93:42 - 93:46)
I have a chance and then Bobby flips two (93:44 - 93:48)
tails and I&#39;m like I have a chance like (93:46 - 93:50)
he flipped two tails like I&#39;m still in (93:48 - 93:53)
it where like with Articuno there&#39;s (93:50 - 93:55)
there&#39;s no penalty once you get and (93:53 - 93:56)
that&#39;s why you see so many concede on (93:55 - 93:59)
turn one it&#39;s like oh like (93:56 - 94:02)
like like they don&#39;t want to act like (93:59 - 94:05)
they so many articunos can still win the (94:02 - 94:07)
match after turn one if they fail taals (94:05 - 94:08)
but they don&#39;t want to they don&#39;t want (94:07 - 94:11)
to play the game uh it it&#39;s like it&#39;s (94:08 - 94:14)
like a mindset of like I don&#39;t actually (94:11 - 94:17)
want to do this I just want to flip and (94:14 - 94:19)
then there&#39;s like the mindset of like oh (94:17 - 94:22)
I flipped so now I I ultimately I (94:19 - 94:24)
ultimately win whereas at Le at least (94:22 - 94:27)
with Marowak you got to play the game to (94:24 - 94:29)
get to Marowak you just don&#39;t start with (94:27 - 94:33)
Marowak no I understand but still like (94:29 - 94:35)
there&#39;s still a lot that has to happen (94:33 - 94:36)
that like I get it you&#39;re playing you&#39;re (94:35 - 94:38)
just playing flipping a coin and hoping (94:36 - 94:41)
that like you just get that perfect role (94:38 - 94:44)
of basically heads four times over the (94:41 - 94:45)
course of like your first turn right (94:44 - 94:48)
like going first and then three heads to (94:45 - 94:49)
get the three energy attached to your (94:48 - 94:52)
Articuno on top of Misty being in the (94:49 - 94:54)
first like five cards you pull or (94:52 - 95:00)
whatever um but I guess like I just (94:54 - 95:03)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if like would adding (95:00 - 95:05)
losses to people&#39;s because right now (95:03 - 95:07)
there&#39;s no losses on your record yeah I (95:05 - 95:09)
was just about to say this seems like a (95:07 - 95:11)
place where a ladder comes in handy (95:09 - 95:14)
potentially yeah but not even not even a (95:11 - 95:16)
ladder as much as I feel like if I go (95:14 - 95:18)
look at my battle record and it&#39;s only (95:16 - 95:22)
showing me my wins then it&#39;s like okay (95:18 - 95:23)
cool like I&#39;m seeing how many times I&#39;ve (95:22 - 95:25)
won not thinking about how many times (95:23 - 95:27)
I&#39;ve played but I am seeing how many (95:25 - 95:30)
times I&#39;ve won where once you start to (95:27 - 95:32)
see a battle record where you&#39;re seeing (95:30 - 95:35)
your wins and your losses does that make (95:32 - 95:37)
people go away from a deck like MTI that (95:35 - 95:41)
is so so much chance and yeah they&#39;re (95:37 - 95:42)
quick if you just concede matches right (95:41 - 95:44)
away they&#39;re quick because you can just (95:42 - 95:45)
jump into the next one and try to flip (95:44 - 95:47)
again but if you start to see your (95:45 - 95:49)
losses rack up because you&#39;re playing a (95:47 - 95:50)
deck like that where you probably lose a (95:49 - 95:53)
lot more than you win then does it maybe (95:50 - 95:56)
stop stop people from doing that to see (95:53 - 95:59)
those losses good (95:56 - 96:01)
point I don&#39;t know cuz unless unless you (95:59 - 96:03)
are keeping track (96:01 - 96:07)
yourself like I I got I got to 45 (96:03 - 96:09)
relatively quickly the for the Apex (96:07 - 96:14)
thing um and most of that was streamed (96:09 - 96:15)
so I could I could go back in my stream (96:14 - 96:16)
and I could actually count how many (96:15 - 96:19)
times I lost I don&#39;t remember (96:16 - 96:22)
but like there were there were a handful (96:19 - 96:25)
of games where it was like oh I lost (96:22 - 96:28)
because I didn&#39;t draw or (96:25 - 96:31)
like again I don&#39;t know what like the (96:28 - 96:32)
longevity of these battles are and (96:31 - 96:35)
obviously we have a very limited set (96:32 - 96:37)
it&#39;s brand new there&#39;s not a lot of (96:35 - 96:39)
decks (96:37 - 96:42)
but you can kind of figure out if you&#39;re (96:39 - 96:46)
going to win or lose after like turn (96:42 - 96:48)
one espe like it like if they if they (96:46 - 96:50)
had a really good opening hand and (96:48 - 96:52)
you&#39;re like I don&#39;t have a Professor Oak (96:50 - 96:54)
I don&#39;t have a Pokeball I got a lonely (96:52 - 96:57)
voltar out here yeah like I need a (96:54 - 97:01)
miracle to happen to come back from this (96:57 - 97:03)
and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just because (97:01 - 97:06)
there&#39;s not enough cards in the game or (97:03 - 97:08)
you know if I wanted to add a different (97:06 - 97:10)
electric Pokemon to (97:08 - 97:13)
Pikachu I&#39;m pretty limited like I got I (97:10 - 97:16)
got Electabuzz I got Pinchin I got Helo (97:13 - 97:17)
tile like and I don&#39;t know why you would (97:16 - 97:19)
run heop tile over like electrode (97:17 - 97:22)
electrod just kind of better um so (97:19 - 97:24)
you&#39;re maybe you don&#39;t have an electr (97:22 - 97:26)
Steve maybe you didn&#39;t pull V voltor yet (97:24 - 97:28)
so you got to put Helioptile in your (97:26 - 97:30)
Pikachu deck and it does kind of work (97:28 - 97:33)
okay that&#39;s (97:30 - 97:35)
true I I I I don&#39;t know I I could (97:33 - 97:38)
definitely see them changing (97:35 - 97:42)
Misty and if they don&#39;t change (97:38 - 97:44)
Misty I think I think you have an (97:42 - 97:46)
excellent point of if they started (97:44 - 97:47)
showing losses maybe people would be (97:46 - 97:50)
like ah I don&#39;t want my losses like cuz (97:47 - 97:51)
it&#39;s so you&#39;re right it&#39;s so easy just (97:50 - 97:53)
to like concede get back in and that&#39;s (97:51 - 97:54)
probably (97:53 - 97:57)
faster than playing out a match for most (97:54 - 97:59)
people oh yeah right especially people (97:57 - 98:02)
that are trying to just do the 45 for (97:59 - 98:04)
the for the emblems right like yeah (98:02 - 98:05)
people like you said people want to get (98:04 - 98:08)
there as quick as possible well throw up (98:05 - 98:10)
a misy deck and you&#39;re just conceding (98:08 - 98:12)
every you know minute or you&#39;re winning (98:10 - 98:14)
very quickly and you can kind of get to (98:12 - 98:16)
your 45 quicker even though you might be (98:14 - 98:20)
playing 180 games and you lost you know (98:16 - 98:21)
you know a hundred of them or something (98:20 - 98:25)
like that to get your 45 uh (98:21 - 98:26)
you know you&#39;re not seeing your losses (98:25 - 98:28)
so (98:26 - 98:31)
yeah yeah I think even (98:28 - 98:34)
even I&#39;m sure by the time this comes up (98:31 - 98:35)
there will probably be more decks (98:34 - 98:38)
popping up but because New Zealand had (98:35 - 98:43)
30 days we learned that Pikachu EX and (98:38 - 98:45)
meww ex were the two best decks in the (98:43 - 98:48)
format and really during that 30 days no (98:45 - 98:50)
one talked about Articuno it wasn&#39;t (98:48 - 98:52)
until and I&#39;m sure somebody was playing (98:50 - 98:54)
it it wasn&#39;t until like grassroot (98:52 - 98:56)
tournaments popping up where Articuno (98:54 - 99:00)
won one of those tournaments of like 40 (98:56 - 99:01)
people and people were like what a deck (99:00 - 99:03)
with two Articuno and 18 trainers like (99:01 - 99:06)
that&#39;s crazy and also very easy to build (99:03 - 99:10)
um and then it felt (99:06 - 99:14)
like okay Pikachu Mewtwo (99:10 - 99:17)
Articuno and then like Marowak was like (99:14 - 99:19)
very like B tier of like just coin flips (99:17 - 99:23)
and stuff which is like fine um and then (99:19 - 99:26)
all of a sudden this like last week it (99:23 - 99:27)
was like well primeape came out of (99:26 - 99:30)
nowhere just because of a single mkey (99:27 - 99:33)
card and like literally the day before (99:30 - 99:35)
we started recording that people were (99:33 - 99:37)
like oh I think wigglytuff&#39;s going to be (99:35 - 99:39)
big and Wiggly and I think we said last (99:37 - 99:40)
week (99:39 - 99:42)
Wigglytuff is or jiggly there&#39;s going to (99:40 - 99:44)
be a better Jigglypuff card coming (99:42 - 99:49)
eventually so it is cool that like (99:44 - 99:52)
literally one Mankey card made like (99:49 - 99:55)
fighting decks more viable and ideally a (99:52 - 99:56)
Jigglypuff is going to make Wiggly tough (99:55 - 100:01)
more viable I think that&#39;s super cool um (99:56 - 100:04)
and I&#39;ve also seen that like I think I (100:01 - 100:07)
think it&#39;s like they&#39;re calling it Agro (100:04 - 100:10)
fire where it&#39;s just like Ninetails and (100:07 - 100:12)
Rapid Dash with Blaine yeah which I (100:10 - 100:14)
actually lost like when I was I need (100:12 - 100:16)
like I need like seven more wins last (100:14 - 100:19)
night and my only loss was against (100:16 - 100:23)
Ninetails uh uh Ninetails rapid Dash cuz (100:19 - 100:25)
like I didn&#39;t know what it did I was (100:23 - 100:27)
like oh somebody&#39;s playing Blaine I was (100:25 - 100:28)
like I don&#39;t know what Blaine does it (100:27 - 100:31)
destroys you that&#39;s what it does oh it (100:28 - 100:33)
adds like a bunch of more like it&#39;s like (100:31 - 100:36)
a better Giovani plus power um and I was (100:33 - 100:38)
like dang that&#39;s really cool and then I (100:36 - 100:41)
like I I I went on like blue sky and (100:38 - 100:43)
somebody was talking about like how like (100:41 - 100:46)
egro uh Ninetales was like how they got (100:43 - 100:48)
their 45 wins and I was like I just saw (100:46 - 100:50)
one for the first time like I&#39;m sure (100:48 - 100:52)
we&#39;re going to be seeing more so it is (100:50 - 100:54)
really cool it&#39;s it&#39;s was like you give (100:52 - 100:57)
more people the game and more people (100:54 - 101:01)
discover more ways to win like sorry New (100:57 - 101:03)
Zealand where was your Ninetales where (101:01 - 101:05)
was (101:03 - 101:05)
your where was your Articuno yeah yeah (101:06 - 101:13)
new Ze didn&#39;t think of that yeah I guess (101:09 - 101:14)
that I&#39;m thinking back because I was (101:13 - 101:16)
thinking like well they could just add a (101:14 - 101:18)
trainer or something but to your point (101:16 - 101:20)
like you&#39;re not using anything when that (101:18 - 101:22)
person hits three water energy and (101:20 - 101:24)
attacks you right like you never had a (101:22 - 101:26)
chance to do anything so like unless the (101:24 - 101:28)
trainer is like if you have this in your (101:26 - 101:30)
hand it negates misti&#39;s entire thing (101:28 - 101:34)
you&#39;ve activated my trap card (101:30 - 101:37)
Misty then uh then yeah there is really (101:34 - 101:39)
nothing they can do there and I don&#39;t (101:37 - 101:41)
know I still don&#39;t I still think it (101:39 - 101:45)
would be weird to see them change an (101:41 - 101:47)
like an active card like to your point (101:45 - 101:49)
with the with the Pokemon catcher thing (101:47 - 101:51)
that&#39;s a little bit different in that (101:49 - 101:53)
like they it it waited until the next (101:51 - 101:55)
like until X and Y came up they came out (101:53 - 101:57)
with the new card they had to phase out (101:55 - 101:58)
the old stuff right it was when things (101:57 - 102:01)
got phased out so it wasn&#39;t like they (101:58 - 102:02)
didn&#39;t change a card on the Fly where (102:01 - 102:04)
they&#39;re like this actually does this now (102:02 - 102:07)
even though it says that you know and (102:04 - 102:08)
obviously they can do that in a game (102:07 - 102:09)
like this because they can just change (102:08 - 102:11)
the text on the digital version of the (102:09 - 102:15)
card um and I I guess they could do that (102:11 - 102:17)
I just it feels weird but I guess I&#39;m (102:15 - 102:21)
just thinking about it from a (102:17 - 102:25)
TCG in real life like aspect where that (102:21 - 102:27)
just doesn&#39;t obviously make sense for (102:25 - 102:30)
them to do in on the fly so like you (102:27 - 102:32)
know next week all of a sudden Misty has (102:30 - 102:36)
a you know two you can only do this two (102:32 - 102:37)
times instead of three or some whatever (102:36 - 102:42)
you know like feels very weird to me but (102:37 - 102:45)
might I think hot take if Misty was just (102:42 - 102:48)
play card attach one water energy to any (102:45 - 102:50)
Pokemon no coin flip it I would it would (102:48 - 102:53)
be a better card I would take that (102:50 - 102:55)
consist (102:53 - 102:55)
any day of the week yeah you&#39;re all (102:55 - 102:59)
about the consistency though not the (102:57 - 103:02)
coin flips even though Mr play zaptos (102:59 - 103:05)
with a four coin flip but like I think (103:02 - 103:07)
those Articuno decks would be better if (103:05 - 103:10)
it was just like consistent ad one water (103:07 - 103:13)
energy mm it&#39; make people play the game (103:10 - 103:16)
way better than a coin flip yeah I mean (103:13 - 103:18)
you&#39;d have to play the match right you&#39;d (103:16 - 103:20)
actually have to like play out the (103:18 - 103:24)
entire match (103:20 - 103:24)
yeah I don&#39;t know I think I get more (103:24 - 103:28)
enjoyment when I watch them concede (103:26 - 103:31)
after they fail a coin flip than I do (103:28 - 103:34)
just winning yes (103:31 - 103:39)
true thumb conceeding feels (103:34 - 103:39)
great (103:39 - 103:45)
um okay well I think we&#39;ll have to save (103:41 - 103:48)
more TCG stuff for next week there&#39;s so (103:45 - 103:50)
much to talk about for pocket that we (103:48 - 103:54)
haven&#39;t even like got to so um we&#39;ll (103:50 - 103:57)
wrap up there uh if it sounds like next (103:54 - 104:01)
