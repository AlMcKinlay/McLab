[Music] what's up everyone welcome to in the four hundred and fourth episode 404 of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ with me today is Will and if you looked out your window this morning and said who's that idiot riding their bike in this bridging snowstorm that was me I really like riding my bike Greg though also Here I am here and sometimes snows in April it's snowing yeah we have a Pokemon show for you guys today lots of sorting shoot stuff this week it's not like you can really go outside and play pokemon go is that a game still yeah yeah there was a event today too that we could talk about there what I was playing I was playing Pokemon go this morning there was like an event but let's start with me I turn remember hearing that there was event look I forget that that gaming let's start with the sword and shield news here kiddo Pichu mime jr. munchlax riolu man Tyco and more appear in max raid battles this is off Pokemon calm trainers in Pokemon sword and Pokemon shield might be surprised to see a little Pokemon dramatically increasing and might see surprised to see little Pokemon dramatically increase inside in the wild areas max ray battles from now until April 15th until 5:00 p.m. PDT you are more likely to encounter the Dynomax versions of ditto Pikachu cleffa oh sorry that's at Pichu cleffa togepi hi rogue why not Badou Bond sly mime jr. munchlax riolu man Tyco and toxsa Lyn max raid battles additionally defeating one of these Pokemon into Max ray battles could get you useful items like destiny not and and or ever stone as of this recording it'll be around for another two or three days a couple things from this event kind of short but the dittos are all guaranteed 5 Ivy's rulebook gotta get some of them five-star ditto is normally guaranteed for Ivy's five-star raids were guaranteed for Forrester Reds are guaranteed three three-star roads guaranteed - so these are all guaranteed 5 there promoted so they should appear in a variety of dens around the area there is still Charizard kappa raja garbodor etc that are appearing as well the did that all the baby Pokemon so not did OH are appearing exclusively in three or four star trades is there a strategy for making sure that you get the dude oh no just probably repeat bullet it's probably your buzzing ball how do you make sure that she is there any trick to making sure you kill it Oh ditto can't transform into a she ins a magenta or a turn attest so if you just bring those it literally cannot transform so it just struggles or just does max strike I think okay that's what strategy yeah I don't know if I could turn into melt in I'm assuming it can can definitely turn into Solrock I saw Martin bring that and yep turn into Solrock Martin but then that soil rock doesn't know when he moves so you have to worry about cosmic power them I wanted I can turn into me you I know that for sure cuz I've brought me from the pokeball plus it definitely can turn into Mew I think it's just yeah I think it's just zombies ntozake and eternities because those cannot those Pokemon cannot Dynomax so a ditto can turn into zombies enta but a Dynomax did oh cannot turn into zombies enta I see what you're saying it's it's a cool event they continue to do events I think we might have said that the kapa Rajah garbodor Charizard was too long because it does end at the end of April and it started the end of March but if this little event makes it feel less long I guess this is something to do I mean people are still playing Animal Crossing left and right so it's kind of hard to pull people away from Animal Crossing true especially Animal Crossing stacked two events on top of each other Oh well yes that's very frustrating and put me off the game but um I'm excited for this i I think Monday night raid nights gonna be a lot yeah well I'm excited Monday night raid night the I've done a couple of the babies they're really easy you could probably have fun and bring in a variety of Pokemon for the babies they're uh very straight up flexin yeah they're they're very easy to knock out but they're cute they're fun they also will drop power bands so if you're missing any of the power items Bo power anklets the power bracelets the power necklaces the power wristlets they're dropping all those and Everstone Destiny's not and they are also 10% chance I think to drop a lucky egg as well so even if you don't need any of these Destiny's not ever stone power items lucky egg drops are really good obviously you're getting rare candy as well too if you have all your Pokemon with multiple lucky eggs to they stack I don't know like there's the Sheridan stat yeah like the they get even more experience assume so and I think so I don't know where it splits his every game it's kind of done it I think they did it a certain way and like the Gentoo and then they change in Gen 3 and then I feel like they changed it ago they're always changing stuff up to keep me on my toes that's what my toes are tired I don't know yeah I'm not a hard percent sure on that I don't want to give false information I make an infographic nobody reads those the only people that know I was gonna say the only people that read them are the people arguing but their if they read it they would have a reason argue yeah you're wrong that's not how it works this is all soft Pokemon calm they showed off Rudes new exclusive move that it learns at level 90 once reaching level 90 Zurich an learn jungle healing a unique move that only the root can learn don't worry the root I'm sure they'll take it away from you in the future game oh absolutely in this grass type status move the Pokemon wraps its vines around trees to absorb their energy then releases that energy combined with its own healing power radiates around the area heals both the user and the aisle ally restoring HP and curing them of any status condition it does so help us or something that looks so angry it does say no note within Pokemon sword and shield only the root can learn jungle healing however it is possible that other Pokemon may be able to learn this move in future games get rekt so rude get rekt cuz kruky is gonna get it the next game they take away turbo blaze and teraflop from that ramen restaurant yeah but those were those were just they were always what was it the other one that makes things that shouldn't hit hit mold breaker well they were too small breaker yeah I'm talking about no they they have what what wait what is know as the fusion players what is there actually I did mention that was their bodies what is their actual move is it not using bolts fusion flare oh that's right they're their speciality I don't think anybody ever not but he needed Vic team to get it I thought Victini might have gotten fusion flare bolts I don't know what they're called yeah bolt strike is this the one that we're talking about bald strike that sounds right Victini did get bolt strike from Zekrom hmm the Pokemon Center Tohoku Victini had bolt strike and rushy Ram blue flare ah blue-eyes White Dragon and the Pokemon Center Tohoku Victini also had blue flare why wouldn't it why way yeah why not two is better than one else has gotten blue flare okay blue flare even do its mix things on fire the booth reflects damage and has a 20% chance of burning the target that's nothing a lot of things have a 20-person chance burdening the target hey no one said these were great yeah exactly I think my favorite thing I saw on the Internet I love reading the Internet guys a big fan of that dark place big fan of reading the Internet I saw a comment it said oh here we go the comments said we don't even need this pokemon and they're not wrong they're not wrong I mean we're good to start talking about what poke about we do or don't need we're not gonna play this game anymore yeah I mean I I needed to like take a step back and try to like see where they were coming from cuz you're right there's a lot of Pokemon we probably don't need I don't think anyone needs silcoon I don't think anyone needs Pidgey look there's whole lines of Pokemon right nobody needs madam but they were they were saying it based off the the hill the jungle healing that move right that's why you know it ended up on the the news or in and like I'm subreddits and Twitter and stuff the jungle healing so if they were talking about it from a competitive aspect there's a lot of Pokemon that don't even qualify in the the needing to be competitive I mean a lot of hope I should be competitive but they're not but also wreck if for some reason they thought they were like being like oh we don't need this Pokemon because they're not gonna help the competitive scene they wouldn't help the competitive scene anyways its mythical there's no 2021 the year of the mythical when this is dominating the competitive scene you're gonna mark today down and we'll see how this holds up any yes you're like the the 1% of Pokemon fans that place Mogan and I'm sorry like there's such a small percentage of people that play competitive Pokemon and there's an even smaller percent of people that want to set up their own arbitrary rules to you know remove all the rng like this it's just another Pokemon I mean they'll like I don't think anyone's been like we need a stone journey as really turning the tides here like what this just a Pokemon okay we don't need the rude well that's just like tears you see that in like every form of competition where people are like it's all about the competitive and it's like 98% of the world is like it's not about the competitive at all friends but that 2% right oh it's it's everything should be about the competitive yes and as as we've learned from reddit 1 Japan doesn't have the Internet we've we've no narrowed that down but number two is reddit is probably the last place you want to go for competitive information this was like do you keep making me go to reddit there now you know you couldn't stop with reddit is the last place you want to go exactly everybody would have been in agreement to be fair I saw that comment on our / Nintendo now it's time to unsubscribe from our / Nintendo but our / Pokemon was the same community that was like oh my goodness g max dread nog gets a G max rockfall and it sets up stealth rock well this is just broken the entire competitive scene is over now because of this one I don't think a single competitive person is even touched at Remax red now maybe if you were playing maybe if you actually played competitive reddit and said I'm wasting your time commenting on things you didn't know about you'd understand that no one uses tell the rock people on reddit to stop commenting a things that they know nothing about then reddit will cease to exist also I didn't know there was such a thing as competitive reddit and I hear another comment about how the store and Animal Crossing upgrades after 30 days you're a chapter 13 I don't know where you read it from but multiple people have the store and they did not time travel I don't know what triggers the store stop coming into my twitch chat and telling me that the store only upgrades after 30 days because you're ready on reddit no it doesn't it upgrades somehow some way 30 days top Dirk is holding out on me game hasn't even been out for 30 days so how would you know 30 days 30 bugs 30 fish 30 fossils you have to spend Mike exactly 3030 in Nuuk shop no more no less so if you think you're over you have to sell everything to eat you back down to zero and then buy to 30 30 because 30 is clearly the key I could never do an animal crossing podcast because the amount of misinformation around animal crossing new horizon animal animal crossing line is available everywhere where you can find podcasts you don't talk about rumors or speculations on that show it's just a purely informative joyful show we're only positivity happens okay but the the amount of misinformation around Animal Crossing is actually mind-blowing well if they put out that guidebook we wouldn't have this issue now would we that's true anyway is there no prima guide for the game because that was my next thing there is delay a guidebook but they have to ship it through boats and the the boating community is a bit behind because of the virus okay I put the books on the boats well it's not ready I'm also pretty sure that prima is not the publisher I can't remember the publisher future press future press yes yeah they put out a blog post saying that Australia and us will get the book like a month late jungle healings a rude gets it when it hits level 90 uh that's that's it that's the news the route is still a Pokemon oh so this is even worse because the majority of people aren't going to level up there's a rude to level 90 they're gonna hide me get it from the distribution in a box and never touch it again I will because I have so many candies it takes two seconds max that out and be like fine get to 100 just be done with us next we are going to needs a rude for future max raid battles where we can jungle heal the entire party to defeat oh yeah when it comes back this is off dexter TOCOM Pokemon company threatens Pokemon sword and shield cheaters I'm gonna say that that headlines a little click Beatty oh is it I don't especially with the picture of a very very angry aliena trainers have been exploiting a bug in Pokemon sword and shield to prevent them from getting a legitimate loss in ranked battles now though the Pokemon company it seems to had enough they're threatening to ban players that do it I'm sure the word threat was never used this exploit is not a threat it's a promise the exploit occurs at the end of the battle when you lost without dulling too much into specifics in an effort not to amplify the problem you can turn off your Nintendo switch at certain points to prevent the loss this may prevent the loss for players in question but more worrying it actually stops the player from getting the wind this means the exploit will affect if effectively mean that the battle never happened the issue has become so prevalent that the Pokemon company did address it in a matter did address it directly this really isn't typical of other exploits addressed in the same manner there this is off the Pokemon - support comm / news / article which is Pokemon - support comm is the Japanese support page which is kind of weird because it's usually it's like Pokemon debt JP anyways it's how it is the translated I'm assuming the R I'm just gonna assume the author used Google Translate but maybe they have a Japanese person and site that can translate fluently but this is what it's been translated to it says it has been confirmed that players in trainer battles and online competitions have deliberately interrupted their internet communications resulting in improper manipulation of their matches they then said if it is confirmed that such illegal operation and annoying acts have been performed repeatedly the cheater will be excluded from participating in ranked battles and internet competitions and the right to participate in live competitions this has not been addressed in the at the in the US at all hmm but that was published on April 8th so just four days ago as of this recording cheaters never win the easy thing would be like why don't they patch it I'm sure they're working on a patch hi it may not be patchable it's just don't just be like because you're manipulating the way that the but the game data is saved it's like no matter where they put the timing of how that save occurs that's like the probably the only thing that they can do is patch it in a way that they'll be able to more easily detect who's doing this and maybe like Auto banned them but not in a way that can stop it from happening and I think they have to be pretty careful in I mean they clearly will see it on the back end I'm assuming of like this was not a completed match this was not a completed match because if you if you okay so I've done a lot of ranked battles if you rage quit and I've had people rage quit against me the battle will like immediately end it will say like Oh battle is over it'll say like communication error or whatever actually I think it's this communication error first but you but I have always gotten the win I still get the win from the rage quit so that's not what they're saying you can still if if if you still want to you know turn off your console or throw it across the room in a rage of fury that you lost so my stealth rock debt dread nah I should still be able to get the win I am sure though that there's been situations where you know internet just cuts out or something happened where the match just doesn't count I don't think for the majority of people that this is ever going to affect them I don't think anyone has to worry about like oh I don't know if I want to do right because my Internet's being wonky and if it cuts out I don't want to get banned I am sure they're specifically going after people that are doing this multiple times in an evening or like they own have wins and disconnects I feel like that is like the easiest way to tell like oh you've never lost you only have wins and you only have no gate no contest no contest no game come like but you're right hey I didn't think about that maybe there's no way to patch it but this is a relatively new issue I mean we do a podcast every week we didn't talk about this last week if they were to do a patch it'd be relatively quickly for them to like find it address it push an update midseason so I at the end of the day I don't think this is a huge deal I think the author of dextro is really going hard on the the clickbait of the article but yeah and there's probably I mean it's probably more apparent because more people are doing online play versus going to a Pokemon League and playing in person yeah so that's why this becomes more noticeable I'm not sure so many people at home figuring it out and then once they figured it out spread it out I think it probably just hit critical mass with so many people not being able to do anything but play games at home I wonder how much the competitive is taking a hit though of people just not interested in competing until the 2020 season is over okay any points even if you were practicing with Pokemon now you know comes September when the new season starts there will already be one expansion out with new Pokemon so it's like why even bother yeah but somebody for the joy of competing that's true that's you don't want the practice some people want to learn all of the current strats because if somebody tries to fake everybody out by going back to something else like there's a lot of knowledge and practice still to be gained even if you aren't in the current you know season like yeah so much of what that game is as being able to predict correctly and know what the most common moves are and that just is repetition over and over and over and over again when you're watching one of these competitive people on Twitch they they seem to always win because they're like playing at eight hours a day every single day and I'm playing competitive maybe like two hours a week and I'm playing once every time there's a ball guys shirt and is a luxury ball guy I can't wait for that day to come all right let's let's take a break here and when we come back we have a little bit more pokemon news some TCG news some other stuff here so we will be right back dun dun dance dance I've done a dance dance I've done a dance dance abundance dance dance dance abundance [Music] [Applause] [Music] dance abundance [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Gregg and will would you like to watch free movies no thanks well I what are they well yeah movies for free that I've really regretted that life choice Wow you have to have one of these streaming services but it's not free I guess I know neither of you to cancel that your HBO subscription when you were done with Game of Thrones is this what I have to put my legal requirement that I work for a company that owns HBO so I get it at a high discount so no I didn't cancel it oh where I put my legal requirement that I never had a subscription to HBO and I don't care about Game of Thrones well if you happen to keep your HBO after Game of Thrones they just added Pokemon detective Pikachu to the service yeah they yeah we did that was through my work internally doing the good fight it's not that's that's pretty much it that's pretty much the story if you have HBO and HBO did if you have a lot of our streaming services check into your HBO availability they did either heavily discounted or include it for free for a lot of people so you may have it and not know that you have it wait there's there's more than one HBO service isn't there there are like seven oh like HBO Go and HBO now or there's HBO GO HBO now HBO Macs and there's a couple of others but if you have DirecTV DirecTV go or ATT TV or ATT TV go you may have HBO for free right now you don't have any of those things I barely have a television set I'm just saying but I just say what I know all right so one time you'll ever hear me talk about my job I believe they've also added some older Pokemon movies to Pokemon TV which is completely free let's talk about some TCG here yeah I don't know anything about a sword and shield rebel clash Greg if I talk about rebel clash last week look they got it they got a cell booster pack so why are these rebels clashing what are they clashing against I think it's supposed to be like a music clash remember when we said that like the starters' rebels in school yeah yeah listen life wait like London Calling yeah yeah like the will in tele and stay or will she go oh I'm shocked and amazed but I applaud you sir why is this a show becoming some musical program because you let me be honest mistakes are made Marilla boom sinner a sin tell Ian and dragged appalled Vmax arrived in the Pokemon TCG sword and shield rebel clash players got their first taste of the mighty Pokemon V and V Max in the latest TCG sword and shield expansion rebel clash brings even more of these incredible cards to the table with final evolutions of the first three starter Pokemon in Galler it will be available on may 1st they will feature a hundred and ninety cards that sounds like a lot I think cosmic eclipse is still the biggest one cuz making oh yeah there's there's been bigger cosmic eclipse has had 236 cards plus 35 secret rares so this is uh about 40 cards less not too bad uh we're not gonna go through the specific cards for real abou mass inner race and intelli in you can look him up you don't want to talk about real abou max beating his D max max beating is his move not only does it this vicious attack hit for 130 damage you can choose up to three grass energies to disk from marilla boom v max when you use it adding 50 damage for each card you discard that does up to 280 damage from a single max beating talk about lowering the boom yeah [Laughter] Wow and we're just gonna acknowledge that Italian to be Max's max bullet max bullets all right what do we got here the max bullet attack hits your opponent's active pokémon for 161 of their bench Pokemon first 60 Hydra sniped also does 60 damage but lets you send an energy attached to your opponent's active pokémon back to their hand and it seems fine yeah sure although the full art Antillean it's really good-looking well arts always look good I know but this is really good so this that's coming out I this is the first time boy since this is the first time since black and white the last box I think I bought was plasma freeze I did not buy a single box of anything X&Y or Sun and Moon although I did buy I started buying elite trainer boxes when Sun and Moon came out so I completely mixed missed everything X&Y probably for the best full-backs of cosmic eclipse your favorite no I bought two elite trainer boxes of cosmic eclipse which is kind of dumb cuz you're paying extra for like sleeves and dice and the box itself you're paying a little bit extra for that I probably should you most people only need one buy Holy Trinity but I have pre-ordered a booster box of rebel clash and I did get a pre I did get a booster box of sword and shield because they've been really fun to open up on stream I'm excited I'm excited to receive a fresh brand-new set of Pokemon TCG the cards of the cards in this these last couple sets I've at least look really good from past cards do they have wait first off statement I like LGBT Pikachu that's real cute I want to get one of those yay you have trainer cards for the two weirdos if they appeared in the case a sword burden horror sherbert shield burg a steel burg and sword Burton no they have not appeared in the TCG yet I can't wait they're pretty great I have the best hair and I'm really hoping we get access to the Royal hair line in the first expansion pass because if we do not get access to the Royal hair line I'm gonna riot quit now frauds you don't know what the cup weather public wants and needs was their characters they didn't make cards of they made Fah I'm pretty sure there was a faba there was a wick wiki Harvey say her name Lucy mean there's been looker cards right there was a looker card yep I don't know if there was an Annabelle car I'm trying to think there was D ant diantha was a card cynthia of course a car it is always a card iris holla I think there was even a Vulcan error card at one point I wouldn't I wouldn't see why there wouldn't be sword bird and shield bird I would imagine they would where were those three dancing girls in Omega Ruby alpha sapphire they all got cards they were the contest ladies watch well you have what I have no idea what he's talking about watch they do they like dance I don't even know I don't even know what they're called dance ladies pokemon TCG I mean there's the kimono girls from joto but what dancing girls in Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire was that not the set they were from there definitely were not from Sun Sun and Moon are you sure you're thinking about Pokemon yeah gosh I have Dana is one of them so this Dana Dana CNC oh I went to high school with her Dana Nita and uh uh what are the other ones I think this was sudden when Dana Nita Pokemon TCG here's Dana full art is he much it was from team up team up was the set which is sudden moon so it was a Morgan Dana elleven and Nita were the four are these based on somebody from the game they're all they're all based on like like all all the all the pokemon stuff is based off people from from the now they have TCG cards that are like not based on video game people all right here we go battle Chatel line Morgan as her full name she is one of their floor leaders from the battle mansion and x and y OU and omega ruby alpha sapphire alongside Nita elleven and Dana ot we're from dance anime song I thought they were from I thought they were from the the contest in Omega Ruby alpha sapphire no I don't remember seeing them in next mile yeah they had the house up on the top of the hill yeah so Morgan is the leader of rotation battle format in the battle mansion mace on sorry as well as the eldest of the battle chateau lien sisters Morgan can be battled once the player acquires a 19 win streak she can be Babel later upon the super rotation battle once you have a 49 win streak and they said that X&Y had no post game y'all just didn't get a 19 win streak more when I spend a lot of time in the battle chateau trying to get that or battled maze on trying to get my special berries Morgan may also appear sila LOL evelyn in a multi battle after you you do a 19 win streak what pokemon does she use a hoe boy she's a bunch of winners here man teen sawsbuck swalot and cleft oh and then if you were to get her in the super rotation battle she's bringing the big boys she's bringing the big dawgs called Bali and Taraki and Virizion and latias yeah Morgan knows what to do yeah so in the TCG if you could play all four of them they'd like do something you need like all four in your hand and then if you had all four in your hand you could you could do something really weird it was very very gimmicky Evelyn had raikou and suicune and Latios way dude there is they all just have like Legendary's what's happening yeah well neat Nita had thunderous Landorus and tornadoes dana has Articuno Zapdos Moltres regirock red regice and reggie steel red GG ice and yep yeah you're right Nita has the forces of nature you guys three cuz Nita is a force of nature thank you very much boy I can't believe we got to the point of the show where we're talking about four characters that's probably game only characters that appear gonna say this their hats are amazing and they're think their dresses are amazing I think I need to make them an animal crossing somehow they're really great they're full art cards Greg are incredible ooh I just want these nice yeah but like oh here's all four of them their hair is impossible and that is why I love them the most you can you can get the whole set Greg Pokemon Japanese cards LF Evelyn Dana Morgan Nita secret rare full arts mint all four Japanese versions on eBay I got the postage right here they're saying free postage two for the price of $69 well no $69.99 yeah well they take on the Burger King gold and trade hey they even say in the post they'll wrap it in cardboard before they ship it that's quality right there nice oh man they won't even use a top loader well you got a sleeve top loader then cardboard then true then you're good to go that's gonna cost extra though oh this Pinterest picture of them is outstanding I swear if anybody's ever on any kind of TCG Facebook group at least once a week there's a discussion of who is the scoundrel who's shipping cards without using a top loader I mean they should be put in prison you have you don't be--that's can hundred whole you know cheap and top loaders are like five cents each they're so they're so you can get a hundred top loaders for like $6.99 on Amazon they're dirt cheap I don't understand who's shipping cards in that without top loaders especially if you're shipping one card it's like sleeve it top loaded put a stamp on it throw in an envelope you're fine it'll make you don't even have to go to Facebook this week I just saved you don't have to find that thread of the scoundrel who did you that oppler for you right here like I'm bringing up reddit complaints and wills over here bringing face I refuse to get sucked into reddit no matter how many times you try to trick me read it Florida backyard look at these tragic toilet placements reddit look at this shower with an orange in it ready look red it's awful but I'm think I think if I have to pick a side I'm picking reddit over Facebook not on the card fight Vanguard community oh that's why you got to start your own reddit community for Vanguard and then you can nurture and grow it stop trying to get me to use reddit you're not gonna make reddit a thing this is off Pokemon go live.com for one pokey coin in the shop you can get 20 ultra balls and 15 pin apps you can access that until Monday April 13th 3 p.m. central time so if you have not redeemed that please do they will rotate it out with something else semantics because of the world that situation has been taking out different boxes on Mondays for one coin so last week it was 50 great balls the week before it was 100 all pokeballs I do feel a little ripped off that it wasn't 25 ultra balls but I guess they countered it out with 15 pin at Barry's so if you are still playing Pokemon go make sure you redeem that I'm playing right now was there supposed to be an event today there was an event today there was a mayoral battle League day who what I know what Meryl is so during 11:00 to 2:00 your time you could do go battle league and you could so they change you know how it was like you have to do three matches and then if you win the fourth match you get a Pokemon and then after five matches the caches and resets and you can do that unlimited or you could do the paid version where you get a Pokemon at two wins and step four wins well they updated it for the three hours where you get one win you get a Pokemon and that Pokemon was guaranteed to be Merrill and there was a like i'll i think the self rode as of this recording said it was about a one-inch chance of a shiny merrill and then you would get another pokemon that three wins and then I think another f4 and then it would reset so that happened I did I got two Merrill's neither were shiny it's fine you could pay the dollar to get like all Merrill's I think all five were Merrill's for your wins i I don't know if they saw it as a success I think that Pokemon go battling is still kind of bad I think great league is is the the great league is fun enough for me to be interested in doing it like once a day because I think the entry to I think the Pokemon choice is in great league are more interesting and I think it's easier to be more willing to try things at such a low Stardust and candy cost but this was Master rank stuff so the only things you were probably fighting against were like Guerra Tina and Dialga and anyone who is serious is probably having one of those to be their walking buddy so they can max out the CP and have the little ribbon on it I just don't cash I just don't know why cuz they just wrote it rotated to master ranked like a couple days ago like why master rank I don't know what they were trying to do or prove but like number one if you're not they already know the majority of the playerbase is not level forty I know like I know look there's hardcore people that have been level forty since like the second week of the game the majority of Pokemon players are not the majority of Pokemon go players are not level forty if you're not level forty you can't max out your Pokemon you have to be at least level 38 to max out your Pokemon maxing out a Pokemon such as Giratina or Dialga would one require you to do a lot of raids to even have a good garrett ena or a good dialga and then two would just destroy you in stardust number three if you did do a lot of raids and you spent a lot of money you probably still don't have enough candy to do it so then you're using rare candy to Max them out then on top of that they want you to like walk with one of them to like boost their CP even more their likes just so many barriers so like I hate Master rank for all those reasons but why would you apply every single one of those barriers to something that like hey everyone we have this cool event that not all of you can do and even if you did want to compete with your your CP 3000 Kyogre well guess what it's not good enough because all these players have 4000 CP K yogurts because they spent way more money than you it's like very clear it's not like I got lucky I got a really good you know Tropius traded from me from my friend Hannah and I can use it in master like and I got really lucky and it competes with all these other Pokemon it's did you spend enough money and play our game enough to be level 42 verse other level 40 players in an event on a weekend that is supposed to be quote unquote for everyone it like why was this not great league or why when I could not go into it I don't get to like do I want to play great league do I wanna play ultra League do want why is it specifically is such a bad premise uh it's called masterly for a reason supposed to be a master yeah its elite for elite people like how can you put out a press release that says celebrate the launch of go battle league leaderboards with Meryl day like brand-new event featuring the Merrill have fun a pot they say in their press release a popular Pokemon for a great link why are we doing this advance early gun antic why it's all bad it's awful oh gosh you'll be able to compete 20 sets of go league battles from the regular sets of five you can do a hundred battles a hundred awful battles against Naga no one wants to do this and people complain about me yeah like what was the thought process like event should be fun okay it is Pokemon go we're talking about fun is how you make it and you could say like just skip the event this is what we've always say just skip the event but I like genuinely genuinely want to give go badly good chance and even if I was like okay I you know what I've hated Master League before you're gonna hate it now I I'm gonna really give it need the old the old try right you know just suck it up you know invest my Stardust invest my rare candy do it even if I wanted to and I did this with VGC like right I said on this podcast for years that like you know what I'm not really into competitive and when sword and shield came out I was like you know what I'm gonna suck it up I'm gonna rent some teams I'm gonna keep losing and people saw me lose and get frustrated on stream because I inherently I am a competitive person but over time I got better at it and I saw improvements and now I feel like I have a pretty good grasp at like amateur level competition but even if I wanted to compete to do like 5050 right win one match lose one match whatever you know or even you know win one match lose three matches whatever the amount of barriers you have to jump through are impossible I can't just go out and get a garrote inna I just can't go out and get a Dialga so like I can't I can't imagine a player who's like sitting at home being like you know what I really want to compete the alga and Giratina are good I have 300 rare candy that I've been saving I'm gonna sit here and I have this really bad Dialga that I guess like it's my only one I guess I'm just going to invest all the Stardust and all this rawr candy and oh I'm still losing because I didn't get a good enough four stars and when dialga comes back around oh cool I caught a four star but I just wasted all the 300 rare candy and I'm out of Stardust like what that's such a bad experience in any kind of game this is not specific to Pokemon go but just that like thought process of like and again I wouldn't probably have this complaint if this was great League because greatly the barrier to great league is so low and they literally in this press release say that this Pokemon is amazing in great league well awesome well like some like what what do you want your player but if you want your player base to be happy why did you do this event the only people being happy are the people are that are like yup been walking this Diago for 18 weeks oh yeah it's 4,000 I don't know why they sound so like probably still driving to raids every single day during a pandemic the car we're gonna drive around 15 miles an hour and not get arrested so I can get my candies so I can win the Master League I have met tons of people that love great league I've met a bunch of people that have a pretty good time in ultra League I find I have found no one and I talked to I talked to two hundred-plus Pokemon fans a day I talked to no one that has been happy with Master League I don't even know at what point is it is it is it it's everything it's everything about Master League it's the Pokemon it's the Stardust cost it's the rare candy cost like everything about Master League is bad and this is like this was like the Sunday event they decided to throw its the problem that all sort of high-level limited option games have right like there's no good way around when you have when it's must be you know these are the best and you design widely varying Pokemon and some are just never going to be adequate when you get a small pool and those pools are all legendary Pokemon it's just even in VZ C's is a frustrating experience but the cost is less this is like that's not true cuz the cost to be good at VGC is time well yeah any competitive is time I had some what I did I did so I play pokemon go on stream every tuesday cuz normally tuesday they do the six o'clock events and so I popped the incense I sit it's great to chat with other people they're doing the same thing we're all sitting at home with an incense on catching pitchy Xandra tattoes because the incense isn't popping anything good we're all having it like a good time just sitting talking catching pokémon and like last Tuesday I wrapped up you know the event was over it was the poor loins and stuff and I was like you know what um somebody was like what team are using for great league because I'm I'm almost positive as greatly no it was all true league at the time cuz I was like oh I have a toga kiss for Ultra League okay well um what chat why don't you help me like let's let's get this pokemon off the team you know I have hey I have hair crossed I got pincer-like I got whatever you want if you and I got all this for a candy you guys pick a Pokemon you think is good all invested were candy I'll invest the Stardust this will be fun and I was you know saying these complaints that I've said in the podcast about Master League and somebody was like well it's the same thing in the book about a video game in sin Aurora is just everywhere and it's like yes in ultra ly Giratina and Reggie Steele and all these other Pokemon are everywhere the difference is I can get and I can get a little with intimidate pretty easily in the video game I can't get a Reggie Steele right now I can't get a Giratina right now like that is the actual problem is like if these are the dominant Pokemon I I can't get them and even if I could get them I don't know if they're air quotes here I don't know if they're you know go battle league ready yeah because you don't check them immediately after you catch them so annoying going back to all of that if this is the if you're announcing a new feature of a leaderboard you're giving an event for it three-hour special time merrill increase the shiny rates get people to play don't you also think at like the core system that you want to I don't know maybe have the format that people at least have vocally expressed that they liked the most which is great League and not the format where most maybe I'm in a bubble but most like everyone around me no one has told me they loved Master League I love Master Li do not fraud burst your bubble I just think like first impressions go a pretty long way and this is my first impression of lera there whatever new system rolled out go battle League leaderboard it will show the top 500 trainers around the world with their trainer nickname team rank and total matches that's all the Pokemon news I got that's it what is this week's spotlight our April spotlight ours what is this the 14th Magnemite Magnemite Oh Craigs least favorite yeah come we don't have any Pokemon masters news this week how could that be full disclosure I'm partnered with DNA Lamont and heliolisk is coming to masters that was posted on their Instagram I think last night yeah it's not Clement is that no he said no I just thought you were gonna say Clamato tomato and Helio lick bunny drink pretty sure it's come on there's a new gotcha game for card fight Vanguard which has doubly reinforced for me my lack of interest in playing any kind of gotcha game at all is it do you like it more or less than Pokemon masters equally at the bottom of the barrel what's it called cart visit Vanguard guard zero and what are you getting like what are you pulling for cards so you can do deck building it's just it's not for me it's the all the lights and the noises and the people screaming at me in Japanese and it's like we've got the yellow coin for this and the red coin for this and the Gacha ticket for this and the Gacha pass for that and right as you get your own room before why I have an entire apartment all to myself I said this apartment could probably fit five people and yet it's all just for will I don't need virtual room look at all these characters though who I Chi Chi Ren reto Ren with his pinkish purple hair clan shadow paladin mazaki yes run plays the shadow paladin's mazaki shin wait after look nozaki i have been covering this card game for yeah mazaki is in here I'm looking site not a great website but you're like let me see if they're in there I know that they're in there Craig well our listeners don't oh but do they do they really care about Iraqi and her Oracle think tanks Tetsu has dark your regulars Tetsuo question of the week if you could develop your own pokemon game which region would you put it in queries like these Kapost it in slack and become the question of the we [Music] I really messed up my levels for the week I know it was that the question or is that just the slide it's just the song I don't know the question that's your job okay this is from Robert in slack it says what makes the best breeding area and what location has come closest to the Pokemon games by it uh what makes the best breeding area what location has come the close in the Pokemon so when breeding what does your ideal location look like a Long's like so if I can go just in a circle and come back around what was this it was that X&Y that you could do that in the city was there a brain oh no no no oh maybe alpha sapphire had it yeah best they were island that was a square and you can literally just hold down the paddle and ride your bike around that square until the egg that's my idea you can go in a circle and when you complete the circle you're back to see if you have another egg Omega Ruby alpha sapphire had that on the island that is my ideal sword and shield has just a long bridge and they have to turn around that is now what do you do while the area is the best breeding cuz you can move the camera what are you even looking at I'm watching TV while going back and forth I'm not looking at anything and wild area has like cubs you come out and try to murder you while you're trying to hatch an egg can I also have my Pokemon a sword and shield complaint of the week TM will enter we got make this a new scam yeah Anderson's Pokemon sword and shield in a in a segment why are there pokedex Pokemon that are only available in the wild area that are new Pokemon for the region I but I discovered that I almost threw a shoe through my television set three P you can only get three P in the wild area yes correct know you is that that's not true three P is exclusive to wonder trade what are you talking about [Laughter] gadem these Bob drapey is the only way you can get wonder trade Oh Andy he's only available who under trades and love ball so stop looking I don't know that's like a complaint uh I mean I don't think my baby's gonna complain to you it's a complaint to well yeah because once I want to encounter all of at least all of the region's new regions Pokemon as I'm playing the story I don't want to have to go into that area that I don't want to go into at all anyways to fill out my pokedex and only find out that oh hey this Pokemon you're missing is only available in the wild area only under certain weather conditions so you know you'd better wake up at the right time of day and hope that everything the stars align so that ate that 4% chance that it might appear in a patch of grass it'll show up Johto you want laughs you gonna do it on Friday at 6 p.m. on you get paid for this this isn't my job I just have a question our dragons and ghosts easy to find in the real world or do you have to hunt have you seen the Burger King across the street from my house full of people waiting in line to get subpar food and that line for the drive-thru last night I am not kidding you 20 cars oh that's our Culver our Culver had like 17 cars waiting in that parking lot and they are slow Culver is slow because they have to like make the food and then run it out to your car I didn't mind the breeding area in black - white - they made a really really long path you just go zigzag back and forth paksy excellent wise is good for that bleeds nigh cuz you just went to the cave and came back and by that time you had neg still turning around that's an extra button push I don't need to do while I am reading subtitles in the current anime that I'm watching I don't know you give me you give me camera control I'm into that so sword shields my control freak even even when I was like playing you know games like destiny I would just be running around moving like that just the constant movement that's smooth is all I need to preoccupy myself I'm the person to final fantasy 14 that's like running a circle jumping over and over because I just need my character to move in some motion I'm aware or I was you stop playing yeah regrets real good I ain't going anywhere and I'm not filling you in on the story play it read out by the Cliff Notes version of that's it my days of supporting you are over we'll put one of the week I may have failed at this week's Pokemon of the Rica but locate last week Greg don't like it number one it has the ability where if one of another Pokemon faints its special attack goes up kind of weird ability there and its name is an anagram for anagram if you remove one letter what pokemon is it it's I think he guessed chatot last week to which I'm just gonna keep guessing chat loo I already did chat taught a few years ago so that's not coming back yep I think so raise your hand and not McGee Erna the answer is McGee or not correct major knows the only Pokemon that is able to learn moves by TM outside of the ones it learns through yell level up yet is unable to learn toxic or sleep talk what does that mean I don't it says I've Pokemon the other pokémon that can learn moves by TM can learn toxic yes and Wow but that the worst way to say it I don't know if that trivia stands true anymore cuz they remove toxic from so many Pokemon and sword and shield but can they learn it by TM let me decided TM me more yeah it's not TM anymore oh I mean I currently it's coming back in the expansion past the TM they're just doing that to get your money couldn't copy again with TM that yeah McGee knows the only just left it out me girls the only mythical Pokemon to be made available in the core series games through infinite activity event what does that mean that means that you scanned the QR code and Sun and Moon and you can get the MiG you're not given to you ah yeah it's indefinite forever like that code will always work in those games is I think what they're trying to say there I say Jirachi is infinite forever but that's technically a bonus disc my bonus disc I still haven't found my purple game kid until generation 8 McGurn us a shiny color scheme was identical a shiny major and I was on a table unattainable those still unobtainable Pokemon home includes the data for my gear and a shiny palette McGurn is based off a rabbit yeah it's got rabbit ears sure rabbit wearing a skirt and a car curry puppet pup those puppets fYI sort of freak me out and Lily owns spoiler for the end of my Lily owns that Macrina it's in our mansion what you're two years too late how dare you how dare I I think that's it why does she have a mogera if I thought she didn't like Pokemon I didn't see the episode will I just know that there's a mechanic I hate hundred thousand Pokemon people a day
