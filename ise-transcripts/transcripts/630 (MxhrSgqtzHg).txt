uh just my standard FTC disclosures (2:01 - 2:06)
Pokemon company is paying for my flight (2:04 - 2:08)
and my hotel they do require me to do (2:06 - 2:11)
like one YouTube video One live stream (2:08 - 2:14)
and I think like three Twitter posts (2:11 - 2:17)
those will be disclosed uh as they do (2:14 - 2:20)
this is we do talk about Hawaii almost (2:17 - 2:22)
every week that&#39;s not I&#39;m not getting (2:20 - 2:23)
paid to do that we would be covering (2:22 - 2:25)
Hawaii regardless because it&#39;s the world (2:23 - 2:29)
championship but if there was if Pokemon (2:25 - 2:30)
paid for this podcast there would be (2:29 - 2:32)
something here they&#39;re not paying for (2:30 - 2:35)
this podcast so I can say bdsp is bad (2:32 - 2:38)
it&#39;s a terrible game do not buy (2:35 - 2:40)
it all right now that we&#39;ve made it (2:38 - 2:43)
through there uh Pokemon sleep a good (2:40 - 2:47)
game a game it&#39;s still exists and is (2:43 - 2:49)
still doing (2:47 - 2:52)
well if Bobby was here he&#39;d be excited (2:49 - 2:53)
that&#39;s what I&#39;m (2:52 - 2:58)
saying that is that is true uh I did get (2:53 - 2:58)
is it (2:58 - 3:01)
flato is that the (2:58 - 3:03)
yeah I got one just showed up was (3:01 - 3:05)
hanging out so I said why don&#39;t you join (3:03 - 3:09)
the team nice I&#39;ve been playing on my (3:05 - 3:12)
tablet oh yeah you putting that M4 (3:09 - 3:14)
tablet under the (3:12 - 3:17)
pillow next next to your pillow letting (3:14 - 3:20)
it exist so in slack Al sent a picture (3:17 - 3:23)
of Pokemon sleep on a fold open Google (3:20 - 3:26)
Android phone and it looked amazing (3:23 - 3:27)
because you could see the entire (3:26 - 3:29)
campsite just on the screen without (3:27 - 3:32)
having to left or right and I (3:29 - 3:34)
immediately went yes I want that that (3:32 - 3:36)
looks incredible that looks like the (3:34 - 3:38)
ideal play experience and then I put it (3:36 - 3:40)
on my tablet and it is locked into (3:38 - 3:42)
portrait (3:40 - 3:45)
mode so you can&#39;t do that you still have (3:42 - 3:47)
to (3:45 - 3:51)
scroll does it at least uh look good (3:47 - 3:53)
yeah it looks fine it just looks like a (3:51 - 4:00)
big phone oh okay it y best laid plans (3:53 - 4:02)
that&#39;s a bummer that you can&#39;t do you (4:00 - 4:04)
can&#39;t flip it horizontal right because (4:02 - 4:06)
it looks amazing when it&#39;s horizontal (4:04 - 4:07)
you wouldn&#39;t flip it horizont what are (4:06 - 4:09)
you saying you can&#39;t flip you would (4:07 - 4:11)
you&#39;d be like I&#39;m happy that it&#39;s locked (4:09 - 4:12)
in this horrible portrait (4:11 - 4:16)
mode no when I when I use my iPad like (4:12 - 4:19)
twice a year I do use it horizontally (4:16 - 4:21)
because it&#39;s attached to the keyboard uh (4:19 - 4:23)
thing the keyboard attachment I just use (4:21 - 4:26)
it as like a smaller computer that can&#39;t (4:23 - 4:29)
do nearly as much as a computer can and (4:26 - 4:31)
then I mve to to my computer cuz it can (4:29 - 4:33)
do (4:31 - 4:33)
more yeah that&#39;s pretty much it um so so (4:34 - 4:42)
you&#39;re not sleeping with your iPad under (4:40 - 4:45)
your pillow I currently am just because (4:42 - 4:48)
the setup (4:45 - 4:51)
process the process of transferring your (4:48 - 4:53)
account is annoying doesn&#39;t that hurt (4:51 - 4:57)
isn&#39;t that heavy no it&#39;s fine (4:53 - 5:00)
um I (4:57 - 5:04)
it&#39;s fine it I a little (5:00 - 5:08)
complicated it&#39;s it&#39;s more vertical than (5:04 - 5:10)
under the pillow it&#39;s like next to the (5:08 - 5:14)
pillow cropped up yeah but it also means (5:10 - 5:16)
that I can keep using my phone as I&#39;m (5:14 - 5:19)
going to sleep oh that&#39;s a benefit yeah (5:16 - 5:21)
yeah that&#39;s why I have the go Plus+ even (5:19 - 5:23)
though Kaiju stepped on it the other (5:21 - 5:24)
night and turned it off again yeah my (5:23 - 5:27)
Plus+ is under my bed (5:24 - 5:29)
somewhere what is it doing under your (5:27 - 5:33)
bed and it disappears disappears for 3 (5:29 - 5:37)
weeks comes back to like ah I&#39;m using an (5:33 - 5:41)
iPad now go plus plus like this is the (5:37 - 5:45)
wildest absence in a long time what (5:41 - 5:48)
what it fell off the side of the bed and (5:45 - 5:50)
there&#39;s a wall there and it&#39;s annoying (5:48 - 5:53)
and I&#39;m probably moving soon (5:50 - 5:56)
and I&#39;ll just get it (5:53 - 5:58)
then (5:56 - 6:01)
okay well there&#39;s two events that have (5:58 - 6:03)
been announced uh the first event is (6:01 - 6:05)
water week and then the second event is (6:03 - 6:08)
suun is coming so we&#39;ll just run through (6:05 - 6:10)
these events uh I feel like those should (6:08 - 6:11)
be more (6:10 - 6:13)
related uh they they are cuz they want (6:11 - 6:16)
you to get water Pokemon for the suun (6:13 - 6:20)
event which suin will be on green grass (6:16 - 6:22)
um so the water event will take place on (6:20 - 6:25)
Monday August 19th so not this week (6:22 - 6:26)
you&#39;re listening to the podcast this (6:25 - 6:29)
podcast comes out on the 12th uh we&#39;ll (6:26 - 6:31)
go for a week it will appear in all (6:29 - 6:35)
areas minus some Pok√©mon only appear in (6:31 - 6:37)
some areas so they&#39;re introducing (6:35 - 6:40)
Whooper and Quagsire we don&#39;t know (6:37 - 6:43)
anything about what Whooper and Quagsire (6:40 - 6:45)
can do but those are the new (6:43 - 6:47)
Pokemon (6:45 - 6:50)
I don&#39;t know to me they kind of seem (6:47 - 6:52)
like berries like if I was to guess if (6:50 - 6:53)
I&#39;m looking at all the water Pokemon we (6:52 - 6:55)
only have (6:53 - 6:58)
like the Totodile line I think are (6:55 - 7:00)
mostly berries everything else seems (6:58 - 7:02)
very ingredient or (7:00 - 7:04)
skill-based but anyways you have a (7:02 - 7:07)
greater appearance of Squirtle War (7:04 - 7:09)
thortle Blastoise Psyduck Golduck (7:07 - 7:12)
Slowpoke slow bro Vaporeon Totodile (7:09 - 7:15)
crocodile feraligator Whooper Quagsire (7:12 - 7:19)
slow King quackley and (7:15 - 7:19)
quaw because quack waval is technically (7:20 - 7:26)
not water in this game which (7:23 - 7:28)
is weird to think about well not weird (7:26 - 7:30)
but makes sense (7:28 - 7:32)
uh green grass is going to pretty much (7:30 - 7:35)
have everything I just named except for (7:32 - 7:37)
slow (7:35 - 7:40)
King and one other Pokemon in this list (7:37 - 7:42)
uh cion Beach is going to have (7:40 - 7:45)
everything I named topalo if you decide (7:42 - 7:47)
to go there Hannah that&#39;s your favorite (7:45 - 7:51)
you get only Whooper and only Quagsire (7:47 - 7:52)
but those are the new ones right so (7:51 - 7:56)
that&#39;s like M right there yeah so if you (7:52 - 7:58)
do have a good Squirtle and a (7:56 - 8:00)
good (7:58 - 8:03)
toile and maybe a couple other water (8:00 - 8:06)
Pokemon you might want to go to topalo (8:03 - 8:07)
snow drop will just have Psyduck (8:06 - 8:10)
Slowpoke and slow (8:07 - 8:14)
bro maybe if you I get I feel like the (8:10 - 8:15)
only reason you would go there is if you (8:14 - 8:19)
care about Psyduck because except you (8:15 - 8:21)
can get it elsewhere where you can also (8:19 - 8:24)
get Wooper so yeah but I guess you would (8:21 - 8:26)
go there if you found out Whooper was (8:24 - 8:28)
bad and you&#39;re like I don&#39;t want Whooper (8:26 - 8:31)
to take away from my Psyduck (8:28 - 8:33)
maybe um and then lapis will have the (8:31 - 8:37)
Squirtle line Psyduck slow bro Slowpoke (8:33 - 8:41)
qule and quaw (8:37 - 8:44)
well I think I&#39;m going to go to top (8:41 - 8:48)
Hollow because I have a good I know I (8:44 - 8:51)
know I&#39;m so close to getting this (8:48 - 8:55)
Pupitar to Tyranitar and I just want (8:51 - 8:58)
that to happen um also I have a good (8:55 - 9:02)
Blastoise and I have a good for (8:58 - 9:06)
alligator and I have a good slow (9:02 - 9:08)
King (9:06 - 9:12)
so you&#39;re kind of good yeah I&#39;m really (9:08 - 9:15)
good I I don&#39;t believe in the Psyduck (9:12 - 9:18)
meta I mean as in you don&#39;t think it (9:15 - 9:21)
should exist or no I think I think it (9:18 - 9:24)
just takes even me paying $10 a month to (9:21 - 9:27)
this game I I don&#39;t have enough skill (9:24 - 9:30)
seeds to put into it and even if I did I (9:27 - 9:32)
would I don&#39;t I would rather just put it (9:30 - 9:34)
into other Pokemon that I like enjoy (9:32 - 9:37)
using yeah no using a master biscuit on (9:34 - 9:40)
a Golduck for you yeah yeah that that (9:37 - 9:43)
the old days of that has passed I did it (9:40 - 9:45)
once and I don&#39;t have to relive it again (9:43 - 9:47)
we&#39;re saving Master biscuits for denes (9:45 - 9:50)
or crar ants or I&#39;ve been on lapis for (9:47 - 9:52)
the last three weeks I&#39;ve seen like one (9:50 - 9:55)
rals it&#39;s been (9:52 - 9:55)
infuriating uh people like Whooper (9:55 - 10:00)
though (9:58 - 10:03)
I think I think if you if they really (10:00 - 10:04)
wanted to shake it up they would have (10:03 - 10:07)
done both whoopers yeah I was about to (10:04 - 10:10)
say people like Claire much more than (10:07 - 10:13)
Quagsire I think yeah Claire is a hit (10:10 - 10:15)
but Whooper is (10:13 - 10:18)
good Claire would definitely be on (10:15 - 10:22)
topalo oh for sure yes Claire would make (10:18 - 10:26)
topalo the best for sure just always (10:22 - 10:29)
topollo usage through the roof if Claud (10:26 - 10:31)
sire was added (10:29 - 10:34)
uh we don&#39;t have a hard date for suun (10:31 - 10:37)
here but they they usually give a week (10:34 - 10:39)
after water (10:37 - 10:43)
week um so like said of September (10:39 - 10:44)
because it says beginning early (10:43 - 10:49)
September so so it feel early September (10:44 - 10:50)
feels like September (10:49 - 10:54)
2nd since that would be a week break (10:50 - 10:55)
after water week and then early (10:54 - 10:57)
September September 2nd uh you can (10:55 - 11:00)
exchange samples of suun main that you (10:57 - 11:04)
collect for suun incense water type (11:00 - 11:05)
Pok√©mon are recommended they list (11:04 - 11:07)
literally all the Pokemon I talked about (11:05 - 11:09)
we&#39;re also preparing some (11:07 - 11:12)
rewards and functions that will allow (11:09 - 11:14)
everyone even sleep beginners to (11:12 - 11:17)
research sleep suun sleep Styles more (11:14 - 11:19)
easily now if you&#39;re a new listener to (11:17 - 11:21)
this podcast or uh you (11:19 - 11:24)
just have still been on the fence about (11:21 - 11:27)
Pokemon sleep uh if you remember or (11:24 - 11:29)
don&#39;t remember I&#39;ll remind you Bobby (11:27 - 11:30)
started (11:29 - 11:34)
Pokemon sleep during the riko event and (11:30 - 11:39)
was able to get two Rios relatively (11:34 - 11:42)
easily yeah I think so these events are (11:39 - 11:45)
made for that to be relatively easy if (11:42 - 11:48)
you&#39;re not aiming to get everything and (11:45 - 11:49)
honestly even if you are aiming to get (11:48 - 11:52)
everything you kind of can get all of (11:49 - 11:54)
the rewards you want regardless of how (11:52 - 11:58)
much you&#39;ve played MH for the most part (11:54 - 12:00)
other than the missions the weekly (11:58 - 12:02)
missions are kind of the ones that (12:00 - 12:04)
you&#39;re going to be held (12:02 - 12:07)
back by experience a little bit (12:04 - 12:11)
yeah yeah I think Bobby even got the (12:07 - 12:14)
main skill seed yeah so got enough for (12:11 - 12:17)
everything um if you do really like suun (12:14 - 12:19)
if suun is the Pokemon that&#39;s going to (12:17 - 12:21)
convince you to download this game or (12:19 - 12:23)
Whooper Whooper is popular I get (12:21 - 12:27)
it uh I made a whole sleep video about (12:23 - 12:30)
that the the best thing you could do is (12:27 - 12:33)
is is join the Discord or the patreon or (12:30 - 12:38)
just any community group and add as many (12:33 - 12:40)
people as possible that is literally the (12:38 - 12:43)
best thing you can do is to get 50 (12:40 - 12:47)
friends the liter all you have to do all (12:43 - 12:48)
you have to do is open the app and then (12:47 - 12:49)
click the little friends button and then (12:48 - 12:51)
you get a bunch of free candy it&#39;s not (12:49 - 12:53)
like Pokemon go you don&#39;t have to like (12:51 - 12:56)
send postcards you don&#39;t have to uh (12:53 - 12:59)
dedicate 20 minutes of your life opening (12:56 - 13:01)
and sending gifts it&#39;s it&#39;s just one (12:59 - 13:02)
button you press usually in the morning (13:01 - 13:04)
and one you press before bed and then (13:02 - 13:07)
it&#39;s like here&#39;s all your friends and (13:04 - 13:10)
you could see what they did uh but you (13:07 - 13:12)
don&#39;t need to to cash in on the free (13:10 - 13:15)
candy every single day I usually check (13:12 - 13:17)
the friends list two times once in the (13:15 - 13:19)
morning once in the evening because some (13:17 - 13:21)
of y&#39;all have wild sleep schedules and (13:19 - 13:22)
also some of you all are in very (13:21 - 13:24)
different time zones yeah the time zone (13:22 - 13:26)
thing really the time zone thing but uh (13:24 - 13:28)
a couple people on this podcast have (13:26 - 13:32)
very straight sleep schedules uh and (13:28 - 13:35)
when I&#39;m up checking in at 8 y&#39;all are (13:32 - 13:38)
asleep and I&#39;m not seeing you registered (13:35 - 13:40)
so I have to check again at night and (13:38 - 13:42)
then you&#39;ll show (13:40 - 13:47)
up yeah I think I have like 6 or seven (13:42 - 13:51)
that they they they check in at like 10 (13:47 - 13:53)
p.m. at night but that&#39;s CU they&#39;re like (13:51 - 13:55)
waking up in like Australia yeah (13:53 - 13:57)
different continents I want to say it&#39;s (13:55 - 13:59)
like I can reliably get 34 and morning (13:57 - 14:06)
and 14 at night I know the shift of (13:59 - 14:09)
people yeah a big buff to this game (14:06 - 14:12)
would be to increase the friend size (14:09 - 14:14)
limit if they were to ever do that yeah (14:12 - 14:17)
that would that would be getting friends (14:14 - 14:21)
is such a big plus and so easy to add (14:17 - 14:23)
the benefit from that that I feel like (14:21 - 14:26)
increasing the friends list maybe risks (14:23 - 14:28)
them lowering the benefits of having (14:26 - 14:31)
friends but (14:28 - 14:33)
potentially I they did say in their (14:31 - 14:36)
oneyear anniversary post that they (14:33 - 14:39)
wanted to like adjust experience and (14:36 - 14:42)
adjust onboarding new players I think (14:39 - 14:44)
there will be this has to be like this (14:42 - 14:47)
Pokemon go thing of re-evaluating (14:44 - 14:49)
experience I mean the game&#39;s been out (14:47 - 14:51)
for a year (14:49 - 14:54)
and it&#39;s so hard to get a single Pokemon (14:51 - 15:00)
to level 50 without yeah spending money (14:54 - 15:03)
so there has to be a point (15:00 - 15:05)
where they have to change something I (15:03 - 15:07)
mean Pokemon go did they they made it (15:05 - 15:10)
where you got way more experience with (15:07 - 15:12)
excellent throws and they obviously when (15:10 - 15:13)
they added the friends list you got a (15:12 - 15:15)
bunch of experience just by having (15:13 - 15:17)
friends with (15:15 - 15:19)
people (15:17 - 15:23)
um side note little bit of Master&#39;s news (15:19 - 15:26)
that I just thought of they like redid (15:23 - 15:28)
the storyline stuff in Masters so if you (15:26 - 15:30)
just log in you&#39;ll just get a bunch of (15:28 - 15:33)
gems cuz they decided that people (15:30 - 15:35)
starting the (15:33 - 15:37)
game weren&#39;t getting enough gems from (15:35 - 15:39)
doing the (15:37 - 15:41)
story yeah I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any (15:39 - 15:44)
more news to that Greg besides that um (15:41 - 15:45)
so it depends if you&#39;ve been playing (15:44 - 15:47)
from the beginning and you done the (15:45 - 15:49)
entire storyline uh when I logged in and (15:47 - 15:52)
they adjusted it I got 15,000 (15:49 - 15:55)
gems there&#39;s a lot W it&#39;s a lot I mean (15:52 - 15:58)
it&#39;s 5 11 PS right in front of the (15:55 - 16:02)
anniversary so if go and check it um I (15:58 - 16:04)
think the biggest issue was that they (16:02 - 16:07)
were running (16:04 - 16:07)
into there was no reason to do the story (16:08 - 16:14)
at this point in the game unless you (16:12 - 16:16)
like stories and I mean so the main (16:14 - 16:20)
story rewarded you but it cost (16:16 - 16:23)
stamina and the rewards for doing the (16:20 - 16:25)
banners and the stories that aren&#39;t the (16:23 - 16:29)
main story were so much better that that (16:25 - 16:31)
this far into the game there was Zero (16:29 - 16:35)
reason to do that storyline um it ate up (16:31 - 16:37)
a lot of your experience your stamina it (16:35 - 16:39)
didn&#39;t give you enough gems it didn&#39;t (16:37 - 16:42)
give you enough experience it just it it (16:39 - 16:44)
felt like oh okay well this is just a (16:42 - 16:46)
thing that I have to check and it&#39;s (16:44 - 16:49)
going to eat up my stamina for the day I (16:46 - 16:53)
will just skip it so I get why they (16:49 - 16:55)
adjusted it because it did need to be (16:53 - 16:56)
adjusted so people would do the main (16:55 - 16:59)
story line uh and feel like they were (16:56 - 17:02)
being as rewarded as you were doing (16:59 - 17:04)
neona showed up for five days let&#39;s go (17:02 - 17:07)
talk to her and you get showered in gems (17:04 - 17:11)
um and tickets and rewards like a ton of (17:07 - 17:13)
things you got for the for the banner (17:11 - 17:15)
stories that you just never got for the (17:13 - 17:18)
main storyline um and I think they (17:15 - 17:20)
realized the only people that completed (17:18 - 17:22)
it is when that was the only thing we (17:20 - 17:23)
could (17:22 - 17:26)
do well I logged in and I only got like (17:23 - 17:29)
9,000 but it&#39;s cuz I never finished (17:26 - 17:32)
the story so I didn&#39;t have all the gems (17:29 - 17:35)
to like recalculate yeah so now if you (17:32 - 17:37)
didn&#39;t finish it you&#39;ll get the (17:35 - 17:38)
heightened reward in (17:37 - 17:41)
essence if you completed the story line (17:38 - 17:43)
you get 15,000 that&#39;s roughly what (17:41 - 17:44)
you&#39;ll get now I think if you complete (17:43 - 17:46)
the whole storyline depending on where (17:44 - 17:50)
you left off um yeah they&#39;re doing a (17:46 - 17:52)
bunch of big changes like that but yeah (17:50 - 17:54)
that was a nice surprise to get right (17:52 - 17:57)
before the second year which we still (17:54 - 17:58)
don&#39;t know what the banner is we still (17:57 - 18:00)
don&#39;t know who we&#39;re getting for the (17:58 - 18:01)
second year anniversary we&#39;re getting a (18:00 - 18:03)
lot of really weird stuff right now and (18:01 - 18:04)
none of it&#39;s second (18:03 - 18:07)
anniversary or third anniversary or (18:04 - 18:08)
fifth I don&#39;t know what anniversary (18:07 - 18:11)
definitely not second nah something it&#39;s (18:08 - 18:14)
higher I I don&#39;t know I think it&#39;s (18:11 - 18:19)
Fifth Fifth yeah because 2019 (18:14 - 18:22)
worlds yes (18:19 - 18:26)
yeah yes fifth yes it&#39;s a fiveyear I (18:22 - 18:30)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in hearing (18:26 - 18:31)
multiple times over the last two weeks (18:30 - 18:33)
that there was going to be a Pokemon (18:31 - 18:35)
Direct on August 8th I don&#39;t know why (18:33 - 18:37)
that day was picked besides there was (18:35 - 18:40)
maybe a Pokemon Direct in 2023 on August (18:37 - 18:41)
8th I think (18:40 - 18:43)
that or the thing that always happens (18:41 - 18:47)
where somebody like will retweet an old (18:43 - 18:48)
like Nintendo Direct or a Pokemon (18:47 - 18:50)
presents and then people don&#39;t look at (18:48 - 18:51)
the dates and they think that&#39;s like the (18:50 - 18:54)
announcement yeah anyways that never (18:51 - 18:58)
happened uh the whoever whatever leakers (18:54 - 19:03)
or or whatever rumor spreaders that&#39;s (18:58 - 19:05)
that&#39;s my new insult you rumor spreader (19:03 - 19:07)
you (19:05 - 19:10)
um there there was no Pokemon presents (19:07 - 19:14)
this week uh may look we can say this (19:10 - 19:16)
every single week until right maybe (19:14 - 19:18)
there&#39;ll be one this week after this (19:16 - 19:22)
podcast is up yeah yeah uh unsure that (19:18 - 19:24)
there was one (19:22 - 19:29)
year where uh it was 2 days before (19:24 - 19:30)
worlds I actually think that was the (19:29 - 19:34)
London one uh otherwise the other two (19:30 - 19:38)
years it was like a week before (19:34 - 19:41)
worlds there was all there look there&#39;s (19:38 - 19:43)
everyone&#39;s been like there&#39;s a Pokemon (19:41 - 19:46)
presents every August no there&#39;s not you (19:43 - 19:48)
can look this up there&#39;s there in the (19:46 - 19:51)
history of Pokemon presents of 27 some (19:48 - 19:54)
years there&#39;s only been three (19:51 - 19:57)
a only three there&#39;s been a couple in (19:54 - 19:59)
June there&#39;s been one in April one in (19:57 - 20:01)
May a lot of obviously the Pokemon day (19:59 - 20:04)
one&#39;s in (20:01 - 20:04)
February as much as I would like a (20:05 - 20:10)
Pokemon presents I love them I think (20:08 - 20:12)
they&#39;re fun they&#39;re exciting to watch (20:10 - 20:14)
with people it gets Pokemon fans excited (20:12 - 20:17)
again usually most pokemon fans are very (20:14 - 20:19)
positive coming out of a Pokemon (20:17 - 20:22)
presents I (20:19 - 20:24)
am I feel like they would have announced (20:22 - 20:27)
it or would have done it at this point (20:24 - 20:29)
and I know people want za (20:27 - 20:32)
news I do (20:29 - 20:35)
too I I find it hard to believe they&#39;re (20:32 - 20:39)
going to show Za news at the end of (20:35 - 20:43)
Worlds that would possibly overshadow (20:39 - 20:44)
those (20:43 - 20:47)
winners when they could have done it (20:44 - 20:49)
before worlds which is when you think (20:47 - 20:51)
about it why they would do a present (20:49 - 20:54)
they would do a present before worlds to (20:51 - 20:56)
one get people excited for worlds but (20:54 - 20:59)
two so you don&#39;t over (20:56 - 21:02)
Shadow you&#39;re giant (20:59 - 21:05)
tournament uh (21:02 - 21:07)
otherwise they would just do everything (21:05 - 21:09)
at Worlds but I I do think there&#39;s like (21:07 - 21:10)
this balance of (21:09 - 21:13)
like obviously announcing that the new (21:10 - 21:16)
venue is is something and the things (21:13 - 21:18)
they do show at Worlds are normally (21:16 - 21:20)
pretty competitive or pretty irrelevant (21:18 - 21:22)
like they showed a caler one time they (21:20 - 21:26)
showed Mega slow bro one time (21:22 - 21:29)
uh uh you could say like the starters (21:26 - 21:33)
coming back was was pretty big and I I (21:29 - 21:35)
do agree that is pretty big but also (21:33 - 21:37)
that game was coming that DLC was coming (21:35 - 21:40)
out in like two months but I would also (21:37 - 21:42)
say that was pretty competitive because (21:40 - 21:45)
the number one competitive Pokemon is a (21:42 - 21:49)
starter incora is coming back is pretty (21:45 - 21:52)
relevant to the competitive scene a they (21:49 - 21:54)
show (21:52 - 21:59)
cyar yes they showed cycl laar at the (21:54 - 22:01)
London worlds yeah I don&#39;t think that&#39;s (21:59 - 22:02)
very (22:01 - 22:06)
competitive uh its move was the that&#39;s (22:02 - 22:11)
true that&#39;s true signature move was yeah (22:06 - 22:14)
um I think in singles it got some play (22:11 - 22:15)
but what was the other there was two (22:14 - 22:17)
Pokemon that got shed skin and one was (22:15 - 22:20)
more useful than psycho laar I don&#39;t (22:17 - 22:22)
remember the the other (22:20 - 22:25)
one I say signature move and I&#39;m like ah (22:22 - 22:28)
but another Pokemon has it yeah I think (22:25 - 22:29)
Pokemon shed (22:28 - 22:32)
skin I think they also (22:29 - 22:34)
showed a couple items I think like (22:32 - 22:38)
loaded dice was shown at a worlds and I (22:34 - 22:41)
think abil uh cover cloak and then I (22:38 - 22:44)
think um like ability Shield were all (22:41 - 22:48)
shown yep at some point at Worlds so (22:44 - 22:51)
that I I I expect there will be some (22:48 - 22:53)
announcement right like I don&#39;t think (22:51 - 22:55)
anyone doesn&#39;t think that I think there (22:53 - 22:58)
will probably be a a small teaser (22:55 - 23:00)
preview in the opening ceremony because (22:58 - 23:02)
that has consistently happened at Worlds (23:00 - 23:05)
um even at one point I think they said (23:02 - 23:07)
at two different worlds they were like (23:05 - 23:08)
we have more news but you got to wait (23:07 - 23:11)
till the end uh and then the other thing (23:08 - 23:12)
is we definitely know they&#39;ll announce (23:11 - 23:15)
the venue at the end but we know pocket (23:12 - 23:20)
will be there MH so there should be (23:15 - 23:22)
hopefully maybe a release date for (23:20 - 23:25)
pocket or I at the very lead least (23:22 - 23:28)
they&#39;ll say like fall or winter of this (23:25 - 23:31)
year or we&#39;re delaying (23:28 - 23:33)
it I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to delay (23:31 - 23:35)
it they told us this year (23:33 - 23:39)
so um yeah I don&#39;t know again I would (23:35 - 23:43)
like to see Something Za (23:39 - 23:43)
but I the the lack of a Pokemon presents (23:44 - 23:51)
makes it seem like I are they the lack (23:47 - 23:53)
of a Pokemon presents and the fact that (23:51 - 23:56)
I don&#39;t think any of us expect Za to be (23:53 - 24:00)
particularly competitive no right yeah (23:56 - 24:04)
no no unless they&#39;re going in a wild (24:00 - 24:07)
Direction with Za that nobody expected (24:04 - 24:09)
they could be going in a wild Direction (24:07 - 24:10)
but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the wild (24:09 - 24:12)
Direction anyone&#39;s expecting based off (24:10 - 24:14)
of what they&#39;ve said with the whole city (24:12 - 24:16)
building thing um (24:14 - 24:22)
yeah yeah so as much as I want Za news (24:16 - 24:24)
it&#39;s not the kind of news I expect to (24:22 - 24:29)
get at Worlds this year yeah (24:24 - 24:34)
yeah so and we we I do I do expect they (24:29 - 24:38)
will announce the September unite (24:34 - 24:40)
release oh yes we all sort of know what (24:38 - 24:41)
it is (24:40 - 24:45)
already so it&#39;s just confirming it well (24:41 - 24:48)
like last week we talked about a lot of (24:45 - 24:50)
things they did announce which would (24:48 - 24:53)
have made sense in a presents um and the (24:50 - 24:55)
only really things we don&#39;t know are (24:53 - 24:57)
unite (24:55 - 25:00)
Masters pock and (24:57 - 25:04)
Za uh cuz sleep did all their stuff even (25:00 - 25:05)
with the suun stuff you could be like (25:04 - 25:07)
why didn&#39;t they save that for a presents (25:05 - 25:11)
they&#39;ve put they put ente suun and (25:07 - 25:13)
raicho in the Pokemon Day stuff so it&#39;s (25:11 - 25:16)
like every time we get bigger some (25:13 - 25:18)
people might be like the Sleep news (25:16 - 25:19)
isn&#39;t that big (25:18 - 25:21)
it&#39;s adding a legendary Pokemon to sleep (25:19 - 25:24)
is big for the people who play SLE yeah (25:21 - 25:28)
yeah every time there has been like (25:24 - 25:31)
bigger Pokemon news like Mystery Dungeon (25:28 - 25:33)
yeah well I would say Mystery Dungeon on (25:31 - 25:35)
the eShop is not that big but I know (25:33 - 25:37)
people are very excited for it you just (25:35 - 25:40)
think of like (25:37 - 25:42)
huh another day without a Pokemon (25:40 - 25:46)
present but you&#39;re giving us big Pokemon (25:42 - 25:48)
news okay (25:46 - 25:52)
sure fine I guess but (25:48 - 25:55)
again I I I think this has been a (25:52 - 26:00)
lighter year mhm and I think that&#39;s (25:55 - 26:02)
okay (26:00 - 26:06)
um and I I said time and time again I I (26:02 - 26:08)
think if they want to make the 30th (26:06 - 26:11)
super impactful and super big and this (26:08 - 26:14)
huge Fanfare because there&#39;s a zero at (26:11 - 26:17)
the end of three yeah that there had to (26:14 - 26:19)
be a year that is (26:17 - 26:22)
light so they can catch up and so they (26:19 - 26:25)
can do things properly and I think this (26:22 - 26:27)
just happens to be this year and that&#39;s (26:25 - 26:30)
okay we want them to do things properly (26:27 - 26:32)
we want to end up with a game that&#39;s not (26:30 - 26:36)
like the bugs in scarlet and (26:32 - 26:40)
violet yeah and the (26:36 - 26:44)
25th was fun and the 20th was was super (26:40 - 26:47)
great like the 20th was sun and moon and (26:44 - 26:50)
Pokemon go and every mythical and (26:47 - 26:53)
GameStop had a new plush every week and (26:50 - 26:56)
a bunch of collaborations like that was (26:53 - 26:58)
a good year for Pokemon yeah I mean I (26:56 - 27:01)
mean the 30th leading up to the 30th is (26:58 - 27:02)
also going to be you know there&#39;s going (27:01 - 27:03)
to be a lot of things they&#39;re talking (27:02 - 27:06)
about like we the 30th anniversary is (27:03 - 27:09)
going to be a big big year I mean that&#39;s (27:06 - 27:12)
a huge milestone yeah and I mean they&#39;ve (27:09 - 27:13)
always gone all out for their Milestones (27:12 - 27:15)
I remember the 10th anniversary had a (27:13 - 27:18)
cross country tour thing that I went (27:15 - 27:21)
to so for all of these Milestones (27:18 - 27:23)
they&#39;ve tried to do something although I (27:21 - 27:25)
guess I don&#39;t particularly remember the (27:23 - 27:27)
15th (27:25 - 27:29)
but I was like (27:27 - 27:33)

black and white Mall (27:33 - 27:38)

think I went to all of the mall tours (27:38 - 27:42)

mall tours there&#39;s a Nintendo Mall tour (27:49 - 27:54)
coming to Mall of America and other (27:52 - 27:58)

on doing the train thing in Japan which (30:10 - 30:15)
was go to 36 stations and get the stamps (30:12 - 30:17)

they&#39;re they&#39;re much more ahead so maybe (30:39 - 30:45)
it&#39;s not spoilers but as somebody who is (30:42 - 30:48)
considering to do that stamp rally I was (30:45 - 30:52)
like huh okay all spoilers all spoilers (30:48 - 30:53)
got (30:52 - 30:55)
it it&#39;s great to be (30:53 - 31:00)
a a englishspeaking being Pokemon anime (30:55 - 31:01)
fan (31:00 - 31:04)
MH very specifically because not all (31:01 - 31:08)
anime have this problem right no they do (31:04 - 31:08)
not uh I think there is up to 40 English (31:09 - 31:17)
episodes now it looks like part one has (31:14 - 31:20)
12 episodes Part Two has 11 episodes and (31:17 - 31:24)
part three has 11 episodes so that&#39;s 34 (31:20 - 31:26)
episodes (31:24 - 31:29)
34 uh well that&#39;s that&#39;s out now so I (31:26 - 31:31)
guess you can binge watch it then cancel (31:29 - 31:35)
your Netflix I don&#39;t know when the the (31:31 - 31:38)
fourth series comes out probably before (31:35 - 31:40)
the end of the year there other good (31:38 - 31:43)
things on Netflix like you can are there (31:40 - 31:45)
there are some yeah I was told not to (31:43 - 31:47)
cancel for Umbrella Academy but then (31:45 - 31:49)
everyone online said it was bad and then (31:47 - 31:52)
I was like oh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t (31:49 - 31:54)
know just the last (31:52 - 31:57)
season but isn&#39;t the last season that&#39;s (31:54 - 31:58)
like what happened with Game of Thrones (31:57 - 32:00)
like the last season I feel like really (31:58 - 32:02)
makes or breaks a show yeah granted I (32:00 - 32:04)
haven&#39;t watched it yet but I have heard (32:02 - 32:06)
I have heard bad things about the last (32:04 - 32:09)
season I mean if you&#39;ve read the comic (32:06 - 32:11)
book you know what&#39;s happening and where (32:09 - 32:14)
they&#39;ve changed so oh is it not the same (32:11 - 32:16)
as the comic did they it&#39;s not no oh is (32:14 - 32:18)
that why people didn&#39;t like it yeah oh (32:16 - 32:20)
okay okay okay I think there&#39;s more (32:18 - 32:22)
reasons that people don&#39;t like more than (32:20 - 32:23)
that but (32:22 - 32:26)
also the so the difficulty is the comic (32:23 - 32:28)
is (32:26 - 32:31)
still going right a still going also be (32:28 - 32:35)
really really really weird like (32:31 - 32:38)
it&#39;s really weird and the TV show is (32:35 - 32:42)
just weird it&#39;s weird and also does (32:38 - 32:44)
things to keep like the general public (32:42 - 32:45)
not (32:44 - 32:47)
thinking why do you have John F Kennedy (32:45 - 32:50)
wandering through this background for no (32:47 - 32:52)
good reason which the comic just throws (32:50 - 32:54)
people in if you want a show that&#39;s (32:52 - 32:55)
really really really weird like that (32:54 - 32:58)
though Legends of Tomorrow highly (32:55 - 33:02)
recommend CU they they don&#39;t care I like (32:58 - 33:04)
watches this the first season was bad (33:02 - 33:07)
every other season was great similar to (33:04 - 33:10)
Umbrella Academy but more weird but more (33:07 - 33:13)
weird yeah Legends of Tomorrow is (33:10 - 33:15)
literally well a it was DC&#39;s comic where (33:13 - 33:16)
they&#39;re like we don&#39;t care what&#39;s (33:15 - 33:18)
happening and then became their TV show (33:16 - 33:19)
where we don&#39;t care what&#39;s happening (33:18 - 33:21)
just put money in it we need to keep (33:19 - 33:23)
them we need to keep the we just need to (33:21 - 33:26)
keep it going for whatever (33:23 - 33:29)
reason show this is going to be weird (33:26 - 33:34)

a lot of people but also that&#39;s not as (36:50 - 36:57)
high as many other places are asking for (36:53 - 36:59)
um but I think only three of these (36:57 - 37:03)
listed positions are Pok√©mon specific is (36:59 - 37:05)
what I&#39;m (37:03 - 37:10)

specifically laid out for Pokemon itself (37:10 - 37:16)

mhm and they did do a bunch of (37:32 - 37:39)
hiring after sun and moon and then they (37:36 - 37:42)
did a bunch more hiring after sword and (37:39 - 37:46)
shield and I&#39;m sure they hire here and (37:42 - 37:49)
there as it (37:46 - 37:52)
goes but I mean also they have you know (37:49 - 37:54)
a major (37:52 - 37:58)
event happening in 2026 that they may (37:54 - 38:01)
want to gear things up for and get (37:58 - 38:04)
people in working positions so that if (38:01 - 38:06)
they have a lot of announcements and new (38:04 - 38:08)
products and new artwork and new (38:06 - 38:11)
everything uh for a major event they (38:08 - 38:14)
would have that ready to (38:11 - 38:14)
go yeah uh I don&#39;t know what game (38:14 - 38:25)
freaks uh employee count is of now 207 (38:19 - 38:26)
as of (38:25 - 38:30)
2024 which is relatively small tiny (38:26 - 38:33)
office that is not a big company yeah (38:30 - 38:34)
and (38:33 - 38:38)
like uh to put that in perspective (38:34 - 38:40)
Bungie they may they they they make (38:38 - 38:43)
Destiny they used to make Halo before (38:40 - 38:45)
then 3 43 took over uh (38:43 - 38:52)
850 people and Destiny barely works that (38:45 - 38:52)
game that game has a has constant issues (38:53 - 39:00)
it has four times the amount of (38:57 - 39:03)
people um I don&#39;t know we I feel like we (39:00 - 39:05)
talk about this every time a Pokemon (39:03 - 39:07)
game comes up where people are like they (39:05 - 39:10)
should just hire more people uh that (39:07 - 39:13)
doesn&#39;t that just just doesn&#39;t like fix (39:10 - 39:18)
the issue yeah more complicated than (39:13 - 39:18)
that uh and then (39:19 - 39:25)
rockar they make uh this small very tiny (39:22 - 39:28)
game called Grand Theft Auto (39:25 - 39:33)
uh as of 2018 they have 2,000 (39:28 - 39:37)
employees just just very small Studio (39:33 - 39:40)
over there yes factor of 10 (39:37 - 39:44)
larger that&#39;s wild for every one person (39:40 - 39:48)
at game freak there&#39;s 10 people at (39:44 - 39:51)
Rockstar (39:48 - 39:51)
yeah I mean GTA 5 continues to make (39:51 - 39:59)
million ions of dollars every day with (39:57 - 40:02)
their online mhm (39:59 - 40:06)
whatever uh good for (40:02 - 40:06)
them and yet Pokemon is still the (40:08 - 40:11)
biggest (40:10 - 40:13)
franchise yes because Rockstar isn&#39;t (40:11 - 40:15)
selling plushes that&#39;s where they&#39;re (40:13 - 40:17)
missing out (40:15 - 40:21)
on 60% of all revenue is (40:17 - 40:26)
plushies plush more plush and uh Luc CR (40:21 - 40:31)
wear GTA L cruset crockpot is where they (40:26 - 40:32)
need to (40:31 - 40:36)
move do they what do they do for Grand (40:32 - 40:38)
Theft Auto merch I mean it&#39;s t-shirts (40:36 - 40:42)
right yeah gosh yeah I don&#39;t think I (40:38 - 40:44)
don&#39;t think merch matters as much as (40:42 - 40:46)
like the microtransactions in Grand (40:44 - 40:50)
Theft Auto online yeah all right I&#39;m new (40:46 - 40:52)
gear they have (40:50 - 40:55)
socks a bunch of hats I&#39;m adding it to (40:52 - 40:58)
my cart right now one of them string (40:55 - 41:00)
backpacking things that I hate so much (40:58 - 41:02)
oh and an (41:00 - 41:05)
ashtray you know out of all the merch (41:02 - 41:08)
you listed I think the ashtray makes the (41:05 - 41:11)
most sense for Grand Theft (41:08 - 41:15)
Auto connoisseurs I am taken a back that (41:11 - 41:18)
in the year (41:15 - 41:21)
2024 they just released an (41:18 - 41:24)
ashtray I think it&#39;s great it&#39;s very on (41:21 - 41:27)
brand honestly it is so unbrand but also (41:24 - 41:31)
[Laughter] (41:27 - 41:33)
you have single-handedly informed our (41:31 - 41:35)
audience that they could be don&#39;t go (41:33 - 41:38)
buying ashtray don&#39;t (41:35 - 41:41)
smoke just you could put other things in (41:38 - 41:45)
it you could put your keys in it you you (41:41 - 41:47)
could there&#39;s a lot of (41:45 - 41:50)
t-shirts this store a lot of t-shirts (41:47 - 41:53)
and a lot of baseball caps and an (41:50 - 41:56)
ashtray no plushies not a plushy to be S (41:53 - 41:58)
oh stickers no those are patches never (41:56 - 42:01)
mind not stickers (41:58 - 42:01)
patches I mean we we&#39;ve talked about (42:01 - 42:07)
when (42:04 - 42:07)
um the the the like Pokemon is the most (42:07 - 42:15)
successful media franchise in the (42:12 - 42:18)
world no one no one&#39;s debating that a (42:15 - 42:21)
lot and we&#39;re I&#39;m not exaggerating that (42:18 - 42:25)
the majority of their money comes from (42:21 - 42:29)
plushes or at least March merchandise (42:25 - 42:33)
yeah game (42:29 - 42:36)
wise when we talked about like Pokemon (42:33 - 42:40)
sleep it made a $100 million last (42:36 - 42:43)
year and that doesn&#39;t even come close to (42:40 - 42:46)
some of these other games like for (42:43 - 42:47)
example I have this pulled up off (42:46 - 42:54)
sensory reports hanai star rail made $52 (42:47 - 42:58)
million in April and then 66 sorry $66 (42:54 - 43:03)
million in April $52 million in May in (42:58 - 43:07)
two months hanai star rail made as much (43:03 - 43:11)
money as Pokemon sleep did in a year and (43:07 - 43:13)
hanai star rail not a new game it&#39;s been (43:11 - 43:18)
out for quite a while so (43:13 - 43:21)
like I I totally get the jokes of like (43:18 - 43:24)
small indd studio and maybe higher more (43:21 - 43:26)
they are small they have 200 people they (43:24 - 43:28)
are a small (43:26 - 43:31)
Studio but (43:28 - 43:35)
like there the if you kind of look if (43:31 - 43:37)
you look at how much gotcha games make I (43:35 - 43:40)
think Pokemon would like a piece of that (43:37 - 43:43)
but as and as much as me and Greg and (43:40 - 43:45)
other people like Pokemon (43:43 - 43:48)
Masters ah it it ain&#39;t coming it ain&#39;t (43:45 - 43:52)
coming close it is not nope no they have (43:48 - 43:55)
a gacha game it&#39;s just not not that kind (43:52 - 43:58)
of gacha game so I I always hate the (43:55 - 43:59)
like well you just slap Pokemon on it it (43:58 - 44:01)
makes a ton of (43:59 - 44:05)
money h i mean it makes some money yeah (44:01 - 44:07)
it definitely makes money but not as (44:05 - 44:10)
much as like like look at some of these (44:07 - 44:12)
gotta games look at Grand Theft Auto (44:10 - 44:13)
look at even like I think Destiny does (44:12 - 44:15)
make a lot of money even though people (44:13 - 44:17)
don&#39;t like that (44:15 - 44:20)
but Pokemon Masters here we (44:17 - 44:24)
go so I said hanai made 66 million in (44:20 - 44:29)
April made 52 million in May (44:24 - 44:31)
oh my gosh hold on Masters is so down on (44:29 - 44:32)
the list I lost it (44:31 - 44:36)
again keep scrolling in April Masters (44:32 - 44:40)
made 1.7 (44:36 - 44:43)
million not 50 not 66 million and then (44:40 - 44:47)
in May it made 1.6 million I mean that&#39;s (44:43 - 44:50)
still a million it&#39;s yeah yeah still (44:47 - 44:53)
it&#39;s still good but when (44:50 - 44:57)
your your whole game is selling people (44:53 - 44:59)
digital characters and another game is (44:57 - 45:03)
doing that 50 times over yeah and you&#39;re (44:59 - 45:05)
the biggest IP in the (45:03 - 45:07)
world and the other one just came out a (45:05 - 45:09)
year (45:07 - 45:12)
ago something (45:09 - 45:16)
is those numbers are not close at (45:12 - 45:18)
all (45:16 - 45:21)
um but (45:18 - 45:21)
yeah uh also China&#39;s a big Market (45:22 - 45:27)
because if you look at this list yeah (45:25 - 45:30)
China is up there as like the majority (45:27 - 45:35)
spending money in said in those said (45:30 - 45:38)
games also Dragon Ball making 10 million (45:35 - 45:41)
in April and 7 million in May I don&#39;t (45:38 - 45:43)
know who&#39;s playing Dragon Ball Z dokan (45:41 - 45:46)
battle but they are doing 10 times (45:43 - 45:50)
better than Master (45:46 - 45:50)
X Summoner Wars how are they making 11 (45:52 - 45:58)
million and then 10 Mill well the last (45:55 - 46:00)
time I heard summer rewards was like six (45:58 - 46:02)
years ago at Gen Con who is play who is (46:00 - 46:04)
giving this game (46:02 - 46:07)
money puzzle of dragons is making 17 (46:04 - 46:11)
million yeah like it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s just (46:07 - 46:14)
crazy to think about how Pokemon is this (46:11 - 46:19)
huge Goliath of an IP and it&#39;s Gotta (46:14 - 46:23)
game doesn&#39;t even come close to these (46:19 - 46:26)
other gotcha games it&#39;s (46:23 - 46:28)
crazy it&#39;s (46:26 - 46:30)
insane kind of (46:28 - 46:32)
insane it&#39;s one of the things where it&#39;s (46:30 - 46:34)
like I (46:32 - 46:38)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t know how Pokemon (46:34 - 46:42)
company fit gets the gap of getting (46:38 - 46:44)
people out of one Silo and into the (46:42 - 46:47)
mobile Silo because there&#39;s no reason (46:44 - 46:51)
like Master&#39;s play style is pretty it is (46:47 - 46:52)
pretty good it&#39;s (46:51 - 46:56)
not you know difficult it can as I&#39;ve (46:52 - 46:59)
learned as they&#39;re doing their damage (46:56 - 47:01)
event so they can see how people are (46:59 - 47:04)
doing I am so casual in that game there (47:01 - 47:06)
are people posting online like I did a (47:04 - 47:08)
million damage in the two minutes I have (47:06 - 47:11)
and I&#39;m like I got (47:08 - 47:15)
50,000 so I am so casual and I still get (47:11 - 47:19)
a lot out of that game I&#39;m just there is (47:15 - 47:21)
such a (47:19 - 47:25)
weird sense of I also think there&#39;s so (47:21 - 47:29)
many mobile things of Pokemon to pay (47:25 - 47:32)
attention to that adding another one no (47:29 - 47:35)
matter how good it is like people say to (47:32 - 47:37)
me it just feels like it&#39;s G to be like (47:35 - 47:40)
I&#39;m G to spend 30 minutes in Masters I&#39;m (47:37 - 47:42)
like I spend 10 minutes every day I (47:40 - 47:44)
spend less time in sleep and I don&#39;t do (47:42 - 47:47)
go every day but because there&#39;s so many (47:44 - 47:50)
of them people feel like I&#39;m spending an (47:47 - 47:55)
hour in Mobile Pokemon games and it&#39;s (47:50 - 47:57)
good that there&#39;s so many but like you (47:55 - 47:58)
know (47:57 - 48:01)
I but I do has one and they have their (47:58 - 48:04)
people that pay them a ton of money I do (48:01 - 48:06)
feel like everyone who plays genin also (48:04 - 48:09)
plays hanai also plays zzz I do feel (48:06 - 48:14)
like there&#39;s overlap in yeah do overlap (48:09 - 48:15)
between those (48:14 - 48:18)
games uh I think they reference each (48:15 - 48:22)
other they&#39;re all they&#39;re all Hoya verse (48:18 - 48:25)
Masters is I feel like more of a game (48:22 - 48:27)
for more intense Pokemon players that (48:25 - 48:29)
you play Masters and like playing (48:27 - 48:32)
Masters more if you know the characters (48:29 - 48:34)
and you only know more of the characters (48:32 - 48:36)
if you&#39;ve played more of the games and (48:34 - 48:38)
that on top of the fact that even if (48:36 - 48:40)
your favorite Pokemon is in Masters it (48:38 - 48:42)
might be paired with a character you do (48:40 - 48:46)
not care about at all or actively (48:42 - 48:48)
dislike and so they have kind of (48:46 - 48:52)
sacrificed their main poll with Pokemon (48:48 - 48:54)
which is you being connected to your (48:52 - 48:57)
favorite Pokemon by putting this middle (48:54 - 48:59)
thing which is characters who you may or (48:57 - 49:02)
may not care about in master I mean no (48:59 - 49:04)
one cares about the butler with the star (49:02 - 49:06)
rptor at great he&#39;s a great unit I (49:04 - 49:08)
remember I don&#39;t even remember his (49:06 - 49:11)
name I think I think the other thing and (49:08 - 49:12)
I hate saying this but I think the other (49:11 - 49:16)
thing is other gotcha games do a lot of (49:12 - 49:18)
pandering like Masters does not have (49:16 - 49:21)
Giovani in a swimsuit giovan in a (49:18 - 49:23)
swimsuit does exist in the anime and (49:21 - 49:26)
should be brought to Masters as a as a (49:23 - 49:27)
summer (49:26 - 49:30)
costume I don&#39;t know why we need Giovani (49:27 - 49:34)
with his with his Sharpedo that is that (49:30 - 49:36)
is Anime lore that needs to be brought (49:34 - 49:40)
to Masters and I believe it would sell (49:36 - 49:41)
that would be that would be like a $5 (49:40 - 49:44)
million a month right there yeah they (49:41 - 49:48)
they are very but but yeah but in their (49:44 - 49:50)
outfits and their swim outfits are very (49:48 - 49:54)
modest yeah modest is a very good word (49:50 - 49:57)
compared to compared to other got (49:54 - 49:59)
yeah compared to what else exists out (49:57 - 50:01)
there they are very (49:59 - 50:03)
modest and I don&#39;t think they can be (50:01 - 50:09)
less so really I don&#39;t think they can be (50:03 - 50:09)
but (50:09 - 50:15)
uh Scarlet Violet news this the summer (50:11 - 50:17)
the summer of scarlet and violet is (50:15 - 50:19)
still happening we&#39;re on week three now (50:17 - 50:22)
which is uh chest form gim ghoul are in (50:19 - 50:25)
teror raid battles it is exactly the (50:22 - 50:27)
same as last time (50:25 - 50:31)
which means that uh gim ghoul is in one (50:27 - 50:33)
to five star raids only the five star (50:31 - 50:36)
raids can be shiny it is still a one in (50:33 - 50:42)
4,000 chance of gimi ghoul to be shiny (50:36 - 50:45)
uh they did add one change which is (50:42 - 50:48)
gimme goul now drops urb mystica it (50:45 - 50:49)
looks like it&#39;s a 3% chance and it&#39;s (50:48 - 50:52)
only bitter urbam mystica it&#39;s not (50:49 - 50:55)
random like the sevenstar raids (50:52 - 51:00)
so there is a reason to do (50:55 - 51:03)
that um that goes (51:00 - 51:07)
until Thursday August 22nd and then (51:03 - 51:10)
after that will be the Seven Star normal (51:07 - 51:14)
Terra Dragonite which sometime this week (51:10 - 51:16)
there should be my RAID build video for (51:14 - 51:18)
Dragonite really really hard to build (51:16 - 51:20)
for Dragonite early since Dragonite can (51:18 - 51:22)
literally (51:20 - 51:25)
learn way too many moves and it has (51:22 - 51:27)
amazing coverage (51:25 - 51:29)
there&#39;s also the outbreak event which is (51:27 - 51:33)
K in blueberry Riolu (51:29 - 51:37)
in uh kit kitami and (51:33 - 51:40)
then watl in (51:37 - 51:43)
Pala those this is the first event ever (51:40 - 51:46)
that has both increased shiny (51:43 - 51:48)
odds uh which I posted those on (51:46 - 51:51)
Instagram and Twitter and threads I (51:48 - 51:53)
don&#39;t know them off the top of my head (51:51 - 51:57)
um but also increased Mark chance (51:53 - 52:01)
so uh it&#39;s a 5% chance for the Pumped up (51:57 - 52:02)
Mark which means that if you catch a (52:01 - 52:04)
shiny there&#39;s a one in 20 chance that (52:02 - 52:06)
your shiny would have the Pumped up Mark (52:04 - 52:07)
technically higher than that because it (52:06 - 52:10)
could also have other marks but the (52:07 - 52:12)
Pumped up Mark rolls separately than the (52:10 - 52:16)
other so if you like to Mark hunt (52:12 - 52:19)
shinies or you like the Pumped up Mark (52:16 - 52:22)
or you think pumped up Mark on Riolu is (52:19 - 52:26)
cool then you should go do that before (52:22 - 52:29)
that ends (52:26 - 52:29)
um but then the next week or the dragon (52:29 - 52:35)
week that will also be increase shiny (52:32 - 52:37)
plus increase Mark as (52:35 - 52:41)
well so then we don&#39;t know what&#39;s (52:37 - 52:44)
happening after the summer is over (52:41 - 52:49)
but that&#39;s uh that&#39;s happening right (52:44 - 52:49)
now uh so that&#39;s (52:50 - 52:55)
cool there was probably something else I (52:53 - 52:57)
was trying to remember (52:55 - 53:00)
that went with (52:57 - 53:00)
that I can&#39;t think of it get your F Coco (53:03 - 53:10)
they F Coco spatio qule from the anime (53:06 - 53:12)
you can download all of (53:10 - 53:14)
those for a while doesn&#39;t that last for (53:12 - 53:17)
a long time yeah till next year the (53:14 - 53:21)
spatio ends in September oh the very end (53:17 - 53:23)
of September but the other two are yeah (53:21 - 53:27)
next year yeah cuz we got Leos spto so (53:23 - 53:31)
early it was a while ago oh yeah yeah (53:27 - 53:34)
yeah four worlds anyone will be able to (53:31 - 53:37)
get the Sylveon that was the champion (53:34 - 53:40)
Sylveon for the seniors (53:37 - 53:44)
division um I don&#39;t know why the Masters (53:40 - 53:46)
didn&#39;t get picked this year maybe (53:44 - 53:47)
because they use gastron I don&#39;t (53:46 - 53:48)
actually remember their team I don&#39;t (53:47 - 53:50)
think it was a gastron but we&#39;re get so (53:48 - 53:51)
anyone can get a (53:50 - 53:55)
silveon that&#39;s that&#39;s there if you&#39;re at (53:51 - 53:58)
Worlds don&#39;t know how they&#39;re doing it (53:55 - 54:02)
this year I will I I can say at London (53:58 - 54:04)
you had to at London at Washington DC (54:02 - 54:08)
and at Nashville and at San Diego I&#39;m (54:04 - 54:09)
just trying to remember all the worlds I (54:08 - 54:10)
went to you would either have to bring (54:09 - 54:12)
your switch and your 3DS into the (54:10 - 54:15)
convention hall connect to a very bad (54:12 - 54:16)
Wi-Fi network that everyone else was (54:15 - 54:19)
trying to connect to eventually download (54:16 - 54:23)
your Pokemon and then you would be (54:19 - 54:26)
good and that was for like Victini or (54:23 - 54:30)
not Victini London was um Sin Sin (54:26 - 54:34)
siny for Yokohama last year they were (54:30 - 54:36)
giving out little cards for taguri (54:34 - 54:38)
because that was the (54:36 - 54:43)
Pokemon so if steeny is the same way for (54:38 - 54:45)
inperson events it&#39;s a water terot type (54:43 - 54:47)
steeny with safety goggles as a held (54:45 - 54:49)
item which is like really cute because (54:47 - 54:50)
that&#39;s what the artwork is is steeny (54:49 - 54:55)
with like scuba gear on yeah cute so (54:50 - 54:57)
hopefully they&#39;re handing out (54:55 - 54:59)
cards uh cuz they were really generous (54:57 - 55:02)
in Yokohama like you would just be (54:59 - 55:03)
walking past the McDonald&#39;s and somebody (55:02 - 55:05)
would be standing on the corner handing (55:03 - 55:07)
out cards for tagui you&#39;d be at like an (55:05 - 55:09)
ice cream shop in the mall and you&#39;d (55:07 - 55:10)
walk out of the mall and somebody&#39;s like (55:09 - 55:12)
here&#39;s like four tasu like we&#39;re just (55:10 - 55:14)
trying to get rid of these they printed (55:12 - 55:17)
so many tagui and these people were (55:14 - 55:19)
everywhere just handing them out so it (55:17 - 55:21)
was really nice because I was able to (55:19 - 55:22)
get a bunch and then like put them in (55:21 - 55:24)
the Discord in the slack for people to (55:22 - 55:26)
like redeem first come first serve so if (55:24 - 55:29)
that&#39;s the case you might be able to get (55:26 - 55:33)
a tuser or you might be able to get a (55:29 - 55:35)
steeny if you&#39;re not going if you know (55:33 - 55:40)
somebody who is going and that&#39;s cool um (55:35 - 55:42)
but they always do like a Pokemon that&#39;s (55:40 - 55:45)
like you don&#39;t feel like terribly bad (55:42 - 55:47)
missing I think one year for Hawaii they (55:45 - 55:50)
gave out like a len (55:47 - 55:54)
exeggutor uh but that&#39;s happening and (55:50 - 55:58)
then twitch for the week of Hawaii we&#39;ll (55:54 - 56:02)
have drops for both Pokemon go and the (55:58 - 56:05)
Pokemon Trading Card Game um so you&#39;ll (56:02 - 56:07)
be able to (56:05 - 56:10)
watch any of well I think you have to (56:07 - 56:11)
watch the Pokemon go channel for the (56:10 - 56:13)
Pokemon go drops and then I think you (56:11 - 56:15)
have to watch uh the TCG channel for the (56:13 - 56:18)

VGC channel it&#39;s just going to show you (56:18 - 56:22)
the silveon code and rotation so you (56:20 - 56:24)

going in the main chat and being like (56:56 - 57:03)
what&#39;s happening and somebody being (56:59 - 57:03)
like how do you not know that fake out (57:04 - 57:08)

no one would even respond to you yeah oh (57:10 - 57:17)
yeah or it&#39;s just like half the comments (57:14 - 57:19)
being like when&#39;s Wolfie competing (57:17 - 57:21)
brother he already got eliminated like (57:19 - 57:22)
two days (57:21 - 57:25)
ago like he&#39;s not (57:22 - 57:27)
competing um so yeah worlds should be (57:25 - 57:30)
exciting there&#39;s a bunch of stuff (57:27 - 57:32)
happening uh the outbreak stuff is (57:30 - 57:35)
cool um yeah I think I think that&#39;s (57:32 - 57:37)
everything for worlds all right let&#39;s (57:35 - 57:38)
take one more break and then we have (57:37 - 57:41)
Pokemon go news and then I also want to (57:38 - 57:43)
share my thoughts about legendary (57:41 - 57:45)
Pokemon and Scarlet and violet so more (57:43 - 57:49)
scarlet and violet crazy uh we will be (57:45 - 57:52)
right back and we are back from our (57:49 - 57:54)
break all right before we get to the (57:52 - 57:58)
Pok√©mon go news I did a weeklong stream (57:54 - 58:01)
on Twitch and in that weeklong (57:58 - 58:04)
stream I had one simple goal was was to (58:01 - 58:07)
get a shiny jumbo karant which I did get (58:04 - 58:10)
her she&#39;s a queen she&#39;s she&#39;s very large (58:07 - 58:14)
we did it uh now my my I did not get a (58:10 - 58:17)
destiny Mark karant unfortunately cuz (58:14 - 58:20)
what&#39;s destiny Mark Destiny Mark is when (58:17 - 58:22)
your birthday so when you go to the (58:20 - 58:25)
Pokemon Center and it says like happy (58:22 - 58:27)
birthday that once it does once it (58:25 - 58:29)
triggers that happy birthday uh all the (58:27 - 58:33)
Pokemon for your birthday will have a uh (58:29 - 58:35)
I think it&#39;s like a one in eight chance (58:33 - 58:39)
of having a destiny Mark which is cool (58:35 - 58:41)
so my goal for my next birthday is to (58:39 - 58:42)
get a (58:41 - 58:46)
tiny Destiny Mark cram amazing so I can (58:42 - 58:49)
have the smallest cram and then the (58:46 - 58:51)
biggest cram shiny still be next year (58:49 - 58:54)
shiny still yeah yeah yeah I also want I (58:51 - 58:57)
also want to just I don&#39;t like changing (58:54 - 59:00)
my date because it like it&#39;s the same (58:57 - 59:03)
weird mental gymnastics I have of (59:00 - 59:05)
like like I don&#39;t want to like hack in (59:03 - 59:08)
an old C map to then hunt Mew to be like (59:05 - 59:10)
I hunted Mew legitimately because at the (59:08 - 59:11)
because people would be like well how (59:10 - 59:12)
did you do it and then I&#39;d have to bring (59:11 - 59:16)
up like oh I I did this one bad part (59:12 - 59:18)
before some people don&#39;t care right for (59:16 - 59:21)
me like I think the story of the Pokemon (59:18 - 59:24)
is more exciting so like I you could (59:21 - 59:26)
switch it to your birthday at any time (59:24 - 59:28)
right like you could just go into your (59:26 - 59:29)
switch and be like it&#39;s my birthday and (59:28 - 59:31)
you can get as many Destiny Mark Pokemon (59:29 - 59:33)
as you want but I do really want to like (59:31 - 59:36)
remember my birthday Pokemon as Pokemon (59:33 - 59:39)
on my birthday so it&#39;s like I have like (59:36 - 59:41)
40 Destiny Mark Pokemon H some of them (59:39 - 59:44)
were in September that&#39;s not my birthday (59:41 - 59:47)
so so if if if you want to do that (59:44 - 59:48)
that&#39;s cool I&#39;m just saying why I don&#39;t (59:47 - 59:50)
want to do it so I look forward to my (59:48 - 59:52)
birthday cuz then I can kind of pick and (59:50 - 59:54)
choose like what I want to get or not (59:52 - 59:56)
get I ended up getting a non shiny (59:54 - 59:58)
Destiny Mark Starley because I was (59:56 - 60:01)
testing to make sure it was working so (59:58 - 60:03)
shout out to that little bird he now (60:01 - 60:06)
lives in my Pokemon home living decks as (60:03 - 60:09)
Destiny Mark sh Starly anyways um so (60:06 - 60:12)
after I got shiny jumbo (60:09 - 60:15)
crime (60:12 - 60:17)
I decided because I was streaming so (60:15 - 60:19)
much that like when when people were (60:17 - 60:21)
starting to go to bed and it was like 2: (60:19 - 60:22)
a.m. I was like I&#39;m just going to (60:21 - 60:24)
organize my Pok√©mon home cuz I&#39;m tired (60:22 - 60:25)
everyone else is tired this is really (60:24 - 60:28)
chill no one missing like high energy (60:25 - 60:30)
content cuz it&#39;s the middle of the night (60:28 - 60:32)
and then I got into completely (60:30 - 60:35)
organizing my Pokemon home because I (60:32 - 60:38)
never cannot because before before (60:35 - 60:40)
scarlet and violet came out I had it all (60:38 - 60:43)
organized everything was in order up to (60:40 - 60:45)
scarlet and violet I got the Poke Ball (60:43 - 60:47)
MCA and everything originally back in (60:45 - 60:50)
sword and shield because I think I think (60:47 - 60:52)
you only need up to before like Reggie (60:50 - 60:54)
Eli Reggie Drago I don&#39;t even think you (60:52 - 60:56)
need those technically because they (60:54 - 60:58)
weren&#39;t added with the DLC so whatever (60:56 - 61:01)
sword and shield was base no DLC I think (60:58 - 61:05)
was still to this day is how it works (61:01 - 61:07)
don&#39;t know you can only get one MCA and (61:05 - 61:09)
then I never organized gen n even though (61:07 - 61:11)
I completed the Gen 9 Pokedex so (61:09 - 61:13)
obviously I have all the Gen 9 Pokemon (61:11 - 61:15)
so I started organizing everything and (61:13 - 61:18)
then I realized oh once this is done I&#39;m (61:15 - 61:20)
going to have to organize a shiny living (61:18 - 61:23)
decks which I want to do but then I (61:20 - 61:26)
realized that half of my living decks (61:23 - 61:29)
had shinies in it like oh I have a shiny (61:26 - 61:31)
togaru here I have a shiny unknown here (61:29 - 61:34)
I have like a shiny Zama zenta here so I (61:31 - 61:37)
need to like move those out and so now (61:34 - 61:39)
I&#39;m I have a bunch of holes in my living (61:37 - 61:41)
Decks that were not just I don&#39;t have (61:39 - 61:44)
the non shiny version of that (61:41 - 61:47)
Pokemon and one of the Pokemon I was (61:44 - 61:49)
missing was kup Fu because I I played (61:47 - 61:53)
through scarland Violet twice but I (61:49 - 61:55)
evolved one into the water she and one (61:53 - 61:57)
into the the the fighting U so I was (61:55 - 61:59)
like oh I need another Cub Fu and I was (61:57 - 62:02)
like oh I can just get Cub Fu in scarlet (61:59 - 62:07)
and violet that&#39;s great um so after I (62:02 - 62:08)
caught (62:07 - 62:12)
kubfu I was like oh uh ver Cobalion is (62:08 - 62:14)
like literally right above Cub Fu (62:12 - 62:15)
they&#39;re like in the same area of the (62:14 - 62:17)
forest I was like ah I&#39;m already here (62:15 - 62:19)
I&#39;ll just catch calan this started me (62:17 - 62:21)
catching every legendary Pokemon in the (62:19 - 62:24)
game that didn&#39;t have to happen that&#39;s (62:21 - 62:28)
on you it didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t but I (62:24 - 62:28)
but I would I&#39;m I&#39;m just making up (62:28 - 62:33)
statistics like I always do I would (62:31 - 62:35)
guess that 90% of the people listening (62:33 - 62:38)
to this podcast told themselves that (62:35 - 62:41)
they were going to shiny hunt all the (62:38 - 62:44)
legendaries in Pokemon sun and moon and (62:41 - 62:46)
the reason they didn&#39;t catch any Pokemon (62:44 - 62:48)
in Ultra Sun Ultra moon is because they (62:46 - 62:49)
were going to shiny hunt them and I (62:48 - 62:51)
would bet that almost everyone listening (62:49 - 62:54)
to the this podcast never actually (62:51 - 62:56)
caught those legendary Pokemon and then (62:54 - 62:58)
then sword and shield came out and those (62:56 - 62:59)
same people were like well I&#39;m going to (62:58 - 63:01)
shiny hunt those legendary Pokemon in (62:59 - 63:02)
sword and shield and they went through (63:01 - 63:04)
Dynamax adventure and it wasn&#39;t shiny (63:02 - 63:06)
and then they never caught them and I (63:04 - 63:08)
think it&#39;s the same here where people (63:06 - 63:11)
are like I&#39;m eventually going to do this (63:08 - 63:14)
and then they never do it because I can (63:11 - 63:15)
I&#39;ll tell you right now I think out of (63:14 - 63:17)
all the legendary Pokemon in in sword (63:15 - 63:19)
and shield I think I caught like four (63:17 - 63:20)
because the other ones weren&#39;t shiny so (63:19 - 63:23)
I ran away sun and moon same thing I (63:20 - 63:25)
didn&#39;t catch that Mewtwo I didn&#39;t catch (63:23 - 63:27)
that zaptos I didn&#39;t catch that I didn&#39;t (63:25 - 63:30)
catch any of them cuz I told myself I (63:27 - 63:33)
was going to and then I never did and (63:30 - 63:35)
now we&#39;re three games later and I think (63:33 - 63:37)
a lot of the audience listening to the (63:35 - 63:39)
show did the same thing as me of like oh (63:37 - 63:41)
I&#39;m gonna catch them and then the next (63:39 - 63:43)
game comes out and then you never do so (63:41 - 63:44)
I was like you know what they can&#39;t be (63:43 - 63:45)
shiny (63:44 - 63:48)
anyways and I I can catch them in the (63:45 - 63:52)
cool pokeballs so I&#39;m going to do that (63:48 - 63:55)
but I will say this is what I did I I (63:52 - 63:59)
didn&#39;t look up on Cabe or Bulbapedia or (63:55 - 64:01)
anything I didn&#39;t look at any Maps I (63:59 - 64:04)
talked to (64:01 - 64:04)
[Music] (64:05 - 64:08)
and I was like oh I I you&#39;re new here (64:26 - 64:30)
but like I was trying to do it without (64:28 - 64:31)
looking it up and they&#39;re like oh sorry (64:30 - 64:36)
didn&#39;t mean to but I genuinely (64:31 - 64:39)
had some of the most fun I think I&#39;ve (64:36 - 64:42)
had in scarlet and violet by doing that (64:39 - 64:47)
by going off snackworks hints and then (64:42 - 64:49)
re-exploring (64:47 - 64:52)
Pala and I I&#39;m sure it was like a (64:49 - 64:54)
long-term thing to be like well we&#39;re (64:52 - 64:55)
going to put these legendary Pokemon (64:54 - 64:57)
here (64:55 - 64:58)
initially like I don&#39;t think they (64:57 - 65:00)
thought of it last minute of like ah (64:58 - 65:01)
what are we going to do with legendary (65:00 - 65:02)
Pokemon let&#39;s just like stick them right (65:01 - 65:05)
here uh but I do think where they put (65:02 - 65:09)
the the legendary Pokemon and the (65:05 - 65:12)
clues I I had so much fun actually (65:09 - 65:14)
finding them and then when I got to them (65:12 - 65:16)
catching them was like a nightmare (65:14 - 65:17)
because it&#39;s all like catch rate three (65:16 - 65:20)
and and (65:17 - 65:24)
whatever uh but I really did (65:20 - 65:27)
like explore boring pal day and there (65:24 - 65:28)
were there were still you know I have I (65:27 - 65:30)
have a thousand plus hours in scarlet (65:28 - 65:32)
and violet there were still some places (65:30 - 65:35)
where I was like I I&#39;ve never been here (65:32 - 65:39)
I have you have no reason to be here but (65:35 - 65:41)
like I didn&#39;t it&#39;s yeah I was like I (65:39 - 65:43)
didn&#39;t know that there was like a tunnel (65:41 - 65:45)
here or I didn&#39;t know there was like a (65:43 - 65:48)
cave over here (65:45 - 65:53)
um and it gave a little bit more lore to (65:48 - 65:56)
Pala that I wasn&#39;t expecting there&#39;s (65:53 - 65:57)
like a legend there&#39;s like a one of (65:56 - 66:00)
sorry this is maybe slightly spoilers to (65:57 - 66:02)
some people who may want to do what I (66:00 - 66:04)
just did there&#39;s like one of snack (66:02 - 66:08)
Worth&#39;s like uh stories is like uh this (66:04 - 66:12)
Pokemon is looking over this city carved (66:08 - 66:14)
into the mountain and everyone in the (66:12 - 66:15)
city is like really (66:14 - 66:18)
hardworking and it like I sat there and (66:15 - 66:20)
I was like well there&#39;s only so many (66:18 - 66:22)
cities in Pala and there&#39;s only so many (66:20 - 66:26)
cities like carved into mountains and (66:22 - 66:29)
like what would be hardworking like I (66:26 - 66:33)
don&#39;t think like eono city of lencia (66:29 - 66:34)
like I don&#39;t those people never struck (66:33 - 66:38)
me as hardworking so it&#39;s (66:34 - 66:40)
like it&#39;s kind of like that missing (66:38 - 66:43)
thing that pal Pala I I think Pala is (66:40 - 66:46)
missing compared to other Pokemon games (66:43 - 66:47)
where like when you get to like a city (66:46 - 66:49)
in black and white or even like I think (66:47 - 66:50)
the the city that stands out in people&#39;s (66:49 - 66:53)
mind is um GL the the city after glim (66:50 - 66:56)
would tangle in sword and shield with (66:53 - 66:57)
all the mushrooms and stuff mhm the glow (66:56 - 67:00)
mushrooms you don&#39;t even need lore for (66:57 - 67:02)
that City you get in and you like feel (67:00 - 67:03)
it you&#39;re like oh my gosh this city is (67:02 - 67:05)
so cool it&#39;s so beautiful like I want to (67:03 - 67:08)
live here kind of city um and I don&#39;t (67:05 - 67:10)
think the Legends in scarlet and violet (67:08 - 67:15)
like fixes that issue but like that just (67:10 - 67:17)
like simple line of dialogue of like the (67:15 - 67:19)
people in the city is really hardworking (67:17 - 67:21)
and they carved their City out of the (67:19 - 67:23)
mountain makes it feel like that sounds (67:21 - 67:26)
like a city I want to go to and like (67:23 - 67:31)
that&#39;s more that like one sentence of (67:26 - 67:35)
lore would have done you so much good (67:31 - 67:37)
maybe if it was given to you at the (67:35 - 67:39)
beginning of the game I don&#39;t I&#39;m (67:37 - 67:42)
curious if any of the NPCs say it (67:39 - 67:43)
because I&#39;ve talked to most of the NPCs (67:42 - 67:45)
and I don&#39;t think I remember that but (67:43 - 67:47)
it&#39;s also been a while at this point (67:45 - 67:51)
yeah I don&#39;t but yeah the map is Big (67:47 - 67:54)
Pala is is a large region and there are (67:51 - 67:56)
a lot of places to explore I remember I (67:54 - 67:59)
had a ton of fun flying around and or (67:56 - 68:01)
running around and getting all the (67:59 - 68:03)
flying points and at this point with the (68:01 - 68:06)
actual flying feature I would imagine (68:03 - 68:08)
finding things is even more (68:06 - 68:13)
fun yeah it was it was uh ey opening to (68:08 - 68:15)
go back to CU I went I had to go back to (68:13 - 68:17)
Scarlet for version exclusives obviously (68:15 - 68:20)
and I was like oh I I don&#39;t have flying (68:17 - 68:22)
unlocked I don&#39;t have this unlocked I (68:20 - 68:24)
don&#39;t have my like uh blueberry camera (68:22 - 68:28)
unlocked and traversing the world when (68:24 - 68:30)
you can no longer fly like when that&#39;s (68:28 - 68:33)
taken away from you when you&#39;re so used (68:30 - 68:33)
to (68:33 - 68:37)
it you&#39;re you&#39;re just (68:33 - 68:39)
like I can&#39;t talk about this pain I (68:37 - 68:42)
can&#39;t I was like I I I just want to fly (68:39 - 68:45)
I can&#39;t talk pain it&#39;s every exp this is (68:42 - 68:48)
a very Greg&#39;s probably relating to Final (68:45 - 68:50)
Fantasy where they take away your flying (68:48 - 68:53)
when you enter a new area expansion I am (68:50 - 68:56)
forced to walk (68:53 - 69:00)
like a common peasant from point to (68:56 - 69:03)
point I I have a gorilla that flies I (69:00 - 69:07)
have a gorilla that flies and they won&#39;t (69:03 - 69:10)
let me fly until I find some (69:07 - 69:15)
mystical wind swirl on the edge of some (69:10 - 69:18)
City or I talk to Sarah and she&#39;s like (69:15 - 69:21)
hey thanks for bringing me soup now you (69:18 - 69:26)
can fly just maddening (69:21 - 69:26)
yeah I I I I like how they did the (69:28 - 69:34)
Legends I think it&#39;s really cool I think (69:31 - 69:36)
it&#39;s way cooler than like you know in X (69:34 - 69:38)
and Y you just find Mewtwo or you just (69:36 - 69:40)
find zygard at the end of the cave and (69:38 - 69:42)
that&#39;s it I think (69:40 - 69:45)
like where they place them on the map (69:42 - 69:47)
and giving them like this little story (69:45 - 69:50)
and then going there and being like cool (69:47 - 69:51)
like I&#39;ve never been here before I&#39;ve (69:50 - 69:52)
never been to this part of the map I (69:51 - 69:54)
think that&#39;s (69:52 - 69:59)
great uh the shiny lock (69:54 - 69:59)
obviously made a lot of people upset (69:59 - 70:04)
even before this game I mean I made a i (70:01 - 70:06)
i i joke that like no one caught those (70:04 - 70:08)
Pokemon in sun and moon or or or sword (70:06 - 70:10)
and shield like part of the reason I (70:08 - 70:12)
didn&#39;t need to catch those Pokemon is (70:10 - 70:13)
because I I have all the shinies from (70:12 - 70:16)
some game or another so like me (70:13 - 70:19)
personally wasn&#39;t affected by the shiny (70:16 - 70:20)
lock I mean the only one I would have (70:19 - 70:23)
probably hunted would be like KB Fu and (70:20 - 70:25)
the horses so three Pokemon out of all (70:23 - 70:26)
of them (70:25 - 70:30)
um but I do I do think it was cool the (70:26 - 70:31)
other thing I realized because I had to (70:30 - 70:33)
go back to scarlet and I had to play (70:31 - 70:35)
through some of that is I kind of forgot (70:33 - 70:39)
all about the blood moon URS saluna (70:35 - 70:42)
fight and go doing the blood moon URS (70:39 - 70:45)
saluna fight and then going and finding (70:42 - 70:48)
the Legends was so jarring to (70:45 - 70:51)
me because the Blood Moon ursal Luna (70:48 - 70:53)
fight is set up like a Titan battle so (70:51 - 70:56)
it has like five 10 I don&#39;t know how (70:53 - 70:58)
many times the HP but you can&#39;t simply (70:56 - 71:01)
just like one shot it like URS saluna (70:58 - 71:04)
can still like set up and call mind and (71:01 - 71:06)
kind of knock out one or two (71:04 - 71:08)
Pokemon (71:06 - 71:13)
and that fight was more like epic and (71:08 - 71:15)
exciting than any of the fights with the (71:13 - 71:19)
Legends which blood moon blood moon or (71:15 - 71:22)
saluna very cool very cool Pokemon but (71:19 - 71:27)
also not a legendary Pokemon Y (71:22 - 71:29)
so like (71:27 - 71:32)
I it also reminds me of like the fights (71:29 - 71:34)
in let&#39;s go where like when you&#39;re (71:32 - 71:36)
fighting Mewtwo or Zapdos or mtrace you (71:34 - 71:37)
have to like knock them out before you (71:36 - 71:39)
can actually catch them and I think that (71:37 - 71:40)
was like really smart and really clever (71:39 - 71:42)
instead of just like going in and (71:40 - 71:43)
putting Mewtwo to sleep and then (71:42 - 71:45)
chucking a million pokeballs but I think (71:43 - 71:48)
it it ends up being like the same result (71:45 - 71:50)
like with blood (71:48 - 71:54)
moon I fought blood moon and it knocked (71:50 - 71:55)
out like two Pokemon I didn&#39;t have like (71:54 - 71:57)
a team or anything for it but I could I (71:55 - 71:59)
could easily see somebody who has like a (71:57 - 72:02)
bunch of level 80s or a bunch of level (71:59 - 72:03)
70s that like oh this fight is like (72:02 - 72:05)
slightly tough it&#39;s at least like (72:03 - 72:08)
memorable in a way of oh cool I have to (72:05 - 72:10)
like fight this giant beast in the (72:08 - 72:12)
forest like there was a little Mission (72:10 - 72:13)
up to it I have to take some photos I (72:12 - 72:15)
have to follow parin I have to knock out (72:13 - 72:18)
this Pokemon like it felt rewarding of (72:15 - 72:20)
your time and then the cool thing is (72:18 - 72:21)
when you knock out blood moon you can (72:20 - 72:22)
just catch it in whatever you want heavy (72:21 - 72:24)
ball moonball dream ball Ultra Ball (72:22 - 72:26)
beastball (72:24 - 72:28)
and it feels like you accomplish (72:26 - 72:31)
something and the thing that&#39;s always (72:28 - 72:32)
bothered me and why I really do like (72:31 - 72:35)
let&#39;s go is with all the Legends I did (72:32 - 72:38)
the same thing I got up to them I FAL (72:35 - 72:39)
swiped them until they go where I&#39;m on (72:38 - 72:42)
HP I put them to sleep with Spore you (72:39 - 72:43)
could use hypnosis you could use sing (72:42 - 72:45)
it&#39;s the same thing I don&#39;t know why you (72:43 - 72:47)
just wouldn&#39;t use Spore uh you could (72:45 - 72:50)
Thunder Wave it which there&#39;s some (72:47 - 72:52)
convenience there because it can&#39;t shake (72:50 - 72:53)
off Thunder Wave but sleep is like (72:52 - 72:56)
significantly better than (72:53 - 72:59)
paralysis there&#39;s no move that freezes (72:56 - 73:00)
that does that doesn&#39;t do damage so you (72:59 - 73:02)
can&#39;t like freeze it because there&#39;s (73:00 - 73:05)
just all freezing moves do damage so (73:02 - 73:08)
that doesn&#39;t work uh you can&#39;t burn it (73:05 - 73:09)
because that doesn&#39;t work with false (73:08 - 73:11)
swipe you can&#39;t poison it that doesn&#39;t (73:09 - 73:14)
work with false swipe so really like my (73:11 - 73:16)
complaint (73:14 - 73:20)
is I had to do what like 20 some Legends (73:16 - 73:23)
and I had to do them all the same way (73:20 - 73:27)
which is false swipe SP and Chuck (73:23 - 73:30)
pokeballs lunala took Me 2 and a half (73:27 - 73:35)
hours mtrace took like three minutes I (73:30 - 73:36)
caught it on like the second (73:35 - 73:39)
one but (73:36 - 73:42)
like none of those were fun as like the (73:39 - 73:44)
blood moon fight the blood moon fight (73:42 - 73:47)
was so good so I think like in my head (73:44 - 73:48)
what would have been better is like if (73:47 - 73:51)
these Legends were out in the world sure (73:48 - 73:52)
they&#39;re going to be shiny locked because (73:51 - 73:53)
that&#39;s just how they did it but it would (73:52 - 73:56)
have been so cool if every Legend fight (73:53 - 74:00)
was like blood moon oh yeah like a Titan (73:56 - 74:04)
fight yeah yeah because like kalian (74:00 - 74:06)
verian and Tran could set up with sword (74:04 - 74:08)
dance and could be very threatening and (74:06 - 74:11)
if it if they had more HP than just the (74:08 - 74:14)
standard HP they could easily knock out (74:11 - 74:16)
like three or four Pokemon and it would (74:14 - 74:18)
be cool to be like I knocked out Teran (74:16 - 74:20)
and now I get to catch it in whatever (74:18 - 74:22)
Pokeball like that seems like a much (74:20 - 74:27)
more fun fight than what I had to do (74:22 - 74:30)
and I had to do it 20 (74:27 - 74:33)
times there wasn&#39;t a faster way now (74:30 - 74:36)
there now the sandwich does work after (74:33 - 74:39)
the 3.0 update sandwiches do work on the (74:36 - 74:43)
Legends so if you used urbam mystica you (74:39 - 74:46)
could make (74:43 - 74:51)
a uh flying type sandwich for hoo or a (74:46 - 74:52)
flying type sandwich for Lugia and it (74:51 - 74:54)
would increase the catch rate and that&#39;s (74:52 - 74:57)
nice of them to do to like okay there&#39;s (74:54 - 74:59)
other ways to increase the catch rate (74:57 - 75:00)
you can also increase the catch rate by (74:59 - 75:02)
backstabbing a Pokemon with like in (75:00 - 75:04)
Legends archus but you can&#39;t backstab (75:02 - 75:07)
the Legends my main complaint is there&#39;s (75:04 - 75:11)
800 plus moves in these in this series (75:07 - 75:14)
and only two matter for catching FAL (75:11 - 75:18)
swipe and Spore like it would (75:14 - 75:18)
be so cool if something like I used (75:18 - 75:24)
Misty terrain now Dragon type Pokemon (75:22 - 75:27)
are easier to catch or I used rain dance (75:24 - 75:29)
now fire type Pokemon are easier to (75:27 - 75:33)
catch or I used sweet scent and now it (75:29 - 75:35)
slightly increases the catch rate of (75:33 - 75:38)
grass type Pokemon like very simple (75:35 - 75:40)
things but it would at least make you go (75:38 - 75:44)
like oh I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m shiny hunting fantis (75:40 - 75:46)
or I&#39;m shiny hunting dragapult I&#39;m going (75:44 - 75:49)
to bring a slightly different team to C (75:46 - 75:52)
to cater to catching this and people (75:49 - 75:53)
will be like well just use a timer ball (75:52 - 75:55)
just use a quick ball just use a (75:53 - 75:58)
Pokeball no I am saying there are 800 (75:55 - 76:02)
moves and only two of them do something (75:58 - 76:03)
that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying like there should (76:02 - 76:06)
be other options to fit your play style (76:03 - 76:09)
that isn&#39;t like we&#39;re just going to use (76:06 - 76:11)
Bret Loom I mean and Brom is a cool (76:09 - 76:13)
Pokemon don&#39;t get me wrong that&#39;s one (76:11 - 76:15)
way to go about it I think I&#39;ve said (76:13 - 76:18)
before that I I would be satisfied if we (76:15 - 76:20)
just sort of took out the normal (76:18 - 76:24)
standard Pokemon battling from wild (76:20 - 76:27)
Pokemon for most if not all of them and (76:24 - 76:29)
then just left it either to to a (76:27 - 76:32)
combination of either just chucking a (76:29 - 76:34)
Pokeball like it was in (76:32 - 76:37)
Legends and seeing if you catch it there (76:34 - 76:40)
or battling it the way you do with all (76:37 - 76:41)
of the bigger battles in scarlet and (76:40 - 76:44)
violet and being able to get it down to (76:41 - 76:46)
zero HP and then choose what Pokeball to (76:44 - 76:49)
go to from there honestly I feel like (76:46 - 76:52)
those those are the two enjoyable ones (76:49 - 76:54)
yeah (76:52 - 76:57)
I we&#39;re coming up on the 30th (76:54 - 77:01)
anniversary of this series I cannot tell (76:57 - 77:05)
you how over I am on catch rates and one (77:01 - 77:07)
of I will tell you this one of the (77:05 - 77:08)
things that stops me from hunting The (77:07 - 77:12)
Legends in scarlet and violet is knowing (77:08 - 77:14)
the catch rate problem is knowing how (77:12 - 77:17)
much dumb preparation I have to do to (77:14 - 77:20)
sit there for an unknown amount of (77:17 - 77:24)
time when I know I if I don&#39;t get it I (77:20 - 77:27)
will soft reset it and catch it in the (77:24 - 77:29)
ball that I want and the only thing (77:27 - 77:33)
you&#39;re doing is wasting my time yeah yes (77:29 - 77:35)
it&#39;s just only thing that&#39;s happening (77:33 - 77:38)
there is is you are forcing me to spend (77:35 - 77:41)
an evening doing the same action over (77:38 - 77:44)
and over and over and over and over (77:41 - 77:48)
again for no good reason anymore just (77:44 - 77:51)
take that out let you play the game more (77:48 - 77:52)
I posted a Tik Tok about this and some (77:51 - 77:54)
of the comments were (77:52 - 77:56)
like uh uh some of the comments were (77:54 - 77:58)
like skill issue or that&#39;s just how the (77:56 - 78:02)
game is supposed to be or it&#39;s a j jrpg (77:58 - 78:04)
what do you expect it&#39;s not anymore it (78:02 - 78:06)
but it it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a skill (78:04 - 78:09)
issue to put something to sleep and to (78:06 - 78:11)
false swipe it it&#39;s not a skill issue to (78:09 - 78:14)
to Chuck pokeballs a skill issue would (78:11 - 78:17)
be like I couldn&#39;t beat blood moon or (78:14 - 78:20)
saluna because I brought the wrong (78:17 - 78:23)
Pokemon and it hit too hard there are (78:20 - 78:26)
Pokemon you can bring that are very good (78:23 - 78:28)
against blood moon or saluna and can (78:26 - 78:32)
wall blood moon or saluna very easily (78:28 - 78:34)
same thing for with like necros in older (78:32 - 78:38)
games same thing with um gym leaders (78:34 - 78:41)
like ah I&#39;m struggling against Yono well (78:38 - 78:43)
yeah you brought all water Pokemon what (78:41 - 78:46)
do you expect like I yeah but like the (78:43 - 78:49)
the that is (78:46 - 78:53)
a but I would rather prep I would rather (78:49 - 78:56)
lose to blood moon or like lose to (78:53 - 78:58)
something and be like oh I just have to (78:56 - 79:00)
switch my team up okay now I can do it (78:58 - 79:03)
next time instead of I&#39;m going to fall (79:00 - 79:05)
swipe this Cub Fu I&#39;m going to put it to (79:03 - 79:07)
sleep I&#39;m going to throw a bunch of (79:05 - 79:09)
pokeballs oh it struggled to death (79:07 - 79:11)
restart do it again like there&#39;s no (79:09 - 79:14)
skill there yeah the the difference (79:11 - 79:16)
between failing a (79:14 - 79:19)
raid is you can learn what to do better (79:16 - 79:23)
next time mhm then uh random generator (79:19 - 79:25)
number didn&#39;t hit this time because I (79:23 - 79:29)
did everything right it&#39;s at one HP and (79:25 - 79:32)
it is asleep yeah it has the highest (79:29 - 79:34)
chance and now I am just waiting for an (79:32 - 79:37)
internal algorithm to click to the (79:34 - 79:41)
correct number for it to capture there&#39;s (79:37 - 79:43)
nothing I can do different there&#39;s (79:41 - 79:45)
nothing I can improve on there&#39;s nothing (79:43 - 79:47)
I just have to suffer yeah for that&#39;s (79:45 - 79:50)
why I think that if more moves did (79:47 - 79:52)
something you could improve on it right (79:50 - 79:55)
like okay I&#39;m going to hunt (79:52 - 79:58)
I&#39;m going to hunt zero so I&#39;m going to (79:55 - 79:59)
I&#39;m going to bring my false swiper I&#39;m (79:58 - 80:00)
going to bring my sleeper I&#39;m going to (79:59 - 80:03)
bring my Misty terrain Center like the (80:00 - 80:06)
fact that two out of 800 moves actually (80:03 - 80:11)
matter doesn&#39;t every every uh catch is (80:06 - 80:12)
the same (80:11 - 80:14)
approach and I think you could improve (80:12 - 80:17)
on it but when we already have two other (80:14 - 80:20)
better catching mechanics I feel like we (80:17 - 80:24)
can just go with those honestly we have (80:20 - 80:26)
other reasons to use all the other moves (80:24 - 80:28)
in the games if you play competitive or (80:26 - 80:30)
if you want to use them in battles I (80:28 - 80:32)
think that those can stick to more (80:30 - 80:34)
battle specific things they can be used (80:32 - 80:37)
to get the HP down if it&#39;s more of a (80:34 - 80:40)
raid Style Match if you really want to (80:37 - 80:46)
use them um but otherwise I I I am done (80:40 - 80:47)
with the RNG and (80:46 - 80:50)
catching yep I think that&#39;s why I also (80:47 - 80:53)
liked let&#39;s go because let&#39;s go (80:50 - 80:56)
eliminated the false swipe sport right (80:53 - 80:58)
instead of doing false swipe and Spore (80:56 - 81:00)
you just used a golden raspberry it was (80:58 - 81:02)
ultimately the same thing you&#39;re just (81:00 - 81:03)
you&#39;re hitting one button instead of (81:02 - 81:05)
like three false swipes one four and (81:03 - 81:08)
then the other thing that I really (81:05 - 81:10)
appreciate about let&#39;s go is you could (81:08 - 81:13)
actually get better at it you could (81:10 - 81:15)
improve your Nies to greates you can (81:13 - 81:17)
improve your greates to excellent like (81:15 - 81:19)
you like they&#39;re still the RNG right (81:17 - 81:23)
there&#39;s still like this Zubat has a 11% (81:19 - 81:25)
chance of breaking out every time you (81:23 - 81:26)
throw and it&#39;s like okay well I&#39;ve (81:25 - 81:28)
caught enough zubats where now I&#39;m (81:26 - 81:31)
consistently hitting excellent yeah or (81:28 - 81:34)
what let&#39;s go also did is the more of a (81:31 - 81:38)
Pokemon you caught the easier it was to (81:34 - 81:41)
catch so it rewarded you both ways it (81:38 - 81:43)
rewarded your time for sitting there for (81:41 - 81:45)
an hour catching lick a Tong waiting for (81:43 - 81:47)
a shiny to show up but when the shiny (81:45 - 81:50)
did show up number one you&#39;ve caught (81:47 - 81:51)
ideally if you didn&#39;t stand there and do (81:50 - 81:53)
nothing but if you kept catching licky (81:51 - 81:55)
tongue licket tongues eventually when (81:53 - 81:57)
the shiny showed up it would be easier (81:55 - 81:59)
to catch because you caught more than (81:57 - 82:01)
enough and you caught so many of them (81:59 - 82:04)
that you should ideally be hitting (82:01 - 82:05)
excellent because you&#39;ve just gotten (82:04 - 82:08)
used to when to throw it so the game (82:05 - 82:13)
does two things really well uh it cut it (82:08 - 82:15)
gets rid of the like false swipe Spore (82:13 - 82:17)
just replaces it with a golden raspberry (82:15 - 82:20)
and then it actually gives you something (82:17 - 82:22)
to improve on as you&#39;re doing it there&#39;s (82:20 - 82:24)
nothing to improve on in scarlet and (82:22 - 82:26)
violet or sword and Shield it is I put (82:24 - 82:28)
it to sleep I fall swipe there&#39;s (82:26 - 82:31)
literally nothing I can do besides just (82:28 - 82:33)
wait at this point and there is no skill (82:31 - 82:37)
issue it&#39;s it&#39;s just I&#39;m going to catch (82:33 - 82:39)
it when the game decides it&#39;s okay to (82:37 - 82:41)
catch it (82:39 - 82:44)
yep do you prefer the let&#39;s go catching (82:41 - 82:46)
do you prefer the let&#39;s go catching to (82:44 - 82:48)
the Overworld Legends catching because I (82:46 - 82:51)
feel like those are similar but not the (82:48 - 82:56)
same I I like Legends catching more cuz (82:51 - 82:59)
I think cuz it&#39;s more Dynamic but I can (82:56 - 83:00)
see why people don&#39;t like it cuz it is (82:59 - 83:03)
very action based and if you are I think (83:00 - 83:05)
a lot of people come to Pokemon because (83:03 - 83:07)
it is turn-based and they can move at (83:05 - 83:10)
their own speed and I I I think that&#39;s (83:07 - 83:13)
totally valid and totally like a pre a (83:10 - 83:15)
preference that like why you came to the (83:13 - 83:17)
series to begin with yeah but the great (83:15 - 83:20)
thing about Legends is you could do the (83:17 - 83:22)
I&#39;m going to roll behind you I&#39;m going (83:20 - 83:23)
to hit you with a sticky glob I&#39;m going (83:22 - 83:24)
to hit you in the back of the head with (83:23 - 83:25)
a heavy ball and I&#39;m going to catch you (83:24 - 83:27)
and I&#39;m going to keep on running and (83:25 - 83:29)
that&#39;s great and fantastic but the cool (83:27 - 83:30)
thing about Legends is I could just walk (83:29 - 83:32)
into the Pokemon start a battle and (83:30 - 83:34)
catch it the traditional way yeah and (83:32 - 83:35)
that was fantastic that it had both (83:34 - 83:38)
options yeah I mean I&#39;m at this point (83:35 - 83:42)
just give me Titans and raids I I I just (83:38 - 83:45)
I want to do the battle like I the (83:42 - 83:47)
battle&#39;s fun the battles can be super (83:45 - 83:49)
fun they can be interesting puzzles and (83:47 - 83:51)
then I just want the reward and move on (83:49 - 83:55)
with my life I don&#39;t want (83:51 - 83:58)
to fail to fail it because there&#39;s no (83:55 - 84:00)
real failing because this you&#39;ve saved (83:58 - 84:02)
it and you soft reset I don&#39;t want to (84:00 - 84:04)
waste my (84:02 - 84:08)
time to do to do the (84:04 - 84:11)
inevitable to to to do the thing that (84:08 - 84:12)
will (84:11 - 84:16)
happen I just have to put time into it (84:12 - 84:17)
which is (84:16 - 84:24)
just does not treat me well as a uh as a (84:17 - 84:27)
consumer and a customer of your product (84:24 - 84:29)
you are not acknowledging or treating my (84:27 - 84:33)
time particularly well it&#39;s like I (84:29 - 84:35)
always look at this like I can do a ton (84:33 - 84:37)
of I will do a ton of raids in scarlet (84:35 - 84:39)
and violet and I will also run the same (84:37 - 84:41)
dungeon over and over and over and over (84:39 - 84:44)
again in Final Fantasy because I know (84:41 - 84:48)
what the set rewards are I know what I&#39;m (84:44 - 84:50)
getting I know I will get something that (84:48 - 84:54)
I need from these things I know that I (84:50 - 84:57)
that I have a 10-minute time this (84:54 - 84:59)
dungeon takes 10 minutes at the end I (84:57 - 85:01)
get my reward this raid will take five (84:59 - 85:04)
minutes at the end I get reward that is (85:01 - 85:06)
just I know what I&#39;m doing when I&#39;m (85:04 - 85:09)
hunting Legends it&#39;s I will find them (85:06 - 85:12)
and then I could spend the next seven (85:09 - 85:16)
days trying to get this because (85:12 - 85:18)
RNG exists and (85:16 - 85:21)
also I&#39;m running through an unknown (85:18 - 85:23)
amount of balls like at what point do I (85:21 - 85:25)
say well I&#39;ve put 30 luxury balls in (85:23 - 85:27)
here that&#39;s so much money I have to (85:25 - 85:29)
remake in this game I&#39;m just going to (85:27 - 85:32)
restart because I&#39;m just as likely to (85:29 - 85:36)
get it on the second ball as I am on the (85:32 - 85:38)
90th and I might as well if I don&#39;t (85:36 - 85:40)
catch it the first time just soft reset (85:38 - 85:42)
until the numbers match up and that&#39;s (85:40 - 85:44)
also a terrible (85:42 - 85:46)
experience yeah (85:44 - 85:48)
I I think Pokemon is still one of the (85:46 - 85:51)
only franchises where it&#39;s like I got to (85:48 - 85:55)
turn it off and turn back yep (85:51 - 85:57)
yeah (85:55 - 86:02)
gosh um anyways I if you need something (85:57 - 86:03)
to (86:02 - 86:09)
do don&#39;t do that I do think I do think (86:03 - 86:11)
reading what (86:09 - 86:11)
pretty bad oh (86:24 - 86:31)
no oh such a bad mistake to make when (86:27 - 86:33)
you get there and you&#39;re in the snow and (86:31 - 86:36)
you&#39;re looking for a white horse in the (86:33 - 86:37)
snow (86:36 - 86:40)
no and you&#39;re like he says it&#39;s here and (86:37 - 86:41)
it&#39;s (86:40 - 86:45)
not uh maybe just walk around a lot in (86:41 - 86:47)
that area uh I had to look that one up (86:45 - 86:51)
because I was like it&#39;s not here oh uh (86:47 - 86:53)
the draw distance just isn&#39;t good I (86:51 - 86:56)
needed to Walk This Way got it (86:53 - 87:00)
um yeah uh I think I I do I do (86:56 - 87:02)
appreciate scarlet and violet more (87:00 - 87:06)
because I had to go back (87:02 - 87:09)
to not having everything unlocked and (87:06 - 87:12)
the DLC just like in sword and shield (87:09 - 87:14)
the DLC really elevated those games and (87:12 - 87:17)
when you go back to base game and (87:14 - 87:18)
everything is taken away from you you&#39;re (87:17 - 87:19)
like (87:18 - 87:22)
oh h i I missed (87:19 - 87:24)
that and just like in sword and shield (87:22 - 87:27)
you can see in scarlet and violet where (87:24 - 87:29)
they are improving things yeah yeah in (87:27 - 87:33)
the DLC and it&#39;s exciting people are so (87:29 - 87:35)
excited that the game boy version of (87:33 - 87:39)
Mystery Dungeon is on the switch and I (87:35 - 87:41)
tried to play Yellow when it came back (87:39 - 87:44)
and I&#39;m like going this far back in (87:41 - 87:47)
quality of life is so (87:44 - 87:51)
miserable no I cannot do this again yeah (87:47 - 87:54)
that&#39;s why it&#39;s like that what a weird G (87:51 - 87:55)
what out of all the Mystery Dungeons (87:54 - 87:57)
what a weird one to put on because you (87:55 - 88:00)
put the one you remade on the switch (87:57 - 88:04)
Yeah it&#39;s I don&#39;t like it&#39;s not even the (88:00 - 88:06)
most popular one like everybody knows (88:04 - 88:10)
the one that everybody wants to play (88:06 - 88:13)
yeah all right uh last bit of news is (88:10 - 88:15)
they finally announced the community day (88:13 - 88:19)
for this upcoming week uh which is (88:15 - 88:21)
Beldum uh which is a bummer it wasn&#39;t (88:19 - 88:24)
like a Pokemon that could gigantamax or (88:21 - 88:26)
Dynamax sorry gigantamax that would have (88:24 - 88:27)
been (88:26 - 88:31)
like Gastly Squirtle well all the (88:27 - 88:33)
starters but (88:31 - 88:36)
Gastly couple other ones um because we (88:33 - 88:39)
know that gigantamax and Galler stuff is (88:36 - 88:41)
in the (88:39 - 88:43)
game yep code at this point just because (88:41 - 88:45)
I mean it&#39;s more than in the code it&#39;s (88:43 - 88:49)
in the decks yeah literally have to be a (88:45 - 88:50)
data Miner to open up your decks and you (88:49 - 88:52)
can see that there&#39;s a button for (88:50 - 88:55)
dynamatic now so uh (88:52 - 88:57)
we were unsure if they were holding out (88:55 - 88:59)
on community day because maybe it was (88:57 - 89:01)
going to lean into a Pokemon that could (88:59 - 89:03)
gigantamax like Gastly uh because I (89:01 - 89:04)
think gigantamax Gengar would actually (89:03 - 89:08)
be a really great start to that uh that (89:04 - 89:10)
being said for whatever reason they just (89:08 - 89:12)
waited last minute to say Beldum Beldum (89:10 - 89:14)
very popular Pokemon Metagross very (89:12 - 89:15)

level you also get the adree episodes (93:12 - 93:17)
the bonus episodes all that stuff I also (93:15 - 93:21)
posted uh I took a film camera to Japan (93:17 - 93:23)
and I took pictures of the Pikachu train (93:21 - 93:24)
with a film camera it was the first time (93:23 - 93:26)
I&#39;ve ever used a film camera so they&#39;re (93:24 - 93:28)
not like amazing photos it was like (93:26 - 93:29)
something I was trying to teach myself (93:28 - 93:31)
while I was there but if you want to but (93:29 - 93:34)
it makes the Pikachu train look more (93:31 - 93:37)
creepy because because it&#39;s a film (93:34 - 93:39)
camera and it looks like it was taken in (93:37 - 93:40)
like (93:39 - 93:42)
1980 uh so if you want to see that (93:40 - 93:45)
that&#39;s quit attacking (93:42 - 93:49)
me so if you want to see that uh I only (93:45 - 93:50)
lost one roll of (93:49 - 93:52)
film while I was there that was pretty (93:50 - 93:54)
good that&#39;s pretty good did you do (93:52 - 93:57)
the the classic uh this is a new thing (93:54 - 93:59)
of film and it&#39;s actually a thing you (93:57 - 94:01)
already took photos over so you double (93:59 - 94:03)
exposed it which my aunt did for an (94:01 - 94:05)
entire trip to Paris oh no that sounds (94:03 - 94:07)
awesome no actually those pict the (94:05 - 94:08)
pictures are great though because you&#39;re (94:07 - 94:10)
like why is Lisa in the middle of the (94:08 - 94:13)
Sun but also it&#39;s not great if you&#39;re (94:10 - 94:16)
trying to remember anything that sounds (94:13 - 94:19)
awesome no I the first film I bought (94:16 - 94:21)
which was here in Minneapolis was like (94:19 - 94:22)
36 (94:21 - 94:25)
shots and when I got to Japan I was like (94:22 - 94:28)
oh I I didn&#39;t want to like bring a bunch (94:25 - 94:29)
of film just in case it got like damaged (94:28 - 94:31)
from the scanners I was like I&#39;ll just (94:29 - 94:33)
buy film when I get to Japan so I bought (94:31 - 94:36)
film when I got there and I didn&#39;t look (94:33 - 94:37)
at it because it was this it was both (94:36 - 94:40)
Kodak but their film was only 24 Shots (94:37 - 94:43)
yeah so when I got to the 24th shot I (94:40 - 94:44)
thought it (94:43 - 94:47)
jammed and I was like and I didn&#39;t (94:44 - 94:48)
realize it until I put the new roll in (94:47 - 94:50)
that I was like oh these are less shots (94:48 - 94:52)
so it was at the end of the line and I (94:50 - 94:53)
was like oh it&#39;s jamming and I was like (94:52 - 94:55)
ah where I read if it jams you&#39;re kind (94:53 - 95:01)
of screwed and I was like okay I I need (94:55 - 95:02)
to switch out film because we&#39;re getting (95:01 - 95:03)
onto the Pikachu train so I was like (95:02 - 95:05)
we&#39;re going to lose everything and I (95:03 - 95:06)
like tried to save it and then when I (95:05 - 95:08)
was putting the new film in I was like (95:06 - 95:10)
oh it wasn&#39;t actually jammed it was just (95:08 - 95:13)
done and I didn&#39;t roll it but I didn&#39;t (95:10 - 95:15)
realize that was I thought they were all (95:13 - 95:17)
just 36 cu the first one was 36 but the (95:15 - 95:20)
second that&#39;s that&#39;s the old scam that (95:17 - 95:22)
we used to get us with the varying (95:20 - 95:26)
amount of shots on film (95:22 - 95:26)
so I thought it was pretty good though I (95:26 - 95:29)
took three rolls I only lost one for my (95:27 - 95:31)
first time shooting (95:29 - 95:33)
CU but if you want to see that that&#39;s on (95:31 - 95:35)
