[Music] (0:02 - 0:27)
oh (0:26 - 0:30)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:27 - 0:33)
498th episode of the pokemon podcast (0:30 - 0:37)
it's super effective i'm your host sbj (0:33 - 0:40)
and with me today is will i wish i could (0:37 - 0:43)
do a yaakov smirnoff accent but i can't (0:40 - 0:45)
so all i can say is (0:43 - 0:46)
uh (0:45 - 0:49)
greg knows what's coming (0:46 - 0:49)
in unova you catch monster in tall grass (0:50 - 0:59)
in kusui monster in tall grass is you (0:53 - 0:59)
oh let's go back to the 80s kids (1:02 - 1:06)
it's not enough sleep (1:06 - 1:11)
in mother's day (1:08 - 1:11)
let's talk about this bad game come on (1:13 - 1:16)
oh god (1:15 - 1:19)
oh my gosh (1:16 - 1:22)
you know before we record these episodes (1:19 - 1:23)
we don't actually talk about our (1:22 - 1:25)
feelings so i don't actually know how (1:23 - 1:27)
greg and will feel about this game hey (1:25 - 1:30)
here's what's going to happen uh we did (1:27 - 1:32)
not do a mini series for this game (1:30 - 1:34)
mostly because we did not know how this (1:32 - 1:35)
game was going to be laid out (1:34 - 1:36)
uh (1:35 - 1:40)
and there will be a bonus episode or two (1:36 - 1:42)
later this week with some thoughts and (1:40 - 1:43)
feelings (1:42 - 1:44)
still not a hundred percent sure what (1:43 - 1:46)
this is going to look like we're (1:44 - 1:47)
we're recording this at a normal sunday (1:46 - 1:48)
morning (1:47 - 1:51)
um i'm still doing a marathon on twitch (1:48 - 1:52)
as we're recording this (1:51 - 1:55)
and then uh (1:52 - 1:57)
we'll go from there so (1:55 - 2:00)
for this episode if you're listening if (1:57 - 2:02)
you tuned in right now before and you're (2:00 - 2:03)
like i don't know if i should keep (2:02 - 2:07)
listening uh we're gonna only talk up to (2:03 - 2:09)
cleaver because i think there's more (2:07 - 2:11)
than enough to talk about (2:09 - 2:12)
good because that's as far as i've (2:11 - 2:15)
gotten (2:12 - 2:15)
um so that's you know all story is on (2:17 - 2:23)
the table up to cleaver uh all mechanics (2:20 - 2:25)
on the table up to cleaver all pokemon (2:23 - 2:27)
on the table up to cleaver (2:25 - 2:28)
uh (2:27 - 2:31)
you know they do the thing where (2:28 - 2:33)
they show a bunch of new pokemon in (2:31 - 2:34)
previews and then you don't get any of (2:33 - 2:36)
them until (2:34 - 2:38)
very far into the game (2:36 - 2:41)
it's fine it's fine (2:38 - 2:44)
it's okay i guess (2:41 - 2:46)
um look i have what i need out of the (2:44 - 2:48)
game right now so (2:46 - 2:52)
so uh i guess like (2:48 - 2:52)
uh well we'll try to have somewhat of a (2:52 - 2:56)
structure for this episode i would (2:54 - 2:57)
probably call this episode like a first (2:56 - 2:58)
impressions (2:57 - 3:01)
uh i have played (2:58 - 3:04)
the game for about 20 hours over the (3:01 - 3:05)
last (3:04 - 3:10)
uh 50 some hours it's been out (3:05 - 3:12)
i don't know what's 24 plus times three (3:10 - 3:15)
it's been out for like 36 36 30 wait no (3:12 - 3:19)
24 times 3 is 72 i'm sorry 72 yeah 72. (3:15 - 3:21)
but you haven't done the third yet (3:19 - 3:23)
yeah that's true as of this recording (3:21 - 3:26)
i'll have another 12 hours (3:23 - 3:26)
yeah (3:27 - 3:30)
so as of right now i've gotten about 20 (3:28 - 3:31)
hours in (3:30 - 3:34)
uh i am only at the (3:31 - 3:36)
so i i guess it's not a spoiler in the (3:34 - 3:38)
sense of if you look at your trainer (3:36 - 3:41)
card there are five spots for badges aka (3:38 - 3:43)
that's where nobles go and you figure (3:41 - 3:46)
that out when you beat cleaver yeah so (3:43 - 3:49)
there are four more nobles after cleaver (3:46 - 3:51)
unless the trainer card magically (3:49 - 3:52)
updates (3:51 - 3:54)
um (3:52 - 3:54)
i can't even get it to update my picture (3:55 - 3:59)
so probably not yeah (3:56 - 4:01)
yeah (3:59 - 4:03)
uh so as of this recording i have beat (4:01 - 4:05)
the second noble which i will not spoil (4:03 - 4:06)
oh (4:05 - 4:08)
you're behind me buddy uh i've been (4:06 - 4:10)
doing pretty much like one noble a day (4:08 - 4:12)
because it (4:10 - 4:15)
gives me an entire 12 hours to explore (4:12 - 4:18)
one area so as of today i'll be starting (4:15 - 4:20)
that third area (4:18 - 4:23)
five nobles equals five areas uh there's (4:20 - 4:25)
a lot to this game (4:23 - 4:27)
uh i have (4:25 - 4:29)
a lot of positive thoughts i have a (4:27 - 4:32)
couple negative thoughts i i guess we'll (4:29 - 4:33)
start with (4:32 - 4:34)
uh (4:33 - 4:36)
game freak listen to you greg they you (4:34 - 4:37)
know they're always listening to the (4:36 - 4:39)
show they're like (4:37 - 4:41)
these these three (4:39 - 4:42)
handsome (4:41 - 4:45)
very pretty hosts they're they're very (4:42 - 4:48)
concerned about why (4:45 - 4:48)
we have a cell phone in the past (4:48 - 4:54)
oh i didn't take it as game freak (4:53 - 4:56)
listening to greg i took it as great (4:54 - 4:58)
game freaks saying to greg (4:56 - 5:00)
words that i cannot pronounce on this (4:58 - 5:02)
program (5:00 - 5:03)
look (5:02 - 5:04)
all right (5:03 - 5:07)
as a jrpg fan (5:04 - 5:10)
light long lifelong fan of jrpgs (5:07 - 5:13)
i appreciate that within the first three (5:10 - 5:15)
minutes of this game they said (5:13 - 5:17)
let's take the (5:15 - 5:21)
jrpg nonsense dial and turn it up to 11. (5:17 - 5:23)
we are just going straight nonsense and (5:21 - 5:26)
i am here (5:23 - 5:28)
for it yes within the first (5:26 - 5:30)
few minutes (5:28 - 5:32)
of that game i'm like yep sold but also (5:30 - 5:34)
it's it's nonsense (5:32 - 5:36)
but i'm i'm living for the nonsense but (5:34 - 5:38)
the way they did it though too like i (5:36 - 5:39)
don't know if you guys have thought (5:38 - 5:42)
about it this way but it's like (5:39 - 5:43)
everybody (5:42 - 5:44)
i'm not gonna get into the (5:43 - 5:46)
ridiculousness of why would i move to a (5:44 - 5:48)
place where i'm scared of everything but (5:46 - 5:51)
everybody there is like we don't we (5:48 - 5:52)
don't know the whole pokemon biz and (5:51 - 5:54)
then you show up and you're like i know (5:52 - 5:56)
the pokemon i know there's a big why do (5:54 - 6:00)
you know the pokemon biz oh because (5:56 - 6:02)
you've been transported from a different (6:00 - 6:04)
world where pokemon biz is a little more (6:02 - 6:06)
uncomfortable (6:04 - 6:10)
i will say being further along the game (6:06 - 6:10)
yeah i am they just turned the nonsense (6:11 - 6:15)
up to 11. (6:13 - 6:17)
[Laughter] (6:15 - 6:21)
there's so much i (6:17 - 6:21)
heard me scream (6:24 - 6:27)
what is going on (6:28 - 6:33)
why (6:31 - 6:35)
what (6:33 - 6:36)
multiple times (6:35 - 6:39)
i i do think (6:36 - 6:39)
that (6:39 - 6:42)
we're we are getting to a point and i (6:39 - 6:44)
i would say for me the turning point was (6:42 - 6:46)
pokemon masters (6:44 - 6:50)
where it feels a little weird we have no (6:46 - 6:52)
voice acting (6:50 - 6:54)
yeah i (6:52 - 6:55)
i don't (6:54 - 6:58)
necessarily think i i remember there's a (6:55 - 6:59)
huge debate in the destiny community (6:58 - 7:01)
about how your main character never (6:59 - 7:03)
talks and they like made in the maiden (7:01 - 7:05)
character talk and i was like but why (7:03 - 7:06)
like (7:05 - 7:08)
i don't think he needs to (7:06 - 7:10)
and i still don't think the main (7:08 - 7:11)
character needs to talk because i'm the (7:10 - 7:13)
main character and i don't think our (7:11 - 7:15)
main character needs to talk (7:13 - 7:17)
but at least in that opening scene where (7:15 - 7:19)
arceus is (7:17 - 7:20)
i don't know maybe he likes shakespeare (7:19 - 7:23)
or something and he's talking very like (7:20 - 7:25)
the art thou shall well because that's (7:23 - 7:27)
like (7:25 - 7:29)
that (7:27 - 7:32)
big fees from my cell phone like he is (7:29 - 7:34)
literally a t in this game (7:32 - 7:36)
hey (7:34 - 7:38)
i mean i watch it he's more of a verizon (7:36 - 7:39)
but (7:38 - 7:41)
sure (7:39 - 7:43)
but that definitely not t-mobile they're (7:41 - 7:44)
bad i think that scene probably would (7:43 - 7:48)
have benefited the most from some voice (7:44 - 7:51)
of some sort (7:48 - 7:52)
i mean they made him talk i think maybe (7:51 - 7:54)
because they made him talk i i think (7:52 - 7:58)
that's a losing (7:54 - 7:58)
situate like 99 percent of the voice (7:58 - 8:04)
actors they get are are a bad choice (8:01 - 8:06)
like didn't there be voice acting in (8:04 - 8:09)
fire emblem wasn't that like really (8:06 - 8:12)
yeah but (8:09 - 8:12)
you're saying voice for a pokemon voice (8:12 - 8:18)
for a pokemon and in particular (8:14 - 8:20)
given how (8:18 - 8:23)
not great it is in the movies (8:20 - 8:25)
that is more fraught i think with danger (8:23 - 8:28)
in the games than just not having it (8:25 - 8:29)
i (8:28 - 8:30)
it (8:29 - 8:33)
it enhances the experience maybe two (8:30 - 8:35)
percent (8:33 - 8:37)
yeah that well that's my thing too (8:35 - 8:39)
that's not worth it i mean but we know (8:37 - 8:40)
that the real problem is that you don't (8:39 - 8:42)
want to read any of the dialogue boxes (8:40 - 8:44)
and you just want them to read to you (8:42 - 8:45)
yeah (8:44 - 8:46)
um (8:45 - 8:48)
turn on text to speech (8:46 - 8:50)
i i (8:48 - 8:52)
i think the thing i do i would want is (8:50 - 8:53)
the thing they do in masters where (8:52 - 8:57)
they're like hi hey okay let's like i (8:53 - 8:59)
think that would actually (8:57 - 9:01)
be a good compromise instead of full (8:59 - 9:03)
voice acting at this point turn that off (9:01 - 9:05)
in masters because it gets real annoying (9:03 - 9:08)
real quick oh i really like it masters (9:05 - 9:12)
because the 14th time somebody said hey (9:08 - 9:12)
wow (9:13 - 9:17)
cool oh (9:15 - 9:20)
shut up not a big ocarina of time fan (9:17 - 9:21)
are you (9:20 - 9:22)
hey listen (9:21 - 9:24)
uh-huh (9:22 - 9:27)
well (9:24 - 9:27)
no quiet off (9:29 - 9:35)
phone sound off shush (9:31 - 9:38)
if you're not going to speak to me (9:35 - 9:39)
don't (9:38 - 9:40)
if if all that comes out of you is a (9:39 - 9:43)
single word or (9:40 - 9:45)
i'm out (9:43 - 9:47)
i (9:45 - 9:47)
feel like there's a lot of dialogue in (9:48 - 9:52)
this game am i wrong on that or do there (9:50 - 9:54)
is a lot of dialogue in this game it's a (9:52 - 9:56)
story driven game yep i wouldn't say (9:54 - 9:58)
there's more dialogue than any other (9:56 - 10:00)
pokemon game (9:58 - 10:02)
oh i would say (10:00 - 10:03)
there there's more dialogue because (10:02 - 10:06)
there's a lot of side quests and the (10:03 - 10:09)
side quests have a lot of story to them (10:06 - 10:11)
so (10:09 - 10:11)
i mean like the the lady that's like let (10:12 - 10:16)
me see (10:15 - 10:19)
all the roselia like you're you just (10:16 - 10:20)
like hey hey hey hey that's not before (10:19 - 10:21)
cleaver (10:20 - 10:24)
okay there's a person that wants all uh (10:21 - 10:25)
i can't think there's another person (10:24 - 10:26)
that wants all of us something (10:25 - 10:29)
there's a breeze that's all of cricket (10:26 - 10:30)
cricket too and qriket tune like they (10:29 - 10:32)
don't say much they're like i want all (10:30 - 10:33)
the full pokedex of cricket tune and (10:32 - 10:35)
then they come back they're like they (10:33 - 10:37)
like read the qriketoon pokedex entry (10:35 - 10:39)
which is whatever and then they're like (10:37 - 10:40)
well and then they run away and they (10:39 - 10:43)
just vanish i mean they have a bunch of (10:40 - 10:45)
dialogue reading that (10:43 - 10:47)
entry like they all have a lot of (10:45 - 10:48)
dialogue (10:47 - 10:50)
i don't think any of it's unnecessary (10:48 - 10:52)
but (10:50 - 10:52)
as the side quests get more complicated (10:53 - 10:58)
you get more dialogue and you get more (10:56 - 11:01)
story because they're filling in (10:58 - 11:03)
blanks and i very much appreciate it and (11:01 - 11:05)
it proves to me that (11:03 - 11:09)
pokemon could easily be an mmo (11:05 - 11:10)
well we already have an mmo it's called (11:09 - 11:13)
pokemon go they they create a (11:10 - 11:15)
well-rounded (11:13 - 11:16)
it's not an mm-hmm (11:15 - 11:19)
massive multiplayer online gameplay i'm (11:16 - 11:21)
not getting into this argument we're (11:19 - 11:23)
talking about legends arceus (11:21 - 11:24)
um (11:23 - 11:26)
yeah no i mean but like having that (11:24 - 11:28)
dialogue is what what creates your (11:26 - 11:30)
understanding of the world that you're (11:28 - 11:33)
in and the characters like (11:30 - 11:35)
uh (11:33 - 11:37)
i was gonna say like positive with (11:35 - 11:40)
negative i love the fact that so many (11:37 - 11:43)
people in the town have names yeah but (11:40 - 11:44)
then (11:43 - 11:46)
sometimes you go places and they don't (11:44 - 11:48)
have names (11:46 - 11:50)
and i'm like you ran you didn't get that (11:48 - 11:51)
baby names book that you couldn't have (11:50 - 11:54)
given a few more people names there are (11:51 - 11:55)
times where they run out of names it's (11:54 - 11:58)
like galaxy team member really that guy (11:55 - 12:01)
couldn't have a name yeah well (11:58 - 12:03)
but i do everybody needs a red shirt i i (12:01 - 12:05)
appreciate that they that they gave (12:03 - 12:06)
people names (12:05 - 12:08)
and it's not just like supply corps (12:06 - 12:11)
member or or you know garden gardener (12:08 - 12:13)
guy (12:11 - 12:13)
the (12:16 - 12:18)
game is in my opinion pretty much (12:19 - 12:24)
tutorial mode until cleaver (12:21 - 12:27)
like they they continue to (12:24 - 12:27)
they continue to they continue to like (12:28 - 12:32)
hold your hand (12:30 - 12:34)
for things like at a certain point sure (12:32 - 12:36)
you can like run anywhere you want (12:34 - 12:38)
but they're still teaching you things up (12:36 - 12:41)
to cleaver even after cleaver they're (12:38 - 12:43)
they they're like here's what (12:41 - 12:45)
distortions are and it's like oh i've (12:43 - 12:47)
done distortions already but like the (12:45 - 12:48)
tutorial for distortion is like come (12:47 - 12:51)
across any distortions (12:48 - 12:55)
oh i've seen many spoilers (12:51 - 12:55)
i don't think it's a spoiler because you (12:55 - 12:59)
can get distortions before cleaver i (12:57 - 13:00)
don't know you if you have to do (12:59 - 13:02)
anything specifically like i don't know (13:00 - 13:04)
if you need to be ranked two or they (13:02 - 13:08)
they happen according to star rank (13:04 - 13:10)
according to what (13:08 - 13:11)
your stars (13:10 - 13:13)
oh is it a certain star level i've got (13:11 - 13:15)
yeah it's a certain star level i think (13:13 - 13:16)
i'm (13:15 - 13:19)
three stars two i'm either two or three (13:16 - 13:21)
stars at this point well you'd have to (13:19 - 13:23)
be giving them soon (13:21 - 13:26)
yeah like three (13:23 - 13:28)
well like like i i've talked to people (13:26 - 13:29)
who said they've beaten the game and (13:28 - 13:32)
they're they're about five or six stars (13:29 - 13:35)
i am i am seven stars out of ten (13:32 - 13:38)
and i am at the second because i i'm (13:35 - 13:40)
just like if i see a new pokemon i'm (13:38 - 13:42)
catching it i'm at five that's that's (13:40 - 13:45)
okay number one i agree with you that it (13:42 - 13:46)
is (13:45 - 13:48)
it is tutorial but light tutorial (13:46 - 13:51)
it's a very light tutorial um because at (13:48 - 13:53)
any point you can wander off and it's (13:51 - 13:56)
like i'm out here to catch (13:53 - 13:58)
and attack a thousand badoof and i'm (13:56 - 14:00)
gonna spend all day and you can you can (13:58 - 14:02)
do it there's no time to go enjoy (14:00 - 14:05)
yourself and i did that (14:02 - 14:05)
like there are far too many badoo in (14:07 - 14:11)
this world (14:09 - 14:11)
depends on how willing you are to plow (14:12 - 14:17)
through to the first (14:15 - 14:20)
noble yeah if you're just gonna plow (14:17 - 14:22)
through and just be like we're gonna hit (14:20 - 14:24)
these things i'm gonna do no side quests (14:22 - 14:26)
i am not gonna leave the the branching (14:24 - 14:29)
path i'm gonna stay on the one road that (14:26 - 14:32)
leads me straight to it it is not long (14:29 - 14:32)
at all (14:32 - 14:34)
right yeah like you could probably get (14:32 - 14:37)
to cleaver incredibly quickly (14:34 - 14:39)
or like me it took me 10 hours to get to (14:37 - 14:40)
cleaver (14:39 - 14:43)
my feelings of (14:40 - 14:45)
getting into that first area i don't (14:43 - 14:46)
even know what it's called (14:45 - 14:49)
the first wild area obsidian fields (14:46 - 14:51)
is the same feeling i had when i got to (14:49 - 14:54)
the wild area in sword and shield (14:51 - 14:57)
it's just like i can i want to explore (14:54 - 14:59)
all of this because over here is (14:57 - 15:02)
different than overhead there (14:59 - 15:03)
and (15:02 - 15:06)
i don't need to get to the first gym i'm (15:03 - 15:08)
i'm good with what i'm good where what (15:06 - 15:09)
is this pink laser what is this red (15:08 - 15:11)
laser (15:09 - 15:12)
what is the sandstorm (15:11 - 15:14)
like it was it was very much that same (15:12 - 15:15)
feeling (15:14 - 15:17)
but i could see the opposite where (15:15 - 15:18)
people are like oh i don't wanna i don't (15:17 - 15:20)
wanna explore this right now i just (15:18 - 15:21)
wanna get to the first (15:20 - 15:24)
yeah i kind of feel the same way i was (15:21 - 15:26)
like oh i wanna run around i want to see (15:24 - 15:28)
everything and then i i had two (15:26 - 15:30)
realizations one i was like this is too (15:28 - 15:31)
big (15:30 - 15:33)
and i will (15:31 - 15:34)
everyone's gonna complain i'm going way (15:33 - 15:36)
too slow because i will explore every (15:34 - 15:38)
nook and cranny and never get anywhere (15:36 - 15:42)
and number two i stumbled across a level (15:38 - 15:46)
40 alpha level 40 alpha lexio and it (15:42 - 15:47)
made me cry (15:46 - 15:50)
yeah i was like what are you doing (15:47 - 15:54)
what are you doing buddy (15:50 - 15:54)
i was like no no no i've got to make (15:54 - 15:58)
some more progress so this never happens (15:56 - 16:00)
again (15:58 - 16:00)
uh to back it up a little bit the the (16:03 - 16:08)
opening like tutorial is catch these (16:06 - 16:10)
three starter pokemon (16:08 - 16:12)
does a really good job at like (16:10 - 16:14)
walk around this mini very mini wild (16:12 - 16:17)
very mini and then catch these three (16:14 - 16:18)
pokemon (16:17 - 16:20)
and then they're they're i do like how (16:18 - 16:21)
the characters (16:20 - 16:24)
are confused just as you are and if (16:21 - 16:26)
you're the girl character you have like (16:24 - 16:28)
the alola shirt on (16:26 - 16:32)
it's the luck luxe luxury ball alola (16:28 - 16:33)
shirt that you actually can buy and wear (16:32 - 16:34)
in sun and moon (16:33 - 16:36)
and then i think the the boy is wearing (16:34 - 16:38)
a shirt from x and y that you can buy in (16:36 - 16:40)
the yeah (16:38 - 16:40)
yeah (16:40 - 16:42)
so it's like really cool that they drop (16:40 - 16:44)
it down (16:42 - 16:45)
out of the sky (16:44 - 16:47)
you can see their cell phone like flying (16:45 - 16:49)
next to them they pick it up it turns (16:47 - 16:51)
into the arc phone (16:49 - 16:52)
which (16:51 - 16:53)
why (16:52 - 16:54)
look (16:53 - 16:58)
arkey just use my phone as it is (16:54 - 16:59)
they are gonna they don't know what an (16:58 - 17:01)
arc phone is much less what a cell phone (16:59 - 17:03)
is you didn't need to jank up my (17:01 - 17:05)
thirteen (17:03 - 17:07)
hundred dollar phone (17:05 - 17:09)
your virus i know you you're not as (17:07 - 17:12)
churchy as say someone like me has been (17:09 - 17:15)
but look at (17:12 - 17:15)
any time (17:15 - 17:22)
the religions they gotta fancify it (17:17 - 17:24)
did you did you guys notice that like (17:22 - 17:26)
he tells you the end of the game right (17:24 - 17:28)
away right (17:26 - 17:30)
he goes yeah if you want to find me you (17:28 - 17:32)
need to complete the pokemon yes (17:30 - 17:34)
yeah yeah i don't think i would count (17:32 - 17:36)
that as the end of the game that i would (17:34 - 17:37)
say that as an (17:36 - 17:41)
end of the game an end well yeah yeah (17:37 - 17:43)
it tells you the end goal (17:41 - 17:45)
right like it says the point of this (17:43 - 17:47)
game is to do this (17:45 - 17:49)
right yeah the marketing is complete (17:47 - 17:53)
jesus very first pokedex and his opening (17:49 - 17:55)
shakespeare is (17:53 - 17:58)
if art thou shall find me if thou shalt (17:55 - 18:01)
get one of every pokemon (17:58 - 18:03)
you need to stop talking about (18:01 - 18:05)
shakespeare because you do not know what (18:03 - 18:06)
you're talking about number one and (18:05 - 18:08)
number two it's like obviously steve has (18:06 - 18:10)
never picked up a copy of the king james (18:08 - 18:11)
bible which is (18:10 - 18:14)
in that language (18:11 - 18:16)
shakespearean (18:14 - 18:19)
shakespeare it isn't a language it's old (18:16 - 18:21)
english that's not even old english (18:19 - 18:23)
that's just that i don't even know this (18:21 - 18:27)
version of english (18:23 - 18:27)
do we want to talk about the town or do (18:29 - 18:32)
we just want to jump into (18:30 - 18:35)
the obsidian fields uh well (18:32 - 18:37)
i do want to say something about the (18:35 - 18:38)
town (18:37 - 18:39)
um (18:38 - 18:41)
a couple of things (18:39 - 18:44)
number one (18:41 - 18:46)
i found it a little frustrating when we (18:44 - 18:49)
first walk into the town (18:46 - 18:50)
and the professor's like (18:49 - 18:53)
i know you want to talk to everybody (18:50 - 18:55)
don't talk to anybody (18:53 - 18:57)
but then everything else is like you (18:55 - 18:59)
need to talk to everybody yeah (18:57 - 19:01)
um (18:59 - 19:04)
the town is much bigger than first (19:01 - 19:05)
it's like (19:04 - 19:06)
when you first walk through you're like (19:05 - 19:08)
what it's like one street and one street (19:06 - 19:10)
and then you're like oh wait yeah no oh (19:08 - 19:12)
no there's there's a couple of slides i (19:10 - 19:15)
think that i and maybe this is (19:12 - 19:17)
something i'm perceiving that isn't (19:15 - 19:19)
going to pan out later in the game (19:17 - 19:20)
but (19:19 - 19:22)
to me one of the first things i thought (19:20 - 19:25)
of when i walked into jubalife was like (19:22 - 19:26)
wow (19:25 - 19:29)
there aren't any pokemon anywhere (19:26 - 19:32)
this town is empty of pokemon yeah (19:29 - 19:35)
and what i've noticed as i especially as (19:32 - 19:38)
i'm doing the side quests (19:35 - 19:39)
it's like (19:38 - 19:40)
oh (19:39 - 19:42)
i am integrating pokemon into the life (19:40 - 19:45)
of this town yeah it's a very cool touch (19:42 - 19:47)
for this game (19:45 - 19:49)
so i yeah i like that because it's like (19:47 - 19:51)
my presence is changing (19:49 - 19:54)
the world that i'm in well your actions (19:51 - 19:57)
seem to have (19:54 - 19:57)
strong (19:57 - 20:01)
influence which is something i think is (19:59 - 20:03)
missing from a lot of previous games (20:01 - 20:06)
that the world really doesn't change (20:03 - 20:08)
off of what you do (20:06 - 20:11)
and this the world does really begin to (20:08 - 20:12)
change (20:11 - 20:15)
as you make they're not really choices (20:12 - 20:17)
but like as you complete things the (20:15 - 20:19)
world changes i guess it's a choice to (20:17 - 20:21)
not give anyone the pokemon they're (20:19 - 20:24)
asking for like you never have to you (20:21 - 20:25)
never have to do any of the side quests (20:24 - 20:27)
sorry dude i'm sorry you're afraid to go (20:25 - 20:29)
into your house i got life delayed i got (20:27 - 20:30)
stuff to do (20:29 - 20:32)
you're the grown up here (20:30 - 20:34)
that's your problem did you guys do that (20:32 - 20:35)
one (20:34 - 20:38)
because the i'm afraid to go into my (20:35 - 20:40)
house at night yeah oh is that the one (20:38 - 20:43)
with karen and she wants like (20:40 - 20:46)
karen she has like the karen hair (20:43 - 20:49)
sakuan i think is (20:46 - 20:49)
i just know they're i just know what (20:50 - 20:54)
future pokemon people they're based off (20:52 - 20:55)
of (20:54 - 20:57)
she's the head of the (20:55 - 20:59)
construction (20:57 - 21:00)
yeah (20:59 - 21:01)
and she's afraid to go in her house and (21:00 - 21:03)
she's like can you go in and see and (21:01 - 21:06)
investigate and you've (21:03 - 21:08)
i (21:06 - 21:09)
there was one point where you're like at (21:08 - 21:10)
the back of the room and it's like you (21:09 - 21:12)
hear a noise at the front door and you (21:10 - 21:14)
look at the front door and it's like i (21:12 - 21:18)
think i literally saw a demon flash (21:14 - 21:23)
that's a little too scary for kids (21:18 - 21:25)
hey you're 15 in this game (21:23 - 21:27)
true true they make that very clear very (21:25 - 21:29)
weird because in past pokemon games they (21:27 - 21:32)
got away from just mentioning age (21:29 - 21:34)
i'm pretty sure sword and shield and sun (21:32 - 21:35)
and moon ultra sun and moon they don't (21:34 - 21:38)
they don't mention change at all (21:35 - 21:39)
um (21:38 - 21:41)
i (21:39 - 21:43)
i like the i yeah i like what you (21:41 - 21:45)
mentioned about the town where (21:43 - 21:47)
you're adding to it (21:45 - 21:48)
and (21:47 - 21:50)
it's cool because (21:48 - 21:52)
like one of the guys in the house he's (21:50 - 21:55)
like i want to see uh parasect (21:52 - 21:56)
and you can give him (21:55 - 21:58)
you can give him anything you can give (21:56 - 21:59)
him a parasect you can get my shiny (21:58 - 22:00)
parasect you can give him an alpha (21:59 - 22:02)
parasite you can give my shiny alpha (22:00 - 22:05)
parasect and then it will stay there (22:02 - 22:08)
yeah forever i guess (22:05 - 22:10)
i i i (22:08 - 22:13)
did not realize (22:10 - 22:13)
that you could go into most people's (22:14 - 22:17)
houses oh because yeah they don't make (22:15 - 22:20)
that clear it's it's (22:17 - 22:23)
it looks like your standard (22:20 - 22:24)
pokemon (22:23 - 22:26)
these are all just fronts and not (22:24 - 22:30)
actually i have gone into every house (22:26 - 22:32)
with that in sword and chilled like in (22:30 - 22:34)
in nessa's town i pretty sure you can go (22:32 - 22:35)
in every house and she has a bunch of (22:34 - 22:37)
houses (22:35 - 22:39)
along the streets like i want to say (22:37 - 22:42)
there's at least 10 houses that you can (22:39 - 22:43)
actually just (22:42 - 22:44)
straight up walk into they're like the (22:43 - 22:46)
apartments next to each other yeah but (22:44 - 22:48)
you can usually see like in a pokemon (22:46 - 22:50)
game like what kind of a door you can (22:48 - 22:53)
walk oh sure right and there's no that's (22:50 - 22:55)
not clear but i (22:53 - 22:58)
that was like frustrating for me because (22:55 - 23:00)
i did you guys do the pickle jar (22:58 - 23:01)
yes (23:00 - 23:05)
i feel really bad for that geodude um (23:01 - 23:07)
but they're like don't because like that (23:05 - 23:10)
geodude is happy the the quest said (23:07 - 23:11)
like (23:10 - 23:14)
find this no it wasn't it was the starly (23:11 - 23:16)
and it's like (23:14 - 23:18)
this woman and i said her name (23:16 - 23:21)
wants to see the starly and i had it and (23:18 - 23:22)
it was like (23:21 - 23:24)
i don't know where she is (23:22 - 23:26)
and it's like before i figured out how (23:24 - 23:29)
to turn on the task tracking in the arc (23:26 - 23:31)
phone and i was like i was going in (23:29 - 23:32)
every door talking to every person i was (23:31 - 23:34)
like who is this woman i don't even (23:32 - 23:37)
remember asking me for anything (23:34 - 23:39)
where are you uh of all the tutorial (23:37 - 23:42)
things i do wish they had spent a little (23:39 - 23:45)
bit of time on task tracking and putting (23:42 - 23:47)
up markers (23:45 - 23:48)
uh they just sort of (23:47 - 23:50)
don't talk about that at all and it is (23:48 - 23:53)
an incredibly useful feature (23:50 - 23:55)
especially when you have many many side (23:53 - 23:57)
quests that you know who am i talking (23:55 - 23:58)
about (23:57 - 24:00)
see i feel like this game just gave you (23:58 - 24:01)
way (24:00 - 24:03)
i felt like there was way too much (24:01 - 24:04)
dialogue in how to do things because (24:03 - 24:06)
that's yeah yeah you don't like reading (24:04 - 24:09)
but here wait wait scams complete scam (24:06 - 24:11)
master (24:09 - 24:13)
do you you know at the end i think it's (24:11 - 24:15)
the end of clever like right after you (24:13 - 24:17)
defeat clever (24:15 - 24:20)
they're like your arc phone is like oh (24:17 - 24:23)
you can teleport to the field bases now (24:20 - 24:24)
i was like (24:23 - 24:25)
buddy (24:24 - 24:27)
i've been teleporting to those fields (24:25 - 24:30)
ever since i got two of them (24:27 - 24:32)
this is nothing new you have to tell (24:30 - 24:34)
i've been flying around this region (24:32 - 24:35)
through the (24:34 - 24:38)
magic of teleportation (24:35 - 24:38)
or as it shows loading screen shadow (24:39 - 24:42)
running (24:41 - 24:45)
okay i like it i like it (24:42 - 24:47)
yeah it's it's very jarring to hear you (24:45 - 24:49)
both be like (24:47 - 24:51)
this game is this game is light on (24:49 - 24:53)
tutorial because i felt like i it was (24:51 - 24:56)
telling me new things constantly and i (24:53 - 25:00)
was like i know i've already done it (24:56 - 25:01)
i um (25:00 - 25:03)
i don't know what to tell you i (25:01 - 25:04)
and i felt like like even in the (25:03 - 25:06)
dialogue of the characters talking to (25:04 - 25:08)
each other and like doing the story i (25:06 - 25:10)
feel like they're also referencing (25:08 - 25:12)
things you can just straight up do and (25:10 - 25:14)
that's why i was like skipping some of (25:12 - 25:15)
the dialogue because it felt like they (25:14 - 25:18)
were talking around like oh yeah you can (25:15 - 25:20)
do this and it's like yeah i i know (25:18 - 25:23)
well because you saw too many spoilers (25:20 - 25:24)
you ruined it i did not see too many (25:23 - 25:26)
things that's the problem yeah no you (25:24 - 25:27)
watch somebody play the game that's how (25:26 - 25:28)
you (25:27 - 25:30)
got all this info that neither of us (25:28 - 25:32)
have (25:30 - 25:33)
i think (25:32 - 25:35)
you're overestimating the amount of time (25:33 - 25:37)
i want those twitch streamers that got (25:35 - 25:40)
those games early they were unbearable (25:37 - 25:41)
to watch (25:40 - 25:43)
there's a reason they don't exist on (25:41 - 25:44)
touch anymore they had their five (25:43 - 25:48)
minutes of fame it's gone they were they (25:44 - 25:50)
were uh they were not great they were (25:48 - 25:52)
not entertaining enough to watch (25:50 - 25:55)
um (25:52 - 25:55)
do think the side quest (25:56 - 25:59)
i always there's always like a (25:58 - 26:00)
double-edged sword with me for side (25:59 - 26:03)
quests in like any game of like these (26:00 - 26:07)
are too repetitive or too boring or the (26:03 - 26:09)
rewards you're giving me are not worth (26:07 - 26:11)
the time to do (26:09 - 26:14)
and i have this constant fear that if (26:11 - 26:16)
i'm not doing enough before the next (26:14 - 26:20)
noble that they're going to pile up and (26:16 - 26:22)
at the end of the game i'm going to have (26:20 - 26:26)
show trainer a starly to get one potion (26:22 - 26:28)
and it's like (26:26 - 26:30)
so so i'm not saying it's bad i'm just (26:28 - 26:32)
saying i'm worried that i'm not doing (26:30 - 26:34)
them fast enough (26:32 - 26:35)
so (26:34 - 26:36)
uh and i don't want to get to the end of (26:35 - 26:39)
the game after i caught whatever many (26:36 - 26:41)
pokemon and be like oh i still gotta do (26:39 - 26:42)
that like (26:41 - 26:44)
show the guy a tall weasel (26:42 - 26:45)
which is like one of the first side (26:44 - 26:46)
quests you get (26:45 - 26:48)
then very aggravating because he doesn't (26:46 - 26:51)
define what tall bleazel means until you (26:48 - 26:52)
try to bring him a bad one tell you a (26:51 - 26:54)
big one he's like no it needs to be (26:52 - 26:56)
above this size like you could have (26:54 - 26:58)
mentioned that (26:56 - 27:01)
so any point buddy my my counter (26:58 - 27:03)
argument to what you just said is i mean (27:01 - 27:05)
yes (27:03 - 27:06)
the point of the game is to do side (27:05 - 27:09)
quests that's it's it's it's key if (27:06 - 27:10)
you're ignoring this (27:09 - 27:12)
the point of the game is to (27:10 - 27:14)
you know (27:12 - 27:16)
there's the player there's me the player (27:14 - 27:18)
character motivation there's the king of (27:16 - 27:20)
the mpc's motivation and then there's (27:18 - 27:22)
the various motivations that this is (27:20 - 27:24)
literature class here now (27:22 - 27:26)
shakespeare (27:24 - 27:27)
stop almost (27:26 - 27:28)
um (27:27 - 27:29)
we're getting there (27:28 - 27:32)
no if you're nowhere near the side (27:29 - 27:34)
quests as they come (27:32 - 27:36)
you are (27:34 - 27:38)
number you have it's giving you (27:36 - 27:40)
opportunities to complete your pokedex (27:38 - 27:43)
and to level up your pokemon (27:40 - 27:44)
because it's getting you into the field (27:43 - 27:46)
to do things that you might choose to (27:44 - 27:48)
ignore unless you had to do them as a (27:46 - 27:50)
side quest so i think that's where like (27:48 - 27:52)
one of the key benefits of doing the not (27:50 - 27:55)
pick three mushrooms so although then (27:52 - 27:57)
you know you find three mushrooms (27:55 - 27:58)
yeah you know where this is there's a (27:57 - 28:00)
couple where like (27:58 - 28:02)
i pick it up after what they want me to (28:00 - 28:04)
do so i kind of have to do it again (28:02 - 28:05)
oh that weasel one's not getting done (28:04 - 28:08)
until arceus is sitting on my shoulder (28:05 - 28:10)
doing a tap dance because that man he (28:08 - 28:13)
got me so mad he can (28:10 - 28:13)
i mean i will say (28:14 - 28:18)
the pokedex does help (28:19 - 28:24)
with that quest like i realized (28:21 - 28:26)
from what it told me (28:24 - 28:28)
that i had completed that quest (28:26 - 28:30)
oh cause doesn't the like some of the (28:28 - 28:33)
pokedex is like catch five tiny ones or (28:30 - 28:36)
catch five big ones which is like a very (28:33 - 28:38)
pokemon go has that as well with the (28:36 - 28:40)
magikarp and the (28:38 - 28:41)
rattata (28:40 - 28:44)
this is either a frustration or a (28:41 - 28:46)
feature (28:44 - 28:47)
okay (28:46 - 28:50)
of the old f f if you're (28:47 - 28:51)
if you're (28:50 - 28:53)
giving me a page in the pokedex that (28:51 - 28:54)
says (28:53 - 28:58)
do these things to complete this entry (28:54 - 29:00)
how dare you (28:58 - 29:02)
change it (29:00 - 29:03)
as i go (29:02 - 29:06)
do not add more (29:03 - 29:08)
oh no cyndaquil is like (29:06 - 29:10)
do this do (29:08 - 29:12)
have it do ember uh watch it do a quick (29:10 - 29:14)
attack and then you go back later and (29:12 - 29:15)
it's like (29:14 - 29:18)
see it do flame wheel five times it was (29:15 - 29:20)
like excuse me that wasn't it just for (29:18 - 29:23)
the starter no no no all of them do that (29:20 - 29:26)
all of them do that (29:23 - 29:28)
are you talking about ones that evolve (29:26 - 29:31)
no just like ones that do anything when (29:28 - 29:33)
they learn a new move then it's like (29:31 - 29:35)
watch it do this new move (29:33 - 29:37)
if you look at some of them (29:35 - 29:40)
before you get introduced to the (29:37 - 29:41)
uh (29:40 - 29:43)
agile strong style that's not in the (29:41 - 29:46)
pokedex and then it's there yeah once (29:43 - 29:47)
they talk about it then it's like see (29:46 - 29:50)
them do agile and see them do strong it (29:47 - 29:52)
does change (29:50 - 29:54)
um (29:52 - 29:56)
so (29:54 - 30:00)
yeah the the the moving requirements do (29:56 - 30:02)
they do but they do as you get (30:00 - 30:03)
introduced to mechanics and it wants (30:02 - 30:05)
different things the pokedex does it's (30:03 - 30:09)
like the the very logic driven my which (30:05 - 30:11)
i tend to fall into that i want steps to (30:09 - 30:12)
follow and do (30:11 - 30:14)
is like (30:12 - 30:16)
just just tell me because i if i want to (30:14 - 30:19)
do like 100 completion of this pokedex i (30:16 - 30:21)
want to do every single one of these (30:19 - 30:22)
things (30:21 - 30:24)
and then the the more like oh hey (30:22 - 30:26)
they're actually making pokedex (30:24 - 30:28)
completion a little easier it's saying (30:26 - 30:29)
all right we're giving you different (30:28 - 30:31)
opportunities as you go of ways to (30:29 - 30:34)
complete these pokedex entries so that (30:31 - 30:36)
you don't have to be fixated on the ones (30:34 - 30:38)
that you haven't done (30:36 - 30:41)
yeah i mean complete isn't perfect (30:38 - 30:42)
yes (30:41 - 30:45)
do they stop counting after ten (30:42 - 30:48)
so even if you they do stop counting (30:45 - 30:50)
after ten so it goes from one to ten and (30:48 - 30:53)
then just randomly perfect (30:50 - 30:54)
okay (30:53 - 30:56)
uh which is like part of the shiny (30:54 - 30:58)
hunting method it's you get i have a (30:56 - 31:01)
perfect badoo pace you get a uh plus (30:58 - 31:03)
one roll for getting a pokemon to 10 and (31:01 - 31:06)
then you get a plus two roll on top of (31:03 - 31:08)
the plus one roll for getting it to (31:06 - 31:09)
perfect (31:08 - 31:11)
i think whatever i don't have it in (31:09 - 31:13)
front of me but i believe that is (31:11 - 31:16)
correct maybe it's a plus three (31:13 - 31:17)
um (31:16 - 31:21)
the the wild area or obsidian fields is (31:17 - 31:22)
like both (31:21 - 31:23)
big (31:22 - 31:27)
and small at the same time (31:23 - 31:29)
and i don't know if it's because the (31:27 - 31:32)
character just moves quicker (31:29 - 31:34)
but a good (31:32 - 31:38)
in my a good example is that it takes (31:34 - 31:40)
one minute and 45 seconds for your (31:38 - 31:42)
character to run (31:40 - 31:44)
from the first base to camp to the (31:42 - 31:47)
second base camp which is exactly pretty (31:44 - 31:48)
much in the middle (31:47 - 31:50)
so at the second base camp it would then (31:48 - 31:53)
take you a minute 45 to run to the other (31:50 - 31:54)
end of that map (31:53 - 31:57)
if only you could go so straight sure (31:54 - 31:59)
you can yeah you can go it's a straight (31:57 - 32:01)
shot from base camp one to base game two (31:59 - 32:06)
three two two but from two to the arena (32:01 - 32:09)
there's you gotta do that river thingy (32:06 - 32:10)
and (32:09 - 32:12)
oh no you just you just breath the wild (32:10 - 32:13)
just climb over every mountain keep (32:12 - 32:16)
going straight i have (32:13 - 32:19)
fallen off a lot of mountains i drowned (32:16 - 32:20)
once (32:19 - 32:23)
i've drawn a number of guys i'm i know (32:20 - 32:25)
to be cautious (32:23 - 32:27)
and i i'd have to go back and i think (32:25 - 32:28)
it's because your character just moves (32:27 - 32:29)
quicker (32:28 - 32:31)
but i'm pretty sure in sword and shield (32:29 - 32:33)
to get from the onyx that's like the (32:31 - 32:34)
first big spawn you see in sword and (32:33 - 32:37)
shield to the gate is like a four minute (32:34 - 32:38)
walk (32:37 - 32:40)
and i only know that is because speed (32:38 - 32:42)
runners will run into the onyx purposely (32:40 - 32:44)
have onyx knock them out and then they (32:42 - 32:46)
get teleported to the gate so they don't (32:44 - 32:48)
have to do that walk (32:46 - 32:50)
what about on the bike (32:48 - 32:52)
i have not tested bike (32:50 - 32:55)
so i don't know if like is it (32:52 - 32:57)
sword and shield walking (32:55 - 32:58)
then legends (32:57 - 33:01)
running and then bike and then weird (32:58 - 33:04)
deer like i'm it it again i it's not a (33:01 - 33:06)
complaint (33:04 - 33:08)
like why is this an issue yeah it's just (33:06 - 33:10)
you can be even though the area is (33:08 - 33:12)
bigger (33:10 - 33:12)
because your character moves (33:13 - 33:16)
faster (33:15 - 33:17)
not fast enough because i use (33:16 - 33:19)
teleportation (33:17 - 33:21)
not running through that but also it's (33:19 - 33:23)
it's very wide (33:21 - 33:26)
like maybe the straight shot across is (33:23 - 33:28)
fast like from from what's in front of (33:26 - 33:32)
you to the original it's like a square (33:28 - 33:34)
i i don't know it's just there's so many (33:32 - 33:36)
things i have to go up and over and find (33:34 - 33:38)
ways across that river it just seems to (33:36 - 33:41)
take me so maybe i just get lost i just (33:38 - 33:42)
well i have to get lost all the time i (33:41 - 33:44)
just wander around like i have no idea (33:42 - 33:47)
where i am found your satchel though (33:44 - 33:48)
clumsy (33:47 - 33:50)
yeah way to go (33:48 - 33:51)
i will die every time for a shiny (33:50 - 33:54)
pikachu don't you worry (33:51 - 33:54)
like i i i do think you can just (33:56 - 34:02)
traverse the map really quick like there (33:59 - 34:03)
was a part of the map that's like (34:02 - 34:07)
straight down and i ca i got there in (34:03 - 34:08)
like 30 seconds i've never been there (34:07 - 34:10)
before that was like the last part of (34:08 - 34:12)
the mat that was actually i was probably (34:10 - 34:14)
10 hours into obsidian field and there (34:12 - 34:16)
was a part of the map i never went to (34:14 - 34:18)
and that's where the mr mimes and the (34:16 - 34:21)
gastrodons are i ain't been there yet (34:18 - 34:22)
and the first time i was there like the (34:21 - 34:24)
first time i looked at the map i was (34:22 - 34:25)
like oh i need to go there and then i (34:24 - 34:26)
got there in like 30 seconds and i was (34:25 - 34:28)
like i'm here now (34:26 - 34:30)
but the thing is like if you have a (34:28 - 34:31)
purpose (34:30 - 34:34)
why is that a problem well (34:31 - 34:36)
because when you can get places it makes (34:34 - 34:38)
it feel smaller quicker (34:36 - 34:41)
but but i think like think about how (34:38 - 34:42)
like think about walking through the (34:41 - 34:43)
first gate of sword and shield and then (34:42 - 34:46)
walking all the way to hammerhead fields (34:43 - 34:47)
even on your bike (34:46 - 34:49)
you're going through a lot you're like (34:47 - 34:50)
going around the lane (34:49 - 34:52)
i still feel like obsidian fields is (34:50 - 34:56)
bigger than the entire wow (34:52 - 34:58)
it is physically bigger i am not (34:56 - 35:01)
debating that but because you can (34:58 - 35:03)
explore it so much quicker with the (35:01 - 35:05)
tools they give you which is not a bad (35:03 - 35:07)
thing (35:05 - 35:09)
but you can just zoom through that map (35:07 - 35:11)
so quick i also think part of the (35:09 - 35:13)
problem is i mean and maybe this is a me (35:11 - 35:14)
thing (35:13 - 35:17)
is if i see resources (35:14 - 35:20)
i get the resources i don't ever like (35:17 - 35:22)
but they don't slow me down that's like (35:20 - 35:23)
uh (35:22 - 35:26)
i'm not that good i did i just like kind (35:23 - 35:29)
of stop and look and see what's going on (35:26 - 35:31)
and (35:29 - 35:34)
i just i'm i'm still exploring i'm still (35:31 - 35:36)
looking at stuff (35:34 - 35:38)
i'm not i'm not running out to get a (35:36 - 35:40)
gastrodon i want to watch the sunset (35:38 - 35:42)
like i i love (35:40 - 35:44)
gathering resources and i am so (35:42 - 35:45)
overcrafting (35:44 - 35:47)
wait do you guys know you can sprint (35:45 - 35:50)
yes yeah and then you get out of breath (35:47 - 35:52)
yeah (35:50 - 35:54)
i never sprint (35:52 - 35:57)
i am (35:54 - 35:57)
my (35:58 - 36:02)
least favorite mechanic in all games is (35:58 - 36:04)
inventory management (36:02 - 36:05)
i hate it (36:04 - 36:08)
so much (36:05 - 36:10)
just hate it well you can pay (36:08 - 36:14)
dude mar in the in the headquarters is a (36:10 - 36:16)
million dollars so you can bat oh you (36:14 - 36:17)
know his name (36:16 - 36:20)
yeah bagging for my cash is what it's (36:17 - 36:21)
like (36:20 - 36:23)
so he can give you one slot (36:21 - 36:26)
i hate it and it does nothing for this (36:23 - 36:28)
game (36:26 - 36:29)
what i think it's fine what are you (36:28 - 36:31)
carrying with you what do you need (36:29 - 36:32)
i know people who haven't upgraded their (36:31 - 36:34)
bag at all and they're like 20 hours in (36:32 - 36:36)
and they're fine yeah what do they need (36:34 - 36:38)
to carry keep going back to dump stuff (36:36 - 36:39)
out and (36:38 - 36:40)
yeah i don't want to have to think about (36:39 - 36:43)
it but i just literally said how you you (36:40 - 36:46)
can fast travel it takes like 30 seconds (36:43 - 36:48)
to get back to your box (36:46 - 36:49)
what are you doing what's all the (36:48 - 36:51)
opportunities between where you were and (36:49 - 36:53)
where your box is (36:51 - 36:56)
what (36:53 - 36:56)
showed up and you zapped right past it (36:57 - 37:03)
i i agree with greg that inventory (37:00 - 37:05)
management like in most games is (37:03 - 37:07)
terrible i played a lot of fallout (37:05 - 37:10)
fallout 3 fallout 4. i uh over over (37:07 - 37:12)
encumbered i i get it but like (37:10 - 37:15)
you just fast travel and drop it off or (37:12 - 37:16)
or just not (37:15 - 37:17)
most of the stuff you need with you you (37:16 - 37:20)
just don't need just like stop taking (37:17 - 37:23)
flowers with you i (37:20 - 37:23)
it's the issue of (37:23 - 37:28)
i don't want to pay attention to it i'll (37:26 - 37:30)
get to a spot and it's like you're full (37:28 - 37:31)
and i'm like (37:30 - 37:34)
oh the other thing i have why do i have (37:31 - 37:37)
to deal with this why i don't (37:34 - 37:40)
i don't want to go back and then work my (37:37 - 37:42)
way back here i just got here i i don't (37:40 - 37:45)
want to fast travel back well if you (37:42 - 37:47)
just got there and you're full you do it (37:45 - 37:48)
you have not played enough monster (37:47 - 37:50)
hunter you got to prep for the hunt you (37:48 - 37:52)
gotta cook you gotta eat you gotta (37:50 - 37:54)
unpack you gotta pack (37:52 - 37:56)
don't care (37:54 - 37:58)
about inventory management (37:56 - 38:02)
i hate it in every game it's in i hate (37:58 - 38:05)
it it's dumb (38:02 - 38:06)
it is not fun (38:05 - 38:09)
it doesn't add anything to my experience (38:06 - 38:12)
it is stupid (38:09 - 38:14)
i think it the best they did in the (38:12 - 38:15)
other games (38:14 - 38:18)
unlimited bag space (38:15 - 38:20)
and then i have to pay for more slots (38:18 - 38:21)
and then i'll see a bunch of money then (38:20 - 38:23)
the problem is greg would be complaining (38:21 - 38:25)
that the the game's not realistic enough (38:23 - 38:27)
this is what gives you realism you've (38:25 - 38:28)
got you only got so much baggage (38:27 - 38:31)
hermione granger here (38:28 - 38:34)
do you think it's fun packing for a trip (38:31 - 38:36)
i hate yeah i really do like that i love (38:34 - 38:39)
that whole like i hate it if i get my (38:36 - 38:42)
bag to 40 pounds how much stuff can i (38:39 - 38:44)
buy souvenirs to come back before the (38:42 - 38:47)
airport yells at me yeah i i i feel like (38:44 - 38:49)
the the the (38:47 - 38:52)
taking items out to do a specific task (38:49 - 38:54)
in pokemon not only fits (38:52 - 38:57)
that world but it also reminds me of (38:54 - 38:58)
like (38:57 - 39:00)
setting up a hunt in sos (38:58 - 39:03)
is like okay i know that this pokemon is (39:00 - 39:05)
going to do some sleep stuff i know this (39:03 - 39:06)
is pokemon is going to recover i know (39:05 - 39:09)
this pokemon like the the setting up for (39:06 - 39:11)
a shiny hunt of being like i'm bringing (39:09 - 39:13)
this one i'm bringing this one i'm maybe (39:11 - 39:14)
i'm even hunting graveler he's gonna (39:13 - 39:16)
explode so i'm gonna run a pokemon with (39:14 - 39:19)
damp i like the planning that goes into (39:16 - 39:20)
the hunt (39:19 - 39:22)
and while i agree that inventory (39:20 - 39:24)
management can be a bummer i do like the (39:22 - 39:27)
planning of like my task today is i'm (39:24 - 39:28)
gonna go out and find cherubi (39:27 - 39:31)
and i don't need potions i don't need ex (39:28 - 39:32)
attack (39:31 - 39:34)
alcohol or whatever they decided to (39:32 - 39:36)
rename x attack i don't need these (39:34 - 39:38)
flowers i'm going to only take one type (39:36 - 39:40)
of berry because for the most part (39:38 - 39:43)
berries are all doing the same thing i (39:40 - 39:45)
haven't really figured out why i would (39:43 - 39:48)
want now nana berry over raspberry it (39:45 - 39:50)
seems like they're all doing the same (39:48 - 39:51)
thing (39:50 - 39:53)
um (39:51 - 39:54)
like i like (39:53 - 39:57)
early in the game i i was full and then (39:54 - 39:58)
i realized i was like i don't need any (39:57 - 40:00)
of this stuff why am i i do think the (39:58 - 40:02)
berries do affect them the same way it (40:00 - 40:04)
happens and go (40:02 - 40:06)
i do think there is if you throw out (40:04 - 40:07)
that (40:06 - 40:08)
berry (40:07 - 40:11)
it does affect their behavior well (40:08 - 40:12)
there's (40:11 - 40:15)
throwing the berry into the field (40:12 - 40:16)
versus (40:15 - 40:18)
giving the berry to one of your pokemon (40:16 - 40:20)
to heal a status quo or so that's why (40:18 - 40:22)
they have the different berries (40:20 - 40:24)
i don't know i think throwing the in the (40:22 - 40:27)
field does do different things (40:24 - 40:29)
yeah i'm sure they do i haven't really (40:27 - 40:31)
like messed with that i know like one of (40:29 - 40:33)
the tasks was feed teddy ursa 10 times (40:31 - 40:35)
and i was i was like oh bears love honey (40:33 - 40:37)
i don't know i got all this honey on me (40:35 - 40:39)
and it was eating the honey definitely (40:37 - 40:41)
eat but it wasn't counting and then i (40:39 - 40:43)
switched to a cherry berry and then that (40:41 - 40:46)
was counting and it honey's a sweetener (40:43 - 40:48)
it's not a food it's a condiment it was (40:46 - 40:49)
it was weird that i watched it eat the (40:48 - 40:51)
honey and it didn't (40:49 - 40:54)
count highly is counted for me (40:51 - 40:56)
yeah it was i was like is it broken (40:54 - 40:58)
what's happening but when i said it's (40:56 - 41:01)
weird because i've i've used i've like i (40:58 - 41:02)
had to feed badou a million times and (41:01 - 41:04)
i've had it honey i fed it all a bunch (41:02 - 41:07)
of stuff i wonder if certain pokemon (41:04 - 41:11)
only classifies certain food to be maybe (41:07 - 41:13)
when you look at the pokedex and see if (41:11 - 41:15)
it's got uh (41:13 - 41:17)
but that's his favorite food i don't (41:15 - 41:18)
know yeah i don't because i know for (41:17 - 41:21)
some of the item descriptions like for (41:18 - 41:22)
the (41:21 - 41:24)
it's like the honey cake and the (41:22 - 41:26)
dazzling honey oh i haven't used any of (41:24 - 41:29)
those i don't know like so in the (41:26 - 41:32)
description it literally says (41:29 - 41:32)
uh (41:32 - 41:35)
this will attract bug and fairy type (41:32 - 41:38)
pokemon oh okay (41:35 - 41:40)
so like yeah i haven't done any of the (41:38 - 41:42)
cake stuff that's like not the name of (41:40 - 41:43)
the cake stuff (41:42 - 41:46)
um (41:43 - 41:46)
a lot of reviews that (41:46 - 41:51)
that i read (41:49 - 41:54)
talked about how (41:51 - 41:56)
the f (41:54 - 41:58)
wild i keep calling it a while there i (41:56 - 41:59)
don't know what else to call it obsidian (41:58 - 42:02)
fields obsidian yeah but like it's going (41:59 - 42:04)
to apply for the other four areas (42:02 - 42:05)
like (42:04 - 42:08)
some of the reviews i read said that (42:05 - 42:10)
they feel at the fields field empty or (42:08 - 42:12)
the wild area feels empty or there's (42:10 - 42:14)
nothing to do which i can kind of see (42:12 - 42:15)
what (42:14 - 42:17)
i can kind of see what they're saying (42:15 - 42:22)
um like it is it is less populated than (42:17 - 42:24)
sword and shields wild area right like (42:22 - 42:26)
do you remember the island where you go (42:24 - 42:28)
to it and then like 18 beware pop-up or (42:26 - 42:31)
if it's raining (42:28 - 42:33)
like there's not a point in legends (42:31 - 42:36)
where you're you're actually seeing 18 (42:33 - 42:37)
pokemon (42:36 - 42:39)
um (42:37 - 42:41)
well except for geodudes there's so many (42:39 - 42:44)
dang geodudes too many dods and they're (42:41 - 42:46)
wild i'm killing you i am going to (42:44 - 42:48)
disagree with that point but i am (42:46 - 42:51)
further in the game yeah but but (42:48 - 42:52)
like when you walk first out you see (42:51 - 42:55)
three b deuce and maybe you see one or (42:52 - 42:58)
two starly's but you you don't see like (42:55 - 42:59)
10 pokemon but i think that's more (42:58 - 43:01)
realistic (42:59 - 43:03)
no no i agree because it's like mixed (43:01 - 43:05)
gives you i was just i was setting up (43:03 - 43:06)
the point (43:05 - 43:07)
i i like (43:06 - 43:10)
right outside the kingler beware isle (43:07 - 43:11)
there's like that duskill area and you (43:10 - 43:15)
do see like a dozen duskol (43:11 - 43:17)
and even when i got to (43:15 - 43:19)
i'm trying to think of an area that had (43:17 - 43:20)
more pokemon than normal even like even (43:19 - 43:22)
an outbreak there's not that there's (43:20 - 43:24)
only four at a time (43:22 - 43:25)
um (43:24 - 43:26)
where the stantlers were there were a (43:25 - 43:28)
ton of stantlers (43:26 - 43:30)
and they were real mad that i walked up (43:28 - 43:31)
on them (43:30 - 43:32)
like when i went down to the gastrodon (43:31 - 43:35)
area there was probably four gastrodon (43:32 - 43:37)
and maybe like three shellows and i was (43:35 - 43:39)
like wow this is but that but that whole (43:37 - 43:40)
beach that was like the whole beach was (43:39 - 43:42)
pretty big (43:40 - 43:44)
i don't think it's a bad thing i think (43:42 - 43:46)
that like because of the nature of this (43:44 - 43:50)
game and because they're going for this (43:46 - 43:50)
like more (43:50 - 43:56)
detailed wild area maybe i guess (43:52 - 43:59)
that it feels more natural you know like (43:56 - 44:01)
if you're walking into a an actual (43:59 - 44:03)
forest you're not seeing (44:01 - 44:05)
if you're walking in an actual forest (44:03 - 44:07)
you aren't seeing animals because they (44:05 - 44:09)
generally avoid you (44:07 - 44:10)
right so (44:09 - 44:15)
like apart from squirrels and birds (44:10 - 44:17)
all of whom are gonna run the minute you (44:15 - 44:19)
get close you might maybe see a rabbit (44:17 - 44:22)
maybe a bird i mean that sounds like my (44:19 - 44:24)
backyard but but they also like (44:22 - 44:26)
spawn (44:24 - 44:28)
pretty quickly it's like you can't (44:26 - 44:31)
really depopulate an area without (44:28 - 44:33)
turning around and having some more show (44:31 - 44:34)
up (44:33 - 44:36)
you know where you um (44:34 - 44:38)
you breed in the wild area (44:36 - 44:40)
yes between the two there's like there's (44:38 - 44:42)
like the obstacle in there yes if you (44:40 - 44:43)
ride your bike (44:42 - 44:45)
okay when you when you ride your bike up (44:43 - 44:47)
and down (44:45 - 44:48)
you probably see (44:47 - 44:51)
25 to 30 pokemon (44:48 - 44:55)
from like the the nursery to the alchemy (44:51 - 44:57)
uh den which is (44:55 - 44:58)
straight across it's just like to me (44:57 - 45:01)
that's just like it's not realistic like (44:58 - 45:03)
am i really going to be going someplace (45:01 - 45:06)
and seeing eight pokemon in this tiny (45:03 - 45:09)
patch of grass all hanging out (45:06 - 45:10)
at the same time (45:09 - 45:13)
i think i just feel better yeah legend (45:10 - 45:14)
feels way better because those things (45:13 - 45:16)
come and try to kill you a lot (45:14 - 45:18)
and if it was 17 of them i'd be like i (45:16 - 45:20)
cannot i'm already at the point where in (45:18 - 45:22)
this game we're like i cannot i cannot (45:20 - 45:24)
deal with this area right (45:22 - 45:26)
this whole section and it's like (45:24 - 45:29)
rapidash go away (45:26 - 45:32)
that's why i think the movement is just (45:29 - 45:34)
so much faster (45:32 - 45:36)
because even though (45:34 - 45:37)
you're only seeing like (45:36 - 45:40)
in my head it's like here's a patch of (45:37 - 45:42)
bdoofs here's a patch of badoos here's a (45:40 - 45:44)
patch of psyducks and there's like one (45:42 - 45:45)
or two pokemon that kind of like (45:44 - 45:48)
transition that into it (45:45 - 45:49)
um (45:48 - 45:51)
but you because your character moves so (45:49 - 45:53)
quickly it just it does feel like you (45:51 - 45:55)
were consistently seeing pokemon whereas (45:53 - 45:56)
if your movement was as slow as it was (45:55 - 45:58)
in sword and shield which i think it's (45:56 - 45:59)
sort of chill you don't even move that (45:58 - 46:00)
slow i think you move really fast in the (45:59 - 46:02)
sword and shield too (46:00 - 46:04)
um like it feels like it takes longer to (46:02 - 46:06)
traverse so even though like (46:04 - 46:09)
it's not as jam-packed as the grass (46:06 - 46:11)
patches in sword and shield i do think (46:09 - 46:12)
it feels natural and i think it feels (46:11 - 46:15)
good but i guess i could maybe see why (46:12 - 46:17)
reviewers would would be like oh yeah (46:15 - 46:19)
there's nothing to really do in these (46:17 - 46:20)
areas (46:19 - 46:21)
but also (46:20 - 46:23)
maybe that's the case when you're like a (46:21 - 46:25)
hundred hours in because i i have the (46:23 - 46:27)
problem i had in like breath of the wild (46:25 - 46:29)
sorry we're bringing a breath of wild (46:27 - 46:30)
but (46:29 - 46:32)
i i have like four things i want to do (46:30 - 46:34)
at once (46:32 - 46:37)
it's like do i want to (46:34 - 46:39)
do this side quest do i want to go to (46:37 - 46:41)
this area that's unexplored a distortion (46:39 - 46:43)
just popped up i'm still looking for (46:41 - 46:44)
this cherubi (46:43 - 46:47)
um i haven't progressed the story (46:44 - 46:50)
oh somebody just lost their satchel (46:47 - 46:51)
like (46:50 - 46:54)
people lose their satchels a lot in this (46:51 - 46:56)
game and i don't know what they're doing (46:54 - 46:58)
stop being so careless why are you all (46:56 - 47:01)
so clumsy (46:58 - 47:01)
yeah i think the concept of there's not (47:01 - 47:06)
enough to do is (47:04 - 47:07)
more (47:06 - 47:10)
like the person who's saying that has a (47:07 - 47:13)
limited range of what they want to do (47:10 - 47:17)
yeah because this game gives you plenty (47:13 - 47:18)
there is (47:17 - 47:21)
just doing pokedex completion (47:18 - 47:24)
probably take you a year if you wanted (47:21 - 47:26)
to do like a full (47:24 - 47:28)
everything that it asks for there (47:26 - 47:30)
and just yeah (47:28 - 47:33)
there's just there's tons (47:30 - 47:35)
as long as you're willing to you know do (47:33 - 47:36)
what the game is guiding you as like (47:35 - 47:40)
this is what you have to do (47:36 - 47:40)
yeah there could be the the other worry (47:40 - 47:44)
i had was like in final fantasy 15 which (47:42 - 47:46)
is an open world game (47:44 - 47:49)
um they had a bunch of side quests (47:46 - 47:52)
and not only were they not fun (47:49 - 47:54)
they like took forever to get to and (47:52 - 47:56)
they gave you garbage rewards (47:54 - 47:57)
and i will (47:56 - 47:59)
i will say that the most of the rewards (47:57 - 48:02)
you get from the side quests in legends (47:59 - 48:04)
are not great (48:02 - 48:05)
no (48:04 - 48:07)
they're not they're not great but i (48:05 - 48:10)
think they're they're easy enough (48:07 - 48:12)
to grab (48:10 - 48:14)
and to not think about and then to do (48:12 - 48:17)
while you're doing it which the thing (48:14 - 48:20)
that saves the side quests for me is (48:17 - 48:21)
most of them have an interesting (48:20 - 48:24)
storyline behind them (48:21 - 48:26)
so i don't care about the rewards i (48:24 - 48:29)
what they are telling me about the world (48:26 - 48:31)
and the people that are in it make up (48:29 - 48:33)
for the fact that (48:31 - 48:35)
this is another (48:33 - 48:37)
herb i'm never gonna use and i'm just (48:35 - 48:40)
gonna dump it in a box and also if a (48:37 - 48:42)
side quest is show me a completed page (48:40 - 48:44)
for this pokemon which a number of them (48:42 - 48:45)
are (48:44 - 48:48)
yeah i was gonna do that anyway yeah i (48:45 - 48:49)
think i think there are really i think (48:48 - 48:51)
the the structure of side quests are (48:49 - 48:52)
good there are some that are like here's (48:51 - 48:55)
a half of picture of a pokemon (48:52 - 48:57)
find that for me and that's great yeah i (48:55 - 48:58)
think those are really clever and then (48:57 - 49:00)
there's the one where they they describe (48:58 - 49:02)
you a pokemon like there's a girl in the (49:00 - 49:04)
basement of the headquarters she's like (49:02 - 49:06)
i'm looking for a (49:04 - 49:08)
pokemon that's like blue and has vines (49:06 - 49:11)
everywhere and like yeah (49:08 - 49:12)
and like that structure of quest is (49:11 - 49:13)
really cool because you don't even have (49:12 - 49:15)
to do a story for those two you're just (49:13 - 49:18)
like it's like a who's that pokemon but (49:15 - 49:21)
in quest form and then yeah there's like (49:18 - 49:22)
find the (49:21 - 49:25)
um like fill out the pokedex page hey (49:22 - 49:27)
bring me this specific pokemon (49:25 - 49:31)
um the farm area which i (49:27 - 49:34)
feel like they don't ex this was another (49:31 - 49:36)
thing they didn't show in the trailers (49:34 - 49:38)
the pastures are the berries the the the (49:36 - 49:41)
farm where you can either grow apricorns (49:38 - 49:45)
berries like and then you can expand it (49:41 - 49:47)
a lot um (49:45 - 49:47)
and (49:47 - 49:49)
the thing that i actually think the game (49:47 - 49:50)
does (49:49 - 49:52)
bad (49:50 - 49:54)
is telling you to go back to juba life (49:52 - 49:56)
more often than you should (49:54 - 49:57)
and i think maybe like this kind of (49:56 - 49:59)
brings me back to when greg was like (49:57 - 50:01)
inventory management sucks (49:59 - 50:03)
i just think you're in the field way too (50:01 - 50:04)
long (50:03 - 50:05)
like you should you kind of should go (50:04 - 50:07)
out there do what you want to do (50:05 - 50:08)
obviously if you want to explore explore (50:07 - 50:10)
but like then you should set up your (50:08 - 50:12)
like okay i'm going to drop some stuff (50:10 - 50:13)
off i'm going to explore fresh because (50:12 - 50:14)
i'm going to come back with a lot of (50:13 - 50:17)
stuff but in my first like 10 hours (50:14 - 50:19)
i felt like i went back to juba life (50:17 - 50:21)
like only when they were like you need (50:19 - 50:24)
to go back to juba life but in reality (50:21 - 50:26)
you should be going back to jube life (50:24 - 50:27)
more (50:26 - 50:29)
because you need to check the farm (50:27 - 50:32)
um and then the board in the professor's (50:29 - 50:35)
house gets updated and then you can do (50:32 - 50:37)
your inventory management there and then (50:35 - 50:39)
when you leave (50:37 - 50:41)
russ or whatever his name is he'll tell (50:39 - 50:43)
you if there's an outbreak (50:41 - 50:45)
which that's like kind of the talk of (50:43 - 50:48)
the town well the talk of the irl that's (50:45 - 50:51)
like the talk of pokemon fans is like (50:48 - 50:53)
how do we get outbreaks (50:51 - 50:55)
there are two things that happen in the (50:53 - 50:56)
game one is like the distortions which (50:55 - 50:59)
are those huge domes that appear (50:56 - 51:02)
and then when you go into the dome (50:59 - 51:02)
once you see one they're all kind of the (51:04 - 51:07)
same (51:06 - 51:09)
they are star locked (51:07 - 51:13)
so until i know outbreaks are (51:09 - 51:15)
yeah because i haven't had outbreaks yet (51:13 - 51:19)
either i i think distortions are (51:15 - 51:21)
probably three i would guess three and i (51:19 - 51:24)
think outbreaks are four star (51:21 - 51:27)
you can get outbreaks before cleaver (51:24 - 51:29)
right but they are they are your star (51:27 - 51:32)
rank level based they unlock with stars (51:29 - 51:34)
so if if you don't get them if you don't (51:32 - 51:35)
get the stars you're never gonna you're (51:34 - 51:37)
not gonna run into them you think you (51:35 - 51:38)
think uh distortions i mean we could (51:37 - 51:40)
look it up on serbia but distortions (51:38 - 51:43)
seem way harder than (51:40 - 51:43)
than outside they are yeah i mean (51:44 - 51:48)
they're harder to do but i i i think (51:46 - 51:50)
outbreaks are unlocked at i could have (51:48 - 51:52)
them reversed because i don't that i i (51:50 - 51:55)
got them close to each other and around (51:52 - 51:57)
the same stars and i wasn't (51:55 - 51:58)
paying you that much if it's star locked (51:57 - 52:00)
because that i haven't seen but i know (51:58 - 52:02)
they're starlock so so for distortions (52:00 - 52:04)
you'll just be running around and (52:02 - 52:05)
exploring and then it will say a (52:04 - 52:07)
distortion appeared (52:05 - 52:10)
and then you'll see like this huge like (52:07 - 52:12)
you played you you remember the the the (52:10 - 52:14)
taken in destiny (52:12 - 52:15)
yes (52:14 - 52:18)
it's like they put up this huge dome (52:15 - 52:19)
and when you go into the dome your (52:18 - 52:21)
vision gets blurry for a second and then (52:19 - 52:23)
it gets really dark (52:21 - 52:25)
and then you're you're participating in (52:23 - 52:26)
a like a (52:25 - 52:28)
a public event in the dome (52:26 - 52:30)
and what will happen is the pokemon in (52:28 - 52:33)
the dome like if it's b doof they'll (52:30 - 52:35)
despawn just like in a public event all (52:33 - 52:36)
those (52:35 - 52:37)
uh (52:36 - 52:39)
uh destiny characters d spawn and then (52:37 - 52:41)
new characters will spawn in three at a (52:39 - 52:43)
time and it will be like (52:41 - 52:46)
ursa rings and float soles and like (52:43 - 52:48)
porygons it'll be like pokemon you're (52:46 - 52:51)
not just kill you (52:48 - 52:54)
and you can you can hide in the grass (52:51 - 52:55)
and like try to catch them and then (52:54 - 52:57)
after i think it's like 30 seconds they (52:55 - 53:00)
despawn and then three more spawn in (52:57 - 53:02)
it's like uber incense but the the (53:00 - 53:05)
problem is that (53:02 - 53:07)
you can't save and reset in those like (53:05 - 53:09)
so if you save and then you die and then (53:07 - 53:11)
you're like oh i'm just gonna reset like (53:09 - 53:13)
the distortion's gone (53:11 - 53:15)
so if you like saw shiny in a distortion (53:13 - 53:18)
you can't like save in front of it like (53:15 - 53:21)
but right like they they they're (53:18 - 53:23)
mostly evolved pokemon like you can get (53:21 - 53:25)
a gengar in it like i'm like my second (53:23 - 53:27)
distortion i caught gengar (53:25 - 53:29)
and they're a little bit difficult (53:27 - 53:31)
because once they see you (53:29 - 53:32)
you're in like an arena so you can't (53:31 - 53:34)
really like leave it so it's like harder (53:32 - 53:38)
to hide and survive and then also (53:34 - 53:40)
if you choose not to catch (53:38 - 53:42)
there's shards on the ground there's (53:40 - 53:44)
like red shards or green shirts or blue (53:42 - 53:45)
shards so you can like run around and (53:44 - 53:46)
pick them up but also while you're (53:45 - 53:48)
trying to dodge like (53:46 - 53:49)
crock pots (53:48 - 53:51)
and there are crack packs on the ground (53:49 - 53:52)
too (53:51 - 53:54)
so the like the first three i've done i (53:52 - 53:55)
was like wow these are really cool and (53:54 - 53:57)
they're really like they're really (53:55 - 53:58)
tense (53:57 - 54:00)
they are very tense because they (53:58 - 54:01)
literally everything wants to kill you (54:00 - 54:03)
the minute it sees you and you can in (54:01 - 54:07)
most situations in this game i feel like (54:03 - 54:09)
things can either go it's like most (54:07 - 54:11)
stealth games which i kind of like (54:09 - 54:12)
actually hate i'm really bad at stealth (54:11 - 54:13)
games (54:12 - 54:16)
just because i'm bad at them um but it's (54:13 - 54:20)
like if you can stay hidden (54:16 - 54:21)
stealthy (54:20 - 54:24)
it almost goes way too smoothly and the (54:21 - 54:27)
second year scene it's just a disaster (54:24 - 54:28)
yes (54:27 - 54:30)
it's just you are running for your life (54:28 - 54:32)
until they do because the first (54:30 - 54:33)
distortion i did i don't think anyone (54:32 - 54:36)
saw me and i just i caught like 20 (54:33 - 54:38)
pokemon and the distortion was over but (54:36 - 54:39)
i also didn't move from the spot i was (54:38 - 54:42)
in so i didn't pick up any of the shards (54:39 - 54:44)
yeah and then the second person i did i (54:42 - 54:45)
was running around picking things up (54:44 - 54:47)
because i did not understand (54:45 - 54:48)
that (54:47 - 54:50)
they were going to start popping in and (54:48 - 54:53)
then they started popping (54:50 - 54:53)
literally going to die the entire time (54:58 - 55:01)
and i got nothing done because i was (54:59 - 55:03)
just trying to stay alive (55:01 - 55:05)
yeah (55:03 - 55:07)
um outbreaks so the reason you'd want to (55:05 - 55:09)
go back to jubalife is to like check (55:07 - 55:13)
your farm check with any npcs uh (55:09 - 55:14)
buy or sell (55:13 - 55:15)
uh (55:14 - 55:17)
inventory management talk to celine (55:15 - 55:20)
that's her name right celine yep yep uh (55:17 - 55:22)
and then when you leave russ will like (55:20 - 55:24)
tell you if there's an outbreak so (55:22 - 55:25)
unlike so when you're in the field (55:24 - 55:27)
distortions just happen (55:25 - 55:30)
outbreaks don't randomly happen and like (55:27 - 55:32)
because i'm streaming on twitch people (55:30 - 55:33)
are like how are you getting outbreaks i (55:32 - 55:35)
haven't gotten i've played for two days (55:33 - 55:37)
i haven't gotten an outbreak it's like (55:35 - 55:38)
when's the last time you went back to (55:37 - 55:40)
juba life oh i don't know (55:38 - 55:43)
you have to go to jubalife and you have (55:40 - 55:44)
to leave for the guy to tell you if (55:43 - 55:46)
there's an outbreak and if you're not (55:44 - 55:48)
going to jubalife you're never going to (55:46 - 55:49)
get one (55:48 - 55:51)
and the game doesn't really like (55:49 - 55:53)
tell you that it doesn't really like set (55:51 - 55:55)
it up that you should be going back to (55:53 - 55:57)
jubalife more often i mean the farm is (55:55 - 55:59)
like (55:57 - 56:01)
a good enough reason in my opinion to (55:59 - 56:03)
visit jubilife between things (56:01 - 56:05)
but they also haven't started farming (56:03 - 56:06)
yet they also really don't tell you (56:05 - 56:08)
about the farm (56:06 - 56:09)
no they didn't tell you about them it's (56:08 - 56:11)
back there (56:09 - 56:13)
well yeah but you go there and he's like (56:11 - 56:15)
it costs money and we can't guarantee (56:13 - 56:18)
results and i was like well (56:15 - 56:19)
it's true (56:18 - 56:20)
i love farming (56:19 - 56:22)
i don't like the way you're farming it's (56:20 - 56:24)
not like the farm in x and y (56:22 - 56:26)
it's more like (56:24 - 56:29)
it's more like a pokepelego (56:26 - 56:29)
it's not like the bit it's not like the (56:31 - 56:34)
tree thing in pokepelligo it's like the (56:32 - 56:36)
mining thing in pokepeligo where it's (56:34 - 56:38)
like which of these five do you want to (56:36 - 56:41)
do all right come back later (56:38 - 56:43)
that's what it's like (56:41 - 56:44)
speaking of coming back later let's take (56:43 - 56:46)
a break (56:44 - 56:48)
uh when we get back we'll talk more (56:46 - 56:49)
about (56:48 - 56:52)
some other mechanics they've changed and (56:49 - 56:54)
then up to the cleaver fight (56:52 - 56:57)
so we will be right back (56:54 - 56:57)
and we are back (56:58 - 57:03)
okay so we talked a little bit about was (57:01 - 57:05)
we spent like an hour talking about an (57:03 - 57:06)
hour (57:05 - 57:08)
not even not even (57:06 - 57:10)
a little bit about the game (57:08 - 57:12)
here's what i want to say (57:10 - 57:13)
i think this game (57:12 - 57:16)
is absolutely incredible i think it's (57:13 - 57:19)
worth 60 dollars i think yeah absolutely (57:16 - 57:20)
and and that's probably that's the (57:19 - 57:22)
question i've been getting all weekend (57:20 - 57:24)
is what do you think about the game and (57:22 - 57:27)
it really comes down to do you have 60 (57:24 - 57:28)
and do you like pokemon (57:27 - 57:30)
if you do then it's a hundred percent (57:28 - 57:32)
worth it if you hate pokemon and have 60 (57:30 - 57:34)
dollars i don't think so if you like (57:32 - 57:36)
pokemon (57:34 - 57:37)
but don't have 60 (57:36 - 57:39)
maybe you should get 60 (57:37 - 57:42)
i i will say that nintendo did send me a (57:39 - 57:44)
free copy (57:42 - 57:45)
oh (57:44 - 57:47)
well well well well i didn't buy the (57:45 - 57:49)
game twice though i bought it digitally (57:47 - 57:51)
and physically for my physically for (57:49 - 57:53)
myself for my collection digitally for (57:51 - 57:56)
my wife to play and she's she's been (57:53 - 57:57)
enjoying it as well (57:56 - 57:58)
but (57:57 - 58:00)
i i think when it comes down to it i do (57:58 - 58:02)
think the game is incredible i do think (58:00 - 58:04)
it's worth the 60 (58:02 - 58:06)
i do not think it is the best pokemon (58:04 - 58:09)
game ever made no and and it's it's i (58:06 - 58:10)
don't think i don't think i'm being (58:09 - 58:13)
unfair when i say this but i think the (58:10 - 58:14)
reason i don't think it's the best (58:13 - 58:16)
pokemon game is just as simple as (58:14 - 58:19)
there's no competitive scene (58:16 - 58:20)
at all (58:19 - 58:22)
um and actually one of my complaints is (58:20 - 58:24)
how they decided to do battles in this (58:22 - 58:26)
game but that is one of my complaints uh (58:24 - 58:29)
yeah but like it's it's just like the e (58:26 - 58:31)
even if the battle stuff was the same as (58:29 - 58:33)
sword and shield the the fact that there (58:31 - 58:36)
is no like online battling other people (58:33 - 58:37)
in general though just the lack of a (58:36 - 58:39)
competitive scene does dock this points (58:37 - 58:40)
there's no ribbons and marks which i (58:39 - 58:43)
know some people don't care about i like (58:40 - 58:46)
that stuff uh it's not in this game (58:43 - 58:47)
um there's like no breeding in this game (58:46 - 58:51)
at all um so because of like those (58:47 - 58:54)
features it just gets doc doc knocked (58:51 - 58:56)
down i think if (58:54 - 58:57)
the (58:56 - 58:59)
if we take the the world of sword and (58:57 - 59:02)
shield and then replace the olive armor (58:59 - 59:05)
crown tundra and the main wild area with (59:02 - 59:07)
obsidian fields and whatever the other (59:05 - 59:09)
two is all of the routes even (59:07 - 59:12)
yeah i i think it would be like the best (59:09 - 59:15)
pokemon game ever made yeah but even (59:12 - 59:16)
though like (59:15 - 59:17)
the things i do like about the game are (59:16 - 59:19)
not in sword and shield i do think sword (59:17 - 59:21)
and shield is a fuller (59:19 - 59:22)
sword and shield plus the dlc is a (59:21 - 59:24)
fuller from start to finish pokemon (59:22 - 59:26)
experience where you're doing (59:24 - 59:28)
a lot more (59:26 - 59:30)
but i think what they have here (59:28 - 59:33)
is still incredible i think it's great (59:30 - 59:35)
um it's a solid i want to say it's (59:33 - 59:37)
either it's a solid a minus there are (59:35 - 59:38)
things that (59:37 - 59:41)
i definitely (59:38 - 59:41)
feel let down by (59:42 - 59:48)
um i think (59:45 - 59:48)
the agile strong system (59:48 - 59:55)
isn't interesting enough (59:53 - 59:57)
it doesn't really seem to have (59:55 - 59:59)
it it seems to suggest that it should (59:57 - 60:02)
have a much stronger (59:59 - 60:02)
impact on the game and it just doesn't (60:02 - 60:09)
uh i feel trainer battles were shoe they (60:06 - 60:12)
always feel shoehorned in (60:09 - 60:16)
like i i am like i said second noble (60:12 - 60:18)
i've done seven trainer battles three (60:16 - 60:20)
have been against the (60:18 - 60:22)
rival or whatever and i don't know why (60:20 - 60:24)
they don't (60:22 - 60:27)
they just feel like why are you why why (60:24 - 60:29)
this isn't what this game is for (60:27 - 60:31)
um (60:29 - 60:31)
i also have an issue with the color (60:32 - 60:38)
palette they chose for the game (60:36 - 60:41)
i do find something hard to see yes the (60:38 - 60:43)
did you see there's like a tweet going (60:41 - 60:45)
around it's legends running on an (60:43 - 60:47)
original switch and legends running on (60:45 - 60:49)
an oled and it's like (60:47 - 60:51)
night and day different in colors (60:49 - 60:53)
like it looks so much better on the oled (60:51 - 60:55)
it's incredible that (60:53 - 60:59)
i should hope so but i have like (60:55 - 61:01)
i don't have a problem with how the (60:59 - 61:04)
world (61:01 - 61:04)
looks (61:04 - 61:06)
stylized like i like the trees i think (61:05 - 61:08)
the trees are interesting i like the (61:06 - 61:10)
water i think the water in most areas (61:08 - 61:12)
are interesting (61:10 - 61:15)
i what i hate is how it's lit (61:12 - 61:17)
and i hate how (61:15 - 61:18)
[Music] (61:17 - 61:20)
monochromatic they made the color (61:18 - 61:23)
choices in each area (61:20 - 61:25)
it (61:23 - 61:27)
it isn't (61:25 - 61:31)
visually interesting like (61:27 - 61:33)
in one area they're like what what would (61:31 - 61:35)
happen if we just took all the colors (61:33 - 61:37)
around brown (61:35 - 61:40)
and made everything but even there's (61:37 - 61:41)
just not enough (61:40 - 61:44)
nuance because yeah when you're doing (61:41 - 61:46)
the side quests that's like these three (61:44 - 61:49)
badoofs keep invading the village (61:46 - 61:51)
i at a certain point i was like i'm (61:49 - 61:53)
never gonna find that third badoof (61:51 - 61:55)
because the badoof color is the same (61:53 - 61:57)
color as the wood color (61:55 - 62:00)
and it all looks the same to me and my (61:57 - 62:02)
eyes just aren't that good i'm sorry (62:00 - 62:03)
yeah (62:02 - 62:05)
i think let's go pikachu let's go evie (62:03 - 62:08)
is a better looking game (62:05 - 62:09)
it (62:08 - 62:12)
it's a different style it is a brighter (62:09 - 62:15)
and more color rich game and i give you (62:12 - 62:16)
that (62:15 - 62:19)
for sure those are my two biggest knocks (62:16 - 62:21)
on this game is the color palette feels (62:19 - 62:25)
really weirdly muted and i don't know (62:21 - 62:27)
most of the time what the light is (62:25 - 62:29)
supposed to be doing i wanna i wanna (62:27 - 62:31)
caveat what steve said with one more (62:29 - 62:32)
thing before we get too far away from it (62:31 - 62:34)
uh like definitely i would recommend (62:32 - 62:36)
buying this game if you've got 60 (62:34 - 62:39)
dollars you love pokemon and you're over (62:36 - 62:42)
10 years old this is not a pokemon game (62:39 - 62:44)
for little kids because (62:42 - 62:47)
number one it's too complicated i don't (62:44 - 62:49)
think so i i think i think you know when (62:47 - 62:51)
i was when i was eight years old i beat (62:49 - 62:52)
ocarina of time congratulations i had (62:51 - 62:54)
the players i had a player's guide the (62:52 - 62:56)
entire time when i did it i don't think (62:54 - 62:58)
that's i don't think it was knock but i (62:56 - 62:59)
i think (62:58 - 63:00)
i think kids playing fortnite or breath (62:59 - 63:02)
of the wild i think they can play this (63:00 - 63:03)
but (63:02 - 63:05)
kids under 10 shouldn't be playing (63:03 - 63:08)
fortnite either but (63:05 - 63:09)
i i think (63:08 - 63:11)
because with a regular (63:09 - 63:14)
traditional pokemon title you can brute (63:11 - 63:17)
force your way through that game (63:14 - 63:19)
this you're going to have a lot you're (63:17 - 63:21)
going to just lose interest because it's (63:19 - 63:23)
just the complexity is too hard and the (63:21 - 63:26)
other thing is minecraft and they (63:23 - 63:29)
shouldn't yeah minecraft is whatever but (63:26 - 63:30)
the other thing is that i think this (63:29 - 63:33)
game exposes (63:30 - 63:36)
what the manga readers will say has been (63:33 - 63:38)
there the whole time but like the (63:36 - 63:40)
violence of the pokemon world (63:38 - 63:43)
in a way that other games never have (63:40 - 63:46)
because they are literally like (63:43 - 63:47)
if you don't do this (63:46 - 63:50)
you're gonna die yeah and you know what (63:47 - 63:52)
if you if you can't if you don't hold up (63:50 - 63:55)
we're not gonna take care of you like (63:52 - 63:57)
literally like celine literally says (63:55 - 63:59)
like if you become incapacitated and (63:57 - 64:03)
can't work we're throwing you out (63:59 - 64:04)
and it's like you're on your own i'm (64:03 - 64:06)
like but hey but i'm 15 years old no no (64:04 - 64:09)
hey i fell through a hole in the sky but (64:06 - 64:11)
it's like you know like pokedex entries (64:09 - 64:14)
sure have said yeah drift loon is trying (64:11 - 64:16)
to carry kids away (64:14 - 64:18)
in this game there is a drift loon that (64:16 - 64:21)
is literally trying to carry a kid away (64:18 - 64:23)
trying to murder that right in front of (64:21 - 64:25)
your face he literally tried to kill (64:23 - 64:29)
that kid i i (64:25 - 64:29)
yeah i think the game is worth 60 i (64:29 - 64:33)
think i think let's go pikachu let's go (64:31 - 64:35)
eevee i think the style they used in (64:33 - 64:39)
that game is fits the pokemon whatever (64:35 - 64:41)
characteristic vibe (64:39 - 64:43)
vibe i think it fits the vibe i think (64:41 - 64:44)
it's super colorful i think it's great (64:43 - 64:47)
to look at i think this game (64:44 - 64:49)
can be beautiful and is beautiful in (64:47 - 64:51)
moments i've seen cut scenes later on (64:49 - 64:53)
the game that are absolutely stunning (64:51 - 64:56)
and gorgeous there are i'd it is more (64:53 - 64:59)
impressive to me not that they've made a (64:56 - 65:02)
mediocre graphically like it's not mean (64:59 - 65:03)
it's not (65:02 - 65:05)
it's impressive to me that this game (65:03 - 65:07)
isn't like graphically mediocre (65:05 - 65:10)
graphically it is good and bad at the (65:07 - 65:11)
same time and that's what's impressive i (65:10 - 65:13)
don't know how they were able to do that (65:11 - 65:16)
like in one moment you're like (65:13 - 65:18)
this sunset is beautiful and then you (65:16 - 65:20)
turn slightly to the left and you see (65:18 - 65:23)
like three murkrows like barely flapping (65:20 - 65:25)
their wings like stuttering off at the (65:23 - 65:26)
distance like (65:25 - 65:29)
like and you're like (65:26 - 65:30)
the draw distance is better than i (65:29 - 65:32)
expected it to be (65:30 - 65:34)
but yeah also it's not great you should (65:32 - 65:36)
have it where like if pokemon cannot (65:34 - 65:37)
renter (65:36 - 65:40)
wing flapping more than three frames (65:37 - 65:41)
just make them disappear like because it (65:40 - 65:45)
looks terrible yeah there are also (65:41 - 65:47)
parts of the clothing (65:45 - 65:50)
and i i hate this example and like (65:47 - 65:52)
multiple people brought it up of like (65:50 - 65:55)
when like the commando commando what's (65:52 - 65:58)
his name captain commando kamado (65:55 - 66:00)
come on yeah that's (65:58 - 66:02)
that guy (66:00 - 66:04)
he is a main character in the game you (66:02 - 66:07)
are looking at his face quite often (66:04 - 66:10)
and when you look at his the top part of (66:07 - 66:12)
his kimono i think it is (66:10 - 66:16)
it is so pixelated and bad and and the (66:12 - 66:18)
the response i get is oh it's just a (66:16 - 66:21)
style they're doing no because look at (66:18 - 66:23)
the bottom of this kimono it is (66:21 - 66:27)
incredibly detailed and rich (66:23 - 66:29)
like there are just parts of these (66:27 - 66:31)
outfits when you're looking at these (66:29 - 66:33)
characters that are so pixelated and (66:31 - 66:36)
awful and then other parts of the game (66:33 - 66:38)
are gorgeous i don't think it's like an (66:36 - 66:39)
aesthetic thing that they're trying to (66:38 - 66:41)
make it look like old stitching (66:39 - 66:43)
literally the bottom of this kimono is (66:41 - 66:45)
incredibly detailed in every cut scene (66:43 - 66:48)
but the top is super pixelated i think (66:45 - 66:50)
that there's some weird texture thing (66:48 - 66:51)
happening (66:50 - 66:53)
where (66:51 - 66:55)
some of the textures just look really (66:53 - 66:57)
bad or they're not popping in or they're (66:55 - 66:59)
they're getting held back it there's (66:57 - 67:02)
parts it just looks awful some of it (66:59 - 67:04)
some of it i blame on the lighting (67:02 - 67:06)
choices (67:04 - 67:08)
like i sometimes don't think it's the (67:06 - 67:12)
model texture i think it's how the light (67:08 - 67:16)
interacts with the object is so (67:12 - 67:16)
weird that it makes (67:16 - 67:20)
things (67:19 - 67:22)
pixelated and i've noticed this a lot of (67:20 - 67:25)
times that the way they chose to do (67:22 - 67:27)
light (67:25 - 67:30)
makes things look worse and he is an (67:27 - 67:32)
example because if you look at him in (67:30 - 67:34)
other areas (67:32 - 67:36)
where the parts that are (67:34 - 67:38)
brightly lit look (67:36 - 67:39)
awful (67:38 - 67:42)
and as you go down where it's darker and (67:39 - 67:44)
it's normal shading they look great i (67:42 - 67:46)
think they completely (67:44 - 67:49)
messed up the lighting in this game and (67:46 - 67:51)
it makes me upset every time i'm like (67:49 - 67:53)
can i just go at night when you're not (67:51 - 67:55)
trying to do light (67:53 - 67:57)
because everything looks great at night (67:55 - 68:00)
when you do light it is (67:57 - 68:01)
awful (68:00 - 68:04)
also i am mistaking my claim (68:01 - 68:06)
here and now (68:04 - 68:06)
that (68:06 - 68:11)
adamant is my (68:08 - 68:11)
ruined the name volo for me and i don't (68:21 - 68:26)
trust oh i'm glad i have the same (68:24 - 68:27)
thought every time i see him i think (68:26 - 68:30)
soul calibur yeah and i think you are (68:27 - 68:33)
untrustworthy so um i wait before uh i (68:30 - 68:35)
would say that i'm probably (68:33 - 68:39)
my my stevens is uh rather than not (68:35 - 68:42)
reading the the text of the game i don't (68:39 - 68:45)
pay that much attention to the graphics (68:42 - 68:47)
i have literally not noticed any (68:45 - 68:49)
pictures i did i did have a person go (68:47 - 68:50)
like why do you care so much about the (68:49 - 68:51)
graphics (68:50 - 68:53)
and (68:51 - 68:54)
like (68:53 - 68:57)
look i put 2000 hours in sun and moon (68:54 - 68:58)
that game looks like booty because it's (68:57 - 69:00)
right it was running on a 10 year old (68:58 - 69:02)
3ds like it doesn't look great game game (69:00 - 69:04)
freak had very (69:02 - 69:07)
actual hardware limits on on that device (69:04 - 69:09)
as we saw in ultra sun and moon where (69:07 - 69:11)
the game got really frame ratey and (69:09 - 69:13)
chunky and stuff (69:11 - 69:17)
um i i think that like (69:13 - 69:17)
graphics are important not to everyone (69:17 - 69:21)
but to some people (69:19 - 69:25)
and like i am not personally a fan (69:21 - 69:27)
of this common thing that's been (69:25 - 69:29)
happening for the last like five years (69:27 - 69:31)
which is like let's make all our indie (69:29 - 69:32)
games as like super nintendo games (69:31 - 69:34)
because the cost is cheaper but they (69:32 - 69:36)
like yeah i get it super nintendo games (69:34 - 69:39)
they look a specific way they they age a (69:36 - 69:41)
specific way for the most part it looks (69:39 - 69:45)
good but graphically i'm just so over (69:41 - 69:48)
that style and your game has to be (69:45 - 69:51)
really good for me to get over that like (69:48 - 69:53)
let's do the super nintendo style and (69:51 - 69:56)
like stardew valley passes that test (69:53 - 69:57)
like it is one of those games where it's (69:56 - 70:00)
like it's so good that i do not care (69:57 - 70:03)
that it's it's super nintendo graphics i (70:00 - 70:06)
think that legends is so good that it (70:03 - 70:08)
gets past (70:06 - 70:11)
looking very mediocre in places (70:08 - 70:13)
again we know they can do good graphics (70:11 - 70:16)
they did let's go pikachu let's go eevee (70:13 - 70:18)
and for the most part i think sword and (70:16 - 70:20)
shield looks great i don't think that (70:18 - 70:22)
hey after you've done let's go after (70:20 - 70:24)
you've done sword and shield heck let's (70:22 - 70:26)
talk about a really good pokemon game (70:24 - 70:29)
pokemon snap that game is incredible so (70:26 - 70:31)
don't come to me and be like oh the (70:29 - 70:33)
graphics are just fine (70:31 - 70:37)
yeah they are just fine but we have seen (70:33 - 70:39)
good pokemon games specifically good (70:37 - 70:41)
pokemon graphics in pokemon snap and (70:39 - 70:44)
it's like i would like that in legends (70:41 - 70:47)
is it a deal breaker no of course not (70:44 - 70:49)
it's not because the gameplay does make (70:47 - 70:50)
up for the graphics but that doesn't (70:49 - 70:51)
mean we shouldn't be asking for good (70:50 - 70:53)
graphics and the graphics alone will (70:51 - 70:57)
push some people away where i think (70:53 - 71:00)
for let's go i think because of how (70:57 - 71:02)
great that game looked it did draw (71:00 - 71:04)
people in (71:02 - 71:07)
i i mean i think it's hard to (71:04 - 71:09)
it's hard to distinguish when because (71:07 - 71:12)
people still use graphics as a blanket (71:09 - 71:13)
term (71:12 - 71:15)
and it covers a lot of things and i (71:13 - 71:18)
think where this game (71:15 - 71:20)
falls down is the color choices they (71:18 - 71:22)
made (71:20 - 71:24)
and the lighting choices that they made (71:22 - 71:28)
and i think those two things (71:24 - 71:28)
ruin (71:28 - 71:32)
a lot of (71:29 - 71:34)
vistas that could be really stellar (71:32 - 71:37)
they it (71:34 - 71:37)
eve like we we are used to at this point (71:37 - 71:43)
draw a distance like we understand like (71:40 - 71:45)
if you played any online game things (71:43 - 71:48)
will suddenly phase in and act janky (71:45 - 71:50)
until you get close to them like that is (71:48 - 71:50)
just (71:50 - 71:53)
rendering and your graphics engines will (71:50 - 71:55)
render things differently whatever (71:53 - 71:57)
but the deliberate choices of how they (71:55 - 72:00)
did lighting and how they did colors (71:57 - 72:02)
they did a disservice to this game i (72:00 - 72:06)
think because it really makes (72:02 - 72:09)
the game (72:06 - 72:09)
in certain areas it's hard to play (72:10 - 72:14)
because i'm like i can't see (72:12 - 72:18)
like i'm looking at 15 shadowy blobs and (72:14 - 72:19)
none of it (72:18 - 72:21)
none of it's lit correctly and i don't (72:19 - 72:22)
know what i'm looking at and i don't (72:21 - 72:24)
know what i should be seeing i think (72:22 - 72:25)
greg is right with the lighting because (72:24 - 72:28)
one of the best the the easiest way i (72:25 - 72:30)
think for somebody listening to the show (72:28 - 72:31)
to see how good the game can graphically (72:30 - 72:34)
look is actually in a distortion (72:31 - 72:36)
because it's dark (72:34 - 72:37)
and (72:36 - 72:39)
how the distortion is laid out is (72:37 - 72:41)
actually really cool yeah (72:39 - 72:43)
it like the distortions always look (72:41 - 72:44)
great (72:43 - 72:46)
yeah um (72:44 - 72:48)
they they did something and i said that (72:46 - 72:49)
to brighton he's like yeah i don't know (72:48 - 72:51)
what they did to the light or what the (72:49 - 72:53)
light's even supposed to be doing most (72:51 - 72:54)
of the time in this game because it just (72:53 - 72:57)
looks weird all the time (72:54 - 73:00)
uh the other thing i want to shift to uh (72:57 - 73:02)
is the thing i like about the game the (73:00 - 73:04)
most and this was the frustrating thing (73:02 - 73:06)
for me in trailers and (73:04 - 73:08)
even i mean like obviously if you've (73:06 - 73:10)
been listening the show for the past (73:08 - 73:12)
year you've probably heard me being very (73:10 - 73:14)
hesitant about (73:12 - 73:17)
being overly excited for this game i (73:14 - 73:19)
dreaded playing this game the entire (73:17 - 73:23)
week before i got it and and it is you (73:19 - 73:24)
know for the most part they didn't use (73:23 - 73:26)
the word open world it's not an open (73:24 - 73:27)
world game you can't really go anywhere (73:26 - 73:28)
you want it's broken into five areas (73:27 - 73:30)
it's very monster honorary in that in (73:28 - 73:32)
that aspect that was never like the (73:30 - 73:34)
concern to me of like oh if it's not (73:32 - 73:35)
open world it's gonna be bad um the (73:34 - 73:38)
concern to me was that the these open (73:35 - 73:40)
worlds would feel empty and they (73:38 - 73:42)
wouldn't feel things to do (73:40 - 73:44)
and it would be very tedious and grindy (73:42 - 73:46)
if your goal was to complete the pokedex (73:44 - 73:48)
the thing that they spoiled for me which (73:46 - 73:50)
we talked about last week was entering (73:48 - 73:52)
and exiting a battle (73:50 - 73:54)
and the people would be like steve they (73:52 - 73:56)
did show exiting and entering a battle (73:54 - 73:57)
and i was like no (73:56 - 74:00)
it's not the the process of entering and (73:57 - 74:02)
exiting a battle it's like (74:00 - 74:05)
what you can do like you're like the (74:02 - 74:08)
fluidity how fluid is this game that is (74:05 - 74:10)
what sold me and that's the thing they (74:08 - 74:11)
didn't show in the trailer in the (74:10 - 74:14)
trailer they didn't show (74:11 - 74:15)
like (74:14 - 74:18)
you see 3b doof and you're like pokeball (74:15 - 74:19)
to the face pokeball to the face (74:18 - 74:21)
pokeball to the face (74:19 - 74:24)
uh starly over here to mine this uh (74:21 - 74:26)
luxray over here to mine this that when (74:24 - 74:28)
we do broke out turn around real quick (74:26 - 74:30)
poke ball to the face again like the (74:28 - 74:32)
ability (74:30 - 74:32)
to (74:32 - 74:36)
mine gather resources catch pokemon (74:32 - 74:39)
quickly go into a battle defeat the (74:36 - 74:41)
pokemon while you're walking away (74:39 - 74:42)
getting experience you're entering (74:41 - 74:46)
another battle they never showed that in (74:42 - 74:47)
a trailer (74:46 - 74:50)
and that i think is what makes the game (74:47 - 74:53)
so special and so much fun to play and i (74:50 - 74:54)
think that's super important why it's (74:53 - 74:55)
worth the 60 (74:54 - 74:58)
if you couldn't do that i actually think (74:55 - 75:00)
this game would be very mediocre and (74:58 - 75:03)
actually not as fun as what all you know (75:00 - 75:04)
people are saying (75:03 - 75:06)
uh because (75:04 - 75:07)
if you just think about like brilliant (75:06 - 75:09)
diamond shining pearl (75:07 - 75:12)
game that came out two months ago (75:09 - 75:13)
and (75:12 - 75:15)
it is similar to mostly every pokemon (75:13 - 75:17)
game you enter the grass (75:15 - 75:20)
your trainer stops screen either goes (75:17 - 75:22)
white or black it goes (75:20 - 75:25)
pokemon slides in your your trainer (75:22 - 75:27)
slides in flashes to your trainer you (75:25 - 75:30)
throw a pokemon flashes to that pokemon (75:27 - 75:32)
flashes to this pokemon goes back to (75:30 - 75:33)
making sure that you're still watching (75:32 - 75:35)
flashes back to that pokemon health bars (75:33 - 75:38)
come in the abilities maybe trigger and (75:35 - 75:40)
then you can start the battle (75:38 - 75:43)
and then you knock it out it does its (75:40 - 75:45)
fainting animation your trainer gets all (75:43 - 75:48)
excited it pops up about the pokemon's (75:45 - 75:49)
like (75:48 - 75:51)
experience what would you want to name (75:49 - 75:53)
it you caught it what is it social (75:51 - 75:55)
security number here's its blood type (75:53 - 75:57)
it's going to pc14 hey did you remember (75:55 - 75:59)
to do your taxes and then like the (75:57 - 76:02)
battle is over like all of that happens (75:59 - 76:04)
in a traditional pokemon game it has (76:02 - 76:07)
never asked me to do my taxes (76:04 - 76:08)
i don't know what version you're playing (76:07 - 76:10)
yeah you're playing the wrong in this (76:08 - 76:11)
game (76:10 - 76:15)
i can impale the back of three b doof's (76:11 - 76:17)
booties (76:15 - 76:19)
and they're caught in the in the in the (76:17 - 76:22)
time of like 10 seconds and it is it is (76:19 - 76:25)
if if we go back to that if we if we (76:22 - 76:27)
lose this (76:25 - 76:28)
i don't know if i could ever actually (76:27 - 76:30)
play another pokemon game again i don't (76:28 - 76:32)
know if i can (76:30 - 76:36)
do the 45 seconds to catch one b doof (76:32 - 76:39)
versus the 10 seconds to catch three i (76:36 - 76:40)
don't know if i can actually go back (76:39 - 76:42)
because it's that fun (76:40 - 76:45)
that fluid that good you know what else (76:42 - 76:47)
they didn't show in the trailer (76:45 - 76:49)
throwing out a pokeball at a tree full (76:47 - 76:51)
of chesto berries because you forgot to (76:49 - 76:53)
hit x (76:51 - 76:55)
that's like (76:53 - 76:58)
all the time again so frustrating why is (76:55 - 77:00)
that the same button (76:58 - 77:01)
um (77:00 - 77:03)
even something getting on and off a (77:01 - 77:05)
weird deer or switching to another (77:03 - 77:07)
pokemon that you can possibly unlock (77:05 - 77:10)
incredibly fluid this is the i think (77:07 - 77:12)
this is the thing the game does (77:10 - 77:13)
incredibly well (77:12 - 77:15)
is just (77:13 - 77:18)
well like the movement the exploring the (77:15 - 77:21)
like giving you choices and not feeling (77:18 - 77:25)
like i need to battle now i need to then (77:21 - 77:28)
mine now it's you can like do everything (77:25 - 77:32)
the catching to battling (77:28 - 77:33)
how that (77:32 - 77:36)
how you control that is so fluid in this (77:33 - 77:39)
game and it's what i want (77:36 - 77:40)
games to be going forward because it (77:39 - 77:42)
feels (77:40 - 77:45)
so real and so natural (77:42 - 77:47)
and (77:45 - 77:49)
i (77:47 - 77:49)
do not want to give up (77:50 - 77:56)
the ability to go into a menu and choose (77:52 - 77:57)
my moves (77:56 - 77:58)
and (77:57 - 78:00)
have (77:58 - 78:02)
the option that they don't evolve and i (78:00 - 78:05)
have to hit b i have to go into a menu (78:02 - 78:08)
and say okay you get to evolve now you (78:05 - 78:11)
get to evolve now because it's it it it (78:08 - 78:13)
it is my choice i don't have to (78:11 - 78:17)
interrupt something i don't have to (78:13 - 78:18)
at the end of a battle if it happened to (78:17 - 78:20)
pick up a new move go (78:18 - 78:22)
oh do i want flamethrower what am i (78:20 - 78:23)
going to get rid of and i'm forced to (78:22 - 78:25)
have that decision (78:23 - 78:27)
there it is (78:25 - 78:29)
blissfully (78:27 - 78:31)
i didn't even know i wanted it but (78:29 - 78:33)
blissfully (78:31 - 78:35)
away from my real-time experience and i (78:33 - 78:38)
can sit down and have a conversation (78:35 - 78:40)
with my pokemon what moves do you want (78:38 - 78:42)
today (78:40 - 78:44)
so i and i will i will definitely agree (78:42 - 78:47)
i one thing i love about the fluidity (78:44 - 78:49)
when especially when you're like in a (78:47 - 78:52)
battle scenario is the fact that if i (78:49 - 78:54)
want like if i've been battling and i (78:52 - 78:57)
want to throw a pokeball i just hit x (78:54 - 78:59)
select the pokeball i want to pick and (78:57 - 78:59)
then (78:59 - 79:00)
throw it (78:59 - 79:03)
or if i want to change the pokemon i (79:00 - 79:05)
just you know toggle to that i don't (79:03 - 79:08)
have to go into a menu to select a (79:05 - 79:10)
different and do the swap and everything (79:08 - 79:12)
i do like that you can do both though (79:10 - 79:16)
the yeah but yeah contrary (79:12 - 79:18)
a quality of life that they took away (79:16 - 79:20)
and you know i don't i don't find a lot (79:18 - 79:21)
of things to complain about but this is (79:20 - 79:24)
a stick in my craw (79:21 - 79:26)
you cannot go into your satchel (79:24 - 79:29)
select a pokemon and from a menu say (79:26 - 79:31)
restore (79:29 - 79:34)
you have to pick the item first and then (79:31 - 79:37)
pick the pokemon (79:34 - 79:37)
[Music] (79:42 - 79:50)
ten years i've been just hitting restore (79:45 - 79:50)
um so i thought with the battle system (79:50 - 79:55)
you know the the no held items didn't (79:53 - 79:57)
bother me no abilities didn't bother me (79:55 - 79:59)
same in let's go not that big of a deal (79:57 - 80:01)
there's no competitive scene i don't (79:59 - 80:02)
need to worry about geodude having (80:01 - 80:06)
sturdy whatever like it's fine (80:02 - 80:07)
um (80:06 - 80:09)
it was and it's not the agile uh strong (80:07 - 80:11)
style i do agree with what greg said (80:09 - 80:13)
earlier i think it's kind of like (80:11 - 80:15)
lackluster i like just i i'm probably (80:13 - 80:17)
not gonna one-shot this i'm gonna strong (80:15 - 80:19)
style now i'm gonna one shot it cool (80:17 - 80:22)
that's really what it comes down to the (80:19 - 80:24)
i think the thing about the battling is (80:22 - 80:28)
i it's just so uninteresting like they (80:24 - 80:31)
like forgot about it i am (80:28 - 80:33)
two (80:31 - 80:34)
nobles in (80:33 - 80:36)
i have not changed a single move on a (80:34 - 80:39)
single pokemon i just (80:36 - 80:41)
it doesn't matter it literally doesn't (80:39 - 80:42)
like and i think that's the thing i was (80:41 - 80:45)
thinking about is (80:42 - 80:47)
because you've only battled at this (80:45 - 80:50)
point seven trainers and each trainer (80:47 - 80:52)
with the exception of one has one (80:50 - 80:53)
pokemon there's a trainer that has two (80:52 - 80:55)
pokemons (80:53 - 80:57)
the after cleaver (80:55 - 80:59)
boys get a second pokemon and you battle (80:57 - 81:02)
them again um (80:59 - 81:05)
it it like (81:02 - 81:05)
i i i'm lost for words it's it's just (81:05 - 81:10)
trainer battles or wild pokemon battles (81:08 - 81:12)
both like okay i i can't agree with you (81:10 - 81:15)
there because that's that's something (81:12 - 81:17)
that may be informed just because you (81:15 - 81:20)
have more knowledge and experience (81:17 - 81:23)
in my battles be that i have more (81:20 - 81:25)
knowledge and experience of like moves (81:23 - 81:29)
and type weaknesses yeah (81:25 - 81:29)
more often than you would expect like i (81:31 - 81:35)
caught uh an alpha parasect and it knew (81:33 - 81:37)
a grass move a poison move slash and (81:35 - 81:39)
spore and the main reason i keep him is (81:37 - 81:40)
because he has spore (81:39 - 81:43)
um and but like (81:40 - 81:45)
parasect is grass poison i got the grass (81:43 - 81:47)
stab i got the poison stab the poison is (81:45 - 81:49)
venoshock they changed venoshock in this (81:47 - 81:51)
game in past games venoshock is if the (81:49 - 81:53)
pokemon is poison venoshock does double (81:51 - 81:54)
in this game it says if the pokemon is a (81:53 - 81:56)
status condition it does double yeah (81:54 - 81:58)
perfect i have spore why would i change (81:56 - 82:00)
that move and i have slash because slash (81:58 - 82:03)
is a neutral critical hit move like it (82:00 - 82:05)
has been the same for 20 hours i have (82:03 - 82:07)
zero desire to change its moves my like (82:05 - 82:09)
i just (82:07 - 82:11)
the moves that are on the pokemon just (82:09 - 82:13)
seem (82:11 - 82:16)
good enough and i don't need like (82:13 - 82:18)
coverage in my opinion because it kind (82:16 - 82:19)
of goes back to like (82:18 - 82:21)
well (82:19 - 82:24)
i'm going to go catch this alpha (82:21 - 82:25)
me i'm going to catch this alpha vespa (82:24 - 82:29)
quinn so i'm not going to bring pokemon (82:25 - 82:30)
weak to bug or flying because that's (82:29 - 82:32)
what vespa coin is so i'm just going to (82:30 - 82:34)
swap out some pokemon that are (82:32 - 82:35)
equivalent to that level (82:34 - 82:37)
and then i'm just going to get her and (82:35 - 82:38)
she's probably gonna kill three of my (82:37 - 82:40)
pokemon that's fine i'm going to catch (82:38 - 82:42)
her and then go back and cash her in why (82:40 - 82:44)
are you so comfortable with your pokemon (82:42 - 82:47)
daddy yeah he's cruel that's why (82:44 - 82:51)
my problem with the battling is (82:47 - 82:52)
that (82:51 - 82:53)
i (82:52 - 82:57)
in my mind if i have a level 15 (82:53 - 82:58)
cyndaquil (82:57 - 83:02)
going against a level two starly (82:58 - 83:03)
i should just (83:02 - 83:06)
hit that starly and it's gone (83:03 - 83:10)
for some reason yeah yeah they (83:06 - 83:12)
the number one the lower level pokemon (83:10 - 83:15)
hit harder than i expected (83:12 - 83:16)
very hard (83:15 - 83:17)
and (83:16 - 83:19)
and i'm having like my cynical i was (83:17 - 83:22)
like did i get just like a garbage roll (83:19 - 83:23)
of the dice here because this dude is (83:22 - 83:26)
getting knocked out left him (83:23 - 83:28)
yeah i did i did notice that and i'm not (83:26 - 83:32)
100 sure what's happening there and (83:28 - 83:34)
it's fine it's like interesting in a way (83:32 - 83:37)
that like you just can't one shot but i (83:34 - 83:39)
think like they did do a quality of life (83:37 - 83:41)
feature where where what greg said is (83:39 - 83:43)
you can just go in and start changing (83:41 - 83:45)
moves you can do that anywhere they give (83:43 - 83:47)
you like a mirror there's like miracle (83:45 - 83:49)
seeds where if you go to the the one (83:47 - 83:52)
person in the jubilife (83:49 - 83:53)
they'll (83:52 - 83:55)
like master a move oh mastery seeds (83:53 - 83:57)
seeds of mastery except they don't (83:55 - 83:59)
explain that either and also the one (83:57 - 84:01)
move that i needed sandler to master it (83:59 - 84:03)
was because it was a stantler exclusive (84:01 - 84:06)
move you're refu she they refused to (84:03 - 84:08)
master it for you because (84:06 - 84:11)
for whatever literally no reason except (84:08 - 84:12)
that it's an exclusive move for stantler (84:11 - 84:14)
and you can't master it you have to do (84:12 - 84:15)
it by level up (84:14 - 84:17)
like (84:15 - 84:17)
i (84:17 - 84:20)
be the fact the po the point being is (84:17 - 84:23)
they made it so you can change your (84:20 - 84:26)
moves any time but the battling is so (84:23 - 84:28)
uninteresting that it doesn't even (84:26 - 84:29)
matter (84:28 - 84:31)
it's just (84:29 - 84:34)
it's just like and and they they changed (84:31 - 84:36)
it in a way too so for those that are (84:34 - 84:38)
unfamiliar with competitive battling (84:36 - 84:40)
which is totally fine (84:38 - 84:42)
in in brilliant diamond shining pearl (84:40 - 84:45)
the reason i was able to (84:42 - 84:48)
like not need any items or not need to (84:45 - 84:51)
revive during the elite four is because (84:48 - 84:52)
if i knew there was a pokemon in front (84:51 - 84:55)
of me that couldn't do any like here's a (84:52 - 84:56)
really good example (84:55 - 84:58)
my gastrodon pretty much destroyed the (84:56 - 85:00)
entire elite four the reason why is (84:58 - 85:01)
because as soon as the elite four sent (85:00 - 85:03)
out a physical pokemon as long as it (85:01 - 85:07)
wasn't grass i would use the move harden (85:03 - 85:08)
the the (85:07 - 85:10)
third episode of the anime hardened (85:08 - 85:13)
metapod i would use those (85:10 - 85:14)
and i would use it three times then i (85:13 - 85:16)
would use the move recover and then i (85:14 - 85:17)
would use harden three more times and (85:16 - 85:20)
now it was plus six (85:17 - 85:21)
defense (85:20 - 85:23)
and whatever they threw out at me (85:21 - 85:25)
couldn't touch me (85:23 - 85:27)
and that was the strategy i used (85:25 - 85:29)
fair strategy right hardin is in the (85:27 - 85:31)
game recover is in the game i didn't use (85:29 - 85:32)
any held items i didn't use any x (85:31 - 85:34)
attacks i didn't use any xspeeds i just (85:32 - 85:37)
hardened recovered attacked (85:34 - 85:40)
in this game you can't do that you can (85:37 - 85:42)
use harden once (85:40 - 85:44)
and that's it (85:42 - 85:46)
you can't use you can use harden again (85:44 - 85:48)
but it's not going to do anything (85:46 - 85:51)
that you just use it once and you're (85:48 - 85:52)
done (85:51 - 85:53)
and (85:52 - 85:57)
why was that a choice why like like not (85:53 - 85:59)
only are you not doing enough battles to (85:57 - 86:04)
make that like really relevant even like (85:59 - 86:06)
i'm not exaggerating i've battled seven (86:04 - 86:07)
trainers (86:06 - 86:09)
and (86:07 - 86:10)
three battles have been against the (86:09 - 86:12)
rival two battles have been against (86:10 - 86:15)
volvo or whatever his name volo (86:12 - 86:15)
like you would never do that i guess you (86:15 - 86:20)
could swords dance twice but why it's (86:17 - 86:21)
just (86:20 - 86:22)
they have one pokemon (86:21 - 86:24)
and it's the same for wild battles you (86:22 - 86:27)
could sword stands twice but (86:24 - 86:30)
but why they it's just one battle so why (86:27 - 86:33)
go through the the effort of like over (86:30 - 86:35)
simplifying that (86:33 - 86:38)
when the thing that you would like the (86:35 - 86:39)
reason you swords dance in front of (86:38 - 86:42)
somebody is because you're predicting or (86:39 - 86:44)
because you're setting up but if it's (86:42 - 86:46)
only 1v1 (86:44 - 86:48)
there's not a huge reason to do that (86:46 - 86:51)
have you run into double battles yet no (86:48 - 86:53)
well i mean i had three zubats attack me (86:51 - 86:55)
yeah but again you wouldn't you wouldn't (86:53 - 86:57)
want to sword dance there because you're (86:55 - 86:58)
you're gonna be you're putting yourself (86:57 - 87:00)
at a disadvantage that's the whole point (86:58 - 87:03)
of like the swords dance or the harden (87:00 - 87:04)
is because you're kind of like setting (87:03 - 87:06)
up slash predicting if you got three (87:04 - 87:08)
zubats there probably a bad time to (87:06 - 87:09)
predict a sword (87:08 - 87:12)
yep (87:09 - 87:12)
i i feel like they wanted the agile and (87:12 - 87:19)
strong style to play (87:15 - 87:22)
a bigger role and i'm just not (87:19 - 87:23)
seeing it (87:22 - 87:25)
um i do think (87:23 - 87:28)
i do change up moves um (87:25 - 87:30)
quite a bit partly because (87:28 - 87:31)
suddenly there's new entries in the (87:30 - 87:33)
pokedex that i have to (87:31 - 87:35)
deal with because oh they figured out (87:33 - 87:37)
this move so now you have to see it 20 (87:35 - 87:39)
times (87:37 - 87:41)
um or even i just want to see the (87:39 - 87:43)
animation for that move because the move (87:41 - 87:45)
animations look real cool they look good (87:43 - 87:47)
they (87:45 - 87:48)
um (87:47 - 87:50)
and i do think there are reasons to (87:48 - 87:52)
change moves i i'm not saying there (87:50 - 87:54)
there's not just i don't think it's as (87:52 - 87:56)
important (87:54 - 87:59)
in this game (87:56 - 88:02)
as it will be if they keep this mechanic (87:59 - 88:05)
in future games yeah and i i do feel (88:02 - 88:08)
like arceus is (88:05 - 88:08)
the test (88:08 - 88:11)
i hate this every pokemon game is doing (88:12 - 88:15)
something new (88:14 - 88:18)
no i i it does do something new but i do (88:15 - 88:21)
think there are a lot of ideas that a (88:18 - 88:23)
lot of people have (88:21 - 88:24)
said (88:23 - 88:26)
you should do this and this game (88:24 - 88:28)
was what they included and what they (88:26 - 88:31)
took away i feel like it was i i feel (88:28 - 88:32)
more than any other game that's done (88:31 - 88:34)
something new (88:32 - 88:37)
that this is a test of a new (88:34 - 88:38)
direction (88:37 - 88:40)
let's go pikachu let's literally put (88:38 - 88:42)
pokemon in the wild like i didn't wear (88:40 - 88:43)
it like it worked that's sword and (88:42 - 88:45)
shield has three wild areas that are (88:43 - 88:47)
very like (88:45 - 88:49)
like i i don't like when people are like (88:47 - 88:50)
they're all this is theirs this is maybe (88:49 - 88:52)
the game where they're testing it's like (88:50 - 88:53)
no they've been tested like they've been (88:52 - 88:55)
doing all of this stuff (88:53 - 88:57)
yeah they tested all those things in (88:55 - 88:59)
those games (88:57 - 89:02)
well how is that hard battle system (88:59 - 89:05)
they've achieved because it's awful (89:02 - 89:05)
yeah (89:06 - 89:09)
but i think (89:08 - 89:11)
i i think going along with what greg is (89:09 - 89:13)
saying i would say the the strong and (89:11 - 89:17)
agile is either a further a development (89:13 - 89:18)
of isle of armor (89:17 - 89:20)
right because you had your you chose (89:18 - 89:21)
your hershey food and it had a battle (89:20 - 89:25)
style and it even became a tcg or (89:21 - 89:28)
it's the foundation for (89:25 - 89:29)
the next (89:28 - 89:31)
way you know or well i mean it's (89:29 - 89:32)
honestly it's (89:31 - 89:34)
mega z moves (89:32 - 89:38)
gigantomax you know okay i would i would (89:34 - 89:40)
wager to bet they they simplified it for (89:38 - 89:42)
the sake of simplifying it (89:40 - 89:44)
um and (89:42 - 89:47)
for people like there are so many like i (89:44 - 89:49)
learned this from dynamics adventure (89:47 - 89:51)
like people listening to the show (89:49 - 89:53)
probably have a pretty good (89:51 - 89:55)
grasp of type effectiveness and what (89:53 - 89:58)
moves do and why you would use (89:55 - 89:59)
string shot (89:58 - 90:01)
right like string shot's actually like a (89:59 - 90:03)
decent move (90:01 - 90:04)
sorry surprise it is especially in (90:03 - 90:07)
double battles um (90:04 - 90:10)
and i i get why they would simplify it (90:07 - 90:11)
in the sense of like (90:10 - 90:13)
hey you know we're not really focused on (90:11 - 90:16)
battles mostly worry about the catching (90:13 - 90:17)
but if you do (90:16 - 90:19)
but in my head (90:17 - 90:22)
i i don't think (90:19 - 90:25)
simplifying something like swords dance (90:22 - 90:27)
is beneficial to a (90:25 - 90:29)
if we're going back to what sword stance (90:27 - 90:31)
should be in a future game and i i don't (90:29 - 90:34)
see them being like the plus six minus (90:31 - 90:36)
six (90:34 - 90:37)
status condition (90:36 - 90:40)
i don't see that going away (90:37 - 90:42)
because even because even changing (90:40 - 90:44)
something like tailwind which they did (90:42 - 90:45)
do they did a minor change to tailwind (90:44 - 90:47)
well not minor change but they did a (90:45 - 90:49)
pretty big change from tailwind from (90:47 - 90:53)
gen 7 to gen 8. changed how you set up (90:49 - 90:55)
the matches and it changed it in a good (90:53 - 90:57)
way i don't think these changes are good (90:55 - 90:59)
i think they're simple and i think (90:57 - 91:01)
i don't think i i don't think a lot of (90:59 - 91:04)
the changes are good i am struggling (91:01 - 91:07)
with understanding (91:04 - 91:10)
paralysis versus drowsy at this point (91:07 - 91:11)
because (91:10 - 91:14)
in the game functionally they seem to do (91:11 - 91:18)
the exact same thing um (91:14 - 91:20)
i i just (91:18 - 91:22)
they they change in a way where it's (91:20 - 91:24)
just so uninteresting (91:22 - 91:27)
uh and i don't know if it's because (91:24 - 91:28)
i don't even mind that there's a lack of (91:27 - 91:30)
trainer battles i mean we talked about (91:28 - 91:32)
this for the last year it doesn't look (91:30 - 91:33)
like they're trainer battles in this (91:32 - 91:34)
game there's (91:33 - 91:37)
there there's not i mean i mean they are (91:34 - 91:38)
but i don't think the ones that they're (91:37 - 91:40)
in i don't think are worth it (91:38 - 91:44)
no yeah they feel real shoehorned in (91:40 - 91:45)
and (91:44 - 91:46)
this is going to lead to my second (91:45 - 91:48)
complaint (91:46 - 91:50)
holy cow are the noble battles the worst (91:48 - 91:53)
part of this entire game (91:50 - 91:54)
they are (91:53 - 91:57)
they like i will i i'm i'm i will get on (91:54 - 91:59)
my soapbox i am always happy when game (91:57 - 92:01)
freak or whatever company tries (91:59 - 92:03)
something new (92:01 - 92:05)
do it try it see if it works if it (92:03 - 92:06)
doesn't (92:05 - 92:08)
no big deal you're gonna be making poke (92:06 - 92:09)
you're gonna be making pokemon games for (92:08 - 92:11)
the next 25 50 years you'll be able to (92:09 - 92:12)
change it (92:11 - 92:13)
but (92:12 - 92:15)
in a game with (92:13 - 92:18)
you battle four people before you get to (92:15 - 92:20)
cleaver maybe five (92:18 - 92:22)
you are you are (92:20 - 92:25)
forming a team of six pokemon by (92:22 - 92:27)
catching and battling (92:25 - 92:31)
wild pokemon three zubats at once 17 (92:27 - 92:33)
foot tall rapidashes you are battling (92:31 - 92:34)
these pokemon to get to what is (92:33 - 92:37)
ultimately a boss battle a battle of (92:34 - 92:40)
wits and strength and you for five (92:37 - 92:43)
minutes throw ramen packets (92:40 - 92:46)
at cleaver and the battle is over and (92:43 - 92:47)
that is it (92:46 - 92:50)
why am i building it (92:47 - 92:50)
it actually makes cleaver harder to use (92:51 - 92:56)
your pokemon (92:54 - 92:59)
it slows down the battle (92:56 - 93:01)
in a way where you're like why am i even (92:59 - 93:03)
doing this i it would have been faster (93:01 - 93:04)
for me to continue throwing ramen (93:03 - 93:06)
packets around the corner (93:04 - 93:08)
like it is and (93:06 - 93:11)
the second noble which i will not spoil (93:08 - 93:12)
who that is (93:11 - 93:14)
it is the same thing (93:12 - 93:18)
except there's no tree to hide behind (93:14 - 93:19)
and (93:18 - 93:21)
i was like maybe the second noble battle (93:19 - 93:23)
will (93:21 - 93:23)
got the the second noble to the (93:35 - 93:40)
75 percent it said (93:38 - 93:42)
they are (93:40 - 93:44)
stunned throughout your pokemon and i (93:42 - 93:46)
was like okay and i went to do that and (93:44 - 93:48)
then they were no longer stunned you (93:46 - 93:50)
gotta get it out quick yeah it is a (93:48 - 93:52)
sharp window (93:50 - 93:54)
and the i'm not (93:52 - 93:56)
there's footage of this (93:54 - 93:57)
the entire rest of the battle they did (93:56 - 94:00)
not ask me to throw out my pokemon i (93:57 - 94:03)
ramen i ramen them from start to finish (94:00 - 94:04)
and (94:03 - 94:06)
and (94:04 - 94:09)
i asked myself why do i have a team of (94:06 - 94:12)
pokemon because but but also the thing (94:09 - 94:14)
that they didn't when they first showed (94:12 - 94:16)
like in the trailer the the throwing the (94:14 - 94:19)
packets at cleavor they left out (94:16 - 94:21)
that you you don't get to throw out your (94:19 - 94:24)
pokemon until it hits the tree (94:21 - 94:27)
that's what triggers for you to hit to (94:24 - 94:29)
throw at your pokemon well if you don't (94:27 - 94:31)
i know i know why you throw out your (94:29 - 94:33)
pokemon no no this is mathematically not (94:31 - 94:36)
the why why do i have a team (94:33 - 94:38)
well i mean (94:36 - 94:40)
i i lost a cleaver i don't know if you (94:38 - 94:42)
did but i clearly (94:40 - 94:43)
killed me (94:42 - 94:46)
and one thing i do greatly appreciate is (94:43 - 94:48)
that they gave you the option to either (94:46 - 94:50)
restart the battle completely from the (94:48 - 94:54)
beginning or from where you left off so (94:50 - 94:56)
they're basically acknowledging that hey (94:54 - 95:00)
this is a story point yeah not a (94:56 - 95:02)
accessibility concerns of like (95:00 - 95:04)
there are (95:02 - 95:06)
both the noble battles are very (95:04 - 95:09)
dexterity slash role (95:06 - 95:10)
dodge (95:09 - 95:11)
and (95:10 - 95:14)
you can't just pokemon battle them you (95:11 - 95:18)
have to aim and throw and roll and dodge (95:14 - 95:19)
um (95:18 - 95:22)
i mean i will say that (95:19 - 95:24)
the window for throwing your pokemon out (95:22 - 95:26)
is too short i don't think it's (95:24 - 95:28)
worthless because (95:26 - 95:29)
it's worthless to throw your pokemon (95:28 - 95:31)
don't do it it takes more time just keep (95:29 - 95:33)
throwing ramen it's faster it (95:31 - 95:38)
i don't i don't i mean time wise but (95:33 - 95:39)
the amount that is (95:38 - 95:42)
if you don't include them in the battle (95:39 - 95:44)
what does it matter you're not using (95:42 - 95:45)
them for the next noble battle you're (95:44 - 95:47)
going to throw more ramen at them i (95:45 - 95:49)
still gotta level up my pokemon (95:47 - 95:51)
i i i (95:49 - 95:54)
in all three it has been (95:51 - 95:56)
it has been worthwhile for me to battle (95:54 - 96:00)
because the bar goes down very far (95:56 - 96:03)
yeah oh it definitely accelerates it (96:00 - 96:06)
absolutely i i bet if if if you put side (96:03 - 96:07)
by side (96:06 - 96:10)
just ramening them and ramen pokemon (96:07 - 96:12)
ramen pokemon just ramening them was (96:10 - 96:13)
faster (96:12 - 96:16)
anything anything to get me out of the (96:13 - 96:19)
dodge cycle i am taking yes (96:16 - 96:20)
anything to get me out of the dodge (96:19 - 96:26)
cycle i am 100 taking that especially (96:20 - 96:27)
i (96:26 - 96:31)
the the the third one (96:27 - 96:31)
got me to an anger point (96:34 - 96:38)
that but (96:36 - 96:40)
that i rarely get to here's the thing (96:38 - 96:41)
though (96:40 - 96:44)
even if the ramen is faster than using a (96:41 - 96:47)
pokemon and even though like i'm still (96:44 - 96:49)
asking myself why do i have this team of (96:47 - 96:50)
pokemon if i'm not being able to like (96:49 - 96:53)
showcase them finally (96:50 - 96:55)
it's just not fun the ramen part is not (96:53 - 96:56)
fun (96:55 - 96:59)
like dodging around (96:56 - 97:01)
cleaver or dodging around the second (96:59 - 97:03)
noble (97:01 - 97:03)
it (97:04 - 97:07)
when you go from what i said earlier of (97:04 - 97:09)
like i can like whip poke balls at b (97:07 - 97:11)
dupes i can jump on a stantler i can (97:09 - 97:15)
jump over a snorlax i can go uh (97:11 - 97:16)
look at (97:15 - 97:18)
mine a bunch of farm a bunch of these (97:16 - 97:21)
trees and like (97:18 - 97:24)
peg the back of mr mime with a (97:21 - 97:26)
pokeball in the back of his head and (97:24 - 97:28)
it feels real good and so great and it (97:26 - 97:31)
shakes like the fluidity and the (97:28 - 97:32)
it's just fun (97:31 - 97:36)
it just feels good looks good (97:32 - 97:39)
everything about that is fun (97:36 - 97:41)
running around a tree (97:39 - 97:45)
throwing ramen packets at cleaver (97:41 - 97:48)
i think that is as fun as any dumb zelda (97:45 - 97:49)
boss (97:48 - 97:51)
where you just have to like learn the (97:49 - 97:52)
trick (97:51 - 97:55)
to get the boss yeah i i can see the (97:52 - 97:57)
comparison but it's just (97:55 - 98:00)
but the difference between zelda and you (97:57 - 98:04)
and this game is i i i've been training (98:00 - 98:06)
these six pokemon they're on my team (98:04 - 98:08)
i've been like leveling them up (98:06 - 98:10)
if i was one of you two i probably would (98:08 - 98:13)
have taught them new moves but and i (98:10 - 98:15)
don't really get to showcase them at all (98:13 - 98:16)
you are (98:15 - 98:18)
i think that one of the key things that (98:16 - 98:20)
sets this game apart that you're missing (98:18 - 98:22)
is is the you (98:20 - 98:27)
that you are it they are judging you you (98:22 - 98:29)
are part of it's not only it's it's not (98:27 - 98:32)
this weird world where you and i having (98:29 - 98:34)
a disagreement but our pokemon are gonna (98:32 - 98:36)
fight it out yeah i i don't know if this (98:34 - 98:37)
happened to you (98:36 - 98:41)
but i was in a regular pokemon battle (98:37 - 98:44)
and for some reason not paying attention (98:41 - 98:46)
walking around got between geodude and (98:44 - 98:49)
cyndaquil guess what geodude knocked me (98:46 - 98:50)
on my butt (98:49 - 98:53)
yeah i can get hit during a pokemon (98:50 - 98:55)
battle i think that is cool i definitely (98:53 - 98:57)
think that is cool that is what these (98:55 - 98:59)
noble battles are saying is you are in (98:57 - 99:02)
this world as well you have to (98:59 - 99:05)
be a functional partner it's not just (99:02 - 99:07)
your pokemon i think story-wise and (99:05 - 99:09)
thematically (99:07 - 99:11)
the (99:09 - 99:14)
noble pokemon battles are (99:11 - 99:19)
interesting i think however doing them (99:14 - 99:21)
grinds the game to a halt in (99:19 - 99:24)
in a way because i do agree that the (99:21 - 99:25)
whipping of (99:24 - 99:28)
ramen packets and the dexterity based (99:25 - 99:29)
jumping around (99:28 - 99:31)
uh (99:29 - 99:34)
is not super thrilling gameplay (99:31 - 99:36)
uh and i will say just for the people (99:34 - 99:38)
who don't watch my stream i had zero (99:36 - 99:41)
problems with both nobles like (99:38 - 99:43)
like the the second one hit me like (99:41 - 99:44)
twice (99:43 - 99:45)
while i was learning their pattern and (99:44 - 99:47)
then i figured it out and i was like (99:45 - 99:48)
you're not like i know how to dodge (99:47 - 99:50)
everything now and now it's just the (99:48 - 99:53)
ramen waiting game keep keep in mind you (99:50 - 99:56)
can do as much as you want (99:53 - 99:58)
before doing a noble pokemon it's not (99:56 - 100:02)
like i did everything stops until you do (99:58 - 100:03)
this (100:02 - 100:04)
yes there is (100:03 - 100:06)
here's the thing everything is more fun (100:04 - 100:08)
than doing that noble pokemon but that's (100:06 - 100:11)
fine it's a gate you do the game (100:08 - 100:14)
you get you get past the gate (100:11 - 100:16)
it is a it is uh (100:14 - 100:19)
it is equivalent to (100:16 - 100:20)
hey everything in between every gym (100:19 - 100:23)
leader is great the gym leaders are bad (100:20 - 100:24)
like (100:23 - 100:26)
gym leaders are good they are fun they (100:24 - 100:28)
sh they they they are something you (100:26 - 100:29)
prepare for there's something that like (100:28 - 100:32)
signifies that i'm done with this area (100:29 - 100:33)
they are something that like what are (100:32 - 100:36)
they gonna use who is their ace what is (100:33 - 100:37)
their dialogue (100:36 - 100:40)
like i i still remember the first time i (100:37 - 100:41)
entered (100:40 - 100:42)
uh (100:41 - 100:44)
clay's gym clay's not even that good of (100:42 - 100:46)
a gym leader but i remember entering (100:44 - 100:49)
clay's gym and going down and and doing (100:46 - 100:50)
the puzzle and like being like what (100:49 - 100:52)
pokemon do you have holy cow you have an (100:50 - 100:54)
exca drill like (100:52 - 100:57)
like i remember that and what am i going (100:54 - 100:59)
to remember from cleaver that i like (100:57 - 101:01)
stood behind a tree and he kept running (100:59 - 101:02)
into the tree over and over because he (101:01 - 101:03)
couldn't figure out how to get around (101:02 - 101:05)
the tree and i just ram the package like (101:03 - 101:06)
like (101:05 - 101:08)
it's (101:06 - 101:08)
again i'm glad they tried something new (101:10 - 101:15)
but the weakest part of your game is (101:13 - 101:18)
like the gym leader part of like the the (101:15 - 101:20)
the test of strength to move on to the (101:18 - 101:22)
next area like i (101:20 - 101:24)
it has been more (101:22 - 101:27)
i i got more of a thrill and i had more (101:24 - 101:30)
enjoyment trying to take down a level 40 (101:27 - 101:33)
parasect when i was level 25 (101:30 - 101:36)
and it i i he the parasite killed five (101:33 - 101:38)
of my pokemon (101:36 - 101:40)
all none of my pokemon were above level (101:38 - 101:42)
25 this parasite was 40. i had it (101:40 - 101:45)
paralyzed i and i i (101:42 - 101:48)
i was like i'm going to die here but i (101:45 - 101:49)
really want to catch this i threw a (101:48 - 101:51)
heavy ball it broke out it was fully (101:49 - 101:53)
paralyzed it gave me one more (101:51 - 101:54)
opportunity to throw another heavy ball (101:53 - 101:57)
because the parasite had like 2 hp and i (101:54 - 101:59)
caught it and it felt (101:57 - 102:02)
incredible to do that and i've heard (101:59 - 102:04)
that experience from other people where (102:02 - 102:07)
catching alpha pokemon (102:04 - 102:08)
feel (102:07 - 102:11)
just as good as catching a shiny pokemon (102:08 - 102:13)
and i think they've accomplished that (102:11 - 102:15)
and i think that they (102:13 - 102:17)
they figured it out i think that (102:15 - 102:19)
catching pokemon feels rewarding and (102:17 - 102:22)
feels good i think the alpha pokemon are (102:19 - 102:23)
a great (102:22 - 102:25)
balance of challenge and give you a (102:23 - 102:28)
reason to catch something and (102:25 - 102:30)
then you look at the nobles and you're (102:28 - 102:32)
like this is just a dodging puzzle (102:30 - 102:35)
like it just it seems like a disconnect (102:32 - 102:38)
out of what the rest of the game is and (102:35 - 102:40)
yeah there's only five of them (102:38 - 102:41)
but they're supposed to be like these (102:40 - 102:43)
big keystone moments in the game and (102:41 - 102:45)
they just fall flat (102:43 - 102:46)
i mean (102:45 - 102:50)
they are big keystone moments story-wise (102:46 - 102:51)
yeah but (102:50 - 102:53)
gameplay-wise (102:51 - 102:56)
things that i wish is i i thought there (102:53 - 102:58)
i thought there would be more chances to (102:56 - 103:01)
battle than there seemingly are (102:58 - 103:04)
uh so far in the ones that i've done the (103:01 - 103:06)
messages only popped up once (103:04 - 103:09)
which i'm like (103:06 - 103:15)
okay i i i wish i wish it was a bit like (103:09 - 103:17)
um (103:15 - 103:19)
max raid battle shields like you get to (103:17 - 103:21)
a certain level in the shield comes up i (103:19 - 103:23)
wish that was got to a certain level now (103:21 - 103:27)
you battle go back now you battle (103:23 - 103:30)
it's not and i (103:27 - 103:33)
i don't look forward to noble battles (103:30 - 103:36)
like i it is a dexterity based jumping (103:33 - 103:39)
figure out the pattern thing and the (103:36 - 103:41)
arenas get weird (103:39 - 103:42)
it's fine it it (103:41 - 103:46)
story wise i love them gameplay-wise i (103:42 - 103:49)
i i don't enjoy doing these things as a (103:46 - 103:52)
thing that i have to do in the game but (103:49 - 103:53)
going back to what steve said at the (103:52 - 103:55)
very beginning right (103:53 - 103:58)
the point of the game is to collect all (103:55 - 104:00)
the pokemon so that you get to meet (103:58 - 104:03)
arceus and hopefully he sends me home (104:00 - 104:06)
back to my comforts of the modern world (104:03 - 104:08)
arceus is the worst tinder date he just (104:06 - 104:10)
like you you swipe right get in (104:08 - 104:12)
but right the the nobel pokemon they are (104:10 - 104:15)
a starting point and they they they make (104:12 - 104:18)
it like not even a gate i mean just to (104:15 - 104:21)
be very clear for anybody who is afraid (104:18 - 104:24)
because of what people are saying (104:21 - 104:28)
you the the noble pokemon can kill you (104:24 - 104:30)
and you literally get the option of (104:28 - 104:32)
start where i left off so if you had (104:30 - 104:34)
thrown enough ramen packets to get it to (104:32 - 104:36)
like half rage (104:34 - 104:38)
you start up your full health again and (104:36 - 104:41)
it's at half rage so you just keep (104:38 - 104:43)
knocking it so it's like it it is a (104:41 - 104:45)
story oh if if they didn't do that (104:43 - 104:47)
people would quit the game correct well (104:45 - 104:49)
and it's like but so but it's not the (104:47 - 104:52)
key to like it's not right gameplay it's (104:49 - 104:55)
like this is what pearl clan cares about (104:52 - 104:56)
i (104:55 - 104:59)
i the only thing is i wish it was more (104:56 - 105:02)
exciting i wish there were more chances (104:59 - 105:04)
in the noble battles to actually battle (105:02 - 105:06)
with my pokemon than there are (105:04 - 105:09)
um (105:06 - 105:12)
i don't hate it i also don't love it i (105:09 - 105:16)
it is a it is a it is a boss battle (105:12 - 105:18)
mechanic that i just accept at like (105:16 - 105:20)
again they took the jrpg button and (105:18 - 105:23)
ranked it to 11 and this is (105:20 - 105:25)
this is a feeling it was like a a 10 (105:23 - 105:27)
year old boss battle that like yeah (105:25 - 105:29)
somebody played ocarina of time and was (105:27 - 105:31)
like let's put that like it just (105:29 - 105:34)
it just feels outdated too like (105:31 - 105:36)
it feels like a a mechanic that was that (105:34 - 105:39)
was very popular in old (105:36 - 105:42)
action rpgs that we have moved past by (105:39 - 105:46)
this by this point and i (105:42 - 105:48)
don't particularly love most action rpgs (105:46 - 105:50)
with the exception of like monster (105:48 - 105:50)
hunter (105:50 - 105:52)
um (105:50 - 105:55)
but yeah it it they're just (105:52 - 105:57)
they were they're a letdown (105:55 - 105:59)
i i don't think it's sour again at the (105:57 - 106:01)
start of this (105:59 - 106:04)
podcast this game is incredible (106:01 - 106:06)
like everything else makes up for it the (106:04 - 106:09)
the mediocre graphics and again i think (106:06 - 106:10)
the graphics look good in some places i (106:09 - 106:12)
think it falls incredibly flat in other (106:10 - 106:15)
places um i think the graphics are a bit (106:12 - 106:16)
of (106:15 - 106:19)
a bit of a bummer the sound is really (106:16 - 106:21)
good when it works sometimes like you (106:19 - 106:22)
just don't get music (106:21 - 106:23)
uh (106:22 - 106:25)
sometimes you don't get music for (106:23 - 106:29)
a lot of the game where i'm like (106:25 - 106:30)
i was in an area (106:29 - 106:33)
and music suddenly kicked on (106:30 - 106:36)
and i'm like what ha what (106:33 - 106:38)
this is the perfect game for steve since (106:36 - 106:39)
you always play with the sound turned (106:38 - 106:41)
off i was like well there's no sound (106:39 - 106:42)
harassing you a thousand hours into (106:41 - 106:44)
sword and shield i have never not played (106:42 - 106:45)
it with the sound (106:44 - 106:48)
you always complain about me playing (106:45 - 106:51)
with the sound on in my 3ds (106:48 - 106:52)
there are the but the thing is what i (106:51 - 106:56)
notice is when you go into stealth mode (106:52 - 106:59)
it quiets the music down (106:56 - 107:01)
and i'm like (106:59 - 107:02)
am i (107:01 - 107:05)
is is this my arc phone playlist why why (107:02 - 107:07)
did i have to mute it to go silent it's (107:05 - 107:09)
like a weird (107:07 - 107:11)
choice and the music doesn't work all (107:09 - 107:12)
the time (107:11 - 107:14)
i was literally surprised when music (107:12 - 107:16)
kicked in because i thought this was a (107:14 - 107:18)
music-less game (107:16 - 107:20)
i i have played every metal gear solid (107:18 - 107:23)
loved all of them (107:20 - 107:24)
stealth games (107:23 - 107:26)
that's yup uh (107:24 - 107:28)
it was very clear through every metal (107:26 - 107:30)
gear solid i (107:28 - 107:32)
very bad at stealth (107:30 - 107:35)
um but those games make it (107:32 - 107:37)
you could play it stealthy or or not and (107:35 - 107:39)
it's a little bit harder if you're not (107:37 - 107:41)
stealthy it's what i said earlier like (107:39 - 107:43)
it seems like the game is a cakewalk if (107:41 - 107:44)
you can stay in stealth and it seems (107:43 - 107:46)
like (107:44 - 107:47)
every single part of the kitchen is on (107:46 - 107:50)
fire as soon as somebody sees you um and (107:47 - 107:52)
it's very hectic (107:50 - 107:55)
i think that i think they accomplish (107:52 - 107:56)
stealth in this game actually (107:55 - 107:58)
pretty good (107:56 - 108:01)
uh like it doesn't feel like tedious (107:58 - 108:04)
stealth it does feel rewarding for your (108:01 - 108:06)
patients like i would rather (108:04 - 108:08)
i would rather wait in the grass for (108:06 - 108:09)
like 10 seconds (108:08 - 108:13)
to catch a teddy ursa than to make that (108:09 - 108:14)
teddy ursa upset and then be forced to (108:13 - 108:17)
battle it (108:14 - 108:19)
i agree like like i think i think it is (108:17 - 108:22)
rewarding for you to stay there and then (108:19 - 108:23)
once you get a little bit more complex (108:22 - 108:25)
and it's like if you do upset them you (108:23 - 108:27)
can switch to like the spoiled apricorns (108:25 - 108:29)
you can nail the teddy urse in the face (108:27 - 108:31)
switch back to the pokeball then throw (108:29 - 108:32)
it and then you have to go into the (108:31 - 108:33)
battle (108:32 - 108:36)
i think there is a lot of flexibility (108:33 - 108:37)
that the game gives you (108:36 - 108:39)
um which we haven't really talked about (108:37 - 108:41)
like i do think the game (108:39 - 108:45)
gives you multiple ways to play it (108:41 - 108:47)
uh up to the noble battle where you're (108:45 - 108:48)
kind of forced to play it one way and (108:47 - 108:51)
then back to like complete freedom again (108:48 - 108:53)
like it really gives you (108:51 - 108:54)
um that i think that's the word i would (108:53 - 108:56)
use it just gives you like flexibility (108:54 - 108:58)
you can kind of like go at your own pace (108:56 - 108:59)
if you just want to spend hours catching (108:58 - 109:01)
you can do that if you want to spend (108:59 - 109:02)
hours doing side missions if you want to (109:01 - 109:04)
spend hours just exploring if you want (109:02 - 109:05)
to (109:04 - 109:07)
reset for outbreaks if you want to look (109:05 - 109:09)
for distortions if you want to like farm (109:07 - 109:12)
materials like you can do so much but it (109:09 - 109:16)
does require you to like make that (109:12 - 109:18)
game plan (109:16 - 109:18)
um (109:18 - 109:20)
which again not to compare to breath of (109:18 - 109:22)
the wild but that was very much breath (109:20 - 109:24)
of the wild you can either do the next (109:22 - 109:25)
mission (109:24 - 109:27)
or you could (109:25 - 109:28)
walk in a direction and figure out (109:27 - 109:30)
what's there you can do this (109:28 - 109:32)
puzzle and you can do the next puzzle (109:30 - 109:34)
and you can do the next puzzle or you (109:32 - 109:35)
can (109:34 - 109:37)
um look for karax seeds right like there (109:35 - 109:39)
were so many different things to do and (109:37 - 109:41)
i do think like breath of the wild the (109:39 - 109:42)
game (109:41 - 109:44)
like in breath of the wild if you've (109:42 - 109:46)
never played it you could once you get a (109:44 - 109:47)
tutorial you could go straight to (109:46 - 109:49)
ganon's castle and you could battle (109:47 - 109:51)
ganondorf you could skip the entire game (109:49 - 109:53)
but the reason you could do that is (109:51 - 109:56)
because you were actually competent of (109:53 - 109:58)
how the game worked you were good at the (109:56 - 110:01)
game and you had the skill set to beat (109:58 - 110:04)
ganondorf right out of the gate (110:01 - 110:07)
and i think the the alpha pokemon are a (110:04 - 110:09)
really good sense of (110:07 - 110:11)
or a really good comparison of that (110:09 - 110:13)
example in breath of the wild (110:11 - 110:17)
i was able to catch a level 65 what was (110:13 - 110:19)
it was like a ursa ring and i was only (110:17 - 110:22)
like level 35 (110:19 - 110:23)
but because i was like i'm going to go (110:22 - 110:25)
into this i'm going to agile style (110:23 - 110:28)
hypnosis i'm going to (110:25 - 110:28)
um (110:28 - 110:31)
send out this which is i'm going to like (110:28 - 110:34)
strong style into that i'm going to then (110:31 - 110:35)
use these poke like and i was able to (110:34 - 110:38)
catch it so (110:35 - 110:41)
it it does reward you like i don't feel (110:38 - 110:43)
like oh i'm suddenly overpowered because (110:41 - 110:45)
now i have this pokemon 30 levels over (110:43 - 110:48)
because like i had the skill set to get (110:45 - 110:51)
it to begin with (110:48 - 110:53)
so like if i have the skill set to get a (110:51 - 110:56)
pokemon 30 levels above me (110:53 - 110:58)
it's not the level that is the problem (110:56 - 111:00)
like i i figured out the puzzle and i (110:58 - 111:02)
have the skills to go do it so it's not (111:00 - 111:05)
like i'm getting gated by anything (111:02 - 111:07)
so i really really like that about the (111:05 - 111:08)
game and i don't think (111:07 - 111:10)
i think they kind of started doing that (111:08 - 111:12)
with sword and shield of like oh look at (111:10 - 111:13)
these big scary pokemon you shouldn't be (111:12 - 111:15)
able to fight them and but i think i (111:13 - 111:18)
think they do it really really well here (111:15 - 111:19)
um (111:18 - 111:21)
and it makes it makes like finding (111:19 - 111:24)
pokemon just exciting (111:21 - 111:24)
i think we're out of time though (111:24 - 111:27)
there's so much more to say i know uh (111:28 - 111:32)
will give us our pokemon of the week (111:30 - 111:35)
uh well we have two um from the previous (111:32 - 111:37)
two weeks so (111:35 - 111:38)
uh (111:37 - 111:39)
from (111:38 - 111:41)
two weeks ago (111:39 - 111:44)
it was (111:41 - 111:47)
man i hope i haven't lost track of time (111:44 - 111:49)
i believe it's the one that is uh for (111:47 - 111:52)
the unova pokemon professor's friend uh (111:49 - 111:54)
it's directly linked to the introduction (111:52 - 111:56)
of hidden abilities and it could learn (111:54 - 111:58)
the move dream eater at 41 but now it's (111:56 - 112:02)
at 44 because of fairy type moves (111:58 - 112:05)
it's (112:02 - 112:05)
sylvian (112:05 - 112:11)
muna there was no sylveon in unova (112:07 - 112:13)
it is muna (112:11 - 112:15)
yes (112:13 - 112:17)
i haven't listened to the other one so i (112:15 - 112:20)
don't know because (112:17 - 112:20)
um (112:20 - 112:25)
it's not she's not a professor but she's (112:22 - 112:27)
the other like researcher and she's (112:25 - 112:30)
researching dreams and then (112:27 - 112:30)
the (112:30 - 112:32)
she uses the mist from muna to open up (112:30 - 112:34)
the dream world in dream world that's (112:32 - 112:36)
where you would first get pokemon with (112:34 - 112:38)
uh hidden abilities fennel is the one (112:36 - 112:41)
fennel fennel it's like doctor fennel (112:38 - 112:44)
yeah (112:41 - 112:44)
and next week (112:45 - 112:49)
all right so then well now so for last (112:46 - 112:52)
week first oh yeah greg didn't listen (112:49 - 112:53)
i have not listened so let me see if you (112:52 - 112:55)
can guess just from this clue greg while (112:53 - 112:57)
this pokemon is pretty much the opposite (112:55 - 112:59)
of the big fish pokemon and it doesn't (112:57 - 113:02)
evolve it does share a composite feature (112:59 - 113:04)
with a pokemon introduced in the hisooy (113:02 - 113:07)
region (113:04 - 113:07)
oh i actually think i know this (113:08 - 113:10)
well you better get it right because (113:09 - 113:13)
greg hasn't had a week to think about it (113:10 - 113:15)
is it wishy-washy it is whiskey yeah i (113:13 - 113:17)
was like it sounds like wishy-washy (113:15 - 113:19)
because big fish pokemon is basket (113:17 - 113:21)
legion which is made up of the souls of (113:19 - 113:23)
all of the (113:21 - 113:26)
ones that didn't survive and wishiwashi (113:23 - 113:28)
has the large form which is made up of a (113:26 - 113:30)
bunch of tiny mushy put together all (113:28 - 113:33)
right moon shuffle great moon shuffle (113:30 - 113:37)
uh shiny also great (113:33 - 113:37)
what's next week all right next week's (113:37 - 113:44)
this pokemon whose pre-evolution had to (113:40 - 113:46)
be brought the farthest across the pokey (113:44 - 113:50)
earth to arrive in jesui has a new form (113:46 - 113:53)
that now has a type weakness to its (113:50 - 113:56)
compatriot that it originally was strong (113:53 - 113:59)
against (113:56 - 113:59)
there you go (114:00 - 114:02)
okay um that's our episode we covered a (114:04 - 114:12)
