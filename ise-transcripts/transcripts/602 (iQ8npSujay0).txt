recording no issues this this episode (1:03 - 1:12)
Good Start um we have h a very Pokemon (1:07 - 1:19)
TCG and a very Pokemon heavy Pokemon Go (1:12 - 1:23)
episode hey you know this is a Pokemon (1:19 - 1:26)
podcast sometimes it's less of one every (1:23 - 1:29)
once in a (1:26 - 1:32)
while so (1:29 - 1:32)
we have Bobby here because of the TCG (1:32 - 1:37)
and Hannah's always (1:35 - 1:41)
[Laughter] (1:37 - 1:41)
here so it works (1:42 - 1:46)
out you won't believe what's going to (1:44 - 1:48)
happen this episode you thought we were (1:46 - 1:51)
done talking about van go you're wrong (1:48 - 1:55)
we have more van go to talk about fun (1:51 - 1:56)
fun (1:55 - 1:59)
stuff that that Pikachu will not leave (1:56 - 2:01)
us alone mm- (1:59 - 2:03)
um okay well before we get to all of (2:01 - 2:06)
that stuff there was some breaking news (2:03 - 2:07)
oh I guess we're going to dive right (2:06 - 2:10)
into news breaking news this (2:07 - 2:12)
weekend uh there are some more (2:10 - 2:13)
disqualifications at a Pokemon (2:12 - 2:16)
tournament and people were upset and the (2:13 - 2:19)
same arguments get thrown around uh (2:16 - 2:22)
arguments that I disagree with although (2:19 - 2:25)
I do find myself pretty open-minded so (2:22 - 2:27)
maybe somebody could convince me (2:25 - 2:29)
otherwise but it's it's been the same (2:27 - 2:33)
argument for couple years and I (2:29 - 2:37)
still I still have my opinion but (2:33 - 2:41)
um this past weekend was the uh which is (2:37 - 2:45)
the it was it was the biggest European (2:41 - 2:48)
tournament uh to (2:45 - 2:53)
date and two players got disqualified (2:48 - 2:56)
for having the same exact (2:53 - 2:59)
Pokemon now uh I know what you're (2:56 - 3:02)
thinking (2:59 - 3:02)
a lot of people use a program called pkx (3:02 - 3:08)
or whatever to make Pokemon this was a (3:05 - 3:10)
bit (3:08 - 3:13)
different um which the the the news here (3:10 - 3:15)
maybe I guess I guess the news takeaway (3:13 - 3:17)
maybe isn't people got disqualified that (3:15 - 3:21)
happens all the time because of using (3:17 - 3:23)
unauthorized software (3:21 - 3:26)
the I think the actual news to take away (3:23 - 3:28)
here is that there is a this is the (3:26 - 3:32)
first time this kind of hack check (3:28 - 3:34)
happened uh which is the more (3:32 - 3:36)
interesting thing to take away (3:34 - 3:39)
that that the the the hacking is the (3:36 - 3:43)
hack the hack checking has gotten better (3:39 - 3:47)
or they have at least known about it and (3:43 - 3:51)
implemented it and so what happened is (3:47 - 3:54)
pokey Alex who I've actually when I did (3:51 - 3:57)
the I did like a YouTube series with a (3:54 - 4:00)
bunch of YouTube creators the draft (3:57 - 4:02)
League thing Pokey Alex was a part of (4:00 - 4:05)
that um and I think I did like I he (4:02 - 4:07)
streams on Twitch very nice guy for my (4:05 - 4:09)
interactions I believe and then uh I (4:07 - 4:13)
don't know who the other person was but (4:09 - 4:14)
uh they were both on the same team (4:13 - 4:17)
they're sponsored uh which is another (4:14 - 4:18)
conversation that we could have about (4:17 - 4:20)
sponsored players going to an event but (4:18 - 4:22)
that that's that's fine that's not bad (4:20 - 4:24)
it's just it's a little weird because (4:22 - 4:26)
Pokemon doesn't like it specifically (4:24 - 4:28)
because they don't like to have (4:26 - 4:30)
sponsors oh they don't like spons (4:28 - 4:32)
players being in their um in their (4:30 - 4:34)
tournaments or in their competitions no (4:32 - 4:36)
they just don't like to have like (4:34 - 4:39)
sponsored players on their like video (4:36 - 4:40)
because they have to cover up like the (4:39 - 4:42)
logos and stuff got it okay and then if (4:40 - 4:44)
you're sponsoring somebody and you're (4:42 - 4:46)
covering up the logos then it's kind of (4:44 - 4:48)
like (4:46 - 4:52)
pointless right again a whole another (4:48 - 4:56)
conversation so they got disqualified (4:52 - 4:59)
for having a clone Pokemon now not to be (4:56 - 5:01)
confused with Pokemon the first movie (4:59 - 5:03)
where Mewtwo clones a bunch of Pokemon (5:01 - 5:08)
but you could compare it to (5:03 - 5:13)
that so they both had a Ting L that had (5:08 - 5:16)
the same OT and the same player ID (5:13 - 5:19)
number and you don't need to really have (5:16 - 5:24)
a hack check service to go you can only (5:19 - 5:27)
catch one ting Lop per (5:24 - 5:30)
file therefore this was OB obiously (5:27 - 5:33)
cloned I would assume although it (5:30 - 5:35)
doesn't say here nor would the Pokemon (5:33 - 5:37)
company come out and say Here's the (5:35 - 5:41)
exact issue I would assume that it was (5:37 - 5:43)
cloned using the (5:41 - 5:47)
smeargle uh which has we Hannah Al and I (5:43 - 5:49)
talked about last week this the smeargle (5:47 - 5:50)
thing they said there was going to be a (5:49 - 5:53)
January update (5:50 - 5:56)
3.0.1 it is now January 28th there is no (5:53 - 6:00)
update yet three days left three days (5:56 - 6:01)
left I'm assuming they're going to take (6:00 - 6:03)
in account the (6:01 - 6:06)
smeargle yeah I'm honestly surprised (6:03 - 6:08)
they haven't fixed that yet and I think (6:06 - 6:10)
that maybe they one of the reasons they (6:08 - 6:12)
caught this is because they're paying (6:10 - 6:14)
extra close attention because they (6:12 - 6:17)
haven't fixed that yet well I don't (6:14 - 6:19)
understand how the two of them that are (6:17 - 6:22)
teammates didn't think that that was (6:19 - 6:23)
going to (6:22 - 6:27)
get checked or like that was going to be (6:23 - 6:30)
noticed they they both got their ting (6:27 - 6:33)
from another player on their (6:30 - 6:36)
team and so that player gave them both (6:33 - 6:39)
the same tinglu that they duplicated or (6:36 - 6:40)
copied or cloned or however you want to (6:39 - 6:42)
say it but are they not talking to each (6:40 - 6:43)
other or like looking at each other's (6:42 - 6:45)
teams if they know they're getting a (6:43 - 6:47)
Pokemon unless they do they really think (6:45 - 6:50)
they were getting a legitimate Pokemon (6:47 - 6:51)
and not a clone because if if I'm (6:50 - 6:53)
getting a clone Pokemon I'm going to (6:51 - 6:55)
make sure that the other people on my (6:53 - 6:59)
team aren't also getting the same cloned (6:55 - 7:01)
Pokemon well if you didn't know that it (6:59 - 7:03)
was a cloned Pokemon and you weren't (7:01 - 7:05)
talking to your teammates about your (7:03 - 7:07)
exact team makeup the night (7:05 - 7:10)
before and they've never done a check (7:07 - 7:13)
like this before as far as we know as (7:10 - 7:17)
yeah as most of the the reason to clone (7:13 - 7:19)
hack that people can take advantage of (7:17 - 7:22)
the smeargle thing is kind of new right (7:19 - 7:26)
yeah I I I mean you you could bad I I I (7:22 - 7:28)
hate talking about (7:26 - 7:31)
like the (7:28 - 7:33)
I hate talking about hacked Pokemon (7:31 - 7:35)
because then it leads to like how do you (7:33 - 7:36)
hack and I don't want to like I don't (7:35 - 7:38)
want to like direct people on how to do (7:36 - 7:41)
that stuff but the reality is like (7:38 - 7:42)
people are getting disqualified because (7:41 - 7:46)
of this so like that's really the the (7:42 - 7:49)
the conversation right is not like how (7:46 - 7:51)
to do it it's like people are doing it (7:49 - 7:55)
that being said you can when you make a (7:51 - 7:58)
hacked Pokemon you can you can give it (7:55 - 7:59)
whatever IVs you want you can give it (7:58 - 8:02)
whatever level you want you could give a (7:59 - 8:04)
Pikachu Thunder or you could give a (8:02 - 8:06)
Pikachu like flamethrower if you wanted (8:04 - 8:08)
to right like you could but that (8:06 - 8:11)
wouldn't pass a hack check very well (8:08 - 8:13)
because Pikachu can't learn flamethrower (8:11 - 8:15)
that would be very obvious in a hack (8:13 - 8:17)
check so you ideally want to quote (8:15 - 8:20)
unquote hack a Pokemon that would look (8:17 - 8:23)
like a real Pokemon which is pretty easy (8:20 - 8:25)
to do now if (8:23 - 8:30)
you if uh like an oversight would be oh (8:25 - 8:32)
you caught this tinglu (8:30 - 8:36)
in kakami like that that can't happen or (8:32 - 8:40)
this tinglu has two perfect IVs which (8:36 - 8:42)
also cannot happen because tinglu has to (8:40 - 8:46)
be guaranteed three perfect IVs (8:42 - 8:48)
sometimes it'll have four because (8:46 - 8:49)
because one rolls to be perfect but it (8:48 - 8:51)
has to have at least three perfect IVs (8:49 - 8:54)
the thing that again caught this was the (8:51 - 8:56)
OT was the same and the player ID was (8:54 - 8:58)
the same and that's actually impossible (8:56 - 9:01)
to have M that I don't know if Pokey (8:58 - 9:03)
Alex and the other dude's teams were (9:01 - 9:06)
like the same that's not uncommon (9:03 - 9:07)
literally an hour before we started (9:06 - 9:12)
recording the person who won euic ended (9:07 - 9:14)
up using Wolfie's (9:12 - 9:19)
team um who won the team who won last (9:14 - 9:21)
week at it wasn't Columbus oh my gosh I (9:19 - 9:24)
can't remember uh that was the biggest (9:21 - 9:25)
tournament in the United States up to (9:24 - 9:29)
this point whatever city that was but (9:25 - 9:30)
they (9:29 - 9:32)
they from my understanding rebuilt the (9:30 - 9:34)
team from Wolfie's patreon they like (9:32 - 9:36)
because Wolfie will post his teams after (9:34 - 9:38)
they report it'll go in depth of like (9:36 - 9:40)
this is the ivys this is the nature so (9:38 - 9:43)
they they rebuilt the team so like well (9:40 - 9:46)
so then the the conversation happens of (9:43 - 9:49)
this is what always happens I think (9:46 - 9:50)
Hannah made a good point and I almost (9:49 - 9:53)
forgot it of (9:50 - 9:56)
like this is the first time we've heard (9:53 - 10:00)
of this kind of check MH (9:56 - 10:02)
and I think the reason we hear about (10:00 - 10:05)
this stuff is because these players have (10:02 - 10:07)
such a big (10:05 - 10:09)
audience like Pokey Alex is a a (10:07 - 10:12)
relatively like like has a YouTube (10:09 - 10:15)
relatively big streamer right and if you (10:12 - 10:17)
go back (10:15 - 10:20)
to Worlds where a bunch of people got (10:17 - 10:23)
disqualified there were a lot of bigger (10:20 - 10:26)
YouTubers or streamers a part of that (10:23 - 10:29)
complaining so what I'm saying is like (10:26 - 10:31)
you could have a person who maybe it's (10:29 - 10:32)
their first tournament maybe they've (10:31 - 10:33)
done very well they don't stream on (10:32 - 10:35)
YouTube they don't stream on (10:33 - 10:38)
Twitch they they hacked a Steelix and (10:35 - 10:40)
they got disqualified and they go on (10:38 - 10:42)
Twitter to complain but they're not a (10:40 - 10:45)
huge player so people don't see that (10:42 - 10:48)
sure that yeah that's true but also at (10:45 - 10:52)
the same time so were they playing (10:48 - 10:55)
matches at the same time they they must (10:52 - 10:57)
have been right because like they both (10:55 - 10:58)
got disqualified the same round which I (10:57 - 11:01)
think was around seven okay they're not (10:58 - 11:03)
like they just they just got (11:01 - 11:04)
disqualified from this tournament like (11:03 - 11:05)
he could have tra like they could have (11:04 - 11:07)
traded the one of them to the other one (11:05 - 11:08)
like if they're not playing at the same (11:07 - 11:11)
time could no the boxes are locked oh (11:08 - 11:13)
that's right of course right once the (11:11 - 11:15)
once it starts it's all locked right so (11:13 - 11:17)
you can't you wouldn't be able to right (11:15 - 11:18)
okay yeah it's it's not it's not (11:17 - 11:22)
surprising for players on a team to have (11:18 - 11:23)
similar (11:22 - 11:27)
teams um I even remember like (11:23 - 11:31)
Wolfie last year at worlds was like oh (11:27 - 11:33)
me and my friend are using the same team (11:31 - 11:36)
that we built together right and they (11:33 - 11:39)
both didn't do that well so it wasn't (11:36 - 11:40)
that great of a team maybe right right (11:39 - 11:43)
but yeah the OT obviously the OT and the (11:40 - 11:45)
ID being exactly the same is is (11:43 - 11:48)
different but um I was just thinking (11:45 - 11:50)
like it might not happen that often it (11:48 - 11:52)
also just might not happen that often (11:50 - 11:54)
because it just so happens that two (11:52 - 11:58)
people don't typically have the (11:54 - 12:00)
same like Pokemon at the same time you (11:58 - 12:03)
know as well so might be harder to see (12:00 - 12:05)
that like this was that's kind of (12:03 - 12:07)
surprising that two people on the same (12:05 - 12:10)
like that are on the same team just have (12:07 - 12:12)
the same clone Pokemon I I don't know I (12:10 - 12:13)
feel like that probably wouldn't happen (12:12 - 12:15)
that often not saying people wouldn't (12:13 - 12:18)
have cloned Pokemon I'm saying that bad (12:15 - 12:19)
combination of the two of them on the (12:18 - 12:22)
same team having the same cloned Pokemon (12:19 - 12:26)
yeah that makes the news extra uh fun in (12:22 - 12:31)
a way but I mean like I said the Clone (12:26 - 12:33)
thing is relatively new it is something (12:31 - 12:37)
they usually try to kind of minimize and (12:33 - 12:39)
and fix as soon as possible so these (12:37 - 12:40)
aren't the kinds of exploits we usually (12:39 - 12:43)
see it's usually gend Pokemon which is (12:40 - 12:46)
similar but not the same it with regards (12:43 - 12:49)
to the fact that they are both kind of (12:46 - 12:52)
popular bigger players I think that (12:49 - 12:54)
probably does play a factor in it but (12:52 - 12:56)
also this is a big tournament with a lot (12:54 - 12:58)
of people watching and when somebody (12:56 - 13:01)
who's got gotten far enough gets (12:58 - 13:04)
disqualified for some reason or another (13:01 - 13:06)
people are going to be talking about it (13:04 - 13:08)
which is one of the reasons we have seen (13:06 - 13:11)
a lot of disqualifications pop up over (13:08 - 13:15)
the last year or so regardless of who it (13:11 - 13:17)
is I (13:15 - 13:19)
think a lot of (13:17 - 13:21)
people don't believe they're going to (13:19 - 13:22)
check (13:21 - 13:26)
for for illegitimate (13:22 - 13:28)
Pokemon uh last week was Charlotte's (13:26 - 13:30)
regionals this week was Liverpool (13:28 - 13:34)
Regional so not EU I euic I misspoke (13:30 - 13:38)
there still a big one still the big I (13:34 - 13:40)
think it was bigger than last year's (13:38 - 13:44)
euic because of players attending (13:40 - 13:46)
attendance is been up for this game I (13:44 - 13:47)
don't know if yall I don't know if (13:46 - 13:51)
listeners know this but attendance for (13:47 - 13:53)
playing in person has been way up and (13:51 - 13:56)
that that in itself is news too because (13:53 - 14:00)
people like Tera as a battle mechanic (13:56 - 14:04)
and some like it more than Dynamax um so (14:00 - 14:07)
that the player count is up (14:04 - 14:11)
um so of course the argument is (14:07 - 14:13)
always (14:11 - 14:18)
um and this is what I disagree with uh (14:13 - 14:20)
that players shouldn't have to like (14:18 - 14:22)
build a team building a team takes too (14:20 - 14:25)
much time what does it matter the reason (14:22 - 14:29)
that people PK a hex or or Gen Pokemon (14:25 - 14:32)
is because like and I agree with that (14:29 - 14:35)
point I I do agree with the point that (14:32 - 14:38)
like your skill of building a team does (14:35 - 14:41)
not translate to your skill of playing (14:38 - 14:43)
and I say this all the time because I (14:41 - 14:44)
think when people want to get into (14:43 - 14:47)
competitive Pokemon they think that they (14:44 - 14:49)
need to do both and they think that (14:47 - 14:52)
because they because they built the team (14:49 - 14:55)
they're they will be better with it or (14:52 - 14:58)
because they're using a rental team (14:55 - 15:00)
they're not going to be as good those (14:58 - 15:02)
are just two different skills you can be (15:00 - 15:05)
really really good at playing the game (15:02 - 15:09)
and be very bad at understanding like (15:05 - 15:11)
why a certain Pokemon like you can (15:09 - 15:12)
understand like oh this Pokemon needs (15:11 - 15:15)
like EES and defense to make it bulkier (15:12 - 15:18)
but like that calculation side of thing (15:15 - 15:20)
things is is a little bit more (15:18 - 15:22)
complicated I see it all the time with (15:20 - 15:25)
like other creators doing like raid (15:22 - 15:27)
builds (15:25 - 15:32)
and they're EES don't make sense mhm (15:27 - 15:35)
when and and that's like that's not to (15:32 - 15:36)
like shame them it's like they just (15:35 - 15:38)
don't (15:36 - 15:41)
understand H why HP would be more (15:38 - 15:43)
important here than defense or why (15:41 - 15:45)
defense would be more important than HP (15:43 - 15:49)
or like why we're putting a a nature (15:45 - 15:53)
here um but not maxing out that like (15:49 - 15:55)
defense and I get they're just trying to (15:53 - 15:59)
be helpful in stuff but like no fault to (15:55 - 16:01)
them it's really complicated like when I (15:59 - 16:04)
talk about jump points when it comes to (16:01 - 16:06)
EVs and I literally know this because I (16:04 - 16:10)
paid a worldclass coach to teach me like (16:06 - 16:12)
EVs and competitive Pokemon and I I paid (16:10 - 16:14)
him for six months and that was Paul Ru (16:12 - 16:18)
Ru I can never say his last name um and (16:14 - 16:20)
it was very very helpful but like when I (16:18 - 16:22)
bring up jump points most listeners (16:20 - 16:23)
listening are like what's a jump point (16:22 - 16:26)
it's like when you get like a free EV by (16:23 - 16:28)
giving your Pokemon a specific amount of (16:26 - 16:29)
EV (16:28 - 16:31)
so like it's very (16:29 - 16:33)
complicated and you do see a lot of (16:31 - 16:35)
these players that compete at a very (16:33 - 16:38)
high level like normally when they win (16:35 - 16:41)
they'll be like oh thank you eight (16:38 - 16:42)
people because they like helped with the (16:41 - 16:44)
team or they helped with the idea like (16:42 - 16:46)
it's very complicated right I don't like (16:44 - 16:49)
buy the argument though like oh it's so (16:46 - 16:52)
timec consuming because they've just (16:49 - 16:55)
lowered the barrier so (16:52 - 16:59)
much and like in the case of tinglu (16:55 - 17:01)
you can you can get tinglu in like 15 (16:59 - 17:05)
minutes like you you could just Google (17:01 - 17:08)
tinglu swords go around the map real (17:05 - 17:10)
quick collect the the what is it eight (17:08 - 17:12)
swords 10 swords and then tinglu pops up (17:10 - 17:15)
and then you catch Ting like (17:12 - 17:18)
it's like out of all the Pokemon that (17:15 - 17:21)
was the one you got disqualified for one (17:18 - 17:24)
of the easier ones to get (17:21 - 17:26)
honestly (17:24 - 17:29)
yeah they really have lower the barrier (17:26 - 17:31)
to building a Pokemon that's one thing (17:29 - 17:34)
that I have been astonished by every (17:31 - 17:37)
time I'm working on the raid builds mhm (17:34 - 17:38)
is that it can (17:37 - 17:43)
take 15 minutes right or less to build a (17:38 - 17:46)
specific Pokemon with specific EVS MH (17:43 - 17:50)
that is not how it used to be oh and (17:46 - 17:52)
they continue to lower it even more with (17:50 - 17:54)
the blueberry Academy and the item (17:52 - 17:56)
printer because now even Tera isn't (17:54 - 17:58)
really hard anymore I'm not someone (17:56 - 18:00)
who's done a ton of Tera raids I did not (17:58 - 18:04)
have 999 Tera crystals of every single (18:00 - 18:08)
type pre blueberry but I sure do (18:04 - 18:11)
now well how many Pokemon are these (18:08 - 18:13)
people typically are the competitors (18:11 - 18:15)
typically building though I mean they're (18:13 - 18:16)
not they're not just building like a (18:15 - 18:18)
team right I'm assuming that they're (18:16 - 18:19)
they're building multiple teams because (18:18 - 18:21)
they're practicing with different stuff (18:19 - 18:22)
and they're trying out different (18:21 - 18:23)
combinations of things and stuff like (18:22 - 18:25)
that so you're build I am assuming (18:23 - 18:27)
they're only (18:25 - 18:33)
building one team maybe a week or or not (18:27 - 18:34)
I I think a lot of these players are (18:33 - 18:37)
practicing in Pokemon Showdown right (18:34 - 18:38)
okay because you can get like more (18:37 - 18:40)
matches done and it's it is easier to (18:38 - 18:41)
build a Pokemon there Pokemon Showdown (18:40 - 18:44)
is a a battle (18:41 - 18:46)
simulator even if you're if you're just (18:44 - 18:49)
buying the game to do matches and go to (18:46 - 18:52)
tournaments (18:49 - 18:52)
um you can you can get Pokemon from (18:52 - 18:56)
other people like they both got this (18:54 - 18:59)
tinglu from the same guy unfortunately (18:56 - 19:02)
the guy made a clone of the tinglu it (18:59 - 19:04)
cost them and gave them disqualification (19:02 - 19:08)
but like that's the weirdest part about (19:04 - 19:10)
Pokemon and I say weird in like a good (19:08 - 19:15)
way is if you don't have the (19:10 - 19:18)
resources you can trade or like if (19:15 - 19:20)
Hannah was like Hey I want to build a (19:18 - 19:22)
drag algae For an upcoming raid but I (19:20 - 19:25)
don't have electric terot type shards (19:22 - 19:28)
she could trade me her drag algae I can (19:25 - 19:31)
give it the Tera I could even like teach (19:28 - 19:33)
it acid spray and then I could like (19:31 - 19:35)
trade it back right like there is so (19:33 - 19:38)
many ways you can build a Pokemon that (19:35 - 19:42)
isn't just on you the player yourself (19:38 - 19:44)
like and then you know I I saw the (19:42 - 19:46)
argument of like people are like well (19:44 - 19:48)
you have to breed for perfect IVs and (19:46 - 19:50)
it's like why why it's 2024 why are we (19:48 - 19:52)
using the argument of breeding for IVs (19:50 - 19:53)
you can literally walk into any of the (19:52 - 19:57)
deli birds and just buy a bottle cap (19:53 - 19:59)
right just bottle cap (19:57 - 20:02)
it um yeah I mean unless you're well (19:59 - 20:06)
Hannah so nicely gave me a Claire way (20:02 - 20:08)
back when at some point when we were (20:06 - 20:11)
doing raids for something um but you had (20:08 - 20:13)
BR bred a bunch of them hadn't you of (20:11 - 20:16)
the I was having fun there yeah going (20:13 - 20:18)
for a whole bunch of perfects there but (20:16 - 20:19)
that was really (20:18 - 20:22)
nice I think I still have some if (20:19 - 20:24)
anybody's looking for perfect Cloud sire (20:22 - 20:29)
um but finally that's gonna win euic see (20:24 - 20:31)
when it comes around it was it's great (20:29 - 20:34)
in raids it's great for certain (20:31 - 20:37)
raids golden bottle cups are much easier (20:34 - 20:39)
to get again especially with the item (20:37 - 20:40)
printer I have many more of them now (20:39 - 20:44)
than I did before blueberry but (20:40 - 20:47)
also then people will bring up the fact (20:44 - 20:50)
that not every Pokemon needs perfect IVs (20:47 - 20:52)
and it's hard to get the ones with the (20:50 - 20:54)
zero IV exactly where you need it (20:52 - 20:56)
sometimes Ting L is probably one of (20:54 - 20:59)
those Pokemon that would want a zero IV (20:56 - 21:02)
in speed yes not in attack because it's (20:59 - 21:04)
a physical Pokemon so you don't have to (21:02 - 21:07)
worry about that although I haven't seen (21:04 - 21:09)
Foul Play on anyone's team sheets in (21:07 - 21:11)
like the last like six months so even (21:09 - 21:13)
like the I need zero in attack like (21:11 - 21:14)
there's not a lot of foul plays going (21:13 - 21:17)
around maybe some confusion because of (21:14 - 21:20)
like hurricane or something I guess so (21:17 - 21:21)
maybe this teammate of theirs just had a (21:20 - 21:24)
Ting loo with zero speed and both of (21:21 - 21:25)
them wanted (21:24 - 21:29)
it yeah I think you know they're there's (21:25 - 21:31)
probably another conversation to be had (21:29 - 21:32)
about (21:31 - 21:35)
like (21:32 - 21:35)
how optimal IVs (21:37 - 21:45)
will be a deciding factor in some (21:40 - 21:48)
matches I think a lot of players I would (21:45 - 21:50)
when I say a lot of players I think the (21:48 - 21:52)
people who are like (21:50 - 21:55)
complaining um which I feel like is all (21:52 - 21:59)
of Twitter or or whatnot um (21:55 - 22:04)
I see I see this all the time uh when (21:59 - 22:10)
uh when I when I do competitive is (22:04 - 22:14)
when when I when I like lose a match or (22:10 - 22:17)
when something goes poorly the first (22:14 - 22:18)
recommendation from like twitch chat is (22:17 - 22:20)
like you should change this move or you (22:18 - 22:23)
should change this (22:20 - 22:25)
and I think when when when you do lose a (22:23 - 22:27)
match you kind of have to walk away and (22:25 - 22:30)
say like did I lose this because (22:27 - 22:33)
I I should have had it I should have had (22:30 - 22:36)
more defense EVS or should I should I (22:33 - 22:39)
did I lose this because I was I was calm (22:36 - 22:42)
instead of Jolly or whatever right and a (22:39 - 22:45)
lot of the times the answer is no and (22:42 - 22:47)
even if the answer is (22:45 - 22:50)
like oh I lost the speed tie like we (22:47 - 22:52)
were both Jolly or we were both timid I (22:50 - 22:55)
lost the speed tie there's (22:52 - 22:58)
probably a turn earlier where you could (22:55 - 23:00)
have done something different so you (22:58 - 23:01)
weren't in that (23:00 - 23:04)
situation um and I I think even I think (23:01 - 23:07)
you see that a lot with just like when (23:04 - 23:08)
you watch these big tournaments on (23:07 - 23:10)
Twitch or YouTube and you're like (23:08 - 23:12)
watching twitch chat or YouTube chat go (23:10 - 23:15)
you got a lot of like armchair back (23:12 - 23:19)
seating uh Gamers that are like man what (23:15 - 23:21)
a bad play this person in the top two of (23:19 - 23:24)
the world's like the world's biggest (23:21 - 23:26)
Liverpool tournament like I don't think (23:24 - 23:28)
you have the right to say that's a bad (23:26 - 23:31)
play maybe you don't understand the play (23:28 - 23:33)
well that's any that's any competition (23:31 - 23:37)
right I mean take take any anything (23:33 - 23:39)
right take basketball right and you got (23:37 - 23:41)
people out there who are like oh what's (23:39 - 23:42)
wrong with this person's playing so (23:41 - 23:44)
terribly LeBron James what like what an (23:42 - 23:46)
awful you know or like Michael Jord you (23:44 - 23:48)
know you see that with the best of the (23:46 - 23:49)
best and you have people that are (23:48 - 23:51)
sitting at home on their couch like (23:49 - 23:53)
never lifted a basketball right and (23:51 - 23:54)
they're like they would have done so (23:53 - 23:56)
much better if they ran this play and (23:54 - 23:59)
it's it's like uh okay sure sure you (23:56 - 24:00)
know so you see that with any any (23:59 - 24:02)
competition yeah that's part of sports (24:00 - 24:06)
spectating I'm pretty sure (24:02 - 24:10)
yeah so yeah (24:06 - 24:10)
um I I I don't really buy the like it (24:11 - 24:18)
takes so long to build a Pokemon unless (24:14 - 24:21)
you haven't played your game at all (24:18 - 24:22)
there was there was a twitch Rivals (24:21 - 24:24)
tournament that I was a part (24:22 - 24:27)
of and uh part of the tournament was (24:24 - 24:29)
like a speedrun part where like who can (24:27 - 24:31)
get through the game the fastest and (24:29 - 24:33)
then the second part of the tournament (24:31 - 24:36)
was build a team to be a part of a (24:33 - 24:40)
competitive doubles VGC match (24:36 - 24:44)
and they said that you you weren't (24:40 - 24:45)
allowed to connect to the internet you (24:44 - 24:46)
weren't allowed to do raids you weren't (24:45 - 24:48)
allowed to trade with people and you had (24:46 - 24:50)
to just do it all yourself and you could (24:48 - 24:52)
you could spend as much time on it as (24:50 - 24:53)
you (24:52 - 24:55)
want but you had to stream it you (24:53 - 24:57)
couldn't like end stream and then like (24:55 - 24:59)
secretly build the Pokemon everything (24:57 - 25:00)
had to be live for the tournament the (24:59 - 25:03)
next day and let me tell (25:00 - 25:06)
you if if you thought sword and if you (25:03 - 25:07)
thought scarlet and violet was like a (25:06 - 25:10)
short game try to build a competitive (25:07 - 25:12)
team from scratch at the start of that (25:10 - 25:16)
game I will agree that that is very hard (25:12 - 25:19)
to do because like you you just have no (25:16 - 25:22)
resources and some of the stuff like oh (25:19 - 25:24)
I want like a choice band oh that (25:22 - 25:27)
doesn't that that doesn't unlock until (25:24 - 25:29)
after you like beat the for the store (25:27 - 25:30)
won't have it in stock until you do that (25:29 - 25:33)
like there are some things that are like (25:30 - 25:35)
gated by that but the game right right (25:33 - 25:38)
now was like 13 months out right like 14 (25:35 - 25:39)
months out it's been around for a while (25:38 - 25:42)
I would I would expect a lot of those (25:39 - 25:43)
players to at least play through the (25:42 - 25:45)
game but I'm I'm sure there's the (25:43 - 25:47)
argument of like I don't want to play (25:45 - 25:48)
through the actual I don't want to (25:47 - 25:50)
actually play the game I just want the (25:48 - 25:53)
the the VGC part of the game which (25:50 - 26:00)
I is valid to an extent right I'm (25:53 - 26:04)
um but I I think the the last point that (26:00 - 26:08)
we see anytime somebody gets cheat that (26:04 - 26:11)
that cheaters are found cheating is the (26:08 - 26:13)
reason they cheat is because the game is (26:11 - 26:17)
pay to win and Pokemon are hard to (26:13 - 26:22)
get so they're cheating because it makes (26:17 - 26:24)
it fair it's pay to win in the sense (26:22 - 26:27)
that you have to pay to yeah start where (26:24 - 26:29)
are they drawing the pay to win because (26:27 - 26:32)
because there are so many more aspects (26:29 - 26:35)
yeah I mean everyone has to buy the game (26:32 - 26:38)
there's a start so the the first (26:35 - 26:40)
argument to the Pay to Win is well you (26:38 - 26:43)
have to buy the DLC if you wanted (26:40 - 26:46)
U or if you want an ogre Pawn so that's (26:43 - 26:48)
another $30 (26:46 - 26:51)
right so they're they're considering $30 (26:48 - 26:53)
like they're considering ogre Pon is (26:51 - 26:55)
like a $30 pay to win because ogre Pon (26:53 - 26:57)
is very good she she's a queen she's (26:55 - 27:01)
great she's like uh what fourth most (26:57 - 27:03)
used uh at this recent tournament I (27:01 - 27:05)
don't have it in front of me (27:03 - 27:10)
nice that is awesome uh U again people (27:05 - 27:12)
consider a Pay to Win Pokemon you have (27:10 - 27:14)
to pay $30 for the DLC to get the cup Fu (27:12 - 27:17)
you have to evolve but you trade you can (27:14 - 27:19)
just trade you could you could trade yes (27:17 - 27:20)
that's what these people did with the (27:19 - 27:22)
tinglu which was available in the (27:20 - 27:24)
regular (27:22 - 27:26)
game make sense so the the only Pokemon (27:24 - 27:28)
that's in the top 10 that's not (27:26 - 27:31)
technically in scarlet and violet at all (27:28 - 27:35)
is Tornadus you would have (27:31 - 27:38)
to move it from another game you'd have (27:35 - 27:41)
to move it from Scarlet VI you'd have to (27:38 - 27:43)
move it from sword and shield or from (27:41 - 27:46)
Pokemon go and they are considering that (27:43 - 27:49)
pay to win I disagree with this (27:46 - 27:52)
altogether for the record um there's so (27:49 - 27:55)
many wi you can literally play Pokemon (27:52 - 27:57)
Go for free and then you can go and get (27:55 - 28:00)
use your free raid pass to get a free (27:57 - 28:03)
tornado so then just goes back to the (28:00 - 28:06)
argument of you shouldn't have to like (28:03 - 28:09)
play the game in order to be good at VGC (28:06 - 28:10)
because (28:09 - 28:14)
like you know I can't keep going down (28:10 - 28:17)
this Rabbit Hole this is awful this is (28:14 - 28:20)
why I am no longer on Twitter or X or (28:17 - 28:22)
whatever it's called because this is (28:20 - 28:25)
what happens all the time with this (28:22 - 28:27)
these types of like so they don't okay (28:25 - 28:30)
I'm I'm going to stop just (28:27 - 28:34)
continue yeah I I I I super disagree (28:30 - 28:36)
like in the in the situation with Pokey (28:34 - 28:39)
Alex and this is not any shade at Pokey (28:36 - 28:43)
Alex but but the the to to say like the (28:39 - 28:45)
game is paid to win and the dude spent (28:43 - 28:48)
probably well over $1,500 on a flight (28:45 - 28:52)
and your argument is that the $30 DLC is (28:48 - 28:55)
the actual pay to win part like I just I (28:52 - 28:57)
just don't buy it your arent right (28:55 - 28:59)
you're talking about like other people's (28:57 - 29:01)
argument like he he's not arguing this (28:59 - 29:04)
is paay away no no no poke AR just (29:01 - 29:06)
clarifying that I'm very sure that poke (29:04 - 29:08)
Alex no no I just clarifying that for (29:06 - 29:13)
everyone that it's he's not making that (29:08 - 29:13)
argument far into things like being able (29:13 - 29:18)
to afford a flight being able to afford (29:16 - 29:22)
to get more sleep or better food and (29:18 - 29:25)
being able to afford the $10 patreon to (29:22 - 29:27)
Wolfie to then get Wolfie's team to (29:25 - 29:29)
build that like being able to afford the (29:27 - 29:31)
$70 to even enter the (29:29 - 29:35)
competition there there is money here in (29:31 - 29:39)
but the the money here is is any PR (29:35 - 29:43)
level sports related thing like think of (29:39 - 29:45)
like a bowling league you could rent a (29:43 - 29:48)
bowling ball you could buy your own (29:45 - 29:50)
bowling ball I don't know how much a (29:48 - 29:53)
bowling ball costs but I'm going to wait (29:50 - 29:55)
I'm going to wager to bet that there's a (29:53 - 29:58)
very cheap pro bowling ball you can buy (29:55 - 30:00)
and probably a significantly more (29:58 - 30:02)
expensive that is correct bowling ball (30:00 - 30:06)
you can buy you got to buy shoes you got (30:02 - 30:08)
to S you got to pay for the lane you got (30:06 - 30:10)
to pay probably the club fee I've heard (30:08 - 30:12)
that the club fees for bowling have (30:10 - 30:16)
gotten pretty expensive to be (30:12 - 30:19)
in are you near a good bowling alley are (30:16 - 30:21)
you not there are advantages and (30:19 - 30:23)
disadvantages to like everyone's (30:21 - 30:25)
situation here right like the reason (30:23 - 30:27)
Michael Phelps is very good at swimming (30:25 - 30:29)
is because he has like an extra like (30:27 - 30:32)
weird diaphragm thing in his chest like (30:29 - 30:35)
like he has an actual Advantage he was (30:32 - 30:38)
born with the man the man knows how to (30:35 - 30:41)
swim very (30:38 - 30:44)
good and extra long arms I think yes his (30:41 - 30:46)
arms are yeah I think his arms are like (30:44 - 30:50)
longer than but anyways going back to (30:46 - 30:53)
Pokemon the the argument like that ogre (30:50 - 30:58)
Pon and U are pay to win is just not not (30:53 - 31:01)
like it's just such a bad argument it's (30:58 - 31:03)
a very narrow argument they're only (31:01 - 31:06)
looking at one specific thing like I get (31:03 - 31:09)
that in like valerant or Apex or (31:06 - 31:10)
fortnite I'm pick I just pick three (31:09 - 31:14)
Shooters well here throw Counter Strike (31:10 - 31:16)
like there's four shooters for you (31:14 - 31:18)
they're all different right there there (31:16 - 31:22)
is no like you have to you have to like (31:18 - 31:24)
build your character before you go into (31:22 - 31:27)
the match right that that doesn't exist (31:24 - 31:29)
you have skins (31:27 - 31:32)
sure but I think but I get that people (31:29 - 31:35)
are comparing Pokemon to those games (31:32 - 31:39)
like look at these people don't have to (31:35 - 31:41)
actually (31:39 - 31:44)
play a like story mode of these games in (31:41 - 31:48)
order to compete at a high level (31:44 - 31:50)
sure then they can play those games I (31:48 - 31:52)
don't (31:50 - 31:54)
understand but I don't think that's a (31:52 - 31:57)
good argument either because like this (31:54 - 31:58)
goes back (31:57 - 32:01)
to you could just trade like Pokey Alex (31:58 - 32:03)
did I hey man I don't have a tinglu can (32:01 - 32:05)
somebody get me a tinglu tonight yeah (32:03 - 32:08)
and he got a TL I'm sorry but the the (32:05 - 32:10)
argument of pay to win for things like (32:08 - 32:14)
ogre Pon and uh Ury Fu that's fine (32:10 - 32:15)
that's a fine argument it's really hard (32:14 - 32:17)
to put it into this place where they (32:15 - 32:19)
traded for a Pokemon that isn't in the (32:17 - 32:22)
DLC like this was cloned Pokemon that (32:19 - 32:25)
was not even in the DLC it wasn't pay to (32:22 - 32:28)
play or pay to win you know like other (32:25 - 32:31)
than having to buy Scarlet or Violet but (32:28 - 32:34)
otherwise you know this situation (32:31 - 32:38)
specifically not a paay in Pokemon um (32:34 - 32:39)
but I get that it's like a larger It's a (32:38 - 32:41)
larger discussion at that point you know (32:39 - 32:44)
so yeah but like I think the other thing (32:41 - 32:47)
to keep in mind (32:44 - 32:47)
is like you you could argue that like oh (32:47 - 32:55)
I I I had to buy sword and shield and (32:52 - 32:58)
then I had to buy the DLC and then once (32:55 - 33:00)
I did that I was able to get Tornadus (32:58 - 33:02)
and then I moved Tornadus into my own (33:00 - 33:05)
game right like imagine that there is (33:02 - 33:10)
maybe somebody who wants to use Tornadus (33:05 - 33:13)
and lives in the middle of nowhere so (33:10 - 33:15)
Pokemon goes not an option and now they (33:13 - 33:19)
have to spend what $90 to get Tornadus I (33:15 - 33:21)
still think that's a really weak (33:19 - 33:23)
argument overall because that would be (33:21 - 33:25)
that would that would technically be the (33:23 - 33:28)
only way they would they would get tus (33:25 - 33:30)
is unless they were having it traded (33:28 - 33:31)
from somebody (33:30 - 33:33)
generous right but I'm saying they like (33:31 - 33:35)
I'm saying that if they if they have no (33:33 - 33:37)
way to (33:35 - 33:40)
trade person have internet access but (33:37 - 33:41)
they're somehow playing tournaments (33:40 - 33:44)
online I don't understand this yeah you (33:41 - 33:45)
can see this argument is falling apart (33:44 - 33:47)
how are they practicing if they don't (33:45 - 33:48)
have internet and they don't yeah you (33:47 - 33:51)
could see this is falling apart very (33:48 - 33:53)
quickly the GTS is also there where you (33:51 - 33:55)
could trade right does this mean do like (33:53 - 33:57)
do I need to transfer a bunch of tornado (33:55 - 33:58)
into home so I can start just trading (33:57 - 34:00)
them off with people is this I didn't (33:58 - 34:04)
realize tornad was such a sought after (34:00 - 34:07)
Pokemon but okay but like then then I (34:04 - 34:10)
think about like I think about like my (34:07 - 34:13)
incar which I caught or which I bred for (34:10 - 34:15)
in Ultra Sun Ultra Moon I used that (34:13 - 34:19)
incore all two of the three years in (34:15 - 34:21)
sword and shield because it was not (34:19 - 34:23)
allowed the first (34:21 - 34:26)
year and I'm going to use it in scarlet (34:23 - 34:28)
and violet probably for the next two (34:26 - 34:29)
years because we would assume that (34:28 - 34:31)
Scarlet Violet's going to be the (34:29 - 34:33)
competitive game for the next two more (34:31 - 34:35)
years one would assume we'll see if (34:33 - 34:38)
we're counting DLC as its own game you (34:35 - 34:40)
have the scarland Violet DLC you have (34:38 - 34:41)
scarland Violet you have the sword and (34:40 - 34:43)
shield DLC you have sword and shield you (34:41 - 34:45)
have let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee (34:43 - 34:47)
which yes you cannot get incinerar in (34:45 - 34:49)
but let's say you caught a zaptos in (34:47 - 34:51)
that game you could move it up you got (34:49 - 34:53)
brilliant Diamond shining (34:51 - 34:56)
Pearl that you got Legends archus which (34:53 - 34:57)
again you could catch a Pokemon in there (34:56 - 34:59)
that (34:57 - 35:02)
is eight games (34:59 - 35:06)
ago right oh it's not eight now you're (35:02 - 35:08)
holding up seven fingers no I know that (35:06 - 35:09)
was seven games so that was the eighth (35:08 - 35:11)
game ago right okay got it got it okay (35:09 - 35:14)
yes cuz I got it from Ultras Sun ult (35:11 - 35:17)
correct correct okay so that incin has (35:14 - 35:21)
lasted through all of these games and I (35:17 - 35:23)
can still use it (35:21 - 35:25)
today which is pretty unique to Pokemon (35:23 - 35:28)
and pretty cool so I don't buy the (35:25 - 35:31)
argument of (35:28 - 35:33)
like pay to (35:31 - 35:36)
win in at that level because once you (35:33 - 35:39)
have that once you got that ersy Fu in (35:36 - 35:41)
in in sword and shield you can move it (35:39 - 35:44)
up and change it they they they got they (35:41 - 35:46)
got berries they got Moshi they got (35:44 - 35:49)
mints you can make the erif fu however (35:46 - 35:51)
you want again you can restart it you (35:49 - 35:55)
already got it like at the very core you (35:51 - 35:57)
need to buy Ultras Sun Ultra moon to (35:55 - 36:01)
participate in tournaments and back then (35:57 - 36:03)
and before that you had to buy sun and (36:01 - 36:04)
moon the real the only difference (36:03 - 36:06)
between Sun and Moon and Ultra sun and (36:04 - 36:08)
moon were two Pokemon and only one of (36:06 - 36:11)
them was good it was stakataka no one (36:08 - 36:13)
was using (36:11 - 36:16)
bulon so yes you did have to buy a $40 (36:13 - 36:19)
new game for one new Pokemon and (36:16 - 36:23)
participate and then before that it was (36:19 - 36:25)
X and Y you bought that that was the (36:23 - 36:27)
game you played for a year then you (36:25 - 36:29)
moved over to a mega ruby alpha Safar (36:27 - 36:31)
and you played that for a year like (36:29 - 36:33)
Steve you have to remember that there (36:31 - 36:35)
are also people who make the argument (36:33 - 36:38)
prior to PVP being a thing in Pokemon go (36:35 - 36:41)
that Pokemon go was paid to win and (36:38 - 36:43)
there's not even anything to win in (36:41 - 36:45)
Pokemon go there isn't there prior to (36:43 - 36:48)
PVP is what I'm saying so there wasn't (36:45 - 36:50)
an end game to it and people were still (36:48 - 36:53)
complaining about it being paay to win (36:50 - 36:56)
and so I mean I think these arguments (36:53 - 36:57)
are going to be made until the end of (36:56 - 37:01)
time even if they open up allowing (36:57 - 37:02)
cloned Pokemon they're going to be like (37:01 - 37:03)
well now you got to pay someone to clone (37:02 - 37:05)
it now you got to pay you know if you (37:03 - 37:06)
don't know how to do it you got to pay (37:05 - 37:08)
someone else to do it like it's gonna (37:06 - 37:11)
it'll be there forever the fact that (37:08 - 37:12)
people are going around being like ah (37:11 - 37:16)
yeah ogre Pon is pay to win when it's (37:12 - 37:22)
like $30 is half $30 for a whole game is (37:16 - 37:25)
half the cost of entering the tournament (37:22 - 37:29)
yeah the tournament is $0 to enter and (37:25 - 37:31)
reaching out to friends who might be (37:29 - 37:33)
able to be nice and trade your Pokemon (37:31 - 37:36)
is free yeah I mean I'll I'll give that (37:33 - 37:38)
not everyone playing competitively is (37:36 - 37:40)
going to tournaments right they're just (37:38 - 37:42)
they're playing the stuff they can do (37:40 - 37:43)
online right and I could see people (37:42 - 37:45)
being like Oh well I don't I'm not (37:43 - 37:47)
getting further into this because I feel (37:45 - 37:49)
like it's pay to pay to win and I don't (37:47 - 37:51)
have the DLC and I don't get ogre paon (37:49 - 37:53)
and things like that so there are people (37:51 - 37:56)
who aren't paying to compete they're (37:53 - 37:58)
just doing it (37:56 - 38:00)
through I mean they paid to get the game (37:58 - 38:01)
we could go all the way back to the (38:00 - 38:04)
beginning on this but uh here's I got I (38:01 - 38:07)
got one more point the the number one (38:04 - 38:09)
Pokemon throughout this entire (38:07 - 38:12)
tournament and for past tournaments do (38:09 - 38:13)
you guys do you guys know what the (38:12 - 38:15)
number one Pokemon being used (38:13 - 38:17)
is I have an idea but no I don't I'm not (38:15 - 38:21)
gonna be surprised by it but no it is (38:17 - 38:23)
flutter (38:21 - 38:25)
man who only (38:23 - 38:29)
appears in one of the two games well (38:25 - 38:31)
technically well it it did appear to in (38:29 - 38:34)
both games this (38:31 - 38:39)
weekend now as of right now yes so if if (38:34 - 38:40)
if all of these pay to win people if (38:39 - 38:43)
your core argument (38:40 - 38:46)
is what trade I don't want to trade or (38:43 - 38:50)
like owning old games is unfair what if (38:46 - 38:53)
at the start of this cycle you bought (38:50 - 38:56)
Violet and your argument is like oh well (38:53 - 38:59)
Trading or or owning multiple games is (38:56 - 39:02)
unfair okay don't trade guess what the (38:59 - 39:05)
actual number one Pokemon is in the game (39:02 - 39:06)
that you just didn't happen to buy (39:05 - 39:08)
because you had no clue like I just (39:06 - 39:10)
don't buy your argument anymore if (39:08 - 39:12)
you're G to say that ogre ogre Pon or U (39:10 - 39:15)
are the Pay to Win Pokemon but literally (39:12 - 39:17)
the number one Pokemon is a virgin (39:15 - 39:19)
virgin (39:17 - 39:21)
exclusive and like that's not exclusive (39:19 - 39:23)
to scarlet and violet like this happened (39:21 - 39:25)
in sword and shield guess what the (39:23 - 39:28)
number one Pokémon in that game was (39:25 - 39:28)
zashi guess who bought Shield (39:29 - 39:36)
me zashin and ogrean are a little (39:33 - 39:38)
different because there's only one per (39:36 - 39:42)
save and flutter man is not but I still (39:38 - 39:44)
don't by the Pay to Win argument it's (39:42 - 39:46)
still structured off of the way our (39:44 - 39:48)
society is and that's not going to (39:46 - 39:50)
something Pokemon can change I guess the (39:48 - 39:52)
argument has been going back a long time (39:50 - 39:55)
but the whole purp like Pokemon's built (39:52 - 39:57)
on this whole you need to to trade with (39:55 - 39:59)
each other system like if you have (39:57 - 40:02)
played Pokemon for any time in the last (39:59 - 40:07)
27 28 years the whole concept is to (40:02 - 40:09)
catch them and to trade them with each (40:07 - 40:11)
other right like going all the way back (40:09 - 40:15)
to the very beginning uh so uh you know (40:11 - 40:18)
it's it's a little bit like you can be (40:15 - 40:21)
mad about like having to do that but (40:18 - 40:22)
it's also like you kind of know what (40:21 - 40:25)
you're getting into like when you come (40:22 - 40:27)
along to Pokemon that's (40:25 - 40:30)
even if you were a new player and you (40:27 - 40:34)
didn't buy sword and shield so like like (40:30 - 40:36)
you you could argue that the the current (40:34 - 40:38)
competitive scene you'd have to spend (40:36 - 40:42)
$90 and that $90 should ultimately carry (40:38 - 40:45)
you throughout the next three years (40:42 - 40:47)
that's how it was for sord and shield (40:45 - 40:51)
right you spent $60 in the base game $30 (40:47 - 40:52)
on DLC hopefully you bought sword and (40:51 - 40:55)
out shield and now that's that's your (40:52 - 40:57)
investment for 3 years of (40:55 - 41:00)
competitive um if for some reason this (40:57 - 41:01)
is your very first Pokemon game and (41:00 - 41:04)
you're getting competitive and you (41:01 - 41:07)
needed Tornadus I (41:04 - 41:11)
guess I guess you're up to like (41:07 - 41:14)
$180 because you had to spend 90 twice (41:11 - 41:18)
but that's that's still cheaper than (41:14 - 41:21)
like joining a basketball Club it's (41:18 - 41:23)
still cheaper than playing bowling or (41:21 - 41:27)
the TCG you ever buy 10 you ever buy a (41:23 - 41:29)
tennis (41:27 - 41:33)
racket tennis racket's like (41:29 - 41:33)
$480 and I'm sure you can find a more (41:33 - 41:37)
expensive (41:36 - 41:39)
one (41:37 - 41:42)
yes but even going even the Bobby's made (41:39 - 41:43)
a great point because we're about to (41:42 - 41:46)
switch over to TCG after the break I (41:43 - 41:49)
played TCG competitively for three years (41:46 - 41:54)
I promise you I was spending minimum (41:49 - 41:59)
$200 every 3 months to play the TCG y (41:54 - 42:01)
That's why I never bought TCG that's why (41:59 - 42:03)
I never got into the TCG growing up (42:01 - 42:05)
because that one is very clearly (42:03 - 42:08)
inaccessible and and here's my takeaway (42:05 - 42:11)
I don't think when Wolfie won last week (42:08 - 42:14)
anyone said well the reason Wolfie won (42:11 - 42:18)
is because he bought that $30 DLC and I (42:14 - 42:22)
didn't that's why he won I spent the $70 (42:18 - 42:24)
to participate in this tournament I (42:22 - 42:26)
spent the $500 on the hotel I spent the (42:24 - 42:28)
$1,000 flight (42:26 - 42:31)
but couldn't I couldn't afford the $30 (42:28 - 42:33)
ogre pond that's where I drew the line (42:31 - 42:36)
right there it's just a ridiculous (42:33 - 42:39)
argument (42:36 - 42:42)
y I want to I want to be in this bowling (42:39 - 42:44)
league (42:42 - 42:47)
but I'm not going to rent my Lane I draw (42:44 - 42:48)
the line of renting my (42:47 - 42:55)
[Laughter] (42:48 - 42:58)
ball uh it does suck that they got (42:55 - 43:00)
disqualified um because Pokey Alex is a (42:58 - 43:02)
pretty pretty good player uh and my one (43:00 - 43:04)
time interacting with him he was very (43:02 - 43:07)
nice uh but yeah especially if they did (43:04 - 43:10)
get it from someone not realiz like they (43:07 - 43:11)
because I was reading that the the (43:10 - 43:13)
tweets from them or I think from poke (43:11 - 43:16)
Alex and me mentioning that they were (43:13 - 43:17)
they were saying that they didn't (43:16 - 43:19)
realize they just got it from a teammate (43:17 - 43:22)
and didn't realize and if that is true (43:19 - 43:24)
like that is a bummer because then (43:22 - 43:27)
that's just on your teammate who (43:24 - 43:29)
knew what they were doing and maybe just (43:27 - 43:30)
thought like oh this isn't going to get (43:29 - 43:32)
checked whatever it's like not a big (43:30 - 43:35)
deal who knows but if they legitimately (43:32 - 43:37)
got that as a trade which we just went (43:35 - 43:38)
back to like the whole purpose of (43:37 - 43:40)
Pokemon is trading right like so they're (43:38 - 43:42)
like trading to get the Pokemon that (43:40 - 43:45)
they were going to use um and it just so (43:42 - 43:47)
happened and you wouldn't even know like (43:45 - 43:48)
you said if they didn't converse with (43:47 - 43:50)
their other teammate about that or (43:48 - 43:51)
they're just like oh they also have a (43:50 - 43:53)
tinglu but maybe aren't thinking like (43:51 - 43:55)
well we should check that it's not the (43:53 - 43:57)
same exact Pokemon if that's truly what (43:55 - 43:59)
happened like that is such a bummer (43:57 - 44:02)
because um I mean I guess it is on them (43:59 - 44:04)
at the end of the day but it's also kind (44:02 - 44:07)
of tough like it's individually in your (44:04 - 44:08)
game and you're not really thinking like (44:07 - 44:09)
well I hope that person on over there (44:08 - 44:12)
doesn't have the exact same one yeah (44:09 - 44:14)
there wouldn't have been a way for them (44:12 - 44:16)
to check and that's that's one tricky (44:14 - 44:18)
part where it does get into relying on (44:16 - 44:19)
people you really have to trust the (44:18 - 44:24)
person yeah um which is tricky and (44:19 - 44:26)
unfortunate but what I think people need (44:24 - 44:29)
to take away from the continued (44:26 - 44:31)
disqualifications is just that Pokemon (44:29 - 44:34)
is checking for this as much as they can (44:31 - 44:38)
and we know this and we've known this (44:34 - 44:42)
so just generated Pokemon hacked (44:38 - 44:47)
Pokemon cloned Pokemon are not welcome (44:42 - 44:48)
in (44:47 - 44:51)
competition (44:48 - 44:51)
yep uh okay we'll take a quick break and (44:52 - 44:56)
then uh we're going to transition over (44:54 - 44:58)
we're going to transition over to TCG (44:56 - 45:00)
but not competitive TCG we're done with (44:58 - 45:01)
the competitive (45:00 - 45:04)
stuff there's a brand new set that came (45:01 - 45:06)
out uh I opened some I think Bobby (45:04 - 45:09)
opened way more than I did uh so we will (45:06 - 45:13)
be right (45:09 - 45:13)
back and we are back from our (45:13 - 45:21)
break uh I used to spend $200 every (45:17 - 45:25)
three months on TCG I don't anymore um (45:21 - 45:28)
but if I was to spend $200 it would (45:25 - 45:30)
probably be on this set because so far (45:28 - 45:33)
it's been pretty fun to open uh there's (45:30 - 45:37)
no press release here but palan Fates (45:33 - 45:39)
has arrived which is what do they call (45:37 - 45:42)
this it's not it's like a (45:39 - 45:44)
special holiday they call it a holiday (45:42 - 45:46)
set I think holiday set (45:44 - 45:49)
yeah um we talked about this before how (45:46 - 45:50)
they (45:49 - 45:55)
featured sured as one of the shiny (45:50 - 45:57)
Pokemon (45:55 - 45:59)
worst possible shinies it wasn't even (45:57 - 46:02)
just the cillage either no they chose (45:59 - 46:05)
the worst possible shinies three of the (46:02 - 46:08)
four shinies on the pack art for the (46:05 - 46:09)
things are (46:08 - 46:13)
like not that different obv the dondoo (46:09 - 46:16)
is very different but seeing how many (46:13 - 46:18)
shinies there are in the actual set I'm (46:16 - 46:20)
almost wondering if that's because they (46:18 - 46:22)
don't want people to (46:20 - 46:25)
realize yeah there's a lot that there (46:22 - 46:27)
are the shinies in here I think ttin of (46:25 - 46:29)
ton shiny is pretty good it is the (46:27 - 46:32)
hammer isn't it yeah it goes from Silver (46:29 - 46:34)
to Copper it's not super noticeable (46:32 - 46:35)
though in the pack art because of the (46:34 - 46:37)
way it's holding the hammer like it's (46:35 - 46:38)
not the hammer is not the focus of the (46:37 - 46:41)
pack art and then Pikachu is obviously a (46:38 - 46:43)
slight slightly golden which I like I I (46:41 - 46:45)
think it's the cool shiny and the shiny (46:43 - 46:47)
in the sets cool but the three of the (46:45 - 46:50)
four of them are very are barely (46:47 - 46:53)
noticeable well I think tasu is hard too (46:50 - 46:54)
because there's three of them and you're (46:53 - 46:58)
like which one is this one yeah uh so (46:54 - 47:02)
the the set is out now not the full set (46:58 - 47:03)
because there's going to be (47:02 - 47:07)
more right so they're doing this in (47:03 - 47:10)
three waves so what released on uh (47:07 - 47:14)
January 26th was the elite trainer boxes (47:10 - 47:17)
and the three-pack blisters so the (47:14 - 47:19)
three-pack blister comes (47:17 - 47:22)
with three comes with three packs of (47:19 - 47:26)
cards uh a promo card which is a shiny (47:22 - 47:29)
Pokémon uh and then a sticker they used (47:26 - 47:31)
to do coins back in the sword and shield (47:29 - 47:34)
era and prior they switched it to (47:31 - 47:37)
stickers so it's a sticker and the promo (47:34 - 47:41)
card um so you can pick either uh Pho (47:37 - 47:45)
massief or uh graveyard and so you get a (47:41 - 47:47)
promo card of them a shiny one and then (47:45 - 47:50)
you get a sticker of shiny one of those (47:47 - 47:52)
the dogs and three packs yeah yeah all (47:50 - 47:54)
the all the puppies um and their (47:52 - 47:56)
evolutions are all in the in the set as (47:54 - 47:59)
like shinies as well so but those are (47:56 - 48:01)
the two things that released on Friday (47:59 - 48:04)
uh in February there's going to be um (48:01 - 48:06)
February 9th will be the release of the (48:04 - 48:09)
tins so mini tins uh the bigger tins as (48:06 - 48:12)
well that contain like five packs and (48:09 - 48:13)
the collection (48:12 - 48:16)
boxes and then at the end of February (48:13 - 48:19)
February 23rd they're going to release (48:16 - 48:21)
the booster bundle which is just a box (48:19 - 48:24)
that contains six packs of cards with no (48:21 - 48:26)
no promo cards or anything else it's (48:24 - 48:29)
just six packs in a box so those are the (48:26 - 48:31)
three waves of of release for this for (48:29 - 48:33)
this (48:31 - 48:36)
set which is weird they don't usually do (48:33 - 48:38)
that they did it for like Crown Zenith (48:36 - 48:40)
they they released Crown Zenith for like (48:38 - 48:42)
six months it was it was they had new (48:40 - 48:44)
Crown Zenith products that came out for (48:42 - 48:47)
every month for like six months um even (48:44 - 48:49)
like mixed in with when scarlet and (48:47 - 48:50)
violet B set came out they just mixed (48:49 - 48:52)
Crown Zenith in there and and kept (48:50 - 48:54)
releasing Crown Zenith product so I (48:52 - 48:55)
think it's kind of weird when they do (48:54 - 48:56)
that (48:55 - 48:59)
so I think this is the third (48:56 - 49:02)
American shiny set there was this is (48:59 - 49:04)
palde and Fates and then there was (49:02 - 49:07)
hidden Fates and then there was shiny (49:04 - 49:11)
fat shin right shining Fates (49:07 - 49:14)
yeah and I I would I would assume that (49:11 - 49:17)
these sets do pretty well because they (49:14 - 49:19)
are shiny focused a lot of them are like (49:17 - 49:23)
reprints of cards um that already exist (49:19 - 49:25)
but now they have like the illustration (49:23 - 49:27)
rares and the special illustration R so (49:25 - 49:29)
I think those are those are super cool (49:27 - 49:31)
um Bobby you've opened way more cards (49:29 - 49:33)
than I have I I did I did open some for (49:31 - 49:36)
the audio listeners I'm holding up a ETB (49:33 - 49:38)
I bought this with my own money by the (49:36 - 49:40)
way no one no one sometimes Pokemon (49:38 - 49:42)
sends me stuff but disclosure I I did (49:40 - 49:43)
pay for this (49:42 - 49:47)
um how do you feel about this compared (49:43 - 49:50)
to the the past set hidden sets hidden (49:47 - 49:53)
Fates sets hidden Fates shining Fates (49:50 - 49:55)
shining Fates is tough to contend with (49:53 - 49:57)
because it was right at the height of (49:55 - 50:00)
you couldn't buy Pokemon cards anywhere (49:57 - 50:03)
so so just your hands on it was exciting (50:00 - 50:04)
yeah it was exciting to get your hands (50:03 - 50:06)
on it it was also frustrating because (50:04 - 50:08)
you know 95% of the time you weren't (50:06 - 50:10)
able to get you know go pick up shining (50:08 - 50:13)
Fates you just would see the etbs (50:10 - 50:15)
popping up on eBay for five times as (50:13 - 50:16)
much and you know and stuff like that (50:15 - 50:20)
yeah um that was frustrating I would say (50:16 - 50:22)
I don't know how many Shiny Pokemon are (50:20 - 50:24)
in shining Fates but there are a lot in (50:22 - 50:26)
palan Fates there's like (50:24 - 50:31)
137 Shiny Pokemon cards in helan Fates (50:26 - 50:36)
and that in itself is a little bit with (50:31 - 50:37)
the fact that the Scarlet Violet Era (50:36 - 50:41)
cards don't hold their value as much it (50:37 - 50:43)
makes it a little tougher to want to buy (50:41 - 50:46)
a bunch of the packs when you could go (50:43 - 50:48)
buy the singles in a couple week for a (50:46 - 50:50)
lot less because you're only going to (50:48 - 50:53)
pull one maybe two Shiny Pokemon cards (50:50 - 50:57)
in a pack very rarely you can pull two (50:53 - 50:57)
um5 cards Al together in the yeah 245 I (50:58 - 51:04)
think only 91 are actually like the set (51:01 - 51:07)
and then everything else is shinies and (51:04 - 51:10)
there's a few trainer like full art (51:07 - 51:14)
trainer cards um in the set so uh I (51:10 - 51:16)
think it's fun to open the pull rates (51:14 - 51:18)
are great so I don't know how many hits (51:16 - 51:20)
you got in your Elite Trainer block (51:18 - 51:23)
Steve but I got nine hits out of 11 (51:20 - 51:26)
packs that's great oh you got one did (51:23 - 51:28)
you get one of the Pokemon Center yeah (51:26 - 51:32)
yeah trainer boxes okay got it yeah um (51:28 - 51:34)
yeah I think I had six hits in nine (51:32 - 51:36)
packs I mean definitely a lot more than (51:34 - 51:38)
what you're seeing what you saw from (51:36 - 51:40)
Paradox Rift and what you'll probably (51:38 - 51:42)
see from the next set that comes out (51:40 - 51:44)
because the holiday sets they tend to (51:42 - 51:46)
put they tend to stack them a little bit (51:44 - 51:48)
more so you do get more hits in your (51:46 - 51:52)
packs than the regular sets um but I (51:48 - 51:54)
think it's been fun so far I think it's (51:52 - 51:56)
better than shining Fates (51:54 - 51:59)
personally um I do like the illustration (51:56 - 52:01)
rares the special illustration rares (51:59 - 52:03)
those are cool uh they didn't put very (52:01 - 52:05)
many of them in there though I will say (52:03 - 52:08)
there are three illustration rares and (52:05 - 52:11)
uh five total special illustration rares (52:08 - 52:13)
between trainers and and Pokemon so I do (52:11 - 52:16)
wish they had done more of those um (52:13 - 52:19)
because those are super fun but (52:16 - 52:20)
otherwise I think it's a pretty fun set (52:19 - 52:22)
it's good collectible set I'm not sure (52:20 - 52:24)
what's playable what's super playable in (52:22 - 52:26)
it I know there's uh (52:24 - 52:29)
there's um a chin poow which I think is (52:26 - 52:32)
pretty playable um there's a Mew there's (52:29 - 52:34)
a there's a shiny Mew which is obviously (52:32 - 52:36)
a full art and a special illustration (52:34 - 52:39)
rare I know those are playable um oh (52:36 - 52:41)
they also introduced a gold like a new (52:39 - 52:44)
type of gold card oh I saw that with the (52:41 - 52:47)
maridon yeah so they have they're golden (52:44 - 52:51)
turquoise or like golden teal um which (52:47 - 52:55)
is different I think it's a probably a (52:51 - 52:56)
uh you either love it or you hate it (52:55 - 52:57)
kind of (52:56 - 53:00)
situation with that one um but those are (52:57 - 53:03)
pretty those are cool for in my opinion (53:00 - 53:04)
and they have six of those in the set as (53:03 - 53:08)
well so good set overall um I think (53:04 - 53:11)
people will be pretty happy buying it uh (53:08 - 53:13)
a lot more chance of getting something (53:11 - 53:16)
getting a hit of of sorts (53:13 - 53:19)
so I I don't think the card prices for (53:16 - 53:22)
scarlet and violet are going to like (53:19 - 53:26)
dramatically increase anytime soon I (53:22 - 53:32)
mm no and I I I do (53:26 - 53:36)
wonder how much of I guess I I shouldn't (53:32 - 53:40)
say I wonder like I think we all have I (53:36 - 53:41)
think in (53:40 - 53:44)
hindsight and during it it was it was (53:41 - 53:46)
very obvious that the reason Pokemon (53:44 - 53:48)
cards jumped up so much in price was (53:46 - 53:50)
literally because of the (53:48 - 53:55)
pandemic um and people having extra (53:50 - 53:57)
money cuz they weren't going anywhere (53:55 - 54:00)
they were stuck at home right uh it (53:57 - 54:03)
probably also safe to say that Logan (54:00 - 54:06)
Paul did not help that situation at all (54:03 - 54:08)
in any (54:06 - 54:13)
way yes that's true but the thing is is (54:08 - 54:16)
that it's been very interesting to see (54:13 - 54:18)
how the Scarlet Violet era just has not (54:16 - 54:22)
kept up with the same price the same (54:18 - 54:25)
pricing as the older Generations maybe (54:22 - 54:27)
that will change once it gets closer to (54:25 - 54:32)
the end and uh it's just so much harder (54:27 - 54:34)
because the price of everything went up (54:32 - 54:36)
the price of all the products went up (54:34 - 54:38)
but then the cards themselves are (54:36 - 54:42)
decreasing in value so much quicker and (54:38 - 54:45)
so you know if you wait a few weeks it (54:42 - 54:48)
makes it tough to say oh go spend (54:45 - 54:52)
$100 on a couple Elite Trainer boxes but (54:48 - 54:54)
the most expensive card in the set is (54:52 - 54:56)
not worth $100 (54:54 - 54:59)
and you know and it is now right there's (54:56 - 55:00)
a Charizard in this (54:59 - 55:03)
set but to to be fair with that there (55:00 - 55:06)
was there's a Charizard in this set and (55:03 - 55:07)
typically a week before the set comes (55:06 - 55:10)
out the Distributors get the get their (55:07 - 55:12)
stuff and then some people are able to (55:10 - 55:14)
open stuff early right so you do see (55:12 - 55:17)
things pop up on eBay where people have (55:14 - 55:18)
opened cards a few days early or a week (55:17 - 55:20)
early or something and they pull the (55:18 - 55:23)
Charizard or they pull the whatever the (55:20 - 55:25)
popular card is and they go on eBay and (55:23 - 55:28)
put up there and earlier this week that (55:25 - 55:31)
Charizard was going for about $300 they (55:28 - 55:33)
were selling for about $300 prior to the (55:31 - 55:36)
set coming out today I checked it last (55:33 - 55:37)
night last night they were selling that (55:36 - 55:40)
Charizard is selling for anywhere (55:37 - 55:43)
between 150 and 160 bucks two days into (55:40 - 55:45)
the set being out that it's already (55:43 - 55:48)
dropped half you know and it will no no (55:45 - 55:52)
there's no uh doubt it'll drop to (55:48 - 55:54)
probably about a hundred bucks or less (55:52 - 55:57)
Within a month (55:54 - 56:00)
and you know it's not all about it's not (55:57 - 56:02)
obviously not all about money but if you (56:00 - 56:04)
are want to get the (56:02 - 56:06)
Charizard are you going to go and spend (56:04 - 56:09)
$100 on opening packs and maybe getting (56:06 - 56:11)
it or just spend $100 on the Charizard (56:09 - 56:13)
because that has dropped in value so (56:11 - 56:16)
quickly so you know it's not like it's (56:13 - 56:17)
not all it is kind of about money (56:16 - 56:19)
because you're buying this to collect (56:17 - 56:22)
the cards so if you can go buy the cards (56:19 - 56:25)
for cheaper than the product then you (56:22 - 56:28)
know it's hard to say go spend a bunch (56:25 - 56:31)
of money on the set um especially if (56:28 - 56:34)
it's not super if the cards aren't super (56:31 - 56:35)
competitive you know because if it's not (56:34 - 56:37)
like you could get a bunch of (56:35 - 56:40)
competitive stuff then it's also a bit (56:37 - 56:41)
tough to go buy packs to open when you (56:40 - 56:44)
can just buy singles yeah I mean that's (56:41 - 56:45)
always been the argument though right I (56:44 - 56:47)
mean singles have always been kind of (56:45 - 56:48)
the way to go if you're playing (56:47 - 56:50)
competitive rather than opening a bunch (56:48 - 56:52)
of packs just go buy the singles from (56:50 - 56:54)
that's always been the case it's not (56:52 - 56:56)
just the case in Pokemon right it's (56:54 - 56:57)
always been the case but even from a (56:56 - 56:59)
collector standpoint now it's just those (56:57 - 57:01)
these cards are not holding value now (56:59 - 57:03)
the cards in sword and shield era (57:01 - 57:06)
they're still holding value so that (57:03 - 57:08)
there's an Umbreon that's worth like 500 (57:06 - 57:10)
$600 that's still worth $500 $600 (57:08 - 57:12)
there's pretty much any of the (57:10 - 57:15)
evolutions are still worth is like 400 (57:12 - 57:16)
yeah they're north of $100 for all of (57:15 - 57:19)
the alt art Eevee evolutions they held (57:16 - 57:21)
their prices you know sun and moon era (57:19 - 57:23)
stuff they're still holding prices for a (57:21 - 57:24)
lot of those cards or have increased (57:23 - 57:28)
recently ion times um Scarlet Violet is (57:24 - 57:31)
not it's it's weird I guess what I'm (57:28 - 57:33)
hearing is just that the cards are (57:31 - 57:35)
slightly more accessible than they used (57:33 - 57:37)
to be I'm still kind of enjoying (57:35 - 57:39)
watching the online Market be decimated (57:37 - 57:43)
because it was not fun to watch all of (57:39 - 57:47)
the stampedes and violence that happened (57:43 - 57:50)
around the prices of Pokemon cards which (57:47 - 57:53)
we will talk more about (57:50 - 57:56)
but I don't know these cards they're it (57:53 - 57:58)
really depends on where you get your joy (57:56 - 58:00)
out of it if you're looking for a (57:58 - 58:03)
specific card either to collect or to (58:00 - 58:05)
play then yeah probably buying (58:03 - 58:09)
singles is still and kind of always has (58:05 - 58:10)
been the best way to go about it but (58:09 - 58:13)
also these cards are continually getting (58:10 - 58:17)
better in both in just sort of the (58:13 - 58:19)
enjoyment of opening a pack the art (58:17 - 58:20)
looks better (58:19 - 58:23)
the likelihood of finding a really cool (58:20 - 58:26)
card I feel like is than (58:23 - 58:30)
ever yep I totally agree I mean and I (58:26 - 58:32)
think the best thing you can do is like (58:30 - 58:34)
you could have a nice mixture of I like (58:32 - 58:36)
to open packs so I'll open a bunch of (58:34 - 58:39)
packs I will then go to my local card (58:36 - 58:42)
shop trade what cards I don't want I can (58:39 - 58:44)
you know trade for stuff I do want (58:42 - 58:45)
things like that so I mean it's (58:44 - 58:48)
definitely a nice mix and just the (58:45 - 58:52)
accessibility of the cards is great um I (58:48 - 58:54)
know people were worried with pal and (58:52 - 58:56)
Fates they were thinking oh no is this (58:54 - 58:57)
going to be like another shining Fates (58:56 - 59:00)
situation uh where it's impossible to (58:57 - 59:03)
get but I mean I can open up various (59:00 - 59:06)
apps for stores right now and go pick up (59:03 - 59:09)
the stuff within an hour I mean Best Buy (59:06 - 59:12)
Target Walmart the big box stores they (59:09 - 59:15)
all have it in stock there's not like a (59:12 - 59:17)
rush of it getting sold out which is I (59:15 - 59:22)
me this is Parton why the cards are not (59:17 - 59:24)
expensive because right I mean it's it's (59:22 - 59:26)
a it you know it that's how it goes I (59:24 - 59:28)
guess there things are more accessible (59:26 - 59:30)
they're they're printing more of it then (59:28 - 59:31)
there's more out there so they're (59:30 - 59:33)
they're not going to hold their value um (59:31 - 59:35)
which as a collector I actually I (59:33 - 59:37)
appreciate that because again I can go (59:35 - 59:40)
get cards or I can go buy Cards and it's (59:37 - 59:43)
not going to be ridiculous and wild for (59:40 - 59:46)
me to to go buy a card that I want I I (59:43 - 59:48)
actually enjoy the fact that the cards (59:46 - 59:52)
aren't like staying at 300 4400 $500 for (59:48 - 59:55)
you know these cards um yeah and Pokemon (59:52 - 59:57)
has never benefited (59:55 - 59:59)
monetarily directly from the secondhand (59:57 - 60:03)
Market benefited from the hype around it (59:59 - 60:05)
but clearly the hype around it is not (60:03 - 60:07)
where it used to be so I think what (60:05 - 60:09)
they're doing seems to be working where (60:07 - 60:11)
more people can actually go out and get (60:09 - 60:13)
the cards yeah I mean and you saw that (60:11 - 60:14)
from even shining Fates I was just (60:13 - 60:16)
having a conversation with someone about (60:14 - 60:18)
this the other day uh you're still able (60:16 - 60:20)
to find shining Fates in stores because (60:18 - 60:22)
they printed so much of it after people (60:20 - 60:24)
had like such a backlash to it being (60:22 - 60:25)
unavailable (60:24 - 60:27)
that two years later it's still sitting (60:25 - 60:29)
in stores because they were like oh well (60:27 - 60:31)
now we printed a bunch of it and (60:29 - 60:32)
everyone's like well we don't want we (60:31 - 60:33)
don't want it now you know it's two (60:32 - 60:37)
years old so it's just sitting uh yeah I (60:33 - 60:40)
mean like (60:37 - 60:44)
the the the overprinting (60:40 - 60:47)
is is nice for people who just want to (60:44 - 60:50)
walk in and buy Cards and it probably (60:47 - 60:52)
really helps with the the impulse buy (60:50 - 60:53)
because I (60:52 - 60:55)
think I mean that that I I feel like (60:53 - 60:57)
that is how a lot of people get back (60:55 - 60:59)
into Pokemon cards is like I'm going to (60:57 - 61:01)
impulse buy and now all of a sudden I'm (60:59 - 61:03)
I'm I'm back into this and I want to buy (61:01 - 61:06)
more and then when you hit that wall of (61:03 - 61:08)
like oh nothing's in stock I wanted to (61:06 - 61:10)
open up something tonight or this (61:08 - 61:13)
weekend and I got to go online and (61:10 - 61:15)
things are more expensive because it's (61:13 - 61:17)
hard to find then you just kind of fall (61:15 - 61:21)
out of it um I do think that's like a (61:17 - 61:22)
different conversation of what happened (61:21 - 61:25)
with the pandemic where people weren't I (61:22 - 61:27)
want to get back into this it was more (61:25 - 61:30)
how can I make money quickly kind of (61:27 - 61:32)
thing yeah there was a there was (61:30 - 61:35)
definitely a huge uptick in that with (61:32 - 61:40)
the uh pandemic um unfortunately but I (61:35 - 61:42)
think there's another conversation to be (61:40 - 61:45)
had about the TCG and Tik Tock shop (61:42 - 61:47)
feeling like it's (61:45 - 61:52)
shoving TCG down your throat every maybe (61:47 - 61:54)
I'm on that side of T maybe down your (61:52 - 61:56)
throat (61:54 - 61:59)
there are all I'm saying is there's (61:56 - 62:01)
whether you see it or not depending on (61:59 - 62:03)
your algorithm there's a lot of people (62:01 - 62:06)
that are selling you Pokemon cards on (62:03 - 62:09)
Tik Tock shop and cheaper I from what (62:06 - 62:10)
I've been told quite a bit cheaper I (62:09 - 62:12)
don't actually I stopped using Tik Tik (62:10 - 62:14)
Tok a while ago and so I haven't been a (62:12 - 62:16)
part seeing it but friends of mine have (62:14 - 62:20)
been buying cards on Tik Tok and for (62:16 - 62:22)
quite a bit cheaper than you can buy (62:20 - 62:26)
them in a store for has had a bunch of (62:22 - 62:28)
discounts going on for a very long time (62:26 - 62:30)
and I'm not quite sure how they're doing (62:28 - 62:32)
that I how that works I don't know why (62:30 - 62:34)
they're so cheap I don't know but it's (62:32 - 62:39)
making things quite cheap and it's it's (62:34 - 62:39)
weird I don't know why how they're (62:39 - 62:43)
selling booster packs for so much (62:41 - 62:46)
cheaper than other places but I don't (62:43 - 62:48)
understand how like how even like um the (62:46 - 62:49)
smaller card shops are doing it either (62:48 - 62:53)
though you know the prices all went up (62:49 - 62:54)
the Distributors did not lower their (62:53 - 62:56)
price prices they raised them when (62:54 - 62:59)
Scarlet Violet came out and the shops (62:56 - 63:01)
are still selling them for the same (62:59 - 63:04)
lower prices as they used to sell like (63:01 - 63:08)
all the older stuff for so I don't know (63:04 - 63:10)
if we're going to like in the next in (63:08 - 63:12)
the coming couple of years either (63:10 - 63:14)
they're going to shift away from having (63:12 - 63:16)
a lot of Pokemon stuff the these smaller (63:14 - 63:19)
shops or they're going to either raise (63:16 - 63:20)
their prices or they're going to go out (63:19 - 63:23)
of business but they're selling at what (63:20 - 63:27)
seems like not even a profit for them (63:23 - 63:29)
which is very odd to me it is weird (63:27 - 63:32)
because like a lot of the card shops (63:29 - 63:35)
don't really make money on (63:32 - 63:38)
selling booster packs they make money on (63:35 - 63:40)
like Friday Night (63:38 - 63:42)
Magic right yeah that's true I guess (63:40 - 63:43)
it's just dep on where you're really (63:42 - 63:46)
getting your money from so that's that's (63:43 - 63:47)
the confusing part about like the Tik (63:46 - 63:49)
Tock shop is like they're selling it for (63:47 - 63:52)
so cheap and like sure they're buying (63:49 - 63:55)
bulk to like save money but (63:52 - 63:58)
but I feel like after shipping your (63:55 - 64:01)
margins are just so thin MH it's like is (63:58 - 64:04)
it is it worth (64:01 - 64:07)
that because like a a card shop yeah (64:04 - 64:09)
they can sell booster packs in between (64:07 - 64:11)
things but they're (64:09 - 64:13)
still they're still making most of their (64:11 - 64:17)
overhead from like events or tournaments (64:13 - 64:21)
or just yeah other stuff they have other (64:17 - 64:22)
thing yeah they have other things they (64:21 - 64:24)
can sell they're not just selling one (64:22 - 64:28)
one type of product yeah I I don't I (64:24 - 64:31)
don't know um couldn't tell you I have (64:28 - 64:34)
no idea how it works honestly ien too (64:31 - 64:35)
into (64:34 - 64:38)
it uh I we thought this we thought this (64:35 - 64:40)
Saga was over but it will it will never (64:38 - 64:45)
end van go will haunt us (64:40 - 64:45)
forever this is off Pokey Beach uh they (64:47 - 64:55)
they've been they've been following this (64:52 - 64:58)
uh for a while here uh titled van go (64:55 - 65:01)
Museum fires employees for embezzling (64:58 - 65:03)
during Pokemon collaboration new details (65:01 - 65:05)
emerge the Dutch (65:03 - 65:09)
newspaper het Peru I probably said that (65:05 - 65:11)
very wrong has learned that at least (65:09 - 65:14)
four employees AV van go Museum was (65:11 - 65:16)
fired last month due to embezzling (65:14 - 65:18)
during the October Pokemon collaboration (65:16 - 65:20)
the museum did not say how many (65:18 - 65:23)
employees were involved but the (65:20 - 65:25)
newspaper reports that at least four (65:23 - 65:26)
were terminated including security (65:25 - 65:29)
guards cashiers and even a member of the (65:26 - 65:32)
cloak room staff one of the employees (65:29 - 65:36)
worked for the museum for 25 years in a (65:32 - 65:38)
statement to the newspaper the van go (65:36 - 65:41)
Museum confirms quote some employees (65:38 - 65:44)
from operational Services end quote did (65:41 - 65:46)
not adhere to the procedures of code and (65:44 - 65:49)
contact expected of Staff however the (65:46 - 65:53)
museum regarded this as an isolated (65:49 - 65:56)
incident uh the newspaper learned that (65:53 - 65:58)
one fired employee embezzled an entire (65:56 - 66:01)
box of the Pikachu promo cards other (65:58 - 66:04)
employees gave Insider information to (66:01 - 66:06)
scalpers so they would know when the (66:04 - 66:09)
Pokemon van go merchandise would be in (66:06 - 66:12)
stock the newspaper mistakely reports uh (66:09 - 66:16)
this as the cards would be in stock but (66:12 - 66:18)
corrected that it was the the (66:16 - 66:20)
merchandise in general uh the museum (66:18 - 66:21)
would stock the merchandise at random (66:20 - 66:23)
times to give visitors a chance to buy (66:21 - 66:25)
meaning the inside information allowed (66:23 - 66:27)
scalpers to purchase their (66:25 - 66:29)
Administration tickets exactly at the (66:27 - 66:30)
right (66:29 - 66:33)
times um and there's more here if you (66:30 - 66:37)
want to read on Pokey Beach but I think (66:33 - 66:41)
that gives you the gist of what was (66:37 - 66:41)
happening yeah I don't know I guess I'm (66:42 - 66:49)
not surprised by this um just because of (66:44 - 66:54)
how Wild all of that was at the time um (66:49 - 66:57)
this isn't n really surprising to me uh (66:54 - 66:59)
I saw there was also information about (66:57 - 67:02)
people like employees were buying were (66:59 - 67:05)
buying things prior to the store being (67:02 - 67:07)
open or something so it was in the (67:05 - 67:09)
article as well there was talk about (67:07 - 67:10)
people were buying stuff or maybe (67:09 - 67:12)
selling stuff before so there was (67:10 - 67:15)
receipts that would show this item was (67:12 - 67:17)
purchased at 8:45 in the morning when (67:15 - 67:19)
the store didn't open until 9:00 a.m. (67:17 - 67:22)
and I guess that was also a violation of (67:19 - 67:25)
sorts um which I don't know I mean I've (67:22 - 67:26)
worked in places where people bought (67:25 - 67:27)
stuff before the store opened because (67:26 - 67:29)
they're working at the store and so they (67:27 - 67:31)
but I this is probably a special (67:29 - 67:35)
situation since it was such a in demand (67:31 - 67:38)
item yeah but I can't say I'm like super (67:35 - 67:42)
surprised it's a bummer it's sad but (67:38 - 67:43)
it's (67:42 - 67:45)
just there was a lot that went on in (67:43 - 67:47)
that time when that Pikachu card came (67:45 - 67:51)
out there was it's a whole mess yeah (67:47 - 67:53)
huge huge mess (67:51 - 67:56)
so one of the other things that this (67:53 - 67:57)
article quotes is saying when you make (67:56 - 67:59)
minimum wage some will (67:57 - 68:02)
fold that being one of the reasons some (67:59 - 68:05)
of the employees probably participated (68:02 - 68:09)
in some of this which yeah and then (68:05 - 68:11)
actually the the funny part at the (68:09 - 68:14)
bottom I thought not funny they added (68:11 - 68:17)
photos from the anime that made it (68:14 - 68:20)
funny was that when they ended the card (68:17 - 68:22)
promotion it was because there was a (68:20 - 68:24)
robbery outside the building by a buch (68:22 - 68:26)
of 16-year-olds on bikes (68:24 - 68:30)
yeah yeah so and the people that got (68:26 - 68:34)
robbed were scalpers apparently yeah uh (68:30 - 68:39)
so it's just a whole mess yeah it it's (68:34 - 68:41)
definitely there was a scalper that said (68:39 - 68:43)
quote there was always a line of people (68:41 - 68:45)
outside the museum waiting to buy the (68:43 - 68:46)
promos and merchandise a lot of (68:45 - 68:49)
foreigners and kids were going in 5 10 (68:46 - 68:51)
20 times a day kids could get in for (68:49 - 68:53)
free so they would sell us the promo for (68:51 - 68:56)
70 to30 and then go back in to get go (68:53 - 68:58)
back in for free and get us more promos (68:56 - 69:01)
I went in 30 to 50 times myself to get (68:58 - 69:02)
the (69:01 - 69:04)
card those (69:02 - 69:06)
kids yeah (69:04 - 69:09)
seriously seriously I think it's I mean (69:06 - 69:12)
when I was a kid it was like you go to (69:09 - 69:14)
Lemonade Stand you go to the store you (69:12 - 69:16)
buy a 12-pack of soda for three bucks (69:14 - 69:19)
and then you sell the cans for 50 cents (69:16 - 69:21)
and yeah no what what what it was here (69:19 - 69:23)
was when I was a kid you would go to the (69:21 - 69:25)
dut place and had a big bucket like (69:23 - 69:28)
paint siiz bucket of day donuts for $5 (69:25 - 69:31)
and sell them for two bucks each in high (69:28 - 69:32)
school (69:31 - 69:35)
wow dang that's the high profit margins (69:32 - 69:38)
on that you put that not high as going (69:35 - 69:39)
into the van go Museum and coming out (69:38 - 69:43)
for zero but getting 70 EUR out of it (69:39 - 69:45)
yeah that's pretty good that's pretty (69:43 - 69:46)
good I will say when I was in Middle (69:45 - 69:48)
School my friend and I had a thing where (69:46 - 69:50)
we uh we basically invented a (69:48 - 69:53)
multi-level marketing situation where we (69:50 - 69:55)
basic basically just tell people like (69:53 - 69:57)
hey once you like hit a certain level (69:55 - 69:58)
you can start asking for things too and (69:57 - 70:01)
so if you do things you get up and you (69:58 - 70:02)
you level up and once you get to a (70:01 - 70:05)
certain level you you know get stuff so (70:02 - 70:08)
you know there it happens you whether (70:05 - 70:09)
not whether you're when you're a kid and (70:08 - 70:11)
you look you find that opportunity and (70:09 - 70:13)
then you start to realize oh this isn't (70:11 - 70:16)
a nice these aren't good things to do (70:13 - 70:18)
shouldn't do these things sometimes you (70:16 - 70:23)
accidentally start MLM it happens it (70:18 - 70:24)
happens (70:23 - 70:26)
I don't I (70:24 - 70:28)
don't I I think we put a lot of the (70:26 - 70:30)
blame on (70:28 - 70:33)
Pokemon uh when we initially talked (70:30 - 70:37)
about this and like why doesn't the why (70:33 - 70:39)
doesn't the museum hire more security or (70:37 - 70:42)
why doesn't the museum handled this (70:39 - 70:45)
but it seems the museum was in on this (70:42 - 70:48)
obviously now that but it was two (70:45 - 70:49)
different situations because when we (70:48 - 70:52)
were commenting on things back in (70:49 - 70:55)
October uh and there's was that the last (70:52 - 70:57)
time I was on this show I feel like van (70:55 - 70:59)
go Pikachu is not my thing for when I (70:57 - 71:01)
come on the show (70:59 - 71:03)
um we were talking about the people that (71:01 - 71:05)
couldn't that were like scrambling to (71:03 - 71:07)
buy stuff right there was that video (71:05 - 71:09)
that came out where people were rushing (71:07 - 71:12)
the museum shop basically climbing all (71:09 - 71:16)
over each other yeah to to buy the stuff (71:12 - 71:18)
and at that point it seemed like well (71:16 - 71:19)
they probably need more (71:18 - 71:21)
security yeah know they probably need to (71:19 - 71:23)
organize this a little bit better um I (71:21 - 71:25)
feel like this is a little separate of (71:23 - 71:26)
that because it sounds like that was (71:25 - 71:28)
much more coordinated whereas what we (71:26 - 71:29)
saw in that video was there was no (71:28 - 71:31)
coordination to that yeah that was the (71:29 - 71:33)
first and from my understanding after (71:31 - 71:36)
the first day they got it under control (71:33 - 71:38)
and then but now we're reading that two (71:36 - 71:40)
security guards were telling scalpers (71:38 - 71:41)
when things were getting restocked and (71:40 - 71:44)
when they should show up yeah I mean (71:41 - 71:47)
they saw the opportunity (71:44 - 71:49)
and and they went with what was (71:47 - 71:51)
happening yeah I mean they got kids (71:49 - 71:54)
going in there 30 to wait cuz the kids (71:51 - 71:55)
have to go through the thing to get (71:54 - 71:57)
right they're going in for free to they (71:55 - 71:59)
had to go to the end to get the card at (71:57 - 72:01)
the end and all that stuff right that's (71:59 - 72:03)
what it turned into right so these (72:01 - 72:05)
people are seeing the the employees are (72:03 - 72:08)
seeing Kid the same kid go into the (72:05 - 72:10)
museum 30 to 50 times yeah I feel like (72:08 - 72:12)
maybe after the third or fourth time you (72:10 - 72:15)
kind of catch on so yeah I don't I don't (72:12 - 72:16)
know you catch on after the first day (72:15 - 72:18)
when there are people climbing over each (72:16 - 72:21)
other trying to buy this product right (72:18 - 72:24)
but like it's so I don't know if this is (72:21 - 72:25)
how it was for you when you worked at (72:24 - 72:27)
the Apple Store Steve but when the (72:25 - 72:30)
iPhone was early with the 3G 3GS the (72:27 - 72:32)
early iPhones we'd have people you could (72:30 - 72:36)
only buy five because people were buying (72:32 - 72:37)
them and then they would sell them (72:36 - 72:39)
overseas because they weren't really (72:37 - 72:40)
they weren't readily available they (72:39 - 72:42)
weren't released yet yeah they weren't (72:40 - 72:43)
released and so they were selling them (72:42 - 72:45)
for three four five times as much as (72:43 - 72:48)
they actually cost overseas um we'd have (72:45 - 72:50)
people that would come in they would buy (72:48 - 72:52)
five iPhones they would leave they would (72:50 - 72:54)
put on a different outfit and put on (72:52 - 72:56)
like a hat I literally I and they would (72:54 - 72:59)
come back in an hour later and I (72:56 - 73:02)
remember calling someone out like I was (72:59 - 73:03)
like I just helped I I know I just (73:02 - 73:05)
helped you but you you have like a (73:03 - 73:07)
mustache on now or something like (73:05 - 73:10)
literally changing disguising themselves (73:07 - 73:11)
to buy extra (73:10 - 73:15)
iPhones uh you know once that happens a (73:11 - 73:17)
few times you kind of catch on so it's (73:15 - 73:19)
like they had to have just (73:17 - 73:22)
been you know this the security I guess (73:19 - 73:24)
or whoever it was just seeing these kids (73:22 - 73:26)
come in 30 times or whatever and I mean (73:24 - 73:28)
it sounds like it was people throughout (73:26 - 73:30)
the entirety of the museum in all sorts (73:28 - 73:32)
of roles cuz they did say four people (73:30 - 73:34)
were fired but they didn't say that (73:32 - 73:36)
there were only four people involved I (73:34 - 73:39)
think the article did say that so I I do (73:36 - 73:41)
wonder how many people did not want to (73:39 - 73:43)
say how many employees were involved (73:41 - 73:45)
yeah how were a part of all of it and if (73:43 - 73:47)
it was just kind of the higher ups maybe (73:45 - 73:49)
that like the people that or whatever or (73:47 - 73:51)
whoever I don't know who but it's (73:49 - 73:53)
interesting that only four people got (73:51 - 73:55)
fired if there were more people involved (73:53 - 73:57)
in it they were probably the four people (73:55 - 73:59)
who did things that were specifically (73:57 - 74:01)
against written rules and predetermined (73:59 - 74:04)
rules this is a complicated situation (74:01 - 74:06)
they probably didn't have rules yeah (74:04 - 74:08)
like take a box of the cards take a box (74:06 - 74:10)
yeah I mean I still think there's a lot (74:08 - 74:12)
of blame to be put on the Pokemon (74:10 - 74:15)
company that like the easiest thing they (74:12 - 74:17)
could have done is just print more (74:15 - 74:21)
cards um which I think they're doing (74:17 - 74:24)
right I think the cards are coming back (74:21 - 74:27)
another reprint of cards yeah in in (74:24 - 74:29)
certain shops in the in the Netherlands (74:27 - 74:31)
will be able to get them and then give (74:29 - 74:34)
them out with purchases or something (74:31 - 74:36)
like that um but it seems like it's (74:34 - 74:38)
specifically there in the (74:36 - 74:42)
Netherlands also like when you when you (74:38 - 74:46)
when when you pay people minimum wage (74:42 - 74:49)
and they can barely afford to pay rent (74:46 - 74:52)
or get groceries they just don't care I (74:49 - 74:55)
remember when the I Choose You movie was (74:52 - 74:58)
in theaters and that was the what what (74:55 - 74:59)
card they they were handing out a (74:58 - 75:00)
special Pikachu card for yeah it was (74:59 - 75:03)
Ash's hat Pikachu Ash had Pikachu promo (75:00 - 75:06)
card yeah and I remember walking out of (75:03 - 75:10)
the theater and uh there was a whole (75:06 - 75:13)
stack of those Pikachu cards on where (75:10 - 75:15)
the guy takes your ticket I don't know (75:13 - 75:16)
what that's called where they like check (75:15 - 75:19)
your ticket to let you in and I watched (75:16 - 75:22)
a dad just grab the entire stack and (75:19 - 75:24)
kept just grabbed it and kept in as he (75:22 - 75:27)
left the the thing (75:24 - 75:29)
and like yeah that's a terrible thing (75:27 - 75:31)
for that person to do and and he should (75:29 - 75:34)
feel bad although he was very confused (75:31 - 75:36)
during the movie (75:34 - 75:39)
why the Pokemon said their own names and (75:36 - 75:40)
he made that very clear when the credits (75:39 - 75:42)
rolled he's like I didn't understand why (75:40 - 75:44)
they all said their names um which is (75:42 - 75:48)
very memorable (75:44 - 75:50)
but the employees working at the movie (75:48 - 75:52)
theater getting paid what like 725 an (75:50 - 75:54)
hour they they don't they don't care (75:52 - 75:56)
like who cares if the carts go missing (75:54 - 75:58)
like that doesn't come out of their (75:56 - 76:02)
paycheck yeah yeah that's true um those (75:58 - 76:05)
cards are worth about 10 to 20 bucks a (76:02 - 76:07)
piece now that those I Choose You (76:05 - 76:09)
Pikachu cap cards so I'm sure he didn't (76:07 - 76:11)
sell it I'm sure they're in a landfill (76:09 - 76:13)
now probably it's just that there are (76:11 - 76:15)
people who well and then the obviously (76:13 - 76:17)
the felt hat Pikachu is still worth a (76:15 - 76:20)
lot of money but um you know it's like (76:17 - 76:22)
people don't think it's like oh whatever (76:20 - 76:24)
just cards will just just going to print (76:22 - 76:25)
more of them or whatever but then you go (76:24 - 76:26)
and look and it's like oh well if that (76:25 - 76:28)
person just took a stack of cards that's (76:26 - 76:31)
possibly like $2,000 they're about to (76:28 - 76:32)
make like depending on how many cards (76:31 - 76:36)
are in that stack or whatever and it's (76:32 - 76:38)
just I don't know it's like a bummer to (76:36 - 76:41)
see that stuff happen and obviously like (76:38 - 76:42)
the employees are like well whatever (76:41 - 76:46)
it's not our stuff but it's like there (76:42 - 76:48)
are kids who were like want to come get (76:46 - 76:51)
that card yeah it's a tricky situation (76:48 - 76:54)
in a few ways but also they (76:51 - 76:55)
want that (76:54 - 76:57)
too they're not paid enough to get into (76:55 - 76:59)
a fight with some guy who just grabbed (76:57 - 77:02)
100 cards yeah right like e like yeah if (76:59 - 77:05)
you if you're the 16-year-old checking (77:02 - 77:09)
tickets and you see a grown man grab 20 (77:05 - 77:12)
sealed cards like what are you gonna do (77:09 - 77:14)
wrestle him down you don't get paid (77:12 - 77:16)
enough for that yeah well I don't know (77:14 - 77:17)
in some like in places you're not even (77:16 - 77:19)
allow like yeah you're not supposed to (77:17 - 77:21)
you're not even allowed to like you have (77:19 - 77:23)
to let only security because otherwise (77:21 - 77:26)
is I think like you can get sued like if (77:23 - 77:27)
you hurt the person in the on the (77:26 - 77:29)
premises then like they can sue the (77:27 - 77:31)
company for that or whatever unless it's (77:29 - 77:34)
like security so in some cases you just (77:31 - 77:37)
have to let them go (77:34 - 77:39)
um it's probably the safest decision (77:37 - 77:40)
honestly if somebody is stealing (77:39 - 77:42)
something to probably not chase after (77:40 - 77:46)
them anyways but still a (77:42 - 77:49)
bummer well we'll we'll Circle back in a (77:46 - 77:51)
month when we'll find out even more (77:49 - 77:52)
about the van go (77:51 - 77:55)
Pikachu (77:52 - 77:55)
hopefully hopefully this is kind of (77:57 - 78:02)
it yeah I mean like I think these events (78:00 - 78:05)
are cool I think having a card to go (78:02 - 78:06)
with the event is (78:05 - 78:09)
cool hopefully they learn to do this (78:06 - 78:11)
better in the future because I think (78:09 - 78:15)
this event was ruined for a lot of (78:11 - 78:17)
people yeah it was a really fantastic (78:15 - 78:19)
event that everybody was really excited (78:17 - 78:22)
about when it first opened (78:19 - 78:25)
but but it was a mess it was shortlived (78:22 - 78:27)
excitement though we only found out (78:25 - 78:28)
about it like a few days before it (78:27 - 78:29)
started and then it immediately turned (78:28 - 78:31)
into chaos and it was like oh well never (78:29 - 78:34)
mind this isn't as fun as it was should (78:31 - 78:36)
have (78:34 - 78:36)
been still real pretty art though yeah (78:37 - 78:42)
art is (78:40 - 78:42)
good uh okay let's wrap up with some (78:44 - 78:49)
Pokemon Go (78:47 - 78:51)
News nothing too exciting first off (78:49 - 78:55)
there is a visual change to Pokemon go (78:51 - 78:59)
um I believe that what that's exciting a (78:55 - 79:01)
visual change to the game it's been like (78:59 - 79:03)
the same for eight (79:01 - 79:05)
years um I believe that's being tested (79:03 - 79:09)
in New Zealand right now uh all all the (79:05 - 79:12)
Pokemon Go website says is visual (79:09 - 79:14)
changes in the (79:12 - 79:16)
game in the game the Pokemon go map (79:14 - 79:20)
including encounter streams are changing (79:16 - 79:21)
it looks like they're based off biomes (79:20 - 79:23)
so you'll kind of know what biome you're (79:21 - 79:25)
in when you encounter the (79:23 - 79:27)
Pokemon uh I've seen a couple (79:25 - 79:30)
screenshots it's it looks cool yeah some (79:27 - 79:31)
of them look really (79:30 - 79:35)
cool yeah um I think it's funny you're (79:31 - 79:36)
saying in in case you don't know what (79:35 - 79:38)
biome you're in like oh I'm at the beach (79:36 - 79:40)
and there there happens to be a beach (79:38 - 79:41)
scene in the (79:40 - 79:44)
game sometimes you don't know when (79:41 - 79:46)
you're when you're on the outskirts of a (79:44 - 79:48)
city sometimes you don't know yeah I am (79:46 - 79:50)
in actually I live in a situation like (79:48 - 79:53)
that where it's like right between two (79:50 - 79:55)
different bi it's like City versus I (79:53 - 79:56)
don't know whatever the there's one (79:55 - 79:57)
that's like Waterfront or something (79:56 - 79:59)
something like that so it changes it can (79:57 - 80:02)
yeah definitely change but still I just (79:59 - 80:03)
you know you're outside hopefully you (80:02 - 80:05)
have some idea maybe of what biome (80:03 - 80:08)
you're possibly in uh I don't have this (80:05 - 80:10)
in the show notes but they like redid (80:08 - 80:14)
the news tab or whatever in the (80:10 - 80:17)
game how do you feel about that I think (80:14 - 80:19)
it I think it's (80:17 - 80:22)
better like how it's organized better (80:19 - 80:25)
too just it's a little that's the right (80:22 - 80:27)
way to go about it I think it's better (80:25 - 80:29)
to question mark there's that little bit (80:27 - 80:32)
of hesitation where we're not quite sure (80:29 - 80:36)
I think I just I did like how before the (80:32 - 80:39)
middle tab was just really (80:36 - 80:43)
your uh the tasks that you had and now (80:39 - 80:45)
it like just it's like oh there's a (80:43 - 80:47)
bunch of other information right there (80:45 - 80:51)
front and center now um and then the (80:47 - 80:53)
events tab when there's not something (80:51 - 80:54)
there's not a timed research happening (80:53 - 80:56)
there's just a lot of empty space (80:54 - 80:57)
because it just shows you what the next (80:56 - 81:00)
event is yeah so it's like oh there's (80:57 - 81:03)
like I don't know it's a little (81:00 - 81:06)
confusing it's a little visually (81:03 - 81:08)
confusing although I do really like how (81:06 - 81:10)
when there're is an event going on you (81:08 - 81:12)
can actually see what's happening just (81:10 - 81:14)
right there without having to scroll (81:12 - 81:16)
past all of the descriptions of the (81:14 - 81:19)
bonuses that are active yes I do like (81:16 - 81:20)
that and I do like how quickly you can (81:19 - 81:22)
see how much time is left in an event (81:20 - 81:24)
just because of that because you're not (81:22 - 81:26)
having to scroll through a bunch so I (81:24 - 81:28)
think overall I do think it's better it (81:26 - 81:31)
just was quite jarring when I open the (81:28 - 81:33)
my app and was like whoa what is (81:31 - 81:35)
happening here no I'm I'm looking at it (81:33 - 81:39)
now and I do I do think it's better uh I (81:35 - 81:42)
also it was I I'm the one I'm the person (81:39 - 81:45)
that has like the the claim rewards like (81:42 - 81:47)
stacked up to like a 100 yeah because (81:45 - 81:48)
it'll pop up and then I'll run away and (81:47 - 81:50)
I'll never catch it um and they made (81:48 - 81:52)
that like button smaller which was like (81:50 - 81:55)
nice yeah it's yeah it's a lot Slimmer (81:52 - 81:59)
at the top now or not as tall at the top (81:55 - 82:01)
and they have coins gyms your streak and (81:59 - 82:05)
showcases all in the same spot which is (82:01 - 82:08)
great it's almost like maybe there (82:05 - 82:10)
should be a fourth tab there's three (82:08 - 82:12)
tabs because I see what you guys are (82:10 - 82:15)
saying where the today is like a lot (82:12 - 82:19)
bigger than events but I don't think (82:15 - 82:22)
that daily activities should be under (82:19 - 82:23)
events (82:22 - 82:25)
no I feel like those should be under (82:23 - 82:28)
something labeled today but maybe maybe (82:25 - 82:30)
honestly the daily research should be in (82:28 - 82:32)
its own (82:30 - 82:35)
tab like the research the research (82:32 - 82:37)
resarch tasks yeah should be in their (82:35 - 82:40)
own tab right um yeah because like Steve (82:37 - 82:41)
the ones that are stacked up those are (82:40 - 82:43)
not from (82:41 - 82:47)
today years worth of tasks oh I'm sure (82:43 - 82:49)
they go way way past Korea I'm sure (82:47 - 82:52)
there's some Korean hat Eevees in there (82:49 - 82:54)
or something (82:52 - 82:56)
um I I think it was just when they (82:54 - 82:58)
introduced it there wasn't a timed (82:56 - 83:01)
research happening and so when you went (82:58 - 83:03)
over to the events tab it was just like (83:01 - 83:06)
Porygon Community Day classic was like (83:03 - 83:07)
the only thing there and it was just all (83:06 - 83:10)
completely empty and it was it was like (83:07 - 83:12)
well yeah I could see why it would be (83:10 - 83:14)
empty for some people like I have the (83:12 - 83:17)
Expedition thing oh yeah you bought the (83:14 - 83:20)
tickets yeah well I was gifted that one (83:17 - 83:22)
um I did get taken treasure I did buy (83:20 - 83:23)
that myself for (83:22 - 83:26)
the5 I just have the Community Day (83:23 - 83:28)
chansy on my screen right now your very (83:26 - 83:31)
empty yeah very empty screen can't see (83:28 - 83:33)
my screen but I have the taken treasure (83:31 - 83:35)
one as well right now you know you know (83:33 - 83:38)
the reason why I bought taken treasure (83:35 - 83:41)
is literally if I'm going to be forced (83:38 - 83:46)
to do Team Rocket I want more rewards (83:41 - 83:49)
like I like that was it like if like I (83:46 - 83:52)
hate Team Rockets so much that I'm GNA (83:49 - 83:55)
spend (83:52 - 83:57)
$5 and I'm going to (83:55 - 84:00)
unlock they really got you there they (83:57 - 84:03)
did they did I cannot whatever the like (84:00 - 84:08)
get from level 45 to 46 has ruined my (84:03 - 84:10)
enjoyment of anything Team Rocket (84:08 - 84:14)
related you had to do so many battles to (84:10 - 84:17)
just level up and it was a nightmare but (84:14 - 84:21)
it's easy I don't know I haven't had a (84:17 - 84:24)
challenge with battling Team Rocket in (84:21 - 84:26)
years not since the first week the (84:24 - 84:29)
bosses came out yeah I don't I don't (84:26 - 84:32)
know I agree with with Steve I mean I'm (84:29 - 84:34)
also one of those people who it's like (84:32 - 84:36)
oh I can like I really like having like (84:34 - 84:38)
the research task like of some kind of (84:36 - 84:40)
like research thing to do while playing (84:38 - 84:42)
the game and so I know a lot of people (84:40 - 84:43)
are like I hate that they keep adding (84:42 - 84:45)
these $2 tickets in for blah blah blah (84:43 - 84:46)
and I'm just like no I'm good with it (84:45 - 84:48)
because like oh I like having something (84:46 - 84:50)
to do I just don't have to pay for (84:48 - 84:53)
something to do I just but like I'm like (84:50 - 84:55)
yeah I mean sure if it was not if you (84:53 - 84:57)
didn't have to pay for it but like you (84:55 - 85:00)
do and so I do (84:57 - 85:03)
like no one in listening is surprised (85:00 - 85:06)
that you pay for each one poppy Steve (85:03 - 85:07)
you spend more money on Pokemon stuff (85:06 - 85:09)
than I do I don't even know why people (85:07 - 85:11)
are always calling me out for spending (85:09 - 85:13)
money on stuff you have like $1,500 (85:11 - 85:15)
worth of pokeballs behind (85:13 - 85:19)
you I like them a lot I think they're (85:15 - 85:22)
great some of the YouTube shorts paid (85:19 - 85:24)
for their own pokeballs they made enough (85:22 - 85:27)
ad Revenue it was like they're free at (85:24 - 85:28)
that (85:27 - 85:31)
point not all of them some of (85:28 - 85:34)
them (85:31 - 85:36)
um yeah I mean like I think I think the (85:34 - 85:39)
combination of like Shadow Kyogre Shadow (85:36 - 85:41)
ho oh coming back at the same time I do (85:39 - 85:48)
like the pose that they had um (85:41 - 85:50)
so I think really this is the only money (85:48 - 85:53)
I've spent in January is $5 (85:50 - 85:56)
um everything else I either skipped or (85:53 - 85:58)
was gifted to me by somebody on my (85:56 - 86:01)
friends list which is like I can't stop (85:58 - 86:03)
that from happening you can actually (86:01 - 86:06)
there's a setting oh okay look no no (86:03 - 86:08)
one's turning that setting on if people (86:06 - 86:09)
want to gift me that's fine I'll take (86:08 - 86:13)
the gift (86:09 - 86:15)
I like I I I've definitely been in the (86:13 - 86:18)
position where I've been with people and (86:15 - 86:20)
it's going to be like a Pokemon go heavy (86:18 - 86:24)
day and I I have gifted them the like (86:20 - 86:27)
ticket uh and maybe that's like the (86:24 - 86:29)
selfishness of me of like oh if they (86:27 - 86:31)
have the gifted ticket they'll play (86:29 - 86:33)
longer with me and it's like they'll (86:31 - 86:35)
actually play they'll play (86:33 - 86:38)
more but it could just be the feeling of (86:35 - 86:40)
they'll get more enjoyment out of the (86:38 - 86:44)
day that's a generous feeling yeah again (86:40 - 86:46)
I said this last (86:44 - 86:49)
week I I don't think the N Niantic is (86:46 - 86:53)
boosting tickets to make up for loss (86:49 - 86:56)
Revenue I I I I think that's a very (86:53 - 86:57)
narrow way of looking at things I think (86:56 - 86:59)
they're I think they're doing this (86:57 - 87:00)
because they would have always done this (86:59 - 87:02)
whether remote raid passes were a dollar (87:00 - 87:04)
or $2 dollar unlimited or notlimited I (87:02 - 87:06)
think this was always coming to the game (87:04 - 87:08)
um because it's just another Revenue (87:06 - 87:11)
source for them (87:08 - 87:11)
and I think (87:11 - 87:17)
it's I think it's easier to do that (87:14 - 87:19)
gifting that I just explained when (87:17 - 87:21)
you're playing with people versus (87:19 - 87:24)
like I I think that's a lot harder of a (87:21 - 87:28)
of a cell when it comes to raiding and (87:24 - 87:30)
this is coming from somebody who who (87:28 - 87:32)
does a lot of well I don't do a lot of (87:30 - 87:35)
raids um I play a lot of Pokemon go but (87:32 - 87:38)
like if somebody was like hey join this (87:35 - 87:40)
dark cry (87:38 - 87:44)
raid I would almost always say no like I (87:40 - 87:45)
don't want to spend a dollar on dark cry (87:44 - 87:47)
I don't want to spend $2 I have three (87:45 - 87:49)
shiny dark cry like I don't care about a (87:47 - 87:51)
hundo I don't care about a shiny hundo (87:49 - 87:54)
like like the only way I think I would (87:51 - 87:56)
like join that dark cry is if the person (87:54 - 87:58)
who's asking me doesn't have a dark cry (87:56 - 87:59)
and they're like I need help with that (87:58 - 88:01)
dark cry yeah that's the thing that's (87:59 - 88:03)
when I join raids too when somebody (88:01 - 88:05)
really wants to catch the Pokemon and (88:03 - 88:08)
actually might not have one (88:05 - 88:12)
yet same but but like I I'll probably (88:08 - 88:15)
never do a dark cry raid again just like (88:12 - 88:17)
I just no need to and there there are (88:15 - 88:19)
even worse like dark cry is actually (88:17 - 88:21)
kind of a good Pokemon to do (88:19 - 88:24)
like let's bring up the reggies who I (88:21 - 88:28)
will like never need to do a re reg ice (88:24 - 88:30)
ever in my life or like a Reggie gigas I (88:28 - 88:34)
have 40 re iice in my storage right now (88:30 - 88:37)
and it took me 40 red iice to get a (88:34 - 88:40)
shiny Reed ice in Pokemon go and it (88:37 - 88:41)
barely looks any different and I never (88:40 - 88:45)
want to see reg I again in my life who (88:41 - 88:48)
pays more for Pokemon go now Pokemon go (88:45 - 88:50)
I will say but Pokemon in general it's (88:48 - 88:54)
Steve that's true (88:50 - 88:56)
uh this is like one of my this is our (88:54 - 88:58)
last bit of Pokemon good news this is (88:56 - 88:59)
probably one of my favorite events they (88:58 - 89:01)
do every year which is the Lunar New (88:59 - 89:02)
Year event um they're going to be (89:01 - 89:05)
introducing draa draa also will be shiny (89:02 - 89:08)
right away there will be an increased (89:05 - 89:10)
lucky chance increased chance for Lucky (89:08 - 89:12)
Pokemon while trading increased chance (89:10 - 89:15)
to become lucky friends uh additional (89:12 - 89:18)
candy for nice great or excellent throws (89:15 - 89:21)
additional XL candy for the same thing (89:18 - 89:24)
Magikarp Dratini Le fenin scrap and (89:21 - 89:27)
nobat in the wild if you're lucky you'll (89:24 - 89:27)
find (89:27 - 89:31)
jangma one star raids will be Dratini (89:27 - 89:33)
Dino three star raids will be duigan (89:31 - 89:35)
turtonator (89:33 - 89:38)
draa which I is kind of funny having (89:35 - 89:40)
like those three dragons in raids I (89:38 - 89:43)
don't know if that was like the the long (89:40 - 89:45)
con but I do think that's like I don't (89:43 - 89:48)
know it's I kind of like they kind of go (89:45 - 89:50)
together yeah well it's like the first (89:48 - 89:52)
time at least for like it's the first (89:50 - 89:53)
time where I feel actually feel like oh (89:52 - 89:57)
I kind of want to do three star raids (89:53 - 90:01)
like it's always it's like really good (89:57 - 90:04)
this week usually three star raids are (90:01 - 90:05)
Pokemon that are evolved so they can't (90:04 - 90:09)
be shiny like they're usually just not (90:05 - 90:11)
they have some purpose I'm sure that I (90:09 - 90:14)
just is not for me but when I saw these (90:11 - 90:16)
three star raids I was kind of surprised (90:14 - 90:18)
like oh I actually might actually I (90:16 - 90:20)
might actually do some frear raids for a (90:18 - 90:21)
while the thing they had going on with (90:20 - 90:23)
frear raids was that they had the (90:21 - 90:25)
Pokemon and three star raids that would (90:23 - 90:26)
have been strong attackers for the five (90:25 - 90:31)
star raids right okay yeah but this time (90:26 - 90:33)
they are Pokemon with exciting shinies (90:31 - 90:36)
yeah I will say going back to the events (90:33 - 90:39)
tab thing why isn't that event in the (90:36 - 90:40)
like upcoming event like there's an (90:39 - 90:43)
upcoming events section and it only has (90:40 - 90:46)
the chansy community day in it why not (90:43 - 90:48)
put the Lunar New Year event and it (90:46 - 90:50)
should be there and I think that's why I (90:48 - 90:53)
was a little unsure about (90:50 - 90:55)
this change because their communication (90:53 - 90:58)
has been kind of iffy for the last since (90:55 - 91:02)
they laid off 200 people and that should (90:58 - 91:04)
be there there is a blog post for this (91:02 - 91:07)
event they should have that event in (91:04 - 91:11)
upom go to news and you can actually (91:07 - 91:14)
click on it and look at the blog post (91:11 - 91:15)
yeah and it's like they have the (91:14 - 91:17)
infographics now that they're making (91:15 - 91:18)
they have all this stuff like you could (91:17 - 91:20)
just put that in there and click be able (91:18 - 91:22)
to click it and have the infographic pop (91:20 - 91:24)
up or something like yep and it could be (91:22 - 91:26)
right there like it's it's there waiting (91:24 - 91:29)
this happening in less than two weeks (91:26 - 91:31)
this is happening in one week yeah (91:29 - 91:34)
February it starts yeah it happens right (91:31 - 91:35)
the day after the chansy community day (91:34 - 91:37)
so they could put it right in there with (91:35 - 91:40)
it uh there will be paid research don't (91:37 - 91:43)
you worry don't your little wallet worry (91:40 - 91:44)
for (91:43 - 91:47)
$2 uh you will get star us XP two lucky (91:44 - 91:50)
eggs encounters with event themed (91:47 - 91:52)
Pokemon um that's all it says that (91:50 - 91:56)
doesn't seem that great I mean $2 is (91:52 - 91:59)
also one of the less expensive tickets (91:56 - 92:02)
yeah yeah yeah there's no clothing it (91:59 - 92:04)
doesn't look lucky egg cost these days (92:02 - 92:07)
lucky lucky egg is 80 cents so you're (92:04 - 92:11)
spending 40 more cents for unsure that's (92:07 - 92:12)
where this is where I don't like the (92:11 - 92:16)
special research like I've always if the (92:12 - 92:18)
special research is always something I'm (92:16 - 92:21)
going to buy but I'm saving money then (92:18 - 92:25)
it always feels like not like a deal but (92:21 - 92:28)
like compelling like like a like a sale (92:25 - 92:30)
I guess of like if it was like three (92:28 - 92:32)
lucky eggs which why is it not three (92:30 - 92:34)
lucky eggs it would be like okay three (92:32 - 92:37)
lucky eggs is more than $2 so I'm going (92:34 - 92:39)
to get three lucky eggs anyways I'm (92:37 - 92:40)
saving money there I'm also getting (92:39 - 92:43)
bonus XP I'm also getting bonus Stardust (92:40 - 92:45)
and then I'm also getting encounters (92:43 - 92:47)
with aine Pokemon so it's probably like (92:45 - 92:49)
what a draa duigan and a terator you (92:47 - 92:52)
would assume with better IVs than you (92:49 - 92:53)
would be able to get in the (92:52 - 92:56)
wild right yeah I mean when you even (92:53 - 92:58)
talk like that like with if it is like (92:56 - 93:01)
draa Dre again or whatever like those (92:58 - 93:03)
are raids you have to do right so now (93:01 - 93:05)
you just you know if you know if you're (93:03 - 93:06)
other than your Daily raid now you're (93:05 - 93:09)
also like that's a dollar like for to go (93:06 - 93:11)
do a draa and a jigan raid like in the (93:09 - 93:14)
day or whatever um so then you're saving (93:11 - 93:16)
there too I guess or it's a deal part of (93:14 - 93:18)
the deal yeah well I guess we'll see (93:16 - 93:21)
what it is when it arrives um speaking (93:18 - 93:23)
of community maybe they should (93:21 - 93:24)
communicate a little bit better where my (93:23 - 93:26)
$2 is going I would like to know (93:24 - 93:28)
beforehand instead of relying on like (93:26 - 93:30)
leak duck to be like oh okay is this (93:28 - 93:32)
actually worth it yeah uh there will (93:30 - 93:35)
also be a global challenge so if we get (93:32 - 93:38)
what is it how many zeros is this is it (93:35 - 93:41)
billion if we get one billion nice (93:38 - 93:44)
throws we will unlock bonuses for all (93:41 - 93:46)
trainers to (93:44 - 93:48)
enjoy um they're saying the first one is (93:46 - 93:50)
a ground second one is a ground third is (93:48 - 93:53)
a fairy fourth is a a dragon and the (93:50 - 93:56)
last one is normal the last one's Granda (93:53 - 93:57)
right (93:56 - 94:00)
like (93:57 - 94:00)
right uh and then there will be (94:01 - 94:04)
different spawns in the wild there will (94:03 - 94:06)
be a question mark question mark (94:04 - 94:08)
question mark one star raid and a (94:06 - 94:10)
question mark question mark shiny three (94:08 - 94:13)
star raid yeah it is interesting to note (94:10 - 94:15)
that of the global challenge wild (94:13 - 94:18)
encounters six of the seven can be shiny (94:15 - 94:20)
yeah look like the seventh one can't be (94:18 - 94:22)
shiny whatever it is proba probably (94:20 - 94:24)
jangma still depending on if they're (94:22 - 94:27)
just going to extend the original (94:24 - 94:30)
encounters yeah yeah well they're saying (94:27 - 94:33)
the one star cannot be shiny either (94:30 - 94:36)
could be Jango maybe Jang onear then (94:33 - 94:38)
which would be cool have one3 read I (94:36 - 94:42)
guess unknown d d for Dragon cannot no (94:38 - 94:45)
that that should be (94:42 - 94:49)
shiny um yeah we completely skipped over (94:45 - 94:52)
the the quality of life improvements (94:49 - 94:54)
oh do you want to go over those I would (94:52 - 94:55)
love to go over the quality of life (94:54 - 94:56)
improvements because these are actually (94:55 - 94:58)
giving me (94:56 - 95:02)
hope so they haven't been I guess they (94:58 - 95:03)
they were (95:02 - 95:07)
officially uh regard like they made a (95:03 - 95:09)
blog post saying some things are (95:07 - 95:11)
changing one of the things is the biomes (95:09 - 95:13)
in the background but another one of the (95:11 - 95:16)
things is that they are both adding (95:13 - 95:19)
buttons to revive all and heal all (95:16 - 95:22)
Pokemon in battles when you're in gyms (95:19 - 95:23)
so that's going to make that a lot (95:22 - 95:26)
faster and they are also adding a ready (95:23 - 95:29)
button for a single player or at least (95:26 - 95:31)
they're testing they are testing the (95:29 - 95:33)
introduction of a ready button for (95:31 - 95:36)
single players in raids after I believe (95:33 - 95:38)
30 seconds avoiding in a Lobby on your (95:36 - 95:40)
own so you don't have to wait out the (95:38 - 95:43)
entire timer when you're just doing a (95:40 - 95:45)
raid by yourself which I think is (95:43 - 95:48)
honestly huge uh and the introduction of (95:45 - 95:50)
actual quality of life improvements like (95:48 - 95:54)
this does make me feel a little bit more (95:50 - 95:56)
hopeful that they're working on that (95:54 - 95:59)
this year instead of just going we need (95:56 - 96:01)
new things new things new things new (95:59 - 96:03)
things they're actually starting to (96:01 - 96:06)
improve some of the things that actually (96:03 - 96:09)
exist yeah that's pretty nice um did you (96:06 - 96:11)
see the other one that just the other (96:09 - 96:12)
quality of life Improvement that like (96:11 - 96:14)
just it's showing up for some trainers (96:12 - 96:17)
now as of like last night uh they show (96:14 - 96:18)
type (96:17 - 96:21)
Effectiveness against grunts really and (96:18 - 96:23)
raids now and so it'll show your moves (96:21 - 96:25)
and whether it's super effective or not (96:23 - 96:28)
very effective um it's only showing up (96:25 - 96:30)
for some trainers but it as of like last (96:28 - 96:32)
night it just (96:30 - 96:36)
started coming out too so yeah nice to (96:32 - 96:39)
nice to see some of that stuff finally (96:36 - 96:42)
come through also this is not new but it (96:39 - 96:45)
is a quality of life just a reminder (96:42 - 96:48)
that you can download the assets again (96:45 - 96:51)
not new at all but if if you go into (96:48 - 96:53)
your your advanced settings in your game (96:51 - 96:56)
this is both on Android and Apple this (96:53 - 96:57)
was something Harry Potter had which was (96:56 - 96:59)
like Harry Potter had it since day one (96:57 - 97:00)
and it was like why isn't this in (96:59 - 97:02)
Pokemon go uh but if you go into your (97:00 - 97:04)
advanced settings you can hit the (97:02 - 97:05)
download all assets just make sure (97:04 - 97:08)
you're on Wi-Fi and you're at home and (97:05 - 97:10)
you can download pretty much all like (97:08 - 97:12)
the images that make up the Pokemon or (97:10 - 97:14)
make up the Pokedex or just make up the (97:12 - 97:18)
game files in total it does take a bit (97:14 - 97:20)
of space on your phone just to heads up (97:18 - 97:22)
there but uh it makes your game Run way (97:20 - 97:25)
way smoother um so this might be very (97:22 - 97:27)
useful to somebody who's like an older (97:25 - 97:28)
phone (97:27 - 97:31)
um click that button before you do have (97:28 - 97:32)
to go in and kind of click it again (97:31 - 97:34)
every once in a while because they keep (97:32 - 97:36)
introducing new things and they don't (97:34 - 97:38)
automatically download yeah it doesn't (97:36 - 97:39)
automatically download but even if you (97:38 - 97:41)
do it once and you forget about it for (97:39 - 97:43)
like six months it's still like you're (97:41 - 97:45)
download still totally worth it you're (97:43 - 97:47)
downloading the bulk of things (97:45 - 97:52)
so um yeah I would I would say that (97:47 - 97:53)
it's kind of cool that there's all these (97:52 - 97:55)
little things that they're doing the (97:53 - 97:58)
biomes the the Team Rocket stuff the (97:55 - 98:02)
Revival the changing the today view all (97:58 - 98:04)
of these have kind of happened in the (98:02 - 98:07)
last like two weeks um and it's shocking (98:04 - 98:09)
because like it's all positive stuff (98:07 - 98:13)
that they've been doing yeah (98:09 - 98:13)
right so um hopefully there's more to (98:14 - 98:20)
come because they haven't really put out (98:17 - 98:23)
like I would expect well maybe not (98:20 - 98:24)
because niantic's very bad at (98:23 - 98:26)
communication I would expect them to put (98:24 - 98:28)
out a big blog post of like here is a (98:26 - 98:30)
bunch of quality of life stuff we've (98:28 - 98:31)
done it's all been finalized it should (98:30 - 98:34)
be rolling out to all trainers um (98:31 - 98:37)
because obviously if you're not in New (98:34 - 98:38)
Zealand right now you don't know what (98:37 - 98:40)
the biome stuff looks like unless you go (98:38 - 98:43)
online and look it up um but hopefully (98:40 - 98:45)
there's a big update and there's even (98:43 - 98:48)
more stuff coming I would (98:45 - 98:52)
hope we have what what's it the uh CNO (98:48 - 98:54)
tour (98:52 - 98:58)
in 3 weeks that already three weeks away (98:54 - 99:04)
I think it's less wow 17th I think it is (98:58 - 99:07)
15th 15th is 17th and 18th 17th and 18th (99:04 - 99:10)
okay the weekend after Valentine's Day (99:07 - 99:12)
yes because I'm flying on Valentine's (99:10 - 99:16)
Day nice ouch it was the this was the (99:12 - 99:17)
cheapest (99:16 - 99:20)
flight I (99:17 - 99:22)
pay (99:20 - 99:24)
um that's pretty much our show for you (99:22 - 99:26)
all today I had that you know there was (99:24 - 99:29)
boosted outbreaks uh for scarlet and (99:26 - 99:30)
violet but by the time this goes up (99:29 - 99:33)
that'll be gone but they did put flutter (99:30 - 99:35)
Man and Iron julus in raids they did (99:33 - 99:37)
rare Mark boosted the cool thing about (99:35 - 99:39)
the boosted outbreaks real quick was (99:37 - 99:42)
just you could get the opposite (99:39 - 99:46)
version scr Gulpin whatever versions (99:42 - 99:47)
they were exclusive to they appeared in (99:46 - 99:50)
both games and vice versa there's two (99:47 - 99:54)
other Pokemon I'm St junky and claer um (99:50 - 99:57)
so they have to pay to win you have to (99:54 - 100:00)
pay because they swapped them for you (99:57 - 100:02)
yeah finally you can get your (100:00 - 100:05)
competitive stunky without needing to (100:02 - 100:07)
trade or pay for the other version of (100:05 - 100:10)
the game pop a Pikachu looking out for (100:07 - 100:13)
those competitive players you don't no (100:10 - 100:16)
more hacked stunky for (100:13 - 100:20)
anyone could have rare Mark or the other (100:16 - 100:23)
one I don't (100:20 - 100:23)
now perfect um hey we did 600 episodes I (100:23 - 100:34)
did a post on patreon how I my life life (100:28 - 100:36)
has been tough for me I did a post on (100:34 - 100:38)
patreon and I there was a lot of (100:36 - 100:40)
deadlines I wanted to hit with 600 that (100:38 - 100:42)
I weren't a wasn't able to hit one of (100:40 - 100:44)
the things I wanted to do for 600 was to (100:42 - 100:47)
go back and listen to the very first (100:44 - 100:50)
episode and provide commentary on it I (100:47 - 100:51)
don't know what that's called called (100:50 - 100:54)
besides providing commentary you know (100:51 - 100:55)
like on a Simpsons DVD where they're (100:54 - 100:57)
like oh let's watch the episode together (100:55 - 100:59)
and I'll give you behind I think it's (100:57 - 101:00)
just called commentary like a director's (100:59 - 101:03)
like a director's commentary or yeah (101:00 - 101:05)
something like that yeah so I so I did (101:03 - 101:08)
that it was only you know a week late (101:05 - 101:10)
which isn't the worst I guess uh so (101:08 - 101:13)
that's up on patreon on the exclusive (101:10 - 101:15)
premium feed also if you're in apple (101:13 - 101:18)
podcast it's there too um Apple podcast (101:15 - 101:19)
is really cool because if you're on (101:18 - 101:21)
iPhone you can just do a two two we free (101:19 - 101:22)
trial you could listen to all the bonus (101:21 - 101:24)
episodes you could cancel it or if you (101:22 - 101:26)
want to keep it uh you get adree (101:24 - 101:27)
episodes every week so you don't have to (101:26 - 101:28)
listen to the ads you get all the bonus (101:27 - 101:30)
episodes when it comes up so there is (101:28 - 101:33)
value to the Apple podcast obviously (101:30 - 101:34)
make apple if if there's any company (101:33 - 101:35)
that makes it very easy to give you (101:34 - 101:37)
money it's it's (101:35 - 101:39)
[Laughter] (101:37 - 101:42)
Apple but supporting like if you if you (101:39 - 101:45)
do subscribe on Apple podcast that that (101:42 - 101:47)
does I I do that does benefit the show (101:45 - 101:52)
obviously patreon does as well so um the (101:47 - 101:55)
there was a real good response to that (101:52 - 101:58)
uh so I guess I'm going to do (101:55 - 102:00)
another commentary episode for February (101:58 - 102:04)
as well uh for patreon people probably (102:00 - 102:06)
won't be episode two (102:04 - 102:10)
because we I we cannot do once a month (102:06 - 102:12)
one episode at a time we'll never get (102:10 - 102:16)
through it so I'll I'll try to find a (102:12 - 102:19)
called job security (102:16 - 102:21)
Ste just me (102:19 - 102:24)
600 (102:21 - 102:26)
months I'll eventually catch up I'll (102:24 - 102:30)
just do it every week where I I have to (102:26 - 102:32)
like I think I think that episode is so (102:30 - 102:34)
enjoyable for probably other people to (102:32 - 102:39)
listen to the first five minutes of that (102:34 - 102:42)
podcast of me listening to myself 14 (102:39 - 102:44)
years ago was the hardest thing I think (102:42 - 102:48)
I've ever done it was the most cringy (102:44 - 102:51)
thing that I felt first off I sound like (102:48 - 102:53)
I'm out of breath in that episode it (102:51 - 102:56)
sounds like I ran on a treadmill and (102:53 - 102:58)
then I decided to whisper into a (102:56 - 103:01)
microphone at 4 (102:58 - 103:01)
a.m. (103:01 - 103:08)
it if that's worth $5 dollar to you (103:03 - 103:11)
patreon.com (103:08 - 103:11)
PKM PKM (103:11 - 103:15)
NC I don't know why I sounded out of (103:16 - 103:22)
breath (103:20 - 103:25)
it was very hard to get through to to be (103:22 - 103:26)
like I don't know if I can do this I (103:25 - 103:28)
don't know if I can listen to myself 26 (103:26 - 103:31)
minutes and post this I I think it (103:28 - 103:33)
turned out okay I think it was very fun (103:31 - 103:38)
um so that's that's on patreon now um (103:33 - 103:40)
I'm gonna assume that there's going to (103:38 - 103:43)
be a sevenstar raid announced tonight (103:40 - 103:46)
since it's been two weeks so uh if (103:43 - 103:48)
you're listening to this on Monday I'll (103:46 - 103:50)
probably be doing raid Builds on Monday (103:48 - 103:51)
if you don't if you can't make it over (103:50 - 103:54)
to Twitch uh it will probably go up on (103:51 - 103:56)
YouTube for you to watch on Tuesday or (103:54 - 103:58)
Wednesday for whatever sevenstar raid it (103:56 - 104:01)
ends up being um I don't know actually (103:58 - 104:02)
at this (104:01 - 104:05)
point I don't maybe they're saving (104:02 - 104:10)
Blastoise and Venusaur for Pokemon day (104:05 - 104:10)
um but maybe maybe Blastoise maybe (104:11 - 104:16)
Venusaur maybe Tor Tera who (104:13 - 104:18)
knows I don't know what they're doing (104:16 - 104:20)
who was it it was just Blazin right it (104:18 - 104:22)
was just blaz (104:20 - 104:25)
yeah if if they do like (104:22 - 104:28)
septile it's going to be dragon type (104:25 - 104:31)
right like that's that's like has to (104:28 - 104:33)
that's the obvious for septile yeah (104:31 - 104:36)
which would be good during Lunar New (104:33 - 104:41)
Year time frame true true two week that (104:36 - 104:43)
would be that would be true I should (104:41 - 104:45)
just start building for Dragon septile (104:43 - 104:49)
right now there's no way that septile (104:45 - 104:53)
isn't anything but dragon (104:49 - 104:53)
sure have they have they done raids in (104:53 - 104:57)
the past I'm just trying to think of (104:56 - 105:02)
like a mega Pokemon whose type changed (104:57 - 105:03)
or like who got a new who like got an (105:02 - 105:06)
added type Charizard and (105:03 - 105:08)
then okay and then Charizard but they (105:06 - 105:11)
did uh dark type (105:08 - 105:13)
Charizard when it came no Charizard was (105:11 - 105:17)
Dragon for the first seven star they I'm (105:13 - 105:20)
thinking of the um the TCG they gave us (105:17 - 105:21)
yes they gave us a fre dark Terra (105:20 - 105:24)
Charizard as a gift to line up with the (105:21 - 105:26)
TCG as a mystery gift that was it right (105:24 - 105:28)
but the first one was Dragon the first (105:26 - 105:32)
Charizard was a dragon Tera yeah yes so (105:28 - 105:33)
then (105:32 - 105:36)
patterns yeah septile will be (105:33 - 105:39)
Dragon no septi has to be (105:36 - 105:41)
dragon has to (105:39 - 105:43)
be wait what's the (105:41 - 105:48)
other sep uh was it Trio Mudkip Torchic (105:43 - 105:51)
yes it be Swamper but but but that's (105:48 - 105:53)
that that's the same that's the same (105:51 - 105:57)
Mega right yeah what was what was blazak (105:53 - 106:00)
Blazin was flying which makes sense (105:57 - 106:02)
because it's a (106:00 - 106:02)
bird kind (106:02 - 106:09)
of okay it's a bird that can't fly it's (106:04 - 106:11)
a blaze (106:09 - 106:16)
again I mean sure (106:11 - 106:16)
yeah uh yeah okay thanks for listening (106:17 - 106:22)
if you're watching on YouTube and you've (106:23 - 106:29)
made it this far what terot type do you (106:26 - 106:31)
think makes the most sense for Swamper (106:29 - 106:36)
we would love to know (106:31 - 106:36)
flying I don't know I I yeah I don't I (106:38 - 106:44)
don't know I think the flying for blazak (106:42 - 106:46)
kid makes sense and I think the Dragon (106:44 - 106:48)
for septile makes sense well the Dragon (106:46 - 106:50)
for septile absolutely makes sense yeah (106:48 - 106:52)
flying for Blazer again sure I'm not (106:50 - 106:54)
arguing with you it does make (106:52 - 106:56)
sense I don't know what would make sense (106:54 - 106:59)
for Swamper you said it's a bird biting (106:56 - 107:02)
you said blaz is a bird but like it's a (106:59 - 107:04)
chicken and chickens notoriously they (107:02 - 107:06)
can they can like Fly for a moment but (107:04 - 107:08)
they can't fly if chickens don't fly (107:06 - 107:10)
they like but it's still a bird it's (107:08 - 107:13)
still a bird so I don't know how look I (107:10 - 107:16)
don't know how drio can fly because you (107:13 - 107:19)
can learn the mo fly but come on let's (107:16 - 107:22)
let's just go with it (107:19 - 107:26)
fine all right uh we will be back next (107:22 - 107:29)
