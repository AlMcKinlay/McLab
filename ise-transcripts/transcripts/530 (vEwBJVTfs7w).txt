i am recording (0:03 - 0:26)
[Music] (0:05 - 0:29)
what's up everyone welcome to the 530th (0:26 - 0:31)
episode of the pokemon podcast it's (0:29 - 0:34)
super effective i am your host steve (0:31 - 0:36)
with me is a will (0:34 - 0:37)
i (0:36 - 0:39)
am so (0:37 - 0:41)
that hangover is not the right word for (0:39 - 0:43)
it but i had way too much mid-autumn (0:41 - 0:46)
festival yesterday and (0:43 - 0:48)
i'm recovering from (0:46 - 0:49)
a little (0:48 - 0:52)
too many moon cakes i bought the wrong (0:49 - 0:55)
sampler platter of mooncakes and (0:52 - 0:57)
i still have to eat them because they're (0:55 - 0:58)
ain't cheap (0:57 - 1:00)
no where did you go (0:58 - 1:03)
uh so the chinese market by my house (1:00 - 1:05)
didn't have moon cakes but there was a (1:03 - 1:08)
vietnamese market in savage that had (1:05 - 1:10)
a good number of them but the problem (1:08 - 1:11)
was (1:10 - 1:13)
the they didn't tell you what kind of (1:11 - 1:16)
moon cakes were inside (1:13 - 1:17)
except they had numbers stamped on them (1:16 - 1:19)
and i have later found out that the (1:17 - 1:21)
numbers indicated what mooncakes were (1:19 - 1:23)
inside (1:21 - 1:23)
and i'd so i was like let me get a (1:24 - 1:28)
sampler like like which you know is four (1:26 - 1:30)
different moon cakes five flight of moon (1:28 - 1:32)
cakes yeah i mean (1:30 - 1:35)
yeah it's a flight (1:32 - 1:36)
um (1:35 - 1:39)
and i mean so far (1:36 - 1:40)
one (1:39 - 1:42)
i had was lotus seed which is good (1:40 - 1:44)
because i like lotus seed (1:42 - 1:46)
but one i had was (1:44 - 1:48)
this is gonna be this is gonna sound so (1:46 - 1:50)
weird to people who don't know what i'm (1:48 - 1:52)
talking about (1:50 - 1:54)
but it's the second one i've tried is (1:52 - 1:57)
mung bean and durian (1:54 - 1:58)
oh (1:57 - 1:59)
i (1:58 - 2:03)
like durian on its own i don't like (1:59 - 2:05)
durian when it's with something else (2:03 - 2:09)
so it's like (2:05 - 2:09)
sure (2:13 - 2:16)
[Laughter] (2:14 - 2:19)
have you never tasted durian (2:16 - 2:21)
no i don't know what that is (2:19 - 2:23)
it's a fruit look who you were talking (2:21 - 2:26)
to have you ever tasted durian do they (2:23 - 2:28)
have it at mcdonald's is it a is it a (2:26 - 2:30)
monthly show yes i said no tell the (2:28 - 2:32)
dollar menu (2:30 - 2:34)
if it's on the dollar menu then yes i've (2:32 - 2:35)
had it (2:34 - 2:37)
it is it's a very (2:35 - 2:40)
unique fruit that has uh (2:37 - 2:43)
it's it's it's very like custardy but (2:40 - 2:44)
you can get durian candy you could derp (2:43 - 2:48)
yeah you can durian anything um (2:44 - 2:48)
but (2:48 - 2:50)
i i think to me it's kind of like (2:48 - 2:52)
cilantro (2:50 - 2:53)
where (2:52 - 2:55)
like some people eat durian and they're (2:53 - 2:58)
like i i really like this (2:55 - 3:00)
um and some people eat it and they're (2:58 - 3:02)
just like hate it i think hmm (3:00 - 3:04)
well the thing is genetic because you (3:02 - 3:07)
genetically make it taste like soap (3:04 - 3:08)
i think (3:07 - 3:11)
if you could imagine (3:08 - 3:12)
making (3:11 - 3:16)
a candy out of onion (3:12 - 3:18)
heck yeah i think that's the best way (3:16 - 3:21)
that i could describe durian but but (3:18 - 3:23)
it's like also like like pudding (3:21 - 3:25)
pudding-ish have you ever seen a person (3:23 - 3:27)
just take eat a sweet vidalia onion like (3:25 - 3:29)
an apple (3:27 - 3:31)
no that is the wildest thing to me and (3:29 - 3:33)
every time it happens i don't know what (3:31 - 3:35)
universe i'm in anymore (3:33 - 3:37)
but yeah that that's i was celebrating (3:35 - 3:40)

in my life (4:18 - 4:22)
it's gotten real weird in there tinder (4:19 - 4:25)
has some competition (4:22 - 4:28)
the the (4:25 - 4:32)
cynthia interaction was so (4:28 - 4:32)
weird and i'm like (4:33 - 4:39)
there's no way to read this (4:36 - 4:41)
i mean there is like you're becoming (4:39 - 4:43)
really good friends but like if you're (4:41 - 4:46)
an adult this is date stuff we're on a (4:43 - 4:48)
date she wants to take me at a special (4:46 - 4:50)
outing to a beach (4:48 - 4:52)
is this like the really good friends of (4:50 - 4:54)
like making somebody a close friend on (4:52 - 4:56)
instagram stories kind of friends no (4:54 - 4:58)
because that means you're showing him (4:56 - 4:59)
naughty pictures (4:58 - 5:01)
that's not true (4:59 - 5:04)
so we've all seen that tick tock yeah (5:01 - 5:06)
that's called got around because (5:04 - 5:10)
that's not how i was using it (5:06 - 5:10)
uh (5:14 - 5:17)
what am i (5:16 - 5:21)
not malicious malicious would like (5:17 - 5:21)
when you upload a friend's story and it (5:21 - 5:26)
turns green that it turns green for them (5:23 - 5:28)
which means like hey i haven't seen greg (5:26 - 5:30)
look at my stories in a while but i bet (5:28 - 5:34)
he'll look at it if it's green (5:30 - 5:34)
no the only people who are agreeing on (5:37 - 5:41)
my instagram are people who are like (5:39 - 5:43)
they don't like to put pictures of (5:41 - 5:45)
themselves but they will do a picture of (5:43 - 5:46)
like a selfie (5:45 - 5:49)
for friends only yeah so the wild thing (5:46 - 5:51)
about instagram right now is the feed is (5:49 - 5:54)
so bad that people will put (5:51 - 5:55)
pictures (5:54 - 5:58)
that are in their feed in their stories (5:55 - 6:01)
so that you know they posted something (5:58 - 6:03)
so most of the time i don't look at (6:01 - 6:05)
stories because i'm like oh this isn't (6:03 - 6:07)
your feed (6:05 - 6:09)
and if it's a green then i have to i (6:07 - 6:11)
have to balance (6:09 - 6:13)
how much in public am i am right now (6:11 - 6:15)
because i don't know what's going to (6:13 - 6:17)
happen when i open that story (6:15 - 6:19)
my career has always been really boring (6:17 - 6:22)
it's always just like well (6:19 - 6:24)
you lack spice (6:22 - 6:26)
not everybody i follow and i'm friends (6:24 - 6:29)
with lacks spice my my instagram (6:26 - 6:31)
experience is like (6:29 - 6:36)
95 90 stories 10 percent posting (6:31 - 6:37)
yeah because that's because they want to (6:36 - 6:40)
make instagram tick tock basically no (6:37 - 6:42)
but stories have existed well before i (6:40 - 6:44)
was using tick tock and i i was always (6:42 - 6:46)
using stories too they changed the they (6:44 - 6:48)
pretty much changed the algorithm so (6:46 - 6:49)
that (6:48 - 6:52)
they are now showing stories and and (6:49 - 6:53)
videos in your feed (6:52 - 6:56)
over pictures (6:53 - 6:57)
so (6:56 - 6:58)
there's a lot of people who are really (6:57 - 7:00)
mad at instagram because instagram is (6:58 - 7:04)
taking a tick tock (7:00 - 7:06)
view yeah yeah but no i i saw all that (7:04 - 7:08)
and then the the ceo of instagram was (7:06 - 7:11)
like no one's looking at the feed people (7:08 - 7:13)
are looking at stories for pictures and (7:11 - 7:15)
i was like yes that is what i am doing (7:13 - 7:17)
because like i think because you made (7:15 - 7:19)
your feet bad no no i don't think it's (7:17 - 7:21)
the i don't think it's the the i think i (7:19 - 7:25)
think it's the genuineness of a story (7:21 - 7:27)
that makes it more compelling versus a (7:25 - 7:29)
curated (7:27 - 7:30)
like photo (7:29 - 7:32)
out of here get get did you (7:30 - 7:35)
silicon valley brainwashed yeah no (7:32 - 7:37)
because i would if if somebody has like (7:35 - 7:39)
six stories (7:37 - 7:41)
right and (7:39 - 7:43)
the stories are just the pictures of the (7:41 - 7:44)
post that they posted to alert you that (7:43 - 7:46)
they put up a post because the algorithm (7:44 - 7:49)
doesn't let you see the post anymore (7:46 - 7:51)
people have to change how they use (7:49 - 7:54)
here's because stories are so bad here's (7:51 - 7:56)
my experience of instagram stories i get (7:54 - 7:58)
an alert on my phone because yes i still (7:56 - 8:00)
get alerts on my phones it's like (7:58 - 8:02)
instagram pkmncast has posted to their (8:00 - 8:04)
story and i click on it and it's (8:02 - 8:06)
featured (8:04 - 8:08)
on the wheel (8:06 - 8:10)
oh hooray i would never post that in my (8:08 - 8:12)
feed but i would post out of my story (8:10 - 8:17)
they are covered feet so why am i there (8:12 - 8:18)
b (8:17 - 8:19)
i don't even know where you're going i (8:18 - 8:21)
don't have any landmarks all i see is it (8:19 - 8:23)
could be any street for all i know that (8:21 - 8:24)
could be that could be a fake street in (8:23 - 8:26)
your basement for all i know that's true (8:24 - 8:28)
i don't want people knowing what street (8:26 - 8:30)
i'm on (8:28 - 8:30)
because they'll figure it out in 24 (8:31 - 8:34)
hours but at that time the story has (8:32 - 8:36)
faded (8:34 - 8:36)
speaking of fading stories we have (8:37 - 8:42)
pokemon news yeah (8:39 - 8:43)
uh we actually just have three things (8:42 - 8:46)
we're gonna focus on today is one of (8:43 - 8:49)
them why the sword shield soundtrack (8:46 - 8:51)
isn't out and we are months away from (8:49 - 8:53)
scarlet violet because it bothered me (8:51 - 8:55)
today uh no (8:53 - 8:58)
although that that is always you know (8:55 - 9:00)
every night i go to sleep i think (8:58 - 9:02)
wait (9:00 - 9:03)
maybe tomorrow when i wake up the (9:02 - 9:06)
soundtrack will be available (9:03 - 9:07)
my twitch chat was like trying to make (9:06 - 9:10)
fun of me for using itunes the other day (9:07 - 9:12)
which is a fair thing to make fun of (9:10 - 9:14)
somebody for because itunes is very (9:12 - 9:17)
boomer software excuse me i checked for (9:14 - 9:18)
what (9:17 - 9:22)
pc well itunes only exists on pc now or (9:18 - 9:23)
windows i should say because on (9:22 - 9:26)
on mac it's it's apple music it's music (9:23 - 9:28)
yes but like what what do you mean (9:26 - 9:29)
you're you like (9:28 - 9:31)
so i use itunes when i stream on twitch (9:29 - 9:33)
because i have all of the pokemon (9:31 - 9:35)
soundtracks (9:33 - 9:36)
i in (9:35 - 9:37)
them through (9:36 - 9:39)
but you you you can't get them anywhere (9:37 - 9:41)
else no (9:39 - 9:42)
so i have to use i i mean i could i (9:41 - 9:44)
could move them into like a vlc player (9:42 - 9:46)
but why would i do that that's just the (9:44 - 9:48)
next plc players are garbage here's the (9:46 - 9:49)
thing (9:48 - 9:52)
people all of you streamers (9:49 - 9:54)
who only stream your music there's going (9:52 - 9:56)
to come a day when they pull your (9:54 - 9:57)
favorite band because they don't want to (9:56 - 9:59)
pay royalties anymore and you will be (9:57 - 10:03)
out out of your favorite band purchase (9:59 - 10:05)
their music to support your artists and (10:03 - 10:07)
you can play it whenever you want that (10:05 - 10:09)
happened to me because wawaka's unhappy (10:07 - 10:12)
refrain used to be on apple music and (10:09 - 10:14)
that's like literally one of my favorite (10:12 - 10:16)
albums of all time and then they're like (10:14 - 10:17)
oh it's not licensed for the united (10:16 - 10:19)
states anymore (10:17 - 10:21)
right but if you bought it you own it (10:19 - 10:22)
well (10:21 - 10:25)
so buy your stuff (10:22 - 10:27)
i mean i'm sure i'm sure there's like a (10:25 - 10:28)
youtube playlist out there that has all (10:27 - 10:31)
the songs and uh well youtube will yank (10:28 - 10:31)
it when (10:31 - 10:33)
it stops being profitable you cannot (10:31 - 10:35)
trust a corporation to keep your (10:33 - 10:37)
favorite things available to you for all (10:35 - 10:39)
time i'm just saying that if you want (10:37 - 10:42)
the pokemon music you can still purchase (10:39 - 10:43)
it (10:42 - 10:46)
through i should slash apple music and (10:43 - 10:48)
it's like ten dollars an album or (10:46 - 10:49)
whatever they have every they have let's (10:48 - 10:52)
go pikachu let's go evie (10:49 - 10:52)
yeah they don't have they don't have (10:53 - 10:56)
sword shield they don't have legends and (10:55 - 10:59)
they don't have bdsp but to be fair (10:56 - 11:00)
legends and bdsp aren't even a year old (10:59 - 11:03)
yet so i give them a pass did they (11:00 - 11:05)
change the music for bdsp yeah because (11:03 - 11:08)
you can remember uh there's uh i made it (11:05 - 11:09)
right (11:08 - 11:11)
there's like a guy you can talk to that (11:09 - 11:13)
will switch it to the old music i'm (11:11 - 11:15)
going to admit that i've actively (11:13 - 11:17)
deleted so much of my memories about (11:15 - 11:19)
bdsp (11:17 - 11:19)
you know it's not it's not great (11:20 - 11:25)
you know what is great they continue to (11:22 - 11:26)
uh (11:25 - 11:30)

ago this is my third year in uh (11:55 - 12:00)
third anniversary of being in minnesota (11:58 - 12:03)
i'm having a crisis (12:00 - 12:05)
uh i made a graphic for that which is uh (12:03 - 12:07)
on instagram yeah but it's over by the (12:05 - 12:09)
time that this no it goes (12:07 - 12:11)
they've made them longer they made them (12:09 - 12:13)
longer thankfully because i did it on so (12:11 - 12:16)
i did it on friday i found a shiny snob (12:13 - 12:18)
i didn't catch it i'm like okay well i'm (12:16 - 12:19)
gonna do this this weekend and then (12:18 - 12:21)
promptly forgot (12:19 - 12:23)
so i'm glad that it's extended so that i (12:21 - 12:25)
can try again (12:23 - 12:29)
um yeah it goes until september 19th (12:25 - 12:31)
which (12:29 - 12:31)
you know (12:31 - 12:34)
the raids are returning for scarlet (12:32 - 12:36)
violet (12:34 - 12:37)
there's no way they're not going to do (12:36 - 12:40)
something like this in scarlet violet (12:37 - 12:42)
it seems wildly successful from a from a (12:40 - 12:47)
customer's perspective i'm i'm sure (12:42 - 12:49)
that's what if (12:47 - 12:51)
most games sell microtransactions and (12:49 - 12:54)
skins and other stuff so they want you (12:51 - 12:56)
to come back to their game to sell (12:54 - 12:56)
um (12:56 - 12:58)
[Music] (12:56 - 13:01)
but i i'm sure there's some end game (12:58 - 13:03)
that they're getting whether that's data (13:01 - 13:05)
or playtime or whatever they're getting (13:03 - 13:07)
from you that isn't a skin (13:05 - 13:09)
but they keep doing them and they keep (13:07 - 13:11)
doing them every month and they figured (13:09 - 13:13)
out that three days is is not long (13:11 - 13:15)
enough and they've been doing about (13:13 - 13:19)
10 days yeah uh and that's that's great (13:15 - 13:21)
um so if you're listening to this (13:19 - 13:24)
shiny snom in the wild area in max raid (13:21 - 13:26)
only in five star uh again it's on (13:24 - 13:27)
twitter it's on instagram if you want (13:26 - 13:29)
the graphics you know they'll probably (13:27 - 13:30)
do another one next month i'll make a (13:29 - 13:32)
graphic for that (13:30 - 13:33)
um (13:32 - 13:35)
but yeah also they usually do the (13:33 - 13:38)
evolution um obviously there's a theme (13:35 - 13:41)
here with the three little squishy dudes (13:38 - 13:42)
i know i i don't know (13:41 - 13:44)
what what do you call snom pukamuka and (13:42 - 13:46)
pinkerton out of squishy dudes i don't (13:44 - 13:49)
know what (13:46 - 13:51)
they're i mean they are the closest (13:49 - 13:52)
thing to (13:51 - 13:57)
pokemon squish mellows hacky sacks (13:52 - 13:57)
uh you know you put frostmouth there you (13:58 - 14:03)
kind of destroy the the hacky sack theme (14:00 - 14:05)
um but usually it's the the evolution (14:03 - 14:08)
uh but that's happening um (14:05 - 14:10)

through distribution (15:47 - 15:50)

through (15:50 - 15:54)
visiting certain stores (15:51 - 15:56)
they're code cards (15:54 - 15:58)
so they're unique you scratch it off (15:56 - 16:01)
like a lottery ticket like most gamestop (15:58 - 16:02)
events for those americans being like (16:01 - 16:05)
why i have what what is this (16:02 - 16:06)
uh (16:05 - 16:09)
you you can go to game (16:06 - 16:12)
uh micro mania and what is the last one (16:09 - 16:13)
they don't have the last one here on the (16:12 - 16:16)
list what is the last one micromania (16:13 - 16:20)
game another one okay uk is game france (16:16 - 16:22)
micro mania in netherlands and belgium (16:20 - 16:24)
to check out gamer mania (16:22 - 16:28)
gamer mania there you go gamer mania (16:24 - 16:29)
um (16:28 - 16:32)
so they did this this this is not unique (16:29 - 16:35)
to the uk this was originally a japanese (16:32 - 16:37)
event and i actually made a youtube (16:35 - 16:41)
video about that of how you could order (16:37 - 16:44)
a specific set of the japanese trading (16:41 - 16:45)
card game and then it would come with (16:44 - 16:47)
these (16:45 - 16:49)
codes the points (16:47 - 16:50)
and then you would add the points (16:49 - 16:52)
together and you could redeem these (16:50 - 16:53)
three pokemon but you could also redeem (16:52 - 16:55)
a master ball you could read an app or (16:53 - 16:57)
cornballs (16:55 - 16:59)
um you could redeem a bunch of stuff you (16:57 - 17:01)
also if you didn't live if you if you (16:59 - 17:03)
lived in japan you didn't have to buy (17:01 - 17:04)
pokemon cards you could buy like a (17:03 - 17:06)
coffee at a 7-eleven and you could get a (17:04 - 17:07)
point (17:06 - 17:09)
and ideally you just needed 30 points to (17:07 - 17:10)
get (17:09 - 17:12)
everything in the list (17:10 - 17:14)
and i made a video on how you like what (17:12 - 17:16)
cards to order to import because you (17:14 - 17:17)
would also get the cards but you would (17:16 - 17:19)
get the points so you get both or you (17:17 - 17:20)
could just find somebody who's just (17:19 - 17:22)
selling you points (17:20 - 17:25)
and then they moved that over to korea (17:22 - 17:27)
and in south korea there was the same (17:25 - 17:31)
event except uh the south korean website (17:27 - 17:34)
put up uh like (17:31 - 17:36)
you needed you ultimately needed a vpn (17:34 - 17:37)
because if you tried to log in to do the (17:36 - 17:40)
point system there um it blocked you (17:37 - 17:42)
and it was way more work than the (17:40 - 17:44)
japanese event was (17:42 - 17:47)
um and now it's in the uk sarah b (17:44 - 17:49)
joe mr joe saraby tweeted that he (17:47 - 17:51)
doesn't think this is coming to the u.s (17:49 - 17:53)
it hasn't come to the u.s (17:51 - 17:56)
i don't know why he thinks that um i (17:53 - 17:57)
don't know what information he has (17:56 - 18:01)
versus others i i to be frank i'm very (17:57 - 18:02)
surprised i came to the uk it seemed (18:01 - 18:04)
very much like a (18:02 - 18:07)
japanese slash south korean event south (18:04 - 18:09)
korea always gets a lot of like (18:07 - 18:11)
events that no one else gets (18:09 - 18:13)
but they also like (18:11 - 18:15)
they just got like the latios movie for (18:13 - 18:17)
the first time like two years ago or (18:15 - 18:19)
something (18:17 - 18:19)
um (18:20 - 18:22)
so if you're an american person you're (18:21 - 18:25)
listening to this you want mar shadow (18:22 - 18:27)
genesect volcanion (18:25 - 18:29)
i'm sure a lot of people do specifically (18:27 - 18:31)
marshado i think is pretty soft out of (18:29 - 18:33)
her genocide you play pokemon go spend (18:31 - 18:35)
the dollar give niantic the dollar you (18:33 - 18:37)
get your genocide (18:35 - 18:39)
um (18:37 - 18:41)
your options are (18:39 - 18:43)
find somebody in the uk and ask them to (18:41 - 18:46)
walk into a micro mania or a game and (18:43 - 18:47)
pick you up code cards and then have (18:46 - 18:49)
them scratch off the code cards and then (18:47 - 18:51)
have them take a picture of it and send (18:49 - 18:52)
it to you uh that would be your free (18:51 - 18:54)
option that requires you to know (18:52 - 18:58)
somebody in europe um (18:54 - 19:00)
your second option is uh if you don't (18:58 - 19:02)
have friends to do that somebody i'm (19:00 - 19:05)
sure on ebay will gladly walk into a (19:02 - 19:06)
store for you and get you these cards (19:05 - 19:08)
and they will sell you these cards on (19:06 - 19:10)
ebay for whatever (19:08 - 19:11)
they cost i'm not sure what they're (19:10 - 19:13)
going for i would if i was to guess (19:11 - 19:14)
probably (19:13 - 19:17)
15 bucks (19:14 - 19:20)
i feel like i did the japanese thing (19:17 - 19:24)
for this i feel like you did too (19:20 - 19:24)
because i remember there were some (19:24 - 19:29)
people in the slack that imported cards (19:26 - 19:31)
based on my video and if you imported (19:29 - 19:35)
one box of cards you got like 54 points (19:31 - 19:38)
but you only could use 30 the extra (19:35 - 19:40)
points were not (19:38 - 19:41)
you couldn't do anything with them so (19:40 - 19:42)
people were giving the extra points to (19:41 - 19:45)
other people so they could (19:42 - 19:46)
get them (19:45 - 19:48)
and then what did you do with the cards (19:46 - 19:50)
i opened them and then i put them in a (19:48 - 19:52)
binder and then all the fillers sit in a (19:50 - 19:55)
box in my closet (19:52 - 19:55)
like pokemon cards should do (19:55 - 19:59)
do you know (20:00 - 20:03)
japanese pokemon cards are actually kind (20:01 - 20:05)
of the worst (20:03 - 20:08)
because you can order them (20:05 - 20:09)
and then import them and they're fun (20:08 - 20:11)
like obviously (20:09 - 20:13)
like they're fun to collect and (20:11 - 20:16)
people like the silver board or over the (20:13 - 20:17)
gold border of the american cards and (20:16 - 20:19)
the backs are better card quality is (20:17 - 20:23)
better the problem is (20:19 - 20:25)
no one will take them (20:23 - 20:27)
like if i order (20:25 - 20:31)
17 booster boxes which is 36 x 17 or (20:27 - 20:34)
whatever and i rip open all these packs (20:31 - 20:36)
and i get my charizard v rainbow rare (20:34 - 20:38)
and i get my grim snarl v rainbow (20:36 - 20:42)
whatever i get my marnie (20:38 - 20:44)
i put them in my binder or i sell them (20:42 - 20:45)
or whatever i do with them and then you (20:44 - 20:47)
have you know thousands of thousands of (20:45 - 20:49)
bulk cards (20:47 - 20:51)
you can drive down to your local shop (20:49 - 20:53)
and be like i don't want this book and (20:51 - 20:55)
they'll be like i'll gladly give you (20:53 - 20:57)
twenty dollars for ten thousand useless (20:55 - 20:59)
cards and you'll be like yes that's (20:57 - 21:01)
perfect because i would rather (20:59 - 21:03)
have twenty dollars than to throw these (21:01 - 21:04)
away (21:03 - 21:06)
no one will take japanese cards they (21:04 - 21:08)
don't want them they can't (21:06 - 21:10)
do anything with them they ca they can't (21:08 - 21:12)
make any money off them (21:10 - 21:15)
it's like really weird because (21:12 - 21:16)
you would think it's just another thing (21:15 - 21:18)
they would put in their display case at (21:16 - 21:20)
their store and be able to sell but (21:18 - 21:22)
nobody wants them no exactly that's what (21:20 - 21:24)
i'm saying what you need to do is you (21:22 - 21:27)
need to start a correspondence program (21:24 - 21:28)
for (21:27 - 21:31)
lonely card needers in japan (21:28 - 21:33)
and say i will send you a (21:31 - 21:35)
card a month (21:33 - 21:38)
and a special note (21:35 - 21:40)
for the same price as a cup of coffee (21:38 - 21:43)
you can get a pokemon japanese card sent (21:40 - 21:46)
to your home that's what do like a (21:43 - 21:48)
monthly letter to (21:46 - 21:50)
some subscription level and just include (21:48 - 21:54)
a japanese pokemon card in every letter (21:50 - 21:57)
you're a patreon you i do this (21:54 - 21:59)
you (21:57 - 21:59)
because you refuse to fill out your (21:59 - 22:04)
address in patreon so when i export this (22:01 - 22:05)
man (22:04 - 22:08)
drives past my house at least 15 times a (22:05 - 22:09)
week (22:08 - 22:10)
at this point you can just check it out (22:09 - 22:13)
the window onto the lawn (22:10 - 22:14)
just take a break tie it to the brick (22:13 - 22:16)
and throw it through the window right (22:14 - 22:19)
the real issue is like i think mtg is (22:16 - 22:22)
the only trading card game where you can (22:19 - 22:24)
play cards they don't care what language (22:22 - 22:25)
it is (22:24 - 22:27)
and because you can't play japanese (22:25 - 22:30)
cards in the us (22:27 - 22:33)
you can't play the the us rule is it has (22:30 - 22:35)
to be english (22:33 - 22:36)
yes (22:35 - 22:39)
but if you played if you played right (22:36 - 22:40)
right in europe you can play any of the (22:39 - 22:43)
european languages correct (22:40 - 22:46)
except yeah in japan you have to only (22:43 - 22:48)
play were you about to say that japanese (22:46 - 22:50)
is a european language no no i was yeah (22:48 - 22:54)
those words were about yeah (22:50 - 22:56)
we saw them forming in the brain we (22:54 - 22:59)
could hear the cogs going (22:56 - 23:02)
because because uh (22:59 - 23:06)
the only is so out of like italian um (23:02 - 23:07)
french (23:06 - 23:09)
uh there's no spanish english (23:07 - 23:10)
um (23:09 - 23:13)
spanish is a language spanish is a (23:10 - 23:15)
language but there is no spanish pokemon (23:13 - 23:16)
cards are you sure (23:15 - 23:19)
yes what yes i'm pretty sure there's (23:16 - 23:21)
portuguese ones there are portuguese (23:19 - 23:23)
cards yes why aren't they portuguese (23:21 - 23:26)
ones and not spanish ones so so spanish (23:23 - 23:29)
to to to the like 10 spanish (23:26 - 23:30)
people who listen to the show because i (23:29 - 23:32)
know you're out there i know who you are (23:30 - 23:35)
two of you two of you are patrons um (23:32 - 23:37)
spanish got completely (23:35 - 23:40)
skipped over in the language thing so (23:37 - 23:43)
every pokemon like every (23:40 - 23:45)
pokemon their spanish name is just their (23:43 - 23:47)
english name (23:45 - 23:50)
so like german like snorlax is relaxo (23:47 - 23:51)
right (23:50 - 23:54)
mr mime in japanese is barrier uh (23:51 - 23:57)
flareon in japanese is booster uh (23:54 - 24:00)
coughing in german is smogon there that (23:57 - 24:02)
now you know why smoke on his name smoke (24:00 - 24:03)
on um (24:02 - 24:06)
for spanish charizard is just charizard (24:03 - 24:08)
vaporeon is just reporion mimikyu is (24:06 - 24:11)
just mimikyu there there is no spanish (24:08 - 24:13)
names for pokemon (24:11 - 24:15)
so (24:13 - 24:18)
they they just also get english cards (24:15 - 24:22)
that's just ridiculous why (24:18 - 24:22)
i feel like there's a point where they (24:22 - 24:26)
could have but but they they missed it (24:24 - 24:28)
with the naming thing right like but (24:26 - 24:29)
they did they did they did all the (24:28 - 24:32)
languages in chinese (24:29 - 24:33)
year's eve yeah they haven't had in (24:32 - 24:36)
spanish they could have dipped into the (24:33 - 24:38)
spanish market and made more money by (24:36 - 24:41)
selling spanish online what's going on (24:38 - 24:43)
but i feel like now speaking is a right (24:41 - 24:45)
market for a bunch of pokemon knockouts (24:43 - 24:48)
but it's not just spain it's like (24:45 - 24:49)
most of (24:48 - 24:52)
central and south america as well (24:49 - 24:53)
i mean we could go back to the (24:52 - 24:55)
conversation of saying japanese cards (24:53 - 24:58)
don't resell at all only english cards (24:55 - 25:01)
do so maybe that's part of i don't know (24:58 - 25:02)
they probably don't do it because if (25:01 - 25:05)
they did then they'd have to let the us (25:02 - 25:07)
players use spanish language cards (25:05 - 25:11)
because it's the americas oh yeah (25:07 - 25:11)
yeah (25:11 - 25:14)
there's also no canadian cards they're (25:12 - 25:17)
all in english as well (25:14 - 25:17)
look (25:18 - 25:20)
[Laughter] (25:19 - 25:21)
french (25:20 - 25:23)
canadian french isn't true french and (25:21 - 25:25)
nobody should recognize it (25:23 - 25:27)
uh so yeah um (25:25 - 25:30)
volcanion uh did does this have an end (25:27 - 25:32)
date (25:30 - 25:33)
i don't see an end date here oh yes this (25:32 - 25:35)
event will run from september 9th to (25:33 - 25:37)
september 30th it does not say when the (25:35 - 25:40)
codes expire though it's just that (25:37 - 25:42)
micro mania will stop (25:40 - 25:45)
getting them sent to their stores to (25:42 - 25:47)
hand out so (25:45 - 25:50)
uh if you if you want to do that (25:47 - 25:51)

is is a spoiler ash has a surface (27:17 - 27:22)
okay i started watching the anime series (27:22 - 27:27)
again and can i tell you one thing (27:24 - 27:30)
every time it opens and says a netflix (27:27 - 27:32)
series i get annoyed (27:30 - 27:34)
netflix you didn't make this you didn't (27:32 - 27:35)
make this this isn't yours those (27:34 - 27:38)
royalties (27:35 - 27:39)
just say (27:38 - 27:41)
netflix is is (27:39 - 27:42)
profiting off (27:41 - 27:46)
somebody else's work (27:42 - 27:46)
that's the whole business model of (27:46 - 27:50)
netflix i know (27:48 - 27:52)
i was gonna say (27:50 - 27:53)
most things don't say a netflix series (27:52 - 27:56)
that has existed for that long it just (27:53 - 27:57)
annoys me i see what you're saying (27:56 - 28:00)
because there's been so much history (27:57 - 28:02)
i mean (28:00 - 28:04)
it's just like a four kids (28:02 - 28:07)
a whatever else came after a netcast (28:04 - 28:10)
network list all the ones that ever (28:07 - 28:13)
owned it at that point (28:10 - 28:15)
netflix series my book oh oh i have i (28:13 - 28:18)
have a list here uh for for sorry going (28:15 - 28:20)
back to marshadow volcano and genesect (28:18 - 28:24)
if you're in the uk game spain game (28:20 - 28:27)
italy ireland germany gamestop (28:24 - 28:28)
not to be confused with the american (28:27 - 28:31)
gamestop france micro mania netherlands (28:28 - 28:34)
and belgium game mania (28:31 - 28:35)
that was it sorry i thought there was (28:34 - 28:38)
gonna be more countries there (28:35 - 28:38)
i have a feeling like the people in (28:38 - 28:43)
those countries have a much better clue (28:40 - 28:46)
of where to go than we do (28:43 - 28:49)
yeah probably um (28:46 - 28:52)
so uh until september 22nd you can get (28:49 - 28:54)
ash's surfetch (28:52 - 28:56)
uh and then (28:54 - 28:58)
there should be a couple more days left (28:56 - 29:00)
for ash's gengar if you're listening to (28:58 - 29:03)
this dragon night just expired most of (29:00 - 29:05)
the ash most of ash's pokemon have been (29:03 - 29:07)
going for about two weeks (29:05 - 29:08)
um (29:07 - 29:10)
they're not anything special in the sake (29:08 - 29:13)
of like no cherish ball (29:10 - 29:15)
um (29:13 - 29:17)
but i i think i think there are (29:15 - 29:19)
there are two types of pokemon code (29:17 - 29:21)
redeemers no there are three types sorry (29:19 - 29:23)
number number one is bobby yeah who gets (29:21 - 29:25)
very excited about all of these (29:23 - 29:26)
distributions and then proceeds to (29:25 - 29:28)
forget them yes uh and then (29:26 - 29:30)
complains in slack that they forgot yes (29:28 - 29:33)
number number two is is a person like me (29:30 - 29:35)
where i want every single event (29:33 - 29:38)
distribution available because most (29:35 - 29:39)
because all of these have some sort of (29:38 - 29:41)
ribbon on them (29:39 - 29:43)
and even though they're not shiny (29:41 - 29:46)
uh how many you know charizards with a (29:43 - 29:47)
classic ribbon do you have (29:46 - 29:49)
you probably have like 30 shiny (29:47 - 29:50)
charizards because you played let's go (29:49 - 29:52)
pikachu let's go eevee but you probably (29:50 - 29:53)
don't have (29:52 - 29:57)
three charizards with ribbons but (29:53 - 29:58)
that leads us into number three the (29:57 - 30:01)
person that will ask the question (29:58 - 30:03)
what makes this so special (30:01 - 30:05)
because (30:03 - 30:06)
they don't care about ribbons they don't (30:05 - 30:09)
care about cherish balls they don't care (30:06 - 30:11)
they don't (30:09 - 30:12)
i feel like what they're really asking (30:11 - 30:15)
is like does it have an exclusive move (30:12 - 30:17)
and or is it shiny is what they're (30:15 - 30:19)
asking because they don't care about the (30:17 - 30:21)
other things that really make (30:19 - 30:24)
event pokemon special which is (30:21 - 30:26)
like the ribbon is what makes it special (30:24 - 30:27)
uh whether you care about the ribbon or (30:26 - 30:29)
not the cherished ball too but (30:27 - 30:32)
ash didn't catch these in cherish balls (30:29 - 30:35)
hence why they're not in cherish (30:32 - 30:35)
balls okay can you even buy cherished (30:35 - 30:42)
balls in any of the games no no no no (30:38 - 30:44)
that's why (30:42 - 30:44)
it it (30:44 - 30:48)
i (30:46 - 30:48)
though (30:48 - 30:51)
there's like a slight frustration that (30:49 - 30:53)
that the most characters in the anime (30:51 - 30:55)
only use pokeballs (30:53 - 30:57)
because it would it there's a kind of (30:55 - 31:00)
coolness i guess if like ash caught this (30:57 - 31:01)
in a ultra ball so then it would come in (31:00 - 31:03)
an ultra ball and you'd be like oh like (31:01 - 31:05)
there's like there's a reason like (31:03 - 31:06)
there's (31:05 - 31:07)
the reason he caught an ultra ball is (31:06 - 31:09)
because he like won an ultra ball in the (31:07 - 31:11)
fishing contest two episodes again and (31:09 - 31:12)
then he just (31:11 - 31:15)
there's he just uses a pokemon (31:12 - 31:18)
pokemon at all times he look ash is the (31:15 - 31:20)
most basic among us (31:18 - 31:23)
he's not basic he's frugal (31:20 - 31:25)
he's not spending money on pokeballs (31:23 - 31:27)
that he doesn't need that kid has (31:25 - 31:30)
traveled the world 80 million times he (31:27 - 31:31)
can clearly (31:30 - 31:34)
just hop on a plane for for without it (31:31 - 31:36)
denting his wallet he's researching his (31:34 - 31:39)
book how to travel the world on a dollar (31:36 - 31:41)
a day (31:39 - 31:41)
do you how many people has he defeated (31:42 - 31:45)
at this point (31:44 - 31:48)
he's got to be swimming in money (31:45 - 31:51)
is ash a digital nomad is he just oh (31:48 - 31:53)
yeah yeah his mom takes all his money (31:51 - 31:54)
yeah (31:53 - 31:56)
that's and then buy stuff that he (31:54 - 31:57)
doesn't ask for (31:56 - 31:59)
mime invested (31:57 - 32:00)
and then eventually after playing you (31:59 - 32:02)
know hard cold soul silver for like four (32:00 - 32:04)
months your mom will eventually buy a (32:02 - 32:07)
sunstone and then you can eventually (32:04 - 32:10)
evolve your sun current into a sunfloor (32:07 - 32:11)
for the pokedex entry that you've been (32:10 - 32:13)
missing and then some people are gonna (32:11 - 32:14)
be like we'll do the bug catching (32:13 - 32:16)
contest well no i don't play i don't (32:14 - 32:17)
stream on twitch on sundays where that's (32:16 - 32:20)
the only chance to win the sunstone is (32:17 - 32:21)
like the five percent of the bug (32:20 - 32:22)
catching contest i just gotta wait for (32:21 - 32:24)
my mom to buy it at this point because (32:22 - 32:25)
and (32:24 - 32:27)
anyways (32:25 - 32:28)
uh (32:27 - 32:30)
everything has to be twitch content (32:28 - 32:32)
sometimes you can get sun stones for (32:30 - 32:35)
your own enjoyment look (32:32 - 32:36)
there's no enjoyment of playing a heart (32:35 - 32:38)
cold soul so for us this is true (32:36 - 32:41)
but (32:38 - 32:41)
there's no enchantment there (32:42 - 32:49)
um okay we got rid of all the news that (32:45 - 32:50)
isn't scarlet and violet (32:49 - 32:52)
no he did not (32:50 - 32:53)
what (32:52 - 32:56)
clefairy is coming to unite (32:53 - 32:58)
oh yeah i was (32:56 - 33:00)
i mean that's such (32:58 - 33:01)
i mean it's so (33:00 - 33:03)
much far away (33:01 - 33:04)
just mention it now we don't know (33:03 - 33:06)
anything about it kaveri is coming (33:04 - 33:10)
it can it can be conflable (33:06 - 33:12)
cool (33:10 - 33:13)
uh hot take i would rather it stay (33:12 - 33:16)
clefairy like pikachu stays pikachu well (33:13 - 33:19)
they are saying it is an optional (33:16 - 33:20)
evolution like scyther is going to be an (33:19 - 33:22)
optional evolution that you can go to (33:20 - 33:26)
scissor or keep it as a scyther (33:22 - 33:26)
i i don't i don't understand i don't (33:28 - 33:31)
know what they're doing in the game (33:30 - 33:32)
anymore i don't even know if i like that (33:31 - 33:35)
game anymore so (33:32 - 33:35)
first you said i was right about the (33:36 - 33:38)
trainer lodge now you're gonna be like (33:37 - 33:40)
you know steve was right i'm taking a (33:38 - 33:42)
break from you tonight i can always be (33:40 - 33:44)
wild right now i can oh i can be clear i (33:42 - 33:46)
don't like that game anymore i can only (33:44 - 33:48)
agree with you so much before i feel (33:46 - 33:51)
like i've been poisoned so (33:48 - 33:52)
let's just keep it where it's at right (33:51 - 33:54)
now all right the triple threat greg is (33:52 - 33:56)
gonna be like you know what i really (33:54 - 33:59)
love pokemon go (33:56 - 33:59)
head trauma will make that happen maybe (34:02 - 34:07)
severe head drama (34:05 - 34:09)
hey i think pokemon goes in a good place (34:07 - 34:10)
right now (34:09 - 34:13)
i've been having a good time with it (34:10 - 34:13)
i mean i could be like i could get worse (34:16 - 34:20)
but yeah yeah pokemon go could actually (34:18 - 34:23)
get one yeah it could (34:20 - 34:25)
actually there is news there is news (34:23 - 34:26)
sorry i i was i thought we were gonna go (34:25 - 34:28)
a whole episode without talking about (34:26 - 34:31)
pokemon go we could we could but (34:28 - 34:33)
this is the actually good news for (34:31 - 34:34)
pokemon go (34:33 - 34:37)
that niatik didn't announce at all (34:34 - 34:40)
if you go into the advanced settings in (34:37 - 34:42)
pokemon go now you can do (34:40 - 34:45)
the harry potter wizards unite day one (34:42 - 34:50)
thing which is download all the assets (34:45 - 34:54)
it's like 800 megabytes it's huge so (34:50 - 34:56)
don't do it when you're on your like 5g (34:54 - 34:57)
connection (34:56 - 35:01)
but it will make your game run so much (34:57 - 35:03)
smoother so like if you do play pokemon (35:01 - 35:05)
go a lot and you have the room on your (35:03 - 35:07)
phone maybe like look if you just play (35:05 - 35:09)
community and pokemon go i would still (35:07 - 35:11)
do this (35:09 - 35:13)
uh you you go into your settings scroll (35:11 - 35:15)
all the way down the bottom it should (35:13 - 35:16)
say advanced settings one of the (35:15 - 35:18)
advanced settings is like the high (35:16 - 35:20)
refresh rate i suggest turning that on (35:18 - 35:22)
but it will destroy your battery (35:20 - 35:23)
um (35:22 - 35:25)
so if you're very conservative about (35:23 - 35:27)
your battery maybe don't turn that on uh (35:25 - 35:28)
if you always have a battery pack or you (35:27 - 35:30)
always have a car charger or whatever (35:28 - 35:32)
then like turn it on um and then the (35:30 - 35:34)
second one is like download all assets (35:32 - 35:36)
uh do that (35:34 - 35:40)
318.9 megabytes that's part one (35:36 - 35:43)
then it will jump to like 800. oh (35:40 - 35:44)
dang (35:43 - 35:46)
yeah and okay so (35:44 - 35:47)
also (35:46 - 35:48)
on my (35:47 - 35:50)
multi-gigabyte phone (35:48 - 35:52)
i'm gonna give you guys some tech (35:50 - 35:53)
support here (35:52 - 35:55)
if it gets stuck (35:53 - 35:57)
and it doesn't go anywhere (35:55 - 35:59)
because i i tried everything i tried to (35:57 - 36:01)
like force quit the app i tried to (35:59 - 36:02)
refresh the app because under advanced (36:01 - 36:05)
settings you can like refresh it too (36:02 - 36:07)
none of that works if it gets stuck you (36:05 - 36:09)
have to delete the app (36:07 - 36:11)
re-download the app from the app store (36:09 - 36:12)
log back in you're not going to lose (36:11 - 36:14)
your data and then it will fix it too (36:12 - 36:15)
much (36:14 - 36:17)
i know that's a lot it's not too much (36:15 - 36:18)
it's too much (36:17 - 36:20)
only if it gets stuck only if it gets (36:18 - 36:22)
stuck yeah and what you're saying is it (36:20 - 36:25)
gets stuck wow it only it gets stuck so (36:22 - 36:27)
many because it has a culture how many (36:25 - 36:30)
soundtracks and itunes i have to delete (36:27 - 36:34)
to fit that assets on my phone (36:30 - 36:34)
just just just delete the platinum (36:34 - 36:38)
soundtrack you'll be fine (36:36 - 36:42)
what this that's the best soundtrack (36:38 - 36:44)
delete the sun and moon soundtrack it's (36:42 - 36:46)
barely any different than the ultra sun (36:44 - 36:48)
and moon soundtrack (36:46 - 36:49)
okay (36:48 - 36:51)
we're gonna take a break uh when we come (36:49 - 36:53)
back we got a bunch of scarlet and (36:51 - 36:54)
violet stuff then question of the week (36:53 - 36:55)
pokemon of the week and then that will (36:54 - 37:00)
be our show so we will be right back (36:55 - 37:04)
and we are back from our break (37:00 - 37:06)
the big stuff (37:04 - 37:09)
the scarlet and violet stuff the reason (37:06 - 37:11)
that look if you made it through (37:09 - 37:14)
the first 30 minutes of the show (37:11 - 37:15)
you must be really excited to survive (37:14 - 37:18)
the next 50. (37:15 - 37:18)
i mean we have time stamps too i don't (37:18 - 37:21)
know how many people actually use the (37:20 - 37:22)
time stamps but (37:21 - 37:24)
okay (37:22 - 37:26)
this was on september 7th it was like (37:24 - 37:29)
what like a three minute trailer (37:26 - 37:31)
uh (37:29 - 37:32)
before i read everything i want to say (37:31 - 37:34)
that this trailer was (37:32 - 37:36)
bad but not bad in the information (37:34 - 37:40)
provided it was just like a very (37:36 - 37:43)
distracting slash (37:40 - 37:45)
whatever music choice they used was not (37:43 - 37:48)
good (37:45 - 37:48)
i didn't notice the music at all no i (37:48 - 37:51)
don't think what the heck you're talking (37:50 - 37:54)
about it just it just felt very like (37:51 - 37:56)
chaotic but not chaotic in a good way (37:54 - 37:59)
maybe the problem was that uh was you (37:56 - 38:01)
were watching it you were late starting (37:59 - 38:03)
it and then you kept rewinding to look (38:01 - 38:05)
at things and comment on them rather (38:03 - 38:07)
than just watching it all in one go (38:05 - 38:09)
because i wanted it that's a big crab (38:07 - 38:11)
i've got to go back (38:09 - 38:14)
what is that i re-round it around it (38:11 - 38:16)
once (38:14 - 38:19)
who's that (38:16 - 38:19)
oh the car is back the car oh boy it's a (38:21 - 38:25)
car i ain't never seen a car no the (38:24 - 38:28)
car's a pokemon number one number two (38:25 - 38:31)
splatoon 3 also had the same issue with (38:28 - 38:33)
their recent trailers where they they (38:31 - 38:35)
just picked the worst music choice to (38:33 - 38:37)
run in the background and a car is a (38:35 - 38:38)
pokemon (38:37 - 38:40)
allegedly (38:38 - 38:41)
yes (38:40 - 38:43)
and it it (38:41 - 38:44)
there's somebody out there (38:43 - 38:46)
shaking their head up and down agreeing (38:44 - 38:47)
with me that that last splatoon 3 (38:46 - 38:50)
trailer was terrible so i will write to (38:47 - 38:52)
my uncle at nintendo and let him know (38:50 - 38:55)

will go to gyms in different locations (40:10 - 40:15)
to achieve the champion rank (40:12 - 40:18)
path of legends upperclassmen arvin will (40:15 - 40:20)
join players in the search of rare (40:18 - 40:22)
ingredients called (40:20 - 40:24)
herba mystica (40:22 - 40:27)
star fall street players will challenge (40:24 - 40:30)
team star a group of delinquents causing (40:27 - 40:31)
trouble i'm surprised they actually (40:30 - 40:32)
don't use the word thugs they love that (40:31 - 40:35)
word (40:32 - 40:36)
thugs is no longer acceptable yeah we (40:35 - 40:38)
don't use that word anymore (40:36 - 40:40)
that's like the first (40:38 - 40:42)
seven years of not seven years seven (40:40 - 40:44)
generations of pokemon games there used (40:42 - 40:46)
to be burglars in the game and they (40:44 - 40:48)
dumped them so like let's let's just (40:46 - 40:50)
used to be trainers with whips in the (40:48 - 40:53)
game let them grow and we have a trainer (40:50 - 40:55)
with the whip in the game again we do (40:53 - 40:57)
that is not a whip sir (40:55 - 41:00)
no that is a garden hose (40:57 - 41:02)
yeah sure (41:00 - 41:05)
he sprays water yeah (41:02 - 41:08)
you spray something (41:05 - 41:10)
uh they're delinquents causing trouble (41:08 - 41:12)
for the school (41:10 - 41:14)
these stories are set in a open world (41:12 - 41:16)
teeming with pokemon and people you meet (41:14 - 41:19)
so players can determine which path to (41:16 - 41:23)
take and explore however they desire (41:19 - 41:25)
so there's there's still a lot of (41:23 - 41:26)
questions here (41:25 - 41:28)
um are there (41:26 - 41:30)
i was like i didn't have a lot of (41:28 - 41:32)
questions well okay here here's a (41:30 - 41:33)
question (41:32 - 41:35)
i'll pose (41:33 - 41:37)
can i ignore (41:35 - 41:40)
path of legends and star fall street and (41:37 - 41:43)
just do the victory road story (41:40 - 41:45)
and get credits (41:43 - 41:48)
uh and then to piggyback on that (41:45 - 41:50)
question can i ignore victory road not (41:48 - 41:51)
do a single gym (41:50 - 41:54)
ignore path of legends ignore arvin can (41:51 - 41:57)
i just battle team star (41:54 - 41:59)
and get credits (41:57 - 42:02)
is is that what they're saying (41:59 - 42:03)
or what i (42:02 - 42:06)
what i shared earlier this week and what (42:03 - 42:07)
we shared what i've shared multiple (42:06 - 42:09)
times on the podcast this is just (42:07 - 42:11)
marketing this is (42:09 - 42:14)
this is this is every pokemon game every (42:11 - 42:16)
pokemon game is become champion delete (42:14 - 42:17)
the (42:16 - 42:20)
beat delete or beat the bad guys (42:17 - 42:22)
and figure out whatever (42:20 - 42:25)
legendary needs helping (42:22 - 42:27)
this this is every pokemon game in a (42:25 - 42:28)
nutshell (42:27 - 42:30)
well (42:28 - 42:31)
okay so (42:30 - 42:34)
i don't think herba mystica is whatever (42:31 - 42:37)
legendary needs helping but i do i think (42:34 - 42:40)
well it's called path path of legends (42:37 - 42:43)
that's fine i it's it's (42:40 - 42:44)
i think it's different (42:43 - 42:46)
um (42:44 - 42:48)
but yes i think you're right (42:46 - 42:50)
like every it's (42:48 - 42:51)
they're trying to say that there's (42:50 - 42:53)
they're they're they're exposing what's (42:51 - 42:56)
always been there there's three things (42:53 - 42:57)
yes (42:56 - 42:59)
which isn't like (42:57 - 43:00)
bad (42:59 - 43:03)
it's just that's every pokemon game i (43:00 - 43:04)
can't think of a pokemon game that (43:03 - 43:06)
doesn't have those three things (43:04 - 43:10)
even legends has those three things (43:06 - 43:11)
become (43:10 - 43:13)
well (43:11 - 43:15)
become champion is the equivalent (43:13 - 43:17)
equivalent of (43:15 - 43:19)
um (43:17 - 43:21)
doing the now they're not totems nobles (43:19 - 43:23)
the five nobles nobles yeah and then (43:21 - 43:26)
being like blessed to like meet arceus (43:23 - 43:28)
or whatever (43:26 - 43:31)
and then the bad guy is obviously (43:28 - 43:32)
the the (43:31 - 43:35)
could we spoil that at that point (43:32 - 43:36)
no (43:35 - 43:38)
you know who the bad guy is (43:36 - 43:42)
uh and then (43:38 - 43:44)
yeah (43:42 - 43:45)
legends is probably the farthest away (43:44 - 43:46)
from it but it still hits those like (43:45 - 43:49)
three main things you're doing (43:46 - 43:51)
i would say legends has a fourth one (43:49 - 43:52)
which is like (43:51 - 43:54)
collect everything but you do have to (43:52 - 43:57)
complete the pokedex right no other no (43:54 - 43:59)
no other pokemon game requires you to do (43:57 - 44:02)
that (43:59 - 44:02)
um (44:04 - 44:07)
okay we'll go through here (44:05 - 44:10)
uh players can have one pokemon out and (44:07 - 44:12)
walking with them uh (44:10 - 44:14)
in the paldeas region's great outdoors (44:12 - 44:16)
this was a huge complaint in sword and (44:14 - 44:19)
shield this is a talking point for a lot (44:16 - 44:21)
of pokemon games where if a pokemon (44:19 - 44:23)
isn't following me like in heart gold (44:21 - 44:26)
soul silver i am not interested (44:23 - 44:27)
obviously sorry (44:26 - 44:29)
they do nothing they just (44:27 - 44:31)
stand there and sometimes they glitch (44:29 - 44:35)
through objects or they run on water (44:31 - 44:37)
rather than swimming you know i don't i (44:35 - 44:38)
don't think the following pokemon in (44:37 - 44:41)
made bdsp a better game it did the this (44:38 - 44:44)
is pretty good (44:41 - 44:44)
if anyone tries to tell me bdsp is a (44:46 - 44:50)
good game i just show them atkins (44:48 - 44:52)
walking animation and they're like (44:50 - 44:54)
you're right this is a great game yeah (44:52 - 44:56)
exactly and i want to remind people that (44:54 - 44:58)
they did make a neckins walking (44:56 - 44:59)
animation it was very good it was in a (44:58 - 45:00)
game called let's go pikachu let's get (44:59 - 45:02)
it called brilliant shining pearl and (45:00 - 45:04)
they they could have just copy and (45:02 - 45:07)
pasted it ctrl c ctrl v (45:04 - 45:08)
when (45:07 - 45:10)
they have a pokemon exploring with them (45:08 - 45:12)
in a field there is a players can use (45:10 - 45:15)
the let's go feature to send a pokemon (45:12 - 45:17)
off in the direction they indicate (45:15 - 45:19)
the players will send out that pokemon (45:17 - 45:21)
it sends out the player that (45:19 - 45:23)
the pokemon the player sends out then (45:21 - 45:26)
independently picks up items in the area (45:23 - 45:29)
and auto battles with nearby pokemon i (45:26 - 45:30)
want to put this whole thing on pause (45:29 - 45:33)
and come back to that um (45:30 - 45:34)
because i actually don't really show (45:33 - 45:36)
that in the trailer um you have to like (45:34 - 45:38)
read the website for that or listen to (45:36 - 45:40)
this podcast (45:38 - 45:44)
more pokemon revealed in addition to (45:40 - 45:45)
new regional pokemon found you didn't (45:44 - 45:47)
show any new regional pokemon in this (45:45 - 45:48)
trailer why are you saying this in this (45:47 - 45:50)
press release uh different species of (45:48 - 45:52)
pokemon will appear depending on which (45:50 - 45:55)
game the player purchases (45:52 - 45:58)
arma rogue i'm maybe saying that wrong (45:55 - 46:01)
can be encountered pokemon scarlet cyril (45:58 - 46:02)
cerulledge (46:01 - 46:05)
can be encountered in pokemon violet (46:02 - 46:07)
arm arma rogue (46:05 - 46:10)
armor rogue's set of armor belonged to a (46:07 - 46:12)
distinguished warrior (46:10 - 46:14)
and its source of energy used for its (46:12 - 46:17)
psychic-type moves it also has the (46:14 - 46:19)
psychic capabilities of the armor to (46:17 - 46:22)
control fire energy within its body and (46:19 - 46:23)
unleash attacks somebody the pokemon (46:22 - 46:25)
company probably just watched avatar for (46:23 - 46:27)
the first time (46:25 - 46:28)
um (46:27 - 46:30)
it is the fire warrior pokemon it is (46:28 - 46:32)
fire psychic type it has the ability (46:30 - 46:34)
flash fire i think (46:32 - 46:36)
although i've been wrong before the only (46:34 - 46:38)
fire psychic pokemon prior to this has (46:36 - 46:43)
been victini and has been del fox (46:38 - 46:43)
one of them is probably psychic fire so (46:44 - 46:49)
now you're in trouble (46:46 - 46:51)
i'm confused you say they they didn't (46:49 - 46:52)
show any new regional pokemon and then (46:51 - 46:54)
you just (46:52 - 46:56)
said the names of two new regional (46:54 - 46:58)
pokemon so what are you talking about (46:56 - 47:00)
original pokemon not (46:58 - 47:02)
like whooper (47:00 - 47:04)
no (47:02 - 47:05)
no (47:04 - 47:07)
regional forms got it my bad i was (47:05 - 47:09)
thinking forums (47:07 - 47:12)
because there were some people that (47:09 - 47:14)
thought that these were (47:12 - 47:15)
regio (47:14 - 47:19)
regional bi-sharps yes yeah (47:15 - 47:19)
yes bisharp was also if people like look (47:20 - 47:24)
at these pokemon and they're like oh (47:23 - 47:26)
they look like samus or mega man or (47:24 - 47:29)
digimon or whatever it's like (47:26 - 47:31)
it doesn't really look that different (47:29 - 47:33)
from like meg mortar or bishop or like (47:31 - 47:35)
scyther or scissor like there are (47:33 - 47:37)
already so many pokemon that like have (47:35 - 47:40)
this i mean you could go very basic and (47:37 - 47:42)
say humanoid form but there are so many (47:40 - 47:44)
pokemon that have giant weapons on their (47:42 - 47:48)
arms i don't know like cleavor (47:44 - 47:48)
i i don't know who that (47:49 - 47:52)
is um (47:51 - 47:54)
[Music] (47:52 - 47:57)
surul edge dons an old set of armor (47:54 - 48:00)
steeped in grudges and wields blades (47:57 - 48:03)
from fire and ghost energy in battles (48:00 - 48:05)
these blades turn into great swords to (48:03 - 48:08)
increase the surreal edge's power (48:05 - 48:10)
cuts from these great swords will leave (48:08 - 48:11)
wounds which (48:10 - 48:13)
uh life energy will flow (48:11 - 48:16)
this is the fire blades pokemon it is (48:13 - 48:18)
fire ghost (48:16 - 48:21)
uh it is 5'3 it has a 136 pounds both (48:18 - 48:24)
these pokemon's ability are flash fire (48:21 - 48:25)
um (48:24 - 48:27)
the only fire ghost that i can think of (48:25 - 48:29)
right now is the chandeleur line (48:27 - 48:31)
although they could be ghost fire (48:29 - 48:34)
actually lola and marowak oh yeah (48:31 - 48:35)
good good call (48:34 - 48:38)
i'm just gonna say that i personally (48:35 - 48:40)
feel a strong connection (48:38 - 48:43)
to sir allege because i too don sets of (48:40 - 48:46)
armor seeped in grudges every day and (48:43 - 48:50)
let it carry me through my life true (48:46 - 48:50)
i think these pokemon are cool (48:52 - 48:56)
i like them i mean i like but i don't (48:54 - 48:58)
like personally like them but i do think (48:56 - 49:01)
they're cool i i i mean i like i like (48:58 - 49:03)
the boots like this game is quickly (49:01 - 49:05)
becoming about boots for me (49:03 - 49:06)
um (49:05 - 49:08)
and i (49:06 - 49:09)
given the fact that it's still a 0 out (49:08 - 49:12)
of 10 game i am excited for actually (49:09 - 49:16)
like it's it's rare that i like both (49:12 - 49:19)
sort of unique (49:16 - 49:20)
pseudo whatever these are going to be (49:19 - 49:21)
suitable legendaries you think this is (49:20 - 49:22)
going to be suitable potentially (49:21 - 49:24)
legendaries i don't know they made a big (49:22 - 49:27)
deal out of them and so (49:24 - 49:28)
i feel like (49:27 - 49:30)
they're they're potentially good i like (49:28 - 49:32)
both of them quite a lot i like their (49:30 - 49:34)
design i didn't think about that (49:32 - 49:37)
i didn't think i didn't think lead (49:34 - 49:39)
i didn't get legendary vibes from these (49:37 - 49:41)
pokemon (49:39 - 49:44)
i don't even think i get like (49:41 - 49:46)
hershey food vibes from these pokemon i (49:44 - 49:47)
mean hershey food is a legendary but (49:46 - 49:49)
like (49:47 - 49:51)
it's like a story legendary like make a (49:49 - 49:52)
big deal about it in the story i just (49:51 - 49:57)
have a feeling like this is a this is a (49:52 - 49:57)
like do you get lucario vibes from this (49:58 - 50:02)
i get one well i get lucario vibes i get (50:00 - 50:06)
um vulcarona vibes like there was (50:02 - 50:08)
the one in the basement (50:06 - 50:11)
like i get that vibe where it is a very (50:08 - 50:12)
limited very (50:11 - 50:16)
the one in the basement yeah oh (50:12 - 50:18)
man let's just (50:16 - 50:21)
reduce the story of volcarona to its (50:18 - 50:25)
most basic components (50:21 - 50:25)
so (50:30 - 50:35)
i would disagree i think the the reason (50:32 - 50:37)
that these were (50:35 - 50:38)
featured (50:37 - 50:41)
was just to make it very clear that hey (50:38 - 50:44)
once again we have version exclusives (50:41 - 50:46)
this is an example of a version (50:44 - 50:49)
exclusive that you'll have to choose by (50:46 - 50:52)
which game that you choose to play (50:49 - 50:55)
i agree with will but also adding the (50:52 - 50:56)
the (50:55 - 50:59)
extra point of they haven't shown cool (50:56 - 51:01)
pokemon (50:59 - 51:03)
small live lechonk (51:01 - 51:05)
fido (51:03 - 51:07)
i can't remember the other ones like (51:05 - 51:10)
none of those are cool (51:07 - 51:10)
like well okay le chunk is cool but like (51:10 - 51:15)
wow quacksley (51:13 - 51:18)
quacksley isn't cool (51:15 - 51:19)
but but (51:18 - 51:21)
miraidon aren't cool quacksley thinks (51:19 - 51:23)
he's cool (51:21 - 51:25)
but (51:23 - 51:26)
isn't (51:25 - 51:28)
cool but but pokemon does a really good (51:26 - 51:32)
job at having like like like i i took me (51:28 - 51:34)
really long to figure out that like i (51:32 - 51:37)
like really derpy pokemon like that's (51:34 - 51:39)
why i originally liked farfetch so much (51:37 - 51:41)
when i was a kid it's like why i like (51:39 - 51:42)
kramer ant now (51:41 - 51:44)
um (51:42 - 51:45)
and (51:44 - 51:47)
as much as people (51:45 - 51:48)
hate (51:47 - 51:51)
that the pokemon company (51:48 - 51:52)
i wouldn't even say like they need to (51:51 - 51:54)
rely on charizard it's just that (51:52 - 51:57)
charizards and like and universally (51:54 - 51:59)
liked pokemon and like charizard doesn't (51:57 - 52:01)
fall under that derpy situation (51:59 - 52:02)
charizard falls under the cool situation (52:01 - 52:05)
he he is the cool pokemon (52:02 - 52:07)
um same as greninja you would easily (52:05 - 52:10)
argue grinning is a very cool pokemon (52:07 - 52:12)
uh (52:10 - 52:13)
and i (52:12 - 52:16)
can't think of (52:13 - 52:18)
a cool pokemon they've shown for scarlet (52:16 - 52:20)
violet now like here here they are here (52:18 - 52:21)
are the here are the cool ones for the (52:20 - 52:22)
people that are like all of these (52:21 - 52:24)
pokemon are are (52:22 - 52:26)
too (52:24 - 52:29)
squishy (52:26 - 52:29)
too huggable i mean if that's what's (52:32 - 52:37)
important to people sure (52:34 - 52:37)
yes they've been featuring a lot of the (52:39 - 52:43)
i would have these as a pet pokemon (52:41 - 52:45)
versus the this is my (52:43 - 52:47)
battle ready (52:45 - 52:49)
companion what i'm hearing is we're (52:47 - 52:51)
finally all admitting that the titan is (52:49 - 52:53)
super cute and squishy and lovable oh i (52:51 - 52:55)
would give citation a big ol hug yeah i (52:53 - 52:57)
guess the titan would be the one that (52:55 - 52:59)
would be (52:57 - 53:02)
super cute and squishy and lovable (52:59 - 53:04)
sure yeah (53:02 - 53:06)
so titan's another cute pokemon hey they (53:04 - 53:09)
showed off cloth (53:06 - 53:09)
cloth can rotate their protruding (53:09 - 53:14)
eyeballs to see everything around them (53:11 - 53:16)
eliminating all their blind spots they (53:14 - 53:18)
latch onto the they latch upside down (53:16 - 53:20)
onto cliffs to ambush their prey from (53:18 - 53:22)
above however they eventually get dizzy (53:20 - 53:24)
from the blood rushing to their heads (53:22 - 53:26)
they cannot stay upside down for very (53:24 - 53:27)
long (53:26 - 53:29)
they're known as the ambush pokemon (53:27 - 53:31)
they're rock type (53:29 - 53:33)
uh they weigh 174 pounds which is (53:31 - 53:36)
incredibly light for a rock that hangs (53:33 - 53:38)
on the wall like i just want to (53:36 - 53:40)
only 40 pounds (53:38 - 53:44)
174 pounds that's not light (53:40 - 53:46)
how is that light the giant rock crab (53:44 - 53:49)
that's more than you weigh that's true (53:46 - 53:50)
and it's awesome (53:49 - 53:53)
a rock how many heights is it (53:50 - 53:56)
443. (53:53 - 53:56)
ah (53:57 - 54:00)
how many heights is it (53:58 - 54:02)
well look last week he said its weight (54:00 - 54:04)
is two foot four please don't tell don't (54:02 - 54:07)
think i missed that (54:04 - 54:07)
i don't remember that which weight was (54:08 - 54:10)
that (54:09 - 54:12)
when did the six (54:10 - 54:14)
six point one inches thing happened (54:12 - 54:16)
instead of (54:14 - 54:20)
one i think four three at 174 pounds is (54:16 - 54:22)
is pretty hefty here's the question do i (54:20 - 54:26)
add this to my tracking chart is now (54:22 - 54:29)
clump my new my new goal (54:26 - 54:33)
is your goal it's your benchmark (54:29 - 54:33)
uh people (54:34 - 54:39)
seem to like cloth a lot (54:36 - 54:41)
yeah because when you saw it you're like (54:39 - 54:45)
it's a crab yeah (54:41 - 54:45)
i mean i did say that (54:45 - 54:48)
i am just (54:49 - 54:54)
curious if (54:51 - 54:54)
the giant (54:55 - 54:59)
one they shown is the range of size that (54:56 - 55:02)
can happen in game or if they're hinting (54:59 - 55:05)
that um there will be some giant boss (55:02 - 55:07)
size things or (55:05 - 55:09)
that's that's what i'm saying is the (55:07 - 55:12)
herba mystic line is that he's going to (55:09 - 55:14)
take you to all these places because (55:12 - 55:15)
they said the titans (55:14 - 55:18)
yes and so you're it's a titan version (55:15 - 55:21)
of it which is very much like the raids (55:18 - 55:22)
where it's going to be a like not (55:21 - 55:25)
dynamics it's going to be titan (55:22 - 55:26)
is this like (55:25 - 55:28)
a style of alpha do we think (55:26 - 55:30)
something like that yeah (55:28 - 55:33)
or like the the lords (55:30 - 55:35)
nobles nobles nobles (55:33 - 55:39)
or totems those those were things too (55:35 - 55:42)
yeah yeah so real quick uh before we get (55:39 - 55:43)
to the totem stuff um (55:42 - 55:44)
uh (55:43 - 55:46)
there is a new ability here the (55:44 - 55:48)
abilities anger shell cloth's anger (55:46 - 55:49)
shell ability is making its first (55:48 - 55:51)
appearance in the pokemon series when (55:49 - 55:53)
cloth's hp drops to half or less the (55:51 - 55:56)
pokemon gets angry it lowers its defense (55:53 - 55:58)
and special defense but it will boost (55:56 - 56:00)
its attack special attack and speed (55:58 - 56:01)
stats (56:00 - 56:01)
so (56:01 - 56:05)
ultimately it's a built-in shell smash (56:01 - 56:06)
uh which (56:05 - 56:09)
shell smash has been pretty good (56:06 - 56:10)
in both singles and double battles (56:09 - 56:13)
depending on on who is using it uh (56:10 - 56:17)
probably more used in singles (56:13 - 56:20)
um but shell smash blastoise did make (56:17 - 56:23)
some waves no pun intended uh (56:20 - 56:24)
in (56:23 - 56:28)
in doubles for at least one series (56:24 - 56:31)
uh (56:28 - 56:31)
the thing about cloth is they they did (56:31 - 56:36)
use the word titan and they showed a (56:34 - 56:37)
cloth that was like what four times (56:36 - 56:40)
bigger very big um (56:37 - 56:43)
and the i guess the the unanswered (56:40 - 56:47)
question here is are titans the same as (56:43 - 56:50)
alpha pokemon (56:47 - 56:50)
where (56:50 - 56:53)
or the well i wouldn't say the same as (56:51 - 56:55)
dynamics because dynamics is like a (56:53 - 56:57)
projection (56:55 - 56:59)
uh but we also got totem pokemon in sun (56:57 - 57:01)
and moon (56:59 - 57:01)
and (57:02 - 57:09)
does that mean we can bring in our alpha (57:04 - 57:09)
la punny (57:10 - 57:14)
into this game and then it will be (57:11 - 57:16)
a bigger lap honey (57:14 - 57:20)
that is what i'm hoping uh is is (57:16 - 57:24)
the alpha slash totem slash (57:20 - 57:25)
titan (57:24 - 57:28)
are they all the same can i bring in a (57:25 - 57:31)
totem pokemon from (57:28 - 57:32)
ultrasound ultra moon and will it be (57:31 - 57:34)
bigger like (57:32 - 57:37)
i mean i hope i hope that is a is what (57:34 - 57:39)
that means right like i hope that (57:37 - 57:42)
now that we have a game that connects to (57:39 - 57:44)
bank we've had totems they kind of just (57:42 - 57:45)
sat there because you couldn't really do (57:44 - 57:47)
anything with them i'm hoping that this (57:45 - 57:50)
is a way to bring those (57:47 - 57:52)
oversized (57:50 - 57:53)
extra large (57:52 - 57:54)
whatever (57:53 - 57:57)
into this game and perhaps into games (57:54 - 57:59)
going forward like i do hope it means (57:57 - 58:01)
that if you bring them in they retain (57:59 - 58:04)
that size (58:01 - 58:06)
yeah i hope so too i'm i'm confused why (58:04 - 58:08)
we we keep using different names like (58:06 - 58:10)
they made big pokemon and they called (58:08 - 58:12)
them totem and then they made big (58:10 - 58:13)
pokemon again and then they called them (58:12 - 58:15)
dynamics and then gigantomax and then (58:13 - 58:17)
well those big pokemon projections and (58:15 - 58:20)
then they made alphas (58:17 - 58:24)
but they also they do different things (58:20 - 58:26)
they're just big but they're just (58:24 - 58:28)
they're different story-wise they are (58:26 - 58:30)
different totems guard like or the (58:28 - 58:32)
island guardian well they're not the (58:30 - 58:34)
island guardians but they like represent (58:32 - 58:36)
the the trials (58:34 - 58:39)
for the island and then the alphas are (58:36 - 58:41)
in the field (58:39 - 58:43)
like kind of like roll a random (58:41 - 58:45)
die almost to get whether it's going to (58:43 - 58:46)
be enough i don't think there's going to (58:45 - 58:48)
be titans just (58:46 - 58:50)
like us no i i think the titans are (58:48 - 58:53)
going to be like nobles and the cook (58:50 - 58:55)
dude is going to take you to each one as (58:53 - 58:58)
part of his storyline (58:55 - 59:00)
to you'll go through a series of the (58:58 - 59:03)
titans that you have to defeat to do (59:00 - 59:05)
a storyline i agree that they are locked (59:03 - 59:07)
behind the storyline and i think once (59:05 - 59:09)
you complete that legendary storyline (59:07 - 59:11)
they may start appearing in the field (59:09 - 59:12)
but then it'll be like rates yeah and (59:11 - 59:15)
that's how they'll do raids (59:12 - 59:19)
no raids are the crystals you touch (59:15 - 59:22)
they also had the big uh gardevoir that (59:19 - 59:24)
was like bigger than everybody else (59:22 - 59:26)
when they showed off the raids yeah so (59:24 - 59:28)
is that is that just not a titan (59:26 - 59:29)
gardevoir they just haven't they just (59:28 - 59:32)
didn't use the word titan yet it is a (59:29 - 59:35)
titan gardevoir that is a raid (59:32 - 59:37)
that unlocks after you finish the herb (59:35 - 59:39)
of mystic okay but like if you defeat (59:37 - 59:41)
the titan guard award does she shrink (59:39 - 59:42)
like (59:41 - 59:45)
i don't know dynamaxx or (59:42 - 59:48)
is are you catching an alpha version of (59:45 - 59:52)
that in like legends yeah that's unknown (59:48 - 59:52)
yeah i guess the biggest question is (59:55 - 59:58)
like if i bring in my alpha sneezeler (59:56 - 60:00)
which should be able to come back in (59:58 - 60:01)
because they finally showed off sneasel (60:00 - 60:03)
and weavile in this game (60:01 - 60:05)
is it going to be alpha (60:03 - 60:08)
because a huge part of why i slowed it (60:05 - 60:11)
down playing legends is is kind of the (60:08 - 60:14)
same (60:11 - 60:14)
with (60:15 - 60:18)
um (60:16 - 60:20)
it's not a it's not a huge reason but (60:18 - 60:21)
like (60:20 - 60:22)
would it be cool to collect all the (60:21 - 60:25)
totem pokemon in sun and moon and ultra (60:22 - 60:26)
sun and moon yeah with two of them are (60:25 - 60:28)
broken they they they can't even get (60:26 - 60:30)
transferred to bank for whatever reason (60:28 - 60:33)
i think it's like marowak and (60:30 - 60:34)
uh (60:33 - 60:35)
the (60:34 - 60:37)
fomantis or something like they just (60:35 - 60:38)
can't transfer it just doesn't let you (60:37 - 60:41)
transfer them the other six that you (60:38 - 60:44)
transfer you can't do anything with them (60:41 - 60:46)
so like if i'm going to spend (60:44 - 60:48)
hundreds of hours (60:46 - 60:51)
shiny hunting alpha pokemon or even (60:48 - 60:53)
collecting an alpha dex (60:51 - 60:56)
that sure in pokemon home it it says (60:53 - 60:58)
they're alpha and that's that's nice (60:56 - 60:59)
that's cool (60:58 - 61:01)
but if they if if i move them into a (60:59 - 61:03)
future game and they just go small again (61:01 - 61:05)
or the game is going to be like well you (61:03 - 61:06)
can't move these over they're too big (61:05 - 61:09)
they don't fit through the transfer pipe (61:06 - 61:12)
then why am i collecting them (61:09 - 61:14)
the transfer pipe (61:12 - 61:16)
for the joy of the challenge of having (61:14 - 61:19)
defeated an alpha yeah yeah (61:16 - 61:23)
um sometimes the experience is the (61:19 - 61:27)
reward you needed all along (61:23 - 61:27)
i don't know if that's true is true (61:27 - 61:34)
they showed some new characters (61:32 - 61:36)
uh they did boots boots boots boots (61:34 - 61:37)
boots (61:36 - 61:38)
they showed (61:37 - 61:40)
brassius (61:38 - 61:44)
brasius is the gym leader of uh artisan (61:40 - 61:47)
a town alive with flowers and art he (61:44 - 61:49)
specializes in using grass type pokemon (61:47 - 61:53)
and is known as the verdant version (61:49 - 61:56)
verdant virtuoso yes yeah that's what i (61:53 - 61:58)
said that dude confused me the first (61:56 - 62:01)
time i saw it because it just the name (61:58 - 62:02)
wasn't on the screen long enough and i (62:01 - 62:05)
was like it's a brass type generator are (62:02 - 62:06)
they not doing (62:05 - 62:08)
types and it's he's going to have (62:06 - 62:11)
whatever pokemon he wants and then you (62:08 - 62:13)
cannot tell me from that artwork (62:11 - 62:17)
that that is not a whip (62:13 - 62:21)
he sprays water on the pseudo wudo to (62:17 - 62:23)
crystallize him (62:21 - 62:28)
i don't like this guy at all what (62:23 - 62:31)
he's moody and cool he's the finally a (62:28 - 62:32)
cool (62:31 - 62:33)
trainer we've seen okay yeah but if he (62:32 - 62:35)
was 10 years younger he would just be an (62:33 - 62:37)
edgelord but because he's an old guy (62:35 - 62:38)
instead of using the word edgelord (62:37 - 62:40)
they're just like ah now he's moody yeah (62:38 - 62:41)
that's the same that's what they say (62:40 - 62:43)
about me every day (62:41 - 62:46)
that's that's how this works (62:43 - 62:48)
when you don't have a good excuse to be (62:46 - 62:49)
an edge lord because you're a teen and (62:48 - 62:51)
don't know better and you do it as an (62:49 - 62:54)
adult you're just moody (62:51 - 62:54)
um (62:55 - 62:58)
what was i gonna say (62:56 - 63:00)
tag nabbit (62:58 - 63:03)
you took it right out of my mouth (63:00 - 63:05)
brass type gym leader (63:03 - 63:08)
he has the pseudo widow he has the uh (63:05 - 63:11)
small live smaller yeah why did they not (63:08 - 63:13)
show his rosary no um (63:11 - 63:16)
he reminds me of who (63:13 - 63:17)
because he didn't he doesn't have (63:16 - 63:20)
rosarito he has sunflora let's be clear (63:17 - 63:22)
here gym leader in (63:20 - 63:23)
castellia city (63:22 - 63:26)
castellia oh berg (63:23 - 63:28)
yeah that's he gives me those vibes he's (63:26 - 63:31)
like i give you vibes yeah because yeah (63:28 - 63:33)
berg was an artist he's a tortured (63:31 - 63:35)
artist you can see it in his eyes (63:33 - 63:37)
he's never completely that's a trope for (63:35 - 63:38)
every artist (63:37 - 63:40)
mina vila (63:38 - 63:41)
berg (63:40 - 63:44)
they're all just like aquifer in (63:41 - 63:46)
photographer's an artist (63:44 - 63:49)
but she wasn't tortured she was like (63:46 - 63:51)
the happy one (63:49 - 63:52)
i mean if you if you're mina and you're (63:51 - 63:54)
walking in the middle of cliffs by (63:52 - 63:56)
yourself being like i don't know what (63:54 - 63:57)
life is i don't want to be a gym leader (63:56 - 63:59)
like you're you're under the same trope (63:57 - 64:01)
as this dude right here (63:59 - 64:04)
brassius something else i have in common (64:01 - 64:05)
with them (64:04 - 64:07)
both of them i feel like that's unfair (64:05 - 64:10)
to mena i think (64:07 - 64:11)
just because (64:10 - 64:15)
all those who wander are not lost (64:11 - 64:16)
true (64:15 - 64:18)
yeah but if she got that new apple watch (64:16 - 64:20)
ultra she would be lost she could use (64:18 - 64:22)
set the waypoints to go (64:20 - 64:24)
backwards we are not we are we will (64:22 - 64:29)
cover that event in a separate podcast (64:24 - 64:30)
we right now we have another trailer (64:29 - 64:32)
that we are focusing on and we need to (64:30 - 64:33)
talk (64:32 - 64:35)
about (64:33 - 64:37)
mila's boots (64:35 - 64:41)
uh mela is the boss of team star's fire (64:37 - 64:42)
crew (64:41 - 64:45)
the s the skel skelter squad (64:42 - 64:47)
the fact (64:45 - 64:50)
that she does not have a sarina (64:47 - 64:52)
in that for that was a crime (64:50 - 64:54)
oh it is a crime (64:52 - 64:57)
but she's fire she's fire so (64:54 - 65:00)
oh but but but but she's going to have a (64:57 - 65:04)
serena that tara crystallizes to fire (65:00 - 65:05)
yes (65:04 - 65:07)
and they're at the same boots also what (65:05 - 65:10)
what is the name of the okay (65:07 - 65:13)
i'm very confused okay i'm here (65:10 - 65:15)
say the name of the team again (65:13 - 65:17)
team star (65:15 - 65:20)
no no you just said the skeller squad or (65:17 - 65:22)
mella is the boss of team star's fire (65:20 - 65:23)
crew (65:22 - 65:24)
as of (65:23 - 65:26)
so we're assuming there's a grass crew (65:24 - 65:28)
uh electric crew (65:26 - 65:31)
fairy crew and the crews have their own (65:28 - 65:33)
names correct yes (65:31 - 65:36)
that's dumb yeah (65:33 - 65:39)
so does that mean okay so our (65:36 - 65:40)
this is my question to you guys i'm (65:39 - 65:41)
asking a lot of questions not getting a (65:40 - 65:43)
lot of answers well what do you what (65:41 - 65:45)
what answers we're gonna give but no i (65:43 - 65:48)
mean my uncle has been very quiet about (65:45 - 65:50)
rhetorical these are rhetorical (65:48 - 65:51)
questions they don't have answers and (65:50 - 65:53)
then you're going to say why aren't you (65:51 - 65:54)
giving me you just said why didn't you (65:53 - 65:57)
give me the answer to all your answers (65:54 - 66:00)
rhetorical questions answer themselves (65:57 - 66:02)
yeah oh okay well these are questions (66:00 - 66:04)
without answers here's here's the (66:02 - 66:06)
question without the answer (66:04 - 66:08)
do you think they're going to pull a (66:06 - 66:12)
nurse joy situation here (66:08 - 66:13)
and (66:12 - 66:15)
because that we're assuming there are (66:13 - 66:18)
multiple teams based on the sentence (66:15 - 66:20)
mella is the boss of team star's fire (66:18 - 66:21)
crew (66:20 - 66:23)
so if there is a water crew are they (66:21 - 66:26)
just going to make a blue version of her (66:23 - 66:28)
and put her on top of the car no no do (66:26 - 66:30)
you think they're going to actually make (66:28 - 66:32)
different characters they're gonna make (66:30 - 66:34)
different characters pitbull will be (66:32 - 66:37)
featured in this game now that pokemon (66:34 - 66:39)
masters hat is a thing they need to make (66:37 - 66:42)
as many characters and load up that game (66:39 - 66:43)
as possible (66:42 - 66:46)
here's what i want this is the perfect (66:43 - 66:48)
time for mirror b (66:46 - 66:50)
to come back (66:48 - 66:50)
i mean even silent chili and cress had (66:51 - 66:56)
their own look and personality (66:54 - 66:58)
yeah (66:56 - 67:00)
i didn't know that there's gonna be 18 (66:58 - 67:02)
squads i have a feeling there's going to (67:00 - 67:05)
be three i have a firewater grass (67:02 - 67:06)
why eight (67:05 - 67:09)
eight gyms eight squads (67:06 - 67:11)
they love that number (67:09 - 67:15)
they also love the number three (67:11 - 67:15)
yeah but if this is a whole storyline (67:15 - 67:21)
you kind of have to flesh it out like (67:19 - 67:23)
like let's go back to part of it fast (67:21 - 67:28)
have you played a pokemon game before (67:23 - 67:28)
i'm not buying this (67:34 - 67:38)
okay so i we can either be pessimistic (67:38 - 67:43)
that's the basic yes and and assume that (67:41 - 67:46)
this is all just marketing (67:43 - 67:47)
and that even though they say that there (67:46 - 67:50)
are three storylines the only storyline (67:47 - 67:51)
that matters is the eight gyms and (67:50 - 67:54)
that's the only way to get credits (67:51 - 67:56)
because that is why is everybody's focus (67:54 - 67:59)
on credits credits mean you just saw who (67:56 - 68:00)
made the game and i can look that up (67:59 - 68:01)
online (68:00 - 68:03)
yeah because people get credits and then (68:01 - 68:04)
they're done and then they go back to (68:03 - 68:06)
four right but if the credits happen (68:04 - 68:08)
they're never done correct (68:06 - 68:11)
um (68:08 - 68:12)
so if (68:11 - 68:15)
this is truly three story lines and we (68:12 - 68:17)
know for sure there are eight gyms (68:15 - 68:18)
because that's what they said (68:17 - 68:21)
there's eight gyms victory road then the (68:18 - 68:24)
champion if i ignore all the gyms and i (68:21 - 68:26)
want to focus on team star do i just (68:24 - 68:28)
beat three team star members then i get (68:26 - 68:31)
quote unquote credits am i done (68:28 - 68:34)
or not how the evil team works dude or (68:31 - 68:37)
are there are there eight (68:34 - 68:39)
team star members that (68:37 - 68:41)
maybe exist around this open world map (68:39 - 68:43)
no and then i want to piggyback that (68:41 - 68:46)
question off arvin if arvin is what's (68:43 - 68:48)
leading you to (68:46 - 68:51)
tighten pokemon (68:48 - 68:53)
and we know in like ultrasound ultra (68:51 - 68:56)
moon there was eight totem pokemon (68:53 - 68:59)
is there going to be eight (68:56 - 69:01)
titan pokemon one of them being cloth we (68:59 - 69:03)
know that now that are going to exist (69:01 - 69:06)
around the map now there were two (69:03 - 69:07)
they don't there were five we can look (69:06 - 69:09)
at other things (69:07 - 69:11)
like contests there aren't eight (69:09 - 69:12)
contests (69:11 - 69:13)
true (69:12 - 69:16)
there aren't eight they don't always (69:13 - 69:20)
make everything matchy matchy so (69:16 - 69:22)
there are 151 (69:20 - 69:25)
cooking recipes (69:22 - 69:25)
you gotta get that golden ladle (69:27 - 69:30)
um i could i i could see something along (69:34 - 69:41)
contest like five like it depends on (69:37 - 69:44)
honestly the biggest question is (69:41 - 69:46)
how long did they want to make each of (69:44 - 69:51)
these story lines and i don't know (69:46 - 69:51)
because it does look like the in front (69:51 - 69:55)
of every gym there's going to be some (69:53 - 69:58)
sort of trial like they did in sword and (69:55 - 70:00)
shield right like yes find the sun flora (69:58 - 70:03)
or (70:00 - 70:03)
there were like little (70:05 - 70:09)
simpler trials but they were like do (70:07 - 70:11)
this to battle gym leader (70:09 - 70:13)
so the question (70:11 - 70:15)
it's hard to know like i could see them (70:13 - 70:17)
doing five squats i could see them doing (70:15 - 70:19)
three squats for the base because that's (70:17 - 70:22)
the starter trio and it would match with (70:19 - 70:24)
here's the three sections of the rival (70:22 - 70:26)
team it matches the choices you had to (70:24 - 70:27)
make the beginning like there's (70:26 - 70:29)
arguments for all of them (70:27 - 70:30)
i do think (70:29 - 70:32)
that (70:30 - 70:34)
like gym battles are very (70:32 - 70:37)
straightforward there's not a lot of (70:34 - 70:39)
story that really goes around gyms (70:37 - 70:40)
and (70:39 - 70:42)
story lines can get extended when you're (70:40 - 70:43)
dealing with (70:42 - 70:45)
this is (70:43 - 70:46)
a (70:45 - 70:48)
delinquent team and you're stopping what (70:46 - 70:50)
they're doing in this town and then (70:48 - 70:52)
you're stopping what they're doing in (70:50 - 70:54)
this town so (70:52 - 70:57)
for the delinquent evil whatever teams (70:54 - 70:59)
you want to call them the nerdy wells (70:57 - 71:03)
they tend to limit how many (70:59 - 71:03)
people are at the top because you run (71:03 - 71:08)
into them in multiple areas right like (71:06 - 71:10)
you'll run into their lieutenants and (71:08 - 71:12)
then you'll hit the the big one so i (71:10 - 71:14)
don't think they're gonna have eight (71:12 - 71:17)
squads but i do think like three seems (71:14 - 71:18)
plausible (71:17 - 71:20)
and you're stopping each of their (71:18 - 71:22)
machinations that various parts (71:20 - 71:23)
throughout the world so you're running (71:22 - 71:26)
into their lower members and then you go (71:23 - 71:28)
to their boss which is a very different (71:26 - 71:30)
journey than (71:28 - 71:31)
the just go to a gym leader take on the (71:30 - 71:34)
gym and get the badge yeah this this is (71:31 - 71:35)
the story story (71:34 - 71:38)
this is like right it's this isn't the (71:35 - 71:40)
i have to get stronger pokemon so i can (71:38 - 71:42)
battle and have a strategy for gym (71:40 - 71:44)
leaders it's not the (71:42 - 71:46)
whatever the finding the different (71:44 - 71:48)
titans is going to get you this is this (71:46 - 71:49)
is going to be the story that gets you (71:48 - 71:51)
to whatever the legendary is going to be (71:49 - 71:53)
at the end (71:51 - 71:56)
and it's since it's an evil team it's (71:53 - 71:57)
gonna do what they've done with evil (71:56 - 72:00)
teams before and right what you noticed (71:57 - 72:03)
was that they set up some sort of (72:00 - 72:05)
mad max barrier (72:03 - 72:08)
to a location that you're trying to go (72:05 - 72:10)
to so it's like (72:08 - 72:12)
whatever is motivating you on your (72:10 - 72:15)
treasure hunt to travel around which (72:12 - 72:17)
that really hasn't been revealed other (72:15 - 72:19)
than the treasure hunt is the (72:17 - 72:21)
independent study of your school (72:19 - 72:22)
like you're going to have to get (72:21 - 72:23)
someplace they're going to have to (72:22 - 72:25)
they're going to set up a (72:23 - 72:28)
what was the bad guy team from (72:25 - 72:30)
sword and shield uh (72:28 - 72:32)
team hawk tamiel well team yellow wasn't (72:30 - 72:36)
technically the bad guys (72:32 - 72:37)
right (72:36 - 72:39)
these are just these are students see (72:37 - 72:42)
marco polo or whatever that right that (72:39 - 72:44)
was literally never mentioned so you're (72:42 - 72:47)
gonna find that one of the faculty in (72:44 - 72:50)
the school is telling these students hey (72:47 - 72:51)
i'll give you extra credit if you (72:50 - 72:53)
obstruct (72:51 - 72:55)
this independent study student who seems (72:53 - 72:56)
to be (72:55 - 72:58)
going towards the legendary that i'm (72:56 - 73:00)
trying to capture (72:58 - 73:02)
and so that's why and then eventually (73:00 - 73:04)
like you'll you'll do some of the team (73:02 - 73:06)
stars but then you're gonna get yeah up (73:04 - 73:07)
to the lieutenants and ultimately (73:06 - 73:09)
probably battle one of the faculty who's (73:07 - 73:11)
gonna be the bad guy my real question (73:09 - 73:14)
about this is (73:11 - 73:15)
is it (73:14 - 73:17)
because it was really not clear it's (73:15 - 73:19)
like are they from the same school as (73:17 - 73:21)
you is there only one school in the (73:19 - 73:23)
region or are they like if i'm a naranja (73:21 - 73:26)
are they going to be in (73:23 - 73:30)
the egg not the egg the grape (73:26 - 73:30)
right is that how that's going to work (73:31 - 73:36)
out (73:34 - 73:36)
um (73:37 - 73:39)
yeah i (73:38 - 73:42)
[Music] (73:39 - 73:42)
obviously mella is (73:43 - 73:48)
not (73:46 - 73:51)
the giovanni not the lysander (73:48 - 73:52)
at least that's okay that's what they're (73:51 - 73:56)
saying here right um (73:52 - 73:59)
maybe she's like the plumeria maybe is (73:56 - 74:02)
yeah i mean (73:59 - 74:02)
they haven't shown much but i do think (74:03 - 74:06)
like (74:05 - 74:09)
that this this (74:06 - 74:09)
it feels like (74:10 - 74:15)
a like courtney uh (74:12 - 74:18)
who's uh a mat for maxie and archie and (74:15 - 74:21)
all them like they're they're second in (74:18 - 74:22)
command these all feel like second in (74:21 - 74:25)
commands they're a big deal but it is (74:22 - 74:27)
leading towards something else and i (74:25 - 74:29)
would be surprised if they're like we (74:27 - 74:31)
have eight lieutenants that you have to (74:29 - 74:33)
deal with although i mean gatsas did (74:31 - 74:35)
have (74:33 - 74:36)
trouble getting a lot of people he had a (74:35 - 74:39)
bunch of sages (74:36 - 74:39)
and then yeah but we won't have to do (74:39 - 74:42)
anything with them they just sat there (74:40 - 74:44)
and looked at you disapprovingly well (74:42 - 74:47)
well the the the point about the and (74:44 - 74:48)
will as probably the only person in the (74:47 - 74:50)
podcast that did this is like you beat (74:48 - 74:52)
black and white and then you go out and (74:50 - 74:55)
you find the catch those sages man (74:52 - 74:56)
they're hiding how many there are there (74:55 - 74:58)
are eight sages right (74:56 - 75:01)
yeah i think there are because in the (74:58 - 75:02)
final (75:01 - 75:04)
seven no because when you get to the (75:02 - 75:07)
elite four the eight gym leaders come (75:04 - 75:08)
and they're like we'll fight the sages (75:07 - 75:11)
you gotta remember and then they all (75:08 - 75:14)
line up to battle but you you you find (75:11 - 75:16)
them in just like random places (75:14 - 75:18)
like they're like this sage is in the (75:16 - 75:20)
cave the sages at the forest oh after (75:18 - 75:22)
after the main story yes but they they (75:20 - 75:25)
are like as part of the the story story (75:22 - 75:27)
right you come across them (75:25 - 75:29)
and you have to battle them there are (75:27 - 75:32)
seven sages in black and white two dang (75:29 - 75:34)
all right (75:32 - 75:35)
that's what i thought because it's seven (75:34 - 75:38)
stages and gets this yeah i don't think (75:35 - 75:41)
i don't think silent chilean and (75:38 - 75:42)
crescent and i don't think that do they (75:41 - 75:44)
show you the did they even show up (75:42 - 75:46)
silent chili and crescent (75:44 - 75:48)
they can't show up because they're the (75:46 - 75:49)
shadows (75:48 - 75:52)
which also right they are they don't but (75:49 - 75:54)
that's true though they don't show up to (75:52 - 75:55)
that final battle correct right because (75:54 - 75:58)
they're the shadow triad (75:55 - 76:00)
and they're they're helping gets this (75:58 - 76:01)
they're on his side but yeah right right (76:00 - 76:03)
that's what they should be that's like (76:01 - 76:06)
here's another component of the bad guys (76:03 - 76:09)
that's not a sage right so the bad guy (76:06 - 76:11)
team anything anything you could have (76:09 - 76:13)
pitbull you could have the mad scientist (76:11 - 76:14)
you could have the two (76:13 - 76:16)
oh okay i mean i mean like like cyrus (76:14 - 76:18)
has four people right he has (76:16 - 76:22)
jupiter mars saturn and (76:18 - 76:24)
oh maybe he has three he has one more i (76:22 - 76:26)
can't remember what planet it is pluto i (76:24 - 76:28)
don't know no and then there's not a (76:26 - 76:31)
planet lysan no pluto's planet again (76:28 - 76:33)
lysander has (76:31 - 76:35)
five or four (76:33 - 76:36)
and like literally no one remembers the (76:35 - 76:38)
lysander ones they just remember they (76:36 - 76:40)
have like different colored goggles and (76:38 - 76:41)
they show up (76:40 - 76:44)
and they have the worst (76:41 - 76:46)
zero fleshed out storyline about any of (76:44 - 76:47)
them (76:46 - 76:49)
um and they they just exist (76:47 - 76:51)
and you battle them in the factory and (76:49 - 76:53)
like none of them are memorable the mo (76:51 - 76:55)
the more memorable lysander people are (76:53 - 76:57)
like the like third in command pitbull (76:55 - 76:58)
people that you have to battle because (76:57 - 77:00)
they're like all white suits (76:58 - 77:03)
mr worldwide down there they all look (77:00 - 77:04)
great and i want to be part of that team (77:03 - 77:07)
is all i'm saying (77:04 - 77:07)
but yeah like (77:10 - 77:14)
there is there is the structure stuff of (77:12 - 77:16)
ruby and sapphire where they have mars (77:14 - 77:19)
jupiter saturn (77:16 - 77:19)
mars jupiter saturn yep that's it three (77:20 - 77:25)
yeah three and well there's chiron but (77:23 - 77:28)
they don't that's just a scientist right (77:25 - 77:29)
yeah (77:28 - 77:31)
yeah it's just mars jupiter and saturn (77:29 - 77:33)
oh okay there was a fourth one (77:31 - 77:36)
um (77:33 - 77:36)
okay (77:38 - 77:41)
i feel like i have more to say but we (77:40 - 77:44)
should take a break (77:41 - 77:44)
we take a break because we also have to (77:44 - 77:49)
talk about the car (77:46 - 77:50)
and we have to talk about this let's go (77:49 - 77:53)
feature are you going to talk about the (77:50 - 77:56)
blicephalon orbs on the car yeah we can (77:53 - 77:57)
talk about that i don't think that means (77:56 - 77:59)
anything about gita (77:57 - 78:01)
yeah what about gita yeah we gotta talk (77:59 - 78:03)
about her too (78:01 - 78:05)
get his hair weirds me out yeah they (78:03 - 78:07)
somebody finally played a final fantasy (78:05 - 78:09)
game over there (78:07 - 78:11)
uh all right we'll take uh we'll take a (78:09 - 78:14)
quick break we'll be right back (78:11 - 78:17)
and we are back (78:14 - 78:19)
so the car is a pokemon (78:17 - 78:23)
why why do you say that why look in one (78:19 - 78:25)
in one drawing (78:23 - 78:28)
one uh-huh it has an eyeball and a (78:25 - 78:31)
tongue sticking out at the top that's it (78:28 - 78:34)
yeah but my car has that too yeah (78:31 - 78:37)
there there is some featured key art (78:34 - 78:41)
which does show (78:37 - 78:41)
and we do not know if that is artistic (78:45 - 78:50)
interpretation of the scene artistic (78:47 - 78:53)
liberty or reality we have one (78:50 - 78:55)
one thing and it's got blue cephalon (78:53 - 78:57)
orbs at the top (78:55 - 78:59)
have you never seen like street art hot (78:57 - 79:02)
rods (78:59 - 79:02)
the engine okay so the pokemon is the (79:03 - 79:07)
the engine (79:05 - 79:08)
it's moving (79:07 - 79:10)
like if you go back and watch the (79:08 - 79:11)
trailer when there's like a short shot (79:10 - 79:14)
of it going up the car and the engine is (79:11 - 79:16)
moving like his tongue is moving around (79:14 - 79:18)
his eye is moving (79:16 - 79:18)
yeah it's called audio animatronics i (79:18 - 79:23)
can see that at disney they're not alive (79:21 - 79:25)
or a pokemon i don't i don't think the (79:23 - 79:29)
blue cephalon orbs mean anything i think (79:25 - 79:31)
or they're disco balls yeah they're just (79:29 - 79:33)
the same thing but it's fun to pretend (79:31 - 79:35)
because it's fire and blissetholon was (79:33 - 79:39)
fire fargo fire ghost by our ghost (79:35 - 79:41)
we forgot that earlier (79:39 - 79:42)
everyone always forgets about (79:41 - 79:44)
blacephalon well because it's a weird (79:42 - 79:46)
creepy clown (79:44 - 79:48)
without an exploding head like none of (79:46 - 79:52)
that is good none of that is good (79:48 - 79:52)
i mean she okay so here's the thing so (79:53 - 79:57)
we didn't talk about this with the titan (79:56 - 79:58)
stuff (79:57 - 80:00)
in this screenshot (79:58 - 80:03)
uh when you're battling team star also (80:00 - 80:04)
for the record i think team star's (80:03 - 80:06)
pretty good name (80:04 - 80:07)
uh (80:06 - 80:09)
i i think i think that's pretty fun i (80:07 - 80:11)
think that's so far more interesting (80:09 - 80:13)
than team yell tmel is just like angry (80:11 - 80:16)
soccer fans yeah well i mean it fit (80:13 - 80:19)
that's all the uk is a bunch of angry (80:16 - 80:22)
soccer fans so (80:19 - 80:22)
uh you know team skull is like based on (80:23 - 80:26)
like korean (80:24 - 80:28)
b-boys and they did a really bad job at (80:26 - 80:30)
like communicating that to people why (80:28 - 80:32)
did it have to be korean b boys they're (80:30 - 80:34)
just b boys yeah yeah but like that was (80:32 - 80:36)
like that's like (80:34 - 80:38)
they have them in japan as well (80:36 - 80:39)
yeah but i feel like it's bigger in (80:38 - 80:41)
korea mm-hmm (80:39 - 80:42)
no (80:41 - 80:45)
i i i think it's bigger in korea (80:42 - 80:47)
based off of what based off of what what (80:45 - 80:49)
show me your show me your work bring out (80:47 - 80:51)
the paper how many episodes of bleach (80:49 - 80:53)
have you watched yeah wait is bleach (80:51 - 80:54)
korean (80:53 - 80:57)
no (80:54 - 80:57)
i thought you're gonna say how many k (80:58 - 81:01)
dramas have you watched and i was like i (80:59 - 81:03)
don't know but my i could talk to my (81:01 - 81:05)
wife she's sick (81:03 - 81:05)
uh okay so in the screenshot we see a (81:06 - 81:12)
fue coco at level 15 battling um the (81:08 - 81:15)
torquel on top of the car (81:12 - 81:18)
at level 27 (81:15 - 81:21)
and it shows that that she has two (81:18 - 81:22)
pokemon (81:21 - 81:24)
um and it shows the player character (81:22 - 81:26)
having six pokemon (81:24 - 81:27)
um (81:26 - 81:30)
but still a fue coco so number one we (81:27 - 81:31)
know that fue coco probably doesn't (81:30 - 81:33)
evolve until 16 or higher oh we don't (81:31 - 81:35)
know because she we don't know if you've (81:33 - 81:36)
been hitting b button the entire time (81:35 - 81:37)
that's true i could have been at level (81:36 - 81:40)
10 and be like nah never thought (81:37 - 81:42)
i've never seen the third evolution so (81:40 - 81:42)
no (81:42 - 81:44)
never evolve (81:42 - 81:46)
is is this the is this gonna be legends (81:44 - 81:47)
though where you don't hit the b button (81:46 - 81:50)
you gotta go in and and tell it oh (81:47 - 81:51)
please (81:50 - 81:52)
oh please (81:51 - 81:55)
be that please please (81:52 - 81:58)
but 15 to 27 (81:55 - 82:01)
that that's a rigged that's a big level (81:58 - 82:02)
jump (82:01 - 82:04)
the thing they didn't show though (82:02 - 82:06)
is they showed levels here in this (82:04 - 82:09)
screenshot i just said level 15 male 4 (82:06 - 82:12)
coco 48 hp (82:09 - 82:14)
level 27 female torquel (82:12 - 82:16)
no hp you never see the opponent's hp (82:14 - 82:18)
anyways (82:16 - 82:20)
they didn't show during the battle with (82:18 - 82:24)
pseudo-widow and (82:20 - 82:24)
small of (82:24 - 82:28)
they they purposely did not show levels (82:26 - 82:29)
they should they show the health bar (82:28 - 82:31)
they said the name they they they (82:29 - 82:34)
purposely blacked that out (82:31 - 82:35)
so (82:34 - 82:36)
did they black it out because level (82:35 - 82:39)
scaling is a thing (82:36 - 82:41)
and (82:39 - 82:43)
depending on which gym you battle in (82:41 - 82:45)
which order (82:43 - 82:47)
that scales appropriately (82:45 - 82:50)
but then that begs the question is level (82:47 - 82:51)
scaling (82:50 - 82:54)
not a thing here because there is a 12 (82:51 - 82:57)
level difference (82:54 - 82:57)
but they they were okay with showing (82:57 - 83:02)
levels here and then i want to add on (83:00 - 83:05)
that again sorry that when you battle (83:02 - 83:08)
the titan cloth they also don't show (83:05 - 83:10)
that level (83:08 - 83:12)
they purposely (83:10 - 83:14)
hide that as well (83:12 - 83:17)
so does that have level scaling so what (83:14 - 83:18)
is happening (83:17 - 83:21)
in this (83:18 - 83:23)
to scrub the level data (83:21 - 83:25)
i agree (83:23 - 83:25)
you can't trust interns they're not (83:26 - 83:30)
getting paid so (83:28 - 83:30)
i don't know (83:31 - 83:36)
i i i i mentioned before i'm worried (83:33 - 83:38)
about what level scaling will be i'm (83:36 - 83:41)
worried about (83:38 - 83:44)
if if worldwide levels only raise (83:41 - 83:46)
because you've done gym badges and other (83:44 - 83:48)
things are going to be at set levels i i (83:46 - 83:51)
i don't know how they're going to handle (83:48 - 83:52)
this (83:51 - 83:55)
we only really have the wild area to go (83:52 - 83:57)
off of of how so far pokemon has handled (83:55 - 83:59)
it and it's been (83:57 - 84:01)
badge based (83:59 - 84:04)
so i i have to assume on some level it (84:01 - 84:06)
will remain badge based (84:04 - 84:08)
and (84:06 - 84:10)
you could technically (84:08 - 84:10)
go do this plotline but you may (84:11 - 84:14)
[Music] (84:13 - 84:16)
be under leveled because you didn't (84:14 - 84:19)
raise the overall level of the world and (84:16 - 84:21)
leveling is harder i i don't know what (84:19 - 84:23)
to really make from it other than past (84:21 - 84:25)
experience or they're all interrelated (84:23 - 84:27)
and if you (84:25 - 84:31)
level up on the team star storyline than (84:27 - 84:32)
the gyms (84:31 - 84:34)
level off yeah i mean they could do that (84:32 - 84:36)
too i i i want it to be that no matter (84:34 - 84:39)
what plot line you (84:36 - 84:42)
hit when you hit x benchmark the world (84:39 - 84:46)
raises as well yeah that's right (84:42 - 84:48)
i don't have faith that's how it is but (84:46 - 84:50)
i hope that's how it is (84:48 - 84:53)
yeah i mean in sword and shield if (84:50 - 84:54)
the pokemon in the wild area gets (84:53 - 84:56)
stronger when you get badges (84:54 - 84:58)
and if you're ignoring the whole (84:56 - 85:00)
champion thing (84:58 - 85:02)
does that mean the pokemon in the wild (85:00 - 85:05)
area stay level 10 (85:02 - 85:06)
i i (85:05 - 85:08)
don't i don't know i don't know i i this (85:06 - 85:10)
is the whole problem with like quote (85:08 - 85:14)
unquote and open world pokemon game is (85:10 - 85:14)
how how (85:15 - 85:20)
yeah how do they balance this (85:17 - 85:21)
um (85:20 - 85:24)
because that's that's not like thing in (85:21 - 85:27)
that's not a thing in like zelda zelda (85:24 - 85:30)
you just have hearts (85:27 - 85:30)
and (85:30 - 85:33)
if you get hit that takes up certain (85:30 - 85:35)
hearts and like some enemies who hit you (85:33 - 85:37)
take one heart and some enemies that hit (85:35 - 85:39)
you take five (85:37 - 85:42)
hearts but isn't it kind of like lead uh (85:39 - 85:45)
area based like legends arceus where (85:42 - 85:46)
like (85:45 - 85:49)
as you go to different areas then the (85:46 - 85:52)
pokemon become higher level (85:49 - 85:52)
yes i mean so i'm thinking like zelda (85:54 - 85:58)
right there's some areas in the zelda (85:56 - 85:59)
game where it's like don't go there (85:58 - 86:01)
you're under level don't walk through (85:59 - 86:01)
there (86:01 - 86:03)
you could though (86:01 - 86:04)
you could well i mean you could probably (86:03 - 86:07)
come for this one too right but that's (86:04 - 86:10)
also how mmos are right like this level (86:07 - 86:12)
has higher mobs this area has higher (86:10 - 86:14)
mobs than (86:12 - 86:14)
this (86:14 - 86:17)
other area maybe the gyms are all (86:14 - 86:19)
situated and you know what area you're (86:17 - 86:21)
walking into and it's like well this is (86:19 - 86:23)
the level 60 area so the gym in this (86:21 - 86:25)
area is going to have level 60 pokemon i (86:23 - 86:29)
can do it with my level 2 pokemon i can (86:25 - 86:31)
walk through the door but (86:29 - 86:31)
yeah (86:31 - 86:33)
yeah i feel like that's the worst way to (86:31 - 86:36)
do open world (86:33 - 86:40)
i mean like the the other thing too is (86:36 - 86:40)
so there there are these weird you can (86:41 - 86:45)
look at the map right the map the map of (86:43 - 86:47)
the paldeya region exists there's a very (86:45 - 86:49)
high quality one that you can crazy zoom (86:47 - 86:51)
in on i don't know where that high (86:49 - 86:52)
quality one came from but you can you (86:51 - 86:54)
can find on google you can zoom into it (86:52 - 86:55)
really well you can see all the detail (86:54 - 86:57)
on the map (86:55 - 86:59)
we know that there are towers that exist (86:57 - 87:02)
we know where all eight gyms are if you (86:59 - 87:04)
zoom into that map you can see the (87:02 - 87:07)
literally the like the the layout of a (87:04 - 87:09)
gym it looks like a football field you (87:07 - 87:11)
can you can go like here are the eight (87:09 - 87:13)
gyms across this map (87:11 - 87:15)
um here are the towers here are the open (87:13 - 87:17)
spaces here's the swamp here's the water (87:15 - 87:19)
here's the desert you can see all that (87:17 - 87:21)
stuff on the map (87:19 - 87:22)
there's a thing in open world games that (87:21 - 87:25)
we haven't talked about uh which is a (87:22 - 87:26)
lot of open world games rely on like a (87:25 - 87:29)
tower system zelda does this assassin (87:26 - 87:32)
creed does this infamous does this where (87:29 - 87:33)
you you (87:32 - 87:34)
can (87:33 - 87:36)
quote and quote quote unquote go (87:34 - 87:40)
anywhere but uh to make that easier or (87:36 - 87:42)
to make that better or to actually get (87:40 - 87:44)
there you need to climb this tower to (87:42 - 87:46)
unlock this area of the map so you can (87:44 - 87:48)
properly explore it um (87:46 - 87:49)
so (87:48 - 87:52)
is team star (87:49 - 87:53)
the (87:52 - 87:56)
beat the team star to open up this area (87:53 - 87:58)
of the game like we're saying you can go (87:56 - 87:59)
anywhere (87:58 - 88:01)
but you can't go past this because you (87:59 - 88:04)
need to defeat team star (88:01 - 88:05)
and once you defeat them you can open up (88:04 - 88:07)
the area behind them (88:05 - 88:08)
um (88:07 - 88:11)
or are they just existing to exist (88:08 - 88:13)
are as team star moving around the map (88:11 - 88:15)
is team star right here what happens (88:13 - 88:16)
when you defeat teamstar are they now (88:15 - 88:18)
gone and when they're gone are pokemon (88:16 - 88:21)
replacing like there's so many (88:18 - 88:23)
unanswered questions (88:21 - 88:24)
of (88:23 - 88:27)
how this open world actually works how (88:24 - 88:30)
this story actually works how co-op (88:27 - 88:32)
actually works and it's really easy to (88:30 - 88:34)
be excited and be like (88:32 - 88:36)
this is going to be the best pokemon (88:34 - 88:38)
game in the world and i hope it is i (88:36 - 88:40)
hope it is i hope it is but there's (88:38 - 88:42)
there's also so many things that can go (88:40 - 88:46)
wrong that a traditional (88:42 - 88:46)
formula (88:46 - 88:49)
has been like i'm gonna go through this (88:47 - 88:51)
game i'm gonna get my eight gym badges (88:49 - 88:53)
i'm gonna follow this pretty much linear (88:51 - 88:54)
path (88:53 - 88:56)
um there's gonna be bad guy stories at (88:54 - 88:57)
some point i'm gonna catch a legendary (88:56 - 88:59)
and then after that i can go anywhere i (88:57 - 89:02)
want everything is level 60 or higher (88:59 - 89:04)
everything is (89:02 - 89:06)
like a pokemon game does become go (89:04 - 89:08)
anywhere you want once you beat (89:06 - 89:11)
the story but yeah they're also curating (89:08 - 89:14)
you an experience through that (89:11 - 89:14)
when you're when you want your player to (89:15 - 89:19)
curate their own experience that can go (89:17 - 89:22)
either really poorly or really good (89:19 - 89:23)
depending on the player but you you (89:22 - 89:27)
still kind of have to (89:23 - 89:27)
you kind of have to get that right so it (89:29 - 89:32)
feels right (89:31 - 89:35)
like like elden ring (89:32 - 89:36)
doesn't give you any (89:35 - 89:39)
there here's a sword go anywhere you (89:36 - 89:40)
want (89:39 - 89:42)
and the the thing about like elden ring (89:40 - 89:45)
is if you go north it's kind of hard and (89:42 - 89:47)
they don't tell you that if you go south (89:45 - 89:48)
that's actually where you should have (89:47 - 89:50)
went because that's that's that's where (89:48 - 89:52)
the the intro level is but nowhere does (89:50 - 89:54)
the game say like hey (89:52 - 89:56)
north is hard south is easy like i went (89:54 - 89:58)
to the spoiler (89:56 - 90:00)
i went north and i did all that stuff (89:58 - 90:01)
and then (90:00 - 90:03)
when i eventually went south i was like (90:01 - 90:05)
this is all way like this is all way too (90:03 - 90:07)
easy like (90:05 - 90:10)
it's here i wish i did it first because (90:07 - 90:13)
like now it doesn't feel fun because i'm (90:10 - 90:14)
so over leveled (90:13 - 90:16)
and i've learned so many skills at this (90:14 - 90:18)
point that like this whole area down (90:16 - 90:20)
here feels useless (90:18 - 90:22)
and that's that's a game that has like (90:20 - 90:24)
this this area is hard this area is (90:22 - 90:26)
harder this area is easy this area is (90:24 - 90:29)
easier so if you do all the hard stuff (90:26 - 90:30)
first (90:29 - 90:32)
you've kind of (90:30 - 90:34)
almost spoiled yourself for the the (90:32 - 90:36)
other areas that you should have done (90:34 - 90:37)
beforehand (90:36 - 90:39)
so is the pokemon game going to be like (90:37 - 90:41)
that because like that seems like an (90:39 - 90:43)
easy complaint to be like well i did the (90:41 - 90:45)
three gyms that were really hard now all (90:43 - 90:48)
the other gyms i just one shot (90:45 - 90:48)
there's a lot of things to be concerned (90:50 - 90:54)
about about the first open world game (90:52 - 90:56)
and again i will always say this (90:54 - 90:59)
be excited but temper your expectations (90:56 - 91:01)
because you don't (90:59 - 91:03)
know (91:01 - 91:04)
yet (91:03 - 91:07)
like we don't have an example uh we (91:04 - 91:10)
don't have a great example of how (91:07 - 91:14)
the pokemon company views open world (91:10 - 91:16)
we have how other companies view open (91:14 - 91:19)
world and we can make some parallels but (91:16 - 91:22)
we don't know what they decided to do (91:19 - 91:24)
and i think legends is a bad example (91:22 - 91:26)
because there are seven battles in that (91:24 - 91:28)
entire game (91:26 - 91:29)
legend six of those seven battles are (91:28 - 91:31)
against like a togepi (91:29 - 91:34)
i mean legends is also locked regions (91:31 - 91:36)
you it's not open world you have to (91:34 - 91:38)
proceed through the regions as they (91:36 - 91:40)
unlock for you it is a linear (91:38 - 91:42)
progressive while you're in that region (91:40 - 91:45)
you can go anywhere but you can't go to (91:42 - 91:47)
that region until the game unlocks it (91:45 - 91:49)
for you (91:47 - 91:49)
yeah i mean like (91:51 - 91:55)
i never had a problem with the linear (91:53 - 91:57)
aspect of pokemon because like i'm going (91:55 - 91:58)
to experience that story it's going to (91:57 - 92:00)
be good and then i'm going to do all the (91:58 - 92:01)
pokemon things i do once the story is (92:00 - 92:02)
done (92:01 - 92:03)
like i'm going to finish the pokedex i'm (92:02 - 92:04)
going to (92:03 - 92:05)
build a competitive team i'm going to (92:04 - 92:07)
shiny hunt i don't want to do that (92:05 - 92:09)
anyway until the story is done (92:07 - 92:11)
because (92:09 - 92:12)
why would i just not do the story the (92:11 - 92:14)
only downside the only (92:12 - 92:16)
i'm just punishing myself by not doing (92:14 - 92:17)
the story first because people are gonna (92:16 - 92:18)
be like hey did you get to this part of (92:17 - 92:20)
the story or did you like it's just you (92:18 - 92:22)
just do that first get out of the way (92:20 - 92:23)
enjoy it (92:22 - 92:25)
and then do everything else (92:23 - 92:27)
yeah (92:25 - 92:27)
i want the three plot lines to be more (92:29 - 92:34)
than marketing i want them to be fleshed (92:32 - 92:34)
out (92:34 - 92:37)
i am concerned about (92:34 - 92:39)
how following one of the storylines (92:37 - 92:42)
affects levels in the open world like (92:39 - 92:45)
there are a lot of things that i am (92:42 - 92:47)
leery about from what we've seen and (92:45 - 92:50)
what we've not seen (92:47 - 92:50)
yeah i hate to do i hate to do like all (92:52 - 92:57)
eight gyms and then have the (92:54 - 92:57)
star (92:57 - 93:00)
team storyline have been locked at level (92:57 - 93:02)
10 the entire time and then i just blow (93:00 - 93:04)
through it and it's nothing (93:02 - 93:06)
right (93:04 - 93:10)
so like i'm worried about those things (93:06 - 93:10)
i'm not worried i'll just take what i (93:11 - 93:16)
get i mean i i mean (93:13 - 93:18)
worried is is an over extension of my (93:16 - 93:21)
actual feelings for dramatic effect but (93:18 - 93:26)
yeah i i am thinking about it let's say (93:21 - 93:26)
um we have gita gita is the chairwoman (93:26 - 93:31)
of the pokemon league uh which operates (93:29 - 93:33)
paldayas pokemon gyms (93:31 - 93:37)
among region's champions she supre she (93:33 - 93:39)
reigns as supreme as the most skilled (93:37 - 93:40)
trainer of all (93:39 - 93:45)
so they're saying here she is champion (93:40 - 93:45)
but there are multiple champions (93:45 - 93:51)
uh which is kind of what they're doing (93:48 - 93:52)
in the anime (93:51 - 93:54)
yeah like (93:52 - 93:55)
they're like there are multiple (93:54 - 93:57)
champions because you've reached a (93:55 - 93:59)
certain class (93:57 - 94:01)
uh (93:59 - 94:01)
so are they is this their sort of way of (94:01 - 94:05)
saying (94:04 - 94:07)
the other champions are the (94:05 - 94:09)
quote-unquote elite four and (94:07 - 94:12)
she's the one at the end (94:09 - 94:12)
i kind of have that vibe (94:12 - 94:16)
yeah (94:14 - 94:18)
or even the gym leaders are considered (94:16 - 94:20)
champions yeah i i i'm curious what they (94:18 - 94:22)
say the region's champions because it (94:20 - 94:24)
could be gym leaders i i do feel like (94:22 - 94:26)
they are just saying (94:24 - 94:28)
there's again there's an elite four (94:26 - 94:30)
there are four quote unquote regional (94:28 - 94:33)
champions and then (94:30 - 94:35)
she's the champion and has a day job (94:33 - 94:38)
like she's finally doing it all (94:35 - 94:38)
yeah i mean like i hate her hair (94:40 - 94:46)
don't hate on that beautiful hair it's (94:43 - 94:48)
cool (94:46 - 94:48)
so i don't think anyone's talking about (94:49 - 94:55)
this this is the first um (94:51 - 94:55)
what is the correct word sorry spanish (94:55 - 95:02)
champion latino champion wait a minute (94:57 - 95:05)
she's south asian dude gita is a south (95:02 - 95:07)
asian south asian you got it (95:05 - 95:10)
guys she's not she's not from spain (95:07 - 95:12)
is that (95:10 - 95:12)
yeah that's south asian so skeeta comes (95:13 - 95:18)
from sanskrit it means beloved (95:15 - 95:20)
south asia (95:18 - 95:21)
yeah (95:20 - 95:24)
south is okay south asia means like (95:21 - 95:26)
india pakistan (95:24 - 95:27)
yeah (95:26 - 95:28)
because yeah i saw somebody mention her (95:27 - 95:31)
name is a specific (95:28 - 95:32)
uh comes from a specific area i couldn't (95:31 - 95:35)
remember but that comes from sanskrit (95:32 - 95:37)
which is the sort of (95:35 - 95:40)
one one of the key languages of that (95:37 - 95:42)
area i mean (95:40 - 95:43)
they have been (95:42 - 95:46)
diversifying their champion roster (95:43 - 95:47)
thankfully (95:46 - 95:50)
uh i think this is (95:47 - 95:52)
great (95:50 - 95:53)
um (95:52 - 95:58)
i think it's also great that they are (95:53 - 96:00)
because you know i when i complained (95:58 - 96:02)
about diversity before (96:00 - 96:04)
in games they're like what this is japan (96:02 - 96:07)
and i'm like hey it's not actual japan b (96:04 - 96:09)
japan is still diverse (96:07 - 96:11)
and see (96:09 - 96:14)
it's not a real location it can be (96:11 - 96:16)
anything you want so the fact that they (96:14 - 96:17)
are (96:16 - 96:19)
more than willing to put diversity in (96:17 - 96:21)
even the people could be like well it's (96:19 - 96:24)
spain it's not spain it is based off of (96:21 - 96:26)
spain and (96:24 - 96:29)
getting more diversity from a larger (96:26 - 96:31)
section of the world particularly from (96:29 - 96:33)
communities that are (96:31 - 96:36)
vastly underrepresented in in western (96:33 - 96:41)
media is a is a great thing to see (96:36 - 96:43)
yeah totally (96:41 - 96:45)
it's just yeah so going back to the (96:43 - 96:47)
question of among regions champions she (96:45 - 96:49)
is the supreme and most skilled they (96:47 - 96:51)
also say she's in charge of the pokemon (96:49 - 96:53)
league yeah so i think you guys are (96:51 - 96:54)
correct as in (96:53 - 96:56)
the other elite four members are (96:54 - 96:59)
considered champion class yep um which (96:56 - 97:00)
if you're watching the anime you have (96:59 - 97:02)
like the (97:00 - 97:04)
or if you've just played competitive in (97:02 - 97:06)
in any of the recent pokemon games you (97:04 - 97:08)
have like pokeball class great class uh (97:06 - 97:12)
ultra class master class um (97:08 - 97:14)
and (97:12 - 97:16)
i i think (97:14 - 97:18)
that is a (97:16 - 97:19)
good (97:18 - 97:22)
direction to go with because it's kind (97:19 - 97:24)
of something that's always existed in (97:22 - 97:26)
the anime you always see these really (97:24 - 97:28)
powerful trainers they're known by (97:26 - 97:31)
everyone else to be powerful trainers (97:28 - 97:32)
like (97:31 - 97:35)
it's kind of silly to it's kind of silly (97:32 - 97:37)
looking back on alola (97:35 - 97:38)
and (97:37 - 97:40)
uh professor kakui is like i couldn't do (97:38 - 97:42)
the kanto pokemon league and we don't (97:40 - 97:44)
have a pokemon league so i'm gonna build (97:42 - 97:46)
the pokemon league so we can determine (97:44 - 97:49)
the best powerful trainer (97:46 - 97:51)
and it's and then going the extent of (97:49 - 97:54)
like i'm just going to then take people (97:51 - 97:57)
in charge of trials and make them (97:54 - 97:58)
already (97:57 - 98:00)
elite four members because though (97:58 - 98:02)
they're they're already known as the (98:00 - 98:03)
strongest people it's like yeah that's (98:02 - 98:05)
that's fine but he brought in that one (98:03 - 98:06)
golf (98:05 - 98:08)
person yeah like yeah and he and he said (98:06 - 98:10)
that like kahili was known as the (98:08 - 98:12)
strongest trainer before she left and (98:10 - 98:14)
but that's how it should be right like (98:12 - 98:15)
these are just (98:14 - 98:18)
powerful trainers like the the (98:15 - 98:21)
having one champion in such a (98:18 - 98:24)
huge world of pokemon is kind of silly (98:21 - 98:26)
at this point yeah (98:24 - 98:29)
um (98:26 - 98:29)
and and the anime has always done a (98:30 - 98:33)
really good job at being like this world (98:32 - 98:35)
is big and there's a lot of really good (98:33 - 98:36)
trainers and that's and that's why (98:35 - 98:37)
that's why it kind of makes me mad when (98:36 - 98:40)
people are like well ash sucks it's like (98:37 - 98:41)
well how many times have you gone to a (98:40 - 98:42)
tournament and come in second place how (98:41 - 98:44)
many times have you come in fourth place (98:42 - 98:45)
like (98:44 - 98:48)
ash is actually really good at battling (98:45 - 98:50)
yes he's made dumb mistakes but like (98:48 - 98:52)
yeah so does everyone else (98:50 - 98:54)
i mean i (98:52 - 98:55)
yeah it's still my biggest complaint of (98:54 - 98:57)
the journeys as they make the world feel (98:55 - 99:00)
so small i i don't like how they jump (98:57 - 99:01)
like (99:00 - 99:02)
like (99:01 - 99:05)
let's go to galler and it's like (99:02 - 99:07)
is it like next door because you just (99:05 - 99:09)
hop around a lot oh please they do that (99:07 - 99:12)
on agents of shield (99:09 - 99:15)
shield has a giant supersonic airship (99:12 - 99:18)
it's not that supersonic i don't mind (99:15 - 99:19)
the jumping because (99:18 - 99:21)
because the the alternative is what (99:19 - 99:24)
we've had for so many years (99:21 - 99:25)
i don't want to spend three episodes (99:24 - 99:27)
getting to a destination i just don't it (99:25 - 99:29)
is i mean with some of the filler (99:27 - 99:31)
episodes i'd rather have them spend (99:29 - 99:33)
three days getting to a destination i (99:31 - 99:35)
would rather see ash and go lose their (99:33 - 99:37)
luggage in the airport than some of the (99:35 - 99:41)
things i've just watched (99:37 - 99:41)
um (99:42 - 99:46)
gita seems cool uh yeah they have not (99:43 - 99:50)
they have not uh shown her hand in in (99:46 - 99:53)
what pokemon she may or may not be using (99:50 - 99:55)
um (99:53 - 99:58)
i mean i'm looking at her outfit for (99:55 - 100:01)
any hint and (99:58 - 100:01)
all i have is the eyeball on her glove (100:02 - 100:08)
i i mean like i guess like if i was to (100:06 - 100:11)
pick a compass (100:08 - 100:11)
that's not an eyeball is it eyeball it's (100:11 - 100:16)
a compass well it's the illuminati she's (100:14 - 100:18)
gonna have twerkle because that's an (100:16 - 100:20)
india exclusive (100:18 - 100:24)
no the mela already has thorkl (100:20 - 100:24)
they can't have any overlaps in trainers (100:25 - 100:31)
no that's never allowed uh you know (100:29 - 100:32)
she'll probably have like a (100:31 - 100:35)
[Laughter] (100:32 - 100:37)
charizard i think i i you know i still (100:35 - 100:39)
think leon was a good champion (100:37 - 100:41)
i thought the whole like (100:39 - 100:43)
presenting leon up front (100:41 - 100:46)
leon like (100:43 - 100:48)
like hops journey to try to be like his (100:46 - 100:50)
brother and to follow the footsteps of (100:48 - 100:51)
his brother that storyline still annoys (100:50 - 100:53)
me though because like hop goes from (100:51 - 100:55)
like changing his team because he keeps (100:53 - 100:58)
losing which which also infuriates it's (100:55 - 101:00)
if infuriates me when people are like (100:58 - 101:04)
hop is a bad rival like you crush every (101:00 - 101:07)
rival through every pokemon game and do (101:04 - 101:09)
you know why you crush them because they (101:07 - 101:14)
continue using the same pokemon like (101:09 - 101:15)
we know that it's like at this point (101:14 - 101:18)
blue has a pidgeot (101:15 - 101:20)
you know what he's he caught a pidgey on (101:18 - 101:22)
route one and he kept the pidgey (101:20 - 101:23)
throughout the entire game because (101:22 - 101:26)
they're friends (101:23 - 101:29)
like like hop you you crush him and then (101:26 - 101:31)
bead crushes him and you know what he (101:29 - 101:33)
changes his entire team (101:31 - 101:36)
to try to not lose again (101:33 - 101:37)
that's pretty that's a pretty good (101:36 - 101:40)
characteristic in arrival to be like you (101:37 - 101:42)
know what i keep losing to this guy i (101:40 - 101:44)
should maybe change my team (101:42 - 101:46)
but the problem wasn't his pokemon the (101:44 - 101:48)
problem was him (101:46 - 101:49)
yeah the problem wasn't (101:48 - 101:52)
that that is true um (101:49 - 101:54)
so it does drive me crazy one that (101:52 - 101:55)
people don't like (101:54 - 101:58)
people complain that hop wants to like (101:55 - 102:00)
battle you too much and it's like yeah (101:58 - 102:02)
because he wants he wants to be champion (102:00 - 102:05)
like of course he wants to battle um and (102:02 - 102:07)
then it bothers me that bothers me (102:05 - 102:08)
personally at the end he's like i just (102:07 - 102:10)
want to be a pokemon professor (102:08 - 102:12)
what why (102:10 - 102:13)
why why bother you (102:12 - 102:14)
because like (102:13 - 102:18)
he wants to be his brother yeah i wanted (102:14 - 102:20)
to be a veterinarian and then i went oh (102:18 - 102:22)
i actually have to watch animals die (102:20 - 102:25)
maybe i'll be an actor instead all the (102:22 - 102:29)
time too like i think it is a huge thing (102:25 - 102:31)
that after being beaten down a whole lot (102:29 - 102:34)
and searching and thinking (102:31 - 102:37)
okay hey that's my brother's dream not (102:34 - 102:39)
mine that's true and b (102:37 - 102:42)
i'm actually really good at this other (102:39 - 102:43)
thing (102:42 - 102:46)
i'm gonna do this other thing they don't (102:43 - 102:47)
they don't explicitly give him that (102:46 - 102:50)
dialogue of being like (102:47 - 102:52)
i'm following my brother because that's (102:50 - 102:54)
what i thought i'd need to do (102:52 - 102:58)
it's implied because you're a kid (102:54 - 103:02)
every sibling acts like that (102:58 - 103:02)
100 (103:02 - 103:05)
i'm sure at some point there was a tie (103:06 - 103:10)
when your brother wanted to be exactly (103:08 - 103:12)
like you and then at some point (103:10 - 103:14)
he was like nope (103:12 - 103:15)
ah (103:14 - 103:18)
i don't think so but i mean i'm i'm i'm (103:15 - 103:21)
i agree that that exists (103:18 - 103:21)
i always say like (103:22 - 103:26)
there's bands that i don't like to this (103:23 - 103:28)
day because they were huge (103:26 - 103:30)
bands that my brother liked (103:28 - 103:32)
and once i got to a certain age where (103:30 - 103:35)
i'm like i want to like nothing that he (103:32 - 103:39)
likes i still don't like those bands (103:35 - 103:39)
uh (103:41 - 103:44)
okay i think this is the last thing (103:42 - 103:46)
saved at the last they didn't show this (103:44 - 103:47)
in the trailer they showed this in the (103:46 - 103:50)
trailer but showed it kind of but like (103:47 - 103:52)
didn't say anything about it uh this is (103:50 - 103:55)
off just the pokemon website let's go a (103:52 - 103:57)
handy feature for exploring the paldaya (103:55 - 104:00)
region tell your pokemon to go adventure (103:57 - 104:01)
you can have one pokemon out walking (104:00 - 104:04)
with you in the paledeos region great (104:01 - 104:05)
outdoors when you have a pokemon (104:04 - 104:06)
exploring with you in the field you can (104:05 - 104:08)
use the let's go feature to send that (104:06 - 104:10)
pokemon in a direction you indicate what (104:08 - 104:12)
the pokemon you send out is (104:10 - 104:13)
independently will pick up items in the (104:12 - 104:15)
area and even has an auto battle for (104:13 - 104:17)
nearby pokemon (104:15 - 104:19)
what are auto battles auto battles are a (104:17 - 104:21)
new way of battling that can be (104:19 - 104:23)
activated by using the let's go feature (104:21 - 104:25)
doing so will send a pokemon to battle (104:23 - 104:27)
wild pokemon without needing orders from (104:25 - 104:28)
its trainers your pokemon can be sent (104:27 - 104:30)
into auto battle against any wild (104:28 - 104:32)
pokemon you see on the field and it can (104:30 - 104:35)
even (104:32 - 104:37)
find pokemon to engage in an auto battle (104:35 - 104:38)
on its own (104:37 - 104:40)
when your pokemon is out engaging in (104:38 - 104:43)
auto battles you can you can do (104:40 - 104:45)
what you want stay by its side watch (104:43 - 104:47)
over it or try to look by nearby items (104:45 - 104:49)
by defeating wild pokemon in auto (104:47 - 104:51)
battles your pokemon can also earn (104:49 - 104:52)
experience points (104:51 - 104:55)
uh master this new feature and explore (104:52 - 104:57)
every nook and cranny and (104:55 - 104:59)
of the vast paledeo region with your (104:57 - 105:02)
pokemon that's all it says (104:59 - 105:04)
um (105:02 - 105:05)
so this (105:04 - 105:09)
kind of has always existed (105:05 - 105:12)
uh pokepeligo (105:09 - 105:14)
is a way to (105:12 - 105:16)
put your pokemon in and get items (105:14 - 105:19)
there's like the cave feature pokemon go (105:16 - 105:20)
lets you hatch eggs (105:19 - 105:23)
i did feel like this is the (105:20 - 105:27)
updated version of the job system from (105:23 - 105:29)
jordan i was gonna say this is also a (105:27 - 105:32)
visual job system instead of hopefully (105:29 - 105:34)
more interactive than send them off and (105:32 - 105:35)
then they come back (105:34 - 105:37)
yeah so for those gosh it's been three (105:35 - 105:38)
years for sword and shield i don't think (105:37 - 105:40)
anyone talked about the job system after (105:38 - 105:41)
the first two weeks of that game because (105:40 - 105:45)
it was so bad it was bad the job system (105:41 - 105:47)
was bad (105:45 - 105:50)
like it did so (105:47 - 105:51)
let's explain the job system if you went (105:50 - 105:53)
to the the pc in any of the pokemon (105:51 - 105:54)
centers you could send your pokemon off (105:53 - 105:56)
on a job (105:54 - 105:58)
and there were jobs that did certain (105:56 - 105:58)
things (105:58 - 106:01)
so like some jobs would get you a bunch (105:58 - 106:03)
of experience some jobs would get you (106:01 - 106:05)
specific like evs like i'll send it on (106:03 - 106:06)
this this (106:05 - 106:08)
uh (106:06 - 106:09)
they were all based on like different (106:08 - 106:12)
company or sponsor names like i'll send (106:09 - 106:14)
this to the the tree area and then my (106:12 - 106:17)
pokemons um the 10 pokemon i spend will (106:14 - 106:18)
have (106:17 - 106:21)
like 100 points in special attack evs or (106:18 - 106:24)
whatever and they'll get experience (106:21 - 106:26)
uh it wasn't very clear it wasn't very (106:24 - 106:27)
helpful (106:26 - 106:29)
to like a casual pokemon person to like (106:27 - 106:31)
just be like i want to go here and send (106:29 - 106:32)
out pokemon (106:31 - 106:34)
um it also was like a disaster for your (106:32 - 106:37)
pc boxes because it would also dump the (106:34 - 106:38)
pokemon into the first box no matter (106:37 - 106:41)
what so even even if you put all the (106:38 - 106:43)
like these are 30 pokemon that i need to (106:41 - 106:45)
get up up to level 100 and they're in (106:43 - 106:46)
box seven (106:45 - 106:48)
and you send them all out they will just (106:46 - 106:50)
filter back into box one in whatever (106:48 - 106:52)
random order they want and i know why (106:50 - 106:53)
you didn't use box one you moved (106:52 - 106:56)
everybody to box two (106:53 - 106:56)
well yeah and then (106:58 - 107:01)
don't justify this bad system (106:59 - 107:03)
yeah i mean that's the box one has (107:01 - 107:05)
always been the mess box (107:03 - 107:07)
true i agree (107:05 - 107:08)
um (107:07 - 107:11)
so this isn't too different than that (107:08 - 107:14)
except it's a little bit more visual (107:11 - 107:16)
um (107:14 - 107:18)
like there's there's been ways to (107:16 - 107:20)
increase your pokemon levels before like (107:18 - 107:24)
i said the the job system pokepeligo um (107:20 - 107:25)
probably something before that that i (107:24 - 107:27)
can't think of the daycare was another (107:25 - 107:30)
way to increase your pokemon levels (107:27 - 107:33)
um and i think that's fine and i think (107:30 - 107:35)
what's funny is earlier in our (107:33 - 107:36)
conversation greg was like following (107:35 - 107:39)
pokemon just follow you there's it (107:36 - 107:40)
doesn't really add anything and they're (107:39 - 107:42)
like well now we're gonna add something (107:40 - 107:43)
which is (107:42 - 107:46)
great i think that's good (107:43 - 107:48)
i (107:46 - 107:48)
what does this look like though like how (107:48 - 107:52)
much experience are they getting is it (107:51 - 107:54)
going to be like the job system where it (107:52 - 107:55)
was like you try it once or twice you (107:54 - 107:57)
realize it's not worth it or it's it's (107:55 - 108:00)
too much to manage or (107:57 - 108:01)
um does you know your pokemon go off (108:00 - 108:03)
faint after one battle and you're like (108:01 - 108:05)
i'm wasting more revives to like bring (108:03 - 108:07)
them back (108:05 - 108:09)
i also seem to suggest like you send (108:07 - 108:10)
them off while you're off doing (108:09 - 108:12)
something else (108:10 - 108:13)
so like (108:12 - 108:16)
it gives me the sense of like is there (108:13 - 108:18)
some weird crafting system because i (108:16 - 108:20)
mean we know there's got to be a cooking (108:18 - 108:21)
system so you're like okay i'm going to (108:20 - 108:23)
be searching for (108:21 - 108:26)
berries and drop sausage packets over (108:23 - 108:29)
here you go often level because i just (108:26 - 108:31)
want to spend an hour (108:29 - 108:32)
finding (108:31 - 108:35)
unopened cans of spam yeah but i think (108:32 - 108:37)
you still have to stay (108:35 - 108:39)
relatively close even if you're not (108:37 - 108:41)
staring at them while they're doing (108:39 - 108:43)
their whole thing i i get the sense (108:41 - 108:45)
you're not going to be able to wander (108:43 - 108:48)
too far away yeah (108:45 - 108:50)
um (108:48 - 108:50)
you can do what you want stay by its (108:53 - 108:58)
side to watch over it or try looking for (108:56 - 109:00)
items nearby by defeating wild pokemon (108:58 - 109:01)
auto battles your pokemon can earn (109:00 - 109:04)
experience and items (109:01 - 109:06)
i don't know the the words do what you (109:04 - 109:08)
want (109:06 - 109:08)
there's a lot of interpretation there (109:09 - 109:13)
yeah (109:11 - 109:15)
um (109:13 - 109:18)
yeah i mean like (109:15 - 109:18)
th this is this is there to remove grind (109:19 - 109:25)
right like (109:23 - 109:26)
if if we (109:25 - 109:29)
if we ask why this feature is introduced (109:26 - 109:30)
why why (109:29 - 109:33)
why did pokepala go exist why did the (109:30 - 109:36)
job system exist why does this exist i (109:33 - 109:39)
think the answer is to remove grind the (109:36 - 109:41)
removing grind of collecting antidotes (109:39 - 109:43)
or whatever (109:41 - 109:45)
leaf stones or whatever (109:43 - 109:48)
and removing the grind of (109:45 - 109:50)
leveling pokemon (109:48 - 109:53)
and now to those that are like well (109:50 - 109:53)
i'll battle trainers or catch pokemon to (109:54 - 110:00)
level your pokemon sure (109:57 - 110:02)
but what if you want to level other (110:00 - 110:04)
pokemon that isn't directly in your (110:02 - 110:05)
party so you can switch out your team (110:04 - 110:08)
right like this is like yeah (110:05 - 110:09)
this is this is like always been an (110:08 - 110:11)
issue in pokemon games of like (110:09 - 110:14)
i'm i'm i'm at the seventh gym i found (110:11 - 110:15)
this brand new pokemon i would like to (110:14 - 110:17)
put them on my team but i do not want to (110:15 - 110:19)
level this like it is it is 20 levels (110:17 - 110:21)
below and i got two more gyms to do i am (110:19 - 110:23)
not going to spend time leveling this (110:21 - 110:25)
one single pokemon i am sure there are (110:23 - 110:28)
people out there that do that though i (110:25 - 110:30)
i am guilty i have i've not done that (110:28 - 110:33)
because i i think the same thing of like (110:30 - 110:35)
cool i found a larvesta for the first (110:33 - 110:36)
time (110:35 - 110:40)
after the seventh gym it needs 25 levels (110:36 - 110:41)
to evolve (110:40 - 110:46)
i'm good like what if it's auto battle (110:41 - 110:49)
and you suddenly see it's just shiny (110:46 - 110:50)
okay this is (110:49 - 110:53)
this is a thing that i've seen too like (110:50 - 110:54)
like (110:53 - 110:56)
plus i just don't care kill them all (110:54 - 110:59)
okay so it's it's literally saying (110:56 - 111:01)
you can look at the pokemon it's (110:59 - 111:02)
battling (111:01 - 111:04)
so you would see if it was shiny or not (111:02 - 111:06)
before you started (111:04 - 111:09)
and also but you can't stop it you've (111:06 - 111:11)
selected out of battle there's not a way (111:09 - 111:14)
there's no stopping say goodbye to your (111:11 - 111:16)
shiny never (111:14 - 111:17)
so out of the whole auto battles the (111:16 - 111:19)
only conversation i saw on twitter was (111:17 - 111:22)
like what if there's a shiny okay (111:19 - 111:24)
don't send them into auto battle okay (111:22 - 111:26)
stop the auto battle okay (111:24 - 111:29)
you can't see it so you would never know (111:26 - 111:31)
like what you're on the other side of (111:29 - 111:32)
the map you're in a cave you can't see (111:31 - 111:34)
it you'll never know do you know how (111:32 - 111:36)
many shiny pokemon you probably walk (111:34 - 111:38)
past and sword and shield every single (111:36 - 111:40)
day you play that game you know why you (111:38 - 111:42)
you don't get them all (111:40 - 111:43)
yeah (111:42 - 111:45)
it takes greg one month to get from one (111:43 - 111:47)
side of the wild area to the other (111:45 - 111:48)
because (111:47 - 111:50)
it's so hard for me to play games no but (111:48 - 111:52)
they're adding in for the auto battle (111:50 - 111:54)
feature is a message that pops up that (111:52 - 111:57)
says you just killed a shiny (111:54 - 111:59)
exactly like we we don't know how (111:57 - 112:01)
pokemon populate in this game (111:59 - 112:04)
so so in a game like let's go pikachu (112:01 - 112:06)
let's go eevee a pokemon would spawn for (112:04 - 112:08)
60 seconds and then after 60 seconds it (112:06 - 112:10)
would despawn and then a new pokemon (112:08 - 112:12)
would spawn in that place if you're in (112:10 - 112:14)
somewhere like the viridian forest (112:12 - 112:15)
you're probably gonna be another (112:14 - 112:17)
caterpie because that's the highest (112:15 - 112:18)
encounter rate there (112:17 - 112:21)
in pokemon sword and shield pokemon do (112:18 - 112:23)
not (112:21 - 112:27)
respawn unless they are encountered (112:23 - 112:30)
and then either run away catch battle (112:27 - 112:32)
right so all of those pokemon that exist (112:30 - 112:34)
in sword and shield if you boot up sword (112:32 - 112:36)
and shield go to the wild area stand in (112:34 - 112:38)
front of a group of pokemon and then (112:36 - 112:40)
keep your switch on those pokemon will (112:38 - 112:42)
be exactly the same (112:40 - 112:44)
the entire time unless you do something (112:42 - 112:46)
with them (112:44 - 112:49)
um and if you save the game right there (112:46 - 112:50)
turn it back on the next day all of (112:49 - 112:52)
those pokemon are exactly the same same (112:50 - 112:54)
stats statement same abilities same (112:52 - 112:56)
chance of being you know if it was shiny (112:54 - 112:58)
last night you waited a week it'll still (112:56 - 113:00)
be shiny when you run into it it's all (112:58 - 113:02)
determined once they initially spawn (113:00 - 113:04)
in legends (113:02 - 113:07)
they all determine whether they are (113:04 - 113:09)
shiny or not or whether they have (113:07 - 113:12)
certain stats when that initial map (113:09 - 113:14)
loads and there are five maps in that (113:12 - 113:15)
game (113:14 - 113:16)
and there (113:15 - 113:18)
there are (113:16 - 113:20)
situations where (113:18 - 113:22)
a pokemon does (113:20 - 113:25)
more pokemon spawn after like uh like (113:22 - 113:27)
you know uh whether they were they (113:25 - 113:30)
called swarms not swarms um yeah (113:27 - 113:32)
yeah yeah swarms (113:30 - 113:33)
but like if you went to the monkey (113:32 - 113:36)
island where there's uh infernape and (113:33 - 113:38)
then like two chimp chars (113:36 - 113:40)
and you (113:38 - 113:41)
deal with those three (113:40 - 113:44)
new chimp chars do not replace it it's (113:41 - 113:46)
just the island is now empty (113:44 - 113:47)
right like (113:46 - 113:49)
you you you battled the infernape caught (113:47 - 113:51)
the infernape you scared away the two (113:49 - 113:53)
tymptars like (113:51 - 113:55)
you have to leave that entire map and (113:53 - 113:57)
come back for those to phase in now we (113:55 - 114:00)
know that this is open world (113:57 - 114:01)
so (114:00 - 114:03)
if you send your lechonk (114:01 - 114:05)
to battle (114:03 - 114:09)
a bunch of fido (114:05 - 114:09)
if if there's six fido there (114:09 - 114:13)
and the le chunk defeats the six and (114:14 - 114:19)
then another six pop up (114:17 - 114:21)
and a shiny pops up right (114:19 - 114:24)
you would be there to say okay stop (114:21 - 114:26)
battling i am going to go catch that (114:24 - 114:27)
shiny (114:26 - 114:29)
or you would not be there visually (114:27 - 114:30)
seeing (114:29 - 114:32)
so you would have no clue like you just (114:30 - 114:34)
wouldn't no (114:32 - 114:36)
so the whole like well what if there's a (114:34 - 114:38)
shiny the question is (114:36 - 114:40)
are you paying attention (114:38 - 114:43)
or not like that that's the question (114:40 - 114:46)
like it's it's the same as like legends (114:43 - 114:49)
is like if a shiny pops up did you hear (114:46 - 114:50)
it because (114:49 - 114:51)
at the end of the day the question (114:50 - 114:53)
you're asking yourself is are you paying (114:51 - 114:54)
attention (114:53 - 114:56)
yes it's very schrodinger's cat you will (114:54 - 114:58)
only know (114:56 - 115:00)
if it's shiny or not if you look (114:58 - 115:03)
and once you do you've set what it is (115:00 - 115:06)
like like there i and i i stream on (115:03 - 115:07)
twitch this is well known you should (115:06 - 115:10)
come over and (115:07 - 115:12)
follow on twitch.tv (115:10 - 115:14)
and cast stream a lot but there have (115:12 - 115:15)
been multiple times in legends argus (115:14 - 115:17)
where i didn't hear the shiny sound i (115:15 - 115:19)
didn't or there there's been a shiny in (115:17 - 115:21)
front of me like 700 feet away or (115:19 - 115:22)
whatever i can barely see it but (115:21 - 115:23)
somebody's like that's a shiny mercure (115:22 - 115:26)
and i was like that's a speck of purple (115:23 - 115:28)
how is your eyesight that good but (115:26 - 115:29)
you're right that part that macro is not (115:28 - 115:31)
black it is purple (115:29 - 115:33)
but if the twitch chat wasn't there i (115:31 - 115:35)
would just go along my day and i would (115:33 - 115:37)
have never known therefore how would i (115:35 - 115:40)
be upset if i didn't know (115:37 - 115:43)
like (115:40 - 115:43)
what if there's a shiny in auto (115:43 - 115:47)
battles if you're are if you're there (115:45 - 115:49)
then stop the auto battle and deal with (115:47 - 115:52)
the shiny if you're not there (115:49 - 115:55)
it's okay well no the actual answer is (115:52 - 115:57)
if you care that much about finding (115:55 - 116:01)
shinies don't know about it use (115:57 - 116:01)
maybe it's not worth it to do it maybe (116:04 - 116:08)
like i mean maybe you're only getting (116:07 - 116:10)
potions from the items maybe you're only (116:08 - 116:13)
getting so much xp maybe (116:10 - 116:16)
uh you know the area has too many (116:13 - 116:17)
different pokemon so it's not even good (116:16 - 116:19)
for eevee training because you want to (116:17 - 116:21)
be a specific eevee like there are so (116:19 - 116:22)
many (116:21 - 116:24)
questions about this of like (116:22 - 116:26)
hey i want to especially i want to ev (116:24 - 116:28)
train and attack the chunks give attack (116:26 - 116:30)
this is i'm just guessing the chunks (116:28 - 116:32)
give attack there's an area of le chance (116:30 - 116:34)
so go battle these lachangs as i go do (116:32 - 116:36)
something else so then your eevees (116:34 - 116:39)
increase but the chunk is totally hp (116:36 - 116:41)
you're right yeah the chunk is actually (116:39 - 116:43)
probably hp honestly yeah chunky chunk (116:41 - 116:45)
chunk um (116:43 - 116:47)
you get chunky when you battle chunks (116:45 - 116:49)
i think it's cool (116:47 - 116:51)
i think (116:49 - 116:51)
i think it's exciting (116:51 - 116:54)
you know (116:53 - 116:57)
i was hoping that the the pc stuff and (116:54 - 116:59)
sword and shield the job system would be (116:57 - 117:03)
just as good as pokemon peligo (116:59 - 117:06)
but peligo is still probably the best (117:03 - 117:08)
what should i do with my pokemon when (117:06 - 117:11)
i'm not using these pokemon in battle (117:08 - 117:12)
i don't think anything comes close to (117:11 - 117:14)
peligo (117:12 - 117:15)
so (117:14 - 117:17)
if (117:15 - 117:19)
i hope that the let's go is (117:17 - 117:21)
on par with how (117:19 - 117:24)
peligo was of like i i need this pokemon (117:21 - 117:26)
to do something (117:24 - 117:27)
but it also seems like you only do one (117:26 - 117:29)
at a time (117:27 - 117:33)
i need a hatchetarium for my eggs yeah (117:29 - 117:36)
i need a berry farm and a hatchetarium (117:33 - 117:39)
yeah peligo was really good just (117:36 - 117:40)
i'm gonna get i'm gonna check a bunch of (117:39 - 117:42)
berries i'm gonna check all my like (117:40 - 117:44)
minerals and mining things yeah get my (117:42 - 117:46)
starbucks pokemon into a cave and see (117:44 - 117:49)
what happens i'm gonna put these pokemon (117:46 - 117:50)
in the jungle gym they're gonna level up (117:49 - 117:52)
i'm gonna put these pokemon in the spa (117:50 - 117:54)
they're going to hatch like (117:52 - 117:56)
pelican was good i thought it was really (117:54 - 117:58)
good pelican like (117:56 - 118:00)
pelican was a great idea because i (117:58 - 118:04)
always felt it always feels like (118:00 - 118:04)
something should be happening when i'm (118:05 - 118:08)
not playing in this game like i have all (118:06 - 118:10)
these eggs (118:08 - 118:11)
something should be happening to them (118:10 - 118:13)
while i'm not actively having to run (118:11 - 118:15)
around in a circle and bella go help (118:13 - 118:17)
deal with that (118:15 - 118:19)
yeah except that poor man lost his wife (118:17 - 118:21)
and children (118:19 - 118:22)
that's true (118:21 - 118:25)
he just lost his memory of his wife and (118:22 - 118:26)
children (118:25 - 118:28)
and they didn't know he was on this (118:26 - 118:29)
weird island (118:28 - 118:31)
i was still waiting for dlc when they (118:29 - 118:35)
finally reunite them all together (118:31 - 118:35)
uh question of the week i think i think (118:36 - 118:39)
that was it i i there's probably (118:38 - 118:40)
something in the trailer we're missing (118:39 - 118:42)
but i think we we covered a lot look we (118:40 - 118:43)
spent (118:42 - 118:45)
over an hour on three minutes so (118:43 - 118:47)
i was like oh we're gonna do the rest of (118:45 - 118:49)
the week usually we cut it okay (118:47 - 118:50)
question (118:49 - 118:52)
of the week (118:50 - 118:54)
what is it (118:52 - 118:57)
it's the question of the week (118:54 - 118:57)
matt sent in the uh (118:59 - 119:01)
the (119:00 - 119:04)
marshadow distribution uh in our attic (119:01 - 119:06)
channel (119:04 - 119:08)
um (119:06 - 119:10)
where is our question of the week did we (119:08 - 119:11)
not post one in the slack i think we're (119:10 - 119:13)
gonna do all (119:11 - 119:14)
trailer (119:13 - 119:17)
yeah you're right i didn't do it there (119:14 - 119:19)
was one good there was one good youtube (119:17 - 119:21)
question and i gotta pull it up now i (119:19 - 119:22)
thought i was just gonna do every time (119:21 - 119:23)
there's a trailer you're like we're (119:22 - 119:25)
cutting it so i'm like well yeah (119:23 - 119:28)
yeah but we took we took a proper break (119:25 - 119:30)
okay see that's the thing i i i (119:28 - 119:34)
fit in the proper break (119:30 - 119:34)
um (119:36 - 119:39)
here we go this is from pokemaniac (119:45 - 119:51)
why does the bus have a tongue (119:47 - 119:51)
because it's a pokemon it's a pokemon (119:51 - 119:56)
this is your narrative this is it is (119:53 - 119:59)
but it is a licking (119:56 - 120:01)
machine i (119:59 - 120:02)
gross (120:01 - 120:04)
i had not seen (120:02 - 120:06)
the art that you were referencing (120:04 - 120:09)
previously i have now looked it up and i (120:06 - 120:10)
will say this (120:09 - 120:13)
i do not think that the truck it is not (120:10 - 120:16)
a bus the truck is a pokemon (120:13 - 120:17)
i think (120:16 - 120:19)
that either (120:17 - 120:21)
as steve said the engine (120:19 - 120:23)
is the pokemon (120:21 - 120:27)
or they have a pokemon trapped what if (120:23 - 120:29)
it's a rotom (120:27 - 120:31)
protons don't have tongues bad not not (120:29 - 120:34)
when they were in other fans but in this (120:31 - 120:35)
monster truck (120:34 - 120:37)
did they get a tongue and an eye rotom (120:35 - 120:41)
lick yeah (120:37 - 120:41)
the new mobile game coming out this fall (120:41 - 120:47)
road tumble hotel blick (120:43 - 120:47)
it's a pokemon the engine is a pokemon (120:49 - 120:56)
oh i think there's a pokemon inside (120:53 - 120:58)
okay i have a i have a i actually have a (120:56 - 121:00)
valid question right now because all (120:58 - 121:01)
vehicles in this region greg is the (121:00 - 121:05)
question of the week how meta i (121:01 - 121:05)
what are our feelings of the oled (121:05 - 121:09)
pokemon scarlet violet especially oh (121:07 - 121:11)
yeah that was the last bit of news uh i (121:09 - 121:13)
think it's great (121:11 - 121:16)
i since i don't have an oled i'm (121:13 - 121:18)
planning on buying it i think the back (121:16 - 121:20)
is really messy but i never look at the (121:18 - 121:22)
back so what do i care what i like the (121:20 - 121:23)
back (121:22 - 121:25)
oh it's just too messy for me it reminds (121:23 - 121:27)
me of uh (121:25 - 121:29)
i love the i love the thing i keep mine (121:27 - 121:31)
in my tv all the time so the fact that (121:29 - 121:33)
the front is the super cool white clean (121:31 - 121:35)
thing into it love it love it what i (121:33 - 121:38)
don't understand about the back (121:35 - 121:40)
first off i love the back i think it's (121:38 - 121:41)
great but i'm a big fan of purple and (121:40 - 121:43)
orange what i don't understand about the (121:41 - 121:46)
back though is that you have quaxley you (121:43 - 121:48)
have fue coco you have sprigatito you (121:46 - 121:50)
have like the the school symbols and (121:48 - 121:52)
then just you just have a hat then i'm (121:50 - 121:53)
back there just (121:52 - 121:58)
you just have but it's a it's a hat tana (121:53 - 122:00)
symbol like it says something under it (121:58 - 122:02)
so it's like it's like a business yeah (122:00 - 122:05)
or like yeah i was like (122:02 - 122:06)
is this like (122:05 - 122:09)
is this like a set of (122:06 - 122:11)
fairy type bakeries like that's their (122:09 - 122:12)
symbol (122:11 - 122:15)
but they're the only two non-gen eight (122:12 - 122:17)
pokemon and they're sorry gen nine (122:15 - 122:18)
pokemon there are three gen 9 pokemon (122:17 - 122:20)
the starters (122:18 - 122:22)
are go goat (122:20 - 122:25)
which is in a symbol and then the hatana (122:22 - 122:26)
so (122:25 - 122:28)
that is my actual problem with the back (122:26 - 122:31)
is you have two older generation pokemon (122:28 - 122:32)
that are just randomly on the back of (122:31 - 122:34)
this that yeah but (122:32 - 122:37)
do we think given the fact that we just (122:34 - 122:39)
talked about the star stuff and the (122:37 - 122:41)
school logos and there's a steam there's (122:39 - 122:45)
like a star like are these (122:41 - 122:45)
hinting towards other (122:46 - 122:49)
businesses are the hinting towards the (122:48 - 122:52)
factions if there are eight factions or (122:49 - 122:56)
17 factions are these their graffiti (122:52 - 122:59)
symbols like there's a lot it's got a (122:56 - 123:01)
very graffiti feel to the end and we (122:59 - 123:03)
know there's a graffiti artist (123:01 - 123:05)
in the game so like (123:03 - 123:08)
because of all that it's super graffiti (123:05 - 123:10)
busy to me (123:08 - 123:13)
yeah i mean i i like the busyness i i (123:10 - 123:16)
would i don't have a lot of faith in the (123:13 - 123:18)
fact that there are multiple businesses (123:16 - 123:19)
or symbols because they already pulled (123:18 - 123:21)
that card in sword and shield with all (123:19 - 123:23)
the sponsors and they were like look at (123:21 - 123:25)
all these great sponsor logos we made (123:23 - 123:27)
and we put them on leon's cape and we (123:25 - 123:28)
put them all around the stadiums and (123:27 - 123:31)
like the pokemon job thing like takes (123:28 - 123:33)
advantage of the sponsors but they (123:31 - 123:34)
literally do nothing with it like (123:33 - 123:36)
everything i just mentioned is is just (123:34 - 123:37)
fluff (123:36 - 123:39)
yeah would they do nothing with it on (123:37 - 123:41)
the back of this thing either it's just (123:39 - 123:45)
fluff it's just decoration yeah (123:41 - 123:48)
all the release of this oled switch (123:45 - 123:50)
means is that they will soon be (123:48 - 123:52)
discontinuing this version of the switch (123:50 - 123:54)
or the switch altogether and releasing a (123:52 - 123:56)
new console because they always come out (123:54 - 123:58)
with a special pokemon edition yeah and (123:56 - 124:00)
a month later yeah like we don't do this (123:58 - 124:02)
we don't do this anymore any longer will (124:00 - 124:04)
is correct they've they've done this (124:02 - 124:05)
multiple times they're like here's a (124:04 - 124:07)
pokemon edition of a product here's a (124:05 - 124:09)
brand new console (124:07 - 124:11)
brand new console is like (124:09 - 124:13)
probably like an upgraded (124:11 - 124:14)
you know slightly better processor kind (124:13 - 124:16)
of thing (124:14 - 124:18)
i want it are you running a contest and (124:16 - 124:21)
if so how can i cheat the contest yeah i (124:18 - 124:24)
mean like i've always given away a (124:21 - 124:26)
nintendo switch uh near the release of a (124:24 - 124:28)
new pokemon game those giveaways usually (124:26 - 124:30)
do really well you know it's i'm very (124:28 - 124:33)
happy to like give back to (124:30 - 124:34)
people who listen to the show or watch (124:33 - 124:36)
the twitch streams or or (124:34 - 124:37)
whatever (124:36 - 124:38)
um (124:37 - 124:39)
i don't know how hard or easy these will (124:38 - 124:41)
be to find you know what's funny is like (124:39 - 124:44)
the animal crossing switch was so hard (124:41 - 124:46)
to find and now you can walk into a (124:44 - 124:48)
target and they're literally everywhere (124:46 - 124:50)
they're like not actually rare but there (124:48 - 124:52)
was this weird artificial rarity when (124:50 - 124:53)
they first came out (124:52 - 124:56)
um same with some of the pokemon stuff (124:53 - 124:57)
like (124:56 - 124:59)
the let's go pikachu let's go eevee (124:57 - 125:00)
switch was again really hard to find off (124:59 - 125:02)
the bat and then at a certain point i (125:00 - 125:04)
mean that switch is pretty old now but (125:02 - 125:06)
you could walk into a target and be like (125:04 - 125:09)
oh they have them in stock um (125:06 - 125:11)
some pokemon 3ds's were really hard to (125:09 - 125:13)
find and then there was those that that (125:11 - 125:15)
pokeball 2ds that they yeah made that (125:13 - 125:17)
was so easy to find like yeah but the (125:15 - 125:20)
2ds was bad the 2ds was bad bad plastic (125:17 - 125:22)
um i don't know how hard or easy this (125:20 - 125:24)
will be to find i (125:22 - 125:27)
i i like it i i like purple i like (125:24 - 125:30)
orange i i like the back (125:27 - 125:31)
i just (125:30 - 125:34)
99 of the time i'm touching my switch (125:31 - 125:37)
it's docked i i i just don't (125:34 - 125:39)
use handheld mode (125:37 - 125:40)
ever (125:39 - 125:42)
so like the feature of this is like the (125:40 - 125:45)
better screen and i have no doubt it's (125:42 - 125:47)
better i'm sure it looks great (125:45 - 125:50)
i just don't use handheld mode (125:47 - 125:51)
i mean (125:50 - 125:53)
i want it (125:51 - 125:56)
because it's a special edition (125:53 - 125:58)
and i don't have an oled and there are (125:56 - 126:00)
occasional times when i use it out of (125:58 - 126:03)
the dock enough that i'm like (126:00 - 126:05)
i don't have this version of the switch (126:03 - 126:08)
it is a special version so i do want to (126:05 - 126:10)
buy it (126:08 - 126:12)
i don't think it's like the handheld (126:10 - 126:13)
mode (126:12 - 126:15)
it's (126:13 - 126:15)
it's just if i'm if i'm going out of my (126:16 - 126:21)
house i'm usually playing pokemon go or (126:19 - 126:24)
playing some uh like it's probably (126:21 - 126:26)
pokemon go or like maybe masters if i'm (126:24 - 126:27)
sitting at like a coffee shop or (126:26 - 126:29)
something right like (126:27 - 126:31)
if i'm at home and i'm not streaming and (126:29 - 126:33)
i want to play something i want to like (126:31 - 126:35)
sit on my couch and put my feet up and (126:33 - 126:37)
play yeah but that's because due to the (126:35 - 126:39)
pandemic we didn't have (126:37 - 126:41)
saturday meetups where we all went to a (126:39 - 126:45)
caribou and raided together i mean yeah (126:41 - 126:47)
i guess we could do that but also you (126:45 - 126:49)
know when i played unite a couple times (126:47 - 126:50)
in handheld mode (126:49 - 126:52)
because i'm like i just need to do the i (126:50 - 126:54)
just need to do the one match it's bad (126:52 - 126:55)
because i think the joy cons are bad (126:54 - 126:57)
compared to the pro controller like i (126:55 - 126:59)
would rather just have a pro controller (126:57 - 127:01)
in my hands also my eyes are bad and (126:59 - 127:04)
it's hard to see in this yeah i i hate (127:01 - 127:06)
the joycons i i they're very small and i (127:04 - 127:08)
have small hands like literally on an (127:06 - 127:11)
airplane i will set up my switch (127:08 - 127:13)
like with the little kickstand and use a (127:11 - 127:16)
pro controller oh yeah (127:13 - 127:17)
yeah but then you have to pack your pro (127:16 - 127:21)
controller yeah so (127:17 - 127:22)
worth (127:21 - 127:24)
question pokemon of the week (127:22 - 127:27)
uh all right last time pokemon of the (127:24 - 127:31)
week referenced uh friends of dorothy (127:27 - 127:32)

in eight different pokemon games (127:35 - 127:39)
we don't know if it's going to be in (127:37 - 127:40)
scarlet and violet but we know (127:39 - 127:43)
competitively that it doesn't care about (127:40 - 127:46)
covert cloak because its hidden ability (127:43 - 127:49)
uh removes the secondary effect of moves (127:46 - 127:51)
that it uses anyways (127:49 - 127:53)
i mean friends of dorothy is really all (127:51 - 127:56)

and mid-community it's not when (130:09 - 130:13)
community day was ending i encountered a (130:11 - 130:16)
shiny toe dial and i caught it (130:13 - 130:18)
and when i caught it (130:16 - 130:21)
the summary screen turned into a regular (130:18 - 130:22)
not too (130:21 - 130:25)
i've i i still have this not too how are (130:22 - 130:30)
you still on this greg was there i was (130:25 - 130:31)
there (130:30 - 130:33)
and i'm (130:31 - 130:36)
how is this still a point of contention (130:33 - 130:38)
because because there was no trivia so i (130:36 - 130:40)
had to give my own trivia (130:38 - 130:42)
all right here we go we'll look it up (130:40 - 130:45)
i'm for sure i haven't yeah i'm ready (130:42 - 130:48)
i thought i had done this one before but (130:45 - 130:51)
i can't find a record of it (130:48 - 130:54)
when building my shiny bug team i (130:51 - 130:57)
purposefully fainted 50 of these a day (130:54 - 131:01)
on route 8 to increase the shiny odds (130:57 - 131:04)
while also hatching six every day (131:01 - 131:08)
ultimately battling 807 of them before (131:04 - 131:10)
finding a shiny (131:08 - 131:11)
unfortunately (131:10 - 131:14)
because the lowest level it can be found (131:11 - 131:16)
at is 38 (131:14 - 131:19)
it didn't work well in my early journeys (131:16 - 131:20)
in galler (131:19 - 131:22)
it also took so many battles to raise (131:20 - 131:24)
its level (131:22 - 131:26)
it evolved quite quickly after i finally (131:24 - 131:28)
could start using it (131:26 - 131:31)
now years later they are basically (131:28 - 131:35)
handing these shinies out in raids (131:31 - 131:35)
toe dial (131:37 - 131:43)
