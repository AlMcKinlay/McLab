hit record here am (0:00 - 0:04)
[Music] (0:05 - 0:17)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:15 - 0:20)
the 639 episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:17 - 0:23)
it&#39;s super effective I&#39;m your host Steve (0:20 - 0:27)
with me is Hannah I am here yep I have (0:23 - 0:30)
my Pokemon posters up that exciting Saga (0:27 - 0:32)
has uded (0:30 - 0:34)
finally we have made it to the Pokemon (0:32 - 0:37)
posters uh Bobby also (0:34 - 0:40)
here yes uh I last week I said I was (0:37 - 0:42)
swearing off raids in Pokemon go I have (0:40 - 0:45)
since done raids so that lasted six days (0:42 - 0:47)
but I haven&#39;t paid for any I have not (0:45 - 0:49)
paid for any raids so I will okay I (0:47 - 0:52)
stand strong on that the real (0:49 - 0:56)
winner um uh slow news week this week uh (0:52 - 1:00)
we got some news though don&#39;t worry we (0:56 - 1:01)
always (1:00 - 1:04)
news uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll go through (1:01 - 1:08)
it I I have uh on a on a personal level (1:04 - 1:12)
I have paused my twitch streams for the (1:08 - 1:14)
the for two weeks so if if you&#39;re (1:12 - 1:15)
listening to this and you&#39;re like why (1:14 - 1:18)
haven&#39;t you been on Twitch um I said I (1:15 - 1:20)
was going to take a break after I got (1:18 - 1:22)
back from South Korea and then they (1:20 - 1:27)
announced Infernape and I felt (1:22 - 1:27)
obligated to do Infernape raid builds (1:27 - 1:34)
and then do Infernape uh it is very (1:31 - 1:36)
possible that they announce a sevenstar (1:34 - 1:38)
raid tonight we record these on Sunday (1:36 - 1:40)
mornings they usually announce raids on (1:38 - 1:43)
Sunday nights um so that that&#39;s possible (1:40 - 1:45)
but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll talk about scarlet and (1:43 - 1:48)
violet later on in the show uh otherwise (1:45 - 1:51)
for like twitch stuff uh I&#39;ll probably (1:48 - 1:56)
be back on the 21st of this month um (1:51 - 1:58)
it&#39;s just like twitch is like out of (1:56 - 2:00)
everything I do twitch is like the most (1:58 - 2:03)
time time consuming (2:00 - 2:03)
thing so uh there there was obviously (2:03 - 2:08)
you&#39;re listening to this podcast they&#39;ll (2:07 - 2:09)
be another podcast next week and the (2:08 - 2:12)
week after and the week after so we (2:09 - 2:13)
don&#39;t miss a (2:12 - 2:16)
Monday (2:13 - 2:16)
yet well I don&#39;t know if if somehow I (2:16 - 2:22)
can&#39;t record Hannah has the capability (2:19 - 2:25)
of I&#39;ll put Hannah in charge yes there&#39;s (2:22 - 2:28)
always a backup plan (2:25 - 2:30)
possible uh (2:28 - 2:33)
speaking of backup plans Pokemon sleep (2:30 - 2:38)
check in but there how how is your what (2:33 - 2:40)
you what what do we even call this the (2:38 - 2:44)
like old gold power plant debut Pokemon (2:40 - 2:47)
that could either be on green grass or (2:44 - 2:49)
the power plant I&#39;m assuming you both (2:47 - 2:50)
went (2:49 - 2:54)
to Green Grass yeah and actually my (2:50 - 2:56)
backup plan didn&#39;t work speaking of (2:54 - 2:59)
backup plans cuz (2:56 - 3:03)
um I I had a busy work week and did that (2:59 - 3:05)
thing where I keep track in the sleep (3:03 - 3:07)
and just decide I will check in with (3:05 - 3:11)
Pokemon sleep when I can and because of (3:07 - 3:15)
that I missed out on encountering (3:11 - 3:18)
Pokemon that I wanted to catch and so (3:15 - 3:20)
I&#39;ve brought it up on the podcast before (3:18 - 3:22)
when you miss a few days but still have (3:20 - 3:24)
the data it&#39;ll kind of recap that for (3:22 - 3:27)
you and it will have automatically given (3:24 - 3:29)
biscuits to some Pokemon so it&#39;ll (3:27 - 3:31)
automatically cat some Pokemon for the (3:29 - 3:34)
days that you kind of missed right and (3:31 - 3:35)
it didn&#39;t give biscuits to the right (3:34 - 3:39)
Pokemon and I saw that it it found the (3:35 - 3:41)
new Pokemon and it didn&#39;t give biscuits (3:39 - 3:42)
to them and I think I got like a (3:41 - 3:47)
Caterpie or something instead CER is (3:42 - 3:51)
close to grubbin yeah not close (3:47 - 3:54)
enough and so I was very disappointed (3:51 - 3:57)
and I regretted missing checking in on (3:54 - 3:59)
Pokemon sleep for a couple days this (3:57 - 4:00)
week (3:59 - 4:05)
H that&#39;s that&#39;s unfortunate so when you (4:00 - 4:07)
skip a couple days this is just assuming (4:05 - 4:10)
you have biscuits to give it just (4:07 - 4:12)
randomly gives them or does it just give (4:10 - 4:15)
daily biscuit yeah so it just gives the (4:12 - 4:19)
daily one to a Pokemon yep I&#39;m assuming (4:15 - 4:20)
it gives the daily biscuit to the one (4:19 - 4:21)
that&#39;s (4:20 - 4:24)
hungry I&#39;m not sure if you can tell that (4:21 - 4:26)
it just gives it to a random Pokemon I (4:24 - 4:29)
think okay well did did you catch the (4:26 - 4:30)
Caterpie (4:29 - 4:33)
yeah so then it had to have given it it (4:30 - 4:35)
had to have been more than four or it (4:33 - 4:37)
was already or it already had some (4:35 - 4:38)
biscuits before that was it a good (4:37 - 4:41)
Caterpie (4:38 - 4:43)
no it was not a good (4:41 - 4:46)
Caterpie well Bobby you also went to (4:43 - 4:49)
Green Grass I did I did yeah I I just (4:46 - 4:53)
hit uh 290 um on (4:49 - 4:57)
lapis what yeah that I mean no uh lapis (4:53 - 4:59)
is 240 oh okay okay okay but I just hit (4:57 - 5:02)
the 290 goal like so I&#39;m still 50 I&#39;m (4:59 - 5:05)
you know I&#39;m like 47 or 46 now away from (5:02 - 5:08)
being able to go to the power plant but (5:05 - 5:11)
yeah I did green grass (5:08 - 5:16)
I slept every day so you know I mean I (5:11 - 5:19)
whoa breaking news (5:16 - 5:22)
didn GL you didn&#39;t pull an all nighter (5:19 - 5:22)
no (5:22 - 5:25)
I well I sleep twice a day there were a (5:22 - 5:27)
couple days where I went to bed very (5:25 - 5:29)
close to 4:00 a.m. and was a little (5:27 - 5:33)
worried I was going to miss the the um (5:29 - 5:36)
you know the cut off because with the go (5:33 - 5:39)
Plus+ you tell it right you tell it when (5:36 - 5:41)
you go to bed you know so oh I see what (5:39 - 5:42)
you&#39;re saying but with the Apple watch (5:41 - 5:44)
you don&#39;t right so it&#39;s like if the (5:42 - 5:46)
Apple watch didn&#39;t think so it&#39;s (5:44 - 5:47)
interesting because with the go Plus+ (5:46 - 5:49)
even though you have to have like the 10 (5:47 - 5:53)
minutes of whatever no movement I guess (5:49 - 5:54)
before it starts to say that you&#39;re (5:53 - 5:56)
asleep when you push that button that&#39;s (5:54 - 5:58)
actually the start of it so like even if (5:56 - 6:00)
you push that button at 3:59 you&#39;re (5:58 - 6:02)
going to get that like sleep at that (6:00 - 6:03)
point right but the Apple watch doesn&#39;t (6:02 - 6:05)
work like that obviously or smartw (6:03 - 6:07)
watches don&#39;t work like that so I had a (6:05 - 6:09)
few nights where it was like 355 and I (6:07 - 6:10)
was like (6:09 - 6:14)
oh they still count what they did still (6:10 - 6:15)
count though yeah yeah yeah they still (6:14 - 6:17)
count it so so I got so I got new (6:15 - 6:20)
Pokemon uh none of them were good all of (6:17 - 6:23)
them were terrible so far so um I (6:20 - 6:26)
haven&#39;t used any of the incense yet (6:23 - 6:29)
though so I will probably use those this (6:26 - 6:31)
week I I saw that they will not work on (6:29 - 6:35)
green grass um after the 30th of October (6:31 - 6:37)
I believe that&#39;s how it was for lapis as (6:35 - 6:40)
well okay so yeah if you don&#39;t use the (6:37 - 6:41)
you don&#39;t lose them no you don&#39;t lose (6:40 - 6:42)
them they just only work on power plant (6:41 - 6:45)
like they just unavailable to be used on (6:42 - 6:48)
green grass after October 30th yeah so (6:45 - 6:50)
uh I&#39;ll probably use them this week at (6:48 - 6:55)
some point just to to use them but yeah (6:50 - 6:58)
it&#39;s fine it&#39;s it&#39;s a fine event I don&#39;t (6:55 - 7:00)
know it&#39;s I think it&#39;s a more Style (6:58 - 7:04)
obviously you know get my way to 340 at (7:00 - 7:07)
some point here um (7:04 - 7:10)
and yeah haven&#39;t uh haven&#39;t used any of (7:07 - 7:11)
them though yet haven&#39;t gotten any (7:10 - 7:14)
coffee you know so haven&#39;t haven&#39;t (7:11 - 7:17)
started that process how about you Steve (7:14 - 7:21)
um I did not take my own advice and I (7:17 - 7:23)
went to power plant of (7:21 - 7:26)
course uh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t regret it (7:23 - 7:29)
though uh as of once I once I do lunch (7:26 - 7:30)
I&#39;ll be Master five (7:29 - 7:33)
oh oh wow at Power Plant I was actually (7:30 - 7:36)
talking about this with uh Nick in the (7:33 - 7:39)
the slack where power plant seems so (7:36 - 7:42)
much easier than lapis like I I I I (7:39 - 7:45)
remember being at lapis for probably (7:42 - 7:46)
like four weeks before I got to like (7:45 - 7:50)
Master One like without a a a ticket a (7:46 - 7:53)
good camp ticket and I think the the (7:50 - 7:55)
difference is it&#39;s been so long since (7:53 - 8:01)
lapis that my meals were increased yeah (7:55 - 8:04)
ined electric (8:01 - 8:09)
evest foro made meest into like a Raichu (8:04 - 8:11)
and an amperos and stuff and so those (8:09 - 8:13)
really help plus you have the plus plus (8:11 - 8:15)
Pikachu yes plus the plus plus Pikachu (8:13 - 8:19)
right which also helps on that um so (8:15 - 8:21)
it&#39;s funny (8:19 - 8:25)
because this past week I have felt so (8:21 - 8:27)
invested in (8:25 - 8:29)
sleep like to the when I say invested I (8:27 - 8:32)
mean like I I&#39;m genuinely excited every (8:29 - 8:34)
single morning again to be like (8:32 - 8:36)
hopefully I got a grubbin or an Aeron or (8:34 - 8:37)
a (8:36 - 8:40)
shins took streams off he&#39;s got to play (8:37 - 8:42)
sleep all day long this is actually why (8:40 - 8:45)
I canel streams I needed to optimize my (8:42 - 8:48)
sleep time two weeks this event ends and (8:45 - 8:50)
you said you&#39;re coming back October 21st (8:48 - 8:54)
so I really needed to double down on my (8:50 - 8:56)
Pokemon sleep um the den is also on (8:54 - 8:57)
power (8:56 - 9:01)
plant but uh I feel I feel like almost (8:57 - 9:03)
compelled to give this game money and to (9:01 - 9:05)
spend because I&#39;m just tearing through (9:03 - 9:07)
biscuits (9:05 - 9:09)
normally I (9:07 - 9:12)
would like Le let&#39;s say like a Caterpie (9:09 - 9:14)
is hungry because Caterpie can obviously (9:12 - 9:17)
be on hanon power knows (9:14 - 9:20)
that if if if I see like a hungry (9:17 - 9:23)
Caterpie and a non- hungry grubbin I (9:20 - 9:26)
would I would put my my premium biscuit (9:23 - 9:27)
into the grubbin and then I would use (9:26 - 9:29)
one Pokey biscuit and then boom I caught (9:27 - 9:30)
the grubbin I would just ignore the (9:29 - 9:32)
Caterpie all together don&#39;t care it&#39;s (9:30 - 9:35)
hungry don&#39;t need it same just skip it (9:32 - 9:36)
um and that&#39;s how I think most people (9:35 - 9:38)
should be playing right like just (9:36 - 9:40)
because you see an ekins is hungry it&#39;s (9:38 - 9:42)
still not worth your your free biscuit (9:40 - 9:44)
or your your regular biscuit ekins as as (9:42 - 9:46)
of this recording is still a really bad (9:44 - 9:49)
Pokemon um but but because there are so (9:46 - 9:51)
many Pokemon I want for power plant like (9:49 - 9:53)
I don&#39;t have a good Foy Coco I want (9:51 - 9:55)
Aeron I want Shinx I want grubbin I want (9:53 - 9:57)
drifloon which we&#39;re going to talk about (9:55 - 9:59)
I&#39;ve been doing the like okay two poke (9:57 - 10:01)
biscuits okay I&#39;ll give it the great (9:59 - 10:03)
biscuit so like every morning I&#39;m (10:01 - 10:06)
walking away with like four plus Pokemon (10:03 - 10:08)
I&#39;ve caught and I will report after this (10:06 - 10:10)
whole week they&#39;re all bad I haven&#39;t (10:08 - 10:12)
gotten a single good one (10:10 - 10:15)
yet they&#39;re they&#39;re I like they&#39;re all (10:12 - 10:19)
terrible but I I feel like with lapis (10:15 - 10:21)
when when lapis did the two weeks on (10:19 - 10:24)
green grass I felt like I should have (10:21 - 10:25)
played harder like I should have caught (10:24 - 10:27)
more routs I should have caught more (10:25 - 10:29)
shuffles because the reality is once (10:27 - 10:32)
that was over it felt like those Pokemon (10:29 - 10:33)
were like I still don&#39;t have a good (10:32 - 10:35)
routes lapis has been out for what like (10:33 - 10:37)
six plus months still don&#39;t have a good (10:35 - 10:40)
routes so I&#39;m I&#39;m worried that like when (10:37 - 10:43)
this event is over it will be tougher to (10:40 - 10:45)
see grubbin Aon shins just like it&#39;s (10:43 - 10:48)
kind of tough to see routes unless you (10:45 - 10:50)
get a specific sleeping style every (10:48 - 10:51)
night (10:50 - 10:56)
and um so I&#39;m having a good time with it (10:51 - 10:59)
I am really low on every single biscuit (10:56 - 11:00)
possible (10:59 - 11:02)
[Laughter] (11:00 - 11:05)
yeah so I don&#39;t like I have like over (11:02 - 11:08)
2,000 free gems so I could get like the (11:05 - 11:10)
$1,200 bundle or or whatever other (11:08 - 11:12)
bundle to get like five more Great Balls (11:10 - 11:14)
10 more Pokey biscuits that kind of (11:12 - 11:16)
stuff um but I&#39;m H I&#39;m genuinely having (11:14 - 11:19)
a good time with the G game and I think (11:16 - 11:22)
them secretly adding drif Loom and drif (11:19 - 11:28)
Blum to the game mid event was so (11:22 - 11:30)
delightful (11:28 - 11:32)
and on a Friday no less yes on a Friday (11:30 - 11:34)
I think there were some people saying (11:32 - 11:36)
like this this seems like an accident (11:34 - 11:37)
there was no (11:36 - 11:38)
announcement I don&#39;t think it was an (11:37 - 11:41)
accident at all I think like yeah it (11:38 - 11:44)
debuting on Friday which is like the the (11:41 - 11:46)
the the gimmick from like diamond and (11:44 - 11:48)
pearl and and and everything of them (11:46 - 11:51)
appearing on Fridays I think them (11:48 - 11:53)
secretly like putting it (11:51 - 11:56)
in on a Friday boosting it for everyone (11:53 - 11:57)
because it didn&#39;t matter what sleep (11:56 - 11:59)
style you had almost every single person (11:57 - 12:01)
person playing this game woke up to (11:59 - 12:03)
drifloon on (12:01 - 12:06)
Friday um I&#39;m sure there&#39;s one person (12:03 - 12:07)
listening being like I didn&#39;t get any (12:06 - 12:10)
drifloon but I haven&#39;t seen anyone not (12:07 - 12:13)
wake up to drifloon on Friday uh and (12:10 - 12:15)
then they drifloon having a brand new (12:13 - 12:16)
main skill which is the (12:15 - 12:18)
stockpile (12:16 - 12:21)
um and it is saying here available on (12:18 - 12:24)
green grass available on oil power plant (12:21 - 12:28)
normally dozing is when it appears uh I (12:24 - 12:30)
I just like (12:28 - 12:33)
it is nice when there is (12:30 - 12:35)
not it is nice when Pokemon games can (12:33 - 12:38)
like genuinely surprise you like no one (12:35 - 12:41)
knew that drift loon was coming yeah and (12:38 - 12:43)
it was nice that it wasn&#39;t tied to a (12:41 - 12:46)
Halloween event but took place in (12:43 - 12:48)
October also like I feel like that you (12:46 - 12:50)
know it&#39;s like it also took place like (12:48 - 12:52)
during October I mean there&#39;s this (12:50 - 12:54)
there&#39;s this other small Pokemon game (12:52 - 12:57)
called Pokémon go and they don&#39;t seem to (12:54 - 12:59)
like do the same thing in that way like (12:57 - 13:00)
where you know they could have had a (12:59 - 13:01)
Community Day in October that was (13:00 - 13:03)
Halloween related and they don&#39;t do that (13:01 - 13:05)
typically uh it&#39;s just kind of cool to (13:03 - 13:08)
see them do that and it&#39;s not related to (13:05 - 13:11)
a Halloween event so it was a nice just (13:08 - 13:14)
a nice surprise um not by name at least (13:11 - 13:18)
can we talk about the uh its ability or (13:14 - 13:22)
like its uh not ability but main skill (13:18 - 13:26)
main skill because so help me understand (13:22 - 13:28)
it a little bit I I was reading about it (13:26 - 13:30)
and I I I kind of understood it but it&#39;s (13:28 - 13:31)
like cuz it&#39;s two different things right (13:30 - 13:35)
it&#39;s like stockpile or spit up yes and (13:31 - 13:39)
so how exactly does that work it like (13:35 - 13:42)
stockpiles for a while and then it does (13:39 - 13:46)
the spit up thing so every time for my (13:42 - 13:48)
understanding and there&#39;s not uh I I did (13:46 - 13:50)
check the the hardcore Pokemon sleep (13:48 - 13:52)
subreddit and they they have reported (13:50 - 13:54)
that they don&#39;t know if this ability is (13:52 - 13:57)
actually like good or not right right (13:54 - 13:58)
too early to determine that was kind of (13:57 - 14:01)
my my wonder if it actually is going to (13:58 - 14:02)
be worth it like I understand how it (14:01 - 14:04)
works but I just wonder if it&#39;s going to (14:02 - 14:06)
be worth it yeah I think as of right now (14:04 - 14:08)
we don&#39;t know but ideally for somebody (14:06 - 14:10)
who doesn&#39;t know what it does uh when (14:08 - 14:12)
you have the little (14:10 - 14:15)
like ability is ready exclamation mark (14:12 - 14:17)
it is either going to stockpile or spit (14:15 - 14:20)
up that is random but if it chooses to (14:17 - 14:22)
stockpile it is going to get more and (14:20 - 14:24)
more powerful until it randomly chooses (14:22 - 14:27)
the spit up which then works like a gold (14:24 - 14:29)
duck or a Raichu or an Aeros where it&#39;s (14:27 - 14:34)
just adding charge power to snorlax&#39;s (14:29 - 14:36)
strength (14:34 - 14:40)
right and I think it&#39;s a specific number (14:36 - 14:44)
right it&#39;s not a range so every time (14:40 - 14:46)
you&#39;re stockpiling I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s (14:44 - 14:47)
that same number just being multip like (14:46 - 14:49)
so then like by the time it spits up (14:47 - 14:50)
it&#39;s that number multiplied by however (14:49 - 14:53)
many stock piles it had before that I (14:50 - 14:56)
believe so yes yeah (14:53 - 15:00)
okay yeah that might be fine (14:56 - 15:02)
yeah fine seems like the good the right (15:00 - 15:04)
word for that (15:02 - 15:06)
yeah uh when this podcast comes out (15:04 - 15:07)
there should be a new bundle in the (15:06 - 15:10)
store the drifloon bundle which is seven (15:07 - 15:12)
grape biscuits seven Pokey biscuits two (15:10 - 15:15)
drifloon incense and then 60 drifloon (15:12 - 15:18)
candy it&#39;ll be 1,500 diamonds which is (15:15 - 15:22)
like $20 by the way yeah poon sleep is (15:18 - 15:24)
expensive I was almost tempted by that (15:22 - 15:26)
because I actually missed this drift (15:24 - 15:29)
loon but I&#39;ll just be patient (15:26 - 15:31)
[Laughter] (15:29 - 15:33)
I&#39;ll come across one eventually it&#39;s (15:31 - 15:36)
fine yeah I got one and it wasn&#39;t any (15:33 - 15:40)
good I do like that it can be all corn (15:36 - 15:42)
for ingredients which is cool mine is (15:40 - 15:46)
not but that possibility is there (15:42 - 15:48)
because at this point I think the only (15:46 - 15:51)
ones that can be all corn are Stuffle (15:48 - 15:54)
maybe stuff not sure comfy I have comfy (15:51 - 15:57)
that has two corn comf can be all corn (15:54 - 16:02)
but comf real real bad Pokemon right now (15:57 - 16:05)
is it really yeah it&#39;s not good wait (16:02 - 16:07)
why what what&#39;s wrong with the com I (16:05 - 16:10)
have a really good (16:07 - 16:12)
comfy and it&#39;s it&#39;s just like there&#39;s (16:10 - 16:15)
there&#39;s just other Pokemon it&#39;s like as (16:12 - 16:17)
somebody who has like a a pseudo I have (16:15 - 16:19)
a shiny pseudo Widow that pretty much (16:17 - 16:23)
matches what an ideal gold duck would be (16:19 - 16:26)
okay and they do the same thing yeah and (16:23 - 16:29)
I think part of the reason why I got to (16:26 - 16:31)
Master 5 is because of that pseudo Widow (16:29 - 16:34)
because every time it procs it&#39;s like (16:31 - 16:38)
7,000 free charge power to the Snorlax (16:34 - 16:40)
yeah um and it&#39;s like shiny it was like (16:38 - 16:42)
my first shiny so like I don&#39;t regret or (16:40 - 16:44)
feel bad powering it up but if it was a (16:42 - 16:47)
Golduck it would do the same exact thing (16:44 - 16:48)
except it would proc a little bit more (16:47 - 16:50)
often and that number would be a little (16:48 - 16:53)
bit higher so it&#39;s like that&#39;s that&#39;s (16:50 - 16:55)
why when people like tiar list stuff (16:53 - 16:57)
it&#39;s just (16:55 - 17:01)
like pseudo Wows F gold a but like real (16:57 - 17:02)
realistically they do the same thing (17:01 - 17:05)
it&#39;s just one does it slightly better in (17:02 - 17:08)
like multiple ways so that&#39;s and so (17:05 - 17:09)
there are Pokemon that do it slightly (17:08 - 17:12)
better than com correct yeah yeah but (17:09 - 17:15)
com I mean like it&#39;s its main skill is (17:12 - 17:18)
just like isn&#39;t it just giving energy (17:15 - 17:20)
back to itself oh no it&#39;s it&#39;s one it (17:18 - 17:23)
gives energy to one random uh to one (17:20 - 17:26)
random Pokemon yeah but I just I don&#39;t (17:23 - 17:28)
know it&#39;s got corn it&#39;s got mine&#39;s got (17:26 - 17:31)
double corn if it has corn that&#39;s good (17:28 - 17:31)
like like I I I have advocated on this (17:32 - 17:37)
show that don&#39;t get obsessed with like (17:35 - 17:39)
trying to get like an srank Pokemon of (17:37 - 17:41)
every type because like again the power (17:39 - 17:44)
creep is already the the power creep (17:41 - 17:45)
with these three new Pokemon are already (17:44 - 17:49)
here like yeah egron is Agron is a (17:45 - 17:52)
better um sausage getter than (17:49 - 17:56)
Charizard uh I can&#39;t remember what else (17:52 - 18:00)
Aon can get uh but uh (17:56 - 18:03)
shins is a better potato or sorry tomato (18:00 - 18:05)
getter than Victory Bell it is also a (18:03 - 18:07)
better oil getter than toxic (18:05 - 18:11)
cro grubbin is the only Pokemon that can (18:07 - 18:13)
get three coffee (18:11 - 18:15)
like like it it&#39;s just it&#39;s just power (18:13 - 18:18)
create yeah So eventually something will (18:15 - 18:21)
beat Golduck or be better than Den or be (18:18 - 18:25)
better than guard of War like I don&#39;t (18:21 - 18:28)
know yeah don&#39;t don&#39;t feel bad I just (18:25 - 18:31)
always like like it&#39;s just every Pokemon (18:28 - 18:32)
I&#39;m investing and I feel like the new (18:31 - 18:34)
one that comes out is literally just (18:32 - 18:36)
like it&#39;s like that every single time (18:34 - 18:38)
and it&#39;s it&#39;s a little you know it&#39;s to (18:36 - 18:40)
the point where you know I have to not (18:38 - 18:42)
care obviously because if I do care I&#39;m (18:40 - 18:44)
gonna start spending money and that&#39;s (18:42 - 18:46)
the one thing I don&#39;t want to do in this (18:44 - 18:48)
game aside from the $10 monthly thing (18:46 - 18:51)
which is already wild but (18:48 - 18:54)
uh but yeah I&#39;m definitely trying to not (18:51 - 18:58)
spend money in this game and yeah this (18:54 - 19:00)
week actually I had a Den this morning I (18:58 - 19:03)
had a den and I used some sleep points (19:00 - 19:04)
for a couple great balls but I was like (19:03 - 19:06)
the thing I&#39;m not going to do is get a m (19:04 - 19:07)
is going to use a Master biscuit on this (19:06 - 19:09)
and I&#39;m sorry Hannah I know you did you (19:07 - 19:13)
on your Den way back I don&#39;t regret that (19:09 - 19:14)
but I already have a den and so I was (19:13 - 19:15)
like okay I&#39;m not GNA use a Master (19:14 - 19:18)
biscuit on this one and I&#39;m gonna keep (19:15 - 19:19)
myself from like using because I don&#39;t (19:18 - 19:20)
want to end up spending I just don&#39;t (19:19 - 19:22)
want to spend money on this game aside (19:20 - 19:25)
from the the subscription so you know (19:22 - 19:26)
sometimes I have to just put it down and (19:25 - 19:29)
be like it&#39;s fine like what I have is (19:26 - 19:32)
fine so yes you (19:29 - 19:35)
know and that&#39;s a success every time (19:32 - 19:38)
yeah speaking of spending money you (19:35 - 19:39)
could spend (19:38 - 19:44)
$100 Bobby on an alarm clock from (19:39 - 19:47)
Nintendo Yes I could I (19:44 - 19:51)
haven&#39;t but I almost want to I&#39;m so (19:47 - 19:53)
close to wanting to spend $100 on that (19:51 - 19:54)
alarm clock please tell me it&#39;s just (19:53 - 19:58)
because of the novelty value because I (19:54 - 19:59)
genuinely think this is the worst (19:58 - 20:02)
product Nintendo has ever released (19:59 - 20:06)
what yes not the Virtual Boy (20:02 - 20:11)
no nope not the virtual boy I think that (20:06 - 20:13)
this is this probably fine this is maybe (20:11 - 20:17)
the hottest take Hannah has ever on this (20:13 - 20:20)
podcast what&#39;s wrong with should we (20:17 - 20:22)
explain maybe maybe I should explain it (20:20 - 20:25)
first I know I know this is a Pokemon (20:22 - 20:27)
podcast but I think because we talk (20:25 - 20:29)
about poke because we are the premium (20:27 - 20:33)
exclusive only Pokemon sleep podcast in (20:29 - 20:35)
your favorite podcast app I think it&#39;s (20:33 - 20:37)
appropriate that we talk about the (20:35 - 20:39)
Nintendo sleep thing that came out since (20:37 - 20:41)
we do talk about sleep every week uh (20:39 - 20:45)
this is off the verge.com (20:41 - 20:47)
um uh this morning Nintendo announced a (20:45 - 20:52)
$99 alarm o clock H and it went on sale (20:47 - 20:55)
in The Company Store in Rockefeller (20:52 - 20:59)
Center uh so you you could you could buy (20:55 - 21:01)
buy it right away uh the other way to (20:59 - 21:05)
buy it was having a Nintendo (21:01 - 21:07)
subscription and then buying it off (21:05 - 21:08)
their website which I personally think (21:07 - 21:11)
as a side note very clever to prevent (21:08 - 21:14)
scalpers from buying it although I don&#39;t (21:11 - 21:16)
think any of the online orders has (21:14 - 21:18)
shipped I think the only way to get it (21:16 - 21:20)
right now was going to the Nintendo (21:18 - 21:24)
store in New York yep which it sold out (21:20 - 21:26)
just so you know surprise surprise it&#39;s (21:24 - 21:29)
not a limited time item so don&#39;t it will (21:26 - 21:32)
be back in (21:29 - 21:32)
stock um yeah uh the display is not a (21:32 - 21:39)
touchcreen nor is it round uh it does (21:36 - 21:41)
automatically adjust the brightness (21:39 - 21:43)
based on ambient lighting one fun detail (21:41 - 21:44)
is the clock screen and the type face (21:43 - 21:46)
will change depending on what alarm you (21:44 - 21:49)
have chosen whenever the regular clock (21:46 - 21:50)
is showing the character on screen will (21:49 - 21:52)
move left to right based on your (21:50 - 21:54)
movements uh or if you&#39;re in range of (21:52 - 21:56)
the motion centers you can control the (21:54 - 21:58)
alarmo with the buttons up top large (21:56 - 22:01)
dial can be turned to navigate the menus (21:58 - 22:03)
there is a back button and a left button (22:01 - 22:06)
uh and notification button to the (22:03 - 22:08)
right there&#39;s no serious health (22:06 - 22:11)
monitoring or anything like that uh (22:08 - 22:13)
Mario will not let you know that you&#39;re (22:11 - 22:15)
snoring well there&#39;s no microphones in (22:13 - 22:19)
it there&#39;s nothing like uh aside from (22:15 - 22:20)
the core function alarmo has a sleep (22:19 - 22:23)
sound that you can doze off to Nintendo (22:20 - 22:24)
plans to offer new sounds that can be (22:23 - 22:26)
downloaded to the clock once you&#39;ve (22:24 - 22:27)
linked your Nintendo (22:26 - 22:29)
account um (22:27 - 22:31)
and yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s some more (22:29 - 22:34)
details here uh they just said that they (22:31 - 22:35)
just kind of talked about their (22:34 - 22:38)
experience (22:35 - 22:41)
but uh it has five games or five themes (22:38 - 22:45)
I should say it has Mario Zelda uh ring (22:41 - 22:47)
fit (22:45 - 22:49)
Adventure uh (22:47 - 22:52)
Pikman and I can&#39;t remember the last one (22:49 - 22:54)
Splatoon Splatoon which I have something (22:52 - 22:59)
to say about at some in a minute here (22:54 - 22:59)
um so Bobby interested Hannah not (23:00 - 23:08)
interested again I think this is the (23:05 - 23:11)
worst product Nintendo has ever released (23:08 - 23:13)
not the virtual boy I think the virtual (23:11 - 23:15)
boy was ahead of its time and not the (23:13 - 23:17)
Wii U I think the Wii U led to a lot of (23:15 - 23:20)
really great things yeah wi to the (23:17 - 23:22)
switch I watched the video for this (23:20 - 23:24)
because okay cool new Nintendo product (23:22 - 23:26)
okay cool it has to do with sleep I am (23:24 - 23:29)
someone who tracks my sleep using four (23:26 - 23:31)
different apps every night I have read a (23:29 - 23:33)
book about sleep that I wish I could (23:31 - 23:36)
make many people read with some caveats (23:33 - 23:38)
um I think that this device is going to (23:36 - 23:40)
make people hate their favorite (23:38 - 23:42)
games (23:40 - 23:45)
subconsciously I don&#39;t know if either of (23:42 - 23:49)
you have ever set a favorite song as (23:45 - 23:52)
your alarm in the morning and then every (23:49 - 23:55)
morning you have to hear it when you (23:52 - 23:56)
have to wake up especially if you&#39;re (23:55 - 23:59)
going to school or going to work early (23:56 - 24:00)
in the morning before you want to wake (23:59 - 24:03)
up and it gets to the point where where (24:00 - 24:05)
whenever you listen to that favorite (24:03 - 24:10)
song of yours it just prompts a sense of (24:05 - 24:12)
[Music] (24:10 - 24:15)
panic and I think that this alarm clock (24:12 - 24:18)
is going to do that with all of people&#39;s (24:15 - 24:20)
favorite games not to mention the fact (24:18 - 24:23)
that after it goes off because it&#39;s (24:20 - 24:25)
motion sensing if you are rolling around (24:23 - 24:28)
in bed or moving at all if you are (24:25 - 24:30)
moving towards turning the alarm clock (24:28 - 24:31)
off it will get (24:30 - 24:34)
louder and make more sounds which I feel (24:31 - 24:37)
like incentivizes people to stay as (24:34 - 24:40)
still as humanly possible and just go (24:37 - 24:41)
back to (24:40 - 24:44)
sleep yes so for my my understanding and (24:41 - 24:46)
I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have one (24:44 - 24:49)
obviously that the alarm doesn&#39;t shut (24:46 - 24:51)
off until you physically get out of bed (24:49 - 24:54)
no but it makes more noise if you move (24:51 - 24:56)
well so a couple things to that okay so (24:54 - 24:58)
one you can set it so that you have to (24:56 - 24:59)
hit the button to turn off and it (24:58 - 25:02)
doesn&#39;t actually do the like wait till (24:59 - 25:05)
you get up to stop making noise you can (25:02 - 25:07)
set it to like a more traditional alarm (25:05 - 25:10)
clock setting for one (25:07 - 25:13)
two it makes yeah it makes sounds that (25:10 - 25:16)
are like in-game sounds as you&#39;re moving (25:13 - 25:18)
around so if for example if you have it (25:16 - 25:21)
set to the Mario theme As you move (25:18 - 25:23)
around you&#39;ll hear the sound of like (25:21 - 25:27)
coins as you&#39;re moving around um it does (25:23 - 25:30)
get more intense (25:27 - 25:32)
if you the longer you go from actually (25:30 - 25:35)
getting up so like if the alarm is going (25:32 - 25:38)
off for 5 minutes the music sounds one (25:35 - 25:40)
way if the alarm&#39;s been going off for 15 (25:38 - 25:42)
minutes the music gets more intense to (25:40 - 25:46)
try to get you up and out of bed so even (25:42 - 25:48)
staying as still as possible to like not (25:46 - 25:49)
have it do sounds isn&#39;t going to work (25:48 - 25:52)
because it&#39;ll get more intense as you (25:49 - 25:54)
don&#39;t but that doesn&#39;t change the fact (25:52 - 25:55)
that I think it&#39;s going to make people (25:54 - 25:57)
subconsciously hate their own game their (25:55 - 25:59)
favorite games yeah I I disagree with (25:57 - 26:03)
you I okay I&#39;ve told this story before I (25:59 - 26:05)
will tell it again there was uh gosh (26:03 - 26:07)
what is the name of this there was an (26:05 - 26:10)
alarm clock maybe it was called Clocky (26:07 - 26:12)
it was like a it was an alarm clock that (26:10 - 26:15)
had Wheels ah yes and and the concept (26:12 - 26:18)
behind it is when it goes off it will (26:15 - 26:23)
drive off your bedand and it was like (26:18 - 26:26)
randomized and it will it will ideally (26:23 - 26:28)
drive away from you forcing you to get (26:26 - 26:31)
out of bed to catch it to turn it off (26:28 - 26:33)
and I was like this is perfect cuz I&#39;m (26:31 - 26:34)
I&#39;m definitely one of those people that (26:33 - 26:36)
hit snooze over and over like I&#39;m I&#39;m (26:34 - 26:37)
also one of those people that set like (26:36 - 26:41)
20 alarms right same same like the best (26:37 - 26:44)
alarm for me is just like scheduling (26:41 - 26:46)
like a dentist appointment early in the (26:44 - 26:47)
morning or a haircut like that will 100% (26:46 - 26:49)
get me out of bed but like if I don&#39;t (26:47 - 26:51)
got the stress going on if I don&#39;t if I (26:49 - 26:52)
don&#39;t have anything (26:51 - 26:55)
to sense of urgency then I&#39;m I&#39;m (26:52 - 26:57)
definitely like I&#39;ll hit snooze over and (26:55 - 26:59)
over um so anyway anyways I buy the I (26:57 - 27:01)
buy the Clocky I think it&#39;s called (26:59 - 27:04)
Clocky and and it is so loud and (27:01 - 27:06)
obnoxious right it&#39;s not even like the (27:04 - 27:09)
the annoying noise it makes it is like (27:06 - 27:11)
the slamming of like leaving your (27:09 - 27:14)
bedside table and hitting the floor and (27:11 - 27:19)
it developed in me a sense of being so (27:14 - 27:22)
terrified of it going off I would wake (27:19 - 27:26)
up before it goes off because I was so (27:22 - 27:29)
terrified of it going off and then (27:26 - 27:30)
making the noise and then like rolling (27:29 - 27:33)
under my bed where I like I can&#39;t get it (27:30 - 27:35)
and then it it was so loud and I stopped (27:33 - 27:38)
using it completely (27:35 - 27:41)
um I don&#39;t think this is GNA be as bad (27:38 - 27:43)
as that yeah I&#39;m not yeah I don&#39;t think (27:41 - 27:45)
the Nintendo thing will be as bad I (27:43 - 27:47)
think there is a like a cleverness or (27:45 - 27:51)
like a uh a helpfulness at its core like (27:47 - 27:52)
I don&#39;t think this is like inherently (27:51 - 27:56)
like an evil product or like the like (27:52 - 27:58)
designed to make you hate Mario music (27:56 - 28:01)
waking up I think like no I just think (27:58 - 28:02)
that it (28:01 - 28:06)
will I think it&#39;s novel I think visually (28:02 - 28:08)
it looks cool um you don&#39;t need a Subs I (28:06 - 28:09)
know there were some like rumors of like (28:08 - 28:12)
you need a Nintendo subscription to like (28:09 - 28:13)
use you don&#39;t need a Nintendo you need a (28:12 - 28:15)
Nintendo subscription to buy it to (28:13 - 28:16)
prevent scalpers which I think is (28:15 - 28:18)
probably the most clever thing out of (28:16 - 28:20)
like this entire product launch um and (28:18 - 28:21)
it sounds like you&#39;ll need a (28:20 - 28:23)
subscription to update it with new (28:21 - 28:26)
sounds potentially or maybe just an (28:23 - 28:27)
account I think you just need a Nintendo (28:26 - 28:29)
account an account I don&#39;t think you (28:27 - 28:32)
need an online subscription for that um (28:29 - 28:33)
here&#39;s what I&#39;ll say that there are some (28:32 - 28:35)
technical details behind this that maybe (28:33 - 28:38)
people are not missing uh or maybe not (28:35 - 28:40)
aware of so alarmo uses uh millimeter (28:38 - 28:44)
wave sensors in order to sense whether (28:40 - 28:46)
you&#39;re in bed or where you&#39;re out of bed (28:44 - 28:48)
and it&#39;s it&#39;s funny because I think like (28:46 - 28:49)
news articles were like this is meant (28:48 - 28:52)
for single people like which it does say (28:49 - 28:55)
like a partner or a pet can disturb you (28:52 - 28:57)
this technology has already existed and (28:55 - 28:59)
this is this technology specifically (28:57 - 29:00)
this millimeter wave technology is why (28:59 - 29:03)
this alarm clock is so expensive um and (29:00 - 29:06)
why it&#39;s not perfect for everyone so (29:03 - 29:08)
there&#39;s already an alarm clock that has (29:06 - 29:10)
this in that you can go out and buy you (29:08 - 29:11)
could have bought this like four years (29:10 - 29:14)
ago it&#39;s called the Google Nest Hub um (29:11 - 29:18)
it is a little 7inch screen with no (29:14 - 29:20)
camera or anything but it does have the (29:18 - 29:22)
millimeter wave and it will show you the (29:20 - 29:25)
time and when you lay in bed it will use (29:22 - 29:27)
the millimeter wave to then sense you&#39;re (29:25 - 29:30)
in bed and as a sleep tracker it&#39;s (29:27 - 29:33)
incredibly good uh it works really well (29:30 - 29:35)
uh and it&#39;s funny because that&#39;s why I (29:33 - 29:38)
was asking questions about like um your (29:35 - 29:41)
aura ring last week Hannah uh and just (29:38 - 29:44)
like Google fit in general because I I (29:41 - 29:46)
would assume that Pokemon sleep could (29:44 - 29:49)
take the data from the Google Nest Hub (29:46 - 29:51)
because all it&#39;s using is the (29:49 - 29:55)
Google uh Fitness whatever Google Health (29:51 - 29:58)
Google Health app yeah um cuz it&#39;s it&#39;s (29:55 - 30:01)
been Rec my my my sleep has been (29:58 - 30:02)
recorded for the last four years in (30:01 - 30:05)
Google Health have I looked at it no but (30:02 - 30:07)
it&#39;s it&#39;s there and when I wake up in (30:05 - 30:08)
the morning the little Nest tub will (30:07 - 30:10)
show me my sleep if I want to it&#39;ll show (30:08 - 30:12)
me the weather it&#39;ll show pictures of my (30:10 - 30:14)
cats right like it it was like a cool (30:12 - 30:17)
thing for like 140 bucks but the selling (30:14 - 30:19)
point was the millimeter wave sleep (30:17 - 30:22)
which is what alarmo is using this (30:19 - 30:23)
doesn&#39;t work very (30:22 - 30:26)
well in the sense of having two people (30:23 - 30:29)
in your bed because if I get out of bed (30:26 - 30:31)
and if the person s sleeping next to me (30:29 - 30:33)
is just close enough it just assumes (30:31 - 30:35)
that that is me CU it&#39;s not using a (30:33 - 30:39)
camera right um or sometimes it&#39;ll say (30:35 - 30:42)
like you slept from like 1: p.m. to 2 (30:39 - 30:43)
p.m. it was like no that was my cat who (30:42 - 30:46)
was just sleeping on my pillow like or (30:43 - 30:48)
if I put like a a water bottle in front (30:46 - 30:51)
of it that will think that like oh I&#39;m (30:48 - 30:53)
sleeping because it&#39;s Block it&#39;s (30:51 - 30:56)
blocking the sensor in a way where it&#39;s (30:53 - 30:58)
you also like ideally have to have it (30:56 - 31:00)
facing the bed it has to be at like the (30:58 - 31:03)
right height technically because if your (31:00 - 31:05)
nightstand is too short or too high it&#39;s (31:03 - 31:07)
not like reading you so if you&#39;re (31:05 - 31:09)
curious of like why this is $100 it&#39;s (31:07 - 31:12)
because of the millimeter wave stuff um (31:09 - 31:15)
and when it works really well if you (31:12 - 31:18)
don&#39;t have pets or anything else in your (31:15 - 31:20)
bed cuz all it&#39;s looking for is like an (31:18 - 31:23)
object in front of it right and whether (31:20 - 31:25)
that object is moving or not without (31:23 - 31:27)
needing a camera which I think is the (31:25 - 31:29)
right call I don&#39;t think (31:27 - 31:32)
I think most people don&#39;t want a camera (31:29 - 31:34)
on them while they sleep don&#39;t put a (31:32 - 31:36)
camera Nintendo don&#39;t put a camera inom (31:34 - 31:37)
in your alarm clock alarm mod need does (31:36 - 31:40)
not need a (31:37 - 31:42)
camera (31:40 - 31:47)
um so like I I think I think it&#39;s novel (31:42 - 31:48)
I think it&#39;s (31:47 - 31:51)
cool I feel like 20-year-old me would (31:48 - 31:54)
have been first in line to buy this but (31:51 - 31:58)
like 30 however old I am 30 some year (31:54 - 32:02)
old me like I just would never use this (31:58 - 32:05)
product mhm like I (32:02 - 32:07)
like but I&#39;m like the opposite of Hannah (32:05 - 32:09)
Hannah has like four ways to track her (32:07 - 32:11)
sleep (32:09 - 32:14)
I I I I just don&#39;t care like I just I (32:11 - 32:16)
like I know that I slept bad or I know (32:14 - 32:18)
that like I should be going to bed (32:16 - 32:19)
earlier right I don&#39;t need a I don&#39;t (32:18 - 32:21)
need a machine to tell me that I slept (32:19 - 32:23)
bad I can feel it when I wake up (32:21 - 32:26)
sometimes it can help you figure out (32:23 - 32:29)
why and some of them help you wake up at (32:26 - 32:32)
better times that make it so that you&#39;re (32:29 - 32:34)
not yeah that make it easier so you&#39;re (32:32 - 32:36)
not waking up in the middle of a sleep (32:34 - 32:40)
cycle right I I would be like I think (32:36 - 32:42)
the themes is really great it&#39;s crazy to (32:40 - 32:45)
me that alarmo has more themes than the (32:42 - 32:47)
Nintendo switch like that that is that (32:45 - 32:51)
is crazy uh I think adding more games is (32:47 - 32:53)
really cool I think I think this is just (32:51 - 32:56)
a really good like Christmas gift or (32:53 - 32:58)
birthday gift for exactly that&#39;s what (32:56 - 33:00)
it&#39;s four and that&#39;s why it came out now (32:58 - 33:02)
right it&#39;s right before the holiday (33:00 - 33:04)
season if they&#39;re going to sell a bunch (33:02 - 33:06)
of them for the holiday season they (33:04 - 33:08)
don&#39;t have a switch two to give us but (33:06 - 33:10)
they&#39;re going to make some money you (33:08 - 33:11)
know Nintendo&#39;s goingon to make some (33:10 - 33:13)
money during this holiday season with (33:11 - 33:17)
this item so yeah I still think it&#39;s (33:13 - 33:19)
going to make people even if it&#39;s just (33:17 - 33:23)
kids hate their favorite video games (33:19 - 33:27)
yeah I I wonder how quickly that novelty (33:23 - 33:29)
will actually wear off and it will just (33:27 - 33:32)
become like people&#39;s clock that&#39;s just (33:29 - 33:34)
on their bedside stand and not actually (33:32 - 33:36)
use it for the alarm purpos does it have (33:34 - 33:39)
like a non Nintendo alarm like just like (33:36 - 33:43)
a like a bell sound does it have um not (33:39 - 33:46)
that think I think it&#39;s only based on (33:43 - 33:49)
the five themes I guess maybe you said (33:46 - 33:50)
it to the game you don&#39;t play if you (33:49 - 33:52)
were trying to avoid hating okay so this (33:50 - 33:55)
brings up so this brings up uh (33:52 - 33:57)
Splatoon I don&#39;t know if you watched the (33:55 - 33:59)
if you watched the video where they (33:57 - 34:02)
showed the Splatoon one but the sound (33:59 - 34:04)
effect it makes when you move around is (34:02 - 34:08)
the sound of the paintball Cannon going (34:04 - 34:09)
off so if you want to feel like someone (34:08 - 34:12)
is shooting at you with a paintball (34:09 - 34:14)
cannon in the morning then go ahead and (34:12 - 34:16)
turn the Splatoon theme on because I&#39;m (34:14 - 34:18)
sure that&#39;ll wake you up very (34:16 - 34:20)
incentivizing you to stay as still as (34:18 - 34:23)
humanly possible it sounds like a war (34:20 - 34:25)
zone it it&#39;s terrible like I don&#39;t (34:23 - 34:27)
understand why they chose that theme for (34:25 - 34:30)
one of them it sounds awful I would (34:27 - 34:33)
never want to wake up with that theme (34:30 - 34:34)
going (34:33 - 34:38)
off it&#39;s very interesting if you (34:34 - 34:41)
haven&#39;t this alarm clock has made me (34:38 - 34:44)
want to do is redownload Pikmin Bloom (34:41 - 34:45)
because like them showing like the (34:44 - 34:47)
Pikmin and the little noises the Pikmin (34:45 - 34:49)
makes I was like ah I miss I kind of (34:47 - 34:50)
miss Pikmin (34:49 - 34:53)
Bloom um that&#39;s positive noise (34:50 - 34:56)
Association if you get this clock and it (34:53 - 34:57)
goes off and wakes you up with those (34:56 - 34:59)
sounds will never want to download (34:57 - 35:02)
Pikmin bloom again the the the most (34:59 - 35:05)
negative noise Association I have in (35:02 - 35:08)
video games right now is the sounds that (35:05 - 35:13)
Pokemon go make the like battle noise (35:08 - 35:16)
like like I can&#39;t from going to go fast (35:13 - 35:18)
events yeah from go fast events or just (35:16 - 35:21)
people doing like raids without with (35:18 - 35:23)
this the sound turned on I I just it&#39;s (35:21 - 35:26)
been eight years I think the Pokémon go (35:23 - 35:30)
sounds are so ear piercingly (35:26 - 35:32)
bad and just not like the music in (35:30 - 35:34)
Pokemon go I think is fine it&#39;s just (35:32 - 35:36)
like their sound effects that they Ed (35:34 - 35:38)
for like battles or raids or when the (35:36 - 35:41)
game boots up I just oh yeah I so don&#39;t (35:38 - 35:43)
like love the music of Splatoon I think (35:41 - 35:47)
that Splatoon music is like too guitar (35:43 - 35:51)
Rift heavy for me yeah the Pikmin (35:47 - 35:53)
Music (35:51 - 35:56)
Beautiful uh they also have music (35:53 - 35:58)
that&#39;ll help you wind down at night I (35:56 - 36:00)
think that&#39;s cool but the music doesn&#39;t (35:58 - 36:03)
seem at least what they played for it&#39;s (36:00 - 36:05)
you know subjective but it doesn&#39;t it (36:03 - 36:07)
doesn&#39;t sound like music that would wind (36:05 - 36:11)
me down like it that&#39;s not incredibly (36:07 - 36:14)
peaceful so I don&#39;t know I I feel (36:11 - 36:18)
like this will be purchased by a lot of (36:14 - 36:21)
people they will use it as an alarm for (36:18 - 36:25)
like a week and then it will just become (36:21 - 36:29)
a bedside clock I think a ctor item I AG (36:25 - 36:31)
I a million per agree with Hannah I (36:29 - 36:33)
think this is like the thing this is (36:31 - 36:36)
like the pocket Pikachu that you will (36:33 - 36:38)
want in like 20 years not to use it but (36:36 - 36:40)
to be like you have it I remember where (36:38 - 36:44)
this came out I want it yeah I mean the (36:40 - 36:46)
the last thing I will say is I don&#39;t (36:44 - 36:50)
think that like Nintendo saw what (36:46 - 36:52)
Pokemon sleep was doing and was like oh (36:50 - 36:56)
we need to like get in on (36:52 - 36:59)
this like I think that there is a boom (36:56 - 37:01)
in sleep technology in general right now (36:59 - 37:04)
and for good reason mhm and I just want (37:01 - 37:05)
to remind people that Nintendo was the (37:04 - 37:08)
same company that made we fit they (37:05 - 37:10)
literally made a weight balance board to (37:08 - 37:13)
get on for you to do yoga and exercise (37:10 - 37:14)
so like this I don&#39;t think is like (37:13 - 37:16)
unique or shocking of something that (37:14 - 37:19)
Nintendo will do but I I have no proof (37:16 - 37:20)
of this I just want to like bring this (37:19 - 37:24)
up as a talking point um when Pokemon go (37:20 - 37:25)
came (37:24 - 37:30)
out people the the Nintendo stock price (37:25 - 37:32)
shot up really high right when I don&#39;t (37:30 - 37:33)
know if you guys remember this when (37:32 - 37:35)
Pokemon go came out and Pokemon and (37:33 - 37:37)
Nintendo sorry Nintendo had to come out (37:35 - 37:40)
to investors and to this the public and (37:37 - 37:44)
be like we have nothing to do with (37:40 - 37:48)
Pokemon go H like like just a heads up (37:44 - 37:50)
like thank you for buying our stock but (37:48 - 37:51)
we don&#39;t have anything to do with (37:50 - 37:52)
Pokemon go and the reason I&#39;m saying (37:51 - 37:55)
this is because obviously Nintendo owns (37:52 - 37:58)
onethird or some portion of the Pokemon (37:55 - 38:02)
company so I think that I think that is (37:58 - 38:04)
probably very comparable to Pokemon (38:02 - 38:06)
sleep like just because Nintendo has an (38:04 - 38:08)
investment in the Pokemon company (38:06 - 38:10)
doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re involved in (38:08 - 38:12)
Pokemon sleep and I I realistically (38:10 - 38:14)
don&#39;t think (38:12 - 38:17)
like this will have like Pokemon sleep (38:14 - 38:20)
integration uh it would be cool if it (38:17 - 38:23)
did I feel like it could though based on (38:20 - 38:25)
record it could because it would they (38:23 - 38:29)
would use the millimeter wave just like (38:25 - 38:32)
would um it definitely could but I don&#39;t (38:29 - 38:35)
feel like it will yes just like I don&#39;t (38:32 - 38:37)
think the switch will ever get more (38:35 - 38:41)
themes I don&#39;t think at this (38:37 - 38:44)
point does the I missed this in the (38:41 - 38:47)
article does the does alarmo have (38:44 - 38:50)
bluetooth not that I know of no so then (38:47 - 38:52)
on the official (38:50 - 38:56)
Nintendo site it&#39;s it it says like uh (38:52 - 38:57)
button dial notification button back (38:56 - 39:00)
button button 2.8 in screen brightness (38:57 - 39:02)
sensor and then motion sensor the motion (39:00 - 39:05)
sensor is the the millimeter wave (39:02 - 39:07)
technology so if it doesn&#39;t have (39:05 - 39:09)
Bluetooth then there isn&#39;t a way for it (39:07 - 39:12)
to yeah it would have to send it to (39:09 - 39:16)
either Apple homekit or Google sorry not (39:12 - 39:19)
homekit Apple health or Google Health (39:16 - 39:22)
yeah and there no mention of that (39:19 - 39:25)
either yeah yeah I don&#39;t know maybe it (39:22 - 39:28)
just can&#39;t (39:25 - 39:30)
the Sleep data is just appearing on the (39:28 - 39:32)
device right like it&#39;s not appearing in (39:30 - 39:34)
like an app no yeah you can look at the (39:32 - 39:36)
screen you can turn it on you can go (39:34 - 39:38)
into it on the screen and then you can (39:36 - 39:41)
see the history of uh I believe it&#39;s (39:38 - 39:44)
like it&#39;s called movement data but it (39:41 - 39:46)
does show so it shows your movement data (39:44 - 39:48)
throughout the time you were sleeping (39:46 - 39:49)
yeah that&#39;s the same as the the Google (39:48 - 39:51)
Nest Hub it&#39;s (39:49 - 39:54)
just and not being able to download that (39:51 - 39:56)
in one way or another takes out an (39:54 - 39:58)
entire subsection of audience of people (39:56 - 40:00)
who might use it otherwise which is very (39:58 - 40:03)
interesting well it does have the Wii (40:00 - 40:06)
and you do connect your Nintendo account (40:03 - 40:07)
so at some point they probably could (40:06 - 40:08)
have it set up to where it could send it (40:07 - 40:10)
to that to your Nintendo account so you (40:08 - 40:13)
could see it on your Nintendo account (40:10 - 40:15)
but if it doesn&#39;t have Bluetooth (40:13 - 40:17)
though it&#39;s most likely not going to be (40:15 - 40:21)
able to at least on its own sync to (40:17 - 40:24)
Pokemon sleep so yeah I think that would (40:21 - 40:28)
be not happening but it be cool if it (40:24 - 40:31)
did I mean just another way to uh get (40:28 - 40:34)
that data in sleep would be would be (40:31 - 40:36)
cool but I (40:34 - 40:39)
think the other inconvenience here or (40:36 - 40:42)
the other negative about this is there&#39;s (40:39 - 40:45)
no battery (40:42 - 40:48)
backup which like I think that&#39;s why so (40:45 - 40:50)
many people rely on their phones as an (40:48 - 40:52)
alarm clock because if your power goes (40:50 - 40:54)
out in the middle of the (40:52 - 40:56)
night ideally as long as your phone is (40:54 - 40:58)
charged it will still wake you up when (40:56 - 41:02)
you asked it to wake you up M mhm yeah (40:58 - 41:05)
this device is just USBC connected to (41:02 - 41:07)
the wall I guess you could connect it to (41:05 - 41:11)
a battery Bank um but that&#39;s totally on (41:07 - 41:14)
you sure yeah I think I&#39;m going to lose (41:11 - 41:16)
power tonight let me plug plug this into (41:14 - 41:20)
it yeah no I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a novelty (41:16 - 41:22)
item it will be a collector&#39;s item to (41:20 - 41:24)
some extent like you said it will again (41:22 - 41:28)
I really think the alarm usage will drop (41:24 - 41:30)
dramatically after a few weeks with this (41:28 - 41:33)
thing and it will sure (41:30 - 41:35)
possible to set it otherwise I don&#39;t (41:33 - 41:37)
know how much use there there&#39;s no way (41:35 - 41:38)
you can&#39;t just have it be a clock and (41:37 - 41:41)
just turn the alarm off on it what is it (41:38 - 41:43)
fby you have to like hide it in your (41:41 - 41:45)
dresser drawer after you bought it so (41:43 - 41:47)
that it doesn&#39;t Okay so last last (41:45 - 41:50)
question before we take a break what (41:47 - 41:54)
other Nintendo games would be coming to (41:50 - 41:58)
this hopefully not Pokemon (41:54 - 41:59)
if it&#39;s going to give people negative (41:58 - 42:02)
associations hopefully not Pokemon I (41:59 - 42:04)
feel like if Pokemon comes to it I feel (42:02 - 42:07)
obligated to buy it at that (42:04 - 42:07)
point uh let&#39;s see what else could so (42:08 - 42:12)
they&#39;ve got they already showed off that (42:10 - 42:14)
they&#39;ve got Mario Kart 8 and Animal (42:12 - 42:17)
Crossing coming oh really I didn&#39;t see (42:14 - 42:19)
that yeah that&#39;s what they showed to say (42:17 - 42:20)
like if you hook it up to your Nintendo (42:19 - 42:23)
account it those are the first two that (42:20 - 42:24)
they were showing will be coming as (42:23 - 42:26)
updates yeah Animal Crossing is probably (42:24 - 42:29)
going to have the best sounds probably (42:26 - 42:31)
yeah that I heard the ringfit actually (42:29 - 42:33)
has like the best sounds right now how (42:31 - 42:35)
many people are setting it to ringfit (42:33 - 42:37)
unsure (42:35 - 42:39)
but I would assume (42:37 - 42:44)
Kirby yeah see Kirby Super (42:39 - 42:46)
Smash I don&#39;t know about smash but maybe (42:44 - 42:49)
something Yoshi (42:46 - 42:49)
related yeah Yoshi related to be (42:50 - 42:57)
something um uh me Metroid maybe just (42:52 - 42:59)
going through classic the (42:57 - 43:02)
classics what&#39; you say Mario Kart yeah (42:59 - 43:05)
that&#39;s that is coming Mario Mario Kart (43:02 - 43:06)
yeah that&#39;s the other one I was focusing (43:05 - 43:09)
on Animal Crossing (43:06 - 43:11)
uh I think Kirby would be guaranteed for (43:09 - 43:15)
sure I think Pokemon will come like if (43:11 - 43:19)
if alarmo is still popular to any extent (43:15 - 43:23)
in like a year it won&#39;t be Legends Za (43:19 - 43:28)
theme coming to alarmo I mean can we (43:23 - 43:31)
just back up for a second it&#39;s got a (43:28 - 43:34)
name alarmo is great fact that it&#39;s (43:31 - 43:37)
called alarmo is amazing in (43:34 - 43:40)
itself it&#39;s a pretty good name it (43:37 - 43:44)
is uh yeah I don&#39;t know I mean I I don&#39;t (43:40 - 43:45)
think there will (43:44 - 43:47)
be I can&#39;t imagine there will be that (43:45 - 43:49)
many themes coming like I don&#39;t think (43:47 - 43:51)
there&#39;s gonna like in in two years from (43:49 - 43:53)
now we have like (43:51 - 43:55)
75 yeah no I I think I think like maybe (43:53 - 43:57)
after the first like Animal Crossing in (43:55 - 43:59)
in Mario Kart there probably like three (43:57 - 44:01)
more themes and then they&#39;re done like (43:59 - 44:04)
yeah yeah I I I like this product (44:01 - 44:07)
screams like let&#39;s put something up for (44:04 - 44:10)
Christmas all right we&#39;re done with (44:07 - 44:15)
it 100% yep all right uh let&#39;s take a (44:10 - 44:16)
quick break when when we come back we (44:15 - 44:18)
got some more Pokemon sports related (44:16 - 44:20)
stuff (44:18 - 44:23)
I this keeps Bobby we&#39;re relying on you (44:20 - 44:25)
here yeah a lot of lot of heavy lifting (44:23 - 44:28)
on Bobby we&#39;ll be we&#39;ll be right (44:25 - 44:32)
back and we are back from our break I (44:28 - 44:34)
think it was like two weeks ago we (44:32 - 44:35)
talked (44:34 - 44:39)
about Pokemon being at a baseball game (44:35 - 44:41)
and how you could get there was actually (44:39 - 44:43)
two baseball games I think we talked (44:41 - 44:46)
about one yeah but yeah you could get (44:43 - 44:48)
like a Pikachu with a background of the (44:46 - 44:51)
stadium and then they had raids and you (44:48 - 44:55)
get like a shirt it&#39;s very cool mhm uh (44:51 - 44:58)
they did another event this one was for (44:55 - 45:01)
basketball uh it was at the climate (44:58 - 45:03)
pledge (45:01 - 45:05)
Arena and it was the Trailblazers versus (45:03 - 45:08)
the Clippers this is off their actual (45:05 - 45:11)
website the LA Clippers will host the (45:08 - 45:13)
Portland Trailblazers in Seattle as part (45:11 - 45:17)
of the 2024 to 2025 pre-season for the (45:13 - 45:19)
Rain City showcase presented by the (45:17 - 45:21)
Pokemon company International this is (45:19 - 45:24)
the third straight preseason that the (45:21 - 45:27)
Clippers will host a game in Seattle (45:24 - 45:29)
which is confusing to me I don&#39;t (45:27 - 45:31)
understand how that works as a not (45:29 - 45:34)
Sports person why are two teams neither (45:31 - 45:36)
of whom are Seattle (45:34 - 45:38)
teams I was going to say battling that&#39;s (45:36 - 45:40)
not how Sports work (45:38 - 45:43)
competing (45:40 - 45:47)
battling a stadium in a location that (45:43 - 45:51)
that is not Los Angeles yeah that (45:47 - 45:54)
happens uh with exhibition games uh they (45:51 - 45:57)
will play games in places that are not (45:54 - 46:01)
specifically one of their um places for (45:57 - 46:03)
instance like the Lakers used to play at (46:01 - 46:05)
least one exhibition game down here in (46:03 - 46:08)
San Diego which is closer obviously but (46:05 - 46:11)
there would be a Lakers game um at our (46:08 - 46:13)
Sports Arena here in San Diego from time (46:11 - 46:17)
to time uh I&#39;m not sure why they&#39;re (46:13 - 46:19)
choosing that why they choose chose (46:17 - 46:22)
Seattle um I don&#39;t know if one of them (46:19 - 46:25)
has a um like a essentially like a minor (46:22 - 46:27)
league team uh that maybe plays in (46:25 - 46:29)
Seattle I could see maybe if maybe (46:27 - 46:32)
Portland does I&#39;m not sure but yeah they (46:29 - 46:35)
do play I mean in football they&#39;re (46:32 - 46:38)
they&#39;re play games in London now so like (46:35 - 46:40)
you know they play places that the teams (46:38 - 46:43)
are not from Germany and yeah um I mean (46:40 - 46:44)
I I mean like American football they (46:43 - 46:47)
play games in London yes they have done (46:44 - 46:49)
in Germany recently too yeah so it&#39;s (46:47 - 46:51)
weird yeah they play games in places (46:49 - 46:53)
that they aren&#39;t (46:51 - 46:56)
from does it have to do with like just (46:53 - 46:59)
sponsors in General (46:56 - 47:01)
like is it because the Pokemon company (46:59 - 47:03)
ultimately (47:01 - 47:07)
sponsored this venue that it sounded (47:03 - 47:09)
like more of a repetitive thing than (47:07 - 47:13)
just this one Pokemon mhm one yeah it&#39;s (47:09 - 47:14)
this is the third year now that they&#39;ve (47:13 - 47:17)
done this oh these two specific (47:14 - 47:20)
teams uh or at least the LA team yeah (47:17 - 47:22)
the Clippers are the ones that host it I (47:20 - 47:24)
don&#39;t know they might not be playing the (47:22 - 47:25)
the Trailblazers every every year when (47:24 - 47:28)
they do this could be different yeah I (47:25 - 47:29)
guess I don&#39;t know the behind the scenes (47:28 - 47:30)
of (47:29 - 47:33)
sports uh I do have this off poke Beach (47:30 - 47:36)
it said that every attendant received a (47:33 - 47:38)
stamped Pikachu promo card inside a (47:36 - 47:41)
Terra Charizard sleeve exclusive (47:38 - 47:44)
merchandise was also sold at the events (47:41 - 47:50)
uh so they you could get a hat a pin and (47:44 - 47:52)
a sticker it looks like and then the (47:50 - 47:56)
Rain City showcase is a yearly NBA event (47:52 - 47:58)
the only opportunity to get this promo (47:56 - 48:00)
last night strangely the Pokemon company (47:58 - 48:03)
International did not advertise the (48:00 - 48:05)
event on their socials ahead of time no (48:03 - 48:07)
press releases were sent out they only (48:05 - 48:09)
advertised it locally in Seattle this is (48:07 - 48:11)
the first time the Pokemon company has (48:09 - 48:14)
sponsored a sporting event in the United (48:11 - 48:16)
States what do (48:14 - 48:19)
you the Pokemon company Internationals (48:16 - 48:21)
UK Branch previously partnered with an (48:19 - 48:23)
England Football Association to promote (48:21 - 48:26)
the youth f f fol as a part of a (48:23 - 48:28)
collaboration between the Pokemon (48:26 - 48:29)
company International released five (48:28 - 48:31)
promos that that was like the the soccer (48:29 - 48:33)
for the American people listening that (48:31 - 48:38)
was the five soccer promo cards (48:33 - 48:38)
um I I guess I&#39;m I&#39;m trusting that poke (48:38 - 48:43)
Beach is accurate in saying this is the (48:41 - 48:45)
first time the Pokemon company (48:43 - 48:46)
International has sponsored a sporting (48:45 - 48:48)
event in the United States because I (48:46 - 48:51)
don&#39;t think the baseball stuff was (48:48 - 48:53)
specifically (48:51 - 48:57)
sponsored correct wasn&#39;t it was it even (48:53 - 48:59)
sponsored (48:57 - 49:02)
by Niantic or anything or was it (48:59 - 49:05)
just like a (49:02 - 49:07)
collaboration yeah I don&#39;t know like (49:05 - 49:09)
what how are we defining sponsors right (49:07 - 49:11)
I&#39;m not sure like how how they&#39;re (49:09 - 49:15)
defining that uh I mean it does say it&#39;s (49:11 - 49:19)
presented by Pokemon um yeah so I saw I (49:15 - 49:21)
saw a screenshot of like every single (49:19 - 49:23)
seat had one of those Pikachu hats that (49:21 - 49:25)
you would get at like a Pokemon show (49:23 - 49:27)
like the entire state (49:25 - 49:31)
every seat had a Pikachu hat on it um (49:27 - 49:35)
whereas like the baseball stuff (49:31 - 49:38)
the it was just like a small or like a a (49:35 - 49:41)
roped off area of the stadium was where (49:38 - 49:43)
like the Pokemon tickets were being sold (49:41 - 49:47)
as well so two things typically for for (49:43 - 49:53)
one um basketball Arenas have a much (49:47 - 49:56)
smaller space typically so like you&#39;re (49:53 - 49:57)
going to see you&#39;re typically going to (49:56 - 49:59)
see less fans showing up to a basketball (49:57 - 50:01)
game than you are a baseball or a (49:59 - 50:04)
football game uh second unless you&#39;re (50:01 - 50:09)
the Chargers uh second you&#39;re going uh (50:04 - 50:11)
the way that the baseball games work is (50:09 - 50:14)
typically like they hand out the the (50:11 - 50:17)
free item upon entry or in the case of (50:14 - 50:19)
that of the games that they had this at (50:17 - 50:21)
a while back they were you would go to (50:19 - 50:23)
one specific area and go pick up the (50:21 - 50:26)
items um I don&#39;t know if in basketball (50:23 - 50:28)
games it&#39;s typically done that way or if (50:26 - 50:30)
it is typically done where they just (50:28 - 50:32)
like set the item on a seat because the (50:30 - 50:34)
people still received the card as they (50:32 - 50:37)
walked in right the cards weren&#39;t on the (50:34 - 50:40)
no just the Hat on the seat yeah so but (50:37 - 50:42)
they knew that people would TR probably (50:40 - 50:43)
try and grab the cards from the other (50:42 - 50:46)
seats nearby yeah that definitely would (50:43 - 50:49)
have happened because uh as soon as I (50:46 - 50:52)
saw this I went to eBay because I wanted (50:49 - 50:54)
to see like well how much is this promo (50:52 - 50:57)
card today and it does look like there (50:54 - 51:00)
are many that have a lot of bids on them (50:57 - 51:02)
around hovering around $50 or (51:00 - 51:06)
$60 and then a lot of buy it Nows are (51:02 - 51:10)
around 90 for this card this free card (51:06 - 51:12)
well don&#39;t worry somebody is trying to (51:10 - 51:14)
sell a Pokemon Pikachu Rain City (51:12 - 51:18)
showcase exclusive hat rare for $20 I (51:14 - 51:21)
got news for that person that is the (51:18 - 51:22)
same hat they&#39;ve been giving out for (51:21 - 51:25)
free at every Pokemon go event for eight (51:22 - 51:28)
years MH there ain&#39;t nothing exclusive (51:25 - 51:29)
about that Rain City Pikachu hat you&#39;re (51:28 - 51:32)
trying to sell yeah but the card is cool (51:29 - 51:34)
the little Pikachu promo card with the (51:32 - 51:37)
little rain City stamp is cool I can&#39;t (51:34 - 51:41)
tell it does look like it is yeah it&#39;s a (51:37 - 51:44)
it is a Pikachu card from I believe Pala (51:41 - 51:46)
evolved I think it&#39;s the Pikachu from (51:44 - 51:48)
that set it just has a Rain City (51:46 - 51:53)
showcase stamp on it so that&#39;s cool but (51:48 - 51:55)
yeah if you want it now it&#39;s somewhere (51:53 - 51:59)
between $60 and $90 (51:55 - 51:59)
online really not that bad (51:59 - 52:05)
for how many how much does a baseball St (52:02 - 52:08)
or a basketball stadium hold this (52:05 - 52:10)
probably I don&#39;t know where this was I (52:08 - 52:11)
would say it&#39;s under (52:10 - 52:15)
20,000 so somewhere probably between 15 (52:11 - 52:19)
18,000 seats typically in a basketball (52:15 - 52:22)
arena uh although I don&#39;t know where I (52:19 - 52:24)
got I don&#39;t know where this was held cuz (52:22 - 52:26)
I don&#39;t know what basket like what teams (52:24 - 52:28)
would typically be typically be playing (52:26 - 52:31)
at this Arena because (52:28 - 52:33)
Seattle do SE I don&#39;t know if Seattle (52:31 - 52:34)
has an NBA team I know they I know they (52:33 - 52:36)
didn&#39;t for many years and I don&#39;t know (52:34 - 52:37)
if they ever came back and brought a (52:36 - 52:39)
Seattle Team back I don&#39;t think they (52:37 - 52:41)
have yet I guess that would answer our (52:39 - 52:44)
question of why the two teams there I (52:41 - 52:46)
mean there there are other right like (52:44 - 52:48)
colleges that play in arenas and things (52:46 - 52:50)
like that so I mean I just don&#39;t think (52:48 - 52:52)
there&#39;s a there&#39;s not an NBA team in (52:50 - 52:53)
Seattle right (52:52 - 52:58)
now okay so (52:53 - 52:59)
hey you build those stadiums you got to (52:58 - 53:01)
fill it with (52:59 - 53:01)
something (53:03 - 53:08)
true (53:05 - 53:08)
yeah I you know as as as as not a sports (53:08 - 53:16)
person I think this stuff is so (53:13 - 53:20)
cool I wish they had announced it any at (53:16 - 53:22)
all I mean it&#39;s kind of cool for it to (53:20 - 53:25)
have happened but I only learned about (53:22 - 53:28)
it after it had already happened mhm (53:25 - 53:31)
yeah y i I don&#39;t (53:28 - 53:34)
know but Hannah you famously said no (53:31 - 53:35)
that you did not want to go to the (53:34 - 53:39)
baseball game yeah no I I do live in the (53:35 - 53:41)
Pacific Northwest I wouldn&#39;t have gone (53:39 - 53:43)
to the baseball game probably and I (53:41 - 53:44)
would have been even less likely to go (53:43 - 53:48)
to this right now at some point in time (53:44 - 53:50)
maybe but not right (53:48 - 53:53)
now well basketball game oh this could (53:50 - 53:55)
cause controversy but basketball games (53:53 - 53:57)
are more fun than baseball games in my (53:55 - 54:00)
opinion that is a subject that is that (53:57 - 54:02)
is an (54:00 - 54:04)
opinion my family would not even if (54:02 - 54:06)
there was a Pokemon go thing even if (54:04 - 54:08)
this had been announced ahead of time my (54:06 - 54:09)
family went to the B baseball game and (54:08 - 54:11)
would not have gone to the basketball (54:09 - 54:15)
game yeah there was a Pokemon go tiin I (54:11 - 54:17)
guess here uh it was not a background (54:15 - 54:19)
which was a little unfortunate like the (54:17 - 54:21)
baseball they did they they did bring (54:19 - 54:24)
back party hat Pikachu so party hat (54:21 - 54:28)
Pikachu was spawning at the event which (54:24 - 54:30)
isn&#39;t like that exciting but I think (54:28 - 54:31)
it&#39;s not but it is really cool to see (54:30 - 54:34)
them bring back kind of one little (54:31 - 54:36)
special thing and tie in all these (54:34 - 54:38)
different Pokemon Elements together I (54:36 - 54:40)
like that there was both a card special (54:38 - 54:42)
for the thing and a special Pokémon go (54:40 - 54:45)
thing happening that&#39;s really kind of (54:42 - 54:47)
surprising they don&#39;t do that for very (54:45 - 54:50)
many events well I guess when the (54:47 - 54:53)
Pokemon company is sponsoring it they (54:50 - 54:57)
can go to and you know they can but that (54:53 - 54:59)
doesn&#39;t mean they will yeah I mean I&#39;m a (54:57 - 55:02)
little bummed there was no Pokemon (54:59 - 55:06)
sleep uh if you nap at the game you get (55:02 - 55:09)
a special special have Pikachu we ate PR (55:06 - 55:12)
scrubb and spots if you sleep through (55:09 - 55:14)
this basketball game H I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve (55:12 - 55:16)
never been to a basketball game I&#39;ve (55:14 - 55:17)
been to a baseball (55:16 - 55:21)
game been to a soccer (55:17 - 55:21)
game never I&#39;ve never been to a football (55:22 - 55:27)
game either really unless you think like (55:25 - 55:29)
high school football but that&#39;s like (55:27 - 55:34)
it&#39;s different yeah very different yeah (55:29 - 55:37)
uh I&#39;ve been to baseball games growing (55:34 - 55:38)
up because my family is big into (55:37 - 55:42)
baseball but I think that&#39;s it I played (55:38 - 55:44)
wrestling and track and field and (55:42 - 55:48)
Jiu-Jitsu and fencing but uh none of (55:44 - 55:50)
those that&#39;s all School (55:48 - 55:55)
sports yeah uh I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been to (55:50 - 55:58)
the main four right so baseball (55:55 - 56:00)
basketball (55:58 - 56:04)
soccer and hockey baseball basketball oh (56:00 - 56:06)
sorry baseball basketball football and (56:04 - 56:08)
hockey hockey is the most fun in my (56:06 - 56:10)
opinion honestly like I&#39;m not even a (56:08 - 56:12)
huge hockey fan they are hockey cold (56:10 - 56:15)
though I mean you wear a sweater I don&#39;t (56:12 - 56:16)
know you&#39;re always wearing hoodies (56:15 - 56:19)
anyway that&#39;s true that&#39;s true I&#39;m well (56:16 - 56:22)
prepared for a hockey game but they are (56:19 - 56:27)
very fun uh games to watch in person and (56:22 - 56:28)
once you start like once you understand (56:27 - 56:30)
like what&#39;s going (56:28 - 56:33)
on they are uh I would say and I&#39;m a and (56:30 - 56:35)
I&#39;m a I&#39;m a I grew up as a very big (56:33 - 56:37)
basketball fan so I was a huge NBA fan (56:35 - 56:40)
growing up but I think hockey games are (56:37 - 56:43)
like the most fun I&#39;ve had like actually (56:40 - 56:45)
at a game watching it live like going to (56:43 - 56:48)
a hockey game made me actually (56:45 - 56:51)
enjoy watching hockey on TV more after (56:48 - 56:53)
actually I believe that I have I&#39;ve (56:51 - 56:55)
taken people (56:53 - 56:59)
to like wrestling shows and they they (56:55 - 57:00)
walk out being like holy cow that was (56:59 - 57:03)
like so fun yeah I feel like for almost (57:00 - 57:05)
any sport once you experience some of (57:03 - 57:09)
the hype and camaraderie and excitement (57:05 - 57:12)
of a game as long as nothing goes (57:09 - 57:15)
terribly wrong um you come out liking (57:12 - 57:17)
the sport at least a little bit more (57:15 - 57:20)
yeah it again this is an opinion but (57:17 - 57:22)
like I will say like there are games (57:20 - 57:24)
though that so like baseball for (57:22 - 57:27)
instance it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a slow paced (57:24 - 57:30)
game in the same way that like hockey or (57:27 - 57:32)
like basketball or soccer where that (57:30 - 57:34)
you&#39;re constantly moving right even even (57:32 - 57:36)
foot like American football is slower (57:34 - 57:38)
paced in that it stops every play so (57:36 - 57:40)
every play you have like 30 or 40 (57:38 - 57:41)
seconds where people are they&#39;re setting (57:40 - 57:43)
up they&#39;re changing they&#39;re figuring out (57:41 - 57:47)
to play in basketball hockey and soccer (57:43 - 57:49)
it&#39;s just constant movement (57:47 - 57:51)
for depending on the sport the amount of (57:49 - 57:53)
time right in hockey it&#39;s 20 minutes a (57:51 - 57:54)
period basketball it&#39;s 12 minutes a (57:53 - 57:56)
quarter and soccer it&#39;s 45 minutes a (57:54 - 57:59)
half right so it&#39;s constant movement (57:56 - 58:01)
throughout time (57:59 - 58:04)
and there&#39;s just there&#39;s less time to (58:01 - 58:07)
like not be watching it I guess with (58:04 - 58:08)
those because there&#39;s constant stuff (58:07 - 58:11)
happening all the time (58:08 - 58:13)
so I guess some people could find that (58:11 - 58:15)
like tiring I don&#39;t know I find it more (58:13 - 58:18)
fun to watch those games where there is (58:15 - 58:20)
more happening throughout the time (58:18 - 58:23)
you&#39;re (58:20 - 58:23)
there yeah I I just like the the (58:23 - 58:32)
concept of Pokemon being integrated (58:28 - 58:35)
with other things like again I said I&#39;m (58:32 - 58:37)
not like a a sports fan and I don&#39;t know (58:35 - 58:40)
if like Pokemon being at like a (58:37 - 58:41)
basketball game is enough to convince me (58:40 - 58:43)
but I still think it&#39;s cool right like I (58:41 - 58:46)
still think like wow that was a cool (58:43 - 58:47)
thing they did I hope the people who did (58:46 - 58:50)
go to that event have a good time or (58:47 - 58:52)
like maybe somebody went who wasn&#39;t into (58:50 - 58:54)
B basketball like sat down and was like (58:52 - 58:55)
wow this is actually really fun now I&#39;m (58:54 - 58:57)
like slightly more into it I think I (58:55 - 59:00)
think those are only like those are like (58:57 - 59:03)
win-win situations in a lot of a lot of (59:00 - 59:06)
regards like it it definitely reminds me (59:03 - 59:09)
of when I when I was in Jakarta and I (59:06 - 59:11)
ran that (59:09 - 59:14)
5K I just was like man I (59:11 - 59:17)
wish this happened (59:14 - 59:20)
more in more places like I think a (59:17 - 59:25)
Pokemon themed 5K is so cool and it (59:20 - 59:27)
would probably encourage people who have (59:25 - 59:31)
maybe never run a 5k like to consider (59:27 - 59:33)
doing that I don&#39;t think we actually (59:31 - 59:36)
talked about at the time how themed was (59:33 - 59:40)
that 5K like were there a lot of were (59:36 - 59:42)
there Pikachu standing around cheering (59:40 - 59:44)
people on where was there like a lot of (59:42 - 59:47)
decorations throughout the run or (59:44 - 59:52)
um there uh yeah so the the the entrance (59:47 - 59:54)
was was very themed and decked out and (59:52 - 59:58)
there was uh I missed this because uh my (59:54 - 60:01)
first Uber canceled on me so I was like (59:58 - 60:02)
waiting 10 minutes and then they (60:01 - 60:04)
canceled on me and then I had R the one (60:02 - 60:08)
so I wait 10 minutes um so I missed it (60:04 - 60:10)
but there was like a whole like opening (60:08 - 60:11)
ceremony with like Pikachu warming up (60:10 - 60:13)
and doing stretches so you were supposed (60:11 - 60:15)
to like stretch with Pikachu on stage uh (60:13 - 60:16)
which is like really cool so that was (60:15 - 60:19)
the part I missed and then they had it (60:16 - 60:20)
broken (60:19 - 60:24)
into um like obviously you got like a (60:20 - 60:26)
Pokemon themed shirt you got your (60:24 - 60:28)
running number uh and then when you were (60:26 - 60:30)
done you got your Pikachu metal but it (60:28 - 60:32)
was broken into like two segments so (60:30 - 60:35)
there was a 5K and then there was like a (60:32 - 60:38)
3K and the 3K was meant for like (60:35 - 60:40)
families or kids so they specifically (60:38 - 60:42)
told you that if you were running the 3K (60:40 - 60:45)
to like get to the back because they (60:42 - 60:47)
wanted all the 5K people to like (60:45 - 60:50)
obviously not trample a bunch of like (60:47 - 60:53)
kids yeah good (60:50 - 60:55)
call so organization wise it was set up (60:53 - 60:57)
really well (60:55 - 61:00)
um so I I because I was late uh I got my (60:57 - 61:04)
stuff and then I I was pretty much like (61:00 - 61:07)
the end of the 5K uh like the families (61:04 - 61:09)
just started going (61:07 - 61:11)
through and I don&#39;t know how many people (61:09 - 61:13)
there were there was like that event (61:11 - 61:17)
sold out and disclosure Niantic got me (61:13 - 61:20)
into the event for for free um but I (61:17 - 61:22)
don&#39;t there was a like every 5K you have (61:20 - 61:24)
to pay to enter to get your like to pay (61:22 - 61:26)
for the metal and the clothing or (61:24 - 61:29)
whatever the 5K it came with um but as (61:26 - 61:32)
you ran it they had um like banners of (61:29 - 61:34)
like Pikachu and then there were a bunch (61:32 - 61:36)
of photo opportunities they had a bunch (61:34 - 61:38)
of like big I don&#39;t want to say (61:36 - 61:40)
cardboard because they were like much (61:38 - 61:41)
thicker than that but they had a bunch (61:40 - 61:44)
of like standies of like photo (61:41 - 61:45)
opportunities and then they had like (61:44 - 61:48)
little obstacles like one of them was (61:45 - 61:51)
like a little like almost like a rock (61:48 - 61:53)
climbing wall like not not even that big (61:51 - 61:54)
like something you could easily like (61:53 - 61:56)
take as an adult take like two or three (61:54 - 61:59)
steps over and be like I climbed it uh (61:56 - 62:00)
but I can&#39;t but they paired every (61:59 - 62:03)
obstacle with like a Pokemon so I can&#39;t (62:00 - 62:04)
it was like Geodude or something for (62:03 - 62:06)
like the rock climbing and then there (62:04 - 62:09)
was like there was like a it looked like (62:06 - 62:11)
a like a little car wash like pool (62:09 - 62:13)
noodles hanging from the sky that you (62:11 - 62:15)
could like run through and then there (62:13 - 62:18)
was um like something you like Army (62:15 - 62:20)
crawled through these were all optional (62:18 - 62:22)
and I think mostly to keep like a (62:20 - 62:24)
younger audience engaged like oh we&#39;re (62:22 - 62:28)
coming up to the next obstacle (62:24 - 62:29)
in terms of how Pokemon themed it was (62:28 - 62:32)
yall everybody had Pokemon shirts on (62:29 - 62:35)
right yeah yeah yeah it had quack waval (62:32 - 62:37)
skele dge and moscara on the (62:35 - 62:40)
shirts uh which which I in itself when (62:37 - 62:42)
you think about is really cool because (62:40 - 62:45)
you would think something as like a 5k (62:42 - 62:46)
they would be like just put the (62:45 - 62:48)
Charizard on it just put the (62:46 - 62:51)
blast yeah if that I mean I&#39;ve run races (62:48 - 62:53)
where they just give you a BB having a (62:51 - 62:54)
shirt (62:53 - 62:58)
is I don&#39;t know extra themed yeah yeah (62:54 - 63:00)
um yeah they had a bunch of photo (62:58 - 63:02)
opportunities they had uh they had like (63:00 - 63:04)
people I&#39;m I&#39;m sure all 5Ks have this (63:02 - 63:05)
where they have people being like you&#39;re (63:04 - 63:09)
doing great good job like keep going um (63:05 - 63:11)
they had like uh two water (63:09 - 63:15)
stations and then they near the end they (63:11 - 63:17)
had uh like a sprinkler system you could (63:15 - 63:18)
run through I think that was like a 4K (63:17 - 63:21)
Mark um and I was running with my stream (63:18 - 63:22)
backpack so I was like I want to do this (63:21 - 63:25)
so bad but I cannot get this backpack (63:22 - 63:28)
wet uh and then at the very end they had (63:25 - 63:31)
like a a huge bubble machine um that was (63:28 - 63:34)
like foaming bubbles everywhere and then (63:31 - 63:36)
you got like a banana you got the metal (63:34 - 63:40)
and then it was like lined with a bunch (63:36 - 63:43)
of uh Merchants that were selling like (63:40 - 63:48)
energy drinks or fruit drinks or Boba or (63:43 - 63:50)
um there was a lot that were selling (63:48 - 63:52)
like the Pokemon themed items that were (63:50 - 63:54)
just available in Indonesia you know (63:52 - 63:56)
like (63:54 - 63:59)
they put Pikachu on a bag of chips so (63:56 - 64:00)
they&#39;re like selling the bag of chips (63:59 - 64:03)
with Pikachu on it which is like pretty (64:00 - 64:07)
clever uh so I don&#39;t know how themed (64:03 - 64:08)
that is compared to other runs because (64:07 - 64:11)
I&#39;ve I&#39;ve only done like two other 5Ks (64:08 - 64:13)
before but like when I think of a themed (64:11 - 64:15)
run I think of like a Disney 5K which I (64:13 - 64:17)
know Disney does a lot of themed runs (64:15 - 64:19)
but I don&#39;t I know you&#39;re running in (64:17 - 64:21)
like the Disney park but I don&#39;t know (64:19 - 64:24)
how like maybe that&#39;s just the theme of (64:21 - 64:26)
it as you&#39;re running the Disney I feel (64:24 - 64:28)
like a lot of people dress up for that I (64:26 - 64:30)
could be wrong but I think people do (64:28 - 64:32)
kind of like cosplay (64:30 - 64:35)
costumes but don&#39;t believe they call it (64:32 - 64:37)
cosplay I think they call it what what (64:35 - 64:41)
do they call it disne bounding bounding (64:37 - 64:43)
yeah Disney (64:41 - 64:45)
bounding that sounds right this the (64:43 - 64:48)
Pokemon run sounded pretty pretty themed (64:45 - 64:51)
for a run especially you have the shirt (64:48 - 64:52)
you have the people cheering you on you (64:51 - 64:54)
have all of the obstacles throughout and (64:52 - 64:57)
then you got a Pokemon metal at the end (64:54 - 65:00)
too yeah and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a hefty metal (64:57 - 65:04)
that&#39;s cool it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very Hefty uh (65:00 - 65:07)
yeah and like there were a lot a lot a (65:04 - 65:10)
lot of people stopping every 1K 2K 3K to (65:07 - 65:11)
cuz that&#39;s where they had like the big (65:10 - 65:13)
photo (65:11 - 65:15)
opportunities (65:13 - 65:17)
um so yeah it was it was a really really (65:15 - 65:22)
cool experience I I went to (65:17 - 65:24)
Niantic and I was like you guys should (65:22 - 65:26)
do 5K well obviously niantic&#39;s Georgia (65:24 - 65:31)
to be fair Niantic did not create the 5K (65:26 - 65:33)
right the 5K was put on by the Pokemon (65:31 - 65:37)
company not Niantic but like Niantic was (65:33 - 65:38)
the one that invited me there so they (65:37 - 65:40)
were like you know how&#39;s the weekend (65:38 - 65:41)
like they gave me like the tickets and (65:40 - 65:43)
everything and I was like there should (65:41 - 65:45)
be 5Ks at more Pokemon events and their (65:43 - 65:47)
response to me (65:45 - 65:51)
was they they saved the 5Ks for emerging (65:47 - 65:53)
markets well obviously like Indonesia is (65:51 - 65:57)
an Emerging Market um but they said that (65:53 - 65:59)
it would be too hectic in already (65:57 - 66:00)
established (65:59 - 66:04)
markets and I guess I agree to that like (66:00 - 66:07)
when you think of like the biggest race (66:04 - 66:08)
in the United States I think that&#39;s the (66:07 - 66:12)
Boston Marathon and they only allow like (66:08 - 66:14)
23,000 people to do that and you have to (66:12 - 66:18)
like qualify to get in like you have to (66:14 - 66:20)
run you have to prove that you can like (66:18 - 66:23)
run fast enough to even make it in right (66:20 - 66:24)
and there&#39;s a bunch of people that don&#39;t (66:23 - 66:27)
even make it in um (66:24 - 66:28)
so yeah I I would I would imagine that (66:27 - 66:30)
would be the same issue in the United (66:28 - 66:32)
States or in Japan where it&#39;s like you (66:30 - 66:35)
put up a 5k or 10K and all of a sudden (66:32 - 66:37)
like s sells out or there&#39;s too many (66:35 - 66:38)
people or it&#39;s hard to control (66:37 - 66:40)
especially like in (66:38 - 66:42)
Japan um and that I guess that&#39;s (66:40 - 66:44)
probably why they didn&#39;t advertise the (66:42 - 66:48)
NBA stuff uh because it probably would (66:44 - 66:51)
have been overrun by scalpers or like I (66:48 - 66:53)
I could imagine just because of the (66:51 - 66:57)
world the America we live in today (66:53 - 66:59)
I definitely could imagine people (66:57 - 67:02)
signing up for a 5k just to get the (66:59 - 67:04)
shirt not to run the 5K and then just to (67:02 - 67:07)
put the shirt on eBay but then they (67:04 - 67:10)
wouldn&#39;t have the metal to put on (67:07 - 67:14)
eBay that&#39;s true but you could just walk (67:10 - 67:16)
it and then get the metal and then put (67:14 - 67:19)
that up on eBay I think as far as the (67:16 - 67:21)
basketball game though goes like you&#39;d (67:19 - 67:22)
have to pay to get in the basketball (67:21 - 67:25)
game yeah you pay you go get the card (67:22 - 67:26)
and you leave (67:25 - 67:29)
I know but I don&#39;t you basketball games (67:26 - 67:30)
are cheap so how much is the basketball (67:29 - 67:34)
game I have no clue uh imagine somewhere (67:30 - 67:36)
between 50 and 100 bucks a (67:34 - 67:39)
ticket so if the card&#39;s only worth I (67:36 - 67:41)
mean I don&#39;t think people are going to I (67:39 - 67:43)
just don&#39;t feel like the card should be (67:41 - 67:45)
worth more and just isn&#39;t because nobody (67:43 - 67:48)
knows this event happened or the card is (67:45 - 67:51)
like kind of generic that that too yeah (67:48 - 67:54)
yeah so I was gonna say you know what (67:51 - 67:56)
was cool about the um (67:54 - 67:59)
when they did the little um promotional (67:56 - 68:00)
like the foota (67:59 - 68:02)
promotional uh cards for the for the (68:00 - 68:05)
football ones is that the cards were (68:02 - 68:08)
designed like to be themed around that (68:05 - 68:10)
right and I think it&#39;s always cool when (68:08 - 68:13)
they take characters from like say (68:10 - 68:15)
Pokemon or another you know when I was a (68:13 - 68:18)
kid um they had like a Tiny Tunes uh (68:15 - 68:21)
they had a Tiny Tunes like a sports game (68:18 - 68:22)
and so it was like all the Tiny Tunes (68:21 - 68:24)
characters except that like you play a (68:22 - 68:26)
basketball game with them or bowling or (68:24 - 68:28)
baseball and it&#39;s just fun to see like (68:26 - 68:31)
those characters in a different theme (68:28 - 68:33)
like and like dressed up like in Bas (68:31 - 68:35)
like a baseball uniform or dressed up in (68:33 - 68:37)
a basketball jersey and so it&#39;s cool to (68:35 - 68:39)
see those the football ones where they (68:37 - 68:40)
have all the soccer like they have the (68:39 - 68:42)
soccer ball and they have all the stuff (68:40 - 68:45)
um with them and then this basketball (68:42 - 68:47)
one while cool that it still has the (68:45 - 68:49)
stamp it&#39;s just another card right it&#39;s (68:47 - 68:50)
just a card from Pala evolved with a (68:49 - 68:52)
stamp yeah it would have been cool if it (68:50 - 68:54)
was like Pikachu in like a basketball (68:52 - 68:57)
jersey or like in a basketball arena or (68:54 - 68:58)
something but then the card would also (68:57 - 69:01)
be worth 10 times what it&#39;s what it&#39;s (68:58 - 69:04)
worth today probably so you know you (69:01 - 69:06)
have your your positives and negatives (69:04 - 69:08)
there yeah I (69:06 - 69:11)
I I still think about how cool the (69:08 - 69:13)
Pikachu Indonesia Journey thing was with (69:11 - 69:15)
like the run and the Pokemon go and the (69:13 - 69:19)
concerts and the shopping experience and (69:15 - 69:23)
it was it was very close to like the (69:19 - 69:25)
things you would do at like a world (69:23 - 69:27)
championship ship minus the fact that a (69:25 - 69:29)
giant tournament was going on behind the (69:27 - 69:30)
scenes (69:29 - 69:34)
yeah yeah and minus the fact that it was (69:30 - 69:37)
all spread out in Jakarta but (69:34 - 69:39)
like (69:37 - 69:42)
yeah (69:39 - 69:44)
um I do wonder if we ever get to a point (69:42 - 69:46)
in time (69:44 - 69:49)
where there is like (69:46 - 69:53)
a like a Pokemon like an official (69:49 - 69:55)
Pokemon convention or event that like (69:53 - 69:57)
isn&#39;t (69:55 - 69:59)
worlds I would maybe see them doing a (69:57 - 70:01)
big Pokemon theme park before that (69:59 - 70:03)
happening keeping it all in one place (70:01 - 70:08)
feels easier yeah yeah or just (70:03 - 70:12)
like like I the other solution is (70:08 - 70:16)
like coincide with a big go (70:12 - 70:19)
event where like this weekend is this (70:16 - 70:22)
huge go event but also we have a concert (70:19 - 70:25)
and we have a drone show and we have (70:22 - 70:27)
meet and greets outside this Pokémon go (70:25 - 70:30)
event and we have a run and we have a (70:27 - 70:32)
store because like right now it&#39;s very (70:30 - 70:34)
hit and miss with go events whether like (70:32 - 70:36)
is there even going to be a (70:34 - 70:39)
store like like what&#39;s going to be at (70:36 - 70:41)
the store uh is is is there going to be (70:39 - 70:43)
a drone show is there not is there going (70:41 - 70:45)
to be fire like there like there was no (70:43 - 70:46)
fireworks or anything for New York but (70:45 - 70:49)
there were fireworks for (70:46 - 70:52)
Madrid mhm um or not fireworks but like (70:49 - 70:55)
a huge like light confetti explosion (70:52 - 70:58)
whatever they did for the very different (70:55 - 71:01)
from fireworks (70:58 - 71:01)
yeah (71:02 - 71:07)
um yeah so it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of (71:04 - 71:10)
very hit Miss with Pokemon events (71:07 - 71:12)
but I I do think they&#39;re getting to the (71:10 - 71:14)
point where like expanding them out (71:12 - 71:18)
feels like the natural progression yeah (71:14 - 71:20)
they have a lot of different branches of (71:18 - 71:22)
events and a lot of different branches (71:20 - 71:24)
of games and I feel like they&#39;re (71:22 - 71:26)
starting to maybe tie them together more (71:24 - 71:27)
and more (71:26 - 71:30)
slowly mhm and being able to have events (71:27 - 71:32)
where everything is kind of tied (71:30 - 71:34)
together and there&#39;s a lot of Pokemon (71:32 - 71:36)
stuff going on but it&#39;s not all Pokémon (71:34 - 71:38)
go or (71:36 - 71:39)
all (71:38 - 71:42)
uh anything else that&#39;s ever segregated (71:39 - 71:44)
from the rest of the Pokemon things (71:42 - 71:45)
usually it&#39;s just Pokemon go and then (71:44 - 71:49)
the rest of Pokemon um TCG I would sayg (71:45 - 71:52)
okay a lot of the time yeah but being (71:49 - 71:53)
able to have events that is just kind of (71:52 - 71:57)
all Pokemon stuff it it&#39;s starting to (71:53 - 71:59)
feel like that&#39;s happening more and (71:57 - 72:01)
more (71:59 - 72:04)
yeah uh well speaking of Pokemon go uh (72:01 - 72:07)
we have the Halloween event details so (72:04 - 72:10)
we will take a quick break and then uh (72:07 - 72:12)
we&#39;ll wrap up with Pokemon go and then (72:10 - 72:13)
maybe Halloween stuff for scarlet and (72:12 - 72:17)
violet so we will be right back and we (72:13 - 72:21)
are back from our break Mankey Community (72:17 - 72:22)
Day that has nothing to do with (72:21 - 72:24)
Halloween by the way but the November (72:22 - 72:26)
Community day will be m (72:24 - 72:30)
it&#39;s November right uh which anip is a (72:26 - 72:31)
ghost (72:30 - 72:35)
Pokemon true but it&#39;s November yeah you (72:31 - 72:37)
know they announced it in October it&#39;s a (72:35 - 72:40)
thought that counts uh limited time (72:37 - 72:41)
Evolution requirement you can evolve (72:40 - 72:43)
primape into annihilate after catching (72:41 - 72:46)
20 fighting type Pokemon with primape as (72:43 - 72:49)
your buddy I don&#39;t remember what the (72:46 - 72:52)
requirement was before (72:49 - 72:52)
that 30 is it is it did they just (72:53 - 72:59)
decrease it from 30 to 20 (72:57 - 73:02)
probably uh three times catch XP two (72:59 - 73:06)
times uh catch candy two times XL if (73:02 - 73:08)
you&#39;re level 31 and above uh lure (73:06 - 73:11)
modules 3 hours the normal incense 3 (73:08 - 73:14)
hours surprise snapshot one additional (73:11 - 73:16)
special trade 50% less (73:14 - 73:18)
Stardust it is actually completely (73:16 - 73:20)
different (73:18 - 73:22)
currently uh you have to defeat 30 (73:20 - 73:25)
psychic or Ghost type Pokemon ah yes (73:22 - 73:27)
that makes sense to that sounds like a (73:25 - 73:29)
nightmare it which is why they switched (73:27 - 73:31)
it to what is it did it say catch 20 (73:29 - 73:33)
fighting type Pokemon yes which you&#39;re (73:31 - 73:35)
going to be catching manes so right (73:33 - 73:38)
pretty easy uh primeape will appear in (73:35 - 73:40)
fourstar raids after the event is over (73:38 - 73:44)
so you can then extend that Mankey will (73:40 - 73:45)
be the Showcase we&#39;ll see if that (73:44 - 73:47)
actually happens (73:45 - 73:51)
because the showcases are forever (73:47 - 73:55)
broken was it Slowpoke during the sea (73:51 - 73:58)
waddle yes it was Slowpoke during soad (73:55 - 74:02)
yeah y That&#39;s a (73:58 - 74:05)
mess how many gen one Pokemon have not (74:02 - 74:07)
had a commun day at this point we have (74:05 - 74:09)
to be like like sure this one gets a (74:07 - 74:14)
free pass because it an yes plus I feel (74:09 - 74:16)
like I don&#39;t know as someone who uh (74:14 - 74:18)
fighting type Platinum metal was the (74:16 - 74:21)
last of the type Platinum Metals I got (74:18 - 74:23)
and that was still fairly recently I (74:21 - 74:24)
feel like having a fighting type (74:23 - 74:26)
Community Day is is usually a good thing (74:24 - 74:28)
for a lot of players you got Dragon (74:26 - 74:30)
before fighting I did there have been a (74:28 - 74:33)
lot of dragon type Community Days yeah (74:30 - 74:37)
Dratini twice Dragon was last one for (74:33 - 74:39)
me uh I (74:37 - 74:44)
think I think fery was last for (74:39 - 74:44)
me yeah any I I don&#39;t (74:44 - 74:50)
know uh this is cool manke&#39;s fine (74:46 - 74:54)
manke&#39;s fine I love annihilate I was (74:50 - 74:57)
never a fan fan of the the Mankey line (74:54 - 75:00)
until annihilate so because I was (74:57 - 75:02)
someone who grew up with Pokemon when I (75:00 - 75:05)
was a kid on the playground I pretended (75:02 - 75:07)
to be a Mankey with my friends when we (75:05 - 75:10)
played Pokemon a recess so Mankey is (75:07 - 75:12)
close to my heart so I&#39;m happy about (75:10 - 75:14)
this I feel like even though Mankey (75:12 - 75:16)
appeared in what like one or two early (75:14 - 75:18)
episodes of the anime it was very (75:16 - 75:20)
impactful to like a lot of (75:18 - 75:24)
people was it I was also around when I (75:20 - 75:27)
was a child no we the episode where (75:24 - 75:30)
Mankey steals the hat and then they go (75:27 - 75:31)
in the boxing (75:30 - 75:34)
match I guess I just I don&#39;t know it&#39;s (75:31 - 75:37)
just again it&#39;s fine I feel like I (75:34 - 75:39)
definitely wanted a Mankey on my team (75:37 - 75:40)
because of the (75:39 - 75:42)
[Laughter] (75:40 - 75:44)
anime okay Mankey was version exclusive (75:42 - 75:46)
right it was it was it was exclusive to (75:44 - 75:49)
red and I had blue I think that was my (75:46 - 75:51)
problem was that I had blue as my first (75:49 - 75:53)
game (75:51 - 75:55)
so uh h (75:53 - 75:58)
part one this will start on Tuesday (75:55 - 76:01)
October 22nd it will run from Monday (75:58 - 76:03)
October 28th I&#39;m assuming there&#39;s a (76:01 - 76:06)
Halloween part two since they that would (76:03 - 76:09)
be weird if there wasn&#39;t just that just (76:06 - 76:12)
part one we&#39;re done uh morco will make (76:09 - 76:15)
its Pokemon go debut uh morco will (76:12 - 76:18)
charge into Pokemon go charge changing (76:15 - 76:19)
the way you will battle certain Pokemon (76:18 - 76:21)
like Barco will be able to change form (76:19 - 76:24)
in battle each time it uses its charged (76:21 - 76:26)
attack (76:24 - 76:28)
initially morco will only be able to (76:26 - 76:30)
change forms when battling team go (76:28 - 76:33)
rocket or in go battle League initially (76:30 - 76:35)
only be able to change forms oh okay so (76:33 - 76:38)
like it can&#39;t change form in raids is (76:35 - 76:43)
what it&#39;s saying right yeah um starting (76:38 - 76:44)
with this event you can find moreco in (76:43 - 76:47)

like go battle (78:49 - 78:55)
league go battle League match or win a (78:52 - 78:58)

think so where they did like the double (83:05 - 83:09)
candy they debuted like Sable eyee or (83:06 - 83:10)
something like that like I remember I (83:09 - 83:12)
remember people really freaking they (83:10 - 83:15)
changed the music um (83:12 - 83:18)
yeah yep I I would guess Halloween is (83:15 - 83:21)
like a good money maker for them yeah (83:18 - 83:22)
they go all in for Halloween and I (83:21 - 83:25)
really feel like this $100 bundle is for (83:22 - 83:26)
parents who are going to be out (83:25 - 83:27)
trick-or-treating with their (83:26 - 83:31)
kids just cuz it&#39;s all the incubators (83:27 - 83:32)
all the incubators a lot of (83:31 - 83:35)
walking what I&#39;m excited for with this (83:32 - 83:37)
event is that they&#39;re bringing back the (83:35 - 83:39)
whole thing where the map changes and (83:37 - 83:41)
there Halloween decorations and all of (83:39 - 83:42)
that and it&#39;s going to be different this (83:41 - 83:44)
year because we got all the visual (83:42 - 83:46)
[Music] (83:44 - 83:48)
updates so (83:46 - 83:51)
I&#39;m that artist yeah you got to buy that (83:48 - 83:54)
creepy crate I I will say like so they (83:51 - 83:56)
definitely have said they&#39;re going to be (83:54 - 83:59)
doing that with this which is cool uh (83:56 - 84:01)
was it the psychic (83:59 - 84:05)
spectacular maybe two years ago where (84:01 - 84:07)
like the sky (84:05 - 84:11)
changed and the event was it was really (84:07 - 84:12)
it was a really good event and I believe (84:11 - 84:14)
it was a psychic event I thought it was (84:12 - 84:16)
a psychic spectacular event and they had (84:14 - 84:18)
like a different sky and there was a (84:16 - 84:20)
whole bunch to it I don&#39;t remember the (84:18 - 84:21)
sky (84:20 - 84:23)
changing yeah it was like almost like an (84:21 - 84:25)
aurora (84:23 - 84:27)
or something like in the sky I do (84:25 - 84:28)
remember that but I don&#39;t think it was (84:27 - 84:30)
the psychic spectacular but I don&#39;t (84:28 - 84:33)
remember what event that was I just feel (84:30 - 84:35)
like fast forward to this year&#39;s psychic (84:33 - 84:38)
spectacular and I feel like the it (84:35 - 84:41)
wasn&#39;t where it was a couple years ago (84:38 - 84:43)
I&#39;m almost 100% it&#39;s like the same it (84:41 - 84:45)
was like the same time frame same event (84:43 - 84:47)
as a couple years ago remember a lot P (84:45 - 84:51)
spectacular two years ago was (84:47 - 84:51)
in maybe three years ago then maybe (84:51 - 84:58)
ago yeah I don&#39;t know anyways there too (84:55 - 85:00)
many of these events at this point I&#39;m (84:58 - 85:01)
yeah I&#39;m just saying that I hope that (85:00 - 85:03)
the Halloween event has always (85:01 - 85:06)
been exciting to people I feel like (85:03 - 85:08)
that&#39;s always been one of the bigger (85:06 - 85:10)
Global events that people really like (85:08 - 85:13)
every year and (85:10 - 85:16)
so I just it sounds like it will you (85:13 - 85:19)
know stay up to how exciting it&#39;s been (85:16 - 85:20)
every year especially because it&#39;s like (85:19 - 85:22)
two parts I think I think it&#39;s easy to (85:20 - 85:24)
look at this and be like H they&#39;re (85:22 - 85:26)
charging in $5 here and they&#39;re charging (85:24 - 85:28)
$2 here and I think that&#39;s I think (85:26 - 85:30)
that&#39;s fair criticism I I do think (85:28 - 85:32)
though like the wild encounters are are (85:30 - 85:35)
pretty good uh and the fact they&#39;re (85:32 - 85:37)
increasing shiny zuru in the wild is (85:35 - 85:40)
like really great yeah zuru is still (85:37 - 85:42)
exciting even though it&#39;s been around (85:40 - 85:44)
for a good while at this point every (85:42 - 85:46)
encounter with the zuro is still kind of (85:44 - 85:49)
fun um and we we don&#39;t know what part (85:46 - 85:51)
two is yet besides we know that the (85:49 - 85:53)
froak and the the the rowlet and the (85:51 - 85:55)
Pikachu seem to be more dominant in park (85:53 - 85:58)
two according to this paid research do (85:55 - 86:00)
we think we&#39;re getting mimikyu this year (85:58 - 86:03)
no 100% not is mimikyu GNA be the very (86:00 - 86:06)
last Pokemon that comes to Pokemon go (86:03 - 86:08)
how do we not get mimikyu no I don&#39;t I I (86:06 - 86:12)
I I I think I think it&#39;s very obvious to (86:08 - 86:16)
me that one mimikyu is not this year but (86:12 - 86:21)
two mimikyu will be debuted as morco is (86:16 - 86:24)
being debuted mimiku has a form change (86:21 - 86:26)
and now that they&#39;re okay with doing (86:24 - 86:28)
form changes and moreos being the first (86:26 - 86:30)
one with that form change so like think (86:28 - 86:32)
of every Pokemon that hasn&#39;t been (86:30 - 86:33)
released yet like we know that like (86:32 - 86:35)
smeargle for a really long time wasn&#39;t (86:33 - 86:36)
released not that that&#39;s a form change (86:35 - 86:38)
but that&#39;s like very specific and like (86:36 - 86:40)
kleon again not a form change but very (86:38 - 86:41)
specific it took them really long to (86:40 - 86:44)
release that but like morco mimikyu they (86:41 - 86:45)
both have obvious form changes another (86:44 - 86:47)
Pokemon not released that has a very (86:45 - 86:49)
obvious form change is Eis slash like (86:47 - 86:51)
that whole line is still not released (86:49 - 86:52)
unfortunately I hate saying it but (86:51 - 86:55)
karant has a form change and like so (86:52 - 86:58)
them saving karant for GBL now makes (86:55 - 87:01)
sense so like if if you&#39;re just like (86:58 - 87:04)
morco e SL karant (87:01 - 87:06)
mimiku uh there&#39;s probably some other (87:04 - 87:07)
Pokemon I can&#39;t think of off the top of (87:06 - 87:09)
my head it&#39;s it to me seems like these (87:07 - 87:12)
are going to be seasonal introductions (87:09 - 87:15)
for GBL and so like it&#39;s definitely more (87:12 - 87:17)
PCO this year no way is it going to be (87:15 - 87:20)
mimiku so we&#39;re like a year out from (87:17 - 87:22)
mimiku at the very late like there&#39;s no (87:20 - 87:24)
way they introduce mimiku in like the (87:22 - 87:25)
spring (87:24 - 87:28)
with like GBL oh they (87:25 - 87:32)
could they could um yeah no you&#39;re right (87:28 - 87:34)
and I was thinking that too because I (87:32 - 87:35)
was thinking no like they got to do (87:34 - 87:38)
mimik QQ but then with more PCO just on (87:35 - 87:40)
top of the form change thing and I was (87:38 - 87:42)
saying this to Hannah earlier it&#39;s like (87:40 - 87:45)
it&#39;s another like Pikachu related type (87:42 - 87:46)
Pokemon and it&#39;s like they don&#39;t want to (87:45 - 87:49)
do too many of those together I don&#39;t (87:46 - 87:51)
like so it&#39;s like more pekos coming (87:49 - 87:54)
that&#39;s the like sort of related to (87:51 - 87:55)
Pikachu and in some way right it&#39;s like (87:54 - 87:57)
the Galler like Mouse so it&#39;s like I (87:55 - 87:59)
don&#39;t think they would also do mimikyu (87:57 - 88:03)
at that same time but it is really (87:59 - 88:05)
annoying that they haven&#39;t released Miku (88:03 - 88:06)
yet after all these how long has it been (88:05 - 88:08)
since Pikachu and a mimiku costume has (88:06 - 88:11)
been like almost the entire game it was (88:08 - 88:12)
like the second it was one of the very (88:11 - 88:14)
first costumes yeah it was like the (88:12 - 88:17)
second Halloween I think so if we assume (88:14 - 88:20)
that next year is mimiku they also bring (88:17 - 88:23)
back the Pikachu in the mimiku costume (88:20 - 88:26)
to correspond (88:23 - 88:29)
because I would hope yeah they&#39;d have to (88:26 - 88:32)
it&#39;s been it&#39;s been so long since okay (88:29 - 88:34)
Pikachu and a mimikyu costume was (88:32 - 88:37)
2019 it looks like or maybe that&#39;s just (88:34 - 88:40)
the best one I have so deleted the older (88:37 - 88:42)
ones yeah but I feel like there was a (88:40 - 88:44)
mimik you hat in Pokemon go very very (88:42 - 88:46)
early on when yeah it was like right (88:44 - 88:48)
when a I think it was right around when (88:46 - 88:50)
alola when they remember they released (88:48 - 88:53)
just the alolan Pokemon that were (88:50 - 88:56)
uh just the that were like alolan forms (88:53 - 88:58)
like they it was like alolan exeggutor (88:56 - 89:01)
and alolan Marowak and alolan Raichu all (88:58 - 89:03)
came (89:01 - 89:06)
out like a very early back in 2018 yeah (89:03 - 89:08)
I think the mimikyu Hat was then no the (89:06 - 89:10)
mimikyu Hat was one of the very first (89:08 - 89:12)
hats it was literally the first hat you (89:10 - 89:15)
could buy in Pokémon go if this is in (89:12 - 89:16)
chronological (89:15 - 89:20)
order yeah hat and go is (89:16 - 89:23)
old yeah well one day one day we&#39;ll get (89:20 - 89:27)
the actual mimikyu in Pokemon (89:23 - 89:30)
go yeah I I I think mimikyu is probably (89:27 - 89:33)
a little more complicated than morco is (89:30 - 89:35)
like how do you how do you get the (89:33 - 89:37)
disguise to work in GBL that doesn&#39;t (89:35 - 89:41)
feel completely broken what&#39;s the other (89:37 - 89:43)
Pokemon that does something very similar (89:41 - 89:44)
to (89:43 - 89:48)
that what disguise yeah or are you (89:44 - 89:49)
talking about the form change cuz e (89:48 - 89:51)
slash is either Shield form or King form (89:49 - 89:53)
isn&#39;t there another Pokemon where like (89:51 - 89:55)
the first move you do on it doesn&#39;t do (89:53 - 89:59)
any damage it&#39;s not mimikyu ice Q ice Q (89:55 - 90:01)
yeah that&#39;s right ice Q ice ice (89:59 - 90:04)
Q uh ice CU is if you get hit by a (90:01 - 90:07)
physical move it still stays in uh what (90:04 - 90:10)
is it called nice form I think uh and (90:07 - 90:12)
then if it was hit with a special move (90:10 - 90:14)
that&#39;s when the face breaks and you get (90:12 - 90:18)
noise for got it right right no I yeah (90:14 - 90:20)
and I don&#39;t know how they even do that (90:18 - 90:24)
in GBL either but yeah I think I think (90:20 - 90:26)
ice is another Pokemon years away so I (90:24 - 90:29)
don&#39;t need to worry about iceq right now (90:26 - 90:31)
that&#39;s years away during the holiday (90:29 - 90:35)
season probably I I do think it&#39;s like (90:31 - 90:37)
interesting that they&#39;re going to (90:35 - 90:38)
experiment with forms in (90:37 - 90:41)
GBL uh like I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s good (90:38 - 90:45)
or bad I just think it&#39;s interesting um (90:41 - 90:46)
and so I guess we&#39;ll see with moreco how (90:45 - 90:49)
much people like it or dislike it or if (90:46 - 90:52)
it will be balanced in any sort of way (90:49 - 90:55)
but (90:52 - 90:57)
if you look at the Pokemon not released (90:55 - 90:59)
it&#39;s a lot of Pokemon that have gimmicks (90:57 - 91:02)
to it to them (90:59 - 91:06)
yep that is true that is true uh I (91:02 - 91:07)
Believe by the way real- time followup (91:06 - 91:10)
on this uh psychic spectacular I believe (91:07 - 91:12)
it was two years ago where this sky is a (91:10 - 91:14)
different color because it&#39;s like Mega (91:12 - 91:16)
Alakazam just looking at the image and (91:14 - 91:20)
the sky is all purple and pink I just I (91:16 - 91:22)
remember Steve you like loved this event (91:20 - 91:24)
this psychic spectacular event for like (91:22 - 91:25)
two years years ago and I don&#39;t love (91:24 - 91:27)
anything I don&#39;t believe (91:25 - 91:29)
this that&#39;s why it was so surprising to (91:27 - 91:32)
me that&#39;s why I remember oh yeah okay (91:29 - 91:35)
and so I just was thinking back to that (91:32 - 91:37)
event and I thought there&#39;s another (91:35 - 91:38)
event that I felt like was really (91:37 - 91:41)
well-liked when it came out and then (91:38 - 91:44)
we&#39;ve had the psychic spectacular and I (91:41 - 91:45)
think they did actually have it in 2021 (91:44 - 91:48)
as well um but in 2022 it was like (91:45 - 91:50)
really cool and then it kind of hasn&#39;t (91:48 - 91:55)
come back to that and I I just hope (91:50 - 91:56)
knowing that the Halloween event is (91:55 - 91:59)
always really exciting like people are (91:56 - 92:02)
really excited for it I hope that that (91:59 - 92:04)
level that energy stays up for the (92:02 - 92:07)
Halloween event as it continues on you (92:04 - 92:10)
know uh at some point people make get a (92:07 - 92:13)
little bored of it but based on what we (92:10 - 92:15)
have coming what what they&#39;ve shown us I (92:13 - 92:17)
think that it&#39;ll be uh I think people (92:15 - 92:19)
will enjoy this event I think it&#39;ll be (92:17 - 92:23)
good yeah and also the ink event was (92:19 - 92:24)
three days before that psychic (92:23 - 92:26)
spectacular you were talking about so (92:24 - 92:30)
all around the same time I remember the (92:26 - 92:32)
Inc research day or whatever yeah I (92:30 - 92:35)
remember that yep uh speaking of (92:32 - 92:38)
Halloween uh scarlet and violet like we (92:35 - 92:40)
said at the start of the show probably (92:38 - 92:42)
by the time this episode comes up there (92:40 - 92:46)
will be maybe another seven star raid (92:42 - 92:48)
we&#39;re running out of starter Pokemon we (92:46 - 92:49)
have (92:48 - 92:53)
feraligator and we have uh (92:49 - 92:55)
Torterra and I I think that&#39;s it I think (92:53 - 92:58)
was the last two I could be forgetting (92:55 - 93:03)
one but I think that&#39;s what we got left (92:58 - 93:06)
um (93:03 - 93:06)
which is is not enough to get us to the (93:08 - 93:12)
end of the (93:11 - 93:16)
year so I I could see them doing like a (93:12 - 93:18)
seven (93:16 - 93:21)
star Halloween Pokemon whether that&#39;s (93:18 - 93:24)
like Gengar or (93:21 - 93:29)
um houndstone or anything anything (93:24 - 93:31)
Halloween I think I don&#39;t think (93:29 - 93:33)
it&#39;s I don&#39;t think that would be weird (93:31 - 93:36)
or out of the norm since they did Iron (93:33 - 93:37)
bundle (93:36 - 93:39)
for (93:37 - 93:41)
um (93:39 - 93:44)
Christmas also November they&#39;re probably (93:41 - 93:46)
going to bring back seven star Eevee if (93:44 - 93:48)
they brought back sevenstar Pikachu (93:46 - 93:52)
Seven Star Eevee was pretty easy to run (93:48 - 93:55)
through um (93:52 - 93:56)
and if Seven Star Eevee comes back with (93:55 - 93:58)
like Urban mysa because every seven star (93:56 - 94:00)
has had Urban mystica now that would be (93:58 - 94:01)
really great for people who just want to (94:00 - 94:03)
grind out Urban mystica like there&#39;s (94:01 - 94:05)
tons of body pressors that work really (94:03 - 94:07)
well for Eevee so I can&#39;t imagine it (94:05 - 94:09)
would be much different since every (94:07 - 94:11)
seven star that has returned has not (94:09 - 94:12)
been different well Pikachu was (94:11 - 94:14)
different but different in an easier way (94:12 - 94:15)
they just didn&#39;t give it as much health (94:14 - 94:17)
anymore right (94:15 - 94:21)
um so I guess November has like an Eevee (94:17 - 94:24)
probably I would hope that do a (94:21 - 94:27)
sevenstar Halloween I don&#39;t really care (94:24 - 94:29)
what Pokemon it would be I just think (94:27 - 94:31)
Seven Star raids are (94:29 - 94:35)
fun I think they might do did they do a (94:31 - 94:38)
Halloween um Mass outbreak last year (94:35 - 94:43)
they did from what I remember so uh a a (94:38 - 94:46)
mass outbreak would also be really cool (94:43 - 94:48)
for them to (94:46 - 94:51)
do I know we got the the Clefairy was (94:48 - 94:55)
the first mass outbreak I remember (94:51 - 94:58)
yes wasn&#39;t there one with dpy at one (94:55 - 95:00)
point that was around that was more (94:58 - 95:04)
recent oh (95:00 - 95:04)
okay all right I see the iron bundle (95:04 - 95:10)
there was the dragon outbreak for (95:06 - 95:12)
Christmas that was (95:10 - 95:15)
Dratini dadon and jangma that was like (95:12 - 95:18)
the Christmas (95:15 - 95:18)
stuff (95:18 - 95:25)
um oh there was spooky Mass outbreaks (95:21 - 95:26)
yes there was there was the Ghost type (95:25 - 95:31)
Mass outbreak yeah I uh it was (95:26 - 95:34)
mimiku featured Pokemon drifloon Phantom (95:31 - 95:39)
mimiku gri location was Pala and Kim (95:34 - 95:42)
kakami (95:39 - 95:42)
uh they were not increased shiny but (95:42 - 95:46)
they were increased to have the crafty (95:44 - 95:48)
Mark (95:46 - 95:52)
mhm so got it and it was looks like it (95:48 - 95:55)
was only it was from from October 27th (95:52 - 95:58)
through Halloween through the end of (95:55 - 96:00)
October there was the the trick-or treat (95:58 - 96:05)
Miss Magus raids where five star mmus (96:00 - 96:08)
you would get more can rare candy for (96:05 - 96:11)
battling mmus (96:08 - 96:14)
yeah yeah so I could see them doing this (96:11 - 96:17)
I mean so Halloween falls on a (96:14 - 96:22)
Thursday this year (96:17 - 96:24)
so I do wonder if they&#39;ll make it a (96:22 - 96:26)
bigger event maybe like starting it the (96:24 - 96:28)
previous Thursday and then running it (96:26 - 96:31)
through the end of the week that the (96:28 - 96:33)
Halloween weekend (96:31 - 96:35)
maybe which would be (96:33 - 96:37)
cool something like that they could just (96:35 - 96:39)
do it like Halloween through that like (96:37 - 96:40)
that Thursday through the weekend as (96:39 - 96:44)
well I guess so yeah I think the the the (96:40 - 96:47)
the we&#39;re picking three Pokemon one on (96:44 - 96:49)
palale one in kakami one in blueberry I (96:47 - 96:51)
think that&#39;s like a really good system (96:49 - 96:54)
they&#39;ve been doing (96:51 - 96:54)
so it&#39;d be neat (96:56 - 97:03)
yeah is there (96:59 - 97:08)
a alolan or gallerian Ghost Pokemon that (97:03 - 97:11)
exist in the (97:08 - 97:11)
game put the like you know how they did (97:12 - 97:19)
like alolan Raichu yeah (97:15 - 97:19)
outbreaks I don&#39;t think so don&#39;t (97:21 - 97:27)
know alolan (97:28 - 97:33)
marrow is not in but cubone&#39;s not in the (97:31 - 97:36)

[Laughter] (97:41 - 97:46)
spooky (97:44 - 97:50)
grimer grimer kind of (97:46 - 97:54)
spooky kind of creepy yeah (97:50 - 97:56)
is you find them all over the place (97:54 - 97:59)
though yeah that is true I still believe (97:56 - 98:02)
there will be uh an event which is (97:59 - 98:05)
regular Meowth alolan (98:02 - 98:05)
Meowth I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a Halloween (98:06 - 98:10)
event but I do think they&#39;ll put all (98:09 - 98:13)
three meows yeah I mean (98:10 - 98:17)
garan like perser is kind of creepy in (98:13 - 98:20)
itself I think we&#39;re past National Cat (98:17 - 98:23)
Day no National Cat Day is later this (98:20 - 98:24)
month it&#39;s actually right before (98:23 - 98:27)
Halloween it looks like so (98:24 - 98:30)
oh what if they did (98:27 - 98:34)
it is corsola in the (98:30 - 98:36)
game I don&#39;t think so in this game I (98:34 - 98:39)
don&#39;t think (98:36 - 98:39)
so plays it a lot more than yeah yeah (98:42 - 98:47)
you (98:45 - 98:47)
think Garian (98:48 - 98:54)
wheezing that&#39;s not really Halloweeny (98:51 - 98:58)
Halloween uh y mask I don&#39;t think is in (98:54 - 99:01)
no y mask is not in the game perser or (98:58 - 99:04)
the whole Zig zigon line not in the game (99:01 - 99:07)
farfetch not in the (99:04 - 99:07)
game Mr MIM not in the (99:07 - 99:14)
game uh damaka is also (99:11 - 99:19)
not in the game at (99:14 - 99:19)
all yeah no no Dar 10 or anything (99:19 - 99:26)
yeah well we&#39;ll see what they (99:24 - 99:28)
do they could do like you know what (99:26 - 99:30)
would actually be cool uh because gutina (99:28 - 99:33)
is in the game doing like a five star (99:30 - 99:35)
gutina because they did five star um (99:33 - 99:37)
Diga and palia and that was really (99:35 - 99:41)
really popular true yep so like a five (99:37 - 99:43)
star (99:41 - 99:45)
gutina because it is allowed in the it&#39;s (99:43 - 99:49)
not one of snacks worths Pokemon you can (99:45 - 99:51)
get but neither was Diago and palia but (99:49 - 99:54)
gutina is allowed in the game (99:51 - 99:57)
mhm so that would probably be the (99:54 - 99:58)
coolest I think people would be more (99:57 - 100:01)
excited for a five-star gutina than a (99:58 - 100:03)
sevenstar (100:01 - 100:06)
houndstone oh yes for sure a gutina (100:03 - 100:08)
would actually bring bring peao back I (100:06 - 100:10)
don&#39;t think oh yeah yeah a houndstone (100:08 - 100:13)
would I always like I know I know it&#39;s (100:10 - 100:16)
like a small target market but I always (100:13 - 100:18)
like rank how popular sevenstar raids (100:16 - 100:20)
are based on how many people view my (100:18 - 100:23)
RAID guides and the amount of people (100:20 - 100:26)
that viewed my Diaga imp Palkia raid (100:23 - 100:28)
guide was like insane and I didn&#39;t even (100:26 - 100:30)
think to do one cuz I was like oh it&#39;s (100:28 - 100:31)
just a five star and then people were (100:30 - 100:32)
like we&#39;re having trouble can you make a (100:31 - 100:34)
raid guy I was like I guess they&#39;re just (100:32 - 100:36)
five star but like but like that one was (100:34 - 100:39)
viewed so much but I think it&#39;s (100:36 - 100:40)
legitimately because people were like I (100:39 - 100:41)
just want this Pokemon what&#39;s the (100:40 - 100:45)
easiest way to like get a DI like it&#39;s (100:41 - 100:47)
