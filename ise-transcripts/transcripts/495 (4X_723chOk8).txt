you're watching the youtube version we (1:10 - 1:14)
also we have we have to consistently (1:12 - 1:16)
have one person knitting at all times or (1:14 - 1:18)
is that that i am crocheting a pancake (1:16 - 1:20)
or saying there are not enough in my (1:18 - 1:22)
environment currently (1:20 - 1:23)
this will crochet or does he knit he (1:22 - 1:25)
knits i think he does both (1:23 - 1:27)
i think he does both too he does both (1:25 - 1:29)
but he's knitting that's like what (1:27 - 1:30)
everyone always comments on the youtube (1:29 - 1:31)
is what is he making i think it's a bit (1:30 - 1:33)
it's always the same it's been a blanket (1:31 - 1:36)
for 15 years he's not done with it (1:33 - 1:38)
it's never going to be done never that's (1:36 - 1:39)
the thing about knitters and crocheters (1:38 - 1:42)
they are never done excuse i finish many (1:39 - 1:44)
penguins (1:42 - 1:45)
are you like many people who are like i (1:44 - 1:47)
got to the end of the i messed up one (1:45 - 1:48)
part so i ended the whole thing and (1:47 - 1:51)
started over i do do that yeah yeah see (1:48 - 1:52)
what (1:51 - 1:56)
that sounds awful it it's tragic got a (1:52 - 1:57)
good instagram reel out of me unraveling (1:56 - 2:00)
it though (1:57 - 2:00)
i don't know like if this podcast is a (2:00 - 2:05)
disaster we just keep going that's like (2:02 - 2:07)
we can't unravel it (2:05 - 2:10)
i mean here's the thing we could (2:07 - 2:11)
we should (2:10 - 2:13)
we don't (2:11 - 2:14)
correct (2:13 - 2:19)
we got uh some pokemon news this week (2:14 - 2:19)
nothing's happening where should we (2:20 - 2:24)
start uh knowing our luck because we're (2:21 - 2:26)
recording sundays this comes out on (2:24 - 2:27)
monday (2:26 - 2:30)
uh that japanese (2:27 - 2:31)
arceus trailer will probably be (2:30 - 2:33)
eventually in english why isn't it in (2:31 - 2:36)
english i watched it like three times in (2:33 - 2:37)
japanese and hoping that i could (2:36 - 2:39)
understand it i didn't (2:37 - 2:40)
um (2:39 - 2:41)
here's the fourth time it really clicks (2:40 - 2:42)
with you (2:41 - 2:45)
i have to watch it again (2:42 - 2:47)
that water looks real good though oh (2:45 - 2:49)
gosh the water is the worst part of that (2:47 - 2:52)
whole trailer what do you i what i i (2:49 - 2:53)
want you (2:52 - 2:56)
to put together a slideshow of games (2:53 - 2:58)
that you like the water in (2:56 - 3:00)
i would argue that brilliant diamond (2:58 - 3:01)
shining pearl have pretty good water (3:00 - 3:04)
bdsp has very nice water i can second (3:01 - 3:05)
that (3:04 - 3:06)
it's because it's using the unity engine (3:05 - 3:09)
unity makes real nice water (3:06 - 3:10)
again i (3:09 - 3:13)
next weekend i would like a powerpoint (3:10 - 3:15)
together of your favorite water bits (3:13 - 3:17)
do we do we want to talk about that (3:15 - 3:19)
trailer first i mean i (3:17 - 3:20)
there's (3:19 - 3:22)
i would have more to talk about if i (3:20 - 3:24)
understood half of the things (3:22 - 3:26)
that were happening like the whole (3:24 - 3:28)
section of throwing (3:26 - 3:29)
packets (3:28 - 3:31)
at the pokemon (3:29 - 3:33)
it (3:31 - 3:33)
and i don't know why it's important (3:33 - 3:37)
because i couldn't understand what they (3:35 - 3:39)
were saying (3:37 - 3:39)
um i have not watched the trailer so for (3:39 - 3:43)
me and the one other person listening to (3:41 - 3:46)
this who hasn't yet can i get like a (3:43 - 3:48)
tldr of the trailer (3:46 - 3:50)
here's the tldr it shows a lot of (3:48 - 3:52)
pokemon arceus in japanese and it (3:50 - 3:54)
explains a bunch of things that i didn't (3:52 - 3:56)
understand because the explanation was (3:54 - 3:58)
in japanese i don't think there was (3:56 - 4:00)
anything new except for there's a bunch (3:58 - 4:02)
of red-eyed pokemon that are literally (4:00 - 4:04)
trying to murder you in the overworld (4:02 - 4:06)
they showed that a lot (4:04 - 4:06)
i (4:06 - 4:09)
also don't think there's anything new (4:06 - 4:10)
because (4:09 - 4:12)
serebii would have (4:10 - 4:14)
pointed that out yeah there was anything (4:12 - 4:15)
new i think there's (4:14 - 4:17)
there's there's (4:15 - 4:19)
three new areas that they showed yeah (4:17 - 4:20)
and there was explanations like they (4:19 - 4:22)
explained (4:20 - 4:24)
photography a bit more (4:22 - 4:25)
uh they introduced the great great great (4:24 - 4:27)
great great grandmother of caitlin's (4:25 - 4:29)
butler (4:27 - 4:32)
she's new (4:29 - 4:32)
they showed a gold duck (4:34 - 4:37)
yeah they showed a gold duck they showed (4:36 - 4:39)
a gym char (4:37 - 4:40)
in the wild (4:39 - 4:42)
they showed up (4:40 - 4:45)
crowbat that was new (4:42 - 4:48)
so is this is this um i (4:45 - 4:50)
i have not been following legends (4:48 - 4:52)
because i'm like not an action rpg type (4:50 - 4:55)
person much like um so (4:52 - 4:56)
is there going to be like a combat (4:55 - 4:58)
mechanic is that what the these red-eyed (4:56 - 5:00)
pokemon are where you like actually (4:58 - 5:01)
fight them outside of like a turn-based (5:00 - 5:04)
battle yeah so it does definitely seem (5:01 - 5:07)
like you will run into angry pokemon who (5:04 - 5:10)
are very very aggressive unlike (5:07 - 5:14)
non-red-eyed pokemon who (5:10 - 5:15)
are aggressive only if you seem to (5:14 - 5:17)
bother them (5:15 - 5:19)
these at least again i can't i didn't (5:17 - 5:21)
have a translation and i don't know what (5:19 - 5:22)
they're saying but it did seem like (5:21 - 5:25)
you'll run into red eyed pokemon who are (5:22 - 5:27)
very much into attacking you and trying (5:25 - 5:28)
to kill you (5:27 - 5:30)
well that's that it is (5:28 - 5:31)
action based (5:30 - 5:33)
it is (5:31 - 5:35)
at some point you like throw your (5:33 - 5:37)
pokeball (5:35 - 5:39)
at them and your partner comes out and (5:37 - 5:41)
then you go into (5:39 - 5:44)
action slash turn based (5:41 - 5:46)
combat but it seems much more real-time (5:44 - 5:48)
action (5:46 - 5:51)
than turn-based like (5:48 - 5:52)
interesting did you ever play chrono (5:51 - 5:54)
trigger that had the bars that went up (5:52 - 5:55)
and then when it hit the top of the bar (5:54 - 5:57)
you got to do an action it felt like (5:55 - 5:59)
that to me that was final fantasy (5:57 - 6:00)
7 (5:59 - 6:02)
yeah (6:00 - 6:04)
that feels a lot like that like there's (6:02 - 6:06)
a charging and then you can use an (6:04 - 6:07)
attack (6:06 - 6:09)
um the animations don't look any (6:07 - 6:10)
different than they did in sword and (6:09 - 6:13)
shield that i saw in there they looked (6:10 - 6:14)
the same (6:13 - 6:16)
uh water coming out of the belly button (6:14 - 6:17)
instead of the mouth and things like and (6:16 - 6:19)
giant (6:17 - 6:21)
jaws for bite instead of like just a (6:19 - 6:24)
bite (6:21 - 6:24)
there is something with the rotten bags (6:24 - 6:28)
of fruit or whatever they are couldn't (6:26 - 6:31)
tell you they were talking about it for (6:28 - 6:32)
a while in japanese and they didn't know (6:31 - 6:34)
him they showed a citrus berry to show (6:32 - 6:37)
the citrus berry they showed that you (6:34 - 6:38)
need (6:37 - 6:41)
uh some a rock that looks like meat and (6:38 - 6:44)
something else to make pokeballs (6:41 - 6:46)
the red rock you have to make your own (6:44 - 6:48)
pokeballs in this game yeah yeah that's (6:46 - 6:50)
what it seems like i mean you have a god (6:48 - 6:52)
phone but you still have to make poke (6:50 - 6:54)
ball so they brought crafting into (6:52 - 6:57)
pokemon yeah well (6:54 - 6:59)
yeah yeah (6:57 - 7:02)
maybe i like this game (6:59 - 7:04)
showed more of the character they showed (7:02 - 7:06)
characters that they had introduced (7:04 - 7:08)
before but i don't know if they said (7:06 - 7:09)
something new about them because i (7:08 - 7:11)
couldn't understand it (7:09 - 7:12)
um (7:11 - 7:14)
they showed some sweet water (7:12 - 7:16)
they showed some sweet lava we went (7:14 - 7:18)
through all the ride pokemon again yeah (7:16 - 7:20)
they did all their pokemon they did all (7:18 - 7:22)
of the (7:20 - 7:26)
uh areas again (7:22 - 7:26)
it's also just kind of confusing they (7:27 - 7:31)
that they have (7:30 - 7:32)
pinned (7:31 - 7:35)
ever since x and y these games as was (7:32 - 7:37)
worldwide games (7:35 - 7:39)
and so to release a japanese trailer (7:37 - 7:42)
that doesn't actually say that much (7:39 - 7:45)
and not have an english trailer seems (7:42 - 7:48)
weird yeah i don't it's like it's it's a (7:45 - 7:51)
game play trailer like everywhere i see (7:48 - 7:53)
referred to it as a game play trailer (7:51 - 7:55)
and it does go through aspects of (7:53 - 7:57)
gameplay (7:55 - 7:58)
i guess i just don't know why there's (7:57 - 8:00)
not an english version (7:58 - 8:02)
yet (8:00 - 8:02)
i would also argue (8:03 - 8:06)
sorry drinking drinking here i would (8:05 - 8:09)
also argue that (8:06 - 8:11)
i don't think this trailer convinces (8:09 - 8:14)
anyone who's on the fence (8:11 - 8:14)
it's it like it shows (8:14 - 8:19)
a lot of what we already know and (8:17 - 8:21)
nothing where (8:19 - 8:23)
like like i didn't know they showed the (8:21 - 8:25)
i'm going to throw the ramen packet bags (8:23 - 8:28)
at you and like spice you up before i'm (8:25 - 8:30)
ultimately probably going to catch you (8:28 - 8:32)
and we've seen that before we've seen (8:30 - 8:33)
that like twice (8:32 - 8:35)
and they showed that again in this (8:33 - 8:37)
trailer but they showed it even longer (8:35 - 8:39)
like he throws like eight (8:37 - 8:41)
yeah ramen packets (8:39 - 8:44)
and it's and i i still have questions i (8:41 - 8:46)
i don't know why i'm doing this why why (8:44 - 8:48)
am i why are we spicing up the cleaver (8:46 - 8:50)
it's hard to say (8:48 - 8:52)
that it didn't (8:50 - 8:55)
it didn't make a case (8:52 - 8:56)
to people who are on the fence about the (8:55 - 8:58)
game because i don't know what they said (8:56 - 8:59)
like i don't know if the explanation of (8:58 - 9:01)
what was happening (8:59 - 9:03)
was a good explanation and a selling (9:01 - 9:06)
point like the game looks good (9:03 - 9:07)
it (9:06 - 9:11)
looks i think we got to see more (9:07 - 9:14)
action in a more polished environment (9:11 - 9:16)
because it did look better visually it (9:14 - 9:18)
looked better yes (9:16 - 9:20)
so i think (9:18 - 9:20)
those things (9:21 - 9:25)
maybe push people over i mean the water (9:23 - 9:27)
is brilliant i mean i'm looking at the (9:25 - 9:28)
water i have in my glass right now and (9:27 - 9:30)
it looks the same (9:28 - 9:32)
interesting the the one thing that was (9:30 - 9:34)
new but really not that new and again (9:32 - 9:36)
not like a selling point is that we (9:34 - 9:38)
found out that zoroark is probably like (9:36 - 9:40)
the second or third boss (9:38 - 9:41)
yeah (9:40 - 9:43)
because we know cleaver is like the (9:41 - 9:44)
first (9:43 - 9:45)
boss (9:44 - 9:46)
because it has the boss meter that they (9:45 - 9:48)
showed in like the last trailer and then (9:46 - 9:51)
there's like a split like three seconds (9:48 - 9:52)
where (9:51 - 9:56)
his suey and zoroark has that same boss (9:52 - 9:58)
meter yeah (9:56 - 10:00)
so we know that so i guess that is like (9:58 - 10:01)
the one bit of new information we have (10:00 - 10:04)
is this pokemon is one of the i'm (10:01 - 10:05)
assuming there's eight of them right (10:04 - 10:07)
like that's that yeah yes well they (10:05 - 10:10)
showed a thing with a bunch of stars (10:07 - 10:12)
and it couldn't oh yeah (10:10 - 10:14)
i couldn't tell if the stars were going (10:12 - 10:15)
to mark off wardens because they were a (10:14 - 10:16)
lot (10:15 - 10:18)
i think they were like 10 (10:16 - 10:20)
and not eight so i don't know what the (10:18 - 10:24)
stars were because again i was like okay (10:20 - 10:26)
here we go (10:24 - 10:27)
wait pengu were you planning on getting (10:26 - 10:28)
this game (10:27 - 10:31)
uh no i'm not planning on getting it i'm (10:28 - 10:33)
planning on watching you play it (10:31 - 10:36)
interesting (10:33 - 10:36)
it's because it's uh it's because it's (10:36 - 10:39)
not traditional right it's like the (10:38 - 10:40)
action (10:39 - 10:42)
yes i'm one of i'm one of the people who (10:40 - 10:45)
likes the the easy train track tell me (10:42 - 10:46)
where to go otherwise i can't navigate (10:45 - 10:49)
it myself make let me just like beat the (10:46 - 10:51)
gym leaders first try let me over level (10:49 - 10:53)
as much as i can i just want like a (10:51 - 10:57)
chill easy pokemon experience um and (10:53 - 10:59)
legend sounds stressful (10:57 - 11:03)
hmm yeah i don't (10:59 - 11:03)
like maneuvering through the world (11:03 - 11:10)
i i couldn't tell if (11:07 - 11:10)
only pokemon with red eyes actively (11:11 - 11:15)
pursue you like they did in the wild (11:14 - 11:18)
area and everything else was i couldn't (11:15 - 11:19)
tell that very well from the trailer (11:18 - 11:21)
because it looked like they like they (11:19 - 11:22)
walked past this field who was just (11:21 - 11:24)
super happy and smiley and staring at (11:22 - 11:25)
you (11:24 - 11:27)
so at least like (11:25 - 11:29)
we know that not all of them are going (11:27 - 11:31)
to attack you but i couldn't tell in the (11:29 - 11:32)
trailer if they are trying to (11:31 - 11:34)
differentiate between (11:32 - 11:37)
watch out for things that have red eyes (11:34 - 11:38)
versus (11:37 - 11:40)
regular eyes because the red eyes ones (11:38 - 11:44)
are going to pursue you (11:40 - 11:45)
i'm kind of guessing that the red eye (11:44 - 11:48)
ones are just like overleveled (11:45 - 11:49)
like um (11:48 - 11:50)
[Music] (11:49 - 11:51)
when you went to the wild area for the (11:50 - 11:53)
first time there would be (11:51 - 11:55)
strong pokemon that you couldn't catch i (11:53 - 11:56)
don't know that's kind of what i thought (11:55 - 11:58)
but who knows (11:56 - 11:59)
what i do know (11:58 - 12:02)
is this off bleedingcool.com pokemon (11:59 - 12:04)
legends arceus becomes the latest tetris (12:02 - 12:07)
99 cup focus (12:04 - 12:11)
we're ball playing tetris 99 still right (12:07 - 12:14)
i still play tetris 99 oh let's see (12:11 - 12:16)
there we go (12:14 - 12:18)
so that's exciting greg's trying to (12:16 - 12:20)
remember what this game is yeah what is (12:18 - 12:23)
tetris 99 what kind of free tetris game (12:20 - 12:25)
that you get with switch online i think (12:23 - 12:27)
and you like play with 98 other people (12:25 - 12:30)
99 other people like with tetris battles (12:27 - 12:33)
the only 99 thing that was ever good was (12:30 - 12:35)
one versus 100 (12:33 - 12:37)
that was very good (12:35 - 12:38)
and since it's not that i've never (12:37 - 12:40)
played (12:38 - 12:41)
you've never played tetris 99 do you (12:40 - 12:43)
like tetris greg that's like your game (12:41 - 12:45)
you grew up i think that's like my game (12:43 - 12:46)
what (12:45 - 12:48)
what are you trying to say about greg (12:46 - 12:50)
here please look around my room to point (12:48 - 12:53)
out the vast tetris merch i suddenly (12:50 - 12:57)
have where did that statement come from (12:53 - 12:57)
is she like older than tetris itself (12:57 - 13:04)
i was there when tetris was created yes (13:00 - 13:05)
that does not mean i was abort the (13:04 - 13:07)
tetris train (13:05 - 13:08)
you're telling me you did not like (13:07 - 13:11)
tetris as a kid i was fine okay but that (13:08 - 13:14)
wasn't tetris wasn't as a kid for me (13:11 - 13:16)
that's not a kid game for me pac-man was (13:14 - 13:18)
a kid game for me (13:16 - 13:22)
wait pac-man's older than tetris (13:18 - 13:22)
i think that's just pretty old (13:23 - 13:28)
i cannot with you (13:25 - 13:31)
just hand (13:28 - 13:31)
tetris was 1984 i was 44. and then it (13:31 - 13:37)
came over (13:35 - 13:39)
it got big in (13:37 - 13:42)
86 i want to say (13:39 - 13:43)
um (13:42 - 13:45)
i i my first experience was tetr with (13:43 - 13:47)
tetris was the (13:45 - 13:50)
the game boy where they were playing (13:47 - 13:52)
tetris for free when you bought a game (13:50 - 13:53)
boy (13:52 - 13:57)
i mean pac-man was 1980 so like (13:53 - 13:59)
i would have when did i get a game boy (13:57 - 14:00)
90 (13:59 - 14:02)
because i think i only had tetris on the (14:00 - 14:03)
game boy (14:02 - 14:06)
but again i was in my teens so i would (14:03 - 14:08)
have had to purchase games on with my (14:06 - 14:09)
own (14:08 - 14:10)
money (14:09 - 14:13)
so i only played tetris when other (14:10 - 14:14)
people had it then they convinced me to (14:13 - 14:18)
buy it and then my mom was addicted to (14:14 - 14:20)
tetris so she would steal my game boy do (14:18 - 14:23)
play tetris moms love tetris moms do (14:20 - 14:25)
love tetris i'm going to out myself as a (14:23 - 14:27)
real zoomer here but i first really got (14:25 - 14:29)
into tetris when it was like tetris (14:27 - 14:31)
friends on facebook where you could like (14:29 - 14:33)
play tetris with your facebook friends (14:31 - 14:36)
that's when i got really into tetris (14:33 - 14:38)
pokemon podcast over i needed to hear (14:36 - 14:42)
about facebook games what that was a (14:38 - 14:44)
game on facebook yeah it was great you (14:42 - 14:46)
could like battle your friends got real (14:44 - 14:48)
good at it got the typical ds game (14:46 - 14:50)
played my pink ds light at lunch at (14:48 - 14:51)
school (14:50 - 14:53)
was it like real tetris or was it like (14:51 - 14:56)
knockoff tetris what's (14:53 - 14:56)
do you define (14:56 - 14:59)
three people listening to this podcast (15:03 - 15:05)
know what i'm talking about when the (15:04 - 15:07)
when the iphone (15:05 - 15:09)
first got an app store which was the (15:07 - 15:11)
second year of the iphone and you could (15:09 - 15:14)
download apps there was a tetris game (15:11 - 15:15)
that came out within like the first (15:14 - 15:17)
month of like the app store it was (15:15 - 15:21)
called tris t-r-i-s oh i do remember (15:17 - 15:25)
that it was a really good tetris game (15:21 - 15:27)
but it wasn't tetris (15:25 - 15:30)
and then the creators of tetris (15:27 - 15:34)
like dmcad them or whatever legally did (15:30 - 15:36)
something and then triss had to be (15:34 - 15:38)
removed and it was the first one of (15:36 - 15:40)
those games because it happened flappy (15:38 - 15:42)
bird too where like flappy bird was (15:40 - 15:44)
removed and people were like i have (15:42 - 15:47)
tris on my phone and then they would (15:44 - 15:49)
sell their phone (15:47 - 15:52)
people wanted the game (15:49 - 15:54)
and i had tris and there was a really (15:52 - 15:55)
long time where i was like i can't erase (15:54 - 15:59)
my phone i can't transfer to a new phone (15:55 - 16:03)
cause i don't want to lose tris (15:59 - 16:03)
i'm assuming the facebook one was (16:04 - 16:09)
officially through like tetris though (16:06 - 16:11)
it was yeah (16:09 - 16:13)
so is this where your obsession over not (16:11 - 16:15)
flipping your phone horizontally came (16:13 - 16:18)
from tetris (16:15 - 16:18)
i mean tetris is designed tetris is very (16:18 - 16:23)
like designed for i mean i'm sure there (16:20 - 16:26)
is a tetris an actual tetris (16:23 - 16:29)
i will say this i played a lot more dr (16:26 - 16:32)
mario than i played tetris oh tetris is (16:29 - 16:34)
way better than dr mario are you what is (16:32 - 16:37)
wrong with you (16:34 - 16:38)
tetris doesn't have cute little dancing (16:37 - 16:40)
germs also (16:38 - 16:42)
tetris tetris is from russia which if (16:40 - 16:45)
you remember is the enemy (16:42 - 16:46)
so (16:45 - 16:48)
yeah that's yes that's what society has (16:46 - 16:49)
taught us (16:48 - 16:50)
um (16:49 - 16:52)
look i was not about to give into the (16:50 - 16:56)
red propaganda playing tetris the 80s (16:52 - 16:58)
that's for communists (16:56 - 17:01)
i watched red dawn (16:58 - 17:02)
the (17:01 - 17:04)
that movie i'm aware of that movie (17:02 - 17:06)
existing nintendo's launching another (17:04 - 17:09)
maximus cup in tetris 99 this week the (17:06 - 17:11)
focus is around pokemon legends arceus (17:09 - 17:13)
the latest entry of the pokemon series (17:11 - 17:15)
has not been released but does not stop (17:13 - 17:16)
being fans for getting psyched up for (17:15 - 17:19)
the this is this is good timing you (17:16 - 17:21)
release the tetris event before the game (17:19 - 17:22)
comes out not this (17:21 - 17:24)
not this like same weekend that they (17:22 - 17:26)
always do here's eight things the same (17:24 - 17:28)
weekend again no you build the hype you (17:26 - 17:31)
release it a week before well (17:28 - 17:34)
janine is not in charge of that calendar (17:31 - 17:37)
also what does that mean (17:34 - 17:38)
how much (17:37 - 17:42)
99 is going to be like is it going to be (17:38 - 17:45)
pokemon instead of blocks (17:42 - 17:48)
like oh you can explain pengu uh i i'm (17:45 - 17:49)
not going to explain i was just going to (17:48 - 17:51)
speculate wildly but it sounds like you (17:49 - 17:54)
actually know the answer so i do (17:51 - 17:55)
so though they'll pick different themes (17:54 - 17:57)
they've done like fire emblem they did (17:55 - 17:58)
sword and shield we covered this on the (17:57 - 18:00)
podcast (17:58 - 18:01)
so (18:00 - 18:03)
it's still just normal tetris except the (18:01 - 18:06)
background will be pokemon and then the (18:03 - 18:08)
music will be pokemon that's literally (18:06 - 18:10)
like the only two changes okay that's (18:08 - 18:12)
what i was going to speculate wildly i (18:10 - 18:16)
speculated correctly (18:12 - 18:16)
how does that convince people to buy (18:17 - 18:22)
this game (18:19 - 18:22)
is it is it supposed to convince people (18:22 - 18:26)
to buy this game (18:23 - 18:26)
um if you're like a tetris fan and (18:27 - 18:31)
you're like oh there's a new pokemon (18:29 - 18:34)
game coming out i don't know (18:31 - 18:36)
maybe to alert tetris fans of a new game (18:34 - 18:37)
also (18:36 - 18:39)
also this is like bare minimum marketing (18:37 - 18:42)
right like they had to make a wallpaper (18:39 - 18:44)
for tetris and they had to like make (18:42 - 18:47)
like two different music tracks like the (18:44 - 18:49)
like the normal music and then like (18:47 - 18:51)
you're about to get eliminated music (18:49 - 18:53)
like that's (18:51 - 18:55)
really bare bones here (18:53 - 18:58)
now the event is from january 20th (18:55 - 18:59)
through the 24th and if you get a (18:58 - 19:01)
hundred points and you just get like (18:59 - 19:03)
five points for even playing a match you (19:01 - 19:06)
get to keep the theme after the theme is (19:03 - 19:07)
gone (19:06 - 19:10)
so it is it is the sense of urgency (19:07 - 19:12)
so like if you didn't play during the (19:10 - 19:14)
the couple days they had the sword and (19:12 - 19:16)
shield theme (19:14 - 19:17)
you don't you can't have it anymore but (19:16 - 19:19)
if you did get enough points (19:17 - 19:21)
then at any point i can switch to the (19:19 - 19:23)
sword and shield them just to like have (19:21 - 19:25)
that music but (19:23 - 19:28)
only you can see it right (19:25 - 19:28)
look there there is a probably a very (19:30 - 19:34)
hardcore (19:32 - 19:35)
audience out there that wants to collect (19:34 - 19:39)
every tetris theme (19:35 - 19:41)
that they pump out here (19:39 - 19:42)
y'all are wild (19:41 - 19:44)
or you know if you're someone like steve (19:42 - 19:46)
who has put 2000 hours into sword and (19:44 - 19:48)
shield and you heaven forbid open a new (19:46 - 19:50)
game and miss the sword and shield music (19:48 - 19:54)
you can have it yeah (19:50 - 19:57)
you know what tetris is lacking (19:54 - 19:59)
sword and shield music i'm tired of (19:57 - 20:01)
russia (19:59 - 20:03)
bring me to galler (20:01 - 20:06)
the tetris scene tetris theme song does (20:03 - 20:09)
slap so i would choose that um if given (20:06 - 20:12)
the option (20:09 - 20:13)
tetris is one of those games where (20:12 - 20:15)
you're like i'm really good at tetris in (20:13 - 20:18)
your immediate friend group and then you (20:15 - 20:20)
take one step out of that friend group (20:18 - 20:21)
and you realize that you are not you are (20:20 - 20:24)
very bad at it oh yeah that that's me (20:21 - 20:28)
[Laughter] (20:24 - 20:29)
uh (20:28 - 20:31)
speaking of friends (20:29 - 20:32)

the (22:50 - 22:54)
bad hoodie is still coming soon you know (22:52 - 22:56)
if i if i was (22:54 - 22:58)
there's like this i cannot i'm so glad (22:56 - 23:00)
i'm not in a shoe culture (22:58 - 23:03)
the the the people who are on these like (23:00 - 23:05)
six different apps to like wait for (23:03 - 23:07)
nikes to drop to like (23:05 - 23:09)
get in a digital line or you ever go to (23:07 - 23:11)
the mall and there's like a line outside (23:09 - 23:12)
of (23:11 - 23:13)
champs (23:12 - 23:15)
and they're like waiting for (23:13 - 23:18)
like shoe culture seems worse than the (23:15 - 23:20)
the when we were in that pokemon drought (23:18 - 23:23)
for tcg cards it seems awful (23:20 - 23:25)
and then there's like the whole thing of (23:23 - 23:27)
do you even wear these shoes do you just (23:25 - 23:28)
keep them in the boxes you put them in (23:27 - 23:30)
boxes you put them on your wall and no (23:28 - 23:33)
but then i saw on tick-tock (23:30 - 23:34)
which is probably inaccurate because i (23:33 - 23:35)
started off the sentence saying i saw (23:34 - 23:37)
this on tv attack (23:35 - 23:40)
of people who did collect shoes and then (23:37 - 23:42)
didn't wear them and then talked about (23:40 - 23:45)
how the shoe falls apart faster (23:42 - 23:48)
because you don't wear them (23:45 - 23:48)
how does it fall apart if you're not (23:48 - 23:51)
touching it (23:50 - 23:53)
yeah does it just just disintegrates on (23:51 - 23:55)
your shoulders through the process of (23:53 - 23:57)
how it falls apart yeah they talk about (23:55 - 23:59)
how like the soul (23:57 - 24:02)
or what the bottom part the thing you (23:59 - 24:03)
stand on (24:02 - 24:04)
the soul (24:03 - 24:06)
is made of a material and it starts to (24:04 - 24:08)
crumble (24:06 - 24:11)
even if you don't wear it (24:08 - 24:14)
and wearing it like puts pressure on it (24:11 - 24:16)
and like it like works it like a muscle (24:14 - 24:19)
in your body so then it actually stays (24:16 - 24:21)
together they compared it to like (24:19 - 24:22)
you (24:21 - 24:24)
like working out like you got to work (24:22 - 24:25)
out you got to keep working out (24:24 - 24:29)
otherwise your muscles go away (24:25 - 24:29)
and they were talking about how it packs (24:29 - 24:32)
the material and keeps the material (24:30 - 24:34)
flexible whereas if you don't (24:32 - 24:37)
it never compacts and just degrades (24:34 - 24:39)
correct yes being constantly compacted (24:37 - 24:42)
and worked that's what they said (24:39 - 24:43)
so they were like you might as well wear (24:42 - 24:44)
your shoes because otherwise they're (24:43 - 24:45)
just gonna fall apart sitting on your (24:44 - 24:46)
shelf (24:45 - 24:48)
it was really interesting and i was like (24:46 - 24:50)
again i was like thank goodness i'm not (24:48 - 24:53)
into shoe culture but if i was if i was (24:50 - 24:55)
like you know what i like these pokemon (24:53 - 24:56)
shoes (24:55 - 24:59)
let's let's be real i know you have (24:56 - 25:02)
waited in line for a phone (24:59 - 25:04)
yeah back in the day i did (25:02 - 25:08)
so let's uh that was when i was a a very (25:04 - 25:10)
apple fanboy (25:08 - 25:13)
i was a very bad apple fanboy (25:10 - 25:14)
yeah (25:13 - 25:16)
look i still use apple products i'm just (25:14 - 25:18)
not i just i just buy them with with (25:16 - 25:20)
this taste now i'm just very upset that (25:18 - 25:22)
i keep giving them keep giving apple (25:20 - 25:24)
money what is your reluctant apple (25:22 - 25:25)
fanboy (25:24 - 25:27)
what would you switch to (25:25 - 25:30)
like i can't switch i'm too deep into (25:27 - 25:32)
this ecosystem so like why would you (25:30 - 25:34)
have just taste about it like you made a (25:32 - 25:35)
choice (25:34 - 25:37)
you could come to peace with the fact (25:35 - 25:39)
that you bought into a system (25:37 - 25:42)
believe me i i have i have a galaxy (25:39 - 25:43)
phone (25:42 - 25:46)
in my house for work (25:43 - 25:49)
i literally don't know why people get (25:46 - 25:51)
all up in arms about which system you (25:49 - 25:56)
use like they're both bad (25:51 - 25:56)
if i was to collect any of these shoes (25:57 - 26:00)
though i would have probably got the (25:59 - 26:02)
kids shoes (26:00 - 26:05)
because they're like half the cost (26:02 - 26:07)
they're the same shoe they're just (26:05 - 26:09)
little they're like it's like uh (26:07 - 26:11)
it's it's like you know on pokemon cards (26:09 - 26:12)
you get the jumbo card and then you get (26:11 - 26:15)
the normal size card like i don't want (26:12 - 26:16)
the jumbo one because i'm not gonna do (26:15 - 26:18)
anything with it anyways are we really (26:16 - 26:20)
explaining the difference between kids (26:18 - 26:22)
shoes and adult shoes right now well (26:20 - 26:24)
that one is smaller than the other well (26:22 - 26:26)
yeah welcome to the show (26:24 - 26:28)
i would want to put the kids shoes on my (26:26 - 26:30)
shelf because they're like cute and like (26:28 - 26:32)
smaller and they're the same (26:30 - 26:33)
they're also the ones that were actually (26:32 - 26:37)
cuter the pokemon kids shoes with (26:33 - 26:39)
the little kids chucks are cute the (26:37 - 26:41)
little black one the with the pikachu (26:39 - 26:43)
tail in the back is is very cute (26:41 - 26:46)

special collections v-star glacion and (27:13 - 27:17)
v-star (27:15 - 27:19)
leafeon are ready to harness the power (27:17 - 27:20)
of grasonites to knock out their (27:19 - 27:23)
competition (27:20 - 27:24)
uh these (27:23 - 27:26)
these boxes (27:24 - 27:28)
will feature one promo card of leafeon v (27:26 - 27:31)
or glaceon v one etched promo card of (27:28 - 27:34)
leafeon v star or glaceon v star one uh (27:31 - 27:38)
etched oversized card one acrylic v-star (27:34 - 27:40)
marker and five booster packs which (27:38 - 27:41)
means that these will probably retail (27:40 - 27:43)
for 29.99 (27:41 - 27:47)
are we past the point where the booster (27:43 - 27:49)
packs that you hate would not be in this (27:47 - 27:51)
set (27:49 - 27:53)
no because we have walked into (27:51 - 27:56)
battle styles realm (27:53 - 27:58)
and battle styles is the crimson (27:56 - 28:03)
invasion of sort sword and shield (27:58 - 28:05)
crimson invasion properly named (28:03 - 28:08)
it's an invasion of bad cards that you (28:05 - 28:11)
would have to suffer through (28:08 - 28:13)
battle styles (28:11 - 28:15)
is the crimson (28:13 - 28:18)
okay here's the real question you hate (28:15 - 28:20)
you hate that you purchase apple but you (28:18 - 28:22)
never have anything good to say about (28:20 - 28:24)
pokemon cards no no there are some good (28:22 - 28:26)
cards there's some good cards you hate (28:24 - 28:28)
like most sets why do you play this game (28:26 - 28:31)
most most pokemon sets are bad (28:28 - 28:35)
vivid voltage is a good set (28:31 - 28:38)
fusion strike bad even though i just (28:35 - 28:40)
ordered a booster box of fusion strike (28:38 - 28:42)
for everybody at home (28:40 - 28:44)
what is your criteria for a good or bad (28:42 - 28:45)
set (28:44 - 28:47)
um (28:45 - 28:50)
uh i would say card count (28:47 - 28:54)
so the reason that fusion strike is bad (28:50 - 28:56)
is because it's the biggest set ever so (28:54 - 28:58)
it feels like you have just so much (28:56 - 28:59)
filler (28:58 - 29:01)
uh because it is it is it is nothing but (28:59 - 29:04)
filler so so ideally you want a bit of a (29:01 - 29:05)
smaller set (29:04 - 29:06)
and (29:05 - 29:09)
you want the cards in the set to be like (29:06 - 29:11)
sought after so the reason crimson (29:09 - 29:12)
invasion is bad (29:11 - 29:15)
is because the only card that is sought (29:12 - 29:18)
after was an energy card it was the i (29:15 - 29:19)
think it was either the ferry or the (29:18 - 29:21)
water energy it was a hollow version of (29:19 - 29:24)
that and that card itself ended up being (29:21 - 29:27)
at its peak around 40 dollars (29:24 - 29:30)
so when you bought if you bought (29:27 - 29:35)
36 packs of crimson invasion for 99 (29:30 - 29:35)
the most expensive card was 40 (29:36 - 29:41)
and also very hard to pull and the other (29:38 - 29:43)
cards you pull wouldn't even like come (29:41 - 29:47)
close to you getting your money back so (29:43 - 29:47)
that is all basement on resale (29:47 - 29:52)
it does it matter about playability (29:50 - 29:55)
where they're actually good format cards (29:52 - 29:57)
in there or does that not factor into (29:55 - 29:59)
the this is a good set this is a bad set (29:57 - 30:02)
because cards being good (29:59 - 30:04)
but that but the cards being good factor (30:02 - 30:06)
into resale value (30:04 - 30:09)
if a card is good it goes up in price (30:06 - 30:11)
because it's good to use (30:09 - 30:13)
so that kind of like plays like in (30:11 - 30:16)
battle styles i don't think there's like (30:13 - 30:18)
battle styles would be or she the (30:16 - 30:20)
hershey foods would be like okay but (30:18 - 30:21)
they're but they're not terribly (30:20 - 30:24)
expensive themselves because (30:21 - 30:26)
i i'm pretty sure they were like tinned (30:24 - 30:28)
by tind i mean like you just buy a box (30:26 - 30:29)
and it was like a promo on the box so it (30:28 - 30:30)
like (30:29 - 30:34)
decreases the price of it i think (30:30 - 30:35)
so i've been assuming that when you say (30:34 - 30:37)
a set is bad it's because it's bad to (30:35 - 30:40)
play but it's actually bad because the (30:37 - 30:43)
so is is a good card to play completely (30:40 - 30:45)
independent from a pretty card like are (30:43 - 30:46)
the pretty cards good to play or are (30:45 - 30:48)
those just unrelated to each other (30:46 - 30:51)
sometimes they're unrelated (30:48 - 30:52)
so like uh (30:51 - 30:54)
these are good questions so like (30:52 - 30:57)
charizard will always be (30:54 - 30:59)
charizard will always be a bad card to (30:57 - 31:00)
play (30:59 - 31:04)
but always will be an expensive card (31:00 - 31:06)
um the same with umbreon i don't know (31:04 - 31:08)
why but umbreon cards are always worth (31:06 - 31:09)
money (31:08 - 31:12)
and most of them are bad (31:09 - 31:14)
so when you say bad to play like it the (31:12 - 31:16)
abilities are bad it doesn't do enough (31:14 - 31:18)
it's (31:16 - 31:19)
too hard to set up (31:18 - 31:21)
yeah usually charizard cards are like (31:19 - 31:24)
five energy which is way too much (31:21 - 31:26)
and the move is in itself isn't even (31:24 - 31:27)
good (31:26 - 31:30)
okay like the like a lot of cards in the (31:27 - 31:32)
tcg that are good revolve around like (31:30 - 31:34)
two to three energy if you're asking for (31:32 - 31:36)
four energy holy cow it must be it (31:34 - 31:38)
better be one of the most incredible (31:36 - 31:39)
moves you're about to do if you're (31:38 - 31:40)
asking for four energy and if you're (31:39 - 31:42)
asking for five (31:40 - 31:43)
you better like instantly win the game (31:42 - 31:45)
when you put on that fifth energy like (31:43 - 31:47)
you are asking for a lot um but yeah a (31:45 - 31:51)
lot of a lot of moves will a lot of meta (31:47 - 31:52)
will revolve around like a two or a (31:51 - 31:54)
three energy move (31:52 - 31:56)
or ability but then there are also (31:54 - 31:58)
pokemon that always have similar (31:56 - 31:59)
abilities (31:58 - 32:03)
um no matter like whether the card is (31:59 - 32:04)
six months old or like 10 years old like (32:03 - 32:06)
vio plume almost always has the same (32:04 - 32:09)
ability which is like your no one can (32:06 - 32:10)
play items anymore (32:09 - 32:12)
which if your deck doesn't have items (32:10 - 32:14)
and you're building around that very (32:12 - 32:15)
good for you because it doesn't matter (32:14 - 32:17)
and very devastating to your opponent if (32:15 - 32:20)
their deck is very item based but yeah (32:17 - 32:22)
but violent garbage there (32:20 - 32:24)
always have some sort of ability that's (32:22 - 32:26)
like that (32:24 - 32:26)
um and then there's cards like mew (32:27 - 32:32)
and miu is always expensive because (32:30 - 32:35)
people like miu but mu is also always (32:32 - 32:37)
usually a very good card in the tcg so (32:35 - 32:38)
those two things just kind of stack (32:37 - 32:41)
together and most mew cards are (32:38 - 32:44)
40 60 dollars which sucks if you need (32:41 - 32:45)
like three mews in your deck and they're (32:44 - 32:48)
like 40 bucks each (32:45 - 32:49)
need (32:48 - 32:50)
need (32:49 - 32:52)
i think mew is one of the most dominant (32:50 - 32:53)
cards right now in the current what (32:52 - 32:56)
about rainbow full art (32:53 - 33:00)
uh rainbow full art is like (32:56 - 33:00)
oh peop some people love the rainbow and (33:00 - 33:04)
some people hate the rainbow like (33:03 - 33:07)
visually (33:04 - 33:07)
like i like the way the rainbow stuff (33:07 - 33:12)
looks some people anybody hate rainbows (33:09 - 33:13)
i don't know people some people just (33:12 - 33:15)
don't like the way it looks i mean so (33:13 - 33:16)
sometimes the rainbow cards will be (33:15 - 33:18)
worth more (33:16 - 33:19)
and sometimes it won't (33:18 - 33:22)
so just depends so (33:19 - 33:22)
okay so the people who don't like (33:23 - 33:28)
rainbows win out on one when the rainbow (33:25 - 33:33)
cards are worth less yeah yeah okay (33:28 - 33:33)
and then there are cards like (33:36 - 33:40)
trainer cards like let's say (33:38 - 33:42)
n (33:40 - 33:44)
n let's yeah because because you could (33:42 - 33:46)
you back in black and white you would (33:44 - 33:48)
always want four ends (33:46 - 33:50)
maybe if you were real feeling real (33:48 - 33:52)
risky you would only run three n's but (33:50 - 33:54)
you would want four so when they made (33:52 - 33:56)
full art n (33:54 - 33:58)
those cards were really expensive (33:56 - 33:59)
because (33:58 - 34:02)
you would put n in every deck so if you (33:59 - 34:05)
invested in four full art ends (34:02 - 34:07)
you're investing in like (34:05 - 34:10)
i can put these in all the decks i play (34:07 - 34:11)
and (34:10 - 34:14)
that causes the price to go up who first (34:11 - 34:15)
put this four (34:14 - 34:18)
four of one type in (34:15 - 34:20)
in a deck ruling because it comes it's (34:18 - 34:22)
up in a lot of (34:20 - 34:24)
card games (34:22 - 34:26)
why did they pick four (34:24 - 34:28)
is it yu-gi-oh (34:26 - 34:30)
three look i have no idea about that i (34:28 - 34:32)
do not want to risk my soul going to the (34:30 - 34:34)
shadow realm so i stay far away from (34:32 - 34:37)
yu-gi-oh (34:34 - 34:37)
they're the correct choice (34:38 - 34:41)
the only tcg deck i've ever played was (34:42 - 34:45)
uh me and my brother got these like (34:44 - 34:48)
world champion decks oh yeah when we (34:45 - 34:50)
played and i played one where the thing (34:48 - 34:52)
was like you had to discard like 8 (34:50 - 34:54)
million magikarps and then you like (34:52 - 34:56)
played a card that was like for every (34:54 - 34:58)
magikarp you discard you do an extra 10 (34:56 - 35:00)
damage or whatever um so i'm pretty sure (34:58 - 35:03)
that had like four magikarps and then i (35:00 - 35:05)
i came in and destroyed with my (35:03 - 35:07)
discarded magikarps what that was that (35:05 - 35:10)
sounds very familiar (35:07 - 35:14)
carp destruction is what we call it (35:10 - 35:14)
carpet to stop what (35:14 - 35:19)
you know so you know when the world (35:18 - 35:22)
champion people win they like get to (35:19 - 35:24)
name their deck so when you do buy those (35:22 - 35:26)
world championship decks those are like (35:24 - 35:28)
the name i should go find the name (35:26 - 35:30)
uh if it's not called carp destruction (35:28 - 35:32)
it should be (35:30 - 35:32)
all right well let's take a break (35:33 - 35:37)
and we'll come back we're so defeated (35:38 - 35:42)
and we're only halfway through the show (35:40 - 35:44)
i'm feeling very proud of this so far (35:42 - 35:47)
hey we have um (35:44 - 35:49)
some pokemon go news and we actually (35:47 - 35:50)
have some pokemon snap news to talk (35:49 - 35:52)
about so we will be (35:50 - 35:55)
right back (35:52 - 35:55)
i know pokemon people think they're like (35:55 - 35:58)
important or something oh hey look at (35:57 - 36:00)
that (35:58 - 36:01)
and it's far away (36:00 - 36:03)
uh (36:01 - 36:04)
that's really cool (36:03 - 36:07)
boom (36:04 - 36:07)
look at that bull i don't actually know (36:09 - 36:15)
if it's a boy or girl yet hold on (36:12 - 36:15)
oh yeah take a picture i always mess up (36:15 - 36:20)
it was here chat and we are back from (36:17 - 36:22)
our break (36:20 - 36:24)
hey let's talk about pokemon snap we (36:22 - 36:26)
haven't talked about that in like six (36:24 - 36:27)
months (36:26 - 36:30)
because it's a dead game (36:27 - 36:31)
i think yes (36:30 - 36:33)
just like pokemon tonight what do we (36:31 - 36:35)
need to talk about it happened it was a (36:33 - 36:37)
moment it was iconic we loved it and (36:35 - 36:40)
then we moved on with our lives (36:37 - 36:42)
uh brandon sent us in from our slack (36:40 - 36:44)
community in the uh attic channel here (36:42 - 36:48)
uh it's from nintendo life titled new (36:44 - 36:50)
pokemon snap took many years of trial (36:48 - 36:52)
and error core concept could have been (36:50 - 36:55)
changed (36:52 - 36:58)
and this was off a (36:55 - 37:02)
interview originally from famitsu (36:58 - 37:02)
so uh i guess we'll go over (37:04 - 37:08)
nintendo everything which who i think we (37:07 - 37:10)
talked about last week did the (37:08 - 37:11)
translation for some stuff they did the (37:10 - 37:13)
translation here which was the (37:11 - 37:16)
famitsu interview it came from the (37:13 - 37:20)
pokemon company's president ishihara (37:16 - 37:20)
ishihara said quote with the release of (37:20 - 37:25)
every new generations of console be it (37:22 - 37:27)
the gamecube or the wii we discussed (37:25 - 37:29)
making a sequel taking photos (37:27 - 37:32)
has become become something we do (37:29 - 37:35)
every day and its novelty isn't what it (37:32 - 37:36)
use (37:35 - 37:39)
used to be so uh it was it was difficult (37:36 - 37:41)
to concept a game around it there was a (37:39 - 37:42)
lot of debate on how the gimmick would (37:41 - 37:44)
work which made it difficult to start (37:42 - 37:46)
development (37:44 - 37:47)
the game was (37:46 - 37:49)
the fruits of many years of trial and (37:47 - 37:51)
error we finally found a concept that (37:49 - 37:53)
made sense and on the nintendo made (37:51 - 37:55)
sense on the nintendo switch and we made (37:53 - 37:56)
it (37:55 - 37:57)
in the same (37:56 - 37:59)
interview (37:57 - 38:01)
the game director suzuki (37:59 - 38:03)
mentioned after such a long time away it (38:01 - 38:05)
was considered a (38:03 - 38:08)
whether or not another pokemon (38:05 - 38:10)
was considered whether or not pokemon (38:08 - 38:12)
snap's core concept should be changed (38:10 - 38:14)
thankfully fans wanting more of the same (38:12 - 38:16)
they decided that the original games (38:14 - 38:19)
concept should return so suzuki says (38:16 - 38:20)
it's been more than 20 years since the (38:19 - 38:22)
nintendo 64 release of pokemon snap and (38:20 - 38:24)
the problems we faced of whether or not (38:22 - 38:26)
we should change the game's core concept (38:24 - 38:28)
uh (38:26 - 38:29)
it was a great opportunity for us (38:28 - 38:31)
reflecting on the game proved to be a (38:29 - 38:33)
big influence of development the more i (38:31 - 38:34)
heard about what happened during (38:33 - 38:36)
development of the last game it (38:34 - 38:37)
reaffirmed our decision to stick with (38:36 - 38:39)
the original games concept from there it (38:37 - 38:41)
was finding things within the core (38:39 - 38:43)
concept that we could expand on or (38:41 - 38:47)
better suit today's market (38:43 - 38:47)
it looks like you have something to say (38:50 - 38:55)
greg it's just that it's like (38:51 - 38:57)
nothing (38:55 - 38:59)
nothing statement (38:57 - 39:02)
i try to think of like (38:59 - 39:04)
it it's like saying well we could have (39:02 - 39:06)
changed the core concept we could we (39:04 - 39:08)
could be doing a different podcast right (39:06 - 39:09)
now (39:08 - 39:12)
but ultimately we didn't (39:09 - 39:14)
and there's no imagination (39:12 - 39:17)
what it could have been like (39:14 - 39:20)
okay (39:17 - 39:22)
yeah i think like me (39:20 - 39:25)
maybe i am just like an uncreative human (39:22 - 39:27)
but what what other core like if you (39:25 - 39:30)
change the core concept it wouldn't be a (39:27 - 39:33)
pokemon snap game (39:30 - 39:35)
really i don't know (39:33 - 39:37)
like what what what other core concept (39:35 - 39:38)
could you do other than like running (39:37 - 39:39)
around taking pictures of pokemon and (39:38 - 39:42)
have a pokemon snap game yeah i i fee (39:39 - 39:46)
this article just feels like (39:42 - 39:47)
i think the interesting piece is they (39:46 - 39:51)
thought about making a sequel (39:47 - 39:51)
for at every council turn i do think (39:52 - 39:57)
that's a fairly interesting like this (39:55 - 39:58)
could have been a long going series if (39:57 - 40:01)
they made one for every (39:58 - 40:04)
console but they sort of don't explain (40:01 - 40:06)
at least what we see here why they (40:04 - 40:07)
didn't (40:06 - 40:11)
and what about the switch (40:07 - 40:12)
made it (40:11 - 40:14)
like oh now now's (40:12 - 40:16)
now this engine is the one that we want (40:14 - 40:19)
to use (40:16 - 40:19)
i just wish there was more to this (40:20 - 40:23)
because it's just like okay yeah we (40:22 - 40:25)
thought about it we didn't do it and now (40:23 - 40:26)
we have a game (40:25 - 40:28)
okay bye (40:26 - 40:28)
yeah if i don't know if the interviewer (40:29 - 40:33)
just didn't press (40:32 - 40:35)
i i guess i don't know what the (40:33 - 40:37)
interviewer's main (40:35 - 40:40)
goal of interviewing about pokemon snap (40:37 - 40:42)
so far after the fact like what what was (40:40 - 40:44)
he fishing for like what was the story (40:42 - 40:46)
he was trying to get (40:44 - 40:47)
because (40:46 - 40:50)
if you're talking to ishihara (40:47 - 40:53)
president of the pokemon company (40:50 - 40:56)
he that is the hopefully ideally the guy (40:53 - 40:59)
that knows everything about pokemon in (40:56 - 41:01)
the sense of like (40:59 - 41:03)
what are we doing this year for our (41:01 - 41:04)
franchise (41:03 - 41:07)
like we know that we've made a pokemon (41:04 - 41:08)
dash has that been brought up on the (41:07 - 41:10)
table are we making a sequel to pokemon (41:08 - 41:12)
dash are we making a sequel to puzzle (41:10 - 41:13)
league are we making a sequel to snap (41:12 - 41:15)
are we making a sequel to conquest are (41:13 - 41:17)
we making a are are we (41:15 - 41:19)
are we doing brilliant diamond shining (41:17 - 41:21)
pearl or are we doing (41:19 - 41:23)
significantly better platinum like what (41:21 - 41:27)
like i am i'm assuming that he has (41:23 - 41:30)
some say (41:27 - 41:30)
but not to the point where he's like (41:30 - 41:35)
hey are you removing hms from this game (41:33 - 41:37)
like i i don't think that's what he's (41:35 - 41:40)
doing but i i can't imagine he (41:37 - 41:44)
hasn't in 20 some years thought (41:40 - 41:47)
about pokemon snap (41:44 - 41:49)
like every single year (41:47 - 41:50)
yeah (41:49 - 41:52)
i mean so i click through to nintendo (41:50 - 41:53)
everything and they have (41:52 - 41:55)
more from the interview which i think is (41:53 - 41:57)
actually more interesting (41:55 - 41:58)
so (41:57 - 42:00)
uh one of the things they said you know (41:58 - 42:02)
were they worried about handing it over (42:00 - 42:05)
to bandai namco and they said (42:02 - 42:07)
they had really high hopes (42:05 - 42:08)
that the team would create a new pokemon (42:07 - 42:10)
stop because pokken itself was a great (42:08 - 42:12)
achievement uh and they were floored by (42:10 - 42:13)
the amount of detail that they put in (42:12 - 42:16)
the game's background and scenery uh (42:13 - 42:18)
they questioned whether the volume of (42:16 - 42:20)
pokemon and background detail that they (42:18 - 42:22)
included in vocab pokemon was even (42:20 - 42:24)
necessary as it was completely unrelated (42:22 - 42:26)
to the core gameplay but sometimes when (42:24 - 42:27)
playing they'd get attacked while their (42:26 - 42:29)
eyes were in the background and they (42:27 - 42:31)
were wondering if that was intentional (42:29 - 42:33)
and also (42:31 - 42:35)
famitsu asked ishahara if they put any (42:33 - 42:37)
requests while new pokemon snap was in (42:35 - 42:39)
development in isha hara himself that he (42:37 - 42:42)
said he rarely gave the team any (42:39 - 42:44)
specifics so i think that detail is (42:42 - 42:46)
really interesting that they really said (42:44 - 42:48)
we trust the background and the detail (42:46 - 42:50)
that you made in pokken so we are (42:48 - 42:52)
trusting you to make (42:50 - 42:54)
a gorgeous (42:52 - 42:56)
snap game and they really it from this (42:54 - 42:58)
at least seems like they were really (42:56 - 43:00)
fairly hands off of to what that looked (42:58 - 43:01)
like (43:00 - 43:03)
i think that's a fairly interesting (43:01 - 43:05)
thing i still wish i would know why they (43:03 - 43:06)
felt (43:05 - 43:08)
the switch was (43:06 - 43:11)
now the council to do it yeah (43:08 - 43:14)
i just because maybe the switch sold (43:11 - 43:16)
incredibly well i mean the wii sold (43:14 - 43:18)
incredibly well (43:16 - 43:22)
did was the hesitation like (43:18 - 43:22)
no one wanted to make a snap game with (43:22 - 43:25)
motion controls because that was the (43:24 - 43:27)
thing you heard during the wii is like (43:25 - 43:28)
everyone's like oh the wii is the (43:27 - 43:30)
perfect console for snap because you can (43:28 - 43:32)
look around and it's like yeah i guess (43:30 - 43:34)
yeah i think probably motion controls (43:32 - 43:35)
like (43:34 - 43:38)
put into question like (43:35 - 43:40)
what would be interesting with motion (43:38 - 43:41)
controls (43:40 - 43:43)
for this because (43:41 - 43:45)
a lot of those motion controls weren't (43:43 - 43:47)
intuitive and the way snap plays you (43:45 - 43:49)
were spinning around (43:47 - 43:51)
a lot so did we have to like move away (43:49 - 43:52)
from the screen (43:51 - 43:55)
to switch the i i think that would be (43:52 - 43:58)
more problematic than the switch (43:55 - 44:01)
would with better graphics (43:58 - 44:01)
i don't doubt that the game was like (44:03 - 44:07)
difficult to make in the sense of how do (44:08 - 44:12)
we make (44:10 - 44:15)
a what is ultimately a six hour game on (44:12 - 44:19)
the nintendo 64 that was (44:15 - 44:19)
a rental for a lot of people like it was (44:20 - 44:23)
the (44:22 - 44:25)
go to blockbuster on friday night rent (44:23 - 44:27)
snap for the weekend returned it on (44:25 - 44:29)
monday have a great time (44:27 - 44:31)
a month later forget about it and then (44:29 - 44:33)
wanting to do that experience again (44:31 - 44:35)
um (44:33 - 44:36)
and we were all we were all wrong in (44:35 - 44:38)
like is this going to be another (44:36 - 44:40)
six-hour game and it ended up being (44:38 - 44:42)
a very (44:40 - 44:45)
long game if you were a completionist (44:42 - 44:48)
or if you like to look for secrets (44:45 - 44:50)
and it was a very (44:48 - 44:51)
i think (44:50 - 44:53)
good price (44:51 - 44:55)
good time slash price investment for (44:53 - 44:56)
your money even if you just went through (44:55 - 44:58)
it once i i do think there was a lot of (44:56 - 45:00)
value there (44:58 - 45:02)
um (45:00 - 45:02)
they are correct in the sense of like (45:02 - 45:08)
photography has changed like everyone (45:05 - 45:10)
has a camera now (45:08 - 45:13)
back in the when pokemon snap came out (45:10 - 45:14)
it was like (45:13 - 45:16)
here's a disposable camera for your (45:14 - 45:18)
birthday treasure these 20 photos you (45:16 - 45:21)
can take and mom and dad are never going (45:18 - 45:23)
to get them developed because that costs (45:21 - 45:25)
money too and that costs time to go and (45:23 - 45:27)
it's like (45:25 - 45:29)
i mean i would say access to photography (45:27 - 45:30)
is (45:29 - 45:33)
is easier nowadays photography is more (45:30 - 45:35)
accessible now than it was (45:33 - 45:36)
uh (45:35 - 45:38)
good photography is still as (45:36 - 45:42)
inaccessible as it was (45:38 - 45:42)
i don't know what changes they would (45:45 - 45:50)
have made though like what was (45:46 - 45:50)
like pengu said if you change the core (45:50 - 45:55)
concept then it's no longer snap (45:52 - 45:57)
i mean so i'm wondering if (45:55 - 46:00)
maybe they're like (45:57 - 46:02)
the car concept would be you would still (46:00 - 46:04)
like a change of car accounts would be (46:02 - 46:06)
you would go out and you would capture (46:04 - 46:08)
pokemon and then you would bring them (46:06 - 46:11)
back to a studio ranch type situation (46:08 - 46:12)
and then (46:11 - 46:14)
create scenes and (46:12 - 46:16)
you know tableaus for photography so (46:14 - 46:19)
it'd be less of so it'd be like harvey's (46:16 - 46:20)
island in animal crossing but with (46:19 - 46:23)
pokemon (46:20 - 46:23)
harvey's island was never interesting to (46:25 - 46:28)
me (46:26 - 46:31)
i'm uncreative and bad at designing so i (46:28 - 46:32)
never did that (46:31 - 46:34)
this is why i stopped playing animal (46:32 - 46:36)
crossing because i saw other people be (46:34 - 46:38)
so creative and so good and it made me (46:36 - 46:41)
self-conscious of like (46:38 - 46:44)
oh i i can't i can't do that why am i (46:41 - 46:47)
i'm a failure yourself (46:44 - 46:49)
my island sucks compared to your island (46:47 - 46:51)
so i might as well just give up on life (46:49 - 46:53)
your island was a unique unique (46:51 - 46:55)
expression of you (46:53 - 46:57)
and you should be proud of the hot mess (46:55 - 47:00)
you created hmm (46:57 - 47:00)
page of the subreddit (47:00 - 47:05)
that's true i was front page of crappy (47:02 - 47:07)
animal crossing our slash crappy animal (47:05 - 47:09)
crossing (47:07 - 47:09)
forever living (47:10 - 47:14)
infamy there (47:12 - 47:14)
i wonder if new pokemon snap will be (47:16 - 47:22)
looked on as an incredible game (47:19 - 47:26)
as pokemon snap has 20 years later (47:22 - 47:28)
because i do (47:26 - 47:31)
i genuinely genuinely believe that new (47:28 - 47:32)
pokemon snap (47:31 - 47:33)
is (47:32 - 47:36)
a perfect sequel it does everything (47:33 - 47:38)
better (47:36 - 47:40)
and you lose nothing to the point where (47:38 - 47:42)
you're like man (47:40 - 47:43)
i wish they did this like they did in (47:42 - 47:45)
the original (47:43 - 47:46)
with one exception i will say one (47:45 - 47:48)
exception they don't have the like you (47:46 - 47:50)
are close that's like maybe the one (47:48 - 47:51)
except (47:50 - 47:53)
one like if it had that it would be (47:51 - 47:55)
actually like 11 out of 10 perfect the (47:53 - 47:58)
only thing i would say the only thing (47:55 - 48:00)
why i don't think it will stand out as (47:58 - 48:01)
much as the original is that the (48:00 - 48:04)
original (48:01 - 48:07)
felt (48:04 - 48:07)
knew in the way like you didn't have (48:08 - 48:12)
access to this (48:10 - 48:15)
and it was a thing to go to blockbuster (48:12 - 48:16)
and (48:15 - 48:19)
print things out like there was a whole (48:16 - 48:21)
sort of weird culture (48:19 - 48:23)
that was around it that was very novel (48:21 - 48:25)
to that game (48:23 - 48:28)
and i don't think (48:25 - 48:28)
pokemon snap (48:28 - 48:33)
the new pokemon snap brings a level of (48:31 - 48:36)
novelty that people will remember it 20 (48:33 - 48:38)
years later like there wasn't like (48:36 - 48:40)
we aren't talking about going to (48:38 - 48:43)
blockbuster to print pictures out with (48:40 - 48:46)
new pokemon snap we aren't talking about (48:43 - 48:48)
what an experience it was to rent it for (48:46 - 48:49)
the weekend and you get all your things (48:48 - 48:52)
and beg your parents to do these things (48:49 - 48:55)
that doesn't exist with this game (48:52 - 48:57)
and i don't think (48:55 - 48:58)
that (48:57 - 49:01)
it has enough uniqueness that people (48:58 - 49:05)
will be talking about it being like (49:01 - 49:06)
a perfect (49:05 - 49:07)
game (49:06 - 49:10)
20 years from now it's a very good game (49:07 - 49:12)
but i don't think it has enough (49:10 - 49:15)
uniqueness about it to sort of have a (49:12 - 49:18)
ton of legs to a lot of people (49:15 - 49:18)
and also it was rare to see pokemon in (49:24 - 49:28)
the wild and in 3d (49:26 - 49:31)
and it is pretty common (49:28 - 49:33)
now yeah you know (49:31 - 49:35)
which those are probably things they (49:33 - 49:36)
thought about (49:35 - 49:38)
yeah (49:36 - 49:40)
it's like the whole (49:38 - 49:41)
you know in interviews they said like we (49:40 - 49:43)
have no desire to do a stadium because (49:41 - 49:45)
the whole point of stadium was to see (49:43 - 49:47)
pokemon in 3d battling and (49:45 - 49:50)
we have that now (49:47 - 49:50)
so (49:50 - 49:54)
um (49:52 - 49:55)
all right to shift gears a little bit (49:54 - 49:57)
niantic did something weird (49:55 - 49:58)
uh (49:57 - 50:00)
they're (49:58 - 50:04)
doing what is called a classic community (50:00 - 50:06)
uh which at first i thought (50:04 - 50:08)
oh they already did two charmander (50:06 - 50:10)
communities this would be the second (50:08 - 50:13)
bubble store that's not that weird (50:10 - 50:15)
but we're getting two communion days (50:13 - 50:17)
this month (50:15 - 50:17)
uh wait what is this feels this month (50:17 - 50:20)
right yeah (50:19 - 50:24)
this feel is this upcoming weekend (50:20 - 50:26)
i thought it was the 16th is that this (50:24 - 50:29)
upcoming weekend 16th yes 16th (50:26 - 50:32)
this upcoming weekend and then bulbasaur (50:29 - 50:36)
will be the 22nd yep (50:32 - 50:40)
uh so (50:36 - 50:40)
as a special treat we'll be holding a (50:40 - 50:44)
community day classic (50:42 - 50:47)
bringing back a favorite bulbasaur (50:44 - 50:49)
it will have the frenzy plant special (50:47 - 50:51)
move it will have the community research (50:49 - 50:53)
story so for a dollar you'll get a story (50:51 - 50:55)
on it (50:53 - 50:56)
um (50:55 - 50:58)
i think it's the same story that was (50:56 - 50:59)
original (50:58 - 51:00)
i don't remember if they had stories (50:59 - 51:02)
when bulbasaur came out i have no idea i (51:00 - 51:04)
didn't do it it's just a dollar though (51:02 - 51:05)
so i don't (51:04 - 51:08)
yeah three times the catch uh xp (51:05 - 51:10)
incense for three hours snapshots lower (51:08 - 51:12)
modules will um last for three hours (51:10 - 51:15)
there will be the scam box as always for (51:12 - 51:18)
12 180 poke coins you'll get 50 ultra (51:15 - 51:20)
balls five lucky eggs five star pieces (51:18 - 51:21)
elite charge tm (51:20 - 51:23)
30 ultra balls will be available in the (51:21 - 51:26)
shop at no cost (51:23 - 51:26)
i think it's also interesting to note (51:27 - 51:31)
that it's a shorter time (51:29 - 51:33)
oh yeah this is the the specifically (51:31 - 51:36)
three hours again this is the first (51:33 - 51:38)
three hour community day since the (51:36 - 51:41)
pandemic started (51:38 - 51:41)
kitty he's like i'm done with this (51:44 - 51:48)
podcast (51:46 - 51:48)
he wanted in then he wanted out (51:49 - 51:53)
just like a cat (51:51 - 51:56)
um is this their way of getting it back (51:53 - 52:00)
to three hours do they care about that (51:56 - 52:03)
i wonder if by them moving it to six (52:00 - 52:04)
hours they were like oh we made more (52:03 - 52:07)
money because it's longer (52:04 - 52:08)
but if that was the case then why would (52:07 - 52:10)
they not have this be six hours (52:08 - 52:14)
i'm curious about the decision and i i (52:10 - 52:18)
i'm still burned by the distance change (52:14 - 52:21)
so if this is like a test to go back to (52:18 - 52:23)
three hours (52:21 - 52:23)
please have learned from before (52:24 - 52:29)
it is a problem (52:27 - 52:31)
for nobody but you and you do not need (52:29 - 52:33)
to come up with a fix (52:31 - 52:36)
to me it reads as like faithful remake (52:33 - 52:38)
we're going back to classics so like (52:36 - 52:40)
we're going back to bulbasaur and also (52:38 - 52:43)
faithfully remaking the three-hour (52:40 - 52:45)
community day it worked so well with (52:43 - 52:46)
brilliant diamond shining pro we decided (52:45 - 52:50)
to ruin this game too (52:46 - 52:50)
is it like we're doing three hours (52:50 - 52:55)
because now we're giving you two a month (52:53 - 52:56)
instead of (52:55 - 52:58)
one a month like (52:56 - 53:00)
it it does (52:58 - 53:04)
the time itself does (53:00 - 53:06)
seem weird like that was obviously a (53:04 - 53:08)
conversation that people had (53:06 - 53:11)
and then you look at the the things they (53:08 - 53:13)
did in pikmin bloom which is a niantic (53:11 - 53:15)
game obviously a different team like (53:13 - 53:17)
niantic has multiple teams they have (53:15 - 53:19)
like their transformer team they who (53:17 - 53:20)
knows what's happening with their harry (53:19 - 53:21)
potter team (53:20 - 53:22)
they have their pikmin team they have (53:21 - 53:24)
this team (53:22 - 53:26)
and the the first pikmin community what (53:24 - 53:28)
it was like 12 hours long right it was (53:26 - 53:30)
like yeah or it was 10 it was like from (53:28 - 53:33)
10 no it was it was 10 a.m to 10 p.m (53:30 - 53:34)
right yeah something like that it was 12 (53:33 - 53:36)
hours and then there was issues in new (53:34 - 53:38)
zealand so (53:36 - 53:40)
classic niantic messing up new zealand (53:38 - 53:41)
for every game they do (53:40 - 53:43)
um thank you to everyone who lives in (53:41 - 53:45)
new zealand to suffer for the rest of (53:43 - 53:46)
the world (53:45 - 53:48)
you're appreciated canary in the coal (53:46 - 53:49)
mine (53:48 - 53:51)
um (53:49 - 53:52)
and then the next community today they (53:51 - 53:55)
were just like it's all it's just 24 (53:52 - 53:58)
hours it's just the full day (53:55 - 53:58)
and there's part of me that's like (53:59 - 54:04)
i'll just make it 24 hours so as many (54:02 - 54:06)
people can play (54:04 - 54:10)
but then the other part of me is like (54:06 - 54:10)
i like that they force (54:10 - 54:14)
players to play at the same time because (54:12 - 54:18)
then you do get that sense of community (54:14 - 54:22)
you do see all the people at the park (54:18 - 54:24)
at the same time because there is a (54:22 - 54:26)
window that they need to play in (54:24 - 54:29)
whereas with the six hour ones and maybe (54:26 - 54:31)
it's just because you know people play (54:29 - 54:32)
pogo differently since the pandemic but (54:31 - 54:35)
with the six hour ones it does (54:32 - 54:36)
seem (54:35 - 54:39)
that the parks are a bit emptier that it (54:36 - 54:41)
doesn't seem like raids fill up as fast (54:39 - 54:43)
because it is so spread out right i can (54:41 - 54:46)
start at i normally start my community (54:43 - 54:47)
an hour in right because i had six hours (54:46 - 54:49)
now so i usually miss the first hour (54:47 - 54:50)
because i'm (54:49 - 54:53)
um i look i like the longer i like the (54:50 - 54:54)
longer days i was telling i was talking (54:53 - 54:55)
to a friend about this you know when it (54:54 - 54:58)
was three hours and i was playing with (54:55 - 55:00)
my old group of friends it would be (54:58 - 55:02)
we we all woke up late commute day (55:00 - 55:05)
starting now go to the park no time to (55:02 - 55:07)
stop no time to eat we only have three (55:05 - 55:09)
hours and then when it's done (55:07 - 55:12)
we eat and that's fine but the six hours (55:09 - 55:13)
it's like (55:12 - 55:15)
not that big of a deal we missed the (55:13 - 55:16)
first hour it's okay we got five hours (55:15 - 55:19)
left okay we played for an hour and a (55:16 - 55:21)
half hey why don't we (55:19 - 55:24)
grab something small and sit down or hey (55:21 - 55:25)
why don't we you know drive to a (55:24 - 55:26)
different location because we have the (55:25 - 55:28)
time to drive (55:26 - 55:32)
okay cool we got 30 duskulls (55:28 - 55:33)
why don't do we need to play for the (55:32 - 55:36)
remaining 90 minutes no like let's just (55:33 - 55:39)
go home like it's just it does feel more (55:36 - 55:42)
relaxed and more like an actual event (55:39 - 55:43)
versus (55:42 - 55:45)
go go go go for three hours because (55:43 - 55:47)
we're out of time limit (55:45 - 55:50)
um i i (55:47 - 55:53)
the sense of community is is a rough (55:50 - 55:54)
sell for me (55:53 - 55:56)
given (55:54 - 55:58)
given the fact that the world (55:56 - 56:00)
is still not in a great spot (55:58 - 56:03)
um so to be like (56:00 - 56:06)
we need more people to cram into spaces (56:03 - 56:11)
for three hours is not an ideal (56:06 - 56:14)
situation like (56:11 - 56:17)
i don't i don't understa again this is (56:14 - 56:19)
this this the distant thing i don't (56:17 - 56:21)
understand (56:19 - 56:24)
what the reasoning would be (56:21 - 56:25)
to (56:24 - 56:28)
go back to a worse experience (56:25 - 56:31)
because the world has not been better (56:28 - 56:33)
and (56:31 - 56:33)
everything's gonna vary like (56:33 - 56:38)
particularly (56:36 - 56:41)
in cold climbs we're all (56:38 - 56:44)
indoors doing this which is not ideal (56:41 - 56:46)
for large groups of people to be forced (56:44 - 56:49)
together for a shorter amount of time (56:46 - 56:51)
uh i i still think (56:49 - 56:54)
like and if you say oh it's the hardcore (56:51 - 56:55)
players like the hardcore players play (56:54 - 56:57)
all six hours (56:55 - 56:59)
yeah (56:57 - 57:01)
you're really making it harder for the (56:59 - 57:04)
casual players (57:01 - 57:04)
which (57:04 - 57:08)
granted is often not (57:05 - 57:11)
the first (57:08 - 57:11)
thought of most companies because casual (57:11 - 57:14)
players don't pay you as much money as (57:12 - 57:16)
hardcore do but (57:14 - 57:18)
even in a hardcore situation hardcore (57:16 - 57:20)
players still play for the six hours (57:18 - 57:22)
like they are interacting with your game (57:20 - 57:25)
for that entire time so i'm not seeing (57:22 - 57:28)
the benefits (57:25 - 57:33)
behind a shorter time period other than (57:28 - 57:33)
the only thing i can sort of think is we (57:33 - 57:38)
already took up six hours of your time (57:35 - 57:40)
we're gonna do another one (57:38 - 57:43)
so we're just gonna shorten it so we (57:40 - 57:46)
aren't eating up so much of your time (57:43 - 57:48)
and that that i'm slightly okay with (57:46 - 57:50)
because there's two and it is a makeup (57:48 - 57:53)
event like if this was like if we find (57:50 - 57:55)
out in february the main community today (57:53 - 57:57)
is only not going to be three hours (57:55 - 58:00)
that's going to be a problem for me but (57:57 - 58:01)
i think (58:00 - 58:04)
given the fact that it's a repeat is the (58:01 - 58:05)
second one (58:04 - 58:07)
in the month it's the second one (58:05 - 58:09)
and almost a week (58:07 - 58:10)
like (58:09 - 58:13)
while i think the decision is weird (58:10 - 58:15)
i also can kind of see the thought (58:13 - 58:17)
process of (58:15 - 58:19)
you don't have to do it we're putting it (58:17 - 58:20)
out as a special thing and we're just (58:19 - 58:23)
gonna keep it shorter so that if you (58:20 - 58:26)
as a hardcore person do want to do it we (58:23 - 58:29)
aren't monopolizing more of your time (58:26 - 58:29)
yeah to me it seems like a combination (58:31 - 58:35)
of the we're going to like (58:33 - 58:38)
go go really back to classic faithful (58:35 - 58:40)
remake and do the thing and also like (58:38 - 58:42)
it's uh being treated as a separate (58:40 - 58:44)
bonus thing rather than a community day (58:42 - 58:48)
in and of itself um which (58:44 - 58:49)
kind of makes sense to me i guess (58:48 - 58:51)
although i have never done a three-day (58:49 - 58:52)
community day because i only started (58:51 - 58:55)
playing pogo about a year ago so i don't (58:52 - 58:56)
really (58:55 - 58:58)
have the experience to judge between (58:56 - 59:00)
them (58:58 - 59:02)
i'm just also shocked that this is just (59:00 - 59:05)
not february's community or march is (59:02 - 59:06)
community like (59:05 - 59:08)
they (59:06 - 59:10)
they repeated charmander (59:08 - 59:12)
charmander obviously an incredibly (59:10 - 59:14)
popular pokemon bulbasaur just as (59:12 - 59:16)
popular (59:14 - 59:18)
and to all the hardcore people that (59:16 - 59:21)
complain (59:18 - 59:23)
that's fine (59:21 - 59:24)
like (59:23 - 59:26)
like there's such a small (59:24 - 59:27)
part (59:26 - 59:28)
of (59:27 - 59:30)
like they com they complained about (59:28 - 59:34)
roselia right and they complained about (59:30 - 59:35)
anything that wasn't gibbel and then (59:34 - 59:37)
when we got kibble they still complained (59:35 - 59:40)
because they spent (59:37 - 59:42)
all that money on raid passes during go (59:40 - 59:43)
fest (59:42 - 59:44)
and then they all complained that their (59:43 - 59:46)
gimbals were worthless or whatever that (59:44 - 59:47)
means (59:46 - 59:48)
and (59:47 - 59:51)
the same thing will happen with dino (59:48 - 59:54)
they did dino in go fest (59:51 - 59:57)
people paid dollars on top of dollars to (59:54 - 59:58)
get dino (59:57 - 60:01)
there will in ed there will eventually (59:58 - 60:04)
be a dino community (60:01 - 60:06)
and those people will complain right (60:04 - 60:09)
like like you don't really win (60:06 - 60:12)
with the hardcore players they will they (60:09 - 60:14)
it's just like me with apple products (60:12 - 60:16)
i'm going to buy the next iphone i'm (60:14 - 60:19)
going to complain about it it's fine (60:16 - 60:22)
uh (60:19 - 60:23)
but they (60:22 - 60:26)
but niantic will (60:23 - 60:28)
eventually run out of pokemon here right (60:26 - 60:31)
like this like the the problem isn't (60:28 - 60:34)
what happens when niantic runs out of (60:31 - 60:36)
pokemon that is not the problem (60:34 - 60:38)
people continue to play this game and (60:36 - 60:40)
have continued to play this game every (60:38 - 60:42)
day and what was the last new pokemon we (60:40 - 60:45)
got uh (60:42 - 60:45)
the berg bergmite yeah we just got (60:46 - 60:50)
bergman (60:48 - 60:51)
there was not a flood of people being (60:50 - 60:53)
like i haven't touched the game in two (60:51 - 60:55)
years bergmite is here holy like that (60:53 - 60:58)
doesn't that's it that didn't happen (60:55 - 60:59)
well there were some there were a couple (60:58 - 61:02)
but not like there wasn't a majority by (60:59 - 61:04)
any means soul out there who hasn't (61:02 - 61:06)
played pogo in two plus years that came (61:04 - 61:09)
back because bergmite was added there's (61:06 - 61:11)
at least two (61:09 - 61:13)
and they're not listening to the show i (61:11 - 61:15)
disagree (61:13 - 61:15)
bulbasaur hasn't been a community in (61:20 - 61:24)
what three plus years (61:22 - 61:26)
so in my head (61:24 - 61:30)
like dude are we gonna count canto tour (61:26 - 61:30)
no (61:32 - 61:35)
because that wasn't one like communities (61:33 - 61:38)
are one in 25 and specifically one (61:35 - 61:39)
pokemon like yes you could have gotten a (61:38 - 61:41)
shot in bubble store through canter tour (61:39 - 61:43)
but that was what did people say that (61:41 - 61:46)
was like one in a hundred and twenty and (61:43 - 61:49)
there was so many other pokemon spawning (61:46 - 61:51)
like like to me it just makes sense that (61:49 - 61:53)
eventually niantic will (61:51 - 61:56)
repeat events because you see that in (61:53 - 61:58)
mmos you just see that in like final (61:56 - 62:00)
fantasy here's an event (61:58 - 62:01)
the last time this event was was two (62:00 - 62:03)
years ago (62:01 - 62:04)
and you don't really at least when i (62:03 - 62:06)
played final fantasy 14 people weren't (62:04 - 62:08)
really ever upset they were just like (62:06 - 62:09)
yeah it's been two years i was missing (62:08 - 62:12)
one thing or like cool i can take this (62:09 - 62:14)
weekend off but (62:12 - 62:15)
sally (62:14 - 62:17)
gene over here who just started playing (62:15 - 62:19)
like i i'll help her get the the the (62:17 - 62:22)
mount that is coming back i mean i think (62:19 - 62:26)
one of the differences in those are (62:22 - 62:29)
mmos tend to run them for a week (62:26 - 62:30)
and (62:29 - 62:33)
generally they don't have to be (62:30 - 62:36)
completed like within a set time period (62:33 - 62:37)
like only three hours where you have to (62:36 - 62:39)
log in like they do repeat events but (62:37 - 62:41)
they're usually (62:39 - 62:44)
over a period of time i think (62:41 - 62:46)
niantic is unique in the fact that they (62:44 - 62:49)
have a very limited window (62:46 - 62:52)
and you tend to have to go out of your (62:49 - 62:54)
way to go to places where they spawn a (62:52 - 62:56)
lot or (62:54 - 62:58)
specifically do incense at home it is it (62:56 - 63:01)
is slightly different in (62:58 - 63:03)
niantic does demand a little bit more (63:01 - 63:06)
effort and time from you than like a (63:03 - 63:10)
week-long mmo and it can be done (63:06 - 63:11)
while you're playing the game normally (63:10 - 63:12)
right (63:11 - 63:14)
like if it was community today for a (63:12 - 63:16)
week and while you're playing the game (63:14 - 63:18)
you'll run into bubble sore more often (63:16 - 63:20)
and bubble sure will be shiny more often (63:18 - 63:22)
that's a very different experience and (63:20 - 63:25)
we're giving you a three hour window (63:22 - 63:25)
so we're like five years into pogo (63:29 - 63:34)
they want this to be (63:32 - 63:37)
a forever game (63:34 - 63:37)
and if you just look at what else they (63:38 - 63:42)
have you know you have (63:40 - 63:44)
the three starters for gen six the three (63:42 - 63:46)
starters for gen seven the three (63:44 - 63:47)
starters for gen eight (63:46 - 63:52)
that's nine community days pre-planned (63:47 - 63:53)
and then (63:52 - 63:56)
you have dino you have jang mao (63:53 - 64:00)
you have uh (63:56 - 64:00)
what was the gents you have gumi (64:00 - 64:07)
you have dragopalts like those are your (64:04 - 64:08)
pseudo dragons that will follow that (64:07 - 64:10)
pattern (64:08 - 64:13)
and then you have the eventual litwick (64:10 - 64:17)
you have probably the eventual (64:13 - 64:20)
what is the bird from jen (64:17 - 64:22)
seven oh that was (64:20 - 64:23)
pika peck (64:22 - 64:27)
yeah probably yep (64:23 - 64:29)
like well like in in in a month we're (64:27 - 64:33)
going to have all gen 2 pokemon be shiny (64:29 - 64:35)
so you could i (64:33 - 64:37)
i don't know do a gen 2 pokemon but then (64:35 - 64:40)
people are gonna complain like roselia (64:37 - 64:42)
you know roselia had that like (64:40 - 64:46)
safari zone experience (64:42 - 64:46)
it it's it's like i would challenge (64:49 - 64:55)
somebody to try to plan out two years of (64:51 - 64:58)
community day like to like plan out 24 (64:55 - 64:59)
communities (64:58 - 65:01)
and see if you can do it because you're (64:59 - 65:04)
gonna you're gonna discover very quickly (65:01 - 65:07)
there's not enough pokemon (65:04 - 65:08)
and you're going to have to either (65:07 - 65:10)
repeat events (65:08 - 65:12)
or you're going to have to do what they (65:10 - 65:14)
did with roselia was like yep this has (65:12 - 65:15)
already been shiny but you know we're (65:14 - 65:17)
going to dedicate a day to it which i (65:15 - 65:19)
personally think is fine like it's it's (65:17 - 65:21)
okay it's the best community day they've (65:19 - 65:25)
ever had before and since (65:21 - 65:25)
so it is just a little weird to me that (65:27 - 65:30)
they're like okay now we're doing two (65:29 - 65:32)
communities maybe this is an exception (65:30 - 65:34)
maybe this is just build up to (65:32 - 65:37)
maybe this isn't every month but like i (65:34 - 65:38)
again i could just see it where they (65:37 - 65:40)
just do bulbasaur four hey bulbasaurus (65:38 - 65:42)
march (65:40 - 65:43)
sorry it's a repeat you'll get something (65:42 - 65:45)
new and exciting for april (65:43 - 65:48)
but again i think repeats are okay too i (65:45 - 65:52)
feel like this is a test to see how (65:48 - 65:54)
people will handle (65:52 - 65:59)
two community days in a month (65:54 - 66:01)
given that one is a repeat (65:59 - 66:03)
i (66:01 - 66:05)
would bet money (66:03 - 66:06)
that the bulbasaur community would be (66:05 - 66:08)
more popular than this feel because it's (66:06 - 66:11)
bubble sore and it's gen one (66:08 - 66:11)
even though it's a repeat the only thing (66:12 - 66:16)
that bothers me is that um (66:14 - 66:19)
is that charmander had two and bulbasaur (66:16 - 66:20)
is having this one and it's not (66:19 - 66:22)
consistent and i i like things to be (66:20 - 66:26)
consistent and the same and it annoys me (66:22 - 66:27)
that it is not (66:26 - 66:29)
patterned (66:27 - 66:30)
well technically the first charmander (66:29 - 66:33)
was three the second charmander was (66:30 - 66:36)
six right (66:33 - 66:36)
yeah the second charmander was six but (66:37 - 66:41)
the second charmander was voted upon (66:39 - 66:43)
right it was like diglett zubat (66:41 - 66:45)
charmander oh yeah yeah (66:43 - 66:47)
dratini or something yeah that vote (66:45 - 66:49)
process that made me some man (66:47 - 66:51)
okay but then that means that then that (66:49 - 66:52)
was its own thing which means that they (66:51 - 66:54)
would have to do another back to classic (66:52 - 66:55)
for charmander and then that would be a (66:54 - 66:58)
third charmander yeah back to classic (66:55 - 66:59)
for squirtle (66:58 - 67:02)
it's just it's so i mean since it is the (66:59 - 67:04)
heritage season of heritage which is (67:02 - 67:05)
three months (67:04 - 67:07)
right (67:05 - 67:08)
like each of the seasons last three (67:07 - 67:10)
months (67:08 - 67:10)
yeah (67:10 - 67:13)
do we think it's going to be (67:10 - 67:15)
oh one classic per season (67:13 - 67:18)
right or is it gonna be this is the (67:15 - 67:20)
heritage one so we're gonna redo (67:18 - 67:23)
bubbles or charmander squirtle (67:20 - 67:26)
february march january february march (67:23 - 67:29)
that's heritage season (67:26 - 67:29)
some other (67:29 - 67:33)
thing (67:31 - 67:34)
like if the next season is the season of (67:33 - 67:36)
dragons or whatever then they're going (67:34 - 67:38)
to be back dratinity you know dratini (67:36 - 67:40)
community day is the second one but also (67:38 - 67:41)
why haven't we just had a community (67:40 - 67:43)
that's like here's all three starters (67:41 - 67:44)

i think they are testing to see how (68:02 - 68:09)
people will tolerate having a second (68:06 - 68:12)
throwback or flashback or retro or (68:09 - 68:14)
whatever you want to call it it's a bad (68:12 - 68:15)
test though you're putting like an (68:14 - 68:18)
incredibly popular gen 1 pokemon easily (68:15 - 68:20)

like venusaur but venusaur's popularity (69:03 - 69:07)
compared to charizard not even not even (69:05 - 69:09)

raids (70:38 - 70:42)
don't okay here's hot pro tip hot tip (70:39 - 70:45)
don't do any absolute raids you're (70:42 - 70:46)
probably thinking to yourself i don't (70:45 - 70:49)
have shiny absolute yet (70:46 - 70:52)
absolute mega has not been released (70:49 - 70:53)
meaning (70:52 - 70:56)
that if you're grinding axle raids for (70:53 - 70:57)
shiny which of course apsel has been (70:56 - 70:59)
shiny for what almost four years now at (70:57 - 71:02)
this point if you're grinding (70:59 - 71:04)
absolute raids for shiny you're going to (71:02 - 71:06)
have to re-grind it for mega it's going (71:04 - 71:07)
to be the same odds when it's mega (71:06 - 71:10)
ignore all absolute raids wait (71:07 - 71:12)
grind it if you have a shiny capsule you (71:10 - 71:14)
just need to get absolute mega energy (71:12 - 71:16)
yeah but then you have you're doing like (71:14 - 71:18)
at least three to four mega axle raids (71:16 - 71:21)
to get the energy for the mega and then (71:18 - 71:22)
you're like well i need more energy (71:21 - 71:24)
because i got a mega my absolute because (71:22 - 71:25)
once you have mega absolutely you'll (71:24 - 71:28)
never go back to mega houndoom (71:25 - 71:32)
because it's better it is better (71:28 - 71:34)
mega houndoom had its moment at kanto (71:32 - 71:35)
tour (71:34 - 71:36)
20 (71:35 - 71:37)
whatever year that was like was that (71:36 - 71:39)
this year was that last year i don't (71:37 - 71:42)
remember what it was (71:39 - 71:42)
it's the year of mega apps oh (71:43 - 71:49)
you know what is time it was 2021 (71:46 - 71:52)
was it yeah it sure was (71:49 - 71:55)
it was the start of (71:52 - 71:57)
yeah because niantic interviewed us at (71:55 - 71:59)
st louis and they were like what was (71:57 - 72:00)
your favorite event this year and i was (71:59 - 72:02)
like i literally looked at niantic and i (72:00 - 72:04)
was like i cannot remember this year (72:02 - 72:06)
what events happened give me a list i'll (72:04 - 72:08)
tell you which one i like to remember (72:06 - 72:11)
was nothing happened in 2020 so if there (72:08 - 72:15)
was an event it happened in 2021 (72:11 - 72:15)
no one should ever be doing earthering (72:16 - 72:21)
dawn fan meta jammer what if your (72:18 - 72:24)
favorite pokemon is ursuring and you (72:21 - 72:25)
want (72:24 - 72:28)
mega earth's ring to come up (72:25 - 72:29)
and you've waited four years to this (72:28 - 72:32)
point to grinder (72:29 - 72:32)
what is our question of the week (72:35 - 72:38)
all right what is the question of the (72:42 - 72:48)
week we want to know what you seek ask (72:45 - 72:51)
the question now (72:48 - 72:52)
i try to buy you time and you are never (72:51 - 72:54)
prepared (72:52 - 72:56)
i'm prepared (72:54 - 72:56)
why do we have a few questions (73:00 - 73:05)
because we don't get to them (73:02 - 73:07)
which no i thought we answered this one (73:05 - 73:10)
that brandon asked (73:07 - 73:10)
we picked for ourselves but not for the (73:11 - 73:15)
other hosts (73:12 - 73:15)
chris says what character human or (73:15 - 73:19)
pokemon from the games it deserves a (73:17 - 73:20)
movie flushing out their story that's (73:19 - 73:23)
actually a good question (73:20 - 73:23)
the answer is feel (73:27 - 73:30)
uh no (73:28 - 73:32)
um (73:30 - 73:32)
why can't i think of his name now (73:32 - 73:37)
the guy that turned into lickylicky (73:34 - 73:38)
oh yeah (73:37 - 73:42)
i second that what is his name (73:38 - 73:42)
his name is like baron von (73:44 - 73:49)
chuckles i think (73:47 - 73:50)
all right i have to look this up because (73:49 - 73:54)
i know it and then my brain (73:50 - 73:54)
baron alberto yes (73:56 - 74:03)
we need an origin story or continuation (73:58 - 74:05)
story of baron alberta we need to know (74:03 - 74:09)
where baron alberto came from (74:05 - 74:09)
after being a licky licky did he dream (74:10 - 74:15)
about becoming a licky licky master did (74:12 - 74:18)
he want to be a licky licky again (74:15 - 74:18)
did he change his hairstyle because his (74:19 - 74:24)
hairstyle made him look like a pidgey (74:20 - 74:26)
there's a lot of questions around baron (74:24 - 74:29)
alberto that i think we need answers (74:26 - 74:31)
i think we need more background and (74:29 - 74:33)
story on tobias (74:31 - 74:35)
how did he get dark cry where did he get (74:33 - 74:37)
the latios (74:35 - 74:39)
what actually why is he wearing a cape (74:37 - 74:42)
an interesting story to me would be (74:39 - 74:46)
agatha and oak as trainer ages because (74:42 - 74:47)
we know that they had that would be (74:46 - 74:50)
pretty good so i would like to see them (74:47 - 74:52)
not in a celebi movie but like let's go (74:50 - 74:54)
back in time and see agatha and oak (74:52 - 74:56)
running around and catching things and (74:54 - 74:58)
see that dynamic i think that would be a (74:56 - 75:00)
fun movie (74:58 - 75:00)
after the baron alberto movie (75:01 - 75:04)
i'm just going to throw it out there (75:05 - 75:09)
that there's a trainer in bdsp named (75:06 - 75:11)
karina who uses a piplup and i would be (75:09 - 75:14)
so down to see her story (75:11 - 75:17)
it's just your life with the karina in x (75:14 - 75:20)
and y who is just very obnoxious who we (75:17 - 75:21)
know that is everyone's favorite gym (75:20 - 75:23)
trainer (75:21 - 75:25)
they re you know if if there was a poke (75:23 - 75:27)
they they paired her (75:25 - 75:29)
they pushed lucario to the moon (75:27 - 75:31)
they still do (75:29 - 75:32)
but then for whatever reason they were (75:31 - 75:34)
like let's push this roller skating girl (75:32 - 75:37)
to the moon as well they really jam her (75:34 - 75:38)
down your throat that entire game (75:37 - 75:43)
everybody loves the x games (75:38 - 75:43)
somebody at game freak finally (75:44 - 75:50)
discovered extreme sports (75:45 - 75:50)
anything on youtube (75:53 - 75:58)
no i forgot to ask a question on youtube (75:55 - 76:00)
post it there people st cause you say i (75:58 - 76:02)
forget to ask you say remember oh i (76:00 - 76:04)
found a question this is from andre here (76:02 - 76:05)
we go (76:04 - 76:06)
i look i had (76:05 - 76:07)
when i post the question and thread it (76:06 - 76:09)
it's very easy to find them thing you (76:07 - 76:10)
gotta dig through youtube comments it's (76:09 - 76:12)
already a nightmare hey if you're (76:10 - 76:13)
watching on youtube like and subscribe (76:12 - 76:15)
uh what rpg mechanic would you want (76:13 - 76:18)
incorporated into a mainline game that (76:15 - 76:20)
hasn't been implemented to date and is (76:18 - 76:23)
working well in another rpg good example (76:20 - 76:24)
if you have them i do have an example (76:23 - 76:27)
but i'll go last (76:24 - 76:28)
did they give an example what they were (76:27 - 76:30)
talking about no they said if you have (76:28 - 76:34)
an example given (76:30 - 76:34)
i've played a lot of jrpgs so i feel (76:35 - 76:39)
like i i have a couple (76:37 - 76:42)
but there's one that stands out to me (76:39 - 76:42)
so okay (76:43 - 76:48)
one thing that i would like to see (76:45 - 76:50)
implemented in pokemon games is (76:48 - 76:52)
a job system (76:50 - 76:54)
where (76:52 - 76:56)
much like because i like job systems (76:54 - 76:58)
like i like final fantasy 14 where you (76:56 - 76:59)
can switch jobs i like that in final (76:58 - 77:02)
fantasy games but like you could pick up (76:59 - 77:05)
a specific job like (77:02 - 77:07)
i'm going to pick the pokemon breeder (77:05 - 77:10)
job so therefore i can (77:07 - 77:12)
hatch and make eggs eggs better and get (77:10 - 77:13)
better eevees like (77:12 - 77:16)
a job type system where your trainer (77:13 - 77:18)
customization (77:16 - 77:21)
affects the game more than cosmetically (77:18 - 77:23)
[Music] (77:21 - 77:25)
i think for me um (77:23 - 77:27)
i would like to see like different (77:25 - 77:29)
skills that you could level up as a (77:27 - 77:30)
trainer so like (77:29 - 77:32)
um if you like catch more pokemon you (77:30 - 77:34)
like level up your catching skill and as (77:32 - 77:35)
you (77:34 - 77:37)
level up that skill it makes it easier (77:35 - 77:38)
to catch or like level up your breeding (77:37 - 77:40)
skill to like take less steps or (77:38 - 77:42)
something like that i think that'd be (77:40 - 77:43)
cool (77:42 - 77:45)
gosh that is actually really good (77:43 - 77:46)
everybody there's that was that was in (77:45 - 77:48)
like grand theft auto i think (77:46 - 77:51)
or or saints row a lot of games if you (77:48 - 77:53)
like jumped a lot your jumping would be (77:51 - 77:55)
better and some people would just like (77:53 - 77:58)
uh turbo a like all night so then they (77:55 - 78:02)
like maximize their jump (77:58 - 78:02)
i do like that a lot (78:02 - 78:06)
the thing i was thinking of is what (78:04 - 78:08)
bravely default does they do two things (78:06 - 78:10)
number one is when you're when you're (78:08 - 78:12)
looking at creatures in the overworld (78:10 - 78:15)
they will run away from you and your (78:12 - 78:17)
characters if they're too low level (78:15 - 78:19)
letting you know that like oh you can (78:17 - 78:22)
ignore those and if they're higher level (78:19 - 78:24)
and and they do the thing where if it's (78:22 - 78:25)
higher level you'll just get (78:24 - 78:27)
significantly more experience (78:25 - 78:29)
they'll be aggressive and they'll have (78:27 - 78:30)
like a little like exclamation point (78:29 - 78:32)
above their head being like i'm mad (78:30 - 78:34)
because i'm better than you and like you (78:32 - 78:36)
just know that like oh (78:34 - 78:38)
if i'm grinding they're gonna pretty (78:36 - 78:41)
much come to me in this area and once i (78:38 - 78:42)
get to a certain level they're going to (78:41 - 78:45)
be not angry anymore because now (78:42 - 78:47)
i'm better than them i feel like they (78:45 - 78:49)
started that feel a little bit in the (78:47 - 78:51)
wild area aren't they going to do that (78:49 - 78:53)
for legends isn't that what the red eyed (78:51 - 78:55)
yeah that's what that's what i hope that (78:53 - 78:55)
is (78:55 - 78:57)
and then the other thing that bravely (78:55 - 78:59)
default does is they just have like a (78:57 - 79:01)
straight up speed up mechanic (78:59 - 79:02)
they'll be like (79:01 - 79:04)
you can just it's like the r button but (79:02 - 79:06)
yeah like one (79:04 - 79:08)
times one times two times three times (79:06 - 79:10)
four and but their battles are like much (79:08 - 79:13)
much longer like way way longer a boss (79:10 - 79:15)
battle in that game (79:13 - 79:19)
is probably like a 20 minute (79:15 - 79:20)
like fight (79:19 - 79:23)
and there's always like a break point in (79:20 - 79:25)
the fight where (79:23 - 79:27)
the fight changes and that's usually (79:25 - 79:29)
where you like lose so it is frustrating (79:27 - 79:30)
to get like 15 minutes in the fight and (79:29 - 79:32)
then you're in the final stage and then (79:30 - 79:33)
they like wipe your party and you're (79:32 - 79:34)
like (79:33 - 79:37)
i don't want to do this again um i mean (79:34 - 79:39)
bravely default also has (79:37 - 79:42)
very specific (79:39 - 79:44)
moves and patterns to defeat enemies so (79:42 - 79:47)
like it's easy to be like i have to (79:44 - 79:49)
fight this 14 times i need to fly (79:47 - 79:51)
through it um (79:49 - 79:53)
but i i do i i would like you speed up (79:51 - 79:55)
mechanic for certain things (79:53 - 79:56)
there are (79:55 - 79:59)
very weird people out there that like (79:56 - 80:02)
the grind in pokemon and those people (79:59 - 80:04)
like grinding those people are those (80:02 - 80:06)
people those people are the ones that (80:04 - 80:08)
are very into diamond and pearl because (80:06 - 80:10)
it's a very grinding game there's no (80:08 - 80:12)
doubt (80:10 - 80:14)
but also like (80:12 - 80:16)
i don't think it would be if you want (80:14 - 80:19)
your game to be grindy if that's what (80:16 - 80:21)
you're setting up to be it would be nice (80:19 - 80:22)
to have a fast forward mechanic because (80:21 - 80:24)
bravely default is a grindy game and it (80:22 - 80:27)
didn't it did at a certain point get to (80:24 - 80:29)
me where it's like okay (80:27 - 80:31)
gotta grind for a bit but the like speed (80:29 - 80:34)
up mechanic was like really nice because (80:31 - 80:35)
you're you're not gonna change the way (80:34 - 80:37)
you think about grinding you're just (80:35 - 80:38)
like i'm gonna have to go in (80:37 - 80:40)
knock out these go back heel come back (80:38 - 80:42)
out grind (80:40 - 80:43)
i feel like this is another episode of (80:42 - 80:46)
it should have been a toggle (80:43 - 80:48)
that should be a toggle but (80:46 - 80:50)
bravely default is a very grindy game (80:48 - 80:52)
like (80:50 - 80:56)
and that's part of the storyline like (80:52 - 80:58)
the grind is built into the game for a (80:56 - 81:01)
very specific reason for that one (80:58 - 81:05)
um so yeah i get it like (81:01 - 81:05)
grinding isn't fun (81:05 - 81:09)
for a lot of people so it should be a (81:07 - 81:11)
toggle there should be a way to speed it (81:09 - 81:13)
up (81:11 - 81:13)
two good questions (81:13 - 81:16)
hey that's pretty much our show no (81:15 - 81:18)
pokemon of the week because will's not (81:16 - 81:20)

and if you guys instagram he's like (81:20 - 81:24)
hanging out with birds i don't know he's (81:22 - 81:26)

hawaii (81:26 - 81:29)
it's a thing to do here but it's better (81:27 - 81:30)
in hawaii because it'll be outside it's (81:29 - 81:32)
warm (81:30 - 81:33)
yeah i guess (81:32 - 81:34)
uh (81:33 - 81:37)
pengu thanks for being on the show today (81:34 - 81:39)
thanks for having me on again (81:37 - 81:42)
you uh people can find you on on socials (81:39 - 81:44)
you also have like a little store right (81:42 - 81:46)
i do have a little store so uh this is (81:44 - 81:48)
what i was making it's all finished for (81:46 - 81:50)
those on the youtube um i sell these on (81:48 - 81:52)
the interwebs you can find me on twitter (81:50 - 81:54)
at pingumon and links to the rest of me (81:52 - 81:58)
on the internet is is there (81:54 - 81:58)
greg is on twitter at white wing (81:59 - 82:03)
i'm on twitter at dragging a lake (82:01 - 82:07)
uh legends is (82:03 - 82:07)
uh (82:07 - 82:10)
we got two more podcasts before legends (82:08 - 82:12)
comes out and then i'm assuming greg and (82:10 - 82:14)
i will be doing a mini series for (82:12 - 82:16)
legends oh i have (82:14 - 82:18)
no clue what that looks like because we (82:16 - 82:20)
have no structure for that game (82:18 - 82:24)
i they haven't said that there are there (82:20 - 82:26)
are definitely stars (82:24 - 82:28)
and the stars mean something (82:26 - 82:30)
but how how long does it take to get a (82:28 - 82:32)
star how (82:30 - 82:34)
how fast are we getting to that we we (82:32 - 82:35)
know for sure that that cleaver battle (82:34 - 82:37)
is the first big (82:35 - 82:39)
fight (82:37 - 82:41)
and if i'm assuming that that is like (82:39 - 82:44)
the equivalent to a gym (82:41 - 82:47)
how many gyms are there and (82:44 - 82:50)
do we stop at every big battle (82:47 - 82:53)
are there even gyms maybe the cleaver (82:50 - 82:56)
thing is just aside i don't know i don't (82:53 - 82:57)
know (82:56 - 82:59)
uh i think you'll find out if you listen (82:57 - 83:00)
to the miniseries (82:59 - 83:03)
i feel like what little we know about it (83:00 - 83:04)
it (83:03 - 83:06)
probably makes sense (83:04 - 83:09)
as each new area unlocks because it (83:06 - 83:11)
sounds like after you complete xyz a new (83:09 - 83:13)
area will unlock and there's like what (83:11 - 83:15)
seven areas (83:13 - 83:18)
that feels like (83:15 - 83:22)
a thing that that game will do (83:18 - 83:22)
yeah (83:22 - 83:26)
there's always the the worry that the (83:24 - 83:27)
reason they're not showing a lot is (83:26 - 83:29)
because they've already shown what (83:27 - 83:32)
what there is (83:29 - 83:32)
and then the other thing is like maybe (83:32 - 83:36)
there is a lot and they're not they just (83:34 - 83:40)
don't want to spoil it but (83:36 - 83:40)
they showed what diamond and pearl was (83:40 - 83:46)
and it was exactly what it was they (83:42 - 83:48)
thought diamond and pearl existed (83:46 - 83:51)
yeah before so we all sort of knew it (83:48 - 83:54)
wasn't veering far off the formula we (83:51 - 83:55)
just didn't know (83:54 - 83:57)
how strict they were keeping to the (83:55 - 83:59)
formula yeah i mean when they showed (83:57 - 84:02)
crown tundra and isle of armor they (83:59 - 84:05)
that that was it they showed their hand (84:02 - 84:06)
and we got what they showed there wasn't (84:05 - 84:07)
like (84:06 - 84:10)
anything (84:07 - 84:10)
that was like shocking when i went to (84:10 - 84:14)
the crown tundra and i was like oh my (84:12 - 84:17)
gosh what a crazy spoiler here it was (84:14 - 84:17)
like (84:17 - 84:19)
this is what they showed us and this is (84:17 - 84:22)
what we got yeah i feel like (84:19 - 84:23)
do we have we have a little bit more (84:22 - 84:25)
mystery with sword and shield i don't (84:23 - 84:27)
know it's hard to say (84:25 - 84:28)
i i'm (84:27 - 84:31)
more curious what that (84:28 - 84:33)
trailer says in english (84:31 - 84:35)
because i want to know how much they (84:33 - 84:38)
actually said (84:35 - 84:38)
yeah (84:39 - 84:42)
well i'm sure we'll get something this (84:40 - 84:43)
week i'm sure that trailer will get (84:42 - 84:45)
translated or we'll get like a reduced (84:43 - 84:47)
like three minute english trailer that (84:45 - 84:49)
kind of cuts the fat or we get something (84:47 - 84:51)
new altogether but (84:49 - 84:52)
