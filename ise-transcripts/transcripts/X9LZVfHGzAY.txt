[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 390 second episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ almost messed that up did not speaking of messing up Greg is here how am i messing up excuse me no like I mean don't look at my life too closely but what we have I'm here I am here it is Sub Zero I don't have the day off tomorrow and I'm mad about my life that was the mess up yeah no day off tomorrow Bobby also here yeah I am not in sub-zero weather but I don't have the day off tomorrow either oh my gosh I'm messing up as well don't you have the day off tomorrow either it's true I don't I have two podcasts come out tomorrow this one and the first episode of Irene and my my I don't know what to call them review podcast anime podcast where we talk about Twilight wings so that came out on Thursday the six minute episode of Twilight wings that'll be in this feed it should actually have by the time this episode comes out should be in the podcast feed but that will next week go to the patreon only feed but we decided to make the first episode free so we can get your taste buds a little wet right it is always free kids yeah the remainder of the Twilight winds will be for any patrons five dollars and up but I read and I like the first episode so you can listen to our thoughts on that on that version of the podcast speaking of podcasts we got some Pokemon news it feels like an eternity since they announced the Pokemon expansion pack I know I feel so long though I don't know feels real long you're you're running into that old person time it is it is we got one thing wrong last week I just want to start off with that correction you pulled off Pokemon calm I don't know how we missed this cub foo will either evolve into single strike style or Shifu or rapid style strike a Shifu which form it evolves into will change depending on the choices made during your adventure the forms are not tied to game the game versions you are playing oh well that's that's good yeah you scaling to get one though right or can you I don't know if you get multiple Cub Foods because I feel like if it's based off the choices you make you make that choice you know someone always says not always black and white you get one choice in one of them and that's it you're you're stuck with whatever style with that game because those are the choices you made until you get that D evolution spray yeah yeah is that coming hopefully soon let's get into the real news here you will start with thoughts or with Pokemon masters oh joy let's there's a new update here are they added like a new thing I haven't I haven't experimented with it yet so I hope I hope Greg didn't share some light here it's been a real busy week for me so my masters gameplay has gone a little bit down you don't think I could share some light Steve shed some light yeah you could probably I mean I guess a view for the Pokemon go segment stay in your lane Bobby but if you vote that masters feedback that's great I will probably announce this on stream later today I guess if you're listening the podcast you can hear it here first complete full disclosure DNA developer of Pokemon masters reached out to me and asked if I would like to be a partner for their game I signed some agreements and what that means is I get to see a little bit of behind the scenes of Pokemon masters so I am aware of when things are coming out prior to you guys now although I'm not allowed to disclose that kind of stuff I can't believe the point of this deal I can't read Pokemon masters - game comm I can't read off that that's true the partnership also they give me a they'll they'll start to give me a stipend every month for free gems so that's that's the benefit Greg I'm in the deep gem pocket of DIA now I'm at you know I'm more mad at you know so just full disclosure there obviously I've had problems with masters in the past that probably now puts two into two together of why I've been playing more masters because DNA is trying really hard to make sure that people who are playing masters both content creators and their fan base their audience are happy with the game with that being said there's a new message from the Pokemon masters team volume six Greg they've changed some stuff and the disclosure Greg and Bobby are not in the big pockets of DNA no so I can be as rude as I walk it's true yeah they could it can be and I don't have the game even on my phone so I'm neither here nor there alright why you didn't have anything to say about it well I just wanted to be invited no okay alright but why would we invite you to a party you don't want to be it well maybe in my patient is nice volume six we'll get you back into the game that's where the turning point is volume six so they added something called sync grids that has that was scheduled for Mitch anywhere it actually just came out they will feature there are new features that allow you to strengthen your sync pairs in various ways the basics here in order to activate tiles in the sync grid you will need to collect sync orbs at the beginning of the battle the sync orb chance message may appear by using sync orbs to activate tiles you can teach and sync pairs with new grid skills however activating the tiles will reduce your pool of available energy some tiles on the sync radition Ulrich's such as minimum sync level and we were planning to have the following features unlocked you can stat rays sync move enhancements improve to move effectiveness and accuracy and passive skills and they have some future plans here in late January price and seal everyone's favorite couple will happen no anyone's ever set prices their favorite trainer but maybe I don't know there's probably somebody out there they will have their sync grid expanded generally we as in DNA are planning on expanding sync grids for about 4 sync pairs each month I have not played with the sync grid Greg have you synced grid and did I've started a little there there's a new requirement a new thing to get which is sync orbs so you certain things need sync orb so unfortunately again there's like they've added a way to try to make these pairs better that comes with a grind as of like right now there doesn't seem to be an ideal like a super ideal path to follow for the sinks so like depending on what you want out of each sink pair there are different ways to go which is actually nice but also we're very early into this so it's hard to say that oh there's five choices right now but ultimately four of those choices are terrible and aren't worth it it's interesting that way at least I know at least for the Infernape build there's a lot I think there's four that people like for the main character and I think the Flannery one has like two that are like worth it I have obviously have not gotten them completely built out so I don't know how big of a difference it makes this is clearly them trying to make it so that you can play your favorite sync pairs and not have them be completely useless at endgame I don't know if it's enough and since it comes with a grind I don't know if unless you're heavily invested that you're gonna want to grind out all the items necessary to max out Flannery like if you're not gonna use Flannery and torkoal and plenary is a 3-star and Infernape if you haven't earned it but a lot of people do is just the better fire type unless you're really invested in Flannery I don't see why you would grind to do that sync grid unless you didn't have you didn't have the Infernape yeah II didn't have him print it but this is also the problem of now that they've somewhat improved summoning you get more gems so since you can summon more it feels less bad when you get the worst summons because it's like well I only have to wait a couple of days and I can summon again knowing that there are better ones out there like I have my only ground-type right now is clay and it's not good the good one is Cynthia and so it's like well I don't want to put anything into clay because I know at some point I will probably get the random chance to get Cynthia I guess my question is is the sinc ruied yes hold from a different game well yes sort of if anybody ever played Final Fantasy 10 is a similar system where you're following paths to unlock or increase abilities so 10 had sort of the talent tree system where you put gems in a grid and you could take different paths it's very similar to that oh so there's not like a current MOU there's not a current gotcha game on the market like dragalge I lost or so Duvalier lost has grids but they're set there's not paths so you can enhance the mana and abilities in a very specific way for each character this offers choices like there are different paths but we don't know yet if the other paths are viable paths or if it's really just there's one viable path and all other options are terrible because it's still really really early and how this is gonna and it's like what are they going to come up with next when do you use them what do you use them for my hope is that they've made it in such a way that you can build out how you like to play with that character and that will always still be valid and it doesn't fall in the trap that a lot of talent tree systems fall into where yeah there's 15 paths but really there's just one and right only one good path and there's a billion bad choices with a lot of people who play gotcha games they want to min/max that's kind of the issue we saw at the beginning of masters which was well the only three good characters at the moment are I don't even remember what they were at the time I think Olivia was one the top Karen was the top for a long time until they did liepard so Karen in life hard sort of switched cuz there are only good dark types Phoebe is still probably the best tank that is out there like they have not topped a tank like Phoebe I do like baby she's yeah baby and dustox says it is a great is a great pair it's a great support it's just probably the best one to get on single-player teams because everything attacks dusclops and it's got so much health that all of your more frail attackers can just be like hey we have free reign to the battlefield look that slop goes way beyond Pokemon masters it's a menacing sword and shoot yeah this is I will say this is a positive step in making the pairs that you want to use better once they get it out for everybody there's still a grind I hate I just hate that there's no Auto skip feature it's just to have to grind all of this out like I was gonna play today and everything that's in front of me is just a grind I have to grind against this or after grind against that or I have to grind over here and I just couldn't do it like I meant I compared that to Drew Galia lost we're right now in to rally I lost all I have to do is a grind but I have skip passes so 90% of it is me just saying yep I know I have to do this just give me the rewards I've done this 50,000 times and I can get those out of the way and then go play the more fun still a little bit granted but the more fund rate content and then I'm done I'm not done in in 20 minutes I you know got everything I needed to get done for the day I know it's a grind so I didn't have to suffer whereas if I was gonna go into masters it's like well I will spend 20 minutes on this fighting three battles and that will get me an eighth of the way of where I need to be to even start making dents and some of the grind that I have to do do you think the reason is for that though do you think that they DNA thinks that people will just play their game longer versus like just not playing the game yes well that DNA I saw this is the tricky question maybe I can just like ask them now that I'm in this partner discord with them but I wonder if it's like the same actual team who made Fire Emblem because did am i yes he did DNA not publish Fire Emblem that has poles well that's a different kind of grind though I don't know cuz you're that's more of like a turn-based tactical I just think of the pulling heroes from that yeah I mean it was a Gacha game and it did have a grind what was it called Fire Emblem yeah it was higher but Emblem here is right yeah mm-hmm I guess I don't know how many like studios or maybe Studios isn't the right word teams inside DNA or making different games cuz like there's DNA also made Animal Crossing well firing heroes was made by intelligent systems that sounds like a conglomerate that owns a bunch of other yeah I don't know they break out or I want to find him with DNA how de na de na ok so right now in 2019 they've done hope my Master's with the cooperation of the Pokemon company obviously DNA has to report back to the big old TPC Mario Kart Animal Crossing pocket camp they did do Fire Emblem knew well they did with development with cooperation of intelligence system well that's the same as that's the same as TCP I because intelligent systems technically I pretty sure owns part of Fire Emblem do they not yeah closely affiliate with Nintendo best for developing a Fire Emblem Paper Mario warrior where and the wars series got it and then they made Super Mario run and they made miitomo and I even know me tome was still going no it didn't it ended may 9 2008 so yep 2008 maybe 2018 does feel like 2008 at this point is ancient history here I mean I'll say this for a lot it's not uncommon in a lot of the Gacha games that you have to play through the content because they still see you playing their game no matter how much of a grind it is as getting touch and value out of the game Plus well correct okay so but grinds not terribly awful no but the the main problem the main I just said that as somebody who is probably 90% of our listeners are guilty of battle melee for 200 times or riding their bike in a circle in the hatching 500 eggs the biggest difference about the grind in mobile and why they don't do a lot of skips is because part of the goal is to make you frustrated enough to buy the shortcut there's a there's a level of oh I have to spend two hours getting this to where I need to to continue the game or I could spend $15 and then just get all the things I need it's a philosophy that is common that I don't agree with like I have given more money to do Galia Lost than I have any other mobile game simply because I feel like they are being very nice to me and I enjoy that experience so therefore I will give them money whereas when I hit walls and other games and Pokemon masters is by no means the worst offender although I still think their pricing scale is outrageous like a lot of other games like this hit you with a wall that is deliberately frustrating to get you to pay money see but clash royale was like that and I feel like clash Royale is no longer like that yeah what they also learned so they learned like what almost two years yeah like learn learn I don't think they learned fast right but they did learn that people will view a game and I think part of it is they saw the writing on the wall with Apple arcade that the pay2win model is a short term solution and that people are gonna get real tired of that real quick and so I think clash Royale did the thing like they saw the writing on the wall and said okay no we have to change like this has to be a different model and I don't think any of these other games are there yet I think they still rely on that will frustrate them until they pay money model which guarantees I won't give money I just won't I won't pay you I won't pay you for a frustrating experience I will pay you for a very enjoyable experience so I do yeah I will agree with that half I do enjoy games that have a frustrating experience built into them but not ones that have it built into them to make you pay more right so like the games that I find I find games fun that where like I want to throw the controller at the TV sometimes right but only went because once you get past that it's like feels so good to get past it but if your frustration is leaving you to pay more money then that is it I don't want to do that I feel like I don't have that with mobile games in general except first couple months of clash for I was like oh my gosh I need to uninstall this I finally broke my clash royale sword and shield broke me free of clash Royale yeah I feel like sword and shield kind of broke me free of clash Royale - I feel like I don't I don't want to go in I'm like I look at it like I could go in but no it's for us it's kind of a frustrating game yeah it broke like also I also use Pokemon go as another example of a game that I have put money in but I put money in when it was to spend time with my friend like to do more raids like I've bought raid passes I have bought other things with my with my friends I've never felt like I had to pay money to get enjoyment out of Pokemon go and so I have given them money while I gripe about it because I don't like giving money away for I don't I don't like giving money way for digital goods though that are ephemeral but I understand that I'm doing that to participate in the things with my friends that I enjoy and Pokemon go doesn't make me do that to enjoy their game and so I don't well hate giving them money some of their events definitely require money but yeah those events like that's that's a good choice because I don't like the exclusivity that Pokemon go puts on certain like but usually it comes down to Chinese right Chinese I felt like I need to just spend money to get a Wurmple oh oh I didn't send it I got my we're pulling a party hat today that I nice it's the same thing going back to you know whether a game wants you to pay money to skip or if you want to spend the two hours and doing yourself and Pokemon go has that with incubators of do you want to hatch 1/2 K incubator at a time or do you want to buy more to hatch multiple or do you want to walk like four times the distance right and that's ok you yeah Chinese costumes whatever it may be but the fact that they put party hat Wurmple in eggs specifically and then gave that a you know a timeline there a deadline it of the same feeling where I spent money I don't know if it was was it wasn't really happy to but I wanted to get this this Pokemon and I knew I had to spend money in order to try to get that and even more so like the shiny one which I never ended up getting so I just spent that money and for chance which obviously is my fault I chose to do that I understand that but I just don't like when it's just behind a paywall because people will say oh well no it's not behind a paywall you could just hatch one egg at a time with the free incubator or you could go to gyms every day and get your coins up and then that's how you do it but that's not really I mean Pokemon go nose or neon technic knows that they put something in an egg for two weeks that people are going to spend a lot of money to try to get that oh yeah so even though yes there are ways of getting free coins it doesn't change the fact that they know exactly what they're doing and they're ramping up their revenue by making the exclusivity behind a paywall so I will say though they do have a record solid record of bringing things back so I think yes if you're patient and understand that like you're in this game for the long haul because like Pokemon is a huge thing for me so it's like I don't care when I get it I know I will get it eventually yes great for I'm not in a rush so it's like okay I you know I I was lucky I got one it was one of the eggs that I had picked up sometime in the paid time period and I hatched it and it was oh my go cool I got it I could have like I miss all the swords of Justice I like all of them have had very reasons very good reasons to want to get them it didn't happen and I'm like well they'll be field research in seven months okay a good example though is who knows if we're ever getting one piece hat Pikachu back we never got black hat Pikachu back ever well ever that's not a thing right like we haven't gotten it back yet it but what we don't get it ever possible cuz I wonder is the Hat rotation Bobby they didn't the black hat wasn't in the Hat rotation or they did one Pikachu a week or day yeah that wasn't in the rotational it was triad in it yes it was okay the what was that one piece one piece yeah oh one piece and summer like summer hat yeah we're both in it I mean there's many reasons to bring the back right like we aren't there yet they could come back they could come back as a throwback event like yeah I mean I think Wurmple is definitely coming back I just the black hat Pikachu has never come back well as of this recording yeah I mean they know that people want these things right so when they're feeling the pinch or you know it's dead of winter and playtime is down guess what comes back maybe yeah we'll feed you well that the black hat Pikachu was the difference was is that that was I guess sort of like the one piece Pikachu but it was in collaboration with another like a street wear company if I remember correctly it was so it could even be more so like the next time that that company decides to do a collaboration with Pokemon right right yeah that again so that could be more based on when that company wants to do something and I'm sure the Pokemon company or any antic probably signed some deal of like once this hat is in the game we own it forever and we can own whatever we launched our this idea absolutely they would not they would be foolish to not do something like that yes yeah it was for like Pokemon go again it's a patience thing like I will get them eventually and I don't care win so I don't like pay for extra incubators like I guess I'm not gonna walk around with Wurmple party hat on my thing so people can see it the only time I show it is to take a picture of it and send it to you too you'll tweet it and then I'm done like that's my weird flex for the week I got this digital thing yeah I guess I do see the difference in that it's not keeping you from going forward in the game because who knows what forward is in Pokemon go anyway but and it is a patience thing i mean i'm not saying i entik is evil because they want to make money their business they have to make money or else they don't exist so they turn in a better way right and bringing stuff back is is something that is it's very good so it is it is a patience game and yeah you know like you said the swords are justice they'll come back they're gonna come back and research they're gonna come back like we got but Latios and latias coming back next weekend like these things come back multiple times so it's patience I will say this masters is also a patience game like you can wait until you get enough free gifts of all the things of the people give you but like that's months right now yeah I mean I guess so masters isn't slowing down in new stuff like it seems like Pokemon go isn't like slowing down but they're like treading water that we have all these jeanna Pokemon but it's too soon yeah so they're like a holding tank trip bed don't you Steve yeah hundred percent what how many species do we have now in Gen 5 like a hundred maybe we can talk about that when we get to put one go okay let me let me speaking of new stuff I'll finish this masters there's a new legendary event coming late January a new legendary event is coming later in January is a popular legendary Pokemon and in the screenshot it looks like there's some hice behind it i full disclosure I don't know what this is I'm gonna guess a --pqm though what other popular legendary ice pokemon would there be Articuno so you couldn't so here's the thing you have to think of when you're thinking of masters you can't think of just the Pokemon you have to think of the character I think of the character goes with so Lawrence the third I mean I will put an asterisk against that that they did makes saga leo no main character so they could do that again so when I was on the Pokemon master subreddit they they all assume it's kiram pairs with getss which i guess sure because giovani pairs with me too so like they're not like the DNA is not afraid or however whoever makes the decision of who's paired with who I'm not sure if it's DNA or the Pokemon company somebody's not afraid of giving you a bad guy to play as know if but would it not be cool everybody its colorist right yeah whole dress it would be paired in multiple games it wouldn't be n because n would be the Reshiram and Zekrom and would be both Reshiram and Zekrom right but it yeah it would be it would 100% be colorist over a hundred percent big colorist that's this guess this is a nobody chorus has appeared in many games I mean guess this is not a nobody guess this is a nobody do the sync pairs have can you have like Giovanni with Persian and then also GL him from you too well I could they could yeah they could they don't yes Rosa with Snivy right and then Rosa with Rosa was delibird what else do they do have understand that you level there for all intents and purposes two different people like you can't level Rosa with Snivy Oh any of that benefit to delibird Delawares is a separate track yeah yeah I know I understand that I just I was wondering if they were doing the same or do they do the other way around do they have delibird with two different or do they have any Pokemon the two different trainers nope No so like on the subreddit they haven't done weavile yet and so I think silver had a Weavile there's another person that has a weave oh what's his name the bad guy in Gen 4 Cyrus has a Weavile so everyone's like who's gonna get the wheel other people want to assume that silver should have got crobat because the whole point is like crobat evolve see friendship and it finally gets it and silver is a criminal but they gave crobat to Koga yeah they gave crobat to Koga well why didn't they give Koko than a month I'd understand yeah that seems like the better or the why did they get emotional every dose whoo Oh Janine she had area to us right yeah that makes sense does it not cuz area does my interest in Jen too and she was in Jen too ya know that make sense sure sure yeah what she's a poison ghibli to me the kogas that wasn't Elite 4 and Gen 2 and had a crow bat didn't he yeah but if yeah I mean I well like what else do you get silver if you're not giving silver crow bat or weavile or it can't have any of the starters cuz I already did that all the starters are used all right I'll gen 2 starters already in the game No then that just announced Ethan on Twitter like a week ago with oh yeah oh just kidding yeah they did has there been a pattern of how they've been pulling these no like really weird of what they end up giving silver so we've out there that has to be cyrus crobat there to give that to Koga none of the starters Gengar is saved for Agatha which makes sense for Agatha he had a Kadabra slash Alakazam but that's would you would guess that that would be Sabrina cuz Sabrina's not in the game yet right and I've what else do you give Sabrina besides Alakazam right right so you either give him Weavile or you give him magnus meg time or do you give him one of the legendaries from gen - hey he doesn't ever have one though right he does in the stadium games yeah I mean you could give him ho or lugia that's true I don't know I I don't know that I could not tell you the rhyme or reason when they introduce people like most of them makes sense the only one that doesn't really make sense is like Koga with crobat I guess unless you look at specifically his Elite Four but like Koga and venomoth kind of always went hand-in-hand who's got soul really Oh your main male character Oh which is well you would have thought they would have been produced Lily for that but that's fine I guess is that an issue it's just an interesting it's just like it's just thinking of who get who's getting what which is like one of the best parts of masters is like which I kind of get character gets put with which iconic Pokemon that's like the funnest part the most fun part of the game I think I don't disagree with covet Pro bet for Koga I mean I do agree that venomoth carried through two games but like he does have in most media to Crobat Crobat so yeah and some of them are easy like there's no way they don't introduce gladion with type nulls of a lie right like right there's no way like when they introduced Guzman the dudes gonna have a girl as a bug like some thought no one's debating that he's gonna have if you have a logo and Radek eight kessane even parked archetypes are there any other ones in the game like a Lola and how he has house right you alone aren't you and okay which makes sense for how I mean when they introduced if and when they introduced hop like the dudes gonna have woohoo right oh come on is Lulu yeah well the bump-out make it double right yeah they tend to go for the well no they could give him one Lu and then you have to go through the evolution so they they could have evolution that new then you evolve it to double I could see them doing that there's a nice type Pokemon coming at the end of February red it is it's gonna be us first write it write it is saying Hyrum and gets us I see is saying kiram and colorist I think it's caravan call risk urban chorus makes more sense I mean I have a is there an image the only image is on the there news page which I'm reading which has just the nurse joy in front of an iceberg why did we think it wasn't it was anything I didn't realize what the what the text said that is under there an unidentified dragon pokémon seems to have appeared near the glaciers recently oh yeah I'm sorry yes yeah oh yeah you guys okay how could I get my masters Laura that limits it down right cuz they carry one ice dragon right yes I think so I'm trying to think if there was one that was introduced in the new game but there's not not legendary no no here i'm kyra my CRM is the only ice dragon okay is there is there stretches there like a third character Cole wrists gets us the stretch could be in yeah that's that's really stretching you you like you absolutely saved you you release two ends one with thicker more threads right well you could release three ends theorem and then white caravan black Hyrum the fused forms cuz gets us never has control of Kirin throughout the entire games gaseous never has anything worthless like like gets us does have control of either zekrom or Reshiram at one point because no point he ever has control of kiram unless you're talking about the one kiram fuse i guess maybe if you're counting when kiram fuses with Zekrom a rush or a maybe but no horse is the one with pyram capture the airship shooting ice beams everywhere yeah i if they introduced gets as they introduced them with hi dragon right like hi dragon this was Pokemon yes and if they introduced alder they're gonna do it with boo fellahin yeah or maybe Volcarona I don't know they take that from will that's true all right anyways who knew we spent so long I masters you started it I'm sorry six-month anniversary collection celebration that was not the word collection Pokemon masters celebrated six-month anniversary in February this is what this is what's gonna happen battle villa villa will make its long-awaited debut and passio story event overhaul we're giving story events an overhaul starting in

main story the past 20 because I don't want to do the grind there you go you got well you got time in our next message we will tell you about the six-month anniversary celebration and the updates for to March next schedule message is for late February thank you for making masters more enjoyable we appreciate the feedback any comments until next time um Steve said give him my email I got a lot to talk about your email you know it's funny cuz his game seemed like a hot mess like a month or two effort came out but they said they were this is what their six-month plan and hey they've stuck to it so yeah I mean they're making it less of a hot mess it's still full of problems but I will say this they are attempting to correct it they are attempting to course-correct I don't know if it's enough like I think they may have lost a lot of non hardcore Pokemon players and I'm curious after the six months after a lot of this goes in what they're gonna do to try to lure people back like that exclusive pair that you get had better be amazing to pull people back in I don't even know at this point what would it be really could've like is it like Astin greninja like what do you is it Leon and Charizard is it only trainers like could there possibly ever be like a nurse joy in Chansey Chansey is already taken oh well chances taken by the I can't remember her name she's the one that like walks you through the forest when you first play Ruby and Sapphire right no not Ruby and Sapphire the one after that I'll hurl diamond pearl I can't remember her name but yeah she's the one that just begin with an M I think it believed begins with an M she was the one that walks you through the forest for the first time and then you have a bunch of double battles and after every battle she she heals you gotcha uh so she has Chauncey so she's like not a she's not like an actual I mean she's a trainer obviously but she's not like a gym leader or a main story character marlis got the arcanite look I've pulled way too many Marlies oh don't okay I just never mind that but how about give us the barkeep in indeedy oh I don't think they've done anything like that yet I guess they don't look no there's so many characters they haven't pulled a specifically TV show character yet like a Cheryl Cheryl of course they're everyone's favorite Cheryl or my favorite Cheryl hmm I'm trying to think if a Charizard isn't in the game currently I don't think well then it comes with Leon at some point in the future well they also haven't had read yet either but they've had it has maybe it's red because it could be red as well who do they put red with pikas like peaches already in it charizard blastoise know cuz you save chars are for Leon yeah what everybody loves Charizard and red is hey red yabba Leon's cooler than red let's be honest here I do like Leon a lot you're right in one of their tweets from back in July Greg's gizzard they didn't have introducing sync pair red and Charizard you'll meet more legends like him and I'm pretty sure they're not in the game no red and tartar are in the game I mean they can go to Charizard but they announced that they were in the game back in July so this has to be what they're putting in right this has to be the pair that you're getting for free they already announced it before the game launched Megas yes yes yes when a Pokemon does is it's a sink move it will sometimes have Omega yes Cynthia's well and little carrier trainer Oh what is her name on the roller skate Breanna yep maybe maybe they do like Leon with GMAX Charizard or something down the line okay the characters they've shown so far but that are not in the game but they've shown them Archer which is the admin of Team Rocket he's in let's go I can't remember what his Pokemon less of the bad guy and golden silver isn't he yes yes yeah Arianna Chile silent crest those are the three gym leaders black and white I don't know who Ariana's I can't remember her name oh she's the other admin sorry oh yeah yeah diantha would have Gardevoir obviously obviously fan tina who would hope man what would she have she's the ghost type person is type in dr. Pro she would have miss Vegas oh yeah yeah yeah gladion hue lily loose amine Palmer professor Cucuy Professor Oak professor Sycamore red which was featured with Charizard yeah it just gotta be the one Sabrina silver Steven which is literally on the cover of the game when you log in is it would that be beldam that would be Metagross or and then wall-e which would probably be Glade at this point yeah since they wreck on that and Omega Ruby out the sapphire have they done ultra beast kit like Lucy means gotta get losing me in has to get nily yeah right yeah I mean get the one that looks like her the one you got in when Chinese OH pheromones there no no no she was obsessed with Niall ego true yeah where'd she get calf label maybe I guess because that's a big point they've done wait sorry did they yes or no they have done ultra buse they have not done those four beasts no okay all right we'll take a break when we come back we have some new Pokemon added to go and we didn't talk about this last week but the max raid stuff got switched around so we will be right back yeah yep [Music] get your pokemon sword and shield teams power up trainers you are about to face new guy gigantic Pokemon during well next raid battle period do we talk about this last week I don't think we did no we talked about that they were probably switching out but we didn't say what happened yeah so pokemon sword players you were more likely to encounter Giganta max colossal and Giganta max flap 'el while pokemon shield players you were more likely to encounter Giganta max Lapras and Giganta max appleton play both players are more likely to encounter Giganta max l creme a in both games I have somebody else Cryme that started on january 9th they have said that this goes until early February then I'm an exact date here on Pokemon calm but they have rotated the max raids I guess you could probably assume they're gonna rotate them again early February 14th I'll love dis crazy eye when this podcast goes up I will actually have a pretty handy graphic on social media whether that's like Twitter or slack or Instagram where if you're looking for specific alch Remy I've they actually do appear only in specific dem dens for example if you wanted the salted alfc Remy thing off the top of my head that is only five-star dens specifically in sword if you care about collecting all the flavours they are only strawberry but there are nine there are seven treats and there are nine flavors for every treat so like strawberry salted strawberry with Ruby swirl strawberry with rainbow swirl there's like clover and star but there's 63 what versions of them and then if you wanted the shinies with the treats that's another seven so altogether there are 70 but if you don't care about Chinese or 63 two of the Suites aren't in the game currently which is the ribbon suite and the star suite so keep that in mind don't know if that's like expansion past territory or what but those two suites are currently available in the game you get them at the top of the fighting dungeon yeah maybe based on your choices you'll get one and one only what we did what we didn't say last week we just kind of glossed over it I guess is if you don't decide to buy the expansion pass and somebody is doing a Slowking raid in the new area and the island of style of steel or whatever isle of armor genome is do if somebody is doing a dynamite said that you definitely talked about this loss who did we oh I was just gonna say if somebody's doing a Slowbro in the island of armor and you didn't buy the expansion you can still join in you don't have to purchase the expansion to do raids with people who do have the expansion they just have to host it which is awesome that's another another great thing that they did to allow that I will say for the the max raid stuff Steve your tip that you gave will last week his friends weren't able to connect to those magic heart braids and they didn't have Nintendo online and then you mentioned if you get wild area news it connects your switch to the internet and then that allows you to it like downloads the new raids from the server or whatever yeah that works perfectly a friend of mine didn't have what we were trying to figure that out a couple weeks ago why he couldn't see the promoted raids and I assumed it was because they were promoted and it was something he wasn't he hadn't downloaded somehow but that's exactly what work she doesn't have a Nintendo online the night that the podcast came out I listened to it I told him that and then he went and got the wild area news and then no problem he was raiding promoted raids without heating Nintendo homeland we can help people yeah so ever for the first time this podcast is solved with a least one problem we created 50 but we solved one there was so the there was an event for like extra dream balls in front balls and like love balls and stuff where you would enter codes and I think that was maybe like a month ago we talked about that in this podcast and I said you needed Nintendo online for that I was mistaken you need a my Nintendo account in order to redeem those let me try to explain this for I mean I'm sure most people have it but when you create your account on your switch you then link it to a Nintendo account which keeps track of your purchase history if you decide to buy like a digital game right so if you decide to buy Mario Odyssey you need some sort of account link to that profile to then verify that game purchase as well as you know giving Nintendo your information to track you your birthday that stuff so when I made a new account because I wanted to speedrun pokemon sword I didn't link it to anything so when I went to enter the code for the baseball the fastball in the lower ball it said that I needed to have my mind attend to account linked in order to get it which I assumed at the time was Nintendo online but if you just link an email to my Nintendo and then link it to that account you can then download those things for free that would be the same for the Giganta maxed meows that you needed you just need some sort of Nintendo account an email in order to get any of the mystery gifts but you don't need to you don't need to be paying $25 a year for a Nintendo online for the mystery gifts but you do need a little email linked to the account so there that was that was the mess up which is kind of annoying if you're just using an account to speedrun and you plan on deleting the account you're done did you if you were going to delete it out well you know you put the pokeballs on the pokémon you trade them out then you delete it oh so then you can cheater really yeah I did six and a half hours of work to get that master ball you better believe I'm moving them back to my main game six and a half hours some of us played for 40 hours before we weren't skipping around with some a high-level Pokemon we hacked in with our game shark speaking of wasting hours Latios and latias sit back in the special pencils weakened oh poor lot he has a lot yes one of them is good right one of them is yes oh well I'm not sure any secrets there these Aeon Pokemon are both the dragon and psychic types so it's best to bring other dragon-type pokémon like Rayquaza or dialga they're also weak to ice bug ghosts dark and fairy so we recommend you bringing Tyranitar togekiss or Mamoswine they will be appearing Friday January 24th to Monday January 27th for a special raid event weekend I mean this is the future of Pokemon go every weekend they were going to bring back so well once everything's released there will be a point in time when the antic will get to the end and then they will have to put hats on everything and bring back bring back man come on we've all caught count for Ash hat latias just you and me both and then speaking of to the end of the line more Pokemon originally discovered in the you know of a region and trade evolution Pokemon are being added Bobby do you want to explain this trade evolution this is something that probably should have been in the game since day one but God bless their hearts Nance I couldn't figure it out I guess she's not in a partnership with nan tech not yet you'll notice that tone will change I'm so proud of Niantic finally coming forward and figuring out a masterful way to have these bulk Irma yeah so trade Evo's basically there are I believe it only affects the four Jen one Pokemon that back in red and blue were the ones who needed to trade to evolve so you got gravel ur Machoke Kadabra and hunter want and there and then some Gen 5 Pokemon that they just released as well have the ability to have a trade evolution so how it works is you can still use candy to evolve your Pokemon will take Machamp for example you can still use a hundred candy to evolve much oak to Machamp but if the Machoke you have has been traded to you from another trainer the evolution from the choke to Machamp the always making that build of candy hey you never know it's trading matures you never know who um so that that there is no candy to evolve a traded Machoke to Machamp the catch here is that obviously you cannot trade your Pokemon back to yourself so your trade is trade ya you're trading them for your pokedex exactly exactly you're trading away the Machoke you have and I know we only we all only have one Machoke so be careful but yeah so that it takes the candy situation away to evolve it to Machamp now what they've done for the Gen 5 ones I can't remember off the top of my head have in the eyes it is allowed bold or girder she'll MIT and Hera blast okay so those all at least I know for sure bull door and and girder are two hundred candy to evolve and then but if you trade them than they are zero candy yeah care blossom another thing and there they say okay so feel I really trying to obviously push the trade Evo's for those but the the downside is is that when you get like timber is in raids right now it's only in raids and eggs you can't find timber in the wild so that means when you get a timber it's gonna have at least somewhat good Ivy's but it doesn't really matter cuz you need to trade it to evolve it to its final stage I guess in that case like II's don't really matter if that's what you're going for um you maybe want to be lucky friends with someone before you make those trades if you want something with good Ivy's or you just will have to grind out kind it out and get the two hundred candy okay if we just spent 45 minutes talking about a game that had come who required a lot of grind and really not DNA's fault as somebody who might be in the deep deep pockets of DNA we could maybe say all these games have great that's true this is true but I can walk with a thing and just earn candy that's true I mean in also in all seriousness I do like the trade evolution stuff I think it's a really cool mechanic that rewards you for going outside and meeting other people I think it's cool it's interesting I the fact that you can't trade it back is like now just trade boulder for Boulder who cares at that point right I mean that's the thing is I loved that ball door thank you I walked with that bowled over point to kilometer don't think anyone in history Pokemon go has ever been walking with a girder look we know somebody who is walking with the chinks so never say never that's picture let's keep the parameters open here a little bit lower here in case you didn't know about shell MIT and Kara she'll MIT the one with the helmet the one with the night helmet with a helmet yeah it becomes I'll sell gore the ninja and then Kara blasts the little tick looking bug becomes the the night with the Lance ass Cavalier and so you maybe would think like this is well this is like Gen 5 lore so maybe somebody didn't legend 5 and they just started listening the show like why did this happen the reason is because in the games you do have to specifically trade Cara blasts and she'll met with each other to evolve unlike other evolutions like bull door as long as you trade the bull door doesn't matter what you receive as long as you trade it it will evolve for Cara blessing shell mitt you specifically have to trade those two and in the trade process the lower is the cour the Cara blast steals the helmet during the trade and becomes a scav Alire because it's told the helmet and because shellman no longer has the helmet it becomes lean and thin and becomes very fast which makes it a sell Gore so there's the lore about those two Pokemon there is a fan theory that that was supposed to happen between Machoke & Gravel er that's why Machoke has two arms in Machamp has four arms and gravel ER has four arms but when it involves two golem it has two arms because the mud choke steals the arms but that's what hey this is it - its body oh hey Sarge you got there hey strong it just rips the two arms long gravel and Traveller and attaches the rocky stumps to its back that's like that's more of a Fame theory the one I told you about the car of lines in the show but is true that's true this nightmare sauce of choke jabbing that arms back into its body if you just walk up nice herbs you got there shame some happened to him in evolution if you want to be that person that corrects people a trades I do it is calm kelder not Conkeldurr which is the wrong way that I've said for many years con Cal there is how you say it as you concrete do you wanna if you want to be that person also there will be another trade evolution coming in the future you would assume now that this mechanic is in the game and that would be for phantom right there's probably another one I don't think I can't remember it but hands hump is the other must be traded to evolve Pokemon I like the way they did this gives the opportunity to trade but if you don't have anyone to trade with if you were just a solo player who likes it just find it out and play alone then you still have the opportunity to evolve but it's not taking that away from you although it is making you have to work harder since it's 200 candy to get them evolved but wow they also didn't introduce any 400 candy evolutions yet so maybe they won't well no larve s is not out Lord Vesta is 100 right right nope you're right yeah our best is definitely therefore in addition to bold or girder karabasan she'll met we have an exciting cast of more Pokemon that we might appearing in the wild rock and Rolla tympole dwell it's supposed to be like pebble level do you want to be that person try I am that person trubbish car blast Joel tick I actually don't know how to say car blast I may be saying that wrong kara blast Karl blast I'm not actually sure which one I don't know what kind of bug it's based off of the blast bug thank you very much my mistake Joel tick shell mitt and more you can hatch Venipede and dwell in two k eggs you can have those rock-and-roller RocknRolla time polt rubbish car blast Joel tick and shellman 5 K eggs timber poor toga Archon and axe you in 10 K eggs timber will be available in one-star raids and we have some more regional Pokemon here North America South America and Africa will have throw Europe Asia and Australia will have sock except for the first like 20 minutes that they're out and they were available all over the world I missed it I got a throw too though you got a throw oh I'm sorry I was like wait what sock is not here I did not get a sock I got a throw southern United States Mexico Central America the Caribbean and South America will get mer actus what yeah what do they mean by it ways southern United States no I think access I have to look at the chart again it's like some of Texas and some of Florida like corsola it's like the closest situation okay because doesn't say we there's no more actus here and I am we are as far as the United States goes we're just like your pretty pretty self you can make a run for the border there and pretty we have done that from that their very location Egypt and Greece gets sigilyph that's makes sense that's it that's like yeah constitutive the peers of the lousy desert part of black and white I'm out of the bog aim free cuz the man that desert part of black and white sucks it's it's always bad that the desert part of ultrasone altra moon is also real bad it is yeah it goes to it most people skip it and lost their that's the whole thing I am full disclosure in the pockets of big bass : you are eastern hemisphere red striped for masculine western hemisphere blue stripe form bass : have you got Steve zero I see them on my radio you know what we've talked about this before this game the antic I will provide you my email it may be in your pocket this game punishes you for catching pokémon let's give you an example when Bobby and I met and the Wolves howled in the moonshine when we met we used a non Pokemon go players phone to direct us to Pokemon because the game punished us for collecting lip we caught a liquid so it punished us and it never showed us where lit wick was but because our friend Brooke refused to play pokemon go yet had it installed on her phone it would always show us where the net the next lit lick was so every night we would ask her to open the game it would say the lit wick was at that stop Bobby and I and crew would walk to that stop she was no longer she was her attention span of Pokemon go was opening it for us to see and then she would close it and play moot play other games we'd get to the stop we catch the little ik we would then say Brooke can you open your game again we need to see the next lit wick and or other pokemon we need to catch and she would point us to the nuts lit wick but once you if you don't have that person you'll never know where it is so every night right now I'm looking at it every night near this Cemetery I see a furrow he's out there patrolling that cemetery every night I see him he's stomping on graves he's punching trees I know what he's doing what do you expect I see him out there every night but I know the minute I catch that throw I'll never know what he's doing I have tabs on the throw yeah but knee antic will punish me once I catch him I'll never know that he's out there kicking over gravestones if I catch him that's true they fix that so I'm on constant bass : control I know where they all are at all times but if I catch them then I don't I don't know what died no no trouble they're causing in the northern then the in the eastern hemisphere that's where we are once you've caught your assigned vascular the rest of them are no longer your problem you have picked up the one meant for you and you are in control of what that one does don't worry about the rest of the world they will deal with the other basket you find the one that matches your hurt Steve this isn't build-a-bear Greg when I go in there and stuff in a basket full of cotton this is what Danzig needs to do they need to have a like a radar feature because clearly it's in the game I can see the throw I always know where the throw is this catch the throw I'm not gonna throw guessed catch that throw have to be on a throw Patrol why is it hanging around you it clearly wants to join your team there needs to be a radar feature in the game where I can select like five pokemon and like ponary sigilyph Eevee Pikachu and throw and they are prioritized on my radar because I shouldn't have to depend on somebody who doesn't play the game to be like direct me like that I wasn't exaggerating with the story with Bobby and I hmm we went from lit wick to lit wick for like three hours they were out there so like I see a throw every single night on my radar without fail but I will probably never see another throw again on my radar once I catch it they need to add the habitat feature to the Pokedex like we haven't other games yeah I mean I don't know yeah I guess I mean what why do you okay so what that's just complicated for you antic that's what I'm drew dumb dumbing it down to let me sleep like five Pokemon the Pokedex they like have more priority on the radar why do you want to like hunt them down after you have the one ah Shani hunting or you're looking like I like right now I would probably select crabby just because I would like it good crabby and I would like more crabby candy so even though I why do i do want china crabby I think shiny crab he's great but crabby is one of the best water-type attackers in the game still I think because crime cameras very good yeah so it'd be nice to be like okay back up I would go out of my way like if I was downtown and it wasn't negative eight degrees and it was a nice day I would be as a player willing to walk farther if I knew a Pokemon I wanted was there so if I selected crabby and even though I have a million Crabbie's and I knew it was you know a quarter of a mile away that's us distance here Canadians I would walk that quarter of a mile because I know that a Pokemon I want is over there instead of just walking aimlessly being like well I hope something good is about to pop up and that is still exciting but if I'm specifically trying to grind out a specific Pokemon case-in-point people that might not have anyone to trade with and that would want maybe calm it like once they catch that shell mitt it's going to be significantly harder to find more shell myths yeah I mean I agree I just don't know I'm hesitantly agree uh-huh I just don't know I mean that's I guess that that's so different I guess from all the other games so you can't really compare to anything else it's like when you get like a peed of like here's here's another good example back when the Gen 5 dropped they dropped both Peeta I am tranquil and so if you if you it was very easy to get like five P dubs right there were everywhere bless their souls and soon as you got five you could evolve it and get tranquil but then tranquil got knocked off your radar so I would always see silhouettes of tranquil around because I never evolved my P dove and so that's what like the same with like Asha wat and Tepig and the third one that no one likes there's no point of evolving them because eventually I don't I don't think their evolutions are in the wild but they are okay they are the second tier is right so like if I want to do wat or pignite if I evolve my Tepig I get punished for that because I will never the like I will never see a wild a pig knight on the radar because now it's registered and now it doesn't prioritize it on my radar yeah I I don't know punishes punishes we aren't punished is the right word though because it's not you're telling me if you weren't laying in bed at like 11:00 p.m. and a big night silhouette popped up and you didn't have it you'd be like I had some it's only it's it's only like the stop sign down the street I'll go get it because that's exciting because you don't have it I definitely did that event there okay well I can't talk for you guys but I definitely did that with a Kara blast the other day I was on the it was at the polka stop down the street and I was sitting there with you know we were with my wife and son and I was like okay I gotta go the black bull right on the radar is the most exciting thing that Pokemon has ever brought - you're not you're not wrong every time a new gen comes out I tweet I love the silhouettes like it's it's the best but you're out of silhouettes that it just shows you the closest right or does it just shows you the closest it shows you the closest at the Polka stops that are available already other one that you can see on your map if you don't have the Pokemon it will go a little bit farther past that true yeah you'll usually it'll - many times Oh Archon is on nearby and then it's like off the map you can't even see the streets anymore how is that helpful what do you mean like if it's way off the map well you know what direction it is then once you get start getting closer to it then obviously all things show up all the liquids we were going for that night were pretty far away from each other but we got to everyone within so like I think a Pokemon last 20 minutes right on a stop before there's one 15 30 or 45 it's it's different based on the species I think oh I didn't know that but every lick we got to we got to in time except for that first one but we got distracted by a Lapras yes the lappers distracted everyone so when we got to lit like a despawn but a new one spawned so everyone after that we got to within the 20 minutes and they were pretty far away from each other but at least we knew which direction to walk in and where to go right it at least points you in the right direction and the the here's the thing so I guess it's can you could consider it being punished because the feature is there but I think that the idea is that the basic feature of the game is that it just shows you what's close and that it's just helping you if you don't have it yet right so like you're getting a little extra if you don't have it versus like I don't know I feel like being punished is a bit tough but I think the idea is is that you're supposed to go out and explore and I get the two stiller doing that if you because you know you come across everything else you come across on the way to the Pokemon and I would do the same if I could just choose a Pokemon and you know if it happens to be visible on my map it like shows or it would like tell me where where it is I would definitely go after it but I don't I just don't know if that's how Niantic wants to play the game yeah yeah yeah Steve yeah for it catch that vascular and then take each basket and that comes across your path as a gift take that crabby the one that you got and just deal with it that's your crabby Steve I don't know I I see your points do you don't know be nice do that to him I agree with him but it's no no no I I don't think that that should be added because I just feel like the whole so it took me I don't remember the exact number but I want to say somewhere in the realm of a hundred and fifty days from the day gibble was released to catch a gibble in the wild and while it was annoying and I saw I even saw had silhouettes sometimes but it was just you know I was going somewhere I didn't have the time to actually like veer off and go get it but 150 days and it was so exciting to catch that gibble and then like a couple last weekend I was down by the water and another one just spawned and it was so exciting that that happened like I feel like you take some of that excitement away which I think magnetic wants people to have maybe being able to go hunt any Pokemon at any time yeah maybe like where my situation is I like drove for hours to get to Gen Con and I parked my I dropped Irene off at Gen Con and then I had to park like six blocks away in a lot and I walked and million times faster than my wife so that's why I was like here you're here at the destination I will walk way faster than you and get back to the destination so that's fine and when I parked there was a gal bite that spawned it was the opposite direction of Gen Con so Gen Con was like six blocks south the gabite was like three blocks north and it was the final day of Gen Con and the doors were closing a little bit earlier than the other days and I've already committed four hours to drive down there so I can't it couldn't be like well let me take like I'm 20 minutes out of my way to walk this way I get the gabite then walk voices long back to the convention what I just spent four hours to get here and so now that I did hatch a give oh I'm never evolving my give all that will take away the silhouette of the gamma heat because I know gap might spawn the wild and once I see that silhouette I'm gonna do everything in my power to now get to that silhouette and catch it and then the problem is there yeah but the problem is yeah bite so hard to get right now they're delicate yeah right but I don't want to spend the gibble candy to get into the valve it took a bite to get rid of the silhouette when I need more gibble to get the Garchomp I'm saving myself twenty five candy guys for not above my gibble right through the gas bite you stop right now how many rare candies do you have a hundred and seventy-three Greg I checked this morning I used my rare candy Greg to power up my Mewtwo that you traded me that end up being lucky I put my heart and soul into this me too 500 rare candy no I'm not a Galvin a single I have enough to get to scolipede but I'm not evolving to Wartell Pete because I'm sure that of spawns in the wild I need the silver left in my life this life that you are living is a nightmare of your own making here okay the other thing has catch the throw catch the bascule and be at peace I get nothing I get nothing for evolving to scolipede except 25 candy down the drain that's all that's all that happens 25 scolipede candy that you aren't gonna use that's not true what if I can't what if I get a good skull Pete this is what always happens I use that good scalloping for what rain right now are you gonna be like look flexing your scolipede some of us have a skull Abid plush because it's actually a really cute pokémon it is but that doesn't help you in a max rate or a regular rate or any rate eventually it's a fairy type Pokemon fairies are weak to poison their banner poisons xerneas will show up in like two years the endings release and things if we're lucky where's my dirtiest shadow I don't see any on the map right now yeah but when that shadow shows up Greg I'll be like this is the one that I meant to catch this is the one that the universe wanted me to have did you never speak before we before twenty eight twenty thirty with a scolipede community day you'll have plenty of communities I I've just asked this real quick we there was I don't know if you know this Bobby but there was something in the code where they were saying like min Chino and chin Chino we're possibly shiny possibly did you hear anything about that or yeah miss yes is that it's supposed to be a community day or is that supposed to be like a fee bass day so I believe it supposed to be like a fee bass day and with Lunar New Year coming up and Niantic doing the Lunar New Year tweets right now like every day so that two days ago they just tweeted out the pic a picture or an emoji of a full moon so Cresselia is coming back after here and that's what you're saying yep sure and then after like yesterday they it was a you know three quarters and then today it was half and so I'm sure they're gonna make an announcement on Tuesday probably about the Lunar New Year event since the Lunar New Year starts January 25th so I think people are thinking there are no rats in the game right now it's a year of the rat coming up and there's no rats in the game that haven't been or that aren't shiny right now you know they like first year they did shiny Poochyena second year they did shiny splink you're the pig so yes you're the pig so this is your the metal rat so tomorrow in the game so people are thinking man Chino is gonna be associated during that event a nose on a rat oh yeah but if you look at the what they found the research tasks they're all based on catching Rattata Pikachu wait a minute that's all right either anyways yeah so I it really looks like it's not me love disco Lola bola are related they are in my heart um it looks like it's gonna be a special research day like Phoebus or something cuz there's a bunch of tasks that all end with catching em in Chino so what what it what is our February community today then the patterns are broken they're all done there's no more paranoia we've predicted those for two years straight we got the rods I did a prediction last month I did like uh like an edit I just put some different Pokemon into a picture and posted it on Instagram and in my prediction it was like gibble and then like literally six hours later they just surprise released SHINee gibble so my prediction is already completely thrown off I have no idea what they're gonna do next it's no arms gravel er weights are much higher life for this the other two are you aren't use of those you're just a ball gibeom uh no February I think so last February it was swine up which has related to the year the pig its togepi related cuz of cupid its togepi community today because it turns into togetic which i keep it shiny in the game but i wouldn't mind that at all I don't know I may be shiny Bidoof yeah that's - I mean B - vis tech well blob we all know Bidoof is a beaver it is technically classified as the plump mouse Pokemon right so missile yeah that's actually not awful it only has one another up you know one stage evolution but shinier a decade's they're here they're here with parties they already came and went with party hats I'm not coming back shiny Luna tones it's that did they didn't do star Lee yeah I guess I mean we don't well they haven't done like Bellsprout yet they haven't done there's some jello left that I'm surprised I haven't done yet well you can't well look this is the same company that didn't do ghastly during Halloween that's true but I will say they have somewhat kept a pattern alive right so because it was Pikachu and then it was I was a teeny there's no platters I don't know I don't know I mean the pattern was 10k eggs and then Eevee broke that and people were like well that doesn't count visit that this is everyone's always like then that doesn't count towards our pattern you're ruining our pattern get out of here with the Eevee and then swine up just hit him real hard and didn't have an excuse swine up didn't come from no 10k no but they was you're the pig so yeah see that one there was the excuse while I was here the pig that's why they like his why they did swine up because it was you're the pig yeah I guess my like there's no there's no more ten kegs at this point besides correct things that are extremely rare that they're not gonna give up at this point they're not gonna suddenly make gibble more common ah your ax you none of those are gonna become more common but I will say that in the game oh you better believe it's the year of goldfish Greg is it the Shaniqua fish just start and end the year the quill fish we get one day and that's all it deserves every time with shiny cool I mean they could do hop it if if they want to do a three-stage no that's gonna be April I think they'll do so we want to talk patterns for a second love matter the living patterns Jenny you told me there was gonna be two new V's cuz Jen to Hattie B's Jen for hat V's Jen six head V's gen8 gonna have V's you heard it here first yeah but they messed up the pattern because it was really they were deducting an Eevee every other generation oh I see in Gen 4 and then one in Gen 6 and 0 and Jenny math just falls apart here so anyways uh they didn't do they still did 10 days after swine hub right because it was like Bagon and then it was FLAC off at some point those are all community days I believe yes can't forget Ralts Ralts that yeah sure that broke pattern to that or that that was that was that was for evolutions not three but also they released Jen for last year but never went beyond gen 3 community dates okay so my guess is that they'll they won't go beyond Jen for community days this year okay Jen for has a big issue here because it's so small cuz that pokedex is garbage well but you've got I guess most of the things that evolve that got like that third stage evolution how already comes shiny yeah year of the tanker growth tanker Oh finally yeah oh that's just the one stage evolution though huh mmm year of the porygon oh that'll be yeah that's not oh yeah thank ya porygon yep that's it at some point that's it that's it we won that's Friday that's right very right that's Friday today yeah I don't know Steve what do you think porygon February it's kind of it's it's a silhouette or it's sorry it's shiny is Valentine's Day colors pink and purple yeah I'm if I got put money down I'm gonna say hop it's gonna be my guess first February yeah I could see horse fuel uh yeah yeah they did it they did an ice type Pokemon in February of 2000 I could you have got about one feel February of 2020 you know I played through all sir shield I don't remember this Pokemon name is feel I've never heard never seen this Pokemon before Whismur I'm just looking through what's what's got to stage they don't have I mean you don't have to do two stages though they could they could do uh what's another actual Mouse Pokemon though I'll actually do like the Bidoof that actually sounds like something they would do yeah I can hear it there was a whole central event wasn't there maybe yeah I'm sure yeah sure was promoted at one point by event I mean it was as China came out in the Sentra were increased I think yeah I think it will be like a man Chino special research day which I feel like could happen within the next couple weeks and then who knows for a February community today PD would be fun let's do that Bidoof yeah let's do Bidoof let's go Niantic reddit continues to say Ralts we say be still oh sure I don't know this time they're all male seeing effect laid us first reddit yeah I don't know I you know honestly though like Minchin ochin Chino would be fine for community I think but if they're gonna do you like some special event that's cool too I suppose yeah well it's just cuz what they found were so many research tasks that were the end of the research task was catch him in Chino or whatever or like though sorry the reward was him in Chino oh and and those research tasks were related around like cash five Rattata or like catch my Pikachu or of all they were they really related with mouse and rat type Pokemon or an eccentric was one of them as well so like rodents squirrel which I don't know type Pokemon so I think that is gonna be some somehow tied into the Lunar New Year event and I'm assuming as they've done with the past special research field research days they've introduced the shiny with that so I could see them doing gin Chino and then having its shiny erm in Chino and having a shiny released wheedle community today if you're lucky trainers ooh you know who they haven't done yet who a lot of people have asked for is Rhyhorn a Rhyhorn community today ah round would be cool I like Rhyhorn I like the good ol rhyperior yeah yeah it's definitely that maybe like the only yeah right ear ear and I think the ketha key are the only Gen 4 Evo's from the previous gens that don't have nosepass or Provo past doesn't have their shiny and game yet I don't think anyone's get another chair for a Provo pass or know that gold that gold knows pass looking pretty good pretty good oh they could do Happiny oh they don't do babies oh come on no I thought it was already oh wait let's transition this chase is not shiny yet no think it's the only baby Pokemon that in chingling aren't shiny yet Oh a real there's a bunch of them are Chinese there's not a bunch of babies aren't shining it they're running out of Chinese not only is an antic running out of the end of the Pokedex they are running out of Chinese well that's what keeps their game going right I'm very invested in this like in game of Pokemon can run out of things em yeah yeah I don't see any other I don't know I'm pretty sure I think they'll stick with the three-tier stuff so far I mean there's some feel like there's a lot of them if they haven't done yet so I don't think they're gonna I don't think they'll go away from that to like a two-tier pokémon species yet the only mean and the only one was Pikachu so far and that's just because it's Pikachu so obviously had to go first just kecleon yeah that'd be nice to get kecleon eventually in-game they're all invisible this is the worst community today they're there you just can't find them randomly hit around the screen until something happens I really thought they'd do kecleon with a ghost snapshot thing eventually like set out some your goal and throw kecleon in there but they already have again it's invisible yes 13 in the game since Melton yep actually it has right when some people accidentally catching kecleon yeah there was like a ring weird area where part of there was a there was a region I feel like where when Melton was known as the like but it was still it was still turning into ditto but left sometimes instead of melt and popping up it was kecleon popping up and then it would turn into a ditto I remember this oh yeah I remember that so much chaos all right here here's the curveball that this is another 50 minute segment strap on in Oh February Community Day is a gen 8 Pokemon no well they did the wiesen they did the wheezing and they do have spoilers to people who don't want to know this but they do have Zigzagoon and Linoone in the gallery' importance in the code as well as they're Chinese they're in the game so Zigzagoon close enough to a mime rat yes I mean okay if they're gonna they're talking in Chino let's let's throw Zigzagoon all right cancel it I love Zigzagoon by the way I'm hilarious legs again as February community that's their that's my boy I have no idea but I am not making any bets rbdr Bellsprout all right horn or any of the ones that it could be that here's my bet it's all though that's all the ones that it could be interesting to them interesting take I like this bold predictions I'm making a stand on it's in the code trivia here I googled rat Pokemon got a picture of rat a toes head on a miltank body quality podcasts question of the week Greg give me a second to recover from the rat Milt egghead bro visit we just redid protecting okay bill tada oh I like militate Brandon Stewart James sent in some new stuff here we're gonna get to that next week yeah my doing my question that we're doing question Louie all right ready which was better sword or shield would you go camping in the slumbering Weald questions from slack that we answer back question of the week Miranda and what is your favorite side story in a Pokemon game for example Wally's journey in generation three is really prominent wait that's not a side story that's like that main story Vader well I suppose if you consider the villain plot the main story then yeah sure but it's interesting to see a character overcome their sickness and become one of the best wait was while I sleep with maybe it was a side-lying maybe I didn't pay attention he was sick yes life what if he was sick of life I think we're all ill Wally needed fresh air like he had to move because he was having trouble breathing so uncle and dad feel bad about laughing on I don't know that they ever state what he was sick with it was just one of those oh he needs to be by the sea because he's sick and weak and then he isn't I don't know that they ever actually said what the illness was I despite his illness it while he's young sickly but yeah they don't say he's just sick his illness has never explained but it is probably either bronchitis but could be asthma listen II he has appropriate yeah I'm looking yeah as Ellis has never explained but his symptoms appeared to clear up in clean air suggesting that is either acute bronchitis or asthma get-get him inhaler I don't know if this counts as a side story but I like I like how Olli Ana's Pokemon tell a story did what is but is the story tell us the story Oh like she's a strong female character and so she has strong female Pokemon but her last Pokemon is a gar border because she lived in poverty until chairman Rose saved her all right pretty good hey it's not a side story but no no I mean either he's your rival the advisor I said that somebody before the Elite Four you have battlin before the leaf for odorous you do run into him in thing but what's her name who's the character's name in Ruby or shields is the Yampa your shield Ruby or shield my favorite version is the Ruby Ruby and Sapphire it's not dawn Dunson platinum fighting a visit but may it's not me Brennan and me that's Brendon man's may Mays your rival now while he's a rival rival to bothers your other rival my folk a favorite Stein's side story is learning how to dang it I stole my thunder ah I knew where you're going yeah story is good it's mmm there's nothing good about any of X story okay Trevor no no Serena Serena story I mean big board oh my favorite one while he is my favorite character from the emerald emerald series like I love what I love running into all you multiple times I don't think I do think he is mostly a side story since the main story is stopping world devastation I'm carrying his illness I don't know I don't think okay sure what about to the side story what about this is a small one but and I'm gonna sound like a real gen winner here there we go the cubone marowak mmm overplayed stuff nice you can tell me the Lion King is good okay calm down all right get Irene on the phone right now yeah play that part back see what happens the keyboard stuff is fine they keep on stuff here okay Jen huan'er look he won stuff was a million times better and let's go because your rival then takes the cubone that's actually no I was gonna say it was the let's go version is actually a good side story I really like yes yeah also lion Kings great I'll say the best part about Jen 3 is Pico what [Laughter] he goes pretty good yeah pika where there is our Pico distribution how do we feel about Koga and Janene story is that a good side story is out of sight it's a side story yeah I mean it's fine that a good one never read I mean you know while he's Giotto wasn't good enough to have their own Elite Four so they had recycle a lot of kantos elite four because Joe chose all Jen winners yeah they knew they were inferior and they just stopped trying halfway through game are there any a Lola side stories that are good yes the best a lowland side story is realizing that nanu is a crazy cat man and has a million meows and it's very good do we like that's pretty good why Canton look you know all looker stories are weird Kakui no the bet has to go spot Guzman Guzman is Guzman side story good is it a sad story well you learn a lot about him yeah yeah but it's not like anything you're forced to do is not a side story like you're forced to fight Wally a million times we Chanukah the story in your face but it's not the it's not the end goal of the game right right like it is a it's a it's a little side mission I'm not talking Wally but like the Guzman thing isn't it's a side yeah I think out more about Kuzma is definitely a side story sure yeah yeah yeah I don't know I didn't I don't remember or Azure Ruby and sapphires postgame enough to know if there's more about Wally after you beat Wally No I don't remember anything more about Wally I mean you ran into him a lot like you can fight Wally multiple times but yeah I mean Guzman fine what about rainbow rocket is that a side story or is that not a side story postgame house came content cuz yeah I would say that's postgame not side to this was an all true not to do postgame okay how about this is it a side story that in let's go home a side story oak and drag and they don't touch on it but we all know that that's true rainbow rocket is boy rainbow rocket is like fine I don't think I don't think it sells a forty dollar game story sure yeah well there's nothing main sorry to sell the game I don't think any of Pokemon story sells the game you don't like stories no I like story yeah oh my gosh it's Lion King Hamlet they just added hyenas do you do you even know the plot of Hamlet yeah the dude kills the other dude tries to marry the mom what Greg doesn't right he doesn't try he does but there's no part it would Hamlet flees Denmark to live with two other random animals and then comes back it's like I'm gonna save everybody yes okay it means no worries seriously get a text I read about this whole Lion King thing and we texture texture belated happy birthday from me as well okay the problem with laden can fans you act like it's some original story hmm all right the best part about nothing no story is original so I don't know I've never seen another story where a 10 12 year-old green haired boy climbs into a ferris wheel with you and tells you about the world effing have you never seen Macbeth I don't remember any hair being green speaking of movies we haven't seen I still haven't watched the power of us made it okay the best part about rainbow rocket is when chorus comes out of no is Congress is not a side story choruses of main story up right yeah you are forced to interact with chorus yes is it platinum yes chorus is black and white so coerced is big in black white too yes alright I'm there I'll it's late and they're all mixing in my brain I don't have time to go to worship her all right well that correct I said you have to wait till next week for Pokemon of the week
