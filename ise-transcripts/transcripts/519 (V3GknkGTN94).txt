super effective i'm your host steve with (0:28 - 0:33)
me is greg hello hello hello it's a (0:30 - 0:36)
lovely burning hot weekend (0:33 - 0:37)
in theory because we're doing this on a (0:36 - 0:39)
friday (0:37 - 0:41)
starting off pride (0:39 - 0:43)
weekend (0:41 - 0:46)
in the right way it's 98 degrees so (0:43 - 0:47)
therefore you should be wearing no (0:46 - 0:49)
clothing (0:47 - 0:50)
well we know it's pride because there's (0:49 - 0:54)
a community day tomorrow yep (0:50 - 0:56)
absolutely rude (0:54 - 0:59)
will is also here and according to steve (0:56 - 1:01)
and greg i am a toxic work environment (0:59 - 1:02)
so (1:01 - 1:04)
correct (1:02 - 1:06)
you get what you pay for i am just (1:04 - 1:09)
reporting what the rumors say (1:06 - 1:10)
i love rumors (1:09 - 1:13)
uh we have a bunch of little pokemon (1:10 - 1:15)
news to go through today (1:13 - 1:18)
um just sprinkling a bunch of stuff here (1:15 - 1:19)
and there (1:18 - 1:21)
i (1:19 - 1:23)
did get back from the milwaukee (1:21 - 1:25)
regionals and as we're recording this (1:23 - 1:28)
the north america (1:25 - 1:29)
international championships are (1:28 - 1:30)
happening (1:29 - 1:33)
which if you have been to a regionals (1:30 - 1:36)
and then you look at the um (1:33 - 1:38)
the footage of the (1:36 - 1:39)
north america (1:38 - 1:41)
international championships there's a (1:39 - 1:44)
big difference in production value (1:41 - 1:47)
they definitely care about their ics (1:44 - 1:49)
more than it's fine um i i had a great (1:47 - 1:51)
time at regionals maybe we could talk (1:49 - 1:53)
about that for a little bit (1:51 - 1:55)
i i i think though the news we will (1:53 - 1:58)
start off with is news that is is (1:55 - 2:00)
no longer relevant unfortunately but (1:58 - 2:02)
would have been nice to know i don't (2:00 - 2:05)
know if the pokemon company ever gave us (2:02 - 2:07)
like a week heads up of any of these (2:05 - 2:10)
events and i'm pretty sure i said last (2:07 - 2:11)
week (2:10 - 2:14)
on the podcast i said i'm going to end (2:11 - 2:16)
up going to milwaukee and some new raid (2:14 - 2:18)
event thing is going to happen and it (2:16 - 2:20)
did and it was actually a pretty cool (2:18 - 2:22)
raid event (2:20 - 2:23)
um (2:22 - 2:26)
and i could not participate because i (2:23 - 2:27)
was (2:26 - 2:29)
doing tournaments and i was traveling (2:27 - 2:32)
and i was in a hotel room um but (2:29 - 2:34)
there was a reason for this (2:32 - 2:37)
uh this was june 17th challenge (2:34 - 2:42)
gigantomax urshifu and max raid battles (2:37 - 2:44)
um until june 19th until five o'clock (2:42 - 2:47)
pdt gigantomax urshifu single strike and (2:44 - 2:49)
gigantomax irshifu rapid strike will (2:47 - 2:51)
appear in raid dance more often (2:49 - 2:53)
although the wushu pokemon won't give (2:51 - 2:55)
you a chance to catch them you will be (2:53 - 2:57)
rewarded with valuable items you (2:55 - 2:58)
normally don't receive from max raid (2:57 - 3:00)
battles (2:58 - 3:02)
the valuable items were actually really (3:00 - 3:05)
good you it gave you like one of every (3:02 - 3:08)
apricorn ball per battle and it gave you (3:05 - 3:11)
uh a bunch of uh xl and large (3:08 - 3:13)
experienced candy and also a bunch of (3:11 - 3:16)
dinite ore and armorite ore like the ink (3:13 - 3:19)
incredible rewards okay so this was in (3:16 - 3:20)
sword and shield (3:19 - 3:21)
yes (3:20 - 3:23)
all right because when you say raids i (3:21 - 3:25)
immediately think pokemon go oh sorry (3:23 - 3:27)
yeah yeah this was the this is unsworn (3:25 - 3:30)
shield the wushu pokemon um so the (3:27 - 3:33)
reason that that urshifu was in raid (3:30 - 3:36)
battles the the lore reason was it was (3:33 - 3:39)
to celebrate the two years it has been (3:36 - 3:42)
two years since the isle of armor has (3:39 - 3:43)
come out (3:42 - 3:45)
that is insane (3:43 - 3:46)
to think about (3:45 - 3:48)
um (3:46 - 3:50)
i know it's like that's the passage of (3:48 - 3:53)
time that's that's what we do here we (3:50 - 3:58)
exist in five is a blur four dimensions (3:53 - 3:58)
um (3:58 - 4:02)
so yeah it was it was pretty much uh all (4:00 - 4:03)
the promoted raids were a hundred (4:02 - 4:06)
percent urshifu there was no (4:03 - 4:09)
it could be shiny but again you couldn't (4:06 - 4:11)
catch these pokemon (4:09 - 4:13)
and unlike there was that the zero aura (4:11 - 4:16)
raid event and the shiny zero aura was (4:13 - 4:19)
tougher it was like designed that way (4:16 - 4:20)
um (4:19 - 4:22)
this was just probably them forgetting (4:20 - 4:24)
to turn off (4:22 - 4:25)
the shiny (4:24 - 4:27)
not that it mattered (4:25 - 4:30)
but what incredible rewards like what (4:27 - 4:32)
i'm so mad i miss this raid event (4:30 - 4:34)
weekend literally you're getting one of (4:32 - 4:35)
every apricorn you're getting a bunch of (4:34 - 4:38)
xl candy a bunch of dionite or a bunch (4:35 - 4:40)
of armorite ore um you didn't have to (4:38 - 4:42)
like waste wishing pieces resetting (4:40 - 4:44)
because you were just hitting these to (4:42 - 4:47)
like burn through them with with friends (4:44 - 4:50)
uh and again i just (4:47 - 4:53)
no heads up he always got a choice band (4:50 - 4:55)
and you always got a choice you need (4:53 - 4:57)
those choice bands i have like three of (4:55 - 5:00)
them now because i did three raids (4:57 - 5:01)
ah (5:00 - 5:02)
does this mean that they're gonna do (5:01 - 5:04)
something to celebrate the two year (5:02 - 5:08)
anniversary of crown tundra i don't know (5:04 - 5:10)
is this going to come back maybe are (5:08 - 5:11)
they still done with rainbows all the (5:10 - 5:13)
gallerian birds but they won't be (5:11 - 5:15)
catchable (5:13 - 5:16)
you know (5:15 - 5:19)
that's probably what they'll do honestly (5:16 - 5:21)
i mean it was the big thing that (5:19 - 5:24)
happened right yeah i was thinking like (5:21 - 5:25)
what pokemon would they feature but yeah (5:24 - 5:27)
it would probably be the birds (5:25 - 5:28)
um (5:27 - 5:31)
yeah good call (5:28 - 5:32)
it (5:31 - 5:33)
they're still not done with the right (5:32 - 5:35)
events this is a brand like i i thought (5:33 - 5:37)
at this point we'd be coasting to (5:35 - 5:40)
scarlet and violet with with repeat rate (5:37 - 5:42)
events but this was a brand new one kind (5:40 - 5:44)
of coasting (5:42 - 5:46)
true (5:44 - 5:48)
it was a cool event though good event i (5:46 - 5:50)
mean the rewards were good you couldn't (5:48 - 5:51)
catch it though and the amount of people (5:50 - 5:53)
that were bitter about it not being (5:51 - 5:55)
catchable were numerous (5:53 - 5:57)
yeah i mean that was the same for me too (5:55 - 5:59)
but the music i thought the mewtwo (5:57 - 6:01)
rights were so fun uh and the zero (5:59 - 6:03)
horror raids i thought were fun too (6:01 - 6:05)
the ones that i did they were fun but (6:03 - 6:06)
again every time i go back to sword and (6:05 - 6:08)
shield and i try to use the white comb i (6:06 - 6:09)
get so (6:08 - 6:11)
mad yeah it's (6:09 - 6:13)
so bad (6:11 - 6:15)
it's not great you're not wrong oh it's (6:13 - 6:18)
so frustrating that's why they didn't (6:15 - 6:20)
add any multiplayer in legends because (6:18 - 6:22)
then you couldn't complain about it (6:20 - 6:23)
yeah there are other things to complain (6:22 - 6:26)
about (6:23 - 6:28)
uh okay well that that right event (6:26 - 6:31)
happened uh i hope they repeat it maybe (6:28 - 6:32)
in the future (6:31 - 6:35)
um do more because i mean again you're (6:32 - 6:38)
giving away things at the end of the (6:35 - 6:40)
game's life that are just (6:38 - 6:41)
like (6:40 - 6:44)
you know here have all the things (6:41 - 6:47)

uh has occurred either usually that (9:03 - 9:08)
happens in august or september however (9:06 - 9:11)
the next rotation will not occur until (9:08 - 9:13)
early 2023 (9:11 - 9:15)
this means (9:13 - 9:18)
yeah this means cards with the d (9:15 - 9:21)
regulation mark the letter d (9:18 - 9:23)
the big old d not the lucky d (9:21 - 9:25)

squarespace judge (12:12 - 12:18)
some people didn't even hear that ad (12:15 - 12:20)

horrible music that gets thrown in when (12:20 - 12:25)
you don't get to hear the wonderful ads (12:22 - 12:28)

it (14:03 - 14:07)
is it the shadow realm and uh yeah (14:05 - 14:08)
kettle realm you can sometimes get out (14:07 - 14:11)
of if you know the combo but oh okay got (14:08 - 14:13)
it we need to make sure we hit our one (14:11 - 14:16)
one so episode yu-gi-oh corta oh i've (14:13 - 14:18)
got something to say about that (14:16 - 14:21)
i i am thinking (14:18 - 14:24)
you know pokemon card prices have have (14:21 - 14:26)
have uh (14:24 - 14:28)
gone down situated (14:26 - 14:32)
fluctuated down (14:28 - 14:34)
usually though sometimes there are sets (14:32 - 14:37)
that are mechanical based um i think a (14:34 - 14:38)
really good (14:37 - 14:42)
set that is mechanical based was uh (14:38 - 14:44)
battle styles (14:42 - 14:47)
but but those sets are also (14:44 - 14:49)
sometimes there sometimes it's both but (14:47 - 14:50)
um (14:49 - 14:53)
those sets don't really have like (14:50 - 14:58)
really go-to expensive cards (14:53 - 15:00)
and this looks like a set that doesn't (14:58 - 15:03)
have anything super expensive standing (15:00 - 15:05)
out at least from what they're featuring (15:03 - 15:08)
like magna zone drapion his suing goodra (15:05 - 15:10)
hissuians are jesus and zoroark probably (15:08 - 15:12)
going to be the most expensive card just (15:10 - 15:14)
based off what they're promoting i'm (15:12 - 15:16)
sure if i went to the japanese list and (15:14 - 15:17)
looked at all the cards maybe there's a (15:16 - 15:19)
standout zoroark (15:17 - 15:21)
in the past (15:19 - 15:23)
always has been usually a staple card (15:21 - 15:27)
always usually very good um but this is (15:23 - 15:29)
hissuian's or ark that's true but you (15:27 - 15:31)
know i'm not seeing any charizards i'm (15:29 - 15:33)
not seeing any pikachus uh they're (15:31 - 15:35)
reintroducing the lost zone (15:33 - 15:37)
um so just like (15:35 - 15:39)
battle styles introducing rapid strike (15:37 - 15:42)
and single strike i can't remember what (15:39 - 15:43)
they were called (15:42 - 15:45)
um rapid style maybe it was just called (15:43 - 15:48)
rapid style single straw (15:45 - 15:49)
uh (15:48 - 15:51)
yeah i think it was rapid style and (15:49 - 15:53)
single strike (15:51 - 15:55)
um (15:53 - 15:57)
it doesn't seem like this is th this is (15:55 - 16:00)
like a uh (15:57 - 16:00)
a set that you're you're buying and then (16:00 - 16:03)
you're trying to like flip cards out of (16:02 - 16:05)
but you know who knows (16:03 - 16:08)
and also what you meant to say was sets (16:05 - 16:09)
that are (16:08 - 16:13)
mechanic based yes based on a mechanic (16:09 - 16:14)
not mechanical (16:13 - 16:18)
they're based on a mechanic robot cards (16:14 - 16:19)
uh (16:18 - 16:20)
it could be (16:19 - 16:22)
tran is there a transformers tcg there (16:20 - 16:24)
has to be right there is there it's (16:22 - 16:27)
cancelled there was it was there was i (16:24 - 16:29)
have a box (16:27 - 16:31)
like i'm literally pointing to my (16:29 - 16:33)
optimist prime box right up there (16:31 - 16:34)
[Music] (16:33 - 16:36)
whoever it was maybe it was bumble bee i (16:34 - 16:38)
don't know (16:36 - 16:38)
um (16:38 - 16:41)
but i mean what you're saying makes (16:43 - 16:47)
sense because if a set is based around a (16:44 - 16:49)
certain mechanic then the cards included (16:47 - 16:51)
in it aren't sufficiently versatile to (16:49 - 16:52)
be included (16:51 - 16:55)
in sets that aren't (16:52 - 16:58)
driven off of that same mechanic (16:55 - 16:58)
yeah they're they're um (16:59 - 17:03)
it looks like there is a cramer ant that (17:02 - 17:05)
has to do with the lost zone so that's (17:03 - 17:08)
pretty exciting (17:05 - 17:09)
probably won't be good but you know (17:08 - 17:12)
crime aren't getting another card (17:09 - 17:13)
uh (17:12 - 17:16)
i think i've missed every format that (17:13 - 17:18)
was lost zone based (17:16 - 17:21)
i think when i came into the tcg around (17:18 - 17:23)
black and white (17:21 - 17:24)
uh well it wasn't (17:23 - 17:26)
i did come into the tcg around black and (17:24 - 17:27)
white (17:26 - 17:30)
um lawson was getting rotated out from (17:27 - 17:33)
the heart gold soul silver era (17:30 - 17:34)
and then (17:33 - 17:36)
i want to say they introduced the lost (17:34 - 17:39)
zone again was that near the end of (17:36 - 17:42)
black 2 white 2 or sometime in x and y (17:39 - 17:44)
where i i quit i stopped playing it must (17:42 - 17:46)
have been x and y because there was no (17:44 - 17:49)
loss zone any time that i was playing (17:46 - 17:50)
because you played a little bit longer (17:49 - 17:52)
than i did (17:50 - 17:55)
i only played into x and y (17:52 - 17:58)
yeah i i started x and y (17:55 - 18:01)
i played until plasma freeze (17:58 - 18:03)
and then i came back for maybe one or (18:01 - 18:06)
two x and y tournaments (18:03 - 18:06)
um (18:06 - 18:08)
and i don't remember any lost zone in (18:06 - 18:12)
the sun and moon series (18:08 - 18:12)
but (18:13 - 18:16)
anyways this they've had lost on a (18:14 - 18:19)
couple times on and off so (18:16 - 18:19)
some people like it some people don't (18:21 - 18:23)
you know (18:22 - 18:25)
it is definitely a mechanic that's for (18:23 - 18:27)
sure (18:25 - 18:29)
i mean some things you can't get rid of (18:27 - 18:31)
unless it says put it into exile so i (18:29 - 18:33)
get it (18:31 - 18:34)
when will has his (18:33 - 18:36)
horrible things out that can't be (18:34 - 18:38)
destroyed look you have to hit him to (18:36 - 18:40)
exile this this that's not how pokemon (18:38 - 18:43)
works (18:40 - 18:43)
i went to the milwaukee regionals uh you (18:45 - 18:51)
know i've been to probably (18:48 - 18:54)
20 plus regionals uh almost all of them (18:51 - 18:57)
were tcg focused although the tcg and (18:54 - 19:00)
the vgc are in the same hall (18:57 - 19:01)
so it's not like that's that much (19:00 - 19:02)
different you're either going to the (19:01 - 19:05)
left-hand side of the right-hand side (19:02 - 19:07)
i will say though you know even even as (19:05 - 19:11)
a tcg player i i would have friends or (19:07 - 19:12)
um (19:11 - 19:13)
acquaintances (19:12 - 19:17)
doing the vgc and it always seemed like (19:13 - 19:21)
it was just as much of a mess as it was (19:17 - 19:22)
the tcg (19:21 - 19:25)
and this was (19:22 - 19:27)
easily the smoothest (19:25 - 19:29)
tournament i've ever been to (19:27 - 19:33)
um we were supposed to start uh at nine (19:29 - 19:36)
there was uh 216 people who signed up (19:33 - 19:37)
for the masters (19:36 - 19:39)
and (19:37 - 19:42)
183 of them actually showed up (19:39 - 19:44)
which is you know you know travel (19:42 - 19:46)
happens you know plans change people get (19:44 - 19:47)
sick (19:46 - 19:50)
and it was eight rounds which is a lot (19:47 - 19:52)
of rounds to play the video game best (19:50 - 19:53)
two out of three (19:52 - 19:55)
we were supposed to start at nine of (19:53 - 19:56)
course (19:55 - 19:58)
a handful of people were not ready (19:56 - 20:00)
because you had to set up some weird (19:58 - 20:01)
land mode on your switch (20:00 - 20:02)
um (20:01 - 20:05)
and so we started at 9 20. (20:02 - 20:07)
we had a lunch break right at one (20:05 - 20:10)
o'clock that went to two o'clock (20:07 - 20:13)
um i did what i i look i did what i did (20:10 - 20:15)
that i normally that i told myself i (20:13 - 20:17)
would never do i will never wait for (20:15 - 20:19)
anyone else in the entire world for my (20:17 - 20:21)
lunch break as soon as i'm done with (20:19 - 20:23)
that match i'm getting lunch i'm not (20:21 - 20:25)
waiting for you i can't depend on how (20:23 - 20:29)
long you're taking i need to eat (20:25 - 20:31)
i got more matches in the day everyone (20:29 - 20:33)
is on their own for lunch break in the (20:31 - 20:35)
past i would always wait for people it (20:33 - 20:36)
would never work (20:35 - 20:39)
uh too many people trying to get a table (20:36 - 20:41)
just everyone's on their own for lunch (20:39 - 20:43)
it worked out for me i got lunch (20:41 - 20:45)
uh i talked to greg during my lunch (20:43 - 20:47)
break it was great and then i went back (20:45 - 20:48)
and did four more matches (20:47 - 20:51)
oh i see i see (20:48 - 20:53)
i see okay (20:51 - 20:56)
noted noted (20:53 - 20:59)
and i'm the toxic work environment okay (20:56 - 21:02)
i was building the hr complaints well i (20:59 - 21:03)
work in hr (21:02 - 21:06)
yeah we already also discussed hr is (21:03 - 21:08)
there for the business not for the (21:06 - 21:09)
employee (21:08 - 21:10)
yes (21:09 - 21:11)
uh (21:10 - 21:17)
it was a very smooth tournament um (21:11 - 21:19)
it was great i i had a good time you (21:17 - 21:22)
know for people people ask they they say (21:19 - 21:24)
like is it worth going to a regionals if (21:22 - 21:26)
you're not competing (21:24 - 21:27)
um (21:26 - 21:29)
and that's kind of a hard question (21:27 - 21:31)
because uh (21:29 - 21:34)
i i think the answer is is unless you (21:31 - 21:37)
live in that city or maybe an hour away (21:34 - 21:39)
i think the answer is no (21:37 - 21:41)
there there are stages there they did (21:39 - 21:43)
have a pogo stage they did have a tcg (21:41 - 21:46)
stage they did have a vgc stage they had (21:43 - 21:46)
you know (21:46 - 21:49)
20 30 chairs sitting in front so you (21:46 - 21:50)
could watch and they had tv so you could (21:49 - 21:52)
you could watch (21:50 - 21:53)
um (21:52 - 21:54)
and they had (21:53 - 21:57)
at the regional level they have vendors (21:54 - 21:59)
so this this case they had four vendors (21:57 - 22:01)
they were all (21:59 - 22:03)
they were all tcg vendors and some of (22:01 - 22:06)
them had plushes or japanese import (22:03 - 22:08)
goods um like some of those toys you can (22:06 - 22:09)
only get in japan (22:08 - 22:12)
everything there is overpriced of course (22:09 - 22:13)
um (22:12 - 22:15)
but (22:13 - 22:17)
they're not huge vendors right like you (22:15 - 22:19)
you go to the vendor aisle and there's (22:17 - 22:21)
four of them and unless you like to buy (22:19 - 22:24)
single cards or sell cards they're (22:21 - 22:25)
pretty limited in what they have (22:24 - 22:27)
merchandise wise so you can pretty much (22:25 - 22:31)
see all of that within maybe 20 minutes (22:27 - 22:32)
and there are side events and that (22:31 - 22:34)
depends if you like to do side events or (22:32 - 22:36)
not (22:34 - 22:37)
but that's pretty much it (22:36 - 22:40)
that's kind of all there is to it so you (22:37 - 22:42)
know if if you're in the area i think (22:40 - 22:45)
it's worth probably going and maybe (22:42 - 22:48)
seeing the finals but you can (22:45 - 22:49)
now that everything is almost streamed (22:48 - 22:52)
on twitch or youtube you can just watch (22:49 - 22:54)
those matches (22:52 - 22:55)
in the comfort of your own home and hear (22:54 - 22:59)
the commentators and not worry about (22:55 - 23:00)
being around (22:59 - 23:01)
people (23:00 - 23:05)
if if you're anti-social (23:01 - 23:07)
at a international level (23:05 - 23:09)
like if you were to go to ohio this past (23:07 - 23:11)
weekend they do have an official pokemon (23:09 - 23:14)
center and it's pretty large (23:11 - 23:15)
um (23:14 - 23:17)
i don't know if they i'm sure they have (23:15 - 23:18)
side events i know for sure they have (23:17 - 23:21)
side events but i i i don't know if (23:18 - 23:23)
there's anything more to that (23:21 - 23:25)
uh there is like the nice thing now that (23:23 - 23:28)
pokemon go has existed (23:25 - 23:30)
um because i i've been to regionals and (23:28 - 23:31)
i've been to worlds without pokemon go (23:30 - 23:33)
but now that pokemon goes existed you (23:31 - 23:35)
see you see the whole venue normally lit (23:33 - 23:37)
up with lures usually if there's raids (23:35 - 23:38)
people are jumping in because you're (23:37 - 23:40)
just surrounded by pokemon fans (23:38 - 23:41)
so (23:40 - 23:44)
in that instance um (23:41 - 23:46)
it's nice but (23:44 - 23:48)
i had a good time there was a bunch of (23:46 - 23:50)
people that came up and asked if if will (23:48 - 23:52)
and greg were there i was like no (23:50 - 23:53)
they're not (23:52 - 23:55)
um but there there were there were so (23:53 - 23:56)
many people that came up and said they (23:55 - 23:59)
love the podcast so if if you stopped me (23:56 - 24:01)
uh i'm sorry if i (23:59 - 24:02)
i'm sorry if i was getting pulled in (24:01 - 24:04)
every direction i tried to say hi to (24:02 - 24:06)
everyone and try to talk to people (24:04 - 24:08)
sometimes i would like start talking to (24:06 - 24:09)
somebody and then somebody would tap my (24:08 - 24:10)
shoulder and i would turn around and i (24:09 - 24:12)
would say hi and then i would turn back (24:10 - 24:14)
around and that person would be gone and (24:12 - 24:15)
i get it because everyone's trying to (24:14 - 24:17)
like run to their matches and get their (24:15 - 24:19)
stuff done but i do really appreciate (24:17 - 24:20)
everyone who like (24:19 - 24:21)
said hello or said they liked the (24:20 - 24:25)
podcast it meant it meant a lot (24:21 - 24:25)
um unfortunately (24:28 - 24:33)
had to cancel my plans to ohio (24:30 - 24:35)
uh but that's okay (24:33 - 24:36)
i'm sure everyone there is having a (24:35 - 24:37)
great time (24:36 - 24:40)
i will be in indianapolis for gen con (24:37 - 24:42)
so you can come and see me without these (24:40 - 24:43)
two (24:42 - 24:46)
there you go (24:43 - 24:49)
uh this is just right from joe merrick's (24:46 - 24:50)
twitter (24:49 - 24:54)
i think tone in our slack (24:50 - 24:56)
provided this there's a new merchandise (24:54 - 24:58)
line announced for pokemon center in (24:56 - 25:01)
japan based on evolution stones (24:58 - 25:04)
so there's like a little uh (25:01 - 25:06)
it looks like a little display case (25:04 - 25:08)
but it has like the water stone the leaf (25:06 - 25:13)
stone firestone sunstone moonstone (25:08 - 25:16)
thunderstone uh akash uh ice stone (25:13 - 25:19)
that's a thing right dawn stone i think (25:16 - 25:22)
dusk stone and shiny stone i think i (25:19 - 25:26)
named them all yeah good job (25:22 - 25:26)
uh so that that is that is coming and it (25:26 - 25:30)
looks like there are pokemon being (25:29 - 25:33)
featured because they they evolve via (25:30 - 25:37)
those stones so like alolan vulpix um (25:33 - 25:39)
lamp it i forget that lamp it evolves (25:37 - 25:40)
with the dust stone (25:39 - 25:45)
uh pikachu clefairy mincino and petalil (25:40 - 25:47)
uh those are all pokemon that evolve (25:45 - 25:50)
with specific stones (25:47 - 25:50)
so (25:51 - 25:52)
i (25:51 - 25:54)
don't know if that's coming to the u.s (25:52 - 25:55)
maybe (25:54 - 25:57)
i mean i hope so because i can finally (25:55 - 25:59)
get the stone i need to evolve my (25:57 - 26:01)
pokemon (25:59 - 26:03)
tired of hunting in the underground (26:01 - 26:05)

kirby developers hal laboratory and (26:29 - 26:36)
released on the nintendo 64 back in 1999 (26:32 - 26:39)
players take control of todd snap uh a (26:36 - 26:41)
photographer who's tasked with taking (26:39 - 26:43)
photos of over 60 different pokemon it's (26:41 - 26:46)
actually 63. there was supposed to be 64 (26:43 - 26:48)
because it was the nintendo 64 and then (26:46 - 26:52)
ekans stopped working so they cut it (26:48 - 26:54)
pokemon is the 64th (26:52 - 26:55)
yeah (26:54 - 26:57)
pokemon snap now that's a picture of (26:55 - 27:00)
ekins that he won't share with anybody (26:57 - 27:01)
that's (27:00 - 27:03)
that's the 64th (27:01 - 27:04)
uh (27:03 - 27:06)
pokemon snap happens to be the last game (27:04 - 27:08)
in the previous confirmed lineup for the (27:06 - 27:11)
nintendo switch's online n64 library (27:08 - 27:13)
japan will be getting custom robo and (27:11 - 27:15)
the sequel at some point (27:13 - 27:18)
nintendo has not yet revealed what else (27:15 - 27:20)
they can expect from the nintendo 64 (27:18 - 27:22)
service in the future (27:20 - 27:25)
apart from pokemon snap the most recent (27:22 - 27:28)
n64 releases were kirby 64 the crystal (27:25 - 27:30)
shards in may (27:28 - 27:33)
um pokemon snap was previously released (27:30 - 27:37)
on the wii shop back in 2007 (27:33 - 27:42)
in the wii u shop in 2016. (27:37 - 27:44)
i'm pretty sure i bought that twice i am (27:42 - 27:46)
almost positive i bought it on the wii (27:44 - 27:49)
and the wii u i bought it for one and i (27:46 - 27:52)
was like oh yeah this isn't great (27:49 - 27:54)
moving on (27:52 - 27:54)
all right (27:55 - 27:57)
it's still (27:56 - 27:59)
it's fun (27:57 - 28:01)
yeah it's it's it's it's a good game i (27:59 - 28:03)
think it holds up it's it's definitely a (28:01 - 28:06)
game that i would i would play once a (28:03 - 28:07)
year i mean you you play the whole game (28:06 - 28:11)
in in like a single a single sitting (28:07 - 28:15)
it's not it's not a very in-depth game (28:11 - 28:18)
um but is this actually convincing (28:15 - 28:21)
anyone to spend an extra 20 a year to (28:18 - 28:23)
play like a two-hour (28:21 - 28:25)
game (28:23 - 28:28)
well no one title is not enough there's (28:25 - 28:30)
several multiple titles yeah there's the (28:28 - 28:33)
animal crossing stuff (28:30 - 28:36)
but no the the nintendo 64 emulator has (28:33 - 28:38)
a bunch of titles (28:36 - 28:40)
yeah (28:38 - 28:43)
but you have to i mean it does so no if (28:40 - 28:45)
you're only interested in one title (28:43 - 28:47)
no (28:45 - 28:48)
but if you're interested in a nintendo (28:47 - 28:52)
64 emulator yes (28:48 - 28:54)
i i think that's why uh that one part of (28:52 - 28:56)
the article saying like this was the (28:54 - 28:59)
last game they talked about like what we (28:56 - 29:02)
don't know what games are coming (28:59 - 29:02)
yeah (29:04 - 29:09)
i i would like to (29:06 - 29:11)
i think for me yeah you're right will (29:09 - 29:13)
the library is not big enough for me to (29:11 - 29:15)
say here's an extra twenty dollars (29:13 - 29:17)
nintendo i would like to play (29:15 - 29:19)
these games (29:17 - 29:22)
but i also get the snez emulator and the (29:19 - 29:25)
nes emulator and the sega (29:22 - 29:26)
maybe it's just me maybe i just don't (29:25 - 29:28)
want to play old games anymore i play (29:26 - 29:30)
the heck out of them old games (29:28 - 29:32)
if you see me online playing mother you (29:30 - 29:35)
know where i'm playing it (29:32 - 29:37)
i don't know what the time to play new (29:35 - 29:40)
games more or less old games (29:37 - 29:42)
look monster hunters coming out soon (29:40 - 29:45)
will why would i no no no no no no no (29:42 - 29:48)
sir the ship has sailed you're not (29:45 - 29:50)
playing no new monster hunter you (29:48 - 29:53)
already made that declaration (29:50 - 29:56)
i'm i'm not playing sunrise (29:53 - 29:58)
starburst what's up (29:56 - 30:02)
thank you you said the ship has sailed (29:58 - 30:04)
on monster hunter (30:02 - 30:05)
i don't (30:04 - 30:07)
think the ship has sailed (30:05 - 30:10)
i think (30:07 - 30:10)
that they should not release a game a (30:11 - 30:15)
day before me leaving for germany i (30:13 - 30:16)
think that's the problem what is the (30:15 - 30:18)
name of the box monster for monster (30:16 - 30:20)
hunter sun break (30:18 - 30:23)
oh i don't know save your money you (30:20 - 30:26)
haven't cared enough (30:23 - 30:28)
pay attention to the release information (30:26 - 30:32)
to know like the key monster (30:28 - 30:32)
uh i i can't remember any of those (30:33 - 30:37)
monsters names (30:35 - 30:39)
rathalos (30:37 - 30:41)
well no the box monster is usually a new (30:39 - 30:43)
monster that's introduced for that title (30:41 - 30:45)
it's named that's a good guess though (30:43 - 30:47)
greg you can always default to rathalos (30:45 - 30:51)
for 90 of monster stuff but it's small (30:47 - 30:51)
it's based on a dracula (30:58 - 31:02)
big (31:02 - 31:07)
sense okay um we went to the tcg stuff (31:03 - 31:09)
we went through the (31:07 - 31:11)
oh uh before we take a break there was (31:09 - 31:14)
all three episodes of hissuian snow are (31:11 - 31:18)
now available on pokemon tv and youtube (31:14 - 31:20)
um i have not watched any of them i was (31:18 - 31:22)
waiting for all three to come out (31:20 - 31:24)
watched them all (31:22 - 31:25)
and the (31:24 - 31:28)
is it worth watching oh yeah it's (31:25 - 31:31)
um (31:28 - 31:31)
it's not a particularly surprising (31:33 - 31:38)
storyline but it's it's well done and (31:35 - 31:40)
the animation is beautiful (31:38 - 31:42)
i think it was bought by the attack on (31:40 - 31:44)
titan people yeah (31:42 - 31:47)
i mean it is it is beautiful to look (31:44 - 31:48)
like but like you're not going to come (31:47 - 31:52)

gift go get via internet and then it (32:15 - 32:19)

able to be downloaded i think the funny (32:19 - 32:25)
part about all of this is (32:21 - 32:29)

fast this mask a whole year the value of (32:42 - 32:49)
the item is inversely proportional to (32:46 - 32:51)
the amount of time you have to grab it (32:49 - 32:53)
to snatch it (32:51 - 32:55)
they only gave you three days for all (32:53 - 32:57)

you are forgetting that cafe remix (38:37 - 38:42)
exists (38:40 - 38:42)

remix like it and you can definitely (38:48 - 38:50)
play (38:50 - 38:51)
the majority of the game without (38:50 - 38:55)
spending any money for sure it's just (38:51 - 38:57)
if if you like costumes and you like (38:55 - 38:59)
pokemon they (38:57 - 39:00)
they are more than willing to take your (38:59 - 39:02)
money and if you don't care about any of (39:00 - 39:07)
those things then you're better off (39:02 - 39:07)
uh this is off pokemon go live ultra (39:10 - 39:16)
beasts are coming to the pokemon go fest (39:13 - 39:18)
celebrations around the world (39:16 - 39:20)
this article is like really weird not (39:18 - 39:22)
because of the information but because (39:20 - 39:25)
it seems like somebody (39:22 - 39:27)
hit like the enter key a bunch of times (39:25 - 39:29)
a lot (39:27 - 39:32)
and if you look at other articles it's (39:29 - 39:35)
not like this i blame it on the cms (39:32 - 39:37)
so it's like there was supposed to be (39:35 - 39:39)
more information that got taken away or (39:37 - 39:41)
there was supposed to be images that (39:39 - 39:43)
aren't there it's it's it's a very (39:41 - 39:46)
jarring it's like kind of hard (39:43 - 39:48)
you just look at it and you're like what (39:46 - 39:51)
happened here like why (39:48 - 39:53)
why is it one sentence and then like 18 (39:51 - 39:56)
spaces after it (39:53 - 39:58)
trainers something hidden in the code (39:56 - 40:01)
that's true maybe the ultra beasts love (39:58 - 40:01)
that (40:01 - 40:03)
the schedule for when we're going to get (40:01 - 40:04)
to go to lunch (40:03 - 40:06)
yeah uh ultra (40:04 - 40:09)
trainers ultra wormholes are forming in (40:06 - 40:10)
the sky we've noticed them appearing (40:09 - 40:13)
over berlin seattle and sapporo this (40:10 - 40:17)
could mean one more thing ultra beasts (40:13 - 40:18)
are coming (40:17 - 40:21)
uh ultra beasts are mysterious pokemon (40:18 - 40:24)
or originating from ultra space one such (40:21 - 40:26)
ultra beast nyligo has made their (40:24 - 40:30)
appearance during go fest (40:26 - 40:32)
trainers attending the following go fest (40:30 - 40:34)
can expect an encounter with ultra (40:32 - 40:36)
beasts as part of the special research (40:34 - 40:37)
in (40:36 - 40:40)
berlin that will be ferramosa in seattle (40:37 - 40:43)
that will be buzzwol and in sapporo that (40:40 - 40:45)
will be circuitry after seeing ultra (40:43 - 40:47)
beasts debut in their respective (40:45 - 40:50)
in-person uh pokemon go (40:47 - 40:51)
sorry let me start that over after these (40:50 - 40:53)
ultra beasts debut during their (40:51 - 40:56)
respective in-person pokemon go fest (40:53 - 40:58)
events they will appear globally later (40:56 - 41:01)
in the season of go (40:58 - 41:03)
still a bad name (41:01 - 41:05)
uh season of go i believe ends at the (41:03 - 41:08)
end of (41:05 - 41:09)
august (41:08 - 41:10)
so (41:09 - 41:12)
sometime between (41:10 - 41:15)
now till the end of august ideally the (41:12 - 41:16)
world should be able to catch these (41:15 - 41:17)
three (41:16 - 41:19)
because september 1st would be the new (41:17 - 41:20)
season (41:19 - 41:22)
uh the most exciting thing here is uh (41:20 - 41:25)
beast balls are coming to pokemon go (41:22 - 41:27)
uh cooperation breeds innovation after (41:25 - 41:29)
working together and to confront niall (41:27 - 41:32)
ego re there's also not not a space here (41:29 - 41:35)
this whole article this whole thing is (41:32 - 41:37)
just wild (41:35 - 41:39)
but it didn't edit it or they copied and (41:37 - 41:42)
pasted out of the wrong word processor (41:39 - 41:43)
uh (41:42 - 41:46)
re of the go ultra recon squad has (41:43 - 41:48)
created a limited number of beast balls (41:46 - 41:50)
a special kind of poke ball to help the (41:48 - 41:53)
in person go fest attendees catch ultra (41:50 - 41:55)
beasts as part of the special research (41:53 - 41:59)
during the in person go fest events (41:55 - 41:59)
i i i think (41:59 - 42:04)
i guess my speculation (42:02 - 42:06)
there's not a lot here in this article (42:04 - 42:08)
that is badly formatted (42:06 - 42:10)
is that (42:08 - 42:11)
to make (42:10 - 42:13)
the ultra be special for in-person and (42:11 - 42:15)
events you catch it in a baseball and (42:13 - 42:17)
then outside of that it will probably (42:15 - 42:18)
just be premiere ball again like night (42:17 - 42:20)
illegal (42:18 - 42:22)
so like the beast ball (42:20 - 42:25)
will be like the the special (42:22 - 42:27)
thing well then why would they advertise (42:25 - 42:29)
the beast balls are coming to pokemon (42:27 - 42:31)
yeah (42:29 - 42:34)
it says that he created a limited number (42:31 - 42:37)
of beast balls to help in person go fest (42:34 - 42:38)
attendees (42:37 - 42:40)
well then they advertise that the wrong (42:38 - 42:43)
way and i want my money back i'm (42:40 - 42:45)
suing (42:43 - 42:47)
lawsuit (42:45 - 42:47)
tickets down sale now uh (42:47 - 42:52)
tickets are limited and will be (42:51 - 42:54)
available for purchase go fest attendees (42:52 - 42:56)
may only purchase a ticket for one day (42:54 - 42:57)
of the event (42:56 - 42:59)
trainers can look forward to the go fest (42:57 - 43:02)
finale on august 20th oh this makes (42:59 - 43:03)
sense (43:02 - 43:05)
all of them all they're all going to (43:03 - 43:07)

ticket holding trainers at seattle and (44:29 - 44:34)

nine raid passes by spinning photo discs (44:48 - 44:53)
team rocket will be appearing more often (44:50 - 44:54)

mysterious components can we just get a (44:54 - 44:58)
toggle at this point to turn team rocket (44:56 - 45:00)
on and off like (44:58 - 45:03)
if there are days where like i just i i (45:00 - 45:05)
i don't plan on doing team rocket i (45:03 - 45:07)
don't want to see team rocket i don't (45:05 - 45:08)
care about their dumb balloon in the sky (45:07 - 45:10)
i don't want them standing on top of my (45:08 - 45:12)
pokemon spawns like they always do just (45:10 - 45:13)
give me like a toggle in the settings to (45:12 - 45:17)
be like you know team rocket off (45:13 - 45:19)
turn it off turn on turn it off turn it (45:17 - 45:20)
on just (45:19 - 45:21)
hide (45:20 - 45:24)
the has to be easy css right if only (45:21 - 45:27)
defeat first off no (45:24 - 45:31)
css would absolutely be the wrong thing (45:27 - 45:34)
but (45:31 - 45:36)
they're an evil team designed to get in (45:34 - 45:38)
your way if you could defeat them as (45:36 - 45:41)
easily as switching a switch off (45:38 - 45:43)
it wouldn't be much of an evil team and (45:41 - 45:45)
they're not much of an evil team as it (45:43 - 45:47)
is already and i have to think i will (45:45 - 45:50)
pay you ten dollars (45:47 - 45:53)
to add the switch to the game so i can (45:50 - 45:54)
press it (45:53 - 45:55)
well that's what's going to be the (45:54 - 45:57)
subscription right yeah if there's the (45:55 - 45:59)
subscription lets you toggle team rocket (45:57 - 46:02)

pacific time i guess yeah pacific yeah (50:39 - 50:43)

think it's pacific uh so that would be (50:43 - 50:48)
friday a saturday the same time four to (50:46 - 50:49)
six (50:48 - 50:51)

looks like are they putting me in a tent (50:56 - 51:00)
i don't know i don't know anything (50:58 - 51:02)
are they putting you in a tent yes (51:00 - 51:04)
they're putting you in a tote (51:02 - 51:06)
are they putting me in direct sunlight (51:04 - 51:08)
and say like you need to sit here for 12 (51:06 - 51:10)
two hours and only three people are (51:08 - 51:11)
going to come up and say hi (51:10 - 51:13)
probably like i don't i don't know what (51:11 - 51:15)
they're doing um (51:13 - 51:18)
i don't think the words direct sunlight (51:15 - 51:20)
in seattle are ever used in the same (51:18 - 51:21)
sentence (51:20 - 51:23)
as far as i've never been but as far as (51:21 - 51:25)
i understand the culture there that's (51:23 - 51:29)
how it operates there is sun (51:25 - 51:29)
there is sun yes (51:30 - 51:33)
um (51:34 - 51:38)
i wish i was rich (51:36 - 51:42)
yeah i would i would do a 500 day trip (51:38 - 51:44)
if i had unlimited funds (51:42 - 51:46)
there was uh i think but i think the (51:44 - 51:50)
best part about this announcement was um (51:46 - 51:51)
there (51:50 - 51:52)
there is a (51:51 - 51:54)
i don't know if you guys have heard of (51:52 - 51:56)
this person their name is fleece king (51:54 - 51:57)
they were the first person to get to (51:56 - 51:59)
level 50 in pogo (51:57 - 52:02)
um they they catch like 2 000 pokemon a (51:59 - 52:04)
day they usually catch like 10 shiny (52:02 - 52:06)
pokemon a day they're very (52:04 - 52:08)
they're very um (52:06 - 52:09)
i want to say the word aggressive but (52:08 - 52:11)
that sounds negative they're just very (52:09 - 52:14)
you know dedicated i think to the cause (52:11 - 52:15)
and (52:14 - 52:18)
they tweeted that they were upset that (52:15 - 52:20)
niantic did not pick them for this (52:18 - 52:22)
meetup (52:20 - 52:24)
and i i have two thoughts on that like (52:22 - 52:27)
as as like as somebody who makes content (52:24 - 52:30)
and somebody who uh (52:27 - 52:33)
not only has had traditional jobs but (52:30 - 52:35)
like you know around people that get (52:33 - 52:37)
opportunities that you don't (52:35 - 52:39)
as again i don't think this applies for (52:37 - 52:40)
a content creator i've i've worked in (52:39 - 52:42)
nine to five where i'm like (52:40 - 52:44)
why did these three people get picked (52:42 - 52:46)
for this thing when i am well way more (52:44 - 52:49)
qualified but why why did they not ask (52:46 - 52:50)
me but that happens a lot in content (52:49 - 52:52)
creation like why did (52:50 - 52:55)
nintendo partner with these five content (52:52 - 52:57)
creators why didn't they think of me (52:55 - 52:59)
i i don't think the pick me energy is (52:57 - 53:02)
ever good to put out there that's my (52:59 - 53:05)
personal belief of like i get passed up (53:02 - 53:06)
for opportunities all the time i don't (53:05 - 53:08)
think tweeting about it is is the right (53:06 - 53:10)
thing but they decided like hey they (53:08 - 53:12)
were upset that nights even picked them (53:10 - 53:13)
that's not the point of the story the (53:12 - 53:15)
point of the story is somebody (53:13 - 53:18)
tweeted to fleece king and said i know (53:15 - 53:22)
everyone on this list except for that (53:18 - 53:24)
steve guy (53:22 - 53:27)
and i was like ah what do you mean (53:24 - 53:29)
correct come on there are another there (53:27 - 53:31)
are other pokemon podcasts on this list (53:29 - 53:32)
like (53:31 - 53:34)
what do you mean you've never heard of (53:32 - 53:36)
me (53:34 - 53:36)
so that was really funny to me that like (53:36 - 53:39)
somebody was like i've heard of all (53:38 - 53:41)
these people except for that one steve (53:39 - 53:44)
guy (53:41 - 53:44)
i beat you a fair you're not a ghost (53:44 - 53:49)
specific person (53:47 - 53:51)
yeah that's true the the other two (53:49 - 53:53)
podcasts that niantica picked are (53:51 - 53:55)
specific (53:53 - 53:57)
go podcast from from like start to (53:55 - 53:59)
finish i think i've been on both of (53:57 - 54:01)
their shows in this tweet now cause this (53:59 - 54:03)
is hilarious i i should have i should (54:01 - 54:05)
have favorited it i tweeted at them and (54:03 - 54:09)
i said hello i'm the steve guys (54:05 - 54:09)
yeah but yeah where i'm like (54:13 - 54:17)
i think (54:16 - 54:21)
almost every content creator here is (54:17 - 54:24)
specifically a go content creator and (54:21 - 54:26)
you know we talk about go a lot you know (54:24 - 54:28)
a lot sometimes whole segments of our (54:26 - 54:30)
episodes are dedicated (54:28 - 54:31)
to go (54:30 - 54:33)
um (54:31 - 54:34)
and we we've all been playing ghost (54:33 - 54:36)
since day one (54:34 - 54:37)
uh (54:36 - 54:39)
we all we all are above that level 40. i (54:37 - 54:41)
think we've all hit every single (54:39 - 54:43)
community i i play pokemon go every day (54:41 - 54:46)
i know greg has their complaints with go (54:43 - 54:48)
um (54:46 - 54:51)
but uh yeah you know we we are not a go (54:48 - 54:54)
specific podcast we cover all pokemon (54:51 - 54:56)
news you know when i stream on twitch i (54:54 - 54:57)
don't specifically stream go i don't (54:56 - 54:59)
specifically stream tcg i don't (54:57 - 55:01)
specifically stream shiny hunting like i (54:59 - 55:05)
do i try to do everything so i think (55:01 - 55:07)
that's always kind of what (55:05 - 55:10)
we started as and (55:07 - 55:12)
as as pokemon has gotten bigger and (55:10 - 55:15)
bigger you know people try to niche down (55:12 - 55:18)
um and for me you know i i felt i had a (55:15 - 55:21)
very big competitive hole in my (55:18 - 55:22)
knowledge (55:21 - 55:25)
so that's why i got a personal coach to (55:22 - 55:27)
get better at like the battling aspect (55:25 - 55:30)
so i could feel fill that niche as well (55:27 - 55:34)
did you find the tweet i found it (55:30 - 55:36)
[Music] (55:34 - 55:38)
i know everyone here except for the (55:36 - 55:41)
steve fella which is like a perfect (55:38 - 55:42)
sentence (55:41 - 55:45)
[Laughter] (55:42 - 55:48)

but (56:29 - 56:33)
yeah the plan when i get to germany is (56:31 - 56:35)
to stream that experience i have the (56:33 - 56:37)
stream backpack (56:35 - 56:39)
it's supposed to be eight hours (56:37 - 56:42)
friday saturday sunday (56:39 - 56:45)
i'm still trying to work with company (56:42 - 56:48)
a company to get a hot spot there or try (56:45 - 56:49)
to figure out (56:48 - 56:52)
how i can get data (56:49 - 56:54)
good enough data to (56:52 - 56:57)
to upload to twitch and so you guys can (56:54 - 56:59)
watch so um (56:57 - 57:01)
i think everything's gonna work out we (56:59 - 57:03)
still got a week before that trip so (57:01 - 57:06)
i'm excited and nervous but (57:03 - 57:06)
uh still plenty of time to (57:07 - 57:12)
book your overpriced ticket to it's i (57:09 - 57:14)
look it's not niantic's fault it's (57:12 - 57:16)
whatever domestic airfare in the united (57:14 - 57:18)
states right now is is pretty ridiculous (57:16 - 57:20)
when i tried to go to indiana it was (57:18 - 57:22)
like 700 when i tried to go to ohio it (57:20 - 57:24)
was 700 (57:22 - 57:26)
i think my ticket to seattle that (57:24 - 57:28)
niantic paid for was like eight hundred (57:26 - 57:31)
dollars like it is it is really hot and (57:28 - 57:33)
and my germany ticket was a thousand (57:31 - 57:35)
dollars like (57:33 - 57:40)
it's really hard to find good (57:35 - 57:40)
not a good slash cheap slash affordable (57:41 - 57:44)
uh (57:43 - 57:46)
airfare right now i don't i don't know (57:44 - 57:49)
why (57:46 - 57:50)
uh final bit of pokemon go news this is (57:49 - 57:53)
off nianticlabs.com an update on (57:50 - 57:56)
niantic's gameplay policy enforcement we (57:53 - 57:57)
want to start off this note by saying (57:56 - 57:58)
thank you (57:57 - 58:00)
to our players for your patience and (57:58 - 58:02)
understanding as we continue to work to (58:00 - 58:04)
facilitate a fun and fair environment (58:02 - 58:06)
for everyone we've heard your feedback (58:04 - 58:08)
and feel your frustration on how (58:06 - 58:10)
cheating behaviors negatively impact (58:08 - 58:12)
your gameplay experience (58:10 - 58:13)
it has been a little while since our (58:12 - 58:15)
most recent update from the beginning of (58:13 - 58:18)
2021 on our efforts to prevent cheating (58:15 - 58:19)
in our games and we wanted to share what (58:18 - 58:21)
we've been working on (58:19 - 58:23)
our last post was focused primarily on (58:21 - 58:25)
sharing a broad overview of the actions (58:23 - 58:27)
we have taken to punish accounts we (58:25 - 58:29)
found to be cheating in multiple niantic (58:27 - 58:31)
games since then we've invested in (58:29 - 58:33)
becoming a better but we've been (58:31 - 58:36)
invested in becoming better at observing (58:33 - 58:38)
cheating behavior and we can no more (58:36 - 58:40)
reliably pinpoint these activities with (58:38 - 58:43)
higher speed and accuracy preventing (58:40 - 58:45)
legitimate players from being punished (58:43 - 58:46)
incorrectly (58:45 - 58:48)
as a result we will be ramping up our (58:46 - 58:50)
enforcement against these behaviors (58:48 - 58:52)
across all our games rolling out an (58:50 - 58:55)
improvement for an anti-cheat (58:52 - 58:57)
we are starting now by taking action (58:55 - 58:58)
against a number of accounts we found in (58:57 - 59:00)
violations with our terms of service or (58:58 - 59:02)
player guidelines during a recent (59:00 - 59:04)
in-game events in pogo they probably (59:02 - 59:06)
mean go fest (59:04 - 59:07)
this is only the first step in (59:06 - 59:09)
implementing our improved cheating (59:07 - 59:11)
behavior detection and enforcement (59:09 - 59:12)
systems these improvements will be (59:11 - 59:14)
integrated into all niantic games to (59:12 - 59:16)
detect and punish players on a (59:14 - 59:18)
consistent and ongoing basis rather than (59:16 - 59:21)
in waves as we had in the past (59:18 - 59:23)
looking ahead we continue to improve our (59:21 - 59:25)
methods and process to ensure we are (59:23 - 59:26)
staying ahead of any new behaviors that (59:25 - 59:29)
allow players to unfairly exploit game (59:26 - 59:31)
rules (59:29 - 59:32)
please note only official versions of (59:31 - 59:34)
the game are available in the google (59:32 - 59:36)
play store apple app store and some (59:34 - 59:38)
samsung galaxy store note we do not (59:36 - 59:41)
support jailbroken or rooted devices or (59:38 - 59:43)
third-party apps if you aren't sure (59:41 - 59:45)
about which behaviors are acceptable (59:43 - 59:47)
please refer to our player guidelines (59:45 - 59:49)
the niantic team (59:47 - 59:50)
obviously they aren't going to say how (59:49 - 59:51)
they're going to find cheaters because (59:50 - 59:53)
then people will be like okay let's just (59:51 - 59:55)
not do that (59:53 - 59:55)
correct i cannot give the details (59:56 - 60:01)
um i haven't heard of any (60:01 - 60:04)
bands going out (60:05 - 60:09)
um but they did say they're not doing (60:07 - 60:11)
this in waves anymore (60:09 - 60:13)
um (60:11 - 60:15)
i i don't know what they're looking for (60:13 - 60:16)
right like (60:15 - 60:17)
you know there was that situation where (60:16 - 60:19)
they released (60:17 - 60:21)
mesprit (60:19 - 60:24)
uh as elf and ooxy (60:21 - 60:26)
in in the wild before they were in raids (60:24 - 60:27)
and pogo and there were people that were (60:26 - 60:30)
like i got all three within like the (60:27 - 60:31)
first hour (60:30 - 60:33)
and it's like those are the cheaters (60:31 - 60:36)
like kids and pot it would be impossible (60:33 - 60:39)
to get those three um (60:36 - 60:41)
but they didn't get banned right like i (60:39 - 60:43)
don't (60:41 - 60:45)
know what niantic is specifically (60:43 - 60:47)
looking for obviously if somebody's (60:45 - 60:48)
streaming on twitch and they're (60:47 - 60:51)
obviously streaming themselves you know (60:48 - 60:53)
we know that they didn't get caught in a (60:51 - 60:54)
later band like (60:53 - 60:56)
yeah yeah that's that's true (60:54 - 60:59)
but so the hard thing is (60:56 - 61:01)
like i mean there's two worlds out there (60:59 - 61:02)
right (61:01 - 61:04)
if your toxic work environment will (61:02 - 61:07)
anderson and somebody goes on social (61:04 - 61:09)
media and says i caught all three you (61:07 - 61:10)
ban them (61:09 - 61:12)
you figure out who they are and you (61:10 - 61:14)
banned them you immediately banned them (61:12 - 61:17)
if you're softer gentler (61:14 - 61:19)
world of 2022 which i can't believe i (61:17 - 61:21)
have to (61:19 - 61:25)
live in the same universe as (61:21 - 61:26)
you say (61:25 - 61:29)
well maybe they're fibbing and they're (61:26 - 61:32)
just they used photoshop to make it look (61:29 - 61:35)
like they had all three so we can't (61:32 - 61:39)
really ban them because that's not proof (61:35 - 61:41)
no no no no this is that's not the world (61:39 - 61:44)
i want to live in ban everybody (61:41 - 61:46)
much like i do with my twitter (61:44 - 61:49)
[Laughter] (61:46 - 61:49)
account yeah i mean like (61:51 - 61:57)
there there are people who play with (61:55 - 61:59)
two three four devices and that's (61:57 - 62:02)
technically against the terms of service (61:59 - 62:03)
i (62:02 - 62:05)
you know i look (62:03 - 62:08)
me personally i already give pogo enough (62:05 - 62:09)
money (62:08 - 62:11)
one device is more than enough (62:09 - 62:13)
could i get more chinese with two (62:11 - 62:16)
devices sure could i get (62:13 - 62:18)
you know better shiny luck by having two (62:16 - 62:21)
devices out sure but i know what will (62:18 - 62:22)
happen (62:21 - 62:24)
what will happen is like (62:22 - 62:27)
oh you know i i (62:24 - 62:29)
i'm not this is my free account i'm not (62:27 - 62:31)
giving any money and then all of a (62:29 - 62:33)
sudden a go fest comes up or all of a (62:31 - 62:35)
sudden you know a paid event comes up (62:33 - 62:37)
and that's like well (62:35 - 62:39)
i could no no no (62:37 - 62:41)
one account for me (62:39 - 62:43)
the only person that's winning in (62:41 - 62:46)
multiple device situations (62:43 - 62:47)
is niantic they're get they're (62:46 - 62:49)
eventually going you're eventually going (62:47 - 62:50)
to break that steal on that second (62:49 - 62:52)
account or that third account and you're (62:50 - 62:55)
gonna start giving that account money (62:52 - 62:57)
and i don't think that's what niantic is (62:55 - 62:59)
looking for one because they're getting (62:57 - 63:01)
money from those people (62:59 - 63:02)
but two it's really not (63:01 - 63:04)
that big of a deal i think what they're (63:02 - 63:07)
looking for are these people that are (63:04 - 63:08)
are (63:07 - 63:10)
jumping around the country (63:08 - 63:13)
um getting perfect ivs getting per not (63:10 - 63:16)
perfect but like the correct ivs for go (63:13 - 63:20)
battle league or or (63:16 - 63:20)
um abusing the systems in in whatever (63:20 - 63:25)
way that gives the there is (63:22 - 63:28)
there is that unfair advantage in gbl if (63:25 - 63:31)
you have the ability to jump around (63:28 - 63:33)
specifically with ways to get candy for (63:31 - 63:35)
that or (63:33 - 63:38)
ways to um (63:35 - 63:41)
get specific pokemon you're looking for (63:38 - 63:42)
uh (63:41 - 63:45)
i think if it was just if i think if gbl (63:42 - 63:46)
didn't exist it probably wouldn't be (63:45 - 63:48)
that big of a deal because like (63:46 - 63:50)
you know you go to the park and somebody (63:48 - 63:52)
says they have like 2 000 chinese and (63:50 - 63:54)
you only have like five it's like is (63:52 - 63:55)
that really affecting your game (63:54 - 63:58)
experience no it's just that's the (63:55 - 64:00)
that's their dedication that they they (63:58 - 64:01)
they put in (64:00 - 64:02)
um (64:01 - 64:04)
but yeah i guess (64:02 - 64:07)
i guess we'll see how this (64:04 - 64:10)
works i suppose the easiest way that (64:07 - 64:12)
they are like a baseline of a way that (64:10 - 64:14)
they can be looking for spoofers is they (64:12 - 64:15)
compare (64:14 - 64:16)
the (64:15 - 64:20)
gps of where a pokemon spawned so if (64:16 - 64:21)
they include that in some of the pokemon (64:20 - 64:23)
data somehow (64:21 - 64:25)
and (64:23 - 64:28)
the where your ip address is coming from (64:25 - 64:29)
since that is somewhat location (64:28 - 64:32)
dependent and say wait a minute (64:29 - 64:34)
this ip address (64:32 - 64:37)
couldn't have existed at this location (64:34 - 64:39)
simultaneously so clearly (64:37 - 64:43)
that's a gps spoofer (64:39 - 64:43)
just take the game down ban them all (64:49 - 64:56)
yes (64:53 - 64:56)
20 minutes of free time back in my day (65:00 - 65:04)
just shut the entire game down yep (65:05 - 65:10)
uh i think that's i think that's all the (65:10 - 65:15)
the news we have this week um (65:13 - 65:18)
so yeah let's let's jump to (65:15 - 65:22)
question of the week (65:18 - 65:22)
question of the week (65:23 - 65:28)
it's time to let you know it's that time (65:25 - 65:31)
in the show (65:28 - 65:31)
now just got it in right under the wire (65:31 - 65:38)
before june's over hey (65:34 - 65:41)
i know my timing janine and i are great (65:38 - 65:43)
at calendar (65:41 - 65:43)
this is from our slack this is from (65:43 - 65:47)
brandon what is your favorite and least (65:45 - 65:50)
favorite mechanic in any video game any (65:47 - 65:54)
not specifically pokemon any video game (65:50 - 65:54)
can i say crafting crafting kind of (65:57 - 66:01)
sucks (65:59 - 66:03)
um you can say anything you want sir you (66:01 - 66:05)
may be wrong but you can say anything (66:03 - 66:08)
you want (66:05 - 66:08)
i want to say crafting (66:12 - 66:18)
as your least favorite or favorite (66:15 - 66:20)
like least like i (66:18 - 66:23)
even in like legends arceus like yeah (66:20 - 66:24)
you can go around and collect all the (66:23 - 66:28)
ore and the rocks and the red orange (66:24 - 66:31)
just let me buy the (66:28 - 66:33)
pokeballs mean you can't just buy the (66:31 - 66:36)
pokeballs yeah but like like like i have (66:33 - 66:38)
all the stuff and then you you go to the (66:36 - 66:41)
seller in legends and they'll sell you (66:38 - 66:43)
the stuff that you can pick up and it's (66:41 - 66:46)
cheaper to buy the two items and then (66:43 - 66:47)
craft the pokeball than just buying the (66:46 - 66:49)
pokeball but like (66:47 - 66:52)
i have the money just to buy the stuff (66:49 - 66:54)
you're just giving me like two i have to (66:52 - 66:56)
buy two things and then i have to go out (66:54 - 66:57)
and then i have to go to the crafting (66:56 - 66:59)
thing and then i gotta crank the slider (66:57 - 67:02)
but you don't have to (66:59 - 67:05)
and the only pay the higher price (67:02 - 67:08)
[Laughter] (67:05 - 67:10)
they're like (67:08 - 67:12)
you don't like crafting (67:10 - 67:15)
for five dollars more you don't have to (67:12 - 67:16)
craft (67:15 - 67:18)
and steve is still like i don't like (67:16 - 67:22)
this mechanic this is bad (67:18 - 67:22)
but i (67:22 - 67:26)
wanna optimize my money (67:23 - 67:29)
uh i wanna say my least favorite in (67:26 - 67:32)
general are things like talent trees (67:29 - 67:34)
because there's always (67:32 - 67:37)
an optimal path (67:34 - 67:39)
most talent trees are like here's the (67:37 - 67:40)
good one and then we had to have two (67:39 - 67:43)
other options and they're both garbage (67:40 - 67:45)
um that's a good one that's a good one (67:43 - 67:47)
can i change my answer (67:45 - 67:50)
you no you locked in (67:47 - 67:50)
final answer happened a while ago (67:52 - 67:56)
what do i always enjoy i mean i always (67:57 - 68:02)
like (67:59 - 68:02)
i mean the catching mechanic in pokemon (68:02 - 68:06)
is the thing that i always go to and if (68:04 - 68:10)
any game has it i always use it (68:06 - 68:10)
i think my favorite is just collecting i (68:10 - 68:13)
like a game that i can collect but i (68:12 - 68:17)
want to be rewarded for collecting (68:13 - 68:20)
like it like the the pokedex and legends (68:17 - 68:22)
you you do get arceus for collecting (68:20 - 68:24)
them all but if you want to like perfect (68:22 - 68:26)
the pokedex (68:24 - 68:27)
and (68:26 - 68:30)
perfect all 243 pokemon or however many (68:27 - 68:31)
are in that game you don't get anything (68:30 - 68:32)
for it (68:31 - 68:34)
there's no there's no reward for (68:32 - 68:37)
perfecting (68:34 - 68:37)
i would have to say that my favorite (68:38 - 68:44)
mechanic in any video game (68:41 - 68:45)
is (68:44 - 68:46)
rolling (68:45 - 68:50)
i love a smooth continuous uninterrupted (68:46 - 68:54)
roll heck yeah get uh just days hours i (68:50 - 68:57)
will spend a half spent (68:54 - 68:58)
love it (68:57 - 68:59)
will spend (68:58 - 69:01)
it's true true because my days of (68:59 - 69:03)
rolling have not ended (69:01 - 69:04)
uh (69:03 - 69:06)
so i would say my least favorite (69:04 - 69:08)
mechanic is actually a non-mechanic in a (69:06 - 69:10)
way but it's when (69:08 - 69:13)
a game is open world and there's no (69:10 - 69:14)
gating (69:13 - 69:18)
to keep you out of places that you can't (69:14 - 69:20)
survive (69:18 - 69:23)
and it's like you go into that place any (69:20 - 69:25)
creature there immediately kills you and (69:23 - 69:27)
the auto save doesn't take you back out (69:25 - 69:30)
of that place like oh yeah you restore (69:27 - 69:32)
and you're still in that area and it's (69:30 - 69:34)
like well now i'm just really really (69:32 - 69:38)
trapped in the world of misery (69:34 - 69:38)
fallout 4 i'm calling your name (69:38 - 69:43)
that was my experience with fallout 3. (69:41 - 69:45)
fallout 3 i had an experience where i (69:43 - 69:46)
the game (69:45 - 69:48)
i was stuck in a canyon like i couldn't (69:46 - 69:50)
climb the walls so i could either go (69:48 - 69:53)
north or south and north had those like (69:50 - 69:55)
deathclaw things (69:53 - 69:57)
and they would like one-shot you but if (69:55 - 70:00)
i went south the game would crash (69:57 - 70:02)
oh good design (70:00 - 70:05)
that's most bethesda games is like (70:02 - 70:08)
my my most hated i was gonna say it (70:05 - 70:10)
can't be a bug but it's like my most (70:08 - 70:13)
hated game mechanic was uh when i played (70:10 - 70:15)
final fantasy (70:13 - 70:18)
x and (70:15 - 70:21)
got about halfway through the game (70:18 - 70:24)
and my save file corrupted and like (70:21 - 70:26)
there was nothing i could do (70:24 - 70:28)
yeah i would have to restart the game (70:26 - 70:30)
and i was like i'm not going to restart (70:28 - 70:32)
this game the whole swimming blitz ball (70:30 - 70:34)
thing or whatever i hate this i don't (70:32 - 70:36)
ever want to do it again (70:34 - 70:37)
and (70:36 - 70:39)
no i (70:37 - 70:42)
love blitz ball so much (70:39 - 70:44)
and brent would play the game and when (70:42 - 70:46)
they got to the bliss ball parts he (70:44 - 70:48)
would hand the controller over to me and (70:46 - 70:50)
then i would just do all the blitzball (70:48 - 70:52)
parts because i enjoyed the heck out of (70:50 - 70:57)
blitzball i don't know why i just did (70:52 - 70:57)
uh (70:59 - 71:02)
the one thing actually i changed my mind (71:00 - 71:04)
on the thing i dislike (71:02 - 71:05)
uh this is this (71:04 - 71:08)
this was this is a thing in like i know (71:05 - 71:10)
that this was a complaint for sword and (71:08 - 71:11)
shield where people were like the game (71:10 - 71:14)
is very linear (71:11 - 71:15)
um (71:14 - 71:18)
but i i like that in video games because (71:15 - 71:20)
i think of when i was playing elden ring (71:18 - 71:22)
and you go into one of those caves and (71:20 - 71:25)
it breaks off into two parts (71:22 - 71:27)
and you know one part takes you to the (71:25 - 71:28)
end and the other part is just a dead (71:27 - 71:31)
end and it's usually nothing over there (71:28 - 71:33)
and it's like yeah it's not linear but (71:31 - 71:36)
like i hate the choice of like do i go (71:33 - 71:37)
left or right (71:36 - 71:41)
left is like the dead end area but right (71:37 - 71:42)
is where i need to go but if i go right (71:41 - 71:44)
right away (71:42 - 71:45)
what am i missing in the left and (71:44 - 71:48)
there's nothing ever good in the left (71:45 - 71:50)
and according to you (71:48 - 71:53)
no in elden ring you you spend eight (71:50 - 71:55)
hours in a cave to get a wand that you (71:53 - 71:57)
can't even use because you're an axe (71:55 - 71:59)
user uh like (71:57 - 72:02)
like i would rather just called juan to (71:59 - 72:04)
cave so i don't know why you wouldn't (72:02 - 72:07)
have you ever heard the expression of (72:04 - 72:10)
it's not the destination it's what (72:07 - 72:13)
you've enjoyed along the way (72:10 - 72:16)
no i don't want it i don't enjoy (72:13 - 72:18)
the i don't enjoy the stress of needing (72:16 - 72:21)
to know if i need to go left or right i (72:18 - 72:23)
just wanna i'm here now i wanna get (72:21 - 72:25)
through the whole cave i wanna make sure (72:23 - 72:28)
i didn't miss anything okay (72:25 - 72:31)
gobbler useless one to the right (72:28 - 72:33)
yeah at least tell me the useless one (72:31 - 72:35)
somebody i don't know i would rather a (72:33 - 72:37)
sweatshirt for this man that just says (72:35 - 72:40)
game gobbler it says i'm not interested (72:37 - 72:44)
in your story just get me to the end (72:40 - 72:47)
i just i just (72:44 - 72:47)
i don't want the choices i don't want (72:48 - 72:53)
the stress give me hey hey tpci all that (72:50 - 72:55)
money you've been spending on world (72:53 - 72:56)

apricorn balls before they give me a (73:42 - 73:47)
luxury ball (73:44 - 73:47)

items what item i would i mean they just (73:51 - 73:55)
did all the stones and i'm into that you (73:53 - 73:57)
know they haven't done (73:55 - 73:59)
like a really (73:57 - 74:02)
good pokedex (73:59 - 74:04)
i don't really care which one but like (74:02 - 74:06)
they do like the tiger electronic like (74:04 - 74:08)
plastic ones with like the (74:06 - 74:11)
the calculator screen (74:08 - 74:13)
and like the five sound effects that it (74:11 - 74:15)
does (74:13 - 74:17)
but they haven't done like a high (74:15 - 74:19)
quality (74:17 - 74:20)
pokedex anything (74:19 - 74:22)
i don't know what it would be like i (74:20 - 74:23)
don't know if it needs to be functional (74:22 - 74:25)
or not functional i don't like i know (74:23 - 74:28)
they have like again like etsy probably (74:25 - 74:30)
has like plastic (74:28 - 74:33)
iphone cases where you it looks (74:30 - 74:35)
but like something official like (74:33 - 74:37)
something high quality official i think (74:35 - 74:40)
that would be that would be cool (74:37 - 74:40)
i want a z crystal bracelet or a mega (74:40 - 74:47)
stone holder that's actual jewelry (74:44 - 74:49)

i want a tmcd case and the tms all play (74:53 - 74:59)
a single that's related to the tm that (74:56 - 75:01)
it's supposed to be and then it (74:59 - 75:03)
self-destructs after one time you use it (75:01 - 75:06)
you play it once and the (75:03 - 75:09)
disc frosts over and you never replayed (75:06 - 75:12)
again (75:09 - 75:12)
yeah i think the mega stone would be (75:13 - 75:16)
good still like mega stones would be (75:14 - 75:18)
really cool like high quality mega (75:16 - 75:20)
stones um (75:18 - 75:24)

would referring back to the steve's (76:56 - 77:00)
statement of we have to refer to (76:58 - 77:02)
yu-gi-oh at least once per episode and (77:00 - 77:04)

refer to yu-gi-oh once until we got to (77:04 - 77:10)
pokemon of the week and i literally said (77:07 - 77:12)

all right there's what (77:56 - 78:00)
do we have about a pistol (77:58 - 78:02)
trivia (78:00 - 78:04)
let's look it up (78:02 - 78:06)
there's nothing trust me (78:04 - 78:08)
i've been there i'll give you this (78:06 - 78:11)
week's pokemon here we go (78:08 - 78:14)
while growing berries in kalos it is (78:11 - 78:17)
possible for six pokemon to be found in (78:14 - 78:20)
your fully grown berry trees rustling (78:17 - 78:22)
the tree (78:20 - 78:24)
of these (78:22 - 78:28)
only one has a single evolution that is (78:24 - 78:31)
not influenced by or dependent upon the (78:28 - 78:35)
pokemon's gender (78:31 - 78:35)
and just to make it clear because people (78:36 - 78:39)
get a little confused by single (78:38 - 78:41)
evolution i mean it it can only evolve (78:39 - 78:44)
once it's not going to evolve twice you (78:41 - 78:46)
know (78:44 - 78:47)
it's not going to evolve and then evolve (78:46 - 78:51)
again it only evolves once (78:47 - 78:51)
uh (78:56 - 78:58)
some breaking news here at the north (78:59 - 79:03)
america international championships (79:01 - 79:06)
somebody brought uh a deck consisting of (79:03 - 79:08)
the oversized cards (79:06 - 79:10)
uh (79:08 - 79:12)
all of them all (79:10 - 79:15)
all 60 cards were oversized (79:12 - 79:17)
uh here here's the size difference how (79:15 - 79:20)
can you get oversized energies (79:17 - 79:22)
they had no energies so the deck was (79:20 - 79:24)
pretty much unplayable they just had 60 (79:22 - 79:28)
oversized cards (79:24 - 79:28)
i (79:28 - 79:31)
this these are the kind of people that i (79:29 - 79:33)
choose not to associate with that is the (79:31 - 79:36)
nicest way of me staying that statement (79:33 - 79:37)
they (79:36 - 79:39)
uh (79:37 - 79:39)
they said they lost game one (79:40 - 79:46)
uh the opponent scooped on game two to (79:42 - 79:50)
force a game three (79:46 - 79:50)
and then the deck proceeded to get (79:50 - 79:54)
checked (79:52 - 79:57)
uh they then said their judge returned (79:54 - 79:59)
and said we're not sure if this is (79:57 - 80:01)
playable but finish the round and talk (79:59 - 80:05)
to us afterwards (80:01 - 80:05)
that (80:06 - 80:08)
that's going to ruin the winning (80:07 - 80:11)
player's elo because your best out of (80:08 - 80:15)
three counts towards your elo (80:11 - 80:17)
um talked with the judging staff (80:15 - 80:19)
afterwards if i didn't drop i might have (80:17 - 80:22)
received a dq for marked cards the (80:19 - 80:25)
oversized cards aren't cut as high as a (80:22 - 80:28)
standard card some cards could easily be (80:25 - 80:31)
identified (80:28 - 80:33)
were they not sleeved (80:31 - 80:36)
no which i actually think is a rule (80:33 - 80:37)
yeah (80:36 - 80:40)
i think that is a rule that you need to (80:37 - 80:43)
have a sleeved deck to participate (80:40 - 80:46)
um (80:43 - 80:46)
uh there there's no way they don't (80:46 - 80:50)
update the rules now but that's that's (80:49 - 80:52)
the thing is like there's going they're (80:50 - 80:53)
going to update the rules to say that (80:52 - 80:56)
these oversized cards are not allowed um (80:53 - 80:57)
there's nothing in the rules that says (80:56 - 81:01)
you can't use them (80:57 - 81:01)
uh anyways uh thanks for listening (81:02 - 81:06)
thanks for making it to the end of the (81:04 - 81:06)
show (81:06 - 81:08)
