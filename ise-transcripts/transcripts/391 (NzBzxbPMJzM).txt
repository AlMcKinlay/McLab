[Music] (0:01 - 0:34)
what's up everyone welcome to the 390 (0:29 - 0:36)
first episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:34 - 0:39)
it's super effective I am your host s BJ (0:36 - 0:44)
with me is will it is now what the (0:39 - 0:47)
second weekend in January if you are (0:44 - 0:49)
planning on giving up on the gym that (0:47 - 0:51)
now's the time to do it friends it's (0:49 - 0:54)
time to give up and please make room for (0:51 - 0:58)
will again that's my anti clanging and (0:54 - 1:02)
banging I mean it's bad but Gregg also (0:58 - 1:04)
here also probably complaining about (1:02 - 1:08)
people at the gym well okay there's but (1:04 - 1:12)
this is like a two-fold problem this one (1:08 - 1:13)
people who actually want to make a (1:12 - 1:16)
change like who would probably enjoy the (1:13 - 1:19)
gym pick this time of year when it's (1:16 - 1:22)
just full of people and nobody knows (1:19 - 1:24)
what they're doing and so you're getting (1:22 - 1:26)
this false perspective of a super super (1:24 - 1:28)
JIT busy gym when in March there's like (1:26 - 1:30)
five of us there and that's the time to (1:28 - 1:32)
join the gym because you could actually (1:30 - 1:34)
get staff to help you to have room in (1:32 - 1:37)
the locker room right now it's just a (1:34 - 1:39)
mess of people and a lot of them are (1:37 - 1:41)
just standing around because they don't (1:39 - 1:43)
know what to do and there's not enough (1:41 - 1:44)
staff to help them (1:43 - 1:47)
it's an openness a mess of people who (1:44 - 1:50)
don't understand basic gym courtesy such (1:47 - 1:52)
as if someone is standing next to a (1:50 - 1:54)
piece of equipment facing the piece of (1:52 - 1:57)
equipment most likely they're planning (1:54 - 1:58)
on using that piece of equipment don't (1:57 - 2:01)
just go and sit on it right in front of (1:58 - 2:03)
them without even asking hey were you (2:01 - 2:09)
gonna use this oh oh I got so mad let me (2:03 - 2:12)
tell you about adventure I know I could (2:09 - 2:14)
tie that home you could you could you (2:12 - 2:18)
could you won't but you could it's even (2:14 - 2:19)
supported by Apple watch this is like (2:18 - 2:22)
makes it even better get out that Pilate (2:19 - 2:25)
son well speaking of Pilates there was a (2:22 - 2:29)
Pokemon announcement there was what I (2:25 - 2:30)
don't I don't think there was any (2:29 - 2:33)
Pilates in it though but they both start (2:30 - 2:34)
with peas so that was my transition oh (2:33 - 2:38)
is this about trade evolutions yes wait (2:34 - 2:40)
we have a Hugh (2:38 - 2:42)
good show for ya guys we're gonna get (2:40 - 2:44)
right into it actually there's some (2:42 - 2:45)
Pokemon got no news and some other news (2:44 - 2:47)
but we're actually gonna just start off (2:45 - 2:49)
with the good stuff here and (2:47 - 2:50)
[Music] (2:49 - 2:53)
build-a-bear is brick no kidding there's (2:50 - 2:55)
no build the band isn't didn't we (2:53 - 2:57)
discover that build-a-bear if you (2:55 - 2:58)
brought your Eevee in they'd rip it (2:57 - 3:00)
apart and make it into a new one I've (2:58 - 3:01)
heard that rumor (3:00 - 3:04)
yes well stuffing Andry stuff a new one (3:01 - 3:13)
with it yeah there was a Pokemon direct (3:04 - 3:17)
on january 9th and it was 20 minutes (3:13 - 3:20)
long which is one of the longest pokemon (3:17 - 3:21)
Durex ever if not the longest i think i (3:20 - 3:23)
think it was 20 minutes and 26 seconds (3:21 - 3:25)
if you were counting and i think the (3:23 - 3:27)
longest one prior to that was like 19 (3:25 - 3:30)
minutes and 26 seconds which i think was (3:27 - 3:33)
the one right before X&Y came out so (3:30 - 3:35)
there was a lot of assumptions that this (3:33 - 3:38)
was going to be in regards to Pokemon (3:35 - 3:40)
home and Pokemon sleep and ideally (3:38 - 3:42)
detective Pikachu for the switch which I (3:40 - 3:44)
think a lot of people have forgot about (3:42 - 3:46)
that that's still in development and it (3:44 - 3:48)
was not that there was also a side of (3:46 - 3:50)
people that thought that this was maybe (3:48 - 3:53)
going to be the 2020 fall game whether (3:50 - 3:57)
that was a Gen 4 remake or a Gen 2 (3:53 - 4:01)
remake an ultimate Pokemon MMO that had (3:57 - 4:04)
every verb whatever your fantasies were (4:01 - 4:08)
that was dubbed probably highly unlikely (4:04 - 4:11)
since the fastest we've ever gotten a (4:08 - 4:13)
Pokemon game after announcement after (4:11 - 4:16)
another Pokemon game was when they (4:13 - 4:16)
announced (4:16 - 4:19)
let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee what (4:16 - 4:21)
we know now know his sword and shield (4:19 - 4:25)
which is five months after Ultra Sun (4:21 - 4:28)
ultra moon as of this recording sword (4:25 - 4:30)
and shield Believe It or Not not even (4:28 - 4:34)
two months old but I guess logistically (4:30 - 4:36)
it would be really weird for them to say (4:34 - 4:40)
like hey we spent all this work in a (4:36 - 4:43)
brand new generation of Pokemon with a (4:40 - 4:45)
brand new anime that isn't even out yet (4:43 - 4:47)
and a brand new trading card game format (4:45 - 4:50)
that isn't even out yet to announce (4:47 - 4:54)
another video game they did not do that (4:50 - 4:57)
but they did something which I guess (4:54 - 4:58)
people have opinions on but this was (4:57 - 5:00)
emailed to me this is the press release (4:58 - 5:02)
that they sent out obviously it's kind (5:00 - 5:04)
of hard to cover 20 minute video so (5:02 - 5:06)
we're gonna read what they broked (5:04 - 5:10)
Pokemon Sword expansion pass in Pokemon (5:06 - 5:14)
shield expansion patch hats not patch to (5:10 - 5:17)
launch 2020 with two sets of additional (5:14 - 5:20)
content and then in subtext pokemon (5:17 - 5:22)
mystery dungeon rescue team DX for a (5:20 - 5:24)
Nintendo switch was also announced this (5:22 - 5:25)
is where you guys are gonna be like oh (5:24 - 5:29)
the oh my gosh an expansion path no I (5:25 - 5:33)
just think um I think is that the (5:29 - 5:35)
entirety of the press release it's (5:33 - 5:38)
actually long the Pokemon company (5:35 - 5:40)
international and Nintendo announced new (5:38 - 5:42)
downloadable content they call that DLC (5:40 - 5:45)
here for the Pokemon sword and Pokemon (5:42 - 5:47)
shield video games the Pokemon sword (5:45 - 5:48)
expansion and the Pokemon shield (5:47 - 5:50)
expansion pass will contain the island (5:48 - 5:54)
of armor and the crown tundra expansions (5:50 - 5:56)
two separate Avengers that will enable (5:54 - 5:58)
fans to meet new characters catch newly (5:56 - 6:00)
discovered Pokemon and explore new areas (5:58 - 6:03)
of the gala region available now (6:00 - 6:05)
exclusively on Nintendo's switch systems (6:03 - 6:07)
pokemon sword and pokemon shield are the (6:05 - 6:10)
fastest selling Nintendo switch titles (6:07 - 6:13)
of all time and the highest-grossing (6:10 - 6:16)
launch of any pokemon game with more (6:13 - 6:18)
than 6 million units sold worldwide (6:16 - 6:23)
during launch weekend we're gonna repeat (6:18 - 6:28)
that sentence real quick for our (6:23 - 6:30)
prosperity safe for all or maybe all the (6:28 - 6:32)
national Dexter's who might still listen (6:30 - 6:34)
to the show oh we're gonna talk about (6:32 - 6:39)
that event available now exclusively on (6:34 - 6:40)
the Nintendo switch systems pokemon (6:39 - 6:43)
sword and pokemon shield are the fastest (6:40 - 6:47)
selling Nintendo switch games of all (6:43 - 6:50)
time and it had the highest to believe (6:47 - 6:53)
bro sit well with all the shortcuts they (6:50 - 6:56)
took and the highest grossing launch of (6:53 - 7:00)
any Pokemon game and the lack of content (6:56 - 7:02)
with more than 6 million units sold (7:00 - 7:04)
during launch weekend so that's like a (7:02 - 7:07)
weird sentence it is a weird sentence (7:04 - 7:09)
the first no if it's written weird but (7:07 - 7:11)
you definitely read it weird so the (7:09 - 7:12)
first part baits that makes sense (7:11 - 7:15)
faster selling them Zelda Mario Mario (7:12 - 7:20)
Party what are there else breath of the (7:15 - 7:22)
wild breath of the wild but to be fair (7:20 - 7:25)
brothel wall came out the same day the (7:22 - 7:28)
Nintendo switch came out hmm - you would (7:25 - 7:31)
have had to buy a switch and it sells at (7:28 - 7:32)
the same time (7:31 - 7:35)
what about Katamari Damacy you know I (7:32 - 7:37)
think I think I think Pokemon has a (7:35 - 7:38)
slight edge without the hot that's not (7:37 - 7:41)
the hot seller you think it is well it (7:38 - 7:45)
is in my house in this house but we are (7:41 - 7:48)
a minority highest-grossing launch of (7:45 - 7:51)
any Pokemon game with more than 6 (7:48 - 7:52)
million units sold worldwide during (7:51 - 7:54)
launch weekend that is a weird sentence (7:52 - 7:56)
because they say the highest-grossing (7:54 - 7:58)
launch of any Pokemon game which would (7:56 - 8:00)
mean that the Pokemon game that made the (7:58 - 8:03)
most money and then they say 6 million (8:00 - 8:05)
units and then they say launch weekend (8:03 - 8:07)
so what's a what is a launch weekend to (8:05 - 8:09)
them is that Friday Saturday Sunday is (8:07 - 8:13)
that Saturday Sunday is that Thursday (8:09 - 8:14)
Friday Saturday Sunday (8:13 - 8:16)
it's probably like similar to movies (8:14 - 8:18)
which is Friday Saturday Sunday yeah I (8:16 - 8:20)
was gonna say that actually Thursday (8:18 - 8:22)
night Friday Saturday Thursday night (8:20 - 8:24)
midnight Friday Saturday Sunday (8:22 - 8:26)
remember when new music albums used to (8:24 - 8:28)
come out on Mondays at midnight I (8:26 - 8:30)
remember like lining up at the record (8:28 - 8:32)
store new release Tuesdays were a big (8:30 - 8:34)
deal of course you didn't matter that (8:32 - 8:35)
they came out at midnight because (8:34 - 8:38)
nothing was open well no there were some (8:35 - 8:40)
albums that came out where their store (8:38 - 8:41)
would open at midnight and you'd leave (8:40 - 8:43)
would line up and you're like oh I'm (8:41 - 8:45)
gonna get Radiohead's okay computer that (8:43 - 8:48)
was pretty rare oh it's no Harry Potter (8:45 - 8:51)
yeah maybe not rare here but in DC it (8:48 - 8:53)
was pretty popular you get this out of (8:51 - 8:54)
the way real quick during the Pokemon (8:53 - 8:56)
Direct presentation the Pokemon company (8:54 - 8:58)
international in Tendo also unveiled (8:56 - 9:00)
pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team DX (8:58 - 9:02)
this game revisits the classic pokemon (9:00 - 9:04)
mystery dungeon games poke my mystery (9:02 - 9:06)
dungeon rescue red rescue team and (9:04 - 9:08)
pokemon mystery dungeon blue rescue team (9:06 - 9:10)
which were originally released in the (9:08 - 9:14)
u.s. in 2006 now then tell us which (9:10 - 9:16)
systems and the updated visuals of a (9:14 - 9:19)
stunning picture book art style pokemon (9:16 - 9:21)
mystery dungeon rescue team DX launches (9:19 - 9:25)
on March 6 2020 I am actually excited (9:21 - 9:29)
for this because I had I remember the (9:25 - 9:31)
pokemon mystery dungeon the first ones (9:29 - 9:34)
came out they actually came out as both (9:31 - 9:38)
Gameboy Advance and Nintendo DS titles (9:34 - 9:41)
if you recall that yeah (9:38 - 9:44)
I had one on a trip that I took to (9:41 - 9:46)
Dallas because 2006 was a really hard (9:44 - 9:48)
year for me and I just I remember I had (9:46 - 9:51)
the player guide and the game and I was (9:48 - 9:55)
super excited for it and eventually that (9:51 - 9:56)
petered out because I had too many other (9:55 - 9:58)
things to do with my life so I'm kind of (9:56 - 9:59)
like excited to look at the first (9:58 - 10:01)
pokemon mystery dungeon again on the (9:59 - 10:03)
switch and then see like maybe it's (10:01 - 10:06)
gonna reignite my spark for it there's (10:03 - 10:07)
more information about that bolo will (10:06 - 10:08)
will circle back to the mystery dungeon (10:07 - 10:11)
stuff here in a little bit so that was (10:08 - 10:13)
all that was in the announcement was (10:11 - 10:17)
they opened with the mystery dungeon (10:13 - 10:19)
stuff which I have thoughts on then they (10:17 - 10:21)
went into the expansion pass and then (10:19 - 10:24)
they said that Pokemon home will be (10:21 - 10:27)
coming in February but no details at the (10:24 - 10:29)
time which is both like exciting and (10:27 - 10:33)
worrisome they're like hey next month (10:29 - 10:34)
this huge thing that's supposed to (10:33 - 10:37)
appear on your switch and your phone's (10:34 - 10:40)
is supposed to come out and it's (10:37 - 10:41)
supposed to be better than bank but we (10:40 - 10:44)
have no details we're not gonna tell you (10:41 - 10:47)
anything about it at this point I'm (10:44 - 10:49)
suspecting that it's gonna come out on (10:47 - 10:51)
switch but not on the phones right away (10:49 - 10:53)
I bet that I bet that part's gonna be (10:51 - 10:55)
delayed I would agree with you and (10:53 - 10:57)
that's fine it's nothing in the world I (10:55 - 10:58)
just I just need a place to dump my (10:57 - 11:02)
Pokemon and swords or whatever it is as (10:58 - 11:03)
long as it lets me dump my Pokemon (11:02 - 11:08)
agreed all right the Pokemon sword and (11:03 - 11:09)
the Pokemon Shield expansion pack (11:08 - 11:12)
trainers will be able to jump right into (11:09 - 11:15)
the adventure with the same save data (11:12 - 11:16)
that they've been using to play pokemon (11:15 - 11:18)
sword in Pokemon shield they will also (11:16 - 11:21)
be able to begin exploring the island of (11:18 - 11:23)
armor in the crown Tundra at almost any (11:21 - 11:26)
point in the main games whether a (11:23 - 11:28)
trainer has recently started their (11:26 - 11:30)
journey in the gala region or as well (11:28 - 11:32)
along the path of becoming champion they (11:30 - 11:35)
will be able to enjoy the new content as (11:32 - 11:37)
soon as it's released and there's a (11:35 - 11:40)
little one here so bullet point number (11:37 - 11:45)
one footnote but no but no players will (11:40 - 11:47)
need to reach the wild area in Pokemon (11:45 - 11:49)
Sword and Pokemon shield in order to (11:47 - 11:52)
explore the island of armor or the crown (11:49 - 11:54)
Tundra this occurs about two hours of (11:52 - 11:54)
gameplay (11:54 - 11:57)
though individual gameplay may vary (11:54 - 12:00)
that's pretty fair I think yeah get to (11:57 - 12:02)
the wild area which is still before the (12:00 - 12:04)
first gym and you will be able to go to (12:02 - 12:07)
the other areas is this is where we like (12:04 - 12:11)
speculate of like what this like what (12:07 - 12:13)
happens exactly in this content if (12:11 - 12:16)
what's to speculate they told us (12:13 - 12:19)
everything you go to the fighting dojo (12:16 - 12:22)
you have your your rival you get to play (12:19 - 12:25)
with a slowpoke which let me say before (12:22 - 12:28)
anybody else gets to speak if you do not (12:25 - 12:31)
catch glare and slowpoke in a heel ball (12:28 - 12:34)
you've done it wrong glare and slowpoke (12:31 - 12:37)
is yellow and pink a heel ball is yellow (12:34 - 12:39)
and pink (12:37 - 12:40)
what if you're trying to get a shiny one (12:39 - 12:43)
then the heel ball doesn't match it (12:40 - 12:46)
anymore but look Chinese are wasted on (12:43 - 12:51)
me when do I get to express my (12:46 - 12:53)
disappointment about DLC soon we gotta (12:51 - 12:56)
get through the no you don't get to cuz (12:53 - 12:58)
I'm gonna not let you I'm gonna I'm (12:56 - 13:02)
gonna filibuster so there's when I when (12:58 - 13:05)
I stream on Twitch there there are I get (13:02 - 13:07)
I get the benefit of people being like I (13:05 - 13:09)
love the podcast and I can't believe (13:07 - 13:10)
will hasn't beat the game yet so I get a (13:09 - 13:13)
lot of that yes I get that on [ __ ] - (13:10 - 13:16)
y'all can stop okay you are my bad you (13:13 - 13:18)
want me to help you and I'm like I can't (13:16 - 13:21)
there's no helping will okay okay what (13:18 - 13:23)
do you want me to here here's the update (13:21 - 13:26)
for the week I was like let me make this (13:23 - 13:28)
interesting for myself so I was like you (13:26 - 13:30)
know I would really enjoy having an all (13:28 - 13:32)
Ghost type team so I put together this (13:30 - 13:34)
nice pretty well-balanced all Ghost type (13:32 - 13:35)
team I think it was like this is gonna (13:34 - 13:39)
be fun and I played for like 10 minutes (13:35 - 13:43)
and literally every Pokemon I was up (13:39 - 13:46)
against knew a dark-type move and used a (13:43 - 13:48)
dark-type move and wiped out my ghost (13:46 - 13:50)
type see why is Galler full of everybody (13:48 - 13:52)
playing Dark type moves and making this (13:50 - 13:54)
game miserable for me why couldn't I (13:52 - 13:57)
just have a pass on that 200 IQ we tell (13:54 - 14:03)
the gallery 5 5 5 d chests and I'm like (13:57 - 14:06)
I'm not here for it I look at look (14:03 - 14:08)
here's newsflash (14:06 - 14:10)
this game has converted me into a (14:08 - 14:12)
pokemon mystery dungeon player that's (14:10 - 14:16)
that bad like mom who just tried to play (14:12 - 14:17)
it mystery dungeon we'll see how long (14:16 - 14:18)
that lasts (14:17 - 14:22)
see so so the the theory all weekend was (14:18 - 14:25)
will is gonna hate the DLC and Greg is (14:22 - 14:38)
gonna love the DLC but going back to you (14:25 - 14:42)
can go to the new DLC at any point in (14:38 - 14:46)
time how I guess are they gonna scale it (14:42 - 14:48)
if your level 15 and how are they gonna (14:46 - 14:51)
scale it if you're a level a hundred (14:48 - 14:54)
what granted you beat the game if (14:51 - 14:56)
there's like more story content (14:54 - 14:58)
I doubt the team to scale it at all (14:56 - 15:00)
they're gonna do it like the wild area (14:58 - 15:01)
where you go and it's just like well (15:00 - 15:04)
your level for Pokemon but you're (15:01 - 15:08)
running into this level 50 pangoro stuff (15:04 - 15:10)
makes sense but if there's like trainers (15:08 - 15:13)
you have to battle to you know if if for (15:10 - 15:16)
some reason this fighting dojo is let's (15:13 - 15:18)
assume that it's like a Jim Jim (15:16 - 15:20)
challenge what level is that Jim (15:18 - 15:22)
challenge gonna be at to get to the end (15:20 - 15:24)
of the fighting dojo - I assume the (15:22 - 15:26)
fighting fighting dojo is good to do (15:24 - 15:29)
something III don't assume that that's (15:26 - 15:32)
just gonna be a gym challenge and then (15:29 - 15:33)
you're done and then you never go back (15:32 - 15:33)
to it again (15:33 - 15:36)
I'm assuming it's probably a mechanic (15:33 - 15:41)
that the I don't know like it changes (15:36 - 15:46)
Rotom or Landorus or teaches your (15:41 - 15:49)
starters how to Dynomax or something it (15:46 - 15:52)
worries me that there's that there's not (15:49 - 15:54)
going to be a lot of story that they are (15:52 - 15:58)
just going to be expanded wild areas and (15:54 - 15:58)
maybe a little bit of hey this feature (15:59 - 16:05)
opens like the dojo is akin to the (16:02 - 16:07)
nursery or to the battle tower and (16:05 - 16:10)
there's not much more to it I'm worried (16:07 - 16:13)
I'm worried about that with this sort of (16:10 - 16:16)
you can go there at any time because if (16:13 - 16:20)
it's just a wild area huh no so (16:16 - 16:22)
so what I'm thinking is when they say (16:20 - 16:23)
you can go there at any time is that you (16:22 - 16:26)
can go and you can do the part that is (16:23 - 16:28)
the wild area part where it's like the (16:26 - 16:31)
free roaming camera and you like can go (16:28 - 16:33)
in any direction and visit an area but (16:31 - 16:36)
once you get to the actual dojo building (16:33 - 16:38)
and try to start doing tasks in the dojo (16:36 - 16:40)
a building that those will be gated and (16:38 - 16:42)
that you'll have to be at certain levels (16:40 - 16:44)
in order to do those sections and it's (16:42 - 16:46)
like you can come here doesn't mean (16:44 - 16:48)
you're gonna be able to do anything Tom (16:46 - 16:51)
that's probably realistic and I I guess (16:48 - 16:53)
yeah Greg makes a good point where it (16:51 - 16:56)
could be like the battle power is that (16:53 - 16:59)
we said we're yeah they could just be (16:56 - 17:01)
like alright this might be of a series (16:59 - 17:03)
of challenges but we're gonna scale you (17:01 - 17:07)
to 50 yeah which i think maybe is like (17:03 - 17:09)
the best way to do it when I think of (17:07 - 17:11)
battle dojo I think of like oh it's (17:09 - 17:13)
probably a lot of battles see this just (17:11 - 17:16)
sort of tackles on my nervousness about (17:13 - 17:20)
paying $30 for another battle tower in a (17:16 - 17:23)
new wild area I paid $30 for more wild (17:20 - 17:27)
area I don't know if I would pay $30 for (17:23 - 17:29)
an extra battle tower so I haven't even (17:27 - 17:31)
gone through battle tower in the first (17:29 - 17:31)
game (17:31 - 17:35)
yeah I'm just okay I'm concerned I have (17:31 - 17:37)
strong concerns all right let's break (17:35 - 17:39)
this down even more the island of armor (17:37 - 17:41)
is scheduled to release at the end of (17:39 - 17:45)
June 2020 the crown tundra in the fall (17:41 - 17:48)
of 2020 assume probably November (17:45 - 17:52)
probably know that man yes the Pope so (17:48 - 17:56)
does anybody else find the sort of (17:52 - 18:00)
Japanese Chinese style that they have (17:56 - 18:02)
for the clothing and for the main (18:00 - 18:04)
character a vial of armor a little they (18:02 - 18:08)
have a large immigrant community from (18:04 - 18:12)
East Asia that only live on this island (18:08 - 18:13)
have you met Laura (18:12 - 18:16)
immigrant communities yes it makes a (18:13 - 18:18)
little bit more sense when we get to the (18:16 - 18:21)
legendary Pokemon I think we'll circle (18:18 - 18:24)
back to the I mean I know what you're (18:21 - 18:25)
talking about and I don't agree but yeah (18:24 - 18:29)
all right good I'm glad that you're the (18:25 - 18:36)
bank's redemption the tables have turned (18:29 - 18:38)
I mean there is one very simple reason (18:36 - 18:42)
why I am all in on this content and if (18:38 - 18:44)
people didn't recognize that just from (18:42 - 18:47)
the video then you guys don't know me at (18:44 - 18:52)
all okay the pokemon sword expansion (18:47 - 18:53)
pass in the pokemon shield expansion (18:52 - 18:56)
pack will include both sets of content (18:53 - 18:57)
this is also very confusing and I had to (18:56 - 18:59)
explain this like a million times this (18:57 - 19:01)
weekend which will be available for (18:59 - 19:03)
pre-purchase for a suggested retail (19:01 - 19:06)
price of $29.99 starting later today (19:03 - 19:09)
January 9th both expansions will include (19:06 - 19:11)
new areas to explore new discoverable (19:09 - 19:14)
Pokemon clothing items handy features (19:11 - 19:15)
and more (19:14 - 19:18)
in addition fans can receive a special (19:15 - 19:20)
bonus while purchasing the expansion (19:18 - 19:22)
pass a Pikachu uniform and a Eevee (19:20 - 19:25)
uniform fans will be able to receive the (19:22 - 19:27)
Pikachu and Evie uniforms in pokemon (19:25 - 19:28)
sword and shield by using the codes they (19:27 - 19:30)
were receive after they purchased the (19:28 - 19:32)
expansion pass I just want to get the (19:30 - 19:34)
price thing out of the way this is very (19:32 - 19:36)
confusing I'll make this as simple as I (19:34 - 19:40)
think I can if you own one copy of the (19:36 - 19:42)
game let's just say you went out and you (19:40 - 19:45)
bought pokemon sword because you liked (19:42 - 19:47)
wolf having a sword in its mouth you're (19:45 - 19:50)
a huge Dark Souls fan you only at most (19:47 - 19:54)
have to spend $29 30 bucks you will get (19:50 - 19:59)
both Tundra and the other armor for 30 (19:54 - 20:03)
bucks gets you both well plus tag if you (19:59 - 20:06)
like it's pretty 99 plus it's like 33 (20:03 - 20:09)
bucks if you own both copies of sword (20:06 - 20:12)
and shield because you wanted to give (20:09 - 20:15)
Game Freak 120 dollars instead of $60 (20:12 - 20:17)
then you have to give them another $60 (20:15 - 20:20)
if you want buddy another 30 oh you oh (20:17 - 20:22)
okay I know what you're saying yeah okay (20:20 - 20:25)
yes if you want both for both games now (20:22 - 20:27)
I don't know if they're gonna (20:25 - 20:28)
you know if you're gonna be able to walk (20:27 - 20:30)
in the target they're gonna have a (20:28 - 20:32)
little DLC thing on the shelf and that (20:30 - 20:34)
will probably not work and be compatible (20:32 - 20:35)
I don't know if they're growing that (20:34 - 20:37)
route we also don't know it for like (20:35 - 20:39)
Christmas they're going to sell maybe (20:37 - 20:42)
like an Ultimate Edition or an actual (20:39 - 20:45)
physical copy of these games that (20:42 - 20:48)
already have both on the Shelf ideally (20:45 - 20:50)
there's still an importance to having (20:48 - 20:53)
your game on on retail shelves well also (20:50 - 20:56)
when you go to the the menu screen (20:53 - 20:58)
in-game like to the save menu there is (20:56 - 21:01)
now a link that says click here to get (20:58 - 21:03)
the expansion pack it's like no thought (21:01 - 21:06)
required I think at least from where I'm (21:03 - 21:07)
coming from I don't actually know if (21:06 - 21:10)
it's worth it to buy it on both games (21:07 - 21:14)
because most and everyone's different (21:10 - 21:16)
but most people who buy both games they (21:14 - 21:17)
do it because they want to like trade (21:16 - 21:19)
with themselves and they want to catch (21:17 - 21:22)
you know both subs like a lot of people (21:19 - 21:24)
aren't giving away there's a she and (21:22 - 21:25)
rosamma Zenta so if you buy both games (21:24 - 21:27)
you'll be able to get both transfer them (21:25 - 21:29)
to one and most people have like a main (21:27 - 21:32)
game like my main game is shield mine (21:29 - 21:32)
too (21:32 - 21:34)
but I have gone my hat I have gone (21:32 - 21:37)
through sword because you know like I (21:34 - 21:38)
said no one's gonna trade me there's a (21:37 - 21:39)
she and no one gonna trade me their (21:38 - 21:40)
titanal they probably evolved it to (21:39 - 21:44)
Saval I but like if I bought the DLC on (21:40 - 21:47)
shield and I go through it unless I want (21:44 - 21:49)
to like experience that like DLC (21:47 - 21:51)
specifically again but at that point we (21:49 - 21:53)
don't even know how much story there is (21:51 - 21:55)
so is it worth it to buy it on the game (21:53 - 21:57)
I barely play to go through a wild area (21:55 - 21:59)
when I can get all the benefits of a (21:57 - 22:01)
wild area and the other one so I don't (21:59 - 22:03)
know if you really need to buy both have (22:01 - 22:05)
you owned both games I mean there's a (22:03 - 22:09)
couple of things that I I mean I bought (22:05 - 22:11)
both we do know that there's probably (22:09 - 22:12)
going to be exclusive between both (22:11 - 22:19)
definitely and I think the I love armor (22:12 - 22:24)
legendary that has two forms might be (22:19 - 22:26)
exclusive to each there's that so I have (22:24 - 22:31)
purchased both I mean I as as much as (22:26 - 22:34)
I'm skeptical about this whole thing I (22:31 - 22:37)
have paid them by 62 others because of (22:34 - 22:39)
the potential for exclusive exclusivity (22:37 - 22:40)
yeah (22:39 - 22:42)
okay so the difference here between the (22:40 - 22:44)
two and the island of armor in this (22:42 - 22:46)
expansion trainers will head to the (22:44 - 22:49)
island of armor the stage of a new (22:46 - 22:52)
adventure in the gala region the island (22:49 - 22:53)
of armor is a giant island full of (22:52 - 22:56)
environments not seen in gala before the (22:53 - 22:58)
players will find wave swept beaches (22:56 - 23:02)
forced bogs caves and sand dunes there (22:58 - 23:03)
are also plenty of Pokemon that will (23:02 - 23:06)
make the island their home living freely (23:03 - 23:09)
amid the lush natural surroundings (23:06 - 23:11)
there's even a dojo there that will (23:09 - 23:13)
specialize in some very particular (23:11 - 23:16)
training styles trainers and their (23:13 - 23:18)
pokémon will take up apprenticeship (23:16 - 23:20)
under the master of this dojo to train (23:18 - 23:23)
hard and become stronger the crown (23:20 - 23:26)
Tundra view on the other hand are we are (23:23 - 23:27)
we not going to talk about the other new (23:26 - 23:29)
Pokemon in the isle of armor I try to go (23:27 - 23:32)
I'm trying to go an order here (23:29 - 23:34)
what or dive the order the press release (23:32 - 23:37)
press release to her I don't have it (23:34 - 23:39)
send it to me this expansion is set in (23:37 - 23:42)
the snow swept realm of the crown tundra (23:39 - 23:44)
of the crown tundra features a beautiful (23:42 - 23:47)
shining silvery landscape in this frigid (23:44 - 23:49)
area with the jagged wintered mountains (23:47 - 23:51)
people live in small communities where (23:49 - 23:52)
they rely on each other (23:51 - 23:55)
SOS confirmed that's not true a certain (23:52 - 23:58)
Pokemon will appear a certain Pokemon (23:55 - 24:01)
will appoint the player as the leader of (23:58 - 24:03)
the exploration team in the crown Tundra (24:01 - 24:05)
where trainers will be tasked with (24:03 - 24:07)
investigating the reaches of this frozen (24:05 - 24:09)
land your trainers will be able to (24:07 - 24:11)
explore the full depth of Pokemon dens (24:09 - 24:14)
which they have only been able to see a (24:11 - 24:16)
glimpse of in machs raid battles so (24:14 - 24:18)
you're going underground it's (24:16 - 24:21)
fascinating so you get to go and (24:18 - 24:23)
actually explore the full Den like (24:21 - 24:25)
instead of just popping in fighting the (24:23 - 24:27)
thing at the opening and then leaving (24:25 - 24:30)
like you get to move around in these (24:27 - 24:31)
things you're gonna find out where (24:30 - 24:33)
they're hoarding all those TRS berries (24:31 - 24:35)
yeah but what's like a full debt as a (24:33 - 24:37)
full den like I went through the ultra (24:35 - 24:40)
wormhole I made it to sell Astellas land (24:37 - 24:42)
and I like did the most simplest puzzle (24:40 - 24:45)
ever to that encounter it's probably (24:42 - 24:48)
newly discovered Pokemon let's start off (24:45 - 24:53)
with cub foo which is the Wu the wushu (24:48 - 24:54)
Pokemon it (24:53 - 24:58)
the fighting type two feet tall American (24:54 - 25:02)
feet of course 26.5 American pounds so (24:58 - 25:04)
probably a little bit heavier than your (25:02 - 25:07)
cat a little bit the ability inner focus (25:04 - 25:10)
cub who will appear in the island of (25:07 - 25:12)
armor this Pokemon is hardworking and (25:10 - 25:14)
strives to Train both its body and its (25:12 - 25:18)
mind it uses each to defeat as (25:14 - 25:20)
motivation training itself with even (25:18 - 25:23)
more vigor after a loss in order to grow (25:20 - 25:27)
stronger it has an organ that produces (25:23 - 25:29)
fighting energy in its lower abdomen and (25:27 - 25:31)
before heading into battle cub who will (25:29 - 25:34)
release energy through unique breathing (25:31 - 25:37)
techniques and intense focus wild cub (25:34 - 25:40)
foo live in the mountains mountainous (25:37 - 25:42)
areas far away from the gala region but (25:40 - 25:45)
it was once a species that called Galler (25:42 - 25:47)
its home it's noted in historical texts (25:45 - 25:50)
that this Pokemon species used to head (25:47 - 25:52)
to uncharted lands with people as they (25:50 - 25:55)
set out to trade or explore records (25:52 - 25:56)
suggest that cub few living in faraway (25:55 - 25:59)
mountains today have descended from cub (25:56 - 26:02)
foo cub foo Cub Foods that became (25:59 - 26:05)
naturalized to the distant lands in (26:02 - 26:09)
visited journeys kept food the Conqueror (26:05 - 26:13)
Pokemon no the new Pokemon oh sorry I (26:09 - 26:15)
liked it better the first time they did (26:13 - 26:17)
it and it was called Pancham thank you (26:15 - 26:20)
Pancham was robbed Pancham has been (26:17 - 26:24)
robbed that's all I had to say no I kind (26:20 - 26:25)
of like how some Pokemon are very (26:24 - 26:30)
similar to each other like Dione say and (26:25 - 26:38)
the thing that no one cares about oh you (26:30 - 26:46)
mean the mechanical Pokemon the gem crib (26:38 - 26:57)
the thing that Sableye eat they love the (26:46 - 26:58)
worst host ever (26:57 - 27:00)
what is the colonists like Rock fear (26:58 - 27:08)
yeah carving wait dance (27:00 - 27:12)
is a carbon it's a special carving yeah (27:08 - 27:14)
but they're not like carving doesn't (27:12 - 27:17)
evolve into the an se but now but still (27:14 - 27:20)
still in the Lord ANSI is a special (27:17 - 27:22)
carving it's not just like where they (27:20 - 27:26)
like copied and pasted pancham and then (27:22 - 27:28)
just took the lead out of its mouth and (27:26 - 27:30)
said okay you're the QT fighting pokémon (27:28 - 27:32)
now Pancham you're yesterday's hot trash (27:30 - 27:36)
I think they maybe allude to it being a (27:32 - 27:39)
sudden transformation of a carbon (27:36 - 27:40)
alright never mind the pokedex entry (27:39 - 27:44)
says look anderson does been doing (27:40 - 27:45)
pokemon of the week for a fair number of (27:44 - 27:47)
years to have picked up on that little (27:45 - 27:49)
nugget of knowledge right there there (27:47 - 27:51)
there is like loves whiskey and a Lowell (27:49 - 27:53)
Imola yes which should have been (27:51 - 27:55)
connected there's miltank and tauros (27:53 - 27:56)
should have been connected and (27:55 - 27:59)
bouffalant it's somewhere out there so (27:56 - 28:05)
we're out there in do as your resident (27:59 - 28:08)
zoologist for the next 45 seconds like (28:05 - 28:12)
elegant ways and crocodiles they're kind (28:08 - 28:14)
of similar but actually pronounced to (28:12 - 28:19)
zoologist you know frogs and toads hey (28:14 - 28:24)
ya know I like the design I still think (28:19 - 28:29)
I still think that the that clear (28:24 - 28:32)
Japanese influence just is a little (28:29 - 28:35)
weird out like I want to use influence (28:32 - 28:38)
that could be I mean I don't know (28:35 - 28:41)
exactly with a headband style comes from (28:38 - 28:44)
wu-tang clang that's why it's the wushu (28:41 - 28:46)
Pokemon does that make sense (28:44 - 28:49)
well what fighting what fighting styles (28:46 - 28:52)
wushu like Oh whooshes Chinese okay yeah (28:49 - 28:54)
yeah that sounds right (28:52 - 28:56)
i all right I'm looking at blue shoe (28:54 - 28:59)
okay sport will you or Chinese kung-fu (28:56 - 29:04)
yes it's a wushu is the where they smoke (28:59 - 29:06)
it and it's like shredded cabbage and (29:04 - 29:09)
young it with the little pancakes no (29:06 - 29:13)
Maya wushu pork you know you can't have (29:09 - 29:15)
that as a soy don't you tell me what I (29:13 - 29:18)
can I have I mean I'm not telling you (29:15 - 29:20)
your body is telling you I can't even (29:18 - 29:22)
tell you a lot about American history (29:20 - 29:24)
the only thing I learned in grade school (29:22 - 29:25)
elementary school and the high school is (29:24 - 29:28)
there was a Civil War and Abraham (29:25 - 29:29)
Lincoln and slavery that's pretty much (29:28 - 29:32)
all they reiterate at least in MPs what (29:29 - 29:34)
about George Washington I don't think we (29:32 - 29:35)
learned anything about George Washington (29:34 - 29:38)
Thomas Jefferson I want I don't think so (29:35 - 29:41)
either I'm being I listen to the (29:38 - 29:43)
Hamilton soundtrack I know this to be (29:41 - 29:46)
true I know who you are married to you (29:43 - 29:48)
have been forced to listen to the (29:46 - 29:50)
Hamilton sound that's true I didn't (29:48 - 29:52)
learn that in MPs I'm just saying (29:50 - 29:55)
MPs just reiterates this award over and (29:52 - 29:57)
over again Milwaukee Public Schools I (29:55 - 30:00)
feel like there's like a small amount of (29:57 - 30:05)
history with Europe and China I mean (30:00 - 30:09)
right there is I mean so like it's (30:05 - 30:11)
playing a little bit off of the whole (30:09 - 30:14)
Marco Polo idea like they went out with (30:11 - 30:17)
traitors and then they all left (30:14 - 30:20)
completely and just stayed there like (30:17 - 30:25)
okay like there are no there no of the (30:20 - 30:27)
original left like everybody took them (30:25 - 30:29)
and we're like well we're going take (30:27 - 30:31)
yeah I'm confused on the direction of (30:29 - 30:35)
this are they saying that the what was (30:31 - 30:43)
his name come poo poo pretty good then (30:35 - 30:46)

Cubs you half Pancham whatever that it (30:46 - 30:51)
came from gallery and went to Asia or (30:49 - 30:54)
you came from Asia to Galler now it's (30:51 - 30:58)
come back from Asia to gallery it (30:54 - 31:00)
started and they all left apparently or (30:58 - 31:02)
I'd never them left that the species (31:00 - 31:06)
died out dark and yeah now they're back (31:02 - 31:08)
now that opened up this dojo on the Isle (31:06 - 31:11)
well it's just what is it called when (31:08 - 31:13)
all the continents are crammed up next (31:11 - 31:17)
to each other guy yeah Pangaea yeah (31:13 - 31:22)
that's a they left with people on trade (31:17 - 31:25)
there were vast traders on Pangaea you (31:22 - 31:27)
don't know you weren't there I was there (31:25 - 31:28)
I'm immortal (31:27 - 31:30)
it's disturbing pinchy I have a Civil (31:28 - 31:32)
War and was Abraham Lincoln involved (31:30 - 31:35)
well Abraham dinosaur Lincoln Oh cousin (31:32 - 31:36)
Paul (31:35 - 31:39)
okay so I I saw some people being very I (31:36 - 31:42)
saw a couple negative some negative (31:39 - 31:44)
comments about this because prior to (31:42 - 31:46)
these games coming out they said they (31:44 - 31:47)
really thought about the Pokemon that (31:46 - 31:49)
would live in the gala region and then (31:47 - 31:52)
some people complain that yes Europe or (31:49 - 31:55)
Great Britain is full of cactuses and (31:52 - 31:58)
elephants obviously that's not true (31:55 - 32:00)
obviously every Pokemon that is in (31:58 - 32:00)
Galler (32:00 - 32:04)
I mean isn't specifically I can feel it (32:00 - 32:06)
with the cactus but if you're gonna try (32:04 - 32:09)
to make a case that elephants with (32:06 - 32:12)
England's relationship mostly negative (32:09 - 32:14)
relationship with India doesn't mean (32:12 - 32:15)
that they would not have elephants (32:14 - 32:17)
that's like that's like glossing over (32:15 - 32:22)
that yes sir absolutely the name of the (32:17 - 32:25)
Pokemon is like almost derived from the (32:22 - 32:30)
in term yeah the elephant belongs there (32:25 - 32:32)
whether you like it or not you what (32:30 - 32:34)
whether you want to like talk about the (32:32 - 32:36)
dark history with India and the (32:34 - 32:38)
expansion of the British Empire (32:36 - 32:42)
like hmm I can see about the cactus but (32:38 - 32:44)
not about the elephant lack of Lily pup (32:42 - 32:47)
and Stalin and stuff were was also (32:44 - 32:49)
complained but if they really wanted to (32:47 - 32:51)
just be like British animals it would be (32:49 - 32:54)
like six ugly birds and a badger and and (32:51 - 33:00)
a grand bowl sure and II am Park has car (32:54 - 33:04)
keys I can get behind the the Chinese (33:00 - 33:08)
may be generalized Asian theme of cup (33:04 - 33:11)
foo in a British game because as (33:08 - 33:14)
somebody is gonna be lost on some people (33:11 - 33:17)
as somebody who watches watches a lot of (33:14 - 33:20)
Japanese wrestling they love to go out (33:17 - 33:24)
of their way to say that this Japanese (33:20 - 33:27)
megastar wrestler couldn't make it in (33:24 - 33:30)
Japan so they went to Mexico it's always (33:27 - 33:33)
Mexico always they'll be like because (33:30 - 33:35)
Mexico has a big history of luchador (33:33 - 33:36)
fight right so the long they'll always (33:35 - 33:39)
say like this wrestler who is now a (33:36 - 33:41)
megastar in Japan this Japanese wrestler (33:39 - 33:43)
who's a megastar in Japan didn't become (33:41 - 33:46)
a megastar until they realized that they (33:43 - 33:47)
couldn't make it (33:46 - 33:49)
they went to Mexico for four years they (33:47 - 33:52)
the Lucha Libre style they became this (33:49 - 33:54)
huge star in Mexico they came back and (33:52 - 33:56)
that's what made them a huge star in (33:54 - 33:58)
Japan this is always the story of (33:56 - 33:59)
Japanese wrestling (33:58 - 34:01)
I can definitely suspend my disbelief of (33:59 - 34:04)
this Pokemon started in Europe it (34:01 - 34:05)
couldn't make it (34:04 - 34:09)
it went to an Asian country it became it (34:05 - 34:13)
learned it learned the way of wushu and (34:09 - 34:15)
then it came back like that makes sense (34:13 - 34:17)
to me that glass over the problematic of (34:15 - 34:20)
couldn't make it and went to the (34:17 - 34:22)
mystical East to learn fighting like (34:20 - 34:25)
we're we're just gonna drop that whole (34:22 - 34:29)
line right now and same problem but fine (34:25 - 34:30)
they did it isn't that the story of the (34:29 - 34:31)
iron fist (34:30 - 34:34)
yes aren't there a lot of movies though (34:31 - 34:37)
that have this like trope oh yes okay (34:34 - 34:39)
that's why it's problematic why it's (34:37 - 34:44)
problematic I mean isn't really a trope (34:39 - 34:47)
of Japanese wrestlers are legit going to (34:44 - 34:49)
Mexico and then learning and then coming (34:47 - 34:52)
back yes because they're not legit going (34:49 - 34:54)
to Mexico are yeah no no they there they (34:52 - 34:58)
are I mean it is still a trope I mean (34:54 - 35:00)
it's a reverse trope but it's still a (34:58 - 35:04)
trope this is a legendary Pokemon for (35:00 - 35:08)
Oprah not it involves it involves to a (35:04 - 35:13)
Shifu which has two different warps (35:08 - 35:15)
which one will be sword when will be (35:13 - 35:17)
shield pick which is which right now (35:15 - 35:19)
which do you think is which I don't (35:17 - 35:22)
single strike and rapid strike one is (35:19 - 35:26)
fighting dark one is fighting water I'm (35:22 - 35:27)
gonna say the water one is shield I (35:26 - 35:29)
agree (35:27 - 35:32)
do we have any other water fighting (35:29 - 35:36)
fighting water program Poli Wow oh yeah (35:32 - 35:40)
the original Poli slap what what is it (35:36 - 35:42)
Poli work it's probably rally wrath (35:40 - 35:45)
Poliwrath is keldeo yah water fighting (35:42 - 35:48)
yeah Kelly is water fighting - this is (35:45 - 35:52)
fighting water it's different because (35:48 - 35:54)
the Fighting's first the water second (35:52 - 35:57)
yeah Calvillo Poliwrath and her Shifu (35:54 - 35:59)
are the only three that would be water (35:57 - 36:01)
fighting that's fine I was just curious (35:59 - 36:03)
both six three both two and (36:01 - 36:05)
and 31 pounds with the ability unseen (36:03 - 36:07)
fist which is a new ability that they (36:05 - 36:12)
don't describe they don't cup foo will (36:07 - 36:15)
evolve into your Shifu after it is (36:12 - 36:17)
undergone significant training (36:15 - 36:20)
it seems that oh she foo has two forms a (36:17 - 36:22)
single strike and rapid strike it (36:20 - 36:24)
appears that each form has different (36:22 - 36:28)
types as well her she few her Shifu in a (36:24 - 36:32)
single strike form style battles without (36:28 - 36:34)
holding anything back when enraged it (36:32 - 36:36)
will Mercy Mercy Li attack its opponents (36:34 - 36:39)
until utter defeat the single strike (36:36 - 36:41)
style Oh Shi Fu's movements are also (36:39 - 36:43)
direct and involved rushing forward in a (36:41 - 36:45)
straight line it will keep its distance (36:43 - 36:48)
from opponents at first and only leap in (36:45 - 36:50)
close instantly to deliver a powerful (36:48 - 36:53)
blow her Shifu in rapid strike style (36:50 - 36:56)
maintains a calm demeanor observing (36:53 - 36:58)
their opponents and measuring their (36:56 - 37:00)
strength while dodging attacks a rapid (36:58 - 37:03)
style her Shifu will use the flowing (37:00 - 37:06)
movements to battle smoothly to parry (37:03 - 37:08)
and opponents movements and then (37:06 - 37:10)
overwhelm the opponent with a furry fear (37:08 - 37:14)
of flurry or furry of rapid stress-free (37:10 - 37:18)
flurry of blizzards so we've had a (37:14 - 37:20)
couple Pokemon legendary pokémon evolve (37:18 - 37:25)
before specifically cosmogony to Cosmo (37:20 - 37:28)
um yeah into yeah yeah it's the new (37:25 - 37:31)
thing it's the new craze of the twenty (37:28 - 37:35)
teens I mean I say I like the design (37:31 - 37:37)
better than I like Cub whose design uh (37:35 - 37:39)
yeah I'm not super in love with them yet (37:37 - 37:44)
but I just if you know if they have that (37:39 - 37:46)
included Pancham in pangoro in these (37:44 - 37:48)
games if they had you excluded and then (37:46 - 37:49)
this was like a way of reintroducing (37:48 - 37:51)
them and some sort of more meta (37:49 - 37:53)
applicable manner I would have been like (37:51 - 37:57)
okay it's like Pancham is right there (37:53 - 37:59)
he's like on the outside of the window (37:57 - 38:01)
looking in and he's like I'm so sad I (37:59 - 38:04)
like a fighting dojo - yeah but what if (38:01 - 38:05)
what if wouldn't you would you go there (38:04 - 38:08)
they're like wrestling each other (38:05 - 38:10)
Pancham maybe I don't want to Mexico (38:08 - 38:12)
then can I say I would love to learn (38:10 - 38:14)
from you pinch and I don't want to learn (38:12 - 38:16)
from Mooseport sure what we're getting (38:14 - 38:19)
by them fighting each other when you (38:16 - 38:22)
arrive at the dojo other than it's good (38:19 - 38:31)
perfect I could just see them living (38:22 - 38:33)
together just the one happens to be (38:31 - 38:39)
legendary and one happening one travel (38:33 - 38:41)
to China (38:39 - 38:46)
Gregg and one came from there once an (38:41 - 38:48)
endangered species it will truly be (38:46 - 38:49)
legendary (38:48 - 38:55)
quite soon yeah they're fine I guess I (38:49 - 38:57)
don't know I'm not I'm not in love with (38:55 - 39:02)
these two pokémon there yeah I mean I'm (38:57 - 39:04)
sure I'll change my mind when I see them (39:02 - 39:05)
in motion and I have with most things (39:04 - 39:07)
well we also have to see what hidden (39:05 - 39:12)
piss does unseen fist because that could (39:07 - 39:13)
be a game changer (39:12 - 39:16)
so Giganta max single strike and rapid (39:13 - 39:18)
strike still the wushu Pokemon still (39:16 - 39:20)
fighting dark fighting waters still (39:18 - 39:25)
unseen fist single strike style / Shifu (39:20 - 39:28)
and rapid strike style your Shifu also (39:25 - 39:31)
have Giganta max forms Giganta max (39:28 - 39:33)
single strike style eat cheese (39:31 - 39:36)
come on Pokemon and this is a lot to say (39:33 - 39:39)
gigantic single strike style your Shifu (39:36 - 39:43)
looks like it's ready to bellow in fury (39:39 - 39:45)
people call it both the very embodiment (39:43 - 39:49)
of rage and a divine emissary that (39:45 - 39:52)
banishes evil spirits with fury Giganta (39:49 - 39:56)
max rapid strike style guru Shifu will (39:52 - 39:58)
quietly maintain its stance with a calm (39:56 - 40:00)
expression when facing this Pokemon it (39:58 - 40:04)
seems some will be greatly agitated (40:00 - 40:07)
feeling as very depths of their souls (40:04 - 40:10)
have been exposed yet others report (40:07 - 40:12)
feeling a sense of relief as if they've (40:10 - 40:14)
been cleansed of an evil spirit (40:12 - 40:19)
why is rapid strike style Giganta max or (40:14 - 40:23)
Shifu shorter then single strike file (40:19 - 40:26)
when they are the same size and I don't (40:23 - 40:31)
know it's its rapid strike style is at (40:26 - 40:33)
least in the image I'm looking at its (40:31 - 40:35)
higher because it's standing straight up (40:33 - 40:37)
on one leg with the other leg raised (40:35 - 40:39)
don't look at their heights (40:37 - 40:41)
look at their hands are different yeah (40:39 - 40:44)
the official height yeah yeah why is 110 (40:41 - 40:47)
feet different single strike is 90 to 95 (40:44 - 40:50)
feet and rapid strike is 85 feet and (40:47 - 40:54)
they both start at 6 3 yes (40:50 - 41:02)
why is me hmm you're 6 3 or 2 oh yeah I (40:54 - 41:04)
mean I know you're tall I just didn't (41:02 - 41:06)
know that you're for some reason I (41:04 - 41:08)
thought you're 61 (41:06 - 41:12)
hmm not quite look my entire height (41:08 - 41:14)
thing was destroyed by Brent long ago so (41:12 - 41:17)
I just yeah I just felt that weird like (41:14 - 41:22)
why why do they change height maybe the (41:17 - 41:25)
numbers mean something 1985 for single (41:22 - 41:27)
strike is also like the Giganta max (41:25 - 41:30)
forms is super red and then the rapid (41:27 - 41:34)
strike is super blue yeah yeah unless (41:30 - 41:35)
they do like black and white to show you (41:34 - 41:38)
where they they switch them right that (41:35 - 41:39)
was wonder that was the thing in black (41:38 - 41:40)
my - they switch the legendary pepra (41:39 - 41:44)
legendre's yeah what is the Japanese (41:40 - 41:46)
words four nine five two and eight five (41:44 - 41:50)
four I don't know hmm Andrew because it (41:46 - 41:52)
could be like the numbers on your Jersey (41:50 - 41:56)
Oh like a pause not a word yeah all (41:52 - 41:58)
right we got some new Pokemon and we got (41:56 - 42:00)
some more details kind of breaking down (41:58 - 42:01)
the differences between these two (42:00 - 42:02)
expansions but we're gonna take a break (42:01 - 42:05)
when we come back we'll do we'll go over (42:02 - 42:08)
these new Pokemon and we'll go over the (42:05 - 42:11)
rest of this DLC so we will be right (42:08 - 42:14)
back you're gonna think outside of the (42:11 - 42:19)
box yeah and outside of the bun (42:14 - 42:19)
[Music] (42:21 - 42:29)
I mean that's a pretty good saying yeah (42:23 - 42:42)
[Music] (42:29 - 42:45)
all right we got two new Pokemon (42:42 - 42:49)
starting with the legendary Pokemon kale (42:45 - 42:52)
Rex Cal Rex they say to the direct but (42:49 - 42:53)
now I can't remember how they said it (42:52 - 42:56)
I'll say kale Rex for now I'm probably (42:53 - 42:59)
wrong it is the king Pokemon it is (42:56 - 43:02)
psychic grass it is three feet seven (42:59 - 43:06)
inches a weight of 17 pounds as the (43:02 - 43:09)
ability unnerve trainers will encounter (43:06 - 43:12)
kale Rex in the crown of tunt the crown (43:09 - 43:15)
Tundra this Pokemon ruled all of Galler (43:12 - 43:18)
in ancient times though its appearance (43:15 - 43:21)
though it appears delicate and slight (43:18 - 43:24)
it's every move is filled with grace and (43:21 - 43:27)
dignity it also has an extremely high (43:24 - 43:30)
intelligence and it is said to see every (43:27 - 43:33)
past present and future event we've got (43:30 - 43:36)
what 17 different Pokemon types and we (43:33 - 43:40)
had to get another Celebi yeah you're (43:36 - 43:43)
out of ideas (43:40 - 43:43)
what possible site like the type makes (43:43 - 43:50)
sense for it but it didn't have to be (43:47 - 43:54)
grass what what do you see it's based (43:50 - 43:57)
off a flower okay well then let's base (43:54 - 43:59)
it off something else back to the very (43:57 - 44:01)
starting drawing board and say all right (43:59 - 44:03)
we've already done grass psychic let's (44:01 - 44:04)
do something different (44:03 - 44:07)
all right and then now what was it gonna (44:04 - 44:09)
look like and how can you not have like (44:07 - 44:14)
the big brain Pokemon that'd be psychic (44:09 - 44:19)
no psychic is fine that I'm fine with (44:14 - 44:22)
but why could it have been (44:19 - 44:24)
hey very psychic I don't know I Sai kit (44:22 - 44:29)
sure with everything I don't think it's (44:24 - 44:31)

psychic mr. rime but I'm talking about (44:40 - 44:47)
mythical biting psychic medicham I mean (44:43 - 44:49)
I'm fine with every mythical being a (44:47 - 44:52)
psychic but just like why did we have to (44:49 - 44:54)
get another Celebi yeah there are a lot (44:52 - 44:56)
of psychic mythical there Hoopa dark (44:54 - 44:59)
psychic like their psychic types and (44:56 - 45:01)
dragon types real dragon psychic that (44:59 - 45:04)
could have been great or psychic dragon (45:01 - 45:06)
I don't care one way or the other I mean (45:04 - 45:08)
like the is there a psychic dragon (45:06 - 45:11)
alternate cause ma lot T a lot to you oh (45:08 - 45:16)
yeah yeah I think the typing is fine I (45:11 - 45:18)
mean it's not like you can use mythical (45:16 - 45:19)
Pokemon in battles it's not like (45:18 - 45:21)
anyone's ever used their Celebi besides (45:19 - 45:23)
Jo (45:21 - 45:23)
it's his mascot (45:24 - 45:30)
there was my like the design kind of (45:27 - 45:33)
it's a little weird yeah I want to see (45:30 - 45:38)
it move it's a lot it just floats yeah (45:33 - 45:41)
like a like a dandelion on the weather (45:38 - 45:43)
it's weird deer rabbit head there was (45:41 - 45:45)
debate with this Pokemon of whether it (45:43 - 45:48)
was a deer or a rabbit I guess we end (45:45 - 45:51)
the debate here so it's a rabbit why do (45:48 - 45:56)
you say it's a rabbit the will sigh I (45:51 - 45:59)
mean I can definitely see it as a rabbit (45:56 - 46:00)
when you look at the drawing of it (45:59 - 46:04)
because it's not antlers it's just it (46:00 - 46:08)
has four ears Rex is a breed of rabbit (46:04 - 46:12)
it's also Latin for king yeah it's Latin (46:08 - 46:15)
for care and the there is a type of (46:12 - 46:18)
rabbit that is the the Rex there's a (46:15 - 46:22)
species of rabbit yes okay Cale it's (46:18 - 46:25)
kale --ax that part of its name comes (46:22 - 46:28)
from botany which is the outermost group (46:25 - 46:31)
of floral parts or like this it's Latin (46:28 - 46:37)
for bud so it is a king rabbit with the (46:31 - 46:40)
bud being its crown I wonder if it'll (46:37 - 46:44)
blossom I'm sure we'll have a form where (46:40 - 46:47)
it's bud brain opens up or something I (46:44 - 46:49)
don't understand like in the drawing (46:47 - 46:52)
what it's pointing at it so you over (46:49 - 46:56)
there over there it's a welcoming point (46:52 - 46:59)
come welcome to my home so this is like (46:56 - 47:02)
the third right the this is the kirim of (46:59 - 47:05)
the set this is the well not every (47:02 - 47:07)
Pokemon game had like three versions (47:05 - 47:10)
like ho and Lou gear just so low but you (47:07 - 47:12)
would assume that because this was the (47:10 - 47:15)
king joshey on and zama Zenta are the (47:12 - 47:17)
sword in the shield for the king right (47:15 - 47:22)
sure I mean you don't do but sure I mean (47:17 - 47:25)
why is it in a different area in that in (47:22 - 47:29)
I was in the crown Tundra yeah the crown (47:25 - 47:32)
it's the king I mean they don't really (47:29 - 47:35)
answer in the story why they covered up (47:32 - 47:38)
the fact that I mean (47:35 - 47:39)
I think wills gotten that far you gotten (47:38 - 47:41)
to the part where the copper Raja (47:39 - 47:44)
destroys that wall yeah (47:41 - 47:49)
spoiler they don't really answer why the (47:44 - 47:51)
entire game you're like why was this (47:49 - 47:54)
covered up yeah why was that sculpture (47:51 - 47:57)
hidden away and then Griffith and over (47:54 - 48:02)
in the in the Badu in where Sonya was (47:57 - 48:04)
like why is there only one hero when (48:02 - 48:06)
these scriptures here show that there (48:04 - 48:10)
are two heroes oh the mysteries that we (48:06 - 48:12)
still need to unraveled I mean I don't (48:10 - 48:15)
know that that's I mean it's it's like (48:12 - 48:19)
lost in time sort of a thing so I don't (48:15 - 48:20)
know that there's much more to it than (48:19 - 48:22)
people started believing it one way and (48:20 - 48:26)
then it made sense to have a hero it's (48:22 - 48:27)
just I don't know that there's much more (48:26 - 48:29)
than people thought it was one it's (48:27 - 48:31)
actually two you know yeah things get (48:29 - 48:33)
lost and uncovered all the time I mean I (48:31 - 48:35)
think what's more interesting is that we (48:33 - 48:37)
should talk about the fact that the (48:35 - 48:39)
darkest day happened at the same time (48:37 - 48:42)
kalos fired off the big weapon I mean (48:39 - 48:44)
they do say the darkness day is three (48:42 - 48:46)
thousand years ago and yep (48:44 - 48:49)
these thing was three thousand years (48:46 - 48:53)
there's three thousand years ago oh well (48:49 - 48:55)
there you go someday they're going to (48:53 - 48:56)
come out with one of those books like (48:55 - 48:58)
they did for Zelda that's like that (48:56 - 49:00)
lawyers all the entire history of the (48:58 - 49:03)
Pokemon world all these pieces are gonna (49:00 - 49:04)
fit together that's all the book does (49:03 - 49:08)
not put any pieces it's like real (49:04 - 49:11)
there's like a lot of stretches and our (49:08 - 49:13)
next new podcast Punk upon timeline will (49:11 - 49:15)
discuss how the multiple universes fit (49:13 - 49:16)
together (49:15 - 49:18)
I actually do like this Pokemon though I (49:16 - 49:20)
think it's cool looking I like I like (49:18 - 49:22)
the design at first I thought are we (49:20 - 49:24)
just not seeing all of it but then I (49:22 - 49:26)
realized when I finally saw pictures of (49:24 - 49:29)
it like oh no it is just it is upright (49:26 - 49:32)
with a little cape and a giant yeah a (49:29 - 49:36)
big big head little body big head of a (49:32 - 49:37)
body (49:36 - 49:40)
most psychics the standard trope of big (49:37 - 49:42)
head little body yeah I watch it to (49:40 - 49:45)
Keira I know how it goes (49:42 - 49:48)
regional forms of familiar Pokemon (49:45 - 49:50)
regional forms of certain Pokemon are (49:48 - 49:52)
found in Galler these forms have a (49:50 - 49:53)
Apted to the unique environment of the (49:52 - 49:55)
gala region and look different than the (49:53 - 49:57)
same species might look when found in (49:55 - 49:59)
other regions these adapted forms are (49:57 - 50:01)
known as gala forms of these pokemon and (49:59 - 50:03)
seemed to have behavior seem to have (50:01 - 50:05)
their be it behavior also differ from (50:03 - 50:08)
species previously discovered and then (50:05 - 50:10)
they show us glare and slowpoke (50:08 - 50:12)
which you can get as of this recording (50:10 - 50:18)
is the dopey pokemon it is 311 height 79 (50:12 - 50:21)
pounds the ability gluttony and own (50:18 - 50:23)
tempo its psychic the slowpoke of the (50:21 - 50:25)
gala region used to eat the seeds of (50:23 - 50:26)
certain plants that grew in their (50:25 - 50:30)
habitat these seeds were in fact Galeras (50:26 - 50:33)
chia seeds used to this day asthma spent (50:30 - 50:36)
essential spice for cooking in the gala (50:33 - 50:38)
region the slowpoke and gal are built up (50:36 - 50:40)
articles of the spice in their bodies (50:38 - 50:42)
over several generations even gaining (50:40 - 50:43)
the unique appearance and behavior they (50:42 - 50:46)
are known for today Valerians slowpokes (50:43 - 50:47)
spend their days wallowing on the (50:46 - 50:49)
seashore and in river bakes without (50:47 - 50:50)
thinking of anything in particular (50:49 - 50:53)
occasionally they might get a very sharp (50:50 - 50:55)
look in their eyes but they will soon (50:53 - 50:58)
revert to their zoned out expression it (50:55 - 51:00)
is thought that the behavior is caused (50:58 - 51:03)
by the accumulation of Galatia particles (51:00 - 51:05)
stimulating gallery' and slow pokes (51:03 - 51:08)
brain resulting in it thinking of (51:05 - 51:10)
something tremendous only for gallery' (51:08 - 51:12)
and slowpoke to immediately forget of (51:10 - 51:14)
what they thought hilarious (51:12 - 51:15)
can we just talk about how this is (51:14 - 51:19)
longer than every description of the (51:15 - 51:22)
very popular so that's very a lot of (51:19 - 51:25)
time on it yes gallery' and slowpoke can (51:22 - 51:27)
also evolve into gallery' and Slowbro if (51:25 - 51:29)
a specific item can be found in the (51:27 - 51:30)
island of armor (51:29 - 51:32)
if evolved into the Silurian slowking (51:30 - 51:34)
instead if a specific item can be found (51:32 - 51:38)
in the crown tundra base original (51:34 - 51:39)
slowpoke (51:38 - 51:43)
is it psychic or is it water psychic (51:39 - 51:46)
water no psychic water Oh cuz this is (51:43 - 51:49)
just psychic and I have to look it is (51:46 - 51:51)
water psychic and glaring a slowpoke is (51:49 - 51:52)
pure psychic (51:51 - 51:54)
it's just psychic regular slowpokes (51:52 - 51:57)
ability is oblivious or own tempo and (51:54 - 52:01)
goal Aryan slowpokes ability is gluttony (51:57 - 52:05)
or own tempo yeah canto slowpokes hidden (52:01 - 52:05)
ability (52:05 - 52:08)
is regenerator I guess we technically (52:05 - 52:11)
don't know if that would be the same it (52:08 - 52:14)
could be it could not be they've done (52:11 - 52:17)
yes the first thing so and we we do know (52:14 - 52:19)
that we don't know what valerian Slowbro (52:17 - 52:22)
Orgel area and Slowking look like they (52:19 - 52:25)
show kind of some of it in the trailer (52:22 - 52:28)
so Kings got a lot of eyes yeah we don't (52:25 - 52:29)
know what it's we don't know what its (52:28 - 52:31)
stats are we don't know its ability we (52:29 - 52:34)
don't know if like slow King becomes (52:31 - 52:36)
like a super fast Pokemon instead of a (52:34 - 52:38)
super slow like we do we just don't know (52:36 - 52:41)
there there are stat differences between (52:38 - 52:44)
like executor and a lowland executor (52:41 - 52:46)
hand Raichu and Rollo and write you and (52:44 - 52:49)
stuff so but that was that was cute it (52:46 - 52:51)
was so the game did get updated from (52:49 - 52:56)
version 1.0.0 to version 1.1 point 0 it (52:51 - 52:59)
did fix a there are no patch notes of (52:56 - 53:02)
course because it's a Nintendo game so (52:59 - 53:04)
we don't know exactly what was fixed I (53:02 - 53:05)
think people have already tested and (53:04 - 53:08)
there was a issue with sucker-punch in (53:05 - 53:10)
competitive we do know that that was (53:08 - 53:15)
fixed the all raid resetting moving the (53:10 - 53:18)
clock forward that was not fixed still (53:15 - 53:20)
to the state don't know if that could (53:18 - 53:23)
ever be fixed yeah with the updates of (53:20 - 53:25)
one point one point zero if you go to (53:23 - 53:27)
wet church and you have at least gotten (53:25 - 53:31)
to the wild area you will meet one of (53:27 - 53:33)
the new characters for a hot second and (53:31 - 53:36)
you will also be able to catch Glary and (53:33 - 53:38)
slowpoke you're curious and shiny (53:36 - 53:43)
hunting it you cannot get a shiny in the (53:38 - 53:45)
actual encounter but you can Masuda (53:43 - 53:49)
breed or just breed for a shiny did you (53:45 - 53:53)
ever get yours no I'm at like 600 oh (53:49 - 53:56)
there was a quick theory that maybe it (53:53 - 53:59)
was like boosted odds like the Magikarp (53:56 - 54:03)
event but I think when I think like it (53:59 - 54:06)
actually gave like a cool moment in in (54:03 - 54:07)
like the Pokemon community if you're (54:06 - 54:10)
active on I'm like dis cords or slacks (54:07 - 54:13)
or twitches twitch or whatever where (54:10 - 54:16)
everyone was hunting the same Pokemon so (54:13 - 54:18)
that was kind of cool it almost felt (54:16 - 54:21)
like a mini community day where everyone (54:18 - 54:24)
was breeding slowpoke together I don't (54:21 - 54:26)
think it's boosted at all I just think a (54:24 - 54:28)
couple people got (54:26 - 54:32)
very early and lucky and then said they (54:28 - 54:34)
got it very early and lucky but also (54:32 - 54:36)
everyone's hunting it at the same time (54:34 - 54:38)
so then people are like yeah well maybe (54:36 - 54:41)
I'll get it early and lucky it's not how (54:38 - 54:43)
odds work is this where we talk about (54:41 - 54:46)
the gigantic Mex designs yeah we can (54:43 - 54:47)
well yeah let's talk about the (54:46 - 54:49)
specifically the starters at least so we (54:47 - 54:52)
have Giganta max Rilla boom Jake hey (54:49 - 54:55)
it's max andreas Giganta max in Italian (54:52 - 54:57)
Rilla boom is the drummer Pokemon (54:55 - 55:00)
guerrilla booms tree stump drum has (54:57 - 55:02)
grown rapidly to the point that it now (55:00 - 55:04)
resembles a small forest on its own (55:02 - 55:06)
Giganta max marilla boom has merged with (55:04 - 55:08)
the forest of the drums to become even (55:06 - 55:11)
more powerful he can control it sticks (55:08 - 55:13)
as it was its own limbs and will (55:11 - 55:17)
demonstrate transcend transcendental (55:13 - 55:19)
transcendental drumming techniques (55:17 - 55:21)
Giganta max Rilla boom will completely (55:19 - 55:23)
focused on playing its drums compelled (55:21 - 55:25)
by the power of welling up inside the (55:23 - 55:28)
sound can reach across oceans and by and (55:25 - 55:31)
heard by those living in other regions (55:28 - 55:34)
it said that those who hear the beat (55:31 - 55:36)
will begin to dance uncontrollably (55:34 - 55:38)
overwhelmed by the rhythm that surges (55:36 - 55:41)
from inside them what a fitting tribute (55:38 - 55:48)
to Neil Peart yeah I mean I like this (55:41 - 55:51)
one although I think the like that I (55:48 - 55:53)
can't quite tell if it's it's hair (55:51 - 55:56)
growing out to hold drumsticks is that (55:53 - 55:59)
what everybody is that like oh wait (55:56 - 56:01)
everyone everybody sings honestly I (55:59 - 56:03)
didn't I guess I skipped over this the (56:01 - 56:05)
island of armor expansion will allow (56:03 - 56:07)
trainers to helps some of Pokemon (56:05 - 56:09)
traveling with them gain the ability to (56:07 - 56:12)
Giganta max well there you go question (56:09 - 56:14)
answered this has led to the discovery (56:12 - 56:16)
of Giganta max forms Rilla boom cinder (56:14 - 56:18)
ace and antalya and the evolutions of (56:16 - 56:19)
these three pokémon that trainers could (56:18 - 56:21)
choose as their first starter pokemon in (56:19 - 56:22)
the gallery agent I feel like that (56:21 - 56:25)
definitely hit there's the question yeah (56:22 - 56:26)
that'd probably ask you the question yes (56:25 - 56:29)
all right cinder ace the burning ball at (56:26 - 56:31)
cinder aces feed has grown to massive (56:29 - 56:33)
proportions things to Giganta max energy (56:31 - 56:36)
if Giganta max and race kicks the ball (56:33 - 56:38)
using its well honed techniques the (56:36 - 56:41)
fighting spirit will possess the ball (56:38 - 56:42)
and call (56:41 - 56:44)
the ball to pursue opponents as it has a (56:42 - 56:46)
mind of its own giganto max and rays (56:44 - 56:48)
most incredible leg strength in fact its (56:46 - 56:51)
legs are said to rank among the (56:48 - 56:53)
strongest of all Pokemon even without (56:51 - 56:56)
its even without its gigantic pyro ball (56:53 - 56:58)
it can deliver powerful kicks kicking (56:56 - 57:00)
moves that overwhelm other Dynomax (56:58 - 57:03)
Pokemon so cinder ace is now on a final (57:00 - 57:05)
fantasy bomb find the fantasy Pokemon (57:03 - 57:07)
crossover confirmed prior fighting game (57:05 - 57:13)
firmed 2021 when Pokemon shows up in the (57:07 - 57:18)
final fantasy MMO it looks like a bomb (57:13 - 57:20)
it just look like yeah it does look like (57:18 - 57:23)
the bomb from Final Fantasy like a lot (57:20 - 57:27)
and finally in telly on and tele it has (57:23 - 57:29)
gained an extremely long tail thanks to (57:27 - 57:32)
Giganta maxing its tail length is said (57:29 - 57:34)
to be over a hundred and thirty feet (57:32 - 57:36)
while Giganta max intelli on will (57:34 - 57:38)
stretch out its long tail and hold it (57:36 - 57:41)
straight to form a pillar and intelli on (57:38 - 57:42)
will take battle on top of that position (57:41 - 57:45)
we'll take a battle position at the top (57:42 - 57:47)
this Pokemon has an incredibly sharp (57:45 - 57:50)
mind and calculated with the precise (57:47 - 57:52)
effects that gravity will have on the (57:50 - 57:54)
trajectory of its shots enabling it to (57:52 - 57:58)
be an extremely effective sniper Italian (57:54 - 58:00)
has hidden tools within its body and (57:58 - 58:03)
they have these and these have been (58:00 - 58:07)
enhanced due to Giganta max dictating (58:03 - 58:11)
membranes on a sure she's they're big (58:07 - 58:14)
words jeez this is a game for ten years (58:11 - 58:18)
old Pokemon that's like kids biology (58:14 - 58:22)
nictitating dictating what the okay (58:18 - 58:24)
break it down what does that mean (58:22 - 58:26)
give me the science Greg no it's (58:24 - 58:28)
actually spelled nictitating yeah it's (58:26 - 58:32)
belt weird but that's how you spell like (58:28 - 58:36)
it not the blink yeah so the NIC tating (58:32 - 58:42)
membrane like dogs have it and most (58:36 - 58:44)
lizards have it is that is the third (58:42 - 58:47)
eyelid that's translucent so they blink (58:44 - 58:50)
while keeping their eyes open sorry oka (58:47 - 58:52)
so it's a nictitating membrane is (58:50 - 58:54)
see-through remembering that's like an (58:52 - 58:56)
eyelid how they can remote (58:54 - 58:58)
in their eyes while still maintaining (58:56 - 59:03)
vision it's seen a lot in fish reptiles (58:58 - 59:08)
birds humans and primates don't have it (59:03 - 59:11)
camels polar bear seals a lot of things (59:08 - 59:12)
have a nictitating membrane is basically (59:11 - 59:15)
for Austin's purposes most people just (59:12 - 59:17)
call it the third eyelid hmm we're used (59:15 - 59:19)
to them when they close their eyes but (59:17 - 59:20)
the nictitating membrane allows them to (59:19 - 59:24)
continue seeing while moistening their (59:20 - 59:26)
eyeballs while this now lets in telling (59:24 - 59:28)
detect temperature air pressure and (59:26 - 59:30)
humidity and tally Anna's a skilled (59:28 - 59:31)
sniper as well (59:30 - 59:33)
easily hitting a berry that is rollin (59:31 - 59:37)
over rollin around over nine miles away (59:33 - 59:40)
I thought the rifle was a good idea yeah (59:37 - 59:44)
I didn't want to say it but if we were (59:40 - 59:46)
thinking of these as like highschool (59:44 - 59:50)
clique troops it has suddenly become bad (59:46 - 59:52)
I (59:50 - 59:55)
I have I am uncomfortable with the rifle (59:52 - 59:58)
I know is it more like a spear gun than (59:55 - 60:01)
a rifle okay no it's it's a sniper right (59:58 - 60:04)
in it so there's no such thing like (60:01 - 60:05)
people have been trying to watch it's a (60:04 - 60:08)
water harpoon there's no water harpoon (60:05 - 60:11)
perch water harpoons are used in the (60:08 - 60:14)
water not from a sniper's perch (60:11 - 60:17)
you also don't say Oh remember James (60:14 - 60:22)
Bond and his water harpoon I mean it's a (60:17 - 60:24)
secret agent Pokemon it's a sniper rifle (60:22 - 60:26)
it they keep talking about him being a (60:24 - 60:28)
sniper yeah I mean they're never going (60:26 - 60:29)
to say rifle and they're never going to (60:28 - 60:32)
say it God and they will probably stay (60:29 - 60:35)
say sniper it's a little uncomfortable I (60:32 - 60:38)
think the optics are real bad on check (60:35 - 60:40)
antem accent le on yeah just really are (60:38 - 60:44)
the optics it just it looks like I (60:40 - 60:46)
didn't want to say school shooter but it (60:44 - 60:48)
looks like a school shooter like you (60:46 - 60:50)
have the jock whose cinder ace you have (60:48 - 60:53)
the musician that's what's his name (60:50 - 60:55)
monkey boo dude oh and then you have (60:53 - 60:57)
this the shooter people were pushing the (60:55 - 61:00)
school angle for this really hard yes we (60:57 - 61:03)
we were on a set on this podcast we (61:00 - 61:06)
talked about the school angle and like (61:03 - 61:09)
this this addition just makes it look (61:06 - 61:12)
bad the outlooks are that the objects (61:09 - 61:18)
are bad I'm I'm I like I mean I'm glad (61:12 - 61:21)
they're getting Giganta maxes but this (61:18 - 61:23)
one just really (61:21 - 61:27)
this one really makes me uneasy just it (61:23 - 61:30)
could look better in game somehow I (61:27 - 61:34)
don't know how but I I just wish they (61:30 - 61:37)
had gone a different route I can't say (61:34 - 61:41)
that I disagree in any way I this (61:37 - 61:45)
honestly just anything non gun based (61:41 - 61:47)
would have been much better and the (61:45 - 61:49)
other ones are so fantasy like like a (61:47 - 61:52)
giant drum set in a big soccer ball when (61:49 - 61:54)
you set up those two things of realism (61:52 - 61:56)
like it's a big drum kit and it works (61:54 - 61:57)
like a drum kit (61:56 - 61:59)
it's a real big soccer ball and it works (61:57 - 62:01)
like a soccer ball with an intelligence (61:59 - 62:04)
in it it's an ice gun okay so putting (62:01 - 62:08)
aside the whole school theme I am more (62:04 - 62:12)
surprised that they were willing to give (62:08 - 62:14)
a Pokemon something that looks like a (62:12 - 62:19)
gun because in space world demo for gold (62:14 - 62:23)
and silver remoraid and octillery looked (62:19 - 62:26)
more like a gun in a tank and they (62:23 - 62:28)
changed that so then they check they've (62:26 - 62:31)
had these conversations before clearly (62:28 - 62:34)
you can assume well I don't know we can (62:31 - 62:35)
talk about this forever (62:34 - 62:37)
I think you know two things are gonna (62:35 - 62:41)
happen either no one like this will this (62:37 - 62:42)
will be a non-issue the game will come (62:41 - 62:44)
out people have already made their jokes (62:42 - 62:48)
about Italian everyone moves on or when (62:44 - 62:52)
the DLC actually drops and if for (62:48 - 62:54)
whatever reason any parents want to (62:52 - 62:56)
latch on to this they will specifically (62:54 - 62:58)
latch on to each other so I can see like (62:56 - 63:00)
I can see it going two ways either no (62:58 - 63:02)
one's going to care when this comes out (63:00 - 63:05)
and for the most part this yeah I think (63:02 - 63:07)
I think overall it's it's as it's (63:05 - 63:09)
harmless like I think jinx is pretty (63:07 - 63:10)
harmless at this point even though it (63:09 - 63:13)
has bad history or some parent will hold (63:10 - 63:15)
on to this and they will use this as (63:13 - 63:18)
Pokemon is the devil and it's corrupting (63:15 - 63:20)
our children and looking to happen no (63:18 - 63:23)
matter what I mean it is I mean there's (63:20 - 63:26)
any people who are upset about it I (63:23 - 63:28)
ultimately is like I don't hate the (63:26 - 63:30)
design I think it's you know it fits (63:28 - 63:33)
well with the theme I just think if they (63:30 - 63:37)
wanted to avoid controversy at all (63:33 - 63:39)
they would have picked a different (63:37 - 63:41)
direction yeah like this is just (63:39 - 63:44)
courting controversy like whether you (63:41 - 63:45)
think it's harmless or not whether you (63:44 - 63:48)
think it's a water harpoon or not the (63:45 - 63:51)
fact that we have the conversation is a (63:48 - 63:53)
conversation that I don't think they (63:51 - 63:55)
necessarily want people having about (63:53 - 63:58)
their content and their design at (63:55 - 63:59)
minimum there will be 32 memes made (63:58 - 64:01)
about this certain of which will (63:59 - 64:03)
actually be funny yeah I mean like (64:01 - 64:06)
you're you started one so I already have (64:03 - 64:07)
my joke on Twitter that came from my (64:06 - 64:10)
husband and and and we like the three of (64:07 - 64:12)
us who are very deep into Pokemon lore (64:10 - 64:14)
week we can we can find pokedex entries (64:12 - 64:17)
that are very dark and very grim oh yes (64:14 - 64:18)
my parents aren't looking for that (64:17 - 64:20)
they're looking for a screenshot of look (64:18 - 64:24)
at this Pokemon with like right right (64:20 - 64:27)
well those are the three Giganta max yep (64:24 - 64:29)
a couple things here I'm going to read (64:27 - 64:32)
this next part and then uh well this is (64:29 - 64:36)
theirs mmm all right more past Pokemon (64:32 - 64:38)
available to obtain in pokemon sword and (64:36 - 64:40)
shield many pokemon that didn't appear (64:38 - 64:42)
in pokemon sword and shield make their (64:40 - 64:44)
homes on the island of armor or the (64:42 - 64:47)
crowned tundra trainers will meet lively (64:44 - 64:49)
array of diverse pokemon from newly (64:47 - 64:52)
discovered legendary pokemon and new (64:49 - 64:56)
regional forms too familiar pokemon that (64:52 - 64:57)
have been seen living in other regions (64:56 - 65:00)
free updates are planned for pokemon (64:57 - 65:02)
sword and shield to coincide with the (65:00 - 65:05)
release of these expansions updates are (65:02 - 65:07)
scheduled as the same day of the island (65:05 - 65:10)
are an armor and crown tundra expansions (65:07 - 65:12)
are released each update will enable (65:10 - 65:14)
players who have not purchased the (65:12 - 65:17)
expansion past to receive the pokemon (65:14 - 65:20)
via the island of armor and Crown tundra (65:17 - 65:23)
expansions through means such as trading (65:20 - 65:26)
players will also be able to bring over (65:23 - 65:28)
past Pokemon to games from the cloud (65:26 - 65:30)
service Pokemon home scheduled to (65:28 - 65:33)
release in February 2020 as long as (65:30 - 65:35)
those Pokemon appear in the island of (65:33 - 65:39)
armor and Crown tundra and just to get (65:35 - 65:42)
this out of the way new outfits fans (65:39 - 65:43)
will be able to obtain a special (65:42 - 65:45)
training uniform in the island of armor (65:43 - 65:48)
in the crown tundra trainers can Don (65:45 - 65:50)
exploration gear preparing themselves (65:48 - 65:51)
for researching and (65:50 - 65:54)
trading destinations the tundra holds (65:51 - 65:56)
they might find a strange temple where (65:54 - 65:59)
at least to expect it or a mysterious (65:56 - 66:01)
giant tree growing in a place that it (65:59 - 66:04)
doesn't belong new outfits seems that (66:01 - 66:06)
new hair is also being added it looks (66:04 - 66:09)
like you can have roses hair that is (66:06 - 66:10)
really exciting that was actually one of (66:09 - 66:12)
my complaints is while I do like the (66:10 - 66:14)
character customization in this game I (66:12 - 66:16)
felt like a lot of people were (66:14 - 66:18)
gravitating towards a set of clothes (66:16 - 66:21)
that looked really cool or the better (66:18 - 66:24)
hairstyles it seems that there are (66:21 - 66:26)
they're adding some new hair and some (66:24 - 66:28)
new clothes which is nice (66:26 - 66:33)
going back to new Pokemon I think they (66:28 - 66:36)
said a hundred new Pokemon for crown (66:33 - 66:38)
Tundra and then a hundred new Pokemon (66:36 - 66:43)
for armor so that's G hundred and fifty (66:38 - 66:48)
one hundred for sure nice hmm I hear (66:43 - 66:50)
some compliance Greg (66:48 - 66:51)
[Music] (66:50 - 66:54)
Gregg and I certainly don't look at this (66:51 - 66:55)
in the same way nope (66:54 - 66:59)
so my okay my problem with this yes it (66:55 - 67:02)
underline it undermines the arguments (66:59 - 67:06)
that they were making for limiting the (67:02 - 67:08)
decks in the first place the idea that (67:06 - 67:09)
they were carefully picking ones for (67:08 - 67:11)
that region and they were doing it for (67:09 - 67:13)
competitive reasons like if they were (67:11 - 67:15)
really doing it for competitive reasons (67:13 - 67:17)
there's not enough time to see what the (67:15 - 67:20)
current competition is like without (67:17 - 67:23)
adding in more like this is coming in (67:20 - 67:25)
six months and there's no way they've (67:23 - 67:27)
analyzed all that it I've figured out (67:25 - 67:29)
what the new meta is and then decided (67:27 - 67:31)
that these ones are gonna help balance (67:29 - 67:35)
that out so it undermines that it feels (67:31 - 67:39)
like a like they're capitulating to the (67:35 - 67:41)
national deck ters on some level like (67:39 - 67:43)
you know I don't agree to that at that (67:41 - 67:47)
point but go on like hey we are adding (67:43 - 67:49)
these back tada like they said they (67:47 - 67:53)
weren't and then here we are so there's (67:49 - 67:56)
no way to have done this whether they (67:53 - 68:00)
meant it or not without giving fuel to (67:56 - 68:02)
those arguments which average problem (68:00 - 68:05)
with me being the bitter person that I (68:02 - 68:07)
am I would have net like I would have (68:05 - 68:09)
never get I would released a third with (68:07 - 68:12)
no new Pokemon like maybe one we're pull (68:09 - 68:14)
some but I don't I don't know if you can (68:12 - 68:15)
do that (68:14 - 68:18)
check out it so I guess I hate you (68:15 - 68:20)
because you were all nasty low did you (68:18 - 68:22)
see that I got the party hat Wurmple and (68:20 - 68:23)
yet you guys do you know I have no that (68:22 - 68:26)
I certainly did I have not gotten it yet (68:23 - 68:30)
they didn't specifically say in the the (68:26 - 68:33)
direct that normally we do a third (68:30 - 68:36)
version and that this content replaces (68:33 - 68:41)
the third version so in the history of (68:36 - 68:44)
third versions every third version has (68:41 - 68:46)
always added more Pokemon than the game (68:44 - 68:49)
before true so I don't see it any (68:46 - 68:52)
different in that sense I see it the (68:49 - 68:54)
reason why I see it different is this is (68:52 - 68:58)
a different product so usually when (68:54 - 68:59)
there's a third version it's a year year (68:58 - 69:02)
and a half later they hundred sixty-four (68:59 - 69:05)
days if it's ultra Center mood (69:02 - 69:07)
they have changed up the story some they (69:05 - 69:09)
have added remove things and you're (69:07 - 69:11)
getting a full cut you're getting the (69:09 - 69:13)
game again with additions and as a (69:11 - 69:15)
person that likes a lot of the Third's (69:13 - 69:16)
who often thought a lot of the third (69:15 - 69:18)
versions were a lot better than the (69:16 - 69:20)
first version yeah we don't know what (69:18 - 69:22)
we're we don't know what we're getting (69:20 - 69:23)
that's true (69:22 - 69:25)
everybody's like oh the DLCs will be (69:23 - 69:27)
great and it'll be all this great (69:25 - 69:28)
content like we don't know that we don't (69:27 - 69:30)
know that we're getting more storyline (69:28 - 69:32)
we don't know we don't know what we're (69:30 - 69:34)
getting we don't know that these are (69:32 - 69:37)
going to bring actual value we knew (69:34 - 69:39)
they're gonna add them in adding them in (69:37 - 69:42)
this quickly just sort of undermines a (69:39 - 69:44)
lot of the message that they were giving (69:42 - 69:47)
going into and dealing with that massive (69:44 - 69:51)
ugly movement and I feel like it really (69:47 - 69:55)
gives a lot more power to their (69:51 - 69:58)
arguments which is really unfortunate (69:55 - 70:00)
and I I don't like it that way I also (69:58 - 70:04)
have I'm very concerned when any large (70:00 - 70:07)
triple-a company starts doing DLC (70:04 - 70:11)
because we already feel like games come (70:07 - 70:13)
out weighted quickly and if DLC is a (70:11 - 70:16)
very acceptable way it's a lot of games (70:13 - 70:20)
now put out games that are maybe 3/4 (70:16 - 70:22)
done and they're just gonna patch it in (70:20 - 70:24)
add that content in with the DLC because (70:22 - 70:27)
that's now expected and I don't think (70:24 - 70:30)
that that's a good step that any company (70:27 - 70:35)
has taken and I'm hoping this DLC will (70:30 - 70:37)
be very worth it that it will feel like (70:35 - 70:39)
you're getting a bunch of news story and (70:37 - 70:40)
a bunch new content and there's a lot to (70:39 - 70:44)
do and it doesn't feel like hey we added (70:40 - 70:46)
a new battle tower and we needed a way (70:44 - 70:49)
to shove in more Pokemon and here you go (70:46 - 70:52)
so we don't have a great history with (70:49 - 70:55)
dlc dlc often for a lot of game starts (70:52 - 70:57)
out really strong and then just gets (70:55 - 70:59)
worse and worse and worse because it's (70:57 - 71:02)
seen as a way to sell a half-baked game (70:59 - 71:04)
at full price that you'll patch later (71:02 - 71:07)
with dlc and i don't have any evidence (71:04 - 71:09)
that this will happen here but it has (71:07 - 71:11)
happened before so when a company makes (71:09 - 71:15)
the change to dlc i get concerned (71:11 - 71:17)
get concerned about what their future (71:15 - 71:20)
plans are I get concerned about their (71:17 - 71:22)
willingness because all corporations try (71:20 - 71:24)
to do things faster and a certain (71:22 - 71:26)
timeframe and if they can put out a (71:24 - 71:29)
smaller game every seven months and then (71:26 - 71:31)
bring out an expansion six months after (71:29 - 71:35)
that like it's a weird cycle to have (71:31 - 71:38)
started so this change away from getting (71:35 - 71:41)
a full baked third game to we're gonna (71:38 - 71:43)
start patching things in if you didn't (71:41 - 71:45)
like third version games great this is (71:43 - 71:48)
great for you but we don't I don't have (71:45 - 71:51)
proof that this is going to be worth (71:48 - 71:54)
that big of a change and there's a lot (71:51 - 71:56)
of troubling signs around DLCs all I (71:54 - 71:58)
want to say yes (71:56 - 72:03)
number one Volcarona is back so that (71:58 - 72:04)
shiny bug team I've been working on for (72:03 - 72:07)
the past two years is back complete (72:04 - 72:10)
again and number two I mean I don't see (72:07 - 72:13)
it as capitulation I'm sure that this (72:10 - 72:17)
DLC has been planned and in progress for (72:13 - 72:20)
a long long time and we're still not (72:17 - 72:23)
getting a full 800 I also disagree that (72:20 - 72:27)
they are they're not gonna you know be (72:23 - 72:30)
able to see the meta they can tweak the (72:27 - 72:34)
stats on different pokemons pretty close (72:30 - 72:36)
up to til the last minute you know if (72:34 - 72:37)
they just need to make something a (72:36 - 72:39)
little more powerful to help balance (72:37 - 72:40)
things out and everything like that I (72:39 - 72:42)
think they've got some leeway but we (72:40 - 72:45)
just using meta we just got Giganta max (72:42 - 72:48)
in the new BGC like we are still they're (72:45 - 72:51)
still working through what they did in (72:48 - 72:54)
the game proper and this comes out in (72:51 - 72:55)
June yeah (72:54 - 72:58)
okay so it's like the the VGC part they (72:55 - 73:03)
are only allowing a specific only Jarek (72:58 - 73:05)
Giganta max Pokemon that have been (73:03 - 73:08)
promoted or allowed yeah and we just got (73:05 - 73:11)
a new wave of promoted they and those (73:08 - 73:13)
promoted will probably be ready for (73:11 - 73:16)
season 3 which is really fast already so (73:13 - 73:18)
season 1 was no Giganta max season or (73:16 - 73:20)
season yeah season 1 was no Giganta max (73:18 - 73:23)
it ended December 31st season 2 started (73:20 - 73:26)
June 3rd and gigantic max Pokemon are (73:23 - 73:28)
allowed and I will tell you right now is (73:26 - 73:30)
somebody who did 80 plus battle (73:28 - 73:34)
in ranked in doubles in season 1 season (73:30 - 73:37)
2 is very different I have done 20 (73:34 - 73:40)
battles right now and I have as somebody (73:37 - 73:42)
who went I think it was like I had like (73:40 - 73:45)
43 wins and like 35 losses and I made (73:42 - 73:48)
its master ball pretty easily I can't (73:45 - 73:50)
win a single match with the same team I (73:48 - 73:53)
used in season one because that meted (73:50 - 73:56)
knew that meta shifted so fast and it's (73:53 - 73:58)
going to shift again one season three (73:56 - 74:00)
starts which will be February and then (73:58 - 74:03)
season four in March (74:00 - 74:06)
III think that's a good thing to have (74:03 - 74:10)
because in past Pokemon games it was (74:06 - 74:12)
always well this is Landorus this is (74:10 - 74:16)
Cresselia this is primal Groudon this is (74:12 - 74:18)
primal Kyogre and these have to be on (74:16 - 74:21)
your team and it doesn't seem with the (74:18 - 74:23)
exception of drag a pole it doesn't seem (74:21 - 74:26)
like there is one specific Pokemon so if (74:23 - 74:30)
their goal is to just keep changing it I (74:26 - 74:32)
think that's fine I think you're right (74:30 - 74:34)
of maybe like six months is not enough (74:32 - 74:38)
time to do that but I but it's we don't (74:34 - 74:39)
know we like we don't even know what the (74:38 - 74:41)
stats are for Slowking so if if they (74:39 - 74:44)
wanted to boost slow Kings stats like up (74:41 - 74:47)
ten because they see that there is a (74:44 - 74:51)
dominance in fast poison Pokemon and (74:47 - 74:52)
they think that slow King would be a (74:51 - 74:54)
good counter they can do that without us (74:52 - 74:56)
ever knowing that they change those (74:54 - 74:58)
stats before June comes I guess (74:56 - 75:00)
technically Slowking is hundred nuts (74:58 - 75:03)
Tedra yeah I mean they could it just it (75:00 - 75:06)
it seems to undermined that message a (75:03 - 75:10)
lot and I I don't know they've there are (75:06 - 75:11)
so many more people in competitive this (75:10 - 75:13)
time around and like they're really (75:11 - 75:16)
you're negative means more more that you (75:13 - 75:18)
have to look at like having more people (75:16 - 75:20)
run it just means there's a lot more (75:18 - 75:21)
data that you have to go through it (75:20 - 75:23)
doesn't cut the time down but that (75:21 - 75:25)
doesn't necessarily that doesn't (75:23 - 75:26)
necessarily mean that they have a team (75:25 - 75:28)
dedicated to that and that all they're (75:26 - 75:30)
doing is looking at that kind of stuff (75:28 - 75:32)
like I am assuming and Pokemon they (75:30 - 75:34)
haven't really no dedicated team to it (75:32 - 75:35)
then it takes even longer (75:34 - 75:37)
yeah but I'm assuming that the Pokemon (75:35 - 75:39)
they promoted this time around they (75:37 - 75:41)
promoted it with the reason to counter (75:39 - 75:43)
things in again this is all (75:41 - 75:47)
speculation but they promoted Lapras (75:43 - 75:52)
colossal apple and elk Remy and there (75:47 - 75:56)
was zero alchemy and there was zero flap (75:52 - 76:01)
'el in season one and there are some (75:56 - 76:04)
Appleton and some elk Remy I am now (76:01 - 76:06)
seeing in season two and now that (76:04 - 76:09)
they've promoted those Pokemon the GMAX (76:06 - 76:11)
form of alchemy and the GMAX form of (76:09 - 76:13)
flap will / Appleton will be available (76:11 - 76:16)
probably in season 3 maybe that's a (76:13 - 76:20)
coincidence I don't know but it seems to (76:16 - 76:22)
be it seems to be lining up pretty like (76:20 - 76:24)
I feel like they've picked those (76:22 - 76:27)
promoted Pokemon because they saw what (76:24 - 76:29)
was perm they saw what was being used in (76:27 - 76:32)
season 1 and now they are preparing for (76:29 - 76:36)
season 3 hmm maybe I don't know but they (76:32 - 76:38)
did do what they said they were going to (76:36 - 76:41)
do which is focus on competitive and (76:38 - 76:44)
even the base changes of you can't (76:41 - 76:47)
flinch Giganta max pokemon we're adding (76:44 - 76:49)
room service for the amount of trick (76:47 - 76:53)
room teams we see they added you know (76:49 - 76:54)
wheezing which everyone thought was (76:53 - 76:56)
gonna be really good but no one's using (76:54 - 76:58)
right now to like disable abilities I (76:56 - 77:01)
still think that a hundred Pokemon is (76:58 - 77:03)
yes a hundred Pokemon in June and the (77:01 - 77:06)
number 100 Pokemon in November is (77:03 - 77:08)
definitely adding more complexity to (77:06 - 77:10)
that and then I mean and they're (77:08 - 77:14)
bringing back huge ones they're like (77:10 - 77:17)
ones that dominated before yeah yeah now (77:14 - 77:18)
the problem right now is they showed (77:17 - 77:21)
Landorus they showed blenders they (77:18 - 77:23)
showed that's the somatic gross they (77:21 - 77:26)
showed Garchomp but there but but and (77:23 - 77:28)
we're assuming that round Tundra brings (77:26 - 77:30)
back a bunch of the legendaries like (77:28 - 77:31)
we're assuming that they're bringing (77:30 - 77:33)
that like once Jun comes like those (77:31 - 77:35)
Pokemon probably won't be available for (77:33 - 77:37)
battle until August because they said (77:35 - 77:39)
end of June which means they probably (77:37 - 77:41)
aren't going to start that season there (77:39 - 77:43)
there's no way if if it comes out like (77:41 - 77:46)
June 20th and the games only out for 10 (77:43 - 77:48)
days I can't see them saying like these (77:46 - 77:49)
100 pokemon are going to be available (77:48 - 77:50)
July 1st (77:49 - 77:51)
I think that's soonest they would be (77:50 - 77:53)
available August 1st so then at that (77:51 - 77:56)
point you have 10 months of this game (77:53 - 77:57)
existing (77:56 - 78:00)
in a meta before adding a hundred new (77:57 - 78:02)
Pokemon and I think that's pretty I (78:00 - 78:03)
think that's fair I think that's fine I (78:02 - 78:06)
don't know that it's fine like they I (78:03 - 78:07)
don't know that because they've taken (78:06 - 78:10)
out so many moves they restricted a lot (78:07 - 78:13)
of things I I don't know that this (78:10 - 78:19)
timeframe is enough to with all the (78:13 - 78:21)
changes with all of the GMAX with all (78:19 - 78:22)
the moves different with all the new (78:21 - 78:25)
abilities there are so many moving parts (78:22 - 78:28)
I don't know that ten months is enough I (78:25 - 78:31)
think ten months is more than enough if (78:28 - 78:33)
you look at competitive games like apex (78:31 - 78:35)
or fortnight where they're changing (78:33 - 78:38)
things if not once a month every two (78:35 - 78:39)
weeks (78:38 - 78:42)
yeah but they but those are like these (78:39 - 78:45)
are set once something's in this game (78:42 - 78:46)
like a bug was in this game they've not (78:45 - 78:48)
ever changed it the stats in the middle (78:46 - 78:51)
of the game that's programmed in is that (78:48 - 78:54)
it's in they call those up they they hmm (78:51 - 78:58)
right you can they can I don't know that (78:54 - 78:59)
they will I mean seven years ago Masuda (78:58 - 79:01)
said they were never gonna do dlc and (78:59 - 79:03)
that was something we've already always (79:01 - 79:05)
brought up on the podcast of like this (79:03 - 79:08)
is right like I guess I believe the dude (79:05 - 79:10)
who's in charge of Pokemon to say (79:08 - 79:11)
they're never gonna do DLC and now (79:10 - 79:15)
they've done DLC so I like with (79:11 - 79:18)
competitive games you have to this is (79:15 - 79:19)
just a general thought I feel like with (79:18 - 79:21)
all competitive games you have to make (79:19 - 79:25)
changes to keep competitive fresh and I (79:21 - 79:28)
don't think what was working before of (79:25 - 79:31)
not changing anything whether that's (79:28 - 79:34)
adding or removing Pokemon is is good (79:31 - 79:36)
enough to keep people's interests I mean (79:34 - 79:37)
if you look at the Pokemon Trading Card (79:36 - 79:39)
Game they change it every three months (79:37 - 79:41)
yeah but you also have to pay every (79:39 - 79:45)
three months yes as much of a cash grab (79:41 - 79:48)
trading card game is significantly more (79:45 - 79:52)
successful than the BGC you all true you (79:48 - 79:53)
always have more people playing the card (79:52 - 79:55)
game and they're changing that every (79:53 - 79:57)
three months and for whatever reason (79:55 - 79:59)
they have these two weird formats where (79:57 - 80:00)
Japan is playing at ahead of time then (79:59 - 80:04)
yeah it's just they can just straight up (80:00 - 80:07)
and Pokemon like if Drago pol is too (80:04 - 80:09)
powerful nothing is stopping them from (80:07 - 80:10)
banning it yeah (80:09 - 80:13)
have they done that before no but that (80:10 - 80:15)
doesn't mean they can't it's also like (80:13 - 80:17)
not a great experience and then one (80:15 - 80:18)
thing I do know about the competitive (80:17 - 80:20)
Pokemon company is I don't think any of (80:18 - 80:22)
them like Landers no but they're (80:20 - 80:24)
bringing it back yeah it's going to be (80:22 - 80:26)
an incredibly nerfed Landorus yeah I (80:24 - 80:29)
mean the staff could be different I mean (80:26 - 80:33)
we know again my issue is there's a lot (80:29 - 80:35)
that we just don't know and there's a (80:33 - 80:38)
lot of signs that worry me (80:35 - 80:39)
and everybody who's yelling at me on (80:38 - 80:41)
Twitter like this is the greatest thing (80:39 - 80:42)
since sliced bread great I'm glad that (80:41 - 80:46)
you're excited I will be excited once (80:42 - 80:48)
I'm there but there's enough here to (80:46 - 80:50)
cause me (80:48 - 80:54)
pause that said I bought it all like him (80:50 - 80:56)
I bought it I've already paid my money (80:54 - 80:58)
because I'm going to see if it's worth (80:56 - 81:02)
it and I'm hoping I don't get burned and (80:58 - 81:04)
I'm hoping it doesn't set up a bad (81:02 - 81:06)
precedent for the future like I'm (81:04 - 81:10)
banking on past history of a lot of (81:06 - 81:13)
companies not coming true here I will (81:10 - 81:14)
say I don't know if this is the best (81:13 - 81:19)
solution for gamefreak but I am very (81:14 - 81:21)
excited that they are trying it if they (81:19 - 81:23)
try it and fail at least we can say we (81:21 - 81:26)
tried it but you know to to like lie to (81:23 - 81:30)
ourselves of being like Lake dlc for (81:26 - 81:33)
pokemon games were rampant around gen 5 (81:30 - 81:37)
and Gen 6 and gen 7 every single time (81:33 - 81:39)
Pokemon fans were like this is going to (81:37 - 81:41)
be the game that gets DLC and those were (81:39 - 81:44)
never the games that got DLC like don't (81:41 - 81:45)
like the Pokemon community can't pretend (81:44 - 81:47)
to themselves that that like they didn't (81:45 - 81:51)
want DLC for the last 10 plus years yeah (81:47 - 81:54)
but what they think they're getting and (81:51 - 81:55)
what they actually get it could be (81:54 - 81:58)
vastly different things like oh this is (81:55 - 82:00)
always that's always the case with (81:58 - 82:02)
playing games it's one by one it's also (82:00 - 82:04)
the case with DLC like there's been a (82:02 - 82:08)
ton of DLC that is runed games like you (82:04 - 82:11)
may want it but are you sure like the (82:08 - 82:14)
history of DLC 8 ain't great so a couple (82:11 - 82:17)
things I want to go back to the adding (82:14 - 82:19)
the Pokemon they did say that the (82:17 - 82:21)
Pokemon you get in this game or the (82:19 - 82:25)
Pokemon you get in this game I don't (82:21 - 82:27)
think this is like some weird loophole (82:25 - 82:31)
that they did because to add more (82:27 - 82:33)
Pokemon because one I don't think you (82:31 - 82:37)
can add a new area of a Pokemon game (82:33 - 82:41)
with a slight new story without adding (82:37 - 82:45)
more Pokemon if this was here's a new (82:41 - 82:47)
area with the same MO Pokemon and we're (82:45 - 82:50)
going to add a battle dojo that would (82:47 - 82:52)
probably not appeal to me because there (82:50 - 82:54)
is a certain set of the Pokemon audience (82:52 - 82:56)
that want to catch and discover new (82:54 - 82:58)
Pokemon even if those are Pokemon (82:56 - 83:00)
they've already caught before that's why (82:58 - 83:02)
when people go through you know X&Y or (83:00 - 83:04)
Sun and Moon they will (83:02 - 83:06)
catch the Pokemon over again because (83:04 - 83:09)
they enjoy catching and discovering and (83:06 - 83:11)
finding Pokemon and then there's a (83:09 - 83:12)
certain set of people that don't want to (83:11 - 83:14)
do that and they will wait till Pokemon (83:12 - 83:16)
home comes out and they will drag and (83:14 - 83:17)
drop all their Pokemon over to can (83:16 - 83:18)
instantly complete their pokedex and (83:17 - 83:24)
they were fine but I don't think that (83:18 - 83:26)
they could have done this without adding (83:24 - 83:28)
new Pokemon now I don't think that this (83:26 - 83:31)
was a pivot to national Dexter's I think (83:28 - 83:32)
that this was always planned the let's (83:31 - 83:33)
go team (83:32 - 83:37)
finished their game over a year ago this (83:33 - 83:40)
game came out what is that team working (83:37 - 83:42)
on was that team working on this was it (83:40 - 83:44)
not I'm assuming it was like all hands (83:42 - 83:46)
on deck for sword and shield when sword (83:44 - 83:50)
when they did finish let's go there's (83:46 - 83:52)
like so many thoughts too because like I (83:50 - 83:54)
mean whether they meant it or not is (83:52 - 83:56)
still it still slightly comes across (83:54 - 84:00)
that way sure like but during that (83:56 - 84:02)
during that entire time during that (84:00 - 84:03)
entire time when they were getting those (84:02 - 84:04)
lead up when they kept saying what you (84:03 - 84:08)
get is what you get yeah gave no hint or (84:04 - 84:11)
anything like we are gonna add things (84:08 - 84:13)
later we're gonna expand this game if (84:11 - 84:15)
they were working on at that time there (84:13 - 84:18)
they could have stopped so much of that (84:15 - 84:21)
controversy by saying we do have plans (84:18 - 84:23)
to deal with this in the future but (84:21 - 84:25)
we're not gonna tell you what that is do (84:23 - 84:28)
you think the likes by announcing the (84:25 - 84:30)
problem is like announcing this and (84:28 - 84:31)
seeing the people that are excited the (84:30 - 84:33)
people that are excited are excited (84:31 - 84:35)
because they love sword and shield the (84:33 - 84:37)
people that were against this game the (84:35 - 84:39)
National deck sirs while they while they (84:37 - 84:42)
started off being upset because not all (84:39 - 84:45)
the Pokemon were there these were the (84:42 - 84:47)
same people that got mad when you (84:45 - 84:49)
climbed a ladder the Pokemon stopped (84:47 - 84:51)
moving these were the same people that (84:49 - 84:54)
got mad that they didn't believe that (84:51 - 84:56)
the title screen was good enough (84:54 - 84:59)
compared to last Pokemon games those (84:56 - 85:01)
people are out of their minds so to like (84:59 - 85:04)
say that swords and shields coming (85:01 - 85:06)
there's 400 Pokemon we might add Pokemon (85:04 - 85:08)
later that would have never satisfied (85:06 - 85:12)
them well we don't well so a lot of the (85:08 - 85:15)
hyper focus on all the details was to (85:12 - 85:18)
underline their starting disappointment (85:15 - 85:19)
so when you started with the (85:18 - 85:21)
disappointment that you didn't at all (85:19 - 85:24)
address you gave the doorway wide open (85:21 - 85:26)
for them to start nitpicking everything (85:24 - 85:29)
else to prove their point like it was a (85:26 - 85:32)
chain reaction it wasn't like hey this (85:29 - 85:35)
isn't up to snuff until they heard that (85:32 - 85:36)
there wasn't gonna be everything in (85:35 - 85:38)
there but that was a chain reaction to (85:36 - 85:40)
it such a small percentage of people (85:38 - 85:42)
like at the start of this podcast we (85:40 - 85:43)
talked about how this was the fastest (85:42 - 85:45)
selling Pokemon game of all time right (85:43 - 85:49)
so you have a very small local community (85:45 - 85:51)
complaining and nitpicking these games (85:49 - 85:55)
and while it does reach it doesn't reach (85:51 - 85:57)
the majority of people it doesn't reach (85:55 - 85:59)
you know mom walking into store to buy (85:57 - 86:02)
new Pokemon game for son for Christmas (85:59 - 86:05)
it does reach us who deal in the pokemon (86:02 - 86:07)
community every day reach that son (86:05 - 86:09)
whether they ask for it or not like that (86:07 - 86:11)
son might be connected to those games (86:09 - 86:13)
that person might be looking at to say (86:11 - 86:15)
hey is this what I want to ask for or I (86:13 - 86:18)
have $60 where I can buy one game is (86:15 - 86:20)
this it and then you've got a flood of (86:18 - 86:24)
people online who are very loud and (86:20 - 86:27)
talking down your game like it may not (86:24 - 86:29)
reach the person that bought it but it's (86:27 - 86:31)
gonna reach the person that's deciding (86:29 - 86:34)
whether or not they want to ask for it (86:31 - 86:36)
maybe the games prove that they sold (86:34 - 86:38)
incredibly well so like how much did (86:36 - 86:42)
without with all that noise they they (86:38 - 86:44)
sold incredibly well they did I'm just (86:42 - 86:48)
not thrilled about any anything that (86:44 - 86:50)
gives (86:48 - 86:55)
any credence to the noise like the (86:50 - 86:57)
problem and you could go back to like (86:55 - 86:59)
seven years ago where Masuda was was (86:57 - 87:01)
saying like there wasn't DLC and then (86:59 - 87:03)
people being like what Masuda lied seven (87:01 - 87:06)
years ago there is DLC now and it's he (87:03 - 87:09)
did lie I mean he was right hey baby (87:06 - 87:11)
when you say you're never gonna do (87:09 - 87:12)
something and then you do it like I (87:11 - 87:14)
believe you also said at one point that (87:12 - 87:17)
Pokemon would always be a 2-d game yes (87:14 - 87:21)
yes he did so but also not even it (87:17 - 87:22)
wasn't even it's not even been five (87:21 - 87:25)
years ago where almost every game was 60 (87:22 - 87:28)
bucks and now the most popular games in (87:25 - 87:31)
the world are free fortnight Pokemon go (87:28 - 87:35)
legal legends DotA like these are free (87:31 - 87:36)
games that make more money than $60 (87:35 - 87:41)
games so I sure at one point DLC was (87:36 - 87:42)
never planned for a Pokemon game but now (87:41 - 87:44)
it is I don't know if it's the best way (87:42 - 87:46)
I don't think that these updates though (87:44 - 87:48)
are like some pivots to satisfied (87:46 - 87:51)
national Dexter's I think that in (87:48 - 87:55)
history when they added pokemon crystal (87:51 - 87:57)
they added more Pokemon when they did (87:55 - 87:59)
emerald they added more Pokemon when (87:57 - 88:00)
they did platinum they added more (87:59 - 88:03)
Pokemon when they did Sun and Moon it (88:00 - 88:05)
was 302 Pokemon ultra Sun altra Moon was (88:03 - 88:08)
400 Pokemon this is 400 Pokemon I think (88:05 - 88:11)
adding 100 Pokemon which in reality is (88:08 - 88:15)
not that many Pokemon because six six of (88:11 - 88:17)
those Pokemon are the new Duran family (88:15 - 88:20)
and Nolan's melon melon juicer and no (88:17 - 88:22)
one's using that arena or NIT arena (88:20 - 88:24)
so I guess out of that out of those six (88:22 - 88:26)
you're using two Nidoqueen tomato King (88:24 - 88:28)
so like a hundred Pokemon is is not a (88:26 - 88:30)
lot I don't think this also leads to (88:28 - 88:33)
them adding the rest of the Pokemon (88:30 - 88:37)
because I do still think that initial (88:33 - 88:39)
thing of we're not adding all the (88:37 - 88:40)
Pokemon what you get is what you get I (88:39 - 88:42)
still think that stands by it (88:40 - 88:45)
I don't think exploring like a new Beach (88:42 - 88:47)
region and not seeing new Pokemon would (88:45 - 88:49)
be particularly interesting but because (88:47 - 88:52)
there is now a beach there are Pokemon (88:49 - 88:54)
like slow poke maybe Psyduck that would (88:52 - 88:57)
probably exist on this beach in the (88:54 - 88:59)
winter area there will probably be (88:57 - 89:02)
pokémon like Metagross who is normally (88:59 - 89:04)
in the icy area (89:02 - 89:06)
of game or at least Metagross was in the (89:04 - 89:08)
icy area of black-and-white - that will (89:06 - 89:11)
probably exist these Pokemon aren't (89:08 - 89:14)
behind the paywall which was which is (89:11 - 89:16)
nice which was like some weird narrative (89:14 - 89:18)
that people started stirring up of like (89:16 - 89:20)
oh you have to pay $30 you get these 200 (89:18 - 89:22)
Pokemon no that's not true (89:20 - 89:24)
you just have to update your game once (89:22 - 89:25)
you update the game you can either (89:24 - 89:27)
transfer those Pokemon from black and (89:25 - 89:30)
white to or X&Y through Pokemon home (89:27 - 89:35)
into these games or you can trade if you (89:30 - 89:36)
don't want to pay for Pokemon home if (89:35 - 89:38)
assuming that that cost money you can (89:36 - 89:40)
trade with somebody who did catch a (89:38 - 89:43)
slowpoke or a Psyduck and trade it to (89:40 - 89:49)
you but I I think that this is I think I (89:43 - 89:52)
think I buy inherent I definitely 100% (89:49 - 89:54)
want this over a third version and I'm (89:52 - 89:56)
as I told you before I was like I'm (89:54 - 89:58)
hoping that they do it like they do with (89:56 - 90:00)
destiny where it's like a main game and (89:58 - 90:03)
then two subsequent DLCs and then (90:00 - 90:05)
another main game and they alternate (90:03 - 90:07)
that way and I think that's a really (90:05 - 90:09)
nice way to kind of keep interest in the (90:07 - 90:11)
game and keep it progressing and then (90:09 - 90:13)
you just like have a big bump and then (90:11 - 90:15)
here's new things to keep you interested (90:13 - 90:18)
as you go and then you're a big bump and (90:15 - 90:19)
you keep going like that I'm actually (90:18 - 90:22)
very curious because if you look at like (90:19 - 90:24)
the sales of Sun and Moon specifically (90:22 - 90:26)
that game sold like 16 million copies (90:24 - 90:28)
and then if you look at Ultra Sun (90:26 - 90:30)
ultramoon that game sold 8 million (90:28 - 90:34)
copies that's a lot of copies even the 8 (90:30 - 90:35)
million there's a lot of video games (90:34 - 90:37)
that you know struggle to even sell a (90:35 - 90:39)
million or two million so a million (90:37 - 90:42)
copies automatically awesome if you go (90:39 - 90:44)
back to Sun and Moon and if you say like (90:42 - 90:46)
man I wish I wish this game was better (90:44 - 90:48)
polished I wish they would have taken a (90:46 - 90:51)
year extra on Sun and Moon do I think an (90:48 - 90:55)
extra year of waiting makes that 16 (90:51 - 90:58)
million copies go up further I don't (90:55 - 91:01)
think so I think that you put out a game (90:58 - 91:03)
you sell 16 million you put out an (91:01 - 91:05)
enhanced version of that game and you (91:03 - 91:08)
sell another 8 million that's pretty (91:05 - 91:11)
good that's a lot of money to boat out a (91:08 - 91:14)
rehash version of your new game I also (91:11 - 91:18)
think though that that becomes a (91:14 - 91:21)
that becomes like some weird issue where (91:18 - 91:23)
I would never recommend Sun and Moon to (91:21 - 91:25)
anyone because Ultra Sun and ultra moon (91:23 - 91:28)
or platinum or emerald are significantly (91:25 - 91:31)
better games once you put enough time (91:28 - 91:34)
into those games it's very hard to go (91:31 - 91:37)
back like for me it's very hard to go (91:34 - 91:39)
back to Sun and Moon because I already (91:37 - 91:40)
caught all the pokemon and also senator (91:39 - 91:41)
ultra moon I already went out of my way (91:40 - 91:44)
to get all the TMS I already bought all (91:41 - 91:47)
the clothes I have 999 leper berries I (91:44 - 91:49)
have all these Rotom boosts and Sun and (91:47 - 91:52)
Moon offers none of that and I think (91:49 - 91:54)
there's probably a some part of the (91:52 - 91:59)
audience that would expect that expects (91:54 - 92:02)
a third version so it's like why would I (91:59 - 92:04)
why would I buy diamond pearl platinum (92:02 - 92:06)
will be the better version I'll wait for (92:04 - 92:08)
that it will have more Pokemon it will (92:06 - 92:10)
have more features it will fix issues (92:08 - 92:12)
the same with Ultra Sun all Tremayne why (92:10 - 92:13)
would I buy Sun and Moon when this is (92:12 - 92:15)
the better version and I do think that's (92:13 - 92:19)
why those games sell good well and and (92:15 - 92:21)
obviously Pokemon fans they want just (92:19 - 92:23)
more Pokemon so they'll buy it anyways (92:21 - 92:28)
but in this sense I feel really good and (92:23 - 92:31)
really comfortable investing even more (92:28 - 92:32)
time into these games because I don't (92:31 - 92:34)
have that feeling of starting over (92:32 - 92:38)
I have shook these berry trees and I (92:34 - 92:40)
hate the berry trees and sword and (92:38 - 92:41)
shield I think they're awful it is not a (92:40 - 92:44)
fun mechanic to like shade and wait and (92:41 - 92:47)
see no but I have shook them every day (92:44 - 92:49)
to get my berries because I don't know (92:47 - 92:52)
when I'm gonna need like 25 berries in (92:49 - 92:55)
order to reduce my happiness to fix my (92:52 - 92:59)
emails my berries but it puts this (92:55 - 93:01)
confidence in me that the things I am (92:59 - 93:03)
doing everyday like V I'll cram me (93:01 - 93:05)
sweets the berries collecting the watts (93:03 - 93:08)
having the money that I don't lose all (93:05 - 93:12)
of that by starting over again and I can (93:08 - 93:13)
comfortably continue playing these games (93:12 - 93:16)
and get more content and that that is a (93:13 - 93:17)
good feeling (93:16 - 93:19)
I don't mind starting over that has (93:17 - 93:21)
never bothered me like when Sun and Moon (93:19 - 93:22)
came out I was excited to catch all the (93:21 - 93:25)
Pokemon when X&Y came out I was excited (93:22 - 93:26)
to catch all the Pokemon even though I (93:25 - 93:29)
have those Pokemon there is there is a (93:26 - 93:32)
point we're starting over feels great (93:29 - 93:34)
I don't him starting over once a year (93:32 - 93:37)
particularly feels great especially in (93:34 - 93:39)
the past where the story's like slightly (93:37 - 93:43)
different and yeah it was cool that like (93:39 - 93:45)
whoo they added like Magnemite and stuff (93:43 - 93:46)
I think Magnemite was an ultra not in (93:45 - 93:49)
regular but if you don't add the new (93:46 - 93:51)
Pokemon no I agree (93:49 - 93:54)
they do just get like rainbow rocket and (93:51 - 93:55)
it was like well that was like two hours (93:54 - 93:57)
and that was cool but enough rainbow (93:55 - 94:00)
rocket was worth 40 bucks I mean we (93:57 - 94:01)
don't know that there's any worse 30 (94:00 - 94:03)
bikes I will say as a third version (94:01 - 94:06)
player usually when the third version (94:03 - 94:07)
came out I would want to play the game (94:06 - 94:10)
again and since I don't like deleting my (94:07 - 94:13)
old games I you know I want to keep what (94:10 - 94:14)
I caught there and be able to pass (94:13 - 94:17)
things through and I can pass items that (94:14 - 94:19)
I already got to make that play through (94:17 - 94:21)
easier and it can play it the way that I (94:19 - 94:23)
want I always enjoyed the third version (94:21 - 94:24)
when it came out because I usually (94:23 - 94:26)
wanting to play the game over again and (94:24 - 94:29)
I could customize it the way that I (94:26 - 94:33)
wanted from the beginning so not having (94:29 - 94:35)
that anymore is a disappointment to me (94:33 - 94:37)
because I don't get to have that (94:35 - 94:40)
experience of a third version that (94:37 - 94:42)
incorporates everything that's changed (94:40 - 94:43)
the story along the way that we've had (94:42 - 94:46)
in the past so I am mournful that that (94:43 - 94:48)
is gone I understand that I am very much (94:46 - 94:50)
in the minority of that but I did really (94:48 - 94:53)
always like the third version so I will (94:50 - 94:56)
miss that I also think the high praises (94:53 - 94:59)
that everybody's singing for something (94:56 - 95:01)
that's not out yet (94:59 - 95:04)
is it necessarily warranted well it's (95:01 - 95:06)
okay to be excited it's gonna be (95:04 - 95:08)
exciting out but like people are like (95:06 - 95:12)
absolutely bonkers about how this is (95:08 - 95:13)
going to be completely worth the money (95:12 - 95:15)
and it's absolutely everything that they (95:13 - 95:17)
wanted I'm like it's not even out yet (95:15 - 95:19)
how do you see my ID this is why I wanna (95:17 - 95:20)
do that (95:19 - 95:23)
this is I just live in my own little (95:20 - 95:25)
bubble I think it's super exciting I (95:23 - 95:27)
think why that excitement has blown up (95:25 - 95:29)
is because what they showed actually (95:27 - 95:32)
looked great the all the concept art (95:29 - 95:36)
looked gorgeous like the beach art like (95:32 - 95:39)
ministry the like building with the tree (95:36 - 95:40)
coming out of it in the mountainside (95:39 - 95:44)
looks great I think it was that st. so (95:40 - 95:48)
before the whole national dex news broke (95:44 - 95:50)
I think everyone was excited for sword (95:48 - 95:53)
and shield because of how it looked (95:50 - 95:56)
visually and for the most part if you (95:53 - 96:00)
put the national dex stuff aside and the (95:56 - 96:02)
pokemon not moving when you're on a (96:00 - 96:04)
ladder for the four ladders in that game (96:02 - 96:07)
there's a lot of n ladders in the area 8 (96:04 - 96:10)
X 4 here up and down those letters a (96:07 - 96:13)
whole lot about 80 chutes and ladders (96:10 - 96:18)
III think that Galler is one of the most (96:13 - 96:20)
beautiful regions they've ever made yes (96:18 - 96:23)
so III do think that I think it's very (96:20 - 96:25)
easy to be excited for this the question (96:23 - 96:29)
is is it is it worth 30 dollars (96:25 - 96:32)
yeah and that that will never be (96:29 - 96:35)
answered because some people like if you (96:32 - 96:38)
if you look at like a game gone look if (96:35 - 96:40)
you look at a game such as fire watch or (96:38 - 96:42)
gone home those games were twenty dollar (96:40 - 96:45)
games that are two hours long and a lot (96:42 - 96:47)
of people don't think that that's worth (96:45 - 96:51)
it whereas like a game such as destiny (96:47 - 96:54)
maybe that's a bad example but you could (96:51 - 96:56)
put a hundred hours into destiny for 60 (96:54 - 96:58)
bucks why cos Destiny's a free to play (96:56 - 97:00)
game or you could pay 60 bucks for (96:58 - 97:02)
overwatch and play for five minutes and (97:00 - 97:06)
realize you hate it so like that that (97:02 - 97:10)
argument of is the $30 worth it that's (97:06 - 97:11)
gonna be different for like every person (97:10 - 97:13)
yeah I mean (97:11 - 97:15)
but no I mean there are gonna be some (97:13 - 97:19)
like if it's just another wild area that (97:15 - 97:21)
really has nothing to the game I think a (97:19 - 97:22)
majority of people be like this (97:21 - 97:24)
definitely wasn't worth the price like (97:22 - 97:27)
there's definitely if it doesn't deliver (97:24 - 97:30)
enough on the promise that it's showing (97:27 - 97:33)
here then people are gonna say no that (97:30 - 97:35)
was not the value that I wanted like (97:33 - 97:38)
opinions will vary like you will decide (97:35 - 97:40)
how much value that you got out of it (97:38 - 97:45)
but if it is just a nothing area then I (97:40 - 97:47)
think a lot of people are gonna be like (97:45 - 97:50)
no that definitely wasn't worth it like (97:47 - 97:52)
if the gameplay that they add isn't fun (97:50 - 97:55)
if it is just a great big wide area with (97:52 - 97:58)
nothing else in there if it's just a (97:55 - 97:59)
small wild area with a couple of dead (97:58 - 98:01)
it's like there's a lot of ways that (97:59 - 98:03)
this can go wrong and I do agree that (98:01 - 98:06)
what value you get out of it is your own (98:03 - 98:09)
personal opinion but there is definitely (98:06 - 98:13)
a way that a game cannot deliver for the (98:09 - 98:14)
price point that everybody can agree on (98:13 - 98:17)
that didn't deliver for how much I paid (98:14 - 98:17)
for it (98:17 - 98:19)
yeah and it's also gonna be tough (98:17 - 98:22)
because it's divided in two and so you (98:19 - 98:24)
kind of have to say I'm paying $15 for (98:22 - 98:27)
one and $15 for the other right and (98:24 - 98:30)
they're spread out so it's it's gonna be (98:27 - 98:33)
a very hard the advantage that hammer (98:30 - 98:36)
very low is you have to buy both so if (98:33 - 98:37)
somebody came into the island out of (98:36 - 98:39)
armour and they were like oh this wild (98:37 - 98:42)
area is small and disappointing and (98:39 - 98:45)
not great and I don't like the dojo (98:42 - 98:47)
stuff because maybe it's battle heavy (98:45 - 98:50)
and the new clothes do nothing for me (98:47 - 98:52)
they they could walk away from that (98:50 - 98:57)
extremely disappointed but I don't think (98:52 - 98:58)
that disappointment would be strong (98:57 - 99:00)
enough for them to be like I'm just (98:58 - 99:02)
gonna skip the crown Tundra because (99:00 - 99:03)
they've already paid for the counter on (99:02 - 99:06)
Tundra I mean there's a lot of people (99:03 - 99:08)
who I mean (99:06 - 99:12)
well can do this her like I played five (99:08 - 99:13)
minutes of it it wasn't worth me and I'm (99:12 - 99:14)
not touching it again (99:13 - 99:16)
I bought DLC for Mario Cart and never (99:14 - 99:19)
played it yeah at all like so it is (99:16 - 99:21)
definitely a possibility that if the (99:19 - 99:23)
first one doesn't come out of the gate (99:21 - 99:25)
hot that people are like while I already (99:23 - 99:27)
wasted my money and I do not want to (99:25 - 99:29)
play this game or cost phallus yeah okay (99:27 - 99:31)
so the difference is between the two (99:29 - 99:34)
island of armor will be a new area yep (99:31 - 99:37)
we'll have new Pokemon a hundred of them (99:34 - 99:40)
according to Pokemon calm will have new (99:37 - 99:43)
clothing and will have handy features (99:40 - 99:46)
items and more I don't know what those (99:43 - 99:48)
are I don't know if that's like I think (99:46 - 99:50)
to some people if they added mass (99:48 - 99:53)
releasing of Pokemon through breathing I (99:50 - 99:55)
feel like to those people that is worth (99:53 - 99:59)
$30 no I I suspect this since it's a (99:55 - 100:01)
fighting focused that it will be things (99:59 - 100:05)
generous like breeding and preparing (100:01 - 100:08)
teams for doing any kind of BGC type (100:05 - 100:10)
battling will be made much easier I (100:08 - 100:13)
personally would pay $30 if they had an (100:10 - 100:17)
inverse bottle cap where I could make (100:13 - 100:18)
any pokemons (100:17 - 100:22)
speed stat zero IVs for trick room teams (100:18 - 100:24)
because breeding for 0iv (100:22 - 100:27)
trick room Pokemon is the worst (100:24 - 100:29)
experience ever but that's it's (100:27 - 100:31)
different for everyone but that's what (100:29 - 100:32)
part one says it's including part two (100:31 - 100:36)
says it's including a new area new (100:32 - 100:39)
Pokemon 100 new Pokemon a new co-op play (100:36 - 100:40)
feature which we talked about was (100:39 - 100:43)
actually walking around in the dens you (100:40 - 100:48)
go into and new clothing items and more (100:43 - 100:51)
part one has clothing items as a bullet (100:48 - 100:53)
point and handy features items and more (100:51 - 100:55)
as a bullet point this just has clothing (100:53 - 100:58)
items and more as a bullet point so I (100:55 - 101:01)
don't exactly know what that is oh I'm (100:58 - 101:03)
sure the walking around the dens it's (101:01 - 101:05)
gonna be really like that's an extensive (101:03 - 101:09)
bit of programming so that's why they (101:05 - 101:12)
couldn't do a bunch of other stuff (101:09 - 101:14)
I think I think maybe it's maybe obvious (101:12 - 101:16)
but we're not getting like a 20/20 (101:14 - 101:18)
Pokemon game we are getting one it's (101:16 - 101:21)
called mystery dungeon you sure they (101:18 - 101:23)
spent three years on sword and shield (101:21 - 101:25)
I don't know when sword and shield got (101:23 - 101:26)
finished I don't know if that was like (101:25 - 101:30)
August or September or like right up to (101:26 - 101:32)
the point because that game didn't ship (101:30 - 101:35)
with an update so what was there what (101:32 - 101:37)
was what was there when it came out and (101:35 - 101:40)
it's been two months since it came out (101:37 - 101:42)
and they have (101:40 - 101:45)
more months before the next update came (101:42 - 101:48)
out and they're using the same engine so (101:45 - 101:50)
with specifically ultra Sun ultramoon (101:48 - 101:53)
that game came out in 364 days less than (101:50 - 101:56)
a year using the same engine and they (101:53 - 102:00)
were able to deliver that game timeline (101:56 - 102:01)
wise I don't think that this seems (102:00 - 102:04)
rushed I don't I don't feel like this (102:01 - 102:06)
was content that was hidden in the game (102:04 - 102:09)
that they cut to sell back to us oh no (102:06 - 102:11)
not at all and I don't like people (102:09 - 102:13)
making that argument I've seen people (102:11 - 102:16)
make that argument I think that if this (102:13 - 102:18)
DLC had never been announced or it (102:16 - 102:21)
didn't exist that sword and shield are (102:18 - 102:24)
the same level of Pokemon game you've (102:21 - 102:27)
always gotten before that the story is (102:24 - 102:29)
there there's supposedly postgame I (102:27 - 102:34)
haven't seen but it's there's nothing (102:29 - 102:37)
about these that are less than a typical (102:34 - 102:38)
Pokemon game where I would indicate that (102:37 - 102:42)
they cut stuff out for whatever purpose (102:38 - 102:45)
first we're creating the DLC so I I (102:42 - 102:48)
don't want to see that argument angry I (102:45 - 102:51)
don't think this one is but I don't want (102:48 - 102:53)
to see that in the future (102:51 - 102:55)
and that's a concern see what in the (102:53 - 102:57)
future what we see with a lot of games (102:55 - 103:00)
where oh you cut stuff to sell you back (102:57 - 103:03)
because DLC isn't accepted like there's (103:00 - 103:05)
an inherent danger with this DLC in that (103:03 - 103:07)
they can fall into the trap that other (103:05 - 103:09)
companies have where they cut stuff from (103:07 - 103:11)
games and sell it back to you and that (103:09 - 103:13)
is that is my prime concern around any (103:11 - 103:15)
DLC anything and I have that concern (103:13 - 103:16)
here (103:15 - 103:19)
I think the breath awhile DLC was very (103:16 - 103:22)
well received I know one of them was I I (103:19 - 103:24)
know another one and they have to thank (103:22 - 103:27)
you it was love it was people were like (103:24 - 103:29)
really and I'm sure there are people (103:27 - 103:32)
that have you know like the conversation (103:29 - 103:36)
we had with wills friends last week (103:32 - 103:37)
play through the game they saw the (103:36 - 103:39)
credits they were satisfied with their (103:37 - 103:42)
sixty bucks they will not buy this not (103:39 - 103:44)
because they don't think it's the they (103:42 - 103:46)
don't think it's worth it they just are (103:44 - 103:48)
playing other games and they don't need (103:46 - 103:50)
more pokemon in their life at this point (103:48 - 103:53)
in time yep they've moved on and on the (103:50 - 103:55)
flipside my husband who's never played a (103:53 - 103:56)
lot of puck of my game about the (103:55 - 104:01)
expansion pass so we'll see let's take a (103:56 - 104:05)
break because we've become forever the (104:01 - 104:09)
long episode all right we will be right (104:05 - 104:10)
back with our question of the week and (104:09 - 104:15)
our Pokemon of the week be right back (104:10 - 104:15)
[Music] (104:19 - 104:50)
a little bit more here new characters we (104:46 - 104:53)
didn't talk about this a man named (104:50 - 104:55)
mustard will appear in the island of (104:53 - 104:57)
armor and will be responsible for (104:55 - 104:59)
players training he's a legendary (104:57 - 105:01)
trainer who held the seat of champion (104:59 - 105:04)
for 18 years back when Dynomax (105:01 - 105:06)
incorporated into battles of the Pokemon (105:04 - 105:08)
League his record has yet to be beaten (105:06 - 105:12)
in fact champion Leon himself trained (105:08 - 105:14)
under mustard and mustard was the first (105:12 - 105:17)
one to recognize Leon's talent so there (105:14 - 105:19)

someday set up a gym and stadium of (105:39 - 105:43)
their own type trainers will face (105:41 - 105:44)
different rivals depending on which game (105:43 - 105:47)
they're playing Clara will specialize in (105:44 - 105:48)

smile on her face but is hiding behind (106:10 - 106:14)
behind behind it is a calculating nature (106:11 - 106:16)
that she puts to very good use Avery is (106:14 - 106:18)
one of the trainers who strive to become (106:16 - 106:21)
stronger and musters dojo and he is a (106:18 - 106:23)
proficient user of psychic pokémon (106:21 - 106:26)

is also very proud and have sweet socks (106:26 - 106:32)
there was a there was a little bit of (106:31 - 106:34)
people talking about how maybe Avery is (106:32 - 106:38)
non-binary but doesn't seem to be the (106:34 - 106:39)
case according to this press release (106:38 - 106:42)
yeah which is a missed opportunity new (106:39 - 106:44)
features added in the island of armor (106:42 - 106:47)
and Crown tundra there are over a (106:44 - 106:50)
hundred wait what there will be over 100 (106:47 - 106:53)
new clothing items added in the Isle (106:50 - 106:55)

Crown tundra in the island of armor (107:07 - 107:11)
trainers will also find new items that (107:09 - 107:12)
will help along their journey such as (107:11 - 107:16)
such as the experienced charm that will (107:12 - 107:17)
come in handy while leveling up their (107:16 - 107:20)
new Pokemon new tutor moves that have (107:17 - 107:23)
never been available in the past Pokemon (107:20 - 107:25)
Core Series game will also appear in the (107:23 - 107:27)
island of armor expansion along with (107:25 - 107:30)
restricted sparring where trainers will (107:27 - 107:32)
be limited to what what types of Pokemon (107:30 - 107:34)
they can be used and forced to battle (107:32 - 107:38)
under set conditions in the crown Tundra (107:34 - 107:39)
expansion trainers and their friends (107:38 - 107:41)
will be able to enter and explore dens (107:39 - 107:43)
in a new gameplay feature deep inside (107:41 - 107:45)
these dens they will have a chance to (107:43 - 107:46)
encounter legendary Pokemon from (107:45 - 107:50)
previous Pokemon core game series so for (107:46 - 107:54)
example they showed new forms of (107:50 - 107:57)
Articuno Moltres and Zapdos and they've (107:54 - 107:59)
shown old legendary Pokemon returning (107:57 - 108:04)
such as the Reggie's and what the (107:59 - 108:06)
Reggie's had new forms also it's true (108:04 - 108:10)
are they just really new reg AG's they (108:06 - 108:13)
could be the Reggie's good cool for me (108:10 - 108:16)
they looked great I can't talk about (108:13 - 108:17)
some guys (108:16 - 108:20)
no no I'm excited for them Reggie (108:17 - 108:25)
electric and Reggie Reggie little hmm (108:20 - 108:28)
Reggie what is it Reggie steel is (108:25 - 108:29)
already one so why would this one be (108:28 - 108:31)
Reggie dragon (108:29 - 108:36)
regi read many but that means that (108:31 - 108:40)
you're found at the gallery wild area (108:36 - 108:41)
will make their home on the island of (108:40 - 108:43)
armor or crown tendrá trainers will have (108:41 - 108:46)
their gallery pokedex is updated they (108:43 - 108:48)
can register even more Pokemon as they (108:46 - 108:50)
discover the island of armor players (108:48 - 108:53)
will aim to complete the isle armor (108:50 - 108:56)
pokedex while on Kandra they will be (108:53 - 108:58)
working on the crown Tundra pokedex so (108:56 - 109:00)
because these are separate pokedex 'as (108:58 - 109:01)
they're not gonna take away your shiny (109:00 - 109:03)
charm I don't know why people is like (109:01 - 109:06)
worried about that like in what reality (109:03 - 109:09)
would they be like well well it doesn't (109:06 - 109:13)
work anymore doesn't worry enough (109:09 - 109:13)
I am assuming there will probably be a (109:13 - 109:17)
reward for completing these two but who (109:15 - 109:20)
knows the real the ultra shiny charm (109:17 - 109:21)
yeah thank you finally get your ultra (109:20 - 109:23)
Chinese there are Pokemon dens on the (109:21 - 109:26)
island of armor and count a crown Tundra (109:23 - 109:27)
just like in the wild area when trainers (109:26 - 109:29)
check out the den that has a pillar of (109:27 - 109:30)
red light coming out of it (109:29 - 109:32)
they will be able to participate in a (109:30 - 109:34)
max rate battle there are battles where (109:32 - 109:36)
players will be able to team up with 300 (109:34 - 109:38)
trainers to take on dynamaxx pokemon in (109:36 - 109:40)
the Pokemon dens of the island of armor (109:38 - 109:41)
and Crown tundra trainers will be able (109:40 - 109:43)
to encounter Pokemon that are not found (109:41 - 109:45)
in the wild area they will be unable to (109:43 - 109:47)
invite their friends to join these max (109:45 - 109:50)
ray battles and just not friends who are (109:47 - 109:51)
playing using the pokemon sword (109:50 - 109:53)
expansion pass or shield expansion paths (109:51 - 109:56)
players will be able to invite to have (109:53 - 109:58)
friends even if they are playing sword (109:56 - 110:00)
and shield without the expansion patch (109:58 - 110:02)
to join them so that answers that (110:00 - 110:08)
question for people so not only can you (110:02 - 110:11)
get all 200 new Pokemon without paying (110:08 - 110:15)
you can also participate in these new (110:11 - 110:19)
max raid dens without paying would you (110:15 - 110:26)
happen to talk behind a paywall so what (110:19 - 110:27)
person pays and then everyone else (110:26 - 110:32)
benefit exactly ah there was a which of (110:27 - 110:33)
you is gonna pay ha (110:32 - 110:36)
great you already paid so well benefit (110:33 - 110:38)
off though your I'll expect checks in (110:36 - 110:41)
the mail for your thirds ok we talked (110:38 - 110:44)
about the 1.1 updates with the sneak (110:41 - 110:48)
peek if you purchase the pre order early (110:44 - 110:49)
you will get the outfits we talked about (110:48 - 110:54)
that they're kind of ugly let's let's (110:49 - 110:55)
save all the mystery dungeon stuff till (110:54 - 110:57)
next week there's actually a lot here (110:55 - 110:58)
for the mystery dungeon stuff and I (110:57 - 111:01)
don't want to just as much as I'm not a (110:58 - 111:03)
mystery dungeon fan I don't want to like (111:01 - 111:06)
give it a disservice I think that the (111:03 - 111:09)
fact that a spin-off game didn't come (111:06 - 111:12)
out on mobile is actually a big deal so (111:09 - 111:13)
we'll save all the mystery dungeon stuff (111:12 - 111:16)
for next week there is a new so to (111:13 - 111:19)
finally get to finally get away from all (111:16 - 111:21)
the DLC Pokemon news I think we covered (111:19 - 111:27)
it all there is a new online competition (111:21 - 111:30)
called the gallery newcomers you can (111:27 - 111:33)
sign up until January 30th we'll go more (111:30 - 111:36)
in depth on that next week but just like (111:33 - 111:38)
everyone who missed the signups for the (111:36 - 111:41)
first period just sign up now you don't (111:38 - 111:43)
have to register your team until the (111:41 - 111:46)
competition starts so we'll get that out (111:43 - 111:49)
of the way I do want to talk about this (111:46 - 111:50)
though (111:49 - 111:52)
but the Pokemon company also announced (111:50 - 111:56)
changes to the TCG and I want to make (111:52 - 111:58)
changes that I don't understand big (111:56 - 112:00)
changes you don't play it this was (111:58 - 112:02)
unexpected they didn't talk about this (112:00 - 112:03)
in litter echt they just posted on (112:02 - 112:05)
Pokemon comm no one ever checks Pokemon (112:03 - 112:08)
comm that's why we got to read it so the (112:05 - 112:10)
new sword and shield TCG starts February (112:08 - 112:15)
7th 2020 will have 200 Pokemon cards it (112:10 - 112:18)
will introduce v-max Pokemon and Pokemon (112:15 - 112:22)
V cards make your jokes now there's a (112:18 - 112:24)
couple big changes I think we'll we'll (112:22 - 112:25)
have some good insight here and Greg (112:24 - 112:27)
will be like why did they make these (112:25 - 112:31)
changes true why did you do this ok (112:27 - 112:34)
these are huge changes which I think (112:31 - 112:36)
goes back to our conversation of maybe (112:34 - 112:38)
them I know Greg and I disagree on the (112:36 - 112:41)
competitive stuff but these are pretty (112:38 - 112:43)
unheard of changes in the TCG which is (112:41 - 112:45)
why I'm thinking they will make some (112:43 - 112:47)
dramatic changes in the video games the (112:45 - 112:50)
doc pack the dunk is not back in fact if (112:47 - 112:52)
they won't ever be back in fact it's (112:50 - 112:54)
even harder to dunk so the first change (112:52 - 112:57)
here is first turn at the start of X&Y (112:54 - 112:59)
series a rule was introduced to prevent (112:57 - 113:01)
a player from going from attacking on (112:59 - 113:03)
their first turn starting February 21st (113:01 - 113:06)
2020 the date that the Pokemon TCG (113:03 - 113:08)
becomes legal for tournament play there (113:06 - 113:10)
is an additional restriction the player (113:08 - 113:12)
who goes first cannot play a supporter (113:10 - 113:14)
card on their first turn this changes to (113:12 - 113:17)
attempt to make it less and less of an (113:14 - 113:18)
advantage to go first (113:17 - 113:19)
some strategies may benefit when a (113:18 - 113:22)
player goes second but others might not (113:19 - 113:24)
work out if a player goes first (113:22 - 113:25)
we hope this results in interesting (113:24 - 113:27)
choices in both gameplay and deck (113:25 - 113:29)
building please note that the Pokemon (113:27 - 113:31)
TCG pre-release events will be played (113:29 - 113:34)
using these rules thanks like that one (113:31 - 113:36)
so will do you want to explain real (113:34 - 113:38)
quick just what a supporter card is and (113:36 - 113:40)
why it's important that you can't play (113:38 - 113:43)
now so a supporter is typically (113:40 - 113:47)
represented by a MPC from the Pokemon (113:43 - 113:50)
world you can only play one for two per (113:47 - 113:52)
turn so they usually have a more (113:50 - 113:54)
powerful effect (113:52 - 113:56)
I'm the good ones there there are always (113:54 - 114:00)
bad supporters out there but the other (113:56 - 114:03)
thing is a lot of there is a lot of (114:00 - 114:04)
supporters that do things to your (114:03 - 114:07)
opponent so if you're playing one on (114:04 - 114:09)
your first turn and doing things to your (114:07 - 114:11)
opponent that has just gotten set up (114:09 - 114:12)
when they haven't even had a chance to (114:11 - 114:14)
play at all yet that's really unfair (114:12 - 114:16)
like you could play an N on your first (114:14 - 114:18)
turn and cause your opponent to have to (114:16 - 114:20)
like just reshuffle in their height hand (114:18 - 114:24)
in and lose one card which is just mean (114:20 - 114:26)
if they like we're like looking forward (114:24 - 114:28)
to like you're having a good turn and (114:26 - 114:30)
now all of a sudden they can tap that (114:28 - 114:31)
turn that they were planning for anyways (114:30 - 114:34)
so I like that one I think they're so (114:31 - 114:37)
before the x and y change which was what (114:34 - 114:42)
x and y was 6 2004 11 years 6 years ago (114:37 - 114:44)
5 years ago there was a statistic that (114:42 - 114:48)
said that obviously just I I'm pretty (114:44 - 114:52)
sure was if you went first you were 80% (114:48 - 114:54)
likely to win the game in the Pokemon (114:52 - 114:55)
Trading Card Game (114:54 - 114:57)
statistically and then when they they (114:55 - 114:59)
changed it so you couldn't attack on (114:57 - 115:02)
your first turn that dramatically (114:59 - 115:06)
reduced that statistic because back in (115:02 - 115:09)
the day there used to be a donk so if (115:06 - 115:10)
you went first and you were able to play (115:09 - 115:11)
a supporter on your first turn and (115:10 - 115:13)
attack on your first turn you were able (115:11 - 115:15)
to knock out your opponent before they (115:13 - 115:17)
even were able to play and you would win (115:15 - 115:20)
the game that was very very popular back (115:17 - 115:24)
in the the black and white series the (115:20 - 115:26)
donk okay this is another big change (115:24 - 115:28)
although it doesn't seem that big on it (115:26 - 115:30)
doesn't seem that big when I'm reading (115:28 - 115:31)
it but it's actually super important (115:30 - 115:34)
weakness and resistant resistance so if (115:31 - 115:36)
we're over a decade all the way black (115:34 - 115:38)
back to the diamond and pearl series (115:36 - 115:40)
resistance always meant that a Pokemon (115:38 - 115:42)
would take 20 less damage from the (115:40 - 115:45)
listed type however Pokemon introduced (115:42 - 115:46)
in Pokemon sword and shield will have a (115:45 - 115:49)
resistance of negative 30 instead of (115:46 - 115:52)
negative 20 so for example Sashi and V (115:49 - 115:54)
has a resistance of negative 32 (115:52 - 115:54)
grass-type (115:54 - 115:57)
Pokemon any Pokemon in a previous series (115:54 - 115:59)
will have a negative 20 resistance will (115:57 - 116:01)
be continued to be treated that way (115:59 - 116:03)
following what's written on the card so (116:01 - 116:06)
you might think well that's not a big (116:03 - 116:08)
deal they've only changed it from 24 to (116:06 - 116:12)
30 what is 10 damage actually mean 10 (116:08 - 116:13)
damage like makes and breaks a lot of (116:12 - 116:17)
Pokemon Trading Card does let me ask the (116:13 - 116:19)
questions like don't ask these questions (116:17 - 116:22)
for me I have one job oh sorry Greg (116:19 - 116:25)
asked the question 'is what difference (116:22 - 116:27)
does 10 damage make that doesn't seem (116:25 - 116:31)
like a lot so so 10 damage is a lot so (116:27 - 116:32)
specifically in the black and white (116:31 - 116:34)
series I think this is the easiest to (116:32 - 116:37)
understand there there were two very (116:34 - 116:41)
dominant Pokemon that had 130 HP but the (116:37 - 116:43)
problem is almost all the Pokemon in (116:41 - 116:45)
that game did a hundred and twenty (116:43 - 116:48)
damage so is very hard to knock out a (116:45 - 116:51)
any of these Pokemon because the (116:48 - 116:53)
threshold of damage was 120 and a lot of (116:51 - 116:57)
Pokemon had 130 HP there were Pokemon (116:53 - 117:00)
that could do more than 120 damage but (116:57 - 117:03)
it was a lot harder to do that most (117:00 - 117:07)
games are won by either one shotting a (117:03 - 117:10)
Pokemon or two shotting a Pokemon yeah (117:07 - 117:12)
because there's always multipliers and (117:10 - 117:14)
everything like that so that's what you (117:12 - 117:16)
have to keep in mind so it does this (117:14 - 117:18)
deal like we've talked about it before (117:16 - 117:20)
but just does this deal with the power (117:18 - 117:23)
creep in an effective way does it deal (117:20 - 117:25)
with HP creep in an effective way like (117:23 - 117:28)
whether it's gonna be effective as TBD (117:25 - 117:32)
but okay impression that it will be or (117:28 - 117:34)
is it like something addressing it yes I (117:32 - 117:36)
think it's a way of addressing it I also (117:34 - 117:39)
think that they've done a bad job at (117:36 - 117:43)
making resistance matter for the most (117:39 - 117:45)
part like even if something had (117:43 - 117:48)
resistance which is pretty which wasn't (117:45 - 117:51)
as common as you would think you were (117:48 - 117:53)
doing so much damage anyway that it (117:51 - 117:55)
didn't matter we'll have to see how many (117:53 - 117:59)
new cards are focused on resistance and (117:55 - 118:02)
there might be more resistances because (117:59 - 118:05)
they are now changing (118:02 - 118:08)
they are not changing weakness as well (118:05 - 118:11)
so weakness is the same except they are (118:08 - 118:14)
changing matchup types which is actually (118:11 - 118:14)
huge (118:14 - 118:17)
so traditionally so let me read let me (118:14 - 118:19)
read it what what's happening and then (118:17 - 118:21)
I'll go back to traditionally water type (118:19 - 118:22)
Pokemon (118:21 - 118:27)
well we're weakness to lightning instead (118:22 - 118:30)
of grass psychic-type pokémon have a (118:27 - 118:32)
weakness to darkness instead of psychic (118:30 - 118:34)
and dark pokemon will now be weak to (118:32 - 118:40)
grass instead of fighting so there's a (118:34 - 118:43)
sense yes this is like really weird (118:40 - 118:45)
water so what they're saying is water (118:43 - 118:47)
type Pokemon were traditionally always (118:45 - 118:49)
weak to grass there were exceptions to (118:47 - 118:51)
that but now they're saying the primary (118:49 - 118:53)
the primary amount of water pokemon (118:51 - 118:55)
cards that will exist will be weak to (118:53 - 118:57)
lightning instead of grass there will (118:55 - 118:59)
probably be exceptions psychic-type (118:57 - 119:01)
pokémon were almost always weak to (118:59 - 119:04)
psychic so if first so if as Mewtwo VORs (119:01 - 119:06)
Mewtwo which is a very popular matchup (119:04 - 119:08)
because me two cards are normally very (119:06 - 119:10)
good mutant would always be weak to each (119:08 - 119:14)
other and now they're changing it so (119:10 - 119:16)
psychic-type pokémon are weak to (119:14 - 119:19)
dark-type pokémon but dark-type pokémon (119:16 - 119:21)
were always weak to fighting but now (119:19 - 119:23)
they're changing dark-type pokémon to be (119:21 - 119:25)
weak to grass which I guess technically (119:23 - 119:26)
makes sense (119:25 - 119:28)
because water will no longer be weak to (119:26 - 119:32)
grass so and just for Greg's (119:28 - 119:35)
understanding yeah why grass with that (119:32 - 119:37)
grass that's not a thing in the game (119:35 - 119:44)
grass is bug and grass like poison water (119:37 - 119:47)
grass or psychic now now poison was (119:44 - 119:51)
psychic and before psychic was psychic (119:47 - 119:54)
ghost and poison (119:51 - 119:57)
so that's why psychic was weak to (119:54 - 120:00)
psychic fighting was also fighting rock (119:57 - 120:07)
and ground yes so now here's one of the (120:00 - 120:11)
biggest changes ever the ferry type (120:07 - 120:13)
which was introduced in the X&Y series (120:11 - 120:16)
will no longer be supported and sword (120:13 - 120:18)
and shield series bad for Fairy Type I (120:16 - 120:21)
don't I don't just because very much on (120:18 - 120:24)
its own and it was being weird and it (120:21 - 120:26)
just it never should have happened (120:24 - 120:30)
yeah rude ah they like being alone don't (120:26 - 120:33)
treat your introverts like that Pokemon (120:30 - 120:35)
that we're fairy types in the video game (120:33 - 120:37)
series will now generally be represented (120:35 - 120:40)
as psychic-type pokémon envy pokemon TCG (120:37 - 120:42)
to maintain balance pokemon that our (120:40 - 120:44)
poison in the video games will not be (120:42 - 120:46)
represented as dark-type pokémon instead (120:44 - 120:48)
of psychic pokémon instead of psychic (120:46 - 120:50)
type for the time being basic fairy (120:48 - 120:52)
energy can still be used in the standard (120:50 - 120:54)
format but this mate this rule may be (120:52 - 120:58)
changed in the future so so let's let's (120:54 - 121:00)
kind of back up here when the Pokemon (120:58 - 121:02)
Trading Card Game first came out there (121:00 - 121:04)
was grass fire water lightning psychic (121:02 - 121:07)
fighting and colorless and then when (121:04 - 121:10)
they added dark and steel to the video (121:07 - 121:13)
game they then added darkness and metal (121:10 - 121:18)
to the TCG and that remained pretty (121:13 - 121:22)
unchanged until they were like (121:18 - 121:25)
until they were like let's add dragon (121:22 - 121:29)
type to the dragon wasn't too bad (121:25 - 121:31)
because it didn't have its own energy it (121:29 - 121:33)
always just relied on a combination of (121:31 - 121:36)
other energies right so when they added (121:33 - 121:39)
dragon which was a big deal they didn't (121:36 - 121:41)
add dragon well they added dragon energy (121:39 - 121:42)
but it was like a special energy it was (121:41 - 121:46)
no basic energy yeah and dragon for the (121:42 - 121:49)
most part was just weak to drag him like (121:46 - 121:52)
the video game was and then they added (121:49 - 121:55)
Fairy and they made Dragon week to Fairy (121:52 - 122:00)
and they made some dark Pokemon week to (121:55 - 122:03)
fairy but not all dark Pokemon were (122:00 - 122:05)
strong to psychic because psychic was (122:03 - 122:07)
usually weak to psychic but then also (122:05 - 122:09)
some dark Pokemon were weak to fighting (122:07 - 122:13)
so if anything all fairy really did was (122:09 - 122:15)
make dark pokemon be in this weird spot (122:13 - 122:18)
uh and made dragons be in a weird spot (122:15 - 122:22)
and then like Fairy was only weak to for (122:18 - 122:24)
the most part metal because poison (122:22 - 122:27)
Pokemon were classified as psychic but (122:24 - 122:30)
fairy was never weak to psychic so you (122:27 - 122:33)
have this type which was supposed to (122:30 - 122:36)
make the game more fun but instead it (122:33 - 122:38)
just made pretty much all Dracon pokemon (122:36 - 122:41)
pretty useless and it didn't actually (122:38 - 122:44)
benefit metal pokemon like you would (122:41 - 122:46)
think like oh well you just counter (122:44 - 122:48)
fairy with metal but metal was still (122:46 - 122:51)
never really good because metal was also (122:48 - 122:54)
weak to fire and some were weak to (122:51 - 122:57)
fighting I don't know it's it's kind of (122:54 - 122:58)
hard to explain because there's always (122:57 - 123:00)
exceptions to that you could always look (122:58 - 123:01)
at a card and you could be like oh this (123:00 - 123:04)
one's weak to something but it added (123:01 - 123:10)
this weird not like loophole it just you (123:04 - 123:11)
you would think you're adding a mechanic (123:10 - 123:13)
to make the game more fun and I don't (123:11 - 123:17)
think ferry ever felt like oh boy this (123:13 - 123:19)
is even more fun now that we're playing (123:17 - 123:23)
with fairy well I mean my first Sarnia (123:19 - 123:26)
stack was and then it wasn't fun anymore (123:23 - 123:28)
yeah (123:26 - 123:30)
thumbs up thumbs down from both you (123:28 - 123:32)
thumbs up very going away go thumbs up (123:30 - 123:35)
thumbs up yeah thumbs up this actually (123:32 - 123:37)
makes me really fell into the game yeah (123:35 - 123:39)
play it (123:37 - 123:41)
um I still don't like the like best (123:39 - 123:43)
two-out-of-three that they have like I (123:41 - 123:44)
understand the best two out of three (123:43 - 123:47)
because like sometimes you can get (123:44 - 123:49)
caught off-guard by a deck but now that (123:47 - 123:51)
you know how the deck works you have (123:49 - 123:53)
such a good advantage to maybe counter (123:51 - 123:54)
that the next time you play (123:53 - 123:58)
it's just pokemon TCG games take way too (123:54 - 124:01)
long and so when you're in a tournament (123:58 - 124:03)
setting of like okay it's best two out (124:01 - 124:06)
of three and you lose the first match (124:03 - 124:08)
and that was like a 25 minute game you (124:06 - 124:10)
have like 20 minutes to try to tie it (124:08 - 124:13)
and then you have this like third game (124:10 - 124:14)
that's going to go to time so you might (124:13 - 124:16)
as well just flip a coin of who wins cuz (124:14 - 124:18)
it's like who's gonna go first and who's (124:16 - 124:20)
gonna get set up faster and we only have (124:18 - 124:21)
three times you're gonna get (124:20 - 124:24)
disqualified but you know what I mean (124:21 - 124:27)
like ideally like the smart played to do (124:24 - 124:29)
would be like okay I'm losing so I'm (124:27 - 124:31)
gonna scoop right away within like the (124:29 - 124:33)
first ten minutes so I can get a better (124:31 - 124:34)
second game in so I can get a strong (124:33 - 124:37)
third game in but inherently like they (124:34 - 124:40)
could still drag out that second game so (124:37 - 124:41)
you can't even get a strong third game (124:40 - 124:44)
in and the Pokemon to the Pokemon video (124:41 - 124:48)
the Pokemon VGC has built-in timers and (124:44 - 124:51)
those games go much faster so even if (124:48 - 124:55)
like the time limit was 45 minutes the (124:51 - 124:58)
timer in the game is 15 minutes locked (124:55 - 125:01)
so you can fit three games in in 45 (124:58 - 125:05)
minutes or at most you're going to win (125:01 - 125:08)
two games at at at most in 30 minutes so (125:05 - 125:12)
you get 15 minutes to like recoup before (125:08 - 125:15)
the next match and and that's to say if (125:12 - 125:19)
your game is going to 15 minutes so I (125:15 - 125:21)
still think an inherent problem with the (125:19 - 125:27)
TCG is how long it takes which I don't (125:21 - 125:28)
know if I don't know I don't know if the (125:27 - 125:30)
new cards will make those games feel (125:28 - 125:34)
faster and still fun but (125:30 - 125:37)
I think removing fairy-type is a good is (125:34 - 125:40)
good I think it's fine (125:37 - 125:42)
um and then I think ideally you see more (125:40 - 125:45)
dragon and you probably still don't see (125:42 - 125:49)
more metal but metal is its whatever (125:45 - 125:52)
metal is whatever like I don't know how (125:49 - 125:54)
you save metal for metal at this point (125:52 - 126:00)
um but uh sure I mean it'll exist I'm (125:54 - 126:01)
trying to think if there was any (126:00 - 126:02)
actually really good metal decks and I (126:01 - 126:05)
can't think of one right now uh Reggie (126:02 - 126:08)
Steele had like a half second in the Sun (126:05 - 126:13)
yeah I think melt metal had a quarter of (126:08 - 126:15)
a second in the Sun (126:13 - 126:18)
for a most part there are some other (126:15 - 126:20)
changes they've they've changed some (126:18 - 126:25)
cards specifically for expanded lakelyn (126:20 - 126:26)
berry palp add citrus very quick ball (126:25 - 126:29)
those were changed there's a now a new (126:26 - 126:31)
term called Pokemon checkup which (126:29 - 126:34)
replaces the phase between turns after a (126:31 - 126:35)
player completes a turn you will enter (126:34 - 126:38)
the checkup phase you will check for (126:35 - 126:40)
special conditions in this order poison (126:38 - 126:42)
burned asleep and paralyzed you will (126:40 - 126:43)
check abilities that happen during the (126:42 - 126:47)
checkup phase it's pretty much just an (126:43 - 126:49)
extra step to make sure everyone's doing (126:47 - 126:52)
what they should be doing they've (126:49 - 126:55)
changed some regulation marks they've (126:52 - 126:58)
changed some text removal reminders of (126:55 - 127:02)
like hey make sure you check if it says (126:58 - 127:04)
before you attack or after you attack or (127:02 - 127:07)
they will probably start writing cards (127:04 - 127:10)
with during the check up phase on them (127:07 - 127:12)
in black and white they started using (127:10 - 127:15)
the term heal for example it would say (127:12 - 127:17)
heal 30 damage from your Pokemon prior (127:15 - 127:19)
to that it would say remove 30 damage (127:17 - 127:20)
count of 3 damage counters from your (127:19 - 127:22)
Pokemon in sword and shield a similar (127:20 - 127:25)
term will be introduced going forward (127:22 - 127:28)
this term will be called recover so the (127:25 - 127:31)
pokémon center lady has been updated in (127:28 - 127:32)
sort and shield to say heal 60 damage (127:31 - 127:34)
from one of your Pokemon and it will (127:32 - 127:36)
recover all special conditions it will (127:34 - 127:37)
still have the same effect but it does (127:36 - 127:38)
not recover (127:37 - 127:42)
renamed as recover yeah big changes very (127:38 - 127:45)
very unexpected I think very positive (127:42 - 127:49)
changes but we'll see (127:45 - 127:51)
there's a bunch of Pokemon good news new (127:49 - 127:53)
Pokemon got added to Pokemon girl we'll (127:51 - 127:55)

the dlc and given what we've seen so far (128:46 - 128:51)
what would you like to see in the dlc (128:49 - 128:53)
that has not been seen an actual (128:51 - 128:56)
storyline (128:53 - 128:56)
like how good a star we talking like (128:59 - 129:04)
rainbow rocket or better than that um I (129:01 - 129:08)
would so if there's something as like (129:04 - 129:10)
rainbow rocket actually had a fairly (129:08 - 129:13)
okay story like but they just sort of (129:10 - 129:16)
like stopped it I would like to see like (129:13 - 129:20)
a similar storyline along those but you (129:16 - 129:23)

Sonia to find more answers like if I get (129:54 - 129:59)
five hours of that and each like hey we (129:57 - 130:01)

know the king Pokemon and this is how (130:01 - 130:04)
this changes everything (130:03 - 130:06)
like if I got five hours of story line (130:04 - 130:08)
that sort of tied off a lot of those and (130:06 - 130:13)
ends I'd be happy well what do you what (130:08 - 130:15)
do you want ability to change my (130:13 - 130:22)
pokeballs two different pokeballs hmm I (130:15 - 130:26)
don't know I mean there's so much that (130:22 - 130:28)
this game can do for me at this point (130:26 - 130:33)
still that the the field is open you (130:28 - 130:35)
know I'm just I'm just looking for an (130:33 - 130:36)
enjoyable adventure (130:35 - 130:40)
maybe I mean I would say contests (130:36 - 130:42)
you know once again something different (130:40 - 130:43)
a different way to compete that's not (130:42 - 130:45)
battling but hobby I don't think we're (130:43 - 130:48)
going to see that so (130:45 - 130:48)
I would like to also see like maybe (130:48 - 130:54)
Morden brand-new Pokemon - that'd be (130:51 - 130:58)
good yeah yeah like more glaring forms (130:54 - 131:00)
or more actual just cooler in Pokemon (130:58 - 131:02)
like we're getting we got a hints of a (131:00 - 131:05)
few of that but if there are like five (131:02 - 131:07)
more to the Pokedex I would be probably (131:05 - 131:09)
happy with that - yeah what do you want (131:07 - 131:12)
Steve uh I was I was serious I've (131:09 - 131:13)
mentioned earlier I was serious about (131:12 - 131:16)
like a reverse bottle cap the mints the (131:13 - 131:19)
bottle caps like they've made everything (131:16 - 131:22)
easy for breeding like they are that is (131:19 - 131:25)
true that you could find it max ten raid (131:22 - 131:28)
four muds Dale catch said muds Dale (131:25 - 131:31)
level it pretty easily with candy give (131:28 - 131:32)
it a mint if it's the wrong nature and (131:31 - 131:34)
then bottle cap what you need to and (131:32 - 131:35)
it's good to go and that is super fast (131:34 - 131:39)
and probably what people want but you (131:35 - 131:42)
cannot do that at all if you're making a (131:39 - 131:45)
trick room team there's just like having (131:42 - 131:48)
thirty-one in having perfect speeds that (131:45 - 131:51)
is the opposite of what you want and if (131:48 - 131:54)
it was a if it was like even if you (131:51 - 131:56)
weren't running a trick room team like (131:54 - 132:00)
having a thirty one in in physical (131:56 - 132:04)
attack on a Chandeleur is not great one (132:00 - 132:06)
because you're not going to use it and (132:04 - 132:08)
two you're probably going to get foul (132:06 - 132:10)
played which is a very popular dark type (132:08 - 132:12)
move that is used in competitive and (132:10 - 132:16)
foul play is based off of your physical (132:12 - 132:18)
attack so Chandeleur with a high (132:16 - 132:21)
physical attack is there's like a (132:18 - 132:23)
difference between foul play killing you (132:21 - 132:25)
in two turns and foul play killing you (132:23 - 132:30)
in three turns so they've made it easy (132:25 - 132:34)
to get competitive Pokemon already (132:30 - 132:38)
unless you were dependent on having slow (132:34 - 132:40)
Pokemon and there is a reason why you (132:38 - 132:42)
would want Pokemon to be slow besides (132:40 - 132:45)
trick room or to have a lower attack (132:42 - 132:48)
because even if your attack was high (132:45 - 132:49)
that would mean you would take more (132:48 - 132:51)
confusion damage so again any like (132:49 - 132:53)
special Pokemon does not need a high (132:51 - 132:56)
attack just because of confusing being a (132:53 - 132:59)
status condition so if they had a bottle (132:56 - 133:02)
cap that made a major IVs zero (132:59 - 133:07)
I think that would be the final tool for (133:02 - 133:09)
somebody building competitive things I (133:07 - 133:11)
don't know if I'm missing anything else (133:09 - 133:15)
it would be very nice to have a shiny (133:11 - 133:18)
hunty a new shiny hunting method (133:15 - 133:21)
in the game I don't know if they would (133:18 - 133:23)
be so bold to do that I think that the (133:21 - 133:27)
shiny hunting in this game is (133:23 - 133:30)
I talked about this before on Twitch but (133:27 - 133:34)
when I'm shiny hunting in this game all (133:30 - 133:36)
shiny hunting is boring let me get that (133:34 - 133:40)
out of the way i I just feel like I wish (133:36 - 133:42)
I was doing something else because the (133:40 - 133:44)
other things to do in sword and shield (133:42 - 133:47)
are more fun like when everyone recently (133:44 - 133:49)
this past week was getting different (133:47 - 133:53)
flavors of alchemy I was like man that (133:49 - 133:57)
seems way more fun than to be riding my (133:53 - 134:01)
bike in a circle or knocking out 500 mer (133:57 - 134:07)
actus I do like the fact that the knock (134:01 - 134:11)
out the catch method (134:07 - 134:14)
rewards you permanently and I think with (134:11 - 134:16)
Pokemon games it's always a marathon not (134:14 - 134:17)
a sprint (134:16 - 134:21)
so if you're knocking out you know 30 (134:17 - 134:25)
Crammer ants a day within two months (134:21 - 134:27)
your Krammer ants shiny chance will be (134:25 - 134:30)
permanent forever and you will probably (134:27 - 134:32)
run into one cry moraine a day in the (134:30 - 134:36)
future so I do like that I just think (134:32 - 134:40)
the I just think that method is is it (134:36 - 134:42)
will be more rewarding in six months (134:40 - 134:45)
than it is right now and so to give (134:42 - 134:48)
players maybe something else like a (134:45 - 134:52)
third option would be kind of nice (134:48 - 134:52)
I think I don't think it's a fault to (134:53 - 134:56)
the shining hunting in the game I think (134:55 - 134:58)
shiny hunting is always inherently (134:56 - 135:01)
boring I just think that sword and (134:58 - 135:05)
shield has done a good job of making you (135:01 - 135:08)
care about other things (135:05 - 135:11)
like hey we promoted Pokemon this week (135:08 - 135:12)
in max raid dens maybe you should do (135:11 - 135:15)
them or hey we're starting a new gallery (135:12 - 135:17)
tournament at the end of this week or (135:15 - 135:18)
hey season 2 started and you can earn (135:17 - 135:22)
bottlecaps by participating I think it's (135:18 - 135:25)
done a very good job of doing that and I (135:22 - 135:27)
think it's gonna do a very good job in (135:25 - 135:29)
June where it's like hey we have a whole (135:27 - 135:32)
new area for you to explore are you sure (135:29 - 135:33)
you want to spin in a circle for over (135:32 - 135:37)
the next five days hatching eggs so that (135:33 - 135:39)
that's what I think I would like to see (135:37 - 135:42)
are they yeah bottle caps and maybe like (135:39 - 135:44)
a new shiny hunting method in in the (135:42 - 135:48)
game will Pokemon of the week alright (135:44 - 135:50)
last week spoke amount of the week it (135:48 - 135:53)
was a poem I'll read it again in the (135:50 - 135:55)
matter of finding our Pokemon creatures (135:53 - 135:57)
particular aspects we must reconcile (135:55 - 136:00)
their name their species abilities quite (135:57 - 136:01)
surely but also their route where they (136:00 - 136:05)
domicile and you Nova on 4 and 18 if (136:01 - 136:06)
you're lucky you'll see this week's (136:05 - 136:09)
eating a yeah Papa berry in Kalos in (136:06 - 136:11)
hordes on route 5 there are many (136:09 - 136:13)
practicing to intimidate to appear very (136:11 - 136:16)
scary on our return to Hoenn we (136:13 - 136:19)
travelled quite far to 1:13 and then we (136:16 - 136:21)
must look very closely this week's (136:19 - 136:23)
Pokemon can only be found if it peeks (136:21 - 136:26)
out its head perhaps to be nosy while (136:23 - 136:28)
visiting a Lola our first trip no dice (136:26 - 136:31)
yet on our return without too much luck (136:28 - 136:33)
we discovered some boys before the red (136:31 - 136:35)
meadow and some girls near the town with (136:33 - 136:38)
a broken-down truck grand gala with its (136:35 - 136:40)
castles its curries its camps appears to (136:38 - 136:43)
have two routes we can place the mystery (136:40 - 136:46)
pokémon moto Stoke outskirts is one and (136:43 - 136:49)
Galler mind number two it does grace one (136:46 - 136:51)
last bit of advice if he would be so (136:49 - 136:53)
keen to find a species member with the (136:51 - 136:56)
ability stated travel to the wild area (136:53 - 136:59)
peer into a den if it's in a max raid (136:56 - 137:02)
you'll be quite elated alright who's (136:59 - 137:03)
that so easy (137:02 - 137:04)
who's the pokey (137:03 - 137:08)
[Laughter] (137:04 - 137:14)
it's scolipede well you got part of it (137:08 - 137:15)
right (137:14 - 137:19)
it's scraggy its scraggy (137:15 - 137:25)
scolipede is not even in as far as I (137:19 - 137:28)
know no it's that (137:25 - 137:32)
well not yet not yet for 30 bucks though (137:28 - 137:35)
maybe ya behind the paywall you'll get (137:32 - 137:41)
it scraggy has no trivia about it it was (137:35 - 137:44)
- that is right Percy based on a sort of (137:41 - 137:47)
lizard in addition with (137:44 - 137:47)
cranky since it encapsulates stereotypes (137:48 - 137:54)
of youth subcultures and I particularly (137:51 - 137:59)
hip-hop or punk hmm (137:54 - 138:02)
got the Mohawk (137:59 - 138:04)
- did have a scraggy (138:02 - 138:07)
it has grown yes Maggie it always used (138:04 - 138:09)
to hit its head on things it was very (138:07 - 138:11)
cute (138:09 - 138:14)
chef alai comes pretty good I honestly (138:11 - 138:17)
can't tell the difference between the (138:14 - 138:19)
shiny (138:17 - 138:19)
oh it's one of those is it yeah and look (138:19 - 138:25)
oh it's is it just that it's a slightly (138:23 - 138:28)
darker orange yeah it's it's (138:25 - 138:30)
it's pretty obvious in certain shield (138:28 - 138:33)
the 3ds had been very bad color (138:30 - 138:37)
differences true yeah that's a lot (138:33 - 138:41)
darker okay will I guess okay next (138:37 - 138:44)
week's something a little different for (138:41 - 138:47)
you although I'll be in Texas next week (138:44 - 138:48)
so if people are gonna have two weeks to (138:47 - 138:51)
chew on this one previous to science (138:48 - 138:52)
identifying that we live in a (138:51 - 138:55)
deterministic universe the ancients (138:52 - 138:57)
believed that gods or demigods set out (138:55 - 139:00)
the path that human lives would take the (138:57 - 139:02)
apportion errs in Greece Clotho Lachesis (139:00 - 139:06)
and atropos or the scandinavian Dorn's (139:02 - 139:09)
for example you roar Varane tea and (139:06 - 139:12)
scold bird on D I'm sorry mispronounced (139:09 - 139:14)
that one an indo-european descent in (139:12 - 139:16)
cultures fates are typically represented (139:14 - 139:20)
as three there is a resident of an East (139:16 - 139:22)
our city that frequently speaks of fate (139:20 - 139:26)
in video game manga and anime alike they (139:22 - 139:29)
frequently speak of what is to come as a (139:26 - 139:31)
warning so that hopefully the foreseen (139:29 - 139:33)
can be changed they also present a (139:31 - 139:34)
Trinity (139:33 - 139:38)
sigilyph with the MIT with the ability (139:34 - 139:41)
magic guard Slowking with the ability (139:38 - 139:45)
oblivious and meowstic female with the (139:41 - 139:48)
ability infiltrator while anistar city (139:45 - 139:51)
is known for its large sundial this (139:48 - 139:53)
week's individual is known for two items (139:51 - 139:56)
first they wear a cloak with a (139:53 - 139:58)
star-filled pattern print a zero-gravity (139:56 - 140:02)
is set to promote psychic power second (139:58 - 140:04)
they have a bracelet large enough for (140:02 - 140:06)
two wrists it has been said that if you (140:04 - 140:08)
place your wrist within this bracelet (140:06 - 140:10)
our individual can see what your future (140:08 - 140:13)
holds in store in the strange twisting (140:10 - 140:15)
of time that occurred around the mega (140:13 - 140:17)
evolution special they were able to (140:15 - 140:20)
prepare Kalos for the potential calamity (140:17 - 140:22)
of the battle between primal Groudon and (140:20 - 140:25)
primal Kyogre they also had insight into (140:22 - 140:27)
the eventual disposition of squishy (140:25 - 140:30)
before the series completion (140:27 - 140:32)
in the TCG this individual has a card (140:30 - 140:34)
that works much like the card switch (140:32 - 140:37)
except it also heals the benched pokémon (140:34 - 140:41)
for 30 see I used heals like we did in (140:37 - 140:44)
back on white days mmm alright that's it (140:41 - 140:49)

yeah it didn't work (141:00 - 141:04)
that's okay though we'll be back next (141:03 - 141:09)

podcast to go on YouTube we've done this (141:12 - 141:17)
song and dance before I actually looked (141:15 - 141:19)
at my youtube earlier and I was like oh (141:17 - 141:21)
wow I uploaded a lot of episodes on (141:19 - 141:24)
YouTube a long time ago and then stopped (141:21 - 141:26)
