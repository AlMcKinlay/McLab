[Music] (0:02 - 0:13)
[Applause] (0:12 - 0:23)
[Music] (0:13 - 0:26)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:30)
516th episode of the pokemon podcast (0:26 - 0:32)
it's super effective i'm your host steve (0:30 - 0:35)
with me is will i have (0:32 - 0:37)
you switching things up on me again i'm (0:35 - 0:41)
i'm not prepared i got nothing (0:37 - 0:41)
yeah this is a very nothing podcast we (0:41 - 0:44)
have nothing to talk about this week i (0:43 - 0:46)
mean we got plenty to talk about but you (0:44 - 0:48)
can't like at the last minute expect me (0:46 - 0:50)
to have some witty repartee (0:48 - 0:53)
with two hours notice i gotta plan these (0:50 - 0:55)
things out ahead of time because it's (0:53 - 0:57)
2022. you never know what word's going (0:55 - 0:58)
to come out of your mouth and offend (0:57 - 1:00)
five million people that's true we're (0:58 - 1:03)
recording on friday because go fest is (1:00 - 1:06)
is uh saturday sunday and we opted (1:03 - 1:08)
you know i said last week i was like (1:06 - 1:10)
they're probably hold on greg is here (1:08 - 1:12)
am i i mean you can just skip over me (1:10 - 1:14)
apparently (1:12 - 1:16)
apparently i don't matter anymore it's (1:14 - 1:17)
fine (1:16 - 1:19)
i'll just sit over here (1:17 - 1:21)
quiet (1:19 - 1:23)
unloved he probably had something (1:21 - 1:24)
planned i (1:23 - 1:27)
did not anymore (1:24 - 1:28)
no well i had (1:27 - 1:32)
go fest for this episode planned (1:28 - 1:34)
and i was like i literally said last i (1:32 - 1:36)
haven't even bought my ticket yet yeah (1:34 - 1:38)
me either i'm holding out for niantic to (1:36 - 1:40)
come through with a free one (1:38 - 1:42)
i i said on last week's episode they (1:40 - 1:44)
probably won't announce any of scarlet (1:42 - 1:46)
violet because they want to focus on go (1:44 - 1:47)
fest and they'll probably announce this (1:46 - 1:50)
garland violet after go fest and you and (1:47 - 1:54)
janine and her calendar was like nope (1:50 - 1:55)
everything which means we'll probably (1:54 - 1:57)
get nothing next week it's gonna be (1:55 - 2:00)
radio silent next week look janine works (1:57 - 2:02)
one week a month (2:00 - 2:04)
and she has to have everything done that (2:02 - 2:06)
one week (2:04 - 2:08)
anything outside of that is your problem (2:06 - 2:10)
not hers (2:08 - 2:13)
so i think what we'll do is uh (2:10 - 2:16)
probably do like a a bonus podcast for (2:13 - 2:18)
patrons and and uh apple plus subscriber (2:16 - 2:20)
apple podcast subscription i don't know (2:18 - 2:22)
what they're called apple apple (2:20 - 2:25)
subscribers uh for go fest i'm sure i'll (2:22 - 2:27)
grab bobby and something i'll make bobby (2:25 - 2:28)
talk for an hour (2:27 - 2:31)
you guys can pay to hear bobby (2:28 - 2:33)
um (2:31 - 2:35)
that way uh will and greg can have (2:33 - 2:37)
somewhat of a weekend and they don't (2:35 - 2:38)
have to put up with me for eight hours (2:37 - 2:41)
each day and then also record with me (2:38 - 2:44)
they i know they have a bold assumption (2:41 - 2:45)
that we're going to put up with you for (2:44 - 2:46)
eight hours (2:45 - 2:48)
as well i do believe my description of (2:46 - 2:50)
the day was i'm going to bike there play (2:48 - 2:52)
go and then adios (2:50 - 2:55)
that's true (2:52 - 2:57)
there's a lot of assumptions that have (2:55 - 2:59)
just happened in a very short amount of (2:57 - 3:00)
time (2:59 - 3:02)
um (3:00 - 3:03)
so (3:02 - 3:04)
i guess let's just get into it we're (3:03 - 3:06)
gonna pretty much spend the entire (3:04 - 3:07)
episode talking about the scarlet and (3:06 - 3:09)
violet trailer it was three i guess i (3:07 - 3:12)
should watch that you haven't watched it (3:09 - 3:15)
no he's watched it so how this podcast (3:12 - 3:17)
works if you're new here hello uh for (3:15 - 3:19)
every one minute a trailer is we spend (3:17 - 3:21)
about 30 minutes talking about it so we (3:19 - 3:23)
have to hit our 90-minute quota for the (3:21 - 3:25)
three minutes that was that trailer okay (3:23 - 3:27)
question number one (3:25 - 3:29)
okay cool (3:27 - 3:32)
no i was making sure that the release (3:29 - 3:33)
date (3:32 - 3:36)
matched up with my planned week of (3:33 - 3:38)
vacation at thanksgiving and it does so (3:36 - 3:40)
we can start there at the top of the (3:38 - 3:45)
list arriving november 18th 2022 (3:40 - 3:48)
that's correct that is that is the the (3:45 - 3:50)
pokemon company international nintendo (3:48 - 3:51)
shared that scarlett and violet will (3:50 - 3:53)
launch on november 18th (3:51 - 3:55)
uh digital pre-orders are available in (3:53 - 3:57)
the e-shop today (3:55 - 4:00)
they also revealed the cover art (3:57 - 4:04)
yeah um they revealed multiplayer (4:00 - 4:06)
uh but let's let's skip those two things (4:04 - 4:08)
first and let's go right into the what (4:06 - 4:10)
they opened the trailer with which was (4:08 - 4:13)
the new professors also i'll probably (4:10 - 4:16)
insert the news music here (4:13 - 4:16)
and (4:16 - 4:20)
we have professor asada and professor (4:17 - 4:22)
turo um i think i'm saying those right (4:20 - 4:23)
yeah (4:22 - 4:26)
for the first time one of two different (4:23 - 4:27)
professors will appear in the game (4:26 - 4:29)
depending on what version players choose (4:27 - 4:31)
and scarlet players will meet professor (4:29 - 4:34)
sada and pokemon violet players will (4:31 - 4:36)
meet professor turo each professor is (4:34 - 4:38)
carrying out research into lore (4:36 - 4:41)
passed down into read the region which (4:38 - 4:44)
we do not know the region name yet (4:41 - 4:45)
either (4:44 - 4:47)
risotto (4:45 - 4:49)
yep (4:47 - 4:49)
[Music] (4:51 - 4:56)
uh so sada derives from past turo comes (4:53 - 4:58)
from future (4:56 - 5:00)
yeah that was uh don't don't worry i've (4:58 - 5:02)
had uh multiple people come in my twitch (5:00 - 5:05)
chat and tell me that fun fact that was (5:02 - 5:07)
unpacked (5:05 - 5:10)
if you if anyone wants to go back and (5:07 - 5:12)
listen to when they did the original (5:10 - 5:14)
announcement i'm pretty sure that's what (5:12 - 5:17)
will anderson said it is i i said that (5:14 - 5:18)
when when (5:17 - 5:20)
so you let's say you don't understand (5:18 - 5:25)

explorer i think my spanish is pretty (5:35 - 5:40)
good let's explore steve (5:37 - 5:42)
let's let's say you you didn't look at (5:40 - 5:44)
their names you could just look at their (5:42 - 5:47)
outfits uh professor sada has like i (5:44 - 5:49)
would say like a jurassic (5:47 - 5:52)
ish prehistoric outfit on (5:49 - 5:54)
and then uh professor turo has a very (5:52 - 5:57)
like tron futuristic outfit (5:54 - 5:59)
i need this tron outfit so if there's (5:57 - 6:02)
costume makers out there that are like (5:59 - 6:04)

torn launch shorts i mean they're (6:13 - 6:18)
definitely shorts (6:16 - 6:20)
or a squirt it could be a scorp but yeah (6:18 - 6:21)
i mean we're not gonna go that far in (6:20 - 6:24)
the past are we (6:21 - 6:27)
uh people still wear squirts today greg (6:24 - 6:28)
they shouldn't speak (6:27 - 6:31)
catholic school students (6:28 - 6:33)
the actual trivia here is i believe (6:31 - 6:34)
these are the first two professors that (6:33 - 6:37)
don't have trees yeah let's talk about (6:34 - 6:39)
the tree tragedy let's talk about how (6:37 - 6:41)
bad the trees have gotten that they are (6:39 - 6:43)
no longer naming professors are you sure (6:41 - 6:45)
you can't find a single tree in this (6:43 - 6:49)
entire world court called sada or i have (6:45 - 6:52)
looked kudo i have looked for those as (6:49 - 6:55)
trees and it came up as nothing what (6:52 - 6:57)
about what about (6:55 - 6:59)
it (6:57 - 6:59)
isn't turo like a lawnmower though (7:00 - 7:05)
that's toro (7:02 - 7:05)
i can take you to the factory (7:06 - 7:10)
um (7:08 - 7:12)

billingsworth (7:16 - 7:20)
i can't remember what her name is i it (7:18 - 7:22)
will come to be (7:20 - 7:25)
there's also a professor in unite is (7:22 - 7:27)
there not i'm trying to remember there (7:25 - 7:29)
is a professor in unite you never see (7:27 - 7:31)
this person (7:29 - 7:33)
yeah but we know that unite is based on (7:31 - 7:34)
uh (7:33 - 7:36)
gosh what is the region called of unite (7:34 - 7:38)
i can't remember now (7:36 - 7:42)
it's professor bellas united (7:38 - 7:44)
no eos is the (7:42 - 7:47)
oh is it aos no aos is the gems (7:44 - 7:50)
aeos region (7:47 - 7:53)
do you not watch the unite anime (7:50 - 7:56)
yeah my mistake uh bellis is a (7:53 - 7:58)
flowering plant so it is still (7:56 - 8:01)
plant-based okay who who is the (7:58 - 8:04)
professor for eos they exist (8:01 - 8:08)
i'm pretty sure he's black isn't he (8:04 - 8:10)
i remember like he kind of looks like uh (8:08 - 8:14)
the dude from overwatch (8:10 - 8:14)
uh he's a very happy institute is (8:14 - 8:21)
researcher irby (8:18 - 8:21)
professor forrest (8:21 - 8:26)
yeah professor forrest is oh he's just (8:23 - 8:28)
straight up named professor forrest (8:26 - 8:33)
no forest like phosphorus p-h-o-e-r oh (8:28 - 8:35)
okay okay got it which is the whole sort (8:33 - 8:38)
of glowy (8:35 - 8:42)
that's not a tree (8:38 - 8:42)
trees aside i i think like (8:47 - 8:51)
it's cool they're doing two professors (8:49 - 8:54)
i'm super into it it i i don't know i (8:51 - 8:58)
would just there are phosphorus trees so (8:54 - 9:00)
oh there are prosperous trees yeah okay (8:58 - 9:01)
all right (9:00 - 9:05)
i i would i would imagine that (9:01 - 9:05)
okay number one i have i have so many (9:06 - 9:09)
thoughts number one it still blows my (9:07 - 9:11)
mind that legends was only one game and (9:09 - 9:13)
they didn't sell us two games they could (9:11 - 9:15)
have like literally just put move past (9:13 - 9:17)
five pokemon each (9:15 - 9:20)
no no number two they did legends arceus (9:17 - 9:23)
the way they did it right (9:20 - 9:26)
and they were like we're in we're out (9:23 - 9:29)
it was a perfect scenario they didn't (9:26 - 9:31)
need to sell us to if you looked at like (9:29 - 9:33)
past games right like let's say let's (9:31 - 9:35)
say you looked at um (9:33 - 9:37)
gold and silver (9:35 - 9:39)
diamond and pearl (9:37 - 9:40)
x and y (9:39 - 9:42)
sun and moon i'm skipping certain games (9:40 - 9:44)
for a reason (9:42 - 9:47)
you they they barely did anything (9:44 - 9:49)
and they sold us two identical versions (9:47 - 9:51)
of the same game did i say red and blue (9:49 - 9:53)
and they've been doing this for years (9:51 - 9:55)
and a little bit (9:53 - 9:58)
like in in sword and shield they're like (9:55 - 10:00)
hey we got two different gym leaders (9:58 - 10:02)
although i don't think a casual fan is (10:00 - 10:04)
going to be like i really know i really (10:02 - 10:06)
need to know what aleister was doing (10:04 - 10:08)
over in that game like i don't i don't (10:06 - 10:10)
think you had two different gym leaders (10:08 - 10:12)
in unova dude (10:10 - 10:12)
yeah (10:12 - 10:15)
i'm going backwards okay so like unova (10:12 - 10:16)
also had two different gym leaders but (10:15 - 10:18)
they also had two different just (10:16 - 10:19)
straight up cities (10:18 - 10:21)
one game had white forest the other game (10:19 - 10:23)
had black city but again i don't think (10:21 - 10:26)
that was ever enough to be like oh you (10:23 - 10:27)
need to buy the other game and i think (10:26 - 10:30)
that's like a double-edged sword right (10:27 - 10:32)
i don't think you should i don't think (10:30 - 10:34)
gamefreak is thinking (10:32 - 10:35)
like oh (10:34 - 10:37)
this one town is enough to convince (10:35 - 10:39)
somebody to spend another 40 or 60 (10:37 - 10:40)
dollars (10:39 - 10:43)
but it's a nice like differentiating (10:40 - 10:44)
feature (10:43 - 10:46)
but at the same time like the person who (10:44 - 10:49)
does buy both it's it doesn't feel like (10:46 - 10:51)
it's like justified it's like this weird (10:49 - 10:53)
middle ground where it's like not enough (10:51 - 10:55)
for either person (10:53 - 10:56)
um (10:55 - 10:58)
and then for (10:56 - 10:59)
ruby and sapphire (10:58 - 11:02)
instead of towns or gym leaders it's (10:59 - 11:04)
it's the bad team but again (11:02 - 11:06)
not enough like their dialogue is almost (11:04 - 11:08)
exactly the same it's just one they just (11:06 - 11:10)
replace the word kyogre with grout um (11:08 - 11:12)
and you're you're fine and land with (11:10 - 11:14)
their their motives were completely (11:12 - 11:16)
different one wanted to expand the water (11:14 - 11:19)
one would expand the ground they they (11:16 - 11:22)
that was not a cut and pace job swap out (11:19 - 11:23)
land and water (11:22 - 11:26)
nah they had completely different goals (11:23 - 11:28)
they were completely different people (11:26 - 11:31)
one was a big buff sailor the other was (11:28 - 11:35)
uh a freight slim stylish land lover (11:31 - 11:36)
like (11:35 - 11:39)
night and day how dare you come at gen (11:36 - 11:42)
3. how dare you so i i do i i do (11:39 - 11:44)
probably lean (11:42 - 11:46)
into like (11:44 - 11:48)
sada and toro are are not enough to (11:46 - 11:50)
convince people like oh you need to (11:48 - 11:51)
experience both (11:50 - 11:54)
i think like (11:51 - 11:54)
no i also think much like in gen 3 you (11:54 - 12:00)
will see sata (11:58 - 12:01)
as the (12:00 - 12:04)
rival school or whatever (12:01 - 12:06)
like they'll be there you just don't (12:04 - 12:10)
report to them (12:06 - 12:10)
oh do you think this is like (12:11 - 12:14)
the two professors are in like the (12:13 - 12:17)
orange school or the grape school and (12:14 - 12:19)
like they're being like these books are (12:17 - 12:22)
banned so we're teaching you these books (12:19 - 12:24)
yep (12:22 - 12:28)
i mean there's there's the weird (12:24 - 12:30)
twitter exchange that happened today too (12:28 - 12:32)
that's fueling my speculation oh i (12:30 - 12:35)
haven't seen that (12:32 - 12:36)
go on (12:35 - 12:40)
uh there was a person that posted (12:36 - 12:42)
the picture of the two professors (12:40 - 12:46)
and said who are these two wrong answers (12:42 - 12:49)
only and the official pokemon channel (12:46 - 12:53)
replied their professors (12:49 - 12:53)
why is that weird because it was (12:54 - 12:58)
supposed to be wrong answers only it's (12:56 - 12:59)
always like (12:58 - 13:01)
did they just say that they're is that (12:59 - 13:03)
like their subtle way of saying they're (13:01 - 13:05)
more than just professors in these (13:03 - 13:07)
professors (13:05 - 13:09)
maybe it's the question mark that makes (13:07 - 13:11)
it the wrong answer yeah it's (13:09 - 13:14)
well it feels like he's not like a real (13:11 - 13:15)
professor either (13:14 - 13:17)
what do you mean kakui researches (13:15 - 13:20)
pokemon attacks yeah yeah but kakui is (13:17 - 13:24)
like he like (13:20 - 13:24)
he was he wanted to be a trainer and he (13:24 - 13:30)
he became he only became a professor to (13:27 - 13:32)
then build the elite four so that he (13:30 - 13:34)
could be the champion of it i wanted to (13:32 - 13:36)
work for the state department and be a (13:34 - 13:38)
diplomat around the world and yet here i (13:36 - 13:40)
am sitting in minneapolis recording a (13:38 - 13:43)
pokemon podcast i wanted to be an actor (13:40 - 13:45)
and i'm stuck on this program does that (13:43 - 13:47)
make me not a podcaster (13:45 - 13:49)
how did this show become so negative (13:47 - 13:52)
jeez (13:49 - 13:52)
you're like oh these people aren't what (13:52 - 13:55)
they say all i'm saying is you're the (13:54 - 13:57)
one that brought up they said they (13:55 - 13:58)
aren't what they are i thought they were (13:57 - 14:00)
professors that was the pro that was the (13:58 - 14:02)
pokemon company tweeting (14:00 - 14:05)
the wrong answer is that they're pokemon (14:02 - 14:07)
the english one or the uk one the (14:05 - 14:09)
english one they probably misunderstood (14:07 - 14:10)
the (14:09 - 14:12)
question who tweeted who made the tweet (14:10 - 14:15)
was it like a big person it was from the (14:12 - 14:19)
pokemon official no no no (14:15 - 14:19)
was it just like was it just like a (14:19 - 14:24)
small nobody or was it like like ign or (14:21 - 14:26)
something no it was a small nobody if i (14:24 - 14:28)
remember correctly okay (14:26 - 14:29)
uh i'd have to look it up again i do (14:28 - 14:32)
disagree with greg my suspicion is that (14:29 - 14:33)
the games will be completely different (14:32 - 14:35)
and one will be very past oriented and (14:33 - 14:38)
one will be future oriented oh it came (14:35 - 14:39)
from tw the person that posted it was (14:38 - 14:41)
twitter gaming that has a million (14:39 - 14:43)
followers oh okay pokemon channel (14:41 - 14:45)
responded (14:43 - 14:47)
um they are pokemon professors question (14:45 - 14:50)
mark question mark question mark (14:47 - 14:50)
yeah i think it's just like no they are (14:50 - 14:54)
professors like very tongue-in-cheek i (14:52 - 14:57)
think that there's not an evil team and (14:54 - 14:59)
the rival school is the team that you're (14:57 - 15:01)
going up against (14:59 - 15:02)
and there's some sort of like i disagree (15:01 - 15:07)
with this running around like stuff (15:02 - 15:07)
no actually i don't disagree with this i (15:07 - 15:11)
heard that the evil team the specul well (15:09 - 15:12)
now that you said the school thing that (15:11 - 15:14)
makes more sense because i didn't think (15:12 - 15:15)
about like (15:14 - 15:18)
how this is like a real world problem (15:15 - 15:19)
spoiler (15:18 - 15:20)
uh (15:19 - 15:21)
pokemon games are usually based around (15:20 - 15:24)
real real world problems people just (15:21 - 15:27)
don't see that (15:24 - 15:27)
um (15:28 - 15:31)
so like the actual real world problem in (15:29 - 15:34)
sun and moon was like parents verbally (15:31 - 15:35)
abusing their kids (15:34 - 15:36)
uh (15:35 - 15:38)
or just like younger folks in general i (15:36 - 15:40)
mean not only is that the theme with (15:38 - 15:42)
lusamine and (15:40 - 15:45)
uh gladion and uh lily but that was a (15:42 - 15:47)
theme with guzma's parents yep and that (15:45 - 15:50)
was also a theme with (15:47 - 15:52)
somebody gosh who who's the other there (15:50 - 15:56)
was like a third person um (15:52 - 15:58)
family dynamics (15:56 - 15:59)
yeah (15:58 - 16:01)
plumeria also as well like plumeria oh (15:59 - 16:04)
yeah yeah yeah anyways (16:01 - 16:05)
um so (16:04 - 16:07)
now that you said the school stuff (16:05 - 16:10)
that makes it more believable at least (16:07 - 16:12)
in my head or more logical that like (16:10 - 16:14)
there's a real world problem of schools (16:12 - 16:18)
refusing to teach certain things (16:14 - 16:19)
and like these books are not allowed but (16:18 - 16:23)
these books are allowed so if the sada (16:19 - 16:24)
is like these are the books we're (16:23 - 16:26)
teaching and that which but that is like (16:24 - 16:28)
very (16:26 - 16:31)
um diamond and pearl of like (16:28 - 16:33)
not that man pro but probably closer to (16:31 - 16:35)
legends of like we believe this but no (16:33 - 16:37)
we believe this kind of thing (16:35 - 16:39)
i mean legends argus was uh treaties (16:37 - 16:42)
against religious extremism so like (16:39 - 16:44)
i don't know that they're going this far (16:42 - 16:46)
but like i i can definitely see like two (16:44 - 16:49)
schools pitted against each other (16:46 - 16:52)
um because that is a common like if (16:49 - 16:54)
you've been watching a lot of recent (16:52 - 16:56)
anime there's been a whole lot of number (16:54 - 16:58)
one school number two school and we have (16:56 - 17:00)
to show up number two school become (16:58 - 17:01)
number one school (17:00 - 17:03)
um that has shown up in a lot of new (17:01 - 17:06)
anime recently so it's in that culture (17:03 - 17:08)
so that's why i think that that there is (17:06 - 17:10)
a strong (17:08 - 17:12)
feeling that you'll go to the grape (17:10 - 17:15)
school and your rivals are the orange (17:12 - 17:17)
school and what they're doing like (17:15 - 17:18)
either you have to (17:17 - 17:20)
it's either like we're going to get the (17:18 - 17:22)
research first or we're going to prove (17:20 - 17:24)
that future tech is the right way or (17:22 - 17:26)
the past is the lessons we have to learn (17:24 - 17:27)
from or whatever but i i do have a (17:26 - 17:28)
strong (17:27 - 17:31)
rival schools feeling (17:28 - 17:33)
but that also if you think about so the (17:31 - 17:35)
the opposite what i saw on twitter that (17:33 - 17:37)
i was like oh yeah i guess that's fine (17:35 - 17:38)
it's like people were like oh the bad (17:37 - 17:40)
team is probably time travel or want (17:38 - 17:42)
time travel to happen either to the (17:40 - 17:43)
future to the pa (17:42 - 17:44)
to the past (17:43 - 17:45)
but (17:44 - 17:47)
that would make it (17:45 - 17:49)
more complicated and just of two schools (17:47 - 17:50)
being pit against each other because (17:49 - 17:53)
they have different learning styles yeah (17:50 - 17:54)
um also it (17:53 - 17:57)
the past focus of one of the schools (17:54 - 17:58)
makes (17:57 - 18:01)
the historian forms (17:58 - 18:04)
much more logical into this game (18:01 - 18:06)
since there is a person that is focused (18:04 - 18:09)
on the past and perhaps restoring past (18:06 - 18:11)
or discovering the past (18:09 - 18:13)
it makes sense that that (18:11 - 18:16)
either you can bring them in or there (18:13 - 18:20)
will be options to catch the hasuyan (18:16 - 18:22)
forms in this game as well (18:20 - 18:25)
well also in in the sense of like the (18:22 - 18:27)
game can still be (18:25 - 18:28)
when you when you start talking about (18:27 - 18:31)
past and future like (18:28 - 18:32)
oh how different are these games going (18:31 - 18:34)
to be (18:32 - 18:36)
but you can but you can still say like (18:34 - 18:38)
this person is just focused on teaching (18:36 - 18:40)
the past and this poke this person is (18:38 - 18:42)
just focused on teaching the future (18:40 - 18:44)
which that goes (18:42 - 18:47)
very much like black and white where (18:44 - 18:49)
one where the theme in black and white (18:47 - 18:51)
was we want to teach the truth (18:49 - 18:53)
or not teach or preach preach i think (18:51 - 18:55)
it's preached the truth (18:53 - 18:56)
and then the other game was we want to (18:55 - 18:58)
preach ideals well it's the conflict (18:56 - 19:01)
between truth and ideas truth and ideals (18:58 - 19:02)
yeah (19:01 - 19:04)
which the games i i would say didn't do (19:02 - 19:06)
a really good job of that (19:04 - 19:10)
the movie like did that like the movie (19:06 - 19:11)
focused on that but like the games did a (19:10 - 19:14)
really bad job of like truth and ideals (19:11 - 19:17)
i i did want to throw in um let's just (19:14 - 19:19)
lower our expectations we know the story (19:17 - 19:22)
is not going to be great (19:19 - 19:23)
we know it we know it's going to be (19:22 - 19:25)
really good until there's an elevator (19:23 - 19:27)
scene with really bad music and then (19:25 - 19:29)
you're like i got to fight (19:27 - 19:31)
right (19:29 - 19:32)
i would work at that company be like i (19:31 - 19:34)
could go battle kids on my lunch break (19:32 - 19:36)
hold on (19:34 - 19:36)
um (19:37 - 19:40)
okay we can we can circle back to the uh (19:38 - 19:44)
past and present and stuff but like (19:40 - 19:46)
but but i will reread what it says here (19:44 - 19:48)
each professor is carrying out research (19:46 - 19:51)
into lore passed down into the region (19:48 - 19:53)
so i do think (19:51 - 19:56)
that your guys's suggestion of the two (19:53 - 19:58)
schools being pit against (19:56 - 20:00)
each other is is logical and very (19:58 - 20:02)
grounded although possible it doesn't (20:00 - 20:03)
happen (20:02 - 20:05)
uh versus what i've seen on the internet (20:03 - 20:07)
which is like time travel (20:05 - 20:08)
explosions (20:07 - 20:11)
i've just figured it could happen i (20:08 - 20:13)
figured out what it is (20:11 - 20:16)
they discover in their school libraries (20:13 - 20:19)
the long forgotten (20:16 - 20:22)
tome book (20:19 - 20:23)
choose your own adventure the cave of (20:22 - 20:25)
time which is the first choose your own (20:23 - 20:27)
adventure book that's a great book too (20:25 - 20:30)
and they also have pokemon z hidden in (20:27 - 20:31)
there they go to (20:30 - 20:35)
hunt find the cave of time (20:31 - 20:36)
and one of them believes it'll take them (20:35 - 20:38)
to the past and the other ones will take (20:36 - 20:41)
them to the future i am into this (20:38 - 20:43)
also here's a question on the table that (20:41 - 20:45)
we can have to circle around again (20:43 - 20:47)
who's the third professor (20:45 - 20:49)
oh my gosh stop (20:47 - 20:51)
professor z (20:49 - 20:54)
professor gray (20:51 - 20:54)
uh (20:54 - 20:56)
nimona (20:57 - 21:01)
is it did i say that okay (20:59 - 21:03)
i mean they haven't said it but it could (21:01 - 21:05)
be either nimona (21:03 - 21:07)
okay nimona (21:05 - 21:10)
they haven't said it depends on is this (21:07 - 21:12)
a spanish name should i (21:10 - 21:15)
is this is this like is this okay so the (21:12 - 21:17)
first this is i'm gonna be really dumb (21:15 - 21:19)
i'm super sorry i have never heard the (21:17 - 21:21)
name bianca (21:19 - 21:23)
until black and white (21:21 - 21:25)
what yeah (21:23 - 21:28)
to be fair though i was like what 20 (21:25 - 21:32)
20 years old and very sheltered (21:28 - 21:34)
got that right yeah (21:32 - 21:37)
but then i i have now known probably (21:34 - 21:39)
five or six people named bianca (21:37 - 21:41)
so is this another situation like there (21:39 - 21:43)
are people out there named nimona i just (21:41 - 21:45)
never met them or is this like a not (21:43 - 21:45)
like (21:45 - 21:48)
those aren't made up particularly common (21:45 - 21:50)
name (21:48 - 21:52)
bianca is a common name yes it means (21:50 - 21:53)
white (21:52 - 21:54)
yes (21:53 - 21:57)
it's the same as same as blanche or (21:54 - 22:00)
blanche (21:57 - 22:00)
of each other (22:01 - 22:03)
so on my name database that i use for (22:06 - 22:11)
role-playing things uh pneumona does not (22:08 - 22:15)
appear as an existing name in this list (22:11 - 22:18)
the only thing i can find is (22:15 - 22:20)
babynames.com (22:18 - 22:23)
behindthename.com (22:20 - 22:23)
there is an indian recipe (22:24 - 22:29)
for something called nimona that i found (22:26 - 22:32)
um but it does not it it does not have a (22:29 - 22:36)
history that i am aware of (22:32 - 22:36)
i mean even even ryhon was on (22:36 - 22:42)
babynames.com correct (22:38 - 22:42)
uh (22:43 - 22:48)
nimona has a sunny energetic disposition (22:45 - 22:51)
and is passionate about pokemon battles (22:48 - 22:52)
she's an experienced pokemon trainer and (22:51 - 22:55)
serves as a friend and a reliable guide (22:52 - 22:57)
for players on their adventure (22:55 - 22:59)
on their journeys (22:57 - 23:02)
oh sorry uh no no this this still works (22:59 - 23:03)
on their journeys players will encounter (23:02 - 23:06)
never before seen pokemon whoa (23:03 - 23:08)
among them the uh there are three (23:06 - 23:11)
that nimona uses on her team and we'll (23:08 - 23:13)
get to those in a second (23:11 - 23:14)
uh but the three pokemon they show in (23:13 - 23:18)
the trailer are three of her pokemon (23:14 - 23:18)
confused (23:18 - 23:23)
by the fact that they have to point out (23:21 - 23:27)
in her description on the website (23:23 - 23:28)
it (23:27 - 23:30)
it does also seem that she's not the (23:28 - 23:33)
best at throwing pokeballs (23:30 - 23:34)
yeah (23:33 - 23:38)
which that line reminded me of in sun (23:34 - 23:41)
and moon where you could go to the guy (23:38 - 23:43)
that was in charge of the garbage (23:41 - 23:45)
disposal yeah and he would teach you (23:43 - 23:47)
like eight different ways to throw a (23:45 - 23:49)
pokeball i did (23:47 - 23:51)
maybe i blew somebody's mind because (23:49 - 23:52)
maybe somebody didn't realize that was a (23:51 - 23:54)
thing but in sun and moon you could (23:52 - 23:56)
change how you threw a pokeball which (23:54 - 23:57)
was like (23:56 - 24:00)
it was like novel um but there was like (23:57 - 24:01)
there was probably one that you liked (24:00 - 24:03)
more than others (24:01 - 24:04)
i forgot how you unlocked it though you (24:03 - 24:06)
couldn't unlock them all right away i (24:04 - 24:07)
think you had to battle them like once a (24:06 - 24:09)
day there were achievements and things (24:07 - 24:10)
you had to do um what this makes me (24:09 - 24:12)
think of is (24:10 - 24:14)
it's it's gonna be like legends arceus (24:12 - 24:17)
and she's gonna be like i'm having (24:14 - 24:18)
trouble throwing a pokeball at this (24:17 - 24:20)
pokemon can you help me do it here's how (24:18 - 24:22)
you sneak up on a pokemon and throw a (24:20 - 24:24)
pokeball out yeah (24:22 - 24:26)
that that was what i was thinking too (24:24 - 24:29)
like they were hinting towards a similar (24:26 - 24:33)
uh play style as legends arceus similar (24:29 - 24:35)
not the same but similar (24:33 - 24:37)
um (24:35 - 24:38)
that's kind of what like because they (24:37 - 24:41)
it's weird that they would call that out (24:38 - 24:42)
like (24:41 - 24:44)
okay so what are you hinting at here and (24:42 - 24:46)
i do think they're hinting that that (24:44 - 24:48)
there will be at least options to (24:46 - 24:50)
approach pokemon the same way you did in (24:48 - 24:51)
arceus (24:50 - 24:53)
yeah i still i think about when they (24:51 - 24:55)
like purposely called out when leon they (24:53 - 24:58)
were like leon gets lost really easily (24:55 - 25:02)
and like yeah he gets lost like (24:58 - 25:03)
when you get to the train station for (25:02 - 25:04)
the first time they're like oh i'm (25:03 - 25:06)
surprised he made it here (25:04 - 25:08)
and then they like have like maybe two (25:06 - 25:10)
other instances in the game where (25:08 - 25:11)
they're like i'm surprised you made it (25:10 - 25:13)
here but that was like (25:11 - 25:15)
the extent of it (25:13 - 25:17)
that was like it didn't really go (25:15 - 25:19)
anywhere (25:17 - 25:19)
and i think it's maybe one of those (25:20 - 25:22)
things where maybe laura you guys are (25:21 - 25:24)
right where like she has trouble (25:22 - 25:26)
throwing pokeballs at the beginning to (25:24 - 25:26)
like (25:26 - 25:28)
teach you how to throw pokeballs yeah (25:26 - 25:30)
it's done i mean those professors are (25:28 - 25:32)
busy running schools they're not correct (25:30 - 25:34)
they're gonna have time to be (25:32 - 25:35)
out here (25:34 - 25:37)
teaching you how to throw pokeballs oh (25:35 - 25:39)
there is one really throwaway line in in (25:37 - 25:41)
isle of armor where mustard like makes (25:39 - 25:44)
fun of leon for getting lost yeah which (25:41 - 25:46)
is like really great (25:44 - 25:47)
uh (25:46 - 25:49)
it kind of made the whole like (25:47 - 25:51)
why did they even say he got lost all (25:49 - 25:53)
the time like it kind of like solidified (25:51 - 25:56)
that when mustard like made fun of them (25:53 - 26:00)
uh there's a weird thing on her arm (25:56 - 26:00)
it's like a tron glove but her other arm (26:04 - 26:10)
doesn't have it (26:07 - 26:12)
mean it looks like a sporting it looks (26:10 - 26:14)
like a sports equipment (26:12 - 26:16)
okay yes i i saw somebody on twitter say (26:14 - 26:20)
it was like a sh like for like archery (26:16 - 26:21)
and i was like i don't know what that (26:20 - 26:22)
means (26:21 - 26:23)
oh yeah i mean you have a you keep a (26:22 - 26:25)
guard on your arm because you don't want (26:23 - 26:26)
the (26:25 - 26:27)
the (26:26 - 26:29)
string on the bow snaps back you don't (26:27 - 26:31)
want it to scrape your forearm open (26:29 - 26:32)
okay (26:31 - 26:34)
we don't think this is like a (26:32 - 26:39)
z crystal mega stone uh gigantomax ban (26:34 - 26:40)
like the like (26:39 - 26:42)
we were used to wearing things on our (26:40 - 26:44)
arms now as a pokemon trainer (26:42 - 26:47)
it definitely could be (26:44 - 26:50)
because it's it's not flat right it's (26:47 - 26:53)
got it's got a watch my sense is that (26:50 - 26:54)
this is the new (26:53 - 26:55)
[Music] (26:54 - 26:57)
um (26:55 - 27:00)
rotom decks rotum whatever like this is (26:57 - 27:03)
the new interface that go bring up one (27:00 - 27:04)
of those (27:03 - 27:06)
hover in the air (27:04 - 27:08)
screens type things like that arm thing (27:06 - 27:11)
is the decks the town map the blah blah (27:08 - 27:13)
blah blah blah blah oh so we're not (27:11 - 27:15)
thinking gimmick we're thinking (27:13 - 27:17)
pokedex right i i have a feeling that's (27:15 - 27:20)
i have a feeling that that's the decks (27:17 - 27:21)
kind of based off of the colors a little (27:20 - 27:24)
bit off the fact that it's got it's the (27:21 - 27:25)
circle with the screen on it like a (27:24 - 27:27)
fitbit (27:25 - 27:29)
um (27:27 - 27:29)
it looks like a fitbit to me here (27:32 - 27:35)
obviously (27:33 - 27:37)
but that's what i thought when i saw (27:35 - 27:38)
that i mean it could be something else (27:37 - 27:40)
it could be the gimmick (27:38 - 27:42)
um (27:40 - 27:44)
yeah it almost looks like a robot arm (27:42 - 27:45)
yeah (27:44 - 27:46)
i don't know (27:45 - 27:49)
i mean it could be angers yeah but i i (27:46 - 27:51)
i'm leaning more towards this is how you (27:49 - 27:54)
access town maps et cetera it's like the (27:51 - 27:57)
updated poke (27:54 - 27:57)
before we talk about pokemon because uh (27:58 - 28:02)
we've these are the three new characters (28:00 - 28:04)
they showed they they showed your (28:02 - 28:05)
character they showed character (28:04 - 28:08)
customizations you can be uh black tan (28:05 - 28:11)
white the hair hair not cool hair the (28:08 - 28:13)
hair was so amazing yeah the hair the (28:11 - 28:15)
hair stuff was really happy (28:13 - 28:16)
i will (28:15 - 28:18)
i will never pick it because it's not my (28:16 - 28:21)
hair but i was so happy that that like (28:18 - 28:22)
other (28:21 - 28:25)
types of hair than just (28:22 - 28:29)
flat and spiky anime are in this game (28:25 - 28:32)
it's like finally (28:29 - 28:34)
yeah the hair was really great (28:32 - 28:36)
i i do want to point out because i saw a (28:34 - 28:38)
bunch of people also had similar (28:36 - 28:40)
reactions to me (28:38 - 28:43)
that the professors and the rival (28:40 - 28:45)
are uh like (28:43 - 28:47)
whether you like it or not are a (28:45 - 28:49)
dramatically new look for pokemon (28:47 - 28:51)
characters (28:49 - 28:53)
like (28:51 - 28:56)
they they kind of don't look like they (28:53 - 28:59)
fit in the pokemon universe like and (28:56 - 29:01)
every pokemon game has like styles right (28:59 - 29:03)
like the let's go style the sun and moon (29:01 - 29:05)
style the black drawing like the art of (29:03 - 29:08)
them or the actual the 3d models not the (29:05 - 29:11)
art the art looks like pokemon stuff but (29:08 - 29:13)
in the game they they look very i don't (29:11 - 29:14)
even think they look final fantasy i (29:13 - 29:16)
don't think they match the final fantasy (29:14 - 29:18)
vibe i don't i no i just think that (29:16 - 29:21)
they're like hey this is the next set of (29:18 - 29:23)
graphics that we're doing here yeah i (29:21 - 29:25)
mean i i think they (29:23 - 29:30)
fit stylistically with all the other (29:25 - 29:30)
characters seen i think they look more (29:30 - 29:34)
i will say they look more (29:32 - 29:38)
adult adult than cartoony like the (29:34 - 29:40)
professors across the board have always (29:38 - 29:43)
had sort of either an older (29:40 - 29:47)
fatherly motherly feel or a (29:43 - 29:49)
teeny (29:47 - 29:50)
uh (29:49 - 29:53)
my age early 20s hip sort of feel like (29:50 - 29:56)
kakui like these feel like these people (29:53 - 29:59)
they're solidly in their 30s they're (29:56 - 30:01)
working towards tenure they have their (29:59 - 30:04)
own lives and they need you to go do (30:01 - 30:06)
some stuff for them they just feel like (30:04 - 30:10)
middle-aged adults (30:06 - 30:10)
that also received their glow up (30:10 - 30:15)
recently this year (30:12 - 30:17)
i i think in the 30s but if you look at (30:15 - 30:19)
your your character i think maybe why (30:17 - 30:21)
it's jarring for me and maybe some other (30:19 - 30:23)
people is when you went because they (30:21 - 30:25)
just showed these characters right we (30:23 - 30:26)
we've known what our character has (30:25 - 30:27)
looked like (30:26 - 30:30)
for a couple months now (30:27 - 30:31)
and you look at our character and it (30:30 - 30:34)
does look like the stereotypical like 10 (30:31 - 30:37)
year old on a journey even though i (30:34 - 30:38)
would say recent pokemon games stop (30:37 - 30:40)
saying 10 years old they just say like (30:38 - 30:42)
yeah they said (30:40 - 30:44)
nude trainer they stopped using age at (30:42 - 30:46)
least (30:44 - 30:48)
and i know so like i know they probably (30:46 - 30:50)
look younger because of their outfits (30:48 - 30:52)
they're wearing they're like very school (30:50 - 30:54)
catholic outfits they're wearing (30:52 - 30:56)
but when you see the professors and you (30:54 - 30:59)
see like the rival looks significantly (30:56 - 31:00)
older than you (30:59 - 31:01)
and they say like (31:00 - 31:03)
she absolutely loves pokeball battles (31:01 - 31:07)
she's an experienced trainer (31:03 - 31:07)
but (31:07 - 31:11)
but she's starting her journey with you (31:09 - 31:12)
she's just like she kind of looks like (31:11 - 31:14)
she's five years older than the than (31:12 - 31:16)
your character wait but again maybe (31:14 - 31:19)
she's starting her journey with you (31:16 - 31:21)
uh it says on the website she's an (31:19 - 31:23)
experienced pokemon trainer um a (31:21 - 31:25)
reliable guide for your adventure (31:23 - 31:28)
okay okay maybe she's not starting yeah (31:25 - 31:29)
yeah (31:28 - 31:31)
like she is (31:29 - 31:33)
a fellow like she's graduating out of (31:31 - 31:36)
the schools like she's a senior (31:33 - 31:38)
i mean or like (31:36 - 31:40)
she's in eighth grade or ninth grade and (31:38 - 31:43)
you're in sixth grade and she's using (31:40 - 31:45)
small of (31:43 - 31:48)
what's wrong with smallif dude she has (31:45 - 31:52)
choices that she makes at the beginning (31:48 - 31:52)
i've met fishermen that use six magikarp (31:53 - 31:58)
yeah (31:56 - 31:59)
six (31:58 - 32:01)
and you're going to complain that this (31:59 - 32:03)
young lady is using three at least (32:01 - 32:06)
different pokemon (32:03 - 32:07)
yeah one of them being the greatest (32:06 - 32:11)
pokemon ever revealed in all pokemon (32:07 - 32:14)
history (32:11 - 32:14)
i i am not we can't get to the pokemon (32:15 - 32:20)
yet we gotta take a break uh i i i think (32:17 - 32:22)
the trainer models look fantastic i (32:20 - 32:24)
think looks great i think the professors (32:22 - 32:26)
look great i think all the character (32:24 - 32:28)
customization that they showed for the (32:26 - 32:28)
characters (32:28 - 32:32)
absolutely great i just the the sminer (32:28 - 32:34)
it's not even a complaint it says i know (32:32 - 32:36)
you're gonna say it say it it just looks (32:34 - 32:37)
like your player character looks so much (32:36 - 32:39)
younger than every the three people they (32:37 - 32:41)
showed i mean obviously the professors (32:39 - 32:43)
should be older but like i agree that (32:41 - 32:46)
the player characters look younger (32:43 - 32:49)
i don't know if (32:46 - 32:52)
part of the customization will be (32:49 - 32:55)
more age related so you can make (32:52 - 32:57)
yourself look older (32:55 - 32:59)
because like showing these specific (32:57 - 33:01)
people in these areas so that they have (32:59 - 33:03)
the capability because there's also in (33:01 - 33:05)
the trailer the really young kid out in (33:03 - 33:07)
the field that you meet who whose shirt (33:05 - 33:08)
i want (33:07 - 33:10)
more than anything in the world but i (33:08 - 33:12)
i'm wondering if part of the (33:10 - 33:15)
customization will also be choosing (33:12 - 33:17)
sort of where you fall (33:15 - 33:20)
a little bit in the age range (33:17 - 33:22)
yeah like do we can we just get like a (33:20 - 33:24)
small height slider a small (33:22 - 33:26)
weight slider it doesn't have to be (33:24 - 33:28)
super complex like look it took us this (33:26 - 33:30)
long to get it took us this long to get (33:28 - 33:32)
different skin colors took us even (33:30 - 33:34)
longer to get like different hair styles (33:32 - 33:35)
like (33:34 - 33:37)
as we are advancing in character (33:35 - 33:38)
customization (33:37 - 33:40)
i should say as the pokemon company is (33:38 - 33:42)
advancing because they are very behind (33:40 - 33:44)
on a lot of things uh that those would (33:42 - 33:47)
be like two nice sliders i'm like can i (33:44 - 33:48)
be a little taller can be a little (33:47 - 33:50)
shorter can i be a little wider or (33:48 - 33:53)
thinner or um (33:50 - 33:54)
i don't think you're going to get it i (33:53 - 33:55)
think if that was the case on the (33:54 - 33:57)
multiplayer gameplay screen they would (33:55 - 33:59)
have shown (33:57 - 34:01)
those variations (33:59 - 34:02)
yeah (34:01 - 34:04)
the variations in the clothes (34:02 - 34:06)
you know that they're very select with (34:04 - 34:08)
their first trailer like the sword and (34:06 - 34:09)
shield trailer specifically didn't show (34:08 - 34:12)
pokemon walking around in the wild and (34:09 - 34:13)
we were up i was upset about that and (34:12 - 34:15)
then you know two months later they're (34:13 - 34:16)
like look pokemon walking around in the (34:15 - 34:18)
wild (34:16 - 34:20)
well that's what what not what i was (34:18 - 34:21)
expecting you to complain about i didn't (34:20 - 34:24)
think that was going to be your accept (34:21 - 34:25)
no i it's not really a complaint it's (34:24 - 34:27)
just it's just like the the (34:25 - 34:30)
your character looks very very young but (34:27 - 34:32)
i just thought you were going to express (34:30 - 34:34)
your anti-arborite (34:32 - 34:38)
perceptions and prejudices once again (34:34 - 34:41)
i heard it i heard it on tick-tock or (34:38 - 34:42)
or (34:41 - 34:44)
instagram or facebook (34:42 - 34:48)
stories we're talking about the bush (34:44 - 34:49)
mean (34:48 - 34:51)
i don't think bush counts as a tree but (34:49 - 34:53)
yes (34:51 - 34:54)
we can talk about the graphics but (34:53 - 34:56)
overall we're not going to talk about (34:54 - 34:57)
the graphics i am not having this (34:56 - 35:00)
conversation again (34:57 - 35:03)
i am not having this conversation again (35:00 - 35:05)
take it to your stream take it to your (35:03 - 35:07)
tick tock i am done it is the first time (35:05 - 35:10)
i super disagree like a video games (35:07 - 35:12)
graphics are one of the biggest part (35:10 - 35:13)
that's why people buy games that's why (35:12 - 35:14)
people don't (35:13 - 35:17)
if you fell for the bait (35:14 - 35:22)
debated that's what the kids say debated (35:17 - 35:22)
i think it's a disservice to the (35:22 - 35:25)
thousands of people that listen to the (35:24 - 35:26)
show every week to not talk about (35:25 - 35:29)
graphics of a video game coming out (35:26 - 35:31)
especially when we've talked about how (35:29 - 35:32)
these trainers looked and especially (35:31 - 35:34)
because (35:32 - 35:35)
i think let's go pikachu let's go evie (35:34 - 35:37)
looks absolutely fantastic and i think (35:35 - 35:41)
legends does not look fantastic (35:37 - 35:41)
are we ready for a break yeah we are (35:46 - 35:52)
we will be right back (35:49 - 35:52)

electric sacks on its cheeks palmy has (36:14 - 36:20)
electric uh discharge organs on its four (36:18 - 36:23)
paws it generates electricity by rubbing (36:20 - 36:24)
its cheeks and then it shocks its (36:23 - 36:26)
opponents by touching them with the pads (36:24 - 36:29)
on its four paws the fur that covers its (36:26 - 36:30)
body is good installation against the (36:29 - 36:33)
cold and server and and serves the (36:30 - 36:35)
purpose of storing electricity (36:33 - 36:38)
uh when it feels uneasy this cautious (36:35 - 36:39)
pokemon will be (36:38 - 36:41)
we will begin rubbing its cheeks (36:39 - 36:43)
preparing itself to discharge (36:41 - 36:46)
it's the mouse pokemon electric only (36:43 - 36:49)
type uh with the ability static or (36:46 - 36:51)

type pokemon of that bug type pokemon (37:14 - 37:19)
dislike if attacked by an opponent or (37:16 - 37:21)
startled it will charge forward in a (37:19 - 37:22)
panic (37:21 - 37:23)
it may appear fat at first but in (37:22 - 37:26)
reality this pokemon's body is mostly (37:23 - 37:28)
muscle built by consistent walking (37:26 - 37:30)
around in search of food (37:28 - 37:33)
this is the hog pokemon (37:30 - 37:35)

bitter taste it's not suitable for (37:50 - 37:54)
consumption when startled or attacked (37:52 - 37:57)
small live will shoot oil out slowing (37:54 - 37:59)
its opponents down it will then seize (37:57 - 38:01)
that moment to run away that's kind of (37:59 - 38:02)

we we can't be together you've got it (39:56 - 40:01)
you've got to see it in motion you've (39:59 - 40:03)
got yeah it's true walking around when (40:01 - 40:07)
it comes out when it comes out from (40:03 - 40:07)
it's like i have found a truffle (40:07 - 40:13)
my job here is complete yes (40:10 - 40:15)
these are some good names though oh (40:13 - 40:17)

day and i can tell you you're wrong the (40:28 - 40:34)

olives are delicious and i hate (40:34 - 40:37)
wonderful (40:36 - 40:39)
see is it because you hate olives or (40:37 - 40:42)
because people compared it to badou (40:39 - 40:46)
uh it mainly because i i did not like i (40:42 - 40:50)
just i'm not a huge fan of the design (40:46 - 40:53)
more than anything i just feel like it's (40:50 - 40:54)
i don't know (40:53 - 40:57)
it just doesn't do anything for me it's (40:54 - 40:59)
the same sort of negative reaction i had (40:57 - 41:02)
against sabal at first like (40:59 - 41:03)
it's just not like you don't like (41:02 - 41:08)

i don't want any of these feelings no i (41:11 - 41:16)
just it doesn't really i don't know the (41:13 - 41:18)
the i think for me the design was just (41:16 - 41:20)
too (41:18 - 41:23)
simple like no it's a it's a ball with (41:20 - 41:26)
an olive on its head (41:23 - 41:29)
that's a small olive pokemon (41:26 - 41:30)
i think (41:29 - 41:30)
uh (41:30 - 41:32)
game freak (41:30 - 41:35)
has realized that (41:32 - 41:37)
pokemon like people like when they can (41:35 - 41:39)
put pokemon together (41:37 - 41:42)
and what i mean by that is like snom and (41:39 - 41:45)
pincurchen and uh (41:42 - 41:48)
pikamiuku (41:45 - 41:50)
it felt like part of smallov's design (41:48 - 41:52)
was like we can put this with like badou (41:50 - 41:53)
and petal (41:52 - 41:55)
and people will be like oh look at this (41:53 - 41:58)
group and uh (41:55 - 41:59)
who is it because if it's not i don't (41:58 - 42:01)
know i feel like they still baited all (41:59 - 42:04)
the artists to do that anyways (42:01 - 42:04)
uh (42:06 - 42:10)
tag nabbit before sunflora sun curtain (42:07 - 42:12)
sun currents yeah (42:10 - 42:14)
sun current fits in that (42:12 - 42:16)
um and they've been doing that for years (42:14 - 42:19)
with like the pikachu clones yeah um (42:16 - 42:22)
which i guess we should talk about palmy (42:19 - 42:24)
palmy is a big it probably is this (42:22 - 42:27)
generations pikachu club yeah (42:24 - 42:30)
yes i guess it is the mouse pokemon it (42:27 - 42:31)
is electric (42:30 - 42:35)
it has like very two common abilities (42:31 - 42:37)
like so i'm looking at palmy and i'm (42:35 - 42:39)
like what is this what's special here (42:37 - 42:43)
what is the gimmick it's evolution (42:39 - 42:44)
yeah (42:43 - 42:48)
yeah it could be it could evolve (42:44 - 42:50)
because right now the issue does right (42:48 - 42:52)
because okay so let's back up (42:50 - 42:54)
if you look at um (42:52 - 42:56)
more peco (42:54 - 42:58)
more petco had not only had a form (42:56 - 43:00)
change (42:58 - 43:01)
uh (43:00 - 43:03)
but it had like an exclusive ability (43:01 - 43:05)
well i guess the ability is the form (43:03 - 43:07)
change the hangry mode (43:05 - 43:08)
uh (43:07 - 43:10)
and then it could have you know a move (43:08 - 43:13)
depend like it's move pool not move pool (43:10 - 43:15)
but one of its moves changed in and out (43:13 - 43:17)
of hangry mode very good gimmick (43:15 - 43:20)
was used by the rival (43:17 - 43:22)
marnie (43:20 - 43:24)
and then before that (43:22 - 43:25)
in gen 7 (43:24 - 43:28)
we had dedenae (43:25 - 43:30)
and de dene (43:28 - 43:33)
got the fairy we had two though right no (43:30 - 43:35)
sorry diddy's gen six my apologies we (43:33 - 43:37)
had togo tomorrow (43:35 - 43:39)
yes (43:37 - 43:42)
and togo tomorrow at least had like that (43:39 - 43:45)
it wasn't like i think it was exclusive (43:42 - 43:46)
to chestnut but then they gave it to (43:45 - 43:49)
togo tomorrow the spiky shield move (43:46 - 43:54)
um if i'm remembering correctly (43:49 - 43:54)
but togo tomorrow still (43:56 - 44:00)
not like it still felt like there was a (44:00 - 44:04)
gimmick to it (44:03 - 44:07)
for being like steel electric (44:04 - 44:10)
it had uh sturdy and iron barbs and (44:07 - 44:12)
lightning rod (44:10 - 44:13)
um (44:12 - 44:14)
[Music] (44:13 - 44:17)
oh it did have a signature move it was (44:14 - 44:18)
zing zap (44:17 - 44:20)
so i suppose we don't know what palmy's (44:18 - 44:23)
signature move is um did (44:20 - 44:25)
kind of get like a free pass because (44:23 - 44:26)
like it was they needed to like (44:25 - 44:28)
introduce fairy types gen 6 is when (44:26 - 44:30)
fairy types were introduced it had cheek (44:28 - 44:32)
pouch it had pickup (44:30 - 44:34)
um (44:32 - 44:36)
i want to say it had its own exclusive (44:34 - 44:38)
move (44:36 - 44:40)
but i can't think of what it is (44:38 - 44:42)
obviously mimikyu is there where like (44:40 - 44:44)
mimiki's not really a pikachu clone it's (44:42 - 44:48)
just a pokemon that wants to be pikachu (44:44 - 44:48)
so i'm looking at palmy and i'm like (44:48 - 44:54)
hey this is the pikachu clone but what (44:51 - 44:55)
makes it special (44:54 - 44:57)
does it have to does everybody have to (44:55 - 44:58)
be special (44:57 - 45:00)
yeah that's what my parents told me in (44:58 - 45:02)
the 90s when i was like that's why i (45:00 - 45:05)
lined it up the way you did um (45:02 - 45:07)
i mean it's it's going to be the (45:05 - 45:09)
evolution paul you (45:07 - 45:12)
that's what's going on yeah paw you (45:09 - 45:13)
it's going to have all people are like (45:12 - 45:15)
it's going to evolve into gorochu (45:13 - 45:16)
finally (45:15 - 45:17)
[Laughter] (45:16 - 45:20)
peekaboo (45:17 - 45:20)
yeah i don't see i don't think uh didn't (45:21 - 45:27)
i has a signature move (45:23 - 45:27)
not that i'm sitting here (45:27 - 45:30)
it's going to be fighting electric (45:31 - 45:35)
paw you (45:33 - 45:37)
i and i don't know if it's just because (45:35 - 45:41)
smalliv and lechonk um (45:37 - 45:44)
just overpowered palmy or it's just that (45:41 - 45:46)
palmy came (45:44 - 45:48)
tommy came across very generic (45:46 - 45:49)
yeah i think pommy comes across very (45:48 - 45:52)
generic like (45:49 - 45:55)
even the pictures that they use on from (45:52 - 45:59)
the screenshots i'm like okay (45:55 - 45:59)
does that it's just (45:59 - 46:03)
okay (46:00 - 46:03)
yeah no i agree it's just there's (46:03 - 46:06)
there's (46:05 - 46:08)
nothing yet to be like oh i've got to (46:06 - 46:10)
have this pokemon like (46:08 - 46:14)
lechonka is like the design of the chunk (46:10 - 46:16)
is good but the name (46:14 - 46:18)
is amazing (46:16 - 46:20)
and small of the name is pretty good and (46:18 - 46:22)
the design is is for a lot of people (46:20 - 46:24)
really good it's not for me but like (46:22 - 46:29)
those two things really have strong (46:24 - 46:29)
you know something very strong about (46:30 - 46:34)
them and i think everything about pommy (46:31 - 46:36)
is okay (46:34 - 46:38)
you know it's the expected pikachu clone (46:36 - 46:41)
the name is is pause (46:38 - 46:43)
pause on me like it it doesn't know how (46:41 - 46:45)
to stay down is it like a out of control (46:43 - 46:48)
because it's got the electric (46:45 - 46:53)
sex in its paws right it's four paws so (46:48 - 46:53)
i do think it's a good design though (46:54 - 46:58)
and i think maybe if it wasn't shown uh (46:56 - 47:02)
with lechonk and and small live it might (46:58 - 47:04)
have gotten like more or less overshadow (47:02 - 47:06)
overshadowed yeah i think the other two (47:04 - 47:08)
just overshadowed it (47:06 - 47:12)
that's right (47:08 - 47:12)
yeah i think it's cute the more i look (47:12 - 47:15)
at it the more i do like it like i like (47:14 - 47:17)
the little green inside its ears i like (47:15 - 47:20)
how like chubby he is um (47:17 - 47:22)
the thing is i only like the artist (47:20 - 47:24)
drawing of it i don't like it in either (47:22 - 47:26)
of the two screenshots (47:24 - 47:28)
yeah i'm like those screenshots aren't (47:26 - 47:30)
great yeah i like i like the artist (47:28 - 47:32)
rendition of it but when i look in the (47:30 - 47:34)
screenshots i'm like oh (47:32 - 47:36)
that doesn't look as thick in the game (47:34 - 47:38)
as he does in the artistry right and (47:36 - 47:40)
like lechonk looks (47:38 - 47:42)
almost the same as the artist the same (47:40 - 47:44)
with smalliff like (47:42 - 47:46)
i i think one of the weird feelings i (47:44 - 47:48)
have about pommy is when i look at it in (47:46 - 47:50)
game and the ones that they chose i'm (47:48 - 47:52)
like it just doesn't look very good to (47:50 - 47:54)
me (47:52 - 47:54)
i feel like the hair tough just is (47:54 - 47:58)
really weirdly divided (47:56 - 48:01)
in the screenshots uh it doesn't look as (47:58 - 48:03)
fluffy or as (48:01 - 48:05)
and it just it doesn't look the same in (48:03 - 48:07)
the screenshots and i think that's where (48:05 - 48:08)
my issue (48:07 - 48:11)
comes from with paumy (48:08 - 48:12)
i think he has there has to be a (48:11 - 48:14)
signature move or like an evolution or (48:12 - 48:16)
something here because the the ability (48:14 - 48:18)
and the the category and the typing (48:16 - 48:20)
isn't (48:18 - 48:22)
standing out at all yeah (48:20 - 48:26)
i mean i feel like (48:22 - 48:26)
all of these are going to get evolutions (48:26 - 48:30)
and that's like this is her starting (48:28 - 48:32)
team so they're i feel like they're also (48:30 - 48:34)
sort of hinting that they're all going (48:32 - 48:36)
to get evolutions right like i don't (48:34 - 48:38)
think smaller is going to stay a small (48:36 - 48:40)
olive the entire time well especially (48:38 - 48:41)
because (48:40 - 48:44)
green olives are unripe olives it's the (48:41 - 48:46)
black olives that are the ripe olives so (48:44 - 48:48)
it has to become a black olive oh you (48:46 - 48:50)
don't think like it's shiny it's just (48:48 - 48:51)
going to be black (48:50 - 48:54)
to signify that but that's not what that (48:51 - 48:57)
means (48:54 - 48:57)
i don't know anything about olives i (48:57 - 49:00)
know there's black i just told you (48:58 - 49:02)
everything you need to know a green (49:00 - 49:04)
olive is not ripe olive a black olive is (49:02 - 49:06)
a ripe olive but people eat green olives (49:04 - 49:09)
right okay yeah yeah okay (49:06 - 49:11)
so the way the green turns into the (49:09 - 49:13)
black yes yes they're not too different (49:11 - 49:15)
it's not like green grapes and purple (49:13 - 49:18)
grapes what olive it's like red grapes (49:15 - 49:21)
it's like a grape to a raisin (49:18 - 49:24)
they're all okay the same thing right (49:21 - 49:26)
it's just the raisins the old grape (49:24 - 49:29)
the the grape is the young grape green (49:26 - 49:32)
olive is the young olive the black ones (49:29 - 49:33)
the oldest (49:32 - 49:34)
i thought they were totally i thought it (49:33 - 49:36)
was like grapes like oh there's two (49:34 - 49:37)
different types of grapes what will be (49:36 - 49:42)
interesting is if its evolution is like (49:37 - 49:44)
kalamata (49:42 - 49:46)
because that is technically a very greek (49:44 - 49:48)
kind of (49:46 - 49:51)
only comes from one location in greece (49:48 - 49:52)
so (49:51 - 49:55)
i mean i would guess that the shiny form (49:52 - 49:58)
would be more of because sometimes you (49:55 - 49:59)
get (49:58 - 50:00)
more (49:59 - 50:02)
reddish (50:00 - 50:04)
green olives (50:02 - 50:05)
so i i they could do that for the shiny (50:04 - 50:08)
but yeah like (50:05 - 50:10)
the black olive is the is the older (50:08 - 50:12)
older (50:10 - 50:13)
got it (50:12 - 50:15)
uh then i just don't want le chunk to (50:13 - 50:17)
become a fighting type (50:15 - 50:18)
nah (50:17 - 50:19)
fighting normal (50:18 - 50:22)
it's gonna be grass (50:19 - 50:22)
no really do we have fighting normal (50:23 - 50:28)
um (50:25 - 50:28)
um (50:33 - 50:37)
the new legendary pokemon appearing in (50:34 - 50:38)
the titles uh (50:37 - 50:41)
karadon and miraidon are i hope i said (50:38 - 50:43)
those okay but we'll figure it out later (50:41 - 50:45)
are on each cover of the retail version (50:43 - 50:47)
of the game the title logos are (50:45 - 50:49)
embellished with a foil stamp like (50:47 - 50:51)
design that use the legendaries as (50:49 - 50:53)
motifs the package of these games uh (50:51 - 50:55)
have a similar look to cover of old (50:53 - 50:57)
books invoking a new (50:55 - 51:00)
uh invoke invoking the feeling that a (50:57 - 51:02)
new story lies ahead (51:00 - 51:04)
so this is we are jumping around a (51:02 - 51:06)
little bit here but the um because we (51:04 - 51:08)
haven't talked about like the open (51:06 - 51:10)
worldness and the multiplayer stuff so (51:08 - 51:13)
we're still in pokemon mode apologize (51:10 - 51:15)
uh we'll get to it (51:13 - 51:16)
but this was shown at the end of the (51:15 - 51:19)
trailer so these are our five pokemon (51:16 - 51:22)
le chonck pawnee smalliv now the two (51:19 - 51:25)
legendaries me ridon and ko ridon (51:22 - 51:27)
and (51:25 - 51:29)
i will say these are some of the best (51:27 - 51:31)
legends in oh (51:29 - 51:34)
yeah i love zach love zomba magenta love (51:31 - 51:35)
amorous love (51:34 - 51:37)
[Music] (51:35 - 51:39)
you name them love like those are great (51:37 - 51:42)
but these are really great i really i (51:39 - 51:45)
honestly was not going to buy both games (51:42 - 51:47)
and when they showed (51:45 - 51:49)
both legendaries i'm like (51:47 - 51:52)
i want both of them in equal parts i (51:49 - 51:53)
love (51:52 - 51:56)
both of them i think they look fantastic (51:53 - 51:58)
and i'm like i i'm just going to get two (51:56 - 51:59)
because i want i want to make sure that (51:58 - 52:02)
i i have both because i really like (51:59 - 52:05)
their design (52:02 - 52:05)
will's gonna be like i hate both of them (52:06 - 52:10)
i i mean (52:08 - 52:11)
[Applause] (52:10 - 52:13)
the thing is (52:11 - 52:15)
i don't care about (52:13 - 52:18)
kuraidon i think koridon looks like (52:15 - 52:20)
could have been in any game who cares (52:18 - 52:21)
whatever (52:20 - 52:24)
and i was really having high hopes for (52:21 - 52:26)
miraidon but why couldn't it have just (52:24 - 52:27)
been a snake (52:26 - 52:29)
why couldn't it have been similar to (52:27 - 52:32)
rayquaza why did it have to have weird (52:29 - 52:35)
arms and legs that because it turns into (52:32 - 52:38)
a motorcycle (52:35 - 52:41)
transformers they are transformers sure (52:38 - 52:42)
but it's just like (52:41 - 52:45)
it it it could they have animated it a (52:42 - 52:46)
little better (52:45 - 52:47)
like if it's floating make it look like (52:46 - 52:49)
it's floating not like it's kind of (52:47 - 52:51)
balancing on its tail there that was a (52:49 - 52:53)
big disappointment for me (52:51 - 52:55)
i thought it was floating because of its (52:53 - 52:57)
jet engine legs (52:55 - 53:00)
but yeah yeah but if you look at the way (52:57 - 53:01)
it you you see the jet engine legs and (53:00 - 53:03)
then you see it's like it's on a (53:01 - 53:05)
pedestal like standing on its tail i was (53:03 - 53:06)
like just have the tail up in the air (53:05 - 53:08)
have it float you're gonna have it float (53:06 - 53:10)
have it float (53:08 - 53:12)
i wanted it to be like i wanted it to be (53:10 - 53:15)
a pencil (53:12 - 53:15)
yeah i wanted to be like quetzalcoatl (53:16 - 53:21)
and oh yeah i kind of fallen short (53:18 - 53:23)
to me it's it's crazy that they were (53:21 - 53:25)
like here are the legends (53:23 - 53:27)
hear their names (53:25 - 53:29)
hear the cover of the games (53:27 - 53:31)
no region we ain't going to tell you (53:29 - 53:34)
that no it's the risotto region (53:31 - 53:36)
they haven't named it they have it's the (53:34 - 53:39)
paella region because it's got olives in (53:36 - 53:41)
it yeah paella (53:39 - 53:44)
so i i think i think both of these (53:41 - 53:46)
pokemon are fantastic i think it's it's (53:44 - 53:49)
very obvious that karadon has a tire (53:46 - 53:50)
coming out of his chest (53:49 - 53:53)
uh i mean a weakness (53:50 - 53:57)
a wheel not a time my ride on has uh (53:53 - 53:59)
you could say it's like kind of like a (53:57 - 54:01)
wheel slash tire you can kind of see the (53:59 - 54:03)
treads in the like (54:01 - 54:05)
galaxy space thing that's happening here (54:03 - 54:07)
um (54:05 - 54:09)
but yeah but yeah uh i think (54:07 - 54:12)
when you when you say that these pokemon (54:09 - 54:14)
are probably going to transform in some (54:12 - 54:15)
way (54:14 - 54:18)
into a vehicle of some sort i most (54:15 - 54:21)
people are saying that (54:18 - 54:22)
i don't know if it's a motorcycle a (54:21 - 54:26)
scooter a car a plane a jet engine (54:22 - 54:26)
so (54:26 - 54:28)
there's there's a couple things here (54:26 - 54:34)
like in rpgs weird vehicles are are not (54:28 - 54:35)
uh unheard of (54:34 - 54:37)
final fantasy is very famous for this (54:35 - 54:39)
especially 15 where your car turns into (54:37 - 54:42)
a jet plane at one point you don't want (54:39 - 54:43)
to know what you can ride out in final (54:42 - 54:45)
fantasy 14 right now because it's (54:43 - 54:47)
basically everything (54:45 - 54:48)
so (54:47 - 54:50)
other games (54:48 - 54:52)
also i can't help but think of yu-gi-oh (54:50 - 54:55)
at one point yu-gi-oh we have not gone a (54:52 - 54:57)
single week in the last like two months (54:55 - 54:59)
without talking about you yeah you keep (54:57 - 55:02)
bringing it up in yugioh 4d they (54:59 - 55:05)
literally play yu-gi-oh on motorcycles (55:02 - 55:06)
true (55:05 - 55:09)
the playstation (55:06 - 55:11)
presentation yesterday showed a game (55:09 - 55:14)
with anime people riding on motorcycles (55:11 - 55:17)
motorcycles and anime and video games (55:14 - 55:19)
are they have gotten together since (55:17 - 55:21)
akira i was just going to say blame it (55:19 - 55:23)
on akira let me have the hero okay he (55:21 - 55:25)
did it and we we also know that game (55:23 - 55:29)
freak is always behind the times like (55:25 - 55:30)
with z crystals it was like final (55:29 - 55:33)
fantasy was doing this for 20 some years (55:30 - 55:36)
he's just finally caught up (55:33 - 55:38)
this is the new bike they're the new (55:36 - 55:40)
bikes you catch them early on and this (55:38 - 55:42)
is how you get to places (55:40 - 55:43)
it's the second thing you do is you go (55:42 - 55:45)
catch them and then you can access the (55:43 - 55:47)
sea (55:45 - 55:49)
so yeah i i think there there's no way (55:47 - 55:51)
that these pokemon don't transform into (55:49 - 55:53)
some sort of vehicle (55:51 - 55:54)
um (55:53 - 55:56)
the transforming thing we've had that (55:54 - 56:00)
happen with lunala and solgaleo and uh (55:56 - 56:03)
the restaurant kiram they merge slash (56:00 - 56:05)
transform like that's that stuff all (56:03 - 56:06)
of the (56:05 - 56:08)
all of the weather (56:06 - 56:11)
things that's where they are (56:08 - 56:13)
the the kami (56:11 - 56:15)
yeah um (56:13 - 56:17)
i think the other thing and i don't want (56:15 - 56:18)
to talk too much about the the pokemon (56:17 - 56:20)
centers until after the break because (56:18 - 56:22)
that's part of the open world but if we (56:20 - 56:23)
look at the pokemon centers they (56:22 - 56:24)
literally look like gas stations they (56:23 - 56:27)
have like little parking lots (56:24 - 56:29)
um and they're out in the open world and (56:27 - 56:31)
they look like (56:29 - 56:32)
they look like drive up (56:31 - 56:35)
diners to me (56:32 - 56:36)
i think they look like gas stations but (56:35 - 56:39)
i can see the drive up diner um vibe as (56:36 - 56:40)
well (56:39 - 56:42)
and then the last thing is when you look (56:40 - 56:43)
at the gym leader stuff you see like (56:42 - 56:46)
what looks to be two racing flags (56:43 - 56:48)
uh i mean the reason why i said they (56:46 - 56:49)
have they look like a dinosaur because (56:48 - 56:51)
there's literally a table and seat out (56:49 - 56:53)
front (56:51 - 56:55)
gas stations have picnic tables and (56:53 - 56:57)
seats as well (56:55 - 56:59)
at least the ones in milwaukee did (56:57 - 57:01)
nah (56:59 - 57:03)
no are you talking about like a bar to (57:01 - 57:04)
sit at (57:03 - 57:05)
are you talking about like a picnic (57:04 - 57:09)
table no like this has an actual couchy (57:05 - 57:12)
seat and table in the picture of the (57:09 - 57:14)
of the pokemon center (57:12 - 57:17)
like an actual i didn't notice that (57:14 - 57:19)
yeah they look like it's like a table (57:17 - 57:21)
and an actual couch (57:19 - 57:23)
yeah yeah yeah but the tables look like (57:21 - 57:24)
the tables you get at like a wedding (57:23 - 57:26)
where it looks like that well they look (57:24 - 57:27)
like diner tables they look like tables (57:26 - 57:30)
at 50s diners drive up diners but if you (57:27 - 57:31)
look it does look like a parking lot (57:30 - 57:33)
though like you can kind of see like (57:31 - 57:36)
lines almost in the like parking lot (57:33 - 57:39)
yeah like drive up diners of the 50s (57:36 - 57:41)
um okay so (57:39 - 57:42)
so (57:41 - 57:44)
obviously the theories (57:42 - 57:46)
seem like these two legendaries are (57:44 - 57:48)
going to transform into vehicles (57:46 - 57:52)
that brings me back to le chunk (57:48 - 57:52)
because hogs (57:52 - 57:59)
are a form of motorcycle (57:55 - 57:59)
oh milwaukee (57:59 - 58:04)
so if he if he evolves until like (58:01 - 58:06)
la hogg (58:04 - 58:08)
and he is a rideable pokemon and i want (58:06 - 58:10)
to talk about ridable pokemon because (58:08 - 58:11)
we've had ridable pokemon before right (58:10 - 58:14)
and sudden moon we we rode on tauros (58:11 - 58:16)
or lapras or sharpedo and let's go (58:14 - 58:18)
pikachu let's go evie we rode on (58:16 - 58:21)
arcanine and persian and snorlax and (58:18 - 58:24)
onyx in legends we wrote on bravery (58:21 - 58:27)
weird deer basket legion so none of this (58:24 - 58:30)
is unheard of but uh but in past games (58:27 - 58:32)
legendaries are near the end of the game (58:30 - 58:35)
so there needs to be other forms of (58:32 - 58:38)
transportation for non-americans (58:35 - 58:42)
the reason hogs refer to a very specific (58:38 - 58:45)
motorcycle which are harley davidsons (58:42 - 58:47)
the reason why they're called hogs is (58:45 - 58:49)
because the groups that owned them were (58:47 - 58:53)
the harley owners groups hog it was a (58:49 - 58:57)
big club it still is for harley davidson (58:53 - 59:03)
enthusiasts so hogs aren't a motorcycle (58:57 - 59:03)
like bran they it is specifically harley (59:03 - 59:10)
davidson motorcycles and the people who (59:07 - 59:12)
ride them you can look up (59:10 - 59:14)
it's harley davis has a very specific (59:12 - 59:16)
style (59:14 - 59:19)
that is usually what's referred to as a (59:16 - 59:20)
hog (59:19 - 59:23)
they have been trying to get a younger (59:20 - 59:25)
audience recently but yeah harley (59:23 - 59:27)
is a very specific (59:25 - 59:30)
it's a very he's got a very specific (59:27 - 59:33)
american (59:30 - 59:34)
image (59:33 - 59:35)
uh (59:34 - 59:38)
everybody of a certain age well would (59:35 - 59:39)
you say (59:38 - 59:41)
hog or a hog rider they all (59:39 - 59:43)
have one (59:41 - 59:44)
one (59:43 - 59:46)
one image in their head pretty much yeah (59:44 - 59:48)
they're they're i think they started off (59:46 - 59:51)
as like uh like a an electric or a bike (59:48 - 59:53)
company right like a bicycle (59:51 - 59:56)
and then they moved harley davidson yeah (59:53 - 59:58)
because then they recently announced an (59:56 - 60:00)
electric bike and then people were like (59:58 - 60:01)
oh this looks like the original bike you (60:00 - 60:04)
kind of started off with (60:01 - 60:06)
i don't know (60:04 - 60:06)
milwaukee yeah yeah they started they (60:06 - 60:10)
started in milwaukee there's like (60:08 - 60:12)
actually if you don't care about like (60:10 - 60:14)
motorcycles or whatever at all the (60:12 - 60:16)
harley-davidson museum is actually still (60:14 - 60:18)
like a really cool place to like visit (60:16 - 60:20)
and go and it's more than just like (60:18 - 60:21)
their motorcycles it's like a lot of (60:20 - 60:23)
milwaukee history it's like a actually a (60:21 - 60:25)
fantastic museum i don't remember how (60:23 - 60:27)
much it cost but it's down there in the (60:25 - 60:30)
i i guess that is uh worth saying if (60:27 - 60:31)
you're going to milwaukee for regionals (60:30 - 60:33)
i will also be in milwaukee to play (60:31 - 60:35)
sword and shield which is in like two (60:33 - 60:38)
weeks so if you need things to do uh and (60:35 - 60:40)
you care about motorcycles definitely go (60:38 - 60:41)
to the harley-davidson museum if you (60:40 - 60:43)
just need something to do and you just (60:41 - 60:44)
want to know milwaukee history i still (60:43 - 60:46)
think the harley davidson i mean (60:44 - 60:48)
museum is still pretty good according to (60:46 - 60:50)
this (60:48 - 60:51)
uh (60:50 - 60:53)
they have always been a motorcycle (60:51 - 60:57)
company they started in 1903 their first (60:53 - 61:00)
prototype was basically a big engine on (60:57 - 61:02)
a bike okay (61:00 - 61:06)
like it was 1903 so that's that's (61:02 - 61:08)
like they've been around for a very long (61:06 - 61:10)
time but they've always produced (61:08 - 61:12)
motorcycles so i think what people are (61:10 - 61:14)
referring to now is they've gone back to (61:12 - 61:16)
that it looks like the very first (61:14 - 61:18)
prototype they made with this new (61:16 - 61:20)
electric bike (61:18 - 61:22)
yeah i i think i i think there's no (61:20 - 61:23)
doubt electric bikes are going to get (61:22 - 61:26)
more and more popular um especially like (61:23 - 61:28)
right now i think the thing that's (61:26 - 61:29)
holding people back is just price on (61:28 - 61:32)
electric bikes yes um but as those (61:29 - 61:34)
prices come down and everything that's (61:32 - 61:36)
what harley is at least trying to do is (61:34 - 61:37)
trying to like (61:36 - 61:39)
make a staple in the electric bike (61:37 - 61:40)
market because they're betting that is (61:39 - 61:44)
their only way to get younger people (61:40 - 61:45)
which is like a really good like (61:44 - 61:47)
business-wise it makes sense like that (61:45 - 61:49)
would be a good decision to make of like (61:47 - 61:50)
yeah you're right you do need a younger (61:49 - 61:52)
audience and this is the way to get them (61:50 - 61:54)
so i think their electric bike looks (61:52 - 61:57)
kind of cool but anyways yeah i just (61:54 - 61:58)
pulled up the picture and it does look (61:57 - 62:00)
like their first prototype (61:58 - 62:01)
like it's a modernized version of their (62:00 - 62:04)
first prototype but yes (62:01 - 62:06)
um i could see (62:04 - 62:09)
i could see le chunk turning into (62:06 - 62:11)
something ridable it doesn't happen (62:09 - 62:13)
like (62:11 - 62:15)
there is a very specific hog writer (62:13 - 62:17)
image (62:15 - 62:19)
that is associated with harley davidson (62:17 - 62:22)
all the years of playing clash royale we (62:19 - 62:24)
are fighting along we're finally back to (62:22 - 62:25)
hog rider (62:24 - 62:27)
um (62:25 - 62:29)
i could i mean i could see it becoming a (62:27 - 62:32)
more humanoid on two legs (62:29 - 62:34)
hog rider-esque i don't know that it (62:32 - 62:36)
will be writable (62:34 - 62:39)
i think le chunk is the early game (62:36 - 62:42)
we're riding this around (62:39 - 62:43)
i think like (62:42 - 62:44)
it's more likely that we'll have (62:43 - 62:46)
rideable tourists than (62:44 - 62:48)
an early (62:46 - 62:51)
writable version of the chunk (62:48 - 62:51)
okay we have to talk about what early (62:52 - 62:58)
means in the context of this game (62:54 - 63:00)
right um (62:58 - 63:02)
yeah i don't i don't think we have any (63:00 - 63:05)
anything else about small live (63:02 - 63:07)
um it definitely like (63:05 - 63:08)
caters to (63:07 - 63:11)
people who like these smaller cry baby (63:08 - 63:12)
very scary cat pokemon i think (63:11 - 63:14)
smalling's great i think the name is (63:12 - 63:16)
great le chunk name is great pokemon is (63:14 - 63:17)
great (63:16 - 63:18)
although le chunk very much does seem (63:17 - 63:20)
like the wulu where you know everyone's (63:18 - 63:22)
obsessed with it but then very quickly (63:20 - 63:24)
realized there there's 60 other pokemon (63:22 - 63:27)
that are more exciting (63:24 - 63:29)
like not in like (63:27 - 63:31)
theme but like normal pokemon don't (63:29 - 63:33)
really last too long on a team you don't (63:31 - 63:35)
need anything for super effective this (63:33 - 63:37)
could change (63:35 - 63:39)
look chalk could be the one that changes (63:37 - 63:41)
it all (63:39 - 63:42)
palmy like (63:41 - 63:43)
feels like they're purposely hiding (63:42 - 63:45)
something there (63:43 - 63:46)
uh (63:45 - 63:47)
last thing i want to talk about before (63:46 - 63:50)
we take a break legendary typing i did (63:47 - 63:52)
say this on twitter i'm not going to (63:50 - 63:54)
place any bets on what these poke we we (63:52 - 63:56)
on this show (63:54 - 63:57)
were all wrong (63:56 - 63:59)
we all thought there was no way that (63:57 - 64:01)
solgaleo could not be fire type its name (63:59 - 64:03)
is soul (64:01 - 64:05)
it's supposed to represent the sun it (64:03 - 64:08)
ended up being psychic steel (64:05 - 64:10)
[Music] (64:08 - 64:12)
not anywhere near that (64:10 - 64:13)
um (64:12 - 64:15)
i mean i'll i'll go out fighting and (64:13 - 64:16)
electric that's what i'm going to go (64:15 - 64:20)
with i'll make a decision (64:16 - 64:20)
fighting maradona's electric at least (64:20 - 64:27)
part done i made my choice (64:22 - 64:27)
i don't get fighting vibes from (64:27 - 64:32)
the first one (64:30 - 64:33)
i (64:32 - 64:35)
i get more like okay if i'm gonna be (64:33 - 64:37)
wrong i might be wrong both you can get (64:35 - 64:40)
your vibes however you want them i get (64:37 - 64:44)
more like ground vibes from him (64:40 - 64:45)
with all the feathers (64:44 - 64:48)
yeah (64:45 - 64:48)
how do feathers make a ground (64:48 - 64:52)
i don't think it's the feathers i think (64:51 - 64:55)
it's like the the like the body (64:52 - 64:58)
structure and then like the tire (64:55 - 65:00)
being very like grounded he like he (64:58 - 65:03)
looks very grounded to me (65:00 - 65:04)
it's more like a dinosaur and you know (65:03 - 65:06)
how like we actually have discovered (65:04 - 65:09)
that dinosaurs had feathers it's going (65:06 - 65:10)
to be along those lines (65:09 - 65:13)
it's rock type rock fighting (65:10 - 65:14)
um (65:13 - 65:16)
well i guess the default is like they (65:14 - 65:18)
both look like dragons right (65:16 - 65:21)
so if we if we look at other dragons (65:18 - 65:25)
reshiram and zekrom fire dragon electric (65:21 - 65:27)
dragon there's no way they're gonna (65:25 - 65:29)
recycle that again oh really (65:27 - 65:34)
no there's no way no it cannot happen (65:29 - 65:34)
another psychic mythical pokemon (65:35 - 65:39)
firefighting things that would like to (65:39 - 65:42)
have a conversation about recycling with (65:40 - 65:47)
you um it's possible that me ride on is (65:42 - 65:49)
uh like steel electric it doesn't (65:47 - 65:52)
necessarily have to be dragon just like (65:49 - 65:55)
solgaleo didn't have to be fire even (65:52 - 65:57)
though its name comes from the sun (65:55 - 66:00)
i'm trying to remember who told me (65:57 - 66:05)
that korai is like ancient or past and (66:00 - 66:07)
yeah yeah yes i remember who said that (66:05 - 66:09)
to me it's probably polka jungle (66:07 - 66:12)
translate.google.com will tell you that (66:09 - 66:15)
i mean the the thing is (66:12 - 66:15)
do we have a (66:16 - 66:20)
steel (66:18 - 66:21)
um (66:20 - 66:24)

it's real hard to test i i've got (69:22 - 69:27)
nothing i got no no nothing to throw in (69:24 - 69:29)
here i think there was like a four-chan (69:27 - 69:30)

it was like (69:30 - 69:34)
fighting dragon (69:32 - 69:37)
electric dragon but i i don't know (69:34 - 69:39)

read that again pokemon scarlet and (70:24 - 70:28)
pokemon violet are the first open world (70:26 - 70:31)
rpgs in the pokemon series now (70:28 - 70:32)
somebody's going to quickly run a (70:31 - 70:33)
youtube comments hey if you're watching (70:32 - 70:35)
on youtube like comment subscribe if you (70:33 - 70:36)
want to comment this you're more than (70:35 - 70:38)
welcome to you're going to say what (70:36 - 70:40)
about legends arceus (70:38 - 70:42)
the pokemon company never said that was (70:40 - 70:44)
an open world game no and it's not and (70:42 - 70:46)
it's after playing it it is not it is (70:44 - 70:49)
not so i know you probably were watching (70:46 - 70:50)
your favorite content creators scream (70:49 - 70:52)
finally open world pokemon when they (70:50 - 70:54)
first showed that game here's the thing (70:52 - 70:55)
about open world games i said it on the (70:54 - 70:57)
podcast again uh i said on the podcast (70:55 - 70:59)
before i will say it again if your video (70:57 - 71:02)
game is open world you will make sure to (70:59 - 71:04)
tell the world it is open world because (71:02 - 71:06)
that is a selling point of your game and (71:04 - 71:08)
they knew that it was an open world and (71:06 - 71:10)
they knew that they couldn't say that (71:08 - 71:11)
without getting backlash (71:10 - 71:13)
so they didn't advertise legends arceus (71:11 - 71:16)
as open world because it's quite (71:13 - 71:18)
frankly it's not it's not um (71:16 - 71:20)
these games are uh and i don't know what (71:18 - 71:23)
that looks like but they say here along (71:20 - 71:25)
along with the series staples such as (71:23 - 71:27)
trading and battling pokemon players (71:25 - 71:28)
will be able to explore various (71:27 - 71:30)
locations in the region in these games (71:28 - 71:33)
with up to four players (71:30 - 71:34)
and there's a little cliff note here (71:33 - 71:36)
saying you know additional (71:34 - 71:38)
systems and accessories may be required (71:36 - 71:40)
for multiplayer mode game system and (71:38 - 71:41)
some accessories are sold separately (71:40 - 71:42)
obviously you'll probably need the (71:41 - 71:46)
nintendo online subscription (71:42 - 71:47)
um (71:46 - 71:50)
what made me laugh in the trailer (71:47 - 71:52)
is they say this they show all the (71:50 - 71:53)
people getting together and then the (71:52 - 71:55)
next shot is all of them leaving and i'm (71:53 - 71:57)
like (71:55 - 71:58)
i think we missed a part of them (71:57 - 72:01)
actually doing things together because (71:58 - 72:03)
they all ran and then they're like hi (72:01 - 72:06)
and then they all left well i so for me (72:03 - 72:08)
i took that to mean like (72:06 - 72:11)
you're you're in the same session (72:08 - 72:14)
but you can go to different areas while (72:11 - 72:16)
still staying in the same session you're (72:14 - 72:19)
not restricted to one small (72:16 - 72:21)
region of the map i thought it was just (72:19 - 72:22)
funny that they're like i thought it was (72:21 - 72:25)
funny i had the same thought greg did (72:22 - 72:27)
and i laughed (72:25 - 72:27)
i mean they did show trading (72:29 - 72:33)
yeah (72:31 - 72:33)
um (72:36 - 72:38)
i mean that's that's the the age-old (72:39 - 72:43)
question of (72:41 - 72:46)
what do you do in a multiplayer pokemon (72:43 - 72:47)
game and there there's been like (72:46 - 72:50)
fan-made multiplayer pokemon games and i (72:47 - 72:52)
don't want to name any uh specifically (72:50 - 72:55)
but i've seen some where there's just (72:52 - 72:57)
five trainers walking back and forth in (72:55 - 72:58)
the grass trying to find a shiny and (72:57 - 72:59)
it's like (72:58 - 73:02)
i guess that's kind of cool i mean (72:59 - 73:03)
you're not interacting you're not doing (73:02 - 73:05)
you're just going back and forth (73:03 - 73:07)
checking if it's shining going like it's (73:05 - 73:09)
not really (73:07 - 73:10)
like interacting and then we've seen (73:09 - 73:13)
other games such as temtem (73:10 - 73:16)
have this mmo (73:13 - 73:19)
slash online multiplayer feel but again (73:16 - 73:21)
the the it kind of comes back to the two (73:19 - 73:23)
things they mentioned (73:21 - 73:26)
trading and battling (73:23 - 73:27)
now in sword and shield you could do (73:26 - 73:29)
curry (73:27 - 73:31)
um and in brilliant diamond shining (73:29 - 73:32)
pearl you could do the underground but (73:31 - 73:35)
even that was like so like underground (73:32 - 73:36)
limited (73:35 - 73:38)
um like yeah like it was cool to help (73:36 - 73:40)
somebody dig and it was like very like (73:38 - 73:42)
the first time somebody's like pounding (73:40 - 73:44)
on your wall and you're like what is (73:42 - 73:45)
happening and like (73:44 - 73:47)
like it it's very novel and seeing (73:45 - 73:49)
somebody's secret bases (73:47 - 73:51)
should have been cooler than it was and (73:49 - 73:53)
for like it's like oh cool you have a (73:51 - 73:55)
bunch of statues guess what's in mine a (73:53 - 73:58)
bunch of statues (73:55 - 73:58)
like you could emote in the underground (73:59 - 74:03)
that was kind of cool but like it was (74:00 - 74:06)
very limited and in sword and shield (74:03 - 74:08)
you could find people (74:06 - 74:10)
on your friends list you could go in and (74:08 - 74:12)
out of a session (74:10 - 74:13)
like connect and disconnect until you (74:12 - 74:16)
eventually end up with where your friend (74:13 - 74:17)
is and you could see them on their bike (74:16 - 74:18)
and you could see them walking around (74:17 - 74:20)
and then you could join their tent and (74:18 - 74:21)
curry (74:20 - 74:23)
so it's not like there's this big jump (74:21 - 74:25)
like they've kind of been working at (74:23 - 74:27)
this online thing for quite a while (74:25 - 74:30)
um (74:27 - 74:32)
i i just i i (74:30 - 74:33)
as (74:32 - 74:36)
as much as i would love an open world (74:33 - 74:38)
co-op play the game with four people (74:36 - 74:40)
i just don't know what that looks like (74:38 - 74:42)
are we walking are greg and i walking (74:40 - 74:44)
into a gym together and then all of a (74:42 - 74:46)
sudden our sessions end he he does his (74:44 - 74:48)
gym battle i do my gym battle and then (74:46 - 74:50)
we come back out and then we're in the (74:48 - 74:52)
open world to do (74:50 - 74:53)
what (74:52 - 74:55)
trade battle why do why do you have no (74:53 - 74:57)
imagination especially (74:55 - 75:00)
i don't have their imagination okay here (74:57 - 75:02)
i'll give you five things that you can (75:00 - 75:06)
do open world four player just all right (75:02 - 75:08)
youtube video here we go five things (75:06 - 75:09)
you have (75:08 - 75:11)
number you have five minutes who can (75:09 - 75:14)
catch the the largest tallest pokemon (75:11 - 75:15)
because if we're gonna legends arceus (75:14 - 75:17)
the pokemon will have different heights (75:15 - 75:18)
and you can just go (75:17 - 75:22)
uh who can catch a specific pokemon that (75:18 - 75:24)
might be harder to find out in the wild (75:22 - 75:25)
or you'd have to know where to look for (75:24 - 75:26)
it (75:25 - 75:28)
uh who can catch the most pokemon in (75:26 - 75:30)
five minutes (75:28 - 75:31)
uh (75:30 - 75:33)
who can catch i don't know the fastest (75:31 - 75:35)
pokemon who can (75:33 - 75:37)
catch the lar well i already said the (75:35 - 75:40)
largest smallest pokemon there we go (75:37 - 75:42)
[Applause] (75:40 - 75:44)
or and i also thought (75:42 - 75:44)
uh (75:44 - 75:46)
racing (75:44 - 75:48)
you yeah who can get from here to here (75:46 - 75:50)
yeah the territory racing like racing (75:48 - 75:52)
would be a great thing to do (75:50 - 75:54)
right because they had the balloon (75:52 - 75:57)
popping correct right or who can hit uh (75:54 - 75:59)
a target with a pokemon (75:57 - 76:01)
den like areas (75:59 - 76:02)
will be better (76:01 - 76:04)
that was my other question is like the (76:02 - 76:06)
great multiplayer experience in sword (76:04 - 76:08)
and shield was raid battles and and (76:06 - 76:11)
dynamics adventure both are similar but (76:08 - 76:12)
both are different enough where you (76:11 - 76:14)
might want feel in the mood for one over (76:12 - 76:16)
the other (76:14 - 76:19)
um they were a great way to do with (76:16 - 76:21)
three other people (76:19 - 76:23)
i'm not saying that this needs to come (76:21 - 76:26)
back but a some form of (76:23 - 76:28)
four people working together to take (76:26 - 76:30)
down something hard (76:28 - 76:32)
and if (76:30 - 76:34)
me and three other people could walk (76:32 - 76:36)
here's the i think the thing would be (76:34 - 76:38)
let's let's go back to the original wild (76:36 - 76:40)
area in sword and shield (76:38 - 76:42)
and i (76:40 - 76:44)
am in a privileged position where i have (76:42 - 76:47)
an audience watching me on twitch (76:44 - 76:49)
and there's a lot of people so when i (76:47 - 76:51)
find a cool raid let's say i found (76:49 - 76:53)
gigantomax kingler that was very (76:51 - 76:55)
exciting the first like two weeks the (76:53 - 76:56)
game came out (76:55 - 76:58)
there's hundreds of people in the twitch (76:56 - 76:59)
chat being like can i please get into (76:58 - 77:01)
gigantomax kingler (76:59 - 77:03)
right and i (77:01 - 77:06)
you know set up the y com as bad as that (77:03 - 77:08)
was enter the code you know whoever (77:06 - 77:10)
enters it first gets in (77:08 - 77:11)
um (77:10 - 77:13)
and not a lot of people have that (77:11 - 77:14)
experience right because they're not (77:13 - 77:16)
they might not be twitch streamers or (77:14 - 77:19)
content creators or or whatnot (77:16 - 77:21)
but i think you could have the same (77:19 - 77:22)
effect (77:21 - 77:25)
um on like a discord call with people (77:22 - 77:27)
but i think you could have an even (77:25 - 77:29)
better effect where instead of (77:27 - 77:31)
everyone in their own instance looking (77:29 - 77:33)
at raids (77:31 - 77:35)
you could see those people look at raids (77:33 - 77:37)
or like in order to join they would have (77:35 - 77:39)
to run up to your raid (77:37 - 77:41)
and the four of you are standing around (77:39 - 77:43)
that raid in which is what the original (77:41 - 77:45)
trailer of sword and shield showed it (77:43 - 77:46)
showed four people standing around a (77:45 - 77:49)
raid to like do the raid together like i (77:46 - 77:51)
think that stuff is cool racing was (77:49 - 77:52)
always existed in pokemon there was the (77:51 - 77:54)
bike races and sword and shield there (77:52 - 77:55)
was all the racing and not racing but (77:54 - 77:58)
balloon popping and in legends arceus so (77:55 - 78:00)
being able to race (77:58 - 78:03)
against somebody on uh le chunk or uh (78:00 - 78:05)
kiradan (78:03 - 78:07)
um from point a to point b would be (78:05 - 78:09)
really cool and novel i think the curry (78:07 - 78:11)
stuff was great it was to me it was (78:09 - 78:13)
really great that the curry stuff had (78:11 - 78:16)
like a dex and you could trade curry (78:13 - 78:18)
ingredients to complete the decks i (78:16 - 78:19)
would love to see something like that (78:18 - 78:21)
return (78:19 - 78:22)
i'm just thinking of more ways to (78:21 - 78:24)
interact with people i'm not so (78:22 - 78:26)
interested that you you said uh go into (78:24 - 78:29)
a gym i i saw nothing in this trailer (78:26 - 78:31)
about gyms (78:29 - 78:32)
i (78:31 - 78:36)
have like a thought that (78:32 - 78:38)
would be interesting is that the gym or (78:36 - 78:41)
trial or whatever it would be would be (78:38 - 78:42)
different (78:41 - 78:43)
solo (78:42 - 78:45)
or and it would be a different (78:43 - 78:47)
experience multiplayer like the gym (78:45 - 78:49)
would change so that like if you're (78:47 - 78:51)
playing together four of you would go up (78:49 - 78:53)
and like okay let's try to take out this (78:51 - 78:55)
trial or jim and try to all get our (78:53 - 78:57)
badges i think that would be a really (78:55 - 79:00)
fun thing to do (78:57 - 79:01)
that would make multiplayer more (79:00 - 79:04)
interesting because they say the thing (79:01 - 79:07)
you can do stuff not (79:04 - 79:09)
dictated by the story so i feel like (79:07 - 79:12)
once we've decoupled (79:09 - 79:14)
badges from story progression which is (79:12 - 79:16)
kind of what they made it sound then i (79:14 - 79:18)
feel like they could be ripe to making (79:16 - 79:21)
those multiplayer experiences i think (79:18 - 79:24)
it's going to be (79:21 - 79:26)
i just that you're going to have the (79:24 - 79:28)
professor is going to give you research (79:26 - 79:31)
tasks and as you complete those research (79:28 - 79:34)
tasks you level up and no badges (79:31 - 79:36)
no gems no badges (79:34 - 79:38)
your school becomes stronger until you (79:36 - 79:41)
can crush your rivals i mean they show a (79:38 - 79:44)
arena yeah i mean they show (79:41 - 79:48)
they show areas that clearly are arenas (79:44 - 79:49)
or (79:48 - 79:52)
trial areas or possibly gyms (79:49 - 79:54)
i just think it'd be really interesting (79:52 - 79:56)
to have those be multiplayer optional (79:54 - 79:58)
one thing to keep in mind too in looking (79:56 - 80:01)
at those at like the arena and also the (79:58 - 80:02)
pokemon center (80:01 - 80:05)
they're outdoor (80:02 - 80:08)
places they're not indoors so right the (80:05 - 80:10)
concept of walk into a gym do you guys (80:08 - 80:12)
walk into two like different dimensions (80:10 - 80:14)
once you walk through the door there's (80:12 - 80:15)
no door (80:14 - 80:18)
in either of those places right (80:15 - 80:19)
i mean (80:18 - 80:21)
in this screenshot you see this this (80:19 - 80:23)
tower in a desert area and it's slightly (80:21 - 80:25)
tilted and there's three floors and you (80:23 - 80:27)
can see a ladder going up and then in (80:25 - 80:30)
the middle picture you see what looks to (80:27 - 80:33)
be the same arena except the very top of (80:30 - 80:34)
it where you see stairs and you see the (80:33 - 80:37)
gym or not the gym the the battlefield (80:34 - 80:39)
and you see a bunch of flowers but that (80:37 - 80:41)
doesn't look like it's from the first (80:39 - 80:42)
one (80:41 - 80:45)
and then the third shot is the racing (80:42 - 80:48)
flags which has like a star in the (80:45 - 80:50)
center and then fire and to me that (80:48 - 80:51)
would signify (80:50 - 80:55)
jim but fire jim right (80:51 - 80:57)
um so it it does look like there are (80:55 - 80:59)
gyms or trials of some sort it looks (80:57 - 81:01)
like the first one is possibly ground (80:59 - 81:02)
the second one is possibly grass the (81:01 - 81:04)
third one is fire (81:02 - 81:07)
um their their per their eye (81:04 - 81:09)
what's the word (81:07 - 81:10)
screenshots (81:09 - 81:13)
it was the ones that they tweeted or (81:10 - 81:14)
whatever i mean it's just from the (81:13 - 81:15)
trailer they just there's just stills (81:14 - 81:18)
from the trailer um one thing that i (81:15 - 81:20)
will say (81:18 - 81:20)
also could be interesting is so (81:20 - 81:24)
one thing that they're doing in final (81:23 - 81:26)
fantasy 14 is (81:24 - 81:28)
they are allowing you to do all the (81:26 - 81:32)
dungeons with npcs so you don't have to (81:28 - 81:35)
have a party so they could also do (81:32 - 81:37)
something similar here that you would (81:35 - 81:40)
have npcs like you did in (81:37 - 81:42)
raids like you could go in alone and (81:40 - 81:44)
just get three other randoms or you (81:42 - 81:47)
could do them with people so i can see (81:44 - 81:50)
that also happening with whatever these (81:47 - 81:53)
gyms or trials or (81:50 - 81:55)
whatever they're going to be that that (81:53 - 81:58)
they are multi-player events either with (81:55 - 82:02)
npcs or with your friends (81:58 - 82:02)
yeah i'm curious of how (82:05 - 82:10)
big (82:11 - 82:14)
this world will be (82:12 - 82:15)
and (82:14 - 82:17)
um (82:15 - 82:21)
i think legends is (82:17 - 82:21)
i think legends did a really good job at (82:21 - 82:25)
making it seem like this huge vast world (82:22 - 82:27)
and then once you got like weird deer or (82:25 - 82:30)
bravery you you quickly realized that (82:27 - 82:32)
it's it's not really that big (82:30 - 82:35)
um and obviously those tools are so you (82:32 - 82:36)
accelerate so you're not spending the (82:35 - 82:38)
entire time walking around and that's (82:36 - 82:40)
not necessarily a bad thing (82:38 - 82:41)
um but it kind of goes back to what i (82:40 - 82:43)
said at the beginning of the podcast (82:41 - 82:44)
why didn't they sell two versions of (82:43 - 82:45)
legends (82:44 - 82:48)
it's kind of because legends is not a (82:45 - 82:51)
big game yeah (82:48 - 82:54)
like it's pokedex is really small (82:51 - 82:57)
um there's only five trials however what (82:54 - 82:58)
do you want to call what i can't (82:57 - 82:59)
remember what they're called in legends (82:58 - 83:03)
like trials um totem not totems um (82:59 - 83:05)
oh gosh what is the name noble battles (83:03 - 83:07)
there's only five noble battles (83:05 - 83:10)
um there's like there's like 3.5 trainer (83:07 - 83:12)
battles in the entire game until you get (83:10 - 83:13)
to the end (83:12 - 83:15)
like it's it's a relatively small game (83:13 - 83:17)
so um and sword and shield is the (83:15 - 83:19)
opposite like sword and shield has all (83:17 - 83:22)
of these towns it has three huge wild (83:19 - 83:24)
areas (83:22 - 83:26)
um (83:24 - 83:27)
and (83:26 - 83:30)
but i but i think it does still feel (83:27 - 83:31)
that big because your only form of (83:30 - 83:33)
transportation in those wild areas is (83:31 - 83:34)
your bike (83:33 - 83:36)
um and between using weird deer and (83:34 - 83:39)
bravery you just tran you just (83:36 - 83:41)
move so much quicker (83:39 - 83:44)
and where you need to go (83:41 - 83:46)
um so i don't know i don't think like to (83:44 - 83:49)
me i don't think like oh this world is (83:46 - 83:51)
not as big as a sword and shield because (83:49 - 83:52)
they're trying open world for the first (83:51 - 83:54)
time therefore it's bad like if it's a (83:52 - 83:55)
bit smaller than sword and shield but (83:54 - 83:58)
still like open world and like i think (83:55 - 84:00)
of the i think of isle of armor for the (83:58 - 84:01)
first time and i think isle of armor was (84:00 - 84:03)
the first time (84:01 - 84:04)
i was like this is what the wild area (84:03 - 84:06)
the isle of armor was indeed the time (84:04 - 84:08)
where i was like i wish the wild area (84:06 - 84:10)
was this to begin with because when you (84:08 - 84:13)
go from the dojo around into the swamp (84:10 - 84:14)
and the swamp leads into the forest and (84:13 - 84:16)
you see the pokemon in the trees and (84:14 - 84:18)
then you come out of the beach and then (84:16 - 84:20)
you go into like the cave like isle of (84:18 - 84:22)
armor had such a (84:20 - 84:24)
varying environments (84:22 - 84:26)
that it felt (84:24 - 84:28)
like you were exploring something cool (84:26 - 84:30)
whereas i look at i think of the first (84:28 - 84:32)
area in legends and i think of the (84:30 - 84:36)
original wild area and it was like (84:32 - 84:39)
the big but samey (84:36 - 84:41)
um (84:39 - 84:43)
like i don't even think legends had like (84:41 - 84:46)
anything like in the trees like the isle (84:43 - 84:48)
of armor did not that that like makes or (84:46 - 84:49)
break a game but it's like it was cool (84:48 - 84:51)
to like look up and be like oh there's a (84:49 - 84:53)
pika peck in this no not pika pike but (84:51 - 84:54)
there's like oh pidgey in this tree or (84:53 - 84:57)
whatever (84:54 - 84:57)
i don't know i would almost sacrifice (84:57 - 85:01)
like (84:59 - 85:03)
the size of something (85:01 - 85:05)
for (85:03 - 85:08)
something that feels (85:05 - 85:09)
more (85:08 - 85:11)
no pun intended but more like (85:09 - 85:14)
handcrafted (85:11 - 85:14)
and i i think (85:14 - 85:18)
to use another game for an example i (85:16 - 85:20)
would use final fantasy xv which i adore (85:18 - 85:23)
that game love that game there's (85:20 - 85:24)
something about four dudes and leather (85:23 - 85:27)
pushing a car to the song stand by me (85:24 - 85:29)
which really like hooked me into that (85:27 - 85:32)
game and that game was open world right (85:29 - 85:34)
you could go anywhere you wanted (85:32 - 85:37)
like legit if you sat like i'm not (85:34 - 85:38)
exaggerating and if you've never played (85:37 - 85:40)
final fantasy 15 let me point out a (85:38 - 85:42)
scenario to you if you're in the main (85:40 - 85:43)
town (85:42 - 85:45)
and you want to go south to the beach (85:43 - 85:48)
you could walk there on foot it would (85:45 - 85:49)
probably (85:48 - 85:52)
take 45 minutes to do so (85:49 - 85:54)
or you could take the car (85:52 - 85:56)
because you have a car in that game and (85:54 - 85:57)
you could tell the car to go on (85:56 - 86:00)
autopilot and the car would probably (85:57 - 86:02)
take no exaggeration 10 minutes to drive (86:00 - 86:04)
there there was no way there was no fast (86:02 - 86:05)
travel (86:04 - 86:08)
so i would get up and go to the bathroom (86:05 - 86:11)
or make a sandwich or like browse (86:08 - 86:14)
twitter because the car would legit take (86:11 - 86:17)
10 minutes to drive from point a to (86:14 - 86:19)
point b and you watch the car and it (86:17 - 86:21)
turned into like a screen saver but the (86:19 - 86:24)
map was that big but the the problem (86:21 - 86:27)
with final fantasy 15 is the open world (86:24 - 86:29)
was such an afterthought there was no (86:27 - 86:31)
reason to do it you i (86:29 - 86:32)
i (86:31 - 86:34)
almost fell off the game completely (86:32 - 86:35)
because i was trying to explore the open (86:34 - 86:37)
world and i would get i would walk 10 (86:35 - 86:40)
minutes into a desert find this creature (86:37 - 86:43)
defeat it get like this ring and be like (86:40 - 86:45)
oh cool i came all the way out here (86:43 - 86:47)
found a ring cool walked 10 minutes back (86:45 - 86:48)
to town and then realized they just sold (86:47 - 86:50)
the ring in the store for 500 gems or (86:48 - 86:53)
whatever i was like well why did why why (86:50 - 86:54)
did why did i spend 20 minutes to get (86:53 - 86:56)
this ring when i could just buy why did (86:54 - 86:58)
you waste my time why was this ring not (86:56 - 86:59)
unique (86:58 - 87:00)
and (86:59 - 87:03)
so i and i don't subscribe to like oh (87:00 - 87:04)
all open world games are automatic (87:03 - 87:06)
automatically good like i think final (87:04 - 87:08)
fantasy 15 is a fantastic game but it (87:06 - 87:09)
was fantastic because i stuck to the (87:08 - 87:11)
linear story that it was telling and (87:09 - 87:14)
anytime i went out to explore i just (87:11 - 87:17)
felt like it was wasting my time and it (87:14 - 87:19)
wasn't fun to actually explore that on (87:17 - 87:21)
the flip side i think of breathal wild (87:19 - 87:23)
where you walk 10 minutes to do (87:21 - 87:25)
something and i feel like you're always (87:23 - 87:26)
rewarded for that (87:25 - 87:28)
and i think a lot of people share that (87:26 - 87:30)
same thoughts with breath of the wild of (87:28 - 87:32)
like it's why it's a good open world (87:30 - 87:33)
game because you could see you see (87:32 - 87:35)
something you walk to it and something (87:33 - 87:37)
is actually (87:35 - 87:38)
there (87:37 - 87:40)
well dude that's the problem you see (87:38 - 87:42)
something you say something (87:40 - 87:44)
well this is what i can guarantee i will (87:42 - 87:46)
give you the will anderson guarantee (87:44 - 87:49)
about the open world in pokemon scarlet (87:46 - 87:52)
and violet if you are ready to hear this (87:49 - 87:55)
never ready but go for it it will be (87:52 - 87:58)
smaller than we want it to be (87:55 - 88:02)
but larger than we expect yeah that's (87:58 - 88:03)
all right probably the most accurate (88:02 - 88:06)
thing you've said on the ship excuse me (88:03 - 88:07)
i've said a lot of accurate things (88:06 - 88:08)
that's true you were right about the (88:07 - 88:11)
past and future thing (88:08 - 88:14)
um (88:11 - 88:14)
i i wonder if it will be the same like (88:15 - 88:20)
i think (88:19 - 88:22)
i think of i think of the pokemon fans (88:20 - 88:24)
that are like i love heart gold soul (88:22 - 88:25)
silver because you can kind of pick (88:24 - 88:27)
where you go (88:25 - 88:27)
and it's (88:28 - 88:30)
it's (88:28 - 88:32)
it's like an illusion it's not real (88:30 - 88:34)
in order to pick where you have to go (88:32 - 88:37)
they had to like weaken everything and (88:34 - 88:39)
and like make all the gym leaders the (88:37 - 88:41)
same level and it didn't like (88:39 - 88:44)
work um and i recently watched a youtube (88:41 - 88:47)
video by uh dunkey (88:44 - 88:50)
and it was for um (88:47 - 88:52)
uh link's awakening does still making (88:50 - 88:54)
videos he's still making videos and (88:52 - 88:56)
what's funny is links awakening came out (88:54 - 88:58)
over a year ago greg and i played it (88:56 - 89:01)
when nintendo invited us out to play it (88:58 - 89:04)
right at uh pax west like (89:01 - 89:06)
this was before covent where greg and i (89:04 - 89:08)
played link's awakening and he just did (89:06 - 89:10)
a video about links awakening and he (89:08 - 89:12)
loves the game he he talks about how he (89:10 - 89:13)
beat it three times and it's one of his (89:12 - 89:15)
favorite games but he also talked about (89:13 - 89:18)
a thing that i think a lot of people (89:15 - 89:20)
miss in most video games where they give (89:18 - 89:24)
you this illusion of of this open world (89:20 - 89:26)
and he talks about how link's awakening (89:24 - 89:28)
gives this illusion of like you're in (89:26 - 89:30)
this big open world but because you can (89:28 - 89:33)
only get items in a certain way you're (89:30 - 89:34)
kind of (89:33 - 89:37)
on a linear path the entire time it just (89:34 - 89:38)
seems like you're walking around this (89:37 - 89:40)
world being able to do what you want but (89:38 - 89:42)
you're restricted by how the game (89:40 - 89:45)
dictates where you go next (89:42 - 89:46)
um (89:45 - 89:47)
and that's that was hardcode soul silver (89:46 - 89:49)
like there's a point in the game where (89:47 - 89:51)
it branches out and yeah i guess you (89:49 - 89:54)
could do gyarados before you do uh chuck (89:51 - 89:57)
but like you are still restricted there (89:54 - 89:58)
like (89:57 - 90:00)
yeah you can do one thing over the other (89:58 - 90:01)
but (90:00 - 90:04)
it doesn't it doesn't feel rewarding in (90:01 - 90:07)
a way where it's like (90:04 - 90:09)
you're just over leveled at that point (90:07 - 90:10)
right because they can't not make you (90:09 - 90:12)
over leveled (90:10 - 90:14)
because they gave you that choice so i'm (90:12 - 90:16)
not i don't think i'm worried (90:14 - 90:18)
um (90:16 - 90:19)
obviously they probably thought of a (90:18 - 90:22)
system to be like (90:19 - 90:23)
well you have to do this and then you (90:22 - 90:25)
have to do this and then you have to do (90:23 - 90:26)
this (90:25 - 90:29)
uh i think uh the other thing that (90:26 - 90:32)
people have always speculated is (90:29 - 90:33)
it doesn't matter what order you do the (90:32 - 90:36)
gyms in but the gyms scale to where you (90:33 - 90:38)
at you're at so if you do brock's gym (90:36 - 90:41)
first he's level 10 and 12 (90:38 - 90:43)
but if you decide to do brock's gym (90:41 - 90:47)
fourth he's level 35 and 37 (90:43 - 90:49)
which i think is an easy solution to (90:47 - 90:50)
that (90:49 - 90:51)
yeah um (90:50 - 90:53)
but who knows if that's even going to be (90:51 - 90:55)
a thing (90:53 - 90:55)
here's the way i saved the best for last (90:59 - 91:05)
we have now confirmed quaxley's (91:01 - 91:07)
hair is indeed his hair of feathers and (91:05 - 91:10)
not an actual hat (91:07 - 91:12)
thank goodness (91:10 - 91:14)
thank goodness boo and thank you to all (91:12 - 91:16)
the artists out there making incredible (91:14 - 91:20)
quixly art (91:16 - 91:20)
i'm very i'm very into all the quackley (91:20 - 91:25)
art um the issue is is now that there's (91:23 - 91:28)
a heavy motorcycle feel quacks is going (91:25 - 91:30)
to grope and to be greaser and i'm (91:28 - 91:32)
already worried i'm so (91:30 - 91:35)
much more into this (91:32 - 91:37)
i'm fue coco all the way now and it's (91:35 - 91:39)
like why do i have to have another start (91:37 - 91:43)
with another fire type but here we go (91:39 - 91:45)
um (91:43 - 91:47)
overall (91:45 - 91:50)
way the game looks so far i think is (91:47 - 91:51)
fantastic (91:50 - 91:55)
um like if you look at the shot of nia (91:51 - 91:57)
oh sorry not india yeah neil was the (91:55 - 91:59)
crown tundra if you look at the shot of (91:57 - 92:01)
pneumonia of like you can see the (91:59 - 92:03)
texture in her shirt (92:01 - 92:05)
um the pokeball looks really great her (92:03 - 92:08)
hair looks video game hair is always (92:05 - 92:13)
weird but her hair looks very good um (92:08 - 92:13)
i i i like (92:14 - 92:18)
how the game looks aesthetically like i (92:16 - 92:22)
love these futuristic motorcycle (92:18 - 92:26)
diner pokemon centers that are happening (92:22 - 92:28)
i like all the flowers (92:26 - 92:30)
i like the spanish (92:28 - 92:32)
themes that they have without what are (92:30 - 92:34)
those like the tiles that are like (92:32 - 92:36)
different colors i'm not sure there's a (92:34 - 92:37)
word for those (92:36 - 92:41)
like a like a mural uh like you know (92:37 - 92:42)
when you look in the pool where (92:41 - 92:43)
quacksley is it's like orange purple (92:42 - 92:45)
white orange they're like little squares (92:43 - 92:48)
mosaic it's like a yeah (92:45 - 92:50)
i like that that's scattered throughout (92:48 - 92:51)
the region (92:50 - 92:53)
um (92:51 - 92:55)
the little kid with the toro shirt and (92:53 - 92:57)
the yeah the guitar shirt is so good the (92:55 - 93:00)
pokeball overalls and you can see the (92:57 - 93:00)
details (93:00 - 93:03)
suspenders suspenders (93:00 - 93:05)
you can see the like the the (93:03 - 93:06)
the (93:05 - 93:09)
corduroy detail in his shorts (93:06 - 93:10)
um (93:09 - 93:15)
that kid's a style icon let's be real (93:10 - 93:16)
i think this might be the first pokemon (93:15 - 93:19)
game where you can switch between pants (93:16 - 93:21)
and shorts (93:19 - 93:25)
in sun and moon only shorts (93:21 - 93:27)
in x and y only pants and i'm pretty (93:25 - 93:29)
sure in (93:27 - 93:31)
i mean the climates are different in (93:29 - 93:33)
those regions i'm pretty sure in sword (93:31 - 93:35)
and shield only pants (93:33 - 93:36)
oh no you could have shorts oh you can (93:35 - 93:38)
you could you could have the jersey (93:36 - 93:39)
outfits those would give you shorts yeah (93:38 - 93:41)
but yeah okay (93:39 - 93:43)
because we see two trainers with pants (93:41 - 93:44)
two trainers with shorts (93:43 - 93:45)
um (93:44 - 93:46)
i (93:45 - 93:49)
i think the the there is a lot of detail (93:46 - 93:52)
here in the trainers and they look great (93:49 - 93:53)
um (93:52 - 93:56)
there are the the rocks in the (93:53 - 93:57)
background i actually do think look (93:56 - 93:59)
great look there's a shot of the the (93:57 - 94:02)
black girl throwing a poke ball and you (93:59 - 94:03)
can see the pokemon center in the (94:02 - 94:04)
background and the rock texture back (94:03 - 94:06)
there looks really really great (94:04 - 94:08)
um (94:06 - 94:09)
i'm curious if this is running the same (94:08 - 94:12)
engine legends's (94:09 - 94:12)
uh (94:13 - 94:16)
or a modified version of what legend i (94:14 - 94:18)
want to say it's probably modified i (94:16 - 94:19)
don't know (94:18 - 94:20)
i don't (94:19 - 94:22)
i don't know the programming i mean they (94:20 - 94:25)
do have in the trailer (94:22 - 94:28)
the sort of sneaking up (94:25 - 94:32)
motion that was in legends (94:28 - 94:32)
yeah (94:33 - 94:36)
but i don't know if that means you can (94:34 - 94:37)
sneak up and catch like in legends or if (94:36 - 94:39)
you sneak up and then you get a bonus (94:37 - 94:41)
when you go into battle yeah i think (94:39 - 94:43)
it's 100 you're gonna be sneaking up and (94:41 - 94:46)
catching like in legends because yeah i (94:43 - 94:48)
think so too i i think the legends (94:46 - 94:51)
i think eighty percent strong chance but (94:48 - 94:54)
there's always that 20 they're like nah (94:51 - 94:56)
they just go in like always i mean i (94:54 - 94:58)
think they're purposely not showing it (94:56 - 95:00)
right i think so too i think they're (94:58 - 95:03)
hinting at it and being coy about it (95:00 - 95:05)
the thing that i think bothered me with (95:03 - 95:07)
legends the most graphically (95:05 - 95:10)
is the game looked so washed out at (95:07 - 95:14)
times and so brown and i was an artistic (95:10 - 95:17)
the color palette was unfortunate (95:14 - 95:19)
and that's why i think i'm like (95:17 - 95:21)
i i know i like i made a tic-tac making (95:19 - 95:23)
fun of the bush and you can look at some (95:21 - 95:24)
of these and be like other grounds not (95:23 - 95:25)
that great or the flowers aren't that (95:24 - 95:27)
great and that's fine whatever like i (95:25 - 95:28)
played pokemon games so long in the 3ds (95:27 - 95:30)
that stuff actually doesn't bother me i (95:28 - 95:33)
just think it's funny that you know (95:30 - 95:35)
we we had one long conversation about (95:33 - 95:36)
trees (95:35 - 95:37)
um (95:36 - 95:39)
but i think the thing that like i said (95:37 - 95:40)
the thing that bothered me with legends (95:39 - 95:44)
was the color palette and (95:40 - 95:45)
they (95:44 - 95:47)
somebody at game freak or whoever made (95:45 - 95:49)
that game (95:47 - 95:51)
did not understand how lighting worked (95:49 - 95:54)
oh absolutely pokemon would look (95:51 - 95:56)
incredible in one instance and then you (95:54 - 95:57)
would turn the camera and the sun would (95:56 - 95:58)
reflect and you'd be like this game (95:57 - 96:01)
looks like hot and garbage right now i i (95:58 - 96:03)
don't know how they messed the lighting (96:01 - 96:05)
up in legends so bad but my one of my (96:03 - 96:07)
two biggest complaints is the (96:05 - 96:10)
really muddy color pilot and (96:07 - 96:12)
i still don't know what they're doing (96:10 - 96:14)
with the light i still don't understand (96:12 - 96:17)
it and i feel like somebody (96:14 - 96:21)
at game freak thought the same as as us (96:17 - 96:22)
because i felt like this trailer (96:21 - 96:26)
showcased lighting in an incredible way (96:22 - 96:28)
i think (96:26 - 96:29)
what impressed me about the trailer is (96:28 - 96:32)
just that everything seemed bright and (96:29 - 96:35)
varied even when they cut to the various (96:32 - 96:36)
like (96:35 - 96:38)
clearly you're going into a cavern it (96:36 - 96:40)
still felt (96:38 - 96:42)
bright and not (96:40 - 96:43)
muddied (96:42 - 96:46)
um and that that got me more excited (96:43 - 96:48)
about (96:46 - 96:50)
generally just sort of how the (96:48 - 96:51)
[Music] (96:50 - 96:54)
game will feel because like there's a (96:51 - 96:55)
cave picture and i'm like they're (96:54 - 96:58)
already in this cave pictures multiple (96:55 - 97:00)
colors multiple levels it is the same (96:58 - 97:03)
palette but it's not muddy (97:00 - 97:07)
there's there's a picture of um (97:03 - 97:08)
lechonk (97:07 - 97:10)
and and (97:08 - 97:12)
if you look at it you're like oh the the (97:10 - 97:16)
the grass is very polygonal and the tree (97:12 - 97:17)
looks bad or whatever make whatever (97:16 - 97:20)
excuse you want but then i look at it (97:17 - 97:21)
and i'm like (97:20 - 97:24)
he's in the shade under the tree and you (97:21 - 97:26)
can still see the sun reflecting off the (97:24 - 97:28)
terrain in the background like that's (97:26 - 97:29)
actually like (97:28 - 97:31)
really great (97:29 - 97:33)
and i don't i don't know if you could (97:31 - 97:35)
stand under a tree in legends and feel (97:33 - 97:38)
like you were in the shade (97:35 - 97:39)
because (97:38 - 97:41)
because boy that game did not know how (97:39 - 97:42)
the sun worked (97:41 - 97:45)
but the same with smoliv like like these (97:42 - 97:47)
pokemon have like shadows and stuff look (97:45 - 97:49)
i know there are like tree shadings and (97:47 - 97:52)
stuff in legends i'm just i just think (97:49 - 97:54)
that they like (97:52 - 97:56)
figured it out better here they got they (97:54 - 97:57)
have it better and (97:56 - 98:00)
when when (97:57 - 98:00)
it looks natural (98:00 - 98:05)
you don't really think about it like you (98:03 - 98:06)
could look at this picture of le chunk (98:05 - 98:08)
and be like oh yeah it's a pig in the (98:06 - 98:10)
shade under a tree yeah that's that's (98:08 - 98:11)
natural (98:10 - 98:13)
but when it doesn't look natural then (98:11 - 98:16)
you go oh this looks bad because this is (98:13 - 98:18)
not what my eye is used to and i think (98:16 - 98:20)
that was like a lot of the complaints of (98:18 - 98:23)
legends of like graphically of like (98:20 - 98:25)
this is my eye is not okay with what i'm (98:23 - 98:26)
seeing (98:25 - 98:27)
because this is not how shading or (98:26 - 98:29)
lighting works (98:27 - 98:31)
and so it looks bad (98:29 - 98:32)
i'm just looking at that cutie under the (98:31 - 98:33)
tree (98:32 - 98:35)
he's he's really great uh and then like (98:33 - 98:37)
the four trainers walking away from each (98:35 - 98:39)
other and the shadows and the sun and (98:37 - 98:41)
everything looks bright but not bright (98:39 - 98:43)
enough where things look washed out (98:41 - 98:46)
i think what gave me a lot of hope is (98:43 - 98:48)
the flower scene (98:46 - 98:51)
uh for sprigga tito (98:48 - 98:53)
because all the flowers really popped (98:51 - 98:56)
they looked (98:53 - 98:56)
i know it just looked bright and (98:57 - 99:02)
colorful and i'm like this is where i (99:00 - 99:05)
want to get back to not muddy (99:02 - 99:07)
and one note i want it to be bright and (99:05 - 99:10)
colorful and they like that shot in the (99:07 - 99:13)
flower garden i'm like yes (99:10 - 99:17)
this is this makes me happy (99:13 - 99:19)
and also the other ones are on (99:17 - 99:21)
multi-colored tiles like it's just got a (99:19 - 99:23)
nice (99:21 - 99:27)
bright feel to it that i'm happy about (99:23 - 99:28)
um (99:27 - 99:29)
there's also like detail in the (99:28 - 99:31)
character's backpack so you can like see (99:29 - 99:33)
zippers you can see (99:31 - 99:35)
um like uh carabiner or whatever they're (99:33 - 99:37)
called you can see the buckles (99:35 - 99:38)
i (99:37 - 99:40)
i'm not gonna sit here and defend the (99:38 - 99:42)
game freak for being the best in (99:40 - 99:43)
graphics you look at a game like mario (99:42 - 99:45)
odyssey you look at a game like animal (99:43 - 99:48)
crossing and there they dotted their (99:45 - 99:50)
eyes and crossed their t's when it comes (99:48 - 99:52)
to like that kind of stuff (99:50 - 99:52)
um (99:52 - 99:53)
[Music] (99:52 - 99:56)
game freak not so much but i mean (99:53 - 99:58)
there there are certain things like like (99:56 - 100:01)
the thing that makes me laugh is (99:58 - 100:03)
final fantasy 14 all the grass is (100:01 - 100:04)
terrible (100:03 - 100:06)
because it's (100:04 - 100:09)
it is computer code generated it's not (100:06 - 100:10)
drawn (100:09 - 100:12)
and so one of the things they're doing (100:10 - 100:15)
right now is going back and drawing all (100:12 - 100:17)
the graphs from scratch (100:15 - 100:19)
because the shortcut was to just have (100:17 - 100:21)
the computer do it and it always looked (100:19 - 100:24)
bad like it's been a common joke in this (100:21 - 100:26)
huge game that runs (100:24 - 100:28)
very powerful graphics that their grass (100:26 - 100:30)
is awful (100:28 - 100:32)
because they had a computer do it and i (100:30 - 100:34)
think that some of what we see in these (100:32 - 100:37)
trailers and other things is like (100:34 - 100:39)
this may just be them saying throw code (100:37 - 100:40)
in so there's (100:39 - 100:42)
ground and we'll go in and actually draw (100:40 - 100:45)
it in later like well i think it all (100:42 - 100:47)
budgets (100:45 - 100:47)
when you don't have to redo 900 pokemon (100:47 - 100:53)
every game (100:50 - 100:55)
you can be like hey instead of me (100:53 - 100:58)
spending three days on on fixing (100:55 - 100:59)
gyarados (100:58 - 101:01)
i can spend a day (100:59 - 101:04)
fixing the backpacks that you're going (101:01 - 101:05)
to be looking at the entire time i'm (101:04 - 101:07)
going to spend a day i'm going to spend (101:05 - 101:09)
an extra couple days on these clothes (101:07 - 101:11)
i'm going to be able to put scales on (101:09 - 101:12)
saver (101:11 - 101:14)
and know that (101:12 - 101:15)
it might take me look i don't know how (101:14 - 101:18)
long it takes it like if it says hey i'm (101:15 - 101:19)
going to go back and do some viper it's (101:18 - 101:21)
going to take a week guess what so viper (101:19 - 101:23)
is going to look this good it that it (101:21 - 101:25)
does now in all future games and i don't (101:23 - 101:27)
have to worry about arbok because we'll (101:25 - 101:29)
worry about arbok in three years when we (101:27 - 101:31)
bring it back our bach (101:29 - 101:34)
um a couple other things like there's a (101:31 - 101:36)
there's a drift loon sticker and a hat (101:34 - 101:38)
tenno sticker and a flapple sticker in (101:36 - 101:39)
in the girls room (101:38 - 101:42)
um there are a couple other pokemon (101:39 - 101:44)
symbols scattered out that doesn't (101:42 - 101:45)
really guarantee those pokemon are in (101:44 - 101:47)
the game um in sword and shield it (101:45 - 101:51)
opened with like a fletch fletchling uh (101:47 - 101:53)
like wind thing on the the roof (101:51 - 101:56)
fletching uh talonflame line wasn't (101:53 - 101:58)
added until (101:56 - 101:59)
i think crown (101:58 - 102:02)
tundra i mean they refer to things often (101:59 - 102:06)
like there could be it would be wild (102:02 - 102:10)
in a spanish region to not have (102:06 - 102:12)
tauros (102:10 - 102:14)
you can kind of look at the toro shirt (102:12 - 102:15)
and go (102:14 - 102:18)
okay yeah it's also sort of like people (102:15 - 102:19)
are like people are trying to calm me (102:18 - 102:20)
down they're like if you don't think (102:19 - 102:23)
they're gonna put roses in spain (102:20 - 102:24)
i'm like look (102:23 - 102:26)
polti geist doesn't learn scald i will (102:24 - 102:29)
make no predictions about what they do (102:26 - 102:31)
or don't do there are certain symbols (102:29 - 102:33)
lilly pup wasn't in sword and shield (102:31 - 102:36)
right is that not a british dog (102:33 - 102:39)
well no uh (102:36 - 102:39)
oh snubble is yes nebulous neville and (102:39 - 102:44)
are and they yeah there's like they do (102:42 - 102:47)
make wild choices lunatone and soul rock (102:44 - 102:49)
are not in sun and moon it's very (102:47 - 102:52)
possible if rosalia isn't in these games (102:49 - 102:53)
i'm not buying them (102:52 - 102:55)
that's not it's understandable you want (102:53 - 102:58)
to ride those motorcycles i i don't care (102:55 - 103:01)
about motorcycles i'm going to ride (102:58 - 103:03)
her all over again (103:01 - 103:06)
[Music] (103:03 - 103:06)
i think we could easily go on for (103:06 - 103:10)
another hour about stuff but there is (103:08 - 103:13)
next week knowing so yes (103:10 - 103:14)
there is next week if there's here's (103:13 - 103:15)
what we'll do we're not going to do (103:14 - 103:16)
question of the week this week but we (103:15 - 103:18)
did have really good questions on (103:16 - 103:19)
youtube um (103:18 - 103:20)
if (103:19 - 103:21)
you (103:20 - 103:23)
i kind of want to do i'm kind of (103:21 - 103:25)
expecting no (103:23 - 103:28)
news in the next week because they just (103:25 - 103:30)
did this and go fest is happening (103:28 - 103:32)
tomorrow (103:30 - 103:34)
uh hopefully you had a good go fest (103:32 - 103:36)
uh if you're watching on youtube (103:34 - 103:38)
i would like you and you made it this (103:36 - 103:39)
far first off thank you i would like you (103:38 - 103:40)
to comment what you want us to talk (103:39 - 103:42)
about whether that's the lore whether (103:40 - 103:44)
that's a certain pokemon whether that's (103:42 - 103:47)
graphics whether that's your theories (103:44 - 103:50)
because if there is no huge news i would (103:47 - 103:52)
love to hear what you guys say and then (103:50 - 103:54)
us be able to like talk about this (103:52 - 103:56)
because i'm sure there's stuff we missed (103:54 - 103:59)
i'm sure there's like box art stuff or (103:56 - 104:01)
there's a lot of that (103:59 - 104:03)
just for time right like we can't hit (104:01 - 104:04)
everything (104:03 - 104:06)
um so that's that's your if you're (104:04 - 104:08)
watching on youtube feel free to comment (104:06 - 104:10)
that um before we wrap up though (104:08 - 104:12)
pokemon of the week (104:10 - 104:15)
so last week's pokemon uh there was (104:12 - 104:16)
really only one thing you had to pay (104:15 - 104:19)
attention to even though i gave a huge (104:16 - 104:21)
number of lots of clues (104:19 - 104:24)
uh the key thing you had that would make (104:21 - 104:26)
it super easy for you is uh the phrase (104:24 - 104:28)
even though i believe it should be water (104:26 - 104:30)
electric type which would be next in (104:28 - 104:31)
order (104:30 - 104:35)
to this week's pokemon (104:31 - 104:35)
but also some things that could have (104:35 - 104:42)
helped you out is that it is similar to (104:38 - 104:44)
other pokemon that are made up of (104:42 - 104:46)
multiple creatures as opposed to a (104:44 - 104:48)
single creature (104:46 - 104:49)
which if you didn't get that i was (104:48 - 104:51)
referencing execute (104:49 - 104:53)
in there well (104:51 - 104:56)
think harder what can i say (104:53 - 105:00)
so which pokemon in order comes before a (104:56 - 105:02)
pokemon that i think should be water (105:00 - 105:04)
electric type (105:02 - 105:07)
it's (105:04 - 105:07)
squirtle (105:07 - 105:11)
no (105:10 - 105:13)
[Music] (105:11 - 105:17)
wartortle should be water electric (105:13 - 105:19)
there's probably a delta card with water (105:17 - 105:20)
electric (105:19 - 105:22)
i'm sure felix greg is correct it is (105:20 - 105:24)
phalanx there's no shuffle icon (105:22 - 105:27)
sorry is there a shiny (105:24 - 105:29)
uh there is but it's not loading but i (105:27 - 105:30)
know what the shiny looks because isn't (105:29 - 105:32)
it brown it looks like yeah brown (105:30 - 105:33)
shields it's a good fit it's a good one (105:32 - 105:36)
when i was uh in saint louis at the (105:33 - 105:38)
gazebo there was a guy who came up and (105:36 - 105:40)
he was like anyone got faith like he did (105:38 - 105:42)
talk like that he was like anyone got (105:40 - 105:44)
failings (105:42 - 105:46)
and you guys just you're just trying to (105:44 - 105:49)
trade people for low (105:46 - 105:52)
attack failings for gbl because the (105:49 - 105:54)
stats reroll when you trade in pogo (105:52 - 105:55)
um (105:54 - 105:57)
and failings isn't a special trade so (105:55 - 105:58)
you could trade as many as you wanted (105:57 - 106:01)
but he was he was looking for failings (105:58 - 106:02)
and i was like (106:01 - 106:05)
when he said that i was like oh yeah (106:02 - 106:07)
that's a pokemon (106:05 - 106:10)
i forgot that failing (106:07 - 106:10)
i just forgot it was in pogo like i just (106:10 - 106:14)
like (106:13 - 106:15)
uh (106:14 - 106:17)
oh i was like oh we have that in pogo (106:15 - 106:19)
wasn't in pogo standing straight up like (106:17 - 106:21)
this for a while yes they had to disable (106:19 - 106:23)
it like following you for like a couple (106:21 - 106:24)
days because it would like stand (106:23 - 106:27)
straight up (106:24 - 106:29)
i was like (106:27 - 106:31)
why remove that that's a feature that's (106:29 - 106:34)
good yeah it is a good bug brown and (106:31 - 106:36)
yellow instead of yellow and red the (106:34 - 106:38)
shiny is brown and yellow it's cute (106:36 - 106:41)
uh what about next week all right last (106:38 - 106:43)
week i was of the mistaken understanding (106:41 - 106:45)
that only galler had pokedex sequences (106:43 - 106:47)
that were out of order between national (106:45 - 106:50)
and regional pokedex but while i was (106:47 - 106:51)
researching this week's pokemon i (106:50 - 106:53)
realized that was (106:51 - 106:56)
incorrect this numerical resequency of (106:53 - 106:59)
resequencing occurs in remake games that (106:56 - 107:01)
include the full (106:59 - 107:04)
up to that point pokedex as some pokemon (107:01 - 107:07)
like galad get inserted with gardevar (107:04 - 107:09)
even though it is almost 200 slots away (107:07 - 107:11)
in the national pokedex (107:09 - 107:13)
in terms of number this week's pokemon (107:11 - 107:16)
falls somewhere between the snes (107:13 - 107:17)
otherwise pronounced snez and the (107:16 - 107:20)
gamecube the other thing to know is that (107:17 - 107:22)
even though it has been over a year (107:20 - 107:24)
since this pokemon could be featured on (107:22 - 107:26)
a tcg cardigan (107:24 - 107:30)
it has not been featured (107:26 - 107:30)
i think this is the first time venonat (107:33 - 107:37)
is in a national pokedex or like (107:34 - 107:40)
it's counting remakes since some time (107:37 - 107:43)
yes yeah yeah uh there was uh masuda (107:40 - 107:45)
leaving game freak to work at the (107:43 - 107:47)
pokemon company that's your subtle (107:45 - 107:48)
reminder that these are two different (107:47 - 107:50)
companies we will talk about that next (107:48 - 107:53)
week though because i think (107:50 - 107:54)
i think that's both good and bad but (107:53 - 107:56)
we'll talk about that next week (107:54 - 107:57)
um (107:56 - 107:59)
and we didn't talk about whether there (107:57 - 108:01)
will be different size variants or (107:59 - 108:02)
alphas or anything like that the trailer (108:01 - 108:04)
kind of hinted at that we will talk (108:02 - 108:06)
about that next week um hopefully you (108:04 - 108:08)
