[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 390 eighth episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I am your host spj very tired just got off a flight hopefully not sitting as that no it wasn't the jet set it was only like a two-hour flight it's just the no sleep before the flight you were on a jet yeah a member of the set of people who were on a jet you're a jet setting oh you are jet-setting across the country visiting places not going to pax where do you think that term came from I know jet lag is because the time difference makes me nobody said jet lag buddy be suggests a jet jet radio will is here and I just have one request slash announcement to make announcement it is March 1st it is no longer Pokemon day but all the party hat pika cheese and party hat eby's please go home please let the other pokemon back in the room we're back to normal time pokemon day is over I had shroomish to come back I was at brunch this morning with my dear friend Greg his husband your wife and Katy and I'm sitting there because we had a 25 wait for brunch cuz welcome to Minnesota and I couldn't catch any more Pokemon in Pokemon go because my box was full because let's not rant about how I pay for a service I can't put the Pokemon in - that's for a later time and I've literally standing there next to Greg and I have literally 400 Pikachu in different hats work I don't have five years of my life to get rid of hat Pikachu's I'd rather delete the app and start I don't pay attention when I catch my little ball Plus does all the caching for me I mean what's going on I just put oh boy oh boy that passive Pokemon go life that's that's the Willie Anderson wait look dudes Pokemon days over party's over go home but since then I think next year I think they leave tomorrow morning by the time this podcast comes up this should be mostly gone everywhere Greg you're also here I am also here it is good that we recording later because at said brunch I had a sugar bomb for breakfast it was beautiful into me it was beautiful and amazing and then I promptly sugar crashed for an hour and a half at 2:00 she's where I was like I'm just sit down like I'm just gonna sit here and pet my dog and then I went I went straight to the gym and lifted for like an hour and a half I was amazing was Greg's dish it came to the table and it was still moving deflated in on it so it's a glorious I loved that dish but man I forget how sugary it is all right well we got sugary show for you guys got a lot of got a lot to get through as Pokemon day I just got I literally got off the plane from pax a couple hours ago I am very tired chanting I did not want to put Greg and will in charge of the episode after Pokemon Day do you your most popular shows witness just the two of us that's probably that's your right here that's probably accurate that's like you know you know saying I'm not coming for Christmas I gotta be here for Pokemon Day news recently because because I was thinking of all the haters and do you remember Greg there's an episode that you and I did together I think was it Bobby that we had or yeah and we went through the map of Galler like it was like our treasure trove of joy and yeah yeah anticipation as well I was on my honeymoon yeah so all y'all haters go back to episode whatever that was and you'll understand what life is laughter before we get in to our show speaking of you know older episodes newer episodes we are very very close to episode 400 it's around the corner isn't this what 398 yes yes so it's about two weeks away so we're gonna do two things one thing is we will be doing a bunch of listener I don't want to say email cuz I'm not telling people to email in but this podcast has been going up on YouTube so that will be one way if you want to ask a question or hang out you can just ask in the comments below on YouTube what your question is Pokemon or non Pokemon related obviously we probably won't be able to get to every question on our 400th episode and then another way is going to be through Reddit when the episode goes up you if you go to our sub subreddit which is our slash super-effective you'll be able to leave a question there and then next week we will have a Google Voice number set up so if and the reason we're not doing it this week is because people are super forgetful and they when I say there's only a week left to do it there's more they're more likely to do it so the Google Voice if you want to leave a voicemail that will go up next week episode will tell you what the number is and stuff so you have a bunch of different ways obviously if you're in slack will have a will have questions there so episode 400 is going to be very question community-focused from you guys questions about Galler or older pokemon games or whether what makes a chair a chair so you can no denied ass ask away for that and we got a loaded show so we have the top 10 Pokemon we have the new mythical that was revealed we had a Mewtwo event and sword and shield we have the most packed month in Pokemon go if you thought February was packed strap on in for March and we got some new Pokemon Center stuff so we're gonna try to get through all of that and masters oh yeah a master sorry I do have the masters tab up I do have that up let's jump into things let's let's actually start with the Mewtwo stuff let's start there the MU the movie came out on Netflix on I'm Thursday Pokemon day I have not seen it yet because I've been traveling all weekend so I know Irene and I will be doing a patreon exclusive anime episode for the me to movie probably not you know this week but probably next week just because I set aside two hours to watch that I can't I forgot this movies like a hundred and like it's like an hour and forty minutes long it's a very it's longer than it should be but maybe I'm misremembering it I remember Minnie it's not even that long it's slightly over an hour and a half that's like three episodes of the end but there's like at least 30 minutes of that you can cut well there's 30 minutes of everything you can cut there's 30 minutes of this show we could always come in we do the parts where Steve is talking yeah but that came out and then armored meets you came back to raids in Pokemon go and they decided to put Dynomax forms of Mewtwo Bulbasaur Ivysaur Charmander Charmeleon squirtle and Wartortle in pokemon sword and pokemon shield max raid battles and this all this will definitely be over by the time his podcasts up when it goes up but it was from February 26 in the evening and then it ended March 1st and they appeared all throughout the wild area I think each of these Pokemon had like a 10% chance to spawn they finally did something to in a main series video game on Pokemon Day there was that one weird Pokemon day where they gave us hidden ability starters like two weeks after Pokemon day through Pokemon Bay yes which I still probably assumed that those were meant for Pokemon Day but probably had technical issues we didn't get just a downloadable Pokemon which I still think is something they kind of should do but this was cool this was like III would probably argue this was one of the better Pokemon days content wise across their multiple platforms that the Pokemon company likes to dominate did you guys Mewtwo I did my word we certainly did although I still don't think I've ever defeated a special focused one although I have defeated I defeated me to four times and I have lost track of which ones I fought but I I want to say for sure three of them were the physical attacker how can you tell the difference whether it used earthquake or seismic sigh strike or blizzard I think a blizzard would have been the special yeah because I had the night that you and I tried to do it it was like blizzard hail blizzard yeah do whatever that was one the special one was definitely harder and I think the special one starts with shields yeah at least all the special ones that I ran and she started with shields and all the physical ones didn't so trying to think about that I think I did defeat one special one but as rough well I have yeah I have a level 100 sent to scorch and I think I have a level 100 grim snarl now trying to that dude with no luck if you missed if you missed the Mewtwo stuff you couldn't catch it so I think some people were really bummed about that although because of how hard it was I feel like they could have made a catchable cuz I don't think you could have just grind it out no you afternoon cuz even if you have a strategy there's still there's still definitely some RNG to it of like oh well I guess meat you just decided to use all four moves on one person right and there's no way no matter how many shields and whatever you're gonna be able to survive just for attack straight I say though much like most MMOs like the first day everybody has no idea what to do in the dungeon yesterday last night when I went in there like literally went in and picked one up and the ones to use on me to everybody brought one like nobody hit okay until they saw what everybody had selected and they wouldn't change like by the end of the weekend everybody knew what the strat was yeah even with random people so it's sort of interesting how rady that really felt like how compared to final fantasy 14 because by the fans 14 also had a patch and that first day of doing those dungeons when nobody knew anything was a nightmare and then three days later you're just flying through it and that's how I felt this was that first day was exciting and hard and frustrating but last night I'm like oh I'll just throw went up and literally everybody knows what to bring and they all brought the right ones and we cleared it no problem I think it was like frustrating in a good way frustrating in a way of like failing a dungeon or a boss and Final Fantasy 14 and being like don't worry we'll just do it again we're getting better every time right we're figuring out what it does and how to tell which is which and what does like should I throw up a light screen show throw up or reflect like lights we didn't reflect were absolutely necessary yeah this is how you can tell I don't play mmo's because I was just wow I was in the woods on Wednesday night and by Thursday I was over it so mmm I could live without the new - so like a 5 star raid in sword and shield those Pokemon are usually around level 60 and then if it was a G max Pokemon like G max toxicity for example that the 5 star that would be closer to a level 70 this Mewtwo was level 100 and it definitely did punish you if you brought a weaker Pokemon yep absolutely it has extremely good type coverage so it could handle super effective hit quite a few different Pokemon and there were Pokemon that definitely stood out that were quickly realized that were better than other Pokemon to use surprisingly eternity eternity za Shion and zama Zenta at least for the dozens of Mewtwo's I did where were not one of the like the top ones to pick they weren't I had I had good success with Drago Pulte if I didn't bring my crimson arrow oh I never I had really good success with go Lysa pod because Mewtwo didn't hit weakness ongal isopods at all and i'd and it was also so I ran glice a pod with assault vest hmm oh that would have been useful yeah I'm helped a lot held items helped a lot especially if you never if you weren't a Pokemon that like set up support items or healed a saw Fest was a really good one especially against the the especially a special attacking me to and dragon pot was so fast that I could get a dark move off and I could also do phantom force which it means I would disappear for a round which helped mitigate damage while coming back and being able to super effective damage so there's a couple of things like planning that out worked really well but I will say during what was harder to use than the others I usually just brought grim snarl because I had T wave both screens and then the one dark pipe move and it was prankster so so here's a question do moves like faint that get past protect and stuff like that I think faint is the one that gets past protect I think phantom force also gets past protect do they get past the shields or no no they they do what also perfective moves do they'll knock down one shield and sometimes damage behind the shield I was doing damage like breaking shield and doing some damage as well but not not the same as it was by passing no hmm I thought the reward items were great I thought it was worth the trouble doing it in my opinion you could get rare candy large candy usually that came in like 10 to 20 extra large candy which again came in 10 to 20 bottle caps and then some other items but the important thing that I mean some people might care about was ability capsules yeah I was surprised I didn't think I was gonna get ability capsules like it wasn't aware that was a gift I'm like I got one I'm like oh sweet yeah not all Mewtwo's dropped ability capsules I think I ended up beating like a closer to 15 Mewtwo's and I walked away with 8 or 9 ability capsules and if you do the math on that real quick that's you know 400 to 450 battle points those ability capsules would have equaled yeah and so that to me I liked once like it took me 3 hours to beat my first me too and it was you know I was rating with people in I'm twitch channel and some were getting frustrated and dropping out some people were like hey I'm gonna need some time to you know pick a Pokemon level it up I'm gonna like sit back and watch so it was like rotating through people and understanding what worked what didn't work I'm figuring out oh there's different Mewtwo's and they know these moves are this moves but once you've got it down and once you had a competent team it would only take like one or two tries to get through Mewtwo if everyone knew what they were doing unless you got the bad luck of like you to just single targeting you know when one pitch happened and things that was hard to do that was hard to get around but you had no choice like you didn't know it was like one one of mine it did brick break to break all the shields and then hit me with three moves and I'm like well that was fun yeah it doesn't really matter how bulky you are usually what it killed you I thought it was great though I thought it was fantastic I want to see more of this and I think the difficulty to reward ratio was perfect I think the standout Pokemon in all of the raids which reminded me of a very big destiny thing will would know exactly what I'm talking about in crotas end which is a raid in the first destiny game people would people would only invite you if you told them you had Gjallarhorn Yallah horn so like if you were trying to get into a crota's end raid and you were like hey I got Gjallarhorn people would be like oh you're in that's what we want we want as many gala horns as possible and in Mewtwo I felt like if you had a marsh shadow you were in you were in like we we need were looking for one marshal you and you only need one marsh shadow two would have been not great in my opinion but if you had that one marsh shadow you were in like oh we got we got aggro everyone had a grim snarl everyone had like a Lapras I thought Jellison twas doing pretty good but it was always like who has more shadow who is the mark we need one I looking for one Marsha uh I think it was Sam who we were raiding with who got his like he invested to get his jealous end up and that thing still got destroyed yeah was good bulky I did it without Marsh shadow stop subbing in drag a pulse uh with understanding that a person brought in something with taunt cuz taunt yeah stop the sad increases that Marsh had it was stealing so there were a couple ways around it but having Marsha that was definitely easier which is I'm still a little weird about that so for those that don't know Marsha Marsha shadow actually had the easiest strat you just came in and you did one single move and it's March shadow signature move which is called spectral thief and usually um so this is what I was a little bit confused about why marsh shadows worked and no one else's did like let's say you had a G max Lapras and G Max is G max Lapras is G max move signature move is is like G max resistance or something but what it does is it does ice damage and then it sets up both light screen and reflect but if you did that G max move when you two had shields up it would not do the secondary effect same like if you two have shields up you can't paralyze it you can't put it to sleep you can't taunt it when a Heche shields up well that's like if you use a Dynomax move and the Pokemon has shields up you don't ever get the field effect right which is the secondary effect but Mar shadows secondary effect worked with shields up which was kind of weird yeah and what it did for those that don't know so like if Mewtwo did nastyplot which would increase its special attack by two and then it did nastyplot again so now it's plus for a special attack when marsh shadow connects and does its move it steals all the buffs that Mewtwo would have so it would steal the Plus for some you too would be back down to normal zero but then Mar shadow would have the +4 and then do its attack afterwards and maybe that's why it gets through because it does this the first thing first and then it does the damage but it's a signature move of marsh Chado so if Mewtwo was you know plus two special defense plus two special attack marsh shadow would steal that for itself which is very beneficial to the entire team because once Mewtwo had a plus two or plus four it was getting almost the point where which one shot anything suspicion is it's because it wasn't a Dynomax move and it's only the Dynomax moves that don't get their secondary effects possibly possibly also I just feel like maybe they just said you know it if you happen to have a Martian oh just let it like just let it work you know I think there's a lot of what there's a lot of signature moves that are brand-new that weren't included when they did the base game that they're just like you know what it's fine now that any people have it and sure just let it happen but I'm not gonna go in and fix it not for a one-off rate event just Mewtwo makes me excited for the raids in the DLC yeah I think if you're going to make something difficult and we know that some Pokemon fans have been asking for difficulty for years and you know if you're gonna make a trainer fail and make it like let me back up scratch all that when they showed max rates for the first time I was hoping it would be like what Mewtwo was I was hoping that every person brought a Pokemon because that Pokemon mattered to that fight and not well every single three-star well with the exception of some five stars every three star and four star raid is just people flexing their shinies and you know and it can be and that's fine like those those are not banned those are not flexor shinies when it's appropriate for that rate thank you very much like me like for example I like when when Mewtwo was relatively new we were like two hours in mu2 I've already failed it three times and then somebody somebody wanted to join the raid and they joined with a level 100 shiny synaesthesia didn't ask any questions they just were like Oh Steve has an open spot I'm joining I want to flex and I was like like I like it's rude to say but I was like oh we instantly lost like we cannot win now because you locked in the sinister and they were like well it's level 100 and I was like look we I've been no measure I was doing this for like an hour and a half I get you just got here but and then they were upset at the end of it that it was too hard it was like well I don't know what to tell you like you brought the wrong Pokemon but yeah but there was never that expectation before right because you could beat a GMAX you know level 70 toxicity with a you know level 100 synergy trust I've got about eight extra sins if anybody wants one I have a lot so anyways I just it really really hit that like Final Fantasy definitely in that feeling strong MMO feel and I can't wait for MMO dungeons to happen in the second gonna be a disappointment get one hallway Greg Noel either saving the MMO dungeons for pokemon mystery dungeon which is coming out this Friday II I was reading it though I was remembering for the first time remember how excited we were when they showed the place where the ultra ultra recon squad headquarters and at the top was when you like fight alternate Kosma but when you get there it's it's not even a hallway so it's like an open square and then you can't do anything but go up an elevator that's my expectations are that for the coop dungeons that you go into for the dens like oh it's just a hallway and then when you get to be I mean it could be a winding hallway like ultra wormholes were as long as there's an out of the cave thing in X&Y anything an accident way like you're walking like you kind of have that crash bandicoot and then you're like turning it like that was not CI I'm gladly try it but it wasn't fun I mean I don't know how they're gonna do that with what if your co-op with four people yeah I don't you know I don't know I just I was really happy to do yeah the other cool thing that they did was the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur had a chance of dropping toxic orb the Charmeleon a Charmander had a drop chance of dropping flame orb and the squirt on the Wartortle had a chance of dropping life orb blame orb very sought-after people were trading a master ball for a flame war because those people cared about competitive they didn't care about you know saving their basketball for some shiny or anything which is understandable and I think that was always a fair trade although the fact that flame herb was all already ridiculous to get in the first place was kind of weird because they knew how that item is very valuable to competitive but again I think that is a good reward forces like the rewards were so good that if you haven't played in a month I felt like this was the thing to come back to you might not care about toxicity maybe didn't care about mill story but if you were if you were missing key items if you were wanting to get hidden ability starter Pokemon if you wanted I did and if you wanted to try to challenge me to I thought I thought this was the best like four days that they did raid wise yeah it was pretty fun yeah I wish I had known about the starter Pokemon because I actually when I got up this morning I saw that Micah was doing raids and I saw that he was doing like Bulbasaur and all that biz I couldn't get in on him cuz they filled up too fast and I was like oh that's interesting they're doing the starters and I didn't realize that they were really good starters yeah well you don't always get the hidden ability once again it's hit or miss but yeah and it should get all the hidden ability once and I managed to get each starter in a luxury ball so I can breed them in luxury balls and I'm very happy about that speaking of luxury though part of the whole Pokemon day thing was the Pokemon Center would be getting some new stuff and it's just a lot of wallets ties tie bars okay that was a little little disappointed oh it's also just winning of the bow ties the bow ties the bow ties are not real bow ties oh really the Crito they're very tiny clips which is like you give us look they know their actual tight eyes it's not that one of the what one of them could be an actual bowtie just one it's not that hard I did it for what seven people at your wedding Pokemon Center little disappointing not too much stuff I don't want to paid 13 bucks for a pair of socks they're cute socks though yeah or they buy me Sh no they're whatever now brand the poke I don't think their socks are the best quality for 13 bucks yeah I mean there's a bunch of more ditto stuff but that was added kinda last week did um you I wonder if they had more planned I was actually expecting like more Galler plushies but nope well they did have free shipping so yeah well it's yeah but they always have 50 yeah that was that was a thing that's true they had free shipping on Pokemon Day but they always have free shipping or $50 or more and it's really easy to get to 50 bucks they have the weird sleeping intellect slide pin nothing's gonna break in two minutes sleeping deluxe slide pen yeah those rates don't you sleeping it's good luck sliding celebrations Pokemon pin which will break in about a minute yeah maybe not maybe you know well it's $10 I'm not a huge pin person slide that Pikachu into Meowth and snap it right off let's take a break we got all the sword and shield stuff out of the way so we got mythical we got masters we got go and we

Cigna suit Eliza and Rotom and battle Villa debut during the six-month celebration anniversary of Pokemon masters full disclosure partnered with DNA both disclosure I am NOT neither am i red is finally here yep with Charizard and scandal red speaks what does well for me wait all I've seen is dot dot mm-hmm oh no you have way behind it you have to find it for those that don't play Pokemon masters Greg what does Cygnus suit mean because they say suit red and Cygnus suit Eliza I do play Pokemon masters and I don't know what a Cygnus suit is and it's spelled sy g na yes I don't know I don't know what Sigma I don't know if that's supposed to mean something but anyways so they have their regular in-game outfits and then they have their Pokemon masters outfit which is called Cygnus suit and if they explained why they pick Cygnus it's somewhere I missed it but like at some point Brock changes outfits and he's I'm in my Cygnus suit this is my souped-up super powered outfit I'm more angry or excited or whatever in this outfit so it's basically their shorthand for not Holliday tied alternate clothing I'll put my comm real quick the hero of Pokemon Red and Blue is joining the playable cast of put my masters alongside his iconic partner Charizard the sync pair is just as powerful as you expect Charizard will mega evolve into mega Charizard X Plus Cygnus suit red and Charizard sync grid is already expanded so be sure to earn some orbs to make them more powerful you will be able to scout which is pull Cygnus suit red and Charizard for a limited time during the poky fair scout available March until March 15 so we have plenty of time we Greg and I were just talking during the break Steven stone is also available to the 16th so if you haven't pulled Steven yet or you want to pull Steven you got plenty of time still and then they introduced the battle Villa which is a single-player gauntlet feature that allows many different sync pairs of shine each battle Villa challenge period lasts for two weeks each day you'll be able to create a team of nine sync pairs and see how far you can progress each battle will still be on the three-on-three format but HP MP and status conditions carry over for each battle oh that actually sounds cool yeah it's it's fun and surprisingly hard it's it's um this might be the first time Greg you said this is fun yeah it's so it's actually like a it's actually a puzzle you sort of have to look ahead and decide who am i bringing to her to get through the gauntlet when should I heal [ __ ] like at low levels is even use using my moves cuz you run out of PP like your speed ups your stat boosts if you use one of them they're gone so like if you blow it on the first run-through like I did you don't have them and the second one unless you spend items to get them back and those items don't come readily so the gameplay inside isn't that exciting is it still the same 3x3 battle but that extra sort of thought process is money and I get is actually it makes doing those battles a bit more exciting than I'm just gonna have to bowl this over because you do bowl over the lower levels but you still have to think about what you're doing because of the higher levels yet to come also if you are able you will earn lots of competition roars in the battle villa including a special items such as lucky cookies and lucky squirrels you can use these reward to give your sink pairs new compatibilities capabilities known as lucky skills at the end of the challenge period you will receive rewards corresponding to the number of battles you've cleared so try to get as far as you can they also added Valerie and sylveon which we talked about last week so you can now go up to chapter 24 Valerie isn't a pole Valerie is just reward you get for completing that chapter so please get up there for star I think I think she's three star okay because like that you get second fairy besides Greenville yep there is a sigma suit Eliza and Rotom which will be available like the same as red and Steven they can use X special attack to everyone they will also come with an expanded sync red like red and Charizard you can now evolve a bunch of Pokemon including Calum and s / Albert and Oshawa Blaine and the famous Blaine ponyta not what I think of when I think of Blaine but okay I just think of rapper - though so this makes a little bit more cash sure sure I think in pokemon stadium he had a rapid - but I feel like the TV show really hit home with that magmar yeah I mean okay hang you got that right everybody that you couldn't basically you couldn't evolve before you can now so my desk what's the middle one dusclops my desk ops is now finally a dusknoir that's not yeah yeah it was the very first one I did because I'm like I all the time I'm gonna need the ball so the shining star event a license Rotom her her solo challenge is also very interesting it's a whole map system so you move through things to get different rewards and you have to get up move tokens to be able to move through the maze again the gameplay in the actual game it's the same old gameplay but there's at least an extra element of okay I'm gonna think about how I want to move through this maze and what I want to pick up and do I want to use all of my moves on this one or do I just want to get to the end to get to the next thing that might have better rewards it's actually this I think this is the first time that they've really branched out to try a lot of very different things I think the battle Villa and Eliza's event are both very positive signs that they are willing to look at other games other things that work really well and figure out an intelligent way to work it into this system I still think there's too much low-level grinding but this is more of what I want from and game content like interesting challenges things that I that I want that are unique from each other like when this event goes away hopefully something better will replace it but that's different I think the problem with like the stephen stohn event and the mutual vent and the requires event is that the progression was exactly the same you went through a story and then you did the exact same co-op these feel very different and that makes the game a lot more exciting for the first time this weekend I'm like ooh I kind of want to jump into masters and says run through some of the new interesting stuff and I have not said that about this game until these hit so I think this is a very positive turning point for masters and I really hope that they continue experimenting this way and really trying a bunch of new ways to interact with their base gameplay now that we've seen the journey of Greg slowly start to change hey hey I caught Barry you catch him right yeah I caught a Barry you got it Barry yeah excuse me you owe me at million dollars yeah I did I caught him on the beach cuz he thought I was part of team break oh right yeah nicholae I'm not in my sync group which also is weird to me but okay but to commemorate Pokemon Day and poke my masters you will receive a one-time gift of 3000 gems which is 10 character poles if you log into the game at any time between March 15th you can also get the six month celebration login bonus which will give you another 3,000 gems by logging in for 14 times in the 14 day period but because it's now it's a March 15 so you could like miss like four days and still be fine if you want to know how much 3000 gems in is in money it's about 25 bucks so just by logging in and collecting your Pokemon Day bonus you're getting what would I guess technically be $25 worth of in-game cursed currency to pull I mean in reality it's the dollars because you can't put a value on did mom man it's not like you there's a marketplace to like sell your expert even stones did you also see that you can now favor it your sink pairs so they show up in your Lobby more oh what really yeah good I think there's Lobby yep wait so okay now let me just see if I can put this into terms I can understand I start up the game my ears explode because of the brass horns and then somebody is standing there yelling at me because I'm not playing enough so I can basically pick the person who's gonna yell at me for not playing enough yes like right now right is the one that quote-unquote yells at me which is just a whole bunch of dots and that is my ideal what greeting hey now I got a pole red wait where do you where do you go to like set them going to edit team okay pick on pick on who everyone and then next to them when they show up at the top you'll see a little plus oh I see and then there's a heart up in the heart and they will show up more often so gardenia and rosary show up or often and red shows up more often for me all right anything else sorry I want you want you probably want wolf regret Oh No Phoebe definitely Phoebe should show up more often you see be a lot I'm gonna tell Steven stone to visit but it's it's it's a nice yes it's like a little thing that I discovered I'm like oh that makes me feel more connected to this game like I the people that I like using even though I don't use them a lot in game I could at least interact with them and they'll give me things more often they'll show up more often and that's a fun little change it makes me more willing to log in instead of I'll get like Wulfric sitting over there yelling at me I'm like I don't want you here go away I'm Bruno telling the trade and harder every time you log yet no you can go now thanks Bruno that was a cute little change that I just covered like yay let's talk about this mythical Marines here boy oh boy Zara the rogue monkey Pokemon has been discovered we have confirmed the existence of a new mythical Pokemon a dark and grass type Pokemon with a clever mastery of vines incredible news trainers this is off pokemon.com by the way we can confirm the new medical pokemon has been discovered as rude at the road rogue monkey is a dark and grass type Pokemon that cannot be found in normal gameplay of Pokemon sword and shield this mythical Pokemon stands the average of 511 weighs 154 pounds and has the ability leaf guard zerud can grow vines from its back of its neck and its wrists and the soles of its feet at will these vines are strong and flexible and they can be used for a variety of purposes za Roode will use the vines to wrap around trees and branches to move around or grab berries from distant branches these vines have healing properties if is a rude wraps its vines around a wound it will the wound will heal well that I'm sure that's a plot point in the movie thanks Pokemon did you watch the trailer I did it has been reported that the rude lives in a pack deep in the heart of a dense forest it treats anyone that isn't part of its pack with immediate hostility attacking right away because of this other Pokemon that live in the same forest are afraid of zoo rude when fighting the rude swings around tree branches attacking relentlessly with sharp claws or other means it has its quick wit will help it excel in battles and that is all the information we have on Giroud and they show him no moving in the game and they have a movie trailer which only came out in Japan not for us but I took him on the movie Coco okay yeah there's a couple of things that like so can we talk are we spoiler alert spoiler alert of hands in this Chandler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler trailer is that a thing yeah just because it starts with a shiny Celebi it does yeah and so all I can think of is okay so this mythical is strong against psychic and so it's strong against Celebi like I'm like that has to be at least somewhat of a major plot point in the movie right like well if you so I okay so before we talk about the like there's a point I want to bring up in the trailer okay when I saw the rude I was like oh it looks like a Pokemon like I get it it doesn't scream like ultra beast or anything ah but I didn't love it and I don't know how you guys write about it I was fine with it it screams that sort of dark edgy Wolverine hero type thing which I don't really like that was so popular in the 90s what I got from it so I thought it was an interesting design but is it's not it's got that sort of Hot Topic II feel that I'm not a huge fan of yeah I guess you could say genesect maybe has that feel or Darkrai maybe has that feel like it's not it's not an unusual mythical there's like always two times of mythical there's like you're edgier where I haz has a very strong theme right dark right is a shadow it really fits that theme and it's hard to say what this theme is it's like as definitely well Oh Tarzan it's Tarzan British yeah UK noble that raised in the jungle I mean that's what the whole height what the pre-code movie is I want my menticles to be cute period I don't well I don't want these grumpy mythical z' no no I want cuties I want I want victini's I want Muse the ANC's little hoopa's McGee Rinna's Mar shadows I want to give them hugs I wanna Shaymin I'll take the regular Shaymin keldeo even I don't want these grouchy mythical z' yeah but that mask is gonna be real popular Halloween at butterfly face no yeah Oh bang yeah I wasn't I wasn't too hot on it and I eat I mean I was I also was it too hot on Zahra Ora once again not a cutie but I I'm a huge fan of Darkrai and I really liked genesect a lot you oh you like dark ride because of the movie Dada exactly I'm sick like I mean after episode 400 you're not allowed to say that anymore i watch you you were right in the fact that movies have definitely influenced my opinion on Pokemon because I thought volcania and was really cool until I saw that movie and I was like you know what punk volcano's not your friend no more the trailer which you can search for official trailer movie Pokemon movie 23 Coco so is rude a color that we don't know like that magenta right yes this is rude is rude like green is there a green color that's rude because it does fit like it wasn't a surprise that it was grass because that's they did the they did the three colors the primary colors red blue and now green that made total sense I going in knew it was gonna be grass I was just confused by the name I mean I think they're just saying he's a rude boy is that it like just know about the color scheme Zaa is something in japanese that eventually equals monkey like I think it's a monkey I think it's like Saru is is what the like za is I guess we would have to ask Andrew but I'm only yeah I only get the rude part of its name I've seen people say that it has a lot of characteristics and I kind of agree with them with specifically GRU key and thwack II yes I mean this is we've had this conversation a million times there's plenty of Pokemon that look like other Pokemon uh-huh ruphylin and tauros miltank and tauros Luvdisc and that bad bigger fish mo mo mo mo mo mo mo that one yes like in the in the lore of Pokemon that that doesn't ever surprise me when a Pokemon looks slightly like another Pokemon I wonder if there could be two other mythical z' I'd be really interested if one was a rabbit and the other one was a lizard and you're a visionary well sob sob will not a lizard oh wow kinda yeah most because not only is za rude another monkey and we have a lot of monkey Pokemon there's a lot of monkeys in the in the world yeah but will that accept this there's no no I'm not complaining over a billion we got a starter monkey that was grass and now we have a mythical monkey that is grass and I'm here and we know that there's at least one more mythical and we know that there might be another mythical that might be like the cute mythical the like the Celebi or the MU or the drive the cute mythical I need it I mean this is cute in its only yeah so I am I warmed up to the rude more when I saw the trailer okay so this is the fan in the trailer that's that's kind of important ah it's an easy sell for me you put a cape on any Pokemon I'm buying in okay but you don't like superheroes I don't but like a Pokemon wearing a cape is is very adorable I don't it's like when Pikachu puts a hat on or like when Pikachu's holding a ketchup bottle there's like something about hey hey hey don't bring in the ketchup bottle like whoa no no movies capes none but there's like something about I don't know like a Pokemon wearing something that I meant you look the reason that literally the reason that licky licky is so good in the Darr crime movie is it because it had that dumb sash across it because it's that one deer that turns into the lake you lucky didn't have the sash he has the sash so okay so okay whatever the girl if you watch the trailer as the rude is wearing a cape which I think does add more personality to it specifically of the Kapus pink and specifically the Cape has the numbers 251 on it which is not only Celebes number but that's the same pink that shiny Celebi is yeah also Mojo Jojo from Power Puff Girls wears a similar cape so make your own judgement there's a whole power there's a whole Powerpuff Girls thing like you look it up on the Internet it's kind of funny look at that there's a crane rant in this movie so I'm soldiers and yeah I saw that at the end of the trailer as Pikachu and at the end of the trailer is that rude is sitting in the hot spring and that is also very cute because that's what the monkeys in Japan do I saw it on TV I played mom I did know they come down from the mountain the monkeys in Japan they come down and they sit in the hot spring and then you can go to the park and visit them and they're protected it's real cute for me the movie trailer made me warm up to zerud a lot more than just the the initial screenshot I can't say that the shiny Celebi or the root itself has made me excited for that movie but you put a cream ran in I'm sold I'm also not huge on tart like I never liked Tarzan as kid I don't really like that yeah well there's no I mean there's very Maddox is a classic story it is a problematic story just say the least but it is a classic it's a necessary the other thing is like we already had this with the Kangaskhan kid so I'm not like thrilled that we're revisiting that again how does Tarzan and girl comes finds Tarzan they get married here Jane thank you okay it depends on which version you're what like the standard one he returns and is civilized back into society somewhat it's yeah there's a danger of somebody trying to capture the root and ask you know they're destroying the forest didn't you notice the trees were falling down did you pay attention to this trailer at all no no well yeah I did there's a crane ran in it I'm in I'm already sold I just like sooner like that I'm excited for the movie but the general theme of the movie just seems very not exciting yeah but you know hey it's gonna be awesome hopefully in the power we had the power of us and I choose you so it nowhere to go but up well hmm yike yeah I would put I choose ease significantly higher than the Vulcanian movie yeah but that's not been the best huh that's a a while ago I've known about the last two films yeah it looks like it's just a chigan and partners but okay does this mean the team rocket has Cameron is that what we're getting here I'm they it looks like they're stealing or trying to steal cram rant and the Kramer and it looks so dumb that it doesn't know what's happening which that's me yeah like your shines kiss moment right there yes I'm worried that the crime rate jokes are given the same as SciTech jokes no no no no no no if Kramer ant should be the munchlax of this movie cuz munchlax was the best part of Destiny d-axis because it was like munchlax head the through line and it was its own like good story going through isn't that much less on the doughnut machine of the hot dog machine yeah yeah yeah like trash cans it's great Wow it's it's real good as long as cram rant is gargling Pikachu I'm there yeah I mean if we walk away from this movie with with a bad story of Tarzan but good crime rant moments that will be better than 90% of Pokemon movies geez Steve you're such a kid okay so before we get into Pokemon of the year sounds like Maddie is back and she is on the move so let's let's see what Maddie is up to [Music] hi guys welcome to the next episode of Maddie on the move it is February 22nd it's another community day it's nice and beautiful and sunny in Minneapolis and I just got to the Mall of America looks like it's gonna be a little busy inside I had to park all the way up on the sixth level so here's hoping there's gonna be a lot of people playing Pokemon go all right let's get inside [Music] word on the street is that will from the podcast is here so I'm on my way over to find him but literally this place is insane today okay you guys I made it I found well we're right by Moose Mountain and this place is little crazy well what do you think today is gonna be like well exceptionally crowded the parking was impossible and I think I've already gotten three shiny right horns already so I'm done for the day that's amazing okay we're gonna go down to Nickelodeon Universe and see if we can scare some strangers okay I'm here found a family with Matt cheese shirt you guys do Community Day a lot yes what's your favorite part about community day for showing these with the ground kids Oh fine how long have you been doing this I've done it twice but I don't the JDRF walk we've done for ten years and then we just stay to play so you get to come here for a cause and then just spend the day together yep that's so awesome how many Chinese have you caught today three three how about you - nice nice yes I've got nine about you every three buckets up the most all the time we have a contest Maddi here with two more people playing pokemon go what's your name my name is Julia Julia and I'm Alexia Lexi so what is your favorite part about today's community day Chinese Chinese yeah so how many right hands have you guys caught hundred what do you do with hundreds of China your ayah horns tournament candy yes well I see you wearing a growl a shirt correct orgonite a while we're gonna say that I was right because people can't see a podcast so does that mean that you play pokemon outside of pokemon go man what's your favorite probably emerald emerald helped me like emerald the best I know battle frontier yeah that's pretty solid do you play any other polka definitely I would have to say emerald sapphire ruby also because they were the first game that I ever played to see ya it's really surprising walking around a lot of people just play pokemon go and have like no other experience with pokemon but just fine but I mean I love to work on my goal because I've been playing pokemon forever exactly just like I needed in the real world exactly one like you get the pet like my buddy and I had meows and he was sitting in my living or like next to my cat I was like this is incredible amazing who did you guys pick as your buddy I'm more than training I'm brown right now nice I have luxray because it's one of my favorite Pokemon okay we've been here for like an hour so we're walking past the old time photos will should we get some old-time photos sometime are you saying that I'm old is that what you're trying to imply I mean I say if you're wearing an old western uniform you're not gonna look bad in it I would look so cute that I might think we do need to get back to rags sock though because we need to get those holographic green cards yeah watch out for the next cover of the episode it's going to be me and wealth matching see-through raincoats all right I found a couple of people here by moose mountain playin poker my girl what are your names I'm Colin Colin Susan what's your favorite part about playing Pokemon to get all this shiny and during this event so far I've got ten Chinese China is it all right horn yep what are you gonna do with them I'm gonna trade some of their friends and I'm gonna get a Stein you I'm gonna get a shiny ride down and your shiny right here here also that sounds like a really good day do you guys do Community Day a lot we tried to yes so as a mom of two boys obsessed with Pokemon it's nice to come out especially in the cold to the Mall of America cool thanks guys have a good day bye bye [Music] you guys the mall was crazy that was a lot of people playing Pokemon I think we tried to some good ones I think we got some good stuff will and I had a lot of fun walking around looking at crazy stuff in the Mall of America I didn't catch a single Rhyhorn because I was too busy talking to people but that's okay because that's what Maddie in the move is about all right we'll see you guys next time bye [Music] thanks Maddy Pokemon of the year all right I got a difficult one for you guys Pokemon of the year I made it real tough just kidding how do you how do you want to do this you want to go by region you want to just do top five of top do top five first okay and then we'll talk about how everybody was wrong and how upset that and of course isn't any anywhere on the johto list you all failed me sure there is nothing surprising about this list of me what about you guys I mean I was surprised about nights where I said who'd number one actually was cuz I was sure it was gonna be Charizard oh okay spoiler wasn't charizard charizard alright number five Umbreon like why no I know I don't know now props I think I'm Breanna is a beautiful spelt eeveelution in your opinion no there's a lot more okay everyone who loves Umbria let me let me I'm sorry I'm gonna break down the Umbreon crowd okay cuz I made the Umbreon crowd yeah they were all edge lords and middle school and cool silver came out you you were an edge large in middle school so why are you not an idiot and uh cuz your your choice at the time was you were you were either so committed to Eevee that Umbreon was the natural progression right hey and I'm not disagreeing I'm Briana significantly better than Jolteon flare and Vaporeon or you went the other edge Lord route and you gravitated towards hound hour and hound ooh oh yeah cuz they got skills right and I ended up in the Hound our houndoom camp look I was a very troubled child I can't even say the gen waters came out for us so Charizard number four me me queue number three heck yeah heck yeah I'm here for it number two is the worst number two hurts my soul number two is Lucario know that's why shrieking I I blame that on the Europeans no this is absolutely mmm it is get together Europe it is surprising to me that Lucario got more votes than Charizard I would I would argue that they really struggled with Gen 3 and trying to push a Pokemon that people can gravitate towards like Charizard they didn't really even have one for Jen - you could argue that it was like the eb evolutions i mean i will say that i mean if you look at the votes gen 3 did very well I mean gen 3 is expected is exactly what I expected through 2p I'm sure if you rewound the podcast to 7 weeks ago I think we said like either SBN or Umbreon is breadwinning Johto Kantos when it Charizard when in Kanto and that Rayquaza is going to ruin twin Hoenn and that's what happened well we knew that and then it's not surprising to me that Lucario once in oh that's what I expected yes Gen 5 is like the only thing that like blew me away here I will argue that gen fine gen 5 had the worst showing of all the gens see the problem is all the Jenna 5 Pokemon are so wonderful it's just hard to pick one that stands out above I mean so so much excellent and so that that's sarcasm but I I think there's some truth from Mari Anderson you think any praise of Gen 5 is sarcasm but then how have we been doing this program together for eight years okay Lucario yeah because the card there's a whole wrench and everything the the gen 3 fanbase for what we're very vocal for their remix they won their horn that's them they invert very and they they were very happy and then they instantly shut up whereas we got what we want whereas like the the johto fanboys will never shut up they got a completa you know that that heartgold SoulSilver is their favorite game in the entire universe and blah blah blah - rooster and they book like we like the the johto fans will they'll never shut up no the hoenn fans they they got their game they were happy they learn they love their starters and they love their legendaries it's really the only thing that gen3 has to offer Jen winners have the worst and they never showed up either and then the cinah fans are now at the age where they have become I I would argue as bad as Jen winners we're like you they're there because Senna was their first Pokemon game because Lucario is their Charizard that they think that their region and their game was perfect and Sinnoh is far from perfect but yeah right like somebody like you me know you'll meet a gen winner and they'll say like oh you know Pokemon got bad after 150 the Kanto is the best region most memorable 51 Thank You 151 yeah that now that mindset like exists for people for sin oh and I would expect the same thing if we were to get to know remakes this fanbase will not shut up they will know they will continue on so as much as I don't me are getting those remakes you know we're getting me yeah sure I mean they love money it'd be silly not yeah absolutely they love money if there's one thing about the gen 3 fans not my favorite region but they were very happy with their remade region and they went back to doing their thing we are an easy to please happy group who don't harp on things unlike the rest of all yo we know the perfection of our region we got it we're happy with it if you can't see it that's on you and number one with a bullet greninja I was somewhat surprised I mean I'm not surprised because the anime I guess I really thought that Charizard in Virginia would have been reversed in the sanding I would have probably said greninja was top three yeah and I would have probably said Lucario top five I would have actually put maybe Eevee or Mewtwo at number one because Eevee fanboys are everywhere everywhere Eevee fan people thank you Eevee fan folks I'm the app Mewtwo not being a lot higher as surprising since Mewtwo's is very very dominant in Japan having so much Charizard I don't know Benja no greninja ogre ninja does the thing that appeals to a lot of people they they they combined Pokemon and Naruto together now they just need to what's one piece pirates they just need to find some pirate in two straw hat Pikachu yeah but they gotta apply that to a Pokemon to carry going to success because one piece is very popular I mean they just maybe that's what the root is it's got the gum gum fruit makes its arm stretch I don't know what okay so you said gum gum fruit and I think in retrospect greninja is not surprising because I if you if you were to look at least at the anime series yeah I would argue that people were upset that Ash lost because the relationship between ash and greninja was probably the best relationship they wrote I would agree it's second to like ash and Charizard or I guess like but I mean beside that I should Pikachu that I don't think that that's a fair comparison but and that's probably why sceptile is a lot higher than some other Pokemon is because of Ash's sceptile yeah I mean definitely the anime has changed and definitely influenced where we add all surprised by who wouldn't Galler okay let's let's go through all let's go through top ten for each real quick and I think the first couple are not surprising here so Kanto is coming in at number ten is Lapras nine arcanine 8 mu 2 7 mu 6 Dragon Knight 5 Eevee or Pikachu 3 Bulbasaur to Gengar and 1 Charizard oddly enough when people were complaining about the national dex they ran their reddit pole and Charizard came in number one ironic that the Pokemon company wouldn't want to cut the number one Pokemon from their games and Gengar was also I want to say very very high as well as arcanine very very high on those polls yeah I don't think there's any surprises here with that top 10 I would probably maybe saw Snorlax in the top 10 it shied out here at 11:11 but like literally I don't think there was any any surprises with that list I mean I'm mad that cubone is on the list but whatever ya know mr. mime cubone was robbed okay fo robbed Joe talked about the crime that is Joe - yeah that's farce isn't on this list at all and I'm very mad at everybody I gave you very explicit instructions and none of you followed through you know there's no cool fish on here either well cuz qwilfish is terrible alright number 10 Totodile so we [ __ ] cyndaquil Espeon which I thought was a little low eevee eevee people maybe you know split on this Ampharos scizor Typhlosion lugia Tyranitar Umbreon there's no surprise with that top three at all nope yeah that's very straightforward hoenn a little shocked that absol my top 10 actually oh absolutely popular but I was surprised that it that it I expected my while to be higher because of its you like people use it all the time so I was surprised that that was way down in 18 at least Sableye Maitlis so I'm fine can we tell the weirdest part of this list is Iran at 13 this is mind-blowing to me yeah yeah well Aaron and egg run 13 and 14 yeah like I don't know why that's so weird to me also hold on let's back up not too came in at 18 for Johto excuse me not you ready because they're cute look at your edge lord houndoom was beaten up by look you had slim pickings in Johto I understand but boy I mean Wooper at least made the list okay coming in at number 10 absol Milotic Jirachi Metagross mudkip Blaziken sceptile Flygon Gardevoir and Rayquaza I thought Metagross would have been higher really I did think yeah this would have been higher than Flygon I I agree I would put my two girls over Flygon in what I thought better Gardevoir position doesn't surprise me garter bar is amazing now the same people who voted for Gardevoir voted for Lucario a hundred percent not a doubt in my mind Road I did not I voted for sample I positive moment Lucario ah sin Oh your top ten Giratina Empoleon Arceus Glaceon Darkrai Infernape Piplup luxray Garchomp and then Lucario can we just finally say that Turtwig is the bad starter of Senna yes since the other ones were all the top ten and Turtwig is way down in 21 anyone who voted for lopunny also probably voted for Gardevoir and Lucario I'm just putting that out there love when he came in at 19 Bidoof who I you put Bidoof at 20 and you didn't put Dunsparce anywhere on the little boob is a thousand times better than Dunsparce get a dose of reality is at 20 and rose raids at 26 excuse me the only shocker here for me is ro Tom's not top ten I don't think people like base Rotom though I think they like the forms and the form of didn't happen until what gen-y they happened in four no I don't think it's weird mention most misdreavus and miss Maggie is made top thirty and rid of their respective things which is like slightly weird to me because I feel like no one ever talks about those Pokemon or ever brings those Pokemon I think their wishes and this was a worldwide vote and you keep thinking of like us people I mean like in incredibly unpopular or incredibly popular in China or something well I don't I don't think there were a lot to vote because they don't have Google in China that's not a hundred percent sure if there's ways around that are you sure there is like I do like I if those like a Japanese only list I guarantee you sternal X would have been top five like and if this was an American only list I guarantee you like Snorlax would have been top five like I I do know the difference between like I dunno what's popular in Japan compared to like America and those are probably the two biggest markets voting yeah another just honorable mention here is porygon porygon to ian porygon z all may top 30 in their respective areas wild let's go to Gen 5 which has probably the most interesting Pokemon here listed so number 10 is Russia room number nine Victini number eight zekrom seven Asha wat six superior five Haxorus for volcanion three hi dragon two zark and one Chandeleur that number one is wild aronia Volcarona Volcarona volcanion is a Gen 6 padania yeah yes sorry I always have volcanion on the brain are we also admitting that Tepig and Emboar are bad well they're not bad they just don't necessarily like is epic the only starter that didn't make it yep did you have all starter makers I see a cynic oh I see chikorita Totodile is like super up there isn't he yeah yeah Charmander didn't make top 30 yeah I know he did he's 17 them rent Tepig isn't on the list that's an okay it's okay I know it's an acquired taste a lot of people didn't like Tepig and it's evolutions that's fine I mean it'll love him no shock that Sam rant samraat synonymous list either it's a Moretz 18 oh it didn't make the list yeah did we hear but Emboar and Tepig nah I am super surprised that genesect and genesect and Calvillo or and Kira are solo I did not like I love Chandeleur it's easily one of my favorite Pokemon I did not expect it to come in number one I think I actually voted for it for Gen 5 so your vote swayed the decision right there and I would have spent expected either zoroark or like Keldeo to have won this and kellyo is not even top 10 or Victini I could have seen but there's only so many of us Victini it's a Victini of the list oh yeah because you know I was nine I mean a lot of people like Victini que lo que ellos your top ten are tyrantrum which was unexpected Gumi weird expected yveltal dedenne talonflame goodra noivern he just slash sylveon greninja hi-yah I thought maybe Esper would have been a little bit higher because I felt like Esper was the talk of the town when I came first came out in your house it was heliolisk made top thirty very yeah weird who's like who likes heliolisk a bunch of people I'm happy that del Fox's own mix the sex is probably my favorite drag algae make number two voted for dress [ __ ] me I love dragalge so you can take your attitude back home with you cuz I loved I know you don't like it I like it where I struggle to 23 I think Jay gouge is real cool it was above froakie what the heck yeah froakie got robbed head yeah braixen and delphox are on the lists because of the Lucario and lopunny vote juice I'm just like look there's a common theme between all of these Pokemon they're all standing on two legs fennekin's on the list of their murder his braixen like the only middle evolution that made it Breck should just like a literally elite middle evolution that made it and that's probably because of pokken tournament probably yes probably I mean Pancham is on there but fantastic ut I mean pangoro also made the list right yeah both Pancham and pangoro made list I love cute pokémon a Lola Lola we have so Gallio be where that's all TV show 100% free marina go Lysa pod and also would wager TV show um in cinah roar Zahra hora I who voted for that oh I know the people who voted for blue Cara um like in rock did you I Rowlett and me me Q I mean Rowlett best starter yup but uh so Litton is on the list what was the water starter hip hop Aliyah free marina made at top ten that's pretty good so all the starters ended up on in this list which is just wild that all right and then we go to gala and etc because you can't count all right we'll do all 34 Geller here my boy yeah yeah isn't that all the Galipeau c'mon I said my boy came in number 30 cramp boo 8,000 people right in the world Rilla boom opps the goon ice cue frost moth Draco vez Draco fish is a hundred percent because of VGC yeah it's awesome it's also just a funny-looking it's one of the funnier look it's kind of derpy look yeah sentai scorch which surprising to me mel medals Amazon toe grim snarl GRU key more Peko or more picot eternities is I 18 Appleton 17 phalanx Melton under your gen8 take it for what it's worth it was gen8 and etc that's true this is etc hug bolt is etc Sabo hat serene square bunny sir fetched in tele on Lulu is number 9 ampere za Chien cinder ace I'll cry me snob Korver Knight coming in at number 3 tox tricity number 2 Drago Pulte number 1 yeah there you go I have one thing to say about Ice Cube that you view now reminded me just a quick aside back in the pokemon black and white days I don't remember if they carried this forward for x and y but when you played black and white if you battled every trainer in that game you saw every single Pokemon whether it was in your game or not in your game I realized today that I play through sword you know I talked to every trainer I battle every trainer in the game I never saw ice QE even once is Melanie's Pokemon yeah I mean that's why I'm just saying this like you you don't even get to see it yes I have it as seen in your pokedex in sword yeah I know you did in black and white I don't know if that's like a huge issue for me oh it is because if I wasn't talking to people I wouldn't even know that Pokemon existed gonna be like scratching I didn't go out of discovery you're not one of those people that sit on the route and keep seeing if you caught everything but I could sit there for the rest of my life and never have come across a nice queue it's not in my game oh that's true yeah I don't I've I've only the only time I've seen like two star owners is like somebody hosting a stone journal raid that I joined there's your gallery Pokemon uh isn't where the Korver nights so hi no it's cool all right it's like they finally got Skarmory right yeah Crim's Grimm snarls not actually surprising to me that's a pretty cool pokémon well the Giganta max version the res version the regular version no flap Oh chicken fish flap will didn't make the list but Appleton did I'm mad about that yeah that's just people who like ugly things that's what you guys hating on pie I like pie I don't like Appleton does not surprise me I actually thought sind race is gonna be number one here cinder H a yes and garage I am not surprised that toxicity came in at number two I'm not either you got your hot topics playing its guitar chest and yeah wow smoking cigs in the corner voting on Umbreon and toxicity I'm sure I wanted like that's the thing I'm more interested just happy that snom is for I need the Venn diagram of who's voting for Pokemon we need hey Pokemon company give us give us this bridge yes wait a moria data because you know people was just collecting this data and putting it with all of your purchasing and response and all about share and now they know everything about everything but if they were ever to do this again I mean these these this is why I like this list was not like surprising to an extent because it's almost always the same Pokemon like it's always gonna be Charizard for Kanto it's always gonna be Lucario for sin now Shanna okay all of you Nova is a huge mystery still and I don't know if the people who started with you know of what what age would they be right now like 21 if they were eight in what 2010 yeah they'd be 18 to 20 yeah and they're yeah I don't know where they would be out in life I don't think they know where they're at in life I'm sure that's true but like as much as I was like saying that people who voted for Lucario voted for Gardevoir and for lopunny and for talks not text zero or a like I do strongly believe that that there's a theme between those Pokemon and a specific type of person and there's nothing wrong with it like likes the bipedal two-legged Pokemon anthropomorphic and that doesn't like have like cinder a swath away from the gen8 starters as being the dominant starter I mean you could even make that same argument for greninja of like it is more anthropomorphic yeah open more FAQ but all of the starters in gen in the current 10 went that route yeah went that route yeah like I mean are you just saying saying people only vote of them because they walk on two legs no is that your main point yes possibly awesome that's why I mean I think like definitely Lucario had a huge push like it had its own movie like I think all the ones that are on the top had huge pushes yeah with the exception of Chandler yeah but you know it was weird like Zoroark came in second but I think but we can't say the Chandler didn't because Chandler was a huge part of pokken tournament now that's like that's true there were big pushes for the ones that are at the top there are big media presences for all of these and so like I think one of the big things that they're proving is their media works really well when they push something media wise it really does lodge into people and make them like it a lot more yeah I mean I would say Zurich failed they literally copied a case well no I mean in in marketing I would argue that it seemed like it failed compared to help Ariel I think hockey and pay for carriers you put that I think that's your opinion I disagree with that so much I think Zurich is not the new locario but they did the same thing between Zoroark and look like they took everything they did with Lucario and they applied it to Zurich they gave it their own movie they focused on it they like main innocence in the game like pretend to be another Pokemon no I took his or Ark is cool I thought it did them like pushing it didn't seem to it seemed very forced but they also didn't push it for as long look Hari oh shut up in pokken tournament Lucario shows up in a lot of things I mean they've continued to push Lucario they go home they push you know at the time a few things for Zoroark but they really did not put the weight behind our arc that they did Lucario and zarach still came in number two in that 10 and that Jen if you look at it got very few votes overall like there just wasn't a huge anova push I think he is compared to suno so it's hard to say like it didn't work because there aren't coming in second for them pushing it hard for that one movie and then sort of backing off you know but I pushed it in the game too it still hits really hard but like Zoroark hasn't continued very far out of like zurich was never in pokken tournament it hasn't shown up in a bunch of the spin-off games whereas like Lucario does yeah has more media presence I don't know I could still argue that like Zurich didn't live up to their push like the other Pokemon did like if you look at the point value between Charizard Lucario greninja and zoroark all equal pushes I don't think they were equal pushes I think you know of us if you look at the numbers you know vote was definitely not marketed as hard as all the other one it definitely suffered I mean it it is just it's got lower vote totals across the board I think they didn't know what to do with you Nova and they they didn't do it well they get everything right in you Nova besides market it like the game yet were the right direction opt-ins were the right derive how to market it they just didn't know how to market it yeah what I'm saying I would say the big thing that was wrong with Gen 5 besides marketing was the anime was a bad direction right I think overall the media push for you Nova Kurt you Nova I I don't think it's easy to say that people who voted for Lucario liked it because this I think Lucario has had a much stronger media presence than anything in Genova the the votes clearly show that you Nova was the weakest Oh their Jen's and Lucario came back as a key player in X&Y a lot it's like like they threw that right back in your face Lucario is the first mega evolution Lucario was a mega evolution before Charizard yes like it's actually surprising to me that greninja did not make it into Galler and maybe that will change with the expansion but like just like there will never be a Pokemon game without Pikachu or Eevee there will never be a Pokemon game without Charizard and I can't imagine there will ever be a Pokemon game without Lucario like they're just too popular to cut and watch I don't know like the net like the next game they cut them but I mean I guess like if you I don't know if you like Charizard or look like uh if you like Luke re that much in Lucario wasn't in gallery I think those people sold a bot yeah I mean the greninja people clearly did I think the one thing that unites like Charizard and Lucario is their designs that their designs look fierce yet still remain cute like there's no soap oh c'mon there's a line that they really straddle very well with the sort of very strong look of them that still comes across as very friendly like it's not a mistake that chart like that Lucario looks like a dog that's not a mistake that chars eye looks like a dragon like they are pulling on very strong cultural ties and really hitting the that perfect kid bait point I agree people like dragons like dogs very true I love my dogs be number 30 by the way yeah okay it hard for a bomb B we'll take a break and then I think the last thing we have is just the disaster that will be marched for Pokemon go and then our question of the week and our Pokemon of the week so we will be right back [Music] [Music] Stardust bonuses shadow Entei thunderous and raids and more in March trainers there's just a lot break out your calendar and give us weight it doesn't say that yeah give us your money's give us your money okay there's a lot going on first thing before we get through all of us we'll try to make it as easy as possible and follow is that there was some cancellation for some events so players in Japan South Korea and Italy had some of their events postponed number one shadow ante from Giovanni nope I'm going to complete your rocket research that will be available to the end of March see and in case you didn't know Team Rocket never resets trainers so like if you were halfway through in January that will continue on into February and if you didn't finish in February continue on to March it only resets once you beat the Avani and then it starts over so the March research breakthrough encounter last month it was whoa bat I think the month before that was laparis it is now Feroz Eid and that will go until April first it will be available bonus Stardust this time around it can evolve into Ferrothorn stop here real quick people are really upset that is still not a legendary hasn't been legendary for a while yep I still think they're they're doing Legendary's through Team Rocket now yet but they haven't any new ones have a like it's been all the old right but that's it that's like but that's how it always was like if you were researching like Zapdos when normal trace when it first came out you were already like eight months behind when they were available in raids true I it's weird to me that people complain well that's not weird it's weird to me that there's something about that complain that they were saving their research bonus like fer weeks because they didn't want to get the woo bat and they were hoping that this would be a legendary if you are reading the Silph road and if you are playing Pokemon go everyday nope just nope and no cash in your like it's so it they the people just letting the throws to you people complaining it's like if the game is asking you to do one task a day to get the little stamp I mean I get so it's so easy is one of the easiest things to complete a week the only thing I will say about legendary is not happening in research is in places where there aren't a lot of pocus tops that was one of the easiest ways to be able to get access to Legendary's right and if it's moved to a stop based transaction that is once again hurting communities where they don't have a lot of stops yeah one appleís yeah I am none team rocket appears so much that if you're doing it one team rocket a day it appears at stops so if if you are in a city that has none and you have to travel for one like that is that's not born in the game though is traveling and leaving your house but how far do I have to go where no Poli stops by my house you owe your life will like that's like okay I have to make a 30 to 40 minute trip to get to one that's that's not like us that's not like us who can go five blocks and probably run into one that I don't buy that excuse because you still have to go to the stop to spin it to do the research task and some of the research tasks are you know walk four kilometers to hatch an egg and then you get the stamp like I it's I don't super buy that like you you still have to spend the stops to get the research tasks yeah but you have to then wait for that research text to be a rocket one which is random they you don't know you have to wait for a stop to become a rocket Wonder right which is random if there's one that you hit like you have to hope that you get it like it is it is not ideal and I can see why that upsets people there it should be in both like they should swap them out every once in a while is all I'm saying I get the complaint it's for a seed so I yeah it seems like they're very done with putting legendaries in there I wonder if you have figured out that like oh people whilst operating and just wait this out and if that is the case then venture thunderous come into five star raids starting on Monday March 2nd at 1:00 p.m. thunderous the bolt strike Pokemon will be in five star raids first discovered in the you know very jinnah lectric flying type okay oh here's the big stuff a month of legendary special raid weekends a month of it we're gonna start with dark cry oh gosh I actually didn't know is this coming weekend yeah it's right here dark dark cry special raid weekend will happen from Friday March 6 8 a.m. to Monday March 9th 10 p.m. local time and without using a gameshark this is the first time you can actually get shiny Darkrai unless I'm wrong on that I don't know yeah I don't I don't recall ever seeing a shiny dark right before now so I've seen people hunt Darkrai and they use I think it's called a tweaking glitch to get to the area cuz like em you in so the only way to get a shiny Mew is that if you have a Japanese copy of emerald you get an item called the old sea map yep and the old sea map which was never released in the United States let you go to visit the island where Mew was on and then you could Sofra set that Mew encounter and me you was that shiny locking didn't exist at that point was didn't exist until Gen 5 um so you could softer set and I'm pretty sure Darkrai and Shaymin and Arceus all needed events and I'm almost positive those events didn't come to America I think maybe one of them did but I don't actually know off the top of my head anytime I search for shiny Darkrai it's always like here's the action replay step so these are the codes you have to enter and I mean they've distributed Darkrai but the distributions were always locked dark rice first can be shiny all weekend and then the following weekend will be altered form Giratina special raid weekend that'll be March 13 through the 16th shiny Giratina coab alien will follow the week after that Friday to Monday the 20th to 23rd guess what cabal Ian's back it's shiny it has sacred sword it's almost like we said that exactly it was going to happen on the podcast that's why we all skipped cabal Ian's to be good and then again for the hundredth time lluvias coming back from Friday March 27th to the 30th and it will no an exclusive attack which I'm getting tired of this but it will no aerial blast and if you're lucky you can check counter a shiny lugia so every weekend in March it's to my raid event with you know a lot of Pokemon returning for the first time being shiny pokemon with exclusive moves that is not all don't worry there there there's more to this not only ok so I I get it that's clearly proven that people will go out like ok so two things one you don't have to do every event you're not interested in altered form Giratina cool you just don't have to do it thank you for the permission you're very welcome and number two I'm sure that their research has proven that like even though they know that all their players won't do it some of their players will do it and it will still be profitable and it will still be worth doing but there are players that want to get everything we've talked about this before I would like to get everything I have no problem playing to get everything but also even if you were more hardcore than me and I feel like I'm a pretty hardcore Pokemon go player is it actually reasonable to expect your players to have every Friday Saturday and Sunday free for two months straight because it's not like it's not like this was the first month they've done this we just came off of February where every weekend was an event and they're now doing it again I will give you Niantic answer in two parts part the first at least it's not eggs sure a second if it was destiny and they had an event every weekend you'd be sitting in your on your couch playing destiny for hours until you got that event so maybe I don't know if that's a super fair comparison because when Darkrai starts or when Garrett ena starts or when cabal Ian starts I don't know where it's going to be exactly and even if I go there I don't know if other games about going outside yeah no that's fine and so if they would have said like hey Darkrai will be this Saturday from 11:00 to 2:00 I know that other players will be there so this is the problem with the this past weekend with the clones so they put charizard blastoise venusaur in five star raids only for this weekend to celebrate Pokemon Day and I was at a convention where there were gyms and there were plenty of Pokemon players around and it was also very close to a park a very big park with good spawns and and good and plenty of gyms to see and I'll admit I wasn't I wasn't on the show floor a whole lot but I was around the PAC's area going from being a meeting I can't say that I was actually you know walking between booths but every time a four star raid popped it was a Marowak and that is that is actually the problem that I think is I am out and about and I and you're you're saying that these these three Pokemon are only available in four star raids for four days yet you're continuing to promote marowak's or you know how many beauty fly raids I saw this weekend who is doing beauty fly like oh yeah for sure three star beauty fly I wouldn't like look you know you wurmples I've hatched I can get a beautiful I can get Amelia beautifly right now I'm swimming in like 2,000 Wurmple candy that's my frustration that's why I was talk to you guys about like I want to do darker I'll do I'll give me an take 20 bucks I'll do 20 card Darkrai raids because I genuinely like dark cry I really do want a shiny hunt this one this is like the first Pokemon in a long time where I was like I actually care about Darkrai shiny but my whole worry is am I even gonna see dark eye raids because I couldn't I didn't even see a single Venus or all weekend and this was going from 30 minutes from Forest Hill to downtown Boston there's a two gyms and every single trade stop I walked through the park both days not a single fire four-star venusaur I saw Charizard and I saw one Blastoise that I was able to do but let me tell you I saw at least four hundred and beautifly's and fifty alone marowak's and I think that's more in the city of Boston there's on Niantic good Boston goes back to the earlier conversation of Pokemon go not being fair which is fine I accept that it's not a fair game but may I live in the 25th of twenty-fifth biggest city in the United States Milwaukee very big I don't have a problem seeing gyms from my house seeing stops from my house I can 15 minutes I can be downtown Milwaukee 15 minutes I can be to one of the best parks in the Wisconsin area to play pokemon go but man when you're in like a city like Boston it makes Milwaukee look like a joke when it comes to Pokemon go like I was able to do so many Team Rocket stops consistently I was able to just spin so many stops and it does help that that City has really good public transport and that city has a lot of a history to it to make a lot of stops but it just like I just imagined be if I lived in Boston I would have every single one of Giovanni's Pokemon heck I would probably have to shadow antes by now and it started today just because of how many stops and how many T market things it is so I I it made me appreciate that like I am lucky to be in the Milwaukee area and have good spawns and have good a good area to play pokemon go but there are just cities that are significantly better for Pokemon go yep and there were plenty of gyms I can do but they weren't the ones that knee antic was promoting so again this is this is my worry is like okay it's available for four days but unless like us three and three other people we could do any Darkrai raid but we got we're gonna have to we're gonna have to set aside time and drive to each one whereas from 11:00 to 2:00 we're gonna put Darkrai in every raid go where you feel comfortable you don't have to coordinate with your friends I mean it's weird because the longer weekend opens up to more people but the longer weekend also means you just have to be lucky and you have to have a raid group which some people are very lucky to have one unfortunately like I don't make me guys like you in Minnesota like you could you two could easily get a raid group and drive and find are crying there are a lot of gyms in downtown Minneapolis and there's an entire group of people all the business people who head out into the skyways at noon and wander around to do all these things like I can easily slide into that group and fall over running and jump in on all these things like it's but again I have like I have to give up my lunch hour to go do it and hope that in that time like granted there's a lot of options in downtown Minneapolis there are a lot of gems but it is a matter of in that in that time period will we see any like as much as we say Mall of America is a good spot they don't have a lot of gyms they have like even though and I was thinking about that too I was like do I just drop everything because I genuinely enjoy Pokemon go and do I Drive six hours in Minnesota this weekend to one hang out with you guys which would be a hundred percent worth it but like what what is our plan of action okay Greg and will do you guys just want to sit at Mall of America for ten hours because at least if a Darkrai pops we can do it but we can't guarantee Darkrai is going to pop and so the other option is okay we have to rope three more friends in and we have to drive to Reiter Aid which ideally should be fun but it's also hey are you ready to drop your entire weekend to do this like I I would because I'm passionate about Pokemon now repeat that four three four yeah coming off of repeating it for a few weeks like I would have if I wasn't traveling and like the three of us were in the city I would be like hey Greg well we can easily do Charizard Venus or Blastoise the three of us let's do it and so we each get one and then we call it a weekend but now repeat that every single week yeah I mean I could do it once like if you really want to do Darkrai I would happily do it but then the rest of the month is mine like I do things on the weekend yeah yeah I do so like I only get I only get a weekend like I do work a lot um and so I can do it once a month without feeling bitter towards the game you guys complained about the eggs now you're complaining about the raids what's next let's talk about okay yeah we could talk about what's next so from so there's another mysterious event coming from Friday March 20th to Monday March 23rd they don't specifically say what it's what it is but it will feature more normal fire water electric and ice pokemon in the wild nincada nincada will also be available so that's coming back it will be appearing in the wild hatching more from 5k eggs if you're lucky you can encounter a shiny one kara blasts and she'll mitt will be hatching from 5k eggs 1 to 4 star raid battles will feature various bug and steel type Pokemon let's go back we have back to the chart to figure out what that lines up with so cabal Ian's raid weekend is Friday March 20th through the 23rd so not only is cabal and we say Louis event a lot of people are going to but we have a mysterious event happening that weekend I don't know if it like takes a rocket scientist to figure out or like maybe you skipped gen 5 fire water Electric ice a bunch of bug type Pokemon spawning I don't know probably genesect that has four drives one being fire one being water one being electric one being ice it's a bug type Pokemon that's probably going to be like a repeat of the regigigas event but for genesect that weekend or shedinja is also like not a very mysterious weekend when it's right after the vernal equinox yeah I mean that and that is something I'm looking forward to right like I thought the regigigas event was good I travelled for it I went an hour south to do regigigas because I wanted an indoor place with a lot of stop gyms I thought it turned out great I thought it was worth the 9 bucks or whatever but that's another event on top of another event Team Rocket is going to be taking over this weekend March 6 to March 9th the same weekend as Darkrai so poison a dark-type pokémon will appearing the while absol will appear in the wild which sometimes will they made apps elope here for a little bit and then they took them away skur rupee will be able to be shiny and then on Saturday March 7 from 2 to 5 the team rocket global takeover will happen so there will be more Team Rocket stuff happening for the three hours shadowed pokemon rescued from the gym leaders have a chance of being shiny go gym leaders have switched up their Pokemon that they will be using you will be able to get charge TM to change your shadow pokémon's attack from frustration to other attacks your music will be different in the game it does Darkrai spawn during these 3 hours like what's happened I don't yeah I don't know like that I do but again if I come up to do dark ground Saturday are we just going to get 3 hours of no dark right which is actually the complaint I had of today's event of cool Gengar and knitter ant a knitter reno are in raids but also this is one of the last days to get the clone pokemon and now i you've cut them for 3 hours there already are hard to find but now you've cut them completely for 3 hours and I I can't see any of them there's another event psychic spectacular returns it's a if you were in playing Pokemon girl you feel like we were making these up from Friday the 27th to Monday of the 30th you can look forward to more psychic pokémon discovered in the you Nova region during the daytime you'll be able to encounter encounter soul OSIS which is the first time they're available in the game and Gothita they will also be available in 5k eggs psychic pokémon like drowsy and abre routes spoink ball toy why not beldum Gothita and soul OSIS will be hatching from eggs shiny bolt ball toy will be introduced psychic-type pokémon will be featured in raids you will see them more often and there will be psychic type research available Pokemon's spotlight our we'll be returning every Tuesday for the month of March Pokemon a mystery bonus hour will be a happening every Thursday in the month of March 6 p.m. for both those times local time and your community day Pokemon I believe is Abra does that officially announced yeah well whatever weekend I didn't say sorry I'm sure everyone was taking notes for this will be the community Day weekend with Abra and that's all of March it's literally my more than a full-time job it's way too much yes way too much like and I think of people who play World of Warcraft full-time you know eight years yeah forty hours a week or whatever that's the only game they play and I don't even think those games have that many infants no I mean we just we're about to do the lady's event and ff14 so there's that but it's like one a month the thing is is there's two ways to look at this the problem is that it hurts hardcore players because they have to do something all the time but the question is would they do it anyways and I think that's I'm a little like for me I just look at it and say I'm look I can't do this I'm just not right like you're just getting people to that or I could just skip it and it'll come around again like in some ways is building a healthy relationship with the game because it's so much that for a lot of people you have no choice but to say I can't I can't give this more I really can't especially you know when you're team rocket mystery you're big mystery event weekend is coming up with animal crossing hits oh yeah oh I didn't think about that now the Team Rocket one is this weekend are you saying the genesect event is yeah the mystery event weekend is because Animal Crossing hits the 20th of March well if it's like the regigigas event that takes that took me like two hours to complete but they did be they are now leaving there huh they are not leaving their homes they have to sit at home and pick weeds and pick fruit and and travel to other people's islands to get their fruit so I can get all the fruit look you got just this is just a strong push you have to become a passive player like me yeah and just chill pokeball Plus enjoy it that way complain about the hats you're good to go word I I have I've gotten to the point where I have no problem skipping but picking gym or curious of like is this going to hurt the game because I have seen hardcore people it said it seemed like a lot of them were throwing in the towel this this weekend when this news broke of like we just came off four weeks of constant stuff and you're hitting us with another four weeks I think it will tell like there's a couple ways to look at this this is a desperate chance to try to get a dwindling populace back in the game or this is a how far can we push it just before we lose I imagine if you're a no player and you're dying for content yeah this is a super exciting it's probably great it it's hard to say like there's so many people who would see this as a boon and there's so many people who would see it as Isis yeah like the other thing I think about this is a last point is like does like there is now it feels like there's now an optimal time to play pokemon go where you get the most benefits if they're going to do hey psychic-type pokémon are spawning more in the wild from Friday to Monday and they're repeating that for four weeks why even play Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and if you are gonna play Tuesday those other days that you go to your actual job right then if you do play Thursday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday why play when you know there's a better event happening at 6:00 whether that's double Stardust double xp double candy uh you know more spawns higher shiny chance like well if I only have an hour to play on Tuesday I'm gonna try to make it at six because it's more beneficial for me and if I only have you know 20 hours a week to play pokemon go why would I not save that till Friday Saturday Sunday I don't know like that's like a more of an interesting like not a problem but like a thing I feel like they're setting up mentally um obviously there's a small percentage that will play every day no matter what but if you're trying to manage other video games and I don't know life you can't have to plan for when you're gonna be able to do stuff yep we'll figure out the dark red stuff okay yeah okay I cry save all our questions of the week for the mega episode the 400 and then we're just gonna have no voice anyways so we're gonna just do our pokemon of the week and wrap it up alright Pokemon of the week there it's real quick both sides but start looking up the trivia for this one basically if you're a pokemon mystery dungeon player and you played the rescue team versions of pokemon mystery dungeon then you know that you take a quiz at the beginning and then that's what picks the pokemon that you awaken as in the game because you wake up as a pokemon and the questions that i selected question and answer pairs that i selected for last week's pokemon of the week greg did you do the research that brings you to match up ma chop correct there's some weird things about it basically it's it's based on the nature so the way that you answer the questions determines what nature of Pokemon you are with Machop specifically if you are all brave or have brave is the highest and you are male then that's when you get matchup super great Pokemon shuffle icon fYI my chops a little cutie I'll tell us it is uh we've done my job before probably my chaps matter chap the only trivia is in the English versions of before the English versions of red and blue it was known as karate so what would the other ones have been then isn't what I think my champ wasn't it's like free English name was like judo or something like that Oh probably if I remember my Machamp trivia it was yeah jus - doh judo boo that's the only trivia that's the only treasure yeah a lot for a champ yeah all right so very very short Pokemon of the week this week a little tougher Bert especially for people who only play pokemon mystery dungeon you'll have no idea what's going on here we go um it's a poem again I like to do poems occasionally the name of the poem is sunkern the goth corn prince sunkern the goth corn prince has been dethroned who has taken the unbeatable spot of the Pokemon with the lowest combined stat total of all weep for the grass types the usurper when touched by mommy will be unmoved and yet the wandering spirit I have yet to see tales have stated it can take your multiform ground has taken a lesson from the ocean finally who can tell when you start with one over level twenty over 25% HP all of its friends come to the party when they leave are you sure yours stayed behind the modern era so easily takes away young fish you too may someday be unseated there you go there's your pokemon of the week okay when this episode goes up on YouTube or reddit if you have any questions for our 400th episode feel free to comment on those and we'll collect them all up YouTube is same as Twitter same as twitch just PKM and cast as always and then and then if you are in the slack we will ask those questions closer to the 400th episode sort of hang tight on that and then if you are looking for to the voicemail thing that we're gonna be doing we'll explain that next week we yeah we want to have just step away from the news for a full episode and just kind of focus on the people who listen to the show that's our plan for episode 400 yay Greg's at white-winged on Twitter we'll is that washing the sink I am at dragging a lake twitter is PK man cast now probably older episodes a Pokemon podcast but we got that Twitter handle updated match everything else I expect now that Pokemon Day is over fingers crossed that these episodes won't be pushing two and a half hours bangers good a lot of Pokemon news to lead up of Pokemon Day but we got a while until the DLC mystery dungeon comes out soon I don't know anything else coming and I think all the Pokemon go news
