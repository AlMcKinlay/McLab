it was beautiful into me it was (3:03 - 3:06)
beautiful and amazing and then I (3:04 - 3:09)
promptly sugar crashed for an hour and a (3:06 - 3:12)
half at 2:00 she's where I was like I'm (3:09 - 3:14)

went straight to the gym and lifted for (3:18 - 3:23)
like an hour and a half I was amazing (3:20 - 3:26)
was Greg's dish it came to the table and (3:23 - 3:33)
it was still moving deflated in on it so (3:26 - 3:37)

well we got sugary show for you guys got (3:39 - 3:44)
a lot of got a lot to get through as (3:41 - 3:47)
Pokemon day I just got I literally got (3:44 - 3:48)
off the plane from pax (3:47 - 3:51)
a couple hours ago I am very tired (3:48 - 3:55)
chanting I did not want to put Greg and (3:51 - 3:57)
will in charge of the episode after (3:55 - 4:04)
Pokemon Day do you your most popular (3:57 - 4:05)
shows witness just the two of us that's (4:04 - 4:07)
probably that's your right here that's (4:05 - 4:09)
probably accurate that's like you know (4:07 - 4:10)
you know saying I'm not coming for (4:09 - 4:12)
Christmas I gotta be here for Pokemon (4:10 - 4:20)
Day news recently because because I was (4:12 - 4:23)
thinking of all the haters and do you (4:20 - 4:25)
remember Greg there's an episode that (4:23 - 4:28)
you and I did together I think was it (4:25 - 4:31)
Bobby that we had or yeah and we went (4:28 - 4:33)
through the map of Galler (4:31 - 4:36)
like it was like our treasure trove of (4:33 - 4:39)
joy and yeah yeah anticipation as well I (4:36 - 4:42)
was on my honeymoon yeah so all y'all (4:39 - 4:44)
haters go back to episode whatever that (4:42 - 4:47)
was and you'll understand what life is (4:44 - 4:51)
laughter before we get in (4:47 - 4:54)
to our show speaking of you know older (4:51 - 4:57)
episodes newer episodes we are very very (4:54 - 5:00)
close to episode 400 it's around the (4:57 - 5:00)
corner (5:00 - 5:04)
isn't this what 398 yes yes so it's (5:00 - 5:06)
about two weeks away so we're gonna do (5:04 - 5:09)
two things one thing is we will be doing (5:06 - 5:13)
a bunch of listener I don't want to say (5:09 - 5:15)
email cuz I'm not telling people to (5:13 - 5:18)
email in but this podcast has been going (5:15 - 5:23)
up on YouTube so that will be one way if (5:18 - 5:24)
you want to ask a question or hang out (5:23 - 5:28)
you can just ask in the comments below (5:24 - 5:29)
on YouTube what your question is Pokemon (5:28 - 5:31)
or non Pokemon related obviously we (5:29 - 5:32)
probably won't be able to get to every (5:31 - 5:35)
question on our 400th episode and then (5:32 - 5:38)
another way is going to be through (5:35 - 5:41)
Reddit when the episode goes up you if (5:38 - 5:44)
you go to our sub subreddit which is our (5:41 - 5:46)
slash super-effective (5:44 - 5:48)
you'll be able to leave a question there (5:46 - 5:52)
and then next week we will have a Google (5:48 - 5:56)
Voice number set up so if and the reason (5:52 - 5:57)
we're not doing it this week is because (5:56 - 6:00)
people are super forgetful and they when (5:57 - 6:02)
I say there's only a week left to do it (6:00 - 6:03)
there's more they're more likely to do (6:02 - 6:05)
it so the Google Voice if you want to (6:03 - 6:08)
leave a voicemail that will go up next (6:05 - 6:09)
week episode will tell you what the (6:08 - 6:11)
number is and stuff so you have a bunch (6:09 - 6:13)
of different ways obviously if you're in (6:11 - 6:15)
slack will have a will have questions (6:13 - 6:18)
there so episode 400 is going to be very (6:15 - 6:20)
question community-focused from you guys (6:18 - 6:24)
questions about Galler or older pokemon (6:20 - 6:26)
games or whether what makes a chair a (6:24 - 6:32)
chair so you can no denied ass ask away (6:26 - 6:35)
for that and we got a loaded show so we (6:32 - 6:37)
have the top 10 Pokemon we have the new (6:35 - 6:39)
mythical that was revealed we had a (6:37 - 6:41)
Mewtwo event and sword and shield we (6:39 - 6:46)
have the most packed month in Pokemon go (6:41 - 6:49)
if you thought February was packed strap (6:46 - 6:52)
on in for March and we got some new (6:49 - 6:53)
Pokemon Center stuff so we're gonna try (6:52 - 6:56)
to get through all of that and masters (6:53 - 6:58)
oh yeah a master sorry I do have the (6:56 - 7:00)
masters tab up I do have that up let's (6:58 - 7:03)
jump into things (7:00 - 7:05)
let's let's actually start with the (7:03 - 7:08)
Mewtwo stuff let's start there (7:05 - 7:11)
the MU the movie came out on Netflix on (7:08 - 7:14)
I'm Thursday Pokemon day I have not seen (7:11 - 7:15)
it yet (7:14 - 7:16)
because I've been traveling all weekend (7:15 - 7:20)
so I know Irene and I will be doing a (7:16 - 7:24)
patreon exclusive anime episode for the (7:20 - 7:26)
me to movie probably not you know this (7:24 - 7:28)
week but probably next week just because (7:26 - 7:31)
I set aside two hours to watch that I (7:28 - 7:33)
can't I forgot this movies like a (7:31 - 7:35)
hundred and like it's like an hour and (7:33 - 7:38)
forty minutes long it's a very it's (7:35 - 7:40)
longer than it should be but maybe I'm (7:38 - 7:42)
misremembering it I remember Minnie it's (7:40 - 7:45)
not even that long it's slightly over an (7:42 - 7:47)
hour and a half that's like three (7:45 - 7:50)
episodes of the end but there's like at (7:47 - 7:52)
least 30 minutes of that you can cut (7:50 - 7:53)
well there's 30 minutes of everything (7:52 - 7:55)
you can cut there's 30 minutes of this (7:53 - 7:59)
show we could always come in we do the (7:55 - 8:02)
parts where Steve is talking yeah but (7:59 - 8:04)
that came out and then armored meets you (8:02 - 8:06)
came back to raids in Pokemon go and (8:04 - 8:09)
they decided to put Dynomax (8:06 - 8:12)
forms of Mewtwo Bulbasaur Ivysaur (8:09 - 8:13)
Charmander Charmeleon squirtle and (8:12 - 8:16)
Wartortle in pokemon sword and pokemon (8:13 - 8:18)
shield max raid battles and this all (8:16 - 8:20)
this will definitely be over by the time (8:18 - 8:22)
his podcasts up when it goes up but it (8:20 - 8:26)
was from February 26 in the evening and (8:22 - 8:30)
then it ended March 1st and they (8:26 - 8:32)
appeared all throughout the wild area I (8:30 - 8:34)
think each of these Pokemon had like a (8:32 - 8:37)
10% chance to spawn they finally did (8:34 - 8:42)
something to in a main series video game (8:37 - 8:45)
on Pokemon Day there was that one weird (8:42 - 8:47)
Pokemon day where they gave us hidden (8:45 - 8:49)
ability starters like two weeks after (8:47 - 8:51)
Pokemon day through Pokemon Bay yes (8:49 - 8:53)
which I still probably assumed that (8:51 - 8:55)
those were meant for Pokemon Day but (8:53 - 8:57)
probably had technical issues we didn't (8:55 - 8:59)
get just a downloadable Pokemon which I (8:57 - 9:01)
still think is something they kind of (8:59 - 9:04)
should do but this was cool this was (9:01 - 9:07)
like III would probably argue this was (9:04 - 9:09)
one of the better Pokemon days content (9:07 - 9:13)
wise across their multiple platforms (9:09 - 9:15)
that the Pokemon company likes to (9:13 - 9:17)
dominate did you guys Mewtwo (9:15 - 9:22)
I did my word (9:17 - 9:25)
we certainly did although I still don't (9:22 - 9:30)
think I've ever defeated a special (9:25 - 9:33)
focused one although I have defeated I (9:30 - 9:35)
defeated me to four times and I have (9:33 - 9:37)
lost track of which ones I fought but I (9:35 - 9:40)
I want to say for sure three of them (9:37 - 9:43)
were the physical attacker how can you (9:40 - 9:45)
tell the difference whether it used (9:43 - 9:50)
earthquake or seismic sigh strike or (9:45 - 9:52)
blizzard I think a blizzard would have (9:50 - 9:55)
been the special yeah because I had the (9:52 - 9:57)
night that you and I tried to do it it (9:55 - 9:59)
was like blizzard hail blizzard yeah do (9:57 - 10:02)
whatever that was one the special one (9:59 - 10:04)
was definitely harder and I think the (10:02 - 10:06)
special one starts with shields yeah at (10:04 - 10:07)
least all the special ones that I ran (10:06 - 10:09)
and she started with shields and all the (10:07 - 10:11)
physical ones didn't so trying to think (10:09 - 10:13)
about that I think I did defeat one (10:11 - 10:16)
special one but as rough well I have (10:13 - 10:18)
yeah I have a level 100 sent to scorch (10:16 - 10:20)
and I think I have a level 100 grim (10:18 - 10:24)
snarl now trying to that dude with no (10:20 - 10:27)
luck if you missed if you missed the (10:24 - 10:29)
Mewtwo stuff you couldn't catch it so I (10:27 - 10:31)
think some people were really bummed (10:29 - 10:35)
about that although because of how hard (10:31 - 10:36)
it was I feel like they could have made (10:35 - 10:38)
a catchable cuz I don't think you could (10:36 - 10:39)
have just grind it out (10:38 - 10:42)
no you afternoon cuz even if you have a (10:39 - 10:44)
strategy there's still there's still (10:42 - 10:47)
definitely some RNG to it of like oh (10:44 - 10:49)
well I guess meat you just decided to (10:47 - 10:52)
use all four moves on one person right (10:49 - 10:54)
and there's no way no matter how many (10:52 - 10:56)
shields and whatever you're gonna be (10:54 - 10:59)
able to survive just for attack straight (10:56 - 11:03)
I say though much like most MMOs like (10:59 - 11:06)
the first day everybody has no idea what (11:03 - 11:09)
to do in the dungeon yesterday last (11:06 - 11:10)
night when I went in there like (11:09 - 11:12)
literally went in and picked one up and (11:10 - 11:15)
the ones to use on me to everybody (11:12 - 11:18)
brought one like nobody hit okay until (11:15 - 11:20)
they saw what everybody had selected and (11:18 - 11:22)
they wouldn't change like by the end of (11:20 - 11:24)
the weekend everybody knew what the (11:22 - 11:27)
strat was yeah even with random people (11:24 - 11:30)
so it's sort of interesting how (11:27 - 11:33)
rady that really felt like how compared (11:30 - 11:35)
to final fantasy 14 because by the fans (11:33 - 11:38)
14 also had a patch and that first day (11:35 - 11:40)
of doing those dungeons when nobody knew (11:38 - 11:43)
anything was a nightmare and then three (11:40 - 11:45)
days later you're just flying through it (11:43 - 11:47)
and that's how I felt this was that (11:45 - 11:49)
first day was exciting and hard and (11:47 - 11:51)
frustrating but last night I'm like oh (11:49 - 11:53)
I'll just throw went up and literally (11:51 - 11:55)
everybody knows what to bring and they (11:53 - 11:56)
all brought the right ones and we (11:55 - 11:58)
cleared it no problem I think it was (11:56 - 11:59)
like frustrating in a good way (11:58 - 12:01)
frustrating in a way of like failing a (11:59 - 12:04)
dungeon or a boss and Final Fantasy 14 (12:01 - 12:05)
and being like don't worry we'll just do (12:04 - 12:07)
it again we're getting better every time (12:05 - 12:09)
right we're figuring out what it does (12:07 - 12:11)
and how to tell which is which and what (12:09 - 12:13)
does like should I throw up a light (12:11 - 12:15)
screen show throw up or reflect like (12:13 - 12:18)
lights we didn't reflect were absolutely (12:15 - 12:20)
necessary yeah this is how you can tell (12:18 - 12:22)
I don't play mmo's because I was just (12:20 - 12:27)
wow I was in the woods on Wednesday (12:22 - 12:30)
night and by Thursday I was over it so (12:27 - 12:33)
mmm I could live without the new - so (12:30 - 12:35)
like a 5 star raid in sword and shield (12:33 - 12:38)
those Pokemon are usually around level (12:35 - 12:41)
60 and then if it was a G max Pokemon (12:38 - 12:45)
like G max toxicity for example that the (12:41 - 12:47)
5 star that would be closer to a level (12:45 - 12:51)
70 this Mewtwo was level 100 and it (12:47 - 12:53)
definitely did punish you if you brought (12:51 - 12:56)
a weaker Pokemon yep absolutely it has (12:53 - 12:59)
extremely good type coverage so it could (12:56 - 13:03)
handle super effective hit quite a few (12:59 - 13:05)
different Pokemon and there were Pokemon (13:03 - 13:08)
that definitely stood out that were (13:05 - 13:10)
quickly realized that were better than (13:08 - 13:12)
other Pokemon to use surprisingly (13:10 - 13:15)
eternity eternity za Shion and zama (13:12 - 13:20)
Zenta at least for the dozens of (13:15 - 13:22)
Mewtwo's I did where were not one of the (13:20 - 13:24)
like the top ones to pick they weren't I (13:22 - 13:27)
had I had good success with Drago Pulte (13:24 - 13:28)
if I didn't bring my crimson arrow (13:27 - 13:30)
oh I never I had really good success (13:28 - 13:33)
with go Lysa pod because Mewtwo didn't (13:30 - 13:35)
hit weakness ongal isopods at all and (13:33 - 13:39)
i'd and it was also so I ran glice a pod (13:35 - 13:43)
with assault vest hmm oh that would have (13:39 - 13:44)
been useful (13:43 - 13:46)
yeah I'm helped a lot held items helped (13:44 - 13:48)
a lot especially if you never if you (13:46 - 13:50)
weren't a Pokemon that like set up (13:48 - 13:53)
support items or healed a saw Fest was a (13:50 - 13:55)
really good one especially against the (13:53 - 13:58)
the especially a special attacking me to (13:55 - 14:01)
and dragon pot was so fast that I could (13:58 - 14:04)
get a dark move off and I could also do (14:01 - 14:06)
phantom force which it means I would (14:04 - 14:07)
disappear for a round which helped (14:06 - 14:10)
mitigate damage while coming back and (14:07 - 14:12)
being able to super effective damage so (14:10 - 14:14)
there's a couple of things like planning (14:12 - 14:17)
that out worked really well but I will (14:14 - 14:18)
say during what was harder to use than (14:17 - 14:20)
the others I usually just brought grim (14:18 - 14:24)
snarl because I had T wave both screens (14:20 - 14:26)
and then the one dark pipe move and it (14:24 - 14:29)
was prankster so so here's a question do (14:26 - 14:33)
moves like faint that get past protect (14:29 - 14:34)
and stuff like that I think faint is the (14:33 - 14:36)
one that gets past protect I think (14:34 - 14:39)
phantom force also gets past protect do (14:36 - 14:42)
they get past the shields or no no they (14:39 - 14:45)
they do what also perfective moves do (14:42 - 14:47)
they'll knock down one shield and (14:45 - 14:50)
sometimes damage behind the shield I was (14:47 - 14:52)
doing damage like breaking shield and (14:50 - 14:56)
doing some damage as well but not not (14:52 - 14:59)
the same as it was by passing no hmm I (14:56 - 15:01)
thought the reward items were great I (14:59 - 15:04)
thought it was worth the trouble doing (15:01 - 15:07)
it in my opinion you could get rare (15:04 - 15:08)
candy (15:07 - 15:10)
large candy usually that came in like 10 (15:08 - 15:13)
to 20 extra large candy which again came (15:10 - 15:16)
in 10 to 20 bottle caps and then some (15:13 - 15:18)
other items but the important thing that (15:16 - 15:19)
I mean some people might care about was (15:18 - 15:22)
ability capsules yeah I was surprised I (15:19 - 15:24)
didn't think I was gonna get ability (15:22 - 15:26)
capsules like it wasn't aware that was a (15:24 - 15:27)
gift I'm like I got one I'm like oh (15:26 - 15:28)
sweet (15:27 - 15:30)
yeah not all Mewtwo's dropped ability (15:28 - 15:33)
capsules I think I ended up beating like (15:30 - 15:36)
a closer to 15 Mewtwo's and I walked (15:33 - 15:39)
away with 8 or 9 ability capsules and if (15:36 - 15:40)
you do the math on that real quick (15:39 - 15:43)
that's you know 400 to 450 battle points (15:40 - 15:45)
those ability capsules would have (15:43 - 15:49)
equaled yeah and so that to me I liked (15:45 - 15:53)
once like it took me 3 hours to beat my (15:49 - 15:55)
first me too and it was you know I was (15:53 - 15:58)
rating with people in I'm (15:55 - 15:59)
twitch channel and some were getting (15:58 - 16:01)
frustrated and dropping out some people (15:59 - 16:02)
were like hey I'm gonna need some time (16:01 - 16:04)
to you know pick a Pokemon level it up (16:02 - 16:07)
I'm gonna like sit back and watch (16:04 - 16:09)
so it was like rotating through people (16:07 - 16:10)
and understanding what worked what (16:09 - 16:12)
didn't work I'm figuring out oh there's (16:10 - 16:14)
different Mewtwo's and they know these (16:12 - 16:17)
moves are this moves but once you've got (16:14 - 16:19)
it down and once you had a competent (16:17 - 16:21)
team it would only take like one or two (16:19 - 16:24)
tries to get through Mewtwo if everyone (16:21 - 16:26)
knew what they were doing unless you got (16:24 - 16:28)
the bad luck of like you to just single (16:26 - 16:30)
targeting you know when one pitch (16:28 - 16:32)
happened and things that was hard to do (16:30 - 16:34)
that was hard to get around but you had (16:32 - 16:35)
no choice (16:34 - 16:37)
like you didn't know it was like one one (16:35 - 16:39)
of mine it did brick break to break all (16:37 - 16:41)
the shields and then hit me with three (16:39 - 16:44)
moves and I'm like well that was fun (16:41 - 16:45)
yeah it doesn't really matter how bulky (16:44 - 16:47)
you are usually what it killed you I (16:45 - 16:49)
thought it was great though I thought it (16:47 - 16:52)
was fantastic I want to see more of this (16:49 - 16:55)
and I think the difficulty to reward (16:52 - 16:56)
ratio was perfect (16:55 - 16:58)
I think the standout Pokemon in all of (16:56 - 17:00)
the raids which reminded me of a very (16:58 - 17:02)
big destiny thing will would know (17:00 - 17:05)
exactly what I'm talking about in crotas (17:02 - 17:07)
end which is a raid in the first destiny (17:05 - 17:10)
game people would people would only (17:07 - 17:13)
invite you if you told them you had (17:10 - 17:14)
Gjallarhorn (17:13 - 17:17)
Yallah horn so like if you were trying (17:14 - 17:19)
to get into a crota's end raid and you (17:17 - 17:21)
were like hey I got Gjallarhorn people (17:19 - 17:24)
would be like oh you're in that's what (17:21 - 17:26)
we want we want as many gala horns as (17:24 - 17:29)
possible and in Mewtwo I felt like if (17:26 - 17:32)
you had a marsh shadow you were in you (17:29 - 17:34)
were in like we we need were looking for (17:32 - 17:37)
one marshal you and you only need one (17:34 - 17:38)
marsh shadow two would have been not (17:37 - 17:40)
great in my opinion but if you had that (17:38 - 17:42)
one marsh shadow you were in like oh we (17:40 - 17:44)
got we got aggro everyone had a grim (17:42 - 17:46)
snarl everyone had like a Lapras I (17:44 - 17:48)
thought Jellison twas doing pretty good (17:46 - 17:51)
but it was always like who has more (17:48 - 17:52)
shadow who is the mark we need one I (17:51 - 17:55)
looking for one Marsha uh I think it was (17:52 - 17:59)
Sam who we were raiding with who got his (17:55 - 18:01)
like he invested to get his jealous end (17:59 - 18:03)
up and that thing still got destroyed (18:01 - 18:08)
yeah was good bulky I did it without (18:03 - 18:10)
Marsh shadow stop subbing in drag a (18:08 - 18:11)
pulse (18:10 - 18:13)
uh with understanding that a person (18:11 - 18:17)
brought in something with taunt cuz (18:13 - 18:19)
taunt yeah stop the sad increases that (18:17 - 18:21)
Marsh had it was stealing so there were (18:19 - 18:23)
a couple ways around it but having (18:21 - 18:26)
Marsha that was definitely easier which (18:23 - 18:27)
is I'm still a little weird about that (18:26 - 18:29)
so for those that don't know Marsha (18:27 - 18:31)
Marsha shadow actually had the easiest (18:29 - 18:33)
strat you just came in and you did one (18:31 - 18:35)
single move and it's March shadow (18:33 - 18:37)
signature move which is called spectral (18:35 - 18:40)
thief and usually um so this is what I (18:37 - 18:41)
was a little bit confused about why (18:40 - 18:43)
marsh shadows worked and no one else's (18:41 - 18:45)
did like let's say you had a G max (18:43 - 18:49)
Lapras and G Max is G max Lapras is G (18:45 - 18:53)
max move signature move is is like G max (18:49 - 18:56)
resistance or something but what it does (18:53 - 18:57)
is it does ice damage and then it sets (18:56 - 19:01)
up both light screen and reflect but if (18:57 - 19:03)
you did that G max move when you two had (19:01 - 19:06)
shields up it would not do the secondary (19:03 - 19:09)
effect same like if you two have shields (19:06 - 19:10)
up you can't paralyze it you can't put (19:09 - 19:12)
it to sleep you can't taunt it when a (19:10 - 19:14)
Heche shields up well that's like if you (19:12 - 19:17)
use a Dynomax move and the Pokemon has (19:14 - 19:19)
shields up you don't ever get the field (19:17 - 19:21)
effect right which is the secondary (19:19 - 19:23)
effect but Mar shadows secondary effect (19:21 - 19:26)
worked with shields up which was kind of (19:23 - 19:28)
weird yeah and what it did for those (19:26 - 19:30)
that don't know so like if Mewtwo did (19:28 - 19:32)
nastyplot which would increase its (19:30 - 19:35)
special attack by two and then it did (19:32 - 19:38)
nastyplot again so now it's plus for a (19:35 - 19:40)
special attack when marsh shadow (19:38 - 19:43)
connects and does its move it steals all (19:40 - 19:46)
the buffs that Mewtwo would have so it (19:43 - 19:48)
would steal the Plus for some you too (19:46 - 19:50)
would be back down to normal zero but (19:48 - 19:52)
then Mar shadow would have the +4 and (19:50 - 19:55)
then do its attack afterwards and maybe (19:52 - 19:57)
that's why it gets through because it (19:55 - 20:00)
does this the first thing first and then (19:57 - 20:03)
it does the damage but it's a signature (20:00 - 20:05)
move of marsh Chado so if Mewtwo was you (20:03 - 20:07)
know plus two special defense plus two (20:05 - 20:09)
special attack marsh shadow would steal (20:07 - 20:11)
that for itself which is very beneficial (20:09 - 20:13)
to the entire team because once Mewtwo (20:11 - 20:15)
had a plus two or plus four it was (20:13 - 20:18)
getting almost the point where which one (20:15 - 20:20)
shot anything (20:18 - 20:22)
suspicion is it's because it wasn't a (20:20 - 20:24)
Dynomax move and it's only the Dynomax (20:22 - 20:25)
moves that don't get their secondary (20:24 - 20:29)
effects possibly possibly also I just (20:25 - 20:32)
feel like maybe they just said you know (20:29 - 20:34)
it if you happen to have a Martian oh (20:32 - 20:37)
just let it like just let it work you (20:34 - 20:39)
know I think there's a lot of what (20:37 - 20:41)
there's a lot of signature moves that (20:39 - 20:43)
are brand-new that weren't included when (20:41 - 20:45)
they did the base game that they're just (20:43 - 20:47)
like you know what it's fine (20:45 - 20:49)
now that any people have it and sure (20:47 - 20:51)
just let it happen but I'm not gonna go (20:49 - 20:54)
in and fix it not for a one-off rate (20:51 - 20:56)
event just Mewtwo makes me excited for (20:54 - 21:01)
the raids in the DLC yeah I think if (20:56 - 21:03)
you're going to make something difficult (21:01 - 21:05)
and we know that some Pokemon fans have (21:03 - 21:10)
been asking for difficulty for years and (21:05 - 21:11)
you know if you're gonna make a trainer (21:10 - 21:14)
fail and make it like let me back up (21:11 - 21:18)
scratch all that when they showed max (21:14 - 21:21)
rates for the first time I was hoping it (21:18 - 21:23)
would be like what Mewtwo was I was (21:21 - 21:27)
hoping that every person brought a (21:23 - 21:30)
Pokemon because that Pokemon mattered to (21:27 - 21:34)
that fight and not well every single (21:30 - 21:36)
three-star well with the exception of (21:34 - 21:39)
some five stars every three star and (21:36 - 21:41)
four star raid is just people flexing (21:39 - 21:43)
their shinies and you know and it can be (21:41 - 21:46)
and that's fine like those those are not (21:43 - 21:51)
banned those are not flexor shinies when (21:46 - 21:53)
it's appropriate for that rate thank you (21:51 - 21:56)
very much like me like for example I (21:53 - 21:58)
like when when Mewtwo was relatively new (21:56 - 22:00)
we were like two hours in mu2 I've (21:58 - 22:02)
already failed it three times and then (22:00 - 22:04)
somebody somebody wanted to join the (22:02 - 22:06)
raid and they joined with a level 100 (22:04 - 22:09)
shiny synaesthesia (22:06 - 22:12)
didn't ask any questions they just were (22:09 - 22:13)
like Oh Steve has an open spot I'm (22:12 - 22:15)
joining I want to flex and I was like (22:13 - 22:18)
like I like it's rude to say but I was (22:15 - 22:20)
like oh we instantly lost like we cannot (22:18 - 22:23)
win now because you locked in the (22:20 - 22:24)
sinister and they were like well it's (22:23 - 22:27)
level 100 and I was like look we I've (22:24 - 22:28)
been no measure I was doing this for (22:27 - 22:31)
like an hour and a half I get you just (22:28 - 22:33)
got here but and then (22:31 - 22:34)
they were upset at the end of it that it (22:33 - 22:37)
was too hard it was like well I don't (22:34 - 22:39)
know what to tell you like you brought (22:37 - 22:42)
the wrong Pokemon but yeah but there was (22:39 - 22:43)
never that expectation before right (22:42 - 22:46)
because you could beat a GMAX (22:43 - 22:48)
you know level 70 toxicity with a you (22:46 - 22:51)
know level 100 synergy trust I've got (22:48 - 22:54)
about eight extra sins if anybody wants (22:51 - 22:57)
one I have a lot so anyways I just it (22:54 - 22:59)
really really hit that like Final (22:57 - 23:02)
Fantasy definitely in that feeling (22:59 - 23:07)
strong MMO feel and I can't wait for MMO (23:02 - 23:09)
dungeons to happen in the second gonna (23:07 - 23:12)
be a disappointment get one hallway Greg (23:09 - 23:15)
Noel either saving the MMO dungeons for (23:12 - 23:17)
pokemon mystery dungeon which is coming (23:15 - 23:19)
out this Friday II I was reading it (23:17 - 23:22)
though I was remembering for the first (23:19 - 23:23)
time remember how excited we were when (23:22 - 23:28)
they showed the place where the ultra (23:23 - 23:32)
ultra recon squad headquarters and at (23:28 - 23:33)
the top was when you like fight (23:32 - 23:36)
alternate Kosma but when you get there (23:33 - 23:38)
it's it's not even a hallway so it's (23:36 - 23:40)
like an open square and then you can't (23:38 - 23:43)
do anything but go up an elevator that's (23:40 - 23:47)
my expectations are that for the coop (23:43 - 23:49)
dungeons that you go into for the dens (23:47 - 23:50)
like oh it's just a hallway and then (23:49 - 23:52)
when you get to be I mean it could be a (23:50 - 23:54)
winding hallway like ultra wormholes (23:52 - 23:56)
were as long as there's an out of the (23:54 - 24:00)
cave thing in X&Y anything an accident (23:56 - 24:02)
way like you're walking like you kind of (24:00 - 24:04)
have that crash bandicoot and then (24:02 - 24:06)
you're like turning it like that was not (24:04 - 24:10)
CI I'm gladly try it but it wasn't fun I (24:06 - 24:12)
mean I don't know how they're gonna do (24:10 - 24:14)
that with what if your co-op with four (24:12 - 24:15)
people (24:14 - 24:17)
yeah I don't you know I don't know I (24:15 - 24:21)
just I was really happy to do yeah (24:17 - 24:23)
the other cool thing that they did was (24:21 - 24:25)
the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur had a chance (24:23 - 24:27)
of dropping toxic orb the Charmeleon a (24:25 - 24:28)
Charmander had a drop chance of dropping (24:27 - 24:30)
flame orb and the squirt on the (24:28 - 24:32)
Wartortle had a chance of dropping life (24:30 - 24:35)
orb blame orb very sought-after people (24:32 - 24:37)
were trading a master ball for a flame (24:35 - 24:38)
war because those people cared about (24:37 - 24:40)
competitive they didn't care about you (24:38 - 24:41)
know saving their basketball for some (24:40 - 24:43)
shiny or anything which is (24:41 - 24:44)
understandable and I think that was (24:43 - 24:47)
always a fair trade although the fact (24:44 - 24:50)
that flame herb was all already (24:47 - 24:52)
ridiculous to get in the first place was (24:50 - 24:55)
kind of weird because they knew how that (24:52 - 24:59)
item is very valuable to competitive but (24:55 - 25:01)
again I think that is a good reward (24:59 - 25:04)
forces like the rewards were so good (25:01 - 25:05)
that if you haven't played in a month I (25:04 - 25:08)
felt like this was the thing to come (25:05 - 25:09)
back to you might not care about (25:08 - 25:11)
toxicity maybe didn't care about mill (25:09 - 25:15)
story but if you were if you were (25:11 - 25:19)
missing key items if you were wanting to (25:15 - 25:22)
get hidden ability starter Pokemon if (25:19 - 25:24)
you wanted I did and if you wanted to (25:22 - 25:27)
try to challenge me to I thought I (25:24 - 25:29)
thought this was the best like four days (25:27 - 25:32)
that they did raid wise (25:29 - 25:34)
yeah it was pretty fun yeah I wish I had (25:32 - 25:36)
known about the starter Pokemon because (25:34 - 25:38)
I actually when I got up this morning I (25:36 - 25:42)
saw that Micah was doing raids and I saw (25:38 - 25:44)
that he was doing like Bulbasaur and all (25:42 - 25:46)
that biz I couldn't get in on him cuz (25:44 - 25:48)
they filled up too fast and I was like (25:46 - 25:49)
oh that's interesting they're doing the (25:48 - 25:51)
starters and I didn't realize that they (25:49 - 25:53)
were really good starters yeah well you (25:51 - 25:55)
don't always get the hidden ability once (25:53 - 25:57)
again it's hit or miss but yeah and it (25:55 - 25:58)
should get all the hidden ability once (25:57 - 26:01)
and I managed to get each starter in a (25:58 - 26:04)
luxury ball so I can breed them in (26:01 - 26:06)
luxury balls and I'm very happy about (26:04 - 26:06)
that (26:06 - 26:10)
speaking of luxury though part of the (26:06 - 26:13)
whole Pokemon day thing was the Pokemon (26:10 - 26:14)
Center would be getting some new stuff (26:13 - 26:18)
and it's just a lot of wallets ties tie (26:14 - 26:22)
bars okay that was a little little (26:18 - 26:24)
disappointed oh it's also just winning (26:22 - 26:26)
of the bow ties the bow ties the bow (26:24 - 26:29)
ties are not real bow ties (26:26 - 26:32)
oh really the Crito they're very tiny (26:29 - 26:35)
clips which is like you give us look (26:32 - 26:38)
they know their actual tight eyes it's (26:35 - 26:40)
not that one of the what one of them (26:38 - 26:43)
could be an actual bowtie just one it's (26:40 - 26:46)
not that hard I did it for what seven (26:43 - 26:49)
people at your wedding Pokemon Center (26:46 - 26:52)
little disappointing not too much stuff (26:49 - 26:54)

of socks (26:54 - 26:57)

buy me Sh (26:57 - 27:02)
no they're whatever now brand the poke I (26:58 - 27:04)
don't think their socks are the best (27:02 - 27:07)
quality for 13 bucks yeah I mean there's (27:04 - 27:09)
a bunch of more ditto stuff but that was (27:07 - 27:11)
added kinda last week did um you I (27:09 - 27:14)
wonder if they had more planned I was (27:11 - 27:15)
actually expecting like more Galler (27:14 - 27:19)
plushies but nope well they did have (27:15 - 27:22)
free shipping so yeah well it's yeah but (27:19 - 27:24)
they always have 50 yeah that was that (27:22 - 27:26)
was a thing that's true they had free (27:24 - 27:28)
shipping on Pokemon Day but they always (27:26 - 27:33)
have free shipping or $50 or more and (27:28 - 27:36)
it's really easy to get to 50 bucks they (27:33 - 27:38)

something but anyways so they have their (31:43 - 31:49)
regular in-game outfits and then they (31:45 - 31:53)
have their Pokemon masters outfit which (31:49 - 31:55)
is called Cygnus suit and if they (31:53 - 31:57)
explained why they pick Cygnus it's (31:55 - 32:00)
somewhere I missed it but like at some (31:57 - 32:01)
point (32:00 - 32:03)
Brock changes outfits and he's I'm in my (32:01 - 32:06)
Cygnus suit this is my souped-up super (32:03 - 32:09)
powered outfit I'm more angry or excited (32:06 - 32:12)
or whatever in this outfit so it's (32:09 - 32:15)
basically their shorthand for not (32:12 - 32:18)
Holliday tied alternate clothing I'll (32:15 - 32:20)
put my comm real quick the hero of (32:18 - 32:22)
Pokemon Red and Blue is joining the (32:20 - 32:24)
playable cast of put my masters (32:22 - 32:26)
alongside his iconic partner Charizard (32:24 - 32:29)
the sync pair is just as powerful as you (32:26 - 32:30)
expect (32:29 - 32:32)
Charizard will mega evolve into mega (32:30 - 32:34)
Charizard X (32:32 - 32:37)
Plus Cygnus suit red and Charizard sync (32:34 - 32:39)
grid is already expanded so be sure to (32:37 - 32:41)
earn some orbs to make them more (32:39 - 32:45)
powerful you will be able to scout which (32:41 - 32:48)
is pull Cygnus suit red and Charizard (32:45 - 32:49)
for a limited time during the poky fair (32:48 - 32:53)
scout available March until March 15 so (32:49 - 32:55)
we have plenty of time we Greg and I (32:53 - 32:56)
were just talking during the break (32:55 - 32:58)
Steven stone is also available to the (32:56 - 33:00)
16th so if you haven't pulled Steven yet (32:58 - 33:03)
or you want to pull Steven you got (33:00 - 33:05)
plenty of time still and then they (33:03 - 33:08)
introduced the battle Villa which is a (33:05 - 33:12)
single-player gauntlet feature that (33:08 - 33:14)
allows many different sync pairs of (33:12 - 33:17)
shine each battle Villa challenge period (33:14 - 33:19)
lasts for two weeks each day you'll be (33:17 - 33:21)
able to create a team of nine sync pairs (33:19 - 33:22)
and see how far you can progress each (33:21 - 33:24)
battle will still be on the (33:22 - 33:26)
three-on-three format but HP MP and (33:24 - 33:28)
status conditions carry over for each (33:26 - 33:30)
battle oh that actually sounds cool yeah (33:28 - 33:36)
it's it's fun and surprisingly hard it's (33:30 - 33:39)
it's um this might be the first time (33:36 - 33:43)
Greg you said this is fun yeah it's so (33:39 - 33:45)
it's actually like a it's actually a (33:43 - 33:47)
puzzle you sort of have to look ahead (33:45 - 33:49)
and decide who am i bringing to her to (33:47 - 33:51)
get through the gauntlet when should I (33:49 - 33:54)
heal [ __ ] like at low levels is even use (33:51 - 33:56)
using my moves cuz you run out of PP (33:54 - 34:00)
like your speed ups your stat boosts if (33:56 - 34:03)
you use one of them they're gone so like (34:00 - 34:06)
if you blow it on the first run-through (34:03 - 34:08)
like I did you don't have them and the (34:06 - 34:11)
second one unless you spend items to get (34:08 - 34:13)
them back and those items don't come (34:11 - 34:17)
readily so the gameplay inside isn't (34:13 - 34:18)
that exciting is it still the same 3x3 (34:17 - 34:21)
battle but that extra sort of thought (34:18 - 34:24)
process is money and I get is actually (34:21 - 34:27)
it makes doing those battles a bit more (34:24 - 34:29)
exciting than I'm just gonna have to (34:27 - 34:31)
bowl this over because you do bowl over (34:29 - 34:34)
the lower levels but you still have to (34:31 - 34:36)
think about what you're doing because of (34:34 - 34:39)
the higher levels yet to come also if (34:36 - 34:41)
you are able you will earn lots of (34:39 - 34:42)
competition roars in the battle villa (34:41 - 34:44)
including a special items such as lucky (34:42 - 34:46)
cookies and lucky squirrels you can use (34:44 - 34:47)
these reward (34:46 - 34:49)
to give your sink pairs new (34:47 - 34:51)
compatibilities capabilities known as (34:49 - 34:53)
lucky skills at the end of the challenge (34:51 - 34:55)
period you will receive rewards (34:53 - 34:56)
corresponding to the number of battles (34:55 - 34:58)
you've cleared so try to get as far as (34:56 - 34:58)
you can (34:58 - 35:01)
they also added Valerie and sylveon (34:58 - 35:04)
which we talked about last week so you (35:01 - 35:07)
can now go up to chapter 24 Valerie (35:04 - 35:10)
isn't a pole Valerie is just reward you (35:07 - 35:11)
get for completing that chapter so (35:10 - 35:16)
please get up there for star I think I (35:11 - 35:19)
think she's three star okay because like (35:16 - 35:21)
that you get second fairy (35:19 - 35:25)
besides Greenville yep there is a sigma (35:21 - 35:28)
suit Eliza and Rotom which will be (35:25 - 35:30)
available like the same as red and (35:28 - 35:34)
Steven they can use X special attack to (35:30 - 35:37)
everyone they will also come with an (35:34 - 35:41)
expanded sync red like red and Charizard (35:37 - 35:43)
you can now evolve a bunch of Pokemon (35:41 - 35:46)
including Calum and s / Albert and (35:43 - 35:49)
Oshawa Blaine and the famous Blaine (35:46 - 35:52)
ponyta not what I think of when I think (35:49 - 35:53)
of Blaine but okay (35:52 - 35:56)
I just think of rapper - though so this (35:53 - 35:58)
makes a little bit more cash sure sure I (35:56 - 36:00)
think in pokemon stadium he had a rapid (35:58 - 36:02)
- but I feel like the TV show really hit (36:00 - 36:05)
home with that magmar yeah I mean okay (36:02 - 36:07)
hang you got that right everybody that (36:05 - 36:09)
you couldn't basically you couldn't (36:07 - 36:13)
evolve before you can now so my desk (36:09 - 36:15)
what's the middle one dusclops my desk (36:13 - 36:18)
ops is now finally a dusknoir that's not (36:15 - 36:19)
yeah yeah it was the very first one I (36:18 - 36:21)
did because I'm like I all the time I'm (36:19 - 36:24)
gonna need the ball so the shining star (36:21 - 36:29)
event a license Rotom her (36:24 - 36:33)
her solo challenge is also very (36:29 - 36:37)
interesting it's a whole map system so (36:33 - 36:39)
you move through things to get different (36:37 - 36:41)
rewards and you have to get up move (36:39 - 36:42)
tokens to be able to move through the (36:41 - 36:44)
maze again the gameplay in the actual (36:42 - 36:46)
game it's the same old gameplay but (36:44 - 36:49)
there's at least an extra element of (36:46 - 36:51)
okay I'm gonna think about how I want to (36:49 - 36:52)
move through this maze and what I want (36:51 - 36:55)
to pick up and do I want to use all of (36:52 - 36:57)
my moves on this one or do I just want (36:55 - 36:59)
to get to the end to get to the next (36:57 - 37:00)
thing that might have better rewards (36:59 - 37:03)
it's actually this I think this is the (37:00 - 37:06)
first time that they've really branched (37:03 - 37:10)
out to try a lot of very different (37:06 - 37:13)
things I think the battle Villa and (37:10 - 37:17)
Eliza's event are both very positive (37:13 - 37:21)
signs that they are willing to look at (37:17 - 37:23)
other games other things that work (37:21 - 37:25)
really well and figure out an (37:23 - 37:27)
intelligent way to work it into this (37:25 - 37:30)
system I still think there's too much (37:27 - 37:33)
low-level grinding but (37:30 - 37:36)
this is more of what I want from (37:33 - 37:39)
and game content like interesting (37:36 - 37:41)
challenges things that I that I want (37:39 - 37:44)
that are unique from each other like (37:41 - 37:46)
when this event goes away hopefully (37:44 - 37:48)
something better will replace it but (37:46 - 37:50)
that's different I think the problem (37:48 - 37:51)
with like the stephen stohn event and (37:50 - 37:54)
the mutual vent and the requires event (37:51 - 37:56)
is that the progression was exactly the (37:54 - 37:57)
same you went through a story and then (37:56 - 38:00)
you did the exact same co-op these feel (37:57 - 38:03)
very different and that makes the game a (38:00 - 38:06)
lot more exciting for the first time (38:03 - 38:08)
this weekend I'm like ooh I kind of want (38:06 - 38:10)
to jump into masters and says run (38:08 - 38:11)
through some of the new interesting (38:10 - 38:13)
stuff and I have not said that about (38:11 - 38:17)
this game until these hit so I think (38:13 - 38:20)
this is a very positive turning point (38:17 - 38:23)
for masters and I really hope that they (38:20 - 38:25)
continue experimenting this way and (38:23 - 38:30)
really trying a bunch of new ways to (38:25 - 38:34)
interact with their base gameplay now (38:30 - 38:35)
that we've seen the journey of Greg (38:34 - 38:39)
slowly start to change hey hey I caught (38:35 - 38:42)
Barry you catch him right yeah I caught (38:39 - 38:43)
a Barry you got it Barry (38:42 - 38:49)
yeah excuse me you owe me at million (38:43 - 38:51)
dollars yeah I did I caught him on the (38:49 - 38:52)
beach cuz he thought I was part of team (38:51 - 38:55)
break oh right yeah nicholae I'm not in (38:52 - 38:58)
my sync group which also is weird to me (38:55 - 39:02)
but okay but to commemorate Pokemon Day (38:58 - 39:04)
and poke my masters you will receive a (39:02 - 39:08)
one-time gift of 3000 gems which is 10 (39:04 - 39:11)
character poles if you log into the game (39:08 - 39:13)
at any time between March 15th you can (39:11 - 39:16)
also get the six month celebration login (39:13 - 39:18)
bonus which will give you another 3,000 (39:16 - 39:22)
gems by logging in for 14 times in the (39:18 - 39:26)
14 day period but because it's now it's (39:22 - 39:28)
a March 15 so you could like miss like (39:26 - 39:32)
four days and still be fine if you want (39:28 - 39:34)
to know how much 3000 gems in is in (39:32 - 39:37)
money it's about 25 bucks (39:34 - 39:40)
so just by logging in and collecting (39:37 - 39:42)
your Pokemon Day bonus you're getting (39:40 - 39:45)
what would I guess technically be $25 (39:42 - 39:48)
worth of in-game cursed currency to pull (39:45 - 39:50)
I mean in reality it's the (39:48 - 39:53)
dollars because you can't put a value on (39:50 - 39:56)
did mom man it's not like you there's a (39:53 - 39:58)
marketplace to like sell your expert (39:56 - 40:00)

Lobby more oh what really yeah good I (40:04 - 40:11)

wait so okay now let me just see if I (40:11 - 40:16)
can put this into terms I can understand (40:14 - 40:18)
I start up the game my ears explode (40:16 - 40:21)
because of the brass horns and then (40:18 - 40:23)
somebody is standing there yelling at me (40:21 - 40:25)
because I'm not playing enough so I can (40:23 - 40:26)
basically pick the person who's gonna (40:25 - 40:28)
yell at me for not playing enough yes (40:26 - 40:30)
like right now right is the one that (40:28 - 40:32)
quote-unquote yells at me which is just (40:30 - 40:34)
a whole bunch of dots and that is my (40:32 - 40:38)
ideal what greeting hey now I got a pole (40:34 - 40:40)

next to them when they show up at the (40:48 - 40:52)
top you'll see a little plus oh I see (40:49 - 40:55)
and then there's a heart up in the heart (40:52 - 40:58)
and they will show up more often so (40:55 - 41:00)
gardenia and rosary show up or often and (40:58 - 41:02)

interact with them and they'll give me (41:30 - 41:33)
things more often they'll show up more (41:31 - 41:35)

spoiler alert of hands in this Chandler (43:49 - 43:53)
spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler trailer (43:51 - 43:56)
is that a thing yeah just because it (43:53 - 43:59)
starts with a shiny Celebi it does yeah (43:56 - 44:03)
and so all I can think of is okay so (43:59 - 44:06)
this mythical is strong against psychic (44:03 - 44:11)
and so it's strong against Celebi like (44:06 - 44:14)
I'm like that has to be at least (44:11 - 44:16)
somewhat of a major plot point in the (44:14 - 44:20)
movie right like well if you so I okay (44:16 - 44:22)
so before we talk about the like there's (44:20 - 44:23)
a point I want to bring up in the (44:22 - 44:26)
trailer okay when I saw the rude I was (44:23 - 44:30)
like oh it looks like a Pokemon like I (44:26 - 44:33)
get it it doesn't scream like ultra (44:30 - 44:36)
beast or anything ah but I didn't love (44:33 - 44:38)
it and I don't know how you guys write (44:36 - 44:42)
about it I was fine with it it screams (44:38 - 44:47)
that sort of dark edgy Wolverine hero (44:42 - 44:49)
type thing which I don't really like (44:47 - 44:51)
that was so popular in the 90s what I (44:49 - 44:54)
got from it so I thought it was an (44:51 - 44:56)
interesting design but is it's not it's (44:54 - 45:00)
got that sort of Hot Topic II feel that (44:56 - 45:02)
I'm not a huge fan of yeah I guess you (45:00 - 45:04)
could say genesect maybe has that feel (45:02 - 45:07)
or Darkrai maybe has that feel like it's (45:04 - 45:11)
not it's not an unusual mythical there's (45:07 - 45:12)
like always two times of mythical (45:11 - 45:14)
there's like you're edgier where I haz (45:12 - 45:17)
has a very strong theme right dark right (45:14 - 45:20)
is a shadow it really fits that theme (45:17 - 45:24)
and it's hard to say what this (45:20 - 45:28)
theme is it's like as definitely well Oh (45:24 - 45:29)
Tarzan (45:28 - 45:34)
it's Tarzan British yeah UK noble that (45:29 - 45:35)
raised in the jungle I mean that's what (45:34 - 45:37)
the whole height what the pre-code movie (45:35 - 45:40)
is I want my menticles to be cute period (45:37 - 45:44)
I don't well I don't want these grumpy (45:40 - 45:45)
mythical z' (45:44 - 45:48)

victini's I want Muse the ANC's little (45:48 - 45:55)
hoopa's McGee Rinna's Mar shadows I want (45:52 - 45:57)
to give them hugs I wanna Shaymin I'll (45:55 - 46:00)
take the regular Shaymin keldeo even I (45:57 - 46:02)
don't want these grouchy mythical z' (46:00 - 46:04)
yeah but that mask is gonna be real (46:02 - 46:08)
popular Halloween at butterfly face no (46:04 - 46:13)
yeah Oh bang yeah I wasn't I wasn't too (46:08 - 46:15)
hot on it and I eat I mean I was I also (46:13 - 46:18)
was it too hot on Zahra Ora once again (46:15 - 46:20)
not a cutie but I I'm a huge fan of (46:18 - 46:23)
Darkrai and I really liked genesect a (46:20 - 46:26)
lot you oh you like dark ride because of (46:23 - 46:28)
the movie Dada (46:26 - 46:31)
exactly I'm sick like I mean after (46:28 - 46:33)
episode 400 you're not allowed to say (46:31 - 46:36)
that anymore i watch you you were right (46:33 - 46:37)
in the fact that movies have definitely (46:36 - 46:39)
influenced my opinion on Pokemon because (46:37 - 46:41)
I thought volcania and was really cool (46:39 - 46:43)
until I saw that movie and I was like (46:41 - 46:50)
you know what punk volcano's not your (46:43 - 46:54)
friend no more the trailer which you can (46:50 - 46:58)
search for official trailer movie (46:54 - 47:02)
Pokemon movie 23 Coco so is rude a color (46:58 - 47:05)
that we don't know like that magenta (47:02 - 47:10)
right yes this is rude is rude like (47:05 - 47:13)
green is there a green color that's rude (47:10 - 47:17)
because it does fit like it wasn't a (47:13 - 47:18)
surprise that it was grass because (47:17 - 47:20)
that's they did the they did the three (47:18 - 47:23)
colors the primary colors red blue and (47:20 - 47:26)
now green that made total sense I going (47:23 - 47:29)
in knew it was gonna be grass I was just (47:26 - 47:30)
confused by the name I mean I think (47:29 - 47:33)
they're just saying he's a rude boy is (47:30 - 47:35)
that it like just know about the color (47:33 - 47:38)
scheme (47:35 - 47:38)
Zaa is something in japanese that (47:38 - 47:51)
eventually equals monkey like I think (47:42 - 47:52)
it's a monkey (47:51 - 47:56)
I think it's like Saru is is what the (47:52 - 47:59)
like za is I guess we would have to ask (47:56 - 48:02)
Andrew but I'm only yeah I only get the (47:59 - 48:03)
rude part of its name (48:02 - 48:07)
I've seen people say that it has a lot (48:03 - 48:08)
of characteristics and I kind of agree (48:07 - 48:12)
with them with specifically GRU key and (48:08 - 48:15)
thwack II yes I mean this is we've had (48:12 - 48:17)
this conversation a million times (48:15 - 48:19)
there's plenty of Pokemon that look like (48:17 - 48:22)
other Pokemon uh-huh ruphylin and tauros (48:19 - 48:25)
miltank and tauros Luvdisc (48:22 - 48:29)
and that bad bigger fish mo mo mo mo mo (48:25 - 48:31)
mo mo (48:29 - 48:34)
that one yes like in the in the lore of (48:31 - 48:37)
Pokemon that that doesn't ever surprise (48:34 - 48:39)
me when a Pokemon looks slightly like (48:37 - 48:43)
another Pokemon I wonder if there could (48:39 - 48:45)
be two other mythical z' I'd be really (48:43 - 48:48)
interested if one was a rabbit and the (48:45 - 48:51)
other one was a lizard and you're a (48:48 - 48:52)
visionary (48:51 - 48:57)
well sob sob will not a lizard oh wow (48:52 - 49:01)
kinda yeah most because not only is za (48:57 - 49:04)
rude another monkey and we have a lot of (49:01 - 49:06)
monkey Pokemon there's a lot of monkeys (49:04 - 49:09)
in the in the world yeah but will that (49:06 - 49:11)
accept this there's no no I'm not (49:09 - 49:14)
complaining over a billion we got a (49:11 - 49:17)
starter monkey that was grass and now we (49:14 - 49:19)
have a mythical monkey that is grass and (49:17 - 49:22)
I'm here and we know that there's at (49:19 - 49:25)
least one more mythical and we know that (49:22 - 49:28)
there might be another mythical that (49:25 - 49:31)
might be like the cute mythical the like (49:28 - 49:36)
the Celebi or the MU or the drive the (49:31 - 49:39)
cute mythical I need it I mean this is (49:36 - 49:43)
cute in its only yeah so I am I warmed (49:39 - 49:45)
up to the rude more when I saw the (49:43 - 49:47)
trailer okay so this is the fan in the (49:45 - 49:49)
trailer that's that's kind of important (49:47 - 49:52)
ah it's an easy sell for me you put a (49:49 - 49:56)
cape on any Pokemon I'm buying in okay (49:52 - 49:58)
but you don't like superheroes I don't (49:56 - 50:00)
but like a Pokemon wearing a cape is is (49:58 - 50:02)
very adorable (50:00 - 50:06)
I don't it's like when Pikachu puts a (50:02 - 50:08)
hat on or like when Pikachu's holding a (50:06 - 50:09)
ketchup bottle there's like something (50:08 - 50:12)
about hey hey hey don't bring in the (50:09 - 50:15)
ketchup bottle like whoa no no movies (50:12 - 50:18)
capes none but there's like something (50:15 - 50:22)
about I don't know like a Pokemon (50:18 - 50:24)
wearing something that I meant you look (50:22 - 50:26)
the reason that literally the reason (50:24 - 50:29)
that licky licky is so good in the Darr (50:26 - 50:31)
crime movie is it because it had that (50:29 - 50:34)
dumb sash across it because it's that (50:31 - 50:36)
one deer that turns into the lake you (50:34 - 50:38)
lucky (50:36 - 50:41)
didn't have the sash he has the sash so (50:38 - 50:45)
okay so okay whatever the girl if you (50:41 - 50:46)
watch the trailer as the rude is wearing (50:45 - 50:48)
a cape which I think does add more (50:46 - 50:51)
personality to it specifically of the (50:48 - 50:53)
Kapus pink and specifically the Cape has (50:51 - 50:55)
the numbers 251 on it (50:53 - 50:58)
which is not only Celebes number but (50:55 - 51:00)
that's the same pink that shiny Celebi (50:58 - 51:02)
is yeah (51:00 - 51:06)
also Mojo Jojo from Power Puff Girls (51:02 - 51:08)
wears a similar cape so make your own (51:06 - 51:10)
judgement there's a whole power there's (51:08 - 51:13)
a whole Powerpuff Girls thing like you (51:10 - 51:15)
look it up on the Internet it's kind of (51:13 - 51:18)
funny look at that there's a crane rant (51:15 - 51:21)
in this movie so I'm soldiers and yeah I (51:18 - 51:23)
saw that at the end of the trailer as (51:21 - 51:26)
Pikachu and at the end of the trailer is (51:23 - 51:27)
that rude is sitting in the hot spring (51:26 - 51:30)
and that is also very cute because (51:27 - 51:32)
that's what the monkeys in Japan do I (51:30 - 51:33)
saw it on TV (51:32 - 51:36)
I played mom I did know they come down (51:33 - 51:38)
from the mountain the monkeys in Japan (51:36 - 51:39)
they come down and they sit in the hot (51:38 - 51:40)
spring and then you can go to the park (51:39 - 51:43)
and visit them and they're protected (51:40 - 51:45)
it's real cute for me the movie trailer (51:43 - 51:48)
made me warm up to zerud a lot more than (51:45 - 51:53)
just the the initial screenshot I can't (51:48 - 51:56)
say that the shiny Celebi or the root (51:53 - 51:57)
itself has made me excited for that (51:56 - 51:59)
movie but you put a cream ran in I'm (51:57 - 52:00)
sold (51:59 - 52:03)
I'm also not huge on tart like I never (52:00 - 52:06)
liked Tarzan as kid I don't really like (52:03 - 52:09)
that yeah well there's no I mean there's (52:06 - 52:14)
very Maddox is a classic story it is a (52:09 - 52:18)
problematic story just say the least but (52:14 - 52:20)
it is a classic it's a necessary the (52:18 - 52:22)
other thing is like we already had this (52:20 - 52:26)
with the Kangaskhan kid so I'm not like (52:22 - 52:28)
thrilled that we're revisiting that (52:26 - 52:32)
again how does Tarzan and girl comes (52:28 - 52:36)
finds Tarzan they get married here Jane (52:32 - 52:39)
thank you okay it depends on which (52:36 - 52:40)
version you're what like the standard (52:39 - 52:43)
one he returns and is civilized back (52:40 - 52:47)
into society somewhat it's yeah there's (52:43 - 52:47)
a (52:47 - 52:49)
danger of somebody trying to capture the (52:47 - 52:51)
root and ask you know they're destroying (52:49 - 52:53)
the forest didn't you notice the trees (52:51 - 52:55)
were falling down did you pay attention (52:53 - 52:56)
to this trailer at all (52:55 - 52:58)
no no well yeah I did there's a crane (52:56 - 53:02)
ran in it I'm in I'm already sold I just (52:58 - 53:04)
like sooner like that I'm excited for (53:02 - 53:06)
the movie but the general theme of the (53:04 - 53:09)
movie just seems very not exciting yeah (53:06 - 53:11)
but you know hey it's gonna be awesome (53:09 - 53:13)
hopefully in the power we had the power (53:11 - 53:17)
of us and I choose you so it nowhere to (53:13 - 53:17)
go but up (53:17 - 53:24)
well hmm yike yeah I would put I choose (53:17 - 53:26)
ease significantly higher than the (53:24 - 53:28)
Vulcanian movie yeah but that's not been (53:26 - 53:31)
the best huh that's a a while ago I've (53:28 - 53:33)
known about the last two films yeah it (53:31 - 53:35)
looks like it's just a chigan and (53:33 - 53:38)
partners but okay does this mean the (53:35 - 53:41)
team rocket has Cameron is that what (53:38 - 53:41)
we're getting here (53:41 - 53:43)
I'm they it looks like they're stealing (53:41 - 53:46)
or trying to steal cram rant and the (53:43 - 53:48)
Kramer and it looks so dumb that it (53:46 - 53:50)
doesn't know what's happening which (53:48 - 53:54)
that's me yeah like your shines kiss (53:50 - 53:56)
moment right there yes I'm worried that (53:54 - 53:58)
the crime rate jokes are given the same (53:56 - 54:01)
as SciTech jokes no no no no no no (53:58 - 54:06)
if Kramer ant should be the munchlax of (54:01 - 54:09)
this movie cuz munchlax was the best (54:06 - 54:12)
part of Destiny d-axis because it was (54:09 - 54:15)
like munchlax head the through line and (54:12 - 54:17)
it was its own like good story going (54:15 - 54:20)
through isn't that much less on the (54:17 - 54:22)
doughnut machine of the hot dog machine (54:20 - 54:27)
yeah yeah yeah like trash cans it's (54:22 - 54:29)
great Wow it's it's real good (54:27 - 54:34)
as long as cram rant is gargling Pikachu (54:29 - 54:37)
I'm there yeah I mean if we walk away (54:34 - 54:40)
from this movie with with a bad story of (54:37 - 54:42)
Tarzan but good crime rant moments that (54:40 - 54:45)
will be better than 90% of Pokemon (54:42 - 54:50)

anywhere on the johto list you all (60:26 - 60:32)
failed me sure there is nothing (60:28 - 60:36)
surprising about this list of me what (60:32 - 60:38)
about you guys I mean I was surprised (60:36 - 60:40)
about nights where I said who'd number (60:38 - 60:42)
one actually was cuz I was sure it was (60:40 - 60:45)
gonna be Charizard oh okay (60:42 - 60:48)
spoiler wasn't charizard charizard (60:45 - 60:54)
alright number five Umbreon like why no (60:48 - 60:56)
I know I don't know now props (60:54 - 60:58)
I think I'm Breanna is a beautiful spelt (60:56 - 61:05)
eeveelution in your opinion no there's a (60:58 - 61:10)
lot more okay everyone who loves Umbria (61:05 - 61:13)
let me let me I'm sorry I'm gonna break (61:10 - 61:15)
down the Umbreon crowd okay cuz I made (61:13 - 61:17)
the Umbreon crowd yeah they were all (61:15 - 61:20)
edge lords and middle school and cool (61:17 - 61:23)
silver came out you you were an edge (61:20 - 61:25)
large in middle school so why are you (61:23 - 61:28)
not an idiot and uh cuz your your choice (61:25 - 61:31)
at the time was you were you were either (61:28 - 61:33)
so committed to Eevee that Umbreon was (61:31 - 61:36)
the natural progression right hey and (61:33 - 61:38)
I'm not disagreeing I'm Briana (61:36 - 61:40)
significantly better than Jolteon flare (61:38 - 61:43)
and Vaporeon or you went the other edge (61:40 - 61:45)
Lord route and you gravitated towards (61:43 - 61:48)
hound hour and hound ooh oh yeah cuz (61:45 - 61:51)
they got skills right and I ended up in (61:48 - 61:57)
the Hound our houndoom camp look I was a (61:51 - 62:01)
very troubled child I can't even say the (61:57 - 62:03)
gen waters came out for us so Charizard (62:01 - 62:07)
number four me me queue number three (62:03 - 62:11)
heck yeah heck yeah I'm here for it (62:07 - 62:14)
number two is the worst number two hurts (62:11 - 62:18)
my soul number two is Lucario know (62:14 - 62:23)
that's why shrieking I I blame that on (62:18 - 62:24)
the Europeans (62:23 - 62:29)
no this is absolutely mmm it is get (62:24 - 62:32)
together Europe it is surprising to me (62:29 - 62:38)
that Lucario got more votes than (62:32 - 62:39)
Charizard (62:38 - 62:43)
I would I would argue that they really (62:39 - 62:46)
struggled with Gen 3 and trying to push (62:43 - 62:49)
a Pokemon that people can gravitate (62:46 - 62:52)
towards like Charizard they didn't (62:49 - 62:55)
really even have one for Jen - you could (62:52 - 62:57)
argue that it was like the eb evolutions (62:55 - 63:01)
i mean i will say that i mean if you (62:57 - 63:06)
look at the votes gen 3 did very well (63:01 - 63:09)
I mean gen 3 is expected is exactly what (63:06 - 63:12)
I expected through 2p I'm sure if you (63:09 - 63:16)
rewound the podcast to 7 weeks ago I (63:12 - 63:19)
think we said like either SBN or Umbreon (63:16 - 63:22)
is breadwinning Johto Kantos when it (63:19 - 63:23)
Charizard when in Kanto and that (63:22 - 63:25)
Rayquaza is going to ruin twin Hoenn and (63:23 - 63:28)
that's what happened well we knew that (63:25 - 63:30)
and then it's not surprising to me that (63:28 - 63:32)
Lucario once in oh that's what I (63:30 - 63:36)
expected yes Gen 5 is like the only (63:32 - 63:39)
thing that like blew me away here I will (63:36 - 63:42)
argue that gen fine gen 5 had the worst (63:39 - 63:47)
showing of all the gens see the problem (63:42 - 63:48)
is all the Jenna 5 Pokemon are so (63:47 - 63:51)
wonderful it's just hard to pick one (63:48 - 63:53)
that stands out above I mean so so much (63:51 - 63:55)
excellent and so that that's sarcasm but (63:53 - 63:58)
I I think there's some truth from Mari (63:55 - 63:59)
Anderson you think any praise of Gen 5 (63:58 - 64:02)
is sarcasm but then how have we been (63:59 - 64:03)
doing this program together for eight (64:02 - 64:09)
years okay Lucario yeah because the card (64:03 - 64:10)
there's a whole wrench and everything (64:09 - 64:13)
the the gen 3 fanbase for what we're (64:10 - 64:15)
very vocal for their remix they won (64:13 - 64:16)
their horn that's them (64:15 - 64:18)
they invert very and they they were very (64:16 - 64:21)
happy and then they instantly shut up (64:18 - 64:24)
whereas we got what we want whereas like (64:21 - 64:27)
the the johto fanboys will never shut up (64:24 - 64:30)
they got a completa you know that that (64:27 - 64:32)
heartgold SoulSilver is their favorite (64:30 - 64:33)
game in the entire universe and blah (64:32 - 64:34)
blah blah (64:33 - 64:36)
- rooster (64:34 - 64:40)
and they book like we like the the johto (64:36 - 64:42)
fans will they'll never shut up (64:40 - 64:45)
no the hoenn fans they they got their (64:42 - 64:48)
game they were happy they learn they (64:45 - 64:49)
love their starters and they love their (64:48 - 64:50)
legendaries it's really the only thing (64:49 - 64:53)
that gen3 has to offer Jen winners have (64:50 - 64:54)
the worst and they never showed up (64:53 - 64:55)
either (64:54 - 64:58)
and then the cinah fans are now at the (64:55 - 65:01)
age where they have become I I would (64:58 - 65:06)
argue as bad as Jen winners we're like (65:01 - 65:09)
you they're there because Senna was (65:06 - 65:12)
their first Pokemon game because Lucario (65:09 - 65:16)
is their Charizard that they think that (65:12 - 65:19)
their region and their game was perfect (65:16 - 65:26)
and Sinnoh is far from perfect but yeah (65:19 - 65:28)
right like somebody like you me know (65:26 - 65:30)
you'll meet a gen winner and they'll say (65:28 - 65:32)
like oh you know Pokemon got bad after (65:30 - 65:36)
150 the Kanto is the best region most (65:32 - 65:39)
memorable 51 Thank You 151 yeah that now (65:36 - 65:44)
that mindset like exists for people for (65:39 - 65:47)
sin oh and I would expect the same thing (65:44 - 65:50)
if we were to get to know remakes this (65:47 - 65:53)
fanbase will not shut up they will know (65:50 - 65:56)
they will continue on so as much as I (65:53 - 65:58)
don't me are getting those remakes you (65:56 - 66:00)
know we're getting me yeah sure I mean (65:58 - 66:03)
they love money it'd be silly not yeah (66:00 - 66:05)
absolutely they love money if there's (66:03 - 66:07)
one thing about the gen 3 fans not my (66:05 - 66:11)
favorite region but they were very happy (66:07 - 66:14)
with their remade region and they went (66:11 - 66:17)
back to doing their thing we are an easy (66:14 - 66:21)
to please happy group who don't harp on (66:17 - 66:24)
things unlike the rest of all yo we know (66:21 - 66:27)
the perfection of our region we got it (66:24 - 66:29)
we're happy with it if you can't see it (66:27 - 66:33)
that's on you and number one with a (66:29 - 66:38)
bullet greninja I was somewhat surprised (66:33 - 66:40)
I mean I'm not surprised because the (66:38 - 66:45)
anime I guess I really thought (66:40 - 66:47)
that Charizard in Virginia would have (66:45 - 66:51)
been reversed in the sanding I would (66:47 - 66:52)
have probably said greninja was top (66:51 - 66:55)
three yeah and I would have probably (66:52 - 66:57)
said Lucario top five I would have (66:55 - 67:01)
actually put maybe Eevee or Mewtwo at (66:57 - 67:05)
number one because Eevee fanboys are (67:01 - 67:08)
everywhere everywhere Eevee fan people (67:05 - 67:12)
thank you Eevee fan folks I'm the app (67:08 - 67:14)
Mewtwo not being a lot higher as (67:12 - 67:17)
surprising since Mewtwo's is very very (67:14 - 67:19)
dominant in Japan having so much (67:17 - 67:23)
Charizard I don't know Benja no greninja (67:19 - 67:28)
ogre ninja does the thing that (67:23 - 67:31)
appeals to a lot of people they they (67:28 - 67:36)
they combined Pokemon and Naruto (67:31 - 67:42)
together now they just need to what's (67:36 - 67:44)
one piece pirates they just need to find (67:42 - 67:47)
some pirate in two straw hat Pikachu (67:44 - 67:49)
yeah but they gotta apply that to a (67:47 - 67:51)
Pokemon to carry going to success (67:49 - 67:54)
because one piece is very popular I mean (67:51 - 67:56)
they just maybe that's what the root is (67:54 - 67:58)
it's got the gum gum fruit makes its arm (67:56 - 68:05)
stretch I don't know what okay so you (67:58 - 68:12)
said gum gum fruit and I think in (68:05 - 68:13)
retrospect greninja is not surprising (68:12 - 68:16)
because I if you if you were to look at (68:13 - 68:19)
least at the anime series yeah I would (68:16 - 68:21)
argue that people were upset that Ash (68:19 - 68:24)
lost because the relationship between (68:21 - 68:26)
ash and greninja was probably the best (68:24 - 68:28)
relationship they wrote I would agree (68:26 - 68:31)
it's second to like ash and Charizard or (68:28 - 68:33)
I guess like but I mean beside that I (68:31 - 68:35)
should Pikachu that I don't think that (68:33 - 68:38)
that's a fair comparison but and that's (68:35 - 68:40)
probably why sceptile is a lot higher (68:38 - 68:42)
than some other Pokemon is because of (68:40 - 68:45)
Ash's sceptile yeah I mean definitely (68:42 - 68:48)
the anime has changed and definitely (68:45 - 68:51)
influenced where we add all surprised by (68:48 - 68:52)
who wouldn't Galler (68:51 - 68:55)
okay let's let's go through all let's go (68:52 - 68:56)
through top ten for each real quick and (68:55 - 68:58)
I think the first couple are not (68:56 - 69:01)
surprising here so Kanto is coming in at (68:58 - 69:05)
number ten is Lapras nine arcanine 8 mu (69:01 - 69:09)
2 7 mu 6 Dragon Knight 5 Eevee or (69:05 - 69:13)
Pikachu 3 Bulbasaur to Gengar and 1 (69:09 - 69:17)
Charizard oddly enough when people were (69:13 - 69:18)
complaining about the national dex they (69:17 - 69:21)
ran their reddit pole and Charizard came (69:18 - 69:26)
in number one ironic that the Pokemon (69:21 - 69:27)
company wouldn't want to cut the number (69:26 - 69:31)
one Pokemon from their games and Gengar (69:27 - 69:34)
was also I want to say very very high as (69:31 - 69:37)
well as arcanine very very high on those (69:34 - 69:39)
polls yeah I don't think there's any (69:37 - 69:42)
surprises here with that top 10 I would (69:39 - 69:43)
probably maybe saw Snorlax in the top 10 (69:42 - 69:47)
it shied out here at 11:11 but like (69:43 - 69:49)
literally I don't think there was any (69:47 - 69:51)
any surprises with that list (69:49 - 69:53)
I mean I'm mad that cubone is on the (69:51 - 69:56)
list but whatever ya know mr. mime (69:53 - 70:00)
cubone was robbed okay fo robbed Joe (69:56 - 70:02)
talked about the crime that is Joe - (70:00 - 70:05)
yeah that's farce isn't on this list at (70:02 - 70:07)
all and I'm very mad at everybody I gave (70:05 - 70:11)
you very explicit instructions and none (70:07 - 70:14)
of you followed through you know there's (70:11 - 70:17)
no cool fish on here either well cuz (70:14 - 70:19)
qwilfish is terrible alright number 10 (70:17 - 70:23)
Totodile so we [ __ ] cyndaquil Espeon (70:19 - 70:26)
which I thought was a little low eevee (70:23 - 70:29)
eevee people maybe you know split on (70:26 - 70:34)
this Ampharos scizor Typhlosion lugia (70:29 - 70:36)
Tyranitar Umbreon there's no surprise (70:34 - 70:40)
with that top three at all nope yeah (70:36 - 70:43)
that's very straightforward (70:40 - 70:43)
hoenn a little shocked that absol my top (70:43 - 70:49)
10 actually (70:48 - 70:53)
oh absolutely popular but I was (70:49 - 70:57)
surprised that it that it I expected my (70:53 - 71:00)
while to be higher because of its you (70:57 - 71:04)
like people use it all the time so I was (71:00 - 71:07)
surprised that that was way down in 18 (71:04 - 71:11)
at least Sableye Maitlis so I'm fine can (71:07 - 71:13)
we tell the weirdest part of this list (71:11 - 71:17)
is Iran at 13 this is mind-blowing to me (71:13 - 71:20)
yeah yeah well Aaron and egg run 13 and (71:17 - 71:25)
14 yeah like I don't know why that's so (71:20 - 71:29)
weird to me also hold on let's back up (71:25 - 71:33)
not too came in at 18 for Johto excuse (71:29 - 71:36)
me not you ready because they're cute (71:33 - 71:39)
look at your edge lord houndoom was (71:36 - 71:42)
beaten up by look you had slim pickings (71:39 - 71:45)
in Johto I understand but boy I mean (71:42 - 71:47)
Wooper at least made the list okay (71:45 - 71:50)
coming in at number 10 absol Milotic (71:47 - 71:54)
Jirachi Metagross mudkip Blaziken (71:50 - 72:00)
sceptile Flygon Gardevoir and Rayquaza I (71:54 - 72:03)
thought Metagross would have been higher (72:00 - 72:06)
really I did think yeah this would have (72:03 - 72:08)
been higher than Flygon I I agree I (72:06 - 72:10)
would put my two girls over Flygon in (72:08 - 72:12)
what I thought better (72:10 - 72:14)
Gardevoir position doesn't surprise me (72:12 - 72:16)
garter bar is amazing now the same (72:14 - 72:18)
people who voted for Gardevoir voted for (72:16 - 72:20)
Lucario a hundred percent not a doubt in (72:18 - 72:22)
my mind Road (72:20 - 72:30)
I did not I voted for sample I positive (72:22 - 72:36)
moment Lucario ah sin Oh your top ten (72:30 - 72:40)
Giratina Empoleon Arceus Glaceon Darkrai (72:36 - 72:44)
Infernape Piplup luxray Garchomp (72:40 - 72:47)
and then Lucario can we just finally say (72:44 - 72:51)
that Turtwig is the bad starter of Senna (72:47 - 72:54)
yes since the other ones were all the (72:51 - 72:58)
top ten and Turtwig is way down in 21 (72:54 - 73:01)
anyone who voted for lopunny also (72:58 - 73:03)
probably voted for Gardevoir and Lucario (73:01 - 73:05)
I'm just putting that out there love (73:03 - 73:07)
when he came in at 19 (73:05 - 73:12)
Bidoof who I you put Bidoof at 20 and (73:07 - 73:15)
you didn't put Dunsparce anywhere on the (73:12 - 73:17)
little boob is a thousand times better (73:15 - 73:21)
than Dunsparce get a dose of reality is (73:17 - 73:27)
at 20 and rose raids at 26 excuse me the (73:21 - 73:29)
only shocker here for me is ro Tom's not (73:27 - 73:32)
top ten I don't think people like base (73:29 - 73:34)
Rotom though I think they like the forms (73:32 - 73:39)
and the form of didn't happen until what (73:34 - 73:44)
gen-y they happened in four no I don't (73:39 - 73:47)
think it's weird mention most misdreavus (73:44 - 73:49)
and miss Maggie is made top thirty and (73:47 - 73:50)
rid of their respective things which is (73:49 - 73:54)
like slightly weird to me because I feel (73:50 - 73:56)
like no one ever talks about those (73:54 - 73:57)
Pokemon or ever brings those Pokemon I (73:56 - 74:02)
think their wishes and this was a (73:57 - 74:04)
worldwide vote and you keep thinking of (74:02 - 74:07)
like us people I mean like in incredibly (74:04 - 74:10)
unpopular or incredibly popular in China (74:07 - 74:12)
or something well I don't I don't think (74:10 - 74:14)
there were a lot to vote because they (74:12 - 74:16)
don't have Google in China that's not a (74:14 - 74:17)
hundred percent sure if there's ways (74:16 - 74:20)
around that are you sure there is like I (74:17 - 74:22)
do like I if those like a Japanese only (74:20 - 74:24)
list I guarantee you sternal X would (74:22 - 74:26)
have been top five like and if this was (74:24 - 74:29)
an American only list I guarantee you (74:26 - 74:30)
like Snorlax would have been top five (74:29 - 74:32)
like I I do know the difference between (74:30 - 74:34)
like I dunno what's popular in Japan (74:32 - 74:36)

two biggest markets voting yeah another (74:37 - 74:44)

Chandeleur it's easily one of my (76:34 - 76:38)
favorite Pokemon I did not expect it to (76:35 - 76:39)
come in number one I think I actually (76:38 - 76:42)
voted for it for Gen 5 so your vote (76:39 - 76:45)
swayed the decision right there and I (76:42 - 76:47)
would have spent expected either zoroark (76:45 - 76:50)
or like Keldeo to have won this and (76:47 - 76:53)
kellyo is not even top 10 or Victini I (76:50 - 76:56)
could have seen but (76:53 - 76:56)

a Victini of the list (77:00 - 77:03)

greninja hi-yah I thought maybe Esper (77:22 - 77:28)
would have been a little bit higher (77:27 - 77:31)
because I felt like Esper was the talk (77:28 - 77:32)
of the town when I came first came out (77:31 - 77:36)

evolution that made it Breck should just (78:39 - 78:43)

Drago Pulte number 1 yeah there you go (80:55 - 81:02)
I have one thing to say about Ice Cube (81:00 - 81:04)
that you view now reminded me just a (81:02 - 81:07)
quick aside (81:04 - 81:10)
back in the pokemon black and white days (81:07 - 81:11)
I don't remember if they carried this (81:10 - 81:14)
forward for x and y but when you played (81:11 - 81:16)
black and white if you battled every (81:14 - 81:19)
trainer in that game you saw every (81:16 - 81:20)
single Pokemon whether it was in your (81:19 - 81:23)
game or not in your game I realized (81:20 - 81:25)
today that I play through sword you know (81:23 - 81:28)
I talked to every trainer I battle every (81:25 - 81:30)
trainer in the game I never saw ice QE (81:28 - 81:36)
even once is Melanie's Pokemon yeah I (81:30 - 81:37)
mean that's why I'm just saying this (81:36 - 81:39)
like you you don't even get to see it (81:37 - 81:42)
yes I have it as seen in your pokedex in (81:39 - 81:46)
sword yeah I know you did in black and (81:42 - 81:49)
white I don't know if that's like a huge (81:46 - 81:53)
issue for me oh it is because if I (81:49 - 81:55)
wasn't talking to people I wouldn't even (81:53 - 81:56)
know that Pokemon existed gonna be like (81:55 - 82:00)
scratching I didn't go out of discovery (81:56 - 82:03)
you're not one of those people that sit (82:00 - 82:05)
on the route and keep seeing if you (82:03 - 82:07)
caught everything but I could sit there (82:05 - 82:09)
for the rest of my life and never have (82:07 - 82:11)
come across a nice queue it's not in my (82:09 - 82:15)
game oh that's true yeah I don't I've (82:11 - 82:16)
I've only the only time I've seen like (82:15 - 82:18)
two star owners is like somebody hosting (82:16 - 82:20)
a stone journal raid that I joined (82:18 - 82:22)
there's your gallery Pokemon uh isn't (82:20 - 82:25)
where the Korver nights so hi (82:22 - 82:29)
no it's cool all right it's like they (82:25 - 82:33)
finally got Skarmory right (82:29 - 82:33)
yeah Crim's Grimm snarls not actually (82:33 - 82:38)
surprising to me that's a pretty cool (82:36 - 82:40)
pokémon (82:38 - 82:42)
well the Giganta max version the res (82:40 - 82:46)
version the regular version no flap Oh (82:42 - 82:48)
chicken fish flap will didn't make the (82:46 - 82:50)
list but Appleton did I'm mad about that (82:48 - 82:53)
yeah that's just people who like ugly (82:50 - 82:56)
things that's what you guys hating on (82:53 - 82:57)
pie (82:56 - 83:00)
I like pie I don't like Appleton does (82:57 - 83:02)
not surprise me (83:00 - 83:03)
I actually thought sind race is gonna be (83:02 - 83:08)
number one here cinder H a yes and (83:03 - 83:10)
garage I am not surprised that toxicity (83:08 - 83:13)
came in at number two I'm not either (83:10 - 83:15)
you got your hot topics playing its (83:13 - 83:18)
guitar chest and yeah wow smoking cigs (83:15 - 83:21)
in the corner voting on Umbreon and (83:18 - 83:24)
toxicity I'm sure I wanted like that's (83:21 - 83:25)
the thing I'm more interested just happy (83:24 - 83:28)
that snom is for I need the Venn diagram (83:25 - 83:32)
of who's voting for Pokemon we need hey (83:28 - 83:34)
Pokemon company give us give us this (83:32 - 83:36)
bridge yes wait a moria data because you (83:34 - 83:38)
know people was just collecting this (83:36 - 83:39)
data and putting it with all of your (83:38 - 83:42)
purchasing and response and all about (83:39 - 83:43)
share and now they know everything about (83:42 - 83:47)
everything but if they were ever to do (83:43 - 83:50)
this again I mean these these this is (83:47 - 83:52)
why I like this list was not like (83:50 - 83:57)
surprising to an extent because it's (83:52 - 84:00)
almost always the same Pokemon like it's (83:57 - 84:02)
always gonna be Charizard for Kanto it's (84:00 - 84:04)
always gonna be Lucario for sin now (84:02 - 84:06)
Shanna okay all of you Nova is a huge (84:04 - 84:10)
mystery still and I don't know if the (84:06 - 84:11)
people who started with you know of what (84:10 - 84:13)
what age would they be right now like 21 (84:11 - 84:17)
if they were eight in what 2010 yeah (84:13 - 84:22)
they'd be 18 to 20 yeah and they're yeah (84:17 - 84:24)
I don't know where they would be out in (84:22 - 84:27)
life I don't think they know where (84:24 - 84:28)
they're at in life I'm sure that's true (84:27 - 84:31)
but like as much as I was like saying (84:28 - 84:34)
that people who voted for Lucario voted (84:31 - 84:36)
for Gardevoir and for lopunny and for (84:34 - 84:38)
talks not text zero or a like I do (84:36 - 84:40)
strongly believe that that there's a (84:38 - 84:43)
theme between those Pokemon and a (84:40 - 84:46)
specific type of person and there's (84:43 - 84:48)
nothing wrong with it like likes the (84:46 - 84:51)
bipedal two-legged Pokemon (84:48 - 84:54)
anthropomorphic and that doesn't like (84:51 - 84:57)
have like cinder a swath away from the (84:54 - 84:59)
gen8 starters as being the dominant (84:57 - 85:01)
starter I mean you could even make that (84:59 - 85:04)
same argument for greninja of like it is (85:01 - 85:08)
more anthropomorphic yeah open more FAQ (85:04 - 85:11)
but all of the starters in gen (85:08 - 85:14)
in the current 10 went that route yeah (85:11 - 85:17)
went that route yeah like I mean are you (85:14 - 85:20)
just saying saying people only vote of (85:17 - 85:23)
them because they walk on two legs no is (85:20 - 85:26)
that your main point yes possibly (85:23 - 85:30)
awesome that's why I mean I think like (85:26 - 85:35)
definitely Lucario had a huge push like (85:30 - 85:38)
it had its own movie like I think all (85:35 - 85:40)
the ones that are on the top had huge (85:38 - 85:43)
pushes yeah with the exception of (85:40 - 85:46)
Chandler yeah but you know it was weird (85:43 - 85:48)
like Zoroark came in second but I think (85:46 - 85:50)
but we can't say the Chandler didn't (85:48 - 85:52)
because Chandler was a huge part of (85:50 - 85:54)
pokken tournament now that's like that's (85:52 - 85:56)
true there were big pushes for the ones (85:54 - 85:58)
that are at the top there are big media (85:56 - 86:02)
presences for all of these and so like I (85:58 - 86:05)
think one of the big things that they're (86:02 - 86:09)
proving is their media works really well (86:05 - 86:11)
when they push something media wise it (86:09 - 86:14)
really does lodge into people and make (86:11 - 86:16)
them like it a lot more yeah I mean I (86:14 - 86:18)
would say Zurich failed they literally (86:16 - 86:22)
copied a case well no I mean in in (86:18 - 86:25)
marketing I would argue that it seemed (86:22 - 86:26)
like it failed (86:25 - 86:28)
compared to help Ariel I think hockey (86:26 - 86:31)
and pay for carriers you put that I (86:28 - 86:33)
think that's your opinion I disagree (86:31 - 86:35)
with that so much I think Zurich is not (86:33 - 86:38)
the new locario but they did the same (86:35 - 86:40)
thing between Zoroark and look like they (86:38 - 86:42)
took everything they did with Lucario (86:40 - 86:43)
and they applied it to Zurich they gave (86:42 - 86:45)
it their own movie they focused on it (86:43 - 86:48)
they like main innocence in the game (86:45 - 86:50)
like pretend to be another Pokemon no I (86:48 - 86:54)
took his or Ark is cool I thought it did (86:50 - 86:57)
them like pushing it didn't seem to it (86:54 - 87:01)
seemed very forced but they also didn't (86:57 - 87:02)
push it for as long look Hari oh shut up (87:01 - 87:03)
in pokken tournament (87:02 - 87:05)
Lucario shows up in a lot of things I (87:03 - 87:08)
mean they've continued to push Lucario (87:05 - 87:11)
they go home they push you know at the (87:08 - 87:14)
time a few things for Zoroark but they (87:11 - 87:16)
really did not put the weight behind our (87:14 - 87:18)
arc that they did Lucario and zarach (87:16 - 87:20)
still came in number two in that 10 and (87:18 - 87:23)
that Jen if you look at it got very few (87:20 - 87:25)
votes overall (87:23 - 87:28)
like there just wasn't a huge anova push (87:25 - 87:31)
I think he is compared to suno so it's (87:28 - 87:34)
hard to say like it didn't work because (87:31 - 87:36)
there aren't coming in second for them (87:34 - 87:38)
pushing it hard for that one movie and (87:36 - 87:40)
then sort of backing off you know but I (87:38 - 87:44)
pushed it in the game too it still hits (87:40 - 87:47)
really hard but like Zoroark hasn't (87:44 - 87:49)
continued very far out of like zurich (87:47 - 87:51)
was never in pokken tournament it hasn't (87:49 - 87:53)
shown up in a bunch of the spin-off (87:51 - 87:57)
games whereas like Lucario does yeah has (87:53 - 87:58)
more media presence (87:57 - 88:00)
I don't know I could still argue that (87:58 - 88:03)
like Zurich didn't live up to their push (88:00 - 88:04)
like the other Pokemon did like if you (88:03 - 88:06)
look at the point value between (88:04 - 88:09)
Charizard Lucario greninja and zoroark (88:06 - 88:11)
all equal pushes I don't think they were (88:09 - 88:15)
equal pushes I think you know of us if (88:11 - 88:16)
you look at the numbers you know vote (88:15 - 88:18)
was definitely not marketed as hard as (88:16 - 88:21)
all the other one it definitely suffered (88:18 - 88:23)
I mean it it is just it's got lower vote (88:21 - 88:27)
totals across the board I think they (88:23 - 88:29)
didn't know what to do with you Nova and (88:27 - 88:32)
they they didn't do it well they get (88:29 - 88:34)
everything right in you Nova besides (88:32 - 88:36)
market it like the game yet were the (88:34 - 88:41)
right direction opt-ins were the right (88:36 - 88:43)
derive how to market it they just didn't (88:41 - 88:44)
know how to market it yeah what I'm (88:43 - 88:46)
saying I would say the big thing that (88:44 - 88:48)
was wrong with Gen 5 besides marketing (88:46 - 88:51)
was the anime was a bad direction right (88:48 - 88:54)
I think overall the media push for you (88:51 - 88:59)
Nova Kurt you Nova I I don't think it's (88:54 - 89:02)
easy to say that people who voted for (88:59 - 89:04)
Lucario liked it because this I think (89:02 - 89:06)
Lucario has had a much stronger media (89:04 - 89:09)
presence than anything in Genova the the (89:06 - 89:13)
votes clearly show that you Nova was the (89:09 - 89:15)
weakest Oh their Jen's (89:13 - 89:18)
and Lucario came back as a key player in (89:15 - 89:21)
X&Y a lot it's like like they threw that (89:18 - 89:23)
right back in your face (89:21 - 89:26)
Lucario is the first mega evolution (89:23 - 89:28)
Lucario was a mega evolution before (89:26 - 89:31)
Charizard yes like it's actually (89:28 - 89:34)
surprising to me that greninja did not (89:31 - 89:35)
make it into Galler and maybe that will (89:34 - 89:38)
change with the expansion but like just (89:35 - 89:40)
like there will never be a Pokemon game (89:38 - 89:42)
without Pikachu or Eevee there will (89:40 - 89:44)
never be a Pokemon game without (89:42 - 89:46)
Charizard and I can't imagine there will (89:44 - 89:48)
ever be a Pokemon game without Lucario (89:46 - 89:52)
like they're just too popular to cut (89:48 - 89:54)
and watch I don't know like the net like (89:52 - 89:59)
the next game they cut them but I mean I (89:54 - 90:01)
guess like if you I don't know if you (89:59 - 90:03)
like Charizard or look like uh if you (90:01 - 90:05)
like Luke re that much in Lucario wasn't (90:03 - 90:06)
in gallery I think those people sold a (90:05 - 90:09)
bot yeah I mean the greninja people (90:06 - 90:12)
clearly did I think the one thing that (90:09 - 90:16)
unites like Charizard and Lucario (90:12 - 90:21)
is their designs that their designs look (90:16 - 90:25)
fierce yet still remain cute like (90:21 - 90:28)
there's no soap oh c'mon there's a line (90:25 - 90:31)
that they really straddle very well with (90:28 - 90:35)
the sort of very strong look of them (90:31 - 90:38)
that still comes across as very friendly (90:35 - 90:40)
like it's not a mistake that chart like (90:38 - 90:42)
that Lucario looks like a dog that's not (90:40 - 90:44)
a mistake that chars eye looks like a (90:42 - 90:46)
dragon like they are pulling on very (90:44 - 90:51)
strong cultural ties and really hitting (90:46 - 90:57)
the that perfect kid bait point I agree (90:51 - 90:58)
people (90:57 - 91:00)
like dragons (90:58 - 91:05)
like dogs very true I love my dogs (91:00 - 91:08)
be number 30 by the way yeah (91:05 - 91:11)
okay it hard for a bomb B we'll take a (91:08 - 91:14)
break and then I think the last thing we (91:11 - 91:18)
have is just the disaster that will be (91:14 - 91:20)
marched for Pokemon go and then our (91:18 - 91:22)
question of the week and our Pokemon of (91:20 - 91:24)
the week so we will be right back (91:22 - 91:42)
[Music] (91:24 - 91:42)
[Music] (91:44 - 92:03)
Stardust bonuses shadow Entei thunderous (92:04 - 92:12)
and raids and more in March trainers (92:08 - 92:15)
there's just a lot break out your (92:12 - 92:17)
calendar and give us weight it doesn't (92:15 - 92:18)
say that yeah (92:17 - 92:20)
give us your money's give us your money (92:18 - 92:22)
okay there's a lot going on first thing (92:20 - 92:25)
before we get through all of us we'll (92:22 - 92:26)
try to make it as easy as possible and (92:25 - 92:29)
follow is that there was some (92:26 - 92:31)
cancellation for some events so players (92:29 - 92:35)
in Japan South Korea and Italy had some (92:31 - 92:38)
of their events postponed number one (92:35 - 92:43)
shadow ante from Giovanni nope I'm going (92:38 - 92:47)
to complete your rocket research that (92:43 - 92:49)
will be available to the end of March (92:47 - 92:51)
see and in case you didn't know Team (92:49 - 92:55)
Rocket never resets trainers so like if (92:51 - 92:57)
you were halfway through in January that (92:55 - 92:59)
will continue on into February and if (92:57 - 93:01)
you didn't finish in February (92:59 - 93:03)
continue on to March it only resets once (93:01 - 93:05)
you beat the Avani and then it starts (93:03 - 93:07)
over so (93:05 - 93:09)
the March research breakthrough (93:07 - 93:12)
encounter last month it was whoa bat I (93:09 - 93:14)
think the month before that was laparis (93:12 - 93:17)
it is now Feroz Eid and that will go (93:14 - 93:21)
until April first it will be available (93:17 - 93:23)
bonus Stardust this time around it can (93:21 - 93:26)
evolve into Ferrothorn stop here real (93:23 - 93:28)
quick people are really upset that is (93:26 - 93:30)
still not a legendary hasn't been (93:28 - 93:31)
legendary for a while (93:30 - 93:34)
yep I still think they're they're doing (93:31 - 93:37)
Legendary's through Team Rocket now yet (93:34 - 93:40)
but they haven't any new ones have a (93:37 - 93:43)
like it's been all the old right but (93:40 - 93:44)
that's it that's like but that's how it (93:43 - 93:47)
always was like if you were researching (93:44 - 93:50)
like Zapdos when normal trace when it (93:47 - 93:52)
first came out you were already like (93:50 - 93:53)
eight months behind when they were (93:52 - 93:56)
available in raids true (93:53 - 93:59)
I it's weird to me that people complain (93:56 - 94:01)
well that's not weird it's weird to me (93:59 - 94:02)
that there's something about that (94:01 - 94:06)
complain that they were saving their (94:02 - 94:09)
research bonus like fer weeks because (94:06 - 94:10)
they didn't want to get the woo bat and (94:09 - 94:11)
they were hoping that this would be a (94:10 - 94:14)
legendary if you are reading the Silph (94:11 - 94:17)
road and if you are playing Pokemon go (94:14 - 94:17)
everyday (94:17 - 94:20)
nope just nope and no cash in your like (94:17 - 94:23)
it's so it they the people just letting (94:20 - 94:25)
the throws to you people complaining (94:23 - 94:28)
it's like if the game is asking you to (94:25 - 94:31)
do one task a day to get the little (94:28 - 94:35)
stamp I mean I get so it's so easy is (94:31 - 94:36)
one of the easiest things to complete a (94:35 - 94:38)
week the only thing I will say about (94:36 - 94:40)
legendary is not happening in research (94:38 - 94:43)
is in places where there aren't a lot of (94:40 - 94:45)
pocus tops (94:43 - 94:48)
that was one of the easiest ways to be (94:45 - 94:51)
able to get access to Legendary's right (94:48 - 94:55)
and if it's moved to a stop based (94:51 - 94:58)
transaction that is once again hurting (94:55 - 95:00)
communities where they don't have a lot (94:58 - 95:03)
of stops yeah one appleís yeah I am none (95:00 - 95:05)
team rocket appears so much that if (95:03 - 95:07)
you're doing it one team rocket a day (95:05 - 95:11)
it appears at stops so if if you are in (95:07 - 95:13)
a city that has none and you have to (95:11 - 95:16)
travel for one like that is that's not (95:13 - 95:18)
born in the game though is traveling and (95:16 - 95:21)
leaving your house but how far do I have (95:18 - 95:23)
to go where no Poli stops by my house (95:21 - 95:27)
you owe your life will like that's like (95:23 - 95:29)
okay I have to make a 30 to 40 minute (95:27 - 95:32)
trip to get to one that's that's not (95:29 - 95:35)
like us that's not like us who can go (95:32 - 95:37)
five blocks and probably run into one (95:35 - 95:39)
that I don't buy that excuse because you (95:37 - 95:41)
still have to go to the stop to spin it (95:39 - 95:43)
to do the research task and some of the (95:41 - 95:45)
research tasks are you know walk four (95:43 - 95:47)
kilometers to hatch an egg and then you (95:45 - 95:49)
get the stamp like I it's I don't super (95:47 - 95:52)
buy that like you you still have to (95:49 - 95:53)
spend the stops to get the research (95:52 - 95:55)
tasks yeah but you have to then wait for (95:53 - 95:58)
that research text to be a rocket one (95:55 - 96:00)
which is random they you don't know you (95:58 - 96:02)
have to wait for a stop to become a (96:00 - 96:05)
rocket Wonder right which is random if (96:02 - 96:08)
there's one that you hit like you have (96:05 - 96:10)
to hope that you get it like it is it is (96:08 - 96:14)
not ideal and I can see why that upsets (96:10 - 96:18)
people there it should be in both like (96:14 - 96:20)
they should swap them out every once in (96:18 - 96:22)
a while is all I'm saying (96:20 - 96:26)
I get the complaint it's for a seed so I (96:22 - 96:28)
yeah it seems like they're very done (96:26 - 96:29)
with putting legendaries in there I (96:28 - 96:32)
wonder if you have figured out that like (96:29 - 96:35)
oh people whilst operating (96:32 - 96:39)
and just wait this out and if that is (96:35 - 96:43)
the case then venture thunderous come (96:39 - 96:44)
into five star raids starting on Monday (96:43 - 96:46)
March 2nd at 1:00 p.m. (96:44 - 96:48)
thunderous the bolt strike Pokemon will (96:46 - 96:50)
be in five star raids first discovered (96:48 - 96:51)
in the you know very jinnah lectric (96:50 - 96:53)
flying type okay (96:51 - 96:56)
oh here's the big stuff a month of (96:53 - 96:58)
legendary special raid weekends a month (96:56 - 97:03)
of it we're gonna start with dark cry oh (96:58 - 97:05)
gosh I actually didn't know is this (97:03 - 97:08)
coming weekend yeah it's right here (97:05 - 97:11)
dark dark cry special raid weekend will (97:08 - 97:15)
happen from Friday March 6 8 a.m. to (97:11 - 97:19)
Monday March 9th 10 p.m. local time and (97:15 - 97:24)
without using a gameshark this is the (97:19 - 97:28)
first time you can actually get shiny (97:24 - 97:33)
Darkrai unless I'm wrong on that I don't (97:28 - 97:35)
know yeah I don't I don't recall ever (97:33 - 97:38)
seeing a shiny dark right before now so (97:35 - 97:40)
I've seen people hunt Darkrai and they (97:38 - 97:42)
use I think it's called a tweaking (97:40 - 97:46)
glitch to get to the area cuz like em (97:42 - 97:48)
you in so the only way to get a shiny (97:46 - 97:51)
Mew is that if you have a Japanese copy (97:48 - 97:53)
of emerald you get an item called the (97:51 - 97:57)
old sea map yep and the old sea map (97:53 - 97:59)
which was never released in the United (97:57 - 98:02)
States let you go to visit the island (97:59 - 98:05)
where Mew was on and then you could (98:02 - 98:07)
Sofra set that Mew encounter and me you (98:05 - 98:10)
was that shiny locking didn't exist at (98:07 - 98:14)
that point was didn't exist until Gen 5 (98:10 - 98:18)
um so you could softer set and I'm (98:14 - 98:18)
pretty sure (98:18 - 98:24)
Darkrai and Shaymin and Arceus all (98:18 - 98:27)
needed events and I'm almost positive (98:24 - 98:29)
those events didn't come to America I (98:27 - 98:33)
think maybe one of them did but I don't (98:29 - 98:36)
actually know off the top of my head (98:33 - 98:38)
anytime I search for shiny Darkrai it's (98:36 - 98:39)
always like here's the action replay (98:38 - 98:41)
step so these are the codes you have to (98:39 - 98:43)
enter and I mean they've distributed (98:41 - 98:46)
Darkrai but the distributions were (98:43 - 98:48)
always locked dark rice first (98:46 - 98:53)
can be shiny all weekend and then the (98:48 - 98:55)
following weekend will be altered form (98:53 - 98:58)
Giratina special raid weekend that'll be (98:55 - 99:01)
March 13 through the 16th shiny (98:58 - 99:04)
Giratina coab alien will follow the week (99:01 - 99:06)
after that Friday to Monday the 20th to (99:04 - 99:09)
23rd guess what cabal Ian's back it's (99:06 - 99:10)
shiny (99:09 - 99:12)
it has sacred sword it's almost like we (99:10 - 99:14)
said that exactly it was going to happen (99:12 - 99:15)
on the podcast that's why we all skipped (99:14 - 99:18)
cabal Ian's to be good and then again (99:15 - 99:20)
for the hundredth time lluvias coming (99:18 - 99:23)
back from Friday March 27th to the 30th (99:20 - 99:27)
and it will no an exclusive attack which (99:23 - 99:29)
I'm getting tired of this but it will no (99:27 - 99:31)
aerial blast and if you're lucky you can (99:29 - 99:34)
check counter a shiny lugia (99:31 - 99:34)
so every weekend in March it's to my (99:35 - 99:42)
raid event with you know a lot of (99:39 - 99:44)
Pokemon returning for the first time (99:42 - 99:48)
being shiny pokemon with exclusive moves (99:44 - 99:50)
that is not all don't worry there there (99:48 - 99:55)
there's more to this not only ok so I I (99:50 - 99:59)
get it that's clearly proven that people (99:55 - 100:02)
will go out like ok so two things one (99:59 - 100:04)
you don't have to do every event you're (100:02 - 100:06)
not interested in altered form Giratina (100:04 - 100:08)
cool you just don't have to do it thank (100:06 - 100:10)
you for the permission you're very (100:08 - 100:11)
welcome (100:10 - 100:14)
and number two I'm sure that their (100:11 - 100:16)
research has proven that like even (100:14 - 100:17)
though they know that all their players (100:16 - 100:19)
won't do it some of their players will (100:17 - 100:20)
do it and it will still be profitable (100:19 - 100:22)
and it will still be worth doing but (100:20 - 100:25)
there are players that want to get (100:22 - 100:27)
everything we've talked about this (100:25 - 100:30)
before I would like to get everything I (100:27 - 100:32)
have no problem playing to get (100:30 - 100:36)
everything but also even if you were (100:32 - 100:38)
more hardcore than me and I feel like (100:36 - 100:40)
I'm a pretty hardcore Pokemon go player (100:38 - 100:43)
is it actually reasonable to expect your (100:40 - 100:46)
players to have every Friday Saturday (100:43 - 100:50)
and Sunday free for two months straight (100:46 - 100:52)
because it's not like it's not like this (100:50 - 100:54)
was the first month they've done this we (100:52 - 100:57)
just came off of February where every (100:54 - 101:00)
weekend was an event and they're now (100:57 - 101:03)
doing it again I will give you Niantic (101:00 - 101:07)
answer in two parts part the first at (101:03 - 101:10)
least it's not eggs (101:07 - 101:13)
sure a second if it was destiny and they (101:10 - 101:14)
had an event every weekend you'd be (101:13 - 101:16)
sitting in your on your couch playing (101:14 - 101:17)
destiny for hours until you got that (101:16 - 101:22)
event so maybe I don't know if that's a (101:17 - 101:24)
super fair comparison because when (101:22 - 101:26)
Darkrai starts or when Garrett ena (101:24 - 101:29)
starts or when cabal Ian starts I don't (101:26 - 101:31)
know where it's going to be exactly and (101:29 - 101:34)
even if I go there I don't know if other (101:31 - 101:36)
games about going outside yeah no that's (101:34 - 101:39)
fine and so if they would have said like (101:36 - 101:42)
hey Darkrai will be this Saturday from (101:39 - 101:46)
11:00 to 2:00 I know that other players (101:42 - 101:48)
will be there so this is the problem (101:46 - 101:52)
with the this past weekend with the (101:48 - 101:53)
clones (101:52 - 101:56)
so they put charizard blastoise venusaur (101:53 - 101:59)
in five star raids only for this weekend (101:56 - 102:01)
to celebrate Pokemon Day and I was at a (101:59 - 102:03)
convention where there were gyms and (102:01 - 102:05)
there were plenty of Pokemon players (102:03 - 102:08)
around and it was also very close to a (102:05 - 102:11)
park a very big park with good spawns (102:08 - 102:14)
and and good and plenty of gyms to see (102:11 - 102:18)
and I'll admit I wasn't I wasn't on the (102:14 - 102:20)
show floor a whole lot but I was around (102:18 - 102:22)
the PAC's area going from being a (102:20 - 102:24)
meeting I can't say that I was actually (102:22 - 102:27)
you know walking between booths but (102:24 - 102:32)
every time a four star raid popped it (102:27 - 102:34)
was a Marowak (102:32 - 102:36)
and that is that is actually the problem (102:34 - 102:40)
that I think is I am out and about and I (102:36 - 102:43)
and you're you're saying that these (102:40 - 102:45)
these three Pokemon are only available (102:43 - 102:50)
in four star raids for four days yet (102:45 - 102:54)
you're continuing to promote marowak's (102:50 - 102:56)
or you know how many beauty fly raids I (102:54 - 102:59)
saw this weekend who is doing beauty fly (102:56 - 103:03)
like oh yeah for sure three star beauty (102:59 - 103:06)
fly I wouldn't like look you know you (103:03 - 103:08)
wurmples I've hatched I can get a (103:06 - 103:10)
beautiful I can get Amelia beautifly (103:08 - 103:12)
right now I'm swimming in like 2,000 (103:10 - 103:14)
Wurmple candy that's my frustration (103:12 - 103:15)
that's why I was talk to you guys about (103:14 - 103:18)
like I want to do darker I'll do I'll (103:15 - 103:20)
give me an take 20 bucks I'll do 20 card (103:18 - 103:22)
Darkrai raids because I genuinely like (103:20 - 103:25)
dark cry I really do want a shiny hunt (103:22 - 103:26)
this one this is like the first Pokemon (103:25 - 103:28)
in a long time where I was like I (103:26 - 103:31)
actually care about Darkrai shiny but my (103:28 - 103:34)
whole worry is am I even gonna see dark (103:31 - 103:37)
eye raids because I couldn't I didn't (103:34 - 103:39)
even see a single Venus or all weekend (103:37 - 103:42)
and this was going from 30 minutes from (103:39 - 103:45)
Forest Hill to downtown Boston there's a (103:42 - 103:48)
two gyms and every single trade stop I (103:45 - 103:50)
walked through the park both days not a (103:48 - 103:53)
single fire four-star venusaur I saw (103:50 - 103:56)
Charizard and I saw one Blastoise that I (103:53 - 103:59)
was able to do but let me tell you I saw (103:56 - 104:00)
at least four hundred and beautifly's (103:59 - 104:04)
and fifty alone marowak's and I think (104:00 - 104:05)
that's more in the city of Boston (104:04 - 104:11)
there's on Niantic good Boston goes back (104:05 - 104:12)
to the earlier conversation of Pokemon (104:11 - 104:16)
go not being fair which is fine I accept (104:12 - 104:18)
that it's not a fair game (104:16 - 104:20)
but may I live in the 25th of (104:18 - 104:22)
twenty-fifth biggest city in the United (104:20 - 104:25)
States Milwaukee very big I don't have a (104:22 - 104:27)
problem seeing gyms from my house seeing (104:25 - 104:30)
stops from my house I can 15 minutes I (104:27 - 104:31)
can be downtown Milwaukee 15 minutes I (104:30 - 104:33)
can be to one of the best parks in the (104:31 - 104:36)
Wisconsin area to play pokemon go but (104:33 - 104:37)
man when you're in like a city like (104:36 - 104:38)
Boston (104:37 - 104:40)
it makes Milwaukee look like a joke when (104:38 - 104:42)
it comes to Pokemon go like I was able (104:40 - 104:44)
to do so many Team Rocket stops (104:42 - 104:47)
consistently I was able to just (104:44 - 104:51)
spin so many stops and it does help that (104:47 - 104:52)
that City has really good public (104:51 - 104:55)
transport and that city has a lot of a (104:52 - 104:58)
history to it to make a lot of stops but (104:55 - 105:01)
it just like I just imagined be if I (104:58 - 105:03)
lived in Boston I would have every (105:01 - 105:05)
single one of Giovanni's Pokemon heck I (105:03 - 105:07)
would probably have to shadow antes by (105:05 - 105:09)
now and it started today just because of (105:07 - 105:12)
how many stops and how many T market (105:09 - 105:14)
things it is so I I it made me (105:12 - 105:17)
appreciate that like I am lucky to be in (105:14 - 105:20)
the Milwaukee area and have good spawns (105:17 - 105:22)
and have good a good area to play (105:20 - 105:24)
pokemon go but there are just cities (105:22 - 105:25)
that are significantly better for (105:24 - 105:29)
Pokemon go yep and there were plenty of (105:25 - 105:33)
gyms I can do but they weren't the ones (105:29 - 105:36)
that knee antic was promoting so again (105:33 - 105:38)
this is this is my worry is like okay (105:36 - 105:40)
it's available for four days but unless (105:38 - 105:43)
like us three and three other people we (105:40 - 105:46)
could do any Darkrai raid but we got (105:43 - 105:48)
we're gonna have to we're gonna have to (105:46 - 105:51)
set aside time and drive to each one (105:48 - 105:54)
whereas from 11:00 to 2:00 we're gonna (105:51 - 105:56)
put Darkrai in every raid go where you (105:54 - 105:58)
feel comfortable you don't have to (105:56 - 106:01)
coordinate with your friends I mean it's (105:58 - 106:03)
weird because the longer weekend opens (106:01 - 106:05)
up to more people but the longer weekend (106:03 - 106:08)
also means you just have to be lucky and (106:05 - 106:10)
you have to have a raid group which some (106:08 - 106:12)
people are very lucky to have one (106:10 - 106:14)
unfortunately like I don't make me guys (106:12 - 106:18)
like you in Minnesota like you could you (106:14 - 106:20)
two could easily get a raid group and (106:18 - 106:23)
drive and find are crying there are a (106:20 - 106:26)
lot of gyms in downtown Minneapolis and (106:23 - 106:28)
there's an entire group of people all (106:26 - 106:31)
the business people who head out into (106:28 - 106:34)
the skyways at noon and wander around to (106:31 - 106:36)
do all these things like I can easily (106:34 - 106:38)
slide into that group and fall over (106:36 - 106:39)
running and jump in on all these things (106:38 - 106:42)
like it's but again I have like I have (106:39 - 106:45)
to give up my lunch hour to go do it (106:42 - 106:48)
and hope that in that time like granted (106:45 - 106:50)
there's a lot of options in downtown (106:48 - 106:52)
Minneapolis there are a lot of gems but (106:50 - 106:55)
it is a matter of in that in that time (106:52 - 106:59)
period will we see any like as much as (106:55 - 107:01)
we say Mall of America is a good spot (106:59 - 107:02)
they don't have a lot of gyms they have (107:01 - 107:04)
like even though and I was thinking (107:02 - 107:06)
about that too I was like do I just drop (107:04 - 107:09)
everything because I genuinely enjoy (107:06 - 107:11)
Pokemon go and do I Drive six hours in (107:09 - 107:13)
Minnesota this weekend to one hang out (107:11 - 107:15)
with you guys which would be a hundred (107:13 - 107:18)
percent worth it but like what what is (107:15 - 107:20)
our plan of action okay Greg (107:18 - 107:23)
and will do you guys just want to sit at (107:20 - 107:25)
Mall of America for ten hours because at (107:23 - 107:27)
least if a Darkrai pops we can do it but (107:25 - 107:29)
we can't guarantee Darkrai is going to (107:27 - 107:32)
pop and so the other option is okay we (107:29 - 107:34)
have to rope three more friends in and (107:32 - 107:37)
we have to drive to Reiter Aid which (107:34 - 107:40)
ideally should be fun but it's also hey (107:37 - 107:42)
are you ready to drop your entire (107:40 - 107:45)
weekend to do this like I I would (107:42 - 107:48)
because I'm passionate about Pokemon now (107:45 - 107:51)
repeat that four three four yeah coming (107:48 - 107:53)
off of repeating it for a few weeks like (107:51 - 107:56)
I would have if I wasn't traveling and (107:53 - 107:59)
like the three of us were in the city I (107:56 - 108:01)
would be like hey Greg well we can (107:59 - 108:03)
easily do Charizard Venus or Blastoise (108:01 - 108:05)
the three of us let's do it and so we (108:03 - 108:07)
each get one and then we call it a (108:05 - 108:11)
weekend but now repeat that every single (108:07 - 108:13)
week yeah I mean I could do it once like (108:11 - 108:16)
if you really want to do Darkrai I would (108:13 - 108:19)
happily do it but then the rest of the (108:16 - 108:22)
month is mine like I do things on the (108:19 - 108:27)
weekend yeah yeah I do so like I only (108:22 - 108:29)
get I only get a weekend like I do work (108:27 - 108:33)
a lot um and so I can do it once a month (108:29 - 108:38)
without feeling bitter towards the game (108:33 - 108:40)
you guys complained about the eggs now (108:38 - 108:41)
you're complaining about the raids (108:40 - 108:45)
what's next let's talk about okay yeah (108:41 - 108:50)
we could talk about what's next so from (108:45 - 108:53)
so there's another mysterious event (108:50 - 108:56)
coming from Friday March 20th to Monday (108:53 - 109:01)

more normal fire water electric and ice (109:03 - 109:08)

or like maybe you skipped gen 5 fire (109:51 - 109:57)
water Electric ice a bunch of bug type (109:54 - 110:00)
Pokemon spawning I don't know probably (109:57 - 110:03)

fire one being water one being electric (110:03 - 110:07)
one being ice it's a bug type Pokemon (110:05 - 110:08)

repeat of the regigigas event but for (110:08 - 110:13)
genesect that weekend (110:10 - 110:18)

the vernal equinox (110:20 - 110:22)
yeah I mean that and that is something (110:22 - 110:26)
I'm looking forward to right like I (110:25 - 110:29)
thought the regigigas event was good I (110:26 - 110:32)
travelled for it I went an hour south to (110:29 - 110:34)
do regigigas because I wanted an indoor (110:32 - 110:38)
place with a lot of stop gyms I thought (110:34 - 110:40)
it turned out great I thought it was (110:38 - 110:43)
worth the 9 bucks or whatever but that's (110:40 - 110:47)
another event on top of another event (110:43 - 110:49)
Team Rocket is going to be taking over (110:47 - 110:53)

March Pokemon a mystery bonus hour will (113:16 - 113:23)
be a happening every Thursday in the (113:19 - 113:25)
month of March 6 p.m. for both those (113:23 - 113:29)
times local time and your community day (113:25 - 113:31)
Pokemon I believe is Abra does that (113:29 - 113:33)
officially announced yeah well whatever (113:31 - 113:36)
weekend I didn't say sorry I'm sure (113:33 - 113:38)
everyone was taking notes for this will (113:36 - 113:41)
be the community Day weekend with Abra (113:38 - 113:44)
and that's all of March it's literally (113:41 - 113:47)
my more than a full-time job it's way (113:44 - 113:50)
too much yes way too much like and I (113:47 - 113:51)
think of people who play World of (113:50 - 113:54)
Warcraft full-time you know eight years (113:51 - 113:56)
yeah forty hours a week or whatever (113:54 - 113:57)
that's the only game they play and I (113:56 - 113:59)
don't even think those games have that (113:57 - 114:04)
many infants no I mean we just we're (113:59 - 114:07)
about to do the lady's event and ff14 so (114:04 - 114:09)
there's that but it's like one a month (114:07 - 114:12)
the thing is is there's two ways to look (114:09 - 114:14)
at this the problem is that it hurts (114:12 - 114:16)
hardcore players because they have to do (114:14 - 114:18)
something all the time but the question (114:16 - 114:22)
is would they do it anyways and I think (114:18 - 114:23)
that's I'm a little like for me I just (114:22 - 114:26)
look at it and say I'm look I can't do (114:23 - 114:26)
this (114:26 - 114:30)
I'm just not right like you're just (114:26 - 114:31)
getting people to that or I could just (114:30 - 114:34)
skip it and it'll come around again like (114:31 - 114:36)
in some ways is building a healthy (114:34 - 114:39)
relationship with the game because it's (114:36 - 114:40)
so much that for a lot of people you (114:39 - 114:43)
have no choice but to say I can't I (114:40 - 114:47)
can't give this more I really can't (114:43 - 114:51)
especially you know when you're team (114:47 - 114:54)
rocket mystery you're big mystery event (114:51 - 114:55)
weekend is coming up with animal (114:54 - 114:59)
crossing hits oh yeah oh I didn't think (114:55 - 115:00)
about that (114:59 - 115:02)
now the Team Rocket one is this weekend (115:00 - 115:03)
are you saying the genesect event is (115:02 - 115:05)
yeah the mystery event weekend is (115:03 - 115:07)
because Animal Crossing hits the 20th of (115:05 - 115:10)
March well if it's like the regigigas (115:07 - 115:13)
event that takes that took me like two (115:10 - 115:14)
hours to complete but they did be they (115:13 - 115:17)
are now leaving there huh they are not (115:14 - 115:20)
leaving their homes they have to sit at (115:17 - 115:24)
home and pick weeds and pick fruit and (115:20 - 115:26)
and travel to other people's islands to (115:24 - 115:28)
get their fruit so I can get all the (115:26 - 115:29)
fruit (115:28 - 115:32)
look you got just this is just a strong (115:29 - 115:34)
push you have to become a passive player (115:32 - 115:37)
like me yeah and just chill pokeball (115:34 - 115:38)
Plus enjoy it that way (115:37 - 115:40)
complain about the hats you're good to (115:38 - 115:44)
go word I I have I've gotten to the (115:40 - 115:45)
point where I have no problem skipping (115:44 - 115:50)
but picking gym or curious of like is (115:45 - 115:52)
this going to hurt the game because I (115:50 - 115:56)
have seen hardcore people it said it (115:52 - 115:57)
seemed like a lot of them were throwing (115:56 - 115:59)
in the towel this this weekend when this (115:57 - 116:02)
news broke of like we just came off four (115:59 - 116:04)
weeks of constant stuff and you're (116:02 - 116:06)
hitting us with another four weeks I (116:04 - 116:09)
think it will tell like there's a couple (116:06 - 116:11)
ways to look at this this is a desperate (116:09 - 116:14)
chance to try to get a dwindling (116:11 - 116:17)
populace back in the game or this is a (116:14 - 116:21)
how far can we push it just before we (116:17 - 116:23)
lose (116:21 - 116:25)
I imagine if you're a no player and (116:23 - 116:27)
you're dying for content yeah this is a (116:25 - 116:30)
super exciting it's probably great it (116:27 - 116:32)
it's hard to say like there's so many (116:30 - 116:34)
people who would see this as a boon and (116:32 - 116:35)
there's so many people who would see it (116:34 - 116:40)
as Isis yeah like the other thing I (116:35 - 116:42)
think about this is a last point is like (116:40 - 116:45)
does like there is now it feels like (116:42 - 116:47)
there's now an optimal time to play (116:45 - 116:49)
pokemon go where you get the most (116:47 - 116:54)
benefits if they're going to do hey (116:49 - 116:56)
psychic-type pokémon are spawning more (116:54 - 116:58)
in the wild from Friday to Monday and (116:56 - 117:01)
they're repeating that for four weeks (116:58 - 117:03)
why even play Tuesday Wednesday Thursday (117:01 - 117:06)
and if you are gonna play Tuesday those (117:03 - 117:07)
other days that you go to your actual (117:06 - 117:10)
job right then if you do play Thursday (117:07 - 117:12)
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday (117:10 - 117:15)
why play when you know there's a better (117:12 - 117:17)
event happening at 6:00 whether that's (117:15 - 117:19)
double Stardust double xp double candy (117:17 - 117:22)
uh you know more spawns higher shiny (117:19 - 117:24)
chance like well if I only have an hour (117:22 - 117:28)
to play on Tuesday I'm gonna try to make (117:24 - 117:32)
it at six because it's more beneficial (117:28 - 117:34)
for me and if I only have you know 20 (117:32 - 117:37)
hours a week to play pokemon go why (117:34 - 117:39)
would I not save that till Friday (117:37 - 117:42)
Saturday Sunday I don't know like that's (117:39 - 117:44)
like a more of an interesting like not a (117:42 - 117:47)
problem but like a thing I feel like (117:44 - 117:50)
they're setting up mentally (117:47 - 117:53)
um obviously there's a small percentage (117:50 - 117:54)
that will play every day no matter what (117:53 - 117:57)
but if you're trying to manage other (117:54 - 118:01)
video games and I don't know life you (117:57 - 118:03)
can't have to plan for when you're gonna (118:01 - 118:07)
be able to do stuff yep we'll figure out (118:03 - 118:12)
the dark red stuff okay yeah okay (118:07 - 118:12)
I cry save all our questions of the week (118:12 - 118:20)
for the mega episode the 400 and then (118:17 - 118:21)
we're just gonna have no voice anyways (118:20 - 118:24)
so we're gonna just do our pokemon of (118:21 - 118:26)
the week and wrap it up alright Pokemon (118:24 - 118:28)
of the week there it's real quick both (118:26 - 118:30)
sides but start looking up the trivia (118:28 - 118:33)
for this one basically if you're a (118:30 - 118:35)
pokemon mystery dungeon player and you (118:33 - 118:37)
played the rescue team versions of (118:35 - 118:39)
pokemon mystery dungeon then you know (118:37 - 118:42)
that you take a quiz at the beginning (118:39 - 118:45)
and then that's what picks the pokemon (118:42 - 118:48)
that you awaken as in the game because (118:45 - 118:51)
you wake up as a pokemon and the (118:48 - 118:54)
questions that i selected question and (118:51 - 118:56)
answer pairs that i selected for last (118:54 - 118:58)
week's pokemon of the week greg did you (118:56 - 119:04)
do the research that brings you to match (118:58 - 119:08)
up ma chop correct (119:04 - 119:11)
there's some weird things about it (119:08 - 119:13)
basically it's it's based on the nature (119:11 - 119:15)
so the way that you answer the questions (119:13 - 119:17)
determines what nature of Pokemon you (119:15 - 119:20)
are with Machop specifically if you are (119:17 - 119:23)
all brave or have brave is the highest (119:20 - 119:27)

Pokemon with the lowest combined stat (120:47 - 120:51)
total of all weep for the grass types (120:49 - 120:54)
the usurper when touched by mommy will (120:51 - 120:57)
