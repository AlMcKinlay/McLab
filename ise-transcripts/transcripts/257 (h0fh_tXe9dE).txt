[Music] (0:02 - 0:23)
what's up everyone welcome to the 250 (0:20 - 0:25)
seventh episode of the pokemon podcast (0:23 - 0:29)
it's super effective i am your host SBJ (0:25 - 0:33)
and with me today i have will and i have (0:29 - 0:36)
rediscovered how comfortable yoga pants (0:33 - 0:38)
can be i put on my yoga pants that i've (0:36 - 0:40)
had for years so they haven't worn in a (0:38 - 0:43)
long time and boy oh boy what have I (0:40 - 0:45)
been missing out on these things are (0:43 - 0:48)
great no one knows it knows disagreeing (0:45 - 0:50)
with you there how many pairs of yoga (0:48 - 0:52)
pants do you have I know I wouldn't say (0:50 - 0:56)
I have yoga pants but I have I don't (0:52 - 0:57)
know what they're called sweat pants (0:56 - 0:59)
jogging islands nah not even sir (0:57 - 1:02)
different yeah i don't know like special (0:59 - 1:04)
are is there a difference between sweat (1:02 - 1:06)
pants and jogging pants or they're the (1:04 - 1:09)
same and no idea that jogging pant is (1:06 - 1:12)
well joggers is a style of pant but um (1:09 - 1:16)
that it's more like a cut vs a material (1:12 - 1:18)
but yoga pants are like very stretchy (1:16 - 1:21)
like tights except that down towards the (1:18 - 1:22)
bottom they're a little more open and (1:21 - 1:24)
not tight but they're just super comfy (1:22 - 1:26)
for lounging around the house speaking (1:24 - 1:29)
of comfy we have Travis here yeah I also (1:26 - 1:31)
made a discovery this last week which is (1:29 - 1:35)
that I don't like packs yeah you said (1:31 - 1:38)
that we we just got back from pax well (1:35 - 1:40)
we could go now but find out kind of (1:38 - 1:42)
joking but I I guess I guess what I (1:40 - 1:45)
realized was was that big conventions (1:42 - 1:47)
aren't really my thing I had a whole (1:45 - 1:50)
bunch of fun doing our panel and talking (1:47 - 1:51)
with everybody involved with the show (1:50 - 1:53)
and meeting up with everybody we met up (1:51 - 1:58)
with but I that the convention itself is (1:53 - 2:03)
is not really my cup of tea my I'm so (1:58 - 2:04)
particular with the video games I even (2:03 - 2:06)
play anymore that it's all a bunch of (2:04 - 2:09)
games that I haven't heard of most of (2:06 - 2:11)
which have already come out and then I (2:09 - 2:14)
wait in line for a very very long time (2:11 - 2:16)
to play these games I hadn't heard of (2:14 - 2:18)
before hand and so I end up skipping (2:16 - 2:20)
them so yeah it was weird to go to the (2:18 - 2:23)
the thing that some people would say is (2:20 - 2:24)
like the coolest part of the year and (2:23 - 2:28)
for me to realize oh this this isn't for (2:24 - 2:30)
me yeah i think steve and i actually (2:28 - 2:32)
ended up playing more tabletop games (2:30 - 2:33)
than video games (2:32 - 2:38)
hex is uh a weird packs because most of (2:33 - 2:40)
the things being shown were things that (2:38 - 2:43)
were already out yeah which is not (2:40 - 2:46)
normally the case I mean like though is (2:43 - 2:48)
that is that not normally because at (2:46 - 2:50)
that that surprised me but I thought oh (2:48 - 2:54)
maybe this is just how it is no no like (2:50 - 2:58)
at PAX west by the way this is a Pokemon (2:54 - 3:02)
podcast and I'll give you a quick (2:58 - 3:03)
rundown for the show we're going to talk (3:02 - 3:05)
about packs for a little bit because we (3:03 - 3:07)
all three of us got back and then we're (3:05 - 3:09)
going to poke my knees we're gonna we're (3:07 - 3:11)
going to answer some emails and then (3:09 - 3:13)
travis has our poke amount of the week (3:11 - 3:15)
and that's going to be our show it might (3:13 - 3:17)
be a little bit of a shorter shorter (3:15 - 3:20)
side of things but going back to pax at (3:17 - 3:23)
PAX West pretty much everything on the (3:20 - 3:25)
show floor was with stuff that was not (3:23 - 3:28)
out yet like you could play Final (3:25 - 3:31)
Fantasy 15 early which which that was (3:28 - 3:34)
obviously before final fantasy 15 came (3:31 - 3:39)
out they had a huge arc booth which is (3:34 - 3:41)
that dinosaur game and I know they were (3:39 - 3:43)
showing their new expansion early and I (3:41 - 3:44)
could be wrong i don't i don't know that (3:43 - 3:45)
i don't know that game that well but (3:44 - 3:47)
from what app from what I understood (3:45 - 3:49)
that was like the first time you could (3:47 - 3:52)
play that I played the the new destiny (3:49 - 3:54)
expansion there before the destiny stuff (3:52 - 3:56)
came out there was more square enix (3:54 - 3:58)
tough and and just like a bunch of stuff (3:56 - 4:00)
that okay this is definitely the first (3:58 - 4:02)
time I'm playing it and and there wasn't (4:00 - 4:05)
really any of that at East like will and (4:02 - 4:08)
i played toejam and earl yeah even you (4:05 - 4:10)
know that giant triple a title the (4:08 - 4:14)
remake of toejam and earl wish I don't (4:10 - 4:18)
even know what that is was it as 0 0 (4:14 - 4:20)
sega genesis game or something yeah yeah (4:18 - 4:23)
like that so like we played that early I (4:20 - 4:26)
guess that was cool that's the heck of a (4:23 - 4:28)
game will tell you that but yeah it was (4:26 - 4:31)
it was like two days in Travis and will (4:28 - 4:35)
and I are walking and Travis just like (4:31 - 4:37)
leans over and goes I don't think I like (4:35 - 4:41)
packs very much well what were your (4:37 - 4:43)
thoughts I was your first packs right (4:41 - 4:46)
yeah I mean I just had fun because I got (4:43 - 4:47)
to hang out with you guys (4:46 - 4:50)
that was also incredibly fun I should I (4:47 - 4:51)
should make sure I mentioned that I had (4:50 - 4:53)
a blast of a time hanging out with you (4:51 - 4:55)
all and at what was a little different (4:53 - 4:59)
too was I feel like like when we go to (4:55 - 5:02)
gencon we actually have a pretty large (4:59 - 5:03)
group and even like when we did our (5:02 - 5:06)
secret winter retreat we had a pretty (5:03 - 5:09)
large group but for this one it was (5:06 - 5:13)
mostly just like the four of us and that (5:09 - 5:16)
was a lot the fourth one being Irene who (5:13 - 5:19)
I mean obviously not here but I think (5:16 - 5:21)
the best part was when Irene and I had (5:19 - 5:24)
had enough of crowds and we kind of just (5:21 - 5:26)
went back and then watched episodes of (5:24 - 5:29)
hey arnold with the slack community need (5:26 - 5:32)
coloring books and did colouring books (5:29 - 5:36)
yeah big shout out to Nick I'm most of (5:32 - 5:38)
our listeners and slack know Nick as as (5:36 - 5:41)
one of the most active people in her (5:38 - 5:43)
slack community but he's from Boston and (5:41 - 5:45)
home and his wife helped us get around (5:43 - 5:48)
the town a lot easier especially with (5:45 - 5:50)
the the subway system and the buses and (5:48 - 5:54)
stuff and so she's a shout out to to (5:50 - 5:57)
those too but sounds like sounds like (5:54 - 5:58)
Travis you're not going to go back to a (5:57 - 6:04)
pax I mean I mean I i will go back to (5:58 - 6:08)
pax if we have another panel there and (6:04 - 6:10)
it's at a time in the year where I can (6:08 - 6:13)
make it but I mean I want to be able to (6:10 - 6:15)
be there when we have panel shows at (6:13 - 6:18)
conventions because that's really cool (6:15 - 6:20)
and a way we can interact face-to-face (6:18 - 6:24)
with our fans that we really can't (6:20 - 6:26)
otherwise because the show's over the (6:24 - 6:29)
Internet it's I guess it's just a shame (6:26 - 6:32)
that that has to come at activity that i (6:29 - 6:34)
don't really like but i'll take the you (6:32 - 6:36)
know i'll take the bitter pill for the (6:34 - 6:39)
really really cool opportunity to be (6:36 - 6:41)
able to tell bad jokes in front of a (6:39 - 6:44)
room of 400 people d definitely I think (6:41 - 6:46)
it's perfectly okay also to like just (6:44 - 6:49)
focus on going to panels and the smaller (6:46 - 6:51)
types of things like the diversity (6:49 - 6:53)
lounge that we went to yeah going into (6:51 - 6:55)
those kinds of things which aren't the (6:53 - 6:57)
huge crowds the huge lines and (6:55 - 6:58)
everything because that's that's where I (6:57 - 7:00)
had the most fun too oh I and of course (6:58 - 7:01)
also meeting up with our (7:00 - 7:03)
listeners that we did see you know who (7:01 - 7:05)
came up and you know some folks drove up (7:03 - 7:09)
from New York like Kelly just to have (7:05 - 7:12)
lunch so that was really cool yeah yeah (7:09 - 7:15)
i think the the panel went went well for (7:12 - 7:19)
what it was if you guys didn't listen to (7:15 - 7:21)
it yet or or if you weren't a pact that (7:19 - 7:26)
is that is up on our podcast feed 250 (7:21 - 7:29)
listen closely you can hear the sweat (7:26 - 7:34)
drops just rolling face was was that the (7:29 - 7:38)
first time you spoke live Travis that in (7:34 - 7:41)
in a pommy a setting I'm sure you've (7:38 - 7:43)
done a excellent stuff for the podcast (7:41 - 7:45)
yeah I mean it wasn't the it wasn't (7:43 - 7:47)
public speaking that made me nervous so (7:45 - 7:50)
much I've done that a lot i coached I (7:47 - 7:52)
assistant coached a debate team for two (7:50 - 7:55)
years and did high school debate for (7:52 - 7:57)
four years before that so public (7:55 - 7:59)
speaking is not new to me at all but (7:57 - 8:02)
trying to tell jokes and trying to make (7:59 - 8:05)
people laugh in a group like that that (8:02 - 8:07)
is pretty new to me because typically (8:05 - 8:10)
it's in at just a more like persuasive (8:07 - 8:13)
setting than a supposed comedy or (8:10 - 8:15)
entertainment setting it was just a (8:13 - 8:17)
different tinge on something that I did (8:15 - 8:18)
have experience with yeah I just wanted (8:17 - 8:21)
to give a shout out to everyone who did (8:18 - 8:23)
come out we we had a room of 400 people (8:21 - 8:27)
we were in the Bobcat theater and we we (8:23 - 8:30)
filled that room and according to the (8:27 - 8:32)
packs enforcers who talked to me after (8:30 - 8:34)
the show they said they had to turn away (8:32 - 8:37)
about 50 or so people just because we (8:34 - 8:40)
were we were full up and I guess those (8:37 - 8:43)
numbers get reported to somebody at pax (8:40 - 8:46)
and thence that goes on a consideration (8:43 - 8:48)
for future rooms and future ex post and (8:46 - 8:51)
stuff like that so yeah I think the next (8:48 - 8:54)
packs coming up is pax Australia which (8:51 - 8:56)
is probably something not doable not (8:54 - 8:59)
only is it like a 26-hour flight but (8:56 - 9:01)
plane ticket style tralee aren't (8:59 - 9:03)
necessarily the cheapest so we might (9:01 - 9:05)
skip on that but i believe packs wes is (9:03 - 9:07)
coming up after that which is usually (9:05 - 9:10)
the first week or so of sep tember and (9:07 - 9:14)
so i'll apply for a panel there i don't (9:10 - 9:15)
i don't know if we'll get it I don't (9:14 - 9:15)
think (9:15 - 9:17)
anything's guaranteed when it comes to (9:15 - 9:20)
pax but I don't see any shaymin in (9:17 - 9:22)
applying especially because according to (9:20 - 9:24)
the packs enforcers at PAX West that (9:22 - 9:27)
even though we didn't fill the room that (9:24 - 9:29)
time we had an extremely great turnout (9:27 - 9:31)
for a Sunday morning which i think is (9:29 - 9:33)
one of the the worst times to be booked (9:31 - 9:36)
for a panel I don't think anyone wants (9:33 - 9:39)
to wake up first thing on a Sunday and (9:36 - 9:41)
go to a Pokemon gotta get your poke a (9:39 - 9:43)
church-going right yeah especially I (9:41 - 9:45)
would assume that saturday is the big (9:43 - 9:48)
the big stay up late night and what not (9:45 - 9:50)
yet did you know that there's like (9:48 - 9:52)
actually like a lot of parties and stuff (9:50 - 9:56)
yeah we completely didn't do why would (9:52 - 9:58)
like I mean I was aware of my watch (9:56 - 10:01)
ideally have gone yeah I told you to (9:58 - 10:04)
follow pack slimes packs official (10:01 - 10:07)
impacts parties and I thought I did but (10:04 - 10:08)
none of them showed up on my Twitter (10:07 - 10:11)
feed so I they were tweeting all week (10:08 - 10:14)
oops yes if there was like a big gay (10:11 - 10:17)
party that you were like oh you could (10:14 - 10:19)
have gone to this and it ended an hour (10:17 - 10:22)
ago and I was like oh great well let me (10:19 - 10:25)
my tasty burger a good night yeah well (10:22 - 10:26)
if it was the tasty burger night that (10:25 - 10:29)
was our I had to nice team at other (10:26 - 10:31)
nights yeah there's a there's an ihub (10:29 - 10:33)
went up that it was the night we saw (10:31 - 10:36)
giant bomb and we got back Travis and (10:33 - 10:38)
you were already sleeping and yeah that (10:36 - 10:43)
was when the the wind became like a (10:38 - 10:47)
giant blade of pain and it has bit of a (10:43 - 10:50)
tornado situation it was like negative 3 (10:47 - 10:53)
Aryan tornadus situation is somebody (10:50 - 10:55)
coming from Wisconsin I'm very used to (10:53 - 10:57)
the cold but there's just something (10:55 - 10:58)
about that Boston win that was just (10:57 - 11:02)
brutal so while will and I were uber in (10:58 - 11:04)
back to the hotel we had I really uper (11:02 - 11:07)
of jazz yeah that guy who that guy was (11:04 - 11:10)
not not a good driver uh we had Irene (11:07 - 11:12)
order us tasty burger I think we ended (11:10 - 11:14)
up having tasty burger like three or (11:12 - 11:17)
three times in that trip I'll my son (11:14 - 11:19)
tasty burger type person I think I had (11:17 - 11:21)
it one more time maybe it was at the (11:19 - 11:26)
airport but again thank you to everyone (11:21 - 11:28)
who came out to pax and saw since that (11:26 - 11:29)
high and (11:28 - 11:31)
had dinner with us or had lunch with us (11:29 - 11:33)
the next day like it was all fantastic (11:31 - 11:35)
and that's that's why we go to those (11:33 - 11:38)
conventions to like see you guys and to (11:35 - 11:40)
like talk to you and to hang out and I (11:38 - 11:42)
know there was like four or five dudes (11:40 - 11:43)
that came up and they were like hey (11:42 - 11:45)
really liked your show listen every week (11:43 - 11:46)
thank you I'm like they kind of walked (11:45 - 11:48)
off after that and was like I almost (11:46 - 11:50)
wanted to like stop them be like but I'm (11:48 - 11:52)
here now talk to me like I'm here for (11:50 - 11:56)
you guys but I get like people are busy (11:52 - 11:57)
and they're trying to see a hundred (11:56 - 11:59)
things like for being there for three (11:57 - 12:00)
days I think I was only on the show (11:59 - 12:02)
floor for like maybe two hours at most (12:00 - 12:05)
and I barely we complained earlier about (12:02 - 12:08)
not I'm not a lot of new things being on (12:05 - 12:10)
the show floor but I'd even have the (12:08 - 12:12)
time to see everything on the show floor (12:10 - 12:15)
just because of how busy we were but (12:12 - 12:18)
yeah pax was a great experience (12:15 - 12:21)
hopefully will do will do a future packs (12:18 - 12:24)
or pax's but yeah I guess with that (12:21 - 12:26)
being said let's jump into some Pokemon (12:24 - 12:30)
news not a not very heavy news week (12:26 - 12:32)
unless I'm just missing some stuff but (12:30 - 12:34)
first bit of news here is legendary (12:32 - 12:36)
Pokemon head to Pokemon go by the end of (12:34 - 12:39)
the year knee antic CEO promises that (12:36 - 12:42)
we'll be able to really catch them all (12:39 - 12:45)
rare pokemon like mew and mewtwo are set (12:42 - 12:47)
to appear in Pokemon go by the end of (12:45 - 12:51)
2017 according to John Hanke CEO and (12:47 - 12:54)
developer of knee antic in the interview (12:51 - 12:55)
in an interview with the German edition (12:54 - 12:58)
of Wired hankie explains that making (12:55 - 13:00)
legendary Pokemon available to catch in (12:58 - 13:02)
the mobile take of the franchise is a (13:00 - 13:05)
priority for the team this year quote i (13:02 - 13:07)
can say with certainty certainty that we (13:05 - 13:08)
will see them before the end of this (13:07 - 13:10)
year Hankey said when asked about (13:08 - 13:12)
legendary Pokemon player should not (13:10 - 13:15)
expect every rare Pokemon from first and (13:12 - 13:16)
generation to appear though wired (13:15 - 13:18)
specifically just called out five of (13:16 - 13:21)
them mew mew 2 and the 3 legendary birds (13:18 - 13:24)
Articuno Zapdos and Moltres are already (13:21 - 13:26)
included in Pokemon go in an indirect (13:24 - 13:29)
fashion their mascots games three teams (13:26 - 13:33)
the quote the value of Pokemon is that (13:29 - 13:35)
each one is very unique and they have (13:33 - 13:37)
their own stories and characteristics he (13:35 - 13:40)
explained I do want to preserve and if (13:37 - 13:42)
possible enhance the (13:40 - 13:45)
aspect as they are all not the same (13:42 - 13:47)
although he was talking about ditto an (13:45 - 13:49)
uncommon Pokemon who's late introduction (13:47 - 13:51)
to Pokemon go caused a stir late last (13:49 - 13:55)
fall the same philosophy likely applies (13:51 - 13:56)
the legendary Pokemon these (13:55 - 13:58)
one-of-a-kind monsters are hard to find (13:56 - 14:00)
in the main line pokemon games that's (13:58 - 14:03)
not true so it's about no surprise that (14:00 - 14:05)
in the antic intends to make their take (14:03 - 14:08)
view appearances special for the mobile (14:05 - 14:10)
take so basically what they're saying is (14:08 - 14:15)
no Articuno no Moltres know as aptos (14:10 - 14:19)
period at least not for 2017 no they (14:15 - 14:21)
said those three plus mu 2 mu will be (14:19 - 14:25)
available in 2017 oh oh I took that as (14:21 - 14:27)
that they said that because those are (14:25 - 14:30)
the mascots of the three teams that (14:27 - 14:32)
those three wouldn't be in oh they're (14:30 - 14:33)
already included because they're the (14:32 - 14:35)
mascots yeah teams that's what it meant (14:33 - 14:39)
it sounded like but this also means that (14:35 - 14:43)
Mew and Mewtwo are not showing up until (14:39 - 14:46)
December 25th 2017 so don't hold your (14:43 - 14:50)
breath I wonder if its act III doubt (14:46 - 14:51)
it's ever going to be what they (14:50 - 14:55)
originally pitched us which was like 302 (14:51 - 14:58)
flying around Times Square yeah and 300 (14:55 - 15:00)
people all catching it together like I (14:58 - 15:03)
can't imagine that that's that's going (15:00 - 15:05)
to happen we've seen nothing similar to (15:03 - 15:07)
that or even would have to be a (15:05 - 15:09)
completely new mechanic like some sort (15:07 - 15:12)
of maybe like an alert goes out on your (15:09 - 15:15)
phone like miu chi-wah thin one mile and (15:12 - 15:17)
then I'm but it would probably something (15:15 - 15:21)
new like that my guess for the birds is (15:17 - 15:23)
maybe they would introduce something (15:21 - 15:25)
where you know I don't know enough about (15:23 - 15:28)
the back end of that game there are (15:25 - 15:29)
people who know so much more about (15:28 - 15:32)
Pokemon go than I do but my so maybe (15:29 - 15:35)
this isn't possible without major (15:32 - 15:37)
changes but my possible guess is that (15:35 - 15:39)
they might make it so that zapdos (15:37 - 15:42)
Articuno and Moltres are extremely rare (15:39 - 15:49)
spawns near gems that are controlled by (15:42 - 15:52)
that team so an extremely rare this (15:49 - 15:56)
spawn near Mystic Jim might be an (15:52 - 15:56)
Articuno (15:56 - 15:58)
for example or or maybe it's just like (15:56 - 16:02)
it's extremely rare to get a one of the (15:58 - 16:04)
three birds and then whatever the (16:02 - 16:08)
closest gym is it converts it turns into (16:04 - 16:09)
that does that make sense that would be (16:08 - 16:12)
my guess yeah that does make sense I (16:09 - 16:14)
mean what you're trying to say is (16:12 - 16:16)
logically coherent dead don't think it (16:14 - 16:18)
makes sense as an actual tactic to be (16:16 - 16:21)
used in the game but sure I I always (16:18 - 16:23)
assumed going in that we would we would (16:21 - 16:26)
have more promotions or more like (16:23 - 16:30)
sponsorships of like hey there's (16:26 - 16:34)
farfetch at this target on every Sunday (16:30 - 16:36)
and this is the only place to get it and (16:34 - 16:38)
we haven't gotten any of that like the (16:36 - 16:40)
closest thing we got was the starbucks (16:38 - 16:42)
stuff and that was just hey if you go (16:40 - 16:44)
into Starbucks you can order a Pokemon (16:42 - 16:47)
go Frappuccino it has nothing to really (16:44 - 16:50)
do with the game except when you spin (16:47 - 16:52)
the starbucks it's there it reminds you (16:50 - 16:54)
that you could buy this drink can I make (16:52 - 16:57)
a confession goodbye starbucks now when (16:54 - 16:59)
i went to starbucks and i read asked me (16:57 - 17:01)
to get her the pokemon go Frappuccino I (16:59 - 17:06)
didn't even ask them for it yeah I mean (17:01 - 17:08)
it's pretty simple for them to make (17:06 - 17:11)
click two ingredients that was a real (17:08 - 17:14)
busy starbucks I didn't want to deal (17:11 - 17:15)
with that I was of other starbucks that (17:14 - 17:18)
was just like that had turned up the (17:15 - 17:20)
base for some reason when we were in (17:18 - 17:21)
there and it was just a terrible sound (17:20 - 17:24)
system where the base was turned up very (17:21 - 17:26)
nice this was actually a different one (17:24 - 17:28)
because I didn't realize there was a (17:26 - 17:29)
Starbucks around the corner from the (17:28 - 17:31)
hotel so I actually walked a mile to go (17:29 - 17:35)
to a Starbucks good one yup next bit of (17:31 - 17:39)

pronounce things you should probably (25:40 - 25:45)
work on that anyways I was writing to (25:42 - 25:47)
respond about your claim that there is (25:45 - 25:50)
not being a snow cone Pokemon at your (25:47 - 25:52)
PAX East podcast there is a snow cone (25:50 - 25:54)
Pokemon its name is vanilluxe it's as (25:52 - 25:55)
great as you can imagine thanks for the (25:54 - 25:59)
podcast Dominic that was the yeah thanks (25:55 - 26:01)
for running the email that's the that's (25:59 - 26:03)
the joke we were trying to make there is (26:01 - 26:05)
that Steve and I both really really like (26:03 - 26:08)
vanilluxe so and will you like vanilluxe (26:05 - 26:10)
to you right I mean I tolerate it and (26:08 - 26:14)
it's a Pokemon that a lot of people hate (26:10 - 26:17)
so we always bring up that as the like (26:14 - 26:20)
the paragon of Pokemon design so when (26:17 - 26:22)
someone asks us to design a Pokemon from (26:20 - 26:24)
scratch we were like you know I think I (26:22 - 26:25)
think an ice cream cone would be the (26:24 - 26:27)
best Pokemon so we were being a little (26:25 - 26:29)
tongue-in-cheek but I could see how our (26:27 - 26:32)
nervous sarcasm wouldn't really (26:29 - 26:34)
translate very well in communication but (26:32 - 26:36)
yeah a vanilluxe is actually my second (26:34 - 26:40)
favorite Pokemon that was the joke Alex (26:36 - 26:42)
rights in from Thanks for writing in by (26:40 - 26:44)
the way Alex rights in from Salt Lake (26:42 - 26:49)
City Utah tea dear t-dog Little Willie (26:44 - 26:55)

Little Willie I I mean I'm fine with (26:59 - 27:04)
being a little Willy I'm writing on up (27:01 - 27:08)
to it I'm writing because I want to know (27:04 - 27:08)
the answer (27:08 - 27:11)
the most important question ever aerial (27:08 - 27:14)
or Helvetica spj strokes me as a (27:11 - 27:17)
Helvetica kind of guy he's well put (27:14 - 27:19)
together professional and quite overall (27:17 - 27:21)
quite attractive I don't know about that (27:19 - 27:24)
but okay thanks for kind words will (27:21 - 27:26)
seems more of an aerial persona very (27:24 - 27:30)
very played back and casual doesn't care (27:26 - 27:33)
if he isn't as fancy looking but also (27:30 - 27:36)
quite attractive Travis is wing-dings (27:33 - 27:39)
cuz you know I thanks for the last Oh (27:36 - 27:43)
Alex I guess Ariel's bad right we all (27:39 - 27:45)
agree that that's a terrible font it's (27:43 - 27:47)
just trying to look like helvetica but (27:45 - 27:49)
it doesn't do it right yeah and i would (27:47 - 27:51)
like to post a correction that I'm Times (27:49 - 27:54)
New Roman oh all the way times remember (27:51 - 27:57)
the little Times New Roman is also bad (27:54 - 28:00)
well then I'm bad because I am Times New (27:57 - 28:03)
Roman so live with it deal with it uh (28:00 - 28:06)
yeah I'm a typo I like helvetica a lot (28:03 - 28:08)
what were you gonna say Travis my (28:06 - 28:11)
favorite typefaces future features okay (28:08 - 28:13)
they have like weird m's weird capital (28:11 - 28:16)
M's I like the I like the things about (28:13 - 28:19)
future that are weird so yeah I like (28:16 - 28:22)
Gotham a lot I like helvetica a lot I (28:19 - 28:26)
like her haveta canoe which is very (28:22 - 28:28)
different than Helvetica and the one (28:26 - 28:30)
that I have been using a lot especially (28:28 - 28:33)
like Pokemon podcast related as baybay I (28:30 - 28:35)
think it's babe a BB I don't know how (28:33 - 28:37)
people say it but it's BBE I like that (28:35 - 28:40)
font a ton and trying to think of (28:37 - 28:44)
anything else that sticks out in my last (28:40 - 28:48)
job I was doing a lot of graphic design (28:44 - 28:51)
style I was doing a lot of design stuff (28:48 - 28:55)
in my last job and I inherited a logo (28:51 - 28:58)
and basically an entire aesthetic that (28:55 - 29:01)
was built around trajan trajan is the (28:58 - 29:04)
definition of a time-tested font but boy (29:01 - 29:07)
is it not fun to work with it's really (29:04 - 29:11)
hard to build things around like you (29:07 - 29:13)
can't like you can rarely put it in (29:11 - 29:17)
something because it's so I don't know (29:13 - 29:20)
you would have a better time describing (29:17 - 29:22)
the phenomena trying to describe (29:20 - 29:25)
you know what I'm saying yeah it's is it (29:22 - 29:28)
yeah I will I will because you put me on (29:25 - 29:31)
the spot I will struggle them as much as (29:28 - 29:33)
you a veneer is another font that I (29:31 - 29:34)
really like oh you know what maybe I'm (29:33 - 29:36)
not Times New Roman can I be Garamond (29:34 - 29:39)
Garamond is a really good fun it's okay (29:36 - 29:41)
I mean I've got it I've got to be serif (29:39 - 29:44)
I've got to be summer not in love with (29:41 - 29:48)
that I also like Adele a lot as a pharmd (29:44 - 29:51)
not the singer the font but there you (29:48 - 29:53)
gather some font chat for you John (29:51 - 29:56)
writes in from Warwick New York I don't (29:53 - 29:59)
know whether where that is war with New (29:56 - 30:01)
York yeah well it is west of East (29:59 - 30:03)
Warwick hi there just wanted to start by (30:01 - 30:05)
saying that I listen to your show during (30:03 - 30:07)
the Sun and Moon special coverage and I (30:05 - 30:09)
really liked what I heard now I'm a (30:07 - 30:11)
subscriber and I'm slowly going for the (30:09 - 30:14)
backlog of earlier episode I recently (30:11 - 30:17)
listen to episode 2 25 anxiety (30:14 - 30:20)
meditation comfy with Dan reichert the (30:17 - 30:21)
title caught my eyes it was scrolling (30:20 - 30:24)
through as I suffer from anxiety the (30:21 - 30:26)
episode was very helpful to me and i (30:24 - 30:28)
bought Dan's book that night I liked (30:26 - 30:30)
that the change of pace a little bit of (30:28 - 30:32)
a serious topic introduced with regular (30:30 - 30:35)
pokemon stuff I'm hoping for more I'm (30:32 - 30:37)
hoping for more of that sprinkled into (30:35 - 30:41)
the norm if topic fits I think anxiety (30:37 - 30:43)
is a topic that a lot of gamers can (30:41 - 30:45)
relate to so thank you for having that (30:43 - 30:47)
special episode I have a question for (30:45 - 30:50)
all of you which combination that has (30:47 - 30:52)
not been used a Pokemon game would you (30:50 - 30:54)
eventually like to see I'd like to see (30:52 - 30:57)
an ice / poison Pokemon thanks again for (30:54 - 31:00)
doing what you do and helping John from (30:57 - 31:03)
Warwick New York so can you read a list (31:00 - 31:05)
of Pokemon combinations that have not (31:03 - 31:08)
been used there's a bubble PD article (31:05 - 31:10)
I'm calling the read that list before (31:08 - 31:13)
yeah as you guys are pulling that up (31:10 - 31:18)
I'll comment on the the Dan article so (31:13 - 31:22)
for maybe newer listeners or those who (31:18 - 31:26)
haven't been listening as long to 25 or (31:22 - 31:30)
is it to 26 to 26 sorry that episode (31:26 - 31:33)
with dan dan reichert is one of the (31:30 - 31:35)
editors over at Giant Bomb (31:33 - 31:38)
and I was able to get him on the show he (31:35 - 31:42)
has written a couple books at to one of (31:38 - 31:45)
them being one of them being on his (31:42 - 31:47)
anxiety and how he deals with that and (31:45 - 31:49)
that was book I picked up in I read and (31:47 - 31:52)
I'm a big fan of giant bomb huh so (31:49 - 31:54)
having him on the show and talking to (31:52 - 31:55)
him about that book was was something (31:54 - 31:57)
that was really important to me and I (31:55 - 31:59)
think that's kind of how I want most of (31:57 - 32:03)
the interviews to be on the show we've (31:59 - 32:05)
had people like Griffin macro Xavier (32:03 - 32:08)
woods Dan Reicher gaijin hunter a whole (32:05 - 32:10)
bunch of other people on the show and (32:08 - 32:14)
they all like this is a Pokemon show (32:10 - 32:16)
right so we always start off asking them (32:14 - 32:17)
a couple Pokemon questions and we end (32:16 - 32:19)
the show asking them with a couple (32:17 - 32:21)
Pokemon questions but really the the (32:19 - 32:24)
middle part of those interviews aren't (32:21 - 32:26)
supposed to be Pokemon focused like it's (32:24 - 32:28)
nice that they like Pokemon there oh (32:26 - 32:31)
that Pokemon has influenced them in some (32:28 - 32:33)
way and that has brought them to our (32:31 - 32:35)
show to talk about that but really it's (32:33 - 32:38)
more to get to know them and to kind of (32:35 - 32:41)
take the step outside of pokemon and and (32:38 - 32:43)
have those kind of conversations and so (32:41 - 32:46)
that's something that's important to me (32:43 - 32:47)
and something that I think that works (32:46 - 32:49)
well with the podcast that we would that (32:47 - 32:52)
we do every now and then I think the to (32:49 - 32:54)
just extend on that I think that the (32:52 - 32:57)
writer of the email was also suggesting (32:54 - 33:00)
that maybe we include more serious (32:57 - 33:03)
content in the non interview portions of (33:00 - 33:05)
the show too just because they didn't (33:03 - 33:08)
mention any specifics of where they (33:05 - 33:09)
would like to see that and I think (33:08 - 33:11)
what's where it gets interesting there (33:09 - 33:13)
is because the rest of the show has (33:11 - 33:17)
fallen into such a I don't want to say (33:13 - 33:20)
routine because now i guess the it's I (33:17 - 33:23)
mean you're getting different you know (33:20 - 33:25)
different takes every week different (33:23 - 33:26)
takes on things but it's you know it's (33:25 - 33:29)
we go through what we've been doing this (33:26 - 33:30)
week then we go through the news than we (33:29 - 33:32)
do and lately we've been doing a lot of (33:30 - 33:34)
emails and then we always do pokemon of (33:32 - 33:36)
the week and I think it's difficult to (33:34 - 33:40)
find serious subject matter every week (33:36 - 33:42)
with those (33:40 - 33:45)
things but I think we have even more (33:42 - 33:48)
recently done a little bit more of that (33:45 - 33:51)
starting I think with the Sun and Moon (33:48 - 33:53)
series but then just going on in like a (33:51 - 33:55)
few episodes that followed it where (33:53 - 33:58)
where this this group as opposed to the (33:55 - 34:00)
sun and moon series group sort of (33:58 - 34:04)
responded to the to the email response (34:00 - 34:08)
to the Sun and Moon series so I think it (34:04 - 34:10)
comes in waves like that right like (34:08 - 34:12)
occasionally something will come up like (34:10 - 34:15)
that like the team skull topic came up (34:12 - 34:17)
in the sun and moon series and then for (34:15 - 34:19)
a couple of episodes we'll talk about (34:17 - 34:21)
that more serious subject matter and (34:19 - 34:23)
then a lot of episodes like this where (34:21 - 34:25)
we're not really talking about something (34:24 - 34:28)
too serious because there's nothing (34:25 - 34:32)
topically relevant that is topically (34:28 - 34:34)
relevant to Pokemon that we would need (34:32 - 34:36)
right now to talk about but I don't (34:34 - 34:39)
think any of us are averse to doing that (34:36 - 34:41)
more if that's what people want to see (34:39 - 34:44)
ya yeah I don't want to say well send in (34:41 - 34:46)
more serious emails and we can address (34:44 - 34:49)
them there but I do say stop asking us (34:46 - 34:51)
about what type comment not kidding I do (34:49 - 34:53)
say at the beginning of the email (34:51 - 34:56)
segment you can send in emails about (34:53 - 34:58)
pokemon or not about Pokemon and we'll (34:56 - 34:59)
we'll address them all and we'll talk (34:58 - 35:03)
about typefaces and whatever whatever (34:59 - 35:05)
floats our way we're not we're not (35:03 - 35:07)
really sure Travis what was the worst (35:05 - 35:12)
day if your see it totally uh glad that (35:07 - 35:15)
that episode though like helped in some (35:12 - 35:19)
way chose a list of type combinations (35:15 - 35:22)
that haven't been used I've figured (35:19 - 35:24)
you'd have it let's hear it well I hold (35:22 - 35:26)
it up that's a long list dude oh we're (35:24 - 35:29)
gonna go for it a normal poison normal (35:26 - 35:32)
Rock normal bug normal ghost normal (35:29 - 35:34)
steel normal ice fighting ground (35:32 - 35:37)
fighting electric fighting fairy poison (35:34 - 35:39)
steel poison electric poison psychic (35:37 - 35:42)
poison ice poison fairy ground fairy (35:39 - 35:47)
Rock ghost bug psychic it's hot are you (35:42 - 35:49)
even able to tell when I'm saying one (35:47 - 35:52)
and then a new one I was and then you (35:49 - 35:54)
like fell out of rid of them for sale (35:52 - 35:56)
oh and we feel it's kind of like you're (35:54 - 35:58)
making up a word it doesn't even sound (35:56 - 36:00)
like a real word it also they doing the (35:58 - 36:03)
thing where they went what are happening (36:00 - 36:06)
it is the list doing the thing where (36:03 - 36:09)
they're considering normal poison to not (36:06 - 36:11)
be a type and then poison normal and to (36:09 - 36:13)
not be in sight because they're they're (36:11 - 36:15)
not counting permutation okay good (36:13 - 36:19)
hominy else I'll start over and normal (36:15 - 36:23)
poison normal Rock normal bug normal (36:19 - 36:28)
ghost normal steel normal ice fighting (36:23 - 36:30)
ground fighting electric that would be (36:28 - 36:32)
mine right there fighting electric I (36:30 - 36:33)
can't believe there's not a fighting (36:32 - 36:37)
electric fighting fairy poison steel (36:33 - 36:41)
poison electric poison psychic poison (36:37 - 36:46)
ice poison fairy ground fairy Rock ghost (36:41 - 36:52)
bug psychic bug ice bug dragon bug dark (36:46 - 36:58)
fire grass fire ice fire fairy electric (36:52 - 37:03)
dark dark fairy and then yet that's the (36:58 - 37:06)
last one that wasn't that many uh well I (37:03 - 37:08)
guess cuz the list i'm looking at had (37:06 - 37:11)
the opposite directions oh yeah yeah (37:08 - 37:13)
everybody comes down to it it sounds (37:11 - 37:15)
like poison is the one that's that's not (37:13 - 37:17)
mixed with a lot of other types and (37:15 - 37:20)
normal and normal still has a lot of its (37:17 - 37:22)
combinations not added in and a lot of (37:20 - 37:25)
normal combinations are unique type (37:22 - 37:29)
combinations like normal ground is only (37:25 - 37:32)
diggersby right and normal psychic is (37:29 - 37:35)
only to rafa reg and normal dragon is (37:32 - 37:38)
only dreamt like there's yeah but my (37:35 - 37:40)
choice would be normal ghost because I (37:38 - 37:41)
just think that that would be too cool (37:40 - 37:44)
can't be hit by normal type moves can't (37:41 - 37:45)
be hit by fighting-type moves can't be (37:44 - 37:47)
hit by ghosts type moves I want to see a (37:45 - 37:50)
bug dragon that'd be cool I Joey rights (37:47 - 37:54)
in from Pennsylvania PA what's that yeah (37:50 - 37:57)

for wheel wells don't don't get me wrong (38:08 - 38:14)
you are awesome but in in the packs (38:11 - 38:16)
podcast you said you hated and would not (38:14 - 38:18)
play stardew valley because you don't (38:16 - 38:21)
play farming simulators but then you (38:18 - 38:23)
said you loved farming berries and (38:21 - 38:25)
pokemon games let's dig dip let's dig (38:23 - 38:28)
deep here what's your beef with stardew (38:25 - 38:29)
valley I've never played it but I've (38:28 - 38:31)
watched people on twitch and I'm just (38:29 - 38:33)
curious love the podcast and all three (38:31 - 38:35)
of you guys and Micah and Irene as well (38:33 - 38:38)
considering the Sun and Moon week-long (38:35 - 38:40)
podcast was what introduced me to the (38:38 - 38:44)
show thanks Joey will doesn't like (38:40 - 38:46)
glorifying work under a feudal system (38:44 - 38:49)
well I don't know any I mean I honestly (38:46 - 38:50)
don't know very much about stardew (38:49 - 38:52)
valley at all because once I found out (38:50 - 38:54)
that it was a farming simulator I didn't (38:52 - 38:57)
look at it but somebody got me as a (38:54 - 39:00)
birthday present one year that like the (38:57 - 39:02)
most famous of the farming simulators (39:00 - 39:05)
what is that one harvest moon harvest (39:02 - 39:08)
moon our review d there's a lot of bad (39:05 - 39:10)
harvest moon games there are a lot of (39:08 - 39:12)
bad at harvest moon dams yes one harvest (39:10 - 39:15)
moon 3d is one of the bad ones yeah yeah (39:12 - 39:17)
that was one of the bad ones and when I (39:15 - 39:19)
found out that I couldn't marry a guy (39:17 - 39:22)
and that we could be farmers together I (39:19 - 39:24)
was like why am I wasting my time this (39:22 - 39:27)
this game is boring and awful you can (39:24 - 39:30)
marry a character of the same gender I (39:27 - 39:33)
played as a girl and I married a girl so (39:30 - 39:35)
well some I thought that was one of the (39:33 - 39:37)
ones where you couldn't either way its (39:35 - 39:38)
just oh no I'm talking about I'm talking (39:37 - 39:41)
about in and start gargle yeah that (39:38 - 39:42)
should be on yeah but unfortunately (39:41 - 39:45)
harvest moon may destroyed all future (39:42 - 39:46)
hope of farming simulators for me and (39:45 - 39:48)
honestly me a requirement that for a (39:46 - 39:52)
woman yeah Barry farming in pokemon is (39:48 - 39:55)
not a farming simulation it's a chance (39:52 - 39:59)
to get little lady buzz to show up in (39:55 - 40:01)
your bushes and then you catch them as (39:59 - 40:04)
they are pokemon it's it's it's yeah (40:01 - 40:07)
it's not cord the game like you have to (40:04 - 40:08)
make these crops in order to make money (40:07 - 40:12)
and survive now no I I have a hard (40:08 - 40:14)
enough time surviving in the real world (40:12 - 40:15)
I don't need it to be a struggle in my (40:14 - 40:17)
video games as well I but insert a (40:15 - 40:19)
valley you don't have to (40:17 - 40:21)
grow anything like you can yeah that's (40:19 - 40:23)
the interesting thing about that game is (40:21 - 40:27)
the surprising depth of the other aven't (40:23 - 40:29)
like that well certainly I guess the (40:27 - 40:31)
variety of ways in which you can run (40:29 - 40:33)
your farm right like you can just have (40:31 - 40:38)
it be the honey bee a generator or like (40:33 - 40:41)
like a honey generator or a like a (40:38 - 40:45)
brewery or um or whatever but then even (40:41 - 40:47)
the other avenues you can take like (40:45 - 40:50)
especially mining there's a lot going on (40:47 - 40:53)
there it takes a long time to mine all (40:50 - 40:55)
the way down to the bottom of the mine (40:53 - 40:57)
and even then there's more to do so yeah (40:55 - 40:59)
I guess that so it's the depth of the (40:57 - 41:01)
other activities that really surprised (40:59 - 41:04)
me hows about this other call out to the (41:01 - 41:08)
PAX East panel number one does start a (41:04 - 41:10)
valley involve or require collecting (41:08 - 41:13)
things yes there are none when rare (41:10 - 41:16)
crows you got to collect them all okay a (41:13 - 41:18)
is not you said required though like you (41:16 - 41:20)
don't have to do any like you don't have (41:18 - 41:22)
to like it doesn't stop your progress of (41:20 - 41:24)
the game there's also an achievement if (41:22 - 41:27)
you sell one of every single item in the (41:24 - 41:29)
game so you can count that as collecting (41:27 - 41:30)
to all right I'll give that to you (41:29 - 41:33)
number two does it have cute things in (41:30 - 41:35)
it yeah yeah there's a lot of like cute (41:33 - 41:38)
animals and stuff number three does it (41:35 - 41:41)
involve rolling yeah you know one you (41:38 - 41:43)
can roll with your cows all day long (41:41 - 41:45)
would you stop with your roll with your (41:43 - 41:47)
crew roll with your cows that's a bad (41:45 - 41:50)
joke I'm trying to think I there's got (41:47 - 41:53)
to be something what would try that is (41:50 - 41:54)
out of the desert there's a bunch of (41:53 - 41:57)
gambling games you can play yeah not (41:54 - 42:00)
rolling roll the slots um that's not (41:57 - 42:01)
that is rolling what else would I call (42:00 - 42:06)
it I when you tuck into a ball and roll (42:01 - 42:08)
and roll around like a ball that's the (42:06 - 42:10)
only role that I'm interested in I'm (42:08 - 42:12)
trying to think if you roll any like (42:10 - 42:14)
snowballs in any of the winter holidays (42:12 - 42:17)
Oh like an animal crossing a truly great (42:14 - 42:20)
game where you can roll a little snowman (42:17 - 42:23)
yeah I'm trying to think if there's that (42:20 - 42:25)
and started valley I can't remember ah (42:23 - 42:28)
the rolling stipulation is tough to get (42:25 - 42:30)
around with you why do you play uh why (42:28 - 42:32)
do you play monster hunter (42:30 - 42:34)
because you roll whenever you're on fire (42:32 - 42:36)
to put yourself out and you roll the (42:34 - 42:38)
dodge from the monster why do you does (42:36 - 42:40)
they're like dodge rolling in destiny or (42:38 - 42:44)
something uh there is not but I really (42:40 - 42:46)
don't play that much money mm except (42:44 - 42:49)
that you did a lot how did your patrol (42:46 - 42:51)
the grounds were playing I said again (42:49 - 42:52)
your pegs are all on the ground eggs (42:51 - 42:55)
roll away from you action i'll take a (42:52 - 42:57)
roll away but in real life i think but i (42:55 - 42:58)
think you but I think don't the pigs (42:57 - 43:00)
sometimes no they don't really roll even (42:58 - 43:02)
yeah I don't think I don't think we have (43:00 - 43:04)
roll what about the jelly things in 30 (43:02 - 43:07)
Valley they roll right you can like get (43:04 - 43:09)
a cage of jelly things I don't what (43:07 - 43:12)
they're called climb the their type of (43:09 - 43:14)
locomotion could only arguably be (43:12 - 43:16)
described as rolling I think they more (43:14 - 43:19)
they kind of slurp around what about the (43:16 - 43:22)
minecarts they roll down the mine shaft (43:19 - 43:27)
yeah yeah now sorry pass hard pass I (43:22 - 43:28)
mean at some point you can have kids in (43:27 - 43:31)
that game if you marry if you don't (43:28 - 43:32)
marry same-sex and there's some rolling (43:31 - 43:36)
that happens they don't think it's in (43:32 - 43:38)
the real world why would I want kids in (43:36 - 43:40)
the video saying that is rolling (43:38 - 43:42)
involved you you might want not one to (43:40 - 43:44)
partake but there's oh there's indeed (43:42 - 43:46)
Rome one of the at one of the animations (43:44 - 43:50)
of that of the kids does roll boom it's (43:46 - 43:52)
their got you and it's there it's in it (43:50 - 43:55)
not not for me not gonna happen you try (43:52 - 43:57)
stardew valley it's good do you like one (43:55 - 43:59)
more email here Aaron writes in hey guys (43:57 - 44:01)
hope you're doing well of the show let's (43:59 - 44:04)
get down to life's real tough questions (44:01 - 44:07)
which is better pizza or burgers also (44:04 - 44:10)
will is the best because he lifts also (44:07 - 44:12)
because he house me for a week when I (44:10 - 44:15)
was in DC all the best Aaron from (44:12 - 44:17)
Oklahoma I was only like three days it (44:15 - 44:21)
wasn't a whole week haha dad don't like (44:17 - 44:23)
you as he welcomed if you were there for (44:21 - 44:27)
all know Aaron's cool i like Aaron uh (44:23 - 44:31)
hmm well when it is sugar we thought (44:27 - 44:34)
choice workers I would probably say (44:31 - 44:37)
burgers cuz you get more protein so (44:34 - 44:40)
there you go hmm I feel like it's it's (44:37 - 44:43)
easier to mess up a burger that it is a (44:40 - 44:45)
pizza if it then you just send it back (44:43 - 44:46)
it's really hard because P (44:45 - 44:48)
Pizza usually get there you go where (44:46 - 44:51)
they make you sad burgers yeah also that (44:48 - 44:53)
no no just like okay okay so like you (44:51 - 44:56)
can go to like tasty burger right and (44:53 - 44:59)
you can get a pretty decent burger I I (44:56 - 45:00)
think we all agree those burgers were (44:59 - 45:04)
good hello my guts didn't agree late on (45:00 - 45:06)
Saturday night but sure the flavor was (45:04 - 45:08)
there right but then you can go to like (45:06 - 45:13)
Applebee's and pay double the amount for (45:08 - 45:16)
a burger and that burger is mediocre I (45:13 - 45:18)
really need to go to the tasty burger in (45:16 - 45:20)
DC don't I so you see what I'm saying (45:18 - 45:24)
where where I could get either pizza hut (45:20 - 45:27)
or papa johns or dominoes and all those (45:24 - 45:29)
pizzas are different but at the end of (45:27 - 45:31)
the day it's like ah that was pizza and (45:29 - 45:34)
pizza is good but so well no all I'm (45:31 - 45:36)
gonna say is like you usually don't get (45:34 - 45:38)
delivery burgers so if you get a bad (45:36 - 45:40)
burger it's easy to send it back and say (45:38 - 45:43)
no this burger is bad but you usually (45:40 - 45:46)
get delivery pizza where and then if (45:43 - 45:48)
it's bad you can't really send it back (45:46 - 45:51)
yeah but if you really want a burger and (45:48 - 45:53)
you're stuck at like applebees you're (45:51 - 45:55)
not there's nothing you can do that (45:53 - 45:57)
that's it in that situation to get a (45:55 - 46:00)
good burger no matter how many times you (45:57 - 46:03)
send it back yeah it's never gonna get (46:00 - 46:07)
any better I am gonna say pizza because (46:03 - 46:09)
I'm a socialist and I like the inherent (46:07 - 46:12)
sharing that's almost required by a (46:09 - 46:16)
pizza because very infrequently are you (46:12 - 46:17)
going to eat a whole one by oneself (46:16 - 46:20)
speak for yourself sir there's also a (46:17 - 46:23)
I've done it don't get me wrong but (46:20 - 46:25)
generally a pizza is a thing to be (46:23 - 46:27)
shared and I find that to be an (46:25 - 46:33)
admirable quality there's also the the (46:27 - 46:36)
multiple layers of burger and how like (46:33 - 46:39)
sometimes the meat can be too thick or (46:36 - 46:42)
the buns can be too thin there's like (46:39 - 46:44)
this balance though the meat to bun (46:42 - 46:47)
ratio has to be has to be really right (46:44 - 46:49)
for a burger to hit it spot I mean I (46:47 - 46:51)
would probably say that burgers are (46:49 - 46:52)
better than pizzas I'm just saying that (46:51 - 46:56)
burgers have more opportunity of failure (46:52 - 46:59)
then a pizza does can we talk about (46:56 - 47:01)
colonialism for (46:59 - 47:05)
why because how fascinating is it that (47:01 - 47:08)
we when you think of Italy and even if (47:05 - 47:10)
you were trying to think of like three (47:08 - 47:12)
ingredients right of Italian cuisine (47:10 - 47:14)
that are just like a central to italian (47:12 - 47:16)
cuisine you're in thing of like pasta (47:14 - 47:18)
you're gonna think of cheese maybe and (47:16 - 47:22)
then I mean maybe someone who really (47:18 - 47:24)
knows the talin cuisine would say (47:22 - 47:25)
something different but then at least a (47:24 - 47:27)
layperson would say that the third one (47:25 - 47:29)
is tomato right because like tomato (47:27 - 47:31)
sauce is in a lot of at least (47:29 - 47:33)
Americanized Italian food and I would (47:31 - 47:35)
guess a lot of Italian food generally (47:33 - 47:38)
the tomato is indigenous to North (47:35 - 47:41)
America I think it's interesting that (47:38 - 47:45)
and the pasta is indigenous to China (47:41 - 47:48)
right so so it's interesting that the (47:45 - 47:53)
the cultural identities of even the (47:48 - 47:56)
colonizers are pretty wildly changed by (47:53 - 47:58)
that activity was this have to do with a (47:56 - 48:00)
good burger not that not that Italy was (47:58 - 48:02)
in part whatever I just think it's (48:00 - 48:05)
interesting that you don't get Italian (48:02 - 48:07)
cuisine and you don't get pizza until (48:05 - 48:10)
you get the colonization I'm not saying (48:07 - 48:12)
either way what I think about (48:10 - 48:14)
colonization but i'm sure you can read (48:12 - 48:16)
between the lines I like a good burger I (48:14 - 48:18)
do like burgers but yeah i'm i'm gonna (48:16 - 48:21)
say pizza is my answer alright well i (48:18 - 48:22)
think that should wrap it up wrap it up (48:21 - 48:24)
for emails we still have a bunch in the (48:22 - 48:27)
in the in the hopper the the hopper of (48:24 - 48:30)
emails we'll get to those next week and (48:27 - 48:32)
if you have your own emails that you (48:30 - 48:35)
want to write in you can do so at SBJ at (48:32 - 48:40)
pkmn cast com or pokemon podcast com hit (48:35 - 48:43)
that contact button and that'll let you (48:40 - 48:45)
send an email to the same place (48:43 - 48:47)
otherwise we're gonna switch gears here (48:45 - 48:50)
now throw it over to Travis and they are (48:47 - 48:53)
going to do the Pokemon of the week (48:50 - 48:55)
that's right our pokemon of the week (48:53 - 48:59)
this week is porygon to which gets a lot (48:55 - 49:01)
more use than its evolution porygon z (48:59 - 49:03)
because poori onto is pretty much the (49:01 - 49:06)
best pokemon in the game to use the item (49:03 - 49:09)
evo light ed light is an item that gives (49:06 - 49:11)
a boost to the defense and special (49:09 - 49:14)
defense of a pokemon that has the (49:11 - 49:14)
capability (49:14 - 49:17)
to evolve other pokemon that pen they (49:14 - 49:20)
use at our pokemon like chancy our move (49:17 - 49:23)
set this week and so all of this as (49:20 - 49:25)
we've been doing for quite a while is (49:23 - 49:28)
going to be in VGC doubles our move set (49:25 - 49:29)
for this week i'm going to give you to (49:28 - 49:32)
our first one comes from brandon weisner (49:29 - 49:35)
and brandon is actually giving us the (49:32 - 49:39)
move set from gavin Michaels who won to (49:35 - 49:42)
regionals with this porygon too that's (49:39 - 49:45)
porygon to with EVO light the ability (49:42 - 49:49)
download the EVs are 252 and HP 252 and (49:45 - 49:51)
defense Foreign special attack with a (49:49 - 49:54)
bold nature the moves are ice beam (49:51 - 49:57)
Thunderbolt recover and trick room it (49:54 - 50:01)
also makes note to have zero IVs in (49:57 - 50:03)
attack and speed that's something you (50:01 - 50:06)
see a lot the zero IVs an attack is (50:03 - 50:08)
because you want to have the least (50:06 - 50:11)
amount of damage dealt from whoo boy (50:08 - 50:12)
what's the name of that move how am I (50:11 - 50:14)
forgetting it already the one that deals (50:12 - 50:19)
damage based on the targets attack grass (50:14 - 50:21)
a dark-type move nope that's tongue one (50:19 - 50:25)
based on weight nope it's uh ahaha (50:21 - 50:29)
pursuit no that's the one that snowman (50:25 - 50:33)
no make good guesses um give me at least (50:29 - 50:38)
the dark type moves yeah it's a grass (50:33 - 50:40)
not isn't a dark-type move well uh for (50:38 - 50:47)
ISA dark fowl play foul play that's what (50:40 - 50:50)
it is thank you will the zero attack e (50:47 - 50:53)
Ivy's rather is to prevent damage from (50:50 - 50:58)
foul play and the zero speed Ivy's are (50:53 - 51:00)
so that because Morgan to you isn't (50:58 - 51:03)
going to outspeed anything in general (51:00 - 51:06)
having the zero speed IVs and then the (51:03 - 51:08)
bold nature is going to ensure that you (51:06 - 51:11)
can act as like a counter to trick room (51:08 - 51:13)
if it does get engaged because if you (51:11 - 51:14)
think about it like you're not going to (51:13 - 51:15)
speed anything anyway so you might as (51:14 - 51:18)
well have porygon to be as slow as (51:15 - 51:21)
possible um and like I said the moves (51:18 - 51:23)
are ice beam Thunderbolt recover and (51:21 - 51:26)
trow its trick room so it's also because (51:23 - 51:27)
you're running trick room so nevermind (51:26 - 51:28)
what I just said before but (51:27 - 51:31)
zero speed IVs because you're running (51:28 - 51:34)
trick room um ice beam Thunderbolt (51:31 - 51:36)
recover and trick room he set up trick (51:34 - 51:37)
room so you're slow Pokemon can actually (51:36 - 51:40)
move first recover because this is a (51:37 - 51:43)
bulky Pokemon anyway and it's extremely (51:40 - 51:45)
hard to take out and because you don't (51:43 - 51:46)
have leftovers because you're running (51:45 - 51:48)
evo light you'll need some way to (51:46 - 51:50)
recover HP and then ice beam on (51:48 - 51:52)
Thunderbolt are just incredibly good (51:50 - 51:54)
coverage now the ability is the main (51:52 - 51:59)
point of contention in our slack channel (51:54 - 52:00)
which is which is interesting because (51:59 - 52:03)
pretty much everyone does run download (52:00 - 52:09)
although I I do by the arguments of (52:03 - 52:14)
slack user Elma LH Almeida uh who argues (52:09 - 52:18)
that that trace might be a little bit (52:14 - 52:20)
undervalued um I I would probably say (52:18 - 52:24)
that the common consensus that download (52:20 - 52:27)
is better is correct but I also can buy (52:24 - 52:30)
that trace might have some niche use as (52:27 - 52:32)
well so go into what those two abilities (52:30 - 52:34)
do and why download is probably a little (52:32 - 52:37)
bit better but not but why you might run (52:34 - 52:40)
trace conceivably download is an ability (52:37 - 52:45)
where porygon tues or any Pokemon with (52:40 - 52:50)
download their one of their attack stats (52:45 - 52:54)
is going to increase by a stage when (52:50 - 52:56)
they're set out so either attack or (52:54 - 53:00)
special attack and that is determined by (52:56 - 53:05)
whatever your opponent's lowest defense (53:00 - 53:09)
stat is so if your opponent has a lower (53:05 - 53:12)
defense porygon tues attack will (53:09 - 53:14)
increase and similarly if it has a lower (53:12 - 53:17)
special defense it's special attack will (53:14 - 53:18)
increase and now you're not going to get (53:17 - 53:21)
anything out of an attack stat increase (53:18 - 53:22)
because you're not running any physical (53:21 - 53:26)
attacks having that special attack bonus (53:22 - 53:28)
is huge being able to come in with (53:26 - 53:32)
already boosted up a stage you're going (53:28 - 53:34)
to deal a lot of damage and you didn't (53:32 - 53:37)
have to invest any v's into special (53:34 - 53:39)
attacks so you have a whole bunch of (53:37 - 53:41)
bulk you're dealing decent damage and (53:39 - 53:41)
I'm (53:41 - 53:43)
that's the perfect combination right and (53:41 - 53:45)
because your trick room you're also (53:43 - 53:49)
going first so that's pretty devastating (53:45 - 53:51)
it's worth noting that in a double (53:49 - 53:54)
battle download adds the two opposing (53:51 - 53:58)
Pokemon stats to calculate which of the (53:54 - 54:01)
defense stats is lower for determining a (53:58 - 54:04)
which stat of porygon choose to increase (54:01 - 54:08)
trace on the other hand is an ability (54:04 - 54:12)
that copies the opponent's ability as it (54:08 - 54:14)
goes in so it's a similar ability that (54:12 - 54:16)
takes effect as you're sending in (54:14 - 54:19)
porygon too and people don't typically (54:16 - 54:22)
use it over download because one it's a (54:19 - 54:25)
very unpredictable you don't necessarily (54:22 - 54:30)
know what you're gonna copy to you could (54:25 - 54:32)
conceivably copy something bad that's (54:30 - 54:34)
not really gonna happen a lot because (54:32 - 54:36)
there aren't many abilities that are (54:34 - 54:38)
good enough for people to run them but (54:36 - 54:40)
would be so bad for your porygon to to (54:38 - 54:42)
get that it would actually be a (54:40 - 54:45)
detriment to you um but mainly it's just (54:42 - 54:47)
that the number of abilities that are (54:45 - 54:52)
just okay to mediocre to get are (54:47 - 54:56)
numerous and although the number of (54:52 - 54:59)
abilities that are very very great are (54:56 - 55:02)
used fairly often in VGC so that's what (54:59 - 55:04)
you're really aiming for if you're (55:02 - 55:06)
running trace you want to counter (55:04 - 55:09)
something like excuse me you're looking (55:06 - 55:13)
to counter something like a and (55:09 - 55:18)
intimidate or maybe even competitive to (55:13 - 55:20)
counter intimidate or something like (55:18 - 55:25)
that which can be quite powerful because (55:20 - 55:28)
like we mentioned before on earlier (55:25 - 55:30)
episodes Pokemon of the week segments (55:28 - 55:33)
that intimidate and competitive are both (55:30 - 55:37)
incredibly good abilities in VGT so yeah (55:33 - 55:39)
most people aren't going to be running (55:37 - 55:42)
trace in fact according to pcola decks (55:39 - 55:44)
over ninety percent of people use (55:42 - 55:47)
download just because the the negative (55:44 - 55:49)
result of download is kind of just (55:47 - 55:51)
neutral and the positive outcome is very (55:49 - 55:55)
good um there's some argument to be (55:51 - 55:58)
aid to run trace do you think we've (55:55 - 56:01)
covered things well enough folks sound (55:58 - 56:04)
think so good to me so a shiny porygon (56:01 - 56:08)
is blue instead of the pinkish red that (56:04 - 56:11)
it normally is porygon to is the only (56:08 - 56:13)
official Pokemon with a numeral in its (56:11 - 56:16)
name in generation two games it is (56:13 - 56:18)
impossible to return a nickname porygon (56:16 - 56:21)
to to its species name because the (56:18 - 56:23)
character to is not available as a (56:21 - 56:26)
character for nicknames it is the only (56:23 - 56:28)
pokemon that evolves that both evolves (56:26 - 56:30)
by trading and needs to be traded to (56:28 - 56:34)
evolve again porygon 2 is the only (56:30 - 56:36)
pokemon introduced after the generation (56:34 - 56:38)
of Esprit evolution that is able to (56:36 - 56:42)
evolve again like porygon it is based on (56:38 - 56:45)
a bird possibly an origami crane made (56:42 - 56:47)
with more advanced 3d computer graphics (56:45 - 56:49)
and the first porygon its head looks (56:47 - 56:51)
like a duck it also resembles a (56:49 - 56:54)
resembles a drinking bird especially in (56:51 - 56:57)
the 3d games where it makes the same (56:54 - 57:01)
movement as one the change in its form (56:57 - 57:03)
from pouring onto porygon 2 represents (57:01 - 57:06)
the concept of subdivision in 3d (57:03 - 57:08)
computer graphics so there you go poor (57:06 - 57:09)
don't even understand what that means (57:08 - 57:13)
but sure program to is really cool yep (57:09 - 57:14)
the whole poor guideline is really great (57:13 - 57:17)
there's your poking out of the week a (57:14 - 57:19)
little bit of housecleaning real quick (57:17 - 57:22)
if you haven't done so already and you (57:19 - 57:23)
like the show please leave us a review (57:22 - 57:27)
in itunes it helps other people find the (57:23 - 57:29)
show easier if you take a couple seconds (57:27 - 57:32)
to leave us a review we don't have packs (57:29 - 57:35)
coming up but i will be at both midwest (57:32 - 57:39)
gaming classic m c2e2 I in the next (57:35 - 57:42)
couple weeks I will get you more details (57:39 - 57:46)
as we get closer to those events if you (57:42 - 57:48)
like what you hear and you want to (57:46 - 57:49)
support us you can head over to our (57:48 - 57:53)
patreon page patreon.com/lenguin (57:49 - 57:53)
I us on twitter at the travis w can i (58:09 - 58:15)
plug something else too yeah plug away (58:13 - 58:20)
yeah so three weeks ago now with Logan (58:15 - 58:23)
and Greg who y'all would know from (58:20 - 58:25)
either this podcast or mythical the (58:23 - 58:29)
sideshow to this show and also one of (58:25 - 58:32)
our other friends Lee we all started a (58:29 - 58:35)
new RPG podcast called very random (58:32 - 58:38)
encounters and in some ways it's the (58:35 - 58:41)
complete inverse of what a typical (58:38 - 58:43)
role-playing experience is because a (58:41 - 58:45)
role-playing game is supposed to be this (58:43 - 58:47)
power fantasy where you get to be (58:45 - 58:49)
whoever you want to be well we turn that (58:47 - 58:51)
on its head because every single element (58:49 - 58:53)
of the game is randomly determined so (58:51 - 58:58)
our names our classes are races our (58:53 - 59:02)
ability scores everything and also all (58:58 - 59:04)
of the dungeons all of the monsters (59:02 - 59:06)
everything is randomly determined so the (59:04 - 59:10)
characters have very little control over (59:06 - 59:12)
what happens in their lives and it just (59:10 - 59:14)
becomes a bit of a comedy of errors it's (59:12 - 59:16)
a lot of fun unfortunately my (59:14 - 59:19)
character's name is zeg Milne which is (59:16 - 59:22)
not a real thing very random encounters (59:19 - 59:24)
an iTunes could go play all that awesome (59:22 - 59:27)
check that out will is at wash in the (59:24 - 59:30)
sink on twitter i am at dragging a lake (59:27 - 59:32)
