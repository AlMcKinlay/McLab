[Music] (0:13 - 0:20)
what's up everyone welcome to the 577th (0:22 - 0:27)
episode of the Pokemon podcast it's (0:25 - 0:30)
super effective uh this is weird because (0:27 - 0:31)
I feel like I feel like I have to (0:30 - 0:32)
whisper talk because I'm in a hotel but (0:31 - 0:34)
I'm sure it's fine (0:32 - 0:37)
Steve (0:34 - 0:37)
uh with me is Hannah (0:37 - 0:42)
I am not in Japan (0:39 - 0:44)
I'm still here I haven't been playing (0:42 - 0:46)
any of the fun events this week I'm not (0:44 - 0:49)
in Japan I'm not in London (0:46 - 0:51)
but I'm here (0:49 - 0:52)
yeah (0:51 - 0:55)
Bobby's in a different place but also (0:52 - 0:57)
here yep I am also not in Japan but I'm (0:55 - 0:59)
also not in my house (0:57 - 1:01)
so (0:59 - 1:03)
um this is this is early it's I mean (1:01 - 1:06)
early for some people it's 8 A.M and uh (1:03 - 1:08)
I needed to move locations because my (1:06 - 1:10)
kids would be potentially like (1:08 - 1:12)
running through the back of this my (1:10 - 1:16)
typical situation so just popped over to (1:12 - 1:18)
topped over to the in-laws house to (1:16 - 1:20)
record there (1:18 - 1:22)
all right well (1:20 - 1:24)
we'll try to keep this show to an hour (1:22 - 1:27)
uh I'm very tired not because it's (1:24 - 1:29)
midnight you would it's midnight here (1:27 - 1:31)
um you would think like this is my (1:29 - 1:34)
normal time I'm usually busting out work (1:31 - 1:39)
but uh I have played Pokemon go in the (1:34 - 1:41)
hottest weather I have ever played (1:39 - 1:42)
Pokemon go (1:41 - 1:46)
uh but we'll talk about it let's talk (1:42 - 1:48)
about the later half (1:46 - 1:51)
um let's do a uh today's show is really (1:48 - 1:52)
simple we're gonna do a Pokemon sleep (1:51 - 1:54)
check-in uh and then there's gonna be a (1:52 - 1:56)
trailer (1:54 - 1:58)
for something and then we're gonna talk (1:56 - 2:00)
about Osaka (1:58 - 2:01)
um although you guys have probably saw (2:00 - 2:05)
stuff coming out of London out of Osaka (2:01 - 2:09)
that will probably lead into New York (2:05 - 2:12)
uh so I guess we'll talk about that but (2:09 - 2:15)
Hannah give me your Pokemon sleep (2:12 - 2:18)
check-in Greg is not here to Stomp all (2:15 - 2:21)
over our love of Pokemon sleep yeah but (2:18 - 2:22)
I do get to be a little negative this (2:21 - 2:23)
week because this week I've had a few (2:22 - 2:27)
things go wrong oh okay so I am starting (2:23 - 2:29)
to learn that one qualm I have with this (2:27 - 2:32)
app is that when it records your sleep (2:29 - 2:34)
it records it for the night the Sleep (2:32 - 2:36)
started and not the night the Sleep (2:34 - 2:38)
ended if you're sleeping through (2:36 - 2:39)
midnight so Steve you probably haven't (2:38 - 2:43)
even noticed this most of the time (2:39 - 2:46)
but I I think I know what you're saying (2:43 - 2:47)
and I think that doesn't apply to me (2:46 - 2:51)
yeah it records it for the for a (2:47 - 2:53)
different day than any other sleep app (2:51 - 2:55)
records it like if I wake up on a (2:53 - 2:58)
Thursday other sleep apps will say that (2:55 - 2:59)
was (2:58 - 3:02)
Thursday's sleep (2:59 - 3:04)
really but this sleep app will say it's (3:02 - 3:05)
Wednesday's sleep (3:04 - 3:08)
because you started on Wednesday yeah (3:05 - 3:10)
but if you start after midnight it (3:08 - 3:12)
becomes Thursday's sleep yes only after (3:10 - 3:14)
like 3 A.M which I experienced this week (3:12 - 3:17)
because I stayed up too late working (3:14 - 3:18)
huh (3:17 - 3:21)
and then because I stayed up too late (3:18 - 3:23)
and what didn't get very much sleep (3:21 - 3:27)
that sleep was logged for the latter day (3:23 - 3:29)
and then I took a nap because I didn't (3:27 - 3:31)
get enough sleep and then because that (3:29 - 3:34)
was two sleep sessions in that day yep I (3:31 - 3:36)
didn't get to catch any Pokemon the next (3:34 - 3:37)
day (3:36 - 3:38)
it had already been filled up with those (3:37 - 3:40)
two sleep sessions the late sleep and (3:38 - 3:42)
the nap (3:40 - 3:45)
so when you went to sleep on the next (3:42 - 3:48)
night it didn't record like it was like (3:45 - 3:50)
nope sorry you don't get the because I (3:48 - 3:53)
went to sleep before like 3am yeah it's (3:50 - 3:55)
terrible it was not great it made me (3:53 - 3:57)
really sad and my Pokemon are all weak (3:55 - 4:00)
and exhausted because of it (3:57 - 4:02)
you know I thought you would be the best (4:00 - 4:05)
at Pokemon sleep Hannah but wow you get (4:02 - 4:07)
very terrible sleep (4:05 - 4:09)
I could see every day that you are not (4:07 - 4:11)
sleeping very well this is what I said I (4:09 - 4:14)
value sleep very highly I am really bad (4:11 - 4:17)
at it right now the situation I'm in I'm (4:14 - 4:19)
really bad at it right now (4:17 - 4:21)
um I think it's super important (4:19 - 4:23)
but I'm not good (4:21 - 4:24)
um (4:23 - 4:28)
so I tried Pokemon sleep on a plane oh (4:24 - 4:32)
gosh and so I did the Pokeball plus plus (4:28 - 4:36)
the Pikachu song it's All by the plane (4:32 - 4:39)
was so loud no one heard it except me (4:36 - 4:41)
and (4:39 - 4:44)
I paid for internet which was like ten (4:41 - 4:45)
dollars for an hour and I was like okay (4:44 - 4:48)
well I can't fall back to sleep so let (4:45 - 4:50)
me see what happened in the last eight (4:48 - 4:51)
hours (4:50 - 4:54)
and then I tried to sync after I woke up (4:51 - 4:57)
and the app was just struggling to load (4:54 - 5:00)
and it was trying to load the data and (4:57 - 5:02)
then it just got stuck and because the (5:00 - 5:05)
internet was so bad like I bought the (5:02 - 5:07)
premium internet and it was not premium (5:05 - 5:09)
at all so (5:07 - 5:12)
couldn't it it was processing forever I (5:09 - 5:15)
force quit the app and at that point (5:12 - 5:17)
I lost the data because it was trying to (5:15 - 5:18)
pull it (5:17 - 5:22)
but it got stuck so I think it would (5:18 - 5:25)
have worked if the internet (5:22 - 5:27)
could have pulled properly so I don't (5:25 - 5:29)
think that was like (5:27 - 5:31)
I think it's possible to sleep on the (5:29 - 5:33)
plane and have it to work (5:31 - 5:36)
um so I did the thing where I'm a (5:33 - 5:39)
premium member so I get to like go back (5:36 - 5:40)
and (5:39 - 5:43)
um right so I did that that was the (5:40 - 5:46)
first time I did that and you you get (5:43 - 5:48)
your points but you don't get any (5:46 - 5:50)
Pokemon encounters (5:48 - 5:54)
but the second when you actually go to (5:50 - 5:56)
sleep they will give you two premium (5:54 - 5:57)
biscuits (5:56 - 6:00)
they'll say like we we saw that you (5:57 - 6:03)
slept that you recorded but you didn't (6:00 - 6:06)
get any encounters because you manually (6:03 - 6:08)
entered it but we're giving you an extra (6:06 - 6:11)
biscuit to make up for that which is (6:08 - 6:14)
good cool yeah yeah (6:11 - 6:17)
um so (6:14 - 6:17)
yeah it balances uh so this is the first (6:17 - 6:21)
time I used it and I was like okay how's (6:20 - 6:24)
this gonna go (6:21 - 6:24)
um I would say though I still love sleep (6:24 - 6:31)
I'm still super look forward to (6:27 - 6:32)
checking Pokemon (6:31 - 6:37)
and I understand the ingredients stuff (6:32 - 6:40)
more and like the biscuits more and the (6:37 - 6:41)
thing that happened that I thought was (6:40 - 6:43)
gonna happen which is like you're not (6:41 - 6:46)
getting as many points because the 600 (6:43 - 6:48)
bonus Point trial is offer so I I've (6:46 - 6:51)
gone from Catching two Pokemon a day to (6:48 - 6:52)
one (6:51 - 6:55)
so it slowed down there but it didn't (6:52 - 6:58)
ruin my enjoyment at least (6:55 - 7:00)
yeah I mean I'm still really enjoying it (6:58 - 7:02)
I've started spending some of the Sleep (7:00 - 7:04)
points even but I'm not spending any of (7:02 - 7:06)
the diamonds yet because that's a rarer (7:04 - 7:08)
currency and that's the money-based (7:06 - 7:10)
currency but I've started spending some (7:08 - 7:12)
of the Sleep points on the normal (7:10 - 7:14)
Pokeball biscuits so I'm catching (7:12 - 7:17)
usually one Pokemon a day sometimes (7:14 - 7:19)
every other day (7:17 - 7:22)
are you both on premium trial unlike no (7:19 - 7:23)
the (7:22 - 7:26)
okay you're not I'm Steve you are right (7:23 - 7:28)
they charged me fifty dollars I (7:26 - 7:30)
[Laughter] (7:28 - 7:31)
that would be my next question you (7:30 - 7:33)
already answered it thank you uh when (7:31 - 7:37)
when I paid for my airplane internet I (7:33 - 7:40)
then got that push notification that my (7:37 - 7:43)
card was charged (7:40 - 7:46)
uh so check back in six months if that (7:43 - 7:47)
was worth it (7:46 - 7:49)
okay I mean that was gonna be my next (7:47 - 7:51)
question is like having the premium (7:49 - 7:54)
trial for the last uh what is it two (7:51 - 7:56)
weeks well you should know exactly how (7:54 - 7:59)
many days it is now that you got charged (7:56 - 7:59)
um (7:59 - 8:02)
was I was gonna say does that did that (7:59 - 8:04)
make you want to actually (8:02 - 8:06)
pay for it so like did you did you (8:04 - 8:07)
accidentally pay for it or is it where (8:06 - 8:08)
you kind of just like no I'm just gonna (8:07 - 8:10)
pay for it when it when it's up anyways (8:08 - 8:12)
I was probably gonna I was debating of (8:10 - 8:14)
doing the one month or the six months (8:12 - 8:16)
but I genuinely like the game more than (8:14 - 8:18)
I thought I would (8:16 - 8:19)
like (8:18 - 8:22)
I look pretty closely at like the (8:19 - 8:26)
Pokemon I catch and their abilities and (8:22 - 8:28)
um because it's week three I've I've (8:26 - 8:29)
only stayed in the grass area I've (8:28 - 8:31)
unlocked the beach pretty early but I've (8:29 - 8:34)
never moved to it because (8:31 - 8:36)
um (8:34 - 8:38)
I'm still like moving Pokemon around (8:36 - 8:41)
because very early I was like what's the (8:38 - 8:44)
point of changing your team and then you (8:41 - 8:45)
do you see how like deep the game goes (8:44 - 8:47)
of like these Pokemon get these berries (8:45 - 8:48)
and Snorlax wants these berries this (8:47 - 8:51)
week and these two Pokemon work together (8:48 - 8:55)
or this Atkins has like way better (8:51 - 8:58)
abilities than the other reckons I think (8:55 - 9:01)
that all is really cool and it's (8:58 - 9:04)
probably for somebody casual really easy (9:01 - 9:05)
to ignore and they could still enjoy the (9:04 - 9:07)
game (9:05 - 9:10)
um but it has like that depth (9:07 - 9:13)
that I really like (9:10 - 9:15)
and (9:13 - 9:17)
because it limits me I'm like (9:15 - 9:21)
I can't like just burn through it but I (9:17 - 9:23)
want to (9:21 - 9:25)
I guess the ten dollars like (9:23 - 9:28)
a month (9:25 - 9:30)
makes it feel like it's like a little (9:28 - 9:32)
faster where it's not slow enough where (9:30 - 9:35)
I completely fall off because I'm just (9:32 - 9:38)
like everything's taking too long (9:35 - 9:41)
so okay wait if it's ten dollars a month (9:38 - 9:43)
I forget the pricing scheme here if it's (9:41 - 9:44)
ten dollars a month (9:43 - 9:45)
um (9:44 - 9:48)
yep what is the 50 is it fifty dollars a (9:45 - 9:50)
six month situation then yeah you save (9:48 - 9:53)
ten dollars okay and then a year is what (9:50 - 9:55)
a hundred or something you can't do it (9:53 - 9:57)
yeah well yeah you can't do a year well (9:55 - 9:58)
you'd have to do two six months you (9:57 - 9:59)
can't do a year they don't they don't (9:58 - 10:01)
put the they don't want to potentially (9:59 - 10:03)
they're not confident enough in their (10:01 - 10:06)
game to last more than six months to put (10:03 - 10:08)
that annual plan out it may not have (10:06 - 10:10)
just they may just have not wanted to (10:08 - 10:11)
charge a hundred dollars for anything (10:10 - 10:13)
straight up X (10:11 - 10:15)
have they met Niantic because Niantic (10:13 - 10:18)
loves to charge a hundred dollars if (10:15 - 10:19)
they can (10:18 - 10:25)
Pikmin Bloom has a 220 dollar option (10:19 - 10:28)
oh that's awful I will say one thing (10:25 - 10:30)
that a bunch of people in our slack have (10:28 - 10:32)
been running into or at least two maybe (10:30 - 10:34)
three people have been running into is (10:32 - 10:37)
the game crashing and deleting some or (10:34 - 10:39)
all of your data (10:37 - 10:42)
so I will say (10:39 - 10:44)
um maybe link your account in settings (10:42 - 10:47)
there is a place where you can link a (10:44 - 10:49)
Google Apple or Facebook account or you (10:47 - 10:52)
can record a um issue ID (10:49 - 10:55)
maybe just have that as a backup just in (10:52 - 10:56)
case (10:55 - 10:58)
I think that's a really good idea and (10:56 - 11:00)
it's not a default (10:58 - 11:02)
you should have that for go as well yeah (11:00 - 11:05)
yeah go at least you need an account to (11:02 - 11:09)
sign if your go is tied to a school (11:05 - 11:12)
and then maybe in like four years you (11:09 - 11:15)
don't have access to that school email (11:12 - 11:18)
is that common are people do people I've (11:15 - 11:21)
definitely known multiple people really (11:18 - 11:24)
wow yeah no wait that's a good idea for (11:21 - 11:27)
like anything it if you tie don't use (11:24 - 11:29)
your school either don't use a school (11:27 - 11:30)
account or like don't use something (11:29 - 11:31)
that's temporary like especially when (11:30 - 11:33)
it's email that's kind of like when (11:31 - 11:34)
you're going into college you don't (11:33 - 11:36)
always realize your school account is (11:34 - 11:38)
temporary I've known multiple people who (11:36 - 11:39)
didn't realize they weren't going to (11:38 - 11:41)
have access to their college account (11:39 - 11:43)
forever and I think for some schools (11:41 - 11:45)
it's not the same I think some schools (11:43 - 11:48)
do let alumni keep their emails but (11:45 - 11:52)
many of them do not so School accounts (11:48 - 11:55)
can easily disappear yeah I yeah I would (11:52 - 11:58)
definitely recommend in most things in (11:55 - 12:00)
life if it's not related to school just (11:58 - 12:03)
maybe set up a different email address (12:00 - 12:07)
uh Bobby did you do any sleep at all oh (12:03 - 12:11)
I don't sleep in general (12:07 - 12:11)
so this game's not for me (12:11 - 12:18)
um no I uh I tried once I will probably (12:14 - 12:21)
try it again but I I this game is not (12:18 - 12:23)
for me it really isn't like I do love it (12:21 - 12:25)
like I do love seeing all the (12:23 - 12:27)
screenshots and hearing people people (12:25 - 12:29)
talk about it and stuff but the way that (12:27 - 12:31)
I sleep which sounds really weird like (12:29 - 12:33)
I'm not like a I'm not a weird sleeper (12:31 - 12:36)
but I just I don't like (12:33 - 12:38)
okay so here's here's a little bit (12:36 - 12:39)
information about me (12:38 - 12:41)
um and Steve you know this because you (12:39 - 12:43)
see me I we I'm texting you at like (12:41 - 12:45)
three o'clock in the morning my time you (12:43 - 12:46)
know so (12:45 - 12:49)
um but I sleep very little and I sleep (12:46 - 12:53)
like I go to sleep when I'm falling (12:49 - 12:56)
asleep doing something like I don't like (12:53 - 12:58)
I'm not a big fan of like (12:56 - 13:01)
going and laying in bed and then like (12:58 - 13:03)
you know waiting to fall asleep I'm (13:01 - 13:05)
typically like I'm falling asleep now (13:03 - 13:07)
doing what I'm doing I'm gonna like (13:05 - 13:10)
halfway be awake roll into my bed and (13:07 - 13:13)
then just pass out and (13:10 - 13:15)
that is most that's most evenings for me (13:13 - 13:18)
or mornings I guess (13:15 - 13:19)
um and so (13:18 - 13:23)
for one like I'm not gonna remember to (13:19 - 13:26)
turn the lullaby thing on or whatever (13:23 - 13:28)
and do that whole thing (13:26 - 13:30)
um kind of look forward to the lullaby (13:28 - 13:33)
every night I'm gonna do it but like but (13:30 - 13:35)
maybe you can change the lullaby there (13:33 - 13:38)
are different lullabies oh that's what (13:35 - 13:40)
I mean that's cool but yeah in the plus (13:38 - 13:43)
plus settings wow you just introduced a (13:40 - 13:46)
whole new concept of Steve yeah this is (13:43 - 13:48)
he's gonna end the podcast now I need to (13:46 - 13:52)
sleep right now India's lullaby (13:48 - 13:53)
um (13:52 - 13:56)
uh yeah and also like I have two kids (13:53 - 13:58)
and my wife who are all asleep by the (13:56 - 14:00)
time that I go to sleep and that lullaby (13:58 - 14:02)
when people are asleep that lullaby (14:00 - 14:05)
feels like it's the loudest thing in the (14:02 - 14:07)
world you can mute it you can turn the (14:05 - 14:09)
sounds off yeah I should definitely do (14:07 - 14:10)
that (14:09 - 14:13)
um but no also okay so but I did try (14:10 - 14:14)
sleep (14:13 - 14:17)
once and I actually got eight hours of (14:14 - 14:20)
sleep like I shocked myself that like I (14:17 - 14:22)
was like okay I'm kind of tired I'm (14:20 - 14:24)
gonna go to bed I'll try this (14:22 - 14:24)
um (14:24 - 14:27)
got eight hours of sleep but (14:24 - 14:31)
at about six hours into my sleep (14:27 - 14:35)
I was slightly awoken by the lullaby (14:31 - 14:38)
which was like uh oh like something went (14:35 - 14:42)
wrong with the go plus plus because I (14:38 - 14:44)
had like I clicked it lullaby went I was (14:42 - 14:46)
that was good (14:44 - 14:48)
and then the next morning I like was I (14:46 - 14:51)
woke up to the lullaby and I was like uh (14:48 - 14:53)
something definitely went wrong and so (14:51 - 14:55)
kind of fell back asleep woke up at my (14:53 - 14:56)
normal time and it was like you slept (14:55 - 14:59)
for 45 minutes (14:56 - 15:04)
yeah like so who knows I bumped it or (14:59 - 15:05)
something bumped the go plus plus at (15:04 - 15:08)
night or something happened with it but (15:05 - 15:10)
um it still like gave me stuff like (15:08 - 15:11)
because I thought you had to sleep for (15:10 - 15:14)
at least 90 minutes for it to record (15:11 - 15:17)
like to work you have to record for at (15:14 - 15:20)
least 90 minutes it doesn't count all of (15:17 - 15:21)
that as sleep but because it's a bad (15:20 - 15:24)
sleep tracker that's not always accurate (15:21 - 15:26)
okay got it because so that's that's (15:24 - 15:28)
what happened then I must have been I (15:26 - 15:29)
must have recorded like two hours of (15:28 - 15:32)
sleep or like you know over 90 minutes (15:29 - 15:34)
but it said like 45 minutes of sleep (15:32 - 15:35)
um (15:34 - 15:37)
and so that like that was the immediate (15:35 - 15:40)
like okay like I'm already like not (15:37 - 15:42)
happy with this app and it's been one (15:40 - 15:44)
like it's been one time of using it you (15:42 - 15:45)
know (15:44 - 15:46)
um (15:45 - 15:48)
but I don't know I guess at the end of (15:46 - 15:49)
the day like it did the thing it's (15:48 - 15:51)
supposed to do like I slept more than I (15:49 - 15:54)
had slept in the last like five years (15:51 - 15:57)
that night so (15:54 - 15:59)
um I'll try it again I will try it again (15:57 - 16:01)
because I do it is like seeing everybody (15:59 - 16:03)
playing it and like seeing the (16:01 - 16:06)
screenshots on like social media and (16:03 - 16:08)
things like that it's like oh that seems (16:06 - 16:09)
cool (16:08 - 16:12)
um but first I kind of gotta fix my (16:09 - 16:14)
sleep schedule before I can really dive (16:12 - 16:16)
into it so (16:14 - 16:18)
um so that's where I'm at with it but it (16:16 - 16:19)
seems fun I'm happy to hear you guys (16:18 - 16:21)
talk about it (16:19 - 16:24)
the one maybe I said this last week but (16:21 - 16:25)
I think the one thing that I really like (16:24 - 16:28)
for me personally is (16:25 - 16:30)
I like that (16:28 - 16:33)
the app is engaging enough to make me (16:30 - 16:36)
wake up like (16:33 - 16:40)
I uh I'm definitely like the set five (16:36 - 16:41)
alarms (16:40 - 16:44)
turn off the first Force snooze the last (16:41 - 16:46)
one like five times (16:44 - 16:49)
um but and I try to myself personally I (16:46 - 16:51)
will try to schedule appointments early (16:49 - 16:53)
in the morning to like get me out of bed (16:51 - 16:54)
and start me for the day because (16:53 - 16:56)
otherwise I'll just like work all night (16:54 - 16:58)
and then just sleep until I'm (16:56 - 16:59)
excited (16:58 - 17:03)
so I have definitely woken up like (16:59 - 17:06)
checked Twitter checked Instagram check (17:03 - 17:08)
emails and then just go back to bed (17:06 - 17:11)
and now when I check (17:08 - 17:14)
sleep I feel like I'm doing so much that (17:11 - 17:16)
at the end of that like I don't know (17:14 - 17:19)
like six seven minutes with the app I'm (17:16 - 17:23)
like pretty fully awake for the day (17:19 - 17:27)
okay enough about sleep we'll shift (17:23 - 17:30)
gears over to the Miss let me pull up (17:27 - 17:31)
the press release it's like two (17:30 - 17:33)
sentences (17:31 - 17:35)
um (17:33 - 17:38)
tune in on August 8th for all new (17:35 - 17:41)
Pokemon presents I think this was (17:38 - 17:45)
rumored on some yeah website for a while (17:41 - 17:47)
it's been rumored all over don't know (17:45 - 17:49)
where it came from (17:47 - 17:49)
my uncle's cousin's dog first started (17:50 - 17:54)
this rumor (17:53 - 17:56)
um the Pokemon company International is (17:54 - 17:57)
inviting fans around the world to tune (17:56 - 17:59)
into a special Pokemon presents (17:57 - 18:03)
streaming August 8th 6 a.m PDT (17:59 - 18:05)
uh fans can look forward to a half an (18:03 - 18:08)
hour of Pokemon news and a spotlight on (18:05 - 18:09)
the latest happenings across the brand (18:08 - 18:13)
here's a teaser that's the whole press (18:09 - 18:15)
release (18:13 - 18:17)
um for those that didn't see the teaser (18:15 - 18:20)
uh you're not missing much uh (18:17 - 18:24)
guns yeah it's a couple seconds and I (18:20 - 18:25)
guess the most interesting thing there's (18:24 - 18:31)
two things there's uh an M that appears (18:25 - 18:34)
uh and then the Pokemon presents is (18:31 - 18:37)
normally like this white blue yellow (18:34 - 18:40)
logo that they use with like Pikachu (18:37 - 18:44)
ears and in this trailer it's a purple (18:40 - 18:46)
neon version of that (18:44 - 18:48)
which (18:46 - 18:50)
there's probably one time where they (18:48 - 18:53)
slightly changed it but (18:50 - 18:55)
I feel like it's always been the white (18:53 - 18:59)
blue yellow standard logo so yeah that (18:55 - 19:01)
definitely stands out (18:59 - 19:03)
does it and the M that appears is the m (19:01 - 19:06)
from Pokemon so it is also neon purple (19:03 - 19:08)
it just appears for just a moment and (19:06 - 19:10)
then disappears and then the full logo (19:08 - 19:14)
appears yeah I couldn't get like a (19:10 - 19:15)
um I was trying to like I was I wasn't (19:14 - 19:17)
like I didn't look up uh any articles to (19:15 - 19:19)
see about it I was just looking at the (19:17 - 19:20)
trailer and like trying to get this (19:19 - 19:23)
pause it on the like is the m the same (19:20 - 19:26)
exact M or is there some other like is (19:23 - 19:28)
it some other design in some way I am (19:26 - 19:29)
pretty certain I looked specifically for (19:28 - 19:31)
it I'm pretty certain it's the same (19:29 - 19:32)
exact time in the same place and (19:31 - 19:35)
everything interesting I feel like the (19:32 - 19:37)
colors kind of remind me of (19:35 - 19:41)
of detective Pikachu like in the way (19:37 - 19:42)
that they (19:41 - 19:45)
do that you know that was kind of what (19:42 - 19:48)
the neon was their whole neon yeah (19:45 - 19:51)
uh can I complain it's my show I can (19:48 - 19:54)
complain how (19:51 - 19:54)
so the this this thing came out at like (19:57 - 20:03)
10 p.m Japan time right (20:03 - 20:09)
so I like saw it I made like a little (20:06 - 20:12)
like Instagram hey the news is coming (20:09 - 20:15)
post and then I went to bed (20:12 - 20:18)
and I woke up to people being like I (20:15 - 20:23)
hope they announced Gen 5 remakes (20:18 - 20:23)
I just (20:23 - 20:28)
yeah yeah (20:25 - 20:28)
can we dissect this for a second (20:28 - 20:36)
for years people have been complaining (20:32 - 20:39)
that Pokemon games are rushed (20:36 - 20:41)
and they need to take more time (20:39 - 20:44)
and our current game is Pokemon Scarlet (20:41 - 20:48)
Violet which is not even (20:44 - 20:51)
10 months old and they have announced (20:48 - 20:56)
DLC that we speculate That was supposed (20:51 - 20:58)
to be delayed (20:56 - 21:02)
because some are base DLC coming out in (20:58 - 21:06)
the fall does not line up with anything (21:02 - 21:06)
and in 10 months (21:07 - 21:12)
without even new DLC coming out we're (21:10 - 21:16)
just jumping because of a neon sign (21:12 - 21:20)
flashing to black and white remakes well (21:16 - 21:23)
when did Black and White come out (21:20 - 21:23)
10 right 2000 wasn't it 2010. (21:24 - 21:32)
I have 11 about 1000 years ago yeah okay (21:29 - 21:34)
so they've had 12 years to work on the (21:32 - 21:36)
remix (21:34 - 21:39)
what are they doing that when you are (21:36 - 21:41)
someone whose home region like you're (21:39 - 21:42)
you're the the region you are the most (21:41 - 21:45)
connected to is up for a remake next you (21:42 - 21:48)
want that soon you want that now so I (21:45 - 21:51)
don't blame those people as much even if (21:48 - 21:55)
it doesn't quite make sense (21:51 - 21:55)
most remakes need like three to four (21:55 - 22:01)
years in between yeah no I mean to take (21:58 - 22:03)
time that's because they they fill it in (22:01 - 22:05)
with like (22:03 - 22:08)
main series and then like super main (22:05 - 22:11)
series which DLC has ultimately replaced (22:08 - 22:13)
that but (22:11 - 22:13)
we (22:14 - 22:16)
brilliant diamond shine Pearl which for (22:17 - 22:21)
the record is a bad game oh absolutely (22:19 - 22:24)
literally three months later we got (22:21 - 22:26)
another Pokemon game (22:24 - 22:28)
and then not even a year later we got (22:26 - 22:30)
Scarlet violet (22:28 - 22:33)
and we have DLC coming now to the people (22:30 - 22:34)
are like well what else would they (22:33 - 22:37)
announce I don't know maybe detective (22:34 - 22:40)
Pikachu (22:37 - 22:40)
which I think the neon sign looks like (22:40 - 22:48)
detective Pikachu (22:45 - 22:48)
I don't know maybe it's a stretch I mean (22:50 - 22:53)
30 (22:52 - 22:56)
a lot to just focus on the movie clearly (22:53 - 22:58)
there's gonna be other small stuff maybe (22:56 - 22:59)
we're going to learn more about the DLC (22:58 - 23:01)
but I don't think we should expect (22:59 - 23:03)
anything (23:01 - 23:04)
huge (23:03 - 23:08)
in regards to the main Series games (23:04 - 23:12)
yeah I think DLC was what we would learn (23:08 - 23:14)
more about I mean (23:12 - 23:15)
um sure the neon doesn't really line up (23:14 - 23:17)
with like with the first DLC or the (23:15 - 23:18)
second DLC (23:17 - 23:21)
um or the second part looks like but I (23:18 - 23:23)
don't I mean it makes sense right like (23:21 - 23:25)
we know it's coming in fall and it's now (23:23 - 23:28)
summer and they haven't given us a whole (23:25 - 23:30)
lot of details so (23:28 - 23:34)
uh so that just makes sense (23:30 - 23:35)
um (23:34 - 23:37)
I I feel like that's going to be a (23:35 - 23:38)
majority of what we're going to learn (23:37 - 23:41)
during this (23:38 - 23:44)
during this presents is about the DLC I (23:41 - 23:46)
mean 30 minutes is a long time and I (23:44 - 23:47)
don't think they want to show off that (23:46 - 23:49)
much more of the DLC I'm not getting (23:47 - 23:51)
that feeling but then they might show (23:49 - 23:54)
off some oh well they they do love (23:51 - 23:56)
showing off the same trailer we've seen (23:54 - 23:57)
a million times but they'll like add an (23:56 - 24:00)
extra slightly to five seconds yeah (23:57 - 24:06)
like We snuck in a venonat I'm excited (24:00 - 24:06)
we also know that this company is very (24:06 - 24:10)
good at like (24:08 - 24:13)
hyping themselves up of like do you (24:10 - 24:16)
remember Charizard (24:13 - 24:18)
he's cool (24:16 - 24:21)
here's five minutes on him (24:18 - 24:24)
um here here's what I (24:21 - 24:27)
think and I thought this was gonna (24:24 - 24:29)
happen regardless of this Pokemon (24:27 - 24:30)
presents (24:29 - 24:32)
sometimes (24:30 - 24:35)
they line a lot of stuff up so a really (24:32 - 24:37)
good example that I don't think a lot of (24:35 - 24:40)
Pokemon fans like noticed is the first (24:37 - 24:43)
time they did a Riolu hatch day in (24:40 - 24:46)
Pokemon go which people complained about (24:43 - 24:48)
that like Riolu was still impossible to (24:46 - 24:49)
get (24:48 - 24:54)
um was the same weekend that Ash got a (24:49 - 24:59)
Riolu in Pokemon Journeys so there are (24:54 - 25:02)
things that line up right like whether (24:59 - 25:05)
or not like if you never watch Journeys (25:02 - 25:07)
you wouldn't have known that also it was (25:05 - 25:08)
based on the (25:07 - 25:11)
Japanese debut of Journeys so right (25:08 - 25:14)
American fans would miss that too (25:11 - 25:17)
we're in like this situation where (25:14 - 25:19)
we know that Mewtwo is coming to scarlet (25:17 - 25:22)
and violet we know another Mewtwo is (25:19 - 25:24)
coming to unite (25:22 - 25:28)
uh we know that Mewtwo is in detective (25:24 - 25:30)
Pikachu (25:28 - 25:32)
um now that mega Rayquaza is in Pokemon (25:30 - 25:33)
go (25:32 - 25:35)
they showed Mega Mewtwo in the (25:33 - 25:38)
promotional materials for Pokemon go (25:35 - 25:40)
we like (25:38 - 25:43)
and out of all the letters the M pops up (25:40 - 25:46)
yeah no it's it's I mean they would have (25:43 - 25:48)
chosen I don't know the purple neon is (25:46 - 25:50)
pretty on theme for detective Pikachu I (25:48 - 25:52)
think it feels like the movie but also (25:50 - 25:55)
that's Mewtwo's psychic color (25:52 - 25:59)
yeah yeah the and the um this I would (25:55 - 26:01)
not be surprised if that is correct if (25:59 - 26:03)
this is just a Mewtwo presence you don't (26:01 - 26:04)
think they're showing them off for (26:03 - 26:05)
Meowstic (26:04 - 26:07)
[Music] (26:05 - 26:09)
no (26:07 - 26:16)
psychic for everyone this week got me (26:09 - 26:17)
yeah I think it's I think it's very (26:16 - 26:20)
possible that this is like (26:17 - 26:23)
here's the same DLC trailer you've seen (26:20 - 26:26)
um we've added 10 extra seconds and now (26:23 - 26:29)
here's the date (26:26 - 26:30)
um and that's what like (26:29 - 26:34)
two minutes but we've seen a minute 50 (26:30 - 26:39)
of what has already existed here's (26:34 - 26:42)
us bragging about how Pokemon unite has (26:39 - 26:45)
been downloaded four billion times and (26:42 - 26:48)
uh Mewtwo like we have 1v2 and here's (26:45 - 26:52)
another Mewtwo here's a recap of (26:48 - 26:54)
Pokemon go Fest (26:52 - 26:57)
but also like the worldwide one is (26:54 - 26:58)
coming (26:57 - 27:02)
here is Pokemon cafe mix we're adding (26:58 - 27:05)
Mewtwo hey there's a (27:02 - 27:07)
I actually think Mewtwo's already in (27:05 - 27:10)
Cafe mix (27:07 - 27:10)
like it's so easy for them to waste time (27:11 - 27:19)
and not spend 30 even even if you were (27:16 - 27:21)
like okay they're they're (27:19 - 27:25)
they're actually remaking Johto but (27:21 - 27:26)
instead of going back to Kanto you're (27:25 - 27:28)
going back to you Nova even if they were (27:26 - 27:32)
doing that which ain't happening that's (27:28 - 27:33)
not 30 minutes (27:32 - 27:36)
like when they show no brilliant Diamond (27:33 - 27:38)
shining Pearl for the first time that (27:36 - 27:41)
was like 14 seconds and everyone was (27:38 - 27:43)
like why is it why are they Duplo blocks (27:41 - 27:46)
like why are they Duplo people (27:43 - 27:49)
why is the ground so shiny if the Niche (27:46 - 27:51)
to line this all up with all of the (27:49 - 27:52)
Mewtwo things I will be extremely (27:51 - 27:55)
impressed (27:52 - 27:55)
I yeah so I think okay so I think that (27:56 - 28:01)
they're gonna (27:59 - 28:02)
um but they do in the I feel like what (28:01 - 28:04)
they've done in the past right is with (28:02 - 28:06)
the main Series games they'll do a (28:04 - 28:10)
trailer and then they'll like say hey (28:06 - 28:11)
now we have a little bit more to talk (28:10 - 28:14)
about like with that and I I sort of (28:11 - 28:16)
feel like with the DLC there's a chance (28:14 - 28:18)
that they do the trailer and then they (28:16 - 28:20)
talk for a few minutes about like (28:18 - 28:23)
potential new things new features within (28:20 - 28:27)
the DLC and it may combine it may (28:23 - 28:28)
combine both parts I mean they may talk (28:27 - 28:31)
about both parts of the DLC but I really (28:28 - 28:32)
do think that there's going to be a (28:31 - 28:35)
little a little bit more time given to (28:32 - 28:38)
the DLC than just a trailer (28:35 - 28:40)
um I think there might be a few minutes (28:38 - 28:42)
of like here's what you can expect here (28:40 - 28:44)
because like you said it's a summer (28:42 - 28:46)
themed DLC it's coming out in the fall (28:44 - 28:48)
but I think they really want to Hype (28:46 - 28:50)
people up for it during summer since (28:48 - 28:52)
it's clearly when it was supposed to (28:50 - 28:55)
come out like initially I I don't think (28:52 - 28:57)
they want this like hey trainers do you (28:55 - 28:59)
remember summer and it's fall now don't (28:57 - 29:01)
you wish it was summer again like play (28:59 - 29:04)
this game you know like I really think (29:01 - 29:05)
they're gonna hype it up a little bit (29:04 - 29:06)
more (29:05 - 29:09)
um and so I'm not saying the whole (29:06 - 29:10)
presents is going to be the DLC but I (29:09 - 29:11)
really do think they're going to do a (29:10 - 29:13)
trailer and then they're gonna say like (29:11 - 29:15)
and here's some additional features (29:13 - 29:18)
about what is going to be in the DLC not (29:15 - 29:20)
Story related but just like kind of (29:18 - 29:21)
things you're gonna come across (29:20 - 29:23)
potentially or features you may come (29:21 - 29:24)
across (29:23 - 29:25)
um (29:24 - 29:26)
and then everything else I think they (29:25 - 29:29)
can tie together but I I do think that (29:26 - 29:30)
will be (29:29 - 29:32)
kind of a main focus of the presents (29:30 - 29:34)
still (29:32 - 29:36)
and it doesn't even have to be like game (29:34 - 29:40)
related they can also talk about the TCG (29:36 - 29:40)
true (29:40 - 29:44)
they could talk about 151 actually about (29:42 - 29:47)
uh Scarlet Violet 151 if they go TCG (29:44 - 29:50)
you're out just because people love gen (29:47 - 29:53)
1 and this is our special set and it (29:50 - 29:55)
comes out in September so yeah I was (29:53 - 29:56)
gonna say it could pretty soon they (29:55 - 29:58)
could talk about that I guess (29:56 - 30:01)
well they canceled Opening Ceremonies (29:58 - 30:05)
for for worlds and (30:01 - 30:07)
so normally for those that don't follow (30:05 - 30:09)
like when you go to Worlds there's (30:07 - 30:11)
usually like this huge video package (30:09 - 30:13)
that happens and then they'll announce (30:11 - 30:16)
something like one world they I think (30:13 - 30:19)
they announced like a mega form another (30:16 - 30:21)
world they announced brawler for the (30:19 - 30:22)
first time they're like we got a new (30:21 - 30:23)
Pokemon to show you it's from brawler (30:22 - 30:25)
and then (30:23 - 30:28)
um leading to sword and shield they (30:25 - 30:30)
announced (30:28 - 30:31)
um (30:30 - 30:34)
they gave like early preview of (30:31 - 30:36)
um to a certain Shield like zashi and (30:34 - 30:39)
zamasenta they like showed off those (30:36 - 30:40)
cards but we didn't know what types they (30:39 - 30:42)
were and then they did the same thing (30:40 - 30:45)
for the worlds right before scarlet and (30:42 - 30:46)
violet they showed Off Mariah and (30:45 - 30:48)
karidon but we were like what types are (30:46 - 30:49)
they (30:48 - 30:51)
um they showed off room service they (30:49 - 30:53)
showed off like (30:51 - 30:55)
for sword and shield they showed off (30:53 - 30:58)
Dynamax and how you couldn't Flinch them (30:55 - 31:01)
so like opening ceremonies have (30:58 - 31:03)
given like (31:01 - 31:07)
some game stuff so the fact that this is (31:03 - 31:10)
coming out August 8th and there's no (31:07 - 31:13)
opening ceremony makes me think (31:10 - 31:16)
that it's because they wanted (31:13 - 31:18)
it's because they wanted like a bigger (31:16 - 31:20)
package (31:18 - 31:25)
that wasn't like (31:20 - 31:25)
I don't know openings I don't think the (31:25 - 31:29)
opening ceremony was bad but it could be (31:27 - 31:32)
just like what if we separate this out (31:29 - 31:35)
and it will get more press (31:32 - 31:38)
in a presents format versus like (31:35 - 31:40)
this is just some tournament happening (31:38 - 31:42)
there's no news come but there is news (31:40 - 31:44)
coming from it but like Outlets might (31:42 - 31:47)
not see that (31:44 - 31:47)
yeah (31:48 - 31:51)
it's a very exciting thing to be there (31:48 - 31:53)
for the opening ceremonies when that (31:51 - 31:54)
kind of thing happens but if they (31:53 - 31:56)
release it at a time that is better for (31:54 - 31:59)
press that makes sense (31:56 - 32:03)
as somebody who's gone to Worlds uh I've (31:59 - 32:05)
almost missed every opening ceremony (32:03 - 32:07)
because there's always some huge line (32:05 - 32:09)
like when I went to Worlds with Hannah (32:07 - 32:11)
when we met for the first time and she (32:09 - 32:14)
traded me a Tropius we almost didn't get (32:11 - 32:16)
into the convention center because they (32:14 - 32:18)
were like we gotta go through security (32:16 - 32:20)
so it's like the opening ceremony is (32:18 - 32:22)
happening and there's still 2 000 people (32:20 - 32:25)
outside like getting their bag checked (32:22 - 32:27)
we were definitely in there for it I (32:25 - 32:28)
think that this world is going to be (32:27 - 32:30)
going to be a little bit (32:28 - 32:32)
a little more crowded but the one we (32:30 - 32:34)
were at wasn't that bad (32:32 - 32:38)
that was DC yeah yeah (32:34 - 32:39)
was that 2019 (32:38 - 32:42)
oh boy time is up (32:39 - 32:45)
it was the one pre-pandemic that's how I (32:42 - 32:48)
remember yes that time (32:45 - 32:49)
well if you're watching the video (32:48 - 32:51)
version of this podcast this is hotel (32:49 - 32:53)
room number one find out next week what (32:51 - 32:56)
hotel room number two will look like and (32:53 - 32:59)
I will be talking about if the world (32:56 - 33:03)
championship was a disaster or not (32:59 - 33:03)
um oh last thing I want to say before we (33:04 - 33:08)
take a break is going back to Bobby with (33:05 - 33:10)
the summer DLC (33:08 - 33:14)
at the 70s is it it's I think it's Expo (33:10 - 33:17)
70s park or 70s Expo Park anyways the (33:14 - 33:21)
park where the Osaka go Fest was they (33:17 - 33:24)
had a roped off part (33:21 - 33:25)
I don't want to say in the middle of the (33:24 - 33:27)
park because the park is huge (33:25 - 33:29)
um but they had a park that was (33:27 - 33:31)
designated for a festival (33:29 - 33:34)
and there was a bunch of tables there (33:31 - 33:35)
was a bunch of chairs and everything it (33:34 - 33:37)
was like a really really big space and (33:35 - 33:40)
then in that space was these huge (33:37 - 33:41)
um (33:40 - 33:44)
I don't know they they held the masks so (33:41 - 33:47)
if you remember the masks in the DLC (33:44 - 33:48)
trailer they were just all lined with (33:47 - 33:51)
masks they had Pikachu they had power (33:48 - 33:53)
rangers they had a Mickey Mouse mask and (33:51 - 33:55)
it was like (33:53 - 33:58)
this is the this this is a Summer (33:55 - 34:02)
Festival IRL with the masks in the park (33:58 - 34:06)
where go Fest is happening like (34:02 - 34:09)
you cannot convince me that this DLC (34:06 - 34:11)
wasn't coming out in the summer and they (34:09 - 34:13)
delayed it because Scarlet Violet is (34:11 - 34:16)
such a mess yeah I'm pretty sure there (34:13 - 34:18)
was a video that I saw was it last night (34:16 - 34:19)
maybe (34:18 - 34:22)
of one of the three (34:19 - 34:24)
I can't I don't remember the name of the (34:22 - 34:25)
three the names of the three Pokemon (34:24 - 34:28)
that are part of the summer DLC (34:25 - 34:30)
that are the ones with the one's a (34:28 - 34:32)
monkey one okey dokey Dory and (34:30 - 34:36)
Serendipity pheasants (34:32 - 34:39)
wasn't there wasn't there one that's a (34:36 - 34:41)
dog though isn't there like oh yeah over (34:39 - 34:44)
over doji oh okay something like that (34:41 - 34:46)
okay well there was a (34:44 - 34:48)
there was something happening where (34:46 - 34:51)
someone was carrying that like that mask (34:48 - 34:53)
around or like they were carrying some (34:51 - 34:54)
kind of (34:53 - 34:56)
they were had they were holding (34:54 - 34:57)
something (34:56 - 34:59)
um and it was that Pokemon and they were (34:57 - 35:01)
walking around and it was like it looked (34:59 - 35:02)
like it was part of some kind of (35:01 - 35:05)
festival or some kind of parade or (35:02 - 35:06)
something (35:05 - 35:08)
and I saw this clip like last night I (35:06 - 35:10)
think it was like for the night before (35:08 - 35:12)
last I feel like I know what you're (35:10 - 35:14)
talking about (35:12 - 35:14)
but I don't remember I'm also very tired (35:15 - 35:20)
but I think I know okay I don't know if (35:17 - 35:21)
it was if it was at the park or (35:20 - 35:23)
something or if it was really related in (35:21 - 35:24)
any way to that but I just remember like (35:23 - 35:27)
there was someone (35:24 - 35:29)
um I don't know how to explain what it (35:27 - 35:30)
was like it's almost like if you took (35:29 - 35:32)
like um you know those people this is (35:30 - 35:35)
weird you know those people who like uh (35:32 - 35:37)
I don't know what the thing is called (35:35 - 35:38)
where you would put people or you put (35:37 - 35:39)
something in the back of it and it's got (35:38 - 35:41)
two wheels on it and then you hold yes (35:39 - 35:44)
the front wheel bearing like walk what's (35:41 - 35:47)
it called a wheelbarrow well not yes I (35:44 - 35:48)
know what wheelbarrow is but I'm talking (35:47 - 35:51)
about like uh reverse that so like (35:48 - 35:52)
you're walking in front of whatever (35:51 - 35:54)
you're carrying and then you have the (35:52 - 35:56)
you're holding (35:54 - 35:59)
sure like a carriage anyways someone had (35:56 - 36:01)
something and it was made up of one of (35:59 - 36:03)
those Pokemon and they were noting they (36:01 - 36:04)
were like oh someone they're like (36:03 - 36:05)
there's like a festival there's like a (36:04 - 36:07)
parade happening with (36:05 - 36:09)
with those Pokemon from the summer DLC (36:07 - 36:11)
so I didn't I wasn't sure if that was a (36:09 - 36:13)
part of what you were what you're taught (36:11 - 36:15)
like of the park or (36:13 - 36:17)
um a part of something but it definitely (36:15 - 36:19)
seemed like they were hyping up a (36:17 - 36:21)
World's promotion was it a world yeah I (36:19 - 36:23)
mean again I just seemed like they were (36:21 - 36:25)
hyping up the summer DLC (36:23 - 36:28)
um or the fall deals or whatever the DLC (36:25 - 36:30)
is supposed to be but the summer party (36:28 - 36:34)
it's a summer DLC at heart yeah (36:30 - 36:37)
okay well speaking of Summer uh (36:34 - 36:42)
I spent three days in the 70s Expo Park (36:37 - 36:46)
and it was mostly miserable man I will (36:42 - 36:49)
tell you about that after the break we (36:46 - 36:51)
will be right back (36:49 - 36:55)
and we are back okay (36:51 - 36:58)
I have full disclosure Niantic did pay (36:55 - 37:03)
for my three day ticket that passed (36:58 - 37:04)
um they gave me the add-on bonuses the (37:03 - 37:06)
egg lover the (37:04 - 37:08)
they should be called the egg scammer (37:06 - 37:12)
The Raid lover (37:08 - 37:14)
um which I actually think is 100 worth (37:12 - 37:15)
it I think that one's actually really (37:14 - 37:17)
good (37:15 - 37:19)
um they did not give me the shirt (37:17 - 37:22)
and shirts sold out that was my bad (37:19 - 37:23)
are they sure it's the same color in (37:22 - 37:25)
person (37:23 - 37:27)
yes cool I thought they were supposed to (37:25 - 37:30)
be different I thought so too they were (37:27 - 37:35)
last year weren't they they were yeah (37:30 - 37:35)
sure it's a good color so it is it's the (37:35 - 37:40)
design is too low though yeah right (37:38 - 37:45)
right but good color for sure so yeah (37:40 - 37:48)
um I've been to like every go Fest uh (37:45 - 37:50)
I've been to all the US ones I will be (37:48 - 37:54)
missing New York I've been to the Berlin (37:50 - 37:57)
one last year I've been to many Safari (37:54 - 38:01)
zones so I feel like I have a good (37:57 - 38:04)
gauge of what a Niantic event is at this (38:01 - 38:06)
point (38:04 - 38:09)
again they did not pay for my hotel well (38:06 - 38:11)
they maybe will pay for my hotel I will (38:09 - 38:14)
legally disclose to the FTC if they do (38:11 - 38:17)
pay for my hotel uh as of right now I (38:14 - 38:19)
paid for my hotel they did not pay for (38:17 - 38:21)
my flight uh they did give me the (38:19 - 38:24)
three-day pass my pass was unique (38:21 - 38:26)
um it worked in the Park the entire time (38:24 - 38:30)
but the concept is you either pick (38:26 - 38:33)
Saturday Sunday Friday Saturday Sunday (38:30 - 38:34)
and then you either pick morning or (38:33 - 38:35)
afternoon (38:34 - 38:38)
and then the reverses you play in the (38:35 - 38:39)
city (38:38 - 38:42)
and you can add on (38:39 - 38:45)
the extra days to play in the city (38:42 - 38:46)
um (38:45 - 38:49)
so the (38:46 - 38:52)
70s Expo Park was 40 minutes from my (38:49 - 38:54)
hotel through train (38:52 - 38:59)
only one transfer so 30 minutes north on (38:54 - 39:02)
the red line and then there's a monorail (38:59 - 39:05)
that runs that way and then 10 minutes (39:02 - 39:08)
on the monorail to get to the park fun (39:05 - 39:10)
fact about this park uh it only had one (39:08 - 39:12)
entrance (39:10 - 39:14)
and well if you were going by public (39:12 - 39:17)
transportation it was only that monorail (39:14 - 39:20)
uh so it was supposed to be any other (39:17 - 39:22)
country (39:20 - 39:23)
seriously (39:22 - 39:25)
if there was any other country I would (39:23 - 39:27)
be concerned but Japan is very efficient (39:25 - 39:29)
they were prepared for it they had way (39:27 - 39:31)
more trains running both Apple and (39:29 - 39:33)
Google Maps were like we're running way (39:31 - 39:35)
more trains when you check it (39:33 - 39:40)
um so that wasn't bad at all (39:35 - 39:40)
um (39:40 - 39:42)
they did (39:40 - 39:45)
the park itself was fenced (39:42 - 39:48)
which we know that Niantic is not good (39:45 - 39:50)
at building fences but this park was (39:48 - 39:52)
already like the one in Berlin and (39:50 - 39:54)
already had a fence up they already they (39:52 - 39:57)
do tons of events there so you did have (39:54 - 40:01)
to wait and align the first day the line (39:57 - 40:04)
was maybe only 15 minutes the second day (40:01 - 40:07)
I didn't wait in line at all (40:04 - 40:08)
and then the third day I think I've only (40:07 - 40:10)
waited in line for like two minutes like (40:08 - 40:13)
it was going by really quickly that it (40:10 - 40:14)
started off like you were gonna be like (40:13 - 40:16)
I was in line forever it's no they again (40:14 - 40:19)
completely very efficient (40:16 - 40:21)
you had to show that you had the metal (40:19 - 40:23)
on your phone (40:21 - 40:28)
um to get in and that like that I think (40:23 - 40:29)
that was why the first day it took a (40:28 - 40:31)
little long because like that wasn't (40:29 - 40:33)
communicated super well to staff and (40:31 - 40:35)
then all like people would be prepping (40:33 - 40:38)
you way ahead of time to like have the (40:35 - 40:40)
metal open show that on your phone we'll (40:38 - 40:42)
let you in didn't you just have a (40:40 - 40:44)
screenshot of the metal you could just (40:42 - 40:46)
say yeah yeah (40:44 - 40:46)
but once you go into the park there's no (40:46 - 40:51)
no spawns (40:49 - 40:54)
um if you write don't have it so the (40:51 - 40:57)
other cool thing at least compared to I (40:54 - 40:59)
don't know maybe other go Fest is they (40:57 - 41:01)
were letting people in way early so like (40:59 - 41:03)
the event started at nine but they (41:01 - 41:05)
started letting people in at eight and (41:03 - 41:06)
you could just walk around the park and (41:05 - 41:07)
enjoy it (41:06 - 41:10)
before it kicked in which is like nice (41:07 - 41:11)
you don't like oh good nine o'clock (41:10 - 41:16)
started and I'm in line that's sucks so (41:11 - 41:19)
the other thing they did is because the (41:16 - 41:21)
things rotate so I think it was around (41:19 - 41:26)
like 1 30 I think the cutoff was (41:21 - 41:28)
and then (41:26 - 41:32)
two o'clock or 2 30 is when the (41:28 - 41:34)
afternoon afternoon people shifted over (41:32 - 41:38)
so there was like a hour break (41:34 - 41:38)
um which I still think is like a really (41:38 - 41:42)
good thing that Niantic should continue (41:40 - 41:44)
doing is that hour break especially just (41:42 - 41:46)
to like flip everything (41:44 - 41:49)
um they would let those people in early (41:46 - 41:53)
but they had a different route to exit (41:49 - 41:55)
people oh (41:53 - 42:00)
you spawns would die at 1 30. and spawns (41:55 - 42:03)
would wouldn't exist for people before 2 (42:00 - 42:06)
30 but it never felt like there was this (42:03 - 42:08)
oh like way too many people it was just (42:06 - 42:09)
like this flow of people entering and (42:08 - 42:11)
people exiting and it was super (42:09 - 42:12)
efficient (42:11 - 42:15)
that's way better than I expected that (42:12 - 42:17)
sounds like Japan (42:15 - 42:17)
the bad the bad thing (42:20 - 42:23)
um (42:22 - 42:27)
the first day it got up to 105 degrees (42:23 - 42:31)
uh on Saturday got up to (42:27 - 42:35)
115 degrees and we had a very cool cool (42:31 - 42:41)
103 degrees for Sunday thanks a lot (42:35 - 42:43)
yeah and I had to really drop the ball (42:41 - 42:45)
on weather here (42:43 - 42:47)
how have how had how did they respond to (42:45 - 42:49)
it though (42:47 - 42:52)
I heard that there were (42:49 - 42:52)
things for people who weren't feeling (42:53 - 42:56)
great (42:55 - 42:58)
yeah so (42:56 - 43:01)
um the team Mystic (42:58 - 43:05)
Valor Instinct all had the sprinklers in (43:01 - 43:08)
the tents and they were oh the biggest (43:05 - 43:11)
tents I've seen at a go Fest they were (43:08 - 43:13)
all right next to each other they were (43:11 - 43:16)
like not exciting it was just tables (43:13 - 43:18)
benches and then those like Mist (43:16 - 43:20)
sprinkler like you weren't soaked when (43:18 - 43:22)
you went in it it was like the Mist (43:20 - 43:25)
um so that was running plenty of shade (43:22 - 43:27)
in the park obviously there was (43:25 - 43:28)
stretches of the park where you know (43:27 - 43:33)
there's not trees or buildings so (43:28 - 43:35)
there were (43:33 - 43:38)
Niantic did pay for I did confirm this (43:35 - 43:40)
they did pay for unlimited water bottles (43:38 - 43:43)
the entire three days they did not run (43:40 - 43:45)
out (43:43 - 43:48)
um so at Safari Zone Vegas they had two (43:45 - 43:50)
water stations where you could refill (43:48 - 43:52)
your own water bottle and one of them (43:50 - 43:55)
broke like the first day so there was it (43:52 - 43:58)
went from two to one (43:55 - 44:00)
um you know the Chicago ones I went to (43:58 - 44:02)
they had water refill stations they (44:00 - 44:04)
would be you know out of water like (44:02 - 44:05)
halfway through the day (44:04 - 44:07)
they were giving out they weren't like (44:05 - 44:09)
the huge size water bottles they were (44:07 - 44:11)
like the hat like eight ounces or 10 (44:09 - 44:12)
ounces or something (44:11 - 44:15)
you could take as many as you want (44:12 - 44:18)
you could go back get another one all (44:15 - 44:20)
weekend unlimited water from water (44:18 - 44:22)
bottles I was like if this was Corporate (44:20 - 44:24)
America you know if we would be charging (44:22 - 44:26)
eight dollars an ounce (44:24 - 44:29)
um but Niantic did have the they said (44:26 - 44:32)
they paid for water they also had um tea (44:29 - 44:34)
that was a sponsor I guess for (44:32 - 44:37)
specifically that event uh and when we (44:34 - 44:39)
were leaving they were like here are (44:37 - 44:42)
eight more bottles of tea please take (44:39 - 44:45)
our green tea (44:42 - 44:48)
you get five when you come in you get (44:45 - 44:50)
another eight when you leave please (44:48 - 44:54)
drink our tea uh it was fine it was very (44:50 - 44:59)
bitter but do you like tea generally (44:54 - 44:59)
I (45:00 - 45:02)
it's yeah it's fine (45:01 - 45:04)
okay General I think tea is better (45:02 - 45:06)
that's where I was going with that (45:04 - 45:08)
from other people I was with they said (45:06 - 45:10)
it was more bitter than they're used to (45:08 - 45:13)
okay okay I gosh I wish I had it I was (45:10 - 45:15)
like you're not drinking it now this is (45:13 - 45:16)
like right in the middle of the camera (45:15 - 45:19)
like eight bottles (45:16 - 45:19)
they also had um there's like a museum (45:21 - 45:26)
in the park (45:24 - 45:29)
um and they had no problem with people (45:26 - 45:31)
going in and sitting in the air (45:29 - 45:34)
conditioning there was (45:31 - 45:38)
um I I wish we had like Al or somebody (45:34 - 45:39)
else on the show to talk about the (45:38 - 45:41)
London experience I've heard it's been (45:39 - 45:44)
rainy the whole time yeah it was rainy (45:41 - 45:47)
and I saw they had like a line of porta (45:44 - 45:49)
potties you know the blue standard porta (45:47 - 45:52)
potties we got the good bathrooms no (45:49 - 45:56)
porta potties we holy cow (45:52 - 45:59)
the bathrooms at this park yeah I felt (45:56 - 46:01)
like I could eat in the bathroom they (45:59 - 46:04)
were so clean yeah bathrooms in in (46:01 - 46:06)
Japanese public spaces (46:04 - 46:09)
we got good bathrooms there was a little (46:06 - 46:12)
there were restaurants (46:09 - 46:15)
um and they were all air conditioning as (46:12 - 46:17)
well they had no problem with you like (46:15 - 46:19)
just popping in for 10 minutes not (46:17 - 46:21)
buying anything just cooling off the (46:19 - 46:24)
medical tent had this like salt candy (46:21 - 46:26)
which is supposed to like add (46:24 - 46:28)
electrolytes back into you and they were (46:26 - 46:32)
giving that out for free they did have (46:28 - 46:34)
a couple vendors like one was like (46:32 - 46:36)
selling battery packs in the Pokemon go (46:34 - 46:38)
plus plus I think it was like SoftBank (46:36 - 46:40)
one of the cell phone providers (46:38 - 46:41)
um (46:40 - 46:45)
they had plenty of vending machines this (46:41 - 46:48)
is like a thing that like all parks all (46:45 - 46:50)
countries should have they should just (46:48 - 46:52)
have a million vending machines where (46:50 - 46:55)
you can get like a Coke for 150 Yen and (46:52 - 46:56)
not wait like (46:55 - 46:59)
when we're talking about like (46:56 - 47:02)
events of like okay like even when I (46:59 - 47:04)
went to (47:02 - 47:08)
Safari Zone Berlin or sorry go Fest in (47:04 - 47:12)
Berlin they had like a food truck aisle (47:08 - 47:15)
and your option was water or beer (47:12 - 47:18)
because you're in Germany and like (47:15 - 47:20)
people are like slamming Heineken at (47:18 - 47:21)
like 8 A.M (47:20 - 47:24)
like (47:21 - 47:26)
it didn't like they didn't have food (47:24 - 47:28)
trucks but they had the restaurants they (47:26 - 47:29)
had plenty of drinks Niantic was (47:28 - 47:32)
providing water the entire time (47:29 - 47:36)
for like being dehydrated you would have (47:32 - 47:37)
had to like (47:36 - 47:41)
tunnel vision into forgetting that you (47:37 - 47:42)
should be drinking (47:41 - 47:45)
um now obviously I'm sure there were (47:42 - 47:46)
people that had (47:45 - 47:50)
that were severely dihydrated but like (47:46 - 47:52)
you can only do something was doing as (47:50 - 47:54)
much as they could not have that happen (47:52 - 47:57)
yeah it sounds like this was pretty well (47:54 - 48:01)
run in that aspect yeah no like it was (47:57 - 48:02)
hot (48:01 - 48:06)
um I was also told by Niantic take this (48:02 - 48:09)
with a grain of salt that a lot of the (48:06 - 48:11)
people that ended up in the emergency (48:09 - 48:14)
slash medical area were not Japanese (48:11 - 48:17)
people they were (48:14 - 48:19)
foreigners (48:17 - 48:22)
I haven't told you that yeah they were (48:19 - 48:23)
like (48:22 - 48:25)
because the the people that were (48:23 - 48:26)
complaining (48:25 - 48:28)
were well I don't know maybe the (48:26 - 48:29)
Japanese people were complaining I just (48:28 - 48:32)
can't understand Japanese but the people (48:29 - 48:34)
that were complaining were (48:32 - 48:37)
English they spoke English and that (48:34 - 48:39)
right they look Americans are pretty (48:37 - 48:41)
loud myself included (48:39 - 48:43)
just the nature (48:41 - 48:44)
um but (48:43 - 48:49)
it was like weird that (48:44 - 48:51)
at first it was weird because you were (48:49 - 48:53)
like wow all these Japanese people are (48:51 - 48:54)
in like pants (48:53 - 48:58)
and they all have like long sleeves on (48:54 - 49:00)
and (48:58 - 49:02)
they have towels and they have hats and (49:00 - 49:04)
they have umbrellas and they have fans (49:02 - 49:08)
and they were killing it they they had (49:04 - 49:11)
no problem in the heat there's (49:08 - 49:13)
yeah always Pokemon events in August (49:11 - 49:15)
like the Pikachu outbreak thing is (49:13 - 49:18)
always like the first week of August and (49:15 - 49:20)
stuff but (49:18 - 49:22)
they also had like these cool like ice (49:20 - 49:24)
packs you can buy that are like hot (49:22 - 49:26)
hands but they're ice and you like crack (49:24 - 49:29)
them and they were instant nice but (49:26 - 49:31)
anyways like (49:29 - 49:33)
super super hot (49:31 - 49:37)
but like it didn't seem to phase like I (49:33 - 49:40)
would I would say like tourists or like (49:37 - 49:41)
um (49:40 - 49:43)
I would say it was like ten to one for (49:41 - 49:45)
like every 10 Japanese people there was (49:43 - 49:47)
probably like one Foreigner whether that (49:45 - 49:49)
was like Singapore or Taiwan or America (49:47 - 49:52)
or Mexico like it was very Japan (49:49 - 49:55)
dominated no surprise (49:52 - 49:56)
um (49:55 - 49:59)
but the amount of umbrellas the amount (49:56 - 50:01)
of like fans around your neck the amount (49:59 - 50:04)
of like long sleeves they they had (50:01 - 50:07)
umbrella or they had they had vests with (50:04 - 50:10)
fans built in (50:07 - 50:10)
blanket statement like just like Japan (50:13 - 50:19)
does everything better when it comes to (50:15 - 50:20)
these when it comes to this type of like (50:19 - 50:24)
you're like talking about like uh heat (50:20 - 50:26)
technology of sorts whether it's like (50:24 - 50:28)
you know high tech or low Tech but like (50:26 - 50:31)
it's just it it is typically done better (50:28 - 50:34)
like better I'll say better than America (50:31 - 50:36)
yeah at least I'm not going to call up (50:34 - 50:39)
like the whole world but I will say like (50:36 - 50:41)
this everything you're saying just (50:39 - 50:42)
speaks to (50:41 - 50:45)
if you if you're in Japan right like (50:42 - 50:46)
I've never been to an event in Japan but (50:45 - 50:48)
I've been to Tokyo twice and like the (50:46 - 50:50)
things you're saying are things that (50:48 - 50:54)
exist in just the cities in Japan as (50:50 - 50:55)
well right vending machines everywhere (50:54 - 50:58)
all these things like that is I've never (50:55 - 51:00)
drank more coke than when in Tokyo (50:58 - 51:02)
because there's a vending machine every (51:00 - 51:05)
10 steps with Coke available if you're (51:02 - 51:07)
ever in Japan during the cold season the (51:05 - 51:09)
corn soup is amazing from the vending (51:07 - 51:12)
machines that's my favorite see uh it's (51:09 - 51:14)
just like this this is a thing about (51:12 - 51:15)
Japan that's (51:14 - 51:17)
um (51:15 - 51:19)
just that is just very good so the (51:17 - 51:20)
things you're saying about the park are (51:19 - 51:22)
just like yes this just sounds like it (51:20 - 51:24)
would be done (51:22 - 51:26)
um (51:24 - 51:28)
better in in certain ways than you know (51:26 - 51:31)
events that maybe are happening in (51:28 - 51:34)
Chicago or other places just because the (51:31 - 51:37)
way that they do everything in Japan for (51:34 - 51:39)
those things is typically seems better (51:37 - 51:41)
than the way that we do things not (51:39 - 51:42)
everything but (51:41 - 51:44)
um the way that we do things you know in (51:42 - 51:46)
America it sounds like there was the (51:44 - 51:47)
structure for them to handle it very (51:46 - 51:49)
well there yeah I'm gonna say I still (51:47 - 51:51)
really hope it doesn't get up that hot (51:49 - 51:54)
in New York for go Fest because I don't (51:51 - 51:55)
have the confidence it would be handled (51:54 - 51:57)
as well we won't have the same (51:55 - 51:59)
experience though exactly I'm gonna (51:57 - 52:02)
prepare for either extreme heat or rain (51:59 - 52:04)
since that's the experience that this (52:02 - 52:06)
weekend has been for the two go fests (52:04 - 52:09)
and uh so far the weather looks moderate (52:06 - 52:12)
and fine but I want to be prepared (52:09 - 52:13)
either way (52:12 - 52:15)
I will say (52:13 - 52:16)
um (52:15 - 52:19)
okay two things before I forget like the (52:16 - 52:21)
fan situation of like Japanese people (52:19 - 52:23)
having fans around their neck or just (52:21 - 52:25)
portable fans they're holding or (52:23 - 52:27)
umbrellas was it's very obvious outside (52:25 - 52:29)
of go Fest like that's not a specific go (52:27 - 52:32)
thing like fans were everywhere on (52:29 - 52:35)
subways or just walking down the street (52:32 - 52:37)
um okay the second thing is again I (52:35 - 52:40)
wasn't in London but from pictures their (52:37 - 52:43)
exhibits or their habitats I think (52:40 - 52:45)
they're called (52:43 - 52:46)
um (52:45 - 52:50)
were way cooler than Japan's uh which is (52:46 - 52:52)
a little shocking they also had like (52:50 - 52:56)
this huge Terra Crystal thing that you (52:52 - 52:58)
could walk in and get pictures uh we (52:56 - 53:00)
didn't have that I don't know how big (52:58 - 53:03)
their park was (53:00 - 53:03)
um (53:03 - 53:08)
but I did really like the (53:03 - 53:11)
how the park was laid up like the the (53:08 - 53:13)
jungle area of the park I think was (53:11 - 53:17)
called the dark jungle was near like the (53:13 - 53:20)
most foresty slash tree part of it there (53:17 - 53:22)
was like this little river running (53:20 - 53:25)
through that followed the path there (53:22 - 53:27)
were like structures and stuff that felt (53:25 - 53:30)
very foresty the ferry area was just (53:27 - 53:32)
kind of in the middle of a field like it (53:30 - 53:35)
didn't feel that cool the Ice Area was (53:32 - 53:38)
like near the big body of water and then (53:35 - 53:40)
the volcano area was (53:38 - 53:42)
kind of near the entrance where all the (53:40 - 53:44)
raids were so I'd be curious (53:42 - 53:48)
how the structure of London I think was (53:44 - 53:50)
London or the yeah the London one felt (53:48 - 53:52)
but this park was laid out really well (53:50 - 53:55)
it was not as big (53:52 - 53:59)
as the Berlin go fest last year that (53:55 - 54:01)
Park was massive it had like 17 (53:59 - 54:04)
entrances it it was a gated Park like (54:01 - 54:06)
when a raid popped in that Park you're (54:04 - 54:07)
like I'm never going to get to it (54:06 - 54:09)
because it's a literally like a 40 (54:07 - 54:10)
minute walk to the other side of the (54:09 - 54:11)
park (54:10 - 54:12)
um (54:11 - 54:14)
but like (54:12 - 54:16)
if you were far away from the entrance (54:14 - 54:18)
there was still (54:16 - 54:21)
vending machines food (54:18 - 54:24)
um nice bathrooms like some form of (54:21 - 54:26)
shade like the the park itself was (54:24 - 54:30)
really good so if you're gonna compare (54:26 - 54:33)
real quick if you take last year uh in (54:30 - 54:35)
Germany giant Park like you said you (54:33 - 54:36)
want to get to a raid but you're not (54:35 - 54:38)
going to make it because it's the park (54:36 - 54:40)
is so big right that you got to travel (54:38 - 54:44)
versus Japan this year smaller park it (54:40 - 54:46)
sounds like there was a lot of stuff (54:44 - 54:47)
that was still like there was a lot of (54:46 - 54:50)
stuff everywhere though which would you (54:47 - 54:52)
think is (54:50 - 54:54)
I guess my question is what's better big (54:52 - 54:57)
giant park or smaller park for an event (54:54 - 54:59)
like this (54:57 - 55:01)
oh you broke up for a second so I missed (54:59 - 55:04)
your question outside uh (55:01 - 55:07)
uh what's better bigger park or smaller (55:04 - 55:08)
park for an event like this like from (55:07 - 55:10)
from your experience of last year versus (55:08 - 55:12)
this year (55:10 - 55:14)
um (55:12 - 55:17)
I think this park was the right size (55:14 - 55:20)
um I thought the the park for Seattle go (55:17 - 55:23)
Fest was too small (55:20 - 55:26)
and they they kind of like canceled that (55:23 - 55:27)
was like the first time they really did (55:26 - 55:30)
the city experience because obviously go (55:27 - 55:32)
Fest in Berlin was just like here's (55:30 - 55:35)
eight hours in this park you only get (55:32 - 55:36)
one day (55:35 - 55:38)
um and then Seattle was like four hours (55:36 - 55:40)
in the morning here here's the break (55:38 - 55:42)
four hours in the city (55:40 - 55:44)
um I thought the Seattle Park was like (55:42 - 55:46)
too small (55:44 - 55:51)
and I think this was the right size the (55:46 - 55:53)
the Safari Zone which obviously is going (55:51 - 55:56)
to go fast in Korea and goyang was a (55:53 - 55:58)
good size but like (55:56 - 56:01)
there was this huge (55:58 - 56:05)
Pond lake or whatever and if you started (56:01 - 56:07)
walking halfway you were kind of like (56:05 - 56:09)
committed and you're like well if I turn (56:07 - 56:10)
around it's gonna be the like I have to (56:09 - 56:12)
just finish it and there was like kind (56:10 - 56:14)
of nothing over there (56:12 - 56:17)
um where this park and like other go (56:14 - 56:18)
Fest (56:17 - 56:21)
it felt like there was always something (56:18 - 56:22)
um (56:21 - 56:24)
and I (56:22 - 56:26)
I don't remember a lot of I don't (56:24 - 56:28)
remember a lot of things going wrong for (56:26 - 56:30)
Seattle I was actually really impressed (56:28 - 56:32)
with the Seattle go Fest and (56:30 - 56:33)
um (56:32 - 56:36)
connection wise here super stable they (56:33 - 56:38)
had cows cows or cellular on Wheels they (56:36 - 56:41)
had way more cows than I've ever seen at (56:38 - 56:42)
a park (56:41 - 56:45)
um and so that was super super stable (56:42 - 56:49)
they had like domoko and Au and SoftBank (56:45 - 56:53)
well whatever six cell phone service (56:49 - 56:55)
they had plenty of cows there was only (56:53 - 56:58)
one dead spot the first day (56:55 - 57:01)
um which was the team Lounge area uh my (56:58 - 57:02)
backpack completely dropped out and I (57:01 - 57:04)
was talking to Niantic about it and they (57:02 - 57:05)
were like yeah we can't figure it out (57:04 - 57:07)
and then Saturday and Sunday it worked (57:05 - 57:11)
fine so if it was literally just like (57:07 - 57:13)
like the Mystic tent didn't work but if (57:11 - 57:15)
you're in Valor and you were in Mystic (57:13 - 57:18)
features like two feet away those tents (57:15 - 57:20)
worked there was just this weird dead (57:18 - 57:21)
spot in Mystic (57:20 - 57:23)
and I avoided it and then Saturday (57:21 - 57:26)
Sunday they fixed it I don't know why (57:23 - 57:28)
there was a dead spot I don't wear it (57:26 - 57:29)
not a cell phone person (57:28 - 57:34)
[Laughter] (57:29 - 57:34)
yeah oh overall (57:34 - 57:38)
like I I will say like going back to (57:39 - 57:44)
heat stuff (57:42 - 57:47)
I have never played Pokemon I've I've (57:44 - 57:50)
like streamed every Pokemon go Fest (57:47 - 57:53)
since I got my stream backpack (57:50 - 57:55)
um it's definitely changed over the last (57:53 - 57:57)
couple years but like (57:55 - 58:00)
I'm used to being super hot like I'm (57:57 - 58:02)
used to wearing jeans and still being (58:00 - 58:05)
like I'm fine in the summer (58:02 - 58:07)
um you the backpack gets like (58:05 - 58:09)
and unbelievably hot because you have (58:07 - 58:11)
two big batteries you have a little (58:09 - 58:13)
computer like pumping out heat because (58:11 - 58:15)
it's trying to cool itself (58:13 - 58:17)
um like I'm so used to just being really (58:15 - 58:19)
sweaty when I stream Pokemon go in the (58:17 - 58:21)
summer because it's already hot what if (58:19 - 58:22)
I didn't have the backpack I'd still be (58:21 - 58:23)
sweating but the backpack just makes me (58:22 - 58:28)
sweat I have never streamed in this sort (58:23 - 58:32)
of heat where just I'm watching sweat (58:28 - 58:34)
pour out of my watch band and like I'm (58:32 - 58:36)
checking my legs because I (58:34 - 58:38)
think there's like a bug on me or (58:36 - 58:42)
there's like a and it's just it's just (58:38 - 58:45)
visible sweat just pouring off of you it (58:42 - 58:47)
was just that hot and that sounds (58:45 - 58:49)
miserable (58:47 - 58:51)
um a jean and hoodie or jeans no no no (58:49 - 58:54)
no I I okay (58:51 - 58:58)
Michael Steve I brought moisture wicking (58:54 - 59:01)
I brought the bird dogs I don't know if (58:58 - 59:02)
there's a bird dog ad in this episode or (59:01 - 59:04)
not but we've run ads for them before (59:02 - 59:05)
they sent me like free stuff I brought (59:04 - 59:08)
the bird dog sweatpant moisture wicking (59:05 - 59:09)
sweatpants (59:08 - 59:13)
and my legs were not the problem and (59:09 - 59:15)
then the the second day I wore the bird (59:13 - 59:17)
dog shorts which (59:15 - 59:19)
I don't think they made me any it was (59:17 - 59:21)
just so hot that I think the Japanese (59:19 - 59:23)
people were right just wear the long (59:21 - 59:26)
sleeves to prevent the sunburn because (59:23 - 59:29)
you have other ways to cool off (59:26 - 59:30)
um (59:29 - 59:32)
so yeah like (59:30 - 59:35)
on the flip side the city experience so (59:32 - 59:37)
right outside of the 70s Expo Park was a (59:35 - 59:40)
pretty big mall uh and they had really (59:37 - 59:43)
good spawns and and you could just play (59:40 - 59:45)
there was air conditioning and then some (59:43 - 59:47)
people were just playing downtown Osaka (59:45 - 59:50)
which is really famous for (59:47 - 59:52)
being a huge place to play Pokemon go (59:50 - 59:54)
plus they have their Mall down there (59:52 - 59:56)
they have all the shops where they have (59:54 - 59:59)
like they're like outside hallways but (59:56 - 60:01)
they're covered (59:59 - 60:04)
um and obviously (60:01 - 60:06)
there's 9 million 7-Elevens you can pop (60:04 - 60:09)
into to like grab something and like (60:06 - 60:11)
cool off right so when I was playing (60:09 - 60:14)
with Stephen who in our slack (60:11 - 60:16)
um he was like I don't know how you did (60:14 - 60:19)
the park three days in a row because (60:16 - 60:23)
it's so hot and you're outside the (60:19 - 60:24)
entire time like yeah if I say it's (60:23 - 60:27)
cooler in the shade but like this he (60:24 - 60:28)
said the city experience was so much (60:27 - 60:30)
better because he could play in a mall (60:28 - 60:33)
or he could like jump back into his (60:30 - 60:35)
hotel room and then jump back outside (60:33 - 60:38)
and like had more control he was like (60:35 - 60:41)
the park is like cool to see once but (60:38 - 60:44)
the city experience was like (60:41 - 60:47)
flight more flexible (60:44 - 60:48)
um (60:47 - 60:54)
and I can't say I disagree you're right (60:48 - 60:57)
so did you do both like all all three (60:54 - 61:00)
days did you do like did you start in (60:57 - 61:02)
the park and then do City stuff (61:00 - 61:06)
all three days of go Fest or yeah (61:02 - 61:07)
um obviously I had like the special (61:06 - 61:09)
ticket so if you have a normal ticket (61:07 - 61:11)
it's parked for four hours four or five (61:09 - 61:13)
hours in the city the rest of the time (61:11 - 61:15)
but I went to the park every day in the (61:13 - 61:18)
morning which was the coolest part of (61:15 - 61:20)
the day (61:18 - 61:23)
um and then here's a pro tip (61:20 - 61:25)
these events are always going to be (61:23 - 61:27)
during summer right (61:25 - 61:31)
like summer is niantic's Christmas it's (61:27 - 61:33)
the easiest to (61:31 - 61:35)
you know they make the most money during (61:33 - 61:36)
the summer they have their big event (61:35 - 61:39)
during the summer sure they a lot of (61:36 - 61:40)
things happen this summer right A lot of (61:39 - 61:42)
people go on vacation (61:40 - 61:45)
most people can play at least right now (61:42 - 61:48)
right there's no school (61:45 - 61:50)
that kind of stuff it's always gonna be (61:48 - 61:51)
during the summer (61:50 - 61:54)
always pick the morning slot in the park (61:51 - 61:57)
because the mornings are always at least (61:54 - 61:59)
like 10 degrees cooler and then you can (61:57 - 62:01)
get lunch and then find a mall or (61:59 - 62:03)
something I don't know I everyone I've (62:01 - 62:05)
talked to was like I'm so glad I got (62:03 - 62:07)
morning because it just once like two (62:05 - 62:09)
o'clock hit that was like the hottest (62:07 - 62:11)
point of the day (62:09 - 62:13)
did you play any afternoon in the park (62:11 - 62:15)
or were you always done did you always (62:13 - 62:18)
just do the morning I always I always (62:15 - 62:20)
popped out it was yeah (62:18 - 62:24)
if there was one point where Niantic was (62:20 - 62:26)
like hey we want to do some pictures (62:24 - 62:28)
from a promotional material (62:26 - 62:29)
and I was like cool so I took my (62:28 - 62:31)
backpack off and I just set it up and (62:29 - 62:35)
pointed it and I was like man I I could (62:31 - 62:36)
do this all eight hours if I didn't have (62:35 - 62:39)
my backpack my back it's just so heavy (62:36 - 62:41)
and it's so hot so like today if you're (62:39 - 62:43)
watching like the video it looks like (62:41 - 62:45)
I'm exhausted and it's like it's just (62:43 - 62:48)
because of the heat it's yeah it's also (62:45 - 62:51)
just three days I walked (62:48 - 62:54)
10 miles every day so 30 miles in three (62:51 - 62:59)
days my feet feel like mashed potatoes (62:54 - 63:02)
like (62:59 - 63:02)
it's just a lot that's an intense event (63:03 - 63:10)
that is an intense event did the stream (63:07 - 63:11)
equipment all hold up well the whole (63:10 - 63:13)
time yeah yeah yeah yeah stuff is not (63:11 - 63:15)
just destroyed after three the only (63:13 - 63:17)
technical issue I had was like one of my (63:15 - 63:19)
cables eventually frayed I'm 90 kids (63:17 - 63:21)
will remember this where like your (63:19 - 63:22)
headphones aren't working and you like (63:21 - 63:24)
wrap it around like your iPod a certain (63:22 - 63:27)
way to like get the audio to like one of (63:24 - 63:29)
my HDMI cable did that I'm like wiggling (63:27 - 63:31)
it to get like connection and I was like (63:29 - 63:33)
I got a new one (63:31 - 63:36)
yeah okay so it was so hot that was (63:33 - 63:39)
actually cool for you to bring up it was (63:36 - 63:42)
so hot that (63:39 - 63:47)
like Pogo was just so slow it wasn't (63:42 - 63:48)
like (63:47 - 63:50)
the servers were bad or the internet was (63:48 - 63:55)
bad it was physically so hot that the (63:50 - 63:59)
phones couldn't yeah yeah like imagine (63:55 - 64:01)
like your gaming computer under your (63:59 - 64:03)
desk and just rip your two fans out and (64:01 - 64:05)
don't have any cooling your computer (64:03 - 64:07)
will dramatically slow down right yeah (64:05 - 64:10)
so again another thing shout out to the (64:07 - 64:12)
Japanese people they had the like cooler (64:10 - 64:15)
things like this fan that would attach (64:12 - 64:17)
to the back of the phone and it would (64:15 - 64:20)
like cool the phone in real time and (64:17 - 64:22)
like one of the old Japanese guys I was (64:20 - 64:24)
like talking to like he let me touch (64:22 - 64:26)
like fan it was like ice cold and he's (64:24 - 64:28)
like yeah this is on the back of my (64:26 - 64:30)
phone the entire time (64:28 - 64:34)
yeah seriously I don't okay here's don't (64:30 - 64:36)
buy the Razer one there's like a razor (64:34 - 64:39)
one that like mag safe for iPhones or (64:36 - 64:42)
Androids it's like 70 bucks it does not (64:39 - 64:45)
get as cold as the Japanese ones and (64:42 - 64:49)
like it kind of worked like (64:45 - 64:51)
when your iPhone gets really hot the (64:49 - 64:53)
screen will dim and then like it'll like (64:51 - 64:55)
disable the flashlight so you can't turn (64:53 - 64:56)
the flashlight on because that obviously (64:55 - 64:58)
makes your phone hot too it like (64:56 - 65:00)
prevented the screen from dimming (64:58 - 65:03)
but wow yeah I've talked to multiple (65:00 - 65:06)
people iPhone Android and it was like (65:03 - 65:10)
it's just so hot our phones are like not (65:06 - 65:13)
keeping up I got my phone's battery (65:10 - 65:15)
replaced recently hoping that it would (65:13 - 65:17)
fix some of that issue some of those (65:15 - 65:20)
issues because my battery overheats all (65:17 - 65:23)
the time and has those issues uh it (65:20 - 65:24)
didn't fix it I think it might be (65:23 - 65:26)
because I use magsafe charging all the (65:24 - 65:27)
time (65:26 - 65:30)
maxf would be hotter (65:27 - 65:33)
yeah but my phone just overheats all the (65:30 - 65:34)
time the battery and the phone overall (65:33 - 65:36)
is just cooked (65:34 - 65:40)
yeah I I feel like playing doing the AR (65:36 - 65:42)
stuff like AR pictures and things like (65:40 - 65:44)
that come across a lot of times on my (65:42 - 65:45)
phone (65:44 - 65:47)
like starts just getting quite hot and (65:45 - 65:49)
the screen dims and then you can't see (65:47 - 65:51)
anything or whatever you can just you (65:49 - 65:53)
know that's just like in normal weather (65:51 - 65:55)
right yeah I can't imagine playing in (65:53 - 65:58)
115 yes exactly (65:55 - 66:01)
I'm telling my kids in the future (65:58 - 66:04)
back in my day we played in 115 degree (66:01 - 66:07)
weather listen to the cicadas here's (66:04 - 66:10)
another thing that I didn't realize (66:07 - 66:10)
um (66:10 - 66:13)
I turned off native refresh (66:10 - 66:15)
which is supposed to like Smooth out (66:13 - 66:18)
your phone but because native refresh (66:15 - 66:20)
uses more processing (66:18 - 66:23)
turning it off actually made my phone (66:20 - 66:25)
run faster (66:23 - 66:27)
that makes sense in the heat that was (66:25 - 66:29)
the thing that like brought it down to (66:27 - 66:31)
30 frames per second that one yeah (66:29 - 66:33)
instead of 60. (66:31 - 66:38)
so wow shiny rate was good it was fine (66:33 - 66:40)
it felt exactly like (66:38 - 66:42)
Pasco Fest I know there's always this (66:40 - 66:44)
controversial thing where people are (66:42 - 66:47)
like Niantic Nerf did like it felt (66:44 - 66:49)
exactly the same here's gonna be the (66:47 - 66:51)
test right it's because we're talking (66:49 - 66:54)
about this at the the go tour right the (66:51 - 66:57)
Hoenn tour uh now that there are the (66:54 - 66:59)
in-person go fests I guess there was (66:57 - 67:01)
last year too but now that that's (66:59 - 67:03)
happening will the shiny rate be good on (67:01 - 67:05)
the global one right because that was (67:03 - 67:06)
the thing we were talking about back in (67:05 - 67:09)
February March where we were like the go (67:06 - 67:12)
tour the hohen tour the shiny area was (67:09 - 67:14)
not boosted for the authority officially (67:12 - 67:15)
announced that it's going to be (67:14 - 67:18)
different I don't remember the exact (67:15 - 67:19)
difference I would imagine with a 15 (67:18 - 67:21)
ticket versus (67:19 - 67:24)
um the Hoenn tour was free I think uh (67:21 - 67:26)
for the global one yeah yeah so with a (67:24 - 67:29)
15 ticket I assume the shiny rates are (67:26 - 67:31)
going to be boosted but I remember (67:29 - 67:32)
having this conversation in February (67:31 - 67:34)
being like okay when go Fest comes (67:32 - 67:36)
around are they gonna Nerf the shiny (67:34 - 67:38)
rates for Global because they want more (67:36 - 67:40)
people going to those in-person events (67:38 - 67:43)
now or are they going to keep them (67:40 - 67:45)
boosted and I assume with a 15 ticket (67:43 - 67:47)
they will because if they don't (67:45 - 67:49)
they're gonna it's gonna be (67:47 - 67:53)
a whole new Heroes Niantic at the end of (67:49 - 67:56)
August so yeah (67:53 - 67:58)
um yeah I mean like (67:56 - 67:59)
it's funny because I've been talking (67:58 - 68:01)
about go Fest for 30 minutes and we just (67:59 - 68:03)
brought up the shiny stuff which is I (68:01 - 68:06)
think why a lot of people go to go Fest (68:03 - 68:09)
like I ended up getting like 42 shinies (68:06 - 68:13)
and 15 of those shinies were in an hour (68:09 - 68:16)
uh and that was just when I took my (68:13 - 68:18)
backpack off (68:16 - 68:20)
I showered I went downtown and I was (68:18 - 68:23)
like I'm not talking to chat I don't (68:20 - 68:26)
have my backpack on I'm just doing this (68:23 - 68:29)
last hour by myself I put my Crocs on (68:26 - 68:31)
put them in sport mode and like I (68:29 - 68:34)
grinded it out like it's very easy to go (68:31 - 68:35)
to one of these events (68:34 - 68:38)
and like tunnel vision and just grind (68:35 - 68:40)
out Chinese if that's what you want to (68:38 - 68:41)
do (68:40 - 68:44)
I try to slow down especially because (68:41 - 68:46)
I'm like traveling and I like obviously (68:44 - 68:48)
I'm streaming it so I like to show (68:46 - 68:49)
people the park I like to show people (68:48 - 68:50)
what they're getting I like to talk to (68:49 - 68:52)
people (68:50 - 68:55)
um I've tried to take pictures because (68:52 - 68:56)
I've definitely gone to a go Fest I (68:55 - 68:59)
think it was Germany where I was like oh (68:56 - 69:01)
I didn't take a single picture of this (68:59 - 69:04)
park like that sucks I should have done (69:01 - 69:05)
that (69:04 - 69:07)
um you know I'm talking with people I'm (69:05 - 69:09)
jumping into raids which raids are still (69:07 - 69:12)
time consuming but you get the cool (69:09 - 69:14)
background like it was cool to get like (69:12 - 69:16)
a soccer Castle behind like Rayquaza (69:14 - 69:17)
that's just to me that's really cool (69:16 - 69:19)
some people don't care about that (69:17 - 69:20)
um (69:19 - 69:25)
and like trades like trades take a while (69:20 - 69:27)
I know there's like a joke in the (69:25 - 69:29)
Pokemon Community where like the (69:27 - 69:33)
Singaporean Grandma joke like Niantic at (69:29 - 69:35)
one point in an interview said like our (69:33 - 69:38)
average player base is a (69:35 - 69:40)
70 year old Singaporean grandma or (69:38 - 69:41)
whatever (69:40 - 69:43)
here's the thing (69:41 - 69:46)
here's a pro tip (69:43 - 69:48)
the old (69:46 - 69:50)
grandmas the old ladies whatever you (69:48 - 69:51)
want to say (69:50 - 69:53)
they are the (69:51 - 69:56)
um 100 percent best people to ever trade (69:53 - 70:00)
with they're so awesome let me tell you (69:56 - 70:03)
every single Grandma I traded with they (70:00 - 70:06)
were level 50. they had a laminate (70:03 - 70:10)
poster of what Pokemon they wanted (70:06 - 70:14)
what Pokemon they had to trade they all (70:10 - 70:16)
I'm not exaggerating I I did 14 trades (70:14 - 70:18)
with old ladies or old men they were all (70:16 - 70:20)
the same (70:18 - 70:22)
they had (70:20 - 70:25)
postcards from very specific stop one (70:22 - 70:28)
lady had 20 Pokemon Center postcards she (70:25 - 70:29)
was like different ones she was like (70:28 - 70:32)
which one do you want I was like (70:29 - 70:34)
I I just want the Pikachu but you're (70:32 - 70:37)
offering me like a cool ryco postcard (70:34 - 70:38)
that I don't know where it came from I (70:37 - 70:40)
guess I'm taking that she's like let me (70:38 - 70:41)
put one of my best stickers on it (70:40 - 70:43)
because we're about to trade they're (70:41 - 70:45)
they're all level 50. they they have (70:43 - 70:49)
like eight million Stardust they they (70:45 - 70:50)
were (70:49 - 70:54)
Pom-Pom oricorios going crazy buffelance (70:50 - 70:57)
going crazy I traded an old man a (70:54 - 71:00)
bufalant and he was so excited he gave (70:57 - 71:02)
me a hug Japanese people do not touch (71:00 - 71:04)
other people he just burst it out in a (71:02 - 71:06)
hug so (71:04 - 71:08)
I know of the like Singaporean Grandma (71:06 - 71:11)
thing is like a joke but I I think there (71:08 - 71:13)
was some truth to it to Niantic like (71:11 - 71:16)
these they're never trade with a child (71:13 - 71:20)
never like children they have nothing (71:16 - 71:22)
they have like four shinies and they (71:20 - 71:25)
want like a Shiny Rayquaza but you can (71:22 - 71:27)
give them such a good memory right no I (71:25 - 71:29)
think honestly I think it's it's the (71:27 - 71:31)
older people or the very young people (71:29 - 71:34)
who will be excite they don't need it to (71:31 - 71:38)
be like the 100 IV China Pikachu that (71:34 - 71:40)
you only get at this event that they're (71:38 - 71:41)
never gonna do anything with but now (71:40 - 71:44)
they have it like you're it's like (71:41 - 71:47)
little kids you can give them something (71:44 - 71:49)
and they'll be like super excited about (71:47 - 71:51)
that Lugia or Ho-Oh or something even (71:49 - 71:54)
though it's been back 400 times right or (71:51 - 71:56)
like older people same thing right you (71:54 - 71:58)
give them that Buffalo or that Pom-Pom (71:56 - 72:01)
or choreo and uh it's that middle it's (71:58 - 72:05)
that us people who it's like oh this (72:01 - 72:07)
isn't the shiny Buffalo it's like that's (72:05 - 72:08)
not even in the game right so but like (72:07 - 72:13)
you know uh you know so I think yeah no (72:08 - 72:14)
regeneration older generation we're good (72:13 - 72:18)
for me like the trading is one of the (72:14 - 72:21)
coolest parts of go Fest (72:18 - 72:24)
and (72:21 - 72:24)
I like there were some trades I didn't (72:24 - 72:29)
need like somebody was like (72:27 - 72:33)
I really want a bufalant and they had (72:29 - 72:35)
like a shiny Uxie and I was like I they (72:33 - 72:37)
were like you want Chinese I was like I (72:35 - 72:39)
don't like I yeah I need it but also (72:37 - 72:42)
like I don't care that much about shiny (72:39 - 72:45)
Uxie like whatever it's like it's in (72:42 - 72:46)
like a million games right like I can (72:45 - 72:48)
shiny onto the sword shield but like (72:46 - 72:51)
they wanted the bufalance so bad and I (72:48 - 72:54)
was like and I traded to them and they (72:51 - 72:57)
were so happy and you know I got a lot (72:54 - 72:59)
of things I was missing like I got a lot (72:57 - 73:01)
of shiny Pikachus with balloons I was (72:59 - 73:03)
missing I got like the Okinawa Pikachu I (73:01 - 73:05)
got the Singapore Pika like I got a lot (73:03 - 73:08)
of stuff I was missing for oracoreos and (73:05 - 73:10)
four boothalants and I think like what (73:08 - 73:12)
Bobby was saying like the maybe like the (73:10 - 73:15)
26 year old hardcore I want 100 IV (73:12 - 73:18)
Rayquaza they're probably thinking like (73:15 - 73:21)
Buffalo will eventually be at a future (73:18 - 73:25)
event which is true but like (73:21 - 73:27)
I don't know like all the old ladies I'd (73:25 - 73:29)
traded with they had like 40 shiny hair (73:27 - 73:31)
across and they just want buffalo like (73:29 - 73:34)
I'm not gonna like be like Hey listen (73:31 - 73:36)
wait another like they want the Buffalo (73:34 - 73:38)
land like just and they were all super (73:36 - 73:40)
happy about it yeah it's all about (73:38 - 73:43)
giving and not receiving right (73:40 - 73:45)
that's why I have 500 Pokemon in my (73:43 - 73:47)
trade folder I love making people happy (73:45 - 73:48)
with trades there aren't going to be (73:47 - 73:50)
enough special trades available for me (73:48 - 73:52)
to trade in New York (73:50 - 73:54)
exactly exactly yeah I don't know what (73:52 - 73:57)
would I will say like the ones that (73:54 - 73:59)
people were asking for a lot in Japan (73:57 - 74:03)
were oricorio buffalant maractus and (73:59 - 74:05)
Hawlucha it didn't seem like people (74:03 - 74:08)
cared about campe or klefki probably (74:05 - 74:09)
because like (74:08 - 74:12)
they're just harder (74:09 - 74:15)
um like klefki should be as easy as (74:12 - 74:18)
buffalant (74:15 - 74:20)
but I don't know maybe Japanese people (74:18 - 74:23)
expected more Americans than (74:20 - 74:26)
people in Paris I have heard with routes (74:23 - 74:27)
and I think Bobby you're one of the (74:26 - 74:28)
people who's been pointing this out (74:27 - 74:32)
routes are great for finding regionals (74:28 - 74:37)
yes I yeah I went on a couple routes and (74:32 - 74:40)
well I only got one Regional in that but (74:37 - 74:41)
it was just a really short they were (74:40 - 74:42)
really short routes I just did one and (74:41 - 74:45)
reversed it but I got like a throw right (74:42 - 74:46)
like there was a throw on the route um (74:45 - 74:48)
but other people have been saying yeah (74:46 - 74:52)
there have been uh some local regionals (74:48 - 74:55)
on those routes so if you travel to a (74:52 - 74:57)
place and are looking for a regional but (74:55 - 74:59)
are having a hard time finding it (74:57 - 75:00)
it might be a little bit easier to get (74:59 - 75:03)
them once routes start consistently (75:00 - 75:04)
working (75:03 - 75:07)
yeah it seemed like with the people I (75:04 - 75:09)
traded with like flabebe was like not (75:07 - 75:11)
that popular I think people forget that (75:09 - 75:15)
there's like five dollars yeah (75:11 - 75:15)
um (75:15 - 75:20)
furfur was like 50 50. (75:15 - 75:21)
um obviously the Kabuki furfur is like (75:20 - 75:24)
impossible for most people (75:21 - 75:26)
um but it was like people were super (75:24 - 75:29)
into oricorio and super into Buffalo and (75:26 - 75:31)
then the last one was probably like top (75:29 - 75:33)
three was like oricoria bufland halucha (75:31 - 75:36)
so I would assume that hello show would (75:33 - 75:38)
probably be the most popular one in (75:36 - 75:41)
Mexico in in New York (75:38 - 75:45)
yeah I I have so halucha because of the (75:41 - 75:48)
way that it spawns it spawns in San (75:45 - 75:50)
Diego as well so like if I drive like I (75:48 - 75:52)
have a few halucha in my storage because (75:50 - 75:55)
if I just drive about 15 minutes south (75:52 - 75:57)
um there are Hawlucha popping up around (75:55 - 75:59)
San Diego (75:57 - 76:02)
um just because it's like the I think (75:59 - 76:04)
it's because the most most northern part (76:02 - 76:08)
of Mexico if you go plus is at the same (76:04 - 76:10)
as where San Diego is just to some (76:08 - 76:12)
extent (76:10 - 76:14)
um and so I did I went and caught some (76:12 - 76:17)
Hawlucha because I went to um like a (76:14 - 76:19)
trading card event thing up in a few (76:17 - 76:22)
hours North from here and it was (76:19 - 76:24)
surprising I was like hey I have halucha (76:22 - 76:26)
if any but like I wasn't trying to trade (76:24 - 76:28)
like it wasn't a go specific thing but (76:26 - 76:29)
it was a Pokemon thing so there's people (76:28 - 76:31)
playing go and I was just telling people (76:29 - 76:33)
like oh if you want like a half Hawlucha (76:31 - 76:34)
and it was surprising for the people (76:33 - 76:38)
that were like uh like no I'm good and I (76:34 - 76:39)
was just like I'm at the wrong event (76:38 - 76:42)
like if I was at like any go event right (76:39 - 76:43)
now I feel like people would just be (76:42 - 76:46)
like yes absolutely yeah and then people (76:43 - 76:47)
here were just like they were playing go (76:46 - 76:49)
but they were like (76:47 - 76:52)
no I'm good and they were coming from (76:49 - 76:54)
other parts of the country too so it (76:52 - 76:55)
wasn't like people that were just like (76:54 - 76:58)
oh I'll just go get one I was like all (76:55 - 77:01)
right clearly I need to go to Casual (76:58 - 77:04)
events players yeah yeah not the (77:01 - 77:06)
Singaporean grandmas (77:04 - 77:09)
level 50. exactly exactly they didn't (77:06 - 77:13)
have 14 shiny hair across (77:09 - 77:13)
no oh like (77:14 - 77:17)
Niantic can't control the weather (77:15 - 77:19)
obviously August is always going to be (77:17 - 77:21)
hot it would like (77:19 - 77:21)
um (77:21 - 77:23)
it would have been nice if it was like (77:21 - 77:25)
July (77:23 - 77:28)
um or earlier (77:25 - 77:30)
but (77:28 - 77:34)
these events are what book six eight ten (77:30 - 77:36)
months in advance right like you won if (77:34 - 77:39)
you want a venue at least like 70s Expo (77:36 - 77:40)
Park (77:39 - 77:43)
like they had another event inside (77:40 - 77:46)
Pokemon go Fest that was getting set up (77:43 - 77:49)
like they're running events non-stop so (77:46 - 77:50)
it's (77:49 - 77:52)
you know when I asked Niantic like why (77:50 - 77:53)
is London and (77:52 - 77:56)
Osaka the same weekend and they were (77:53 - 77:57)
like (77:56 - 77:59)
those were the only dates like right (77:57 - 78:03)
like we can't it's probably busy next (77:59 - 78:04)
week it's probably a year out that they (78:03 - 78:06)
had to that they had to plan these (78:04 - 78:09)
things like yeah so it's like giant (78:06 - 78:11)
parks and things like that like somebody (78:09 - 78:12)
cities (78:11 - 78:14)
some of my twitch chat was like it's too (78:12 - 78:17)
hot they should reschedule it (78:14 - 78:21)
when next year like just next weekend (78:17 - 78:23)
it's good I'm sure it'll be open no (78:21 - 78:25)
probably I'm sure this giant Convention (78:23 - 78:27)
Center doesn't have anything happening (78:25 - 78:29)
next weekend (78:27 - 78:32)
then well you know we'll all get back on (78:29 - 78:34)
the flight from you know Australia and (78:32 - 78:36)
the United States and Germany and we'll (78:34 - 78:37)
come back next week in the play like (78:36 - 78:39)
easy easy yeah I don't like I don't see (78:37 - 78:41)
a problem there (78:39 - 78:43)
yeah just just reschedule no big deal (78:41 - 78:47)
it's very easy to do (78:43 - 78:50)
um yeah I mean like again Niantic paid (78:47 - 78:51)
for my ticket (78:50 - 78:54)
I said this when they weren't paying for (78:51 - 78:56)
my ticket I think they do live events (78:54 - 78:59)
pretty well it's complicated I mean like (78:56 - 79:02)
the the Vegas thing was unfortunate (78:59 - 79:03)
because (79:02 - 79:06)
they had internet for x amount of people (79:03 - 79:08)
and double the amount of people showed (79:06 - 79:10)
up because they were just like I'm gonna (79:08 - 79:12)
show up without a ticket was that the (79:10 - 79:14)
one where they were tweeted to people (79:12 - 79:16)
like don't show up if you don't have a (79:14 - 79:19)
ticket go away they had the very passive (79:16 - 79:23)
aggressive please don't come to us no (79:19 - 79:23)
make that tweet I like passive (79:23 - 79:29)
aggressive Niantic honestly (79:25 - 79:29)
I thought it was pretty good (79:29 - 79:35)
like look there's no spawns why are you (79:32 - 79:36)
showing up (79:35 - 79:38)
I mean later in the Tweet thread they (79:36 - 79:39)
were a little bit more clear and (79:38 - 79:42)
straightforward and I appreciated that (79:39 - 79:45)
yeah (79:42 - 79:46)
um (79:45 - 79:48)
other side note I had dinner with (79:46 - 79:49)
Niantic (79:48 - 79:50)
um (79:49 - 79:54)
the team is much smaller than what it (79:50 - 79:57)
used to be they had layoffs so people (79:54 - 80:00)
I'm used to seeing at these go fests (79:57 - 80:02)
don't work for the company anymore uh (80:00 - 80:05)
the people I did meet (80:02 - 80:07)
they're still super passionate about the (80:05 - 80:09)
game they're still super excited they (80:07 - 80:11)
were still very happy with how the event (80:09 - 80:15)
went and you know heat aside I think you (80:11 - 80:16)
know we talk about the only problem that (80:15 - 80:19)
the event was the Heat (80:16 - 80:19)
it's like refreshing because I can tell (80:20 - 80:24)
those people care about the game (80:22 - 80:26)
I don't have any inside information but (80:24 - 80:28)
as somebody who has worked a nine to (80:26 - 80:30)
five job and probably other people (80:28 - 80:32)
listening to the nine to five job (80:30 - 80:33)
you know you might have a really cool (80:32 - 80:36)
boss that's really passionate and maybe (80:33 - 80:38)
your boss's boss (80:36 - 80:41)
kind of sucks or your boss's boss kind (80:38 - 80:45)
of also sucks and it feels this is just (80:41 - 80:48)
my opinion it feels like that's Niantic (80:45 - 80:51)
and a lot of companies honestly where (80:48 - 80:54)
you have very passionate people the (80:51 - 80:55)
people above you are maybe less (80:54 - 80:58)
passionate the people above them are not (80:55 - 80:59)
passionate at all well they're (80:58 - 81:02)
passionate about money (80:59 - 81:02)
here's the thing right (81:02 - 81:06)
um when you work in a company a big (81:04 - 81:08)
small whatever (81:06 - 81:10)
if you started the company you're (81:08 - 81:12)
probably passionate right because you (81:10 - 81:15)
started the company like about whatever (81:12 - 81:17)
it is like you probably have some kind (81:15 - 81:20)
of passion unless you are like a hedge (81:17 - 81:21)
fund Banker who decided to start a (81:20 - 81:22)
different company because you were going (81:21 - 81:24)
to make tons of money most people who (81:22 - 81:26)
are the founder of a company have some (81:24 - 81:27)
passion toward the thing that they have (81:26 - 81:30)
founded because it is their life they (81:27 - 81:32)
have to like this funds them and this is (81:30 - 81:34)
what they're doing they have some kind (81:32 - 81:35)
of passion toward that (81:34 - 81:38)
we start hiring people who didn't start (81:35 - 81:40)
the company come in and they're just (81:38 - 81:43)
because they're good at what they do (81:40 - 81:44)
um there's going to be (81:43 - 81:46)
in a lot of cases less passion there (81:44 - 81:49)
right people who are coming in as higher (81:46 - 81:51)
executives are very good at doing a (81:49 - 81:52)
thing for a company regardless of what (81:51 - 81:55)
that company is and so there's going to (81:52 - 81:56)
be a lot less passion there then you (81:55 - 81:58)
have people who are like more closely (81:56 - 82:01)
dealing with the customers or dealing (81:58 - 82:03)
with the people or dealing with the (82:01 - 82:05)
product or things like that which I feel (82:03 - 82:06)
like (82:05 - 82:08)
you will find more people who have (82:06 - 82:09)
passion that way and then that creates (82:08 - 82:11)
this like (82:09 - 82:14)
situation where yeah the higher you get (82:11 - 82:16)
in the company I feel like you're gonna (82:14 - 82:18)
have less and less passion about the (82:16 - 82:20)
actual product or what's being put out (82:18 - 82:22)
or the customer experience (82:20 - 82:25)
um as it unless it's at unless it's what (82:22 - 82:28)
relates to Dollars coming in right and (82:25 - 82:30)
so (82:28 - 82:34)
unsurprising to see that with Niantic (82:30 - 82:36)
because that's the same structure you (82:34 - 82:38)
have in a lot of places I feel like (82:36 - 82:42)
um which is unfortunate in a lot of ways (82:38 - 82:43)
and kind of hard to get around (82:42 - 82:46)
unfortunately but yeah I feel like (82:43 - 82:50)
that's not not surprising at all (82:46 - 82:52)
yeah I don't know um (82:50 - 82:54)
I guess we're running a little long I (82:52 - 82:56)
know that (82:54 - 82:59)
Pokemon go related things in Japan are (82:56 - 83:02)
more controlled (82:59 - 83:04)
buy the Pokemon company (83:02 - 83:05)
um (83:04 - 83:07)
makes sense (83:05 - 83:11)
it did feel like a very Niantic event (83:07 - 83:14)
um like it didn't (83:11 - 83:17)
it like (83:14 - 83:17)
if you would have told me like the (83:18 - 83:23)
Pokemon company is more Hands-On for (83:20 - 83:26)
their Japanese events (83:23 - 83:27)
I would be like yeah that makes sense (83:26 - 83:30)
but now actually going to one (83:27 - 83:35)
uh I don't it felt very if if it felt (83:30 - 83:37)
like a go Fest like it didn't feel like (83:35 - 83:40)
extra special like it was still fun like (83:37 - 83:42)
it was still great it was still fun (83:40 - 83:44)
um like the park was gorgeous (83:42 - 83:46)
uh but like (83:44 - 83:49)
I don't I don't know like (83:46 - 83:51)
little things I guess there's like no (83:49 - 83:54)
merch store you could pick up your shirt (83:51 - 83:55)
um that you ordered there's no more (83:54 - 83:57)
chart people are like they could make a (83:55 - 83:59)
killing with Pokemon merch here what (83:57 - 84:01)
like there's a Pokemon Center like down (83:59 - 84:03)
the street like they're already making (84:01 - 84:05)
so many Pokemon centers in Japan right (84:03 - 84:07)
they don't need they need to sell (84:05 - 84:09)
plushes here they're they're sold out (84:07 - 84:12)
like that yeah they got that covered (84:09 - 84:13)
well they want people going they know (84:12 - 84:15)
people oh people are here for Pokemon (84:13 - 84:17)
and there's we have the stores that are (84:15 - 84:20)
nearby like they're gonna go to those (84:17 - 84:23)
stores at some point (84:20 - 84:24)
yeah I (84:23 - 84:26)
didn't hear any issues with London (84:24 - 84:28)
besides rain (84:26 - 84:31)
I didn't hear I don't doesn't sound like (84:28 - 84:32)
they had connection issues doesn't sound (84:31 - 84:35)
like they had uh line issues doesn't (84:32 - 84:38)
sound like they had food issues (84:35 - 84:38)
um maybe that'll spark up (84:38 - 84:44)
this week where people were like I (84:42 - 84:47)
actually my son got pushed into a puddle (84:44 - 84:49)
by a Singaporean grandma that flew like (84:47 - 84:52)
I I don't know I didn't hear any issues (84:49 - 84:55)
I'm very curious how New York will turn (84:52 - 84:56)
out (84:55 - 84:58)
um yeah after these two you didn't get (84:56 - 85:00)
the map we did get the map for the New (84:58 - 85:01)
York event (85:00 - 85:03)
um it is a smaller amount of the park (85:01 - 85:05)
than we expected (85:03 - 85:07)
so that's not the whole island no it's (85:05 - 85:09)
not at all it's just kind of the half of (85:07 - 85:11)
the top half it's almost like a quarter (85:09 - 85:13)
or a third of the island (85:11 - 85:16)
it seems like it's still gonna be plenty (85:13 - 85:18)
big I think there are going to be food (85:16 - 85:20)
trucks (85:18 - 85:22)
uh they're I think two locations for (85:20 - 85:24)
food carts there (85:22 - 85:26)
but (85:24 - 85:28)
yeah it's not as big as I thought it was (85:26 - 85:30)
gonna be and it sounds like that might (85:28 - 85:31)
be a good thing (85:30 - 85:33)
as long as it's big enough can you tell (85:31 - 85:36)
the relation to like what the Japan one (85:33 - 85:38)
is the maps are not the same style (85:36 - 85:40)
between the different go fests I was (85:38 - 85:42)
looking at London's earlier too they're (85:40 - 85:44)
just completely different that's kind of (85:42 - 85:46)
cool in a way I would have to look in (85:44 - 85:49)
the actual world map to look at that (85:46 - 85:51)
bust it out just put it on the wall (85:49 - 85:53)
behind me (85:51 - 85:55)
fired half their Community managers but (85:53 - 85:58)
kept three different map designers (85:55 - 86:02)
I don't know yeah I will say I (85:58 - 86:04)
side note (86:02 - 86:06)
I think the longest I waited in any line (86:04 - 86:09)
besides getting in was like for a coffee (86:06 - 86:12)
at that coffee shop and it was like 10 (86:09 - 86:14)
minutes and when you said food trucks I (86:12 - 86:17)
just think of Vegas where the food (86:14 - 86:20)
trucks were an hour plus weight yeah and (86:17 - 86:22)
the subway across the street was not (86:20 - 86:26)
expecting a event and they ran out of (86:22 - 86:28)
bread so if you wanted to work is on an (86:26 - 86:30)
island and I don't think that there are (86:28 - 86:33)
other food places there (86:30 - 86:35)
so we'll see how that goes I do expect (86:33 - 86:37)
the food trucks to be overrun so (86:35 - 86:38)
probably (86:37 - 86:40)
uh they said that you can bring (86:38 - 86:42)
prepackaged food and water (86:40 - 86:45)
okay so they bring a sandwich bring (86:42 - 86:48)
water yeah I don't think you can bring a (86:45 - 86:50)
sandwich I think it has to be Factory (86:48 - 86:51)
packaged food I don't think they're (86:50 - 86:53)
gonna check bags but I don't know I've (86:51 - 86:55)
never been to a go Fest before bring a (86:53 - 86:59)
Lunchable and bring a water (86:55 - 87:02)
I will tell you for the Japan go Fest (86:59 - 87:05)
there was no big Tech it was walk on in (87:02 - 87:08)
they don't care what you you gotta (87:05 - 87:11)
window fan cool bring it in on like with (87:08 - 87:13)
whatever you want well that's why there (87:11 - 87:15)
was no Lions right or that's why the (87:13 - 87:16)
lion was (87:15 - 87:18)
so short too right there's not they (87:16 - 87:20)
weren't if they're not doing a security (87:18 - 87:22)
check like that yeah (87:20 - 87:26)
um makes speeds things up so uh (87:22 - 87:28)
yeah yeah we'll see how New York goes (87:26 - 87:31)
yeah hopefully if if weather is the (87:28 - 87:32)
biggest issue like that's great for the (87:31 - 87:34)
event just to know that like I mean (87:32 - 87:35)
because you what you can't plan whether (87:34 - 87:37)
I mean you can plan whether but you (87:35 - 87:39)
can't like you know if it's 115 degrees (87:37 - 87:43)
is 115 degrees like it's awful but it's (87:39 - 87:45)
you know not niantics fall over the (87:43 - 87:47)
Pokemon company's fault it just is what (87:45 - 87:50)
it is okay last thing before we had the (87:47 - 87:54)
show I thought Niantic was just bad at (87:50 - 87:56)
planning this I think it's on purpose (87:54 - 87:57)
now (87:56 - 88:00)
they put (87:57 - 88:02)
they put they have they've continued to (88:00 - 88:06)
put the trading area in direct sunlight (88:02 - 88:09)
in no shade uh-huh (88:06 - 88:11)
I thought the first like couple events (88:09 - 88:13)
they were like uh this (88:11 - 88:16)
hey maybe maybe put this in the shade in (88:13 - 88:21)
the future they continue to do it (88:16 - 88:21)
and Seattle go Fest they put the trading (88:21 - 88:26)
area in the dead center of the stadium (88:24 - 88:30)
there wasn't a tree in sight (88:26 - 88:33)
and before that also no shade you'll (88:30 - 88:35)
have to tell me in New York I'm not sure (88:33 - 88:39)
with London but again they put the in an (88:35 - 88:42)
Osaka trading area behind the volcano no (88:39 - 88:46)
trees around it just there was (88:42 - 88:49)
no one is going to also to just find the (88:46 - 88:52)
grandmas just find the grandmas they (88:49 - 88:54)
have the they have the printed out signs (88:52 - 88:55)
trade with those people (88:54 - 88:58)
finally don't (88:55 - 89:00)
don't go to the trading area we'll see (88:58 - 89:01)
if anybody in New York even has (89:00 - 89:03)
laminated signs I'm not sure I expect (89:01 - 89:04)
that (89:03 - 89:06)
do the laminated sign the laminate sign (89:04 - 89:09)
is 100 it's worth it do the laminated (89:06 - 89:12)
sign put what you're offering put what (89:09 - 89:14)
your you want (89:12 - 89:16)
um that's the power play do the laminate (89:14 - 89:18)
sign I feel like you'll get you you have (89:16 - 89:20)
a better chance at getting stuff (89:18 - 89:22)
especially like because I also agree (89:20 - 89:23)
with you I don't think there will be (89:22 - 89:24)
many people in New York with limited (89:23 - 89:27)
sites do the through the laminated sign (89:24 - 89:30)
if you if you want stuff (89:27 - 89:33)
laminate it because what is it like like (89:30 - 89:34)
20 cents that Kinko's I don't know how (89:33 - 89:35)
much (89:34 - 89:38)
