i (1:35 - 1:38)
napped quite a bit today while it was (1:36 - 1:40)
playing we have a uh this is gonna end (1:38 - 1:42)
up being a two-hour show i (1:40 - 1:44)
i try not to have these shows be two (1:42 - 1:46)
hours but there's always like (1:44 - 1:49)
some bit of news that you know we're (1:46 - 1:51)
gonna argue about for way too long (1:49 - 1:53)
and then at the end we just all shrug (1:51 - 1:55)
our shoulders and then (1:53 - 1:58)
yeah that's how we do i mean we don't (1:55 - 2:00)
have to argue about it just (1:58 - 2:02)
take my opinion as right like it is (2:00 - 2:03)
every time (2:02 - 2:06)
and then we can move on oh man greg you (2:03 - 2:07)
sound like my second wife (2:06 - 2:09)
so bad right now i told you i'm trying (2:07 - 2:10)
to stay positive (2:09 - 2:13)
don't sound like amy come on okay (2:10 - 2:15)
we even had a point though i'm sorry (2:13 - 2:17)
joanna was my second wife (2:15 - 2:22)
oh we're in it now (2:17 - 2:24)
we have masters news we have pokemon go (2:22 - 2:26)
news we have (2:24 - 2:29)
pokemon center news we have zarud that's (2:26 - 2:30)
probably one of the big things and then (2:29 - 2:32)
the biggest thing is the pokemon go (2:30 - 2:35)
to home which everyone has a lot of (2:32 - 2:36)
thoughts about (2:35 - 2:39)
let's start off with (2:36 - 2:40)
[Music] (2:39 - 2:42)
let's let's do the pokemon go news first (2:40 - 2:44)
because there's not a lot and then let's (2:42 - 2:45)
go into (2:44 - 2:47)
the pokemon go to home because i think (2:45 - 2:48)
that's our big (2:47 - 2:50)
topic and we might as well just get out (2:48 - 2:52)
of the way off pokemon go live.com (2:50 - 2:56)
there is a limited time test range (2:52 - 2:56)
increase (2:56 - 2:59)
from monday november 16th until monday (2:56 - 3:00)
november 16th so by the time this (2:59 - 3:02)
actually goes up (3:00 - 3:04)
it'll be over but i think it's still (3:02 - 3:05)
worth talking about (3:04 - 3:09)
because this is something that people (3:05 - 3:09)
trainers (3:09 - 3:12)
trainers if you're lucky we will (3:09 - 3:15)
increase the range again in the future (3:12 - 3:18)
ultimately what niantic did is they made (3:15 - 3:19)
it so you can (3:18 - 3:22)
trade up to 10 kilometers which i don't (3:19 - 3:24)
know how many miles that is because (3:22 - 3:27)
i'm american uh 6.2 because a 10k is a (3:24 - 3:28)
6.2 mile race (3:27 - 3:32)
okay uh so you could trade up to 10k so (3:28 - 3:33)
it really lets you trade (3:32 - 3:35)
gosh that's not like a whole city well (3:33 - 3:37)
depends on how big your city is (3:35 - 3:39)
milwaukee is way longer than six miles (3:37 - 3:41)
uh i'm pretty sure (3:39 - 3:43)
greg only lives about five miles away (3:41 - 3:44)
from me and yes (3:43 - 3:47)
he might as well live in east (3:44 - 3:50)
egypt for (3:47 - 3:50)
that's pretty good distance you guys (3:50 - 3:53)
could trade right now (3:52 - 3:56)
we could i got nothing left to trade (3:53 - 3:58)
i've moved everything into pokemon home (3:56 - 4:02)
so that was temporary sure i (3:58 - 4:05)
i i guess they did it because of covid (4:02 - 4:08)
or that'll be the excuse they'll use (4:05 - 4:10)
i mean they should have done it but we (4:08 - 4:12)
know that i don't think trading (4:10 - 4:14)
like i think it's nice i think it's cool (4:12 - 4:16)
that like here's the thing i ain't got (4:14 - 4:17)
no friend (4:16 - 4:19)
i got no friends in the city to trade (4:17 - 4:20)
with (4:19 - 4:22)
there's plenty of podcast listeners in (4:20 - 4:23)
your city (4:22 - 4:25)
so uh yeah there's a couple i don't know (4:23 - 4:27)
if i'm specifically pokemon go friends (4:25 - 4:29)
with them but they did do it in a way (4:27 - 4:30)
where (4:29 - 4:31)
i mean you don't have enough time to (4:30 - 4:34)
become i could have added those people (4:31 - 4:34)
on thursday but (4:34 - 4:36)
by the time this is over i couldn't even (4:34 - 4:38)
become great friends which i think is (4:36 - 4:39)
seven days (4:38 - 4:41)
ten days you gotta you gotta reduce (4:39 - 4:44)
those stardust that stardust cost will (4:41 - 4:47)
ah true so this either leads to two (4:44 - 4:48)
things they either they either do this (4:47 - 4:50)
again and keep it at 10k and that's the (4:48 - 4:51)
new permanent cap (4:50 - 4:55)
or they open it up to be (4:51 - 4:57)
like worldwide temporarily so you can (4:55 - 4:58)
trade others (4:57 - 5:01)
but there's this artificial rarity of (4:58 - 5:04)
you can only get relic camp in new (5:01 - 5:05)
zealand (5:04 - 5:08)
unless you attended the pokemon world's (5:05 - 5:10)
event which was like three days long (5:08 - 5:12)
where relicanth spawned for three days (5:10 - 5:14)
in dc (5:12 - 5:17)
and i i don't think that rarity is bad (5:14 - 5:17)
or (5:17 - 5:20)
not fun because it does at least in my (5:17 - 5:21)
opinion (5:20 - 5:24)
it does get it does make me excited when (5:21 - 5:24)
i see (5:24 - 5:27)
somebody who is well not in 2020. well (5:24 - 5:28)
it (5:27 - 5:30)
did make me excited when i saw somebody (5:28 - 5:31)
traveling from a different country (5:30 - 5:33)
like our friend mark from australia who (5:31 - 5:35)
traded me a kangaskhan on my wedding day (5:33 - 5:37)
which was really cool (5:35 - 5:39)
that was before none of us had (5:37 - 5:40)
kangaskhan (5:39 - 5:41)
it wasn't kangaskhan i'm sorry it was (5:40 - 5:43)
chat i believe cause (5:41 - 5:45)
kangaskhan was in eggs and then chat was (5:43 - 5:47)
the new pokemon sorry mark i forgot what (5:45 - 5:49)
pokemon you traded me on my wedding day (5:47 - 5:52)
it was chat i remember it now (5:49 - 5:56)
congratulations mark mark had some good (5:52 - 5:57)
news recently so i'll just throw (5:56 - 5:59)
congratulations in since we're talking (5:57 - 5:59)
about him (5:59 - 6:01)
i mean people want worldwide trading (5:59 - 6:02)
right yes (6:01 - 6:05)
people want worldwide sale of pokemon (6:02 - 6:06)
which is why we originally (6:05 - 6:08)
suspected the trading was distance (6:06 - 6:10)
limited i'm sure they'll do it again i'm (6:08 - 6:12)
sure this was a test i'm not sure (6:10 - 6:13)
exactly what they were (6:12 - 6:16)
that they're testing like if it worked i (6:13 - 6:17)
guess it worked (6:16 - 6:19)
this is also off pokemon go live city (6:17 - 6:20)

memories with their buddy pokemon (6:39 - 6:42)

to sunday november 22nd but tickets (9:38 - 9:43)

and that that is the event i i i don't (9:43 - 9:48)
know the (9:47 - 9:50)
covid situation but anytime there's an (9:48 - 9:51)
event in a city that's going to be (9:50 - 9:53)
brought up in this day and age (9:51 - 9:56)
but i know new zealand is pretty safe (9:53 - 9:57)
and clear i don't think they have had (9:56 - 9:59)
any cases for the last month (9:57 - 10:01)
um i'm pretty sure south korea is really (9:59 - 10:03)
good yep you're correct (10:01 - 10:05)
that is correct uh yeah south korea has (10:03 - 10:07)
been very good about managing it (10:05 - 10:11)
uh i think japan is pretty okay uh (10:07 - 10:13)
at least i mean i mean in general (10:11 - 10:14)
nowhere is okay (10:13 - 10:16)
yeah i mean we just have to say that (10:14 - 10:19)
right now new zealand also had a spike (10:16 - 10:21)
they've all had spikes their spikes just (10:19 - 10:21)
have not (10:21 - 10:25)
been america's bad as (10:21 - 10:27)
a lot of other places particularly (10:25 - 10:29)
america so (10:27 - 10:31)
like let's be clear they don't have it (10:29 - 10:32)
completely under control (10:31 - 10:36)
they have it under better control it is (10:32 - 10:39)
probably slightly safer but there is (10:36 - 10:40)
still (10:39 - 10:42)
there is still risk there's still risk (10:40 - 10:43)
in all of these places (10:42 - 10:45)
it's less as long as they all remain (10:43 - 10:47)
outside (10:45 - 10:48)
and for new zealand and for a lot of (10:47 - 10:50)
places in the summer hemisphere they're (10:48 - 10:51)
heading into their summer (10:50 - 10:54)
so it is going to be warmer and more (10:51 - 10:55)
likely for them to be outside (10:54 - 10:59)
so it is safer but it's not safe (10:55 - 11:02)
it's not 100 safe so i guess the (10:59 - 11:04)
question is why is niantic even doing (11:02 - 11:04)
this (11:04 - 11:06)
if well i mean it's still an outside (11:04 - 11:08)
oriented event so (11:06 - 11:11)
yeah people can be safe outside yeah it (11:08 - 11:13)
does bring to mind that i've had this (11:11 - 11:14)
weird thing (11:13 - 11:18)
which i have made now maybe i understand (11:14 - 11:18)
a little bit (11:18 - 11:21)
but in my field research i have a little (11:18 - 11:23)
ar mapping thing that says to scan a (11:21 - 11:25)
particular thing and i'm like what (11:23 - 11:29)
what why why does it want me to do that (11:25 - 11:31)
[Laughter] (11:29 - 11:33)
that was like the thing they pulled from (11:31 - 11:35)
harry potter the ar scanning stuff (11:33 - 11:37)
but what's the point i don't know what (11:35 - 11:39)
it does because number one i don't need (11:37 - 11:40)
three potions (11:39 - 11:42)
right i don't know because anytime i (11:40 - 11:44)
spin a pokestop i'm like walking very (11:42 - 11:46)
fast because it's very cold outside so (11:44 - 11:47)
it's like ah (11:46 - 11:48)
you're not keeping me out here for two (11:47 - 11:50)
extra minutes to scan this thing niantic (11:48 - 11:51)
i don't need tenants (11:50 - 11:54)
no it's a field research i mean you do (11:51 - 11:56)
all your field researches no i throw (11:54 - 11:58)
away field researches (11:56 - 12:00)
oh i mean if it's if it's like 10 (11:58 - 12:02)
pokeballs or like three potions i'm (12:00 - 12:03)
throwing it away (12:02 - 12:06)
if it's a pokemon spawn i'll keep it but (12:03 - 12:08)
i don't need any more (12:06 - 12:09)
like right now i have fi catch five (12:08 - 12:11)
pokemon for five (12:09 - 12:12)
pin apps i don't need five pin apps i (12:11 - 12:14)
have 400 of them (12:12 - 12:17)
i i completely deleted every pokeball (12:14 - 12:19)
every potion every revive and every (12:17 - 12:20)
berry (12:19 - 12:22)
that i had in my inventory this morning (12:20 - 12:23)
how wait what (12:22 - 12:25)
how are you gonna oh ukulele deleted the (12:23 - 12:27)
pokeballs not the (12:25 - 12:30)
great balls all no i did all the balls i (12:27 - 12:32)
i i will i guaranteed i will have a (12:30 - 12:33)
hundred of each by (12:32 - 12:35)
this time tomorrow by urban time for (12:33 - 12:37)
community day tomorrow (12:35 - 12:40)
yeah i don't think the city spotlight is (12:37 - 12:42)
the worst thing in the world (12:40 - 12:45)
it's not the worst i mean it's fine i (12:42 - 12:47)
mean go outside (12:45 - 12:50)
be safe not that everyone can go outside (12:47 - 12:53)
but they're not asking you to go into a (12:50 - 12:54)
building they're not asking you to (12:53 - 12:56)
gather in groups it is still (12:54 - 12:59)
pretty i can say my situation is very (12:56 - 13:00)
easy for me to walk down (12:59 - 13:02)
walk out of the house walk to the park (13:00 - 13:03)
not see a single soul (13:02 - 13:05)
maybe see a couple people at the park (13:03 - 13:07)
the park is so big that it's very easy (13:05 - 13:08)
for me to not even (13:07 - 13:10)
come close to those people so i could (13:08 - 13:12)
still (13:10 - 13:15)
play pokemon go very safe at least (13:12 - 13:19)
in milwaukee but where i (13:15 - 13:22)
would prefer to play which is a mall (13:19 - 13:23)
i would not feel comfortable there (13:22 - 13:25)
because one it's indoors two (13:23 - 13:27)
there's a million people there not (13:25 - 13:29)
knowing how to wear masks (13:27 - 13:32)
yep three i definitely i don't want to (13:29 - 13:34)
be in that situation (13:32 - 13:36)
but uh the only reason i would want to (13:34 - 13:37)
go to the mall is because it's (13:36 - 13:41)
uh heated and uh not windy because it's (13:37 - 13:42)
inside it has bathrooms (13:41 - 13:44)
and it has bathrooms and it is getting (13:42 - 13:46)
very cold in wisconsin so it's gonna (13:44 - 13:48)
yeah with the right attitude the world (13:46 - 13:49)
is your bathroom so you don't really (13:48 - 13:50)
need to have that as a (13:49 - 13:54)
criteria but i think i do think (13:50 - 13:57)
i do think the general premise of do (13:54 - 13:59)
go to these pokestops which i think is (13:57 - 14:02)
what the the ideal is (13:59 - 14:04)
like go from this pokestop to this (14:02 - 14:06)
pokestop to this pokestop (14:04 - 14:09)
and then it is giving you a guide to (14:06 - 14:10)
explore the city (14:09 - 14:14)
and probably it would be like ideal if (14:10 - 14:16)
you've never been there before or maybe (14:14 - 14:18)
you don't get out to your downtown area (14:16 - 14:20)
before to like show you parts of the (14:18 - 14:21)
city you might not know (14:20 - 14:23)
i think that definitely exists in (14:21 - 14:24)
ingress although i don't know what it's (14:23 - 14:26)
called (14:24 - 14:27)
so i think niantic just brought this (14:26 - 14:29)
over from ingress (14:27 - 14:32)
there was an app back um gosh like (14:29 - 14:35)
eight years ago it was like when (14:32 - 14:38)
foursquare was blowing up (14:35 - 14:40)
um and i think it was called gowalla and (14:38 - 14:41)
yeah i remember that (14:40 - 14:43)
and that they had experience like that (14:41 - 14:44)
in the app so (14:43 - 14:47)
gowalla was a competition to foursquare (14:44 - 14:50)
except gowalla had these experiences (14:47 - 14:52)
i remember because i was very into koala (14:50 - 14:53)
and when i went to (14:52 - 14:56)
san fran when i went to san francisco (14:53 - 14:57)
for (14:56 - 15:00)
a job thing they had a bunch (14:57 - 15:02)
in that city so what you would do is you (15:00 - 15:03)
would open the app and it would say like (15:02 - 15:05)
here are eight things (15:03 - 15:08)
for you to visit and you would you would (15:05 - 15:10)
go to it and it would show you on the (15:08 - 15:12)
map of like the path to take (15:10 - 15:13)
and then you would check into each one (15:12 - 15:15)
and the idea was like here you've never (15:13 - 15:16)
been here before here's how you (15:15 - 15:18)
experience this part of the city (15:16 - 15:20)
and it was really really cool aren't (15:18 - 15:21)
they coming back (15:20 - 15:25)
they're coming back wallace coming back (15:21 - 15:28)
yeah (15:25 - 15:28)
part of me is excited for this niantic (15:28 - 15:32)
thing because if i (15:30 - 15:35)
do one day travel in the future (15:32 - 15:38)
to like taiwan or kyoto or (15:35 - 15:41)
auckland it would be cool to have an (15:38 - 15:42)
experience like that while playing (15:41 - 15:44)
pokemon go to be like hey you should go (15:42 - 15:45)
to this part of the city and (15:44 - 15:48)
visit these 10 locations and now we (15:45 - 15:49)
think that that's (15:48 - 15:51)
what is worth it for you to see i think (15:49 - 15:52)
that's cool (15:51 - 15:54)
yeah i was a bit just disappointed (15:52 - 15:56)
because they i just the way (15:54 - 15:57)
you know it's it's a news item that i (15:56 - 16:00)
actually read how strange i know (15:57 - 16:01)
and the way that the first part was (16:00 - 16:03)
written it's like coming to many cities (16:01 - 16:05)
it might be coming to your city and then (16:03 - 16:07)
i get to the list of cities and i was (16:05 - 16:08)
like these are weird cities that i've (16:07 - 16:09)
never visited (16:08 - 16:11)
and i don't have a way to get to right (16:09 - 16:13)
now because i don't even have a passport (16:11 - 16:15)
before we get to the go to home stuff (16:13 - 16:17)
mega changes to mega evolution in (16:15 - 16:19)
pokemon go (16:17 - 16:22)
pokemon.com since pokemon go has (16:19 - 16:23)
launched mega evolution (16:22 - 16:25)
in late august trainers have been had (16:23 - 16:27)
the opportunity to collect mega energy (16:25 - 16:28)
by battling in raids the ultimate goal (16:27 - 16:30)
of course is to give yourself an (16:28 - 16:33)
edge in raids by mega evolving select (16:30 - 16:34)
pokemon (16:33 - 16:35)
however the certain aspects of mega (16:34 - 16:37)
evolution require some fine (16:35 - 16:39)
tuning here are some implemented here (16:37 - 16:40)
are some (16:39 - 16:43)
implemented changes to begin with the (16:40 - 16:45)
pokemon that had previously mega evolved (16:43 - 16:46)
now require (16:45 - 16:49)
less mega energy for sub (16:46 - 16:52)
sub subsequent mega evolutions (16:49 - 16:54)
we have also increased the amount of (16:52 - 16:55)
mega energy that a trainer can receive (16:54 - 16:57)
for completing a raid (16:55 - 16:59)
these changes should make it easier to (16:57 - 17:01)
continue mega evolving your pokemon (16:59 - 17:02)
we are implementing additional changes (17:01 - 17:05)
soon including new ways to earn mega (17:02 - 17:06)
evolution (17:05 - 17:08)
mega energy outside of raids soon you'll (17:06 - 17:10)
be able to earn mega energy by walking (17:08 - 17:11)
your buddy (17:10 - 17:14)
or performing research tasks trainers (17:11 - 17:16)
will also receive a bonus of candy when (17:14 - 17:18)
catching a pokemon that is the same (17:16 - 17:21)
type as your mega evolve pokemon in the (17:18 - 17:23)
meantime keep earning mega energy keep a (17:21 - 17:25)
mega evolving and keep being the best (17:23 - 17:26)
trainer you can be i don't think there's (17:25 - 17:28)
any surprise there (17:26 - 17:31)
this is this is the i i (17:28 - 17:33)
i still stand by i said this like two (17:31 - 17:34)
months ago in the podcast (17:33 - 17:37)
that this had nothing to do with (17:34 - 17:38)
trainers complaining (17:37 - 17:41)
this is the same these are the same (17:38 - 17:42)
companies that made like (17:41 - 17:45)
dragon scales and upgrades really hard (17:42 - 17:46)
to get and now (17:45 - 17:48)
they're incredibly easy to get it was (17:46 - 17:50)
really hard to get a cinna stone like (17:48 - 17:52)
two years ago now they hand out cinna (17:50 - 17:54)
stones left and right it's kind of still (17:52 - 17:56)
hard to get you know the stone but i'm (17:54 - 17:57)
sure as soon as (17:56 - 18:00)
bennikin chespin and (17:57 - 18:03)
what's that frog called frookie show up (18:00 - 18:04)
i'm sure (18:03 - 18:07)
what's that frog uh i'm sure younova (18:04 - 18:09)
stones will be easier to get (18:07 - 18:11)
it's just like the pokemon go away oh (18:09 - 18:13)
yeah i mean to make it (18:11 - 18:14)
you know they make it easier for the (18:13 - 18:17)
filthy casuals out there (18:14 - 18:19)
god take advantage of your whales (18:17 - 18:21)
speaking of whales (18:19 - 18:22)
i don't know if that's a good transition (18:21 - 18:24)
where is that but (18:22 - 18:27)
speaking of whalers that's the (18:24 - 18:28)
transition you're looking for this is (18:27 - 18:30)
the press release here (18:28 - 18:33)
media alert pokemon go is now officially (18:30 - 18:35)
connected to pokemon home giving (18:33 - 18:36)
trainers the opportunity to transfer a (18:35 - 18:37)
pokemon (18:36 - 18:40)
from go to home this feature is rolling (18:37 - 18:42)
out to all trainers based on level (18:40 - 18:44)
as of this podcast it is available to (18:42 - 18:46)
everyone trainers will use the new (18:44 - 18:48)
feature in pokemon go called the go (18:46 - 18:51)
transporter to transfer pokemon from (18:48 - 18:54)
to from pokemon go to home every time (18:51 - 18:56)
you transfer a pokemon some energy will (18:54 - 18:57)
be drained (18:56 - 19:00)
from the go transporter the energy used (18:57 - 19:00)
by the go (19:00 - 19:03)
transporter will recharge over time but (19:00 - 19:03)
can (19:03 - 19:06)
be replenished with pokey coins the (19:03 - 19:07)
energy (19:06 - 19:10)
cost depends on the variety of pokemon (19:07 - 19:11)
you're transferring (19:10 - 19:14)
to celebrate trainers who transfer a (19:11 - 19:16)
pokemon from go to home will receive the (19:14 - 19:17)
mythical pokemon mel (19:16 - 19:20)

mel metal will be received through a (19:23 - 19:26)
mystery gift on the mobile device (19:24 - 19:27)

mel (19:31 - 19:34)
metal to sword or shield add it to their (19:32 - 19:36)
team this is the first time (19:34 - 19:37)
giganta max male metal has been (19:36 - 19:39)
available to trainers you couldn't (19:37 - 19:41)
reference you couldn't use mac soup on (19:39 - 19:43)
male metal before (19:41 - 19:45)
and you still can't so don't miss out on (19:43 - 19:46)
this chance to team up with this (19:45 - 19:48)
mythical steel like pokemon (19:46 - 19:50)

trainers can evolve mel tan to mel metal (19:55 - 20:00)
with 400 melting candy (19:57 - 20:04)
that is it's here it was kind of a (20:00 - 20:07)
lackluster launch i guess (20:04 - 20:10)
it kind of came as a surprise there was (20:07 - 20:12)
no like any week this is going to happen (20:10 - 20:13)
it was just like oh wait hey (20:12 - 20:14)
all of a sudden you can do it now (20:13 - 20:16)
suddenly it's here (20:14 - 20:17)
i mean it's before the end of the year (20:16 - 20:19)
which was their requirement (20:17 - 20:20)
i really thought they were going to wait (20:19 - 20:24)
till like two days i did too (20:20 - 20:24)
but they they didn't they what is like (20:25 - 20:30)
what three weeks for crown tundra now (20:28 - 20:35)
yeah okay so uh how do you guys feel (20:30 - 20:36)
about it (20:35 - 20:38)
what's the (20:36 - 20:39)
[Applause] (20:38 - 20:42)
i mean my basic thing and of course this (20:39 - 20:44)
is a very will anderson thing (20:42 - 20:48)
is i have literally read instructions (20:44 - 20:50)
on how to do it and i still can't figure (20:48 - 20:53)
out how to do it (20:50 - 20:53)
and i i'm just frustrated and (20:56 - 21:01)
i'm keep just saying to myself you know (20:59 - 21:03)
what you already have all of these (21:01 - 21:06)
pokemon and pokemon home you don't need (21:03 - 21:09)
no urgency in getting them over but man (21:06 - 21:10)
i'd really like (21:09 - 21:12)
to just be able to touch a pokemon and (21:10 - 21:14)
say send this one to home (21:12 - 21:16)
and it'll say okay you have enough and (21:14 - 21:17)
it'll go (21:16 - 21:20)
but this is the main problem (21:17 - 21:22)
like they like hid the button in the (21:20 - 21:24)
settings menu (21:22 - 21:26)
yeah i mean the buttons hidden in the (21:24 - 21:28)
settings menu the costs are (21:26 - 21:31)
hidden for all intents and purposes like (21:28 - 21:33)
how much things (21:31 - 21:35)
will eat up your transport energy yeah i (21:33 - 21:36)
do have the cost in front that we can (21:35 - 21:38)
talk about but yeah that's not very (21:36 - 21:40)
clear on what costs (21:38 - 21:43)
the refill price is (21:40 - 21:46)
either the most money grabby thing (21:43 - 21:47)
they've ever (21:46 - 21:51)
done or the we actually don't want you (21:47 - 21:53)
to use this feature because it's so (21:51 - 21:55)
stupidly expensive i think it's the (21:53 - 21:56)
latter person i mean (21:55 - 22:00)
that's just for now they'll they'll they (21:56 - 22:02)
probably bring it down at some point (22:00 - 22:03)
they sho (22:02 - 22:08)
it's ridiculous how expensive that is (22:03 - 22:09)
yeah this is this is like a weird (22:08 - 22:11)
conversation because we have to like you (22:09 - 22:13)
can't just talk about the price without (22:11 - 22:14)
acknowledging like (22:13 - 22:18)
what pokemon costs what in energy (22:14 - 22:23)
and that's hidden and it's so ugh (22:18 - 22:26)
and also why writing experience with all (22:23 - 22:28)
the crummy news alerts that this (22:26 - 22:30)
game gives you every time you try to (22:28 - 22:31)
start and just like i just (22:30 - 22:33)
want to start the game so i can send (22:31 - 22:36)
some gifts i don't need half an hour of (22:33 - 22:39)
eggs opening and this alert and that (22:36 - 22:40)
alert and (22:39 - 22:42)
why did they not send me a little news (22:40 - 22:43)
alert saying hey (22:42 - 22:46)
it's it's here and here's how you do it (22:43 - 22:48)
you guys just telling me that i had to (22:46 - 22:49)
go into settings (22:48 - 22:51)
that every instruction that i read on (22:49 - 22:52)
how to do this was (22:51 - 22:53)
well you have to be signed into your (22:52 - 22:55)
nintendo account (22:53 - 22:58)
okay nobody said go here decided i was (22:55 - 22:59)
like of course i'm signed into my (22:58 - 23:01)
nintendo account i live there (22:59 - 23:03)
yeah this is this has to be like a (23:01 - 23:05)
japanese pokemon thing because (23:03 - 23:07)
they they launched it they launched it (23:05 - 23:08)
at like (23:07 - 23:12)
5 p.m central time on tuesday because i (23:08 - 23:14)
got access to it right away (23:12 - 23:16)
and i was like well i'm going to start (23:14 - 23:17)
my twitch stream early (23:16 - 23:20)
because uh that is going to be the talk (23:17 - 23:21)
of the night of (23:20 - 23:23)
like we can do this now how do you do (23:21 - 23:24)
this what did you transfer how much does (23:23 - 23:26)
it cost what's going on (23:24 - 23:30)
they didn't tweet they as in niantic and (23:26 - 23:32)
the pokemon company didn't tweet or (23:30 - 23:34)
didn't put out anything official (23:32 - 23:38)
until like 11 p.m central time which is (23:34 - 23:42)
9 00 p.m pacific and then that is like (23:38 - 23:45)
it was what like uh noon in japan or (23:42 - 23:46)
something (23:45 - 23:48)
so they didn't do anything until japan (23:46 - 23:49)
said like (23:48 - 23:52)
hey this is this is ready to go so (23:49 - 23:56)
for almost for six hours (23:52 - 23:58)
it was available to level 40 but like no (23:56 - 24:00)
information existed (23:58 - 24:03)
besides figure it out yourself which for (24:00 - 24:04)
me it was it was pretty easy (24:03 - 24:06)
to figure out um but if you were like (24:04 - 24:07)
level 38 (24:06 - 24:09)
and you saw all these other people doing (24:07 - 24:11)
it and people are like (24:09 - 24:12)
and people are like well you got to go (24:11 - 24:13)
into your settings and you got to (24:12 - 24:15)
connect your nintendo account (24:13 - 24:18)
and that didn't appear uh like i (24:15 - 24:22)
understood because i we've been covering (24:18 - 24:24)
this dumb game for four years (24:22 - 24:26)
that it was that it was a slow rollout (24:24 - 24:28)
right i don't think (24:26 - 24:31)
i don't think most hardcore pokemon go (24:28 - 24:32)
players (24:31 - 24:33)
thought it was going to be restricted to (24:32 - 24:35)
level 40. i think most of us (24:33 - 24:36)
most of us who have been playing this (24:35 - 24:38)
game for a long time was like okay this (24:36 - 24:39)
is how they always do it (24:38 - 24:41)
when they did trading it was level 40 (24:39 - 24:42)
yeah when they did battles it was level (24:41 - 24:43)
40 when they did (24:42 - 24:46)
raids it was level 40. but if you are a (24:43 - 24:48)
casual pokemon go player (24:46 - 24:50)
and you see that people are doing this (24:48 - 24:52)
and you're level 32 (24:50 - 24:54)
you're like where's my button what am i (24:52 - 24:56)
doing and so i was there on a twitch (24:54 - 24:58)
stream helping those people but not (24:56 - 24:58)
every (24:58 - 25:00)
unfortunately as it turns out not the (24:58 - 25:02)
entire world watches my twitch stream (25:00 - 25:04)
so they're on twitter being like i don't (25:02 - 25:05)
know what's happening they're on reddit (25:04 - 25:06)
being like what's going on (25:05 - 25:08)
why can't i do this now that everyone (25:06 - 25:09)
can do it (25:08 - 25:12)
that's fine and as of that evenings you (25:09 - 25:14)
know six hours after they launch it they (25:12 - 25:14)
go (25:14 - 25:17)
hey this is now available i don't (25:14 - 25:19)
understand why this button (25:17 - 25:22)
is hidden under the system settings (25:19 - 25:24)
but i i mean so i went in i just saw (25:22 - 25:25)
that it was available (25:24 - 25:28)
i went in i looked everywhere (25:25 - 25:31)
and i'm like well it's not here so then (25:28 - 25:32)
i checked to see if there was an (25:31 - 25:35)
update like in the absence of (25:32 - 25:38)
official information like there wasn't (25:35 - 25:41)
i mean i could have stopped for and i (25:38 - 25:42)
did think oh (25:41 - 25:43)
after i checked everyone knows i'm like (25:42 - 25:45)
oh this has to be restricted (25:43 - 25:48)
but since i didn't have that information (25:45 - 25:49)
up front (25:48 - 25:51)
and people like and there were a few (25:49 - 25:53)
things like hey it's out now (25:51 - 25:55)
and nobody's saying but it's restricted (25:53 - 25:57)
i did spend some time thinking (25:55 - 26:01)
is it broken am i missing it (25:57 - 26:04)
like i'm looking at screenshots and it's (26:01 - 26:06)
just not there and then eventually i'm (26:04 - 26:08)
like oh (26:06 - 26:11)
it is probably restricted to level 40s (26:08 - 26:14)
but they could have said something i'm (26:11 - 26:15)
assuming (26:14 - 26:18)
niantic couldn't say anything until the (26:15 - 26:20)
pokemon company tweeted first which is (26:18 - 26:21)
what (26:20 - 26:24)
happened the pokemon japanese account (26:21 - 26:25)
tweeted first (26:24 - 26:28)
then niantic tweeted then the english (26:25 - 26:29)
account tweeted (26:28 - 26:33)
but it was weird that they turned it on (26:29 - 26:38)
six hours before their tweet (26:33 - 26:39)
this company is just horrible about (26:38 - 26:41)
communicating things that's just fun (26:39 - 26:42)
they (26:41 - 26:45)
just need to hire me i'm i'm fantastic (26:42 - 26:47)
at communicating come on folks (26:45 - 26:49)
okay so before we get to the energy cost (26:47 - 26:51)
a couple things there are two pokemon (26:49 - 26:54)
specifically you cannot transfer um one (26:51 - 26:55)
is spinda (26:54 - 26:57)
and the other is there's more than two (26:55 - 26:59)
but yeah the other (26:57 - 27:03)
is black kirum slash white kirum you can (26:59 - 27:06)
transfer kirum but you cannot tran well (27:03 - 27:07)
black hair and white kieran technically (27:06 - 27:09)
aren't in the games but (27:07 - 27:11)
for whatever reason you cannot transfer (27:09 - 27:13)
those and you cannot transfer spinda (27:11 - 27:15)
the other things you cannot transfer the (27:13 - 27:17)
thing is just weird (27:15 - 27:19)
i mean assuming it has to do with the (27:17 - 27:20)
dot pattern (27:19 - 27:22)
right because there's like three billion (27:20 - 27:23)
spindas but there's only like nine of (27:22 - 27:25)
them and pokemon go (27:23 - 27:28)
and i guess they don't want those nine (27:25 - 27:29)
to be (27:28 - 27:33)
common and sword and like i don't i mean (27:29 - 27:34)
they're not in sword and shield right (27:33 - 27:37)
that's true i mean you could (27:34 - 27:40)
it's it's you could randomize them when (27:37 - 27:41)
you transfer them but then people would (27:40 - 27:44)
be mad i guess that they (27:41 - 27:46)
changed absolutely they would be mad but (27:44 - 27:47)
like you know they had to (27:46 - 27:50)
know the only thing i think of is they (27:47 - 27:52)
are trying to figure out (27:50 - 27:56)
what random string present makes that (27:52 - 27:58)
pattern and then we'll finally feed that (27:56 - 28:00)
to niantic sonanda can lock it in when (27:58 - 28:01)
it moves (28:00 - 28:03)
i guess their goal is like we don't want (28:01 - 28:05)
two spindles to be exactly the same (28:03 - 28:07)
but two spindles can be exactly the same (28:05 - 28:09)
and that was the whole point in pokemon (28:07 - 28:11)
go was like i can collect all the (28:09 - 28:12)
patterns (28:11 - 28:15)
right and i mean see this is where like (28:12 - 28:16)
pokemon go mentality (28:15 - 28:19)
fights with the other pokemon games (28:16 - 28:20)
mentality because (28:19 - 28:23)
in a traditional pokemon game it's i (28:20 - 28:25)
will get random spinda hopefully i enjoy (28:23 - 28:26)
the pattern (28:25 - 28:28)
and in pokemon go it was like there are (28:26 - 28:29)
these nine patterns (28:28 - 28:31)
i must collect all nine of these (28:29 - 28:33)
patterns i mean people saying that they (28:31 - 28:34)
can't be two spinders are the same (28:33 - 28:35)
people say that there can't be two (28:34 - 28:36)
snowflakes (28:35 - 28:38)
that are the same there can be i mean (28:36 - 28:40)
yeah there can be but the likelihood of (28:38 - 28:41)
you (28:40 - 28:44)
finding them is rare (28:41 - 28:47)
because but ice crystals only grow in a (28:44 - 28:49)
certain pattern (28:47 - 28:51)
and there is an institute that (28:49 - 28:52)
determines (28:51 - 28:54)
spin to spots so they need to figure (28:52 - 28:56)
that out and lock it into place (28:54 - 28:58)
or they're just going to keep it trapped (28:56 - 29:00)
and go forever (28:58 - 29:02)
it's just a yeah isn't it a big deal (29:00 - 29:04)
it's just a weird (29:02 - 29:06)
it's a weird thing on top of a bunch of (29:04 - 29:07)
other weird things that they did (29:06 - 29:10)
look i don't i mean there's only (29:07 - 29:11)
probably like two people out there in (29:10 - 29:13)
the entire world that are upset that (29:11 - 29:14)
their spin (29:13 - 29:16)
cannot be moved over and one of them is (29:14 - 29:18)
a really good friend of mine (29:16 - 29:21)
and i'm sure oh that dude's never played (29:18 - 29:23)
pokemon go i'm sure that they're (29:21 - 29:25)
actually mad that's not true (29:23 - 29:26)
but can we talk about the real issue (29:25 - 29:28)
here which is (29:26 - 29:31)
i can't move any of my hat pikachus yeah (29:28 - 29:33)
well we knew that was coming they (29:31 - 29:36)
they said like a month ago that most (29:33 - 29:38)
costumes won't be moved over (29:36 - 29:40)
but i refuse to accept this i refuse (29:38 - 29:41)
that that (29:40 - 29:45)
is in so many games and in home (29:41 - 29:47)
i mean you can move cosplay pikachu and (29:45 - 29:48)
auras (29:47 - 29:52)
yeah but okay the annoying thing is (29:48 - 29:56)
that of all the pokemon in the universe (29:52 - 29:59)
the ones that make that are like these (29:56 - 30:00)
are (29:59 - 30:03)
real special pokemon go pokemon that (30:00 - 30:05)
it's like i would want to have in (30:03 - 30:08)
pokemon home with my collection of my (30:05 - 30:10)
all this pokemon that i love and adore (30:08 - 30:14)
are the costume ones yeah (30:10 - 30:17)
otherwise it's just like i i mean i just (30:14 - 30:18)
moved a shiny pikachu (30:17 - 30:21)
and i'm like all right great shiny (30:18 - 30:22)
pikachu (30:21 - 30:24)
i could have read that myself in any (30:22 - 30:27)
number of different pokemon games (30:24 - 30:30)
but a witch hat pikachu no i only got (30:27 - 30:32)
that in pokemon go (30:30 - 30:35)
let the witch hat pikachu free i mean (30:32 - 30:36)
they could it could happen at a later (30:35 - 30:39)
date i'm like (30:36 - 30:41)
hit and miss on the hat pikachu stuff (30:39 - 30:43)
because part of me is like (30:41 - 30:45)
it'd be cool if you can move them over (30:43 - 30:47)
but part of me is like it's just gonna (30:45 - 30:48)
sit there in a box and collect dust (30:47 - 30:50)
because it's not like i'm actually like (30:48 - 30:50)
i (30:50 - 30:53)
have all of the hat pikachus from sun (30:50 - 30:54)
and moon (30:53 - 30:56)
when they did the like ash hat pikachu (30:54 - 30:58)
stuff i have not redeemed (30:56 - 30:59)
by the way redeem your happy choose for (30:58 - 31:01)
sword and shield you have uh (30:59 - 31:04)
as of this podcast 15 days but not (31:01 - 31:07)
once have i moved those hat pikachus (31:04 - 31:08)
into sun and moon (31:07 - 31:10)
ultra sun and moon sword and shield to (31:08 - 31:12)
be like let me look at these pikachu (31:10 - 31:14)
like i redeemed them they went into my (31:12 - 31:16)
box they have been sitting there for (31:14 - 31:17)
three years (31:16 - 31:20)
i have never looked at them again (31:17 - 31:20)
all hat pikachu competitive team so i (31:20 - 31:25)
kind of feel the same way about like (31:23 - 31:28)
as much as i do like collecting the the (31:25 - 31:29)
the (31:28 - 31:31)
bulbasaur with the cubone skull and the (31:29 - 31:32)
pikachu with the wish hat (31:31 - 31:36)
which hat like i'm fine that they can't (31:32 - 31:36)
be moved over (31:36 - 31:39)
now it'd be nice if they can move over (31:36 - 31:41)
in the future but like right now i don't (31:39 - 31:43)
think it's the end of the world (31:41 - 31:48)
if they can't figure out spinda (31:43 - 31:48)
what i can say is that if you move over (31:51 - 31:55)
your cast form because in pokemon go you (31:53 - 31:56)
can collect all (31:55 - 31:58)
five versions of cast form it will (31:56 - 32:00)
default to normal cast form if you move (31:58 - 32:02)
over your cherum it will default to (32:00 - 32:05)
overcast if you move over to geratina it (32:02 - 32:06)
will (32:05 - 32:08)
change it to altered your zen (32:06 - 32:10)
darmanitans will change to galler (32:08 - 32:12)
your if there's no keldio in the game (32:10 - 32:14)
but the data miner says if you move your (32:12 - 32:16)
keldeo resolute it will turn into kelvio (32:14 - 32:18)
ordinary no melody in the game but if (32:16 - 32:19)
you move (32:18 - 32:21)
melodies i don't know what that word (32:19 - 32:22)
means it will (32:21 - 32:25)
pirouette melody aria (32:22 - 32:29)
is a dance style and ballot oh okay (32:25 - 32:32)
so forms will revert uh (32:29 - 32:36)
lucky and purified pokemon will lose (32:32 - 32:38)
their lucky and purified statuses which (32:36 - 32:39)
i think (32:38 - 32:41)
going back to the hat pikachu i think (32:39 - 32:43)
this is more important than the hats (32:41 - 32:45)
i think lucky pokemon is something that (32:43 - 32:47)
they should bring to the main series (32:45 - 32:49)
games because it would encourage trading (32:47 - 32:51)
obviously that doesn't exist yet but i i (32:49 - 32:53)
personally hope in future games lucky is (32:51 - 32:55)
a thing that carries over to (32:53 - 32:57)
remix or gen 9 or gen 10 or something i (32:55 - 32:59)
think that's like a really cool mechanic (32:57 - 33:01)
pokemon you you send from home cannot be (32:59 - 33:03)
moved back you know that (33:01 - 33:06)
uh when you do move by pokemon to (33:03 - 33:09)
home from a go and then go to sword and (33:06 - 33:11)
shield the pokemon absorbs the (33:09 - 33:14)
the trainer id that home is set in (33:11 - 33:17)
uh not go and the other thing is (33:14 - 33:21)
if you nickname a pokemon in go for (33:17 - 33:23)
example if you nickname it like trademe (33:21 - 33:25)
and then you send it to home it removes (33:23 - 33:26)
the nickname (33:25 - 33:29)
when you move that to sword and shield (33:26 - 33:30)
uh you can (33:29 - 33:32)
change the nickname once because it (33:30 - 33:33)
defaults (33:32 - 33:36)
like if you traded an axle with you know (33:33 - 33:37)
the nickname was (33:36 - 33:40)
whatever it changes it back to absol in (33:37 - 33:41)
home when you move it to sword and (33:40 - 33:42)
shield you can take it to the nickname (33:41 - 33:44)
guy he'll say like you this is not your (33:42 - 33:46)
pokemon you can only nickname it once (33:44 - 33:48)
are you sure you want to change it (33:46 - 33:52)
so i tested all that uh i believe (33:48 - 33:54)
also i'm looking at this chart of (33:52 - 33:56)
everything that we need to cover (33:54 - 33:58)
pokemon with a ribbon so if you earn (33:56 - 33:59)
like the (33:58 - 34:00)
buddy is what is it called the buddy (33:59 - 34:02)
ribbon if you earn the buddy ribbon on a (34:00 - 34:04)
pokemon and you transfer (34:02 - 34:06)
that from go to home uh it loses the (34:04 - 34:07)
ribbon (34:06 - 34:08)
pretty much it loses ribbon it loses (34:07 - 34:10)
lucky it loses uh (34:08 - 34:12)
purified shadow pokemon you can't even (34:10 - 34:14)
transfer you have to purify them before (34:12 - 34:15)
you transfer (34:14 - 34:17)
you cannot transfer your buddy pokemon (34:15 - 34:19)
is when it's equipped as your buddy you (34:17 - 34:20)
have to unequip it (34:19 - 34:22)
unequip it what is this magic the (34:20 - 34:24)
gathering (34:22 - 34:24)
you can't move a mega evolution you (34:25 - 34:29)
can't move a pokemon that's defending a (34:27 - 34:30)
gym (34:29 - 34:32)
i think those are pretty obvious you get (34:30 - 34:34)
the mystery box (34:32 - 34:35)
okay i think that covers all the (34:34 - 34:37)
mechanics the the (34:35 - 34:40)
the debate the the point of contention (34:37 - 34:41)
here (34:40 - 34:44)
is the transporter energy so they (34:41 - 34:45)
introduced an item called the (34:44 - 34:46)
transporter the transporter is what you (34:45 - 34:48)
use to move from point a to point b (34:46 - 34:50)
the transporter has this huge bar with (34:48 - 34:52)
no numbers on it that there is a secret (34:50 - 34:53)
hidden number which is ten (34:52 - 34:55)
thousand if you transfer some pokemon (34:53 - 34:57)
that bar gets lowered (34:55 - 34:59)
they don't tell you what a pokemon is (34:57 - 35:01)
worth because the pokemon company i (34:59 - 35:03)
guess hates numbers i don't know (35:01 - 35:05)
yeah and they don't tell you how much (35:03 - 35:07)
energy you earn (35:05 - 35:10)
but you get 10 000 and you earn 60 an (35:07 - 35:13)
hour which is one a minute pokemon (35:10 - 35:16)
are worth something so a let's just say (35:13 - 35:18)
it's a let's just say you're (35:16 - 35:21)
you have a b doof a b doof (35:18 - 35:24)
just you know maybe 13 c p b doof is (35:21 - 35:24)
worth (35:24 - 35:28)
10 energy so ideally if you're the (35:24 - 35:28)
biggest b (35:28 - 35:30)
do fan in the world and you've caught (35:28 - 35:32)
every b do if you've seen (35:30 - 35:35)
you can transfer a thousand b-dupes a (35:32 - 35:36)
week (35:35 - 35:39)
which is a lot of b-dupes there's a lot (35:36 - 35:40)
of doof (35:39 - 35:41)
and i think what we were maybe (35:40 - 35:43)
suggesting or talking about (35:41 - 35:46)
a couple weeks ago is maybe they only (35:43 - 35:48)
let you transfer 10 pokemon a week (35:46 - 35:50)
and when i asked my twitch chat when we (35:48 - 35:52)
asked slack and when i asked on (35:50 - 35:54)
instagram and when i asked on twitter (35:52 - 35:55)
a lot of people were like hey if it lets (35:54 - 35:57)
me do 10 pokemon a week i'm (35:55 - 35:59)
happy for free because we knew there was (35:57 - 36:01)
going to be a cost (35:59 - 36:04)
for quote unquote normal pokemon (36:01 - 36:06)
your deerlings your magnemites your (36:04 - 36:07)
bulbasaurs your charmanders your (36:06 - 36:09)
beedoofs (36:07 - 36:12)
you can do anywhere between 300 (36:09 - 36:15)
to a thousand a week which is a lot of (36:12 - 36:16)
pokemon (36:15 - 36:18)
yeah i feel like people don't care about (36:16 - 36:19)
that (36:18 - 36:22)
well they made it complicated though (36:19 - 36:23)
right (36:22 - 36:26)
because they added the cp (36:23 - 36:29)
right that's where they add to the cost (36:26 - 36:30)
yeah so (36:29 - 36:33)
the reason i said between 3 300 to 1 000 (36:30 - 36:35)
is because if it's under (36:33 - 36:40)
if it's under 1000 cp (36:35 - 36:42)
yep it's a thousand or less that it's (36:40 - 36:43)
ten (36:42 - 36:45)
but if it's above a thousand there's (36:43 - 36:46)
like a (36:45 - 36:48)
like a hundred there's like a hundred (36:46 - 36:50)
extra cost so instead of it being ten (36:48 - 36:52)
transporter energy it's a hundred and (36:50 - 36:54)
ten transporter energy (36:52 - 36:56)
and then if it's like a charizard not (36:54 - 37:00)
regular charizard at like 2500 cp (36:56 - 37:03)
anything over 2 000 gets a 300 extra (37:00 - 37:04)
cost (37:03 - 37:07)
ultimately what this means is a normal b (37:04 - 37:07)
doof (37:07 - 37:09)
is either going to be 10 energy to (37:07 - 37:12)
transfer 110 energy to transfer (37:09 - 37:15)
or 310 energy to transfer depending (37:12 - 37:18)
if it has cp under a thousand (37:15 - 37:20)
a thousand two two thousand or two (37:18 - 37:21)
thousand plus (37:20 - 37:23)
which is this weird hidden cost that (37:21 - 37:25)
they don't really talk about yep (37:23 - 37:27)
but for the most part it's worse 300 (37:25 - 37:29)
pokemon a week (37:27 - 37:31)
is still a lot of pokemon it's still a (37:29 - 37:33)
lot i mean if you're just wanting to (37:31 - 37:35)
clear out your storage that's fine (37:33 - 37:36)
if you're wanting to clear out your (37:35 - 37:38)
storage it's fine if you if you have a (37:36 - 37:40)
a living dex which i i think a lot of (37:38 - 37:42)
hardcore go players do if you have a (37:40 - 37:43)
living dex from (37:42 - 37:46)
bulbasaur to hirom (37:43 - 37:49)
i guess right well there's a couple gen (37:46 - 37:50)
five missing (37:49 - 37:53)
uh you know uh calculator missing but (37:50 - 37:55)
you can technically (37:53 - 37:58)
move all your non-legendary non-mythical (37:55 - 37:59)
pokemon from (37:58 - 38:03)
gen one to gen five in an instant (37:59 - 38:05)
i mean besides like tapping the button (38:03 - 38:07)
to highlight them all like you can move (38:05 - 38:11)
500 plus pokemon in a day which is (38:07 - 38:13)
to fill out your living decks which is (38:11 - 38:14)
pretty awesome (38:13 - 38:17)
in my opinion where it gets complicated (38:14 - 38:18)
where people started to (38:17 - 38:22)
get mad at this is three different types (38:18 - 38:23)
of pokemon (38:22 - 38:26)
four i should say well and there's a you (38:23 - 38:28)
left out the shiny cost (38:26 - 38:30)
oh that's what i'm about to talk so (38:28 - 38:31)
there is (38:30 - 38:33)
mythical pokemon which have a different (38:31 - 38:35)
cost than legendary pokemon (38:33 - 38:38)
uh which which those two costs pretty (38:35 - 38:40)
they're both pretty expensive which i (38:38 - 38:41)
think the three of us would agree that (38:40 - 38:43)
mythical and legendary pokemon should be (38:41 - 38:45)
more expensive than a b doof (38:43 - 38:47)
i don't think anyone's sure debating (38:45 - 38:48)
that and then (38:47 - 38:51)
there is a shiny pokemon uh which has (38:48 - 38:53)
its own cost and then there's the final (38:51 - 38:54)
cost (38:53 - 38:56)
of a shiny pokemon that is legendary and (38:54 - 38:57)
or (38:56 - 39:00)
mythical they're technically different (38:57 - 39:01)
costs but ultimately they're (39:00 - 39:03)
they're pretty the same we'll get to (39:01 - 39:05)
that so (39:03 - 39:07)
a regular pokemon is going to cost you (39:05 - 39:08)
between 10 (39:07 - 39:12)
transport energy to 310 transport energy (39:08 - 39:15)
and you have 10 000. and then when you (39:12 - 39:17)
get to (39:15 - 39:20)
a mythical pokemon or a legendary (39:17 - 39:22)
pokemon a legendary pokemon will cost (39:20 - 39:22)
you (39:22 - 39:25)
a thousand transport energy so (39:22 - 39:29)
ideally you could transfer 10 (39:25 - 39:32)
legendary pokemon a week but (39:29 - 39:34)
of course the cp comes into play if the (39:32 - 39:36)
legendary pokemon is above (39:34 - 39:40)
1000 cp then it becomes (39:36 - 39:42)
a little bit more expensive and then if (39:40 - 39:44)
it's above 2000 cp (39:42 - 39:46)
it becomes a little bit more expensive (39:44 - 39:47)
so let's just say for the sake of this (39:46 - 39:49)
conversation you can move about six (39:47 - 39:50)
legendary pokemon a week (39:49 - 39:53)
i think that's the average um from what (39:50 - 39:54)
from everything i tested all the (39:53 - 39:56)
combinations of selecting articunos or (39:54 - 39:57)
selecting heat trans or selecting (39:56 - 39:59)
cresselias or selecting (39:57 - 40:02)
some kyogres and some heat trans so you (39:59 - 40:04)
can do about six legendaries a week (40:02 - 40:06)
maybe seven if you have some cheaper (40:04 - 40:08)
mythical pokemon of a base cost of two (40:06 - 40:10)
thousand so they're twice as expensive (40:08 - 40:11)
as legendary that (40:10 - 40:13)
i guess makes sense mythical pokemon are (40:11 - 40:15)
more rare than legendary that's the (40:13 - 40:17)
really the main difference here and (40:15 - 40:18)
again there's some different costs so if (40:17 - 40:21)
the mythical is above 2000 or above (40:18 - 40:22)
whatever it costs a little bit more (40:21 - 40:25)
expensive this all makes sense (40:22 - 40:29)
and then we get shiny pokemon (40:25 - 40:32)
which have its own cost so a shiny (40:29 - 40:33)
pokemon (40:32 - 40:38)
will be base 2000 (40:33 - 40:41)
technically yeah so we'll just say base (40:38 - 40:41)
2000 (40:41 - 40:44)
so if you could move about six legendary (40:41 - 40:45)
a week (40:44 - 40:48)
you can maybe move about four to five (40:45 - 40:50)
mythical a week (40:48 - 40:52)
and then that kind of lines up with (40:50 - 40:54)
shiny pokemon which is shiny pokemon you (40:52 - 40:56)
can maybe move about (40:54 - 40:58)
five you could technically move five a (40:56 - 40:59)
week there's a weird reason why this (40:58 - 41:00)
works but for the sake of the (40:59 - 41:02)
conversation right now we'll say you can (41:00 - 41:04)
move about five shiny pokemon a week (41:02 - 41:07)
and then a shiny is safer to say four (41:04 - 41:09)
because of the cp cost (41:07 - 41:12)
yeah you can for sure almost always move (41:09 - 41:14)
four (41:12 - 41:17)
okay but yeah if you have a really high (41:14 - 41:20)
cp shiny like non-legendary are you (41:17 - 41:21)
really moving that (41:20 - 41:24)
or are you keeping that for like raids (41:21 - 41:26)
cause who's powering up shinies (41:24 - 41:29)
you don't know me yeah i guess like greg (41:26 - 41:29)
actually (41:29 - 41:32)
checks the value of a pokemon after he (41:29 - 41:33)
catches it and i'm like why are you (41:32 - 41:35)
wasting your time (41:33 - 41:37)
i only have like live your life maybe (41:35 - 41:40)
like 10 shinies that have powered max up (41:37 - 41:40)
but (41:40 - 41:42)
that's because their stats were good and (41:40 - 41:44)
i planned to keep them and go forever (41:42 - 41:45)
because of (41:44 - 41:48)
raid carries i guess i don't know (41:45 - 41:49)
i guess yeah you could have a lot of (41:48 - 41:51)
maybe you just like powering up (41:49 - 41:53)
shinies but you didn't no one knew that (41:51 - 41:55)
there was going to be this weird cost (41:53 - 41:58)
based off cp so the the uh (41:55 - 42:00)
the last exception so we talked about (41:58 - 42:02)
legendaries let's say maybe (42:00 - 42:04)
uh six a week shinies about four to five (42:02 - 42:05)
a week (42:04 - 42:06)
technically more because you don't have (42:05 - 42:07)
to wait a full week to start (42:06 - 42:09)
transferring again (42:07 - 42:11)
um mythical is about four a week and (42:09 - 42:12)
then there's the (42:11 - 42:14)
last one that i think this is the one (42:12 - 42:16)
that made people very very angry (42:14 - 42:19)
which was the shiny legendary shiny (42:16 - 42:20)
mythical (42:19 - 42:23)
which costs the entire ten thousand (42:20 - 42:25)
it takes the whole bar so you can only (42:23 - 42:27)
do one of those a week (42:25 - 42:29)
and that is that is the transporter in a (42:27 - 42:31)
nutshell and i think because of that (42:29 - 42:32)
last one that we brought up (42:31 - 42:35)
one mythic shiny mythical one shiny (42:32 - 42:36)
legendary a week (42:35 - 42:38)
i think people don't care about the (42:36 - 42:39)
other stuff we talked about which is (42:38 - 42:40)
like hey you could move (42:39 - 42:45)
300 to 000 plus cp badoofs (42:40 - 42:47)
in an instant like people don't care (42:45 - 42:48)
about that because those pokemon are (42:47 - 42:49)
common (42:48 - 42:52)
they might already have them they they (42:49 - 42:53)
really want to focus on their (42:52 - 42:55)
their legendaries their mythicals their (42:53 - 42:56)
shinies (42:55 - 43:00)
which are the rarest pokemon in these (42:56 - 43:03)
games it's kind of like the trophies (43:00 - 43:04)
that you hunt for (43:03 - 43:06)
i guess the majority of people that are (43:04 - 43:08)
complaining are unhappy that they can (43:06 - 43:09)
only move like (43:08 - 43:12)
five shiny pokemon at a time (43:09 - 43:15)
and i guess my thought process is i (43:12 - 43:16)
think a shiny (43:15 - 43:19)
should be worth a lot in in comparison (43:16 - 43:21)
to a hundred bidoofs (43:19 - 43:23)
uh especially since like a shiny is like (43:21 - 43:24)
what (43:23 - 43:26)
most people have reported or the silph (43:24 - 43:28)
road is reported like as shiny as (43:26 - 43:32)
one out of 450 minus community day stuff (43:28 - 43:36)
right which is only existed for three (43:32 - 43:37)
hours and then it goes back to the one (43:36 - 43:39)
in 450 or whatever it is (43:37 - 43:43)
i think shinies should be a lot (43:39 - 43:46)
i think that chinese should cost more (43:43 - 43:47)
than legendaries (43:46 - 43:50)
personally because even (43:47 - 43:53)
in main series games you are guaranteed (43:50 - 43:54)
legendaries just (43:53 - 43:56)
by playing you are not guaranteed (43:54 - 43:57)
chinese (43:56 - 44:00)
while in a main series game you will (43:57 - 44:02)
only get the one mewtwo you will only (44:00 - 44:04)
get the one kyogre you will only get the (44:02 - 44:05)
one groudon (44:04 - 44:07)
through your playthrough you could (44:05 - 44:09)
restart your game (44:07 - 44:11)
and get a second one but that's time (44:09 - 44:12)
consuming (44:11 - 44:15)
you know i played pokemon for 18 years (44:12 - 44:17)
before i got my first shiny (44:15 - 44:19)
in a main series game so i would argue (44:17 - 44:22)
that legendary should be expensive (44:19 - 44:23)
but chinese should also be more (44:22 - 44:25)
expensive and then (44:23 - 44:28)
ultimately your grand trophy would be (44:25 - 44:30)
a shiny legendary which would be the (44:28 - 44:32)
most expensive so i think in a hierarchy (44:30 - 44:34)
of costs (44:32 - 44:37)
i think the order is correct like i (44:34 - 44:39)
think a shiny should be worth more than (44:37 - 44:41)
a legendary (44:39 - 44:44)
which i think is how the math works out (44:41 - 44:47)
yeah and it does and a mythical should (44:44 - 44:48)
be (44:47 - 44:51)
about the same cost as a shiny but a (44:48 - 44:52)
shiny legendary (44:51 - 44:54)
mythical should be the most expensive i (44:52 - 44:55)
just don't think people are (44:54 - 44:58)
happy with that in the sense of like (44:55 - 45:00)
well i can only move five and i have 400 (44:58 - 45:02)
chinese so it's gonna take me all year (45:00 - 45:02)
to move that (45:02 - 45:04)
like i understand that complaint i get (45:02 - 45:07)
it i i don't think them saying you can (45:04 - 45:08)
move 10 chinese a week (45:07 - 45:10)
makes that better i think they would i (45:08 - 45:11)
think they would still have the same (45:10 - 45:12)
complaint of (45:11 - 45:14)
well instead of taking eight months it's (45:12 - 45:17)
gonna take me five months i'm still mad (45:14 - 45:19)
but i think i mean i think part of the (45:17 - 45:20)
thing is that (45:19 - 45:23)
the costs are hidden and the one cost (45:20 - 45:24)
that (45:23 - 45:27)
isn't hidden is outrageous the the (45:24 - 45:27)
briefly (45:27 - 45:31)
the transporter how much can i pay (45:27 - 45:34)
to throw more energy into my transporter (45:31 - 45:35)
ten (45:34 - 45:38)
bucks ten dollars ten for ten thousand (45:35 - 45:40)
ten for ten thousand well ten well it (45:38 - 45:42)
depends so if your transporter is (45:40 - 45:43)
halfway full (45:42 - 45:46)
you pay five so it is you pay five but (45:43 - 45:48)
if it's completely empty (45:46 - 45:50)
you pay 10. i i can see them offering (45:48 - 45:51)
discounts (45:50 - 45:53)
and uh when i have my subscription i (45:51 - 45:55)
will actually get double transporter (45:53 - 45:58)
energy per month or something like that (45:55 - 46:00)
this is my opinion on the transporter i (45:58 - 46:03)
think they set it so high (46:00 - 46:06)
so no one pays it i don't think i mean (46:03 - 46:07)
that's not true (46:06 - 46:09)
people will pay it people will pay it (46:07 - 46:12)
but but if they wanted to maximize (46:09 - 46:13)
revenue (46:12 - 46:15)
i don't think ten dollars is it i think (46:13 - 46:17)
that if they would have said it at two (46:15 - 46:20)
or three dollars they would have made (46:17 - 46:21)
more money (46:20 - 46:25)
because people are more likely to go (46:21 - 46:26)
it's the same instance of if you were (46:25 - 46:28)
doing raids with a friend (46:26 - 46:30)
and you ran out of raid passes i've done (46:28 - 46:32)
this to greg a million times (46:30 - 46:36)
and i go for it and i go come on greg (46:32 - 46:37)
it's only a dollar this is our last rate (46:36 - 46:38)
of the night just (46:37 - 46:41)
just get it and then greg goes always (46:38 - 46:43)
the last six raids are always the last (46:41 - 46:44)
raid of the night (46:43 - 46:46)
and you go and you go yeah you're right (46:44 - 46:48)
it's only a dollar but there's a huge (46:46 - 46:49)
mindset between it's only a dollar or (46:48 - 46:51)
it's only three dollars too (46:49 - 46:54)
it's ten dollars it's ten dollars (46:51 - 46:57)
i think that the cost was strategically (46:54 - 46:58)
placed (46:57 - 47:00)
so when people go it is not i want to (46:58 - 47:02)
move my shiny darkrai (47:00 - 47:05)
that has used up my entire bar i do not (47:02 - 47:05)
want to pay (47:05 - 47:09)
ten dollars to move my shiny deoxys i (47:05 - 47:11)
will just wait six days (47:09 - 47:14)
and i think most people (47:11 - 47:17)
accept that logic of i'll just wait (47:14 - 47:19)
but if it was two or three dollars i (47:17 - 47:21)
would say more people would go (47:19 - 47:23)
well it's only two and three dollars i'm (47:21 - 47:24)
only going to do it once but it's never (47:23 - 47:25)
once (47:24 - 47:28)
right no you know how many people bobby (47:25 - 47:29)
i'm calling out bobby (47:28 - 47:32)
bobby has texted me several times of i'm (47:29 - 47:34)
never going to buy incubators again (47:32 - 47:37)
and every single event that dude buys (47:34 - 47:38)
incubators and goes (47:37 - 47:40)
well i spent 15 on incubators i didn't (47:38 - 47:41)
get any shinies (47:40 - 47:44)
like i think the cost was set high (47:41 - 47:46)
because there will be there there are (47:44 - 47:48)
definitely people out there (47:46 - 47:51)
with look i actually like the 10 (47:48 - 47:54)
cost because what the 10 cost tells me (47:51 - 47:56)
is that something i can work forward to (47:54 - 47:57)
in life (47:56 - 48:01)
when i am so comfortable in life that i (47:57 - 48:05)
can spend ten dollars to move a dark cry (48:01 - 48:07)
and it is nothing to my bank account i (48:05 - 48:09)
have more money (48:07 - 48:12)
than time then niantic has given me the (48:09 - 48:16)
the golden ladle of steve we're proud of (48:12 - 48:16)
you (48:16 - 48:19)
you've made so much money irl that you (48:16 - 48:19)
can just (48:19 - 48:21)
it's it you it doesn't even matter (48:19 - 48:23)
anymore move all (48:21 - 48:27)
your dark cry right now i will say this (48:23 - 48:30)
i i disagree with your people will just (48:27 - 48:32)
accept that logic and be fine with it (48:30 - 48:35)
i don't think they're fine with it i (48:32 - 48:37)
think they look at that prohibitive cost (48:35 - 48:40)
and say well i guess i have to wait (48:37 - 48:43)
and that dissatisfaction is a dangerous (48:40 - 48:45)
game for them to play (48:43 - 48:47)
is it dissatisfaction of people who are (48:45 - 48:49)
just impatient (48:47 - 48:53)
or is no i was i was not happy with that (48:49 - 48:55)
price and i have (48:53 - 48:56)
you're never going to pay that price (48:55 - 48:58)
there's nothing we're going to pay it (48:56 - 48:59)
yeah (48:58 - 49:02)
when i look you play pokemon go every (48:59 - 49:03)
day (49:02 - 49:05)
i when i looked at that price i went you (49:03 - 49:07)
have got to be kidding me (49:05 - 49:08)
okay even if that price was like three (49:07 - 49:10)
dollars to refresh why would you pay it (49:08 - 49:13)
you you you log into pokemon go every (49:10 - 49:14)
day is there (49:13 - 49:16)
is there some dire need where you need (49:14 - 49:17)
all 50 (49:16 - 49:19)
of your shiny squirtles in a different (49:17 - 49:21)
place that you're never going to do (49:19 - 49:23)
today coming up tomorrow yeah but that (49:21 - 49:24)
that that is (49:23 - 49:26)
that is the need there's the rub he's (49:24 - 49:28)
gotta dump out those boxes (49:26 - 49:31)
your laziness talking you could go (49:28 - 49:34)
through and you could clear out (49:31 - 49:38)
so many pokemon delete delete the not (49:34 - 49:40)
delete your bee dupes delete your no (49:38 - 49:41)
because you're gonna be like trade me (49:40 - 49:43)
something super old so i get it lucky (49:41 - 49:44)
because i don't have it (49:43 - 49:47)
you are part of the problem steve you're (49:44 - 49:48)
like don't get rid of that because (49:47 - 49:50)
that's from like 2016 and then you can (49:48 - 49:51)
trade it to me because (49:50 - 49:53)
i don't have that lucky yet this is what (49:51 - 49:54)
you do (49:53 - 49:56)
you enable the problem and then you yell (49:54 - 49:59)
at people for reacting to you enabling (49:56 - 50:00)
the problem (49:59 - 50:02)
i think the more important thing that (50:00 - 50:04)
the pokemon company and (50:02 - 50:09)
niantic has done here is force you (50:04 - 50:12)
force you as the player to come back to (50:09 - 50:15)
their game and i think that is more (50:12 - 50:16)
important than making (50:15 - 50:19)
money up front because (50:16 - 50:22)
pokemon go or any other mobile game (50:19 - 50:25)
wants you to log in every day and they (50:22 - 50:27)
want they want you to think about their (50:25 - 50:29)
game consistently (50:27 - 50:31)
and now this is another layer of you (50:29 - 50:33)
thinking about their game (50:31 - 50:36)
of like this uh every tuesday i get to (50:33 - 50:37)
transfer my five (50:36 - 50:41)
pokemon or my or i'm looking forward to (50:37 - 50:42)
next (50:41 - 50:44)
tuesday when i'm going to transfer my (50:42 - 50:46)
dark cry uh my shiny dark cry (50:44 - 50:49)
it it you coming back to the game i (50:46 - 50:51)
think is more important than them making (50:49 - 50:52)
ten dollars up front (50:51 - 50:55)
it's it's a risk because a week is a (50:52 - 50:56)
long (50:55 - 50:59)
time and if you aren't playing that (50:56 - 51:02)
consistently and you are really excited (50:59 - 51:04)
about moving things over every year back (51:02 - 51:05)
in the game and you hit that (51:04 - 51:08)
wall thinking oh i'll just come back in (51:05 - 51:09)
a week (51:08 - 51:13)
that's that is seven days of a person (51:09 - 51:16)
who is dissatisfied not opening their (51:13 - 51:18)
game and then trying to remember (51:16 - 51:21)
oh right if you had enough time to go to (51:18 - 51:22)
twitter to complain about the price (51:21 - 51:24)
and then in a week you forgot to log in (51:22 - 51:26)
to move your pokemon (51:24 - 51:27)
you are just the biggest baby in the (51:26 - 51:29)
world like (51:27 - 51:31)
you you are part of the problem like if (51:29 - 51:33)
this was such a big deal that you needed (51:31 - 51:36)
to tweet at niantic to be like (51:33 - 51:37)
the prices are too expensive and then (51:36 - 51:39)
two weeks pass and you go oh i haven't (51:37 - 51:40)
even logged in to go to transfer my (51:39 - 51:40)
pokemon (51:40 - 51:42)
do you actually really care or are you (51:40 - 51:43)
just complaining (51:42 - 51:46)
well it's both here's here's the thing (51:43 - 51:48)
of years in customer service (51:46 - 51:50)
that initial reaction is the true (51:48 - 51:51)
reaction (51:50 - 51:53)
when somebody is angry and they go (51:51 - 51:55)
somewhere to complain about it (51:53 - 51:58)
that is in the moment and then as they (51:55 - 52:00)
deal with those emotions and they (51:58 - 52:02)
shove that game aside so they don't have (52:00 - 52:03)
to be angry (52:02 - 52:06)
that is the end result it is all tied (52:03 - 52:07)
together (52:06 - 52:10)
in the bad customer service cycle we get (52:07 - 52:10)
it (52:10 - 52:12)
all the time i have worked in customer (52:10 - 52:15)
service for 24 years (52:12 - 52:17)
people will call you when they're angry (52:15 - 52:19)
and when you try to follow up with them (52:17 - 52:20)
they're like i don't want to think about (52:19 - 52:22)
this anymore i'm done (52:20 - 52:24)
i said what i wanted to do but when they (52:22 - 52:26)
are talking to their friends when (52:24 - 52:27)
they're talking to their family (52:26 - 52:29)
and they say well why don't you play (52:27 - 52:30)
that anymore oh it was just a cheap (52:29 - 52:32)
rip-off money grab and i just can't deal (52:30 - 52:33)
with it anymore (52:32 - 52:36)
like that negative press is not what you (52:33 - 52:37)
want (52:36 - 52:39)
and it doesn't matter if you think oh (52:37 - 52:40)
because they had time to go to twitter (52:39 - 52:42)
and complain of course it did because (52:40 - 52:43)
they're in the anger in the moment (52:42 - 52:46)
that's how bad customer service works i (52:43 - 52:48)
think if this was a money grab though (52:46 - 52:49)
they would have lowered the price (52:48 - 52:51)
they would they i guarantee they would (52:49 - 52:52)
have made more money if the price was (52:51 - 52:53)
lower because people would have been (52:52 - 52:55)
more inclined to hit that button (52:53 - 52:57)
so what you're saying is it's more in (52:55 - 52:59)
line with my philosophy (52:57 - 53:02)
of they are hardcore judging people (52:59 - 53:05)
who wasted their lives to get hundreds (53:02 - 53:07)
of shiny legendaries (53:05 - 53:10)
when they could have been out there (53:07 - 53:12)
living in the world (53:10 - 53:14)
i don't i don't think anything is wasted (53:12 - 53:16)
like if you are doing something with (53:14 - 53:18)
those pokemon they will stay (53:16 - 53:21)
in go like i have no reason to move my (53:18 - 53:23)
shiny darkrai (53:21 - 53:26)
from go to home because it is my main (53:23 - 53:29)
dark attacker that i use in psychic (53:26 - 53:29)
raids (53:29 - 53:32)
like against chris celia so that pokemon (53:29 - 53:33)
that i use (53:32 - 53:36)
every psychic raid or a lot this past (53:33 - 53:39)
month because of ghost raids too (53:36 - 53:41)
like that pokemon that i am consistently (53:39 - 53:43)
using every day is not going anywhere (53:41 - 53:45)
the poke the other two darkrai that i (53:43 - 53:47)
have never touched (53:45 - 53:48)
that have been sitting there for a year (53:47 - 53:50)
plus because shiny darkrai was first (53:48 - 53:52)
available like a year ago (53:50 - 53:54)
like yes i will eventually move those (53:52 - 53:55)
darkrai over but they will go from (53:54 - 53:57)
not being touched and collecting dust (53:55 - 53:58)
and go (53:57 - 54:01)
to not being touched and collecting dust (53:58 - 54:02)
in (54:01 - 54:05)
home like it's it's the uh (54:02 - 54:08)
real life analogy of like well uh i (54:05 - 54:09)
guess we gotta move our christmas (54:08 - 54:11)
decorations from the basement to the (54:09 - 54:12)
attic (54:11 - 54:14)
like yup you're gonna move your shiny (54:12 - 54:15)
squirtles from the basement that is (54:14 - 54:17)
pokemon go to the attic that is pokemon (54:15 - 54:18)
home (54:17 - 54:20)
and they're not going like it's not (54:18 - 54:22)
super vital (54:20 - 54:25)
to move those over if you were like uh i (54:22 - 54:27)
only got a shiny huntail in pokemon go (54:25 - 54:28)
and (54:27 - 54:30)
i need to use this i want to flex this (54:28 - 54:32)
shiny huntail in a tournament coming up (54:30 - 54:34)
next week (54:32 - 54:35)
yeah you would just move it over then (54:34 - 54:37)
and do that but (54:35 - 54:39)
but like this like need of i need to (54:37 - 54:41)
dump 500 shinies (54:39 - 54:44)
like today it is not (54:41 - 54:48)
in my opinion that dire of a need (54:44 - 54:52)
nor do i think niantic nor the pokemon (54:48 - 54:54)
company wants you to do that because (54:52 - 54:57)
if you were to dump all your pokemon all (54:54 - 54:57)
your (54:57 - 55:02)
rare pokemon at once you may be more (54:57 - 55:05)
you may be less inclined to come back to (55:02 - 55:06)
the game (55:05 - 55:09)
because now you've you've like that is (55:06 - 55:10)
the attachment that you have i don't (55:09 - 55:12)
know what the word is for that is (55:10 - 55:14)
so there you go that is i think the (55:12 - 55:16)
clearest explanation of your point right (55:14 - 55:16)
there (55:16 - 55:18)
is that if people dump all of their (55:16 - 55:20)
pokemon out of pokemon go they're not (55:18 - 55:22)
going to come into pokemon go anymore so (55:20 - 55:24)
put up a high barrier to keep people (55:22 - 55:25)
from doing that correct (55:24 - 55:28)
it's like when i when i played it's like (55:25 - 55:32)
when i played fallout 3 every single day (55:28 - 55:33)
back gosh when did that come out i (55:32 - 55:35)
played fallout 3 every single day when (55:33 - 55:36)
it came out (55:35 - 55:38)
loved it put hours into it like five (55:36 - 55:39)
hours a night for like (55:38 - 55:42)
five months and then uh my roommate (55:39 - 55:44)
saved over my game and i lost everything (55:42 - 55:47)
and i just from a from a game that i (55:44 - 55:49)
played every day and that i loved i just (55:47 - 55:49)
had (55:49 - 55:52)
no desire to start over to go back (55:49 - 55:52)
because i (55:52 - 55:55)
that that separation broke and i think (55:52 - 55:56)
that that is (55:55 - 55:59)
ultimately why this slow drip is in (55:56 - 56:00)
effect because (55:59 - 56:02)
if you were to take everything that you (56:00 - 56:04)
cherished in go and you were able to (56:02 - 56:04)
move it (56:04 - 56:06)
instantly and we already know that's not (56:04 - 56:08)
normal pokemon no one is cherishing (56:06 - 56:10)
their 40 badoofs they caught last week (56:08 - 56:12)
they they cherish those shinies they (56:10 - 56:14)
cherish those legendaries if (56:12 - 56:15)
you move them to one place you break (56:14 - 56:17)
that separation with go and you might (56:15 - 56:18)
not log in to go (56:17 - 56:19)
that's why i don't think that ten (56:18 - 56:22)
dollars is the thing that (56:19 - 56:24)
matters i think i think that if they (56:22 - 56:25)
wanted to make money they would (56:24 - 56:27)
reduce it up front because people would (56:25 - 56:28)
be more willing to pay it i think the (56:27 - 56:30)
ten dollars is (56:28 - 56:32)
boy that price sucks i'll just wait a (56:30 - 56:34)
week and then you do that every week and (56:32 - 56:34)
now (56:34 - 56:36)
you have something to look forward to (56:34 - 56:38)
you're logging in you're reading the (56:36 - 56:38)
news (56:38 - 56:40)
you're seeing what events are going in (56:38 - 56:42)
you're watching the spawns change (56:40 - 56:45)
i think that is that is from a business (56:42 - 56:47)
perspective the smartest thing they (56:45 - 56:48)
could have done (56:47 - 56:50)
i i don't think that it's the smartest (56:48 - 56:51)
thing they could have (56:50 - 56:54)
well i think in customer retention like (56:51 - 56:57)
you are you are you are banking that (56:54 - 56:59)
more people will be fine (56:57 - 57:02)
waiting than aren't and more people will (56:59 - 57:04)
be fine waiting (57:02 - 57:07)
on the people who aren't happy burning (57:04 - 57:09)
out and not (57:07 - 57:13)
trashing your game or your company (57:09 - 57:16)
those are two big risks and especially (57:13 - 57:18)
now since everybody's tech at home and (57:16 - 57:19)
they have nothing else to do those are (57:18 - 57:21)
two really big risks (57:19 - 57:23)
of we're gonna launch something and (57:21 - 57:24)
people (57:23 - 57:27)
aren't going to be happy about it and (57:24 - 57:28)
the people who aren't happy about it (57:27 - 57:31)
are way louder than the people who are (57:28 - 57:32)
that is (57:31 - 57:35)
just the fact of business and i it is (57:32 - 57:38)
it is an absolute risk it is a it is a (57:35 - 57:39)
bigger risk than i think you're (57:38 - 57:40)
downplaying (57:39 - 57:42)
i think i think though they know the (57:40 - 57:43)
back end of the risk they (57:42 - 57:46)
know how many people used bank they know (57:43 - 57:48)
how many people used bank to home they (57:46 - 57:50)
know how many people connected go (57:48 - 57:53)
to let's go so i think on their end (57:50 - 57:55)
we we will never see those numbers we'll (57:53 - 57:58)
never know but they i can't imagine that (57:55 - 58:01)
they were like well fifty this is the (57:58 - 58:02)
same company that accidentally leaned on (58:01 - 58:04)
a button and turned off shinies (58:02 - 58:08)
hey i know i i actually i (58:04 - 58:11)
i side with steve on this i think for (58:08 - 58:12)
the people (58:11 - 58:15)
who have already what do we got four (58:12 - 58:16)
years in now (58:15 - 58:18)
is that how long we've been in this who (58:16 - 58:20)
have made that much of an investment (58:18 - 58:24)
into their pokemon go collection that (58:20 - 58:27)
it's it's gonna take much more than this (58:24 - 58:29)
for them to walk away from pokemon go (58:27 - 58:32)
they will definitely complain i mean (58:29 - 58:34)
they will complain but they will (58:32 - 58:35)
continue playing because it's like i (58:34 - 58:36)
have already put (58:35 - 58:39)
so much time into this game yeah it's (58:36 - 58:40)
it's (58:39 - 58:42)
i mean if there weren't other (58:40 - 58:44)
questionable decisions leading up to (58:42 - 58:44)
this one (58:44 - 58:47)
i would be much more on the point but (58:44 - 58:48)
they've already done (58:47 - 58:50)
a number of things that are very cash (58:48 - 58:52)
grabby they've reduced (58:50 - 58:56)
bonuses for being stuck at your home for (58:52 - 58:57)
no good reason (58:56 - 58:59)
like they have built up a lot of (58:57 - 59:00)
negativity already (58:59 - 59:04)
so this isn't coming into a we all love (59:00 - 59:04)
this (59:04 - 59:06)
game where we're all neutral with this (59:04 - 59:08)
game they're walking into a somewhat (59:06 - 59:10)
hostile environment and dropping a big (59:08 - 59:11)
bomb (59:10 - 59:13)
and the fact that they hide those (59:11 - 59:15)
numbers the fact that they aren't (59:13 - 59:17)
upfront and transparent with how much (59:15 - 59:19)
you can and can't transfer (59:17 - 59:22)
adds to that frustration and i think (59:19 - 59:24)
it's a very dangerous game that they (59:22 - 59:25)
already have a bunch of people (59:24 - 59:27)
frustrated with (59:25 - 59:30)
raid pass grabs incubator grabs (59:27 - 59:32)
all of these things and then have this (59:30 - 59:34)
be another barrier (59:32 - 59:37)
it it adds to that frustration and i (59:34 - 59:38)
think that's (59:37 - 59:41)
much harder for them to quantify like (59:38 - 59:42)
they know how many people (59:41 - 59:45)
connected to x y z but that doesn't (59:42 - 59:48)
that was at a different point in time (59:45 - 59:48)
than where we (59:48 - 59:50)
are now and there's a huge risk now (59:48 - 59:52)
because they've angered a lot of people (59:50 - 59:55)
about a lot of things in a short amount (59:52 - 59:56)
of time recently (59:55 - 59:58)
but i think right now they probably they (59:56 - 60:00)
probably know that people are mad and (59:58 - 60:00)
they (60:00 - 60:02)
probably don't want people dumping all (60:00 - 60:03)
their pokemon because that will separate (60:02 - 60:04)
them from the game (60:03 - 60:07)
and they want people to keep logging in (60:04 - 60:07)
it's (60:07 - 60:10)
yeah they may i i stick by the fact that (60:07 - 60:10)
they are (60:10 - 60:13)
playing a very risky game they'll never (60:10 - 60:15)
tell us what happens right (60:13 - 60:18)
but yeah i i think they are (60:15 - 60:22)
really taking risks with their good name (60:18 - 60:25)
that don't need to be taken i i still (60:22 - 60:26)
think though if they allowed (60:25 - 60:28)
10 shiny pokemon a week instead of five (60:26 - 60:30)
i still think we would have the same (60:28 - 60:31)
reaction (60:30 - 60:33)
i agree i think if they were transparent (60:31 - 60:34)
with the costs (60:33 - 60:38)
and they were very transparent with (60:34 - 60:40)
or they lowered the price to refill we (60:38 - 60:41)
would have a very different (60:40 - 60:44)
conversation but the fact that they a (60:41 - 60:46)
made it hard to find (60:44 - 60:48)
b were terrible at communicating it c (60:46 - 60:50)
you have to go to third parties (60:48 - 60:53)
to find the costs and then if you did (60:50 - 60:54)
that and didn't understand the refresh (60:53 - 60:55)
rate or anything (60:54 - 60:57)
and you saw oh it's going to take (60:55 - 60:59)
another week for this to refill up or i (60:57 - 61:00)
have to pay ten dollars (60:59 - 61:03)
like that's bad bad bad bad bad bad bad (61:00 - 61:06)
yeah like that's a bad experience all (61:03 - 61:07)
the way down because they just (61:06 - 61:11)
refuse to be transparent and that (61:07 - 61:13)
hurts them as a company that anytime i (61:11 - 61:14)
don't think that's nice (61:13 - 61:15)
though i think that's the pokemon (61:14 - 61:18)
company yeah but niantic's going to take (61:15 - 61:19)
the brunt of that (61:18 - 61:23)
oh yeah yeah yeah which is bad (61:19 - 61:26)
i mean that's just a bad deal to be in (61:23 - 61:27)
yeah the pokemon company hates assigning (61:26 - 61:30)
numbers to their pokemon that aren't (61:27 - 61:32)
like level h and like level and hp (61:30 - 61:36)
values like they don't want us to know (61:32 - 61:38)
that it's one in 25 on community days (61:36 - 61:40)
even though we all know it's what it (61:38 - 61:40)
talks (61:40 - 61:44)
about it's so in the year (61:40 - 61:47)
that we live in in in the world that we (61:44 - 61:48)
live in and the people that do this (61:47 - 61:49)
research (61:48 - 61:52)
just stubbornly be like no no (61:49 - 61:54)
we're just you know even though (61:52 - 61:57)
everybody can figure it out no it's like (61:54 - 62:00)
it's like i do one of the things that (61:57 - 62:01)
drives me crazy with people who (62:00 - 62:03)
run role-playing games like we've all (62:01 - 62:04)
figured out (62:03 - 62:07)
what number we have to hit to be able to (62:04 - 62:08)
hit the monster (62:07 - 62:11)
stop being coy about it we all figured (62:08 - 62:11)
it out (62:11 - 62:14)
five minutes ago you can just tell us it (62:11 - 62:16)
doesn't change the game (62:14 - 62:19)
it just makes it faster so greg you see (62:16 - 62:21)
secretly come out as a game gobbler i (62:19 - 62:23)
see how it is (62:21 - 62:25)
i'm not a game goer like i'm one of the (62:23 - 62:26)
people that looked at well i'm not (62:25 - 62:27)
paying that (62:26 - 62:29)
and since i already play it every day (62:27 - 62:31)
it's like whatever i'll move it (62:29 - 62:33)
i just moved enough that i had space on (62:31 - 62:35)
community day if i do it (62:33 - 62:38)
my apathy for the game keeps me from (62:35 - 62:40)
being angry at the game because i (62:38 - 62:41)
honestly (62:40 - 62:43)
like been like oh yeah i should log into (62:41 - 62:45)
that today and do some stuff (62:43 - 62:49)
but if i don't i don't you know i'm not (62:45 - 62:51)
super invested in pokemon go one way or (62:49 - 62:52)
the other (62:51 - 62:55)
i do it to be able to play with like (62:52 - 62:56)
community days with you (62:55 - 62:58)
and i'll do it to keep up with certain (62:56 - 63:00)
things like oh i should just log in (62:58 - 63:01)
today because (63:00 - 63:04)
i'm sitting on lunch and it's just there (63:01 - 63:04)
but (63:04 - 63:07)
i am not invested in the game anymore (63:04 - 63:08)
that ended a (63:07 - 63:11)
very long time yeah i mean i'm still (63:08 - 63:15)
like happy with go as it turns out like (63:11 - 63:16)
i still like go (63:15 - 63:20)
um and as as as i do agree that i i kind (63:16 - 63:22)
of wish i could move over (63:20 - 63:25)
more of the pokemon that are rare to me (63:22 - 63:27)
like deoxys like i can only move what (63:25 - 63:29)
like five dioxis a week i think i (63:27 - 63:30)
calculated on stream (63:29 - 63:32)
and i would have like just a tiny little (63:30 - 63:35)
bit left it would take me (63:32 - 63:37)
months because i i think i have like 81 (63:35 - 63:38)
deoxys (63:37 - 63:41)
because i never threw away a deoxys (63:38 - 63:45)
um so 5 times what (63:41 - 63:48)
10 12 like like over 10 weeks (63:45 - 63:52)
to move 80 some deoxys over (63:48 - 63:54)
like no one needs add accesses but the (63:52 - 63:55)
reason the (63:54 - 63:57)
the reason i never have thrown away a (63:55 - 63:59)
legendary (63:57 - 64:02)
ever or a mythical ever (63:59 - 64:05)
or a shiny is because even though i now (64:02 - 64:07)
have 30 shiny squirtles or i have 81 (64:05 - 64:08)
deoxyses (64:07 - 64:12)
not everyone has a deoxys (64:08 - 64:15)
like deoxys or what it's worth is still (64:12 - 64:16)
pretty rare like yeah you could have (64:15 - 64:18)
bought omega ruby alpha sapphire gone (64:16 - 64:20)
through it got the dx at the end but not (64:18 - 64:21)
everyone played that game (64:20 - 64:23)
not everyone had forty dollars so for me (64:21 - 64:25)
the value was (64:23 - 64:27)
i want all of these mythicals i want all (64:25 - 64:28)
these legendaries that i (64:27 - 64:30)
eventually i'm for the most part paid (64:28 - 64:32)
money for uh whether it was a free raid (64:30 - 64:33)
pass or a dollar raid pass or a (64:32 - 64:36)
dollar fifty remote raid pass and now (64:33 - 64:37)
that i (64:36 - 64:39)
will be able to move these deoxes over (64:37 - 64:40)
eventually (64:39 - 64:42)
um i can trade them to people and i (64:40 - 64:44)
could be like here is like i'd trade me (64:42 - 64:46)
a pidgey i don't care here's a deoxys (64:44 - 64:47)
for you (64:46 - 64:51)
so like like that that is exciting to me (64:47 - 64:53)
like the same way uh like getting (64:51 - 64:54)
christmas presents (64:53 - 64:55)
for people is like i don't care about (64:54 - 64:57)
receiving christmas presents but i like (64:55 - 64:59)
giving christmas presents so (64:57 - 65:01)
like yeah even though i can't move all (64:59 - 65:03)
add accesses over this weekend (65:01 - 65:06)
i'm also probably not finding 80 people (65:03 - 65:08)
in a single weekend to be like here's a (65:06 - 65:09)
deoxis (65:08 - 65:11)
actually i probably could find 80 people (65:09 - 65:12)
on my twitch i mean (65:11 - 65:17)
yes but like yeah i'm not in a rush (65:12 - 65:20)
but i i also think that like this will (65:17 - 65:21)
change in the future they will make it (65:20 - 65:23)
so you will be able to move more pokemon (65:21 - 65:24)
in the future (65:23 - 65:26)
future they're just drip feeding it and (65:24 - 65:28)
i i do agree that (65:26 - 65:31)
it can it has we've seen it cause (65:28 - 65:33)
frustration with people (65:31 - 65:35)
because they wanted to dump their (65:33 - 65:37)
pokemon and now they have to (65:35 - 65:40)
set an alarm every wednesday to be like (65:37 - 65:41)
okay this is the day i move (65:40 - 65:43)
another five shiny squirtles i mean (65:41 - 65:45)
people get resentful of an (65:43 - 65:47)
outside thing that tells them how they (65:45 - 65:49)
have to interact with thick thing (65:47 - 65:53)
like that is just that is always a that (65:49 - 65:54)
is always a resentmaker (65:53 - 65:57)
i eventually resented animal crossing (65:54 - 65:59)
again for making me have to be there (65:57 - 66:01)
every day (65:59 - 66:03)
like there is a resent that builds up (66:01 - 66:04)
when something (66:03 - 66:07)
that is supposed to be fun demands you (66:04 - 66:10)
to come on their schedule all right well (66:07 - 66:11)
that's been talked to (66:10 - 66:14)
talk to forever (66:11 - 66:17)
on the flip side the rest of the news we (66:14 - 66:18)
have is (66:17 - 66:20)
not that controversial controversial (66:18 - 66:21)
that's what you think (66:20 - 66:23)
that's what you think we wait till we (66:21 - 66:25)
talk about the pokemon center arriving (66:23 - 66:28)
to canada and how we should shut it down (66:25 - 66:28)
okay we'll take a quick break and when (66:29 - 66:32)
we come back we have zeroed (66:30 - 66:34)
canada and some pokemon master stuff we (66:32 - 66:37)

we have a little bit of masters news (67:22 - 67:25)
they introduced two new characters (67:23 - 67:28)
so figured we cover them first one was (67:25 - 67:29)
an (67:28 - 67:32)
oh actually this article covers both of (67:29 - 67:32)
them (67:32 - 67:36)
uh the softpokemon.com nate and braver (67:32 - 67:40)
braviary and bianca and musharna (67:36 - 67:42)
and time trials come to pokemon masters (67:40 - 67:43)
ex (67:42 - 67:45)
there is a flurry of activity happening (67:43 - 67:47)
in masters ex i don't know about flurry (67:45 - 67:47)
but (67:47 - 67:50)
okay there's activity happening in (67:47 - 67:51)
master cx (67:50 - 67:53)
a full disclosure i am partnered with (67:51 - 67:55)
dna kicking off two new trainers of (67:53 - 67:56)
unova region from (67:55 - 67:58)
november 11th through the 29th the (67:56 - 68:00)
flying type sink pair (67:58 - 68:02)
nate and braviary and the psychic type (68:00 - 68:05)
sink pair bianca and musharna (68:02 - 68:07)
will be available both five star sync (68:05 - 68:08)
pairs can be (68:07 - 68:12)
raised to sync 6 star ex from november (68:08 - 68:12)
15th (68:12 - 68:15)
to the 29th you will also have a chance (68:12 - 68:16)
to scout (68:15 - 68:18)
two new sink pairs that appea that (68:16 - 68:20)
appeared briefly (68:18 - 68:22)
last year's holiday season rosa and (68:20 - 68:24)
delhi bird and cybold are (68:22 - 68:27)
an artillery both five-star sink pairs (68:24 - 68:28)
this year rosa (68:27 - 68:32)
can be raised to six star ex (68:28 - 68:34)
new and recurring sink pairs could serve (68:32 - 68:36)
you well in the new time trial event (68:34 - 68:38)
which challenges you to win battles in (68:36 - 68:40)
the shortest possible time the faster (68:38 - 68:42)
you complete the more points you earn (68:40 - 68:44)
you can exchange your points for a (68:42 - 68:45)
variety of rewards (68:44 - 68:48)
you may need to rethink your strategy to (68:45 - 68:49)
get the shortest (68:48 - 68:52)
time that's it that's pretty much it (68:49 - 68:54)
uh i think it's kind of a little early (68:52 - 68:55)
for rose and deliberate but i (68:54 - 68:58)
i guess sure i mean start start (68:55 - 69:00)
christmas now (68:58 - 69:01)
uh my assumption is there's gonna be a (69:00 - 69:03)
new christmas pair that's why they're (69:01 - 69:05)
doing these from the 15th to the 29th (69:03 - 69:07)
i could see that deliberate could also (69:05 - 69:09)
be thanksgiving (69:07 - 69:12)
i mean yeah if you cook them sure that (69:09 - 69:13)
was my intent (69:12 - 69:15)
there's no surprise with bianca and (69:13 - 69:17)
musharna here i think that was (69:15 - 69:20)
very obvious uh bravery and (69:17 - 69:24)
nate that seems fine sure (69:20 - 69:27)
i protest but whatever that seems all (69:24 - 69:28)
right i guess i can't remember what else (69:27 - 69:29)
like (69:28 - 69:32)
nate uses because you're nate (69:29 - 69:33)
technically (69:32 - 69:37)
right yep nate is any good (69:33 - 69:41)
i don't know i haven't heard any (69:37 - 69:43)
either of those two pairs as being great (69:41 - 69:44)
like i've not heard (69:43 - 69:46)
anybody saying oh really pull this this (69:44 - 69:48)
is like (69:46 - 69:50)
they're super good like alder was (69:48 - 69:52)
supposed to be really good which i never (69:50 - 69:53)
got (69:52 - 69:54)
oh they're still going though right they (69:53 - 69:56)
didn't pull them yet yeah (69:54 - 69:58)
yeah well i guess i was going to pull (69:56 - 70:00)
for alder and (69:58 - 70:02)
nate but i guess i'm gonna pull for rosa (70:00 - 70:03)
and (70:02 - 70:05)
cybold because they're limited and like (70:03 - 70:07)
nate and (70:05 - 70:10)
bianca and alder or not they just go (70:07 - 70:11)
back (70:10 - 70:14)
into the pool afterwards the pool the (70:11 - 70:17)
pool of ever growing characters (70:14 - 70:19)
yeah do we know what bianca is supposed (70:17 - 70:21)
to do (70:19 - 70:24)
uh i do not look into that now she just (70:21 - 70:27)
exists as far as i'm concerned (70:24 - 70:30)
i treat bianca the same in every game (70:27 - 70:32)
she just exists (70:30 - 70:37)
[Music] (70:32 - 70:37)
it's funny because it's true this is uh (70:37 - 70:40)
off (70:40 - 70:42)

in japan they can't figure out how to (71:23 - 71:26)
spell it is some some (71:25 - 71:29)
of their promotional material is c-o-c-o (71:26 - 71:30)
some is k-o-k-o (71:29 - 71:32)
maybe america thought let's just not (71:30 - 71:34)
deal with this and let's just (71:32 - 71:37)
rename it two secrets of the journey the (71:34 - 71:38)
newest animated film (71:37 - 71:41)
of the beloved pokemon franchise pokemon (71:38 - 71:42)
the movie secrets of the jungle will be (71:41 - 71:44)
coming to fans (71:42 - 71:47)
in the world in 2021 this will actually (71:44 - 71:49)
come in japan on christmas day (71:47 - 71:51)
trainers can watch the official trailer (71:49 - 71:52)
here it is just the japanese trailer (71:51 - 71:53)
with (71:52 - 71:56)
english voices the 23 third animated (71:53 - 71:57)
film (71:56 - 71:59)
tells the story of coco now the english (71:57 - 72:02)
release is spelling it koko (71:59 - 72:05)
a young boy raised by pokemon and the (72:02 - 72:06)
creation of a (72:05 - 72:09)
new bond between humans and pokemon deep (72:06 - 72:10)
in the jungle far from any human (72:09 - 72:12)
settlement in the forest of (72:10 - 72:15)
okoya a pokemon paradise forbidden to (72:12 - 72:17)
outsiders protected by a secret code of (72:15 - 72:18)
rules (72:17 - 72:21)
in this jungle lives coco a human boy (72:18 - 72:23)
who has been raised by the mythical (72:21 - 72:24)
pokemon zarud (72:23 - 72:27)
koko has grown up never doubting that he (72:24 - 72:30)
is a pokemon but one day a chance (72:27 - 72:33)
meeting ash and pikachu leaves coco with (72:30 - 72:35)
his first human friend (72:33 - 72:38)
is he truly a pokemon question mark or (72:35 - 72:41)
is he in fact a human (72:38 - 72:44)
question mark if you're lucky trainers (72:41 - 72:45)
you may too (72:44 - 72:48)
find the threats of the forest of okoya (72:45 - 72:49)
and the bonds between (72:48 - 72:52)
pokemon and human as well as the love (72:49 - 72:53)
between a parent (72:52 - 72:56)
and a child will be put to the test (72:53 - 72:59)
is this gonna be like zaru doesn't trust (72:56 - 73:03)
humans no pokemon trust humans (72:59 - 73:06)
absolutely also uh coco is a ditto (73:03 - 73:10)
yeah you think coco is a ditto i'm sure (73:06 - 73:12)
you're throwing that out there right now (73:10 - 73:16)
what if he's a zoro he's a zarara (73:12 - 73:18)
i mean do you think they had to spell (73:16 - 73:20)
coco with a k because coco with the c is (73:18 - 73:22)
already a movie and another property (73:20 - 73:24)
yeah i thought they would spell it with (73:22 - 73:26)
a c because they didn't want to have (73:24 - 73:27)
confusion of tapu coco (73:26 - 73:30)
but yeah then they falls into the other (73:27 - 73:31)
coco (73:30 - 73:34)
movies with the very litigious other (73:31 - 73:36)
company that owns that movie (73:34 - 73:38)
this is the one where like there is a (73:36 - 73:40)
coco card coming (73:38 - 73:43)
and it is technically the boy so maybe (73:40 - 73:45)
the boy maybe the boy is celebi no that (73:43 - 73:46)
doesn't make sense because (73:45 - 73:49)
celebi is no celebrity celebrity is made (73:46 - 73:50)
only a celebrity (73:49 - 73:54)
coke maybe he's immune you can transform (73:50 - 73:59)
oh ditto zarua zorak that's for pokemon (73:54 - 74:02)
i don't know do we think that coco will (73:59 - 74:03)
be able to (74:02 - 74:06)
speak to ash having never been around (74:03 - 74:07)
humans (74:06 - 74:10)
oh yeah the power of pokemon gives you (74:07 - 74:12)
anything (74:10 - 74:12)
yeah i i mean i'm assuming there's time (74:13 - 74:16)
travel in the movie that's why celebi is (74:15 - 74:17)
there (74:16 - 74:19)
that's right celebi is in the movie (74:17 - 74:21)
don't forget so maybe (74:19 - 74:24)
he is a boy but at the end they time (74:21 - 74:26)
travel back so we all forget (74:24 - 74:28)
that they are releasing a tcg card of a (74:26 - 74:30)
human (74:28 - 74:33)
maybe that's the goal um does this movie (74:30 - 74:35)
sound good or does it already sound like (74:33 - 74:36)
a hot mess (74:35 - 74:39)
uh it sounds look they can't go (74:36 - 74:41)
worse than the power of us right no they (74:39 - 74:43)
can't (74:41 - 74:45)
valid so is this in the power of us (74:43 - 74:47)
universe or is this in the other (74:45 - 74:50)
universe i think this is in the universe (74:47 - 74:52)
that split with i choose you (74:50 - 74:54)
which is just because it's just ash (74:52 - 74:55)
because all of those movies have just (74:54 - 74:57)
been ash (74:55 - 75:00)
ash and pikachu so the assumption is ash (74:57 - 75:01)
doesn't use any of his pokemon besides (75:00 - 75:03)
pikachu so we never know what he has (75:01 - 75:07)
his uh rival his companions are not with (75:03 - 75:08)
him (75:07 - 75:10)
like they were you think coco can be (75:08 - 75:12)
caught in a master ball (75:10 - 75:13)
well who would waste their master ball (75:12 - 75:15)
on a human (75:13 - 75:18)
it's the rarest no it's the most (75:15 - 75:21)
dangerous game (75:18 - 75:21)
and chase it down cannot possibly be bad (75:23 - 75:29)
because there's a cramer ant in it well (75:26 - 75:32)
there you go there's no way this is this (75:29 - 75:33)
is the (75:32 - 75:35)
munchlax and the hot dog machine (75:33 - 75:36)
argument again (75:35 - 75:38)
that was a good movie definitely it (75:36 - 75:40)
definitely could be bad (75:38 - 75:42)
in everything around that one moment no (75:40 - 75:44)
no no no no there was nothing (75:42 - 75:46)
there was no good pokemon in the power (75:44 - 75:48)
of us what were you gonna say bonsai is (75:46 - 75:48)
fun (75:48 - 75:51)
no one can no why would i in what (75:48 - 75:52)
universe (75:51 - 75:54)
am i defending power of us right but (75:52 - 75:56)
that's why the power of us is bad that's (75:54 - 75:56)
what i'm saying (75:56 - 75:58)
the the power of us was bad because of (75:56 - 76:01)
the pokemon choices in the movie (75:58 - 76:03)
oh it was bad for more than the pokemon (76:01 - 76:06)
choices but the pokemon choices set it (76:03 - 76:07)
up to be bad (76:06 - 76:10)
they didn't help if if you're a director (76:07 - 76:10)
and (76:10 - 76:14)
you've already picked bad pokemon you (76:10 - 76:14)
have (76:14 - 76:17)
already made bad choices beyond the (76:14 - 76:19)
script (76:17 - 76:21)
that's what i'm saying this person (76:19 - 76:23)
picked crammer aunt to be in the movie (76:21 - 76:25)
he can't possibly he or she (76:23 - 76:27)
cannot possibly write a bad movie if (76:25 - 76:29)
they have good taste in pokemon (76:27 - 76:32)
that is the logic that i am applying (76:29 - 76:32)
here (76:32 - 76:34)
that is the bad logic you're applying (76:32 - 76:35)
there (76:34 - 76:38)
you're assuming that they're that (76:35 - 76:39)
they're the same person that's making (76:38 - 76:41)
those choices (76:39 - 76:43)
we know that many people work on these (76:41 - 76:44)
films yeah (76:43 - 76:46)
yeah that's true that's true what (76:44 - 76:47)
pokemon were even (76:46 - 76:50)
in power of us there's one that doesn't (76:47 - 76:50)
aurora (76:50 - 76:53)
[Laughter] (76:50 - 76:55)
not yeah well i mean yeah lugia for (76:53 - 76:56)
about 45. (76:55 - 76:59)
not even 45 seconds lugia was like maybe (76:56 - 77:01)
15 seconds (76:59 - 77:02)
sarah aura didn't even get more than (77:01 - 77:04)
like five minutes of (77:02 - 77:07)
screen time and they didn't (77:04 - 77:11)
still the thing that boggles my mind (77:07 - 77:15)
is zera aura is just getting wrecked (77:11 - 77:19)
and ash is like no it wants it this way (77:15 - 77:22)
i'm like i'm pretty sure it doesn't (77:19 - 77:24)
i'm pretty sure it's getting wrecked it (77:22 - 77:27)
would like some support kid (77:24 - 77:29)
gosh that movie was bad okay more to (77:27 - 77:30)
this press release (77:29 - 77:33)
the new tcg sword and shield vivid (77:30 - 77:34)
voltage has been released (77:33 - 77:37)
zarud makes its debut how did we not (77:34 - 77:38)
figure this out why (77:37 - 77:41)
why is everyone dumb everyone looks like (77:38 - 77:43)
like remember when they showed the one (77:41 - 77:44)
trailer (77:43 - 77:47)
back when the isle of armor came out and (77:44 - 77:49)
then the the the (77:47 - 77:51)
the ceo of the pokemon company the rich (77:49 - 77:53)
guy who no one ever complains at because (77:51 - 77:55)
they would rather complain to masuda (77:53 - 77:55)
instead (77:55 - 77:57)
the guy who runs the pokemon company (77:55 - 77:59)
ishihara (77:57 - 78:00)
he's sitting there and he's sitting (77:59 - 78:02)
there in front of like (78:00 - 78:06)
uh like a an umbreon and a espeon plush (78:02 - 78:06)
and he has like (78:06 - 78:08)
the the nintendo switch in the (78:06 - 78:10)
background with evie and pikachu on it (78:08 - 78:14)
and people are like let's go johto is (78:10 - 78:16)
coming look at the sign is on the wall (78:14 - 78:19)
how did we not like but no one goes hey (78:16 - 78:21)
the root is coming out in vivid voltage (78:19 - 78:23)
i bet they announced as a rude (78:21 - 78:24)
distribution when vivid voltage comes (78:23 - 78:26)
out because now they have to actually (78:24 - 78:29)
acknowledge the rude in america (78:26 - 78:31)
like yeah it like super obvious in (78:29 - 78:33)
retrospect (78:31 - 78:34)
that like because nobody cares about (78:33 - 78:36)
that i mean (78:34 - 78:39)
they want that let's go johto i guess (78:36 - 78:41)
yeah they care about that (78:39 - 78:45)
the rude is in vivid voltage as a card (78:41 - 78:48)
it is available now if you can find it (78:45 - 78:50)
there's also a new type of card called (78:48 - 78:53)
amazing pokemon amazing pokemon feature (78:50 - 78:55)
legendary or mythical pokemon (78:53 - 78:57)
illustrated with vividly rainbow (78:55 - 78:58)
backgrounds that extends (78:57 - 79:01)
outside of the frame as well as foiled (78:58 - 79:02)
and etched details (79:01 - 79:04)
of a special rarity symbol when you (79:02 - 79:06)
thought (79:04 - 79:09)
that they couldn't make this is the real (79:06 - 79:10)
money grab it's not pokemon home it's (79:09 - 79:12)
not the ten dollars (79:10 - 79:15)
it's the it's this this is this hidden (79:12 - 79:16)
rarity they keep (79:15 - 79:19)
introducing in the tcg yup (79:16 - 79:20)
because first it was like oh you only (79:19 - 79:23)
had rare and then it was like okay now (79:20 - 79:25)
you have ultra rare oh now you have (79:23 - 79:25)
secret rare (79:25 - 79:27)
now we have the rainbow rare now we have (79:25 - 79:29)
these gold shiny rare (79:27 - 79:30)
now you're telling me that there's these (79:29 - 79:33)
amazing rares (79:30 - 79:35)
i can't keep up there's 180 cards on (79:33 - 79:37)
this set (79:35 - 79:40)
uh six amazing rares (79:37 - 79:43)
six v-max including pikachu v-max or (79:40 - 79:44)
beetle v-max (79:43 - 79:47)
colossal v-max shown in their gigantomax (79:44 - 79:48)
form 11 v (79:47 - 79:51)
cards plus 13 full art v (79:48 - 79:55)
cards the tcg is the ultimate scam (79:51 - 79:57)
well yeah that's why i've been i've been (79:55 - 79:59)
telling people tggs have been ultimate (79:57 - 80:00)
scam (79:59 - 80:03)
for a long time all tcgs are the (80:00 - 80:05)
ultimate scam yes (80:03 - 80:07)
yes and steve you're like if i come when (80:05 - 80:08)
i come there i'm gonna make you play (80:07 - 80:12)
pokemon tcg playing the tcg is not (80:08 - 80:16)
the same as collecting the tcg (80:12 - 80:18)
it's still a scam because the good cards (80:16 - 80:19)
people know them and then they (80:18 - 80:20)
break them out of packs and sell them (80:19 - 80:23)
for five million dollars that's true (80:20 - 80:26)
uh so scam so here is how zarood (80:23 - 80:29)
will be distributed everything the (80:26 - 80:31)
entire franchise this podcast is a scam (80:29 - 80:32)

clearly do not have reading (80:56 - 81:00)
comprehension because literally the next (80:58 - 81:01)
sentence is (81:00 - 81:03)
trainers who register this way will get (81:01 - 81:06)
the email for zarud on december (81:03 - 81:10)

if they're open or you can get go to the (82:33 - 82:36)
game (82:36 - 82:39)
online store in the near future i don't (82:36 - 82:40)
know what that means i've never been to (82:39 - 82:41)
a game (82:40 - 82:42)
but i assume it's like past (82:41 - 82:45)
distributions in ireland (82:42 - 82:49)
it will go through gamestop's website (82:45 - 82:51)
i don't know what that means gamestop at (82:49 - 82:52)
least in america has only been (82:51 - 82:54)
in store so i'm not 100 sure what that (82:52 - 82:55)
means (82:54 - 82:58)
in germany you have to go to gamestop in (82:55 - 82:59)
the store (82:58 - 83:02)
and you can do that now for our german (82:59 - 83:03)
listeners (83:02 - 83:05)
apparently it will be on gamestop online (83:03 - 83:06)
on december 1st (83:05 - 83:09)
in austria and switzerland gamestop in (83:06 - 83:11)
store now (83:09 - 83:13)
in the netherlands and belgium game (83:11 - 83:14)
mania (83:13 - 83:16)
you have to sign up on their website (83:14 - 83:19)

in france micro mania i have no clue (83:19 - 83:24)
these these game stores are out of (83:23 - 83:26)
control you have to sign up on their (83:24 - 83:28)
website to get a code (83:26 - 83:30)
and then in portugal you have to go to (83:28 - 83:34)
fnac stores no clue what that is uh (83:30 - 83:37)
no word on canada no word on australia (83:34 - 83:37)
i'm (83:37 - 83:39)
so sorry to you all (83:37 - 83:42)
[Laughter] (83:39 - 83:44)
but that's that's everything cerebe has (83:42 - 83:46)
reported thus far (83:44 - 83:49)
but to be fair i think australia didn't (83:46 - 83:50)
get zera aura (83:49 - 83:53)
until like five months after the movie (83:50 - 83:55)
stopped showing (83:53 - 83:58)
so yeah i don't know about canada canada (83:55 - 83:59)
also is (83:58 - 84:03)
sometimes delayed i think canada's can (83:59 - 84:05)
sign up for the trainers club account (84:03 - 84:08)
if i'm not mistaken so do that i guess (84:05 - 84:09)
with the hopes (84:08 - 84:12)
but canada doesn't have gamestop they (84:09 - 84:13)
have eb (84:12 - 84:16)
games so i guess probably something with (84:13 - 84:17)
eb (84:16 - 84:20)
games in the near future these codes (84:17 - 84:22)
should be universal though so just like (84:20 - 84:25)
if you bought a movie ticket in japan (84:22 - 84:28)
you get the 16 to 12 16 digit code one (84:25 - 84:29)
of those numbers (84:28 - 84:31)
yeah and you should be able to redeem (84:29 - 84:34)
them what is stopping (84:31 - 84:37)
somebody in canada or australia (84:34 - 84:39)
signing up for the trainers club (84:37 - 84:41)
newsletter (84:39 - 84:43)
i don't think it asks for your location (84:41 - 84:46)
does it i don't think so (84:43 - 84:49)
i don't remember i i've been signed up (84:46 - 84:50)
for those things for so long (84:49 - 84:52)
yeah because they send out like one free (84:50 - 84:54)
free tcg code at like a month (84:52 - 84:58)
yeah also like people who had to sign up (84:54 - 84:58)
for the last time (84:58 - 85:00)
and they were like oh i have to sign up (84:58 - 85:01)
for it again why didn't you just leave (85:00 - 85:02)
it (85:01 - 85:05)
it's not hard to delete an email yeah (85:02 - 85:06)
like you know this is how they (85:05 - 85:07)
distribute things (85:06 - 85:09)
like just stay on the list can i can i (85:07 - 85:12)
as a us person go to game mania's (85:09 - 85:14)
website in the netherlands and just sign (85:12 - 85:17)
up on their website and get a code (85:14 - 85:17)
yeah yeah sure i mean i got google (85:18 - 85:22)
translate (85:21 - 85:25)
that's how it works right no (85:22 - 85:27)
because you're gonna get like the (85:25 - 85:29)
completely wrong thing (85:27 - 85:32)
how hard is dutch i don't know i don't (85:29 - 85:33)
know anything (85:32 - 85:35)
in dutch how do they hello an extra (85:33 - 85:36)
level (85:35 - 85:40)
ola that's spanish that's spanish (85:36 - 85:43)
well the glass is oof to taffle root is (85:40 - 85:45)
out no word on the shiny celebi (85:43 - 85:47)
which i think was a concern of some (85:45 - 85:49)
people's japan got chinese celebi (85:47 - 85:50)
doesn't (85:49 - 85:52)
they could do this at a later date give (85:50 - 85:54)
the shiny celebi one maybe (85:52 - 85:57)
it's for christmas they they could give (85:54 - 85:59)
the shiny celebi (85:57 - 86:02)
when the movie actually comes out right (85:59 - 86:05)
shiny celebi isn't in vivid voltage (86:02 - 86:08)
so if they're waiting to do two of them (86:05 - 86:09)
they could just not do shiny celebi (86:08 - 86:11)
that's very true (86:09 - 86:14)
um but they but they could do and (86:11 - 86:15)
probably will do a distribution (86:14 - 86:17)
when the movie actually comes out in the (86:15 - 86:18)
united states which we don't know when (86:17 - 86:19)
that is (86:18 - 86:21)
i still strongly believe it will be (86:19 - 86:23)
exclusive to netflix (86:21 - 86:27)

stand for united states it could stand (88:01 - 88:04)

but i would argue that it probably (88:04 - 88:08)
stands for us (88:07 - 88:10)

friend (90:18 - 90:22)
this is from pat says if you could (90:19 - 90:24)
remove one feature that you dislike from (90:22 - 90:25)
main series or spin-off (90:24 - 90:29)
franchise what would you remove pay to (90:25 - 90:33)
[Laughter] (90:29 - 90:34)
win (90:33 - 90:35)
i mean steve's gonna say all the (90:34 - 90:38)
different stones dang how did you know (90:35 - 90:39)
because that's all you ever complain (90:38 - 90:41)
about there's too many (90:39 - 90:43)
they've gotten rid of so many things (90:41 - 90:45)
that i've hated already like hms and (90:43 - 90:46)
breeding was terrible (90:45 - 90:49)
i mean i want them to bring back barry (90:46 - 90:50)
planting (90:49 - 90:52)
hey they didn't say bring back they said (90:50 - 90:53)
remove (90:52 - 90:55)
i know i'm trying to think of what to (90:53 - 90:56)
get rid of (90:55 - 90:58)
well what do you will's pay to win (90:56 - 91:00)
anything else no i (90:58 - 91:03)
honestly uh i think marks (91:00 - 91:05)
[Laughter] (91:03 - 91:08)
marks and ribbons get rid of them yep no (91:05 - 91:09)
i mean ribbons whatever nobody ever (91:08 - 91:11)
cared about ribbons but it's basically (91:09 - 91:14)
like i was discussing this with texas (91:11 - 91:15)
chris (91:14 - 91:18)
everybody's named chris these days but (91:15 - 91:19)
um (91:18 - 91:22)
marks are basically there now because (91:19 - 91:25)
shinies are too available and it's like (91:22 - 91:26)
we have to have something that's (91:25 - 91:28)
exclusive to keep the (91:26 - 91:30)
obsessive people in here trying to get (91:28 - 91:31)
the fancy stuff (91:30 - 91:33)
[Laughter] (91:31 - 91:36)
and i'm like you know what it's just (91:33 - 91:37)
like (91:36 - 91:39)
every time i get there you you make it (91:37 - 91:41)
that one more level more difficult and (91:39 - 91:44)
i'm i'm not i mean you can just ignore (91:41 - 91:46)
marx (91:44 - 91:48)
like to like just ignore shinies too and (91:46 - 91:51)
yet that seems impossible to do (91:48 - 91:53)
i was going to say pokey jobs but i just (91:51 - 91:54)
ignore poke jobs (91:53 - 91:56)
yeah they're really bad they're not (91:54 - 91:57)
great (91:56 - 91:59)
and then polka jobs just want me to (91:57 - 92:01)
bring pelico back because polygon was (91:59 - 92:02)
good (92:01 - 92:05)
yeah and you can plant berries there too (92:02 - 92:06)
many items (92:05 - 92:08)
i don't think there's too many items (92:06 - 92:10)
steve does they really i mean (92:08 - 92:13)
you know i would like to see a lot of (92:10 - 92:14)
the work that i do (92:13 - 92:16)
is like increasing efficiency by (92:14 - 92:18)
consolidating duplicative things and (92:16 - 92:19)
it's like (92:18 - 92:22)
do we need dna splicers reigns (92:19 - 92:24)
yeah like can we just get like this is (92:22 - 92:28)
the change the mode item (92:24 - 92:28)
that's all you need i mean that's (92:28 - 92:34)
steve's thing though (92:32 - 92:36)
i mean i don't disagree that there are (92:34 - 92:37)
too many (92:36 - 92:40)
key items for for mode changes (92:37 - 92:43)
yeah um what would i remove what would i (92:40 - 92:44)
remove (92:43 - 92:46)
anything i want to remove i want to (92:44 - 92:48)
replace like i would be like the bike (92:46 - 92:51)
because i want pokemon riding back (92:48 - 92:54)
yeah i mean i'd like i want i i'm not a (92:51 - 92:55)
huge fan of the bike (92:54 - 92:58)
it's fine i'm not thrilled about it but (92:55 - 93:00)
i don't hate it enough to remove it (92:58 - 93:03)
but i would prefer it to be like in sun (93:00 - 93:05)
and moon (93:03 - 93:08)
because that was fun although calling 18 (93:05 - 93:09)
different things was a little annoying (93:08 - 93:12)
it is nice that it's all in one (93:09 - 93:14)
they got rid of hms was the greatest (93:12 - 93:17)
things they ever did yeah (93:14 - 93:21)
i mean i could get rid of this sort of (93:17 - 93:24)
i could get rid i i don't like that (93:21 - 93:26)
there's tms and tr's (93:24 - 93:30)
um like you get so many tr's (93:26 - 93:32)
that it makes it almost pointless it's (93:30 - 93:34)
like i don't know if that's what they (93:32 - 93:36)
had planned on doing yeah (93:34 - 93:38)
but like that that didn't really add (93:36 - 93:39)
anything to the game (93:38 - 93:42)
i have you know 300 (93:39 - 93:44)
that's just another thing to collect (93:42 - 93:46)
yeah it's just another thing that (93:44 - 93:48)
racks up and you only ever use it on one (93:46 - 93:50)
or two (93:48 - 93:53)
so it it that division (93:50 - 93:54)
like i thought it was cool when i got (93:53 - 93:56)
i'm like oh cool and then (93:54 - 93:58)
eventually i realized oh i just have so (93:56 - 94:00)
many of these things (93:58 - 94:04)
that in essence they are all tms (94:00 - 94:06)
because i have so many of them and (94:04 - 94:07)
there's so few times that you're going (94:06 - 94:08)
to use one that's very specific that (94:07 - 94:10)
you're going to pop it on to one (94:08 - 94:12)
and the ones that are very common are (94:10 - 94:14)
already tms i think they should get rid (94:12 - 94:15)
of the move forgetter in the move (94:14 - 94:16)
remember (94:15 - 94:18)
because it makes it too easy for people (94:16 - 94:20)
get it right the first time or start (94:18 - 94:20)
over (94:20 - 94:24)
let's start over uh the only thing i (94:20 - 94:26)
think like repel doesn't do anything (94:24 - 94:27)
anymore (94:26 - 94:29)
yeah repel can go republican chairman (94:27 - 94:32)
rose get rid of chairman rose that (94:29 - 94:35)
was like i i would actually rather see (94:32 - 94:37)
do you know how they do the comic where (94:35 - 94:39)
it's like garfield without garfield (94:37 - 94:41)
yeah i want to just see the whole game (94:39 - 94:43)
where like (94:41 - 94:47)
chairman rose is an imaginary (94:43 - 94:49)
creature that everybody talks about but (94:47 - 94:51)
nobody ever sees but he's not actually (94:49 - 94:52)
there (94:51 - 94:54)
uh i got it i'm into that remake remove (94:52 - 94:55)
quick ball (94:54 - 94:58)
well then you have to remove timer ball (94:55 - 94:59)
nah timer was fine (94:58 - 95:01)
no they're pears not quick balls ugly no (94:59 - 95:02)
that yeah they come (95:01 - 95:06)
what have you ever caught a zapdos in a (95:02 - 95:06)
quick ball (95:06 - 95:11)
that's a match made in heaven no (95:06 - 95:14)
well that's why you fail yeah i mean (95:11 - 95:15)
like even even the beginning of the game (95:14 - 95:16)
like (95:15 - 95:18)
they don't even show you a catch (95:16 - 95:19)
tutorial if you catch a pokemon they've (95:18 - 95:21)
done pretty good over the years (95:19 - 95:22)
they've gotten they've gotten pretty (95:21 - 95:24)
good at streamlining a lot of the super (95:22 - 95:27)
annoying things (95:24 - 95:29)
i'm sure like 3am i'll wake up like no (95:27 - 95:30)
remove (95:29 - 95:34)
remove all of mystery dungeon (95:30 - 95:37)
the franchise oh come on now (95:34 - 95:39)
just because you don't enjoy it doesn't (95:37 - 95:41)
mean it's bad it's fine (95:39 - 95:44)
it's like cute but yeah it's like very (95:41 - 95:46)
hard for it to keep my interest (95:44 - 95:48)
we did another pokemon conquest that's (95:46 - 95:49)
what we need the game was pretty good (95:48 - 95:50)
except for the ending (95:49 - 95:52)
man they really grinded it out at the (95:50 - 95:54)
end there yeah they need (95:52 - 95:58)
a new pokemon shuffle we do (95:54 - 96:00)
and a new pokemon ranger let's not pay (95:58 - 96:02)
to win pokemon ranger oh (96:00 - 96:04)
the problem is we just don't have the (96:02 - 96:07)
styler anymore i know (96:04 - 96:09)
but it's a touch screen that's about (96:07 - 96:11)
pokemon ranger on the (96:09 - 96:15)
mobile oh that yeah that i'm into (96:11 - 96:17)
make that happen we'll give us our uh (96:15 - 96:18)
pokemon of the week (96:17 - 96:22)
well this is a mess because (96:18 - 96:24)
man i was so deeply asleep when you guys (96:22 - 96:26)
texted me but here last week's pokemon (96:24 - 96:30)
all right it was a poem uh (96:26 - 96:31)
here we go with the poem short enough (96:30 - 96:33)
i'll just read it thin and supple (96:31 - 96:35)
floating in the wind are you origami (96:33 - 96:37)
not the lawnmower not electric that is (96:35 - 96:39)
your brother your brother falsely named (96:37 - 96:40)
a tree (96:39 - 96:43)
you are the grass one not a pokemon but (96:40 - 96:44)
are you (96:43 - 96:46)
anything but beastly if you were you'd (96:44 - 96:47)
be the seed (96:46 - 96:50)
the thorn not the drawn sword all right (96:47 - 96:51)
i couldn't have made that easier for you (96:50 - 96:53)
folks come on (96:51 - 96:55)
it's (96:53 - 96:56)
[Music] (96:55 - 97:00)
proceed how so (96:56 - 97:03)
close and i yet you misinterpreted the (97:00 - 97:06)
last line of the poem completely it's (97:03 - 97:08)
cortana (97:06 - 97:12)
cortana correct whose shovel icon (97:08 - 97:15)
is incredible (97:12 - 97:17)
oh i mean cortana is just a great (97:15 - 97:19)
looking pokemon i love the design (97:17 - 97:21)
although you know i (97:19 - 97:24)
steve were you using one in battles yeah (97:21 - 97:25)
i was not (97:24 - 97:27)
i did not like it in sword and shield (97:25 - 97:28)
when i was watching it on screen (97:27 - 97:30)
i have to see it on my own but i was not (97:28 - 97:32)
impressed was it so tiny (97:30 - 97:34)
i think it was just it was moving (97:32 - 97:36)
weirder than i thought oh it kind of (97:34 - 97:38)
like floats as if it's made of paper (97:36 - 97:38)
it's not (97:38 - 97:40)
it's like solid yeah there's something (97:38 - 97:42)
off-putting about it i don't remember (97:40 - 97:44)
it's got the highest attack side of all (97:42 - 97:47)
grass types and steel types it's true (97:44 - 97:50)
because it's an ultra beast is that all (97:47 - 97:50)
the trivias (97:50 - 97:54)
there's some trivia here uh it is (97:50 - 97:57)
um in pokemon sun and moon cortana has a (97:54 - 97:59)
base catch rate of 255 (97:57 - 98:02)
which is the same as a pidgey due to a (97:59 - 98:04)
beast ball having a five times catch (98:02 - 98:06)
rate modifier that means (98:04 - 98:08)
one will never fail trying to catch a (98:06 - 98:10)
cortana in sun and moon (98:08 - 98:12)
despite being called ub slash in (98:10 - 98:15)
japanese kartana cannot learn the move (98:12 - 98:16)
slash (98:15 - 98:18)
and the anime cartana does speak the (98:16 - 98:20)
human language but in reverse i don't (98:18 - 98:22)
know if you guys have seen clips of that (98:20 - 98:26)
nope i have if you play it backwards it (98:22 - 98:28)
it's in english and it usually it's like (98:26 - 98:29)
usually (98:28 - 98:34)
them saying like i love to cut (98:29 - 98:37)
or like i need to cut this well (98:34 - 98:39)
that's the stuff at nightmares right (98:37 - 98:42)
there uh carton is cool (98:39 - 98:43)
i like cartrona quite a bit i like it a (98:42 - 98:46)
lot too it's uh of the ultra beast that (98:43 - 98:46)
i have (98:46 - 98:49)
disturbingly following me in the crown (98:46 - 98:50)
tundra (98:49 - 98:52)
it is my favorite all right this week's (98:50 - 98:54)
pokemon of the week (98:52 - 98:56)
it's a real short one it's a real easy (98:54 - 98:59)
one greg's already got it right (98:56 - 99:03)
uh here we go i was hardcore napping and (98:59 - 99:04)
completely missed the text messages from (99:03 - 99:06)
steve and greg letting me know that (99:04 - 99:07)
recording was starting (99:06 - 99:09)
so i did not have a lot of time to (99:07 - 99:11)
repair this week's pokemon (99:09 - 99:14)
in podcast lore this is the pokemon that (99:11 - 99:17)
greg defeated with a level 100 roselia (99:14 - 99:20)
i think it has a primal form and has (99:17 - 99:23)
been featured as the box art for two (99:20 - 99:23)
games (99:25 - 99:29)
this is the worst pokemon of the week (99:26 - 99:29)
