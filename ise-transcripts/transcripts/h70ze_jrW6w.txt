[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 435th episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective we've been doing this show for too long what's the sweet stuff i'm still the fresh-faced kid i'm the newbie new kid on the block i am here sbj here i messed up this whole intro will is here i want to keep things very positive this week i'm very motivated to keep things positive so if any of my ex-wives are listening your horrible people go away don't take me down how many are there now three oh okay there's only been three in the amount of time that you've known me i don't have secret wives that i'm parading around behind your back i don't know i'm not monitoring it every day 2020's been wild i don't know what you haven't haven't been doing certainly has greg here i am here almost done with masterchef australia season four eager to see what new horizon season 5 brings a living nightmare keep it positive greg keep it positive it's wonderful i am happy with the final five i don't know where we are on the show right now i napped quite a bit today while it was playing we have a uh this is gonna end up being a two-hour show i i try not to have these shows be two hours but there's always like some bit of news that you know we're gonna argue about for way too long and then at the end we just all shrug our shoulders and then yeah that's how we do i mean we don't have to argue about it just take my opinion as right like it is every time and then we can move on oh man greg you sound like my second wife so bad right now i told you i'm trying to stay positive don't sound like amy come on okay we even had a point though i'm sorry joanna was my second wife oh we're in it now we have masters news we have pokemon go news we have pokemon center news we have zarud that's probably one of the big things and then the biggest thing is the pokemon go to home which everyone has a lot of thoughts about let's start off with [Music] let's let's do the pokemon go news first because there's not a lot and then let's go into the pokemon go to home because i think that's our big topic and we might as well just get out of the way off pokemon go live.com there is a limited time test range increase from monday november 16th until monday november 16th so by the time this actually goes up it'll be over but i think it's still worth talking about because this is something that people trainers trainers if you're lucky we will increase the range again in the future ultimately what niantic did is they made it so you can trade up to 10 kilometers which i don't know how many miles that is because i'm american uh 6.2 because a 10k is a 6.2 mile race okay uh so you could trade up to 10k so it really lets you trade gosh that's not like a whole city well depends on how big your city is milwaukee is way longer than six miles uh i'm pretty sure greg only lives about five miles away from me and yes he might as well live in east egypt for that's pretty good distance you guys could trade right now we could i got nothing left to trade i've moved everything into pokemon home so that was temporary sure i i i guess they did it because of covid or that'll be the excuse they'll use i mean they should have done it but we know that i don't think trading like i think it's nice i think it's cool that like here's the thing i ain't got no friend i got no friends in the city to trade with there's plenty of podcast listeners in your city so uh yeah there's a couple i don't know if i'm specifically pokemon go friends with them but they did do it in a way where i mean you don't have enough time to become i could have added those people on thursday but by the time this is over i couldn't even become great friends which i think is seven days ten days you gotta you gotta reduce those stardust that stardust cost will ah true so this either leads to two things they either they either do this again and keep it at 10k and that's the new permanent cap or they open it up to be like worldwide temporarily so you can trade others but there's this artificial rarity of you can only get relic camp in new zealand unless you attended the pokemon world's event which was like three days long where relicanth spawned for three days in dc and i i don't think that rarity is bad or not fun because it does at least in my opinion it does get it does make me excited when i see somebody who is well not in 2020. well it did make me excited when i saw somebody traveling from a different country like our friend mark from australia who traded me a kangaskhan on my wedding day which was really cool that was before none of us had kangaskhan it wasn't kangaskhan i'm sorry it was chat i believe cause kangaskhan was in eggs and then chat was the new pokemon sorry mark i forgot what pokemon you traded me on my wedding day it was chat i remember it now congratulations mark mark had some good news recently so i'll just throw congratulations in since we're talking about him i mean people want worldwide trading right yes people want worldwide sale of pokemon which is why we originally suspected the trading was distance limited i'm sure they'll do it again i'm sure this was a test i'm not sure exactly what they were that they're testing like if it worked i guess it worked this is also off pokemon go live city spotlight rediscover your city with your buddy pokemon experience your city in a whole new way city spotlight is a new initiative we'll be launching in select cities for guy that guides trainers on adventures through their hometown or nearby places highlighting special locations for trainers who explore while making memories with their buddy pokemon kind of a tr like it's kind of like a treasure hunt i think this actually exists in ingress but i don't know what it's called and no one plays ingress you'll have the opportunity to discover exciting surprises by exploring outdoors and all while remaining socially distant through

tuesday november 10th to sunday november 22nd but tickets cannot be purchased with pokecoins and that that is the event i i i don't know the covid situation but anytime there's an event in a city that's going to be brought up in this day and age but i know new zealand is pretty safe and clear i don't think they have had any cases for the last month um i'm pretty sure south korea is really good yep you're correct that is correct uh yeah south korea has been very good about managing it uh i think japan is pretty okay uh at least i mean i mean in general nowhere is okay yeah i mean we just have to say that right now new zealand also had a spike they've all had spikes their spikes just have not been america's bad as a lot of other places particularly america so like let's be clear they don't have it completely under control they have it under better control it is probably slightly safer but there is still there is still risk there's still risk in all of these places it's less as long as they all remain outside and for new zealand and for a lot of places in the summer hemisphere they're heading into their summer so it is going to be warmer and more likely for them to be outside so it is safer but it's not safe it's not 100 safe so i guess the question is why is niantic even doing this if well i mean it's still an outside oriented event so yeah people can be safe outside yeah it does bring to mind that i've had this weird thing which i have made now maybe i understand a little bit but in my field research i have a little ar mapping thing that says to scan a particular thing and i'm like what what why why does it want me to do that [Laughter] that was like the thing they pulled from harry potter the ar scanning stuff but what's the point i don't know what it does because number one i don't need three potions right i don't know because anytime i spin a pokestop i'm like walking very fast because it's very cold outside so it's like ah you're not keeping me out here for two extra minutes to scan this thing niantic i don't need tenants no it's a field research i mean you do all your field researches no i throw away field researches oh i mean if it's if it's like 10 pokeballs or like three potions i'm throwing it away if it's a pokemon spawn i'll keep it but i don't need any more like right now i have fi catch five pokemon for five pin apps i don't need five pin apps i have 400 of them i i completely deleted every pokeball every potion every revive and every berry that i had in my inventory this morning how wait what how are you gonna oh ukulele deleted the pokeballs not the great balls all no i did all the balls i i i will i guaranteed i will have a hundred of each by this time tomorrow by urban time for community day tomorrow yeah i don't think the city spotlight is the worst thing in the world it's not the worst i mean it's fine i mean go outside be safe not that everyone can go outside but they're not asking you to go into a building they're not asking you to gather in groups it is still pretty i can say my situation is very easy for me to walk down walk out of the house walk to the park not see a single soul maybe see a couple people at the park the park is so big that it's very easy for me to not even come close to those people so i could still play pokemon go very safe at least in milwaukee but where i would prefer to play which is a mall i would not feel comfortable there because one it's indoors two there's a million people there not knowing how to wear masks yep three i definitely i don't want to be in that situation but uh the only reason i would want to go to the mall is because it's uh heated and uh not windy because it's inside it has bathrooms and it has bathrooms and it is getting very cold in wisconsin so it's gonna yeah with the right attitude the world is your bathroom so you don't really need to have that as a criteria but i think i do think i do think the general premise of do go to these pokestops which i think is what the the ideal is like go from this pokestop to this pokestop to this pokestop and then it is giving you a guide to explore the city and probably it would be like ideal if you've never been there before or maybe you don't get out to your downtown area before to like show you parts of the city you might not know i think that definitely exists in ingress although i don't know what it's called so i think niantic just brought this over from ingress there was an app back um gosh like eight years ago it was like when foursquare was blowing up um and i think it was called gowalla and yeah i remember that and that they had experience like that in the app so gowalla was a competition to foursquare except gowalla had these experiences i remember because i was very into koala and when i went to san fran when i went to san francisco for a job thing they had a bunch in that city so what you would do is you would open the app and it would say like here are eight things for you to visit and you would you would go to it and it would show you on the map of like the path to take and then you would check into each one and the idea was like here you've never been here before here's how you experience this part of the city and it was really really cool aren't they coming back they're coming back wallace coming back yeah part of me is excited for this niantic thing because if i do one day travel in the future to like taiwan or kyoto or auckland it would be cool to have an experience like that while playing pokemon go to be like hey you should go to this part of the city and visit these 10 locations and now we think that that's what is worth it for you to see i think that's cool yeah i was a bit just disappointed because they i just the way you know it's it's a news item that i actually read how strange i know and the way that the first part was written it's like coming to many cities it might be coming to your city and then i get to the list of cities and i was like these are weird cities that i've never visited and i don't have a way to get to right now because i don't even have a passport before we get to the go to home stuff mega changes to mega evolution in pokemon go pokemon.com since pokemon go has launched mega evolution in late august trainers have been had the opportunity to collect mega energy by battling in raids the ultimate goal of course is to give yourself an edge in raids by mega evolving select pokemon however the certain aspects of mega evolution require some fine tuning here are some implemented here are some implemented changes to begin with the pokemon that had previously mega evolved now require less mega energy for sub sub subsequent mega evolutions we have also increased the amount of mega energy that a trainer can receive for completing a raid these changes should make it easier to continue mega evolving your pokemon we are implementing additional changes soon including new ways to earn mega evolution mega energy outside of raids soon you'll be able to earn mega energy by walking your buddy or performing research tasks trainers will also receive a bonus of candy when catching a pokemon that is the same type as your mega evolve pokemon in the meantime keep earning mega energy keep a mega evolving and keep being the best trainer you can be i don't think there's any surprise there this is this is the i i i still stand by i said this like two months ago in the podcast that this had nothing to do with trainers complaining this is the same these are the same companies that made like dragon scales and upgrades really hard to get and now they're incredibly easy to get it was really hard to get a cinna stone like two years ago now they hand out cinna stones left and right it's kind of still hard to get you know the stone but i'm sure as soon as bennikin chespin and what's that frog called frookie show up i'm sure what's that frog uh i'm sure younova stones will be easier to get it's just like the pokemon go away oh yeah i mean to make it you know they make it easier for the filthy casuals out there god take advantage of your whales speaking of whales i don't know if that's a good transition where is that but speaking of whalers that's the transition you're looking for this is the press release here media alert pokemon go is now officially connected to pokemon home giving trainers the opportunity to transfer a pokemon from go to home this feature is rolling out to all trainers based on level as of this podcast it is available to everyone trainers will use the new feature in pokemon go called the go transporter to transfer pokemon from to from pokemon go to home every time you transfer a pokemon some energy will be drained from the go transporter the energy used by the go transporter will recharge over time but can be replenished with pokey coins the energy cost depends on the variety of pokemon you're transferring to celebrate trainers who transfer a pokemon from go to home will receive the mythical pokemon mel medal this mel medal can gigantomax in any battle and sword and shield that allows it mel metal will be received through a mystery gift on the mobile device version of home trainers then can use their nintendo switch version of home to transfer to mel metal to sword or shield add it to their team this is the first time giganta max male metal has been available to trainers you couldn't reference you couldn't use mac soup on male metal before and you still can't so don't miss out on this chance to team up with this mythical steel like pokemon after transferring a pokemon from go to home trainers can open the mystery box causing the rare mythical pokemon meltan to appear trainers can evolve mel tan to mel metal with 400 melting candy that is it's here it was kind of a lackluster launch i guess it kind of came as a surprise there was no like any week this is going to happen it was just like oh wait hey all of a sudden you can do it now suddenly it's here i mean it's before the end of the year which was their requirement i really thought they were going to wait till like two days i did too but they they didn't they what is like what three weeks for crown tundra now yeah okay so uh how do you guys feel about it what's the [Applause] i mean my basic thing and of course this is a very will anderson thing is i have literally read instructions on how to do it and i still can't figure out how to do it and i i'm just frustrated and i'm keep just saying to myself you know what you already have all of these pokemon and pokemon home you don't need no urgency in getting them over but man i'd really like to just be able to touch a pokemon and say send this one to home and it'll say okay you have enough and it'll go but this is the main problem like they like hid the button in the settings menu yeah i mean the buttons hidden in the settings menu the costs are hidden for all intents and purposes like how much things will eat up your transport energy yeah i do have the cost in front that we can talk about but yeah that's not very clear on what costs the refill price is either the most money grabby thing they've ever done or the we actually don't want you to use this feature because it's so stupidly expensive i think it's the latter person i mean that's just for now they'll they'll they probably bring it down at some point they sho it's ridiculous how expensive that is yeah this is this is like a weird conversation because we have to like you can't just talk about the price without acknowledging like what pokemon costs what in energy and that's hidden and it's so ugh and also why writing experience with all the crummy news alerts that this game gives you every time you try to start and just like i just want to start the game so i can send some gifts i don't need half an hour of eggs opening and this alert and that alert and why did they not send me a little news alert saying hey it's it's here and here's how you do it you guys just telling me that i had to go into settings that every instruction that i read on how to do this was well you have to be signed into your nintendo account okay nobody said go here decided i was like of course i'm signed into my nintendo account i live there yeah this is this has to be like a japanese pokemon thing because they they launched it they launched it at like 5 p.m central time on tuesday because i got access to it right away and i was like well i'm going to start my twitch stream early because uh that is going to be the talk of the night of like we can do this now how do you do this what did you transfer how much does it cost what's going on they didn't tweet they as in niantic and the pokemon company didn't tweet or didn't put out anything official until like 11 p.m central time which is 9 00 p.m pacific and then that is like it was what like uh noon in japan or something so they didn't do anything until japan said like hey this is this is ready to go so for almost for six hours it was available to level 40 but like no information existed besides figure it out yourself which for me it was it was pretty easy to figure out um but if you were like level 38 and you saw all these other people doing it and people are like and people are like well you got to go into your settings and you got to connect your nintendo account and that didn't appear uh like i understood because i we've been covering this dumb game for four years that it was that it was a slow rollout right i don't think i don't think most hardcore pokemon go players thought it was going to be restricted to level 40. i think most of us most of us who have been playing this game for a long time was like okay this is how they always do it when they did trading it was level 40 yeah when they did battles it was level 40 when they did raids it was level 40. but if you are a casual pokemon go player and you see that people are doing this and you're level 32 you're like where's my button what am i doing and so i was there on a twitch stream helping those people but not every unfortunately as it turns out not the entire world watches my twitch stream so they're on twitter being like i don't know what's happening they're on reddit being like what's going on why can't i do this now that everyone can do it that's fine and as of that evenings you know six hours after they launch it they go hey this is now available i don't understand why this button is hidden under the system settings but i i mean so i went in i just saw that it was available i went in i looked everywhere and i'm like well it's not here so then i checked to see if there was an update like in the absence of official information like there wasn't i mean i could have stopped for and i did think oh after i checked everyone knows i'm like oh this has to be restricted but since i didn't have that information up front and people like and there were a few things like hey it's out now and nobody's saying but it's restricted i did spend some time thinking is it broken am i missing it like i'm looking at screenshots and it's just not there and then eventually i'm like oh it is probably restricted to level 40s but they could have said something i'm assuming niantic couldn't say anything until the pokemon company tweeted first which is what happened the pokemon japanese account tweeted first then niantic tweeted then the english account tweeted but it was weird that they turned it on six hours before their tweet this company is just horrible about communicating things that's just fun they just need to hire me i'm i'm fantastic at communicating come on folks okay so before we get to the energy cost a couple things there are two pokemon specifically you cannot transfer um one is spinda and the other is there's more than two but yeah the other is black kirum slash white kirum you can transfer kirum but you cannot tran well black hair and white kieran technically aren't in the games but for whatever reason you cannot transfer those and you cannot transfer spinda the other things you cannot transfer the thing is just weird i mean assuming it has to do with the dot pattern right because there's like three billion spindas but there's only like nine of them and pokemon go and i guess they don't want those nine to be common and sword and like i don't i mean they're not in sword and shield right that's true i mean you could it's it's you could randomize them when you transfer them but then people would be mad i guess that they changed absolutely they would be mad but like you know they had to know the only thing i think of is they are trying to figure out what random string present makes that pattern and then we'll finally feed that to niantic sonanda can lock it in when it moves i guess their goal is like we don't want two spindles to be exactly the same but two spindles can be exactly the same and that was the whole point in pokemon go was like i can collect all the patterns right and i mean see this is where like pokemon go mentality fights with the other pokemon games mentality because in a traditional pokemon game it's i will get random spinda hopefully i enjoy the pattern and in pokemon go it was like there are these nine patterns i must collect all nine of these patterns i mean people saying that they can't be two spinders are the same people say that there can't be two snowflakes that are the same there can be i mean yeah there can be but the likelihood of you finding them is rare because but ice crystals only grow in a certain pattern and there is an institute that determines spin to spots so they need to figure that out and lock it into place or they're just going to keep it trapped and go forever it's just a yeah isn't it a big deal it's just a weird it's a weird thing on top of a bunch of other weird things that they did look i don't i mean there's only probably like two people out there in the entire world that are upset that their spin cannot be moved over and one of them is a really good friend of mine and i'm sure oh that dude's never played pokemon go i'm sure that they're actually mad that's not true but can we talk about the real issue here which is i can't move any of my hat pikachus yeah well we knew that was coming they they said like a month ago that most costumes won't be moved over but i refuse to accept this i refuse that that is in so many games and in home i mean you can move cosplay pikachu and auras yeah but okay the annoying thing is that of all the pokemon in the universe the ones that make that are like these are real special pokemon go pokemon that it's like i would want to have in pokemon home with my collection of my all this pokemon that i love and adore are the costume ones yeah otherwise it's just like i i mean i just moved a shiny pikachu and i'm like all right great shiny pikachu i could have read that myself in any number of different pokemon games but a witch hat pikachu no i only got that in pokemon go let the witch hat pikachu free i mean they could it could happen at a later date i'm like hit and miss on the hat pikachu stuff because part of me is like it'd be cool if you can move them over but part of me is like it's just gonna sit there in a box and collect dust because it's not like i'm actually like i have all of the hat pikachus from sun and moon when they did the like ash hat pikachu stuff i have not redeemed by the way redeem your happy choose for sword and shield you have uh as of this podcast 15 days but not once have i moved those hat pikachus into sun and moon ultra sun and moon sword and shield to be like let me look at these pikachu like i redeemed them they went into my box they have been sitting there for three years i have never looked at them again all hat pikachu competitive team so i kind of feel the same way about like as much as i do like collecting the the the bulbasaur with the cubone skull and the pikachu with the wish hat which hat like i'm fine that they can't be moved over now it'd be nice if they can move over in the future but like right now i don't think it's the end of the world if they can't figure out spinda what i can say is that if you move over your cast form because in pokemon go you can collect all five versions of cast form it will default to normal cast form if you move over your cherum it will default to overcast if you move over to geratina it will change it to altered your zen darmanitans will change to galler your if there's no keldio in the game but the data miner says if you move your keldeo resolute it will turn into kelvio ordinary no melody in the game but if you move melodies i don't know what that word means it will pirouette melody aria is a dance style and ballot oh okay so forms will revert uh lucky and purified pokemon will lose their lucky and purified statuses which i think going back to the hat pikachu i think this is more important than the hats i think lucky pokemon is something that they should bring to the main series games because it would encourage trading obviously that doesn't exist yet but i i personally hope in future games lucky is a thing that carries over to remix or gen 9 or gen 10 or something i think that's like a really cool mechanic pokemon you you send from home cannot be moved back you know that uh when you do move by pokemon to home from a go and then go to sword and shield the pokemon absorbs the the trainer id that home is set in uh not go and the other thing is if you nickname a pokemon in go for example if you nickname it like trademe and then you send it to home it removes the nickname when you move that to sword and shield uh you can change the nickname once because it defaults like if you traded an axle with you know the nickname was whatever it changes it back to absol in home when you move it to sword and shield you can take it to the nickname guy he'll say like you this is not your pokemon you can only nickname it once are you sure you want to change it so i tested all that uh i believe also i'm looking at this chart of everything that we need to cover pokemon with a ribbon so if you earn like the buddy is what is it called the buddy ribbon if you earn the buddy ribbon on a pokemon and you transfer that from go to home uh it loses the ribbon pretty much it loses ribbon it loses lucky it loses uh purified shadow pokemon you can't even transfer you have to purify them before you transfer you cannot transfer your buddy pokemon is when it's equipped as your buddy you have to unequip it unequip it what is this magic the gathering you can't move a mega evolution you can't move a pokemon that's defending a gym i think those are pretty obvious you get the mystery box okay i think that covers all the mechanics the the the debate the the point of contention here is the transporter energy so they introduced an item called the transporter the transporter is what you use to move from point a to point b the transporter has this huge bar with no numbers on it that there is a secret hidden number which is ten thousand if you transfer some pokemon that bar gets lowered they don't tell you what a pokemon is worth because the pokemon company i guess hates numbers i don't know yeah and they don't tell you how much energy you earn but you get 10 000 and you earn 60 an hour which is one a minute pokemon are worth something so a let's just say it's a let's just say you're you have a b doof a b doof just you know maybe 13 c p b doof is worth 10 energy so ideally if you're the biggest b do fan in the world and you've caught every b do if you've seen you can transfer a thousand b-dupes a week which is a lot of b-dupes there's a lot of doof and i think what we were maybe suggesting or talking about a couple weeks ago is maybe they only let you transfer 10 pokemon a week and when i asked my twitch chat when we asked slack and when i asked on instagram and when i asked on twitter a lot of people were like hey if it lets me do 10 pokemon a week i'm happy for free because we knew there was going to be a cost for quote unquote normal pokemon your deerlings your magnemites your bulbasaurs your charmanders your beedoofs you can do anywhere between 300 to a thousand a week which is a lot of pokemon yeah i feel like people don't care about that well they made it complicated though right because they added the cp right that's where they add to the cost yeah so the reason i said between 3 300 to 1 000 is because if it's under if it's under 1000 cp yep it's a thousand or less that it's ten but if it's above a thousand there's like a like a hundred there's like a hundred extra cost so instead of it being ten transporter energy it's a hundred and ten transporter energy and then if it's like a charizard not regular charizard at like 2500 cp anything over 2 000 gets a 300 extra cost ultimately what this means is a normal b doof is either going to be 10 energy to transfer 110 energy to transfer or 310 energy to transfer depending if it has cp under a thousand a thousand two two thousand or two thousand plus which is this weird hidden cost that they don't really talk about yep but for the most part it's worse 300 pokemon a week is still a lot of pokemon it's still a lot i mean if you're just wanting to clear out your storage that's fine if you're wanting to clear out your storage it's fine if you if you have a a living dex which i i think a lot of hardcore go players do if you have a living dex from bulbasaur to hirom i guess right well there's a couple gen five missing uh you know uh calculator missing but you can technically move all your non-legendary non-mythical pokemon from gen one to gen five in an instant i mean besides like tapping the button to highlight them all like you can move 500 plus pokemon in a day which is to fill out your living decks which is pretty awesome in my opinion where it gets complicated where people started to get mad at this is three different types of pokemon four i should say well and there's a you left out the shiny cost oh that's what i'm about to talk so there is mythical pokemon which have a different cost than legendary pokemon uh which which those two costs pretty they're both pretty expensive which i think the three of us would agree that mythical and legendary pokemon should be more expensive than a b doof i don't think anyone's sure debating that and then there is a shiny pokemon uh which has its own cost and then there's the final cost of a shiny pokemon that is legendary and or mythical they're technically different costs but ultimately they're they're pretty the same we'll get to that so a regular pokemon is going to cost you between 10 transport energy to 310 transport energy and you have 10 000. and then when you get to a mythical pokemon or a legendary pokemon a legendary pokemon will cost you a thousand transport energy so ideally you could transfer 10 legendary pokemon a week but of course the cp comes into play if the legendary pokemon is above 1000 cp then it becomes a little bit more expensive and then if it's above 2000 cp it becomes a little bit more expensive so let's just say for the sake of this conversation you can move about six legendary pokemon a week i think that's the average um from what from everything i tested all the combinations of selecting articunos or selecting heat trans or selecting cresselias or selecting some kyogres and some heat trans so you can do about six legendaries a week maybe seven if you have some cheaper mythical pokemon of a base cost of two thousand so they're twice as expensive as legendary that i guess makes sense mythical pokemon are more rare than legendary that's the really the main difference here and again there's some different costs so if the mythical is above 2000 or above whatever it costs a little bit more expensive this all makes sense and then we get shiny pokemon which have its own cost so a shiny pokemon will be base 2000 technically yeah so we'll just say base 2000 so if you could move about six legendary a week you can maybe move about four to five mythical a week and then that kind of lines up with shiny pokemon which is shiny pokemon you can maybe move about five you could technically move five a week there's a weird reason why this works but for the sake of the conversation right now we'll say you can move about five shiny pokemon a week and then a shiny is safer to say four because of the cp cost yeah you can for sure almost always move four okay but yeah if you have a really high cp shiny like non-legendary are you really moving that or are you keeping that for like raids cause who's powering up shinies you don't know me yeah i guess like greg actually checks the value of a pokemon after he catches it and i'm like why are you wasting your time i only have like live your life maybe like 10 shinies that have powered max up but that's because their stats were good and i planned to keep them and go forever because of raid carries i guess i don't know i guess yeah you could have a lot of maybe you just like powering up shinies but you didn't no one knew that there was going to be this weird cost based off cp so the the uh the last exception so we talked about legendaries let's say maybe uh six a week shinies about four to five a week technically more because you don't have to wait a full week to start transferring again um mythical is about four a week and then there's the last one that i think this is the one that made people very very angry which was the shiny legendary shiny mythical which costs the entire ten thousand it takes the whole bar so you can only do one of those a week and that is that is the transporter in a nutshell and i think because of that last one that we brought up one mythic shiny mythical one shiny legendary a week i think people don't care about the other stuff we talked about which is like hey you could move 300 to 000 plus cp badoofs in an instant like people don't care about that because those pokemon are common they might already have them they they really want to focus on their their legendaries their mythicals their shinies which are the rarest pokemon in these games it's kind of like the trophies that you hunt for i guess the majority of people that are complaining are unhappy that they can only move like five shiny pokemon at a time and i guess my thought process is i think a shiny should be worth a lot in in comparison to a hundred bidoofs uh especially since like a shiny is like what most people have reported or the silph road is reported like as shiny as one out of 450 minus community day stuff right which is only existed for three hours and then it goes back to the one in 450 or whatever it is i think shinies should be a lot i think that chinese should cost more than legendaries personally because even in main series games you are guaranteed legendaries just by playing you are not guaranteed chinese while in a main series game you will only get the one mewtwo you will only get the one kyogre you will only get the one groudon through your playthrough you could restart your game and get a second one but that's time consuming you know i played pokemon for 18 years before i got my first shiny in a main series game so i would argue that legendary should be expensive but chinese should also be more expensive and then ultimately your grand trophy would be a shiny legendary which would be the most expensive so i think in a hierarchy of costs i think the order is correct like i think a shiny should be worth more than a legendary which i think is how the math works out yeah and it does and a mythical should be about the same cost as a shiny but a shiny legendary mythical should be the most expensive i just don't think people are happy with that in the sense of like well i can only move five and i have 400 chinese so it's gonna take me all year to move that like i understand that complaint i get it i i don't think them saying you can move 10 chinese a week makes that better i think they would i think they would still have the same complaint of well instead of taking eight months it's gonna take me five months i'm still mad but i think i mean i think part of the thing is that the costs are hidden and the one cost that isn't hidden is outrageous the the briefly the transporter how much can i pay to throw more energy into my transporter ten bucks ten dollars ten for ten thousand ten for ten thousand well ten well it depends so if your transporter is halfway full you pay five so it is you pay five but if it's completely empty you pay 10. i i can see them offering discounts and uh when i have my subscription i will actually get double transporter energy per month or something like that this is my opinion on the transporter i think they set it so high so no one pays it i don't think i mean that's not true people will pay it people will pay it but but if they wanted to maximize revenue i don't think ten dollars is it i think that if they would have said it at two or three dollars they would have made more money because people are more likely to go it's the same instance of if you were doing raids with a friend and you ran out of raid passes i've done this to greg a million times and i go for it and i go come on greg it's only a dollar this is our last rate of the night just just get it and then greg goes always the last six raids are always the last raid of the night and you go and you go yeah you're right it's only a dollar but there's a huge mindset between it's only a dollar or it's only three dollars too it's ten dollars it's ten dollars i think that the cost was strategically placed so when people go it is not i want to move my shiny darkrai that has used up my entire bar i do not want to pay ten dollars to move my shiny deoxys i will just wait six days and i think most people accept that logic of i'll just wait but if it was two or three dollars i would say more people would go well it's only two and three dollars i'm only going to do it once but it's never once right no you know how many people bobby i'm calling out bobby bobby has texted me several times of i'm never going to buy incubators again and every single event that dude buys incubators and goes well i spent 15 on incubators i didn't get any shinies like i think the cost was set high because there will be there there are definitely people out there with look i actually like the 10 cost because what the 10 cost tells me is that something i can work forward to in life when i am so comfortable in life that i can spend ten dollars to move a dark cry and it is nothing to my bank account i have more money than time then niantic has given me the the golden ladle of steve we're proud of you you've made so much money irl that you can just it's it you it doesn't even matter anymore move all your dark cry right now i will say this i i disagree with your people will just accept that logic and be fine with it i don't think they're fine with it i think they look at that prohibitive cost and say well i guess i have to wait and that dissatisfaction is a dangerous game for them to play is it dissatisfaction of people who are just impatient or is no i was i was not happy with that price and i have you're never going to pay that price there's nothing we're going to pay it yeah when i look you play pokemon go every day i when i looked at that price i went you have got to be kidding me okay even if that price was like three dollars to refresh why would you pay it you you you log into pokemon go every day is there is there some dire need where you need all 50 of your shiny squirtles in a different place that you're never going to do today coming up tomorrow yeah but that that that is that is the need there's the rub he's gotta dump out those boxes your laziness talking you could go through and you could clear out so many pokemon delete delete the not delete your bee dupes delete your no because you're gonna be like trade me something super old so i get it lucky because i don't have it you are part of the problem steve you're like don't get rid of that because that's from like 2016 and then you can trade it to me because i don't have that lucky yet this is what you do you enable the problem and then you yell at people for reacting to you enabling the problem i think the more important thing that the pokemon company and niantic has done here is force you force you as the player to come back to their game and i think that is more important than making money up front because pokemon go or any other mobile game wants you to log in every day and they want they want you to think about their game consistently and now this is another layer of you thinking about their game of like this uh every tuesday i get to transfer my five pokemon or my or i'm looking forward to next tuesday when i'm going to transfer my dark cry uh my shiny dark cry it it you coming back to the game i think is more important than them making ten dollars up front it's it's a risk because a week is a long time and if you aren't playing that consistently and you are really excited about moving things over every year back in the game and you hit that wall thinking oh i'll just come back in a week that's that is seven days of a person who is dissatisfied not opening their game and then trying to remember oh right if you had enough time to go to twitter to complain about the price and then in a week you forgot to log in to move your pokemon you are just the biggest baby in the world like you you are part of the problem like if this was such a big deal that you needed to tweet at niantic to be like the prices are too expensive and then two weeks pass and you go oh i haven't even logged in to go to transfer my pokemon do you actually really care or are you just complaining well it's both here's here's the thing of years in customer service that initial reaction is the true reaction when somebody is angry and they go somewhere to complain about it that is in the moment and then as they deal with those emotions and they shove that game aside so they don't have to be angry that is the end result it is all tied together in the bad customer service cycle we get it all the time i have worked in customer service for 24 years people will call you when they're angry and when you try to follow up with them they're like i don't want to think about this anymore i'm done i said what i wanted to do but when they are talking to their friends when they're talking to their family and they say well why don't you play that anymore oh it was just a cheap rip-off money grab and i just can't deal with it anymore like that negative press is not what you want and it doesn't matter if you think oh because they had time to go to twitter and complain of course it did because they're in the anger in the moment that's how bad customer service works i think if this was a money grab though they would have lowered the price they would they i guarantee they would have made more money if the price was lower because people would have been more inclined to hit that button so what you're saying is it's more in line with my philosophy of they are hardcore judging people who wasted their lives to get hundreds of shiny legendaries when they could have been out there living in the world i don't i don't think anything is wasted like if you are doing something with those pokemon they will stay in go like i have no reason to move my shiny darkrai from go to home because it is my main dark attacker that i use in psychic raids like against chris celia so that pokemon that i use every psychic raid or a lot this past month because of ghost raids too like that pokemon that i am consistently using every day is not going anywhere the poke the other two darkrai that i have never touched that have been sitting there for a year plus because shiny darkrai was first available like a year ago like yes i will eventually move those darkrai over but they will go from not being touched and collecting dust and go to not being touched and collecting dust in home like it's it's the uh real life analogy of like well uh i guess we gotta move our christmas decorations from the basement to the attic like yup you're gonna move your shiny squirtles from the basement that is pokemon go to the attic that is pokemon home and they're not going like it's not super vital to move those over if you were like uh i only got a shiny huntail in pokemon go and i need to use this i want to flex this shiny huntail in a tournament coming up next week yeah you would just move it over then and do that but but like this like need of i need to dump 500 shinies like today it is not in my opinion that dire of a need nor do i think niantic nor the pokemon company wants you to do that because if you were to dump all your pokemon all your rare pokemon at once you may be more you may be less inclined to come back to the game because now you've you've like that is the attachment that you have i don't know what the word is for that is so there you go that is i think the clearest explanation of your point right there is that if people dump all of their pokemon out of pokemon go they're not going to come into pokemon go anymore so put up a high barrier to keep people from doing that correct it's like when i when i played it's like when i played fallout 3 every single day back gosh when did that come out i played fallout 3 every single day when it came out loved it put hours into it like five hours a night for like five months and then uh my roommate saved over my game and i lost everything and i just from a from a game that i played every day and that i loved i just had no desire to start over to go back because i that that separation broke and i think that that is ultimately why this slow drip is in effect because if you were to take everything that you cherished in go and you were able to move it instantly and we already know that's not normal pokemon no one is cherishing their 40 badoofs they caught last week they they cherish those shinies they cherish those legendaries if you move them to one place you break that separation with go and you might not log in to go that's why i don't think that ten dollars is the thing that matters i think i think that if they wanted to make money they would reduce it up front because people would be more willing to pay it i think the ten dollars is boy that price sucks i'll just wait a week and then you do that every week and now you have something to look forward to you're logging in you're reading the news you're seeing what events are going in you're watching the spawns change i think that is that is from a business perspective the smartest thing they could have done i i don't think that it's the smartest thing they could have well i think in customer retention like you are you are you are banking that more people will be fine waiting than aren't and more people will be fine waiting on the people who aren't happy burning out and not trashing your game or your company those are two big risks and especially now since everybody's tech at home and they have nothing else to do those are two really big risks of we're gonna launch something and people aren't going to be happy about it and the people who aren't happy about it are way louder than the people who are that is just the fact of business and i it is it is an absolute risk it is a it is a bigger risk than i think you're downplaying i think i think though they know the back end of the risk they know how many people used bank they know how many people used bank to home they know how many people connected go to let's go so i think on their end we we will never see those numbers we'll never know but they i can't imagine that they were like well fifty this is the same company that accidentally leaned on a button and turned off shinies hey i know i i actually i i side with steve on this i think for the people who have already what do we got four years in now is that how long we've been in this who have made that much of an investment into their pokemon go collection that it's it's gonna take much more than this for them to walk away from pokemon go they will definitely complain i mean they will complain but they will continue playing because it's like i have already put so much time into this game yeah it's it's i mean if there weren't other questionable decisions leading up to this one i would be much more on the point but they've already done a number of things that are very cash grabby they've reduced bonuses for being stuck at your home for no good reason like they have built up a lot of negativity already so this isn't coming into a we all love this game where we're all neutral with this game they're walking into a somewhat hostile environment and dropping a big bomb and the fact that they hide those numbers the fact that they aren't upfront and transparent with how much you can and can't transfer adds to that frustration and i think it's a very dangerous game that they already have a bunch of people frustrated with raid pass grabs incubator grabs all of these things and then have this be another barrier it it adds to that frustration and i think that's much harder for them to quantify like they know how many people connected to x y z but that doesn't that was at a different point in time than where we are now and there's a huge risk now because they've angered a lot of people about a lot of things in a short amount of time recently but i think right now they probably they probably know that people are mad and they probably don't want people dumping all their pokemon because that will separate them from the game and they want people to keep logging in it's yeah they may i i stick by the fact that they are playing a very risky game they'll never tell us what happens right but yeah i i think they are really taking risks with their good name that don't need to be taken i i still think though if they allowed 10 shiny pokemon a week instead of five i still think we would have the same reaction i agree i think if they were transparent with the costs and they were very transparent with or they lowered the price to refill we would have a very different conversation but the fact that they a made it hard to find b were terrible at communicating it c you have to go to third parties to find the costs and then if you did that and didn't understand the refresh rate or anything and you saw oh it's going to take another week for this to refill up or i have to pay ten dollars like that's bad bad bad bad bad bad bad yeah like that's a bad experience all the way down because they just refuse to be transparent and that hurts them as a company that anytime i don't think that's nice though i think that's the pokemon company yeah but niantic's going to take the brunt of that oh yeah yeah yeah which is bad i mean that's just a bad deal to be in yeah the pokemon company hates assigning numbers to their pokemon that aren't like level h and like level and hp values like they don't want us to know that it's one in 25 on community days even though we all know it's what it talks about it's so in the year that we live in in in the world that we live in and the people that do this research just stubbornly be like no no we're just you know even though everybody can figure it out no it's like it's like i do one of the things that drives me crazy with people who run role-playing games like we've all figured out what number we have to hit to be able to hit the monster stop being coy about it we all figured it out five minutes ago you can just tell us it doesn't change the game it just makes it faster so greg you see secretly come out as a game gobbler i see how it is i'm not a game goer like i'm one of the people that looked at well i'm not paying that and since i already play it every day it's like whatever i'll move it i just moved enough that i had space on community day if i do it my apathy for the game keeps me from being angry at the game because i honestly like been like oh yeah i should log into that today and do some stuff but if i don't i don't you know i'm not super invested in pokemon go one way or the other i do it to be able to play with like community days with you and i'll do it to keep up with certain things like oh i should just log in today because i'm sitting on lunch and it's just there but i am not invested in the game anymore that ended a very long time yeah i mean i'm still like happy with go as it turns out like i still like go um and as as as i do agree that i i kind of wish i could move over more of the pokemon that are rare to me like deoxys like i can only move what like five dioxis a week i think i calculated on stream and i would have like just a tiny little bit left it would take me months because i i think i have like 81 deoxys because i never threw away a deoxys um so 5 times what 10 12 like like over 10 weeks to move 80 some deoxys over like no one needs add accesses but the reason the the reason i never have thrown away a legendary ever or a mythical ever or a shiny is because even though i now have 30 shiny squirtles or i have 81 deoxyses not everyone has a deoxys like deoxys or what it's worth is still pretty rare like yeah you could have bought omega ruby alpha sapphire gone through it got the dx at the end but not everyone played that game not everyone had forty dollars so for me the value was i want all of these mythicals i want all these legendaries that i eventually i'm for the most part paid money for uh whether it was a free raid pass or a dollar raid pass or a dollar fifty remote raid pass and now that i will be able to move these deoxes over eventually um i can trade them to people and i could be like here is like i'd trade me a pidgey i don't care here's a deoxys for you so like like that that is exciting to me like the same way uh like getting christmas presents for people is like i don't care about receiving christmas presents but i like giving christmas presents so like yeah even though i can't move all add accesses over this weekend i'm also probably not finding 80 people in a single weekend to be like here's a deoxis actually i probably could find 80 people on my twitch i mean yes but like yeah i'm not in a rush but i i also think that like this will change in the future they will make it so you will be able to move more pokemon in the future future they're just drip feeding it and i i do agree that it can it has we've seen it cause frustration with people because they wanted to dump their pokemon and now they have to set an alarm every wednesday to be like okay this is the day i move another five shiny squirtles i mean people get resentful of an outside thing that tells them how they have to interact with thick thing like that is just that is always a that is always a resentmaker i eventually resented animal crossing again for making me have to be there every day like there is a resent that builds up when something that is supposed to be fun demands you to come on their schedule all right well that's been talked to talk to forever on the flip side the rest of the news we have is not that controversial controversial that's what you think that's what you think we wait till we talk about the pokemon center arriving to canada and how we should shut it down okay we'll take a quick break and when we come back we have zeroed canada and some pokemon master stuff we will be right back hey uh what do you guys think about pumpkin spice spice pumpkin spice pumpkin spice frosted flakes pumpkin spices pumpkin spice mini wheat pumpkin spices pumpkin spice pumpkin spice pumpkin spices [Music] pumpkin spice and we are back from our break we have a little bit of masters news they introduced two new characters so figured we cover them first one was an oh actually this article covers both of them uh the softpokemon.com nate and braver braviary and bianca and musharna and time trials come to pokemon masters ex there is a flurry of activity happening in masters ex i don't know about flurry but okay there's activity happening in master cx a full disclosure i am partnered with dna kicking off two new trainers of unova region from november 11th through the 29th the flying type sink pair nate and braviary and the psychic type sink pair bianca and musharna will be available both five star sync pairs can be raised to sync 6 star ex from november 15th to the 29th you will also have a chance to scout two new sink pairs that appea that appeared briefly last year's holiday season rosa and delhi bird and cybold are an artillery both five-star sink pairs this year rosa can be raised to six star ex new and recurring sink pairs could serve you well in the new time trial event which challenges you to win battles in the shortest possible time the faster you complete the more points you earn you can exchange your points for a variety of rewards you may need to rethink your strategy to get the shortest time that's it that's pretty much it uh i think it's kind of a little early for rose and deliberate but i i guess sure i mean start start christmas now uh my assumption is there's gonna be a new christmas pair that's why they're doing these from the 15th to the 29th i could see that deliberate could also be thanksgiving i mean yeah if you cook them sure that was my intent there's no surprise with bianca and musharna here i think that was very obvious uh bravery and nate that seems fine sure i protest but whatever that seems all right i guess i can't remember what else like nate uses because you're nate technically right yep nate is any good i don't know i haven't heard any either of those two pairs as being great like i've not heard anybody saying oh really pull this this is like they're super good like alder was supposed to be really good which i never got oh they're still going though right they didn't pull them yet yeah yeah well i guess i was going to pull for alder and nate but i guess i'm gonna pull for rosa and cybold because they're limited and like nate and bianca and alder or not they just go back into the pool afterwards the pool the pool of ever growing characters yeah do we know what bianca is supposed to do uh i do not look into that now she just exists as far as i'm concerned i treat bianca the same in every game she just exists [Music] it's funny because it's true this is uh off this is another press release that was sent to me mythical pokemon zed rude to debut in new pokemon animated movie the pokemon trading card game and the video game distribution today today the pokemon company international announced that the mythical pokemon zeroed will start in the next animated film they act like we've done didn't know this film existed pokemon the movie secrets of the jungle the latest and the latest pokemon trading card game expansion that announced today which was vivid voltage and it will appear in the best-selling pokemon sword and shield video games in the upcoming distribution so this movie was called pokemon the movie coco in japan they can't figure out how to spell it is some some of their promotional material is c-o-c-o some is k-o-k-o maybe america thought let's just not deal with this and let's just rename it two secrets of the journey the newest animated film of the beloved pokemon franchise pokemon the movie secrets of the jungle will be coming to fans in the world in 2021 this will actually come in japan on christmas day trainers can watch the official trailer here it is just the japanese trailer with english voices the 23 third animated film tells the story of coco now the english release is spelling it koko a young boy raised by pokemon and the creation of a new bond between humans and pokemon deep in the jungle far from any human settlement in the forest of okoya a pokemon paradise forbidden to outsiders protected by a secret code of rules in this jungle lives coco a human boy who has been raised by the mythical pokemon zarud koko has grown up never doubting that he is a pokemon but one day a chance meeting ash and pikachu leaves coco with his first human friend is he truly a pokemon question mark or is he in fact a human question mark if you're lucky trainers you may too find the threats of the forest of okoya and the bonds between pokemon and human as well as the love between a parent and a child will be put to the test is this gonna be like zaru doesn't trust humans no pokemon trust humans absolutely also uh coco is a ditto yeah you think coco is a ditto i'm sure you're throwing that out there right now what if he's a zoro he's a zarara i mean do you think they had to spell coco with a k because coco with the c is already a movie and another property yeah i thought they would spell it with a c because they didn't want to have confusion of tapu coco but yeah then they falls into the other coco movies with the very litigious other company that owns that movie this is the one where like there is a coco card coming and it is technically the boy so maybe the boy maybe the boy is celebi no that doesn't make sense because celebi is no celebrity celebrity is made only a celebrity coke maybe he's immune you can transform oh ditto zarua zorak that's for pokemon i don't know do we think that coco will be able to speak to ash having never been around humans oh yeah the power of pokemon gives you anything yeah i i mean i'm assuming there's time travel in the movie that's why celebi is there that's right celebi is in the movie don't forget so maybe he is a boy but at the end they time travel back so we all forget that they are releasing a tcg card of a human maybe that's the goal um does this movie sound good or does it already sound like a hot mess uh it sounds look they can't go worse than the power of us right no they can't valid so is this in the power of us universe or is this in the other universe i think this is in the universe that split with i choose you which is just because it's just ash because all of those movies have just been ash ash and pikachu so the assumption is ash doesn't use any of his pokemon besides pikachu so we never know what he has his uh rival his companions are not with him like they were you think coco can be caught in a master ball well who would waste their master ball on a human it's the rarest no it's the most dangerous game and chase it down cannot possibly be bad because there's a cramer ant in it well there you go there's no way this is this is the munchlax and the hot dog machine argument again that was a good movie definitely it definitely could be bad in everything around that one moment no no no no no there was nothing there was no good pokemon in the power of us what were you gonna say bonsai is fun no one can no why would i in what universe am i defending power of us right but that's why the power of us is bad that's what i'm saying the the power of us was bad because of the pokemon choices in the movie oh it was bad for more than the pokemon choices but the pokemon choices set it up to be bad they didn't help if if you're a director and you've already picked bad pokemon you have already made bad choices beyond the script that's what i'm saying this person picked crammer aunt to be in the movie he can't possibly he or she cannot possibly write a bad movie if they have good taste in pokemon that is the logic that i am applying here that is the bad logic you're applying there you're assuming that they're that they're the same person that's making those choices we know that many people work on these films yeah yeah that's true that's true what pokemon were even in power of us there's one that doesn't aurora [Laughter] not yeah well i mean yeah lugia for about 45. not even 45 seconds lugia was like maybe 15 seconds sarah aura didn't even get more than like five minutes of screen time and they didn't still the thing that boggles my mind is zera aura is just getting wrecked and ash is like no it wants it this way i'm like i'm pretty sure it doesn't i'm pretty sure it's getting wrecked it would like some support kid gosh that movie was bad okay more to this press release the new tcg sword and shield vivid voltage has been released zarud makes its debut how did we not figure this out why why is everyone dumb everyone looks like like remember when they showed the one trailer back when the isle of armor came out and then the the the the ceo of the pokemon company the rich guy who no one ever complains at because they would rather complain to masuda instead the guy who runs the pokemon company ishihara he's sitting there and he's sitting there in front of like uh like a an umbreon and a espeon plush and he has like the the nintendo switch in the background with evie and pikachu on it and people are like let's go johto is coming look at the sign is on the wall how did we not like but no one goes hey the root is coming out in vivid voltage i bet they announced as a rude distribution when vivid voltage comes out because now they have to actually acknowledge the rude in america like yeah it like super obvious in retrospect that like because nobody cares about that i mean they want that let's go johto i guess yeah they care about that the rude is in vivid voltage as a card it is available now if you can find it there's also a new type of card called amazing pokemon amazing pokemon feature legendary or mythical pokemon illustrated with vividly rainbow backgrounds that extends outside of the frame as well as foiled and etched details of a special rarity symbol when you thought that they couldn't make this is the real money grab it's not pokemon home it's not the ten dollars it's the it's this this is this hidden rarity they keep introducing in the tcg yup because first it was like oh you only had rare and then it was like okay now you have ultra rare oh now you have secret rare now we have the rainbow rare now we have these gold shiny rare now you're telling me that there's these amazing rares i can't keep up there's 180 cards on this set uh six amazing rares six v-max including pikachu v-max or beetle v-max colossal v-max shown in their gigantomax form 11 v cards plus 13 full art v cards the tcg is the ultimate scam well yeah that's why i've been i've been telling people tggs have been ultimate scam for a long time all tcgs are the ultimate scam yes yes and steve you're like if i come when i come there i'm gonna make you play pokemon tcg playing the tcg is not the same as collecting the tcg it's still a scam because the good cards people know them and then they break them out of packs and sell them for five million dollars that's true uh so scam so here is how zarood will be distributed everything the entire franchise this podcast is a scam we have a patreon ise dot cash in further celebration of zarud and the appearance in pokemon the movie the secrets of the jungle and the pokemon trading card game trainers will be able to receive zeroed in sword and shield game by signing up for the pokemon trainer club email notification by november 20th i've seen a lot of sites report this but they clearly do not have reading comprehension because literally the next sentence is trainers who register this way will get the email for zarud on december 11th so i'm very excited for people to uh complain on november 20th why they haven't gotten zeroed even though i don't know where these people are reporting their news from but this is off pokemon's official website it's in the same paragraph you gotta sign up for the email on november 20th before november 20th and you will get your email for zarood on the 11th now if you do not know how to do that i did tweet the support link on twitter yesterday or when you're listening to this on friday of how to verify your email is on so go to my twitter scroll back until friday i tweeted like three times on friday it should be easy to find when you get those are rude it will be level 60 it will no leaf guard it will have the moves close combat power whip swagger snarl dark grass-type pokemon is the american press release so i know the question is what if i live in the uk what if i live in ireland what if i live somewhere else i do have that available here off cereby okay so us sign up for the newsletter check to see if if your pokemon stuff is going to spam if you're worried have your significant other have a friend have your mom sign up for the newsletter through the trainer club account if you're in the uk you can either do game which is their game stop equivalent you can walk into a game store if they're open or you can get go to the game online store in the near future i don't know what that means i've never been to a game but i assume it's like past distributions in ireland it will go through gamestop's website i don't know what that means gamestop at least in america has only been in store so i'm not 100 sure what that means in germany you have to go to gamestop in the store and you can do that now for our german listeners apparently it will be on gamestop online on december 1st in austria and switzerland gamestop in store now in the netherlands and belgium game mania you have to sign up on their website codes will be sent out every friday in france micro mania i have no clue these these game stores are out of control you have to sign up on their website to get a code and then in portugal you have to go to fnac stores no clue what that is uh no word on canada no word on australia i'm so sorry to you all [Laughter] but that's that's everything cerebe has reported thus far but to be fair i think australia didn't get zera aura until like five months after the movie stopped showing so yeah i don't know about canada canada also is sometimes delayed i think canada's can sign up for the trainers club account if i'm not mistaken so do that i guess with the hopes but canada doesn't have gamestop they have eb games so i guess probably something with eb games in the near future these codes should be universal though so just like if you bought a movie ticket in japan you get the 16 to 12 16 digit code one of those numbers yeah and you should be able to redeem them what is stopping somebody in canada or australia signing up for the trainers club newsletter i don't think it asks for your location does it i don't think so i don't remember i i've been signed up for those things for so long yeah because they send out like one free free tcg code at like a month yeah also like people who had to sign up for the last time and they were like oh i have to sign up for it again why didn't you just leave it it's not hard to delete an email yeah like you know this is how they distribute things like just stay on the list can i can i as a us person go to game mania's website in the netherlands and just sign up on their website and get a code yeah yeah sure i mean i got google translate that's how it works right no because you're gonna get like the completely wrong thing how hard is dutch i don't know i don't know anything in dutch how do they hello an extra level ola that's spanish that's spanish well the glass is oof to taffle root is out no word on the shiny celebi which i think was a concern of some people's japan got chinese celebi doesn't they could do this at a later date give the shiny celebi one maybe it's for christmas they they could give the shiny celebi when the movie actually comes out right shiny celebi isn't in vivid voltage so if they're waiting to do two of them they could just not do shiny celebi that's very true um but they but they could do and probably will do a distribution when the movie actually comes out in the united states which we don't know when that is i still strongly believe it will be exclusive to netflix netflix has a bunch of money to spend speaking of canada not getting anything the pokemon center does now arrive to canada previously the limited us availability pokemon center offers a high variety of high range pokemon merchandise uh we are thrilled to announce pokemon center is coming to our fans in canada giving them an additional way to give us money oh sorry an additional way to express and celebrate their favorite pokemon fandom through premium merchandise says cindy ruppenthal the director of e-commerce for the pokemon center inter company international quote pokemon center has something for every type of trainer whether it's to play collect decorate or wear we look forward to seeing seeing even more trainers enjoy these offerings in celebration pokemon center customers in the us and canada will receive a tcg promo card featuring special delivery pikachu with no additional cost with any eligible purchases while supplies last oh look at this for those interested in what am i looking at oh sorry i'm reading it this is the last sentence in this press release for those interested in staying up to date on pokemon on upcoming pokemon center dot ca they can sign up for the email newsletter at club.pokemon.com us slash pokemon trainer club slash sign up i'm assuming canadian people will still get the newsletter like american people when specifically there's the us could stand for united states it could stand for the power of us but i would argue that it probably stands for us but they're telling canadian fans to sign up for club.pokemon so if you're in canada just sign up for the newsletter and hope that you get it look just sign up for everyone to sign up for the newsletter uh you're getting pokemon emails if you're listening to a podcast for two hours about us complain about pokemon go you can sign up for an email from the official pokemon company that would be the logic let me check the attic channel shout out to haley for the pokemon center coming to canada news the giant metapod thing we'll talk about that next week if we get that that can wait that can wait about thinking about it is that real it is real yeah it's not fake no no it's a giant 350 um it sold out case of i has doing another drop of pokemon stuff i believe that's available now you can do like the grookies the sabbles the score buddies you can get your name customized on it case if i cases are pretty expensive when it comes to iphone cases but they're pretty nice they're really nice quality they're a little bulky but yeah they're a little expensive but case if i is doing another pokemon drop i believe that's available now shout out to stuart for that wow more pikas already sold out grookie sold out dang it i do like their cases i just wish they were a little thinner they gotta be bulky for when you drop your phone though question of the week greg okay ready it's not my fault if your question don't get asked blames on spj it's the question of the week baby i have no clue what that song was ah do aleppa right nope name that tune uh oh uh it's juice juice yeah that's not the artist it's the word in the song yep you're burning you're burning candle here yeah i don't listen to enough pop music too i need new jersey chris to be my uh what is it dial a friend your phone a friend this is from pat says if you could remove one feature that you dislike from main series or spin-off franchise what would you remove pay to [Laughter] win i mean steve's gonna say all the different stones dang how did you know because that's all you ever complain about there's too many they've gotten rid of so many things that i've hated already like hms and breeding was terrible i mean i want them to bring back barry planting hey they didn't say bring back they said remove i know i'm trying to think of what to get rid of well what do you will's pay to win anything else no i honestly uh i think marks [Laughter] marks and ribbons get rid of them yep no i mean ribbons whatever nobody ever cared about ribbons but it's basically like i was discussing this with texas chris everybody's named chris these days but um marks are basically there now because shinies are too available and it's like we have to have something that's exclusive to keep the obsessive people in here trying to get the fancy stuff [Laughter] and i'm like you know what it's just like every time i get there you you make it that one more level more difficult and i'm i'm not i mean you can just ignore marx like to like just ignore shinies too and yet that seems impossible to do i was going to say pokey jobs but i just ignore poke jobs yeah they're really bad they're not great and then polka jobs just want me to bring pelico back because polygon was good yeah and you can plant berries there too many items i don't think there's too many items steve does they really i mean you know i would like to see a lot of the work that i do is like increasing efficiency by consolidating duplicative things and it's like do we need dna splicers reigns yeah like can we just get like this is the change the mode item that's all you need i mean that's steve's thing though i mean i don't disagree that there are too many key items for for mode changes yeah um what would i remove what would i remove anything i want to remove i want to replace like i would be like the bike because i want pokemon riding back yeah i mean i'd like i want i i'm not a huge fan of the bike it's fine i'm not thrilled about it but i don't hate it enough to remove it but i would prefer it to be like in sun and moon because that was fun although calling 18 different things was a little annoying it is nice that it's all in one they got rid of hms was the greatest things they ever did yeah i mean i could get rid of this sort of i could get rid i i don't like that there's tms and tr's um like you get so many tr's that it makes it almost pointless it's like i don't know if that's what they had planned on doing yeah but like that that didn't really add anything to the game i have you know 300 that's just another thing to collect yeah it's just another thing that racks up and you only ever use it on one or two so it it that division like i thought it was cool when i got i'm like oh cool and then eventually i realized oh i just have so many of these things that in essence they are all tms because i have so many of them and there's so few times that you're going to use one that's very specific that you're going to pop it on to one and the ones that are very common are already tms i think they should get rid of the move forgetter in the move remember because it makes it too easy for people get it right the first time or start over let's start over uh the only thing i think like repel doesn't do anything anymore yeah repel can go republican chairman rose get rid of chairman rose that was like i i would actually rather see do you know how they do the comic where it's like garfield without garfield yeah i want to just see the whole game where like chairman rose is an imaginary creature that everybody talks about but nobody ever sees but he's not actually there uh i got it i'm into that remake remove quick ball well then you have to remove timer ball nah timer was fine no they're pears not quick balls ugly no that yeah they come what have you ever caught a zapdos in a quick ball that's a match made in heaven no well that's why you fail yeah i mean like even even the beginning of the game like they don't even show you a catch tutorial if you catch a pokemon they've done pretty good over the years they've gotten they've gotten pretty good at streamlining a lot of the super annoying things i'm sure like 3am i'll wake up like no remove remove all of mystery dungeon the franchise oh come on now just because you don't enjoy it doesn't mean it's bad it's fine it's like cute but yeah it's like very hard for it to keep my interest we did another pokemon conquest that's what we need the game was pretty good except for the ending man they really grinded it out at the end there yeah they need a new pokemon shuffle we do and a new pokemon ranger let's not pay to win pokemon ranger oh the problem is we just don't have the styler anymore i know but it's a touch screen that's about pokemon ranger on the mobile oh that yeah that i'm into make that happen we'll give us our uh pokemon of the week well this is a mess because man i was so deeply asleep when you guys texted me but here last week's pokemon all right it was a poem uh here we go with the poem short enough i'll just read it thin and supple floating in the wind are you origami not the lawnmower not electric that is your brother your brother falsely named a tree you are the grass one not a pokemon but are you anything but beastly if you were you'd be the seed the thorn not the drawn sword all right i couldn't have made that easier for you folks come on it's [Music] proceed how so close and i yet you misinterpreted the last line of the poem completely it's cortana cortana correct whose shovel icon is incredible oh i mean cortana is just a great looking pokemon i love the design although you know i steve were you using one in battles yeah i was not i did not like it in sword and shield when i was watching it on screen i have to see it on my own but i was not impressed was it so tiny i think it was just it was moving weirder than i thought oh it kind of like floats as if it's made of paper it's not it's like solid yeah there's something off-putting about it i don't remember it's got the highest attack side of all grass types and steel types it's true because it's an ultra beast is that all the trivias there's some trivia here uh it is um in pokemon sun and moon cortana has a base catch rate of 255 which is the same as a pidgey due to a beast ball having a five times catch rate modifier that means one will never fail trying to catch a cortana in sun and moon despite being called ub slash in japanese kartana cannot learn the move slash and the anime cartana does speak the human language but in reverse i don't know if you guys have seen clips of that nope i have if you play it backwards it it's in english and it usually it's like usually them saying like i love to cut or like i need to cut this well that's the stuff at nightmares right there uh carton is cool i like cartrona quite a bit i like it a lot too it's uh of the ultra beast that i have disturbingly following me in the crown tundra it is my favorite all right this week's pokemon of the week it's a real short one it's a real easy one greg's already got it right uh here we go i was hardcore napping and completely missed the text messages from steve and greg letting me know that recording was starting so i did not have a lot of time to repair this week's pokemon in podcast lore this is the pokemon that greg defeated with a level 100 roselia i think it has a primal form and has been featured as the box art for two games this is the worst pokemon of the week ever it's obviously chat oh yes yes all right i mean i can't can't knock them all out of the ballpark folks that's our episode if you made it through so sorry like i shouldn't apologize people are always like i love the two hours there's nothing to apologize for uh i am going to
