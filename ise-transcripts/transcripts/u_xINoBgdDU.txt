are happening than the 25th anniversary so we're just going to switch this to an all pride event because i got a lot of news i could cover we got kiss for pokemon oh boy now we go kylie minogue released a cover of a lady gaga song and the gays have gone wild it sounds like like like making a a gourmet twinkie you don't you don't need it no nobody nobody ever saw it nobody wanted it you're happy that you have it now that you have it you know i don't know you need to have music no it does not touch my heart sorry will is here i see kylie minogue i i thought she died actually so i'm surprised she's still putting out albums congrats isn't she like 400 years old she's 50. what did she like recorded on top of lady gaga's grave you know i'm 52. you're attacking me and you're like three years behind i'm only two years behind you number one you're only 50. unless you've been lying about your eight oh 51 that's right that's right we round down until you cross over the fives and pop stars are like presidents being in the position ages you at about six times the normal human rate except they have all the access to all the mysterious moisturizers and the secret formulas that we can't get we normals can't get it get our hands on just because we can't afford them uh if you're watching the youtube version i clearly missed the memo on what to wear today no no no you got the memo and you rejected the memory and you rejected it soundly you said nah hoodie my brand me hoodie forever hoodie life i have soundly rejected all hoodies oh dear oh hoodies am i i'm sorry i'm i'm the one that's in the middle yeah yeah yeah you're ac dc well because this year is the 25th anniversary we are just littered with news news left and right um you know probably a shorter show here because there is no news and e3 is in like two days for nintendo so um two things always two things uh number one is we'll be doing a bonus e3 show in collaboration with discord uh discord reached out they wanted uh me to do some stage stuff because they launched their stage feature which is like a competitor to clubhouse um so we'll be doing a bonus live podcast on discord stage discovery thing i don't know what the full name is with this discovery thing i think stage discovery is the the discovery part of the stage part so we'll be doing that at 7 pm you're a real great partner for this product sir yeah well we got two more to do per the contract um so we'll be doing that 7 p.m central time on our discord which is free you can just pretty much it's just a live podcast you join it you listen if we have time at the end we'll take some questions uh and we'll just talk about the news we're quoted must do a minimum hour uh but it'll be fun yeah should be fine we can burn through an hour real quick so we'll be making up news is there something that we will be watching beforehand do i need how much prep work is required here uh well the nintendo direct is 40 minutes at what time i think it's one central oh okay i can do that at lunch i mean you can skip all the useless games like the salt pyramid game and the what's the salt pyramid game you don't remember that from the last direct you're making stuff up what i no it was called like emerging salt or something you're gonna emerge my salt unless you actually describe something that's real that is real um remember this well i'm gonna just type a nintendo salt game and see what happens i'm sure something will come up it's like called salt triangle or the triage of salt rpg that i actually was interested in was that called salt it was a working title oh well nothing comes up you can skip the like 36 minutes of smash brothers news i'm sure they'll have somebody asked me on friday night why i don't play smash brothers and i said i don't like it [Laughter] that was it it's a it's a fine party game it is i mean as long as you don't have people who are super serious is super good i have never been in a group of four people where at least one of them was not excessively serious about super smash brothers that's you can't that's why you can't have more than two friends because that four that third one they're the smash brother fanatic yes you know will we all know amongst the three of us it's steve because i don't even know how to play smash brothers no i'm super bad at smash but you know what the buttons do yeah if you were to get pushed off the side of one of those platforms you would know what to do to get back onto the platform you would just i've never seen other people do it okay all right that's true i had a group of friends get mad at me because i didn't want to play smash brothers i mean you just in general get people angry at you well this was the same this was the same friend group that was like are you sure you knew what a brontosaurus was those are yours you are so grudging you have grudged on these folks just delete them from your phone just say just send the final text message i knew what the dinosaur was [Laughter] i knew it all the time i knew it all the time send all the links yeah no i'm not into spanish sp what i am into transition is pokemon merchandise and there is pokemon merchandise to talk about can we talk about the three 600 pens they put up on pokemon center that all sold out in 24 hours you have to be kidding what so they put up a a i am not exaggerating they were 5.99 not 5.99.00 they put it on looking at them right now they are super super super super super cute they put up a charizard a pikachu and a rayquaza pen the charizard and pikachu pen sold out within about an hour of being available and the rayquaza pen took about 24 hours so for judging popularity charizard is clearly way more popular than rayquaza didn't we know that yeah i think we all knew that i mean poor raymond quasar gets no love he gets i think there was a limit on these pens i think there was only a hundred of each yeah yes unique serial number and they're numbered and engraved with their number they're they're made by pilot which is one of the better japanese fountain pen producers and they are fountain pens which i am a fan of fountain pens not a collector because i don't have that much money um i'm a fan in theory i always think i'm going to like them but then i don't like using them oh i like using them i used to actually use them for work all the time um but they do require care maintenance and upkeep yeah they do and and i'm lazy yes give me the old pilot g2 and we'll be on our way the g2 is a great pen i don't is what size point is that if it's anything bigger than micro you've lost me this one right here the pilot g2 probably the best what size does it write with that's looking like it has a 10 at the end is that that's not no you've got micro you've got fine you've got whatever regular i don't know what they call it i'd because i only buy mike i call it smooth no so what is what is this brand pilot is the pilot g2 i am looking it up oh you guys don't know the pilot g2 oh okay well okay it comes in ultra fine extra fine fine and bold points so what did you get did you get ultra fine did you get fine whatever the standard is at target where's the box you got to look at the box now i gotta go to target is a 399 pen no one's keeping the box for this not with that attitude so i did look up the i did go to pilot's website you can find pretty much the same exact pen on pilot's website just without the engraving for about 600 so i don't think there was i i don't think uh although i am not a pen expert i am sure there is probably at least one person listening to this podcast that probably owns two one thousand dollar pens and this is their moment to shine uh but it doesn't look like this pen was any different than what pilot was already making just add the charizard engraving well i mean because because they already make a fine pen why would they need to i'm going to declare that you have fine point okay except it sounds fine i prefer micro but i will yes that's acceptable i mean the i guess the debate would be the same the similar pen is 400 on pilot and they slapped a pikachu on it and they're charging 200 more but that doesn't seem to be the case that's called the pokemon tax i mean engraving isn't cheap with that level of skill they got the they got the people in the back room scratching it out do you think you've made it in this world and you're fine money wise if you're buying 600 pens yes i mean only 600 yes yeah there are pens that go quite a bit more than 600 if i mean you could be living paycheck to paycheck but still haven't pen obsession i'm sure there are people who live paycheck to paycheck who drive very fancy cars and they just put all that money into their car and i think it shows your true true love of pokemon if you're going to drop 600 on a pen that you have to take care of like it's a child you can be one of those people though that never use the pen you buy the 600 pen you put it on the bookshelf number one they sell cases for fountain pens display cases but i will say i have honestly never met a pen enthusiast who does not find a way to use their pen yeah yeah you got to get that smooth you know you have a pen enthusiast in your life when you start receiving monthly postcards well there are like the car enthusiasts that buy a car or power kid in the garage and they never drive it okay jay leno i'm pretty sure is dead oh death on this episode well i mean we got either 25th anniversary or okay pick one or the other 25th anniversary isn't holding up i got a list of dead celebrities basically kids they're all dead spoiler boarding sorry the the pokemon center put up the chilling rains we talked about this last week the elite trainer box chilling rains they were up last week they were still up they just recently sold out i think that's a really good sign for either one they figured out how to prevent scalpers from buying a bunch of these or number two scalpers or stop slowly stopping to care about pokemon cards because brand new set exclusively trainer box on pokemon center.com sat there for over a week it's pretty easy to pre-order so yeah yeah i did they're sold out now but speaking of pre-orders some co it only took them six months they figured out how to do pre-orders correctly here uh they put up series three of the bear walker skateboards i know will has a series two somewhere in that house yes correct it's uh actually over my fireplace on the mantel hanging on the wall i haven't taken it out of the box several steps down the line that i have not achieved interesting pokemon choices here so these bear walker skateboards as of this recording are still available for pre-order they've been available for the last three days i think which is different than the other bear walkers which sold out within two hours yep um they decided to do a pancham a snomm and a puke mew man that hand sham is legit yeah i want to say nam so much the panchayat is super cute but i feel like they missed an opportunity to do snom pukamuku and pinkerton like wouldn't that be the three you do together no no is pink urchin a pokemon i did it on purpose just to get that sigh yes i mean they pinch hurricane is electric so it doesn't fit the grass fire pink theme water snow theme well this is what ice water fighting what you're trying to there's no pattern here you have a bear and two sluggy things do not call my sweet snomed it's not a slug it's a it's a larvae it's more like a maggot i always love when they do non-traditional pokemon like the default here would be like grooky sable score bunny or um i don't know leafeon glaceon sylveon pancham is like okay people like panjam champion jam snom is probably one of the most popular pokemon from gen 8 and then there's pika pika pikamuku gives pikamuku has raised in popularity since pokemon snaps yeah i wonder if this had something to do with it probably i mean you you love to talk about the unified marketing universe of pokemon timelines and and how everything can sync up and hit right the unified uh cinematic merchandise universe of pokemon that's the name of my website the universal cinematic pokemon merchandise the pokemon tcumcu uh so they this is how pre-orders work though you don't you don't say that a skateboard's for pre-order and then it sells out an hour you put up the pre-orders you see how many people want the skateboards and then you sell the skateboards to them yeah but see now that's different because uh pre-orders of things like amiibo which are not numbered and limited edition yes you want to pre-order find out how many people want and then you make as many as people these skateboards are supposed to be numbered limited edition not make to order so look bear walker ain't having he doesn't have anything else to do but what are you talking about what else is bear walker doing non-pokemon skateboards walking being a bear being a bear hanging out at the eagle getting the picnic baskets going to the eagle a bear walker has got a lot happening also i would like to point out uh somebody on this call often gets their pre-orders canceled yeah i i had my amazon pre-order canceled for my battle styles i ordered 16 months ago it's fine i got enough battle styles my barnes noble is always stocked battle style's easy to find these skateboards look good i i finally ordered one well now i know which one you ordered because you gave a clue in your instagram unless you completely lied um i think my instagram was only to share the news uh this is just a thing anybody who wants to pre-order the snom skateboard for me uh hit me up on twitter i will give you uh where put it on your uh amazon wishlist dude pre-order it it doesn't charge you to chips if there's anything i've learned from only fans it's put stuff on your amazon wishlist [Laughter] okay um greg you got to get the you got to get the decorative skateboard so then it brings you one step closer to a real skateboard to the edge and i'm about to break you realize that i skateboarded as a child and i didn't enjoy it then greg we could go to third eye together you get a skateboard i get a tank top greg there's an axe across the street from my house we could go together i will pick out the perfect board for you it's a long board okay can he get a long board yeah yeah yeah yeah i think i want to get that longboard is this going to be a skatey infinity thing because then i'm really into it because i just finished that i can introduce you to some folks in the minneapolis skate scene all right i'm in i'm in to skate the infinity also i'm not paying 250 dollars to hang a snom skateboard on my wall not with that attitude i am not that much of a bro money's not that good in the bank or something think of the think of the 20-year value that skateboard will accumulate especially if it's paired with an ancient mew well i have ancient mute locked in the vault so don't even start but yeah if there is a rosalia skateboard you know that i will be hard-pressed to not buy that skateboard are you listening mr walker well we don't mr bear we don't know if mr bear walker is is is moving on to series four maybe this is his last hurrah that's like pre-orders are you know how much money this is making him how many drinks that buys at the eagle like two but still uh pokemon center also restocked the sought after lapras float and they introduced a bunch of new float floaties is that the plural i think they smell like loading devices rafts rafts i mean it's a shape it's an inner tube they did a pikachu one and a psyduck one in the standard ring and then the they also did a brand new snorlax and a whalelord uh which are very large small uh but no one cares about snorlax and whaler the lapras is sold out and gone gen wonders poor waylord living his best life i need a pool okay i need a pool so that i have a reason to purchase these steps one you have a backyard i know you don't have to purchase a pool is that a pool there just start digging a hole and then fill it with cement and then fill it with water no you do with the above ground pool you don't do the below ground in the ground no you gotta ain't fancy how are you gonna show the pen people off if you don't have an in-ground pool pen people don't care about pools they don't look up from their writing to notice that i have a pool exactly what i need is that people to see me from an aerial shot lounging on my snorlax pool float in my pool you don't even live close enough to the airport to make it worth it don't waste your money on a pool i'm not plus did we outdoor pools of minnesota are a two month experience i mean honestly greg you could get the floatie and go to one of our many beaches which is a i don't understand how those two words go together because lakes are made of mud and beaches are made of sand but somehow out here in the middle of the country they've made it happen yeah you'll be talking to town we are crazy roll up with that wailord the raft yeah they know i they know what's coming way lord in a tank top and you're good to go i mean the art park has a place that people can swim in so we could go to the art park with our snorlax floaties and just take over yes did we talk about the slow poke last week the giant snow poke yeah i think we were mainly focused on uh yamper booty and i think we mentioned that there was a giant slow poke but definitely we can talk about the giant 59-inch slowpoke oh yeah we didn't talk about slowpoke merchandise we did talk about the slowpoke event because once again in the coalescing universe of cross promotional you know slowpoke is now appearing everywhere in the pokemon world it's part of the pokemon cinematic universe merchandise i have a problem with the slowpoke plush it isn't the price although it is 450 dollars and still available for pre-order gravy what problem could you have the problem is they say that it's inside they say it's life-size right am i am i missing this where oh no they don't say it's life-size yeah yeah they say jumbo take it slow with the jumbo plush where'd you because when when the lady is holding said yeah we we did talk about this yeah when the when the lady is holding said slowpoke plush it's it's significantly bigger than her and i've never imagined slowpoke being bigger than a person i expect slowpoke to be like maybe like two cats big what that's just wrong maybe three cats all right how big your cat is what's the official slowpoke size yeah i'm looking that up right now i'm going to the sources because this slow poke is 26 inches tall freedom units and 59 inches long it says it's based on slowpoke's measurements in the official pokedex slowpoke is 311. yeah so it's actually shorter than the actual slowpoke because three feet is 36 inches yeah it's 311 it's all mixed up it doesn't know what to do unless oh good gracious greg i am about to walk off this program everyone in that band is dead [Music] man i used to listen to that for no good reason i still have one gracious they did one uh lady gaga cover and that was oh a 311 lady gaga cover for pride i'm here for it but slowpoke is 311 so this slowpoke is longer here's the issue with the concept of a slowpoke height okay is it from tummy to back because slowpoke is always just lounging around or is it from tail to head because you know a slow bro and a slow king can stand up well you can't count the tail because it can be pulled off so the tape grows succulent yeah but that's a variable that you can't count in the okay so is it from feet to top this plush would only be worth 450 dollars if you could chop the tail off and it grew back tail was removable it should be attached with velcro and you go and then give it to your dog and then you get a replacement sent to you it makes an eye-catching decoration in any room or office steve it could be on top of that large meowth right now if he puts one more thing in that office the office is gonna explode just think about it you can have a giant slow poke behind you with your bts toilet paper on the back of the slowpoke you don't know that's true of 30 rolls of bts toilet paper i've thought about this i look i have thought feel sealed still sealed still sealed it's it's only going up in value every day i have thought about said slowpoke but the problem with these plushes as i learned from the gigantomax meowth i have and i was like wow what a great purchase i can make tick tocks with this i can make youtube videos i can do a lot with this thing that's behind me but what they don't tell you prior to you ordering it and before it arrives to you is that it just minimizes the amount of space you have in your house if you want to make any rooms yes reduces yeah if you want to make any room smaller you have it why isn't it in your bed as a body pillow it's main function to hug it and comfort it all night bed is already taken up by real cats real cats look at a bigger bed get your you get your uh alaskan king bed no i wanted a california king first of all i mean i have a california king but now that you have this giant mouth you're gonna have to bump it up to alaska no i don't that's too big look at the size of the slowpoke and look at the size of the mouth and tell me you don't need that size of a bed okay even even if i had an alaskan king and i already was it was full of plushes there's no such thing as an alaskan king i think there there's a size bigger than california king no there is yeah it's called custom-made it might be like an alabama king or something no i think there's something bigger i reject all this an alaskan king bed measures 108 inches by 108 inches 9 feet by 9 feet and is the largest mattress available this is made up it's not real this is from a thing that says what's a wyoming king an alaskan king and a texas king now now now now ought to all of them now but okay maybe i don't know how to store plushes maybe this is my downfall because how are other people storing their meowth where are they putting it you find a closet you put it in the closet you hang it up in the closet and so that when people open it up there's a meowth in there what a pleasant surprise that everyone's looking forward to like my square footage in my house just keeps going down and down because of these brushes correct get a vacuum sealed bag i could have got half a pen for the cost of meowth and i would have gotten more of my office back and something to write with you wouldn't have to be destroying the environment by perpetually investing in these pilot g2s that you dispose of once the ink runs out you could have a nice fountain pen that you just slurp up the ink into a re-fillable glass inkwell like that sentence slurpee i'm i i am a master of the english language and several others and yes [Music] we need to take a break to do what deal with your with your mouth issue or to order this incredible wonderful slowpoke plush that would look great with a bunch of bts toilet paper on it at this point when i hopefully eventually move to minnesota i'm gonna have to get a separate u-haul for meowth yes yes slowpoke at this point meowth will just drive on there buy the airplane ticket and just have it fly it's like what a 20 minute flight yeah only like a 200 ticket i'm sure then then you're even closer to the amount of the pen all right we'll be right back [Music] did you see the [Music] yes [Music] dynamics [Music] and we are back from our break before we get into the rest of the news we have yes can we get can we pour one out for pokemon snap oh did that die too why no one seems to care anymore that and post milan what did you expect the game came out what a month ago uh yeah like five weeks ago it's a single player game that everybody talked about posted all their pictures played 60 hours in 60 hours is like less than two work weeks for business all these people are like pokemon snap is dead it was a good game everybody loved it it lived its life what do you know what do you want no i mean it was fine it was good it was just that i told you a lot i'm still stuck on meganium a better game came out that's the life cycle of these things i abandoned animal crossing for sword and shield i abandoned pokemon snap for the bar superior metopia i definitely enjoyed my time with pokemon snap i mean i streamed it for like three weeks yep and that third week i was streaming it it just didn't seem like people cared anymore even though i wasn't even close to being done with the game i mean i finished my pokedex i got all the hundred and how many pokemon 214 pokemon 14 yeah i finished that i didn't get to go back and do four stars on every picture but i probably would have needed 200 to 300 more i didn't get all the titles did they did somebody from your stream come and steal your copy of the game no i just things happen i moved on to different games but also i'm not going to stream a game that you know people don't seem super interested in i can understand that yeah i think there's like a i think there's a conversation that i probably don't want to have today about how like going back to our original talks like five weeks ago about how people wanted shinies and people wanted dlc i don't think any of that would have extended the game but besides maybe people playing an extra day or two well no but that's what happens with dlc and stuff i mean i give it an extra week more than an extra day or two yeah but i mean i mean so compare this to like sword and shield to get through this the base story of sword and shield is a 30 hour experience and then a lot of people stop yeah so i think the post game is both there for sword and shield and snap right like you can shiny huh you can go to the battle tower you can breed you can collect all the items i do think they did like there's no disservice or hard feelings i have for pokemon snap i think their post game of finish the pokedex get all the pictures upload to leaderboard i think it was all great yeah i just don't know how maybe it doesn't matter i just don't know how they get people to i think they were close to getting people to come back to it every day i think if the leaderboard refreshed in a better way instead of like once that thursday night hit which is when the leaderboard refreshed whoever they grabbed for like top photos they would stay top photos for the week um and then it kind of did a bad job at refreshing photos to show to you i feel like they were so close to and that's the problem not a problem but that's like the struggle that a lot of games have is how do we get our players to come back every day but also we need to make sure that we're not confusing the concept of mobile gaming which is we need continue just mobile anything at this point like we need continuous engagement from players over all time unending they must come and touch us at least once a day versus the console based gaming experience which is a game can be successful if people play it all the way through enjoy it and put it away i have not played the legend of zelda the original legend of zelda in many many years it's still a really good game i i think it's fine that i i think snap had a longer life than people expected yeah but there's no real collection like you aren't looking for something to add to your collection it's not like sword and shield where you have these things that you're going to be able to put them in home that you're you're able to shiny hunt that you're able to to use on teams that you're able to trade to other people it has sort of a built-in endpoint get all the pictures see all the cool scenes and that's fine for a game it's not it wasn't built to be a forever game it was built to be a beautiful experience which it was and then you're like cool and if dlc came out it would be super popular and people like yeah i'll go visit that again for a week i really liked it it it just have been a game that people got a lot of fun out of and then ended it's not an animal crossing but we've also uncovered a very deep fail in the coalescing expanded pokemon universe intersectionality in that by releasing the lapras floaty before the predetermined end-of-time life of pokemon snap and the skateboards everybody is like running to be outdoors and it's like you can't you either floating down the river in your lapras floaty or you're sitting in front of the tv playing pokemon snap but you can't do both so hey those nintendo commercials told me that i take my switch to a rooftop there's other people with the rooftop is not not floaty too i can take my switch on that lapras floaty i just gotta make sure i don't drop it in the water no you have to be in that rare that very small wedge percentage of humanity that number one has an accessible rooftop that you can go out and sit upon number two has a floaty kiddie pool which i know you do because i saw you open it on your stream you've got the pokemon kiddie pool that you can then fill with water and put a lapras floaty into i think the lapras is bigger than the i'm almost positive that's called planning uh i mean do you think developers do you think bandai namco namco bandai do you think they know that like we're releasing this game they think it's solid i thought it was solid i thought it was a very good game do you think they're like this game is going to come and go yeah uh i'm sure they think this is how much money this game is going yeah yeah period it could be a five minute game but if it tracks out to 50 billion dollars it's getting made it is a success yeah i mean i think they counted as a success it sold well didn't it yeah i i think it is yeah i don't i doubt it wasn't i mean i think they were like yeah this is a single person set established game and you'll play it and you'll get what you get out of it it will sell really well and and done not only did it sell really well it got really good reviews yeah hey this is what better review can you ask for that this is better than i was expecting i mean i'm happy with this for the two weeks that it was in the public conscience it was everybody was talking about it and everybody loved it i don't think they can get a better proof to the pokemon company that they did a really good game i don't think they needed to make the game more than they did and i don't think it needed to last longer than it did i mean it is an experienced game and you had a great experience with it i did i really like that game a lot and people's i mean to capture people's attention for two weeks is not a small feat these days that is a long chunk of time true for a game to have captured a huge swath of people for for a a big part of their of their ramp up to summer i agree i just want i just want to talk about pokemon snap i just like that game a lot so i'm not going to pour one out it had a wonderful life it still lives downstairs i may go back to it at some point when i'm done uh defeating the dark lord will in my mitopia game look i want nothing to do with your miitopias it's too late i have facebook reminding me every day of all the fun that i used to have with the one on your phone yep i was like the i was the last person to log in on the last day that that game was available what was that called mitomo mitomo yeah me tomorrow was fun and all you all abandoned me mm-hmm i'm so i'm done with your me playgrounds well this is why you're the villain in my game permission to put me in metopia that is my exclusive oh i know my likeness is worth money no it's not registered trademark this ball shaved head right here and tank top register trademark these guns you you can't you can't just reproduce these guns on the internet for free buddy i mean i did uh you'll be hearing from my lawyer okay uh speaking of lawyers lawyers that's this is the problem with the 25th anniversary is we haven't had yeah enough legal controversies we need we need more we haven't had anything we need milwaukee to do more looney tunes anti-pokemon go stuff so that we can have that to talk about this has nothing to do with lawyers uh they released the new gimmick for the tcg do you think i remember there was a time where people were like giganta max is dumb dynamaxx is dumb bring back megas these people know nothing about pokemon let me introduce you to the pokemon trading card game where gimmicks are even more dumb there was a mc before we get to this new gimmick that they showed off it's called the union by the way i saw this in my instagram story is this like legion and card fight vanguard because man that drove so many players away and they were just they were just mad about it we'll circle back to what v union is i need to lay the groundwork here when will and i got into the pokemon trading card game competitively it was around heart gold soul silver undaunted black and white black and white emerging black and white for me yeah and there were these cards called legend cards i owned them all and they were not good there were points in time throughout the competitive scene where they were maybe like b-tier at best they weren't like a decks they were like b decks and before anyone writes in and like i won with kyogre groudon i am sure there are very good players that were able to make these decks work for them there's a very specific situation where my friend kyle sukovich whose name is puka he was the best player in wisconsin and he won with like this vanilla vanilla victini deck at a like a battle roads and the only reason he won wasn't because this deck was like an a-tier deck he even admitted that it was just a fun deck he wanted to play but because he won the battle roads tons of people started building vanilla mctv because he won with it so i don't doubt people won with these legend cards but they were awful let me explain what they were do everyone listening to show knows what a full art card is it's it's a pokemon card usually the pokemon takes up the entire card the art is pretty good legend cards during heart gold soul silver were two cards that made up one card so for there was like cresselia darkrai uh like ryko suicune kyogre groudon uh rayquaza was just he they were on their own card and you just the top half was his head the bottom half was his butt the snakes have butts i guess so snakes yeah it's like a dragon he's a dragon dragon snake and dragons are just big snakes so like kyogre groudon legend so kyogre's on like the top part groudon's on the bottom and when you're playing the tcg you needed both of these cards in your hand at the same time in order to play it down on your bench uh and you can only play at the time you could only play two of each because they were considered one card so you could have two kyogres and two groudons but the bad thing is if you relied on this as your wind condition in your deck and both kyogres were in the prizes and you got two bottom half of groudon that you can't do anything with you're kind of you can't do anything with and specifically their moves were pretty expensive they were pretty hard to power up and normally the the reason why these don't do particularly well is because when you have a mechanic in the trading card game to quickly accelerate energy so let's say for example i'm trying to make this as easy as possible let's say you're running a water deck usually the the easiest way to run a water deck is to run like a blastoise and blastoise has an ability to normally like take energy from your hand and you can put as many on your pokemon as you want but blastoise is a stage two so you gotta have the squirtles you gotta have the rare candy you gotta have the war totals you gotta have the blastoise it takes sometimes it's hard to get blastoise up and running and so not only would you have to get blastoise up and running you got to try to figure out how to get kyogre groudon up and running because you got to get two of these cards in your hand at the same time and normally with like a blastoise kind of deck have one powerful ex or gx or v card because it's just simpler that way right instead of needing squirtle and rare candy and blastoise just run a keldio like caldeo is pretty all right it has good hp decent attack so that's like the dilemma these cards existed we are now in 2021 and the pokemon company said nah two cards not enough v union you you so how do you do you can you willingly discard things do you have to put them on a bench and hope they get knocked out yeah so so instead of the the legends you needed them in your hand and you play the two legends in your hand at the same time to your bench so the so you still need four union cards they need to go into your discard pile first once they go into your discard pile you can then put it on your bench there are ways to discard cards um although they got rid of ultra ball which is probably the people's favorite way of discarding it so ultra ball was discard two cards from your hand searching your deck for any pokemon um there's like usually like professor juniper or professors research which you discard your entire hand and draw seven cards um there are cards that let you discard but the there there are a couple problems here that i at least see although i would assume that the people making gimmicks in the pokemon trading card game i would assume that they play tested this and that they um i don't know yu-gi-oh has this kind of stuff they have like yeah zodia uh the only thing i remember from the curtains you've been hitting zodia in like 28 years you can still play exodia yeah as far as i know exodia is still out there the various pieces throughout the world and once you collect five of them you get exodia and exodia destroys the world and of course then you win then you win because the world is gone so the problem with this is that you can only run you can only run one v union card so there's there's three of them they showed greninja v union zashian v union v union so you can't have like two mewtwo v unions or a mewtwo and azashian you can only play one per your deck but what i said earlier the same thing that applies the legends applies here if left thigh of mewtwo is in your discard or as in your prizes and the other three are in your discard pile you still can't play mewtwo until you get that prize card because you're relying on all of those to be in your deck and not prized although there's there has been cards like gladion that can help you switch out your prizes um and these cards have four different moves and or abilities so for example uh greninja has four attacks and has an ability and its ability it has two abilities actually one ability is it can't be poisoned the other ability is at any point uh your opponent plays an item from um their hand you can just uh you prevent that from happening so that that would be like if they try to crushing hammer you they just can't um does it also have probing foot yeah it's got three abilities oh wait what yeah it does have three billies three abilities one attack right no the greninja has multiple attacks greninja has like water water colorless this attack is 180 to a bench three abilities and four attacks okay she's uh it's 300 hp kazashian's 320 hp it doesn't have any abilities it just has four attacks and the me too has one ability for attacks yeah it really went all out on that greninja card geez yeah um and is this this professor burnett is supposed to help this whole thing happen yeah i mean professor burnette would would be very good for like any deck so it's it's a weird concept because you can actually have all of the different v union pokemon in your deck no you can only have one no no no you can have you can have the union greninja you can have the unizasian there's no restriction on having multiple viewings but the thing is when you play v union greninja once from your discard to your bench that's the only time you can play it once it's knocked out you cannot play it again oh i see what you're saying the other there's also like i don't know how yu-gi-oh does this or there's like other card games i think that have four cards to do this but if you're like a new player to the game and you open up a booster pack like you're like i'm getting back into the pokemon card game here we go and you open up a booster pack and your friend gets like full art cynthia and you're like man that card is so cool and then you open your pack and you're like i got mewtwo's thigh it's just literally the card is just his leg and see and it's my favorite time of year because all of a sudden i start getting messages on facebook messenger and twitter and any other instagram and somebody will like literally send me a picture of mewtwo's thigh and say i just got this in the pack what is this so do we think they're actually going to put them in packs or is it just going to be the the specialty package you get the four reunion cards and you just have to buy that that blister pack to get that and they're not going to be how they do that for america because it seems weird to collect all four of these yeah oh it doesn't seem like a [ __ ] thing to collect no like like if you're buying booster packs and you're like i keep pulling yeah greninja's tongue i feel like it's it's a thing that you buy a specialty blister pack for and they have the worst two other card packs in the back that are still relevant yeah in japan they're coming in um 60 card decks that are like 15 bucks so you get you get the greninja union and then you get 56 other cards for like a pre-made deck i feel like that is the best way to do this and not have it in the pack but what do i know i just i feel like the tcg was getting so good at making the game a little bit quicker and a little bit more accessible and i mean this could just be a one-off a quick little thing that happens and then they're like that was fun we out yeah i mean they they came in with with the legend stuff real quick i mean all the legends was like one specific set i remember i think it was just he was just under i will say in some defense of the legends the first time you and i ever met in person either you or vinnie was playing ho-oh legend i think it was vinnie yeah okay or it might have been me i really like toto decks decks are pretty similar they're usually like play one of every energy and then revive ho-oh from the discard pile and attach the energy um i don't think it was me though i think i have played the ho'o legend but not great i like to try to give ho-oh some you know some freedom uh some pokemon go news here is there will be a free remote raid pass from break through research through all of june i don't know if we talked about that last week um also that ho a speaking of ho oh that was not meant to be a transition but ho-oh will be shadow formed from giovanni that will start thursday june 17th through wednesday september 1st if you complete the latest team rock go rocket special research you will get the super rocket radar which will let you track down giovanni which will let you get shadow ho oh and if you want not ho-oh you have until june 17th to do zapdos from giovanni i mean and you're gonna save your shadow ho oh and purify them so that you unlock their hearts so they're not tortured forever right and they're worth better if they're they don't they're mad and angry how is that better for their mental well-being this is about financial not about the actual pokemon itself and if i could sell a shadow ho-oh for more than i could sell a purified ho-oh you know where my dollar is gonna go yeah valid did you guys finish your slow poke event there was a slow poke event oh my gosh are you ready are you ready i'm ready i actually did it was probably the easiest one that they've done yeah and it had a cute shirt the cute shirt sold me uh also the fact that galerion slowpoke was in raids and there's one that popped like close to my house and i just did it and it was like i uh i guess i could evolve a slow bro and a slow king yeah i've not seen galerion slowpoke so it's only in raids or through special research right although there is a i mean i could leave right now because there's a slow bro down the street the gallerian one no they don't spawn a while yeah oh slow bro slow bro i thought you don't you have to evolve it isn't that what the sign is you have to evolve it which is kind of silly because if you just catch a wild slope bro it doesn't count i may not have enough slowpoke to oh yeah i do i just cleaned all these out what what up uh niantic also announced that the next two community days will be on july 3rd and august 15th uh they didn't say which pokemon they would be they should have just skipped we're doing go fest in july skip july community today you have a community day coming it's called go fest yeah it's fine what we don't even know what it is what is it what is the pokemon that's coming a dino i don't know it's going to be beniri well wasn't there that be do thing that's supposed to happen at the end of the month oh yeah the two we don't know for sure we just suspect that it's what we suspect there's no way it's not be doof has to be bedif is this today because i'm going to skip that thing no because they that that thing was like three days look greg yeah we don't we don't skip community days but we determine listen we determine a level of effort in business we call this l-o-e if it's a really good i i don't want to say gibble's a really good community day but whatever if steve's coming out we go we do the walk we effort if it's badoof community day you and i will meet up at a diner we'll sit at the table we'll eat a burger we'll poke at our screen yeah i'll we'll get an incense going we'll get a lure going and works for me the level of effort will be much lower balls in your cart pokemon go the the pokemon go kovid rewards are like slowly ending i think they only have like 20 some days left you can check in the app i don't know off the top of my head but i'd be curious what their be curious not like them renewing it but what is sticking around and what's not yeah like are they going to add the walking to gbl are they going to um 16 days left 20 hours so the special bonuses right now are you can open 1.5 as many gifts so i think you can open 30 instead of 12. i can't wait for that to go away i'm so tired of sitting there every morning and opening so many gifts let me hit my limit and free me from this despair no more walking for go battle league boosted damage for traders battling in remote raids twice the effectiveness of incense buddies will bring you items more often and i think there was that huge like upset where they got rid of the what was it half egg yeah and then there was like some other things um i don't know i think for i think the biggest thing here is probably the go battle league stuff i don't do go battle league but i would imagine those people would probably be very upset if they had to start walking um the other stuff i think the only thing i really care about is like the twice incense effectiveness like i think incense are in a really good place right now and because they cost money i feel like they were not worth the price you were paying yeah and i feel like they now are worth the price you are paying true agree i mean my pokemon go now that i'm permanently working from home my pokemon go everything will be suffered because i don't have easy walk routes anymore i like the winter months i'm not walking around my frigid neighborhood i don't have a downtown office where i can walk indoors and have a million stops by me it's time to get a north face jacket then you can walk in the cold no then you get a canada goose jacket yeah yeah for the cold but i'm also not doing that either because that what i'm gonna do with my hands let my hands freeze off use those bad touch gloves that are always bad that they don't save my hands or do i walk do i drive around like i did last december getting deforded like a creeper parking my car in people's neighborhoods and i get reported do what i do set your poke ball plus to auto capture uh with your zip tie wrapped around that look i got just as many shinies as you did so with a lot less uh finger friction little that's true but i wasn't aiming for shinies i was aiming for those excellent curves because you get the three times the xp who did what gotta get to 50. that's where the real game there is no real game at 50. this is the false i'm once again here to tell you play the game at your own pace do not buy into their false stereotypes i didn't tell people to rush i'm just saying i need to get to 50 i didn't say game gobbler oh i'm so sad snap is gone but i'm gonna gobble my way to 50 and go hey go is go is providing for me [Laughter] it's true question of the week greg all right one moment now's the time on the cast when i wonder what will be asked pulled from slack and yt it's the question of the wii this is from brian what is your favorite duel type combination that exists or has yet to exist well i would say if they're saying your favorite i would assume it would have to exist i mean i could have a favorite that doesn't exist yet like ice fire you'd be like oh man yeah i want a nice way of ice fire anticipating that day uh i mean a bunch of my favorite pokemon are grass poison but that's not my favorite type i think my favorite type is ground ice i like my gross slime yeah i love memos wine not grass poison i mean i i don't like poison as a type grass poison aka every grass pokemon in general yeah i mean if if if rosalia and rosarite could be grass fairy i would be a lot happier but they're not i don't like poison as the type i do like fairy dragon who is a fairy dragon mega altaria no no i i don't like altaria i just um i think it just does not hit the spot i mean i like grass fairy a lot but there's only like isn't it just whimsicott oh i do like whimsicott though i want rosarie to go to grass ferry you got ghost fairy which is mimikyu that's not so great i mean mimikyu is great yes maybe q is great i will i guess i will say that you got bug fairy and ribambi i mean i do but i don't like like robot there are so few bug types that i like it is not because of their bugs i like dark fairy snarl well impedimp let's not go further than that i love grim i love the grim love the snow do you like it more than electric fairy did any oh yeah oh yeah i like the deny i don't care about jenny's typing i just like to deny but i mean i like grim snarl i also like that grim sorrow is dark fairy oh schnatic is also grass fairy okay let's not talk about pokemon no one likes here hey what no one is liking shanatic i had shannatic on my team to take on the whole i don't want to start up this conversation again but the end of ultrasound ultra moon should notice was a carry maybe that's why you didn't like ultrasound ultramoon though i did like that game the reason i didn't like it was because of the motion controls so let's not go down that road again uh i will also put ice fairy in my list i do like ice fairy quite a bit what is ice fairy nine tails alolan form well okay i did get greg and alolan vulpix right yeah okay dark fairy for me dragon fairy um and uh steel dragon is pretty good that's gonna be your like uh duraladon and your dialga i think it was maybe your only two hmm yeah i don't know i don't like dual types i like it just give me give me one type give me my pure or my pure type i like a water fly ground flying there you go that's my fave oh so you like the landorus yeah that was a pretty good question honestly um the who the the creepy flying scorpion guys gligar gliegar oh god scorer vigar they're ground flying too i'm pretty sure aren't they i think so let me look they're not poison but they do a whole bunch of poison fun stuff yes gligar is ground flying why do you say glygar funny what do you mean you say gleegar cause i'm happy and i'm full of glee so don't judge thanks in this month of pride how dare you is gl does glass course stay ground flying or does it change oh it stays right yeah it stays uh that question was from our slack community from patreon uh we are also adding a youtube question so if you're watching this on youtube and you want a question for the next week next week you can comment on this youtube video uh we have a lot but we can only pick one so it's don't no don't take it personally there's just a lot of questions and the show is already too long um so yes uh i will we'll ask the we'll do this one and if we missed your question which we did because we're only picking one uh feel free to ask it next week or ask a different question or just be sad i don't know pick your pick your poison uh this is from pokeflows from youtube what are your guys's thoughts on future pokemon games having a dip difficulty option at the start of the game to make it harder or for more experienced players or to keep it easy for new or younger players for example easy normal hard dang i actually saw this question on the youtube and have a prepared response oh go really yeah it's called they did it before nobody cared they stopped doing it well they did it before but it was post game it was bad it was weird and it was badly implemented oh it was real bad because it was like in one of the games you could switch to easy mode in the other games you could switch to heart no no you could you could technically have them in both you had to exchange keys yeah your friends so like if you had okay let's just explain this real quick in pokemon black 2 and white 2 there was an easy normal and hard and if you played white 2 when you got to the end you got a key which you could send to another game as many games as you wanted and that would unlock the easy mode for that player and if you beat black too and you got the hard key so if greg played black and will played white and i was the new player they could send me both keys in my copy regardless of if i have white or black too and then when i start the game i would have easy normal and hard but it was dumb because of what i just laid out you had to get through the game and do it as somebody who has played through the hard mode of pokemon gym leaders all had one extra pokemon um the gym leaders were like four levels above what they normally were like i think charon who's the first gym leader in black 2 spoiler he's normally like i think he's normally level 10 and level 12 and then in hard mode he's like level 14 and level 16. um and normally they they're not only would the pokemon be higher levels is the pokemon would have like a slightly different moveset and then i think for charon he had a third pokemon instead of the two and that was kind of how the whole game went in i think and this is what i've always said i think this is the fundamental problem with pokemon is is as somebody who has played more than one pokemon game i understand the world of pokemon so by you giving the gym leader an extra pokemon and making them slightly harder all you're doing is you're telling me i need to spend more time knocking out audino before i battle that gym leader um i i get i think it would be depend on how they implement the various modes it could be fun but they'd have to implement it in a way that hard mode isn't just grind more right and that's what i felt yeah for black too is i just felt like i was grinding audino a little bit more i didn't feel like it was like much harder if hard mode had a cap like when you went into the gym if you went over the gym's level it said you cannot bring these pokemon into this gym like things like that that would actually make actually make it a hard mode something that you couldn't power through i could see that being implemented but if it's i mean what generally happens in turn-based games is hard mode is i'm just going to grind my levels above well yeah the answer to most everything in pokemon is grind more yeah and that's not that's not necessarily more fun well and i would say i think just looking at the history of video games where a long time ago almost every game you started out by saying i want easy normal hard murder me you know look at the starting menu for doom right doom came out in 94 95 something like that same time as pokemon but the the thing was the increasing intensity of those hard modes in those games was make the opponents have more health reduce the spawn of bullets don't allow the player to regen three relatively simple things to implement it's just like you hit those fields like you know x times the health of any opponent np or whatever thing that you have to defeat uh divide by four the number of health packs you'll find as pickups you know the number of bullets you'll find as pickups and you know no regen if you die you restart the level or restart the game turn it into a roguelike whatever but if you were to do that in pokemon it just it wouldn't it wouldn't make it any harder experience it would make it a better experience right because it's it's not like i have to think harder it's once again i have to grind more so because technically like there's an infinite supply of supply items you know yeah just as long as you're patient enough and willing to grind them out so like limiting the number of drops it doesn't doesn't exist i think my problem with this is like i get it they're they're like really hard rom or fan made games and they're like designed to be that way and they're designed to be very specific in the sense of like the person who made them curated the gym leader to cover their bases um and they end up being like very tedious um but on top of that the person is also usually doing some sort of nuzlocke where if their pokemon dies they or faints they don't use it anymore and if that if that one rule wasn't there those fan-made games wouldn't be as hard as they are right because you're thinking in a different way of like well if if he dies and then this steamrolls and then i have to go back and regrind but i can't have him die because i need him for the next gym leader like it that that one rule of like if my pokemon faints i can't use them again changes well so much of your thought process in a battle the other rule is you can only catch one thing on a route you are artificially limiting how many pokemon you have how many you can catch and if you can use them past so the difficulty comes in that you have a much smaller and less ideal sometimes pool of pokemon because it's the first one you get on the route and it could be a caterpie or it could be a low tad yeah not the one percent that rare spawn that might be better i mean there are ways to implement that in the game i think that is a mode a very small percentage of people would actually want to play and not be worth coding and making in the game uh here's the answer pokemon hard mode every gym leader every gym whitney's miltank no wait pokemon easy mode every gym every gym leader is a bug gym literally just bring geodude and you'll be fine against whitney's miltank um i think there is room for like a first time playing pokemon and a expert playing pokemon i think there's a hundred percent that that like that somewhere that fits of maybe you not necessarily speed up the game but maybe you don't have to teach these mechanics but they're i think if anything maybe not a hard mode but they're i feel like maybe there needs to be this is so hard because people learn differently yeah like an easy like there's i i still cannot imagine somebody who's never played a pokemon game it's their first pokemon game and you drop them in there's 400 pokemon there's all these moves what do these moves do what are these priority levels what resist what what type is super effective there is a lot to learn all these held items and evs ivs and almost all that stuff you can ignore like you can go through an entire pokemon game never hear the term evs ivs never care about nature never equip the held item and you can do it and i think that is so important for a person to experience but i do think there there could be a slightly hard more difficult mode more challenging mode where maybe you do have to have held items or at least equipped mystic water or at least equip charcoal or at least maybe um use a tm but that prevents like nothing is stopping a player from over leveling right uh unless you the the way you prevent that is you walk into like the battle tower you walk into a gym yeah if your pokemon's 15 it brings it down to 14 because that's fair but these are all things you can do yourself right like if you wanted the game to be harder so this is my the funny thing i always think of is when somebody goes a pokemon game is too easy and this is how they play they walk into a gym they battle the dude first dude they then leave the gym heal go back into the gym battle the second dude leave the gym heal go back into the gym battle the third dude leave heal and then they save in front of the gym leader after fully healed and they they start the game and then they complain that the game is too easy you made that conscious conscious choice to do that um like if you wanted the game to be harder if that's your complaint if it's too easy like i don't care i do that too because i just it's just tedious to not do it um but if i wanted to be challenged try going like try going through the gym without healing at all is it harder probably is it as hard as you want maybe not but that was your choice um and if you are battling a gym leader and you decide to use a potion and then use a potion and then you're like ah he only has like eight more of these hydro pumps left that's not true hydro pump only has five he only has three more of these hydroponics what if you use pp max or ppm um and you like there are so many things you can do as a player to control your experience and i think that's i think that's a great part of the pokemon games like you choose which pokemon you want you chose to pick dragon knight you could have chose dunsparce um you chose to use those potions you chose to go into the gym leader with six pokemon you could have went in with three if you wanted to be like the anime they have three you have three um you can even make it so easy if you wanted to like i would say most people maybe don't change their team a lot right they they get six pretty early on they usually keep with the six maybe they change one or two but i feel like it's very rare that a player gets to the elite four with like 30 different pokemon that they can pick from usually it's like six maybe eight or nine but like most people just gravitate towards a team and use that team through the whole game but no one is stopping you from walking into blaine with six water pokemon no one is stopping you from going into valerie with nothing but steel pokemon right like again those are choices you as a player can make and i think that's so great in a pokemon game that's not saying that there shouldn't be like hey look i've played like seven of these can we at least mix it up like i think that that would be valid um but i don't know if like them dedicating time to like this curated hard mode is is really worth it for the amount of players or even a curated easy mode because i i i think it's hard to define out amongst a large populace in a large way that people play what's easy what's average standard and what's hard like there are a lot of variables there that i just don't yeah i mean i i know that that's uh that's the thing that we need like i would i would use my wife as an example you know she's played through all of sun and moon all of x and y all of ultrasonic moon all of ruby and sapphire as a kid like she's played through quite a bit of pokemon games but she doesn't she doesn't know like i i would probably say hey what type is mega altaria she probably doesn't know right like she's not an expert i don't think she's ever equipped in held items or anything like that and i remember watching her go through sword and shield and she struggled with uh kabu kabu the fire type and she lost to him like three times in a row and i was like you realize that his pattern is just willow wisp attack willowis attack and once i pointed that out she beat him and she never lost another battle in that entire game she lost to kabu three times never lost another battle and she said yeah that game was pretty easy like what is defining hard like if you like who like at what point how many battles do you have to lose in a pokemon game to be like that was hard because i think like you getting stuck at one gym leader or what what some people did they got stuck at ultra necrozma yeah like that fight was hard or maybe challenging but was the game hard it was like oh no i just didn't have the right pokemon and i was just gonna try to brute force it and you know no big deal once i got past that everything else was fine like it's really hard to like at what point are you like oh kabu was too hard i'm done with the whole game like i don't know if that happens with a lot of people i mean yeah and when you're dealing with an all ages game like every every age group is going to have a different definition of easy and hard i think i think i i almost prefer it now where the difficulty comes in making your own rules and how you want to approach the game and having them focus on a much better experience uh one good experience for everybody at every level um i i i do think it's tough because it's like should this be so hand-holdy and it's like hand-holding is is in the eye above of the beholder and how much you're gonna take it like i was watching somebody play diamond and pearl again and i forgot diamond and pearl how incredibly long that opening whole thing is before you even get taught how to catch if you thought ultra sun ultra moon sun and moon had a like long opening whew i feel like you are forgetting about it i mean i had forgotten how bad diamond in pearl was for the whole beginning and i'm like was watching somebody play it and i'm like this is abysmal this is so frustratingly long like you have to go back and forth and back and forth before you get to actually do anything important in the game yeah it's just mind-boggling establish that story they really hit you hard with it up front so it's amazing how much nothing they say in the beginning too i mean because i think they tried to do tgtv right and i don't know what the adoption rate of people actually looking at tgtv was very little i don't play pokemon games to watch tv not with that dude it's a good question though like i think there is room for i've new to this game or i've played this game right well i think what it really fundamentally comes down to without doing a complete reconceptualization of what it means to be a pokemon game is you have to deal with what we call leatherman's law right leatherman's law is uh no the pokemon games have not gotten easier you just grew up just grew up right this is well established this is my number one law in the universe universities pokemon games didn't get worse you just grew up that like there's there's literally nothing that i think the pokemon company can do without deeply re-conceptualizing like re-conceptual like i forget it that's far too many battles i still have my retainer right so in order to increase the difficulty you have to make those choices yourself what do i want to do and how i approach this game to make it more of a difficult game for me and challenge myself i was visiting my friend this is my last point because i think i think this i think this goes that friend me no i was visiting my friend aaron you have too many friends more than more than two friends you're gonna start having smash brothers probably if you've listened to this podcast for 10 plus years aaron was on the show back in the day he was the main person that i was the one that i we woke up at 8am we went to gamestop we picked up heart gold soul silver we watched documentaries and we played all weekend what documentaries did you watch uh we know like uh the the fast food one the ken burns stuff baseball civil war yeah or civil war and pokemon the tried and true have you met her in chuckles whatever documentaries existed in 2010 that's what we were watching okay um super size me was probably one of them so he's been playing like he he he was like me same age grew up with red and blue played almost all of them maybe skipped ruby and sapphire was really excited to get back into hardcore soul silver we bought black and white on release day and i went to and he he skipped sun and moon he skipped ultra sun and moon he like bought x and y barely played it but sword and shield was like he's back when sword and shield came out he he got up to the right before the fairy gym um and then stopped playing right before opal and so when i visited him he was like oh you're here i should play pokemon um yeah i mean whatever man like if you're gonna play like i would love to watch you play pokemon like that's what always happens when i hang out with aaron too i don't hang out with aaron all that often so he he booted up pokemon because he was like i don't know where i left off and he was in the glimwood tangle and his team was like he had a gyarados he had like a hitmonlee or something he had his uh intellion or whatever no he had rilaboo he had like his team was appropriately leveled he had six of them uh he had like miracle seed and whatever like he had his health items and he's going through the forest and he like sees an impedemp for the first time and he like catches it and then moves on and he gets to a trainer and it's like a comfey and like a shanatic or something and he almost loses to this random trainer and he has all the right pokemon and he has the right moves and i'm just watching and he like tries to use crunch on like the comfe and it's not super effective and stuff and that that i think is always forgotten about people that ask these questions is man i want pokemon to be harder but like you know you know the answer to the puzzle and when you don't know the puzzle yet when you don't know the answer to the puzzle it's very hard like all he had to do was hit one of his other moves but he had no clue what type of pokemon this was which is an extra bit oh wait does it tell you effectiveness before it doesn't it doesn't until you until you've battled it once i think battled it once so he didn't know what was super effective he didn't know what was resisted and he kept hitting resi like he would switch he would be like he would like crunch it and be like oh that's not very effective and then he would switch to a different pokemon then he would like high jump kick it it's like oh that's also not very effective against the fair and like he was losing to this because they would like draining kiss and like just this random npc not even a gym leader took out five of his six pokemon because he just didn't know what they were weak to and i think that's that is why if you've ever played one pokemon game and you move on to a second one it is significantly easier because you start putting those pieces together and you can't unlearn that right um and that's the problem with like trying to make the game harder is that's why ultra necrozma is so was such a good fight for a lot of people because they didn't know what to do and then once once it was pointed out to them they're like oh yeah okay i just like yeah lead me me q toxic and then just like switch for five turns and it's dead like i mean which is also why i prefer to avoid spoilers right because i want any new pokemon to be new to me right even when i'm doing like a nuzlocke when i'm doing like a nuzlocke and i'm fighting a gym leader and somebody in chat is like oh by the way they have hyper beam like you've just made it significantly easier for me because now i know like this is like i'm trying to make it hard right but once you tell me their moves i can now play around that they can only have four moves right um anyways i just think that's like it's a very interesting conversation it is i i mean i i do think there are potential things they could do like to make it harder they could treat it more like you know the battle tower they could do those things i i don't know if that appeals to as big of an audiences as all the people who want it thinks it does i mean they i mean they know game freak knows how many i mean and it's probably not a lot we don't get to see those numbers um yeah battle tower is like whatever as well it's like fine yeah it's fine uh no battle subway pokemon of the week all right well it's been a week of huge disappointments i just i i can't believe uh i lay it all out for everybody on a platter and yet it's i don't know it's like the platter is in front of you and you walk over to the water fountain and then complain that you're hungry here okay i am available for consultation with with the club where available it's over it's over it's over you can reach me on twitter you can find me on slack i'm sometimes your discord your name is me mentioned several times it's true and especially after the previous week when we said no restrictions on how you find out this information kids go go right to greg if you need to so based on a sanrio character and then the key statement this week's pokemon is derived from that character you can figure it out if you rearrange the letters properly you have to remove the c and the d though and by c i mean like on the moon or around italy now boy that is just so packed with nutrition it's like omega-3 fatty acids from a fish uh for for our folks in our slack they got to read the printed copy where they could see that the word c was spelled s-e-a not the letter c um and for those maybe maybe we're learning something today but there are seas on the moon because the lava flows hardened lava flows that exist on the moon have all been given the names of seas except it's in latin so there's mari imbrium and mari tranquilly tatis and mari fakun di tati i can't pronounce these latin things but they're all maare mare means c in italian there's three seas around the italian peninsula the mari adriatica uh what's the other ones there uh mediterranean well mediterranean is not one of the three technically around the boot uh but yeah adriatic tiranian and ionian are the three around the peninsula but the word favorite yu-gi-oh character or c in italian is once again mari but here's the other trick slight thing you still could have gotten if you saw the word mari i think in front of you that sometimes in foreign languages like latin or italian if a word ends in a vowel and the next word starts in a vowel you take the vowel off the ending of the first word so you might say like mar adriatico anyways m-a-r was the part yes my favorite sanrio character is basmaru bad bat so if you take out m a r and d from batsmaru and you rearrange the letters what do you get hello kitty yeah no it's zubat the only correct answer is gudetama it's together i kind of wanted it to be together because i thought that was fun but it's zubin hmm where's the baby desperate for pokemon of the week we're relying on zubat now look zubat is my what easily one of my least favorite pokemon i like zubat i liked zubat 50 caves ago it increases the difficulty level in pokemon games much in the way that cicadas ensure their reproduction through massive amounts it's got a cute shuffle icon because it's just all teeths it's got a terrible shiny i'm sorry i do not like what no other pokemon is the same type combination as zubat and its evolve forms that's actually shocking gen 1 is littered with poison types and yet there you go zubat's evolutionary family has several similarities with wubat all members are called the bat pokemon excluding subat they live in caves or dark places they have no visible eyes uh at their respective uninvolved states furthermore members of both lines respect ris respectively fully evolve of their respective fully evolved forms evolved by friendship they both have similar shiny forms with green main bodies well that's like 90 percent of pokemon zubat and mubat have similar english names both rhyming with the prefix of bat as a suffix uh zubat can seem parallel to noibat they're both flying they both are bats they both have infiltrator as an ability they also share the same base stats with the same attack and special attack switched around it's almost like there was a reason for it to be matched up with this do you think maybe yes that's fine yeah zoo that's fine that's fine that's not great i mean the shiny crowbar is like golden it's not green yeah it's like pick as quick as quick as i can get out of zubat form the happier i am so for this coming week's pokemon as i obviously have previously cast pearls before swine here we go i am very disappointed in the class this week so like any eighth grade teacher i am going to retaliate by treating my students like a bunch of babies next week pokemon is the pokemon that comes after this week's pokemon it has two wings it has two eyes it has two legs it has four teeth its name starts with the letter g i'm excited for go lurk it's chat [Laughter] yellow kitty yellow kitty gudetama uh well thank you for listening thank you for making it to the end of the show
