anniversary we are just (2:50 - 2:55)
littered with news (2:52 - 2:55)
news left and right um (2:56 - 3:01)
you know probably a shorter show here (2:59 - 3:02)
because there is no (3:01 - 3:05)
news and e3 is in like two days for (3:02 - 3:06)
nintendo (3:05 - 3:09)
so um two things (3:06 - 3:11)
always two things uh number one is we'll (3:09 - 3:13)
be doing a bonus (3:11 - 3:16)
e3 show in collaboration with discord uh (3:13 - 3:18)
discord reached out they wanted (3:16 - 3:20)
uh me to do some stage stuff because (3:18 - 3:21)
they launched their stage feature which (3:20 - 3:23)
is like a competitor to clubhouse (3:21 - 3:26)
um so we'll be doing a bonus live (3:23 - 3:27)
podcast on discord (3:26 - 3:30)
stage discovery thing i don't know what (3:27 - 3:32)
the full name is with this (3:30 - 3:35)
discovery thing i think stage discovery (3:32 - 3:38)
is the (3:35 - 3:41)
the discovery part (3:38 - 3:43)
of the stage part so we'll be doing that (3:41 - 3:45)
at 7 pm you're a real great partner for (3:43 - 3:46)
this product sir (3:45 - 3:49)
yeah well we got two more to do per the (3:46 - 3:50)
contract (3:49 - 3:53)
um so we'll be doing that 7 (3:50 - 3:57)
p.m central time on our discord which is (3:53 - 3:57)
free (3:57 - 3:59)
you can just pretty much it's just a (3:57 - 4:01)
live podcast you join it you listen (3:59 - 4:03)
if we have time at the end we'll take (4:01 - 4:05)
some questions uh (4:03 - 4:07)
and we'll just talk about the news we're (4:05 - 4:09)
quoted must do a minimum (4:07 - 4:11)
hour uh but it'll be fun yeah should be (4:09 - 4:12)
fine (4:11 - 4:14)
we can burn through an hour real quick (4:12 - 4:16)
so we'll be making up news (4:14 - 4:17)
is there something that we will be (4:16 - 4:19)
watching beforehand do i need (4:17 - 4:23)
how much prep work is required here uh (4:19 - 4:24)
well the nintendo (4:23 - 4:29)
direct is 40 minutes at what time (4:24 - 4:32)
i think it's one central oh okay i can (4:29 - 4:34)
do that at lunch (4:32 - 4:34)
i mean you can skip all the useless (4:35 - 4:41)
games like the salt pyramid game and the (4:37 - 4:43)
what's the salt pyramid game you don't (4:41 - 4:44)
remember that from the last direct (4:43 - 4:45)
you're making stuff (4:44 - 4:49)
up what i no it was called like emerging (4:45 - 4:52)
salt or something (4:49 - 4:52)
you're gonna emerge my salt unless you (4:52 - 4:56)
actually describe something that's real (4:54 - 4:59)
that is real um remember this (4:56 - 5:01)
well i'm gonna just type a nintendo salt (4:59 - 5:02)
game and see what happens (5:01 - 5:04)
i'm sure something will come up it's (5:02 - 5:06)
like called salt triangle or (5:04 - 5:10)
the triage of salt (5:06 - 5:12)
rpg that i actually was interested in (5:10 - 5:14)
was that called salt (5:12 - 5:17)
it was a working title oh well nothing (5:14 - 5:19)
comes up (5:17 - 5:22)
you can skip the like 36 minutes of (5:19 - 5:23)
smash brothers news i'm sure they'll (5:22 - 5:25)
have (5:23 - 5:27)
somebody asked me on friday night why i (5:25 - 5:28)
don't play smash brothers (5:27 - 5:31)
and i said i don't like it (5:28 - 5:34)
[Laughter] (5:31 - 5:37)
that was it it's a it's a fine party (5:34 - 5:38)
game (5:37 - 5:41)
it is i mean as long as you don't have (5:38 - 5:42)
people who are super serious is super (5:41 - 5:43)
good (5:42 - 5:45)
i have never been in a group of four (5:43 - 5:46)
people (5:45 - 5:48)
where at least one of them was not (5:46 - 5:50)
excessively serious about (5:48 - 5:52)
super smash brothers that's you can't (5:50 - 5:54)
that's why you can't have more than two (5:52 - 5:54)
friends (5:54 - 5:57)
because that four that third one they're (5:54 - 5:59)
the smash brother fanatic (5:57 - 6:02)
yes you know will we all know (5:59 - 6:06)
amongst the three of us it's steve (6:02 - 6:07)
because i don't even know how to play (6:06 - 6:10)
smash brothers no i'm super bad at smash (6:07 - 6:13)
but you know what the buttons do yeah if (6:10 - 6:14)
you were to get pushed (6:13 - 6:15)
off the side of one of those platforms (6:14 - 6:17)
you would know what to do to get back (6:15 - 6:18)
onto the platform you would just i've (6:17 - 6:19)
never (6:18 - 6:21)
seen other people do it okay all right (6:19 - 6:23)
that's true (6:21 - 6:25)
i had a group of friends get mad at me (6:23 - 6:27)
because i didn't want to play smash (6:25 - 6:28)
brothers (6:27 - 6:30)
i mean you just in general get people (6:28 - 6:31)
angry at you (6:30 - 6:35)
well this was the same this was the same (6:31 - 6:38)
friend group that was like are you sure (6:35 - 6:41)
you knew what a brontosaurus was (6:38 - 6:45)
those are yours you are so grudging (6:41 - 6:48)
you have grudged on these folks (6:45 - 6:50)
just delete them from your phone just (6:48 - 6:52)
say just send the final text message i (6:50 - 6:54)
knew what the dinosaur was (6:52 - 6:57)
[Laughter] (6:54 - 7:00)
i knew it all the time i knew it all the (6:57 - 7:04)
time send all the links (7:00 - 7:06)
yeah no i'm not into spanish sp what i (7:04 - 7:07)
am into (7:06 - 7:13)
transition is pokemon merchandise (7:07 - 7:15)
and there is pokemon merchandise to talk (7:13 - 7:16)
about (7:15 - 7:19)
can we talk about the three 600 pens (7:16 - 7:21)
they put up on pokemon center that all (7:19 - 7:23)
sold out in 24 hours (7:21 - 7:26)
you have to be kidding (7:23 - 7:29)
what so they put up a a i am not (7:26 - 7:30)
exaggerating (7:29 - 7:36)
they were 5.99 not 5.99.00 (7:30 - 7:37)
they put it on looking at them right now (7:36 - 7:40)
they are super super super super super (7:37 - 7:40)
cute (7:40 - 7:43)
they put up a charizard a pikachu and a (7:40 - 7:44)
rayquaza (7:43 - 7:48)
pen the charizard and pikachu pen (7:44 - 7:50)
sold out within about an hour of being (7:48 - 7:51)
available (7:50 - 7:55)
and the rayquaza pen took about 24 hours (7:51 - 7:58)
so for judging popularity charizard is (7:55 - 8:01)
clearly way more popular than rayquaza (7:58 - 8:04)
didn't we know that yeah i think we all (8:01 - 8:05)
knew that (8:04 - 8:10)
i mean poor raymond quasar gets no love (8:05 - 8:12)
he gets i think there was a limit on (8:10 - 8:14)
these pens i think there was only a (8:12 - 8:15)
hundred of each (8:14 - 8:18)
yeah yes unique serial number and (8:15 - 8:19)
they're numbered and engraved with their (8:18 - 8:20)
number (8:19 - 8:22)
they're they're made by pilot which is (8:20 - 8:24)
one of the better (8:22 - 8:26)
japanese fountain pen producers and they (8:24 - 8:28)
are fountain pens which i (8:26 - 8:32)
am a fan of fountain pens (8:28 - 8:34)
not a collector because i don't have (8:32 - 8:36)
that much money (8:34 - 8:39)
um i'm a fan in theory i always think (8:36 - 8:40)
i'm going to like them but then i don't (8:39 - 8:42)
like using them (8:40 - 8:43)
oh i like using them i used to actually (8:42 - 8:45)
use them for work all the time (8:43 - 8:49)
um but they do require care (8:45 - 8:52)
maintenance and upkeep yeah they do and (8:49 - 8:55)
and i'm lazy yes give me the old pilot (8:52 - 8:59)
g2 and we'll be on our way (8:55 - 8:59)
the g2 is a great pen i don't is (8:59 - 9:05)
what size point is that (9:02 - 9:05)
if it's anything bigger than micro (9:06 - 9:09)
you've lost me (9:08 - 9:11)
this one right here the pilot g2 (9:09 - 9:12)
probably the best (9:11 - 9:16)
what size does it write with (9:12 - 9:19)
that's looking like it has a 10 at the (9:16 - 9:20)
end is that that's (9:19 - 9:22)
not no you've got micro you've got fine (9:20 - 9:23)
you've got (9:22 - 9:24)
whatever regular i don't know what they (9:23 - 9:26)
call it i'd because i only buy mike i (9:24 - 9:28)
call it smooth (9:26 - 9:32)
no so what is what is this brand pilot (9:28 - 9:34)
is the pilot g2 (9:32 - 9:36)
i am looking it up oh you guys don't (9:34 - 9:39)
know the pilot g2 (9:36 - 9:42)
oh okay well okay it comes in ultra fine (9:39 - 9:43)
extra fine (9:42 - 9:46)
fine and bold points so what did you get (9:43 - 9:49)
did you get ultra fine did you get fine (9:46 - 9:51)
whatever the standard is at target (9:49 - 9:53)
where's the box you got to look at the (9:51 - 9:55)
box now i gotta go to target (9:53 - 9:58)
is a 399 pen (9:55 - 10:02)
no one's keeping the box for this (9:58 - 10:06)
not with that attitude so i did look up (10:02 - 10:09)
the i did go to pilot's website you can (10:06 - 10:10)
find (10:09 - 10:12)
pretty much the same exact pen on (10:10 - 10:13)
pilot's website just without the (10:12 - 10:14)
engraving (10:13 - 10:17)
for about 600 (10:14 - 10:17)
so i don't think there was (10:17 - 10:20)
i i don't think uh although i am not a (10:20 - 10:26)
pen expert i am sure there is probably (10:24 - 10:28)
at least one person listening to this (10:26 - 10:30)
podcast that probably owns (10:28 - 10:32)
two one thousand dollar pens and this is (10:30 - 10:34)
their moment to shine (10:32 - 10:37)
uh but it doesn't look like (10:34 - 10:40)
this pen was any different than what (10:37 - 10:42)
pilot was already making (10:40 - 10:45)
just add the charizard engraving well i (10:42 - 10:46)
mean because (10:45 - 10:49)
because they already make a fine pen (10:46 - 10:51)
why would they need to i'm going to (10:49 - 10:53)
declare that you have (10:51 - 10:57)
fine point okay except it sounds fine (10:53 - 11:01)
i prefer micro but i will (10:57 - 11:05)
yes that's acceptable i mean the (11:01 - 11:07)
i guess the debate would be the same the (11:05 - 11:08)
similar pen is (11:07 - 11:12)
400 on pilot and they slapped a pikachu (11:08 - 11:13)
on it and they're charging 200 (11:12 - 11:14)
more but that doesn't seem to be the (11:13 - 11:18)
case that's called the pokemon tax (11:14 - 11:18)
i mean engraving isn't cheap with that (11:20 - 11:24)
level of skill (11:22 - 11:26)
they got the they got the people in the (11:24 - 11:28)
back room scratching it out (11:26 - 11:30)
do you think you've made it in this (11:28 - 11:31)
world (11:30 - 11:34)
and you're fine money wise if you're (11:31 - 11:35)
buying 600 (11:34 - 11:40)
pens yes i mean only 600 (11:35 - 11:43)
yes yeah there are pens that go (11:40 - 11:48)
quite a bit more than 600 if (11:43 - 11:50)
i mean you could be living paycheck to (11:48 - 11:52)
paycheck but still (11:50 - 11:55)
haven't pen obsession i'm sure (11:52 - 11:56)
there are people who live paycheck to (11:55 - 12:00)
paycheck who drive very fancy cars (11:56 - 12:02)
and they just put all that money into (12:00 - 12:04)
their car and (12:02 - 12:07)
i think it shows your true true love of (12:04 - 12:09)
pokemon if you're going to drop 600 (12:07 - 12:11)
on a pen that you have to take care of (12:09 - 12:14)
like it's a child (12:11 - 12:14)
you can be one of those people though (12:15 - 12:19)
that never use the pen (12:16 - 12:19)
you buy the 600 pen you put it on the (12:19 - 12:24)
bookshelf (12:22 - 12:27)
number one they sell cases for fountain (12:24 - 12:28)
pens (12:27 - 12:32)
display cases but i will say (12:28 - 12:34)
i have honestly never met a pen (12:32 - 12:36)
enthusiast (12:34 - 12:39)
who does not find a way to use their pen (12:36 - 12:42)
yeah yeah you got to get that smooth you (12:39 - 12:42)
know (12:42 - 12:44)
you have a pen enthusiast in your life (12:42 - 12:46)
when you start receiving monthly (12:44 - 12:49)
postcards (12:46 - 12:51)
well there are like the car enthusiasts (12:49 - 12:52)
that buy a car or power kid in the (12:51 - 12:54)
garage and they never drive it (12:52 - 12:57)
okay jay leno i'm pretty sure (12:54 - 12:59)
is dead (12:57 - 12:59)
oh death on this episode well i mean we (13:00 - 13:03)
got (13:03 - 13:07)
either 25th anniversary or okay (13:03 - 13:11)
pick one or the other 25th anniversary (13:07 - 13:12)
isn't holding up (13:11 - 13:14)
i got a list of dead celebrities (13:12 - 13:16)
basically kids they're all dead spoiler (13:14 - 13:18)
boarding sorry (13:16 - 13:20)
the the pokemon center put up the (13:18 - 13:22)
chilling rains we talked about this last (13:20 - 13:23)
week (13:22 - 13:25)
the elite trainer box chilling rains (13:23 - 13:27)
they were up last week they were still (13:25 - 13:29)
up they just recently sold out (13:27 - 13:32)
i think that's a really good sign for (13:29 - 13:33)
either one (13:32 - 13:35)
they figured out how to prevent scalpers (13:33 - 13:36)
from buying (13:35 - 13:39)
a bunch of these or number two (13:36 - 13:43)
scalpers or stop slowly stopping to care (13:39 - 13:44)
about pokemon cards (13:43 - 13:48)
because brand new set exclusively (13:44 - 13:49)
trainer box (13:48 - 13:52)
on pokemon center.com sat there for over (13:49 - 13:52)
a week (13:52 - 13:56)
it's pretty easy to pre-order so (13:52 - 13:59)
yeah yeah i did they're sold out now (13:56 - 14:03)
but speaking of pre-orders (13:59 - 14:05)
some co it only took them six months (14:03 - 14:06)
they figured out how to do pre-orders (14:05 - 14:08)
correctly here (14:06 - 14:11)
uh they put up series three of the bear (14:08 - 14:13)
walker skateboards i know will has a (14:11 - 14:14)
series two (14:13 - 14:17)
somewhere in that house yes correct it's (14:14 - 14:18)
uh actually over my (14:17 - 14:22)
fireplace on the mantel hanging on the (14:18 - 14:23)
wall (14:22 - 14:26)
i haven't taken it out of the box (14:23 - 14:28)
several steps down the line that i have (14:26 - 14:31)
not achieved (14:28 - 14:33)
interesting pokemon choices here so (14:31 - 14:35)
these bear walker skateboards as of this (14:33 - 14:37)
recording are still available for (14:35 - 14:38)
pre-order they've been (14:37 - 14:40)
available for the last three days i (14:38 - 14:41)
think which is (14:40 - 14:43)
different than the other bear walkers (14:41 - 14:45)
which sold out within two hours (14:43 - 14:49)
yep um they decided to do a pancham (14:45 - 14:53)
a snomm and a puke mew (14:49 - 14:56)
man that hand sham is legit yeah i want (14:53 - 14:57)
to say nam (14:56 - 14:59)
so much the panchayat is super cute but (14:57 - 15:01)
i feel like they missed an opportunity (14:59 - 15:03)
to do snom (15:01 - 15:06)
pukamuku and pinkerton like wouldn't (15:03 - 15:07)
that be the three (15:06 - 15:10)
you do together no no (15:07 - 15:14)
is pink urchin a pokemon (15:10 - 15:14)
i did it on purpose just to get that (15:17 - 15:21)
sigh (15:20 - 15:24)
yes i mean (15:21 - 15:27)
they pinch hurricane is electric so it (15:24 - 15:29)
doesn't fit the (15:27 - 15:33)
grass fire pink theme (15:29 - 15:36)
water snow theme well this (15:33 - 15:40)
is what ice water (15:36 - 15:44)
fighting what you're trying to (15:40 - 15:46)
there's no pattern here you have a bear (15:44 - 15:47)
and two (15:46 - 15:50)
sluggy things do not call my sweet (15:47 - 15:51)
snomed (15:50 - 15:56)
it's not a slug it's a it's a larvae (15:51 - 15:59)
it's more like a maggot i always love (15:56 - 16:00)
when they do non-traditional (15:59 - 16:03)
pokemon like the default here would be (16:00 - 16:04)
like (16:03 - 16:07)
grooky sable score bunny or (16:04 - 16:10)
um i don't know leafeon glaceon (16:07 - 16:13)
sylveon (16:10 - 16:13)
pancham is like okay people like panjam (16:14 - 16:21)
champion jam snom (16:18 - 16:23)
is probably one of the most popular (16:21 - 16:26)
pokemon from gen 8 (16:23 - 16:29)
and then there's pika pika pikamuku (16:26 - 16:32)
gives pikamuku has raised in popularity (16:29 - 16:38)
since pokemon snaps (16:32 - 16:38)
yeah i wonder if this had something to (16:42 - 16:46)
do with it probably (16:44 - 16:49)
i mean you you love to talk about (16:46 - 16:51)
the unified marketing universe of (16:49 - 16:52)
pokemon (16:51 - 16:55)
timelines and and how everything can (16:52 - 16:55)
sync (16:55 - 16:59)
up and hit right the unified uh (16:55 - 17:01)
cinematic merchandise universe of (16:59 - 17:02)
pokemon (17:01 - 17:04)
that's the name of my website the (17:02 - 17:06)
universal cinematic pokemon merchandise (17:04 - 17:08)
the pokemon (17:06 - 17:10)
tcumcu (17:08 - 17:13)
uh so they this is how pre-orders work (17:10 - 17:13)
though (17:13 - 17:16)
you don't you don't say that a (17:13 - 17:17)
skateboard's for pre-order and then it (17:16 - 17:18)
sells out an hour (17:17 - 17:21)
you put up the pre-orders you see how (17:18 - 17:23)
many people want the skateboards (17:21 - 17:24)
and then you sell the skateboards to (17:23 - 17:26)
them yeah but see now that's (17:24 - 17:30)
different because uh (17:26 - 17:33)
pre-orders of things like (17:30 - 17:37)
amiibo which are not numbered and (17:33 - 17:40)
limited edition yes you want to (17:37 - 17:40)
pre-order (17:40 - 17:42)
find out how many people want and then (17:40 - 17:44)
you make as many as people (17:42 - 17:46)
these skateboards are supposed to be (17:44 - 17:48)
numbered limited edition (17:46 - 17:51)
not make to order so (17:48 - 17:53)

much of a bro (20:23 - 20:26)
money's not that good in the bank or (20:24 - 20:27)
something think of (20:26 - 20:31)
the think of the 20-year value that (20:27 - 20:34)
skateboard will accumulate (20:31 - 20:35)
especially if it's paired with an (20:34 - 20:38)
ancient mew well i have ancient mute (20:35 - 20:39)
locked in the vault so don't even start (20:38 - 20:41)

maybe this is his last hurrah that's (20:56 - 20:59)
like pre-orders are (20:58 - 21:01)

him (21:01 - 21:05)
how many drinks that buys at the eagle (21:02 - 21:05)
like two (21:05 - 21:08)
but still (21:05 - 21:08)
uh pokemon center also restocked the (21:09 - 21:14)
sought after lapras (21:12 - 21:16)
float and they introduced a bunch of new (21:14 - 21:17)
float (21:16 - 21:21)
floaties is that the plural i (21:17 - 21:24)
think they smell like loading devices (21:21 - 21:25)
rafts (21:24 - 21:29)
rafts i mean it's a shape (21:25 - 21:31)
it's an inner tube they did a pikachu (21:29 - 21:33)
one and a (21:31 - 21:35)
psyduck one in the standard ring and (21:33 - 21:36)
then (21:35 - 21:39)
the they also did a brand new snorlax (21:36 - 21:40)
and a whalelord (21:39 - 21:45)
uh which are very large small (21:40 - 21:48)
uh but no one cares about snorlax and (21:45 - 21:49)
whaler the lapras is (21:48 - 21:53)
sold out and gone gen wonders (21:49 - 21:56)
poor waylord living his best life (21:53 - 22:00)
i need a pool (21:56 - 22:00)
okay i need a pool so that i have a (22:01 - 22:05)
reason to purchase these (22:03 - 22:08)
steps one you have a backyard i know you (22:05 - 22:10)
don't have to purchase a pool (22:08 - 22:12)
is that a pool there just start digging (22:10 - 22:13)
a hole and then fill it with cement and (22:12 - 22:14)
then fill it with water (22:13 - 22:16)
no you do with the above ground pool you (22:14 - 22:18)
don't do the below ground in the ground (22:16 - 22:18)
no you gotta (22:18 - 22:20)
ain't fancy how are you gonna show the (22:18 - 22:22)
pen people off if you don't have an (22:20 - 22:24)
in-ground pool (22:22 - 22:27)
pen people don't care about pools (22:24 - 22:27)
they don't look up from their writing to (22:28 - 22:31)
notice that i have a pool (22:30 - 22:34)
exactly what i need is that people to (22:31 - 22:36)
see me from an aerial shot (22:34 - 22:38)
lounging on my snorlax pool float in my (22:36 - 22:39)
pool (22:38 - 22:40)
you don't even live close enough to the (22:39 - 22:42)
airport to make it worth it don't waste (22:40 - 22:43)
your money on a pool (22:42 - 22:46)
i'm not plus did we outdoor pools of (22:43 - 22:46)
minnesota (22:46 - 22:51)
are a two month experience (22:46 - 22:54)
i mean honestly greg you could get the (22:51 - 22:55)
floatie (22:54 - 22:59)
and go to one of our many beaches (22:55 - 23:03)
which is a i don't understand how those (22:59 - 23:04)
two words go together (23:03 - 23:07)
because lakes are made of mud and (23:04 - 23:08)
beaches are made of sand (23:07 - 23:11)
but somehow out here in the middle of (23:08 - 23:13)
the country they've made it happen (23:11 - 23:15)
yeah you'll be talking to town we are (23:13 - 23:16)
crazy (23:15 - 23:19)
roll up with that wailord (23:16 - 23:22)
the raft yeah they know i they know (23:19 - 23:25)
what's coming (23:22 - 23:26)
way lord in a tank top and you're good (23:25 - 23:29)
to go i mean the art park has a place (23:26 - 23:31)
that people can swim in so we could go (23:29 - 23:32)
to the art park (23:31 - 23:35)
with our snorlax floaties and just take (23:32 - 23:37)
over (23:35 - 23:39)
yes did we talk about the slow poke last (23:37 - 23:40)
week (23:39 - 23:43)
the giant snow poke yeah i think we were (23:40 - 23:45)
mainly focused on (23:43 - 23:47)
uh yamper booty and i think we mentioned (23:45 - 23:49)
that there was a giant slow poke but (23:47 - 23:51)
definitely we can talk about the giant (23:49 - 23:54)
59-inch slowpoke (23:51 - 23:55)
oh yeah we didn't talk about slowpoke (23:54 - 23:57)
merchandise we did talk about the (23:55 - 23:58)
slowpoke event (23:57 - 24:02)
because once again in the coalescing (23:58 - 24:05)
universe of cross promotional (24:02 - 24:07)
you know slowpoke is now appearing (24:05 - 24:09)
everywhere in the pokemon (24:07 - 24:11)
world it's part of the pokemon cinematic (24:09 - 24:12)
universe (24:11 - 24:15)
merchandise i have a problem with the (24:12 - 24:17)
slowpoke plush it isn't the price (24:15 - 24:19)
although it is 450 dollars and still (24:17 - 24:20)
available for pre-order (24:19 - 24:23)
gravy what problem could you have (24:20 - 24:28)
the problem is they say that it's inside (24:23 - 24:31)
they say it's life-size right am i am i (24:28 - 24:33)
missing this (24:31 - 24:36)
where oh no they don't say it's (24:33 - 24:37)
life-size yeah yeah they say (24:36 - 24:40)
jumbo take it slow with the jumbo plush (24:37 - 24:42)
where'd you because when (24:40 - 24:44)
when the lady is holding said yeah we we (24:42 - 24:45)
did talk about this (24:44 - 24:47)
yeah when the when the lady is holding (24:45 - 24:48)
said slowpoke plush (24:47 - 24:51)
it's it's significantly bigger than her (24:48 - 24:53)
and i've never imagined slowpoke being (24:51 - 24:53)
bigger than (24:53 - 24:59)
a person i expect slowpoke to be like (24:53 - 25:02)
maybe like two cats big what (24:59 - 25:06)
that's just wrong maybe three cats (25:02 - 25:09)
all right how big your cat is (25:06 - 25:11)
what's the official slowpoke size yeah (25:09 - 25:13)
i'm looking that up right now i'm going (25:11 - 25:14)
to the sources (25:13 - 25:17)
because this slow poke is 26 inches tall (25:14 - 25:22)
freedom units and 59 inches long (25:17 - 25:24)
it says it's based on slowpoke's (25:22 - 25:27)
measurements in the official pokedex (25:24 - 25:31)
slowpoke is 311. yeah so it's actually (25:27 - 25:35)
shorter than the actual slowpoke (25:31 - 25:35)
because three feet is 36 inches yeah (25:35 - 25:40)
it's 311 it's all mixed up it doesn't (25:41 - 25:44)
know what to do unless (25:43 - 25:48)
oh good gracious greg (25:44 - 25:51)
i am about to walk off (25:48 - 25:54)
this program (25:51 - 25:54)
everyone in that band is dead (25:54 - 25:58)
[Music] (25:58 - 26:03)
man i used to listen to that for no good (26:01 - 26:04)
reason i (26:03 - 26:08)
still have one gracious they did one (26:04 - 26:12)
uh lady gaga cover and that was (26:08 - 26:15)
oh a 311 lady gaga cover for pride i'm (26:12 - 26:17)
here for it (26:15 - 26:20)
but slowpoke is 311 so this slowpoke is (26:17 - 26:23)
longer here's the issue with the concept (26:20 - 26:25)
of a slowpoke height (26:23 - 26:28)
okay is it from tummy to back (26:25 - 26:31)
because slowpoke is always just lounging (26:28 - 26:32)
around (26:31 - 26:36)
or is it from tail to head (26:32 - 26:39)
because you know a slow bro and a slow (26:36 - 26:40)
king (26:39 - 26:42)
can stand up well you can't count the (26:40 - 26:44)
tail because it can be pulled off (26:42 - 26:47)
so the tape grows succulent yeah but (26:44 - 26:49)
that's a variable that you can't (26:47 - 26:52)
count in the okay so is it from feet to (26:49 - 26:52)
top (26:52 - 26:54)
this plush would only be worth 450 (26:52 - 26:57)
dollars if you could chop the tail off (26:54 - 26:58)
and it grew back (26:57 - 27:01)
tail was removable it should be attached (26:58 - 27:02)
with velcro and you go (27:01 - 27:06)
and then give it to your dog (27:02 - 27:08)
and then you get a replacement sent to (27:06 - 27:10)
you (27:08 - 27:10)
it makes an eye-catching decoration in (27:12 - 27:15)
any room (27:14 - 27:18)
or office steve it could be on top of (27:15 - 27:19)
that (27:18 - 27:21)
large meowth right now if he puts one (27:19 - 27:23)
more thing in that office the office is (27:21 - 27:24)
gonna explode (27:23 - 27:26)
just think about it you can have a giant (27:24 - 27:29)
slow poke behind you with your bts (27:26 - 27:33)
toilet paper on the back of the slowpoke (27:29 - 27:36)
you don't know that's true of 30 rolls (27:33 - 27:38)
of bts toilet paper (27:36 - 27:39)
i've thought about this i look i have (27:38 - 27:41)
thought feel sealed (27:39 - 27:44)
still sealed still sealed it's (27:41 - 27:47)
it's only going up in value every day (27:44 - 27:50)
i have thought about said slowpoke (27:47 - 27:52)
but the problem with these plushes as i (27:50 - 27:53)
learned from the (27:52 - 27:56)
gigantomax meowth i have (27:53 - 27:59)
and i was like wow what a great purchase (27:56 - 28:00)
i can make tick tocks with this (27:59 - 28:03)
i can make youtube videos i can do a lot (28:00 - 28:04)
with this (28:03 - 28:07)
thing that's behind me but what they (28:04 - 28:08)
don't tell you (28:07 - 28:12)
prior to you ordering it and before it (28:08 - 28:13)
arrives to you (28:12 - 28:16)
is that it just minimizes the amount of (28:13 - 28:18)
space you have in your house (28:16 - 28:19)
if you want to make any rooms yes (28:18 - 28:21)
reduces yeah if you want to make (28:19 - 28:24)
any room smaller you have it (28:21 - 28:27)
why isn't it in your bed as a body (28:24 - 28:28)
pillow (28:27 - 28:31)
it's main function to hug it and comfort (28:28 - 28:32)
it all night (28:31 - 28:35)
bed is already taken up by real cats (28:32 - 28:39)
real cats look at a bigger bed (28:35 - 28:42)
get your you get your uh alaskan king (28:39 - 28:43)
bed (28:42 - 28:45)
no i wanted a california king first of (28:43 - 28:47)
all i mean i have a california king but (28:45 - 28:48)
now that you have this giant mouth (28:47 - 28:49)
you're gonna have to bump it up to (28:48 - 28:50)
alaska (28:49 - 28:54)
no i don't that's too big look at the (28:50 - 28:55)
size of the slowpoke (28:54 - 28:57)
and look at the size of the mouth and (28:55 - 28:58)
tell me you don't need that size of a (28:57 - 28:59)
bed (28:58 - 29:02)
okay even even if i had an alaskan king (28:59 - 29:05)
and i already was it was full of plushes (29:02 - 29:07)
there's no such thing as an alaskan king (29:05 - 29:09)
i think there there's a size bigger than (29:07 - 29:11)
california king no (29:09 - 29:14)
there is yeah it's called custom-made it (29:11 - 29:14)
might be like an (29:14 - 29:18)
alabama king or something no (29:14 - 29:18)
i think there's something bigger i (29:19 - 29:23)
reject all this (29:21 - 29:26)
an alaskan king bed measures 108 inches (29:23 - 29:29)
by 108 inches 9 feet by 9 feet and is (29:26 - 29:31)
the largest mattress available this is (29:29 - 29:35)
made up it's not real this is from a (29:31 - 29:36)
thing that says (29:35 - 29:38)
what's a wyoming king an alaskan king (29:36 - 29:40)
and a texas king (29:38 - 29:43)
now now now now ought to all of them (29:40 - 29:48)
now but okay maybe i (29:43 - 29:50)
don't know how to store plushes maybe (29:48 - 29:51)
this is my downfall (29:50 - 29:54)
because how are other people storing (29:51 - 29:55)
their meowth where are they putting it (29:54 - 29:57)
you find a closet you put it in the (29:55 - 30:00)
closet you hang it up in the closet and (29:57 - 30:01)
so that when people open it up there's a (30:00 - 30:02)
meowth in there (30:01 - 30:05)
what a pleasant surprise that everyone's (30:02 - 30:07)
looking forward to (30:05 - 30:09)
like my square footage in my house just (30:07 - 30:11)
keeps going down and down because of (30:09 - 30:12)
these brushes (30:11 - 30:15)
correct get a vacuum sealed bag (30:12 - 30:18)
i could have got half a pen for the cost (30:15 - 30:19)
of meowth (30:18 - 30:21)
and i would have gotten more of my (30:19 - 30:23)
office back (30:21 - 30:25)
and something to write with you wouldn't (30:23 - 30:27)
have to be destroying the environment by (30:25 - 30:29)
perpetually investing in these pilot g2s (30:27 - 30:31)
that you dispose of once the ink runs (30:29 - 30:32)
out (30:31 - 30:34)
you could have a nice fountain pen that (30:32 - 30:36)
you just slurp up the ink into a (30:34 - 30:37)
re-fillable (30:36 - 30:40)
glass inkwell like that sentence (30:37 - 30:42)
slurpee i'm i i am a master of the (30:40 - 30:44)
english language (30:42 - 30:46)
and several others and yes (30:44 - 30:48)
[Music] (30:46 - 30:52)
we need to take a break to do what (30:48 - 30:55)
deal with your with your mouth issue (30:52 - 30:59)
or to order this incredible wonderful (30:55 - 31:01)
slowpoke plush that would look great (30:59 - 31:03)
with a bunch of bts (31:01 - 31:06)
toilet paper on it at this point when i (31:03 - 31:08)
hopefully eventually move to minnesota (31:06 - 31:10)
i'm gonna have to get a separate u-haul (31:08 - 31:14)
for meowth yes yes slowpoke (31:10 - 31:16)
at this point meowth will just drive on (31:14 - 31:17)
there (31:16 - 31:19)
buy the airplane ticket and just have it (31:17 - 31:20)
fly it's like what a (31:19 - 31:24)
20 minute flight yeah only like a 200 (31:20 - 31:27)
ticket i'm sure then (31:24 - 31:29)
then you're even closer to the amount of (31:27 - 31:31)
the pen (31:29 - 31:31)
all right we'll be right back (31:32 - 31:58)
[Music] (31:47 - 31:58)
did you see the (31:58 - 32:13)
[Music] (31:59 - 32:15)
yes (32:13 - 32:22)
[Music] (32:15 - 32:22)
dynamics (32:27 - 32:30)
[Music] (32:32 - 32:38)
and we are back from our break (32:41 - 32:48)
before we get into the rest of the news (32:46 - 32:49)
we have (32:48 - 32:52)
yes can we get can we pour one out for (32:49 - 32:54)
pokemon snap (32:52 - 32:56)
oh did that die too why no one seems to (32:54 - 32:57)
care anymore (32:56 - 33:01)
that and post milan what did you expect (32:57 - 33:05)
the game came out what a month ago (33:01 - 33:07)
uh yeah like five weeks ago it's a (33:05 - 33:09)
single player game (33:07 - 33:11)
that everybody talked about posted all (33:09 - 33:12)
their pictures (33:11 - 33:15)
played 60 hours in (33:12 - 33:18)
60 hours is like less than two work (33:15 - 33:18)
weeks (33:18 - 33:21)
for business all these people are like (33:18 - 33:25)
pokemon snap is dead it was a good game (33:21 - 33:27)
everybody loved it it lived its life (33:25 - 33:28)
what do you know (33:27 - 33:31)
what do you want no i mean it was fine (33:28 - 33:31)
it was good (33:31 - 33:35)
it was just that i told you a lot i'm (33:31 - 33:40)
still stuck on meganium (33:35 - 33:40)
a better game came out that's the life (33:41 - 33:44)
cycle of these things (33:43 - 33:46)
i abandoned animal crossing for sword (33:44 - 33:49)
and shield i abandoned pokemon snap for (33:46 - 33:51)
the bar superior metopia (33:49 - 33:53)
i definitely enjoyed my time with (33:51 - 33:55)
pokemon snap i mean i streamed it for (33:53 - 33:56)
like three weeks (33:55 - 33:58)
yep and that third week i was streaming (33:56 - 34:00)
it it just didn't seem like people (33:58 - 34:02)
cared anymore even though i wasn't even (34:00 - 34:03)
close to being done with the game (34:02 - 34:06)
i mean i finished my pokedex i got all (34:03 - 34:09)
the hundred and (34:06 - 34:13)
how many pokemon 214 pokemon 14 yeah (34:09 - 34:15)
i finished that i didn't get to go back (34:13 - 34:16)
and do (34:15 - 34:19)
four stars on every picture but i (34:16 - 34:22)
probably would have needed 200 to 300 (34:19 - 34:23)
more (34:22 - 34:25)
i didn't get all the titles did they did (34:23 - 34:26)
somebody from your stream come and steal (34:25 - 34:28)
your copy of the game (34:26 - 34:32)
no i just things happen i moved on to (34:28 - 34:33)
different games (34:32 - 34:35)
but also i'm not going to stream a game (34:33 - 34:36)
that you know people don't seem super (34:35 - 34:39)
interested in (34:36 - 34:39)
i can understand that yeah i think (34:41 - 34:44)
there's like a i think there's a (34:43 - 34:45)
conversation that (34:44 - 34:46)
i probably don't want to have today (34:45 - 34:49)
about how like going back to our (34:46 - 34:50)
original (34:49 - 34:51)
talks like five weeks ago about how (34:50 - 34:53)
people wanted shinies and people wanted (34:51 - 34:54)
dlc (34:53 - 34:55)
i don't think any of that would have (34:54 - 34:57)
extended the game but besides maybe (34:55 - 34:59)
people playing an extra day or two (34:57 - 35:01)
well no but that's what happens with dlc (34:59 - 35:04)
and stuff i mean i give it an extra week (35:01 - 35:06)
more than an extra day or two yeah but i (35:04 - 35:08)
mean (35:06 - 35:11)
i mean so compare this to like sword and (35:08 - 35:13)
shield to get through this (35:11 - 35:15)
the base story of sword and shield is a (35:13 - 35:16)
30 hour experience (35:15 - 35:21)
and then a lot of people stop yeah so (35:16 - 35:23)
i think the post game is both there for (35:21 - 35:25)
sword and shield and snap right like you (35:23 - 35:26)
can shiny huh (35:25 - 35:29)
you can go to the battle tower you can (35:26 - 35:31)
breed you can (35:29 - 35:33)
collect all the items i do think they (35:31 - 35:34)
did like (35:33 - 35:37)
there's no disservice or hard feelings i (35:34 - 35:39)
have for pokemon snap i think their post (35:37 - 35:40)
game of (35:39 - 35:43)
finish the pokedex get all the pictures (35:40 - 35:44)
upload to leaderboard (35:43 - 35:46)
i think it was all great yeah i just (35:44 - 35:48)
don't know how (35:46 - 35:49)
maybe it doesn't matter i just don't (35:48 - 35:51)
know how they get people to (35:49 - 35:52)
i think they were close to getting (35:51 - 35:55)
people to come back to it every day (35:52 - 35:57)
i think if the leaderboard refreshed in (35:55 - 35:59)
a better way (35:57 - 36:02)
instead of like once that thursday night (35:59 - 36:02)
hit (36:02 - 36:04)
which is when the leaderboard refreshed (36:02 - 36:05)
whoever (36:04 - 36:07)
they grabbed for like top photos they (36:05 - 36:10)
would stay top photos for the week (36:07 - 36:14)
um and then it kind of did a bad job (36:10 - 36:17)
at refreshing photos to show to you i (36:14 - 36:19)
feel like they were so close to (36:17 - 36:21)
and that's the problem not a problem but (36:19 - 36:23)
that's like the struggle that a lot of (36:21 - 36:24)
games have is (36:23 - 36:26)
how do we get our players to come back (36:24 - 36:28)
every day (36:26 - 36:28)
but also we need to make sure that we're (36:28 - 36:32)
not confusing the concept of (36:30 - 36:35)
mobile gaming which is we need continue (36:32 - 36:37)
just mobile anything at this point like (36:35 - 36:40)
we need continuous engagement from (36:37 - 36:40)
players (36:40 - 36:43)
over all time unending they must come (36:40 - 36:46)
and touch us at least once a day (36:43 - 36:50)
versus the console based (36:46 - 36:53)
gaming experience which is a game can be (36:50 - 36:54)
successful (36:53 - 36:56)
if people play it all the way through (36:54 - 36:58)
enjoy it and put it away (36:56 - 37:01)
i have not played the legend of zelda (36:58 - 37:04)
the original legend of zelda in many (37:01 - 37:04)
many years (37:04 - 37:08)
it's still a really good game (37:04 - 37:11)
i i think it's fine that (37:08 - 37:13)
i i think snap had a longer life than (37:11 - 37:15)
people expected (37:13 - 37:18)
yeah but there's no real (37:15 - 37:22)
collection like you aren't looking for (37:18 - 37:24)
something to add to your collection it's (37:22 - 37:26)
not like (37:24 - 37:27)
sword and shield where you have these (37:26 - 37:28)
things that you're going to be able to (37:27 - 37:29)
put them in home that you're (37:28 - 37:31)
you're able to shiny hunt that you're (37:29 - 37:34)
able to to use on teams that you're able (37:31 - 37:36)
to trade to other people (37:34 - 37:39)
it has sort of a built-in endpoint get (37:36 - 37:40)
all the pictures (37:39 - 37:43)
see all the cool scenes and that's fine (37:40 - 37:45)
for a game it's not (37:43 - 37:48)
it wasn't built to be a forever game it (37:45 - 37:50)
was built to be a beautiful (37:48 - 37:52)
experience which it was and then you're (37:50 - 37:54)
like cool (37:52 - 37:56)
and if dlc came out it would be super (37:54 - 37:57)
popular and people like yeah i'll go (37:56 - 37:59)
visit that again for a week (37:57 - 38:02)
i really liked it it (37:59 - 38:05)
it just have been a game that people got (38:02 - 38:06)
a lot of fun out of (38:05 - 38:08)
and then ended it's not an animal (38:06 - 38:10)
crossing but we've also (38:08 - 38:14)
uncovered a very deep fail in the (38:10 - 38:18)
coalescing expanded pokemon universe (38:14 - 38:19)
intersectionality (38:18 - 38:23)
in that by releasing the lapras floaty (38:19 - 38:26)
before the predetermined end-of-time (38:23 - 38:30)
life of pokemon snap and the skateboards (38:26 - 38:31)
everybody is like (38:30 - 38:33)
running to be outdoors and it's like you (38:31 - 38:35)
can't you either (38:33 - 38:37)
floating down the river in your lapras (38:35 - 38:39)
floaty or you're sitting in front of the (38:37 - 38:39)
tv (38:39 - 38:41)
playing pokemon snap but you can't do (38:39 - 38:42)
both (38:41 - 38:45)
so hey those nintendo commercials told (38:42 - 38:46)
me that i take my (38:45 - 38:48)
switch to a rooftop there's other people (38:46 - 38:49)
with the rooftop (38:48 - 38:51)
is not not floaty too i can take my (38:49 - 38:53)
switch on that lapras floaty (38:51 - 38:55)
i just gotta make sure i don't drop it (38:53 - 38:56)
in the water no you have to be (38:55 - 39:00)
in that rare that very small wedge (38:56 - 39:02)
percentage of humanity (39:00 - 39:04)
that number one has an accessible (39:02 - 39:05)
rooftop that you can (39:04 - 39:08)
go out and sit upon number two has a (39:05 - 39:10)
floaty kiddie pool which i know you do (39:08 - 39:12)
because i saw you open it on your stream (39:10 - 39:14)
you've got the pokemon kiddie pool that (39:12 - 39:16)
you can then fill with water (39:14 - 39:19)
and put a lapras floaty into i think the (39:16 - 39:22)
lapras is bigger than the (39:19 - 39:22)
i'm almost positive that's called (39:23 - 39:27)
planning (39:25 - 39:30)
uh i mean (39:27 - 39:30)
do you think developers do you think (39:30 - 39:35)
bandai namco namco bandai (39:32 - 39:38)
do you think they know that like (39:35 - 39:40)
we're releasing this game they think (39:38 - 39:41)
it's solid i thought it was solid i (39:40 - 39:42)
thought it was a very good game do you (39:41 - 39:44)
think they're like this game is going to (39:42 - 39:45)
come and go (39:44 - 39:48)
yeah uh i'm sure they think this is how (39:45 - 39:50)
much money this game is going yeah (39:48 - 39:53)
yeah period it could be a five minute (39:50 - 39:53)
game (39:53 - 39:55)
but if it tracks out to 50 billion (39:53 - 39:57)
dollars it's getting made it is a (39:55 - 39:58)
success (39:57 - 40:00)
yeah i mean i think they counted as a (39:58 - 40:01)
success it sold (40:00 - 40:03)
well didn't it yeah i i think it is yeah (40:01 - 40:04)
i don't i (40:03 - 40:07)
doubt it wasn't i mean i think they were (40:04 - 40:10)
like yeah this is a single person set (40:07 - 40:11)
established game (40:10 - 40:14)
and you'll play it and you'll get what (40:11 - 40:15)
you get out of it it will sell really (40:14 - 40:16)
well and (40:15 - 40:19)
and done not only did it sell really (40:16 - 40:20)
well it got (40:19 - 40:23)
really good reviews yeah hey this is (40:20 - 40:25)
what better review can you ask for that (40:23 - 40:27)
this is better than i was expecting (40:25 - 40:30)
i mean i'm happy with this for the two (40:27 - 40:31)
weeks (40:30 - 40:33)
that it was in the public conscience it (40:31 - 40:34)
was (40:33 - 40:35)
everybody was talking about it and (40:34 - 40:37)
everybody loved it i don't think they (40:35 - 40:38)
can (40:37 - 40:41)
get a better proof to the pokemon (40:38 - 40:43)
company that they did a really good game (40:41 - 40:45)
i don't think they needed to make the (40:43 - 40:47)
game more than they did and i don't (40:45 - 40:48)
think it needed to last longer than it (40:47 - 40:49)
did (40:48 - 40:52)
i mean it is an experienced game and you (40:49 - 40:55)
had a great experience with it (40:52 - 40:58)
i did i really like that game a lot (40:55 - 40:58)
and people's i mean to capture people's (40:58 - 41:03)
attention for two weeks (41:01 - 41:06)
is not a small feat these days that is a (41:03 - 41:07)
long chunk of time (41:06 - 41:10)
true for a game to have captured a huge (41:07 - 41:11)
swath of people (41:10 - 41:15)
for for a a big part of their (41:11 - 41:21)
of their ramp up to summer (41:15 - 41:24)
i agree i just want i just want to talk (41:21 - 41:25)
about pokemon snap i just like that game (41:24 - 41:27)
a lot (41:25 - 41:28)

a wonderful life (41:28 - 41:32)

yeah enough legal controversies (42:50 - 42:56)
we need we need more we haven't had (42:54 - 42:58)
anything we need milwaukee to do (42:56 - 43:01)
more looney tunes anti-pokemon go stuff (42:58 - 43:02)
so that we can (43:01 - 43:05)
have that to talk about (43:02 - 43:05)
this has nothing to do with lawyers uh (43:06 - 43:09)
they released (43:08 - 43:12)
the new gimmick for the tcg (43:09 - 43:16)
do you think i remember (43:12 - 43:19)
there was a time where people were like (43:16 - 43:23)
giganta max is dumb dynamaxx is dumb (43:19 - 43:26)
bring back megas these people know (43:23 - 43:28)
nothing about pokemon (43:26 - 43:29)
let me introduce you to the pokemon (43:28 - 43:31)
trading card game where gimmicks are (43:29 - 43:34)
even more dumb (43:31 - 43:37)
there was a mc before we get to this new (43:34 - 43:38)
gimmick that they showed off (43:37 - 43:42)
it's called the union by the way (43:38 - 43:44)
i saw this in my instagram story is this (43:42 - 43:46)
like legion and card fight vanguard (43:44 - 43:47)
because man that drove (43:46 - 43:49)
so many players away and they were just (43:47 - 43:50)
they were just mad (43:49 - 43:52)
about it we'll circle back to what v (43:50 - 43:54)
union is i need to lay the groundwork (43:52 - 43:54)
here (43:54 - 43:57)
when will and i got into the pokemon (43:54 - 43:58)
trading card game (43:57 - 44:01)
competitively it was around (43:58 - 44:04)
heart gold soul silver undaunted black (44:01 - 44:04)
and white (44:04 - 44:06)
black and white emerging black and white (44:04 - 44:08)
for me yeah (44:06 - 44:11)
and there were these cards called legend (44:08 - 44:12)
cards (44:11 - 44:15)
i owned them all and they were not (44:12 - 44:17)
good there were points in time (44:15 - 44:19)
throughout the competitive scene where (44:17 - 44:20)
they were (44:19 - 44:23)
maybe like b-tier at best they weren't (44:20 - 44:25)
like a decks they were like (44:23 - 44:28)
b decks and before anyone writes in and (44:25 - 44:31)
like i won with kyogre groudon (44:28 - 44:33)
i am sure there are very good players (44:31 - 44:35)
that were able to make these decks (44:33 - 44:39)
work for them there's a very specific (44:35 - 44:40)
situation (44:39 - 44:42)
where my friend kyle sukovich whose name (44:40 - 44:43)
is puka (44:42 - 44:47)
he was the best player in wisconsin and (44:43 - 44:49)
he won with like this vanilla (44:47 - 44:52)
vanilla victini deck at a like a battle (44:49 - 44:53)
roads (44:52 - 44:55)
and the only reason he won wasn't (44:53 - 44:57)
because this deck was like an a-tier (44:55 - 44:58)
deck (44:57 - 45:00)
he even admitted that it was just a fun (44:58 - 45:02)
deck he wanted to play but because he (45:00 - 45:03)
won the battle roads (45:02 - 45:05)
tons of people started building vanilla (45:03 - 45:07)
mctv (45:05 - 45:10)
because he won with it so i don't doubt (45:07 - 45:13)
people won with these legend cards but (45:10 - 45:14)
they were awful let me explain what they (45:13 - 45:16)
were (45:14 - 45:18)
do everyone listening to show knows what (45:16 - 45:19)
a full art card is (45:18 - 45:22)
it's it's a pokemon card usually the (45:19 - 45:24)
pokemon takes up the entire card (45:22 - 45:27)
the art is pretty good legend cards (45:24 - 45:29)
during heart gold soul silver (45:27 - 45:32)
were two cards that made up one (45:29 - 45:35)
card so for there was like cresselia (45:32 - 45:37)
darkrai (45:35 - 45:41)
uh like ryko suicune kyogre groudon (45:37 - 45:44)
uh rayquaza was just he they were on (45:41 - 45:45)
their own card and you just (45:44 - 45:47)
the top half was his head the bottom (45:45 - 45:49)
half was his butt (45:47 - 45:53)
the snakes have butts i guess so snakes (45:49 - 45:55)
yeah it's like a dragon he's a dragon (45:53 - 45:57)
dragon snake and dragons are just big (45:55 - 45:58)
snakes (45:57 - 46:02)
so like kyogre groudon legend (45:58 - 46:04)
so kyogre's on like the top part (46:02 - 46:05)
groudon's on the bottom and (46:04 - 46:08)
when you're playing the tcg you needed (46:05 - 46:11)
both of these cards in your hand at the (46:08 - 46:12)
same time (46:11 - 46:14)
in order to play it down on your bench (46:12 - 46:16)
uh and you can only play (46:14 - 46:18)
at the time you could only play two of (46:16 - 46:20)
each because they were considered (46:18 - 46:23)
one card so you could have two kyogres (46:20 - 46:24)
and two groudons (46:23 - 46:27)
but the bad thing is if you relied on (46:24 - 46:29)
this as your wind condition in your deck (46:27 - 46:33)
and both kyogres were in the prizes (46:29 - 46:35)
and you got two bottom half of groudon (46:33 - 46:36)
that you can't do anything with you're (46:35 - 46:37)
kind of (46:36 - 46:39)
you can't do anything with and (46:37 - 46:41)
specifically their moves were pretty (46:39 - 46:43)
expensive they were pretty hard to power (46:41 - 46:44)
up (46:43 - 46:48)
and normally the the reason why these (46:44 - 46:50)
don't do particularly well (46:48 - 46:52)
is because when you have a mechanic in (46:50 - 46:54)
the trading card game (46:52 - 46:57)
to quickly accelerate energy (46:54 - 46:58)
so let's say for example i'm trying to (46:57 - 47:00)
make this as easy as possible let's say (46:58 - 47:01)
you're running a water deck (47:00 - 47:03)
usually the the easiest way to run a (47:01 - 47:05)
water deck is to run like a blastoise (47:03 - 47:08)
and blastoise has an ability to (47:05 - 47:10)
normally like take energy from your hand (47:08 - 47:12)
and you can put as many on your pokemon (47:10 - 47:15)
as you want but blastoise is a stage two (47:12 - 47:16)
so you gotta have the squirtles you (47:15 - 47:18)
gotta have the rare candy you gotta have (47:16 - 47:19)
the war totals you gotta have the (47:18 - 47:21)
blastoise it takes (47:19 - 47:23)
sometimes it's hard to get blastoise up (47:21 - 47:25)
and running and so not only would you (47:23 - 47:26)
have to get blastoise up and running (47:25 - 47:28)
you got to try to figure out how to get (47:26 - 47:29)
kyogre groudon up and running because (47:28 - 47:31)
you got to get two of these cards (47:29 - 47:33)
in your hand at the same time and (47:31 - 47:35)
normally with like a blastoise (47:33 - 47:39)
kind of deck have one (47:35 - 47:43)
powerful ex or gx or v card because it's (47:39 - 47:44)
just simpler that way right (47:43 - 47:46)
instead of needing squirtle and rare (47:44 - 47:49)
candy and blastoise just run a keldio (47:46 - 47:50)
like caldeo is pretty all right (47:49 - 47:53)
it has good hp decent attack so that's (47:50 - 47:55)
like the dilemma (47:53 - 48:00)
these cards existed we are now in 2021 (47:55 - 48:03)
and the pokemon company said nah two (48:00 - 48:07)
cards not enough v union (48:03 - 48:10)
you you so how do you do you (48:07 - 48:12)
can you willingly discard things do you (48:10 - 48:13)
have to put them on a bench and hope (48:12 - 48:14)
they get knocked out (48:13 - 48:18)
yeah so so instead of the the legends (48:14 - 48:19)
you needed them in your hand (48:18 - 48:21)
and you play the two legends in your (48:19 - 48:23)
hand at the same time to your bench (48:21 - 48:26)
so the so you still need four (48:23 - 48:29)
union cards they need to go into your (48:26 - 48:31)
discard pile first (48:29 - 48:32)
once they go into your discard pile you (48:31 - 48:35)
can then put it on your bench (48:32 - 48:38)
there are ways to discard cards (48:35 - 48:40)
um although they got rid of ultra ball (48:38 - 48:42)
which is probably the (48:40 - 48:43)
people's favorite way of discarding it (48:42 - 48:46)
so ultra ball was discard two cards from (48:43 - 48:47)
your hand searching your deck for any (48:46 - 48:49)
pokemon (48:47 - 48:51)
um there's like usually like professor (48:49 - 48:52)
juniper (48:51 - 48:55)
or professors research which you discard (48:52 - 48:58)
your entire hand and draw seven cards (48:55 - 49:01)
um there are cards that let you discard (48:58 - 49:02)
but the (49:01 - 49:03)
there there are a couple problems here (49:02 - 49:05)
that i at least see (49:03 - 49:07)
although i would assume that the people (49:05 - 49:09)
making gimmicks in the pokemon trading (49:07 - 49:09)
card game (49:09 - 49:11)
i would assume that they play tested (49:09 - 49:13)
this and that they um (49:11 - 49:16)
i don't know yu-gi-oh has this kind of (49:13 - 49:17)
stuff they have like yeah (49:16 - 49:20)
zodia uh the only thing i remember from (49:17 - 49:21)
the curtains (49:20 - 49:23)
you've been hitting zodia in like 28 (49:21 - 49:26)
years you can still play exodia (49:23 - 49:28)
yeah as far as i know exodia is still (49:26 - 49:30)
out there the various pieces throughout (49:28 - 49:33)
the world and once you collect (49:30 - 49:37)
five of them you get exodia and exodia (49:33 - 49:38)
destroys the world (49:37 - 49:39)
and of course then you win then you win (49:38 - 49:42)
because the world is gone (49:39 - 49:42)
so the problem with this (49:43 - 49:47)
is that you can only run you can only (49:47 - 49:50)
run one v (49:49 - 49:53)
union card so there's there's three of (49:50 - 49:54)
them they showed (49:53 - 49:57)
greninja v union zashian v union (49:54 - 50:00)
v union so you can't have like two (49:57 - 50:01)
mewtwo v (50:00 - 50:03)
unions or a mewtwo and azashian you can (50:01 - 50:04)
only play one per your (50:03 - 50:07)
deck but what i said earlier (50:04 - 50:09)
the same thing that applies the legends (50:07 - 50:11)
applies here if left (50:09 - 50:14)
thigh of mewtwo is in your discard or as (50:11 - 50:15)
in your (50:14 - 50:18)
prizes and the other three are in your (50:15 - 50:20)
discard pile you still can't play mewtwo (50:18 - 50:22)
until you get that prize card (50:20 - 50:26)
because you're relying on all of those (50:22 - 50:27)
to be in your deck and not prized (50:26 - 50:31)
although there's there has been cards (50:27 - 50:33)
like gladion (50:31 - 50:37)
that can help you switch out your prizes (50:33 - 50:41)
um and these (50:37 - 50:44)
cards have four different moves (50:41 - 50:47)
and or abilities so for example uh (50:44 - 50:48)
greninja has (50:47 - 50:50)
four attacks and has an ability and its (50:48 - 50:52)
ability it has two abilities actually (50:50 - 50:54)
one ability is it can't be poisoned the (50:52 - 50:56)
other ability is (50:54 - 50:59)
at any point uh your opponent plays an (50:56 - 51:00)
item from (50:59 - 51:04)
um their hand you can just (51:00 - 51:10)
uh you prevent that from happening (51:04 - 51:10)
so that that would be like if they try (51:10 - 51:14)
to crushing hammer you they just can't (51:12 - 51:19)
um does it also have probing foot (51:14 - 51:22)
yeah it's got three abilities oh (51:19 - 51:24)
wait what yeah it does have three (51:22 - 51:26)
billies three abilities one attack (51:24 - 51:29)
right no the greninja has (51:26 - 51:31)
multiple attacks greninja has like water (51:29 - 51:33)
water colorless this attack is 180 to a (51:31 - 51:34)
bench (51:33 - 51:36)
three abilities and four attacks okay (51:34 - 51:37)
she's (51:36 - 51:41)
uh it's 300 hp kazashian's 320 hp (51:37 - 51:43)
it doesn't have any abilities it just (51:41 - 51:47)
has four attacks and the me too has (51:43 - 51:50)
one ability for attacks yeah it really (51:47 - 51:52)
went all out on that greninja card geez (51:50 - 51:55)
yeah um (51:52 - 51:57)
and is this this professor burnett is (51:55 - 52:00)
supposed to help this whole thing happen (51:57 - 52:02)
yeah i mean professor burnette would (52:00 - 52:04)
would be very good for like any deck (52:02 - 52:07)
so it's it's a weird concept because you (52:04 - 52:08)
can actually have (52:07 - 52:12)
all of the different v union pokemon (52:08 - 52:15)
in your deck no you can only have one (52:12 - 52:18)
no no no you can have you can have the (52:15 - 52:19)
union greninja you can have the (52:18 - 52:22)
unizasian there's no restriction on (52:19 - 52:24)
having multiple viewings but the thing (52:22 - 52:26)
is when you play (52:24 - 52:29)
v union greninja once from your discard (52:26 - 52:30)
to your bench (52:29 - 52:32)
that's the only time you can play it (52:30 - 52:34)
once it's knocked out you cannot play it (52:32 - 52:35)
again (52:34 - 52:38)
oh i see what you're saying (52:35 - 52:38)
the other there's also like (52:42 - 52:49)
i don't know how yu-gi-oh does this or (52:47 - 52:51)
there's like other card games i think (52:49 - 52:52)
that have four cards (52:51 - 52:55)
to do this (52:52 - 52:55)
but if you're like a new player to the (52:56 - 52:59)
game (52:58 - 53:02)
and you open up a booster pack like (52:59 - 53:03)
you're like i'm getting back into the (53:02 - 53:05)
pokemon card game here we go (53:03 - 53:07)
and you open up a booster pack and your (53:05 - 53:09)
friend gets like (53:07 - 53:12)
full art cynthia and you're like man (53:09 - 53:13)
that card is so cool and then you open (53:12 - 53:15)
your pack and you're like (53:13 - 53:19)
i got mewtwo's thigh (53:15 - 53:22)
it's just literally the card is just his (53:19 - 53:24)
leg (53:22 - 53:26)
and see and it's my favorite time of (53:24 - 53:28)
year because all of a sudden (53:26 - 53:30)
i start getting messages on facebook (53:28 - 53:32)
messenger and twitter (53:30 - 53:34)
and any other instagram and somebody (53:32 - 53:36)
will like literally send me a picture of (53:34 - 53:37)
mewtwo's thigh (53:36 - 53:40)
and say i just got this in the pack what (53:37 - 53:41)
is this (53:40 - 53:42)
so do we think they're actually going to (53:41 - 53:44)
put them in packs or is it just going to (53:42 - 53:45)
be the (53:44 - 53:47)
the specialty package you get the four (53:45 - 53:48)
reunion cards (53:47 - 53:51)
and you just have to buy that that (53:48 - 53:53)
blister pack to get that and they're not (53:51 - 53:56)
going to be how they do that for america (53:53 - 53:59)
because it seems weird to (53:56 - 54:02)
collect all four of these yeah (53:59 - 54:04)
oh it doesn't seem like a [ __ ] thing (54:02 - 54:06)
to collect no (54:04 - 54:08)
like like if you're buying booster packs (54:06 - 54:09)
and you're like i keep pulling (54:08 - 54:13)
yeah greninja's tongue i feel like it's (54:09 - 54:15)
it's a thing that you buy a specialty (54:13 - 54:18)
blister pack for and they have (54:15 - 54:20)
the worst two other card packs in the (54:18 - 54:23)
back that are still relevant (54:20 - 54:26)
yeah in japan they're coming in um (54:23 - 54:30)
60 card decks that are like 15 bucks (54:26 - 54:34)
so you get you get the greninja union (54:30 - 54:37)
and then you get 56 other cards (54:34 - 54:39)
for like a pre-made deck i feel like (54:37 - 54:40)
that is (54:39 - 54:43)
the best way to do this and not have it (54:40 - 54:45)
in the pack but what do i know (54:43 - 54:48)
i just i feel like (54:45 - 54:51)
the tcg was getting so good at making (54:48 - 54:52)
the game a little bit quicker (54:51 - 54:55)
and a little bit more accessible and (54:52 - 54:57)
i mean this could just be a one-off a (54:55 - 54:59)
quick little thing that happens and then (54:57 - 55:02)
they're like that was fun we out (54:59 - 55:05)
yeah i mean they they came in with with (55:02 - 55:06)
the (55:05 - 55:07)
legend stuff real quick i mean all the (55:06 - 55:09)
legends was like one specific set i (55:07 - 55:11)
remember i think it was just (55:09 - 55:14)
he was just under i will say in some (55:11 - 55:16)
defense of the legends (55:14 - 55:19)
the first time you and i ever met in (55:16 - 55:19)
person (55:19 - 55:22)
either you or vinnie was playing ho-oh (55:19 - 55:23)
legend (55:22 - 55:25)
i think it was vinnie yeah okay or it (55:23 - 55:27)
might have been me i really like toto (55:25 - 55:28)
decks (55:27 - 55:30)
decks are pretty similar they're usually (55:28 - 55:31)
like (55:30 - 55:35)
play one of every energy and then (55:31 - 55:37)
revive ho-oh from the discard pile and (55:35 - 55:39)
attach the energy (55:37 - 55:42)
um i don't think it was me though i (55:39 - 55:46)
think i have played the ho'o legend but (55:42 - 55:46)
not great (55:46 - 55:52)
i like to try to give ho-oh some you (55:50 - 55:55)
know some freedom (55:52 - 55:55)
uh some pokemon go news here is there (55:57 - 56:00)
will be a (55:59 - 56:03)
free remote raid pass from break through (56:00 - 56:05)
research through all of june i don't (56:03 - 56:06)
know if we talked about that last (56:05 - 56:10)
week um also that (56:06 - 56:12)
ho a speaking of ho oh that was not (56:10 - 56:14)
meant to be a transition but ho-oh will (56:12 - 56:15)
be (56:14 - 56:18)
shadow formed from giovanni that will (56:15 - 56:19)
start thursday (56:18 - 56:22)
june 17th through wednesday september (56:19 - 56:23)
1st (56:22 - 56:25)
if you complete the latest team rock go (56:23 - 56:28)
rocket special research (56:25 - 56:29)
you will get the super rocket radar (56:28 - 56:31)
which will let you track down giovanni (56:29 - 56:32)
which will let you get (56:31 - 56:37)
shadow ho oh and if you want (56:32 - 56:37)
not ho-oh you have until june 17th (56:38 - 56:46)
to do zapdos from giovanni (56:41 - 56:46)
i mean and you're gonna save your (56:49 - 56:56)
shadow ho oh and purify them so that you (56:53 - 56:57)
unlock their hearts so they're not (56:56 - 56:59)
tortured forever (56:57 - 57:02)
right and they're worth (56:59 - 57:05)
better if they're they don't they're mad (57:02 - 57:06)
and angry (57:05 - 57:08)
how is that better for their mental (57:06 - 57:10)
well-being (57:08 - 57:12)
this is about financial not about the (57:10 - 57:14)
actual pokemon itself (57:12 - 57:16)
and if i could sell a shadow ho-oh for (57:14 - 57:18)
more than i could sell a purified ho-oh (57:16 - 57:20)
you know where my dollar is gonna go (57:18 - 57:22)
yeah (57:20 - 57:22)
valid (57:25 - 57:28)
did you guys finish your slow poke event (57:31 - 57:35)
there was a slow poke event (57:33 - 57:38)
oh my gosh are you ready (57:35 - 57:42)
are you ready i'm ready i actually did (57:38 - 57:45)
it was probably the easiest one that (57:42 - 57:46)
they've done yeah and it had a cute (57:45 - 57:48)
shirt the cute shirt (57:46 - 57:52)
sold me uh also the fact that (57:48 - 57:55)
galerion slowpoke was in raids and (57:52 - 57:57)
there's one that popped like (57:55 - 58:00)
close to my house and i just did it and (57:57 - 58:01)
it was like (58:00 - 58:04)
i uh (58:01 - 58:08)
i guess i could evolve a slow bro and a (58:04 - 58:08)
slow (58:08 - 58:11)
king yeah i've not seen galerion (58:08 - 58:14)
slowpoke (58:11 - 58:14)
so it's only in raids or (58:14 - 58:19)
through special research right although (58:18 - 58:21)
there is a i mean i could leave right (58:19 - 58:23)
now because there's a slow bro (58:21 - 58:27)
down the street the gallerian one (58:23 - 58:30)
no they don't spawn a while yeah oh slow (58:27 - 58:31)
bro slow bro (58:30 - 58:33)
i thought you don't you have to evolve (58:31 - 58:35)
it isn't that what the (58:33 - 58:37)
sign is you have to evolve it which is (58:35 - 58:38)
kind of silly because if you just catch (58:37 - 58:41)
a wild slope bro it doesn't count (58:38 - 58:41)
i may not have enough slowpoke to (58:42 - 58:49)
oh yeah i do i just cleaned all these (58:46 - 58:52)
out what what up (58:49 - 58:52)
uh niantic also announced that the next (58:53 - 58:57)

the month (59:29 - 59:33)
oh yeah the two we don't know for sure (59:30 - 59:34)
we just suspect that it's what we (59:33 - 59:35)
suspect (59:34 - 59:38)
there's no way it's not be doof (59:35 - 59:38)
has to be bedif (59:40 - 59:43)
is this today because i'm going to skip (59:44 - 59:49)
that thing (59:47 - 59:52)
no because they that that thing was like (59:49 - 59:53)
three days (59:52 - 59:55)
look greg yeah we don't we don't skip (59:53 - 59:56)
community days (59:55 - 60:00)
but we determine listen we determine (59:56 - 60:02)
a level of effort in business we call (60:00 - 60:04)
this l-o-e (60:02 - 60:07)
if it's a really good i i don't want to (60:04 - 60:09)
say gibble's a really good community day (60:07 - 60:10)
but (60:09 - 60:13)
whatever if steve's coming out (60:10 - 60:17)
we go we do the walk we effort (60:13 - 60:21)
if it's badoof community day (60:17 - 60:24)
you and i will meet up at a diner we'll (60:21 - 60:25)
sit at the table (60:24 - 60:27)
we'll eat a burger we'll poke at our (60:25 - 60:29)
screen yeah i'll we'll get an incense (60:27 - 60:32)
going we'll get a lure going and (60:29 - 60:34)
works for me the level of effort will be (60:32 - 60:35)
much lower (60:34 - 60:39)
balls in your cart pokemon go (60:35 - 60:39)
the the pokemon go (60:40 - 60:46)
kovid rewards are like slowly ending i (60:43 - 60:47)
think they only have like (60:46 - 60:48)
20 some days left you can check in the (60:47 - 60:50)
app i don't (60:48 - 60:52)
know off the top of my head but i'd be (60:50 - 60:56)
curious what their (60:52 - 60:59)
be curious not like them renewing it but (60:56 - 61:00)
what is sticking around and what's not (60:59 - 61:01)
yeah (61:00 - 61:03)
like are they going to add the walking (61:01 - 61:05)
to gbl are they going to (61:03 - 61:08)
um 16 days left 20 hours (61:05 - 61:10)
so the special bonuses right now are you (61:08 - 61:13)
can open 1.5 as many gifts (61:10 - 61:15)
so i think you can open 30 instead of (61:13 - 61:17)
12. i can't wait for that to go away i'm (61:15 - 61:19)
so tired of sitting there every morning (61:17 - 61:21)
and opening so many gifts (61:19 - 61:23)
let me hit my limit and free me from (61:21 - 61:24)
this despair (61:23 - 61:27)
no more walking for go battle league (61:24 - 61:29)
boosted damage for traders battling in (61:27 - 61:31)
remote raids (61:29 - 61:35)
twice the effectiveness of incense (61:31 - 61:37)
buddies will bring you items more often (61:35 - 61:38)
and i think there was that huge (61:37 - 61:41)
like upset where they got rid of the (61:38 - 61:42)
what was it half egg (61:41 - 61:45)
yeah and then there was like some other (61:42 - 61:46)
things (61:45 - 61:49)
um i don't know i think for i think the (61:46 - 61:50)
biggest thing here is probably the go (61:49 - 61:51)
battle league stuff i don't (61:50 - 61:54)
do go battle league but i would imagine (61:51 - 61:55)
those people would probably be very (61:54 - 61:57)
upset if they had to start walking (61:55 - 61:59)
um the other stuff i think the only (61:57 - 62:00)
thing i really care about is like the (61:59 - 62:01)
twice (62:00 - 62:03)
incense effectiveness like i think (62:01 - 62:05)
incense are in a really good place right (62:03 - 62:08)
now and because they cost money (62:05 - 62:12)
i feel like they were not worth the (62:08 - 62:13)
price you were paying (62:12 - 62:15)
yeah and i feel like they now are worth (62:13 - 62:18)
the price you are paying (62:15 - 62:21)
true agree i mean my pokemon go now that (62:18 - 62:22)
i'm (62:21 - 62:24)
permanently working from home my pokemon (62:22 - 62:26)
go everything will be suffered (62:24 - 62:29)
because i don't have easy walk routes (62:26 - 62:30)
anymore (62:29 - 62:33)
i like the winter months i'm not (62:30 - 62:36)
walking around my frigid neighborhood (62:33 - 62:38)
i don't have a downtown office where i (62:36 - 62:40)
can walk indoors and have a (62:38 - 62:42)
million stops by me it's time to get a (62:40 - 62:45)
north face jacket (62:42 - 62:45)
then you can walk in the cold no then (62:47 - 62:51)
you get a canada goose jacket (62:50 - 62:54)
yeah yeah for the cold but i'm also not (62:51 - 62:56)
doing that either (62:54 - 62:57)
because that what i'm gonna do with my (62:56 - 62:59)
hands let my hands freeze off use those (62:57 - 63:02)
bad touch gloves that are always bad (62:59 - 63:06)
that they don't save my hands or do i (63:02 - 63:06)
walk (63:06 - 63:08)
do i drive around like i did last (63:06 - 63:10)
december getting deforded like a creeper (63:08 - 63:12)
parking my car in people's neighborhoods (63:10 - 63:13)
and i get reported (63:12 - 63:16)
do what i do set your poke ball plus to (63:13 - 63:18)
auto capture (63:16 - 63:21)
uh with your zip tie wrapped around (63:18 - 63:23)
that look i got just as many shinies as (63:21 - 63:24)
you did (63:23 - 63:28)
so with a lot less uh finger friction (63:24 - 63:30)
little that's true but i wasn't aiming (63:28 - 63:31)
for shinies i was aiming for those (63:30 - 63:33)
excellent curves because you get the (63:31 - 63:35)
three times the xp (63:33 - 63:38)
who did what gotta get to 50. (63:35 - 63:41)
that's where the real game there is no (63:38 - 63:42)
real game at 50. (63:41 - 63:45)
this is the false i'm once again here to (63:42 - 63:46)
tell you (63:45 - 63:48)
play the game at your own pace do not (63:46 - 63:50)
buy into their false stereotypes i (63:48 - 63:51)
didn't tell people to rush (63:50 - 63:54)
i'm just saying i need to get to 50 i (63:51 - 63:56)
didn't say game gobbler (63:54 - 63:58)
oh i'm so sad snap is gone but i'm gonna (63:56 - 64:01)
gobble my way to 50 and go (63:58 - 64:04)
hey go is go is providing for me (64:01 - 64:08)
[Laughter] (64:04 - 64:14)
it's true (64:08 - 64:14)

that exists or has yet to exist (64:45 - 64:51)
well i would say if they're saying your (64:49 - 64:54)
favorite i would assume it would have to (64:51 - 64:55)
exist (64:54 - 64:57)
i mean i could have a favorite that (64:55 - 64:59)
doesn't exist yet (64:57 - 65:01)

option at the start of the game (70:30 - 70:34)
to make it harder or for more (70:32 - 70:36)
experienced players or to keep it easy (70:34 - 70:38)
for new or younger players for example (70:36 - 70:38)

question on the youtube and have a (70:41 - 70:44)
prepared response (70:43 - 70:47)
oh go really yeah it's called they did (70:44 - 70:48)
it before (70:47 - 70:51)
nobody cared they stopped doing it well (70:48 - 70:53)
they did it before but it was post game (70:51 - 70:55)
it was bad it was weird and it was badly (70:53 - 70:56)
implemented (70:55 - 70:58)
oh it was real bad because it was like (70:56 - 71:00)
in one of the games you could switch to (70:58 - 71:00)
easy mode (71:00 - 71:02)
in the other games you could switch to (71:00 - 71:04)
heart no no you could you could (71:02 - 71:05)
technically have them in (71:04 - 71:08)
both you had to exchange keys yeah your (71:05 - 71:09)
friends (71:08 - 71:11)
so like if you had okay let's just (71:09 - 71:12)
explain this real quick (71:11 - 71:16)
in pokemon black 2 and white 2 there was (71:12 - 71:16)
an (71:16 - 71:19)
easy normal and hard and (71:16 - 71:21)
if you played white 2 when you got to (71:19 - 71:22)
the end (71:21 - 71:25)
you got a key which you could send to (71:22 - 71:28)
another game as many games as you wanted (71:25 - 71:30)
and that would unlock the easy mode for (71:28 - 71:32)
that player and if you beat black too (71:30 - 71:37)
and you got the hard key so (71:32 - 71:40)
if greg played black and will played (71:37 - 71:41)
white (71:40 - 71:43)
and i was the new player they could send (71:41 - 71:46)
me both keys in my copy regardless of if (71:43 - 71:48)
i have white or black (71:46 - 71:50)
too and then when i start the game i (71:48 - 71:51)
would have easy (71:50 - 71:54)
normal and hard but it was dumb (71:51 - 71:57)
because of what i just laid out you had (71:54 - 71:58)
to get through the game (71:57 - 72:01)
and do it as somebody who has played (71:58 - 72:02)
through the (72:01 - 72:06)
hard mode of pokemon gym leaders all had (72:02 - 72:07)
one extra pokemon (72:06 - 72:10)
um the gym leaders were like (72:07 - 72:12)
four levels above what they normally (72:10 - 72:14)
were like i think charon (72:12 - 72:15)
who's the first gym leader in black 2 (72:14 - 72:18)
spoiler he's normally like i think he's (72:15 - 72:18)
normally (72:18 - 72:21)
level 10 and level 12 and then in hard (72:18 - 72:22)
mode he's like level 14 (72:21 - 72:26)
and level 16. um and normally they (72:22 - 72:28)
they're not only would the pokemon be (72:26 - 72:29)
higher levels is the pokemon would have (72:28 - 72:31)
like a slightly different moveset (72:29 - 72:34)
and then i think for charon he had a (72:31 - 72:37)
third pokemon instead of the two and (72:34 - 72:40)
that was kind of how the whole game went (72:37 - 72:42)
in (72:40 - 72:43)
i think and this is what i've always (72:42 - 72:44)
said i think this is the fundamental (72:43 - 72:46)
problem with pokemon (72:44 - 72:49)
is is as somebody who has played more (72:46 - 72:50)
than one pokemon game i (72:49 - 72:53)
understand the world of pokemon so by (72:50 - 72:55)
you giving the gym leader an extra (72:53 - 72:57)
pokemon and making them slightly harder (72:55 - 72:58)
all you're doing is you're telling me i (72:57 - 73:00)
need to spend more time knocking out (72:58 - 73:05)
audino before i battle that gym leader (73:00 - 73:09)
um i i get i think it would be (73:05 - 73:12)
depend on how they implement (73:09 - 73:15)
the various modes it could be fun but (73:12 - 73:16)
they'd have to implement it (73:15 - 73:19)
in a way that hard mode isn't just grind (73:16 - 73:20)
more (73:19 - 73:22)
right and that's what i felt yeah for (73:20 - 73:24)
black too is i just felt like i was (73:22 - 73:25)
grinding audino a little bit more (73:24 - 73:27)
i didn't feel like it was like much (73:25 - 73:29)
harder if hard mode (73:27 - 73:32)
had a cap like (73:29 - 73:34)
when you went into the gym if you went (73:32 - 73:36)
over the gym's level it said you cannot (73:34 - 73:39)
bring these pokemon into this gym (73:36 - 73:40)
like things like that that would (73:39 - 73:43)
actually make actually make it a hard (73:40 - 73:44)
mode (73:43 - 73:45)
something that you couldn't power (73:44 - 73:47)
through i could see that being (73:45 - 73:49)
implemented but if it's (73:47 - 73:50)
i mean what generally happens in (73:49 - 73:52)
turn-based games (73:50 - 73:54)
is hard mode is i'm just going to grind (73:52 - 73:56)
my levels above well yeah (73:54 - 73:58)
the answer to most everything in pokemon (73:56 - 74:00)
is grind more yeah (73:58 - 74:04)
and that's not that's not necessarily (74:00 - 74:07)
more fun well and i would say i think (74:04 - 74:09)
just looking at the history of video (74:07 - 74:10)
games (74:09 - 74:14)
where a long time ago almost (74:10 - 74:16)
every game you started out by saying i (74:14 - 74:17)
want (74:16 - 74:20)
easy normal hard murder me (74:17 - 74:22)
you know look at the starting menu for (74:20 - 74:25)
doom right doom came out in 94 95 (74:22 - 74:27)
something like that same time as pokemon (74:25 - 74:31)
but the the thing was (74:27 - 74:34)
the increasing intensity of those hard (74:31 - 74:35)
modes in those games (74:34 - 74:40)
was make the opponents have more health (74:35 - 74:43)
reduce the spawn of bullets don't (74:40 - 74:46)
allow the player to regen three (74:43 - 74:48)
relatively (74:46 - 74:50)
simple things to implement it's just (74:48 - 74:52)
like you hit those fields like (74:50 - 74:55)
you know x times the health of any (74:52 - 74:56)
opponent np (74:55 - 74:57)
or whatever thing that you have to (74:56 - 74:59)
defeat uh (74:57 - 75:01)
divide by four the number of health (74:59 - 75:03)
packs you'll find as pickups you know (75:01 - 75:03)
the number of (75:03 - 75:06)
bullets you'll find as pickups and you (75:03 - 75:07)
know no regen (75:06 - 75:09)
if you die you restart the level or (75:07 - 75:10)
restart the game turn it into a (75:09 - 75:12)
roguelike whatever (75:10 - 75:16)
but if you were to do that in pokemon (75:12 - 75:19)
it just it wouldn't it wouldn't make it (75:16 - 75:19)
any (75:19 - 75:21)
harder experience it would make it a (75:19 - 75:22)
better experience right because it's (75:21 - 75:23)
it's not like (75:22 - 75:26)
i have to think harder it's once again i (75:23 - 75:28)
have to grind more (75:26 - 75:31)
so because technically like there's an (75:28 - 75:33)
infinite supply (75:31 - 75:36)
of supply items you know yeah (75:33 - 75:38)
just as long as you're patient enough (75:36 - 75:40)
and willing to grind them out (75:38 - 75:42)
so like limiting the number of drops it (75:40 - 75:44)
doesn't (75:42 - 75:47)
doesn't exist i think my problem with (75:44 - 75:49)
this is like i get it they're they're (75:47 - 75:50)
like really hard (75:49 - 75:53)
rom or fan made games and they're like (75:50 - 75:54)
designed to be that way (75:53 - 75:56)
and they're designed to be very specific (75:54 - 75:58)
in the sense of like (75:56 - 76:01)
the person who made them curated the gym (75:58 - 76:04)
leader to cover their bases (76:01 - 76:06)
um and they end up being like very (76:04 - 76:08)
tedious (76:06 - 76:10)
um but on top of that the person is also (76:08 - 76:13)
usually doing some sort of nuzlocke (76:10 - 76:16)
where if their pokemon dies they (76:13 - 76:19)
or faints they don't use it anymore and (76:16 - 76:23)
if that if that one rule wasn't there (76:19 - 76:26)
those fan-made games wouldn't be as hard (76:23 - 76:26)
as they are (76:26 - 76:28)
right because you're thinking in a (76:26 - 76:30)
different way of like well if (76:28 - 76:33)
if he dies and then this steamrolls and (76:30 - 76:35)
then i have to go back and regrind but i (76:33 - 76:37)
can't have him die because i need him (76:35 - 76:38)
for the next gym leader (76:37 - 76:41)
like it that that one rule of like (76:38 - 76:43)
if my pokemon faints i can't use them (76:41 - 76:45)
again changes (76:43 - 76:47)
well so much of your thought process in (76:45 - 76:48)
a battle (76:47 - 76:50)
the other rule is you can only catch one (76:48 - 76:52)
thing on a route you are artificially (76:50 - 76:54)
limiting how many pokemon you have (76:52 - 76:57)
how many you can catch and (76:54 - 76:59)
if you can use them past so the (76:57 - 77:01)
difficulty comes in that you have a (76:59 - 77:05)
much smaller and less ideal sometimes (77:01 - 77:07)
pool of pokemon because it's the first (77:05 - 77:08)
one you get on the route and it could be (77:07 - 77:12)
a caterpie or it could be a (77:08 - 77:15)
low tad yeah not the one percent that (77:12 - 77:19)
rare spawn that might be better i mean (77:15 - 77:20)
there are ways to (77:19 - 77:22)
implement that in the game i think that (77:20 - 77:24)
is (77:22 - 77:24)
a mode a very (77:26 - 77:31)
small percentage of people would (77:29 - 77:34)
actually want to play and not be worth (77:31 - 77:36)
coding and making in the game uh here's (77:34 - 77:37)
the answer (77:36 - 77:40)
pokemon hard mode every gym leader every (77:37 - 77:41)
gym (77:40 - 77:44)
whitney's miltank no wait (77:41 - 77:47)
pokemon easy mode (77:44 - 77:51)
every gym every gym leader is a bug gym (77:47 - 77:52)
literally just bring geodude and you'll (77:51 - 77:54)
be fine against whitney's miltank (77:52 - 77:58)
um i think there is room for like a (77:54 - 78:00)
first time playing pokemon and a expert (77:58 - 78:01)
playing pokemon i think there's a (78:00 - 78:02)
hundred percent that (78:01 - 78:06)
that like that somewhere that fits of (78:02 - 78:09)
maybe you (78:06 - 78:11)
not necessarily speed up the game but (78:09 - 78:12)
maybe you don't have to teach these (78:11 - 78:13)
mechanics (78:12 - 78:16)
but they're i think if anything maybe (78:13 - 78:17)
not a hard mode but they're (78:16 - 78:21)
i feel like maybe there needs to be (78:17 - 78:22)
this is so hard because people learn (78:21 - 78:24)
differently yeah (78:22 - 78:27)
like an easy like there's i i still (78:24 - 78:29)
cannot imagine somebody who's never (78:27 - 78:30)
played a pokemon game (78:29 - 78:32)
it's their first pokemon game and you (78:30 - 78:34)
drop them in there's 400 pokemon (78:32 - 78:36)
there's all these moves what do these (78:34 - 78:39)
moves do what are these priority levels (78:36 - 78:41)
what resist what what type is super (78:39 - 78:44)
effective there is a lot to learn (78:41 - 78:47)
all these held items and evs ivs (78:44 - 78:50)
and almost all that stuff you can ignore (78:47 - 78:51)
like you can go through an entire (78:50 - 78:52)
pokemon game never (78:51 - 78:55)
hear the term evs ivs never care about (78:52 - 78:56)
nature (78:55 - 78:58)
never equip the held item and you can do (78:56 - 78:59)
it and i think that (78:58 - 79:02)
is so important for a person to (78:59 - 79:05)
experience but i do think there there (79:02 - 79:08)
could be a slightly (79:05 - 79:09)
hard more difficult mode more (79:08 - 79:11)
challenging mode where (79:09 - 79:13)
maybe you do have to have held items or (79:11 - 79:15)
at least equipped mystic water or at (79:13 - 79:16)
least equip (79:15 - 79:20)
charcoal or at least maybe um (79:16 - 79:23)
use a tm but that prevents like nothing (79:20 - 79:25)
is stopping a player from over leveling (79:23 - 79:28)
right uh unless you the the way you (79:25 - 79:30)
prevent that is you walk into (79:28 - 79:31)
like the battle tower you walk into a (79:30 - 79:34)
gym yeah if your pokemon's 15 it brings (79:31 - 79:36)
it down to 14 because that's fair (79:34 - 79:37)
but these are all things you can do (79:36 - 79:39)
yourself right like if you wanted the (79:37 - 79:41)
game to be harder (79:39 - 79:43)
so this is my the funny thing i always (79:41 - 79:44)
think of is when (79:43 - 79:46)
somebody goes a pokemon game is too easy (79:44 - 79:48)
and this is how they play (79:46 - 79:50)
they walk into a gym they battle the (79:48 - 79:52)
dude first dude they then leave the gym (79:50 - 79:55)
heal go back into the gym battle the (79:52 - 79:55)
second dude (79:55 - 79:58)
leave the gym heal go back into the gym (79:55 - 79:59)
battle the third dude (79:58 - 80:01)
leave heal and then they save in front (79:59 - 80:03)
of the gym leader after fully healed and (80:01 - 80:04)
they they start the game and then they (80:03 - 80:06)
complain that the game is too (80:04 - 80:09)
easy you made that conscious conscious (80:06 - 80:10)
choice (80:09 - 80:13)
to do that um like if you wanted the (80:10 - 80:14)
game to be (80:13 - 80:16)
harder if that's your complaint if it's (80:14 - 80:18)
too easy like i don't care i do that too (80:16 - 80:19)
because i just (80:18 - 80:22)
it's just tedious to not do it um but if (80:19 - 80:24)
i wanted to be challenged (80:22 - 80:27)
try going like try going through the gym (80:24 - 80:29)
without healing at all (80:27 - 80:31)
is it harder probably is it as hard as (80:29 - 80:32)
you want maybe not (80:31 - 80:36)
but that was your choice um (80:32 - 80:40)
and if you are battling a gym leader (80:36 - 80:42)
and you decide to use a potion and then (80:40 - 80:43)
use a potion (80:42 - 80:44)
and then you're like ah he only has like (80:43 - 80:47)
eight more of these hydro pumps left (80:44 - 80:48)
that's not true hydro pump only has five (80:47 - 80:50)
he only has three more of these (80:48 - 80:50)
hydroponics (80:50 - 80:54)
what if you use pp max or ppm um (80:50 - 80:56)
and you like there are so many things (80:54 - 80:58)
you can do as a player (80:56 - 81:00)
to control your experience and i think (80:58 - 81:01)
that's (81:00 - 81:03)
i think that's a great part of the (81:01 - 81:05)
pokemon games like you choose (81:03 - 81:08)
which pokemon you want you chose to pick (81:05 - 81:10)
dragon knight you could have chose (81:08 - 81:11)
dunsparce (81:10 - 81:15)
um you chose to use those potions (81:11 - 81:17)
you chose to go into the gym leader with (81:15 - 81:18)
six pokemon you could have went in with (81:17 - 81:20)
three if you wanted to be like the anime (81:18 - 81:22)
they have three you have three (81:20 - 81:26)
um you can even make it so easy (81:22 - 81:29)
if you wanted to like i would say most (81:26 - 81:30)
people (81:29 - 81:31)
maybe don't change their team a lot (81:30 - 81:34)
right they they get six pretty early on (81:31 - 81:35)
they usually keep with the six maybe (81:34 - 81:37)
they change one or two (81:35 - 81:39)
but i feel like it's very rare that a (81:37 - 81:40)
player gets to the elite four (81:39 - 81:43)
with like 30 different pokemon that they (81:40 - 81:44)
can pick from (81:43 - 81:47)
usually it's like six maybe eight or (81:44 - 81:47)
nine (81:47 - 81:49)
but like most people just gravitate (81:47 - 81:51)
towards a team and use that team through (81:49 - 81:53)
the whole game (81:51 - 81:56)
but no one is stopping you from walking (81:53 - 81:58)
into blaine with six (81:56 - 82:00)
water pokemon no one is stopping you (81:58 - 82:01)
from going into (82:00 - 82:04)
valerie with nothing but steel pokemon (82:01 - 82:05)
right (82:04 - 82:08)
like again those are choices you as a (82:05 - 82:09)
player can make and i think that's (82:08 - 82:12)
so great in a pokemon game that's not (82:09 - 82:14)
saying that there shouldn't be like (82:12 - 82:17)
hey look i've played like seven of these (82:14 - 82:18)
can we at least (82:17 - 82:20)
mix it up like i think that that would (82:18 - 82:21)
be valid (82:20 - 82:24)
um but i don't know if like (82:21 - 82:26)
them dedicating time to like this (82:24 - 82:28)
curated hard mode is (82:26 - 82:30)
is really worth it for the amount of (82:28 - 82:31)
players (82:30 - 82:34)
or even a curated easy mode because i i (82:31 - 82:36)
i think it's hard to define (82:34 - 82:38)
out amongst a large populace in a large (82:36 - 82:40)
way that people play (82:38 - 82:45)
what's easy what's average standard (82:40 - 82:49)
and what's hard like (82:45 - 82:51)
there are a lot of variables there that (82:49 - 82:52)
i just don't (82:51 - 82:54)
yeah i mean i i know that that's uh (82:52 - 82:56)
that's the thing that (82:54 - 83:00)
we need like i would i would use my wife (82:56 - 83:01)
as an example you know she's played (83:00 - 83:02)
through all of sun and moon all of (83:01 - 83:04)
x and y all of ultrasonic moon all of (83:02 - 83:06)
ruby and sapphire as a kid like she's (83:04 - 83:08)
played through quite a bit of pokemon (83:06 - 83:08)
games but (83:08 - 83:11)
she doesn't she doesn't know like (83:08 - 83:13)
i i would probably say hey what type is (83:11 - 83:16)
mega altaria she probably doesn't know (83:13 - 83:17)
right like she's not an expert i don't (83:16 - 83:19)
think she's ever equipped in held items (83:17 - 83:20)
or anything like that and i remember (83:19 - 83:22)
watching her go through (83:20 - 83:24)
sword and shield and she struggled with (83:22 - 83:26)
uh kabu (83:24 - 83:29)
kabu the fire type and she lost to him (83:26 - 83:31)
like three times in a row (83:29 - 83:33)
and i was like you realize that his (83:31 - 83:35)
pattern is just (83:33 - 83:38)
willow wisp attack willowis attack (83:35 - 83:41)
and once i pointed that out she beat him (83:38 - 83:42)
and she never lost another battle in (83:41 - 83:44)
that entire game she lost to kabu three (83:42 - 83:45)
times (83:44 - 83:48)
never lost another battle and she said (83:45 - 83:51)
yeah that game was pretty easy like what (83:48 - 83:51)
is defining (83:51 - 83:54)
hard like if you like who like at what (83:51 - 83:55)
point (83:54 - 83:57)
how many battles do you have to lose in (83:55 - 83:58)
a pokemon game to be like that was hard (83:57 - 83:59)
because i think like (83:58 - 84:01)
you getting stuck at one gym leader or (83:59 - 84:03)
what what some people did they got stuck (84:01 - 84:05)
at ultra necrozma (84:03 - 84:09)
yeah like that fight was hard or maybe (84:05 - 84:11)
challenging but was the game hard it was (84:09 - 84:13)
like oh no i just didn't have the right (84:11 - 84:14)
pokemon and i was just gonna try to (84:13 - 84:16)
brute force it and you know no big deal (84:14 - 84:18)
once i got past that everything else was (84:16 - 84:20)
fine like it's really hard to like (84:18 - 84:24)
at what point are you like oh kabu was (84:20 - 84:25)
too hard i'm done with the whole game (84:24 - 84:26)
like i don't know if that happens with a (84:25 - 84:28)
lot of people (84:26 - 84:32)
i mean yeah and (84:28 - 84:34)
when you're dealing with an all ages (84:32 - 84:35)
game (84:34 - 84:39)
like every (84:35 - 84:41)
every age group is going to have a (84:39 - 84:43)
different definition of easy and hard (84:41 - 84:46)
i think (84:43 - 84:46)
i think i i almost prefer (84:48 - 84:54)
it now where the difficulty comes in (84:51 - 84:56)
making your own rules and how you want (84:54 - 84:59)
to approach the game and (84:56 - 85:03)
having them focus on a much better (84:59 - 85:06)
experience uh one (85:03 - 85:08)
good experience for everybody at every (85:06 - 85:09)
level (85:08 - 85:13)
um i i i do think (85:09 - 85:16)
it's tough because it's like should this (85:13 - 85:19)
be so hand-holdy and it's like (85:16 - 85:22)
hand-holding is is in the eye above of (85:19 - 85:23)
the beholder and how much you're gonna (85:22 - 85:24)
take it like (85:23 - 85:26)
i was watching somebody play diamond and (85:24 - 85:27)
pearl again (85:26 - 85:31)
and i forgot diamond and pearl how (85:27 - 85:34)
incredibly long that opening (85:31 - 85:37)
whole thing is before you even get (85:34 - 85:39)
taught how to catch (85:37 - 85:41)
if you thought ultra sun ultra moon sun (85:39 - 85:42)
and moon had a (85:41 - 85:45)
like long opening whew i feel like you (85:42 - 85:47)
are forgetting about it (85:45 - 85:49)
i mean i had forgotten how bad diamond (85:47 - 85:51)
in pearl was for the whole beginning and (85:49 - 85:53)
i'm like was watching somebody play it (85:51 - 85:54)
and i'm like (85:53 - 85:57)
this is abysmal (85:54 - 86:01)
this is so frustratingly (85:57 - 86:04)
long like you have to go back and forth (86:01 - 86:05)
and back and forth before you get to (86:04 - 86:06)
actually do anything (86:05 - 86:08)
important in the game yeah it's just (86:06 - 86:12)
mind-boggling establish that story (86:08 - 86:14)
they really hit you hard with it up (86:12 - 86:15)
front so (86:14 - 86:18)
it's amazing how much nothing they say (86:15 - 86:19)
in the beginning (86:18 - 86:20)
too i mean because i think they tried to (86:19 - 86:23)
do tgtv right (86:20 - 86:25)
and i don't know what the adoption rate (86:23 - 86:27)
of people actually looking at tgtv was (86:25 - 86:30)
very little i don't play pokemon games (86:27 - 86:32)
to watch tv (86:30 - 86:35)
not with that dude it's a good question (86:32 - 86:36)
though like i think there is (86:35 - 86:40)
room for i've new to this game or i've (86:36 - 86:41)
played this game (86:40 - 86:43)
right well i think what it really (86:41 - 86:45)
fundamentally comes down to (86:43 - 86:48)
without doing a complete (86:45 - 86:49)
reconceptualization (86:48 - 86:52)
of what it means to be a pokemon game is (86:49 - 86:54)
you have to deal with what we call (86:52 - 86:56)
leatherman's law right (86:54 - 86:59)
leatherman's law is uh no (86:56 - 87:02)
the pokemon games have not gotten easier (86:59 - 87:04)
you just grew up just (87:02 - 87:07)
grew up right this is well established (87:04 - 87:09)
this is my number one law in the (87:07 - 87:12)
universe universities (87:09 - 87:14)
pokemon games didn't get worse you just (87:12 - 87:15)
grew up that (87:14 - 87:17)
like there's there's literally nothing (87:15 - 87:19)
that i think the pokemon company can do (87:17 - 87:20)
without (87:19 - 87:23)
deeply re-conceptualizing like (87:20 - 87:25)
re-conceptual like i (87:23 - 87:27)
forget it that's far too many battles i (87:25 - 87:28)
still have my retainer right (87:27 - 87:31)
so in order to increase the difficulty (87:28 - 87:33)
you have to make those choices yourself (87:31 - 87:35)
what do i want to do and how i approach (87:33 - 87:37)
this game to make it more (87:35 - 87:39)
of a difficult game for me and challenge (87:37 - 87:40)
myself (87:39 - 87:42)
i was visiting my friend this is my last (87:40 - 87:44)
point because i think i think this (87:42 - 87:47)
i think this goes that friend me no i (87:44 - 87:49)
was visiting my friend aaron (87:47 - 87:50)
you have too many friends more than more (87:49 - 87:51)
than two friends you're gonna start (87:50 - 87:53)
having smash brothers probably if you've (87:51 - 87:54)
listened to this podcast for 10 plus (87:53 - 87:56)
years aaron was (87:54 - 87:59)
on the show back in the day he was the (87:56 - 88:01)
main person that i was the one that i (87:59 - 88:04)
we woke up at 8am we went to gamestop (88:01 - 88:06)
we picked up heart gold soul silver we (88:04 - 88:08)
watched documentaries and we played all (88:06 - 88:10)
weekend (88:08 - 88:11)
what documentaries did you watch uh we (88:10 - 88:13)
know like uh (88:11 - 88:15)
the the fast food one the ken burns (88:13 - 88:17)
stuff baseball civil war (88:15 - 88:20)
yeah or civil war and pokemon the tried (88:17 - 88:21)
and true (88:20 - 88:23)
have you met her in chuckles whatever (88:21 - 88:25)
documentaries existed in 2010 that's (88:23 - 88:26)
what we were watching (88:25 - 88:29)
okay um super size me was probably one (88:26 - 88:31)
of them (88:29 - 88:34)
so he's been playing like he he (88:31 - 88:36)
he was like me same age grew up with red (88:34 - 88:38)
and blue played almost all of them maybe (88:36 - 88:39)
skipped ruby and sapphire (88:38 - 88:41)
was really excited to get back into (88:39 - 88:43)
hardcore soul silver (88:41 - 88:45)
we bought black and white on release day (88:43 - 88:46)
and i went to (88:45 - 88:48)
and he he skipped sun and moon he (88:46 - 88:49)
skipped ultra sun and moon he like (88:48 - 88:50)
bought x and y (88:49 - 88:52)
barely played it but sword and shield (88:50 - 88:56)
was like he's back (88:52 - 88:58)
when sword and shield came out he he got (88:56 - 89:00)
up to (88:58 - 89:03)
the right before the fairy gym (89:00 - 89:05)
um and then stopped playing right before (89:03 - 89:07)
opal (89:05 - 89:09)
and so when i visited him he was like oh (89:07 - 89:12)
you're here i should play pokemon (89:09 - 89:15)
um yeah i mean whatever man like if (89:12 - 89:16)
you're gonna play like i would love to (89:15 - 89:17)
watch you play pokemon like that's (89:16 - 89:19)
what always happens when i hang out with (89:17 - 89:21)
aaron too (89:19 - 89:22)
i don't hang out with aaron all that (89:21 - 89:24)
often so he he (89:22 - 89:26)
booted up pokemon because he was like i (89:24 - 89:28)
don't know where i left off and he was (89:26 - 89:30)
in the glimwood tangle (89:28 - 89:33)
and his team was like he had a gyarados (89:30 - 89:34)
he had like a (89:33 - 89:38)
hitmonlee or something he had his uh (89:34 - 89:41)
intellion or whatever no he had rilaboo (89:38 - 89:44)
he had like his team was appropriately (89:41 - 89:45)
leveled (89:44 - 89:48)
he had six of them uh he had like (89:45 - 89:49)
miracle seed and whatever (89:48 - 89:50)
like he had his health items and he's (89:49 - 89:52)
going through the forest and he like (89:50 - 89:55)
sees an impedemp for the first time (89:52 - 89:57)
and he like catches it and then moves on (89:55 - 90:00)
and he gets to a trainer (89:57 - 90:03)
and it's like a comfey and (90:00 - 90:07)
like a shanatic or something and he (90:03 - 90:11)
almost loses to this random trainer (90:07 - 90:13)
and he has all the right pokemon and he (90:11 - 90:14)
has the right moves and i'm just (90:13 - 90:15)
watching (90:14 - 90:17)
and he like tries to use crunch on like (90:15 - 90:19)
the comfe and it's not super effective (90:17 - 90:20)
and stuff (90:19 - 90:23)
and that that i think is always (90:20 - 90:24)
forgotten about people that ask these (90:23 - 90:25)
questions (90:24 - 90:29)
is man i want pokemon to be harder (90:25 - 90:32)
but like you know you know the answer to (90:29 - 90:33)
the puzzle (90:32 - 90:38)
and when you don't know the puzzle yet (90:33 - 90:39)
when you don't know the answer to the (90:38 - 90:41)
puzzle it's very hard like all he had to (90:39 - 90:42)
do was hit (90:41 - 90:44)
one of his other moves but he had no (90:42 - 90:45)
clue (90:44 - 90:48)
what type of pokemon this was which is (90:45 - 90:49)
an extra bit oh wait (90:48 - 90:51)
does it tell you effectiveness before it (90:49 - 90:52)
doesn't (90:51 - 90:54)
it doesn't until you until you've (90:52 - 90:56)
battled it once i think battled it once (90:54 - 90:58)
so he didn't know what was super (90:56 - 90:59)
effective he didn't know what was (90:58 - 91:00)
resisted and he (90:59 - 91:02)
kept hitting resi like he would switch (91:00 - 91:04)
he would be like he would like crunch it (91:02 - 91:06)
and be like oh that's not very effective (91:04 - 91:07)
and then he would switch to a different (91:06 - 91:09)
pokemon then he would like (91:07 - 91:11)
high jump kick it it's like oh that's (91:09 - 91:12)
also not very effective against the fair (91:11 - 91:13)
and like (91:12 - 91:15)
he was losing to this because they would (91:13 - 91:16)
like draining kiss (91:15 - 91:20)
and like just this random npc not even a (91:16 - 91:20)
gym leader (91:20 - 91:24)
took out five of his six pokemon because (91:20 - 91:26)
he just didn't know what they were weak (91:24 - 91:26)
to (91:26 - 91:30)
and i think that's that is why if you've (91:26 - 91:30)
ever (91:30 - 91:32)
played one pokemon game and you move on (91:30 - 91:35)
to a second one it is significantly (91:32 - 91:37)
easier because you start putting those (91:35 - 91:38)
pieces together (91:37 - 91:41)
and you can't unlearn that right um and (91:38 - 91:43)
that's the problem with like trying to (91:41 - 91:44)
make the game harder (91:43 - 91:47)
is that's why ultra necrozma is so was (91:44 - 91:48)
such a good fight for a lot of people (91:47 - 91:50)
because they didn't know what to do (91:48 - 91:53)
and then once once it was pointed out to (91:50 - 91:54)
them they're like oh (91:53 - 91:57)
yeah okay i just like yeah lead me me q (91:54 - 91:59)
toxic and then just like switch for five (91:57 - 92:01)
turns and it's dead like (91:59 - 92:03)
i mean which is also why i prefer to (92:01 - 92:05)
avoid spoilers right because i want any (92:03 - 92:08)
new pokemon to be new to me right even (92:05 - 92:11)
when i'm doing like a nuzlocke (92:08 - 92:12)
when i'm doing like a nuzlocke and i'm (92:11 - 92:14)
fighting a gym leader and somebody in (92:12 - 92:15)
chat (92:14 - 92:17)
is like oh by the way they have hyper (92:15 - 92:18)
beam (92:17 - 92:20)
like you've just made it significantly (92:18 - 92:22)
easier for me because now i know (92:20 - 92:24)
like this is like i'm trying to make it (92:22 - 92:26)
hard right but once you tell me their (92:24 - 92:27)
moves (92:26 - 92:29)
i can now play around that they can only (92:27 - 92:30)
have four moves (92:29 - 92:33)
right um anyways i just think that's (92:30 - 92:34)
like (92:33 - 92:36)
it's a very interesting conversation it (92:34 - 92:38)
is i i mean i i do think there are (92:36 - 92:40)
potential things they could do (92:38 - 92:41)
like to make it harder they could treat (92:40 - 92:43)
it more like you know the battle tower (92:41 - 92:45)
they could do those things (92:43 - 92:47)
i (92:45 - 92:47)
i don't know if that appeals to as (92:48 - 92:54)
big of an audiences as all the people (92:51 - 92:55)
who want it thinks it (92:54 - 92:57)
does i mean they i mean they know game (92:55 - 93:00)
freak knows how many i mean (92:57 - 93:02)
and it's probably not a lot we don't get (93:00 - 93:04)
to see those numbers (93:02 - 93:08)
um yeah battle tower is like whatever as (93:04 - 93:08)
well (93:08 - 93:11)
it's like fine yeah it's fine uh (93:08 - 93:15)
no battle subway pokemon of the week (93:11 - 93:20)
all right well it's been a week of huge (93:15 - 93:20)
disappointments (93:21 - 93:26)
i just i i can't believe (93:22 - 93:29)
uh i lay it all out for everybody on a (93:26 - 93:31)
platter (93:29 - 93:35)
and yet it's i don't know it's like (93:31 - 93:37)
the platter is in front of you and you (93:35 - 93:38)
walk over to the water fountain and then (93:37 - 93:40)
complain that you're hungry (93:38 - 93:43)
here okay i am available for (93:40 - 93:44)
consultation (93:43 - 93:47)
with with the club where available it's (93:44 - 93:47)
over (93:47 - 93:50)
it's over it's over you can reach me on (93:47 - 93:51)
twitter (93:50 - 93:53)
you can find me on slack i'm sometimes (93:51 - 93:54)
your discord (93:53 - 93:56)
your name is me mentioned several times (93:54 - 93:57)
it's true (93:56 - 93:58)
and especially after the previous week (93:57 - 94:01)
when we said no restrictions on how you (93:58 - 94:02)
find out this information kids (94:01 - 94:05)
go go right to greg if you need to so (94:02 - 94:07)
based on a sanrio character (94:05 - 94:10)
and then the key statement this week's (94:07 - 94:11)
pokemon is derived from that character (94:10 - 94:13)
you can figure it out (94:11 - 94:16)
if you rearrange the letters properly (94:13 - 94:17)
you have to remove (94:16 - 94:20)
the c and the d though and by c (94:17 - 94:24)
i mean like on the moon or around italy (94:20 - 94:27)
now boy that is just so packed with (94:24 - 94:28)
nutrition it's like omega-3 (94:27 - 94:31)
fatty acids from a fish uh (94:28 - 94:34)
for for our folks in our slack they got (94:31 - 94:35)
to read the printed copy where they (94:34 - 94:36)
could see (94:35 - 94:39)
that the word c was spelled s-e-a (94:36 - 94:44)
not the letter c um and (94:39 - 94:46)
for those maybe maybe we're learning (94:44 - 94:47)
something today but (94:46 - 94:50)
there are seas on the moon because the (94:47 - 94:51)
lava flows (94:50 - 94:53)
hardened lava flows that exist on the (94:51 - 94:55)
moon have all been given the names of (94:53 - 94:56)
seas (94:55 - 94:59)
except it's in latin so (94:56 - 95:02)
there's mari imbrium and mari (94:59 - 95:05)
tranquilly tatis and mari fakun (95:02 - 95:07)
di tati i can't pronounce these latin (95:05 - 95:09)
things (95:07 - 95:12)
but they're all maare mare means c (95:09 - 95:15)
in italian there's three seas around the (95:12 - 95:16)
italian peninsula (95:15 - 95:19)
the mari adriatica (95:16 - 95:22)
uh what's the other ones there uh (95:19 - 95:23)
mediterranean (95:22 - 95:25)
well mediterranean is not one of the (95:23 - 95:27)
three technically around (95:25 - 95:31)
the boot uh but yeah adriatic (95:27 - 95:34)
tiranian and ionian are the three around (95:31 - 95:35)
the peninsula but (95:34 - 95:37)
the word favorite yu-gi-oh character or (95:35 - 95:38)
c (95:37 - 95:41)
in italian is once again mari (95:38 - 95:44)
but here's the other trick slight thing (95:41 - 95:46)
you still could have gotten if you saw (95:44 - 95:49)
the word mari i think in front of you (95:46 - 95:52)
that sometimes in foreign languages like (95:49 - 95:55)
latin or italian if a word ends in a (95:52 - 95:57)
vowel and the next word starts in a (95:55 - 95:58)
vowel you take the vowel (95:57 - 96:01)
off the ending of the first word so you (95:58 - 96:02)
might say like (96:01 - 96:06)
mar adriatico anyways m-a-r was the part (96:02 - 96:09)
yes my favorite sanrio (96:06 - 96:14)
character is basmaru bad bat (96:09 - 96:14)
so if you take out m a r and (96:16 - 96:23)
d from batsmaru and you rearrange the (96:19 - 96:24)
letters (96:23 - 96:28)
what do you get hello kitty (96:24 - 96:33)
yeah no it's zubat (96:28 - 96:38)
the only correct answer is gudetama (96:33 - 96:41)
it's together i kind of wanted it to be (96:38 - 96:43)
together because i thought that was fun (96:41 - 96:44)
but it's (96:43 - 96:47)
zubin hmm (96:44 - 96:49)
where's the baby desperate for pokemon (96:47 - 96:51)
of the week we're relying on zubat now (96:49 - 96:54)
look zubat is my what (96:51 - 96:57)
easily one of my least favorite pokemon (96:54 - 97:02)
i like zubat i liked zubat (96:57 - 97:05)
50 caves ago it increases the difficulty (97:02 - 97:06)
level (97:05 - 97:09)
in pokemon games much in the way that (97:06 - 97:10)
cicadas (97:09 - 97:12)
ensure their reproduction through (97:10 - 97:14)
massive amounts (97:12 - 97:17)
it's got a cute shuffle icon because (97:14 - 97:20)
it's just all teeths (97:17 - 97:23)
it's got a terrible shiny i'm sorry i do (97:20 - 97:24)
not like what (97:23 - 97:27)
no other pokemon is the same type (97:24 - 97:29)
combination as zubat and its evolve (97:27 - 97:30)
forms that's actually shocking (97:29 - 97:33)
gen 1 is littered with poison types and (97:30 - 97:34)
yet (97:33 - 97:37)
there you go zubat's evolutionary family (97:34 - 97:38)
has (97:37 - 97:40)
several similarities with wubat all (97:38 - 97:42)
members are called the bat pokemon (97:40 - 97:45)
excluding subat they live in caves or (97:42 - 97:48)
dark places they have no visible eyes (97:45 - 97:52)
uh at their respective uninvolved states (97:48 - 97:54)
furthermore members of both lines (97:52 - 97:56)
respect ris (97:54 - 97:59)
respectively fully evolve of their (97:56 - 97:59)
respective (97:59 - 98:02)
fully evolved forms evolved by (97:59 - 98:03)
friendship (98:02 - 98:05)
they both have similar shiny forms with (98:03 - 98:07)
green main bodies well that's like 90 (98:05 - 98:09)
percent of pokemon (98:07 - 98:11)
zubat and mubat have similar english (98:09 - 98:12)
names both (98:11 - 98:15)
rhyming with the prefix of bat as a (98:12 - 98:18)
suffix (98:15 - 98:20)
uh zubat can seem parallel to noibat (98:18 - 98:22)
they're both flying they both are bats (98:20 - 98:24)
they both have infiltrator as an ability (98:22 - 98:26)
they also share the same base stats with (98:24 - 98:27)
the same (98:26 - 98:28)
attack and special attack switched (98:27 - 98:30)
around it's almost like there was a (98:28 - 98:30)
reason (98:30 - 98:34)
for it to be matched up with (98:30 - 98:37)
this do you think (98:34 - 98:39)
maybe (98:37 - 98:39)
yes that's fine (98:40 - 98:47)
yeah zoo that's fine that's fine that's (98:45 - 98:48)
not great i mean (98:47 - 98:51)
the shiny crowbar is like golden it's (98:48 - 98:52)
not green (98:51 - 98:55)
yeah it's like pick as quick as quick as (98:52 - 98:58)
i can get out of zubat form the happier (98:55 - 99:02)
