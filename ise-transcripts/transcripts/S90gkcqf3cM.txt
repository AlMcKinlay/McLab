[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 434th episode of i don't know why i almost lost my breath there of the pokemon podcast so that was tough it's super effective same number forward and backwards it's a real real mind twister right there i'm your host sbj with me is uh will i had prepared a very a statement uh so that i could express gratitude for our listeners and it was all about like how giving them the ability to smile and be happy is of great benefit to me in my mental health but then i got in a bad mood and decided not to do it so whatever valid greg here i am here with exciting news the national nightmare is over masterchef australia season four international changed their theme song it is finally a new song a new direction now it is not what the kids would call a bop by any stretch of the imagination the new song is not a bop you would not stand anybody singing that song but it is better it is a new direction my sanity is being restored i can listen to this theme song for the 89 episodes of season four i feel like we've turned a corner you know what actually has a good thing song what the pokemon journeys it does have a good thing i need to get in on this show journey starts today i don't know why i haven't watched it yet we don't want to be d dmc8 here you can get seven seconds of us i don't that's not none without a problem yeah that is true that is absolutely true that i'm pretty sure it's not i don't know i was trying to like as a person that has had to do this as for a lot of things there there is truth in the seven seconds i always thought that was like a urban legend no no no no that's yeah also parody is covered so you can sing a song as long as it's parody and it's fine but no also right there's performance right publication right publication right and transmission right right and you know yes greg is infringing on a performance right but that's also not dmca so there you go in my year-long master of lawyering degree i have learned the ins and outs of these things i can't wait until four lawyers that listen to the podcast write in to correct us about legal issues here look they are using 2019 legal definitions and have not spent 2020 like i have studying lawyering any opinions that they have are based on old precedent and are not part of the new wave ask lawyers do you have a degree in lawyering is that your new website ask asklawyers.com well i mean it just all goes back to the case of ariana versus mayberry yeah i mean we all learned that in school so i mean i'm sorry not milwaukee public schools but the rest of the nation knows ariana versus mayberry so absolutely we do we got a show for you guys today we have a lot of stuff off pokemon.com we have a little bit of pokemon go news um and uh there's a huge we i asked prior to the show i was like hey how do you guys feel about the new christmas stuff and then both greg and will had thoughts and i was like well now this is a segment because the pokemon company i believe released all the christmas merch planned uh the way oh no i'm sure they're saving some for december 26 because that's their that uh i think it matches everything in the the japanese pokemon center for christmas stuff which the japanese pokemon center did not sleep on getting their christmas stuff out as soon as possible it was like [Music] let's just jump into some pokemon news here first bit of news is off a website called what's on netflix we're really going to the bottom of the barrel wow have are we really that bad off it's we have to go to what's on netflix.com to make it worse the website is called what's on netflix to make it worse their their web addresses what's hyphen on hyphen netflix.com who's sitting on what's on netflix.com all one word i don't know i mean like if somebody took what's on netflix.com and you were like man i want to make a website that's like what's on netflix i feel like you could maybe i feel like you could maybe get back to the drawing board and just kind of work work work some titles here okay this is even worse i just did what's on netflix.com as one word and it directs me to the hyphenated website you have the domain for the non-hyphenated version and you went for the hyphenated version why are we reading from these people they are not trustworthy i'm only reading because they're like a lot of it's hard to mess up this news number one number two is i look the name was so good somebody is pouring their heart and soul into this website so let's give them but like you have the one that people want to type in all right all right is this about pokemon journeys part three coming to netflix on december 2020 that's that's literally the news yeah okay that's the wait that went way too fast i do who what the the next 12 episodes uh part three of pokemon journeys uh are is coming to netflix in the us because remember not every netflix provider in every country carries pokemon journeys so the next 12 episodes of pokemon journeys in the net united states netflix comes out on december 4th of the year and it didn't like the it didn't really end with a cliffhanger so it's not like yeah it's not like we're waiting on anything for in particular but i do think the tagline should be the journey starts tomorrow yeah i think we have to wait until december well i mean when you're writing a premiere website like what's on netflix sometimes you're just put you're pumping out news so fast that you don't have time to dwell on a good valid title true although i will say i've enjoyed the 24 episodes so far yeah i think uh i would say maybe just a handful of them were were kind of boring skippable yeah i mean there's not been a ton of filler but we're not they're they're they are sort of dragging these out so maybe there won't be a lot of filler because they're taking their time with it or we just haven't gotten to the fiddler things you know where ash finds another krabby and then has to be like do i keep this crabby or does that crabby go and then there's a whole episode about crabby sizes again did we ever talk about like there's like an episode that's like 98 percent go catching things it's like very early on we didn't but yes there is a filler episode where it's just like constantly flying pokeballs and for like 20 some years you i've wondered why like well ash doesn't catch a lot of pokemon but that's like kind of fine because like like that's a lot of people like some people play through a pokemon game and they run into a fur fruit and they go ah maybe next time i'm running like i'm moving i mean there are some people who play pokemon games with literally one pokemon yeah and just they never catch any ash is not one to catch every single pokemon but that's okay but then but you think of like what if there was an episode where ash catches like maybe two when ash catches one pokemon that's an episode you're like oh boy what if there was like an episode where he caught two or three and then the pokemon company was like we're gonna make an episode where go catches like 40 pokemon and then on paper you go that sounds awesome in execution that episode is kind of boring well it's just literally there's they don't have go battle ever or incredibly rarely to weaken them it's just literally go throwing balls wherever he goes he's just just like oh there's something chuck there's something chuck it's a weird episode yeah it's just i like the fact that he catches a lot i sort of wish that more often than not there was at least a little like battling to like break up the constant i'm just gonna check a pokeball and hope it catches and those pokeballs work a lot better for go than they do for anybody else oh i when i was trying to catch that calorics do i i think i went through like 40 pokeballs oh yeah i just i i literally ended up catching him in it in a in a timer ball the the saddest of all balls timer ball looks good and like clocks come out of it when you throw it that's true which makes it makes it very clear to everyone that hey i gave up trying to get this in a good ball and i got it in the timer ball did people just forget that legendaries are hard to catch like this is a very common thing i hear is like oh it's so hard to catch calorics or reggie elike the last few legendaries and games were vital to the story so they were a lot easier to catch that's yeah it was a lot easier to catch solgaleo and lunala and uh whatever it was for why but the the real deal the real scandal that you're missing here is that they gave me a master ball but but god forbid i actually ever use a master ball in a pokemon nobody ever uses master balls no because that's the highest of all shames next to using a timer ball that is the [ __ ] that is shameful like he you you always save the mask master ball for for something that you don't want to fail but with calorics you can't fail it if you knock him out he just shows back up oh i know you don't even have to battle the elite four again yeah he's right he's just like right there um well that was fun uh i want to try that again because i won't join you story wise i will still make you spend i think i spent 30 luxury balls to get into luxury ball although i was very happy spoiler spoiler spoiler that when i split the horse and calorics they were both in luxury balls oh yeah i mean this isn't a spoiler it's on pokemon's official website i mean they were both in timer balls but i was i was concerned that was going to be a shed ninja thing oh where one defaults to pokeball yeah and it wasn't and i was like yes small details nobody ever uses the master ball for anything ever no no you can use it on like you can use it nobody ever have you used we all know you used a master ball you're a fool i have literally never used a master ball in my entire pokemon career let me tell you well one of your favorite games black and white i had the master ball i was hunting for a shiny boofy on route 8 double encounter method no charm because the shiny charm didn't exist it wasn't introduced until black and black too white too and i went up and down up and down up and down 14 000 encounters 15 000 encounters 16 000 encounters looking for my boof and i found a hurtier and let me tell you i never planned on playing black and white at least that copy of that came again and heard your new roar and it knew take down and it knew a lot of things to kill itself and or forced to end that battle you better believe i threw that master ball for a shiny hurtier oh yeah yeah i didn't spend all that time for the thing to roar me away sound proof uh i'm i think i had a soundproof pokemon but then the other problem is then it starts take downing and then recoils itself there ain't no soundproof ghost pokemon that it ain't gonna it ain't gonna come through asleep it just sleeps there there were a lot of things you could have done but you took the easy way out you took the coward's way okay but what am i supposed to do with a master ball in a ten-year-old game what am i saving it for at that point leave just leave the master ball you leave them they're intended to be used you leave them discarded on the floor and you put write a note that says for weaklings only no the master ball is like okay in my kitchen cabinet greg you can come over and see it sometime i have a porcelain plate that has like six images of the historical sites in the town of port chester new york that is a plate that is not intended to be eaten off of that's the master ball is the pokeball that is not intended to catch pokemon it is fancy it is nice to look at do not use it do not eat off my porchester plate please the master ball is proof that you got to a certain level that they said yes you are a pokemon master here is our commemorative ball but do not ever use this it is for display purposes and you're too afraid of being a true master trainer and catching your herdier the normal way a premiere ball if you want to be possible right now i threw a master ball at a snorlax and let's go pikachu let's go eevee cause it was shiny and i was afraid it was gonna run sometimes you gotta let sometimes you just gotta accept the luck throw the master ball and move on with life all right it just shows the difference in our upbringing yeah you're telling me you would let a shiny snorlax run away from immediate rather than ever use a master ball yes i am bougie like that yes i i have learned to wait and be patient to get things the way that i want them not this quick easy millennial whatever's fine just chuck the ball and move on with my life i can't be bothered to do things properly this is this is what's wrong with your generation grace and decorum oh anyways the journey starts december 4th again i mean it already started the journey continues okay so uh we talked about calorics and uh glat glass deer glace deer lace i heard somebody say victory or the good one i heard somebody say glacier like the ier makes an a sound i don't know if this was france in the same french believe me if there's one thing you want to learn about the united kingdom is they will not pronounce french words properly so they will never lose they will never say ea they say ballot for the ballet they say fill it for a filet but they would not say glacier this isn't kalos this is galler we got hard r's in this country uh we'll have to talk to our al correspondent make sure the uh hard r's are still ask ask al ask stuart to ask anybody in that country if they say ballot or ballet and they will say ballot they say phillip or filet they always say fill it so anyways we have ice horse and ghost horse i think is what most people refer to them because no one knows how to say these names so we talked about these last week uh and the reason i was i was one comfortable with talking about them last week is because the dlc is one i would argue way shorter than the crowd the isle of armor story wise uh depends on how you approach it i think they're pretty equal story-wise yeah there's not a lot to that cub food story yeah but i think that the the beats in between can take longer like like yeah they forced you to spread that out more yes and they don't in here because there's more things to do here right and this you you find the calorics you um talk to them you ride your bike to well you you go into the town you talk to five people you talk to him you you get the carrot you plant the carrot you go to the tower you're done that's like the gist of the story so if you if you got if you wanted to experience the story first you could probably do that whole story in less than 45 minutes about 15 yeah or so minutes into the story you see these horses whichever one you decide to go with the ghost or the ice yep i was also confident last week that we talked about it that the pokemon company would talk about these horses before the players cup 2 which took place this weekend because these horses are very good and they're allowed in official competition so kind of putting two and two together you know it's been a couple weeks since the dlc there's this competition coming up where they're allowing these two horses that they haven't talked about yet i was very confident that us talking about them last week would go into the pokemon the pokemon company obviously listened to the show and they were like oh well steve will and greg talked about the horses so yeah we can but they they officially announce these horses so no no surprises here uh but there is the last glastrier and spectrier and then there is the they can merge with calorics or when you initially catch it in the game they're already merged to ice rider calorics and shadow rider calorics are the official titles they love their fusions this is how many games in a row necrozma fusion did x and y x and y did not have a fusion no no possibly zygarde was supposed to fuse but yeah that dude never got his day yeah zygarde has its own weird thing it has it fuses with itself oh yeah the cells yeah i don't know that that counts though black and white has their fusions we talked about their abilities last week if i remember correctly yes ice rider or sorry the rider forms i'll just call them ride reforms um they have their own abilities as well so calorics has an ability glacier and specter have an ability and then when they're merged they have another ability there that ability is called as one which is a new ability so it combines the effects of calirex's ability which is unnerved and spectre's ability of grim nay ice rider it's like chilling day yeah what a time to be alive we have a pokemon now with two abilities yeah well you know in the next pokemon game they're going to have triple type pokemon so that's that's what they're getting you ready for i'm sure there will be one pokemon that will have three types i mean dell mize is pretty close to that yeah downwards is really close to that uh what's that one move flying press i think does both flying and fighting fighting damage yeah that's not a pokemon that's a move i know but they got stuff they got saying that they have salted the waters for krabby i don't even know what that means it was me saying seed of the waters but like steve would say it oh there you go are you guys done with crown tundra are you still playing it what's what's the verb i only just shook the tree to get the birds yeah i'm still chasing birds on because i'm trying to do a little bit of mark hunting i've been super busy so i have not had a ton of time to play i want to try to get some i've been doing a bunch of dynamax adventures like i feel like this game probably needs to last a year more so i don't feel a rush to get a bunch of stuff done yeah maybe i mean omega ruby alpha sapphire had that two-year thing right yeah and i would argue that this game has more content yes yeah i mean yeah well if you add in the dlc yeah i mean i mean who's playing a year into the game and refusing to buy the dlc i mean a lot of people a lot a bunch of people aren't getting out of money like you yeah you think well one you had a long time to save up thirty dollars it's like three dollars it's like that's like a mowing sword and shield because my uncle bought it for me so unless my uncle gets me the dlc yeah they're probably kids who haven't played it yet there are probably people who are waiting because they don't have the money or not i would say kids would move on they got they have unlimited free mobile games that they can be going between i don't know if they're still applying a year into it i'm not allowed to have a mobile device yeah that is true i had to take it away you were abusing it um i wasn't getting my homework done [Laughter] in in my neck of the world see you thought myself [Laughter] my neck of the woods i think is the actual yeah there you go congrats it seems like people that i have interacted with which is a very small sample of pokemon fans out of all of the pokemon fans i don't want to i understand that this is a nut this could be a nutshell uh evaluation here um they seemed more excited and more happy with the crown tundra uh and that's i think mostly because like dynamics adventure and being able to catch the legends and new legends and and whatnot compared to the isle of armor which was very competitive focused correct it just seems like people are were have been over the crown tundra quicker than they were over the olive armor what do you mean by over uh it just seems like they got their fill and they've moved on to different games whereas with the isle of armor it just seems like they kind of kept going with it um i don't know i'm still doing dynamaxx adventures a couple of nights a week so until i get a full every legendary as a shiny i'm gonna keep at it i think they extended the life of viola armor because they did a bunch of they did a bunch of events that did max right stuff to fill in the time frame where we just haven't had that we had the halloween event and then if you're not heavily into dynamics adventures or you ran through them and you're not shining hunting there's just not a lot there's not more to do and the the other problem in my opinion is that even though i like the new wild area there's nothing exciting in the new wild area compared to what i think the initial ex impression of the isle of armor which a lot of it was water but there were so many new pokemon walking around and yeah unfortunately as it turns out in the crown tundra over half of that pokedex is legendaries yeah i think you don't have a lot of variety you see a lot of old pokemon in the crown tundra which doesn't make it like maybe that like ex explorer worthy well it's the same problem that will had right i have a problem we had a problem with the first game is that you were like when you hit the wild area and you're seeing a bunch of old pokemon that you'd already seen before yeah i think people were expecting to see a lot more older pokemon in crown tundra and that just didn't manifest and in fact that first day i saw a lot of things that had already caught filling the pokedex for crown tundra does not feel like i can spend a lot of time hearing catching things no because it's it's really i have to do all of these legendary things and that's a shiny hunting thing and so and the legendaries don't even matter for the decks right so it's just like well i mean like the ones in dynamics adventure sorry right so there's like just not a lot of collecting really to be done it didn't feel like they had expanded that dex by a lot yeah i had more fun catching gosh well i i i think the catching in isle of armor was better like exploring the olive armor catching everything to fill the decks i think was dramatically better than the crown tundra and this is you know i love catching but at a certain point with crown tundra i was like electabuzz only appears like three days out of the week and i guess i could just like take the one electavire i found earlier and take it to the daycare and spin in a circle and breed it and then evolve it or i can just connect my pokemon home and then move over the electabuzz because like there wasn't other it wasn't because like i don't mind waiting like the three days or the whatever for thunderstorms to appear for electabuzz to appear it was there was really nothing else to catch yeah whereas in like the isle of armor if it was like oh well polly toad only appears when it's raining and it's like okay well i know it's raining tomorrow and i still have like 40 other pokemon to catch so i'll just work on those 40 pokemon and then because i know i won't finish that and then tomorrow will be raining and i'll find the polytoad and they'll be good how do you know it's going to be raining tomorrow are you a meteorologist yeah that's the i went to sonia and i said look let me know when polly toad's spawning and she's like here's the here's our book on meteorology the diglett stuff as much as we complain took a lot of time and it was way more tedious than the uh i still haven't completed it oh me either and i haven't completed the footprints i have the worst time finding verizon's footprints because i can't visually really see the difference and i keep going up to sets of rocks because they are much more visibly different and going oh oh it's a pair of rocks okay so where's the footprints all right i don't think it's a big deal i just wanted to bring up that i just felt like people are already over crown tundra compared to what seemed to be decent legs on an earlier dlc that was more focused for ev training and ivy training and and you know maybe dipping your toe into battling whereas this is more of i i think it varies a lot and i know a lot of people who just caught everything the crown timer and i'm not a crown tender but i love armor and we're done like i didn't play a lot of vile armor i didn't complete half the stuff over there because much of it was for competitive and i'm playing a lot of crown tender because there's a lot of things to do and the dynamics adventures are super fun um i think it really varies what people wanted to get out of it i also think we are a year into the game and the dlc is very good but i don't think it added enough of what people wanted outside of dynamics adventures yeah agreed like they really like they had i said this last time i said again like they had a chance to really expand the pokedex more and they just they just didn't which is fine but it does limit the appeal of when you're there and like oh i see all these fossil ones right in this first area and that's really cool and then you go to the next area and it's literally everything you've already caught this is a little disheartening to have that happen when you were sort of hoping this would bring a lot more old favorites and a couple of news back and it just didn't uh i do actually have a complaint about crown tundra there we go they lock the champion star battle behind you finishing peony's quest line what's a champion oh that's right okay which is like i don't i'm not like i i i don't want to do that yet you know anyway like if i don't know what reggie i want or if i wanted to shiny hit the red jeez which they allow and you don't even have to re turn off your game uh you can knock it out it will reappear you can run away again you know we've been talking about this for over a year they clearly do not want us turning on and off our games anymore which is fine i know some people aren't happy with it i think it's fine i think it's a bad way to interact with a video game so even if you wanted to uh if you want if you weren't sure what dredge you wanted or if you were stuck in dynamics adventure or wanted a shiny hat these you have to finish the reggies you have to finish the calorics thing which i think is probably the first thing you should do since it's like the main story part of it and then you also have to do the three birds which again if you not i don't think the birds take as long as the reggie's they're shiny locked you could mark hunt them i made a mark hunting guide for the birds on youtube if you want to check that out uh but to force you to do those three things to do another thing something that is like designed for you to in my mind do like once a day the championship battle thing it's just kind of silly like i still don't know like i guess i want reggie ella key like i think i've decided that because i think it does the better competitive one um right now but like a couple days ago i was like man i just don't know which one i want and i like the the answer is well just play through the game plug i'll play through your sword version get the other one i was like yeah i get that and that takes time but i just want to try the galler start tournament and i don't want just it just seems weird that this other thing that they this other thing they added to the dlc is locked behind you doing three very time consuming things and it's not like like look you're battling npcs in a double battle it's not like it's gonna be harder difficult or like you know it's not gonna like revolutionize or change the game you're just gonna go through it you're going to see some cool dialogue you're probably going to get a bunch of money from it and then it's like oh maybe i'll do that once a day to get like gal or champion ribbon i don't even know if it assigns the gallery champion ribbon i don't know if you just have to do like single battles to get that ribbon but it just that's that seemed weird to me that they decided to do that yeah i i don't like it when they lock things behind they're not hard tasks but they are time consuming tasks they are time and especially if you want you're not a game gobbler and you want to just like enjoy the game like me like i finished all of calorics it took me a while and now i'm just starting on the birds and it's probably going to take me a week to do that and then it's going to be another week for me to do the reggie's and yeah by that time it's like doing competitive all-star blah blah and pass monster hunter rise is on the horizon so oh look if you haven't gotten to the all-star part by march i'd be very concerned no i'm just saying it's like i probably after that many weeks in crown tundra i'm going to be more inclined to go back into monster hunter generation's ultimate and get my monster hunter fix in preparation for rise than to actually worry about the all-star tournament my thought process is if the all-star tournament gives you a bunch of money and it's one of the best ways to get money that would be something i would love to do once a day are you hurting for money in this game because i'm certainly like i don't do your little daily tasks yeah i got tons of cash i have a a great portfolio of different assets in the game i have you know my like 700 big nuggets and i have my 400 star pieces and i have my 600 luxury balls and i i it's very diverse you know i got my big pearls i got my ball mushrooms and stuff i got i got a good supply but as i have bought a bunch of vitamins then gone to that madame cleansy or whatever her name is to so i bought a bunch of vitamins i eevee trained all my pokemon very quickly for this tournament i then needed to change some ev spreads so i had to go cleanse them for 10 armored ore and then rebuy the vitamins it becomes very expensive very quickly um and if if i wasn't on a time limit like if the tournament wasn't in like when i was doing this it was monday wednesday i pretty much did it every day monday tuesday wednesday thursday if i wasn't on a time limit i would just ev train them like the old-fashioned way because it doesn't take that long to take like five pokemon and find like a knock dowel which i think is plus two hp evs and knock them out in like 15 minutes but i used to do in the old days yeah the old days but i needed a little bit more precise eevees and i was on a time limit so i bought a bunch of vitamins and you go through money very very quickly so if there was like one thing i could add to my daily rotation of you know check all these dents to get the watts shake these trees to get the apricorns because i'm still looking for you know safari balls or sports balls and then like oh it takes you know 10 minutes to run through champion star galler double battle or whatever it's called that would be a nice addition to the rotation but i haven't done the regis so i can't add that to my rotation because i wasn't ready to do reggie's yet and for anyone being like why don't you just sell all your ball mushrooms and your gold nuggets and all that stuff yeah i could do that but the the problem is that the money has a cap so it would be silly to cap out the money when in my inventory i'm not near the cap of those items you mean you can only hold so much money yeah uh watts i don't think uh nine million um i don't think there's a limit on a watts but i but i don't have any watts anymore either because i spent all my watts to get wishing pieces so i could hunt for guys so i had like 4 million watts and i cashed them all in for wishing pieces so i can't even like cash in my watts for luxury balls because i spent all those because i think watts are better for wishing pieces at this point because there's other ways to get money and now my money's going into vitamins it's it's if if they've done anything right i feel like they've really done pretty well with the economy of money watts armorite uh dinite and whatever else like i think they've done a really decent battle balance for all that stuff and i gotta save my armor right because the madame cleanse lady charges like 10 for them and all the good moves are at the dojo and they cost five i think she's expensive i think 10 is a lot to reset evie's she's a ripoff and yet you still keep patronizing her business well i gotta swim out she's on an island will she doesn't even have her own roof roof over her head well maybe that's her hint to stop bugging her i'm out of this island and if you really want to see me and i really don't want you to i guess you can swim out here all right let's take a quick break we got we when we come back we have a little bit more pokemon news and then uh question of the week this week and pokemon oh alien invasion based virus possessing humans mysterious faces [Music] and we are back should

and moon unified mines sun and moon cosmic eclipse and then sword and shield rebel clash darkness ablaze and then vivid voltage are the four newest sword and shield sets and then hidden fates is allowed um champions like michael cephalon death has been completely rotated out now no blissful on most of blue cephalon is still in because that was like all the good parts are gone ah well they're at work nah well there's an unbroken bond okay you just need a welder welder is good basically this is cool i guess i i am in an unfortunate position where i don't have a store i care about nor host tcg like good like you know what i mean it's like go to your favorite board gaming store and like support them and it's like i don't have that you guys do though you guys have like a board gaming store you love i mean i'm literally looking at a board gaming store through my window right now so yes i mean yeah also the source but under pokemon team challenge find my store there are no stores yet so i couldn't even sign up right now if i wanted there's they're still trying to make uh the pokemon trading card game online work to work right i mean they haven't updated it it made it better yet right no there's a there was a um player's cup this past weekend for both the vgc and the tcg and do you if you were playing in the tcg using pokemon trading card game online the official client of the pokemon trading card game and you're winning and the game bugs out and now you it becomes unplayable do you win that match does your opponent win that match who what judge is deciding what happened because your game is so incredibly buggy that the match state has been completely stopped because of the game itself not because of the players don't know mysteries of the universe it's not good it does seem very unpleasant i like the pokemon trading card game online i think it's for the most part if you're just climbing ladder if you're just doing matches it's whatever like uh no one's putting their their like win-loss ratio from the ladder on like their linkedin profile it's not like the end of the world of the game you speak for yourself so attitude not the like the game bugs out and you lose but in an official tournament oh my gosh that would be awful rage inducing now do you think since they have until december 5th that they're going to take this time to implement vast improvements greg are you you better check your medications um i'm asking out of love for the game that i don't play you know usually if a card doesn't work they just straight up ban it for several months yup and then not get around to fixing it and when i i wish i was exaggerating when i said several months but what set was it i think it was unbroken bonds they introduced a card called fighting dojo um which added i think plus 20 damage to all fighting pokemon which made it pretty good in a hitmontop hitmonlee hitmonchan deck that all kind of worked together and right out the gate fighting dojo was broken and they banned it and it stayed banned for about three months which if you wanted to play that new card and practice on tcgo because before covid you wanted to take that deck to a tournament and that one card that is a staple in your deck is banned on the online game it's not super good play testing for your deck is there an alternate alternate there are so many main things yes but i think what you you guys are really missing is this very uh unspoken right it's the same thing with the whole like season five versus season six and the vgc where you couldn't play test because they rotated the rules and you couldn't test the bl no no no no no no no tpci does not want people play testing period done they are doing everything in their power to stop people from play testing in the vgc and in the tcg yeah it's true as a conspiracy face reality just like bubblegate needs to be answered oh i'm working on it i am working i have i am out of buy bubbles bulbasaur stickers so my next bubble store sticker that i get it's either gonna say buy or it's not and we will have cracked the case i will say that while i do believe the vgc was uh a mistake of the person not downloading the the latest rule set and then hosting the tournament with the latest rule set uh i think that is a huge difference in 10 years of i don't know who to blame at this point direwolf digital or like being incompetent as a developer or except they're not they're very successful in every other aspect yeah that's what confuses me and or blaming the pokemon company for not giving direwolf digital the the the right staff the right amount of money the amount of time like sometimes just throwing money at a problem doesn't solve it and sometimes just throwing money at a problem does solve right is it like is it the situation where they that the pokemon company doesn't pay direwolf digital enough to hire more developers or is it that the developers who are working on it are like the bottom tier developers because we know that the other games direwolf digital puts out are functioning games at the end of the day what matters is that they've done two players cups through tcgo and both have been not good i would say if somebody is competing at a high level and your game bugs out and that is an irreversible game decision is an awful situation to be in as one of those players whether you are winning or you're losing and it happens to you or your opponent that is not good for both people that are qualifying in taking time training practicing competing at a high level for your video game digital card game i guess and so they've done two players cups and now they're doing this and this game is still broken uh whereas at least in the vgc where they picked the wrong well we're assuming they picked the wrong one they were supposed to pick six they picked five at least from everything i've heard everything i've experienced nothing has ever broken at a competitive level with sword and shield i know in sudden moon they had to like ban string shot for like six months because the string shot was broken but mechanically sword and shield competitive is very sound like it works it's fine i've participated in the players cup this weekend which was an awesome experience even though i lost should be very excited that i got as far as i did to even compete in the player's cup but the cool thing on top of that was i got to see how it worked and it ran through battlefly which hosts a ton of tournaments and you could see the bracket ahead of time and once the bracket went live it paired you with a person that person you had an individual text chat with you just you both decided on an eight-digit code you matched up you did your match was best two out of three you did your second match if it was 1-1 you did your third match and then the winner would report the score and it had an option to upload screenshots so whether you used your iphone or your android phone or to use the switch screenshot or i mean i uh was playing on my computer through my elgato so i was just able to screenshot my desktop you could upload the win loss ratio in the three slots and then report that to the judge and as soon as you reported it whether like if you if you if you were in the winner's bracket spoiler i wasn't if you were in the winner's bracket uh you would wait for the next pairing and the computer system would already pair you and you'd be set to go if you went into the losers bracket um you would get matched with somebody else who lost um so the tournament worked like this you know it was for north america was the top 256 players everyone had an opponent uh i think out of the top 256 10 people didn't register in time and then 10 people didn't upload their deck list in time not that well their poke their six pokemon lists 230 out of 250 people competing so a couple people got round one buys but once we got into the loser bracket it matched me up with another person and then i beat that person and then it matched me up with another person right away that was 1-1 and then that person defeated me so the tournament worked if you lost twice you were out of the tournament and at that second loss the tournament was like thank you for playing you're out like it was so smooth to and i've been to countless will and myself have been to countless pokemon tournaments where we are waiting forever for round one because they always they always started late we got hold on hold on we've messed up the pairings we've got to repair everybody you're awkwardly sitting across your form of your opponent for way too long you've run through your chitchat you you get pair you finally get to battle that person and then it feels like an it feels like if you if it was a short battle like maybe you you just got lucky you had the you had good rng you you had the correct deck you beat them pretty quickly in swiss it sometimes would seem like you're now waiting over an hour for next pairing or if you're one of these people that were playing like the pokey dads which took eight years to play one card and you were the one of like the 30 people that went to the 45 minute time limit and then as soon as you finish that match it's like what pairings are up for next round and you're like ah geez i gotta pee and get something to drink but i gotta sit back down against somebody else right away uh it was one of the smoothest official pokemon tournaments that i've ever competed in what i'm saying is i don't know what the tcg people are doing they're out of their minds to be hosting and continuing to use this broken game like they just need to fix their game like i want to play the tcg i miss the tcg i have a lot of cards invested in tcgo i have a lot of cards irl i'm sitting through next to 17 stacks of cards right now same but i pokemon cards though can't even imagine participating in a tcg pokemon tournament knowing that their app is incredibly broken also thank you to everyone who wished me luck this past weekend i'm super sorry i lost i tried hard to win i won one better next time i won one you i mean you only really started what like heavy duty this year i think that's impressive growth i think you should be proud of what you accomplished i agree you'll do much better next time like for years you said how much you didn't like competitive and you've jumped in and you have improved incredibly you got to the players cup which is fantastic that's all amazing things and if you keep with it i'm sure you'll do great don't beat yourself up let me beat you up yeah we'll we'll take it to text and rip you a new one okay perfect yeah yeah there was um countless times on the show where i did not like vgc competitive but i think now that i understand it better i like it but it is uh very time consuming as well which is like the main reason i got out of the tcg competitive because not only was it incredibly time consuming it was uh incredibly expensive this is true of all trading card games my zip code finder is working i got three locations i got game universe game town waukesha and cowabunga comics not board game barrister barrister not on the list i may have to turn off some ad blockers uh i have played many tcg matches at cowabunga comics that's funny you've never taken me there in the many times i've been to milwaukee well it's you know it's an oconomowoc tournament center gg find my store i'm at events.pokemon.com oh locations i'm my tournament center gigi that's listed from there oh actual website you can register to play at that and i can't if i click on cowabunga comics it says this retail location has indicated that it provides the following service options and it says currently supports league at home uh good news will yes sir games minneapolis is in this event finder well thank you for giving out my home address [Laughter] the one that's closest to me also in this nice i need to go to the source because they're gonna have a book that i want real soon wow i want to go there yeah there's some manga that i've been wanting to pick up we gotta do that dude wow there are a lot that do tournaments in minneapolis level up games does it is uh you guys have that board game place in in minneapolis we've got like a thousand board games yeah amazing games the ones that make games are you talking about fantasy fights fantasy flight are they an official pokemon thing probably not right they have a pokemon league no they don't have a league but they have games that are not their games yeah but they don't run leagues they don't run leagues for things that aren't their games oh so they i bet they don't do magic then either correct uh yeah they don't have magic uh i was not trying to say that you could play magic there don't go there to play magic yes you can set up your own stuff there but for things that are officially run through them it's generally their star wars mini products it's their um key forge key forge stuff it's like they're they run their their own tournaments but not like other companies stuff like they have plenty to keep them busy they make a lot of games mystical games i didn't even know that was a place indeed prairie yeah cause it's eden prairie dude i know i don't get out there well their website is currently unavailable so get wrecked uh this is off pokemon.com as well piggybacking off the tcg stuff we just talked about uh vivid voltage will be coming out officially on november 13th although seems like everyone in the world already has vivid voltage at this point vivid voltage will feature just the tiny amount of you know over 185 different cards this will have the chonky pikachu the big chunker pikachu v-max uh it looks like there will be a hitmontop card b will be a card here as a supporter uh the gay raico card is coming out yeah um ninjas should ninja are in the set as well so it should be it should be a pretty good set there's like this this new fad do you guys remember you guys of course you guys remember you're much older than i am yeah but that means our memories are starting to fail yeah oh okay it depends remember what it was from your childhood and we were adults no okay from my childhood when you guys were adults when pokemon came out and everyone was like this is a fad oh yeah yeah oh yeah it was a total there were so many articles about the the new fad how long would this fad last yeah that was everywhere and and there's a tv guide and obviously we know that pokemon isn't a fad you know it's lasted all this all this time you know there was maybe a point where it was at its lowest of low you know after gen 2 before gen 3 that kind of stuff but there's like this new actual pokemon fad that's existing where it was a couple big youtubers they suddenly decided to like buy old booster boxes of pokemon cards oh i've seen this yes i've seen screenshots of people like i have uh blah blah blah blah booster box and it cost me blah money and yeah so what i'll i'll explain it for people out of the loop take a take a big youtuber pkmncast nope i said big youtubers okay so anyways just take a big youtuber you know they these youtubers are millionaires at this point right i'm talking about like not pew well pewdiepie is number one but you know up there with pewdiepie they buy like a a 50 000 box of pokemon cards you know something old first edition you know very rare and what they do is they they like 50 000 to them is a drop in the bucket right they probably make 50 000 on a single youtube video with ad revenue they they buy this 50 000 box and then they ask their their youtube friends where they ask other people if they want to buy into the box because a booster pack of these cards might be around a thousand dollars or so 1500 or so so then their their friends you know youtube friends celebrities fans that just apparently have a thousand dollars sitting around will buy into the box and so now they they buy a 50 000 box which for an average person listening to this show probably just doesn't have fifty thousand dollars to buy pokemon cards with maybe there's like two or three listeners if you are one of those two and three listeners patreon.com uh please support the show but uh like an average person doesn't have 50 000 to spend on pokemon cards heck i would say most don't even have a thousand dollars to buy one single booster pack but they call i think they're called breaks so a big youtuber buys a fifty thousand dollar box they say hey you can buy into my box for a thousand dollars fifteen hundred dollars and then people do and so in reality the youtuber isn't really spending any money they're spending the money up front but they're getting a lot of their money back because people are buying in and then they post the video and then you know people watch it and then they get the ad revenue so this is the fad and what this has okay but why why are people buying into this box this is the disconnect for me yeah you're not gonna get a thousand dollars worth of cards out of it you could are they but but are they being sent the thousand dollars of cards like yeah youtube you bought the pack so if you let's say it was like i'm just trying to think let's say you were doing like uh gosh i'm trying to think of like what what cards i know off the top of my head somebody's gonna write and be like you were wrong about the price for just because i can't i'm not gonna pull up card prices let's just say we were doing like fossil set and let's say a fossil booster pack is 300 i don't think it is but just for the just humor me for the sake of this conversation let's say you spent 10 000 on a fossil booster box you're telling people that it's 300 to buy in and if you pulled uh let's just say hollow aerodactyl from fossil that the aerodactyl would be worth 500 so you say i want to buy a booster booster pack in your box it's 300 they will then most of these are are streamed either on twitch or youtube they then open the pack and they'll say this is greg's pack thank you greg for supporting the break box we're gonna open it up we're gonna carefully move one card here we're gonna go through all of your cards because this is your pack reg we're gonna go through it and at the end oh you got a omastar raw gosh you know this is a great omastar you know only worth about 45 cents but you know you're gonna love it when we when we send it your way so this is what happens um it's like this we it like this this is an actual thing that is existing i am now seeing smaller content creators buying boxes having people buy in this is truly a fad and i just don't i guess it's like two things right like you're being featured on their content you know if you're if your favorite youtuber is i don't know uh will smith i don't will smith's not a youtuber but will smith decides to buy a box of uh something and then you buy in and then the thought process is they open it they say it's your your pack you know you do the thing and then they they send you the pack afterwards and you know if you're lucky and you maybe you got the aerodactyl you spent 300 on the booster pack but now you have a 500 aerodactyl that you could apparently i mean sell this is the other weird part is while the aerodactyl is 500 again i don't know how much aerodactyl is this is just hypothetical you bought you bought a booster pack for 300 bucks let's say you pulled the 500 aerodactyl that's assuming you have somebody that wants to buy the aerodactyl you know what i mean just because i was just not gambling it is gambling it's 100 gambling how is this not falling under like the weird pyramid scheme stuff like how are they just going to set it it does feel like a pyramid scheme i mean it's buy into my thing and you may get rewards at least somebody might see it if you're opening up on packs but you're you're spending way more money than you're getting in like way more thing about it too is if you just wanted to buy one of these booster packs you can just buy that booster pack there are especially with the older packs that are weighted um because we we know that newer booster packs are designed to all weigh the same so you can't tell what's in it but older booster packs were never like that so older booster packs heavier packs are more likely to have good stuff if you wanted to buy like i don't know first edition team rocket you could buy into somebody's brake but they're going to charge you an up charge one because they want to make money off of you so let's just say a team rocket booster pack is i actually think a team rocket first edition booster pack is like 800 to a thousand dollars depending on the weight normally if a pack weighs more it'll be more money because you're more likely to get something good and the packs that don't weigh as much will be cheaper but somebody might be like buy into my team rocket booster box it's 300 bucks so it's like you're spending 300 more dollars to buy into somebody else's box when you could just go to ebay and buy your own pack save 300 and then you get your own enjoyment of opening the pack yourself yeah but a famous person touched my pack and touched my cards that's what's important i mean are they at least signing a card in there for you i mean i guess they could this is what if they're going to sign your you know 500 aerodactyl your aerodactyl's not worth 500. this whole youtube cult of personality thing is not completely bizarre and against everything that we were raised to believe i don't know where you've been well i think i think for the youtuber it is it is good content i think like if you're a fan of that youtuber if you're a fan of i don't know pewdiepie uh i'm not but if you are a fan of pewdiepie and they open up pokemon cards you might as a viewer go like wow this was really fun i haven't thought about pokemon cards in a while i want to go get myself a charizard like that is that is a common like path of like your favorite creator introducing you in something you might have had nostalgia for uh but what has happened what has happened in the last couple weeks since this break thing has started is other creators have been jumping on the bandwagon of like i have no interest in pokemon cards i've seen so and so do this it's gotten them a ton of views i'm sure the ad revenue is good so i'm gonna jump in on it and it's driving the market of cards up because now there's this demand of i'm looking for older cards to buy because the rarer the older it is the the harder it is to get the more money i will spend because you know no one wants to see no one wants to buy into a darkness ablaze break because i can go on cool stuff inc and i can get darkness ablaze for 99 bucks because it just came out three months ago but what it has done is it's made older cards harder to find it has drive those older cards slightly up in price and it has taken current cards like vivid voltage which comes out in a couple days and now people are buying that up because that is the newest set and people just want to get something that is new and that is pokemon so it's kind of been a bit harder not impossible but it's been a bit harder to find vivid voltage um and champions path uh which came out recently because so many people who are not pokemon fans have just started getting pokemon cards and i don't want this to sound like i'm gatekeeping anyway it's very cool that like people have this interest in pokemon cards but i do believe it is is a fad for them where they will buy it they will they will do their content then they will maybe pull like a 50 000 uh i don't know lugia or something first edition lugia it'll be a moment put lugia aside or maybe sell it and then kind of forget about it like and then these cards will eventually drop again in price when people have moved on to whatever the next youtube fad is this feels very strange i agreed i don't get why you would pay upwards of 300 for somebody else's content on the off chance that you could use it as your content though right like if you're a content creator like let's say i i wanted to buy into somebody's break let's say real breaking nate was doing a break i don't think he is i love real breaking nate one of my favorite tcg content creators well let's say he decides to get on this bandwagon he buys a box of i don't know first edition team rocket and he says you know it's a thousand dollars if you want to join in on my break which i think again i think team rocket packs are like eight hundred to a thousand dollars and i go sure yeah i love one pack yeah well yeah it's team rocket i don't know what you want i got a bunch of first edition team rockets sitting in a trapper keeper in my basement right now because i was a liar like my dad bought those when it came out is it bad as tulips in brussels and whatever the 1800s so if i if i bought into again this is just hypothetical if nate decides to do team rocket whatever thousand dollars i want to buy in because then that puts me on his youtube video but also i i would assume because i've seen this with other content creators that when he opens my pack that that however long it takes at five six minutes i that is my content as well because i paid for that moment so he gets are you in there with them like do you get to jump into their stream and be like i've seen let's talk together yeah i've seen somewhere where the the person will like discord call the other person so they'll be on call together either as they're opening it or sometimes even video call um or sometimes they're like oh so and so can't be here you know this is uh this is steve he's uh he does a pokemon podcast every week he bought into a break thanks for the a thousand dollars i really hope you got good luck in this pack and then they open the pack and it's like i don't know like giovanni's nidoran um which is like worth like 50 cents but if you're a youtuber and you're thinking oh if i spend a thousand dollars on somebody else's content not only do i get featured on their content but now i have like five to six minutes that i can put on my youtube channel and hopefully i can make the a thousand dollars back in ad revenue i i think your weight overthinking it i i think this is literally the equivalent of boy it's really hard this is a pyramid scheme well no no but it's great but but also it's like you know we're we're saying the value we're devaluing it because it's youtube people and we're all older and out of the youtube lifestyle but if i were to say like taylor swift is opening a box of pokemon cards and you can buy in and you're gonna get mailed a set of pokemon cards from taylor's there are rabid taylor swift stands who just want pokemon cards that taylor swift touched and that same rabidity exists for youtubers no that's what i said with the pewdiepie right like if pewdiepie decides to open a box of cards and you are a pewdiepie fan but not a pokemon fan and there's and he's saying you know it's a thousand dollars and you get one of these packs i i don't doubt that there's probably thousands of people that would do that deal because they like that dude so much like that that doesn't surprise but that's that's i mean that's the basis that that is the foundation for where this is coming from it makes no sense because we're not we're not stands we're not it's just not i just can't wait there is no spending i i am a super fan of star wars i would not pay a thousand dollars to get a pack of cards mark hamill touched [Laughter] there is no way agreed agreed a thousand i'm gonna look at and say yes i have no way of verifying that this person actually touched this set of cards i'm paying a thousand dollars to a random person to be mentioned by by mark hamill on the stream for five minutes while they did something else and i'm gonna pay a thousand dollars for that for mystery cards like well you could get a five thousand dollar card out of a thousand dollar pack i mean that is part of the appeal as well so you're basically paying mark hamill to go to las vegas and pull the right the slot machine for you and film it this is your pull well this is like the untalked about well it's not even untalked about but the thing about buying so when a person buys a booster box of cards which is normally a thousand dollars or sorry a hundred dollars geez so would you go if you're a fan of pokemon cards or just pokemon maybe you want to get into pokemon cards and every three months in the united states pretty much every three months around the world not japan you want to collect the newest set of pokemon cards you're spending a hundred dollars nobody wants very few people want to collect the set of pokemon they want the cards that they want the pokemon collectors it's very few and far between there are plenty of people that want to complete the set it's just hard to complete the set if you have no friends that's also expensive to complete the set i mean that's a life lesson it's hard to complete a lot of things if you don't have any friends so every three months you're spending a hundred dollars you're getting 32 booster packs and normally it's i wouldn't say that it's rare like most booster boxes for 100 bucks you open those 32 packs and you walk away feeling from what i pulled if i was to sell this right now on the market i will get my hundred dollars back because there are there are just cards that are worth you know if if you get out of 320 cards right 10 cards per pack 18 32 packs yeah 320 cards you probably have at least 10 of those 320 cards are probably worth around 10 some might be worth five some might be worth 20 maybe one is worth 50. but after you open 32 packs of cards you're probably going to have over a hundred dollars in things you can sell back and that is you buying an entire pack and again but there's the situation where you go to target you spend four dollars on a pack of cards you open it everything in that pack is worth less than the four dollars and you feel kind of slighted you go ah this was a bad pack ugh i see a green card it's not a white card it's gonna be bad but it's pretty safe buying a box of cards if you and not feeling super slighted because the majority of the blocks will get you your money back if you decide to sell i cannot imagine because that's not talked about in these breaks you know you you get an old booster box fifty thousand dollars there's the reason it's fifty thousand dollars is because there's probably a couple cards that are worth ten thousand dollars or twenty five thousand dollars or fifty thousand dollars because that's why the box costs so much because there's a couple cards in that set that are worth something because they're hard to find they're rare they're limited it's been so long some of these cards are lost or damaged to time so there's a reason why a 50 50 000 box is a 50 000 box but i can't imagine being that person on the hype cycle totally i love the content creator i love that this is thing this is like i love watching this i love the content creator i have a chance to support them i can buy in here's a thousand dollars and then their pack is like the pack that is like i'm sorry that your your pack's only worth like five bucks like you don't hear about that afterwards you hear about the moments of like wow so-and-so pulled the like the seventy thousand dollar card unreal like whoa what an amazing box but like how many people walked away with like the the like the 45 cent card but they're the ones that there's 36 packs in a box it'd be 35 other people no i would well probably like 25 other people because in in like a in a normal box in an average booster box you're probably getting like four to five decent pulls i mean i've had i've had i have probably bought 30 boxes in the last 12 years and i felt like out of those 30 boxes one box was absolutely awful and i felt a few of those boxes were like above average like i was like wow this box is nothing but bangers just pulling banger after banger in this box but that's but like there is an average uh of like okay i expect you know five or six good cards out of the 32 booster packs is it 32 or is it 36 i can't even remember remember it's one anyways i don't know i just think i just think it's it's i wanted to bring it up because vivid voltage is coming out soon and i feel like the tcg market is in this weird flux right now because of this um because of this fad that is kind of going around on on youtube and twitch i don't think like the fad was like i don't think the fad started to be like hurting anyone it just people are piggybacking off of it because that's what's hot right now but i don't think it'll be hot forever speaking of something hot forever pokemon that was the worst uh there's the two community days later this month i think we talked about that last week yep on a couple days ago here niantic posted that there's new tests coming for select trainers beginning on monday november 9th which will be the day this podcast goes up they are conducting an xp rebalancing for australia and new zealand in which trainers will experience adjusted xp from catching hatching eggs evolving and more this will run for a week trainers might be seeing different items pop up in free daily box and that's it uh they're changing xp i don't maybe they want people to get to 40 faster at this point to do nothing um but that's not weird i mean like greg in world of warcraft final fantasy you know over over the years of a game running for so long they usually make it so newer people don't feel like they're stuck at level 20 forever but that's to run high-end content what what high-end content are you running in pokemon go um mastercup premier cup the only thing i can think of is battling i mean like if they're doing a month only of master rank battles and you're you like battling and you're only level 25 you cannot compete you have to be 38 i guess i mean yeah it seems weird to rush towards to get more people at the end well that's less game when you get to 40. what what you have yet to answer what changes nothing nothing change you'll find out when you get yeah when you get to 40 you'll find that i have i have i have consulted many players at 40. well we won you get some 40 their games when you get to 40 you have to sign the nda if you can't tell non 40 players what happened and you both well you did not sign this nda no you didn't yeah i did and also my phone uses biometric data so it knows when i'm holding it versus when you're holding it so it doesn't show you the level 40 stuff according the internet we're the same person so give me your phone no yeah the only thing i can think of is the the battling stuff i mean like maybe raids but no yeah it feel i don't know either they're going to like raise the level cap because they want to release like they release things to level higher levels earlier but that sort of defeats the purpose of you get everybody up to the higher level to release them i don't know it's a weird thing i don't get why they're doing it but hey maybe i'll get to 40 this year this will be the year yes okay ranked battles in sword and shield november season has begun this is uh series 7 this is weird series 7 but season 12. so seasons are month long that's why it's season 12 because the game's been out for a year now series seven is the rule set i believe series seven the rules will be available until january so if you decide to get into competitive vgc into sword and shield now nothing is going to be changing for november december and i believe all of january the partner pokemon from hohen and alola are allowed so that's like your incineroars your premarinas your uh uh swamperts those are allowed riko entei suicune latius la latias latios uxi mesprit as of heatran reggie giggis cresselia tornado slenderis landorus tapu coco tapu lele tapu bulu tapufini tapufini being the number one pokemon used right now in vgc nail ego buzzwole pheramosa circuitry celestilla cartana guzzler no no don't don't use gus lord it's bad poiple naganadal stockataka and blacephalon are all allowed as well as the two horses we talked about earlier ice horse ghost horse if you do make it to master ball rank you will get three golden bottle caps 600 battle points 30 armorite ore 30 dinite ore you make it to ultra ball you will get one golden bottle cap 300 bottle bottle cap 300 battle points sorry 10 armored or 10 dinite ore and that is for both single and double so i guess if you did both you would walk away with six bottle caps golden bottle caps 1200 uh battle points etc um so that's going on right now they uh it exists i guess pokemon masters uh they moved on i guess we're we have another egg event i felt like we just did the lapras yeah but here's now we have psychics from november 4th are you a partner i uh full disclosure i am partnered with dna uh from november 4th to november 18th you will have an increased chance of earning eggs from battles uh those may hatch into like abra grimer execute nidoran if you're lucky trainers you can get a shiny abra or a shiny grimer uh and they released alder and volcarona as the newest sink pair alder and volcarona yeah yeah that makes sense why what when he literally has bravery feathers in his home what that all i would say volcarona is his signature pokemon like he's the champion and volcarona has like pseudo legendary base stats remember when people thought volcarona was legendary i i don't understand why him being the champion and the pseudo legendary have anything to do with each other because that's graviary feathers in his home well he uses a bravery i'm not too i'm not the knight he only uses braviary in black and black to white too does not use that in his uh vulcarona is in all teams that he's in throughout the various games i mean i ain't going to complain about a vulcarona getting more exposure because that is a fantastic pokemon right there do do we know why bulbapedia lists one of his pokemon what his volcarona as deceased uh did he have a vulcarona that died no i don't know am i not remembering i remember his son nephew was his son it was his son right yes what was his dude that dude's name oh like i remember flint jr in the past alder starter pokemon died of illness i think that was brought up in the story yes yeah but was the starter volcarona lucky guy [Laughter] i don't remember this part of the story oh in black and black too white too they do say that his la late partner his late starter partner was vulcan so he started with the larvesta dang well he's the champion got a head start yeah i think uh i think volcarona makes sense i wouldn't be surprised if they're saving bravery for somebody else hugh we already have you we don't have you nate that's the protagonist of black white i don't remember which one no hilbert and hilda are the protagonists of black and white which we already have gilbert has the oshawatt yeah hilda has uh the pig knight yeah um nate and somebody is the protagonist of black two white two and i have no clue what they would give nate because they've already given the gen five starters to the other people rosa has snivy oh rosa nate and rosa yeah so rosa has snivy hilbert has oshawott they've shown nate though like we nate's nate is not in the game but i've seen him but i swear i've seen nate in game in the background uh he might have been i think he showed up as a character because like i know nothing about data mines or maybe it's just hilbert and i keep thinking it's nice yeah it has the vibe hard to tell apart other than their hairstyle and hat yeah cause nate has a visor hilbert has a hat nate's hair looks like a quill fish correct okay last bit of news here pokemon center.com release their christmas stuff and it's garbage i got a lot of things from the christmas stuff this year what did you buy you've already bought stuff yeah with what money i don't know you have enough stuff in your house already why are you putting more stuff in your house look look look look i think i i like some of the cr i like the christmas stuff this year personally i hate christmas i mean i love christmas and some of this stuff is very weird i like christmas i think uh i don't have a lot of i don't have a lot of holiday stuff and i would like to slowly start collecting holiday stuff so when it is christmas i can be like this is my christmas stuff that i'm so your house can be full of boxes of things that you only take out for a four week period once a year well i mean christmas is uh christmas is an eight week period will it's all of november and all of december we do not put up christmas decorations until after my brother's birthday i we don't do it till after the day of thanksgiving okay things i like i don't like the candle holders i like that they're ceramic but i think only the eevee one is cute next uh the applin wreath should not be a keychain it should be an ornament i don't like any keychains who's buying keychains the and what are you saying the scoreboard and why do you have a christmas keychain that's like oh okay gotta swap my keys over for this two week period yeah the scar bunny plush is cute these grooky plush is okay the sabol coloring is so weird like they made it all the same color and it's so hard to tell what you're looking at like they did sobble dirty yeah why does sobel have a blue hoodie it should have like a green and red hoodie like red something to set it off like the other ones do it it is so one color and one note it bothers me they're early plush is pretty good yeah they're leaning heavily into gold for christmas so they have they have this gold pikachu that does not say christmas at all except for the fact that it's gold you don't there's not a wreath there's not a holly spring on it there is no hat it is just a pikachu shadow in gold gold is not enough to sell it as a black christmas oh is not holiday to me i have a silver christmas tree fake of course because i got time to deal with real christmas trees it is silver it has white lights and we do a black garland around it because black and silver and gold look really good together and these pillows and this the stocking you're your modernist christmas interpretation your sleek modernist christmas saddens me so if you if you go to the stockings and it's like a gray stocking with the pikachu in a in a snowflake and then it's that that black p with the gold pikachu and then it's like the the the grayish silver and then the white oh my god that is my aesthetic right there bleak no no green no red i want the gray the white the gold the black the the the grayish blue oh perfect perfect christmas color this no christmas at all how's about that perfect christmas colors they're not christmas colors did you not watch the rudolph where the guys like silver and gold silver and gold silver and gold he was talking about me yeah one christmas song from one christmas special that is only american is not like a national take it across the world gold is a standard christmas color because of the whole story but relying solely on silver and gold and calling it christmas when there's no other christmas touches doesn't sell me on your christmas item no there's that it's just a shadow i mean they're they're beautiful but like if if you brought out this mug and plate that just had a silver and gold pikachu on it and pikachu head on the plates you could bring that out at any time of the year and it'd be fine it's like okay this is a gold pikachu nothing about that says christmas yeah not nothing about it says christmas give me an evergreen tree give me a wobble give me a star heck give me a snowflake in silver and gold then i might credit you there is there is a snowflake on the stockings on one stockings who's that you could shoot 90 of this is a gold pikachu on a black background yeah the serving plate is beautiful but also doesn't do anything that says that says christmas this is an all year round serving plate this is my this is not chris this throat blanket which is black and gold pikachu this does not say christmas why we get to extend christmas for eight weeks because instead of just focusing on the word christmas the pokemon company here has focused on the word winter wonders show me silver winter and you can you can winter wonder yourself through november december and some would say possibly january i mean i'm into january the stuff that actually is winter based that has snowflakes that's like the pikachu head in the snowflake i think is is very good but just a weird geometrical patterned pikachu does not scream winter nor holiday nor christmas to me i'm not denying that they're pretty but for uh for a holiday purchase they are not meeting my standard and what i would need it to say this is a holiday event well i mean they did the bulbasaur squirtle pikachu uh charmander stockings and then the the other pikachu pillow a little bit earlier like last week that pikachu is like the gold one with the uh green and red on it oh the ones that i thought were ugly yeah yeah but those have but those stockings all have other businesses you know wintry things they have snowflakes on them they have more traditional holiday colors like the charmander one has they'll have snowflakes on it they all say wintertime these don't this is the it's not a bet it's not a bad thing it's just not a it's not selling me on buying it for christmas although the flameless candle set i might need to buy oh i got those um the other thing i wanted to bring up is the the they got they went real deep they went real hard into the kitchen accessories here they did and there's a lot the pokemon tacks on these christmas accessories are out of the christmas accessory what does that mean wait what i said you mean by a christmas success i meant to say kitchen i'm sorry oh kitchen accessories so they have a pikachu apron 35. these are not christmassy they're just no pokemon e neither are the other things fyi then i christmas either the pikachu apron is 35 the pikachu dish towels a two pack is 20. i was just at target yesterday and i walked down the aisle where they would sell dish towels because i was like how much is just a dish towel it's like four bucks for one at target and you could probably go to walmart and get it for like two bucks honestly um they have uh cloth napkins four pack for 25 they have the pot holders for 15. a cutting board for 20 and it doesn't look like a big cutting board well it's 17 inches by 10 inches so it's okay it's okay i mean it's it's a smaller end cutting board like it's for cutting carrots and stuff carrots um i think the measuring spoons are okay they're 14 but that's again at target i bet you can get a four pack of measuring spoons for like 5.99 um i think the spatulas are a spatula spatulas are a complete ripoff 20 for two and i i am positive that you put these into a dishwasher like three times and that'll be a white spatula all the pokemon is going to be gone pikachu will be here pikachu the shape is kind of weird for us i don't it's uh i think the cookie stamps are i think i think of anything on the list the cookie stamps are probably like the thing you would get and probably get value out of especially if you have kids um yeah i think those are fun oh sure teach your kids poor eating habits go right ahead but man the pokemon tax on some of these like the dish towels the thing that is like going to get dirt the white white dish towels for twenty dollars a two pack that are undoubtedly going to get dirty and probably stained forever like if if there's anything that you shouldn't spend money on it's like nice dish towels that are going to get like red tomato sauce permanently once again we are back to these are the dish towels that you at holiday season hang on the handle of your oven intended to wipe anything clean anything or dry anything do not touch my christmas towels i do bring out christmas towels you are not allowed to use them yeah my parents appreciated me those towels are worth more than you are you think uh forty forty dollars for the tree skirt are tree skirts forty dollars oh no how do you have a tree skirt for an artificial tree cause it makes it look good will i hate christmas you're never going to get positivity out of me i love christmas but christmas tree skirts i mean you can buy a decent looking tree skirt for like 25 bucks and that's a high-end that's kind of a high-end tree skirt this is really expensive i mean it is pokemon tax forty dollars for a silver and go at least at least they put the snowflakes there on it snowflakes on there but it is black with silver and gold i love it i love it um i think the table runner is really really slick too i like a good table runner it's 30 dollars i know that's why i haven't like the only things i think on the list that are reasonable in the pokemon tax i think the i think 25 dollars for a throw pillow is five dollars more expensive than a throw pillow most throw pillows are 20 bucks you're paying 500 5 extra dollars all right here's what we're going to do i'm going to buy a throw pillow you can you can get into my throw pillow break for five dollars and i will send you an exclusive picture of the throw pillow okay i think that's i think the throw pillow where are you paying 25 for throw pillows wait how much targets throw pillows at target go from 15 to 25 yeah yeah yeah that's what i'm saying the average price of a throw pillow is 20. you go to like an ashley's furniture just around yeah no so i think i think the throw pillows are reasonable the average price of a throw pillow is at most fifteen dollars where are you getting thrown out no no that's low end dude that's low end that's like you use it for a year and then it's not good anymore i think the the mug is thir i i the mug is actually mind-blowing like this has to be a type 35 for a mug and a plate this is highway robbery a mug at most should be fifteen dollars oh it's a four piece okay never mind you're getting wait no for the mug includes two mugs and two plates oh okay okay okay actually i take it all back i might order this then oh no [Laughter] okay i take that back i think stockings for 20 is is a ripoff to me but i don't think that's terribly priced because i feel like most most stockings with a brand on it is 20 bucks at target too i think the electric candles are somewhat reasonably priced i think i think so too but i don't know if they're good i don't know if they're the kind that actually flicker they just look like they like they just look like they just light up which is not great but they're kind of cute i may buy i may buy the flameless game we'll see do you think two ortom i think ornaments are always overpriced too two ornaments for 25 no i mean if they were anything other than bulbs bulb ornaments are super cheap and unfortunately that tend to have the the pattern put on as an extra layer and they will scrape off really easy two ball ornaments is not for 25 bucks is not a great price i really like the napkin rings i mean they're good but napkin rings but they ain't christmas or holiday or winter winter wonderland greg you can call it it's a wonderland because i'm wondering what value these pieces of garbage actually have they're made out of brass is that good my worry with the napkin rings is you can just bend them with your hands and then they crack who's sitting there bending your napkin rings smack their hand do not let the children at the table with the napkin rings i'm not buying stuff from my home when nobody's coming to my home for christmas this year yeah but they last forever do they don't look like they will you think twenty dollars for stockings too much yes have a stocking i can't wear on my feet yes have i paid that you bet i have do i think it's too much yes the sad part about this is that the day after halloween they released two halloween items on their store yeah they did which is really weird um the gengar ceramic candle thing and then the pikachu ceramic candle thing i will put okay i will say this about the stockings their stockings are 19.99 most stockings on target are 15 so the tax isn't that bad on those you're paying four bucks more for pikachu so it's not a terrible break question of the week greg all right question of the week come on let's finally hear the question i feel like you've done that before no maybe but i wasn't going to prep anything great for you because you skipping every time all right this is from katherine will there be a question of the week this week's show because i refuse to answer that question there are other questions in that list uh what if what if catherine asked if you had to pitch a pokemon roguelike what would you have the game loop be like could somebody please define what a roguelike is because i'm never 100 certain on what that means so roguelike games i believe is you run that's like an action adventure type game it's like a rogue legacy a hades a uh and it's you go and if you die or lose you are reset to the beginning with nothing and you start over again so what is the loop so what what that's what they're asking is what's the loop what would be going through and getting to the end and then starting back over again if you died in there also the roguelike is supposed to be different every time you play it right splunky is another one trying to think of a roguelike that will might have played without knowing splunky games let me look to see if i can find something um hades is the popular one that just came out nope technically pokemon mystery dungeon is a roguelike ah [Music] dead cells slay the spire uh binding of isaac i still don't understand what the loop means just i don't know don't starve i think i'm qualified to answer this question so the loop is so like in mystery dungeon you think you run through the dungeon with just what you bring in there and when you leave the dungeon those all go back into a pool and then you pick things up again and then you go to the next thing so the loop is you go through a section and then you go back to a home base and then you pick where to go next that sort of like the roguelike is you take a certain amount of things to a location and try to get to that location and if you lose in there you get sent back with nothing if you win you take the treasures back they go into a thing and then you can build that up again to take it somewhere else so we've already had a pokemon roguelike yeah i mean mystery dungeon is that but if there was gonna be another one yeah but what about what if it was good i'm leaving that one there i'm not commenting on your hatred um i would like see i think it'd be interesting to have a a snap like game where you pick x amount of pokemon and you go to an area with those and then you catch them and then they go to your professor pen and then you pick from there to go to the next like grasslands like like somewhat misreduction except you're the trainer and you're picking your team of various of various pokemon to go to a certain location like for a lava things i'm going to take all water and then and then if you get knocked out those pokemon that you rented are released to the wild and then you have to go back and try to go through with what you had and try to go to earlier dungeons to rebuild your pokemon pool so i would say my version um in in hearing all of this information and everything would be called dynamaxx adventure and you'd start out and you'd rent a pokemon and you'd go through the dungeon and you could collect pokemon as you go through the dungeon but you only get to keep one when you finish i mean dynamic adventure is a roguelike section of that game yeah i wouldn't like i wouldn't say it's like a hardco it's like it has it has rogue-like mechanics right have you ever played darkest dungeon yeah well do you ever play darkest dungeon because that's a hybrid no i have not okay dead cells is my my favorite roguelike and the thing about dead cells is like when you die obviously you start over um but when you go through and you you can only hold two different weapons and so when you knock out an enemy or when you open treasure chests which everything's randomized every time you go through you might get weapons that you get to pick and choose right like i want a bow and arrow and a shield or i want two swords or i want a sword and a hammer or i love having the hammers but the game isn't dropping me hammers so i guess i have to use um like a a knife which is different than a sword so i it would be cool if uh if i have to be put on the spot to design a game where you might have some choice at the beginning of like maybe i want these pokemon maybe i want to fire pokemon maybe i want to water pokemon but when you're going through the loot boxes will let you learn different moves like if i was a charizard i could learn flamethrower but i can only remember like four moves at once so then i come through and i can have rockslide but then i go through and it's like well i don't have room for rock slide flamethrower scratch and snarl so charger can't learn snarl but now i have overheat but that does damage to me but it does more damage should be cool too that's the only thing i could think of is instead of randomizing your weapons like a lot of these games do you randomize what your pokemon can learn although i don't think i don't think well does mystery dungeon have it where if you like completely fail you lose everything yeah if you don't get rescued then you do lose a bunch of stuff out of your back okay because that's the big thing about roguelikes is like yep if you lose you lose it all but you can and like dead cells be like uh i'm going to i'm i'm canceling out this run to you know take the money back and put in my bank because i don't want to lose all the money and i don't think i can keep going i heard hades is very good that's what i've heard hades is amazing that's the newest uh road i'm trying to think there are some roguelike board games out there and i'm trying to think of pandemic legacy don't know if that i don't think so uh well what's our pokemon of the week well last week's pokemon uh all i need to say to remind everybody of it was it should be dark type and it's not it's chatter it should be a darkness that's hot should be dark type because it was banned for so long because of foul language i'll play on that chat it's giraffe rig giraffe i took so much heat for this man there are so many giraffe rig fans out there man they are ready to defend that little guy to the end of time with little help cannot agree with you it should be dark you do agree with me or you don't agree with me i do it's booty is dark it's front is not yes um that's and that's one of the arguments i had was like if you didn't want it to look like it should be dark type then make the back end pink and make that little head a little less angry looking yeah it's i don't think i've ever seen its tail not be angry ooh shiny jurassic has a blue nose yeah stronger japanese cool i got one in pearl why i don't know i was doing pokey radar and i got one release it it's no good nah he's cute he's weak to dark and bug early designs he had a full full giraffe head as its second half see that would be cool yeah that would make sense because if it's kind of his name is palindromic much like the episode number yeah even in like gold and silver it's like its tail has a small brain of its own beware if you get close it might react to your scent and bite you yeah biting is bad yeah and bite is also a dark type move it comes right before crunch that's right 10 chance to flinch no thirty thirty n bite and then i think ten percent to lower special defense on crunch uh i think traffic is fine i think he's all right he's fine the very cute shuffle icon but it's only of its front head and not of its butt head yeah is there any trivia on draft freak i gave it i gave it to you in the original design it was a giraffe on both ends it was giraffes all the way down there you go all right well this week's pokemon we're getting a poem get feeling a little artistic this week so and that's i know people are gonna hate it here we go thin and supple floating in the wind are you origami not the lawnmower not electric that is your brother your brother falsely named a tree you are the grass one not a pokemon but are you anything but beastly if you were you'd be the seed the thorn not the drawn sword there you go that's enough y'all it's so easy all right it's all in there like i said if you're listening to this on
