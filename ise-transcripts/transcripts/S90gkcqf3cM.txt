also parody is covered so you can sing a (2:37 - 2:40)
song (2:39 - 2:44)

i have (3:25 - 3:29)
studying lawyering any opinions that (3:26 - 3:31)
they have are based on old precedent and (3:29 - 3:33)

wave ask lawyers do you have a degree in (3:33 - 3:37)
lawyering (3:37 - 3:42)
is that your new website ask (3:37 - 3:42)
asklawyers.com well i mean it just all (3:42 - 3:46)
goes back to the case of ariana versus (3:44 - 3:47)
mayberry (3:46 - 3:49)

netflix.com and you were like (5:16 - 5:20)
man i want to make a website that's like (5:18 - 5:22)
what's on netflix i feel like you could (5:20 - 5:23)
maybe (5:22 - 5:24)
i feel like you could maybe get back to (5:23 - 5:26)
the drawing board and just kind of work (5:24 - 5:29)
work work some titles here okay this is (5:26 - 5:30)
even worse (5:29 - 5:32)
i just did what's on netflix.com as one (5:30 - 5:34)
word (5:32 - 5:36)
and it directs me to the hyphenated (5:34 - 5:37)
website (5:36 - 5:40)
you have the domain for the (5:37 - 5:42)
non-hyphenated version and you went for (5:40 - 5:44)
the hyphenated version (5:42 - 5:46)
why are we reading from these people (5:44 - 5:48)
they are not trustworthy i'm only (5:46 - 5:49)
reading because (5:48 - 5:52)
they're like a lot of it's hard to mess (5:49 - 5:55)
up this news number one number two is i (5:52 - 5:59)
look the name was so good (5:55 - 5:59)
somebody is pouring their heart and soul (6:01 - 6:06)
into this website so let's give them (6:02 - 6:09)
but like you have the one that people (6:06 - 6:10)
want to type in (6:09 - 6:12)
all right all right is this about (6:10 - 6:13)
pokemon journeys part three coming to (6:12 - 6:16)
netflix on december 2020 that's that's (6:13 - 6:17)
literally the news yeah (6:16 - 6:19)
okay that's the wait that went way too (6:17 - 6:20)
fast i do (6:19 - 6:24)
who what the the next 12 (6:20 - 6:26)
episodes uh part three of pokemon (6:24 - 6:27)
journeys (6:26 - 6:30)
uh are is coming to netflix in the us (6:27 - 6:32)
because remember not every (6:30 - 6:34)
netflix provider in every country (6:32 - 6:36)
carries pokemon journeys (6:34 - 6:38)
so the next 12 episodes of pokemon (6:36 - 6:39)
journeys in the net (6:38 - 6:42)
united states netflix comes out on (6:39 - 6:43)
december (6:42 - 6:46)
4th of the year and it didn't like the (6:43 - 6:48)
it didn't really end with a cliffhanger (6:46 - 6:50)
so it's not like yeah (6:48 - 6:51)
it's not like we're waiting on anything (6:50 - 6:54)
for in particular but i do think (6:51 - 6:56)
the tagline should be the journey starts (6:54 - 6:57)
tomorrow (6:56 - 6:58)
yeah i think we have to wait until (6:57 - 7:01)
december well i mean when you're writing (6:58 - 7:03)
a premiere website like what's on (7:01 - 7:04)
netflix (7:03 - 7:06)
sometimes you're just put you're pumping (7:04 - 7:07)
out news so fast that you don't have (7:06 - 7:08)
time to dwell (7:07 - 7:12)
on a good valid title true (7:08 - 7:15)
although i will say i've enjoyed the 24 (7:12 - 7:16)
episodes (7:15 - 7:18)
so far yeah i think uh i would say maybe (7:16 - 7:20)
just a handful of them were (7:18 - 7:22)
were kind of boring skippable yeah i (7:20 - 7:23)
mean there's (7:22 - 7:27)
not been a ton of filler but we're not (7:23 - 7:28)
they're they're they are sort of (7:27 - 7:30)
dragging these out so maybe there won't (7:28 - 7:32)
be a lot of filler because they're (7:30 - 7:33)
taking their time with it or (7:32 - 7:35)
we just haven't gotten to the fiddler (7:33 - 7:36)
things you know where (7:35 - 7:39)
ash finds another krabby and then has to (7:36 - 7:41)
be like do i keep this crabby or does (7:39 - 7:42)
that crabby go and then there's a whole (7:41 - 7:43)
episode about (7:42 - 7:45)
crabby sizes again did we ever talk (7:43 - 7:46)
about (7:45 - 7:49)
like there's like an episode that's like (7:46 - 7:50)
98 percent (7:49 - 7:52)
go catching things it's like very early (7:50 - 7:54)
on (7:52 - 7:56)
we didn't but yes there is a filler (7:54 - 7:57)
episode where it's just like (7:56 - 8:00)
constantly flying pokeballs and for like (7:57 - 8:01)
20 some years you (8:00 - 8:05)
i've wondered why like well ash doesn't (8:01 - 8:07)
catch a lot of pokemon but that's like (8:05 - 8:10)
kind of fine because like like that's a (8:07 - 8:12)
lot of people like some people play (8:10 - 8:13)
through a pokemon game and they run into (8:12 - 8:15)
a fur fruit and they go ah (8:13 - 8:17)
maybe next time i'm running like i'm (8:15 - 8:18)
moving i mean there are some people who (8:17 - 8:20)
play pokemon games with literally one (8:18 - 8:21)
pokemon (8:20 - 8:24)
yeah and just they never catch any ash (8:21 - 8:26)
is not one to catch every single pokemon (8:24 - 8:28)
but that's okay but then but you think (8:26 - 8:30)
of like what if there was an episode (8:28 - 8:31)
where ash catches like (8:30 - 8:34)
maybe two when ash catches one pokemon (8:31 - 8:37)
that's an episode you're like oh boy (8:34 - 8:38)
what if there was like an episode where (8:37 - 8:40)
he caught two or three and then the (8:38 - 8:41)
pokemon company was like (8:40 - 8:43)
we're gonna make an episode where go (8:41 - 8:45)
catches like 40 pokemon (8:43 - 8:47)
and then on paper you go that sounds (8:45 - 8:49)
awesome in execution that episode is (8:47 - 8:50)
kind of boring (8:49 - 8:53)
well it's just literally there's they (8:50 - 8:54)
don't have go battle (8:53 - 8:57)
ever or incredibly rarely to weaken them (8:54 - 8:57)
it's just (8:57 - 9:01)
literally go throwing balls wherever he (8:57 - 9:01)
goes (9:01 - 9:03)
he's just just like oh there's something (9:01 - 9:04)
chuck there's something (9:03 - 9:08)
chuck it's a weird episode yeah it's (9:04 - 9:09)
just (9:08 - 9:11)
i like the fact that he catches a lot i (9:09 - 9:13)
sort of wish that (9:11 - 9:15)
more often than not there was at least a (9:13 - 9:16)
little like (9:15 - 9:19)
battling to like break up the constant (9:16 - 9:20)
i'm just gonna (9:19 - 9:23)
check a pokeball and hope it catches and (9:20 - 9:25)
those pokeballs work a lot better for go (9:23 - 9:28)
than they do for anybody else (9:25 - 9:31)
oh i when i was trying to catch that (9:28 - 9:33)
calorics do i i think i went through (9:31 - 9:34)
like 40 pokeballs (9:33 - 9:37)
oh yeah i just i i literally ended up (9:34 - 9:38)
catching (9:37 - 9:41)
him in it in a in a timer ball (9:38 - 9:44)
the the saddest of all balls timer ball (9:41 - 9:45)
looks good (9:44 - 9:47)
and like clocks come out of it when you (9:45 - 9:48)
throw it that's true (9:47 - 9:51)
which makes it makes it very clear to (9:48 - 9:51)
everyone (9:51 - 9:54)
that hey i gave up trying to get this in (9:51 - 9:55)
a good ball (9:54 - 9:57)
and i got it in the timer ball did (9:55 - 9:58)
people just forget that legendaries are (9:57 - 10:00)
hard to catch like this is a very common (9:58 - 10:01)
thing i hear (10:00 - 10:03)
is like oh it's so hard to catch (10:01 - 10:06)
calorics or reggie elike (10:03 - 10:09)
the last few legendaries and games were (10:06 - 10:11)
vital to the story so they were a lot (10:09 - 10:12)
easier to catch (10:11 - 10:14)
that's yeah it was a lot easier to catch (10:12 - 10:15)
solgaleo (10:14 - 10:20)
and lunala and uh whatever it was for (10:15 - 10:23)
why but the the real (10:20 - 10:24)
deal the real scandal that you're (10:23 - 10:27)
missing here is that they gave me a (10:24 - 10:29)
master ball (10:27 - 10:33)
but but god forbid i actually ever use (10:29 - 10:35)
a master ball in a pokemon nobody ever (10:33 - 10:36)
uses master balls no (10:35 - 10:38)
because that's the highest of all shames (10:36 - 10:39)
next to using a timer ball (10:38 - 10:42)
that is the [ __ ] that is shameful like (10:39 - 10:44)
he you you always save the mask (10:42 - 10:47)
master ball for for something that you (10:44 - 10:49)
don't want to fail but with calorics you (10:47 - 10:50)
can't (10:49 - 10:52)
fail it if you knock him out he just (10:50 - 10:53)
shows back up (10:52 - 10:54)
oh i know you don't even have to battle (10:53 - 10:56)
the elite four again yeah he's right (10:54 - 10:57)
he's just like right there (10:56 - 11:00)
um well that was fun uh i want to try (10:57 - 11:01)
that again (11:00 - 11:05)
because i won't join you story wise (11:01 - 11:07)
i will still make you spend i think i (11:05 - 11:08)
spent (11:07 - 11:11)
30 luxury balls to get into luxury ball (11:08 - 11:14)
although i was very happy (11:11 - 11:17)
spoiler spoiler spoiler that when i (11:14 - 11:18)
split (11:17 - 11:21)
the horse and calorics they were both in (11:18 - 11:22)
luxury balls (11:21 - 11:24)
oh yeah i mean this isn't a spoiler it's (11:22 - 11:26)
on pokemon's official website (11:24 - 11:30)
i mean they were both in timer balls (11:26 - 11:32)
but i was i was concerned that was going (11:30 - 11:33)
to be a shed ninja thing (11:32 - 11:36)
oh where one defaults to pokeball yeah (11:33 - 11:36)
and it (11:36 - 11:40)
wasn't and i was like yes small details (11:36 - 11:42)
nobody ever uses the master ball for (11:40 - 11:44)
anything ever no (11:42 - 11:47)
no you can use it on like you can use it (11:44 - 11:50)
nobody ever have you used we all know (11:47 - 11:52)
you used a master ball you're a fool i (11:50 - 11:52)
have (11:52 - 11:54)
literally never used a master ball in my (11:52 - 11:56)
entire pokemon career (11:54 - 11:58)
let me tell you well one of your (11:56 - 12:00)
favorite games black and white (11:58 - 12:03)
i had the master ball i was hunting for (12:00 - 12:04)
a shiny (12:03 - 12:08)
boofy on route 8 double encounter method (12:04 - 12:10)
no charm because the shiny charm didn't (12:08 - 12:12)
exist it wasn't introduced until black (12:10 - 12:13)
and black too white too (12:12 - 12:16)
and i went up and down up and down up (12:13 - 12:17)
and down (12:16 - 12:21)
14 000 encounters 15 000 encounters 16 (12:17 - 12:24)
000 encounters looking for my boof (12:21 - 12:26)
and i found a hurtier and let me tell (12:24 - 12:27)
you (12:26 - 12:29)
i never planned on playing black and (12:27 - 12:31)
white at least that copy of that came (12:29 - 12:32)
again (12:31 - 12:35)
and heard your new roar and it knew take (12:32 - 12:35)
down (12:35 - 12:37)
and it knew a lot of things to kill (12:35 - 12:40)
itself and or forced to end that battle (12:37 - 12:41)
you better believe i threw that master (12:40 - 12:44)
ball (12:41 - 12:44)
for a shiny hurtier oh yeah (12:44 - 12:50)
yeah i didn't spend all that time for (12:48 - 12:51)
the thing to (12:50 - 12:55)
roar me away sound proof (12:51 - 12:57)
uh i'm i think i had a soundproof (12:55 - 12:58)
pokemon but then the other problem is (12:57 - 13:00)
then it starts (12:58 - 13:03)
take downing and then recoils itself (13:00 - 13:05)
there ain't no soundproof ghost pokemon (13:03 - 13:06)
that it ain't gonna (13:05 - 13:08)
it ain't gonna come through asleep it (13:06 - 13:10)
just sleeps there there were a lot of (13:08 - 13:11)
things you could have done but you took (13:10 - 13:13)
the easy way out you took the coward's (13:11 - 13:13)
way (13:13 - 13:17)
okay but what am i supposed to do with a (13:13 - 13:19)
master ball in a ten-year-old game (13:17 - 13:22)
what am i saving it for at that point (13:19 - 13:24)

that is a plate that is not intended to (13:47 - 13:52)
be eaten off of (13:50 - 13:54)
that's the master ball is the pokeball (13:52 - 13:55)
that is not (13:54 - 13:59)
intended to catch pokemon (13:55 - 14:02)
it is fancy it is nice to look at (13:59 - 14:05)
do not use it do not eat off my (14:02 - 14:07)
porchester plate please (14:05 - 14:10)
the master ball is proof that you got to (14:07 - 14:11)
a certain level (14:10 - 14:13)
that they said yes you are a pokemon (14:11 - 14:14)
master (14:13 - 14:17)
here is our commemorative ball but do (14:14 - 14:18)
not ever use this (14:17 - 14:22)
it is for display purposes (14:18 - 14:22)
and you're too afraid of being a true (14:23 - 14:27)
master trainer and catching your herdier (14:25 - 14:31)
the normal way a premiere ball if you (14:27 - 14:32)
want to be possible (14:31 - 14:34)
right now i threw a master ball at a (14:32 - 14:36)
snorlax and let's go pikachu let's go (14:34 - 14:37)
eevee cause it was shiny and i was (14:36 - 14:40)
afraid it was gonna run (14:37 - 14:40)
sometimes you gotta let sometimes you (14:41 - 14:45)
just gotta accept the luck (14:44 - 14:46)
throw the master ball and move on with (14:45 - 14:48)
life all right it just shows the (14:46 - 14:50)
difference in our upbringing yeah (14:48 - 14:52)
you're telling me you would let a shiny (14:50 - 14:55)
snorlax run away from immediate (14:52 - 14:57)
rather than ever use a master ball yes i (14:55 - 14:58)
am bougie like that (14:57 - 15:02)
yes i i have learned (14:58 - 15:05)
to wait and be patient to (15:02 - 15:09)
get things the way that i want them (15:05 - 15:12)
not this quick easy millennial (15:09 - 15:14)
whatever's fine just chuck the ball and (15:12 - 15:15)
move on with my life i can't be (15:14 - 15:18)
bothered to do things properly this is (15:15 - 15:19)
this is what's wrong with your (15:18 - 15:19)
generation (15:19 - 15:27)
grace and decorum (15:19 - 15:30)
oh anyways the journey starts (15:27 - 15:33)
december 4th again i mean it already (15:30 - 15:34)
started the journey continues (15:33 - 15:38)
okay so uh we talked about calorics and (15:34 - 15:41)
uh glat glass deer glace deer (15:38 - 15:43)
lace i heard somebody say victory or the (15:41 - 15:45)
good one i heard somebody say (15:43 - 15:48)
glacier like the ier (15:45 - 15:50)
makes an a sound i don't know if this (15:48 - 15:52)
was france in the same (15:50 - 15:55)
french believe me if there's one thing (15:52 - 15:56)
you want to learn about the united (15:55 - 15:58)
kingdom is they will not pronounce (15:56 - 16:00)
french words properly so they will (15:58 - 16:02)
never lose they will never say ea they (16:00 - 16:03)
say (16:02 - 16:05)
ballot for the ballet they say fill it (16:03 - 16:07)
for a filet (16:05 - 16:10)
but they would not say glacier (16:07 - 16:13)
this isn't kalos this is galler we got (16:10 - 16:16)
hard r's in this country (16:13 - 16:16)
uh we'll have to talk to our al (16:16 - 16:22)
correspondent make sure the uh hard r's (16:19 - 16:24)
are still (16:22 - 16:27)
ask ask al ask stuart to ask anybody (16:24 - 16:30)
in that country if they say ballot or (16:27 - 16:31)
ballet (16:30 - 16:33)
and they will say ballot they say (16:31 - 16:34)
phillip (16:33 - 16:37)
or filet they always say fill it so (16:34 - 16:39)
anyways we have ice horse and ghost (16:37 - 16:41)
horse i think is what most people refer (16:39 - 16:41)
to them because (16:41 - 16:44)
no one knows how to say these names so (16:41 - 16:45)
we talked about these last week (16:44 - 16:48)
uh and the reason i was (16:45 - 16:51)
i was one comfortable with talking about (16:48 - 16:53)
them last week is because the dlc is (16:51 - 16:56)
one i would argue (16:53 - 16:59)
way shorter than the crowd the isle of (16:56 - 16:59)
armor (16:59 - 17:03)
story wise uh (16:59 - 17:03)
depends on how you approach it i think (17:03 - 17:06)
they're pretty equal story-wise yeah (17:05 - 17:09)
there's not a lot to that cub food story (17:06 - 17:11)
yeah but i think that the the beats in (17:09 - 17:13)
between can take longer (17:11 - 17:16)
like like yeah they forced you to spread (17:13 - 17:16)
that out more (17:16 - 17:18)
yes and they don't in here because (17:16 - 17:19)
there's more things to do here (17:18 - 17:22)
right and this you you find the calorics (17:19 - 17:23)
you (17:22 - 17:25)
um talk to them you ride your bike to (17:23 - 17:26)
well you (17:25 - 17:28)
you go into the town you talk to five (17:26 - 17:29)
people you talk to him you (17:28 - 17:32)
you get the carrot you plant the carrot (17:29 - 17:33)
you go to the tower (17:32 - 17:35)
you're done that's like the gist of the (17:33 - 17:36)
story (17:35 - 17:38)
so if you if you got if you wanted to (17:36 - 17:40)
experience the story first (17:38 - 17:41)
you could probably do that whole story (17:40 - 17:44)
in less than 45 minutes about 15 yeah (17:41 - 17:46)
or so minutes into the story you see (17:44 - 17:48)
these horses whichever one you decide to (17:46 - 17:49)
go with the (17:48 - 17:52)
ghost or the ice yep i was also (17:49 - 17:54)
confident last week that we talked about (17:52 - 17:55)
it that the pokemon company would talk (17:54 - 17:57)
about these horses (17:55 - 17:59)
before the players cup 2 which took (17:57 - 18:01)
place this weekend because (17:59 - 18:03)
these horses are very good and they're (18:01 - 18:04)
allowed (18:03 - 18:07)
in official competition so kind of (18:04 - 18:09)
putting two and two together (18:07 - 18:10)
you know it's been a couple weeks since (18:09 - 18:13)
the dlc there's this competition coming (18:10 - 18:14)
up where they're allowing these two (18:13 - 18:16)
horses that they haven't talked about (18:14 - 18:18)
yet i was very confident that us talking (18:16 - 18:20)
about them last week would (18:18 - 18:22)
go into the pokemon the pokemon company (18:20 - 18:23)
obviously listened to the show and they (18:22 - 18:25)
were like oh well steve will and greg (18:23 - 18:26)
talked about the horses so yeah (18:25 - 18:29)
we can but they they officially announce (18:26 - 18:30)
these horses (18:29 - 18:34)
so no no surprises here uh but there is (18:30 - 18:34)
the (18:34 - 18:37)
last glastrier and spectrier and then (18:34 - 18:38)
there is the (18:37 - 18:42)
they can merge with calorics or when you (18:38 - 18:43)
initially catch it in the game they're (18:42 - 18:47)
already merged to ice rider calorics and (18:43 - 18:47)
shadow (18:47 - 18:50)
rider calorics are the official titles (18:47 - 18:52)
they love their fusions (18:50 - 18:55)
this is how many games in a row necrozma (18:52 - 18:57)
fusion (18:55 - 18:59)
did x and y x and y did not have a (18:57 - 19:01)
fusion no (18:59 - 19:03)
no possibly zygarde was supposed to fuse (19:01 - 19:04)
but (19:03 - 19:06)
yeah that dude never got his day yeah (19:04 - 19:08)
zygarde has its own weird thing (19:06 - 19:12)
it has it fuses with itself oh yeah the (19:08 - 19:13)
cells (19:12 - 19:15)
yeah i don't know that that counts (19:13 - 19:18)
though black and white has their fusions (19:15 - 19:20)
we talked about their abilities last (19:18 - 19:22)
week if i remember correctly (19:20 - 19:26)
yes ice rider or sorry the rider forms (19:22 - 19:28)
i'll just call them ride reforms (19:26 - 19:32)
um they have their own abilities as well (19:28 - 19:34)
so calorics has an ability glacier and (19:32 - 19:36)
specter have an ability (19:34 - 19:38)
and then when they're merged they have (19:36 - 19:40)
another ability there that ability is (19:38 - 19:41)
called as (19:40 - 19:44)
one which is a new ability so it (19:41 - 19:46)
combines the effects of calirex's (19:44 - 19:48)
ability which is unnerved (19:46 - 19:51)
and spectre's ability of grim nay ice (19:48 - 19:53)
rider it's like chilling day (19:51 - 19:55)
yeah what a time to be alive we have a (19:53 - 19:58)
pokemon now with two abilities (19:55 - 20:01)
yeah well you know in the next pokemon (19:58 - 20:02)
game they're going to have triple type (20:01 - 20:04)
pokemon so that's that's what they're (20:02 - 20:05)
getting you ready for (20:04 - 20:07)
i'm sure there will be one pokemon that (20:05 - 20:08)
will have three types i mean dell mize (20:07 - 20:10)
is pretty close to that (20:08 - 20:12)
yeah downwards is really close to that (20:10 - 20:13)
uh what's that one move (20:12 - 20:16)
flying press i think does both flying (20:13 - 20:18)
and fighting fighting damage yeah (20:16 - 20:20)
that's not a pokemon that's a move i (20:18 - 20:21)
know but (20:20 - 20:23)
they got stuff they got saying that they (20:21 - 20:27)
have salted the waters (20:23 - 20:27)
for krabby i don't even know what that (20:27 - 20:31)
means (20:30 - 20:33)
it was me saying seed of the waters but (20:31 - 20:35)
like steve would say it oh there you go (20:33 - 20:37)
are you guys done with crown tundra are (20:35 - 20:38)
you still playing it what's what's the (20:37 - 20:38)
verb (20:38 - 20:40)
i only just shook the tree to get the (20:38 - 20:43)
birds yeah i'm still chasing birds on (20:40 - 20:45)
because i'm trying to do (20:43 - 20:47)
a little bit of mark hunting i've been (20:45 - 20:49)
super busy so i have not had a ton of (20:47 - 20:50)
time to play (20:49 - 20:51)
i want to try to get some i've been (20:50 - 20:54)
doing a bunch of dynamax adventures (20:51 - 20:56)
like i feel like this game probably (20:54 - 20:58)
needs to last (20:56 - 21:01)
a year more so i don't feel a rush (20:58 - 21:05)
to get a bunch of stuff done yeah (21:01 - 21:08)
maybe i mean omega ruby alpha sapphire (21:05 - 21:09)
had that two-year (21:08 - 21:12)
thing right yeah and i would (21:09 - 21:15)
argue that this game has more content (21:12 - 21:18)
yes (21:15 - 21:20)
yeah i mean yeah well if you add in the (21:18 - 21:22)
dlc (21:20 - 21:25)
yeah i mean i mean who's playing a year (21:22 - 21:27)
into the game and refusing to buy the (21:25 - 21:28)
dlc (21:27 - 21:30)
i mean a lot of people a lot a bunch of (21:28 - 21:32)
people aren't getting out of money like (21:30 - 21:33)
you yeah (21:32 - 21:37)
you think well one you had a long time (21:33 - 21:38)
to save up (21:37 - 21:40)
thirty dollars it's like three dollars (21:38 - 21:41)
it's like that's like a mowing (21:40 - 21:43)
sword and shield because my uncle bought (21:41 - 21:45)
it for me (21:43 - 21:48)
so unless my uncle gets me the dlc yeah (21:45 - 21:49)
they're probably (21:48 - 21:51)
kids who haven't played it yet there are (21:49 - 21:53)
probably people who are waiting because (21:51 - 21:56)
they don't have the money or not i would (21:53 - 21:58)
say kids would move on they got (21:56 - 22:01)
they have unlimited free mobile games (21:58 - 22:03)
that they can be going between (22:01 - 22:04)
i don't know if they're still applying a (22:03 - 22:07)
year into it i'm not allowed to have a (22:04 - 22:08)
mobile device (22:07 - 22:12)
yeah that is true (22:08 - 22:14)
i had to take it away you were abusing (22:12 - 22:17)
it um i wasn't getting my homework done (22:14 - 22:21)
[Laughter] (22:17 - 22:24)
in in my neck of the world (22:21 - 22:26)
see you thought myself (22:24 - 22:35)
[Laughter] (22:26 - 22:37)
my neck of the woods i think is the (22:35 - 22:38)
actual (22:37 - 22:41)
yeah there you go congrats (22:38 - 22:45)
it seems like people that i have (22:41 - 22:47)
interacted with which is a very small (22:45 - 22:48)
sample of pokemon fans (22:47 - 22:50)
out of all of the pokemon fans i don't (22:48 - 22:52)
want to (22:50 - 22:54)
i understand that this is a nut this (22:52 - 22:56)
could be a nutshell (22:54 - 22:59)
uh evaluation here um they seemed (22:56 - 23:02)
more excited and more happy with the (22:59 - 23:03)
crown tundra (23:02 - 23:05)
uh and that's i think mostly because (23:03 - 23:07)
like dynamics adventure and being able (23:05 - 23:09)
to catch the legends and new legends (23:07 - 23:12)
and and whatnot compared to the isle of (23:09 - 23:15)
armor which was very competitive focused (23:12 - 23:18)
correct it just seems like people are (23:15 - 23:18)
were (23:18 - 23:21)
have been over the crown tundra quicker (23:18 - 23:23)
than they were over the olive armor (23:21 - 23:26)
what do you mean by over uh it just (23:23 - 23:27)
seems like they got their fill and (23:26 - 23:28)
they've moved on to different games (23:27 - 23:30)
whereas with the isle of armor it just (23:28 - 23:32)
seems like (23:30 - 23:35)
they kind of kept going with it um (23:32 - 23:37)
i don't know i'm still doing dynamaxx (23:35 - 23:39)
adventures a couple of nights a week (23:37 - 23:43)
so until i get a full every legendary as (23:39 - 23:44)
a shiny (23:43 - 23:46)
i'm gonna keep at it i think they (23:44 - 23:47)
extended the life of viola (23:46 - 23:49)
armor because they did a bunch of they (23:47 - 23:51)
did a bunch of events that did max right (23:49 - 23:53)
stuff (23:51 - 23:54)
to fill in the time frame where we just (23:53 - 23:56)
haven't had that we had the halloween (23:54 - 23:58)
event and then (23:56 - 23:59)
if you're not heavily into dynamics (23:58 - 24:01)
adventures or you ran through them and (23:59 - 24:02)
you're not shining hunting there's just (24:01 - 24:03)
not a lot (24:02 - 24:05)
there's not more to do and the the other (24:03 - 24:06)
problem (24:05 - 24:10)
in my opinion is that even though (24:06 - 24:12)
i like the new wild area there's nothing (24:10 - 24:14)
exciting in the new wild area (24:12 - 24:18)
compared to what i think the initial ex (24:14 - 24:21)
impression of the isle of armor which (24:18 - 24:24)
a lot of it was water but there were so (24:21 - 24:26)
many new pokemon walking around (24:24 - 24:29)
and yeah unfortunately as it turns out (24:26 - 24:32)
in the crown tundra over half of that (24:29 - 24:34)
pokedex is legendaries (24:32 - 24:37)
yeah i think you don't have a lot of (24:34 - 24:38)
variety (24:37 - 24:40)
you see a lot of old pokemon in the (24:38 - 24:43)
crown tundra which doesn't make it like (24:40 - 24:47)
maybe that like ex explorer worthy (24:43 - 24:50)
well it's the same problem that will had (24:47 - 24:50)
right (24:50 - 24:52)
i have a problem we had a problem with (24:50 - 24:53)
the first game is that you were (24:52 - 24:55)
like when you hit the wild area and (24:53 - 24:56)
you're seeing a bunch of old pokemon (24:55 - 24:57)
that you'd already seen before (24:56 - 24:59)
yeah i think people were expecting to (24:57 - 25:02)
see a lot more (24:59 - 25:05)
older pokemon in crown tundra and that (25:02 - 25:06)
just didn't manifest and in fact that (25:05 - 25:07)
first day (25:06 - 25:09)
i saw a lot of things that had already (25:07 - 25:10)
caught (25:09 - 25:13)
filling the pokedex for crown tundra (25:10 - 25:13)
does not (25:13 - 25:16)
feel like i can spend a lot of time (25:13 - 25:17)
hearing catching things (25:16 - 25:20)
no because it's it's really i have to do (25:17 - 25:22)
all of these legendary things and that's (25:20 - 25:24)
a shiny hunting thing (25:22 - 25:26)
and so and the legendaries don't even (25:24 - 25:27)
matter for the decks (25:26 - 25:30)
right so it's just like well i mean like (25:27 - 25:32)
the ones in dynamics adventure sorry (25:30 - 25:35)
right so there's like just not a lot (25:32 - 25:37)
of collecting really to be done it (25:35 - 25:39)
didn't feel like they had (25:37 - 25:43)
expanded that dex by a lot (25:39 - 25:46)
yeah i had more fun catching (25:43 - 25:48)
gosh well i i i think the catching in (25:46 - 25:50)
isle of armor was better (25:48 - 25:52)
like exploring the olive armor catching (25:50 - 25:54)
everything to fill the decks i think was (25:52 - 25:56)
dramatically better than the crown (25:54 - 25:58)
tundra and this is you know i love (25:56 - 25:58)
catching (25:58 - 26:01)
but at a certain point with crown tundra (25:58 - 26:02)
i was like (26:01 - 26:04)
electabuzz only appears like three days (26:02 - 26:06)
out of the week (26:04 - 26:08)
and i guess i could just like take the (26:06 - 26:10)
one electavire i found earlier and take (26:08 - 26:12)
it to the daycare and spin in a circle (26:10 - 26:14)
and breed it and then evolve it (26:12 - 26:17)
or i can just connect my pokemon home (26:14 - 26:20)
and then move over the electabuzz (26:17 - 26:22)
because like there wasn't other it (26:20 - 26:24)
wasn't because (26:22 - 26:27)
like i don't mind waiting like the three (26:24 - 26:28)
days or the (26:27 - 26:30)
whatever for thunderstorms to appear for (26:28 - 26:32)
electabuzz to appear (26:30 - 26:33)
it was there was really nothing else to (26:32 - 26:35)
catch (26:33 - 26:37)
yeah whereas in like the isle of armor (26:35 - 26:38)
if it was like oh well polly toad only (26:37 - 26:40)
appears when it's raining and it's like (26:38 - 26:41)
okay well i know it's raining tomorrow (26:40 - 26:43)
and i still have like 40 other pokemon (26:41 - 26:44)
to catch so i'll just work on those 40 (26:43 - 26:45)
pokemon and then (26:44 - 26:47)
because i know i won't finish that and (26:45 - 26:48)
then tomorrow will be raining and i'll (26:47 - 26:49)
find the polytoad and they'll be good (26:48 - 26:51)
how do you know it's going to be raining (26:49 - 26:53)
tomorrow are you a meteorologist (26:51 - 26:56)
yeah that's the i went to sonia (26:53 - 26:59)
and i said look let me know when polly (26:56 - 27:00)
toad's spawning and she's like here's (26:59 - 27:02)
the here's our book on meteorology (27:00 - 27:05)
the diglett stuff as much as we complain (27:02 - 27:06)
took a lot of time (27:05 - 27:10)
and it was way more tedious than the uh (27:06 - 27:13)
i still haven't completed it oh me (27:10 - 27:13)
either (27:13 - 27:15)
and i haven't completed the footprints i (27:13 - 27:17)
have the worst time finding verizon's (27:15 - 27:18)
footprints (27:17 - 27:20)
because i can't visually really see the (27:18 - 27:21)
difference (27:20 - 27:23)
and i keep going up to sets of rocks (27:21 - 27:25)
because they are much more visibly (27:23 - 27:26)
different and going oh (27:25 - 27:29)
oh it's a pair of rocks okay so where's (27:26 - 27:30)
the footprints (27:29 - 27:32)
all right i don't think it's a big deal (27:30 - 27:34)
i just wanted to bring up that i just (27:32 - 27:35)
felt (27:34 - 27:38)
like people are already over (27:35 - 27:41)
crown tundra compared to what seemed to (27:38 - 27:42)
be (27:41 - 27:46)
decent legs on an earlier dlc that (27:42 - 27:50)
was more focused for ev training and ivy (27:46 - 27:51)
training and (27:50 - 27:53)
and you know maybe dipping your toe into (27:51 - 27:56)
battling whereas this is more of (27:53 - 28:00)
i i think it varies a lot and i know a (27:56 - 28:01)
lot of people who (28:00 - 28:03)
just caught everything the crown timer (28:01 - 28:05)
and i'm not a crown tender but i love (28:03 - 28:06)
armor and we're done (28:05 - 28:08)
like i didn't play a lot of vile armor i (28:06 - 28:10)
didn't complete half the stuff over (28:08 - 28:11)
there because (28:10 - 28:14)
much of it was for competitive and i'm (28:11 - 28:16)
playing a lot of crown tender because (28:14 - 28:17)
there's a lot of things to do and the (28:16 - 28:19)
dynamics adventures are super fun (28:17 - 28:21)
um i think it really varies what people (28:19 - 28:23)
wanted to get out of it (28:21 - 28:26)
i also think we are a year into the game (28:23 - 28:28)
and the dlc (28:26 - 28:31)
is very good but i don't think it added (28:28 - 28:33)
enough of what people (28:31 - 28:35)
wanted outside of dynamics adventures (28:33 - 28:37)
yeah agreed (28:35 - 28:39)
like they really like they had i said (28:37 - 28:40)
this last time i said again like they (28:39 - 28:41)
had a chance to really (28:40 - 28:44)
expand the pokedex more (28:41 - 28:47)
and they just they just didn't which is (28:44 - 28:49)
fine but it does limit the appeal of (28:47 - 28:50)
when you're there and like (28:49 - 28:52)
oh i see all these fossil ones right in (28:50 - 28:54)
this first area and that's really cool (28:52 - 28:55)
and then (28:54 - 28:56)
you go to the next area and it's (28:55 - 28:58)
literally everything you've already (28:56 - 28:59)
caught (28:58 - 29:00)
this is a little disheartening to have (28:59 - 29:02)
that happen when (29:00 - 29:04)
you were sort of hoping this would bring (29:02 - 29:05)
a lot more (29:04 - 29:07)
old favorites and a couple of news back (29:05 - 29:09)
and it just didn't (29:07 - 29:11)
uh i do actually have a complaint about (29:09 - 29:12)
crown tundra (29:11 - 29:16)
there we go they lock the champion star (29:12 - 29:19)
battle behind you finishing (29:16 - 29:22)
peony's quest line what's a champion oh (29:19 - 29:23)
that's right okay (29:22 - 29:26)
which is like i don't i'm not like i (29:23 - 29:29)
i i don't want to do that yet you know (29:26 - 29:30)
anyway like (29:29 - 29:33)
if i don't know what reggie i want or if (29:30 - 29:35)
i wanted to shiny hit the red jeez which (29:33 - 29:37)
they allow and you don't even have to re (29:35 - 29:38)
turn off your game (29:37 - 29:41)
uh you can knock it out it will reappear (29:38 - 29:43)
you can run away (29:41 - 29:44)
again you know we've been talking about (29:43 - 29:46)
this for over a year they clearly do not (29:44 - 29:48)
want us turning on and off our games (29:46 - 29:49)
anymore (29:48 - 29:51)
which is fine i know some people aren't (29:49 - 29:53)
happy with it i think it's fine i think (29:51 - 29:55)
it's a bad way to interact with a video (29:53 - 29:56)
game (29:55 - 29:59)
so even if you wanted to (29:56 - 30:00)
uh if you want if you weren't sure what (29:59 - 30:02)
dredge you wanted or if you were stuck (30:00 - 30:03)
in dynamics adventure (30:02 - 30:06)
or wanted a shiny hat these you have to (30:03 - 30:09)
finish the reggies you have to finish (30:06 - 30:10)
the calorics thing which i think is (30:09 - 30:12)
probably the first thing you should do (30:10 - 30:14)
since it's like the main story part of (30:12 - 30:15)
it and then you also have to do the (30:14 - 30:16)
three (30:15 - 30:20)
birds which again if you (30:16 - 30:21)
not i don't think the birds take as long (30:20 - 30:22)
as the reggie's they're shiny locked you (30:21 - 30:24)
could mark hunt them i made a mark (30:22 - 30:26)
hunting guide for the birds on youtube (30:24 - 30:29)
if you want to check that out uh but to (30:26 - 30:31)
force you to do those three things to do (30:29 - 30:34)
another thing something that is like (30:31 - 30:36)
designed for you to in my mind do (30:34 - 30:39)
like once a day the championship battle (30:36 - 30:40)
thing (30:39 - 30:43)
it's just kind of silly like i still (30:40 - 30:44)
don't know (30:43 - 30:47)
like i guess i want reggie ella key like (30:44 - 30:48)
i think i've decided that because i (30:47 - 30:50)
think it does the better competitive one (30:48 - 30:53)
um right now but like a couple days ago (30:50 - 30:54)
i was like man i just don't know which (30:53 - 30:55)
one i want and i like the (30:54 - 30:58)
the answer is well just play through the (30:55 - 30:59)
game plug i'll play through your (30:58 - 31:01)
sword version get the other one i was (30:59 - 31:03)
like yeah i get that and that takes time (31:01 - 31:04)
but (31:03 - 31:07)
i just want to try the galler start (31:04 - 31:09)
tournament and i don't want (31:07 - 31:11)
just it just seems weird that this other (31:09 - 31:12)
thing that they (31:11 - 31:15)
this other thing they added to the dlc (31:12 - 31:17)
is locked behind you doing (31:15 - 31:20)
three very time consuming things (31:17 - 31:22)
and it's not like like look you're (31:20 - 31:25)
battling npcs in a double battle it's (31:22 - 31:26)
not like it's gonna be harder difficult (31:25 - 31:28)
or like (31:26 - 31:29)
you know it's not gonna like (31:28 - 31:30)
revolutionize or change the game you're (31:29 - 31:32)
just gonna go through it you're going to (31:30 - 31:32)
see some cool (31:32 - 31:33)
dialogue you're probably going to get a (31:32 - 31:35)
bunch of money from it and then it's (31:33 - 31:36)
like oh maybe i'll do that once a day to (31:35 - 31:37)
get like (31:36 - 31:39)
gal or champion ribbon i don't even know (31:37 - 31:40)
if it assigns the gallery champion (31:39 - 31:41)
ribbon i don't know if you just have to (31:40 - 31:42)
do like single battles to get that (31:41 - 31:43)
ribbon (31:42 - 31:46)
but it just that's that seemed weird to (31:43 - 31:46)
me (31:46 - 31:49)
that they decided to do that yeah i i (31:46 - 31:50)
don't like it when they lock things (31:49 - 31:51)
behind (31:50 - 31:53)
they're not hard tasks but they are time (31:51 - 31:55)
consuming tasks they are time (31:53 - 31:56)
and especially if you want you're not a (31:55 - 31:58)
game gobbler and you want to just like (31:56 - 32:01)
enjoy the game like me like i finished (31:58 - 32:02)
all of calorics (32:01 - 32:04)
it took me a while and now i'm just (32:02 - 32:06)
starting on the birds and it's probably (32:04 - 32:07)
going to take me a week to do that and (32:06 - 32:09)
then it's going to be another week for (32:07 - 32:11)
me to do the reggie's and (32:09 - 32:13)
yeah by that time it's like doing (32:11 - 32:15)
competitive all-star blah blah (32:13 - 32:18)
and pass monster hunter rise is on the (32:15 - 32:19)
horizon so (32:18 - 32:21)
oh look if you haven't gotten to the (32:19 - 32:22)
all-star part by (32:21 - 32:26)
march i'd be very concerned no i'm just (32:22 - 32:26)
saying it's like (32:26 - 32:30)
i probably after that many weeks (32:26 - 32:32)
in crown tundra i'm going to be more (32:30 - 32:34)
inclined to go (32:32 - 32:36)
back into monster hunter generation's (32:34 - 32:37)
ultimate and get my (32:36 - 32:39)
monster hunter fix in preparation for (32:37 - 32:41)
rise than to actually worry about the (32:39 - 32:42)
all-star (32:41 - 32:44)
tournament my thought process is if the (32:42 - 32:45)
all-star tournament gives you a bunch of (32:44 - 32:47)
money and it's one of the best ways to (32:45 - 32:47)
get money (32:47 - 32:49)
that would be something i would love to (32:47 - 32:51)
do once a day (32:49 - 32:52)
are you hurting for money in this game (32:51 - 32:54)
because i'm certainly like i (32:52 - 32:58)
don't do your little daily tasks yeah (32:54 - 33:01)
i got tons of cash i have a a great (32:58 - 33:02)
portfolio (33:01 - 33:04)
of different assets in the game i have (33:02 - 33:05)
you know my like (33:04 - 33:08)
700 big nuggets and i have my (33:05 - 33:12)
400 star pieces and i have my 600 luxury (33:08 - 33:13)
balls and (33:12 - 33:15)
i i it's very diverse you know i got my (33:13 - 33:17)
big pearls (33:15 - 33:19)
i got my ball mushrooms and stuff i got (33:17 - 33:21)
i got a good supply (33:19 - 33:26)
but as i have bought a bunch of vitamins (33:21 - 33:29)
then gone to that madame cleansy or (33:26 - 33:30)
whatever her name is (33:29 - 33:32)
to so i bought a bunch of vitamins i (33:30 - 33:34)
eevee trained all my pokemon very (33:32 - 33:36)
quickly for this tournament (33:34 - 33:39)
i then needed to change (33:36 - 33:42)
some ev spreads so i had to go cleanse (33:39 - 33:42)
them for (33:42 - 33:44)
10 armored ore and then rebuy the (33:42 - 33:46)
vitamins it becomes very expensive very (33:44 - 33:47)
quickly (33:46 - 33:51)
um and if if i wasn't on a time limit (33:47 - 33:54)
like if the tournament wasn't in like (33:51 - 33:55)
when i was doing this it was monday (33:54 - 33:57)
wednesday i pretty much did it every day (33:55 - 34:00)
monday tuesday wednesday thursday (33:57 - 34:02)
if i wasn't on a time limit i would just (34:00 - 34:04)
ev train them like the old-fashioned way (34:02 - 34:05)
because it doesn't take that (34:04 - 34:08)
long to take like five pokemon and find (34:05 - 34:10)
like a knock dowel which i think is plus (34:08 - 34:11)
two hp (34:10 - 34:14)
evs and knock them out (34:11 - 34:18)
in like 15 minutes but i used to do in (34:14 - 34:20)
the old days yeah the old days but i (34:18 - 34:20)
needed (34:20 - 34:23)
a little bit more precise eevees and i (34:20 - 34:24)
was on a time limit (34:23 - 34:27)
so i bought a bunch of vitamins and you (34:24 - 34:29)
go through (34:27 - 34:31)
money very very quickly so if there was (34:29 - 34:33)
like one thing i could add to my daily (34:31 - 34:35)
rotation of you know check all these (34:33 - 34:37)
dents to get the watts (34:35 - 34:38)
shake these trees to get the apricorns (34:37 - 34:40)
because i'm still looking for (34:38 - 34:42)
you know safari balls or sports balls (34:40 - 34:44)
and then like oh it takes you know (34:42 - 34:47)
10 minutes to run through champion (34:44 - 34:50)
star galler double battle or whatever (34:47 - 34:51)
it's called (34:50 - 34:53)
that would be a nice addition to the (34:51 - 34:55)
rotation but i haven't done the regis (34:53 - 34:58)
so i can't add that to my rotation (34:55 - 35:00)
because i wasn't ready to do reggie's (34:58 - 35:00)
yet (35:00 - 35:02)
and for anyone being like why don't you (35:00 - 35:04)
just sell all your ball mushrooms and (35:02 - 35:06)
your gold nuggets and all that stuff (35:04 - 35:09)
yeah i could do that but the the (35:06 - 35:13)
problem is that the money has a cap (35:09 - 35:15)
so it would be silly to cap out the (35:13 - 35:16)
money (35:15 - 35:19)
when in my inventory i'm not near the (35:16 - 35:21)
cap of those items (35:19 - 35:23)
you mean you can only hold so much money (35:21 - 35:26)
yeah uh watts i don't think uh (35:23 - 35:29)
nine million um i don't think there's a (35:26 - 35:31)
limit on a watts (35:29 - 35:33)
but i but i don't have any watts anymore (35:31 - 35:36)
either because i spent all my watts (35:33 - 35:39)
to get wishing pieces so i could hunt (35:36 - 35:41)
for guys (35:39 - 35:43)
so i had like 4 million watts and i (35:41 - 35:45)
cashed them all in for wishing pieces (35:43 - 35:48)
so i can't even like cash in my watts (35:45 - 35:49)
for luxury balls because i spent all (35:48 - 35:51)
those because i think watts are better (35:49 - 35:52)
for wishing pieces at this point because (35:51 - 35:54)
there's other ways to get money (35:52 - 35:57)
and now my money's going into vitamins (35:54 - 35:58)
it's it's (35:57 - 36:00)
if if they've done anything right i feel (35:58 - 36:01)
like they've really (36:00 - 36:03)
done pretty well with the economy of (36:01 - 36:04)
money watts (36:03 - 36:07)
armorite uh dinite (36:04 - 36:09)
and whatever else like i think they've (36:07 - 36:12)
done a really decent battle balance for (36:09 - 36:13)
all that stuff (36:12 - 36:15)
and i gotta save my armor right because (36:13 - 36:17)
the madame cleanse lady charges like 10 (36:15 - 36:18)
for them (36:17 - 36:20)
and all the good moves are at the dojo (36:18 - 36:21)
and they cost five (36:20 - 36:23)
i think she's expensive i think 10 is a (36:21 - 36:26)
lot to reset evie's (36:23 - 36:28)
she's a ripoff and yet you still keep (36:26 - 36:30)
patronizing her business (36:28 - 36:32)
well i gotta swim out she's on an island (36:30 - 36:35)
will she doesn't even have her own (36:32 - 36:39)
roof roof over her head well maybe (36:35 - 36:44)
that's her hint to stop bugging her (36:39 - 36:46)
i'm out of this island and if you really (36:44 - 36:47)
want to see me and i really don't want (36:46 - 36:48)
you to (36:47 - 36:51)
i guess you can swim out here all right (36:48 - 36:52)
let's take a quick break (36:51 - 36:55)

unbroken bond (42:12 - 42:15)
okay you just need a welder welder is (42:15 - 42:18)
good (42:18 - 42:22)
basically this is cool i guess (42:18 - 42:25)
i i am in an unfortunate position (42:22 - 42:28)
where i don't have a store i care about (42:25 - 42:29)
nor host (42:28 - 42:32)
tcg like good like you know what i mean (42:29 - 42:32)
it's like (42:32 - 42:35)
go to your favorite board gaming store (42:32 - 42:37)
and like support them and it's like i (42:35 - 42:37)
don't (42:37 - 42:40)
have that you guys do though you guys (42:37 - 42:41)
have like a (42:40 - 42:43)
board gaming store you love i mean i'm (42:41 - 42:45)
literally looking at a board gaming (42:43 - 42:47)
store through my window right now (42:45 - 42:50)
so yes i mean yeah also the source (42:47 - 42:54)
but under pokemon team challenge find my (42:50 - 42:55)
store (42:54 - 42:57)
there are no stores yet so i couldn't (42:55 - 42:59)
even sign up right now if i wanted (42:57 - 43:02)
there's they're still trying to make uh (42:59 - 43:04)
the pokemon trading card game online (43:02 - 43:06)
work to work right (43:04 - 43:08)
i mean they haven't updated it it made (43:06 - 43:10)
it better yet right no there's a (43:08 - 43:12)
there was a um player's cup this past (43:10 - 43:13)
weekend (43:12 - 43:17)
for both the vgc and the tcg and (43:13 - 43:23)
do you if you were playing in the tcg (43:17 - 43:25)
using pokemon trading card game online (43:23 - 43:26)
the official client (43:25 - 43:30)
of the pokemon trading card game and (43:26 - 43:31)
you're winning (43:30 - 43:33)
and the game bugs out and now you it (43:31 - 43:34)
becomes (43:33 - 43:37)
unplayable do you win that match (43:34 - 43:41)
does your opponent win that match who (43:37 - 43:44)
what judge is deciding what happened (43:41 - 43:45)
because your game is (43:44 - 43:48)
so incredibly buggy that the match state (43:45 - 43:50)
has been completely stopped (43:48 - 43:52)
because of the game itself not because (43:50 - 43:53)
of the players (43:52 - 43:56)
don't know mysteries of the universe (43:53 - 43:58)
it's not good (43:56 - 44:00)
it does seem very unpleasant i like the (43:58 - 44:02)
pokemon trading card game online i think (44:00 - 44:02)
it's (44:02 - 44:03)
for the most part if you're just (44:02 - 44:05)
climbing ladder if you're just doing (44:03 - 44:05)
matches (44:05 - 44:08)
it's whatever like uh no one's putting (44:05 - 44:09)
their their like (44:08 - 44:12)
win-loss ratio from the ladder on like (44:09 - 44:13)
their linkedin profile it's not like the (44:12 - 44:15)
end of the world of the game (44:13 - 44:17)
you speak for yourself so attitude not (44:15 - 44:18)
the like (44:17 - 44:20)
the game bugs out and you lose but in an (44:18 - 44:21)
official tournament (44:20 - 44:24)
oh my gosh that would be awful rage (44:21 - 44:26)
inducing (44:24 - 44:28)
now do you think since they have until (44:26 - 44:30)
december 5th (44:28 - 44:32)
that they're going to take this time to (44:30 - 44:33)
implement (44:32 - 44:36)
vast improvements greg are you (44:33 - 44:40)
you better check your medications (44:36 - 44:40)
um i'm asking (44:40 - 44:48)
out of love for the game that i don't (44:45 - 44:50)
play (44:48 - 44:52)
you know usually if a card doesn't work (44:50 - 44:53)
they just straight up ban it for several (44:52 - 44:54)
months (44:53 - 44:58)
yup and then not get around to fixing it (44:54 - 45:00)
and when i i wish i was exaggerating (44:58 - 45:03)
when i said several months but (45:00 - 45:05)
what set was it i think it was unbroken (45:03 - 45:07)
bonds they introduced a card called (45:05 - 45:09)
fighting dojo (45:07 - 45:13)
um which added i think plus 20 damage to (45:09 - 45:14)
all fighting pokemon which made it (45:13 - 45:15)
pretty (45:14 - 45:18)
good in a hitmontop hitmonlee hitmonchan (45:15 - 45:20)
deck that all kind of worked together (45:18 - 45:22)
and right out the gate (45:20 - 45:25)
fighting dojo was broken and they banned (45:22 - 45:26)
it (45:25 - 45:29)
and it stayed banned for about three (45:26 - 45:30)
months (45:29 - 45:33)
which if you wanted to play that new (45:30 - 45:34)
card (45:33 - 45:36)
and practice on tcgo because before (45:34 - 45:38)
covid you wanted to take that deck to a (45:36 - 45:40)
tournament and that one card (45:38 - 45:42)
that is a staple in your deck is banned (45:40 - 45:43)
on the online game (45:42 - 45:47)
it's not super good play testing for (45:43 - 45:50)
your deck is there an alternate (45:47 - 45:54)
alternate there are so many main things (45:50 - 45:55)
yes (45:54 - 45:58)
but i think what you you guys are really (45:55 - 45:58)
missing (45:58 - 46:02)
is this very uh unspoken (45:58 - 46:04)
right it's the same thing with the whole (46:02 - 46:06)
like season five versus season six and (46:04 - 46:08)
the vgc (46:06 - 46:09)
where you couldn't play test because (46:08 - 46:11)
they rotated the rules and you couldn't (46:09 - 46:12)
test the bl (46:11 - 46:15)
no no no no no no no tpci does not want (46:12 - 46:16)
people play testing (46:15 - 46:18)
period done they are doing everything in (46:16 - 46:20)
their power to stop (46:18 - 46:23)
people from play testing in the vgc (46:20 - 46:26)
and in the tcg yeah it's true as a (46:23 - 46:27)
conspiracy (46:26 - 46:30)
face reality just like bubblegate (46:27 - 46:32)
needs to be answered oh i'm working on (46:30 - 46:33)
it i am working (46:32 - 46:36)
i have i am out of buy bubbles bulbasaur (46:33 - 46:38)
stickers so my next bubble store sticker (46:36 - 46:41)
that i get it's either gonna say buy or (46:38 - 46:42)
it's not and we will have cracked (46:41 - 46:46)
the case i will say that (46:42 - 46:49)
while i do believe the vgc was uh (46:46 - 46:52)
a mistake of the person not downloading (46:49 - 46:53)
the (46:52 - 46:54)
the latest rule set and then hosting the (46:53 - 46:57)
tournament with the latest rule set (46:54 - 47:00)
uh i think that is a huge difference in (46:57 - 47:04)
10 years of i don't know who to blame at (47:00 - 47:04)
this point (47:04 - 47:07)
direwolf digital or like being (47:04 - 47:09)
incompetent as a developer (47:07 - 47:11)
or except they're not they're very (47:09 - 47:12)
successful in (47:11 - 47:15)
every other aspect yeah that's what (47:12 - 47:16)
confuses me (47:15 - 47:19)
and or blaming the pokemon company for (47:16 - 47:19)
not (47:19 - 47:22)
giving direwolf digital the the the (47:19 - 47:23)
right (47:22 - 47:25)
staff the right amount of money the (47:23 - 47:26)
amount of time (47:25 - 47:29)
like sometimes just throwing money at a (47:26 - 47:29)
problem (47:29 - 47:32)
doesn't solve it and sometimes just (47:29 - 47:33)
throwing money at a problem (47:32 - 47:37)
does solve right (47:33 - 47:38)
is it like is it the situation where (47:37 - 47:41)
they that the pokemon company (47:38 - 47:44)
doesn't pay direwolf digital enough to (47:41 - 47:44)
hire (47:44 - 47:47)
more developers or is it that the (47:44 - 47:49)
developers who are working on it are (47:47 - 47:52)
like the bottom tier developers because (47:49 - 47:53)
we know that the other games direwolf (47:52 - 47:55)
digital puts out (47:53 - 47:58)
are functioning games at the end of the (47:55 - 47:58)
day (47:58 - 48:01)
what matters is that they've done two (47:58 - 48:02)
players cups (48:01 - 48:06)
through tcgo and both have been (48:02 - 48:09)
not good i would say if somebody is (48:06 - 48:11)
competing at a high level and your game (48:09 - 48:12)
bugs out and that is an (48:11 - 48:16)
irreversible game decision (48:12 - 48:18)
is an awful situation to be in as one of (48:16 - 48:19)
those players (48:18 - 48:21)
whether you are winning or you're losing (48:19 - 48:23)
and it happens to you or your opponent (48:21 - 48:25)
that is not good (48:23 - 48:27)
for both people that are qualifying in (48:25 - 48:28)
taking time (48:27 - 48:31)
training practicing competing at a high (48:28 - 48:33)
level for your video game (48:31 - 48:35)
digital card game i guess and so they've (48:33 - 48:37)
done two players cups (48:35 - 48:40)
and now they're doing this and this game (48:37 - 48:42)
is still (48:40 - 48:45)
broken uh whereas at least (48:42 - 48:47)
in the vgc where they picked the wrong (48:45 - 48:49)
well we're assuming they picked the (48:47 - 48:50)
wrong one they were supposed to pick six (48:49 - 48:51)
they picked five (48:50 - 48:54)
at least from everything i've heard (48:51 - 48:55)
everything i've experienced (48:54 - 48:57)
nothing has ever broken at a competitive (48:55 - 48:58)
level (48:57 - 49:01)
with sword and shield (48:58 - 49:04)
i know in sudden moon they had to like (49:01 - 49:06)
ban string shot for like (49:04 - 49:08)
six months because the string shot was (49:06 - 49:10)
broken (49:08 - 49:12)
but mechanically sword and shield (49:10 - 49:13)
competitive is very sound (49:12 - 49:15)
like it works it's fine i've (49:13 - 49:17)
participated in the players cup this (49:15 - 49:18)
weekend (49:17 - 49:20)
which was an awesome experience even (49:18 - 49:21)
though i lost (49:20 - 49:24)
should be very excited that i got as far (49:21 - 49:25)
as i did to even compete in the player's (49:24 - 49:27)
cup but the cool thing (49:25 - 49:28)
on top of that was i got to see how it (49:27 - 49:32)
worked and it ran through battlefly (49:28 - 49:35)
which hosts a ton of tournaments and you (49:32 - 49:37)
could see the bracket ahead of time (49:35 - 49:39)
and once the bracket went live it paired (49:37 - 49:41)
you with a person (49:39 - 49:43)
that person you had an individual text (49:41 - 49:44)
chat with you just (49:43 - 49:46)
you both decided on an eight-digit code (49:44 - 49:47)
you matched up (49:46 - 49:49)
you did your match was best two out of (49:47 - 49:51)
three you did your second match if it (49:49 - 49:53)
was 1-1 you did your third match (49:51 - 49:54)
and then the winner would report the (49:53 - 49:56)
score and (49:54 - 49:59)
it had an option to upload screenshots (49:56 - 50:01)
so whether you used your iphone or your (49:59 - 50:03)
android phone or to use the switch (50:01 - 50:07)
screenshot or i mean i uh was (50:03 - 50:10)
playing on my computer through my elgato (50:07 - 50:11)
so i was just able to screenshot (50:10 - 50:14)
my desktop you could upload the win loss (50:11 - 50:16)
ratio in the three slots (50:14 - 50:18)
and then report that to the judge and as (50:16 - 50:20)
soon as you reported it (50:18 - 50:22)
whether like if you if you if you were (50:20 - 50:23)
in the winner's bracket (50:22 - 50:25)
spoiler i wasn't if you were in the (50:23 - 50:27)
winner's bracket uh you would wait for (50:25 - 50:29)
the next pairing and the computer system (50:27 - 50:30)
would already pair you and you'd be set (50:29 - 50:32)
to go if you went into the losers (50:30 - 50:33)
bracket (50:32 - 50:34)
um you would get matched with somebody (50:33 - 50:36)
else who lost um so the tournament (50:34 - 50:37)
worked like this (50:36 - 50:39)
you know it was for north america was (50:37 - 50:41)
the top 256 players (50:39 - 50:44)
everyone had an opponent uh i think out (50:41 - 50:46)
of the top 256 (50:44 - 50:48)
10 people didn't register in time and (50:46 - 50:50)
then 10 people didn't upload their deck (50:48 - 50:51)
list in time (50:50 - 50:53)
not that well their poke their six (50:51 - 50:56)
pokemon lists 230 out of 250 people (50:53 - 50:57)
competing (50:56 - 51:00)
so a couple people got round one buys (50:57 - 51:03)
but once we got into the loser bracket (51:00 - 51:05)
it matched me up with another person (51:03 - 51:07)
and then i beat that person and then it (51:05 - 51:08)
matched me up with another person right (51:07 - 51:10)
away that was 1-1 (51:08 - 51:12)
and then that person defeated me so the (51:10 - 51:14)
tournament worked if you lost twice you (51:12 - 51:16)
were out of the tournament and at that (51:14 - 51:17)
second loss the tournament was like (51:16 - 51:18)
thank you for playing (51:17 - 51:23)
you're out like it was so smooth (51:18 - 51:26)
to and i've been to countless will and (51:23 - 51:27)
myself have been to (51:26 - 51:30)
countless pokemon tournaments where we (51:27 - 51:33)
are waiting forever for round one (51:30 - 51:34)
because they always (51:33 - 51:37)
they always started late we got hold on (51:34 - 51:39)
hold on we've messed up the pairings (51:37 - 51:42)
we've got to repair everybody (51:39 - 51:44)
you're awkwardly sitting across your (51:42 - 51:46)
form of your opponent for way too long (51:44 - 51:49)
you've run through your chitchat you (51:46 - 51:52)
you get pair you finally get to battle (51:49 - 51:53)
that person (51:52 - 51:57)
and then it feels like an it feels like (51:53 - 51:59)
if you if it was a short battle like (51:57 - 52:01)
maybe you you just got lucky you had the (51:59 - 52:03)
you had good rng you you had the correct (52:01 - 52:04)
deck (52:03 - 52:07)
you beat them pretty quickly in swiss it (52:04 - 52:09)
sometimes would seem like (52:07 - 52:11)
you're now waiting over an hour for next (52:09 - 52:12)
pairing (52:11 - 52:14)
or if you're one of these people that (52:12 - 52:17)
were playing like the pokey dads (52:14 - 52:20)
which took eight years to play one card (52:17 - 52:23)
and you were the one of like the 30 (52:20 - 52:25)
people that went to the 45 minute time (52:23 - 52:26)
limit (52:25 - 52:27)
and then as soon as you finish that (52:26 - 52:29)
match it's like what pairings are up for (52:27 - 52:30)
next round and you're like ah (52:29 - 52:32)
geez i gotta pee and get something to (52:30 - 52:34)
drink but i gotta sit back down against (52:32 - 52:36)
somebody else right away (52:34 - 52:38)
uh it was one of the smoothest official (52:36 - 52:39)
pokemon tournaments that i've (52:38 - 52:43)
ever competed in what i'm saying (52:39 - 52:45)
is i don't know what the tcg people are (52:43 - 52:47)
doing they're out of their minds (52:45 - 52:50)
to be hosting and continuing to use this (52:47 - 52:52)
broken game like they just need to fix (52:50 - 52:54)
their game (52:52 - 52:57)
like i want to play the tcg i miss the (52:54 - 52:58)
tcg (52:57 - 53:01)
i have a lot of cards invested in tcgo i (52:58 - 53:03)
have a lot of cards irl i'm (53:01 - 53:06)
sitting through next to 17 stacks of (53:03 - 53:07)
cards right now (53:06 - 53:10)
same but i pokemon cards though (53:07 - 53:14)
can't even imagine participating in (53:10 - 53:17)
a tcg pokemon tournament knowing that (53:14 - 53:18)
their app is (53:17 - 53:20)
incredibly broken also thank you to (53:18 - 53:21)
everyone who (53:20 - 53:23)
wished me luck this past weekend i'm (53:21 - 53:25)
super sorry i lost (53:23 - 53:28)
i tried hard to win i won one better (53:25 - 53:30)
next time i won one (53:28 - 53:33)
you i mean you only really started what (53:30 - 53:35)
like heavy duty (53:33 - 53:38)
this year i think that's impressive (53:35 - 53:39)
growth i think you should be proud of (53:38 - 53:40)
what you accomplished (53:39 - 53:42)
i agree you'll do much better next time (53:40 - 53:43)
like (53:42 - 53:45)
for years you said how much you didn't (53:43 - 53:47)
like competitive and you've jumped in (53:45 - 53:49)
and you have improved incredibly you got (53:47 - 53:51)
to the players cup which is (53:49 - 53:54)
fantastic that's all amazing things and (53:51 - 53:56)
if you keep with it i'm sure you'll do (53:54 - 53:57)
great (53:56 - 53:59)
don't beat yourself up let me beat you (53:57 - 54:00)
up yeah we'll (53:59 - 54:02)
we'll take it to text and rip you a new (54:00 - 54:04)
one okay perfect (54:02 - 54:07)
yeah yeah there was um countless times (54:04 - 54:08)
on the show where i did not like vgc (54:07 - 54:10)
competitive but (54:08 - 54:13)
i think now that i understand it better (54:10 - 54:14)
i like it (54:13 - 54:20)
but it is uh very time consuming as well (54:14 - 54:20)
which is like the main reason i got out (54:21 - 54:25)
of the tcg competitive because (54:23 - 54:27)
not only was it incredibly time (54:25 - 54:30)
consuming it was uh incredibly expensive (54:27 - 54:33)
this is true of all trading card games (54:30 - 54:35)
my zip code finder is working i got (54:33 - 54:37)
three locations i got game universe (54:35 - 54:41)

then either correct uh (56:28 - 56:34)
yeah they don't have magic uh (56:30 - 56:35)
i was not trying to say that you could (56:34 - 56:37)
play magic there (56:35 - 56:40)
don't go there to play magic yes (56:37 - 56:43)
you can set up your own stuff there but (56:40 - 56:45)
for things that are officially run (56:43 - 56:47)

key forge stuff it's like they're they (56:52 - 56:56)

piggybacking off the tcg stuff we just (57:17 - 57:20)
talked about (57:19 - 57:23)
uh vivid voltage will be coming out (57:20 - 57:25)
officially on november 13th (57:23 - 57:27)
although seems like everyone in the (57:25 - 57:29)
world already has vivid voltage at this (57:27 - 57:31)
point (57:29 - 57:34)
vivid voltage will feature just the tiny (57:31 - 57:37)
amount of you know over 185 different (57:34 - 57:38)
cards (57:37 - 57:42)
this will have the chonky pikachu (57:38 - 57:46)
the big chunker pikachu v-max (57:42 - 57:47)
uh it looks like there will be a (57:46 - 57:50)
hitmontop card b will be a card here as (57:47 - 57:51)
a supporter (57:50 - 57:55)
uh the gay raico card is coming out yeah (57:51 - 57:58)
um ninjas should ninja are in the set as (57:55 - 57:59)
well (57:58 - 58:01)
so it should be it should be a pretty (57:59 - 58:02)
good set (58:01 - 58:06)
there's like this this new fad (58:02 - 58:07)
do you guys remember you guys of course (58:06 - 58:09)
you guys remember you're much older than (58:07 - 58:10)
i am (58:09 - 58:12)
yeah but that means our memories are (58:10 - 58:13)
starting to fail yeah oh okay (58:12 - 58:15)
it depends remember what it was from (58:13 - 58:17)
your childhood and we were adults (58:15 - 58:20)
no okay from my childhood when you guys (58:17 - 58:21)
were adults (58:20 - 58:23)
when pokemon came out and everyone was (58:21 - 58:25)
like this is a fad (58:23 - 58:28)
oh yeah yeah oh yeah it was a total (58:25 - 58:30)
there were so many articles about the (58:28 - 58:33)
the new fad how long would this fad last (58:30 - 58:34)
yeah that was (58:33 - 58:37)
everywhere and and there's a tv (58:34 - 58:40)
guide and (58:37 - 58:43)
obviously we know that pokemon isn't a (58:40 - 58:43)
fad (58:43 - 58:45)
you know it's lasted all this all this (58:43 - 58:46)
time you know there was maybe a point (58:45 - 58:48)
where it was at its lowest of low you (58:46 - 58:48)
know (58:48 - 58:50)
after gen 2 before gen 3 that kind of (58:48 - 58:52)
stuff but there's like this (58:50 - 58:56)
new actual pokemon fad that's existing (58:52 - 58:59)
where it was a couple big youtubers (58:56 - 59:02)
they suddenly decided to (58:59 - 59:07)
like buy old booster boxes of pokemon (59:02 - 59:07)
cards (59:07 - 59:10)
oh i've seen this yes i've seen (59:07 - 59:11)
screenshots of people like (59:10 - 59:15)
i have uh blah blah blah blah booster (59:11 - 59:17)
box and it cost me blah money and (59:15 - 59:20)
yeah so what i'll i'll explain it for (59:17 - 59:21)
people out of the loop (59:20 - 59:24)
take a take a big youtuber pkmncast (59:21 - 59:26)
nope i said big youtubers okay so (59:24 - 59:28)
anyways just take a big youtuber (59:26 - 59:30)
you know they these youtubers are (59:28 - 59:32)
millionaires at this point right (59:30 - 59:34)
i'm talking about like not pew well (59:32 - 59:35)
pewdiepie is number one but you know (59:34 - 59:38)
up there with pewdiepie they buy like a (59:35 - 59:40)
a 50 000 (59:38 - 59:42)
box of pokemon cards you know something (59:40 - 59:44)
old first edition (59:42 - 59:47)
you know very rare and what they do (59:44 - 59:50)
is they they like 50 000 to them is a (59:47 - 59:51)
drop in the bucket right they probably (59:50 - 59:52)
make 50 000 (59:51 - 59:54)
on a single youtube video with ad (59:52 - 59:56)
revenue they they buy this 50 (59:54 - 59:59)
000 box and then they ask their (59:56 - 60:01)
their youtube friends where they ask (59:59 - 60:03)
other people if they want to buy (60:01 - 60:07)
into the box because a booster pack (60:03 - 60:08)
of these cards might be around a (60:07 - 60:11)
thousand dollars or so (60:08 - 60:14)
1500 or so so then their their friends (60:11 - 60:15)
you know youtube (60:14 - 60:18)
friends celebrities fans that just (60:15 - 60:19)
apparently have a thousand dollars (60:18 - 60:20)
sitting around (60:19 - 60:23)
will buy into the box (60:20 - 60:26)
and so now they they buy a 50 000 (60:23 - 60:29)
box which for an average person (60:26 - 60:31)
listening to this show (60:29 - 60:33)
probably just doesn't have fifty (60:31 - 60:35)
thousand dollars to buy pokemon cards (60:33 - 60:36)
with maybe there's like (60:35 - 60:38)
two or three listeners if you are one of (60:36 - 60:41)
those two and three listeners (60:38 - 60:43)
patreon.com (60:41 - 60:46)
uh please support the show but uh like (60:43 - 60:47)
an average person doesn't have 50 (60:46 - 60:51)
000 to spend on pokemon cards (60:47 - 60:54)
heck i would say most don't even have a (60:51 - 60:56)
thousand dollars to buy one single (60:54 - 60:58)
booster pack (60:56 - 60:59)
but they call i think they're called (60:58 - 61:02)
breaks so a big youtuber buys a fifty (60:59 - 61:04)
thousand dollar box they say hey (61:02 - 61:07)
you can buy into my box for a thousand (61:04 - 61:08)
dollars fifteen hundred dollars (61:07 - 61:13)
and then people do and so in reality (61:08 - 61:16)
the youtuber isn't really spending any (61:13 - 61:17)
money they're spending the money up (61:16 - 61:18)
front but they're getting a lot of their (61:17 - 61:19)
money back (61:18 - 61:20)
because people are buying in and then (61:19 - 61:22)
they post the video and then (61:20 - 61:24)
you know people watch it and then they (61:22 - 61:26)
get the ad revenue so this is the fad (61:24 - 61:29)
and what this has okay but why why are (61:26 - 61:31)
people buying into this box this is the (61:29 - 61:32)
disconnect for me (61:31 - 61:34)
yeah you're not gonna get a thousand (61:32 - 61:36)
dollars worth of cards out of it (61:34 - 61:39)
you could are they but but (61:36 - 61:41)
are they being sent the thousand dollars (61:39 - 61:44)
of cards like yeah youtube (61:41 - 61:48)
you bought the pack so if you (61:44 - 61:50)
let's say it was like i'm just trying to (61:48 - 61:52)
think let's say you were doing like (61:50 - 61:54)
uh gosh i'm trying to think of like what (61:52 - 61:56)
what cards i know off the top of my head (61:54 - 61:57)
somebody's gonna write and be like you (61:56 - 61:59)
were wrong about the price for just (61:57 - 62:01)
because i can't i'm not gonna pull up (61:59 - 62:03)
card prices let's just say we were doing (62:01 - 62:04)
like fossil set (62:03 - 62:06)
and let's say a fossil booster pack is (62:04 - 62:08)
300 i don't (62:06 - 62:10)
think it is but just for the just humor (62:08 - 62:12)
me for the sake of this conversation (62:10 - 62:12)
let's say (62:12 - 62:16)
you spent 10 000 on a fossil booster box (62:12 - 62:18)
you're telling people that it's 300 to (62:16 - 62:19)
buy in and (62:18 - 62:22)
if you pulled uh let's just say hollow (62:19 - 62:23)
aerodactyl from fossil (62:22 - 62:26)
that the aerodactyl would be worth 500 (62:23 - 62:28)
so (62:26 - 62:31)
you say i want to buy a booster booster (62:28 - 62:33)
pack in your box it's 300 (62:31 - 62:36)
they will then most of these are are (62:33 - 62:38)
streamed either on twitch or youtube (62:36 - 62:38)
they then (62:38 - 62:40)
open the pack and they'll say this is (62:38 - 62:42)
greg's pack thank you greg for (62:40 - 62:44)
supporting the break box we're gonna (62:42 - 62:45)
open it up (62:44 - 62:47)
we're gonna carefully move one card here (62:45 - 62:48)
we're gonna go through (62:47 - 62:50)
all of your cards because this is your (62:48 - 62:52)
pack reg we're gonna go through it (62:50 - 62:56)
and at the end oh you got a omastar raw (62:52 - 62:57)
gosh you know this is a (62:56 - 63:00)
great omastar you know only worth about (62:57 - 63:01)
45 cents (63:00 - 63:03)
but you know you're gonna love it when (63:01 - 63:05)
we when we send it your way so this is (63:03 - 63:06)
what happens (63:05 - 63:10)
um it's like this we it like this (63:06 - 63:12)
this is an actual thing that is existing (63:10 - 63:14)
i am now seeing (63:12 - 63:17)
smaller content creators buying boxes (63:14 - 63:20)
having people buy in this is truly a fad (63:17 - 63:24)
and i just don't i guess it's like two (63:20 - 63:25)
things right like (63:24 - 63:28)
you're being featured on their content (63:25 - 63:29)
you know if you're if your favorite (63:28 - 63:31)
youtuber is i don't know (63:29 - 63:34)
uh will smith i don't will smith's not a (63:31 - 63:36)
youtuber but will smith decides to buy (63:34 - 63:39)
a box of uh something and then you buy (63:36 - 63:40)
in (63:39 - 63:42)
and then the thought process is they (63:40 - 63:43)
open it they say it's your (63:42 - 63:46)
your pack you know you do the thing and (63:43 - 63:46)
then they (63:46 - 63:48)
they send you the pack afterwards and (63:46 - 63:50)
you know if you're lucky and you maybe (63:48 - 63:51)
you got the aerodactyl (63:50 - 63:54)
you spent 300 on the booster pack but (63:51 - 63:55)
now you have a 500 (63:54 - 63:57)
aerodactyl that you could apparently i (63:55 - 64:00)
mean sell this is the other weird part (63:57 - 64:03)
is while the aerodactyl (64:00 - 64:05)
is 500 again i don't know how much (64:03 - 64:07)
aerodactyl is this is just hypothetical (64:05 - 64:09)
you bought you bought a booster pack for (64:07 - 64:10)
300 bucks (64:09 - 64:13)
let's say you pulled the 500 aerodactyl (64:10 - 64:15)
that's assuming (64:13 - 64:18)
you have somebody that wants to buy the (64:15 - 64:19)
aerodactyl you know what i mean (64:18 - 64:23)
just because i was just not gambling (64:19 - 64:26)
it is gambling it's 100 gambling how is (64:23 - 64:28)
this not falling under (64:26 - 64:31)
like the weird pyramid scheme stuff like (64:28 - 64:32)
how are they just going to (64:31 - 64:34)
set it it does feel like a pyramid (64:32 - 64:36)
scheme i mean it's buy (64:34 - 64:39)
into my thing and you may get rewards at (64:36 - 64:40)
least (64:39 - 64:42)
somebody might see it if you're opening (64:40 - 64:43)
up on packs but you're (64:42 - 64:45)
you're spending way more money than (64:43 - 64:46)
you're getting in (64:45 - 64:49)
like way more thing about it too is if (64:46 - 64:51)
you just wanted to buy one of these (64:49 - 64:52)
booster packs (64:51 - 64:55)
you can just buy that booster pack there (64:52 - 64:55)
are (64:55 - 64:57)
especially with the older packs that are (64:55 - 64:59)
weighted um because we we know that (64:57 - 65:02)
newer booster packs are designed to all (64:59 - 65:03)
weigh the same (65:02 - 65:05)
so you can't tell what's in it but older (65:03 - 65:07)
booster packs were never like that (65:05 - 65:10)
so older booster packs heavier packs are (65:07 - 65:12)
more likely to have (65:10 - 65:14)
good stuff if you wanted to buy like i (65:12 - 65:16)
don't know first edition team rocket (65:14 - 65:19)
you could buy into somebody's brake but (65:16 - 65:20)
they're going to charge you (65:19 - 65:23)
an up charge one because they want to (65:20 - 65:25)
make money off of you (65:23 - 65:27)
so let's just say a team rocket booster (65:25 - 65:29)
pack is i actually think a team rocket (65:27 - 65:31)
first edition booster pack is like 800 (65:29 - 65:32)
to a thousand dollars (65:31 - 65:35)
depending on the weight normally if a (65:32 - 65:37)
pack weighs more (65:35 - 65:38)
it'll be more money because you're more (65:37 - 65:40)
likely to get something good (65:38 - 65:41)
and the packs that don't weigh as much (65:40 - 65:43)
will be cheaper (65:41 - 65:46)
but somebody might be like buy into my (65:43 - 65:47)
team rocket (65:46 - 65:50)
booster box it's 300 bucks so it's like (65:47 - 65:52)
you're spending 300 more dollars to buy (65:50 - 65:54)
into somebody else's box (65:52 - 65:56)
when you could just go to ebay and buy (65:54 - 65:58)
your own pack (65:56 - 66:01)
save 300 and then you get your own (65:58 - 66:04)
enjoyment of opening the pack yourself (66:01 - 66:05)
yeah but a famous (66:04 - 66:08)
person touched my pack and touched my (66:05 - 66:09)
cards (66:08 - 66:12)
that's what's important i mean are they (66:09 - 66:13)
at least signing a card in there (66:12 - 66:17)
for you i mean i guess they could (66:13 - 66:19)
this is what if they're going to sign (66:17 - 66:20)
your (66:19 - 66:23)
you know 500 aerodactyl your (66:20 - 66:24)
aerodactyl's not worth 500. (66:23 - 66:27)
this whole youtube cult of personality (66:24 - 66:28)
thing is not (66:27 - 66:30)
completely bizarre and against (66:28 - 66:32)
everything that we were raised to (66:30 - 66:32)
believe (66:32 - 66:34)
i don't know where you've been well i (66:32 - 66:37)
think i think for the youtuber it is (66:34 - 66:39)
it is good content i think like if (66:37 - 66:40)
you're a fan of that (66:39 - 66:43)
youtuber if you're a fan of i don't know (66:40 - 66:44)
pewdiepie (66:43 - 66:46)
uh i'm not but if you are a fan of (66:44 - 66:48)
pewdiepie and they open up pokemon cards (66:46 - 66:50)
you might as a viewer go like (66:48 - 66:51)
wow this was really fun i haven't (66:50 - 66:53)
thought about pokemon cards in a while (66:51 - 66:55)
i want to go get myself a charizard like (66:53 - 66:58)
that is that is a common (66:55 - 67:01)
like path of like your favorite creator (66:58 - 67:03)
introducing you in something you might (67:01 - 67:04)
have (67:03 - 67:06)
had nostalgia for uh but what has (67:04 - 67:08)
happened what has happened (67:06 - 67:09)
in the last couple weeks since this (67:08 - 67:11)
break thing has started (67:09 - 67:13)
is other creators have been jumping on (67:11 - 67:15)
the bandwagon of like i have no interest (67:13 - 67:16)
in pokemon cards (67:15 - 67:18)
i've seen so and so do this it's gotten (67:16 - 67:20)
them a ton of views (67:18 - 67:22)
i'm sure the ad revenue is good so i'm (67:20 - 67:23)
gonna jump in on it (67:22 - 67:27)
and it's driving the market of cards (67:23 - 67:30)
up because now there's this demand of (67:27 - 67:33)
i'm looking for older cards to buy (67:30 - 67:34)
because the (67:33 - 67:37)
rarer the older it is the (67:34 - 67:39)
the harder it is to get the more money i (67:37 - 67:41)
will spend because (67:39 - 67:44)
you know no one wants to see no one (67:41 - 67:46)
wants to buy into a darkness ablaze (67:44 - 67:47)
break (67:46 - 67:51)
because i can go on cool stuff inc and i (67:47 - 67:53)
can get darkness ablaze for 99 bucks (67:51 - 67:54)
because it just came out three months (67:53 - 67:55)
ago (67:54 - 67:57)
but what it has done is it's made older (67:55 - 67:58)
cards (67:57 - 68:01)
harder to find it has drive those older (67:58 - 68:01)
cards (68:01 - 68:05)
slightly up in price and it has taken (68:01 - 68:07)
current cards like vivid voltage which (68:05 - 68:08)
comes out in a couple days (68:07 - 68:11)
and now people are buying that up (68:08 - 68:12)
because that is the newest set and (68:11 - 68:14)
people just want to get something that (68:12 - 68:15)
is new and that is pokemon (68:14 - 68:18)
so it's kind of been a bit harder not (68:15 - 68:19)
impossible (68:18 - 68:22)
but it's been a bit harder to find vivid (68:19 - 68:23)
voltage (68:22 - 68:26)
um and champions path uh which came out (68:23 - 68:29)
recently because so many people who are (68:26 - 68:29)
not (68:29 - 68:32)
pokemon fans have just started getting (68:29 - 68:33)
pokemon cards (68:32 - 68:35)
and i don't want this to sound like i'm (68:33 - 68:38)
gatekeeping anyway it's very cool that (68:35 - 68:39)
like people have this interest in (68:38 - 68:41)
pokemon cards but i do (68:39 - 68:44)
believe it is is a fad for them where (68:41 - 68:47)
they will buy it they will they will do (68:44 - 68:48)
their content (68:47 - 68:51)
then they will maybe pull like a 50 000 (68:48 - 68:53)
uh i don't know (68:51 - 68:55)
lugia or something first edition lugia (68:53 - 68:57)
it'll be a moment (68:55 - 68:59)
put lugia aside or maybe sell it and (68:57 - 69:01)
then kind of forget about it like (68:59 - 69:04)
and then these cards will eventually (69:01 - 69:05)
drop again (69:04 - 69:07)
in price when people have moved on to (69:05 - 69:09)
whatever the next youtube fad is (69:07 - 69:12)
this feels very strange i agreed i don't (69:09 - 69:13)
get (69:12 - 69:18)
why you would pay upwards of 300 (69:13 - 69:21)
for somebody else's content (69:18 - 69:24)
on the off chance that you could use it (69:21 - 69:26)
as your content though right like if (69:24 - 69:28)
you're a content creator (69:26 - 69:31)
like let's say i i wanted to buy into (69:28 - 69:32)
somebody's break (69:31 - 69:34)
let's say real breaking nate was doing a (69:32 - 69:35)
break i don't think he is (69:34 - 69:37)
i love real breaking nate one of my (69:35 - 69:38)
favorite tcg content creators (69:37 - 69:41)
well let's say he decides to get on this (69:38 - 69:42)
bandwagon (69:41 - 69:44)
he buys a box of i don't know first (69:42 - 69:45)
edition (69:44 - 69:47)
team rocket and he says you know it's a (69:45 - 69:49)
thousand dollars (69:47 - 69:52)
if you want to join in on my break which (69:49 - 69:53)
i think (69:52 - 69:55)
again i think team rocket packs are like (69:53 - 69:57)
eight hundred to a thousand dollars (69:55 - 70:00)
and i go sure yeah i love one pack yeah (69:57 - 70:02)
well yeah it's team rocket i don't know (70:00 - 70:03)
what you want (70:02 - 70:04)
i got a bunch of first edition team (70:03 - 70:06)
rockets sitting in a trapper keeper in (70:04 - 70:08)
my basement right now because i was a (70:06 - 70:09)
liar (70:08 - 70:10)
like my dad bought those when it came (70:09 - 70:12)
out is it bad as tulips (70:10 - 70:16)
in brussels and whatever the 1800s (70:12 - 70:19)
so if i if i bought into again this is (70:16 - 70:20)
just hypothetical (70:19 - 70:22)
if nate decides to do team rocket (70:20 - 70:24)
whatever thousand dollars i want to buy (70:22 - 70:26)
in because then that puts me on (70:24 - 70:29)
his youtube video but also i i would (70:26 - 70:31)
assume because i've seen this with other (70:29 - 70:33)
content creators that (70:31 - 70:37)
when he opens my pack (70:33 - 70:40)
that that however long it takes at five (70:37 - 70:41)
six minutes (70:40 - 70:44)
i that is my content as well because i (70:41 - 70:47)
paid for that moment so he gets are you (70:44 - 70:49)
in there with them like do you get to (70:47 - 70:50)
jump into their stream and be like i've (70:49 - 70:51)
seen let's (70:50 - 70:53)
talk together yeah i've seen somewhere (70:51 - 70:54)
where the (70:53 - 70:56)
the person will like discord call the (70:54 - 70:58)
other person so they'll be on call (70:56 - 71:00)
together either as they're opening it or (70:58 - 71:02)
sometimes even video call (71:00 - 71:04)
um or sometimes they're like oh so and (71:02 - 71:05)
so can't be here you know (71:04 - 71:08)
this is uh this is steve he's uh he does (71:05 - 71:10)
a pokemon podcast every week he bought (71:08 - 71:11)
into a break thanks for the a thousand (71:10 - 71:13)
dollars i really hope you got good luck (71:11 - 71:14)
in this pack and then they open the pack (71:13 - 71:15)
and it's like (71:14 - 71:19)
i don't know like giovanni's nidoran (71:15 - 71:22)
um which is like worth like 50 cents (71:19 - 71:25)
but if you're a youtuber and you're (71:22 - 71:27)
thinking oh if i spend a thousand (71:25 - 71:29)
dollars on somebody else's content not (71:27 - 71:31)
only do i get featured on their content (71:29 - 71:34)
but now i have like five to six minutes (71:31 - 71:36)
that i can put on my youtube channel (71:34 - 71:38)
and hopefully i can make the a thousand (71:36 - 71:40)
dollars back in ad revenue (71:38 - 71:42)
i i think your weight overthinking it i (71:40 - 71:44)
i think this is literally the equivalent (71:42 - 71:45)
of (71:44 - 71:46)
boy it's really hard this is a pyramid (71:45 - 71:48)
scheme well no no but (71:46 - 71:51)
it's great but but also it's like you (71:48 - 71:51)
know (71:51 - 71:54)
we're we're saying the value we're (71:51 - 71:57)
devaluing it because it's youtube people (71:54 - 71:57)
and we're all (71:57 - 72:00)
older and out of the youtube lifestyle (71:57 - 72:01)
but if i were to say like (72:00 - 72:04)
taylor swift is opening a box of pokemon (72:01 - 72:05)
cards and you can buy in (72:04 - 72:07)
and you're gonna get mailed a set of (72:05 - 72:10)
pokemon cards from taylor's there are (72:07 - 72:14)
rabid taylor swift stands (72:10 - 72:16)
who just want pokemon cards that taylor (72:14 - 72:17)
swift (72:16 - 72:20)
touched and that same rabidity exists (72:17 - 72:23)
for youtubers no that's what i said with (72:20 - 72:25)
the pewdiepie right like if pewdiepie (72:23 - 72:26)
decides to open (72:25 - 72:29)
a box of cards and you are a pewdiepie (72:26 - 72:31)
fan but not a pokemon fan and there's (72:29 - 72:32)
and he's saying you know it's a thousand (72:31 - 72:34)
dollars and you get one of these packs (72:32 - 72:36)
i i don't doubt that there's probably (72:34 - 72:38)
thousands of people that would do that (72:36 - 72:40)
deal because they like that dude so much (72:38 - 72:41)
like that that doesn't surprise but (72:40 - 72:43)
that's that's i mean (72:41 - 72:45)
that's the basis that that is the (72:43 - 72:48)
foundation for where this is coming from (72:45 - 72:50)
it makes no sense because we're not (72:48 - 72:52)
we're not stands we're not (72:50 - 72:55)
it's just not i just can't wait there is (72:52 - 72:56)
no (72:55 - 73:00)
spending i i am a super fan of star wars (72:56 - 73:04)
i would not pay a thousand dollars (73:00 - 73:06)
to get a pack of cards mark hamill (73:04 - 73:07)
touched (73:06 - 73:08)
[Laughter] (73:07 - 73:11)
there is no way agreed agreed a thousand (73:08 - 73:13)
i'm gonna look at and say yes (73:11 - 73:15)
i have no way of verifying that this (73:13 - 73:17)
person actually touched this set of (73:15 - 73:20)
cards i'm paying a thousand dollars (73:17 - 73:23)
to a random person to be mentioned by by (73:20 - 73:26)
mark hamill on the stream for five (73:23 - 73:28)
minutes while they did something else (73:26 - 73:30)
and i'm gonna pay a thousand dollars for (73:28 - 73:32)
that (73:30 - 73:34)
for mystery cards like well you could (73:32 - 73:35)
get a (73:34 - 73:37)
five thousand dollar card out of a (73:35 - 73:38)
thousand dollar pack i mean that is (73:37 - 73:41)
part of the appeal as well so you're (73:38 - 73:42)
basically paying (73:41 - 73:46)
mark hamill to go to las vegas and pull (73:42 - 73:46)
the (73:46 - 73:50)
right the slot machine for you (73:46 - 73:54)
and film it this is your pull well (73:50 - 73:54)
this is like the untalked about well (73:54 - 73:58)
it's not even untalked about but the (73:56 - 73:59)
thing about buying (73:58 - 74:02)
so when a person buys a booster box (73:59 - 74:04)
of cards which is normally a thousand (74:02 - 74:06)
dollars or sorry a hundred dollars (74:04 - 74:10)
geez so would you go (74:06 - 74:12)
if you're a fan of pokemon cards or just (74:10 - 74:13)
pokemon (74:12 - 74:14)
maybe you want to get into pokemon cards (74:13 - 74:16)
and every three months in the united (74:14 - 74:18)
states (74:16 - 74:19)
pretty much every three months around (74:18 - 74:21)
the world not japan (74:19 - 74:23)
you want to collect the newest set of (74:21 - 74:24)
pokemon cards (74:23 - 74:27)
you're spending a hundred dollars nobody (74:24 - 74:27)
wants (74:27 - 74:30)
very few people want to collect the set (74:27 - 74:31)
of pokemon they want (74:30 - 74:34)
the cards that they want the pokemon (74:31 - 74:37)
collectors it's very few and far between (74:34 - 74:38)
there are plenty of people that want to (74:37 - 74:40)
complete the set it's just hard to (74:38 - 74:43)
complete the set if you have no friends (74:40 - 74:44)
that's also expensive to complete the (74:43 - 74:46)
set i mean that's a life lesson it's (74:44 - 74:48)
hard to complete a lot of things if you (74:46 - 74:49)
don't have any friends so every three (74:48 - 74:49)
months (74:49 - 74:51)
you're spending a hundred dollars you're (74:49 - 74:54)
getting 32 booster packs (74:51 - 74:57)
and normally it's (74:54 - 75:00)
i wouldn't say that it's rare like (74:57 - 75:03)
most booster boxes for 100 bucks you (75:00 - 75:05)
open those 32 packs (75:03 - 75:08)
and you walk away feeling from what i (75:05 - 75:09)
pulled (75:08 - 75:10)
if i was to sell this right now on the (75:09 - 75:12)
market i will get my hundred dollars (75:10 - 75:13)
back (75:12 - 75:15)
because there are there are just cards (75:13 - 75:16)
that are worth (75:15 - 75:19)
you know if if you get out of (75:16 - 75:23)
320 cards right 10 cards per pack (75:19 - 75:27)
18 32 packs yeah 320 cards (75:23 - 75:30)
you probably have at least 10 (75:27 - 75:31)
of those 320 cards are probably worth (75:30 - 75:34)
around 10 some might be worth five (75:31 - 75:36)
some might be worth 20 maybe one is (75:34 - 75:37)
worth 50. but (75:36 - 75:40)
after you open 32 packs of cards you're (75:37 - 75:41)
probably going to have (75:40 - 75:43)
over a hundred dollars in things you can (75:41 - 75:45)
sell back (75:43 - 75:47)
and that is you buying an entire pack (75:45 - 75:48)
and again (75:47 - 75:50)
but there's the situation where you go (75:48 - 75:52)
to target you spend four dollars on a (75:50 - 75:53)
pack of cards (75:52 - 75:55)
you open it everything in that pack is (75:53 - 75:57)
worth less than the four dollars (75:55 - 76:00)
and you feel kind of slighted you go ah (75:57 - 76:01)
this was a bad pack (76:00 - 76:02)
ugh i see a green card it's not a white (76:01 - 76:05)
card it's gonna be bad but it's pretty (76:02 - 76:08)
safe buying a box of cards (76:05 - 76:12)
if you and not feeling super slighted (76:08 - 76:14)
because the majority of the blocks will (76:12 - 76:15)
get you your money back (76:14 - 76:19)
if you decide to sell i cannot imagine (76:15 - 76:21)
because that's not talked about in these (76:19 - 76:22)
breaks (76:21 - 76:24)
you know you you get an old booster box (76:22 - 76:25)
fifty thousand dollars (76:24 - 76:27)
there's the reason it's fifty thousand (76:25 - 76:28)
dollars is because there's probably a (76:27 - 76:30)
couple cards that are worth ten thousand (76:28 - 76:32)
dollars or twenty five thousand dollars (76:30 - 76:32)
or (76:32 - 76:34)
fifty thousand dollars because that's (76:32 - 76:35)
why the box costs so much because (76:34 - 76:37)
there's a couple cards (76:35 - 76:39)
in that set that are worth something (76:37 - 76:40)
because they're hard to find they're (76:39 - 76:41)
rare they're limited (76:40 - 76:44)
it's been so long some of these cards (76:41 - 76:45)
are lost or damaged to time (76:44 - 76:49)
so there's a reason why a 50 50 000 box (76:45 - 76:50)
is a 50 000 (76:49 - 76:52)
box but i can't imagine being that (76:50 - 76:53)
person (76:52 - 76:56)
on the hype cycle totally i love the (76:53 - 76:58)
content creator i love that this is (76:56 - 76:58)
thing this is (76:58 - 77:00)
like i love watching this i love the (76:58 - 77:01)
content creator i have a chance to (77:00 - 77:02)
support them i can (77:01 - 77:04)
buy in here's a thousand dollars and (77:02 - 77:06)
then their pack (77:04 - 77:08)
is like the pack that is like i'm sorry (77:06 - 77:10)
that your your pack's only worth like (77:08 - 77:11)
five bucks (77:10 - 77:12)
like you don't hear about that (77:11 - 77:14)
afterwards you hear about the moments of (77:12 - 77:16)
like wow so-and-so pulled the like (77:14 - 77:18)
the seventy thousand dollar card unreal (77:16 - 77:21)
like whoa what an amazing box but like (77:18 - 77:22)
how many people (77:21 - 77:24)
walked away with like the the like the (77:22 - 77:26)
45 cent card (77:24 - 77:29)
but they're the ones that there's 36 (77:26 - 77:30)
packs in a box it'd be (77:29 - 77:34)
35 other people no i would well probably (77:30 - 77:34)
like (77:34 - 77:37)
25 other people because in in like a in (77:34 - 77:40)
a normal box (77:37 - 77:42)
in an average booster box you're (77:40 - 77:43)
probably getting like (77:42 - 77:45)
four to five decent pulls i mean i've (77:43 - 77:47)
had i've had (77:45 - 77:51)
i have probably bought 30 boxes (77:47 - 77:55)
in the last 12 years and i felt like out (77:51 - 77:56)
of those 30 boxes (77:55 - 78:00)
one box was absolutely awful (77:56 - 78:01)
and i felt a few of those boxes were (78:00 - 78:03)
like above (78:01 - 78:06)
average like i was like wow this box is (78:03 - 78:07)
nothing but (78:06 - 78:11)
bangers just pulling banger after banger (78:07 - 78:12)
in this box but that's (78:11 - 78:15)
but like there is an average uh of like (78:12 - 78:18)
okay i expect you know (78:15 - 78:20)
five or six good cards out of the 32 (78:18 - 78:21)
booster packs (78:20 - 78:23)
is it 32 or is it 36 i can't even (78:21 - 78:25)
remember remember it's one (78:23 - 78:27)
anyways i don't know i just think i just (78:25 - 78:28)
think it's it's (78:27 - 78:30)
i wanted to bring it up because vivid (78:28 - 78:33)
voltage is coming out soon (78:30 - 78:36)
and i feel like the (78:33 - 78:40)
tcg market is in this weird flux right (78:36 - 78:40)
now (78:40 - 78:44)
because of this um because of this fad (78:40 - 78:48)
that is kind of going around on on (78:44 - 78:51)
youtube and twitch i don't (78:48 - 78:53)
think like the fad was like i don't (78:51 - 78:56)
think the fad started to be like (78:53 - 78:58)
hurting anyone it just people are (78:56 - 79:00)
piggybacking off of it because that's (78:58 - 79:01)
what's hot right now but i don't think (79:00 - 79:03)
it'll be hot forever (79:01 - 79:07)
speaking of something hot forever (79:03 - 79:09)
pokemon (79:07 - 79:11)
that was the worst uh there's the two (79:09 - 79:13)
community days later this month i think (79:11 - 79:14)
we talked about that last week (79:13 - 79:17)
yep on a couple days ago here niantic (79:14 - 79:19)
posted that there's new tests coming for (79:17 - 79:20)
select trainers beginning on monday (79:19 - 79:22)
november 9th which will be the day this (79:20 - 79:23)
podcast goes up (79:22 - 79:26)
they are conducting an xp rebalancing (79:23 - 79:28)
for australia and new zealand in which (79:26 - 79:31)
trainers will experience adjusted xp (79:28 - 79:33)
from catching hatching eggs evolving and (79:31 - 79:34)
more (79:33 - 79:36)
this will run for a week trainers might (79:34 - 79:37)
be (79:36 - 79:39)
seeing different items pop up in free (79:37 - 79:41)
daily box (79:39 - 79:44)
and that's it uh they're changing xp (79:41 - 79:47)
i don't maybe they want people to get to (79:44 - 79:51)
40 faster at this point to do (79:47 - 79:53)
nothing um but that's not weird i mean (79:51 - 79:55)
like greg in world of warcraft final (79:53 - 79:56)
fantasy (79:55 - 79:59)
you know over over the years of a game (79:56 - 80:01)
running for so long they usually make it (79:59 - 80:02)
so (80:01 - 80:04)
newer people don't feel like they're (80:02 - 80:05)
stuck at level (80:04 - 80:09)
20 forever but that's to run high-end (80:05 - 80:10)
content (80:09 - 80:13)
what what high-end content are you (80:10 - 80:14)
running in pokemon go (80:13 - 80:18)
um mastercup premier cup the only thing (80:14 - 80:19)
i can think of is battling (80:18 - 80:22)
i mean like if they're doing a month (80:19 - 80:22)
only of (80:22 - 80:25)
master rank battles and you're you like (80:22 - 80:27)
battling and you're only level (80:25 - 80:30)
25 you cannot compete you have to be 38 (80:27 - 80:31)
i guess (80:30 - 80:33)
i mean yeah it seems weird to rush (80:31 - 80:35)
towards (80:33 - 80:39)
to get more people at the end (80:35 - 80:40)
well that's less game when you get to (80:39 - 80:42)
40. (80:40 - 80:45)
what what you have yet to answer what (80:42 - 80:45)
changes (80:45 - 80:47)
nothing nothing change you'll find out (80:45 - 80:48)
when you get yeah when you get to 40 (80:47 - 80:49)
you'll find that i have (80:48 - 80:53)
i have i have consulted many players at (80:49 - 80:53)
40. (80:53 - 80:55)
well we won you get some 40 their games (80:53 - 80:57)
when you get to 40 you have to sign the (80:55 - 80:58)
nda if you can't tell (80:57 - 81:02)
non 40 players what happened (80:58 - 81:02)
and you both well you did not sign this (81:03 - 81:08)
nda (81:07 - 81:10)
no you didn't yeah i did and also my (81:08 - 81:12)
phone uses biometric data so it knows (81:10 - 81:14)
when i'm holding it versus when you're (81:12 - 81:16)
holding it so it doesn't show you the (81:14 - 81:17)
level 40 stuff (81:16 - 81:18)
according the internet we're the same (81:17 - 81:20)
person so give me your phone no (81:18 - 81:22)
yeah the only thing i can think of is (81:20 - 81:23)
the the battling stuff (81:22 - 81:27)
i mean like maybe raids but (81:23 - 81:30)
no yeah it feel i don't know (81:27 - 81:32)
either they're going to like raise the (81:30 - 81:35)
level cap because they want to release (81:32 - 81:37)
like they release things to level higher (81:35 - 81:39)
levels earlier (81:37 - 81:41)
but that sort of defeats the purpose of (81:39 - 81:43)
you get everybody up to the higher level (81:41 - 81:44)
to release them (81:43 - 81:46)
i don't know it's a weird thing i don't (81:44 - 81:47)
get why they're doing it (81:46 - 81:50)
but hey maybe i'll get to 40 this year (81:47 - 81:51)
this will be the year (81:50 - 81:54)
yes okay ranked battles in sword and (81:51 - 81:57)
shield november season has begun (81:54 - 82:01)
this is uh series 7 this is weird (81:57 - 82:04)
series 7 but season (82:01 - 82:08)
12. so seasons are month long (82:04 - 82:10)
that's why it's season 12 because the (82:08 - 82:12)
game's been out for a year now (82:10 - 82:15)
series seven is the rule set (82:12 - 82:18)
i believe series seven the rules (82:15 - 82:21)
will be available until january so if (82:18 - 82:23)
you decide to get into competitive (82:21 - 82:25)
vgc into sword and shield now nothing is (82:23 - 82:27)
going to be changing for november (82:25 - 82:30)
december and i believe all of january (82:27 - 82:31)
the (82:30 - 82:33)
partner pokemon from hohen and alola are (82:31 - 82:34)
allowed (82:33 - 82:36)
so that's like your incineroars your (82:34 - 82:39)
premarinas your uh uh (82:36 - 82:42)
swamperts those are allowed riko entei (82:39 - 82:46)
suicune latius la latias latios uxi (82:42 - 82:49)
mesprit as of heatran reggie giggis (82:46 - 82:52)
cresselia tornado slenderis landorus (82:49 - 82:56)
tapu coco tapu lele tapu bulu tapufini (82:52 - 82:58)
tapufini being the number one pokemon (82:56 - 83:00)
used right now in vgc (82:58 - 83:03)
nail ego buzzwole pheramosa circuitry (83:00 - 83:05)
celestilla cartana guzzler no (83:03 - 83:08)
no don't don't use gus lord it's bad (83:05 - 83:11)
poiple naganadal stockataka and (83:08 - 83:14)
blacephalon are all allowed (83:11 - 83:15)
as well as the two horses we talked (83:14 - 83:18)
about earlier ice horse ghost horse (83:15 - 83:20)
if you do make it to master ball rank (83:18 - 83:22)
you will get three golden bottle caps (83:20 - 83:26)
600 battle points 30 armorite ore (83:22 - 83:29)
30 dinite ore you make it to ultra ball (83:26 - 83:30)
you will get one (83:29 - 83:33)
golden bottle cap 300 bottle bottle cap (83:30 - 83:36)
300 battle points sorry 10 armored or 10 (83:33 - 83:38)
dinite ore (83:36 - 83:40)
and that is for both single and double (83:38 - 83:42)
so i guess if you did both (83:40 - 83:44)
you would walk away with six bottle caps (83:42 - 83:45)
golden bottle caps 1200 (83:44 - 83:48)
uh battle points etc um so that's going (83:45 - 83:49)
on right now (83:48 - 83:52)
they uh it exists i guess (83:49 - 83:55)
pokemon masters uh they moved on i guess (83:52 - 83:55)
we're (83:55 - 83:57)
we have another egg event i felt like we (83:55 - 83:59)
just did the lapras (83:57 - 84:02)
yeah but here's now we have psychics (83:59 - 84:03)
from november (84:02 - 84:05)
4th are you a partner i uh full (84:03 - 84:07)
disclosure i am partnered with dna (84:05 - 84:09)
uh from november 4th to november 18th (84:07 - 84:10)
you will have an increased chance of (84:09 - 84:12)
earning eggs from battles (84:10 - 84:15)
uh those may hatch into (84:12 - 84:17)
like abra grimer execute nidoran if (84:15 - 84:19)
you're lucky trainers you can get a (84:17 - 84:21)
shiny abra or a shiny grimer (84:19 - 84:24)
uh and they released alder and volcarona (84:21 - 84:26)
as the newest sink pair (84:24 - 84:29)
alder and volcarona yeah yeah that makes (84:26 - 84:31)
sense (84:29 - 84:35)
why what when he literally has bravery (84:31 - 84:36)
feathers (84:35 - 84:39)
in his home what that all i would say (84:36 - 84:43)
volcarona is his signature pokemon (84:39 - 84:43)
like he's the champion and volcarona has (84:43 - 84:47)
like (84:46 - 84:50)
pseudo legendary base stats remember (84:47 - 84:51)
when people thought volcarona was (84:50 - 84:52)
legendary (84:51 - 84:55)
i i don't understand why him being the (84:52 - 84:56)
champion and the pseudo legendary have (84:55 - 84:58)
anything to do with each other because (84:56 - 85:00)
that's graviary feathers in his home (84:58 - 85:03)
well he uses a bravery (85:00 - 85:05)
i'm not too i'm not the knight he only (85:03 - 85:06)
uses (85:05 - 85:09)
braviary in black and black to white too (85:06 - 85:13)
does not use that in his uh vulcarona is (85:09 - 85:15)
in all teams that he's in (85:13 - 85:17)
throughout the various games i mean i (85:15 - 85:18)
ain't going to complain about a (85:17 - 85:19)
vulcarona getting more exposure because (85:18 - 85:22)
that is a fantastic pokemon right there (85:19 - 85:25)
do do we know why bulbapedia lists one (85:22 - 85:27)
of his pokemon (85:25 - 85:30)
what his volcarona as deceased uh (85:27 - 85:33)
did he have a vulcarona that died (85:30 - 85:36)
no i don't know am i not remembering i (85:33 - 85:37)
remember his (85:36 - 85:41)
son nephew (85:37 - 85:44)
was his son it was his son right yes (85:41 - 85:47)
what was his dude that dude's name oh (85:44 - 85:51)
like i remember flint jr (85:47 - 85:53)
in the past alder starter pokemon died (85:51 - 85:54)
of illness (85:53 - 85:56)
i think that was brought up in the story (85:54 - 85:58)
yes yeah but was the starter (85:56 - 86:01)
volcarona lucky guy (85:58 - 86:05)
[Laughter] (86:01 - 86:07)
i don't remember this part of the story (86:05 - 86:08)
oh (86:07 - 86:10)
in black and black too white too they do (86:08 - 86:12)
say that his la (86:10 - 86:13)
late partner his late starter partner (86:12 - 86:16)
was vulcan so he started with the (86:13 - 86:16)
larvesta (86:16 - 86:19)
dang well he's the champion got a head (86:16 - 86:20)
start (86:19 - 86:22)
yeah i think uh i think volcarona makes (86:20 - 86:23)
sense i wouldn't be surprised if they're (86:22 - 86:25)
saving bravery for (86:23 - 86:28)
somebody else hugh we already have you (86:25 - 86:30)
we don't have you (86:28 - 86:34)
nate that's the protagonist of (86:30 - 86:37)
black white i don't remember which one (86:34 - 86:37)
no (86:37 - 86:41)
hilbert and hilda are the (86:37 - 86:44)
protagonists of black and white which we (86:41 - 86:44)
already have (86:44 - 86:48)

white two (87:02 - 87:06)
and i have no clue what they would give (87:04 - 87:07)
nate (87:06 - 87:08)

nate (87:31 - 87:34)
in game in the background uh he might (87:31 - 87:35)
have been i think he showed up as a (87:34 - 87:36)
character because (87:35 - 87:39)
like i know nothing about data mines or (87:36 - 87:40)
maybe it's just hilbert (87:39 - 87:43)
and i keep thinking it's nice yeah it (87:40 - 87:43)
has the (87:43 - 87:45)
vibe hard to tell apart other than their (87:43 - 87:47)
hairstyle and hat yeah cause nate has a (87:45 - 87:48)
visor (87:47 - 87:50)

take it across the world gold is a (91:41 - 91:44)
standard christmas color because (91:43 - 91:47)
of the whole story but relying solely on (91:44 - 91:49)
silver and gold and calling it christmas (91:47 - 91:51)
when there's no other christmas touches (91:49 - 91:53)

they're beautiful but like if if you (91:55 - 91:59)
brought out (91:58 - 92:02)
this mug and plate that just had a (91:59 - 92:04)
silver and gold pikachu (92:02 - 92:07)

this is an all year round serving plate (92:44 - 92:47)
this is my (92:46 - 92:50)
this is not chris this throat blanket (92:47 - 92:51)
which is (92:50 - 92:54)
black and gold pikachu this does not say (92:51 - 92:54)
christmas why (92:54 - 92:57)
we get to extend christmas for eight (92:54 - 92:59)
weeks because instead of just focusing (92:57 - 93:01)
on the word christmas (92:59 - 93:03)
the pokemon company here has focused on (93:01 - 93:04)
the word (93:03 - 93:07)
winter wonders (93:04 - 93:10)
show me silver winter and you can you (93:07 - 93:13)
can winter wonder yourself through (93:10 - 93:15)
november december and some would say (93:13 - 93:18)
possibly january i mean (93:15 - 93:21)
i'm into january the stuff that actually (93:18 - 93:21)
is (93:21 - 93:24)
winter based that has snowflakes that's (93:21 - 93:26)
like the pikachu head in the snowflake i (93:24 - 93:26)
think is (93:26 - 93:30)
is very good but just a weird (93:26 - 93:34)
geometrical patterned pikachu (93:30 - 93:38)
does not scream winter nor holiday (93:34 - 93:41)
nor christmas to me i'm not denying that (93:38 - 93:42)
they're pretty but (93:41 - 93:45)
for uh for a holiday purchase they are (93:42 - 93:46)
not meeting (93:45 - 93:48)
my standard and what i would need it to (93:46 - 93:50)
say this is a holiday (93:48 - 93:52)
event well i mean they did the bulbasaur (93:50 - 93:53)
squirtle (93:52 - 93:57)
pikachu uh charmander stockings and then (93:53 - 93:57)
the (93:57 - 93:58)
the other pikachu pillow a little bit (93:57 - 94:01)
earlier like last week (93:58 - 94:02)
that pikachu is like the gold one with (94:01 - 94:04)
the uh (94:02 - 94:06)
green and red on it oh the ones that i (94:04 - 94:08)
thought were ugly yeah (94:06 - 94:11)
yeah but those have but those stockings (94:08 - 94:15)
all have other businesses (94:11 - 94:17)
you know wintry things they have (94:15 - 94:18)
snowflakes on them (94:17 - 94:21)
they have more traditional (94:18 - 94:24)
holiday colors like the charmander one (94:21 - 94:24)
has (94:24 - 94:26)
they'll have snowflakes on it they all (94:24 - 94:27)
say (94:26 - 94:31)
wintertime these don't (94:27 - 94:33)
this is the it's not a bet it's not a (94:31 - 94:34)
bad thing it's just not a (94:33 - 94:37)
it's not selling me on buying it for (94:34 - 94:38)
christmas (94:37 - 94:40)
although the flameless candle set i (94:38 - 94:41)
might need to buy (94:40 - 94:44)
oh i got those um the other thing i (94:41 - 94:45)
wanted to bring up (94:44 - 94:49)
is the the they got they went real deep (94:45 - 94:50)
they went real hard into the kitchen (94:49 - 94:52)
accessories here (94:50 - 94:54)
they did and there's a lot the pokemon (94:52 - 94:55)
tacks (94:54 - 94:58)
on these christmas accessories (94:55 - 95:02)
are out of the christmas accessory (94:58 - 95:05)
what does that mean wait what i said you (95:02 - 95:07)

i meant to say kitchen i'm sorry oh (95:07 - 95:11)
kitchen accessories (95:10 - 95:15)
so they have a pikachu apron 35. (95:11 - 95:18)
these are not christmassy they're just (95:15 - 95:20)
no pokemon e (95:18 - 95:22)
neither are the other things fyi then i (95:20 - 95:23)
christmas either (95:22 - 95:27)
the pikachu apron is 35 the pikachu (95:23 - 95:30)
dish towels a two pack is 20. i was just (95:27 - 95:32)
at target yesterday and i walked down (95:30 - 95:32)
the (95:32 - 95:34)
aisle where they would sell dish towels (95:32 - 95:36)
because i was like how much is just a (95:34 - 95:40)
dish towel it's like four bucks (95:36 - 95:44)
for one at target and you could probably (95:40 - 95:45)
go to walmart and get it for like two (95:44 - 95:46)
bucks (95:45 - 95:50)
honestly um they have (95:46 - 95:54)
uh cloth napkins four pack for 25 (95:50 - 95:58)
they have the pot holders for 15. (95:54 - 96:00)
a cutting board for 20 and it doesn't (95:58 - 96:01)
look like a big (96:00 - 96:04)
cutting board well it's 17 inches by 10 (96:01 - 96:05)
inches (96:04 - 96:10)
so it's okay it's okay i mean it's (96:05 - 96:12)
it's a smaller end cutting board like (96:10 - 96:14)
it's for cutting (96:12 - 96:17)
carrots and stuff carrots um i think the (96:14 - 96:19)
measuring spoons are okay they're (96:17 - 96:21)
14 but that's again at target i bet you (96:19 - 96:22)
can get a four pack of measuring spoons (96:21 - 96:25)
for like 5.99 (96:22 - 96:27)
um i think the spatulas are a spatula (96:25 - 96:29)
spatulas are a complete ripoff (96:27 - 96:33)
20 for two and i i am positive (96:29 - 96:35)
that you put these into a dishwasher (96:33 - 96:37)
like three times (96:35 - 96:39)
and that'll be a white spatula all the (96:37 - 96:41)
pokemon is going to be gone pikachu will (96:39 - 96:41)
be here (96:41 - 96:45)
pikachu the shape is kind of weird for (96:41 - 96:46)
us (96:45 - 96:49)
i don't it's uh i think the cookie (96:46 - 96:50)
stamps are i think (96:49 - 96:51)
i think of anything on the list the (96:50 - 96:53)
cookie stamps are probably like the (96:51 - 96:54)
thing you would get and probably get (96:53 - 96:57)
value out of especially if you have kids (96:54 - 96:59)
um yeah i think those are fun oh sure (96:57 - 97:01)
teach your kids poor eating habits go (96:59 - 97:02)
right ahead (97:01 - 97:05)
but man the pokemon tax on some of these (97:02 - 97:08)
like the dish towels the thing that is (97:05 - 97:10)
like going to get (97:08 - 97:14)
dirt the white white dish towels for (97:10 - 97:16)
twenty dollars a two pack that are (97:14 - 97:19)
undoubtedly going to get dirty and (97:16 - 97:21)
probably stained forever (97:19 - 97:23)
like if if there's anything that you (97:21 - 97:25)
shouldn't (97:23 - 97:27)
spend money on it's like nice dish (97:25 - 97:30)
towels that are going to get like (97:27 - 97:33)
red tomato sauce permanently (97:30 - 97:36)
once again we are back to (97:33 - 97:39)
these are the dish towels that you at (97:36 - 97:40)
holiday season (97:39 - 97:44)
hang on the handle of your oven intended (97:40 - 97:47)
to wipe anything clean anything or dry (97:44 - 97:49)
anything do not touch my christmas (97:47 - 97:51)

not allowed to use them yeah my parents (97:51 - 97:54)
appreciated me (97:53 - 97:56)
those towels are worth more than you are (97:54 - 97:59)
you think uh forty forty dollars for the (97:56 - 98:00)
tree skirt (97:59 - 98:02)
are tree skirts forty dollars oh no how (98:00 - 98:04)
do you have a tree skirt for an (98:02 - 98:06)
artificial tree (98:04 - 98:09)
cause it makes it look good will i hate (98:06 - 98:10)
christmas you're never going to get (98:09 - 98:12)
positivity out of me (98:10 - 98:14)
i love christmas but christmas tree (98:12 - 98:16)
skirts i mean (98:14 - 98:20)
you can buy a decent looking (98:16 - 98:24)
tree skirt for like 25 bucks (98:20 - 98:26)
and that's a high-end that's kind of a (98:24 - 98:28)
high-end (98:26 - 98:31)
tree skirt this is really expensive (98:28 - 98:34)
i mean it is pokemon tax forty dollars (98:31 - 98:34)
for (98:34 - 98:37)
a silver and go at least at least they (98:34 - 98:39)
put the snowflakes there on it (98:37 - 98:40)
snowflakes on there (98:39 - 98:43)
but it is black with silver and gold i (98:40 - 98:45)
love it i love it (98:43 - 98:47)
um i think the table runner is really (98:45 - 98:49)
really slick too (98:47 - 98:52)
i like a good table runner it's 30 (98:49 - 98:52)
dollars (98:52 - 98:54)
i know that's why i haven't like the (98:52 - 98:56)
only things i think on the list that are (98:54 - 98:58)
reasonable in the pokemon tax i think (98:56 - 99:00)
the i think 25 dollars for a throw (98:58 - 99:01)
pillow (99:00 - 99:04)
is five dollars more expensive than a (99:01 - 99:05)
throw pillow (99:04 - 99:07)
most throw pillows are 20 bucks you're (99:05 - 99:08)
paying 500 (99:07 - 99:11)
5 extra dollars all right here's what (99:08 - 99:12)
we're going to do i'm going to buy (99:11 - 99:14)
a throw pillow you can you can get into (99:12 - 99:16)
my throw pillow break (99:14 - 99:19)
for five dollars and i will send you an (99:16 - 99:22)
exclusive picture of the throw pillow (99:19 - 99:24)
okay i think that's i think the throw (99:22 - 99:26)
pillow where are you paying (99:24 - 99:29)
25 for throw pillows wait how much (99:26 - 99:30)
targets (99:29 - 99:33)
throw pillows at target go from 15 to 25 (99:30 - 99:34)
yeah yeah yeah that's what i'm saying (99:33 - 99:36)
the average price of a throw pillow is (99:34 - 99:36)
20. (99:36 - 99:38)
you go to like an ashley's furniture (99:36 - 99:40)
just around yeah (99:38 - 99:42)
no so i think i think the throw pillows (99:40 - 99:43)
are reasonable (99:42 - 99:44)
the average price of a throw pillow is (99:43 - 99:46)
at most fifteen dollars (99:44 - 99:48)
where are you getting thrown out no no (99:46 - 99:50)
that's low end dude that's low end (99:48 - 99:50)
that's (99:50 - 99:52)
like you use it for a year and then it's (99:50 - 99:55)
not good anymore (99:52 - 99:58)
i think the the mug is thir i (99:55 - 100:00)
i the mug is actually mind-blowing like (99:58 - 100:01)
this has to be a type (100:00 - 100:04)
35 for a mug and a plate (100:01 - 100:08)
this is highway robbery a mug (100:04 - 100:11)
at most should be fifteen dollars (100:08 - 100:12)
oh it's a four piece okay never mind (100:11 - 100:15)
you're getting wait (100:12 - 100:18)
no for the mug includes (100:15 - 100:21)
two mugs and two plates oh okay okay (100:18 - 100:22)
okay actually i take it all back (100:21 - 100:25)
i might order this then oh no (100:22 - 100:28)
[Laughter] (100:25 - 100:31)
okay i take that back i think stockings (100:28 - 100:32)
for 20 is (100:31 - 100:35)
is a ripoff to me but i don't think (100:32 - 100:36)
that's (100:35 - 100:40)
terribly priced because i feel like most (100:36 - 100:43)
most stockings with a brand on it is 20 (100:40 - 100:44)
bucks at target too (100:43 - 100:48)
i think the electric candles are (100:44 - 100:49)
somewhat reasonably priced i think i (100:48 - 100:51)
think so too (100:49 - 100:54)
but i don't know if they're good i don't (100:51 - 100:55)
know if they're the kind that actually (100:54 - 100:56)
flicker they just look like they (100:55 - 100:58)
like they just look like they just light (100:56 - 100:59)
up which is not (100:58 - 101:03)
great but they're kind of cute (100:59 - 101:06)
i may buy i may buy the flameless game (101:03 - 101:08)
we'll see do you think two ortom i think (101:06 - 101:10)
ornaments are always overpriced too (101:08 - 101:13)
two ornaments for 25 no (101:10 - 101:17)
i mean if they were anything other than (101:13 - 101:18)
bulbs (101:17 - 101:21)
bulb ornaments are super cheap and (101:18 - 101:22)
unfortunately (101:21 - 101:25)
that tend to have the the pattern put on (101:22 - 101:28)
as an extra layer and they will scrape (101:25 - 101:29)
off really easy (101:28 - 101:32)
two ball ornaments is not for 25 bucks (101:29 - 101:32)
is (101:32 - 101:35)
not a great price i really like the (101:32 - 101:36)
napkin (101:35 - 101:39)
rings i mean they're good but (101:36 - 101:41)
napkin rings but they ain't christmas or (101:39 - 101:43)
holiday or winter (101:41 - 101:47)
winter wonderland greg you can call it (101:43 - 101:49)
it's a wonderland because i'm wondering (101:47 - 101:51)
what value these pieces of garbage (101:49 - 101:52)
actually have (101:51 - 101:56)
they're made out of brass is that good (101:52 - 101:58)
my worry with the napkin rings is you (101:56 - 102:00)
can just bend them with your hands and (101:58 - 102:02)
then they crack (102:00 - 102:04)
who's sitting there bending your napkin (102:02 - 102:06)
rings smack their hand (102:04 - 102:08)
do not let the children at the table (102:06 - 102:10)
with the napkin rings (102:08 - 102:12)
i'm not buying stuff from my home when (102:10 - 102:14)
nobody's coming to my home for christmas (102:12 - 102:15)
this year yeah but (102:14 - 102:18)
they last forever do they (102:15 - 102:20)
don't look like they will you think (102:18 - 102:22)
twenty dollars for stockings too much (102:20 - 102:25)
yes have a stocking i can't wear on my (102:22 - 102:26)
feet yes (102:25 - 102:28)
have i paid that you bet i have do i (102:26 - 102:30)
think it's too much (102:28 - 102:33)
yes the sad part about this (102:30 - 102:36)
is that the day after halloween they (102:33 - 102:36)
released (102:36 - 102:39)
two halloween items on their store yeah (102:36 - 102:41)
they did which is really weird (102:39 - 102:45)
um the gengar ceramic (102:41 - 102:46)
candle thing and then the pikachu (102:45 - 102:48)
ceramic candle thing (102:46 - 102:50)
i will put okay i will say this about (102:48 - 102:54)
the stockings their stockings are 19.99 (102:50 - 102:58)
most stockings on target are 15 (102:54 - 103:01)
so the tax isn't that bad on those (102:58 - 103:02)
you're paying four bucks more for (103:01 - 103:05)
pikachu so it's not a terrible break (103:02 - 103:08)
question of the week greg all right (103:05 - 103:09)
question (103:08 - 103:12)
of the week come on (103:09 - 103:16)
let's finally hear the question (103:12 - 103:18)
i feel like you've done that before no (103:16 - 103:20)
maybe but i wasn't going to prep (103:18 - 103:21)
anything great for you because you (103:20 - 103:22)
skipping every time (103:21 - 103:25)
all right this is from katherine will (103:22 - 103:27)
there be a question of the week this (103:25 - 103:27)
week's (103:27 - 103:31)
show because i refuse to answer that (103:27 - 103:32)
question there are other questions in (103:31 - 103:34)
that list (103:32 - 103:37)
uh what if what if catherine asked if (103:34 - 103:37)
you had (103:37 - 103:40)
to pitch a pokemon roguelike what would (103:37 - 103:41)
you have the game (103:40 - 103:44)
loop be like could somebody please (103:41 - 103:46)
define what a roguelike is because i'm (103:44 - 103:46)
never (103:46 - 103:49)
100 certain on what that means (103:46 - 103:53)
so roguelike games i believe (103:49 - 103:56)
is you run that's like an action (103:53 - 104:00)
adventure type game it's like a rogue (103:56 - 104:00)
legacy (104:00 - 104:03)
a hades a uh and (104:00 - 104:07)
it's you go and if you die or lose (104:03 - 104:08)
you are reset to the beginning with (104:07 - 104:12)
nothing and you start over again (104:08 - 104:12)
so what is the loop so what what that's (104:12 - 104:16)
what they're asking is what's the loop (104:15 - 104:17)
what would be (104:16 - 104:19)
going through and getting to the end and (104:17 - 104:20)
then starting back over (104:19 - 104:23)
again if you died in there also the (104:20 - 104:24)
roguelike is (104:23 - 104:25)
supposed to be different every time you (104:24 - 104:27)
play it right splunky (104:25 - 104:29)
is another one trying to think of a (104:27 - 104:30)
roguelike that will (104:29 - 104:33)
might have played without knowing (104:30 - 104:36)
splunky (104:33 - 104:36)
games let me look to see if i can find (104:38 - 104:42)
something um hades is the popular one (104:39 - 104:44)
that just came out (104:42 - 104:47)
nope technically pokemon mystery dungeon (104:44 - 104:49)
is a roguelike ah (104:47 - 104:50)
[Music] (104:49 - 104:54)
dead cells slay the spire uh (104:50 - 104:57)
binding of isaac i still don't (104:54 - 104:59)
understand what the loop means (104:57 - 105:02)
just i don't know don't starve i think (104:59 - 105:05)
i'm qualified to answer this question (105:02 - 105:07)
so the loop is so like in mystery (105:05 - 105:08)
dungeon you think you run through the (105:07 - 105:09)
dungeon with just what you bring in (105:08 - 105:10)
there (105:09 - 105:12)
and when you leave the dungeon those all (105:10 - 105:14)
go back into a pool (105:12 - 105:16)
and then you pick things up again and (105:14 - 105:17)
then you go to the next thing (105:16 - 105:20)
so the loop is you go through a section (105:17 - 105:21)
and then you go (105:20 - 105:24)
back to a home base and then you pick (105:21 - 105:25)
where to go next (105:24 - 105:29)
that sort of like the roguelike is (105:25 - 105:32)
you take a certain amount of things to a (105:29 - 105:34)
location and try to get to that location (105:32 - 105:34)
and if (105:34 - 105:36)
you lose in there you get sent back with (105:34 - 105:38)
nothing if you win (105:36 - 105:39)
you take the treasures back they go into (105:38 - 105:41)
a thing and then you can (105:39 - 105:43)
build that up again to take it somewhere (105:41 - 105:44)
else so we've already (105:43 - 105:46)
had a pokemon roguelike yeah i mean (105:44 - 105:47)
mystery dungeon is that but if there was (105:46 - 105:48)
gonna be another one (105:47 - 105:51)
yeah but what about what if it was good (105:48 - 105:53)
i'm leaving that one there i'm not (105:51 - 105:56)
commenting on your hatred um (105:53 - 105:59)
i would like see i think it'd be (105:56 - 106:01)
interesting to have (105:59 - 106:05)
a a snap like game where you pick (106:01 - 106:07)
x amount of pokemon and you go to an (106:05 - 106:08)
area with those and then you catch them (106:07 - 106:10)
and then they go to your (106:08 - 106:13)
professor pen and then you pick from (106:10 - 106:14)
there to go to the next (106:13 - 106:18)
like grasslands like like somewhat (106:14 - 106:20)
misreduction except you're the trainer (106:18 - 106:22)
and you're picking your team (106:20 - 106:25)
of various of various pokemon to go to a (106:22 - 106:26)
certain location (106:25 - 106:28)
like for a lava things i'm going to take (106:26 - 106:30)
all water and then (106:28 - 106:33)
and then if you get knocked out those (106:30 - 106:35)
pokemon that you rented (106:33 - 106:37)
are released to the wild and then you (106:35 - 106:39)
have to go back and try to go through (106:37 - 106:40)
with what you had and try to go to (106:39 - 106:41)
earlier dungeons to (106:40 - 106:44)
rebuild your pokemon pool so i would say (106:41 - 106:47)
my version um in in hearing all of this (106:44 - 106:49)
information and everything (106:47 - 106:51)
would be called dynamaxx adventure and (106:49 - 106:54)
you'd start out and you'd rent a pokemon (106:51 - 106:56)
and you'd go through the dungeon and you (106:54 - 106:57)
could collect pokemon as you go through (106:56 - 106:59)
the dungeon but you only get to keep one (106:57 - 107:00)
when you finish (106:59 - 107:02)
i mean dynamic adventure is a roguelike (107:00 - 107:04)
section of that game (107:02 - 107:05)
yeah i wouldn't like i wouldn't say it's (107:04 - 107:07)
like a hardco it's like it has (107:05 - 107:10)
it has rogue-like mechanics right have (107:07 - 107:12)
you ever played darkest dungeon (107:10 - 107:15)
yeah well do you ever play darkest (107:12 - 107:18)
dungeon because that's a hybrid (107:15 - 107:20)
no i have not okay dead cells is my my (107:18 - 107:22)
favorite roguelike and the thing about (107:20 - 107:23)
dead cells is (107:22 - 107:24)
like when you die obviously you start (107:23 - 107:26)
over um (107:24 - 107:29)
but when you go through and you you can (107:26 - 107:32)
only hold two different weapons (107:29 - 107:33)
and so when you knock out an enemy or (107:32 - 107:35)
when you open treasure chests which (107:33 - 107:36)
everything's randomized every time you (107:35 - 107:38)
go through (107:36 - 107:41)
you might get weapons that you get to (107:38 - 107:43)
pick and choose right like i want (107:41 - 107:45)
a bow and arrow and a shield or i want (107:43 - 107:46)
two swords (107:45 - 107:49)
or i want a sword and a hammer or i love (107:46 - 107:50)
having the hammers but the game isn't (107:49 - 107:52)
dropping me hammers so i guess i have to (107:50 - 107:53)
use (107:52 - 107:56)
um like a a knife which is different (107:53 - 107:57)
than a sword (107:56 - 108:01)
so i it would be cool if uh if i have to (107:57 - 108:03)
be put on the spot to design a game (108:01 - 108:06)
where you might have some choice at the (108:03 - 108:08)
beginning of like maybe i want these (108:06 - 108:09)
pokemon (108:08 - 108:10)
maybe i want to fire pokemon maybe i (108:09 - 108:11)
want to water pokemon but when you're (108:10 - 108:13)
going through (108:11 - 108:17)
the loot boxes will let you learn (108:13 - 108:19)
different moves like if i was a (108:17 - 108:20)
charizard (108:19 - 108:24)
i could learn flamethrower (108:20 - 108:26)
but i can only remember like four moves (108:24 - 108:28)
at once so then i come through and (108:26 - 108:31)
i can have rockslide (108:28 - 108:33)
but then i go through and it's like well (108:31 - 108:34)
i don't have room for rock slide (108:33 - 108:36)
flamethrower scratch and (108:34 - 108:39)
snarl so charger can't learn snarl but (108:36 - 108:42)
now i have overheat but that does damage (108:39 - 108:43)
to me but it does more damage should be (108:42 - 108:45)
cool too (108:43 - 108:46)
that's the only thing i could think of (108:45 - 108:48)
is instead of randomizing your weapons (108:46 - 108:50)
like a lot of these games do (108:48 - 108:53)
you randomize what your pokemon can (108:50 - 108:54)
learn (108:53 - 108:59)
although i don't think i don't think (108:54 - 109:01)
well does mystery dungeon have it where (108:59 - 109:03)
if you like completely fail you lose (109:01 - 109:04)
everything (109:03 - 109:07)
yeah if you don't get rescued then you (109:04 - 109:08)
do lose a bunch of stuff out of your (109:07 - 109:09)
back (109:08 - 109:10)
okay because that's the big thing about (109:09 - 109:12)
roguelikes is like yep if you lose you (109:10 - 109:13)
lose it all (109:12 - 109:16)
but you can and like dead cells be like (109:13 - 109:19)
uh i'm going to i'm i'm canceling out (109:16 - 109:20)
this run to (109:19 - 109:22)
you know take the money back and put in (109:20 - 109:23)
my bank because i don't want to lose all (109:22 - 109:24)
the money and i don't think i can keep (109:23 - 109:25)
going (109:24 - 109:27)
i heard hades is very good that's what (109:25 - 109:29)
i've heard hades is amazing that's the (109:27 - 109:30)
newest uh (109:29 - 109:32)
road i'm trying to think there are some (109:30 - 109:33)
roguelike (109:32 - 109:35)
board games out there and i'm trying to (109:33 - 109:37)
think of (109:35 - 109:40)
pandemic legacy (109:37 - 109:40)
don't know if that (109:40 - 109:44)
i don't think so (109:44 - 109:47)
uh well what's our pokemon of the week (109:48 - 109:52)
well last week's pokemon uh all i need (109:50 - 109:52)
to say (109:52 - 109:55)
to remind everybody of it was it should (109:52 - 109:57)
be dark type and it's not (109:55 - 110:00)
it's (109:57 - 110:00)
chatter it should be a darkness that's (110:01 - 110:06)
hot should be dark type because it was (110:04 - 110:07)
banned for so long because of foul (110:06 - 110:08)
language (110:07 - 110:11)
i'll play on that chat (110:08 - 110:11)
it's giraffe rig giraffe i took so much (110:14 - 110:20)
heat for this man (110:18 - 110:22)
there are so many giraffe rig fans out (110:20 - 110:24)
there man they are ready to defend (110:22 - 110:27)
that little guy to the end of time (110:24 - 110:30)
with little help cannot agree with you (110:27 - 110:31)
it should be dark (110:30 - 110:32)
you do agree with me or you don't agree (110:31 - 110:36)
with me i do it's booty is dark it's (110:32 - 110:36)
front is (110:36 - 110:39)
not yes um that's and that's one of the (110:36 - 110:40)
arguments i had was like (110:39 - 110:42)
if you didn't want it to look like it (110:40 - 110:44)
should be dark type then (110:42 - 110:47)
make the back end pink and make that (110:44 - 110:49)
little head a little less angry looking (110:47 - 110:51)
yeah it's i don't think i've ever seen (110:49 - 110:53)
its tail not be angry (110:51 - 110:57)
ooh shiny jurassic has a blue nose (110:53 - 111:01)
yeah stronger japanese cool i got one in (110:57 - 111:04)
pearl why i don't know i was doing pokey (111:01 - 111:05)
radar and i got one (111:04 - 111:09)
release it it's no good nah he's cute (111:05 - 111:12)
he's weak to dark and bug (111:09 - 111:16)
early designs he had a full (111:12 - 111:19)
full giraffe head as its second half (111:16 - 111:22)
see that would be cool yeah that would (111:19 - 111:24)
make sense (111:22 - 111:26)
because if it's kind of his name is (111:24 - 111:29)
palindromic much like the episode number (111:26 - 111:30)
yeah even in like gold and silver it's (111:29 - 111:33)
like its tail has a small brain of its (111:30 - 111:34)
own beware if you get close it might (111:33 - 111:36)
react to your scent and bite you (111:34 - 111:40)
yeah biting is bad (111:36 - 111:42)
yeah and bite is also a dark type move (111:40 - 111:44)
it comes right before crunch (111:42 - 111:49)
that's right 10 chance to flinch (111:44 - 111:51)
no thirty thirty n bite and then i think (111:49 - 111:53)
ten percent to lower special defense on (111:51 - 111:55)
crunch (111:53 - 111:57)
uh i think traffic is fine i think he's (111:55 - 111:58)
all right (111:57 - 112:03)
he's fine the very cute (111:58 - 112:06)
shuffle icon but it's only of its front (112:03 - 112:07)
head and not of its butt head (112:06 - 112:11)
yeah is there any trivia on draft freak (112:07 - 112:16)
i gave it i gave it to you in the (112:11 - 112:18)
original design it was a giraffe on both (112:16 - 112:19)
ends it was giraffes all the way down (112:18 - 112:22)
