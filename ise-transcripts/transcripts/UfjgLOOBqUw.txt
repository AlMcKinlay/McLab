so [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 483rd episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective what no no no no no am i requesting just a giant jumping and i'm like i'm used to the papa whistle suddenly we're just in the episode good grief it was just go go go go go go go spj with me is greg hello i am your host greg with me as spj uh take that wow wow will is here so what's more important the fact that i got a sick pump at the gym this morning because i did a total bro workout yeah yeah or i it was literally just chest and arms it is like the most bro workout possible or the end of gardenscapes what i i didn't delete it but i have gotten to a level that i will never be able to get past and therefore i've installed solitaire and actually find solitaire to be that much more fun what a twist oh and you won't join me on my game though what oh no no no no because that is so much false advertising with there's so much fun gardenscapes too they actually put in those things from their ads because they got so many complaints about the false advertising project makeover i ain't not shaving anybody's head or applying it yeah yeah yeah yeah you don't even you just pick the colors they do it's super easy to get interested in other actual human beings lives to care about their well-being let alone virtual humans who can't make decisions about what clothes to wear so that animal crossing update then uh okay let's uh we'll have some pokemon news uh i well moving in less than two weeks so the sense of urgency for me might be high uh but i just want to make sure we have some good shows and if they're not 40 hours long like they normally are that's probably why also there's no news nothing is happening uh uh i can always find something i'm pretty good you can always find something that doesn't mean it's worth talking about we'll still talk about it let's let's start with pokemon go stuff first uh i do want to start off with the twitch rivals uh because i thought that was kind of cool so two things uh one i stream on twitch twitch tv slash pk mencap and two there is something called twitch rivals which is like a competitive thing that twitch puts together and then that goes on like the front page of twitch um it's like they're big esports things and normally twitch rivals is like apex legends or call of duty or valorent uh all the stuff you would expect to be competitive and they would pick um usually pros but also like bigger streamers and the ideal is like obviously the bigger bigger streamers bring in the more casual competitive people the pros it's supposed to like you know bump up it's like what worlds does for pokemon you know gets people excited for competitive and niantic and the pokemon company partnered with twitch and they did the first ever twitch rivals pokemon go thing which is highly ironic that greg and i complained about uh the pokemon go competitive thing uh he wouldn't say complained i would say poked fun app but you know what the only thing i could think of when i was listening to that whole conversation was greg has never been to a worlds nope that's true so he doesn't get the concept of sitting in the audience and watching people play a video game because you act like a headline about i have never sat in an audience watching people play video games before i just have never done it for pokemon yeah for a lot of things there's there's not a far distance between watching somebody play competitive pokemon go and watching somebody play competitive vgc pokemon just because there's battle animations doesn't make it watching the two people sit across from each other at a table with their screens projected on the large screen any better yeah but that's not new pokemon go part was new it's right for conversation right conversation twitch rivals twitch rivals so they they they broke it into um three parts which i think is cool and i think that's you know i said last week that i i felt like pokemon go battling is is kind of a coin flip and that even if even if the leg which is the biggest problem with pokemon go was fixed it's still like kind of missing something uh and i don't know what that is but i can say at least when the twitch rivals they broke it into three parts they broke it into so so niantic or i should probably say twitch so twitch sent all 15 16 18 people i was part of this by the way so they picked me they picked some other people in the pokemon go community and then they picked um they picked uh six irl streamers so it was kind of a cool concept they had six like pros i was not a pro that's okay i would never consider myself a pro in pokemon go battling please don't let me get there so they picked six pros they picked six whatever like pro high profile streamers i guess i was one of them and then they picked six irl streamers and the whole point was the iron streamers were going to go outside for an hour and catch pokemon the my people were going to sit at home and catch pokemon the coaches were going to sit at home and catch pokemon but then the coaches also had the added responsibility of like making sure their other two people the irl and then my people um would be able to build a competitive team and so that that first session was like an hour and on paper ideally good but also like irl gear is very hard to manage and get set up and they were out and about and then they had to get back and so that was a little messy but um the first hour niantic or sorry twitch sent us these phones these phones had special accounts on them all ready to go they had 300 pokeballs no berries they had like incense they had um like 1500 rare candy they had uh like elite tms and stuff so they were they were ready to go specifically for this tournament and then they gave us special spawns and they were like these like 25 pokemon will be spawning in an hour you can catch them and then those are the pokemon you'll be able to use for battle so that was actually really cool so we we i set my office chair right here i caught pokemon for an hour before we went into it my coach was like okay these are the teams i thought of who wants what team and i was like oh i want the swampert skirmery team she's like okay so obviously you know make sure you catch all the swamperts all the or the mudkips all the skirmeries and then catch these other pokemon to flush out your team and then the irl guy was like the vigoroth um charizard team because that was like a little bit easier and then she had like a more advanced team because one of the rules was if i'm using mudkip um or skarmory no my other two partners on my team cannot so that was pretty cool um that makes sense but yeah spoiler i i didn't get a scar marie so because i didn't get a skarmory um well i did but it was over 1500 cp so i couldn't use it uh i took her i think uh we traded so i was like i'll just use knocked owl because i caught hoot hoot and then you'll use the skarmory you caught and then that'll be fine so that was like the like rng because you you're playing for an hour you don't know what's spawning in front of you and also like i was lucky enough to catch like six mod kips but four of my mudkips would have been way over the 1 500 cp for a swampert um so the first hour was like very chill but like very like okay we're catching pokemon for an hour this is cool hopefully you know i get everything on my list and for not having berries and only having pokeballs catching mud kips and slack-offs was incredibly stressful because you're like i don't want them to run and i don't have like ultras and i don't have golden razzes and like obviously if i was on my own account this would i'd catch everything and then it went into the powering up right so you're going through now i ended up catching 69 pokemon in an hour uh and then i was like don't have a skarmory okay i have the hoot hoot okay which ones of these are i'm going to power up i'm going to use an elite charge tm on swamper to get a hydro cannon and then for i guess i'm very lucky or knowledgeable about pokemon go so my coach didn't have to spend too much time with me she had to spend a lot of time with the other guy who uh decided not to check any of the cp and then throw away all his slack-offs except one and then uh power up his slack off to 1500 before they evolved it ah and then um let's just say instead of having a charizard he had a 1 500 cp charmeleon going into his battles but all the irl people were at a pretty i don't think any of the ir people were were they were all like didn't play pokemon go since the launch of the game so that was a little hectic um but the coolest part that i wanted to talk about is when we did get to the battles it was you you had six pokemon that you powered up to 1500 cp and so it was just like vgc you saw six pokemon so uh twitch made like a google doc showed all six pokemon everyone was using um like i was using the the knocked owl and the ariados and the galvantula and the um swampert and the whatever the other obama snow and then i saw their six and then i narrowed it down to three and it was best two out of three so i got team preview there was tv it was just through a google doc uh but that was the most exciting part and it really felt like i built it i built a team of six i looked at their team of six and i made the correct choices going in versus i just have three they just have three whoever has the better lead is clearly at the advantage of this match um and so that felt that felt actually really fun um and so i enjoyed my time with rivals i won four of my matches only lost one uh and my team came last so oh it wasn't my fault oh that's all that matters it wasn't my fault just like in unite just like in unite so i hope they do more of that because the i think watching the process of catching building and then doing it was actually really exciting to people they don't really get to see that kind of part of pokemon go that's true seeing how the burrito is stuffed uh speaking of pokemon go there is there the halloween event is happening right now they got more hat pokemon you want a piplup with a hat they got it you want pikachu with a hat always more hat so i have a fundamental question about the piplup and the pikachu hats do they feel really christmassy to you because they feel really christmassy to me i haven't seen them i guess i can see what you're saying i think with the pikachu the bow tie throws it off because it looks like a candy cane bow tie for christmas yeah well i mean the people in my neighborhood have started putting up their christmas lights so maybe we have a very short window i just feel like both people up when i first saw it i'm like am i getting the wrong event because this is really christmassy and then i looked at the graphic i'm like no this is the right hats they just look christmasy you know it's funny it's like i'm scrolling through pokemon go live and they like revamped their website what like two months ago or something and they do the thing where they have like the little shiny symbol next to pokemon like one star raids is glaring slowpoke marcos greggy yeah mask esper and then like the little shiny symbols on marco and yamask but if you like go through the shiny symbols on more things than not and it's like that's something that like fans have always made like those like graphics of what's shiny and what's not but there's nothing the pokemon company has ever done because it was always like all or nothing uh it's like it could either be shiny or it can't so i feel like there's gonna i wonder what year or what point that it's just everything is like a chance of shiny in pogo and we don't have to have this little like well uh everything in eggs is shiny except for golet and it's it's a little silly uh there's a spooky cup which is cool uh it's or the halloween cup i should say that's happening um this the season of mischief story goes to the next part there's special time research there's some really good event bonuses this time around twice the transfer candy always on twice the catch candy always on twice the hatch candy always on and then guaranteed xl candy when walking with your buddy so really really really good bonuses happening the three costume pokemon we talked about they added a giant pikachu pumpkin head which actually looks really good in game yeah it looks pretty good like like they somebody at the modeling team figured out how to make the model and it's not clipping really weird like other things they added some more face stickers uh they added the halloween music they released gallerian slow king which i think was broken at first but i believe they fixed it they turned spinner rack shiny um that is the new shiny this event so uh don't ignore those spinner racks and i don't want a shiny spinner rack so that's okay and then on october 22nd there's a part two that's when phantom trevident pumpkin boo and gorgeys will appear for those who are unfamiliar with x and y uh and have not known anything about pumpkaboo there are four sizes of pumpkaboo which will be added to pokemon go there's the small size the average size the large size and then the supersize and so um i wonder how easy it's going to be able to tell in the game you have to listen to the cry because they have different but i mean now that's in in the regular games but it's going to be that hard and didn't go maybe i just maybe you can tell from looking at them i mean you should be able i mean the problem it's it's like you can usually tell three of the four and then it's it's unless you have all four it's like it's kind of hard to put them in what order but there's they're saying here on niantic's website small and average are easily able to find in the wild and large and supersized are going to be rare in the wild um and if you definitely a hundred percent want only average size pumpkaboo it will be in one star raids [Laughter] there will be no super size or no small it's only average in one star raids and then darkrai will be back and then mega apps will make its debut um and that's kind of it that's kind of our pokemon go minute but i don't know they kind of niatik always kind of kills it around halloween i feel like their halloween events are always no they don't they always forget to focus on ghosts and that's all giggling and nothing but giggling first time ever i i don't remember any other halloween pokemon go events so sure this this is great knock it out of the part again i could not i could not tell you at all what happened last year there are costumes weren't there people like i'm sure there were hats there are hats is that when sableye looking like a liquid came out i remember that yeah it was also when gengar had like the tim burton costume going on oh is gengar in a s uh banette yeah that was it yeah i remember that vaguely a lot of zippers and a lot of a lot of stitches what stitches this is a tim burton costume that oh you like a nightmare before christmas like stitching across the mouths of my face never seen that movie i will never see that movie i'm sure some tcg news here is mew v-max bolton v-max and more in pokemon tcg i don't know i really struggled with that headline this is pokemon.com use your tcg battle styles of the upcoming sword and shield fusion strike containing more than 260 cards gosh this expansion introduces the new battle style called fusion strike embrace the fluidity of this style and the adaptability of the new pokemon v while also using powerful new single strike and rapid strike cards and don't overlook the power of several pokemon v-max appearing in giganta max form they show off mew they shot bolton they shot off huntail huntail and again look at that both of them are fused what's okay what is the difference between the strikes yeah i mean well it's correct me if i'm wrong but if i believe like you pick one of the battle styles and then you only include cards that have that same battle style in your deck so there will be cards that are tuned towards a particular battle style so is a fusion let you use that it's just a new either or is it a third category it's a third one so there's there's uh rapid single and then fusion so now there's three um i can kind of break this down a little bit better single strike pokemon are normally pokemon that just hit harder but don't do anything too special it's usually like some extra plus tens or some extra plus 20s um they they are simpler but they hit a little bit harder somebody's gonna be like well but this car yeah there are exceptions but that's like the general feel in vanguard we call that an unga bunga deck you don't have to think just unga bunga hit him hard and then rapid strike is more like uh not hitting as hard but maybe more acceleration maybe more like going into your deck more setup combos yeah more combos perfect and then i don't know what the heck fusion's trick is doing they show a fusion strike mute my confusion comes because fusion strike huntail says single strike jammer fusion strike gorbach says rapid strike canceller because they they prevent those they're specifically so they prevent those decks from working so is fusion like it's just a counter is it the blue is it hard blue magic deck controller controls shuts down yeah fusion sounds like a more control uh which is shutting down other abilities boo uh here's the thing people are really excited about the set because there's like a secret rare mew looks really great i'm sure bobby wants it is it shiny 260 cards just just don't even buy packs just buy the card you want like you're not gonna pull it that's that that that's the problem with these sets the like chilling rains is enormous and so is evolving skies that it feels like you don't get anything you want because they're just so filler heavy because they have so many cards and even if you get something rare you're like oh this isn't the rare one because cool i got another graplock v what am i gonna do with the grab block the only way is to buy a case yeah and then you have seven thousand filler cards and like five seven sell the fillers exactly now buy singles kids yeah yeah i we have to see more cards from fusion striker or what they're doing but 260 cards no thank you that's so many that's a lot of cards [Laughter] it's all the cards uh also off pokemon.com the 25 pokemon 25 album is now available digitally and on cd don't make my mistake go to target walk down the vinyl aisle and be like where's the vinyl that doesn't come out till february yup i did not know that and i didn't even think of getting the cd because i was like so set on like i'm just gonna get the vinyl because that's the cool thing so i gotta go back on the target cd like is there any target does have an exclusive um i think it just comes with like bonus stickers and i think the cases or the cover is different or whatever the book the thing that goes inside yeah the insert there's no like bonus songs it's just there's probably a sticker on it and then it comes with stickers did you guys listen to the jay balvin song yeah that is finally of them all finally somebody understood the assignment somebody made a pokemon song with pokemon in it i am such a huge fan now i didn't understand a word that was being said i mean it was like you'd be on fire like charizard yeah i mean i looked up a translation after but the first time i watched i'm like oh i don't know this like the song title is ten audio i think it's like be careful or it's like cuidado oh right that sounded fancy uh i believe it's beware yeah take care be careful be careful beware something like that um but that video is really good and the song actually has pokemon and i'm impressed and uh they win they win they wow they filmed the assignment they're the person in the group project that was like no this is pokemon related greg none of this none of that unfortunate thing though is that he cheated off bad bunny we all know this just bad bunny wasn't asked to be on the album um i think for our patrons for the the people that get the pa the the like event tickets that we do every month i think we'll do like a listening party for that um [Music] in the dis obviously we have to do everything through the discord because they slack has zero audio tools unfortunately i think even the paid slack doesn't have any audio tools but um i think we'll do a listening party for that because uh if i don't set aside time to listen to this album i will not listen to this album so uh i have to listen to the music you you really only listen to spoken uh i i came back i came back to music i'm in the kids came back to a music verse just say k-pop and music in the same sentence oh come on you have one person that you listen to one that is not listening to music that is standing an individual i am i'm very entertainment actually i i've listened to a lot of bts this past week only because my wife had a 10-hour bts session with our friend and uh i was there and what are you what do you do when you're working out what do you listen to oh wait i was just like when okay and when i'm washing the dishes and when i'm cleaning the house i do have podcasts on that is not listening to music and then it's not clanging and banging i understand you i understand you would need music to clang and bang that is that is true i've listened to podcasts while clanging and banging previously oh i can't i can't i can't i can't have them chatting in my ears and i'm trying to count my reps that makes sense well if you're just running you could probably if i'm on the bike yeah i'll listen i will listen to that no mark this is 2021 no cardio cardio eats gains no this is not the year of cardio sorry when i don't move i have to do some cardio because i'm literally sitting in this room for 16 hours uh they said pokemon 25 album is now available digitally or with cds are sold there is also a special cover special colored vinyl of the album coming in february in celebration of pokemon day um and i think again there is two vinyls there is the i think it's a yellow vinyl which actually looks really good and then there's a target special vinyl which is like the pokeball which oddly enough doesn't look as good i don't know they picked a really good yellow for the vinyl i don't know it's the best color what what are we at for time here uh oh we got time okay that'll just switch over to i was i was i was thinking it was like dude i split here take a break half i was half on board buying a cd then i thought i will never listen to this and i don't want it in my house next to the burger king gold-plated cards no no this is not going to make money people are going to be like this isn't even pokemon related except for the j balvin song and they're the only one that understood the assignment and it's gonna be that's why we need the listening party yeah i see i could put the cd like on this shelf but then it would block something else although something important the pikachu game boy picture frame is empty if the cd would fit in that we could do it but no um so good timing i guess and i do i do like that they're doing this even though it's like really expensive but they they hyped up this music all year they had the music pokemon go fest they trickled these songs out through the year and now on pokemon center this is off pokemon.com they're collaborated with some audio company and company and they're releasing like 500 headphones yeah which is like no kind of unreal okay so brand new this is my skateboard y'all this is my skateboard they're releasing more skateboards by the way i didn't have that in our notes but there is a series four of skateboarding oh get your hands out of my wallet pokemon or no go that is my that i will get a roselia skateboard and nothing else it's gonna be there's gonna be a rosella skateboard in like 20 50. check that instagram post you can i don't think that's going to be resilia yeah i think you're wrong brand collaborations with grotto labs and u-turn audio as well as the pokemon greatest hit collections offer both style and substance in the first round of products available through pokemon center um so they they did some shirts and then they the more important thing here is they they did an easy to use turntable that captures the whimsy and wonder of the pokemon world the orbit turntable produced in calibration of u-turn audio and pokemon center features pikachu spinning around the platter um and they say your music will be as powerful as blastoise hydro pump the first time you play it pretty powerful in pokemon unite if you happen to prefer a personalized experience while listening to the recently released album uh the right pair of headphones is an essential accessory pokemon center collaborated with grotto labs to produce wooden and metal headphones celebrating the spirit of pokemon enhancing your quality of music the housing of the wooden headphones is made of maple chosen from rich tonal qualities while the housing of the metal headphones are bring they don't say what metal it is bring a degree of precision to your music i still don't understand how we got back to vinyl is not bad it's it's not good bad the first three times you play it and then from then on it is hot garbage i like vinyl i do it's it's it's a warmer tone for the first three plays and then it becomes hot garbage full of crap because you naps i like the cracks and i like the snaps yeah but you but also just don't get a crappy 90 80 turntable from target because that thing's gonna not be great here's the thing i do need a new turntable so i i am not one of those vinyl people that are like it sounds perfect it's it's the best way to listen because like flack audio and the the [Laughter] monitor speakers i have on my desk are are a million times better than what a vinyl record can spin out and produce for me but there is something that you can this is why i like vinyl when you got company over or it's just you and your significant other and your house is clean and you lit that candle and you put that vinyl on that is like a mood that is like a thing that you cannot buy and and the nice thing about it it's not that great i did it for 15 years i recently within the past two years have gotten back to listening to albums and not just songs and one of the nice things about vinyl is it enforces that album experience you have to listen to the songs in the order that they were selecting like four bands write album experiences anymore most bands write single experiences i don't think that's accurate like these songs don't even float together it's a lot you you cannot tell me that your pop princesses have created a concept album around pokemon let me put together a list that you'll never listen to because you don't know let me tell you there's no tame in on vinyl and i'm very upset about this are you sure in south korea yeah have you gone to south korea uh where would i look for that i mean i look on amazon and i look down like big whatever there's a big city called seoul so s-e-o-u-l um that is where you would look forward okay i will i will go to seoul this week i will report back i will nothing would motivate me more to actually get a passport than some reason to go to south korea because i love south korea let's go to south korea well i'm left out of this trip yeah well look here we go here here's 500 iq big brain over here the next pokemon go event in south korea will go business expense okay done done and done you just gotta wait for that pokemon go event wait greg what's the last k drama you watched i don't remember what's your favorite kpop band uh that one how do you say okay or that's right in korean meowth that's right no you got no interest in korea get out get out my dms look it's steve korea it is your job to sell me i am the i am the entry level i am in korea and you honestly if you can find the grand shaft it is possibly the greatest k drama ever and you will fall in love with korea either way we have a program to cover steve's still not packed let's we got him that's true also in order for irene to sell me on bts she withheld this tame and knowledge from me and it wasn't until taemin well i could go back and appreciate bts okay i want to talk about this turntable i have like a 120 turntable it's old it's super old it's like i've had it before i met irene it i probably will throw it away honestly or donate it before i move because also turntables are like weirdly odd and i don't wanna broke my move and i only moved four miles yes um the i was told by multiple people that this turntable is incredible but that the pokemon tax on it is is pretty much double they said that you get the same turntable with no pikachu for like 220 and they're charging 380 for this turntable i ain't got that kind of turntable money i gotta save it for a south korea trip yeah um but if it's not sold out by christmas and my wife is like what do you want for christmas i'm gonna say this pikachu turntable i want that too put that on my christmas list okay both will and i want the pikachu turntable you heard it here first greg are you in three turntables yeah he's got no vinyl no i i have i have a basement full of vinyl do not tell me i don't have vinyl i have a basement you don't love it a vinyl and i understand that it is a fundamentally flawed system it is very fly i in my basement have the greatest vinyl album bongos bongos bongos full of bongo music it's amazing so don't at me that i don't know about vinyl i lived it i was there when vinyl was created it was the only act like you weren't you were a child look when vital came back i was a hipster i needed to get into something i know what went wrong in my life remember the day and you have to be from a certain area of the northeast even understand all the words that will be coming out of my mouth in a minute i remember the day i went to caldor to get george michael's faith on vinyl hey okay dude did you ever have the a device on your turntable that you could stack for yes vinyls on top and they would drop yes and then usually oh yeah look we knew the tech back in the day here's the thing you would buy two copies of the album and you'd put side b face up so that after side a on the first one finished then side b would drop down and you didn't have to flip the record over that sounds like a dream i had a vinyl of a spider-man adventure that came with a comic book yeah i should uh i should drop my vinyl player off at a goodwill because it ain't it's not going with it's not making it i don't think i've ever replaced the needle on it either and that like the needle is like 40 bucks and i'm pretty sure that the player itself was 120. this is what they don't tell you about vinyl you have to replace the needle you have to place pieces on like it's it's the same as a car cars aren't great either all right all right let's take a break we come back we got the diamond pearl stuff we should uh talk about and um that's pretty much it just we'll we'll wrap up with the diamond pro stuff then pokemon of the week and question of the week and we will be right back opinions on the new app i'm excited for it i hope it's good it could be bad i hope it's good though all right we got restaurant that's the first restaurant we got we got diago double okay no worries omega enjoy your lunch what okay time in space and [Music] is this that pikachu no way look at that chat holy cow this might be the best tcg set they've ever made for collectors i'm losing my mind like this set is so cool and we are back from our break uh there's more brilliant diamond shining pearl news uh so we're gonna talk about that this there was a couple outlets that got uh early first-hand impressions of the game obviously very controlled because the pokemon company slash nintendo always wants to control the narrative um we're gonna pull my stuff uh we're gonna pull this stuff off game informer my friend john john carson who works at game informer did this stuff so it was like really cool to see a friend be able to play the game early and then talk about it and and stuff so i know ign did some stuff i think like game spot did some stuff but we'll just do the gaming format it's all the same they all got the literally the same exact preview um but then i also i also covered this on the youtube channel youtube.comcast if you want to see my my earlier um thoughts on that too so comes out november 19th we're getting close they almost a month away they show [Music] okay before we go through this let's talk about the thing that everyone's talking about okay what is everybody talking about experience share is not a toggle once again uh but that's that's the norm now i don't know i don't know why this is such a point of contention for some people i mean i understand because i originally had the issue back in the day it's like i want to control the leveling of mine pokemon i don't want it just to be a blanket yes i i get that but when they turned the toggle off they also were they also introduced pc anywhere right and so like in let's go pikachu let's go eevee it was experience share always on but also the first game that no matter where you are take out a pokemon put in a pokemon but those are completely unrelated what what does one have to do with the other because like if you only wanted one pokemon to get experience you could just dump the other five pokemon and if you wanted to do the like the chain thing where it's like i'm gonna send out you level one i'm gonna switch right away to the level ten and then we're both going to get experience because that's how you would do it anyways um you just put the other four in the box but that doesn't work it's like i have my team i'm bringing my team [Laughter] but this is the real issue and i blame the parents of millennials i don't blame the millennials themselves yeah it's the parents problem which is basically i'm gonna say the boomers but who knows if a pokemon does not participate in a battle and i have not designated that pokemon to receive experience why is it getting experienced because they were there literally done nothing but sit in a box get this this is the problem with my shiny bug quest playthrough through pokemon shield frost moth has legit done jack duty because not has never been in a battle but since i had to catch it at level 40 or whatever in the field whatever the the base for a snowman is that you can get the lowest i didn't breed it i caught it fresh caught snow shiny in the field it is at level 50 now because it keeps getting experience for doing nothing it is observing and watching and taking notes as an educator having having examples at the front of the class is a valuable learning tool yes they don't learn as much as perhaps doing the battle but they do learn something from watching and you cannot ignore that aspect of education i i can and also i like to play pokemon games where it's like that you got the guy in the front or gal or non-binary whichever the pokemon identifies as it could be a magnemite correct and like then it gets it's it levels over the next guy or growl or non-binary and then you say you move it up the line and then you keep moving them up the line so that they level evenly but now it's like i poor larvesta is doing all the work look larvae ain't evolving until level 462 anyways like nobody could give the poor kid a break yeah but okay so if you were like uh pokemon games are too easy i don't want to be over leveled that is still your choice like if you if you're going into um if you're going into ray han and reha i don't even know what level reyhon's pokemon are uh if if that dude's pokemon are level 45 and your pokemon is is 42 and you're like i don't want to be above 42 because it's gonna be just put that book by the box it's it's it's fine it's not going anywhere you access the pc anywhere this pokemon hit 42 that's where i want to be drop in the box move on it's fine like you you're still in complete control of your pokemon levels to be like oh my pokemon are getting experience too fast at any point no matter where you are you can go slide that pokemon into a box and it stops getting experience at that point i don't know it's just like it i i see the complaint and i i you're like the being able to have more control of your game is not something i would want to take away from a player i still think that control is there i am more shocked that this is just so controversial versus reversal this is so much of a controversy when almost every other jrpg this has just been a thing forever like i every final fantasy every persona octopath traveler the bravely like default it's just it was it's just a thing the fact that pokemon grinding levels isn't fun the fact that pokemon had like even earlier pokemon games people should be more mad that like in earlier pokemon games you don't get experience here until like the seventh gym and one of them it's like like the heart gold's soul's over what is it it's like after jasmine or something you don't get it so that you can do all that great kanto yeah and on top of that they're like hey dude in the little town hall uh you didn't catch 40 pokemon no experience here for you if you want to grind properly you gotta grind like that that should be the actual outrage um i i don't know i think it's fine i i feel like it's just people complaining for the sake of complaining because hello welcome to 2021 welcome to the internet because like there is still control but it's not the control that they want it's not the control it's not the look a bunch of they want the boomer control back they want that little toggle switch we got more advanced zoomer control where we can do all these things over here i mean i don't think it's more advanced if you took away the toggle switch you made it less advanced like we took away features so it's more advanced they took they took it away but they did replace it with something and look if that if that was the that was the call i'll take pc anywhere anytime oh that's that's the better thing i i mean i don't get why they i still don't fundamentally understand the thought process behind getting rid of the toggle but i don't have to it's just like why yeah yeah i mean they could have both right right and they had both and then they just didn't my only guess is they still want people to finish the game and so if you give that person the option to turn it off and then they get frustrated it's it's the whole shiny lock thing if you if you don't if if if they didn't shiny lock zekram and and then people would sit there which i which there's two arguments of that it's like people will sit there and then they don't see the end of the game and as a creator of a product you want somebody to go through your entire product and consume it the way you envisioned it so i see that point of like i want you to go through this the way i designed you to go through this and then there's the other point of like who get who cares they spent the 40 let them do what they want i like that applies to a lot of things like customization we want you to play this character and only this character so there's no customization like it it is a weird mindset to be like we want you to play it this way and see the end of the game our way it is a it is a strange thing to latch onto because that can apply for a lot of things we only want this character design so you can't customize it yeah we only want these pokemon to be available so that's it like i don't see the benefit of not having the toggle it's not a deal breaker i don't really care it's just one of the it's one of the design choices that i would love to have been there for to hear the reason why why did you take away this functionality what what improvement in the game did you see by taking it away unless they held like focus groups and i mean yeah and i'm curious pokemon i mean i'm curious what what brought about the decision like i would love to know the reasons why behind these things are because i always feel like a lot of people are i mean this is the niantic thing you get upset at the thing because they don't tell you why they made the decision just that they made the decision like everybody got mad at their parents when they said no because i told you so this is sort of the same thing it's like you're not telling us the reasons why you don't make sense of these decisions and so it's going to rub people the wrong way why they put the audio settings on a random npc two gyms in like what not two gyms in but two cities in yeah i mean they just make weird decisions and they you feel like you're in a real world it's not like i can just tap my window and change the brightness it's called drapes you got well i got to go two towns over to get them to get drapes i have to drive to target two towns over to finally find drapes they don't have drapes at target yeah they do not my target off game informer it says a big question is whether these uh is is whether the remix will have hidden machines hms uh since they were cut from the variety of modern pokemon games this time around gym badges will unlock hm moves that can be used around the world you do not have to teach them to your pokemon using an hm like strength will move a boulder uh using an hm like strength to move a boulder will make a wild pokemon appear and use the move for you it doesn't really make any sense but i'll take the convenience over wasting precious move slots uh so we knew the hm thing we knew the yeah but the they unlocked through badges is i that made sense i guess but it's nice to just hear it written down uh you can call on these uh helpful and wild monsters using the new improved pokey po tech pokemon poke the watch like device from diamond and pearl apps on this new poke will include a step counter pokemon friend checker calculator item dowsing machine drawing pad so just confirming that those things are back they john writes my favorite part of the demo was when we ventured into the ground underground a massive subterrarian map that compares in the size of the above ground of sinnoh down in these depths the trainers can uh excavate the excavation escalate there we go items you can find some pokemon statues decorate your secret bases these secret bases are special customizable rooms found in the ground underground depending on which pokemon figures you decorate it will affect which pokemon you can find and catch in the larger underground called hideaways use certain bug statues you will more likely find bug in the hideaway a device in front of your secret base will let you know how the hideaways will be affected a statue statue collection is a big part of the ground underground experience and your overall pokemon collecting strategy some statues even come in a rare shiny version that gives a different effect from their standard counterpart well now they've added five more years to steve's twitch no um tiny statues which i think was what kind of hinted at when we were like why is this statue green and why is the statue like um yeah so yeah i mean i i think if you want a little bit more out of the ch out of this like preview um i i cover it on my youtube channel but it was just like here's some short things here's little details sprinkled here and there uh i i don't know i'm i'm real excited for diamond pearl so who is hosting the launch party this year yeah me yeah that's the way the finger was pointed [Laughter] i mean i might be able to do it because i did it the last time you know why do i got to do it every time you don't have to steve can do it newbie throws the party that's the rules i don't know what situation my house will be in i gotta scream just like i did we gotta i gotta we gotta do the bonus podcast we gotta stream uh we don't have to do anything i am i'm i'm awaiting the countless amount of information that will come from diamond and pearl and and whatnot hey speaking of misinformation just because we can't have a 90 minute episode this week and i'm super sorry for that uh speaking of this information though we'll probably cover this on my twitch stream on monday night if you if people want to come by and get the details here i'll give you the too long didn't read though back when sword and shield came out no one knew the shiny odds and for like a week sarah b just kept changing what that was and it was normal i think most people were like yep this is gonna be different and then and then um pokemon.com put out shiny hunting because they're like this is how you shiny hunt and it it hardly it very much conflicted with what cerebri said now serbia is not a data miner joe over at cereby they work with the data miners and they figure all that out and this is like it took what three weeks for let's go to be pretty much figured out and solidified shiny stuff i think for omega ruby alpha sapphire it took over a year for people to figure out uh dexnav and how dexnav worked um sos took uh like two weeks i think this is not unheard of but it has been almost two years and for some reason for the data miners decided to go back and look at the shiny odds and they have verified that serebii has been wrong for two years and the pokemon.com article has been right the entire time yet and that is what i have always said thank you to the people that like i i have never said that i've i i just found it really weird that pokemon.com would actually go to the efforts to put out a shiny article because they rarely do they they started kind of doing that around like sun and moon they went to the efforts to put it out why would they put it out wrong i don't know so there's there's a lot more to it what was sarah be saying that was wrong it's pretty much pretty much the the too long didn't read of that is brilliant pokemon are increased shinies oh um and by by knocking out you're increasing your brilliant which is increasing your chance for shinies uh what's a brilliant pokemon it's the one with the aura yeah oh the ones that the pokemons yeah the ones that give you watts okay so i'm gonna well well it's it was a data miner they had like it was like 30 tweets in a row i'll go through all that on my twitch stream and then probably just make it into a video and stuff tldr because you're gonna do an instagram a tick tock uh instagram reel i'm sure youtube vid am i wasting my time going to honeycomb see every freaking day and knocking out ten combis or is that what you're telling me where i wanna go that's getting you where you want to go what you are doing is correct okay what you what you are doing is correct it's not like me saying that it's not like well joe was wrong for two years it's just like it's a little frustrating to be like okay why didn't we look more into this like why were we just like pokemon.com is wrong this is right everyone's okay um i i don't know it's because ultimately it doesn't matter and people don't really pay attention to that you're right ultimately it doesn't matter because like even if it whether it's one in four thousand one in thirteen hundred one in eight thousand one still random you're still going to just do the same thing anyways and confirmation bias is going to allow you to to align with whichever one you pay attention to so joe being wrong for two years everybody's like no no that's exactly what happened to me because that's what they had in their brain and that matched up with the pattern ultimately shiny odds because it's still every chance is flipping a coin you unless you have a giant spreadsheet you're never going to actually like remember oh i got this one in four thousand but then this one i got greg sad thing is that a lot of these people who shiny hunt do keep count i mean because so many people ask me it's like how many combies have you gone through i'm like i know i got a lot a lot of these people that shiny hunt also they look at this stuff and i know just some shiny hunters that were very hardcore and they're like well shiny hunting's no fun in sword and shield because it's broken and it's like but it it's it's not broken it's just it's different and we didn't understand exactly how it was until now but if you were to look at syraby's numbers which seems like oh i only knock out five thousand i knock out 500 pokemon and it only works three percent of the time and that's not worth it and it's still that was wrong and but those people looked at it and was like oh this is broken they made it unfun why even do it i'm going to go to another game i get it it's like a little discouraging to be like oh this is a bad way to hunt but then it's like they go back to like crystal and they're like one in eight thousand and you're like yeah i guess yeah i'm gonna go to shiny i'm gonna go to a worse odds because i know it's worse odds yeah spinning around on a bike trying to get a shiny solosis okay but speed past it we're good uh question of the week uh what's the question of the wee eek where is the question of the week in the slack where where are we it's up people added a whole bunch of stuff i don't know what happens on wednesday i know uh kevin sent in some stuff about they made like trainer cards for the pokemon 25 yeah cool that's so hard on an audio podcast i don't know just we'll look at them you can finally battle with katy perry not pikachu jerry the jay baldwin music video is there that was sent in by spencer fire uh bobby said steve has spent more money on pokemon stuff than i have that is very true that's true more money oh you know before sorry we'll talk about this real quick uh this is from um raph uh the shiny zashian and chinese zamasunta are coming to gamestop yeah which is yep that was expected all right greg it's not until the 22nd of october right i know where the spooky game stop is so spooky gamestop you're not gonna be able to buy anything because they have no inventory okay except wii u games and i just plugged my wii u back in so that's exciting for me let's take a trip let's take it uh uh robert writes in and said boy i got a lot of thoughts about this question when did mythicals become less memorable never never i don't think they have been what does less memorable mean i think people i would assume oh no i can tell you exactly where marshado no i don't because i you know who even thinks of rabbit guy as well rabbit guys exactly no crown tundra he's not a bit oh calorics he's not a medical he's legendary oh good lord then who's the mythical for for sword and shield here's the thing that ruined it mythical for sword and shield yeah mel metal and well not met well yeah whatever when they started releasing the mythicals five years after the game came out and you forgot okay wait mcgiron is from alola wait what you're no okay i think vanguard is fine too okay they're fine they're just forgettable they're no mews they're not they're no selling not forgettable they're not your ratchet what okay i here's the thing that ruined mythicals for people and people will i will give you the mythical that ruined mythicals for people but they're they're ignoring everything else that pokemon is victini no no slander get out your mouth and this is all your guys's fault everyone who listens to this podcast all these pokemon fans on twitter this is all of your guys's fault they put extra effort into victini they gave victini his own island i know when you bought the game you didn't have to go anywhere else you walked into gamestop you got the game they handed you a code card you went back to chipotle in mall of america you sat down you entered the code card under mystery gift and then when you got to that i when you got to castellia city you could take the boat over to get victini they put so much effort into that it was and they did not do it before and they did not do it after and you know why because all these pokemon fans complained that gen 5 was bad gen 5 had so much hate compared to sword and shield and all these other games why would they do it again and to and if you want to say mythicals before then mew all you had to do was go to toys r us there was nothing special about that you had to go to toys r us you had to talk to some employee getting paid 7 25 an hour with uh high waisted pants hating their life because they're interacting with 12 year olds and parents that are probably very pretentious about their children if you wanted jirachi you got to buy a bad genius sonority game on the gamecube in order to get jirachi or go to your friend's house to trade it like let's not pretend that they were that special there was nothing special about buying a fifty dollar bad game for the nintendo gamecube to get it directly about special it's about memorable and you've already now answered the question with the actual answer the problem is you no longer if there's it's two parts number one you no longer have to go anywhere to get a mythical i got zeroed in my email inbox right now right i don't have to do any i don't have to put any effort i don't have to talk to the creepy shop but no not that's not special they're not i think they're all memorable but then i think they're all memorable they're they're talking about like i have the experience of going to this place and hooking my game boy to the guy at toys r us game boy and he transferred the mew like i had that experience so that's number one but the answer is the answer to the question is they do so many distributions now that any distribution is not exciting it's like there's something everywhere there's some code this poke pkm cast on instagram is like here's the code of the month get get this crappy pokemon that they're spitting out for free mythicals became less memorable when you became an adult mythicals have been the same since toys r us they've been the same since day one m for mythical m for marketing that is of they have always been a marketing tool to get you to buy ranger to get you to buy coliseum to get you through the door and gamestop to get you to sign up for a newsletter to convince you to play pokemon go to convince you to go to toys r us they have literally only been if you if you have not realized this in 25 years that they have been a marketing tool zarood is for you to be like i got this a rude huh maybe i should check out that movie on netflix when you became an adult and realized it was all marketing is when they became less memorable that is the actual difference between mythical pokemon and legendary pokemon legendary pokemon are the things at the end of the game that you're supposed to chase mythical pokemon are marketing materials m for marketing that is this is from our youtube if you're watching on youtube thank you feel free to like subscribe leave a comment we had a lot of questions this week so i i read all the questions i'm unfortunately we can't get to all the questions so feel free to copy and paste your question if you know you really want to try to answer it i i don't mind we'll get to it eventually um uh opossum posse writes in which tcg card is your absolute favorite and why oh that's hard to pick greg doesn't have one i don't have one wait we don't have this not even ancient mew hmu is worthless yeah but it could still be your fate they're not that there's it's just your favorite i so i would say my top three and it's like really focused on the deck that i played the most uh darkrai is up there hydrogen is up there and then of course you had to have sableye and you had to have the good sableye you're talking about jungkook's this junk hunt say black yeah i think junk hunt sableye has got to be my favorite tcg card oh somebody gave greg some roselias because i like the art in both of these those are cute i would say i don't like the yard in this one yeah that one's not good i do i remember that card i will say i have this uh hollow flashy rose raid that i like ooh that one's good uh tropical beach is probably one of my most memorable favorite cards but it's the trainer so that feels weird but i love tropical beach mine is very similar to will's it was darkrai gx or was it the darkrai ex it was from the dark explorers darkrai and its ability was the as long as it had a dark type energy you have free retreat um and it was darkrai was part of the mewtwo wars in the black and white era which is part of the celebrations uh the mewtwo with the i think it's xball it's like a double colorless so you would play a double colorless it would do 40 but it would do 80 against another mewtwo but they would play it and so it was it was the dark cry there um is this the junk hunt sable eye does it have junk hunt on it yes it has junk this artwork is incredible yes isn't it and it's a great it is incredible because junk hunt should be free right there's no energy cost for junk hunt i don't know it's got a dark thing next to it no one dark energy no is it a dark energy i thought it was free nah look i don't know what that is one dark energy wonder oh yeah it is a dark energy yeah yeah because you you get there are there are some pokemon cards that have like a free move and it's usually like an empty circle those are the only that's free those are actually i think i have some ancient pokemon cards in my basement from like when it was first released i haven't looked i haven't looked for them so my favorite meme tcg card and now i you have to forgive me because i can't remember if it was palkia or dialga but it's basically it was one where it would like attack and then immediately go back to the bench after it was done attacking and then no no no no no no kel deal was rush in oh yeah kelly was rushing yeah yeah this was it would attack and immediately go back to the bench and then there was another card that was playable at the time that was like could not take attacks from pokemon gx which like everybody had gx was like usually there was a hoopa that happens this is way way way before hoopa um so it was just like you would attack with palkia put it back to the bench and then the other one would come up yeah and then they couldn't they couldn't attack it and then you just like you keep swapping palki or dialga in it it's like so me me and stupid but i love it there was an assault a selgor card that did the same thing and that's attack i think was called deck and cover and then for two double colorless it would well no no no then it would go back it would go back into the deck the deck yeah yeah yeah and then but then you could use mu and you could copy that move yes so you could do the same thing you'd use gardevoir to thin your deck out but make sure that you didn't deck out so yeah cover was a good deck yeah but uh there needed a lot of pieces new to tropical beach so i love the tropical beach i do like the keldeo with russian calder russian was was very memorable too blastoise keldeo yeah yeah those were the good old days after matalia cards over here i could show again that's that's not not going to win you any games but what is our pokemon of the week well i screwed up i don't remember the last one so the last one i gave you five irrelevant i gotta i gotta open it up again uh five non-relevant facts one was about going to the gym one was about the jetsons one was about the roman god janus one was about a german word that was probably the most important of the clues that people ignored uh and then one was about reciprocating motion all right so if number one means that it's only a steel type so mono steel type number two references sprockets and cogs oh i remember that number three references something that has two faces number four i'm not going to tell you and number five is a method of using two sprockets together so that you would transform motion that goes up and down or in and out into rotational motion what then would you say cling clang [Music] craig you got to guess something clang greg is correct because there's no word in german that is cling clang there is a word in german that is clong tone musical tone note or timbre yeah greg hates uh mechanical pokemon i do i mean that doesn't mean he can't get the answer right i know guy what i like cling cling i like that line i do too you find him in charge stone cavern along with all the dynamos some of the best pokemon was amazing was the last non-legendary or mythical pokemon from generation five to make its debut in a main series what does that mean oh what i see what they're saying they're saying when you're going through the world clang is the last pokemon that's like a new pokemon that you can encounter in the wild in generation five how is that possible i don't think you even see buffalo until you're on victory road yeah or near victory road because you've already seen them so because somebody's already used them in a in the party somebody's already throwing them out yeah but you see clang in charge stone cavern which is halfway through the game it's not not even to twist mountain yet bulbapedia oh are they saying it was the like are they saying that it was the last pokemon to be shown like you didn't know it existed because we saw buffalo in like early previews i don't know this sentence that's real while or accurate i can't parse this sentence like there's so many ways it could go anyways the shuffle icon is just in itself and it's fine uh it's shiny as good it's like a copper that's steam punky coppery yeah if you like that sort of thing all right are you ready for this week's pokemon yeah ready i i messed up big time but y'all in whatever eight years of doing this i'm allowed to make a mistake once i reference the error in the clue i'm also made it extremely short because i'm tired of greg's complaints even when i'm not here complaining about me and my clues i was just giving help here is the clue i appreciate bobby appreciating me thank you bobby this recently featured repeat from two months ago pokemon which steve thinks is so powerful that it warped the rules of a competition also falls in line with the trend started to pokemon ago oh boy that's a good one except it's a repeat oh man two months ago i forgot to check my
