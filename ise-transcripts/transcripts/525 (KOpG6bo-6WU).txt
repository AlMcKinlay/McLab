accredited institution (1:24 - 1:28)
what's the easter i think it's eastern (1:30 - 1:34)
states is our accrediting like if only (1:31 - 1:36)
you had fallen into that realm (1:34 - 1:39)
what are you getting your degree in (1:36 - 1:42)
cognitive neuroscience my favorite (1:39 - 1:44)
all right we're having a cognitive (1:42 - 1:47)
neuroscience episode this week let's (1:44 - 1:49)
talk about neurons brain areas and the (1:47 - 1:52)
way that language is formed (1:49 - 1:55)
let's go into broca's area and pokemon (1:52 - 1:55)
great (1:55 - 1:58)
[Laughter] (1:55 - 2:01)
steve just checked out again (1:58 - 2:02)
you just have to listen to us talk about (2:01 - 2:04)
yarn for like 10 minutes before finally (2:02 - 2:06)
starting the podcast and we've already (2:04 - 2:07)
derailed it and now we're going to talk (2:06 - 2:10)
about neuroscience (2:07 - 2:12)
fantastic neuroscientists (2:10 - 2:14)
great (2:12 - 2:15)
the long con of the show is to get a (2:14 - 2:17)
bunch of people smarter than me to then (2:15 - 2:19)
just replace me (2:17 - 2:21)
and then the show is nothing of but (2:19 - 2:24)
doctors and and (2:21 - 2:26)
highly educated people talking about (2:24 - 2:27)
pokemon (2:26 - 2:29)
correct (2:27 - 2:30)
that's not me (2:29 - 2:33)
but we do have pokemon news uh there was (2:30 - 2:37)
a big 20 minute pokemon presents that (2:33 - 2:39)
happened on wednesday (2:37 - 2:42)
uh it had a bunch of mobile games (2:39 - 2:43)
um and then it had a (2:42 - 2:46)
i think it was like nine minutes of (2:43 - 2:48)
scarlet and violet (2:46 - 2:50)
and we're gonna do the non-traditional (2:48 - 2:51)
approach here we're going to start the (2:50 - 2:53)
scarlet violet stuff first and then (2:51 - 2:54)
we'll save all the (2:53 - 2:57)
smaller stuff for afterwards there's a (2:54 - 2:58)
lot to go through that's kind of why i (2:57 - 3:00)
was like let's just do it first just in (2:58 - 3:03)
case the show runs prolonged (3:00 - 3:06)
um so (3:03 - 3:08)
gosh where do where do we start i guess (3:06 - 3:09)
well i guess we'll go through the press (3:08 - 3:11)
release the press release will take us (3:09 - 3:12)
because (3:11 - 3:14)
it's a good guide yes (3:12 - 3:15)
um (3:14 - 3:18)
so it says welcome to pal daya i think (3:15 - 3:21)
i'm saying that right (3:18 - 3:21)
i (3:21 - 3:24)
believe i'm saying that i'm so (3:22 - 3:26)
disappointed that is not the name that i (3:24 - 3:29)
gave to this region (3:26 - 3:30)
players will start their adventure in (3:29 - 3:33)
the paldea region a land of vast open (3:30 - 3:36)
spaces dotted with lakes towering peaks (3:33 - 3:38)
wastelands and mountain ranges (3:36 - 3:40)
players will find a lot of people and (3:38 - 3:42)
pokemon living in a variety of locations (3:40 - 3:45)
ranging from a farming village with (3:42 - 3:47)
bountiful harvest to a port town with a (3:45 - 3:50)
bustling market there are also pokemon (3:47 - 3:51)
living on treetops rivers and other (3:50 - 3:53)
locations in the wilderness (3:51 - 3:55)
in the center of the palace in the (3:53 - 3:58)
center of paldeya sits the largest city (3:55 - 4:00)
i actually didn't see anyone talk about (3:58 - 4:02)
this maybe because no one reads the (4:00 - 4:03)
press release and they didn't even talk (4:02 - 4:05)
about in the trailer but it's called uh (4:03 - 4:07)
mesagosa (4:05 - 4:09)
uh it is here where players will either (4:07 - 4:12)
find the nargi (4:09 - 4:14)
nara (4:12 - 4:16)
academy which i think is spanish for (4:14 - 4:18)
on huh yes (4:16 - 4:22)
yeah perfect i like no no (4:18 - 4:22)
okay (4:23 - 4:27)
rolls off the tongue (4:25 - 4:29)
i just said it twice naranja come on (4:27 - 4:31)
it's not that hard (4:29 - 4:33)
then uva (4:31 - 4:35)
so it's (4:33 - 4:36)
the (4:35 - 4:39)
nara is orange right and then (4:36 - 4:42)
uva is grape yes you can you can do it (4:39 - 4:45)
not ron ha although nobody says r except (4:42 - 4:49)
for english speakers (4:45 - 4:49)
there you go (4:50 - 4:52)
in pokemon (4:52 - 4:56)
scarlet and violet the name of the (4:54 - 4:59)
schools its emblem and its uniforms and (4:56 - 5:02)
other details will differ depending on (4:59 - 5:04)
which version of the game is played (5:02 - 5:06)
the pokedex will also be loaded on the (5:04 - 5:10)
rotom phone as an app classic copy and (5:06 - 5:11)
paste we don't even get a new road time (5:10 - 5:14)
they're just giving us the phone again (5:11 - 5:16)
players will able to see the entire map (5:14 - 5:18)
of the paldea region (5:16 - 5:20)
in the map app (5:18 - 5:22)
which will also show their current (5:20 - 5:23)
location i love (5:22 - 5:25)
i love how this is like a sentence (5:23 - 5:27)
because this was such a huge complaint (5:25 - 5:29)
in certain shields like there is no map (5:27 - 5:32)
and i don't know where i am in this map (5:29 - 5:34)
um players will also see all kinds of (5:32 - 5:36)
information like nearby towns pokemon (5:34 - 5:39)
centers and wild pokemon (5:36 - 5:41)
okay that's the first part of the press (5:39 - 5:45)
release so i guess we'll start there (5:41 - 5:48)
um (5:45 - 5:48)
the the world looks cool it's very (5:48 - 5:52)
colorful compared to legends and it does (5:50 - 5:55)
give me legends vibes of you know the (5:52 - 5:56)
panning over the camera and seeing the (5:55 - 5:59)
pokemon in the area um (5:56 - 6:01)
but i would love to hear your guys's (5:59 - 6:02)
thoughts (6:01 - 6:04)
i do like the pretty colors a lot i feel (6:02 - 6:07)
like um like 90 of what sways me to get (6:04 - 6:09)
a game or not is like whether the colors (6:07 - 6:10)
are pretty and the colors in this game (6:09 - 6:13)
are very pretty so i'm a fan of that (6:10 - 6:16)
yeah i mean i think especially for (6:13 - 6:19)
the outside of town areas that you're (6:16 - 6:22)
gonna have that more (6:19 - 6:24)
i don't know if it's like more oil (6:22 - 6:27)
painting or more watercolor art style (6:24 - 6:30)
for your surroundings where (6:27 - 6:32)
you're not gonna get like sharp edges (6:30 - 6:33)
and things like that (6:32 - 6:36)
um but definitely you know bright colors (6:33 - 6:38)
and (6:36 - 6:38)
um (6:38 - 6:44)
i don't know it's more of like a mood (6:41 - 6:47)
how did you guys feel (6:44 - 6:48)
oh i was gonna say how did you guys feel (6:47 - 6:51)
about the guy narrating the uh (6:48 - 6:52)
um (6:51 - 6:54)
the (6:52 - 6:56)
trailer i guess is the name his name was (6:54 - 6:59)
uh clavel i think the academy the (6:56 - 7:03)
director of the academy club old (6:59 - 7:03)
i'm like so how does um (7:06 - 7:09)
do we know how this game works so it (7:08 - 7:11)
seems like you're like a student in a (7:09 - 7:12)
school and the reason that you're like (7:11 - 7:13)
exploring this region is for for (7:12 - 7:16)
homework is that correct well there's (7:13 - 7:19)
like there's the three stories right (7:16 - 7:22)
so that's that's one of the stories (7:19 - 7:24)
that's but it's the treasure hunt is (7:22 - 7:26)
your wait they actually said it in the (7:24 - 7:29)
trailer they said it's uh (7:26 - 7:32)
oh it's like like field study maybe is (7:29 - 7:33)
the term that they use something like (7:32 - 7:35)
that but independent study (7:33 - 7:39)
okay that's what it was (7:35 - 7:40)
i mean like that's (7:39 - 7:43)
they did say there are three stories (7:40 - 7:45)
which like i i like rolled my eyes (7:43 - 7:47)
because (7:45 - 7:47)
like (7:47 - 7:50)
i don't think it's actually three (7:48 - 7:52)
stories in the sense of like what we've (7:50 - 7:54)
already done in pokemon games right like (7:52 - 7:57)
you in in red and blue there you could (7:54 - 7:59)
argue that there are two stories one (7:57 - 8:00)
story is defeating team rocky and (7:59 - 8:02)
giovanni the air of the story is trying (8:00 - 8:04)
to be like champion (8:02 - 8:06)
and now just like literally apply that (8:04 - 8:09)
to every game so is this just (8:06 - 8:10)
they already said one of the stories (8:09 - 8:12)
becoming champion they said get eight (8:10 - 8:14)
gym badges that's they said that is a (8:12 - 8:15)
story (8:14 - 8:16)
it's like okay well that's in every (8:15 - 8:18)
pokemon game (8:16 - 8:20)
um and then another story they said is (8:18 - 8:22)
the treasure hunt (8:20 - 8:23)
uh which (8:22 - 8:26)
if is is that like figuring out what the (8:23 - 8:27)
thing in the middle of the map is (8:26 - 8:30)
because that's probably the most um uh (8:27 - 8:34)
ambiguous thing is this giant swirly (8:30 - 8:36)
middle of the map probably mythical (8:34 - 8:38)
slash legendary pokemon in there but (8:36 - 8:42)
isn't that also like if you look at (8:38 - 8:45)
sword and shield (8:42 - 8:45)
the credits roll you become champion (8:46 - 8:51)
you've defeated the bad guys and then (8:48 - 8:54)
there's another story of catching either (8:51 - 8:56)
zashin or zamasunta (8:54 - 8:58)
and then the story that's in literally (8:56 - 9:00)
every pokemon game is there's a bad guy (8:58 - 9:02)
team that has nothing to do with (9:00 - 9:03)
champions except for i guess black and (9:02 - 9:05)
white they kind of merge that (9:03 - 9:07)
defeat bad guys so is that the three (9:05 - 9:08)
stories that i just like name them all (9:07 - 9:10)
out or is the like (9:08 - 9:12)
the third story magically like rescue (9:10 - 9:15)
your mother who got captured (9:12 - 9:16)
so (9:15 - 9:18)
i think (9:16 - 9:21)
or like my take on it is i mean it is (9:18 - 9:23)
going to be very similar to those in (9:21 - 9:24)
those ways (9:23 - 9:25)
but (9:24 - 9:29)
you can like focus on one (9:25 - 9:33)
and the other ones don't won't interrupt (9:29 - 9:36)
right oh i see so like if i'm in x and y (9:33 - 9:38)
i could just get my eight gym badges and (9:36 - 9:40)
then battle pitbull and lysander like (9:38 - 9:44)
yes and mr worldwide you gotta you gotta (9:40 - 9:46)
wait (9:44 - 9:46)
i can't find the map where's the map (9:49 - 9:54)
is the is the director just the bad guy (9:52 - 9:57)
he like he gives like major bad guy (9:54 - 9:59)
vibes right clavel (9:57 - 10:00)
yeah (9:59 - 10:03)
oh man did you never read the madeline (10:00 - 10:06)
books excuse me it's the it's the bad (10:03 - 10:10)
hat is the bad guy no um (10:06 - 10:12)
oh my god i either just like (10:10 - 10:14)
really aged myself (10:12 - 10:15)
please tell me that somebody else has (10:14 - 10:17)
read the madeline books (10:15 - 10:20)
oh no you guys have to find them they're (10:17 - 10:22)
so good it's about these little girls (10:20 - 10:25)
that went to like a school in france (10:22 - 10:28)
um i think that the instructors are (10:25 - 10:33)
the bad guys and mr clavel is not (10:28 - 10:33)
i think a lot of people looked at rose (10:33 - 10:38)
and was like rose is the bad guy right (10:35 - 10:41)
like i thought that was like pretty (10:38 - 10:43)
so are they going to do it again like (10:41 - 10:45)
they they already did the the guy the (10:43 - 10:46)
the guy who's your friend the whole time (10:45 - 10:48)
turns out to be the bad guy like ooh (10:46 - 10:49)
plot twist do you think they're really (10:48 - 10:51)
gonna pull that one out two times in a (10:49 - 10:52)
row (10:51 - 10:54)
yeah because now you're not expecting it (10:52 - 10:55)
because you're like they'll never do it (10:54 - 10:58)
twice in a row (10:55 - 10:58)
um (11:03 - 11:06)
like (11:04 - 11:08)
lysander was like an obvious bad guy too (11:06 - 11:10)
right like the minute you see him you're (11:08 - 11:12)
like oh you're the bad guy but he's like (11:10 - 11:14)
he is friendly when you first meet him (11:12 - 11:16)
because he's like i invented the not (11:14 - 11:19)
road tom phone the what i don't remember (11:16 - 11:21)
what that was called (11:19 - 11:24)
the x receiver the scan receiver (11:21 - 11:26)
oh (11:24 - 11:27)
who's going to remember that which game (11:26 - 11:30)
was like the c gear is that that game no (11:27 - 11:33)
the c gear was like black and white that (11:30 - 11:33)
i do (11:33 - 11:37)
[Laughter] (11:33 - 11:39)
that was like a pretty good twist (11:37 - 11:41)
i guess that (11:39 - 11:43)
gets this was (11:41 - 11:46)
using n as like propaganda (11:43 - 11:48)
that was like pretty okay (11:46 - 11:50)
i mean they never explained the shadow (11:48 - 11:54)
triad stuff but ah details (11:50 - 11:54)
it was cylan chili and (11:55 - 12:00)
the other one (11:58 - 12:03)
who's the water one cress (12:00 - 12:05)
here greg's not here here's the thing (12:03 - 12:07)
that greg will say and i will agree with (12:05 - 12:09)
them and this is a thing like i i see on (12:07 - 12:10)
comments and stuff where it's where (12:09 - 12:12)
people will always be like pokemon (12:10 - 12:13)
stories (12:12 - 12:15)
people will always like pokemon story (12:13 - 12:17)
was good for black and white (12:15 - 12:19)
it really wasn't it was like very like (12:17 - 12:21)
all the pokemon story all the pokemon (12:19 - 12:23)
stories are like very average (12:21 - 12:25)
and (12:23 - 12:28)
the the pokemon world building is very (12:25 - 12:31)
good and the pokemon lore is very good (12:28 - 12:34)
like the in-depth that they go in with (12:31 - 12:35)
characters (12:34 - 12:38)
and like this the story like what we saw (12:35 - 12:39)
i'm getting a little ahead of ourselves (12:38 - 12:42)
but what we saw of uh what was their (12:39 - 12:44)
name what was their name their name was (12:42 - 12:46)
um (12:44 - 12:46)
grusha (12:46 - 12:50)
so they show grushta (12:48 - 12:53)
he is this gym leader they give him a (12:50 - 12:56)
lot of personality in in the trailer and (12:53 - 12:58)
then they say grusha used to be a (12:56 - 13:00)
professional snowboarder but now he's (12:58 - 13:03)
the gym leader of the glastado gym (13:00 - 13:05)
full-time he's a knife type specialist (13:03 - 13:07)
who uses (13:05 - 13:09)
c titan as his partner (13:07 - 13:10)
like that that is great (13:09 - 13:13)
building of a character you already get (13:10 - 13:14)
a little bit of lore that's all we're (13:13 - 13:15)
gonna get (13:14 - 13:18)
like they they never do more than what (13:15 - 13:21)
they just did right there and i i hope (13:18 - 13:22)
that they do (13:21 - 13:25)
but even even like a a character like (13:22 - 13:26)
valerie in (13:25 - 13:28)
x and y (13:26 - 13:29)
you're like they made a big deal because (13:28 - 13:31)
she's like the first fairy type gym (13:29 - 13:33)
leader you go to the town you see your (13:31 - 13:34)
gym her gym has like a bunch of like (13:33 - 13:36)
clothing um and (13:34 - 13:38)
sewing stuff (13:36 - 13:40)
but that's it like that that that's all (13:38 - 13:41)
there is like (13:40 - 13:43)
you don't really get anything more out (13:41 - 13:44)
of her (13:43 - 13:45)
um (13:44 - 13:46)
so they have they have all these pieces (13:45 - 13:47)
in place (13:46 - 13:50)
for like flushing out characters but (13:47 - 13:51)
then actually (13:50 - 13:54)
never really doing anything with them (13:51 - 13:56)
um (13:54 - 13:57)
another example before we move on would (13:56 - 14:00)
be like milo like they they gave us a (13:57 - 14:01)
bunch of trailers of milo they're like (14:00 - 14:03)
milo and nessa these are the two first (14:01 - 14:05)
gym leaders you'll experience (14:03 - 14:07)
and you do and you get to milo's gym and (14:05 - 14:09)
you battle milo and he's like chasing (14:07 - 14:11)
wulu and then you never no one ever (14:09 - 14:13)
mentions or talks about milo again he's (14:11 - 14:16)
just gone he's just he's like true when (14:13 - 14:17)
you're (14:16 - 14:20)
down and they they they are like (14:17 - 14:22)
dynamaxing all the gyms the pokemon in (14:20 - 14:25)
the gyms milo comes back (14:22 - 14:26)
yeah (14:25 - 14:27)
and you can be like buddies with milo (14:26 - 14:30)
with your all-star tournament thingy at (14:27 - 14:32)
the end that's true you could all start (14:30 - 14:34)
tournament with milo (14:32 - 14:36)
um (14:34 - 14:41)
yeah i the the three story thing is like (14:36 - 14:41)
i feel like it's just marketing (14:41 - 14:45)
yeah i would hope it would be more like (14:43 - 14:48)
will said um like more parallel than (14:45 - 14:49)
something like you know sword and shield (14:48 - 14:51)
like getting being champion and then (14:49 - 14:53)
afterwards getting your legendary doggo (14:51 - 14:56)
um because since they're making it open (14:53 - 14:57)
world and they're saying that you don't (14:56 - 14:59)
have to do all of the gyms in like the (14:57 - 15:02)
same order um it seems or i would hope (14:59 - 15:03)
that that means you have more (15:02 - 15:05)
flexibility to kind of like choose your (15:03 - 15:07)
own adventure and um (15:05 - 15:09)
not have to do the (15:07 - 15:11)
story that they want you to do in (15:09 - 15:14)
whatever order (15:11 - 15:14)
i also think it might lead to (15:15 - 15:18)
like (15:17 - 15:21)
if you want to focus on collecting then (15:18 - 15:23)
you can do that and feel satisfied that (15:21 - 15:26)
you like my most optimistic viewpoint (15:23 - 15:27)
would be like (15:26 - 15:29)
you can focus on collecting (15:27 - 15:31)
and not have to worry about battling at (15:29 - 15:32)
all (15:31 - 15:35)
and you can still be very satisfied with (15:32 - 15:37)
what you get out of the story or if it's (15:35 - 15:38)
the other way it's like you can focus on (15:37 - 15:41)
battling and not worry about collecting (15:38 - 15:42)
and still be very happy with what you (15:41 - 15:44)
get out of the story (15:42 - 15:46)
yeah maybe it'll be like pogo where they (15:44 - 15:47)
like let you choose which research path (15:46 - 15:49)
you want to go down except for you get (15:47 - 15:50)
to do all of them you don't have to (15:49 - 15:52)
restrict yourself to one (15:50 - 15:55)
and that could be another like third (15:52 - 15:58)
story is like completing your pokedex (15:55 - 15:59)
right so you have (15:58 - 16:02)
become champion we know that for sure (15:59 - 16:05)
probably defeat bad guys um or bad (16:02 - 16:07)
organization uh complete pokedex and (16:05 - 16:09)
then the last one would be that treasure (16:07 - 16:12)
hunt but the treasure hunt could be (16:09 - 16:14)
defeat bad guys slash that part of the (16:12 - 16:16)
story as well (16:14 - 16:17)
that's my suspicion (16:16 - 16:19)
yeah like completing the pokedex is (16:17 - 16:22)
probably the third story (16:19 - 16:24)
they did show new people they showed uh (16:22 - 16:26)
clavel he acts as the director of the (16:24 - 16:28)
academy will teach the player many (16:26 - 16:30)
things about their school (16:28 - 16:31)
jacques (16:30 - 16:34)
which is not that's a french name we're (16:31 - 16:36)
in a spanish region well how is it (16:34 - 16:37)
spelled (16:36 - 16:42)
to spain uh that is also true j-a-c-q (16:37 - 16:42)
yeah that's like halfway between both of (16:43 - 16:48)
them yeah that's that's strange i dig (16:45 - 16:49)
his purple haircut though (16:48 - 16:51)
mr jacques is very knowledgeable about (16:49 - 16:54)
pokemon biology and is the developer of (16:51 - 16:57)
the pokedex app for the rotom phone he (16:54 - 17:01)
is also the player's homeroom teacher (16:57 - 17:03)
arvern (17:01 - 17:05)
is the upperclassman of the academy he's (17:03 - 17:07)
good at cooking and researching healthy (17:05 - 17:09)
recipes that can help pokemon feel (17:07 - 17:11)
better (17:09 - 17:13)
cooking penny (17:11 - 17:16)
it has a shy personality and for some (17:13 - 17:18)
reason she doesn't come to the academy (17:16 - 17:20)
very often (17:18 - 17:21)
she's my favorite (17:20 - 17:23)
and then we then we already talked about (17:21 - 17:25)
grusha (17:23 - 17:26)
which (17:25 - 17:29)
i watched a lot of people's reactions (17:26 - 17:32)
to grusha and everyone was like she is (17:29 - 17:34)
great i said the same thing i was like i (17:32 - 17:35)
love her. (17:34 - 17:37)
and then we all find out later that she (17:35 - 17:39)
is a he (17:37 - 17:42)
so my bad for misgendering but uh at (17:39 - 17:44)
least i felt a little less bad that (17:42 - 17:46)
everyone did literally the same thing as (17:44 - 17:47)
me (17:46 - 17:49)
uh but grecia is great (17:47 - 17:52)
uh grecia seems awesome (17:49 - 17:55)
and it is cool that i don't know if it's (17:52 - 17:56)
on purpose but you would like to think (17:55 - 17:58)
it's on purpose that you know they made (17:56 - 18:01)
a more feminine (17:58 - 18:03)
character (18:01 - 18:04)
uh (18:03 - 18:05)
they've done this (18:04 - 18:08)
they've they've (18:05 - 18:11)
done something like this before (18:08 - 18:13)
in x and y wow i'm talking about x and y (18:11 - 18:15)
a lot (18:13 - 18:17)
uh (18:15 - 18:17)
so (18:18 - 18:21)
they they actually (18:20 - 18:23)
did a trans character in x and y i don't (18:21 - 18:25)
know if you guys know this (18:23 - 18:27)
but um (18:25 - 18:28)
they (18:27 - 18:30)
slightly changed it and well they didn't (18:28 - 18:31)
slightly they they straight up changed (18:30 - 18:33)
it in the english version of the games (18:31 - 18:35)
but um you do you know how like pokemon (18:33 - 18:37)
games have like set characters like (18:35 - 18:39)
beauty there's always like a beauty (18:37 - 18:40)
there's always like a karate master (18:39 - 18:42)
there's always like a pokey maniac and (18:40 - 18:43)
the pokemaniac in this game is really (18:42 - 18:45)
cool he's like a (18:43 - 18:46)
stuffed (18:45 - 18:48)
pokey plush vest (18:46 - 18:50)
um but they (18:48 - 18:52)
uh (18:50 - 18:54)
long story short in the (18:52 - 18:56)
battle (18:54 - 18:59)
meson the like cafe area the (18:56 - 19:01)
battle that's the cafe yeah the battle (18:59 - 19:05)
maison um there's a character that uh (19:01 - 19:07)
when you battle her (19:05 - 19:09)
she she says like i used to be a black (19:07 - 19:11)
belt a couple years ago isn't the power (19:09 - 19:13)
of science amazing (19:11 - 19:15)
um (19:13 - 19:17)
and then in the japanese one it like (19:15 - 19:20)
actually talks about like the transition (19:17 - 19:22)
a little bit more clear i don't know why (19:20 - 19:24)
i do know why actually america censored (19:22 - 19:27)
it because like they have the weirdest (19:24 - 19:30)
it's fine but anyways (19:27 - 19:33)
it's not fine but it's also we can't do (19:30 - 19:35)
anything about the past now right like (19:33 - 19:38)
it's like a 10 year old games exactly (19:35 - 19:40)
what can we do at this point um besides (19:38 - 19:42)
like acknowledge that at least they (19:40 - 19:44)
tried (19:42 - 19:46)
so we don't we don't know the full story (19:44 - 19:49)
of grusha but uh grusha is a he and they (19:46 - 19:52)
do look very feminine and that's okay i (19:49 - 19:55)
think that's very cool it kind of falls (19:52 - 19:57)
in the same line as uh (19:55 - 19:59)
i i hated that character so much i (19:57 - 20:02)
refuse to learn its name bleeble bleeb (19:59 - 20:03)
from (20:02 - 20:05)
sword and shield (20:03 - 20:05)
the little the little blonde kid (20:06 - 20:09)
yeah yeah (20:08 - 20:11)
i forget his name too (20:09 - 20:13)
because he's just so annoying the (20:11 - 20:14)
annoying you're like (20:13 - 20:16)
you like beat him and he gets really mad (20:14 - 20:18)
and then he gets like scooped up by opal (20:16 - 20:21)
and he got the oh bead that's what i (20:18 - 20:22)
said (20:21 - 20:24)
but i like bleeble (20:22 - 20:27)
when when b first appeared (20:24 - 20:31)
i was thinking like a weeble character (20:27 - 20:31)
so when b first appeared i was like (20:32 - 20:37)
that's a girl (20:36 - 20:39)
oh you know you're right there were (20:37 - 20:41)
people that thought that yeah (20:39 - 20:44)
and then you're like oh no it's just a (20:41 - 20:46)
dude who likes to wear pink that's cool (20:44 - 20:48)
no he like to wear (20:46 - 20:49)
he did whatever you're right now he (20:48 - 20:50)
liked pink (20:49 - 20:52)
which was (20:50 - 20:55)
opal liked pink on other people but (20:52 - 20:56)
opal's favorite color was purple (20:55 - 20:57)
something (20:56 - 21:00)
it was a trick question at the quiz (20:57 - 21:01)
so we have like these characters that (21:00 - 21:02)
are like feminine (21:01 - 21:05)
keys are there any like (21:02 - 21:08)
masculine cheese uh wasn't (21:05 - 21:10)
i i could be i i could be completely (21:08 - 21:12)
wrong but wasn't the character in (21:10 - 21:14)
legends like that (21:12 - 21:15)
the (21:14 - 21:17)
the (21:15 - 21:18)
she was like in charge of the dojo in (21:17 - 21:21)
the back (21:18 - 21:21)
i can't remember her name though like (21:21 - 21:25)
the head of the guards (21:23 - 21:27)
i think she had red hair i think she was (21:25 - 21:29)
supposed to be based on flint (21:27 - 21:31)
but i can't remember her name (21:29 - 21:32)
they really flushed out the characters (21:31 - 21:33)
in (21:32 - 21:35)
[Laughter] (21:33 - 21:37)
legends (21:35 - 21:38)
oh you know i did want to bring up (21:37 - 21:42)
legends because uh uh (21:38 - 21:42)
pengu said they they were not interested (21:42 - 21:47)
based on everything they saw up to the (21:45 - 21:51)
trailers and then the game came out (21:47 - 21:52)
and then did you skip it or did you get (21:51 - 21:53)
it (21:52 - 21:55)
okay so i watched everyone play it and (21:53 - 21:57)
it looked like everyone was having a lot (21:55 - 21:59)
of fun playing it and i believed that it (21:57 - 22:01)
was a good game but i was also like this (21:59 - 22:02)
still doesn't look like the kind of game (22:01 - 22:04)
that i would want to play so i held off (22:02 - 22:06)
but then my big brother got the game so (22:04 - 22:09)
i stole his cartridge and started a save (22:06 - 22:12)
file and i made it like two hours in um (22:09 - 22:15)
but it didn't really stick (22:12 - 22:17)
was it the the catching mechanic that (22:15 - 22:18)
turned you off (22:17 - 22:20)
that and i'm just like i'm bad at video (22:18 - 22:22)
games so i'm like i don't (22:20 - 22:24)
i don't know where to go i keep i'm also (22:22 - 22:27)
like very bad at at navigating like in (22:24 - 22:30)
the real world and also in games so as (22:27 - 22:31)
soon as you take away the train tracks i (22:30 - 22:33)
know it's like unpopular opinion (22:31 - 22:34)
everyone wants open world like (22:33 - 22:35)
everything but as soon as you take away (22:34 - 22:36)
the train tracks i'm like i don't know (22:35 - 22:38)
what to do i don't know where to go i'm (22:36 - 22:39)
just gonna get lost and i end up (22:38 - 22:41)
spending like hours circling the same (22:39 - 22:44)
place which ends up not being fun um (22:41 - 22:45)
like when i played breath of the wild i (22:44 - 22:47)
also got like two hours in and i never (22:45 - 22:48)
made it off the cliff with like your (22:47 - 22:50)
paraglider because i couldn't figure out (22:48 - 22:52)
like how to navigate to the thing and i (22:50 - 22:53)
ended up just cooking for like an hour (22:52 - 22:55)
and then giving up on the game (22:53 - 22:57)
that sounds like me with most zelda (22:55 - 22:59)
games (22:57 - 23:00)
so are you worried about that scarlet (22:59 - 23:02)
and violet following (23:00 - 23:04)
more of us (23:02 - 23:06)
more similarities than legends versus (23:04 - 23:10)
maybe sword and shield yeah i mean i i (23:06 - 23:11)
think it's great that like pokemon is (23:10 - 23:13)
branching out with and like moving away (23:11 - 23:15)
from the train tracks because i think (23:13 - 23:17)
that's what you know your average person (23:15 - 23:19)
is has been screaming for for however (23:17 - 23:21)
long um and i'm gonna get the games i'm (23:19 - 23:22)
gonna try it um (23:21 - 23:23)
so (23:22 - 23:26)
i don't know we'll see (23:23 - 23:26)
yeah i know like (23:26 - 23:29)
i i think with open world games (23:30 - 23:34)
i i had this problem with final fantasy (23:32 - 23:36)
15 where it was like i want to do this i (23:34 - 23:37)
want to do that and then (23:36 - 23:40)
like the this and that weren't that (23:37 - 23:41)
interesting and then i could tell my (23:40 - 23:44)
enjoyment started to fade which i would (23:41 - 23:45)
imagine that other people have similar (23:44 - 23:47)
experiences (23:45 - 23:49)
but at least final fantasy xv and i (23:47 - 23:52)
would say legends (23:49 - 23:54)
did have it where it was like you can (23:52 - 23:55)
kind of ignore all that and like here's (23:54 - 23:57)
your next story mission here's your next (23:55 - 23:58)
story mission here's your next story (23:57 - 24:00)
mission um and kind of and kind of go to (23:58 - 24:02)
that i guess the difference though with (24:00 - 24:03)
like (24:02 - 24:05)
legends as you could (24:03 - 24:08)
not have the resources or the the (24:05 - 24:10)
correct pokemon to (24:08 - 24:13)
move forward so you would have to like (24:10 - 24:15)
fiddle around the area (24:13 - 24:19)
um it's like a tough balance um and it's (24:15 - 24:21)
funny because like when i (24:19 - 24:24)
when i was like playing elden ring (24:21 - 24:26)
i was like sometimes i just like when (24:24 - 24:27)
games are linear and i know that's an (24:26 - 24:29)
unpopular opinion but like when i'm in a (24:27 - 24:30)
cave (24:29 - 24:32)
in elden ring and it's like you could go (24:30 - 24:34)
left or you could go right and my (24:32 - 24:36)
thought process is well one's a dead end (24:34 - 24:38)
and the other one is the right way but (24:36 - 24:41)
if i go the right way first (24:38 - 24:43)
then i don't know what's at the dead end (24:41 - 24:44)
and then i'm backtracking because it's (24:43 - 24:46)
like oh this is the right way i need to (24:44 - 24:47)
go now the other way to figure out (24:46 - 24:49)
what's in the dead end oh the dead (24:47 - 24:52)
exactly the same way yeah so i like (24:49 - 24:53)
yeah when i'm like going along train (24:52 - 24:55)
tracks and i'm like i think this is the (24:53 - 24:56)
wrong way but i need to go the wrong way (24:55 - 24:58)
first to make sure that i see everything (24:56 - 24:59)
in the wrong way before i go the right (24:58 - 25:01)
way but i kind of just don't want that i (24:59 - 25:02)
just (25:01 - 25:04)
i just (25:02 - 25:05)
i get there's like it's like a sense of (25:04 - 25:07)
exploring but like not really it's more (25:05 - 25:10)
like a sense of anxiety of like i i i (25:07 - 25:12)
picked the right way and now i have to (25:10 - 25:14)
backtrack and go the wrong way because (25:12 - 25:16)
what if i miss something and then you (25:14 - 25:17)
get over there and you're like oh it's (25:16 - 25:20)
just a potion (25:17 - 25:22)
but you gotta cover all the territory (25:20 - 25:25)
uh yeah (25:22 - 25:25)
some sometimes like sometimes linear is (25:26 - 25:29)
good just get push me in the right (25:28 - 25:31)
direction just yeah don't give me like (25:29 - 25:33)
eight options i'm just well i want to go (25:31 - 25:35)
straight yeah when i'm playing video (25:33 - 25:36)
games it's because i'm tired of making (25:35 - 25:37)
decisions in the real world i just want (25:36 - 25:38)
to sit back and let somebody else make (25:37 - 25:40)
decisions for me (25:38 - 25:43)
um (25:40 - 25:43)
probably bring up a lot of comparisons (25:45 - 25:49)
to sword shield because uh you know (25:46 - 25:51)
there was the there was the (25:49 - 25:53)
how and hop both have three letters they (25:51 - 25:55)
both start with h they you know copy and (25:53 - 25:57)
paste animations (25:55 - 25:58)
it's fine i'm not here to debate copy (25:57 - 26:00)
pasting animations disney does it all (25:58 - 26:02)
the time (26:00 - 26:02)
uh (26:02 - 26:05)
but that was a very common uh talking (26:02 - 26:07)
point of like (26:05 - 26:09)
how is hop different than (26:07 - 26:10)
how (26:09 - 26:12)
and they did end up being very different (26:10 - 26:13)
characters (26:12 - 26:15)
um (26:13 - 26:16)
although (26:15 - 26:19)
i look at penny and they say she's a bit (26:16 - 26:20)
shy and for some reason she doesn't come (26:19 - 26:23)
around the academy and that does i can't (26:20 - 26:26)
help but think of marnie who (26:23 - 26:29)
i wouldn't maybe say marnie was shy (26:26 - 26:31)
no barney was a champion (26:29 - 26:33)
she did keep to herself (26:31 - 26:35)
and she thought that was more that like (26:33 - 26:37)
not that she was shy but that she was (26:35 - 26:39)
like i (26:37 - 26:41)
don't need you guys i am very (26:39 - 26:43)
self-sufficient and good at things and (26:41 - 26:45)
um like that kind of vibe rather than (26:43 - 26:47)
being shy (26:45 - 26:48)
yeah (26:47 - 26:50)
i mean her also her gimmick was like she (26:48 - 26:52)
didn't smile and then like at the very (26:50 - 26:54)
end it's like oh you gotta smile at him (26:52 - 26:55)
great (26:54 - 26:58)
great storytelling right no no not (26:55 - 26:59)
really (26:58 - 27:02)
it was cute (26:59 - 27:04)
um (27:02 - 27:05)
she has that like eevee plush wrapped (27:04 - 27:07)
around her (27:05 - 27:10)
uh what eevee plush it's like an eevee (27:07 - 27:12)
backpack she has a backpack and she just (27:10 - 27:14)
puts the arms (27:12 - 27:16)
down it's like an eevee backpack (27:14 - 27:18)
it's like a it's like the like gengar (27:16 - 27:21)
backpacking here from pokemon center (27:18 - 27:23)
it's like a plush but also gengar opens (27:21 - 27:25)
up and stuff inside him talking about a (27:23 - 27:27)
future product tie-in is what we're (27:25 - 27:29)
talking about here correct there's no (27:27 - 27:31)
way that this doesn't become a 80 (27:29 - 27:33)
backpack in only the japanese pokemon (27:31 - 27:35)
center (27:33 - 27:37)
[Applause] (27:35 - 27:39)
they didn't they dare to pack like that (27:37 - 27:40)
though that thing would just slide right (27:39 - 27:41)
off (27:40 - 27:44)
i think most of marnie's (27:41 - 27:47)
stuff actually became real and was japan (27:44 - 27:49)
exclusive like they had like her (27:47 - 27:50)
they had like her cell phone case her (27:49 - 27:52)
backpack her towel (27:50 - 27:53)
cheer towels i don't know what they're (27:52 - 27:56)
called but they're like towels (27:53 - 27:57)
i don't think a lot of that stuff came (27:56 - 28:00)
to the united states but they they made (27:57 - 28:01)
a big deal about (28:00 - 28:04)
that stuff (28:01 - 28:05)
um (28:04 - 28:06)
does this mean we're getting a new (28:05 - 28:08)
eeveelution because penny's got the (28:06 - 28:10)
eevee backpack (28:08 - 28:12)
yeah yes did you know there's a (28:10 - 28:14)
dedicated ev twitter that's existed for (28:12 - 28:17)
like seven years that has to mean we're (28:14 - 28:20)
getting a new he that's the long gun (28:17 - 28:23)
uh arvin (28:20 - 28:25)
is an upperclassman at the academy he's (28:23 - 28:28)
good at cooking (28:25 - 28:30)
healthy recipes that can help pokemon (28:28 - 28:31)
feel better (28:30 - 28:34)

high school varsity jacket feels from (28:41 - 28:45)
this dude (28:43 - 28:47)

he looks like a popular kid (28:47 - 28:50)
yes (28:49 - 28:51)
i agree (28:50 - 28:52)
he (28:51 - 28:57)
reminds me of the guy in legends arceus (28:52 - 29:00)
who was always like showing up and he's (28:57 - 29:02)
like part of the traitors guild or (29:00 - 29:04)
whatever and he was like oh i've got (29:02 - 29:06)
this other mission i'm going to lead you (29:04 - 29:08)
over here (29:06 - 29:11)
what was that dude's name the blonde guy (29:08 - 29:14)
the cynthia looking guy (29:11 - 29:14)
volo (29:15 - 29:20)
volo that's the vibe i got off (29:16 - 29:22)
this dude arvin (29:20 - 29:22)
uh there's a little bit more uh (29:23 - 29:27)
there's an extra sentence not on the (29:25 - 29:28)
press release i don't know why but (29:27 - 29:30)
that's on pokemon.com (29:28 - 29:32)
he will be asking you to help him out (29:30 - 29:34)
since he isn't very good at pokemon (29:32 - 29:37)
battles (29:34 - 29:37)
so he's the mpc who's going to send you (29:39 - 29:44)
out on missions to fight pokemon because (29:41 - 29:46)
this is very monster hunter vibe that's (29:44 - 29:48)
like 90 of the missions in monster (29:46 - 29:50)
hunter are i came across this monster i (29:48 - 29:52)
don't want to battle it myself you go do (29:50 - 29:55)
it (29:52 - 29:56)
um (29:55 - 29:58)
i'm gonna reread pennies real quick (29:56 - 30:00)
penny is in the same grade as you (29:58 - 30:02)
she's a bit of a shy personality and for (30:00 - 30:03)
some reason she doesn't come to the eve (30:02 - 30:05)
academy very often (30:03 - 30:07)
she's especially fond of her fluffy (30:05 - 30:11)
eevee bag and always has it on her back (30:07 - 30:11)
she's hiding something (30:11 - 30:15)
she looks sad she does (30:13 - 30:17)
also did you notice her leggings are (30:15 - 30:20)
like all patched (30:17 - 30:21)
is that patches or is that like the (30:20 - 30:23)
pattern on it (30:21 - 30:24)
like is that not possible and minus (30:23 - 30:26)
patterns (30:24 - 30:28)
i mean it's a plus i mean it's plus (30:26 - 30:31)
minus patterns but like the minus is the (30:28 - 30:32)
minus of the blue and the plus is the (30:31 - 30:35)
red and the it looks to our hair is blue (30:32 - 30:37)
and red where can i find a transparent (30:35 - 30:39)
skirt what is that where where where did (30:37 - 30:41)
the where does this clothing exist (30:39 - 30:43)
is it made out of plastic (30:41 - 30:45)
that would be the only way right rag (30:43 - 30:47)
stock go to rag stock no it's lace it's (30:45 - 30:49)
it's oh it's like a lace that's really (30:47 - 30:52)
hard to like a sheer fabric yeah yeah (30:49 - 30:54)
like a tool on my she has leggings (30:52 - 30:58)
shorts skirt a hoodie combat boots a (30:54 - 31:00)
huge backpack (30:58 - 31:02)
good luck (31:00 - 31:03)
all over the (31:02 - 31:04)
place (31:03 - 31:08)
she is 100 my aesthetic (31:04 - 31:09)
absolutely (31:08 - 31:10)
i wonder if she'll have some sort of (31:09 - 31:12)
like um (31:10 - 31:14)
not like (31:12 - 31:16)
not bipolar but like multiple i don't (31:14 - 31:18)
know multiple personality type thing (31:16 - 31:19)
because she has like the red and the (31:18 - 31:20)
blue hair and like the plus and the (31:19 - 31:22)
minus maybe there's something like split (31:20 - 31:24)
personality about her (31:22 - 31:25)
that we'll find out about (31:24 - 31:28)
when it says she doesn't come around to (31:25 - 31:30)
the academy very often i think and then (31:28 - 31:32)
she's sad this is maybe the american in (31:30 - 31:34)
me i just think like oh her parents are (31:32 - 31:36)
the problem like whether they're like (31:34 - 31:39)
getting divorced or they're they're not (31:36 - 31:41)
great parents like (31:39 - 31:45)
a popular theme in pokemon games (31:41 - 31:45)
i sure like that's like a popular theme (31:46 - 31:50)
in real life like oh this kid is very (31:47 - 31:51)
depressed must have problems at home (31:50 - 31:54)
kind of thing (31:51 - 31:55)
like (31:54 - 31:58)
it's like sucks to say but like (31:55 - 32:01)
that was like kind of the the trope irl (31:58 - 32:04)
in school when you're like (32:01 - 32:07)
they're not doing too hot (32:04 - 32:07)
um (32:09 - 32:11)
i mean it's just guaranteed she's hiding (32:11 - 32:16)
something we don't know what but at some (32:13 - 32:18)
point we're going to discover what it is (32:16 - 32:20)
what if the treasure's just been in her (32:18 - 32:22)
backpack the entire time no it's a new (32:20 - 32:25)
eeveelution that she like her eevee at (32:22 - 32:28)
home evolved into it and she can't let (32:25 - 32:29)
anybody know because she's the only one (32:28 - 32:31)
who's ever come across the ghost type (32:29 - 32:34)
eevee i don't think so i think i think (32:31 - 32:36)
what is going to happen is she is going (32:34 - 32:38)
to have an eevee and it's just every (32:36 - 32:39)
time you battle it it's going to have a (32:38 - 32:42)
different (32:39 - 32:42)
gosh i hate this word (32:42 - 32:46)
terrastilization (32:44 - 32:49)
yes correct i think that is her gimmick (32:46 - 32:51)
you will battle the eevee and she will (32:49 - 32:53)
have a different terrace (32:51 - 32:57)
she will have realization (32:53 - 32:59)
every time you battle her i think i (32:57 - 33:01)
think that's the (32:59 - 33:02)
what do you think it'll be just her evie (33:01 - 33:04)
who does it or do you think like you'll (33:02 - 33:05)
be able to (33:04 - 33:09)
get pokemon who can do that (33:05 - 33:09)
i mean i think you'll be able to get the (33:09 - 33:13)
the things as well i think that though (33:11 - 33:15)
like because i'm assuming evie will be (33:13 - 33:17)
her main pokemon and then (33:15 - 33:20)
she'll change it a bunch of times in (33:17 - 33:22)
order to try to beat you (33:20 - 33:23)
wait (33:22 - 33:26)
you can change a pokemon's terrestrial (33:23 - 33:28)
form (33:26 - 33:29)
so that's my question like do you think (33:28 - 33:31)
that her evie will be unique and that it (33:29 - 33:33)
can like change it it can be like a (33:31 - 33:35)
water tv or a leaf eevee or a fire eevee (33:33 - 33:37)
um or do you think that like you will (33:35 - 33:38)
also be able to get an ev that can (33:37 - 33:40)
change into a bunch of things or you can (33:38 - 33:42)
only get eevs that can like only be (33:40 - 33:44)
grass or only water yeah because like (33:42 - 33:46)
what i picked up on when they were (33:44 - 33:48)
discussing it was like (33:46 - 33:50)
when you catch a pokemon (33:48 - 33:52)
it will have like it's regular pokemon (33:50 - 33:54)
stuff and then (33:52 - 33:56)
a specific (33:54 - 33:58)
terrace (33:56 - 34:00)
alternative (33:58 - 34:03)
right because they they're just like we (34:00 - 34:05)
need to give steve (34:03 - 34:09)
more of what steve wants so now (34:05 - 34:10)
it's going to be like (34:09 - 34:13)
the rarest (34:10 - 34:17)
absolute pokemon that you can get is (34:13 - 34:18)
the (34:17 - 34:19)
uh (34:18 - 34:21)
the cloister (34:19 - 34:22)
with the (34:21 - 34:26)
ground terrastal form with this what are (34:22 - 34:28)
those names that they s (34:26 - 34:29)
the stick (34:28 - 34:31)
brilliant (34:29 - 34:34)
they and and also but like when it's got (34:31 - 34:36)
the what it's got the name it's marked (34:34 - 34:38)
pokemon it's got its own mark and it's (34:36 - 34:42)
got like shiny you gotta get all of them (34:38 - 34:45)
and it's like one in two billion chance (34:42 - 34:48)
that you're going to get that one um (34:45 - 34:51)
yeah i mean like (34:48 - 34:51)
there is (34:52 - 34:57)
there is the the the high likelihood (34:54 - 35:01)
that the once you catch a pokemon with a (34:57 - 35:02)
specific (35:01 - 35:04)
terra type (35:02 - 35:08)
um so if if eevee is normal and it's the (35:04 - 35:10)
pterotype is normal then it gets the (35:08 - 35:12)
ring pop on its head (35:10 - 35:14)
um it's like that weird crown thing (35:12 - 35:18)
that they showed wait why would yup (35:14 - 35:20)
why would a normal eevee have a normal (35:18 - 35:22)
terror type that (35:20 - 35:24)
that yeah because because because like (35:22 - 35:24)
that's what they showed with the (35:24 - 35:27)
starters like the fire like yeah so i (35:24 - 35:28)
think only some pokemon will switch (35:27 - 35:30)
their types one (35:28 - 35:32)
are we in paragraph two of the the press (35:30 - 35:35)
release now the terrastol phenomenon yes (35:32 - 35:38)
yes well well uh (35:35 - 35:38)
okay let me finish this thought because (35:38 - 35:41)
then we're gonna take a break and then (35:40 - 35:43)
we'll talk more about tara (35:41 - 35:46)
there is there is the high likelihood (35:43 - 35:48)
that her that if she has an ev her evie (35:46 - 35:50)
will just stay like normal (35:48 - 35:52)
tara type and then have the ring pop (35:50 - 35:54)
crown and then that's fine because (35:52 - 35:56)
you're right they're they're it the (35:54 - 35:58)
mechanic might be designed where you (35:56 - 36:00)
cannot change it (35:58 - 36:03)
um which was like sword and shield where (36:00 - 36:07)
like i in order to get a g-max kingler i (36:03 - 36:09)
need to find that raid i do that raid i (36:07 - 36:11)
catch that and now i have it (36:09 - 36:14)
and then dlc was like well now anything (36:11 - 36:16)
can be gmax just give it the soup (36:14 - 36:19)
and it's like oh okay like (36:16 - 36:20)
so (36:19 - 36:23)
it could be something like that where (36:20 - 36:24)
they artificially make it rare for the (36:23 - 36:27)
first 6 8 10 months of the game and now (36:24 - 36:28)
there's a way to change it (36:27 - 36:30)
but (36:28 - 36:32)
she could have a way to change it just (36:30 - 36:34)
like leon (36:32 - 36:36)
had hidden ability (36:34 - 36:38)
score bunny (36:36 - 36:42)
before everyone else and he just used it (36:38 - 36:44)
um maybe that's what's in her backpack (36:42 - 36:46)
it's it's the terrestrial soup (36:44 - 36:48)
right yeah the trash (36:46 - 36:51)
she's just stuck (36:48 - 36:53)
i think marvin is making the soup giving (36:51 - 36:55)
it to her (36:53 - 36:58)
it all fits the fluffy clouds do look (36:55 - 37:00)
like dynamaxx gigantomax like of the (36:58 - 37:03)
straps of the backpack (37:00 - 37:05)
if you use your imagination a little bit (37:03 - 37:06)
oh my gosh (37:05 - 37:09)
okay let's take a break we'll talk about (37:06 - 37:11)
the new gimmick when we come back and (37:09 - 37:13)
then there's also three new pokemon so (37:11 - 37:14)
we (37:13 - 37:16)
will be right back (37:14 - 37:21)
and we are back from our break (37:16 - 37:22)
okay (37:21 - 37:24)
the gimmick (37:22 - 37:25)
uh (37:24 - 37:26)
terrastr (37:25 - 37:29)
terrastol pokemon phenomenon (37:26 - 37:32)
tetrastyle terrestrial there we go i got (37:29 - 37:32)
there (37:32 - 37:34)
this phenomenon is found only in the (37:32 - 37:37)
paldea region and it makes pokemon shine (37:34 - 37:40)
and glimmer like gems when a pokemon (37:37 - 37:43)
terratalizes a terror jewel will appear (37:40 - 37:46)
above the pokemon's head like a crown (37:43 - 37:48)
and the bodies the body will glisten (37:46 - 37:51)
like a cut gemstone all pokemon in the (37:48 - 37:53)
paladio region can (37:51 - 37:55)
terrace allies to gain special powers (37:53 - 37:57)
and the terrestrialization allows (37:55 - 37:58)
players to enhance their battle (37:57 - 38:00)
strategies by increasing the power of (37:58 - 38:03)
any move that has the same type as the (38:00 - 38:05)
pokemon's terror type (38:03 - 38:07)
there are a 18 types (38:05 - 38:08)
no (38:07 - 38:11)
new type confirmed meaning there are (38:08 - 38:12)
countless combinations of pokemon and (38:11 - 38:15)
terror types (38:12 - 38:17)
players can terrace realize a pokemon (38:15 - 38:19)
once per battle and the transformation (38:17 - 38:21)
will last until the battle ends (38:19 - 38:23)
players will need a terra orb to (38:21 - 38:25)
trialocialize a pokemon which will need (38:23 - 38:28)
to be recharged after each use players (38:25 - 38:30)
can only charge their terra orb by (38:28 - 38:32)
touching crystals overflowing with (38:30 - 38:34)
terrestrial energy by or by going to a (38:32 - 38:36)
pokemon center (38:34 - 38:37)
um (38:36 - 38:40)
okay we'll stop there (38:37 - 38:41)
so (38:40 - 38:43)
there are (38:41 - 38:44)
okay so (38:43 - 38:47)
we can talk about gimmicks here just a (38:44 - 38:48)
quick overview (38:47 - 38:50)
black and white (38:48 - 38:53)
battle gimmick was gems there was a gem (38:50 - 38:56)
for every single type of pokemon when (38:53 - 38:58)
you use the gem it would be used up in (38:56 - 39:00)
battle (38:58 - 39:02)
now a days in a game like sword and (39:00 - 39:04)
shield there's only like two types of (39:02 - 39:06)
gems i think it's (39:04 - 39:08)
normal gem and i think it's (39:06 - 39:11)
flying gem and then all the other gems (39:08 - 39:12)
are gone actually i don't think it's (39:11 - 39:13)
flying gym (39:12 - 39:15)
normal for sure i think normal gem is (39:13 - 39:19)
the only gem that got preserved (39:15 - 39:19)
yeah i don't think there is another one (39:19 - 39:23)
um (39:22 - 39:25)
and so that was very popular and (39:23 - 39:27)
competitive you would see pokemon like (39:25 - 39:30)
um tornadoes run the move acrobatics it (39:27 - 39:32)
would it would use acrobatics it would (39:30 - 39:34)
get the power of the normal type gem and (39:32 - 39:36)
then acrobatics get stronger when you're (39:34 - 39:37)
not holding a held item and all of a (39:36 - 39:39)
sudden it's not holding the whole item (39:37 - 39:40)
because it used the flying gem and now (39:39 - 39:42)
it's anyways uh it was very (39:40 - 39:44)
gems are very very popular (39:42 - 39:46)
um another thing in black and white is (39:44 - 39:48)
like a dragon type pokemon could hold a (39:46 - 39:50)
dragon gem and because fairy type didn't (39:48 - 39:52)
exist in black and white (39:50 - 39:53)
not a lot of things could survive a (39:52 - 39:56)
dragon type move with a dragon gem (39:53 - 39:58)
um (39:56 - 40:01)
in x and y your gimmick was mega (39:58 - 40:03)
evolution (40:01 - 40:07)
uh which i would argue for all (40:03 - 40:07)
comparison uh (40:08 - 40:14)
probably the most limiting one because (40:11 - 40:16)
going back to black and white any (40:14 - 40:18)
pokemon could hold a gem (40:16 - 40:20)
and it didn't have to match its type you (40:18 - 40:23)
could have a hydragen hold a dark gem (40:20 - 40:25)
well hold on hydration is dark you could (40:23 - 40:28)
have a hydrogen hold a fire gem because (40:25 - 40:29)
i believe it gets flamethrower and that (40:28 - 40:32)
flamethrower would be stronger (40:29 - 40:33)
there were only (40:32 - 40:35)
across two games (40:33 - 40:36)
uh (40:35 - 40:40)
64 i believe mega pokemon (40:36 - 40:41)
um (40:40 - 40:43)
so even though (40:41 - 40:46)
those games were the last games (40:43 - 40:48)
that required all (40:46 - 40:50)
the pokemon to get the shiny charm 700 (40:48 - 40:51)
and something (40:50 - 40:56)
uh very limiting in that sense of (40:51 - 40:56)
i hope you really like kangaskhan (40:56 - 41:00)
because that's one of your 64 pokemon (40:58 - 41:02)
that could mega (41:00 - 41:06)
then we moved on to (41:02 - 41:09)
sun and moon which had z crystals (41:06 - 41:11)
um which (41:09 - 41:12)
there were specific z crystals like (41:11 - 41:15)
there was a pikachu sea crystal but for (41:12 - 41:16)
the most part (41:15 - 41:18)
you could put any z crystal on any (41:16 - 41:19)
pokemon (41:18 - 41:22)
um mimikyu could hold a fairy type z (41:19 - 41:24)
crystal called a normal type z crystal (41:22 - 41:26)
it could hold a (41:24 - 41:28)
fairy type z crystal right (41:26 - 41:30)
uh and those were just fancier versions (41:28 - 41:33)
of gems (41:30 - 41:35)
but that was that was uh you know (41:33 - 41:37)
pretty much the the gimmick there well (41:35 - 41:39)
you know you had to learn the dance too (41:37 - 41:41)
yeah it's true you did there was a dance (41:39 - 41:43)
yeah that there was a dance (41:41 - 41:44)
um (41:43 - 41:47)
but but really like very comparable to (41:44 - 41:49)
gems in a lot of ways (41:47 - 41:51)
i guess it wouldn't get used up so (41:49 - 41:53)
acrobatics (41:51 - 41:55)
like you're still holding the gem (41:53 - 41:56)
anyways and then (41:55 - 41:58)
you know sword and shield had dynamaxx (41:56 - 42:01)
slash gigantomax which again all pokemon (41:58 - 42:03)
could use (42:01 - 42:04)
and i know there's this there's this (42:03 - 42:05)
constant (42:04 - 42:07)
roar of people that are like just bring (42:05 - 42:10)
back megas make more megas (42:07 - 42:11)
which (42:10 - 42:13)
hey i liked megas i think the megas that (42:11 - 42:17)
exist are cool (42:13 - 42:17)
but i don't think that would ever work (42:18 - 42:22)
because they would have to then (42:20 - 42:24)
literally double their pokedex at that (42:22 - 42:28)
point right like if if (42:24 - 42:28)
if (42:29 - 42:33)
sword and shield which started with 400 (42:31 - 42:35)
pokemon had megas (42:33 - 42:37)
for every pokemon (42:35 - 42:39)
now all of a sudden you have 800 pokemon (42:37 - 42:40)
and that's with a cut to pokedex right (42:39 - 42:43)
like they cut the pokedex to like make (42:40 - 42:46)
animations and to like (42:43 - 42:47)
change (42:46 - 42:50)
the to change stuff around and like to (42:47 - 42:52)
whatever reason you whether believe or (42:50 - 42:54)
not believe for them to cut the pokedex (42:52 - 42:57)
having a mega of every pokemon doubles (42:54 - 42:58)
that pokedex (42:57 - 43:00)
um (42:58 - 43:01)
and even if you're like well just mega (43:00 - 43:03)
another 50. (43:01 - 43:05)
it's like okay well i don't care that i (43:03 - 43:07)
don't care about tangela i don't care (43:05 - 43:10)
about magnazone how dare you how double (43:07 - 43:12)
dare you (43:10 - 43:14)
[Applause] (43:12 - 43:16)
it has to be about you and the ones you (43:14 - 43:17)
care about (43:16 - 43:19)
i didn't care about or to know i'm not (43:17 - 43:21)
gonna short somebody they're mega oh i (43:19 - 43:24)
don't know that's true yeah i'm sure all (43:21 - 43:25)
the audino fans are very happy with (43:24 - 43:28)
their mega autuno (43:25 - 43:30)
i think they i think they did learn (43:28 - 43:32)
something of like (43:30 - 43:35)
it's important for all the pokemon to (43:32 - 43:37)
have something and that you like they do (43:35 - 43:38)
they did specialize in pokemon right (43:37 - 43:41)
like kingler machamp um (43:38 - 43:43)
blastoise venusaur like they did get (43:41 - 43:44)
special forms (43:43 - 43:46)
but at least (43:44 - 43:48)
all the pokemon could use that gimmick (43:46 - 43:50)
right like you could go through x and y (43:48 - 43:52)
and just never have a pokemon with the (43:50 - 43:54)
ability to me like they give you a (43:52 - 43:56)
lucario right and they're like there's a (43:54 - 43:59)
la caro he can mega but like (43:56 - 44:00)
if you don't like lucario you would put (43:59 - 44:01)
it on your team and then you can go (44:00 - 44:03)
through that whole game without ever (44:01 - 44:06)
having that button lit up (44:03 - 44:10)
whereas at least in an alola (44:06 - 44:10)
like at any point you could put a z (44:10 - 44:13)
crystal on anything (44:12 - 44:16)
you you could you could mega bit blop (44:13 - 44:17)
bloop (44:16 - 44:19)
with your mimikyu (44:17 - 44:20)
super happy friend time i don't remember (44:19 - 44:22)
what his move was called super happy (44:20 - 44:24)
friend time (44:22 - 44:25)
you you could do that to every single (44:24 - 44:27)
young goose you walked across i don't (44:25 - 44:29)
know why you would but you could (44:27 - 44:31)
um (44:29 - 44:33)
and with the the gigantomax dynamax (44:31 - 44:35)
thing (44:33 - 44:37)
you you're limited to like gym leader (44:35 - 44:39)
battles but (44:37 - 44:41)
you could you could dynamax your gossip (44:39 - 44:43)
flurry you could dynomax your arrow kudo (44:41 - 44:44)
you could dynamics your cramarat you (44:43 - 44:47)
could dynamax your squirtle like (44:44 - 44:52)
you could do that to every pokemon so (44:47 - 44:52)
do i think like megas are forever gone (44:54 - 45:01)
no like if they do an x and y remake (44:58 - 45:02)
which of course they will because they (45:01 - 45:04)
will remake every game until people are (45:02 - 45:05)
like they remade (45:04 - 45:07)
red and blue what four times three times (45:05 - 45:08)
now (45:07 - 45:09)
they will remake every game because it (45:08 - 45:11)
will continue making their money (45:09 - 45:12)
so (45:11 - 45:14)
yes if they do an x and y remake do i (45:12 - 45:15)
believe megas will come back yeah of (45:14 - 45:17)
course do i believe they'll add a couple (45:15 - 45:19)
new ones to like sell more copies of a (45:17 - 45:21)
yes of course i do but like (45:19 - 45:23)
i think as an overall gimmick (45:21 - 45:25)
they learned that they need to apply (45:23 - 45:27)
this to every pokemon (45:25 - 45:29)
um to like (45:27 - 45:32)
cast a wider net of (45:29 - 45:35)
oh my favorite can do this (45:32 - 45:37)
versus like (45:35 - 45:38)
i don't care about charizard i don't (45:37 - 45:40)
care about lucario i don't care about (45:38 - 45:42)
pikachu what do you got for uh chimecho (45:40 - 45:44)
nothing not interested (45:42 - 45:47)
yeah i mean the way i see it with megas (45:44 - 45:49)
and we don't have to go down this road (45:47 - 45:50)
but it's like (45:49 - 45:52)
black and white was the real (45:50 - 45:54)
introduction of like real competitive (45:52 - 45:57)
vgc like we're gonna make this a real (45:54 - 45:59)
thing and then with x and y and megas (45:57 - 46:02)
they were like let's shape the vgc let's (45:59 - 46:04)
shape the meta and try to control it (46:02 - 46:06)
through these megas and then they were (46:04 - 46:09)
like that is a huge mistake (46:06 - 46:11)
it's like this is more than we can (46:09 - 46:14)
handle so let's find another way let's (46:11 - 46:16)
step back from this and find another way (46:14 - 46:18)
to do it (46:16 - 46:21)
yeah and um (46:18 - 46:21)
you know they they did a great job in my (46:21 - 46:26)
opinion (46:24 - 46:28)
with the battle scene in sword and (46:26 - 46:29)
shield (46:28 - 46:30)
they (46:29 - 46:32)
they did it where (46:30 - 46:34)
you know season one (46:32 - 46:36)
was or series one sorry (46:34 - 46:38)
series one was different than series two (46:36 - 46:39)
different than series three different (46:38 - 46:41)
than series four (46:39 - 46:43)
they did it where they had loud legends (46:41 - 46:44)
they didn't allow legends they did it (46:43 - 46:46)
where they allowed dynamaxx they didn't (46:44 - 46:48)
allow dynamics they allowed it where (46:46 - 46:49)
these dynamaxx pokemon were these (46:48 - 46:52)
gigantomax pokemon were legal these were (46:49 - 46:53)
not (46:52 - 46:55)
um (46:53 - 46:57)
they did they did a series where they (46:55 - 46:59)
banned the top 10 most popular pokemon (46:57 - 47:01)
like it was (46:59 - 47:03)
really great (47:01 - 47:05)
and because every pokemon could use the (47:03 - 47:08)
gimmick it didn't feel restricting (47:05 - 47:11)
imagine if they did a top 10 ban (47:08 - 47:12)
in (47:11 - 47:13)
x and y (47:12 - 47:15)
like the number one most used pokemon (47:13 - 47:18)
competitively was mega kangaskhan there (47:15 - 47:21)
were only 64 mega pokemon (47:18 - 47:25)
allowed and realistically only like (47:21 - 47:27)
eight of them were actually competitive (47:25 - 47:30)
kangaskhan being like the the number one (47:27 - 47:32)
for a very very long time obviously once (47:30 - 47:33)
they opened into legendaries (47:32 - 47:35)
um (47:33 - 47:37)
you know rayquaza and and primal groudon (47:35 - 47:41)
primal kyogre were dominated of course (47:37 - 47:43)
uh (47:41 - 47:43)
so like (47:44 - 47:48)
i think they figured it out right (47:46 - 47:53)
i think i think they they saw that like (47:48 - 47:55)
we added this new gimmick we added the (47:53 - 47:59)
mega gimmick to x and y and literally (47:55 - 48:01)
most of these megas are useless (47:59 - 48:03)
competitively like you could still use (48:01 - 48:05)
them for the story but that was the (48:03 - 48:06)
point i always like made with people is (48:05 - 48:07)
like (48:06 - 48:10)
cool like no one is using mega bay net (48:07 - 48:11)
in (48:10 - 48:12)
in (48:11 - 48:14)
competitive (48:12 - 48:16)
what are you doing with it in the story (48:14 - 48:19)
besides like mega maggoting it against a (48:16 - 48:21)
gym leader or something for (48:19 - 48:22)
well that's the other half of it is i (48:21 - 48:23)
think when they realized that they (48:22 - 48:25)
couldn't control megas they were like (48:23 - 48:27)
the only megas we're gonna make are the (48:25 - 48:29)
ones that nobody (48:27 - 48:31)
nobody's gonna use (48:29 - 48:34)
we'll just make these garbage megas (48:31 - 48:36)
um (48:34 - 48:36)
yeah so (48:39 - 48:43)
so going back to the new gimmick i like (48:40 - 48:45)
the crystallization that happens with (48:43 - 48:46)
the pokemon (48:45 - 48:50)
but man the little hats are kind of dumb (48:46 - 48:50)
i think i think they got the point (48:52 - 48:55)
across without the hat like (48:53 - 48:57)
turning crystals (48:55 - 49:00)
great now the the hat is critical (48:57 - 49:03)
because because (49:00 - 49:07)
any pokemon could have a different type (49:03 - 49:10)
for its terrestrial type (49:07 - 49:12)
so you have to have a visual (49:10 - 49:15)
for your opponent to be able to see what (49:12 - 49:18)
type it now is (49:15 - 49:18)
yeah that's true so when like fue coco (49:18 - 49:23)
terras (49:22 - 49:25)
there's that weird like (49:23 - 49:28)
candle on his head a little candelabra (49:25 - 49:29)
just changed the color of like the (49:28 - 49:31)
glitter because that you turn the (49:29 - 49:33)
pokemon into a gym so just like make the (49:31 - 49:35)
pokemon color differently i agree yeah (49:33 - 49:38)
but there's 18 colors and accessibility (49:35 - 49:40)
with people who are color blind nah we (49:38 - 49:42)
gotta have yeah i (49:40 - 49:44)
i would (49:42 - 49:46)
see if this is the game with colorblind (49:44 - 49:48)
mode i doubt it but hopefully one day (49:46 - 49:49)
we'll get there (49:48 - 49:51)
um (49:49 - 49:51)
is the ground type tarot gonna be like a (49:54 - 49:58)
shovel above their head like i'm trying (49:56 - 50:00)
to think of like (49:58 - 50:02)
what the hat would be it'll just be a (50:00 - 50:05)
piece of coal be a mountain (50:02 - 50:08)
maybe kind of that'd be like rock (50:05 - 50:10)
rock will be a boulder (50:08 - 50:11)
okay (50:10 - 50:14)
i've got answers i've got answers (50:11 - 50:16)
yeah i think the hats are just a little (50:14 - 50:18)
silly i get that you need to like (50:16 - 50:20)
signify i don't know maybe just put a (50:18 - 50:21)
symbol next to their name when they do (50:20 - 50:23)
it like the mega symbol was next to the (50:21 - 50:26)
pokemon's name when it magged (50:23 - 50:28)
like it would be and true (50:26 - 50:31)
yeah the hats are a little much (50:28 - 50:31)
like what is quack sleeve supposed to be (50:32 - 50:36)
is that like a upside down anchor (50:33 - 50:37)
or is it or is it supposed to be like a (50:36 - 50:41)
waterfall a water fountain (50:37 - 50:41)
the only one that looks good to me is (50:41 - 50:45)
like the flowers the flowers look good (50:43 - 50:48)
i think the flowers are cute (50:45 - 50:48)
the real question is fighting type now (50:50 - 50:53)
that you've put that thought into my (50:51 - 50:56)
mind it's like a giant (50:53 - 50:57)
punching (50:56 - 50:59)
all i can think is knives (50:57 - 51:01)
[Laughter] (50:59 - 51:02)
maybe a boxing glove i don't know yeah (51:01 - 51:04)
what would it be yeah that is they they (51:02 - 51:07)
do yeah (51:04 - 51:10)
what would dark be (51:07 - 51:10)
just like a swirling shadow that floats (51:11 - 51:15)
above your head that is shiny it's just (51:13 - 51:16)
they should just make it like a little (51:15 - 51:18)
spirit tomb and then when you translate (51:16 - 51:21)
spirit tomb it's just two spirit tombs (51:18 - 51:24)
there you go (51:21 - 51:24)
i you know i when when you i i just i (51:25 - 51:30)
just poo pooed on mega for a good five (51:28 - 51:33)
minutes which (51:30 - 51:36)
i stand by that but when they originally (51:33 - 51:38)
announced mega i was hyped for it i was (51:36 - 51:40)
like oh mega seems sick they seem tight (51:38 - 51:42)
well when you first thought that every (51:40 - 51:44)
pokemon was going to get a mega form (51:42 - 51:45)
that's sure (51:44 - 51:47)
sure (51:45 - 51:48)
that's true we did when there was still (51:47 - 51:51)
hope in the world (51:48 - 51:52)
um (51:51 - 51:54)
and then when they showed z crystals i (51:52 - 51:56)
was like man that looks cool (51:54 - 51:58)
but what okay here's the thing so they (51:56 - 51:59)
showed megas i was super hyped for it (51:58 - 52:01)
they introduced megas (51:59 - 52:04)
and then my experience through the story (52:01 - 52:06)
and i was like (52:04 - 52:08)
i i personally found x and y to be (52:06 - 52:12)
relatively easy not because of the the (52:08 - 52:15)
experience share or (52:12 - 52:18)
or anything like that it's just (52:15 - 52:19)
to me (52:18 - 52:23)
most pokemon games are relatively easy (52:19 - 52:24)
because (52:23 - 52:26)
i feel like i have a pretty good sense (52:24 - 52:28)
of playing video games and the example i (52:26 - 52:30)
will use is that i've been playing it (52:28 - 52:32)
takes two with irene (52:30 - 52:34)
which i think is a really good game and (52:32 - 52:36)
it requires i don't know if you guys (52:34 - 52:39)
know this game but it requires (52:36 - 52:40)
uh (52:39 - 52:42)
both of you to work together to like (52:40 - 52:43)
beat the game right and the cool gimmick (52:42 - 52:45)
of the game is like only one person has (52:43 - 52:46)
to buy it so if i bought it and i wanted (52:45 - 52:48)
to play with pengu (52:46 - 52:49)
they wouldn't have to buy it i could (52:48 - 52:52)
just invite them to join my game and (52:49 - 52:53)
then they could play through the entire (52:52 - 52:55)
game with me which is really really cool (52:53 - 52:57)
um (52:55 - 52:57)
but (52:57 - 53:00)
usually each person has like a gimmick (52:57 - 53:03)
so like uh in one level (53:00 - 53:05)
uh she had a hammer and i had nails and (53:03 - 53:07)
so i would have to use my nails she (53:05 - 53:08)
would have to use the hammer like i (53:07 - 53:09)
can't like (53:08 - 53:11)
reach over and grab her controller and (53:09 - 53:13)
control but well i'm sure i'm sure (53:11 - 53:14)
there's a relationship where somebody (53:13 - 53:16)
tried to do that but it would be very (53:14 - 53:17)
hard for one person to control two (53:16 - 53:20)
controllers anyways (53:17 - 53:21)
playing through that and irene's played (53:20 - 53:23)
through every single pokemon game right (53:21 - 53:25)
and she's played other games she's she's (53:23 - 53:27)
completed (53:25 - 53:29)
king's fall in destiny one of the (53:27 - 53:31)
hardest raids she's completed it many (53:29 - 53:33)
times she's completed other (53:31 - 53:35)
things in destinies she plays it like (53:33 - 53:37)
she's playing she's she's she plays (53:35 - 53:38)
video games she's not very good at video (53:37 - 53:40)
games but she plays it but the thing (53:38 - 53:42)
that i realized playing it takes two (53:40 - 53:43)
directly with her not being able to grab (53:42 - 53:46)
her controller is like (53:43 - 53:49)
i feel like she's lacking the sense this (53:46 - 53:51)
sounds like i'm like (53:49 - 53:53)
burying my wife (53:51 - 53:55)
like i feel like if you play enough (53:53 - 53:57)
video games you just kind of understand (53:55 - 53:59)
what the game is asking for you right (53:57 - 54:01)
like i will i will walk (53:59 - 54:03)
i will walk into a level and look and (54:01 - 54:04)
just look around and be like okay we (54:03 - 54:06)
have to do this this and this and that (54:04 - 54:08)
will open the door (54:06 - 54:09)
and (54:08 - 54:11)
it takes her really long to figure out (54:09 - 54:15)
what the game is trying to ask of her (54:11 - 54:16)
um (54:15 - 54:18)
and i think that there's there's a fine (54:16 - 54:21)
balance in pokemon games where pokemon (54:18 - 54:24)
wants (54:21 - 54:26)
you to make it through the end of i (54:24 - 54:28)
think all games of this they want you to (54:26 - 54:29)
make it through the end of the game and (54:28 - 54:31)
enjoy it and have fun and not get (54:29 - 54:32)
terribly stuck but they want to add a (54:31 - 54:35)
little bit of challenge to it (54:32 - 54:37)
and so i feel like the little bit of (54:35 - 54:39)
challenge they add to pokemon games is (54:37 - 54:41)
like this sense of surprise of like you (54:39 - 54:43)
don't know what this pokemon is going to (54:41 - 54:45)
do you don't know what type this is you (54:43 - 54:47)
and i think a really good example of (54:45 - 54:49)
that is ultra necrosma in ultrasound (54:47 - 54:51)
ultra moon (54:49 - 54:53)
the surprise is you don't know what type (54:51 - 54:54)
it is you don't know what moves it is (54:53 - 54:56)
you don't know how fast it is (54:54 - 54:59)
and if you're unprepared or you didn't (54:56 - 55:02)
look anything up alternate necrozma has (54:59 - 55:05)
a really good advantage over you (55:02 - 55:07)
versus somebody that's like oh i looked (55:05 - 55:08)
up its type it's psychic dragon i know (55:07 - 55:10)
that i can use a fairy type move i know (55:08 - 55:13)
i could use a dark type move um i know (55:10 - 55:16)
that like it will out speed me so i'm (55:13 - 55:18)
going to like put a focus stash or use (55:16 - 55:19)
mimikyu and talk like there are (55:18 - 55:21)
obviously there are solutions to it (55:19 - 55:24)
um (55:21 - 55:24)
but anyways going back to x and y i (55:24 - 55:28)
never felt the need to mega (55:26 - 55:31)
because i never felt the battles were (55:28 - 55:33)
tough enough (55:31 - 55:34)
and then i was like well why would i (55:33 - 55:36)
mega like (55:34 - 55:38)
i'm just gonna one shot if i may go (55:36 - 55:40)
whereas if i like don't one shot then i (55:38 - 55:42)
might be in a situation where i have to (55:40 - 55:43)
like think a little bit more right like (55:42 - 55:45)
i can make my own challenge (55:43 - 55:49)
10 seconds of animation say (55:45 - 55:49)
because i was just saving time (55:50 - 55:54)
um (55:51 - 55:54)
i don't know where i was going with that (55:57 - 56:01)
i got so sidetracked off of uh the video (55:58 - 56:04)
game stuff anyways (56:01 - 56:04)
the (56:05 - 56:07)
the the the (56:07 - 56:12)
the having (56:09 - 56:16)
i'm assuming the gym leaders having (56:12 - 56:18)
a (56:16 - 56:21)
possibly a move or a terror form that (56:18 - 56:22)
would surprise you would be the (56:21 - 56:25)
challenge here (56:22 - 56:28)
right like oh i didn't know that (56:25 - 56:30)
you were going to trasolize into a (56:28 - 56:31)
ground type and now your crime type (56:30 - 56:34)
moves are super strong and i brought (56:31 - 56:37)
um (56:34 - 56:37)
but yeah anyways like i look at the (56:40 - 56:44)
gimmick and i'm like ah it seems fine (56:42 - 56:46)
like i'm not as excited for it as i was (56:44 - 56:48)
initially for megas or initially for (56:46 - 56:50)
dynamic like i still do think dynamaxx (56:48 - 56:52)
is is is one of the stronger gimmicks (56:50 - 56:54)
throughout the games (56:52 - 56:57)
well for me it's like uh (56:54 - 57:00)
maybe not dynamaxx but (56:57 - 57:02)
like i mean clearly there's some dynamic (57:00 - 57:06)
something going on but like a (57:02 - 57:09)
combination of (57:06 - 57:10)
the (57:09 - 57:11)
gems (57:10 - 57:13)
and mega (57:11 - 57:15)
i think it's the best way to put it (57:13 - 57:17)
right because (57:15 - 57:20)
i mean in my hypothesis here you can (57:17 - 57:22)
find (57:20 - 57:25)
whatever your target pokemon is (57:22 - 57:26)
with a specific (57:25 - 57:28)
terrastil type (57:26 - 57:32)
so like let's say you want an ev with (57:28 - 57:34)
terrestrial type (57:32 - 57:36)
water because that's gonna (57:34 - 57:38)
it has some powerful water type move (57:36 - 57:40)
that's gonna get a boost (57:38 - 57:42)
except that it's not used up after one (57:40 - 57:45)
use it's for the rest of the (57:42 - 57:46)
battle which is like (57:45 - 57:49)
with the mega version of it (57:46 - 57:50)
so (57:49 - 57:52)
it's like a nice (57:50 - 57:53)
kind of like combination of those two (57:52 - 57:56)
things and then we'll find out much like (57:53 - 57:57)
we did with the gems that it's too (57:56 - 57:58)
powerful (57:57 - 58:00)
and (57:58 - 58:03)
it will all have to be discontinued (58:00 - 58:06)
so how do you guys feel about um sorry (58:03 - 58:08)
okay don't have your thoughts how do you (58:06 - 58:10)
feel about um in the press release where (58:08 - 58:12)
they said that you have to recharge your (58:10 - 58:16)
terra orb after every time you use it (58:12 - 58:18)
i think they just learned that like (58:16 - 58:19)
going through (58:18 - 58:21)
x and y and going through (58:19 - 58:23)
sun and moon (58:21 - 58:24)
that people were just hitting that z (58:23 - 58:27)
move every single turn or people were (58:24 - 58:30)
mega megan lucario and then using (58:27 - 58:32)
aurasphere every single turn because (58:30 - 58:35)
like what would stop you from doing that (58:32 - 58:37)
and that like (58:35 - 58:40)
if that was fun to you then by all means (58:37 - 58:42)
z move the heck out of every single (58:40 - 58:43)
young goose you come across you probably (58:42 - 58:46)
don't need to but you could (58:43 - 58:48)
yeah so i'd say that's (58:46 - 58:50)
the two thoughts on that number one (58:48 - 58:54)
that's not for competitive egc right it (58:50 - 58:55)
won't apply (58:54 - 58:58)
um so what it is (58:55 - 59:01)
it's uh an acknowledgement that as this (58:58 - 59:03)
is an open world (59:01 - 59:07)
game it's like be strategic in how you (59:03 - 59:10)
use your terrastilization (59:07 - 59:13)
because if you out in the field and use (59:10 - 59:14)
it too much (59:13 - 59:16)
you know at the wrong times you're out (59:14 - 59:18)
in the field (59:16 - 59:20)
you're going to have to get back to a (59:18 - 59:22)
pokemon center if you want to use it (59:20 - 59:24)
again (59:22 - 59:26)
yeah yeah i also think there could be a (59:24 - 59:28)
a point where it's like something might (59:26 - 59:30)
be too hard (59:28 - 59:32)
and so (59:30 - 59:34)
does that person (59:32 - 59:35)
i think it's really clever right because (59:34 - 59:37)
like if you get to an enemy or something (59:35 - 59:39)
that's too hard i'm gonna use irene for (59:37 - 59:40)
an example again because she played (59:39 - 59:42)
through all of legends and i watched her (59:40 - 59:44)
play through legends (59:42 - 59:45)
and (59:44 - 59:49)
she lost to um (59:45 - 59:52)
mellie right outside of electrode (59:49 - 59:54)
and (59:52 - 59:57)
she was like i can't beat melly like she (59:54 - 59:58)
lost to him twice (59:57 - 60:00)
and she's like i don't know what to do (59:58 - 60:02)
and i was like well you could level up (60:00 - 60:04)
and she's like i don't know how (60:02 - 60:05)
and i was like you literally just have (60:04 - 60:07)
to like catch pokemon and she's like i (60:05 - 60:09)
don't want to do that that sounds boring (60:07 - 60:11)
like i i caught the pokemon i wanted to (60:09 - 60:13)
catch and i was like i agree with you (60:11 - 60:16)
you're right why would you catch like (60:13 - 60:20)
800 voltorbs that are right over there (60:16 - 60:20)
um (60:20 - 60:23)
but i think like in that in that (60:21 - 60:25)
situation (60:23 - 60:27)
if a person was stuck like the example i (60:25 - 60:29)
just gave and they were like oh i just (60:27 - 60:30)
have to like touch a bunch of these (60:29 - 60:33)
crystal points and now i get my like my (60:30 - 60:34)
super move (60:33 - 60:36)
and i bet that will help me defeat it (60:34 - 60:38)
and then it gives them like a sense of (60:36 - 60:40)
almost direction like (60:38 - 60:43)
i know what i need to do to recharge (60:40 - 60:45)
and now i can strategize this way i'm (60:43 - 60:47)
not saying that that's the best option (60:45 - 60:51)
um but it does give you (60:47 - 60:53)
something to like go back to and maybe (60:51 - 60:54)
like okay (60:53 - 60:56)
i can do this and then while i'm doing (60:54 - 60:58)
this oh i i did discover a pokemon or (60:56 - 61:00)
some or something (60:58 - 61:02)
in an open world game you have to like (61:00 - 61:05)
give reasons to force discovery (61:02 - 61:06)
and (61:05 - 61:09)
in like something like the isle of armor (61:06 - 61:12)
i would go and pick up everything every (61:09 - 61:14)
day i would pick up all the feathers i (61:12 - 61:15)
would pick up all the rare candies i (61:14 - 61:17)
would pick up the like (61:15 - 61:18)
the mints (61:17 - 61:21)
and i would have so much of that stuff (61:18 - 61:22)
and people it would be funny because (61:21 - 61:23)
people would come into my twitch streams (61:22 - 61:25)
and they would be like wow you have so (61:23 - 61:27)
much of this item and it's like yeah (61:25 - 61:28)
because i do this every day and they're (61:27 - 61:29)
like i didn't even i didn't even know (61:28 - 61:31)
that stuff existed because they don't (61:29 - 61:33)
have like a sense to like once you go (61:31 - 61:34)
around the island once like the game (61:33 - 61:36)
doesn't say like hey this stuff respawns (61:34 - 61:38)
every day or hey like these good items (61:36 - 61:41)
refresh every day at like midnight the (61:38 - 61:43)
game never really gives you a reason to (61:41 - 61:45)
explore i guess they gave you a reason (61:43 - 61:47)
to explore of like oh that light that (61:45 - 61:49)
that red beam back on that island is lit (61:47 - 61:51)
up but like most people are just like (61:49 - 61:52)
i'm just wishing pieces i don't want to (61:51 - 61:55)
actually travel (61:52 - 61:55)
um so yeah i think i think it's i think (61:55 - 62:01)
it's just like a another reason to (61:58 - 62:04)
explore i do want to talk about the (62:01 - 62:06)
the like types right because the the (62:04 - 62:07)
press release (62:06 - 62:10)
and the website and make it seem like (62:07 - 62:11)
um (62:10 - 62:14)
their wording makes it seem (62:11 - 62:16)
that (62:14 - 62:19)
all pokemon can be (62:16 - 62:23)
all types correct which (62:19 - 62:23)
we don't know (62:23 - 62:28)
um (62:26 - 62:30)
so it says all pokemon in paldea can (62:28 - 62:32)
terrace the lies to gain a special power (62:30 - 62:34)
first each pokemon has a pterotype a (62:32 - 62:37)
pokemon stereotype is inactive until the (62:34 - 62:39)
pokemon triathlonizes at (62:37 - 62:40)
that time it will change to the terror (62:39 - 62:42)
type for example some eevee will have a (62:40 - 62:44)
normal terror type but some other eevee (62:42 - 62:46)
will have flying terror type there are (62:44 - 62:48)
18 types meaning there are countless (62:46 - 62:50)
combinations of pokemon and tarot types (62:48 - 62:53)
uh (62:50 - 62:53)
when now there's actually countable like (62:53 - 62:57)
18 times (62:55 - 62:59)
however many pokemon there are there you (62:57 - 63:02)
go (62:59 - 63:02)
this and so this brings it back to a (63:03 - 63:08)
move called hidden power which i'm not (63:06 - 63:10)
sure if you two are familiar with (63:08 - 63:13)
hidden power was a really (63:10 - 63:15)
bad move (63:13 - 63:17)
and what what happened is that there (63:15 - 63:18)
were specific (63:17 - 63:20)
ivs (63:18 - 63:23)
ivs being individual values that a (63:20 - 63:25)
pokemon is (63:23 - 63:28)
born with hatched with caught with right (63:25 - 63:30)
the particular genetics of the pokemon (63:28 - 63:33)
yes that make pokemon unique (63:30 - 63:36)
and those ivs would determine the hidden (63:33 - 63:38)
power type (63:36 - 63:42)
so for example if you were running um (63:38 - 63:44)
like a spirit tomb (63:42 - 63:47)
and maybe you were having problems with (63:44 - 63:49)
garchomp spirit tomb (63:47 - 63:51)
i'm i'm pretty sure i'm right on this (63:49 - 63:53)
example just just say for just follow (63:51 - 63:55)
along here spirit i'm sure there's one (63:53 - 63:57)
person being like well actually anyways (63:55 - 63:59)
uh spirit tomb you could do like a (63:57 - 64:01)
hidden power ice so spirit tube normally (63:59 - 64:03)
gets ghost type moves dark type moves i (64:01 - 64:04)
don't think it gets any ice type move (64:03 - 64:06)
but you could have that ice type (64:04 - 64:09)
coverage if you had hidden power ice (64:06 - 64:11)
there's there was no way in old pokemon (64:09 - 64:14)
games um prior to them getting they got (64:11 - 64:16)
rid of pen power in (64:14 - 64:19)
generation eight which (64:16 - 64:21)
again people that were very upset about (64:19 - 64:22)
the national decks also very upset about (64:21 - 64:24)
hidden power (64:22 - 64:26)
i quickly realized those people i don't (64:24 - 64:26)
want to be friends with because hidden (64:26 - 64:28)
power was a garbage type move (64:26 - 64:29)
and (64:28 - 64:32)
there's no garbage type it (64:29 - 64:35)
it's it was a bad (64:32 - 64:37)
it was a bad move because like (64:35 - 64:39)
pokemon has gotten to the point (64:37 - 64:41)
where if (64:39 - 64:43)
if you've got a grookie and sword and (64:41 - 64:45)
shield (64:43 - 64:46)
you could (64:45 - 64:47)
that grookie (64:46 - 64:49)
realistically is never going to be (64:47 - 64:52)
competitive ready or or perfect correct (64:49 - 64:53)
it's probably gonna it's probably not (64:52 - 64:56)
even gonna have like one good iv (64:53 - 64:57)
but you could take that grookie all (64:56 - 64:59)
through sword and shield bond with that (64:57 - 65:02)
grookie love that grookie and then at (64:59 - 65:04)
the end you might be like oh i wanna i (65:02 - 65:06)
wanna try players cup three (65:04 - 65:08)
and barilla boom is really good but my (65:06 - 65:11)
grookie myrilloboom doesn't have the (65:08 - 65:13)
hidden ability (65:11 - 65:15)
which grassy terrain (65:13 - 65:17)
well there's an item for that you give (65:15 - 65:18)
it the hidden ability capsule now your (65:17 - 65:20)
grookie has (65:18 - 65:22)
grassy terrain great (65:20 - 65:23)
you're like well my [ __ ] doesn't have (65:22 - 65:25)
perfect ivs (65:23 - 65:27)
well young trainer we've introduced this (65:25 - 65:29)
thing called bottle caps now your (65:27 - 65:32)
grookie can have perfect diabetes well (65:29 - 65:34)
my guruki doesn't have the right nature (65:32 - 65:36)
everyone keeps telling me adamant nature (65:34 - 65:38)
is what i need to do i have modest (65:36 - 65:40)
nature one of the worst type natures for (65:38 - 65:41)
grookie (65:40 - 65:44)
well my young trainer we have these (65:41 - 65:46)
things called the mints (65:44 - 65:49)
they have really made it where you can (65:46 - 65:51)
take a pokemon that wherever you get (65:49 - 65:54)
maybe it was traded from your friend or (65:51 - 65:56)
you hatched it randomly or you you you (65:54 - 65:58)
came across it on route 1 and it was (65:56 - 66:00)
like a shiny wulu or you started with it (65:58 - 66:03)
or maybe it was like a charizard from (66:00 - 66:05)
um fire red leaf green that you brought (66:03 - 66:06)
all the way up they've really made it (66:05 - 66:08)
where you could take (66:06 - 66:10)
any of your pokemon (66:08 - 66:13)
and like make them (66:10 - 66:15)
viable competitively or just you know (66:13 - 66:17)
give them perfect ivs for the sake of (66:15 - 66:18)
saying like this is my favorite (66:17 - 66:20)
charizard i don't use i don't play (66:18 - 66:22)
competitive but it's a perfect charizard (66:20 - 66:24)
because i made them that way (66:22 - 66:26)
hidden power there was no way for that (66:24 - 66:28)
there was no way to ever change the (66:26 - 66:30)
hidden power so you could do all of that (66:28 - 66:32)
work for that really boom that i gave (66:30 - 66:35)
bottle caps mints uh ability capsule but (66:32 - 66:37)
there would have been no way to change (66:35 - 66:40)
its hidden ability (66:37 - 66:42)
it's hidden sorry it's (66:40 - 66:43)
nature (66:42 - 66:46)
hidden power type hidden power type (66:43 - 66:48)
to be a move that you needed the (66:46 - 66:50)
coverage for they would have just (66:48 - 66:52)
introduced the hidden power charm that's (66:50 - 66:54)
true (66:52 - 66:58)
the hidden power capsule (66:54 - 66:58)
um (66:59 - 67:02)
so i think getting rid of pinpower was (67:00 - 67:04)
good and when they showed the (67:02 - 67:06)
terrestrializing terrestrializing people (67:04 - 67:08)
then jumped to like oh this is like this (67:06 - 67:10)
is like hidden in power again right like (67:08 - 67:12)
i can i'm gonna go catch a spirit tomb (67:10 - 67:14)
in scarlet and violet i'm gonna give it (67:12 - 67:17)
the the hidden power terrassolizing ice (67:14 - 67:19)
type thing i'm gonna have that coverage (67:17 - 67:21)
again i don't think that's how it's (67:19 - 67:22)
going to work and i think there's enough (67:21 - 67:26)
proof on the website to to clarify that (67:22 - 67:27)
and i think there's enough proof in the (67:26 - 67:28)
last game (67:27 - 67:29)
um (67:28 - 67:32)
and how they're bringing back raids to (67:29 - 67:34)
kind of solidify that they they kind of (67:32 - 67:36)
know what they're doing here (67:34 - 67:38)
so um (67:36 - 67:39)
so i (67:38 - 67:41)
while i think that the statement on (67:39 - 67:43)
their website is true (67:41 - 67:45)
there are 18 types meaning countless (67:43 - 67:47)
combinations of pokemon and terror types (67:45 - 67:50)
i think they are in complete control of (67:47 - 67:52)
how they're going to do this (67:50 - 67:55)
and i don't think it's going to be (67:52 - 67:58)
you catch 18 volt orbs in the wild and (67:55 - 67:59)
one of these voltorbs is ice and one of (67:58 - 68:01)
these are fire and one of these is (67:59 - 68:03)
electric they have specifically said (68:01 - 68:05)
that terror types are rare and that (68:03 - 68:09)
terror types are mostly found in raids (68:05 - 68:11)
and they can use the word mostly found (68:09 - 68:13)
in raids because they've showed a (68:11 - 68:14)
pikachu (68:13 - 68:16)
and they're like this pikachu is flying (68:14 - 68:17)
and you get it through distribution that (68:16 - 68:19)
fits that sentence of mostly found in (68:17 - 68:21)
raids because the other one percent is (68:19 - 68:23)
founded like distributions or like (68:21 - 68:25)
pokemon home or like another game (68:23 - 68:26)
um (68:25 - 68:29)
so if they are mostly found in raids and (68:26 - 68:32)
they show on the website that there is a (68:29 - 68:35)
grass there is a green crystal and they (68:32 - 68:36)
and (68:35 - 68:38)
that they say on the website that this (68:36 - 68:40)
is a grass terror type meaning you are (68:38 - 68:42)
going to see that this is a grass terror (68:40 - 68:45)
type raid and the pokemon you catch in (68:42 - 68:48)
there will be the grass terror type so (68:45 - 68:50)
if you go into that raid and you see a (68:48 - 68:52)
gardevoir that garnivore is going to be (68:50 - 68:55)
grass terror type but as we know from (68:52 - 68:57)
sword and shield raids it's usually like (68:55 - 69:00)
ten pokemon and then the guard of war is (68:57 - 69:01)
a one percent the arcanine is a five (69:00 - 69:04)
percent the the the squivet is a thirty (69:01 - 69:07)
percent so (69:04 - 69:11)
if the raid color determines what terra (69:07 - 69:14)
type there is they are guaranteeing the (69:11 - 69:16)
pokemon in that raid pool is that (69:14 - 69:18)
specific terror type meaning they can (69:16 - 69:22)
control which pokemon get which terra (69:18 - 69:25)
types so is it possible for (69:22 - 69:27)
for charizard (69:25 - 69:29)
for example to get (69:27 - 69:31)
water electric flying (69:29 - 69:35)
yes but only if it exists in a raid den (69:31 - 69:37)
and who's to say it is going to exist in (69:35 - 69:39)
that raid then (69:37 - 69:40)
and (69:39 - 69:42)
i know this is a really long-winded (69:40 - 69:44)
conversation but like when you start the (69:42 - 69:45)
game (69:44 - 69:48)
and there well i'll use charmander and (69:45 - 69:50)
there is no charmander in the raid dens (69:48 - 69:52)
then your charmander (69:50 - 69:55)
can only be probably (69:52 - 69:57)
fire or flying (69:55 - 69:59)
right (69:57 - 70:02)
whatever whatever the default it assigns (69:59 - 70:03)
to (70:02 - 70:05)
they could do a raid event in the future (70:03 - 70:06)
where it's like oh this weekend we're (70:05 - 70:08)
putting charmanders in raids and those (70:06 - 70:11)
charmanders in raids will fall under the (70:08 - 70:15)
water terror type now you can get a fire (70:11 - 70:16)
charmander and then you can get a water (70:15 - 70:20)
charmander they they have already proven (70:16 - 70:22)
that they have been rotating raids every (70:20 - 70:23)
month games been out for three years (70:22 - 70:25)
they've rotated them every month they've (70:23 - 70:27)
given us special raid weekends they've (70:25 - 70:29)
given us shiny raid weekends (70:27 - 70:31)
they (70:29 - 70:32)
they (70:31 - 70:35)
also controlled gigantomax pretty well (70:32 - 70:39)
like when you started sword and shield (70:35 - 70:39)
they promoted what did what did they (70:40 - 70:43)
promote it wasn't it was (70:42 - 70:44)
it was like (70:43 - 70:47)
dreadnought and something else (70:44 - 70:49)
and so you went into raids you would (70:47 - 70:51)
catch like dreadnob but like kingler or (70:49 - 70:54)
machamp or gengar those were like really (70:51 - 70:57)
rare gigantomax raids (70:54 - 70:58)
and then all of a sudden the month would (70:57 - 71:00)
rotate over and they're like oh we're (70:58 - 71:01)
promoting machamp and gengar they're (71:00 - 71:05)
appearing more frequently in in raids (71:01 - 71:05)
so (71:05 - 71:09)
they've controlled that situation before (71:05 - 71:11)
and honestly if it wasn't for like the (71:09 - 71:14)
clock date switch thing (71:11 - 71:17)
people probably would have gotten (71:14 - 71:19)
more time out of the raid stuff because (71:17 - 71:20)
once people figured out oh i can just (71:19 - 71:22)
move my clock forward and like find the (71:20 - 71:25)
gmax kingler um it kind of like sucked (71:22 - 71:27)
all that like sense of discovery out of (71:25 - 71:29)
it (71:27 - 71:30)
uh (71:29 - 71:33)
but not only can they control (71:30 - 71:36)
which pokemon appear in which raid dens (71:33 - 71:38)
meaning they can they can say like yeah (71:36 - 71:41)
pikachu can be any type but pikachu only (71:38 - 71:44)
exists in ground type raid dens so right (71:41 - 71:46)
now you can only get electric pikachu (71:44 - 71:47)
you can only get flying pikachu from the (71:46 - 71:48)
distribution and you can only get ground (71:47 - 71:51)
type pikachu could there be a ice (71:48 - 71:53)
pikachu in the future yes but not right (71:51 - 71:54)
now because there's not a pikachu (71:53 - 71:58)
spawning in an ice type den (71:54 - 71:59)
so all of that aside i think there's (71:58 - 72:01)
enough proof and what i just explained (71:59 - 72:03)
for that to probably be the case but (72:01 - 72:06)
also they can use this for competitive (72:03 - 72:07)
they can say like (72:06 - 72:10)
the current ray den (72:07 - 72:13)
situation is how (72:10 - 72:15)
series 1 of competitive is going to be (72:13 - 72:17)
and now we're going to put (72:15 - 72:19)
charmander water type in raids that will (72:17 - 72:22)
be legal for series 2. now you've just (72:19 - 72:23)
slightly changed the metal like they've (72:22 - 72:25)
done before (72:23 - 72:27)
by introducing new pokemon in new raid (72:25 - 72:30)
type dens (72:27 - 72:30)
so i almost agree with you (72:31 - 72:38)
uh the one difference that i would say (72:34 - 72:39)
it's because i just i don't think that (72:38 - 72:41)
they plan that well (72:39 - 72:42)
um (72:41 - 72:43)
that (72:42 - 72:44)
yes (72:43 - 72:46)
you can get (72:44 - 72:48)
non-standard terror types of pokemon (72:46 - 72:50)
through raids that makes sense right (72:48 - 72:51)
like it's not it's not going to be your (72:50 - 72:53)
pokemon that are walking around it's (72:51 - 72:55)
going to be you're only going to get the (72:53 - 72:57)
special terror types in raids but i (72:55 - 72:58)
think what the way that they're going to (72:57 - 73:00)
do it (72:58 - 73:03)
is they're going to say like (73:00 - 73:05)
all right we're having (73:03 - 73:07)
a gardevoir raid weekend and that (73:05 - 73:09)
gardevoir could be any (73:07 - 73:12)
of the 18 and it's like you keep raiding (73:09 - 73:15)
until you find the terror type that you (73:12 - 73:17)
want gardevoir to have (73:15 - 73:20)
so yes they'll control which pokemon (73:17 - 73:22)
would be available for vgc but not the (73:20 - 73:25)
terra type (73:22 - 73:28)
so like all 18 possibilities would be (73:25 - 73:29)
available but only for that specific (73:28 - 73:33)
pokemon that was available as a raid (73:29 - 73:35)
i think though that like (73:33 - 73:37)
if they control both right (73:35 - 73:39)
we're controlling which terror types are (73:37 - 73:41)
existing (73:39 - 73:43)
per raids and which pokemon are spawning (73:41 - 73:44)
in the raids (73:43 - 73:47)
they they add more length to their own (73:44 - 73:49)
game (73:47 - 73:51)
like if you struggle to find (73:49 - 73:55)
gengar that first month of that game you (73:51 - 73:56)
would probably come back the second (73:55 - 73:58)
month because gengar is being promoted (73:56 - 74:01)
gigantomax gengar (73:58 - 74:03)
i think (74:01 - 74:06)
it behooves them to put all of i think (74:03 - 74:08)
that's the word of the show i think i (74:06 - 74:10)
think it behooves them to put all 18 (74:08 - 74:12)
types for let's just say this game has 4 (74:10 - 74:14)
400 pokemon (74:12 - 74:16)
400 times 18 is some (74:14 - 74:18)
very large number and if you're you're (74:16 - 74:20)
if you're a collector you'd be like (74:18 - 74:22)
that's super overwhelming even if you (74:20 - 74:24)
cared about one pokemon if you cared (74:22 - 74:26)
about specifically shinx and shinx has (74:24 - 74:27)
all 18 (74:26 - 74:29)
and you have to like (74:27 - 74:31)
weed through a bunch of pokemon you (74:29 - 74:32)
don't care about that's still a pretty (74:31 - 74:34)
overwhelming number where if they if (74:32 - 74:35)
they go like (74:34 - 74:38)
this week is water week all all the (74:35 - 74:40)
raids will be water (74:38 - 74:42)
and shrinks (74:40 - 74:43)
weasel (74:42 - 74:46)
starly are the featured pokemon in there (74:43 - 74:48)
it you could be like oh i want to come (74:46 - 74:49)
back for that week (74:48 - 74:50)
oh they're switching the raidens i want (74:49 - 74:53)
to come back oh there's a there's um (74:50 - 74:55)
there's a huge rotation this month i (74:53 - 74:56)
want to come back (74:55 - 74:59)
and they can kind of like drip feed it (74:56 - 75:01)
because they're they don't have to they (74:59 - 75:02)
don't have to make new pokemon they (75:01 - 75:03)
don't have to make new megas they don't (75:02 - 75:05)
have to make new gigantomax they just (75:03 - 75:06)
got to put a candle on its head and be (75:05 - 75:09)
like this one's fire now (75:06 - 75:09)
i mean they can do both right they can (75:10 - 75:13)
have like a raid weekend where you just (75:11 - 75:14)
it's like gardevoir week and all of the (75:13 - 75:16)
guard you have 18 types of gardevoir and (75:14 - 75:18)
go nuts or they can do like water week (75:16 - 75:20)
and you have 18 pokemon that can be (75:18 - 75:23)
water yeah yeah that is exactly what i (75:20 - 75:25)
was going to say (75:23 - 75:27)
yeah i just i agree i just don't think (75:25 - 75:28)
that this is like the hidden power (75:27 - 75:30)
situation i think that this is very (75:28 - 75:33)
controlled by them (75:30 - 75:34)
uh (75:33 - 75:35)
verse like what they're putting into the (75:34 - 75:37)
wild and what they're not sinisty is (75:35 - 75:41)
like a really good example too like (75:37 - 75:43)
you if you wanted authentic sinister (75:41 - 75:45)
when sword and shield first came out (75:43 - 75:47)
there were two places to hunt it (75:45 - 75:49)
one was in the forest through wild (75:47 - 75:50)
encounters (75:49 - 75:52)
and then the other was in the fog in the (75:50 - 75:55)
wild area like one day a week for like (75:52 - 75:56)
six hours (75:55 - 75:58)
like those are the only two places you (75:56 - 75:59)
could hunt it (75:58 - 76:00)
um you could breed it but you couldn't (75:59 - 76:02)
get authentic and then the crown tundra (76:00 - 76:03)
came out and gave you a third place to (76:02 - 76:04)
hunt it (76:03 - 76:07)
like they they control exactly which (76:04 - 76:09)
pokemon are spawning in which routes in (76:07 - 76:12)
which dens and (76:09 - 76:15)
so i i don't think they're i think i (76:12 - 76:16)
think there's probably more control to (76:15 - 76:18)
tear types than people (76:16 - 76:20)
think i don't think you're gonna start (76:18 - 76:22)
the game and be like i got all 18 eevs (76:20 - 76:23)
within the first hour i just i just (76:22 - 76:25)
don't think that's happening (76:23 - 76:27)
because i would assume that evie is in (76:25 - 76:28)
raids and we don't even know if evie (76:27 - 76:30)
will be in raids (76:28 - 76:32)
that being said if anybody has a steel (76:30 - 76:35)
terra type phalanx i'm looking to trade (76:32 - 76:39)
i mean i need one thanks (76:35 - 76:39)
i i and for the battles battle stuff um (76:41 - 76:48)
competitively i think there is a lot of (76:46 - 76:51)
value to like you being (76:48 - 76:54)
water fairy and then just changing your (76:51 - 76:56)
type specifically to water (76:54 - 76:58)
um that would be the azumarill they (76:56 - 76:59)
showed (76:58 - 77:01)
like oh no i'm there's a poison pokemon (76:59 - 77:03)
across for me (77:01 - 77:04)
i'm just gonna drop the ferry type go (77:03 - 77:07)
pure water now i'm not now that poison (77:04 - 77:08)
type's not super effective against me (77:07 - 77:10)
it's just neutral (77:08 - 77:13)
uh there's definitely value there (77:10 - 77:14)
and (77:13 - 77:16)
i think this feeds into like them (77:14 - 77:19)
controlling the types if you know that (77:16 - 77:22)
pikachu is only electric flying ground (77:19 - 77:23)
if you're playing competitive and (77:22 - 77:25)
there's a pikachu in front of you (77:23 - 77:26)
now you don't go (77:25 - 77:28)
oh gosh there's 18 which one is this (77:26 - 77:30)
pikachu you go this because either (77:28 - 77:33)
electric flying or ground like those are (77:30 - 77:34)
the three options well (77:33 - 77:37)
so my question which i don't see an (77:34 - 77:38)
answer for (77:37 - 77:42)
is does terrastilizing (77:38 - 77:45)
change the pokemon's type (77:42 - 77:49)
or does it just give it an enhancement (77:45 - 77:52)
it it does say it changes its type (77:49 - 77:53)
where (77:52 - 77:54)
oh gosh (77:53 - 77:56)
all pokemon can terracilize to gain (77:54 - 77:58)
special powers and terrestrialization (77:56 - 78:00)
allows players to enhance their battle (77:58 - 78:02)
strategies by increasing the power of (78:00 - 78:04)
any moves that have the same type as (78:02 - 78:06)
their pokemon's terror type (78:04 - 78:08)
there are 18 types meaning there are (78:06 - 78:10)
countless combinations of pokemon and (78:08 - 78:11)
terror (78:10 - 78:13)
same being your pokemon's weakness it's (78:11 - 78:14)
the next sentence (78:13 - 78:17)
[Music] (78:14 - 78:19)
yeah (78:17 - 78:21)
that's not a press release that's how (78:19 - 78:23)
they tricked me yeah it's not in the (78:21 - 78:24)
press really i don't know why the press (78:23 - 78:26)
release on the website have like (78:24 - 78:29)
slightly different (78:26 - 78:29)
um okay and then they brought back raid (78:30 - 78:34)
battles (78:33 - 78:35)
so this will be our last part of the (78:34 - 78:37)
tara this was the thing out of all like (78:35 - 78:39)
i thought the trailer was good i thought (78:37 - 78:41)
the whole presents was good but man them (78:39 - 78:44)
bringing back raid battles i was like no (78:41 - 78:45)
way (78:44 - 78:46)
that was the thing i was super worried (78:45 - 78:48)
about in sword and shield i was like i (78:46 - 78:50)
think ray battles are so great i think (78:48 - 78:53)
the the just the the thought process of (78:50 - 78:55)
four people battling one pokemon that's (78:53 - 78:57)
supposed to be a little bit challenging (78:55 - 78:59)
um you know it turns out it didn't end (78:57 - 79:00)
up being that challenging but it was (78:59 - 79:02)
still fun (79:00 - 79:03)
uh look animal crossing's not (79:02 - 79:06)
challenging still fun (79:03 - 79:08)
uh well you know maybe paying off your (79:06 - 79:10)
debt to tom nook a little challenging (79:08 - 79:10)
but (79:10 - 79:12)
like (79:10 - 79:13)
things don't have to be super hard to be (79:12 - 79:16)
fun and i thought raid battles were just (79:13 - 79:18)
an absolute delight i thought dynamaxx (79:16 - 79:20)
venture was an absolute divide delight (79:18 - 79:22)
even like failing a dynamics adventure (79:20 - 79:24)
and being like ah we didn't get that (79:22 - 79:25)
zapdos but we got three other pokemon (79:24 - 79:27)
let's try and check those still super (79:25 - 79:29)
fun and i was like (79:27 - 79:32)
if they get rid of raids what like four (79:29 - 79:33)
player activity are they going to give (79:32 - 79:35)
us and they were like you know what no (79:33 - 79:36)
we're just gonna bring back raids again (79:35 - 79:38)
it's slightly different because like not (79:36 - 79:39)
dynamics but like (79:38 - 79:42)
very into this um i think (79:39 - 79:44)
i think like (79:42 - 79:46)
they hit it out of the park with raids (79:44 - 79:50)
for sword and shield as like a fun thing (79:46 - 79:53)
that they shouldn't have cut and i think (79:50 - 79:54)
that's the thing with a generation of (79:53 - 79:56)
pokemon is like (79:54 - 79:58)
going back to megas people loved megas (79:56 - 79:59)
and then they cut it (79:58 - 80:01)
and then people were like i want megan's (79:59 - 80:03)
back and that's kind of like (80:01 - 80:05)
raids are great (80:03 - 80:07)
like if you cut it what are you (80:05 - 80:08)
replacing it with because at least megas (80:07 - 80:10)
were replaced with z crystals replaced (80:08 - 80:12)
with giant max replaced with another (80:10 - 80:14)
gimmick but like (80:12 - 80:16)
if you just want us to race bikes around (80:14 - 80:18)
this world that's not the same as like (80:16 - 80:20)
cooperating to like take down a hard (80:18 - 80:22)
boss (80:20 - 80:24)
yeah i agree i really like the rate (80:22 - 80:26)
system as well um and if you're somebody (80:24 - 80:28)
that likes pokemon but you don't like (80:26 - 80:29)
battling there's like not a lot of (80:28 - 80:31)
multiplayer stuff you can do in pokemon (80:29 - 80:33)
aside from like trading um and i think (80:31 - 80:35)
that the raid battles are like a really (80:33 - 80:38)
really good co-op mode um yeah so i'm (80:35 - 80:40)
glad that they brought it back (80:38 - 80:42)
yeah and it it also (80:40 - 80:45)
ties into like that that grooky story (80:42 - 80:47)
like hey i i leveled up my groupie it (80:45 - 80:49)
has the hidden ability now it has good (80:47 - 80:51)
ivs i'm gonna use him in raids like i (80:49 - 80:52)
don't have to use him competitively but (80:51 - 80:55)
now he's at least good against (80:52 - 80:57)
all of the weasel raids that i'm about (80:55 - 81:00)
to do when grassy glide that weasel the (80:57 - 81:02)
back and forth (81:00 - 81:02)
uh they did say that the battle system (81:05 - 81:09)
has a time limit and allows players to (81:07 - 81:11)
continue to attack seamlessly without (81:09 - 81:13)
waiting for other trainers to choose (81:11 - 81:14)
their actions (81:13 - 81:15)
um (81:14 - 81:18)
so that is new that is different i don't (81:15 - 81:21)
know the extent of what that means (81:18 - 81:23)
like so if you remember in raid battles (81:21 - 81:25)
everybody would plug in their move and (81:23 - 81:27)
then based on the speed of the pokemon (81:25 - 81:29)
it would determine the order that the (81:27 - 81:31)
moves would go off (81:29 - 81:33)
no more (81:31 - 81:37)
i i put in my move my move goes (81:33 - 81:39)
is this like a final fantasy thing where (81:37 - 81:40)
like you hit the move and then you have (81:39 - 81:42)
like cool down and when it gets to the (81:40 - 81:44)
end you do it again i mean i don't know (81:42 - 81:45)
if there's a cool down or what that (81:44 - 81:47)
makes sense because it makes sense like (81:45 - 81:49)
a faster pokemon would have a shorter (81:47 - 81:50)
cooldown (81:49 - 81:52)
but it's like (81:50 - 81:54)
everybody doesn't have to plug in their (81:52 - 81:57)
moves it's just like whenever you are (81:54 - 81:59)
ready to do your move you do it ready (81:57 - 82:01)
and can and ready and able to do your (81:59 - 82:03)
move you do it (82:01 - 82:05)
so would that be more like in pokemon go (82:03 - 82:07)
raid battles where everyone's just like (82:05 - 82:09)
tap in (82:07 - 82:14)
yeah go off simultaneously right (82:09 - 82:14)
uh they said to have a battle uh (82:16 - 82:20)
together with friends uh a player will (82:18 - 82:22)
already need to know or set the link (82:20 - 82:23)
code (82:22 - 82:26)
so we'll see if they figure that out oh (82:23 - 82:30)
if they can please fix that (82:26 - 82:30)
uh we can only hope the y-com will be (82:30 - 82:33)
better (82:32 - 82:34)
uh there are some other multiplayer (82:33 - 82:36)
stuff in pokemon scarlet and violet (82:34 - 82:37)
players can trade with players players (82:36 - 82:39)
can trade and battle with trainers all (82:37 - 82:41)
over the world using a feature called (82:39 - 82:44)
the pokey portal (82:41 - 82:46)
in the pokey portal a link trade lets (82:44 - 82:48)
players trade with a specific pokemon (82:46 - 82:50)
surprise trade is returning after (82:48 - 82:52)
choosing a pokemon to trade the player (82:50 - 82:53)
will be able to trade with a random (82:52 - 82:55)
trainer somewhere in the world (82:53 - 82:58)
battling option in the pokey portal uh (82:55 - 83:00)
players will also have to pokemon (82:58 - 83:03)
battles with other pokemon trainers (83:00 - 83:06)
additionally with the new union circle (83:03 - 83:09)
added to the pokey portal a player and (83:06 - 83:11)
three friends can adventure together in (83:09 - 83:13)
the same space it doesn't (83:11 - 83:16)
specifically say if (83:13 - 83:18)
i'm riding my bike with will (83:16 - 83:21)
and greg if i can just stop and then (83:18 - 83:23)
trade will and then get back on the bike (83:21 - 83:25)
and still go or if we have to go to the (83:23 - 83:27)
designated spot (83:25 - 83:28)
um (83:27 - 83:31)
the pokey portal spot to link trade or (83:28 - 83:33)
or whatnot doesn't really say (83:31 - 83:34)
um (83:33 - 83:36)
we also don't know what happens when (83:34 - 83:38)
like (83:36 - 83:38)
will and i see a young goose on our (83:39 - 83:43)
bikes and i run into the young goose (83:41 - 83:46)
does we'll see that battle does will (83:43 - 83:48)
participate in that battle does will run (83:46 - 83:50)
into the young goose and get a different (83:48 - 83:52)
young goose (83:50 - 83:54)
like it they haven't shown or talked (83:52 - 83:57)
about that yet yeah but the multiplayer (83:54 - 83:58)
is (83:57 - 84:01)
still vague (83:58 - 84:02)
yeah i mean it could be kind of like (84:01 - 84:04)
animal crossing where they just turn off (84:02 - 84:05)
some functionality when people are at (84:04 - 84:08)
your island so like when somebody comes (84:05 - 84:09)
maybe like (84:08 - 84:10)
they (84:09 - 84:12)
i guess i guess they wouldn't turn off (84:10 - 84:13)
wild pokemon encounters they could i (84:12 - 84:15)
don't know (84:13 - 84:17)
they absolutely could they absolutely (84:15 - 84:18)
could it's like (84:17 - 84:21)
they could change it to grass encounters (84:18 - 84:23)
like random (84:21 - 84:24)
which would be (84:23 - 84:26)
bad do you think it's gonna be like (84:24 - 84:27)
animal crossing where it takes like two (84:26 - 84:28)
hours to get to somebody's island you (84:27 - 84:30)
gotta like wait for the gates to close (84:28 - 84:32)
and then let the plane fly over and (84:30 - 84:34)
you're like (84:32 - 84:36)
no i could see it be like you kids are (84:34 - 84:38)
making too much noise so all the pokemon (84:36 - 84:40)
that were running out that you could see (84:38 - 84:42)
have gone to hide in the grass so if you (84:40 - 84:43)
want to find pokemon you've got to go (84:42 - 84:45)
into the grass (84:43 - 84:46)
i imagine though i (84:45 - 84:48)
i think it would be hard to do the (84:46 - 84:50)
logistics of like co-op battles of wild (84:48 - 84:51)
pokemon because then like who who gets (84:50 - 84:53)
to catch it do you both get to catch it (84:51 - 84:56)
yeah because that that's like well (84:53 - 84:58)
raids are the thing right so then would (84:56 - 84:59)
they like (84:58 - 85:01)
um would they make the pokemon harder (84:59 - 85:03)
then if you have like more people would (85:01 - 85:04)
you get higher level pokemon so that (85:03 - 85:06)
you're not just like (85:04 - 85:07)
four people taking down a level six (85:06 - 85:10)
young goose (85:07 - 85:11)
we could all make at the same time we (85:10 - 85:14)
could all mega are a spirit (85:11 - 85:16)
it's gonna be like monster hunter i can (85:14 - 85:18)
see it now where it's like i (85:16 - 85:21)
need for this monster to die i've got to (85:18 - 85:22)
kill this monster and then some other (85:21 - 85:24)
dude's like i said a trap (85:22 - 85:26)
and i trapped it i was like no i didn't (85:24 - 85:28)
need it trapped (85:26 - 85:30)
the only the only thing they seem to (85:28 - 85:32)
like solidify (85:30 - 85:34)
without saying it is that you'll be able (85:32 - 85:36)
to race each other like that seemed like (85:34 - 85:38)
a very (85:36 - 85:39)
like they didn't say like you'll be able (85:38 - 85:43)
to like actually have like (85:39 - 85:43)
i think in destiny (85:43 - 85:49)
when when i would play with will or or (85:46 - 85:52)
irene like we could just say like who's (85:49 - 85:53)
going to get from point a to point b the (85:52 - 85:56)
fastest like we could like make our own (85:53 - 85:57)
fun (85:56 - 85:59)
we could be like let's let's race to the (85:57 - 86:01)
the the space base (85:59 - 86:03)
and then we jump on our cars and we get (86:01 - 86:06)
there so like in scarlet violet you (86:03 - 86:08)
could be like okay let's race to the (86:06 - 86:11)
next town on our weird motorcycle bikes (86:08 - 86:13)
but i do think that there there has to (86:11 - 86:15)
be like (86:13 - 86:17)
talk to this person this person will be (86:15 - 86:19)
like let's set up a race and then there (86:17 - 86:22)
will be an actual like (86:19 - 86:22)
[Music] (86:23 - 86:27)
i mean even destiny did introduce racing (86:24 - 86:29)
eventually yeah so yeah they eventually (86:27 - 86:30)
did (86:29 - 86:32)
if you can race does that mean the speed (86:30 - 86:34)
of your bike depends on like the stats (86:32 - 86:37)
of your pokemon like (86:34 - 86:39)
like how what's gonna if if everyone has (86:37 - 86:40)
a bike that goes the same speed how are (86:39 - 86:41)
you going to race like what's going to (86:40 - 86:43)
determine (86:41 - 86:46)
differences the the tight cornering (86:43 - 86:47)
yeah i think it's getting the apex of (86:46 - 86:49)
every turn along those lines where it's (86:47 - 86:51)
like it's like the balloons in legends (86:49 - 86:54)
arceus or like or in sword and shield (86:51 - 86:56)
they had the balloon right they had the (86:54 - 86:59)
balloons too right um or something where (86:56 - 87:02)
you can like uh (86:59 - 87:03)
if there there might be something on the (87:02 - 87:05)
course where if you hit it (87:03 - 87:08)
like your pokemon goes faster (87:05 - 87:10)
okay or it's in sword and shield if you (87:08 - 87:13)
hit it you would like spin out (87:10 - 87:13)
so they've done racing before they just (87:13 - 87:17)
haven't done (87:15 - 87:20)
group racing (87:17 - 87:20)
okay one more break (87:20 - 87:23)
uh when we get back we're going to talk (87:22 - 87:25)
about the three new pokemon and (87:23 - 87:28)
[Music] (87:25 - 87:30)
i had the the (87:28 - 87:32)
weird legendaries so we (87:30 - 87:35)
will be right back (87:32 - 87:39)
and we are back from our break (87:35 - 87:41)
in addition to new regional pokemon (87:39 - 87:43)
found across both scarlet and violet (87:41 - 87:45)
different species will appear (87:43 - 87:47)
depending on which game the player (87:45 - 87:50)
purchases for example larvitar and stone (87:47 - 87:53)
journal will appear in scarlet and bagon (87:50 - 87:55)
and ice cube will appear in violet so we (87:53 - 87:57)
know which one (87:55 - 87:59)
penguin's getting (87:57 - 88:01)
i actually think i'm getting scarlet (87:59 - 88:03)
because my big brother always gets dibs (88:01 - 88:05)
on which game he wants and he wants the (88:03 - 88:07)
purple one so (88:05 - 88:09)
i think i get the red one so now you (88:07 - 88:11)
gotta trade for the ice cube yep that's (88:09 - 88:14)
the way that works (88:11 - 88:16)
uh (88:14 - 88:18)
okay so they show three new pokemon the (88:16 - 88:21)
first one is fido (88:18 - 88:25)
fido skin has elastic qualities (88:21 - 88:26)
and (88:25 - 88:30)
is both firm and soft at the same time (88:26 - 88:32)
when these pokemon become excited they (88:30 - 88:34)
intimidate their opponents by puffing up (88:32 - 88:36)
their bodies to appear bigger (88:34 - 88:40)
phyto ferments things in its vicinity (88:36 - 88:43)
using the yeast in its breath the yeast (88:40 - 88:45)
is useful for cooking so the pokemon has (88:43 - 88:48)
been protected by people since long ago (88:45 - 88:51)
it is the puppy pokemon it is fairy type (88:48 - 88:54)
as the ability own tempo (88:51 - 88:56)
so the popular cooking dude is going to (88:54 - 88:58)
have one of these right because he's (88:56 - 88:59)
going to get his dog to breathe on (88:58 - 89:02)
everything and yep that makes sense yeah (88:59 - 89:04)
i didn't think about that yeah (89:02 - 89:06)
um do you think the cooking dude's going (89:04 - 89:08)
to have like appleton and like (89:06 - 89:10)
vanillish and you think he's they're (89:08 - 89:12)
gonna do the gimmick that would imply (89:10 - 89:15)
that he's like eating those pokemon (89:12 - 89:16)
yeah it has to be the pokemon that help (89:15 - 89:19)
you cook yeah not the pokemon just like (89:16 - 89:21)
he could just like food so much that he (89:19 - 89:23)
has an appleton he doesn't have to eat (89:21 - 89:24)
the appleton but if he likes food so (89:23 - 89:26)
much wouldn't he just be like thinking (89:24 - 89:29)
about eating the appleton the whole time (89:26 - 89:29)
yeah (89:29 - 89:33)
i do have a declaration to make (89:31 - 89:37)
okay if you have gone gluten-free in (89:33 - 89:39)
your life (89:37 - 89:42)
you cannot have a fido (89:39 - 89:46)
sorry you can have gluten-free bread (89:42 - 89:49)
you cannot have elastic qualities in (89:46 - 89:52)
gluten-free bread i love bread (89:49 - 89:54)
i had like (89:52 - 89:56)
six crazy crazy sticks breadsticks (89:54 - 89:58)
before i went to bed last night do you (89:56 - 90:00)
want to understand this here (89:58 - 90:03)
understand how much steve loves bread we (90:00 - 90:05)
went to lunch together yesterday he (90:03 - 90:06)
orders like a full (90:05 - 90:10)
breakfast plate bacon eggs sourdough (90:06 - 90:12)
toast (90:10 - 90:15)
he ate the toast (90:12 - 90:15)
he like maybe had half a bacon and a (90:17 - 90:20)
scoop of eggs (90:19 - 90:23)
he ate the toast i messed up with the (90:20 - 90:25)
eggs because i love scrambled eggs but (90:23 - 90:28)
then i forget to ask them ask them to (90:25 - 90:30)
get them well done and then most (90:28 - 90:32)
restaurants scramble eggs are like (90:30 - 90:36)
really runny and i hate it (90:32 - 90:39)
like i don't want soupy eggs i want i (90:36 - 90:41)
want a little brown i want my eggs to be (90:39 - 90:44)
a little brown (90:41 - 90:44)
anyways speaking of brown (90:44 - 90:53)
[Laughter] (90:47 - 90:53)
whooper in ancient times whooper lived (91:01 - 91:07)
uh underwater in the paldea region (91:04 - 91:09)
after losing its struggle for territory (91:07 - 91:12)
it seems they began living in bogs on (91:09 - 91:14)
the land to keep them from drying out (91:12 - 91:15)
living on land they began to cover their (91:14 - 91:18)
bodies with a poisonous film their gills (91:15 - 91:20)
have hardened thanks to living on land (91:18 - 91:22)
for so long their bar bodies are heavy (91:20 - 91:24)
and they move slowly but they can (91:22 - 91:26)
protect themselves by shooting powerful (91:24 - 91:29)
poisonous liquid from their gills (91:26 - 91:30)
this is what i was talking about earlier (91:29 - 91:32)
the lore (91:30 - 91:34)
good deep (91:32 - 91:35)
there will be nothing in the story to (91:34 - 91:38)
ever signify what (91:35 - 91:41)
caused them to like lose their territory (91:38 - 91:43)
i mean look at them they're like they're (91:41 - 91:45)
they're so anything could beat a whooper (91:43 - 91:47)
out for territory (91:45 - 91:49)
true true (91:47 - 91:52)
they got no arms (91:49 - 91:52)
they're the poison fish pokemon they're (91:52 - 91:56)
poison ground type they have the (91:54 - 91:59)
abilities poison point and water absorb (91:56 - 92:01)
actually really good water absorb there (91:59 - 92:02)
because ground is weak to water (92:01 - 92:05)
um you suck up all the water so (92:02 - 92:07)
i guess we'll see if if that actually is (92:05 - 92:10)
good competitively (92:07 - 92:12)
and then finally we have sid titan (92:10 - 92:15)
so titan have tough muscles to support (92:12 - 92:17)
their immense bodies and physical (92:15 - 92:18)
attacks using their bodies have (92:17 - 92:21)
incredible power they migrated around (92:18 - 92:22)
the snowy regions protected by a thick (92:21 - 92:25)
layer of fat they're known as the terra (92:22 - 92:27)
whale pokemon they're pure ice type (92:25 - 92:29)
they have the ability thick fat and (92:27 - 92:31)
slush rush (92:29 - 92:35)
where does the names of titan come from (92:31 - 92:35)
sea titan like uh (92:35 - 92:41)
like sea is in the water i'm looking for (92:38 - 92:42)
oh (92:41 - 92:46)
where does the names to titan come from (92:42 - 92:46)
from a greek god (92:46 - 92:53)
in bellevue washington oh you are ah (92:48 - 92:53)
you have shamed your ancestors (92:53 - 92:59)
the scientific name for whales is (92:56 - 93:00)
cetacean (92:59 - 93:02)
oh (93:00 - 93:03)
so (93:02 - 93:06)
yes it is where did that come from (93:03 - 93:09)
well okay fine (93:06 - 93:13)
they may have a latinate orient origin (93:09 - 93:13)
it's cool that people are like i i think (93:16 - 93:21)
i think all these pokemon are great (93:19 - 93:25)
so titan solidifies that like (93:21 - 93:27)
i like the goofy dumb looking pokemon (93:25 - 93:30)
more than like the cool serious pokemon (93:27 - 93:34)
like i get why people like titan um just (93:30 - 93:36)
he's not derpy enough for me on first (93:34 - 93:38)
view i thought he was just like a big (93:36 - 93:40)
squishy ball and i liked that but he's (93:38 - 93:44)
like hard and spiky which i like less (93:40 - 93:47)
a very spiky land whale (93:44 - 93:48)
yeah (93:47 - 93:50)
yeah i also like the derpy pokemon he (93:48 - 93:54)
makes some fun faces though (93:50 - 93:54)
do you think uh we're gonna get like (93:54 - 93:59)
ball fetch back because when i saw fido (93:56 - 94:00)
i was like oh what if it had ball fetch (93:59 - 94:02)
like ampere that'd be great because like (94:00 - 94:04)
yamper's ability is incredible it's it's (94:02 - 94:06)
like i've (94:04 - 94:08)
in my 2000 plus hours of sword and (94:06 - 94:10)
shield i almost always have a yamper on (94:08 - 94:12)
my team because if you like find a shiny (94:10 - 94:13)
pokemon or something and you like throw (94:12 - 94:15)
a front ball at it and like it breaks (94:13 - 94:16)
out you can like switch in the emperor (94:15 - 94:18)
get your friend ball back it's like (94:16 - 94:20)
crazy good (94:18 - 94:22)
um and it's the only pokemon out of (94:20 - 94:24)
almost a thousand pokemon that have that (94:22 - 94:25)
ability (94:24 - 94:26)
and i was like (94:25 - 94:28)
own tempo (94:26 - 94:30)
what a garbage ability no one wants that (94:28 - 94:32)
oh no one wants to own tempo give it (94:30 - 94:33)
give it the ball fetch (94:32 - 94:36)
it's a dog (94:33 - 94:38)
then your your balls always gonna be all (94:36 - 94:40)
yeasty when it brings it back yeah yeah (94:38 - 94:43)
exactly (94:40 - 94:45)
isn't that like just the acceptance you (94:43 - 94:47)
have as a dog owner is your dog always (94:45 - 94:50)
has bad breath anyways (94:47 - 94:50)
dogs don't have bad breath (94:51 - 94:55)
what (94:54 - 94:57)
i mean some do but if you brush your (94:55 - 94:58)
dog's teeth (94:57 - 95:00)
if you feed it the right food and brush (94:58 - 95:02)
its teeth it's not going to have bad (95:00 - 95:04)
breath (95:02 - 95:04)
new forms discovered for legendary (95:06 - 95:11)
pokemon korydon and miraidon (95:08 - 95:13)
did we say on the show like like the the (95:11 - 95:16)
end of its name is like ride on (95:13 - 95:19)
like riding on (95:16 - 95:21)
just in case like no one got the pun (95:19 - 95:22)
there (95:21 - 95:23)
um (95:22 - 95:25)
players will meet legendary pokemon (95:23 - 95:27)
either co-ride on or me right on (95:25 - 95:29)
and it will join them on their journey (95:27 - 95:31)
karaidon and miradan are full of mystery (95:29 - 95:33)
and said to have powers that far surpass (95:31 - 95:35)
that of other pokemon these pokemon (95:33 - 95:37)
change forms to suit to better suit what (95:35 - 95:39)
they are doing on what terrain they are (95:37 - 95:41)
traveling over there is a sprinting (95:39 - 95:43)
build slash drive mode players can ride (95:41 - 95:46)
sprinting build core ride on or drive (95:43 - 95:48)
mode me ride on to make it easier to (95:46 - 95:50)
traverse the expansive paldeo region (95:48 - 95:52)
more freely there is swimming build (95:50 - 95:54)
aquatic mode (95:52 - 95:55)
players will be able to jump into rivers (95:54 - 95:57)
lakes and vibrant vibrant oceans to (95:55 - 96:00)
approach pokemon that live on the (95:57 - 96:02)
uh live there or cross perilous waters (96:00 - 96:05)
in by snapping by (96:02 - 96:07)
either using swimming build korydon or (96:05 - 96:10)
aqua mode miraidon (96:07 - 96:11)
and there's gliding (96:10 - 96:14)
glide mode players can travel mountains (96:11 - 96:16)
cliffs or tall buildings by gliding (96:14 - 96:17)
towards their destination they they (96:16 - 96:19)
don't have fancy names for them for them (96:17 - 96:20)
there (96:19 - 96:23)
they ran out of copy (96:20 - 96:25)
uh there's also in the trailer they show (96:23 - 96:27)
them like climbing straight up a (96:25 - 96:30)
mountain like sneezler does in (96:27 - 96:32)
in legends arceus but that's not listed (96:30 - 96:34)
here (96:32 - 96:37)
but they just straight up that (96:34 - 96:39)
mountain could be a little breath of the (96:37 - 96:41)
wild i don't know if there's like a (96:39 - 96:44)
stamina bar (96:41 - 96:46)
so i think that these legends in bike (96:44 - 96:48)
form look a little silly they're like so (96:46 - 96:50)
small and you just like sit on them and (96:48 - 96:53)
it's like this used to be a rotom but (96:50 - 96:55)
now it's your legendary but it does the (96:53 - 96:58)
exact same thing (96:55 - 96:58)
yeah also you would have to get them (96:58 - 97:04)
pretty early right like that yes they (97:01 - 97:05)
just make you grind through the first (97:04 - 97:06)
half of the game (97:05 - 97:10)
no but that was the surprise to me so (97:06 - 97:11)
yes (97:10 - 97:13)
the surprise to me was the fact that (97:11 - 97:15)
it's like you're gonna get the legendary (97:13 - 97:18)
at the beginning of the game (97:15 - 97:20)
it's a good twist you know honestly like (97:18 - 97:22)
why not try it (97:20 - 97:24)
it's the it's like a (97:22 - 97:28)
like a vaccine it's the weakened form of (97:24 - 97:30)
the legendary it's not gonna reach full (97:28 - 97:33)
power until you unlock the mystery later (97:30 - 97:35)
in the game so you could use it as a (97:33 - 97:38)
bike but not as a pokemon until you yeah (97:35 - 97:39)
that's what i think too game on powers i (97:38 - 97:41)
don't think you can use it as a pokemon (97:39 - 97:42)
pokemon (97:41 - 97:44)
do you think it's the treasure you've (97:42 - 97:46)
been riding on the treasure the entire (97:44 - 97:47)
time (97:46 - 97:50)
no the treasure's in the eevee backpack (97:47 - 97:52)
oh yeah yeah yeah the treasure is the (97:50 - 97:54)
adventure you had along the way (97:52 - 97:57)
i'll be so mad if that's the treasure (97:54 - 97:58)
somebody at the pokemon company like (97:57 - 98:00)
finally got around to watching one piece (97:58 - 98:02)
and they're like i like that let's put (98:00 - 98:04)
that in our game (98:02 - 98:07)
let's find the one piece (98:04 - 98:09)
um (98:07 - 98:09)
i (98:10 - 98:15)
love that corridon has wheels but then (98:11 - 98:16)
runs on all four (98:15 - 98:21)
i'm very into it it's so dumb and i i i (98:16 - 98:24)
was i was on team maridon from the start (98:21 - 98:26)
i was like he looks cooler has like a (98:24 - 98:29)
spacier theme love the color purple and (98:26 - 98:31)
then they showed the they just shook a (98:29 - 98:34)
ride on like not using his wheels and (98:31 - 98:36)
i'm like i'm in i think they've made him (98:34 - 98:38)
better (98:36 - 98:38)
arguable (98:39 - 98:44)
i mean i i didn't even pay attention to (98:41 - 98:46)
it because i was just focused on (98:44 - 98:50)
one the one that mattered to me (98:46 - 98:50)
um yeah i i do think it's interesting (98:51 - 98:55)
for them to be like here's the legend so (98:53 - 98:56)
early (98:55 - 98:58)
assuming that you i mean you get the (98:56 - 99:02)
bike before the second gym in (98:58 - 99:04)
sword and shield you can't traverse (99:02 - 99:06)
water until after (99:04 - 99:08)
the sixth gym if i remember correctly (99:06 - 99:10)
before piers (99:08 - 99:11)
um but you do get the bike relatively (99:10 - 99:14)
early in most pokemon games (99:11 - 99:17)
i i would be curious if (99:14 - 99:19)
so so something that's probably not (99:17 - 99:20)
going to happen (99:19 - 99:23)
that we've learned from legends arceus (99:20 - 99:24)
but (99:23 - 99:26)
we can be hopeful like what happens when (99:24 - 99:28)
you own both games (99:26 - 99:30)
and i trade my miradon into my copy of (99:28 - 99:32)
scarlet (99:30 - 99:36)
can i opt to ride him instead of miradon (99:32 - 99:39)
because i now own both is that is (99:36 - 99:41)
probably not but why not (99:39 - 99:43)
that makes sense because when i caught a (99:41 - 99:44)
shiny (99:43 - 99:47)
weird deer in legends arceus i was (99:44 - 99:50)
restricted to ride my non-shiny weird (99:47 - 99:55)
ear because you were riding the sacred (99:50 - 99:58)
pokemon out of the clan not just any (99:55 - 100:01)
weird ear off the block (99:58 - 100:02)
that's a big difference (100:01 - 100:04)
what's the name of my new band weird (100:02 - 100:06)
deer off the block (100:04 - 100:09)
so if you like transfer your your dragon (100:06 - 100:11)
bike dude into home do you just have to (100:09 - 100:13)
walk everywhere from then on (100:11 - 100:15)
oh yeah that's a good question too that (100:13 - 100:17)
was a thing in sun and moon though if (100:15 - 100:20)
you got rid of your lunala or your (100:17 - 100:21)
sogaleo (100:20 - 100:23)
you couldn't use them to change the (100:21 - 100:25)
portal (100:23 - 100:28)
so like i i left (100:25 - 100:31)
a solgaleo lunala in my copy of ultra (100:28 - 100:32)
because it was like well if i go back to (100:31 - 100:33)
these games and then i need to change (100:32 - 100:35)
like the time of day (100:33 - 100:38)
with the portal i i you need those (100:35 - 100:40)
pokemon to change the portal (100:38 - 100:41)
so yeah i don't know that's a good (100:40 - 100:42)
question what (100:41 - 100:45)
what if you release your corridon and (100:42 - 100:49)
then you're like i i can't race anymore (100:45 - 100:50)
i let him be free (100:49 - 100:52)
all four legs can run (100:50 - 100:55)
but if you're like on an island and then (100:52 - 100:55)
you (100:55 - 100:57)
you get rid of your dragon does that (100:55 - 100:58)
mean you're just stranded on the island (100:57 - 101:00)
forever because you can't traverse the (100:58 - 101:02)
water (101:00 - 101:04)
well i do yeah well like i think that (101:02 - 101:06)
does go in part of (101:04 - 101:08)
like they it's probably not your pokemon (101:06 - 101:11)
until the end right right like (101:08 - 101:12)
but like if it is if it then becomes (101:11 - 101:14)
your pokemon at the end and then you (101:12 - 101:16)
release it do you just mad does it they (101:14 - 101:18)
just magically pop up for you to like (101:16 - 101:21)
fly around (101:18 - 101:23)
another question i have is (101:21 - 101:25)
can i ride different pokemon (101:23 - 101:27)
because if i'm going to race other (101:25 - 101:29)
people and all four of us own scarlet (101:27 - 101:33)
and we're all running on korydon (101:29 - 101:34)
what what what if i want to ride a le (101:33 - 101:38)
chunk what if i run ride like (101:34 - 101:40)
the whatever the evolution of fido is (101:38 - 101:42)
because that's probably a bigger dog to (101:40 - 101:46)
ride on hopefully not as lame as bolton (101:42 - 101:47)
i (101:46 - 101:48)
feel like you're not going to be able to (101:47 - 101:49)
ride other stuff i feel like they would (101:48 - 101:51)
have told us if you could the the video (101:49 - 101:56)
that we see it is miradons and coridons (101:51 - 101:58)
and also they made it like you can you (101:56 - 101:59)
can write it on the land you can write (101:58 - 102:01)
it in the water it can fly you can climb (101:59 - 102:03)
like it can do everything it sounds like (102:01 - 102:06)
so what a downgrade in legends we got (102:03 - 102:08)
like five creatures in this game we just (102:06 - 102:10)
got one (102:08 - 102:12)
yeah but this is open world (102:10 - 102:14)
and if we assume (102:12 - 102:17)
that there's a third one (102:14 - 102:18)
to be ferrous or chilled there was not a (102:17 - 102:20)
third doggo there was just weird (102:18 - 102:23)
skeleton dragon (102:20 - 102:24)
but if there's a third (102:23 - 102:27)
dragon thingy (102:24 - 102:29)
like a kirum (102:27 - 102:31)
can we ride that what if we catch that (102:29 - 102:32)
can we ride that (102:31 - 102:33)
no (102:32 - 102:34)
[Music] (102:33 - 102:35)
i'm gonna (102:34 - 102:38)
put my bet on no (102:35 - 102:38)
yeah (102:39 - 102:43)
i uh it's (102:41 - 102:46)
cool though i saw a tic tac of somebody (102:43 - 102:48)
being like (102:46 - 102:48)
the well the first problem is i said i (102:48 - 102:53)
saw a tick tock but they were like (102:50 - 102:56)
how have we advanced in pokemon worlds (102:53 - 102:57)
like in in galler we have like these (102:56 - 102:59)
trains and we have like these corvo (102:57 - 103:02)
night buses and and (102:59 - 103:03)
in this game we're just riding a (103:02 - 103:06)
legendary pokemon (103:03 - 103:08)
and i was like yeah that's like kind of (103:06 - 103:12)
a point but also like (103:08 - 103:13)
every (103:12 - 103:16)
game like like it it is true that (103:13 - 103:19)
different (103:16 - 103:19)
uh regions or different cities or (103:19 - 103:23)
different countries have different forms (103:21 - 103:25)
of transportation like (103:23 - 103:27)
america is very bad at trains japan is (103:25 - 103:29)
very good at trains (103:27 - 103:31)
so i think we should bring back the (103:29 - 103:33)
let's go like ride in on your little (103:31 - 103:34)
dude on the map i think that was the (103:33 - 103:37)
best pokemon riding experience yeah (103:34 - 103:40)
persian or an arcanine or snorlax or a (103:37 - 103:41)
haunter or onyx (103:40 - 103:43)
really (103:41 - 103:45)
let's go was good you could ride on a (103:43 - 103:48)
ride-on (103:45 - 103:48)
um (103:50 - 103:53)
bonuses announced there's a speckle (103:51 - 103:55)
special a speckle could be a speckle (103:53 - 103:57)
special pikachu by purchasing pokemon (103:55 - 103:59)
scarlett or violet players will receive (103:57 - 104:02)
a special in-game pikachu as a gift this (103:59 - 104:03)
pikachu will have two unique (104:02 - 104:05)
characteristics (104:03 - 104:07)
one it will know the move fly (104:05 - 104:10)
to its tarot type will be flying (104:07 - 104:12)
players can receive this gift by (104:10 - 104:14)
choosing uh get via internet mystery (104:12 - 104:19)
gift until february 28 2023 (104:14 - 104:21)
so i this (104:19 - 104:24)
goes back to my theory earlier (104:21 - 104:26)
that they can control terror types they (104:24 - 104:28)
specifically said that this flying (104:26 - 104:31)
pikachu will not be in the game at all (104:28 - 104:33)
that if you want flying terror type (104:31 - 104:34)
pikachu you need to get the special (104:33 - 104:37)
distribution so for the people that (104:34 - 104:38)
still believe (104:37 - 104:40)
hidden power is a thing (104:38 - 104:42)
it doesn't make sense because if you got (104:40 - 104:45)
hidden power flying they're clearly (104:42 - 104:47)
stating right here that (104:45 - 104:49)
this pikachu will be had tarot type (104:47 - 104:51)
flying and this is the only way to get (104:49 - 104:55)
that terror type flying um no amount of (104:51 - 104:57)
catching random pikachus is going to get (104:55 - 105:01)
you a terra type flying pikachu (104:57 - 105:03)
unless at the end of the game there's (105:01 - 105:05)
like some machine that you like punch (105:03 - 105:07)
the buttons in and then it changes the (105:05 - 105:09)
terrain well the turret (105:07 - 105:11)
what they're saying is the only way to (105:09 - 105:13)
get the only way to get the poke the (105:11 - 105:16)
pikachu that knows fly is through the (105:13 - 105:18)
distribution (105:16 - 105:20)
it sounds like pikachu has two unique (105:18 - 105:22)
characteristics (105:20 - 105:24)
well (105:22 - 105:26)
i'm just rating the website i'm i'm (105:24 - 105:28)
betting that the fly is the distribution (105:26 - 105:30)
part (105:28 - 105:32)
if players download the digital version (105:30 - 105:34)
of scarlet or violet (105:32 - 105:36)

ready to hear what your adventure set is (105:41 - 105:47)

no you'll get ten count them ten potions (105:48 - 105:56)
not one not two not three not four but (105:54 - 105:58)
five full heels (105:56 - 106:00)
if you think one revive is enough isn't (105:58 - 106:02)
enough you're correct they're giving you (106:00 - 106:03)
three (106:02 - 106:05)
ether who is she you're getting three of (106:03 - 106:06)
them (106:05 - 106:10)
rare candy a solid uno that's one for (106:06 - 106:13)
our non-for our non-spanish speakers and (106:10 - 106:16)
finally to round it all off you get one (106:13 - 106:17)
nugget (106:16 - 106:20)
that is what they call the adventure set (106:17 - 106:23)
that you can get for free (106:20 - 106:25)
if you download the ditch i should that (106:23 - 106:27)
should be an ad they should have paid me (106:25 - 106:29)
for this i've sold multiple digital (106:27 - 106:32)
copies now people are like 10 potions (106:29 - 106:34)
digital time all that authentic energy (106:32 - 106:37)
really sound like it thank you (106:34 - 106:39)
will this is for you (106:37 - 106:43)
doubtful the double pack bonus that's (106:39 - 106:45)
definitely not me as a special bonus for (106:43 - 106:48)
purchasing scarlet and violet double (106:45 - 106:50)
pack trainers will receive (106:48 - 106:54)
two codes one per game that will reward (106:50 - 106:57)
them with a hundred a hundred percent i (106:54 - 106:59)
knew the hundred pokemon pokeballs was (106:57 - 107:02)
coming somewhere (106:59 - 107:02)
no quick balls this time this is what (107:02 - 107:07)
you all get y'all y'all complain that (107:04 - 107:10)
the quick ball special pre-order bonus (107:07 - 107:12)
that they did for omega ruby that they (107:10 - 107:14)
did for sun and moon ultra sun and moon (107:12 - 107:16)
i'm pretty sure they did it for sword (107:14 - 107:18)
and shield you all complained that the (107:16 - 107:20)
quick ball we were getting zero quick (107:18 - 107:23)
balls this time around quick balls were (107:20 - 107:25)
were a vital tool (107:23 - 107:27)
to catch (107:25 - 107:29)
magnemites or whatever else appeared in (107:27 - 107:32)
that first area (107:29 - 107:32)
they just ruined it for everyone now (107:33 - 107:37)
nobody gets quick balls now no one is (107:34 - 107:38)
getting quick balls we're getting ten (107:37 - 107:41)
potions instead (107:38 - 107:41)
uh that (107:43 - 107:49)
is a lot of info that we covered uh i'm (107:45 - 107:52)
sure we're missing some stuff (107:49 - 107:53)
uh they showed a persian with a ring pop (107:52 - 107:55)
on its head i don't know what more you (107:53 - 107:57)
want (107:55 - 107:59)
um (107:57 - 108:01)
you can see the map this is an audio (107:59 - 108:03)
podcast but if you go look at the map (108:01 - 108:05)
and you zoom in you could probably (108:03 - 108:07)
figure out where all eight gyms are by (108:05 - 108:09)
zooming in (108:07 - 108:11)
um (108:09 - 108:11)
they did say there was eight gyms they (108:13 - 108:16)
did i guess we didn't say that they did (108:14 - 108:18)
say that there was eight gyms and they (108:16 - 108:20)
did say that you could battle the gyms (108:18 - 108:21)
in any order (108:20 - 108:24)
what they didn't say is are these gyms (108:21 - 108:27)
going to scale to your level (108:24 - 108:29)
um so what that means for i guess (108:27 - 108:31)
somebody (108:29 - 108:33)
who um (108:31 - 108:34)
might not (108:33 - 108:36)
be a hardcore video game player maybe (108:34 - 108:38)
they just enjoy pokemon uh (108:36 - 108:40)
that would mean like normally when you (108:38 - 108:41)
will do we'll do red and blue for (108:40 - 108:43)
example when you first get to brock i (108:41 - 108:45)
think he's uh level like 10 and 11 and (108:43 - 108:47)
then when you get to misty she's like 17 (108:45 - 108:49)
and 18 and then when you get to (108:47 - 108:51)
lieutenant surge he's like (108:49 - 108:53)
21 and 23 i think (108:51 - 108:56)
um so ideally like let's say you were (108:53 - 108:57)
doing kanto you could go to any gym you (108:56 - 109:00)
wanted you go to lieutenant surge and is (108:57 - 109:02)
he still going to be (109:00 - 109:06)
21 and 23 and that's your first gym you (109:02 - 109:08)
got to or are they going to say like (109:06 - 109:11)
well since you have no gym badges (109:08 - 109:13)
i guess that's how they would probably (109:11 - 109:14)
do it right they would register how many (109:13 - 109:16)
gym badges you have (109:14 - 109:17)
and they would say well you have zero (109:16 - 109:19)
gym badges so lieutenant search will be (109:17 - 109:21)
level 10 and 11. (109:19 - 109:24)
oh you have eight gym bat you have seven (109:21 - 109:28)
gym badges lieutenant surge is 56 and 57 (109:24 - 109:32)
now i think so that's going to work yeah (109:28 - 109:35)
we don't know if they're going to scale (109:32 - 109:38)
or there are games like oh this may be (109:35 - 109:39)
not a great example but the original (109:38 - 109:43)
legend of zelda on the nes (109:39 - 109:44)
you could (109:43 - 109:46)
go anywhere you wanted (109:44 - 109:49)
you could go to the hardest dungeon (109:46 - 109:51)
right away you would probably die a (109:49 - 109:52)
million times because you only have (109:51 - 109:54)
three hearts (109:52 - 109:56)
but you did not have to do those (109:54 - 109:58)
dungeons in that order (109:56 - 110:00)
um (109:58 - 110:01)
you could do dungeon one and then (110:00 - 110:03)
dungeon three and then dungeon four and (110:01 - 110:05)
then go back to dungeon two technically (110:03 - 110:07)
and (110:05 - 110:09)
that zelda game (110:07 - 110:11)
um they there was no scaling that didn't (110:09 - 110:13)
make it easier because you went to a (110:11 - 110:15)
different dungeon in a different order (110:13 - 110:16)
so (110:15 - 110:17)
i think (110:16 - 110:19)
that everyone would want the level (110:17 - 110:21)
scaling i think that makes sense they've (110:19 - 110:22)
they definitely showed that in that one (110:21 - 110:25)
anime where (110:22 - 110:26)
um (110:25 - 110:29)
was that pokemon origins where like yeah (110:26 - 110:31)
brock has like multiple pokemon but he (110:29 - 110:33)
only chooses based off the fact that (110:31 - 110:36)
red has no badges (110:33 - 110:38)
um (110:36 - 110:39)
i don't as (110:38 - 110:41)
as nice as that provides variety and (110:39 - 110:43)
gives you your own sense of exploration (110:41 - 110:45)
and there is something nice about like (110:43 - 110:47)
well i'm here and i traveled all the way (110:45 - 110:48)
here i would like to do the gym instead (110:47 - 110:50)
of backtracking i don't know if that (110:48 - 110:54)
makes the game drastically better i mean (110:50 - 110:56)
and the reason i say that is because at (110:54 - 110:58)
one point in a game called black and (110:56 - 111:00)
white they were like (110:58 - 111:01)
sorry (111:00 - 111:04)
not black and white it was um x and y (111:01 - 111:06)
they were like you can battle the elite (111:04 - 111:08)
four in any order (111:06 - 111:09)
cool (111:08 - 111:10)
um (111:09 - 111:12)
doesn't actually matter (111:10 - 111:14)
black and white did that too (111:12 - 111:16)
black two white two (111:14 - 111:18)
because it isn't the first black oh wait (111:16 - 111:20)
now the first black and white (111:18 - 111:20)
you (111:20 - 111:23)
don't even battle the champion because (111:20 - 111:24)
getz shows up (111:23 - 111:26)
but you still can do these yeah (111:24 - 111:28)
the order because they have like the (111:26 - 111:30)
four doors (111:28 - 111:32)
um but yeah the original black and white (111:30 - 111:33)
you don't battle get you battle gets (111:32 - 111:35)
this instead and then if you go through (111:33 - 111:36)
the whole if you go through the elite (111:35 - 111:40)
four again then you get to battle alder (111:36 - 111:42)
um yeah so black and white did that my (111:40 - 111:44)
mistake but yeah that never like (111:42 - 111:46)
i don't know like (111:44 - 111:48)
maybe (111:46 - 111:49)
maybe you guys can speak differently but (111:48 - 111:51)
i would i would walk into like x and y (111:49 - 111:53)
or i walk into sun and moon and i would (111:51 - 111:55)
be like i'm just gonna go left to right (111:53 - 111:56)
because (111:55 - 111:59)
i don't like does it really matter if i (111:56 - 112:00)
start right to left i mean like i gotta (111:59 - 112:03)
battle them anyways yeah it matters (112:00 - 112:06)
because whoever your worst matchup is (112:03 - 112:08)
you want to go against first while your (112:06 - 112:10)
pokemon are strongest and then oh (112:08 - 112:12)
because you walked in with like a (112:10 - 112:14)
thousand full restorers (112:12 - 112:18)
[Laughter] (112:14 - 112:18)
if you choose (112:21 - 112:25)
to not (112:24 - 112:26)
prepare (112:25 - 112:29)
or not revive like like there's a (112:26 - 112:31)
complete validity in wanting to do that (112:29 - 112:33)
right like there is the person that is (112:31 - 112:34)
like (112:33 - 112:36)
they they go into a gym (112:34 - 112:39)
they battle like the two the two or (112:36 - 112:41)
three npcs and then they leave the gym (112:39 - 112:43)
and then they heal and then they come (112:41 - 112:44)
back in and then they fight lieutenant (112:43 - 112:46)
serge at full health and they go oh that (112:44 - 112:49)
was easy and it's like well (112:46 - 112:50)
you made the choice to leave the gym and (112:49 - 112:51)
heal (112:50 - 112:53)
like you could have just challenged him (112:51 - 112:56)
after battling the three npcs and it (112:53 - 112:58)
probably would have been tougher but you (112:56 - 113:00)
made that choice the game didn't tell (112:58 - 113:02)
you you needed to do that (113:00 - 113:04)
just like the game doesn't tell you (113:02 - 113:06)
you you need to use x items you need to (113:04 - 113:08)
use potions you need to use revives you (113:06 - 113:10)
can choose (113:08 - 113:11)
not to use (113:10 - 113:14)
them um (113:11 - 113:14)
like there there was like a a person on (113:14 - 113:18)
twitter saying like pokemon games are so (113:16 - 113:20)
easy and i do hate that argument because (113:18 - 113:22)
like again if if you feel like you're (113:20 - 113:24)
over leveled for a battle no one's (113:22 - 113:27)
telling you to bring these pokemon in (113:24 - 113:29)
like you can box them and the nice thing (113:27 - 113:30)
about pokemon games is you can box them (113:29 - 113:32)
at any point (113:30 - 113:33)
you can throw them in the box and grab (113:32 - 113:36)
different pokemon you can go out and (113:33 - 113:38)
catch new pokemon (113:36 - 113:40)
don't know if anyone knows this but you (113:38 - 113:41)
know in a game with 400 pokemon you have (113:40 - 113:43)
plenty of options like you don't have to (113:41 - 113:45)
use the same six (113:43 - 113:47)
um (113:45 - 113:50)
but i think that's the nice thing about (113:47 - 113:53)
these games is they do (113:50 - 113:55)
allow you to do what you want if you (113:53 - 113:57)
wanna if you wanna challenge lieutenant (113:55 - 113:59)
surge with six pokemon you can if you (113:57 - 114:01)
wanna challenge lieutenant surge with (113:59 - 114:03)
two pokemon (114:01 - 114:05)
you can make that choice like the game (114:03 - 114:07)
doesn't force you to do that the game (114:05 - 114:09)
might say like you know let's go pikachu (114:07 - 114:11)
let's go eevee you you have to show 35 (114:09 - 114:14)
pokemon caught to get into erica's gym (114:11 - 114:16)
like yeah you know they're they're (114:14 - 114:18)
forcing you to catch some pokemon to (114:16 - 114:19)
like hey play this part of the game (114:18 - 114:21)
please but like when you get there (114:19 - 114:23)
your freedom of choice is (114:21 - 114:25)
back it's just like they're using that (114:23 - 114:28)
as like a key to get to the next area (114:25 - 114:29)
so (114:28 - 114:31)
yes you will you're correct if if you (114:29 - 114:34)
were like in the elite four and you were (114:31 - 114:36)
like i want to make this harder (114:34 - 114:37)
and because (114:36 - 114:40)
i i don't want to use potions or i don't (114:37 - 114:42)
want to use revives i will do my worst (114:40 - 114:44)
match up first because i don't want to (114:42 - 114:46)
do it last there's complete validity in (114:44 - 114:49)
that i do agree with you yes (114:46 - 114:51)
um (114:49 - 114:53)
that would probably also add more (114:51 - 114:54)
variety to like a nuzlocke challenge as (114:53 - 114:56)
well if you were like (114:54 - 114:59)
oh totally oh man nuzlockes in this (114:56 - 115:00)
region are going to be (114:59 - 115:01)
nightmarish (115:00 - 115:03)
yeah so i guess (115:01 - 115:06)
if you know your first pokemon was (115:03 - 115:08)
fido (115:06 - 115:10)
you're probably like um i'm gonna go to (115:08 - 115:13)
the dark type gym because i have the (115:10 - 115:15)
advantage there and hopefully by the (115:13 - 115:17)
time i get something else then i could (115:15 - 115:19)
go to the steel type gym where you know (115:17 - 115:20)
fido wouldn't be (115:19 - 115:22)
that great yeah that's part of the (115:20 - 115:24)
strategy (115:22 - 115:24)
so i i changed my mind i take it all (115:25 - 115:29)
back seems it seems it's a better game (115:27 - 115:33)
10 out of 10. great (115:29 - 115:33)
um (115:33 - 115:35)
[Music] (115:34 - 115:37)
we're probably missing news the last (115:35 - 115:39)
thing i'll say here is if you do (115:37 - 115:40)
pre-order this off pokemon center dot (115:39 - 115:43)
com um one expect it not to arrive on (115:40 - 115:46)
release day i think (115:43 - 115:49)
oh boy i stream these games on twitch (115:46 - 115:50)
the day they launch and the amount of (115:49 - 115:52)
people that are like (115:50 - 115:53)
game's not here yet i pre-ordered (115:52 - 115:55)
legends it's not coming till monday (115:53 - 115:57)
pre-ordered sword and shield delayed two (115:55 - 115:59)
weeks pre-ordered brilliant diamond (115:57 - 116:01)
shining pearl (115:59 - 116:03)
still not here yet (116:01 - 116:05)
if you want the pre-order bonus (116:03 - 116:06)
for (116:05 - 116:09)
scarlet and violet you do get a unique (116:06 - 116:10)
backpack (116:09 - 116:11)
that's your pre-order bonus we don't (116:10 - 116:13)
know what it is for gamestop we don't (116:11 - 116:14)
know what it is for amazon we don't know (116:13 - 116:16)
what it is for best buy if you want the (116:14 - 116:18)
in-game backpack not an irl backpack (116:16 - 116:20)
in-game backpack pre-order from pokemon (116:18 - 116:21)
center (116:20 - 116:23)
if you want to play the games on launch (116:21 - 116:26)
day i would not pre-order from pokemon (116:23 - 116:27)
center (116:26 - 116:29)
maybe just maybe pre-order the physical (116:27 - 116:31)
copy from pokemon center and then (116:29 - 116:33)
download like the digital copy for (116:31 - 116:35)
yourself like (116:33 - 116:38)
i don't know maybe you know do scarlet (116:35 - 116:39)
physical (116:38 - 116:41)
violet digital (116:39 - 116:42)
it's hard (116:41 - 116:44)
right because some people don't want to (116:42 - 116:45)
buy both copies but they want the (116:44 - 116:47)
backpack but they want to play on launch (116:45 - 116:48)
day (116:47 - 116:49)
i'm just all i'm saying is pokemon (116:48 - 116:50)
center (116:49 - 116:52)
has not been reliable for the last three (116:50 - 116:55)
games so (116:52 - 116:55)
you know (116:55 - 117:02)
take that with with what it is (116:57 - 117:02)
um (117:04 - 117:06)
yeah i think that's all the scarlet and (117:07 - 117:11)
violet news that we have again we're (117:09 - 117:13)
probably missing something i'm sure when (117:11 - 117:15)
greg comes back uh (117:13 - 117:17)
he'll have things to say (117:15 - 117:19)
they (117:17 - 117:22)
real quick for for other stuff in the in (117:19 - 117:24)
the presents you know they they you know (117:22 - 117:26)
cafe mix is still out there scamming you (117:24 - 117:29)
um you can get mewtwo latios latias i (117:26 - 117:31)
believe they're added to the game (117:29 - 117:32)
they (117:31 - 117:34)
for some reason spent three minutes of (117:32 - 117:35)
20 minutes talking about the world (117:34 - 117:36)
championships like they're really hyping (117:35 - 117:39)
it up um (117:36 - 117:41)
trophy the trophy like that was like (117:39 - 117:44)
well they're excited to have it again (117:41 - 117:46)
six people in the entire world are gonna (117:44 - 117:47)
have this trophy but they're like look (117:46 - 117:50)
at this trophy (117:47 - 117:50)
uh i expect we will get you know maybe a (117:50 - 117:55)
new pokemon or something (117:52 - 117:59)
at worlds um which is in about two weeks (117:55 - 118:02)
uh for unite they announced the pika (117:59 - 118:04)
party uh which is going on for the next (118:02 - 118:07)
month um also buzzwell is now in the (118:04 - 118:08)
game (118:07 - 118:09)
for masters (118:08 - 118:12)
they (118:09 - 118:12)
they i guess tricked people into (118:12 - 118:16)
thinking that that was like a heart gold (118:14 - 118:18)
soul silver remake for a hot second even (118:16 - 118:19)
though like (118:18 - 118:21)
masters players were like (118:19 - 118:23)
if there's one thing (118:21 - 118:25)
as a masters player (118:23 - 118:27)
they love the heck out of red (118:25 - 118:30)
they will give that character so many (118:27 - 118:33)
different opportunities and and they (118:30 - 118:35)
they just love that red character (118:33 - 118:36)
um (118:35 - 118:38)
so they showed a short trailer for for (118:36 - 118:40)
for masters and then you know the three (118:38 - 118:42)
year anniversary is coming for that (118:40 - 118:44)
still not a lot of details on that (118:42 - 118:46)
um (118:44 - 118:47)
and then for pokemon go they were like (118:46 - 118:49)
hey sapporo is happening this weekend (118:47 - 118:51)
you know international travel still not (118:49 - 118:53)
allowed unless you go in a travel group (118:51 - 118:55)
that (118:53 - 118:57)
wouldn't let you go to pokemon go or (118:55 - 118:59)
unless you have specific business (118:57 - 119:01)
which yeah my specific business is (118:59 - 119:02)
pokemon go (119:01 - 119:05)
[Laughter] (119:02 - 119:08)
my specific business is giving pikachu (119:05 - 119:10)
mr pikachu as much money as possible i (119:08 - 119:11)
would like to visit your country (119:10 - 119:13)
um (119:11 - 119:16)
so that event happened (119:13 - 119:17)
which reminds me after this podcast i (119:16 - 119:20)
gotta go catch a hop-it to finish that (119:17 - 119:22)
collection challenge (119:20 - 119:22)
um but i think that's it so no greg no (119:23 - 119:28)
question of the week will (119:25 - 119:29)
pokemon of the week uh last week's (119:28 - 119:31)
pokemon of the week uh it started out (119:29 - 119:33)
it's a seven but that's the sum of the (119:31 - 119:34)
two other numbers that make up its (119:33 - 119:36)
national dex number which are also (119:34 - 119:40)
primes so clearly it's either 527 or 257 (119:36 - 119:41)
if you were paying attention and its (119:40 - 119:43)
name sounds like the other pokemon of (119:41 - 119:45)
which it was made in interpretation and (119:43 - 119:48)
so far unlike that other pokemon it does (119:45 - 119:50)
not have a third evolution but you also (119:48 - 119:51)
need high friendship to achieve its (119:50 - 119:54)
final evolution (119:51 - 119:57)
it's swoobat (119:54 - 119:58)
blaziken (119:57 - 120:00)
no blaziken doesn't sound like anything (119:58 - 120:02)
and it's not an interpretation of any (120:00 - 120:06)
other pokemon it is woo back correct (120:02 - 120:06)
well then i guess that wasn't the right (120:07 - 120:10)
one (120:09 - 120:14)
you had a 50 50 chance though (120:10 - 120:14)
why did you pick woof hat (120:15 - 120:20)
why are we calling it woo bat is it not (120:18 - 120:23)
swoo bat oh is it super no no it's woo (120:20 - 120:27)
bat it is (120:23 - 120:27)
[Music] (120:28 - 120:31)
leveled up with high friendship yes is (120:35 - 120:39)
there any trivia here (120:37 - 120:41)
probably something about parallels with (120:39 - 120:43)
zubat (120:41 - 120:43)
um (120:44 - 120:46)
evolutionary family has similar (120:46 - 120:51)
similarities to zubat both members are (120:48 - 120:53)
called the bat pokemon they live in (120:51 - 120:54)
caves or other dark places they both (120:53 - 120:57)
have no visible eyes (120:54 - 120:59)
uh at their respective uninvolved forms (120:57 - 121:01)
furthermore members of both lines (120:59 - 121:03)
respectfully evolve by forms through (121:01 - 121:04)
friendship (121:03 - 121:06)
they both have similar shinies green (121:04 - 121:08)
main like that's a bad trade like every (121:06 - 121:11)
pokemon is green chinese uh wubat and (121:08 - 121:13)
zubat also have somewhat similar english (121:11 - 121:15)
names both rhyming with prefixes of bat (121:13 - 121:18)
both rhyming (121:15 - 121:23)
prefixes and bat as the suffix (121:18 - 121:23)
wubat was first seen as concept art from (121:24 - 121:28)
pokemon black and white along with sir (121:26 - 121:32)
vine duat and axe you (121:28 - 121:34)
wait what happened to (121:32 - 121:37)
pick night was was pig night not shown (121:34 - 121:40)
in this this group of concept art i (121:37 - 121:41)
guess not (121:40 - 121:42)
carl (121:41 - 121:45)
a character in zoroark masters of (121:42 - 121:48)
illusion wears a baseball cap with (121:45 - 121:49)
woobat depicted on it i want that (121:48 - 121:52)
baseball cap as wubat's official art was (121:49 - 121:54)
revealed four days before the movie's (121:52 - 121:56)
release in japan the reveal of carl's (121:54 - 121:58)
design was the first time wubat's (121:56 - 122:02)
existence was hinted at (121:58 - 122:02)
do you think uh one day subat will (122:03 - 122:07)
evolve and like (122:05 - 122:08)
match (122:07 - 122:10)
crobat (122:08 - 122:12)
because they have so many similarities (122:10 - 122:13)
but like (122:12 - 122:15)
that's the one thing they don't have (122:13 - 122:16)
it's tough because they already did the (122:15 - 122:18)
evolution by friendship yeah they (122:16 - 122:21)
already did the friendship evo (122:18 - 122:24)
also (122:21 - 122:24)
like they they need to retain some of (122:24 - 122:28)
their unique snowflakeness you know they (122:26 - 122:31)
can't be exactly the same (122:28 - 122:35)
tell that to suck and throw (122:31 - 122:35)
are you ready for this week's pokemon (122:35 - 122:40)
yeah all right (122:38 - 122:44)
no one knows yet if it will evolve but i (122:40 - 122:47)
suspect this pokemon will evolve into a (122:44 - 122:50)
pokemon called beagle (122:47 - 122:53)
spelled b-e-a-g-e-l (122:50 - 122:53)
it's ice cube (122:55 - 122:58)
