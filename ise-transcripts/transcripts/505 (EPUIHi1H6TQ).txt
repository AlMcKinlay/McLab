they talked about pokken it was like the (4:43 - 4:48)
same like three dudes and they always (4:45 - 4:50)
used their (4:48 - 4:52)
their usernames so i like (4:50 - 4:54)

member of these things exactly (4:57 - 5:01)
that's always that's like the jarring (5:01 - 5:05)
thing in esports to me (5:03 - 5:07)
is like (5:05 - 5:10)
usernames (5:07 - 5:10)
i don't know just they have to be (5:11 - 5:16)

steve (5:30 - 5:33)
shadow cat is a way cooler thing to (5:31 - 5:35)

why don't all the bats because they have (5:37 - 5:40)
their last names (5:38 - 5:42)
are they using their names in esports (5:40 - 5:43)
yeah (5:42 - 5:44)

be known throughout the world by their (5:44 - 5:48)
last name they have to hide that stuff (5:46 - 5:51)
no they don't yeah they do it's internet (5:48 - 5:53)
security if you knew their last names (5:51 - 5:55)
you could crack open their hack numbers (5:53 - 5:57)
they could get all sorts of things yeah (5:55 - 6:00)
there's never been like (5:57 - 6:01)
millions of journalists around the world (6:00 - 6:05)

people with the switch you could still (7:19 - 7:23)
play it on mobile do it (7:20 - 7:24)
i'm sure it's on the floor fortnite (7:23 - 7:27)
sitting in the audience on the floor (7:24 - 7:28)
playing fortnite i mean that's really (7:27 - 7:30)
played a lot of monster hunter at (7:28 - 7:33)
pokemon events so (7:30 - 7:33)
the venue for the event is the enormous (7:33 - 7:41)
excel center excel london advent center (7:36 - 7:43)
it also hosted (7:41 - 7:44)
previous european international (7:43 - 7:46)

entry fee to participate at worlds but (8:27 - 8:31)
there will be a normal fee for spectator (8:29 - 8:33)

stay tuned for more information of the (8:35 - 8:38)

be a (8:45 - 8:50)
um covid 19 policy so (8:47 - 8:53)
so far the kova 19 policy just points to (8:50 - 8:55)
the current policy they have for (8:53 - 8:57)
the current (8:55 - 8:59)
events (8:57 - 9:00)

this weekend (9:00 - 9:03)
is going to be salt lake city which is (9:02 - 9:06)
the first (9:03 - 9:09)
north america (9:06 - 9:09)
official pokemon event i believe (9:10 - 9:14)
if i ever heard (9:12 - 9:15)
sure yeah i don't have the calendar in (9:14 - 9:16)
front of me but i'm pretty sure that's (9:15 - 9:19)
the case so we'll see how good that goes (9:16 - 9:21)
i got asked a lot of questions (9:19 - 9:23)
especially in the last month of like is (9:21 - 9:24)
it fun (9:23 - 9:25)
for (9:24 - 9:27)
spectators to go to these regional (9:25 - 9:28)
events (9:27 - 9:30)
and in the past (9:28 - 9:32)
that answer was so like (9:30 - 9:35)
maybe (9:32 - 9:35)
like sometimes like i think the location (9:36 - 9:41)
of the venue makes a a lot of that (9:38 - 9:43)
fun (9:41 - 9:44)
um there are things to do like there are (9:43 - 9:47)
there are always side events where you (9:44 - 9:49)
can (9:47 - 9:49)
uh at the regionals mm-hmm (9:49 - 9:54)
do they do the smaller events at the (9:53 - 9:55)
regionals (9:54 - 9:58)
yeah they have (9:55 - 9:58)
but but like again it's like so hit and (9:58 - 10:02)
miss (10:00 - 10:04)
and the smaller events also sometimes (10:02 - 10:05)
this (10:04 - 10:08)
the last regionals i went to (10:05 - 10:09)
i remember (10:08 - 10:10)
was the (10:09 - 10:12)
was the madison regionals (10:10 - 10:14)
and they did have side events (10:12 - 10:17)
and they had um they didn't have a (10:14 - 10:18)
pokemon center but they did (10:17 - 10:22)
have like vendors from the area (10:18 - 10:24)
and those vendors were selling (10:22 - 10:27)
cards or buying cards or selling plushes (10:24 - 10:29)
but (10:27 - 10:31)
they weren't (10:29 - 10:33)
i mean they're just vendors so they can (10:31 - 10:35)
price whatever they want they found like (10:33 - 10:37)
a pikachu backpack from 2001 and they're (10:35 - 10:41)
gonna slap like 120 on it because (10:37 - 10:42)
it was exclusive to toys r us or (10:41 - 10:44)
something it's like no one's gonna buy (10:42 - 10:46)
this pikachu backpack you can't fit a (10:44 - 10:49)
nintendo switch in it it's too tiny (10:46 - 10:49)
i don't know if that's the case now like (10:53 - 10:56)

actually happen at salt lake city (10:56 - 11:00)
like our vendors gonna be there is there (10:58 - 11:01)

your team to find archaeas (13:30 - 13:36)
to find archiest (13:33 - 13:38)
you will first need pokemon legends (13:36 - 13:40)
arceus save file on your nintendo switch (13:38 - 13:45)
with all main missions completed (13:40 - 13:45)
i need some clarification on this (13:46 - 13:49)
because i heard two things and i (13:47 - 13:50)
actually don't know (13:49 - 13:52)
because like it doesn't seem like anyone (13:50 - 13:53)
knows (13:52 - 13:56)
does that mean you need to see credits (13:53 - 13:57)
or does that mean you need to catch (13:56 - 13:58)
arceus (13:57 - 14:01)
from everything that i've seen people (13:58 - 14:03)
who have tried to do it after only (14:01 - 14:05)
seeing credits you have to have caught (14:03 - 14:07)
arceus i mean i could test it because i (14:05 - 14:08)
haven't (14:07 - 14:10)
gotten past i mean i've did credits i (14:08 - 14:12)
haven't caught arceus yet either (14:10 - 14:14)
but i've seen people say (14:12 - 14:15)
weasel (14:14 - 14:17)
like no you have to (14:15 - 14:20)
have completed all main missions and (14:17 - 14:22)
that is a main mission (14:20 - 14:24)
uh you'll also need to enter the hall of (14:22 - 14:27)
fame and obtain a the national pokedex (14:24 - 14:28)
in brilliant diamond and shining pearl (14:27 - 14:32)
national pokedex is just like seeing (14:28 - 14:33)
i think (14:32 - 14:37)
130 pokemon or something 160 pokemon (14:33 - 14:39)
whatever you can see them all as you go (14:37 - 14:40)
through the game except for driftloon (14:39 - 14:42)
which is only on fridays unless you (14:40 - 14:44)
purposely got the quiz wrong in (14:42 - 14:45)
fantina's gym yes to then see the (14:44 - 14:48)
driftloon (14:45 - 14:49)
uh (14:48 - 14:50)
once all conditions are met you will (14:49 - 14:52)
return to your room in brilliant diamond (14:50 - 14:54)
or shining pearl where you can get the (14:52 - 14:55)
azer (14:54 - 14:56)
azura flute (14:55 - 14:57)
then you can go to the spear pillar at (14:56 - 14:59)
the top of mount cornet and arceus will (14:57 - 15:02)
himself will be ready this is also not (14:59 - 15:04)
100 true (15:02 - 15:08)
he will not show up (15:04 - 15:08)
if you (15:09 - 15:12)
didn't catch your dialga or palkio prior (15:10 - 15:15)
to that oh yeah yeah during the story (15:12 - 15:17)
you just knock them out (15:15 - 15:19)
he will not they will not show up and (15:17 - 15:20)
the game doesn't tell you that so you (15:19 - 15:23)
have to beat the elite four (15:20 - 15:26)
to respawn either diago or palkia you (15:23 - 15:29)
don't need both that was like i saw some (15:26 - 15:30)
people be like well i can't do it (15:29 - 15:31)
because i don't have both games no no no (15:30 - 15:34)
no you just need to (15:31 - 15:35)
catch whatever (15:34 - 15:39)
legend was on your cover yeah (15:35 - 15:40)
you don't need to go and talk to grandma (15:39 - 15:42)
and grandma shows you a picture of the (15:40 - 15:43)
other one yeah (15:42 - 15:45)
yeah but she would have showed you the (15:43 - 15:46)
picture of the other one too because he (15:45 - 15:47)
did that for the national decks (15:46 - 15:49)
yeah i think but that's what people (15:47 - 15:53)
might be confused about as well (15:49 - 15:53)
okay we'll come back to the arceus thing (15:53 - 15:57)
because people were upset about that (15:55 - 15:59)
to befriend darkrai (15:57 - 16:01)
you (15:59 - 16:04)
must obtain the member card available (16:01 - 16:06)
between new moons is this is this (16:04 - 16:07)
actually true (16:06 - 16:10)
available but is this just like fluff or (16:07 - 16:11)
like (16:10 - 16:13)
so it says to befriend darkrai you must (16:11 - 16:15)
this is on pokemon.com by the way you (16:13 - 16:17)
must obtain the member card pokemon.com (16:15 - 16:20)
or pokemon.com no this is pokemon.com (16:17 - 16:23)
okay (16:20 - 16:23)
you must obtain the member card item an (16:24 - 16:28)
item (16:26 - 16:31)
available between the new moons via the (16:28 - 16:33)
mystery gift feature of brilliant (16:31 - 16:34)
diamond shining pearl once again you (16:33 - 16:36)
will need to enter the sino region's (16:34 - 16:37)
hall of fame (16:36 - 16:40)
obtain the national pokedex travel to (16:37 - 16:42)
new moon island where darkrai can be (16:40 - 16:44)
found (16:42 - 16:44)
is it saying like (16:44 - 16:48)
on the calendar (16:47 - 16:51)
there must be you must be between a new (16:48 - 16:53)
moon and a new moon (16:51 - 16:55)
in the actual iron world you're always (16:53 - 16:57)
between two new moons that's what i'm (16:55 - 17:01)
saying like is this just like fluff here (16:57 - 17:02)
is this their way of saying it's a (17:01 - 17:04)
limited time (17:02 - 17:06)
but then why don't they just say it's (17:04 - 17:07)
limited time because they're being no (17:06 - 17:09)
because with shaman they said you must (17:07 - 17:12)
get it before (17:09 - 17:12)
march 27th i think for shaman (17:12 - 17:18)
and for manafee it was you needed to get (17:16 - 17:20)
the manafee egg before like february (17:18 - 17:22)
15th (17:20 - 17:24)
this is just saying between new moons (17:22 - 17:27)
but there's always a new moon (17:24 - 17:29)
but is there like one day of the month (17:27 - 17:31)
where like it's not any moon so you're (17:29 - 17:33)
not allowed to download it then am i (17:31 - 17:35)
overthinking this yes (17:33 - 17:37)
yeah (17:35 - 17:39)
i mean i do think it is their way of (17:37 - 17:41)
saying that it's for a limited time (17:39 - 17:42)
period and it won't be downloadable (17:41 - 17:44)
until x date and it will stop being (17:42 - 17:47)
downloadable on x date and you do (17:44 - 17:49)
understand that the new moon is the day (17:47 - 17:51)
when there's not any moon it's the (17:49 - 17:54)
opposite of the full moon (17:51 - 17:54)
yeah right that's what i'm saying (17:55 - 17:59)
like is there one day where you can't (17:57 - 18:02)
get it because there's no moon (17:59 - 18:04)
[Laughter] (18:02 - 18:07)
if they put that much effort into dark (18:04 - 18:09)
rye (18:07 - 18:09)
so okay so looking around (18:10 - 18:15)
people are saying (18:13 - 18:18)
you can only download the ticket (18:15 - 18:21)
between april 1st and may 1st (18:18 - 18:24)
which is between so i believe the next (18:21 - 18:27)
new moon is april 1st (18:24 - 18:29)
oh it's just (18:27 - 18:32)
weird i why would they do it (18:29 - 18:32)
available between the new moons (18:36 - 18:40)
let me see if that is accurate (18:41 - 18:45)
i i'm my calendar doesn't show me the (18:46 - 18:49)
moon patterns i think i can toggle that (18:47 - 18:52)
on though yeah the next new moon is (18:49 - 18:54)
april 1st (18:52 - 18:54)
all right what was the last new moon (18:55 - 18:59)
march 1st march 2nd (18:57 - 19:01)
see that was our problem dark ride's a (18:59 - 19:02)
little late (19:01 - 19:04)
but it's because february messes up the (19:02 - 19:06)
pattern (19:04 - 19:06)
okay (19:07 - 19:11)
so according to that so (19:08 - 19:14)
why would you not put dates (19:11 - 19:15)
yeah (19:14 - 19:18)
i was this company is this true (19:15 - 19:20)
this is janine janine is boarded her job (19:18 - 19:21)
she's like (19:20 - 19:23)
i'm done with the calendar the way (19:21 - 19:25)
you've been you're all mad at me at my (19:23 - 19:27)
weekend dates fine i'm going to create a (19:25 - 19:29)
riddle well that's i was just going to (19:27 - 19:31)
say she's gotten so bored at scheduling (19:29 - 19:33)
things she's just going to do it pokemon (19:31 - 19:34)
of the week style (19:33 - 19:37)
here's a mystical arrangement of words (19:34 - 19:38)
and you can figure out when this is (19:37 - 19:42)
available when the moon isn't in the sky (19:38 - 19:46)
dark rye shall rise from the ground (19:42 - 19:49)
and will last until the moon once again (19:46 - 19:52)
disappears from the sky hear these words (19:49 - 19:54)
and fear (19:52 - 19:57)
uh i have some thoughts it it to me it (19:54 - 19:59)
is a little weird (19:57 - 20:01)
that (19:59 - 20:04)
okay let's back up beep beep beep beep (20:01 - 20:07)
you know why that's a beep (20:04 - 20:10)
yeah because the truck makes the noise (20:07 - 20:12)
they didn't do that they just used to (20:10 - 20:13)
run over people yeah (20:12 - 20:14)
[Music] (20:13 - 20:17)
um (20:14 - 20:17)
so the our speculation on the show was (20:17 - 20:22)
these games were so going to be so close (20:20 - 20:23)
together because they were going to (20:22 - 20:26)
interact with each other (20:23 - 20:26)
the interaction is put an asterix next (20:28 - 20:32)
to that word there is some interaction (20:30 - 20:34)
here (20:32 - 20:36)
like if arceus reads that you have (20:34 - 20:38)
diamond and pearl you get what you get (20:36 - 20:41)
like dark cry right and then if arceus (20:38 - 20:42)
reads that you have sword and shield you (20:41 - 20:45)
get shaymin (20:42 - 20:45)
in the game those two pokemon are based (20:45 - 20:50)
off sword and shield save data and (20:48 - 20:54)
let's uh diamond and pearl save it yes (20:50 - 20:55)
what i'll take your word for say that (20:54 - 20:57)
again (20:55 - 20:59)
sword and shield will either give you (20:57 - 21:02)
darkrai or shaman in pokemon legends and (20:59 - 21:03)
then (21:02 - 21:05)
diamond and pearl will either give you (21:03 - 21:08)
darkrai or shaymin in pokemon legends (21:05 - 21:10)
just like how i think let's go a (21:08 - 21:12)
brilliant diamond shining pro makes (21:10 - 21:14)
darkrai available in legends and having (21:12 - 21:16)
a save file for sword and shield makes (21:14 - 21:18)
shaymin available yes in pokemon i (21:16 - 21:20)
couldn't remember which one did what i (21:18 - 21:22)
okay i see what you're saying and then (21:20 - 21:23)
they also gave you the sentence made no (21:22 - 21:26)
sense to me and then they also gave you (21:23 - 21:27)
the uh outfits i think there was they (21:26 - 21:29)
were like uh (21:27 - 21:32)
like the pikachu and eevee mask and the (21:29 - 21:35)
other masks and that stuff (21:32 - 21:37)
so that was the extent of the (21:35 - 21:40)
interaction for that and you technically (21:37 - 21:43)
for to get to get arceus in legends (21:40 - 21:46)
arceus you do not need to catch shaman (21:43 - 21:48)
or (21:46 - 21:50)
darkrai (21:48 - 21:52)
because i went up the (21:50 - 21:55)
thingy and i caught arceus and i did the (21:52 - 21:56)
arceus battle (21:55 - 21:58)
and (21:56 - 22:00)
my shaymin is still sitting on the map (21:58 - 22:02)
my dark cry is still floating on the map (22:00 - 22:06)
you also do not need fione and manafi (22:02 - 22:08)
in legends arceus (22:06 - 22:10)
i i don't even know where they are i (22:08 - 22:11)
think i actually do know where they are (22:10 - 22:14)
i mean i did the whole thing and it's (22:11 - 22:16)
i don't know what triggers the side (22:14 - 22:17)
mission because i haven't started it yet (22:16 - 22:20)
so those pokemon you do not need to get (22:17 - 22:22)
arceus (22:20 - 22:24)
which brings us to (22:22 - 22:25)
brilliant diamond defending pearl (22:24 - 22:27)
where (22:25 - 22:29)
they're finally saying okay now you need (22:27 - 22:33)
arceus to access something to this game (22:29 - 22:34)
and (22:33 - 22:36)
that is just (22:34 - 22:39)
arceus again (22:36 - 22:42)
so from a marketing perspective (22:39 - 22:44)
i get it because that's what mythical (22:42 - 22:46)
pokemon are m for medical m for (22:44 - 22:49)
marketing and for marketing (22:46 - 22:51)
from a (22:49 - 22:53)
[Music] (22:51 - 22:56)
marketing perspective though (22:53 - 22:58)
you bought arceus (22:56 - 23:01)
with the selling point that you need to (22:58 - 23:05)
catch all the pokemon to catch arceus (23:01 - 23:05)
do (23:07 - 23:11)
is somebody like i really need two of (23:09 - 23:13)
them so (23:11 - 23:14)
i'm going to run out and buy brilliant (23:13 - 23:15)
diamond shining pearl so i can get it (23:14 - 23:18)
there was the selling point that like (23:15 - 23:20)
you can technically shiny hunt arceus in (23:18 - 23:21)
the other game (23:20 - 23:23)
like it just (23:21 - 23:25)
it's a very weak (23:23 - 23:26)
interaction between the two to be like (23:25 - 23:29)
oh yeah you're buying the game arceus to (23:26 - 23:32)
then unlock arceus in the other game but (23:29 - 23:36)
you have to catch him in the first one (23:32 - 23:38)
to get him in the second one (23:36 - 23:41)
it just seems very like (23:38 - 23:43)
why do i need two arceus (23:41 - 23:46)
i mean i need what 17 so i can have one (23:43 - 23:48)
for each plate well the people that are (23:46 - 23:50)
mad (23:48 - 23:50)
that's why they're mad oh is this is (23:51 - 23:56)
locked behind a paywall argument yes (23:53 - 23:58)
this is the paywall argument like well (23:56 - 24:00)
they should have gotten the distribution (23:58 - 24:02)
whatever five years ago yeah (24:00 - 24:04)
be better (24:02 - 24:07)
here's the thing like (24:04 - 24:09)
i think the paywall argument is bad (24:07 - 24:11)
it's a bad argument because you don't (24:09 - 24:13)
need it and (24:11 - 24:15)
they have given it away for free (24:13 - 24:17)
elsewhere and (24:15 - 24:20)
they tend to tie them to promotions or (24:17 - 24:22)
something they're trying to sell you (24:20 - 24:24)
this has been (24:22 - 24:27)
from the from the very beginning of (24:24 - 24:29)
pokemon these things come up because (24:27 - 24:31)
they're trying to and if you're really (24:29 - 24:33)
that bugged about it wait until pokemon (24:31 - 24:35)
go is literally out of ideas (24:33 - 24:39)
and throws one up in raids (24:35 - 24:40)
like (24:39 - 24:42)
the paywall argument (24:40 - 24:45)
it's a pay again it's pay to get it now (24:42 - 24:47)
you don't have to get it now (24:45 - 24:48)
you don't pay anything you could trade (24:47 - 24:50)
somebody get it later you can trade it (24:48 - 24:51)
from somebody you can find somebody i'm (24:50 - 24:54)
gonna have to i don't technically need (24:51 - 24:56)
to (24:54 - 24:56)
theoretically i'll have three because i (24:56 - 25:00)
bought both diamond and pearl (24:58 - 25:02)
unfortunately i did too but i haven't (25:00 - 25:04)
even played pearl (25:02 - 25:06)
that was the thing that drove me crazy (25:04 - 25:08)
for the let's go pikachu let's go eevee (25:06 - 25:12)
thing of like oh they put mew in a 50 (25:08 - 25:15)
pay wall no you're buying an entire (25:12 - 25:17)
controller that works with let's go (25:15 - 25:19)
pikachu let's go eevee and that also (25:17 - 25:21)
works with pokemon go it still works (25:19 - 25:24)
with pokemon go i have one right here on (25:21 - 25:26)
my desk and i use it (25:24 - 25:29)
every single day i play go that (25:26 - 25:32)
controller is so good i didn't even do (25:29 - 25:34)
community day on sunday and still caught (25:32 - 25:36)
five shinies (25:34 - 25:39)
this this device (25:36 - 25:43)
has been worth every like i (25:39 - 25:44)
here's (25:43 - 25:45)
here's for people listening to the audio (25:44 - 25:47)
podcast i'm holding up the pokeball plus (25:45 - 25:49)
to the video podcast on youtube hey if (25:47 - 25:50)
you're listening on youtube like and (25:49 - 25:53)
subscribe um (25:50 - 25:54)
you know the best part about this (25:53 - 25:56)
pokeball plus (25:54 - 25:57)
i got this on launch day when let's go (25:56 - 26:00)
pikachu let's go eevee came out (25:57 - 26:02)
the mew is still on here because i've (26:00 - 26:04)
been so lazy (26:02 - 26:06)
i i did i (26:04 - 26:08)
wha what am i gonna do with the mew i (26:06 - 26:11)
didn't spend fifty dollars for a mew if (26:08 - 26:12)
i (26:11 - 26:13)
if i was to sink this so let's go (26:12 - 26:14)
pikachu let's go eave your sword and (26:13 - 26:15)
shield (26:14 - 26:18)
move the mew off that's okay now it's (26:15 - 26:20)
gonna live in a box forever (26:18 - 26:22)
literally no like but how sad are you (26:20 - 26:24)
gonna be when that battery on that thing (26:22 - 26:26)
permanently dies and the mew dies with (26:24 - 26:29)
it i'll eventually move i'll be much (26:26 - 26:30)
less sad about the flapple i got stuck (26:29 - 26:33)
in mine (26:30 - 26:36)
i mean to to some extent (26:33 - 26:39)
people are right that it's been a while (26:36 - 26:42)
since they've done it for free so the (26:39 - 26:44)
only way to legally (26:42 - 26:45)
obtain these things is by purchasing (26:44 - 26:49)
these games and (26:45 - 26:49)
you theoretically have to purchase (26:50 - 26:56)
legends yeah to get to but okay if if (26:52 - 27:00)
the only reason that you're purchasing (26:56 - 27:02)
a game is not to play it but because you (27:00 - 27:04)
have to get (27:02 - 27:07)
a specific pokemon you may need to sort (27:04 - 27:10)
of look at your fomo issues (27:07 - 27:12)
and (27:10 - 27:17)
if if this is that important to you (27:12 - 27:19)
why is it that important to you like i (27:17 - 27:22)
get it it stinks that i on some level it (27:19 - 27:24)
thinks that the pokemon company does tie (27:22 - 27:27)
things to (27:24 - 27:29)
purchases (27:27 - 27:31)
that is how every corporation exactly (27:29 - 27:33)
they're not here they're here to make (27:31 - 27:35)
money they are here to make money and (27:33 - 27:37)
they're here to encourage sales and this (27:35 - 27:39)
is an easy way to encourage sales and i (27:37 - 27:42)
can i get like capitalism bad whatever (27:39 - 27:44)
this is this is the system that we're in (27:42 - 27:47)
they also have given it away for free in (27:44 - 27:48)
the past (27:47 - 27:51)
they can give it away for free (27:48 - 27:54)
in the future (27:51 - 27:54)
you need to sort of reframe your (27:55 - 28:00)
argument like if you just want to be mad (27:58 - 28:02)
at capitalism be mad at capitalism like (28:00 - 28:03)
there's a lot of things to hate about (28:02 - 28:05)
capitalism (28:03 - 28:06)
but (28:05 - 28:08)
don't (28:06 - 28:11)
like chide and rant at people like if (28:08 - 28:13)
you think it's an unfair thing don't buy (28:11 - 28:14)
it (28:13 - 28:16)
that's the thing i don't get they didn't (28:14 - 28:18)
buy it how do you (28:16 - 28:20)
how do you not buy legends or dive maybe (28:18 - 28:22)
you bought diamond pearl i'm sorry if (28:20 - 28:24)
you did but how do you like not buy (28:22 - 28:25)
legends (28:24 - 28:27)
a game that features arceus and then be (28:25 - 28:29)
bad that you don't have arcades but i (28:27 - 28:30)
mean i bought legends but i didn't (28:29 - 28:32)
finish it and i still now i can't get my (28:30 - 28:36)
arceus i haven't finished it either (28:32 - 28:38)
i mean i i don't have to stop playing (28:36 - 28:40)
unite to finish that game (28:38 - 28:42)
unite doesn't give you nothing for free (28:40 - 28:45)
like i feel i feel like the the people (28:42 - 28:46)
that (28:45 - 28:48)
were complaining about missing the (28:46 - 28:50)
pokemon were also the people not (28:48 - 28:52)
purchasing the games (28:50 - 28:53)
like i felt like everyone complaining (28:52 - 28:55)
about the mew and let's go pikachu let's (28:53 - 28:57)
go eevee we're also just mad that let's (28:55 - 28:59)
go pikachu let's go eevee existed and (28:57 - 29:01)
then also mad they didn't have a mew (28:59 - 29:04)
well i mean they're (29:01 - 29:04)
they don't like (29:04 - 29:07)
there are people who have limited (29:06 - 29:09)
budgets they don't have to buy (29:07 - 29:11)
everything to get things and like i can (29:09 - 29:15)
kind of see like i i i only can spend x (29:11 - 29:16)
amount of money on the things that i (29:15 - 29:18)
know i'm gonna like (29:16 - 29:21)
and i don't want to put money on a bad (29:18 - 29:22)
game like brilliant diamond shining (29:21 - 29:26)
pearl just to unlock something like i (29:22 - 29:30)
get i get how you get to that point (29:26 - 29:31)
because (29:30 - 29:32)
you know you may only have a budget (29:31 - 29:35)
about sixty dollars in a year to buy one (29:32 - 29:36)
game (29:35 - 29:37)
and (29:36 - 29:40)
they aren't necessarily coming complete (29:37 - 29:42)
and like that is a separate (29:40 - 29:44)
arc like getting something as a bonus (29:42 - 29:46)
versus complete i think a different (29:44 - 29:49)
argument altogether so i can get like (29:46 - 29:51)
everybody said brilliant diamond shining (29:49 - 29:53)
pearl is bad but i have to get it to (29:51 - 29:56)
unlock certain things and that is the (29:53 - 29:59)
nature of capitalism yeah but okay if (29:56 - 30:03)
you're if you're a gamer on a budget (29:59 - 30:05)
and let's say you're you're you your (30:03 - 30:07)
only game you purchased was was legends (30:05 - 30:08)
arceus (30:07 - 30:10)
you're still missing darkrai what do you (30:08 - 30:14)
need for darkrai you need you need a (30:10 - 30:15)
brilliant diamond shining pearl save (30:14 - 30:17)
data for dark yeah right (30:15 - 30:20)
you could go to your local library and (30:17 - 30:22)
rent brilliant diamond shining pro for (30:20 - 30:23)
free with your library card (30:22 - 30:25)
and then play it for five minutes and (30:23 - 30:27)
then return it and now you've just given (30:25 - 30:29)
yourself dark cry and i mean (30:27 - 30:31)
they have (30:29 - 30:33)
the figure library has it i don't think (30:31 - 30:35)
minneapolis libraries are lending out (30:33 - 30:38)
video games as far as i can recall most (30:35 - 30:42)
libraries are now doing everything (30:38 - 30:45)
really but also you could (30:42 - 30:47)
you could (30:45 - 30:50)
borrow if you could like borrow your (30:47 - 30:52)
friend's copy and put it in your switch (30:50 - 30:54)
system and literally start the game name (30:52 - 30:56)
your character walk outside your house (30:54 - 30:58)
save and now you have darkrai now if (30:56 - 31:00)
you're gonna if you're gonna sit here (30:58 - 31:03)
and be like well i don't have friends (31:00 - 31:05)
to borrow that from (31:03 - 31:07)
and now i'm angry because i need the (31:05 - 31:10)
darkrai or i need the arceus (31:07 - 31:12)
where was that energy for ultra sun (31:10 - 31:15)
ultra moon a game that literally were (31:12 - 31:17)
both 40 (31:15 - 31:18)
i'll use their argument forty dollar (31:17 - 31:21)
paywalls to get blissful on and to get (31:18 - 31:25)
stockataka stackataka and to get poiple (31:21 - 31:27)
both games had poiple but one game had (31:25 - 31:31)
blissful on one game had the other one (31:27 - 31:34)
um (31:31 - 31:34)
and i think those games gave you two of (31:34 - 31:37)
each but (31:36 - 31:39)
they gave you two of each so you could (31:37 - 31:43)
like one for you one to trade (31:39 - 31:43)
but also like this this is not a new (31:43 - 31:47)
thing like this didn't start with let's (31:45 - 31:49)
go pikachu let's go eevee this this (31:47 - 31:51)
company (31:49 - 31:54)
made a a spin-off game on the ds and (31:51 - 31:57)
they were like for a low low price of (31:54 - 31:58)
forty dollars (31:57 - 32:01)
you can ruin your touch screen and get a (31:58 - 32:02)
mana feed (32:01 - 32:07)
like are you excited no no no one wants (32:02 - 32:07)
no one wants to draw circles forever (32:08 - 32:11)
just to get a manafie egg at the end i'm (32:10 - 32:13)
pretty sure you had that game too to get (32:11 - 32:15)
that am on the minneapolis library (32:13 - 32:17)
website and there's movies and tvs and (32:15 - 32:20)
music there is no video games listed oh (32:17 - 32:23)
no reddit says that uh (32:20 - 32:26)
uh hennepin county library (32:23 - 32:28)
does and definitely uh ramsey county and (32:26 - 32:30)
you can add ramsey county to your (32:28 - 32:32)
hennepin county library card somehow (32:30 - 32:34)
through magic yeah i just don't know (32:32 - 32:36)
their brows it is a notable (32:34 - 32:38)
lack of the things you can browse for i (32:36 - 32:41)
i live in hennepin county the the points (32:38 - 32:43)
[Laughter] (32:41 - 32:45)
the point being is there's so many ways (32:43 - 32:48)
to get this done (32:45 - 32:50)
you could you could have (32:48 - 32:53)
gotten this arceus from various events (32:50 - 32:55)
before (32:53 - 32:58)
you could have traded this arceus from (32:55 - 33:00)
another person (32:58 - 33:02)
you could just buy (33:00 - 33:04)
bro you could just buy (33:02 - 33:06)
legends arceus and play through that (33:04 - 33:09)
game and get arceus at the end (33:06 - 33:10)
uh (33:09 - 33:12)
you could (33:10 - 33:12)
borrow the game from a friend you could (33:13 - 33:17)
rent the game from a library like i (33:15 - 33:19)
don't (33:17 - 33:19)
the hennepin county library has a (33:19 - 33:25)
surprising amount of pokemon manga (33:21 - 33:25)
i just hate the like (33:25 - 33:29)
they're putting this they're putting (33:27 - 33:32)
more pokemon behind a paywall (33:29 - 33:36)
you gotta spend 60 even play this game (33:32 - 33:38)
[Laughter] (33:36 - 33:40)
like clash royale it's not free to (33:38 - 33:42)
download and then just play and get your (33:40 - 33:44)
enjoyment out of (33:42 - 33:45)
it is not (33:44 - 33:48)
a great argument no it is an argument i (33:45 - 33:50)
can see how you get there i can see how (33:48 - 33:54)
you can be frustrated at (33:50 - 33:56)
they want me to buy more things that i (33:54 - 33:59)
don't want but like (33:56 - 34:01)
if that is your point like i don't want (33:59 - 34:02)
to buy these things then you kind of (34:01 - 34:05)
need to come to terms with (34:02 - 34:09)
this is how it works this is the this is (34:05 - 34:11)
their marketing this is what they put (34:09 - 34:13)
out there this is how they want (34:11 - 34:15)
these things distributed the whole goal (34:13 - 34:18)
is to make you buy other things in their (34:15 - 34:22)
franchise that's it is not unique to (34:18 - 34:24)
pokemon it is not unique to (34:22 - 34:26)
the nintendo company (34:24 - 34:29)
a lot of places do it like (34:26 - 34:33)
at my particular office if you wanted (34:29 - 34:35)
for a while there if you wanted (34:33 - 34:37)
unlimited data you had to buy a tv (34:35 - 34:38)
service (34:37 - 34:40)
so (34:38 - 34:42)
those two things were tied (34:40 - 34:44)
for a very long time and then they undid (34:42 - 34:48)
that once x amount of time had passed (34:44 - 34:50)
it is just how capital (34:48 - 34:52)
capitalism currently works and i think (34:50 - 34:53)
credit (34:52 - 34:55)
when has disney ever given anything away (34:53 - 34:58)
for free no anything (34:55 - 35:00)
they won't even give you a free digital (34:58 - 35:04)
character anywhere (35:00 - 35:04)
the real the real shame here is (35:05 - 35:09)
i mean disney's worst because they put (35:07 - 35:12)
things in the vault specifically to make (35:09 - 35:14)
collectors have to buy it in a certain (35:12 - 35:16)
time frame and then they're like well (35:14 - 35:18)
this is going back in the vault for 10 (35:16 - 35:20)
years and you will not see this movie (35:18 - 35:22)
sold anywhere and then well the pokemon (35:20 - 35:24)
company does that too like yeah if you (35:22 - 35:25)
don't if you don't get your shame in the (35:24 - 35:27)
next 10 days like (35:25 - 35:28)
into the vault (35:27 - 35:29)
like no more (35:28 - 35:32)
and and uh (35:29 - 35:34)
you have to download it you have to get (35:32 - 35:36)
that take it you can collect it at any (35:34 - 35:38)
time you have to get the ticket and for (35:36 - 35:39)
dark ride janine says it's between two (35:38 - 35:42)
new moons so (35:39 - 35:42)
you know um (35:43 - 35:47)
the real shame here is you actually have (35:45 - 35:48)
to play through brilliant diamond (35:47 - 35:50)
shining pearl you have to like (35:48 - 35:53)
the amount of (35:50 - 35:53)
the amount of people in my twitch chat (35:54 - 35:57)
that were like (35:56 - 35:59)
i never beat the game because i didn't (35:57 - 36:00)
like it (35:59 - 36:03)
and now now they want to like (36:00 - 36:04)
well they're like well i have to if i (36:03 - 36:06)
beat the game i can just go get like (36:04 - 36:09)
they they enjoyed legends right so it's (36:06 - 36:11)
like well if i well and i i do i do have (36:09 - 36:13)
a lot of shiny hunters that come through (36:11 - 36:14)
so they're like oh i would love to shiny (36:13 - 36:16)
hunt arceus or i'd love to shiny hunt (36:14 - 36:19)
shaman and it's like yeah those would be (36:16 - 36:21)
cool shiny hunts for sure totally (36:19 - 36:22)
especially in a game that has a lot of (36:21 - 36:24)
ribbons and you can like (36:22 - 36:26)
catch the arceus and go take him and you (36:24 - 36:28)
know dance with god and then get a bunch (36:26 - 36:31)
of ribbons on god that's cool (36:28 - 36:33)
but you have to play (36:31 - 36:35)
you have to play the game and like (36:33 - 36:39)
that's a real drag (36:35 - 36:39)
i (36:40 - 36:44)
can't imagine (36:41 - 36:44)
shining hunting both of these things (36:45 - 36:50)
like i can't imagine doing shaman and (36:48 - 36:52)
they can't imagine doing arceus i (36:50 - 36:54)
i just want to get him in the luxury (36:52 - 36:55)
ball and be happy (36:54 - 36:58)
oh do you get to choose your ball (36:55 - 37:00)
yeah yeah yeah yeah you can battle and (36:58 - 37:03)
catch oh to get the shaman for arceus i (37:00 - 37:04)
think is actually easier because once (37:03 - 37:06)
you catch the elgar palkia you just go (37:04 - 37:07)
back there and then walk up the glass (37:06 - 37:08)
staircase for shaman you got to go (37:07 - 37:10)
through a side cave (37:08 - 37:12)
you got to walk with what's her name (37:10 - 37:14)
marley (37:12 - 37:17)
can i can we talk about how brilliant (37:14 - 37:19)
diamond shiny pearl are bad games they (37:17 - 37:20)
they really are they're awful they're (37:19 - 37:22)
they're disagree (37:20 - 37:24)
when you when you go through this cave (37:22 - 37:25)
with marley (37:24 - 37:27)
to get to shaman if you haven't done (37:25 - 37:28)
this yet (37:27 - 37:31)
her arcanine knows (37:28 - 37:33)
like (37:31 - 37:36)
bulk up helping hand (37:33 - 37:37)
roar or (37:36 - 37:41)
growl or something and then it knows uh (37:37 - 37:43)
what's that move like burnout (37:41 - 37:45)
where it does the fire type move but (37:43 - 37:47)
then it and it does damage and they can (37:45 - 37:50)
only do it once so it literally can only (37:47 - 37:51)
and you have to do like (37:50 - 37:53)
seven double battles (37:51 - 37:55)
she follows you around and you can't you (37:53 - 37:58)
can't surf you can't go the fast way so (37:55 - 38:00)
you gotta you gotta suffer (37:58 - 38:03)
i i have beat cynthia i have captured (38:00 - 38:06)
all these pokemon i have knocked out two (38:03 - 38:08)
million hound dooms to get my team to (38:06 - 38:11)
level 97 and now i gotta go through this (38:08 - 38:12)
cave (38:11 - 38:16)
post game with marley of all people you (38:12 - 38:17)
you've done all those accomplishments (38:16 - 38:19)
but you haven't learned the one rule of (38:17 - 38:21)
having an npc double battler in your (38:19 - 38:25)
party kill their pokemon first yeah and (38:21 - 38:27)
do the battle on your own by yourself do (38:25 - 38:29)
it on your own terms (38:27 - 38:32)
if they give her a pokemon that can (38:29 - 38:37)
physically and literally only attack one (38:32 - 38:39)
time you'll walk it out don't let it (38:37 - 38:42)
waste your time anti-friendship stance (38:39 - 38:45)
is an affront to how the pokemon world (38:42 - 38:48)
works (38:45 - 38:48)
i (38:48 - 38:50)
for playing like 200 hours in legends (38:51 - 38:56)
and then like oh let's let's go like do (38:53 - 38:58)
like 10 resets for shaymin a day that'll (38:56 - 39:01)
be fun and then having to get to shaven (38:58 - 39:04)
is the shame and shiny even good yeah (39:01 - 39:05)
shame and shiny is pretty good yeah it's (39:04 - 39:07)
good (39:05 - 39:11)
is it yes it's good it's good (39:07 - 39:14)
i am looking this up and now no it's not (39:11 - 39:15)
it's blue (39:14 - 39:19)
it's good blue shaymin (39:15 - 39:19)
i am still standing by (39:21 - 39:26)
we're going to take a break (39:25 - 39:27)
that (39:26 - 39:30)
brilliant diamond shining pearl (39:27 - 39:32)
were probably the most (39:30 - 39:36)
unneeded pokemon games to ever happen (39:32 - 39:37)
they're just (39:36 - 39:39)
they were needed for something but just (39:37 - 39:41)
not for what you wanted them to be (39:39 - 39:42)
needed for i don't think they were (39:41 - 39:44)
needed at all (39:42 - 39:47)
like two like platinum is a better (39:44 - 39:49)
game (39:47 - 39:49)
fine is the arc is shiny any good it's (39:50 - 39:58)
gold yeah (39:54 - 39:58)
all right (39:59 - 40:02)
let's take a break uh (40:00 - 40:04)
we got a couple more news articles so we (40:02 - 40:07)
will be right back (40:04 - 40:11)
and we are back so (40:07 - 40:14)
we're from our break (40:11 - 40:15)
with uh (40:14 - 40:18)
1.3.0 being added to brilliant diamond (40:15 - 40:20)
shining pearl the (40:18 - 40:22)
gws is now open (40:20 - 40:25)
in juba life (40:22 - 40:26)
uh (40:25 - 40:29)
if you keep doing trades you earn rare (40:26 - 40:33)
candy that's a thing i guess (40:29 - 40:33)
what it's like five points gives you one (40:33 - 40:37)
rare candy 25 points gives you like (40:35 - 40:39)
three work there's like (40:37 - 40:42)
you can earn up to like 400 rare candy (40:39 - 40:44)
if you like do all the math and add it (40:42 - 40:46)
together (40:44 - 40:46)
does that encourage anyone to go back to (40:47 - 40:51)
the game to (40:50 - 40:54)
trade pokemon maybe (40:51 - 40:56)
it's just it's just they're wonder trade (40:54 - 40:59)
right like (40:56 - 41:02)
or is it is it like both (40:59 - 41:04)
you can wonder trade (41:02 - 41:06)
and then you can um but you can only (41:04 - 41:09)
wonder trade there you can't (41:06 - 41:11)
like walk around and wonder trade like (41:09 - 41:12)
you can in sword and shield (41:11 - 41:14)
or surprise trade i think they call it (41:12 - 41:16)
certain ship yeah like oh surprise right (41:14 - 41:18)
and then you can do the whole like (41:16 - 41:19)
search for a pokemon and then trade a (41:18 - 41:22)
pokemon (41:19 - 41:22)
why it took this long (41:23 - 41:28)
to do that (41:25 - 41:28)
who knows (41:29 - 41:34)
i mean this might actually get me to (41:32 - 41:37)
maybe decide to play (41:34 - 41:39)
pearl (41:37 - 41:39)
i have to be real desperate though (41:39 - 41:43)
and i'm like (41:43 - 41:48)
already mad at the game men unite so i (41:45 - 41:49)
don't know if i have that much anger in (41:48 - 41:52)
my heart right now (41:49 - 41:52)
yeah uh according to this article it (41:57 - 42:01)
says (41:59 - 42:04)
there are 630 trade points that you can (42:01 - 42:06)
earn (42:04 - 42:06)
and (42:06 - 42:10)
the (42:08 - 42:10)
there is a trading system where you can (42:12 - 42:15)
receive a random pokemon traded by (42:14 - 42:18)
random trainer there are trade points (42:15 - 42:19)
which (42:18 - 42:21)
there are many trade points from which (42:19 - 42:24)
pokemon can be traded trading a pokemon (42:21 - 42:26)
a player will ask for a trade (42:24 - 42:29)
point with another trade so you can like (42:26 - 42:31)
search for pokemon you want (42:29 - 42:34)
it's it it's whatever (42:31 - 42:34)
i don't know who's doing this like i (42:35 - 42:40)
don't know who is (42:36 - 42:40)
going back to this game to be like i'm (42:40 - 42:44)
missing (42:42 - 42:46)
weasel somebody please trade me japanese (42:44 - 42:48)
boys i guess it probably is good for (42:46 - 42:50)
masuda method uh it's different from a (42:48 - 42:54)
soda method it's good for (42:50 - 42:54)
catching things that don't appear (42:55 - 43:01)
because of the swarm process or the (42:58 - 43:03)
if you're like i just need to get this (43:01 - 43:05)
because i want to get my shiny charm or (43:03 - 43:06)
whatever (43:05 - 43:10)
like i can see those reasons to go there (43:06 - 43:12)
and be like i just need to fill this out (43:10 - 43:14)
i just need to get it done because this (43:12 - 43:17)
game is making me (43:14 - 43:17)
frustrated (43:17 - 43:20)
yeah i mean like (43:21 - 43:26)
there's literally zero point to get the (43:23 - 43:29)
shiny charm in this game (43:26 - 43:31)
and if you're going to masuda method (43:29 - 43:34)
why in this game why not sword and (43:31 - 43:36)
shield unless maybe you specifically (43:34 - 43:38)
want a masood a method of carnifying i (43:36 - 43:41)
guess like (43:38 - 43:41)
this this is just the biggest problem (43:46 - 43:49)
with brilliant diamond shining pearl is (43:47 - 43:51)
like anything you want to do in it (43:49 - 43:53)
there's a there's another game out there (43:51 - 43:56)
that does it better yeah yeah (43:53 - 43:56)
yeah i it's i i mean it's a fun game to (43:57 - 44:02)
play through once and then (44:00 - 44:06)
put away and say i have my time (44:02 - 44:06)
i i'm not saying that gws (44:09 - 44:14)
shouldn't have been here (44:12 - 44:16)
i'm saying it should have been here (44:14 - 44:18)
before legends (44:16 - 44:20)
like when people were still interested (44:18 - 44:23)
like the why did it take so long (44:20 - 44:26)
like even legends had (44:23 - 44:30)
the daybreak or whatever update (44:26 - 44:30)
fairly shortly after that game came out (44:30 - 44:36)
and this game has been out since october (44:34 - 44:38)
so five months and we just got gws they (44:36 - 44:41)
had the the internet wasn't ready yeah (44:38 - 44:45)
they had to build the new internet yes (44:41 - 44:45)
i mean didn't they have to like (44:45 - 44:49)
they did have to fix the duplication (44:48 - 44:50)
issue yeah they had to fix like the (44:49 - 44:52)
weird duplication issue and some other (44:50 - 44:55)
bugs like (44:52 - 44:58)
let let's be real that game (44:55 - 45:01)
one of the few free from bugs (44:58 - 45:02)
so (45:01 - 45:06)
yeah yeah they were (45:02 - 45:06)
none from the start so i i get that (45:06 - 45:11)
there why people would be mad that they (45:09 - 45:14)
have to clear up the bug issue for a (45:11 - 45:16)
bug-free game like really diamond shiny (45:14 - 45:19)
pearl (45:16 - 45:19)
yeah (45:19 - 45:23)
um (45:20 - 45:23)
speaking of a bug-free game pokemon (45:23 - 45:28)
unite (45:26 - 45:28)
doraldon is now available (45:28 - 45:32)
uh (45:32 - 45:36)
look they add characters all the time (45:34 - 45:38)
usually when they add a character it's (45:36 - 45:41)
either not worth buying at all like (45:38 - 45:43)
treven it and then you play it takes (45:41 - 45:44)
driving (45:43 - 45:46)
and you play you play unite for like two (45:44 - 45:47)
weeks straight and then you finally see (45:46 - 45:48)
your first trevendent and you think to (45:47 - 45:50)
yourself (45:48 - 45:51)
oh (45:50 - 45:54)
i forgot this pokemon was in this game (45:51 - 45:55)
because literally no one is using or (45:54 - 45:57)
playing it (45:55 - 45:58)
or then they release a pokemon like (45:57 - 46:01)
doreladon which is just so overpowered (45:58 - 46:03)
yep yep (46:01 - 46:06)
and also unless it's just my ears (46:03 - 46:10)
their sound effects are really loud (46:06 - 46:12)
there's a lot of things happening in the (46:10 - 46:14)
game (46:12 - 46:16)
the sound effects are loud but have you (46:14 - 46:18)
run into the uh you can't see any of the (46:16 - 46:20)
pokemon (46:18 - 46:21)
uh and (46:20 - 46:23)
because that you can't actually pick and (46:21 - 46:25)
then timer runs out and it's randomly (46:23 - 46:29)
assigning you one um (46:25 - 46:29)
you're like i can't pick anything it's (46:30 - 46:33)
not letting me i guess i'm playing (46:32 - 46:35)
slowpoke are you sure you're not doing (46:33 - 46:39)
like a ram mode a a ram mode (46:35 - 46:43)
all random all-metal i mean (46:39 - 46:46)
i have i've sat in the lobby and watched (46:43 - 46:48)
a person hit the check mark and there's (46:46 - 46:50)
nothing in the box and i'm like well (46:48 - 46:52)
this is exciting fine we don't know what (46:50 - 46:53)
we're getting (46:52 - 46:55)
we don't know what this is actually this (46:53 - 46:57)
sounds great my favorite was when they (46:55 - 46:59)
added doraledon and they updated the (46:57 - 47:02)
game and they changed like buffs and (46:59 - 47:05)
then the game for switch players said (47:02 - 47:06)
you do not have enough (47:05 - 47:08)
i got that yeah storage you don't have (47:06 - 47:11)
enough storage (47:08 - 47:11)
so the fix because like (47:14 - 47:20)
not everyone is tech savvy (47:17 - 47:22)
not everyone like understands technology (47:20 - 47:25)
when i got the message of you don't have (47:22 - 47:26)
enough save data (47:25 - 47:30)
i went oh no no no i know i have enough (47:26 - 47:32)
data (47:30 - 47:35)
so i'm just gonna delete the app (47:32 - 47:37)
and then i deleted the app and then i (47:35 - 47:39)
re-downloaded it and was fine but (47:37 - 47:41)
that's the fix (47:39 - 47:43)
that is the fix but i knew people that (47:41 - 47:44)
were deleting like well i'm going to (47:43 - 47:46)
delete breath of the wild that's 20 some (47:44 - 47:48)
gigs (47:46 - 47:51)
there is no possible there's no (47:48 - 47:53)
possible way (47:51 - 47:56)
that i am out of i don't down i buy (47:53 - 47:58)
cartridges i have barely saved data so i (47:56 - 48:00)
went in and i'm like i'm just gonna (47:58 - 48:03)
check it's like you have 74 gigs of (48:00 - 48:06)
space i'm like (48:03 - 48:07)
i knew it (48:06 - 48:09)
so then around them real thick taking (48:07 - 48:10)
away (48:09 - 48:12)
well it's it's very heavy it's a (48:10 - 48:14)
skyscraper that's right for the speed (48:12 - 48:16)
bump especially when it's bent over (48:14 - 48:18)
um (48:16 - 48:19)
so i did yeah i was fine that's like i'm (48:18 - 48:21)
just because i know this is gonna take (48:19 - 48:23)
time to download so i waited until the (48:21 - 48:28)
evening and i i archived my data (48:23 - 48:30)
and i said this is gonna delete the game (48:28 - 48:32)
and i said that's fine and then i (48:30 - 48:34)
downloaded it and waited for the why (48:32 - 48:36)
this takes so long from your servers to (48:34 - 48:38)
update like half an hour for it to (48:36 - 48:39)
finally download everything and then (48:38 - 48:41)
it's worked fine what i always say it's (48:39 - 48:44)
worked fine except for the random (48:41 - 48:46)
you don't know who you're picking book (48:44 - 48:49)
and the music uh the sound effects are (48:46 - 48:51)
kind of loud right now (48:49 - 48:51)
they did a new battle pass too uh cowboy (48:55 - 49:00)
battle pass is over it is now um awful (48:58 - 49:03)
and the new one is so good i am so happy (49:00 - 49:07)

they got well i mean (49:24 - 49:27)
literally the coins were sitting there (49:26 - 49:29)
doing nothing because i didn't like the (49:27 - 49:31)
space one and i really didn't like (49:29 - 49:33)
frontier oh i like the spot that the (49:31 - 49:35)
space one was cool i thought you liked (49:33 - 49:36)
the cowboy one (49:35 - 49:41)
at me yeah because they have the chaps (49:36 - 49:45)
the taps never manifested plus (49:41 - 49:46)
the village people (49:45 - 49:48)
my champ leak (49:46 - 49:51)
save my money for that one for sure you (49:48 - 49:53)
don't even play machamp (49:51 - 49:56)

got it (49:56 - 50:00)
you don't know what you don't even know (49:59 - 50:02)
what i play (50:00 - 50:04)

what where there's an article that they (50:45 - 50:50)
put out like (50:47 - 50:50)
that (50:50 - 50:53)
i don't know when they put it out (50:52 - 50:55)
honestly they put it out okay so (50:53 - 50:57)
community day was on march 13th they put (50:55 - 50:59)
this out on march 12th (50:57 - 51:01)
we recorded march 12th (50:59 - 51:03)
but in the morning so i think this came (51:01 - 51:05)
out in the afternoon (51:03 - 51:06)
um (51:05 - 51:08)
and it says trainers we are happy to (51:06 - 51:10)
announce some extra bonuses coming to (51:08 - 51:12)
certain locations (51:10 - 51:14)
and then they said the yellow on the map (51:12 - 51:16)

and then blue is you can receive more (51:16 - 51:21)
items from spinning pokestops (51:18 - 51:23)
so mall of america was listed as the (51:21 - 51:24)
blue (51:23 - 51:26)
okay and it said trainers can look (51:24 - 51:28)
forward to more (51:26 - 51:29)
trainers can look forward to receiving (51:28 - 51:32)
extra items on every single pokey spot (51:29 - 51:34)
spin (51:32 - 51:37)
so in texas in austin texas that was at (51:34 - 51:38)
the texas capitol (51:37 - 51:41)
in bloomington that was (51:38 - 51:44)
hey fun fact mall america is technically (51:41 - 51:46)
not in minneapolis or or saint paul it's (51:44 - 51:48)
in bloomington (51:46 - 51:49)
uh (51:48 - 51:52)
boston it's at the boston commons (51:49 - 51:54)
fun fact that's where i proposed irene (51:52 - 51:57)
uh chicago was at millennial park which (51:54 - 51:58)
is (51:57 - 52:00)
where the fun fact i've been there (51:58 - 52:03)
first go fest failed (52:00 - 52:06)
uh there was okay so this was there was (52:03 - 52:09)
milwaukee wisconsin i was like milwaukee (52:06 - 52:12)
i used to live there where is this (52:09 - 52:13)
brookfield (52:12 - 52:17)
it no brookfield is its own city it's (52:13 - 52:20)
it's catalano square (52:17 - 52:23)
and i was like what is that sounds like (52:20 - 52:26)
you would live that was i know and i i (52:23 - 52:28)
looked at irene and i was like do you (52:26 - 52:29)
know where (52:28 - 52:31)
catalano square is and she's like i've (52:29 - 52:32)
never heard of that (52:31 - 52:34)
so i looked it up (52:32 - 52:37)
and it is it is not (52:34 - 52:38)
an (52:37 - 52:39)
it's not a park (52:38 - 52:42)
it's it's a it's just a fountain (52:39 - 52:45)
and it's the fountain in the third ward (52:42 - 52:47)
that is right outside of (52:45 - 52:50)
msoe which is the art school not sorry (52:47 - 52:53)
not msoe a mayad (52:50 - 52:55)
right outside of mayad and then there's (52:53 - 52:57)
an art supply store (52:55 - 52:58)
and the fountain is at the very end of (52:57 - 53:01)
the third ward and the third ward is (52:58 - 53:02)
like (53:01 - 53:04)
this just this strip of stores on either (53:02 - 53:06)
side and then in the middle it's just (53:04 - 53:08)
parking (53:06 - 53:11)
and i played there like that was my (53:08 - 53:13)
go-to spot (53:11 - 53:15)
to play and if (53:13 - 53:17)
if anyone saw my twitch streams when i (53:15 - 53:19)
streamed pogo it would always be in that (53:17 - 53:22)
area so that's like really cool (53:19 - 53:24)
that (53:22 - 53:26)
one they picked milwaukee but two they (53:24 - 53:28)
picked the they ultimately picked the (53:26 - 53:30)
third ward because that's what it is (53:28 - 53:31)
it's just like i never would have been (53:30 - 53:33)
cooler (53:31 - 53:35)
i never knew that that what that place (53:33 - 53:37)
was called it was just like oh this is (53:35 - 53:39)
just the water fountain that just sits (53:37 - 53:43)
here is there not a plaque by it no you (53:39 - 53:44)
don't there's no water in the water (53:43 - 53:46)
fountain it doesn't actually work like (53:44 - 53:47)
they haven't fixed it for like five (53:46 - 53:50)
years (53:47 - 53:50)
it's a bad water fountain it's not even (53:51 - 53:56)
i got coffee by there one time (53:53 - 53:57)
yeah there's a bunch of coffee shops (53:56 - 53:59)
down there (53:57 - 53:59)
but yeah there was there was a bunch of (54:02 - 54:05)
places for canada there was a bunch of (54:04 - 54:07)
places for the united states they did (54:05 - 54:09)
naperville new york northridge (54:07 - 54:11)
california island of florida (54:09 - 54:14)
sacramento san antonio san diego san (54:11 - 54:17)
francisco sand ford sanford florida (54:14 - 54:20)
savannah georgia (54:17 - 54:21)
stockton (54:20 - 54:23)
tuscan (54:21 - 54:25)
tuscan um (54:23 - 54:27)
tucson (54:25 - 54:29)
sure (54:27 - 54:29)
a bunch of places for a year a bunch of (54:33 - 54:36)
places for latin america (54:34 - 54:40)
i don't know if this is like a (54:36 - 54:40)
ongoing thing (54:42 - 54:45)
or (54:44 - 54:48)
how they got these (54:45 - 54:49)
i mean they probably have like they have (54:48 - 54:51)
to have like heat maps right like (54:49 - 54:52)
probably (54:51 - 54:54)
that's what i would imagine yeah we know (54:52 - 54:56)
that mall of america on community day is (54:54 - 54:57)
just (54:56 - 54:59)
but that's the problem with mall america (54:57 - 55:00)
isn't it always like that (54:59 - 55:03)
isn't the heat map always like red but (55:00 - 55:05)
no of pokemon go players (55:03 - 55:08)
right people logged into pokemon go at (55:05 - 55:10)
that location yeah (55:08 - 55:12)
yeah okay okay (55:10 - 55:15)
yeah boston commons uh was the best (55:12 - 55:17)
place to play in boston when i was down (55:15 - 55:19)
there (55:17 - 55:22)
that park is huge (55:19 - 55:22)
very big (55:22 - 55:25)
so i i guess we'll see if they do this (55:26 - 55:30)
again (55:28 - 55:32)
oh i imagine they'll try it again a (55:30 - 55:34)
couple more times sure i i guess i did (55:32 - 55:36)
notice i was getting more things from (55:34 - 55:39)
the pokestops but it wasn't like (55:36 - 55:41)
it was like nine pokeballs instead of (55:39 - 55:43)
like three (55:41 - 55:43)
i have to empty out my storage every (55:43 - 55:48)
single day i don't need more things (55:45 - 55:48)
please (55:48 - 55:51)

verse no i mean there could be but (56:21 - 56:27)
my nose is dripping because i have (56:25 - 56:29)
seasonal allergies and my allergy (56:27 - 56:32)
medicine hasn't kicked in (56:29 - 56:33)
this is it from al (56:32 - 56:37)
are you going to worlds in london (56:33 - 56:37)
i i want to say tentatively yes (56:42 - 56:48)
are you paying (56:46 - 56:50)
i know (56:48 - 56:54)
i mean i i mean i i i can i can go (56:50 - 56:57)
i can afford myself i don't know if (56:54 - 56:58)
one i don't know if my (56:57 - 57:02)
my wife could get off and two if she (56:58 - 57:04)
would even want to go and three if it (57:02 - 57:06)
would be i i have no clue i i don't know (57:04 - 57:09)
what the (57:06 - 57:09)
i don't know what a flight to london (57:10 - 57:14)
costs (57:12 - 57:15)
i said you know (57:14 - 57:17)
it's it's i've been giving it some (57:15 - 57:19)
thought and it's a difficult one for me (57:17 - 57:21)
because (57:19 - 57:24)
i mean yeah i would love to go but the (57:21 - 57:26)
other thing that sticks in my mind is (57:24 - 57:29)
i've always wanted to visit (57:26 - 57:30)
the great britain (57:29 - 57:33)
island the big one (57:30 - 57:33)
i don't (57:34 - 57:36)
want my entire visit to be pokemon (57:35 - 57:38)
worlds (57:36 - 57:40)
and i don't actually get to see (57:38 - 57:43)
the things people see i've never been (57:40 - 57:46)
to the uk at all (57:43 - 57:47)
um (57:46 - 57:50)
so okay i would like to go and i could (57:47 - 57:51)
probably afford it (57:50 - 57:54)
but i need to like know all the prices i (57:51 - 57:56)
would also need to like get (57:54 - 57:59)
on getting a passport right now (57:56 - 58:00)
but there's still a lot of questions i (57:59 - 58:05)
have about about it but i (58:00 - 58:05)
i would like going i would enjoy going i (58:06 - 58:11)
just don't know if (58:09 - 58:13)
because it's also right after gen con (58:11 - 58:14)
and i don't know that i'm going to gen (58:13 - 58:16)
con i don't i don't know a lot of (58:14 - 58:18)
factors that would ultimately make a (58:16 - 58:20)
decision about whether i can go to this (58:18 - 58:22)
or not (58:20 - 58:25)
well i think my desire is to go (58:22 - 58:27)
if i was to go (58:25 - 58:29)
so it's a four day event (58:27 - 58:31)
thursday friday saturday sunday (58:29 - 58:33)
i've been to (58:31 - 58:34)
three (58:33 - 58:35)
four world (58:34 - 58:38)
events and (58:35 - 58:38)
probably safe to say the community day (58:39 - 58:43)
will be on the 20th (58:41 - 58:44)
of august (58:43 - 58:46)
if we were to if we were to you know go (58:44 - 58:49)
to vegas and bet on black here probably (58:46 - 58:51)
very safe to say that community is going (58:49 - 58:53)
to happen that weekend (58:51 - 58:55)
um (58:53 - 58:55)
i think like (58:55 - 58:59)
i do agree with will if i'm going to go (58:58 - 59:01)
to london i don't want to spend all four (58:59 - 59:04)
days to be like pokemon only because (59:01 - 59:07)
there's no way they can make worlds (59:04 - 59:09)
it's very hard even for something like (59:07 - 59:10)
pax (59:09 - 59:14)
and uh greg and i will be at pax east (59:10 - 59:17)
even for something like pax (59:14 - 59:19)
you could get away with going for one or (59:17 - 59:20)
two days you don't have to go all four (59:19 - 59:21)
days (59:20 - 59:24)
unless you love waiting in lines and you (59:21 - 59:26)
want to play everything (59:24 - 59:27)
um (59:26 - 59:28)
but if i was to go to london i would (59:27 - 59:30)
probably want to go for like at least a (59:28 - 59:31)
week right (59:30 - 59:34)
get there a little early (59:31 - 59:35)
leave a little late (59:34 - 59:37)
like four days seems kind of short to (59:35 - 59:40)
fly overseas (59:37 - 59:42)
probably like like eight or eight to ten (59:40 - 59:43)
days (59:42 - 59:45)
minimum (59:43 - 59:48)
yeah that's a lot of money (59:45 - 59:50)
yeah because the hotel probably adds up (59:48 - 59:53)
those those i'm sure the uk hotels are (59:50 - 59:54)
not (59:53 - 59:57)
inexpensive (59:54 - 59:57)
um but yeah i would like to go i don't (60:00 - 60:04)
i don't know anything about (60:06 - 60:09)
europe (60:08 - 60:11)
right like when i went to japan i had to (60:09 - 60:13)
get a japanese sim card and that was (60:11 - 60:16)
actually pretty easy (60:13 - 60:17)
because you could order it online and (60:16 - 60:19)
then pick it up at the airport you were (60:17 - 60:21)
getting dropped off at so you would just (60:19 - 60:24)
get off the plane walk (60:21 - 60:27)
down the staircase and then look for the (60:24 - 60:29)
giant pink thing that said (60:27 - 60:34)
sim cards and then you just picked it up (60:29 - 60:34)
i mean i want to go (60:46 - 60:50)
i just don't know if i can (60:47 - 60:50)
but either way i need to get a passport (60:51 - 60:57)
i have a passport either (60:54 - 61:00)
look it's been two years since i've (60:57 - 61:02)
thought about going literally anywhere (61:00 - 61:04)
passport is not on the top of that list (61:02 - 61:06)
oh yeah and you know what if it was two (61:04 - 61:09)
years ago i would have been easy yes (61:06 - 61:10)
but (61:09 - 61:13)
time for five years (61:10 - 61:13)
what uh passport's like five years (61:14 - 61:18)
before we have to renew it (61:17 - 61:21)
oh i don't know (61:18 - 61:21)
i mean i haven't had a passport since i (61:22 - 61:28)
was 16. so i definitely have to renew it (61:23 - 61:30)
what (61:28 - 61:31)
what (61:30 - 61:32)
doesn't the uh (61:31 - 61:34)
minnesota (61:32 - 61:36)
state id let you go to canada was that (61:34 - 61:38)
called like real life new enhanced ideas (61:36 - 61:41)
i have allowed don't confuse the people (61:38 - 61:44)
there is a minnesota driver's license (61:41 - 61:46)
you can get that allows you to go to (61:44 - 61:48)
canada and to mexico for whatever reason (61:46 - 61:51)
that is not a real id the real id (61:48 - 61:54)
doesn't let you go anywhere (61:51 - 61:54)
the enhanced id does yeah the enhanced (61:55 - 62:02)
id does it's also your driver's license (61:59 - 62:06)
it does multiple things (62:02 - 62:06)
all right question off youtube (62:12 - 62:17)
uh this is from morgan i have a question (62:14 - 62:19)
years your passport has to have been (62:17 - 62:21)
issued within the last 15 years oh i'm (62:19 - 62:22)
good heavens (62:21 - 62:24)
no to but you still have to pay to renew (62:22 - 62:26)
it and you have to submit all the (62:24 - 62:27)
documentation and everything it's not (62:26 - 62:29)
it's it's not an easy problem they don't (62:27 - 62:31)
make it easy for you no they don't i (62:29 - 62:33)
need to get on this then oh (62:31 - 62:36)
to get a picture (62:33 - 62:37)
oh i can go to that old timey photo and (62:36 - 62:39)
i was just gonna say at the mall of (62:37 - 62:42)
america they do passport photos (62:39 - 62:44)
via cowboy for my photo (62:42 - 62:45)
we should both get that done the next (62:44 - 62:48)
time we go (62:45 - 62:50)
the old-timey photos uh i have a (62:48 - 62:52)
question mostly for greg and steve (62:50 - 62:54)
mostly for greg (62:52 - 62:56)
uh i am doing a re-listen of mythical to (62:54 - 62:59)
get my own d uh to get ready to dm my (62:56 - 63:02)
own 5e i don't know what 5e means (62:59 - 63:05)
edition oh 5e campaign not pokemon (63:02 - 63:07)
related was wondering if greg still (63:05 - 63:09)
creates his homebrew pokemon campaigns (63:07 - 63:10)
and if you (63:09 - 63:13)
uh if any of you still do dnd pokemon (63:10 - 63:16)
related or otherwise (63:13 - 63:16)
uh so (63:17 - 63:22)
i still do a bunch of home brew stuff (63:19 - 63:25)
yes i am running a game every monday (63:22 - 63:26)
um (63:25 - 63:29)
that's been going on (63:26 - 63:29)
for i think a year now (63:29 - 63:33)
that sounds about right (63:32 - 63:34)
um (63:33 - 63:35)
[Music] (63:34 - 63:37)
i mean i still play a ton of (63:35 - 63:39)
role-playing games i still (63:37 - 63:41)
i still do them for very random (63:39 - 63:46)
encounters uh i was going to update the (63:41 - 63:48)
pokemon trainer stuff but i really liked (63:46 - 63:49)
what i wrote and it's still very valid (63:48 - 63:52)
so i'm like oh this is fine at some (63:49 - 63:57)
point i will get back to redoing (63:52 - 63:57)
all the pokemon in in the correct (63:58 - 64:02)
formula so it wasn't so (63:59 - 64:04)
loosey-goosey like i had to make them on (64:02 - 64:06)
the fly but they were doing the show (64:04 - 64:08)
uh and at some point i will also get (64:06 - 64:10)
back to my pokemon mystery dungeon hack (64:08 - 64:14)
for 5v i just don't have (64:10 - 64:14)
like (64:14 - 64:17)
i don't make money off of that hobby and (64:14 - 64:20)
i have a 40 hour job (64:17 - 64:21)
so (64:20 - 64:22)
i'll get around to it but yeah i still (64:21 - 64:24)
heavily played (64:22 - 64:26)
all those things i'm still (64:24 - 64:29)
solidly in that world (64:26 - 64:29)
another quick question uh (64:30 - 64:35)
this was from robert (64:33 - 64:36)
would you rather have pokemon events be (64:35 - 64:39)
timed events as they are now or paid dlc (64:36 - 64:41)
where you can access them whenever you (64:39 - 64:44)
start a new game (64:41 - 64:44)
i mean that's kind of (64:46 - 64:49)
i think both like i feel like if you (64:47 - 64:52)
missed the manafee event because what (64:49 - 64:54)
was mana feed it was like uh (64:52 - 64:56)
first two months (64:54 - 64:58)
three months maybe (64:56 - 65:00)
this game came out on october (64:58 - 65:02)
or did it come on november (65:00 - 65:03)
um (65:02 - 65:06)
it was november i think it ended in uh (65:03 - 65:10)
february though yeah i think for those (65:06 - 65:12)
distribution types types of things that (65:10 - 65:15)
yeah having that false i mean the reason (65:12 - 65:17)
that they do it that way is you have to (65:15 - 65:18)
buy the game (65:17 - 65:20)
like up front right yeah they can get (65:18 - 65:22)
those early sales numbers that make (65:20 - 65:24)
everything look great (65:22 - 65:26)
um (65:24 - 65:27)
but (65:26 - 65:30)
yeah it sucks because then if you (65:27 - 65:32)
get the game later you can't get that (65:30 - 65:33)
one distribution (65:32 - 65:35)
yeah yeah it does like like i feel like (65:33 - 65:37)
a selling point of brilliant diamond (65:35 - 65:38)
shining pearl is like oh i could get (65:37 - 65:39)
manafee and fiona i don't have those (65:38 - 65:42)
pokemon and now it's like well you can't (65:39 - 65:43)
get them at all anymore they're gone (65:42 - 65:45)
like the egg is not here like you can (65:43 - 65:46)
get fiona i guess because you can just (65:45 - 65:50)
make a million peonies (65:46 - 65:50)
oh so that's like easy trade stuff (65:50 - 65:54)
i kind of wish that they had (65:55 - 66:01)
i kind of wish it did like the old eon (65:59 - 66:03)
ticket where (66:01 - 66:05)
if somebody had it (66:03 - 66:08)
you could pass that person and trade (66:05 - 66:10)
them that ticket and so that they could (66:08 - 66:11)
always access it because it really (66:10 - 66:13)
that was a really fun way to do (66:11 - 66:15)
interactions so i don't mind that it's a (66:13 - 66:19)
limited time i just wish that like (66:15 - 66:21)
if will missed it and i got (66:19 - 66:24)
you know the manafi ticket that we could (66:21 - 66:25)
trade a pokemon it would read the data (66:24 - 66:27)
and say oh you now have access to this (66:25 - 66:29)
because it would give (66:27 - 66:31)
more incentive to do in person trades (66:29 - 66:35)
and i would prefer that over a (66:31 - 66:39)
six months later here's a 299 (66:35 - 66:42)
ticket to have it why can't they just (66:39 - 66:45)
bring street pass back yeah i missed it (66:42 - 66:48)
i loved street pass (66:45 - 66:51)
it's like a fine line to walk but (66:48 - 66:53)
you know if you're picking up a pokemon (66:51 - 66:55)
game a year later and the darkrai event (66:53 - 66:57)
is over and the manatee event is over (66:55 - 67:02)
and the shaymin event is over like (66:57 - 67:02)
i feel like somebody who picked up a (67:02 - 67:06)
game a year later would would pay like (67:04 - 67:10)
five bucks to get those events back (67:06 - 67:10)
and it just sucks as there's no option (67:10 - 67:13)
for them to do it and this is why people (67:12 - 67:16)
resort to like action replay or i mean i (67:13 - 67:19)
i i i think my preferred method is to (67:16 - 67:21)
have it through a trade (67:19 - 67:25)
to have it through a signifier where (67:21 - 67:26)
it would flip the switch because you (67:25 - 67:28)
encountered or traded with a person (67:26 - 67:29)
locally (67:28 - 67:31)
that had it (67:29 - 67:35)
and it would unlock it for those games (67:31 - 67:37)
and (67:35 - 67:37)
i would rather have the encouragement of (67:37 - 67:41)
in-person stuff like it would tie into (67:39 - 67:43)
pokemon go day like people would bring (67:41 - 67:45)
their switch and be like okay let's meet (67:43 - 67:46)
up here and i've got the ticket and i (67:45 - 67:48)
can transfer it to your (67:46 - 67:50)
to your games i think that we i would (67:48 - 67:52)
prefer that way more than paying for it (67:50 - 67:54)
kind of like an easy mode in black and (67:52 - 67:55)
white too yeah like where you just met (67:54 - 67:57)
up with somebody and it's like oh i've (67:55 - 67:58)
got the key for hard mode and it (67:57 - 68:00)
unlocked it in somebody else's game and (67:58 - 68:02)
that kind of stuff i mean i like the way (68:00 - 68:03)
that monster hunter does it but i think (68:02 - 68:05)
their philosophy is different that they (68:03 - 68:07)
do the the tie-in (68:05 - 68:09)
events and everything like that (68:07 - 68:11)
to like be like well here's a reason to (68:09 - 68:14)
keep playing the game because now you (68:11 - 68:15)
know we have this sonic thing and you (68:14 - 68:17)
can run around the different map and (68:15 - 68:20)
collect gold rings and it's like (68:17 - 68:22)
the game came out a year ago but there's (68:20 - 68:24)
still like new events that are just fun (68:22 - 68:28)
to keep you engaged in playing the game (68:24 - 68:28)
yeah i think sword she'll do a great job (68:28 - 68:31)
with that (68:30 - 68:32)
with the (68:31 - 68:34)
raid rotation and stuff (68:32 - 68:36)
they would rotate the raids every month (68:34 - 68:37)
and then one week in a month they would (68:36 - 68:39)
have (68:37 - 68:43)
whatever featured pokemon (68:39 - 68:43)
uh (68:46 - 68:49)
pokemon of the week will all right so (68:47 - 68:52)
last week's pokemon i said that you (68:49 - 68:54)
would know the name of it until i asked (68:52 - 68:55)
you to remember what it was and then it (68:54 - 68:56)
would leave your brain because that's (68:55 - 68:58)
exactly what happened to me (68:56 - 69:02)
it's a three-letter pokemon (68:58 - 69:03)
and (69:02 - 69:04)
the (69:03 - 69:06)
word that it comes from can mean (69:04 - 69:07)
completely different things if you (69:06 - 69:09)
actually read the dictionary definition (69:07 - 69:10)
of it (69:09 - 69:13)
and also sometimes has the skill to gain (69:10 - 69:16)
the ability of a fallen comrade (69:13 - 69:19)
who's that pokemon (69:16 - 69:21)
[Music] (69:19 - 69:23)
rubbish (69:21 - 69:24)
no (69:23 - 69:27)
it's muck muck (69:24 - 69:29)
rubbish cannot have the power of alchemy (69:27 - 69:31)
it's also not three letters (69:29 - 69:33)
which is the weirdest (69:31 - 69:34)
abilities (69:33 - 69:36)
pokemon mew (69:34 - 69:37)
oh (69:36 - 69:40)
but if you say to somebody name name the (69:37 - 69:42)
three-letter pokemon from from kanto (69:40 - 69:44)
they're gonna be like (69:42 - 69:45)
can't do it (69:44 - 69:46)
it's just a minute (69:45 - 69:48)
there isn't anything (69:46 - 69:50)
but if you said name a poison pokemon (69:48 - 69:52)
from kanto they'd be oh they go writing (69:50 - 69:56)
grimer muck grimer wheezing (69:52 - 69:58)
greasing (69:56 - 69:58)
alolan muck (70:00 - 70:04)
pinnacle design i'm just going to put (70:02 - 70:06)
that out there right now (70:04 - 70:08)
i mean i love alola muk i but just like (70:06 - 70:10)
in looking into power of alchemy why did (70:08 - 70:12)
they have to make an ability that's like (70:10 - 70:15)
this ability is so cool and yet here are (70:12 - 70:17)
all the thousands it's like a coupon (70:15 - 70:19)
from a store it's like (70:17 - 70:20)
you can get the bus account if you can (70:19 - 70:22)
meet these fifty thousand restrictions (70:20 - 70:25)
we put on it (70:22 - 70:25)
shuffle icon great (70:25 - 70:29)
both shirts (70:27 - 70:31)
mike shares similar traits to wheezing (70:29 - 70:33)
and garb odor all three are pure poison (70:31 - 70:35)
poison type pokemon with a single (70:33 - 70:37)
pre-evolved form (70:35 - 70:38)
roughly the same base that totals and (70:37 - 70:40)
evolutions and they appear to be (70:38 - 70:42)
different kinds of pollution (70:40 - 70:45)
muck being water pollution (70:42 - 70:46)
uh (70:45 - 70:48)
muk is tied with mew as the shortest (70:46 - 70:51)
english name of all pokemon (70:48 - 70:51)
muk may be a pile of sludge whoa slow (70:54 - 70:59)
down bubble pedia (70:56 - 71:00)
it's not getting carried away here (70:59 - 71:04)
alolan muck might be an oil slick (71:00 - 71:05)
you know for people that hate on green (71:04 - 71:07)
shinies (71:05 - 71:09)
mucks shiny makes sense wow that's very (71:07 - 71:14)
good one of the rare circumstances there (71:09 - 71:17)
also in omega ruby alpha sapphire and x (71:14 - 71:18)
and y (71:17 - 71:20)
it does kind of look like it's giving (71:18 - 71:21)
you the finger (71:20 - 71:22)
[Music] (71:21 - 71:25)
a little bit (71:22 - 71:27)
and also to explain about the the word (71:25 - 71:29)
definition uh like muck is usually (71:27 - 71:31)
considered to be like dirty (71:29 - 71:34)
filth or whatever but to muck out means (71:31 - 71:36)
to clean something (71:34 - 71:37)
so (71:36 - 71:40)
there you go (71:37 - 71:40)
you know i'm not going to lie (71:41 - 71:47)
didn't know that the the hidden ability (71:44 - 71:49)
was actually called the power of alpha (71:47 - 71:51)
i just said it three times (71:49 - 71:53)
i know i thought you were just like (71:51 - 71:54)
maybe i just thought you saw (71:53 - 71:56)
like full metal this past week and you (71:54 - 71:59)

where they're at a college no no no well (72:18 - 72:24)
all right give us next week (72:23 - 72:27)
all right on one hand you could argue (72:24 - 72:29)
that pokemon with three evolutions are (72:27 - 72:31)
wasting space since no one really likes (72:29 - 72:34)
middle evolution pokemon on the other (72:31 - 72:36)
hand you could say there are way too (72:34 - 72:38)
many pokemon that only have two (72:36 - 72:39)
evolutions (72:38 - 72:41)
among fighting type pokemon (72:39 - 72:43)
many that start out as solely fighting (72:41 - 72:46)
type evolve to gain an additional type (72:43 - 72:48)
or there are also many examples of (72:46 - 72:50)
pokemon that gain fighting type for (72:48 - 72:54)
their secondary or tertiary evolutions (72:50 - 72:55)
it may surprise some of us to discover (72:54 - 72:57)
that of those that remain pure fighting (72:55 - 73:00)
type one two-member family may actually (72:57 - 73:03)
be based on weasels rather than cats (73:00 - 73:05)
