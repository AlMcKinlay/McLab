[Music] oh what's up everyone welcome to the 476 episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective i'm your host sbj with me is greg hello it's state fair time i will be going to the state fair tomorrow i have the day off and i'm very excited about it to eat all the bad foods and after this very recording i have to make my list of the things that i want to try so we don't waste time on things that are bad that would be a good tick tock right top 10 state fair things and then literally everybody else in minnesota does that also tic toc's a garbage platform and i don't know why you use it because i like garbage yes you eat garbage you ingest garbage both with your mouth and your eyes i make garbage and then you produce garbage for others to put into their eyes and ears it's just a bad cycle and i'm sad that i'm a part of it as will is also a part of it and i was going to say uh we actually need to re-characterize this podcast as it's not it's not steve gregon will it's the one who makes unfounded generalizations the one with unreasonable expectations or cheats at commander take your pick and i did not the one who's sane reasonable and correct i mean you cheated commander you were like i'm going to zap this and i'm going to zap that and i'm going to just jump this card here and then zap this out and then i'm going to dump this over here cheater i didn't i it was oh no there was all i was trying to do i had to make dinosaurs gathering and nobody wanted to let me make dinosaur cats nobody wanted me to let pull artifacts out of out of nowhere and put them on the battlefield i wasn't in that game and nobody wanted me to do oh to bring out angels including my deck because i couldn't pull it but no no steve he's literally greg gets to this one point in the game and he literally takes like a a dry erase board card draws a heart on it and says okay i can't be killed now well how is that not cheating it's because it was sierra's ultimate which you had warned everybody about and nobody did anything about it so i was like fine i'll take it i only have two other ways of doing that in that deck anyways only two other ways [Laughter] i feel like we all have i feel like we all have that friend that always cheats in every like tabletop slash board game the actually the but i mean yeah we're all friends with the same guy yeah the best play i made in that entire game was convincing everybody to go after vince cause vince vince is 99 the problem at the table vince was not necessarily the problem at the time i knew it i was a bigger pro at the table but y'all you are feel free to not learn magic we don't need you vince and i have already planned out the cat commander deck both cute cats you and you could be making cat dinosaurs yeah okay i'm back in i'm back into magic we have we have both types sexy and cute cats for a deck for you we've been working on this for months yeah but what about the pokemon trading card game it's garbage and the client is garbage and it's boring i can't play rosalia so i'm out what about the digimon card game it's also bad but did you see me opening those cards they looked so good when i was there you're like we're gonna do it later we well we did it we opened digimon cars and they're great there so no i didn't see it oh my goodness i know a store that has digimon so i can actually no it's like interaction i was playing magic with will and not cheating we got uh oh okay before we get to news it's a good transition uh so in card games sometimes you have to roll dice right yes correct and will will knows this really well um when we played the tcg competitively i would always import like japanese card sleeves and then i imported japanese dice and my friend andrew sent me some japanese pokemon dice so when you played pokemon competitively there was no you didn't ever have to roll a die but you could roll a die instead of flipping a coin and no one wanted to flip a coin because it was like no one knows in reality no one actually knows how to flip a coin you'd be like sitting across from the table and they'd be like struggling to put it on their thumb and then it would be like this really like uh weak flop and it would be really easy to weigh or to what was that called like way a coin yes like you should like shave off hat like half of it so it like more likely it lands on heads it's easy so cheat it dice wow so well well here's the very specific rules about dice and pokemon yes so instead of like flipping a coin for heads or tails you roll a dice if it's if it's even it's heads if it's odds the tail is pretty easy right so i my friend andrew sent me these po a pokemon dice that you got at the pokemon center and one was a pokeball and then one was pikachu so it was like six different pikachu expressions and then one was just like it was just like a pokeball and then five numbers and i would bring those to tournaments now the rule for play pokemon is your die you can use any dice you want but they had to be translucent you had to be able to see through them which obviously these pokemon center dice are and they had to have rounded edges you couldn't have um hard at straight edges and so i would bring these little two pokemon die to roll at my matches because they're you know they have pikachu on them why would you not bring them they're very cute not like barely anyone had them they were pokemon center official in japan and this is what every single tournament i went to and i went to them for three years the opponent would never care that i had these die dice until i rolled a heads that gave me the advantage and the win oh yeah so like we start off the match he'd be like heads or tails to start the match i'd be like tails i roll heads they'd be like all right i'm going first because you know they got it right and then i'd be like all right i'm using double slap roll the dice uh two tails that's zero damage your turn but as soon as i rolled away to like solidify that i'm probably going to win the game hand would go up and they would be like judge and they would call a judge over because they're strat oh gosh i'm getting so mad of this the strat was i was using custom die and that was against the rules and they didn't care but now that i'm winning they cared and i wish i was exaggerating but this was every single tournament and every tournament the judge would come over and they'd be like what's the problem and they would be like he's uh he's using custom dice probably got it off etsy or something and the guy the judges would thank goodness this was like the one thing the judges ever did right they would be like these are official pokemon center die they're they're tournament legal and they look very mad that don't what i'm saying is we're all playing magic the gathering and no longer pokemon i'm not gonna play this nightmare game i'm excited for you to join us on our commander nights i don't know it sounds like magic has some problems you're drawing hearts on cards and commander does away with a lot of the problems that's true this is true because cards don't go out of favor and you only have one copy of each it's super fun and they banned hull breacher before i could remove yeah they did well that was a bad card all right let's get into some pokemon news [Music] first bit of news here is the 25th anniversary is saved they did it august 26 pokemon.com pokemon tv app now available on the nintendo switch it's it's we saved it it's done hooray the application that has limited pokemon content is finally on the twitch i have never i i never feel as bad sad as when i look at my list of friends who are online and one of them is watching uh like the netflix app on the switch i thought netflix wasn't on the switch or the youtube app on the switch yeah like it's one of those two options netflix because a bunch of people were saying oh they got pokemon tv on there before they did netflix and pokemon is in netflix and whatever like look it's to keep kids entertained and so you don't have to give them your phone all the time okay let's be fair the trailer they showed they had two little kids in the tent and then they fell asleep and then the mom was like well no it's my turn and she put on gen 1. and i was like this is that was pretty good that's a pretty good trick i have no other options and my phone battery is dead i gotta take the switch i will say the little like 30 second trailer they made for it was pretty good they did show like they did do a range of like okay here's here's mom watching gen one here's kids watching alola and then they i think they showed maybe like 16 year olds watching i don't know like hoenn or something i don't know yeah um so it was a pretty good trailer uh it was funny we were we were talking about tic-tac before the um start of the episode but the i've just scrolled and the mom that was in that commercial she made a tick tock and then she was like oh these were my boys and this was like i was able to be the pokemon commercial it was really cool um i don't know if her other content was interesting but it was like cool to be like she was like genuinely excited she was in a pokemon um commercial uh it says pokemon tv is available on mobile devices and tablets and smart tvs you can now download the app on the nintendo switch fans have uh fans have the opportunity to swatch selected episodes and seasons of the pokemon series turning with ash from kanto to gallery and everywhere in between trainers can also brush up their pokemon tcg strategies by watching matt matches i don't i don't know if we ever talked about this but within like the last like year or so they put um like their official vgc and tcg matches on pokemon tv too which i mean you watch those on youtube as well uh library is always updating mo fun to watch additionally pokemon tv is launching a junior category offering videos for young pokemon fans and trainers um which are those like when we say pokemon is for kids there is actually like a toddler section of pokemon there's the kids kids section there's like the actual like toddler section you need to require the internet um kick off your day by downloading pokemon tv on the nintendo switch today i i mean whatever it's cool i should be on it also the pokemon trading card game should be on the switch but here we are it's when they come out with the revised one yeah aren't they getting a new pokemon tcg thingy with the stuff yeah well well i wish there was a lot to talk about here but there's not i mean i'm just been watching my diamond and pearl anime on my ipad like an adult so this was tweeted by a bunch of accounts but this is literally all the news we have it's a tweet but there's a retailer i think it was a spanish retailer there was a retailer listing for the new pokemon trading card game coming out which is called fusion strike and when they sh when they have like the little f uh information path pamphlet about fusion strike it says that there is um a new app pokemon tcg live due to come soon and that's that's all that's all we know we don't know if that's it it seems very unlikely that's like a typo because they're like right new app here's the new app's name pokemon tcg live it's not like they just called pokemon trading card game online tcg live which those are not that similar but they say new app and there's actually a an icon for it which uh the pokemon trading card game online icon is it's like a dark blue with a yellow border and then i think there's like a pokeball in the middle i don't even remember what it looks like but this new app is two little cards with pokeballs on them and then a light blue background so the icon is different the name is different and fusion strike is due out oh okay it's august october november fusion strike should be due out in november december i think every three months so that would be by the end of the year uh yes we are in agreement yep this is like the one thing i've wanted for a long time is it better that is not true there are many things that you've wanted for a long time but this is one of the things that you have been most vocal about wanting i'm not even like my team my tcg days are behind me right like only with that negative attitude i started playing the tcg when i was older than you are right now that's true like i don't think i would ever get back into like the competitive pokemon well like what about when your kids are going to pokemon tournaments and you're gonna their ears off and then as soon as i start losing i become rude and disrespectful and you start you also start cheating because it doesn't matter i'm just a poke dad what i do it doesn't count judge this ten-year-old is using illegal dice judge no no no no no this is the thing greg this is like one of the key things that drove me out of playing the pokemon tcg is like the poke dads are all in the masters group which is literally oh is it like 16 years old right yeah and when they're winning they take the game seriously when they're losing they cheat and they say things like well it doesn't really matter i'm just here because my kids are here yeah but but you have to the important part is that divide of cheating seriously doesn't happen until about halfway through the match exactly like the first like five minutes they're like buddy buddy with you like you're about to get like coffee with them after the match but like there's this hard divide where they either become serious and like don't talk to me or like bitter and i'm cheating now they have one human interaction given to them that's with an adult and not with children involved and you're a part of it and it's gonna go their way or they're gonna get cranky look if i was locked in the house with my children 24 7 and the one time i got to go out and play a game with a fellow adult it got bad heck yeah i'm cheating oh this is my one chance for glory before i have to go get to be stepped on by my children if you ever want to get a poke dad and and a pokemon let's this is it it applies to all if you seriously want to tilt them let them know that you're there and you don't have kids oh yeah that's my job that is my joy in life my joy in life is telling people who are trying to control their kids i go i made different life choices i can leave you now and i don't i can lock my dogs up at home and nobody calls social services on me because that's what you do to dogs you put them into a cage can't do that with your kids can you pokey moms much much more rarer than pokey dads but they are true that i have had some brutal pokemons they will like i feel like the poking the pokey dads like they get like huffy and puffy but the pokey moms they will tell you right to their face that they are unhappy that they can't believe they're losing to you heck has no fury like a pokemon score they are there they make you rethink what you're doing with life um pokemon tcg live good name very simple understand hopefully this is a new app there's a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of speculation here is it going to import everything from pokemon trading card game online probably it seems like it would be pretty easy to import your database the fact that pokemon trading card game online has existed since 2012 i believe it is 11 years 10 years old whatever a decade old the fact that that app even works is a miracle if that app can remember all of your cards i am sure that it's just some excel csv that you can export and then import into i mean the new one that's where janine went after she left pokemon go calendar she moved over to databasing on the excel spreadsheet so so like is this a new app is it making by is it being made by direwolf digital is it going to be able to import your stuff is it going to be restricted to uh ios android is there a pc app is there a mac app is it coming to the nintendo switch i'm excited but there's too many questions at this point i know somebody who works at the pokemon company international who really really loves a particular type of omelette that you can get at ihop i think they can be persuaded to spill the beans what i know what you're talking about uh when i talk when i talk to them he's like i know who you're talking about when i talk to them when i talk to them at worlds which was too long ago gave him a hug i was like good to see you again and i was like i know you can't say anything but the pokemon trading card game online is hot trash and they said yes we know they they winked they they double wink and elbow tap tell no one about what i'm about uh brandon from our slack sent in the pokemon tv chris from our slack sent in the pokemon um you got to be more specific about the brandon because there's like eight brandon's they know who they are who they are they know who they are okay um will is active in the conversation so let's not do pokemon masters otherwise we're going to lose will for the rest of the show no that's do what you need to do so many people on twitter that now you guys are having twitter conversations about pokemon masters i only see half of them half because i blocked the other half of the conversation sorry oreos lovers made your own choices our audience gets so excited to talk to will and greg no no one in our audience is excited to talk to me correct nobody really reaches out to me they reach out to will and then will's like block but with a good reason but will is no good reason and i'm like the nicest person wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait if i literally say this is the problem people don't understand that i i i'm not a euphemizer if i say on twitter if you send me pictures of oreos where half of it is chocolate and the other half is vanilla i will block you and then you send me a picture of an oreo or half as chocolate and staff is vanilla the next thing that happens is i block you i i wasn't making that up people get so excited when will pops in the twitch stream and he ignores all of them that is not true which like i understand that is not true i get tilted because i make jokes in the twitch stream and you ignore them oh and then i'm like oh steve's just going to ignore me i'm not i'm out for this i that is that is not true what i'm saying is you ignore us all the time happened last night you were you sound like 50 percent annoyed that i bothered to come in because you're like this isn't sunday i want to talk to you no i love when you guys come in i love it i really do i'm just saying that anyways if you reach out to the nice person me i will talk to you don't go to the mean person yeah whoever that is uh pokemongolive.com season of mischief okay we we have a we have a lot to talk about let's let's get the season of mischief out of the way first because that will that will be from september 1st through the rest of the year because seasons are four months four months three months four months three months three months four in a 12 month period and that's three uh trainers strange events in pokemon go continue in the season of mischief the season will focus around the adventure of featuring hoopa the mischief pokemon which you will be able to encounter early in this season's special research story misunderstood mischief when hoopa summons a legendary pokemon pokemon go when hoopa summoned the legendary pokemon in pokemon go go fest time and space were distorted hoopa also brought pokemon originally discovered in the gala region to go for the first time be sure to follow along during the season to see what else will happen this will go from september 1st through december 1st and you will be able to access parts of the season's special ripper story when certain events begin the special research story will focus on discovering more about hoopa and the strange occurrences happening throughout the season so stay tuned and follow along the story if you complete the season's special research you will gain access to a special event at the end of the season that might have something to do with hoopa hoopa can not be transferred to pokemon home for now trainers unable to play during the season confined hoopa may be available again in the future so let's start here not a lot of people have hoopa um i don't know mcdonald's like 500 yeah like what was the problem here i did it i wouldn't get into mcdonald's parking lot not getting their food because gross and did my stuff on four different cartridges and then i left uh there was two hoopa distributions one was the mcdonald's one one was the year of mythical one i believe yeah correct so this would be the third mythical distribution technically i guess uh i don't think that transferring to home is that big of a deal because it literally says something will happen at the end of the season and i'm assuming you're probably going to need hoopa to like i i'm guessing one of the tasks is like take a picture of hoopa and then once that like research is probably over you'll be able to transfer it so i don't think it's the end of the world um oh in that regards because hoopa is destroying the world with his hoops because they they do say um hoopa cannot be transferred to pokemon home for now so i think we're good there uh the revamped pokemon go live is like lays this out very well uh and they they they updated it where instead of being like you can find jigglypuffs slowpoke chickarita they have like little pictures of them so it it's very nice uh what do we have here so we have the season of mission begin hoopa will play pranks on the team leaders and professor willow by taking his glasses it is up to you to learn more about the mischief pokemon why is it so mischievous and what else does it have in store for the season i complete the seasonal special research to catch hoopa on sunday september 5th strange a strange phenomenon will be happening around the world and then it says the following type of pokemon will be attracted to incense so oh so they're doing that thing so on september 5th they're doing the like from 11 to 12 you have attracted psychic pokemon from 12 to 1 you attract like dark pokemon uh and so you'll have like execute jinx natsu spoink girafford muna beldum for the psychic hours and for the ghost and dark you'll have alolan ratata pucciana duskul perloin sable eye carvana and then drifloon and if there will be a collection challenge during this time the collection challenge will reward you with hoopa candy and the pokeball lift aviator pose you will also earn twice the candy from transferring and you will have a free bundle of incense in the shop and if you complete event exclusive research you will earn rare candy and a variety of pokeball types pokeball lyft avatar pose what is it so avatar was one correction uh although i suspect that maybe aviator is in there are you sure is it no it's not just the word is mischievous mischievous mischievous no there's no extra eye in there i am out for mischief i'm mischievous okay whoo god look at our education lessons are young folks listening to this program i want them to learn words the right way ah so for this season the northern hemisphere we'll get jigglypuff slowpoke chicorita cyndaquil potadile b doof and summer sorry autumn deerling i'm sorry greg the southern hemisphere so mad about this this is getting like this very worst resilient that's the worst navy south in the south they have summer there don't they right now uh no right now they are going into spring spring because they're coming out oh they're going into spring um they have snivy ted pig time pool and uh spring oh that makes sense spring gearing he's bringing out them and then they're putting they're putting the nittorans barboach and drifloon in 2k eggs and more they're putting steel pine co sableye chingling in 5k eggs they're putting autuno and mean foo into 10k eggs adventure sync is still bad i have something to say about this but adventure sync for 5k they're putting in the shield on um cranidos crane craney dose kranidos and then frillish and then the 10k is ryolu dino noibat i also don't like what they're doing with mega evolution here there's they're giving a whole month to slow bro a whole month so the slow bro september gengar's october hey for the first time they did ghosts in october good job took him five years the 25th anniversary saved hound doom in november i think that's like i i just i i i'm not a hundred percent sure what they're thinking with this maybe i'll ask them but like people already don't like mega raids because they would rather spend their raid passes on a legendary raid which i get i i can see both sides i mean maybe the thought process is like one or two weeks isn't enough and then people feel like well the week's almost over they need to do three slow pokes so if we do the whole month maybe like they can at least do one a week and by the end of the month they have everything but like for me i'm i'm like literally literally 10 candy away from mega evolving altaria and i'm just thinking like that's 90 days of me still not getting mega altaria walk with like no because you can't walk with it until once you make of all this here's the thing the thing that is throwing me off is their three month seasons are different than what i'm used to at work so i expected this to be october november december because you're closing out the year but there's a september october november and i'm like yeah this is this is weird why are you doing it i mean it's fine it just is weirding me out a lot well technically winter does start in december they're they're really not long december 21st the end of december there are 10 days left of december that are winter yeah i mean i guess they can like do events to be like hey this weekend mega altaria spawning or something it just they could just make a general mega candy can you just make a general mega candy that can be applied to all of them just after raids have it like be the raid candy and you can choose which mega you want to apply the candy to yeah i i think problem solved 25th anniversary saved i i genuinely like megas in pogo like it's so much more interesting than they were in like x and y in x and y the only thing you could do is like mega evolve roast that caterpie on a root and then like mega evolve against the elite four and then like mega evolve in like pvp battle that's all you could do in those games like unless i'm wrong i don't think you like mega evolve and then like do that x and y soccer mini game right correct where like you could only make it yeah i don't even remember the soccer minigame what i played the heck out of that that's the only way to get some of the uh like evolution items that you need man you bring talonflame into that game heck yeah that soccer mini game was like mostly for ev trading wasn't it uh well it did that too but the you would get rewards for different like yeah if you if you needed some evolution items you could get them yeah easiest way to get them was as rewards for playing that game i thought we were talking about because i was thinking black and white of it's in boston city that has the soccer field or the baseball oh yeah i was like what mini game was there baseball and basketball yeah yes whatever what that was sports and sports you couldn't hear you whatever even like mega involved sir i'm not black and white was great whatever brings sports like you couldn't even mega evolve and like pet them right like pokemon refresh or me you couldn't yeah i don't remember you could do it it was only in battle so like when you mega evolve and go they like well i get you could walk with them they could follow you you get the bonuses when you catch they're great for team rocket battles they're great for raids like you can take pictures of them i like i like it i like it a lot it feels like a good use of the eight hours i'm into it but no one else cares about no no no one else cares about megan no nobody does okay dino transformations there seems to be species where okay so ditto can be a ghastly uh uh uh drowsy uh remembered a teddy ursa gulpin a new number numo uh it's the stunt the the the stunk i can't remember that thing's name bubble stunky did say that so some of these pokemon can be shiny so like drowsy ghastly level they can be shiny if they're shiny they cannot be ditto so they did fix this so if you if you find a shiny drowsy you don't have to worry about it turning into a ditto what is it it wouldn't even turn into a shiny did it would it it'd just be like i don't think so i can get clarification on that but i saw like three content creators i'll tweet that like hey if it's shiny it can't be ditto if ditto is shiny when in the regular game and then it transforms into the opponent does it stay shiny i don't think so that's silly i know ditto your shiny ditto in pokemon go i believe turns into the shiny version oh does it i think so i don't know i don't i don't think it did i don't think it does in the game does it i don't know the thing that they need to change in the main series games is when the ditto transforms into the other pokemon it still needs to have the ditto face that would be that is an anime specific thing only then yeah but i'm so into it it's so good only that ditto was bad at being a ditto i like bad ditto i'm into that okay uh that is the part one of the season of mischief i think for a lot of i would i would assume or maybe hope for a lot of people that are maybe like casual pogo or maybe they took a break from pogo i i feel like hoopa is a pretty good draw um i mean like it's a mythical not a lot of people have the mythical or people do but the people who don't have the mythical really like to remind you that they don't have it and they're still looking for it i understand it sucks when you're missing one pokemon um and it seems i mean usually a special research story is well they say season long special research story well so we'll see i know there was a huge debate about like hey i paid ten dollars to get shiny mew and now this task takes me like three months but they also said that that was supposed to be long i mean well they didn't say it's supposed to be long but they kind of like it will be long they hinted that it's going to be long so we have more pokemon go news and we're going to talk about the distance stuff which was you know a big thing from two weeks ago because we skipped it last week so we will be right back [Music] hey uh what do you guys think about pumpkin spice pumpkin spices pumpkin spice frosting flakes pumpkin spice pumpkin spice mini wheat pumpkin spices [Music] nice [Music] and we are back from our break coming in september okay so season of mischief three months uh they're changing some things here every monday in september you're gonna get one uh one coin bundle giving you a free remote raid passes and some other stuff so that's back that's cool uh nature is healing because lugia will be back in raids finally it's been so long who at this point playing pokemon go has not done at least 21 i'm sure ho o is right around the corner here ho o is always around the corner where there's the lugia there's a ho um lugia will have the attack aerial blast will appear from september 1st through september 14th uh this is how i'm not falling i'm not i'm done i'm not falling for it ooxy mesprit and as elf will be appearing in five star raids between the 14th through october 1st they will be shiny this time around i think this is the third time this could be shiny they could be could be if you're lucky they could be only if you're lucky if you're not lucky you're not never that lucky so uh they introduced the like spirits initially right to their respective region my spirit is europe middle east africa india as elf is america and greenland shout out to maybe the two people we have in greenland that listen to the podcast uxi is the asia's pacific area first time there was no remote raid passes you just did them second time they came around you could remote raid pass into them this is the third time you can remote right past they could be shiny i really personally don't think it's that different than anyone else i mean people are like oh it's region specific but i i feel like most of our audience at least our audience is just remote raid pass central so what does it matter if it's like they're using remote rate passes for zashi and they're using remote raid passes for dialga so it's really i mean there are a lot of people that use it i think it's helpful when you can get it for a coin because people have been inviting me and i'm like i'm out of passes so no it is definitely helpful to be like i'm only going to use my free raid pass if you want to join me that's fine i'm not spending money but you can also psa if you invite me to a remote raid and i go and i invite you yeah no and i invite you to remote raid and you don't show up well now we're going to have words friends just if you're going to invite me give me a heads up on something other than the game because it's always so delayed and i get the message and i'm like well i'm sure i got this after the time of joining that lobby is over because it is not good at updating me so just hey instagram twitter slack wherever you can find me say hey do you want to do this roadway page i'm going to invite you and i can say yes or no i just i am i just can't i just cannot care about the lake spirits enough to be like i'm gonna shiny hunt these i mean there was a point in pogo where they were introducing like one shiny every two weeks or like one shiny a month and i would be like oh cool shiny hat pikachu party hat pikachu i'm gonna go out after stream i'm gonna go to the third ward in milwaukee i'm gonna i'm gonna walk around for a couple hours because i'm gonna get pikachu non-stop i'm gonna get the shiny and then i'm gonna be like never have to do that again and then they released too many shinies and then i stopped doing that where it's like i just can't care about shiny geo dude at this point releasing three legendary shinies in a two-week period i j i just can't it's been a full week i haven't even done a zama sense yet

time we get two no i think charizard had something with like dragon breath or oh probably something like this whatever it doesn't matter um hoopa's one day event will take place sunday september 5th we talked about that that's the psychic then the rose then back to the psychic the psychic spectacular will start on wednesday september 8th through september 13th some familiar faces will be returning and another pokemon will make its pokemon go debut which will it be here's a hint be careful of revolving too much of your life around one thing you might find that it could overturn at a moment's notice am i dumb what is this alcremy overturn he's not psychic does it have to be psychic yeah it's the same spectacular pokemon of the week clue again is niantic stealing your content well yeah i know absolutely or maybe they secretly okay so it says it's debuting during the psychic spectacular right the hint is be careful of revolving too much of your life around one thing it could overturn at a moment's notice um and i feel like we're limited to gen 6 pokemon and gen 8 because they skipped channel 7. i wish i had more time to think about this before we started the show i didn't read that one line i i mean wait i'm trying to go through what is in the game now because er solos this is in the game yeah celestis is in the game yeah but that's not about revolving or overturning pumpkaboo no let's go because it's a dark and psychic and ghost event yeah yeah so wait what is the over the overturn is probably turn your phone upside down also malamar is the overturning pokemon yeah that's its species oh well well i thought it was gonna be something exciting and that was just in k and in case it's not that becomes a cthulhu nightmare and we talk about amazing but also like a pokemon that has like interesting ability it's an interesting typing it's it's it does cool stuff can we talk about the actual good gen 6 pokemon which is fur fruit what what what about it perfect is great yeah yeah was that normal type gym leader thing was that a tick tock or was it an instagram reel uh yes it's on all of them oh dang that was really good that was very good i send steve good things he's like it's too long like listen here short attention span theater yeah oh yeah i need i need a short okay so fashion week is coming stylishly dressed pokemon will be making their debut along with fluffy and fashionable for fruit yes stuff with these fashionable styles new ev the reason okay so when real talk when gen 6 came out i didn't really like furfuru didn't really get it the thing that really sold me on fur fruit was when the ultra recon squad had a fur fruit and they didn't understand it and then they like if you didn't have the right pokemon that fur fruit was almost unbeatable because of its ability because it had like super super high defense and you were like level 14. i mean the fur fruit couple in x and y are the nuzlocke enders because fur fruit is a beast um so the fashion week is september 21st through september 28th what do you mean you didn't get it it's a super cute ass it's a super cute fluffy dog oh it's a poodle it's not an afghan yeah it's a poodle i just say there's a napkin it could be but it's it's a poodle team rockets boss seems to me missing something where's giovanni gone we hope he's not planning something in the shadows be sure to keep an eye out for an update throughout the season super rocket radars will not be available to track down giovanni during the time so no need to keep them equipped there is also a new evolution preview coming battlers rejoice you will soon be able to preview your pokemon's post evolution cp before you evolve it this new evolution screen will display the following the current pokemon and cp the pokemon's evolution and its new cp and which leagues the evolved pokemon would be qualified for this new feature will go live sometime in september we hope you better we hope it will help you better determine which pokemon to power up i love this the it still doesn't fix the problem of locking yeah there needs to be a way to lock a pokemon so you don't accidentally power it up or you don't accidentally evolve it where you can like tag it and that tag locks it of like this is only great league you can't accidentally overpower it you can't accidentally hit the evolve button i don't know it doesn't say that it does that but i feel like that is the thing i need is oh i why am i keeping this certain squirtle i tagged it gbl but then i accidentally transferred it or accidentally like powered it up too much i don't know maybe that's just a me problem and i feel like a problem i don't i don't battle league until i have to and i go in and do my one thing and like thanks i'm out okay so those are all the changes with uh the the season of mischief uh i did go to the niantic task force meeting they i am allowed to talk about it you probably saw other content creators slightly talk about it the one thing i'm i'm gonna give it to greg and well to ask me questions because i'm not sure exactly what to say that i haven't already said but the only thing i'm not allowed to say is who i talked to there were a bunch of niantic people i'm not allowed to give their names or give away who they were that was the one request that niantic said i have had plenty of meetings with niantic before uh for whatever reason niantic is a weird company they didn't really want us to talk about it in this situation because of i guess maybe the blowback they were like you're allowed to talk about this this is just the rule you're this is just our one request um maybe it's because people on twitter then go after yeah but that's probably why actually uh i mean liz liz has left the company uh i don't we talked about this before i don't think it's because of the issues obviously you know when you work for a tech company for three four five years really the only way to move up is by going to a different tech company this is kind of all jobs honestly not really limited to tech so i think at this point it's kind of har i would assume that the people i'm talking to they probably don't have a twitter presence or don't want people to find them on twitter niantic reversed the decision of the 40 back to 80. it was specifically they they only rolled out the the revert they they reversed it only in america and in new zealand new zealand a very small country of course and they la like a couple days before the america one they switched back it in new zealand first and then america was the only country that had the 40 to 80. before i tell you what niantic told me uh wait and 40 to 80 means from you had to be 40 feet from a pokestop in order to be able to interact with it to 80 feet from no technical leaders technically 20 because the 40 is the diameter diameter okay so it's 20 all around but now it's within 20 feet of a pokey stopped meters i don't know what a meter is in a foot is one meter one three feet to a meter just about okay so one meter is three feet so they went from 60 feet to interact with a pokey stop to 240 feet to interact with a poke stop that's a lot of feet not no not 240 120 feet 60 to 120. there you go roughly i mean it's a little bit more but whatever so i think some of the some of the problem with the lack of communication is people wildly speculate of why these things were made um and it did bother me that the thing i saw a lot was like the reason that niantic went from 80 to 40 was because of sponsored stops and sponsor stops made their money and then when this when this reversed they were like see it was about money and it's like that doesn't make your logic three weeks ago about how it was sponsored stops and your logic now about how it's money doesn't make any sense because even even if you think like well they reversed it because of money spoiler they didn't if you if you're if you sincerely believe they reversed it because they didn't make enough money in the last three weeks what are you one you have to be american because you have to be so selfish and so clueless that this is a worldwide game and only like yeah i guess you could include new zealand but new zealand is so tiny compared to the rest of the world but like you have all of china you have all of japan you literally have the entire world still at 80 and you're saying that america had like don't get me wrong i'm sure america's top three maybe top five countries that make money for niantic but also they reversed it in a time where there was like no shiny dark cry no shiny deoxys like there wasn't really a lot happening like this last month where people would be like they already spent all their money on dialga and palkia like i ca i cannot imagine and again niantic told me it wasn't about money it was i can give you the reason in a little bit but the speculation was like oh this was all about money but your your logic of the beginning of it now the end of it just doesn't make sense right it is not a logical conclusion but i mean people aren't looking for logical conclusions and when you told me the reason i also said that's not a logical reason it's not it's it's it's i mean i disagree with greg on that when you told me the reason it made me so angry it still makes me angry i think a lot of i think at the end of the day everyone's human and everyone makes dumb decisions and there are plenty of huge companies apple microsoft mine whatever that make terror make sense they make dumb decisions yes and uh and so here here's their reason and when they when they said it to me i was like this makes sense even though it's i'm not defending it it is still dumb but it at least made sense so they were they started off the meeting and they said one before they even told us the reason they said one of the most frequently uh got asked questions was is this because of sponsored pokestops and they said no it wasn't and they said i'm paraphrasing here they said po sponsored pokestops is a small part of our business and it had and it had nothing to do with this decision at all which we've said on the show before that i don't we i said i don't think it's sponsored pokestops because what when what was the last new sponsored pokestop you saw in america name one like i remember the starbucks deal i remember the sprint deal that like i thought i saw a variety they had like a they had like a two-day grubhub thing at one point like what like i thought it was doordash was it grubhub whatever oh no there was whatever one of those i'm sure they'll buy each other eventually so their lot their reasoning for changing it back was two things number one it's the the reason that everyone had is well it worked for four years and people played the game and i i i do get it from that aspect of like we want to get back to where that was because that's what the thing that worked but i think we all can agree now that nothing will ever be the same with covid right like there is no well and it there there is there's there is no like definite end date to covey there's no definition right any of it but also it's like saying you all liked hms for seven generations so for generation nine we're going back to hm's because it worked goodness i miss the hm so like it is such it is it is one of those things where i'm like when you make an improvement and people really like it to go back and say well it worked for four years so why don't you like it now it's like because we saw a better world we got a better thing and saying i agree with you guys four years is so infuriating but that's not the one that really makes me mad and and that's what bothered me about omega ruby off of sapphire it's like you introduce character customization you start to get rid of hms and it's like well we did this because that's how the gen 3 was and when you we want you to live through it again and it's like no i don't want to live through that again you you figured it out over the years why are we doing and that's why i was so excited with diamond pearl is like cool you brought back character customization i mean it's not the end of the world it's not the biggest thing we don't know about hm that's good feedback so so to be fair and i will say this i'm not defending niantic i'm just trying to be transparent as possible because niantic is very bad at the transparency i don't know if the people i talked to in the meeting were the actual decision makers right they just gave me their reasons they just talked it out true i can't tell you how many people i talked to or who was in this zoom call but i don't know if the people there were like hey this was our decision or hey we have like 18 bosses that said we had to do it this way i don't know i don't know that but they said okay so here's the actual reason besides the like well it worked for four years let's go back to that the actual reason is they showed us a picture of a pokestop uh on like like somebody at niantic walked to this pokestop they stood 20 meters away i'm going to say 20 meters because remember it's not 40 meters because that's the circumference or whatever it's radius not diameter diameter so they stood 20 minute meters away from this horse stash 2 and then they took a picture of it and then they walked 80 me 40 meters away because 80 is the new distance and they took a picture of it down the street they were in like some like small downtown area and you couldn't see the horse stash to you because they were down the street and then they took it from like the east side and you couldn't see the horde statue at all because the lot there was like a library or a building in the way and then they showed another thing so their logic and again this makes sense even though greg disagrees with it their logic is hurry i don't agree with it either but i have a different reason why i don't agree with it than greg does their logic was our our game is you in the real world interacting with pokestops and if you cannot see the pokestop that doesn't really make sense because like you're spinning the horse statue but you can't see the horse statue so that's why the four they that's why they wanted the 40 instead of the 80 because if you can't see the stops they're spinning how are you like interacting with it and we're like okay so what we took away from that is you have a worldwide game you want people to go outside we get that and so your distance was based off can i see the object i'm spinning and yeah if you're 80 there could be a building between you and the thing so you don't know exactly what you're spending based off of that i have been in corporations for 25 years and i can smell we need to justify this decision line and that's what that is because in my own hometown i can show you monuments that i can see from an 80 meter distance clear as day and i can show you monuments that you cannot see until you're on top of it and what that is and what infuriates me about it is there is no way they went to every monument in the entire world and said the average is 40 meters they had to make a decision they made it at 40 and said okay here's our justification for it which is not a great justification because of two things one there are plenty of examples where you can see it and you can't and two it's not a barrier it's not like i run into a force field at 40 meters and can't get any closer if i want to interact with that item guess what i can make the choice to get closer and see it you know what i don't need i don't need to get closer to the buddhist temple that i have passed by that's one block from my house that i have passed every day for five years that this game has been out i don't need to explore it at 40 meters anymore i've seen it what am i seeing that's new nothing we are five years into this game people all will explore when they're out in the world looking for new things the reason that oh it's 40 minutes and that's the ideal thing is false and easily disproven two i get to make the choice i get to get closer if i want to so how about which is what we've complained about all the time incentivize me to get closer make it so that i get one set of rewards at 80 meter and one a different set of words at 40 and maybe a different set of rewards when i'm closer and actually interacting with it like like i understand five years ago you had to make a choice but that choice doesn't it's five years later people are in their hometown you actually have to run research to get people to go out and find new locales because we haven't been able to travel for two years people who have probably explored all of their city multiple times in the five years that they played this game it is such an it is such a limiting idea and what it is it is a thing that i run into corporations all the time it's why it enrages me because it's like we had to make a decision this is the decision we've made and we've never thought about it again yeah and it's it's infuriating because again i can get closer i can get if if something i've never seen before and i can't see it at the 80 meter distance i get to walk closer and find it what also happens is sometimes they're in locked buildings and i can't get in there because it's locked yeah i you need to report that pokey stop and have them remove it what if they'd what if they came back and they said no we've actually done scientific research and discovered that 40 meters is the tipping point where if we set it at 40 meters then the majority of people will go and investigate and look at the thing that is the pokestop be transparent with your studies i i will say that like i see where they're coming from in the sense of i have explored new areas of milwaukee because of this game so like i have never walked down the street or i didn't know this building was here and that is purely because of pokemon go so like the logic of like well you know you can see it here you can't see it here this is why we agreed on the distance this is what i told them and i think greg and i kind of shared the same thought here is i said to them i don't care if it's 40 or 80. i want to be rewarded for exploring and i don't feel like i am getting rewarded for exploring if i can sit on my couch and spin two poke stops and and pop an incense and catch a bunch of pokemon and remote into 14 raids this week and not leave my house why would i if you want people if if the core of your game is walking and getting people to go out why do i feel like i am not getting anything more than the people sitting on their couch so like to me it doesn't matter if it's 40 or if it's 80 or if it's 20 if your game is rewarding me for going out and exploring i will go to that pokestop and i will walk past it and i will then keep walking because i want the rewards you're giving me um and they were took down the notes and everything i will say yeah i will say that like there are other content creators in that meeting and the thing that kind of stood out to me is a couple of them said like no one leaves or goes out because of pokestops so just make it 80. and i thought that was kind of weird because i feel like sometimes hardcore players get in this mindset of like well i've explored my city a million times and i don't care about the horse statue down the street at pf chang's it's like yeah i mean i get it you don't care because you live there but the reason i have explored is literally because that pokestop has a ring that i've never been to and so i'm going to walk to it because i want to because i know i haven't been there because the ring is there and i want the experience and i would assume that these like heart maybe maybe the ones i don't wanna i'm not gonna say who they were maybe they were battle heavy people so they don't care that much about exploring or catching and they only explore they only care about gbl or raids but i would i disagreed with i mean i didn't like like unmute my like self on the call and there's a lot of people in the call but i was like but poke stops are why i explore i mean like if i've never been to it i'm going to go to like it's a reason for me to walk to it here's the here's the reality i don't know a spot in minnesota unless somebody submits something new that has something new that i don't have to travel half an hour to 45 minutes outside of the city for there is nothing in minneapolis my neighborhood the campus uptown that i have not visited in the last five years and so the hunt for something new means i have to specifically say i am going to go to a completely different area and now try to find stuff that i haven't been to and if it's anywhere between minneapolis and the mall of america i've seen it i've spun it i've done it i've walked around it it's been five years of your game being out yeah unless i travel to milwaukee which i've done that i did it on your wedding i hit a bunch of stuff like you can show me places i've never been to but that is a trip i'm making yeah still it doesn't alter the fact that the 80 meter distance is not preventative it doesn't stop me from getting closer to the stop encourage me to get closer to the top right give me better rewards for getting closer to the stop let me and your player base make choices based off of their own safety and what they feel and reward people who play the game the way you want what angers me about a lot of companies and a lot of gaming companies do this is they hard focus on how they absolutely feel the games should be played and won't budge off of it even if it's been 15 20 years like no well i mean that's the way it is yes that is that is probably a roadblock or obstacle that game designers you have to be able to self-identify of like yes that's how you want the game to be played but you actually have to look at how people are actually playing the game and adapt i bet i will agree with you well i think the big takeaway from the meeting is like number one if you're going to make choices if you're going to make choices you have to be more transparent so people don't the the lack of transparency is why people speculate oh this is only about money or oh like niantic only wants a dollar with transparency though is then you give people a reason like to self-justify to why they're leaving if you leave it ambiguous and they can say i'm gonna stay because i think i'm angry about this but since i'm not sure that's what i'm angry about i'll stay but if they specifically like give you a reason and you're like oh that is the reason why i'm angry then i'm out and they go but the the other thing that i felt like this meeting was was you you have you haven't even looked your game was the same not the same but a lot of things in pogo for the last five years were decisions made on like the first year of the game like adventure sync adventure sync like and i i did say this during this was part two of what i said i only spoke for like i mean it was an hour meeting i only spoke for like two minutes because the third takeaway i had from the niantic meeting is people say a lot in a zoom call and they they say very little yeah they talk a lot i use a lot of words to say very little yes and it's like wow you just wasted 10 minutes of this meeting and you could have said one sentence ah so the second thing i said is i feel like i'm a hardcore player in pokemon go i have only hit the 50 in the last five years maybe a dozen times how many weeks in a year 52 um it's every week so 12 out of you know 200 weeks you are doing wrong or what am i doing that's so extraordinary you walk a lot i've started walking you i've been doing my daily constitutionals so i'm i'm getting closer to hitting those parts but yeah you walk a lot i see it i would say that i probably hit like 35 a week so i get the 25 reward which is who no one cares no one cares about the egg with cranidos in it and there's nothing in that game that's driving me to walk to get the 50 ever and when i did hit the 50 it just reminds me of how much of a disappointment it is to get it like again if you want your game like they've said this again and you know people are mad about like go fest of like one of the tasks was you know walk one kilometer their game is about walking i'm sorry that they've said it we've we've said it that's what it is if you want to play on the couch and not ever leave your house you can but their game is about walking and they've made it pretty clear over the last five years that look that's what you're signing up for i mean i i i do think that it is unfair to say that some of the people who are complaining about the walking requirements are just wanting to sit on the couch sure there's a number of people who cannot complete that task they just can't for mobility reasons for a ton of reasons so let's be real some of the people who are upset is legitimate this is an impossible task for me and you made it a vital part of this it wasn't optional i get why they're mad it's easy to say oh they just want to sit on the couch there's a whole section of people who want to play this game that cannot do those things they need to remember that that it's a game about walking it's also a pokemon game and there's a lot of people that can't necessarily do those walking things easy and that does need to be on their radar and a lot of those people started playing because of the covid changes correct totally understand was that oh yeah we were talking about the so the the i think the word somebody else used in the meeting was the game needs to be more additive to i agree uh versus like what they did was like remove features pretty much for everyone um so that whoever said that the game needs to be more additive million percent agree with you also i said a lot of words and i really said nothing but really i could have just said hey make your game more additive there we go we're here well i mean it's it's helpful to give concrete ideas of what you think that should be right like it's one thing to say hey make it more additive but be able to say like hey when i mean additive i want rewards to happen at certain things that reward me for these behaviors it's good to be clear or understand one of the key rules of customer service of once you start giving something away you can't take it back and also i i do want to i like i'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus but there were people in that meeting other content creators and whatnot making like saying things about their communities and what they do that i just disagree with like the whole pokestop thing of like no one cares about pokestops just make it 80 no one's going to poke stops because they want to see a horse statue i fundamentally i just disagree with that i mean i i i me as an individual i enjoy looking at the poke stops especially like when i'm sending gifts out to people and i see like the pokestops that they're sending me and the ones that i'm sending out to them and i'm like oh i don't remember passing that like when i went to the art park with you guys and before i met you guys that's how i explore i was like oh i i'm we're walking to the spaceship that's cool okay what's this what's this over here okay we're walking to the gnome under the tree like that is how i explored that park and it was a great way to explore that park um so i guess like that that leads into like i can kind of see why companies in general don't listen to their fan bases even though their fan bases are vocal because literally in this meeting some people just were like no one does this and i'm sitting here being like no people do do this like don't listen unmute my mic don't listen to that guy it is always a balancing act of what what feedback is is good and what feedback is bad and it is always hard to determine what percentage that person represents but generally if more than one person agrees with it there is a larger segment of your customer base that also feels that way and should be considered and when you have conflicting information then yeah you need to make a decision about how you think the game should be played but overall like one of the things is i don't think ever anybody disagreed with like the extended stop distance was good for everybody and yeah real mad when it went away like that's a clear message how you solve for x can be open for interpretation but yeah there's a ton of people who can't afford to travel have visited everything in their house a new pokestop is not you know going to see pokestops that they've seen a thousand times is not a draw for them to to go into that area again totally and there are people who have one pokestop in their town and they've always had one pokestop in their town so yeah i get it for that person in that town with one pokestop that pokestop probably not a drawdown thank you yeah really very well aware of what it is yeah they've probably been doing a lot i probably put it there uh so i i mean niantic apologized to us they they said like we made the decision to go back we learned that it was the wrong decision and we spent however long they spent like what three weeks talking about what was the right decision which i don't know like i mean in retrospect the right decision is like we'll just reverse it but i'm sure they were talking about like do we make it 60 do we make it 70 do we do only gyms do we only do stops do we do a hundred i'm sure that was all talked about and it probably just as easy as it was to say well it worked for four years let's go back to it it was probably easy to say we'll just go back to 80. yes well but also you know at least give niantic some acknowledgement and gratitude that they are willing to reflect on the question and make changes even if we don't like the first decision even if we don't like the change that they make at least they're willing to do so look i just went back to destiny 2 and some like thanks for telling me i heard that i heard that and you didn't invite me i heard that so literally these are dumb decisions but i they were really little things but my favorite class was the gunslinger class in destiny and in destiny 1 your your golden gun lasted like eight seconds and your trip mines stuck to enemies and to other players so in like crucible that was really good and in destiny 2 they were like trip mines no longer stick golden gun no longer lasts eight seconds you got like 2.5 seconds good luck you better have a good aim and those two changes were enough to be like i am no longer having fun with destiny yeah there were obviously other reasons and for a lot of pokemon go players it's just not this it's just not the radius it's the radius plus this and plus this and plus this and just i went back to destiny 2 this week after my wife was like please i want to try destiny again and five years later my golden gun is normal they they went back it took them five years they did they fixed the trip mine trip mine now sticks to enemies again so like if anything hey diantic only took three weeks bungie took five years to make these changes so i have had plenty of meetings with niantic they always and the people that i talk to i always leave those meetings optimistic like i don't know if it's the pokemon company i don't know if it's google i don't know if it's nintendo i don't know if it's like one specific boss that works at niantic but the people i talk to they they love the game so much they're so optimistic about it they're so excited with these changes that are rolling out they want to get our feedback of what we think about things that they are working on and i don't have any like super big secrets like i found out like even in the meeting with niantic about the change like they when i left that meeting they didn't say they were gonna they said they were gonna change it but they didn't give us a date they were like we regret the we regret the 40 we're going to change it we don't know what we're going to change it to we don't know when and then lo and behold like two days later they changed it um and there's another change on september 1st so i don't know what that is um but hopefully it's something good all in all i'm going to tell you as an employee of another company i can definitely muster up excitement when i'm talking about my own company that i don't really feel yep but i love pokemon go i want pokemon go to be the best game there is i hope that whatever they say on september 1st is like hey we're fixing avengers sync we want to make it more fun like i i just hope that this 40 and 80 debate or problem or issue or mistake whatever you want to classify it i i kind of am glad that it happened because i think everyone whether it's a company or just a person they like need a sometimes they need something tragic to be like we should really reflect on this or the things that we the things that we just took for granted for four years we should actually look at them and say like hey the world is different the game is different our players are different and we should change them one would tragic maybe not the best word a global pandemic would have brought about these decisions and it did what's what the sign of a very mid-sized company is you don't have a lot of voices in those meetings and i think that shows in a lot of their decisions is you're i think niantic still has a we're a tiny company trying to do good and hasn't wrestled with the fact that you're a very large company that a lot of people are watching now you may not have a lot of employees but you're playing with the big boys and you are no longer able to be like oops we're just little people we didn't think about it like you have to get on board with what millions of other companies that do vital services or that a lot of people are into is you really have to be in touch with your customer base you have to get better communication you have to understand that you can't see yourself as this little underdog anymore when you're making 2.5 million dollars a month a lot of money yeah i i i i agree when pokemon go is good it's really good i i agree with that for as much as the game frustrates me when we're having fun i love it and that or when i'm just walking through my neighborhood and suddenly i can't get to a gym like nah i'm pretty mad at you right now yeah it's i mean and it's i think it's it's easier to be frustrated with it because it's on your phone and you're in the real world and you can just swipe it close and move on versus sitting on your couch or in front of your hand if your gps was better and didn't shoot me all over the city giving me extra distance and maybe get there would be help uh yeah i don't have anything else i mean like uh i i thought niantic was pretty transparent i think the the when they told us their thought process i was like this makes sense even though i don't agree with you but at least at least your company is your company is doing something um they're trying yes but uh yeah we'll see what the september first stuff is i hope i i hope it's more i i hope it's exciting i hope it's like hey we're fixing xyz we're putting they're bringing that pokemon z finally yes niantic is the lead developer pokemon z for the nintendo switch that's what they've been working on for five years all right we'll take a break we're going to talk about pokemon masters on the uh when we get back and then question the week pokemon in the week so we will be all right back oh they're here what is happening did you guys see that wait a minute did you see that machine did you guys see that was that just me that was so scary and we are back from our break all right this is off pokemon.com uh pokemon masters ex two year anniversary event has new sync pairs and more so we were talking two weeks ago about what could they possibly do that would be better than leon and the answer was nothing nah these are good they're great they're very good but literally none of these blow leon out of the water leon leon in that sigma suit is the greatest thing that they have put into that game these are good but they do not reach that bar i think the internet would disagree with you on lily they are yes yeah i am not interested in lilly let's be clear i have made that very clear on this program i am not lily and i can go shopping for clothing and i support her in your choices but i am i am down to hang out a lot with leon sigma suit all right so we have uh misty and psyduck lily and luna n and reshram and steven and rayquaza are all arriving with the opportunity to collect gems and scout tickets it is party time on paseo as pokemon masters ex celebrates its two-year anniversary to mark this auspicious occasion there's a wide variety of special events new sink pairs log in bonuses and the return of classic story events in addition to all the fun festivals the games level cap this is the worst part about the whole announcement the game's level cap will increase to level 140 check out the excitement that's in store for the anniversary event okay so first we have the hearts united event which the festival kicks off with the new hearts united event story which runs from august 27th through september 29th leer is putting on a special battle event with lily and and steven as host uh the question is which of the opponents of these three trainers will be selected to battle by completing the mission you can earn up to 1 300 gems you will face extreme competition in the unity gala challenge in which you will take on lear rachel and sawyer with your sink pairs keep checking to the hearts united event new areas will appear as the celebration goes on here's a hint you will need fighting type sink pairs for battle flying uh okay so then they did the misty in a swimsuit finally it's been two years we get swimsuit misty still waiting for swimsuit ramos but one day hey i am i have hope so misty and psyduck long time pokemon fans will be excited with the arrival of the sink pair from august 27 through october 15th you can enjoy the event start starring the cerulean city gym leader and the lovable psyduck completing this event will let you team up with psyduck and you can raise this thing so this is totally this is free you don't have to pull her you just have to i didn't realize that she wasn't a pull you just need to complete the story and then keep completing the story to get enough tickets to raise her level but yeah she's pretty much completely free she's uh also hopping zamasu are free if you're new to the game so new sync pairs uh a trio news sim card is making their debut from august 27 through september 29th three pokemon trainers in these sink pairs are returning characters sporting cool anniversary outfits each one is paired with a new legendary partner um so you have lilly anniversary 2021 with lunala and anniversary 2021 with resharam and steven anniversary 2021 with rayquaza for what it's worth the rayquaza is shiny yeah shiny raymond quasar is here with his pal stephen uh want to add even more sync pairs to your squad from september 29th uh until september 29th so literally a whole month you can log into pokemon masters ex for 10 days to receive 10 pair scout tickets each day these tickets will let you uh be used in the special 10 pair scout which can be found in the ticket scout within the shop as you might expect 10 pair scout tickets will allow you to scout 10 sink pairs which means you can team up with a hundred sink pairs totally for free this was the big thing they showed during the pokemon presents um yeah and it is free there is no cash it is free uh i think it's bold of them with as many repeats as they give to so you'll be able to team up with a hundred sink pairs you will probably cheat up with 50 because you get a lot of repeats it's too to be fair not trying to defend but if you're a new player to the game you kind of want those duplicates to make sure they're five out of five oh yeah but but i think it's both of them to say you can team up with a hundred sig pairs nah doc you're not it's gonna be like 50 ramos like that's like ramos and 20 bryson men and then you'll get one five stars so good luck uh yeah i mean you have a seven percent chance of every ten pole to get a five star you get to do it ten times i did see a bunch of people in our discord and our slack say like this is this was what got them to download the game it's super smart marketing it's a very good deal uh it's it's you you're getting your 100 sync pairs for free uh you're logging into the game 10 times to get that for free you're getting your gems for logging in uh they had a 3 000 bonus for the two year anniversary i do you still you still get the 3 000 bonus to celebrate like pokemon presents or whatever so you show you so if you're walking in i believe you're getting like 6 000 gems for free plus the 100 gems every day to celebrate plus the 1300 gems for doing the misty or the whatever plus there's other events that will give you gems so again if you're a new player it's really hard to be bitter i'm sure the bitterness will come when you pull nothing good yeah but yes it will uh they're they're really rewarding both new players and returning players which is awesome i i feel like a lot of games they always like focus on new players and the returning players are like what am i like i've been playing your game like give me something too i'm playing your game but i think they're doing a really good job at both they are returning some story events here so from september 2nd through the 16th uh you have the girl in black and white featuring hilda and ted pig from september 4th through the 16th you have material mining which features material evolutions for evolving pokemon from september 6 through september 16th you have lilly clefairy gladion silvally lusimin and feramosa are coming to the family ties event from september 8th through the 16th you have the uh volkner and lux ray from september 10th through 16th you have uh lis lisia how do you say her name lycia i think it's lisa with altaria which i believe she's steven stone's sister she is wallace's niece oh uh and then you have from september 2nd through the 16th you have the ideal formula which features n and zekrom the thing they don't say here is that these the lilly the stevenstone and the n banners are what do they call them they're called like the they're so the normal banner is a seven percent chance of pulling a five star and usually the the trainer featured in that banner is like a two percent so you have a one in 50 chance of pulling nor detecting percentage-wise and then there's called a fair scout banner yeah which is a which is a instead of a 7 chance of getting a 5 star you have a 10 chance of getting a 5 star and then usually in that banner the same thing it's a two percent chance of getting what you want these are like they are master fair scouts master fair scout so it's a 12 chance of getting a five star but lily steven and n are only a one percent chance which this is not the first time they did it they did this with maxie and archie i believe and one one other they did it with i think but max and archie were the big like one percent these outfits are really great though but they're just outfits steven stones is great lily's is very good ends is fine but it's just the outfit there's no gameplay affecting well so well the pokemon are the game pokemon so judging by how they are what they look to be lily is actually probably the least powerful one of the group but she's probably the best ghost but it's probably the best ghost but there's i mean phoebe's the best ghost like that tank and what phoebe does this lily's not gonna hold a candle that uh yeah but your best ghost type attacker is morty yeah and i'm pretty sure lily's luna is gonna blow morty out of the water probably but you don't really need ghost type attackers uh from what i've seen uh stephen and rayquaza is almost as op as sycamore and xerneas is or well even stephen and metagross i think is still one of the best units you can have like metagross is great from what i understand from looking into it like you want you want stephen stone you want and and then lily is probably gonna be very good but if you have to make a choice uh you're gonna go for steven or n i was hoping the anniversary paid stuff would be better um it is like the best that it can be um but it's well it's the best they're going to do i don't think it's the best it can be no it could definitely be better it is the best they're going to do it is the same deal as the one year anniversary it is like 80 for 1400 gems which is like the best they've ever done but they could do better usually the thing if you do want to give masters money your your best bang for your buck is honestly the one dollar for 300 gems because that will give you because normally it's one dollar for a hundred gems and then sometimes they do like one dollar for 150 gems but the one dollar for 300 gems you get three uh daily scouts with that that's probably like if you just want to give them a couple bucks and you just want a couple daily scouts especially with like a 12 chance of five star um i think you can buy that like three times so three dollars will get you like nine days of daily scout polls and it's not terribly expensive it's probably more value than anything you're gonna get in an incubator and pogo but i don't i don't know the the i i was going like what could be possibly better than leon and these three are pretty good they're good they're not better but they're good that's a better perspective you know if pokemon masters needed anything to save their game anniversary anniversary all of japan would go all of japan would be in debt i mean for whatever reason barney is like number one in japan they did summer soup marnie and summer soup yeah that's true is is an amazing pair like grim style is so good in the game but when you put that word anniversary in front of it it's all over i mean people like summer as much as like anniversaries yeah yeah yeah what they needed was and surprise mirror bee and there be nobody would be able to resist look if niantic can listen to us dna give me mirror give me the mirror be mere being ludacola not in the game yet save it up for the two and a half year anniversary you know you look at these three sing pairs and you go what can top this what are they gonna do for the three year anniversary i mean we'll have another generation up by then maybe no yeah we'll have they'll bring forward the legends of arceus brought through time we need the uh we are getting chairman rose so swimsuit rose swimsuit rose so we never got beach giovanni which was in the anime we have not gotten beat giovanni yet that is that is a back pocket that is a back pocket hey somebody sent in an email about the like uh they work in a museum and and it was really really good uh remind me we'll do that next week because the show's pokemon masters oh i was thinking of uh arceus sorry the like the sinnoh region and the his region they they had some thoughts and like as being a historian they wanted to share their perspective it was a really good email um so remind me we'll cover that just remember listeners steve forgets about email i do forget about email and then you want my deep dive remind me the real details um i think it's a good look i think this is probably the best time you can try masters and you can probably walk away from it being like i like it or it's not for me yep because you get so many sync pairs there's a lot of events going on they're giving a bunch of free stamina um they brought back a lot of events that give you good free sink pairs so like you can get caught up pretty easy um i am not thrilled with the 140 level cap but whatever yeah and honestly like i'm most of my sync pairs were 120 125 because i didn't even get to the point where when they moved from 125 to 130 i was like i'm not doing this right now and the game is played a little bit it's fine i will say if you're a new player there's there's like it says something like hard or super hard or ultra hard like you don't have to do that ultra hard content to enjoy the game it seems like you do because it's like a stepladder but like the ultra hard content is designed for the actual hardcore people so like don't feel bad if you're not doing it like i i can't even remember the last time i did an ultra hard and i was like boy this felt worth it like it is it it it does have a nice reward most of the time but it it's not unnecessary don't feel like oh i'm bad at this game because i can't do like that is that content is designed for people who live and breathe this game and if you're just logging in every day and spending your stamina and just pulling that content's not for you don't don't feel bad if you can't do it yeah just do something else most sync pairs on their sync grid are great at three out of five like you can get through the content you don't need and a lot of them more than you don't need more than three for a lot of them to get everything you need out of their sync grid so like it is really truly one of the games where like this is the hardcore content and it is for hardcore like the hop event is the first time i've ever done the ultra hard ever it was like yeah i'll try it yeah and even even the synchronous stuff almost all that story stuff you do don't even have to touch it nope yep just power up the couple that you really like and uh yeah i think it's fun and then at a certain point you'll be like please let me auto battle yes yes you will uh yeah i think i think pokemon masters ex is in a real real good place right now uh surprisingly compared to other of their mobile games goodbye rumble rush goodbye pokemon duel [Laughter] rest in peace uh question of the week question of the week yeah go ahead and ask that question pull from submissions found on the youtube and slack [Music] this is hmm wow prepare for this it must be a deep question i'm just trying to see what i'm in the mood to answer oh i see how you are uh i like brandon's do you prefer a pokemon game that is set in the past period like johto or legends modern era or future period personally i would like to see a a hyper futuristic take on pokemon i want them all i would play all of them i'm the same as greg yeah yeah like yes yes to past yes to future yes to modern like i want to see pokemon on other planets i want to poke pokemon mars visit yep i want i want space pikachu in a in a helmet and shoots lightning out of a laser gun yes these are the things that i want i want these i opened up a bunch of digimon cards and one of the gimmicks in digimon at one point was fusions they like took they'll take like two digimons and they fused together and oh fresh ram kirim zekrom they exist i get it they're here but that has to be a gimmick one day of like charizard and mewtwo two of the most popular pokemon like fuse those together i want to see that they did that in the anime with the like it was like a flashback or whatever or like an illusion but like the venus toys where they took the penis so whatever if it's modern past or future i mean that's that's future stuff right that's future give me the fusions i want i want that gimmick that's some cyberpunk wild fusion play with the genes you got your you got your you got your entire race of people that have fused with venusaur dna and so they're plant people and they run around uh there's the alternative timeline where every bad guy wins what they need to win and then giovanni transfers them into the place right and then like wait a minute i don't think they won what they needed to win i think which was true happiness because they're chasing out of their timeline like right before their bitter defeat oh okay more like it yeah and at one point spoilers for the end of ultrasound ultra mood at one point coleris like z zaps in and then grabs gatsas and then zaps out right that's how that happens i kind of remember that yes so i need the futuristic pokemon game where chorus is somewhere there i feel like chorus is the one that's involved in that oh absolutely okay our question from youtube is from void of sin i like this one a lot although we kind of answered it on the patreon bonus podcast but i wasn't i wasn't there that you guys weren't there they say why do you think the graphics complaint started i grew up with pokemon and not once did i ever think about the games looking graphical masterpieces no or cared that they did i don't think the 3ds games look good i find it bizarre when people say sword and shield look worse than sun and moon i also find that bizarre um why do people care about uh appearance why do why do appearance matter so much to people nowadays uh i blame steve same okay easy answer uh no the easy answer is like this is all of video games though it doesn't matter what if it's pokemon or halo or call of duty like the graphic like i this is what i said here here's a spoiler for the patreon thing i remember being in high school being on the nintendo forums when nintendo had their own official for like the official nintendo forums and most threads on that forums were non-stop people comparing nintendo games to the xbox 360. because the xbox 360 was coming out and the king kong game was like the graphical powerhouse that was showing it was just day in and day out of nintendo fans saying their graphics don't matter because we got the better games and the xbox looks better but their games aren't like this conversation has existed before the nintendo forums and well after the nintendo forums i mean i will say that it existed back when the hardware was garb like the intellivision versus atari conversations that we had back in the day of the same conversation colecovision which i had i love clicovision um so there's a couple of things we i don't think we can get past the sort of gatekeepy tribal aspect of it right like it starts with the i am an xbox person and therefore i'm going to pick the things that i like and argue that that's better and you're going to get these arguments of this is better x is better because this is the brand they identify with and so like a huge chunk of it is gatekeepy uh intertribal garbage fine i think what we've also run into is we have crossed the technology barrier where a lot of things that we didn't think were possible are now very much possible and we can do them in our hand so it's hard to [Music] translate easily for a lot of people who grew up in a high technology society who didn't who aren't necessarily fully aware of how bad it was to sort of grasp like why can't everything be at x quality because my phone can do it and it's tiny it's in my hand and it's it's it's harder to see because we've made so many advancements how how different hardware powers and different priorities come into play it's a very nuanced conversation that doesn't work on the internet period like so so that argument that's what i call the all the factors argument it's where if you look if you're only looking skin deep you can say well if this game could do it then that game can do it but you're not looking at all the factors yeah right that there's maybe a lot of data weight to the way that the gameplay is designed that takes away from the space available to hold graphic capabilities or music or users or so there are trade-offs i also would want to say like in in line with what greg was saying about tribal there's another thing that we since we don't participate in this and we so we tend to kind of ignore it is it kind of goes in line with when i was younger and i wouldn't listen to like mariah carey or madonna because that's the music everybody else is into and i could only listen to bands that you had never heard because that makes me that makes me a better person right it's and it's like the inverse of that all the all the cool people are crapping on the graphics even though when i watched that that thing i never even thought of the graphics but oh wait wait a minute this cool dude that i look up to on the internet is now saying how terrible those graphics are i'm going to latch on to that argument so i can be like the cool dude because that's obviously the cool dudes arguing whether i actually care about the graphics or not or ever cared before yes that is an argument that i like right for me and i have you know what go through the history of this podcast you can get quotes from me saying a hundred times a thousand times i used to play a game where it was one square shooting a tiny square at another square and my imagination filled in the details i am happy with whatever you give me now it's also hard to get out of negative opinions get more attention than positive opinions yes it's very easy to find a lot of negative opinions on the internet and they draw your attention they make you feel emotions more than positive takes do so it is our natural inclination to find the things that are negative and say hey these are the things that because being negative gets me attention like there's a whole slew of reasons why this conversation comes up um but and it's really people there are some people that genuinely care about graphics though right like there are yeah like to be fair like some people they want a good looking game because that's what they want and that's totally fair and and it is hard to decide divine out what they mean by good looking like i had this conversation after three hours like what do you consider good looking like what exactly do you want it to be and and it the conversation gets very muddy because people don't define their terms and so it's very hard to not have two separate conversations because you're not being specific like you're saying i want graphics to be better but you're not defining what you consider what graphite means are you angry about the watercolor art style or are you angry because the edges aren't smooth right like that's an important thing to divine out of the conversation and i had to have that conversation with a lot of people like what exactly don't you like what do you want to be better because that helps shape whether i agree or disagree with you but it's really easy to say graphics are bad and in what way how hey i said why yeah i wasn't into that ground i wasn't in that water it's also not finished it's the textures it's the textures i mean you know and my argument to people back was like you know we mocked people for the tree argument for two years i'm not going to have a water argument i'm not going to fall into the same trap like the trees are and finish the waters unfinished like it's not an argument i'm having because they're not done oh well the trees were never done these trees will if we go back to the tree argument the game sword and shield ended up looking better of course except the trees uh the the other thing is like uh like people it is weird to me where people are like oh the sort the like sun and moon look better than sword and shield they're just out of their minds they just wanted to make those like like there were people that are are like well pokemon masters looks better than sword and shield and it's like yeah but also pokemon masters is like 3d pokemon and it's just the same pokemon models as sword and shield but like all the backgrounds and masters is like flatness static yeah they're like static backgrounds like you're not moving like you're not moving around in the pokemon center in masters you're just looking at everyone standing there um who are also not moving right it's it's like it's it's really weird i i i am worried that like x and y and sun and moon will start looking very very bad um like how nintendo 64 games don't hold up anymore uh but that doesn't that doesn't really happen with like red and blue or like black and white because they're pixel in a way so they they they look exactly how they look i don't know i don't think pixel art like i don't think super nintendo games or nes games age as poorly as nintendo 64 games i i i would disagree they look real bad yeah they do you ever tried ice climbers like take your nostalgia glasses off no it's valuable starter valley looks incredible and it's it's designed to look like a super nintendo game it's designed to look that way but it's not like linked to the past it takes incredible looking it takes the influence of it and puts it in that retro art style but it is not using just 16 bits it is not using just eight bits like you can say and this is the argument i've been having it was done in a retro art style and they did that to appeal to that style but that is not a 16-bit game not by half like you are talking about two different two different aspects 8-bit games look terrible they couldn't do better than 8-bit games i think the original super mario brothers and the original legend of zelda on the nes i think they i think they look good yeah but they were pushing the limits of those systems man they were they were but i think i think they're like they do not look i i am sure there are a handful of super nintendo games that look awful but i think like donkey kong country i think legend of zelda i think um yoshi's island like i feel like all those games hold up graphically i think wind waker holds up graphically i don't think gale of darkness or coliseum hold up graphically because they they their nintendo 64 games ported to the gamecube and then run over with a mud truck to like hide the or like to try to smooth things out they look pretty bad um i think stadium does look pretty bad now i think gold and i i don't even know how anyone can play golden eye on the nintendo 64 anymore like geez that looks awful but i think there are some i think there are games that capture a style i don't i'm sure if i'm not actually sure if it's style or graphics or what you want to call it but it ages very well and i think wind waker is the game that age has aged picked a very cartoony art style yes which was a good choice because it helped keep them within the limits of what graphics could do and that's my point that game holds up because they went with a very distinct art style that feels more timeless but that was a choice of making that world is it's the argument people have between world of warcraft and final fantasy both require the same level of graphic cards they look very different one is cartoony one is hyper realistic and you're drawn to one of the two styles but they both burn your cpo at just as much power and will stress your graphics card out it is a hard conversation to have because you have to define what you're talking about and i don't think like an eight the original zelda game with the shooty sword looks good by any modern standards no but you fill it in with your imagination yeah it looks like an old game like you i we all played i don't know if you ever played the game adventure game where the dragon looked like a duck like i have fun that sounds awesome but it is an awful game it is graphically terrible and when i look at i'm like yeah it's awful but i loved it as a kid like it's a very game play was so good the gameplay was great and you got chased by a giant dragon duck yeah i'm into the dragon okay here real simple question uh this is from cayden since apparently everything i was on the table since masculine of all pokemon got an evo which pokemon do you think either in legends or games of head would get one should i get one should get one uh which game which what pokemon do you think should get more love either in legends or games ahead oh i say so standler got an evolution basketball you got an evolution which give me a pokemon deliberate not jelly bird you know what i want you know what i want you guys to do evolution i'm gonna say miractis i already said miraculous i took it from you say something no you said dunspars i said miractus first because i knew that's what you were getting what'd you say well ice cube ice cube oh ice cube absolutely would be a cutie no evolution i really think i'm gonna die in this hill i want a cat i want a baby cow if it's female it evolves into miltank if it's male it evolves into tauros yeah baby cow and if you give it i was just gonna say if it's non-binary it it evolves into buffalo tennis uh pokemon of the week all right last week's pokemon i was talking about sinnoh bringing that up and the fact that they added a heck ton of new evolutions akin to the question we just had for pokemon that previously did not have evolutions uh and then i said uh the kind of the causes of those news evolutions that were introduced in those games uh some had to evolve while knowing a particular move some had to be exposed to a held item some had to evolve in a special location at least at that time [Music] and some had to be holding a razor slash item at night it was none of those and then there was one other way that you could evolve a pokemon which has been around since generation one um except it had to do this while holding something and then that's all you need that's all you need i gave all the information who's that pokemon it's chat yep shout out holding a leaf chad is in history it was in the art for legends oh yeah yeah yeah chad is yes chat is in there yeah uh it's dust claps dust clops is correct so everybody who guessed dust noir you don't understand how evolution works i mean to be fair i wrote down dusk noir to remind me of a piece of paper that i wanted the one before it dust sorry i didn't have this plastic claps it is the combination of the word dusk and clops cyclops it only has one eye uh very good competitively very good shiny too yeah man is shiny is so good in gen five and then once it gets to the gen six it's so bad how do they mess up colors how how indeed uh very good shuffle icon good shiny up to a point like we're just not gonna talk about it it

appears on the screen the written words make it appear as if it is trying to speak english this pokemon much like its colossian cousin meowstic can have both a different appearance and ability based on its presumed gender that's all that's it that's everything you need jeez i wasn't ready for that eyes are super short in and out bam bam all right speaking of in and out we're done thanks for
