tomorrow i have the day off and i'm very (0:40 - 0:44)
excited about it to eat all the bad (0:42 - 0:46)
foods and after this very recording i (0:44 - 0:48)
have to make my list of the things that (0:46 - 0:50)
i want to try (0:48 - 0:52)
so we don't waste time on things that (0:50 - 0:54)
are bad that would be a good tick tock (0:52 - 0:58)
right top 10 state fair things and then (0:54 - 1:01)
literally everybody else in minnesota (0:58 - 1:02)
does that also tic toc's a garbage (1:01 - 1:06)
platform and i don't know why you use it (1:02 - 1:06)
because i like garbage yes you eat (1:07 - 1:12)
garbage you ingest garbage both with (1:09 - 1:13)
your mouth (1:12 - 1:16)
and your eyes i make garbage (1:13 - 1:18)
and then you produce garbage (1:16 - 1:20)
for others to put into their eyes and (1:18 - 1:23)
ears it's just a bad cycle and i'm sad (1:20 - 1:25)
that i'm a part of it (1:23 - 1:27)
as will is also a part of it and i was (1:25 - 1:31)
going to say uh we actually need to (1:27 - 1:35)
re-characterize this podcast as it's not (1:31 - 1:36)
it's not (1:35 - 1:38)
steve gregon will it's the one who makes (1:36 - 1:41)
unfounded generalizations the one with (1:38 - 1:43)
unreasonable expectations or (1:41 - 1:45)
cheats at commander (1:43 - 1:47)
take your pick (1:45 - 1:49)
and i did not the one who's sane (1:47 - 1:52)
reasonable and correct (1:49 - 1:54)
i mean you cheated commander you were (1:52 - 1:56)
like i'm going to zap this and i'm going (1:54 - 1:58)
to zap that and i'm going to just jump (1:56 - 1:59)
this card here and then zap this out and (1:58 - 2:01)
then i'm going to dump this over here (1:59 - 2:04)
cheater i didn't i it was oh no there (2:01 - 2:06)
was all i was trying to do i had to make (2:04 - 2:09)
dinosaurs gathering (2:06 - 2:09)
and nobody wanted to let me make (2:09 - 2:14)
dinosaur cats nobody wanted me to let (2:11 - 2:16)
pull artifacts out of out of nowhere and (2:14 - 2:18)
put them on the battlefield i wasn't in (2:16 - 2:21)
that game and nobody wanted me to do (2:18 - 2:23)
oh to bring out angels including my deck (2:21 - 2:26)
because i couldn't pull it (2:23 - 2:28)
but no no steve he's (2:26 - 2:31)
literally greg gets to this one point in (2:28 - 2:34)
the game and he literally takes like a a (2:31 - 2:38)
dry erase board card draws a heart on it (2:34 - 2:40)
and says okay i can't be killed now (2:38 - 2:43)
well how is that not cheating it's (2:40 - 2:45)
because it was sierra's ultimate which (2:43 - 2:47)
you had warned everybody about and (2:45 - 2:49)
nobody did anything about it so i was (2:47 - 2:52)
like fine i'll take it (2:49 - 2:53)
i only have two other ways of doing that (2:52 - 2:56)
in that deck anyways (2:53 - 2:58)
only two other ways (2:56 - 3:00)
[Laughter] (2:58 - 3:02)
i feel like we all have i (3:00 - 3:04)
feel like we all have that friend that (3:02 - 3:06)
always cheats in every like tabletop (3:04 - 3:08)
slash board game (3:06 - 3:10)
the actually the but i mean yeah we're (3:08 - 3:12)
all friends with the same guy yeah (3:10 - 3:14)
the best play i made in that entire game (3:12 - 3:16)
was convincing everybody to go after (3:14 - 3:19)
vince (3:16 - 3:22)
cause vince vince is 99 (3:19 - 3:24)
the problem at the table vince was not (3:22 - 3:26)
necessarily the problem at the time (3:24 - 3:27)
i knew it (3:26 - 3:30)
i was a bigger pro at the table but (3:27 - 3:33)
y'all (3:30 - 3:33)
you are feel free to not learn magic we (3:34 - 3:39)
don't need you (3:37 - 3:41)
vince and i have already planned out the (3:39 - 3:44)
cat commander deck both cute cats you (3:41 - 3:47)
and you could be making cat dinosaurs (3:44 - 3:48)
yeah okay (3:47 - 3:52)
i'm back in i'm back into magic we have (3:48 - 3:56)
we have both types sexy and cute cats (3:52 - 3:58)
for a deck for you we've been working on (3:56 - 4:00)
this for months yeah but what about the (3:58 - 4:03)
pokemon trading card game it's garbage (4:00 - 4:04)
and the client is garbage and it's (4:03 - 4:06)
boring (4:04 - 4:08)
i can't play rosalia so i'm out what (4:06 - 4:10)
about (4:08 - 4:13)
the digimon card game it's also bad but (4:10 - 4:14)
did you see me opening those cards they (4:13 - 4:16)
looked so good when i was there you're (4:14 - 4:18)
like we're gonna do it later we well we (4:16 - 4:20)
did it we opened digimon cars and (4:18 - 4:22)
they're great there (4:20 - 4:24)
so no i didn't see it (4:22 - 4:27)
oh my goodness (4:24 - 4:29)
i know a store that has digimon so i can (4:27 - 4:31)
actually no it's like interaction i was (4:29 - 4:34)
playing magic with will and not cheating (4:31 - 4:36)
we got uh (4:34 - 4:37)
oh okay (4:36 - 4:38)
before we get to news it's a good (4:37 - 4:39)
transition (4:38 - 4:41)
uh (4:39 - 4:43)
so in card games sometimes you have to (4:41 - 4:46)
roll dice right yes correct (4:43 - 4:48)
and will will knows this really well (4:46 - 4:53)
um when we played the tcg competitively (4:48 - 4:57)
i would always import like japanese (4:53 - 4:59)
card sleeves (4:57 - 5:01)
and then i imported japanese dice and my (4:59 - 5:03)
friend andrew sent me some japanese (5:01 - 5:05)
pokemon dice so when you played pokemon (5:03 - 5:07)
competitively (5:05 - 5:09)
there was no you didn't ever have to (5:07 - 5:11)
roll a die but you could roll a die (5:09 - 5:12)
instead of flipping a coin (5:11 - 5:14)
and no one wanted to flip a coin because (5:12 - 5:16)
it was like no one knows (5:14 - 5:17)
in reality no one actually knows how to (5:16 - 5:19)
flip a coin you'd be like sitting across (5:17 - 5:20)
from the table and they'd be like (5:19 - 5:22)
struggling to put it on their thumb and (5:20 - 5:24)
then it would be like this really like (5:22 - 5:26)
uh weak flop (5:24 - 5:29)
and it would be really easy to weigh or (5:26 - 5:31)
to what was that called like way a coin (5:29 - 5:33)
yes like you should like shave off hat (5:31 - 5:35)
like half of it so it like more likely (5:33 - 5:37)
it lands on heads it's easy so cheat it (5:35 - 5:38)
dice (5:37 - 5:41)
wow so well well here's the (5:38 - 5:43)
very specific rules about dice and (5:41 - 5:45)
pokemon yes so instead of like flipping (5:43 - 5:46)
a coin for heads or tails you roll a (5:45 - 5:49)
dice if it's if it's even it's heads if (5:46 - 5:51)
it's odds the tail is pretty easy right (5:49 - 5:55)
so i my friend andrew sent me these (5:51 - 5:57)
po a pokemon dice that you got at the (5:55 - 6:01)
pokemon center and one was a pokeball (5:57 - 6:02)
and then one was pikachu so it was like (6:01 - 6:04)
six different pikachu expressions and (6:02 - 6:06)
then one was just like it was just like (6:04 - 6:09)
a pokeball and then five numbers (6:06 - 6:11)
and i would bring those to tournaments (6:09 - 6:14)
now the rule for play pokemon is your (6:11 - 6:15)
die (6:14 - 6:17)
you can use any dice you want but they (6:15 - 6:19)
had to be translucent you had to be able (6:17 - 6:21)
to see through them which obviously (6:19 - 6:23)
these pokemon center dice are and they (6:21 - 6:25)
had to have rounded edges you couldn't (6:23 - 6:26)
have (6:25 - 6:29)
um hard at straight edges (6:26 - 6:31)
and so i would bring these little two (6:29 - 6:35)
pokemon die to roll at my matches (6:31 - 6:36)
because they're you know they have (6:35 - 6:37)
pikachu on them why would you not bring (6:36 - 6:40)
them they're very cute not like barely (6:37 - 6:42)
anyone had them they were pokemon center (6:40 - 6:43)
official in japan (6:42 - 6:47)
and this is what every single (6:43 - 6:49)
tournament i went to and i went to them (6:47 - 6:50)
for three years (6:49 - 6:53)
the opponent would never (6:50 - 6:54)
care (6:53 - 6:57)
that i had these die (6:54 - 6:58)
dice (6:57 - 7:00)
until i rolled (6:58 - 7:04)
a heads that gave me the advantage and (7:00 - 7:05)
the win oh yeah (7:04 - 7:07)
so like we start off the match he'd be (7:05 - 7:09)
like heads or tails to start the match (7:07 - 7:11)
i'd be like tails i roll heads they'd be (7:09 - 7:13)
like all right i'm going first (7:11 - 7:14)
because you know they got it right and (7:13 - 7:17)
then i'd be like all right i'm using (7:14 - 7:19)
double slap roll the dice uh two tails (7:17 - 7:22)
that's zero damage your turn but as soon (7:19 - 7:25)
as i rolled away to like solidify that (7:22 - 7:27)
i'm probably going to win the game hand (7:25 - 7:30)
would go up and they would be like judge (7:27 - 7:32)
and they would call a judge over because (7:30 - 7:35)
they're strat oh gosh i'm getting so mad (7:32 - 7:38)
of this the strat was i was using (7:35 - 7:41)
custom die and that was against the (7:38 - 7:44)
rules and they didn't care but now that (7:41 - 7:47)
i'm winning they cared and i wish i was (7:44 - 7:50)
exaggerating but this was every single (7:47 - 7:52)
tournament and every tournament the (7:50 - 7:53)
judge would come over and they'd be like (7:52 - 7:55)
what's the problem and they would be (7:53 - 7:57)
like he's uh he's using custom dice (7:55 - 7:59)
probably got it off etsy or something (7:57 - 8:01)
and the guy the judges would thank (7:59 - 8:02)
goodness this was like the one thing the (8:01 - 8:04)
judges ever did right they would be like (8:02 - 8:06)
these are official pokemon center die (8:04 - 8:07)
they're they're tournament legal and (8:06 - 8:09)
they (8:07 - 8:11)
look very mad that (8:09 - 8:12)
don't (8:11 - 8:14)
what i'm saying is we're all playing (8:12 - 8:15)
magic the gathering and no longer (8:14 - 8:17)
pokemon i'm not gonna play this (8:15 - 8:18)
nightmare game (8:17 - 8:21)
i'm excited for you to join us on our (8:18 - 8:23)
commander nights i don't know it sounds (8:21 - 8:25)
like magic has some problems you're (8:23 - 8:29)
drawing hearts on cards and (8:25 - 8:30)
commander does away with a lot of the (8:29 - 8:32)
problems (8:30 - 8:34)
that's true this is true because cards (8:32 - 8:36)
don't go out of favor and you only have (8:34 - 8:39)
one copy of each (8:36 - 8:39)
it's super fun and they banned hull (8:39 - 8:45)
breacher before i could remove yeah (8:41 - 8:48)
they did well that was a bad card (8:45 - 8:49)
all right (8:48 - 8:52)

when they come out with the revised one (12:22 - 12:26)
yeah aren't they getting a new pokemon (12:24 - 12:27)
tcg (12:26 - 12:30)
thingy with the stuff yeah well (12:27 - 12:32)
well i wish there was a lot to talk (12:30 - 12:35)
about here but there's not (12:32 - 12:37)
i mean i'm just been watching (12:35 - 12:40)
my diamond and pearl anime on my ipad (12:37 - 12:41)
like (12:40 - 12:44)
an adult (12:41 - 12:44)
so (12:46 - 12:49)
this was tweeted by a bunch of accounts (12:47 - 12:51)
but this is literally all the news we (12:49 - 12:53)
have (12:51 - 12:54)
it's a tweet (12:53 - 12:56)
but there's a retailer (12:54 - 12:58)
i think it was a (12:56 - 13:00)
spanish retailer there was a retailer (12:58 - 13:02)
listing for (13:00 - 13:03)
the new (13:02 - 13:04)
pokemon trading card game coming out (13:03 - 13:08)
which is called fusion strike (13:04 - 13:09)
and (13:08 - 13:11)
when they sh when they have like the (13:09 - 13:12)
little f (13:11 - 13:14)
uh information path pamphlet about (13:12 - 13:16)
fusion strike (13:14 - 13:19)
it says that there is (13:16 - 13:23)
um a new app pokemon tcg live due to (13:19 - 13:25)
come soon and that's (13:23 - 13:27)
that's all that's all we know (13:25 - 13:30)
we don't know if that's (13:27 - 13:30)
it it seems very unlikely that's like a (13:31 - 13:35)
typo (13:34 - 13:37)
because they're like right new app (13:35 - 13:40)
here's the new app's name pokemon tcg (13:37 - 13:41)
live it's not like (13:40 - 13:44)
they just called pokemon trading card (13:41 - 13:48)
game online tcg live which those are not (13:44 - 13:52)
that similar but they say new app and (13:48 - 13:55)
there's actually a an icon (13:52 - 13:57)
for it (13:55 - 14:00)
which uh the pokemon trading card game (13:57 - 14:03)
online icon is it's like a dark blue (14:00 - 14:05)
with a yellow (14:03 - 14:06)
border (14:05 - 14:08)
and then i think there's like a pokeball (14:06 - 14:09)
in the middle i don't even remember what (14:08 - 14:11)
it looks like but this new app is (14:09 - 14:14)
two little cards with pokeballs on them (14:11 - 14:18)
and then a light blue background so (14:14 - 14:21)
the icon is different (14:18 - 14:21)
the name is different (14:22 - 14:28)
and fusion strike is due out (14:24 - 14:31)
oh okay it's august october november (14:28 - 14:33)
fusion strike should be due out in (14:31 - 14:35)
november december i think every three (14:33 - 14:36)
months (14:35 - 14:39)
so that would (14:36 - 14:39)
be by the end of the year (14:39 - 14:43)
uh yes we are in agreement yep (14:44 - 14:52)
this is like the one thing i've wanted (14:48 - 14:54)
for a long time is it better that is not (14:52 - 14:56)
true there are many things that you've (14:54 - 14:58)
wanted for a long time but this is one (14:56 - 15:00)
of the things that you have been most (14:58 - 15:04)
vocal about wanting i'm not even like (15:00 - 15:07)
my team my tcg days are behind me right (15:04 - 15:08)
like (15:07 - 15:10)
only with that negative attitude i (15:08 - 15:12)
started playing the tcg when i was older (15:10 - 15:14)
than you are right now (15:12 - 15:16)
that's true (15:14 - 15:17)
like i don't think i would ever get back (15:16 - 15:19)
into like the competitive pokemon well (15:17 - 15:22)
like what about when your kids are going (15:19 - 15:23)
to pokemon (15:22 - 15:27)
tournaments and you're gonna (15:23 - 15:27)
their ears off and then as soon as i (15:29 - 15:34)
start losing i become rude and (15:31 - 15:35)
disrespectful (15:34 - 15:38)
and you start you also start cheating (15:35 - 15:39)
because (15:38 - 15:42)
it doesn't matter i'm just a poke dad (15:39 - 15:44)
what i do it doesn't count judge this (15:42 - 15:46)
ten-year-old is using illegal dice judge (15:44 - 15:48)
no no no no no this is the thing greg (15:46 - 15:50)
this is like one of the key things that (15:48 - 15:52)
drove me out (15:50 - 15:53)
of playing (15:52 - 15:56)
the pokemon tcg is like the poke dads (15:53 - 15:58)
are all in the masters group which is (15:56 - 16:01)
literally oh is it like 16 years old (15:58 - 16:02)
right (16:01 - 16:05)
yeah and when they're winning (16:02 - 16:07)
they take the game seriously (16:05 - 16:09)
when they're losing (16:07 - 16:11)
they cheat and they say things like well (16:09 - 16:13)
it doesn't really matter i'm just here (16:11 - 16:16)
because my kids are here (16:13 - 16:17)
yeah but but you have to the important (16:16 - 16:21)
part is that divide of cheating (16:17 - 16:23)
seriously doesn't happen until about (16:21 - 16:26)
halfway through the match exactly like (16:23 - 16:28)
the first like five minutes they're like (16:26 - 16:30)
buddy buddy with you like you're about (16:28 - 16:32)
to get like coffee with them after the (16:30 - 16:34)
match but like there's this hard divide (16:32 - 16:36)
where they either become serious and (16:34 - 16:39)
like don't talk to me or like (16:36 - 16:42)
bitter and i'm cheating now (16:39 - 16:43)
they have (16:42 - 16:45)
one human interaction given to them (16:43 - 16:47)
that's with an adult and not with (16:45 - 16:49)
children involved and you're a part of (16:47 - 16:52)
it and it's gonna go their way or (16:49 - 16:54)
they're gonna get cranky look if i was (16:52 - 16:56)
locked in the house with my children 24 (16:54 - 16:58)
7 and the one time i got to go out and (16:56 - 17:00)
play a game with a fellow adult it got (16:58 - 17:03)
bad heck yeah i'm cheating oh this is my (17:00 - 17:05)
one chance for glory before i have to go (17:03 - 17:08)
get to be stepped on by my children if (17:05 - 17:11)
you ever want to get a poke dad and and (17:08 - 17:13)
a pokemon let's this is it it applies to (17:11 - 17:16)
all if you seriously want to tilt them (17:13 - 17:19)
let them know that you're there and you (17:16 - 17:20)
don't have kids (17:19 - 17:23)
oh yeah that's my job that is my joy in (17:20 - 17:25)
life my joy in life is telling people (17:23 - 17:27)
who are trying to control their kids i (17:25 - 17:28)
go (17:27 - 17:30)
i made different life choices i can (17:28 - 17:32)
leave you now and i don't i can lock my (17:30 - 17:35)
dogs up at home and nobody calls social (17:32 - 17:37)
services on me because that's what you (17:35 - 17:40)
do to dogs you put them into a cage (17:37 - 17:43)
can't do that with your kids can you (17:40 - 17:43)
pokey moms (17:44 - 17:49)
much much more rarer than pokey dads (17:46 - 17:52)
but they are true that i have had some (17:49 - 17:55)
brutal pokemons they will (17:52 - 17:58)
like i feel like the poking (17:55 - 18:01)
the pokey dads like they get like huffy (17:58 - 18:02)
and puffy (18:01 - 18:04)
but the pokey moms (18:02 - 18:06)
they will tell you right to their face (18:04 - 18:08)
that they are unhappy that they can't (18:06 - 18:12)
believe they're losing to you (18:08 - 18:15)
heck has no fury like a pokemon score (18:12 - 18:16)
they are (18:15 - 18:18)
there they make you rethink what you're (18:16 - 18:19)
doing with life (18:18 - 18:23)
um pokemon tcg live good name very (18:19 - 18:25)
simple understand (18:23 - 18:27)
hopefully this is a new app there's a (18:25 - 18:28)
lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of (18:27 - 18:31)
speculation here is it going to import (18:28 - 18:32)
everything from pokemon trading card (18:31 - 18:34)
game online probably it seems like it (18:32 - 18:36)
would be pretty easy to import your (18:34 - 18:39)
database the fact (18:36 - 18:41)
that pokemon trading card game online (18:39 - 18:45)
has existed since 2012 i believe (18:41 - 18:47)
it is 11 years (18:45 - 18:49)
10 years old whatever a decade old (18:47 - 18:53)
the fact that that app even works (18:49 - 18:55)
is a miracle if that app can remember (18:53 - 18:58)
all of your cards (18:55 - 19:01)
i am sure that it's just some excel (18:58 - 19:03)
csv that you can export and then import (19:01 - 19:06)
into i mean the new one that's where (19:03 - 19:07)
janine went after she left pokemon go (19:06 - 19:11)
calendar she moved over to databasing on (19:07 - 19:14)
the excel spreadsheet so so like is this (19:11 - 19:16)
a new app is it making by is it being (19:14 - 19:18)
made by direwolf digital is it going to (19:16 - 19:21)
be able to import your stuff is it going (19:18 - 19:24)
to be restricted to uh ios android is (19:21 - 19:26)
there a pc app is there a (19:24 - 19:29)
mac app is it coming to the nintendo (19:26 - 19:30)
switch (19:29 - 19:32)
i'm excited but there's too many (19:30 - 19:35)
questions at this point (19:32 - 19:37)
i know somebody who works at the pokemon (19:35 - 19:39)
company international who really really (19:37 - 19:42)
loves a particular type of omelette that (19:39 - 19:45)
you can get at ihop i think they can be (19:42 - 19:48)
persuaded to spill the beans (19:45 - 19:50)
what (19:48 - 19:53)
i know what you're talking about uh (19:50 - 19:55)
when i talk when i talk to them he's (19:53 - 19:57)
like i know who you're talking about (19:55 - 19:58)
when i talk to them (19:57 - 20:01)

okay we we have a we have a lot to talk (22:54 - 22:57)
about let's let's get the season of (22:56 - 22:59)
mischief out of the way first (22:57 - 23:01)
because that will that will be from (22:59 - 23:04)
september 1st (23:01 - 23:06)
through the rest of the year because (23:04 - 23:07)
seasons are four months four months (23:06 - 23:09)
three months four months three months (23:07 - 23:11)
three months four in a 12 month period (23:09 - 23:14)
and that's three (23:11 - 23:16)
uh trainers strange events in pokemon go (23:14 - 23:18)
continue in the season of mischief the (23:16 - 23:20)
season will focus around the adventure (23:18 - 23:23)
of featuring hoopa the mischief pokemon (23:20 - 23:24)
which you will be able to encounter (23:23 - 23:27)
early in this season's special research (23:24 - 23:30)
story misunderstood mischief when hoopa (23:27 - 23:32)
summons a legendary pokemon pokemon go (23:30 - 23:34)
when hoopa summoned the legendary (23:32 - 23:36)
pokemon in pokemon go go fest time and (23:34 - 23:38)
space were distorted (23:36 - 23:40)
hoopa also brought pokemon originally (23:38 - 23:42)
discovered in the gala region to go for (23:40 - 23:44)
the first time be sure to follow along (23:42 - 23:45)
during the season to see what else will (23:44 - 23:47)
happen this will go from september 1st (23:45 - 23:50)
through december 1st (23:47 - 23:52)
and (23:50 - 23:53)
you will be able to access parts of the (23:52 - 23:55)
season's special ripper story when (23:53 - 23:56)
certain events begin the special (23:55 - 23:58)
research story will focus on discovering (23:56 - 24:00)
more about hoopa and the strange (23:58 - 24:01)
occurrences happening throughout the (24:00 - 24:02)
season so stay tuned and follow along (24:01 - 24:04)
the story if you complete the season's (24:02 - 24:06)
special research you will gain access to (24:04 - 24:08)
a special event at the end of the season (24:06 - 24:09)
that might have something to do with (24:08 - 24:11)
hoopa hoopa can not be transferred to (24:09 - 24:13)
pokemon home for now (24:11 - 24:15)
trainers (24:13 - 24:16)
unable to play during the season (24:15 - 24:18)
confined hoopa may be available again in (24:16 - 24:20)
the future (24:18 - 24:22)
so let's start here not a lot of people (24:20 - 24:23)
have hoopa (24:22 - 24:25)
um i don't know (24:23 - 24:28)
mcdonald's like 500 yeah like what was (24:25 - 24:30)
the problem here i did it i wouldn't get (24:28 - 24:32)
into mcdonald's parking lot not getting (24:30 - 24:35)
their food because gross and did my (24:32 - 24:37)
stuff on (24:35 - 24:39)
four different cartridges and then i (24:37 - 24:40)
left (24:39 - 24:43)
uh there was two hoopa distributions one (24:40 - 24:46)
was the mcdonald's one one was the (24:43 - 24:48)
year of mythical one i believe yeah (24:46 - 24:49)
correct (24:48 - 24:51)
so this would be the third mythical (24:49 - 24:54)
distribution technically i guess (24:51 - 24:55)
uh i don't think that transferring to (24:54 - 24:56)
home is that big of a deal because it (24:55 - 24:58)
literally says something will happen at (24:56 - 25:00)
the end of the season and i'm assuming (24:58 - 25:01)
you're probably going to need hoopa to (25:00 - 25:02)
like (25:01 - 25:04)
i i'm guessing one of the tasks is like (25:02 - 25:06)
take a picture of hoopa (25:04 - 25:07)
and then once that like research is (25:06 - 25:09)
probably over you'll be able to transfer (25:07 - 25:10)
it so i don't think it's the end of the (25:09 - 25:11)
world (25:10 - 25:12)
um (25:11 - 25:14)
oh in that regards (25:12 - 25:16)
because hoopa is destroying the world (25:14 - 25:18)
with his hoops (25:16 - 25:20)
because they they do say (25:18 - 25:21)
um (25:20 - 25:23)
hoopa cannot be transferred to pokemon (25:21 - 25:24)
home for now (25:23 - 25:26)
so (25:24 - 25:27)
i think we're good (25:26 - 25:30)
there uh (25:27 - 25:33)
the revamped pokemon go live is like (25:30 - 25:35)
lays this out very well (25:33 - 25:38)
uh and they they they updated it where (25:35 - 25:39)
instead of being like (25:38 - 25:41)
you can find jigglypuffs slowpoke (25:39 - 25:43)
chickarita they have like little (25:41 - 25:47)
pictures of them so it it's very nice (25:43 - 25:51)
uh what do we have here so we have (25:47 - 25:52)
the season of mission begin hoopa will (25:51 - 25:55)
play pranks on the team leaders and (25:52 - 25:58)
professor willow by taking his glasses (25:55 - 25:59)
it is up to you to learn more about the (25:58 - 26:01)

noibat i also don't like what they're (29:11 - 29:16)
doing with mega evolution here there's (29:14 - 29:19)
they're giving a whole month to slow bro (29:16 - 29:22)
a whole month so the slow bro september (29:19 - 29:24)
gengar's october hey for the first time (29:22 - 29:27)
they did ghosts in october good job (29:24 - 29:30)
took him five years (29:27 - 29:33)
the 25th anniversary saved (29:30 - 29:36)
hound doom in november (29:33 - 29:38)
i think that's like (29:36 - 29:41)
i i just i i i'm not a hundred percent (29:38 - 29:42)
sure what they're thinking with this (29:41 - 29:45)
maybe i'll ask them but like (29:42 - 29:48)
people already don't like mega raids (29:45 - 29:50)
because they would rather spend their (29:48 - 29:54)
raid passes on a legendary raid (29:50 - 29:56)
which i get (29:54 - 29:58)
i i can see both sides i mean maybe the (29:56 - 30:01)
thought process is like one or two weeks (29:58 - 30:03)
isn't enough and then people feel like (30:01 - 30:05)
well the week's almost over they need to (30:03 - 30:07)
do three slow pokes so if we do the (30:05 - 30:09)
whole month maybe like they can at least (30:07 - 30:10)
do one a week and by the end of the (30:09 - 30:13)
month they have everything (30:10 - 30:16)
but like for me i'm i'm like literally (30:13 - 30:19)
literally 10 candy away from mega (30:16 - 30:21)
evolving altaria and i'm just thinking (30:19 - 30:23)
like that's 90 days of me still not (30:21 - 30:27)
getting mega altaria walk with like (30:23 - 30:28)
no because you can't walk with it until (30:27 - 30:31)
once you make of all this (30:28 - 30:33)
here's the thing the thing that is (30:31 - 30:35)
throwing me off is (30:33 - 30:38)
their three month (30:35 - 30:39)
seasons (30:38 - 30:41)
are different than what i'm used to at (30:39 - 30:44)
work so i expected this to be (30:41 - 30:46)
october november december because you're (30:44 - 30:47)
closing out the year (30:46 - 30:49)
but there's a september october november (30:47 - 30:51)
and i'm like yeah this is (30:49 - 30:54)
this is weird why are you doing it (30:51 - 30:56)
i mean it's fine it just is weirding me (30:54 - 30:58)
out a lot (30:56 - 31:00)
well technically winter does start in (30:58 - 31:03)
december they're they're really not long (31:00 - 31:06)
december 21st the end of december there (31:03 - 31:07)
are (31:06 - 31:12)
10 days left of december that are winter (31:07 - 31:12)
yeah i mean i guess they can like do (31:15 - 31:18)
events to be like hey this weekend mega (31:16 - 31:22)
altaria spawning or something it just (31:18 - 31:22)
they could just make a general mega (31:24 - 31:27)
candy (31:26 - 31:29)
can you just make a general mega candy (31:27 - 31:31)
that can be applied to all of them just (31:29 - 31:34)
after raids have it like be the raid (31:31 - 31:37)
candy and you can choose which mega you (31:34 - 31:40)
want to apply the candy to (31:37 - 31:40)
yeah i i think (31:42 - 31:48)
problem solved 25th anniversary saved (31:45 - 31:51)
i i genuinely like megas in pogo like (31:48 - 31:53)
it's so much more interesting than they (31:51 - 31:56)
were in like x and y in x and y the only (31:53 - 31:58)
thing you could do is like mega evolve (31:56 - 32:00)
roast that caterpie on a root and then (31:58 - 32:03)
like mega evolve against the elite four (32:00 - 32:05)
and then like mega evolve in like pvp (32:03 - 32:07)
battle that's all you could do in those (32:05 - 32:08)
games like unless i'm wrong i don't (32:07 - 32:10)
think you like mega evolve and then like (32:08 - 32:14)
do that x and y soccer mini game right (32:10 - 32:15)
correct where (32:14 - 32:17)
like you could only make it yeah i don't (32:15 - 32:19)
even remember the soccer minigame what i (32:17 - 32:21)
played the heck out of that that's the (32:19 - 32:22)
only way to get some of the uh like (32:21 - 32:25)
evolution items that you need man you (32:22 - 32:27)
bring talonflame into that game (32:25 - 32:29)
heck yeah that soccer mini game was like (32:27 - 32:31)
mostly for ev trading wasn't it uh well (32:29 - 32:33)
it did that too but the you would get (32:31 - 32:35)
rewards for different like yeah (32:33 - 32:37)
if you if you needed some evolution (32:35 - 32:39)
items you could get them yeah easiest (32:37 - 32:41)
way to get them was as rewards for (32:39 - 32:42)
playing that game i thought we were (32:41 - 32:44)
talking about because i was thinking (32:42 - 32:46)
black and white of it's in boston city (32:44 - 32:48)
that has the soccer field (32:46 - 32:50)
or the baseball oh yeah i was like what (32:48 - 32:53)
mini game was there baseball and (32:50 - 32:55)
basketball yeah yes whatever what that (32:53 - 32:57)
was sports and sports you couldn't hear (32:55 - 33:00)
you whatever even like mega involved sir (32:57 - 33:02)
i'm not black and white was great (33:00 - 33:05)
whatever brings sports (33:02 - 33:06)
like you couldn't even mega evolve and (33:05 - 33:09)
like pet them right like pokemon refresh (33:06 - 33:10)
or me you couldn't yeah (33:09 - 33:12)
i don't remember you could do it it was (33:10 - 33:13)
only in battle so like when you mega (33:12 - 33:14)
evolve and go (33:13 - 33:15)
they like (33:14 - 33:17)
well i get you could walk with them they (33:15 - 33:19)
could follow you you get the (33:17 - 33:21)
bonuses when you catch they're great for (33:19 - 33:23)
team rocket battles they're great for (33:21 - 33:26)
raids like (33:23 - 33:29)
you can take pictures of them (33:26 - 33:29)
i like i like it i like it a lot it (33:29 - 33:34)
feels like a good use of the eight hours (33:31 - 33:38)
i'm into it (33:34 - 33:38)
but no one else cares about no no no one (33:38 - 33:42)
else cares about megan (33:40 - 33:44)
no (33:42 - 33:46)
nobody does (33:44 - 33:46)
okay dino transformations there seems to (33:47 - 33:52)
be species where okay so ditto can be a (33:49 - 33:55)
ghastly uh uh uh drowsy uh remembered a (33:52 - 33:59)
teddy ursa gulpin a new number numo uh (33:55 - 34:02)
it's the stunt the the the stunk i can't (33:59 - 34:06)
remember that thing's name bubble stunky (34:02 - 34:06)
did say (34:07 - 34:09)
that (34:08 - 34:12)
so some of these pokemon can be shiny (34:09 - 34:14)
so like drowsy ghastly (34:12 - 34:17)
level they can be shiny (34:14 - 34:17)
if they're shiny (34:18 - 34:23)
they cannot be ditto (34:20 - 34:25)
so they did fix this (34:23 - 34:27)
so if you if you find a shiny drowsy you (34:25 - 34:29)
don't have to worry about it turning (34:27 - 34:31)
into a ditto (34:29 - 34:33)
what is it it wouldn't even turn into a (34:31 - 34:35)
shiny did it would it it'd just be like (34:33 - 34:37)
i don't think so (34:35 - 34:39)
i can get clarification on that but i (34:37 - 34:40)
saw like three (34:39 - 34:42)
content creators i'll tweet that like (34:40 - 34:44)
hey if it's shiny it can't be ditto if (34:42 - 34:48)
ditto is shiny when in the regular game (34:44 - 34:51)
and then it transforms into the opponent (34:48 - 34:53)
does it stay shiny (34:51 - 34:55)
i don't think so that's silly (34:53 - 34:56)
i know (34:55 - 34:59)
ditto your shiny ditto (34:56 - 35:01)
in pokemon go i believe turns into the (34:59 - 35:03)
shiny version oh does it (35:01 - 35:05)
i think so (35:03 - 35:06)
i don't know i don't i don't think it (35:05 - 35:07)
did i don't think it does in the game (35:06 - 35:09)
does it (35:07 - 35:10)
i don't know the thing that they need to (35:09 - 35:13)
change in the main series games is when (35:10 - 35:14)
the ditto transforms into the other (35:13 - 35:16)
pokemon it still needs to have the ditto (35:14 - 35:19)
face that would be that is an anime (35:16 - 35:21)
specific thing only then yeah but i'm so (35:19 - 35:23)
into it (35:21 - 35:26)
it's so good only that ditto was bad at (35:23 - 35:28)
being a ditto (35:26 - 35:31)
i like bad ditto (35:28 - 35:33)
i'm into that okay (35:31 - 35:36)
uh that is (35:33 - 35:40)
the part one of the season of mischief i (35:36 - 35:41)
think (35:40 - 35:44)
for a lot of i would i would assume or (35:41 - 35:46)
maybe hope for a lot of people that are (35:44 - 35:48)
maybe like casual pogo or maybe they (35:46 - 35:50)
took a break from pogo (35:48 - 35:53)
i i feel like hoopa is a pretty good (35:50 - 35:54)
draw (35:53 - 35:55)
um (35:54 - 35:57)
i mean like it's a mythical (35:55 - 35:59)
not a lot of people have the mythical (35:57 - 36:01)
or people do but the people who don't (35:59 - 36:03)
have the mythical really like to remind (36:01 - 36:04)
you that they don't have it and they're (36:03 - 36:06)
still looking for it i understand it (36:04 - 36:09)
sucks when you're missing one pokemon um (36:06 - 36:11)
and it seems i mean usually a special (36:09 - 36:13)
research story is well they say season (36:11 - 36:15)
long special research story well so (36:13 - 36:16)
we'll see i know there was a huge debate (36:15 - 36:19)
about like hey i paid ten dollars to get (36:16 - 36:21)
shiny mew and now this task takes me (36:19 - 36:24)
like three months but (36:21 - 36:24)
they also said that that was supposed to (36:24 - 36:27)
be long i mean well they didn't say it's (36:25 - 36:28)
supposed to be long but they kind of (36:27 - 36:30)
like it will be long they hinted that (36:28 - 36:33)
it's going to be long so (36:30 - 36:35)
we have more pokemon go news and we're (36:33 - 36:36)
going to talk about the distance stuff (36:35 - 36:39)
which was you know a big thing from (36:36 - 36:41)
two weeks ago because we skipped it last (36:39 - 36:43)
week so we will be (36:41 - 36:45)
right back (36:43 - 36:49)
[Music] (36:45 - 36:50)

[Music] (37:24 - 37:39)
and we are back from our break (37:35 - 37:41)
coming in september okay (37:39 - 37:43)
so season of mischief three months (37:41 - 37:45)
uh they're changing some things here (37:43 - 37:47)
every monday in september you're gonna (37:45 - 37:50)
get one uh one coin bundle giving you a (37:47 - 37:52)
free remote raid passes and some other (37:50 - 37:54)
stuff so that's back that's cool (37:52 - 37:55)
uh (37:54 - 37:58)
nature is healing because lugia will be (37:55 - 37:59)
back in raids (37:58 - 38:01)
finally (37:59 - 38:03)
it's been so long who (38:01 - 38:05)
at this point playing pokemon go has not (38:03 - 38:09)
done at least 21 (38:05 - 38:09)
i'm sure ho o is right around the corner (38:10 - 38:14)
here ho o is always around the corner (38:12 - 38:17)
where there's the lugia there's a ho (38:14 - 38:20)
um lugia will have the attack aerial (38:17 - 38:22)
blast will appear from september 1st (38:20 - 38:24)
through september 14th (38:22 - 38:25)
uh (38:24 - 38:27)
this is how (38:25 - 38:29)
i'm not falling i'm not i'm done (38:27 - 38:31)
i'm not falling for (38:29 - 38:33)
it ooxy (38:31 - 38:36)
mesprit and as elf (38:33 - 38:37)
will be appearing in five star raids (38:36 - 38:41)
between the 14th through october 1st (38:37 - 38:42)
they will (38:41 - 38:45)
be shiny this time around i think this (38:42 - 38:47)
is the third time this could be shiny (38:45 - 38:49)
they could be could be if you're lucky (38:47 - 38:50)
they could be only if you're lucky if (38:49 - 38:52)
you're not lucky you're not never that (38:50 - 38:53)
lucky (38:52 - 38:54)
so (38:53 - 38:56)
uh they introduced the like spirits (38:54 - 38:57)
initially right (38:56 - 39:00)
to their respective region my spirit is (38:57 - 39:01)
europe (39:00 - 39:03)
middle east africa india as elf is (39:01 - 39:05)
america and greenland shout out to (39:03 - 39:07)
maybe the two people we have in (39:05 - 39:09)
greenland that listen to the podcast uxi (39:07 - 39:12)
is the asia's pacific area (39:09 - 39:14)
first time there was no remote raid (39:12 - 39:16)
passes you just did them (39:14 - 39:17)
second time they came around you could (39:16 - 39:19)
remote raid pass into them (39:17 - 39:22)
this is the third time (39:19 - 39:23)
you can remote right past they could be (39:22 - 39:24)
shiny (39:23 - 39:27)
i really personally don't think it's (39:24 - 39:29)
that different than anyone else i mean (39:27 - 39:30)
people are like oh it's region specific (39:29 - 39:31)
but (39:30 - 39:32)
i i (39:31 - 39:35)
feel like most of our audience at least (39:32 - 39:37)
our audience is just remote raid pass (39:35 - 39:39)
central so what does it matter if it's (39:37 - 39:41)
like they're using remote rate passes (39:39 - 39:43)
for zashi and they're using remote raid (39:41 - 39:44)
passes for dialga (39:43 - 39:46)
so it's really i mean there are a lot of (39:44 - 39:48)
people that use it i think it's helpful (39:46 - 39:51)
when you can get it for a coin because (39:48 - 39:52)
people have been inviting me and i'm (39:51 - 39:55)
like i'm out of passes so no it is (39:52 - 39:57)
definitely helpful to be like (39:55 - 39:58)
i'm only going to use my free raid pass (39:57 - 40:00)
if you want to join me that's fine i'm (39:58 - 40:03)
not spending money but you can also (40:00 - 40:06)
psa if you invite me to a remote raid (40:03 - 40:10)
and i go and i invite you yeah no and i (40:06 - 40:12)
invite you to remote raid and you don't (40:10 - 40:14)
show up (40:12 - 40:15)
well now we're going to have words (40:14 - 40:17)
friends just (40:15 - 40:19)
if you're going to invite me give me a (40:17 - 40:22)
heads up on something other than the (40:19 - 40:24)
game because it's always so delayed and (40:22 - 40:27)
i get the message and i'm like well (40:24 - 40:30)
i'm sure i got this after the time of (40:27 - 40:32)
joining that lobby is over (40:30 - 40:34)
because it is not good at updating me so (40:32 - 40:36)
just hey (40:34 - 40:39)
instagram twitter slack (40:36 - 40:40)
wherever you can find me say hey do you (40:39 - 40:42)
want to do this roadway page i'm going (40:40 - 40:45)

i just (40:45 - 40:48)
i am (40:46 - 40:50)
i just can't i just cannot care about (40:48 - 40:52)
the lake spirits enough to be like i'm (40:50 - 40:54)
gonna shiny hunt these (40:52 - 40:55)
i mean (40:54 - 40:58)
there was a point in pogo (40:55 - 40:59)
where they were introducing like one (40:58 - 41:01)

that money for all that pokemon go has (42:48 - 42:54)
to be coming from some place (42:51 - 42:56)
hey let's put those pieces together (42:54 - 42:59)
shout out to bobby and al obviously (42:56 - 43:01)
we're an hour into this episode and we (42:59 - 43:02)
haven't talked about diamond and pearl (43:01 - 43:06)
or arceus probably won't be able to but (43:02 - 43:08)
uh we did a bonus podcast on patreon (43:06 - 43:11)
this past week uh where it's 90 minutes (43:08 - 43:13)
with bobby and al we go all through (43:11 - 43:15)

kind of stuff so uh if you want to (43:15 - 43:18)

maybe would just wait till september (43:51 - 43:55)
first so you don't get charged twice (43:52 - 43:56)
but (43:55 - 43:58)
that being said it's not like we're not (43:56 - 43:59)
ever going to talk about diamond and (43:58 - 44:01)
pearl legends just probably not this (43:59 - 44:02)
week since there wasn't really any new (44:01 - 44:04)
developments or anything (44:02 - 44:05)
um (44:04 - 44:07)

the event so this is the first time we (45:13 - 45:17)
get two (45:15 - 45:18)
no i think charizard had something with (45:17 - 45:19)
like dragon breath or oh probably (45:18 - 45:21)
something like this whatever it doesn't (45:19 - 45:22)
matter (45:21 - 45:25)
um (45:22 - 45:26)
hoopa's one day event will take place (45:25 - 45:28)
sunday september 5th we talked about (45:26 - 45:31)
that that's the psychic then the rose (45:28 - 45:34)
then back to the psychic (45:31 - 45:35)
the (45:34 - 45:38)
psychic spectacular (45:35 - 45:39)
will (45:38 - 45:42)
start on wednesday september 8th through (45:39 - 45:44)
september 13th (45:42 - 45:46)
some familiar faces will be returning (45:44 - 45:48)
and another pokemon will make its (45:46 - 45:50)
pokemon go debut (45:48 - 45:53)
which will it be here's a hint be (45:50 - 45:56)
careful of revolving too much of your (45:53 - 45:59)
life around one thing you might find (45:56 - 46:00)
that it could overturn (45:59 - 46:04)
at a moment's notice (46:00 - 46:06)
am i dumb what is this (46:04 - 46:07)
alcremy (46:06 - 46:09)
overturn (46:07 - 46:12)
he's not psychic (46:09 - 46:14)
does it have to be psychic yeah it's the (46:12 - 46:17)
same spectacular pokemon of the week (46:14 - 46:18)
clue again (46:17 - 46:20)
is niantic stealing your content well (46:18 - 46:22)
yeah i know absolutely or maybe they (46:20 - 46:25)
secretly okay so it says it's debuting (46:22 - 46:27)
during the psychic spectacular (46:25 - 46:29)
right (46:27 - 46:32)
the hint is be careful of revolving too (46:29 - 46:35)
much of your life around one thing (46:32 - 46:39)
it could overturn at a moment's notice (46:35 - 46:40)
um (46:39 - 46:43)
and i feel like we're limited to gen (46:40 - 46:46)
6 pokemon and gen 8 because they skipped (46:43 - 46:49)
channel 7. (46:46 - 46:49)
i wish i had more time to think about (46:53 - 46:57)
this before we started the show i didn't (46:55 - 46:59)
read that one line i (46:57 - 47:01)
i mean (46:59 - 47:02)
wait (47:01 - 47:05)
i'm trying to go through what is in (47:02 - 47:08)
the game (47:05 - 47:08)
now because er solos this is in the game (47:09 - 47:15)
yeah celestis is in the game yeah (47:12 - 47:17)
but that's not about revolving or (47:15 - 47:20)
overturning (47:17 - 47:21)
pumpkaboo (47:20 - 47:25)
no let's go (47:21 - 47:25)
because it's a dark and psychic and (47:29 - 47:34)
ghost event yeah yeah (47:30 - 47:36)
so wait what is the over the overturn is (47:34 - 47:37)
probably turn your phone upside down (47:36 - 47:40)
also malamar is the overturning pokemon (47:37 - 47:43)
yeah that's its species (47:40 - 47:43)
oh well (47:46 - 47:49)
well i thought it was gonna be something (47:48 - 47:50)
exciting and that was just in k and in (47:49 - 47:53)
case it's not that (47:50 - 47:53)
becomes a cthulhu nightmare and we talk (47:59 - 48:04)
about amazing but also like a pokemon (48:02 - 48:07)
that has like interesting ability (48:04 - 48:10)
it's an interesting typing it's it's it (48:07 - 48:13)
does cool stuff can we talk about (48:10 - 48:16)
the actual good gen 6 pokemon (48:13 - 48:17)
which is (48:16 - 48:19)
fur fruit (48:17 - 48:22)
what what what about it perfect is great (48:19 - 48:24)
yeah (48:22 - 48:24)
yeah (48:24 - 48:26)
was that normal type gym leader thing (48:24 - 48:27)
was that a tick tock or was it an (48:26 - 48:30)
instagram reel uh yes (48:27 - 48:32)
it's on all of them oh dang that was (48:30 - 48:35)
really good that was very good (48:32 - 48:37)
i send steve good things he's like it's (48:35 - 48:39)
too long like listen here short (48:37 - 48:41)
attention span theater (48:39 - 48:42)
yeah oh yeah i need i need a short okay (48:41 - 48:44)
so fashion week is coming stylishly (48:42 - 48:46)
dressed pokemon will be making their (48:44 - 48:50)
debut along with fluffy and fashionable (48:46 - 48:50)
for fruit (48:50 - 48:52)
yes (48:50 - 48:54)
stuff with these fashionable styles new (48:52 - 48:57)
ev the reason okay so when real talk (48:54 - 48:59)
when gen 6 came out i didn't really like (48:57 - 49:01)
furfuru didn't really get it the thing (48:59 - 49:03)
that really sold me on fur fruit was (49:01 - 49:06)
when the ultra recon squad had a fur (49:03 - 49:08)
fruit and they didn't understand it (49:06 - 49:09)
and then (49:08 - 49:10)
they like (49:09 - 49:12)
if you didn't have the right pokemon (49:10 - 49:14)
that fur fruit was almost unbeatable (49:12 - 49:16)
because of its ability because it had (49:14 - 49:19)
like super super high defense and you (49:16 - 49:21)
were like level 14. i mean the fur fruit (49:19 - 49:24)
couple in x and y are the nuzlocke (49:21 - 49:28)
enders because fur fruit is a beast (49:24 - 49:28)
um so the fashion week is september 21st (49:29 - 49:33)
through september 28th what do you mean (49:31 - 49:34)
you didn't get it (49:33 - 49:37)
it's a super cute ass it's a super cute (49:34 - 49:38)
fluffy dog (49:37 - 49:40)
oh it's a poodle it's not an afghan yeah (49:38 - 49:42)
it's a poodle i just say there's a (49:40 - 49:43)
napkin it could be but it's it's a (49:42 - 49:44)
poodle (49:43 - 49:46)
team rockets (49:44 - 49:48)
boss seems to me missing something (49:46 - 49:49)
where's giovanni gone we hope he's not (49:48 - 49:51)
planning something in the shadows be (49:49 - 49:52)
sure to keep an eye out for an update (49:51 - 49:54)
throughout the season super rocket (49:52 - 49:55)
radars will not be available to track (49:54 - 49:57)
down giovanni during the time so no need (49:55 - 49:59)
to keep them equipped (49:57 - 50:01)
there is also a new evolution preview (49:59 - 50:03)
coming (50:01 - 50:05)
battlers rejoice you will soon be able (50:03 - 50:07)
to preview your pokemon's post evolution (50:05 - 50:09)
cp before you evolve it this new (50:07 - 50:10)
evolution screen will display the (50:09 - 50:12)
following the current pokemon and cp the (50:10 - 50:15)
pokemon's evolution and its new cp and (50:12 - 50:17)
which leagues the evolved pokemon would (50:15 - 50:19)
be qualified for this new feature will (50:17 - 50:21)
go live sometime in september we hope (50:19 - 50:23)
you better we hope it will help you (50:21 - 50:24)
better determine which pokemon to power (50:23 - 50:26)
up i love this (50:24 - 50:29)
the it still doesn't fix the problem of (50:26 - 50:32)
locking yeah there needs to be a way to (50:29 - 50:34)
lock a pokemon so you don't accidentally (50:32 - 50:36)
power it up or you don't accidentally (50:34 - 50:38)
evolve it where you can like tag it and (50:36 - 50:40)
that tag locks it of like this is only (50:38 - 50:42)
great league you can't accidentally (50:40 - 50:44)
overpower it you can't accidentally hit (50:42 - 50:46)
the evolve button (50:44 - 50:46)
i don't know it doesn't say that it does (50:47 - 50:50)
that but i feel like that is the thing i (50:48 - 50:51)
need (50:50 - 50:53)
is oh i why am i keeping this certain (50:51 - 50:54)
squirtle (50:53 - 50:57)
i tagged it gbl (50:54 - 50:59)
but then i accidentally transferred it (50:57 - 51:01)
or accidentally like (50:59 - 51:02)
powered it up too much i don't know (51:01 - 51:04)
maybe that's just a me problem and i (51:02 - 51:06)
feel like a problem i don't i don't (51:04 - 51:08)
battle league until i have to and i go (51:06 - 51:10)
in and do my one thing and like thanks (51:08 - 51:11)
i'm out (51:10 - 51:13)
okay so those are all the changes with (51:11 - 51:17)
uh the the season of mischief (51:13 - 51:18)
uh (51:17 - 51:21)
i did go to the niantic task force (51:18 - 51:23)
meeting (51:21 - 51:25)
they (51:23 - 51:27)
i am allowed to talk about it (51:25 - 51:29)
you probably saw other content creators (51:27 - 51:31)
slightly talk about it the one thing i'm (51:29 - 51:33)
i'm gonna give it to greg and well to (51:31 - 51:34)
ask me questions because i'm not sure (51:33 - 51:36)
exactly what to say that i haven't (51:34 - 51:37)
already said (51:36 - 51:39)
but the only thing i'm not allowed to (51:37 - 51:40)
say is (51:39 - 51:41)
who (51:40 - 51:42)
i talked to (51:41 - 51:45)
there were a bunch of niantic people i'm (51:42 - 51:47)
not allowed to give their names or give (51:45 - 51:49)
away who they were that was the one (51:47 - 51:51)
request that niantic said i have had (51:49 - 51:53)
plenty of meetings with niantic before (51:51 - 51:54)
uh for whatever reason niantic is a (51:53 - 51:56)
weird company they didn't really want us (51:54 - 51:57)
to talk about it in this situation (51:56 - 51:59)
because of i guess maybe the blowback (51:57 - 52:01)
they were like you're allowed to talk (51:59 - 52:04)
about this this is just the rule you're (52:01 - 52:06)
this is just our one request (52:04 - 52:07)
um (52:06 - 52:08)
maybe it's because people on twitter (52:07 - 52:11)
then go after yeah but that's probably (52:08 - 52:13)
why actually (52:11 - 52:14)
uh (52:13 - 52:17)
i mean liz liz has left the company (52:14 - 52:20)
uh i don't we talked about this before i (52:17 - 52:22)
don't think it's because of the issues (52:20 - 52:23)
obviously you know when you work for a (52:22 - 52:25)
tech company for three four five years (52:23 - 52:27)
really the only way to move up is by (52:25 - 52:28)
going to a different tech company this (52:27 - 52:31)
is kind of all jobs honestly not really (52:28 - 52:33)
limited to tech (52:31 - 52:35)
so i think at this point it's kind of (52:33 - 52:37)
har i would assume that the people i'm (52:35 - 52:38)
talking to (52:37 - 52:40)
they probably don't have a twitter (52:38 - 52:41)
presence or don't want people to find (52:40 - 52:42)
them on twitter (52:41 - 52:47)
niantic reversed the decision of the 40 (52:42 - 52:48)
back to 80. (52:47 - 52:51)
it was specifically (52:48 - 52:55)
they they only rolled out the the (52:51 - 52:57)
revert they they reversed it only in (52:55 - 53:00)
america and in new zealand (52:57 - 53:02)
new zealand a very small country of (53:00 - 53:03)
course (53:02 - 53:04)
and they (53:03 - 53:05)
la (53:04 - 53:06)
like a couple days before the america (53:05 - 53:08)
one they switched back (53:06 - 53:10)
it in new zealand first and then america (53:08 - 53:11)
was the only country that had the 40 to (53:10 - 53:12)
80. (53:11 - 53:14)
before i (53:12 - 53:16)
tell you what niantic told me uh wait (53:14 - 53:19)
and 40 to 80 means from you had to be 40 (53:16 - 53:21)
feet from a pokestop in order to be able (53:19 - 53:24)
to interact with it to 80 feet from no (53:21 - 53:27)
technical leaders technically 20 (53:24 - 53:29)
because the 40 (53:27 - 53:33)
is the diameter diameter okay so it's 20 (53:29 - 53:35)
all around but now it's within 20 feet (53:33 - 53:37)
of a pokey stopped (53:35 - 53:38)
meters (53:37 - 53:40)
i don't know what a meter is in a foot (53:38 - 53:43)
is one meter one three feet to a meter (53:40 - 53:45)
just about okay so one meter is three (53:43 - 53:47)
feet so they went from (53:45 - 53:49)
60 feet (53:47 - 53:53)
to interact with a pokey stop to 240 (53:49 - 53:56)
feet to interact with a poke stop that's (53:53 - 54:00)
a lot of feet not no not 240 120 feet 60 (53:56 - 54:02)
to 120. there you go (54:00 - 54:04)
roughly i mean it's a little bit more (54:02 - 54:05)
but whatever (54:04 - 54:06)
so i think some of the some of the (54:05 - 54:08)
problem with the lack of communication (54:06 - 54:10)
is people wildly speculate of why these (54:08 - 54:11)
things were made (54:10 - 54:14)
um and it did bother me that the thing i (54:11 - 54:16)
saw a lot was like (54:14 - 54:19)
the reason that niantic went from 80 to (54:16 - 54:21)
40 was because of sponsored stops and (54:19 - 54:23)
sponsor stops made their money and then (54:21 - 54:26)
when this when this reversed they were (54:23 - 54:28)
like see it was about money and it's (54:26 - 54:31)
like that doesn't make your logic three (54:28 - 54:33)
weeks ago about how it was sponsored (54:31 - 54:35)
stops and your logic now about how it's (54:33 - 54:38)
money doesn't make any sense because (54:35 - 54:39)
even even if you think like well they (54:38 - 54:41)
reversed it because of money spoiler (54:39 - 54:43)
they didn't (54:41 - 54:45)
if you if you're if you sincerely (54:43 - 54:47)
believe they reversed it because they (54:45 - 54:48)
didn't make enough money in the last (54:47 - 54:51)
three weeks (54:48 - 54:51)
what (54:51 - 54:53)
are you (54:52 - 54:56)
one you have to be american because you (54:53 - 54:58)
have to be so selfish and so clueless (54:56 - 55:01)
that this is a worldwide game and only (54:58 - 55:03)
like yeah i guess you could include new (55:01 - 55:04)
zealand but new zealand is so tiny (55:03 - 55:06)
compared to the rest of the world but (55:04 - 55:09)
like you have all of china you have all (55:06 - 55:12)
of japan you literally have the entire (55:09 - 55:14)
world still at 80 (55:12 - 55:16)
and you're saying that america had like (55:14 - 55:18)
don't get me wrong i'm sure america's (55:16 - 55:21)
top three maybe top five countries that (55:18 - 55:23)
make money for niantic but also they (55:21 - 55:25)
reversed it in a time where there was (55:23 - 55:27)
like no shiny dark cry no shiny deoxys (55:25 - 55:30)
like there wasn't really a lot happening (55:27 - 55:33)
like this last month where people would (55:30 - 55:35)
be like they already spent all their (55:33 - 55:38)
money on dialga and palkia like i ca i (55:35 - 55:40)
cannot imagine and again niantic told me (55:38 - 55:42)
it wasn't about money it was i can give (55:40 - 55:45)
you the reason in a little bit but (55:42 - 55:47)
the speculation was like oh this was all (55:45 - 55:50)
about money but your your logic of (55:47 - 55:52)
the beginning of it now the end of it (55:50 - 55:54)
just doesn't make sense right it is not (55:52 - 55:56)
a logical conclusion but i mean people (55:54 - 55:58)
aren't looking for logical conclusions (55:56 - 56:00)
and when you told me the reason i also (55:58 - 56:03)
said that's not a logical reason it's (56:00 - 56:05)
not it's it's it's (56:03 - 56:08)
i mean i disagree with greg on that when (56:05 - 56:10)
you told me the reason it made me (56:08 - 56:13)
so angry (56:10 - 56:17)
it still makes me angry (56:13 - 56:17)
i think a lot of (56:20 - 56:23)
i think at the end of the day everyone's (56:23 - 56:28)
human and everyone makes dumb decisions (56:25 - 56:30)
and there are plenty of huge companies (56:28 - 56:33)
apple microsoft mine whatever that make (56:30 - 56:35)
terror make sense they make dumb (56:33 - 56:37)
decisions yes and (56:35 - 56:39)
uh (56:37 - 56:42)
and so here here's their reason (56:39 - 56:44)
and when they when they said it to me i (56:42 - 56:47)
was like this makes sense even though (56:44 - 56:49)
it's i'm not defending it it is still (56:47 - 56:50)
dumb (56:49 - 56:53)
but it at least made sense (56:50 - 56:55)
so they were they started off the (56:53 - 56:57)
meeting and they said (56:55 - 56:59)
one before they even told us the reason (56:57 - 57:01)
they said one of the most frequently uh (56:59 - 57:03)
got asked questions was is this because (57:01 - 57:06)
of sponsored pokestops and they said no (57:03 - 57:08)
it wasn't and they said (57:06 - 57:11)
i'm paraphrasing here they said po (57:08 - 57:14)
sponsored pokestops is a small part of (57:11 - 57:15)
our business (57:14 - 57:17)
and it had and it had nothing to do with (57:15 - 57:20)
this decision at all (57:17 - 57:20)
which we've said on the show before that (57:20 - 57:24)
i don't we i said i don't think it's (57:22 - 57:26)
sponsored pokestops because what when (57:24 - 57:28)
what was the last new sponsored pokestop (57:26 - 57:31)
you saw in america (57:28 - 57:33)
name one like i remember the starbucks (57:31 - 57:35)
deal i remember the sprint deal that (57:33 - 57:37)
like i thought i saw a variety they had (57:35 - 57:38)
like a (57:37 - 57:40)
they had like a two-day grubhub thing at (57:38 - 57:42)
one point like what like i thought it (57:40 - 57:45)
was doordash was it grubhub whatever oh (57:42 - 57:47)
no there was whatever (57:45 - 57:48)
one of those i'm sure they'll buy each (57:47 - 57:51)
other eventually (57:48 - 57:52)
so their lot their reasoning for (57:51 - 57:55)
changing it back was two things number (57:52 - 57:58)
one it's the the reason that everyone (57:55 - 58:00)
had is well it worked for four years and (57:58 - 58:03)
people played the game (58:00 - 58:03)
and i i i do get it from that aspect of (58:04 - 58:08)
like (58:06 - 58:10)
we want to get back to where that was (58:08 - 58:11)
because that's what the thing that (58:10 - 58:13)
worked but (58:11 - 58:16)
i think we all can agree now that (58:13 - 58:18)
nothing will ever be the same with covid (58:16 - 58:20)
right like there is no (58:18 - 58:22)
well and it there there is there's there (58:20 - 58:25)
is no like definite end date to covey (58:22 - 58:26)
there's no definition right any of it (58:25 - 58:30)
but also it's like saying you all liked (58:26 - 58:32)
hms for seven generations so for (58:30 - 58:35)
generation nine we're going back to hm's (58:32 - 58:38)
because it worked goodness i miss the hm (58:35 - 58:40)
so like it is such (58:38 - 58:41)
it is it is one of those things where (58:40 - 58:43)
i'm like (58:41 - 58:46)
when you make an improvement and people (58:43 - 58:49)
really like it to go back and say well (58:46 - 58:50)
it worked for four years so why don't (58:49 - 58:52)
you like it now it's like because we saw (58:50 - 58:54)
a better world (58:52 - 58:56)
we got a better thing (58:54 - 58:58)
and saying i agree with you guys four (58:56 - 59:01)
years is so infuriating but that's not (58:58 - 59:04)
the one that really makes me mad (59:01 - 59:05)
and and that's what bothered me about (59:04 - 59:07)
omega ruby off of sapphire it's like you (59:05 - 59:08)
introduce character customization you (59:07 - 59:10)
start to get rid of hms and it's like (59:08 - 59:12)
well we did this because that's how the (59:10 - 59:14)
gen 3 was and when you we want you to (59:12 - 59:15)
live through it again and it's like no i (59:14 - 59:16)
don't want to live through that again (59:15 - 59:18)
you you figured it out over the years (59:16 - 59:20)
why are we doing and that's why i was so (59:18 - 59:22)
excited with diamond pearl is like cool (59:20 - 59:23)
you brought back character customization (59:22 - 59:24)
i mean it's not the end of the world (59:23 - 59:26)
it's not the biggest thing (59:24 - 59:28)
we don't know about hm that's good (59:26 - 59:30)
feedback so (59:28 - 59:32)
so (59:30 - 59:34)
to be fair and i will say this i'm not (59:32 - 59:35)
defending niantic i'm just trying to be (59:34 - 59:37)
transparent as possible because niantic (59:35 - 59:39)
is very bad at the transparency i don't (59:37 - 59:40)
know if the people i talked to in the (59:39 - 59:43)
meeting were the actual decision makers (59:40 - 59:44)
right (59:43 - 59:45)
they just gave me their reasons they (59:44 - 59:47)
just talked it out (59:45 - 59:48)
true (59:47 - 59:49)
i can't tell you how many people i (59:48 - 59:51)
talked to or who was in this zoom call (59:49 - 59:52)
but (59:51 - 59:54)
i don't know if the people there were (59:52 - 59:55)
like (59:54 - 59:57)
hey this was our decision or hey we have (59:55 - 59:59)
like 18 bosses that said we had to do it (59:57 - 60:02)
this way i don't know i don't know that (59:59 - 60:03)
but (60:02 - 60:05)
they said okay so here's the actual (60:03 - 60:07)
reason besides the like well it worked (60:05 - 60:08)
for four years (60:07 - 60:10)
let's go back to that the actual reason (60:08 - 60:13)
is they showed us a picture of a (60:10 - 60:16)
pokestop uh on like like somebody at (60:13 - 60:18)
niantic walked to this pokestop they (60:16 - 60:20)
stood 20 meters away i'm going to say 20 (60:18 - 60:22)
meters because remember it's not 40 (60:20 - 60:24)
meters because that's the circumference (60:22 - 60:26)
or whatever it's radius not diameter (60:24 - 60:29)
diameter so they stood 20 minute meters (60:26 - 60:31)
away from this horse stash 2 and then (60:29 - 60:33)
they took a picture of it (60:31 - 60:36)
and then they (60:33 - 60:37)
walked (60:36 - 60:41)
80 me 40 meters away (60:37 - 60:43)
because 80 is the new distance and they (60:41 - 60:45)
took a picture (60:43 - 60:46)
of it down the street (60:45 - 60:48)
they were in like some like small (60:46 - 60:50)
downtown area and you couldn't see the (60:48 - 60:51)
horse stash to you because they were (60:50 - 60:53)
down the street and then they took it (60:51 - 60:55)
from like the east side and you couldn't (60:53 - 60:57)
see the horde statue at all because the (60:55 - 60:58)
lot there was like a library or a (60:57 - 61:00)
building in the way and then they showed (60:58 - 61:02)
another thing so their (61:00 - 61:04)
logic and again this makes sense even (61:02 - 61:05)
though greg disagrees with it their (61:04 - 61:07)
logic is hurry (61:05 - 61:10)
i don't agree with it either but i have (61:07 - 61:11)
a different reason why i don't agree (61:10 - 61:13)
with it than greg does (61:11 - 61:15)
their logic was our (61:13 - 61:18)
our game is you in the real world (61:15 - 61:19)
interacting with (61:18 - 61:21)
pokestops and if you cannot see the (61:19 - 61:24)
pokestop that doesn't really make sense (61:21 - 61:26)
because like you're spinning the horse (61:24 - 61:28)
statue but you can't see the horse (61:26 - 61:31)
statue so that's why the four they (61:28 - 61:32)
that's why they wanted the 40 instead of (61:31 - 61:34)
the 80 because if you can't see the (61:32 - 61:36)
stops they're spinning how are you like (61:34 - 61:39)
interacting with it and we're like okay (61:36 - 61:42)
so what we took away from that is (61:39 - 61:44)
you have a worldwide game you want (61:42 - 61:47)
people to go outside we get that (61:44 - 61:50)
and so your distance was based off can i (61:47 - 61:53)
see the object i'm spinning (61:50 - 61:55)
and yeah if you're 80 there could be a (61:53 - 61:56)
building between you and the thing so (61:55 - 61:58)
you don't know exactly what you're (61:56 - 61:59)
spending (61:58 - 62:01)
based off of that i have been in (61:59 - 62:04)
corporations for 25 years and i can (62:01 - 62:06)
smell (62:04 - 62:09)
we need to justify this decision line (62:06 - 62:11)
and that's what that is (62:09 - 62:14)
because in my own hometown i can show (62:11 - 62:16)
you monuments that i can see from an 80 (62:14 - 62:19)
meter distance clear as day and i can (62:16 - 62:21)
show you monuments that you cannot see (62:19 - 62:24)
until you're on top of it and what that (62:21 - 62:27)
is and what infuriates me about it is (62:24 - 62:29)
there is no way they went to every (62:27 - 62:32)
monument in the entire world and said (62:29 - 62:34)
the average is 40 meters they had to (62:32 - 62:37)
make a decision they made it at 40 and (62:34 - 62:40)
said okay here's our justification for (62:37 - 62:42)
it which is not a great justification (62:40 - 62:44)
because of two things (62:42 - 62:45)
one (62:44 - 62:47)
there are plenty of examples where you (62:45 - 62:50)
can see it and you can't and two (62:47 - 62:53)
it's not a barrier it's not like i run (62:50 - 62:55)
into a force field at 40 meters and (62:53 - 62:58)
can't get any closer if i want to (62:55 - 63:01)
interact with that item guess what i can (62:58 - 63:04)
make the choice to get closer and see it (63:01 - 63:06)
you know what i don't need i don't need (63:04 - 63:07)
to get closer to the buddhist temple (63:06 - 63:10)
that i have passed by (63:07 - 63:12)
that's one block from my house that i (63:10 - 63:15)
have passed every day for five years (63:12 - 63:17)
that this game has been out i don't need (63:15 - 63:20)
to explore it at 40 meters anymore i've (63:17 - 63:22)
seen it what am i seeing that's new (63:20 - 63:25)
nothing we are five years into this game (63:22 - 63:26)
people (63:25 - 63:28)
all will explore when they're out in the (63:26 - 63:31)
world looking for new things (63:28 - 63:33)
the reason that oh it's 40 minutes and (63:31 - 63:35)
that's the ideal thing is (63:33 - 63:38)
false and easily disproven two (63:35 - 63:41)
i get to make the choice i get to get (63:38 - 63:43)
closer if i want to so how about which (63:41 - 63:45)
is what we've complained about all the (63:43 - 63:46)
time (63:45 - 63:49)
incentivize me to get closer (63:46 - 63:51)
make it so that i get one set of rewards (63:49 - 63:54)
at 80 meter and one a different set of (63:51 - 63:56)
words at 40 and maybe a different set of (63:54 - 63:58)
rewards when i'm closer and actually (63:56 - 64:01)
interacting with it like (63:58 - 64:03)
like i understand five years ago you had (64:01 - 64:05)
to make a choice (64:03 - 64:06)
but (64:05 - 64:08)
that choice doesn't it's five years (64:06 - 64:11)
later people are in their hometown you (64:08 - 64:14)
actually have to run research to get (64:11 - 64:17)
people to go out and find new locales (64:14 - 64:18)
because we haven't been able to travel (64:17 - 64:21)
for two years (64:18 - 64:21)
people who have probably explored all of (64:21 - 64:24)
their city (64:23 - 64:26)
multiple times in the five years that (64:24 - 64:28)
they played this game (64:26 - 64:31)
it is such an it is such a limiting idea (64:28 - 64:34)
and what it is it is a thing that i run (64:31 - 64:36)
into corporations all the time it's why (64:34 - 64:38)
it enrages me because it's like (64:36 - 64:39)
we had to make a decision this is the (64:38 - 64:41)
decision we've made and we've never (64:39 - 64:43)
thought about it again yeah (64:41 - 64:46)
and it's it's infuriating (64:43 - 64:49)
because again i can get closer i can get (64:46 - 64:51)
if if something i've never seen before (64:49 - 64:54)
and i can't see it at the 80 meter (64:51 - 64:55)
distance (64:54 - 64:58)
i get to walk closer and find it (64:55 - 65:00)
what also happens is sometimes they're (64:58 - 65:02)
in locked buildings and i can't get in (65:00 - 65:05)
there because it's locked yeah (65:02 - 65:07)
i you need to report that pokey stop and (65:05 - 65:09)
have them remove it (65:07 - 65:11)
what if they'd what if they came back (65:09 - 65:12)
and they said no we've actually done (65:11 - 65:15)
scientific research and discovered that (65:12 - 65:18)
40 meters is the tipping point where if (65:15 - 65:20)
we set it at 40 meters then the majority (65:18 - 65:22)
of people will go and investigate and (65:20 - 65:24)
look at the thing that is the pokestop (65:22 - 65:29)
be transparent with your studies i (65:24 - 65:29)
i will say that like i see where they're (65:32 - 65:37)
coming from in the sense of i have (65:35 - 65:40)
explored new areas of milwaukee because (65:37 - 65:42)
of this game (65:40 - 65:44)
so like i have never walked down the (65:42 - 65:45)
street or i didn't know this building (65:44 - 65:47)
was here and that is purely because of (65:45 - 65:50)
pokemon go so like the logic of like (65:47 - 65:52)
well you know you can see it here you (65:50 - 65:53)
can't see it here this is why we agreed (65:52 - 65:56)
on the distance (65:53 - 65:56)
this is what i told them and i think (65:57 - 66:02)
greg and i kind of shared the same (66:00 - 66:05)
thought here is i said to them i don't (66:02 - 66:09)
care if it's 40 or 80. (66:05 - 66:09)
i want to be rewarded for exploring and (66:10 - 66:15)
i don't feel like i am getting rewarded (66:13 - 66:18)
for exploring if i can sit on my couch (66:15 - 66:20)
and spin two poke stops and and pop an (66:18 - 66:22)
incense (66:20 - 66:24)
and catch a bunch of pokemon and remote (66:22 - 66:27)
into 14 raids this week and not leave my (66:24 - 66:28)
house (66:27 - 66:30)
why would i (66:28 - 66:33)
if you want people if if the core of (66:30 - 66:35)
your game is walking and getting people (66:33 - 66:37)
to go out (66:35 - 66:39)
why do i feel like i am not getting (66:37 - 66:42)
anything more than the people sitting on (66:39 - 66:43)
their couch (66:42 - 66:45)
so like to me it doesn't matter if it's (66:43 - 66:47)
40 or if it's 80 or if it's 20 if your (66:45 - 66:49)
game is rewarding me for going out and (66:47 - 66:52)
exploring i will go to that pokestop and (66:49 - 66:54)
i will walk past it and i will then keep (66:52 - 66:58)
walking because i want the rewards (66:54 - 66:59)
you're giving me (66:58 - 67:01)
um (66:59 - 67:03)
and they were took down the notes and (67:01 - 67:07)
everything i will say (67:03 - 67:07)
yeah i will say that like (67:07 - 67:10)
there are other content creators in that (67:09 - 67:11)
meeting (67:10 - 67:13)
and the thing that kind of stood out to (67:11 - 67:15)
me is a couple of them said like no one (67:13 - 67:18)
leaves or goes out because of pokestops (67:15 - 67:20)
so just make it 80. and i thought that (67:18 - 67:23)
was kind of weird because i feel like (67:20 - 67:25)
sometimes hardcore players get in this (67:23 - 67:27)
mindset of like (67:25 - 67:29)
well i've explored my city a million (67:27 - 67:30)
times and i don't care about the horse (67:29 - 67:32)
statue down the street at pf chang's (67:30 - 67:34)
it's like yeah i mean i get it you don't (67:32 - 67:37)
care because you live there but (67:34 - 67:40)
the reason i have explored is literally (67:37 - 67:42)
because that pokestop has a ring that (67:40 - 67:44)
i've never been to and so i'm going to (67:42 - 67:47)
walk to it because i want to because i (67:44 - 67:48)
know i haven't been there because the (67:47 - 67:51)
ring is there and i want the experience (67:48 - 67:54)
and i would assume that these like heart (67:51 - 67:56)
maybe maybe the ones i don't wanna i'm (67:54 - 67:57)
not gonna say who they were maybe they (67:56 - 67:59)
were battle heavy people so they don't (67:57 - 68:01)
care that much about exploring or (67:59 - 68:02)
catching (68:01 - 68:04)
and they only explore they only care (68:02 - 68:06)
about gbl or raids (68:04 - 68:07)
but (68:06 - 68:08)
i would (68:07 - 68:11)
i disagreed with i mean i didn't like (68:08 - 68:13)
like unmute my like self on the call and (68:11 - 68:14)
there's a lot of people in the call but (68:13 - 68:16)
i was like (68:14 - 68:18)
but poke stops are why i explore i mean (68:16 - 68:20)
like if i've never been to it i'm going (68:18 - 68:21)
to go to like it's a reason for me to (68:20 - 68:23)
walk to it (68:21 - 68:25)
here's the here's the reality i don't (68:23 - 68:27)
know a spot (68:25 - 68:29)
in minnesota unless somebody submits (68:27 - 68:31)
something new (68:29 - 68:33)
that has something new that i don't have (68:31 - 68:35)
to travel (68:33 - 68:37)
half an hour to 45 minutes outside of (68:35 - 68:39)
the city for (68:37 - 68:41)
there is nothing in (68:39 - 68:44)
minneapolis my neighborhood (68:41 - 68:47)
the campus (68:44 - 68:48)
uptown (68:47 - 68:50)
that i have not (68:48 - 68:54)
visited in the last five years (68:50 - 68:56)
and so the hunt for something new means (68:54 - 68:59)
i have to specifically say i am going to (68:56 - 69:00)
go to (68:59 - 69:03)
a completely different area (69:00 - 69:05)
and now try to find stuff (69:03 - 69:07)
that i haven't been to and if it's (69:05 - 69:09)
anywhere between minneapolis and the (69:07 - 69:11)
mall of america i've seen it i've spun (69:09 - 69:14)
it i've done it i've walked around it (69:11 - 69:16)
it's been five years of your game being (69:14 - 69:16)
out (69:16 - 69:19)
yeah unless i travel to milwaukee which (69:16 - 69:21)
i've done that i did it on your wedding (69:19 - 69:23)
i hit a bunch of stuff like you can show (69:21 - 69:25)
me places i've never been to but that is (69:23 - 69:27)
a trip i'm making (69:25 - 69:29)
yeah still it doesn't alter the fact (69:27 - 69:30)
that (69:29 - 69:33)
the 80 meter distance (69:30 - 69:35)
is not preventative (69:33 - 69:37)
it doesn't stop me from getting closer (69:35 - 69:39)
to the stop (69:37 - 69:41)
encourage me to get closer to the top (69:39 - 69:43)
right give me better rewards for getting (69:41 - 69:44)
closer to the stop (69:43 - 69:48)
let me and your player base make choices (69:44 - 69:52)
based off of their own safety and what (69:48 - 69:53)
they feel (69:52 - 69:55)
and reward people who play the game the (69:53 - 69:59)
way you want what angers me about a lot (69:55 - 70:00)
of companies and a lot of gaming (69:59 - 70:03)
companies do this is they hard focus on (70:00 - 70:04)
how (70:03 - 70:06)
they absolutely feel the games should be (70:04 - 70:09)
played and won't budge off of it even if (70:06 - 70:10)
it's been (70:09 - 70:13)
15 20 years like no well i mean that's (70:10 - 70:16)
the way it is yes that is that is (70:13 - 70:16)
probably (70:16 - 70:18)
a (70:16 - 70:21)
roadblock or obstacle that game (70:18 - 70:22)
designers (70:21 - 70:24)
you have to be able to self-identify of (70:22 - 70:27)
like yes that's how you want the game to (70:24 - 70:30)
be played but you actually have to look (70:27 - 70:32)
at how people are actually playing the (70:30 - 70:33)
game (70:32 - 70:34)
and adapt (70:33 - 70:37)
i bet i will agree with you well i think (70:34 - 70:40)
the big takeaway from the meeting (70:37 - 70:42)
is like number one (70:40 - 70:45)
if you're going to make choices (70:42 - 70:47)
if you're going to make choices you have (70:45 - 70:50)
to be more transparent so people don't (70:47 - 70:52)
the the lack of transparency is why (70:50 - 70:54)
people speculate oh this is only about (70:52 - 70:56)
money or oh like niantic only wants a (70:54 - 70:58)
dollar (70:56 - 70:59)
with transparency though is then you (70:58 - 71:02)
give people a reason like to (70:59 - 71:04)
self-justify to why they're leaving if (71:02 - 71:07)
you leave it ambiguous and they can say (71:04 - 71:09)
i'm gonna stay because i think i'm angry (71:07 - 71:11)
about this but since i'm not sure that's (71:09 - 71:13)
what i'm angry about i'll stay but if (71:11 - 71:15)
they specifically like give you a reason (71:13 - 71:16)
and you're like oh that is the reason (71:15 - 71:19)
why i'm angry then i'm out and they go (71:16 - 71:23)
but the the other thing that i felt like (71:19 - 71:26)
this meeting was (71:23 - 71:26)
was (71:26 - 71:29)
you you have you haven't even looked (71:26 - 71:32)
your game was the same not the same but (71:29 - 71:34)
a lot of things (71:32 - 71:36)
in pogo for the last five years were (71:34 - 71:39)
decisions made on like the first year of (71:36 - 71:43)
the game like adventure sync (71:39 - 71:43)
adventure sync (71:44 - 71:48)
like and i i did say this during this (71:46 - 71:50)
was part two of what i said i only spoke (71:48 - 71:52)
for like i mean it was an hour meeting i (71:50 - 71:55)
only spoke for like two minutes because (71:52 - 71:56)
the third takeaway i had from the (71:55 - 71:58)
niantic meeting is people say a lot in a (71:56 - 72:01)
zoom call and they they say very little (71:58 - 72:03)
yeah they talk a lot (72:01 - 72:06)
i use a lot of words to say very little (72:03 - 72:08)
yes and it's like wow you just wasted 10 (72:06 - 72:10)
minutes of this meeting and you could (72:08 - 72:12)
have said one sentence ah so the second (72:10 - 72:14)
thing i said is (72:12 - 72:15)
i feel like i'm a hardcore player in (72:14 - 72:18)
pokemon go (72:15 - 72:18)
i have only hit the 50 (72:18 - 72:23)
in the last five years (72:22 - 72:26)
maybe a dozen times (72:23 - 72:28)
how many weeks in a year 52 (72:26 - 72:31)
um it's every week so 12 out of you know (72:28 - 72:34)
200 weeks you are doing wrong or what am (72:31 - 72:37)
i doing that's so extraordinary you walk (72:34 - 72:39)
a lot i've started walking you i've been (72:37 - 72:42)
doing my daily constitutionals so i'm (72:39 - 72:43)
i'm getting closer to hitting those (72:42 - 72:46)
parts but yeah you walk a lot i see it i (72:43 - 72:49)
would say that i probably (72:46 - 72:53)
hit like 35 a week so i get the 25 (72:49 - 72:55)
reward which is (72:53 - 72:57)
who no one cares no one cares about the (72:55 - 73:00)
egg with cranidos in it (72:57 - 73:01)
and there's nothing in that game that's (73:00 - 73:05)
driving me to walk to get the 50 (73:01 - 73:06)
ever (73:05 - 73:08)
and when i did hit the 50 it just (73:06 - 73:09)
reminds me of how much of a (73:08 - 73:11)
disappointment it is (73:09 - 73:14)
to get it like again if you want your (73:11 - 73:16)
game like they've said this again and (73:14 - 73:18)
you know people are mad about like go (73:16 - 73:20)
fest of like one of the tasks was you (73:18 - 73:22)
know walk one kilometer their game is (73:20 - 73:24)
about walking i'm sorry that they've (73:22 - 73:26)
said it we've we've said it that's what (73:24 - 73:28)
it is if you want to play on the couch (73:26 - 73:31)
and not ever leave your house you (73:28 - 73:34)
can but their game is about walking and (73:31 - 73:35)
they've made it pretty clear over the (73:34 - 73:37)
last five years that look that's what (73:35 - 73:40)
you're signing up for i mean i i i do (73:37 - 73:43)
think that it is unfair to say that some (73:40 - 73:44)
of the people who are complaining about (73:43 - 73:45)
the walking requirements (73:44 - 73:48)
are just wanting to sit on the couch (73:45 - 73:49)
sure there's a number of people who (73:48 - 73:51)
cannot complete that task (73:49 - 73:53)
they just can't for mobility reasons for (73:51 - 73:55)
a ton of reasons (73:53 - 73:57)
so let's be real some of the people who (73:55 - 73:59)
are upset is (73:57 - 74:02)
legitimate this is an impossible task (73:59 - 74:05)
for me and you made it a vital part of (74:02 - 74:07)
this it wasn't optional i get why (74:05 - 74:10)
they're mad it's easy to say oh they (74:07 - 74:12)
just want to sit on the couch there's a (74:10 - 74:13)
whole section of people who want to play (74:12 - 74:16)
this game that cannot do those things (74:13 - 74:18)
they need to remember that that (74:16 - 74:21)
it's a game about walking it's also a (74:18 - 74:23)
pokemon game and there's a lot of people (74:21 - 74:25)
that can't necessarily do those walking (74:23 - 74:27)
things easy and that does need to be on (74:25 - 74:29)
their radar (74:27 - 74:31)
and a lot of those people started (74:29 - 74:33)
playing because of (74:31 - 74:36)
the covid changes correct (74:33 - 74:40)
totally understand (74:36 - 74:40)
was that oh yeah we were talking about (74:42 - 74:44)
the so (74:43 - 74:47)
the (74:44 - 74:47)
the (74:47 - 74:49)
i think the word somebody else used in (74:50 - 74:54)
the meeting was the game needs to be (74:52 - 74:56)
more additive (74:54 - 74:58)
to i agree (74:56 - 74:59)
uh versus (74:58 - 75:01)
like what they did was like remove (74:59 - 75:03)
features pretty much for everyone (75:01 - 75:04)
um (75:03 - 75:06)
so that whoever said that the game needs (75:04 - 75:08)
to be more additive (75:06 - 75:10)
million percent agree with you also i (75:08 - 75:11)
said a lot of words and i really said (75:10 - 75:13)
nothing but really i could have just (75:11 - 75:15)
said hey make your game more additive (75:13 - 75:18)
there we go we're here well i mean it's (75:15 - 75:19)
it's helpful to give (75:18 - 75:21)
concrete (75:19 - 75:24)
ideas of what you think that should be (75:21 - 75:26)
right like it's one thing to say hey (75:24 - 75:27)
make it more additive but be able to say (75:26 - 75:29)
like hey when i mean additive i want (75:27 - 75:31)
rewards to happen at certain things that (75:29 - 75:34)
reward me for these behaviors (75:31 - 75:37)
it's good to be clear or understand one (75:34 - 75:39)
of the key rules of customer service of (75:37 - 75:41)
once you start giving something away you (75:39 - 75:43)
can't take it back (75:41 - 75:45)
and also i i do want to i like i'm not (75:43 - 75:47)
trying to throw anyone under the bus but (75:45 - 75:48)
there were people in that meeting other (75:47 - 75:51)
content creators and whatnot making (75:48 - 75:53)
like saying things about their (75:51 - 75:55)
communities and what they do that i just (75:53 - 75:56)
disagree with like the whole pokestop (75:55 - 75:57)
thing of like no one cares about (75:56 - 75:59)
pokestops just make it 80 no one's going (75:57 - 76:01)
to poke stops because they want to see a (75:59 - 76:02)
horse statue (76:01 - 76:03)
i (76:02 - 76:04)
fundamentally (76:03 - 76:07)
i just disagree with that i mean i i i (76:04 - 76:10)
me as an individual i enjoy looking at (76:07 - 76:12)
the poke stops especially like when i'm (76:10 - 76:14)
sending gifts out to people and i see (76:12 - 76:16)
like the pokestops that they're sending (76:14 - 76:18)
me and the ones that i'm sending out to (76:16 - 76:19)
them and i'm like oh i don't remember (76:18 - 76:22)
passing that like when i went to the art (76:19 - 76:25)
park with you guys and before i met you (76:22 - 76:27)
guys that's how i explore i was like oh (76:25 - 76:30)
i i'm we're walking to the spaceship (76:27 - 76:33)
that's cool okay what's this what's this (76:30 - 76:34)
over here okay we're walking to the (76:33 - 76:37)
gnome under the tree like that is how i (76:34 - 76:39)
explored that park and it was a great (76:37 - 76:40)
way (76:39 - 76:43)
to explore that park (76:40 - 76:44)
um (76:43 - 76:46)
so i guess like that that leads into (76:44 - 76:47)
like (76:46 - 76:50)
i can kind of see why (76:47 - 76:52)
companies in general don't listen to (76:50 - 76:55)
their fan bases even though their fan (76:52 - 76:57)
bases are vocal because literally in (76:55 - 76:59)
this meeting (76:57 - 77:01)
some people just (76:59 - 77:02)
were like no one does this and i'm (77:01 - 77:05)
sitting here being like no people do do (77:02 - 77:07)
this like don't listen (77:05 - 77:11)
unmute my mic don't listen to that guy (77:07 - 77:11)
it is always a balancing act of what (77:12 - 77:19)
what feedback is (77:17 - 77:24)
is good and what feedback is bad and (77:19 - 77:24)
it is always hard to determine what (77:24 - 77:29)
percentage that person (77:26 - 77:32)
represents but generally if more than (77:29 - 77:34)
one person agrees with it there is a (77:32 - 77:36)
larger segment of your customer base (77:34 - 77:39)
that also feels that way and should be (77:36 - 77:40)
considered (77:39 - 77:43)
and when you have conflicting (77:40 - 77:45)
information then yeah you need to make a (77:43 - 77:47)
decision about how you think the game (77:45 - 77:49)
should be played (77:47 - 77:50)
but (77:49 - 77:52)
overall like (77:50 - 77:54)
one of the things is i don't think ever (77:52 - 77:57)
anybody disagreed with like the (77:54 - 77:59)
extended stop distance was good for (77:57 - 78:01)
everybody and yeah real mad when it went (77:59 - 78:04)
away like that's a clear message how you (78:01 - 78:05)
solve for x (78:04 - 78:08)
can be open for interpretation but (78:05 - 78:11)
yeah there's a ton of people who (78:08 - 78:13)
can't afford to travel have visited (78:11 - 78:15)
everything in their house a new pokestop (78:13 - 78:18)
is not you know going to see pokestops (78:15 - 78:19)
that they've seen a thousand times is (78:18 - 78:21)
not a draw for them to to go into that (78:19 - 78:23)
area again totally (78:21 - 78:24)
and there are people who have one (78:23 - 78:25)
pokestop in their town and they've (78:24 - 78:27)
always had one pokestop in their town so (78:25 - 78:29)
yeah i get it for that person in that (78:27 - 78:31)
town with one pokestop that pokestop (78:29 - 78:33)
probably not a drawdown thank you yeah (78:31 - 78:35)
really very well aware of what it is (78:33 - 78:37)
yeah they've probably been doing a lot i (78:35 - 78:39)
probably put it there (78:37 - 78:42)
uh so i i mean niantic apologized to us (78:39 - 78:44)
they they said like (78:42 - 78:46)
we made the decision to go back (78:44 - 78:48)
we learned that it was the wrong (78:46 - 78:50)
decision (78:48 - 78:51)
and we spent (78:50 - 78:53)
however long they spent like what three (78:51 - 78:55)
weeks talking about (78:53 - 78:56)
what was the right decision which i (78:55 - 78:58)
don't know like i mean in retrospect the (78:56 - 78:59)
right decision is like we'll just (78:58 - 79:01)
reverse it but i'm sure they were (78:59 - 79:03)
talking about like do we make it 60 do (79:01 - 79:05)
we make it 70 do we do only gyms do we (79:03 - 79:08)
only do stops do we do a hundred i'm (79:05 - 79:09)
sure that was all talked about and it (79:08 - 79:10)
probably just (79:09 - 79:13)
as easy as it was to say well it worked (79:10 - 79:14)
for four years let's go back to it it (79:13 - 79:16)
was probably easy to say we'll just go (79:14 - 79:19)
back to 80. yes well but also you know (79:16 - 79:22)
at least give niantic some (79:19 - 79:24)
acknowledgement and gratitude that they (79:22 - 79:26)
are willing to reflect on the question (79:24 - 79:28)
and make changes even if we don't like (79:26 - 79:30)
the first decision even if we don't like (79:28 - 79:31)
the change that they make at least (79:30 - 79:33)
they're willing to do so look i just (79:31 - 79:36)
went back to destiny 2 and some like (79:33 - 79:38)
thanks for telling me i heard that i (79:36 - 79:39)
heard that and you didn't invite me i (79:38 - 79:42)
heard that so literally these are dumb (79:39 - 79:44)
decisions but i (79:42 - 79:46)
they were really little things but my (79:44 - 79:48)
favorite class was the gunslinger class (79:46 - 79:50)
in destiny and in destiny 1 (79:48 - 79:53)
your your golden gun lasted like eight (79:50 - 79:55)
seconds and your trip mines stuck to (79:53 - 79:57)
enemies and to other players so in like (79:55 - 79:59)
crucible that was really good and in (79:57 - 80:01)
destiny 2 they were like trip mines no (79:59 - 80:02)
longer stick (80:01 - 80:04)
golden gun no longer lasts eight seconds (80:02 - 80:06)
you got like 2.5 seconds good luck you (80:04 - 80:08)
better have a good aim and those two (80:06 - 80:09)
changes (80:08 - 80:11)
were enough to be like i am no longer (80:09 - 80:13)
having fun with destiny yeah (80:11 - 80:15)
there were obviously other reasons and (80:13 - 80:17)
for a lot of pokemon go players it's (80:15 - 80:19)
just not this it's just not the radius (80:17 - 80:22)
it's the radius plus this and plus this (80:19 - 80:23)
and plus this (80:22 - 80:25)
and just i went back to destiny 2 this (80:23 - 80:27)
week after my wife was like please i (80:25 - 80:29)
want to try destiny again (80:27 - 80:29)
and (80:29 - 80:31)
five years later (80:29 - 80:33)
my golden gun is normal they they went (80:31 - 80:34)
back (80:33 - 80:37)
it took them five years they did they (80:34 - 80:39)
fixed the trip mine trip mine now sticks (80:37 - 80:42)
to enemies again so like (80:39 - 80:44)
if anything hey diantic only took three (80:42 - 80:47)
weeks bungie took five years to make (80:44 - 80:49)
these changes (80:47 - 80:50)
so (80:49 - 80:51)
i have had plenty of meetings with (80:50 - 80:53)
niantic (80:51 - 80:54)
they always (80:53 - 80:57)
and the people that i talk to (80:54 - 81:01)
i always leave those meetings optimistic (80:57 - 81:02)
like (81:01 - 81:04)
i don't know if it's the pokemon company (81:02 - 81:06)
i don't know if it's google i don't know (81:04 - 81:08)
if it's nintendo i don't know if it's (81:06 - 81:10)
like one specific boss that works at (81:08 - 81:12)
niantic but the people i talk to they (81:10 - 81:14)
they love the game so much they're so (81:12 - 81:16)
optimistic about it they're so excited (81:14 - 81:18)
with these changes that are rolling out (81:16 - 81:20)
they want to get our feedback of what we (81:18 - 81:22)
think about things that they are working (81:20 - 81:24)
on and (81:22 - 81:26)
i don't have any like super big secrets (81:24 - 81:28)
like i found out like even in the (81:26 - 81:29)
meeting with niantic about the change (81:28 - 81:31)
like they when (81:29 - 81:32)
i left that meeting they didn't say they (81:31 - 81:34)
were gonna they said they were gonna (81:32 - 81:35)
change it but they didn't give us a date (81:34 - 81:37)
they were like we regret the we regret (81:35 - 81:38)
the 40 (81:37 - 81:39)
we're going to change it we don't know (81:38 - 81:40)
what we're going to change it to we (81:39 - 81:42)
don't know when and then lo and behold (81:40 - 81:44)
like two days later they changed it (81:42 - 81:45)
um (81:44 - 81:47)
and there's another change on september (81:45 - 81:49)
1st so i don't know what that is (81:47 - 81:52)
um but hopefully it's something good (81:49 - 81:54)
all in all (81:52 - 81:55)
i'm going to tell you as an employee of (81:54 - 81:56)
another company (81:55 - 81:58)
i can definitely muster up excitement (81:56 - 82:00)
when i'm talking about my own company (81:58 - 82:02)
that i don't really feel (82:00 - 82:04)
yep (82:02 - 82:04)
but (82:05 - 82:07)
i love pokemon go i want pokemon go to (82:08 - 82:13)
be the best game there is (82:11 - 82:14)
i hope that whatever they say on (82:13 - 82:17)
september 1st is like (82:14 - 82:19)
hey we're fixing (82:17 - 82:21)
avengers sync we want to make it more (82:19 - 82:22)
fun (82:21 - 82:24)
like (82:22 - 82:27)
i i just hope that this (82:24 - 82:31)
40 and 80 debate or problem or issue or (82:27 - 82:34)
mistake whatever you want to classify it (82:31 - 82:37)
i i kind of am glad that it happened (82:34 - 82:39)
because (82:37 - 82:41)
i think everyone whether it's a company (82:39 - 82:44)
or just a person they like need a (82:41 - 82:46)
sometimes they need something tragic to (82:44 - 82:48)
be like we should really reflect on this (82:46 - 82:50)
or the things that we the things that we (82:48 - 82:53)
just took for granted for four years we (82:50 - 82:54)
should actually look at them and say (82:53 - 82:56)
like hey the world is different the game (82:54 - 82:58)
is different our players are different (82:56 - 83:00)
and we should change them (82:58 - 83:02)
one would tragic maybe not the best word (83:00 - 83:04)
a global pandemic (83:02 - 83:07)
would have brought about these decisions (83:04 - 83:09)
and it did (83:07 - 83:12)
what's what the sign of a very (83:09 - 83:14)
mid-sized company is (83:12 - 83:17)
you don't have a lot of voices in those (83:14 - 83:19)
meetings and i think that shows in a lot (83:17 - 83:21)
of their decisions is (83:19 - 83:22)
you're (83:21 - 83:25)
i think niantic still has a we're a tiny (83:22 - 83:28)
company trying to do good (83:25 - 83:30)
and hasn't wrestled with the fact that (83:28 - 83:33)
you're a very large company that a lot (83:30 - 83:35)
of people are watching now you may not (83:33 - 83:37)
have a lot of employees but you're (83:35 - 83:39)
playing with the big boys (83:37 - 83:40)
and (83:39 - 83:43)
you are no longer able to be like oops (83:40 - 83:45)
we're just little people we didn't think (83:43 - 83:47)
about it like you have to get on board (83:45 - 83:48)
with what (83:47 - 83:50)
millions of other companies that do (83:48 - 83:52)
vital services or that a lot of people (83:50 - 83:54)
are into is you really have to be in (83:52 - 83:56)
touch with your customer base you have (83:54 - 83:58)
to get better communication (83:56 - 84:01)
you have to understand that you can't (83:58 - 84:03)
see yourself as this little underdog (84:01 - 84:05)
anymore when you're making (84:03 - 84:09)
2.5 million dollars a month (84:05 - 84:12)
a lot of money (84:09 - 84:12)
yeah i i (84:12 - 84:18)
i i agree (84:15 - 84:18)
when pokemon go is good it's really good (84:18 - 84:24)
i i agree with that for as much as the (84:22 - 84:27)
game frustrates me when we're having fun (84:24 - 84:29)
i love it (84:27 - 84:31)
and that (84:29 - 84:31)
or when i'm just walking through my (84:31 - 84:35)
neighborhood and suddenly i can't get to (84:33 - 84:38)
a gym like nah i'm pretty mad at you (84:35 - 84:41)
right now yeah it's i mean and it's (84:38 - 84:43)
i think it's it's easier to be (84:41 - 84:45)
frustrated with it because it's on your (84:43 - 84:47)
phone and you're in the real world and (84:45 - 84:50)
you can just swipe it close and move on (84:47 - 84:51)
versus sitting on your couch or in front (84:50 - 84:53)
of your hand (84:51 - 84:55)
if your gps was better and didn't shoot (84:53 - 84:57)
me all over the city (84:55 - 84:59)
giving me extra distance and maybe get (84:57 - 85:01)
there would be help (84:59 - 85:03)
uh yeah i don't have anything else i (85:01 - 85:06)
mean like uh i i thought niantic was (85:03 - 85:08)
pretty transparent i think the the when (85:06 - 85:10)
they told us their thought process i was (85:08 - 85:11)
like this makes sense even though i (85:10 - 85:13)
don't agree with you but at least (85:11 - 85:16)
at least your company is (85:13 - 85:16)
your company is doing something um (85:16 - 85:21)
they're trying yes (85:19 - 85:23)
but uh (85:21 - 85:24)
yeah we'll see what the september first (85:23 - 85:27)
stuff is i hope i i hope it's more i i (85:24 - 85:28)
hope it's exciting i hope it's like hey (85:27 - 85:30)
we're fixing (85:28 - 85:31)
xyz (85:30 - 85:33)
we're putting they're bringing that (85:31 - 85:36)
pokemon z finally yes (85:33 - 85:38)
niantic is the lead developer pokemon z (85:36 - 85:40)
for the nintendo switch (85:38 - 85:41)
that's what they've been working on for (85:40 - 85:42)
five years all right we'll take a break (85:41 - 85:43)
we're going to talk about pokemon (85:42 - 85:46)
masters on the uh when we get back and (85:43 - 85:47)
then question the week pokemon in the (85:46 - 85:49)
week so we will be (85:47 - 85:53)
all right back (85:49 - 85:53)
oh they're here what is happening did (85:55 - 85:58)

event has new sync pairs and more so we (86:20 - 86:23)
were talking (86:22 - 86:25)
two weeks ago about what could they (86:23 - 86:29)
possibly do that would be better than (86:25 - 86:30)
leon (86:29 - 86:33)
and the answer was nothing nah these are (86:30 - 86:35)
good (86:33 - 86:36)
they're great (86:35 - 86:39)
they're very good but literally (86:36 - 86:41)
none of these blow (86:39 - 86:43)
leon out of the water leon (86:41 - 86:45)
leon in that sigma suit is the greatest (86:43 - 86:47)
thing that they have put into that game (86:45 - 86:49)
these are good but they do not reach (86:47 - 86:51)
that bar i think the internet would (86:49 - 86:53)
disagree with you on lily they are yes (86:51 - 86:56)
yeah i am not interested in lilly let's (86:53 - 86:59)
be clear i have made that very clear on (86:56 - 87:02)

you're new to the game (89:20 - 89:25)
so new sync pairs uh a trio news sim (89:22 - 89:26)
card is making their debut from august (89:25 - 89:29)
27 through september 29th three pokemon (89:26 - 89:31)
trainers in these sink pairs are (89:29 - 89:32)
returning characters sporting cool (89:31 - 89:35)
anniversary outfits each one is paired (89:32 - 89:36)
with a new legendary partner (89:35 - 89:40)
um so you have lilly anniversary 2021 (89:36 - 89:43)
with lunala and anniversary 2021 with (89:40 - 89:45)
resharam and steven anniversary 2021 (89:43 - 89:47)
with rayquaza (89:45 - 89:49)
for what it's worth (89:47 - 89:52)
the rayquaza is shiny yeah shiny raymond (89:49 - 89:56)
quasar is here with his pal stephen (89:52 - 89:57)
uh want to add even more sync pairs to (89:56 - 89:59)
your squad from september 29th (89:57 - 90:03)
uh until september 29th so literally a (89:59 - 90:05)
whole month you can log into pokemon (90:03 - 90:08)
masters ex for 10 days to (90:05 - 90:10)
receive 10 (90:08 - 90:12)
pair scout tickets each day these (90:10 - 90:14)
tickets will let you uh (90:12 - 90:16)
be used in the special 10 pair scout (90:14 - 90:17)
which can be found in the ticket scout (90:16 - 90:20)
within the shop as you might expect 10 (90:17 - 90:23)
pair scout tickets will allow you to (90:20 - 90:25)
scout 10 sink pairs (90:23 - 90:27)
which means you can team up with a (90:25 - 90:30)
hundred sink pairs totally for free this (90:27 - 90:32)
was the big thing they showed during the (90:30 - 90:35)
pokemon presents um (90:32 - 90:36)
yeah and it is free there is no cash it (90:35 - 90:37)
is free (90:36 - 90:40)
uh i think it's bold of them with as (90:37 - 90:41)
many repeats as they give to so you'll (90:40 - 90:43)
be able to team up with a hundred sink (90:41 - 90:45)
pairs you will probably cheat up with 50 (90:43 - 90:47)
because you get a lot of repeats (90:45 - 90:51)
it's too to be fair not trying to defend (90:47 - 90:54)
but if you're a new player to the game (90:51 - 90:55)
you kind of want those duplicates to (90:54 - 90:57)
make sure they're five out of five oh (90:55 - 90:59)
yeah but but i think it's both of them (90:57 - 91:00)
to say (90:59 - 91:03)
you can team up with a hundred sig pairs (91:00 - 91:06)
nah doc you're not it's gonna be like 50 (91:03 - 91:09)
ramos like that's like ramos and 20 (91:06 - 91:11)
bryson men and then you'll get one five (91:09 - 91:12)
stars so (91:11 - 91:13)
good luck (91:12 - 91:15)
uh (91:13 - 91:17)
yeah i mean (91:15 - 91:19)
you have a seven percent chance of every (91:17 - 91:20)
ten pole to get a five star you get to (91:19 - 91:23)
do it ten times i did see a bunch of (91:20 - 91:25)
people in our discord and our slack say (91:23 - 91:28)
like this is this was what got them to (91:25 - 91:30)

marketing it's a very good deal uh it's (91:30 - 91:36)
it's you you're getting your 100 sync (91:33 - 91:37)
pairs for free (91:36 - 91:39)

gems for logging in uh they had a (91:41 - 91:48)
3 000 bonus for the two year anniversary (91:45 - 91:50)

will give you gems (92:08 - 92:11)
so again (92:10 - 92:13)
if you're a new player it's really hard (92:11 - 92:16)
to be bitter (92:13 - 92:16)
i'm sure the bitterness will come when (92:16 - 92:20)
you pull nothing good yeah but yes it (92:18 - 92:22)
will uh they're (92:20 - 92:23)
they're really (92:22 - 92:26)
rewarding both (92:23 - 92:28)
new players and (92:26 - 92:30)
returning players which is awesome i i (92:28 - 92:31)
feel like a lot of games they always (92:30 - 92:34)
like focus on new players and the (92:31 - 92:35)
returning players are like what am i (92:34 - 92:36)
like i've been playing your game like (92:35 - 92:37)
give me something too i'm playing your (92:36 - 92:39)
game but i think they're doing a really (92:37 - 92:41)
good job at both (92:39 - 92:42)
they are returning some story events (92:41 - 92:44)
here so from september 2nd through the (92:42 - 92:46)
16th uh you have the girl in black and (92:44 - 92:48)
white featuring hilda and ted pig from (92:46 - 92:51)
september 4th through the 16th you have (92:48 - 92:53)
material mining which features material (92:51 - 92:55)
evolutions for evolving pokemon from (92:53 - 92:58)
september 6 through september 16th you (92:55 - 93:00)
have lilly clefairy (92:58 - 93:03)
gladion silvally lusimin and feramosa (93:00 - 93:05)

the uh (93:08 - 93:13)
volkner and lux ray from september 10th (93:10 - 93:15)
through 16th you have (93:13 - 93:16)
uh (93:15 - 93:19)
lis lisia how do you say her name lycia (93:16 - 93:22)
i think it's lisa with altaria which i (93:19 - 93:26)
believe she's steven stone's sister (93:22 - 93:30)
she is wallace's niece (93:26 - 93:31)
oh (93:30 - 93:34)
uh and then you have from september 2nd (93:31 - 93:36)
through the 16th you have the ideal (93:34 - 93:40)
formula which features n and zekrom (93:36 - 93:42)
the thing they don't say here (93:40 - 93:43)
is that these (93:42 - 93:46)
the lilly the stevenstone and the n (93:43 - 93:48)
banners are (93:46 - 93:49)
what do they call them they're called (93:48 - 93:51)
like (93:49 - 93:52)
the (93:51 - 93:54)
they're so the normal banner is a seven (93:52 - 93:57)
percent chance of pulling a five star (93:54 - 93:59)
and usually the the trainer featured in (93:57 - 94:02)
that banner is like a two percent (93:59 - 94:03)
so you have a one in 50 chance of (94:02 - 94:04)
pulling (94:03 - 94:05)
nor (94:04 - 94:06)
detecting (94:05 - 94:08)
percentage-wise and then there's called (94:06 - 94:11)
a fair scout banner yeah which is a (94:08 - 94:13)
which is a instead of a 7 chance of (94:11 - 94:15)
getting a 5 star you have a 10 chance of (94:13 - 94:17)
getting a 5 star and then usually in (94:15 - 94:19)
that banner the same thing it's a two (94:17 - 94:21)
percent chance of getting what you want (94:19 - 94:24)
these are like they are master fair (94:21 - 94:27)
scouts master fair scout so it's a 12 (94:24 - 94:30)
chance of getting a five star but lily (94:27 - 94:33)
steven and n are only a one percent (94:30 - 94:34)
chance (94:33 - 94:36)
which this is not the first time they (94:34 - 94:38)
did it they did this with maxie and (94:36 - 94:40)
archie i believe and one one other they (94:38 - 94:42)
did it with i think but max and archie (94:40 - 94:46)
were the big like one percent (94:42 - 94:46)
these outfits are really great though (94:49 - 94:53)
but they're just outfits (94:51 - 94:55)
steven stones is great lily's is very (94:53 - 94:57)
good ends is fine (94:55 - 94:58)
but it's just the outfit there's no (94:57 - 95:01)
gameplay affecting well so well the (94:58 - 95:04)
pokemon are the game pokemon so (95:01 - 95:07)
judging by how they are (95:04 - 95:09)
what they look to be (95:07 - 95:11)
lily is actually probably the least (95:09 - 95:15)
powerful one of the group but she's (95:11 - 95:15)
probably the best ghost (95:16 - 95:19)
but it's probably the best ghost but (95:18 - 95:21)
there's i mean phoebe's the best ghost (95:19 - 95:23)
like that tank and what (95:21 - 95:25)
phoebe does (95:23 - 95:26)
this (95:25 - 95:28)
lily's not gonna hold a candle that uh (95:26 - 95:31)
yeah but your best ghost type attacker (95:28 - 95:32)
is morty (95:31 - 95:35)
yeah and i'm pretty sure lily's (95:32 - 95:37)
luna is gonna blow morty out of the (95:35 - 95:39)
water probably but you don't really need (95:37 - 95:41)
ghost type attackers (95:39 - 95:44)
uh from what i've seen (95:41 - 95:45)
uh (95:44 - 95:47)
stephen and rayquaza is (95:45 - 95:51)
almost as op as sycamore and xerneas is (95:47 - 95:52)
or (95:51 - 95:54)
well even stephen and metagross i think (95:52 - 95:56)
is still one of the best units you can (95:54 - 95:58)
have like (95:56 - 96:00)
metagross is great from what i (95:58 - 96:02)
understand from looking into it like you (96:00 - 96:05)
want you want stephen stone you want and (96:02 - 96:07)
and then lily is probably gonna be very (96:05 - 96:11)
good but if you have to make a choice uh (96:07 - 96:15)
you're gonna go for steven or n (96:11 - 96:18)
i was hoping the anniversary paid stuff (96:15 - 96:20)
would be better (96:18 - 96:24)
um it is like the best that it can be um (96:20 - 96:26)
but it's (96:24 - 96:28)
well it's the best they're going to do i (96:26 - 96:30)
don't think it's the best it can be no (96:28 - 96:31)
it could definitely be better it is the (96:30 - 96:33)
best they're going to do it is the same (96:31 - 96:35)
deal as the one year anniversary (96:33 - 96:37)
it is like 80 (96:35 - 96:38)
for (96:37 - 96:41)
1400 gems which is like (96:38 - 96:43)
the best they've ever done but they (96:41 - 96:44)
could do better (96:43 - 96:46)
usually the thing if you do want to give (96:44 - 96:48)
masters money your your best bang for (96:46 - 96:50)
your buck is honestly the one dollar for (96:48 - 96:53)
300 gems because that will give you (96:50 - 96:56)
because normally it's one dollar for (96:53 - 96:58)
a hundred gems (96:56 - 96:59)
and then sometimes they do like one (96:58 - 97:02)
dollar for 150 gems but the one dollar (96:59 - 97:05)
for 300 gems you get three (97:02 - 97:07)
uh daily scouts with that (97:05 - 97:09)
that's probably like if you just want to (97:07 - 97:10)
give them a couple bucks and you just (97:09 - 97:12)
want a couple daily scouts especially (97:10 - 97:16)
with like a 12 chance of five star um i (97:12 - 97:17)
think you can buy that like three times (97:16 - 97:19)
so three dollars will get you (97:17 - 97:21)
like nine days of (97:19 - 97:24)
daily scout polls (97:21 - 97:24)
and it's not terribly expensive it's (97:24 - 97:28)
probably more value than anything you're (97:27 - 97:32)
gonna get in an incubator and pogo (97:28 - 97:32)
but i don't i don't know the the i i was (97:33 - 97:38)
going like what could be possibly better (97:36 - 97:40)
than leon (97:38 - 97:42)
and these three are pretty good they're (97:40 - 97:44)
good they're not better but they're good (97:42 - 97:48)
that's a better perspective (97:44 - 97:48)
you know if pokemon masters needed (97:55 - 98:02)
anything to save their game (97:58 - 98:04)
anniversary (98:02 - 98:06)
anniversary (98:04 - 98:08)
all of japan would go (98:06 - 98:10)
all of japan would be in debt (98:08 - 98:12)
i mean for whatever reason barney is (98:10 - 98:14)
like number one in japan they did summer (98:12 - 98:16)
soup marnie (98:14 - 98:18)
and summer soup yeah that's true is is (98:16 - 98:21)
an amazing pair like grim style is so (98:18 - 98:24)
good in the game (98:21 - 98:24)
but when you put that word anniversary (98:25 - 98:29)
in front of it it's all over i mean (98:27 - 98:30)
people like summer as much as like (98:29 - 98:33)
anniversaries yeah yeah yeah what they (98:30 - 98:36)
needed was and surprise (98:33 - 98:37)
mirror bee (98:36 - 98:39)
and there be nobody would be able to (98:37 - 98:40)
resist (98:39 - 98:44)
look if niantic can listen to us dna (98:40 - 98:47)
give me mirror give me the mirror be (98:44 - 98:51)
mere being ludacola not in the game yet (98:47 - 98:53)
save it up for the two and a half year (98:51 - 98:55)
anniversary (98:53 - 98:57)
you know you look at these three sing (98:55 - 99:00)
pairs and you go what can top this (98:57 - 99:02)
what are they gonna do for the three (99:00 - 99:03)
year anniversary (99:02 - 99:05)
i mean we'll have another generation up (99:03 - 99:08)
by then maybe no yeah we'll have they'll (99:05 - 99:12)
bring forward the legends of arceus (99:08 - 99:14)
brought through time (99:12 - 99:16)
we need the uh we are getting chairman (99:14 - 99:18)
rose so swimsuit rose (99:16 - 99:22)
swimsuit rose so we never got beach (99:18 - 99:24)
giovanni which was in the anime we have (99:22 - 99:27)
not gotten beat giovanni yet that is (99:24 - 99:29)
that is a back pocket (99:27 - 99:30)
that is a back pocket hey somebody sent (99:29 - 99:32)
in an email about the like uh they work (99:30 - 99:35)
in a museum and and it was really really (99:32 - 99:35)
good (99:35 - 99:36)
uh (99:35 - 99:39)
remind me we'll do that next week (99:36 - 99:42)
because the show's pokemon masters oh i (99:39 - 99:45)
was thinking of uh arceus sorry (99:42 - 99:49)
the like the sinnoh region and the his (99:45 - 99:50)
region (99:49 - 99:52)
they they had some thoughts and like as (99:50 - 99:54)
being a historian they wanted to share (99:52 - 99:56)
their perspective it was a really good (99:54 - 99:58)
email um (99:56 - 99:59)
so remind me we'll cover that just (99:58 - 100:01)
remember listeners (99:59 - 100:03)
steve forgets about email (100:01 - 100:06)
i do forget about email and then you (100:03 - 100:10)
want my deep dive remind me (100:06 - 100:10)
the real (100:11 - 100:15)
details um i think it's a good look i (100:12 - 100:17)
think this is probably the best time you (100:15 - 100:19)
can try masters and you can probably (100:17 - 100:21)
walk away from it being like i like it (100:19 - 100:23)
or it's not for me yep (100:21 - 100:25)
because you get so many sync pairs (100:23 - 100:26)
there's a lot of events going on they're (100:25 - 100:28)
giving a bunch of free stamina (100:26 - 100:30)
um (100:28 - 100:31)
they brought back a lot of events that (100:30 - 100:34)
give you good free sink pairs (100:31 - 100:36)
so (100:34 - 100:39)
like you can get caught up pretty easy (100:36 - 100:42)
um i am not thrilled with the 140 level (100:39 - 100:45)
cap but whatever yeah and (100:42 - 100:47)
honestly like i'm most of my sync pairs (100:45 - 100:49)
were 120 125 because i didn't even get (100:47 - 100:51)
to the point where when they moved from (100:49 - 100:53)
125 to 130 i was like i'm not doing this (100:51 - 100:55)
right now and the game is played a (100:53 - 100:56)
little bit it's fine i will say if (100:55 - 100:58)
you're a new player (100:56 - 101:00)
there's there's like it says something (100:58 - 101:03)
like hard or super hard or ultra hard (101:00 - 101:05)
like you don't have to do that ultra (101:03 - 101:07)
hard content to enjoy the game it seems (101:05 - 101:08)
like you do because it's like a (101:07 - 101:10)
stepladder (101:08 - 101:12)
but like the ultra hard content is (101:10 - 101:16)
designed for the actual hardcore people (101:12 - 101:17)
so like don't feel bad if you're not (101:16 - 101:19)
doing it like i i can't even remember (101:17 - 101:21)
the last time i did an ultra hard and i (101:19 - 101:22)
was like (101:21 - 101:25)
boy this felt worth it like it is (101:22 - 101:27)
it it it does have a nice reward most of (101:25 - 101:29)
the time but it (101:27 - 101:30)
it's not unnecessary (101:29 - 101:33)
don't feel like oh i'm bad at this game (101:30 - 101:34)
because i can't do like that is that (101:33 - 101:36)
content is designed for people who (101:34 - 101:38)
live and breathe this game and if you're (101:36 - 101:40)
just logging in every day and spending (101:38 - 101:42)
your stamina and just pulling that (101:40 - 101:44)
content's not for you don't don't feel (101:42 - 101:45)
bad if you can't do it yeah just do (101:44 - 101:48)
something else most sync pairs (101:45 - 101:50)
on their sync grid are great at three (101:48 - 101:52)
out of five like (101:50 - 101:54)
you can get through the content you (101:52 - 101:57)
don't need and a lot of them (101:54 - 101:58)
more than you don't need more than three (101:57 - 102:00)
for a lot of them to get everything you (101:58 - 102:02)
need out of their sync grid so like (102:00 - 102:04)
it is really truly one of the games (102:02 - 102:06)
where like this is the hardcore content (102:04 - 102:09)
and it is for hardcore like (102:06 - 102:10)
the hop event is the first time i've (102:09 - 102:13)
ever done the ultra hard ever (102:10 - 102:15)
it was like yeah i'll try it (102:13 - 102:16)
yeah (102:15 - 102:18)
and even even the synchronous stuff (102:16 - 102:20)
almost all that story stuff you do don't (102:18 - 102:22)
even have to touch it (102:20 - 102:24)
nope yep just power up the couple that (102:22 - 102:27)
you really like (102:24 - 102:29)
and uh yeah i think it's fun and then at (102:27 - 102:31)
a certain point you'll be like please (102:29 - 102:34)
let me auto battle (102:31 - 102:36)
yes yes you will (102:34 - 102:38)
uh yeah i think i think pokemon masters (102:36 - 102:40)
ex is in a real real good place right (102:38 - 102:41)
now (102:40 - 102:44)

compared to other of their mobile games (102:44 - 102:50)

one of the gimmicks in digimon at one (104:17 - 104:21)
point was fusions they like took they'll (104:19 - 104:23)
take like two digimons and they fused (104:21 - 104:24)
together (104:23 - 104:27)
and oh fresh ram kirim (104:24 - 104:30)
zekrom they exist i get it they're here (104:27 - 104:31)
but (104:30 - 104:33)
that has to be a gimmick one day of like (104:31 - 104:35)
charizard and mewtwo two of the most (104:33 - 104:38)
popular pokemon like fuse those together (104:35 - 104:40)
i want to see that they did that in the (104:38 - 104:41)
anime with the like it was like a (104:40 - 104:43)
flashback or whatever or like an (104:41 - 104:44)
illusion but like the (104:43 - 104:49)
venus toys where they took the penis (104:44 - 104:52)
so whatever if it's modern past or (104:49 - 104:55)
future i mean that's that's future stuff (104:52 - 104:57)
right that's future give me the fusions (104:55 - 105:00)
i want i want that gimmick that's some (104:57 - 105:02)
cyberpunk (105:00 - 105:04)
wild fusion (105:02 - 105:07)
play with the genes you got your you got (105:04 - 105:09)
your you got your entire race of people (105:07 - 105:12)
that have fused with venusaur dna and so (105:09 - 105:14)
they're plant people and they run around (105:12 - 105:17)
uh (105:14 - 105:17)
there's the alternative timeline where (105:18 - 105:23)
every bad guy wins what they need to win (105:21 - 105:26)
and then giovanni transfers them into (105:23 - 105:28)
the place right and then like wait a (105:26 - 105:31)
minute i don't think they won what they (105:28 - 105:33)
needed to win i think which was true (105:31 - 105:35)
happiness because they're chasing (105:33 - 105:38)
out of their timeline like right before (105:35 - 105:41)
their bitter defeat oh okay more like it (105:38 - 105:42)
yeah (105:41 - 105:43)
and (105:42 - 105:45)
at one point (105:43 - 105:46)
spoilers for the end of ultrasound ultra (105:45 - 105:50)
mood at one point coleris like z zaps in (105:46 - 105:54)
and then grabs gatsas and then zaps out (105:50 - 105:57)
right that's how that happens i kind of (105:54 - 105:59)
remember that yes so i need the (105:57 - 106:02)
futuristic pokemon game where chorus is (105:59 - 106:03)
somewhere there (106:02 - 106:05)
i feel like chorus is the one that's (106:03 - 106:08)
involved in that oh absolutely (106:05 - 106:11)
okay our question from (106:08 - 106:13)
youtube (106:11 - 106:16)
is from void of sin i like this one a (106:13 - 106:18)
lot although we kind of answered it on (106:16 - 106:21)
the patreon bonus podcast but i wasn't i (106:18 - 106:23)
wasn't there that you guys weren't there (106:21 - 106:25)
they say why do you think the graphics (106:23 - 106:27)
complaint started i grew up with pokemon (106:25 - 106:28)
and not once did i ever think about the (106:27 - 106:31)
games looking graphical masterpieces no (106:28 - 106:33)
or cared that they did i don't think the (106:31 - 106:36)
3ds games look good i find it bizarre (106:33 - 106:37)
when people say sword and shield look (106:36 - 106:39)
worse than sun and moon i also find that (106:37 - 106:42)
bizarre um why do people care about uh (106:39 - 106:45)
appearance why do why do appearance (106:42 - 106:47)
matter so much to people nowadays (106:45 - 106:50)
uh i blame steve (106:47 - 106:50)
same (106:52 - 106:56)
okay easy answer uh no the easy answer (106:53 - 106:57)
is like this is all of video games (106:56 - 106:58)
though (106:57 - 107:00)
it doesn't matter what if it's pokemon (106:58 - 107:03)
or halo or call of duty like the graphic (107:00 - 107:05)
like i this is what i said here here's a (107:03 - 107:07)
spoiler for the patreon thing (107:05 - 107:10)
i remember being in high school being on (107:07 - 107:13)
the nintendo forums when nintendo had (107:10 - 107:16)
their own official for like the official (107:13 - 107:19)
nintendo forums and most threads on that (107:16 - 107:22)
forums were non-stop people comparing (107:19 - 107:25)
nintendo games to the xbox 360. because (107:22 - 107:28)
the xbox 360 was coming out and the king (107:25 - 107:30)
kong game was like the graphical (107:28 - 107:32)
powerhouse that was showing it was just (107:30 - 107:36)
day in and day out of nintendo fans (107:32 - 107:38)
saying their graphics don't matter (107:36 - 107:40)
because we got the better games and the (107:38 - 107:42)
xbox looks better but their games aren't (107:40 - 107:46)
like this conversation has existed (107:42 - 107:48)
before the nintendo forums and well (107:46 - 107:50)
after the nintendo forums i mean i will (107:48 - 107:52)
say that (107:50 - 107:54)
it existed (107:52 - 107:56)
back when the hardware was garb like the (107:54 - 107:59)
intellivision versus atari (107:56 - 108:01)
conversations that we had back in the (107:59 - 108:04)
day of the same conversation (108:01 - 108:06)
colecovision which i had i love (108:04 - 108:08)
clicovision um (108:06 - 108:10)
so (108:08 - 108:12)
there's a couple of things (108:10 - 108:15)
we i don't think we can get (108:12 - 108:15)
past the sort of gatekeepy tribal aspect (108:15 - 108:21)
of it right like it starts with the i am (108:18 - 108:23)
an xbox person and therefore i'm going (108:21 - 108:26)
to pick the things that i like and argue (108:23 - 108:27)
that that's better (108:26 - 108:29)
and you're going to get these arguments (108:27 - 108:31)
of (108:29 - 108:33)
this is better x is better because this (108:31 - 108:35)
is the brand they identify with and so (108:33 - 108:38)
like a huge chunk of it is gatekeepy (108:35 - 108:41)
uh intertribal garbage (108:38 - 108:42)
fine (108:41 - 108:46)
i think what we've also run into is (108:42 - 108:48)
we have crossed the (108:46 - 108:50)
technology barrier where (108:48 - 108:52)
a lot of things that we didn't think (108:50 - 108:54)
were possible (108:52 - 108:56)
are now very much possible (108:54 - 108:59)
and we can do them (108:56 - 109:02)
in our hand so it's hard to (108:59 - 109:04)
[Music] (109:02 - 109:06)
translate (109:04 - 109:08)
easily for a lot of people who grew up (109:06 - 109:11)
in a high technology society who didn't (109:08 - 109:15)
who aren't necessarily fully aware of (109:11 - 109:17)
how bad it was (109:15 - 109:19)
to sort of grasp like why can't (109:17 - 109:22)
everything be at x quality because my (109:19 - 109:25)
phone can do it and it's tiny it's in my (109:22 - 109:29)
hand and it's it's it's harder to see (109:25 - 109:32)
because we've made so many advancements (109:29 - 109:33)
how (109:32 - 109:35)
how different hardware powers and (109:33 - 109:37)
different priorities come into play it's (109:35 - 109:40)
a very nuanced conversation that doesn't (109:37 - 109:44)
work on the internet period like so so (109:40 - 109:45)
that argument that's what i call the all (109:44 - 109:48)
the factors argument it's where if you (109:45 - 109:52)
look if you're only looking skin deep (109:48 - 109:53)
you can say (109:52 - 109:54)
well (109:53 - 109:58)
if this game could do it then that game (109:54 - 110:01)
can do it but you're not looking at all (109:58 - 110:03)
the factors yeah right that there's (110:01 - 110:05)
maybe a lot of (110:03 - 110:09)
data weight to the way that the gameplay (110:05 - 110:11)
is designed that takes away from the (110:09 - 110:15)
space available to hold graphic (110:11 - 110:17)
capabilities or music or users or (110:15 - 110:21)
so there are trade-offs (110:17 - 110:21)
i also would want to say like in in line (110:21 - 110:26)
with what greg was saying about tribal (110:23 - 110:28)
there's another thing that we (110:26 - 110:30)
since we don't (110:28 - 110:32)
participate in this and we (110:30 - 110:34)
so we tend to kind of ignore it (110:32 - 110:35)
is (110:34 - 110:37)
it kind of goes in line with when i was (110:35 - 110:40)
younger and i wouldn't listen to like (110:37 - 110:43)
mariah carey or madonna because that's (110:40 - 110:45)
the music everybody else is into and i (110:43 - 110:46)
could only listen to bands that you had (110:45 - 110:47)
never heard (110:46 - 110:49)
because that makes me that makes me a (110:47 - 110:51)
better person right (110:49 - 110:52)
it's (110:51 - 110:56)
and it's like the inverse of that (110:52 - 110:59)
all the all the cool people (110:56 - 111:00)
are (110:59 - 111:02)
crapping on the graphics even though (111:00 - 111:04)
when i watched that that thing i never (111:02 - 111:06)
even thought of the graphics but oh wait (111:04 - 111:09)
wait a minute this cool dude that i look (111:06 - 111:11)
up to on the internet is now saying how (111:09 - 111:13)
terrible those graphics are i'm going to (111:11 - 111:16)
latch on to that argument so i can be (111:13 - 111:17)
like the cool dude because that's (111:16 - 111:19)
obviously the cool dudes arguing whether (111:17 - 111:20)
i actually care about the graphics or (111:19 - 111:23)
not or ever cared before yes that is an (111:20 - 111:25)
argument that i like right for me and i (111:23 - 111:27)
have you know what go through the (111:25 - 111:29)
history of this podcast you can get (111:27 - 111:32)
quotes from me saying a hundred times a (111:29 - 111:33)
thousand times (111:32 - 111:34)
i used to play (111:33 - 111:37)
a game where it was one square shooting (111:34 - 111:40)
a tiny square at another square and my (111:37 - 111:42)
imagination filled in the details i am (111:40 - 111:46)
happy with whatever you give me now it's (111:42 - 111:49)
also hard to (111:46 - 111:50)
get out of (111:49 - 111:53)
negative opinions get more attention (111:50 - 111:55)
than positive opinions yes it's very (111:53 - 111:58)
easy to find a lot of negative opinions (111:55 - 112:00)
on the internet and they draw your (111:58 - 112:02)
attention they make you feel emotions (112:00 - 112:03)
more than (112:02 - 112:05)
positive takes do (112:03 - 112:06)
so (112:05 - 112:08)
it is our natural inclination to find (112:06 - 112:11)
the things that are negative and say (112:08 - 112:13)
hey these are the things that because (112:11 - 112:14)
being negative gets me attention like (112:13 - 112:17)
there's a whole slew of reasons why this (112:14 - 112:20)
conversation comes up um (112:17 - 112:22)
but and it's really people there are (112:20 - 112:23)
some people that genuinely care about (112:22 - 112:25)
graphics though right like there are (112:23 - 112:27)
yeah like to be fair like some people (112:25 - 112:29)
they want a good looking game because (112:27 - 112:30)
that's what they want and that's totally (112:29 - 112:31)
fair (112:30 - 112:33)
and and (112:31 - 112:36)
it is hard to decide divine out what (112:33 - 112:38)
they mean by good looking like i had (112:36 - 112:40)
this conversation after three hours like (112:38 - 112:43)
what do you consider good looking like (112:40 - 112:47)
what exactly do you want it to be (112:43 - 112:49)
and and it (112:47 - 112:51)
the conversation gets very muddy because (112:49 - 112:54)
people don't define their terms and so (112:51 - 112:56)
it's very hard to not have two separate (112:54 - 112:59)
conversations because you're not being (112:56 - 113:01)
specific like you're saying i want (112:59 - 113:03)
graphics to be better but you're not (113:01 - 113:05)
defining what you consider what graphite (113:03 - 113:06)
means (113:05 - 113:08)
are you angry about the watercolor art (113:06 - 113:11)
style or are you angry because the edges (113:08 - 113:13)
aren't smooth (113:11 - 113:15)
right like that's an important thing to (113:13 - 113:17)
divine out of the conversation and i had (113:15 - 113:18)
to have that conversation with a lot of (113:17 - 113:22)
people like what exactly don't you like (113:18 - 113:24)
what do you want to be better because (113:22 - 113:26)
that helps shape whether i agree or (113:24 - 113:28)
disagree with you but it's really easy (113:26 - 113:32)
to say graphics are bad and (113:28 - 113:32)
in what way (113:33 - 113:37)
how hey i said why (113:34 - 113:39)
yeah i wasn't into that ground i wasn't (113:37 - 113:43)
in that water it's also not finished (113:39 - 113:43)
it's the textures it's the textures (113:43 - 113:48)
i mean you know and my argument to (113:46 - 113:50)
people back was like you know we mocked (113:48 - 113:51)
people for the tree argument for two (113:50 - 113:53)
years i'm not going to have a water (113:51 - 113:54)
argument (113:53 - 113:55)
i'm not going to fall into the same trap (113:54 - 113:57)
like the trees are and finish the waters (113:55 - 113:59)
unfinished like it's not an argument i'm (113:57 - 114:01)
having because they're not done (113:59 - 114:03)
oh well the trees were never done (114:01 - 114:05)
these trees will (114:03 - 114:07)
if we go back to the tree (114:05 - 114:10)
argument the game sword and shield ended (114:07 - 114:12)
up looking better of course (114:10 - 114:14)
except the trees (114:12 - 114:18)
uh the the other thing is like (114:14 - 114:18)
uh like people (114:18 - 114:22)
it is weird to me where people are like (114:20 - 114:24)
oh the sort the like sun and moon look (114:22 - 114:25)
better than sword and shield they're (114:24 - 114:27)
just out of their minds they just wanted (114:25 - 114:28)
to make those like like there were (114:27 - 114:30)
people that are are like well pokemon (114:28 - 114:32)
masters looks better than sword and (114:30 - 114:33)
shield (114:32 - 114:35)
and it's like (114:33 - 114:38)
yeah but also pokemon masters is like 3d (114:35 - 114:40)
pokemon and it's just the same pokemon (114:38 - 114:42)
models as sword and shield but like all (114:40 - 114:45)
the backgrounds and masters is like (114:42 - 114:46)
flatness (114:45 - 114:48)
static yeah they're like static (114:46 - 114:50)
backgrounds like you're not moving like (114:48 - 114:52)
you're not moving around in the pokemon (114:50 - 114:54)
center in masters you're just looking at (114:52 - 114:56)
everyone standing there (114:54 - 114:59)
um who are also not moving (114:56 - 115:00)
right (114:59 - 115:02)
it's it's like it's it's really weird i (115:00 - 115:03)
i (115:02 - 115:06)
i am worried that like x and y and sun (115:03 - 115:09)
and moon will start looking very very (115:06 - 115:10)
bad (115:09 - 115:12)
um like how nintendo 64 games don't hold (115:10 - 115:14)
up anymore uh but that doesn't that (115:12 - 115:16)
doesn't really happen with like red and (115:14 - 115:17)
blue or like black and white because (115:16 - 115:20)
they're pixel in a way so they they they (115:17 - 115:22)
look exactly how they look (115:20 - 115:23)
i don't know i don't think pixel art (115:22 - 115:25)
like i don't think (115:23 - 115:26)
super nintendo games (115:25 - 115:30)
or nes games age as poorly as nintendo (115:26 - 115:31)
64 games i (115:30 - 115:34)
i i would disagree they look real bad (115:31 - 115:37)
yeah they do you ever tried ice climbers (115:34 - 115:40)
like take your nostalgia glasses off no (115:37 - 115:42)
it's valuable starter valley looks (115:40 - 115:44)
incredible and it's it's designed to (115:42 - 115:45)
look like a super nintendo game it's (115:44 - 115:47)
designed (115:45 - 115:49)
to look that way but it's not like (115:47 - 115:51)
linked to the past it takes incredible (115:49 - 115:53)
looking it takes the (115:51 - 115:55)
influence (115:53 - 115:57)
of it and puts it in that retro art (115:55 - 116:01)
style but it is not using just 16 bits (115:57 - 116:04)
it is not using just eight bits like you (116:01 - 116:05)
can say and this is the argument i've (116:04 - 116:08)
been having it was done in a retro art (116:05 - 116:11)
style and they did that to appeal to (116:08 - 116:16)
that style but that is not a 16-bit game (116:11 - 116:17)
not by half (116:16 - 116:20)
like you are talking about two different (116:17 - 116:23)
two different aspects (116:20 - 116:26)
8-bit games look terrible they couldn't (116:23 - 116:28)
do better than 8-bit games i think the (116:26 - 116:30)
original super mario brothers and the (116:28 - 116:32)
original legend of zelda (116:30 - 116:34)
on the nes i think they i think they (116:32 - 116:36)
look good yeah but they were pushing the (116:34 - 116:38)
limits of those systems man they were (116:36 - 116:40)
they were but i think i think they're (116:38 - 116:42)
like they do not look (116:40 - 116:43)
i i am sure there are a handful of super (116:42 - 116:45)
nintendo games that look awful but i (116:43 - 116:47)
think like donkey kong country i think (116:45 - 116:50)
legend of zelda i think um (116:47 - 116:52)
yoshi's island like i feel like all (116:50 - 116:54)
those games hold up graphically i think (116:52 - 116:56)
wind waker holds up graphically i don't (116:54 - 116:57)
think (116:56 - 117:00)
gale of darkness or coliseum hold up (116:57 - 117:01)
graphically because they they their (117:00 - 117:04)
nintendo 64 games ported to the gamecube (117:01 - 117:06)
and then run over with a mud truck to (117:04 - 117:09)
like hide the or like to try to smooth (117:06 - 117:11)
things out they look pretty bad um i (117:09 - 117:13)
think stadium does look pretty bad now i (117:11 - 117:15)
think gold and i i don't even know how (117:13 - 117:17)
anyone can play golden eye on the (117:15 - 117:19)
nintendo 64 anymore like (117:17 - 117:21)
geez that looks awful but i think there (117:19 - 117:22)
are some (117:21 - 117:25)
i think there are (117:22 - 117:28)
games that capture a style (117:25 - 117:30)
i don't i'm sure if i'm not actually (117:28 - 117:31)
sure if it's style or graphics or what (117:30 - 117:34)
you want to call it but it ages very (117:31 - 117:36)
well and i think wind waker is the game (117:34 - 117:37)
that age has (117:36 - 117:39)
aged picked (117:37 - 117:43)
a very cartoony art style yes which was (117:39 - 117:45)
a good choice because it helped keep (117:43 - 117:48)
them within the limits of what graphics (117:45 - 117:51)
could do and that's my point that game (117:48 - 117:53)
holds up because they went with a very (117:51 - 117:56)
distinct art style that feels more (117:53 - 117:58)
timeless (117:56 - 118:00)
but that was a choice of making that (117:58 - 118:03)
world is it's the argument people have (118:00 - 118:04)
between world of warcraft and final (118:03 - 118:07)
fantasy both require the same level of (118:04 - 118:09)
graphic cards (118:07 - 118:11)
they look very different (118:09 - 118:14)
one is cartoony one is hyper realistic (118:11 - 118:16)
and you're drawn to one of the two (118:14 - 118:17)
styles but they both (118:16 - 118:21)
burn your cpo at just as much power and (118:17 - 118:23)
will stress your graphics card out it is (118:21 - 118:25)
a hard conversation to have because you (118:23 - 118:27)
have to define (118:25 - 118:30)
what you're talking about and i don't (118:27 - 118:32)
think like an eight the original zelda (118:30 - 118:33)
game (118:32 - 118:36)
with the shooty sword looks good (118:33 - 118:39)
by any modern standards no but you fill (118:36 - 118:41)
it in with your imagination yeah it (118:39 - 118:42)
looks like (118:41 - 118:44)
an old game like (118:42 - 118:46)
you i we all played i don't know if you (118:44 - 118:48)
ever played the game adventure game (118:46 - 118:50)
where the dragon looked like a duck like (118:48 - 118:51)
i have fun (118:50 - 118:54)
that sounds awesome but it is an awful (118:51 - 118:56)
game it is graphically terrible and when (118:54 - 118:58)
i look at i'm like yeah it's awful but i (118:56 - 119:01)
loved it as a kid (118:58 - 119:04)
like it's a very game play was so good (119:01 - 119:06)
the gameplay was great and you got (119:04 - 119:08)
chased by a giant dragon duck yeah (119:06 - 119:10)
i'm into the dragon (119:08 - 119:12)
okay here real simple question uh this (119:10 - 119:14)
is from cayden since apparently (119:12 - 119:16)
everything i was on the table since (119:14 - 119:18)
masculine of all pokemon got an evo (119:16 - 119:19)
which pokemon do you think either in (119:18 - 119:22)
legends or games of head (119:19 - 119:24)
would get one (119:22 - 119:27)
should i get one should get one (119:24 - 119:29)
uh which game (119:27 - 119:30)
which what pokemon do you think should (119:29 - 119:32)
get more love either in legends or games (119:30 - 119:35)
ahead oh i say (119:32 - 119:36)
so standler got an evolution basketball (119:35 - 119:37)

pokemon (119:37 - 119:40)

evolution (119:46 - 119:49)
i'm gonna say miractis i already said (119:50 - 119:54)
miraculous i took it from you say (119:52 - 119:56)
something no you said dunspars i said (119:54 - 119:57)
miractus first because i knew that's (119:56 - 119:58)
what you were getting what'd you say (119:57 - 120:01)
well ice cube ice cube oh ice cube (119:58 - 120:04)
absolutely would be a cutie (120:01 - 120:05)
no (120:04 - 120:08)
evolution i really think i'm gonna die (120:05 - 120:09)
in this hill (120:08 - 120:12)
i want a cat i want a baby cow if it's (120:09 - 120:14)
female it evolves into miltank if it's (120:12 - 120:16)
male it evolves into tauros yeah (120:14 - 120:20)

uh pokemon of the week all right last (120:35 - 120:41)
week's pokemon i was talking about (120:38 - 120:42)
sinnoh bringing that up and the fact (120:41 - 120:44)
that they (120:42 - 120:47)
added a heck ton of (120:44 - 120:49)
new evolutions (120:47 - 120:51)
akin to the question we just had (120:49 - 120:53)
for pokemon that previously did not have (120:51 - 120:55)
evolutions (120:53 - 120:57)
uh and then i said uh the (120:55 - 120:59)
kind of the causes of those news (120:57 - 121:01)
evolutions that were introduced in those (120:59 - 121:04)
games uh some had to evolve while (121:01 - 121:06)
knowing a particular move some had to be (121:04 - 121:09)
exposed to a held item (121:06 - 121:11)
some had to evolve in a special location (121:09 - 121:13)
at least at that time (121:11 - 121:14)
[Music] (121:13 - 121:17)
and some had to be holding a razor slash (121:14 - 121:19)
item at night (121:17 - 121:21)
it was none of those (121:19 - 121:24)
and then there was one other way that (121:21 - 121:25)
you could evolve a pokemon which has (121:24 - 121:28)
been around since generation one (121:25 - 121:30)
um except it had to do this while (121:28 - 121:32)
holding something (121:30 - 121:34)
and then (121:32 - 121:37)
that's all you need that's all you need (121:34 - 121:39)
i gave all the information (121:37 - 121:41)
who's that pokemon (121:39 - 121:43)
it's (121:41 - 121:44)
chat (121:43 - 121:47)
yep (121:44 - 121:47)
shout out holding a leaf (121:47 - 121:51)
chad is in (121:49 - 121:54)
history (121:51 - 121:54)
it was in the art for legends oh yeah (121:54 - 121:59)
yeah yeah chad is yes chat is in there (121:57 - 122:00)
yeah (121:59 - 122:03)
uh it's dust claps (122:00 - 122:06)
dust clops is correct so everybody who (122:03 - 122:07)
guessed dust noir you don't understand (122:06 - 122:11)
how evolution works (122:07 - 122:11)
i mean to be fair i wrote down dusk noir (122:15 - 122:20)
to remind me (122:18 - 122:22)
of a piece of paper that i wanted the (122:20 - 122:24)
one before it (122:22 - 122:24)
dust sorry i didn't have this plastic (122:30 - 122:34)
claps (122:33 - 122:37)
it is the combination of the word dusk (122:34 - 122:39)
and clops (122:37 - 122:42)
cyclops it only has one (122:39 - 122:43)
eye (122:42 - 122:47)
uh very good competitively (122:43 - 122:49)
very good shiny too yeah (122:47 - 122:51)
man is shiny is so good in gen five and (122:49 - 122:53)
then once it gets to the gen six it's so (122:51 - 122:55)
bad (122:53 - 122:58)
how do they mess up colors (122:55 - 122:59)
how (122:58 - 123:01)
how indeed (122:59 - 123:02)
uh (123:01 - 123:04)

noticed that the relatively ubiquitous (123:31 - 123:36)
helper pokemon has a divergent audible (123:33 - 123:38)
vocalization from what appears on the (123:36 - 123:39)
screen (123:38 - 123:41)
the written words make it appear (123:39 - 123:43)
as if it is trying to speak english (123:41 - 123:46)
this pokemon much like its colossian (123:43 - 123:49)
cousin meowstic can have both a (123:46 - 123:51)
different appearance and ability based (123:49 - 123:54)
on its presumed gender (123:51 - 123:55)
that's all that's it that's everything (123:54 - 123:57)
