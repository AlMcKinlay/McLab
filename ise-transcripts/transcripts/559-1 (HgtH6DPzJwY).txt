[Music] (0:13 - 0:23)
what's up everyone welcome to a bonus (0:20 - 0:26)
episode of it's super effective uh we (0:23 - 0:29)
are here to talk about the state of (0:26 - 0:31)
Pokemon unite at least as of the end of (0:29 - 0:35)
March 2023 (0:31 - 0:35)
for months of the podcast by 17 hour (0:36 - 0:42)
rant and it's here now strapping (0:40 - 0:44)
everybody (0:42 - 0:48)
not 17. I have Greg here (0:44 - 0:51)
hi I'm here the Pokemon unite player of (0:48 - 0:53)
the podcast (0:51 - 0:57)
I have uh also special guest zoinks here (0:53 - 1:00)
hey what's going on yeah I to play but I (0:57 - 1:02)
guess not a regular so I can't be the (1:00 - 1:04)
aforementioned player of the podcast but (1:02 - 1:06)
uh but you are the world's commentator (1:04 - 1:07)
that's (1:06 - 1:09)
that's something (1:07 - 1:12)
yeah yeah that is true I commentate for (1:09 - 1:13)
Pokemon unite I did the world's (1:12 - 1:15)
broadcast last year I'm gonna do some (1:13 - 1:17)
more events this year and uh I do still (1:15 - 1:20)
like the game so maybe I'll be the maybe (1:17 - 1:21)
I'll be the positive angle on this (1:20 - 1:23)
podcast we'll see (1:21 - 1:27)
like much of the game (1:23 - 1:30)
that's good yeah that's good all right I (1:27 - 1:34)
haven't played the game in about a month (1:30 - 1:37)
but mostly because Scarlet Violet stuff (1:34 - 1:39)
sure raid events take a lot of time but (1:37 - 1:42)
when I do play it I like it (1:39 - 1:44)
um although I didn't love the new map (1:42 - 1:45)
but (1:44 - 1:48)
yes there's oh boy (1:45 - 1:50)
interesting I liked the new map I liked (1:48 - 1:52)
the new map I don't like the Rayquaza (1:50 - 1:54)
changes I liked the way the way it was (1:52 - 1:56)
before they made it Zapdos to Electric (1:54 - 2:00)
Boogaloo yeah maybe worst Zapdos I don't (1:56 - 2:02)
know it's hard to tell it's hard to tell (2:00 - 2:04)
it is hard to tell if it's a worse (2:02 - 2:05)
Zapdos (2:04 - 2:08)
I think it but I think it feels worse (2:05 - 2:10)
because you think you have a shot of (2:08 - 2:12)
breaking that bubble and you don't you (2:10 - 2:15)
just you just you just don't oh yeah (2:12 - 2:18)
it's it's interesting too because okay (2:15 - 2:21)
for Steve (2:18 - 2:21)
outside uh the rate changes have been (2:21 - 2:27)
like again and again patch after patch (2:25 - 2:28)
they haven't been in a while but when (2:27 - 2:29)
the map first dropped they basically (2:28 - 2:31)
were like all right no one's paying (2:29 - 2:33)
attention to Rayquaza we need to amp (2:31 - 2:34)
this thing up (2:33 - 2:36)
um but the shields that it provides you (2:34 - 2:38)
is what gives you the attack damage buff (2:36 - 2:40)
and your score speed buff so but they've (2:38 - 2:42)
also been introducing a lot of new (2:40 - 2:44)
Pokemon into the game that hit below (2:42 - 2:46)
Shields quite often to like try to (2:44 - 2:49)
counter that or maybe that's why it was (2:46 - 2:50)
a shield in the first place I don't know (2:49 - 2:54)
but like Tyranitar urshifu technically (2:50 - 2:56)
Charizard Once Upon a Time did that but (2:54 - 2:58)
no longer so (2:56 - 3:00)
um I don't know why but anyway so it (2:58 - 3:02)
seems like they're trying to balance on (3:00 - 3:04)
their own and some weird back end style (3:02 - 3:06)
of things I mean it was funny because (3:04 - 3:08)
they people started to ignore Rey (3:06 - 3:11)
because the rest of the game was once (3:08 - 3:13)
again important right so they only (3:11 - 3:15)
ignored Rey if you were playing a good (3:13 - 3:17)
game (3:15 - 3:19)
throughout the game and then when they (3:17 - 3:21)
made the changes to basically make (3:19 - 3:24)
Shields instant score still give you a (3:21 - 3:27)
50 or whatever huge buff against other (3:24 - 3:29)
Pokemon on the other team (3:27 - 3:31)
that it once again became uh the eight (3:29 - 3:34)
minutes up until raid don't matter it's (3:31 - 3:38)
once again a big fight at Rey and it (3:34 - 3:40)
only matters the wrestling game only (3:38 - 3:43)
matters how fast you can level up like (3:40 - 3:45)
it is just a race to try to get to 15. (3:43 - 3:49)
to try to get zashi into 15. let's be (3:45 - 3:50)
honest it's a race against Sashi into 15 (3:49 - 3:53)
and nobody else matters right now in (3:50 - 3:56)
that game well let's let's uh yeah I (3:53 - 3:58)
mean there's a lot of like mechanical (3:56 - 4:00)
things and there's a lot of constant (3:58 - 4:02)
updates but I think I think we could (4:00 - 4:04)
start off talking about like recent (4:02 - 4:05)
characters (4:04 - 4:07)
um so we have we have Goodra we have (4:05 - 4:09)
zashian we have comfy we have Dragon (4:07 - 4:12)
Ball we have urshifu Sableye and that (4:09 - 4:14)
pretty much takes us all the way back to (4:12 - 4:16)
about October yeah (4:14 - 4:18)
um so when scarlet and violet came out (4:16 - 4:21)
or November but you know a lot of people (4:18 - 4:23)
may have might have stepped away from (4:21 - 4:25)
the game like myself because of other (4:23 - 4:28)
games so (4:25 - 4:31)
do we think that these this is a (4:28 - 4:32)
rhetorical question I know the answer I (4:31 - 4:33)
was going to say do we think that these (4:32 - 4:34)
new characters are good enough to bring (4:33 - 4:36)
people like myself or other people (4:34 - 4:38)
listening to the podcast back but it (4:36 - 4:39)
sounds like (4:38 - 4:42)
um zashian alone makes that answer a no (4:39 - 4:44)
so unless you like Sashi and then maybe (4:42 - 4:47)
that's a yes yeah it's tough to answer (4:44 - 4:49)
because (4:47 - 4:51)
like Sable I broke the game in ways that (4:49 - 4:54)
nobody expected to break the game and (4:51 - 4:59)
they got rid of its instant (4:54 - 5:02)
invisibility which I think nerfed (4:59 - 5:04)
stabilize into Oblivion right like you (5:02 - 5:06)
just don't see stable I played that much (5:04 - 5:09)
anymore because if you're going to pick (5:06 - 5:11)
a support you want (5:09 - 5:14)
A Healer and say well I was often the (5:11 - 5:16)
secondary support because it was a (5:14 - 5:19)
scouter it could go get in get out (5:16 - 5:21)
invisible and the invisibility is kind (5:19 - 5:23)
of what broke the game (5:21 - 5:25)
um and so when they nerfed that now (5:23 - 5:29)
everybody runs knockoff and knockoff has (5:25 - 5:29)
some crowd control capabilities and can (5:29 - 5:35)
sometimes stop (5:33 - 5:38)
overpowered Pokemon like zashian (5:35 - 5:41)
from dominating the game but I think (5:38 - 5:44)
like there's a lot of sable I hate that (5:41 - 5:46)
it was like well just wait because worse (5:44 - 5:48)
things are coming (5:46 - 5:51)
that's true I yeah I wonder how much (5:48 - 5:53)
because every now and then let's be (5:51 - 5:55)
honest this is Pokemon that get edge of (5:53 - 5:57)
the game where the overreaction from the (5:55 - 5:58)
community is too much I'm not saying (5:57 - 6:00)
that's every Pokemon I certainly don't (5:58 - 6:04)
certainly not no but stable I maybe one (6:00 - 6:06)
that got a bit of an overreaction for (6:04 - 6:08)
the time that it was out the nurse were (6:06 - 6:10)
necessary I think it's one of those (6:08 - 6:13)
Pokemon though that requires a lot of (6:10 - 6:15)
coordination from the entire team to (6:13 - 6:17)
make work yeah and so a solo queue or (6:15 - 6:19)
even dual or Trio Stacks you're not (6:17 - 6:21)
going to see a stable I succeed very (6:19 - 6:22)
often because there's a lot of things (6:21 - 6:25)
that uh a stable I just can't complete (6:22 - 6:28)
without having full team coordination so (6:25 - 6:30)
yeah it definitely it's a fun Pokemon to (6:28 - 6:33)
play it's uh it's one of the only (6:30 - 6:35)
Pokemon that can provide Wards which I (6:33 - 6:37)
always thought was really cool but it's (6:35 - 6:39)
such a small map and unite it's not as (6:37 - 6:41)
impactful which is a bit of a bummer but (6:39 - 6:43)
I I think the Pokemon is a cool design (6:41 - 6:46)
frustrating to play against for sure but (6:43 - 6:48)
I mean it's a MOBA there's always gonna (6:46 - 6:50)
be yeah there's always gonna be a (6:48 - 6:52)
frustrating character that some people (6:50 - 6:54)
are really good at you just are gonna (6:52 - 6:56)
have a tough time but it's fun for that (6:54 - 6:59)
player so and I think (6:56 - 7:00)
I mean I do think (6:59 - 7:02)
where the table I was first released (7:00 - 7:05)
like it it could dominate it could just (7:02 - 7:08)
be anywhere at any time and and it's (7:05 - 7:11)
it's done capabilities it's immediately (7:08 - 7:13)
hit stunned and then immediately (7:11 - 7:15)
disappear was difficult to deal with (7:13 - 7:17)
um so I kind of get the hate I do think (7:15 - 7:19)
it was overblown on some level because (7:17 - 7:22)
it did require you to be a very good (7:19 - 7:24)
player to pull off stable eye so (7:22 - 7:27)
competitive people were like this is the (7:24 - 7:28)
worst thing that ever happened but (7:27 - 7:30)
everybody else is like I can barely get (7:28 - 7:32)
this to work I don't understand what (7:30 - 7:34)
you're talking about yeah and I think (7:32 - 7:38)
the problem we had with urshifu is one (7:34 - 7:40)
build was so much better than the other (7:38 - 7:42)
when it was released was that the water (7:40 - 7:45)
one or the dark one dark one was dark (7:42 - 7:48)
one dominant like you could like (7:45 - 7:51)
dark build was point an arrow and murder (7:48 - 7:54)
everything for a while (7:51 - 7:55)
um (7:54 - 7:57)
and it's your night move just made that (7:55 - 8:00)
button even better even better like I (7:57 - 8:01)
see people who are like I've come back (8:00 - 8:04)
to play urshifu and I'm already (8:01 - 8:06)
flying through the ranks because it's so (8:04 - 8:08)
easy so our energy food kind of the (8:06 - 8:10)
opposite of stable eye if you're solo (8:08 - 8:12)
queuing Hershey food the go-to they're (8:10 - 8:15)
actually suit food still is kind of a (8:12 - 8:18)
good go-to to go for yes for solo play (8:15 - 8:20)
because it's not (8:18 - 8:23)
it's not a complicated Pokemon to play (8:20 - 8:25)
it is really like Point hit the buttons (8:23 - 8:27)
just keep hitting things and a lot of (8:25 - 8:29)
things will die (8:27 - 8:32)
um it's just it's a lot harder (8:29 - 8:32)
for it to completely dominate I think (8:32 - 8:38)
yeah I mean the changes that I think (8:35 - 8:41)
that brought it back into reality a (8:38 - 8:42)
little bit the changes they made I mean (8:41 - 8:43)
they reduced a lot of just the general (8:42 - 8:45)
stats on the dark building when you use (8:43 - 8:47)
Wicked blow before when you had wikabo (8:45 - 8:50)
plus you were taking 60 less damage (8:47 - 8:53)
while charging it which is yeah and you (8:50 - 8:55)
were Unstoppable and it cleaved so it (8:53 - 8:57)
hit any Target that was within the (8:55 - 8:58)
orange not just one it's like so it's (8:57 - 9:00)
just better than Lucario's power-up (8:58 - 9:03)
punch in every way imaginable (9:00 - 9:04)
um which is really short they tone down (9:03 - 9:06)
those but they also the unite move or (9:04 - 9:07)
she was two unite moves one for (9:06 - 9:09)
blueberry one for one for black bear and (9:07 - 9:12)
when you use the unite it used to knock (9:09 - 9:14)
up everybody in an area of effect into (9:12 - 9:17)
the air now it can only target one which (9:14 - 9:19)
seems way more similar to what they (9:17 - 9:21)
intended and how the design of single (9:19 - 9:22)
strike Hershey food and everything's (9:21 - 9:24)
supposed to work but before you (9:22 - 9:26)
literally yeah they were grouped up yeah (9:24 - 9:28)
everybody (9:26 - 9:32)
sailed you're like what is going on (9:28 - 9:35)
um I think Dragon pulp was the most (9:32 - 9:39)
balanced one they've released it didn't (9:35 - 9:41)
like I'm in the camp that when a new (9:39 - 9:42)
release comes out it should feel (9:41 - 9:45)
slightly overpowered to make it like a (9:42 - 9:48)
draw like I agree that that's well they (9:45 - 9:50)
want to sell characters too right (9:48 - 9:52)
and I don't think that was the case with (9:50 - 9:55)
dragonbolt I think Dragon pulp came in (9:52 - 9:57)
slotted exactly where it needed to be (9:55 - 9:59)
and not much ever has really changed (9:57 - 10:01)
about Dragon Ball so I think a lot of (9:59 - 10:03)
people just felt underwhelmed by (10:01 - 10:06)
dragapult simply because it came in (10:03 - 10:09)
correct (10:06 - 10:09)
that's true I think when you're (10:09 - 10:12)
introducing new Pokemon I think they (10:11 - 10:14)
sort of have two angles I mean you can (10:12 - 10:16)
bring it in really powerful and they can (10:14 - 10:18)
dominate games and that's one appeal the (10:16 - 10:19)
other appeal they try to go for (10:18 - 10:21)
sometimes that I feel comes a little bit (10:19 - 10:23)
less is they try to bring in a brand new (10:21 - 10:25)
mechanic right so staplei was the (10:23 - 10:27)
invisibility yeah I think with dragon (10:25 - 10:28)
pulled they tried to bring in the idea (10:27 - 10:31)
of your unite move is like on a cooldown (10:28 - 10:33)
now and you have two of them and you can (10:31 - 10:35)
constantly use your unite move and drape (10:33 - 10:37)
and destroy or whatever it was but it (10:35 - 10:39)
was underwhelming which is unfortunate (10:37 - 10:42)
it's like zorark's illusion is very (10:39 - 10:46)
underwhelming yeah like nobody really (10:42 - 10:49)
Falls for it like it doesn't do much (10:46 - 10:51)
it's like when it changes into (10:49 - 10:53)
like when people I've seen them come (10:51 - 10:56)
running in as like a bundle bee and (10:53 - 10:57)
you're like (10:56 - 10:59)
well I know you're not a battle because (10:57 - 11:01)
Bunnelby doesn't I mean do you think (10:59 - 11:03)
that's more so like high level play (11:01 - 11:05)
people keeping track of the map people (11:03 - 11:06)
keeping track of the characters people (11:05 - 11:08)
paying attention to you like unite like (11:06 - 11:10)
I played the game for what like six (11:08 - 11:11)
months before I realized the little (11:10 - 11:13)
yellow dots on the very top show your (11:11 - 11:16)
part your teammate has their unite move (11:13 - 11:18)
like I didn't notice that right away but (11:16 - 11:21)
I'd be curious if like casual play (11:18 - 11:23)
people are getting tricked by zorark I (11:21 - 11:24)
think the problem is is that your your (11:23 - 11:28)
auto attacks often Target are designed (11:24 - 11:31)
to Target the enemy so when something's (11:28 - 11:32)
running in (11:31 - 11:35)
and you're just Auto attacking you will (11:32 - 11:36)
just hit it and you're like well why am (11:35 - 11:39)
I attacking oh wait okay (11:36 - 11:43)
cool yeah it has the one benefit around (11:39 - 11:47)
it of that when you use illusion uh for (11:43 - 11:48)
Ace like I think it's like a half a (11:47 - 11:50)
second basically one or two frames you (11:48 - 11:52)
have invincibility yeah when you are (11:50 - 11:55)
like changing so really really good (11:52 - 11:58)
players can can try to time that and use (11:55 - 11:59)
that to dodge an ability or something (11:58 - 12:01)
like that it's tough to pull up the one (11:59 - 12:04)
negative it has is when you use that (12:01 - 12:06)
illusion if comfae is writing you it (12:04 - 12:09)
gets dropped off and so I've seen a lot (12:06 - 12:10)
of times like okay like supporting a (12:09 - 12:12)
zorark they jump into the enemy backline (12:10 - 12:14)
try to use illusion to dodge and attack (12:12 - 12:17)
and all of a sudden poor cone face (12:14 - 12:20)
alone in the middle of enemies it's a (12:17 - 12:22)
it's a tough spot to be in here I mean (12:20 - 12:25)
Kofi came in came in bad let's just well (12:22 - 12:27)
so everyone thought come fit was going (12:25 - 12:28)
to come in (12:27 - 12:31)
incredibly overpowered and ruining the (12:28 - 12:33)
game but it seems like it didn't do that (12:31 - 12:36)
it didn't do that until they buffed it (12:33 - 12:39)
yet and now it has (12:36 - 12:41)
so Comfort came in (12:39 - 12:44)
weak because it was bad on the play test (12:41 - 12:46)
and so they really came in like we know (12:44 - 12:48)
this is a controversial character in (12:46 - 12:51)
league and we're gonna really step away (12:48 - 12:53)
from it and it came in and people were (12:51 - 12:55)
like it's bad (12:53 - 12:57)
so then they buffed it (12:55 - 13:01)
and it's like okay this felt good until (12:57 - 13:04)
zashian and to some level goudra came in (13:01 - 13:07)
because confuse role now is to take the (13:04 - 13:09)
thing that's broken and make it more (13:07 - 13:12)
broken yes so it will attached to things (13:09 - 13:14)
and you're like well (13:12 - 13:17)
not only is zashian and Goodra next to (13:14 - 13:20)
impossible to kill the thing that's (13:17 - 13:22)
around it I can't even Target and that (13:20 - 13:25)
thing is just keeping them alive so I (13:22 - 13:27)
can't kill the thing and I can't kill (13:25 - 13:29)
the other thing but come fade probably (13:27 - 13:31)
suffers the same thing as Sableye does (13:29 - 13:34)
which is probably useless in solo queue (13:31 - 13:36)
yeah (13:34 - 13:40)
yes other than if less universations (13:36 - 13:42)
then you don't need to do anything no (13:40 - 13:44)
then you just click one button and (13:42 - 13:46)
you're set and yourself the problem is (13:44 - 13:49)
if you can in a Duo queue like if you (13:46 - 13:52)
can do like comfy because like I'm gonna (13:49 - 13:54)
play Sasha and you'll play gunfate and (13:52 - 13:56)
we the convey player never has to do a (13:54 - 13:58)
thing okay so you're telling me the (13:56 - 14:00)
easiest way to climb to master rank I (13:58 - 14:02)
get one other person they they pick (14:00 - 14:05)
comfy I pick zashian or Goodra and we we (14:02 - 14:08)
getting W's yeah you're making it too (14:05 - 14:10)
hard you're making it two switches two (14:08 - 14:12)
Nintendo switches and two Pokemon unite (14:10 - 14:16)
accounts and one instance of OBS and (14:12 - 14:18)
you're set you just have to hit one (14:16 - 14:21)
button I mean Kofi is interesting and I (14:18 - 14:26)
think it's a good idea dear I I just (14:21 - 14:28)
think (14:26 - 14:28)
they need to make it more complicated (14:29 - 14:33)
because once you are attached it's (14:31 - 14:34)
pretty much one button and you don't (14:33 - 14:36)
ever have to worry about scoring with (14:34 - 14:40)
comfae like you don't really like (14:36 - 14:42)
yeah (14:40 - 14:46)
uh and since XP share is a thing you (14:42 - 14:47)
don't really also have to worry about it (14:46 - 14:48)
leveling (14:47 - 14:50)
that much (14:48 - 14:51)
um (14:50 - 14:53)
and (14:51 - 14:53)
yeah (14:54 - 14:58)
I just think like there are Master (14:55 - 15:00)
players who are really good at bounce (14:58 - 15:02)
income payoff and bouncing out and (15:00 - 15:04)
really doing some incredible things like (15:02 - 15:07)
convey can be devastating on its own if (15:04 - 15:09)
you really want to bounce the problem is (15:07 - 15:11)
you don't have to do that you can get on (15:09 - 15:13)
it just hit your one button and then (15:11 - 15:13)
heal (15:13 - 15:16)
be like I just heal them and now I'm (15:13 - 15:18)
building up my flowers and I'm gonna (15:16 - 15:19)
heal (15:18 - 15:20)
um (15:19 - 15:25)
I think these last three are are are the (15:20 - 15:27)
problems that we've run into like gouda (15:25 - 15:29)
is really really good I don't think it's (15:27 - 15:32)
overpowered I think it's super hard to (15:29 - 15:34)
kill (15:32 - 15:36)
um which is kind of the design of the (15:34 - 15:38)
design of Defender yeah it's like yeah (15:36 - 15:41)
it's like no other Defender however is (15:38 - 15:44)
that Healy I don't think (15:41 - 15:46)
yeah that is true I I actually I think (15:44 - 15:47)
that good just are the best design (15:46 - 15:50)
they've done in a while just in terms of (15:47 - 15:51)
at release like I feel similar to Dragon (15:50 - 15:54)
pull it doesn't feel like you can win (15:51 - 15:56)
entire games just by picking this (15:54 - 15:58)
Pokemon but it seems like if you were (15:56 - 16:00)
good at the play style that Goodra is (15:58 - 16:01)
trying to push you'll be all right (16:00 - 16:04)
however if you are like just learning (16:01 - 16:07)
Goodra it can feel challenging like it (16:04 - 16:08)
is really tough to get you knocked out (16:07 - 16:11)
but likewise in trying to get kills (16:08 - 16:13)
yourself like right it can be really (16:11 - 16:16)
challenging to do that so kudra is a (16:13 - 16:18)
pure defender in that it it doesn't do a (16:16 - 16:19)
ton of it doesn't really seem to do a (16:18 - 16:22)
ton of damage yet but it is hard to kill (16:19 - 16:24)
so it can just sit on a goal and (16:22 - 16:26)
interrupt you so the opposite of what a (16:24 - 16:27)
Blastoise was introduced because (16:26 - 16:29)
Blastoise came in as like oh you're a (16:27 - 16:31)
great attacker even though it's yes (16:29 - 16:35)
Defender and you're paper thin (16:31 - 16:35)
in like the in coordinated play or (16:40 - 16:44)
whatever often just the top path is (16:42 - 16:46)
considered a is considered a role often (16:44 - 16:48)
you'll just put one Pokemon there uh (16:46 - 16:50)
usually a Pokemon that wants to stack (16:48 - 16:53)
like via attack weight EOS cookie or (16:50 - 16:55)
special attack specs and Blastoise loves (16:53 - 16:58)
special attack specs so oftentimes (16:55 - 16:59)
Blastoise will find itself on the top (16:58 - 17:02)
path and spin stoices he likes to refer (16:59 - 17:04)
to oh are we are we are we still in the (17:02 - 17:08)
one on top three on the bottom meta no (17:04 - 17:11)
we have flipped a two one two again yeah (17:08 - 17:13)
um but uh yeah suavements had one one (17:11 - 17:15)
three in a bit but we haven't had I (17:13 - 17:17)
think because (17:15 - 17:20)
they're still (17:17 - 17:20)
the leveling across the board is so (17:22 - 17:28)
important again so if you have three in (17:25 - 17:30)
the bottom there's just not enough XP (17:28 - 17:31)
down there (17:30 - 17:34)
to to like somebody is going to suffer (17:31 - 17:37)
down there so you need to be eating up (17:34 - 17:39)
as much experience as you can which (17:37 - 17:41)
means you cannot leave (17:39 - 17:44)
wild Pokemon uncontested up top you just (17:41 - 17:47)
you just can't because leveling is King (17:44 - 17:48)
again (17:47 - 17:50)
um which is frustrating that people (17:48 - 17:52)
don't once again the problem is people (17:50 - 17:55)
don't come down to the XP Giver (17:52 - 17:57)
at the bottom which is the Reggie (17:55 - 17:58)
because it doesn't matter which Reggie (17:57 - 18:01)
it is the XP boost is what you need down (17:58 - 18:05)
there so people are still in the mindset (18:01 - 18:09)
that scoring is the most important and (18:05 - 18:12)
it's not because of Rayquaza at the end (18:09 - 18:15)
yeah I don't know who told the masses (18:12 - 18:18)
that Reggio lucky was it (18:15 - 18:18)
about a week yeah maybe (18:19 - 18:25)
I guess yes it is nice to have but only (18:23 - 18:28)
if you can break like two goal zones in (18:25 - 18:30)
that lane like which is a tough thing to (18:28 - 18:33)
do for and like just random pickup teams (18:30 - 18:35)
at the same time and it was just oh yeah (18:33 - 18:37)
you're so lucky your games as soon as (18:35 - 18:39)
everyone's pinging to gather up there (18:37 - 18:41)
and then if you don't go up there then (18:39 - 18:43)
they get really mad and start pinging (18:41 - 18:44)
you the whole game because you didn't (18:43 - 18:47)
show up to regilecki that's just the the (18:44 - 18:51)
thanks pingers are some of the worst (18:47 - 18:54)
people in that game yeah yeah top of the (18:51 - 18:57)
list for sure they finally changed it (18:54 - 18:59)
though when you mute people you actually (18:57 - 19:01)
mute their pings as well yeah which is (18:59 - 19:04)
awesome oh okay that used to not be in (19:01 - 19:05)
the game you used to just mute their (19:04 - 19:07)
like voice communication if they if they (19:05 - 19:08)
had that turned on on a mobile or (19:07 - 19:10)
something like that but now it actually (19:08 - 19:12)
commutes their ping so one of the best (19:10 - 19:15)
features they've added yes it's been (19:12 - 19:18)
great okay so zashian showed up uh (19:15 - 19:22)
around Pokemon day uh and of course came (19:18 - 19:24)
in overpowered like a lot of Pokemon (19:22 - 19:26)
come in overpower came and overpowered (19:24 - 19:28)
and Incredibly bugged we can't forget (19:26 - 19:30)
that it showed up there was a bug yes (19:28 - 19:33)
horrifically when I heard people talking (19:30 - 19:35)
about zashian being overpowered I (19:33 - 19:37)
personally wasn't surprised as somebody (19:35 - 19:41)
who played VGC and I remember building a (19:37 - 19:43)
team for VGC going into the final season (19:41 - 19:46)
and my coach uh Joe ux9 (19:43 - 19:49)
uh he was like all right uh how do you (19:46 - 19:50)
feel about zashian and I was like I'm (19:49 - 19:53)
not a big fan of zashian and he was like (19:50 - 19:54)
what are what are your what are your (19:53 - 19:56)
what are your complaints and I was like (19:54 - 19:58)
ah I'm not sure I don't really like the (19:56 - 20:00)
substitute and he's like okay we don't (19:58 - 20:01)
have to run substitute and I was like (20:00 - 20:03)
okay well he's like you don't have any (20:01 - 20:05)
other reasons and I was like no I guess (20:03 - 20:06)
that was kind of it and he was like well (20:05 - 20:07)
do you want to win and I was like yeah (20:06 - 20:09)
and he was like okay we're gonna use (20:07 - 20:10)
ashian because like (20:09 - 20:13)
why would you not like it it just so it (20:10 - 20:16)
was just so dominant in the VGC scene uh (20:13 - 20:19)
and I've grown to like zashian a lot (20:16 - 20:21)
because I was kind of forced to use it (20:19 - 20:23)
but this this seemed a bit different in (20:21 - 20:26)
unite probably because of the bug (20:23 - 20:30)
yeah they fixed they did (20:26 - 20:33)
um I think the bug where it ignored 100 (20:30 - 20:35)
of everybody's defenses so it could just (20:33 - 20:36)
stand in the middle of five people and (20:35 - 20:38)
Kill Them All (20:36 - 20:40)
uh it was like (20:38 - 20:41)
this is why you should have put it on (20:40 - 20:43)
the play test instead of kept it a (20:41 - 20:44)
secret (20:43 - 20:47)
because we gotta found it but the the (20:44 - 20:51)
weird choice that they made (20:47 - 20:54)
with zashian's stats (20:51 - 20:57)
made it (20:54 - 20:59)
you just had to question like (20:57 - 21:03)
it's it's it's better at every role (20:59 - 21:06)
than every other Pokemon who is assigned (21:03 - 21:08)
to their specific role like the only (21:06 - 21:11)
thing that's not better at is being a (21:08 - 21:13)
supporter (21:11 - 21:15)
yeah it has better defenses than most (21:13 - 21:17)
Defenders it has better attack than most (21:15 - 21:22)
attackers it has better it's it is (21:17 - 21:22)
to say it's overpowered in a way like oh (21:23 - 21:30)
it's just op doesn't do justice to how (21:27 - 21:33)
deliberately they designed those stats (21:30 - 21:35)
to be (21:33 - 21:39)
obnoxious right I think the ones were (21:35 - 21:40)
referred to the screenshot that was (21:39 - 21:42)
going around as lotion stats was the (21:40 - 21:45)
level one's awesome stats are greninjas (21:42 - 21:47)
at level seven yeah they're almost (21:45 - 21:50)
identical yeah you can say the HP attack (21:47 - 21:53)
value like all defenses all of it which (21:50 - 21:57)
Greninja will outscale zashin at like 13 (21:53 - 22:00)
12 and up sort of at that level because (21:57 - 22:02)
yes it's a three evolution Pokemon it's (22:00 - 22:03)
kind of how they're designed they're (22:02 - 22:06)
gonna scale the single Evolution but I (22:03 - 22:08)
mean zation stats also go up throughout (22:06 - 22:11)
the game like it is it is a little wild (22:08 - 22:13)
and when you've had when we say that (22:11 - 22:15)
it's good at every role it's not even (22:13 - 22:17)
just statistics like the move set that (22:15 - 22:20)
it has is kind of allows it to (22:17 - 22:21)
circumvent any weakness you would think (22:20 - 22:24)
of of an all-arounder like agility is (22:21 - 22:26)
the most frequently picked move you have (22:24 - 22:28)
like three uses of it you could speed (22:26 - 22:30)
boost to basically the other side of any (22:28 - 22:33)
engagement you're on so range isn't (22:30 - 22:35)
something you're worried about uh sacred (22:33 - 22:38)
swords area of effect that it damages is (22:35 - 22:41)
absurdly high is the stun lasts forever (22:38 - 22:43)
so you're providing the same amount of (22:41 - 22:45)
crowd control as like a Snorlax heavy (22:43 - 22:47)
slam the damage is so high too like (22:45 - 22:50)
there's just the Swiss army knife that (22:47 - 22:53)
sashin is is way too much yeah like it (22:50 - 22:55)
just it does too many things really well (22:53 - 22:58)
which going forward is a big concern for (22:55 - 23:00)
me because if we're gonna tune this (22:58 - 23:04)
thing just by numbers like they need to (23:00 - 23:06)
tarnish this Pokemon they need to (23:04 - 23:09)
destroy it by numbers because everything (23:06 - 23:11)
else is also so good about this Pokemon (23:09 - 23:14)
now I don't mind if it's a good Pokemon (23:11 - 23:17)
and if it can be that jack of all trades (23:14 - 23:19)
they just want it to be a master of not (23:17 - 23:22)
something that's all right and like I (23:19 - 23:23)
know that they thought (23:22 - 23:26)
like you have to Power It Up by spending (23:23 - 23:28)
as energy which you can tell a person (23:26 - 23:30)
who is new to the Russian does not (23:28 - 23:31)
understand that because you're like why (23:30 - 23:33)
is this exhaustion hitting me for (23:31 - 23:36)
literally nothing what are you not doing (23:33 - 23:37)
because they don't understand that (23:36 - 23:41)
mechanic and I think they believed that (23:37 - 23:44)
that would be enough to counter it but (23:41 - 23:46)
the problem is is that it Powers up and (23:44 - 23:48)
when it kills everybody it just goes (23:46 - 23:49)
around and picks up the as energy that (23:48 - 23:51)
it just (23:49 - 23:54)
spent so it's like you just murdered (23:51 - 23:57)
everybody for a cost but you've made up (23:54 - 23:59)
that cost almost immediately because you (23:57 - 24:01)
killed five things around you money (23:59 - 24:03)
moves and since (24:01 - 24:05)
leveling and not scoring is more (24:03 - 24:09)
important it will sit at 30 40 50 (24:05 - 24:12)
because it's trying to level as fast as (24:09 - 24:15)
possible to become Unstoppable I mean I (24:12 - 24:17)
could see the risk of (24:15 - 24:20)
you pay a cost to hopefully get it back (24:17 - 24:24)
or you pay a cost and you lost and you (24:20 - 24:25)
lost everything (24:24 - 24:27)
I could see that balance it just doesn't (24:25 - 24:30)
seem to pan out it's just not there yet (24:27 - 24:34)
yeah yeah it I just don't know if we can (24:30 - 24:36)
push or pull that metric enough to (24:34 - 24:38)
balance this Pokemon even if it's you (24:36 - 24:40)
use this and it uses all of your AOS (24:38 - 24:43)
energy no matter what like I don't know (24:40 - 24:45)
that's still I don't even know if that (24:43 - 24:48)
would really bring it into uh into (24:45 - 24:50)
balance with this Pokemon I'm not sure (24:48 - 24:54)
I remember when Mew came out I felt (24:50 - 24:57)
I did feel cheated like playing against (24:54 - 24:59)
Mew and Mew being so strong right off (24:57 - 25:00)
the bat (24:59 - 25:02)
um is that similar to zashian or is (25:00 - 25:06)
zashian just uh exaggerated even more (25:02 - 25:10)
Mew Mew was bad but you could take out a (25:06 - 25:11)
Mew (25:10 - 25:15)
like you could you could get up onto a (25:11 - 25:18)
Mew and be like I'm now because Mew (25:15 - 25:21)
could destroy you at range but got (25:18 - 25:23)
weaker when you got close (25:21 - 25:26)
yeah and it did have absurdly high (25:23 - 25:28)
defenses for being arranged attackers (25:26 - 25:31)
come on but yes it that was a good way (25:28 - 25:33)
to counter also Mew got hurt by a lot of (25:31 - 25:36)
the map changes they implemented on uh (25:33 - 25:38)
on the map and Thea they removed a lot (25:36 - 25:41)
of just the kind of small camps of wild (25:38 - 25:43)
Pokemon they had especially in top path (25:41 - 25:45)
and Muse mechanics with solar beams that (25:43 - 25:47)
the cooldown resets get lower the more (25:45 - 25:49)
targets it hit and so you were basically (25:47 - 25:51)
just spamming a few in a row because you (25:49 - 25:53)
were always hitting some wild Pokemon as (25:51 - 25:55)
well so there was just like a lot of (25:53 - 25:58)
chances from you to play around they've (25:55 - 26:00)
toned it down a bit it helped yeah it (25:58 - 26:01)
was particularly bad when there was a (26:00 - 26:02)
three up top because maybe we'd just go (26:01 - 26:05)
up there and hit those three with solar (26:02 - 26:07)
beam and it's like I just recharge uh (26:05 - 26:09)
and so when they fixed that it fixed me (26:07 - 26:14)
I mean Mew was op but it was not (26:09 - 26:17)
I I don't think people were that upset (26:14 - 26:19)
about me being overpowered as they are (26:17 - 26:21)
with zashian (26:19 - 26:24)
yeah but then we have Goodra which just (26:21 - 26:26)
came out like a week ago (26:24 - 26:27)
hmm (26:26 - 26:31)
almost available for coins past their (26:27 - 26:34)
gym lock date but uh I I think I think (26:31 - 26:37)
goodra's pretty great it is one of our (26:34 - 26:41)
first um hook Pokemon which is a very (26:37 - 26:43)
love it or hate it style mechanic in a (26:41 - 26:46)
lot of MOBA games it's pretty tame in (26:43 - 26:47)
terms of other games of how this hook (26:46 - 26:49)
works but I guess ghastly technically (26:47 - 26:52)
has like but uh Power whip on Goodra is (26:49 - 26:54)
a really fun move to play around you (26:52 - 26:56)
grab weaker targets pull them back in (26:54 - 26:58)
hope you didn't grab zation because (26:56 - 27:01)
you've just doomed your team but it is (26:58 - 27:03)
uh it is a fun Pokemon to play around I (27:01 - 27:06)
think goodra's in a solid spot it's um (27:03 - 27:09)
the new held item I think is what makes (27:06 - 27:12)
this Pokemon actually feel a little on (27:09 - 27:15)
the strong side because of the spoon the (27:12 - 27:19)
new spoon item they gave is crazy good (27:15 - 27:21)
for special attackers it is uh yeah it (27:19 - 27:23)
is doing really well for a lot of them (27:21 - 27:24)
and kudra's one of them that is uh (27:23 - 27:27)
benefiting a lot from that new item (27:24 - 27:31)
so the news uh slick spoon item is the (27:27 - 27:32)
new spoon (27:31 - 27:36)
uh and it uh (27:32 - 27:36)
it has the ability that a damage dealt (27:37 - 27:41)
by special attack will ignore a certain (27:39 - 27:44)
percentage of the enemy's special (27:41 - 27:46)
defense (27:44 - 27:47)
um so it's one of the it's one of the (27:46 - 27:49)
ways I think they were like well let's (27:47 - 27:52)
maybe get past the bubble thing at the (27:49 - 27:54)
end and this item helps I don't think it (27:52 - 27:55)
does enough (27:54 - 28:00)
but it is on on special attackers it it (27:55 - 28:03)
really does and it really helped push (28:00 - 28:06)
special attackers up (28:03 - 28:08)
um I think it's what helps uh Slowpoke (28:06 - 28:11)
be (28:08 - 28:11)
better (28:12 - 28:15)
what was the other new item the drain (28:13 - 28:17)
crone (28:15 - 28:21)
rapid fire scar oh rescue yeah (28:17 - 28:22)
yeah (28:21 - 28:26)
rescue hood is very (28:22 - 28:26)
situational and I don't know who exactly (28:26 - 28:31)
it's good for other than copay (28:29 - 28:34)
yeah I've kind of heard that it's only (28:31 - 28:36)
comfy and even then a lot of people are (28:34 - 28:38)
saying that it's not even that good on (28:36 - 28:40)
comfy but so the weird thing about (28:38 - 28:44)
rescue hood is that it increased (28:40 - 28:47)
it increased recovery (28:44 - 28:50)
from Shields (28:47 - 28:51)
but it doesn't (28:50 - 28:55)
it seems to only help allies and not (28:51 - 28:58)
the The Shield maker so people who have (28:55 - 29:00)
who make their own Shields aren't (28:58 - 29:03)
benefited from it and there's not many (29:00 - 29:08)
Pokemon that put up Shields like (29:03 - 29:11)
I think you would think Zarina has the (29:08 - 29:12)
ability to put shields on herself so (29:11 - 29:13)
this would be really good but it doesn't (29:12 - 29:16)
work elthegos a very specific if you use (29:13 - 29:20)
the one build get some benefit from it (29:16 - 29:23)
but I mean I mean I'm a shield to Elder (29:20 - 29:25)
Goss and I don't use it because I don't (29:23 - 29:28)
want to give up rapid scarf yeah Elder (29:25 - 29:29)
cost is one of the best a button (29:28 - 29:32)
pressers in the game so you just you (29:29 - 29:33)
want to have as much Auto attack speed (29:32 - 29:36)
as you possibly can on that Pokemon and (29:33 - 29:39)
yeah you're giving up share and you need (29:36 - 29:43)
the mobility of floatstone really yeah (29:39 - 29:45)
yeah so like one floater muscle but yeah (29:43 - 29:47)
so like (29:45 - 29:50)
Elder gas which is what I mean I don't I (29:47 - 29:53)
I I don't see it being a big enough (29:50 - 29:56)
Shield boost to make it worse to give up (29:53 - 29:58)
the other things I need Elder Gus to do (29:56 - 30:00)
yeah (29:58 - 30:02)
yeah that item Desmond didn't feel as (30:00 - 30:03)
good now there were some other ones you (30:02 - 30:05)
mentioned like drain crown that one (30:03 - 30:07)
unfortunately feels not very good (30:05 - 30:09)
outside of like maybe a niche or two (30:07 - 30:12)
case but yeah rapid fire scarf on the (30:09 - 30:14)
other hand that item is unbelievably (30:12 - 30:17)
good that's a lot of fun great it is I (30:14 - 30:18)
think it might be one of my favorite (30:17 - 30:19)
instructions they've done yeah Dragon (30:18 - 30:21)
pulp works really well on it if you like (30:19 - 30:23)
going pew pew it is the best item in the (30:21 - 30:26)
game it's so good yeah (30:23 - 30:29)
even though he's busted now yeah it's (30:26 - 30:31)
pretty good on crime rats actually it's (30:29 - 30:35)
great on camera so grain Town drain (30:31 - 30:37)
Crown healed you based off of your (30:35 - 30:41)
attack but healing yourself (30:37 - 30:44)
is not (30:41 - 30:48)
that worth it yeah it just doesn't you (30:44 - 30:50)
don't ever heal yourself enough to make (30:48 - 30:52)
up like if you're in a one one-on-one (30:50 - 30:54)
it's just not going to (30:52 - 30:55)
do (30:54 - 30:57)
anything the thing about what happened (30:55 - 30:59)
works on and it doesn't heal you off of (30:57 - 31:01)
shields right no like if you do damage (30:59 - 31:03)
the shields it doesn't heal it doesn't (31:01 - 31:06)
which is a lot of time so yeah it's a (31:03 - 31:09)
bad spot rapid fire scarf is interesting (31:06 - 31:12)
in that it (31:09 - 31:15)
increases your basic attack speed (31:12 - 31:18)
after you've completed three basic (31:15 - 31:20)
attacks so why it's so good on Elder (31:18 - 31:23)
gases Elder gas has a slowing that (31:20 - 31:25)
slowing ability so you can slow them and (31:23 - 31:27)
then you suddenly are just firing (31:25 - 31:30)
a lot of attacks after and it is it is a (31:27 - 31:32)
way to sort of (31:30 - 31:34)
scare (31:32 - 31:35)
things off or slow something down and (31:34 - 31:37)
set them up to be taken down so people (31:35 - 31:39)
who do a lot of basic attacks are really (31:37 - 31:41)
really really benefit from Rapid scarf (31:39 - 31:45)
and it's a very good item in that way (31:41 - 31:47)
um and they added the little symbols at (31:45 - 31:48)
the bottom so you can see when your (31:47 - 31:51)
rapid scarf is on cooldown and attack (31:48 - 31:53)
weight you could actually see your (31:51 - 31:55)
Stacks now which is nice (31:53 - 31:56)
um it's actually opened up a cool (31:55 - 31:58)
strategy in the in the competitive meta (31:56 - 32:00)
game as well where you can actually put (31:58 - 32:03)
your Elder gas into the top hat and you (32:00 - 32:05)
will give your Elder gas the red buff to (32:03 - 32:07)
start off the game and allow your (32:05 - 32:09)
jungler to go take whatever else but if (32:07 - 32:10)
you have red buff which slows the (32:09 - 32:12)
enemies with your boosted Auto attacks (32:10 - 32:14)
and Elder gas's passive of slowing the (32:12 - 32:16)
enemies like they are like walking (32:14 - 32:17)
through molasses when they're trying to (32:16 - 32:19)
run away from this tiny little flower (32:17 - 32:20)
yeah (32:19 - 32:25)
it's like crazy it is it is wild it is a (32:20 - 32:26)
really really good Pokemon right now I (32:25 - 32:29)
love so like (32:26 - 32:32)
Pokemon aside busted or not I mean there (32:29 - 32:35)
there's new items there's still the uh (32:32 - 32:37)
metal mechanic is that what we're (32:35 - 32:41)
calling the emblems emblem mechanic uh (32:37 - 32:43)
is this is this overwhelming for (32:41 - 32:44)
somebody who stepped away from the game (32:43 - 32:47)
for a couple months (32:44 - 32:47)
probably I I (32:50 - 32:54)
heard quite a few things but I think it (32:52 - 32:57)
get it so I I think it depends on what (32:54 - 33:00)
they're trying to do when they enter (32:57 - 33:01)
um like (33:00 - 33:04)
most of the modes don't emblems and (33:01 - 33:06)
items don't make that big of a (33:04 - 33:08)
difference because you're playing with a (33:06 - 33:09)
bunch of other people who also don't (33:08 - 33:11)
know anything about that like standard (33:09 - 33:15)
matches our Pure chaos like it's just (33:11 - 33:17)
you have no idea what's going on no idea (33:15 - 33:21)
what's going through I think it is (33:17 - 33:23)
I think it can be very overwhelming for (33:21 - 33:25)
somebody like I want to get into ranked (33:23 - 33:29)
and now I have to understand (33:25 - 33:32)
a bunch of systems they do help for (33:29 - 33:34)
health items they do help that you can (33:32 - 33:35)
go in (33:34 - 33:37)
to the Pokemon and say give me (33:35 - 33:39)
suggestions and it will say here's what (33:37 - 33:42)
the top people are doing just put those (33:39 - 33:44)
on (33:42 - 33:47)
um and emblems give an edge but I don't (33:44 - 33:49)
think (33:47 - 33:51)
well there was a point with like Kramer (33:49 - 33:53)
and specifically where it was like all (33:51 - 33:55)
black and then yeah red and then it was (33:53 - 33:56)
like crime right it was like super (33:55 - 34:00)
busted because because black emblems are (33:56 - 34:02)
super busted yeah I like if they turned (34:00 - 34:04)
them down a bit they toned them down (34:02 - 34:05)
quite a bit I (34:04 - 34:08)
in a place where if you don't know (34:05 - 34:11)
anything about them you can rank pretty (34:08 - 34:13)
high you can still probably get to (34:11 - 34:15)
veteran and maybe even touch Ultra (34:13 - 34:17)
without ever using emblems but if you (34:15 - 34:20)
want to move past you need to start (34:17 - 34:22)
understanding that system and I think (34:20 - 34:24)
that's equivalent to you can do pretty (34:22 - 34:26)
good in bgcs but you're going to (34:24 - 34:28)
eventually need to learn about IVs and (34:26 - 34:31)
EVS you're going to need to learn how to (34:28 - 34:33)
make this better (34:31 - 34:35)
that's true emblems have the benefit too (34:33 - 34:39)
of they provide a lot of kind of minute (34:35 - 34:41)
stat bonuses inherently but also like (34:39 - 34:44)
the colors are by far uh the more (34:41 - 34:47)
important aspect of the emblem so that (34:44 - 34:49)
system is easy to understand and work (34:47 - 34:51)
with it's just they do have the negative (34:49 - 34:53)
there's a lot of information thrown at (34:51 - 34:54)
you when you're just looking at the (34:53 - 34:56)
layout yeah and oh help you if you're (34:54 - 34:58)
playing on switch trying to assign (34:56 - 35:01)
emblems and get that on the wheel (34:58 - 35:04)
yeah it's I don't know how it's so but I (35:01 - 35:05)
only play on Twitch because I refuse to (35:04 - 35:08)
play on mobile there you go yeah but (35:05 - 35:10)
it's um it's a lot of information to (35:08 - 35:12)
understand but I think Rick I think (35:10 - 35:13)
you're right like there takes (35:12 - 35:15)
um some information that you need to (35:13 - 35:18)
learn elsewhere to try to get better and (35:15 - 35:20)
actually use those systems correctly but (35:18 - 35:23)
I feel like I would play on my iPad if I (35:20 - 35:24)
could hook a controller up to it but (35:23 - 35:26)
they still actually play on my iPad if I (35:24 - 35:27)
could do a controller right they still (35:26 - 35:29)
don't allow that (35:27 - 35:32)
not that I've seen I've seen yeah which (35:29 - 35:34)
is weird (35:32 - 35:37)
I don't know yeah like BlueStacks with (35:34 - 35:38)
the controllers that you're only I'm not (35:37 - 35:41)
recommending it uh but I think that's (35:38 - 35:43)
really the only options but but I I (35:41 - 35:47)
think of the games that I play (35:43 - 35:51)
unite does explain a lot of the stuff (35:47 - 35:53)
up front it does do a bunch of (35:51 - 35:55)
explaining and it does give you helpful (35:53 - 35:58)
things the problem is is they've never (35:55 - 36:01)
fixed the lagginess in their menus (35:58 - 36:03)
and often you will crash in their menus (36:01 - 36:06)
so that can be super frustrating when (36:03 - 36:08)
you're trying to learn something like oh (36:06 - 36:10)
Emma game [ __ ] okay cool (36:08 - 36:12)
I don't think we're the laggiest Pokemon (36:10 - 36:14)
game on the market right now which is (36:12 - 36:16)
pretty exciting (36:14 - 36:19)
um I'm thriving with that so I am happy (36:16 - 36:21)
about that I mean once you're in a match (36:19 - 36:24)
it is pretty smooth Why Try to match is (36:21 - 36:26)
brilliant yeah (36:24 - 36:28)
yeah which is really yeah really really (36:26 - 36:29)
interesting I mean the only problems (36:28 - 36:32)
that people have had is Ping but they've (36:29 - 36:34)
tried to correct that with like their (36:32 - 36:36)
rank systems and the queue times and (36:34 - 36:38)
things like that but that's also a (36:36 - 36:40)
pretty big complaint recently they they (36:38 - 36:41)
changed up the ladder so that there is (36:40 - 36:43)
well not even ladder but they changed up (36:41 - 36:46)
how you queue you can queue up as a one (36:43 - 36:48)
two three player stack or you can queue (36:46 - 36:50)
up as a five I saw that that was that (36:48 - 36:52)
was in itself like oh that seems great (36:50 - 36:54)
like that seems like it was a great step (36:52 - 36:56)
forward I mean it was the way it was (36:54 - 36:58)
before they just didn't tell you right (36:56 - 37:00)
because you could never do rank us for (36:58 - 37:02)
you like why can't I do this then there (37:00 - 37:04)
was nothing in the game I did always (37:02 - 37:07)
feel like if you five stacked and you (37:04 - 37:09)
weren't on comms you were at a (37:07 - 37:11)
disadvantage yeah it's still that way (37:09 - 37:13)
right but like at least they're probably (37:11 - 37:16)
telling you or not visually telling you (37:13 - 37:21)
now yeah answer a problem recently is uh (37:16 - 37:22)
especially in the higher ranks like (37:21 - 37:24)
people who are like closer to 2000 on (37:22 - 37:26)
master and stuff like that is when even (37:24 - 37:29)
if you are duoing or trioing you will (37:26 - 37:32)
often get paired against five Stacks it (37:29 - 37:34)
seems like the game is prioritizing (37:32 - 37:36)
faster queue times and instead of (37:34 - 37:38)
waiting to get you in a balance match (37:36 - 37:40)
and it has really done something (37:38 - 37:42)
terrible with the matchmaking yeah since (37:40 - 37:47)
Pokemon day and it's hard to zacienda (37:42 - 37:51)
yeah since since uh since Z day yeah 30 (37:47 - 37:54)
days from the sashian apocalypse the (37:51 - 37:57)
thing is is that (37:54 - 37:57)
foreign (37:57 - 38:02)
matchmaking they got more transparent (37:59 - 38:04)
about it but somehow it feels a lot (38:02 - 38:06)
worse because we don't understand how (38:04 - 38:07)
their (38:06 - 38:10)
how once they don't find a good match in (38:07 - 38:13)
the first 30 seconds it doesn't seem (38:10 - 38:15)
like they're incrementing it out it just (38:13 - 38:17)
seems like they open the floodgates and (38:15 - 38:20)
you're matched with (38:17 - 38:23)
anybody that they can find which and it (38:20 - 38:25)
also seems that they are somewhat (38:23 - 38:27)
prioritizing that if you're super super (38:25 - 38:29)
good and there's somebody struggling (38:27 - 38:30)
that they're going to try to match you (38:29 - 38:32)
with the struggling person in hopes that (38:30 - 38:35)
you can carry that person (38:32 - 38:38)
um which can be a very very frustrating (38:35 - 38:40)
experience (38:38 - 38:42)
um and so it (38:40 - 38:44)
it's hard to say what's going on with (38:42 - 38:47)
the matchmaking right now other than it (38:44 - 38:49)
everybody started this universe says (38:47 - 38:51)
it's bad again it was good for a little (38:49 - 38:53)
while and now it's like I don't know (38:51 - 38:55)
what we're doing yeah (38:53 - 38:58)
when yeah the season previous zation (38:55 - 38:59)
honestly I think a lot of people said to (38:58 - 39:01)
us right it was one of the best seasons (38:59 - 39:03)
yeah the games had yeah it was really (39:01 - 39:06)
good felt good to play Solo felt good to (39:03 - 39:09)
play in Stacks Pokemon balance there was (39:06 - 39:10)
really strong Pokemon but it felt like (39:09 - 39:12)
there were multiple options out of the (39:10 - 39:14)
very strong Pokemon so I felt he could (39:12 - 39:16)
Flex around a little bit I don't know it (39:14 - 39:18)
was really good and everything changed (39:16 - 39:20)
when Sasha attacked yeah everything (39:18 - 39:22)
happened with the Z day when when you (39:20 - 39:25)
both Play Are You exclusively playing in (39:22 - 39:28)
groups or (39:25 - 39:30)
like ah no one's online so I'm gonna (39:28 - 39:32)
solo cue this (39:30 - 39:35)
50 is so low in groups if people in the (39:32 - 39:39)
ISE group are on and we will match up (39:35 - 39:41)
then I'll play with them and be like (39:39 - 39:42)
let's do but (39:41 - 39:44)
Duos (39:42 - 39:47)
right now are a lot the games are a lot (39:44 - 39:49)
worse than solo queue (39:47 - 39:52)
yeah I exclusively solo queue pretty (39:49 - 39:54)
much I I have friends that can play but (39:52 - 39:57)
I I get in my head about that I don't (39:54 - 39:59)
want to be the reason we lose I don't (39:57 - 40:01)
want to make them my friends lose their (39:59 - 40:03)
games because I didn't play well so I'll (40:01 - 40:05)
honestly mostly play solo queue (40:03 - 40:07)
especially until like I'm in Masters and (40:05 - 40:09)
stuff like that and then I'll start (40:07 - 40:10)
stacking up with people and things like (40:09 - 40:12)
that and that I've got to that point to (40:10 - 40:14)
prove it to myself but for the most part (40:12 - 40:17)
I'll just play solo and honestly this (40:14 - 40:19)
seems like the season two just solo (40:17 - 40:21)
queue so unfortunately I'm I'm honestly (40:19 - 40:24)
having an okay time with it I'm I am (40:21 - 40:25)
enjoying the game when you see zash and (40:24 - 40:27)
comfy on the other side you roll your (40:25 - 40:30)
eyes a little bit but oh one thing we (40:27 - 40:31)
haven't talked about change wise in the (40:30 - 40:34)
game UI is that you can now see your (40:31 - 40:37)
teammates items yeah in the loading (40:34 - 40:40)
screen which is the most definition of a (40:37 - 40:42)
blessing and a curse I've ever seen in a (40:40 - 40:46)
video game I it's amazing you see your (40:42 - 40:47)
friends you see your teammates are (40:46 - 40:48)
stacking you can try to make room for (40:47 - 40:51)
them to stack game but you also see so (40:48 - 40:53)
many leftovers and Rocky helmets it's (40:51 - 40:55)
wild I mean it's good to see like okay (40:53 - 40:57)
you're coming down Lane and you're a (40:55 - 40:59)
stacker cool I need to be aware of that (40:57 - 41:02)
and then I have some clue why you are (40:59 - 41:05)
running away from me as your healer like (41:02 - 41:09)
at Mach 12 I'm like where are you going (41:05 - 41:09)
I think uh going back to like the the (41:10 - 41:15)
solo queue thing I think this is an (41:12 - 41:16)
exclusive to Pokemon unite I think it's (41:15 - 41:20)
exclusive to most competitive games of (41:16 - 41:22)
um like I don't want to group up (41:20 - 41:24)
because I don't want to let my friends (41:22 - 41:26)
down or I don't want I don't want to be (41:24 - 41:30)
the cause of us losing but I think (41:26 - 41:32)
there's on the other side of things like (41:30 - 41:35)
I don't wanna group up and just be (41:32 - 41:37)
carried and like I'm only here because (41:35 - 41:38)
I'm well maybe some people are like I (41:37 - 41:41)
don't care Carry Me (41:38 - 41:44)
yeah but like I remember the first two (41:41 - 41:47)
seasons of unite where I made it to (41:44 - 41:49)
master rank and I solo queued the whole (41:47 - 41:51)
way just because I didn't want anyone to (41:49 - 41:53)
be like well you're only in master rank (41:51 - 41:55)
because somebody carried you oh yeah (41:53 - 41:56)
yeah (41:55 - 42:00)
uh so that's that's a lot of thoughts (41:56 - 42:02)
that strangers have about me that I (42:00 - 42:04)
don't I don't care like I don't care (42:02 - 42:05)
what you think about me I got to Masters (42:04 - 42:09)
rank what are you doing like like the (42:05 - 42:13)
idea that that you can do nothing and be (42:09 - 42:15)
horrible at that game and somehow still (42:13 - 42:18)
be carried to Masters does not match how (42:15 - 42:20)
that game plays (42:18 - 42:22)
like if if you have somebody you have an (42:20 - 42:24)
inactive player it's it feels like (42:22 - 42:27)
impossible to win if you have (42:24 - 42:30)
and this has happened multiple times (42:27 - 42:34)
where at Rayquaza we still have (42:30 - 42:38)
a charmeleon and they have not somehow (42:34 - 42:40)
managed to get to Charizard you are not (42:38 - 42:43)
maybe introduce the Everstone and you (42:40 - 42:46)
just didn't have access to it they I (42:43 - 42:47)
didn't know they had an Avo light that's (42:46 - 42:50)
why yeah I hope it Behavior if you are (42:47 - 42:52)
really bad and cannot pull your weight (42:50 - 42:55)
you will not you will be on a losing (42:52 - 42:57)
streak and you will get into bot matches (42:55 - 43:00)
and you will also lose the bot match (42:57 - 43:05)
right like you do have to be somewhat (43:00 - 43:09)
competent I don't know sometimes (43:05 - 43:09)
yeah I mean boy right matches are but (43:09 - 43:15)
really I feel like losing a pop match is (43:12 - 43:17)
like off close in the game now yeah (43:15 - 43:20)
that's an extreme you turn that yeah (43:17 - 43:23)
from that one I am once I realize I'm in (43:20 - 43:25)
a bot match I will switch to Sarina (43:23 - 43:26)
because I just know I just need to run (43:25 - 43:29)
around and get up to level 15 to have a (43:26 - 43:31)
shot at winning this (43:29 - 43:34)
yeah you're playing team death matches (43:31 - 43:36)
yeah when you're when you're in a pop (43:34 - 43:39)
match that's true but like like I will (43:36 - 43:40)
play I mean I like playing with people (43:39 - 43:43)
simply because I like also to be like (43:40 - 43:45)
did you notice that as well was it me (43:43 - 43:47)
were they just not coming down to fight (43:45 - 43:50)
like I can have another set of eyes to (43:47 - 43:52)
be like what did you see happening there (43:50 - 43:56)
like was it me or did you never see (43:52 - 43:59)
Lucario show up for a team fight ever (43:56 - 44:01)
and it's like no they just were I don't (43:59 - 44:02)
know what they were doing they're doing (44:01 - 44:03)
regular key that's what the internet (44:02 - 44:06)
said so like I like playing with other (44:03 - 44:09)
people but I also like if I don't have (44:06 - 44:10)
other people to play with I'm like I (44:09 - 44:12)
don't have a problem being solo queue I (44:10 - 44:14)
think both have strong benefits and they (44:12 - 44:15)
think (44:14 - 44:18)
I think it is somewhat (44:15 - 44:18)
easy again to be like it's like the (44:19 - 44:24)
thing is like where you don't take stock (44:22 - 44:25)
of your own playing to be like well all (44:24 - 44:27)
my other players were bad I think that's (44:25 - 44:29)
a very easy mindset to get in when (44:27 - 44:32)
you're playing solo queue to be like (44:29 - 44:33)
well that's everybody else's problem (44:32 - 44:36)
that I lost there I I think that is (44:33 - 44:40)
fairly easy to say and sometimes it's (44:36 - 44:42)
true like I played as best as I could I (44:40 - 44:44)
got to level 15 and everybody else was (44:42 - 44:46)
at level 10. like I didn't have a shot (44:44 - 44:48)
at winning that (44:46 - 44:50)
um but I think when you play with other (44:48 - 44:52)
people who also you know like we all (44:50 - 44:55)
have the same idea like we all know we (44:52 - 44:57)
have to rotate down and that doesn't (44:55 - 44:59)
happen with everybody else you have (44:57 - 45:02)
feedback there to be like I was playing (44:59 - 45:04)
the best game that I could and I was let (45:02 - 45:07)
down or I was never where I needed to be (45:04 - 45:09)
like I'll be honest (45:07 - 45:11)
I was over here I don't know what I was (45:09 - 45:14)
doing I was back capping I who knows (45:11 - 45:17)
what I was doing but yeah I was bad (45:14 - 45:18)
um (45:17 - 45:20)
yeah I totally understand that and I (45:18 - 45:22)
said I do play like primarily so lucky (45:20 - 45:24)
for those reasons but on the flip side (45:22 - 45:27)
I've played in plenty of five Stacks as (45:24 - 45:30)
well and that is easily the most fun you (45:27 - 45:31)
can have in the game is is when you have (45:30 - 45:33)
a five stack that you're playing with (45:31 - 45:35)
and you're having a good time like uh (45:33 - 45:37)
with those five of your friends or (45:35 - 45:39)
whatever it is like the coordination (45:37 - 45:41)
that you can have you win or lose that (45:39 - 45:43)
the game will feel so much more exciting (45:41 - 45:45)
and that's what the game is designed to (45:43 - 45:48)
the genre is designed to do as a game (45:45 - 45:49)
right it's supposed to be you know work (45:48 - 45:51)
at your own individual things and then (45:49 - 45:53)
you can come together and have big team (45:51 - 45:54)
fights try to have big coordination (45:53 - 45:57)
things like that it it is a game that (45:54 - 45:59)
excels in that way but a lot of those (45:57 - 46:00)
competitive games do that when they when (45:59 - 46:03)
they stack up to five it's it's a very (46:00 - 46:04)
different game when you're playing solo (46:03 - 46:07)
queue or five stack but I do think the (46:04 - 46:09)
fun is definitely in the area of five (46:07 - 46:10)
six (46:09 - 46:14)
especially if you're all oncomes oh yeah (46:10 - 46:16)
yeah it's not as great (46:14 - 46:19)
yeah man yeah if you're five seconds and (46:16 - 46:20)
not in comms I don't really know why the (46:19 - 46:22)
decision was made to do that but hey if (46:20 - 46:25)
you're if you're doing it just I guess (46:22 - 46:28)
use the Ping system as much as you can (46:25 - 46:31)
so zoinks for you uh you know you you (46:28 - 46:33)
did a lot of commentary you still do (46:31 - 46:35)
commentary uh I think commentating the (46:33 - 46:39)
world championship is is an honor and so (46:35 - 46:41)
absolutely cool (46:39 - 46:44)
um you know how if you were asked to (46:41 - 46:46)
commentate this upcoming worlds in in (46:44 - 46:47)
Japan (46:46 - 46:50)
like are you as excited as you would (46:47 - 46:52)
have been (46:50 - 46:55)
back in August or is is that because of (46:52 - 46:57)
the changes to the game (46:55 - 46:59)
oh I'd be way more excited I've actually (46:57 - 47:02)
okay I've talked about this a few times (46:59 - 47:04)
on a couple of podcasts or streamers (47:02 - 47:06)
channels but we're in a weird spot in (47:04 - 47:08)
the competitive side of things because I (47:06 - 47:11)
think the competitive meta is amazing (47:08 - 47:13)
right now I I genuinely think the game (47:11 - 47:16)
at a competitive level is so exciting (47:13 - 47:19)
one sashan's banned still uh not allowed (47:16 - 47:21)
in the game so that's one part of it but (47:19 - 47:23)
for our listeners competitive meta just (47:21 - 47:25)
different than ranked (47:23 - 47:27)
yeah different than right yeah exactly (47:25 - 47:29)
because in tournament mode or in draft (47:27 - 47:32)
mode you play with draft uh so both (47:29 - 47:35)
teams get one band uh it's made on a (47:32 - 47:37)
voting basis it's simultaneous so you (47:35 - 47:39)
don't know what the other team's Banning (47:37 - 47:40)
uh but you've both launched up one band (47:39 - 47:42)
both of those Pokemon neither side are (47:40 - 47:44)
allowed to pick that Pokemon then you go (47:42 - 47:46)
back and forth choosing Pokemon to add (47:44 - 47:48)
to your team (47:46 - 47:50)
um draft mode has made this game really (47:48 - 47:52)
really exciting yeah and the balance (47:50 - 47:53)
that's there is really good like there's (47:52 - 47:55)
two Defenders that are just sort of the (47:53 - 47:57)
best defenders in the game right now but (47:55 - 47:59)
since there's two you can give up one (47:57 - 48:00)
and grab the other or you could try to (47:59 - 48:03)
grab both and give up a Healer on your (48:00 - 48:05)
team instead build double tank like (48:03 - 48:07)
there's a lot of really cool options the (48:05 - 48:08)
defender assignment question are (48:07 - 48:10)
Trevenant and Slowbro they are yeah (48:08 - 48:12)
unbelievably good yeah very good tree is (48:10 - 48:15)
so good right now I love tree whatever (48:12 - 48:17)
is it's something else it'll pull you (48:15 - 48:19)
back from Narnia into in front of it and (48:17 - 48:21)
slam you down but it is a group of but I (48:19 - 48:24)
do think the competitive game (48:21 - 48:26)
um in tournament format and draft and (48:24 - 48:29)
everything is at an awesome place and (48:26 - 48:30)
I'm really excited to see global (48:29 - 48:32)
competition so I'm even more excited for (48:30 - 48:34)
worlds because first worlds we didn't (48:32 - 48:36)
have draft mode in the game which was (48:34 - 48:38)
fine we had like different regions (48:36 - 48:39)
showcasing different strategies and (48:38 - 48:42)
stuff and that that is exciting it's (48:39 - 48:43)
just (48:42 - 48:44)
I don't know once you started seeing the (48:43 - 48:46)
games we got later on in the tournaments (48:44 - 48:48)
like okay one strategy is definitely (48:46 - 48:51)
better than these other ones and okay (48:48 - 48:52)
well I guess we'll see who wins out of (48:51 - 48:55)
those in the finals but I am I am very (48:52 - 48:58)
excited to see uh to see drafts and (48:55 - 49:00)
tournament going forward I mean with (48:58 - 49:03)
with worlds and unite there was no draft (49:00 - 49:05)
mode but there was still unique picks (49:03 - 49:08)
that like oh yeah twitch chat or YouTube (49:05 - 49:10)
chat would like lose their minds about (49:08 - 49:13)
like I think sejin was playing greed it (49:10 - 49:16)
and people would yes like very excited (49:13 - 49:18)
to see sejin play greed and there was a (49:16 - 49:20)
there was a cram ramp player and I (49:18 - 49:21)
remember watching that person be like (49:20 - 49:25)
I've I've been I have 2 000 matches of (49:21 - 49:26)
Cramer and I don't I didn't know he (49:25 - 49:30)
could do that like he's moving so fast (49:26 - 49:32)
[Laughter] (49:30 - 49:35)
yeah Japan yeah Japan brought a lot of (49:32 - 49:38)
fun things bro kramarand Japan loves (49:35 - 49:40)
playing Aegis slash bottom path they (49:38 - 49:42)
that is like one of the things that (49:40 - 49:44)
every team there likes to play uh (49:42 - 49:46)
they consider it very strong and it is a (49:44 - 49:48)
fun exciting Pokemon to watch I mean (49:46 - 49:50)
white guard's a cool button when used at (49:48 - 49:53)
uh at correct time so the regional (49:50 - 49:55)
identities were a lot of fun um we (49:53 - 49:56)
unfortunately didn't get to see a lot of (49:55 - 49:58)
the South American teams (49:56 - 50:00)
um uh visas weren't able to be required (49:58 - 50:02)
acquired in time for to get to London (50:00 - 50:04)
from certain countries and so I was (50:02 - 50:05)
really excited to watch some South (50:04 - 50:07)
American gameplay we got to see Brazil (50:05 - 50:09)
but other than that we didn't get to see (50:07 - 50:12)
and they were um if there's ever a (50:09 - 50:14)
region that would flip objectives faster (50:12 - 50:16)
than the other it was it was South (50:14 - 50:18)
America they were in with Zapdos (50:16 - 50:19)
immediately I have a lot of really (50:18 - 50:22)
exciting games from them so I I wanted (50:19 - 50:23)
to see some gameplay hopefully for year (50:22 - 50:26)
two we get to see some more yeah no it (50:23 - 50:31)
seems like part of this podcast is like (50:26 - 50:34)
why people want to get back into unite (50:31 - 50:36)
where people put you knife on unite on (50:34 - 50:38)
the shelf and then you know when you (50:36 - 50:40)
hear everything negative around zashian (50:38 - 50:43)
and the recent changes of the map it's (50:40 - 50:45)
like well is this game in a good place (50:43 - 50:46)
but then there's like this whole other (50:45 - 50:48)
side of the game which is like (50:46 - 50:51)
high level competitive play that when (50:48 - 50:53)
you watch it you're like man this is so (50:51 - 50:54)
exciting why is everyone else saying (50:53 - 50:57)
that this game is broken or busted and (50:54 - 50:58)
it's like almost (50:57 - 51:00)
two different games (50:58 - 51:03)
really well and I I wouldn't say like (51:00 - 51:05)
like the zashian (51:03 - 51:07)
problem doesn't happen in every match (51:05 - 51:10)
it's not like I always run into zashian (51:07 - 51:13)
yeah um you just know that when azashian (51:10 - 51:15)
appears you are going to have to (51:13 - 51:18)
prioritize not allowing that sashian to (51:15 - 51:21)
level right like it it becomes a (51:18 - 51:23)
kilzashian mission more than anything (51:21 - 51:24)
else (51:23 - 51:26)
um and I think like overall I think the (51:24 - 51:27)
game (51:26 - 51:31)
up you know those Asian thing hit and it (51:27 - 51:33)
everybody who's played the game for a (51:31 - 51:35)
long time is still feeling it right (51:33 - 51:37)
we're like this thing is is broken and (51:35 - 51:42)
we know it needs to be fixed but I think (51:37 - 51:44)
if you get into the game and start (51:42 - 51:46)
playing ranked matches like you're gonna (51:44 - 51:48)
get pretty far before you run into (51:46 - 51:51)
competent zashian players there's a lot (51:48 - 51:52)
of people just don't know how to play it (51:51 - 51:54)
and at that point it's like any other (51:52 - 51:56)
character that somebody doesn't know how (51:54 - 51:58)
to play it's just not like they think oh (51:56 - 52:00)
this is my win condition but they don't (51:58 - 52:02)
know how to use it appropriately so what (52:00 - 52:04)
I'm hearing is you play Hershey Foo you (52:02 - 52:06)
hit the wicked blow you can play you can (52:04 - 52:08)
play one person I did play I did get a (52:06 - 52:10)
rental for Hershey food out of the (52:08 - 52:11)
current thing and I'm like oh this is (52:10 - 52:13)
kind of fun it's just not my play style (52:11 - 52:16)
yeah like I find (52:13 - 52:18)
um cinderay so incredibly easy to play (52:16 - 52:19)
and I'm like I find Cinder is kind of (52:18 - 52:22)
boring so I don't play it it's it was (52:19 - 52:24)
interesting like one button pyro ball (52:22 - 52:26)
and then just kick kick camera on the (52:24 - 52:29)
screen yeah (52:26 - 52:29)
uh and I think it's like (52:30 - 52:36)
I think you can have a ton of fun (52:33 - 52:39)
depending on what you want to get out of (52:36 - 52:42)
unite I think it is a great game I think (52:39 - 52:44)
overall it is in a very good place I (52:42 - 52:47)
think that those of us who come those of (52:44 - 52:50)
us who complain about the Brokers are (52:47 - 52:52)
people who are playing at the top or (52:50 - 52:54)
near the top level like I've hit Masters (52:52 - 52:56)
every season (52:54 - 52:57)
um Masters is (52:56 - 53:00)
tough to get to depending on this he's (52:57 - 53:02)
into depending how you're playing (53:00 - 53:04)
um you know like last season it felt (53:02 - 53:05)
really balanced this season it felt like (53:04 - 53:07)
I will never get there and then you get (53:05 - 53:09)
there you're like hooray now I don't (53:07 - 53:11)
have to necessarily pay ranked again for (53:09 - 53:13)
a while because I need a break but I (53:11 - 53:15)
think if you are playing any of the (53:13 - 53:17)
other modes you're going to have a lot (53:15 - 53:18)
of fun like (53:17 - 53:22)
brass rush for as weird as it is can be (53:18 - 53:25)
tremendous amounts of fun just don't do (53:22 - 53:27)
extreme unless you have a group of (53:25 - 53:28)
people with you like you can't do (53:27 - 53:31)
extreme with randoms you just can't but (53:28 - 53:34)
casual intermediate totally fun (53:31 - 53:37)
um Ketchum mode totally fun quick (53:34 - 53:39)
battles they're five minutes they're fun (53:37 - 53:41)
they're fast you could try a bunch of (53:39 - 53:43)
different things out emblems make almost (53:41 - 53:45)
no difference there because you go (53:43 - 53:48)
through that game so fast (53:45 - 53:48)
um (53:48 - 53:51)
there's a lot of fun to be had in the (53:48 - 53:54)
game without touching the complex nature (53:51 - 53:55)
of it and I think that's one of the (53:54 - 53:59)
things that the community around Unite (53:55 - 54:02)
and around a lot of mobas suffer from is (53:59 - 54:05)
that you only hear from people who play (54:02 - 54:08)
ranks who are pushing for ranked who are (54:05 - 54:11)
really trying to play a very competitive (54:08 - 54:14)
game and that is just the way it is for (54:11 - 54:15)
a lot of games like a lot of people (54:14 - 54:17)
might think I never want to do bgcs (54:15 - 54:20)
because I hear of the stresses of top (54:17 - 54:22)
BGC players where it's like you don't (54:20 - 54:24)
have to strive for that level you can (54:22 - 54:27)
just do it and have fun and if you want (54:24 - 54:31)
to strive you can (54:27 - 54:33)
um and there are now what there's 50 (54:31 - 54:35)
Pokemon now (54:33 - 54:38)
in unite yeah Goodra was the 50th (54:35 - 54:41)
and then we have (54:38 - 54:44)
Lapras which I've watched and I don't (54:41 - 54:46)
get it I don't understand it's the (54:44 - 54:48)
goofiest it's the goofiest thing and it (54:46 - 54:50)
makes me laugh (54:48 - 54:52)
Umbreon is coming and chandelier is (54:50 - 54:56)
coming and then at some point it is (54:52 - 54:57)
rumored that we'll be getting at least (54:56 - 54:59)
two more Eevee evolutions so you can (54:57 - 55:02)
have an all EB team five players all (54:59 - 55:04)
playing different side note though like (55:02 - 55:06)
if there's if there's a group of Pokemon (55:04 - 55:09)
that brings players back it's it's yeah (55:06 - 55:12)
EVs and Umbreon (55:09 - 55:14)
Umbreon especially that's gonna be a (55:12 - 55:16)
slam dunk because we are getting because (55:14 - 55:20)
then we'll have Espeon Sylveon (55:16 - 55:20)
Umbreon and (55:20 - 55:27)
Glaceon Glacier and then the rumor the (55:23 - 55:31)
rumor is Leafeon is next yeah (55:27 - 55:34)
and then they're saving Jolteon for some (55:31 - 55:36)
special day because that's that's gonna (55:34 - 55:39)
be like we'll get those seven players (55:36 - 55:42)
who love Jolteon Flair I'm just gonna be (55:39 - 55:44)
wild Pokemon let's face it it's just (55:42 - 55:48)
gonna be Farm on the new map unfortunate (55:44 - 55:48)
um and I think (55:48 - 55:54)
so for a while there I felt like they (55:51 - 55:57)
were just putting out Pokemon that had a (55:54 - 55:58)
mix and match of already existing moves (55:57 - 56:00)
and that was the way it was for a while (55:58 - 56:02)
and since Zoroark had stabilized they (56:00 - 56:04)
have been starting to carefully (56:02 - 56:07)
introduce new mechanics that play (56:04 - 56:09)
slightly different (56:07 - 56:10)
um and I think that's been very exciting (56:09 - 56:13)
gudra has been very exciting (56:10 - 56:17)
um I think urshifu I get I think well (56:13 - 56:18)
when seizure came up was like you have (56:17 - 56:21)
split Evolutions that was like what yeah (56:18 - 56:25)
what do you mean (56:21 - 56:27)
um so I think those things have been (56:25 - 56:30)
very exciting additions to to play with (56:27 - 56:32)
in the game (56:30 - 56:34)
there's also a point where (56:32 - 56:36)
um I mean I'm sure Pro players are high (56:34 - 56:40)
level players know this and maybe (56:36 - 56:42)
if somebody's listening and thinking (56:40 - 56:44)
about it and I could be wrong so you two (56:42 - 56:45)
can correct me but I think there's (56:44 - 56:47)
there's a point where a Pokemon you play (56:45 - 56:50)
auto wins against other Pokemon but then (56:47 - 56:52)
Otto loses to other Pokemon and when I (56:50 - 56:53)
you know before there was 50 characters (56:52 - 56:55)
I felt like if (56:53 - 56:58)
as a crameran player if I saw Lucario I (56:55 - 57:01)
could barely ever win that 1v1 (56:58 - 57:03)
um so but if I saw (57:01 - 57:05)
you know a cinderace and I was close (57:03 - 57:07)
enough I always win that 1v1 (57:05 - 57:10)
um yeah so yeah now that there's like 50 (57:07 - 57:13)
it feels like if you're buzzwole I don't (57:10 - 57:14)
know if anyone's playing buzzwall you (57:13 - 57:18)
probably will also get some play yeah (57:14 - 57:18)
Buzz Ball's little weird late life (57:18 - 57:23)
animation which is creepy it's (57:21 - 57:24)
terrifying but everything about that (57:23 - 57:27)
Pokemon is creepy so they're just sort (57:24 - 57:29)
of Leaning into it I think I I think (57:27 - 57:32)
there are still match-ups you know like (57:29 - 57:35)
for an attacker like if you see a (57:32 - 57:36)
decision why everybody knows getting (57:35 - 57:39)
close because it is going to crumple if (57:36 - 57:41)
you can get in close the thing that they (57:39 - 57:44)
change is so I can get out fast now like (57:41 - 57:46)
this is why I can flee pretty quick (57:44 - 57:48)
because I know but like you begin to (57:46 - 57:50)
learn the things like oh I'm up against (57:48 - 57:54)
the Snorlax I will wait for it to do its (57:50 - 57:56)
shield and then I will go behind it and (57:54 - 57:59)
then take it down like you begin to (57:56 - 58:02)
learn how to deal with them yeah (57:59 - 58:04)
um and I I don't think I think the (58:02 - 58:06)
balance is good enough that you'll still (58:04 - 58:08)
be like attackers can't hold up against (58:06 - 58:12)
all rounders like attackers are (58:08 - 58:14)
more (58:12 - 58:16)
glass canony for by Design and all (58:14 - 58:18)
rounders have better stamina to survive (58:16 - 58:20)
that like you're going to run into that (58:18 - 58:22)
problem but (58:20 - 58:24)
um there are way more Escape mechanisms (58:22 - 58:27)
now like eject button is still pretty (58:24 - 58:31)
popular uh the speed one which I posted (58:27 - 58:32)
took over the meta (58:31 - 58:35)
oh boy (58:32 - 58:35)
I don't know (58:35 - 58:41)
um so like (58:39 - 58:44)
with as many choices that there are now (58:41 - 58:47)
matches also don't feel so say me say me (58:44 - 58:49)
anymore that is really true yeah variety (58:47 - 58:52)
feels that like an all-time high for the (58:49 - 58:53)
game yeah (58:52 - 58:55)
like and we even have talked about how (58:53 - 58:57)
strong the sashing combo with with (58:55 - 59:01)
confit can be but it's it's not like you (58:57 - 59:03)
mentioned it's not in every game like (59:01 - 59:05)
people are wanting to try something else (59:03 - 59:08)
as well and so uh I feel like there is a (59:05 - 59:10)
lot more variety to the game you're not (59:08 - 59:12)
just seeing something and being like all (59:10 - 59:13)
right well we just we lose this one (59:12 - 59:16)
because of this so I don't know if it's (59:13 - 59:18)
Unique to Masters but it's like once (59:16 - 59:19)
people get to Masters they're like well (59:18 - 59:21)
I've made it here and now I can play (59:19 - 59:23)
right now I can play with other things I (59:21 - 59:25)
can do other Pokemon because I've made (59:23 - 59:27)
it to the rank I want to be I mean that (59:25 - 59:29)
that is a VGC thing too you make it to (59:27 - 59:31)
master rank and you're like I Cannot (59:29 - 59:34)
drop below I'm stuck I'm in master rank (59:31 - 59:35)
now so what what my number doesn't (59:34 - 59:37)
matter anymore like I I just wanted the (59:35 - 59:41)
rewards I'll I'll play Noctowl or (59:37 - 59:43)
whatever right (59:41 - 59:47)
um yeah I mean it it's it's interesting (59:43 - 59:48)
like (59:47 - 59:50)
with so many Pokemon now like you will (59:48 - 59:52)
see when the new things Drop Like I Do I (59:50 - 59:55)
run into Goodra a lot currently because (59:52 - 59:58)
it's the new one and they actually have (59:55 - 60:02)
they have a reward system that says if (59:58 - 60:04)
you've played the current Pokemon that (60:02 - 60:06)
was just released you get an extra draw (60:04 - 60:09)
of our prizes so please play Goodra (60:06 - 60:12)
um and so people are (60:09 - 60:14)
um but I I think (60:12 - 60:18)
the more Pokemon that are added (60:14 - 60:21)
the the less you feel like I'm always (60:18 - 60:24)
going to run into my Nemesis in this (60:21 - 60:26)
matchup (60:24 - 60:28)
yeah that's true I think there's still (60:26 - 60:30)
some Pokemon that are hard to play in A (60:28 - 60:32)
ranked environment when you it's not (60:30 - 60:34)
draft so you have no idea what the enemy (60:32 - 60:35)
is picking (60:34 - 60:37)
um Tyranitar is a is like an option like (60:35 - 60:40)
that that Pokemon is amazing into some (60:37 - 60:42)
team compositions and then just folds to (60:40 - 60:45)
some others so that's a that's a tough (60:42 - 60:47)
one but yeah I think for the most part (60:45 - 60:49)
you'll find some good options yeah I (60:47 - 60:50)
mean the thing that was trying to tire (60:49 - 60:51)
is when everybody sees It's like Star (60:50 - 60:54)
Tyranitar because if you can prevent it (60:51 - 60:57)
from getting to become t-tar (60:54 - 61:01)
it's it is next to impossible to play (60:57 - 61:03)
like everybody's like oh just star (61:01 - 61:05)
petard do not let t-tar level track it (61:03 - 61:08)
down and steal everything from it (61:05 - 61:11)
because it can't hold its own (61:08 - 61:13)
until it becomes t-tar and then it (61:11 - 61:16)
becomes a menace it's also the Gardevoir (61:13 - 61:18)
problem it's like star of Gardevoir (61:16 - 61:21)
yeah one of the easiest Pokemon to (61:18 - 61:24)
invade the central is when garden war is (61:21 - 61:25)
when his garden was hanging out there (61:24 - 61:28)
but yeah okay so not to go too long but (61:25 - 61:31)
uh I think we can end on this note is (61:28 - 61:35)
uh what is the one Pokemon you wanted to (61:31 - 61:39)
be added to the game and then uh one (61:35 - 61:41)
like the this could be a step two so two (61:39 - 61:43)
Pokemon one Pokemon you won't be added (61:41 - 61:45)
and then what gen nine Pokemon do you (61:43 - 61:46)
want to be added (61:45 - 61:48)
because like they're they have to make a (61:46 - 61:50)
big deal about like adding a gen 9 (61:48 - 61:53)
Pokemon they haven't done it yet yeah (61:50 - 61:53)
I mean we know mine my all-arounder I (61:54 - 61:59)
want to play my Rosalia and I want to (61:57 - 62:00)
play it forever and never level it and (61:59 - 62:02)
be like I'm just gonna hang out as a (62:00 - 62:04)
rose in the middle and don't you think (62:02 - 62:05)
it would be an all-around or nothing (62:04 - 62:07)
around here Rosalia no I'm just saying I (62:05 - 62:09)
would just never evolve to a rosaries (62:07 - 62:11)
I'd be like I'm just saying yes (62:09 - 62:12)
[Music] (62:11 - 62:15)
I'm not helping not attacker you'd want (62:12 - 62:17)
it to be all around her no I would I (62:15 - 62:18)
don't care what it would be I would (62:17 - 62:21)
imagine it'd be support or it could be (62:18 - 62:22)
speed (62:21 - 62:23)
because (62:22 - 62:27)
Rosary in the games is pretty fast (62:23 - 62:29)
um obviously I either want tinkerton or (62:27 - 62:31)
brex caliber from (62:29 - 62:34)
jed9 they the backscalibur seems like an (62:31 - 62:35)
easy thing since they love pseudo (62:34 - 62:37)
dragons and you know yeah it's kind of (62:35 - 62:39)
like very apparent now (62:37 - 62:41)
I do love those pseudo drives I'm (62:39 - 62:42)
surprised we haven't gotten like (62:41 - 62:45)
salamance yet oh there's no way he's not (62:42 - 62:47)
coming right oh yeah or Metagross like (62:45 - 62:49)
that's actually a shocker to me is no (62:47 - 62:51)
Medicare yes it's yeah like the (62:49 - 62:54)
professor has a Metagross in the game (62:51 - 62:56)
but like in the game of unite like the (62:54 - 62:58)
whatever Islands Professor that's their (62:56 - 63:00)
Pokemon but we still don't have meta (62:58 - 63:02)
girl so it feels strange but (63:00 - 63:05)
um my pick for Pokemon I want a uh I (63:02 - 63:08)
want duskenorm as a Defender that's one (63:05 - 63:10)
thing I've always pitched (63:08 - 63:11)
um Sableye has this mechanic it's the (63:10 - 63:12)
first one to have it in the game is a (63:11 - 63:15)
mechanical fear but basically the (63:12 - 63:16)
opposite of something like huge arm like (63:15 - 63:17)
you drop an area of effects and Pokemon (63:16 - 63:19)
have to move away from it I think it (63:17 - 63:21)
doesn't be a very cool fear-based (63:19 - 63:24)
Defender I have a scary face and things (63:21 - 63:26)
like that uh gen 9 I think I think (63:24 - 63:28)
Armory Sarah ledge dual Evolution from (63:26 - 63:31)
sharkinet would be that would be cool is (63:28 - 63:33)
he like bitter Blade armor Cannon and (63:31 - 63:34)
you choose one of those options and that (63:33 - 63:36)
chooses what it evolves into I think (63:34 - 63:38)
would be I think would be amazing I (63:36 - 63:39)
think that Pokemon would be so fun to (63:38 - 63:40)
play (63:39 - 63:42)
attacker or Speedster would kind of be (63:40 - 63:43)
the two options you could go into (63:42 - 63:46)
whereas like scissors like uh all around (63:43 - 63:50)
her or Speedster so I think it'd be fun (63:46 - 63:54)
um I would like to see Draco wish (63:50 - 63:57)
wow okay (63:54 - 64:00)
uh I I think he's incredibly funny I (63:57 - 64:02)
think he takes advantage of like you (64:00 - 64:04)
know current surf mechanics (64:02 - 64:06)
um so that would be like the the (64:04 - 64:08)
standard thing like I'm assuming (64:06 - 64:10)
Fisher's Rend would be very similar to (64:08 - 64:13)
how like a surf would work (64:10 - 64:17)
um but obviously some sort of new twist (64:13 - 64:19)
I could see dracovish as a Speedster you (64:17 - 64:20)
ever watched the anime that dude is (64:19 - 64:23)
zooming that dude runs he is running in (64:20 - 64:25)
the anime (64:23 - 64:28)
um for Gen 9 I I think for me it's (64:25 - 64:29)
golden go (64:28 - 64:31)
yeah like and I feel like they would (64:29 - 64:33)
probably make a big deal about that (64:31 - 64:36)
um but they gave the mechanic to zashin (64:33 - 64:38)
already I feel like that was just (64:36 - 64:40)
written for Golden go like use your EOS (64:38 - 64:43)
energy to do big attacks and then they (64:40 - 64:46)
gave it to zashi instead of golden go (64:43 - 64:48)
having it make it rain it would be very (64:46 - 64:51)
very perfect for that uh-huh (64:48 - 64:53)
I don't know maybe Golden Goat would (64:51 - 64:55)
have something where when golden go (64:53 - 64:59)
knocks it out more a.s gems drop so it (64:55 - 65:01)
would be like oh don't let like oh he's (64:59 - 65:03)
weak golden ghost should be the one that (65:01 - 65:05)
knocks us out or not but that would be (65:03 - 65:07)
like really hard to coordinate yeah (65:05 - 65:10)
that would be like a golden snitch Style (65:07 - 65:13)
on the battlefield all right I like it (65:10 - 65:15)
cool (65:13 - 65:18)
cool well um thanks for making it to the (65:15 - 65:21)
