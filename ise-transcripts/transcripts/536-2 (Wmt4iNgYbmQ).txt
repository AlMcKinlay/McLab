bye you're kicked out of the lodge I'm (1:06 - 1:11)
talking to different people two I've (1:08 - 1:14)
officially reached the dread part of my (1:11 - 1:17)
excitement for scarlet and violet (1:14 - 1:19)
The Dread part yeah the part where the (1:17 - 1:22)
sinking dread of what if it's horrible (1:19 - 1:24)
what if I hate it more than the hn2 has (1:22 - 1:26)
set in (1:24 - 1:29)
as the natural evidence (1:26 - 1:32)
no it's just because anytime I'm excited (1:29 - 1:34)
for everything right as it gets close to (1:32 - 1:37)
it coming out my brain's like (1:34 - 1:38)
what if it's bad (1:37 - 1:41)
and then the dread comes in and then I (1:38 - 1:43)
work through my dread before I get to (1:41 - 1:45)
the game or whatever I'm watching so (1:43 - 1:48)
that I'm in the acceptance phase and I (1:45 - 1:51)
can just enjoy what happens I get to (1:48 - 1:54)
dread out early and we're there right (1:51 - 1:57)
now we are in full scarlet and violet (1:54 - 1:59)
dread mode yeah the thing you have to (1:57 - 2:02)
try to meditate on is worrying about the (1:59 - 2:05)
future neither change is the future nor (2:02 - 2:08)
makes today any better so just focus on (2:05 - 2:09)
the now (2:08 - 2:12)

are you talking about uh two weeks ago I (4:34 - 4:39)
went to New York uh in Nintendo and the (4:37 - 4:41)
Pokemon company invited me out uh I (4:39 - 4:44)
played an hour of (4:41 - 4:47)
um Pokemon Scarlet Pokemon violet (4:44 - 4:49)
and then I asked them a bunch of (4:47 - 4:50)
questions and they said this is what (4:49 - 4:51)
you're allowed to talk about this is not (4:50 - 4:52)
what you're allowed to talk about and (4:51 - 4:54)
then I did a 90 minute episode (4:52 - 4:57)
uh with Greg and will and they were the (4:54 - 4:59)
uh the audience of like (4:57 - 5:00)
these are the questions I have and I (4:59 - 5:02)
answered them the best I could I will (5:00 - 5:05)
say a funny thing that happened as I had (5:02 - 5:06)
to like go back because there was like (5:05 - 5:08)
three times that Greg was like ah this (5:06 - 5:11)
game sounds zero out of ten this is my (5:08 - 5:12)
phone this is not Greg's fault but one (5:11 - 5:14)
of the very strict rules in the contract (5:12 - 5:16)
I signed was like you are not allowed to (5:14 - 5:18)
give this game a score (5:16 - 5:20)
I mean that's not a score (5:18 - 5:23)
it's just nothing it's a zero funny (5:20 - 5:25)
thing that happened Captain clickbait (5:23 - 5:29)
named the video we played Pokemon (5:25 - 5:32)
scarlet and we we did nothing did (5:29 - 5:36)
nothing we sat and listened to you talk (5:32 - 5:39)
about a thing you did without us we (5:36 - 5:41)
sounds better than I (5:39 - 5:43)
no it doesn't it's falsely advertised (5:41 - 5:45)
against clickbait do you know what's (5:43 - 5:46)
actually clickbait you know what's (5:45 - 5:48)
actually unreal (5:46 - 5:50)
uh I did I did what I did use the word (5:48 - 5:52)
we as in like there's three of us and (5:50 - 5:53)
there was like an open conversation (5:52 - 5:54)
there (5:53 - 5:55)
um but yeah I could understand how (5:54 - 5:57)
that's clickbait do you know what's (5:55 - 5:59)
actually clickbait though was that I saw (5:57 - 6:03)
uh the amount of other (5:59 - 6:06)
creators say that they played two hours (6:03 - 6:09)
like I said I did see that yeah and then (6:06 - 6:12)
I saw one ambitious enough to say I (6:09 - 6:16)
played over two hours like why why is (6:12 - 6:19)
that why why did that lie need to be (6:16 - 6:23)
told like you could just say you played (6:19 - 6:25)
scarlet and violet I don't think anyone (6:23 - 6:26)
is looking at two different YouTube (6:25 - 6:28)
videos and be like oh this this person (6:26 - 6:30)
said they played Scotland Violet but (6:28 - 6:32)
this person said they played over time (6:30 - 6:35)
how did they justify saying when you (6:32 - 6:37)
were put at an hour time limit because (6:35 - 6:40)
the the meeting was two hours long I (6:37 - 6:42)
think is the how they're trying to like (6:40 - 6:45)
like when I got to the meeting they like (6:42 - 6:47)
lined us all up and then there was this (6:45 - 6:49)
very nice lady and she was like I'm the (6:47 - 6:51)
Pokemon Expert here this is my job at (6:49 - 6:54)
Nintendo and here is the here I am (6:51 - 6:56)
reading you the NDA these are the things (6:54 - 6:59)
you are not allowed to talk about and (6:56 - 7:00)
then like she was excited too she was (6:59 - 7:01)
like I can't wait for you to experience (7:00 - 7:03)
like Mela and she's like can't wait for (7:01 - 7:05)
you to experience the gym leader like (7:03 - 7:07)
that whole segment of (7:05 - 7:09)
getting there waiting for like a couple (7:07 - 7:11)
people were light (7:09 - 7:13)
um signing the NDA that was like the (7:11 - 7:16)
first half hour uh of the appointment (7:13 - 7:19)
and then they sat us down and we played (7:16 - 7:20)
for an hour and they they were timing us (7:19 - 7:22)
they were like hey you guys got 20 (7:20 - 7:23)
minutes left hey you guys got 10 minutes (7:22 - 7:25)
left and then when it was done (7:23 - 7:27)
um they had us all like go back to like (7:25 - 7:30)
the mingling area and then they were (7:27 - 7:32)
setting up the Raid Battle (7:30 - 7:35)
and uh we went back and The Raid Battle (7:32 - 7:37)
couldn't be more than 10 minutes because (7:35 - 7:39)
there's a 10 minute timer on The Raid (7:37 - 7:42)
Battle uh we did The Raid Battle and (7:39 - 7:43)
then they had us put down our (7:42 - 7:44)
controllers and then they were like okay (7:43 - 7:46)
well do you have any other questions or (7:44 - 7:48)
concerns (7:46 - 7:49)
um (7:48 - 7:51)
and that was that was the whole two (7:49 - 7:53)
hours and then they promptly kicked us (7:51 - 7:56)
out because they had to like rotate in (7:53 - 7:59)
the next group of four uh people because (7:56 - 8:00)
it was a (7:59 - 8:03)
four people and then (8:00 - 8:05)
rotate out four people rotate out four (8:03 - 8:07)
people they had snacks I didn't say that (8:05 - 8:10)
they had like a they had like uh like uh (8:07 - 8:12)
fancy sodas like sodas and glass bottles (8:10 - 8:15)
that you I didn't have any I I get very (8:12 - 8:18)
nervous at these like events I know that (8:15 - 8:21)
it's like corporate corporations throw a (8:18 - 8:23)
bunch of money and they like have like a (8:21 - 8:25)
like a refreshment area but I always get (8:23 - 8:26)
like I don't know I always feel like (8:25 - 8:28)
somebody's judging me if I go over and I (8:26 - 8:33)
grab like what what what school luncheon (8:28 - 8:36)
hurt you that you have the option to (8:33 - 8:40)
take fancy New York sodas and you don't (8:36 - 8:43)
even take one what was the Brandy (8:40 - 8:45)
because I and I will say two things and (8:43 - 8:48)
this is probably the Gen xer in me (8:45 - 8:50)
saying this let's make this clear (8:48 - 8:52)
multiple times the Gen extra in me (8:50 - 8:55)
saying this number one when you left (8:52 - 8:58)
somebody from Nintendo said well I guess (8:55 - 9:00)
we shouldn't have wasted so much money (8:58 - 9:02)
yeah on snacks because they're too good (9:00 - 9:05)
for ours yes they wouldn't touch our (9:02 - 9:07)
snacks and number two which is not that (9:05 - 9:10)
you because clearly you were on time if (9:07 - 9:13)
Mr Nintendo 15 minutes early to their (9:10 - 9:18)
office you show up on time and by on (9:13 - 9:21)
time I mean at least a half an hour (9:18 - 9:23)
before your scheduled appointment okay (9:21 - 9:24)
you know it was really you know what was (9:23 - 9:26)
really bad is I was so nervous about (9:24 - 9:28)
this entire meeting that I got there an (9:26 - 9:30)
hour early and I just walked around the (9:28 - 9:33)
block over and over again I would do (9:30 - 9:36)
that I would find a place to go sit (9:33 - 9:39)
nearby and be like I'm peacing out and (9:36 - 9:41)
doing doing that but it's in New York (9:39 - 9:43)
City nobody sits in New York City yeah (9:41 - 9:46)
everybody sits in New York City what are (9:43 - 9:49)
you talking about over here I did I I (9:46 - 9:52)
was walking around it was in America (9:49 - 9:56)
it wasn't like a businessy more it was (9:52 - 9:57)
oh wait will might know where this is it (9:56 - 10:00)
was it was like a street over from Korea (9:57 - 10:02)
Town although Korea Town I think is like (10:00 - 10:04)
a single Street in New York (10:02 - 10:07)
what I've never been to a Korea Town (10:04 - 10:09)
Korea did not exist when I was living (10:07 - 10:12)
yeah they didn't come in until after the (10:09 - 10:13)
80s (10:12 - 10:17)
um so I I yeah you know will makes a (10:13 - 10:18)
good point I I walked up 15 minutes (10:17 - 10:20)
early and they were like wow you're here (10:18 - 10:23)
already and I was like well yeah uh but (10:20 - 10:25)
yeah the uh the other well we my (10:23 - 10:26)
appointment my appointment had one (10:25 - 10:30)
no-show they canceled they canceled on (10:26 - 10:33)
Mr Nintendo uh and then there was (10:30 - 10:34)
another person that was like five (10:33 - 10:36)
minutes late uh I don't know what gaming (10:34 - 10:39)
Outlet he was not a content creator uh (10:36 - 10:41)
so again maybe some behind the scenes (10:39 - 10:42)
here (10:41 - 10:44)
Nintendo was said said this was the (10:42 - 10:46)
first time they've brought content (10:44 - 10:48)
creators in for something like this and (10:46 - 10:52)
that this these presentations are have (10:48 - 10:54)
been done for media so you know you have (10:52 - 10:56)
your polygon your IGN your game explain (10:54 - 10:59)
your Game Spot your Nintendo life (10:56 - 11:01)
um (10:59 - 11:05)
so I I know he was from uh an outlet I (11:01 - 11:06)
don't know the other guy either uh but (11:05 - 11:08)
the guy who's like I don't I have no (11:06 - 11:09)
clue what Outlet he was from he didn't (11:08 - 11:12)
say anything to me uh he didn't (11:09 - 11:14)
I don't know I got the vibe that he (11:12 - 11:16)
didn't like Pokemon but I don't know (11:14 - 11:18)
maybe he loved Pokemon he just nice (11:16 - 11:22)
it's uh he just didn't and to confirm (11:18 - 11:24)
you did not get to meet Simone de Roche (11:22 - 11:27)
for no (11:24 - 11:30)
come on (11:27 - 11:30)
please because we need to be besties (11:41 - 11:47)
ease (11:44 - 11:47)
I already am her bestie she just doesn't (11:47 - 11:52)
know it oh I'll be valid valid value (11:50 - 11:53)
valid (11:52 - 11:56)
okay so uh today's episode is going to (11:53 - 11:58)
be just a little bit of news and then um (11:56 - 12:00)
it'll go to break we'll include the 90 (11:58 - 12:02)
minute episodes of what I played and (12:00 - 12:04)
then uh we'll do question of the week (12:02 - 12:05)
Pokemon week so it's already we already (12:04 - 12:08)
have 90 minutes built in uh because of (12:05 - 12:10)
that segment so we're gonna try to get (12:08 - 12:11)
through this news a little bit quicker (12:10 - 12:13)
here (12:11 - 12:17)
um the first bit of news that I have (12:13 - 12:21)
is uh oh where'd he go oh here it is uh (12:17 - 12:22)
you can encounter glass rear and (12:21 - 12:24)
Spectrum x-ray Battles by the time that (12:22 - 12:26)
this episode goes up uh that will be (12:24 - 12:30)
over because it ends on October 23rd (12:26 - 12:34)
why was this one only a weekend I think (12:30 - 12:35)
because they're going to do one more (12:34 - 12:38)
that's my speculation (12:35 - 12:40)
but they could go until Thursday and be (12:38 - 12:42)
like and then the changeover happens I (12:40 - 12:44)
don't guess why this one was so short (12:42 - 12:46)
because they're really they the the one (12:44 - 12:48)
person that knows how to hit the end (12:46 - 12:51)
raid button only works on Sundays well (12:48 - 12:55)
for crying out loud they can Janine now (12:51 - 12:57)
they've got to redo the servers and test (12:55 - 13:00)
and they gotta zap the pram and there's (12:57 - 13:04)
just lots of ghosts to happen in October (13:00 - 13:08)
um so yeah I I we didn't cover this news (13:04 - 13:10)
but like a week or two ago they they (13:08 - 13:13)
pretty much said that there will be no (13:10 - 13:15)
more updates after November 1st to (13:13 - 13:17)
Pokemon sword and shield (13:15 - 13:19)
so what that means is like whatever the (13:17 - 13:20)
last competitive season is going to be (13:19 - 13:23)
the final competitive season which is (13:20 - 13:24)
um two restricted legendaries no (13:23 - 13:27)
mythicals pretty much the the format (13:24 - 13:29)
used for worlds so you will still be (13:27 - 13:31)
able to get like the master rank ribbon (13:29 - 13:34)
there will still be like ranked battles (13:31 - 13:36)
it's just that it's not going to reset (13:34 - 13:39)
anymore it's just gonna live forever (13:36 - 13:41)
um there's I mean eventually it will (13:39 - 13:42)
probably shut down (13:41 - 13:46)
when the switch eventually shuts down (13:42 - 13:48)
um and then the wild area will not have (13:46 - 13:50)
any more rotation so whatever the wild (13:48 - 13:52)
area will be and which I don't actually (13:50 - 13:55)
know I don't know if they're going to (13:52 - 13:56)
you know the first version of the wild (13:55 - 13:59)
area it was like one percent gigantomax (13:56 - 14:01)
Lapras and then like three months later (13:59 - 14:03)
it was like 50 gigantic slappers I don't (14:01 - 14:05)
know what final version of the wild area (14:03 - 14:08)
they're gonna leave with us but (14:05 - 14:10)
when they said that I looked at the (14:08 - 14:11)
calendar and I was like well we really (14:10 - 14:13)
you know they always update these raid (14:11 - 14:15)
battles on Thursdays we really only have (14:13 - 14:17)
like two Thursdays left we have the 20th (14:15 - 14:19)
and the 27th and there's no way they're (14:17 - 14:21)
not going to go all of October without (14:19 - 14:24)
doing one final Raid Battle (14:21 - 14:27)
and then the 20th came they did the (14:24 - 14:30)
glastria Spectra in raids you cannot (14:27 - 14:31)
catch them you couldn't catch them I (14:30 - 14:33)
should say that because it's gone (14:31 - 14:35)
um the rewards were really good though (14:33 - 14:37)
uh you were guaranteed 100 an Ability (14:35 - 14:41)
capsule uh you were 70 bottle guaranteed (14:37 - 14:44)
a bottle cap 40 for a golden bottle cap (14:41 - 14:46)
and then a hundred percent for all these (14:44 - 14:48)
super super rare berries and so like if (14:46 - 14:50)
you're not a competitive person you're (14:48 - 14:51)
probably like oh I don't care about any (14:50 - 14:53)
of these competitive items uh you can (14:51 - 14:55)
still use them if you like to play (14:53 - 14:56)
through the story or you want to just (14:55 - 14:59)
power up your favorite personal Pokemon (14:56 - 15:00)
uh but if you're not a competitive (14:59 - 15:02)
person uh maybe you're a curry person (15:00 - 15:04)
those those berries were really really (15:02 - 15:05)
good for getting Charizard class if you (15:04 - 15:06)
wanted to get (15:05 - 15:08)
to finish your Curry ducks or just get (15:06 - 15:11)
Charizard class in general those berries (15:08 - 15:13)
were super good (15:11 - 15:15)
um and then I think it was like uh you (15:13 - 15:17)
got six guaranteed XL candy and six (15:15 - 15:18)
guaranteed large candy which is really (15:17 - 15:20)
really great for leveling up your (15:18 - 15:21)
Pokemon again (15:20 - 15:24)
um they were pretty easy raids I would (15:21 - 15:26)
say (15:24 - 15:27)
um (15:26 - 15:29)
but yeah they were not catchable this (15:27 - 15:31)
was not the first time they have not (15:29 - 15:33)
done this is not the first time there (15:31 - 15:34)
has been raids that were not catchable (15:33 - 15:36)
they did urshifu (15:34 - 15:38)
I want to say two months back they did (15:36 - 15:39)
me too (15:38 - 15:42)
um they did Zara Aura they did (15:39 - 15:43)
um (15:42 - 15:47)
a gigantomax cinderace at one point (15:43 - 15:50)
that was part of another package but the (15:47 - 15:51)
center ice was that catchable they (15:50 - 15:54)
didn't want more too I can't think of it (15:51 - 15:54)
um but yeah they've they had a really (15:55 - 15:59)
good track record of having a raid week (15:57 - 16:01)
in last 10 days (15:59 - 16:04)
and this one went back to three so we (16:01 - 16:08)
have one more Thursday left the 27th uh (16:04 - 16:10)
I'm curious if we'll get a final Raid (16:08 - 16:13)
Battle my speculation if I was the guest (16:10 - 16:15)
I will guess the final one would be (16:13 - 16:19)
eternitus like big hand Alternatives I (16:15 - 16:20)
could see it but no catching just like (16:19 - 16:23)
battling why can't we just catch these (16:20 - 16:24)
at this point (16:23 - 16:27)
because they they they don't want you to (16:24 - 16:28)
have a million glass readers and (16:27 - 16:30)
inspectors yeah they're special (16:28 - 16:34)
look they want you to buy a 30 DLC you (16:30 - 16:36)
want you want to get manaphy go buy (16:34 - 16:39)
Pokemon Ranger go buy that terrible game (16:36 - 16:42)
I mean it can read but I can't excuse me (16:39 - 16:43)
you better walk that back right now (16:42 - 16:47)
Pokemon Ranger is a fantastic game thank (16:43 - 16:50)
you (16:47 - 16:50)
uh (16:51 - 16:55)
you know I think I think there's another (16:53 - 16:57)
conversation we have about how Pokemon (16:55 - 17:00)
go is really kind of duh (16:57 - 17:02)
sucked all the life out of legendary (17:00 - 17:04)
Pokemon (17:02 - 17:06)
just pay one dollar and there's your (17:04 - 17:08)
legendary (17:06 - 17:11)
you want 20 Xerneas twenty dollars oh (17:08 - 17:14)
I'm sorry I did a number of Xerneas (17:11 - 17:17)
raids and only caught one so that was (17:14 - 17:21)
like a five dollars yes thank you (17:17 - 17:21)
I don't know what else they could do (17:23 - 17:25)
though (17:24 - 17:29)
um because they did do hershifu uh I (17:25 - 17:30)
guess they could put like uh Zapdos (17:29 - 17:32)
small Trace Articuno I don't know if (17:30 - 17:34)
that would be like a good final raid (17:32 - 17:36)
yeah because I oh Oh you mean in sword (17:34 - 17:37)
and shield I thought you're still (17:36 - 17:38)
talking about Pokemon (17:37 - 17:42)
or more of those birds in my Pokemon go (17:38 - 17:45)
I've only got 40 of each (17:42 - 17:45)
they can't do some people are like oh a (17:47 - 17:51)
final a good final raid would be zombies (17:49 - 17:55)
and zashian but they they don't Dynamics (17:51 - 17:58)
they don't get big and so that I mean (17:55 - 18:01)
you could get big they could be big like (17:58 - 18:03)
this would be the rare big form (18:01 - 18:06)
unlock that gigantom X form that that's (18:03 - 18:09)
hidden it's gonna be it's going to be (18:06 - 18:11)
uh the floette that we never got (18:09 - 18:13)
released (18:11 - 18:16)
yes exactly and you can't catch that (18:13 - 18:19)
either just be there (18:16 - 18:23)
I would be severely disappointed if the (18:19 - 18:25)
27th comes and there's no Raid Battle (18:23 - 18:28)
because then the argument would be like (18:25 - 18:30)
okay why didn't you just make Specter (18:28 - 18:31)
and glass for your 10 days then because (18:30 - 18:33)
the 10th day would have been the 30th (18:31 - 18:35)
which is a Sunday which you would have (18:33 - 18:36)
ended it and that you already said (18:35 - 18:37)
there's going to be no updates after (18:36 - 18:41)
November 1st which is two days later so (18:37 - 18:41)
um (18:41 - 18:46)
uh yeah uh cool that they did that I (18:43 - 18:48)
mean like again some people are upset (18:46 - 18:51)
that you couldn't catch them (18:48 - 18:56)
um to be fair though if if if you bought (18:51 - 18:59)
sword and sword or Shield you can get as (18:56 - 19:01)
many horses as you want because you can (18:59 - 19:02)
make a new profile and you can run (19:01 - 19:05)
through and yeah yeah it's all the more (19:02 - 19:06)
reason I should just be able to catch (19:05 - 19:07)
them (19:06 - 19:09)
just you know trade somebody for it they (19:07 - 19:11)
don't want their horse (19:09 - 19:14)
everybody wants a horse everybody loves (19:11 - 19:16)
a horse did I play through this again do (19:14 - 19:18)
I have both I think I have both horses I (19:16 - 19:20)
don't think I actually have both horses (19:18 - 19:22)
because I didn't actually finish that on (19:20 - 19:24)
my second game I think I had to I had to (19:22 - 19:26)
play through anyways because I needed (19:24 - 19:28)
another urshifu (19:26 - 19:30)
and then they get you a third time you (19:28 - 19:31)
got to play through a third because you (19:30 - 19:33)
evolved the Cub Food into both Hershey (19:31 - 19:34)
Foods because you played twice but then (19:33 - 19:37)
you don't have a Kung Fu anymore (19:34 - 19:40)
and you know what my issue is (19:37 - 19:42)
I stopped at glarion Articuno because I (19:40 - 19:45)
can still hear that deck on bird but I (19:42 - 19:47)
can't find it anywhere you gotta go to (19:45 - 19:50)
the bottom of the mountain so veggies no (19:47 - 19:52)
red I got no Regis I got whatever else (19:50 - 19:55)
comes after that nope so we will this is (19:52 - 19:57)
the last this is the last month before (19:55 - 19:59)
the new game comes out are we just (19:57 - 20:01)
marathoning all the Dynamax Adventures (19:59 - 20:03)
for shinies is this our plan (20:01 - 20:07)
I mean I've tried that before (20:03 - 20:11)
but the sad news is that the current (20:07 - 20:13)
version of monster hunter is so (20:11 - 20:16)
incredibly complicated that I spend like (20:13 - 20:18)
three hours on it a day and I still (20:16 - 20:20)
can't get through it so I'm still (20:18 - 20:22)
monster huntering it up (20:20 - 20:25)
uh we how how old is the current time (20:22 - 20:26)
during this point almost two years (20:25 - 20:29)
almost two years right yeah yeah and and (20:26 - 20:32)
I I think I have caught maybe four (20:29 - 20:34)
Legends in in Dynamics Adventure because (20:32 - 20:36)
my thought process was like I already (20:34 - 20:38)
have these Legends I'll eventually shiny (20:36 - 20:40)
hunt them and then I did a million (20:38 - 20:43)
Dynamics Adventures for one specific (20:40 - 20:45)
Legend which was Landorus and then I I (20:43 - 20:47)
didn't see any of the other ones and I (20:45 - 20:49)
eventually got Landorus and then (20:47 - 20:53)
I I there there are so many uncut (20:49 - 20:56)
Legends I haven't even gotten Regigigas (20:53 - 20:58)
which is like I have all the reggies I (20:56 - 21:00)
just gotta put them in my party and go (20:58 - 21:02)
to the the den and have him pop up I (21:00 - 21:04)
don't have I didn't have a lucky or (21:02 - 21:07)
Draco yet like I haven't done any of (21:04 - 21:09)
that stuff the problem is is that (21:07 - 21:11)
I keep thinking I want to play Pokemon (21:09 - 21:13)
Unite (21:11 - 21:16)

I search for Gengar Pokemon Center and (23:59 - 24:05)
it says zero to zero products (24:01 - 24:05)
Center search engine that's bad (24:06 - 24:11)
Gengar OG (24:09 - 24:13)
you got it (24:11 - 24:17)
no Charizard's not a ghost (24:13 - 24:20)
yeah yeah I'm just saying Gengar is the (24:17 - 24:23)
OG ghost yeah that's the ghost because (24:20 - 24:25)
yeah (24:23 - 24:25)
I went to the Halloween collection there (24:28 - 24:33)
are zero out of zero products you know (24:31 - 24:35)
pokemoncenter.com is the greatest (24:33 - 24:39)
website because (24:35 - 24:39)
you try to shop for things it says (24:40 - 24:44)
no (24:42 - 24:46)
you can't have that (24:44 - 24:48)
you don't spend enough much you don't (24:46 - 24:50)
spend enough money on their website Greg (24:48 - 24:53)
so you don't get the Priority Access I (24:50 - 24:55)
tried I you know how it took me over 24 (24:53 - 25:01)
hours to buy a Rosalia jacket 24 hours (24:55 - 25:01)
I I would wager to bet they're they're (25:03 - 25:07)
the Gengar has been flying under the (25:05 - 25:09)
radar all these years but this this boy (25:07 - 25:12)
has so much merch and so much (25:09 - 25:15)
being featured in multiple games and (25:12 - 25:18)
events that I I think Gengar is given (25:15 - 25:19)
charts how to run for his money also (25:18 - 25:21)
Gengar will only be available in raid (25:19 - 25:24)
battles uh the Vulpix can be shiny the (25:21 - 25:27)
nine tails cannot be shiny (25:24 - 25:29)
um I don't although they didn't say if (25:27 - 25:31)
you could find a wild nine tails uh the (25:29 - 25:33)
Gengar can be shiny and the pumpkaboo (25:31 - 25:35)
can be shiny (25:33 - 25:37)
um which is weird because pumpkaboo (25:35 - 25:40)
can't be shiny now (25:37 - 25:44)
uh hold on let me verify that uh but (25:40 - 25:46)
pumpkaboo will turn shiny (25:44 - 25:49)
it's okay for them to allow pumpkaboo to (25:46 - 25:52)
be shiny yes cannot be shiny now but it (25:49 - 25:53)
will be shiny (25:52 - 25:55)
on Thursday (25:53 - 26:00)
yes that's okay they can that's allowed (25:55 - 26:00)
I'm already up to I'm already up to (26:00 - 26:05)
eight Gengar products on the Halloween (26:03 - 26:07)
collection and I'm not I passed the (26:05 - 26:09)
first three rows (26:07 - 26:11)
yeah there's a lot but you know it's (26:09 - 26:15)
sweet is that Gengar T-shirt oh Friday (26:11 - 26:17)
night that was looking good so much (26:15 - 26:20)
better in person (26:17 - 26:23)
uh there's two paid time research (26:20 - 26:25)
tickets I will just full disclosure (26:23 - 26:27)
ninetic gave me both these tickets for (26:25 - 26:29)
free so thanks Niantic for saving me six (26:27 - 26:31)
dollars I guess I would have bought them (26:29 - 26:33)
anyways uh (26:31 - 26:36)
the first ticket for a dollar gets you (26:33 - 26:38)
time to research that will feature yacht (26:36 - 26:39)
mask (26:38 - 26:42)
uh this was free for the lgm stuff I (26:39 - 26:43)
don't know if you guys remember that (26:42 - 26:45)
where it was like catch yeah one psychic (26:43 - 26:47)
catch five psychics you have to pay a (26:45 - 26:50)
dollar for that now (26:47 - 26:50)
um (26:51 - 26:55)
uh for five dollars you can purchase a (26:52 - 26:57)
ticket that gets you timed research for (26:55 - 26:59)
increased candy (26:57 - 27:01)
additional Halloween themed task and an (26:59 - 27:03)
avatar item the Avatar item is the (27:01 - 27:05)
little pumpkaboo Lantern character pose (27:03 - 27:08)
which is very cute (27:05 - 27:09)
um (27:08 - 27:12)
I will say I I do personally think I I (27:09 - 27:13)
would have paid the five dollars of my (27:12 - 27:15)
own money if Niantic didn't provide me a (27:13 - 27:18)
free ticket uh it does require you to (27:15 - 27:21)
play the game though like if you want an (27:18 - 27:23)
easy like five dollars for an item you'd (27:21 - 27:25)
you have to like walk two kilometers you (27:23 - 27:27)
have to get like one excellent throw you (27:25 - 27:29)
have to get you have to like send like (27:27 - 27:32)
14 gifts you have to catch (27:29 - 27:35)
we have to get like 10 curve balls they (27:32 - 27:37)
don't have to be like in a row but you (27:35 - 27:38)
what I'm saying is you do have to (27:37 - 27:41)
actually play the game (27:38 - 27:43)
uh I did do it in (27:41 - 27:46)
about two hours of like heavily playing (27:43 - 27:48)
Pokemon go like that's what I was I was (27:46 - 27:51)
out playing Pokemon go for two hours at (27:48 - 27:54)
uh gold medal Park (27:51 - 27:55)
um (27:54 - 27:57)
and (27:55 - 28:02)
so just a heads up these These are timed (27:57 - 28:04)
so if you purchase the five dollar (28:02 - 28:07)
ticket and November first rolls around (28:04 - 28:11)
and it's 1001 am and you didn't finish (28:07 - 28:13)
it it goes away and you don't get the (28:11 - 28:15)
Avatar item you paid for (28:13 - 28:17)
which if I could say anything about (28:15 - 28:19)
these tickets (28:17 - 28:19)
why do that I paid for it (28:20 - 28:25)
even if it's like catch 20 pumpkaboo and (28:25 - 28:30)
you D like I have to wait a full year (28:28 - 28:33)
for 20 pumpkaboo that's fine I paid for (28:30 - 28:36)
it I'll wait the full year it clearly (28:33 - 28:37)
wasn't important enough for me to finish (28:36 - 28:40)
now (28:37 - 28:41)
um (28:40 - 28:42)
this is not an Niantic issue though (28:41 - 28:44)
there's tons of video games that do this (28:42 - 28:46)
where it's like you you pay for some (28:44 - 28:48)

simulator like Pokemon Masters well I'm (29:02 - 29:05)
out (29:04 - 29:06)
sorry (29:05 - 29:08)
but you could find a boyfriend in the (29:06 - 29:10)
real world through Pokemon go because (29:08 - 29:15)
you get together in person I (29:10 - 29:15)
I don't believe that actually happens (29:15 - 29:19)
Plus (29:17 - 29:21)
I'd have to take my wedding ring off you (29:19 - 29:23)
need to watch more horror Hallmark (29:21 - 29:26)
movies but true Hallmark movies will (29:23 - 29:27)
give you faith in finding boyfriends (29:26 - 29:30)
when are you inviting me over for a (29:27 - 29:31)
marathon when I moved to a new house (29:30 - 29:35)
that's not a Horror House of Horrors (29:31 - 29:37)
so next year (29:35 - 29:38)
and you won't come because it'll be in (29:37 - 29:41)
Saint Paul I will come to Saint Paul if (29:38 - 29:44)
I have a good reason to go to Saint Paul (29:41 - 29:47)
St Paul's a weird City get out tell me (29:44 - 29:50)
about it get out of here (29:47 - 29:50)
uh there will be special research (29:51 - 29:57)
uh if you get the 7K eggs uh yamas (29:54 - 30:00)
Galleria Nia mask Phantump golet and (29:57 - 30:03)
Noibat are in 7K eggs Phantom and golet (30:00 - 30:06)
cannot be shiny uh Pikachu with a hat is (30:03 - 30:08)
returning I believe this is the same (30:06 - 30:10)
Pikachu's last year (30:08 - 30:11)
um (30:10 - 30:12)
there was a question in our slack (30:11 - 30:14)
whether like (30:12 - 30:17)
all gen 1 Pokemon can be shiny in (30:14 - 30:19)
Pokemon go now that the Kanto tour (30:17 - 30:21)
happened (30:19 - 30:22)
and I was like I don't think that's true (30:21 - 30:25)
like sometimes they like when Charizard (30:22 - 30:27)
with a party hat was like available he (30:25 - 30:29)
could be shiny (30:27 - 30:30)
um and like when neat and when when (30:29 - 30:32)
there was like the women's day event (30:30 - 30:35)
which was like geez like four years ago (30:32 - 30:38)
like Neato Queen could be shiny in the (30:35 - 30:39)
wild (30:38 - 30:40)
um (30:39 - 30:42)
but like right here on their graphic (30:40 - 30:44)
they're like Haunter cannot be shiny (30:42 - 30:46)
like I don't know why we're still in (30:44 - 30:47)
this weird (30:46 - 30:49)
well and we said that because like there (30:47 - 30:51)
was an event like two weeks ago where (30:49 - 30:53)
they they just decided to have just (30:51 - 30:55)
middle Evolution spawn and it was like (30:53 - 30:56)
why are they spawning middle Evolution (30:55 - 30:58)
Kanto Pokemon that can't be shiny like (30:56 - 31:00)
just give me the base form that at least (30:58 - 31:03)
like you can get a shiny ghastly and (31:00 - 31:05)
evolve it into a shiny Haunter so (31:03 - 31:08)
technically you can have a shiny Haunter (31:05 - 31:11)
in Pokemon go yeah but not with any (31:08 - 31:13)
Haunter I see in the wild there's zero (31:11 - 31:14)
point to tap on it because it can't be (31:13 - 31:16)
unless I want Gengar candy but I don't (31:14 - 31:17)
need gang arcade because gengar's been (31:16 - 31:19)
around since for five years I'm swimming (31:17 - 31:21)
in Gengar candy what if Haunter is your (31:19 - 31:23)
favorite Pokemon then you have 100 (31:21 - 31:26)
reason to tap on that look at how many (31:23 - 31:29)
roselias Greg like only keeps rosellias (31:26 - 31:32)
in his Pokemon go and in my home look (31:29 - 31:35)
I'm lousy with them and I want more all (31:32 - 31:38)
the time all you all you people who (31:35 - 31:41)
think you're a fan of your Pokemon nah (31:38 - 31:44)
uh you're not I waited 24 hours with the (31:41 - 31:49)
world's worst website to buy one jacket (31:44 - 31:52)
that is my commitment (31:49 - 31:55)
uh Piplup is also coming back with a uh (31:52 - 31:56)
costume which I think was from last year (31:55 - 31:59)
so I I guess start working chip chart to (31:56 - 32:02)
not get the memo uh but they aren't cute (31:59 - 32:06)
enough Piplup is cute enough (32:02 - 32:08)
uh there was also new Avatar where you (32:06 - 32:10)
could be like a dusclops (32:08 - 32:12)
um that's in the store now lavender (32:10 - 32:15)
lavender time music is playing at night (32:12 - 32:17)
it's been five years I've still got (32:15 - 32:19)
heard this Pokemon go put it on YouTube (32:17 - 32:24)
tube I don't play with the sound on I (32:19 - 32:26)
you don't have to go to YouTube and look (32:24 - 32:28)
it up and just listen to it it's really (32:26 - 32:30)
good and I would like our listeners to (32:28 - 32:32)
understand that not only is Steve so (32:30 - 32:34)
obnoxious about not playing with the (32:32 - 32:39)
sound on he complains that I play yeah (32:34 - 32:39)
no so when we play together (32:40 - 32:49)
I keep headphones in so I can enjoy the (32:44 - 32:51)
sound (32:49 - 32:54)
and not have to hear complaints about it (32:51 - 32:56)
now will we get lunch together and (32:54 - 32:59)
you'll keep your headphones it's not (32:56 - 33:02)
true don't agree better than that with (32:59 - 33:06)
Steve on many things virtually nothing (33:02 - 33:09)
but I do agree about the sound in (33:06 - 33:12)
Pokemon go it should always be off if (33:09 - 33:14)
there's no reason there is there's no (33:12 - 33:16)
reason to have the announcer on in (33:14 - 33:18)
Pokemon unite and there is no reason to (33:16 - 33:21)
have the sound on in Pokemon go I I (33:18 - 33:23)
would turn okay I there are there was (33:21 - 33:24)
there was one game that I would always (33:23 - 33:26)
play with the sound on and that was that (33:24 - 33:28)
was Clash Royale and one because you (33:26 - 33:31)
needed you needed to hear you need only (33:28 - 33:34)
for hog rider well okay two things you (33:31 - 33:36)
needed to hear when certain units (33:34 - 33:37)
dropped because sometimes people would (33:36 - 33:39)
drop units underneath another unit and (33:37 - 33:41)
it you couldn't see it but you could (33:39 - 33:43)
hear it like oh I know for sure they (33:41 - 33:45)
played something but secondly you needed (33:43 - 33:47)
to hear the Hog Rider voice which was (33:45 - 33:49)
like (33:47 - 33:49)
and and that in itself (33:51 - 33:55)
the thing about Pokemon go sound is it's (33:58 - 34:04)
it's been bad since day one it is maybe (34:01 - 34:06)
because I mean I am the actual Boomer (34:04 - 34:08)
out of the three of us correct that that (34:06 - 34:12)
sound is so ear piercing the like the (34:08 - 34:15)
the like Ching like open menu sound and (34:12 - 34:18)
like the to do and then when you're like (34:15 - 34:23)
it's all very jarring I went into the (34:18 - 34:26)
settings of Pokemon go and turned off (34:23 - 34:30)
all the sounds just in case I started it (34:26 - 34:33)
up with my phone not on silent to ever (34:30 - 34:36)
avoid having those sounds ever play (34:33 - 34:38)
I have a third question now that I'm (34:36 - 34:41)
thinking about it okay (34:38 - 34:44)
will the raids that are coming next week (34:41 - 34:46)
and drop the soundtrack for sword and (34:44 - 34:48)
shield (34:46 - 34:48)
no of course not what okay here's the (34:49 - 34:54)
secret that somebody's gonna make like a (34:52 - 34:56)
video in either five or ten years and (34:54 - 34:58)
it's going to be titled The Secret of (34:56 - 35:00)
Pokemon sword and shield that nobody (34:58 - 35:03)
knew until now they actually lost the (35:00 - 35:07)
rights to their own music that I would (35:03 - 35:10)
die definitely signed away the rights to (35:07 - 35:12)
their own music to North Korea and since (35:10 - 35:15)
North Korea doesn't believe in music for (35:12 - 35:19)
anyone nobody can have it (35:15 - 35:19)
the um (35:20 - 35:23)
the Japanese Pokemon Twitter account (35:24 - 35:30)
tweeted a picture of (35:27 - 35:33)
Vinyl cover like vinyl albums and one (35:30 - 35:35)
was scarlet and one was Violet and I (35:33 - 35:38)
couldn't help but think that's tight (35:35 - 35:42)
but what about sword and shields music (35:38 - 35:42)
What's Happening Here (35:42 - 35:45)
oh (35:46 - 35:50)

and am I it's not a useful Pokemon by (36:19 - 36:27)
any means but it is cool looking uh I I (36:23 - 36:30)
usually gravitate towards Derpy Pokemon (36:27 - 36:32)
personally (36:30 - 36:36)
um but Mega Bennett hits that like cool (36:32 - 36:39)
design itch that I'm like very into I (36:36 - 36:41)

it was a fire Pokemon uh which like and (36:55 - 37:00)
I don't I don't hate I don't have any (36:58 - 37:02)
problem with armor Rouge it's just like (37:00 - 37:04)
I I didn't feel like any connection like (37:02 - 37:06)
I I I'm sure there are tons of people (37:04 - 37:08)
that love that Pokemon are very excited (37:06 - 37:09)
for that Pokemon I'm very happy for (37:08 - 37:11)

Pokemon (37:11 - 37:14)
um (37:13 - 37:17)

I'm sure somebody else noticed where (38:11 - 38:15)
Steve said Pokemon go doesn't care about (38:12 - 38:17)
Mexico and I was like they specifically (38:15 - 38:20)

America no you said Mexico you literally (38:32 - 38:37)
said Pokemon go does not care about (38:35 - 38:40)
Mexico yeah well to be fair the Pokemon (38:37 - 38:41)
company also doesn't care about Mexico (38:40 - 38:44)
and South America because they they all (38:41 - 38:46)

button there will be Avatar items in the (43:26 - 43:29)
store (43:28 - 43:32)
um (43:29 - 43:32)
I I believe (43:33 - 43:38)
that when this happened like last year (43:36 - 43:41)
this it was worldwide as well but like (43:38 - 43:43)
Mexico had like more features or (43:41 - 43:45)
something I remember reading two press (43:43 - 43:47)
releases like if you were in Mexico you (43:45 - 43:48)
would get this and if you were outside (43:47 - 43:51)
of Mexico you would get this (43:48 - 43:53)
um but it seems like everyone is getting (43:51 - 43:54)
the same thing this year (43:53 - 43:57)
which is a a a a a a win for the world (43:54 - 44:01)
maybe not a win for Mexico but (43:57 - 44:01)
maybe they wanted their special events (44:02 - 44:05)
to themselves but ah it seems like a (44:03 - 44:07)
good event minus that it's not even 48 (44:05 - 44:10)
hours long but (44:07 - 44:10)
but also I don't know I already saw a (44:12 - 44:15)
bunch of YouTubers being like this is (44:14 - 44:17)
going to be the rarest shiny ever it's (44:15 - 44:19)
only going to be funny look it'll come (44:17 - 44:22)
back next year it'll be fine (44:19 - 44:22)
Apparently one of the rarest shinies (44:25 - 44:30)
ever was uh the the Pikachu wearing the (44:27 - 44:33)
one-piece hat but boy all it took was a (44:30 - 44:34)
question mark unknown and people were (44:33 - 44:37)
offering me those shiny Luffy Pikachus (44:34 - 44:40)
left and right (44:37 - 44:40)
don't underestimate the power of a (44:41 - 44:45)
non-shiny Pokemon (44:43 - 44:47)
unknown question mark was selling like (44:45 - 44:51)
hotcakes over at go Fest uh that's um (44:47 - 44:53)

cash Fantasy Flight it's not Fantasy (47:26 - 47:30)
Flight anymore it's games enter (47:29 - 47:34)
the game center zenter it's a z (47:30 - 47:37)
it's the world's worst name that has (47:34 - 47:39)
ever existed and I hate it but whatever (47:37 - 47:41)
and they also keep changing the menu and (47:39 - 47:43)
I'm like please stop will (47:41 - 47:45)
this literally yesterday (47:43 - 47:48)
went there and this is what the guy at (47:45 - 47:50)
the cash register said to give you a (47:48 - 47:53)
hint of what my evening was like (47:50 - 47:55)
um I don't know the answer to that we're (47:53 - 47:57)
all new employees (47:55 - 48:00)
there's only one person who's been here (47:57 - 48:02)
longer than anybody else because we've (48:00 - 48:05)
all been hired in the last week sounds (48:02 - 48:10)
about right and I about lost it (48:05 - 48:10)
you've rent board games you sit down you (48:12 - 48:16)
order some food how complicated you (48:14 - 48:19)
don't rent them they're just there it (48:16 - 48:20)
was the ordering food that became (48:19 - 48:23)
increasingly difficult for whatever (48:20 - 48:25)
reason and a person wanted a pitcher of (48:23 - 48:27)
water and they literally had to search (48:25 - 48:30)
their entire area to find a pitcher to (48:27 - 48:34)
put water in and I (48:30 - 48:36)
yeah I'm starting uh what is that site (48:34 - 48:38)
where you do petitions (48:36 - 48:43)
change.org change.org please asmodee bye (48:38 - 48:46)
bye Game Center back from the from the (48:43 - 48:50)
terrible owner of Fantasy Flight games (48:46 - 48:52)
okay uh we're gonna take a break and (48:50 - 48:54)
then we're gonna include the uh 90 (48:52 - 48:57)
minute session this is a long one this (48:54 - 48:59)
week folks sorry if if you're listening (48:57 - 49:01)
to the premium version I'm probably not (48:59 - 49:03)
going to include that because (49:01 - 49:07)
you already had it and that which is (49:03 - 49:09)
plenty already right 48 minutes that (49:07 - 49:11)
would just require you to like skip it (49:09 - 49:12)
and so (49:11 - 49:15)
you know before just one quick thing and (49:12 - 49:17)
this is relevant to ad breaks and breaks (49:15 - 49:19)
and such and premium versions (49:17 - 49:22)
only one person noticed (49:19 - 49:25)
on one of the recent episodes that I (49:22 - 49:27)
produced and published that I put the (49:25 - 49:30)
song In Reverse (49:27 - 49:33)
only one person commenting which makes (49:30 - 49:36)
me think that people are just skipping (49:33 - 49:39)
the song completely (49:36 - 49:42)
I literally played it backwards I don't (49:39 - 49:43)
think I know (49:42 - 49:45)
oh my (49:43 - 49:45)
God we're back uh BRB (49:50 - 49:56)
and we are back from our break (49:53 - 50:00)
uh uh Greg hit us with the question of (49:56 - 50:02)
the week I'm sorry (50:00 - 50:04)
it's yeah (50:02 - 50:06)
my mouth stopped working for two seconds (50:04 - 50:08)
that's that's a real Back start that are (50:06 - 50:14)
again I'm sorry but it's question time I (50:08 - 50:19)
want to hear the question of the week (50:14 - 50:19)
are (50:21 - 50:25)
geez if you really love question of the (50:22 - 50:28)
week I answered over 75 nobody people (50:25 - 50:31)
love my part of it and they're very very (50:28 - 50:33)
lukewarm on your part of it (50:31 - 50:36)
um uh I put that video up on uh YouTube (50:33 - 50:40)
on Sunday uh it's titled 75 Pokemon (50:36 - 50:43)
scarlet and violet questions answered (50:40 - 50:44)
um (50:43 - 50:48)
I I look I I've said this before I (50:44 - 50:50)
haven't looked at any of the leaks I (50:48 - 50:52)
don't know what has been confirmed or (50:50 - 50:54)
not confirmed in the leaks so there (50:52 - 50:56)
might be somebody that I'm like Wait no (50:54 - 50:57)
that's because I I don't know I didn't (50:56 - 50:59)
look (50:57 - 51:01)
um I I'm assuming part of the reason why (50:59 - 51:03)
I was invited was because I didn't make (51:01 - 51:07)
YouTube videos about leaks uh (51:03 - 51:11)
Nintendo is very uh very in in tune with (51:07 - 51:13)
who's making what content out there (51:11 - 51:15)
um as is Pokemon (51:13 - 51:16)
um (51:15 - 51:18)
I've talked to the people from Pokemon (51:16 - 51:21)
many times and they they are very okay (51:18 - 51:24)
with nuzlocks they are not okay with (51:21 - 51:27)
randomizers hey yep they do not like you (51:24 - 51:29)
randomizing and emulating your game in (51:27 - 51:33)
whatever fashion anyways uh a question (51:29 - 51:37)
that uh I'm not I guess I'm pulling from (51:33 - 51:38)
various YouTube things I I do want to (51:37 - 51:42)
kind of clarify this one more time uh (51:38 - 51:46)
because I think it's important is what (51:42 - 51:49)
happens when you trastilize uh (51:46 - 51:52)
and I'm going to use I'm going to use a (51:49 - 51:54)
Tyranitar example (51:52 - 51:55)
um (51:54 - 51:59)
so the the question is (51:55 - 52:03)
if I have Tyranitar which is rock and (51:59 - 52:07)
dark type and I terrazolized to ghosts (52:03 - 52:11)
will I lose my advantage of (52:07 - 52:14)
having stab which is same type attack (52:11 - 52:17)
bonus on my Tyranitar so that I am no (52:14 - 52:19)
longer weak (52:17 - 52:21)
to fighting in fact fighting can't do (52:19 - 52:23)
any damage to me because I'm a ghost (52:21 - 52:26)
and the answer is (52:23 - 52:28)
I'm 99 99 sure on this because I've (52:26 - 52:30)
talked to multiple Nintendo people and (52:28 - 52:32)
so did Joe from serebi and he got the (52:30 - 52:34)
same answer is you don't lose your (52:32 - 52:36)
original (52:34 - 52:38)
stab (52:36 - 52:41)
but you gain a new stab (52:38 - 52:44)
but you're still weak to the thing you (52:41 - 52:46)
should ask lies to so let me let me give (52:44 - 52:48)
you an example so let's just pretend (52:46 - 52:51)
that rock slide and crunch do a hundred (52:48 - 52:53)
damage I know they don't but for this (52:51 - 52:56)
example we're gonna do basic math so if (52:53 - 52:58)
I'm if I'm Tyranitar and I use rockslide (52:56 - 53:01)
I'm actually doing 150 damage because (52:58 - 53:04)
I'm a rock type Pokemon so I get a 50 (53:01 - 53:08)
boost to to my move so my rock slide (53:04 - 53:10)
does 150 damage my crunch does 150 (53:08 - 53:12)
damage and then let's just say I have (53:10 - 53:13)
Hyper Beam and Hyper Beam does 100 (53:12 - 53:15)
damage (53:13 - 53:16)
um Hyper Beam only does 100 damage (53:15 - 53:18)
because it doesn't match it now if I was (53:16 - 53:19)
all a chunk using Hyper Beam it would do (53:18 - 53:21)
150 damage because all the chunks type (53:19 - 53:23)
is normal that's just how stab works (53:21 - 53:25)
that's again those are just rough (53:23 - 53:26)
numbers (53:25 - 53:29)
um so if I'm a Tyranitar and I have rock (53:26 - 53:31)
slide and crunch they're doing more (53:29 - 53:33)
damage because it matches my type (53:31 - 53:36)
and then my last move is Shadow claw and (53:33 - 53:38)
let's just assume that shadowclaw also (53:36 - 53:40)
does 100 damage uh before I hit that (53:38 - 53:42)
terracialize button shadowclock does 100 (53:40 - 53:45)
damage uh when I traclize into a ghost (53:42 - 53:48)
type uh my shadow claw will now do 150 (53:45 - 53:51)
damage because I am now a ghost type (53:48 - 53:52)
Pokemon (53:51 - 53:54)
um so I get the stab from being a ghost (53:52 - 53:56)
type but (53:54 - 53:58)
even though I'm only weak to what Ghost (53:56 - 54:00)
type Pokemon are weak to which is Ghost (53:58 - 54:03)
and dark I I am no longer dark type I am (54:00 - 54:05)
no longer rock type I am Ghost type (54:03 - 54:07)
because I hit that tarantulas button uh (54:05 - 54:11)
I still get my stab from rock slide and (54:07 - 54:14)
crunch because that was my original type (54:11 - 54:17)
but I am only week two (54:14 - 54:19)
what Ghost type Pokemon are weak to that (54:17 - 54:21)
means in the example that the trailer (54:19 - 54:23)
showed that Gallade couldn't close (54:21 - 54:26)
combat me because my I'm I'm no longer (54:23 - 54:28)
darker Rock I'm ghost (54:26 - 54:31)
so it's it's actually I know I I know my (54:28 - 54:33)
when I was saying that and I was like oh (54:31 - 54:35)
the person I asked how to ask somebody (54:33 - 54:36)
else the person I asked that Nintendo (54:35 - 54:38)
had to ask somebody else at Nintendo (54:36 - 54:41)
it it (54:38 - 54:41)
it's kind of a complicated question (54:41 - 54:45)
um (54:45 - 54:49)
so another example is you know if you (54:47 - 54:52)
were a Charizard Charizard is flying (54:49 - 54:56)
fire and you teracelize into dragon (54:52 - 54:59)
you're no longer weak to water because (54:56 - 55:02)
Dragon resist water (54:59 - 55:02)
um (55:02 - 55:05)
but you would still get a you would (55:02 - 55:07)
still get these power that you would get (55:05 - 55:09)
from like an air slash or a flamethrower (55:07 - 55:12)
because Charizard is still gets the (55:09 - 55:14)
benefits of fire flying so I think the (55:12 - 55:17)
way that I would put that is for (55:14 - 55:19)
attacking (55:17 - 55:22)
you are a triple type if you were a (55:19 - 55:25)
double type because it adds a type (55:22 - 55:29)
but yes for defending you're a mono type (55:25 - 55:32)
yes that's a really good way to explain (55:29 - 55:34)
it (55:32 - 55:36)
um the other really quick question that (55:34 - 55:37)
I don't think I answered in the 75 (55:36 - 55:39)
questions answered (55:37 - 55:41)
well somebody said what if you have two (55:39 - 55:42)
types (55:41 - 55:45)
and you catch that Pokemon which Terror (55:42 - 55:48)
type would it be it's 50 50. so if you (55:45 - 55:50)
catch lechonk lechonk is only normal (55:48 - 55:53)
type so every little chunk you catch is (55:50 - 55:58)
normal tracelized unless that lechonk (55:53 - 56:00)
is from a raid (55:58 - 56:02)
or unless that electronic has that Super (56:00 - 56:04)
Saiyan glow which means it would be (56:02 - 56:07)
different the yellow yeah if it was like (56:04 - 56:08)
a Roselia (56:07 - 56:10)
I don't know if Rosalia is in the game (56:08 - 56:11)
I'm just using it because Greg's here (56:10 - 56:14)
why if it's a Rosalia and you catch it (56:11 - 56:16)
it's either 50 of the time it's going to (56:14 - 56:19)
be grass Terror type the other 50 of the (56:16 - 56:21)
time it's gonna be poison (56:19 - 56:23)
which is kind of maybe unfortunate like (56:21 - 56:26)
let's just say in the Roselia example (56:23 - 56:28)
um like poison is the better Terror type (56:26 - 56:30)
for Roselia and then you find a shiny (56:28 - 56:33)
one and it ends up being grass (56:30 - 56:34)
um because you can't control the tear (56:33 - 56:36)
type it's just 50 50. but that we've (56:34 - 56:38)
already had that problem that problem's (56:36 - 56:39)
already existed with abilities (56:38 - 56:42)
they did make an Ability capsule which (56:39 - 56:44)
is you change it but (56:42 - 56:46)
uh yeah we (56:44 - 56:49)
we know that how that works too so (56:46 - 56:51)
there's your (56:49 - 56:54)
if you if you want more questions (56:51 - 56:57)
um I answer a lot of them on on YouTube (56:54 - 57:01)
uh so I put a lot of YouTube content (56:57 - 57:03)
um we're trying to get to 50 000 on (57:01 - 57:06)
YouTube we're at like 43 so youtube.com (57:03 - 57:09)
pkmncst if you want to watch that stuff (57:06 - 57:11)
I did edit the last two videos myself (57:09 - 57:12)
and I put a lot of work into it to make (57:11 - 57:15)
sure it's not a waste of your time (57:12 - 57:17)
um so if if you like it I don't know (57:15 - 57:20)
like comment subscribe all that stuff (57:17 - 57:23)
the algorithm stuff (57:20 - 57:25)
all right well Pokemon of the week (57:23 - 57:27)
oh boy you went faster than I was ready (57:25 - 57:28)
for (57:27 - 57:31)
uh last week's Pokemon I was once again (57:28 - 57:35)
talking about yarn stuff and how Angora (57:31 - 57:37)
wool comes from Rabbits but mohair wool (57:35 - 57:39)
comes from Angora goats (57:37 - 57:42)
and Cashmere comes from goats not sheep (57:39 - 57:44)
and there's a yarn produced in Kalos (57:42 - 57:47)
which is only taken from a fully grown (57:44 - 57:49)
creature but it's considered a (57:47 - 57:51)
plant-based fiber more similar to Bamboo (57:49 - 57:54)
and cotton than wool so the answer must (57:51 - 57:58)
be it (57:54 - 57:58)
Mareep (57:59 - 58:04)

and apparently (58:21 - 58:25)
really expensive llamas (58:22 - 58:28)
alpaca I think of Acuna is more like an (58:25 - 58:31)
alpaca oh (58:28 - 58:33)
do you think anyone actually shops at (58:31 - 58:35)
the alpaca store at Mall absolutely they (58:33 - 58:38)
do what (58:35 - 58:38)
I mean maybe not for yarn but they're (58:38 - 58:40)
shopping or something because that's (58:39 - 58:42)
where they've been open for five years (58:40 - 58:43)
yeah they don't have yarn at that store (58:42 - 58:46)
but I literally have 300 of alpaca (58:43 - 58:49)
hanging in my closet right now (58:46 - 58:51)
because that's some good fiber uh don't (58:49 - 58:55)

HP and go goats got 123. (59:28 - 59:33)
it (59:33 - 59:35)
in pre-release footage shown at the E3 (59:36 - 59:41)
developer Roundtable (59:38 - 59:44)
I love the trivia (59:41 - 59:47)
question's shiny form was shown however (59:44 - 59:49)
in the final release its shiny colors (59:47 - 59:54)
were dramatic dramatically changed yeah (59:49 - 59:54)
oh I see they have a little picture of (59:55 - 60:00)
it too yeah the original shiny was bad (59:57 - 60:04)
the new shiny is great yeah (60:00 - 60:08)
Gogo's a really cool Pokemon yeah (60:04 - 60:10)
it's like like one of those Pokemon that (60:08 - 60:13)
is just really well does like it's not (60:10 - 60:16)
like a pretty poke it's not like like I (60:13 - 60:17)
don't think it's pretty (60:16 - 60:20)
uh but I think it's like really well (60:17 - 60:22)
designed (60:20 - 60:23)
you think it's you think it's good (60:22 - 60:26)
looking yeah it's kind of it's got a (60:23 - 60:30)
leaf boa on it's kind of handlebar horns (60:26 - 60:33)
it's got cute little feet (60:30 - 60:37)
you can make a bamboo yarn out of it for (60:33 - 60:39)
five things there you go there's a spool (60:37 - 60:43)
as well look these are some rare plants (60:39 - 60:46)
uh I also have commentary (60:43 - 60:48)
um just I need to insert this for all (60:46 - 60:51)
the people who felt the need to comment (60:48 - 60:54)
and say well the video said the name of (60:51 - 60:58)
that Pokemon is for rigorraf Steve was (60:54 - 61:01)
pronouncing it correctly when I say that (60:58 - 61:02)
the name of that Pokemon is for a (61:01 - 61:05)
giraffe if you insist on calling it (61:02 - 61:08)
frigograph for the rest of your life (61:05 - 61:12)
when you see the file format GIF you (61:08 - 61:17)
must call it a gif no matter how dumb (61:12 - 61:21)
that sounds cosine (61:17 - 61:21)
cannot say GIF you must say GIF yep (61:22 - 61:27)
cosine I just want to point out that (61:25 - 61:29)
dialga's name should be dial but you (61:27 - 61:31)
don't say it that way this week's (61:29 - 61:33)
Pokemon (61:31 - 61:33)
this Pokemon with a strangely deep and (61:34 - 61:39)
feminine voice based on an animal you (61:36 - 61:41)
used to be able to buy in a cup or (61:39 - 61:44)
plastic bag at the school Fair lures two (61:41 - 61:46)
moves named specifically for the (61:44 - 61:49)
physical feature on top of its head (61:46 - 61:51)
Greg you and I were the only ones around (61:49 - 61:54)
when you guys at the school Fair wow wow (61:51 - 61:57)
I haven't thought about that in a long (61:54 - 61:59)
you imagine if they tried that these (61:57 - 62:03)
days there would be riots (61:59 - 62:03)
oh my God you guys remember (62:03 - 62:09)
yeah probably the answer is yes I know (62:07 - 62:11)
you guys remember but like the early 90s (62:09 - 62:13)
were like dolphin merchandise was like (62:11 - 62:14)
everywhere (62:13 - 62:17)
oh there's a new way that was part of (62:14 - 62:18)
the new age (62:17 - 62:21)
90s Resurgence like the dolphin stuff (62:18 - 62:23)
made its way into pop culture but if you (62:21 - 62:26)
are on a college campus you are heading (62:23 - 62:28)
to that Occult Store to buy your (62:26 - 62:30)
witchcraft books and your incense and (62:28 - 62:33)
all of your crystals like every weekend (62:30 - 62:36)
yeah it was part of the huge 90s New Age (62:33 - 62:38)
Resurgence was the was the big dolphin (62:36 - 62:41)
peace love and then Echo the dolphin (62:38 - 62:42)
came out and that game ruined it for (62:41 - 62:44)
everybody because the Screech it made (62:42 - 62:47)
when it hit when it hit rocks was awful (62:44 - 62:48)
laughs (62:47 - 62:50)
uh (62:48 - 62:51)
yeah I thought about that the other day (62:50 - 62:53)
I was like wow everyone was like really (62:51 - 62:55)
into Dolphins at one point that was (62:53 - 62:58)
weird that was a time to be alive (62:55 - 63:02)
the 90s was wild (62:58 - 63:02)
uh so we are uh about a month away from (63:03 - 63:08)
scarlet and violet (63:06 - 63:10)
I (63:08 - 63:13)
I would expect us to get like at least (63:10 - 63:16)
one more trailer (63:13 - 63:18)
um and then I would expect like a (63:16 - 63:20)
trailer the week of but that usually the (63:18 - 63:22)
trailer of the week of is like all the (63:20 - 63:24)
trailers like chopped and edited into (63:22 - 63:27)
like the the super trailer please buy (63:24 - 63:29)
our game trailer (63:27 - 63:32)
um oh you know the one thing the one (63:29 - 63:34)
thing I I was thinking of is because (63:32 - 63:36)
people keep asking about like when are (63:34 - 63:39)
they going to show the middle evolution (63:36 - 63:39)
they during our our Hands-On preview uh (63:39 - 63:46)
it said that I started with a quaxley (63:44 - 63:48)
like quaxi was my starter Pokemon if you (63:46 - 63:49)
only went to my train when I went to my (63:48 - 63:51)
trainer card to like go save the game (63:49 - 63:52)
and said like your starters correctly (63:51 - 63:53)
wait I think sword shield did too I (63:52 - 63:54)
think sword and shield was like your (63:53 - 63:57)
starter is grooky (63:54 - 64:00)
there was no quacks lead to be found (63:57 - 64:05)
um in my in my PC or in my my party (64:00 - 64:08)
and they were definitely okay with us (64:05 - 64:10)
seeing new Pokemon I saw a handful of (64:08 - 64:11)
Pokemon that (64:10 - 64:14)
they're like you can't talk about (64:11 - 64:15)
um and they were very strict about like (64:14 - 64:19)
you can't talk about this dialogue you (64:15 - 64:22)
can't you can't talk about this uh when (64:19 - 64:24)
cloth runs away from you do not Chase it (64:22 - 64:27)
right they could have easily said like (64:24 - 64:29)
don't talk about the starters middle (64:27 - 64:31)
Evolutions they could have just said (64:29 - 64:33)
that like they would have been the same (64:31 - 64:35)
agreement of like don't talk about this (64:33 - 64:37)
character's dialogue it's hard if you (64:35 - 64:39)
could use it in your party and it was a (64:37 - 64:42)
key point of your experience in playing (64:39 - 64:44)
the game and then you say and I use this (64:42 - 64:46)
Pokemon which I can't say right they (64:44 - 64:48)
only wanted to give you Pokemon that you (64:46 - 64:51)
could say yeah I mean when I said when I (64:48 - 64:53)
noticed belly bolt was in the party they (64:51 - 64:53)
were like (64:53 - 64:57)
this is iono's Pokemon and we're like (64:53 - 64:58)
the trailer for that will come out like (64:57 - 65:00)
this Friday and we wouldn't be we (64:58 - 65:01)
couldn't talk about until the Friday (65:00 - 65:04)
afterwards so it's like oh okay (65:01 - 65:05)
um (65:04 - 65:09)
but yeah there was I I (65:05 - 65:11)
us there there's I don't think there's a (65:09 - 65:12)
Pokemon game that hasn't leaked early (65:11 - 65:15)
and I know a lot of people will at least (65:12 - 65:16)
want to look at the leaks to see what (65:15 - 65:19)
their their starter evolves into but I (65:16 - 65:20)
don't know if they're gonna like show it (65:19 - 65:23)
early like with the hasuian forms (65:20 - 65:26)
decidueye yeah those came out before the (65:23 - 65:26)
game (65:26 - 65:28)
no they showed those the day the game (65:26 - 65:30)
came out (65:28 - 65:31)
they were they put them on pokemon.com (65:30 - 65:35)
the the day the game came out (65:31 - 65:39)
um and I want to say for like thwacky (65:35 - 65:43)
rat Boot and drizzle that was like the (65:39 - 65:45)
also the day the game came out but they (65:43 - 65:47)
didn't I mean like that player's guide (65:45 - 65:49)
leaked for sword and shields so that's (65:47 - 65:51)
why so that got (65:49 - 65:54)
oh this is also my uh weekly reminder (65:51 - 65:57)
please do not link me to links (65:54 - 66:00)
I don't care about spoilers but I don't (65:57 - 66:02)
like supporting any of the current (66:00 - 66:04)
leakers out there because I don't think (66:02 - 66:06)
they have anybody's best interest in (66:04 - 66:08)
mind I will find stuff out on my own (66:06 - 66:11)
when I want to find out about it please (66:08 - 66:15)
do not link me or mention me or at me in (66:11 - 66:17)
any of the social medias that link to (66:15 - 66:19)
Links thank you this is this is what I (66:17 - 66:20)
will also say about leaks I said this (66:19 - 66:22)
I've said this a couple times on my (66:20 - 66:24)
twitch stream everyone laughs I posted a (66:22 - 66:27)
video of like me in the shower like all (66:24 - 66:29)
sad it was a I I filmed it a long time (66:27 - 66:31)
ago I just received footage reuse (66:29 - 66:34)
footage yeah yeah and the the joke was (66:31 - 66:36)
like when they haven't shown your (66:34 - 66:37)
favorite Pokemon yet which Greg can (66:36 - 66:40)
relate to oh it's killing me but I don't (66:37 - 66:42)
want to know and I was I was wearing a (66:40 - 66:44)
creme Ranch shirt and then the caption (66:42 - 66:47)
was like show cramerant please right and (66:44 - 66:49)
for whatever reason on on both Tick Tock (66:47 - 66:50)
and Instagram people took that as (66:49 - 66:52)
Liberty to just like talk about the (66:50 - 66:55)
leaks so I I would say like if if the (66:52 - 66:57)
the video is not even worth you checking (66:55 - 67:00)
out like it's just a meme video (66:57 - 67:01)
um but don't read the comments if you (67:00 - 67:03)
don't want to be spoiled but the thing I (67:01 - 67:05)
will say and I promise you you don't (67:03 - 67:07)
have to turn off the audio here the the (67:05 - 67:11)
the tick tock people were all like hey I (67:07 - 67:14)
read the I read the leaks I hate to (67:11 - 67:16)
break it too man cramerant didn't make (67:14 - 67:16)
it (67:16 - 67:18)
and then I went over to the Instagram (67:16 - 67:21)
and and it was wild because the (67:18 - 67:22)
Instagram comments were like hey I read (67:21 - 67:24)
the leaks I hate to break it to you or I (67:22 - 67:27)
I read the leaks I hope this makes your (67:24 - 67:29)
day cramerant's in the game (67:27 - 67:32)
and it's just (67:29 - 67:37)
why it's just wild to me that like there (67:32 - 67:39)
were there there were so many people it (67:37 - 67:41)
wasn't like one person right it wasn't (67:39 - 67:43)
like one person on my Instagram was like (67:41 - 67:44)
Hey I read the leak it was Cameron and (67:43 - 67:46)
it wasn't like it was like one person on (67:44 - 67:49)
my ticket it was so many people that (67:46 - 67:52)
were commenting like like the leaks say (67:49 - 67:53)
kramarine is in and then other people (67:52 - 67:55)
were like the leaks they cram around (67:53 - 67:57)
it's not in so I always find it funny (67:55 - 67:59)
that there's there's a handful of people (67:57 - 68:02)
out there that that live and die by (67:59 - 68:03)
these leaks they like think they're like (68:02 - 68:05)
set in stone (68:03 - 68:08)
um one of the things that I I found (68:05 - 68:10)
interesting because I did see some leaks (68:08 - 68:12)
early on and again you don't have to (68:10 - 68:13)
turn it off I promise you because when I (68:12 - 68:15)
played the game (68:13 - 68:17)
I went to character customization and (68:15 - 68:18)
there were a bunch of different clothes (68:17 - 68:20)
right I could change the shoes the Hat (68:18 - 68:22)
the gloves the backpack and there were (68:20 - 68:26)
four school uniforms and (68:22 - 68:30)
um IGN and Serebii and myself that we (68:26 - 68:32)
were told that there are more clothes in (68:30 - 68:33)
the game (68:32 - 68:36)
but the leaker originally said a couple (68:33 - 68:38)
months ago that there was only uniforms (68:36 - 68:41)
you couldn't actually change that (68:38 - 68:45)
but but the point is (68:41 - 68:45)
people only remember what the leaker (68:45 - 68:51)
says right they never remember the the (68:48 - 68:54)
multiple things they get wrong just (68:51 - 68:56)
constantly (68:54 - 68:58)
so uh tune in for Will and I's new (68:56 - 69:02)
podcast called confirmation bias yeah (68:58 - 69:06)
where we cover all this stuff (69:02 - 69:09)
um and so like (69:06 - 69:12)
four weeks I mean if there's a pokedex (69:09 - 69:13)
leak I'll probably look at it we will (69:12 - 69:15)
not talk about in the show unless it's (69:13 - 69:17)
after credits (69:15 - 69:20)
um but yeah uh just you know I'm super (69:17 - 69:22)
excited for these games uh people (69:20 - 69:25)
commented on the YouTube video that my (69:22 - 69:26)
preview of the games made them more (69:25 - 69:28)
excited so that's that's great to hear (69:26 - 69:33)
uh and yeah I'm really glad that (69:28 - 69:35)
uh there's a lot of positivity around (69:33 - 69:36)
these games compared to sword and shield (69:35 - 69:38)
because I remember reporting on sword (69:36 - 69:39)
and shield and it just like felt like a (69:38 - 69:42)
nightmare every episode (69:39 - 69:42)
time where people were calling us chills (69:44 - 69:49)
and we were too positive I know here's (69:46 - 69:51)
