[Applause] (0:12 - 0:22)
[Music] (0:13 - 0:25)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:22 - 0:29)
553 episode episode (0:25 - 0:29)
great start perfect look we recorded (0:31 - 0:37)
this shortly after the the last episode (0:35 - 0:41)
because I'm out of town so pretend that (0:37 - 0:43)
this is the same week uh I'm your host (0:41 - 0:45)
Steve with me is Hannah (0:43 - 0:49)
hello I am I am still right here nothing (0:45 - 0:51)
new sorry (0:49 - 0:51)
for the audio listeners Hannah is uh in (0:53 - 0:58)
uh uh Germany this week uh (0:55 - 1:00)
I wish (0:58 - 1:02)
laughs (1:00 - 1:05)
um Bobby also here (1:02 - 1:06)
yep not (1:05 - 1:10)
haven't moved I I'm sorry I do two (1:06 - 1:12)
podcasts at once everyone's so (1:10 - 1:14)
enthusiastic (1:12 - 1:14)
um so uh if if if there was Pokemon news (1:18 - 1:27)
the week of the Hoenn Vegas go Fest tour (1:22 - 1:29)
thingy uh and you're like why aren't we (1:27 - 1:30)
talking about it it's because this was (1:29 - 1:34)
recorded early and I was at Vegas and if (1:30 - 1:36)
you want my thoughts of Vegas there'll (1:34 - 1:38)
probably be a separate episode for that (1:36 - 1:40)
um but because I'm traveling on the (1:38 - 1:41)
Monday and the podcast comes out on (1:40 - 1:43)
Monday we have to record early (1:41 - 1:45)
uh but that's okay because I don't think (1:43 - 1:47)
the plans for the podcast would have (1:45 - 1:50)
changed uh this episode is coming out on (1:47 - 1:54)
February 20th and ideally uh Pokemon day (1:50 - 1:56)
well not ideally like technically (1:54 - 2:01)
Pokemon day is the 27th so one week (1:56 - 2:02)
um (2:01 - 2:04)
after (2:02 - 2:06)
and this is our last week to speculate (2:04 - 2:09)
what we think is gonna happen uh I'm (2:06 - 2:12)
sure 90 of that will be wrong but there (2:09 - 2:14)
are always fun episodes to go of like (2:12 - 2:17)
what we want what we don't want (2:14 - 2:19)
um how many times will people guess (2:17 - 2:21)
Pokemon sleep is coming and then be (2:19 - 2:23)
disappointed uh there's a lot that can (2:21 - 2:25)
happen (2:23 - 2:28)
and on top of that uh I guess (2:25 - 2:29)
technically as of this recording we (2:28 - 2:30)
don't even know if there's going to be (2:29 - 2:32)
like a video announcement or something (2:30 - 2:34)
like that we don't know if there's going (2:32 - 2:35)
to be a Pokemon presence (2:34 - 2:41)
right I'm sure there will be uh but who (2:35 - 2:43)
knows also we don't know if that's gonna (2:41 - 2:48)
be like 6 a.m California time or uh 6 (2:43 - 2:51)
p.m because Japan I don't know don't (2:48 - 2:53)
know (2:51 - 2:55)
what that's looking like but Pokemon day (2:53 - 2:58)
is Monday February 27th (2:55 - 3:01)
um so this episode will just be a (2:58 - 3:03)
speculation (3:01 - 3:05)
um and who knows maybe by the time we (3:03 - 3:07)
record this they'll be like hey we're (3:05 - 3:10)
announcing DLC we'll show you more on (3:07 - 3:12)
Pokemon like I don't know (3:10 - 3:15)
I guess we can start there though (3:12 - 3:18)
um I guess it's safe to start with the (3:15 - 3:21)
obvious or what I guess everyone thinks (3:18 - 3:25)
is that they're going to show DLC for (3:21 - 3:28)
scarlet and violet that would ideally (3:25 - 3:30)
either come out in the same time frame (3:28 - 3:32)
of the sword and shield DLC which would (3:30 - 3:36)
have been June and then November (3:32 - 3:37)
um or (3:36 - 3:39)
I saw somebody suggest what if there (3:37 - 3:42)
isn't two DLCs and it's just one big DLC (3:39 - 3:45)
for November which I didn't really think (3:42 - 3:46)
of but after they said that whether (3:45 - 3:48)
they're right or wrong (3:46 - 3:50)
uh to me that seems a little more (3:48 - 3:52)
appealing (3:50 - 3:53)
um (3:52 - 3:55)
what do you think where do you think (3:53 - 3:58)
Pokemon stands in uh (3:55 - 4:01)
facing off with uh Zelda (3:58 - 4:05)
because like I don't see them right in (4:01 - 4:08)
November to just like (4:05 - 4:11)
keep clear of Zelda like Zelda's late (4:08 - 4:12)
May right it's the it's the end of May (4:11 - 4:14)
yeah so (4:12 - 4:16)
I could see them do that for that but (4:14 - 4:19)
also Pokemon is its own gigantic (4:16 - 4:22)
thing so that may not even be (4:19 - 4:26)
uh a thought in their mind (4:22 - 4:28)
yeah I remember when auras came out the (4:26 - 4:32)
same day as uh Super Smash Brothers (4:28 - 4:34)
sprawl (4:32 - 4:36)
whatever one was on the Wii U (4:34 - 4:37)
I remember those coming out in the same (4:36 - 4:40)
exact day and me being like boy I (4:37 - 4:43)
dislike both of these games (4:40 - 4:43)
[Laughter] (4:44 - 4:47)
ouch (4:45 - 4:47)
um (4:48 - 4:52)
well there was a Pokemon game pretty (4:50 - 4:53)
close to (4:52 - 4:56)
Links A Link Between Worlds which I (4:53 - 5:00)
think was also November or December (4:56 - 5:04)
that's not that's yeah (5:00 - 5:04)
it's not a 70 uh switch game yeah (5:04 - 5:10)
they're so confident breath of the wild (5:08 - 5:13)
they stuck an extra ten dollars on that (5:10 - 5:14)
okay (5:13 - 5:17)
I I thought I was thinking about other (5:14 - 5:18)
games (5:17 - 5:22)
um and again I don't there there's so (5:18 - 5:24)
many things that (5:22 - 5:26)
went wrong or not went wrong that were (5:24 - 5:28)
just different outside of the Video Game (5:26 - 5:29)
World (5:28 - 5:32)
because of the pandemic that recently (5:29 - 5:35)
happened right so pandemic happened at (5:32 - 5:38)
the end of what March I think uh early (5:35 - 5:42)
April and then people were stuck at home (5:38 - 5:45)
work at home began uh I remember myself (5:42 - 5:47)
I was streaming a lot more because (5:45 - 5:49)
people were at home (5:47 - 5:51)
and or people were laid off or for a (5:49 - 5:52)
load (5:51 - 5:55)
and I remember Isle of armor just being (5:52 - 5:57)
such a huge deal (5:55 - 6:01)
uh at least you know in my circles (5:57 - 6:02)
and you could maybe say the same thing (6:01 - 6:05)
about Animal Crossing huge deal have no (6:02 - 6:07)
we will probably never know whether you (6:05 - 6:08)
know Animal Crossing would have been (6:07 - 6:11)
this big of a success if the pandemic (6:08 - 6:13)
didn't happen right like (6:11 - 6:15)
I think I think most people agree that (6:13 - 6:17)
the pandemic definitely helped (6:15 - 6:19)
but then when the crown Tundra came out (6:17 - 6:21)
and I think Hannah and Greg and I kind (6:19 - 6:22)
of touched on this a week or two ago it (6:21 - 6:24)
just didn't feel like (6:22 - 6:28)
it was as exciting as the Isle of armor (6:24 - 6:30)
maybe because it was the second DLC and (6:28 - 6:32)
not the first DLC and even in other (6:30 - 6:34)
games whether that's like Destiny or (6:32 - 6:37)
Monster Hunter or (6:34 - 6:39)
um Hitman I'm trying to think of games (6:37 - 6:41)
I've recently played (6:39 - 6:43)
um I feel like little DLCs or little (6:41 - 6:44)
updates (6:43 - 6:47)
I always I think to myself as a player (6:44 - 6:49)
like ah not that big of a deal like cool (6:47 - 6:51)
it's very cool that they're updating it (6:49 - 6:52)
or Monster Hunter oh cool they're adding (6:51 - 6:54)
like two new monsters and like a new (6:52 - 6:55)
armor set okay (6:54 - 6:58)
but (6:55 - 6:58)
I think (6:59 - 7:04)
if it was like a bigger substantial DLC (7:01 - 7:05)
with a bunch of marketing and they (7:04 - 7:07)
really hyped it up I felt I feel like (7:05 - 7:10)
that would push players more to pull the (7:07 - 7:12)
trigger or to drop everything to come (7:10 - 7:14)
back to that game and I don't think they (7:12 - 7:17)
did a good job with crown Tundra (7:14 - 7:19)
um (7:17 - 7:19)
and so if they are going to do two DLCs (7:19 - 7:24)
I don't know I I guess I I want the (7:25 - 7:30)
excitement behind both of them I feel (7:27 - 7:31)
like there's the potential for that (7:30 - 7:34)
though yeah there's the whole I mean I (7:31 - 7:37)
keep saying this the story leaves part (7:34 - 7:40)
of it unsolved there is a whole section (7:37 - 7:43)
of the story of the background of what's (7:40 - 7:44)
going on with the crystals what's going (7:43 - 7:47)
on with the third legendary that we (7:44 - 7:49)
haven't gotten in these games yet (7:47 - 7:52)
and I'm super excited for it and I think (7:49 - 7:54)
that they could Market that (7:52 - 7:57)
to make this DLC big (7:54 - 7:59)
yeah because with sword and shield we (7:57 - 8:00)
kind of had everything was like answered (7:59 - 8:02)
when it came to (8:00 - 8:04)
well as much as it could be in sword and (8:02 - 8:07)
shield yeah what happened to Russ why (8:04 - 8:09)
did he feel the need to not wait a (8:07 - 8:14)
single 12 hours for his energy crisis (8:09 - 8:14)
more so though than what we've like been (8:14 - 8:19)
given and we've been given more in (8:16 - 8:22)
scarlet and violet to to want versus I (8:19 - 8:25)
think with sword and shield yeah so that (8:22 - 8:27)
makes sense (8:25 - 8:29)
um but how did you guys feel about the (8:27 - 8:32)
uh how did you feel about the breath of (8:29 - 8:33)
the wild DLC if you did that because (8:32 - 8:36)
that was also two parts and I feel like (8:33 - 8:38)
the first part I was into and then I (8:36 - 8:39)
never really got into the second part of (8:38 - 8:42)
the DLC and I feel like it was the same (8:39 - 8:43)
it was like the marketing was all toward (8:42 - 8:46)
the beginning and yeah I did feel very (8:43 - 8:48)
similar to the breath of the wild DLC (8:46 - 8:50)
just like the Pokemon DLC yeah and then (8:48 - 8:51)
they had once they had everyone's money (8:50 - 8:53)
because everyone bought it for the first (8:51 - 8:54)
part (8:53 - 8:57)
why remark why Market as hard for the (8:54 - 8:58)
second part because you already got a (8:57 - 8:59)
bunch of people's money on that first (8:58 - 9:03)
part yeah uh another game that stood out (8:59 - 9:04)
to me is like the Fallout games where (9:03 - 9:06)
they do they do like (9:04 - 9:10)
you could I it was it was it Fallout (9:06 - 9:12)
New Vegas that had like four (9:10 - 9:15)
like smaller DLCs like one was an alien (9:12 - 9:17)
one was a (9:15 - 9:19)
an old western one or something and I (9:17 - 9:21)
was like man the first one seems great (9:19 - 9:22)
and I was like I don't know about the (9:21 - 9:24)
second third or fourth and then the (9:22 - 9:26)
first one came and I was like ah and (9:24 - 9:28)
then I missed it and then I felt like a (9:26 - 9:29)
month later I was like (9:28 - 9:31)
I moved on I moved on to different games (9:29 - 9:34)
yeah and I wonder if that was like the (9:31 - 9:35)
the because I did the same thing for (9:34 - 9:36)
breath of the wild like they marketed (9:35 - 9:37)
the first one I was like yeah there's (9:36 - 9:39)
some things that are interesting here (9:37 - 9:40)
and then I was like the second one (9:39 - 9:42)
doesn't seem as good or it was flipped (9:40 - 9:44)
one of the two where I was like ah one (9:42 - 9:45)
of these seemed more interesting than (9:44 - 9:47)
the other ones (9:45 - 9:51)
and but by the time I was like um should (9:47 - 9:52)
I get it I already moved on to different (9:51 - 9:55)
games (9:52 - 9:55)
DLC I missed the first round I missed (9:58 - 10:02)
the hype for it I was working on (10:01 - 10:05)
graduating college (10:02 - 10:07)
so that was that was not in my realm of (10:05 - 10:09)
what I was doing at that point in time (10:07 - 10:11)
and I didn't get to do the Isle of armor (10:09 - 10:14)
as it was coming out I went and got the (10:11 - 10:16)
Slowpoke and didn't touch that game (10:14 - 10:18)
again for months and then when Crown (10:16 - 10:20)
Tundra came out (10:18 - 10:22)
it felt like (10:20 - 10:25)
there was hype around it for me it did (10:22 - 10:27)
get me back into it it got me to do both (10:25 - 10:30)
of the DLCs at that time there was that (10:27 - 10:32)
whole video where they revealed the the (10:30 - 10:33)
gallerian birds and that was super (10:32 - 10:37)
exciting that's true (10:33 - 10:39)
um that's true yeah I don't know and and (10:37 - 10:42)
the Dynamax Adventures I didn't end up (10:39 - 10:44)
doing a ton of them but I was excited (10:42 - 10:46)
about them (10:44 - 10:48)
yeah I will say like Crown Tundra I (10:46 - 10:50)
think has more replayability or not even (10:48 - 10:53)
replayability but like it the crown (10:50 - 10:54)
Tundra stuff keeps you is what is keep (10:53 - 10:56)
it keeps people coming back what keep (10:54 - 10:57)
kept people coming back because of those (10:56 - 11:00)
Dynamics Adventures so I will like you (10:57 - 11:02)
know that was but as far as the DLCs (11:00 - 11:06)
themselves I think I just liked the for (11:02 - 11:07)
one I liked the look of Isle of armor (11:06 - 11:10)
more I liked the more like Island kind (11:07 - 11:14)
of like feel of the the well that fact (11:10 - 11:15)
that it was like like an island and (11:14 - 11:17)
there was like ocean and everything and (11:15 - 11:18)
all of that versus like the crown Tundra (11:17 - 11:20)
but (11:18 - 11:22)
um I guess it is like the crown Tundra (11:20 - 11:24)
that kept me playing longer because I (11:22 - 11:25)
was doing all the Dynamax adventures and (11:24 - 11:27)
everything so (11:25 - 11:30)
yeah I don't know I still feel like one (11:27 - 11:32)
big DLC would be kind of cool to see in (11:30 - 11:33)
November versus like breaking it up into (11:32 - 11:35)
but (11:33 - 11:36)
um (11:35 - 11:39)
it could it could go either way I guess (11:36 - 11:40)

yeah I don't think I would be upset if (12:32 - 12:35)
they did (12:34 - 12:38)
two if they did like a June November (12:35 - 12:39)
thing again I don't think that I I (12:38 - 12:41)
obviously wouldn't be upset I think I (12:39 - 12:43)
would like to see them do one DLC I (12:41 - 12:45)
would like to see what that that feels (12:43 - 12:47)
like I would like to see (12:45 - 12:51)
if not needing to put something out in (12:47 - 12:54)
June and like giving it more time to (12:51 - 12:58)
incubate and having a lot more of like (12:54 - 13:00)
we added a bunch of stuff and like (12:58 - 13:03)
instead of I'm sure I mean like (13:00 - 13:04)
deadlines are helpful but I'm sure it (13:03 - 13:06)
was like okay well we got to put all (13:04 - 13:08)
this stuff into Isle of armor we gotta (13:06 - 13:11)
get this out the door and then it's like (13:08 - 13:13)
let's hurry up and get Crown Tundra done (13:11 - 13:15)
versus like oh we should we forgot this (13:13 - 13:17)
of Eye of armor we forgot this like this (13:15 - 13:19)
didn't work out whereas if they had like (13:17 - 13:21)
a more time to like we're putting (13:19 - 13:23)
together this whole package and we're (13:21 - 13:25)
gonna present this whole thing (13:23 - 13:26)
I would like to see that I don't know if (13:25 - 13:28)
that's better (13:26 - 13:30)
um uh but I would like to at least see (13:28 - 13:32)
them try (13:30 - 13:34)
I have a feeling it would be rushed (13:32 - 13:37)
either way yeah uh yeah I mean like (13:34 - 13:39)
right now (13:37 - 13:41)
the thing I want the most is stability (13:39 - 13:44)
and frame rate and for the game to run (13:41 - 13:48)
well so it's it like that (13:44 - 13:51)
you know whatever comes for Pokemon day (13:48 - 13:52)
they said there's going to be a February (13:51 - 13:55)
update and I hope that February update (13:52 - 13:58)
makes the game Run significantly better (13:55 - 14:01)
um less crashes all that stuff (13:58 - 14:03)
um because if we're still in (14:01 - 14:06)
the state the game is now (14:03 - 14:08)
um (14:06 - 14:10)
it'll be a little hard for me to be (14:08 - 14:12)
excited because it's like I just I just (14:10 - 14:14)
want the game to run (14:12 - 14:15)
you know I just don't want to be stuck (14:14 - 14:17)
in a raid menu when I'm trying to do (14:15 - 14:18)
Greninja and I was like oh we failed (14:17 - 14:20)
this Greninja because I literally was I (14:18 - 14:23)
couldn't do anything do anything right (14:20 - 14:27)
um if they do fix the problems in (14:23 - 14:29)
February uh (14:27 - 14:32)
that might be a good reason for DLC to (14:29 - 14:33)
come out in like sooner than later (14:32 - 14:36)
because it may it's like (14:33 - 14:38)
people played it in November and it was (14:36 - 14:39)
buggy and it was they had this (14:38 - 14:41)
experience that they had and now if they (14:39 - 14:43)
didn't come out with a DLC until a full (14:41 - 14:45)
year later but they fixed a lot of the (14:43 - 14:47)
things in February it's like fixing (14:45 - 14:49)
things maybe like okay now let's bring (14:47 - 14:51)
people back like sooner than later to to (14:49 - 14:53)
Play It Again to keep playing and then (14:51 - 14:55)
realize that it's like good now versus (14:53 - 14:56)
people who finish the game and it was (14:55 - 14:59)
all buggy maybe like oh and then they (14:56 - 15:01)
fix all the things and people are like (14:59 - 15:03)
well I already like beat it like I don't (15:01 - 15:04)
want you know and I won't touch it till (15:03 - 15:06)
November when the DLC comes out this may (15:04 - 15:08)
be a chance to be like no no come back (15:06 - 15:10)
in June you'll see it's actually better (15:08 - 15:12)
like we promise it's better and then you (15:10 - 15:13)
know that could lead into like a (15:12 - 15:14)
two-part I mean I know that that's (15:13 - 15:16)
probably the deadlines have already been (15:14 - 15:18)
set for these things but it would (15:16 - 15:20)
potentially be helpful to like bring (15:18 - 15:21)
people back in once they've fixed things (15:20 - 15:23)
I feel like they might be relying on the (15:21 - 15:26)
raids to do that though yeah yeah I (15:23 - 15:28)
don't I don't know if you could probably (15:26 - 15:30)
make the case for both uh like a summer (15:28 - 15:35)
DLC or a big win uh like winter DLC but (15:30 - 15:36)
I think the difference between sword and (15:35 - 15:39)
shield in this game is that they do have (15:36 - 15:41)
these raid events that feel pretty like (15:39 - 15:43)
you should come back like you should (15:41 - 15:44)
come back for Greninja you should come (15:43 - 15:45)
back for cinder Ace you should come back (15:44 - 15:48)
for whatever is the fourth raid and the (15:45 - 15:51)
fifth raid and so (15:48 - 15:51)
while while obviously DLC is is more (15:51 - 15:56)
than just rating (15:54 - 15:58)
um (15:56 - 16:01)
it it like if the raids themselves are (15:58 - 16:03)
not bringing you back (16:01 - 16:05)
you're probably you're probably going to (16:03 - 16:07)
need a lot to bring you back (16:05 - 16:10)
um if like we have shiny hunting we have (16:07 - 16:13)
completing your Pokedex we have uh (16:10 - 16:17)
uh competitive we have the raids and we (16:13 - 16:18)
have we have technically two types of (16:17 - 16:20)
raids right we have the Seven Star raids (16:18 - 16:23)
and then we have the in-between raids so (16:20 - 16:24)
that's a lot of reasons for you to (16:23 - 16:25)
continue playing the game like not maybe (16:24 - 16:27)
every day but like maybe like once a (16:25 - 16:30)
week you pick it up or maybe like the (16:27 - 16:32)
Thursdays are your Pokemon day to play (16:30 - 16:35)
Scarlet violet if that if that stuff's (16:32 - 16:37)
not bringing you back (16:35 - 16:39)
it almost feels like such an uphill (16:37 - 16:41)
battle to be like okay well this DLC (16:39 - 16:42)
will bring you back (16:41 - 16:45)
hopefully fingers crossed like give us (16:42 - 16:48)
money and come back like I I do think (16:45 - 16:50)
they have to lay down that Foundation of (16:48 - 16:53)
we're giving you content throughout the (16:50 - 16:54)
year (16:53 - 16:56)
and you're going to come back and it's (16:54 - 16:59)
free and it's good and it's new and I do (16:56 - 17:00)
think they're doing a good job of that (16:59 - 17:03)
but I do but I mean with the big (17:00 - 17:05)
asterisks of sometimes you get stuck in (17:03 - 17:07)
raid minis sometimes you just fall (17:05 - 17:09)
through the floor sometimes you you're (17:07 - 17:10)
just standing there and you go to the (17:09 - 17:11)
bathroom and you come back after five (17:10 - 17:12)
minutes and you pick up your controller (17:11 - 17:14)
and then your game just randomly crashes (17:12 - 17:15)
and you're like I wasn't even doing (17:14 - 17:17)
anything I was just standing here not (17:15 - 17:18)
that that happened to me like four times (17:17 - 17:21)
last week but all of those things are (17:18 - 17:24)
currently happening so you're doing the (17:21 - 17:26)
raids and it's buggy you're doing the (17:24 - 17:27)
competitive well I don't know how the (17:26 - 17:29)
competitors going you're doing this and (17:27 - 17:31)
it's bugging you're doing the uh story (17:29 - 17:34)
and it's buggy so if they just fix the (17:31 - 17:35)
problems (17:34 - 17:37)
but they've already dealt with a giant (17:35 - 17:38)
amount of people who have already gone (17:37 - 17:39)
through these things like raids and (17:38 - 17:41)
things like that so are people going to (17:39 - 17:43)
come back to the raids now that they're (17:41 - 17:45)
not buggy I don't know I'm sure there's (17:43 - 17:47)
a raid that would bring people back I am (17:45 - 17:49)
sure there is an exciting big Seven Star (17:47 - 17:51)
raid that they might announce on Pokemon (17:49 - 17:54)
day that will bring people back well (17:51 - 17:55)
then they gotta lean it all into one (17:54 - 17:57)
weekend in hoping that that Ray does not (17:55 - 18:00)
break it like because two separate (17:57 - 18:02)
weekends yeah two separate weekends (18:00 - 18:04)
versus versus putting out a DLC in the (18:02 - 18:06)
Summer where it's like this is a DLC and (18:04 - 18:09)
now now I guess if it's a paid DLC you (18:06 - 18:10)
might want to have some stuff in there (18:09 - 18:12)
beforehand that would get people to want (18:10 - 18:13)
to pay more money for this so I guess (18:12 - 18:17)
there is that factor as well but I think (18:13 - 18:18)
um (18:17 - 18:20)
what you what you do (18:18 - 18:23)
I'm not I'm not a a million billion (18:20 - 18:24)
dollar business like the Pokemon company (18:23 - 18:27)
but I think you don't have to Market (18:24 - 18:31)
that you fixed the game if you just fix (18:27 - 18:33)
it and then you give something that's (18:31 - 18:36)
good enough for people to come back (18:33 - 18:38)
um and (18:36 - 18:41)
I think as much as people dislike (18:38 - 18:43)
Charizard Charizard sells copies people (18:41 - 18:45)
love Charizard it's undoubtedly (18:43 - 18:48)
incredibly popular right so you you open (18:45 - 18:50)
up scarlet and violet with a Charizard (18:48 - 18:52)
raid and I am sure there were people on (18:50 - 18:53)
the fence or people that heard the game (18:52 - 18:56)
was bad but they absolutely love (18:53 - 18:58)
Charizard they wanted to do a super (18:56 - 18:59)
strong Charizard raid they wanted to get (18:58 - 19:01)
Charizard with a unique mark because it (18:59 - 19:03)
felt like an event so I'm sure Charizard (19:01 - 19:05)
helped to sell copies (19:03 - 19:07)
um and Greninja being as popular as (19:05 - 19:10)
Greninja is again I'm sure (19:07 - 19:14)
Greninja helped move copies (19:10 - 19:17)
I would not be surprised what like what (19:14 - 19:19)
Hannah said if there is a special (19:17 - 19:21)
Pokemon that they save for Pokemon day (19:19 - 19:25)
that will without a doubt bring people (19:21 - 19:27)
back whether they remember the game (19:25 - 19:29)
being buggy or not and they update the (19:27 - 19:31)
game before Pokemon day (19:29 - 19:33)
um or the day of Pokemon day and they're (19:31 - 19:35)
like this raid is coming (19:33 - 19:38)
free you can only catch one but like (19:35 - 19:40)
think of what like think of a Pokemon (19:38 - 19:45)
that hasn't even been around like Mewtwo (19:40 - 19:47)
could ease people love like Mewtwo's by (19:45 - 19:49)
far one of the most popular Legends like (19:47 - 19:51)
and and or Rayquaza like those two those (19:49 - 19:54)
two just like looking at Pokemon go data (19:51 - 19:56)
people lose their minds when those (19:54 - 19:59)
Pokemon show up like makes sense Mewtwo (19:56 - 20:02)
is the best legendary thing no arguments (19:59 - 20:04)
there so like it could be like hey and (20:02 - 20:05)
they figured out and they figured out (20:04 - 20:07)
right like you can only catch one you (20:05 - 20:09)
can't like we had Mewtwo in sword and (20:07 - 20:11)
shield it was a very memorable event (20:09 - 20:13)
people love doing Mewtwo you couldn't (20:11 - 20:15)
catch it people would be upset that you (20:13 - 20:16)
couldn't catch it but they were excited (20:15 - 20:18)
to do it like even in that situation you (20:16 - 20:19)
can't even catch it but people are like (20:18 - 20:22)
ah like it was a cool event and then (20:19 - 20:24)
when Isle of armor launched they did (20:22 - 20:26)
Zara Aura and they were like you can do (20:24 - 20:28)
this era Aura if enough trainers do (20:26 - 20:30)
there or I will give you a zero Aura for (20:28 - 20:31)
free through your Pokemon home account (20:30 - 20:35)
that was a whole mess at that (20:31 - 20:38)
that was that was a mess because like (20:35 - 20:40)
people didn't have Pokemon home or like (20:38 - 20:41)
people were like I don't have a phone (20:40 - 20:43)
that could support Pokemon home so I (20:41 - 20:45)
can't get the zero Aura and it's like (20:43 - 20:48)
they're it was the the thought process (20:45 - 20:51)
and the and the event was cool but there (20:48 - 20:53)
were limitations to that (20:51 - 20:55)
um (20:53 - 20:57)
so I could see them doing like a Mewtwo (20:55 - 20:59)
or a Rayquaza because those are two (20:57 - 21:01)
incredibly popular Pokemon that they (20:59 - 21:03)
could celebrate for Pokemon day you go (21:01 - 21:05)
in you catch one if you want to grind it (21:03 - 21:06)
out for rewards like Greninja Center is (21:05 - 21:08)
Charizard you can do that it'll bring (21:06 - 21:10)
people back to the game whether they (21:08 - 21:13)
remember it's buggy or not or they could (21:10 - 21:15)
even go like (21:13 - 21:16)
um (21:15 - 21:17)
what's that like a mythical we haven't (21:16 - 21:19)
had in Forever (21:17 - 21:23)
um like not magearna uh diance we (21:19 - 21:24)
haven't had a Diane say distribution (21:23 - 21:28)
since 2016 if I remember correctly (21:24 - 21:30)
um and they could even go farther just (21:28 - 21:31)
like their Aura and they could be like (21:30 - 21:34)
hey diance is in raids this weekend it's (21:31 - 21:35)
also shiny like this is your one chance (21:34 - 21:37)
to get shiny Diane say we've never (21:35 - 21:39)
released it before Victini is another (21:37 - 21:40)
one they have never released shiny (21:39 - 21:43)
Victini bikinis in raids this weekend or (21:40 - 21:44)
these two weekends you can only catch (21:43 - 21:47)
one you can catch a shiny one like that (21:44 - 21:50)
Not only would bring people who have (21:47 - 21:51)
bought the game back even if that game (21:50 - 21:53)
had like a oh gosh what a buggy bad (21:51 - 21:56)
experience still bring them back because (21:53 - 21:57)
like I want a shiny Victini right or I (21:56 - 22:00)
want a shiny me too or I want a Rayquaza (21:57 - 22:04)
um but I think alone that just sells (22:00 - 22:05)
copies right (22:04 - 22:07)
like oh shiny Victini is my favorite (22:05 - 22:09)
this is the first way to get it legal I (22:07 - 22:10)
guess I'm buying scarlet and violet this (22:09 - 22:12)
weekend because I want shiny Victini (22:10 - 22:15)
yeah I I will say I agree with all of (22:12 - 22:18)
that the two the two things that I do (22:15 - 22:19)
wonder is (22:18 - 22:21)
they've never released shiny Victini (22:19 - 22:24)
before this bugginess of this game is (22:21 - 22:26)
not planned are they is the Pokemon (22:24 - 22:28)
company willing to for something that (22:26 - 22:29)
they haven't released for whatever (22:28 - 22:32)
reason have not released for you know as (22:29 - 22:34)
much time as it's been is this a big (22:32 - 22:36)
enough problem to need to do something (22:34 - 22:39)
that's big like they clearly haven't (22:36 - 22:40)
released it for some reason at all in (22:39 - 22:42)
all these years is this something where (22:40 - 22:44)
it's like okay well emergency plan here (22:42 - 22:46)
we're gonna do something like that to (22:44 - 22:50)
bring people back but also second (22:46 - 22:51)
I think that something will get said (22:50 - 22:53)
maybe not like huge marketing but (22:51 - 22:55)
because not because of nintendent (22:53 - 22:57)
Niantic because (22:55 - 22:59)
we're talking about buggy things it's (22:57 - 23:00)
usually Niantic so that's just the (22:59 - 23:03)
default and I had to increase their (23:00 - 23:04)
frame rate in Pokemon go if anything (23:03 - 23:07)
Niantic has gotten frame rate down they (23:04 - 23:12)
did they did um no but uh Nintendo did (23:07 - 23:14)
actually say something about fixing (23:12 - 23:16)
about knowing how people are feeling and (23:14 - 23:18)
yeah and so I think they do have to (23:16 - 23:21)
close that Loop in some way by telling (23:18 - 23:23)
people even if like (23:21 - 23:25)
even if it's enough that people could (23:23 - 23:26)
just see it when they play again I do (23:25 - 23:28)
think Nintendo will have to kind of (23:26 - 23:30)
close that loop with people to be like (23:28 - 23:32)
hey we did listen (23:30 - 23:33)
and you know here and it may not be it (23:32 - 23:34)
may just be part of the update right (23:33 - 23:36)
like when they did it before it was a (23:34 - 23:38)
part of an update that was coming out (23:36 - 23:40)
and they said hey we're listening we're (23:38 - 23:42)
hearing you like this is what we're (23:40 - 23:44)
didn't really say what we're planning to (23:42 - 23:46)
do but they did say that they like that (23:44 - 23:48)
they hurt people I guess they didn't (23:46 - 23:49)
even did they even say they were fixing (23:48 - 23:50)
it they just said they heard people but (23:49 - 23:53)
um I think they will close that Loop in (23:50 - 23:55)
some way as well (23:53 - 23:56)
I just don't know if they close that (23:55 - 23:58)
Loop in a presentation (23:56 - 24:00)
I mean Maybe not maybe it's just part of (23:58 - 24:02)
like when they announce the updates (24:00 - 24:04)
coming they also have a note in there (24:02 - 24:07)
like they did with when they first said (24:04 - 24:09)
we hear you you know it could be (24:07 - 24:10)
something small like that but I do think (24:09 - 24:12)
we'll be we'll be told (24:10 - 24:15)
these things are fixed if not only in (24:12 - 24:17)
like the notes of like what's you know (24:15 - 24:19)
coming up but like in some way they're (24:17 - 24:21)
gonna let us know that (24:19 - 24:24)
these things have been worked on I am (24:21 - 24:27)
pretty confident in that I don't know (24:24 - 24:29)
they might they might fix them to a (24:27 - 24:31)
point that's not satisfactory for (24:29 - 24:32)
everyone so they never want to say that (24:31 - 24:35)
it's completely fixed they may need to (24:32 - 24:36)
say it to try to psychologically make (24:35 - 24:37)
people think that it's more fixed than (24:36 - 24:40)
it is to at the same time I mean that's (24:37 - 24:43)
marketing to some extent (24:40 - 24:45)
um I mean scarlet and violet has sold (24:43 - 24:47)
incredibly well it is the fourth (24:45 - 24:50)
best-selling Pokemon game of all time (24:47 - 24:53)
um it is on track (24:50 - 24:56)
I think it's six million copies short of (24:53 - 24:57)
passing (24:56 - 24:58)
sword and shield which is the second (24:57 - 25:00)
best-selling Pokemon game of all time (24:58 - 25:02)
and sword and shield has been out for (25:00 - 25:05)
three years and has had DLC scarlet and (25:02 - 25:07)
violet has been out for three months and (25:05 - 25:10)
it's it's it's very impressive (25:07 - 25:11)
um (25:10 - 25:12)
you know (25:11 - 25:15)
to say that game freak slash the Pokemon (25:12 - 25:17)
company doesn't listen to fans is (25:15 - 25:19)
inherently not it's inherently not true (25:17 - 25:22)
like they knew that fans wanted an open (25:19 - 25:25)
world Pokemon game for a long time (25:22 - 25:28)
and they did it and that in itself was (25:25 - 25:29)
enough to (25:28 - 25:31)
get people to pull the trigger was that (25:29 - 25:33)
the only reason why this game has sold (25:31 - 25:35)
well no they did a bunch of marketing I (25:33 - 25:37)
think the Pokemon designs were strong I (25:35 - 25:38)
think the theming behind it was strong (25:37 - 25:40)
you know what they (25:38 - 25:42)
they marketed a (25:40 - 25:45)
game that people wanted and for some (25:42 - 25:48)
people the graphics the frame rate the (25:45 - 25:51)
story the Poke like first it didn't (25:48 - 25:52)
click with a lot of people right (25:51 - 25:54)
um same for certain Shield you know (25:52 - 25:56)
some people absolutely adore Sergeant (25:54 - 25:57)
Shield some people hate certain Shield (25:56 - 25:59)
right like no Pokemon game is going to (25:57 - 26:03)
be able to appeal to everyone (25:59 - 26:04)
I don't think (26:03 - 26:06)
well I do think we're gonna get seven (26:04 - 26:08)
star raids for like rilla boom and (26:06 - 26:12)
intellion and uh history and Typhlosion (26:08 - 26:14)
or whatever other starters they seem to (26:12 - 26:17)
do I do think we're gonna get raids for (26:14 - 26:19)
legendary Pokemon (26:17 - 26:20)
um (26:19 - 26:22)
because you can only catch one and they (26:20 - 26:24)
figured that out uh but I don't I just (26:22 - 26:26)
don't think them coming out in Pokemon (26:24 - 26:29)
day being like and our next seven star (26:26 - 26:33)
Pokemon is just not like I to the seven (26:29 - 26:35)
people out there that love Chestnut they (26:33 - 26:37)
are gonna be over the moon but Chestnut (26:35 - 26:40)
just does not hold a candle to Greninja (26:37 - 26:44)
or to Charizard like it is just not as (26:40 - 26:48)
exciting as the other starters I'm sorry (26:44 - 26:49)
like I'm not trying to be mean it's just (26:48 - 26:50)
like (26:49 - 26:52)
it's not one of the mass marketable (26:50 - 26:54)
Pokemon it's not what Pokemon are (26:52 - 26:57)
popular and what are not yes just not as (26:54 - 26:59)
not Gengar might be the only other (26:57 - 27:01)
option up there with Mewtwo at this (26:59 - 27:02)
point (27:01 - 27:05)
Mewtwo Rayquaza Gengar (27:02 - 27:08)
um or or any mythical I think fits (27:05 - 27:10)
um any shiny legendary or shiny mythical (27:08 - 27:12)
fits I'm not convinced the shiny (27:10 - 27:13)
mythicals are gonna come out anywhere (27:12 - 27:15)
other than go (27:13 - 27:17)
I only think shiny mythical because of (27:15 - 27:18)
zero Aura (27:17 - 27:19)
um (27:18 - 27:22)
yeah Fair zero Aura was kind of (27:19 - 27:24)
different though (27:22 - 27:26)
it was still new it still hadn't been (27:24 - 27:28)
released fully people hadn't really (27:26 - 27:29)
there was still a lot of people that had (27:28 - 27:32)
no idea it existed but Sarah wasn't (27:29 - 27:34)
there so it came out it came out in gen (27:32 - 27:39)
seven yep doesn't matter like 2017 or 18 (27:34 - 27:41)
or something they could maybe put (27:39 - 27:42)
Volcanion in uh raids and people would (27:41 - 27:45)
be like oh is this a new Pokemon no they (27:42 - 27:48)
just never marketed this thing ever hey (27:45 - 27:49)
volcanion's got a great shiny I will (27:48 - 27:51)
tell you that so there you go shiny (27:49 - 27:52)
Volcanion (27:51 - 27:55)
perfect (27:52 - 27:55)
um yeah I uh but who knows like maybe (27:55 - 28:00)
you know again we're recording this (27:58 - 28:02)
early but it does maybe like five hours (28:00 - 28:04)
after recording this they'll be like the (28:02 - 28:07)
next seven star raid is Delphox like (28:04 - 28:09)
as we're recording this I don't think (28:07 - 28:11)
that takes away though like whether or (28:09 - 28:12)
not they're you know (28:11 - 28:14)
there's a seven star raid coming I still (28:12 - 28:16)
think that (28:14 - 28:19)
they have uh they have this entire life (28:16 - 28:22)
cycle of the game to potentially put (28:19 - 28:24)
legendaries or other special Pokemon (28:22 - 28:26)
into seven star raids where you can only (28:24 - 28:28)
catch one of them they can make it a (28:26 - 28:30)
weekend if you miss that weekend it'll (28:28 - 28:31)
come back in two weeks for one more (28:30 - 28:33)
opportunity (28:31 - 28:36)
um I think that (28:33 - 28:38)
it is a good strategy and it is a good (28:36 - 28:41)
way to keep players coming back to your (28:38 - 28:44)
game even if they took a month break the (28:41 - 28:47)
Seven Star raid events seem (28:44 - 28:47)
good enough to make a Pokemon (28:48 - 28:54)
go well depending on how skilled or not (28:51 - 28:55)
skilled you are I mean we heard for (28:54 - 28:58)
years that Pokemon are is if Pokemon's (28:55 - 28:59)
too easy Pokemon's too easy and now all (28:58 - 29:01)
of a sudden like this is too hard this (28:59 - 29:04)
is too hard like yeah (29:01 - 29:05)
never gonna win with these people right (29:04 - 29:07)
like and part of the problem is like (29:05 - 29:11)
Pokemon is so big right that (29:07 - 29:12)
um (29:11 - 29:15)
it's it's a tough problem to to solve (29:12 - 29:16)
when so many people have different wants (29:15 - 29:18)
and needs from a Pokemon game right I (29:16 - 29:20)
mean like to be clear whenever we talk (29:18 - 29:21)
about this kind of it's different people (29:20 - 29:24)
it's not like the same person it's like (29:21 - 29:25)
this has been too easy and then that (29:24 - 29:27)
person this is way too hard it's (29:25 - 29:29)
different groups of you know it's (29:27 - 29:31)
different people along maybe maybe I'm (29:29 - 29:33)
not saying there aren't any that feel (29:31 - 29:35)
that way but I'm just saying like it (29:33 - 29:37)
does hit so many different groups of (29:35 - 29:39)
people which is a good thing you know (29:37 - 29:41)
that it's that it is open to like so (29:39 - 29:43)
many different groups of people (29:41 - 29:45)
um but yeah you do hear it one way the (29:43 - 29:46)
other you can't like you said you can't (29:45 - 29:47)
make everybody happy unless that (29:46 - 29:49)
person's like this is a children's game (29:47 - 29:51)
why did they make raid so hard and it (29:49 - 29:56)
was like ah this no you can't have both (29:51 - 29:56)
yeah unless it's a child that is saying (29:58 - 30:01)
hey this is a children's game why are (30:00 - 30:04)
they making raids so hard (30:01 - 30:04)
I don't think it's the children that are (30:06 - 30:09)
complaining they got more than enough (30:08 - 30:13)
time in the world to to uh play video (30:09 - 30:15)
games and to look up guides and to build (30:13 - 30:17)
stuff it's I think I I think Greg was (30:15 - 30:18)
right the other way I think it is the (30:17 - 30:19)
adults that are complaining because they (30:18 - 30:21)
don't have enough time (30:19 - 30:22)
um (30:21 - 30:24)
it's fine we we've exhausted that (30:22 - 30:27)
conversation uh again it hits groups it (30:24 - 30:28)
hits all kinds of groups I think that's (30:27 - 30:30)
a good thing in the end I think it does (30:28 - 30:31)
satisfy so many different groups of (30:30 - 30:32)
people (30:31 - 30:34)
uh (30:32 - 30:37)
Pokemon sleep (30:34 - 30:37)
wow all right (30:37 - 30:44)
now we know that (30:40 - 30:47)
is being made by select button (30:44 - 30:52)
select button is a Japanese company they (30:47 - 30:52)
have (30:52 - 30:57)
originally made Magikarp jump (30:54 - 31:01)
uh Pokemon sleep was initially announced (30:57 - 31:06)
on May 28 2019 during a press conference (31:01 - 31:08)
by the CEO of the Pokemon company (31:06 - 31:11)
ishihara and we'll say it was a 6 p.m (31:08 - 31:14)
Pacific Time thank you very much that (31:11 - 31:17)
was a nice nice thing to have and not 6 (31:14 - 31:19)
a.m (31:17 - 31:21)
um there was a date of mine in January (31:19 - 31:23)
of 2022 (31:21 - 31:26)
was a year ago where uh several updates (31:23 - 31:28)
and additions added to the Pokemon Go (31:26 - 31:31)
app showed support for Pokemon sleep (31:28 - 31:34)
that data mine (31:31 - 31:36)
um included (31:34 - 31:40)
uh the Pokemon go plus accessory (31:36 - 31:41)
yes (31:40 - 31:45)
[Laughter] (31:41 - 31:45)
the cleverly named Pokemon go plus plus (31:46 - 31:52)
um (31:51 - 31:56)
there was a SSL certificate registered (31:52 - 31:58)
in April of 2021 (31:56 - 32:02)
and I believe there was an also a recent (31:58 - 32:05)
update uh a month or two ago to Pokemon (32:02 - 32:09)
go to show another Pokemon sleep update (32:05 - 32:11)
now (32:09 - 32:14)
uh (32:11 - 32:14)
I don't know how trustworthy but right (32:15 - 32:20)
I'm saying a date of mine happened I (32:18 - 32:22)
didn't do the date of mine myself I'm (32:20 - 32:24)
just reporting what has you know I'm (32:22 - 32:26)
we're just talking about what other (32:24 - 32:29)
sites have said that the data mine did (32:26 - 32:31)
um but (32:29 - 32:34)
this is 2019 so this is year four this (32:31 - 32:35)
will be the fourth the third Pokemon (32:34 - 32:38)
presents but the technically fourth year (32:35 - 32:40)
that this game has not come out and we (32:38 - 32:42)
have the most promising news on it so (32:40 - 32:43)
far (32:42 - 32:46)
do we think that this is the year that (32:43 - 32:49)
Pokemon sleep comes out I always think (32:46 - 32:51)
this is the year the Pokemon sleep comes (32:49 - 32:52)
out (32:51 - 32:55)
so uh I don't know how into into movies (32:52 - 32:58)
you two are but there's this little (32:55 - 32:59)
known movie called Cloverfield which (32:58 - 33:03)
came out in 2008. and for the next (32:59 - 33:06)
decade I was one of these people I still (33:03 - 33:07)
am one of these people hard hardcore (33:06 - 33:10)
Cloverfield fan the next decade people (33:07 - 33:13)
picked apart every website registered (33:10 - 33:16)
every update everything that could have (33:13 - 33:20)
possibly been some kind of uh hint at a (33:16 - 33:23)
second Cloverfield for a decade before (33:20 - 33:25)
well technically it was like eight years (33:23 - 33:28)
before another Cloverfield movie came (33:25 - 33:30)
out and then in the end of the whole (33:28 - 33:31)
thing (33:30 - 33:32)
it wasn't even connected to the first (33:31 - 33:35)
Cloverfield movie and everyone was (33:32 - 33:36)
disappointed 10 Cloverfield Lane was a (33:35 - 33:38)
great movie but everyone was disciplined (33:36 - 33:40)
at the lack of connection (33:38 - 33:41)
and I feel like that's the same thing (33:40 - 33:43)
that's happening with Pokemon sleep like (33:41 - 33:46)
people are looking for things and it is (33:43 - 33:47)
in the data lines and things like that (33:46 - 33:49)
but I do wonder how much it has changed (33:47 - 33:52)
and how much like it is not what maybe (33:49 - 33:56)
they initially announced in 2000 (33:52 - 34:00)
2019 you said 2019 May of 2019. yeah I (33:56 - 34:02)
feel like things have probably changed (34:00 - 34:04)
with what it was like and I just hope (34:02 - 34:06)
that it is it is as exciting as everyone (34:04 - 34:08)
over the last four years including (34:06 - 34:11)
myself I don't think you can ever reach (34:08 - 34:13)
the excitement of what like people (34:11 - 34:17)
expect it to be exciting in general you (34:13 - 34:20)
add Pokemon to be potentially helpful (34:17 - 34:23)
but but that's the thing like I I think (34:20 - 34:25)
Hannah you have realistic expectations (34:23 - 34:28)
right like like I I have a water app (34:25 - 34:31)
like what like what it does is when I (34:28 - 34:33)
drink water I I put it in the app like (34:31 - 34:36)
this is a this is a 16 ounce bottle this (34:33 - 34:38)
is a 12 ounce can of soda or whatever (34:36 - 34:40)
like you put all your drinks in right (34:38 - 34:41)
and then it takes the water from it (34:40 - 34:43)
because obviously there's not a lot of (34:41 - 34:46)
water and soda compared to pure water (34:43 - 34:48)
and it's very cute very colorful very (34:46 - 34:50)
easy to use supposed to keep you healthy (34:48 - 34:52)
I'm supposed to drink what like 60 (34:50 - 34:53)
ounces of water based on my weight and (34:52 - 34:55)
my height I don't know I I don't know (34:53 - 34:56)
the science right I just trust that the (34:55 - 34:58)
app knows more than I do same with (34:56 - 34:59)
Pokemon sleep (34:58 - 35:02)
I don't expect it to do anything super (34:59 - 35:04)
exciting I expect to get some rewards I (35:02 - 35:06)
expect to put something under my pillow (35:04 - 35:08)
I expect maybe like (35:06 - 35:11)
something will happen in Pokemon go that (35:08 - 35:13)
like I'll unlock something and I unlock (35:11 - 35:15)
like little achievements in this app and (35:13 - 35:16)
it's fun (35:15 - 35:19)
but that but as fun as tracking your (35:16 - 35:22)
water can be right like (35:19 - 35:24)
yeah no I've used three or four (35:22 - 35:26)
different sleep apps over the years so I (35:24 - 35:27)
know that sleep apps are not (35:26 - 35:29)
particularly exciting but they can (35:27 - 35:32)
potentially be helpful and I might have (35:29 - 35:34)
a little bit of excitement with the (35:32 - 35:35)
Pokemon go connection (35:34 - 35:38)
I think it would be really cool just (35:35 - 35:40)
after having said it that week we talked (35:38 - 35:42)
about the patent and everything I think (35:40 - 35:43)
it would be really cool if Pokemon sleep (35:42 - 35:45)
was the way you bred Pokemon from (35:43 - 35:47)
Pokemon go (35:45 - 35:48)
I don't know that that's going to be the (35:47 - 35:51)
thing it's most likely not but I think (35:48 - 35:53)
that would be really cool (35:51 - 35:55)
so there's a little bit of excitement (35:53 - 35:56)
you just said that yeah you just said (35:55 - 36:00)
the Hannah was managing our expectations (35:56 - 36:00)
I I am uh (36:03 - 36:10)
it's just like it it's like the kind of (36:07 - 36:12)
the same energy for (36:10 - 36:14)
um Pokemon Bank (36:12 - 36:16)
where Pokemon bank got delayed and the (36:14 - 36:18)
it was around the time of X and Y so (36:16 - 36:21)
that people use the AZ flow at it's been (36:18 - 36:24)
3 000 years and people were just so mad (36:21 - 36:26)
and they're like I want Pokemon bank and (36:24 - 36:28)
it almost felt like they over hyped (36:26 - 36:30)
their own expectations because I was (36:28 - 36:32)
like my thought process was well I'm (36:30 - 36:34)
gonna move my Pokemon there and then (36:32 - 36:36)
they're not going to do like I'm they're (36:34 - 36:37)
just gonna live there (36:36 - 36:41)
right like I don't what do I expect from (36:37 - 36:43)
this product it's just like it would be (36:41 - 36:44)
like me being excited for like a new (36:43 - 36:46)
Dropbox update like I'm just putting (36:44 - 36:49)
audio files and pictures in my Dropbox (36:46 - 36:54)
like an actual bank like (36:49 - 36:54)
you know oh man (36:54 - 36:57)
I've been counting down (36:58 - 37:03)
but that like it almost feels like the (37:01 - 37:04)
same energy for Pokemon sleep like (37:03 - 37:06)
people are like when is this going to (37:04 - 37:09)
come out like it's been 7 000 years one (37:06 - 37:11)
of the like every Pokemon presents there (37:09 - 37:13)
like when's Pokemon sleep this is gonna (37:11 - 37:15)
be their Pokemon sleep (37:13 - 37:17)
but it's it's just a sleeping app it's (37:15 - 37:20)
like that not that like like (37:17 - 37:22)
I don't expect it to do anything but (37:20 - 37:24)
actually track your sleep and it (37:22 - 37:26)
probably will do that very mediocreally (37:24 - 37:29)
I don't know probably (37:26 - 37:29)
um (37:32 - 37:34)
do you guys remember when like Nintendo (37:35 - 37:41)
showed off at E3 gosh this was like a (37:38 - 37:43)
decade ago the Nintendo Vitality sensor (37:41 - 37:46)
the thing that you put on your finger (37:43 - 37:48)
and that you plugged into like your (37:46 - 37:50)
Nintendo Wii and it was supposed to like (37:48 - 37:52)
measure whatever they measure on your (37:50 - 37:55)
finger blood oxygen yeah probably what (37:52 - 37:57)
you would do on your finger and and some (37:55 - 37:59)
people were like oh my gosh this is so (37:57 - 38:01)
cool like Nintendo's really getting into (37:59 - 38:03)
the health game and then some people are (38:01 - 38:04)
like this is absolutely worthless like (38:03 - 38:06)
this is not a video game and then it (38:04 - 38:08)
just never came out it was just never a (38:06 - 38:10)
thing and I don't even remember if they (38:08 - 38:12)
said they officially canceled it (38:10 - 38:14)
but (38:12 - 38:16)
they can kind of get away with that (38:14 - 38:17)
because (38:16 - 38:19)
like Nintendo makes a bunch of games (38:17 - 38:21)
they have a bunch of internal Studios (38:19 - 38:23)
and they just they're okay with taking (38:21 - 38:24)
as long or as short as they need for a (38:23 - 38:26)
game (38:24 - 38:29)
if if this got canceled (38:26 - 38:31)
how is select button (38:29 - 38:33)
like a float like they're still a (38:31 - 38:36)
company like what have they been doing (38:33 - 38:37)
like (38:36 - 38:40)
they would be (38:37 - 38:42)
being paid by the Pokemon company to (38:40 - 38:44)
work on this right that's how it works (38:42 - 38:46)
like company wants YouTube Here's the (38:44 - 38:48)
money make the game (38:46 - 38:50)
if this got canceled (38:48 - 38:52)
I I would hope they're making a (38:50 - 38:54)
different game then but they haven't (38:52 - 38:56)
said so it would be safe to assume that (38:54 - 38:57)
they're probably still working on this (38:56 - 39:00)
so you know interesting you bring up (38:57 - 39:01)
this Vitality sensor thing because I (39:00 - 39:02)
definitely just looked it up to be like (39:01 - 39:04)
what is this thing you're talking about (39:02 - 39:07)
and it was presented in 2009 (39:04 - 39:09)
and it was canceled in 2013 due to (39:07 - 39:12)
testing issues which would be the same (39:09 - 39:14)
time frame that sleep was initially (39:12 - 39:17)
announced and it's now 2023 four years I (39:14 - 39:22)
hope the same fate does not meet sleep (39:17 - 39:22)
[Laughter] (39:23 - 39:27)
uh we've had some uh pretty wild (39:27 - 39:33)
announcements that came out of left (39:31 - 39:35)
field (39:33 - 39:38)
um so one of them being new Pokemon Snap (39:35 - 39:40)
which (39:38 - 39:41)
was (39:40 - 39:44)
uh I think two years ago at a Pokemon (39:41 - 39:45)
presents because then it would have came (39:44 - 39:47)
out a year later (39:45 - 39:49)
uh which you know the Pokemon company (39:47 - 39:52)
multiple interviews for years say you (39:49 - 39:53)
know we have no desire to make a new (39:52 - 39:55)
Pokemon Snap and then it changed to like (39:53 - 39:58)
we have no plans we have no desire to if (39:55 - 39:59)
we did do Pokemon Snap we would have to (39:58 - 40:01)
do something very creative and very new (39:59 - 40:05)
to make it feel unique which is like (40:01 - 40:06)
just overall like a very general (40:05 - 40:08)
Nintendo statement of like we always got (40:06 - 40:09)
to do something new we can't make the (40:08 - 40:11)
same game over and over again and that (40:09 - 40:13)
was one year before that like that (40:11 - 40:15)
statement was from one year before they (40:13 - 40:18)
announced new Pokemon Snap so so we've (40:15 - 40:19)
had we've had like new Pokemon Snap (40:18 - 40:23)
appear we had a a remake of Mystery (40:19 - 40:25)
Dungeon DX that just came out of nowhere (40:23 - 40:27)
and they're like this game's coming out (40:25 - 40:28)
soon (40:27 - 40:30)
so is this the year where they're just (40:28 - 40:32)
like we're a Reviving Ranger we're (40:30 - 40:36)
Reviving Conquest we're Reviving gosh (40:32 - 40:38)
um Stadium (40:36 - 40:40)
's one of those games where they're like (40:38 - 40:41)
we got no we got no desire to make that (40:40 - 40:44)
uh (40:41 - 40:47)
but I maybe they maybe they found a (40:44 - 40:49)
unique way to do stadium that they're (40:47 - 40:52)
like we can bring it back but both uh (40:49 - 40:56)
both new snap and uh mystery dungeon (40:52 - 40:57)
that was dirt was that did those come (40:56 - 41:01)
out during their 25 year anniversary (40:57 - 41:01)
yes I know snap did because it came out (41:02 - 41:07)
uh in April of no Mystery Dungeon was a (41:05 - 41:08)
year before (41:07 - 41:11)
okay okay okay yeah (41:08 - 41:12)
um because I wouldn't say those little (41:11 - 41:14)
surprises and things like that they make (41:12 - 41:16)
a little bit more sense it being like (41:14 - 41:18)
the 25th anniversary and we all know how (41:16 - 41:20)
wonderful everybody loved the 25th (41:18 - 41:22)
anniversary of Pokemon but I mean it was (41:20 - 41:25)
like I I mean you know that that kind of (41:22 - 41:27)
stuff is like kind of makes sense little (41:25 - 41:28)
surprises like that when it's like the (41:27 - 41:32)
25th you know anniversary versus what (41:28 - 41:34)
would this be 27 years so I guess it's (41:32 - 41:37)
yeah 27th year (41:34 - 41:39)
so I could see them I could see that (41:37 - 41:41)
like not having the kinds of surprises (41:39 - 41:43)
that you had during like the 25th or the (41:41 - 41:46)
20th anniversary (41:43 - 41:46)
yeah I I feel like there has to be a (41:46 - 41:53)
a company like a like a so Bandai Namco (41:50 - 41:56)
made both pokken and (41:53 - 41:58)
snap and then (41:56 - 42:00)
gosh I can't remember the company that (41:58 - 42:01)
makes Mystery Dungeon (42:00 - 42:03)
and then I think that was a different (42:01 - 42:05)
company that made Ranger (42:03 - 42:07)
and then a different company made (42:05 - 42:09)
Conquest there's probably other third (42:07 - 42:11)
party like I don't know Pokey Park three (42:09 - 42:13)
uh I I can't remember who made Pokey (42:11 - 42:14)
Park (42:13 - 42:16)
but (42:14 - 42:18)
there could be something new there (42:16 - 42:20)
there's also the (42:18 - 42:23)
we're working on a sequel to the 3DS (42:20 - 42:26)
version of detective Pikachu that is (42:23 - 42:28)
still nowhere to be found that was (42:26 - 42:29)
announced the same time that sleep was (42:28 - 42:32)
right and people yes did not keep their (42:29 - 42:34)
like hype up on that nearly as much as (42:32 - 42:37)
they did swipe correct well I mean you (42:34 - 42:39)
kind of know what to expect there (42:37 - 42:40)
there's a difference between being (42:39 - 42:42)
excited for something that you have no (42:40 - 42:44)
idea what to expect and being excited (42:42 - 42:45)
for something that you kind of know what (42:44 - 42:47)
it'll look like (42:45 - 42:49)
yeah I (42:47 - 42:51)
as much as people absolutely loved (42:49 - 42:54)
Conquest that game did not sell well at (42:51 - 42:55)
all (42:54 - 42:58)
um and detective Pikachu kind of in the (42:55 - 43:01)
same boat of while while the movie did (42:58 - 43:02)
great and I thought the movie was (43:01 - 43:06)
fantastic the movie Loosely followed (43:02 - 43:07)
that game (43:06 - 43:09)
and (43:07 - 43:11)
uh the game was very cute and very (43:09 - 43:13)
Charming but very understandable why (43:11 - 43:16)
people didn't pick it up (43:13 - 43:20)
um it wasn't like the world's a slight (43:16 - 43:21)
spoiler for the end of the detective (43:20 - 43:23)
Pikachu game uh they don't have an (43:21 - 43:25)
ending to that game it doesn't actually (43:23 - 43:29)
end uh like you you get to a point where (43:25 - 43:32)
like okay I think I have solved the (43:29 - 43:35)
entire mystery give me the reveal to see (43:32 - 43:37)
if I was right and they were like we (43:35 - 43:39)
could give you the reveal but what if we (43:37 - 43:41)
told you we need you to do something (43:39 - 43:45)
else and that something else is not in (43:41 - 43:46)
this game because here are your credits (43:45 - 43:49)
and you're like (43:46 - 43:52)
oh okay (43:49 - 43:52)
like I I I guess I mean I definitely (43:53 - 43:58)
enjoyed my time with the detective (43:56 - 44:00)
Pikachu game (43:58 - 44:00)
uh I mean like I don't see a problem (44:01 - 44:05)
with that kind of ending if a second (44:03 - 44:07)
game is actually yeah as long as you (44:05 - 44:10)
have something coming up for sure (44:07 - 44:13)
but you can't do a cliffhanger and then (44:10 - 44:14)
never have the next thing I mean you can (44:13 - 44:17)
but it's frustrating and it's that's sad (44:14 - 44:19)
yeah it makes you dislike the first (44:17 - 44:21)
thing yeah and I think they're in such a (44:19 - 44:23)
weird spot with Detective Pikachu (44:21 - 44:25)
because like (44:23 - 44:28)
is the is the the supposedly the switch (44:25 - 44:31)
version going to recap what happened in (44:28 - 44:33)
the first game or is it gonna be most of (44:31 - 44:36)
the first game streamlined into like (44:33 - 44:37)
giving us an ending is it an actual (44:36 - 44:39)
sequel where you pick up because if the (44:37 - 44:40)
first game didn't sell well and you need (44:39 - 44:42)
to play the first game (44:40 - 44:45)
like that's gonna sell even less or are (44:42 - 44:46)
people gonna look at that and be like oh (44:45 - 44:48)
I love the movie let me buy the game and (44:46 - 44:50)
then realize oh these are not like it (44:48 - 44:52)
just feels like there's a huge marketing (44:50 - 44:54)
issue with trying to put out a detective (44:52 - 44:56)
Pikachu game that isn't like how do we (44:54 - 44:58)
Market this to sell as many copies that (44:56 - 44:59)
isn't (44:58 - 45:01)
like well not a lot of people played the (44:59 - 45:02)
first one we left it with a cliffhanger (45:01 - 45:04)
a lot of people saw the movie but that (45:02 - 45:07)
was different and the first one was on a (45:04 - 45:09)
completely different console yeah they (45:07 - 45:12)
could they could base the second one off (45:09 - 45:15)
of they could mix the movie and the game (45:12 - 45:17)
together a little bit and so and then (45:15 - 45:19)
like kind of make it more off the movie (45:17 - 45:20)
potentially or something like that to (45:19 - 45:23)
where it I mean a lot more people saw (45:20 - 45:24)
the movie than played the game right so (45:23 - 45:26)
if you're gonna sell something that's a (45:24 - 45:27)
sequel like what are you gonna base that (45:26 - 45:29)
off of the thing that people that no one (45:27 - 45:30)
played or the thing that everyone saw I (45:29 - 45:32)
like but do you base It Off the movie (45:30 - 45:35)
that was what like four years ago now I (45:32 - 45:36)
don't know I don't know what their plan (45:35 - 45:39)
is here I feel like that ship has sailed (45:36 - 45:42)
yeah yeah it's just (45:39 - 45:44)
to be fair I mean covet probably threw a (45:42 - 45:45)
wrench and a lot of stuff for a lot of (45:44 - 45:47)
companies um (45:45 - 45:50)
I (45:47 - 45:50)
I could see them I could see them (45:51 - 45:55)
talking about the anime and being like (45:53 - 45:57)
okay you know we signed a deal with (45:55 - 45:58)
Netflix the brand new anime is gonna (45:57 - 46:00)
start in (45:58 - 46:03)
when do anime start September normally I (46:00 - 46:04)
guess because technically you line that (46:03 - 46:06)
up with a school year (46:04 - 46:11)
no idea no clue uh there hasn't been a (46:06 - 46:12)
Pokemon movie since (46:11 - 46:14)
the zarude movie (46:12 - 46:17)
and there is always normally been as a (46:14 - 46:19)
rude movie everything there's been a (46:17 - 46:21)
rude movie for 26 years (46:19 - 46:23)
it's been in front of our eyes the (46:21 - 46:25)
entire time there there hasn't been (46:23 - 46:27)
Boy The Twist and that's a rude movie (46:25 - 46:29)
really gets you (46:27 - 46:30)
[Music] (46:29 - 46:32)
it all comes back to zurud from the (46:30 - 46:34)
beginning there has normally been a (46:32 - 46:36)
Pokemon movie every year and then (46:34 - 46:38)
obviously kovid messed up this rude (46:36 - 46:40)
movie this rude movie eventually came (46:38 - 46:42)
out there has not been a movie since (46:40 - 46:45)
I think it's very plausible for them to (46:42 - 46:47)
announce a movie I think is also very (46:45 - 46:51)
possible for that movie to include Ash (46:47 - 46:51)
I'm not so sure (46:52 - 46:55)
I feel like once they're done with Ash (46:55 - 46:59)
they're done with Ash (46:56 - 47:01)
I could be wrong (46:59 - 47:06)
but we we just don't know yet yeah (47:01 - 47:06)
pull up like (47:06 - 47:10)
I know that like they're they're moving (47:07 - 47:12)
on but uh it wouldn't make a whole lot (47:10 - 47:14)
of sense for the kids who are watching (47:12 - 47:15)
the current anime to go and see a movie (47:14 - 47:18)
with a character they don't know (47:15 - 47:22)
I worked for detective Pikachu (47:18 - 47:22)
yeah (47:22 - 47:25)
[Laughter] (47:23 - 47:29)
true uh no argument there (47:25 - 47:33)
but I mean take take a look at um uh the (47:29 - 47:36)
one that came out in 2017 or I choose (47:33 - 47:38)
you so it was like kind of re-ashing (47:36 - 47:40)
well you know but that was different (47:38 - 47:42)
right so if you're watching the anime at (47:40 - 47:45)
that time that was sun and moon and then (47:42 - 47:47)
you've got all these characters that (47:45 - 47:49)
were in that movie that weren't part of (47:47 - 47:51)
the anime yeah no there's always Side (47:49 - 47:53)
characters but when the main character (47:51 - 47:55)
is the thing tying it together (47:53 - 47:58)
yeah here's what they do technically I (47:55 - 48:01)
Choose You they is is (47:58 - 48:04)
the beginning of Pokemon right uh they (48:01 - 48:06)
remade the Mewtwo movie in that weird (48:04 - 48:10)
clay CG yeah that's right the power of (48:06 - 48:13)
us is a play on The Power of One (48:10 - 48:16)
so now the third then the next one is (48:13 - 48:19)
gonna be an Entei movie but instead of (48:16 - 48:22)
anti falling in love with Ash's mom he (48:19 - 48:24)
falls in love with Mr mime and then they (48:22 - 48:27)
retell that story wait does it no (48:24 - 48:28)
doesn't that entertain movie isn't it (48:27 - 48:29)
something what's the name of it (48:28 - 48:31)
something unknown (48:29 - 48:35)
and it takes place in Hisui perfect it's (48:31 - 48:37)
perfect (48:35 - 48:40)
we've got it (48:37 - 48:40)
I don't think the Entei actually loved (48:41 - 48:46)
Ash's mom I think the little girl just (48:43 - 48:47)
thought that that was her mother right (48:46 - 48:50)
like Dante was the dad yeah and then (48:47 - 48:52)
Ash's mom was her mom (48:50 - 48:54)
but the Entei wasn't even a real Entei (48:52 - 48:56)
it was created by the unknown (48:54 - 48:59)
but but Mr mind's love that's definitely (48:56 - 49:03)
true but Mrs mom the case closed (48:59 - 49:06)
laughs (49:03 - 49:06)
I would assume there would be a Pokemon (49:06 - 49:11)
go update I would assume that I think I (49:08 - 49:13)
think that's probably safe that like (49:11 - 49:15)
something like what did they do well (49:13 - 49:17)
when they announce sleep uh four years (49:15 - 49:19)
ago (49:17 - 49:21)
they also were like there's a bunch of (49:19 - 49:23)
Snorlax spawning in Pokemon go that was (49:21 - 49:26)
great so I think there will probably be (49:23 - 49:28)
something it would be foolish of them or (49:26 - 49:29)
or kind of silly if they don't bring up (49:28 - 49:31)
Pokemon go it's obviously a very big (49:29 - 49:34)
part of the Pokemon franchise so they (49:31 - 49:36)
bring up Pokemon go something happens in (49:34 - 49:38)
Pokemon go or some event is coming that (49:36 - 49:40)
they talk about uh I think all the (49:38 - 49:43)
rumors are pointing towards zashian (49:40 - 49:46)
being a free Pokemon in Pokemon unite (49:43 - 49:49)
for that weekend (49:46 - 49:51)
um so I think that's maybe safe to say (49:49 - 49:53)
uh you know finally sword and Shield's (49:51 - 49:55)
gonna get the complete national decks (49:53 - 49:56)
I'm sure they're gonna announce that no (49:55 - 49:59)
I'm just kidding that was it laughs (49:56 - 50:02)
don't even oh I've been waiting for (49:59 - 50:04)
years I was told that there would be a (50:02 - 50:05)
third sword and shield DLC they would (50:04 - 50:08)
finally add all the Pokemon (50:05 - 50:09)
where were the YouTubers that's what (50:08 - 50:12)
they told me for years (50:09 - 50:12)
they were they were right about that (50:14 - 50:17)
they gotta be right about going back to (50:15 - 50:21)
Kalos for the Scarlet Violet DLC (50:17 - 50:21)
answering these questions in paldeo just (50:21 - 50:26)
send me back to callous (50:23 - 50:26)
yeah so uh so what we got Anime (50:28 - 50:35)
unite Pokemon go anime maybe not so much (50:31 - 50:36)
but (50:35 - 50:38)
if if they're made they're making a big (50:36 - 50:39)
deal about this new anime it kind of (50:38 - 50:41)
would make sense to bring it up on I (50:39 - 50:44)
don't know go is right off the heels of (50:41 - 50:46)
like of the Hoenn tour like the global (50:44 - 50:47)
hoe and tour it's like literally the (50:46 - 50:50)
next day so (50:47 - 50:51)
I don't know that they would do anything (50:50 - 50:53)
immediately and go but they might they (50:51 - 50:54)
could announce something for something (50:53 - 50:57)
down the line a little bit well we don't (50:54 - 50:59)
have like (50:57 - 51:01)
there's right now we're in the (50:59 - 51:03)
Valentine's Day event and then after the (51:01 - 51:05)
Valentine's Day event is the Rayquaza (51:03 - 51:08)
whatever the Hoenn lead up event the (51:05 - 51:11)
starters and Rayquaza whatever right (51:08 - 51:12)
yeah yeah (51:11 - 51:14)
so we have nothing after that for that (51:12 - 51:17)
week and if go events normally start on (51:14 - 51:19)
Tuesdays and then they go till Sunday (51:17 - 51:22)
that's true I would assume that I don't (51:19 - 51:24)
know knowing knowing the performance the (51:22 - 51:26)
first big go non-community Day event (51:24 - 51:28)
that we have coming up is going to be on (51:26 - 51:29)
March 5th (51:28 - 51:32)
right okay so that's just the next (51:29 - 51:34)
weekend right that's the weekend after (51:32 - 51:37)
so classic Pokemon company they'll be (51:34 - 51:39)
like revisit Kanto you'll find (51:37 - 51:42)
Charmander Bulbasaur and Squirtle in the (51:39 - 51:44)
wild if you're lucky trainers we're (51:42 - 51:49)
putting YouTube back into right (51:44 - 51:54)
they could finally move the birds from (51:49 - 51:57)
the incense into raids (51:54 - 52:00)
um and have like a raid day for that I (51:57 - 52:01)
can find something else in the incense (52:00 - 52:03)
hopefully and put something else in the (52:01 - 52:05)
incense yeah finally got Articuno (52:03 - 52:07)
congratulations I had a Zapdos shake (52:05 - 52:10)
twice and run away (52:07 - 52:13)
by my history with the 15 minute incense (52:10 - 52:14)
is I go okay nothing is going to (52:13 - 52:17)
distract me I turn it on I get (52:14 - 52:19)
distracted all of a sudden 15 minutes (52:17 - 52:20)
are up and it's like you've caught two (52:19 - 52:24)
Pokemon great perfect I forgot I turned (52:20 - 52:29)
this on uh it was useless dang well so I (52:24 - 52:31)
wish I wish there was a feature in (52:29 - 52:34)
Pokemon go to be like uh the incense is (52:31 - 52:35)
on (52:34 - 52:36)
don't (52:35 - 52:41)
despawn All Team Rocket uh despawn the (52:36 - 52:43)
ability to send me raid invites Focus (52:41 - 52:46)
mode Focus mode (52:43 - 52:49)
because I clearly have no self-control (52:46 - 52:52)
to do the 15-minute incense without (52:49 - 52:55)
being distracted yeah (52:52 - 52:58)
that's just no I don't know I have to (52:55 - 53:01)
fix it fix my problem I double I've got (52:58 - 53:03)
the double incense time right now so (53:01 - 53:05)
it's 30 minutes right now because I did (53:03 - 53:08)
that branch of the mountain XP and the (53:05 - 53:10)
Articuno I caught was in minute like 20 (53:08 - 53:12)
or 21 so I was like had I not doubled (53:10 - 53:14)
the incense time and you're not the only (53:12 - 53:16)
person in our slack who's gotten one (53:14 - 53:19)
on this event because of that one sense (53:16 - 53:22)
yes it was like the same day actually (53:19 - 53:24)
um that we caught ours so (53:22 - 53:26)
yeah (53:24 - 53:26)
any other predictions we have (53:27 - 53:30)
there's going to be a plushie on a shelf (53:31 - 53:35)
that makes somebody think some remake is (53:33 - 53:38)
coming (53:35 - 53:38)
on a shelf and people are going to be (53:38 - 53:44)
like Gen 5 remake coming soon we did we (53:40 - 53:46)
didn't talk about this last week (53:44 - 53:48)
um because I didn't think it was really (53:46 - 53:50)
that newsworthy but there they added (53:48 - 53:52)
Pokemon Trading Card Game to the Virtual (53:50 - 53:54)
Console the Game Boy Virtual Console (53:52 - 53:56)
that's coming to switch (53:54 - 53:57)
um (53:56 - 54:01)
that look it was also on the 3DS it (53:57 - 54:05)
didn't like it existed for 23 years or (54:01 - 54:07)
whatever (54:05 - 54:09)
um it's it's a fine game nothing wrong (54:07 - 54:11)
with it I don't I don't think anyone's (54:09 - 54:14)
signing up for the Game Boy Player to (54:11 - 54:15)
play specifically that game maybe (54:14 - 54:17)
somebody is maybe one person is (54:15 - 54:18)
um (54:17 - 54:21)
do we think they're gonna add (54:18 - 54:24)
any of the older Pokemon games because (54:21 - 54:28)
of Pokemon day two virtual console is (54:24 - 54:30)
that what they're even calling it is it (54:28 - 54:32)
even called virtual console (54:30 - 54:35)
Game Boy Player I don't even know I (54:32 - 54:37)
don't know either (54:35 - 54:39)
there aren't Pokemon games there right (54:37 - 54:41)
now so I haven't or whatever yeah I (54:39 - 54:44)
don't know I think that eventually Ruby (54:41 - 54:46)
and Sapphire will probably come there (54:44 - 54:48)
and hopefully emerald too but I don't (54:46 - 54:52)
know if it's gonna be now (54:48 - 54:52)
I can see them saying later this summer (54:52 - 54:57)
it will come (54:55 - 54:59)
um I don't I don't know if I could see (54:57 - 55:01)
them doing a shadow drop of like after (54:59 - 55:04)
today's presentation uh gold and silver (55:01 - 55:08)
are in the eShop (55:04 - 55:08)
um (55:08 - 55:10)
it would they would have to have home (55:10 - 55:15)
compatibility right (55:12 - 55:16)
I mean I remember on this podcast (55:15 - 55:19)
arguing with gosh I don't even remember (55:16 - 55:21)
who was on that episode but it was you (55:19 - 55:23)
know whether or not (55:21 - 55:25)
red blue and yellow would have Bank (55:23 - 55:28)
compatibility and I was like they have (55:25 - 55:30)
to like that's the thing they keep (55:28 - 55:31)
saying publicly is like we don't ever (55:30 - 55:34)
want to have a gold to Silver to Ruby (55:31 - 55:38)
Sapphire issue again but would they do (55:34 - 55:40)
that if it's a part of the subscription (55:38 - 55:43)
because you lose the subscription you've (55:40 - 55:45)
now taken Pokemon over there or it's (55:43 - 55:47)
like you don't own the game in the same (55:45 - 55:50)
way that you do with the Ruby I mean (55:47 - 55:52)
with the red blue yellow like those are (55:50 - 55:53)
just eShop you downloaded them for 10 (55:52 - 55:56)
bucks 3DS you know and they're yours (55:53 - 55:59)
this wouldn't be that so (55:56 - 56:00)
it would be kind of weird if there was (55:59 - 56:02)
home compatibility although I don't (56:00 - 56:03)
think I don't think they could put them (56:02 - 56:05)
out without home compatibility (56:03 - 56:08)
well then that makes me wonder like (56:05 - 56:11)
is it I don't think it's more than that (56:08 - 56:14)
but I just it's a subscription so how do (56:11 - 56:16)
you or maybe they don't care like you (56:14 - 56:17)
move them into home and then you stop (56:16 - 56:19)
paying and it's like okay well you get (56:17 - 56:22)
to keep this Pokemon are yours like (56:19 - 56:25)
I don't know if you know I I don't know (56:22 - 56:28)
yeah I there there has not been a single (56:25 - 56:30)
old game that they've put on that (56:28 - 56:33)
service that I was like I would love to (56:30 - 56:35)
play this there's just like (56:33 - 56:38)
I I know people have a lot of nostalgia (56:35 - 56:41)
but like I played (56:38 - 56:44)
so much golden eye as a kid I just I I (56:41 - 56:46)
don't need to go back (56:44 - 56:48)
I watch somebody play GoldenEye recently (56:46 - 56:50)
on Twitch they were like let's check out (56:48 - 56:51)
GoldenEye and they went through that (56:50 - 56:53)
first level and I was like (56:51 - 56:55)
I remember this perfectly I have no (56:53 - 56:57)
desire to play this again now I'm I'm (56:55 - 57:01)
obviously some people probably do uh but (56:57 - 57:03)
like I I do not want to give Nintendo (57:01 - 57:06)
another was it 25 a year to upgrade for (57:03 - 57:08)
Nintendo 64 games or Game Boy advanced (57:06 - 57:13)
games to play like Metroid Fusion I I (57:08 - 57:15)
played it I played it from start to (57:13 - 57:16)
finish I like don't need to play it (57:15 - 57:18)
again well to counter that I'm the (57:16 - 57:21)
person who I saw Echo the dolphin was on (57:18 - 57:23)
the expansion version and was like I (57:21 - 57:25)
gotta do this and I'm on a family (57:23 - 57:26)
playing with some people so I was like I (57:25 - 57:28)
hit up the people I'm like we're getting (57:26 - 57:30)
the expanded version of the online stuff (57:28 - 57:32)
because I got to play Echo the dolphin (57:30 - 57:33)
and they were all like yeah yeah that's (57:32 - 57:35)
fine like let's do it and then I played (57:33 - 57:39)
it a total of one time and it was great (57:35 - 57:40)
but then like Scarlett Violet came out (57:39 - 57:42)
and I was like is it worth it was it (57:40 - 57:43)
worth the upgrade for the one time Echo (57:42 - 57:45)
I'm gonna go back and play it again I'm (57:43 - 57:47)
gonna play today but now that I say it (57:45 - 57:48)
now that I say it and I just remembered (57:47 - 57:50)
that it's there again I'm gonna play it (57:48 - 57:51)
today (57:50 - 57:54)
wonderful game uh 10 out of 10. there's (57:51 - 57:56)
no denying that Pokemon games would push (57:54 - 57:59)
people towards that service (57:56 - 58:00)
um (57:59 - 58:02)
and I think (58:00 - 58:04)
for there there's like two sides of me (58:02 - 58:06)
there's the side that like archiving (58:04 - 58:10)
having a way to play old games is (58:06 - 58:12)
and having those archived in a way where (58:10 - 58:15)
you don't have to walk into a ma and Paw (58:12 - 58:17)
shop and spend 200 on heart gold soul (58:15 - 58:19)
silver no one wants to do that I don't (58:17 - 58:21)
think anyone should do that uh I think (58:19 - 58:24)
that those games should be available on (58:21 - 58:26)
a store that you can purchase for 40 (58:24 - 58:28)
bucks or I think 40 bucks is too much (58:26 - 58:30)
but they did beat 40 bucks I don't but I (58:28 - 58:32)
don't think anyone should be walking in (58:30 - 58:34)
being like yep 200 for (58:32 - 58:38)
this software that could easily be (58:34 - 58:41)
on on an eShop or something so for an (58:38 - 58:43)
archival purpose and for them just (58:41 - 58:45)
existing and them being accessible I (58:43 - 58:47)
think 100 they should exist (58:45 - 58:52)
uh in like do they hold up situation (58:47 - 58:54)
if you are one of those people that are (58:52 - 58:57)
complaining that Urban mystica drops are (58:54 - 58:59)
too hard to find or too rare they're (58:57 - 59:02)
first off they're 11 in any five-star (58:59 - 59:06)
raid they are 13 in a six star raid if (59:02 - 59:09)
that is too low of a percentage there is (59:06 - 59:11)
nothing about ruby and sapphire that (59:09 - 59:13)
you're going to enjoy because that game (59:11 - 59:17)
will exhaust every amount of second from (59:13 - 59:20)
you to give you nothing in return the (59:17 - 59:23)
older Pokemon games are so (59:20 - 59:26)
like stingy in like your time versus (59:23 - 59:28)
your reward (59:26 - 59:31)
uh investment like they're just on top (59:28 - 59:33)
of just being broken like should Ruby (59:31 - 59:35)
and Sapphire be there yes should you (59:33 - 59:37)
give Nintendo an extra 25 a month to (59:35 - 59:40)
play them no If eventually when they add (59:37 - 59:43)
Emerald should you play that instead yes (59:40 - 59:45)
like (59:43 - 59:45)
like it's even like the same extent of (59:46 - 59:49)
like (59:48 - 59:53)
Diamond and Pearl are by far some of the (59:49 - 59:55)
worst video games ever (59:53 - 59:58)
because Platinum exists like there there (59:55 - 60:02)
there's just like no reason to ever (59:58 - 60:05)
choose those two games over Platinum (60:02 - 60:08)
like you get a better story The the HP (60:05 - 60:10)
bars move faster there's less glitches (60:08 - 60:12)
they've added more Pokemon more like (60:10 - 60:14)
content it's just so many quality of (60:12 - 60:16)
life updates (60:14 - 60:18)
like like a a thing that I think people (60:16 - 60:20)
don't even remember at all about ruby (60:18 - 60:23)
and sapphire is one it has a very (60:20 - 60:25)
limited Pokedex that is because we went (60:23 - 60:27)
from zero compatibility they cut off (60:25 - 60:29)
everything all five six games prior red (60:27 - 60:32)
blue yellow gold silver Crystal all of (60:29 - 60:33)
those were cut (60:32 - 60:36)
um so if you wanted a complete Pokedex (60:33 - 60:38)
in (60:36 - 60:40)
Ruby and Sapphire you needed Coliseum (60:38 - 60:42)
you needed Gale Darkness you needed fire (60:40 - 60:44)
red and leaf green I want to remind (60:42 - 60:46)
people because I know there are people (60:44 - 60:48)
being like I love Ruby and Sapphire if (60:46 - 60:49)
maybe you didn't play it maybe maybe you (60:48 - 60:51)
don't remember it let me remind people (60:49 - 60:54)
there is no Ditto in Ruby and Sapphire (60:51 - 60:58)
at all not in the wild not anywhere (60:54 - 60:59)
now I know there's no Masuda Method in (60:58 - 61:02)
Ruby and Sapphire but if you want to (60:59 - 61:05)
breed there's no ditto at all you would (61:02 - 61:07)
have had to either purchase Emerald or (61:05 - 61:09)
rubience or or Fire Red Leaf Green to (61:07 - 61:14)
move ditto over into that game like like (61:09 - 61:16)
I think sometimes with these older (61:14 - 61:19)
Pokemon games people have such thick (61:16 - 61:22)
Nostalgia glasses and (61:19 - 61:24)
it for me it's hard to go back to them (61:22 - 61:26)
now I am going through Ruby and Sapphire (61:24 - 61:27)
because I'm doing a ribbon Quest and all (61:26 - 61:29)
of these issues are very apparent to me (61:27 - 61:32)
but also I cannot do that on a virtual (61:29 - 61:34)
console I have to continue playing it on (61:32 - 61:35)
actual Hardware to move them forward (61:34 - 61:36)
[Music] (61:35 - 61:39)
so like even if they were that's just my (61:36 - 61:41)
a me problem like I I ain't touching (61:39 - 61:43)
Ruby and Sapphire again I already got a (61:41 - 61:45)
copy started I got like three shinies in (61:43 - 61:46)
it these Pokemon are already like going (61:45 - 61:48)
through their ribbon Quest and they're (61:46 - 61:50)
I'm suffering with them and once once (61:48 - 61:53)
we're done we will move to we'll move to (61:50 - 61:54)
platinum and we will get those ribbons (61:53 - 61:56)
and we will suffer less every game we (61:54 - 62:00)
move up we suffer less and less (61:56 - 62:00)
I I don't even know what to say that I (62:03 - 62:08)
will say like I am the person with the (62:06 - 62:09)
Nostalgia glasses right like I bought (62:08 - 62:10)
like (62:09 - 62:13)
silver and Crystal actually when they (62:10 - 62:15)
were on the Virtual Console in the 3DS (62:13 - 62:18)
you know and I was like oh man silver (62:15 - 62:20)
it's been so long can't wait to play it (62:18 - 62:22)
again and I got like 15 minutes into (62:20 - 62:25)
that and I was like oh yeah like this (62:22 - 62:27)
isn't this isn't as good like this I (62:25 - 62:29)
mean it's just you know it's like I (62:27 - 62:31)
loved I loved it when I was 11 12 13 (62:29 - 62:34)
years old but and now like sun and moon (62:31 - 62:35)
is out and I love this right and it's (62:34 - 62:38)
different yeah but you know I am that (62:35 - 62:39)
person I'm the person that goes back and (62:38 - 62:41)
again to Echo the dolphin 10 out of 10 (62:39 - 62:44)
games right like I'm playing it today I (62:41 - 62:48)
told you I can find a deal of approval (62:44 - 62:50)
I could see an argument for people who (62:48 - 62:51)
have never played the games before and (62:50 - 62:54)
want to experience the story and the (62:51 - 62:55)
games for the first time I think that (62:54 - 62:58)
maybe playing post-game content trying (62:55 - 63:01)
to shiny hunt any kind of that kind of (62:58 - 63:04)
thing is not the best experience in (63:01 - 63:06)
those games but I will say that I have (63:04 - 63:08)
more than one friend who's happy to get (63:06 - 63:10)
to go and experience those games for the (63:08 - 63:12)
first time and as someone who's who's (63:10 - 63:14)
home game I was I was a Ruby Sapphire (63:12 - 63:18)
kid is that generation I'm not gonna (63:14 - 63:21)
stop them from going and experiencing my (63:18 - 63:22)
favorite region (63:21 - 63:25)
I love Owen (63:22 - 63:28)
yeah I I I I think there is there is a (63:25 - 63:30)
charm to go back to a game you grew up (63:28 - 63:31)
with (63:30 - 63:33)
um (63:31 - 63:33)
and I again I do think they should be (63:33 - 63:38)
there uh I I don't think they're there (63:35 - 63:40)
for everyone I I do think in a marketing (63:38 - 63:43)
aspect of you know somebody who maybe (63:40 - 63:45)
didn't pull the trigger on scarlet and (63:43 - 63:47)
violet they they see that Ruby and (63:45 - 63:50)
Sapphire or Crystal or something is in (63:47 - 63:52)
the eShop they download it they play it (63:50 - 63:54)
they have a great time and then they (63:52 - 63:55)
start looking into new Pokemon games (63:54 - 63:57)
like that is that is a real scenario (63:55 - 63:58)
that exists (63:57 - 64:00)
um so for marketing purposes like I (63:58 - 64:02)
think I think that also makes sense I (64:00 - 64:04)
think it makes I I guess like I just (64:02 - 64:05)
think it makes sense for them to be (64:04 - 64:08)
there but I don't think that (64:05 - 64:10)
um (64:08 - 64:10)
not everybody's going to want to play (64:10 - 64:14)
them right like I don't think it's like (64:12 - 64:16)
this big like shake-up that like oh they (64:14 - 64:18)
need to be there like they need to be (64:16 - 64:19)
there for like an archival purpose and (64:18 - 64:20)
like yeah (64:19 - 64:22)
um and to you know give somebody an (64:20 - 64:24)
affordable way to like get these games (64:22 - 64:27)
if they want these games but like (64:24 - 64:29)
I don't know I I think more players than (64:27 - 64:31)
not are uh cannot go back to something (64:29 - 64:33)
so (64:31 - 64:35)
outdated let's say broken because we're (64:33 - 64:38)
playing it right now (64:35 - 64:40)
a common theme between these Pokemon (64:38 - 64:41)
games they're all broken in different (64:40 - 64:43)
ways (64:41 - 64:44)
um no but it goes back to just (64:43 - 64:46)
satisfying different groups of people (64:44 - 64:48)
right I mean it's okay that like maybe (64:46 - 64:50)
it won't be the most popular thing to go (64:48 - 64:52)
play uh red blue yellow or Ruby and (64:50 - 64:54)
Sapphire or whatever again (64:52 - 64:56)
um but if you can open that up to (64:54 - 64:57)
getting more people (64:56 - 64:59)
playing Pokemon I think that's a good (64:57 - 65:01)
thing and I think the Pokemon company (64:59 - 65:03)
definitely thinks that's a good thing so (65:01 - 65:05)
you know they like to sell copies that's (65:03 - 65:07)
for sure (65:05 - 65:07)
uh well all right (65:07 - 65:10)
um (65:09 - 65:12)
that's our episode gave you guys a solid (65:10 - 65:15)
hour of predictions I'm sure 90 of this (65:12 - 65:17)
will be wrong uh I can guarantee that (65:15 - 65:18)
they will mention the word Pokemon (65:17 - 65:21)
during a Pokemon Day presentation I I (65:18 - 65:23)
guess if they have one I'm assuming (65:21 - 65:25)
there will be some sort of presents (65:23 - 65:27)
um who knows if that's going to be six (65:25 - 65:30)
minutes or 15 minutes or 25 minutes (65:27 - 65:33)
don't know (65:30 - 65:33)
um anyways uh thanks for making to the (65:34 - 65:38)
end uh you can give us your Pokemon day (65:36 - 65:39)
predictions in the comments below if (65:38 - 65:41)
you're watching on YouTube (65:39 - 65:43)
um if you're listening on Apple podcast (65:41 - 65:45)
or Spotify and (65:43 - 65:47)
you can't leave a comment but you can (65:45 - 65:49)
review us that is helpful too if you're (65:47 - 65:50)
listening on those uh thank you Hannah (65:49 - 65:53)
for being here thank you Bobby (65:50 - 65:54)
um it's gonna be really weird because (65:53 - 65:56)
our next episode is going to come out on (65:54 - 65:59)
Pokemon day so we might just naturally (65:56 - 66:00)
do a shorter episode and then maybe do (65:59 - 66:03)
like a bonus episode that comes out that (66:00 - 66:06)
evening with just like thoughts (66:03 - 66:07)
um (66:06 - 66:10)
so uh if you're listening to the podcast (66:07 - 66:15)
feeds uh and the 27th episode is the (66:10 - 66:16)
episode that comes out the 27th is (66:15 - 66:18)
probably short (66:16 - 66:19)
