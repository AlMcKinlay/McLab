catch it or enjoy it there yes I should (0:55 - 1:02)
apologize in advance of the audios if (1:00 - 1:06)
the audio sounds differently we had to (1:02 - 1:08)
install some new audio software to make (1:06 - 1:10)
it work with twitch last week and I just (1:08 - 1:11)
ran some updates on the current audio (1:10 - 1:14)
software so it sounds a little weird to (1:11 - 1:15)
me but in my test recordings that (1:14 - 1:17)
sounded normal so what I'm we'll just (1:15 - 1:19)
find out and I'll futz with it for next (1:17 - 1:22)
week we're just doing a smaller episode (1:19 - 1:24)
for you guys just make sure you get your (1:22 - 1:28)
fourth episode for January and yeah we (1:24 - 1:30)
are not launching our 3rd century here (1:28 - 1:34)
okay we we had a lot of fun like I think (1:30 - 1:35)
we had fun last week very well you have (1:34 - 1:38)
fun I mean depends on how you define fun (1:35 - 1:41)
it was a diversion sitting in front of a (1:38 - 1:45)
camera for two hours yeah having people (1:41 - 1:47)
comment about how old i am now you only (1:45 - 1:50)
have like two people say that and there (1:47 - 1:52)
was before is it you one hundred percent (1:50 - 1:55)
more than you just said that's okay (1:52 - 2:00)
alright um we have like what about 60 to (1:55 - 2:03)
80 people fluctuate in and out I wanted (2:00 - 2:06)
to get my con but he's busy with work (2:03 - 2:09)
but he was moderating the chat and doing (2:06 - 2:12)
a very good job of it but anyway that we (2:09 - 2:14)
had a nice turnout for our first time on (2:12 - 2:16)
twitch and I think it's something we (2:14 - 2:18)
want to do again it's something the (2:16 - 2:21)
people in the twitch chat wanted to do (2:18 - 2:22)
again and I know a lot of people I did a (2:21 - 2:25)
poll afterwards of how many enjoyed the (2:22 - 2:26)
show and how many missed it and it was (2:25 - 2:27)
like 75 percent of people said they (2:26 - 2:30)
couldn't actually make the show so (2:27 - 2:32)
obviously there's a lot more people that (2:30 - 2:34)
could have been watching if (2:32 - 2:35)
if we were to do it in the future (2:34 - 2:38)
obviously different times some players a (2:35 - 2:40)
horrible rumor going around that if the (2:38 - 2:42)
patreon makes more money that we have to (2:40 - 2:44)
do a weekly stream or something like (2:42 - 2:49)
that yeah horrifying yeah so let's just (2:44 - 2:51)
get the patreon stuff out of the way if (2:49 - 2:53)
you obviously if you're new listener I (2:51 - 2:54)
ignore this but if you're not if you're (2:53 - 2:56)
an older well I have your new listener (2:54 - 2:58)
you can you can keep listening but we do (2:56 - 3:01)
a patreon over at patreon.com / it's (2:58 - 3:04)
super effective and if you care to throw (3:01 - 3:05)
a dollar a month our way you get access (3:04 - 3:08)
to our slack community and if you give (3:05 - 3:11)
us four dollars a month which is one (3:08 - 3:13)
dollar per episode you get access to our (3:11 - 3:18)
gold channel which bar beagle channel so (3:13 - 3:22)
good it's going skull so four dollars a (3:18 - 3:24)
month gets you access to the gold (3:22 - 3:26)
exclusive channel and slack which is its (3:24 - 3:29)
it's been fun it's a smaller it's like I (3:26 - 3:33)
think only like 18 or 20 people it's a (3:29 - 3:34)
lot smaller than the main channels which (3:33 - 3:36)
is over a hundred people at this point (3:34 - 3:38)
but yeah that enables you to make fun of (3:36 - 3:40)
the people in the other channels no no (3:38 - 3:43)
that doesn't happen just well you don't (3:40 - 3:46)
know though cuz you're not gold well the (3:43 - 3:48)
listener maybe not be go we're both (3:46 - 3:52)
Gould obvious obviously um I remember (3:48 - 3:55)
yeah a little side story we I installed (3:52 - 3:59)
this cat facts pot so every 24 hours it (3:55 - 4:01)
would deliver I fact about cats (3:59 - 4:03)
automatically into the slice channel and (4:01 - 4:07)
if you hit it you could you could bring (4:03 - 4:10)
it up your sub by hitting / cat facts (4:07 - 4:12)
and it would provide you a cat fact if (4:10 - 4:16)
you needed in that moment and it was (4:12 - 4:17)
probably only active for a day or two (4:16 - 4:20)
but um I was like well I don't have any (4:17 - 4:22)
this was right one gold the gold channel (4:20 - 4:24)
first got created I was like I don't (4:22 - 4:25)
have any benefits and no one's really (4:24 - 4:28)
using cat facts so i'm going to move cat (4:25 - 4:30)
facts into the gold channel as a gold (4:28 - 4:33)
member benefit and boy the slack (4:30 - 4:36)
community really Rida dat that people (4:33 - 4:38)
have to have their their dubious cat (4:36 - 4:41)
facts that's right well it is a gold (4:38 - 4:44)
perk or cult members had facts there (4:41 - 4:47)
well how was your weekend before we (4:44 - 4:53)
uh 1 2 3 4 5 about 7 news articles to (4:47 - 4:55)
run down but before we poke my news (4:53 - 4:56)
articles but before we do that we'll (4:55 - 4:58)
how's your weekend yeah why would we (4:56 - 5:00)
talk about Pokemon we can not allowed to (4:58 - 5:02)
we're obligated by the pokemon company (5:00 - 5:04)
not to talk about pokemon for the first (5:02 - 5:06)
10 minutes so what's the rundown of the (5:04 - 5:09)
weekend we had iron banner the IB arm (5:06 - 5:12)
iron banner to get through I'd watch a (5:09 - 5:14)
lot of new heart which I enjoy watching (5:12 - 5:18)
that old sitcom gem from the 80s and (5:14 - 5:23)
finished a crochet project and then last (5:18 - 5:25)
night you and I played playstation (5:23 - 5:28)
together where we basically didn't talk (5:25 - 5:29)
to each other and played two completely (5:28 - 5:31)
different games but we were connected (5:29 - 5:33)
through the headset I think you and I (5:31 - 5:35)
did that for about three or four hours (5:33 - 5:39)
yep said about five words I listen to (5:35 - 5:42)
you watch youtube videos well it was it (5:39 - 5:45)
was mostly you being upset about your (5:42 - 5:49)
iron banner games I got real foul (5:45 - 5:52)
language should but I learned it from (5:49 - 5:57)
you so you can't lie all those swears (5:52 - 5:59)
were things that I've heard you say when (5:57 - 6:01)
you were playing destiny I'm a bad (5:59 - 6:04)
influence that is very true and then (6:01 - 6:07)
today I had I went out to Joe's house he (6:04 - 6:10)
lives about an hour east of me and we (6:07 - 6:12)
stopped by a game shop that's by him I (6:10 - 6:15)
picked up some trial vanguard deck (6:12 - 6:16)
because I haven't played Vanguard in a (6:15 - 6:19)
real long time and we just played (6:16 - 6:21)
vanguard for a couple hours give some (6:19 - 6:22)
new mechanics in there which were a (6:21 - 6:24)
little tricky that didn't quite (6:22 - 6:27)
understand but it's still fun awesome i (6:24 - 6:29)
have i've never played Vanguard but I'm (6:27 - 6:33)
sure it's good no no is it better than (6:29 - 6:36)
that runner net runners pretty good well (6:33 - 6:40)
thing about Vanguard is like us in the (6:36 - 6:45)
world of TCG's it's it can be really (6:40 - 6:48)
complicated and simple at the same time (6:45 - 6:51)
I don't know how to explain that part of (6:48 - 6:54)
it but it's like each card has its own (6:51 - 6:56)
rule the rules really are just in the (6:54 - 6:59)
cards and so each card introduces its (6:56 - 7:00)
own (6:59 - 7:03)
set of rules so if you like when you're (7:00 - 7:04)
playing for the first time you have to (7:03 - 7:06)
literally like hold the card up to your (7:04 - 7:08)
face and read through the entire thing (7:06 - 7:11)
to understand what it's doing and how it (7:08 - 7:13)
affects what you're trying to do and (7:11 - 7:15)
then they've added this whole new (7:13 - 7:16)
mechanic in the path because I haven't (7:15 - 7:18)
played in like two years and this new (7:16 - 7:21)
mechanic of the the g'zone is what it's (7:18 - 7:24)
called and it's kind of like what in (7:21 - 7:25)
other games I guess would have been (7:24 - 7:28)
called a dock or you have a set of cards (7:25 - 7:30)
that aren't part of your deck a dog a (7:28 - 7:33)
dock no not a donk a doc it's on the (7:30 - 7:35)
side and you draw from it at certain (7:33 - 7:38)
points in the actual game but that's (7:35 - 7:40)
still the fundamental Vanguard is the (7:38 - 7:43)
same ah either way Joe beat me at every (7:40 - 7:45)
single game that we played so so there (7:43 - 7:49)
you go vintage show hey you know real (7:45 - 7:53)
quick Annapolis is lovely so all right (7:49 - 7:55)
nice to go out there while you were (7:53 - 7:58)
pioneer infuriating iron banner which I (7:55 - 7:59)
I took care of that this morning (7:58 - 8:02)
finished all my rank fives you got (7:59 - 8:05)
everybody to five yeah Wow it only took (8:02 - 8:09)
like 50 games but last night well well (8:05 - 8:10)
well was playing our banner I was (8:09 - 8:12)
playing a game called the witness which (8:10 - 8:17)
i believe is on ps4 and steam those are (8:12 - 8:19)
your two options is that a game where (8:17 - 8:21)
you go door-to-door and you try to get (8:19 - 8:25)
people to read your magazine no that (8:21 - 8:27)
sounds not I don't think it sounds more (8:25 - 8:29)
exciting the witness is a puzzle game (8:27 - 8:33)
made by the guy who made braids and I (8:29 - 8:35)
believe from what I've read he spent (8:33 - 8:36)
eight years making the game and there's (8:35 - 8:38)
over 500 puzzles in the game and they're (8:36 - 8:42)
all lying puzzles so the the simplest (8:38 - 8:45)
puzzle would be um draw a line from the (8:42 - 8:48)
start to the end and avoid the brakes in (8:45 - 8:52)
the map and then the first and then the (8:48 - 8:53)
game will introduce you rule so the (8:52 - 8:56)
first rule you learn is you have to (8:53 - 8:57)
separate the black squares from the (8:56 - 8:59)
white squares kind of sounds a little (8:57 - 9:02)
racist but it's not but so you have to (8:59 - 9:04)
draw your line between them and when you (9:02 - 9:06)
get to the end all the black squares (9:04 - 9:07)
have to be on one side all the white (9:06 - 9:08)
squares have to be in the other side (9:07 - 9:10)
then the second rule they introduced to (9:08 - 9:12)
you is these little like pac-man pellets (9:10 - 9:14)
where you have to (9:12 - 9:16)
draw a line and pick up all the pellets (9:14 - 9:19)
before you get to the end of it and then (9:16 - 9:22)
it gets more complex where now you have (9:19 - 9:24)
to not only separate the black and the (9:22 - 9:25)
white squares but you have to pick up (9:24 - 9:28)
the pellets along the way and if you're (9:25 - 9:31)
imagining this you can't go over the (9:28 - 9:32)
line you've already drawn it's blocked (9:31 - 9:35)
off so you only have so much room to (9:32 - 9:38)
solve the puzzle the game gets more (9:35 - 9:40)
complicated from that but I was very (9:38 - 9:43)
determined i'm completing it last night (9:40 - 9:46)
mostly because i wanted to see the (9:43 - 9:49)
ending and i just wanted to you know get (9:46 - 9:52)
it off get off my plate for games that (9:49 - 9:54)
are coming up but i really enjoyed it I (9:52 - 9:57)
think it's great it's a it's it's 39 99 (9:54 - 10:00)
on PSN when I bought it which it came (9:57 - 10:02)
out last Tuesday I think it's a great (10:00 - 10:03)
game if you like puzzles if you don't (10:02 - 10:05)
like puzzles probably not your cup of (10:03 - 10:07)
tea because when you do something that (10:05 - 10:10)
is rewarding as in solving a very (10:07 - 10:12)
complicated puzzle or figuring it out it (10:10 - 10:15)
rewards you with more puzzles so if you (10:12 - 10:16)
don't like puzzles probably not for you (10:15 - 10:18)
I've been told and I haven't played (10:16 - 10:20)
played it but I've been told it's (10:18 - 10:23)
similar to mist in a way well I'll be (10:20 - 10:25)
the judge of that since I played like (10:23 - 10:29)
four out of the five versions of mr. so (10:25 - 10:32)
yeah I've never played missed so I can't (10:29 - 10:34)
really compare it but I'm sure I would (10:32 - 10:36)
like it but that was the game I've been (10:34 - 10:39)
playing and besides destiny and i'll (10:36 - 10:41)
probably be getting back into monster (10:39 - 10:43)
hunter this week since iron banner will (10:41 - 10:46)
be over and the iron banner slack where (10:43 - 10:48)
the iron Bay the monster hunter slack (10:46 - 10:51)
community the slack chant channel 4 (10:48 - 10:53)

that you guys are still doing that and (10:56 - 11:01)
the way I got past a like a roadblock I (10:58 - 11:02)
had had in monster hunter so now i'm i'm (11:01 - 11:05)

Nintendo 3ds four tds they can get a (13:04 - 13:08)

I had addressed to two weeks ago was no (14:57 - 15:03)

gonna have to Ethernet those we use (15:08 - 15:11)
together to keep your 60 frames which (15:09 - 15:13)

price of 1500 yen the game is already (17:08 - 17:13)
available for pre download in the game a (17:11 - 17:16)
boy named Tim Goodman comes to rhyme (17:13 - 17:18)
City to make to meet the great detective (17:16 - 17:22)
Pikachu thus Pikachu is able to talk and (17:18 - 17:25)
where deerstalker a kind of hat (17:22 - 17:27)
associated with sure like I didn't know (17:25 - 17:29)
that's what the hell was called yeah it (17:27 - 17:33)
is the deers that's a cool hat name but (17:29 - 17:34)
even with their flaps that you tie up (17:33 - 17:36)
right there on top of the head I thought (17:34 - 17:38)
it was just called a detective hat ah (17:36 - 17:41)
it's called a deerstalker hang that's (17:38 - 17:44)
real cool a game is an issue this is (17:41 - 17:46)
just some that's just some commercial (17:44 - 17:49)
information so yeah it's a downloadable (17:46 - 17:52)
game this was a game we saw almost two (17:49 - 17:55)
years ago it was like a talked about two (17:52 - 17:56)
years ago yeah just talked about was (17:55 - 17:58)
rumored and then it went off everyone's (17:56 - 17:59)
radar and they are they brought it back (17:58 - 18:04)
so I would imagine for you know 12 $15 (17:59 - 18:05)
it's not (18:04 - 18:08)
terribly long game and without getting a (18:05 - 18:10)
physical release I'm sure it's just a (18:08 - 18:12)
cute little side project that they're (18:10 - 18:16)
doing that that'll probably be fun and I (18:12 - 18:19)
think um from what i heard the video or (18:16 - 18:22)
like the rhyme city is actually boston (18:19 - 18:26)
oh really yeah i don't know i mean i've (18:22 - 18:28)
never paid much attention even when i (18:26 - 18:31)
was in Boston so (18:28 - 18:31)
there is a no release date outside of (18:31 - 18:36)
Japan at this point so we don't know if (18:35 - 18:38)
it would ever come to the States but I (18:36 - 18:40)
would imagine because if because it's (18:38 - 18:43)
pokemons 20th anniversary this year that (18:40 - 18:45)
that we would be seeing it probably (18:43 - 18:49)
later this year well I can I don't know (18:45 - 18:53)
if you have a news item about the the (18:49 - 18:55)
what is that thing it's like everybody (18:53 - 18:57)
signs it bunch of signatures on there oh (18:55 - 18:59)
I don't want to talk about how dumb that (18:57 - 19:01)
is ok I do want to talk about how dumb (18:59 - 19:03)
that is because if if you are signing (19:01 - 19:07)
that to have the voice of a damn davido (19:03 - 19:11)
detective Pikachu be Danny DeVito III (19:07 - 19:13)
don't know you I don't I think Danny (19:11 - 19:16)
DeVito is there's nothing to do with (19:13 - 19:20)
children and and goodness and no no yeah (19:16 - 19:23)
you're not a not very maybe I mean maybe (19:20 - 19:25)
he is in his personal life but at least (19:23 - 19:27)
on the TV shows he's on he's not very (19:25 - 19:30)
child-friendly so to talk about this (19:27 - 19:31)
real quick because he brought it up (19:30 - 19:33)
there is a online petition for danny d (19:31 - 19:36)
and that's the word I was Danny DeVito (19:33 - 19:37)
to be the voice of Detective Pikachu (19:36 - 19:39)
since this pikachu will be actually (19:37 - 19:41)
talking let me tell you why it's dumb (19:39 - 19:44)
name one online petition that has been (19:41 - 19:46)
successful I mean a couple of the things (19:44 - 19:49)
that change.org does that those are (19:46 - 19:53)
successful are they well I signed one (19:49 - 19:54)
that I'm not going to talk about but (19:53 - 19:58)
yeah it was successful I mean there was (19:54 - 20:01)
like the most recent dumb online (19:58 - 20:05)
petition was to get rid of Metroid (20:01 - 20:07)
hunters or whatever that game they (20:05 - 20:10)
showed at e3 last year it was like this (20:07 - 20:11)
was the metroid game we didn't want (20:10 - 20:14)
nintendo we're making a petition so you (20:11 - 20:17)
guys stop making it now it's a nice dumb (20:14 - 20:20)
yeah yeah I can't think of an online I (20:17 - 20:22)
can't think of a online petition that (20:20 - 20:25)
has affected stuff that I directly like (20:22 - 20:28)
in life to be successful and I can tell (20:25 - 20:29)
you right now Danny DeVito's not going (20:28 - 20:32)
to be the voice the detective picture (20:29 - 20:35)
you know who make a great voice for (20:32 - 20:37)
detective Pikachu our friend Jake bake (20:35 - 20:40)
he can do lots of voices that's true (20:37 - 20:43)
fake fake I mean you're you're making (20:40 - 20:44)
your so (20:43 - 20:46)
besides the fact that all I'm (20:44 - 20:47)
petitioning is pretty much dumb like if (20:46 - 20:49)
you want anything to be if you want (20:47 - 20:51)
anything to have merit and carry weight (20:49 - 20:54)
a phone call does that better and a (20:51 - 20:58)
written letter does that better just (20:54 - 21:00)
going to a website and signing your name (20:58 - 21:03)
doesn't hold much merit but the the (21:00 - 21:05)
petition is saying one all these people (21:03 - 21:09)
want Danny DeVito even though who knows (21:05 - 21:10)
if Pokemon company has probably already (21:09 - 21:12)
picked someone in mind but to you're (21:10 - 21:14)
under the assumption that he wants to do (21:12 - 21:16)
it it would be it would be a totally (21:14 - 21:18)
different story if he would have tweeted (21:16 - 21:20)
man would I like to be the voice actor (21:18 - 21:23)
of Pikachu but he didn't you have two (21:20 - 21:25)
parties that I have zero communication (21:23 - 21:27)
with each other and people are making a (21:25 - 21:30)
petition saying this should happen and (21:27 - 21:33)
it's not it's it's dumb (21:30 - 21:33)
well there you go thank you you you know (21:34 - 21:39)

of Detective Pikachu and then you guys (21:44 - 21:49)
can make petition hmm i don't want here (21:46 - 21:51)
a little too young that nobody would (21:49 - 21:52)
actually believe that you could be a (21:51 - 21:56)
detective that's yeah I I don't own a (21:52 - 21:58)

game and pokin tournament competitions (24:13 - 24:19)
since 2010 the u.s. national (24:15 - 24:21)
championship was consistently held at (24:19 - 24:24)
the indian it indiana convention center (24:21 - 24:26)
in indianapolis indiana the reason for (24:24 - 24:28)
the move has not officially been stated (24:26 - 24:31)
they tuned for more details that's kind (24:28 - 24:35)
of big news i think uh it is um and you (24:31 - 24:37)
know i can i can go back to things I've (24:35 - 24:39)
said previous on previous episodes about (24:37 - 24:40)
how I've grown comfortable with (24:39 - 24:43)
Indianapolis and now you're throwing it (24:40 - 24:46)
over to Columbus yes you're also leaving (24:43 - 24:50)
me about two hours on my drive so you (24:46 - 24:52)
know it's going from a 10 hour drive to (24:50 - 24:54)
an eight hour drive that's four hours (24:52 - 24:57)
total from there back yeah but they're (24:54 - 24:59)
like days apart so it doesn't make that (24:57 - 25:03)
much different um and and I looked at (24:59 - 25:07)
the hotel information for Columbus and I (25:03 - 25:11)
was no bueno not not too pleased what (25:07 - 25:14)
was what was the deets why I'm out here (25:11 - 25:16)
well they do have so they have a hotel (25:14 - 25:18)
that's connected to the convention (25:16 - 25:19)
center which is obviously the one that (25:18 - 25:23)
you want to get a hotel room at and it's (25:19 - 25:24)
like the cheapest room i think was like (25:23 - 25:28)
two hundred dollars a night ah which is (25:24 - 25:30)
more than we're paying for our gencon (25:28 - 25:33)
hotels well you guys got a good dr kinda (25:30 - 25:35)
got shafted what do you mean you got a (25:33 - 25:38)
hotel and down down indiana yeah but now (25:35 - 25:40)
I'm separated from you guys well dump (25:38 - 25:42)
your hotel and come stake 10 miles away (25:40 - 25:44)
with us I mean I can I got pay fifty (25:42 - 25:47)
dollars to dump it what's 52 hours it's (25:44 - 25:49)
a fifty-dollar cancellation fee yeah but (25:47 - 25:52)
what's fifty dollars tu I mean I have to (25:49 - 25:54)
check the wyndham still has hotels but i (25:52 - 25:56)
just spent forty dollars in a video game (25:54 - 25:57)
that you played in three days that (25:56 - 26:00)
you'll never play ever again 40 (25:57 - 26:02)
yeah we're dollars and you're out there (26:00 - 26:05)
in the hotel with us 7 a grand old time (26:02 - 26:08)
that's true but i was thinking also that (26:05 - 26:11)
if i do the podcast thing this year Oh (26:08 - 26:14)
presumptuous well yeah you know meaning (26:11 - 26:17)
that i won't be like what if but now you (26:14 - 26:19)
know this is getting a little inside (26:17 - 26:22)
baseball as they like to say I'm the (26:19 - 26:24)
co-host of your other podcast what if (26:22 - 26:26)
they like me better what if they want me (26:24 - 26:31)
to come podcast I mean yeah why not (26:26 - 26:34)
because I've got a hotel that's 11 miles (26:31 - 26:37)
away and obviously by your criteria (26:34 - 26:39)
that's too far for podcasting I mean (26:37 - 26:41)
that I made it work lat I'm just like I (26:39 - 26:43)
made it work last year but I didn't work (26:41 - 26:45)
because I drove and I Snyder I sign in (26:43 - 26:47)
the morning to drive you home say I (26:45 - 26:50)
don't want to inconvenience anyone I (26:47 - 26:52)
understand we're getting we're gonna (26:50 - 26:54)
we're getting off topic here uh 200 out (26:52 - 26:57)
of the night that's expensive yeah but (26:54 - 26:59)
I'm sure Columbus is a lovely place to (26:57 - 27:00)
ensure there's other hotel so I want to (26:59 - 27:03)
say when I when I stayed at nationals (27:00 - 27:07)
three years ago stay it was Irene and I (27:03 - 27:11)
and a friend and his girlfriend and we (27:07 - 27:13)
stay at the Marriott which is connected (27:11 - 27:15)
to the Indianapolis convention center (27:13 - 27:18)
which Mary I was very nice hotel i (27:15 - 27:20)
believe it was 169 a night obviously if (27:18 - 27:22)
you split that in half only pain like 90 (27:20 - 27:24)
bucks after tax a night and three nights (27:22 - 27:28)
that's not too bad but 200 bucks oh yeah (27:24 - 27:30)
and you want to get there a day early (27:28 - 27:32)
and you want to stay a day extra but (27:30 - 27:35)
that's a two hours extra on my drive two (27:32 - 27:37)
hours less on your drive so now we're (27:35 - 27:39)
eat we're equally eight hours apart each (27:37 - 27:41)
yeah I don't know anything about (27:39 - 27:44)
Columbus you know it could be that (27:41 - 27:46)
there's plenty of hotels in that area or (27:44 - 27:48)
it could be like Fort Wayne and you have (27:46 - 27:50)
to drive from every hotel no matter (27:48 - 27:53)
where it is I would be curious to look (27:50 - 27:56)
up the Indianapolis convention center (27:53 - 27:58)
and see if somebody paid more money (27:56 - 28:01)
and/or booked those dates already (27:58 - 28:05)
intriguing and pokemon just didn't wanna (28:01 - 28:08)
pony up the cash for it unless our new (28:05 - 28:10)
thing is just to move convention centers (28:08 - 28:13)
for like to get more people to come you (28:10 - 28:14)
know it's very easy (28:13 - 28:17)
for people in Indiana to go to Pokemon (28:14 - 28:18)
set this right there but you know two (28:17 - 28:22)
hours is is a no pun intended a (28:18 - 28:25)
roadblock for a lot of people really two (28:22 - 28:28)
hours I mean if you're if it's in your (28:25 - 28:32)
town it finally you really have no (28:28 - 28:33)
reason not to go whereas if it's two (28:32 - 28:35)
hours away that's that's enough to say (28:33 - 28:38)
I'm not really ready my teams already I (28:35 - 28:41)
can't afford a hotel you know I mean (28:38 - 28:44)
well I know what I that there's nothing (28:41 - 28:46)
scheduled in the Indianapolis convention (28:44 - 28:48)
center for the July fourth weekend so (28:46 - 28:51)
maybe that's not posted yet I'm done we (28:48 - 28:54)
got a lot of stuff posted yeah I don't (28:51 - 28:56)
know it's interesting it's interesting (28:54 - 28:59)
we got one more bit of news here are we (28:56 - 29:00)
still up in the air you're are you (28:59 - 29:02)
committed to not going or you're still (29:00 - 29:08)
iffy or NAT for us nationals yeah a man (29:02 - 29:10)

team together yeah I hear it well I mean (29:10 - 29:15)
there's also TCG and pokin you got two (29:13 - 29:17)

mean and there then I got the no break (29:21 - 29:27)
mechanic in there and yeah oh yeah i'm (29:23 - 29:29)
at my big my big problem with Nationals (29:27 - 29:32)
is always so close to gencon yeah I knew (29:29 - 29:34)
and there they were I well for the past (29:32 - 29:36)
six years they were on the same location (29:34 - 29:38)
obviously not now Nationals is farther (29:36 - 29:41)
for me but when you're spending a (29:38 - 29:44)
thousand dollars at gencon just for (29:41 - 29:49)
housing or hotels alone plus the time or (29:44 - 29:51)
plus the time to get off it's it's hard (29:49 - 29:54)
to swing both and I'm not gonna lie (29:51 - 29:58)
gencon is a fuller experience in every (29:54 - 30:01)
aspect then the name and then they do (29:58 - 30:04)
have pokemon at gencon but they don't (30:01 - 30:06)
have Pathfinder it i think i think the (30:04 - 30:08)
problem so the problem with Nationals is (30:06 - 30:12)
a couple things you either have to be (30:08 - 30:15)
really competitive in either the TCG of (30:12 - 30:18)
the video game and if you're not which (30:15 - 30:21)
is fine but if you are I'll get to the (30:18 - 30:26)
not if you are your whole day is wake up (30:21 - 30:27)
early (30:26 - 30:30)
play your match wait anywhere between (30:27 - 30:33)
ten minutes to an hour you can't do much (30:30 - 30:35)
because you're waiting results play your (30:33 - 30:38)
next match rinse and repeat and almost (30:35 - 30:41)
always almost always you get screwed on (30:38 - 30:45)
lunch yeah like they the tournament (30:41 - 30:47)
organizers haven't figured out like your (30:45 - 30:49)
day is stressful and if it's not that's (30:47 - 30:52)
cool like you're calm collected player (30:49 - 30:53)
but I would say the majority of people (30:52 - 30:56)
competing are stressed lunch is like the (30:53 - 30:59)
one Savior to your day and you almost (30:56 - 31:01)
always get screwed up so you look at the (30:59 - 31:02)
notes if there's a shopping mall (31:01 - 31:04)
connected to the Columbus Convention (31:02 - 31:06)
Center yeah I don't I don't know what (31:04 - 31:08)
the food that you ate at chick-fil-a (31:06 - 31:12)
chick-fil-a right yeah um so now you you (31:08 - 31:16)
on the other so your days are full if (31:12 - 31:18)
you're competing competitively your days (31:16 - 31:20)
are full readers how much you're gonna (31:18 - 31:23)
do besides compete and then usually by (31:20 - 31:24)
the time competitions over your kind of (31:23 - 31:26)
pooped out you're done that wraps up I (31:24 - 31:28)
mean they wrapped up at like seven or (31:26 - 31:30)
eight last year I feel like from what I (31:28 - 31:34)
got pretty late and inside you can stay (31:30 - 31:36)
up or do anything because you are on a (31:34 - 31:38)
schedule of okay we need to be up by 9am (31:36 - 31:41)
its tournament starts at ten well blah (31:38 - 31:43)
so let's go to the other aspect you're (31:41 - 31:46)
going there for the love of Pokemon (31:43 - 31:47)
you're not competing competitively (31:46 - 31:49)
unfortunately there's not much for you (31:47 - 31:52)
to do like you can play inside things (31:49 - 31:57)
but how it's this like that to me to (31:52 - 31:58)
playing a side thing that's like two (31:57 - 32:00)
hours of entertainment that's like three (31:58 - 32:02)
hours of entertainment that is not an (32:00 - 32:04)
eight hour event that I want to sit at (32:02 - 32:06)
and then the other aspects oh well (32:04 - 32:08)
there's there's pokemon stuff I can buy (32:06 - 32:11)
and / might've from the last four years (32:08 - 32:13)
that I went it was not official pokemon (32:11 - 32:16)
stuff it was like four vendors with up (32:13 - 32:18)
marked pokemon stuff that they imported (32:16 - 32:22)
from Japan or that they found on ebay (32:18 - 32:25)
that they're selling it the they're just (32:22 - 32:28)
like two rooms of small vendors not a me (32:25 - 32:30)
I hate don't get me wrong I love to (32:28 - 32:33)
spend money especially I'm pokemon stuff (32:30 - 32:36)
but none of that even appealed to me to (32:33 - 32:38)
buy well yeah I mean it's mostly (32:36 - 32:41)
intended like if you want to buy select (32:38 - 32:44)
cards right specific cards or if you (32:41 - 32:46)
want to sell all your cards as i know (32:44 - 32:49)
someone did one year but you know saying (32:46 - 32:51)
all that if a bunch of dudes wants to (32:49 - 32:54)
get together and do road trip and pile (32:51 - 32:56)
into a hotel room I could still be (32:54 - 32:58)
convinced to go yeah I mean I could be (32:56 - 33:01)
convinced but i like it like i said if (32:58 - 33:03)
they weren't so close it be an easier (33:01 - 33:04)
argument well at least with the gencon (33:03 - 33:06)
it's like I wake up when I want to stay (33:04 - 33:08)
up what i want i'm not on the schedule (33:06 - 33:10)
i'm not feeling competitive so many (33:08 - 33:12)
things to do so I mean that's why it (33:10 - 33:14)
wins out to me plus there is the pokemon (33:12 - 33:17)
stuff there's hundreds of street passes (33:14 - 33:19)
every hour that you can get there are oh (33:17 - 33:21)
yeah like you battled it select this (33:19 - 33:23)
tons of Pokemon cosplay like it's very (33:21 - 33:25)
easy to find a battle if you want (33:23 - 33:27)
there's a TCG sit like and that's well (33:25 - 33:28)
that's the only reason why I'm comparing (33:27 - 33:30)
is because it's not like I'm going to (33:28 - 33:32)
Jen come to ignore pokemon but there is (33:30 - 33:35)
a Pokemon presence at gencon and so to (33:32 - 33:37)
me that's where I want to put my time my (33:35 - 33:39)
vacation to my money in because I'm (33:37 - 33:42)
going to get a more rich experience yeah (33:39 - 33:44)
because you can play pokemon and you can (33:42 - 33:47)
play the WWE superstars game the Thrive (33:44 - 33:49)
which i saw in the store today and (33:47 - 33:51)
almost bought but stopped myself I was (33:49 - 33:53)
angry I woke up this morning no joke no (33:51 - 33:54)
joke I woke up this morning and I was (33:53 - 33:55)
like I think I'm going to take the (33:54 - 33:57)
shrink wrap off and actually sit down (33:55 - 34:00)
and read the rulebook because I I got (33:57 - 34:02)
that itch to play it's a good game it's (34:00 - 34:05)
not a bad game it's not about him I mean (34:02 - 34:06)
it's made by the same people who made (34:05 - 34:08)
the Firefly board game which is very (34:06 - 34:11)
very popular last bit of news here the (34:08 - 34:14)

that's pretty much all the news there i (34:27 - 34:31)
mean well i'm glad they're doing that (34:30 - 34:33)
because they're getting rid of Doctor (34:31 - 34:33)
Who and they're actually putting (34:33 - 34:35)
something good on there you go I'm (34:33 - 34:38)
getting I like Doctor Who uh-huh sad to (34:35 - 34:40)
see it go off netflix but i've never (34:38 - 34:42)
seen the dancing movie so yeah I've not (34:40 - 34:44)
seen the dancing movie I want to see (34:42 - 34:47)
that Irene just renewed our netflix (34:44 - 34:49)
subscription I actually cancelled it (34:47 - 34:51)
like a year ago I was so tired of paying (34:49 - 34:52)
10 bucks a month for not watching (34:51 - 34:54)
anything but she's now paying the ten (34:52 - 34:55)
dollars (34:54 - 34:57)
when I was Jesse's mind as I don't ever (34:55 - 35:00)
watch next place oh yeah I already stole (34:57 - 35:03)
your hulu that's true I would be I'm (35:00 - 35:05)
very very interested in seeing Pokemon (35:03 - 35:07)
the series X&Y after you talk so highly (35:05 - 35:10)
about it well so yeah oh man it's so (35:07 - 35:13)
good I'm it maybe I'll I was gonna maybe (35:10 - 35:14)
I'll started tonight but I gotta wait (35:13 - 35:19)
like 10 more hours or to show up oh yeah (35:14 - 35:21)
not getting very first yet it does say (35:19 - 35:23)
the older movies and the older episodes (35:21 - 35:25)
would be removed i think the only (35:23 - 35:27)
episodes that were remaining was black (35:25 - 35:30)
and white stuff and who needs that black (35:27 - 35:34)
and white was terrible that's not true (35:30 - 35:34)
and i don't understand these series (35:35 - 35:39)
where they like they'll do like oh our (35:37 - 35:41)
first three seasons are on hulu and our (35:39 - 35:44)
next four seasons are on netflix and (35:41 - 35:46)
then we've got like two seasons are (35:44 - 35:48)
online only on our app and like why (35:46 - 35:50)
can't everything just be in one place (35:48 - 35:55)
you know I feel so there are over 700 (35:50 - 35:57)
episodes of the Pokemon anime maybe even (35:55 - 36:00)
more I'm just trying to add numbers in (35:57 - 36:05)
my head and there are you know 19 movies (36:00 - 36:09)
Pokemon could in theory do its own (36:05 - 36:10)
network for like four ninety-nine a (36:09 - 36:13)
month to watch it all oh yeah they got (36:10 - 36:17)
more collateral than the WWE they could (36:13 - 36:20)
do it I mean IIIi think I think they (36:17 - 36:23)
could pull it off and I 999 would be (36:20 - 36:25)
steep for unlimited Pokemon I mean you (36:23 - 36:27)
couldn't consume that you couldn't (36:25 - 36:29)
consume that in a weekend or a week or (36:27 - 36:32)
anything like that but I think 499 would (36:29 - 36:35)
be a I would feel comfortable paying for (36:32 - 36:37)
a Pokemon TV app that just gives me all (36:35 - 36:41)
of it no this is what we need we need a (36:37 - 36:44)
Pokemon app call it Pokemon TV call it (36:41 - 36:46)
what you want but it's going to have all (36:44 - 36:50)
the seasons of all the cartoon shows (36:46 - 36:52)
every episode it's going to have all the (36:50 - 36:55)
movies and it's going to do streaming (36:52 - 36:57)
like the WWE app does where they have (36:55 - 36:59)
their own shows that are like these (36:57 - 37:00)
short form shows if they've put together (36:59 - 37:02)
and documentaries or whatever there'll (37:00 - 37:04)
be more documentaries over time and you (37:02 - 37:06)
know what else is going to feature it's (37:04 - 37:08)
going to feature Pokemon podcast it's (37:06 - 37:09)
super effective (37:08 - 37:13)
sweet to our block it's gonna have Kyle (37:09 - 37:16)
suka he'll do or like a TCG (37:13 - 37:20)
insiders look kind of show uh I don't (37:16 - 37:23)
know it has some of them VGC youtubers (37:20 - 37:25)
get on there they'll have their own (37:23 - 37:28)
shows and then we'll all be rich right (37:25 - 37:31)
it'll cost them very little money it'll (37:28 - 37:33)
put a lot of money into my pocket and (37:31 - 37:35)
everyone's gonna be happy cuz it's got (37:33 - 37:37)
me like you could just turn on Pokemon (37:35 - 37:39)
TV and veg out and have a good old time (37:37 - 37:42)
and like breed your pokemons Pokemon (37:39 - 37:45)

Pokemon TV app already exists and it (37:48 - 37:52)
already gives you what do they rotate (37:51 - 37:54)
the rotate episodes out every two weeks (37:52 - 37:56)

they do like four different seasons like (37:56 - 38:00)
five episodes from four different seas (37:58 - 38:02)

that will continue paying for month (38:07 - 38:11)
