[Music] (0:01 - 0:16)
[Applause] (0:16 - 0:22)
[Music] (0:16 - 0:22)
uh what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:31)
final episode of super picnic club we (0:26 - 0:34)
did it do you promise (0:31 - 0:34)
promise we talk about picnics finally (0:34 - 0:39)
promises the final one yeah yeah now (0:36 - 0:41)
this this will be the final one uh we (0:39 - 0:43)
you know we could have gone there was (0:41 - 0:44)
there was a point where I was like oh do (0:43 - 0:46)
we do like seven or eight and then it (0:44 - 0:48)
was like let's just put Elite Four and (0:46 - 0:50)
gyms all together here (0:48 - 0:53)
um it makes sense uh Greg is here hello (0:50 - 0:58)
Demar regatto Mr Roboto uh and Al is (0:53 - 0:59)
here (0:58 - 1:01)
I I don't have something clever to say (0:59 - 1:04)
this time all right that's fair (1:01 - 1:09)
that's fair okay so uh if you have (1:04 - 1:13)
beaten Arvin and you have beaten uh the (1:09 - 1:16)
Elite Four and you've beaten Penny aka (1:13 - 1:22)
Big Boss AKA Cassiopeia AKA BB AKA (1:16 - 1:24)
yeah they called her BB for quite a (1:22 - 1:26)
while (1:24 - 1:28)
yeah yeah (1:26 - 1:32)
that that girl has so many things (1:28 - 1:32)
be my favorite part about her is I don't (1:33 - 1:37)
even have one nickname (1:35 - 1:39)
that you know of yeah that's true I (1:37 - 1:40)
don't know I don't know what the YouTube (1:39 - 1:42)
comments are calling me I do I read them (1:40 - 1:45)
all uh okay so (1:42 - 1:46)
uh we're gonna be talking about area (1:45 - 1:50)
zero which is uh let's crack open a (1:46 - 1:52)
whole nother storyline last minute (1:50 - 1:55)
uh which I mean I think I think it's (1:52 - 1:58)
fine look before before we open the gate (1:55 - 2:01)
and dive into area zero (1:58 - 2:03)
uh I know you two might disagree with me (2:01 - 2:07)
but I absolutely loved the pacing of (2:03 - 2:08)
this game (2:07 - 2:10)
um I've played a lot of open world games (2:08 - 2:12)
we did have that discussion of like what (2:10 - 2:14)
open world games did you play how many (2:12 - 2:16)
did you play uh all that stuff I played (2:14 - 2:17)
a lot of open world games (2:16 - 2:21)
um and sometimes the you know the the (2:17 - 2:23)
the main story they want you to go (2:21 - 2:24)
through isn't particularly interesting (2:23 - 2:27)
sometimes you find a Side Story that's (2:24 - 2:28)
really compelling and you want to see (2:27 - 2:30)
that all the way through (2:28 - 2:31)
um sometimes you don't care about any of (2:30 - 2:33)
the story but like the world and the (2:31 - 2:35)
combat and the things you do are just (2:33 - 2:37)
good enough to make you explore and do (2:35 - 2:40)
everything I felt that way with (2:37 - 2:42)
two minutes in breath of the wild did (2:40 - 2:45)
not care at all about defeating Ganon or (2:42 - 2:47)
or saving Princess Zelda but that world (2:45 - 2:50)
to me was absolutely amazing to explore (2:47 - 2:54)
and combat was great uh and that's what (2:50 - 2:56)
kept me going I know for some people it (2:54 - 2:59)
might have been to save Zelda I I I (2:56 - 3:01)
didn't really care I don't think you (2:59 - 3:03)
saved Zelda in breath of the wild yeah (3:01 - 3:05)
you see usually save her you've saved (3:03 - 3:07)
the the kingdom you saved the kingdom (3:05 - 3:11)
yeah yeah yeah yeah with Zelda's help (3:07 - 3:13)
like if it weren't for Zelda we'd all (3:11 - 3:15)
have been dead a hundred years yeah I (3:13 - 3:17)
mean and I will say that I played one (3:15 - 3:20)
open world game for 10 years (3:17 - 3:23)
you know do you sometimes wish you had (3:20 - 3:25)
that time back (3:23 - 3:29)
no uh I mean like I learned a lot in (3:25 - 3:31)
that game I was part of the early car (3:29 - 3:32)
like I learned a lot about the world (3:31 - 3:35)
about how companies were controversy (3:32 - 3:37)
like for as crappy as World of Warcraft (3:35 - 3:41)
ended up being like I enjoyed my time (3:37 - 3:44)
and it taught me both very good and very (3:41 - 3:46)
bad lessons (3:44 - 3:48)
yeah I mean I absolutely adored Final (3:46 - 3:50)
Fantasy 14 (3:48 - 3:53)
um and the hands down my (3:50 - 3:55)
like if if you want to know what a good (3:53 - 3:59)
RPG story is that has voice acting and (3:55 - 4:01)
cutscenes while your main character (3:59 - 4:02)
never says the world (4:01 - 4:05)
this is the game play Final Fantasy 14 (4:02 - 4:09)
the only game that has made me cry (4:05 - 4:12)
multiple times yeah two different (4:09 - 4:14)
expansions (4:12 - 4:17)
I know people talk about how great that (4:14 - 4:19)
story is and there were story beats I (4:17 - 4:20)
definitely like I was like oh this is (4:19 - 4:21)
really cool but there was a lot in Final (4:20 - 4:24)
Fantasy 14 especially um A Realm Reborn (4:21 - 4:26)
where I was like I just don't just get (4:24 - 4:27)
me through the end I just want to do the (4:26 - 4:30)
raids everybody whoever born is the (4:27 - 4:32)
worst which is why they've cut it down (4:30 - 4:34)
too yeah yeah a third of his size and (4:32 - 4:37)
and you know I that that just my (4:34 - 4:39)
preference a realm reward jaded me going (4:37 - 4:41)
into Heaven's word and people were like (4:39 - 4:42)
oh Heaven's word is better but it's like (4:41 - 4:45)
ugh I had to suffer throw around we're (4:42 - 4:49)
born anyways but like I liked the Titan (4:45 - 4:51)
stuff so much that I wanted to see it (4:49 - 4:53)
through I like the team star stuff we've (4:51 - 4:54)
talked about that I wanted to see it (4:53 - 4:57)
through uh the champion stuff was (4:54 - 4:59)
exactly what it was like there was no (4:57 - 5:01)
twist there was no turns it was fine (4:59 - 5:03)
like obviously I we said last episode (5:01 - 5:05)
very traditional experience that they (5:03 - 5:06)
went with (5:05 - 5:07)
um (5:06 - 5:10)
the thing that like really made me so (5:07 - 5:12)
happy with these games (5:10 - 5:16)
um is that and up to this point there is (5:12 - 5:17)
no save the world (5:16 - 5:19)
yeah we talked about this in I think the (5:17 - 5:21)
first episode because none of us had (5:19 - 5:24)
done 80oz at this point we all I don't (5:21 - 5:25)
think any has visited finished all three (5:24 - 5:27)
of the quests and we so we were just (5:25 - 5:29)
like oh it's it's quite nice there's no (5:27 - 5:31)
like save the oh wait here it is we (5:29 - 5:35)
found it we've we found it yes (5:31 - 5:38)
but I I will put a pin in that I didn't (5:35 - 5:41)
want to bring it up but (5:38 - 5:43)
the iron tight (5:41 - 5:45)
the iron titan (5:43 - 5:48)
battle the one that's in the desert yeah (5:45 - 5:51)
was when I guessed what the end plot was (5:48 - 5:54)
oh sure I thought okay we'll we'll skip (5:51 - 5:56)
around I I want to get to this point but (5:54 - 5:58)
like when they get to the Save the World (5:56 - 6:01)
Part it to me makes sense (5:58 - 6:04)
and it's done I think pretty well (6:01 - 6:06)
it's done good enough where I where like (6:04 - 6:09)
it was it was fine it was acceptable I (6:06 - 6:11)
think here here's the thing they did a (6:09 - 6:13)
thing in this game that I've been saying (6:11 - 6:16)
for all of the plot lines (6:13 - 6:19)
they finally gave it human connection (6:16 - 6:22)
and human emotion and the ending works (6:19 - 6:25)
because really the plot line that's the (6:22 - 6:29)
most important is the human one and less (6:25 - 6:31)
about saving the world right there is (6:29 - 6:34)
another huge emotional tie that you're (6:31 - 6:37)
dealing with that carries that plot just (6:34 - 6:38)
like you've had an emotional type for (6:37 - 6:40)
the all the other ones except for the (6:38 - 6:42)
gym leaders (6:40 - 6:44)
um and they really need to focus on (6:42 - 6:46)
keeping these stories (6:44 - 6:49)
human-based and human emotion and not (6:46 - 6:52)
these grandiose cuckoo banana things (6:49 - 6:55)
like the ending Works brilliantly in a (6:52 - 6:57)
lot of ways because (6:55 - 6:59)
what about shiny (6:57 - 7:02)
you are diamonds and pearls we're not (6:59 - 7:06)
doing that get off this call uh simply (7:02 - 7:09)
because you have you have made a number (7:06 - 7:12)
of human feeling emotional connections (7:09 - 7:14)
and if if they hadn't done that work (7:12 - 7:16)
beforehand that whole bottom area would (7:14 - 7:18)
have fallen flat on his face (7:16 - 7:20)
here's here's the thing with Pokemon (7:18 - 7:21)
that I think (7:20 - 7:25)
got lost for 20 some years and I think I (7:21 - 7:26)
said this very early on in one of our (7:25 - 7:29)
episodes uh because I think I brought up (7:26 - 7:30)
like Team Rocket (7:29 - 7:32)
um in in Kanto (7:30 - 7:34)
when I fell in love with the series (7:32 - 7:38)
right I I found the anime first and we (7:34 - 7:40)
can talk about how the anime is geared (7:38 - 7:44)
towards kids although I don't obviously (7:40 - 7:44)
it the whole series is not the whole the (7:45 - 7:50)
whole franchise is is geared towards (7:48 - 7:53)
everyone anyone they can get they want (7:50 - 7:55)
they want adults they want kids they (7:53 - 7:58)
want teenagers they want grandpas right (7:55 - 8:00)
at a certain point you know us that were (7:58 - 8:04)
10 are now 30 and in 20 more years we'll (8:00 - 8:07)
be 50 they still want us right some of (8:04 - 8:09)
us already there some of us are already (8:07 - 8:12)
there it's like it's like Disney I don't (8:09 - 8:14)
think anyone at this point would argue (8:12 - 8:18)
that Disney is for kids Disney Cruises (8:14 - 8:20)
Disney World like the amount of merch (8:18 - 8:23)
the amount of nostalgia they rely on no (8:20 - 8:25)
company like there's never going to be a (8:23 - 8:26)
point where the Pokemon company is like (8:25 - 8:28)
we're for kids because they are (8:26 - 8:30)
alienated they are alienating Their (8:28 - 8:33)
audience if they say that they are for (8:30 - 8:35)
everyone and they Market towards (8:33 - 8:38)
everyone You could argue maybe 20 years (8:35 - 8:40)
ago they were not doing that but even (8:38 - 8:44)
Nintendo they want every single person (8:40 - 8:47)
out there to own a video game system and (8:44 - 8:49)
I I would argue that they did a pretty (8:47 - 8:50)
good job when the Wii came out because I (8:49 - 8:53)
I knew parents (8:50 - 8:55)
that wanted a wee in their house for the (8:53 - 8:59)
first time I knew people that worked in (8:55 - 9:01)
nursing homes they were they would come (8:59 - 9:02)
in they would be like hey do you guys I (9:01 - 9:03)
worked at GameStop during this time this (9:02 - 9:05)
is why I know this they would come we (9:03 - 9:06)
were looking for wheeze we want (9:05 - 9:08)
something to put in the the nursing home (9:06 - 9:10)
because the folks there want a Wii like (9:08 - 9:13)
do you have any in stock like Nintendo (9:10 - 9:16)
did such a good job getting an audience (9:13 - 9:19)
who never cared about video games to now (9:16 - 9:20)
care about video games does that mean (9:19 - 9:22)
that Nintendo doesn't make games for (9:20 - 9:23)
kids anymore no of course they make (9:22 - 9:25)
games for kids but they make games for (9:23 - 9:27)
adults they make games for for older (9:25 - 9:27)
people (9:27 - 9:30)
Pokemon is the same way you can say well (9:27 - 9:33)
the TV show is for kids yeah sure but (9:30 - 9:34)
that doesn't mean the video games are (9:33 - 9:37)
for kids that doesn't mean the the the (9:34 - 9:39)
the 500 watch they just released with (9:37 - 9:42)
Gengar and it is for kids like no like (9:39 - 9:45)
they are making things for everyone but (9:42 - 9:47)
going back to me falling in love with (9:45 - 9:50)
the TV show as a 10 year old and then (9:47 - 9:52)
wanting the games for Christmas at no (9:50 - 9:53)
point (9:52 - 9:57)
as a kid did I ever go I want to save (9:53 - 9:59)
the world no the thing they put in my (9:57 - 10:01)
imagination the thing I wanted to be was (9:59 - 10:04)
a Pokemon trainer I wanted to explore (10:01 - 10:07)
the world catch Pokemon and be the like (10:04 - 10:09)
the the quote of be the very best right (10:07 - 10:11)
like I wanted to be a Pokemon Master (10:09 - 10:14)
like none of what I signed up for was to (10:11 - 10:17)
save the world which I think those (10:14 - 10:19)
middle games all right well I mean (10:17 - 10:22)
technically this game too we're all (10:19 - 10:24)
save the world no I just want to be a (10:22 - 10:25)
Pokemon trainer I just want to catch (10:24 - 10:28)
Pokemon in battle I don't care about (10:25 - 10:30)
your flower cannon that's going to (10:28 - 10:31)
explode the world that's not what I (10:30 - 10:34)
signed up for but to be fair that is (10:31 - 10:37)
what I signed up for (10:34 - 10:37)
no because as (10:43 - 10:47)
gen 1 was a great game (10:47 - 10:52)
but (10:50 - 10:54)
the plot line was nothing and as an (10:52 - 10:57)
older consumer and as as as a person (10:54 - 11:01)
that plays RPGs I am playing for an (10:57 - 11:03)
interesting story and for an interesting (11:01 - 11:05)
world and when the plot line is just (11:03 - 11:06)
you're wandering around a region (11:05 - 11:10)
collecting things because I'm bored (11:06 - 11:14)
so yeah I do want to save the world I (11:10 - 11:15)
want an interesting story I want (11:14 - 11:17)
interesting characters who do (11:15 - 11:18)
interesting things in an interesting (11:17 - 11:22)
world I don't I live an interesting life (11:18 - 11:25)
I want to escape somewhere that I can do (11:22 - 11:28)
a lot more than I can do here (11:25 - 11:31)
so I don't hate stories that let me save (11:28 - 11:34)
the world I don't hate stories although (11:31 - 11:37)
they ain't great at the answers they (11:34 - 11:40)
give and I could talk at length about (11:37 - 11:42)
why their stories ultimately fail (11:40 - 11:44)
because they ask questions bigger than (11:42 - 11:48)
they can answer but if every game was me (11:44 - 11:51)
just wandering around doing the same (11:48 - 11:54)
thing I would have left the series long (11:51 - 11:55)
ago (11:54 - 11:58)
I think they accomplished what they (11:55 - 11:59)
wanted to hear though with you know (11:58 - 12:02)
telling good stories that don't revolve (11:59 - 12:04)
around saving the world like when I (12:02 - 12:07)
picked up bravely default 2 or the first (12:04 - 12:09)
Bravely Default even like I knew what (12:07 - 12:11)
the I knew I knew what I was buying I (12:09 - 12:12)
was buying a game that will like (12:11 - 12:15)
somebody's in terror you're you're the (12:12 - 12:17)
special hero this world is falling apart (12:15 - 12:19)
you gotta save it here's a brag tag team (12:17 - 12:21)
of eight different people you can switch (12:19 - 12:23)
them out like (12:21 - 12:26)
sometimes I want that experience (12:23 - 12:28)
um I never wanted that experience in (12:26 - 12:30)
Pokemon but like (12:28 - 12:32)
and this is this is the thing about (12:30 - 12:35)
black and white where like I I don't (12:32 - 12:38)
think that story is particularly good (12:35 - 12:43)
but I think the world they built was (12:38 - 12:47)
fantastic and the lore and the towns and (12:43 - 12:49)
the reason of the drag like kirim in (12:47 - 12:51)
Russia Ramen like all of that stuff is (12:49 - 12:56)
so interesting and so well structured (12:51 - 12:59)
and that in itself makes you want to (12:56 - 13:01)
explore and be in that world and then it (12:59 - 13:02)
was like oh yeah this little boy in the (13:01 - 13:04)
ferris wheel is like being manipulated (13:02 - 13:07)
by his weird not bad but Dad kind of guy (13:04 - 13:08)
and like (13:07 - 13:11)
oh like yeah here I guess we gotta save (13:08 - 13:13)
the boy and save the world that's not (13:11 - 13:15)
why I'm here though like I would just (13:13 - 13:17)
love to know more about this gym leader (13:15 - 13:20)
and like why like I (13:17 - 13:22)
and that's why I connected so much with (13:20 - 13:25)
these games is I just felt so refreshing (13:22 - 13:27)
it like like there's something about (13:25 - 13:29)
walking through a world and knowing that (13:27 - 13:33)
like there's like why why is this very (13:29 - 13:35)
tall dude locked up in a prison and why (13:33 - 13:37)
is there a flower cannon aiming for the (13:35 - 13:40)
sky and it's like you gotta you gotta do (13:37 - 13:41)
these things and it's like I got two (13:40 - 13:44)
more Badges and 400 more Pokemon to (13:41 - 13:45)
catch like (13:44 - 13:47)
I I don't want that pressure I don't (13:45 - 13:49)
care and like there's nothing you're (13:47 - 13:51)
going to suddenly say or do to make me (13:49 - 13:53)
drop what I want to do to like go shut (13:51 - 13:56)
down the cannon I'll get there it's fine (13:53 - 13:58)
everyone in that town can suffer with no (13:56 - 14:00)
Plumbing for the next month because I'm (13:58 - 14:02)
catching Pokemon like (14:00 - 14:04)
because I think that's the thing that (14:02 - 14:07)
that I I like about the the open world (14:04 - 14:09)
aspect of this game is like you can you (14:07 - 14:11)
know I think we we discussed that before (14:09 - 14:14)
like you can you can go and catch like (14:11 - 14:15)
do what I'm doing just now which is just (14:14 - 14:17)
catching all the Pokemon I've not done (14:15 - 14:18)
it in my second playthrough I've not (14:17 - 14:20)
done a single gym I've not done a single (14:18 - 14:22)
Titan I'm just catching as many Pokemon (14:20 - 14:24)
as I can before I have to do any of (14:22 - 14:26)
those and I I like the flexibility of (14:24 - 14:27)
that (14:26 - 14:29)
um because you know we've talked before (14:27 - 14:32)
about how Pokemon games are like they (14:29 - 14:35)
talk about the idea of lots of different (14:32 - 14:37)
ways of of having Pokemon and they've (14:35 - 14:41)
tried to do things in like they had the (14:37 - 14:43)
the beauty contests and they had like (14:41 - 14:46)
the poffin stuff and like they've had (14:43 - 14:47)
other bits and pieces but ultimately to (14:46 - 14:50)
play the vast majority of the game you (14:47 - 14:52)
still have to battle (14:50 - 14:54)
what is this game sure to play all of (14:52 - 14:56)
the game you have to battle but you can (14:54 - 14:59)
play most of this game without battling (14:56 - 15:03)
basically at all (14:59 - 15:03)
you have the least amount of battles of (15:04 - 15:10)
any Pokemon game if you choose to do so (15:07 - 15:12)
yeah you you could get through it just (15:10 - 15:15)
doing the Milestone by I don't know it's (15:12 - 15:18)
called them the key battles the eight (15:15 - 15:20)
gems the four Elite Four the Titans team (15:18 - 15:22)
star and that's (15:20 - 15:24)
not a lot of battles compared to old (15:22 - 15:26)
Pokemon games where it's like every (15:24 - 15:27)
route has (15:26 - 15:29)
five to eight trainers and you only have (15:27 - 15:31)
to do those battles if you actually want (15:29 - 15:33)
to complete the game which you might not (15:31 - 15:34)
want to not I mean most people don't (15:33 - 15:36)
complete games (15:34 - 15:38)
I know that seems like a weird idea no (15:36 - 15:40)
no that's I find a weird idea as well (15:38 - 15:42)
but like people do that apparently (15:40 - 15:46)
yeah they're I mean like if you go on to (15:42 - 15:47)
the PlayStation and you like look at (15:46 - 15:50)
like game completion buy trophies right (15:47 - 15:51)
like as long as your PlayStation is (15:50 - 15:53)
connected to the internet it will show (15:51 - 15:55)
you who's completed what and like a (15:53 - 15:57)
thing that I that always stood out to me (15:55 - 16:00)
for like Destiny was like (15:57 - 16:03)
50 of the people didn't even like finish (16:00 - 16:05)
the first (16:03 - 16:08)
like World in Destiny like (16:05 - 16:10)
oh like all these people bought the game (16:08 - 16:12)
but over half of them didn't even finish (16:10 - 16:15)
like the first huge story beat which I (16:12 - 16:17)
mean happens like I I'm sure people (16:15 - 16:19)
listening have 400 games they bought on (16:17 - 16:21)
a steam sale and they have they've (16:19 - 16:24)
opened maybe five of the 400 like it (16:21 - 16:27)
happens I get it people get busy (16:24 - 16:28)
um and there's a lot of games out there (16:27 - 16:31)
uh and games are cheaper than ever and (16:28 - 16:33)
there's a lot of free games and this is (16:31 - 16:35)
why Pokemon games have had to change (16:33 - 16:39)
over the years uh is like you have so (16:35 - 16:41)
much to compete with uh either free or (16:39 - 16:44)
discounted or just the mass amount of (16:41 - 16:45)
games that come out (16:44 - 16:48)
um and I I think they did I mean I think (16:45 - 16:51)
they did a really great job with the (16:48 - 16:53)
huge asterisks of I wish the game ran (16:51 - 16:55)
better I wish the you know you didn't (16:53 - 16:57)
fall through the floor I wish but you (16:55 - 16:58)
know Great Balls didn't appear in every (16:57 - 17:00)
doorway right like besides the issues I (16:58 - 17:01)
think they made something really special (17:00 - 17:03)
here and they (17:01 - 17:05)
I I think a lot of good choices were (17:03 - 17:07)
made but (17:05 - 17:11)
for a series that has kind of fumbled (17:07 - 17:15)
the story time and time again uh (17:11 - 17:17)
I don't think the story was perfect but (17:15 - 17:20)
like I enjoyed each (17:17 - 17:22)
of one enough to be like I want to see (17:20 - 17:23)
this through (17:22 - 17:24)
uh to the point where like I wanted I (17:23 - 17:26)
want to just see it through not to like (17:24 - 17:27)
get it out of the way or get it done (17:26 - 17:29)
with like I wanted to see what happened (17:27 - 17:31)
to the dog I wanted I wanted to see who (17:29 - 17:34)
the final boss was right like uh and I (17:31 - 17:38)
enjoyed I I think they to me they nailed (17:34 - 17:39)
those endings to a point where I was (17:38 - 17:41)
like yeah that makes sense like dog lift (17:39 - 17:42)
cool (17:41 - 17:47)
they to me my issue with it again and it (17:42 - 17:49)
held up for area zero (17:47 - 17:52)
is everything was really predictable (17:49 - 17:54)
uh there wasn't a single time in this (17:52 - 17:56)
entire series that I was (17:54 - 18:00)
completely shocked or oh I can't believe (17:56 - 18:05)
they did that I it it it it felt to me (18:00 - 18:08)
very paint by numbers and I will say (18:05 - 18:12)
towards the end of each storyline I was (18:08 - 18:14)
just doing them to get them done (18:12 - 18:16)
because I'm like I know how this is (18:14 - 18:17)
going to end (18:16 - 18:22)
I I just now want to get to the ending (18:17 - 18:22)
so you you say there was no are you (18:22 - 18:26)
you're including areas either in this (18:24 - 18:28)
correct so you so you weren't shocked by (18:26 - 18:30)
the fact they actually killed someone in (18:28 - 18:32)
this game no not like I know we've I (18:30 - 18:33)
know we joke about the fact that they've (18:32 - 18:34)
been doing that in trailers and stuff (18:33 - 18:37)
yeah this is the first person who's (18:34 - 18:39)
actually died and they've explicitly (18:37 - 18:42)
said has died in a Pokemon game I mean (18:39 - 18:44)
that shocked me like I am honestly I (18:42 - 18:46)
agree I'm still surprised they did that (18:44 - 18:50)
mm-hmm wow (18:46 - 18:53)
the minute we stepped into area zero and (18:50 - 18:56)
we got the first message I went (18:53 - 18:58)
oh he's dead (18:56 - 19:00)
well I mean I knew there was something (18:58 - 19:03)
weird right and and but I mean you don't (19:00 - 19:06)
have to be shocked at the reveal but (19:03 - 19:08)
like when you first realized you weren't (19:06 - 19:11)
shocked at that point (19:08 - 19:15)
no because at that point with arvin's (19:11 - 19:17)
storyline the way it was and the way (19:15 - 19:19)
that they had heavily leaned into his (19:17 - 19:23)
loss storyline that I figured okay or (19:19 - 19:24)
they're not killing the dog because that (19:23 - 19:27)
doesn't plot line make sense (19:24 - 19:31)
it has to be his parent because that is (19:27 - 19:33)
I mean like I didn't think that at all (19:31 - 19:35)
oh I did immediately yeah (19:33 - 19:36)
um and so (19:35 - 19:39)
they have they have hinted and never (19:36 - 19:41)
explicitly stated but they have hinted (19:39 - 19:43)
about the terrible fate of your parents (19:41 - 19:45)
in a lot of games (19:43 - 19:46)
and the terrible fate of a lot of people (19:45 - 19:51)
and I thought I I knew going into areas (19:46 - 19:54)
era I'm like since they have made all of (19:51 - 19:56)
these plot lines very human and very (19:54 - 19:58)
personal there is (19:56 - 20:01)
one of two options either (19:58 - 20:03)
they're trapped in time and can never (20:01 - 20:05)
return (20:03 - 20:07)
but most likely (20:05 - 20:09)
they're dead (20:07 - 20:13)
and the most likely one was reality (20:09 - 20:14)
um so again it's not that it wasn't (20:13 - 20:16)
effective (20:14 - 20:20)
but to me as a person that has washed a (20:16 - 20:23)
lot of these stories and got all of the (20:20 - 20:26)
clues like they telegraphed a lot of (20:23 - 20:28)
these things so far in advance that when (20:26 - 20:31)
I got there it made sense (20:28 - 20:34)
but wasn't like I was like oh wow like I (20:31 - 20:36)
went oh okay that yeah that fits with (20:34 - 20:37)
what you were telling me this entire (20:36 - 20:38)
time (20:37 - 20:41)
I'm sure like everything is like easier (20:38 - 20:44)
in hindsight but like even even the even (20:41 - 20:46)
various episodes of the show we talked (20:44 - 20:48)
about the professor and we talked about (20:46 - 20:50)
how maybe uh the schools were going to (20:48 - 20:52)
be pitted against each other like they (20:50 - 20:55)
did nothing in the promotion of this to (20:52 - 20:58)
make it seem like yeah one that you were (20:55 - 21:00)
like after like 20 hours in I'm like (20:58 - 21:02)
where's the professor we haven't met (21:00 - 21:04)
them yet (21:02 - 21:07)
um and then like 40 hours in like oh I'm (21:04 - 21:09)
about to beat the game haven't met the (21:07 - 21:12)
professor like that was a bold choice (21:09 - 21:14)
that they made I'm not saying it's not a (21:12 - 21:17)
bold Choice that's not surprising to me (21:14 - 21:18)
and (21:17 - 21:22)
so the per the professor not being there (21:18 - 21:26)
um and they were they were able to (21:22 - 21:26)
uh I don't know like I I never thought (21:26 - 21:32)
the professor was going to be like dead (21:30 - 21:34)
and I I think I said out of my Nintendo (21:32 - 21:37)
preview like I walked away feeling like (21:34 - 21:39)
oh this this uh Future Past thing (21:37 - 21:42)
doesn't seem to be like a big play you (21:39 - 21:44)
know there were there were speculations (21:42 - 21:46)
that like team star like half of Team (21:44 - 21:47)
star is going to be in the past half a (21:46 - 21:49)
team Stars gonna be in the future or (21:47 - 21:50)
this Pokemon's only gonna evolve in the (21:49 - 21:52)
past this one's gonna like there's (21:50 - 21:56)
really not like uh like obviously the (21:52 - 21:58)
the eight Pokemon from each nine Pokemon (21:56 - 22:00)
from each game like these are from the (21:58 - 22:02)
past these are from the future yeah like (22:00 - 22:04)
you're you're not going into the past of (22:02 - 22:06)
the future you're not controlling (22:04 - 22:08)
anything like it is they save it to the (22:06 - 22:11)
end yeah and it's like not that dramatic (22:08 - 22:14)
um but when when I got into area zero (22:11 - 22:17)
and the the intercom thing started (22:14 - 22:19)
messing up I was like oh there must be (22:17 - 22:20)
two professors there must be like a real (22:19 - 22:23)
one and like a robot one and maybe the (22:20 - 22:25)
real ones can't talk because the robot (22:23 - 22:27)
one like I think for me the the thought (22:25 - 22:30)
process was like oh the robot one is (22:27 - 22:32)
like holding him hostage or yeah that's (22:30 - 22:34)
what I thought as well or what Greg (22:32 - 22:36)
thing I've said is like oh the professor (22:34 - 22:38)
is stuck in the past in the future and (22:36 - 22:40)
once I hit a bunch of buttons it's gonna (22:38 - 22:43)
zap them back to reality (22:40 - 22:48)
I did think it was shocking that you (22:43 - 22:50)
have this dog that's almost about to die (22:48 - 22:53)
and Arvin is a hot mess throughout that (22:50 - 22:56)
story and you finally get that sense of (22:53 - 22:58)
relief that his dog is now alive right (22:56 - 23:01)
feels good it was a feel-good moment for (22:58 - 23:02)
me to be like yeah your dog's alive cool (23:01 - 23:04)
now I gotta battle your dog (23:02 - 23:06)
um (23:04 - 23:08)
and you almost have like a happy ending (23:06 - 23:10)
for Arvin and then he gets down there (23:08 - 23:12)
and then (23:10 - 23:14)
like you have to do all of this with him (23:12 - 23:17)
being like Oh I just learned that my (23:14 - 23:18)
parents did like (23:17 - 23:21)
I did not I I a million percent agree (23:18 - 23:22)
with Al I did not think they would do (23:21 - 23:25)
that in a Pokemon game oh (23:22 - 23:25)
and for all the people that are like (23:25 - 23:28)
Pokemon games are for kids Pokemon games (23:27 - 23:31)
are for kids like one you you clearly (23:28 - 23:33)
didn't understand sun and moon story (23:31 - 23:35)
because I don't know clearly because if (23:33 - 23:38)
you're an adult sitting here being like (23:35 - 23:39)
Pokemon games are for kids you don't (23:38 - 23:41)
understand verbal abuse then as an adult (23:39 - 23:43)
and you should probably maybe I don't (23:41 - 23:44)
know take five seconds to understand (23:43 - 23:48)
that like like like like no kid playing (23:44 - 23:50)
Sun and Moon (23:48 - 23:53)
can comprehend that storyline to its (23:50 - 23:56)
fullest they might relate to it of like (23:53 - 23:58)
oh my mom tells me what I should wear (23:56 - 24:00)
and I dislike that and it's nice to see (23:58 - 24:01)
that like (24:00 - 24:03)
I have similar feelings to that sun and (24:01 - 24:05)
moon also was a great way to plant the (24:03 - 24:08)
seeds like (24:05 - 24:10)
your parents might not be good people (24:08 - 24:13)
yeah totally (24:10 - 24:15)
um think about therapy when you are out (24:13 - 24:19)
of the house I couldn't I could never (24:15 - 24:24)
put myself in somebody's shoes as like a (24:19 - 24:28)
kid having divorced parents or losing a (24:24 - 24:30)
parent or losing a sibling I just cannot (24:28 - 24:32)
imagine what that feels like (24:30 - 24:35)
I just can't and I wish I could (24:32 - 24:38)
um like you know I I've seen so many of (24:35 - 24:41)
my friends have like their pets die or (24:38 - 24:44)
lose somebody and I I just I I didn't (24:41 - 24:48)
have empathy I just didn't know what to (24:44 - 24:50)
ever say to those people because I never (24:48 - 24:52)
had it happen like I just I just never (24:50 - 24:54)
had that experience (24:52 - 24:56)
and like like you know when somebody (24:54 - 24:59)
comes to my stream or when a friend of (24:56 - 25:00)
mine or something like oh my dog died (24:59 - 25:03)
and it's like man that really sucks and (25:00 - 25:06)
then I like none of that hit me until (25:03 - 25:08)
like I lost my own cat right (25:06 - 25:11)
and like nothing can prepare you for (25:08 - 25:12)
that (25:11 - 25:13)
so like (25:12 - 25:15)
I think about (25:13 - 25:18)
a seven-year-old or a 15 year old or a (25:15 - 25:20)
20 year old who like lost their parent (25:18 - 25:22)
like I don't know how they feel when (25:20 - 25:24)
they play this game and maybe for some (25:22 - 25:25)
of them (25:24 - 25:26)
doesn't matter (25:25 - 25:29)
but I I think that (25:26 - 25:33)
that can be super impactful and I I (25:29 - 25:35)
applaud Pokemon even though they're not (25:33 - 25:37)
even though they're not the best at (25:35 - 25:39)
storytelling I applaud them for trying (25:37 - 25:41)
yeah I think I think it is a really (25:39 - 25:45)
I I was impressed I give them credit for (25:41 - 25:48)
making a good personal story that is not (25:45 - 25:51)
my complaint it was a good personal (25:48 - 25:52)
story (25:51 - 25:54)
for me (25:52 - 25:57)
it was a straight line story I predicted (25:54 - 26:01)
it from beginning to end that is not (25:57 - 26:04)
that doesn't qualify in my universe as a (26:01 - 26:07)
top tier story I like stories that I'm (26:04 - 26:10)
like how are we here how did we even get (26:07 - 26:13)
here and unfortunately (26:10 - 26:16)
despite it being a good story (26:13 - 26:19)
it was a very predictable story to me (26:16 - 26:23)
that I I not once was like I can't (26:19 - 26:25)
believe we're here (26:23 - 26:28)
I how did we even get here how are we (26:25 - 26:30)
here at this point in the game what's (26:28 - 26:31)
coming next I don't know what's (26:30 - 26:35)
happening I knew what was happening very (26:31 - 26:38)
early on that's not to say they aren't (26:35 - 26:40)
good and they are better because I have (26:38 - 26:42)
said A Thousand Times They Are Better (26:40 - 26:44)
stories because they're very personal (26:42 - 26:47)
and very human and they need to keep (26:44 - 26:49)
doing that (26:47 - 26:52)
but they didn't surprise me they didn't (26:49 - 26:55)
shock me they didn't it wasn't a twist (26:52 - 26:57)
their Larry was all the surprise you (26:55 - 26:59)
needed Greg yeah take Larry yeah and be (26:57 - 27:02)
happy Larry it's Larry Larry made the (26:59 - 27:04)
game for me really I was like yes you (27:02 - 27:06)
are 100 why I love this game (27:04 - 27:11)
um but that is again me not connecting (27:06 - 27:13)
with these stories because I felt they (27:11 - 27:16)
were very shallow is me and my (27:13 - 27:18)
experiences right like (27:16 - 27:22)
I'm 52 and I will tell you (27:18 - 27:26)
for you get used to grief because grief (27:22 - 27:29)
never ends like I have had a major (27:26 - 27:32)
person die in my life for eight years (27:29 - 27:37)
now and you just sort of understand as (27:32 - 27:40)
you get older how life how your life (27:37 - 27:43)
starts to work you start having to say (27:40 - 27:45)
goodbye to people (27:43 - 27:46)
and you start living your life (27:45 - 27:50)
differently because you you are just now (27:46 - 27:53)
constantly living in some form of grief (27:50 - 27:56)
and it's fine (27:53 - 27:58)
that is not to say that they shouldn't (27:56 - 28:00)
show this to a different audience like (27:58 - 28:02)
you all have a different experience with (28:00 - 28:04)
it and that's great I have a very (28:02 - 28:06)
different experience with it because of (28:04 - 28:09)
who I am who I lived what I consume is (28:06 - 28:12)
for entertainment and the fact that I (28:09 - 28:14)
like people are still shocked that Brit (28:12 - 28:17)
and I predicted the ending of The Sixth (28:14 - 28:19)
Sense within the first 10 minutes of the (28:17 - 28:20)
movie (28:19 - 28:23)
like we knew how that movie was going to (28:20 - 28:25)
end the same way I knew how this game (28:23 - 28:28)
was going to end because of my (28:25 - 28:31)
what I seek out in stories and what I've (28:28 - 28:33)
lived is my life that doesn't make them (28:31 - 28:36)
bad stories they are less impressive to (28:33 - 28:37)
me (28:36 - 28:39)
I want them to continue making these (28:37 - 28:41)
human stories I think they are way (28:39 - 28:44)
better but I will not go on I can't say (28:41 - 28:46)
that I was like oh I can't believe this (28:44 - 28:47)
is what they (28:46 - 28:49)
did totally believed that's what they (28:47 - 28:53)
did I knew it very early on in the games (28:49 - 28:55)
speaking of the the the the personal I (28:53 - 28:57)
really liked an area zero as you were (28:55 - 29:00)
walking down how you see the (28:57 - 29:01)
conversations between the other three (29:00 - 29:04)
just like naturally as you're walking (29:01 - 29:06)
and it's not I think they should do more (29:04 - 29:08)
of that in the future but it's not like (29:06 - 29:11)
take you away from gameplay show you (29:08 - 29:14)
conversation it's like integrated into (29:11 - 29:16)
that I really like them they finally (29:14 - 29:18)
caught up with games from 10 years ago (29:16 - 29:21)
where most games do the walking and (29:18 - 29:24)
talking you know the actual the actual (29:21 - 29:26)
word thing was really fun as well sorry (29:24 - 29:27)
yeah (29:26 - 29:29)
um the only this is a very minor (29:27 - 29:31)
complaint but if you had your Tech speed (29:29 - 29:35)
set to fast yeah and you did that area (29:31 - 29:38)
Zero part the text did actually go (29:35 - 29:41)
faster than it may have for some people (29:38 - 29:43)
I mean you can go into the settings and (29:41 - 29:44)
change that but like (29:43 - 29:45)
um you know if some people were like oh (29:44 - 29:47)
it's going too fast I couldn't keep up (29:45 - 29:49)
it's you had to like (29:47 - 29:51)
obviously the game doesn't like tell you (29:49 - 29:53)
that of like why is it going so fast (29:51 - 29:55)
it's because your Tech speed was set too (29:53 - 29:59)
fast uh just to finish Greg's Point like (29:55 - 30:01)
I I have never really had like a a (29:59 - 30:03)
problem with (30:01 - 30:06)
the surprise Factor (30:03 - 30:08)
um or whatnot maybe that's that's not (30:06 - 30:11)
the right word but like (30:08 - 30:13)
predictability maybe is a better word (30:11 - 30:16)
um like I didn't put two and two (30:13 - 30:17)
together that gladion and Lily were (30:16 - 30:19)
brother and sister and that was like a (30:17 - 30:21)
shock for a lot of people right but like (30:19 - 30:23)
that shock didn't change the like it (30:21 - 30:25)
didn't make the story better (30:23 - 30:27)
um so like I think Pokemon games in the (30:25 - 30:28)
past have done shocks for the sake of (30:27 - 30:33)
doing shocks like like whoa like I I do (30:28 - 30:34)
remember as a kid like Giovanni being (30:33 - 30:38)
the eighth gym leader was was a shock (30:34 - 30:40)
um but it it fit into that story like he (30:38 - 30:43)
he was never there like you didn't know (30:40 - 30:46)
like if it fit naturally in that story (30:43 - 30:48)
and there's a lot of (30:46 - 30:50)
you know through Gen 2 to you know gen (30:48 - 30:53)
seven there are twists and turns that (30:50 - 30:54)
are like oh (30:53 - 30:58)
okay I I mean I didn't know that I don't (30:54 - 30:59)
think it changes the way I feel about (30:58 - 31:01)
this (30:59 - 31:03)
um like even though (31:01 - 31:06)
I think almost everyone knew the dog (31:03 - 31:08)
wasn't going to die (31:06 - 31:10)
I still enjoyed it right like yeah like (31:08 - 31:12)
like if I I guess I would have been (31:10 - 31:15)
shocked if they let the dog die I would (31:12 - 31:17)
have I would have (31:15 - 31:20)
been surprised beyond belief and again (31:17 - 31:23)
um but I I was I was shocked that the (31:20 - 31:25)
professor was dead I really genuinely (31:23 - 31:27)
thought that like robot Professor was (31:25 - 31:29)
holding them hostage or Professor was (31:27 - 31:33)
stuck in a different time zone so like (31:29 - 31:36)
to be to drag Arvin with you after his (31:33 - 31:38)
dog almost died and then be like oh by (31:36 - 31:40)
the way you're you're you're finding out (31:38 - 31:42)
the same time I'm finding out that your (31:40 - 31:46)
dad is dead uh was was a bit like huh oh (31:42 - 31:49)
that's pretty like oh okay uh not the (31:46 - 31:50)
story I would have expected but I'm here (31:49 - 31:53)
for it kind of thing like I liked it (31:50 - 31:56)
um you know I'm not I I wish also that (31:53 - 31:57)
it (31:56 - 32:00)
the head is short they got a short (31:57 - 32:02)
Change arvin's processing time on that (32:00 - 32:05)
one too like yeah like you've got to (32:02 - 32:08)
process a lot really fast here you okay (32:05 - 32:09)
see we're fine we're just gonna go up (32:08 - 32:10)
and then immediately you're like I'm (32:09 - 32:12)
gonna go back to catching and let's run (32:10 - 32:14)
along I'm like like dude you just found (32:12 - 32:16)
out your dad died (32:14 - 32:18)
10 minutes ago do you maybe want to like (32:16 - 32:21)
take a moment maybe hug your dog no you (32:18 - 32:23)
didn't care about it cool (32:21 - 32:27)
kind of explained it okay with (32:23 - 32:31)
he him sang and I I think I could relate (32:27 - 32:33)
to this him saying that um (32:31 - 32:36)
it didn't sink in until the robot (32:33 - 32:38)
version said like I love you or whatever (32:36 - 32:40)
right (32:38 - 32:42)
um and I was like oh that's like (32:40 - 32:44)
that's like pretty powerful I think (32:42 - 32:47)
um and I think I think I relate to that (32:44 - 32:50)
um to give my own personal take is like (32:47 - 32:53)
I feel like (32:50 - 32:56)
how I relate to that is is like texting (32:53 - 32:58)
when you're like texting somebody a (32:56 - 33:01)
bunch of stuff versus (32:58 - 33:04)
hearing it in person and so I feel like (33:01 - 33:07)
it didn't affect him until he heard the (33:04 - 33:09)
robot say it and he even acknowledges (33:07 - 33:11)
like I know it wasn't but like hearing (33:09 - 33:14)
that effectively I mean they give (33:11 - 33:17)
a little time to Urban grieving but then (33:14 - 33:19)
it's they're pretty much you're running (33:17 - 33:21)
up and then it's like let's continue our (33:19 - 33:23)
Journeys together and I'm like yeah (33:21 - 33:27)
I mean just take a an actual moment to (33:23 - 33:29)
process what just happened because we (33:27 - 33:31)
are not doing that at all (33:29 - 33:33)
yeah it's not I don't think it's odd (33:31 - 33:35)
that it wouldn't happen till after (33:33 - 33:36)
that's finished because like you know (33:35 - 33:38)
grief hits people differently like when (33:36 - 33:41)
my when my nana died last year I I (33:38 - 33:42)
didn't process at all until the funeral (33:41 - 33:45)
yeah like I knew it you know I knew (33:42 - 33:48)
obviously she's dead but like you didn't (33:45 - 33:50)
actually have that moment until you're (33:48 - 33:52)
sitting in a room with a bunch of people (33:50 - 33:54)
talking about her yeah that's the point (33:52 - 33:56)
where you go oh wait yeah she's actually (33:54 - 33:59)
gone yeah yeah you know until I totally (33:56 - 34:01)
understand especially when there's like (33:59 - 34:04)
we currently need to stop this situation (34:01 - 34:06)
we don't have time for that like that's (34:04 - 34:09)
quite a common thing yeah it's a kind of (34:06 - 34:11)
thing I just there's I have not run into (34:09 - 34:14)
a thing after that common thing where (34:11 - 34:16)
I'm having any sort of continuation with (34:14 - 34:17)
Arvin about how he's doing that's fair (34:16 - 34:20)
if it's in the game I haven't found it I (34:17 - 34:22)
know we're talking about area zero I (34:20 - 34:23)
believe (34:22 - 34:25)
like I I think one of our YouTube (34:23 - 34:28)
comments and for the record I I think (34:25 - 34:29)
there was a lot of insightful stuff in (34:28 - 34:31)
the YouTube comments in the slack and in (34:29 - 34:32)
the Discord (34:31 - 34:35)
um and I I do read everything the only (34:32 - 34:36)
thing that gets deleted is like personal (34:35 - 34:40)
attacks Like You can disagree with me or (34:36 - 34:44)
Greg totally okay uh but like any I I (34:40 - 34:47)
obviously no tolerate tolerance for you (34:44 - 34:48)
know (34:47 - 34:50)
Steve's hairline is bad (34:48 - 34:53)
um but like (34:50 - 34:57)
I know with like nimona you can be like (34:53 - 34:59)
oh she's a straight line there is a lot (34:57 - 35:00)
that you could seek out in like the (34:59 - 35:03)
libraries or finding her that you know (35:00 - 35:05)
gives you more insight for her which I (35:03 - 35:07)
didn't do I would like to do that I (35:05 - 35:09)
think with Arvin there is some (35:07 - 35:10)
processing (35:09 - 35:13)
before and after the tournament (35:10 - 35:15)
um that if if you wanted that a little (35:13 - 35:16)
bit more for Arvin I think I haven't I (35:15 - 35:18)
think I haven't done that yet (35:16 - 35:21)
um I would like to see it some more (35:18 - 35:25)
um simply because it's it's hard to (35:21 - 35:25)
I think it's frustrating to introduce a (35:26 - 35:32)
grief plotline without sort of talking (35:29 - 35:33)
about (35:32 - 35:35)
to an audience who may not have (35:33 - 35:38)
experienced it what you do with a grief (35:35 - 35:41)
plotline like how do you how what do you (35:38 - 35:44)
do when somebody comes and says my dog (35:41 - 35:45)
died (35:44 - 35:47)
I mean like like I said earlier I didn't (35:45 - 35:49)
know what to do for the longest time so (35:47 - 35:51)
so the game introduces these themes it (35:49 - 35:55)
is it is my desire for them to also (35:51 - 35:57)
model good behavior so that people can (35:55 - 36:00)
learn from those games like to model (35:57 - 36:01)
that (36:00 - 36:04)
you you you do take a moment after (36:01 - 36:07)
arvin's dad has that too like (36:04 - 36:10)
check in with them console them do (36:07 - 36:12)
something to like not just leave them (36:10 - 36:15)
hanging because in a lot of ways it felt (36:12 - 36:18)
it felt a little bit like yeah there was (36:15 - 36:19)
something more important going on so (36:18 - 36:22)
your feelings right now aren't going to (36:19 - 36:23)
be centered and we'll get back to it (36:22 - 36:26)
when we get back to it which isn't like (36:23 - 36:29)
a great modeling thing for me uh of how (36:26 - 36:32)
to deal with somebody who's based a (36:29 - 36:35)
profound loss I mean one could argue (36:32 - 36:38)
since Arvin had not wanted to deal with (36:35 - 36:39)
his death there may not even be anything (36:38 - 36:42)
there which is also a very good topic to (36:39 - 36:44)
have like people who are estranged from (36:42 - 36:46)
their parents often don't know how to (36:44 - 36:50)
feel when one of them dies like I have a (36:46 - 36:52)
relationship with them but I I'm not (36:50 - 36:55)
feeling anything right now and those (36:52 - 36:58)
themes are good to introduce to an (36:55 - 37:00)
audience in some part and I haven't run (36:58 - 37:03)
into it in this game and I I kind of (37:00 - 37:05)
want them if you're going to approach (37:03 - 37:08)
the subject also talk about those things (37:05 - 37:11)
to at least model like we know what's (37:08 - 37:13)
good we can talk to a million therapists (37:11 - 37:16)
about what's appropriate but model it (37:13 - 37:18)
for an audience who is going to have to (37:16 - 37:21)
face this so that they can see it (37:18 - 37:23)
somehow instead of what kind of happens (37:21 - 37:27)
in the game is you just blow past it (37:23 - 37:28)
um (37:27 - 37:30)
and I think that does the plotline a (37:28 - 37:32)
little disservice I don't think it (37:30 - 37:35)
discounts the pot line I don't think it (37:32 - 37:37)
makes a plot line worse but I think they (37:35 - 37:39)
could do those things so that we would (37:37 - 37:42)
be having a universal conversation of (37:39 - 37:45)
they knocked that out of the park (37:42 - 37:47)
yeah I don't want to say the bar is so (37:45 - 37:49)
low but when you look at a game (37:47 - 37:51)
storyline like X and Y (37:49 - 37:53)
and you look at a game storyline like (37:51 - 37:56)
this it's just night and day it is or a (37:53 - 37:59)
Pokemon game but right right and like (37:56 - 38:01)
but again if we are only going to (37:59 - 38:03)
measure them off of their own success (38:01 - 38:06)
then we aren't ever going to see vast (38:03 - 38:08)
improvements in the series right like (38:06 - 38:11)
we're gonna talk about you know we (38:08 - 38:12)
compare it to elderly We compare it to (38:11 - 38:14)
Final Fantasy We compare it to a bunch (38:12 - 38:18)
of other things like if we only keep it (38:14 - 38:19)
to what they've done in the past of the (38:18 - 38:22)
series and not what else exists in the (38:19 - 38:24)
universe that is so that does these (38:22 - 38:26)
things better we are just doing a (38:24 - 38:28)
disservice to this series (38:26 - 38:31)
no I I agree that's why we did bring up (38:28 - 38:33)
like Fallout Infamous all those other (38:31 - 38:35)
games as well (38:33 - 38:37)
um (38:35 - 38:40)
I don't I I have personally not come to (38:37 - 38:42)
Pokemon games for stories I think there (38:40 - 38:44)
are some people that do I I don't know (38:42 - 38:46)
if that's like the highest amount of (38:44 - 38:48)
people (38:46 - 38:48)
you can say you come to Pokemon games (38:50 - 38:54)
for stories but like (38:51 - 38:54)
you still have to like poke like you (38:56 - 38:59)
still have to like the gameplay Loop (38:58 - 39:02)
they're doing oh yeah so even even in (38:59 - 39:04)
something like X and Y where the story (39:02 - 39:05)
is (39:04 - 39:09)
abysmal it's bad like the game they made (39:05 - 39:12)
is so fun yeah that you get through it (39:09 - 39:14)
so like (39:12 - 39:15)
but here's the thing here's the example (39:14 - 39:19)
that I always use I hate (39:15 - 39:20)
all (39:19 - 39:22)
first person shooters (39:20 - 39:25)
hate them I hate the gameplay I hate how (39:22 - 39:28)
they run however (39:25 - 39:31)
Bioshock series is one of my all-time (39:28 - 39:33)
favorites and I will play it a million (39:31 - 39:36)
times and the only reason (39:33 - 39:39)
is because of the story they told in (39:36 - 39:40)
that game (39:39 - 39:42)
because I cannot stand first person (39:40 - 39:43)
shooters (39:42 - 39:48)
I hate them and I okay (39:43 - 39:48)
I love first person shooters and I was (39:48 - 39:54)
told Bioshock was good I cannot stand (39:51 - 39:56)
games this is just me because I'm dumb (39:54 - 39:59)
if if a shooter has it where that's why (39:56 - 40:01)
I didn't like Halo 2 by the way where (39:59 - 40:04)
you can dual wield guns and shooting is (40:01 - 40:05)
on the left stick and then shooting is (40:04 - 40:07)
on the sorry the right bumper and then (40:05 - 40:10)
the left bumper I can't do it I just I (40:07 - 40:12)
just can't and in BioShock it's like (40:10 - 40:14)
that right like you have magic on one (40:12 - 40:16)
hand and then your gun on the other and (40:14 - 40:19)
so it's ultimately two guns uh and I (40:16 - 40:22)
didn't care how their story was (40:19 - 40:25)
the actual so we're complete opposite (40:22 - 40:28)
Greg like if the story is amazing for (40:25 - 40:30)
you you'll suffer through gameplay if (40:28 - 40:33)
the gameplay if if the story is amazing (40:30 - 40:35)
for me but the gameplay is bad I just I (40:33 - 40:38)
can't do it yeah like to be fair I'm the (40:35 - 40:40)
same all I did to Bioshock was release (40:38 - 40:42)
bees I don't think I ever used my gun (40:40 - 40:46)
just go go eat eat them alive my bees (40:42 - 40:49)
I'm the same as Steve like I I think if (40:46 - 40:52)
I'm not enjoying playing a game I may as (40:49 - 40:54)
well just be watching a film like I (40:52 - 40:57)
don't why why would I I don't need no (40:54 - 40:59)
I'm not saying that games shouldn't have (40:57 - 41:02)
good stories and I'm absolutely I I like (40:59 - 41:04)
when there's a good story in a game that (41:02 - 41:05)
I'm enjoying playing (41:04 - 41:07)
but that's yeah that's not why I'm (41:05 - 41:09)
playing the game I'm playing the game (41:07 - 41:11)
because I enjoy playing the game and if (41:09 - 41:12)
there's a good story that's that's (41:11 - 41:15)
secondary to that right that's a good (41:12 - 41:17)
story I can go watch something a good (41:15 - 41:18)
story (41:17 - 41:21)
well draw me in every time no matter how (41:18 - 41:23)
bad the gameplay is no because I I get (41:21 - 41:25)
it I just I I just know I'm the opposite (41:23 - 41:27)
because it is very it's a very different (41:25 - 41:31)
experience also for film like (41:27 - 41:33)
like I could also be watching a film but (41:31 - 41:35)
again film hits your brain differently (41:33 - 41:38)
than an interactive thing does and so I (41:35 - 41:41)
like the two mediums like I'll watch a (41:38 - 41:43)
film too from beginning to end but (41:41 - 41:45)
there's an Interactive (41:43 - 41:48)
element of games that make that unique (41:45 - 41:51)
to me which is why I will still do them (41:48 - 41:52)
for the story (41:51 - 41:54)
that that's I yeah that's that's totally (41:52 - 41:58)
fair but but I mean from I suspect (41:54 - 41:59)
Steve's the same on this like if I'm (41:58 - 42:04)
like if the gameplay isn't working with (41:59 - 42:06)
how my brain wants it to work (42:04 - 42:08)
nothing can overcome that right yeah (42:06 - 42:10)
like that is just going to annoy me (42:08 - 42:14)
forever and I and I I can't I can't let (42:10 - 42:16)
anything pass that if that makes sense (42:14 - 42:20)
yeah no that's that's fair and again I (42:16 - 42:23)
like the core gameplay mechanic of (42:20 - 42:24)
Pokemon (42:23 - 42:27)
like yeah it is a good marriage of the (42:24 - 42:30)
things I like doing which is turn-based (42:27 - 42:35)
RPGs and sometimes a good story but (42:30 - 42:37)
Pokemon has always hit a balance in (42:35 - 42:40)
between that that that serves my purpose (42:37 - 42:42)
as well which is why I really like this (42:40 - 42:45)
series yeah I I I've always rated a good (42:42 - 42:46)
story I've said this before I've said (42:45 - 42:48)
this a million times I've always rated a (42:46 - 42:51)
good story in a game to me as somebody (42:48 - 42:53)
who can sit on the couch next to you (42:51 - 42:57)
and be just as engrossed with what (42:53 - 42:59)
they're looking at even though they're (42:57 - 43:01)
not playing right so I think of a game (42:59 - 43:05)
like Uncharted I think of a game like (43:01 - 43:07)
um until dawn although I hated the way (43:05 - 43:09)
that game ended uh I think I think of (43:07 - 43:11)
like something like Metal Gear Solid I (43:09 - 43:12)
think that Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear (43:11 - 43:14)
Solid 2 was that game for a lot of (43:12 - 43:17)
people in the early 2000s of (43:14 - 43:20)
um I want to watch you play it I have no (43:17 - 43:22)
I have no desire to to shoot I have no (43:20 - 43:25)
desire to stealth I have no desire to uh (43:22 - 43:29)
bash the sword button but I want to (43:25 - 43:30)
watch you play it because the story (43:29 - 43:32)
itself is so good and I've always said (43:30 - 43:33)
like there's not a single Pokemon game (43:32 - 43:35)
that that hits that Mark right like no (43:33 - 43:37)
one is sitting on the couch next to you (43:35 - 43:38)
being like man what happens after the (43:37 - 43:40)
ferris wheel scene in black and white (43:38 - 43:42)
like I (43:40 - 43:44)
I mean do people actually do that (43:42 - 43:46)
because like my thing is right like I (43:44 - 43:49)
people I hate watch other people play (43:46 - 43:51)
yeah no no no no no not watch other (43:49 - 43:53)
people no no no no no no no no no no (43:51 - 43:55)
like would somebody actually like watch (43:53 - 43:58)
for this story right like I get watching (43:55 - 44:01)
like I enjoy watching no no just in (43:58 - 44:03)
games in general oh oh yeah like yes I (44:01 - 44:05)
think my thing is that if if a game is (44:03 - 44:07)
going to be engrossing in terms of the (44:05 - 44:08)
story (44:07 - 44:11)
I'm not fine I'm not I don't feel like (44:08 - 44:14)
that is a a game now I'm not saying it's (44:11 - 44:17)
not a game but to me like (44:14 - 44:20)
I don't I don't play games (44:17 - 44:22)
to watch like cut scenes I don't play (44:20 - 44:24)
games to like get that (44:22 - 44:26)
story aspect of things like I'm playing (44:24 - 44:27)
games (44:26 - 44:29)
to do something and sometimes that might (44:27 - 44:31)
be something boring and repetitive like (44:29 - 44:33)
the farming games I play sometimes it (44:31 - 44:34)
might be (44:33 - 44:36)
um you know creature collection like (44:34 - 44:39)
Pokemon there's loads of different types (44:36 - 44:41)
of gameplay but I I mean maybe I'm just (44:39 - 44:44)
maybe this is just a me thing but the (44:41 - 44:45)
idea of like (44:44 - 44:48)
a story being so engrossing that someone (44:45 - 44:50)
sitting next to you would be like I need (44:48 - 44:51)
to know what this is happening next yeah (44:50 - 44:53)
I just feel like the gameplay would be (44:51 - 44:56)
so (44:53 - 44:58)
like Spa I hate when it stops the (44:56 - 45:01)
gameplay is essentially is Where I Come (44:58 - 45:03)
From so I I can give you like two (45:01 - 45:07)
examples number one is like I know a (45:03 - 45:09)
hundred percent that I don't like the (45:07 - 45:12)
gameplay of like a god of war (45:09 - 45:16)
uh and like God of War was huge when it (45:12 - 45:18)
first released like it was a lot of (45:16 - 45:20)
reasons why people wanted a PS2 or a PS3 (45:18 - 45:24)
and uh like I I worked at GameStop at (45:20 - 45:26)
the time I bought a used PS2 literally (45:24 - 45:27)
to play God of War because people (45:26 - 45:28)
wouldn't shut up about it and I just (45:27 - 45:31)
didn't like it I just like it didn't (45:28 - 45:32)
matter how good the story was with god (45:31 - 45:34)
of war and then God of War got (45:32 - 45:37)
re-released on PS4 right that game won a (45:34 - 45:39)
bunch of a game uh game of the years and (45:37 - 45:40)
then the new God of War just came out (45:39 - 45:43)
actually the same day as Pokemon and I (45:40 - 45:45)
watched people play it on Twitch because (45:43 - 45:48)
I just knew no matter how good the story (45:45 - 45:50)
was (45:48 - 45:52)
um that I I couldn't get through the (45:50 - 45:54)
combat I could Crank that down all the (45:52 - 45:56)
way to the easiest just to get through (45:54 - 45:58)
it but I just didn't it was for me it (45:56 - 46:01)
was just easier to to watch and then I (45:58 - 46:04)
think of like I think of The Last of Us (46:01 - 46:06)
which (46:04 - 46:08)
um like Irene would not let me play a (46:06 - 46:11)
second unless she was like like if she (46:08 - 46:12)
went to the bathroom I had to pause (46:11 - 46:15)
like it was it was like and but but she (46:12 - 46:17)
admitted she's like I could never play (46:15 - 46:19)
this game what you are doing in this (46:17 - 46:22)
game even on the easiest difficulty she (46:19 - 46:24)
was like I cannot do that (46:22 - 46:26)
and and some people just know that just (46:24 - 46:27)
like I know we joked about like people (46:26 - 46:29)
not understanding like Terror types and (46:27 - 46:31)
raids and like the the (46:29 - 46:34)
but like the the what what some games (46:31 - 46:37)
are requiring you to do (46:34 - 46:38)
um (46:37 - 46:40)
she she just couldn't do and she just (46:38 - 46:43)
loved every single step of the last of (46:40 - 46:45)
us that she was like on the couch she (46:43 - 46:48)
made popcorn she was very into it like (46:45 - 46:48)
she was looking up characters (46:48 - 46:51)
backstories on her phone as we were (46:48 - 46:53)
playing like she was so into the last of (46:51 - 46:56)
us and she was actually mad at me that I (46:53 - 46:58)
didn't buy last of us too and it wasn't (46:56 - 47:00)
because of any of the it wasn't because (46:58 - 47:02)
of Any like the bad promotion or the (47:00 - 47:03)
good promotion you know people are very (47:02 - 47:06)
mixed on the last of us too it was that (47:03 - 47:09)
I loved the last of us so much it was (47:06 - 47:12)
one of my favorite games ever it was so (47:09 - 47:15)
depressing and I just didn't want to go (47:12 - 47:18)
back to that world like I loved playing (47:15 - 47:21)
it I loved the story absolutely would (47:18 - 47:23)
give that game a 10 out of 10. and I (47:21 - 47:24)
know the last of us too is better in (47:23 - 47:27)
every single way I do not want to step (47:24 - 47:30)
back into that world and have those (47:27 - 47:32)
emotions again I am sure that game is (47:30 - 47:35)
fantastic and maybe one day I'll I'll (47:32 - 47:37)
watch like YouTube cut scenes or maybe (47:35 - 47:39)
somebody on Twitch play it but like (47:37 - 47:41)
Irene was like are we getting last of us (47:39 - 47:44)
too I know I don't want to go back there (47:41 - 47:48)
I just I can't like I that's just me (47:44 - 47:50)
Brent watched me play all of Bioshock (47:48 - 47:52)
right like he would just sit and watch (47:50 - 47:54)
because I thought he hates first person (47:52 - 47:56)
shooters and I was willing to do it (47:54 - 47:58)
and he would just scream bees every time (47:56 - 48:01)
somebody would release bees but yeah (47:58 - 48:02)
like (48:01 - 48:04)
him sitting there watching and the funny (48:02 - 48:06)
thing is is that him watching me play (48:04 - 48:08)
sword and shield (48:06 - 48:10)
made him want to play sword and shield (48:08 - 48:12)
and he bought sword (48:10 - 48:14)
him watching me play scarlet and violet (48:12 - 48:16)
he's like (48:14 - 48:18)
[Laughter] (48:16 - 48:21)
right like that that is that that is do (48:18 - 48:22)
you think he bought sword because of the (48:21 - 48:24)
story though or because the gameplay (48:22 - 48:26)
Loop looked good (48:24 - 48:29)
I don't think it's a story The the I (48:26 - 48:30)
think there was a there are a number of (48:29 - 48:33)
things the world was very vibrant things (48:30 - 48:37)
felt more exciting from the get-go (48:33 - 48:37)
um (48:37 - 48:40)
that like the Pokemon that he saw almost (48:37 - 48:43)
immediately he was like I'm really into (48:40 - 48:44)
um there were a number of reasons why he (48:43 - 48:46)
was like into that game when I started (48:44 - 48:48)
playing it almost immediately that just (48:46 - 48:50)
did not happen in this game at all yeah (48:48 - 48:52)
I I don't think the fact that when he (48:50 - 48:53)
looked up would have headed it and it (48:52 - 48:55)
was like he went (48:53 - 48:58)
why is it so choppy and I'm like I can't (48:55 - 49:00)
talk about this right (48:58 - 49:03)
nope I'm out well I think with (49:00 - 49:05)
um here's the thing that we we didn't (49:03 - 49:09)
talk about area zero is in itself I feel (49:05 - 49:11)
like is shocking (49:09 - 49:14)
um like I I didn't expect (49:11 - 49:18)
almost like a whole second open world in (49:14 - 49:21)
the middle of the game (49:18 - 49:23)
um I guess I I I I I think I said this (49:21 - 49:25)
uh you know like two months ago I kind (49:23 - 49:27)
of expected the center of the map to be (49:25 - 49:30)
like empty or just to be like where one (49:27 - 49:34)
legendary yeah yeah I didn't expect it (49:30 - 49:36)
to be this like multi-layered like like (49:34 - 49:39)
I said almost its own open world like I (49:36 - 49:41)
don't know how big area zero is in (49:39 - 49:43)
relation like I don't know if it's like (49:41 - 49:45)
one-fourth the map size or one eighth (49:43 - 49:47)
the map size it's big though (49:45 - 49:51)
um it's a big space to explore and I (49:47 - 49:51)
think (49:51 - 49:54)
graphic like Graphics aside I don't (49:51 - 49:56)
think the game is very pretty we've (49:54 - 49:57)
we've talked about I've talked about (49:56 - 49:59)
that I don't think the game runs very (49:57 - 50:00)
smoothly I think the frame rate does a (49:59 - 50:03)
big disservice but if you ignore all of (50:00 - 50:05)
that which is a lot to ignore I know (50:03 - 50:07)
that's a lot it's so much to ignore but (50:05 - 50:09)
if you've made it to area zero you've (50:07 - 50:11)
probably ignored most of it that's why (50:09 - 50:14)
you've made it there but like (50:11 - 50:18)
how area zero looks and more importantly (50:14 - 50:19)
I think the thing that stands out the (50:18 - 50:23)
most is the music they used and walking (50:19 - 50:24)
with your characters and talking and (50:23 - 50:26)
there's the there's these interactions (50:24 - 50:29)
where they like you you double battle (50:26 - 50:31)
with Arvin you double battle with Penny (50:29 - 50:33)
you double battle with nimona you get to (50:31 - 50:35)
the final thing everyone kind of is (50:33 - 50:38)
doing their own job like it's almost (50:35 - 50:42)
like it's it's so refreshing and new in (50:38 - 50:44)
a Pokemon game I think it's great I (50:42 - 50:46)
can't help but think like games were (50:44 - 50:48)
doing this 10 years ago this whole like (50:46 - 50:50)
walking and talking and like like (50:48 - 50:52)
everyone kind of doing their own thing (50:50 - 50:55)
to help like cool they did it they got (50:52 - 50:56)
there (50:55 - 50:59)
um and it's great and but that's not to (50:56 - 51:02)
discredit how incredible that music is (50:59 - 51:05)
and how to me shocking that there was (51:02 - 51:08)
almost like a whole (51:05 - 51:13)
new area in the game that you could (51:08 - 51:15)
explore (51:13 - 51:18)
um and yeah I mean like they they kind (51:15 - 51:20)
of you know if you read the books in (51:18 - 51:22)
each of the doors which like to me gave (51:20 - 51:24)
me really big Destiny Vibes a big thing (51:22 - 51:26)
in Destiny is you would get to a door (51:24 - 51:27)
you would hit the button and then the (51:26 - 51:30)
robot would be like all right well it's (51:27 - 51:31)
gonna take me like five to six minutes (51:30 - 51:34)
like defend as I'm like and so it's like (51:31 - 51:35)
Destiny is a lot of like waiting for (51:34 - 51:37)
doors to open as you fight off waves of (51:35 - 51:38)
creatures (51:37 - 51:40)
um it's not really like this but it did (51:38 - 51:42)
give me a big like I gotta hack each (51:40 - 51:44)
door (51:42 - 51:44)
um (51:44 - 51:48)
but the the books kind of give you the (51:44 - 51:50)
sense that DLC is coming right they're (51:48 - 51:52)
talking about a creature that doesn't (51:50 - 51:54)
exist in this game (51:52 - 51:55)
um which you know speculate would be the (51:54 - 51:58)
third Legend uh and we still don't know (51:55 - 52:01)
what crystallizes the that world right (51:58 - 52:03)
there is something crystallizing the (52:01 - 52:06)
world uh (52:03 - 52:06)
but to get to get down there I think (52:07 - 52:12)
that that pacing (52:10 - 52:15)
ah hold on my brain is a million places (52:12 - 52:17)
I love that this is all after the Elite (52:15 - 52:19)
Four yes (52:17 - 52:21)
yeah but if they did it in a better way (52:19 - 52:23)
that wasn't like X and Y and sun and (52:21 - 52:25)
moon X and Y and sun and moon was like (52:23 - 52:28)
I'm Champion okay now battle this guy on (52:25 - 52:29)
the carpet or like I'm Champion now (52:28 - 52:33)
battle tapu Coco it's like whoa like (52:29 - 52:35)
I I should I just want credits and I (52:33 - 52:38)
kind of want to like relax and then in (52:35 - 52:39)
sword and shield they kind of learned (52:38 - 52:41)
their lesson and they were like (52:39 - 52:44)
all all of this stuff you can do (52:41 - 52:45)
afterwards if you want to catch zashi (52:44 - 52:48)
and zamazunta uh sore Burton and shield (52:45 - 52:50)
Bert all after credits you can do it at (52:48 - 52:52)
your own pace which was great because an (52:50 - 52:53)
ongoing joke in my twitch streams were (52:52 - 52:54)
like when are you going to do sirbert (52:53 - 52:56)
and chill Burton was like ah like it (52:54 - 52:57)
took me like three months to do it (52:56 - 52:58)
because I was distracted by everything (52:57 - 53:00)
else you could easily you know get (52:58 - 53:01)
credits be distracted by everything else (53:00 - 53:04)
then come to area zero once you're there (53:01 - 53:06)
I think it's so good uh with everything (53:04 - 53:09)
they built that you want to do it in our (53:06 - 53:12)
sitting you want to hit all four see the (53:09 - 53:14)
ending (53:12 - 53:16)
um so the fact that like (53:14 - 53:18)
quote unquote save the world storyline (53:16 - 53:21)
is out of your face for the first 40 to (53:18 - 53:24)
80 hours of this game (53:21 - 53:27)
again to me incredibly refreshing helps (53:24 - 53:28)
with the pacing and when they get to the (53:27 - 53:30)
save the world it kind of it just makes (53:28 - 53:32)
sense with everything they set up (53:30 - 53:34)
they're just like hey I don't know what (53:32 - 53:36)
the word for this is but it's like when (53:34 - 53:37)
you you're not supposed to bring like (53:36 - 53:39)
plants and animals from other (53:37 - 53:41)
countries because it'll mess up like the (53:39 - 53:45)
is it ecology invasive species invasive (53:41 - 53:46)
species yeah it's pretty much like hey (53:45 - 53:48)
we accidentally brought back some (53:46 - 53:50)
species we don't want them to ruin this (53:48 - 53:52)
world like yeah oh that's all I I just (53:50 - 53:54)
gotta shut down this time machine to fix (53:52 - 53:56)
that perfect like it's such a it's oh (53:54 - 53:58)
it's almost like yeah it saved the world (53:56 - 53:59)
but it feels (53:58 - 54:02)
like reasonable it's like low stakes of (53:59 - 54:03)
like oh I just gotta shut down the (54:02 - 54:04)
machine to fix it apparently it doesn't (54:03 - 54:06)
feel it doesn't feel forced like the (54:04 - 54:08)
sword and shield one did where you're (54:06 - 54:09)
like I do not understand your weird (54:08 - 54:11)
logic around this wait because the logic (54:09 - 54:14)
makes sense again they tied it to a (54:11 - 54:17)
number of good real things like they (54:14 - 54:19)
tied the whole emotional plot line to (54:17 - 54:23)
Arvin and his Dad or Mom whatever (54:19 - 54:26)
um but they also like this is an actual (54:23 - 54:28)
real world problem that we have invasive (54:26 - 54:31)
species that is plaguing us today that (54:28 - 54:33)
we know don't let them into California (54:31 - 54:35)
because they'll eat all the plants like (54:33 - 54:38)
we kind of know how to solve that (54:35 - 54:40)
solution and so you can you can break (54:38 - 54:42)
that out into something more fanciful (54:40 - 54:44)
right like we know the answer (54:42 - 54:47)
if they're allowed to come in they will (54:44 - 54:49)
destroy the region they'll eat all the (54:47 - 54:51)
plants so at the end of that at the end (54:49 - 54:52)
of scarlet Violet you're writing new (54:51 - 54:54)
laws in place of like all right we're (54:52 - 54:57)
not letting Don fans cross their slide (54:54 - 54:59)
here we go okay here we go before you go (54:57 - 55:02)
into messagosa you must check all of (54:59 - 55:05)
your sandwich ingredients (55:02 - 55:08)
um so I think again what this game does (55:05 - 55:11)
really well is it does not ask questions (55:08 - 55:13)
that we don't have answers for (55:11 - 55:16)
and it does it in a way that makes them (55:13 - 55:18)
very human very personal and very (55:16 - 55:20)
relatable (55:18 - 55:24)
um again your relatability will vary but (55:20 - 55:26)
they don't ask things that we can't (55:24 - 55:29)
possibly answer and the fact that for (55:26 - 55:31)
many years the answer Pokemon was like (55:29 - 55:33)
just defeat this guy and we'll worry (55:31 - 55:35)
about it later I mean that's really what (55:33 - 55:36)
they do (55:35 - 55:41)
rose is going to prison I guess okay so (55:36 - 55:43)
what's happening with everything else (55:41 - 55:45)
and is did he actually go to prison (55:43 - 55:49)
where is this supposed prison well (55:45 - 55:50)
spoiler alert (55:49 - 55:53)
it's area zero we just didn't find him (55:50 - 55:56)
um Penny went home to Gallery Rose came (55:53 - 56:00)
to paldaya to be yeah so uh the the (55:56 - 56:03)
actual battle so again I think I think (56:00 - 56:06)
everything just kind of made sense and (56:03 - 56:07)
whether that was because it was so (56:06 - 56:09)
simple I I don't think that's like a (56:07 - 56:12)
disservice I think sometimes it's not (56:09 - 56:15)
like like Cyrus wanting to go to another (56:12 - 56:18)
world to capture Giratina is like okay (56:15 - 56:19)
but (56:18 - 56:22)
what's your what what's your plan if (56:19 - 56:23)
that doesn't work or what is your plan (56:22 - 56:27)
if that does you don't really like flesh (56:23 - 56:31)
that out I mean Cyrus makes me laugh (56:27 - 56:32)
only because (56:31 - 56:36)
their their whole plot line was here's a (56:32 - 56:38)
person that feels really really sad all (56:36 - 56:39)
the time and his solution is to destroy (56:38 - 56:41)
the world so he can make a universe that (56:39 - 56:44)
has no emotions and your solution is to (56:41 - 56:45)
beat him up and send him away I'm like (56:44 - 56:48)
that's that's not an answer he's still (56:45 - 56:50)
super sad (56:48 - 56:53)
like give (56:50 - 56:53)
him he does have Sophocles now although (56:54 - 56:57)
he still lives up destroying the world (56:56 - 56:59)
when he gets overwhelmed but there's not (56:57 - 57:00)
even like (56:59 - 57:03)
there's not even a village in this game (57:00 - 57:06)
there's an antagonist but there's no (57:03 - 57:09)
like villain and I I I I I can't help (57:06 - 57:10)
but think (57:09 - 57:13)
the of of I was listening to a podcast I (57:10 - 57:15)
think it was Giant Bomb and they were (57:13 - 57:18)
talking about Cars the movie Cars the (57:15 - 57:22)
the Pixar movie and and and one of the (57:18 - 57:24)
hosts pointed out that there is no bad (57:22 - 57:28)
guy in cars there is just an issue in (57:24 - 57:30)
cars that all the characters have to (57:28 - 57:34)
solve right there is no there is no (57:30 - 57:35)
villain (57:34 - 57:38)
and they were talking about how their (57:35 - 57:40)
four-year-old son absolutely loves cars (57:38 - 57:42)
it's his favorite movie sure that makes (57:40 - 57:45)
sense like kids like cars like it's also (57:42 - 57:47)
like a marketing machine right you'll (57:45 - 57:48)
make little toys and the kids buy all (57:47 - 57:51)
the cars and then (57:48 - 57:54)
he showed his kid another movie it might (57:51 - 57:55)
have been frozen or something right it (57:54 - 57:58)
doesn't matter pick a Disney movie (57:55 - 58:02)
and the kid questioned why (57:58 - 58:05)
the bad guy was doing bad things (58:02 - 58:08)
and he was like this is so hard to tell (58:05 - 58:12)
my son like that's just a bad person and (58:08 - 58:15)
then he would be like but why is he bad (58:12 - 58:17)
and it was like I never thought about (58:15 - 58:19)
that before and then it made me think (58:17 - 58:20)
about cars even more than I've ever (58:19 - 58:22)
wanted to think about cars because like (58:20 - 58:24)
I hated that movie when I saw that movie (58:22 - 58:26)
in theaters and I hated that movie but (58:24 - 58:28)
then when he pointed out there was no (58:26 - 58:31)
bad guy in cars I was like you're right (58:28 - 58:34)
there there is no like you're so used to (58:31 - 58:37)
like bad good guys and bad guys and like (58:34 - 58:40)
this is the only way to tell a story and (58:37 - 58:43)
again I I guess I've overplayed or (58:40 - 58:45)
overused the word refreshing but like I (58:43 - 58:48)
didn't even feel like the the robot that (58:45 - 58:50)
you you're seeing of like oh the (58:48 - 58:52)
professor built me because in case there (58:50 - 58:54)
was something bad that happened I needed (58:52 - 58:55)
to make sure that the time machine (58:54 - 58:57)
didn't get into the wrong hands but like (58:55 - 59:00)
you have to defeat me because I've been (58:57 - 59:01)
programmed to protect the time machine (59:00 - 59:03)
like it just made sense and it was like (59:01 - 59:05)
I don't see you as a bad guy this is (59:03 - 59:07)
just your Fail-Safe and this is just (59:05 - 59:10)
like we need to like you are going to do (59:07 - 59:11)
everything possible to stop me from (59:10 - 59:13)
shutting this down but that was what you (59:11 - 59:15)
were programmed to do (59:13 - 59:17)
yeah I do find it funny that they would (59:15 - 59:20)
program into the robot that the way to (59:17 - 59:23)
to stop to stop the robot from stopping (59:20 - 59:24)
you is to defeat it in a Pokemon battle (59:23 - 59:27)
it's the most Pokemon thing ever yeah (59:24 - 59:29)
I'm very into that everything is (59:27 - 59:32)
resolved by Pokemon battles I swear I (59:29 - 59:33)
just want to watch Ash trying to get (59:32 - 59:36)
through TSA and then like your pack went (59:33 - 59:39)
off did it let's battle let's see if it (59:36 - 59:41)
really went off as a wrestling fan I'm (59:39 - 59:43)
just used to that right like in (59:41 - 59:45)
wrestling you solve every issue by like (59:43 - 59:47)
oh I guess we're going to the ring to (59:45 - 59:50)
settle again the the I'm programmed this (59:47 - 59:52)
way and you have to shut me down is a (59:50 - 59:53)
plotline that's been around for an (59:52 - 59:57)
incredibly long time yeah and again they (59:53 - 59:58)
broke no new ground (59:57 - 60:02)
compared to the world for Pokemon sure (59:58 - 60:04)
um but again like there are value in (60:02 - 60:07)
those stories right like there are ways (60:04 - 60:11)
that you need to teach kids like (60:07 - 60:14)
there are there are sometimes bad people (60:11 - 60:16)
who are going to do bad things and you (60:14 - 60:18)
need to be aware of it and then there (60:16 - 60:20)
are also times when there are no bad (60:18 - 60:21)
people and you need to work together (60:20 - 60:24)
they are two different stories and they (60:21 - 60:26)
work well together and like if you don't (60:24 - 60:29)
know how to tell your child (60:26 - 60:31)
why is that bad person doing bad things (60:29 - 60:33)
and you weren't prepared for that (60:31 - 60:35)
question (60:33 - 60:38)
like come on like that is like a (60:35 - 60:39)
fundamental thing you need to be (60:38 - 60:43)
prepping your children for (60:39 - 60:43)
yeah like like uh I I I I think the (60:43 - 60:49)
music (60:48 - 60:51)
for that battle is absolutely fantastic (60:49 - 60:55)
I think there was something so cool (60:51 - 60:55)
and as as much as we complained that (60:56 - 61:03)
game freak can't program or why is the (61:00 - 61:05)
frame rate so bad or why can't we Master (61:03 - 61:06)
release (61:05 - 61:08)
who there there is there is so much (61:06 - 61:11)
talent over there I have like the music (61:08 - 61:15)
the character design like the just (61:11 - 61:19)
Pokemon in general having a a a robot (61:15 - 61:23)
Professor shoot 80 feet into the sky on (61:19 - 61:26)
a crystal and then casually drop down (61:23 - 61:30)
master balls with either prehistoric or (61:26 - 61:33)
futuristic Pokemon is an image I will (61:30 - 61:36)
never get out of my head it was so (61:33 - 61:41)
iconic it like out of I think of like 26 (61:36 - 61:44)
27 years of Pokemon and that may be (61:41 - 61:46)
because it's so fresh I just I just (61:44 - 61:48)
don't think I would ever forget it was (61:46 - 61:50)
so impactful (61:48 - 61:51)
um and whether or not you thought that (61:50 - 61:54)
battle was easy or hard again your (61:51 - 61:55)
mileage would vary depending on your (61:54 - 61:57)
Pokemon for me it was a little tougher (61:55 - 61:59)
because like literally every futuristic (61:57 - 62:01)
Pokemon had like three electric type (61:59 - 62:03)
moves I'm sure if I played Violet it (62:01 - 62:04)
would have been they probably would have (62:03 - 62:06)
all had like ground moves or something (62:04 - 62:08)
right like I'm not 100 sure the (62:06 - 62:10)
difference so like yeah it was a little (62:08 - 62:12)
harder for me as using all water Pokemon (62:10 - 62:15)
but like just the imagery the music like (62:12 - 62:18)
yeah they did that weird like static I'm (62:15 - 62:21)
breaking up thing the the the language (62:18 - 62:23)
actually like changing again not a new (62:21 - 62:25)
thing I've seen like multiple games like (62:23 - 62:27)
just change the font and stuff but like (62:25 - 62:30)
thematically they nailed it yeah I mean (62:27 - 62:33)
it ranks out of there with with Lucy (62:30 - 62:35)
mean combining with the ultra Beast (62:33 - 62:37)
right like that that moment where you're (62:35 - 62:41)
like we're off the rails now folks (62:37 - 62:45)
uh yeah it was they were great very good (62:41 - 62:48)
moments right like they they they made a (62:45 - 62:49)
very polished (62:48 - 62:51)
experience and the game ran better for (62:49 - 62:54)
me in area zero probably because it was (62:51 - 62:55)
detached from everything else and it (62:54 - 62:58)
just had to work on its own (62:55 - 63:00)
um (62:58 - 63:02)
legitimately that may well be a thing (63:00 - 63:04)
because like I believe the game in (63:02 - 63:06)
general loads the whole map while you're (63:04 - 63:08)
running around whereas an area zero is (63:06 - 63:09)
just loading in the area zero Maps yeah (63:08 - 63:12)
like I had no problem scenario zero I I (63:09 - 63:14)
I think you know you were talking Steve (63:12 - 63:17)
about the you know how how different it (63:14 - 63:20)
feels and how shocked you were about how (63:17 - 63:23)
it looked I I think it's it's very (63:20 - 63:26)
dramatic like you walk in there and yeah (63:23 - 63:28)
I like you I was expecting it to just be (63:26 - 63:31)
like this this crater right like it I (63:28 - 63:32)
mean that was what I had assumed I don't (63:31 - 63:34)
know whether it said somewhere that (63:32 - 63:35)
there was a I'm sure somewhere said (63:34 - 63:38)
about meteor right yeah yeah so I was (63:35 - 63:41)
just expecting the boring crater and you (63:38 - 63:43)
walk in and you're like this massive (63:41 - 63:46)
Cavern with with waterfalls and and like (63:43 - 63:49)
the clouds over the top like I thought I (63:46 - 63:51)
mean I personally thought it was really (63:49 - 63:53)
good looking like obviously there's (63:51 - 63:54)
still the frame rate issues absolutely (63:53 - 63:57)
absolutely totally accept that but I (63:54 - 63:58)
thought that specific typically it is (63:57 - 64:01)
you know actually looked good actively (63:58 - 64:02)
good I know not everybody agrees with (64:01 - 64:04)
that but I think it actively looked good (64:02 - 64:06)
can we also talk about how strong your (64:04 - 64:08)
friends are that they were able to hold (64:06 - 64:11)
you while your Mount jumped off a cliff (64:08 - 64:13)
and you're like flying out they're like (64:11 - 64:17)
iron grip how strong are you people (64:13 - 64:21)
this should have come up before this (64:17 - 64:22)
I I think (64:21 - 64:27)
whether or not you you liked the stories (64:22 - 64:27)
I I think as like I feel like this game (64:29 - 64:38)
as a whole is just it it feels so (64:33 - 64:39)
complete (64:38 - 64:41)
like you have this open world and these (64:39 - 64:44)
three stories and they all they're all (64:41 - 64:46)
doing their own unique thing in my (64:44 - 64:48)
perspective right like you Titans team (64:46 - 64:50)
star whatever they come together you (64:48 - 64:52)
have that then you have a whole other (64:50 - 64:55)
area where they're actually tying the (64:52 - 64:56)
three together like this is the first (64:55 - 64:59)
time all four characters are in an area (64:56 - 65:02)
and (64:59 - 65:04)
it I don't think it overstays its (65:02 - 65:06)
welcome like it didn't feel like a drag (65:04 - 65:08)
and you go through that and you have (65:06 - 65:09)
that Professor battle and then you have (65:08 - 65:12)
that like conclusion of friendship it (65:09 - 65:14)
really just felt to me like (65:12 - 65:20)
a very conclusive experience versus (65:14 - 65:20)
you know like X and Y where you're like (65:20 - 65:25)
two gems and then you're like where's (65:23 - 65:27)
the third gym for like 17 hours and then (65:25 - 65:30)
all of a sudden four gyms and then you (65:27 - 65:32)
got to do the flower cannon and then the (65:30 - 65:33)
last gym and then Elite Four and then (65:32 - 65:34)
you're like (65:33 - 65:36)
I guess I'm done (65:34 - 65:38)
and then you battle AZ on the carpet and (65:36 - 65:40)
you're like oh what and then you're like (65:38 - 65:43)
okay and now I'm done and then you know (65:40 - 65:46)
to be fair X and Y doesn't X and Y has a (65:43 - 65:48)
lot to do xma is terrible pacing right (65:46 - 65:50)
but X and Y has a lot to do if you (65:48 - 65:52)
search that stuff out (65:50 - 65:53)
um (65:52 - 65:57)
I I just think there's like so much to (65:53 - 66:00)
do I think they've figured out a way to (65:57 - 66:04)
give you story appropriately where it (66:00 - 66:05)
didn't feel so in your face like sun and (66:04 - 66:07)
moon (66:05 - 66:09)
um or like maybe (66:07 - 66:10)
you know some people said like sword and (66:09 - 66:11)
shield was like very in your face I (66:10 - 66:13)
didn't feel that but like (66:11 - 66:17)
I don't know it just it really (66:13 - 66:21)
it makes me so mad that the game is as (66:17 - 66:23)
ugly as it is and runs as poorly as it (66:21 - 66:27)
does because I I just feel like there's (66:23 - 66:30)
something so special here (66:27 - 66:34)
and it's literally ruined ruined a lot (66:30 - 66:37)
of people's experiences because of (66:34 - 66:40)
how poorly it runs yeah and you could (66:37 - 66:42)
like you'd be like well maybe they need (66:40 - 66:44)
more three maybe they need more than (66:42 - 66:46)
three years for a game yeah probably (66:44 - 66:50)
maybe maybe Nintendo should do something (66:46 - 66:53)
okay like I hate that maybe Nintendo (66:50 - 66:55)
should do something as like Nintendo (66:53 - 66:57)
itself hasn't released bad games right (66:55 - 67:00)
like what they literally put out Wii (66:57 - 67:00)
Sports (67:00 - 67:03)
Nintendo switch Edition and they didn't (67:00 - 67:05)
even launch it with golf (67:03 - 67:08)
and like the uh like the online is (67:05 - 67:10)
anyway there I could I could keep naming (67:08 - 67:12)
different I mean people are like what (67:10 - 67:13)
the breath of the wild breath of the (67:12 - 67:15)
wild Mario Odyssey yes those are two (67:13 - 67:17)
games Nintendo releases a lot of games (67:15 - 67:20)
they're all not perfect no um here's the (67:17 - 67:22)
thing I I (67:20 - 67:24)
scarlet and violet (67:22 - 67:27)
easily could have been game of the year (67:24 - 67:30)
easy the things that they did (67:27 - 67:33)
when they when they when they hit the (67:30 - 67:36)
note they hit that note but the rest of (67:33 - 67:39)
the song is awful and unfortunately (67:36 - 67:43)
there are so many problems with it yeah (67:39 - 67:45)
you just can't (67:43 - 67:49)
like I can't recommend it to people I'm (67:45 - 67:50)
like (67:49 - 67:53)
are you a big Pokemon fan and are you (67:50 - 67:55)
willing to look past a lot of really bad (67:53 - 67:58)
things because sometimes the game is (67:55 - 68:00)
like there are still times when I roll (67:58 - 68:03)
up to a town when everybody's in frame (68:00 - 68:05)
rate City that I'm like (68:03 - 68:09)
how is this acceptable I can't I can't (68:05 - 68:13)
handle this it's so frustrating (68:09 - 68:13)
uh but like yeah I think (68:13 - 68:18)
again I think why it's so frustrating to (68:15 - 68:21)
me I'm sorry Al is because I think the (68:18 - 68:23)
ending to that game (68:21 - 68:25)
is so good (68:23 - 68:26)
I'm not I'm not even talking about story (68:25 - 68:29)
I'm talking about like that battle the (68:26 - 68:31)
moment of Crystal shooting up in the air (68:29 - 68:34)
the the the pacing they take you down (68:31 - 68:37)
the area zero with the music and the bat (68:34 - 68:40)
like that whole thing is like what I (68:37 - 68:44)
want in a video game I want this (68:40 - 68:47)
experience and you did this experience (68:44 - 68:52)
and it was a great way to end that game (68:47 - 68:55)
um so you like look and you're like (68:52 - 68:58)
whoever decided to make the professor (68:55 - 69:00)
shoot 80 feet in the air and drop master (68:58 - 69:03)
balls I I am sure that person isn't (69:00 - 69:05)
coding the frame rate whoever designed (69:03 - 69:09)
tulip isn't the person uh making the (69:05 - 69:11)
whole making fixing the ram issues (69:09 - 69:15)
whoever designed goldango or golden go (69:11 - 69:17)
however you say his name probably isn't (69:15 - 69:20)
the person who decided to load the menu (69:17 - 69:22)
system right like there are so many (69:20 - 69:26)
talented people there that made a lot of (69:22 - 69:29)
special things and then there are the (69:26 - 69:31)
programmers who (69:29 - 69:34)
might have best up their job like again (69:31 - 69:36)
I don't want to point like like the (69:34 - 69:39)
frame rate the graphics the whatever (69:36 - 69:41)
loading the map the ram whoever whatever (69:39 - 69:45)
is happening that's all bad and the (69:41 - 69:47)
third thing is though everything else I (69:45 - 69:49)
don't think I don't think we should (69:47 - 69:53)
should be trying to figure out uh you (69:49 - 69:55)
know what who caused the issues I've (69:53 - 69:57)
seen loads of videos of people like oh (69:55 - 69:59)
here's a here's a theory on who who's to (69:57 - 70:01)
blame I really don't like this because (69:59 - 70:03)
like these things are really complicated (70:01 - 70:05)
yeah totally not even just in terms of (70:03 - 70:06)
programming but in terms of like (70:05 - 70:08)
organization yeah and we don't know like (70:06 - 70:10)
it could have been like that all the (70:08 - 70:12)
programmers are terrible that's a (70:10 - 70:13)
possibility sure I don't think that's (70:12 - 70:15)
true I I really don't think that's true (70:13 - 70:17)
because like there are quite a lot of (70:15 - 70:18)
people at game freak who've been there (70:17 - 70:21)
like the entire time and are very clever (70:18 - 70:24)
people and know what they're doing 100 (70:21 - 70:25)
um (70:24 - 70:27)
I am not convinced it's there or they (70:25 - 70:29)
don't know how to make a 3D game uh (70:27 - 70:32)
because like Legends Arceus was great (70:29 - 70:34)
now you could say that the it didn't (70:32 - 70:35)
look as good as a good fight whatever (70:34 - 70:38)
but that's not the same thing right it (70:35 - 70:39)
ran really well and it played really (70:38 - 70:43)
well and it was fun and so it could be (70:39 - 70:45)
it could be these things combined it (70:43 - 70:47)
could be a number of issues it could be (70:45 - 70:49)
the fact that they use people from (70:47 - 70:50)
certain because because the thing is (70:49 - 70:52)
right it's not just people who work for (70:50 - 70:53)
Game Freak who who have programmed on (70:52 - 70:56)
this game there are contractors that use (70:53 - 70:58)
you can see that all in the credits (70:56 - 70:59)
there are plenty of people who work on (70:58 - 71:02)
this game who are not it could be that (70:59 - 71:04)
it could be the timeline and the (71:02 - 71:05)
timeline we don't know who decides the (71:04 - 71:07)
timeline we don't know that we don't (71:05 - 71:08)
know if it's game frequency we're going (71:07 - 71:10)
to do this by this point we don't know (71:08 - 71:11)
if it's (71:10 - 71:13)
the Pokemon company says it must happen (71:11 - 71:15)
by this point we don't know who does (71:13 - 71:17)
that and it could be just (71:15 - 71:19)
re-prioritizing of things like someone (71:17 - 71:22)
has said no no in management no no this (71:19 - 71:23)
is not going to be prioritized we're (71:22 - 71:25)
going to prioritize that instead and (71:23 - 71:27)
that has led to this situation like (71:25 - 71:29)
there's not someone who goes oh I'm (71:27 - 71:31)
going to program in this bug that makes (71:29 - 71:34)
this really really bad right and you I (71:31 - 71:37)
know for a fact that there are going to (71:34 - 71:39)
be people who work at game freak plenty (71:37 - 71:41)
of them who are disappointed with what (71:39 - 71:43)
they released oh and who have been (71:41 - 71:45)
saying for months they have been saying (71:43 - 71:48)
for months that this needs more time (71:45 - 71:50)
yeah and that these things need to be (71:48 - 71:51)
prioritized over these these other (71:50 - 71:52)
things and we don't know who those are (71:51 - 71:55)
and we don't and I just yeah I really (71:52 - 71:56)
don't want to get into the blame game (71:55 - 71:59)
because yeah they messed up right the (71:56 - 72:02)
the game runs terribly and there are (71:59 - 72:04)
many bad design decisions in this game (72:02 - 72:08)
but like it's not about individuals it's (72:04 - 72:09)
about (72:08 - 72:13)
the culture as a whole and the (72:09 - 72:15)
complications because it's a real like (72:13 - 72:18)
there are several hundred people who (72:15 - 72:19)
worked in this game (72:18 - 72:22)
and those decisions are not made by one (72:19 - 72:23)
person right (72:22 - 72:26)
you know yeah no I I a million percent (72:23 - 72:28)
agree with you like again I guess it's (72:26 - 72:30)
the frustration of like well Nintendo (72:28 - 72:32)
wouldn't have let this happen of like (72:30 - 72:35)
Nintendo not releasing right yeah like (72:32 - 72:37)
like Nintendo knew what was going out (72:35 - 72:39)
the door like Nintendo was the people (72:37 - 72:41)
who sat down and showed me the game and (72:39 - 72:43)
they were genuinely excited about (72:41 - 72:45)
certain things yeah (72:43 - 72:49)
um yeah and you know it's like well the (72:45 - 72:51)
Pokemon company makes all this money and (72:49 - 72:53)
again I have to stress like every time (72:51 - 72:54)
they sell a Pikachu plush on Pokemon (72:53 - 72:56)
Center doesn't mean that game free gets (72:54 - 72:58)
another dollar they have their budgets (72:56 - 73:00)
like this is not unique to these (72:58 - 73:03)
companies right like like twitch like (73:00 - 73:04)
mixer (73:03 - 73:07)
could could have survived because of (73:04 - 73:10)
Microsoft but mixer was not pulling its (73:07 - 73:12)
own weight and Microsoft shut it down (73:10 - 73:14)
but if Microsoft wanted to go head to (73:12 - 73:16)
head with twitch Microsoft has infinite (73:14 - 73:18)
money they could have kept mixer around (73:16 - 73:21)
for 5 10 15 years with mixer taking a (73:18 - 73:24)
loss amazon.com does not make Amazon (73:21 - 73:26)
money it takes a loss every single year (73:24 - 73:29)
the the reason that Amazon makes money (73:26 - 73:31)
is AWS yes the reason that Pokemon (73:29 - 73:33)
company makes money is because they sell (73:31 - 73:36)
a lot of plushes and a lot of 500 (73:33 - 73:39)
watches and a lot of 400 Rayquaza pens (73:36 - 73:42)
like game freak still has a (73:39 - 73:44)
responsibility to like (73:42 - 73:47)
do whatever game freak needs to do to (73:44 - 73:49)
stay afloat sure can the Pokemon money (73:47 - 73:51)
company Pokemon money that's true but if (73:49 - 73:53)
the can the Pokemon company give them (73:51 - 73:55)
more money yes can they give them more (73:53 - 73:58)
time we I no one can answer that (73:55 - 73:59)
question because we don't know who is (73:58 - 74:01)
setting the time we don't know if (73:59 - 74:02)
gamefreak is setting their own time we (74:01 - 74:04)
don't know if Pokemon company is we (74:02 - 74:06)
don't don't maybe it's Nintendo we just (74:04 - 74:08)
do not know maybe it's the three of them (74:06 - 74:10)
coming together being like how much time (74:08 - 74:12)
do you need three years okay we're all (74:10 - 74:14)
in agreement for three years and then (74:12 - 74:16)
stuff doesn't happen right like it it's (74:14 - 74:18)
so hard we love (74:16 - 74:20)
we love to blame as well because we had (74:18 - 74:23)
last year with brilliant Diamond shining (74:20 - 74:25)
Peril everyone was blaming ilka for this (74:23 - 74:26)
oh the game would have been so much (74:25 - 74:29)
better if gamefreak had built it and now (74:26 - 74:30)
we're on the opposite end of that (74:29 - 74:33)
Spectrum you know it's right we were on (74:30 - 74:35)
the like I wish somebody else would make (74:33 - 74:37)
a Pokemon game that isn't game okay now (74:35 - 74:39)
we we have that yeah yeah (74:37 - 74:43)
that the thing is is that ultimately (74:39 - 74:43)
what what why are we seeking blame it is (74:43 - 74:49)
a it is a pointless useless thing the (74:46 - 74:51)
bottom line is a company made a bad (74:49 - 74:53)
product and they will either learn from (74:51 - 74:56)
it or they won't and your choice is to (74:53 - 75:00)
continue purchasing it or not and if (74:56 - 75:02)
this was a bridge too far for you (75:00 - 75:03)
cool (75:02 - 75:07)
be God be done be happy live your life (75:03 - 75:10)
to be gone (75:07 - 75:13)
but the other thing too is like I you (75:10 - 75:15)
know there there was a point where (75:13 - 75:18)
Destiny was bad I mean some could argue (75:15 - 75:20)
that Destiny was always bad but there (75:18 - 75:21)
there was a point where Destiny was bad (75:20 - 75:24)
and Bungie made decisions and they (75:21 - 75:27)
updated the game I mean we know that (75:24 - 75:30)
this game will probably get DLC we know (75:27 - 75:31)
that this game will receive an update (75:30 - 75:34)
they did formally apologize in the last (75:31 - 75:38)
update so it is possible and look I'm (75:34 - 75:39)
not coming on this program we're not (75:38 - 75:42)
ending this episode saying like we had I (75:39 - 75:44)
think it's very clear after talking 10 (75:42 - 75:46)
hours that we have all had different (75:44 - 75:48)
enjoyment levels of this game but at the (75:46 - 75:50)
end of the day we all enjoyed it to an (75:48 - 75:52)
extent right I'm still playing it I will (75:50 - 75:54)
still continue to play it (75:52 - 75:55)
um (75:54 - 75:58)
but that doesn't mean that the frame (75:55 - 76:00)
rate the graphics whatever else the bugs (75:58 - 76:05)
those three things don't hinder people's (76:00 - 76:08)
experiences and if they update it and if (76:05 - 76:10)
they fix it it would be very easy for me (76:08 - 76:13)
to recommend and to tell people but that (76:10 - 76:16)
doesn't erase people's oppressions going (76:13 - 76:19)
through and maybe that was that's why I (76:16 - 76:21)
was so hard on the whole like map thing (76:19 - 76:24)
because you can't undo it once you beat (76:21 - 76:27)
the game you've that experience is there (76:24 - 76:29)
whether or not you went in the correct (76:27 - 76:32)
order or your own order now that you're (76:29 - 76:35)
done with it you know the order now that (76:32 - 76:36)
you've whether you went in the right (76:35 - 76:39)
order you still can't forget that like (76:36 - 76:41)
oh I fell through the floor like eight (76:39 - 76:43)
times or oh my game crashed or oh like (76:41 - 76:44)
when I was in the graffiti the graphite (76:43 - 76:46)
eye Forest I went at like three frames a (76:44 - 76:48)
second like I was at the top of a (76:46 - 76:49)
mountain (76:48 - 76:52)
and a Gardevoir and krillia spawned in (76:49 - 76:54)
on the side and I just watched them (76:52 - 76:57)
slide off into Oblivion and I'm like I (76:54 - 77:00)
will okay I will say that with what one (76:57 - 77:02)
exception Steve is that I don't want (77:00 - 77:04)
them to fix all the bugs because some of (77:02 - 77:06)
them are just very funny did you see the (77:04 - 77:10)
slope so the Slowbro bug (77:06 - 77:10)
so there was there was a there was a bug (77:10 - 77:15)
that they didn't fix because I I still (77:12 - 77:16)
have this bug but there was a bug where (77:15 - 77:18)
a great ball would spawn in like a room (77:16 - 77:20)
so this would be very common in the (77:18 - 77:22)
school so every time you'd walk through (77:20 - 77:24)
a door you'd see a little great ball on (77:22 - 77:26)
the floor and I think people speculated (77:24 - 77:28)
that this was like how they centered the (77:26 - 77:31)
room or like where like the point of (77:28 - 77:34)
everything should be around it seemed (77:31 - 77:35)
like a pointer is what people said I (77:34 - 77:37)
don't know I I've never built a game uh (77:35 - 77:39)
but anyways it was very noticeable at (77:37 - 77:41)
doorways so I guess that made sense (77:39 - 77:43)
um but somebody instead of getting a (77:41 - 77:46)
great ball they just got a slow bro yep (77:43 - 77:48)
so every room they walked in there was (77:46 - 77:50)
just a slow break sitting there and then (77:48 - 77:52)
they went outside and they started like (77:50 - 77:55)
catching Pokemon and battling people and (77:52 - 77:57)
the Slowbro would still be there and I (77:55 - 77:59)
was like don't fix that that sounds (77:57 - 78:02)
incredible uh one final point I want to (77:59 - 78:04)
make about area zero (78:02 - 78:07)
is that's what I want from games right (78:04 - 78:09)
when I say I want a non-open world (78:07 - 78:12)
because you can make a singular very (78:09 - 78:14)
well-contained story in one area where (78:12 - 78:17)
the entire area fits that story that's (78:14 - 78:19)
what I like in games (78:17 - 78:23)
area zero was like uh yes this I'm home (78:19 - 78:26)
this is what I want a contained strong (78:23 - 78:31)
story in one area that's in here and I (78:26 - 78:33)
get text over things because you know (78:31 - 78:35)
where I'm going and you can tell me a (78:33 - 78:39)
cool story that is what I want (78:35 - 78:39)
uh also I think (78:40 - 78:44)
we should talk about this and this will (78:42 - 78:46)
be our final thing before we wrap up is (78:44 - 78:48)
the the miraidon versus meridon Corydon (78:46 - 78:51)
vs karate on Battle (78:48 - 78:52)
um oh yeah (78:51 - 78:55)
that you know I think the professor (78:52 - 78:57)
battle was really great uh your mileage (78:55 - 78:59)
may vary depending on your team (78:57 - 79:00)
um (78:59 - 79:05)
music very good they they give you (79:00 - 79:09)
it's a I I don't know if most people (79:05 - 79:11)
you know when when I guess when I'm (79:09 - 79:13)
describing or talking I kind of think of (79:11 - 79:16)
like a casual person not necessarily a (79:13 - 79:18)
hardcore Pokemon fan (79:16 - 79:19)
um (79:18 - 79:21)
but I I think of like the Casual people (79:19 - 79:23)
who go through that battle and I don't (79:21 - 79:24)
know if people know that like that (79:23 - 79:27)
battle is really scripted (79:24 - 79:29)
um but I don't necessarily think that's (79:27 - 79:31)
bad (79:29 - 79:33)
um because they the thing that they're (79:31 - 79:35)
trying to do in that battle it was very (79:33 - 79:38)
obvious to me uh is they wanted you to (79:35 - 79:41)
feel that you're about to lose and then (79:38 - 79:43)
for your friends to cheer you on and (79:41 - 79:47)
then for you to ultimately win and it's (79:43 - 79:50)
funny because I think that's what most (79:47 - 79:54)
hardcore fans want I think when people (79:50 - 79:56)
go like oh I want a hard Pokemon game or (79:54 - 80:00)
I want something to like challenge me I (79:56 - 80:01)
feel like what they're actually asking (80:00 - 80:03)
for is like (80:01 - 80:06)
I want to feel like I I was supposed to (80:03 - 80:08)
lose and that I won (80:06 - 80:11)
like oh I shouldn't have won that and I (80:08 - 80:13)
did and that feels great right like you (80:11 - 80:15)
see jaded competitive fans and they're (80:13 - 80:16)
never like (80:15 - 80:18)
they're never like oh they're always (80:16 - 80:20)
like well I would have won if they (80:18 - 80:22)
didn't hit Thunder Wave or like oh I (80:20 - 80:24)
would have won if if they didn't (80:22 - 80:26)
critical hit me right like they know why (80:24 - 80:30)
they lost and I I don't think anyone (80:26 - 80:31)
like loses against tulip and they're (80:30 - 80:34)
like I don't know how to beat her like (80:31 - 80:38)
like but in this in this battle (80:34 - 80:40)
I think they almost always taunt you (80:38 - 80:42)
right away and they purposely give you (80:40 - 80:46)
endure and I would argue I don't have (80:42 - 80:48)
the numbers for it that a casual Pokemon (80:46 - 80:50)
fan (80:48 - 80:53)
um never uses like growl or never uses (80:50 - 80:55)
Screech or like never uses like protect (80:53 - 80:57)
right they're just what's the super (80:55 - 80:59)
effective move I'm gonna hit it and I (80:57 - 81:00)
think I talked about this a couple (80:59 - 81:02)
episodes ago where like in order for me (81:00 - 81:05)
to win a match I needed to not use the (81:02 - 81:07)
super effective move and I needed to use (81:05 - 81:09)
icy win that was the only way I would (81:07 - 81:11)
have won is to hit the icy win button (81:09 - 81:12)
and do like two damage but slow slow (81:11 - 81:15)
them down for my next Pokemon (81:12 - 81:18)
and there were multiple ways to win the (81:15 - 81:21)
Corydon vs karidon match but I think (81:18 - 81:22)
ultimately what they wanted you to do (81:21 - 81:25)
was indoor get to one HP everyone cheers (81:22 - 81:28)
and then you had time to terasolize and (81:25 - 81:29)
then knock out (81:28 - 81:31)
um but I saw other people like use (81:29 - 81:33)
potions because like literally didn't (81:31 - 81:35)
know what endure did they were like oh I (81:33 - 81:36)
didn't know I was supposed to press this (81:35 - 81:38)
button so I just like hyper potioned and (81:36 - 81:39)
I even I didn't even think of that (81:38 - 81:41)
because I thought about what the game (81:39 - 81:45)
was asking me to do like oh yeah I'm (81:41 - 81:47)
going to indoor I'm going to survive (81:45 - 81:48)
this hit my next turn I'll be able to (81:47 - 81:50)
tracelize he's half Health I'll be able (81:48 - 81:52)
to do enough damage so it was very (81:50 - 81:55)
interesting I'd actually be I'm sure (81:52 - 81:56)
nothing happens if you lose the match (81:55 - 81:59)
I'm sure it just restarts but like (81:56 - 82:02)
it was to me it was just interesting (81:59 - 82:04)
they made a very (82:02 - 82:07)
oh my gosh you're going to lose let all (82:04 - 82:09)
your friends cheer you won because they (82:07 - 82:11)
were trying to like how else do you (82:09 - 82:14)
really tell that story without kind of (82:11 - 82:16)
setting it up and again I don't think (82:14 - 82:19)
it's bad I think it worked I you already (82:16 - 82:21)
had your tough battle with the six that (82:19 - 82:24)
the the professor used so to like end on (82:21 - 82:27)
a more scripted thing but again I don't (82:24 - 82:28)
think a lot of people I think the (82:27 - 82:31)
majority of people and not that's a bad (82:28 - 82:33)
thing probably didn't realize how (82:31 - 82:34)
scripted it was people listening to the (82:33 - 82:36)
show probably realized that it was a (82:34 - 82:39)
pretty scripted match yeah yeah I I mean (82:36 - 82:41)
I generally don't like the sort of (82:39 - 82:42)
scripted stuff because I I feel like (82:41 - 82:44)
that kind of pulls me out of the game (82:42 - 82:46)
like I'm playing a game blah blah blah (82:44 - 82:49)
however I was fine with it in this thing (82:46 - 82:52)
because like it it wasn't the game (82:49 - 82:54)
interrupting you with something it was (82:52 - 82:56)
okay when you're ready come over to this (82:54 - 82:57)
point and we'll do this and I was like (82:56 - 82:59)
right okay so I'm ready for the final (82:57 - 83:02)
bit of story and then that whole bit was (82:59 - 83:04)
like it's what Greg's looking for in a (83:02 - 83:07)
game the the all of that it's not what (83:04 - 83:08)
I'm looking for in a game but I'm fine (83:07 - 83:11)
with it as long as it's like I get to (83:08 - 83:13)
choose when it happens (83:11 - 83:15)
um so like I went okay now I'm ready for (83:13 - 83:18)
area zero let's go and do with it and (83:15 - 83:20)
then I spent an hour or so in there (83:18 - 83:22)
doing that that's fine I just hate it (83:20 - 83:23)
when like these things kind of interrupt (83:22 - 83:27)
your normal game Flow yeah (83:23 - 83:29)
yeah it was interesting to watch (83:27 - 83:32)
other people do it and them like not (83:29 - 83:36)
realizing what endure did or not like (83:32 - 83:38)
um I wasn't gonna do anything other than (83:36 - 83:40)
what it told me to do why why would I (83:38 - 83:41)
was clearly it was wanting you to do (83:40 - 83:43)
like I I watched so many people on (83:41 - 83:45)
Twitch or just talk to people who walked (83:43 - 83:47)
through that fight and was like like a (83:45 - 83:49)
lot of people didn't even like realize (83:47 - 83:51)
why they were taunting and it was just (83:49 - 83:52)
you know (83:51 - 83:55)
it's it's I think the thing I learned a (83:52 - 83:57)
lot through sword and shield (83:55 - 83:59)
is that (83:57 - 84:03)
I think the hardcore Pokemon fans are so (83:59 - 84:05)
vocal in thinking that these games are (84:03 - 84:08)
easy or that they they need something (84:05 - 84:11)
more when like the reason game freak is (84:08 - 84:13)
selling 26 million copies of sword and (84:11 - 84:15)
shield is because they know their (84:13 - 84:17)
audience and they know what they're (84:15 - 84:19)
selling it to again we are in a (84:17 - 84:21)
community of Hardcore Pokemon people (84:19 - 84:23)
right like people who are going to go (84:21 - 84:26)
out of their way to watch people play (84:23 - 84:28)
and listen about Pokemon (84:26 - 84:30)
are not that far on the Casual side (84:28 - 84:33)
right so we tend to hear from them a lot (84:30 - 84:35)
the people that have been playing these (84:33 - 84:39)
games for hundreds of years now and know (84:35 - 84:42)
the things in and out but I I do think (84:39 - 84:45)
like (84:42 - 84:45)
the scripting of that again I I do enjoy (84:45 - 84:52)
a well-scripted (84:49 - 84:56)
tense ending right like I knew that (84:52 - 84:57)
there was probably very little chance I (84:56 - 85:00)
was going to lose that fight because boy (84:57 - 85:02)
what that's not a way you end a (85:00 - 85:04)
storyline right (85:02 - 85:07)
um but still they evoked all the right (85:04 - 85:10)
moments and all the right things and (85:07 - 85:12)
they they really sort of brought (85:10 - 85:16)
everybody together as a final uh moment (85:12 - 85:20)
of triumph which I think the game needed (85:16 - 85:23)
um still think it was like (85:20 - 85:25)
short shift nerve it a little bit but uh (85:23 - 85:27)
I I think it was well I think it was (85:25 - 85:29)
what (85:27 - 85:31)
I think is what they needed to end this (85:29 - 85:34)
leg of the story on yeah yeah we know (85:31 - 85:36)
there's more Story coming there is yes (85:34 - 85:38)
they needed to end (85:36 - 85:41)
this tale of bringing everybody together (85:38 - 85:45)
including your legendary Pokemon to (85:41 - 85:49)
actually be like and everybody is at the (85:45 - 85:51)
end of their journey and ready to start (85:49 - 85:54)
a new one yeah and I would I would argue (85:51 - 85:57)
that like this game has a lot to do post (85:54 - 85:59)
I saw somebody like tweet like man I (85:57 - 86:00)
wish there was post game and I was like (85:59 - 86:02)
what are you talking about because like (86:00 - 86:04)
you could you could argue that area zero (86:02 - 86:06)
is not post game but it it is like when (86:04 - 86:08)
you first go through it you're not (86:06 - 86:10)
really exploring it (86:08 - 86:13)
um like you still have to catch the (86:10 - 86:15)
other Legend they give you two Corydon (86:13 - 86:16)
and two Mirai on both games which is (86:15 - 86:18)
great because you would ideally trade (86:16 - 86:20)
the other one you have to catch the (86:18 - 86:23)
killer you have you you like uh once you (86:20 - 86:25)
beat the game and you have to do all the (86:23 - 86:26)
gym leaders again (86:25 - 86:28)
um which is great uh there's a (86:26 - 86:29)
tournament that opens up their six star (86:28 - 86:32)
raids that open up like I do feel like (86:29 - 86:36)
there's a lot like again for a game that (86:32 - 86:38)
you know people are like oh they need (86:36 - 86:40)
more time and there's crunch I'm not (86:38 - 86:42)
debating the frame rate or the graphics (86:40 - 86:45)
but like there's a lot of game here uh (86:42 - 86:46)
and I think that was the point I was (86:45 - 86:49)
trying to make earlier like yes it would (86:46 - 86:51)
they spent three years on it yes there (86:49 - 86:52)
are clearly things that were not (86:51 - 86:53)
finished like Pokemon's eyes closing (86:52 - 86:58)
during battle but there is so much game (86:53 - 86:59)
here (86:58 - 87:03)
uh that it kind of gets overshadowed by (86:59 - 87:06)
bugs and frame rate and that is fixable (87:03 - 87:09)
yeah the obvious flaws take away from (87:06 - 87:10)
the game (87:09 - 87:13)
um but there there's a lot of game after (87:10 - 87:16)
after you get credits uh (87:13 - 87:20)
so yeah I think that's our credits I (87:16 - 87:23)
think uh we're good with this series (87:20 - 87:25)
um which means that (87:23 - 87:27)
it's been three weeks I think by the (87:25 - 87:28)
time these episodes come out it'll be (87:27 - 87:30)
three weeks that the games have come out (87:28 - 87:32)
um we'll probably do the next episode of (87:30 - 87:34)
ISE will probably be the last episode (87:32 - 87:36)
spoiler free and then every episode (87:34 - 87:38)
going forward the game's been out for a (87:36 - 87:41)
month so you know if we bring up Corydon (87:38 - 87:44)
or uh iron hands or iron bundle or (87:41 - 87:47)
scream tail you know I'll I'll fair game (87:44 - 87:49)
after that (87:47 - 87:52)
that just brings up one last Point why (87:49 - 87:54)
do all the future versions have such bad (87:52 - 87:56)
names compared to the Past versions like (87:54 - 87:58)
I know they're all Iron something oh my (87:56 - 88:00)
word could you not have thought of some (87:58 - 88:02)
better names for the future ones I know (88:00 - 88:04)
it's not great yeah we get it you had (88:02 - 88:06)
one idea for the future and they're all (88:04 - 88:10)
robots the future is dystopian right the (88:06 - 88:12)
pets the past is Rich the future is (88:10 - 88:14)
dystopian this is the status none of (88:12 - 88:16)
them are gonna wear none of them are (88:14 - 88:19)
actually going to be made of iron though (88:16 - 88:19)
is iron bundle (88:20 - 88:24)
iron bundle is a great name and a great (88:24 - 88:31)
Pokemon I don't know Iron junkieless (88:27 - 88:31)
Iron Dragon this is really awesome it's (88:32 - 88:38)

um (89:00 - 89:03)

was the best way we could have done the (89:03 - 89:07)
series for an open world game (89:04 - 89:09)
um (89:07 - 89:09)
there'll always be more Pokemon games (89:09 - 89:12)
