what's up everyone welcome to the 260 third episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ and with me today I have will hey and then summertime has gotten here early if you're in the right part of the country hooray for hot 90-degree temperatures in April is it 90 by you it will be alright it's rainy here the good ol Wisconsin speaking of Wisconsin Logan's only been here once I feel like yeah no that's know twice but one time it wasn't to see you or anything all right L yeah it's true that's true that's true Logan's here hey hey you guys finally let me out of my cage in the corner so I could do a podcast on it super effective I'm very happy please don't put me back in a cage or do you have complaints about your cage it's not a nice enough cage no no sir no sir it's virus wages no my cage is fine we can we can downgrade you from the luxury ball to the premier ball or just the standard pokeball if that's what's necessary oh god no not again Logan's Logan's popularity was getting too popular on other podcasts that I produced so we had a rare item in ah there you go I've even like cultivated popularity and other podcasts so you don't produce could we're the king of all podcasts have them couldn't have them ramping ramping around with with I'm done with it yeah that was that was going nowhere we we have a show for you guys today we got a we got some news I wouldn't say it's it's the most noteworthy news but we got some news none the less we're going to get some of Logan's impressions on Pokemon Sun and Moon a game that no one seems to be talking about anymore very timely impressions yep right you know at the critical moment we're getting the best impressions and then we have some emails and our Pokemon of the week next week I we have an interview with Pat bear he is a comedian and a person on the Internet we're all people on the Internet someone said I actually saw that on the internet when he tweeted it and then you retweeted it yeah Pat loves Pokemon he like I said he's comedian he does a lot of panels at PAX and he he has a lot of connections so a really great interview very probably the most Pokemon interview then then okay so did you just leave out the most important part about him completely maybe maybe he's part of the upright citizens brigade what whoa okay I was a huge fan of Chegwin back in the day and I Wow chink penguin penguin he's part chicken part penguin his enemy is chunk part chicken part skunk if you don't know your internet history why are you even talking like - I've never heard of Cheng Qin versus chunk I used to have a chunk hoodie mm-hmm no no I well that's your your homework for the week kiddies look up up rights to the citizens brigade in qiangren unless I'm like completely confusing the guerrilla used to do Chegwin but I just sort of his thing on UCB comedy and yeah he's there so I mean I don't know I can't back you up about the ching one who knows Hey look I have no stakes and Cheng ones but I don't know where I was going with it shows a disaster now before we get into news before we go down our Pokemon bandwagon of happiness has anything new or exciting been happening in your lives that could waste 10 minutes and or I could talk about c2e2 or some other things I feel like I have a lot to say but I do like to give this time to you guys just in case there's like what burritos or something we need to talk about I haven't had any wet burritos I've stopped going to the gym I've started working longer hours at work and I'm plowing through bleach when I am the TV show oh okay I was gonna say you're just just chugging bleach just have it we figured out that you actually don't have to work out you just have to consume tons of bleach yeah and exactly it later no way goes calories yeah brain space I do this don't do not drink oh no don't drink bleach do not judge you will be impressed that I use bleach to clean my bathroom today but yeah now I bleached the TV show about the Soul Reapers and the spirit society and all that good is is bleach better than Digimon I already know the answers no well I mean it depends on what you're looking for bleach is really oriented towards that high school teenager crowd just like Hana may in general Kaname yeah you mean anime yeah the Hana may I mean Kaname for my preference I would choose bleach over Digimon but that's that's me I mean I like the the huge battles the big explosions the awesome power demonstrations which I mean you can I to get in the Digimon Digimon but you don't have a guy who's likely you killed my grandfather and I'm gonna pull this spirit arrow and shoot it through you and destroy you know half the city in doing so that kind of stuff do you wait there's there's way more cuteness and rolling in Digimon and that's true in it we're not we're talking about animes not video games Oh so these those criteria are only for video games yeah I know you know I love Death Note there is no cute there's no roll there's Jose I tried to get my mom to watch Death Note and she was like this is really dark I was like yes that's why it's good mm-hmm what I want to get back to a Digimon here but when I was at c2e2 let's tie this all together there was a lot of different anime all over the place I Irene is really into URI on ice have you guys seen that show no all right sounds very funny it's about me uh like a taters yeah and she's into the show called fresh snow uh it's about swimmers and free free yeah yes that's the Hana May I was thinking of okay it's not spelled with an H Hana me no but some of us are cultured we'll and we know the proper fancy yeah you're you're confusing it with thing that does start with H which I'm not going to speak of on this family oriented program but c2e2 is really great like I said lots of Hannam a lots of pok√©mon stuff this year there is a minute video on on our Facebook page facebook.com slash pkmn cast if you want to see some of the official and a lot of a lot of non official Pokemon stuff there's a really there's a couple derpy Pikachu's I found that were real heartwarming really little tease really good show this year though I got a a not not a good spot they put me on Sunday last show of the day on Sunday not I'm not the best spot in the world probably actually some would say the worst spot on a panel because most people are buying stuff and or going home on Sunday worse then opposite the Game of Thrones panel mmm I would still I would rather take a earlier spot in the day and compete with the Game of Thrones panel than to be the last spot of the day and compete with people wanting to just go home I think I mean yeah I don't think there's a ton of people that don't have an obvious choice for whether they're going to the Game of Thrones or the Pokemon thing you know like you're not gonna have a 8 year old showed up for the Game of Thrones panel all right well you are probably true but now the whole convention was actually really great I wouldn't say I've been sour on c2e2 but I've been going for you know seven years and the I can remember the first three years they were super fantastic and then you know four five and six I just felt like oh these are kind of the same vendors same thing not anything so exciting to the point where last year I think I was only on the show floor for an hour and a half and then we left after the panel where this year I was on the show floor for almost five hours and I felt like I could have been on the show floor for like another two hours and see more stuff there was a lot of new vendors even though it was in the same space same hall like same size there's just I don't know like different more things to see so it was really enjoyable this year there was about a hundred and thirty people that came out to the panel according to c2e2 so now not the biggest crowd I've pulled but still I just like this little gameshow mechanic which seem to go over really really well so I might do that in the future probably need a better way of calling on people though because there was a lot of uh a lot of hands going up and very hard to hear people so I'll probably have to rework that mechanic but overall I think the show on well there's a cut 30-minute version of it on on the feed so last week if you didn't see that but yeah whoo that was an all right show I mean the biggest problem was c2e2 is it's in Chicago if it was in any other town it would probably be much better what's wrong with Chicago there's played Alysha yeah and I wasn't impressed the one time I went I mean I had a nice time but not necessarily call my name to come on back there mmm got yells more my biggest thing about Chicago was like there's like right right now if I look out any of the windows of my house right now all I see is green leaves on trees I don't see any other buildings I don't see right that's all I see is leaves and stuff I don't think there's a single place in all of Chicago where if you don't look out your window you're not looking into somebody else's window it's all buildings and they're all buildings that are all next to each other and there's like one blade of grass somewhere in a glass case they're like oh yeah we got green I got that girl visited Oh me all right speaking of getting the green we got some Pokemon news oh wow these transitions are just the worst they're real sucker that just not just not on my a game today first bit of news here is Pokemon series XYZ complete collection to be released in Australia this will be in Australia we

best Pikachu one because it has the little banana exactly it's pretty adorable and there's no furoshiki excuse me yeah I've already talked about furoshiki on this program I oh I like the Rotom collection oh let me off this sight haha does that have to do with Klump Clank Chegwin and chunk yeah no all right they have a sweet Rotom play mat if you play TCG you know like Pokemon Trading Card Game the Rotom play matt is tops it looks so good the there is a cannon picture contest that is hosted by both Canon and Pokemon ah this is from Pokemon podcast calm the the most trusted site in Pokemon news I pulled this off canons Facebook page actually I don't think I don't know if Pokemon has somewhat announced this yet but Canon is hosting a Pokemon slash toy photo contest starting on May 1st using the hashtag toy travel take shots featuring your favorite toy while following the monthly theme first theme hasn't been announced it top photo will win a EOS m cake it with a Pikachu shoulder plush two runners-up will get Pokemon keychains for more information you can visit snapshots website or the pokemon branded snapshot page the contest will go from May to July so three chances to win and keep it on Pokemon podcast.com for news before pokemon calm has it right I'm not exactly I said I'm not it says from everything I read and research that this was open to everyone even the cannon video promoting it shows a bunch of teens scrambling to get pictures and they have like Charmander plushies or squirtle plushies or peach you and it says use any toy but the commercial is only featuring Pokemon and the prize is a cannon and a Pikachu plush like in a specific Pokemon branded box with cannons logo on it so those people look to be a little older than teens I don't know maybe like I don't wasn't no you mean mmm I was going 22 23 on there mmm I mean this their sport nice cameras yeah I mean if you have an SLR I mean I mean I had an SLR when I was a teenager it just wasn't a Canon did it stand for something else or is that single lens reflex I'd be like is this some kind of joke I don't get no it was the camera brand that everybody had that they don't make anymore my contacts Pentax okay oh there you go I don't know how reputable I know I saw this I saw the contest advertised on Facebook so it must be real yeah yeah no I'm talking about the next article uh-huh is it on Pokemon podcast comm no that's that's where I get all my Pokemon days yeah yeah yeah this is posting our slack community I'll just read the title here we'll go from there blogger Russian soul soul gaskey faces 3.5 years in prison for playing Pokemon go in a church Oh what do I read the article or do we move but I mean it sounds legitimate knowing how Russia is these days that's true me that's all so it's it's an article where clearly the headline is pretty much the whole it's like a trailer that shows you every plot point in the movie like everybody knows what that article is now that you've read the headline I hope I'll apologize for my butchering of Russian last names here mmm but Russian blogger Ruslan Sol scoffs key might be sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for playing Pokemon go in at church an act that was offensive to religious believers argued the persecution quote I may be an idiot by a but I am by no means an extremist end quote said school scoffs key in his final statement boy what a quote that's good quote again a long time ago people were in imprisoned in camps and for longer terms not for 3.5 years but for decades because they joked for example about communism and about Stalin now it turns out that they want to imprison me for 3.5 years in real terms because I obscenely joked about the Orthodox and the hand arc krill for me this is savagery and barbarism I do not understand how this is at all possible nevertheless as we seen it is quite possible indeed end quote schools gas ski is being accused of three offenses based on three articles of Russian criminal criminal code on inciting hatred or M&E offending religious believers and illegally bringing equipment for covert filming the blogger pleaded innocent to all three charges it seems like maybe the Pokemon go wasn't like the chief thing he did wrong here no it was I don't think so either I think it was the fact that he had a phone yeah was the problem yeah I'll skip some paragraphs here the final paragraph when scoffs key was search authorities also found that he was carrying a pen with a built-in camera during the trial the bloggers insisted that the pen does not belong to him he also stressed that the pen is equipted with a light bulb and not a camera which would make the device impossible for culverts shooting so visiting film I so part of this that we also left out I mean let me give you a Part A and A Part B Part A is in Russia the church the Orthodox Church is much more closely tied to the government and much more protected than we would have that here in the States and they have a lot of influence on the government and other people have been arrested and imprisoned for speaking out against the church in Russia as I also to give you a part a dot to one I don't know I have to drive past the Russian embassy to get to work every day so anytime anything happens in Russia I have to drive through that protest I wish you people would stop or like a different block because it slows down my commute to and from work every time Part B the dude is in activist atheist it appears at least some people are reporting it that way so it's kind of like he was possibly speaking out against the Orthodox Church and just using pokeymon go as the sort of you think it was coming where like I wasn't filming I was just playing Pokemon go right yeah I think Pokemon go is at best a bit player in this poem I go is the bait that we took to report yeah yes exactly but but also it's it's the method of protest and saying like oh you know why are you arresting me just because I'm playing a game in a church right it's not harming the church or anything like that and sort of like saying the response is too extreme for the action that was taken it's like if you get arrested for playing Pokemon go and in Milwaukee public park which I give you in six months that's going to happen then you're gonna say right it not necessarily like oh you were really out there to play pokemon go but it's just to prove the point if look how ridiculous i just got 10 years in the Milwaukee prisons because I was playing Pokemon go at a park very excited for my future of getting arrested for playing Pokemon go hey honey park when I was a kid I always wanted to go to prison because it's like free food you just hang out with dudes and have fun right on climb you clang in bang I would assume yeah and you don't have to work I can get ripped you like you know get some abs in there yep don't have to worry about paying rent or your electric I probably prison is not great so yeah that did two things to learn from today's program don't drink bleach don't go to prison don't don't intentionally put yourself in prison perfect speaking of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County Parks you know they're just the best I recently went down to Lake Park to get you guys some grade-a reporting so two things that is men on the street Bev I used my legs and I I got the first-hand look at Lake Park which is the main park that was focused in all the Milwaukee regulations slash rules slash laws whatever they decided to pass that don't actually do anything because at no point is somebody is a police officer gonna stop you in a park and ask you if you're playing Pokemon go just that's never going to happen I'm sure I won't say that it will probably happen but they have no way of actually like taking your phone and looking at it and being like oh now I guess guess you're just snapchatting I'm sorry continue on with your thanks Steve you just got snapchatting banned from the Milwaukee public park so you know they listen to us yeah they're they're hot on our heels they're right now considering drinking a gallon of bleach from the first day of our show this is the after-effects of being the most trusted source for Pokemon news right who else is going to report on Russians playing Pokemon go alright so the two things the first thing is that the probably the most popular part at Lake Park is called the waterfall area and what makes that so popular is there's three polka stops touching each other so a lot of people would sit down at the waterfall area and they wouldn't have to move because there was just three stops there people would lure them up you know you would sit there for hours every five minutes you got three spins tons of pokemon coming to you from reports that I cannot verify but for multiple people one of those polka stops got removed during this whole fiasco what I went there on Fri what is today I went there less than a week ago the third one was back oh so there's also a fancy restaurant down there called the Lake Park Bistro and there was two polka stops near there then there was the parking lot that everyone parked in and that's also where some of the complaints came in that parking lot is for the park but it is also for that restaurant Lake Park Bistro and Lake Park Bistro is your your one of your five-star restaurants in Milwaukee you know you're paying 50 to $100 a plate of food that might not be expensive to some people that might be outrageous to other people what doesn't matter is just a fancy restaurant some of the complaints where not only does that parking lot get filled but if you're going to Lake Park for your you know amazing dinner it's impossible to find a parking spot so I parked in that parking parked in that lot which is you know anyone parked there the two pokey stops by Lake Park Bistro they were up three by the water the waterfall were up and I didn't go any further past the waterfall there's a lighthouse there's a bridge and then there's a long open area where all the rich houses start to appear I didn't go past that area just because I was short on time but the other point it looks like at least one poke stop is back the other point is at after 10:00 p.m. and I don't know the exact time because I got there at 10:10 I was told that poky stops and Jim's closed at 10:00 p.m. so I got there at 10:10 sure enough the pokey stops were a different color they were a different shade of blue and they were closed so when you want to go spin it it said this stop is currently closed so I don't know if they're doing that in any other areas or if it's just like a Milwaukee thing but I've never heard of a pony stop her pokemon gym closing yes so weird so the gym how the gym looks is you know how like the Pokemon it's always a dragon knight or Garros or so you see the dragon I have a gyarados rotate on the gym when a gym is closed it's just a darker shade of blue and nothing is rotating on the top huh again what does Milwaukee Parks is going to do if somebody's playing pokemon go I will say that I think the closing of the stops I think that's acceptable and I think that's fine because legally parks closed at 10:00 p.m. and they open I think it at 5:00 a.m. or 6 a.m. your revolts your results may vary depending on what part of the country and not all parks closed at 10:00 okay every Milwaukee County park closes at 10:00 I think most Waukesha County parks also closed at 10:00 so the problem is you have a bunch of kids teenagers and adults in the park at 11:00 yeah you can send a police officer to you know tell them to go home and and every time that happened at Lake Park the plea the people would go home I mean no one's gonna be like but officer this lawyer is gonna last for 14 minutes so they just leave but if the solution - okay it's getting too expensive to send police officers out just to tell people to go home hany antic can you just close these at 10:00 that will you know naturally let people go home and solve one of the issues I behave Ian if you could if that's if you consider people being in the park after 10:00 an issue that at least solves it in a reasonable manner I don't know it's hard for me to be upset to be like oh this is ridiculous that these stops closed at 10:00 when in fact the park closes at 10:00 hmm I mean I can't argue with you there I just think 10 is awfully late for a park to be open I mean what are you gonna do in a park at 10 o'clock at night go home watch TV here's some YouTube videos Washington oh my oh so that's your that's your firsthand report on Lake Park ala as the weather gets nicer I will be I I'm going to be going back there just to see if if there are still people playing Pokemon go and see if anything really changes obviously the game styles popular as it once but has been but I would still just be curious last bit of news here is new a lowland theme stages a new pok√©mon that hail from the lowland region are now available in Pokemon shuffle a free puzzle game that is available on the 3ds family of systems as well as mobile devices for a limited time special stages will provide a chance to get a Lobos first partner Pokemon play Litton and special stages until May 9th populo and special stages from May 9th to May 23rd and Rowlett from May 23rd - June 6 to capture these cool Pokemon be sure to log in between May 2nd and May 30th to get your special gift a lowland Vulpix will join your cult collection hmm Logan you on that shuffle grind that was good just gonna say I've been so off that shuffle grind for so long but you were on it yeah for a while it's a fun game it is really great where are you spelling that yeah now I shuffled until I started givin them money and I'd said time to step away that's what broke me too I felt like I gave that so I played shuffles probably my third most played game on the 3ds it's like Animal Crossing Monster Hunter 3 you Pokemon shuffle and I think Pokemon shuffle might have moved up to number 2 I played the game for 98 hours or whatever free and then I felt compelled enough to go okay I'll give you $25 most 3ds games are $39 I'll give you 25 I feel really good about this experience I've had a lot of enjoyment in this game and like as soon as I gave them $25 like 2 weeks later I just fell off it like broke it broke the habit I feel like well for me it was like I I gave them money and it's like I didn't win anymore any more than before I had given the money and I was like well then where's the what did I get from my money except more time playing this game when I could be breathing fresh air or Pokemon Rumble blast it's so like it's a very tough thing to get a microtransactions correct in a mobile game I feel like it's like you have to have incentive enough to help you in the game so you feel like something happened but not so much so that you just obliterate the game after it's done I think it's a tricky wire to walk and I don't think many companies get it right this is kind of an offshoot but because you guys on that Fire Emblem Heroes I fell off of that and I was really really close to giving it money and I didn't and I good job I feel really good about that yeah yeah I mean the thing is like I love that game and I love playing that game but when you ooh you could pay like $40 and you get a total of 10 new animate babies and Hannam a babies yes yes oh yeah sorry uh we used to be friends dude at least you and I have stuff in common that all SBJ does not you gotta side with the right team look I'm on your team for like 90% of thing we used to be friends do you not notice my past tense in that previous statement well this is the last of so look it's gonna be anyway the the children you you buy with with real money and firing them cost so much money it's a dick ulis like the free like you could just get them for free five at a time per week basically or you could pay like $40 to get an additional five it just doesn't it doesn't make any sense wait that's $8 per character yes that's what they want you yes it is achromatic expensive that is two Starbucks venti lattes that react just about and and I didn't throw this in but those characters are not gonna be good like maybe one of the five that you get maybe will be good yeah do they have shinies do they have Chinese anime babies if I'm gonna just be brainwashed yes Stockholm Syndrome dear yes do that they don't have any Chinese they have they have five stars which give you a little potentially sometimes five star plus isn't that a thing if you have two of the same five star unit you can have one of them eat the other one and then the it gets a plus on it which means that two of its stats are higher and then one can have comes out of its pok√©ball it does a little sparkle but eating ding ding ding like now unfortunately it just has a plus next to its name that's all I will never understand Fire Emblem it's like super Chiss well I love it if when they pop out of their pokeball it doesn't do a special little ding ding ding ding into those stars Mountain hmm well I mean if you get one of the like famous ones that are on the then it plays your little video we're so out famous to whom I had to never too late a foreign game in my life that I would yeah I would no one character from Bob the Builder well basically it's all hmm yeah Bob the Builder yeah you wouldn't know Bob the Builder if you saw him I know but I'm 44 years old Bob the Builder was like literally came out when I was like 33 no yeah but like clearly you know Bob the Builder right you know him so I feel like you know if it was the guy he's just like a very generic builder man all right I wouldn't know one of the fire emblem candid characters from hon taro I don't know who that is so I know I can talk about Stern hi hey taro I love Hamtaro good goodness go back to mobile games I think Logan Logan is right in the fact that like Fire Emblem Pokemon shuffle I'll even throw a clash Royale in there because I'm still playing that you're paying to accelerate your process in the game but you feel you're not getting anything from it except more game yeah like you'll eventually get there without the money like in clash Royale if I give them $20 and I use use that money to upgrade my cards yeah I might win one or two matches because I have better cards than people but then all of a sudden I hit I hit the area where all the all the people that did exactly what I did are not sitting here they did the same thing I did they paid a bunch of money their cards are over leveled and now we're all in the same area competing whereas if I don't pay money and I just suffer through facing those people who paid money at least I feel two things I feel that I didn't spend the money and also if I beat them I'm a better player because I had I had the disadvantage the entire match so I feel good there of okay you had over power cards you have the advantage yet I still won that's a good feeling hmm I think we're cosmetic or we're microtransactions work the best in these these games are chests like cosmetics like in Final Fantasy 14 the only thing they sell is is cosmetics so it's it's like oh do you want this new emote it's $7 don't it gives you zero advantage of the game you're not accelerating past anyone you're not getting any money you're it's literally just an emote or it's literally just a chocobo mount or it's just a flying dragon none of these give you any advantage whatsoever if you want them great and I'm sure they make a ton of money off though and if you don't you're not missing out yeah it's like a little custom thing you can that tailor it towards what you think is the coolest looking but it doesn't actually give you an advantage but it does give you that like like that feel good at least to me it gives me that that feel a good moment we're putting $25 in shuffle I thought I would get that but I didn't hmm of like have having a red flying dragon and everyone and like people in Tallinn oh that dragons so cool and it's like ya know spent $12.99 on this dragon most of the time if I put money into a game it's because I really have enjoyed the game and I feel like the developer deserves to get some of my money you know like not necessarily for whatever the purchase is but just for the fact that I've had a ton of enjoyment from it and yeah it's like a way of tipping yeah and that's a perfect example of tipping because you you get something that everybody can see like oh they support the game it's not it doesn't make you like better than it rails or give you the illusion that you are it's just just cool I'd rather they just show me advertisements right that way I'm not even kidding I'm so good at ignoring advertisements I just show me ads make your money that way let me play my game I'm very impatient I don't want any of those different patient - I will pay like the 399 to get rid of all ads just the speed up my experience 20 seconds me too all right well that's all our news what we'll do is we'll take a quick break and when we come back we'll do some emails Logan will give us some impressions on Sun and Moon even though they're late and we will do our Pokemon of the week gonna leave us a review on iTunes that would be much appreciated otherwise otherwise it's super it's super and we are back from our break let's let's just toss it over to Logan here and and get your impressions on Sun and Moon I know it's been a while I know you took a bunch of notes yeah but don't don't give me any fat give me the lean give me the leading stuff I mean at this point any impressions are way late but this is the first time I ever bought both versions of a Pokemon game so I did look chemical digital what I hope I saw our judges it's true yeah I don't want that taking up shelf space my house no it's just it's just imaginary but um yeah I actually bought both versions and I really enjoyed this game I think it's I'm pretty confident in saying this is my favorite generation of Pokemon and this is you know months out so I feel better about saying that without the you know like the new effect wearing off yeah so that's that's my high praise of the game I brought both versions for first time I also love you know they like the little tauros circling thing is a much better way to hatch eggs there's like quality of life improvements the bottle caps make it so you know off to soft reset for Legendary's which is awesome like everybody sort of has the option to use a legendary on their competitive team if they want to which is a really great nature though no but you can I mean that you can influence with like synchronize or whatever oh right yeah so it does it still takes time and you still have to get them up to level 100 but there's it's just way less time investment than soft resetting which was awful like I don't I mean I don't think anybody wanted to soft reset and I certainly don't think that was the intended method that the Pokemon company wanted you to use to catch your Pokemon and then use them in battle so I'm glad that they they have an answer for that I also love that there's training that you can just leave them in there I think this happened in black and white to where you could just leave them in a daycare situation and have level up over the course of days but I didn't play black and white - that's like the one game that I didn't play much choice smartness yeah maybe I'll go back sometime and play it but but it's just I don't know I didn't I black and white was my least favorite generation I I think it was just the time in my life that I was least excited about Pokemon is really what happened it didn't it doesn't reflect super on the game just like my mentality at the time and then I never picked up by can why - so yeah that's fine you do you but did you what what were your thoughts on the the Elite Four I I mean I thought okay so I thought it was fine and then I heard the episode where we'll was talking about how it's this gentrification and that made me feel complicated about it cultural appropriation not gentrification let's get our social justice terms a perfectly correct wait it's not oh I guess it Kukui is culturally appropriating from Regents or whatever I'm just feeling like like he's having like the professional golf player move in and be the most important person on the island and all that stuff I I don't know I think both terms work but yeah you probably yeah probably said cultural appropriation but it's not even so I mean just that it's like Kaku he's not Kaku he's trying to toss away what makes a Lola so special and it felt very like at the end it was pretty much the same as every Pokemon game where all the rest of the parts felt really fresh you know what else would you want at an end of a game I feel like the Elite Four is a is more memorable not so much as hmm and you've just been brainwashed no okay so you have six you have seven generations of games six generations have gyms and people were people remember specific gyms and they remember that there's eight gyms altogether but I but those aren't events in themselves like the Elite Four is where you let me let me posit an alternative right what if instead of the Elite Four they had done it where you have to do a series of totem Pokemon maybe not for maybe five totem Pokemon that act like even stronger than the totem pole I had to fight in the actual trials and they were like all right you know this is similar to what other cultures do but this is our version of it and it's totem Pokemon it's not gym leaders and you know they're gonna call out support pokemon and it'll be based on SOS battles and things like that and you know give you a different experience that is just as good but just different yeah I I don't think I mean the Elite Four is a staple but I don't think it needs to be in every game and I like that was a good idea and also like it's not our responsibility to come up with the cool new stuff exactly oh if they want to hire me I'm I'm available my point was only being that when you say you did the Elite Four and you conveyed that to somebody to instantly know what you mean whereas if I was to say hey in generation 5 I just finished the sixth gym I've I've no clue who that was or what Pokemon they had I'm pretty sure that was Scylla I thought Scala was the fifth gym that was the electric one wasn't it uh well anyway I don't have my like like V elite for is it like you you're not you don't know any details about any of the elite fours and the other games right I mean again so much is like if if a gym leader stands out to you then you'll remember that's their badge or whatever yeah same as if an Elite Four member is memorable they're just for more gym leaders just in a row whereas like I think forever everyone will be like the fire trial you know like that's crazy and super funny it's super memorable for the not just the the person who put you through the trial but for the trial itself which cannot be said about any gym battle except for that miltank I guess but that was just like frustrating but it's the same every other gym is exactly the same it's just I fought my pokemon against their pokemon and it was a fight but in you know Lola stuff happens you know like the you have to spot the difference in the images or go find ingredients to this potion we're making and that's all part of a a very a very memorable experience that yeah very different from what we've had before and I just like back to the topic I just don't think that like the Elite Four was exactly the same as it's always been just for gym leaders in a row I don't I think that was like the least strong new thing but it was still part of the book mob formula that I loved so I wasn't mad at it sure what were your thoughts on the the story they tried to tell I thought it was really good like I was it was a compelling story and I don't know that I've ever really been taken by a story I love the the oh god I've forgotten her name Lily so Lily yeah I love it Lily at the beginning of the game is not wearing clothes that she likes she's not very competent in herself or her abilities and then by the end of the game she's really grown and changed and taking on her mom and still I don't know if there's there's tons of great things that are happening with Lily it's another one of those Pokemon stories where it's not really about you it's about someone else I also felt very like my character except for his cold dead eyes and that robotic smile but I was interacting with the world and learning things about a Lola and introducing myself to people and that felt like my story even though the the overarching like world stories about lily confronting your mom that make sense yeah yeah I think so um why did you complete your a lowland pokedex yeah I've got I have a living Dex so I with or without connecting to Pokemon bank yeah I completed it connecting to put my baby yeah why would you do all the work you got the Pokemon so I'm still like I'm literally still working on my lowland pokedex and I will not connect my copy of moon to Pokemon bank until I have a not living but just to complete a lowland pokedex mm-hmm um built within moon completely and and it's just the SOS battles are killing me yeah I mean I I think that's cool that's like really extending the life of your game for you but I just connect as soon as I could um that's said like you still have the SOS battle for amorini boy that was not the most fun thing but it was kind of fun to figure out what you're supposed to do yeah I think that took me about two hours yeah I mean you can you can set it up where you have somebody to check if it's the right kind of Marini and all that stuff because I wanted to get one with the hidden ability and all that and that's that's too much well if you want a hidden ability Marini I've got a bunch of them actually I I gave some away on the the slack channel the trading slack channel a while back yeah that's my I have friends friends are for hidden abilities right but right I'll get X completion on my own that's cool I like my pocus completion like my scratching that itch section is my living decks so I I don't know if that that is a thing I'm already doing so I didn't feel like I had to wait to connect it yeah I may do that next my after I finish with the Pokedex in moon I'm going to breed my own like this is the fun team I want to go through son with mm-hmm place on and and connect that to Pokemon bang oh that would be cool yeah that'll be just like a fun play through and it's like oh I've already got a level 100 Volcarona hey I'm going to the the first trial with could get at my level okay so speaking of making teams I like I made I am I always for less like three generations I've been really into competitive battling and so I did all the research and made like my team and I'm really excited about them also they've never none of them have ever experienced a pokemon battle and I love that they're just precious babies um because they were all on the the Isle of fun and I level up and all that stuff where you haha they've never gone into battle so you had it you have a competitive team of Pokemon they have never battled correct that's amazing that's amazing so yeah they and they never will experience battle either because I didn't like I didn't look at the dates for regionals until after I had my team like ready to go and uh they had already passed any of the ones that were nearby me so we can come to the Virginia regionals if that yeah and yet maybe maybe I will because I do want to use this team they're all named after sodas so I love that that's incredible mr. pepper no no there's no no no D pepper is already that's already a thing but I've got are see the goal duck a diet the pelipper baja blast the car tanah gamer fuel the tempo cocoa zero the croc krookodile and then cherry the marowak it's a little in marowak Wow now you've just given away your strategy team so everybody's gonna beat you at Regionals now spoiler alert my strategy is just like adapted from many many top-tier strategies that you can find online easily alright with that being said let's jump into some emails you have any emails for us you can send them to SB j at pkmn cast calm SB j @p k m and c AST calm or you can go over to pokemon podcast and hit that contact button both will get you there we we're getting we're getting this backlog email and and we have quite a bit of good ones so we'll get to yours I promise now first one is from Sean writes in and says hey s PJ and crew I'm writing because I wanted to give a shout out to will for disclosing his PTSD diagnosis in last episode when my own diagnoses got a lot worse this year I recently I was really terrified but knowing that other people are going through the same have gone through the same or similar things gives me hope y'all's podcast has been a great tool for getting me through panic and racing thoughts for the last few months and has gotten me back into Pokemon letter writing and other things I love my question for you do you have a favorite type of regular trainer in the games I am a fan of furo see the girl from X&Y probably because their music was great and training against a bunch of high level audino's is even better PS I am breaking the rule saying Nick is my favorite best Sean act sm h on slack now nick being the gentleman who does all our wonderful music woo i he's my favorite too yeah he's pretty good do you want to address the PTSD i i have not gone through that but oh i didn't it's just right i don't think it's a surprise maybe it is a surprise to people that i I do see a therapist twice a week I don't know if I've ever mentioned that before but I've been I mean I know that yeah yeah you mentioned it on Twitter but I don't know if you oh yeah because I complain about how much it cost me but I've been doing it for seven years i but yeah my whole philosophy is right that I'm not ashamed of my diagnosis because I'm not the person that caused it so there's no reason for me not to say that I have a diagnosis because it's nothing to be ashamed of and it's something I'm working on and getting help with so yeah I didn't I didn't know that when you when you set it on the episode a couple weeks ago and I mean that you know I'm always I'm always glad to hear people talking about mental health and not having a stigma about anything yeah and I mean I have two diagnoses that I work with PTSD and just tie me up um neither one is particularly exciting I also go to see a therapist um though yeah it's it's helpful if everybody should should try that a couple times in their life it's helpful a comprar I think it could be helpful for anyone to go see a therapist oh I do yeah I think so too even if it's just to go in and say you know what you're doing fine yeah yeah awesome awesome advice the follow-up Shawn's question do you have a hero type of regular trainer in the game hiker of course wow I'm not even surprised I liked the veteran trainer design from black and white and I actually bought one of those like a Kangol that looks like the veteran trainer hat from black and white oh I would say that I like the pokey parents the people with the little kid and the Pikachu outfit yeah I don't know they're just kind of like warms my heart when I see them that's gonna be you someday I hope so oh I mean I'm against having kids so but whatever you have that help yeah uncle hopefully future uncle will oh that's adorable how can you be against children like that I'm already an uncle well I've got three two nieces and a nephew so it's not in the future the future is now thanks to science ah uh you just made a wrestling reference by the way ah no I actually made a reference to the Pokemon cartoon the future is now that is what Clement always says when he brings out one of his inventions all right he must be a Seth Rollins fan a will writes in from Soma Hawk Illinois I don't know where that is or how to say that city hi I am a huge fan of the show always love listening to the various takes you all provide I don't have a favorite as I think each of you bring your own thing to the table anyways my question is more of an idea that I'd like your thoughts and opinions on when you google fan made Pokemon you get tons of different designs and renders and a lot of them are really cool looking it seems in past generations Pokemon designs Sun and Moon weren't really that great in terms of the way they look only speaking from personal opinion here and to me there were quite a few that didn't look aesthetically pleasing it just seems that Pokemon can capitalize on the ingenuity of fans and maybe do a contest of sorts they release a new generation where they take the best 100 submitted designs for Pokemon or however many and slowly roll out the winners as the game release approaches the designer could submit an evolutionary line chain of Pokemon or a single non evolutionary Pokemon if they choose to do so however the contest would simply be pure design and in no way would the designers have say in what they would evolve into or what moves they could learn that could be up to Game Freak for balance reasons it goes on about the rules a little bit I'm sure fans would be willing to accept that it would be cool enough to have Pokemon or evolutionary chains of Pokemon you actually design in the games anyway sorry for the long email I just would like to hear your thoughts on that idea so I you know I play card fight Vanguard and Buescher Road which is the company that owns New Japan Pro Wrestling and card fight Vanguard every year they have a contest a design a card contest and they'll have like a junior winner and a like masters or adult winner and they actually make the cards that people design there they're never good cards there never are cards that you'd actually play with her I mean it would be a fluke if they were but it's just really cool because people submit designs you know for what they would want to see as a character on a card and then it gets actually made into a card so I I'm totally for that I think that would be a really cool just because there are so many people like so many artists and artistic people like Logan who could design really cool Pokemon that we just it would be a feast for us all to enjoy and then one person would win and be a really awesome Pokemon in the game for all time I am strictly against this but I don't know if Logan has an opinion okay I'm of two minds one is I love outsourcing like it to the fans to design Pokemon because there's lots of people who have lots of great ideas but also I really don't like contests where everybody has to put in a ton of work designing something and then only one person wins so it's like they like a ton of people put in a ton of work and only one person gets credit YUM that's the worst yeah is it really it is I just think that this your empty about your devaluing your skills yeah like to saving your skills like to say that I'm I'm an artist and I'm going to do what could be 10 to 12 hours of work for that not to be recognized in any way but somebody will be recognized and they will get no right there that they're their reward is going to be that their thing gets into the game but that their their reward is exposure yeah and exposure best right I I don't know what world you guys live in but there are literally hundreds if not thousands of people out there who are making Pokemon designs of random fake Pokemon for zero dollars and zero recognition so they're already doing this for their own pleasure and enjoyment just turn it into a contest it's gonna happen whether it's a contest or not here's here's my thoughts of it because yeah you're right at some point like most of the time they're making fake Pokemon though because that's what they enjoy doing like I enjoy I enjoy making stuff for Pokemon podcasts whether that's a new logo or new artwork or or whatnot but when somebody else asks me to do something like hey can you make me a logo that's where I want some Mota like I want something in compensation preferably money because getting a shout-out on Twitter doesn't really do anything for me that's that would that would be worth my time here's why I wouldn't want anything like this is because you can say that these fake Pokemon look cool or these real Pokemon don't look cool but Pokemon is so much more than just the design just the moveset just the abilities Pokemon are designed in a way to last the tests of time yeah something like a Kuna or a Beedrill or a cloister you might not think are the coolest design Pokemon but those designs have held up for over 20 years when people see a Beedrill they instantly know that it's a Beedrill and I'm not saying that these artists aren't talented and they can't come up with something but there are so many references in so much history and and so much more than just a design that goes into Pokemon something as simple as like ditto ditto is a word in the dictionary that means like to copy enlightenment the name is just as important as ya as Ben Zion as it makes into the world I mean you look at something like bouffalant tauros and you go oh Toro should evolve them to muffle it and it doesn't and I think I think that's totally okay because there are definitely species of animals that exist that they while they might look the same they aren't related and I think that makes sense in making the Pokemon world feel more believable and when you have a core set of artists in a core group working together and ensuring that consistency when you do a contest of everyone draw your coolest Pokemon design and we're gonna base that off of how cool that design and that has nothing to do with the name that has nothing to do how it fits in the world that has nothing to do with longevity you are easy I made you've made rules for this contest that don't exist what if it's the same piece team of people who are working on Pokemon designs who are like we're gonna pick which design we want to include and then it's like whichever one comes most close to our style that one wins but the latest it validated everything you said know that it doesn't because what do you do what do you do with that design like how do you decide to name it how do you set it is so important for Pokemon and there's another question kind of related to this to protect their franchise as as strong as possible and once you open that up to other artists of like oh these 823 Pokemon were designed by people that work for the Pokemon company and this one wasn't theirs it just breaks that that mold of pretty much 21 years of legacy you don't see like a Zelda game have what one fan-made thing just sitting in the corner I think we could find a compromise a middle ground on this somewhere yeah I I just don't want to be a contest that's all it's my I go like what this is just because you young I'm gonna loop you in with the rest of them Logan and Millennials Jessica don't like to compete you don't let me want to live in a cutthroat world where one person is the clear winner and the arrests of everybody else is dead okay so what like I didn't hear anything you said pets Millennials because I stopped listening haha what okay so you have a contest let's let's look at this as a as a company thing why would a company ever do a contest the reason would be to get their name out there Pokemon in no way needs to get their name out there they have they get zero benefit of people retweeting or sharing or hosting some kind of contest when all they need to do is easily show one or two new Pokemon that they designed and they will instantly get mainstream media they will instantly get what they are looking for they don't need a contest to do that on top of that they don't need to take thousands of people and make them all feel terrible that their design didn't win and then take one person and say their design one for again what benefit is that company getting they are getting a design that they will now have to shoehorn into their game because they must pick a winner what if all a thousand designs are terrible what if the contest is you submit some Pokemon designs and then we'll invite you to come with our team and work with our team to design a pokemon so then they're not shoehorning in but you've still got a contest what's wrong with having a contest that's like a good we'll just like I will look audience participation that's good like trying to make money and it doesn't have to always got it got ours are only for like self-promotion and getting your name out there and Pokemon is in no way to need to do you see moose in they made 800 designs I think they've got I think they've they've mastered how to show off Pokemon that set such a cynical viewpoint that's so dark that the that sonically is you're gonna make $1 you're gonna miss your guy too easily waste thousands of people's time for putting in as like the most work that they can possibly do to find out that they're not picked there's nothing of there's nothing more disappointing to an artist to or anyone in a creative field of work to do 10 to 12 hours if not more work to like know that I'm not going to get a response no one's going to see this I'm not going to say I'm not going to get a thanks but no thanks you're not going to get anything because no company is going to email thousands of people but one and say sorry no thanks you know that 15 hours of work better luck next time hey guess what we're not doing it next time like so so all those people out there on deviantART who are spending hours and hours and posting things up there just for one person to click a like button that's somehow different yeah it's entirely different they've absolutely different they chose to do that that's what they're doing and so but you're choosing to enter the contest and it should be the joy of creating art it's not the a very you know it's not a job in turn the music contest I don't know when it's for a corporation I think the waters get muddy like there it's not just the joy of creating art it's you're making a product that it's going to make the corporation money so so you're telling me all of those bands who sing for Eurovision the except for the one band that wins at all that as well I can't believe I just wasted the past months of my life putting together this performance or do I have the joy of having different not your average the difference there is they're on TV right that is that is for real some exposure and also I'm I would wager they are paid so Pokemon company puts the best designs on the website and says okay here's the top 50 design no no no no colors that's just exposure $10 is a joke 10 like to be like here's $10 okay it's two lattes no that's a jungle days a lot on top of the fact that you want people to vote when we already know designs like Charizard designs like Lucario and designs like Pikachu are them the number one poke like Pokemon in the world and you want people that love those three Pokemon to vote no absolutely not wait no I didn't say vote when did I say vote you set the designs up on the website and have people vote no that's not what I said I just said put the best designs on the website so that's exposure for people that's the same thing and the other problem with putting the best designs on the website is now you're now you're you're showing off people's work and again exposure means nothing it is the worst you're showing off people's work and you're getting your you're making more people upset because you're going to have all these people looking at these Pokemon and then complaining to the Pokemon company why they picked a over B or Y C was it wasn't picked or why Pokemon D looks terrible but somehow made it with the other three pokemon like that is is just a marketing nightmare well I'm sorry the Pokemon company gets complaints every time they announce new Pokemon anyways cuz it's always like well this one looks like a Digimon it doesn't look like a Pokemon anymore blah blah blah anger anger anger and you're so silly against littell you live in a world I know joy come on still look good they still hold that I'm so sad we're still talking about this I just because a what's we're in a bizarre world where I'm arguing from the point of view of just like the joy of creation is the joy in itself and Steve's in this dark cynical place of like the job is not for the dollars for a billion-dollar company is a totally different conversation than a joy of me making art on a Saturday night for my deviantart end of story there's like no comparison there yes it's it's like I'd be doing it anyways and now I'm doing it for a potential opportunity which means it is no longer just a potential opportunity you apply at gamefreak or the Pokemon company you get a job and you get paid for it you'll never get that job this is why we need the philosopher on this program to let us know what philosophy informs us Travis come back I let me out of my cage just to fight with me next question here is from Ray hello team usual comments about greatness here I would I would like to talk about one thing that everyone likes to talk about race I love the race conversation that took place during the san playthrough Sun and Moon plate I was like who's Sam the Sun and Moon play through episodes and would love to have the thoughts on spj and crew for the following issue boy we went into one hot topic into the next here as race rate as race relation is perdant to mention that I am a white male married to a black female when I go out we are asked over half the time if we are splitting the check as though it's not clear that my wife and I are together my simple question how often are you asked if you are splitting the check when in your mind it is clear that you are on a date what do you think why do you think some people are asked this more often than others also will is the best an ammonite is the worst thank you Ray I have I have a different story others say I Logan I'm sure you have something related to this it's related to this topic of the checks being presented to people as to sir anyway last night me and my boyfriend Billy were eating at a restaurant it's just us just two people and the the guy comes over and offers us two checks and not only that but he has like a pink pen he's like oh I won't I won't give you a pink pen and I was just like what why what why not also it's just one check and I don't let me get that pink pen let me can I can I get that pink pen I really like pink I I don't know that's a similar situation I don't I just think it's funny in that situation the the topic of race like uh we should probably get Irene back on so we can have a person of color to talk about that because it's really yeah we're about the three whitest dudes you could get yeah I I mean I haven't really experienced problems with that I know those problems exist of like oh this white dude in this black chick are they together or they not together I get I don't really I have never really seen that in a restaurant most of the like I'm in a restaurant with couples anyway so it's always I maybe it's just a Wisconsin thing where they just assume that if it's any amount of people at a table we're gonna put it all on one check even though it's clear that we're all 20-somethings that are you know not family at all and org is clearly that these are a group of friends but we're going to put it all in the same check anyways that's like Wisconsin restaurant see if they like specifically ask hey can you split this like to here to there but I definitely like yet looks some of the times and that's from like both ends of the spectrum whether it's like white people judging me that I'm with a black girl or black people judging her that she's with a white dude and it's it's whatever it's just like it's what Logan said it's more funny than anything to be like okay yep this is still the world we live in all right Rachel what a shame my parents are like some of the most racist people ever and it was that was probably the hardest thing to overcome was I remember Irene and I were dating for probably three to four months before I told my mom and my mom was like instantly disgusted and like very unhappy that she considered it a Mira Belling against them to be dating a non-white person and then it was like this slow kind of roll out to like she finally met Irene and then kind of had more conversations with Irene and you know when I showed up Irene would be there and so they were kind of forced to talk and my mom did like a complete 180 and she loves Irene now she Texas Irene more than she taxes me she go shopping with just Irene like they go to Six Flags all all the time in the summer together like she is just the other day she was like when are you when are you and Irene getting married oh she is so she just loves Irene so much and like that was awesome to see and I like it for me it was a little bit it was easy to forgive her mom you used to be really racist and now you're not and so it's hard for me to be mad because like she changed like she took in a time to get to know Irene and by getting to know Irene like she opened up to like more you know black people outside of Irene and like that was really good to see but my dad on the other hand still pretty racist still likes to drop words that should not be said but he does like Irene but that was that was even even harder battling my dad's a lost cause haha nobody's lost cause till they're dead sir ugly sooner than later for the amount the amount of where he is at with his health bottle boy huh yeah I I'm never dating again I don't date now and I'm never going to ever again so the dating question is not a concern for me no one's a lost cause until they're dead will Wow I didn't say his lost cause I was a choice I've made uh but I would say so my one input I have on discussion of race and I think I brought this up to Steve before um and it's really kind of been something I've noticed as I travel more to go and hang out with Steve and do Pokemon events and things like that is little isn't the worst no living in Washington DC and like living on the East Coast the majority of my life I see people of color all the time everywhere I go you know everything just like you know there's no part of the city I go to nothing I do in my day where I'm not interacting with people of color but then I'll go to places like Milwaukee and I'll go to places like Indianapolis and it's like I don't see any people of color in the parts of the towns that I go to and it's just so striking to me like to go to the grocery store and have everybody in the grocery store be white that's not my experience here in DC and that that's when it becomes noticeable to me that in different parts of the country they're not having that diverse experience that I just live with in my day-to-day you know that's it here's to hoping more people have more diverse experiences and come to an understanding like Steve's mom did yeah there's anything that my mom's done right the last five years it was like come around on racial tension whoo this is so heavy this Pokemon podcast is real heavy here we go here's a lighthearted one this message is from Michael alala spj and crew I would like to know what your favorite songs from the Pokemon anime is and not any of the openings but the but the cheap knockoffs like NSYNC or Lizzie McGuire soundings sounding like songs from the official soundtracks all of them are heart Garbo but I really have a soft spot for my best friends from Pikachu's jukebox any of you own any of the CDs like to be a master anyways keep doing the awesome things you are doing you all are awesome best regards Michael uh yeah I had to be a master of course I did I had the soundtrack to the first movie to that um yeah I had both those they're great I have none of this I have no input no you haven't you you never got to be a master dude I was like what 26 when these games came out no I was listening to some cool techno music at that time listen like a blonde or something no I was never Nirvana listener uh they're on shitter brothers at Chemical Brothers Fatboy Slim I mean I was kind of the mainstream electronica that then my movie oh no Moby no Moby no ha ha ha rhinoceros if you really want to go for a throwback there but yeah now I was in a different place hmm musically yeah at a certain point in my life I had the entire pokerap memorized yeah me too I mean look I I feel like every song on to be a master is pretty good yeah I don't recall it that well but I think if I listen to it now I'd be like oh no these are bad but but like bad in a good way of like I remember singing my heart out to this as a kid yeah like a fun bad not like like rustling smell like wrestling at all what what are you talking about every memory I have a wrestling is pristine and perfect and great I got a a Japanese album in Boston Nick who gets mentioned on the show more than enough I feel like he took us to one of these uh I don't know what to call it like a like a small Hannam a slash toy shop that's nothing but import stuff from Japan and they had a bunch of of Digimon and yugioh and Pokemon and one piece and Avatar just everywhere and they were and Nick actually went in because he was like they close at 9:00 and we didn't get we didn't get to that area until like 855 he went in and he asked if they could stay open a little later so we could look because they had dad some legit Pokemon stuff they even had the little monster hunter like figure statues and they did so they stayed open later and now now because they offered to sale open later because you know we're out of town and and they were about to close I was I felt obligated to buy something for them staying open later so I was looking and looking cuz they had all these great Pokemon things and I was like I want something that's not extremely overpriced but also something that I can't just jump on ebay for and and buy at the same overpriced price and I found a a music CD an album that was Howard how to draw a Pokemon and it was four songs and then a a small coloring book all in like this this audio case would teach you how to draw like a Pikachu and like a Voltorb and like a Jigglypuff like the easiest Pokemon the draw and there's just there maybe five songs but five really very Japanese very kids very poppy songs that I don't understand but I want to do something with it in the future because it was such a such a weird find and I think it's super fascinating and it came out within the first year of Pokemon debuting in Japan so it's very old very cool so I want to do something with that but that's just piggybacking off the whole audio CD slash music thing yeah let's do a couple more emails here this is from Claire hi I'm a new listener of it's super effective and I really like it thank you as a die-hard Pokemon fan I listen to whatever I have at the chance I found it by searching Pokemon on my favorite podcast app and it turned out well aka super effective appeared as the top result best regards Claire Thank You Claire I appreciate that I think Claire may live here in DC yeah there's no there is no location let's do one more here man we have so many emails I feel so bad but I don't want to run I don't want to run terribly over calum writes in from Melbourne Victoria I believe that is the good Australia I believe you are correct I write sentences hey spj and anyone else from the a or b team I've been listening to the show since episode two mythical came out and recommend a friend recommended to me I have I wrote to ask you guys two questions one what is your favorite type of trainer in the Pokemon series I feel like we just answered this and two if you were to get rid of one type of type which would you remove come on purely of that type would change to another type for example Dharma no tan would become fire fighting if it fire was removed kale masa says I like I feel like I read isn't getting enough love from the PKM caste community so hashtag team Irene thanks so much for the work and keep the tomb tube Warner warmers clean and keep the tube warmers clean in 2017 Caleb a hash tag team Irene yeah I mean I read as my friend I mean that's even better than just podcast love I guess so raise your intentions no I'm kidding ah not again uh I would still go with pokey parents for the first question yeah hiker Phil oh I preschooler this time yeah a real cute oh they're pretty great and then you take their money ah question to which type would you remove from the game normal I don't I it's so silly to me that there is a normal type like ah that was my answer to I can see that but I was actually thinking ground okay all right I can see that because you have rock and you have mine yes deal all right that's good choice my to piggyback off Logan to have a type that is normal just seems so weird in the fact that no Pokemon are actually normal yeah nothing yeah normal just looking at the birds like Pidgeot or furo why are they normal flying did you could just keep me flying yeah because then they'd be Opie that's not my problem anymore maybe maybe in generation 1 they would have been just Opie but now that's that's not really an issue right yeah I think it's totally fine to remove normal cuz I mean like Steve saying everything should be able to be in a type I mean normal doesn't make any sense maybe replace that with sound type yeah that's all I'm talking about good yeah yeah it just feels like each Pokemon should have strengths and weaknesses and normal doesn't really benefit from that at all yeah it's so weird like ghosts can't hit right at I don't know it isn't like that makes sense the go is the normal like okay cool I get it yeah but something like delcatty which is just a normal cat Pokemon no no one's ever gonna use delcatty dope Kenny's great super cute would love to use it make it ice or something or Dirk I don't know I mean like you if you made it I see you'd have to pretty significantly change its design but yeah I don't know there's probably an answer in there somewhere but I just don't like the I just don't like that there's a normal type alright I said that was the last one but we'll do one more yeah no I just don't want to fall too behind on these yeah it's doing alder one oh this is the one I was referencing earlier the scheme those are those will stir up a debate joseph Wrightson titled fan games and fossils hey everyone semi longtime listener I never never completed a Pokemon game gasps but I am still a huge fan of the series I have two questions that I hope will spark spark some discussion first first you may have heard of a few months ago about a an unexpected takedown of a fan game six years in the making called pokemon uranium only a few days after Atlanta launched last fall they were contacted by Nintendo lawyers in order to take it down with no warning or consider my entry into the Pokemon universe a browser MMO called Pokemon Omega that was ordered to cease indices after years of building a thriving community shortly before the release of Omega Ruby alpha sapphire for obvious reasons on the other hand I'm sure you've heard of pixelmon minecraft mod which allows you to catch train and battle blocky Pokemon in your Minecraft world this is obviously still up and running after after an equally illusionists history despite not being affiliated with all so question 1 what do you think about the way Nintendo and Game Freak is are handling their intellectual properties regarding fan games and other things like these on the other hand copyright law is very much a thing but on the other hand it's worth much mentioning how much free advertising games can be from from this afterall I was drawn to the series through a fan game and question 2 on a completely different note how do you feel about their no new fossils in Sun and Moon I've always been a fan of fossil Pokemon and I'm a little disappointed that Game Freak missed what could be a neat opportunity in gen 7 considering the island theme sorry for the long email but I thought it would be a good discussion to have from you guys and maybe you could do a fossil Pokemon the week sometime Mastodon thanks for all the great work you do Joe so just from a purely legal perspective and you'll have to forgive me a little bit because it's been at least 15 years since I've looked at the stuff legally um there's a world of and these are distinct legal terms trademark copyright and trade secret that you have to protect in different ways I don't think you can ever lose copyright but trademarks which tend to be characters that are emblematic of the brand that you are selling you have to continually legally protect or you lose them so the classic example of this is people complain when the Disney Company sues daycare centers that have Disney characters painted on their walls but the thing is if Disney did not sue those daycare centers then anybody could put Disney characters anywhere because you know the other people can say well you let these people have it in their area and so if you're letting them do it for free then we can do it for free yeah it's the same with like Nintendo and that Metroid game that they took down yeah fans complain that this Nintendo should have just bought it and they should incorporate it and then turn it into an actual Metroid game like the game was done they could just do that but if they were to agree and they were to do that then they're not actually protecting their IP and therefore in the future like will said with the Disney the next person could come along and make a Metroid game and call it Metroid and Nintendo couldn't do anything to that they couldn't cease-and-desist it they couldn't ask for it take down because they initially didn't protect their copyright the first time and so that's why a lot of the times you see companies that that go like don't don't send us fan stuff like we can't look at it because if we look at it and we we somehow get inspiration from that then you can you can claim that it was yours and blah blah blah and so it's just like this very messy situation so the easiest thing for a company do to is just say hey remove that yeah and also in this Pokemon uranium version from what I can see it's they literally use the Pokemon font and the Pokemon word of uranium version and if all of the gameplay and everything is based on the same mechanics or pay maybe like a reverse engineered version of the games then that's just theft but yeah I mean ah it's it's like a beautiful little love letter but I mean okay Pokemon uranium from what I know about it which is not much but they had one good idea which is that there's a well I I don't know they could have lots of good ideas but one idea that I thought was very interesting was they have an additional type in it which is like radioactive type something huh so no not this time but radioactive which radioactive is like super effective against all types and all types are super effective against it which I thought was a very interesting little mechanic but yeah this is literally just Pokemon you can't just steal you can't just read the title and then release that it's also something where they're you know like free advertising is kind of up in the air because it's not really if you play through this game you like this was this was released around the same time as similar graphical stuff was being put out like black and white to I think is that correct I don't know any I know he came out 2016 last year yeah are you serious okay well they were working on it for a long time then six um yeah but it looks exactly like like a black and white - or something so if somebody play's that they're actually less likely to want to go pick up another Pokemon game unless it like really struck them but for most people it's going to just scratch that itch and they're done and they won't spend any money on I'm talking about stuff in addition to all the stuff that will end Steve listed which is you've got to protect your own copyright or everybody can just have it yeah and that's like the worst thing III think we can all agree that's the worst thing about intellectual property law is it puts the burden on the person who's intellectual property is being abused to defend it or they lose it rather than putting a punishment that on somebody who's clearly infringing intellectual property well they're I mean there's there's tons of bad things about electoral property law but well no I of course and it always favorable it it's never gonna be clear-cut then I I just there is no way intellectual property law is ever going to be clear-cut it will always have to be debated and there will always be hurt feelings I don't you know how the the pixel mod 'minecraft works and why it's why it's still a thing I mean it's probably it's probably extremely different enough - yeah it's like I mean the battle system might mimic Pokemon but it is not literally two creatures facing off against each other with HP bars and stuff I mean yo for making Lois it's crummy minecraft right the quality yeah there's not I mean I recently had this discussion with one of my co-workers because I and I apologized I know many people in our community are huge Minecraft fans I cannot comprehend why anyone would spend more than two minutes playing Minecraft so it's like us except that they're you don't touch I mean I hold what you're saying to me when people say it's just Legos is like that there could be a virtual knitting game where I'm like make virtual blankets and clothes for people through knitting action no you know what I knit because I make something real it's it's more like it's like like Photoshop is what you're looking for there and lots of people love Photoshop like the ganic but then you can print the photos if I was a kid though that my biggest problem as a kid and I'm just trying to play devil's advocate here is that I never had enough Legos and so to have a computer game that could give me unlimited Lego so I could build you know a 2 million piece Pikachu as tall as I want like that's something I could never actually do in real life because my parents were poor and racist as we learned everybody knows races do not get like is I mean maybe I'm just just from two different of perspectives having you know spent my childhood in Hawaii most of the time it was very comfortable and easy to be outdoors and I did outdoors stuff and I wasn't sitting there although I did have Legos but I just wasn't spending all my time playing with piles of Legos you know I'd be out in the pool or walking around the neighborhood doing jump rope with my friends it was also the 70s we didn't have computers Oh as a kid who didn't do a lot of stuff outside and pretty much only played video games I think there's a lot of like you said you can you can print out the thing that you made on Photoshop like you can also not I mean I don't think that anything needs to have a physical component to be worthwhile or fun I mean that's that's a huge division between us right i I if I'm going to spend my time and this is specifically if I'm going to spend my time building something if I'm going to spend my time doing creation I want there to be a physical manifestation of it so you don't want to stay really hard and lost and you took do something build something you would want compensation no I would want to be able much like the Pokemon art that I have hanging on the walls of my house and the Destiny art that I have I want to be able to frame it and hang it on my wall like I do and I can look over and I'm like oh look at that cute but art of a guru an azure remark that somebody made and I have framed hanging right there that I can look at and touch if I want to touch it that's not like you can't be turned off when the computer gets turned off well see it's weird because sure you don't have exactly that but in a way you can share it with many many many other people in the world and they can experience it in a way they wouldn't be able to from just a photograph in Minecraft like if you shares anything I hate it is sharing I got to not like to share let's I just say like clear that so just like yesterday somebody posted a video where somebody someone had made all of Hogwarts in Minecraft and you know like if you want to you can go you can download that world and walk around at Hogwarts and that's a thing that a you couldn't do because it's cost prohibitive how many Lego bricks it would take be there would only be one version of it so nobody apply for a job at Legoland and make a Legoland hogwarts model yeah but ran so the order one others might might file intellectual property rights and then you'd have to take the leg goes down no it's it's like isn't like a land in like Germany they have no intellectual property lawyers now there's a Legoland in California's they're not I don't know never been before now I'm pretty sure there is I think here's a Legoland and it's somewhere the United States the second question here is how do you feel about no fossils being in Sun Moon there are fossils in sun and moon letting go to the guy you gotta the jurassic park trailer guy yeah it was oh wow that's fine yeah can I'm not I'm not in love with with fossils or the brush yeah you know they couldn't fit him they couldn't fit him and I wouldn't want something forced into the game of like oh we need to have fossil cuz every other game has had fossils I take when I go deep floor for you guys oh go for it right no fossils in Hawaii there are no fossils in Hawaii because they're volcanic islands and they are relatively new land quote quote geologically speaking so that there would not be sedimentary fossils found in the sediment of the islands boom will with the science on you ending on that volcano note ah let me run down Pokemon the week real quick again no Travis Logan's a little bit competitive so if you want to chime in you're more than welcome to this is it one of those six pok√©mon that are on my team right now no it's not it's not agate link we might have done this one before but I picked gastro down this week Gaston is is in the top something of competitive good old my confidence right there the top something I know gas drums still being used it was used in the past competitively so I figured it would be a okay choice for those interested in using gastro down the move said I have here from our slack community shout out to Kevin for providing this Kevin always on top of the moves or the the move the the loadouts don't know if they're 100 percent accurate or not but I trust his judgment we have a sassy nature 252 and HP 104 in defense 152 in special defense C when you split it like that I feel like they know what they're talking about I insurance it's built a survive a specific attack from a specific one yeah they cal count the amount of damage that it's like biggest threat is going to do and then that's why you can that's why you can trust these move sets uh idle moves leftovers ability as storm drain with the moves scold toxic and Rick and then for your fourth move you have you have a couple options you can either go with secret power you can go with ice beam you can go with sludge bomb or you can go with earth power so whichever whichever ones fits your loadout a little bit of customization there but the first three are scold toxic and recover and again this this will be able to be used in double battles Kevin's right up is gastro down is a special tank the first three moves served cause status and keep living the last move can be brought in for coverage for can be brought in for coverage or you could just default to protect storm drains heals you if you are hit by a water types so he is also great if you have a fire type Pokemon like our k9 and you think you're going to get slammed by a water type move the storm drain sucks in all the water abilities so it keeps Pokemon like our k9 safe yeah so I think if somebody tries to attack you with water then the water actually diverts and goes over to gastro Don and then gastrin on heals get forces all single target water moves to strike the book Mountains ability and rather than doing damage it heals them and if you get a shiny gastro Don it is a puke green who are both of them because there's two different colors of gastro Don yeah there's a pink and a blue yeah depending on which side of the island you get it from there's a pink and a blue both their tops so like the pink one has a brown top and the blue the blue one has a green top both their tops turn into like this puke brown greenish color yeah it's really not for him it's really really not I mean they're slugs so I guess it kind of works like but I mean the pink one just gets strictly worse as yeah that's true that's true why I would say they both get worst look cuz they're both the blue and the pink are really vibrant and then they just get so muted it looks like it looks like they were plushies that you sat in the Sun for a very long time at some trivia here all according to an interview it with Nintendo Power Ken Sugimori shallows and gastro Don were originally intended for pokemon ruby and sapphire but were not implemented due to time constraints both the shallows and gastro Don have early sprites within the game data of diamond and pearl however there are no front sprites these forms in pokemon diamond and pearl no in-game trainer uses East Sea gastro Don in battle even on the side of Mount Cornett and pokemon platinum all trainers east side of Mount Cornett have East Sea gastro Don prior two generations six gastro Don's body style was this aunt looking thing I don't know that means it's probably to see it use good ol Bobby pedia but there yeah that's it let some gastro done love if you're going into some competitive's might be a good choice so to speak more on that okay so first of all I'm you guys always talk about calyx I don't know if everybody listening actually understands what that actually it's from or means can I go into that for a little bit sure so if you you can just search Pokemon calculator on Google but it's Pokemon showdown comm slash damage calc and it has basically the a bunch of selectors where you can select your Pokemon or the Pokemon that you're going to Train and then the Pokemon you want to survive their attack from so anybody who's currently top of the meta like so maybe you want to survive type of cuckoos thunder this isn't a good example for gastro Don um what about taboo bulu you want to survive an attack from taboo bulu because you get rain or something right like because you're you're four times weak to that as gastro Don and but maybe there's a build because he's pretty tanky maybe there's a build where you still end up with 1 hp this is all based on math and the Pokemon can do a little bit more a little bit less whenever it hits with an attack but you can make your V's that you give to your Pokemon such that it has just like 1 hp more than the maximum amount that taboo bula can do and the way to plan that out is to go to this damage calculator and put the foot both hook'em on in against each other and then it shows like all their moves and what they would do to the other one it's it's a super handy tool and when people make very specific builds like those DUHS that Eevee spread that that Steve listed for this one that's where they get these from it's it's a very specific amount of EVs that are trying to make your Pokemon survive versus whatever specific hit yes and if you are confused earlier about the trivia East Sea gastro downs are blue and green West sea gastro downs are pink and brown yeah there's I don't think there's any difference in the rain just knitting ah just yeah how they look and I didn't even realize it but body style is actually a thing you can search on in your pokedex when you're searching for Pokemon oh cool Wow I didn't say this earlier but again if you have any emails Pokemon or not Pokemon related send those over to SBJ at pkmn
