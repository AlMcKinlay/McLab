the opposite of a bonus what's the hell (0:40 - 0:46)
of a bonus a penalty penalty episode why (0:42 - 0:47)

trust your weight from our wonderful (0:47 - 0:50)
mouths (0:49 - 0:53)
greg also here i am also here (0:50 - 0:56)
happy to be here (0:53 - 0:59)
full of conspiracies theories about this (0:56 - 1:01)
game believe me i got a lot (0:59 - 1:04)
okay so we're gonna this is uh this is (1:01 - 1:06)
part three of impressions if you haven't (1:04 - 1:09)
listened to part one of impressions that (1:06 - 1:10)
was uh (1:09 - 1:12)
episode 498 (1:10 - 1:15)
and then 4.99 was normal and then last (1:12 - 1:17)
thursday there was episode two of (1:15 - 1:18)
impressions (1:17 - 1:20)
um (1:18 - 1:22)
we are only going to talk up to credit (1:20 - 1:24)
roll i know there is a post game to this (1:22 - 1:28)
i know that technically the real ending (1:24 - 1:30)
which i i i dislike when games do that (1:28 - 1:34)
the real ending is in post game because (1:30 - 1:37)
we we know factually just by looking at (1:34 - 1:39)
like playstation trophies (1:37 - 1:42)
not a lot of people beat games (1:39 - 1:44)
and when people beat games they when (1:42 - 1:46)
they get credits they move on to the (1:44 - 1:48)
next game uh so (1:46 - 1:50)
like hiding the real ending behind (1:48 - 1:52)
credits is always (1:50 - 1:55)
in not to me not the best (1:52 - 1:56)
tactic uh (1:55 - 1:57)
okay (1:56 - 2:00)
i i'm gonna get into it because we're (1:57 - 2:01)
gonna have to define terms because i'm (2:00 - 2:04)
already getting frustrated what which (2:01 - 2:05)
part of frustrating like frustrated at (2:04 - 2:10)
steve or frustrated at this point (2:05 - 2:10)
i'm frustrated at everybody so we've got (2:10 - 2:14)
the full range okay (2:12 - 2:16)
let's (2:14 - 2:18)
let's talk about the story (2:16 - 2:20)
i wanna so this is where we're gonna (2:18 - 2:22)
first get into our frustration point (2:20 - 2:25)
yes i i'm going to before before i even (2:22 - 2:28)
dive into my thoughts on the story i (2:25 - 2:30)
want to say that i love this game (2:28 - 2:33)
i still think it's worth the 60 (2:30 - 2:35)
i also want to i also want to say that i (2:33 - 2:38)
think out of all the pokemon games x and (2:35 - 2:40)
y has one of the worst stories (2:38 - 2:42)
but i will say that x and y is one of my (2:40 - 2:45)
favorite pokemon games hands down love x (2:42 - 2:48)
and y okay this is this is going to be (2:45 - 2:49)
okay i need to set ground rules right (2:48 - 2:51)
now because this makes me (2:49 - 2:54)
bonkers every time (2:51 - 2:54)
so we need to define what we mean by (2:55 - 2:58)
story (2:57 - 3:01)
because for most people story means (2:58 - 3:02)
everything that's presented in the game (3:01 - 3:04)
for example if i'm reading lord of the (3:02 - 3:07)
rings i don't discount two-thirds of (3:04 - 3:08)
lord of the rings as not being part of (3:07 - 3:10)
the story because it's not directly (3:08 - 3:13)
involved with the a plotline of a hobbit (3:10 - 3:15)
walking to a volcano to get his finger (3:13 - 3:16)
bit off (3:15 - 3:18)
so when we talk about x and y or this (3:16 - 3:20)
game having a bad story i think we need (3:18 - 3:23)
to be specific that the plot line the (3:20 - 3:26)
main a plot line the thing that you have (3:23 - 3:28)
to do (3:26 - 3:31)
is weak but the story which is (3:28 - 3:34)
everything they present in this game (3:31 - 3:36)
is actually quite amazing (3:34 - 3:37)
so (3:36 - 3:40)
i can see complaints about the main plot (3:37 - 3:43)
line plot line a is very tropey although (3:40 - 3:45)
it touches on some very incredible (3:43 - 3:48)
topics and i (3:45 - 3:50)
disagree that the real ending which i (3:48 - 3:52)
haven't gotten to is post game (3:50 - 3:54)
because the plot line and the themes (3:52 - 3:57)
that they want to explore (3:54 - 4:01)
do finish at credits i agree and then my (3:57 - 4:04)
my complaint is the plot i do think the (4:01 - 4:06)
lore and the world and even the the (4:04 - 4:09)
characteristics of like i i think the (4:06 - 4:11)
warmth thing was fantastic i loved every (4:09 - 4:14)
single interaction (4:11 - 4:14)
when we say things about story i think (4:15 - 4:21)
people think that every it sounds like (4:18 - 4:22)
everything that the game presents is bad (4:21 - 4:25)
and i think we need to be specific that (4:22 - 4:28)
the main plot line is a is a very tropey (4:25 - 4:30)
thing although (4:28 - 4:32)
i have to commend them (4:30 - 4:33)
for (4:32 - 4:35)
attempting to tackle a very (4:33 - 4:38)
big two really big themes and two big (4:35 - 4:39)
subjects (4:38 - 4:40)
um (4:39 - 4:43)
and they do i think rely way too heavily (4:40 - 4:45)
on tropes (4:43 - 4:48)
to tell that story but it also gives (4:45 - 4:50)
them (4:48 - 4:50)
again (4:50 - 4:53)
my complaint one of my complaints about (4:51 - 4:55)
this game is they were very timid in a (4:53 - 4:57)
lot of things that they did and one of (4:55 - 4:59)
the another aspect of where they were (4:57 - 5:02)
timid is how much they rely on standard (4:59 - 5:04)
tropes to do short cuts (5:02 - 5:07)
in the storytelling of the main plotline (5:04 - 5:10)
i would say that they (5:07 - 5:13)
they lent very hard into keeping in all (5:10 - 5:15)
ages accessible (5:13 - 5:16)
storyline (5:15 - 5:19)
when they probably didn't have to (5:16 - 5:21)
i would agree with that i feel like i (5:19 - 5:23)
can sum up my feelings of the plot (5:21 - 5:25)
pretty well i loved the intro i loved (5:23 - 5:27)
like falling through a wormhole from uh (5:25 - 5:29)
you're obviously from the future you're (5:27 - 5:33)
following through your phone gets uh (5:29 - 5:35)
step back there one no no no no no no no (5:33 - 5:37)
no (5:35 - 5:40)
not not future no you're from someplace (5:37 - 5:41)
else (5:40 - 5:44)
it is it is very clear (5:41 - 5:46)
when you get to the fourth area that (5:44 - 5:48)
this is an alternate dimension or an (5:46 - 5:52)
alternate universe yes the ingo (5:48 - 5:53)
100 (5:52 - 5:55)
tells you this isn't back in time this (5:53 - 5:58)
is an alternate dimension at (5:55 - 5:59)
minimum (5:58 - 6:02)
and then all new universe (5:59 - 6:03)
possibly (6:02 - 6:06)
and this is this has been proven by the (6:03 - 6:08)
other games they follow exactly what the (6:06 - 6:10)
other games have been so there isn't (6:08 - 6:11)
time travel (6:10 - 6:14)
and it's not connected to the main (6:11 - 6:17)
universe which is why i no longer can (6:14 - 6:20)
say that oh this is so-and-so's ancestor (6:17 - 6:22)
because (6:20 - 6:25)
how this universe got created (6:22 - 6:28)
everybody is based off of a reflection (6:25 - 6:29)
of (6:28 - 6:31)
people from the world that you came from (6:29 - 6:34)
and since pokemon already established a (6:31 - 6:36)
multi-universe (6:34 - 6:39)
system yeah they must set up with auras (6:36 - 6:42)
alpha sapphire and establish what (6:39 - 6:43)
happens (6:42 - 6:46)
when you accidentally get pulled into an (6:43 - 6:48)
alternate universe through annabelle (6:46 - 6:50)
annabelle who is also a frontier brain (6:48 - 6:53)
suffers the same fate that ingo does by (6:50 - 6:54)
being accidentally sucked into a (6:53 - 6:56)
universe that isn't theirs (6:54 - 6:58)
yeah but when the game opens you don't (6:56 - 7:01)
know that you're correct you are from (6:58 - 7:02)
the future because you're either wearing (7:01 - 7:04)
the alola shirt or the x and y shirt (7:02 - 7:06)
right and (7:04 - 7:08)
the other thing i wanted to add was that (7:06 - 7:10)
uh kajita is that kajita is how you (7:08 - 7:11)
would pronounce it (7:10 - 7:14)
very clearly says you are from a place (7:11 - 7:17)
that is far farther yeah i'm pretty sure (7:14 - 7:19)
it was cochito who said that (7:17 - 7:20)
and they bring up multiple dimensions (7:19 - 7:23)
multiple times yes but (7:20 - 7:25)
the inclusion of ingo (7:23 - 7:27)
is the big twist and why i really love (7:25 - 7:30)
the fourth area because it's at that (7:27 - 7:32)
point you realize you're not in the past (7:30 - 7:33)
that you are somewhere (7:32 - 7:36)
absolutely completely different (7:33 - 7:37)
and (7:36 - 7:40)
there is a bigger story of how this (7:37 - 7:42)
place got created which i will bit i (7:40 - 7:44)
still haven't spoiled myself on so i do (7:42 - 7:47)
not know who's behind it i have (7:44 - 7:48)
theories and if you want to hear (7:47 - 7:50)
theories you all can reach out to me (7:48 - 7:52)
because i got theories about all this (7:50 - 7:55)
but it is very clear when you hit fourth (7:52 - 7:57)
area that (7:55 - 8:00)
okay we are (7:57 - 8:00)
historian region did not exist in the (8:01 - 8:04)
world that we know it this was (8:02 - 8:07)
specifically created (8:04 - 8:10)
i think in the the and this is what i i (8:07 - 8:12)
tweeted i think the first three areas (8:10 - 8:13)
are (8:12 - 8:15)
fine they're very like to the book (8:13 - 8:19)
pokemon game nothing too fancy meet (8:15 - 8:21)
professor meet characters here's the (8:19 - 8:24)
drama you know let's get lunch (8:21 - 8:26)
and then the fourth area areas where i (8:24 - 8:28)
was like (8:26 - 8:30)
i want to pay attention now because ingo (8:28 - 8:31)
is here and i love (8:30 - 8:34)
i love that they have put ingo maybe (8:31 - 8:36)
emmett emmett doesn't show up but (8:34 - 8:38)
i'm curious (8:36 - 8:39)
to (8:38 - 8:41)
somebody who has never played gen five (8:39 - 8:44)
and even if you play gen five it is very (8:41 - 8:46)
easy to miss in go and oh yeah you have (8:44 - 8:48)
to oh yeah yeah out of your way to find (8:46 - 8:50)
out how much (8:48 - 8:51)
um (8:50 - 8:53)
i wonder if that whole area fell flat (8:51 - 8:54)
for those people (8:53 - 8:56)
because like (8:54 - 8:58)
they would be like who is this this is (8:56 - 8:59)
just a new character is this a new (8:58 - 9:01)
character who is this guy is he always (8:59 - 9:04)
talking about trains i i so i think it (9:01 - 9:07)
it rides a very good line because if you (9:04 - 9:08)
don't know who that character is you (9:07 - 9:09)
know (9:08 - 9:12)
that it's another person who (9:09 - 9:14)
who is suffering a different fate from (9:12 - 9:15)
you (9:14 - 9:18)
and i think for those of us who are very (9:15 - 9:20)
steeped in lower it has a much bigger (9:18 - 9:24)
impact but what that area does even (9:20 - 9:25)
even if you don't know anything about (9:24 - 9:29)
the games when ingo appears you realize (9:25 - 9:31)
that some it is the signifier that (9:29 - 9:33)
something bigger has gone wrong (9:31 - 9:34)
well something has happened i'm not (9:33 - 9:37)
gonna say right or wrong yeah something (9:34 - 9:39)
has definitely happened (9:37 - 9:40)
um (9:39 - 9:43)
and i i i think the impact is (9:40 - 9:46)
stronger for fans but i don't think it's (9:43 - 9:48)
necessarily lessened for people because (9:46 - 9:51)
it is a no matter how you look at it is (9:48 - 9:53)
the twist the first three areas set you (9:51 - 9:55)
up for a pattern where you think i know (9:53 - 9:58)
what this game is i know where i am (9:55 - 10:01)
and no matter what fourth area says and (9:58 - 10:02)
turn (10:01 - 10:03)
it's not (10:02 - 10:04)
for me it's very (10:03 - 10:07)
much uh along the lines of this people (10:04 - 10:08)
are either going to get this or they're (10:07 - 10:10)
not going to get this it's very much (10:08 - 10:12)
like nabakov's book lolita (10:10 - 10:14)
if you read lolita it's a story it's a (10:12 - 10:18)
pretty disturbing story (10:14 - 10:19)
but it's a straight and you if you don't (10:18 - 10:21)
know anything (10:19 - 10:23)
you you read a story (10:21 - 10:24)
but (10:23 - 10:26)
if you're somebody who knows literature (10:24 - 10:29)
you understand that pretty much every (10:26 - 10:31)
page of that book is a reference to (10:29 - 10:33)
other pieces of literature throughout (10:31 - 10:35)
history (10:33 - 10:37)
right so you can play this game and you (10:35 - 10:38)
know you see all the characters and (10:37 - 10:40)
you're like great character designs (10:38 - 10:42)
interesting people lots of stuff (10:40 - 10:44)
without knowing that all of these people (10:42 - 10:47)
are references to other pokemon games (10:44 - 10:48)
yeah and i don't know that that's a bad (10:47 - 10:50)
thing right like no it's not that it's (10:48 - 10:53)
just it's a different experience yeah (10:50 - 10:54)
if you want to become a scholar you say (10:53 - 10:56)
then you start researching okay who are (10:54 - 10:58)
these people where are they from why (10:56 - 11:02)
were they inserted in these places (10:58 - 11:02)
no i don't think the character designs (11:03 - 11:06)
are strong on their own and are (11:04 - 11:08)
benefited if you know the series (11:06 - 11:10)
i definitely get like um a different (11:08 - 11:12)
point of view than a person sitting in (11:10 - 11:15)
their living room on their couch playing (11:12 - 11:17)
you know through legends because you (11:15 - 11:19)
know when when i saw ingo you know (11:17 - 11:21)
people saw my reactions of like oh my (11:19 - 11:23)
gosh ingo is in this game and it's ingo (11:21 - 11:25)
it's not like (11:23 - 11:27)
uh lingo or like some ancestors or (11:25 - 11:30)
something and and it was (11:27 - 11:32)
not shocking to me but kind of shocking (11:30 - 11:35)
that over like half my chat you know i (11:32 - 11:37)
had 500 people watching they were like (11:35 - 11:39)
who is this (11:37 - 11:41)
and it's like let me explain who this is (11:39 - 11:42)
and why this is kind of crazy because (11:41 - 11:44)
this this this (11:42 - 11:46)
and i get it right like again for these (11:44 - 11:48)
are two characters in go and emmet that (11:46 - 11:51)
you have to actually find in black and (11:48 - 11:53)
white it's not like (11:51 - 11:56)
wolfrick or or marlin like they're not (11:53 - 11:58)
presented in front of you when you play (11:56 - 12:00)
through the game in black 2 white 2 you (11:58 - 12:01)
are presented with ingo and emmett but (12:00 - 12:05)
we also know that black 2 white 2 is (12:01 - 12:07)
not the most popular play only (12:05 - 12:08)
it didn't sell that many copies compared (12:07 - 12:10)
to the other pokemon games like (12:08 - 12:13)
but it's the sa it's the same thing that (12:10 - 12:15)
annabelle was in omega ruby after (12:13 - 12:17)
sapphire yeah if you didn't play emerald (12:15 - 12:20)
and you didn't do the battlefront tier (12:17 - 12:22)
you had no clue what the connection was (12:20 - 12:25)
with annabelle either um (12:22 - 12:28)
and you knew it was somebody who came (12:25 - 12:29)
from somewhere else who lost their (12:28 - 12:30)
memory (12:29 - 12:33)
and again (12:30 - 12:35)
if you know more there's more there and (12:33 - 12:37)
i do think (12:35 - 12:40)
it does it is a way for people to entice (12:37 - 12:41)
people who are like why are all these (12:40 - 12:43)
people having this reaction to this (12:41 - 12:45)
character i don't know what's going on (12:43 - 12:48)
now i want to know it is a teaser and i (12:45 - 12:49)
like that (12:48 - 12:51)
yeah i i think the i think the fourth (12:49 - 12:53)
area (12:51 - 12:55)
plot wise (12:53 - 12:57)
is is really strong (12:55 - 12:59)
and if you if you get to the fourth area (12:57 - 13:01)
and you still don't care i don't think i (12:59 - 13:02)
don't think the ending's gonna convince (13:01 - 13:05)
you at that point it introduces (13:02 - 13:07)
my least favorite character of the silly (13:05 - 13:08)
series (13:07 - 13:10)
yeah and then um (13:08 - 13:12)
there's not like (13:10 - 13:14)
i think the problem i also have with the (13:12 - 13:15)
plot (13:14 - 13:17)
and this leads into maybe the ending and (13:15 - 13:18)
i'm sorry we're maybe jumping around or (13:17 - 13:20)
going too fast is there there's not (13:18 - 13:22)
really anyone to hate (13:20 - 13:24)
throughout this whole game (13:22 - 13:26)
and then they they're like (13:24 - 13:29)
here's mellie (13:26 - 13:29)
but like (13:29 - 13:33)
but nelly's not a villain they're just (13:31 - 13:35)
he's not there's but yeah there is (13:33 - 13:37)
really no like no (13:35 - 13:40)
villain per se either there are people (13:37 - 13:42)
in the town that you're like oh are you (13:40 - 13:44)
going to turn on me (13:42 - 13:45)
well (13:44 - 13:48)
i mean the potato guy has a villain turn (13:45 - 13:50)
for a minute and so does for a minute (13:48 - 13:53)
the commander yeah and that's the part i (13:50 - 13:56)
hate it so here's the thing (13:53 - 13:59)
i actually really liked (13:56 - 13:59)
wally (13:59 - 14:03)
wally i actually really like that and (14:00 - 14:04)
that that section leading up to that and (14:03 - 14:07)
what the ending was because (14:04 - 14:09)
you sort of got the first theme of hey (14:07 - 14:11)
maybe religious extremism is bad by the (14:09 - 14:14)
end of the fourth (14:11 - 14:16)
thing when the fifth started and ended (14:14 - 14:18)
and then (14:16 - 14:21)
the world is gripped by fear (14:18 - 14:24)
it underlined what the other theme of (14:21 - 14:25)
what a lot of people were going through (14:24 - 14:27)
is that hey maybe making fear-based (14:25 - 14:31)
decisions is a really bad idea and maybe (14:27 - 14:34)
doing things based solely out of fear is (14:31 - 14:39)
also a really bad idea and that entire (14:34 - 14:42)
after you complete because the idea is (14:39 - 14:44)
the fifth area right yes (14:42 - 14:46)
after you complete the fifth area and (14:44 - 14:48)
you sort of understand that (14:46 - 14:50)
they are they are coming to terms the (14:48 - 14:53)
fact that maybe maybe having such an (14:50 - 14:55)
extreme divide amongst their clients has (14:53 - 14:57)
never been good for this region (14:55 - 14:59)
an event happens to (14:57 - 15:02)
implant then the theme of (14:59 - 15:04)
you've all just been reacting on fear (15:02 - 15:06)
and it's something that they really (15:04 - 15:08)
underline with the starly (15:06 - 15:10)
uh side mission of a person who really (15:08 - 15:12)
wants to be with starling but is (15:10 - 15:14)
terrified of it and (15:12 - 15:15)
there's a (15:14 - 15:18)
huge theme at that point of (15:15 - 15:21)
don't allow fear to hold you back it is (15:18 - 15:23)
scary but there are benefits if you push (15:21 - 15:27)
past that and it's really important (15:23 - 15:30)
that i think benny and kamada happen (15:27 - 15:32)
i do think it's a disservice that they (15:30 - 15:35)
took a very tropey way of doing it (15:32 - 15:37)
yeah when i was talking to greg before (15:35 - 15:40)
the show i was like when when ninja guy (15:37 - 15:41)
shows up (15:40 - 15:44)
and he transforms into wally (15:41 - 15:46)
i love wally so much and i was so happy (15:44 - 15:48)
i was like this is a cool twist not as (15:46 - 15:50)
cool as ingo but like okay potato guy is (15:48 - 15:52)
here and he's (15:50 - 15:54)
and he he does the same exact thing that (15:52 - 15:57)
oleana does which is (15:54 - 15:59)
uh our leader (15:57 - 16:01)
is doing something that you're not going (15:59 - 16:03)
to agree with and i'm here to stop you (16:01 - 16:05)
and you defeat him (16:03 - 16:07)
and (16:05 - 16:11)
he goes the same thing as olianna goes (16:07 - 16:12)
you must now stop (16:11 - 16:15)
well i mean what what is interesting (16:12 - 16:16)
about those characters and what happens (16:15 - 16:19)
with that trope is you and they are the (16:16 - 16:21)
person that loves (16:19 - 16:24)
their friend unconditionally but doesn't (16:21 - 16:26)
believe in the cause (16:24 - 16:29)
neither aliana or benny believe in what (16:26 - 16:32)
they're doing they are they are (16:29 - 16:33)
100 (16:32 - 16:36)
they're that person's their best friend (16:33 - 16:38)
yes and so when you show them (16:36 - 16:40)
[Music] (16:38 - 16:41)
that (16:40 - 16:43)
well when you show them like hey i can (16:41 - 16:44)
defeat you (16:43 - 16:47)
and i actually pose a threat (16:44 - 16:49)
they immediately drop the cost because (16:47 - 16:52)
their only concern ever has been their (16:49 - 16:54)
friend and both of them are like please (16:52 - 16:57)
go save this person because i understand (16:54 - 16:59)
that they're lost you understand that (16:57 - 17:02)
they're lost but i as this (16:59 - 17:04)
super supportive friend could never do (17:02 - 17:06)
anything about it and that is a quick (17:04 - 17:09)
trope lesson of like (17:06 - 17:11)
not calling out your friends and like (17:09 - 17:13)
only being super supportive and you know (17:11 - 17:15)
not not dealing with troubling behavior (17:13 - 17:16)
it is (17:15 - 17:19)
a shortcut that i think has become so (17:16 - 17:21)
tropey that we've really (17:19 - 17:24)
we tend to gloss over what that actually (17:21 - 17:26)
does for a game (17:24 - 17:28)
and i do wish they'd spend more time on (17:26 - 17:32)
it i wish they would really underline it (17:28 - 17:35)
and again they just they quit tropic (17:32 - 17:36)
with so that you get the gist of what's (17:35 - 17:38)
happening (17:36 - 17:39)
and it does (17:38 - 17:42)
undercut some of what's happening (17:39 - 17:44)
i also (17:42 - 17:44)
i just don't like how cool uh i just (17:45 - 17:49)
don't like how the commander turns i (17:47 - 17:51)
just don't think he there's like enough (17:49 - 17:54)
there to justify him they they gave you (17:51 - 17:56)
one sentence (17:54 - 17:58)
that he he and benny's town wherever (17:56 - 18:00)
they came from had been destroyed by (17:58 - 18:03)
pokemon that had gone on a rampage and (18:00 - 18:06)
that's why he was afraid of pokemon out (18:03 - 18:08)
of control they do three things (18:06 - 18:10)
at the beginning he talks about that (18:08 - 18:12)
they don't trust you (18:10 - 18:13)
and there's a second thing where (18:12 - 18:16)
refugees show up on jesui region they (18:13 - 18:17)
are they are said that they are (18:16 - 18:19)
travelers they're hinted that they're (18:17 - 18:21)
refugees and then the third is can you (18:19 - 18:23)
talk about the ginkgo people (18:21 - 18:25)
uh no there's a scene where you go to (18:23 - 18:26)
the beach and there's a bunch of people (18:25 - 18:29)
who have a bunch of people (18:26 - 18:29)
there are three things that happen that (18:30 - 18:35)
suggest that kamada has a fear-based (18:32 - 18:38)
belief system the biggest is that their (18:35 - 18:40)
town had been destroyed by rampaging (18:38 - 18:42)
pokemon and they were here to stop it (18:40 - 18:44)
fundamentally like the unspoken thing (18:42 - 18:47)
right the the big paradox that (18:44 - 18:49)
has to be resolved even if it's not (18:47 - 18:51)
clearly resolved is (18:49 - 18:54)
these people do say that they come from (18:51 - 18:57)
places where people are comfortable with (18:54 - 18:59)
pokemon so these are people who are (18:57 - 19:01)
inherently have chosen to come here (18:59 - 19:03)
because they're not comfortable with (19:01 - 19:05)
pokemon (19:03 - 19:07)
right they're like literally like where (19:05 - 19:08)
i come from people (19:07 - 19:11)
battle with pokemon yeah there's (19:08 - 19:12)
actually a mix there's some people who (19:11 - 19:14)
are like (19:12 - 19:16)
i've come here to because (19:14 - 19:18)
i want a more peaceful existence with (19:16 - 19:20)
pokemon so it suggests that in other (19:18 - 19:24)
areas people work with pokemon as (19:20 - 19:26)
weapons which we've seen in the movies (19:24 - 19:28)
it's kind of a hint to the lucario movie (19:26 - 19:30)
where they're in the past and they have (19:28 - 19:34)
armies of pokemon it's also a hint to (19:30 - 19:36)
i mean (19:34 - 19:36)
in in yeah callous reason of of a war (19:36 - 19:42)
there so those are those are ties of we (19:40 - 19:44)
are coming here to be peaceful (19:42 - 19:47)
uh but the person who's in charge (19:44 - 19:50)
has basically (19:47 - 19:54)
ptsd light they hint at it (19:50 - 19:56)
and is making decisions based off of (19:54 - 19:58)
that and (19:56 - 20:00)
again because they went so trophy and (19:58 - 20:02)
they didn't do a deep dive it's really (20:00 - 20:05)
easy to miss those moments (20:02 - 20:07)
and write them off because they don't do (20:05 - 20:09)
a good job in the a plotline of of (20:07 - 20:11)
really (20:09 - 20:14)
doubling down on those things but i i i (20:11 - 20:16)
can think of those three strong (20:14 - 20:17)
instances where they suggest that this (20:16 - 20:22)
is who he is and also uh his (20:17 - 20:23)
main like ever anytime he confronts (20:22 - 20:25)
something unknown what's the first thing (20:23 - 20:27)
he does sumo toss (20:25 - 20:29)
yeah right he's he just reacts with (20:27 - 20:30)
violence (20:29 - 20:31)
yeah that's yeah (20:30 - 20:35)
his first instinct (20:31 - 20:35)
yeah i just i i didn't love like plot (20:36 - 20:40)
aside (20:39 - 20:41)
and this was the other thing that was (20:40 - 20:43)
maybe hard to communicate (20:41 - 20:46)
i just think the like the emotion (20:43 - 20:48)
that the game wanted to give me of that (20:46 - 20:52)
final battle just fell so flat (20:48 - 20:56)
and i think of like (20:52 - 20:58)
i think of it like as a kid playing red (20:56 - 20:59)
and blue (20:58 - 21:00)
and like going through the elite four (20:59 - 21:02)
and losing over and over and over again (21:00 - 21:05)
because my blastoise had surf hydro pump (21:02 - 21:07)
bubble beam and like whatever other (21:05 - 21:08)
water type move because that's how i (21:07 - 21:09)
thought you were supposed to play as a (21:08 - 21:12)
kid and then like (21:09 - 21:14)
beating lance and being like i'm the (21:12 - 21:16)
champion and then getting through that (21:14 - 21:18)
door and being like oh i have another (21:16 - 21:21)
battle and it's my rival and now i just (21:18 - 21:23)
lost my rival because i could barely (21:21 - 21:26)
beat lance and as a kid you know that (21:23 - 21:29)
took me 20 30 40 tries to do because i (21:26 - 21:31)
was 10 and i didn't have the internet (21:29 - 21:32)
and i didn't have a strategy guide and i (21:31 - 21:34)
was just brute forcing it (21:32 - 21:37)
and that felt like a huge accomplishment (21:34 - 21:39)
like i finally beat my rival this dude (21:37 - 21:41)
that was saying like smell you later (21:39 - 21:43)
for 40 hours (21:41 - 21:45)
um (21:43 - 21:47)
and then i think of like a game like (21:45 - 21:49)
black and white which is like the first (21:47 - 21:50)
game where i'm like (21:49 - 21:52)
somewhat of an adult (21:50 - 21:53)
right (21:52 - 21:55)
and when all the gym leaders come at the (21:53 - 21:56)
end (21:55 - 21:58)
you know even though that's not that (21:56 - 21:59)
even though that's not just simply beat (21:58 - 22:01)
the elite four when all the gym leaders (21:59 - 22:03)
show up at the end that's like a really (22:01 - 22:06)
powerful moment in that game i think (22:03 - 22:08)
i i i really enjoyed when they show up (22:06 - 22:10)
all in the end and they're like trying (22:08 - 22:12)
to like the high drama where they're (22:10 - 22:14)
after the sages (22:12 - 22:16)
and then even even though the the (22:14 - 22:20)
the plot line is is is pretty garbage in (22:16 - 22:22)
uh sword and shield with the chairman (22:20 - 22:24)
rose stuff i still think well it makes (22:22 - 22:25)
no sense (22:24 - 22:28)
i still i still think the ending of (22:25 - 22:30)
the game sets up that you're gonna beat (22:28 - 22:34)
this guy that no one else has beaten (22:30 - 22:35)
and then you go through that whole (22:34 - 22:37)
champion circuit and then you battle (22:35 - 22:40)
leon i think still feels great and i (22:37 - 22:41)
even if you're good at pokemon i think (22:40 - 22:44)
leon elise provides somewhat of a like (22:41 - 22:46)
oh he knows what he's doing like he (22:44 - 22:48)
opens really strong with aegislash and (22:46 - 22:51)
um (22:48 - 22:52)
and it's pretty all right at the end of (22:51 - 22:54)
this game (22:52 - 22:57)
you catch either dialgo or palkia (22:54 - 22:59)
you go back (22:57 - 23:01)
to town (22:59 - 23:04)
there's some dialogue and there they and (23:01 - 23:06)
a lot of the dialogue is just like (23:04 - 23:08)
people repeating yourself in the (23:06 - 23:09)
building then you get out of the (23:08 - 23:10)
building and you gotta repeat yourself (23:09 - 23:11)
again (23:10 - 23:12)
and then you get up to the mountain you (23:11 - 23:14)
gotta repeat yourself again and then (23:12 - 23:16)
you're like okay here's here's whatever (23:14 - 23:17)
you two you know i chose palkia the (23:16 - 23:20)
first time so that means diago showed up (23:17 - 23:22)
and then it was just a two minute ramen (23:20 - 23:23)
battle (23:22 - 23:24)
and then it was done we had a very (23:23 - 23:27)
different experience we did we did and a (23:24 - 23:29)
very different experience i i thought (23:27 - 23:31)
that the game was going to like this is (23:29 - 23:34)
the opportunity where with palkia you do (23:31 - 23:35)
bat like when i you have to battle (23:34 - 23:37)
palkia like it is a normal legendary (23:35 - 23:39)
thing so i thought with dialga i was (23:37 - 23:41)
like okay we're gonna we're gonna throw (23:39 - 23:43)
some ramen we're gonna have this battle (23:41 - 23:46)
it's gonna i i felt (23:43 - 23:47)
and this was the thing that ultrasound (23:46 - 23:48)
ultra moon did (23:47 - 23:51)
i thought we were to battle an alternate (23:48 - 23:53)
necrozma again (23:51 - 23:55)
and i think the ending to ultra sun on (23:53 - 23:56)
moon isn't anything special that's why i (23:55 - 23:58)
didn't bring it up compared to sword and (23:56 - 23:59)
shield black and white and pokemon red (23:58 - 24:02)
and blue but i do think that if anyone (23:59 - 24:04)
remembers a high moment in ultrasound (24:02 - 24:06)
ultramoon it is when you battle ultra (24:04 - 24:08)
necros necrozma and the same person who (24:06 - 24:10)
made ultra necrosma (24:08 - 24:12)
and ultimately ultrasound ultramoon was (24:10 - 24:14)
in charge of this game (24:12 - 24:16)
so i had the expectations and maybe that (24:14 - 24:18)
was bad on me that this dialga fight was (24:16 - 24:20)
going to be different (24:18 - 24:22)
than everything up to this point (24:20 - 24:25)
and i i i threw ramen at it for two (24:22 - 24:26)
minutes (24:25 - 24:28)
and then i captured it and i was and (24:26 - 24:30)
then credits rolled and i was like (24:28 - 24:33)
this this was the end of that game why (24:30 - 24:36)
and i was like i was like twitch chat do (24:33 - 24:39)
what ha do i don't get to battle it and (24:36 - 24:41)
their answer was you did it too fast so (24:39 - 24:43)
it was over before it prompted you a (24:41 - 24:46)
battle (24:43 - 24:46)
and i will say that that that (24:52 - 24:58)
is my biggest complaint about the noble (24:56 - 25:01)
battles is (24:58 - 25:03)
it wasn't hard-coded to do a pokemon (25:01 - 25:06)
battle but i did have to do a big battle (25:03 - 25:07)
at the end (25:06 - 25:10)
i did have to do this whole this whole (25:07 - 25:11)
thing (25:10 - 25:13)
to deal with the new threat which i had (25:11 - 25:16)
picked yeah palkia was the one that i (25:13 - 25:18)
was fighting at the very end (25:16 - 25:19)
um (25:18 - 25:20)
and i do think (25:19 - 25:22)
like (25:20 - 25:25)
i was very invested in the theme so when (25:22 - 25:27)
i got kicked out and seeing the two (25:25 - 25:28)
clans come together and be like we have (25:27 - 25:30)
to do this in super secret squirrel way (25:28 - 25:32)
and like them working together behind (25:30 - 25:35)
the scenes felt like my gym leader (25:32 - 25:36)
moment from (25:35 - 25:38)
from black and white like here are these (25:36 - 25:41)
two people who have consistently been (25:38 - 25:44)
against working together who who (25:41 - 25:45)
understand that (25:44 - 25:47)
i am being wronged that the region is in (25:45 - 25:49)
danger and they are definitely putting (25:47 - 25:52)
everything aside to get this done and do (25:49 - 25:54)
what needs to be done and then it leads (25:52 - 25:57)
up to what for me was a very epic battle (25:54 - 25:59)
like it was tough (25:57 - 26:01)
i (25:59 - 26:03)
should have maybe thought more about (26:01 - 26:05)
what was gonna happen but yeah i had to (26:03 - 26:07)
fight and i did fight and it was a big (26:05 - 26:09)
thing and i had a lot of fun and then it (26:07 - 26:11)
was like yeah i caught it and credit (26:09 - 26:13)
troll and it felt (26:11 - 26:15)
like i had earned a festival because i (26:13 - 26:17)
had done a big thing and i i will (26:15 - 26:19)
absolutely say that (26:17 - 26:21)
that needed to be hard-coded that needed (26:19 - 26:24)
to not be skippable i think that i think (26:21 - 26:26)
that should have been for all the noble (26:24 - 26:29)
battles i i you know on the first (26:26 - 26:30)
impressions i said the noble battles (26:29 - 26:32)
were some of the worst parts of this (26:30 - 26:33)
game (26:32 - 26:34)
uh (26:33 - 26:35)
and (26:34 - 26:37)
it's funny because when irene did the (26:35 - 26:39)
cleaver battle i was like hey how'd you (26:37 - 26:41)
feel about like cleaver and she was like (26:39 - 26:42)
oh i just stood at the corner of the (26:41 - 26:44)
tree and he couldn't hit me and i just (26:42 - 26:46)
threw i just threw packets at him and i (26:44 - 26:48)
laughed because she cheesed it the way (26:46 - 26:50)
like i cheesed it which was like i (26:48 - 26:51)
wasn't cheesing it because it was hard i (26:50 - 26:53)
was just like i bet i could cheese this (26:51 - 26:55)
and like yeah you can you can choose it (26:53 - 26:57)
very easily (26:55 - 26:58)
um (26:57 - 26:59)
i don't know how she felt about the (26:58 - 27:00)
lilgam battle (26:59 - 27:02)
um but (27:00 - 27:04)
uh (27:02 - 27:06)
real real quick on the noble battles i (27:04 - 27:08)
actually think if all the noble battles (27:06 - 27:11)
were similar to avalog (27:08 - 27:13)
i would have had a very (27:11 - 27:15)
i i would feel very different about (27:13 - 27:17)
those battles because i think the avalon (27:15 - 27:19)
battle is actually really good (27:17 - 27:22)
uh it puts you in a position where (27:19 - 27:24)
it it's it teaches you the mechanics (27:22 - 27:26)
like right away like avalon has this (27:24 - 27:28)
attack now he has this attack now he has (27:26 - 27:30)
this attack and halfway through that (27:28 - 27:32)
battle he starts merging those two (27:30 - 27:34)
attacks and i really don't think the (27:32 - 27:36)
noble battles up to that point really (27:34 - 27:38)
taught you (27:36 - 27:41)
in a way where it felt fair (27:38 - 27:42)
um (27:41 - 27:43)
and (27:42 - 27:45)
the avalon battle (27:43 - 27:47)
is the one battle where you felt like oh (27:45 - 27:50)
i do want to actually use my pokemon (27:47 - 27:52)
in between (27:50 - 27:53)
where (27:52 - 27:54)
the the cleaver battle did not feel that (27:53 - 27:56)
way the little game battle definitely (27:54 - 27:58)
didn't feel that way especially if your (27:56 - 28:00)
cleaver battle went like poorly you're (27:58 - 28:01)
like why would i ever throw out my (28:00 - 28:03)
pokemon it's faster just to roman it to (28:01 - 28:06)
death the arcanine one is (28:03 - 28:08)
the one that is actually unfair (28:06 - 28:11)
and yeah at least the like cleaver and (28:08 - 28:13)
the the liligant and i would say the (28:11 - 28:16)
electrode rely on like skill and no luck (28:13 - 28:18)
there's no luck to that it's just (28:16 - 28:20)
can you dodge properly the arcanine one (28:18 - 28:22)
can either be the easiest one or the (28:20 - 28:24)
hardest one because arcanine will lock (28:22 - 28:26)
the center of the arena (28:24 - 28:28)
and then he will he will either he will (28:26 - 28:30)
pick one of the four quadrants to stand (28:28 - 28:33)
in to do his like ultimate fireball (28:30 - 28:34)
attack (28:33 - 28:36)
and if he picks the one farthest away (28:34 - 28:39)
from you it is significantly harder (28:36 - 28:40)
still doable (28:39 - 28:42)
but significantly harder versus if he (28:40 - 28:44)
picks the one you're in (28:42 - 28:46)
because if he picks the one you're in (28:44 - 28:48)
you you can't miss him he's right in (28:46 - 28:51)
front of you just robbing him until (28:48 - 28:53)
there's a thing that they don't tell you (28:51 - 28:55)
about and they don't tell you about it (28:53 - 28:57)
until the avalog one (28:55 - 28:59)
but when you do the dodge you gain (28:57 - 29:00)
invulnerability no they tell you that (28:59 - 29:03)
for little again do they i appreciate (29:00 - 29:04)
they don't but you can dot you can jump (29:03 - 29:06)
into the center and then jump again so (29:04 - 29:09)
that fire in there you have to jump (29:06 - 29:11)
through twice and you'll never get hurt (29:09 - 29:13)
because you have that invulnerability (29:11 - 29:15)
for the split second and you can hit y (29:13 - 29:16)
again so (29:15 - 29:18)
it's not great at telling you that (29:16 - 29:20)
because it looks like i'll just get hurt (29:18 - 29:22)
which i do think the arcanite fight is (29:20 - 29:24)
frustrating (29:22 - 29:25)
i was so (29:24 - 29:27)
angry at it (29:25 - 29:31)
i was like this is nonsense but i the (29:27 - 29:32)
like the second time i did it i realized (29:31 - 29:34)
oh the invulnerability thing's there so (29:32 - 29:36)
if i jump in the center then jump out (29:34 - 29:38)
again i won't get hit by the fire circle (29:36 - 29:40)
and i can close the gap but the game (29:38 - 29:43)
isn't great at telling you that (29:40 - 29:44)
uh no (29:43 - 29:46)
and there was a there was an interview (29:44 - 29:47)
with like miyamoto (29:46 - 29:50)
uh about like mario games and how (29:47 - 29:52)
a mario game will walk you like we'll (29:50 - 29:54)
teach you something and then the next (29:52 - 29:55)
level will teach you something and then (29:54 - 29:57)
the next level will teach you something (29:55 - 29:59)
and then the final level you have to use (29:57 - 30:00)
everything you've learned (29:59 - 30:02)
and put that together yeah and the (30:00 - 30:05)
avalon battle does that yeah (30:02 - 30:08)
no other the diago one or the palkia one (30:05 - 30:10)
i'm sure they're the same the the wrote (30:08 - 30:13)
the electrode no they don't really teach (30:10 - 30:16)
you the the pattern that you're supposed (30:13 - 30:18)
to learn it's just (30:16 - 30:19)
you learn it by like getting hit like (30:18 - 30:21)
three or four times and being like ah (30:19 - 30:23)
well i can't get hit one more time and i (30:21 - 30:25)
don't think anyone i i don't think any (30:23 - 30:27)
of them were hard (30:25 - 30:29)
apparently i did the diago one so fast (30:27 - 30:31)
that i i didn't even get an opportunity (30:29 - 30:32)
to battle the pokemon which is (30:31 - 30:34)
frustrating um (30:32 - 30:36)
but i don't think any i i don't think (30:34 - 30:38)
any of them are hard but just because i (30:36 - 30:40)
did it easier than other people i don't (30:38 - 30:42)
think people should feel bad that they (30:40 - 30:43)
failed it because i think a lot of it is (30:42 - 30:45)
is really unfair it's like when people (30:43 - 30:48)
say dark souls is hard and it's like (30:45 - 30:51)
this moment's not hard this moment is (30:48 - 30:53)
just you didn't know existed and because (30:51 - 30:54)
you turned the corner and you got your (30:53 - 30:56)
you got (30:54 - 30:57)
killed (30:56 - 31:00)
was because it was a surprise factor (30:57 - 31:01)
like you shouldn't feel bad that you (31:00 - 31:04)
died there you just didn't know i mean (31:01 - 31:05)
it's what (31:04 - 31:08)
you know i it's final fantasy 14 first (31:05 - 31:10)
day first patch day (31:08 - 31:12)
nobody knows how to do the dungeons (31:10 - 31:15)
and you all wipe on the bus and then a (31:12 - 31:16)
week later you've done them so many (31:15 - 31:18)
times you know the patterns that they're (31:16 - 31:20)
a breeze like it (31:18 - 31:23)
learning the pattern is part of the game (31:20 - 31:25)
like you have to learn what it's going (31:23 - 31:27)
to do and (31:25 - 31:29)
once you know the pattern is designed to (31:27 - 31:32)
not be hard at that point and i would i (31:29 - 31:35)
would never fault anyone for for (31:32 - 31:36)
picking up where they left off like if (31:35 - 31:40)
you if you died at 25 health left just (31:36 - 31:42)
don't feel bad picking like they're not (31:40 - 31:43)
like (31:42 - 31:44)
if it's fun (31:43 - 31:47)
then restart at full health like when i (31:44 - 31:48)
when i (31:47 - 31:49)
i i (31:48 - 31:52)
i died to the arcanine once and then i (31:49 - 31:55)
died to diago once and the arcanine one (31:52 - 31:56)
i died because i thought you were (31:55 - 31:58)
supposed to aim for the fireballs of his (31:56 - 32:00)
head yeah and so when i aimed up for the (31:58 - 32:02)
first three they disappeared but that's (32:00 - 32:04)
because the ramen like fell on top of (32:02 - 32:06)
them and i didn't notice but it went (32:04 - 32:08)
through the ball so i was like oh that's (32:06 - 32:09)
what you have to do and then i'm aiming (32:08 - 32:10)
for like the fourth and fifth and it's (32:09 - 32:12)
like not working because now it's (32:10 - 32:14)
missing arcanine (32:12 - 32:15)
and i'm like where am i supposed to (32:14 - 32:17)
you're supposed to aim for the arcanine (32:15 - 32:20)
and then the diagonal one i i died (32:17 - 32:22)
with it like 10 health first time doing (32:20 - 32:24)
it and i restarted at full health (32:22 - 32:26)
because i was like you know that was (32:24 - 32:27)
kind of fun i bet i can definitely do it (32:26 - 32:30)
this time but like i would never be like (32:27 - 32:33)
oh you didn't you didn't restart at full (32:30 - 32:34)
health you're like if you're not having (32:33 - 32:37)
fun with it just just finish it it's not (32:34 - 32:39)
that big of a deal (32:37 - 32:41)
which is what i am (32:39 - 32:43)
but like again i guess i really wanted (32:41 - 32:46)
an ultra necrozma moment (32:43 - 32:49)
especially with dialga or whichever the (32:46 - 32:51)
final one was yeah and i didn't get that (32:49 - 32:53)
and to me that's why i (32:51 - 32:55)
really like it it was hard for me on (32:53 - 32:57)
stream but like i see credits and (32:55 - 32:59)
everyone's like how'd you like it and i (32:57 - 33:00)
was like (32:59 - 33:02)
i didn't like it (33:00 - 33:03)
yeah (33:02 - 33:04)
i mean (33:03 - 33:07)
and i like it it's frustrating that it (33:04 - 33:09)
wasn't a hard-coded moment (33:07 - 33:11)
because i was watching that stream when (33:09 - 33:12)
you did that and i'm like (33:11 - 33:14)
[Music] (33:12 - 33:15)
we had (33:14 - 33:18)
vastly different experiences and that it (33:15 - 33:20)
stinks that you got a worse experience (33:18 - 33:23)
and it the game shouldn't have allowed (33:20 - 33:25)
that because this for me it was an (33:23 - 33:27)
alternate charisma (33:25 - 33:30)
moment it was a oop (33:27 - 33:32)
i don't know what actual moves it has (33:30 - 33:33)
and my team (33:32 - 33:35)
is being run over i don't even know (33:33 - 33:37)
where the level is supposed to be at (33:35 - 33:39)
75 i'm guessing (33:37 - 33:42)
oh i don't remember 70 i think (33:39 - 33:43)
because alternate chromosome was what (33:42 - 33:47)
65.70 it was much tougher than the e4 (33:43 - 33:49)
it's either 65 or 70. i don't remember i (33:47 - 33:51)
have to look again (33:49 - 33:54)
but i i mean i was under leveled and i i (33:51 - 33:57)
really didn't think about (33:54 - 33:59)
i thought it was a master ball moment i (33:57 - 34:00)
thought it would come out we created (33:59 - 34:02)
this ball and i just throw the ball so (34:00 - 34:04)
when i went into a thing and i'm like i (34:02 - 34:06)
don't know why i expected it maybe just (34:04 - 34:09)
throwing a ball (34:06 - 34:09)
my only question with that last battle (34:09 - 34:14)
is (34:12 - 34:17)
where did the bombs come from (34:14 - 34:18)
they just magically appeared we didn't (34:17 - 34:21)
make bombs for palkia (34:18 - 34:22)
but they just (34:21 - 34:25)
the bombs the robin packets i'm using (34:22 - 34:29)
the correct name the bombs (34:25 - 34:30)
it's like all of a sudden you have a (34:29 - 34:32)
bunch of bombs (34:30 - 34:34)
uh the person that you so (34:32 - 34:36)
the person that you d it's a throw off (34:34 - 34:39)
line but the person that you didn't (34:36 - 34:41)
choose to go around the rest of the to (34:39 - 34:44)
go to the so you're enough for me yeah (34:41 - 34:48)
they say oh i'm gonna go research (34:44 - 34:50)
elsewhere and shows up to the final (34:48 - 34:52)
battle with with the things uh that's (34:50 - 34:54)
what they're doing while you are getting (34:52 - 34:57)
the um the lake trees all right that (34:54 - 34:59)
puts it together for me so well you also (34:57 - 35:01)
didn't like the ending (34:59 - 35:03)
i mean i didn't (35:01 - 35:06)
i i it's really hard to say (35:03 - 35:08)
i (35:06 - 35:11)
had a bad experience overall with the (35:08 - 35:14)
game but that is less about the game (35:11 - 35:16)
than more about the people that i (35:14 - 35:18)
interact with all the time who kind of (35:16 - 35:22)
ruined the experience for me um (35:18 - 35:24)
it's like it it honestly the animal (35:22 - 35:25)
feels like (35:24 - 35:27)
that's part of it that i don't want to (35:25 - 35:29)
be in a pokemon community anymore (35:27 - 35:31)
because if everybody's got to throw (35:29 - 35:33)
everything in my face all the time it (35:31 - 35:35)
ruins the games for me and it's not only (35:33 - 35:37)
like the the animal crossing thing was (35:35 - 35:39)
part of it and i will say (35:37 - 35:41)
i almost feel like my game is broken (35:39 - 35:44)
because guess what bojin (35:41 - 35:46)
has not evolved (35:44 - 35:48)
and i have finished the game (35:46 - 35:49)
and you guys have gone through a whole (35:48 - 35:50)
story (35:49 - 35:53)
with the worm bull going into a casket (35:50 - 35:55)
and a silcoon and (35:53 - 35:57)
no not that has not you just have to (35:55 - 35:59)
like talk to him every now and then i do (35:57 - 36:01)
especially after after you guys started (35:59 - 36:03)
talking about that all he says is (36:01 - 36:04)
uh (36:03 - 36:06)
something about like oh the the nobles (36:04 - 36:08)
are really powerful and you keep saying (36:06 - 36:10)
that over and over did you talk to (36:08 - 36:11)
beaujean (36:10 - 36:14)
yes hmm i talked to both of them but (36:11 - 36:15)
also has to be like a dex thing where (36:14 - 36:17)
like you got to get warm to like level (36:15 - 36:20)
10 or something i'm working out but also (36:17 - 36:23)
i i feel my game is broken because i did (36:20 - 36:25)
not have an outbreak (36:23 - 36:28)
until i unlocked the fourth area i did (36:25 - 36:31)
not have a single outbreak weird there (36:28 - 36:32)
were some people like that that's a (36:31 - 36:34)
frequent question in my into my twitch (36:32 - 36:35)
size like i haven't got an outbreak yet (36:34 - 36:37)
and i was like oh you have to like kind (36:35 - 36:38)
of force it you kind of have to keep (36:37 - 36:40)
going in and out of jail i was i was (36:38 - 36:42)
yeah because i kept doing the little (36:40 - 36:44)
side missions but the other thing like (36:42 - 36:46)
about like being in the community that (36:44 - 36:49)
ruined it is like people (36:46 - 36:50)
just (36:49 - 36:53)
say things without thinking (36:50 - 36:54)
oh hey (36:53 - 36:56)
maybe somebody didn't want to hear that (36:54 - 36:59)
so like when i was finishing the game (36:56 - 37:00)
yesterday (36:59 - 37:02)
and i was talking to somebody on (37:00 - 37:04)
facetime and i'm like oh i'm just about (37:02 - 37:05)
to (37:04 - 37:08)
uh do the final thing you know i've made (37:05 - 37:10)
this magical ball and he said oh yeah (37:08 - 37:12)
that's just like all the yellow ones (37:10 - 37:14)
it's gonna be like all the yellow ones i (37:12 - 37:16)
was like well great (37:14 - 37:19)
no surprise all the nobles (37:16 - 37:20)
he's like that battle is going to be (37:19 - 37:22)
like the nobles i see what you're saying (37:20 - 37:26)
and i was like oh well now i i okay (37:22 - 37:28)
you know thank you but for me it was (37:26 - 37:28)
like (37:28 - 37:31)
death by a thousand cuts because i had (37:28 - 37:32)
so (37:31 - 37:34)
many experiences like that you know i (37:32 - 37:36)
was talking to somebody and like oh i'm (37:34 - 37:38)
i'm in the third area and they're like (37:36 - 37:40)
oh yeah i'm there too i'm preparing this (37:38 - 37:43)
this and this for back ski leech (37:40 - 37:45)
but you didn't have to tell me that so (37:43 - 37:46)
that i could enjoy that part of the (37:45 - 37:47)
story (37:46 - 37:49)
yeah no i know where you're coming from (37:47 - 37:52)
it's it's hard to as like a streamer of (37:49 - 37:53)
you know people coming in like trying to (37:52 - 37:55)
tell you how to play or like did you do (37:53 - 37:57)
this yet did you do this yeah like i was (37:55 - 37:58)
watching a streamer (37:57 - 38:00)
um before the game of like the night the (37:58 - 38:02)
game came out you know i wasn't playing (38:00 - 38:03)
until the next game i was watching the (38:02 - 38:05)
streamer and like their chat was like i (38:03 - 38:06)
can't wait till you get to that ponytalk (38:05 - 38:08)
quest you should just do the ponyta (38:06 - 38:10)
quest hey once you get the ponyta quest (38:08 - 38:13)
you should do it and it's like (38:10 - 38:16)
like even that ruins it for somebody (38:13 - 38:18)
because you're like why like what makes (38:16 - 38:20)
this quest so special and obviously when (38:18 - 38:21)
you when you get you're like oh it's a (38:20 - 38:23)
sh like (38:21 - 38:26)
it it's we it's like a weird like they (38:23 - 38:28)
like you can backseat by like telling (38:26 - 38:30)
somebody (38:28 - 38:31)
what they should be doing which don't (38:30 - 38:33)
backseat but you can also like (38:31 - 38:35)
indirectly back seat by being like just (38:33 - 38:37)
by being like hey do this quest you need (38:35 - 38:38)
to do this quest that's going to give (38:37 - 38:40)
you something good and it's like that is (38:38 - 38:42)
also still backseating i very much have (38:40 - 38:45)
tried to get into the habit of asking (38:42 - 38:48)
people where are you at (38:45 - 38:50)
what's the last thing you did so that i (38:48 - 38:52)
know what i can and cannot talk to i (38:50 - 38:54)
also because i will still say i don't (38:52 - 38:57)
know the actual ending of this game i (38:54 - 38:59)
have my thoughts about it but i've also (38:57 - 39:01)
been opening people were like hey have (38:59 - 39:03)
you been playing (39:01 - 39:05)
have you been enjoying arceus and i (39:03 - 39:07)
always say this following sentence i (39:05 - 39:08)
like it a lot (39:07 - 39:12)
please don't tell me (39:08 - 39:12)
anything about the game unless you know (39:12 - 39:17)
where i'm at anything that i've (39:15 - 39:19)
crossed is fair game but if you're (39:17 - 39:21)
farther than me i don't want i don't (39:19 - 39:23)
want to talk i mean i'm just i see (39:21 - 39:25)
things people are posting on social (39:23 - 39:27)
media and stuff like that and it's (39:25 - 39:29)
uh i i got it i've been in a pretty (39:27 - 39:31)
heavy twitter (39:29 - 39:33)
blackout (39:31 - 39:35)
i saw i saw a name of something that i (39:33 - 39:37)
don't know which i'm like (39:35 - 39:39)
i don't know what that is and i'm (39:37 - 39:41)
tempted to look it up but i'm not going (39:39 - 39:42)
to (39:41 - 39:45)
i'm just going to ignore it and run into (39:42 - 39:48)
it when i run into it i would say also (39:45 - 39:50)
like for me personally if i was in a (39:48 - 39:53)
vacuum if i was in a complete space with (39:50 - 39:54)
without other people around (39:53 - 39:56)
i probably would have taken three to six (39:54 - 39:58)
months to complete this game (39:56 - 40:00)
because knowing the way that i would (39:58 - 40:03)
enjoy playing it i would do area one and (40:00 - 40:06)
i would thoroughly do everything in area (40:03 - 40:07)
because this is like the same way that i (40:06 - 40:09)
do regular games right yeah and then (40:07 - 40:11)
like when i get to area two and unlock (40:09 - 40:13)
something that allows me to explore area (40:11 - 40:16)
one more i'd go back to area one again (40:13 - 40:18)
and do even more and just keep going (40:16 - 40:19)
back and forth and not even worry about (40:18 - 40:21)
progressing the story (40:19 - 40:23)
in any kind of a (40:21 - 40:25)
rapid way (40:23 - 40:28)
but so many people are just like so like (40:25 - 40:30)
adamant about pushing this that and that (40:28 - 40:31)
i was like well (40:30 - 40:33)
it's really going to be ruined for me if (40:31 - 40:34)
i try to take as much time as i would (40:33 - 40:35)
want (40:34 - 40:37)
yeah and that's why like normally when i (40:35 - 40:39)
play through a pokemon game i'm like i'm (40:37 - 40:41)
just gonna focus on the a storyline i'm (40:39 - 40:43)
gonna get through it as fast as possible (40:41 - 40:45)
and then i don't feel stressed of like (40:43 - 40:47)
did you know that lysander was the (40:45 - 40:49)
villain well i didn't need to beat the (40:47 - 40:50)
game to know that it was pretty obvious (40:49 - 40:52)
within the first hour of the game but (40:50 - 40:54)
you know (40:52 - 40:56)
i mean i have a very strong suspicion of (40:54 - 40:58)
who the actual villain of this game is (40:56 - 41:01)
but i have a suspicion myself yeah (40:58 - 41:03)
um and there are things that were (41:01 - 41:05)
spoiled for me on you know i did look up (41:03 - 41:07)
spoilers before the game came out (41:05 - 41:08)
specifically pokemon and i was (41:07 - 41:10)
accidentally spoiled that was my bad on (41:08 - 41:13)
other stuff um (41:10 - 41:14)
and and (41:13 - 41:16)
i still think that like for me the game (41:14 - 41:18)
was still shocking and surprising in (41:16 - 41:20)
moments and surprisingly the ingo stuff (41:18 - 41:23)
was not spoiled at all and that was (41:20 - 41:25)
because nobody knows who ingo was so (41:23 - 41:27)
they didn't care (41:25 - 41:28)
uh and that was like a such a cool (41:27 - 41:30)
moment for me and it was cool to see (41:28 - 41:32)
like benny be a ninja and stuff and that (41:30 - 41:34)
was like cool i mean his dialogue kind (41:32 - 41:36)
of like was like oh okay whatever you're (41:34 - 41:37)
like just well you know (41:36 - 41:39)
ninja oleana right now (41:37 - 41:41)
and maybe the oleana rose thing wouldn't (41:39 - 41:42)
bother me so much if that wasn't like (41:41 - 41:45)
the last pokemon game of like (41:42 - 41:48)
this is the same exact thing but i get (41:45 - 41:50)
it it's just yeah it's (41:48 - 41:52)
the i mean (41:50 - 41:55)
i actually (41:52 - 41:55)
when when i ran into ingo (41:55 - 42:01)
i actually yelled out loud and prince (41:58 - 42:03)
like why is this important i'm like i (42:01 - 42:05)
can't even explain it to you (42:03 - 42:08)
it means a lot to me right now (42:05 - 42:11)
i'm having a moment (42:08 - 42:12)
um (42:11 - 42:14)
i wanna i think i think we i wanted to (42:12 - 42:16)
talk about nobles i think we i think we (42:14 - 42:19)
did that um (42:16 - 42:19)
i i want to switch gears a little bit to (42:19 - 42:24)
the like the things i really like about (42:22 - 42:27)
this game um and it's just it's it's (42:24 - 42:29)
just the overall (42:27 - 42:31)
fluidity (42:29 - 42:32)
is that a word (42:31 - 42:34)
yes how fluid the game is (42:32 - 42:36)
um (42:34 - 42:37)
the (42:36 - 42:40)
it's just fun to play and i i think that (42:37 - 42:41)
like (42:40 - 42:43)
graphically the game is bad (42:41 - 42:46)
uh and i really confirmed this when you (42:43 - 42:47)
get to the water sorry you also ruined (42:46 - 42:49)
that for me because it's like things (42:47 - 42:50)
that i wouldn't care about all of a (42:49 - 42:52)
sudden i started looking for (42:50 - 42:55)
okay it's so hard to avoid the pokeball (42:52 - 42:57)
in the water i would not i would not (42:55 - 43:00)
have noticed i would not have looked i (42:57 - 43:02)
wouldn't have cared (43:00 - 43:04)
you could literally count the pixels of (43:02 - 43:06)
that pokeball it's fine though right (43:04 - 43:07)
like you know i played ultrasound on the (43:06 - 43:10)
graphics aside (43:07 - 43:13)
like the graphics are bad and um i think (43:10 - 43:15)
the battle system is still bad (43:13 - 43:19)
but the overall going into an open world (43:15 - 43:20)
ish (43:19 - 43:24)
open world-ish catching pokemon (43:20 - 43:27)
farming items and that loop is very (43:24 - 43:30)
satisfying and very great and i think (43:27 - 43:33)
somebody did a did a time test (43:30 - 43:35)
and they they they caught one pokemon in (43:33 - 43:37)
brilliant diamond shining pearl and in (43:35 - 43:39)
that time of start and finish of (43:37 - 43:42)
catching that one pokemon they caught 12 (43:39 - 43:44)
pokemon in legends (43:42 - 43:47)
and (43:44 - 43:48)
i think the other thing about legends (43:47 - 43:50)
that i really like and probably people (43:48 - 43:52)
will disagree with is i like that you (43:50 - 43:54)
just don't have to actually battle (43:52 - 43:55)
pokemon and i've talked about this (43:54 - 43:57)
before on let's go and i talked about it (43:55 - 43:58)
last week but (43:57 - 44:01)
you can catch every pokemon (43:58 - 44:03)
without ever going into battle you can (44:01 - 44:05)
use the mud you can use the apricorns (44:03 - 44:07)
you can use the goopy sticky whatever (44:05 - 44:09)
that thing is called (44:07 - 44:11)
and i would rather sit in the grass for (44:09 - 44:14)
like a minute to like wait for them to (44:11 - 44:16)
calm down or to wait for them to turn (44:14 - 44:17)
around than to start a battle i know in (44:16 - 44:20)
my head that the starting the battle and (44:17 - 44:23)
doing the battle would be faster (44:20 - 44:25)
but i just have so much more enjoyment (44:23 - 44:27)
like waiting for him to turn around (44:25 - 44:29)
throwing a smoke bomb walking up (44:27 - 44:30)
like (44:29 - 44:34)
i don't know why i don't know what part (44:30 - 44:37)
of that it's where you're at right like (44:34 - 44:39)
and it's the noises i think too like the (44:37 - 44:40)
like (44:39 - 44:42)
isn't there wasn't there a study of like (44:40 - 44:43)
how (44:42 - 44:45)
certain noises (44:43 - 44:46)
like that's why like text tones are the (44:45 - 44:48)
way they are ringtones are the way they (44:46 - 44:50)
are but like that noise when you (44:48 - 44:53)
backstab a pokemon with a pokeball is so (44:50 - 44:56)
satisfying yeah i (44:53 - 44:58)
i'm just i love hearing it and i love (44:56 - 45:01)
doing it it's it's like um (44:58 - 45:03)
it's like the even like the like (45:01 - 45:05)
headshot slayer or whatever in halo like (45:03 - 45:08)
it was very like oh my god like it felt (45:05 - 45:09)
good and killzone had that too it looked (45:08 - 45:11)
like it was very affirming they did a (45:09 - 45:14)
good job of there's the normal sound and (45:11 - 45:16)
then there's the back sound and like (45:14 - 45:19)
it's louder it's brighter it's a (45:16 - 45:21)
different tone it is a it is (45:19 - 45:24)
very congratulatory (45:21 - 45:26)
and yeah it is they did a great sound (45:24 - 45:27)
design (45:26 - 45:30)
uh i could care less (45:27 - 45:33)
i just if i'm there to catch it like if (45:30 - 45:34)
you're be i don't want to i don't i (45:33 - 45:36)
don't want to scroll through and find (45:34 - 45:38)
the thing (45:36 - 45:40)
i have pokemon with me for a reason (45:38 - 45:42)
let's just fight (45:40 - 45:46)
because i am tired of this garbage (45:42 - 45:46)
yeah i think i think the (45:46 - 45:50)
the thing we also didn't talk about is (45:48 - 45:52)
just like the movement between stantler (45:50 - 45:56)
tabasco legion to bravery is fantastic (45:52 - 45:59)
brilliant uh and it just feels (45:56 - 46:02)
it it's like they took everything from (45:59 - 46:04)
sun and moon and ultra sun and moon and (46:02 - 46:06)
they just they just figured it out they (46:04 - 46:09)
just got it yeah and like we always talk (46:06 - 46:11)
about how this company can't get the (46:09 - 46:13)
internet stuff right (46:11 - 46:16)
from wycombe to festival plaza to (46:13 - 46:20)
the pss to whatever like it (46:16 - 46:22)
sometimes it's better sometimes it's (46:20 - 46:23)
worse (46:22 - 46:25)
there's a lot of things in this game (46:23 - 46:26)
that are just (46:25 - 46:30)
better yeah um and that's and that's (46:26 - 46:32)
great battle system is not one of them (46:30 - 46:34)
i i mean i again i mentioned this before (46:32 - 46:38)
i i get very excited to play this game (46:34 - 46:41)
um i am curious (46:38 - 46:43)
i i've been trying to start this out i (46:41 - 46:47)
am curious how much of my (46:43 - 46:47)
super excitement is from how frustrated (46:48 - 46:53)
i felt with brilliant diamond shining (46:51 - 46:54)
pearl (46:53 - 46:57)
and i'm one like i i'm wondering how (46:54 - 46:59)
much (46:57 - 47:01)
going from sort if i went from sword and (46:59 - 47:03)
shield straight to this game (47:01 - 47:05)
what that experience would have been (47:03 - 47:06)
like (47:05 - 47:08)
um and i don't i i've been sort of like (47:06 - 47:09)
thinking about i don't have a good (47:08 - 47:11)
answer for that i still think i would (47:09 - 47:14)
really really love this game but i and (47:11 - 47:17)
part of me is also like (47:14 - 47:17)
i can't possibly fathom playing (47:18 - 47:23)
brilliant diamond shining pro right now (47:20 - 47:25)
i just can't (47:23 - 47:27)
um (47:25 - 47:27)
i and i again i like i said i want to (47:28 - 47:32)
put this game in my other switch and (47:30 - 47:34)
start all over again and catch all the (47:32 - 47:36)
things that i that i didn't catch the (47:34 - 47:38)
first time to really understand a lot of (47:36 - 47:40)
what was happening in the story (47:38 - 47:42)
and in the world and really see what (47:40 - 47:44)
they're pointing to but i still have a (47:42 - 47:46)
lot to do in the game that i'm actively (47:44 - 47:49)
playing because i know i'm not at the (47:46 - 47:50)
end of the game (47:49 - 47:53)
um because the the very first thing (47:50 - 47:55)
you're commanded to do as i said to (47:53 - 47:56)
logan (47:55 - 47:58)
i'm like i haven't done the very thing i (47:56 - 48:00)
was told to do when i fell into this (47:58 - 48:02)
world (48:00 - 48:04)
so i know the game can't be done because (48:02 - 48:07)
i was told i had to do it and i didn't (48:04 - 48:09)
do it at credits although every pokemon (48:07 - 48:12)
game does tell you to do that but i (48:09 - 48:14)
don't but not every pokemon game has a (48:12 - 48:16)
god-like pokemon commanding me through a (48:14 - 48:19)
text message if you were to go back and (48:16 - 48:21)
listen to i think the sun and moon (48:19 - 48:23)
series or maybe it was the ultra sun (48:21 - 48:24)
moon series that we did (48:23 - 48:28)
i i i remember saying like there is no (48:24 - 48:29)
reason (48:28 - 48:32)
to ever catch more than one pokemon (48:29 - 48:34)
because (48:32 - 48:35)
there's not (48:34 - 48:38)
you you go and you catch a fur fruit and (48:35 - 48:39)
you have it you go and you catch an (48:38 - 48:41)
oricorio and you have it you go and you (48:39 - 48:43)
catch a grubbin and you evolve it to a (48:41 - 48:45)
charger bug and you evolve it to a (48:43 - 48:47)
vicovult you have no reason to ever (48:45 - 48:49)
catch that again and before anyone was (48:47 - 48:51)
like well what about competitive (48:49 - 48:53)
if you were into competitive you would (48:51 - 48:55)
catch that one pokemon you would head to (48:53 - 48:57)
the daycare and then you would breed (48:55 - 48:59)
because there's there's no reward for (48:57 - 49:05)
catching random wild pokemon and (48:59 - 49:06)
in (49:05 - 49:09)
let's go pikachu let's go eevee they (49:06 - 49:11)
gave you reasons (49:09 - 49:13)
to catch (49:11 - 49:16)
po more than one (49:13 - 49:18)
um because that's how that was how you (49:16 - 49:20)
got experience they gave you a reason (49:18 - 49:21)
and i think that's what they were (49:20 - 49:22)
struggling with (49:21 - 49:24)
all of these years (49:22 - 49:25)
of like (49:24 - 49:28)
for a game about catching pokemon you (49:25 - 49:31)
sure don't do a lot of it i i would (49:28 - 49:33)
imagine that like somebody who doesn't (49:31 - 49:35)
care about completing the pokedex but (49:33 - 49:37)
somebody who buys the pokemon game to (49:35 - 49:39)
experience the eight gyms the elite four (49:37 - 49:40)
and the credits (49:39 - 49:42)
i would imagine they probably catch less (49:40 - 49:44)
than 50 pokemon i would imagine that (49:42 - 49:48)
like the the pokemon that they catch (49:44 - 49:50)
they keep on their team and they rarely (49:48 - 49:52)
change because that was another problem (49:50 - 49:55)
with this series early on like in black (49:52 - 49:57)
and white if you if you if four if five (49:55 - 50:00)
of your pokemon are at level 40 and you (49:57 - 50:02)
want to add a new pokemon and it's level (50:00 - 50:04)
14 (50:02 - 50:06)
good luck in the last two gyms to get (50:04 - 50:08)
that pokemon up to level unless you want (50:06 - 50:11)
to grind audino and a normal i just want (50:08 - 50:13)
to play this game and you know move back (50:11 - 50:14)
to fortnite when i'm done a normal (50:13 - 50:17)
person isn't going to (50:14 - 50:19)
grind audino to get that pokemon up (50:17 - 50:20)
right (50:19 - 50:22)
uh (50:20 - 50:24)
i some will like if they really yeah (50:22 - 50:26)
maybe some well but like you know x and (50:24 - 50:27)
y kind of solve that with you know (50:26 - 50:29)
everyone's getting xp and there's like (50:27 - 50:31)
rubber banding so they've made all of (50:29 - 50:34)
these changes over the year (50:31 - 50:36)
years you know throughout the the 25 (50:34 - 50:37)
years of (50:36 - 50:39)
making these games they just seem to get (50:37 - 50:41)
better and better and better and more (50:39 - 50:43)
accessible and like (50:41 - 50:45)
hey do you want to do you actually want (50:43 - 50:47)
to complete a pokedex do you actually (50:45 - 50:48)
want to understand the battle system do (50:47 - 50:49)
you actually want to make it to the end (50:48 - 50:52)
to like see the credits do you actually (50:49 - 50:53)
want to stick around for post game and (50:52 - 50:56)
maybe shiny hunt or breed or (50:53 - 50:58)
do contests like they've done so many of (50:56 - 51:00)
these things so well (50:58 - 51:02)
and i think let's go was a really great (51:00 - 51:04)
step in like here's a reason why you (51:02 - 51:06)
want to catch more than one mostly (51:04 - 51:08)
because you have to but like hey it's (51:06 - 51:11)
pretty fun and i think this game (51:08 - 51:13)
really solidifies that of like (51:11 - 51:15)
i have probably caught a hundred krika (51:13 - 51:16)
tot (51:15 - 51:18)
but they're they're right there it's (51:16 - 51:20)
easy to throw a pokeball and keep (51:18 - 51:21)
running i know it's probably gonna catch (51:20 - 51:23)
if it doesn't that's okay i'm still (51:21 - 51:24)
running away (51:23 - 51:26)
i'm gonna hear that click sound (51:24 - 51:27)
eventually (51:26 - 51:30)
the the just the concept of (51:27 - 51:32)
catching (51:30 - 51:34)
and moving throughout that world (51:32 - 51:35)
feels (51:34 - 51:38)
incredible and i cannot (51:35 - 51:40)
fathom playing another game that doesn't (51:38 - 51:43)
have that they accomplished it they did (51:40 - 51:44)
it (51:43 - 51:45)
and even though like sword and shield (51:44 - 51:48)
was (51:45 - 51:48)
a step back from let's go in the sense (51:48 - 51:52)
of like kind of going back to like well (51:51 - 51:55)
why do i need to catch five zigzagoons i (51:52 - 51:58)
have one it's good enough (51:55 - 52:00)
sword and shield at least introduced max (51:58 - 52:03)
raid battles which was like (52:00 - 52:05)
i do want to catch these because i'm (52:03 - 52:06)
already here and i'm just throwing one (52:05 - 52:08)
pokeball and why would i not throw the (52:06 - 52:10)
one pokeball right it's like (52:08 - 52:11)
let me just throw the one pokeball cool (52:10 - 52:14)
i caught it and i moved on like (52:11 - 52:16)
they the sword and shield also did the (52:14 - 52:18)
thing which is frustrating that legends (52:16 - 52:20)
doesn't have is like they they have like (52:18 - 52:21)
a (52:20 - 52:24)
stat page where like you've caught 10 (52:21 - 52:26)
000 pokemon you've caught 14 000 pokemon (52:24 - 52:28)
um it shows you how many of a specific (52:26 - 52:31)
pokemon you caught like you caught 500 (52:28 - 52:33)
cramer ant and oddly enough that was the (52:31 - 52:34)
way to shiny hat in that game is by (52:33 - 52:38)
getting those pokemon to 500. like (52:34 - 52:38)
not everyone who plays the pokemon not (52:41 - 52:45)
everyone who plays the pokemon game (52:43 - 52:46)
cares about the battling (52:45 - 52:49)
cares about like competitive cares about (52:46 - 52:52)
like learning what fairy is weak to by (52:49 - 52:53)
the way it's like (52:52 - 52:55)
steel and poison uh (52:53 - 52:56)
yes (52:55 - 52:58)
so (52:56 - 53:00)
to make a game that's so focused on (52:58 - 53:02)
completing the decks (53:00 - 53:03)
and to (53:02 - 53:05)
and to have (53:03 - 53:08)
the decks be way more advanced than (53:05 - 53:11)
you just caught landorus alright that (53:08 - 53:13)
box is checked you're (53:11 - 53:17)
done is something that i feel (53:13 - 53:18)
is important to the franchise going (53:17 - 53:21)
forward i think this advance (53:18 - 53:22)
dex (53:21 - 53:24)
is the actual (53:22 - 53:27)
like takeaway from the game that i feel (53:24 - 53:29)
like people aren't really talking about (53:27 - 53:30)
i i see (53:29 - 53:32)
it's a little frustrating to see (53:30 - 53:34)
and look i get if this is your favorite (53:32 - 53:35)
pokemon game this is your favorite (53:34 - 53:37)
pokemon game but i i do see a bunch of (53:35 - 53:38)
people being like this is the best (53:37 - 53:40)
pokemon game ever made (53:38 - 53:41)
and it's just like (53:40 - 53:43)
debatable you are (53:41 - 53:45)
like the amount of like i this game is (53:43 - 53:47)
incredible very good recommend sixty (53:45 - 53:50)
dollars i love it i i'm still playing it (53:47 - 53:51)
i will probably be playing it until (53:50 - 53:52)
whenever the next pokemon game comes out (53:51 - 53:54)
you know maybe i'll go back to sword and (53:52 - 53:55)
shield for a little bit especially for (53:54 - 53:57)
competitive but oh dang it i have to (53:55 - 53:59)
sign up for that thing but (53:57 - 54:01)
like i can see myself playing this game (53:59 - 54:03)
for the rest of the year because i do (54:01 - 54:04)
and this is what we haven't talked about (54:03 - 54:06)
yet i do think there's a way more than i (54:04 - 54:08)
thought in post game to do and that's (54:06 - 54:09)
great (54:08 - 54:12)
but this game is missing double battles (54:09 - 54:14)
uh the whole battle system i think is is (54:12 - 54:16)
just bad in general um this game is (54:14 - 54:19)
missing any sort of multiplayer which i (54:16 - 54:22)
think is a really strong pillar in the (54:19 - 54:25)
series and just to like the amount of (54:22 - 54:27)
fun people had with dynamaxx adventure (54:25 - 54:30)
and max raid battles and not having this (54:27 - 54:33)
in every pokemon game going forward is a (54:30 - 54:35)
huge disservice i want to play with (54:33 - 54:36)
three other people they figured it out (54:35 - 54:38)
in sword and shield they made it fun (54:36 - 54:40)
they figured it out twice in sword and (54:38 - 54:42)
shield they did max raid battles and (54:40 - 54:44)
then they did dynamax adventure and (54:42 - 54:45)
while they're slightly similar they're (54:44 - 54:47)
still different experiences and they're (54:45 - 54:49)
both fun in their own way like it is fun (54:47 - 54:51)
to go through dynamics adventure (54:49 - 54:53)
deciding which team you want to build (54:51 - 54:55)
and it is fun doing max raid battles (54:53 - 54:57)
with your favorite pokemon like they (54:55 - 55:00)
figured it out and like i feel like just (54:57 - 55:02)
as in just like the decks in this game (55:00 - 55:03)
is important going forward for other (55:02 - 55:06)
games i think a multi-player experience (55:03 - 55:07)
like sword and shield offered is just as (55:06 - 55:09)
important going through in in other (55:07 - 55:11)
games um (55:09 - 55:14)
if if (55:11 - 55:16)
big if and i'm not saying they should (55:14 - 55:18)
and i'm not saying (55:16 - 55:19)
this will happen (55:18 - 55:22)
but if they were to do a dlc for this (55:19 - 55:23)
game (55:22 - 55:26)
i would like them to add a multiplayer (55:23 - 55:28)
area that has like a dynamic adventure (55:26 - 55:33)
or or some sort of multiplayer (55:28 - 55:33)
anything like (55:33 - 55:38)
we we've established that we that we can (55:35 - 55:41)
cross the dimensions through our arc (55:38 - 55:41)
phone (55:41 - 55:44)
like i i would like to see (55:41 - 55:46)
if there's going to be a dlc that that (55:44 - 55:51)
dlc has a multiplayer (55:46 - 55:51)
part to it where i can connect with (55:51 - 55:56)
people so to respond to everything that (55:54 - 55:57)
steve just said because he just went (55:56 - 55:59)
like talking straight for 10 minutes (55:57 - 56:01)
without break (55:59 - 56:03)
number one (56:01 - 56:05)
this is probably the first time i've (56:03 - 56:08)
ever played a pokemon game where (56:05 - 56:10)
realizing that my pokemon were under (56:08 - 56:12)
leveled because i rushed through the (56:10 - 56:15)
story and i couldn't get past uh bravery (56:12 - 56:16)
girl (56:15 - 56:18)
i went (56:16 - 56:19)
and (56:18 - 56:21)
went into my pasture (56:19 - 56:24)
and i was like oh i have actually caught (56:21 - 56:27)
alpha pokemon that are at the same level (56:24 - 56:29)
as hers i'm just gonna swap them into my (56:27 - 56:34)
team and use these higher level pokemon (56:29 - 56:34)
the main selling point when people ask (56:34 - 56:38)
me whether they should get this game or (56:36 - 56:40)
not that i tell people (56:38 - 56:42)
is pokedex completion (56:40 - 56:44)
makes you feel like you're actually (56:42 - 56:47)
doing research yeah because (56:44 - 56:49)
if you're you're looking at the pokedex (56:47 - 56:52)
it's asking you to examine specific (56:49 - 56:54)
activities of the pokemon and you're (56:52 - 56:55)
going out and doing that to complete and (56:54 - 56:58)
i was like this is a huge (56:55 - 57:00)
like this is a huge draw (56:58 - 57:02)
of the game like it's it's not just (57:00 - 57:04)
catch and you're done it's it's more (57:02 - 57:07)
realistic to actually doing research in (57:04 - 57:08)
that way (57:07 - 57:09)
um (57:08 - 57:13)
as far as the multiplayer i think that (57:09 - 57:16)
if they had included the complexity of (57:13 - 57:19)
some sort of multiplayer on the level of (57:16 - 57:20)
anything where we would have found it a (57:19 - 57:23)
reasonable and enjoyable experience (57:20 - 57:24)
it would have made the game too (57:23 - 57:26)
complicated they're introducing a lot of (57:24 - 57:29)
new things in the way that this game is (57:26 - 57:30)
played (57:29 - 57:35)
and you know when arceus 2 comes out yes (57:30 - 57:37)
then fine put it because now we were (57:35 - 57:39)
used to this type of pokedex completion (57:37 - 57:41)
reduced you used to this kind of how you (57:39 - 57:43)
you capture the pokemon and everything (57:41 - 57:44)
like that (57:43 - 57:46)
and and and make the changes but this is (57:44 - 57:50)
like such a radical shift if they had (57:46 - 57:52)
done a ton of changes people would have (57:50 - 57:54)
been turned off i i can agree with that (57:52 - 57:57)
i i have a i have this a side question (57:54 - 57:59)
about alpha pokemon (57:57 - 58:00)
because i've been seeing this on the (57:59 - 58:03)
internet that the weasel (58:00 - 58:05)
oh get a larger boost it doesn't have to (58:03 - 58:09)
be hi hi mine is broken i have caught 40 (58:05 - 58:12)
weasel i am not kidding you 40 weasel (58:09 - 58:15)
none of them have been big enough (58:12 - 58:17)
it needs to be two eight it does the (58:15 - 58:19)
biggest one i've gotten was two seven (58:17 - 58:21)
wow (58:19 - 58:22)
because i keep people i keep seeing (58:21 - 58:24)
memes like oh (58:22 - 58:26)
this is the worst i'm like but it (58:24 - 58:27)
doesn't have to be an alpha it just has (58:26 - 58:29)
to be (58:27 - 58:30)
large doesn't have to be two ways i (58:29 - 58:33)
caught an alpha float sole (58:30 - 58:35)
guess what it doesn't count it's not a (58:33 - 58:36)
weasel i i i don't think you can get (58:35 - 58:39)
alpha weasel on the first area i think (58:36 - 58:42)
you can only get him on the third area (58:39 - 58:44)
and he spawns (58:42 - 58:46)
yeah he he's not like a static spawn (58:44 - 58:47)
like the floating in the breeze of (58:46 - 58:50)
pokedex it's catch large versions of (58:47 - 58:52)
these so once you get a large version (58:50 - 58:55)
and it's oh guess what two foot seven (58:52 - 58:57)
counts as a large version how deceiving (58:55 - 58:59)
you need two eighths you need two eight (58:57 - 59:01)
you need two what i gave is two nine but (58:59 - 59:03)
i was very confused by the things (59:01 - 59:05)
because i'm like but it doesn't have to (59:03 - 59:07)
be alpha it just has to be (59:05 - 59:09)
i mean it'd be cool looking because it (59:07 - 59:11)
will stand there being alpha i if you (59:09 - 59:14)
want that that's cool but i didn't i was (59:11 - 59:14)
like (59:14 - 59:16)
i keep alphas (59:14 - 59:20)
for me i am consolidating my power thank (59:16 - 59:21)
you very much (59:20 - 59:23)
you know the game's also missing you (59:21 - 59:25)
know it's missing like ribbons and marks (59:23 - 59:27)
i think i think marx (59:25 - 59:29)
no one cares about ribbons that's true i (59:27 - 59:30)
care about ribbons i think marx was a (59:29 - 59:33)
great another great way that sword and (59:30 - 59:35)
shield gave you a reason to never seen (59:33 - 59:37)
it in my life (59:35 - 59:39)
um the game is missing breeding (59:37 - 59:41)
the game i am sad that it's missing (59:39 - 59:42)
breeding breeding is one of my favorite (59:41 - 59:44)
things and i really wish it was in this (59:42 - 59:46)
game um even though like you know a (59:44 - 59:48)
month ago i complained that breeding (59:46 - 59:51)
needs to be refreshed and different and (59:48 - 59:52)
and this is this is the kind of the (59:51 - 59:54)
thing i'm talking about is is i don't (59:52 - 59:56)
think (59:54 - 59:56)
i don't think most people are creative (59:57 - 60:01)
enough to think of like (59:59 - 60:02)
that's why like game developers exist (60:01 - 60:04)
and why they're so clever like no like (60:02 - 60:06)
no one i would have ever talked to on (60:04 - 60:09)
like twitter or in our slack sorry slack (60:06 - 60:11)
or in our discord or on twitch chat (60:09 - 60:12)
would have been smart enough to think of (60:11 - 60:14)
like sos (60:12 - 60:17)
like sos was like a very like clever (60:14 - 60:19)
system yeah i i think you're (60:17 - 60:21)
underselling people i think (60:19 - 60:24)
generally when the question is asked (60:21 - 60:26)
people are like i have two minutes to (60:24 - 60:28)
come with a whole solution no (60:26 - 60:30)
like or or their default is i want (60:28 - 60:31)
something old to come back it's never (60:30 - 60:35)
like i want something new but and (60:31 - 60:37)
within like these people also didn't (60:35 - 60:39)
have a day to come up with something (60:37 - 60:40)
they had (60:39 - 60:42)
a development cycle to come up with (60:40 - 60:43)
something new (60:42 - 60:45)
like give me a development cycle and (60:43 - 60:47)
absolutely i can come up with something (60:45 - 60:49)
i mean for example i'm trying to write a (60:47 - 60:51)
new rpg (60:49 - 60:53)
and i'm like i'm stuck on this part if (60:51 - 60:55)
you asked me for lucian four days ago i (60:53 - 60:57)
couldn't give it to you i'm four days (60:55 - 60:58)
later i've figured out the solution that (60:57 - 61:00)
i'm happy with yeah those things take (60:58 - 61:02)
time (61:00 - 61:05)
yeah i mean i and you know if i would i (61:02 - 61:07)
would expect (61:05 - 61:09)
breeding to come back for a gen 9 you (61:07 - 61:11)
know i would expect eight gyms to come (61:09 - 61:13)
back for a gen nine i would expect the (61:11 - 61:15)
same battle system hopefully with some (61:13 - 61:16)
of the cha i think some of the changes (61:15 - 61:18)
in the battle system are good and this (61:16 - 61:19)
is what we didn't talk about i think i (61:18 - 61:21)
think changing sleep to drowsy (61:19 - 61:24)
was good i think changing frozen to (61:21 - 61:26)
frostbite is good and in a competitive (61:24 - 61:28)
sense the reason i think those are good (61:26 - 61:30)
is because ultimately there was not a (61:28 - 61:31)
difference between being frozen and (61:30 - 61:33)
being put to sleep you were still losing (61:31 - 61:35)
your turns between one to five turns (61:33 - 61:37)
until you randomly woke up from that (61:35 - 61:40)
status condition now there were moves (61:37 - 61:44)
like um scald or or flamethrower that (61:40 - 61:46)
would get rid of frozen early granted if (61:44 - 61:48)
you had those moves same with sleep if (61:46 - 61:50)
you were asleep you could use like sleep (61:48 - 61:52)
talk or you could use uproar to get rid (61:50 - 61:53)
of those moves but ultimately they were (61:52 - 61:55)
the same thing (61:53 - 61:56)
and then (61:55 - 61:59)
so when they change frozen to frostbite (61:56 - 62:00)
um (61:59 - 62:02)
your special attack is now reduced which (62:00 - 62:04)
is great because if you are burned your (62:02 - 62:06)
physical attack is now reduced so now (62:04 - 62:08)
there's an alternate to that when you're (62:06 - 62:10)
paralyzed now so some people might say (62:08 - 62:12)
well paralyze and sleep are not the same (62:10 - 62:14)
because you there's a chance that you (62:12 - 62:16)
might not be able to act um paralyzed (62:14 - 62:19)
not only reduces your speed (62:16 - 62:20)
and then prevents you from it reduces (62:19 - 62:22)
your speed by 50 i actually don't know (62:20 - 62:24)
if that's the same in in legends but in (62:22 - 62:26)
like sword shield it reduces your speed (62:24 - 62:29)
by 50 it it does reduce your speed i (62:26 - 62:30)
don't know if it's the 50 but it does (62:29 - 62:34)
affect the turn order in in legends if (62:30 - 62:35)
you're drowsy (62:34 - 62:38)
you might not be able to move but um i (62:35 - 62:40)
believe you take more damage when you (62:38 - 62:42)
take more damage so (62:40 - 62:46)
they i'm i think that is important going (62:42 - 62:48)
forward for competitive stuff and i i do (62:46 - 62:50)
strongly believe that like there's no (62:48 - 62:51)
way they get rid of the current (62:50 - 62:53)
competitive format (62:51 - 62:55)
obviously they've made changes to the (62:53 - 62:56)
competitive format they've they made a (62:55 - 62:58)
change to tailwind in sword and shield (62:56 - 63:00)
that was really drastic you know they've (62:58 - 63:02)
changed abilities before they've changed (63:00 - 63:04)
however (63:02 - 63:05)
yeah (63:04 - 63:08)
what was uh what was talonflames (63:05 - 63:10)
gale wings they changed yeah they (63:08 - 63:12)
changed gale wings (63:10 - 63:13)
uh (63:12 - 63:17)
so there are (63:13 - 63:18)
there are they you know they introduce (63:17 - 63:21)
pokemon like reggie elike (63:18 - 63:23)
just like completely destroy the format (63:21 - 63:26)
urshifu exists because protect anyways (63:23 - 63:27)
i i (63:26 - 63:30)
i am frustrated with the just the the (63:27 - 63:32)
concept of trying to simplify this (63:30 - 63:35)
battle system and i think they failed on (63:32 - 63:36)
two parts and this i do want to talk (63:35 - 63:38)
about this because i i don't think it (63:36 - 63:40)
was talked about (63:38 - 63:42)
well enough last week (63:40 - 63:43)
so there there's there's two parts of (63:42 - 63:44)
the battle system i think they failed on (63:43 - 63:46)
both parts i think they failed in the (63:44 - 63:47)
single player part of the battle system (63:46 - 63:48)
and i think they failed on the (63:47 - 63:50)
competitive part of the battle system (63:48 - 63:52)
and i get it this game was not meant to (63:50 - 63:55)
be competitive but (63:52 - 63:57)
um (63:55 - 63:57)
but i think in a competitive sense just (63:58 - 64:03)
changing how moves work (64:00 - 64:03)
current moves work just seemed so (64:04 - 64:08)
backwards (64:07 - 64:09)
like (64:08 - 64:10)
if i (64:09 - 64:14)
have been using aqua jet for 20 years (64:10 - 64:15)
and now aqua jets does something (64:14 - 64:17)
different (64:15 - 64:19)
why because i know (64:17 - 64:22)
they change moves all the time (64:19 - 64:25)
but it it's part in the turn order (64:22 - 64:28)
but even a move like self-destruct (64:25 - 64:30)
you know it doesn't like it it doesn't (64:28 - 64:31)
knock you out anymore right (64:30 - 64:33)
self-destruct only does 80 percent so (64:31 - 64:35)
you survive to self-destruct they change (64:33 - 64:37)
moves all the time (64:35 - 64:39)
but they also introduce new moves all (64:37 - 64:42)
the time if they want it if they wanted (64:39 - 64:44)
if they if they're going to change moves (64:42 - 64:46)
to fundamentally do something different (64:44 - 64:47)
like stealth rock stealth rock is (64:46 - 64:51)
remotely the same as what it is (64:47 - 64:52)
but (64:51 - 64:56)
in gen 9 or whatever jen is coming next (64:52 - 64:58)
is stealth rock not going to do what it (64:56 - 65:00)
did in general well the question is (64:58 - 65:02)
is gen 9 a (65:00 - 65:04)
traditional (65:02 - 65:06)
like we're used to old style pokemon (65:04 - 65:08)
game or is it a legends archaea style (65:06 - 65:09)
game (65:08 - 65:11)
in a competitive sense there's no way (65:09 - 65:13)
they're going to get away (65:11 - 65:15)
from how successful sword and shield was (65:13 - 65:18)
competitively (65:15 - 65:22)
like i cannot imagine (65:18 - 65:22)
and if you look at this game they got (65:22 - 65:25)
they got rid of moves that hit two (65:24 - 65:28)
pokemon which still is (65:25 - 65:30)
very dumbfounding to me uh they changed (65:28 - 65:32)
the whole turn order they purposely (65:30 - 65:33)
didn't put a competitive thing in (65:32 - 65:35)
because because the actual battle system (65:33 - 65:37)
in this game is broken like you can (65:35 - 65:40)
abuse it in your in in your favor (65:37 - 65:44)
and there there is like no multiplayer (65:40 - 65:46)
so this is the to me this is like this (65:44 - 65:48)
is a one-off battle system that we're (65:46 - 65:50)
just trying we're going to go back to (65:48 - 65:52)
normal things in the future uh no i (65:50 - 65:54)
wouldn't and going back to normal things (65:52 - 65:55)
future is like (65:54 - 65:57)
it's going to work the way it's going to (65:55 - 65:58)
self-destruct going to work the way it's (65:57 - 66:00)
going to giga impact is going to think (65:58 - 66:03)
of it differently think of it as (66:00 - 66:05)
you have traditional monster hunter (66:03 - 66:07)
games and you have monster hunter (66:05 - 66:09)
stories they're both monster hunter (66:07 - 66:11)
games but the battle systems in both are (66:09 - 66:13)
completely different and they live in (66:11 - 66:14)
their own worlds (66:13 - 66:15)
we will have (66:14 - 66:18)
for for competitive you'll have (66:15 - 66:21)
traditional pokemon game for this other (66:18 - 66:23)
style of game the art legends archaea (66:21 - 66:25)
style game you'll have this type of they (66:23 - 66:27)
they don't but (66:25 - 66:29)
that's assuming that there's going to be (66:27 - 66:31)
more legends arceus just like that's (66:29 - 66:33)
people assuming that there's going to be (66:31 - 66:34)
more let's go right everyone thought (66:33 - 66:36)
that there was going to be like a let's (66:34 - 66:37)
go diamond let's go pearl you know what (66:36 - 66:39)
we got we got a (66:37 - 66:40)
the traditional (66:39 - 66:43)
faithful diamond and pearl right so it's (66:40 - 66:45)
a one shot you close the book you say (66:43 - 66:46)
they tried this (66:45 - 66:48)
type of battle system and it was for (66:46 - 66:51)
that one game and it's done i i mean i (66:48 - 66:53)
think (66:51 - 66:53)
the changes they made sense given (66:53 - 66:59)
like the world they created right like (66:56 - 67:02)
it is a reflection of what (66:59 - 67:04)
you expect and (67:02 - 67:07)
i i i can see it both from a story-wise (67:04 - 67:09)
it makes sense that they changed them (67:07 - 67:12)
from a developer-wise like hey let's (67:09 - 67:14)
throw out some ideas about how these (67:12 - 67:16)
things could work and we can do it in (67:14 - 67:18)
this game because we're changing a lot (67:16 - 67:22)
and we're doing an active time system so (67:18 - 67:25)
if we go towards a more (67:22 - 67:29)
active turn order system (67:25 - 67:29)
in future installments of the regular (67:29 - 67:34)
series how can we (67:32 - 67:37)
it work with these things especially if (67:34 - 67:39)
swapping out doesn't become a thing (67:37 - 67:41)
doom because i think (67:39 - 67:43)
in double battles like stealth rock (67:41 - 67:45)
doesn't see correct me if i'm wrong but (67:43 - 67:47)
stealth rock doesn't see a ton of views (67:45 - 67:50)
because double battles singles yeah yeah (67:47 - 67:52)
so like when you look at it that way you (67:50 - 67:54)
think okay well stealth rock works is a (67:52 - 67:57)
very different way now it fits (67:54 - 67:59)
in a competitive aspect where stealth (67:57 - 68:02)
rock has fallen out of favor (67:59 - 68:04)
and this is the game where the world (68:02 - 68:06)
doesn't work the way you expect it to (68:04 - 68:08)
for those ideas to come (68:06 - 68:10)
into play (68:08 - 68:12)
whether or not they accept them and move (68:10 - 68:14)
them forward is a decision that they'll (68:12 - 68:16)
have to make like i think we can agree (68:14 - 68:18)
that (68:16 - 68:20)
frostbite is better i'm iffy about (68:18 - 68:21)
drowsy (68:20 - 68:25)
um i think drowsy is better than sleep (68:21 - 68:26)
yeah (68:25 - 68:27)
i (68:26 - 68:28)
i'm i'm (68:27 - 68:31)
i i i have not a strong feeling either (68:28 - 68:34)
way i i i (68:31 - 68:34)
they don't make it very clear that (68:34 - 68:39)
there's an extra added benefit to it um (68:36 - 68:40)
yeah (68:39 - 68:42)
i mean this company is very good at (68:40 - 68:45)
making things not clear right so i think (68:42 - 68:46)
like (68:45 - 68:50)
outside of a competitive (68:46 - 68:50)
situation drowsy doesn't feel any (68:51 - 68:56)
different than paralysis (68:54 - 68:57)
yes (68:56 - 69:00)
so in that way i think it fails because (68:57 - 69:01)
they don't really explain what's (69:00 - 69:02)
happening (69:01 - 69:05)
and outside of a competitive aspect (69:02 - 69:06)
where (69:05 - 69:09)
taking more damage (69:06 - 69:09)
matters than missing turns (69:09 - 69:14)
i i think it come it feels stronger (69:12 - 69:17)
there whereas here i'm like okay but i (69:14 - 69:18)
didn't (69:17 - 69:20)
miss my turn and i still blasted them (69:18 - 69:22)
away because i have type advantage (69:20 - 69:24)
because no i type advantage work so (69:22 - 69:26)
ultimately drowsy did nothing because i (69:24 - 69:28)
got to move right away (69:26 - 69:30)
and i never took damage so i never saw (69:28 - 69:32)
me taking more damage yeah i want to (69:30 - 69:34)
follow on what greg said just before we (69:32 - 69:36)
get too far away from it (69:34 - 69:39)
but one of the key things which (69:36 - 69:42)
if you think about it just a little bit (69:39 - 69:46)
we are clearly in a different universe (69:42 - 69:47)
yeah yes (69:46 - 69:49)
why would you expect the rules of (69:47 - 69:52)
pokemon battle to be exactly the same as (69:49 - 69:54)
every other universe when you're clearly (69:52 - 69:58)
in a dif no it's about story it's not (69:54 - 70:00)
about spreadsheet wars it's about power (69:58 - 70:03)
it's about drive and no going second (70:00 - 70:04)
along with that (70:03 - 70:07)
thank you this battle system (70:04 - 70:10)
at which i i will hold on to my last (70:07 - 70:12)
breath about so much of the decisions (70:10 - 70:15)
for this game this battle system is (70:12 - 70:18)
designed to make you feel like you are (70:15 - 70:21)
in a field with pokemon who are in your (70:18 - 70:23)
face battling you're not standing on a (70:21 - 70:26)
platform over there (70:23 - 70:28)
waiting patiently for (70:26 - 70:31)
decisions to be made and the the the (70:28 - 70:34)
choice to be plugged in you are made to (70:31 - 70:38)
feel like you are there with the battle (70:34 - 70:39)
and that's that's what this battle (70:38 - 70:41)
system is designed as (70:39 - 70:43)
it's bad though (70:41 - 70:46)
because you want spreadsheet wars and (70:43 - 70:48)
this game is spreadsheet you absolutely (70:46 - 70:49)
watch (70:48 - 70:50)
this (70:49 - 70:52)
this game used to give me five stages (70:50 - 70:55)
priority when i and now this move (70:52 - 70:57)
doesn't give me five stages priority (70:55 - 70:59)
yeah i i think i think he even thinks (70:57 - 71:02)
about that when you're in the heat of (70:59 - 71:02)
the (71:02 - 71:05)
grass and the volcano and there's the (71:02 - 71:07)
arcanine standing there there and a (71:05 - 71:09)
zubat just came over because he just (71:07 - 71:10)
he's a (71:09 - 71:14)
nosy busybody it is confusing to me that (71:10 - 71:17)
if if they want moves to act differently (71:14 - 71:19)
then just make a new move they made new (71:17 - 71:22)
moves sideshield bash is a new move it (71:19 - 71:24)
could have been you know with weird (71:22 - 71:26)
you're getting 20 energies too much (71:24 - 71:27)
complexity and people are going to get (71:26 - 71:30)
turned off people know this move name is (71:27 - 71:34)
a water type move and i i've heard you (71:30 - 71:37)
say it which like blew my mind (71:34 - 71:39)
i know what this move is called i'm not (71:37 - 71:41)
going to read what it does you're a fool (71:39 - 71:44)
you're a fool you are a fool they (71:41 - 71:48)
constantly change the moves take a (71:44 - 71:50)
second to read the three sentences that (71:48 - 71:53)
describe what the move does especially (71:50 - 71:55)
if the first time you do it it doesn't (71:53 - 71:58)
work self-destruct has always knocked (71:55 - 71:59)
you out the fact that self-destruct (71:58 - 72:03)
brings you to like 20 hp (71:59 - 72:05)
and then probably in gen 9 self-destruct (72:03 - 72:07)
is going to go back to knocking you out (72:05 - 72:09)
why not make who knows why not make a (72:07 - 72:11)
new move why not call it like because (72:09 - 72:13)
there's something semi destroyed space (72:11 - 72:15)
out there people know that this is a (72:13 - 72:18)
move that's going to seriously damage me (72:15 - 72:20)
and do serious damage to my opponent (72:18 - 72:23)
removed (72:20 - 72:26)
20 they removed 94 moves from sword and (72:23 - 72:27)
shield i mean what are all these people (72:26 - 72:29)
going to do when we get to gen 9 and (72:27 - 72:32)
there's not 850 pokemon available to (72:29 - 72:34)
them and they have to figure out which (72:32 - 72:36)
ones are there and which ones are i i (72:34 - 72:38)
actually don't know how many moves they (72:36 - 72:41)
added to legends i know for sure one (72:38 - 72:44)
shield i know headstrong whatever claw (72:41 - 72:47)
from ursulina like that's a new move uh (72:44 - 72:50)
there's a new one for typhlosion which i (72:47 - 72:53)
use infernal purge i think yeah no (72:50 - 72:54)
parade (72:53 - 72:56)
grade that's yeah so they're they're (72:54 - 72:59)
adding new moves i think (72:56 - 73:00)
yeah (72:59 - 73:02)
if they're changing like okay this move (73:00 - 73:05)
now does 120 damage versus 100 damage (73:02 - 73:06)
like yeah sure that makes sense but like (73:05 - 73:08)
just straight up changing a move like (73:06 - 73:10)
self-destruct just or stealth rock just (73:08 - 73:11)
seems like just call it something (73:10 - 73:13)
different i mean what else do we not (73:11 - 73:15)
have in this game we don't have move (73:13 - 73:18)
tutors we don't have tms we do (73:15 - 73:20)
technically have hms because (73:18 - 73:23)
kind of has a message (73:20 - 73:24)
i would say we kind of have move tutors (73:23 - 73:26)
because you have to like pay for those (73:24 - 73:28)
moves to like permanently unlock them i (73:26 - 73:31)
thought zizu just made you gave you (73:28 - 73:33)
massive no (73:31 - 73:33)
one of the pokedex entry for my alakazam (73:44 - 73:46)
was (73:46 - 73:49)
used psychic and it doesn't have it so i (73:46 - 73:52)
had to go to zoo and say hey (73:49 - 73:55)
i need psychic and z is like uh (73:52 - 73:58)
that'll be three thousand dollars like (73:55 - 74:00)
excuse me (73:58 - 74:02)
so so so the (74:00 - 74:05)
the competitive sense of like (74:02 - 74:07)
they failed at that part which is like (74:05 - 74:09)
to be expected and to be fine right (74:07 - 74:12)
there is no verses in the game there's (74:09 - 74:13)
no abilities there's no held items and (74:12 - 74:14)
for the record i'm not mad about (74:13 - 74:16)
abilities and held items i think it's (74:14 - 74:17)
fine like (74:16 - 74:19)
that i i think for me the thing that was (74:17 - 74:22)
frustrating was just changing how moves (74:19 - 74:24)
fundamentally work (74:22 - 74:25)
and (74:24 - 74:27)
in a single player sense i think the (74:25 - 74:30)
battle system is bad because (74:27 - 74:32)
one it can be abused let me give you two (74:30 - 74:34)
situations where it can be abused (74:32 - 74:37)
a move that normally (74:34 - 74:38)
uh (74:37 - 74:40)
so so moves like hyper beam or giga (74:38 - 74:43)
impact you use it you wait a full turn (74:40 - 74:45)
and then you're you're out (74:43 - 74:47)
you can't attack (74:45 - 74:50)
and then you can do it again right (74:47 - 74:52)
and this was there was a really great (74:50 - 74:54)
strategy in omega ruby off of sapphire (74:52 - 74:56)
slash ruby and sapphire where norman (74:54 - 74:59)
would use hyper beam on his slacking (74:56 - 75:01)
and his and then because because of (74:59 - 75:04)
slacking's ability of slacking off he (75:01 - 75:05)
wouldn't be able to attack anyway (75:04 - 75:07)
because the ability would go into effect (75:05 - 75:09)
and then he would be able to attack the (75:07 - 75:10)
next turn with hyper beam really really (75:09 - 75:13)
great really very easy to counter right (75:10 - 75:14)
you just protect that turn attack him (75:13 - 75:18)
when he's slacking off protect again (75:14 - 75:19)
in this game (75:18 - 75:21)
you can just strong style hyper beam (75:19 - 75:24)
with no punishment because strong style (75:21 - 75:26)
is going to make you go to make you wait (75:24 - 75:27)
two turns (75:26 - 75:30)
and you just oh no no no that's not the (75:27 - 75:31)
real cheat do you want to know what the (75:30 - 75:33)
real cheat is (75:31 - 75:34)
that happened to me (75:33 - 75:39)
the wild pokemon agile style a move (75:34 - 75:41)
and then when they get their second (75:39 - 75:44)
chance they strong style that second one (75:41 - 75:45)
yeah that's (75:44 - 75:47)
mean yeah so this is how busted the (75:45 - 75:50)
system is when i was fighting commanders (75:47 - 75:51)
snorlax (75:50 - 75:55)
he strong styled hyper beamed me (75:51 - 75:57)
and missed (75:55 - 76:00)
and then i aqua jetted which gives you (75:57 - 76:02)
priority or not priority but gives you (76:00 - 76:04)
priority the next turn (76:02 - 76:07)
and i agile styled aquajet so you know (76:04 - 76:09)
how it shows the move order where it's (76:07 - 76:11)
like weasel weasel weasel also i beat (76:09 - 76:13)
the game with like a weasel and a glamio (76:11 - 76:15)
weasel weasel weasel (76:13 - 76:16)
so (76:15 - 76:18)
i was able to it said three it said (76:16 - 76:20)
weasel wheeze of weasel so i agiled aqua (76:18 - 76:22)
jet (76:20 - 76:24)
and then it said it again weasel weasel (76:22 - 76:27)
weasel and then i aqua styled (76:24 - 76:30)
i i agile aquajet again (76:27 - 76:32)
and his snorlax never came up (76:30 - 76:34)
it was just weasels for the because (76:32 - 76:36)
because i was locked into the the (76:34 - 76:40)
priority loop but agile uses up more pp (76:36 - 76:42)
so eventually you're going to run out (76:40 - 76:44)
faster than if you were just regular (76:42 - 76:46)
doing aquajet (76:44 - 76:48)
but it sets you up in a position where (76:46 - 76:50)
like what the person did to you you keep (76:48 - 76:52)
agile styling until it's in range and (76:50 - 76:53)
then last minute you switched a strong (76:52 - 76:55)
style it wasn't there or you literally a (76:53 - 76:56)
pokemon (76:55 - 76:58)
yeah or i mean that (76:56 - 77:00)
that is what the game is supposed that (76:58 - 77:02)
is what this is supposed to do right i (77:00 - 77:04)
mean there was a software update this (77:02 - 77:06)
morning maybe they fixed this (77:04 - 77:08)
there is no there's in no sense that (77:06 - 77:11)
that would be fun (77:08 - 77:12)
for (77:11 - 77:14)
for uh if you were on the receiving end (77:12 - 77:17)
that would not be fun oh no i i don't i (77:14 - 77:19)
don't eight turns in a row i don't think (77:17 - 77:21)
agile strong style is moving out of this (77:19 - 77:23)
game no yeah (77:21 - 77:26)
it's yeah (77:23 - 77:26)
again it's solely a npc battle wild (77:27 - 77:31)
battle (77:30 - 77:33)
but yeah but i think they do that poorly (77:31 - 77:34)
i mean and when i talk to people that (77:33 - 77:36)
like the battle system i'm like what (77:34 - 77:37)
what do you like about it and they're (77:36 - 77:39)
like it's faster and it's like yeah (77:37 - 77:41)
you're right it is faster i was like (77:39 - 77:42)
have you ever played persona 5 have you (77:41 - 77:45)
ever played bravely default no (77:42 - 77:47)
those games do i like how you answer for (77:45 - 77:51)
them no they they said no (77:47 - 77:52)
like (77:51 - 77:54)
those games do (77:52 - 77:56)
a single player (77:54 - 77:57)
fast (77:56 - 77:59)
battle style significantly better than (77:57 - 78:01)
legends does so even if you're like i (77:59 - 78:03)
like that they changed it i like that (78:01 - 78:04)
it's not this sword and shield (78:03 - 78:06)
turn-based system (78:04 - 78:07)
i'm glad that you (78:06 - 78:10)
admitted or i gl maybe that you're tired (78:07 - 78:13)
of what traditional you know 2v2 (78:10 - 78:15)
competitive sword and shield or pass (78:13 - 78:16)
games are (78:15 - 78:20)
but the the battle system in this game (78:16 - 78:22)
is just a very (78:20 - 78:25)
knockoff budget version of what these (78:22 - 78:27)
other jrpgs are doing (78:25 - 78:32)
like in persona 5 you can attack (78:27 - 78:34)
five creatures at once and you can bring (78:32 - 78:36)
them down to one hp and you can like end (78:34 - 78:38)
those battles very quickly if you know (78:36 - 78:40)
what you're doing and if you don't know (78:38 - 78:42)
what you're doing those same battles can (78:40 - 78:44)
go drastically wrong and you're in a (78:42 - 78:46)
situation where you have to plan and (78:44 - 78:49)
think and strategize and there's really (78:46 - 78:50)
none of that (78:49 - 78:53)
in any of these battles like an alpha (78:50 - 78:55)
battle can go wrong but it goes wrong in (78:53 - 78:57)
the sense of like (78:55 - 78:59)
you missed all your moves and they got a (78:57 - 79:01)
lot of critical hits like it's not (78:59 - 79:04)
particularly interesting i do think the (79:01 - 79:05)
alpha battles are the stronger battles (79:04 - 79:10)
than versus just normal wild battles um (79:05 - 79:12)
but but again in like i said last week (79:10 - 79:14)
with with bravely default there's (79:12 - 79:16)
there's zero reward (79:14 - 79:17)
and (79:16 - 79:19)
there's only punishment (79:17 - 79:20)
for you (79:19 - 79:22)
getting in a situation where it's one (79:20 - 79:24)
verse four (79:22 - 79:26)
like there's no i mean (79:24 - 79:27)
there's there's no reason except for the (79:26 - 79:30)
joy of the battle the joy the thrill (79:27 - 79:32)
and again in x and y we had one verse (79:30 - 79:36)
five i could surf them i could i could (79:32 - 79:38)
earthquake them i could rock slide them (79:36 - 79:41)
i i the thing that i will say is (79:38 - 79:45)
for as late as they came to the action (79:41 - 79:47)
rpg system (79:45 - 79:50)
they seem to have steadfastly refused to (79:47 - 79:53)
look at anybody how anybody else did it (79:50 - 79:54)
well yeah (79:53 - 79:56)
there's trademark copyright yeah (79:54 - 79:58)
mechanics copyright sure you can't (79:56 - 80:02)
copyright mechanics um believe me i know (79:58 - 80:06)
you cannot copyright game mechanics um (80:02 - 80:09)
but i think (80:06 - 80:09)
i think what excites (80:12 - 80:16)
people (80:14 - 80:19)
myself included is we see them starting (80:16 - 80:22)
where a lot of other games also started (80:19 - 80:24)
from and (80:22 - 80:26)
perhaps naively are hoping that they (80:24 - 80:29)
will take a shorter development cycle to (80:26 - 80:31)
get where everybody else is we have no (80:29 - 80:33)
proof that that's going to happen (80:31 - 80:36)
but i think (80:33 - 80:38)
what myself and other people i probably (80:36 - 80:40)
are excited about is that it does feel (80:38 - 80:41)
like (80:40 - 80:43)
for the first time in 25 years you're (80:41 - 80:47)
open to change (80:43 - 80:47)
i also had a hard time with the battles (80:49 - 80:52)
i mean i (80:51 - 80:54)
would frequently get half my team (80:52 - 80:57)
knocked out before yeah (80:54 - 80:58)
but i don't think that's i don't think (80:57 - 81:00)
that's necessarily because the game is (80:58 - 81:01)
hard i think it's because the game is (81:00 - 81:03)
unfair like (81:01 - 81:05)
not unfair in the sense of like well i (81:03 - 81:07)
mean one person's heart is another (81:05 - 81:09)
person's unfair that's just a matter of (81:07 - 81:11)
perspective (81:09 - 81:13)
it's it's like you go like um the battle (81:11 - 81:16)
against benny (81:13 - 81:18)
he attacks twice right away there's (81:16 - 81:20)
nothing you can do about it yeah (81:18 - 81:23)
uh have a higher level pokemon (81:20 - 81:25)
no matter what no matter what he will go (81:23 - 81:26)
twice that's just the start of the (81:25 - 81:28)
battle (81:26 - 81:31)
and and they caught me unaware (81:28 - 81:34)
so so in a sense of like most of these (81:31 - 81:37)
battles they're artificially hard (81:34 - 81:39)
because they're ignoring your move (81:37 - 81:40)
you're they're ignoring your speed (81:39 - 81:42)
they're ignoring what pokemon you have (81:40 - 81:44)
out there ignoring everything for the (81:42 - 81:46)
opponent to just go first one to two (81:44 - 81:47)
times (81:46 - 81:49)
and that's where like the added (81:47 - 81:51)
difficulty comes in (81:49 - 81:53)
uh which is again (81:51 - 81:56)
if i i think my final thoughts on this (81:53 - 81:58)
is like (81:56 - 81:59)
the current (81:58 - 82:01)
battle system that exists in sword and (81:59 - 82:04)
shield is not it's not even like it's (82:01 - 82:06)
not broken don't fix it it's incredibly (82:04 - 82:09)
good it's really it's really in depth (82:06 - 82:11)
the moves offer a lot of variety the (82:09 - 82:14)
pokemon offer a ton of variety abilities (82:11 - 82:15)
like (82:14 - 82:17)
it is an inherent like it is one of the (82:15 - 82:20)
best jrpg battle systems out there (82:17 - 82:23)
and so to then remove that to try (82:20 - 82:25)
something new and when the something new (82:23 - 82:27)
isn't better than what other games are (82:25 - 82:28)
doing (82:27 - 82:30)
and it's like (82:28 - 82:33)
you you've built an incredible battle (82:30 - 82:35)
system over the years and you threw that (82:33 - 82:38)
all out out the window for something so (82:35 - 82:40)
mediocre like that is the frustrating (82:38 - 82:42)
part like (82:40 - 82:44)
you couldn't even copy somebody else's (82:42 - 82:46)
homework well enough (82:44 - 82:49)
to like other games are doing this and i (82:46 - 82:51)
encourage pokemon fans to play other (82:49 - 82:53)
jrpgs like (82:51 - 82:56)
like if if you sky if you like this (82:53 - 82:59)
battle system in legends please go buy (82:56 - 83:01)
bravely default too but you know you (82:59 - 83:02)
know what's hilarious in love with that (83:01 - 83:04)
battle system (83:02 - 83:07)
i tried bravely default and hated it and (83:04 - 83:10)
i actually like this battle system so (83:07 - 83:11)
it's (83:10 - 83:14)
you know i tried i tried bravely default (83:11 - 83:16)
hated it (83:14 - 83:18)
try persona 5 royal (83:16 - 83:20)
i ain't doing another persona game those (83:18 - 83:23)
games it might be two anime for you (83:20 - 83:23)
my only problem with other jp rpgs is (83:25 - 83:30)
they take way too long to get into but (83:27 - 83:33)
they they're way too complicated they (83:30 - 83:35)
got a lot of persona you got the tarot (83:33 - 83:37)
cards you got the yeah you gotta go to (83:35 - 83:39)
the dungeon you gotta talk to the guy in (83:37 - 83:41)
there you're in jail for five hours (83:39 - 83:42)
somebody (83:41 - 83:47)
there's a cat that talks to ya (83:42 - 83:47)
and i'm not going to anymore (83:50 - 83:55)
any other closing thoughts (83:53 - 83:57)
um (83:55 - 83:57)
uh brilliant game (83:58 - 84:02)
wonderful storyline (84:00 - 84:03)
uh (84:02 - 84:05)
way better than i thought (84:03 - 84:08)
uh mass outbreaks are (84:05 - 84:10)
the bane of my existence because they (84:08 - 84:12)
won't give me what i want (84:10 - 84:15)
um i i would say this if you (84:12 - 84:17)
like if you are a pokemon fan that has (84:15 - 84:19)
been burned out on the same old same (84:17 - 84:22)
mold and you really want to (84:19 - 84:25)
signal the pokemon company that you like (84:22 - 84:27)
this particular direction then you (84:25 - 84:29)
should go out and buy this game (84:27 - 84:31)
like i think everybody who's a pokemon (84:29 - 84:32)
fan (84:31 - 84:34)
will find something to enjoy in this (84:32 - 84:38)
game and the best way to let them know (84:34 - 84:39)
that (84:38 - 84:41)
that this is a this is a direction that (84:39 - 84:43)
you enjoy that there's a lot in this (84:41 - 84:45)
game that you enjoy is to go buy it (84:43 - 84:47)
and i would say (84:45 - 84:49)
along those lines (84:47 - 84:51)
get this game definitely (84:49 - 84:52)
and (84:51 - 84:54)
do your best (84:52 - 84:56)
to not overthink (84:54 - 84:58)
just immerse yourself use your (84:56 - 85:00)
imagination (84:58 - 85:03)
imagine like the story and the world (85:00 - 85:04)
don't (85:03 - 85:07)
don't overthink about the mechanics (85:04 - 85:09)
and just have a good time (85:07 - 85:11)
i think that's a very good joy in this (85:09 - 85:13)
game and and (85:11 - 85:16)
actually i think i i would say when you (85:13 - 85:18)
see the map of jesus think of what (85:16 - 85:19)
modern or (85:18 - 85:22)
the the other sinnoh you've been to (85:19 - 85:24)
looks like what things are in those (85:22 - 85:25)
places (85:24 - 85:27)
as you go through them and how they (85:25 - 85:30)
compare (85:27 - 85:30)
i have so many theories i'm gonna go on (85:31 - 85:36)
game theory channel and present (85:33 - 85:38)
my wacky theories (85:36 - 85:40)
yeah i think this i think this game is (85:38 - 85:43)
really great um i would like to see dlc (85:40 - 85:44)
for it i think it's rumored that it's (85:43 - 85:46)
dlc just based on packaging in other (85:44 - 85:48)
countries they have to like (85:46 - 85:50)
they're required by putting something on (85:48 - 85:53)
the box where the us isn't specifically (85:50 - 85:55)
um if the game doesn't get dlc i don't (85:53 - 85:58)
think i'm gonna be hurt like i think i (85:55 - 86:00)
think it's a complete package (85:58 - 86:02)
which i would actually maybe not say so (86:00 - 86:04)
much about sword and shield i think (86:02 - 86:06)
sword and shield really is stellar (86:04 - 86:09)
because of the dlc uh (86:06 - 86:12)
i disagree i think i think sword and (86:09 - 86:16)
shield was greatly enhanced by the dlc (86:12 - 86:19)
but i think the main game was a complete (86:16 - 86:21)
playthrough yeah (86:19 - 86:23)
i would say olive armor for most people (86:21 - 86:24)
was (86:23 - 86:27)
flat and crowned tundra (86:24 - 86:28)
or what i'm thinking the other way (86:27 - 86:30)
around i think isle of armor was better (86:28 - 86:32)
and crown tundra was [ __ ] one of the (86:30 - 86:34)
two ways i mean i finished crown tundra (86:32 - 86:37)
so (86:34 - 86:37)
is like ultrasound ultimate (86:39 - 86:43)
right i think for replacing a third (86:41 - 86:47)
version the dlcs were a great way to (86:43 - 86:49)
extend the life of those games yeah yeah (86:47 - 86:52)
i do think short sword and shield as a (86:49 - 86:55)
without a dsc was a it was a very solid (86:52 - 86:57)
game yes (86:55 - 87:00)
like i thought i i think sun and moon is (86:57 - 87:03)
a solid game until ultra existed and (87:00 - 87:04)
then i was like there's no reason to buy (87:03 - 87:06)
sun and moon well the story in sunday (87:04 - 87:08)
moon is better yes yeah (87:06 - 87:11)
by by leaps and bounds (87:08 - 87:13)
but the amount of content and fixes in (87:11 - 87:15)
ultra sun and moon make it yeah i mean (87:13 - 87:17)
life improvement pokemon stuff and ultra (87:15 - 87:19)
sun (87:17 - 87:20)
that game would be brilliant if they had (87:19 - 87:22)
not shied away from the better story (87:20 - 87:24)
they did in sun and moon yeah it just (87:22 - 87:25)
didn't make any sense that they were (87:24 - 87:28)
like let's cut this lily part like that (87:25 - 87:30)
was the best part of your story (87:28 - 87:32)
you literally cut the best part of your (87:30 - 87:33)
story (87:32 - 87:35)
the theme that they told the theme that (87:33 - 87:38)
they told in both legends arceus and sun (87:35 - 87:40)
and moon (87:38 - 87:42)
really show the power that these games (87:40 - 87:44)
can do for storytelling and i really (87:42 - 87:48)
want them to lean into it more (87:44 - 87:50)
all right well let's wrap up (87:48 - 87:52)
um (87:50 - 87:52)

the most part until the end where we'll (88:06 - 88:09)
start taking chat questions and stuff (88:08 - 88:10)
