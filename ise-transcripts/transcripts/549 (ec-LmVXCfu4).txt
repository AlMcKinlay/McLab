hello hello I am here uh Happy Lunar New (0:32 - 0:38)
Year I am taking every single chance I (0:36 - 0:39)
can get to celebrate the beginning of a (0:38 - 0:42)
new year (0:39 - 0:44)
and uh Greg and I decided to celebrate (0:42 - 0:46)
lunar and New Year by going to Mall of (0:44 - 0:50)
America yeah we sure did (0:46 - 0:50)
hey they had an event it was kind of (0:50 - 0:54)
they had an event there was a guy who's (0:52 - 0:55)
playing saxophone that sounded a lot (0:54 - 0:57)
more like Kenny G than I was expecting (0:55 - 0:59)
for her new year but (0:57 - 1:02)
we're there that works (0:59 - 1:06)
I also I uh quick uh just a quick (1:02 - 1:09)
Pokemon unite minute (1:06 - 1:09)
regilecki is no longer the necessary you (1:09 - 1:14)
have to go bottom again we're back to (1:12 - 1:16)
Dreadnought days (1:14 - 1:19)
new rules rotate the bottom (1:16 - 1:22)
the changes are bad but that's the so (1:19 - 1:25)
everybody stop going to a lucky first (1:22 - 1:28)
rotate the bottom (1:25 - 1:31)
he's a little electric hobby guy he is (1:28 - 1:33)
but it's no longer as important because (1:31 - 1:35)
they messed up the game again oh okay or (1:33 - 1:37)
did they did they are they trying to get (1:35 - 1:39)
those original people back they're just (1:37 - 1:41)
so used to yeah they're trying to get (1:39 - 1:43)
those original people back I'm probably (1:41 - 1:44)
who knows (1:43 - 1:47)
what's happening but I'm just letting (1:44 - 1:49)
you know (1:47 - 1:54)
rotate to the bottom again okay so we (1:49 - 1:56)
have Pokemon news to go through uh we (1:54 - 1:59)
have a little bit of Pokemon go uh I (1:56 - 2:00)
didn't think we would have to talk about (1:59 - 2:02)
the X and Y stuff but I guess we have to (2:00 - 2:04)
talk about the XY stuff because it keeps (2:02 - 2:05)
coming back up (2:04 - 2:07)
everyone knows how to no no everyone (2:05 - 2:10)
just reads headlines so that's that's (2:07 - 2:12)
been going on forever (2:10 - 2:15)
we have to do any corrections we could (2:12 - 2:17)
just say read the headlines and look no (2:15 - 2:19)
further that's not exclusive to Pokemon (2:17 - 2:21)
news people just like to read headlines (2:19 - 2:23)
yeah (2:21 - 2:25)
understandable (2:23 - 2:26)
um (2:25 - 2:28)
and the way crown Zenith just came out (2:26 - 2:30)
and then uh game freaks one of game (2:28 - 2:33)
freaks non-pokemon games uh is now on (2:30 - 2:34)
iOS (2:33 - 2:36)
so that's kind of cool I guess we could (2:34 - 2:37)
mention that I don't think we have to (2:36 - 2:38)
spend a lot of time on that I just (2:37 - 2:41)
thought it was worth mentioning uh let's (2:38 - 2:43)
start with uh Crown Zenith because that (2:41 - 2:45)
just came out (2:43 - 2:45)

yeah there's a lot of cards in the set (6:02 - 6:07)
too (6:05 - 6:09)
um it's it I will I will say this after (6:07 - 6:12)
opening an ETB in two of these like (6:09 - 6:16)
uh what do they call it collection boxes (6:12 - 6:18)
or whatever uh the polls the poll right (6:16 - 6:20)
seems good it does seem like a fun set (6:18 - 6:24)
to open the gallerian gallery cards are (6:20 - 6:26)
very pretty they're very fun to collect (6:24 - 6:29)
I have a question uh-huh (6:26 - 6:31)
uh according to this website there's a (6:29 - 6:34)
Dunsparce card is this correct (6:31 - 6:36)
uh there was probably a dunsparceus (6:34 - 6:39)
you did the book right here (6:36 - 6:42)
this is this is great for our uh audio (6:39 - 6:44)
listeners uh is is it a full art done (6:42 - 6:47)
sparse yeah under the on the website (6:44 - 6:50)
under gallerian gallery (6:47 - 6:52)
there's a full art done sparse of a (6:50 - 6:54)
bunch of cuties sleeping (6:52 - 6:57)
a bunch of Dunsparce cuties sleeping (6:54 - 6:59)
okay (6:57 - 7:01)
um I'm looking Greg I'm looking I I (6:59 - 7:04)
believe that's probably true there's a (7:01 - 7:06)
lot of as the press release says there (7:04 - 7:11)
are 70 a lot of cards there's a lot I'm (7:06 - 7:13)
not saying it done sparse all right will (7:11 - 7:15)
click on the click on the link I just (7:13 - 7:18)
sent you oh you linked me (7:15 - 7:18)
where am I where am I looking in the (7:24 - 7:28)
normal section what so do you not see a (7:25 - 7:31)
click for glarion gallery yeah (7:28 - 7:32)
okay (7:31 - 7:35)
okay go down like to the fourth fifth (7:32 - 7:37)
row I think (7:35 - 7:39)
the essay of evil I see a new one table (7:37 - 7:42)
is great oh I see the duns bars they're (7:39 - 7:45)
hiding under the the pillows yeah so you (7:42 - 7:48)
haven't pulled that yet no no no no (7:45 - 7:51)
I see yes he's here (7:48 - 7:53)
yes I pulled the caldeo which apparently (7:51 - 7:57)
is one of the top 10 sought after cards (7:53 - 7:59)
um the Mew card in this set is really (7:57 - 8:01)
cute yeah I wanted to pull the mute (7:59 - 8:05)
because there's the kramarine in it (8:01 - 8:07)
there's a cutie gallerian ponytail which (8:05 - 8:11)
makes it a gallerian card are these (8:07 - 8:14)
so the gallerian gallery does not (8:11 - 8:17)
feature many gallerian Pokemon is this a (8:14 - 8:19)
thing that's just (8:17 - 8:23)
why didn't they name it is that my Sears (8:19 - 8:25)
my favorite coloring Pokemon what are (8:23 - 8:27)
you talking about (8:25 - 8:29)
I mean (8:27 - 8:31)
I don't (8:29 - 8:33)
I don't understand the title of the (8:31 - 8:35)
gallery (8:33 - 8:37)
the city is very funny though it's a (8:35 - 8:38)
good card (8:37 - 8:41)
eating his little pear they've got a the (8:38 - 8:42)
very least pretend that this is a good (8:41 - 8:44)
send out for Galler (8:42 - 8:47)
true I mean this these cards are great (8:44 - 8:49)
but yes there's not a lot of Galler (8:47 - 8:53)
Pokemon and for some reason there's like (8:49 - 8:56)
uh multiple semi-sear cards um no (8:53 - 8:59)
Panpour no like the pores and the sages (8:56 - 9:01)
though they didn't make the cut only the (8:59 - 9:04)
fire one did uh I also like the gardenia (9:01 - 9:05)
card (9:04 - 9:07)
it's very cute yes I think that is also (9:05 - 9:11)
under the I feel like Korean gallery (9:07 - 9:13)
the card art just keeps getting better (9:11 - 9:15)
and better oh so many of these cards are (9:13 - 9:17)
just pretty (9:15 - 9:18)
yeah is this something magic is doing (9:17 - 9:20)
did like the Pokemon company look at (9:18 - 9:21)
Magic and was like oh their cards are (9:20 - 9:25)
pretty we gotta step it up so oh boy do (9:21 - 9:27)
you want to get into the craziness that (9:25 - 9:30)
our magic soap magic does do special art (9:27 - 9:34)
cards that can sometimes appear in (9:30 - 9:37)
their regular set but they also have (9:34 - 9:40)
this thing hold on (9:37 - 9:40)
called and I'll hold this up (9:41 - 9:48)
secret layers shiny secret layers are (9:44 - 9:50)
specialty cards (9:48 - 9:53)
for example (9:50 - 9:56)
sometimes they will do specialty uh (9:53 - 9:58)
collaborations like uh Magic and Street (9:56 - 10:00)
Fighter and they will put out special (9:58 - 10:03)
art cards or they'll work with a (10:00 - 10:05)
specific artist and be like this is this (10:03 - 10:09)
artist's four special art cards it's (10:05 - 10:12)
forty dollars (10:09 - 10:12)
oh didn't they have like some (10:12 - 10:15)
anniversary thing that was like I (10:13 - 10:16)
thought oh I'm not even gonna touch I'm (10:15 - 10:19)
not gonna touch doubt it (10:16 - 10:21)
I can't talk about that right now we (10:19 - 10:23)
can't go down the rabbit hole of how bad (10:21 - 10:26)
the 30th Anniversary fake card scam is (10:23 - 10:29)
because that's the whole podcast (10:26 - 10:32)
yeah so I would say (10:29 - 10:34)
like I've always said new set comes out (10:32 - 10:37)
is it worth buying is it not I think the (10:34 - 10:39)
last set was silver Tempest I don't (10:37 - 10:41)
think for a lot of casual people silver (10:39 - 10:43)
Tempest was worth picking up like (10:41 - 10:45)
obviously like if you're just itching to (10:43 - 10:47)
open some Pokemon cards sure get an ETV (10:45 - 10:50)
open the 10 8 booster packs have a good (10:47 - 10:53)
time if you are casual though and you're (10:50 - 10:56)
you're itching to open some packs and or (10:53 - 10:58)
burn a hole in your wallet I can think (10:56 - 11:00)
Crown Zenith is fun (10:58 - 11:01)
um I think there's a lot of good stuff (11:00 - 11:03)
in there this is not this is one of (11:01 - 11:04)
those um (11:03 - 11:07)
in between sets uh you can't just walk (11:04 - 11:10)
into Target and buy booster packs uh you (11:07 - 11:13)
can only buy the Box collections or the (11:10 - 11:15)
etbs or the tins which are not available (11:13 - 11:18)
right now but (11:15 - 11:20)
um unlike uh (11:18 - 11:23)
you know a silver Tempest or a chilling (11:20 - 11:26)
rain or a emerging Powers you just can't (11:23 - 11:27)
buy the booster packs off the shelf You (11:26 - 11:30)
Gotta Buy you gotta buy a box of (11:27 - 11:33)
assorted booster packs (11:30 - 11:36)
kind of frustrating yeah (11:33 - 11:41)
that's the whole mini collection I don't (11:36 - 11:42)
I don't know what they call these (11:41 - 11:44)
um special collections middle (11:42 - 11:46)
collections I can't remember (11:44 - 11:48)
but The Sword and the scarlet and violet (11:46 - 11:52)
stuff uh I believe comes out in March so (11:48 - 11:54)
that's when things will change to the (11:52 - 11:57)
silver borders and apparently rainbow (11:54 - 12:00)
cards will be in the thing of the past (11:57 - 12:03)
so (12:00 - 12:03)
um next bit of news here what happened (12:04 - 12:09)
to my news oh let's uh let's get the (12:07 - 12:10)
Pokemon Go stuff out of the way we (12:09 - 12:12)
didn't talk about this last week we (12:10 - 12:13)
probably should have uh Niantic just (12:12 - 12:17)
sent out a casual tweet here it's a good (12:13 - 12:22)
old casual Atlantic help trainers we are (12:17 - 12:24)
correcting the mega energy needed to (12:22 - 12:28)
evolve Mega salamance from 200 to 300 (12:24 - 12:31)
after the twinkling fantasy event we (12:28 - 12:35)
apologize for the inconvenience (12:31 - 12:35)
wow (12:35 - 12:39)
it's better than other bugs that have (12:37 - 12:40)
happened (12:39 - 12:42)
and the fact that they didn't correct it (12:40 - 12:44)
immediately and like they could have (12:42 - 12:47)
overcharged people and had people in (12:44 - 12:49)
negative Mega Energy they could have (12:47 - 12:51)
done that they didn't (12:49 - 12:51)
yeah I (12:52 - 12:56)
um (12:54 - 12:56)
biggest deal in the world because like (12:59 - 13:04)
what do you what do you get from (13:02 - 13:08)
I think normally I get like 225 or 200 (13:04 - 13:11)
from doing a mega raid granted I know I (13:08 - 13:14)
have a a privilege and an advantage of (13:11 - 13:16)
playing at Mall of America where (13:14 - 13:19)
people are always jumping in faster and (13:16 - 13:21)
then you can invite people and those (13:19 - 13:23)
people are inviting people so even even (13:21 - 13:26)
on a non-commune day even on like a (13:23 - 13:28)
random Tuesday you usually get like 12 (13:26 - 13:31)
14 people in a raid because Mall of (13:28 - 13:33)
America is just very busy all the time (13:31 - 13:36)
consistently uh so I don't know if (13:33 - 13:38)
people know this uh just sum it up real (13:36 - 13:41)
quick the faster you do a mega raid the (13:38 - 13:44)
more energy you get so that's kind of (13:41 - 13:45)
like the perk of you know having more (13:44 - 13:47)
people (13:45 - 13:49)
so ultimately (13:47 - 13:51)
I think even if you do it pretty slow (13:49 - 13:55)
you still need to do two (13:51 - 13:55)
like you're not getting 300 from one (13:56 - 14:01)
you're getting like yeah for the full (13:59 - 14:05)
cost five to fifty (14:01 - 14:08)
and so if you if you did it slow you're (14:05 - 14:11)
probably getting like 180 (14:08 - 14:13)
which is still not 200 so you have to do (14:11 - 14:15)
it again it (14:13 - 14:18)
I did ask Niantic about this I was like (14:15 - 14:20)
why are we changing it from 200 to 300 (14:18 - 14:22)
and they said game balance (14:20 - 14:24)
I don't (14:22 - 14:26)
okay I I don't know what the exactly (14:24 - 14:27)
they're balancing (14:26 - 14:31)
I think that that's the base cost for (14:27 - 14:34)
the rarer Pokemon for the Pokemon whose (14:31 - 14:36)
egg walking distances would be higher (14:34 - 14:38)
and things like that and Salamence is (14:36 - 14:41)
one of those I don't know for sure (14:38 - 14:44)
because I haven't started up one of (14:41 - 14:45)
those Mega Pokemon in a while I'm almost (14:44 - 14:48)
done maxing all of those out but I think (14:45 - 14:51)
that for Latias Latios and the Latias (14:48 - 14:53)
Latios yeah (14:51 - 14:56)
those may have started as 300 for (14:53 - 14:57)
initial (14:56 - 15:00)
megaing yes I'm looking at a lot TS (14:57 - 15:02)
right now it's 300 (15:00 - 15:04)
um and then let's just look at like a (15:02 - 15:07)
magnetic uh manectric is a hundred (15:04 - 15:10)
actually yeah there we go so it does (15:07 - 15:12)
vary based on the strength of the (15:10 - 15:15)
Pokemon probably or the Rarity the last (15:12 - 15:16)
one was like Glalie (15:15 - 15:18)
oh I already measured that one oh I only (15:16 - 15:20)
have one oh wait here's another glalius (15:18 - 15:23)
200. (15:20 - 15:23)
um (15:23 - 15:27)
so yeah I get I guess (15:24 - 15:29)
again I don't think it's the biggest I I (15:27 - 15:31)
would assume Metagross is going to be (15:29 - 15:34)
300 because almost definitely yeah (15:31 - 15:35)
because it's Metagross (15:34 - 15:38)
it's I I just don't the balance thing (15:35 - 15:41)
just throws me off because I'm again (15:38 - 15:45)
like is it bad that people are (15:41 - 15:48)
here's the thing maybe balance aside (15:45 - 15:49)
because I don't think that question can (15:48 - 15:52)
ever be answered I do think that Niantic (15:49 - 15:56)
puts a lot of weight in mega and like (15:52 - 15:59)
Mega Energy and I think Niantic cares (15:56 - 16:01)
about megas and Mega Energy a lot but (15:59 - 16:03)
like because they gave it they give it (16:01 - 16:04)
as a reward like oh you're getting like (16:03 - 16:07)
50 Mega Energy but (16:04 - 16:10)
it's really not that hard to get (16:07 - 16:12)
it is if you're trying to get mega (16:10 - 16:15)
energy for a Pokemon that is not in (16:12 - 16:17)
season yes yeah I will agree that's true (16:15 - 16:20)
that's true I had a hundo (16:17 - 16:22)
um (16:20 - 16:24)
names (16:22 - 16:24)
yes I had a hundo Houndoom for a year (16:29 - 16:34)
that I was waiting to Mega Evolve (16:32 - 16:35)
because I just didn't go out of my way (16:34 - 16:38)
to do the mega uh raids at the beginning (16:35 - 16:40)
when it was first introduced and I was (16:38 - 16:42)
not able to get the mega energy for it (16:40 - 16:44)
any other way until it was brought back (16:42 - 16:47)
into rights so when there are research (16:44 - 16:49)
tasks you can do that's super helpful (16:47 - 16:51)
but it doesn't always apply to all the (16:49 - 16:53)
Pokemon (16:51 - 16:53)
the weirdest thing about video game (16:54 - 17:01)
I love the start of the Sun (16:58 - 17:03)
the sort of weirdest thing about video (17:01 - 17:07)
game culture is the bizarre value people (17:03 - 17:10)
put on grind (17:07 - 17:10)
like (17:11 - 17:17)
it it boggles my mind how many people (17:12 - 17:21)
equate grind to Value including (17:17 - 17:23)
companies and companies sell this like (17:21 - 17:26)
oh you have to grind more salamance (17:23 - 17:30)
candy so it's more valuable it's like (17:26 - 17:32)
is it like (17:30 - 17:35)
you you are creating the false scarcity (17:32 - 17:37)
and you're making us grind and generally (17:35 - 17:39)
grinding isn't fun but you still have (17:37 - 17:42)
convinced an entire group of people that (17:39 - 17:46)
having to spend 58 hours finding one (17:42 - 17:48)
shiny in a dark corner is way more (17:46 - 17:50)
valuable than a pharamosa that showed up (17:48 - 17:53)
shiny first in your first Wormhole like (17:50 - 17:57)
it's so bizarre to me I hate I hate this (17:53 - 17:59)
grind equals value culture that they (17:57 - 18:01)
they keep cultivating that's not (17:59 - 18:03)
exclusive to Pokemon that's a lot of (18:01 - 18:05)
games no it's a ton of games yeah it is (18:03 - 18:07)
a ton of games (18:05 - 18:08)
um (18:07 - 18:10)
it's just what else equates to Value (18:08 - 18:12)
then (18:10 - 18:16)
that's just it it doesn't have any it's (18:12 - 18:19)
it's it is Data 70 premium rate passes (18:16 - 18:22)
in my inventory it's just data it is (18:19 - 18:25)
either time or money they can take or (18:22 - 18:29)
take away or or revoke at any time or (18:25 - 18:30)
add at any time (18:29 - 18:33)
like they themselves also will devalue (18:30 - 18:34)
their own think by saying hey we're (18:33 - 18:38)
giving out 15 incenses (18:34 - 18:40)
cool (18:38 - 18:42)
I'm just like (18:40 - 18:45)
I'm Niantic I I'm sure knows exactly how (18:42 - 18:47)
many megas are happening which megas are (18:45 - 18:49)
doing what you know all that stuff right (18:47 - 18:51)
like they have all that data oh yeah I (18:49 - 18:54)
would and the rehaul was a good system I (18:51 - 18:55)
do want to say that megas are actually (18:54 - 18:58)
useful now oh yeah yeah no no I do like (18:55 - 19:00)
megas yeah if I if I go out and even if (18:58 - 19:02)
I'm doing like a one hour grind I'm (19:00 - 19:04)
turning a mega on because at this point (19:02 - 19:06)
it's like free though so like I'm (19:04 - 19:09)
thinking like I I consider myself a (19:06 - 19:11)
relatively hardcore Pokemon go player (19:09 - 19:14)
I'm level 48 right (19:11 - 19:17)
um I I still think there's this weird (19:14 - 19:19)
perception where a lot of players think (19:17 - 19:21)
that a lot of hardcore players think (19:19 - 19:23)
that like the majority of people are (19:21 - 19:25)
over level 40. that's far from True nope (19:23 - 19:29)
yeah the majority of players are still (19:25 - 19:32)
under level 40. that's and Ninth is (19:29 - 19:33)
never going to come out and say that but (19:32 - 19:35)
that that is (19:33 - 19:38)
I don't know how we prove it but (19:35 - 19:41)
I mean we we can say we can draw a few (19:38 - 19:43)
things right like we can look at our (19:41 - 19:47)
friends list and see like I have 200 (19:43 - 19:49)
158 (19:47 - 19:51)
friends in my friend list right like it (19:49 - 19:54)
is it is not a controlled sample but it (19:51 - 19:58)
is a sample and I would say that (19:54 - 20:02)
at least 60 of them are under 40 still (19:58 - 20:05)
yeah I think it's swapped for me like (20:02 - 20:08)
and it depends on like your friend group (20:05 - 20:09)
I think the thing that like Steve and I (20:08 - 20:13)
can run into is that we just get random (20:09 - 20:16)
people who are like I found your friend (20:13 - 20:18)
code and I'm I'm sending it to you and (20:16 - 20:20)
whether or not they follow the rules and (20:18 - 20:21)
reach out to me and say who you are and (20:20 - 20:22)
that depends on whether they get added (20:21 - 20:26)
but like like if you are if your friend (20:22 - 20:28)
group is this is sort of the hard thing (20:26 - 20:32)
about any sort of anecdotal anything is (20:28 - 20:33)
if your friend group really really (20:32 - 20:36)
really likes Pokemon go they're all (20:33 - 20:38)
going to be over 40 and so therefore (20:36 - 20:39)
you're going to look at your experience (20:38 - 20:42)
and say well my experience is universal (20:39 - 20:44)
it's not (20:42 - 20:48)
but you have a view into how your group (20:44 - 20:51)
of friends plays that that really really (20:48 - 20:54)
like this game it's like I only play (20:51 - 20:57)
Final Fantasy with high-end Raiders so (20:54 - 20:59)
I'm like Well everybody's at 90 now and (20:57 - 21:01)
then I possibly fighting people who are (20:59 - 21:03)
like I just started the game right like (21:01 - 21:06)
just because I'm seeing it doesn't mean (21:03 - 21:08)
that that's reality (21:06 - 21:11)
it's just like (21:08 - 21:14)
we can look at what's randomly happening (21:11 - 21:16)
as people post things on Twitter I have (21:14 - 21:19)
a very random friend group in my friends (21:16 - 21:21)
and I'd be like okay well (21:19 - 21:23)
just because I accept a lot of different (21:21 - 21:25)
things from a lot of different people I (21:23 - 21:28)
can draw some parallels but it's (21:25 - 21:30)
definitely not the whole picture yeah I (21:28 - 21:33)
just like like there there are the there (21:30 - 21:34)
are the people that play on every (21:33 - 21:36)
Community Day they're the people that (21:34 - 21:37)
like (21:36 - 21:40)
obviously a lot of non-level 40 players (21:37 - 21:41)
go to go Fest or these other things (21:40 - 21:43)
right because there are events and (21:41 - 21:46)
whatever like I don't want to say like (21:43 - 21:47)
like even at the ultra Beast event I (21:46 - 21:48)
went to (21:47 - 21:51)
I saw way more people under level 40 (21:48 - 21:55)
than above level 40. because it was a (21:51 - 21:58)
free event in Los Angeles and obviously (21:55 - 22:00)
these rates filled up instantly for the (21:58 - 22:01)
ultra beast but I was just I wasn't (22:00 - 22:03)
shocked I was just like yeah this makes (22:01 - 22:07)
sense like like 38 34 or 24 or 25 like (22:03 - 22:11)
that's fine like obviously still doable (22:07 - 22:13)
I just like think (22:11 - 22:16)
like I'm pretty hardcore I'm not like a (22:13 - 22:19)
Brandon tan or somebody who has like 800 (22:16 - 22:21)
you know four star perfect buddies (22:19 - 22:23)
because they're doing like the buddy (22:21 - 22:25)
system on like six different buddies a (22:23 - 22:26)
day every day and they're spending money (22:25 - 22:28)
on poffins and stuff like that right (22:26 - 22:30)
like those are outliers complete (22:28 - 22:32)
outliers but (22:30 - 22:34)
like when the when a new Mega comes (22:32 - 22:35)
around (22:34 - 22:37)
like how many Pokemon are people megging (22:35 - 22:40)
like I I do like maybe three or four (22:37 - 22:43)
like glales right I have enough Mega (22:40 - 22:46)
candy I Mega maybe one maybe two glales (22:43 - 22:48)
like I'm gonna make a one that is like (22:46 - 22:50)
very good IVs and then I'm gonna make a (22:48 - 22:53)
shiny and now I have two decks entries I (22:50 - 22:54)
don't know why you would ever do a third (22:53 - 22:57)
or a fourth like (22:54 - 22:58)
and then once you Mega it it's (22:57 - 23:02)
technically free after that (22:58 - 23:02)
I have a edge case where you would want (23:03 - 23:08)
more than one that if there is an event (23:06 - 23:10)
featuring a specific type of Pokemon (23:08 - 23:12)
that there is only maybe one or two (23:10 - 23:15)
megas for that you would want more than (23:12 - 23:16)
one of those megas so that you could (23:15 - 23:18)
have a mega on constantly while you're (23:16 - 23:21)
playing this event throughout the week (23:18 - 23:23)
without spending more Mega candy or (23:21 - 23:25)
energy without spending more Mega Energy (23:23 - 23:28)
after that like like Altaria for (23:25 - 23:31)
twinkling fantasy yes (23:28 - 23:33)
yes so you would have wanted a ton of (23:31 - 23:36)
Altaria right ideally is that worth more (23:33 - 23:38)
because each altario would be 200 (23:36 - 23:41)
whereas like if you Mega Altaria the (23:38 - 23:42)
next day you could make it again (23:41 - 23:43)
technically but it would be like what (23:42 - 23:48)
like 56 or some weird like smaller (23:43 - 23:50)
number once you max out a mega Pokemon (23:48 - 23:55)
it is I think around 20 30 2 Mega it the (23:50 - 23:57)
next day after it's been Mega so if (23:55 - 23:59)
there is a week-long event (23:57 - 24:02)
no (23:59 - 24:02)
but it's easier (24:04 - 24:08)
but to be fair this isn't complaining (24:06 - 24:11)
about the mega mechanic it's just like (24:08 - 24:14)
this weird value that Niantic sees in (24:11 - 24:15)
Mega Energy (24:14 - 24:18)
yeah like I think I think the I think (24:15 - 24:20)
getting energy is fine I think using it (24:18 - 24:22)
is fine I think the mega system is great (24:20 - 24:24)
it's just like (24:22 - 24:27)
anyways I have to make it more valuable (24:24 - 24:30)
I guess tonight I think uh before we uh (24:27 - 24:33)
run to break here there is a new uh (24:30 - 24:36)
event coming featuring shiny tapu Coco (24:33 - 24:39)
and shiny Helioptile (24:36 - 24:41)
um which is called the crackling voltage (24:39 - 24:43)
event (24:41 - 24:45)
uh Atkins Magnemite grimer Electrike (24:43 - 24:49)
stunky who cannot be shiny um Blitzle (24:45 - 24:53)
uh Helioptile and grubbin also cannot be (24:49 - 24:54)
shiny it will be featured more in the (24:53 - 24:56)
wild if you're lucky you'll find Beldum (24:54 - 24:57)
or Dedenne in the wild (24:56 - 24:59)
um one star raids will feature alolan (24:57 - 25:01)
grimer Shanks (24:59 - 25:04)
um bronzer clink and helium tile three (25:01 - 25:05)
star raids is my favorite electric (25:04 - 25:08)
Pokemon venomoth yeah it's so good (25:05 - 25:12)
glarion wheezing also great electric (25:08 - 25:15)
type and more while and then five star (25:12 - 25:17)
raids are gonna be tapu Koko and Reggie (25:15 - 25:20)
steel Registeel also my favorite uh (25:17 - 25:22)
electric Pokemon (25:20 - 25:24)
and then the mega raids will be Mega (25:22 - 25:27)
Aerodactyl and Mega Gengar okay the Mega (25:24 - 25:29)
Aerodactyl also doesn't make sense (25:27 - 25:32)
because he's not ground is he ground no (25:29 - 25:33)
I don't think he's ground I think he's (25:32 - 25:35)
Rock flying isn't he uh I think so does (25:33 - 25:38)
it lose wouldn't it make us does it (25:35 - 25:40)
change because they did that and it got (25:38 - 25:42)
confusing (25:40 - 25:44)
I can't stand Mega aerodactyl's goatee (25:42 - 25:47)
it really throws that I hate it I think (25:44 - 25:50)
it's bad what do you mean (25:47 - 25:54)
um it's it grows up it becomes a hipster (25:50 - 25:54)
it looks like it stays Rock flying the (25:55 - 25:59)
entire time uh along with Andrew (25:57 - 26:01)
scarmery Blitzle stunfisk glare and (25:59 - 26:05)
stunfist uh Helioptile and Dedenne and (26:01 - 26:07)
then field research will be Voltorb his (26:05 - 26:09)
doing voltor Plusle and mine and Emolga (26:07 - 26:12)
and Helioptile though there will also be (26:09 - 26:13)
a team rocket takeover Wednesday (26:12 - 26:16)
February 1st to Sunday February 5th (26:13 - 26:17)
um (26:16 - 26:20)
where uh Giovanni will feature Shadow (26:17 - 26:22)
Reggie steel I think this is the first (26:20 - 26:24)
time ever yep (26:22 - 26:26)
um and then the Shadow Pokemon will be (26:24 - 26:29)
Shadow alolan Vulpix shadow spoink (26:26 - 26:33)
shadow Blitzle shadow joltec (26:29 - 26:35)
I (26:33 - 26:37)
don't know if these can be shiny they're (26:35 - 26:39)
not saying on the website they can be I (26:37 - 26:43)
mean jolte's tiny yeah the only Shadow (26:39 - 26:45)
Pokemon that can be shinier the ones (26:43 - 26:46)
that the team leaders are gonna have and (26:45 - 26:48)
I don't think those have been announced (26:46 - 26:51)
quite yet oh okay okay got it (26:48 - 26:53)
um and the Team Rocket part is arguably (26:51 - 26:56)
the more exciting event if you care (26:53 - 26:58)
about having the strongest Pokemon you (26:56 - 27:00)
have because you'll be able to TM (26:58 - 27:02)
frustration off of your Shadow Pokemon (27:00 - 27:03)
during that event (27:02 - 27:07)
these events come around rarely and they (27:03 - 27:08)
are not announced very far in advance (27:07 - 27:11)
and they don't come around regularly so (27:08 - 27:13)
getting frustration off of your Shadow (27:11 - 27:16)
Pokemon while you can is helpful yeah (27:13 - 27:18)
but you see I'm not a monster uh and I (27:16 - 27:24)
purify the sounds of my correct correct (27:18 - 27:24)
and then keep them in a tortured form (27:25 - 27:31)
they are in pain (27:28 - 27:33)
you're making me feel so bad about this (27:31 - 27:36)
yeah well leaving leaving a Pokemon (27:33 - 27:38)
Shadow means you're leaving them (27:36 - 27:41)
tortured and in pain weeping quietly (27:38 - 27:43)
hoping somebody will come and rescue (27:41 - 27:45)
them from another bad trainer who (27:43 - 27:47)
doesn't love them enough to free their (27:45 - 27:49)
hearts (27:47 - 27:52)
I uh also you cannot Mega Evolve the (27:49 - 27:55)
torture Soul you have to purify its (27:52 - 27:57)
heart to them because but Mega Evolution (27:55 - 28:02)
is a friendship the power of friends I I (27:57 - 28:03)
think I have like a Mewtwo that needs to (28:02 - 28:04)
be (28:03 - 28:08)
frustrated removed (28:04 - 28:08)
I don't know (28:08 - 28:12)
that's a lot of work I gotta wait for (28:10 - 28:14)
the event you gotta unfrustrate it you (28:12 - 28:16)
gotta gotta Power It Up still I got (28:14 - 28:18)
enough raid counters I don't need no (28:16 - 28:21)
more Shadow me too Mom (28:18 - 28:23)
are more important for PVP (28:21 - 28:25)
yeah yeah yeah yeah (28:23 - 28:26)
um (28:25 - 28:30)
that PVP players (28:26 - 28:32)
are evil (28:30 - 28:34)
they're all they all work for Team (28:32 - 28:37)
Rocket I think there's actually a (28:34 - 28:39)
an event recently where a shadow (28:37 - 28:42)
Charizard one go PVP I think I saw that (28:39 - 28:43)
this morning (28:42 - 28:45)
I think that might have been a (28:43 - 28:48)
Grassroots event though so (28:45 - 28:48)
uh let's take a break uh when we come (28:48 - 28:54)
back uh what's on the news docket here (28:51 - 28:55)
and when we come back we're gonna talk (28:54 - 28:56)
about Greninja which is coming to (28:55 - 29:00)
scarlet and violet uh some X and Y stuff (28:56 - 29:02)
and then pocket card jockey and we will (29:00 - 29:05)
be right back (29:02 - 29:09)
and we are back from our break so uh (29:05 - 29:11)

podcast will go up on the 23rd a (29:11 - 29:17)
Greninja is coming to scarlet and violet (29:13 - 29:19)

now a year of frog (29:19 - 29:24)
year of year of ninja frog (29:21 - 29:25)
um what are the exact dates on that (29:24 - 29:27)
where's my calendar uh the exact dates (29:25 - 29:29)
on that is technically it comes out on (29:27 - 29:33)
the 27th but because it's UTC time (29:29 - 29:36)
um if you're Central Time Zone that'll (29:33 - 29:39)
be 6 p.m Central Time Zone on January (29:36 - 29:42)
26th and that will go until 6 p.m (29:39 - 29:45)
Central Time Zone uh January 29th so (29:42 - 29:47)
this is the first round of Greninja and (29:45 - 29:49)
then Greninja will come back (29:47 - 29:52)
um on February 9th so in two weeks and (29:49 - 29:54)
then it will go until February 12th and (29:52 - 29:56)
then immediately when Greninja ends the (29:54 - 29:58)
Valentine's Day Panda Mouse raids will (29:56 - 30:01)
start so that's a little bit new I don't (29:58 - 30:02)
think in sword and shield we ever went (30:01 - 30:06)
exactly it from one raid event directly (30:02 - 30:07)
into another (30:06 - 30:08)
um usually it's always Thursday to (30:07 - 30:10)
Friday but as or sorry Thursday to (30:08 - 30:13)
Sunday and then (30:10 - 30:15)
Sunday ends and then we get we wait till (30:13 - 30:17)
the weekend again but as apparently (30:15 - 30:19)
tandemouse raids should start when (30:17 - 30:22)
Greninja ends the second time around (30:19 - 30:25)
uh I made a whole video of the six (30:22 - 30:27)
Greninja raid counters I would possibly (30:25 - 30:30)
recommend based off the data I did (30:27 - 30:32)
um so I don't need to go through that (30:30 - 30:34)
whole thing but just a little behind the (30:32 - 30:37)
scenes is I took Pokemon and then I (30:34 - 30:39)
would damage calculate the possible (30:37 - 30:41)
physical or special moves that Greninja (30:39 - 30:43)
would have and I would say okay well (30:41 - 30:45)
first off this Pokemon's surviving (30:43 - 30:46)
that's good (30:45 - 30:48)
secondly can this Pokemon do something (30:46 - 30:50)
to Greninja and or work in a team (30:48 - 30:54)
setting and then we would go through I (30:50 - 30:56)
personally think Greninja is going to be (30:54 - 30:59)
um special a special attacker or a mixed (30:56 - 31:01)
attacker (30:59 - 31:04)
um there are a lot of other builds out (31:01 - 31:05)
there because that's a popular thing (31:04 - 31:07)
it's like give me the Pokemon (31:05 - 31:09)
recommended uh that thinker ninja is (31:07 - 31:11)
going to be physical could be but the (31:09 - 31:13)
reason I think it's going to be special (31:11 - 31:15)
is because it's signature move uh water (31:13 - 31:18)
shurukin which I'm sure I'm saying wrong (31:15 - 31:20)
uh that's a special move and it's a (31:18 - 31:23)
signature move and the second reason I (31:20 - 31:24)
think that is because greninja's special (31:23 - 31:26)
attack is slightly higher than its (31:24 - 31:30)
physical attack that being said if it (31:26 - 31:31)
ends up being a mixed attacker I (31:30 - 31:32)
actually think that's like the easiest (31:31 - 31:35)
situation because when it's mixed it (31:32 - 31:39)
can't be all adamant or all modest if it (31:35 - 31:40)
was all adamant that would give it a (31:39 - 31:42)
boost to its physical attacks obviously (31:40 - 31:44)
and then it would never need to use its (31:42 - 31:46)
special attacks if it's modest that (31:44 - 31:48)
would boost all its special attacks and (31:46 - 31:49)
then its physical attacks would be a (31:48 - 31:52)
little bit weaker so even if it was like (31:49 - 31:55)
modest but mixed all its physical (31:52 - 31:59)
attacks get like a penalty kind of (31:55 - 32:00)
penalty (31:59 - 32:02)
um it could be I don't know timid Jolly (32:00 - 32:05)
naive bashful it could be a bunch of (32:02 - 32:07)
different things (32:05 - 32:11)
um but uh so so Charizard was modest and (32:07 - 32:13)
all of his attacks were special and then (32:11 - 32:15)
cinderace was adamant and all of its (32:13 - 32:17)
attacks were physical so it's very (32:15 - 32:20)
possible that this could be mixed but (32:17 - 32:22)
all the Pokemon I built on the YouTube (32:20 - 32:24)
video and in the graphics if you don't (32:22 - 32:26)
want to watch that's on Instagram (32:24 - 32:29)
uh they've survived both when I (32:26 - 32:31)
calculated it (32:29 - 32:33)
um so the only thing I wouldn't even (32:31 - 32:35)
change the movesets that much the only (32:33 - 32:36)
thing I would really change on this (32:35 - 32:38)
Pokemon I suggest is maybe flipping some (32:36 - 32:40)
of the EVS from a special defense to (32:38 - 32:43)
like a physical defense but (32:40 - 32:46)
um we'll know more uh well no more this (32:43 - 32:48)
weekend but at least it's a good (32:46 - 32:50)
starting place to be like okay I'm I'm (32:48 - 32:52)
not even sure where to start uh like (32:50 - 32:55)
What Pokemon do I even pick for Greninja (32:52 - 32:58)
a poison Greninja (32:55 - 33:00)
and of course (32:58 - 33:01)
they said we're not getting an update (33:00 - 33:04)
until the end of February so I'm (33:01 - 33:06)
expecting people to get stuck in the red (33:04 - 33:08)
menus (33:06 - 33:08)
that's the real the real final boss is (33:11 - 33:16)
how many frame rate how many frames do (33:13 - 33:18)
you have during the battle that's the (33:16 - 33:19)
real challenge you got to get through (33:18 - 33:21)
the raid experience in order to actually (33:19 - 33:24)
finish the raid yep (33:21 - 33:26)
you guys both got your Sunrise though (33:24 - 33:30)
right yeah yep I got it that first um (33:26 - 33:32)
the first one and then I I was gonna (33:30 - 33:36)
jump in and then my brain literally went (33:32 - 33:41)
no I don't no I can't I'm to be fair if (33:36 - 33:42)
you do want to grind them out I like (33:41 - 33:45)
grinding them out I made it to 999 (33:42 - 33:47)
whatever fighting shards so those are (33:45 - 33:50)
nice to have in case I decide to dip (33:47 - 33:53)
into competitive right I mean yeah it's (33:50 - 33:55)
50 shards of change that's a lot I mean (33:53 - 33:57)
I have (33:55 - 34:00)
no use for them right I'm never going to (33:57 - 34:03)
do competitive that doesn't make a like (34:00 - 34:05)
a difference (34:03 - 34:05)
people are like oh do you want to do the (34:09 - 34:14)
braid and I literally just stared at my (34:11 - 34:16)
because I was on the menu I'm like unite (34:14 - 34:19)
scarlet and violet I'm going to unite (34:16 - 34:23)
I'm I'm over here for the night yeah the (34:19 - 34:24)
other things that's nice is you get a (34:23 - 34:25)
lot of like (34:24 - 34:29)
uh candy to power like I think all my (34:25 - 34:30)
shinies in the game are level 100 just (34:29 - 34:31)
because I had so much candy I was like (34:30 - 34:33)
I'll pump them into something and then (34:31 - 34:37)
you get like the vitamins and (34:33 - 34:40)
I know you can just like grind out the (34:37 - 34:41)
tournament (34:40 - 34:44)
to get money (34:41 - 34:45)
um you just do the tournament over and (34:44 - 34:46)
over but (34:45 - 34:48)
it's nice to get so many vitamins where (34:46 - 34:51)
it's like oh cool now in the future (34:48 - 34:53)
like that's one less thing I have to buy (34:51 - 34:55)
because now I have like 600 of them just (34:53 - 34:58)
from doing cinderes all weekend (34:55 - 35:00)
so I I see both sides I see like I'm a (34:58 - 35:03)
one and done person and I see like hey I (35:00 - 35:04)
want to sit there and grind all it's (35:03 - 35:06)
very easy to grind when you have a bunch (35:04 - 35:06)
of people that also know what they're (35:06 - 35:09)
doing right like correct yeah I cannot (35:06 - 35:12)
imagine grinding with like evil let's (35:09 - 35:15)
jump into it I mean I did it so that (35:12 - 35:17)
first weekend I did like spend that (35:15 - 35:19)
weekend when I was gonna play I was just (35:17 - 35:22)
jumping into random raids and being like (35:19 - 35:24)
let's have fun (35:22 - 35:27)
my new my new toxic trait is I don't (35:24 - 35:30)
want to see a Zuma roll or iron hands or (35:27 - 35:34)
any of that stuff I want to see like (35:30 - 35:36)
Charmeleon like give me something really (35:34 - 35:39)
zoomy (35:36 - 35:39)
I did get a little bit picky yeah I did (35:39 - 35:45)
get a little bit picky on the second (35:44 - 35:47)
round of (35:45 - 35:49)
the rabbit coming back where I would (35:47 - 35:53)
just leave raid lobbies that had too (35:49 - 35:54)
many Pokemon in there that I knew were (35:53 - 35:58)
just gonna die yeah (35:54 - 36:01)
I think at this point it's like ah huh (35:58 - 36:03)
you picked Le chunk all right well let's (36:01 - 36:06)
see how this is gonna go yeah I look I (36:03 - 36:06)
am (36:06 - 36:09)
I am ride or die would I join a thing (36:06 - 36:11)
and I'm like click I don't care I'm (36:09 - 36:13)
clicking accept and we're gonna see how (36:11 - 36:15)
this turns out about it but (36:13 - 36:19)
I mean I I also defaulted ultimately to (36:15 - 36:21)
support because when you go into the (36:19 - 36:23)
raids with random people everybody's (36:21 - 36:26)
trying to attack and nobody else is (36:23 - 36:27)
playing support so I switched over from (36:26 - 36:30)
Arma Rouge to pelipper and just played (36:27 - 36:33)
support I have jumped into (36:30 - 36:35)
this is the thing that's happened to me (36:33 - 36:37)
a couple of times it is just I feel bad (36:35 - 36:40)
but I jumped into personally posted a (36:37 - 36:41)
code and I jumped in it I didn't realize (36:40 - 36:43)
they only had like (36:41 - 36:46)
30 seconds left (36:43 - 36:48)
so it took a while to register and in (36:46 - 36:50)
the middle of me going to pick my (36:48 - 36:52)
Pokemon (36:50 - 36:55)
The Raid started and it hovered over the (36:52 - 36:56)
one that I was on not the one I wanted (36:55 - 37:00)
to pick so I went into a six star I (36:56 - 37:02)
don't even know what it was (37:00 - 37:07)
with a level 20 Temple and I'm like (37:02 - 37:09)
I just sat there I'm like well I'm just (37:07 - 37:10)
gonna be in the cheer menu (37:09 - 37:14)
and I also have a Thunder Wave so I'm (37:10 - 37:15)
going to try that every once in a while (37:14 - 37:18)
and it worked once look hey not bad look (37:15 - 37:22)
we did it I'm gonna say my support was (37:18 - 37:24)
key because I think they all looked it (37:22 - 37:26)
went (37:24 - 37:27)
I don't know what's happening over this (37:26 - 37:30)
is madness so we're just gonna go all (37:27 - 37:32)
out and trust that they'll support us (37:30 - 37:35)
and I did it and we won but boy I'm like (37:32 - 37:38)
how because I was like how did I end up (37:35 - 37:41)
with this Pokemon how did this wasn't (37:38 - 37:43)
even in my list of ones that I'm (37:41 - 37:45)
carrying in my party (37:43 - 37:47)
and that's what I sort of paced together (37:45 - 37:49)
that I was in my box trying to get to (37:47 - 37:52)
the one that I wanted to use there's uh (37:49 - 37:53)
you so you know when you go to the right (37:52 - 37:57)
menu and it it like (37:53 - 38:00)
I I do think just Pokey portal is is (37:57 - 38:03)
better than wycom for the record I think (38:00 - 38:06)
it is structurally better uh I mean I (38:03 - 38:08)
think a lot of the I don't think it's (38:06 - 38:10)
Pokey portals part I just think the game (38:08 - 38:12)
is really laggy I don't think that's (38:10 - 38:15)
exclusive to poke portal but (38:12 - 38:16)
um number one I hate how they put the (38:15 - 38:19)
search on the far side because I feel (38:16 - 38:20)
like that's what people are using the (38:19 - 38:22)
most right is like or maybe I'm the (38:20 - 38:23)
exception like I always have to scroll (38:22 - 38:25)
over to go to search and then to type in (38:23 - 38:27)
a code I I kind of wish that was on the (38:25 - 38:28)
left side (38:27 - 38:30)
but below the search there's like a (38:28 - 38:33)
button because it's it's five it's five (38:30 - 38:35)
by two so it's like four raids on top (38:33 - 38:37)
four raids on the bottom and then the (38:35 - 38:38)
corner it's search and there's a button (38:37 - 38:40)
down there and I finally hit that button (38:38 - 38:41)
below search (38:40 - 38:43)
and it was like we are just gonna stick (38:41 - 38:46)
you in any random raid that exactly yeah (38:43 - 38:49)
but then it gives you a warning and it's (38:46 - 38:52)
like if you disconnect you will not be (38:49 - 38:55)
able to join any raid for a period of (38:52 - 38:58)
time so it actually like yells at you (38:55 - 39:02)
for disconnecting and it gives you a (38:58 - 39:03)
timeout penalty which I don't know how (39:02 - 39:05)
long I don't know if it's like five (39:03 - 39:07)
minutes or an hour I have no clue (39:05 - 39:10)
but I'm like that one why doesn't (39:07 - 39:12)
Pokemon unite have that (39:10 - 39:16)
like if you if you disconnect from unite (39:12 - 39:17)
you should have like an hour penalty of (39:16 - 39:18)
like not being able to join back in (39:17 - 39:20)
maybe they have added it since then I (39:18 - 39:23)
mean like if you deliberately AFK yeah (39:20 - 39:24)
you get (39:23 - 39:27)
it it is good at registering your Fair (39:24 - 39:30)
Play points so you can't yeah (39:27 - 39:34)
they have that a little bit but (39:30 - 39:37)
I mean they can't lean too heavily into (39:34 - 39:39)
that because people's mobile networks (39:37 - 39:45)
aren't stable yeah so if you AFK because (39:39 - 39:47)
you know your cell service dropped like (39:45 - 39:49)
they can't like for United get it (39:47 - 39:50)
because they can't be (39:49 - 39:53)
too harsh they can be harsher in the (39:50 - 39:54)
raid thing because you are literally (39:53 - 39:56)
having to go to random and being like (39:54 - 39:57)
yep I'm gonna do this and it's like hey (39:56 - 39:59)
we're gonna warn you up front if you're (39:57 - 40:03)
if your network goes out that button is (39:59 - 40:05)
not that different than like the random (40:03 - 40:07)
send race you can join and it doesn't (40:05 - 40:09)
give you a warning there if you DC you (40:07 - 40:11)
can at least prepare (40:09 - 40:13)
your Pokemon beforehand for the syndrace (40:11 - 40:15)
you can prepare the Pokemon beforehand (40:13 - 40:16)
for a raid you know you're going to be (40:15 - 40:18)
joining but if you're going into a (40:16 - 40:20)
random Pokemon and it just happens to be (40:18 - 40:21)
one that you do not have a good counter (40:20 - 40:22)
for (40:21 - 40:24)
and you drop from that because you don't (40:22 - 40:25)
have a good counter for that yeah (40:24 - 40:26)
because it locks you in and then you (40:25 - 40:28)
pick and you're like oh like I gotta (40:26 - 40:30)
watch the Viper and I was like oh I okay (40:28 - 40:34)
like but it wasn't like terribly hard I (40:30 - 40:35)
would like to see (40:34 - 40:37)
um like a actual like maybe like (40:35 - 40:39)
challenge mode that would be cool (40:37 - 40:42)
because I think it only does like four (40:39 - 40:45)
stars which is relatively easy compared (40:42 - 40:46)
to five or six I think four stars are (40:45 - 40:49)
like level 50 or 60. (40:46 - 40:49)
um I just thought that button was it I (40:50 - 40:52)
just thought the warning I was like oh (40:51 - 40:53)
man (40:52 - 40:57)
surprises me but it's there yeah in in (40:53 - 40:59)
December when I was feeling much more (40:57 - 41:02)
wild with that game I was very much like (40:59 - 41:04)
let's just hit random and see what (41:02 - 41:05)
happens (41:04 - 41:06)
um (41:05 - 41:08)
sometimes it's fun you know what my (41:06 - 41:11)
favorite thing in the game is it's just (41:08 - 41:15)
walking around what you think it said no (41:11 - 41:17)
well I mean ticking sounds fine it's (41:15 - 41:18)
just walking around and like finding a (41:17 - 41:20)
shiny and I know it's not a I know it's (41:18 - 41:23)
not efficient and I know it's not (41:20 - 41:26)
optimal but when I make a sandwich when (41:23 - 41:30)
I'm slapping rice and and ramen noodles (41:26 - 41:33)
not cooked onto a slab of bread (41:30 - 41:37)
and that timer starts of 30 minutes I I (41:33 - 41:40)
feel like everything in the world is is (41:37 - 41:42)
gone nothing matters I have I have (41:40 - 41:45)
wasted this Urban mystica and I I like (41:42 - 41:48)
if the cat is throwing up if I left the (41:45 - 41:51)
my child in the bathroom in the tub like (41:48 - 41:54)
you take a really long bath I'll clean (41:51 - 41:56)
up the throw up later like my 30 minutes (41:54 - 41:59)
is here and now I cannot stop for (41:56 - 42:00)
anything (41:59 - 42:03)
um and it's just very stressful and like (42:00 - 42:05)
when I'm when I'm when I'm in that mood (42:03 - 42:08)
I'm like okay or today's the day we're (42:05 - 42:10)
gonna get this shiny I'm gonna use I'm (42:08 - 42:11)
gonna do this sandwich we're gonna hunt (42:10 - 42:14)
right here it's all play like my battle (42:11 - 42:16)
plan is laid out like I'm in that (42:14 - 42:18)
sometimes I'm I'm in that zone but a lot (42:16 - 42:20)
of times I feel like I don't want that (42:18 - 42:22)
stress (42:20 - 42:22)
the thing is is I just find it so (42:23 - 42:29)
boring to just wander around yeah (42:29 - 42:38)
I would just walk yeah I enjoy it I am (42:34 - 42:40)
so the number of hours I've played in (42:38 - 42:42)
Pokemon Scarlet is almost reaching the (42:40 - 42:45)
number of hours I had for Pokemon sword (42:42 - 42:48)
and legends Arceus combined (42:45 - 42:50)
so I am playing a lot of Pokemon I get (42:48 - 42:52)
much better (42:50 - 42:52)
I'm not even sure I can say I like it (42:54 - 43:00)
better but there (42:56 - 43:00)
[Music] (43:00 - 43:05)
it does feel like the next big main (43:02 - 43:08)
series Pokemon game to me and it is and (43:05 - 43:10)
there are competitions that are gonna (43:08 - 43:13)
come from it there are uh updates that (43:10 - 43:14)
are going to happen to it there is (43:13 - 43:17)
probably going to be some DLC that there (43:14 - 43:19)
are story hints that I'm excited about (43:17 - 43:22)
and I'm actually working on completing (43:19 - 43:23)
the Pokedex for the first time in a (43:22 - 43:26)
while which I did do in Sword but a (43:23 - 43:29)
while after I could (43:26 - 43:32)
um I don't know I am enjoying this game (43:29 - 43:33)
I don't know if I would say it's better (43:32 - 43:37)
I think I enjoyed Arceus more because I (43:33 - 43:39)
liked the design style more and Greg I (43:37 - 43:42)
know you hated it but I loved it what no (43:39 - 43:45)
the Arceus (43:42 - 43:47)
no Greg you hate the colors and the (43:45 - 43:49)
other thing I hate is the colors I hate (43:47 - 43:51)
I like the colors the second area just (43:49 - 43:55)
looks like a giant mud pit I mean (43:51 - 43:57)
we're gonna go to the mud pit we're (43:55 - 44:02)
gonna get Pokemon oh sloppy come on down (43:57 - 44:07)
to the Metro Joe Sunday Sunday Sunday (44:02 - 44:07)
in in both Arceus and in scarlet and (44:07 - 44:13)
violet you can run around and just make (44:10 - 44:14)
progress by running around and doing (44:13 - 44:17)
stuff and just sort of casually having (44:14 - 44:20)
fun in the game and in scarlet and (44:17 - 44:23)
violet uh that can actually progress (44:20 - 44:25)
towards (44:23 - 44:27)
bigger goals if shiny hunting isn't your (44:25 - 44:29)
ultimate goal because there is (44:27 - 44:32)
competitive stuff there is going to be (44:29 - 44:36)
more of a national day or not not going (44:32 - 44:39)
to say national parks larger Pokedex (44:36 - 44:43)
Bam Bam getting closer but no I don't (44:39 - 44:45)
know I've been working on completing the (44:43 - 44:47)
Pokedex in there and 400 is a lot I (44:45 - 44:50)
can't even imagine but (44:47 - 44:52)
yeah I think 400 is that is that spot (44:50 - 44:54)
they figured out it wasn't (44:52 - 44:57)
um ultrasound Ultra Moon and then it was (44:54 - 44:58)
in sword and shield and now it's in this (44:57 - 45:00)
game so I think (44:58 - 45:01)
I mean I think before the games even (45:00 - 45:03)
came out I always reference like I'm (45:01 - 45:04)
gonna guess there's gonna be 400 Pokemon (45:03 - 45:07)
that's what ended up happening is 400 so (45:04 - 45:10)
I think that's a good number I think (45:07 - 45:13)
it's big enough where it feels like (45:10 - 45:15)
okay it's a lot of work but it it it's (45:13 - 45:17)
small enough where it doesn't feel like (45:15 - 45:19)
it's not obtainable like I remember (45:17 - 45:21)
going back to X and Y and you have to (45:19 - 45:24)
get all 600 and (45:21 - 45:26)
50 I don't know I don't know how many (45:24 - 45:29)
639 (45:26 - 45:31)
um somebody will correct me uh it's more (45:29 - 45:33)
than 600 uh in X and Y (45:31 - 45:36)
uh no it has to be close to 700 because (45:33 - 45:39)
Vivion is 666. (45:36 - 45:41)
so it has to be closer to 700. that's a (45:39 - 45:43)
lot of Pokemon that's what that that's a (45:41 - 45:45)
lot of Pokemon (45:43 - 45:49)
um and and X and Y was very ambitious uh (45:45 - 45:52)
and uh they that game had plenty of its (45:49 - 45:53)
own issues uh I want to remind everyone (45:52 - 45:57)
horde battles if if you loved the leg of (45:53 - 45:58)
horror battles you would love the leg (45:57 - 46:01)
that is in Scarlet Violet because uh (45:58 - 46:03)
those were things speaking of X and Y (46:01 - 46:05)
though perfect transition (46:03 - 46:06)
um there's a lot of articles about this (46:05 - 46:10)
I just pulled comicbook.com uh (46:06 - 46:14)
there was a there was a tweet that went (46:10 - 46:15)
out it's always why is it always the (46:14 - 46:17)
Spanish Twitter it's always Spanish what (46:15 - 46:22)
is up Spain what are you doing (46:17 - 46:25)
um so uh Spanish Twitter noticed that (46:22 - 46:27)
game freak renewed (46:25 - 46:33)
the the trademarks to X and Y so (46:27 - 46:35)
let's just read a little bit here (46:33 - 46:37)
Twitter Twitter (46:35 - 46:39)
uh found out that Nintendo game freaking (46:37 - 46:41)
creatures recently renewed the (46:39 - 46:43)
registrations for Pokemon X and Y logos (46:41 - 46:44)
in Japan (46:43 - 46:46)
as a result of this information coming (46:44 - 46:48)
out a number of Pokemon fans determine (46:46 - 46:49)
that game freak might look to remake (46:48 - 46:52)
Pokemon X and Y next with the intent of (46:49 - 46:53)
re-releasing new versions of these (46:52 - 46:55)
installments on the Nintendo switch As (46:53 - 46:57)
and while these remakes might come down (46:55 - 46:58)
the road it doesn't seem like we should (46:57 - 46:59)
expect anything soon (46:58 - 47:02)
so uh comicbook.com goes on and says (46:59 - 47:04)
although the reason wasn't given by Game (47:02 - 47:06)
Freak or Nintendo when it comes to these (47:04 - 47:09)
Pokemon X and Y logo noodles the real (47:06 - 47:11)
real purpose behind these why they were (47:09 - 47:13)
registered once again is because it's (47:11 - 47:14)
been nearly a decade since these (47:13 - 47:16)
installments were first revealed most (47:14 - 47:18)
logo and trademark registrations tend to (47:16 - 47:21)
run a course of 10 years which means (47:18 - 47:23)
that the period time has come up and (47:21 - 47:26)
companies need to reapply uh and to to (47:23 - 47:28)
renew their registrations as such it is (47:26 - 47:31)
likely this was done with X and Y fans (47:28 - 47:33)
shouldn't think anything more at the (47:31 - 47:33)
time (47:33 - 47:35)
DLC is coming we're going back to (47:33 - 47:38)
Kayla's baby (47:35 - 47:38)
I have high hopes for the DLC but it's (47:38 - 47:42)
not that (47:40 - 47:45)
they renewed the truck they would do (47:42 - 47:47)
it wasn't coming in the DLC why would (47:45 - 47:48)
they why would they renew the trademark (47:47 - 47:50)
at the 10-year Mark which is legally (47:48 - 47:52)
required to maintain the trademark so it (47:50 - 47:53)
doesn't fall out and can be used by (47:52 - 47:55)
somebody else if they weren't going to (47:53 - 47:57)
make a DLC I mean you wouldn't just (47:55 - 47:59)
renew a trademark I'd do nothing with it (47:57 - 48:01)
Greg are you in my Instagram comments (47:59 - 48:04)
right now (48:01 - 48:07)
read them look I am the distilled (48:04 - 48:09)
internet at this moment (48:07 - 48:11)
there's (48:09 - 48:14)
oh look I don't I don't think we're (48:11 - 48:15)
getting I've said this time and time (48:14 - 48:17)
again I don't think the DLC is going to (48:15 - 48:20)
take us back to Kalos (48:17 - 48:22)
um there's a couple reasons why whether (48:20 - 48:23)
or not you agree with me that that's (48:22 - 48:26)
fine uh number one is Game Freak likes (48:23 - 48:27)
money (48:26 - 48:31)
and uh we know that second versions and (48:27 - 48:34)
DLC does not sell as well as (48:31 - 48:37)
re-releasing games and putting them on (48:34 - 48:38)
store shelves and having a giant (48:37 - 48:41)
marketing Pusher about about the around (48:38 - 48:43)
them sorry (48:41 - 48:47)
as much as (48:43 - 48:47)
fans myself included hated brilliant (48:47 - 48:52)
Diamond shining Pearl (48:50 - 48:54)
I think in the (48:52 - 48:56)
look I I don't know what the Casual (48:54 - 48:58)
perspective of that game is but at least (48:56 - 49:01)
from every other Pokemon Creator and (48:58 - 49:03)
Twitter and Diamond brilliant Diamond (49:01 - 49:06)
shining Pro are not liked I there's (49:03 - 49:07)
probably five people listening to the (49:06 - 49:09)
show that they love that game cool that (49:07 - 49:13)
being said there is no doubt that those (49:09 - 49:15)
games sold incredibly well we know that (49:13 - 49:18)
myself they sold incredibly well (49:15 - 49:21)
um and uh you could maybe argue they (49:18 - 49:22)
sold better than Legend Arceus because (49:21 - 49:24)
there was two copies and not one but (49:22 - 49:26)
they did technically sell better than (49:24 - 49:28)
Legends Arceus at this point in time (49:26 - 49:30)
maybe in six months when we can say on (49:28 - 49:32)
the podcast that Legends Arceus outsold (49:30 - 49:34)
brilliant Diamond shining Pro it hasn't (49:32 - 49:37)
yet uh technically really Diamond (49:34 - 49:39)
shining Pearl also had a holiday push (49:37 - 49:40)
they came out right before Christmas (49:39 - 49:43)
Legends came after Christmas there's a (49:40 - 49:45)
lot that goes into that but the fact of (49:43 - 49:47)
the matter is (49:45 - 49:51)
these remade games that were not even (49:47 - 49:53)
made by game freak that were Faithfully (49:51 - 49:56)
badly optimized (49:53 - 50:00)
their words faithful uh outsold a brand (49:56 - 50:02)
new very ambitious game like that's what (50:00 - 50:05)
happened so I do find it hard to believe (50:02 - 50:07)
that game freak wouldn't want to sorry (50:05 - 50:09)
not getting freak the Pokemon company (50:07 - 50:11)
made me makes this decision they (50:09 - 50:13)
wouldn't want to put X and Y on store (50:11 - 50:14)
shelves (50:13 - 50:18)
in a fully repackaged remade form now I (50:14 - 50:22)
also don't see them selling us a whole (50:18 - 50:26)
new region for 30 to 40 dollars I just (50:22 - 50:29)
don't see that especially (50:26 - 50:32)
when there is mixed (50:29 - 50:35)
taste on scarlet and violet (50:32 - 50:38)
like the game runs very poorly that's (50:35 - 50:40)
been talked about a lot there are (50:38 - 50:41)
probably people that were on the fence (50:40 - 50:43)
they've they heard that the frame rate (50:41 - 50:45)
was bad the game wasn't optimized blah (50:43 - 50:49)
blah blah and they didn't buy it (50:45 - 50:51)
um if anything (50:49 - 50:54)
I don't even want DLC I want the game to (50:51 - 50:56)
work better yeah before we add more (50:54 - 50:59)
content (50:56 - 50:59)
her (50:59 - 51:01)
um (51:00 - 51:05)
thirdly when we talk about (51:01 - 51:08)
the conversation of oh my gosh Pokemon (51:05 - 51:10)
games are so rushed I wish they would (51:08 - 51:12)
take another year or two (51:10 - 51:15)
we have this open world brand new (51:12 - 51:16)
experience Pokemon game and I'm not (51:15 - 51:19)
defending that it hasn't been rushed (51:16 - 51:21)
like we we've talked about on the show (51:19 - 51:24)
multiple times the Pokemon the Pokemon (51:21 - 51:27)
machine has to fire on all cylinders (51:24 - 51:29)
whether or not this game was ready or (51:27 - 51:31)
not they needed to get it out because (51:29 - 51:33)
the anime is coming because the TCG is (51:31 - 51:35)
coming because the holidays because the (51:33 - 51:36)
next game is coming (51:35 - 51:39)
do you think that this company who had (51:36 - 51:41)
barely got this game out the door can (51:39 - 51:44)
then add on an open world Kalos (51:41 - 51:47)
experience in less than a year do we (51:44 - 51:50)
think that that's even plausible yeah (51:47 - 51:53)
because callus is already created so you (51:50 - 51:55)
copy (51:53 - 52:00)
see control V like what what is it it is (51:55 - 52:04)
just coding like kids in high school (52:00 - 52:07)
code yeah that's true (52:04 - 52:09)
um (52:07 - 52:14)
so even if I was like yes I just can't (52:09 - 52:17)
put the logic behind like (52:14 - 52:19)
yep we're going to do this whole region (52:17 - 52:21)
and then if you go like well well it's (52:19 - 52:22)
not going to be open world it's like (52:21 - 52:24)
well that doesn't make sense you're (52:22 - 52:26)
going from an open world game to like (52:24 - 52:29)
we're back to this linear experience (52:26 - 52:32)
the other thing is (52:29 - 52:32)
I feel like it's it would be such a (52:33 - 52:39)
discredit to the paudia region (52:36 - 52:42)
to have all of this interesting and (52:39 - 52:45)
unique lore about these legendaries (52:42 - 52:47)
about the past about the future about (52:45 - 52:50)
the time machine I still kind of believe (52:47 - 52:53)
that the professors are alive (52:50 - 52:57)
and that ending was like a weird kind of (52:53 - 52:59)
throwaway like maybe they didn't (52:57 - 53:00)
actually die because we didn't see them (52:59 - 53:02)
die right it's kind of like the classic (53:00 - 53:06)
I didn't see the body so yeah (53:02 - 53:06)
um (53:06 - 53:09)
and why would you just want to go to (53:07 - 53:11)
another region and not have any of those (53:09 - 53:13)
questions answered yeah there's clearly (53:11 - 53:16)
so many questions left for paldea and I (53:13 - 53:18)
don't know address it directly in the (53:16 - 53:20)
story I don't know if the people asking (53:18 - 53:22)
for the remakes went to the school but (53:20 - 53:24)
the school gives you a million (53:22 - 53:26)
unanswered questions and I know some (53:24 - 53:28)
people are like well the crater (53:26 - 53:33)
the giant flower cannon from X and Y the (53:28 - 53:35)
flower cannon was 3 000 years ago we (53:33 - 53:37)
know that the crater is a million years (53:35 - 53:39)
old because the school tells us that (53:37 - 53:41)
like the school gives us so much (53:39 - 53:43)
information about the the crater in (53:41 - 53:47)
paldea and it has nothing to do with the (53:43 - 53:50)
flower cannon and X and Y (53:47 - 53:54)
like there's just not enough (53:50 - 53:57)
things adding up to be like yep we're (53:54 - 53:59)
going to Callos (53:57 - 54:01)
and I guess people could say well like (53:59 - 54:02)
oh Froakie (54:01 - 54:05)
Fennekin Chestnut or in the game code (54:02 - 54:09)
yeah I mean so so is this problem and uh (54:05 - 54:11)
Cyndaquil and (54:09 - 54:14)
Oshawott and so is (54:11 - 54:17)
score Bunny gurkey and Cinder it's like (54:14 - 54:20)
the only thing that's hard enough ties (54:17 - 54:22)
there is weird (54:20 - 54:25)
pal Dan Empire (54:22 - 54:28)
things that happen (54:25 - 54:31)
after the Canon war that was supposed to (54:28 - 54:33)
happen in Cala so it's not like the (54:31 - 54:35)
crater was created by the calendar but (54:33 - 54:37)
there are other history lessons (54:35 - 54:41)
if you look at it that like tie to the (54:37 - 54:43)
events of the big war that was happening (54:41 - 54:47)
over in Kalos like there are weird (54:43 - 54:49)
parallels there I'm not saying we're (54:47 - 54:51)
going to go explore ancient chaos and (54:49 - 54:53)
definitely the Canon didn't cause the (54:51 - 54:57)
crater but they do hint as part of (54:53 - 54:59)
fitting paldea into the larger world (54:57 - 55:03)
that the events of that war did affect (54:59 - 55:07)
the Empire of paldea here just making it (55:03 - 55:10)
as a bigger World thing right like (55:07 - 55:14)
these things are happening as far as the (55:10 - 55:16)
over arcing lore (55:14 - 55:18)
um but no the crater wasn't caused by (55:16 - 55:20)
the cannon but the cannon did have an (55:18 - 55:22)
effect and that war did have an effect (55:20 - 55:25)
on the Pokemon world as a whole and they (55:22 - 55:27)
did they acknowledge it (55:25 - 55:29)
a little like you have to really draw (55:27 - 55:32)
some some faint lines there but they do (55:29 - 55:34)
at least sort of hint but I don't think (55:32 - 55:36)
that's enough to say and then we're (55:34 - 55:37)
gonna go into the pass and explore that (55:36 - 55:41)
war no like that is not what's gonna (55:37 - 55:43)
happen here (55:41 - 55:43)
I I I absolutely adore X and Y I think (55:44 - 55:49)
they're fantastic games (55:47 - 55:51)
um minus the story stuff I mean Pitbull (55:49 - 55:52)
shows up at like the end at one point (55:51 - 55:56)
that's kind of cool uh Mr worldwide (55:52 - 56:00)
but like X and Y got (55:56 - 56:04)
a it got kind of like the The Johto (56:00 - 56:06)
treatment almost where like Johto could (56:04 - 56:08)
have had a lot more but their option was (56:06 - 56:11)
like let's go let's go back to Kanto and (56:08 - 56:12)
it's like oh but there's so much here in (56:11 - 56:14)
Johto that we could be like talking (56:12 - 56:17)
about and then Kalos just didn't get (56:14 - 56:18)
anything right we never got a Pokemon Z (56:17 - 56:21)
we never got a Pokemon XX or YY or XZ (56:18 - 56:24)
right we didn't get anything (56:21 - 56:26)
um so there's a lot of things unanswered (56:24 - 56:30)
in Kalos and so ideally or hopefully if (56:26 - 56:33)
there is a Kalos remake one day which (56:30 - 56:34)
realistically I guess would be after (56:33 - 56:36)
Black and White remix if we're going in (56:34 - 56:37)
order (56:36 - 56:39)
like you would hope that they can expand (56:37 - 56:42)
on that I don't think they could expand (56:39 - 56:43)
on that (56:42 - 56:46)
uh like they could give us the same (56:43 - 56:49)
stuff in a DLC for paldea but do you (56:46 - 56:50)
think they can give us the same stuff (56:49 - 56:53)
and also expand on that and then not (56:50 - 56:56)
want to sell that to us at full price (56:53 - 56:59)
like it and then then what happens to (56:56 - 57:02)
paldea we we miss out on that stuff like (56:59 - 57:04)
I want to know more about the treasures (57:02 - 57:06)
I want to know more about the past I (57:04 - 57:07)
want to know about the future is this (57:06 - 57:08)
time machine actually a time machine (57:07 - 57:12)
like there's so many unanswered (57:08 - 57:14)
questions (57:12 - 57:15)
not only with the crater but like (57:14 - 57:17)
multiple things that pop up in the (57:15 - 57:19)
school that like (57:17 - 57:21)
we're just gonna like throw that all (57:19 - 57:23)
away and not answer it for this just to (57:21 - 57:25)
go back to Kalos like it just it just (57:23 - 57:27)
seems like a lose-lose it seems like not (57:25 - 57:29)
only does paldeo lose by going to Kalos (57:27 - 57:32)
but Kalos loses by not (57:29 - 57:35)
having its own brand new development (57:32 - 57:39)
cycle where we can like not have what (57:35 - 57:41)
happened to Pokemon Z which is like just (57:39 - 57:44)
not fill out (57:41 - 57:48)
the that that that generation of games (57:44 - 57:50)
generation six (57:48 - 57:50)
as much as I dislike auras (57:51 - 57:54)
um (57:53 - 57:57)
auras like felt full it like felt like (57:54 - 57:59)
it filled out a lot of stuff and I think (57:57 - 58:00)
that's why I was personally disappointed (57:59 - 58:02)
with brilliant Diamond shotting Pro (58:00 - 58:03)
because I was like oh this is (58:02 - 58:06)
the same didn't really like add anything (58:03 - 58:09)
I mean I mean Legends filled that out (58:06 - 58:12)
better Platinum had filled most of the (58:09 - 58:14)
questions (58:12 - 58:16)
and then there wasn't (58:14 - 58:17)
there was that I don't think there's a (58:16 - 58:19)
lot of questions that were left (58:17 - 58:21)
unanswered about the diamond pearl (58:19 - 58:23)
Platinum (58:21 - 58:26)
well I mean that goes back to like why (58:23 - 58:28)
didn't bdsp have the Platinum stuff (58:26 - 58:29)
because like (58:28 - 58:33)
that was the better stuff yeah uh I mean (58:29 - 58:35)
there's not a ton it the thing is is (58:33 - 58:38)
like (58:35 - 58:38)
it's the Star Wars problem like how many (58:39 - 58:44)
questions (58:42 - 58:47)
should be answered before it diminishes (58:44 - 58:49)
the experience (58:47 - 58:52)
because sometimes the better answer the (58:49 - 58:54)
question is that they never really (58:52 - 58:57)
answer it so that you are free to fill (58:54 - 59:02)
in and and speculate on it and ponder it (58:57 - 59:04)
whereas you know we've run into a (59:02 - 59:08)
problem uh in Star Wars where a lot of (59:04 - 59:10)
people feel like I didn't (59:08 - 59:12)
I didn't need an answer for that that (59:10 - 59:15)
could have just been a mystery that I (59:12 - 59:17)
that we all got to ruminate on forever (59:15 - 59:19)
right we did not need an answer to that (59:17 - 59:22)
we didn't need to know how like I don't (59:19 - 59:24)
need to know how they built the glass (59:22 - 59:27)
cabin like I don't need this information (59:24 - 59:29)
it's better if they don't answer it (59:27 - 59:31)
because well they took a bunch of (59:29 - 59:33)
cragonal cryogonals and they crushed (59:31 - 59:35)
them (59:33 - 59:35)
came along and (59:36 - 59:40)
yeah so anyways um (59:41 - 59:45)
uh trademark renewal is common (59:45 - 59:50)
nothing less (59:52 - 59:57)
the is the one company that's like it's (59:55 - 59:59)
not enough to renew the trademark we're (59:57 - 60:01)
going to make a live-action movie out of (59:59 - 60:03)
it just to put a nail in that coffin so (60:01 - 60:05)
nobody can (60:03 - 60:08)
and all come at us (60:05 - 60:11)
I would I I anticipate the day where we (60:08 - 60:14)
get X and Y remix whether that's in five (60:11 - 60:17)
years or ten years or whenever right (60:14 - 60:19)
um I would assume that all the mega (60:17 - 60:21)
people will be very happy that Megos (60:19 - 60:23)
will be back I'm sure they will add new (60:21 - 60:25)
megas I'm sure like Zygarde will (60:23 - 60:28)
hopefully get an actual decent storyline (60:25 - 60:32)
um that isn't thrown away to a very poor (60:28 - 60:35)
bad movie like there's a lot about (60:32 - 60:39)
X and Y that I absolutely adore and so (60:35 - 60:41)
when I say like I don't think palde is (60:39 - 60:43)
getting X and Y DLC I just think there's (60:41 - 60:46)
way too many holes in that plot plus (60:43 - 60:48)
like (60:46 - 60:48)
I I I want the current engine of scarlet (60:48 - 60:56)
and violet to run so much better and (60:52 - 60:59)
maybe it can't maybe this is just what (60:56 - 61:01)
generation 9 is is this like (60:59 - 61:03)
first time doing open world kind of (61:01 - 61:06)
experience maybe gen 10 it'll be better (61:03 - 61:09)
and then maybe everything after that (61:06 - 61:12)
will be smoother and and and better (61:09 - 61:13)
um (61:12 - 61:17)
I like girl and violet but (61:13 - 61:17)
we have to wait till that big update or (61:18 - 61:23)
that February update to see what what (61:20 - 61:24)
the future of that game looks like I (61:23 - 61:26)
mean well Pokemon day update fixes (61:24 - 61:30)
everything yeah it fixes everything I (61:26 - 61:32)
heard it gives you your money back oh (61:30 - 61:36)
that's that this is the update we need (61:32 - 61:37)
all right last bit of news we don't have (61:36 - 61:41)
to spend a lot of time on it but (61:37 - 61:44)
uh where is my (61:41 - 61:49)
the show notes Here there uh so the game (61:44 - 61:52)
freak made a game back in the day called (61:49 - 61:54)
pocket card jockey and it was available (61:52 - 61:56)
in 3DS and it's still available on the (61:54 - 61:58)
3DS and it's about seven dollars so (61:56 - 62:02)
before the 3DS eShop shuts down in March (61:58 - 62:06)
I think uh if you want one of the best (62:02 - 62:08)
game freak games of all time I'm not (62:06 - 62:10)
being sarcastic I really genuinely think (62:08 - 62:12)
it's a very good game uh it is seven (62:10 - 62:14)
dollars in the eShop so you might maybe (62:12 - 62:16)
you should get it it's called pocket (62:14 - 62:18)
card jockey now game freak wasn't (62:16 - 62:21)
involved in this remake I believe it was (62:18 - 62:23)
pushed on to another company (62:21 - 62:27)
um but it was launched 10 years ago look (62:23 - 62:28)
at that 10 years (62:27 - 62:33)
uh it is now an apple arcade uh (62:28 - 62:35)
and unfortunately you do have to turn (62:33 - 62:38)
your phone sideways (62:35 - 62:38)
um (62:38 - 62:42)
oh is this the one no required me to (62:38 - 62:44)
sign up for Apple arcade and I have no (62:42 - 62:46)
interest inside (62:44 - 62:46)
I've already played pocket card jockey (62:47 - 62:50)
so I don't know if I would play it again (62:49 - 62:51)
but the screenshots look great like (62:50 - 62:53)
brand new graphics (62:51 - 62:56)
um it's a it's a combination of (62:53 - 63:00)
horse racing and Solitaire and May and I (62:56 - 63:02)
understand that that might sound boring (63:00 - 63:05)
but holy cow is it incredible and it's (63:02 - 63:07)
super fun it's like a weird version of (63:05 - 63:09)
Solitaire it's not like you're like (63:07 - 63:10)
Grandma's Solitaire (63:09 - 63:13)
yeah it's really fast-paced also you can (63:10 - 63:15)
like breed horses together and you get (63:13 - 63:17)
special horses (63:15 - 63:19)
um that's pretty cool is there a ditto (63:17 - 63:21)
horse there is no ditto horse there is a (63:19 - 63:23)
horse that there's a couple horses that (63:21 - 63:26)
have Pokemon references (63:23 - 63:27)
um I can't remember them off to the top (63:26 - 63:30)
of my head but if you have apple arcade (63:27 - 63:31)
it's free because that's the whole point (63:30 - 63:33)
of Apple arcane (63:31 - 63:34)
um if you bought anything from Apple in (63:33 - 63:36)
the last year you probably had like 18 (63:34 - 63:37)
months of Apple arcade free because (63:36 - 63:40)
they're handing that out (63:37 - 63:42)
um (63:40 - 63:42)
but uh I I think I think this game is (63:42 - 63:48)
absolutely fantastic I think the (63:46 - 63:49)
writing's really good it's genuinely (63:48 - 63:53)
funny the gameplay Loop is really great (63:49 - 63:54)
um (63:53 - 63:57)
yeah it it it sucks because like it (63:54 - 64:00)
makes sense why game freak kind of just (63:57 - 64:03)
goes all in on Pokemon because this is (64:00 - 64:06)
genuinely such a fantastic game and no (64:03 - 64:07)
one played it (64:06 - 64:11)
and it sucks because it was like dirt (64:07 - 64:13)
cheap I think when it came out it was (64:11 - 64:14)
like ten dollars it's down to like seven (64:13 - 64:16)
dollars or eight dollars now and it's (64:14 - 64:18)
like really Charming really cute really (64:16 - 64:20)
fun (64:18 - 64:22)
um really good gameplay (64:20 - 64:25)
but I don't know (64:22 - 64:25)
if if their best non-pokemon game isn't (64:26 - 64:30)
getting in the hands of people it kind (64:28 - 64:32)
of makes sense why they just I guess we (64:30 - 64:33)
go back to Pokemon (64:32 - 64:38)
go back to thing that makes us money (64:33 - 64:38)
so (64:38 - 64:44)
um yeah I think that's all we got (64:40 - 64:44)
uh (64:44 - 64:48)
you can pre-order scarlet and violet (64:45 - 64:50)
etbs on Pokemon Center you get a free (64:48 - 64:52)
promo lechon card I think we talked (64:50 - 64:53)
about this that yeah we talked about (64:52 - 64:55)
electronics that week uh there's a giant (64:53 - 64:58)
200 Arceus statue on pokemoncenter.com I (64:55 - 65:00)
heard a Hannah ordered five of them (64:58 - 65:03)
already I wish there's (65:00 - 65:03)
expensive (65:04 - 65:08)
expensive it's a real nice looking (65:06 - 65:12)
though they are so good like I looked at (65:08 - 65:14)
them like huh (65:12 - 65:16)
maybe and then I looked at the price and (65:14 - 65:19)
went oh yeah (65:16 - 65:19)
it's 200 but it is (65:21 - 65:26)
like okay if I was (65:24 - 65:30)
an Arceus fan like Arceus was my my (65:26 - 65:33)
number one I would absolutely probably (65:30 - 65:35)
get this because I don't think so you're (65:33 - 65:37)
saying you would do a 200 Roselia oh (65:35 - 65:39)
heck yeah do you know how much money I (65:37 - 65:42)
spent on Roselia stuff (65:39 - 65:44)
what if it was okay here's here's a (65:42 - 65:46)
here's a deeper question I just bought (65:44 - 65:48)
somebody's shiny sticker (65:46 - 65:52)
it's gorgeous what if it was like not (65:48 - 65:53)
specifically Rosalia but a bunch of (65:52 - 65:56)
grass type Pokemon but Rosalia was one (65:53 - 65:58)
of the grass two hundred dollars he's (65:56 - 66:01)
still pulling the trigger yeah okay all (65:58 - 66:02)
right that's fair (66:01 - 66:03)
you know to be fair if there was like a (66:02 - 66:05)
200 crameran statue I'd probably yeah (66:03 - 66:08)
you would buy it look you buy it you buy (66:05 - 66:10)
it pokeballs for a hundred dollars each (66:08 - 66:12)
so you have no legs to stand on here it (66:10 - 66:16)
is it is I I I (66:12 - 66:17)
I think they're fantastic I love (66:16 - 66:19)
collecting them I'm not a Funko Pop (66:17 - 66:22)
collector I know people that have walls (66:19 - 66:26)
and shelves and millions of Funko Pops I (66:22 - 66:29)
I get it I get it from a collector (66:26 - 66:31)
perspective of like I like this thing (66:29 - 66:33)
and I want as many as possible I just (66:31 - 66:34)
don't like (66:33 - 66:37)
one the way Funko Pops look and two I (66:34 - 66:38)
just don't like the quality they got a (66:37 - 66:40)
good price point though like they're (66:38 - 66:42)
like what 12 bucks so they're like (66:40 - 66:44)
you walk in you buy three and it's (66:42 - 66:47)
really not that big of a deal I have I (66:44 - 66:50)
am limiting myself to the 12 pokeballs (66:47 - 66:51)
instead of the hundred dollar Pokemon oh (66:50 - 66:53)
yeah they're still pretty good quality (66:51 - 66:55)
yeah they're still really good quality (66:53 - 66:57)
yeah they're not a hundred dollars okay (66:55 - 67:00)
I'm on Pokemon center.com just a quick (66:57 - 67:03)
thing so they have these (67:00 - 67:06)
vaporia and Jolteon comfy plush (67:03 - 67:10)
I'd look good they did Flareon dirty (67:06 - 67:12)
with these comfy plushes yeah Jolteon (67:10 - 67:14)
the only one that looks Happy Well JoJo (67:12 - 67:15)
is happy (67:14 - 67:17)
[Laughter] (67:15 - 67:18)
Play Ride doesn't even seem to have a (67:17 - 67:20)
mouth I mean Flareon fans know what (67:18 - 67:21)
they're getting (67:20 - 67:23)
disappointment (67:21 - 67:26)
I mean (67:23 - 67:26)
oh no the vaporin is sad actually yeah (67:28 - 67:33)
yeah Victorian is sad it's just not like (67:30 - 67:37)
uh I guess (67:33 - 67:37)
that boy though it works for it yeah I (67:39 - 67:43)
mean at least vapore Angel didn't have (67:41 - 67:46)
like Expressions Flareon not only looks (67:43 - 67:48)
like they just stuck clouds around it (67:46 - 67:50)
instead of flame but it also just has no (67:48 - 67:52)
mouth (67:50 - 67:55)
I think it's almost like an O mouth like (67:52 - 67:59)
oh oh why bad (67:55 - 68:02)
you want Flareon to be fluffy (67:59 - 68:03)
you can never actually hug a flare (68:02 - 68:04)
around but you want to flare around (68:03 - 68:07)
plush to be fluffy yeah (68:04 - 68:09)
uh The Comfy friend stuff uh they've (68:07 - 68:10)
they did like the Denny and swab blue (68:09 - 68:12)
and a bunch of other comfy friends so (68:10 - 68:15)
not surprising (68:12 - 68:17)
comfy friends let chalk I'm mine for (68:15 - 68:20)
that there was actually a chunk piggy (68:17 - 68:21)
bank (68:20 - 68:24)
in Japan I'm curious I saw that so we'll (68:21 - 68:26)
