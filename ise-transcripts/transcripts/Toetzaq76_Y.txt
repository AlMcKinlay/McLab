hey what's going on this episode was a little bit weird because we recorded like three hours of content and I try for 90 minutes I think we got it to like just under two hours so you're probably like what happened to the other hour well two things one this episode has about a 45 minute now maybe it's like 40 minute interview with Nate real breaking Nate youtuber content creator we talked about his love of Pokemon where he started from if you're one of Nate's fans this is your first time listening hopefully you enjoyed the whole entire episode but the Nate part starts about 50 minutes in the first part is news and whatnot the other thing is we actually recorded news second this episode and we spent the first 45 minutes talking about leaked culture like people leaking stuff not necessarily the Pokemon leaks that have existed those are out there you can go see them if you want we don't talk about them we talked about how these leaks are different or maybe the same as the Sun and Moon leaks and the X&Y leaks so again not specifically talking about we don't talk at all about whatcha pokemon have or have not been shown we just talk about the what has happened in the past and what should happen going forward with that well that's not in this episode I cut that all it was about 45 minutes so what we're doing instead is this episode we'll start with some ring fit adventure only because we'll and Greg wanted me to talk about it and then we talked about pokemon news and then the interview with Nate and then we come back and we do our question of the week and our Pokemon of the week so pretty much like a standard episode at 45 minutes about what happened with past Pokemon games leaked wise and what's happening with this Pokemon game that's going to be over on the patreon for free so even if you're not a patreon backer you can go to ISE cash or patreon.com slash it's super effective and you'll be able to listen to at 45 minutes completely freed you don't go sign-in you have to make an account you'd have to do anything you want to support him can you do you but that'll be completely free if you need something extra in the week to listen to I think Greg and will had excellent points I guess I tried to play devil's advocate for stuff just so we didn't all talk on the same points but it's if you wanted to know what happened with like the X&Y stuff and the Sun and Moon stuff and what's happening here and not worried about being spoiled of you know score Barney's evolution because we don't again really stressed and we don't talk about any of that I think you should check it out is C dot cache probably the easiest thing to remember or in the show notes where it says patreon just click that link takes you right there if you want to listen if you need some bonus content for the week otherwise sorry this is a really long intro so hopefully you enjoy [Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 380 third 83rd 8380 third episode of the pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host s BJ hi I feel like we haven't done this in forever but it's we do it every week I don't know what every week well some of us do it every week I don't know what happened in the last like seven days I am here we're here to talk about Pokemon Greg is here Greg welcome back hello is it because you actually exercised I have a major week I have well wait wait wait wait wait I had a few things to say about that but I was going to wait to be politely introduced before I made my commentary well will is here Shepard let's pile it on all right so I'm part of the boys now I got no no no I am the only one here with a six pack true I mean I have a 12 pack in my fridge hey I was I was I was getting ready I was very excited to induct you into the association of clangers and bangers okay and then I watched that twitch stream and I'm sorry but jumping up and down with a squishy score circle in your hand does not count as either clanging and/or banging no no way shapes in it's squishing in fishing mmm okay oh hold on hold on this is a teasing Pokemon podcast but let's like take two minutes to talk about ring fit healthy living segments returning welcome to healthy living are you doubting these are you saying that you think the ring fit thing is squishy is that super hard to press it you had to squeeze it in order to fire off your your shots at the though when you we had to fly and you were doing the the run in place and fly and jump and get the coins yeah I had to squeeze and then it was like you got to keep squeezing it dude you're not squeezing it long enough the only thing I thought was you attempting to do squats my spots were inform you or not you were not inform I beg to differ well okay so they mmm so for those add-ons for over your toes ring-ring fit Adventure is a Nintendo published game made by I actually don't know who made it Nintendo's I don't know what part of Nintendo made it Nintendo has like 14 Nintendo fit but Nando torture chamber disclosure they they sent me this it's but it's a it's a fitness game you could maybe say it's like Wii Fit where you put the joy Khan into what what is the proper it's like a yoga ring I don't know what they're actually called it's not a real thing so call it whatever you want a squeezy Pilates ring that's what its gonna know Pilates going on there what are you where was there's no reformer what is hurry forward that is what you use for Pilates because I think anyone watching and not experiencing ring fit looks that looks at it and probably thinks it's like a gimmick like Wii Fit although like Wii Fit the problem with Wii Fit is there's like no feedback of whether you're doing something right or wrong right because the the board doesn't vibrate or doesn't give you resistance or any sort of peed back to tell you're doing something correct or incorrect I guess though like it could tell your balance but the the Pilates ring that it comes with I mean you can get a Pilates ring for like 15 bucks on Amazon you put the joique on on and the whole Pilates ring gives you feedback and stuff and you have to squeeze it and hold it or pull it if you go back and watch my first stream I'm doing it and okay so the part the whole part in the game is like you're you're getting a workout and doing an RPG so you're like going through the world and the monsters pop up and then it's almost like a Pokemon or a final fantasy where like you have to they attack you you have to attack them you defeat them you move on in the world more monsters pop up and then eventually you're fighting this giant workout dragon who has like a 30 pack and these where's William R Anderson right there that's the only workout dragon I care about so I'm doing it the first day because okay and there's four levels there's like casual moderate intense and extreme and I was like well I have never I haven't done any exercise in like two years I used to run a long time ago so I was like I'll do intense because I doubt it's like a gimmick yeah well I think it's a gimmick so I doubt I will actually get a decent workout from this and like within you know I think my first workout was like 45 minutes within 20 minutes I'm like sweating my legs feel like noodles my arms feel like noodles and then my wife Irene comes in and she's just laughing at me you can see this on stream she's like making making fun of me she's telling me that I need to squat lower she's quite lower okay but why at that point my legs are like completes liquid noodles maybe eat fewer noodles and so then twitch chat bless their hearts they convinced Irene to do it and Irene was like well I I read and works out more than I do so she also did intense because she had to match slash beat me and within like 15 minutes she's like sweating and she's like apologizing to twitch chat for making fun of me because she was like oh my gosh I didn't realize like this is a real thing like I'm act my arms hurt like this game made me break a sweat it's really cool what I mean if you're already going to the gym I don't know if like this is what you need in life is certainly not what I need in life so correct question answered I want to fight the workout because it sounds good but I don't need it for sure if you're not going to a gym well if you are going to a gym yeah like I said you probably don't need it but I guess like if there was like an off chance where you can't go to the gym and you need like a quick 45 minute workout at home I guess you could do this I mean it might be good for those times when I'm traveling and a few steps Toto there's things that there's things in the workout that you don't need the ring for but you also besides like the ring there's like a leg strap that you put on so in this case we're like the game makes you do crunches oh my favorite the leg strap is like you you can't use the ring for crunches but the leg strap judges you I guess on that and again my life judging me it's it's cool it's very cool I I'm wondering where the novelty runs off with somebody I I heard that if you do the recommended workout every day which i think is like 30 minutes it'll take you to 90 days to like beat the story mode so my question is after seven days does a person climb out of your whatever screen your switch is attached to and like I don't know she killed them or yeah yeah yeah I get it yes that movie you know that movie myth and other things Jesus I mean October was just three days ago and how soon you all forgets the good googly Gauri's loyal boy it is countdown to thanksgiving American style no no no I've met your husband it's always Ghoulie Gauri's in your home he's not a lot of watch Cooley Gauri's while I'm here oh man she gives me nightmares okay so this is our plan for the episode we have this episode and we have next week's episode and then sword and shield are available so next week we're doing something a little bit special I will leave it there you guys can look forward to it next week but that's next week is our from what what's the date on that the sari xi xi now it'd be the 10th oh that one the 10th will were the 10th we're recording when it comes out so xi enter be the last full normal episode of ISE and then starting on the 15th 16th 17th 18th you'll be getting daily episodes like we've done for Sun and Moon and X&Y and we skipped Omega Ruby alpha sapphire pity best game ever so there before we get into news we just should just close this there was at this point as of recording pretty much all the Pokemon have leaked from sword and shield whether that was through somebody it seemed that somebody probably bought a copy at a Mon pawn shop and they were taking pictures of their switch screen but then it looks like that somebody was maybe working in like a warehouse with the guidebook and they were taking pictures of that and you would assume they were maybe scared they were getting caught because we live in 2019 I don't understand how you can take super blurry photos even if you had the chicken smartphone in the entire world and then recently it looks like somebody else has a has a book as well a guide book and they're taking much better pictures of said guidebook so that's out there if you want to go seek that out I'm sure it's very easy let's tackle some news here let's start with some anime news is off Eurogamer pokemon news and pokemons new TV season will tell us the story of baby Pikachu there is a new trailer for the new anime which I believe in English version I only saw the Japanese version isn't due until like April but the Japanese version comes out later this month because it's Geoff pan is on top of releasing their anime when the new games come out so they don't have to translate them that's true so the episode synopsis from crunchyroll says in a forest somewhere in Kanto there once was a lonely Picchu is Picchu who was still quite young had a certain encounter and farewell this took place shortly before Ash and his partner Pikachu started travelling together this is the beginning of the anime Pocket Monsters hmm looks like they're the start of this the season might have some flashbacks too Ash and Pikachu I don't know if well pre ash Pikachu yes but there are there isn't there is a Pikachu or is it Pichu this is a Pichu so this will be Ash's Pikachu as a Pichu which we've never seen before so the episode that aired today in Japan shows Ash going back to going somewhere he gets on a train and leaves a Lola or he's on he's on some vehicle I'm assuming at the Train I guess it could be something else so they they do have him leaving the aloha region at the end of this season while ash I guess normally technically gets reboot I mean he he still has all his Pokemon with Professor Oak as we saw it drops a mile off in Kanto Sun and Moon there is a scene from the new trailer where he throws his pokeball at the wall the little piggy like when he's late to get his starter Pokemon so they recreated that scene again so we don't know fully is is that a flashback scene or are they just going to do the first episode again again oh but now that they're like telling a backstory of Pichu it seems more likely that there's gonna be probably a lot of flashbacks in the first couple episodes of how this how their relationship formed so Oh interesting but with the deal I'll flash back to our with it just about like the first episode - sort of getting that backstory and then do flashbacks throughout the seat season I don't know it's according to Eurogamer this very first episode will be this very Pichu focus focused I'm intrigued although I have such a hard time watching any kind of television anymore look forward to that speaking of Sun and Moon as of Friday the newest TCG set just came out cosmic eclipse the stuff Pokemon calm at the eh-eh okay sure can we talk about how angry all the baby Pokemon a look is that for clever who's always just there for a good time did you see like the little if you get emails from Pokemon there's like a little animation in the email of like the babies getting ready to battle like Pocky and Dialga and Pam yeah things like that yeah they're like bye I'm like why are you sweet baby so bad it's very well done and very cute this says the apex of Sun and Moon series the Pokemon TCG Sun and Moon cosmic eclipse expansion boosts the connection of Pokemon and trainers and at lon tag-team combinations to new levels jump into battle with Charizard and Brack Sein GX venusaur and Snivy GX Blastoise and Piplup GX and so gay Leo and Luna la GX along with triple tag teams like Arceus and dialga and Palkia GX plus many more feel the stellar power of pokemon with sun and moon cosmic eclipse expansion over 230 cards nine brand new tag team G act Pokemon GX 7 more pokemon GX the first appearance of tag team supporter cards and more than 20 trainer and new special energy cards and this set has a whopping 230 cards Kula and 5 of them are actually good so I'm assuming the Arceus dialga Palkia is much like the other trio card never gonna see play probably like so in it it has 1 attack and a GX attack and the one attack includes a water a metal and a colorless energy which I can tell you right off the bat most decks don't run to different types of energy so that already seems pretty bad who knows though I mean there might be they might be might be so good that it might be worth running up to split energy deck this a few energies is not that bad yeah but it's the three energies you're asking for too much usually it's never three though they usually it's like 100 all one energy oh like half half one energy and like three of a different or you're running like a ho deck where you're running one of every energy I think you're like getting them in the discard pile as fast as possible because like that's how hos mechanic always works I want to say as I'm like talking and looking this up I want to say this is the last Sun and Moon set oh it should be we are done because they've already shown GRU key they've already shown groupies oblong score bunny cards yes according to Bob poppy dia this is the last Sun and Moon set and then the next set should be going into sword and shield which I don't think besides the the cards I just named oh I guess Goerke score bunny Sowell's a Shion and zama Zenta V cards were shown so that is supposed to come out in Japanese on December 6 and then in English on February 7th and the English set will have 87 cards the Japanese oh sorry the English set will have 212 200 cards and the Japanese set will have 120 which means that between the time of the December release in Japan and the February release in English Japan will probably have a bunch of mini sets come out like they always do think with this we are we are completely like caught up ish I think now that Cod when cosmic because Cosmic Encounter just came out I think Japan and and America are now caught up with sets I don't think John has any cards that we don't at this point this full art cuffing card is incredible looking the art Oh full arts are always great yeah I doubt like from cosmic it's so good Oh The Roxy card yeah it's incredible it is very good I mean the the Magnemite cards cute and so is the Pikachu but like the coughing is just like it just like hits you it's so impactful what the anchor caitlin and cynthia doing teaming up oh come on let's not even stir that hot buddy you are so dubious near you they are very good friends who enjoy a summer home on the you Nova coast thank you uh-huh who would that folk around GX heck yeah I'm buying that as a single and framing it for my wall that is that is beautiful hopefully it's not a Garbo card move it onto things you can buy this is a Pokemon calm November first plush train cars and more holiday surprises at Pokemon Center deck the halls with Pikachu Eevee and their Pokemon friends thanks to a new line of products they do this every year they pick a couple Pokemon and they put Christmasy things to them and they sell them in the shop the interesting thing they're doing this year though is Pokemon Center is debuting a special line of collectible holiday train cars a new train car will be able but will be available for purchase every Monday in November once you collect all four train cars you can arrange them together to form a wonderfully whimsical scene and as a special gift you will receive a reusable Pikachu shopping bag if you purchase one or two items but if you purchase three or more items you will receive a larger bag as a gift bags our available while supplies last pre-order items and funko purchases not available for gift offer well that giant sucking sound was Greg's wallet betray something like Christmas tree don't you oh it's just killing me inside how much I want that stupid train but by the time this episode goes up we'll know how much it costs or each train part cost we'll know what it's made out of I think it looks it looks ceramic right yeah it's probably like most of those types which is a ceramic table topper like there's like a million of those style although I'm on the website right now and this delibird presents holiday crew net sweatshirt I also need that incredibly bad well here's good on Christmas items do you have here's the the 200 IQ play Greg you put what you want in your cart and then when the train drops you add it you check out yeah I don't have that kind of money I'm assuming that this is my guess the train is gonna be $25 if you want the whole thing it's a hundred that'd be my dad do I guess hmm usually they are 30 to 35 those things are expensive but they could be think I mean 25 isn't out of the ballpark I think it's a little low but what if you split that on your Christmas list and each of your friends brought you one of the cars they're instantly selling out on Monday there's not a doubt in my mind that this is what's gonna happen I'm gonna buy a train cart number one and then I'm going to sleep through train car number two and then I'm gonna get three or four and then I got a resort to eBay to spend like 80 dollars I'm trained card number two I have it's a hundred percent what's gonna happen yeah well I guess it gives me a reason to wake up early on Mondays yeah I mean I'm definitely looking and saying how much they are and deciding if I want it I'm just excited that the Pokemon ornaments that I bought back at Target in 1999 the fat Pikachu will once again be relevant girly yeah the ornament was the old sale Pikachu so now that it's Giganta max like me like I asked Giganta max me let me get that uh Pokemon holiday pokeball tree topper treats where's the tree topper I had just click on the Holiday Collection it's like the six item oh no that's that's is ugly what about this what about the $50 holiday skirt so I would be tempted to get that except the dogs always attack that fringe and since it's on the ground because it's a skirt like all I do all holiday is get them away from the fuzz so that's a that's a no-go for me unfortunately I am very tempted by the chespin's Snowman which is beyond cute oh there that's been in stock for four years now I doesn't matter I'm still tempted by it the Pikachu holiday pokeball stocking hook okay / cute the ball Peck stocking holiday crewneck actually all the crew necks I adore but I think the delibird presents is the best and then I don't have an Eevee ornament ornaments are my weakness like my Christmas tree is absolutely I usually buy one ornament a year like new to add and since I don't have a needy like I feel like ants have so they have to look that's also not that expensive ornament I mean depending what it's made out of it looks like it's made of which is ideal because then it won't fall and break as easily yeah because I have some very expensive ornaments that I'm like I I am so nervous putting that up every year cuz I don't want it to fall and break but I'm very very tempted by this Eevee holiday or Amex I do need a new ornament this year thank you so cute it's so well done except the Lebel in its mouth is subtle it's giving me the wink like hey it's Christmas blank love it I hate Christmas so well I will not be spending any money you're saving money left and right then yup I will take all of your Christmas for you you may have it I know sorry your locally you can decide to fill out my Christmas picks this year or not on a CD mm-hmm CDs Marcus is hard to burn them nothing birth nothing burn CDs in my house anymore she's like nobody birth CDs Itamar I have nothing that works this is off Pokemon go live cabal iam the iron will Pokemon come into five star raids the steel in fighting legendary Pokemon is to have a body and heart of steel it will be from Monday November 4th so when this podcast goes up to Tuesday at November 26 co Balian is part of a trio of Pokemon said to have challenged humans in order to protect other Pokemon the three are rarely seen apart so look forward forward to meeting the other two soon and the meanwhile go build up your teams in preparation for battle yeah I'm gonna have to get this thing the stars I love the source of justice a lot they're pretty they're pretty alright yeah this alright well okay the movie swords a movie not good no not good but better than the power of us yeah well look that's not that's not a high bar okay I'm actually curious of what they'll do with this because just like how the three Reggie's are kind of required lore wise to summon regigigas the three in this trio are kind of part of the lore of Calvillo and how Calvillo wants to be part of the trio hence that movie that movie is literally focused on Calvillo trying to be part of the the musketeer trio and the ins name is in the name of the movie yes that being just things that makes things worse that being said they they did do an event which was I would say lore wise we talked about this on the show of like maybe they'll have an event where you kind of have to catch all three or have all three in your party in order to catch or I get regigigas and they pretty much did that this weekend I already know the answer but I'm gonna ask you as anyways did you participate in the regigigas colossal event Gregg you go first now my D&D group was could finally meet so I did that instead that's fine okay so I spent the $8 excuse me all right I was like let me go out on the limb and I spent $10 okay $7.99 in the u.s. sure and on Saturdays I'm back to my old schedule of where I do like a six mile hike on Saturdays and that's a good like pokemons go thing for me so I was out there doing my hike it hit 11 a.m. talked to the professor and he's like here's your first task and the way I looked at it was I thought they gave me a complete on the first part because I have regice oh yeah and then it was like catch eight rock pokémon evolve eight rock pokémon and I did those uh-huh and I was like it's not going to the next step what's up and then I looked at it again and it was like you need to catch one of the Reggie's in a raid and I was like well I'm not going to be doing any raids today so the end well except that that involves going to the mall which is no I see once you live in Minnesota all of a sudden becomes an effort to go to the mall not another modern expert but the people the humanity of it I was not in a people move okay yesterday so I shared my thoughts on Twitter Greg you didn't do it so if you have any questions regarding this event okay feel free to ask I know the other registers are shiny because I saw I Irene got a shiny register which like was that like the excitement that was the highlight of the day sure yeah her giving her getting a shiny was very forgetting the shiny she really wanted out of any shiny ever released in Pokemon history was was very exciting I was I was very happy that she walked away with a shiny Reggie Steele because that is top three of her favorite Pokemon all time so how many steps like how many steps were in the was it like the seven stepper was it a three stepper it's a four step so real quick just to piggyback off this Co Balian I can totally see them doing the regigigas event again in the future for whatever another eight dollars to get Keldeo we're to the point now in Pokemon go where there are too many mythical Pokemon or just too many legendary Pokemon in general in this case with regigigas because it was so tied to lore Wiis on the show you know a couple months ago said hey maybe they'll have Reggie's come back and you'll have to catch all three to get regigigas to show up and then we were like a that doesn't really make sense for a lot of people but they kind of did that technically I mean now that that event is over regigigas will appear in EAX raid so you won't have to require to do those said you don't need those said Reggie's to do that but the overall quest did did provide some flexibility so step one what what will said of it was it was evolved seven rock pokémon catch seven rock pokémon right yep and then it was catch either a Reggie rock out regice or a reggie steel if will would have done that last part quest to was catch seven steel pokémon or seven ice pokémon evolve seven eyes Pokemon and then again catch a Regirock a reggie ice regice or a reggie steel as you can guess number three is catch seven steel evolved seven steel and then catch a regice Reggie steel or Regirock witches so all in all you had to catch you had to do and complete and catch three Pokemon firm raids but it was nice in the sense that oh like I keep seeing reg I sent but I really need a Reggie Steele the final quest was the take a picture of all three of them so even though you you could do three regice the final quest required you to take a picture of a regice then a reggie steel then a reggie rock and then regigigas will show up so I thought like overall the the quest was good if you're a hardcore player of the game you probably could have evolved seven rock pokémon seven steal pokémon and seven nice Pokemon right away if you were not a hardcore player you would have spent a little more time catching those fields or catching those airons or catching those geodude's and they were plentiful but you know you have to catch with pin app you know four or five evolve one catch another four or five evolve one so it was pretty easy and I think well paced for somebody who maybe doesn't play pokemon go a lot but also not like annoying to the aspect of you know maybe a hardcore player who probably didn't really care about the quest line they just more so wanted the the rewards I suppose I mean I wanted the rewards but they're variable yeah but also I can like in the future do this right it's yeah yeah I'm away from me just because I'm out of the time the only requirement for the time was like that you buy the pass during that time yes so yeah you know down the line we will see no shortage of read the Reggie's coming back and being recycled I think though for the $8 I think so I guess so for the $8 I would say it was worth it I went to a brand new place that I've never played Pokemon go which can always go either very good or very poorly I would say what neither I would say wasn't the best place to play it wasn't the worst place to play in Milwaukee there wasn't a good place outside that would have raids and stops that didn't require me walking around in 34 degree weather Fahrenheit a couple things that they did I think I have the expectation and I think a lot of people also had the expectation that this would feel like a community day and what I mean by that is that there will be increased number of spawns of the Pokemon they said they were going to feature which would have been like Geodude Erin spheal and they talked about Skarmory being finally shiny and that when you pay the $7.99 you'll get your 10 rate passes you'll get your pose you'll get your regigigas you'll get special quest and there will be more raids for everyone to do not specifically to pass holders the only thing that pass holder is getting besides the free raid passes in the pose and the metal and the regigigas guarantee but what's the pose I don't know it look kind of looks like you're flossing it's not particularly good oh I'm glad it it paid back for that then the the thing that the pass holders were specifically getting was unique quest and those new knee quests were you know battle a friend trade with a friend add a new friend or complete a raid and when you did that you would either got like an Aerodactyl a Skarmory chuckle or something else that could be shiny or sought-after the ball I went to had about 19 stops so that was nineteen chances I guess of getting a shiny Skarmory spoiler I didn't get one and there were seven gems there although one seemed to be e.x blocked so it was never popping up a gym but what was nice is instead of these being tier five tier v raids they ended up being tier fours and the instead of having like a you know 230 or whatever the default timer is for a tier 5 they had a 300 second timer so it was very easy to have three people at minimum be able to do these and kind of move on to the next was nice and what was really cool is once you completed it about 20 minutes after that rate was complete another raid would start queuing up again and they would have 15 minute timers not 45 minute timers you complete a raid that raid finally expires about 20 minutes later a 15 timer pops so it was very easy once you got to one end of the mall being like oh and nine minutes we're gonna be able to do another Regirock over here so we'll just walk back I think there was some disappointment that this wasn't a community today as in your I like there were no special shininess for for like you didn't get it increased shininess for swine up or Geodude which I think did bum out people so instead of feeling like a community today it almost felt like one of those raid hours like the Gengar or the Articuno or the laughter it felt like that but instead of you know you doing a random moving on that raid will reap Appa get in a little bit so I think there was some expect to and to be fair to be completely fair in antic never said there was going to be increased Chinese or anything like that or increased spawns for ticket holders they did say there would be an increased amount of raids and they did deliver on this so I don't know if this falls into the Department of people setting their own expectations and being disappointed by that as you know paying $7 $7.99 for what I consider it to be like a raid a like Lapras or Articuno or Gengar the difference is instead of being three hours it was eight hours and a lot of people vocally said they wish these days were longer because they might not they might be at work during the three hour period so I think it did accomplish that and I guess it bone added on bonus quests that you could do to get a chance for a shiny Skarmory but it didn't feel like a go fest it did not feel like a safari zone and it did not feel like a community today the closest thing I could say that it felt to was like the Lapras Gengar Articuno thing that for the most part people seem to like those but overall long story short too long didn't read $8.00 to me is nothing because when I get a meal at five guys or at Burger King like that is usually about nine to eleven dollars I felt like I walked away with some enjoyment of what I did I would have done more than ten raids anyways so I got ten passes for $8 I got a free pose which normally is five dollars I guess I got a medal which means literally nothing but it was cool to look at I suppose and I thought the you know the I thought the question was fun I thought like doing the like things in a row even though it took me 90 minutes or so I thought it was fun I liked it was the good reason to get out of the house and play pokemon go and walk away with a regigigas so I don't really feel burned but at the same time I if you didn't do it I don't feel like you missed anything so if you partially did it you didn't miss anything yeah so it's like hard to recommend would I like pay for another event in the future yeah probably because I like I said I don't think I don't think they like screwed me on cost but at the same time I didn't think it was particularly exciting I think what we'll learn from this just like the first time they did what was that it was like the it was it was Phoebus everyone hated Phoebus and then they made it better what client Pro came out I would only assume that they're going to probably make it a little bit better I don't know what that is and I think that's the important talking point I eat because if if people were expecting like SHINee rates to be boosted because they paid $8 at what line are we drawing for knee antic to charge us to increase our luck like a shiny charm but I guess you could argue that for go fast but at this yeah yeah there's a level of value that they have to wait right like the fact that you even though it was you know eight hours that day and you didn't have to do all eight I only did six I think there is sort of like was I getting the value out of spending that money because like you can say well I would have spent that money on food but you need to you need food like nobody's buying and like there is a level of okay what what did I get $8 worth of value out of this event and I think that's gonna be very I think that will vary a lot between each person obviously like if they saw it but I think people who thought oh this should be like a regular community day and didn't get that like that wouldn't have been a hard thing to do for $8 for a large event that sort of celebrated the reggie's so I get that a little bit like although I would I don't know what a better value looks like like I don't know what that is so here's what I was thinking actually because I I kind of saw this go around there was the I can't remember was physically called it was like the welcome back thing that they did the questline I might actually still have it active here it was called you had the one who like jumpstart peep jumpstart research so the jumpstart research was do you know help people get back to the Pokemon go give them a lot of Stardust give them some candy you know let them get like a dragon knight pretty easily that quest line guaranteed you a free shiny Eevee there I think we've said this about community days and stuff before where some people who are like this event was amazing because I got X amount of Chinese or this event sucked because I didn't get any Chinese a lot of people judge their their their days like that which I mean is your everyone has a different enjoyment in Pokemon go but if the questline maybe maybe guaranteed you a shiny Skarmory I think people probably would have walked away pretty positive and before anyone was like well they shouldn't be handing out free Chinese why they yeah they did like why do they do it all the time for the main series game right now you can go to Game Stop and get a shiny Lu Nala or so Gallio who thanks for the reminder Gregg when are we going I don't know when you want to go and I don't I don't really see it as paying for I mean I guess you could say like you're paying for a shiny but you're paying for an event is we're just sort of be like what my line is I don't want to pay for a shiny it's like but like if you're paying seven dollars just for the shiny isn't that more like on you instead of like the thing there are they're offering you an experience and experiences cost money you could pay seven dollars to go to a water park or you could sit in your bathtub and watch turn turn on scary water parks are you going to Steve must be $20 to go to the zoo last night and look at pumpkins Steve's backyard waterpark seven bucks come on down it's a slip and slide it's November I had a pilot dig a hole in my backyard I've put a waterslide back there why did it go up a dollar yeah eight bucks enough shiny guaranteed to be on street okay here we go here we go come Dusty's backyard barbecue I got out serve you up some yard barbecue and slip and slide yes sir you have something ribs ribs back I think the McRib is back if anything from this podcast one go to gamestop get yourself a shiny so go Leo and I know a bad Chinese go ahead and stop at McDonald's get your McRib and then come my way she's man bye Steve's $7.00 waterparks dude super sketch $7.00 water by you insurance I it's like the same argument as the pokeball Plus where some people see that as a $50 Moo and I don't agree with those people because one there's multiple ways to get in you and there has been for 20-some years heck if for whatever reason if you still had my Pokemon ranch on your Nintendo Wii sitting in your parents basement get yourself a limited amounts of news because that because it just literally spits out unlimited muse so if you're looking at the pokeball plus and you're saying I'm paying $50 for mu-1 there's other ways to get me there will always be more ways to get Mew in the future but you're paying for a controller that works like a joy con and joy comes with $40 you're paying for something that also has the compatibility of a pokeball plus or a Pokemon Pokemon go Plus which is 35 and you're getting a mu and you're getting a device that works with two Pokemon games let's go Eevee and let's go Pikachu and sword and shield that when you put a Pokemon on set device it will give you rewards into your game so for me I never see I know I poke a walker and the best part it's a polka Walker so I've never saw that as English I never saw that as a $50 mu I saw that as a controller and a pokeball plus with added features so you could look at an event like the regigigas event and if they offered a free shiny you would have some people look at that as a $7 shiny but I would look at it as unexperienced that I'm doing with friends where I'm getting regigigas and I am doing a quest line and I am getting Stardust and I am getting experience and I'm getting I am doing something I guess I don't know I just don't I think that like offering a shiny isn't outside of what has been offered in both Pokemon go and the main series stuff I don't know if that makes it a better value or more enticing it was the first time they did this so there's plenty of room for improvement right as is I don't think I wasted my money but I mean some people might feel like they they did I thought it was okay though I didn't think it was great I just thought it was like okay sure we did it it was something to do on a Saturday afternoon safer than your water park a straight answer so the one thing if if like Niantic came to me and said will anderson we noticed that you spent the $8 and you didn't even get past the first step what what could we do to improve the experience for you so that you would have it gotten more out of it I would say please offer like even if you have to offer two tickets right offer one ticket for people who like to do raids and do the social aspects of Pokemon go and then offer another ticket that's like you can completely do this solo and maybe make it harder or something like you have to catch more Pokemon or do something like that but give me an option that does not involve raids because I just the I don't have the time and effort for it not I mean misanthropic reasons aside for people who are in rural areas who don't have access to raids it would be nice to have that option for them to participate so I support the idea for that reason like that you know it's hard for people who live in sparse areas are on salami island who don't have access to full race but you know it's like I have tremendous compassion now for those people because like in DC I could walk from my house I could do a 1.5 mile walk just around my neighborhood and hit 20 pokey stops I took a 6 mile walk yesterday from my house through st. Paul in back and I didn't even hit 10 you know I say Paul or find and gentle folk yeah but they feel bad for you because you're literally 15 minutes away from the best place to play pokemon go indoors in the entire world and you're on the light rail like I mean maybe it's true that like Disney World is a better place to play pokemon go pensive but that's outside in the hot Sun I'm just saying I am technically in a city of a similar size to DC but even here there are not as many pokey stops as there are in DC so for somebody who's in a rural area I can imagine it's even worse yes this event was nice though that in you know instead of like the Gengar a day you do that one gang guard now that gym is expired for the rest of the three hours in this case in a couple minutes after the raid is complete it's going to spawn another raid so for people in rural areas as long as your gym wasn't an e^x gym that was getting blocked because of how es gyms block out for the entire day you probably would have seen six to eight raids in the eight hours at that same gym pop over and over and over again which in that case that you just stand around it and wait for the next yeah and I wish I had known that because there's actually a gym that you can reach if you just stand in the right corner of my building yes true but I mean I'm not like I wasn't super super disappointed but there's there is a high ceiling of improvement that Nanta can hit with future events of these and I think we said like two three weeks ago that we we ultimately think that these will kind of replace Pokemon go fest in the in the iteration of this weekend not even close and I still think we'll probably get more Pokemon go fest into 2020 but I think once they find the right balance of what they want a player to do for how long for how much I think that ultimately this will make more money than a go fest will ever do for them which is not particularly good for us but I know they listen to what people do or do not want in Pokemon go [Music] Hey hello hi how are you SP J here normally there's a musical break but of course it is the beginning of the month which means that I take a couple seconds of this episode please tell you that this is my full-time job podcasting and creating content on Twitch or how I pay my bills that's not what it used to be but I've been doing it for about two years now actually - you're strong so I'm able to do that because of listeners who support on patreon I know that most podcasts have some sort of patron spiel shree shree just feel like the pokemon that evolves into walrein that there's a middle evolution in there somewhere anyways we tried not to do we try not to promote the patreon too much I can get annoying so I try to do just a little bit of a thing the first of the month but revamped I will slightly change some of the patreon rewards so if you haven't checked it out in the past six months might be a good idea to check it out but if you're curious what it is patreon is a website that you can sign up for and you can set it for like one dollar a month or two dollars a month or five dollars a month and then that money helps support me but for $2 a month you get access to our slack community which has a ton of active people very nice I've been told they tell me to get they yell at me they say hey you need to promote the slack more because everyone here is really nice and really great so if you're looking for trainers especially with pokemon sword and Pokemon shield coming up that you want to trade with battle with talk with laughs with cry with you might consider checking out the patreon is e dot Cash or the long way patreon.com slash it's super effective or the easy way just looking in your show notes in your podcast app and then clicking the little button that says support on patreon all three of those ways work and it's a pretty easy way to support the show if you want to support at a higher tier you can get out my Pokemon go friendslist if that's something important to you you can get a shout out at the end of the episode again if that's something important to you if you like receiving physical mail I send out seasonal postcards in the spring fall summer winter I usually includes stickers and stuff with that tons of rewards for different ways if you want to support if you can't afford to that's something I'd be financially you're not at not in the market for or maybe you just don't want to totally cool the fact that you're listening to this episode is is support as well that's my schpeel steel steel that's

super effective but enjoy the episode [Music] and we are back from our break we are here with real break-in Nate how are you man I'm doing good it's I'm a little nervous to be on the podcast because I'm a big fan and so I don't want to make a fool of myself well thank you I appreciate it this is this is funny cuz we've been trying to plan this for since Pokemon go fest I think at this point yeah which was what that was when was Pokemon go past that end of early August central end of July I can't remember exam two and weird weird story real fast of how we met there I was with super duper Danny another Pokemon content creator and she had tweeted out that she was there and and then I started to like freak out a little bit because I was like oh my god how did how does he know you how does he know you and you were talking about like meeting up and I'm like oh my god Danny you have to reply back like right now we have to go meet up with him because I wanted to meet you really really bad yeah I do I do remember this I remember how I like discovered Danny either but yeah well it's a small world sometimes right right that's crazy that's crazy and I and she could never mentioned that she had kind of like new you so it was just a very spur of the moment and I was like hardcore listening to your podcast though but yeah here we are here we are for for my listeners who are you I guess I your name is Nate obviously in your name of your YouTube channel but who are you for listeners I mean that's a good question because I'm still trying to figure out who I am but I go by real breaking Nate on YouTube and all the social media platforms but I do I do Pokemon content and I mix it with like my family life and just kind of what's going on in my world so I guess most people would consider me a Pokemon channel but I just kind of consider myself more of just kind of like um I don't know just like a vlogger that sense yeah but but there's Pokemon in it yeah but obviously I mean if the underlying and the undertone is it's a Pokemon channel but it's a very unique take of including like my wife and my dog in the channel and just like you know what's going on in our lives like that and then there's Pokemon as well so you know in it it's it's my full-time and my full-time I hate calling it a job because I doesn't feel like a job to me but it is my full-time job technically okay okay before we kind of get to the I guess the job part of things yeah why specifically like Pokemon I'm assuming there was like one point in your life where Pokemon grabbed your attention whether that was like the TCG or the anime or the video game or the merchandise it's really just the whole so I've always been a collector of just things in general so I've always collected something in my life I remember my parents used to take we used to go on the weekends to antique stores all the time and I absolutely hated it and in order to enjoy it I started to collect things from antique stores so I've just always been a collector mindset and then when Pokemon came about in the 90s the whole motto is got to collect them all you know gotta catch them all and got to collect everything so that really like spoke to me like a whole new level like the whole motto is you know you've got to collect everything so I've been a fan since the 90s since it first came out and yeah I know I played I played red and blue when it first came out I loved it I loved the video games but there's just something about the card game that just I have no idea just makes me extremely extremely happy like there's no extravagant answer behind it but the card game just makes me so happy because every time you open up a booster pack it's just like this a big mystery like what is inside this booster pack is gonna be something really really good or is it something that I've pulled you know ten times now I don't know there's just I just it makes me happy that's just there's no big answer to it you know I'm not trying to you know give you something some crazy extravagant answer it's just it makes me happy sure did you also like suffer the same thing as most ninety kids where you like fell out of Pokemon for like two or three years and then came back oh I would be lying if I said I didn't I didn't completely fall out you know you kind of hit that face to where you start to I mean obviously you're growing up as as a person and you know you're discovering new things you're trying to figure out who you are I think I was in I think I was in 4th or 5th grade when Pokemon hit the United States and it's so kinda as you start to grow up you know you start to learn about other things and you get interested in other things and Pokemon wasn't as prominent in my life but it was I was still a fan of it I was still buying stuff and things like that but I did have that period where it was like you know I was getting in other things like I just gotten into wrestling - so I was watching on wrestling and buying wrestling stuff but that was wrestling TCG cards did you play that game no no no no I didn't I I wanted them though cuz the wrestling came out yeah wrestling was like my thing after Pokemon for a hot minute and so the natural transition was like I had pokemon cards and there's like these wrestling cards at Target but my parents would never get them for me I think it was just kind of like the 90s thing you know I mean so like you're a kid and you just kind of grab on to whatever's popular at the time I feel like Pokemon was popular and then wrestling had its big boom in the late 90s so everybody was into wrestling and and then I I think at the end of the day you kind of circle back around to what really makes you happy and at the end of the day you know years later it's still Pokemon that's making me happy and stuck around yeah wrestling fan not so much but I mean I still am but not as hardcore as it was totally from Pokemon too you know living your life and then coming back to Pokemon was that also the same time you decided to get into content creation or was that like totally different because for me specifically I felt out of Pokemon like most people did in like middle school and maybe like the start of high school and then I got back in with diamond and pearl and then it wasn't until our cold soul silverware I thought to myself like I want to make content because there's a lack of one of my case podcast there was there was a four or five podcast in iTunes and and three of them haven't didn't post an episode for you know years and then two of them they did post episodes but it was like once a month and I was like I need like a weekly show I'm gonna make it myself consistency is key so was that was that for you like you circled back to Pokemon and then you were like I want to feel some void or was it like I'm already making content and I want to add Pokemon to it it was kind of a weird a weird journey for me so that night I just I had gotten like hardcore back into Pokemon and not with the expectation of making content out of it I got into content creating because I was a kind of a long story but I was a manager at American Eagle and I went in one day and I was just I was fed up working there I was fed up like working and not know working in general working there I was just fed up with it and I was tired of like people telling me what to do and things like that I'm not in a rebel sense but just you know in a working sense and so I went in one day and I had my keys and I just I threw him on the table and said I quit I'm gonna go be a youtuber and I tried that for a while and it didn't work okay and what you're telling me every youtubers dream of I want to be a youtuber sometimes doesn't work yeah it's crazy right crazy and so I I spent a year trying to create content and kind of figuring out my voice and it just didn't it didn't work and you know I'm sure as you have realized at times creating content like you know I I need some money I'd better go find a job yeah you know because I just gotten it was so it the thing as I had quit my job at American Eagle two months before getting married so that was a big big issue yeah if you need a way to throw out money very quickly right you get married and it'll suck all your money exactly exactly so that was a little worrisome but we still got married obviously but I went and got a job at a local doughnut shop in my town a small town of like no more than six thousand people a donut shop had went and I'd opened up and went and applied and started started essentially just making donuts and dipping Donuts into icing and they knew I had a passion for creating content so they let me be in charge of their of their social media and their marketing that kind of reignited my passion for content creating weirdly enough and so I started creating content again and I was creating a lot of content on Instagram more than I wasn't anything else and I started making Pokemon post on Instagram and people were like really enjoying them and I was like this is this is so crazy like I didn't know there was this huge online community of people that enjoyed Pokemon and just and sharing their passion with other people and then I kind of transitioned it over to youtube and I kind of found my voice weirdly enough I found my voice of just being myself I think when people start to create content they always think like they have to be some certain way and I just started being myself and just started being like my wacky trying to be funny at least I think I'm funny trying to just you just have a good time and laugh and smile and just make people's day brighter bring a smile to their face and and it worked I guess it's it's weird it's weird to think that just being yourself and sharing your passion can lead to something like this yeah how long ago was that the Instagram from Donuts to Instagram Donuts oh that's a book right there if I write a book that's the title so it would have been like late 2016 early 2017 okay in the period yeah that seems right that seems like where Instagram really kind of blew up 2016 ish it was one of those platforms like oh that's just where the kids are nobody else is on there and then look at it now it's huge yeah which by the way tick tock is gonna be the same way I'm saying it right now but and then I just transitioned everything over or I didn't transition it I just started doing stuff expanding it to YouTube and it just it started like blew up one day it literally like I don't I didn't have some sort of like secret game plan or something like that it just literally blew up and August of 2017 I quit my full-time job with the donut shop and was like hey if I'm going to if I'm serious about this I have to quit this job and I have to go into content creating I have to jump into the pool essentially like I can't dip my toes I have to jump in and it was a big leap of faith it's one of the scariest things I ever did my entire life was to quit a full-time job to believe in myself to do content grading and it's still working to this day so fingers crossed ago in that way well I don't think the Pokemon company is gonna stop making TCG cards anytime soon sign oh yeah I always tell people like I feel I feel like Pokemon is safe because a lot of times people always ask me like what are you gonna do when when Pokemon goes away I'm like I don't ever see that happening III think Pokemon is here to stay and I think a lot of my a lot of I don't like calling it a fan base because I can save everybody friends so I'll say fan base are friends but I think a lot of people come to the channel to just enjoy our time together they enjoy the Pokemon stuff there but they enjoy the time together because I I talk about my anxiety depression just going through life situations so I think people really really enjoy that so if Pokemon ever did go away I wouldn't be too concerned I mean I'd be concerned personally because I am absolutely a little too obsessed with Pokemon but as far as content creating I don't think I'd be crazy concerned yeah I was gonna say if not Pokemon like what else would you be doing but it sounds like you've probably pretty outright at doing social media for any kind of company I I feel like I would I think if to say if Pokemon ever stopped let's say it stopped tomorrow for some weird reason and I think obviously I would have a little bit of trouble with the transition but I love just positive thinking and and just kind of like motivational talk so I feel like I could do something motivation speaking on on YouTube alright alright or just or just sharing my life in general I don't know it's something along those lines but I feel like I feel like my fan base would enjoy that so we have a new game coming out we're sneaking this interview in like less than two weeks before pokemon sword and pokemon shield come out I'm sure you're very excited for that maybe maybe for the video games but obviously they're coming with the the TCG - yeah I mean obviously you come to my channel you see a lot of TCG stuff but I love anything that Pokemon releases so I get I get hyped about everything that they release I'm a total fanboy I can't help it that's who I am and I'm not everything that they release I enjoy but the initial phase of them releasing it I get excited so I am 100% hyped for a sword and shield was there a new Pokemon they've shown that caught your attention oh it's surfaced are you kidding me alright good you cannot like surface it's true it's I feel like it's long overdue for far-fetched to have some some evolution form it's it's it's one of those Pokemon that's like I don't know I think it's kind of secretly one of everybody's favorite Pokemon far-fetched but nobody wants to admit it I've said this before on the show or or what not but I feel like far-fetched has always been pretty popular but like I don't think anyone has like a secret popularity for like the love of qwilfish I don't think anyone's like like rolling up to a bar and pulling up their sleeve and showing off like a qwilfish tattoo I just don't think don't think that person exists up there but for far-fetched I think it does exist are you all a hundred percent I am sure I'm sure with a couple of quick google searches you can find some real hardcore far-fetched fans I'm sure so that's what I'm excited about right now is Sir fetched but I'm I'm just waiting for that gallery' inversion of Psyduck Hilarion Psyduck yes there's gotta be one right house there not one at this point yes that looks pretty popular alright and I feel like and that's also the downfall to I feel like it's so popular that they won't want to mess with it hmm just kind of like how we had the Aloha and Raichu but we didn't have a little and Pikachu right I can't read you don't mess with with like the main players you just put a pad on Pikachu and call it a day exactly and I feel like site that's the main player so they might not mess with it I can see you might be a Glary and Golduck but no site ugh okay okay I gotta ask although like I'm Shh I feel like I feel like TCG players have a different mindset with Pokemon altogether and not to harp on the TCG stuff but how do you feel about the national next thing that happened oh I don't care that's my that's my thing too and I think coming from a TCG standpoint and this is why I it doesn't bother me because whenever and whenever a new TCG set is released so we just have cosmic eclipsed by the time this podcast up is a cosmic eclipse will be released yeah it's the biggest set in Pokemon Pokemon history and whenever they release a new set not every Pokemon is in that set for me it makes sense to not have every Pokemon in the videogame as well it gives a uniqueness to the game almost by not putting every Pokemon in the game so then next time around when whatever is after sword and shield maybe we'll be excited about like oh what pokemon are they gonna put in there well they finally qwilfish is coming actually I think her fish isn't certain she but I mean that's kind of my standpoint I mean and that's and that's how the TCG has always been when we get the base set back in the 90s not every Pokemon from the 151 was in the base set it seems like a weird complaint but also at the same time I'm not one to judge someone of their preference I totally understand who someone is upset that not every Pokemon is in there but for me personally it doesn't bother me in the last 20-some years of Pokemon was there was there a game or even maybe a movie that was kind of like a huge disappointment for you something you you look forward to like let's say you were super excited for Magikarp jump it was gonna be your game of 2018 then it ended up being a flop no pun intended although I don't think anyone was ever upset with magikarps don't think he was pretty good I actually did a video on magic herb jump a long time ago that was 2017 wasn't it 17 yeah yeah yeah 17 yeah I think 2017 that my game play that was very short-lived I think I played that for like a week and then I was like okay I kind of get it like I felt like I was just kind of kept doing the same thing over and over again but it was a neat cute little game I mean that's and that's actually a hard question to look back on and think what what was a disappointment as you're thinking I could say that I was pretty disappointed with Crimson Invasion that entire release was oh the the that you're talking TCG or and anything I'm just I just know like well Pokemon duel was a huge bummer to me yes crimson invasion was a pretty big letdown crimson invasion is a little bit of a rough set the power of us I can't stand that movie is I was super hyped for it but man that movie didn't didn't do it for me I would okay here this is this might be a weird one but I think and this is over the span of year so this is not something specific I think I get a little disappointed with how little hype there is for when they do is theatrical releases okay yeah so I there because they make a lot of great movies even even the ones that are not so great are still great in a sense and I feel like they just don't hype them enough I know in Japan they do yeah like when it makes it to the rest of the world like there's just not enough hype for it so I think that would be one of my my biggest I don't want to say complaints or just let downs or disappointments it's I said I feel like every year when we get a movie I'm like okay this is the year where they're really gonna like hype it up and they'll give out a card when you go to see the movie or something like that and then they hardly ever do yeah Japan really treats movie releases like like a game release almost over there there's right yeah and now and now what there's a chance we're not getting the the Mewtwo movie for this year yeah I mean I think it's pretty clear that we're not getting me to at the Mewtwo movie at all this year maybe next year but maybe not at all do you think it maybe has something to do with detective Pikachu coming out this year they don't want two things in the theatre Pokemon this year I don't specifically know so I we actually talked about this a little bit last week and then somebody tweeted I apologize can't remember their name somebody tweeted where the source was and it was uh it was a comic book calm article but specifically it was it was somebody tweeting at Fath fathom events asking if the Mewtwo movie was coming out and they said that they didn't hear anything from the Pokemon company and they weren't handling any promotion or release for that movie as far as they knew so I guess you can elating you can only take so much from a tweet but fan fathom was the ones that did the power of us and I choose you and what the last I can't remember what movie was before I choose you that was like theater bound I know the black and white Victini movies were in theaters there's a very big time between that movie and I choose you I I think honestly I could probably see them just doing like a TV release of it yeah or they're on Disney XD now I think yeah yeah I could totally see them just doing just like throwing it up on Disney XD before I wonder if we'll get the anime this year in the United States for sword and shield or if they'll hold out because I don't think they're estimated to finish the u.s. anime until like April yeah so maybe I don't know maybe they use that as a premiere to the sword and shield anime I have no idea so like hey watch them YouTube movie right before the premiere in the episode premiere episode of Sauron shield I don't know it's interesting it's interesting how pokemons mind work yeah I feel like sometimes they they drop the ball with specific things like how I'll like for Pokemon day they they don't do like a distribution for us which I've complained about before like if you're going to celebrate in February is it February 27th I think yeah you have you have people with all these games and you're doing invents and Pokemon go but why are we not getting something for let's go like just give us a big leap up like it doesn't matter just give us something to commemorate that specific day I think Pokemon is huge in in the United States and Canada and in any part of the world honestly it's it's huge here so yeah I'm always puzzled that the that we don't go out a little bit more go all out so it's it's very interesting the the choices but I mean they know what they're doing the the brands been around this long yeah I'm not one to I'm not one to complain you did a YouTube video about this I think I saw this on your Instagram and I can I saw it I saw it when we first started talking but you have the legendary Pokemon snap thing from blockbuster Pokemon snap machine I don't know what the actual like the name of it is come on snap station snap station there you go yeah yeah I think there was one at every blockbuster mm-hmm I'm not sure how many blockbusters at one point exist I think they were also from what I've heard I haven't researched it too much I'm working on it like in-depth video of the snap station for the future and I haven't got to this point yet but I think in like Canada they were actually in McDonald's oh really I'm not 100% sure on that but some people have been saying that they they remember going to McDonald's and then seeing it okay so I thought it might have been a Canada thing but you have one in your house yeah it's actually sitting behind me right now I know I am assuming it works yeah 100% working condition I just I have a brand new studio that I'm currently working on and it's not been revealed at the time as we're recording this but once the podcast is out it'll be revealed so I have a snap station in my background and then on the other side which I have not shown at all and nobody knows that I have is a I don't know if you ever remember these but it's a Pokemon Pokemon catch arcade machine it's this huge arcade machine where these balls drop down and you have to throw my lisagreen hey no it's not it's like an arcade machine Oh weird like when I was in Japan there was a there was like an arcade machine where all these like little rubber balls would fall down and then you would throw them at a screen but I guess the screen had sensors in it so like a Pikachu would pop up you throw it and then you'd catch it and then if you got a high enough score it would actually print you out a card a collectible card with a QR code on that's that's way too advanced this right here this machine was from 2001 so back in back in that era and it has Veronica Taylor's voice on it voicing Ash and it's so it's just huge arcade machine so I have arcade machine on one side and the Pokemon snap station on the other side yes the Pokemon snap station is in 100% working condition is still prints out the stickers I think there's there's only like one thing missing to it and it's a little rubber keychain that went with the key that I don't have but other than that it works perfectly fine and prints out stickers and how did you acquire said snap station did you find like an abandoned Blockbuster that you like kicked down the door and dragged it out that's a YouTube video right there know it I had been its so I have like a like a most wanted list of Pokemon items that I just absolutely love and a lot of the items on the list are very just like obscure weird type of items i-i'll of I love a good bass set Charizard in my life but I really love these obscure items and so I've been searching for one for the longest time and let me tell you Facebook market place is a goldmine I have been I've been watching it I've been watching Facebook Marketplace hardcore and then literally on a Sunday at 4:00 p.m. one had popped up in Ohio I'm an Indiana and one popped up in Ohio it was like four hours away and I immediately messaged a guy I'm like all right I will pay you in cash I will come get it right now this moment it was a very spur-of-the-moment type of thing and he was down for it and I went there my wife went with me and she had to be at work in the morning at 8 a.m. and she was she was a trooper she was the real trooper of that trip going on a last-minute trip essentially eight hours all together to get this pokemon snap station she had to be at work at 8:00 a.m. we left it I think for Pete or 4:30 p.m. so do you know where he got it was he like an X blockbuster employee he told me that he got it from one in Philadelphia who had bought it from a blockbuster store okay so um including Blockbuster I would be the fourth owner of it but it's in really really good condition I have extra ink I have extra paper extra cards that go with it as well but it was really it was crazy and so like I went over there and the guy was just a collector of video game stuff just even if he wasn't a fan of that brand video game he just collected video game stuff in general and he was like hey you want to come and see my video game stuff in my basement I'm like mmm sure stranger yeah why not so he went into his basement and he just had loads and loads of just video game stuff and there was just like random Pokemon stuff on the wall and then I just started throwing prices out at him I was like I gotta have it what do you want for this what do you want for this so I essentially went for the Pokemon snap station and then left with a bunch of other things Wow I'm sure he was probably very happy right he wasn't a huge pokemon fan so it was okay he didn't really mind letting them go but like I left with a box of unopened Pokemon pop-tarts and a box of unopened Pokemon fruit roll-ups I don't know if you remember those two I do yeah and those things are like I'm my most wanted list I'm sorry sure there was like Pokemon SpaghettiOs at one point there was that's really hard to find oh right that's on my list that's the gem right there it is it's one of the gyms I'm really into collecting like the old Pokemon food food merchandise so like remember a goes yes yes so like they had Pokemon Eggos and that's extremely hard to find okay all right so so you're saying SpaghettiOs above like the pop-tarts above the cereal above the the fruit roll-ups yes spaghetti SpaghettiOs definitely above all of that but Eggos and popsicles I think are the top one oh well as popsicles be you you have your freezer go bad all of us and you well maybe not necessarily having the popsicles with it but the box okay the Box just yeah the frozen items you can't really can't really keep around but the box essentially okay is what I'm asking so come on out there house box of Pikachu popsicles do you remember those I don't remember I remember the a goes I'm pretty sure I ate the egg goes if it was any kind of processed food with Pokemon on it my parents and my parents had a coupon we would have gotten it the ninety was very wild when I came to food what are you looking forward to for 20 Tony whether that's career-wise or Pokemon wise or anything could be could be just anything in general I am looking forward to hopefully not being so anxious about everything I know that sounds weird but I have I have extreme anxiety about everything that I do and life in general and so my personal goal is to not be so anxious about everything but if we're talking on maybe the sense of Pokemon I just I I just hope that they start expanding more I know that sounds weird because they're all over the world but I feel like there's so much more that they can expand upon and I feel like 2020 is the year for that okay all right because there's a the rumor right now is that with the Pokemon TCG Japan's always been like a set ahead of us so they have the cards before we do but the rumor now is that that we're gonna be we're gonna be synced together and that they're gonna be releasing together at the same time yeah Japan is at an advantage I guess for having cards earlier but also at a disadvantage because they have to always play backwards when it comes to like world tournaments yeah exactly and I think Pokemon is looking to fix that by having the same release dates of everything cuz now as of once cosmic eclipse comes out we will 100% be caught up to what's released in Japan see my my dream is for them to finally redo the backs of the cards because they're awful I know that I know that would drive a million people crazy and it would ruin expand it and that would ruin a legacy and all this stuff but just start fresh get new backs of cards for everyone because Japan still has different backs than everyone else right yeah and Japan at one point did change their backs yeah Alton they did so unify the format get new backs of cards for everyone and then update that gosh awful Pokemon Trading Card Game online app because it's still stuck in like 2008 with that wooden background that I I hate but there was also rumors that a different company is working on a new TCG app for Pokemon that'll be good there was a rumor that the people who made the Magic the Gathering online TCG app is currently working on the Pokemon one but I I can't narrow down like a reliable source on that just I mean so if they change the backs of the cards would you want them to change change it to what it looks like in Japan or just completely change both Japan and the rest of the world's cards back I actually like Japan's card backs I think they're pretty clean although they are missing here every one right in front of me well first off the the button is on the right part of the pokeball yeah the buttons on the red part that's a white heart but Japan has uh it's missing ferry and steel and dark on the back I guess technically okay yeah but otherwise it has the other symbols but I don't know I don't mind the Japan back as it is now the original Japan pact was kind of pretty awful I remember that I was always thought that was a weird one for some reason I don't know I kind of like I kind of like the Halden on Japan card backs look there's just something nostalgic about it because like you can look at the back of the car and it's the same in the 90s is it hell yeah maybe I just want to forget everything like you know if people are coming back into you know maybe they're getting back into Pokemon they look at that card back and they're just like ah I'm home I'm finally back home yeah that's true there's that like rush of nostalgia and stuff when they hit that also just big so is in Japan also doesn't have certain cards as us like they don't have reverse Hallows there yeah yeah so we we have and we have some things that that they don't have but it would be nice to just all be on sync like the entire world be one be on sync together with the Pokemon TCG well speaking of being on sync I should probably let you go but where can our listeners find you that was thinking part that was the transits that transition but that was the transition I appreciate that transition I think you did a phenomenal job you can find me on youtube real breaking Nate youtube.com slash real breaking Nate any social media platforms Instagram Twitter Facebook I who uses Facebook still though Instagram and tik-tok are the things that I tend to use

convention appearances as well awesome well Nate it was a pleasure to talk to you thank you get thank you for being on Oh No thank you this was like this was literally a huge honor when you had texted me and was like hey do you want to be on the podcast I literally was freaking out I was fangirling I rushed to my wife I was like oh my god oh my god I'm gonna be on I'm gonna be on and so hopefully I didn't sound too much like a fool but no I was great and that's who I am just being myself all right when we when we get back we're gonna do our question of the week and our Pokemon of the week so we will see you after the break [Music] Hey [Music] [Music] solve them we have more news but we'll save it for next week we'll hit us oh wait Greg question of the week all right here we go to ask a question pokemon questions let's hear that question the question of the we said uh did Britney scare you with the know with how good hers was last week no no oh sorry we haven't that album showed up on my iPhone because I've been going through my music and like categorizing cuz this is new program there's a no program that I found again and it popped up again I'm like I have not listened to this in a long time what album is that to be a master Oh the reason why I totally forgot this news Gabe from our attic channel Genesis then real quick we'll talk about it more next week but just real quick heads up there is an official announcement from Nintendo versus Twitter there is a pokemon sword and shield event in tetris 99 you will be able to unlock a tetris pokemon theme for your tetris 99 game it will start on November 7th and will run to November 11th and if you participate and earn a hundred events you will unlock a special sword and shield theme which has sword and shield music in it I

lot of people do though okay that's Steve sure you that well I'll let you know I'll let you know okay so question of the week here with leek season four sword and shield what's everyone's favorite and least favorite vegetable all right favorite vegetable beets Greg Leatherman what how dare you steal my vegetable beets are my favorite has eaten before you did is our mushrooms our vegetable as well mushrooms are a fungus yeah but animal vegetable mineral they're vegetable now that's we're not playing to anyone questions I love beets so much and you know that I go like at the grocery store and I get those dehydrated I will give you because I will take Brussels sprouts I do love a real good process Brussels sprouts oh yes they're a vegetable that I not a you Steve have you never had like a like a roasted Brussels sprout they don't you know I've had a lot of vegetables and I hate almost all of them I don't know if I've had a Brussels sprout I think if I was to pick a favorite it might be carrot those no carrots are jus soggy it might be like a are you talking about carrot don't ya hear things fresh and crisp mmm celery carrots anymore I'll I just plant I put so I put celery above I put celery favorite vegetable cuz you can dip it in peanut butter heck yeah boy cream cheese I will say kale okay I do not like a kale ooh kale might beat me out for I don't like yeah I like I love carrots but I can't eat them anymore is seaweed a vegetable caris your soy issue is my carried issue now by the way oh boy so number one soy is a vegetable yes why beans wow it's a legume it's a legume peanuts aren't a vegetable they're a legume that is also true Katherine will do two questions here Katherine if you did not make Pokemon content would you still seek out leeks or not I didn't make Pokemon content for a long time and I did seek out leeks so the answer for me is yes but I seek I'm one of those like I seek them out very early on and then like that comes a point because I have a weird imaginary timeline and when we have crossed that line to X amount of weeks away from the game then I stop looking but I don't I don't seek out leeks where that there's a resumption in this question that I like I avoid leaks as much as possible I avoid spoilers as much as possible Steve do you see get leeks would you if you didn't make this podcast yeah yeah yeah I think so I've given the situation before where I did not care about any of the Marvel movies what was that Marvel movie that was like 18 hours long end game yeah and so when everyone was talking about it I've like read the Wikipedia synopsis and then after reading it I was like oh maybe I want to see this movie now now that I know the ending that brings up my complaint about you two saying you need a superhero expert on the show I have not read comics since the age of 14 and followed every movie to be disrespected like that are you still reading comics no could I get too expensive so I got to taxi Oh comics fandom yike yeah I would I would still sneak out weeks I like Pokemon too much too so it's a wait I guess in patience for the win will give us our Pokemon of the week all right so last week's Pokemon once again I was taking my Saturday morning walk and I was going through I had to clean out my Pokemon go Pokemon but I didn't want to do any Kanto ones because I had to transfer them until let's go so I could do all that biz that you have to do so I was going through Jojo and as I was going through Johto I discovered that after Pokemon number 224 there are two Pokemon that you would expect to be next to each other because of a particular holiday that they deal with but they are not next to each other and the second one of those is the first normal type pokémon in pokedex order that can learn the move calm mind who was that Pokemon it's Stantler gorebyss Stantler dude it's de corpus is not even normal type [Laughter] what is wrong with you let me call it the speak with your mother spoke to my mother before well now I have particular issues I need to bring up with her what do you what do you want to know is about Stantler it has a thick but he's got that booty Stantler maybe a combination of stag or stair and antlers probably staying an antler all right well but he said eyes in its horn yeah it's got a real bad green shiny I do not like the stainless shiny what about its shuffle shuffle icon on point so good yeah that's pretty good it's so crabby so it's like it's like over everything about you and it's extra set of eyes and thus antlers are like also over you so Sandler is found on route 36 which leads to violet City the in-game counterpart of Nara Japan a city where tame deer roam freely did you visit Nara when you were in Japan I didn't missed opportunity that's go meet some sailor if Irene and I can figure out a way to go to Japan next year I think it's it's on the list but I think it's south of Tokyo I think it's southwest but I do not have a tie game I got a nice jacket I got a map it's it's it's like below Osaka so okay if we were to go back to Tokyo it would probably be like not as many days in Tokyo and more days in like Kyoto and Osaka yeah I want to go to Kyoto places not all of them I want to go to Japan I'm in there me either and I have friends there oh boy I am in you too Oh Stanley yeah sorry Stantler so boring that we start talking about Japan the shade the German name for Sandler is real good but it don't speak German give us our Pokemon for next week all right ever since the black and white - Pokemon games I have maintained a living pokedex for those who are unfamiliar with the concept a living dex means that you owned one of every c'mom including an individual of each stage of evolution when let's go Pikachu and Eevee came out I no longer had a living Dex what I was having difficulty restoring my living Dex because the key Pokemon I needed was only available in pokemons go he could be transferred into the let's go games but it could not be obtained there I am a very passive Pokemon go player primarily playing with my pokeball Plus while I take my usual Saturday hike obtaining the necessary Pokemon could not be easily accomplished in this method and trust me I tried yesterday morning I decided to restore myself to living Dex status again seeing as I have both defeated the Elite Four and let's go Pikachu and also caught Mewtwo I have decided to complete the national dex in the game not as a living dex so first i opened the mystery box for the next half hour i was able to catch the requisite pokemon and use pine a prairies to increase my candy yield i then transferred all of those pokemon into let's go to obtain one additional candy this left me five candy short I did something I never do I accessed my horde of rare candies whoa I used five of them my friend Roseau had traded be a shiny of the pre evolution of this week's Pokemon during this year's Pokemon go fest that is the one I selected to evolve the Pokemon I got from all this it has one ability this ability used to be the signature ability of hitmonchan this ability boosts damage from my new pokemons signature move double iron bash there you go all right Willie bill will be back next week we will be back with a little look it's been a long day yep ah just a huge shout out to everyone who left us reviews in Apple
